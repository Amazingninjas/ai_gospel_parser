## Scholarly Value

Joseph Henry Thayer's lexicon, published in 1889, is a comprehensive dictionary of the Greek New Testament. It is an English translation of C. G. Wilke's "Clavis Novi Testamenti," but with significant additions and corrections by Thayer.

For each Greek word, Thayer provides:
- A brief definition.
- Etymological information.
- A list of New Testament passages where the word occurs.
- Detailed explanations of the word's meaning in different contexts.

This lexicon is a standard reference work for the study of the Greek New Testament. For the AI Gospel Parser, the structured nature of the XML file, with its clear demarcation of entries, definitions, and Strong's numbers, makes it an invaluable resource for building a knowledge base of Greek vocabulary.
