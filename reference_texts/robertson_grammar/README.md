## Scholarly Value

A. T. Robertson's grammar is a monumental work, running to over 1400 pages. It was a landmark in the study of New Testament Greek, as it was one of the first grammars to make extensive use of the papyri and other non-literary sources.

Robertson's work demonstrated that the Greek of the New Testament was not a "Holy Ghost" language, but the common, everyday language of the first century. He provides exhaustive detail on all aspects of Greek grammar, from the smallest particles to the most complex syntactical constructions.

For the AI Gospel Parser, this work would be an invaluable resource for understanding the nuances of Greek grammar and syntax. It would allow the AI to move beyond simple vocabulary lookups to a deeper understanding of the relationships between words in a sentence.
