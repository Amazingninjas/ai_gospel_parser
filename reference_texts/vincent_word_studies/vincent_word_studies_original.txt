New-TrsTaAMENnT commentaries are so numerous, and, many 
of them, so good, that a new essay requires some explanation. 
The present work is an attempt in a field which, so far as | am 
aware, is not covered by any one book, though it has been care- 
fully and ably worked by many scholars. Taking a position 
midway between the exegetical commentary and the lexicon 
and grammar, it aims to put the reader of the English Bible 
nearer to the stand-point of the Greek scholar, by opening to 
him the native force of the separate words of the New Testa- 
ment in their lexical sense, their etymology, their history, their 
inflection, and the peculiarities of their usage by different evan- 
gelists and apostles. 

The critical student of the Greek Testament will, therefore, 
find himself here on familiar, and often on rudimental, ground, 
and will understand that the book has not been prepared with 
any design or expectation of instructing him. It has in view, 
first of all, those readers whose ignorance of Greek debars them 
from the quickening contact of the original words, and to whom 
is unknown the very existence of those tracks which the Greek 
scholar threads with unconscious ease and in clear light. 

No scholar will maintain that such a task is rendered super- 
fluous by even the most idiomatic and accurate translation. 
The most conscientious and competent translator is fettered by 
difficulties inherent in the very nature of a translation. Some- 
thing must exhale in the transfer from one language to an- 


vi PREFACE. 


other ; something which is characteristic in proportion to its 
subtlety. Reading an author in a translation is like hearing 
through a telephone. The words may reach the ear distinctly, 
but the quality of the most familiar voice is lost. In transla- 
tion, as in exchange of money, transfer often necessitates break- 
ing up—the destruction of the original symbol, in order to 
embody its contents in the symbols of another tongue. A par- 
ticular coin of one country may have no exact representative in 
acoin of another country; and the difference must be made 
out with small change. A single Greek word often requires 
two or three words for its reproduction in English, and even 
then the partial equivalent must be made good by comment 
or paraphrase. There are, besides, certain features of every 
language, and particularly of every dead language, which defy 
transfer by any process—embodiments of a subtle play of per- 
ception or of thought which has vanished, like the characteris- 
tic expression from a dead face, and which, though it may give 
some hint of itself to an English mind, eludes the grasp of an 
English formula. 

Difficulties like these can be met only by the study of indi- 
vidual words. The translator is compelled to deal mainly with 
the contents of sentences and periods; to make the forms of 
thought subordinate to the substance. A translation which 
should literally reproduce the idiomatic structure of its original 
would be a monstrosity. If the thought is to circulate freely 
and familiarly in Anglo-Saxon society, and to do its best work 
upon Anglo-Saxon minds, it must assume the Anglo-Saxon 
dress. It must modify or abandon its native habits. I¢ can- 
not be continually thrusting into notice its native antecedents, 
and the forms of the life which evolved it. It must be natural- 
ized throughout. Hence the translator is compelled to have 
mainly in view his own audience; to expound the message 
rather than to flatter the nationality of the messenger. He 
cannot stop to show his reader how each constituent word of 


PREFACE. vii 


the original sentence is throbbing with a life of its own, and 
aglow with the fascination of a personal history. This is rather 
the work of the commentator; and not of the commentator 
who explains the meaning and the relation of verses and chap- 
ters, but of one who deals with words in detail, and tells their 
individual stories. 

For a language is not made to order and out of hand. It 
is a growth out of a people’s life; and its words are not arbi- 
trary symbols fixed by decree or by vote, but are struck out, as 
needed, by incidents and crises. They are the formulas in 
which new needs and first impressions of external facts spon- 
taneously voice themselves, and into which social customs run. 
Hence language becomes more picturesque as we recede toward 
its earlier forms. Primitive speech is largely figurative; primi- 
tive words are pictures. As the language becomes the expres- 
sion of a more conventional and artificial life, and of a deeper 
and more complex thought, new words are coined representing 
something more subjective and subtle; and the old words, as 
they become pressed into the new service and stretched to cover 
a wider range of meaning, lose their original sharpness of out- 
line. They pass into conventional symbols in the multiform 
uses of daily speech ; they become commonplace factors of a 
commonplace present, and remain historic only to lexicogra- 
phers and philologists. None the less, these words forever 
carry hidden in their bosom their original pictures and the 
mark of the blow which struck each into life; and they will 
show them to him who lovingly questions them concerning 
their birth and their history. 

These remarks apply in a peculiar manner to the Greek lan- 
guage, which was the outgrowth of a national character at once 
poetic and passionate, logical and speculative, and which was 
shaped by an eventful and romantic history and by a rich and 
powerful literature. The words of a language which traverses 
the period from Homer to Aristotle, from Marathon to Leuc- 


Vill PREFACE. 


tra; which told the stories of Herodotus, carried the mingled 
fire and logic of Demosthenes, voiced the tremendous passion 
of Oedipus, and formulated the dialectic of Plato and the rea- 
soning of Aristotle, must enfold rare treasures; and the more 
as we follow it into its later development under the contact of 
Oriental thought, which fused it in the alembic of Alexandria, 
ran the new combination into the mould of the Septuagint, and 
added the last element necessary to constitute it the bearer of 
the Gospel message. The highest testimony to the resources 
of this wonderful tongue is furnished in its exquisite sensitive- 
ness to the touch of the new faith, and its ready adaptation to 
the expression of the new truth. Its contact with the fresh, 
quickening ideas of the Gospel seemed to evoke from it a cer- 
tain deep-lying quality, overlaid till then by the baser moral 
conceptions of Paganism, but springing up in prompt response 
to the summons of Christian thought and sentiment. Yet 
even the words which lent themselves so readily to the new 
and higher message of Christianity could not abjure their 
lineage or their history. They bore the marks of the older 
and less sacred burdens they had carried. In the histories of 
its choicest words, Christianity asserts itself as a redeemer of 
human speech. The list of New-Testament words lifted out of 
ignoble associations and uses, and mitred as ministers of sacred 
truth, is a long and significant one; and there are few more 
fascinating lines of study than this, to which Archbishop 
Trench long ago directed English readers in his “ Study of 
Words” and his ‘“‘ New-Testament Synonyms.” 

The biblical student may therefore profitably combine two 
distinct lines of study ; the one directed at the truth of seript- 
ure in mass, the other at the medium or vehicle of the truth in 
detail. A thorough comprehension of scripture takes in the 
warp no less than the woof. Labor expended upon etymolo- 
gies, synonyms, and the secrets of particles and tenses, upon 
the wide range of pictures and hints and histories underly- 


PREFACE. 1x 


ing the separate words and phrases of the New Testament, 
is not thrown away, and issues in a larger result than the 
mere accumulation of curious lore. Even as nature fills in the 
space between the foreground and the background of her land- 
scapes with countless details of form and color, light and 
shadow, so the rich details of New-Testament words, once ap- 
prehended, impart a depth of tone and a just relation and per- 
spective to the salient masses of doctrine, narrative, and proph- 
ecy. How much is habitually lost to the English student 
through the use of one and the same term in rendering two 
words which the writer selected with a clear recognition of a 
distinction between them. How often a picture or a bit of his- 
tory is hidden away in a word, of which a translation gives and 
can give no hint. How many distinctive characteristics of a 
writer are lost in a translation. How often, especially in the 
version of 1611, the marvellous play of the Greek tenses, and 
the nicely-calculated force of that potent little instrument, the 
article, are utterly overlooked. As the reader steps securely 
over the carefully-fitted pavement laid for him by modern 
revisers, he does not even guess at the rare and beautiful 
things lying beneath almost every separate block. 

Can the reader who knows no Greek be put in possession of 
these treasures? Not of all; yet certainly of a goodly share of 
them. It has seemed to me that the following results might 
be reached: 

1. Where a word has a history, he may learn it, and may 
be shown through what stages the word has attained its pres- 
ent meaning, and how its variations have successively grown 
out of each other. Llustrations are furnished by such words 
as “ humility,” “ meekness,” ‘“ blessed.” 

2. He may be shown, in part, at least, the peculiar form in 
which a thought comes to a Greek mind; or, in other words, 
he may form some acquaintance with Greek idioms. Thus, to 
take some very simple instances, he can easily see how, wher 


x PREFACE. 


he thinks of his food as set before him on the table, the Greek 
thinks of it as set destde him, and writes accordingly ; or how 
his idea of szdting down to the table comes to the Greek as re- 
clining ; or he can understand how, when Luke says, “ we came 
the next day,” the idea of the next or second day comes to him 
in the form of an adjective qualifying we, so that he thinks of 
himself and his companions as second-day men. Sometimes, 
when two languages develop a difference of idiom in their 
classical usage, the classical idiom of the one reappears in the 
vulgar dialect of the other. The spirit of numerous Greek 
words or phrases, even in the New Testament, could be re- 
produced most faithfully by English expressions which have 
been banished from polite diction. 

3. He can be shown the picture or the figure hidden away 
ina word. See, for example, the note on compel, Matt. v. 41. 

4. He may learn something of Greek synonyms. He may 
be shown how two different Greek words, rendered by the 
same English word, represent different sides or phases of the 
same idea, and why each word is used in its own place. Thus, 
the word “net” occurs in both Matt. iv. 18 and Matt. xiii. 47; 
but the Greek word is different in each verse, and either word 
would have been inappropriate in the place of the other. 

5. He may be shown how two English words, having appar- 
ently no connection with each other, are often expressed by 
the same Greek word; and he may be put in possession of 
the connecting idea. He does not suspect that “bosom,” in 
Luke vi. 38, and “creek” or “bay,” in Acts xxvii. 39, are one 
and the same word; or that there is any connection between 
the “winding up” of Ananias’ body (Acts vy. 6) and Paul’s 
assertion that the time is “short” (1 Cor. vii. 29). 

6. He may be made to understand the reasons for many 
changes of rendering from an older version, which, on their 
face, seem to him arbitrary and useless. 

7. He can be taught something of the characteristic usage of 


PREFACE. Xi 


words and phrases by different authors, and may learn to de- 
tect, even through the English version, certain differences of 
style. (See the Introductions to the different books.) 

8. He can be shown the simpler distinctions between the 
Greek tenses, and the force of the Greek article; and how the 
observance of these distinctions adds to the vigor and liveliness 
of the translation. 

Much valuable matter of this kind is contained in commen- 
taries ; and in some popular commentaries considerable promi- 
nence is given to it, notably in the two admirable works of Dr. 
Morison on Matthew and Mark. But it is scattered over a 
wide surface, and is principally confined to commentaries pre- 
pared for the critical student; while very much lies hidden 
in lexicons and etymological treatises, and in special essays 
distributed through voluminous periodicals. I have collected 
and sifted a large amount of this material from various and 
reliable sources, and have applied it to the treatment of the 
words as they occur, verse by verse, divesting it of technicali- 
ties, and trying to throw it into a form suited to the students of 
the English Bible. 

I had these so prominently in view at the beginning that I 
seriously contemplated the entire omission of Greek words. 
On further thought, however, I decided that my plan might, 
without detriment to the original purpose, be stretched so as 
to include beginners in the study of the Greek Testament, and 
certain college-bred readers who have saved a little Greek out 
of the wreck of their classical studies. For the convenience of 
such I have inserted the original words wherever it seemed ex- 
pedient; but always in parentheses and with the translation 
appended. The English reader may therefore be assured that 
any value which the book may have for him will not be im- 
paired by the presence of the unfamiliar characters. He has 
but to pass them over, and to confine his attention to the Eng. 
lish text. 


xii PREFACE. 


It is evident that my purpose relieves me of the duty of the 
exegesis of passages, save in those cases where the word under 
consideration is the point on which the meaning of the entire 
passage turns. The temptation to overstep this limit has been 
constantly present, and it is not impossible that I may have 
occasionally transgressed. But the pleasure and the value of 
the special study of words will, I think, be enhanced for the 
student by detaching it from the jungle of exegetical matter in 
which, in ordinary commentaries, it is wellnigh lost. 

A few words should be said respecting a name which the 
title of this book will at once suggest to New-Testament stu- 
dents—I mean Bengel. The indebtedness of al! workers in this 
field to John Albert Bengel it is not easy to overstate. His 
well-known “Gnomon,” which still maintains a high and hon- 
orable rank among commentaries after the lapse of nearly a 
century and a half, was the pioneer in this method of treating 
scripture. My own obligations to him are very great for the 
impulse to this line of study which I received in translating the 
“Gnomon” more than twenty-five years ago ; more for that, in- 
deed, than for any large amount of help in the present work. 
For his own labors have contributed to the great extension 
of his special line of study since the appearance of the “ Gno- 
mon” in 1742. The entire basis of New-Testament philology 
and textual criticism has been shifted and widened, and many 
of his critical conclusions, therefore, must be either modified or 
rejected. His work retains its value for the preacher. He 
must always stand pre-eminent for his keen and deep spiritual 
insight, and for that marvellously terse and pithy diction with 
which, as with a master-key, he so often throws open by a sin- 
gle turn the secret chambers of a word ; but for critical results 
the student must follow later and surer guides. 

As to materials, let it suffice to say that I have freely used 
whatever I have found serviceable. The book, however, is not 
a compilation. My plan has compelled me to avoid lengthy 


PREFACE. xiii 


discussions and processes, and to confine myself mostly to the 
statement of results. In order to avoid encumbering the pages 
with a multitude of references, I have appended a list of the 
sources on which I have drawn; and the names of other authors 
not mentioned there will be found appended to quotations. 

I have not attempted textual criticism. I have followed 
principally the text of Westcott and Hort, comparing it with 
Tischendorf’s eighth edition, and commonly adopting any read- 
ing in which the two agree. It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary 
to say that the very literal and often uncouth renderings which 
frequently occur are given merely in order to throw sentences 
or phrases as nearly as possible into their Greek form, and are 
not suggested for adoption as versions. Each word or passage 
commented upon is cited first according to the authorized ver- 
sion. 

My task has been a labor of love, though pursued amid the 
numerous distractions and varied duties of a city pastorate. I 
hope to complete it in due time by an additional volume con- 
taining the writings of John and Paul. 

It is said that there was discovered, some years ago, in one 
of our Western States, a magnificent geode, which, on being 
broken, disclosed a mass of crystals arranged in the form of a 
cross. It will be a great joy to me if, by this attempt to break 
the shell of these words of life, and to lay bare their hidden 
jewels, I may help a Bible-student here and there to a clearer 
vision of that cross which is the centre and the glory of the 


Gospel.

PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION. 


In this second edition a number of errors in the Scripture 
references have been corrected, together with sundry typo- 
graphical mistakes in the Greek text,such as misplaced accents, 
omitted breathings, etc. A few changes have also been made 
in accordance with the suggestions of my reviewers. For many 
of the corrections in the Greek text I am under great obliga- 
tions to my old friend Dr. Henry Drisler, of Columbia College, 
whose invaluable aid it would never have occurred to me to ask 
in such a matter of literary drudgery, but who voluntarily, and 
most kindly, furnished me with a list of the errors noted by 
him in his perusal of the volume.

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW. 


INTRODUCTION. 


Concerntnc Matthew personally we know very little. He 
was a son of Alpheus, a brother of James the Little, possibly 
a brother of Thomas Didymus. The only facts which the gos- 
pels record about him are his call and his farewell feast. He 
had been a publican or tax-collector under the Roman govern- 
ment; an office despised by the Jews because of the extortions 
which commonly attended it, and because it was a galling token 
of subjection to a foreign power. When called by Christ, 
Matthew forsook at once his office and his old name of Levi. 
Tradition records of him that he lived the life of an ascetic, on 
herbs and water. There is a legend that after the dispersion of 
the apostles he travelled into Egypt and Ethiopia preaching 
the Gospel; that he was entertained in the capital of Ethiopia 
in the house of the eunuch whom Philip baptized, and that he 
overcame two magicians who had afflicted the people with 
diseases. It is further related that he raised the son of the 
king of Egypt from the dead, healed his daughter Iphigenia of 
leprosy, and placed her at the head of a community of virgins 
dedicated to the service of God; and that a heathen king, at- 
tempting to tear her from her asylum, was smitten with leprosy, 
and his palace destroyed by fire. 

According to the Greek legend he died in peace ; but accord- 
ing to the tradition of the Western Church he suffered mar- 
tyrdom. 

Mrs. Jameson (‘‘ Sacred and Legendary Art”) says: “ Few 
churches are dedicated to St. Matthew. I am not aware that 


2 INTRODUCTION. 


he is the patron saint of any country, trade, or profession, un- 
less it be that of tax-gatherer or exciseman ; and this is perhaps 
the reason that, except where he figures as one of the series of 
evangelists or apostles, he isso seldom represented alone, or in 
devotional pictures. When he is portrayed as an evangelist, 
he holds a book ora pen; and the angel, his proper attribute and 
attendant, stands by, pointing up to heaven or dictating, or he 
holds the inkhorn, or he supports the book. In his character of 
apostle, St. Matthew frequently holds a purse or money-bag, 
as significant of his former vocation.” 

Matthew wrote, probably in Palestine, and evidently for Jew- 
ish Christians. There are two views as to the language in 
which his gospel was originally composed : one that he wrote it 
in Hebrew or Syro-Chaldaic, the dialect spoken in Palestine by 
the Jewish Christians; the other that he wroteitinGreek. The 
former theory is supported by the unanimous testimony of the 
early church ; and the fathers who assert this, also declare that 
his work was translated into Greek. In that case the transla- 
tion was most probably made by Matthew himself, or under his 
supervision. The drift of modern scholarship, however, is 
toward the theory of a Greek original. Great uncertainty pre- 
vails as to the time of composition. According to the testimony 
of the earliest Christian fathers, Matthew’s gospel is the first in 
order, though the internal evidence favors the priority of Mark. 
Evidently it was written before the destruction of Jerusalem 
(av. 70). ‘Had that event preceded the writing of the sy- 
noptic gospels and the epistles of St. Paul, nothing is more 
certain than that it must have been directly mentioned, and that 
it must have exercised an immense influence on the thoughts 
and feelings of the apostles and evangelists. No writer deal- 
ing with the topics and arguments and prophecies with which 
they are constantly occupied, could possibly have failed to ap- 
peal to the tremendous sanction which had been given to all 
their views by God himself, who thus manifested his provi- 
dence in human history, and showed all things by the quiet 
light of inevitable circumstances” (Farrar, “ Messages of the 
Books ”’). 

Matthew’s object was to exhibit the Gospel as the fulfilment. 


INTRODUCTION. 3 


of the law and the prophecies; to connect the past with the 
present ; to show that Jesus was the Messiah of the Jews, and 
that in the Old Testament the New was prefigured, while in the 
New Testament the Old was revealed. Hence his gospel has a 
more decidedly Jewish flavor than any other of the synoptics. 
The sense of Jewish nationality appears in the record of Christ’s 
words about the “ lost sheep of the house of Israel” (xv. 24); in 
the command not to go into the way of the Gentiles nor into 
the villages of the Samaritans (x. 5); in the prophecy that the 
apostles shall sit as judges in “the regeneration” (xix. 28). 
Also in the tracing of the genealogy of our Lord no further 
back than to Abraham; in the emphasis laid on the works of 
the law (v. 19; xii. 33, 387); and in the prophecy which makes 
the end of Israel contemporaneous with the “ consummation 
of the age ” (xxiv. 3, 22; x. 28). 

On the other hand, a more comprehensive character appears 
in the adoration of the infant Jesus by the Gentile magi; in 
the prophecy of the preaching of the Gospel of the kingdom 
to all the world (xxiv. 14), and the apostolic commission to go 
to all nations (xxviii. 19) ; in the commendation of the faith of 
a Gentile above that of Israel (viii. 10-12; compare the story 
of the Syrophcenician woman, xv. 28); in the use of the word 
“ Jews,” as if he were outside the circle of Jewish nationality ; 
in the parables of the laborers in the vineyard (xx. 1-16), and 
of the marriage of the king’s son (xxii. 1-14); in the threat of 
taking away the kingdom from Israel (xxi. 48), and in the value 
attached to the moral and religious element of the law (xxii. 40 ; 
xxiii. 23). The genealogy of Jesus contains the Gentile names 
of Rahab the Canaanite, and Ruth the Moabitess. To Matthew 
Jesus is alike the Messiah of the Jew and the Saviour of the 
world. 

It being his task to show how the law and the prophets were 
fulfilled in Christ, his allusions are frequent to the Old Testa- 
ment seriptures. He has upward of sixty references to the 
Old Testament. His citations are of two classes: those which 
he quotes himself as fulfilled in the events of Christ’s life, such 
as i. 23; ii. 15, 18; iv. 15,16; and those which are a part of 
the discourse of his different characters, such as iii. 3; iv. 4, 6, 


4 INTRODUCTION. 


7,10; xv. 4, 8,9. He exhibits the law of Christ, not only as 
the fulfilment of the Mosaic law, but in contrast with it, as is 
illustrated in the Sermon on the Mount. Yet, while represent- 
ing the new law as gentler than the old, he represents it, at the 
same time, as more stringent (see v. 28, 32, 34, 39, 44). His 
gospel is of a sterner type than Luke’s, which has been rightly 
styled “the Gospel of universality and tolerance.” The retribu- 
tive element is more prominent in it. Sin appeals to him 
primarily as the violation of law; and therefore his word for 
iniquity is dvouia, lawlessness, which occurs nowhere else in the 
Gospels. He alone records the saying, “ Many are called, but 
few are chosen ” (xxii. 14), and, as Professor Abbot has acute- 
ly remarked, the distinction between the called («dyrot) and 
the chosen (éxdexrol) is the more remarkable, because Paul uses 
the two words almost indifferently, and Luke, although he too 
has the parable of the unworthy guests, has not ventured to use 
kdytol in Matthew’s disparaging signification (Art. “ Gospels,” 
in Encyelop. Britannica). To him, also, is peculiar the record 
of the saying that ‘ Whosoever shall break one of the least 
commandments, and teach men so, shall be called least in the 
kingdom of heaven” (v. 19). To continue the quotation from 
Professor Abbot, ‘ Matthew, more than the rest of the evangel- 
ists, seems to move in evil days, and amid a race of backsliders, 
among dogs and swine, who are unworthy of the pearls of 
truth ; among the tares sown by the enemy; among fishermen 
who have to cast back again many of the fish caught in the net 
of the Gospel. The broad way is ever in his mind, and the 
multitude of those that go thereby, and the guest without the 
wedding garment, and the foolish virgins, and the goats as well 
as the sheep, and those who even cast out devils in the name of 
the Lord, and yet are rejected by him because they work ‘ law- 
lessness.” Where Luke speaks exultantly of joy in heaven over 
one repentant sinner, Matthew, in more negative and sober 
phrases, declares that it is not the will of the Father that one 
of the little ones should perish; and as a reason for not being 
distracted about the future, it is alleged that ‘sufficient for the 
day is the evil thereof.’ The condition of the Jews, their increas- 
ing hostility to the Christians, and the wavering or retrogres- 


INTRODUCTION. 5 


sion of many Jewish converts when the hostility became inten- 
sified shortly before and during the siege of Jerusalem—this 
may well explain one side of Matthew’s gospel; and the other 
side (the condemnation of ‘ lawlessness ’) might find an explana- 
tion in a reference to Hellenizing Jews, who (like some of the 
Corinthians) considered that the new law set them free from all 
restraint, and who, in casting aside every vestige of nationality, 
wished to cast aside morality as well. Viewed in the light of 
the approaching fall of Jerusalem, and the retrogression of 
great masses of the nation, the introduction into the Lord’s 
Prayer of the words ‘ Deliver us from the evil,’ and the predic- 
tion that ‘by reason of the multiplying of lawlessness the love 
of many shall wax cold,’ will seem not only appropriate, but 
typical of the character of the whole of the First Gospel.” 

As related to the other synoptical gospels, Matthew’s contains 
fourteen entire sections which are peculiar to him alone. These 
include ten parables: The Tares; the Hid Treasure; the 
Pearl; the Draw-net; the Unmerciful Servant ; the Laborers in 
the Vineyard; the Two Sons; the Marriage of the King’s 
Son; the Ten Virgins, and the Talents. Two miracles: The 
Cure of Two Blind Men, and the Coin in the Fish’s Mouth. 
Four events of the infancy: The Visit of the Magi; the Mas- 
sacre of the Infants; the Flight into Egypt, and the Return to 
Nazareth. Seven incidents connected with the Passion and the 
Resurrection: the Bargain and Suicide of Judas; the Dream 
of Pilate’s Wife; the Resurrection of the Departed Saints; 
the Watch at the Sepulchre; the Story of the Sanhedrim, and 
the Earthquake on the Resurrection Morning. Ten great pas- 
sages of our Lord’s discourses: Parts of Sermon on the Mount 
(v.-vii.); the Revelation to Babes; the Invitations to the Weary 
(xi. 25-30) ; Idle Words (xii. 36, 37); the Prophecy to Peter 
(xvi. 17-19); Humility and Forgiveness (xviii. 15-35) ; Rejec- 
tion of the Jews (xxi. 48); the Great Denunciation (xxiii.) ; 
the Discourse about Last Things (xxv. 31-46); the Great Com- 
mission and Promise (xxviii. 18-20). 

Hence Matthew’s is pre-eminently the didactic Gospel, one- 
quarter of the whole being occupied with the actual words and 
discourses of the Lord. 


6 INTRODUCTION. 


Matthew is less characteristic in style than in arrangement and 
matter. The orderly, business-like traits which had been fos- 
tered by his employment as a publican, appear in his methodical 
arrangement and grouping of his subject. His narrative is more 
sober and less graphic than either Mark’s or Luke’s. The pict- 
ure of our Lord’s life, character, and work, as Teacher, Saviour, 
and Messianic King, is painted simply, broadly, and boldly, but 
without minute detail, such as abounds in Mark. His diction 
and construction are the most Hebraistic of the synoptists, 
though less so than those of John’s gospel. The following 
Hebrew peculiarities are to be noted: 1. The phrase, King- 
dom of Heaven (Bactreia tov odpavev), which occurs thirty- 
two times, and is not found in the other evangelists, who use 
Kingdom of God. 2. Hather in Heaven, or Heavenly Father 
(0 matip o év ovpavois: 0 TatTHp Oo ovpamos). This occurs fif- 
teen times in Matthew, only twice in Mark, and not at all in 
Luke, xi. 2 being a false reading. 38. Son of David, seven 
times in Matthew, three in Mark, three in Luke. 4. The Holy 
City (Jerusalem), in Matthew only. 5. The end of the world, or 
consummation of the age (n cvvTédeva Tod aidvos), in Matthew 
only. 6. In order that wt might be fulfilled which was spoken 
(iva or Oras TANnpaSH TO pyIév), eight times in Matthew, and not 
elsewhere in this form. This is Matthew’s characteristic for- 
mula. 7. That which was spoken (76 pyndév), twelve times; /¢ 
was spoken (éppndn), six times. Not elsewhere used of script- 
ure, for Mark xiii. 14 is a false reading. Matthew always 
uses that which was spoken (ro pn3év) when quoting scripture 
himself. In other quotations he has /¢ 2s written (yéyoamrat), 
like the other evangelists. He never uses the singular ypady 
(properly @ passage of scripture). 8. And behold (rai idov), in 
narrative, twenty-three times; in Luke, sixteen. 9. Heathen 
(€9vexes), in Matthew only. 10. To swear in (6uvdew ev, i.e., by), 
thirteen times, in Matthew and Apoc. x. 6. 

A number of words condemned by the grammarians as un- 
classical or as slang are employed by Mark, and a few of these 
may be found in Matthew, such as wovddIaruos, having one eye ; 
KodduBiotat, money-changers ; Kopacvov, maid ; pais, a needle. 
He also uses some Latinisms, three at least in common with 


INTRODUCTION. "¢ 


Mark : wpautwpiov, pretorium ; Kivoos, tribute; pparyedd0oo, 
to scourge; also Kovetwdia, guard, peculiar to him alone. 

He frequently uses the words to come or go (mpocépxyopat, 
mropéve) after the oriental manner, to expand his narrative ; as, 
when the tempter came he said (iv. 8) ; a centurion came beseech- 
ing (viii. 5); a scribe came and said (viii. 19) ; the disciples of 
John came, saying (ix. 14). The former of these verbs (zpocep- 
oar) occurs fifty-one times, while in Mark it is found but six 
times, and in Luke, ten. The word évap, a dream, is used by 
him alone in the New Testament, and always in the phrase cat’ 
dva;, in a dream. It occurs six times. Tddos, a tomb, is also 
peculiar to him, the other evangelists using pvfjua or [UN LELov, 
the latter being used also by Matthew. 06 Neydpevos, who vs called, 
is a favorite expression in announcing names or surnames (i. 
16; x.2; xxvi.3,14). He adds of the people to scribes or elders 
(Gi. 4; xxi. 23; xxvi. 3, 47; xxvii. 1). He writes, into the 
name (eis td 6vowa), where the other evangelists have év, 2m, or 
éri, upon (x. 41, 42; xvii. 20; xxviii. 19). His favorite parti- 
cle of transition is tére, then, which occurs ninety times, to six 
in Mark and fourteen in Luke (ii. 7; iii. 5; viii. 265 xi. 20, 
etc.). There are about a hundred and twenty words which are 
used by him alone in the New Testament. T'wo instances oc- 
cur of a play upon words: agavifover pavdor, they make their 
real faces disappear, in order that they may appear Cvin lO) 
Kaxovs Kaxeas, he will evilly destroy those evil husbandmen ” 
(xxi. 41). 

The writer is utterly merged in his narrative. The very lack 
of individuality in his style corresponds with the fact that, with 
the single exception of the incident of his call and feast, he does 
not appear in his gospel, even as asking a question. It has been 
suggested that traces of his old employment appear in the use 
of the word tribute-money, instead of penny, and in the record 
of the miracle of the coin in the fish’s mouth; but the name 
“ Matthew the publican” serves rather to emphasize his ob- 
scurity. The Jew who received the Messiah he portrayed 
could never lose his disgust for the office and class which he 
represented. A gospel written by a publican would seem least 
of all adapted to reach the very people to whom it was addressed. 


8 INTRODUCTION. 


Whether or not the perception of this fact may have combined 
to produce this reticence, with the humility engendered by his 
contemplation of his Lord, certain it is that the evangelist 
himself is completely hidden behind the bold, broad masses in 
which are depicted the Messiah of Jewish hope, the Saviour of 
mankind, the consummate flower of the ancient law, and the per- 
fect life and unrivalled teaching of the Son of David. 


THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW. 


SUPERSCRIP TION. 


The Gospel (evayyédvov). Signifies originally a present given 
in return for joyful news. Thus Homer makes Ulysses say to 
Eumeus, “ Let this reward edayyédov be given me for my good 
news” (Od., xiv. 152). In Attic Greek it meant (in the plural) 
a sacrifice for good tidings. Later it comes to mean the good 
news itself—the joyful tidings of Messiah’s kingdom. Though 
the word came naturally to be used as the title of books con- 
taining the history of the good tidings, in the New Testament 
itself it is never employed in the sense of a written book, but 
always means the word preached. 


According to(«ard). This is not the same as the phrase 
Gospel of Matthew. The Gospel is God’s, not Matthew’s nor 
Luke’s; and is substantially one and the same in all the evan- 
gelists’ writings. The words “according to,” therefore, imply 
a generic element in the Gospel which Matthew has set forth in 
his own peculiar style. The meaning is, the good tidings of the 
kingdom, as delivered or represented by Matthew. 


Matthew (Mar9aiov). The names Matthew and Levi denote 
the same person (Matt. ix. 9; Mark ii. 14; Luke v. 277). The 
name Levi is wanting in all lists of the apostles, but Matthew is 
named in all these lists. The Jews marked decisive changes in 
their life by a change of name (compare Simon and Peter; Saul 
and Paul); so that it is evident that Levi, after his call to the 
apostolate, styled himself Matthew, a contracted form of the 


10 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. L 


Hebrew Mattathias, meaning gift of God ; a name reproduced 
in the Greek Theodore (Oe6s, God; Sépor, a gift). This name 
so completely displaced the old one that it is anticipated by 
Matthew himself in ch. ix. 9, where he is called Matthew ; 
whereas Mark and Luke, in narrating his call, more correctly 
style him Levi (Mark ui. 14; Luke v. 27); while in their lists 
of the apostles (Mark iii. 18; Luke vi.15; Acts i. 13) they 
rightly call him Matthew. 


CHAPTER J. 


Ver. 1. Christ (Xpucrds). Properly an adjective, not a noun, 
and meaning anointed (yplw, to anoint). It is a translation of 
the Hebrew Messiah, the king and spiritual ruler from David's 
race, promised under that name in the Old Testament (Ps. ii. 
2; Dan. ix. 25, 26). Hence Andrew says to Simon, “ We have 
found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, Christ (John i. 
41; compare Acts iv. 27; x. 38; xix.28). Tous “Christ ” has 
become a proper name, and is therefore written without the 
definite article; but, inthe body of the gospel narratives, since 
the identity of Jesus with the promised Messiah is still in ques- 
tion with the people, the article is habitually used, and the name 
should therefore be translated “ the Christ.” After the resur- 
rection, when the recognition of Jesus as Messiah has become 
general, we find the word beginning to be used as a proper 
name, with or without the article. In this passage it omits the 
article, because it occurs in the heading of the chapter, and ex- 
presses the evangelist’s own faith in Jesus as the Messiah. 

Anointing was applied to kings (1 Sam. ix. 16; x. 1), to 
prophets (1 Kings xix. 16), and to priests (Exod. xxix. 29; xl. 
15 ; Lev. xvi. 32) at theirinauguration. “The Lord’s anointed ” 
was a common title of the king (1 Sam. xii. 8, 5; 2 Sam. i. 14, 
16). Prophets are called ‘“Messiahs,” or anointed ones qd 
Chron. xvi. 22; Ps. cv. 15). Cyrus is also called “the Lord’s 
Anointed,” because called to the throne to deliver the Jews out 
of captivity (Isa. xlv. 1). Hence the word “ Christ ” was repre- 


Cu. LJ MATTHEW. 11 


sentative of our Lord, who united in himself the offices of king, 
prophet, and priest. 

It is interesting to see how anointing attaches to our Lord in 
other and minor particulars. Anointing was an act of hospi- 
tality and a sign of festivity and cheerfulness. Jesus was 
anointed by the woman when a guest in the house of Simon 
the Pharisee, and rebuked his host for omitting this mark of 
respect toward him (Luke vii. 35, 46). In the Epistle to the 
Hebrews (i. 8, 9), the words of the Messianic psalm (xlv. 7) are 
applied to Jesus, “ God, even thy God, hath anointed thee 
with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.” 

Anointing was practised upon the sick (Mark vi. 13; Luke x. 
34; Jas. v. 14). Jesus, “the Great Physician,” is described by 
Isaiah (Ixi. 1,2; compare Luke iv. 18) as anointed by God to 
bind up the broken-hearted, and to give the mournful the o2d of 
joy for mourning. He himself anointed the eyes of the blind 
man (John ix. 6, 11); and the twelve, in his name, “ anointed 
with oil many that were sick, and healed them ” (Mark vi. 18). 

Anointing was practised upon the dead. Of her who brake 
the alabaster upon his head at Bethany, Jesus said, ‘She hath 
anointed my body aforehand for the burying ” (Mark xiv. 8; 
see, also, Luke xxiii. 56). 


The Son (vids). The word réxvov (child) is often used in- 
terchangeably with vios (son), but is never applied to Christ. 
(For réxvov, see on 1 John iii. 1.) While in téxvov there is 
commonly implied the passive or dependent relation of the 
children to the parents, vids fixes the thought on the person 
himself rather than on the dependence upon his parents. It 
suggests individuality rather than descent; or, if descent, 
mainly to bring out the fact that the son was worthy of his 
parent. Hence the word marks the filial relation as carrying 
with it privilege, dignity, and freedom, and is, therefore, the 
only appropriate term to express Christ’s sonship. (See John i. 
18; iii. 16; Rom. viii. 29; Col. i. 13, 15.) Through Christ 
the dignity of sons is bestowed on believers, so that the same 
word is appropriate to Christians, sons of God. (See Rom. viii. 
14; ix. 26; Gal. iii. 26; iv. 5, 6, 7.) 


12 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. L. 


6. David the king (Tov Aaveld tov Bacrréa, “ the David, the 
king”). Both words are thus emphasized: the David from 
whom Christ, if he were the Messiah, mwst have descended ; 
the king with whom the Messiah’s genealogy entered upon the 
kingly dignity. In this genealogy, where the generations are 
divided symmetrically into three sets of fourteen, the evangelist 
seems to connect the last of each set with a critical epoch in the 
history of Israel: the first reaching from the origin of the race 
to the commencement of the monarchy (“ David the king”); 
the second, from the commencement of the monarchy to the 
captivity in Babylon; the third and last, from the captivity to 
the coming of “the Christ.” The same emphatic or demon- 
strative use of the article occurs with the name of Joseph (ver. 
16), marking his peculiar relation to Jesus as the husband of 
Mary: the Joseph, the husband of Mary. 


18. Espoused (uvnotevSeions: Rev., betrothed; Tyn., maryed). 
The narrative implies a distinction between betrothal and mar- 
riage. From the moment of her betrothal a woman was treated 
as if actually married. The union could be dissolved only by 
regular divorce. Breach of faithfulness was regarded as adul- 
tery, and was punishable with death (Deut. xxii. 23, 24), and 
the woman’s property became virtually that of her betrothed, 
unless he had expressly renounced it; but, even in that case, 
he was her natural heir. 


19. Not willing (4) Sé\ev)—was minded (éBovryS7). 
These two words, describing the working of Joseph’s mind, 
and evidently intended to express different phases of thought, 
open the question of their distinctive meanings in the New 
Testament, where they frequently occur (Sé\m much oftener 
than Bovowar), and where the rendering, in so many cases by 
the same words, furnishes no clue to the distinction. The origi- 
nal words are often used synonymously in cases where no dis- 
tinction is emphasized ; but their use in other cases reveals a 
radical and recognized difference. An interchange is inad- 
mnissible when the greater force of the expression requires 
Sékew. For instance, BovrAeoSac would be entirely inappro- 


Cx. LJ MATTHEW. 13 


priate at Matt. viii. 3, “ I will, be thou cleansed ;” or at 
Rom. vii. 15. 

The distinction, which is abundantly illustrated in Homer, is 
substantially maintained by the classical writers throughout, 
and in the New Testament. 

Ow is the stronger word, and expresses a purpose or de- 
termination or decree, the execution of which is, or is believed 
to be, in the power of him who wills. Bovrcoatr expresses 
wish, inclination, or disposition, whether one desires to do a 
thing himself or wants some one else to do it. Oérew, there- 
fore, denotes the active resolution, the will urging on to action. 
Botarec$ar is to have a mind, to desire, sometimes a little 
stronger, running into the sense of purpose. Oérew indicates 
the impulse of the will; BovrAecIa1, its tendency. BovrraSar 
can always be rendered by Jérewv, but Jédrew cannot always be 
expressed by BovAeoSau. 

Thus, Agamemnon says, “I would not (ovx &Jedov) receive 
the ransom for the maid (z.e., 1 refused to receive), because I 
greatly desire (BovAopav) to have her at home ” (Homer, “ I.,” 
i. 112). So Demosthenes: “It is fitting that you should be 
willing (é9érew) to listen to those who wish (Bovropéver) to ad- 
vise” (“Olynth.,” i. 1). That is to say, It is in your power to 
determine whether or not you will listen to those who desire to 
advise you, but whose power to do so depends on your consent. 
Again : “If the gods will it (9éwor) and you wish it (BovrAnate)” 
(Demosth., “ Olynth.,” ii. 20).* 

In the New Testament, as observed above, though the words 
are often interchanged, the same distinction isrecognized. Thus, 
Matt. ii. 18, “Rachael would not (7Sere) be comforted ;” obsti- 
nately and positively refused. Joseph, having the right and 
power under the (assumed) circumstances to make Mary a pub- 
lic example, resolved (Sédwv) to spare her this exposure. Then 
the question arose—W hat should he do? On this he thought, 








* A full discussion of the classical usage would require an essay. The 
critical student is referred to the article BobrAccSau in Schmidt's Synonymik der 
Griechischen Sprache, vol. iii, p. 602. See, also, the art, 94a, in Grimm’s 
Clavis Nov. Test. His classification of meanings, however, needs careful re: 
vision.

and, having thought (évIvunIévros), his mind inclined (ten- 
dency), he was minded (éBovdyjIn) to put her away secretly. 

Some instances of the interchanged use of the two words are 
the following: Mark xv. 15, “Pilate welling” (Bovddpevos) ; 
compare Luke xxiii. 20, “Pilate willing” (Sérov). Acts 
xxvii. 43, “The centurion willing” (Govdopevos) ; Matt. xxvii. 
17, “ Whom wild ye that I release” (9édere) ; so ver. 21. John 
xviii. 39, “ Weld ye that I release” (BovrAec Se); Matt. xiv. 5, 
“When he would have put him to death” (9érwv). Mark vi. 
48, “He would have passed by them” (#9ede); Acts xix. 30, 
“Paul would have entered” (Govropuévov). Acts xviii. 27, 
“ He was disposed to pass” (Bovdopévov). Tit. iii. 8, “I will 
that thou affirm ” (BovAouar). Mark vi. 25, “I will that thou 
give me” (JéAw), etc., ete. 

In the New Testament 9éAw occurs in the following senses: 

1. A decree or determination of the will. (a) Of God (Matt. 
xii. 7; Rom. ix. 16, 18; Acts xviii. 21; 1 Cor. iv. 19; xii.18; 
xv. 88). (6) Of Christ (Matt. viii. 3; John xvii. 24; v. 21; 
xxi, 22). (c) Of men (Acts xxv. 9). Festus, having the power 
to gratify the Jews, and determining to do 80, says to Paul, who 
has the right to decide, “ Wilt thow go up to Jerusalem ?” 
John vi. 67, Others of the disciples had decided to leave 
Jesus. Christ said to the twelve, “Will ye also go away?” Is 
that your determination ? John vii. 17, If any man sets his 
will, is determined to do God’s will. John viii. 44, The lusts 
of your father your will zs set to do. Acts xxiv. 6. 

2. A wish or desire. Very many of the passages, however,’ 
which are cited under this head (as by Grimm) may fairly be 
interpreted as implying something stronger than a wish ; nota- 
bly Mark xiv. 36, of Christ in Gethsemane. Our Lord would 
hardly have used what thow wilt in so feeble a sense as that of 
a desire or wish on God’s part. Mark x. 43, “Whosoever 
will be great,” expresses more than the desire for greatness. It 
is the purpose of the life. Matt. xxvii. 15, It was given to 
the Jews to decide what prisoner should be released. Luke i. 
62, The name of the infant John was referred to Zacharias’ 
decision. John xvii. 24, Surely Christ does more than desire 
that those whom the Father has given him shall be with him. 


Cay hil MATTHEW. 15 


Luke ix. 54, It is for Jesus to command fire upon the 
Samaritan villagesif he so wills. (See, also, John xv. 7; 1 Cor. 
iv. 21; Matt. xvi. 25; xix. 17; John xxi. 22; Matt. xiii. 28; 
xvii. 12.) In the sense of wish or desire may fairly be cited 2 
Cor. xi. 12; Matt. xii. 38; Luke viii. 20; xxiii. 8; John xii. 
21; Gal. iv. 20; Matt. vii. 12; Mark x. 35. 

3. A liking (Mark xii. 38; Luke xx. 46; Matt. xxvii. 43). 
(See note there.) 

BovAouaz occurs in the following senses: 

1. Inclination or disposition (Acts xviii. 27; xix. 30; xxv. 
22; xxviii. 18; 2 Cor. i. 15). 

2. Stronger, with the idea of purpose (1 Tim. vi. 9; James 
iioevui, 4-21 Cor xiii1s Heb. yi417): 

In most, if not all of these cases, we might expect Sérewv ; 
but in this use of BovAouas there is an implied emphasis on the 
element of free choice or self-determination, which imparts to 
the desire or inclination a decretory force. This element is in the 
human will by gift and consent. In the divine will it is inherent. 
At this point the Homeric usage may be compared in its occa- 
sional employment of BovAowas to express determination, but 
only with reference to the gods, in whom to wish is to will. 
Thus, “ Whether Apollo wild (Botderax) ward off the plague” 
(“T.,” i. 67). “Apollo willed (Bovdero) victory to the Tro- 
jans” (“I1.,” vii. 21). 


To make a public example (Sevyparicas). The word is 
kindred to Seievups, to exhibit, display, point out. Here, there- 
fore, to expose Mary to public shame (Wyc., publish her ; 'Tyn., 
defame her). The word occurs in Coloss. ii. 15, of the victo- 
rious Saviour displaying the vanquished powers of evil as a 
general displays his trophies or captives in a triumphal proces- 
sion. “He made a show of them openly.” A compound of 
the same word (srapadevyparifw) appears in Heb. vi. 6, “ They 
crucify the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.” 


21. Shalt call. Thus committing the office of a father to 
Joseph. The naming of the unborn Messiah would accord with 
popular notions. The Rabbis had a saying concerning the six

whose names were given before their birth: “Isaac, Ishmael, 
Moses, Solomon, Josiah, and the name of the Messiah, whom 
may the Holy One, blessed be His name, bring quickly in our 
days.” 


Jesus (Incovv). The Greek form of a Hebrew name, which 
had been borne by two illustrious individuals in former periods 
of the Jewish history—Joshua, the successor of Moses, and 
Jeshua, the high-priest, who with Zerubbabel took so active a 
part in the re-establishment of the civil and religious polity of 
the Jews on their return from Babylon. Its original and full 
form is Jehoshua, becoming by contraction-/Joshua or Jeshua. 
Joshua, the son of Nun, the successor of Moses, was originally 
named Hoshea (saving), which was altered by Moses into 
JSehoshua (Jehovah (our) Salwation) (Num. xiii. 16). The mean- 
ing of the name, therefore, finds expression in the title Saviour, 
applied to our Lord (Luke i. 47; ii. 11; John iv. 42). 

Joshua, the son of Nun, is a type of Christ in his office of 
captain and deliverer of his people, in the military aspect of 
his saving work (Apoc. xix. 11-16). As God’s revelation to 
Moses was in the character of a law-giver, his revelation to 
Joshua was in that of the Lord of Hosts (Josh. v. 13, 14). 
Under Joshua the enemies of Israel were conquered, and the 
people established in the Promised Land. So Jesus leads his 
people in the fight with sin and temptation. He is the leader 
of the faith which overcomes the world (Heb. xii. 2). Follow- 
ing him, we enter into rest. 

The priestly office of Jesus is foreshadowed in the high-priest 
Jeshua, who appears in the vision of Zechariah (ch. iii.; compare 
Ezra ii. 2) in court before God, under accusation of Satan, and 
clad in filthy garments. Jeshua stands not only for himself, 
but as the representative of sinning and suffering Israel. Satan 
is defeated. The Lord rebukes him, and declares that he will 
redeem and restore this erring people; and in token thereof he 
commands that the accused priest be clad in clean robes and 
crowned with the priestly mitre. 

Thus in this priestly Jeshua we have a type of our “ Great 
High-Priest, touched with the feeling of our infirmities, and 


Cu. 1] MATTHEW. ii. 


in all points tempted and tried like as we are;” confronting 
Satan in the wilderness ; trying conclusions with him upon the 
victims of his malice—the sick, the sinful, and the demon-ridden. 
His royal robes are left behind. He counts not “equality with 
God a thing to be grasped at,” but “empties himself,” taking 
the “form of a servant,’ humbling himself and becoming 
“ obedient even unto death ” (Philip. ii. 6,7, Rev.). He assumes 
the stained garments of our humanity. He who “knew no 
sin” is “ made to be sin on our behalf, that we might become 
the righteousness of God in him” (2 Cor. v. 21). He is at once 
priest and victim. He pleads for sinful man before God’s 
throne. He will redeem him. He will rebuke the malice and 
cast down the power of Satan. He will behold him “as lightning 
fall from heaven” (Luke x. 18). He will raise and save and 
purify men of weak natures, rebellious wills, and furious pas- 
sions—cowardly braggarts and deniers like Peter, persecutors 
like Saul of Tarsus, charred brands—and make them witnesses 
of his grace and preachers of his love and power. His king- 
dom shall be a kingdom of priests, and the song of his redeemed 
church shall be, “ unto him that loveth us, and loosed us from 
our sins by his own blood, and made us to be a kingdom, to be 
priests unto his God and Father; to him be the glory and the 
dominion forever and ever. Amen” (Apoe. i. 5, 6, in Rev.). 

It is no mere fancy which sees a suggestion and a foreshadow- 
ing of the prophetic work of Jesus in the economy of salvation, 
in a third name closely akin to the former. Hoshea, which we 
know in our English Bible as Hosea, was the original name of 
Joshua (compare Rom. ix. 25, Rey.) and means saving. He is, in 
a peculiar sense, the prophet of grace and salvation, placing his 
hope in God’s personal coming as the refuge and strength of 
humanity ; in the purification of human life by its contact with 
the divine. The great truth which he has to teach is the love 
of Jehovah to Israel as expressed in the relation of husband, 
an idea which pervades his prophecy, and which is generated 
by his own sad domestic experience. He foreshadows Jesus in 
his pointed warnings against sin, his repeated offers of divine 
mercy, and his patient, forbearing love, as manifested in his 


dealing with an unfaithful and dissolute wife, whose soul he 
2 


18 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu L 


succeeded in rescuing from sin and death (Hosea i.-iii.). So 
long as he lived, he was one continual, living prophecy of the 
tenderness of God toward sinners; a picture of God’s love for 
us when alien from him, and with nothing in us to love. The 
faithfulness of the prophetic teacher thus blends in Hosea, as 
in our Lord, with the compassion and sympathy and sacrifice 
of the priest. 


He (airds). Emphatic; and so rightly in Rev., “ For 7s He 
that shall save his people.” 


Their sins (duaptidv). Akin to duaprdva, to miss a mark ; 
as a warrior who throws his spear and fails to strike his adver- 
sary, or as a traveller who misses his way.* In this word, there- 
fore, one of a large group which represent sin under different 
phases, sin is conceived as a failing and missing the true end 
and scope of our lives, which is God. 


22. Through the prophet (6a). So the Rev. rightly, in- 
stead of by. In quotations from the Old Testament, the writers 
habitually use the preposition dca (through) to denote the instru- 
mentality through which God works or speaks, while they re- 
serve v7rd (by) to express the primary agency of God himself. 
So here the prophecy in ver. 23 was spoken by the Lord, but was 
communicated to men through his prophet. 

23. The virgin (% map9évos). Note the demonstrative force 
of the article, pointing to a particular person. Not, some virgin 
or other. 


They shall call (cadécovow.) In ver. 21, it is thou shalt call. 
The original of Isaiah (vii. 14) has she shall call ; but Matthew 
generalizes the singular into the plural, and quotes the prophecy 
in a form suited to its larger and final fulfilment: men shall call 
his name Immanuel, as they shall come to the practical knowl- 
edge that God will indeed dwell with men upon the earth. 

Immanuel (Hebrew, Godzs with us). To protect and save. A 
comment is furnished by Isa. viii. 10, “ Devise a device, but it 
shall come to naught ; speak a word, but it shall not stand, for 





* See Homer, ‘‘ Iliad,” ix., 501 ; Sophocles, ‘‘ Oedipus Tyrannus,” 621.

with us 1s God.” Some suppose that Isaiah embodied the pur- 
port of his message in the names of his children: Maher- 
shalal-hash-baz (speed-prey), a warning of the coming of the 
fierce Assyrians; Shear-Jashub (a remnant shall return), a re- 
minder of God’s mercy to Israel in captivity, and Zmmanuel 
(God is with us), a promise of God’s presence and succor. How- 
ever this may be, the promise of the name is fulfilled in Jesus 
(compare “ Lo, lam with you alway,” Matt. xxviii. 20) by his 
helpful and saving presence with his people in their sorrow, 
their conflict with sin, and their struggle with death.’ 

24. The or his sleep (rod drvov). The force of the defi- 
nite article; the sleep in which he had the vision. So Rev., 
“ Arose from his sleep.” 


CHAR THR ALL. 


1. Bethlehem. Hebrew, House of Bread, probably from 
its fertility. The birthplace of him who calls himself the Bread 
of Infe (John vi. 35), and identified with the history of his 
human ancestry through Ruth, who was here married to Boaz, 
and was the ancestress of David (i. 5, 6), and through David 
himself, who was born there, and anointed king by Samuel (com- 


pare Luke ii. 11, city of David). 


Wise men, or Magi (wdyo). Wycliffe renders kings. A 
priestly caste among the Persians and Medes, which occupied 
itself principally with the secrets of nature, astrology, and 
medicine. Daniel became president of such an order in Baby- 
lon (Dan. ii. 48). The word became transferred, without dis- 
tinction of country, to all who had devoted themselves to those 
sciences, which were, however, frequently accompanied with 
the practice of magic and jugglery ; and, under the form magz- 
cian, it has come to be naturalized in many of the languages of 
Europe. Many absurd traditions and guesses respecting these 
visitors to our Lord’s cradle have found their way into popular 
belief and into Christian art. They were said to be kings, and 


20 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. IL 


three in number; they were said to be representatives of the 
three families of Shem, Ham, and Japhet, and therefore one of 
them is pictured as an Ethiopian; their names are given as 
Caspar, Balthasar, and Melchior, and their three skulls, said to 
have been discovered in the twelfth century by Bishop Reinald 
of Cologne, are exhibited in a priceless casket in the great 
cathedral of that city. 


9. The east (avaton}). Literally, the msing. Some com- 
mentators prefer to render at its rising, or when it rose. In 
Luke i. 78, the word is translated dayspring, or dawn. The 
kindred verb occurs in Matt. iv. 16, “light did spring up” 
(avéreurer). 


4. All the chief priests. Weshould expect only one chief 
priest to be mentioned ; but the office had become a lucrative 
one, and frequently changed hands. A rabbi is quoted as say- 
ing that the first temple, which stood about four hundred and 
ten years, had only eighteen high-priests from first to last; 
while the second temple, which stood four hundred and twenty 
years, had more than three hundred high-priests. The refer- 
ence here is not to a meeting of the Sanhedrim, since the elders, 
who are not mentioned, belonged to this; but to an extraordi- 
nary convocation of all the high-priests and learned men. Be- 
sides the high-priest in actual office, there might be others who 
had been his predecessors, and who continued to bear the name, 
and in part the dignity. It may possibly have included the 
heads of the twenty-four courses of priests. 


6. Land of Judah. To distinguish it from Bethlehem in 
the territory. of Zebulon. 


Shall be shepherd of (sro.pavet), from rrouuny, a shepherd. 
So Reyv., rightly, instead of shall rule. The word involves the 
whole office of the shepherd—guiding, guarding, folding, as 
well as feeding. Hence appropriate and often applied to the 
guides and guardians of others. Homer calls kings “ the shep- 
herds of the people.” To David the people said, “The Lord 


Cu. IL.) MATYHEW. 21 


said to thee, Thou shalt, feed (as a shepherd) my people Israel” 
(2 Sam. v. 2; compare Ps. lxxviii. 7 0-72). God is often called 
a shepherd (Gen. xlviii. 15 ; Pg, xxii. 1; lxxvii. 20; Ixxx. 1; 
Isa. xl. 11; Ezek. xxxiv. 11-31). Jesus calls himself the good 
shepherd (John x. 11). Peter, who is bidden by Jesus to shep- 
herd his sheep (John xxi. 16, wo/pawe, Rev., tend), calls him the 
Shepherd of Souls (1 Pet. ii. 25), and the Chief Shepherd (1 
Pet. v. 4); and in the Epistle to the Hebrews (xiii. 20), he is — 
styled the great Shepherd of the sheep. In Apoe. ii. 27, rule is 
literally to shepherd (compare xix. 15); but Christ will shep- 
herd his enemies, not with the pastoral crook, but with a sceptre 
of iron. Finally, Jesus will perpetuate this name and office in 
heaven among his redeemed ones, for “the Zamb, which isin the 
midst of the throne, shall be their shepherd (Apoe. vii. 17, Rey.). 
In this verse the word governor is in harmony with the idea of 
shepherding, since the word Hryoupevos originally means one 
who goes before, or leads the way, and suggests Christ’s words 
about the good shepherd in John x. 3, 4: “ He calleth his own 
sheep by name, and leadeth them out. . . . He goeth 
before them, and the sheep follow him.” 


Inquired diligently (jxp/Bacev). Better learned accurately. 
The verb is formed from dxpos, at the point or end. The idea 
is, therefore, he ascertained to the last point ; denoting the ex- 
actness of the information rather than the diligence of the 
search for it. Compare ver. 8, “Search out carefully” (axpe- 
Bas). So the Rev. for diligently. 


What time the star appeared (Tov xpévov Tod atvopévou 
aortépos). Lit., the time of the appearing star. Herod asks, 
“ How long does the star make itself visible since its resing in 
the East ? rather than “At what time did wt appear he 


12. Being warned (ypnyatiaJévres). The verb means fo 
give a response to one who asks or consults : hence, in the pas- 
sive, as here, to recewe an answer. The word therefore implies 
that the wise men had sought counsel of God; and so Wycliffe, 
“ And answer taken in sleep.”

16. The children (rovs zraidas). Male children, as is indi-

23. The prophets. Note the plural, as indicating not any 
one prediction in particular, but a summary of the import of 
several prophetic statements, such as Ps. xxii, 6, 8; lxix. 11, 
19; Isa. liii. 2, 3, 4. 


A Nazarene. A term of contempt (compare John i. 46, and 
vii. 52). The very name of Nazareth suggested insignificance. 
In Hebrew it meant sprout or shoot. The name is prophetically 
given to the Messiah (Isa. xi.1). In Isa. x. 33, 34, the fate of 
Assyria is described under the figure of the felling of a cedar- 
forest. The figure of the tree is continued at the opening of 
ch. xi. concerning the Jewish state. The cedar throws out no 
fresh suckers, but the oak is a tree “in which, after the felling, 
a stock remaineth ” (Isa. vi. 13 ; compare Job xiv. 9). There isa 
future then for Israel, represented by the oak. “There shall 
come forth a shoot from the stock of Jesse, and a twig from 
his roots shall bear fruit.” As David sprang from the humble 
family of Jesse, so the Messiah, the second David, shall arise 
out of great humiliation. The fact that Jesus grew up at Naz- 
areth was sufficient reason for his being despised. He was not 
a lofty branch on the summit of a stately tree; not a recog- 
nized and honored son of the royal house of David, now fallen, 
but an insignificant sprout from the roots of J esse ; a Nazarene, 
of an upstart sprout-town.

1. In those days. The phrase is indefinite, but always 
points back to a preceding date ; in this case to the date of the 
settlement of the family at Nazareth. ‘In those days,” 2.¢., 
some time during the nearly thirty years since that settlement. 


John. Hebrew, meaning God has dealt graciously. Compare 
the German Gotthold. 


Cu. III.) MATTHEW. 23 


Came (saparyiverat). Rev., cometh. The verb is used in 
what is called the historical present, giving vividness to the nar- 
rative, as Carlyle (“ French Revolution”): “ But now also the 
National Deputies from all ends of France are in Paris with 
their commissions.” ‘ In those days appears John the Baptist.” 


Preaching (xnpvcowv). See on 2 Pet. ii. 5. 


Wilderness (77 épyjuw). Not suggesting absolute barrenness 
but unappropriated territory affording free range for shepherds 
and their flocks.. Hepworth Dixon (“The Holy Land ”) says, 
“Even in the wilderness nature is not so stern as man. Here 
and there, in clefts and basins, and on the hillsides, grade on 
grade, you observe a patch of corn, a clump of olives, a single 
palm.” 


2. Repent (ueravoeire). A word compounded of the preposi- 
tion peta, after, with ; and the verb voéw, to percewe, and to 
think, as the result of perceiving or observing. In this com- 
pound the preposition combines the two meanings of time and 
change, which may be denoted by after and different ; so that 
the whole compound means to think differently after. Mera- 
voua (repentance) is therefore, primarily, an after-thought, 
different from the former thought; then, a change of mind 
which issues in regret and in change of conduct. These latter 
ideas, however, have been imported into the word by scriptural 
usage, and do not lie in it etymologically nor by primary usage. 
Lepentance, then, has been rightly defined as “‘ Such a virtuous 
alteration of the mind and purpose as begets a like virtuous 
change in the life and practice.” Sorrow is not, as is popularly 
conceived, the primary nor the prominent notion of the word. 
Paul distinguishes between sorrow (Av) and repentance (peTa- 
vova), and puts the one as the outcome of the other. ‘Godly 
sorrow worketh repentance” (2 Cor. vii. 10). 


The kingdom of heaven. Lit., the kingdom of the heavens 
(7 Bactheia Tov ovpavev). An expression peculiar to Matthew. 
The more usual one is the kingdom of God. It is a kingdom 


24 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. TIL 


of heaven because its origin, its end, its king, the character and 
destiny of its subjects, its laws, institutions, and privileges—all 
are heavenly. In the teaching of Christ and in the apostolic 
writings the kingdom of the Messiah is the actual consumma- 
tion of the prophetic idea of the rule of God, without any 
national limitation, so that participation therein rests only on 
faith in Jesus Christ, and on the moral renewal which is condi- 
tioned by the same. It is the combination of all rights of 
Christian citizenship in this world, and eternal blessedness in 
the next. All its senses are only different sides of the same 
great idea—the subjection of all things to God in Christ. 


Voice. John’s personality is thrown into shadow behind 
Christ. ‘‘ What would be the duty of a merely human teacha 
of the highest moral aim, entrusted with a great spiritual mis- 
sion and lesson for the benefit of mankind? The example of 
St. John Baptist is an answer to this inquiry. Such a teacher 
would represent himself as a mere ‘voice,’ crying aloud in the 
moral wilderness around him, and anxious, beyond aught else, 
to shroud his own insignificant person beneath the majesty of 
his message” (Liddon, ‘‘ Our Lord’s Divinity ”). 


6. Were baptized (€Bamrifovro). See on Mark vii. 4. 


Confessing their sins (€£ouoroyouuevor Tas duaptias avTar). 
The words imply: 1. That confession was connected with bap- 
tism. They were baptized whale im the act of confessing. 2. 
An open confession, not a private one to John (é&, compare 
Acts xix. 18 ; Jas. v.16). 8. An mdwidual confession ; possi- 
bly a specific one. (See Luke iii. 10-15.) 


9. These stones. Pointing, as he spoke, to the pebbles on 
the beach of the Jordan. 


10. Is laid (xetras). Not, ts applied, as “She layeth her 
hands to the spindle ” (Prov. xxxi. 19), but zs dying. 


Is hewn down and cast. The present tense is graphic, denot 
iag what is to happen at once and certainly. 


Cu. IIL] MATTHEW. D5 


11. To bear. Compare to wnloose, Mark i.7. John puts him- 
self in the position of the meanest of servants. To dear the san- 
dals of their masters, that is, to bring and take them away, as 
well as to fasten or to take them off, was, among the Jews, 
Greeks, and Romans, the business of slaves of the lowest rank. 


12. Fan, floor (Wye. has corn-floor). The picture is of a 
farmer at his threshing-floor, the area of hard-beaten earth on 
which the sheaves are spread and the grain trodden out by 
animals. His fan, that is his winnowing-shovel or fork, is in his 
hand, and with it he throws up the mingled wheat and chaff 
against the wind in order to separate the grain.* 

Throughly cleanse (S:axaSapeci). 77 hroughly (retained by 
Rey.) obsolete form of thoroughly, is the force of the preposi- 
tion Sia (through). In that preposition lies the picture of the 
farmer beginning at one side of the floor, and working through 
to the other, cleansing as he goes. 

The whole metaphor represents the Messiah as separating 
the evil from the good, according to the tests of his kingdom 
and Gospel, receiving the worthy into his kingdom and con- 
signing the unworthy to destruction (compare Matt. xiii. 30; 
39-43 ; 48-50). 


14. Forbad (Suexodvev). The A. V., following Wye. and 
Tynd., misses the meaning of the verb. As in so many in- 
stances, it overlooks the force of the imperfect tense, which ex- 
presses past action, either in progress or in process of concep- 
tion, in the agent’s mind. John did not forbid Jesus, but had 
it in mind to prevent him: was for hindering him. Hence 
Rev., properly, would have hindered him. Again, the prepo- 
sition (8d) intensifies the verb, and represents strong feeling on 
John’s part. He was moved to strenuous protest against Jesus’ 
baptism by him. 


16. As a dove (dae) mepictepdv). In the form of a dove, and 
not, as some interpret, referring merely to the manner of the 
descent—swiftly and gently as a dove (compare Luke iii. 22 “ Jn 





- Ficor, &wva, properly a circular space. Used also of the disk of the sun 
or moon, or of & halo, which is a transcript of the Greek word. 


26 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cx. ILI. 


a bodily form, as a dove”). The dove was an ancient symbol 
of purity and innocence, adopted by our Lord in Matt. x. 16. 
It was the only bird allowed to be offered in sacrifice by the 
Levitical law. In Christian art it is the symbol of the Holy 
Spirit, and that in his Old Testament manifestations as well as 
in those of the New Testament. From a very early date the 
dove brooding over the waters was the type of the opening 
words of Genesis. An odd fresco on the choir-walls of the 
Cathedral of Monreale, near Palermo, represents a waste of 
waters, and Christ above, leaning forward from the circle of 
heaven with extended arms. From beneath him issues the 
divine ray along which the dove is descending upon the waters. 


So Milton: 
“‘Thou from the first 
Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread 
Dove-like sat’st brooding on the vast abyss 
And mad’st it pregnant.” 


In art, the double-headed dove is the peculiar attribute of the 
prophet Elisha. .A window in Lincoln College, Oxford, repre- 
sents him with the double-headed dove perched upon his 
shoulder. The symbol is explained by Elisha’s prayer that a 
double portion of Elijah’s spirz¢ might rest upon him. 

It has been asserted that, among the Jews, the Holy Spirit 
was presented under the symbol of a dove, and a passage is 
cited from the Talmud: “The Spirit of God moved on the face 
of the waters like a dove.” Dr. Edersheim (“Life and Times 
of Jesus the Messiah”) vigorously contradicts this, and says 
that the passage treats of the supposed distance between the 
upper and the lower waters, which was only three finger- 
breadths. This is proved by Gen. i. 2, where the Spirit of God 
is said to brood over the face of the waters, “Just as a dove 
broodeth over her young without touching them.” “Thus the 
comparison is not between the Spirit and the dove, but between 
the closeness with which a dove broods over her young without 
touching them, and the supposed proximity of the Spirit to the 
lower waters without touching them.” He goes on to say that 
the dove was not the symbol of the Holy Spirit, but of Israel. 
“Tf, therefore, rabbinic illustration of the descent of the Holy 


Cu. IV.] MATTHEW. OT 


Spirit with the visible appearance of a dove must be sought for, 
it would lie in the acknowledgment of Jesus as the ideal typical 
Israelite, the representative of his people.” 


CHAPTER IV. 


1. The Devil (rod dia8orov). The word means calumniator, 
slanderer. It is sometimes applied to men, as to Judas (John vi. 
70); in 1 Tim. iii. 11 (slanderers) ; and in 2 Tim. ili. 3, and Tit. ii. 
3 (false accusers). In such cases never with the article. Zhe 
Devil, Satan, the god of this world (6 dudBodos), is always with 
the article and never plural. This should be distinguished from 
another word, also wrongly rendered devil in the A. V.— 
daiuav, and its more common neuter form datpovov, both of 
which should be translated demon, meaning the unclean spir- 
its which possessed men, and were cast out by Christ and his 
apostles. The Rev., unfortunately, and against the protest of 
the American revisers, retains devil for both words, except in 
Acts xvii. 18, where it renders as A. V. gods. 


The Son of God. By its position in the sentence Son is em- 
phatic. “If thou standest to God in the relation of Son.” 


Bread (dprou). Lit., loaves or cakes. So Wye., loaves. These 
stones were perhaps those “ silicious accretions,” which assume 
the exact shape of little loaves of bread, and which were repre- 
sented in legend as the petrified fruits of the cities of the plain. 
By a similar fancy certain crystallizations on Mount Carmel and 
near Bethlehem are called “ Elijah’s melons,” and the “ Virgin 
Mary’s peas ;” and the black and white stones found along the 
shores of the Lake of Galilee have been transformed into traces 
of the tears of Jacob in search of Joseph. The very appearance 
of these stones, like the bread for which the faint body hun- 
gered, may have added force to the temptation. This resem- 
blance may have been present to Christ’s mind in his words at 
Matt. vii. 9. 


28 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. IV. 


4. It is written (yéypamrrat). The perfect tense. “It has 
been written, and stands written.” The first recorded words of 
Jesus after his entrance upon his ministry are an assertion of 
the authority of scripture, and that though he had the fulness 
of the Spirit. When addressing man, our Lord seldom quoted 
scripture, but said, 7 say unto you. In answer to Satan he says, 
Lt is written. 


5. Taketh (raparapyPaver). The preposition rapd (with, by 
the sede of), implies taketh along with himself, or conducteth. 
It is the same word which all three evangelists use of our Lord’s 
taking his chosen apostles to the Mount of Transfiguration (Matt. 
xvii. 1; Mark ix. 2; Luke ix. 28). 


The holy city. Matthew alone calls Jerusalem by this 
name, in accordance with the general intent of his gospel to con- 
nect the old economy with the new. 


Pinnacle of the temple (70 wreptyiov rot (epod). Pinnacle, 
from the Latin pinnaculdwm, a diminutive of pinna or penna 
(a wing), is a literal translation of arepiyiov, which is also a 
diminutive (a little wing or winglet). Nothing in the word 
compels us to infer that Christ was placed on the top of a tower 
or spire, which is the popular meaning of pinnacle. The word 
may be used in the familiar English sense of the wing of a 
building. Herod’s temple had two wings, the northern and 
southern, of which the southern was the higher and grander ; 
that being the direction in which the chief enlargement of the 
temple area made by Herod was practicable. That enlarge- 
ment, according to Josephus, was effected by building up walls 
of solid masonry from the valley below. At the extremity of 
the southern side of the area, was erected the ‘“ royal portico,” 
a magnificent colonnade, consisting of a nave and two aisles, 
running across the entire space from the eastern to the western 
wall. Josephus further says, that “while the valley of itself 
was very deep, and its bottom could scarcely be seen when one 
looked down from above, the additional vastly high elevation 
of the portico was placed on that height, insomuch that, if any 


Cu. IV.] MATTHEW. 99 


one looked down from the summit of the roof, combining the 
two altitudes in one stretch of vision, he would be giddy, while 
his sight could not reach to such an immense depth.” This, in 
comparison with the northern wing, was so emphatically the 
wing of the temple as to explain the use of the article here, as 
a well-known locality. The scene of the temptation may have 
been (for the whole matter is mainly one of conjecture) the 
roof of this portico, at the southeastern angle, where it joined 
Solomon’s Porch, and from which the view into the Kedron 
valley beneath was to the depth of four hundred and fifty feet. 

The word temple (iepov, lit., saered place) signifies the whole 
compass of the sacred inclosure, with its porticos, courts, and 
other subordinate buildings; and should be carefully distin- 
guished from the other word, vaos, also rendered temple, which 
means the temple itself—the “ Holy Place” and the “ Holy of 
Holies.” When we read, for instance, of Christ teaching in the 
temple (iepdv) we must refer it to one of the temple-porches. 
So it is from the ‘epdv, the court of the Gentiles, that Christ 
expels the money-changers and cattle-merchants. In Matt. 
xxvii. 51, it is the veil of the vaés which is rent; the veil sepa- 
rating the holy place from the holy of holies. In the account 
of Zacharias entering into the temple of the Lord to burn in- 
cense (Luke i. 9), the word is vads, the holy place in which the 
altar of incense stood. The people were “without,” in the fore- 
courts. In John ii. 21, the temple of his body, iepov would be 
obviously inappropriate. 


6. In their hands (él). On their hands (so Rev.) is more 
correct, and gives a different picture from the A. V. in: lifted 
on their hands, as on a litter or platform. 


7. Again (rddw). Emphatic, meaning on the other hand, 
with reference to Satan’s 7¢ is written (ver. 6); as if he had said, 
“the promise which you quote must be explained by another 
passage of scripture.” Archbishop Trench aptly remarks, “ In 
that ‘It is written again’ of Christ, lies a great lesson, quite 
independent of that particular scripture which, on this occasion, 
he quotes, or of the use to which he turns it. There lies in it 


30 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IV. 


the secret of our safety and defence against all distorted use of 
isolated passages in holy scripture. Only as we enter into the 
unity of scripture, as it balances, completes, and explains itself, 
are we warned against error and delusion, excess or defect on 
this side or the other. Thus the retort, ‘J¢ is written again, 
must be of continual application; for indeed what very often 
are heresies but one-sided, exaggerated truths, truths rent away 
indeed from the body and complex of the truth, without the 
balance of the counter-truth, which should have kept them in 
their due place, co-ordinated with other truths or subordinated 
to them ; and so, because all such checks are wanting, not truth 
any more, but error.” 


12. Was cast into prison (srape50.9n). The verb means, 
first, to give, or hand over to another. So, to surrender a city 
or a person, often with the accompanying notion of treachery. 
The Rev., therefore, rightly renders, was delivered up. 


16. The people which sat (6 xaSnuevos) ; Wyc., dwelt. The 
article with the participle (lit., the people, the one sitting) signi- 
fying something characteristic or habitual: the people whose 
characteristic it was to sit in darkness. This thought is em- 
phasized by repetition in a stronger form ; sitting im the region 
and shadow of Death. Death is personified. This land, whose 
inhabitants are spiritually dead, belongs to Death as the realm 
of his government. 


17. To preach (knpiocev). Originally, to discharge the 
duty of a herald (xnpv€); hence to ery out, proclaim (see on 
2 Pet. ii. 5). The standing expression in the New Testament 
for the proclamation of the Gospel; but confined to the pri- 
mary announcement of the message and facts of salvation, and 
not including continuous instruction in the contents and con- 
nections of the message, which is expressed by Suddonew (to 
teach). Both words are used in Matt. iv. 23; ix. 85; xi. 1). 


18. The sea (rv Iéraccav). The small lake of Gennesa- 
ret, only thirteen miles long and six wide in its broadest part, 


Cu. IV.] MATTHEW. 31 


is called the sea, by the same kind of popular usage by which 
Swiss and German lakes are called See; as the Hénzgsee, the 
Trauensee. So, also, in Holland we have the Zuyder Zee. The 
Latin mare (the sea) likewise becomes meer in Holland, and is 
used of a lake, as Haarlemmer Meer; andin England, mere, 
as appears in Windermere, Grasmere, etc. 


A net (auiBrnotpov). From audi, around, and BddXo, to 
throw. Hence the casting-net, which, being cast over the 
shoulder, spreads into a circle (audi). The word is sometimes 
used by classical Greek writers to denote a garment which en- 
compasses the wearer. In ver. 20, the word net again occurs, but 
representing a different Greek word (8¢«7vov) which is the gen- 
eral name for all kinds of nets, whether for taking fish or fowl. 
Still another word occurs at Matt. xiii. 47, cayjvn, the draw- 
net. See farther on that passage. 


21. Mending (caraprifovras). Not necessarily repairing ; 
the word means to adjust, to “put to rights.” It may mean 
here preparing the nets for the next fishing. 


23, 24. Sickness, Disease, Torments, Taken, Lunatic. 
The description of the ailments to which our Lord’s power was 
applied gains in vividness by study of the words in detail. In ver. 
23, the Rev. rightly transposes sickness and disease; for vocos 
(A. V., sickness) carries the notion of something severe, dan- 
gerous, and even violent (compare the Latin noceo, to hurt, to 
which the root is akin). Homer always represents vdcos as the 
visitation of an angry deity. Hence used of the plague which 
Apollo sent upon the Greeks (‘“Tliad,” i. 10). So Sophocles 
(“ Antigone,” 421) calls a whirlwind Jelav vécov (a divine visita- 
tion). Disease is, therefore, the more correct rendering as ex- 
pressing something stronger than sickness or debility. Sich- 
ness, however, suits the other word, wadaxiav. The kindred 
adjective, wadaxes, means soft, as a couch or newly-ploughed 
furrow, and thus easily runs into our invidious moral sense of 
softness, namely, effeminacy or cowardice, and into the physical 


32 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IV. 


sense of weakness, sickness. Hence the word emphasizes the 
idea of debility rather than of violent suffering or danger. 

In ver. 24 we have, first, a general expression for ailments of 
all kinds: add that were sick (lit., all who had themselves in evil 
case ; wdvtas Tovs KaKas éxovtas). Then the idea of suffering 
is emphasized in the word taken (cvveyopévovs), which means 
literally Aeld-together or compressed ; and so the Rev. holden 
is an improvement on taken, in which the A. V. has followed 
Wye. and Tyn. The word is used of the multitude thronging 
Christ (Luke viii. 45). Compare, also, “how am I straitened 
(Luke xii. 50); and I amin a strait (Philip i. 23). Then fol- 
low the specific forms of suffering, the list headed again by 
the inclusive word vdcois, diseases, and the «cal following hav- 
ing the force of and particularly. Note the word torments 
(Bacdvos). Bdcavos originally meant the “ Lydian stone,” or 
touchstone, on which pure gold, when rubbed, leaves a peculiar 
mark. Hence, naturally, a ¢est ; then a test or trial by torture. 
“ Most words,” says Professor Campbell (‘‘ On the Language of 
Sophocles ”) “‘have been originally metaphors, and metaphors 
are continually falling into the rank of words,” used by the 
writer as mere vehicles of expression without any sense of 
the picturesque or metaphorical element at theircore. Thus the 
idea of a test gradually passes entirely out of Bdcavos, leaving 
merely the idea of suffering or torture. This is peculiarly 
noticeable in the use of this word and its derivatives through- 
out the New Testament ; for although suffering as a test is a 
familiar New Testament truth, these words invariably express 
simply torment or pain. Wycliffe renders, “They offered to 
him all men having evil, taken with divers sorrows and tor- 
ments;” and Tyndale, “ All sick people that were taken with 
divers diseases and gripings.” Lwnatic, or moon-struck, 
(ceAnviafomévous), is rendered by Rev. epileptic, with reference 
to the real or supposed influence of the changes of the moon 
upon the victims of epilepsy. 


Cu. V.] MATTHEW. 3d 


CHAPTER YV. 


1. A mountain (7d épos). The Rev. recognizes the force of 
the definite article, and renders “ ¢he mountain,” that particular 
mountain in the place where Jesus saw the multitudes. The 
mountain itself cannot be identified. Delitzsch calls the Mount 
of Beatitudes “ The Sinai of the New Testament.” 


When he was set («a9icavros), following Tyndale. Rev., 
more literally, when he had sat down (compare Wye., when he 
had sete). After the manner of the rabbis, he seated himself 
ere he began to teach. 


2. Taught (édéacxev). The imperfect signifies began to 
teach. 


3. Blessed (waxdpiot). As this word and its cognates occur 
at least fifty-five times in the New Testament, it is important 
to understand its history, which is interesting because it is one 
of those numerous words which exhibit the influence of Chris- 
tian association and usage in enlarging and dignifying their 
meaning. It is commonly rendered blessed, both in the A. V. 
and Rev., and that rendering might properly be given it in 
every instance. 

Its root is supposed to be a word meaning great, and its 
earlier meaning appears to be limited to outward prosperity ; 
so that it is used at times as synonymous with ch. It scarcely 
varies from this meaning in its frequent applications to the 
Grecian gods, since the popular Greek ideal of divine blessed- 
ness was not essentially moral. The gods were blessed because 
of their power and dignity, not because of their holiness. ‘“ In 
general,” says Mr. Gladstone (“ Homer and the Homeric Age”) 
“ the chief note of deity with Homer is emancipation from the 
restraints of moral law. Though the Homeric gods have not 
yet ceased to be the vindicators of morality upon earth, they 
have personally ceased to observe its rules, either for or among 

3 


34 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. V. 


themselves. As compared with men, in conduct they are gen- 
erally characterized by superior force and intellect, but by infe- 
rior morality.” 

In its peculiar application to the dead, there is indicated the 
despair of earthly happiness underlying the thought of even 
the cheerful and mercurial Greek. Hence the word was used 
as synonymous with dead. Only the dead could be called truly 
blessed. Thus Sophocles (“ Cidipus Tyrannus”) : 


‘¢ From hence the lesson learn ye 
To reckon no man happy till ye witness 
The closing day ; until he pass the border 
Which severs life from death, unscathed by sorrow.” 


And again (“ Gidipus at Colonus ”) : 


‘‘ Happiest beyond compare, 
Never to taste of life : 
Happiest in order next, 
Being born, with quickest speed 
Thither again to turn 
From whence we came.” 


Nevertheless, even in its pagan use, the word was not alto- 
gether without a moral background. The Greeks recognized a 
prosperity which waited on the observance of the laws of natu- 
ral morality, and an avenging Fate which pursued and punished 
their violation. This conception appears often in the works of 
the tragedians ; for instance, in the “(idipus Tyrannus” of 
Sophocles, where the main motive is the judgment which waits 
upon even unwitting violations of natural ties. Still, this 
prosperity is external, consisting either in wealth, or power, or 
exemption from calamity. 

With the philosophers a moral element comes definitely into 
the word. ‘The conception rises from outward propriety to in- 
ward correctness as the essence of happiness. But in all of 
them, from Socrates onward, virtue depends primarily upon 
knowledge ; so that to be happy is, first of all, to know. It is 
thus apparent that the Greek philosophy had no conception of 
sim in the Bible sense. As virtue depended on knowledge, sin 
was the outcome of ignorance, and virtue and its consequent 


Cu. V.] MATTHEW. 35 


happiness were therefore the prerogative of the fewand the 
learned. 

The biblical use of the word lifted it into the region of the 
spiritual, as distinguished from the merely intellectual, and be- 
sides, intrusted to it alone the task of representing this higher 
conception. The pagan word for happiness (evda.povia, under 
the protection of a good genius or daemon) nowhere occurs in 
the New Testament nor in the Scriptures, having fallen into 
disrepute because the word daemon, which originally meant a 
deity, good or evil, had acquired among the Jews the bad sense 
which we attach to demon. Happiness, or better, blessedness, 
was therefore represented both in the Old and in the New Testa- 
ment by this word paxdpws. In the Old Testament the idea 
involves more of outward prosperity than in the New Testa- 
ment, yet it almost universally occurs in connections which 
emphasize, as its principal element, a sense of God’s approval 
founded in righteousness which rests ultimately on love to God. 

Thus the word passed up into the higher region of Christian 
thought, and was stamped with the gospel signet, and laden 
with all the rich significance of gospel blessedness. It now 
takes on a group of ideas strange to the best pagan morality, 
and contradictory of its fundamental positions. Shaking itself 
loose from all thoughts of outward good, it becomes the express 
symbol of a happiness identified with pure character. Behind it 
lies the clear cognition of sin as the fountain-head of all misery, 
and of holiness as the final and effectual cure for every woe. 
For knowledge as the basis of virtue, and therefore of happi- 
ness, it substitutes faith and love. For the aristocracy of the 
learned virtuous, it introduces the truth of the Fatherhood of 
God and the corollary of the family of believers. While the 
pagan word carries the isolation of the virtuous and the con- 
traction of human sympathy, the Gospel pushes these out with 
an ideal of a world-wide sympathy and of a happiness realized 
in ministry. The vague outlines of an abstract good vanish 
from it, and give place to the pure heart’s vision of God, and 
its personal communion with the Father in heaven. Where it 
told of the Stoic’s self-sufficiency, it now tells of the Christian’s 
poverty of spirit and meekness. Where it hinted at the Stoic’s 


36 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. V. 


self-repression and strangling of emotion, it now throbs with a 
holy sensitiveness, and with a monition to rejoice with them 
that rejoice, and to weep with them that weep. From the 
pagan word the flavor of immortality is absent. No vision of 
abiding rest imparts patience and courage amid the bitterness 
and struggle of life; no menace of the destiny of evil imposes 
a check on human lusts. The Christian word ddessed is full of 
the light of heaven. It sternly throws away from itself every 
hint of the Stoic’s asserted right of suicide as a refuge from 
human ills, and emphasizes something which thrives on trial 
and persecution, which glories in tribulation, which not only 
endures but conquers the world, and expects its crown in heaven. 


The poor (oi 7rwyol). Three words expressing poverty are 
found in the New Testament. Two of them, wévys and 7zrev- 
xpos, are kindred terms, the latter being merely a poetic form 
of the other, and neither of these occurs more than once (Luke 
xxi. 2; 2 Cor. ix. 9). The word used in this verse is therefore 
the current word for poor, occurring thirty-four times, and cov- 
ering every gradation of want; so that it is evident that the 
New Testament writers did not recognize any nice distinctions 
of meaning which called for the use of other terms. Luke, for 
instance (xxi. 2, 3), calls the widow who bestowed her two 
mites both arevypav and mtwy7). Nevertheless, there is a dis- 
tinction, recognized by both classical and ecclesiastical writers. 
While o zévys is one of narrow means, one who “ earns a scanty 
pittance,” wTwyos is allied to the verb rrdéocew, to crouch or 
cringe, and therefore conveys the idea of wdéter destitution, 
which abjectly solicits and lives by alms. Hence it is applied 
to Lazarus (Luke xvi. 20, 22), and rendered beggar. Thus dis- 
tinguished, it is very graphic and appropriate here, as denoting 
the utter spiritual destitution, the consciousness of which pre- 
cedes the entrance into the kingdom of God, and which cannot 
be relieved by one’s own efforts, but only by the free mercy of 
God. (See on 2 Cor. vi. 103; viii. 9.) 


4. They that mourn (ev9obvtes). Signifying grief mani- 
ested; too deep for concealment. Hence it is often joined with 
Kralew, to weep audibly (Mark xvi. 10; James iv. 9). 


Cu. V.) MATTHEW. 37 


Shall be comforted. See on John xiv. 16. 


5. The meek (oi zpaets). Another word which, though never 
used in a bad sense, Christianity has lifted to a higher plane, 
and made the symbol of a higher good. Its primary meaning 
is mild, gentle. It was applied to inanimate things, as light, 
wind, sound, sickness. It was used of a horse ; gentle. 

As a human attribute, Aristotle defines it as the mean between 
stubborn anger and that negativeness of character which is in- 
capable of even righteous indignation : according to which it is 
tantamount to eguanimity. Plato opposes it to fierceness or 
cruelty, and uses it of humanity to the condemned ; but also of 
the conciliatory demeanor of a demagogue seeking popularity 
and power. Pindar applies it to a king, med or kind to the 
citizens, and Herodotus uses it as opposed to anger. 

These pre-Christian meanings of the word exhibit two general 
characteristics. 1. They express outward conduct merely. 2. 
They contemplate relations to men only. The Christian word, 
on the contrary, describes an inward quality, and that as re- 
lated primarily to God. The equanimity, mildness, kindness, 
represented by the classical word, are founded in self-control or 
in natural disposition. The Christian meekness is based on 
humility, which is not a natural quality but an outgrowth of a 
renewed nature. To the pagan the word often implied conde- 
scension, to the Christian it implies submission. The Chris- 
tian quality, in its manifestation, reveals all that was best in the 
heathen virtue—mildness, gentleness, equanimity—but these 
manifestations toward men are emphasized as outgrowths of a 
spiritual relation to God. The mildness or kindness of Plato 
or Pindar imply no sense of inferiority in those who exhibit 
them ; sometimes the contrary. Plato’s demagogue is kindly 
from self-interest and as a means to tyranny. Pindar’s king is 
condescendingly kind. The meekness of the Christian springs 
from a sense of the inferiority of the creature to the Creator, 
and especially of the sinful creature to the holy God. While, 
therefore, the pagan quality is redolent of sef-assertion, the 
Christian quality carries the flavor of sef-abasement. As to- 
ward God, therefore, meekness accepts his dealings without 


38 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. V. 


murmur or resistance as absolutely good and wise. As toward 
man, it accepts opposition, insult, and provocation, as God’s per- 
mitted ministers of a chastening demanded by the infirmity and 
corruption of sin; while, under this sense of his own sinfulness, 
the meek bears patiently “the contradiction of sinners against 
himself,” forgiving and restoring the erring in a spirit of meek- 
ness, considering himself, lest he also be tempted (see Gal. vi. 
1-5). The ideas of forgiveness and restoration nowhere attach 
to the classical word. They belong exclusively to Christian 
meekness, which thus shows itself allied to love. As ascribed 
by our Lord to himself, see on Matt, xi. 29, Wye. renders 
“ Blessed be m/d men.” 


6. Shall be filled (yopracIjcovta). A very strong and 
graphic word, originally applied to the feeding and fattening 
of animals in a stall. In Apoc. xix. 21, it is used of the filling 
of the birds with the flesh of God’s enemies. Also of the mul- 
titudes fed with the loaves and fishes (Matt. xiv. 20; Mark viii. 
8; Luke ix. 17). It is manifestly appropriate here as express- 
ing the complete satisfaction of spiritual hunger and thirst. 
Hence Wycliffe’s rendering, fuljilled, is strictly true to the orig- 
inal. 


7. The merciful. See on Luke i. 50. 


9. The peacemakers (0: eipnvo7roio/). Should be held to 
its literal meaning, peace-makers ; not as Wyc., peaceable men. 
The founders and promoters of peace are meant ; who not only 
keep the peace, but seek to bring men into harmony with each 
other. Tynd. renders, the maintainers of peace. 


13. Have lost his savour (uwpavd7). The kindred noun 
(uwpos) means dull, sluggish ; applied to the mind, stupid or 
silly ; applied to the taste, insipid, flat. The verb here used 
of salt, to become insipid, also means to play the fool. Our 
Lord refers here to the familiar fact of salt losing its pungency 
and becoming useless. Dr. Thompson (“The Land and the 
Book”) cites the following case: “ A merchant of Sidon, having 


Cu. V.] MATTHEW. 39 


farmed of the government the revenue from the importation of 
salt, brought over a great quantity from the marshes of Cyprus 
—enough, in fact, to supply the whole province for many years. 
This he had transferred to the mountains, to cheat the govern- 
ment out of some small percentage of duty. Sixty-five houses 
were rented and filled with salt. Such houses have merely 
earthen floors, and the salt next the ground was in a few years 
entirely spoiled. I saw large quantities of it literally thrown 
into the road to be trodden under foot of men and beasts. It 
was ‘ good for nothing.’ ” 


15. A bushel (rdv pddiov). Rev., rightly, “the bushel ;” 
since the definite article is designed to indicate a familiar ob- 
ject—the grain-measure which is found in every house. 


A candlestick (rv Xvyviav). Reyv., the stand. Also a part 
of the furniture of every house, and commonly but one in the 
house: hence the article. The word, which occurs four times 
in the Gospels and eight times elsewhere, means, in every case, 
not a candlestick, but a lamp-stand. In Heb. ix. 2, the golden 
“ candlestick” of the tabernacle is called Avyvia; but in the 
description of this article (Exod. xxv. 31, 39), we read, “Thou 
shalt make the seven lamps thereof ;” and in Zech. iv. 2, where 
the imagery is drawn from the sanctuary, we have a “ candle- 
stick ” with a bowl on the top of it, “ and his seven lamps there- 
on, and seven pipes (for the oil) to the lamps which are upon 
the top thereof.” 


16. So shine (otrms). Often misconceived, as if the mean- 
ing were, “ Let your light shine in such a way that men may 
see,” etc. Standing at the beginning of the sentence, it points 
back to the illustration just used. “ So,” even as that lamp just 
mentioned, let your light shine. Wycliffe has apparently 
caught this correct sense: So shine your light before men. 


17. To destroy (xatadicar). Lit., to loosen down, dissolve ; 
Wyc., undo. 


40 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu V. 


18. Jot, tittle (‘é7a, xepaia). Jot is for jod, the smallest let- 
ter in the Hebrew alphabet. ttle is the little bend or point 
which serves to distinguish certain Hebrew letters of similar 
appearance. Jewish tradition mentions the letter jod as being 
irremovable; adding that, if all men in the world were gathered 
to abolish the least letter in the law, they would not succeed. 
The guilt of changing those little hooks which distinguish be- 
tween certain Hebrew letters is declared to be so great that, if 
such a thing were done, the world would be destroyed. 


22. Hell-fire (rv yéevvav tod wrupéds). Rev., more accurately, 
the hell of fire. The word Gehenna, rendered hell, occurs out- 
side of the Gospels only at James iii. 6. It is the Greek repre- 
sentative of the Hebrew Ge-Hinnom, or Valley of Hinnom, a 
deep, narrow glen to the south of Jerusalem, where, after the 
introduction of the worship of the fire-gods by Ahaz, the idola- 
trous Jews sacrificed their children to Molech. Josiah formally 
desecrated it, “that no man might make his son or his daugh- 
ter pass through the fire to Molech ” (2 Kings xxiii. 10). After 
this it became the common refuse-place of the city, into which 
the bodies of criminals, carcasses of animals, and all sorts of 
filth were cast. From its depth and narrowness, and its fire 
and ascending smoke, it became the symbol of the place of the 
future punishment of the wicked. So Milton: 


“The pleasant valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence 
And black Gehenna called, the type of hell.” 


As fire was the characteristic of the place, it was called the 
Gehenna of fire. It should be carefully distinguished from 
Hades (dns), which is never used for the place of punishment, 
but for the place of departed spirits, without reference to their 
moral condition. This distinction, ignored by the A. V., is 
made in the Rey. 


25. Agree with (’a9: edvodv). Lit., be well-minded towards : 
inclined to satisfy by paying or compromising. Wyc., Be thou 
consenting to. 


Cu. V.] MATTHEW. 4l 


Officer (imnpérn). Denoting a subordinate official, as a 
herald or an orderly, and in this sense applied to Mark as the 
“minister” or attendant of Paul and Barnabas (Acts xiii. 5). 
It furnishes an interesting instance of the expansion of a word 
from a limited and special meaning into a more general one; 
and also of the influence of the Gospel in lifting words into 
higher and purer associations. Formed with the verb épécca, 
to row, it originally signified a@ rower, as distinguished from a 
soldier, in a war-galley. This word for a gadley-slave comes at 
last, in the hands of Luke and Paul, to stand for the noblest of 
all offices, that of a minister of the Lord Jesus (Luke i. 2; 
Acts xxvi. 16; 1 Cor. iv. 1). 


29. Offend (cxavdarife). The word offend carries to the 
English reader the sense of giving offence, provoking. Hence 
the Rev., by restoring the picture in the word, restores its true 
meaning, causeth to stumble. The kindred noun is cxavéaror, 
a later form of cxavdddnYpor, the stick in a trap on which the 
bait is placed, and which springs up and shuts the trap at the 
touch of ananimal. Hence, generally, a snare, a stumbling-block. 
Christ’s meaning here is: “If your eye or your hand serve as 
an obstacle or trap to ensnare or make you fall in your moral 
walk.” How the eye might do this may be seen in the pre- 
vious verse. Bengel observes: ‘‘ He who, when his eye proves 
a stumbling-block, takes care not to see, does in reality blind 
himself.” The words scandal and slander are both derived 
from oxdvdanrov ; and Wye. renders, “If thy right eye slander 
thee.” Compare Aischylus, “ Choephori,” 301, 372. 


40. Coat, cloke (yurava, iwdrtiov). The former, the shirt- 
like under-garment or tunic; the latter, the mantle, or ampler 
over-garment, which served as a covering for the night, and 
therefore was forbidden by the Levitical law to be retained in 
pledge over night (Exod. xxii. 26, 27). To yield up this with- 
out resistance therefore implies a higher degree of concession. 


41. Shall compel thee to go (ayyapetce). This word 
throws the whole injunction into a picture which is entirely lost 


4Z WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VL 


to the English reader. A man is travelling, and about to pass 
a post-station, where horses and messengers are kept in order 
to forward royal missives as quickly as possible. An official 
rushes out, seizes him, and forces him to go back and carry 
a letter to the next station, perhaps to the great detriment of 
his business. The word is of Persian origin, and denotes the 
impressment into service, which officials were empowered to 
make of any available persons or beasts on the great lines of 
road where the royal mails were carried by relays of riders. 


42. Borrow (Savicac3ar). Properly, to borrow at interest. 


43. Neighbor (rév wAnciov). Another word to which the 
Gospel has imparted a broader and deeper sense. Literally it 
means the one near (so the Eng., neighbor = nigh-bor), indicat- 
ing a mere outward nearness, proximity. Thus a neighbor 
might be anenemy. Socrates (Plato, “ Republic,” ii., 373) shows 
how two adjoining states might come to want each a piece of 
its neighbor’s (rév wAnoiov) land, so that there would arise war 
between them; and again (Plato, “'Theaetetus,” 174) he says 
that a philosopher is wholly unacquainted with his next-door 
neighbor, and does not know whether he is a man or an animal. 
The Old Testament expands the meaning to cover national or 
tribal fellowship, and that is the sense in our Lord’s quotation 
here. The Christian sense is expounded by Jesus in the para- 
ble of the Good Samaritan (Luke x. 29 sqq.), as including the 
whole brotherhood of man, and as founded in love for man, as 
man, everywhere. 


CHAPTER VI. 


1. Of your Father (apa). The A. V. implies the source of 
the reward; but the preposition means with, by the side of ; so 
that the true sense is, reserved for you and awaiting you by 
the side of your Lather. Rev., rightly, with. 


2. Sound a trumpet (cadzvons). There seems to be no 
trace of any such custom on the part of almsgivers, so that the 


Cu. VI.) MATTHEW. 43 


expression must be taken as a figurative one for making a dis- 
play. It is just possible that the figure may have been sug- 
gested by the “trumpets” of the temple treasury—thirteen 
trumpet-shaped chests to receive the contributions of worship- 
pers. (See on Luke xxi. 2.) 


Have their reward (azéyovow). The preposition azo indi- 
cates receipt in full. Rev. renders they have recewed, so that 
there is nothing more to receive. So Wyc., They have recewed 
their meed. 


6. Closet (rausetov). See on Luke xii. 3. 


7. Use vain repetitions (Bartaroyjonre). A word formed 
in imitation of the sound, battalogein: properly, to stammer ; 
then to babble or prate, to repeat the same formula many times, 
as the worshippers of Baal and of Diana of Ephesus (1 Kings 
xviii. 26; Acts xix. 34) and the Romanists with their pater- 
nosters and aves. 


12. Debts (dderAypara). So, rightly, A. V., and Rev. 
(compare Luke xi. 4). Sin is pictured as a debé, and the sinner 
as a debtor (compare Matt. xviii. 28,30). Accordingly the word 
represents sin both as a wrong and as requiring satisfaction. 
In contrast with the prayer, “Forgive us our debts,” Tholuck 
(“Sermon on the Mount”) quotes the prayer of Apollonius of 
Tyana, “O ye gods, give me the things which are owing to me.” 


Forgive (adyjxapev). Lit., to send away, or dismiss. The 
Rev. rightly gives the force of the past tense, we have for- 
given; since Christ assumes that he who prays for the remis- 
sion of his own debts has already forgiven those indebted to 
him.* 


13. Temptation (cetpacpov). Itis a mistake to define this 
word as only solicitation to evil. It means trial of any kind, 





* The tense is the aorist, denoting completed action at an indefinite past 
time, and so, strictly, forgave ; but where any effect of the action expressed by 
the aorist remains, we are justified in rendering it by a perfect; and so Rev. 


44 WORD STUDIES 1N THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VL 


without reference to its moral quality. Thus, Gen. xxii. 1 
(Sept.), “God did tempt Abraham ;” “ This he said to prove 
him ” (John vi. 6); Paul and Timothy assayed to go to Bithynia 
(Acts xvi. 7); “ Examine yourselves” (2 Cor. xiii. 5). Here, 
generally of all situations and circumstances which furnish an 
occasion for sin. We cannot pray God not to tempt us to sin, 
“for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any 
man” (James i. 18). 


14. Trespasses (zapatt#para). The Lord here uses an- 
other word for sins, and still another (duaptias) appears in 
Luke’s version of the prayer, though he also says, “every one 
that is ¢ndebted to us.” There is no difficulty in supposing that 
Christ, contemplating sins in general, should represent them by 
different terms expressive of different aspects of wrong-doing 
(see on Matt. i. 21). This word is derived from raparrimre, to 
fall or throw one’s self beside. Thus it has a sense somewhat 
akin to dpaptia, of going beside a mark, missing. In classical 
Greek the verb is often used of intentional falling, as of throwing 
one’s self upon an enemy ; and this is the prevailing sense in 
biblical Greek, indicating reckless and wilful sin (see 1 Chron. 
weredrlixsiid.e 2. Chronvixxviy eines 610s Nzekwexiva ia: 
xviii. 26). It does not, therefore, imply palliation or excuse. 
It is a conscious violation of right, involving guilt, and occurs 
therefore, in connection with the mention of forgiveness (Rom. 
iv. 25; v. 16; Col. ii. 18; Eph. ii. 1,5). Unlike wapaBacus 
(transgression), which contemplates merely the objective viola- 
tion of law, it carries the thought of sin as affecting the sinner, 
and hence is found associated with expressions which indicate 
the consequences and the remedy of sin (Rom. iv. 25; v. 15, 
AE pn ais 1) 


16. Ye fast (vnorevnte). Observe the force of the present 
tense as indicating action in progress: Whenever ye may be 


fasting. 


Of a sad countenance (cxv3pw7o). An uncommon word 
in the New Testament, occurring only here and at Luke xxiv. 17. 


Cu. VI.] MATTHEW. A5 


Trench (“Studies in the Gospels”) explains it by the older 
sense of the English dreary, as expressing the downcast look of 
settled grief, pain, or displeasure. In classical Greek it also 
signifies sullenness and affected gravity. Luther renders, Look 
not sour. 


Disfigure (adavifovow). The idea is rather conceal than 
disfigure. There isa play upon this word and gavdow (they 
may appear) which is untranslatable into English: they conceal 
or mask their true visage that they may appear unto men. The 
allusion is to the outward signs of humiliation which often ac- 
companied fasting, such as being unwashed and unshaven and 
unanointed. “ Avoid,” says Christ, “the squalor of the un- 
washed face and of the unkempt hair and beard, and the rather 
anoint thy head and wash thy face, so as to appear (gavijs) 
not unto men, but unto God as fasting.” Wycliffe’s rendering 
is peculiar: They put their faces out of kindly terms. 


19. Lay not up treasures (47) Incavpigere). Lit., treasure 
not treasures. So Wyc., Do not treasure to you treasures. The 
beautiful legend of St. Thomas and Gondoforus is told by Mrs. 
Jameson (‘‘ Sacred and Legendary Art”): ‘“ When St. Thomas 
was at Caesarea, our Lord appeared to him and said, ‘ The king 
of the Indies, Gondoforus, hath sent his provost, Abanes, to seek 
for workmen well versed in the science of architecture, who 
shall build for him a palace finer than that of the Emperor of 
Rome. Behold, nowI will send thee to him. And Thomas 
went, and Gondoforus commanded him to build for him a mag- 
nificent palace, and gave him much gold and silver for the pur- 
pose. The king went into a distant country and was absent for 
two years; and St. Thomas, meanwhile instead of building a 
palace, distributed all the treasures among the poor and sick ; 
and when the king returned he was full of wrath, and he com- 
manded that St. Thomas should be seized and cast into prison, 
and he meditated for him a horrible death. Meantime the 
brother of the king died, and the king resolved to erect for 
him a most magnificent tomb ; but the dead man, after that he 
had been dead four days, suddenly arose and sat upright, and 


46 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Ca. VL 


said to the king, ‘ The man whom thou wouldst torture is a ser- 
vant of God; behold, I have been in Paradise, and the angels 
showed to me a wondrous palace of gold and silver and pre- 
cious stones; and they said, ‘ This is the palace that Thomas, the 
architect, hath built for thy brother, King Gondoforus.’ And 
when the king heard these words, he ran to the prison, and de- 
livered the apostle; and Thomas said to him, ‘ Knowest thou 
not that those who would possess heavenly things have little 
care for the things of this earth? There are in heaven rich 
palaces without number, which were prepared from the begin- 
ning of the world for those who would purchase the possession 
through faith and charity. Thy riches, O king, may prepare 
the way for thee to such a palace, but they cannot follow thee 
thither.’ ” 


Rust (8pacis). That which eats; from the verb BuBpacka, 
to eat. Compare corrode, from the Latin rodo, to gnaw. 


Doth corrupt (addavifer). Rev., conswme. The same word 
which is used above of the hypocrites concealing their faces. 
The rust conswmes, and therefore causes to disappear. So Wyc., 
destroyeth. 


Break through (dvopvccovow). Lit., dig through, as a thief 
might easily penetrate the wall of a common oriental house of 
mud or clay. The Greek name for a burglar is tovywpvyos, a 
wall-digger. Compare Job xxiv. 16, ‘In the dark they dig 
through houses.” Also Ezek. xii. 5. Wyc., Thceves delve out. 


22. Single (adovs). The picture underlying this adjective 
is that of a piece of cloth or other material, neatly folded once, 
and without a variety of complicated folds. Hence the idea of 
simplicity or singleness (compare simplicity from the Latin sim- 
plex ; semel, once ; plicare, to fold). So, in a moral sense, art- 
less, plain, pure. Here sound, as opposed to evil or diseased. 
Possibly with reference to the double-mindedness and indeci- 
sion condemned in ver, 24. 


Cu. VL] MATTHEW. 44 


Full of light (dw7ewov). Bengel says, “As if it were all 
eye.” 


23. In thee—darkness. Seneca, in one of his letters, tells 
of an idiot slave in his house, who had suddenly become blind. 
‘“‘ Now, incredible as the story seems, it is really true that she is 
unconscious of her blindness, and consequently begs her attend- 
ant to go elsewhere because the house is dark. But you may 
be sure that this, at which we laugh in her, happens to us all ; 
no one understands that he is avaricious or covetous. The blind 
seek for a guide ; we wander about without a guide.” 

*“* Seeing falsely is worse than blindness. A man who is too 
dim-sighted to discern the road from the ditch, may feel which 
is which ; but if the ditch appears manifestly to him to be the 
road, and the road to be the ditch, what shall become of him ? 
False seeing is unseeing, on the negative side of blindness” 
(Ruskin, “‘ Modern Painters ”). 


24. The other (érepov). Implying distinction in qualty 
rather than nwmerical distinction (4\Xos). For example, “ who- 
ever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other (rn 
GAnv) ; 7.€., the other one of the two (Matt. v. 39). At Pen- 
tecost, the disciples began to speak with other (érépais) tongues ; 
i.e., different from their native tongues. Here the word gives 
the idea of two masters of distinct or opposite character and in- 
terests, like God and Mammon. 


Hold to (avSééerar). The preposition avri, against, indicates 
holding to the one master as against the other. He who is for 
God must be against Mammon. 


25. Take no thought (4) pepywvare). The cognate noun 
is wépuva, care, which was formerly derived from pepis, a part ; 
pepita, to divide; and was explained accordingly as a dividing 
care, distracting the heart from the true object of life. This 
has been abandoned, however, and the word is placed in a group 
which carries the common notion of earnest thoughtfulness. It 
may include the ideas of worry and ananety, and may empha- 


48 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VIL 


size these, but not necessarily. See, for example, “careth for 
the things of the Lord” (1 Cor. vii. 32). “ That the members 
should have the same care one for another” (1 Cor. xii. 25). 
“Who will care for your state ?” (Phil. ii. 20). In all these the 
sense of worry would be entirely out of place. In other cases 
that idea is prominent, as, “the care of this world,” which 
chokes the good seed (Matt. xiii. 22; compare Luke vill. 14). 
Of Martha; “Thou art careful” (Luke x. 41). Take thought, 
in this passage, was a truthful rendering when the A. V. was 
made, since thought was then used as equivalent to anaety or 
solicitude. So Shakspeare (“Hamlet”) : 


“The native hue of resolution 
Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought.” 


And Bacon (Henry VII.): “ Hawis, an alderman of London, 
was put in trouble, and died with thought and anguish.” 
Somers’ “ Tracts” (in Queen Elizabeth’s reign): “Queen Cath. 
erine Parr died rather of thought.” 

The word has entirely lost this meaning. Bishop Lightfoot 
(“On a Fresh Revision of the New Testament”) says: “ Ihave 
heard of a political economist alleging this passage as an objec- 
tion to the moral teaching of the sermon on the mount, on the 
ground that it encouraged, nay, commanded, a reckless neglect 
of the future.” It is uneasiness and worry about the future 
which our Lord condemns here, and therefore Rev. rightly 
translates be not anvious. This phase of the word is forcibly 
brought out in 1 Peter, v. 7, where the A. V. ignores the dis- 
tinction between the two kinds of care. ‘‘ Casting all your care 
(uépyuvav, Rev., anwiety) upon Him, for He careth (atte pénev) 
for you,” with a fatherly, tender, and provident care.” 


CHAPTER VII. 


3. Beholdest (@rérreus). Staring at from without, as one 
who does not see clearly. 


Considerest (xaravoeis). A stronger word, apprehendest 
Srom within, what is already there. 


Cu. VIL] MATTHEW. ! 49 


Mote (xdpdos). A. V.and Rev. The word mote, however, 
suggests dust ; whereas the figure is that of a minute chp or 
splinter, of the same material with the beam. Wye. renders 
JFestu, with the explanation, a /ittle mote. In explaining the 
passage it is well to remember that the obstruction to sight is 
of the same material in both cases. The man with a great 
beam in his eye, who therefore can see nothing accurately, pro- 
poses to remove the little splinter from his brother’s eye, a 
delicate operation, requiring clear sight. The figure of a splin- 
ter to represent something painful or annoying is a common 
oriental one. Tholuck (“Sermon on the Mount”) quotes from 
the Arabic several passages in point, and one which is literally 
our Lord’s saying: ‘ How seest thou the splinter in thy broth- 
er’s eye, and seest not the cross-beam in thine eye?” 


Beam (éoxov). A log, joist, rafter; indicating a great fault. 


5. See clearly (GuaBrAéeus). The preposition dud, through, 
giving the sense of thoroughness. Compare the simple verb 
Brérrets (beholdest), ver. 3. With the beam in thine eye thou 
starest at thy brother’s little failing. Pull out the beam ; then 
thou shalt see clearly, not only the fault itself, but how to help 
thy brother get rid of it. 


To cast out (€«Bareiv). The Lord’s words assume that the 
object of scrutiny is not only nor mainly detection, but correc- 
tion. Hence thou shalt see clearly, not the mote, but to cast 
out the mote. 


6. That which is holy (ro ayiov). The holy thing, as of some- 
thing commonly recognized as sacred. The reference is to the 
meat offered in sacrifice. The picture is that of a priest throw- 
ing a piece of flesh from the altar of burnt-offering to one of 
the numerous dogs which infest the streets of Eastern cities. 


Pearls before swine (uwapyapitas éumpoodey Tav Yoipwr). 
Another picture of a rich man wantonly throwing handfuls of

half-tamed, the hog being an unclean animal. The wild boar 
haunts the Jordan valley to this day. Small pearls, called by 
jewellers seed-pearls, would resemble the pease or maize on 
which the swine feed. They would rush upon them when 
scattered, and, discovering the cheat, would trample upon them 
and turn their tusks upon the man who scattered them. 


Turn (crpadévtes). The Rev. properly omits again. The 
word graphically pictures the quick, sharp turn of the boar. 


Rend (p7€wouv). Lit., break ; and well chosen to express 
the peculiar character of the wound made by the boar’s tusk, 
which is not a cut, but a long tear or rip. 


9. Bread, a stone (dprov, Xi9ov). Rev. for bread reads loaf, 
which is better. On the resemblance of certain stones to cakes 
of bread, see on Matt. iv. 3. 


13. Strait gate (ctevjs mvAns). Rev., narrow. A remark- 
able parallel to this passage occurs in the “ Pinax” or “ Tablet” 
of Cebes, a writer contemporary with Socrates. In this, human 
life, with its dangers and temptations, is symbolically repre- 
sented as on a tablet. The passage is as follows: “ Seest thou 
not, then, a little door, and a way before the door, which is not 
much crowded, but very few travel it? This is the way which 
leadeth into true culture.” 


Leadeth (amrdyouca). Lit., leadeth away, from death, or, 
perhaps, from the broad road. Note that the gate is not at the 
end, but at the beginning of the road. 


16. Ye shall know (ésruyvécecde). The compound verb in- 
dicates full knowledge. Character is satisfactorily tested by 
its fruits. 


22. Have we not (ov). That form of the negative is used 
which expects an affirmative answer. It therefore pictures 
both the self-conceit and the self-deception of these persons. 
“Surely we have prophesied,” ete. 


Cu. VIL.) MATTHEW. 51 


23. Profess (ouoroynow). The word which is used elsewhere 
of open confession of Christ before men (Matt. x. 32; Rom. x. 
9); of John’s public declaration that he was not the Christ 
(John i. 20); of Herod’s promise to Salome in the presence of 
his guests (Matt. xiv. 7). Here, therefore, of Christ’s open, 
public declaration as Judge of the world. “There is great 
authority in this saying,” remarks Bengel. 


24 sqq. | will liken him, etc. The picture is not of two 
men deliberately selecting foundations, but it contrasts one who 
carefully chooses and prepares his foundation with one who 
builds at hap-hazard. This is more strongly brought ont by 
Luke (vi. 48): “Who digged and went deep, and laid a founda- 
tion upon the rock” (Reyv.). Kitto (“ Pictorial Bible”) says: 
“ At this very day the mode of building in Christ’s own town 
of Nazareth suggests the source of this image. Dr. Robinson 
was entertained in the house of a Greek Arab. The house had 
just been built, and was not yet finished. In order to lay the 
foundations he had dug down to the solid rock, as is usual 
throughout the country here, to the depth of thirty feet, and 
then built up arches.” The abrupt style of ver. 25 pictures the 
sudden coming of the storm which sweeps away the house on 
the sand: “ Descended the rain, and came the floods, and blew 
the winds.” 


27. Great was the fall of it. The conclusion of the Sermon 
on the Mount. “Thus,” remarks Bengel, “it is not necessary 
for every sermon to end with consolation.” 


28. Were astonished (é£emdjccovro). From éx, out of, 
and mAjocw, to strike. Often to drive one out of his senses by 
a sudden shock, and therefore here of amazement. They were 
astounded. We have a similar expression, though not so strong : 
“T was struck with this or that remarkable thing.” 


29. He taught (%v diddcxwv). He was teaching. This 
union of the verb and participle emphasizes the idea of dura- 
tion or habit more than the simple tense. 


52 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Oa. VIIL 


OHAPTER. VILL 


6. Tormented (Bacavifouevos). See on torments, Matt. 
iv. 24. 


7. Heal (Separevow). So A. V. and Rev. The word, how- 
ever, originally means ¢o attend, and to treat medically. The 
centurion uses another and stronger word, shall be healed 
(taSjcerat). Luke, who as a physician is precise in the use of 
medical terms, uses both words in one verse (ix. 11). Jesus 
healed (taro) all who had need of treatment (Separreias). Still, 
Luke himself does not always observe the distinction. See on 
Luke v. 15. 


9. Also («al). Omitted in A. V., but very important. sal 
also am a man under authority,” as well as thou. (Tynd., 
I also myself). The centurion compares the Lord’s position 
with his own. Christ had authority over disease. The centu- 
rion also was in authority over soldiers. As the centurion had 
only to say toa soldier “Go!” and he went, so Christ had only 
to say to disease “Go!” and it would obey him. 


11. Shall sit down (dvaxrIjcovtat). Lit., recline. The pict- 
ure is that of a banquet. Jews as well as Romans reclined at 
table on couches. 


12. The outer (rd é£drepov). The Greek order of words is 
very forcible. “They shall be cast forth into the darkness, 
the outer (darkness). The picture is of an illuminated banquet- 
ing chamber, owts¢de of which is the thick darkness of night. 


13. Was healed (/é9y). Note that the stronger word of the 
centurion (ver. 8) is used here. Where Christ tends, he heals. 


14, Sick of a fever (aupéccovcav). Derived from sip, 
fire. Our word fever comes through the German fewer. 


Cu. VIII.) MATTHEW. 53 


17. Bare (é8doracev). This translation is correct. The 
word does not mean “he took away,” but “he bore,” as a bur- 
den laid upon him. This passage is the corner-stone of the 
faith-cure theory, which claims that the atonement of Christ 
includes provision for bodily no less than for spiritual healing, 
and therefore insists on translating “took away.” Matthew 
may be presumed to have understood the sense of the passage 
he was citing from Isaiah, and he could have used no word 
more inadequate to express his meaning, if that meaning had 
been that Christ took away infirmities. 


20. Holes (dwdecovs). Wye. has ditches, with burrows in ex- 
planation. 


Nests (catacxnveces). Only here and in the parallel, Luke 
ix. 58. Wests is too limited. The word, derived from oKNVN, 
a tent, has the more general meaning of shelter or habitation. 
In classical Greek it is used of an encampment. The nest is 
not to the bird what the hole is to the fox, a permanent dwell- 
ing-place, since the bird frequents the nest only during incuba- 
tion. The Rev. retains nests, but puts lodging-places in the 
margin. 


24. Tempest (cevcpos). Lit., shaking. Used of an earth- 
quake. The narrative indicates a sudden storm. Dr. Thom- 
son (“Land and Book”) says: “Such winds are not only 
violent, but they come down suddenly, and often when the sky 
is perfectly clear. . . . To understand the causes of these 
sudden and violent tempests we must remember that the lake 
lies low—six hundred and eighty feet below the sea; that the 
mountainous plateau of the Jaulin rises to a considerable 
height, spreading backward to the wilds of the Hauran, and 
upward to snowy Hermon; that the water-courses have worn 
or washed out profound ravines and wild gorges, converging to 
the head of this lake; and that these act like great funnels to 
draw down the cold winds from the mountains.” 


28. The tombs (uvnpetwv). Chambers excavated in the 
mountain, which would afford a shelter to the demoniac. 


54 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. ([Cu. VUIL 


Chandler (“‘ Travels in Asia Minor”) describes tombs with two 
square rooms, the lower containing the ashes, while in the 
upper, the friends performed funeral rites, and poured libations 
through a hole in the floor. Dr. Thomson (“ Land and Book”) 
thus describes the rock-cut tombs in the region between Tyre 
and Sidon: “ They are nearly all of the same form, having a 
small chamber in front, and a door leading from that into the 
tomb, which is about six feet square, with niches on three sides 
for the dead.” A propensity to take up the abode in the tombs is 
mentioned by ancient physicians as a characteristic of mad- 
men. The Levitical uncleanness of the tombs would insure the 
wretches the solitude which they sought. Trench (“ Notes on 
the Miracles”) cites the following incident from Warburton 
(“The Crescent and the Cross”): ‘On descending from these 
heights I found myself in a cemetery whose sculptured turbans 
showed me that the neighboring village was Moslem. The 
silence of night was now broken by fierce yells and howlings, 
which I discovered proceeded from a naked maniac who was 
fighting with some wild dogs for a bone. The moment he per- 
ceived me he left his canine comrades, and bounding along with 
rapid strides, seized my horse’s bridle, and almost forced him 
backward over the cliff.” 


Fierce (yaAezol). Originally, dificult, hard. ence hard 
to manage; intractable. 


32. A steep place (rod xpnuvod). Much better the steep 
(Rev.). Not an overhanging precipice, but a steep, almost per- 
pendicular declivity, between the base of which and the water 
was a narrow margin of ground, in which there was not room 
for the swine to recover from their headlong rush. Dr. Thom- 
son (“Land and Book”) says: “ Farther south the plain be- 
comes so broad that the herd might have recovered and recoiled 
from the lake.” The article localizes the steep as in the vicin- 
ity of the pasture. 


Cu. IX] MATTHEW. 55 


CHAPTER LX, 


9. Receipt of custom (rer@viov). Rev., place of toll. Wyc., 
tocbooth, toll-booth, or toll-cabin, which is an excellent word, 
though obsolete. Sitting at, is, literally, sitting on: the ele- 
vated platform or bench which was the principal feature of the 
toll-office, as in modern custom-bazaars, being put for the whole 
establishment. This customs-office was at Capernaum, the land- 
ing-place for the many ships which traversed the lake or coasted 
from town to town; and this not only for those who had business 
in Capernaum, but for those who would there strike the great 
road of eastern commerce from Damascus to the harbors of the 
West. Cicero, in his oration on the Consular Provinces, ac- 
cuses Gabinius, the pro-consul of Syria, of relieving the Syrians 
and Jews of some of their legitimate taxes, and of ordering the 
smali buildings to be taken down, which the publicans had 
erected at the approaches to bridges, or at the termination of 
roads, or in the harbors, for the convenience of their slaves 
and collectors. 


16. New (ayvadov). From a, not, and yvdrrTw, to card or 
comb wool; hence to dress or full cloth. Therefore Rev. 
renders more correctly undressed cloth, which would shrink 
when wet, and tear loose from the old piece. Wyc. renders 
rude. Jesus thus pictures the combination of the old forms of 
piety peculiar to John and his disciples with the new religious 
life emanating from himself, as the patching of an old garment 
with a piece of unfulled cloth, which would stretch and tear 
loose from the old fabric and make a worse rent than before. 


17. Bottles (acxovs). Rev., rightly, wine-skns, though our 
word bottle originally carried the true meaning, being a bottle 
of leather. In Spanish, dota means a leather bottle, a boot, and a 
butt. In Spain wine is still brought to market in pig-skins. In 
the East, goat-skins are commonly used, with the rough side 
inward. When old, they break under the fermentation of the 
wine. 


56 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cz. LX 


18. Is even now dead (dpru érerevTnaev). The literal force 
of the aorist tense is more graphic. Just now died. 


20. Hem (xpaomédov). Rev., border. The fringe worn on 
the border of the outer garment, according to the command in 
Num. xv. 38. Dr. Edersheim (‘Life and Times of Jesus ”) 
says that, according to tradition, each of the white fringes was 
to consist of eight threads, one of them wound round the others; 
first seven times, with a double knot; then eight times with a 
double knot; then eleven times with a double knot; and, 
lastly, thirteen times. The Hebrew characters representing 
these numbers formed the words Jehovah One. 


23. Minstrels (avAnras). More correctly, as Rev., jlute- 
players, hired or volunteering as mourners. 


Making a noise (JopuBovpevor). Rev., twmult. Repre- 
senting the loud screaming and wailing by the women. It is 
the word used in Acts xvii. 5: “Set the city in an uproar.” 


32. Dumb (xwdov). The word is also used of deafness (Matt. 
xi. 5; Mark vii. 82; Luke vii. 22). It means dull or blunted. 
Thus Homer applies it to the earth; the dull, senseless earth 
(“ Iliad,” xxiv., 25). Also to a blunted dart (“ Iliad,” xi., 390). 
The classical writers use it of speech, hearing, sight, and mental 
perception. In the New Testament, only of hearing and speech, 
the meaning in each case being determined by the context. 


36. Fainted (jcav éoxvdpévar). Rev., better, were distressed. 
Note the verb with the participle, denoting their habctwal con- 
dition. The word orginally means to flay, rend, or mangle. 
Aschylus uses it of the tearing of dead bodies by fish (“ Persae,” 
577). As appropriate to the figure of sheep, it might be ren- 
dered here fleeced. Wyce., they were travailed. 


Scattered (€ppyupévor). So A. V. and Rev. The word is 
the perfect participle passive of platw, to throw or cast, and 
means thrown down, prostrated. So Wyc., lying. It isnot the 


Me creXe MATTHEW. ye 


dispersion one from another, but their prostration in themselves 
that is meant. They have cast themselves down for very wear- 
iness. 


38. Send forth (€x8dry). So A. V. and Rev. But the 
word is stronger: thrust out, force them out, as from urgent 
necessity. 


GHA PT li AX: 


1. The disciples (tovs wadntas). The or his, referring to 
them as already chosen, though he nowhere relates their choos- 
ing. See Mark iii. 14; Luke vi. 13. 


2. Apostles (azrocréAwv). Compare disciples, ver. i. Apos- 
tles is the official term, used here for the first time. They were 
merely learners (disciples, wadntai) until Christ gave them 
authority. From azrocté\da, to send away. An apostle is one 
sent forth. Compare John xiii. 16 and Rev., one that cs sent. 
Cremer (“ Biblico-Theological Lexicon”) suggests that it was 
the rare occurrence of the word in profane Greek that made it 
all the more appropriate as the distinctive appellation of the 
twelve. Compare Luke vi. 13; Actsi. 2. Also, John xvii. 18, 
I have sent. The word is once used of Christ (Heb. iii. 1), and 
in a very general sense to denote any one sent (2 Cor. viii. 23 ; 
Philip. ii. 25). 


4. The Canaanite (o Kavavaios). Rev., Cananaean. The 
word has nothing to do with Canaan. In Luke vi. 15; Acts i. 
18, the same apostle is called Zelotes. Both terms indicate his 
connection with the Galilaean Zealot party, a sect which stood 
for the recovery of Jewish freedom and the maintenance of 
distinctive Jewish institutions. From the Hebrew hanna, zeal- 
ous ; compare the Chaldee kandn, by which this sect was de. 
noted. 


5. Judas Iscariot (o Icxapiétns). The article distinguishes 
him from others of the name of Judas (compare John xiv. 22). 


58 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. X. 


Iscariot is usually explained as a compound, meaning the man 
of Kerioth, with reference to his native town, which is given in 
Joshua (xv. 25) as one of the uttermost cities of Judah toward 
the coast of Edom southward. 

In the four catalogues of the apostles (here; Mark iii. 16 ; 
Luke vi. 14; Acts i. 18) Simon Peter always stands first. Here 
expressly ; “first Simon.” Notice that Matthew names them 
in pairs, and compare Mark vi. 7, “sent them forth two and 
two.” The arrangement of the different lists varies; but 
throughout, Peter is the leader of the first four, Philip of the 
second, and James, son of Alphaeus, of the third. 


6. The lostsheep (ra mpo8ata ta arroAwdcTa). The Greek 
order throws the emphasis on Jost; the sheep, the lost ones. 
Bengel observes that Jesus says lost oftener than led astray. 
Compare xviii. 12, 14. 


9. Brass (yadxov). Properly copper. A decending climax. 
Copper would be as unnecessary as gold. 


10. Staves (pd8dous). But the proper reading is staff, 
(pa86or.) 


The workman is worthy, etc. Ver. 11, There abide, etc. 
“The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles,” a tract discovered in 
1873 in the library of the monastery of the Most Holy Sepul- 
chre at Constantinople, by Bryennios, Metropolitan of Nicome- 
dia, is assigned to the date of 120 a.p., and by some scholars is 
placed as early as 100 a.p. It is addressed to Gentile Christians, 
and is designed to give them practical instruction in the Chris- 
tian life, according to the teachings of the twelve apostles and 
of the Lord himself. In the eleventh chapter we read as fol- 
lows: “ And every apostle who cometh to you, let him be re- 
ceived as the Lord ; but he shall not remain except for one day ; 
if, however, there be need, then the next day ; but if he remain 
three days, he is a false prophet. But when the apostle de- 
parteth, let him take nothing except bread enough till he lodge 
again, but if he ask money, he is a false prophet.” And again 


Cu. X.J MATTHEW. 59 


(ch. xili.): “ Likewise a true teacher, he also is worthy like the 
workman, of hissupport. Every first-fruit, then, of the products 
of wine-press and threshing-floor, of oxen and sheep, thou shalt 
take and give to the prophets, for they are your high-priests. 

If thou makest a baking of bread, take the first of 
it and give according to the commandment. In like manner, 
when thou openest a jar of wine or oil, take the first of it and 
give to the prophets; and of money and clothing, and every 
possession, take the first, as may seem right to thee, and give 
according to the commandment.” 


12. When ye come into (eicepydpevor). The Greek indi- 
cates more distinctly the simultaneonsness of the entrance and 
the salutation: as ye are entering. Rev., as ye enter. So of 
the departure, as ye are going forth (éEepyopevot, ver. 14). 


14. Shake off (é«rwdtate). “The very dust of a heathen 
country was unclean, and it defiled by contact. It was re- 
garded like a grave, or like the putrescence of death. If a spot 
of heathen dust had touched an offering, it must at once be 
burnt. More than that, if by mischance any heathen dust had 
been brought into Palestine, it did not and could not mingle 
with that of ‘the land,’ but remained to the end what it had 
been—unclean, defiled and defiling everything to which it ad- 
hered.” The apostles, therefore, were not only to leave the 
house or city which should refuse to receive them, “ but it was 
to be considered and treated as if it were heathen, just as in 
the similar case mentioned in Matt. xviii. 17. All contact with 
such must be avoided, all trace of it shaken off” (Edersheim, 
“ Jewish Social Life in the Days of Christ”). The symbolic 
act indicated that the apostles and their Lord regarded them not 
only as unclean, but as entirely responsible for their unclean- 
ness. See Acts xviii. 6. 


16. | send you forth (éy dmocréd\dkw). Cognate to the 
word amocrtonXos (apostiec). The J is emphatic: “It is Z that 
send you forth.” 


60 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. Ohne 


Wise (dpéviyor). So A. V. and Rev. Denoting prudence 
with regard to their own safety. Wyc., wary. 


Harmless (dxépasov). Lit., wnmimed, unadulterated. Used 
of wine without water, and of metal without alloy. Hence 
guileless. So Luther, without falsity. Compare Rom. xvi. 
19; Philip. ii. 15. They were to imitate the serpent’s WAriness, 
but not his wliness. “The presence of the wolves demands 
that ye be wary; the fact that ye are my apostles (compare 
“J send you”) demands that ye be gueleless” (Dr. Morison on 
Matthew). 


17. Of men (trav avIporev). Lit., “the men,” already al- 
luded to under the term wolves. 


19. Take no thought (7 wepyurvyjonte). Rev., Be not 
anxious. See on vi. 25. 


In that hour (év éxetvy 7H @pa). Very precise. “In that 
selfsame hour.” Bengel remarks: “Even though not before. 
Many feel most strongly their spiritual power when the hour 
comes to impart it to others.” 


25. Beelzebub (BeerteBodd, Beelzebul). There is a coarse 
witticism in the application of the word to Christ. Jesus calls 
himself ‘“‘the Master of the house,” and the Jews apply to him 
the corresponding title of the Devil, Heb., Beelzebul, Master 
of the dwelling. (The phrase reappears in German, where the 
Devil is sometimes called Herr vom Haus. See Goethe, 
“Faust,” sc. xxi.). Dr. Edersheim’s explanation, though in- 
genious, seems far-fetched. He says that szebuhl, in Rabbinic 
language, means, not any ordinary dwelling, but specifically the 
temple ; so that Beelzebul would be Master of the Temple, an 
expression having reference to the claims of Jesus on his first 
purification of the temple. He then conceives a play between 
this word and Beelztbbul, meaning Lord of idolatrous sacrijice, 
and says: “ The Lord of the temple was to them the chief of 
idolatrous worship; the representative of God, that of the 


Cu. X.] MATTHEW. 61 


worst of demons. Beelzebul was Beelzibbul. What, then, 
might his household expect at their hands?” (“ Life and Times 
of Jesus ”). 


27. Preach («npvéate). Better Rev., proclaim. See on 
Matt. iv. 17. 


29. Sparrows (ctpov9ia). The word is a diminutive, little 
sparrows, and carries with it a touch of tenderness. At the 
present day, in the markets of Jerusalem and Jaffa, long 
strings of little birds, sparrows and larks, are offered for sale, 
trussed on long wooden skewers. Edersheim thinks that Jesus 
may have had reference to the two sparrows which, according 
to the Rabbins, were used in the ceremonial of purification 
from leprosy (Lev. xiv. 49-54). 


Shall not fall. A Rabbinic legend relates how a certain 
Rabbi had been for thirteen years hiding from his persecutors 
in a cave, where he was miraculously fed; when he observed 
that when the bird-catcher laid his snare, the bird escaped or 
was caught, according as a voice from heaven proclaimed 
“Mercy” or “Destruction.” Arguing that if even a sparrow 
cannot be caught without heaven’s bidding, how much more 
safe was the life of a son of man, he came forth. 


39. Confess me (suoroyyjce év eol). A peculiar but very 
significant expression. Lit., “ Confess im me.” The idea is 
that of confessing Christ out of a state of oneness with him. 
“ Abide in me, and being in me, confess me.” It implies iden- 
tification of the confessor with the confessed, and thus takes 
confession out of the category of mere formal or verbal acknowl- 
edgment. “Not every one that saith unto me, * Lord! Lord !” 
shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.” The true confessor 
of Christ is one whose faith rests in him. Observe that this 
gives great force to the corresponding clause, in which Christ 
places himself in a similar relation with those whom he con- 
fesses. “I will confess in him.” It shall be as if I spoke 
abiding in him. “I in them and thou in me, that they may be 


62 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cm XS 


perfected into one, and that the world may know that thou hast 
sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me” (John 
Xvii. 23). 


34. To send (Banreiv). Lit., to throw or cast. By this word 
the expectancy of the disciples is dramatically pictured, as if he 
represented them as eagerly looking up for peace as something 
to be flung down upon the earth from heaven. Dr. Morison 
gives the picture thus: “All are on tiptoe of expectation. 
What is it that is about to happen? Is it the reign of peace 
that is just about to be inaugurated and consummated ? Is there 
henceforth to be only unity and amity? As they muse and de- 
bate, lo! a sword is flung into the midst.” 


35. Set at variance (Suydoa). Lit., part asunder. Wyc., 
to depart = part. 


Daughter-in-law (viudnv). So A. V. and Rev.; but the 
full force is lost in this rendering. The word means bride, 
and though sometimes used in classical Greek of any married 
woman, it carries a notion of comparative youth. Thus in 
Homer, “ Odyssey,” iv., 743, the aged nurse, Euryclea, addresses 
Penelope (certainly not a bride) as vyugda pirn (dear bride), of 
course as a term of affection or petting. Compare “ Iliad,” iii., 
130, where Iris addresses Helen in the same way. The radical 
and bitter character of the division brought into households by 
the Gospel is shown by the fact of its affecting domestic rela- 
tions in their very freshness. The newly-married wife shall be 
set at variance with her mother-in-law. Wrycliffe’s rendering 
is peculiar: And the son’s wife against the wifes or husband's 
mother. 


38. His cross (Tov oravpov avtod). This was no Jewish 
proverb, crucifixion not being a Jewish punishment; so that 
Jesus uses the phrase anticipatively, in view of the death which 
he himself was to die. This was one of those sayings described 
in John xii. 16, which the disciples understood not at the first, 
but the meaning of which was revealed in the light of later 


Cu. XL] MATTHEW. 63 


events. The figure itself was borrowed from the practice which 
compelled criminals to bear their own cross to the place of 
execution. is cross: his own. All are not alike. There 
are different crosses for different disciples. The English pro- 
verb runs: “Every cross hath its inscription”—the name of 
him for whom it is shaped. 


39, Findeth (evpav). The word is really a past participle, 
found. Our Lord looked back in thought to each man’s past, 
and forward to its appropriate consummation in the future. 
Similarly, he who lost (arrodécas). Plato seems to have fore- 
shadowed this wonderful thought. ‘‘O my friend! I want you 
to see that the noble and the good may possibly be something 
different from saving and being saved, and that he who is truly 
a man ought not to care about living a certain time: he knows, 
as women say, that we must all die, and therefore he is not fond 
of life ; he leaves all that with God, and considers in what way 
he can best spend his appointed term ” (“‘ Gorgias,” 512). Still 
more to the point, Euripides : 


‘‘Who knows if life be not death, and death life?” 


CHAPTER XI. 


1. Commanding (d:atdcowv). The preposition dé has a 
distributive force: giving to each his appropriate charge. 


Their cities (avvév). The towns of those to whom he came

2. Two of his disciples (6v0). But the correct reading is

7. As they departed (rovrwy 5é ropevopévor). Revy., more 
literal and better, as these went their way ; or while they, John’s 
disciples, were departing: thus giving the simltaneousness of 
Jesus’ words with the act of departure. 


To see (SedoacIa). Rev., to behold. JedcIat, like Sewpety, 
expresses the calm, continuous contemplation of an object which 
remains before the spectator. Compare John i. 14. Another verb 
is used in Christ’s repetition of the question, vv. 8, 9; édety in 
the ordinary sense of seeing. The more earnest expression 
suits the first question. 


12. Suffereth violence (@idferar). Lit., as forced, over- 
powered, taken by storm. Christ thus graphically portrays the 
intense excitement which followed John’s ministry ; the eager 
waiting, striving, and struggling of the multitude for the prom- 
ised king. 


The violent take it by force (Qvacral dprdfovew avtny). 
This was proved by the multitudes who followed Christ and 
thronged the doors where he was, and would have taken him by 
force (the same word) and made him aking (John vi. 15). The 
word take by force means literally to snatch away, carry off. It 
is often used in the classics of plundering. Meyer renders, 
Those who use violent efforts, drag it to themselves. So Tynd., 
They that make violence pull it unto them. Christ speaks of 
believers. They seize upon the kingdom and make it their 
own. The Rev., men of violence, is too strong, since it de- 
scribes a class of habitually and characteristically violent men ; 
whereas the violence in this case is the result of a special and 
exceptional impulse. The passage recalls the old Greek proverb 
quoted by Plato against the Sophists, who had corrupted the 


Gua xt) MATTHEW. 65 


Athenian youth by promising the easy attainment of wisdom : 
Good things are hard. Dante has seized the idea: 


‘“« Regnum coelorum (the kingdom of heaven) suffereth violence 
From fervent love, and from that living hope 
That overcometh the divine volition; 
Not in the guise that man o’ercometh man, 
But conquers it because it will be conquered, 
And conquered, conquers by benignity.” 
Parad., xx., 94-99. 


14. If ye will (2 $édere). More correctly, Rev., Jf ye are 
willing or disposed. For there would naturally be an unwill- 
ingness to receive the statement about John’s high place, in 
view of John’s imprisonment. 


16. Children (sacdéous). Diminutive, little children. The 
Rev. Donald Fraser gives the picture simply and vividly: “ He 
pictured a group of little children playing at make-believe mar- 
riages and funerals. First they acted a marriage procession ; some 
of them piping as on instruments of music, while the rest were 
expected to leap and dance. In a perverse mood, however, these 
last did not respond, but stood still and looked discontented. 
So the little pipers changed their game and proposed a funeral. 
They began to imitate the loud wailing of eastern mourners. 
But again they were thwarted, for their companions refused 
to chime in with the mournful cry and to beat their breasts. 

So the disappointed children complained : ‘ We piped 
unto you and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not 
mourn. Nothing pleases you. If you don’t want to dance, 
why don’t you mourn? . . . It is plain that you are in 
bad humor, and determined not to be pleased’” (“ Metaphors in 
the Gospels”). The issue is between the Jews (this generation) 
and the children of wisdom, v. 9. 


Market-places (dyopais). From ayeipa, to assemble. Wyc., 
renders cheepynge; compare cheapside, the place for buying and 
selling ; for the word cheap had originally no reference to small 
price, but meant simply barter or price. The primary concep- 

5 


66 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XL 


tion in the Greek word has nothing to do with buying and sell- 
ing. Ayopd is an assembly; then the place of assembly. The 
idea of a place of trade comes in afterward, and naturally, 
since trade plants itself where people habitually gather. Hence 
the Roman Forum was devoted, not only to popular and judi- 
cial assemblies, but to commercial purposes, especially of bank- 
ers. The ideaof trade gradually becomes the dominant one in 
the word. In Eastern cities the markets are held in bazaars and 
streets, rather than in squares. In these public places the chil- 
dren would be found playing. Compare Zech. viii. 5. 


17. Mourn (ékéyao%e). Lit., deat or strike (the breast), as 
in oriental funeral lamentations. 


20. Mighty works (Suvdues). The supernatural works of 
Christ and his apostles are denoted by six different words in 
the New Testament, exhibiting these works under different 
aspects and from different points of view. These will be con- 
sidered in detail as they occur. Generally, a miracle may be 
regarded: 1. As a portent or prodigy (7épas) ; as Acts vii. 36, 
of the wonders shown by Moses in Egypt. 2. As a sign 
(onpetov), pointing to something beyond itself, a mark of the 
power or grace of the doer or of his connection with the super- 
natural world. So Matt. xii. 38. 3. As an exhibition of God’s 
glory (évdo£ov), Luke xiii. 17; glorious things. 4. As a strange 
thing (7apdSo£ov), Luke v.26. 5. As a wonderful thing (Savpd- 
cwov), Matt. xxi. 15. 6. As a power (Stvapis); so here: a 
mighty work. 


22, But (Av). Better Rev., howbert, or as Wyc., neverthe- 
less. Chorazin and Bethsaida did not repent; therefore a woe 
lies against them; nevertheless they shall be more excusable 
than you who have seen the mighty works which were not 
done among them. 


25. Answered. In reply to something which is not stated. 


I thank (é£owodoyovpuar). Compare Matt. ili. 6, of confessing 
sins. Lit., Z confess. I recognize the justice and wisdom of 


Cx. XI] MATTHEW. 67 


thy doings. But with the dative, as here (cou, to thee), it means 
to praise, with an undercurrent of acknowledgment ; to confess 
only in later Greek, and with an accusative of the object. Rev. 
gives praise in the margin here, and at Rom. xiv. 11. Tynd., 
I praise. 


Prudent (cvverov). Rev., understanding; Wyc., wary. 
From the verb ovvinus, to bring together, and denoting that 
peculiarity of mind which brings the simple features of an ob- 
ject into a whole. Hence comprehension, msight. Compare 
on Mark xii. 33, wnderstanding (cvvécews). Wese (copay) and 
understanding are often joined, as here. The general distinc- 
tion is between productive and reflective wisdom, but the dis- 
tinction is not always recognized by the writer. 


27. Are delivered (zrapedd3n). More lit., were delivered, 
as of a single act at a given time, as in this case, where the Son 
was sent forth by the Father, and clothed with authority. Com- 
pare xxviii. 18. 


Knoweth (éuywooxe). The compound indicating full 
knowledge. Others behold only in part, “through a glass, 
darkly.” 


28. Labor and are heavy-laden (xomiavtes nal mepopticpé- 
vot). The first an active, the second a passive participle, ex- 
hibiting the active and passive sides of human misery. 


Give rest (avaratcw). Originally to make to cease ; Tynd., 
ease; Wyc., refresh. The radical conception is that of relef. 


29. Yoke (fuyov). ‘These words, as recorded by St. Matthew, 
the Evangelist of the Jews, must have sunk the deeper into the 
hearts of Christ’s Jewish hearers, that they came in their own 
old, familiar form of speech, yet with such contrast of spirit. 
One of the most common figurative expressions of the time 
was that of the yoke for submission to an occupation or obliga- 
tion. Very instructive for the understanding of the figure is 


68 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XL 


this paraphrase of Cant. i. 10: ‘ How beautiful is their neck for 
bearing the yoke of thy statutes; and it shall be upon them 
like the yoke on the neck of the ox that plougheth in the field 
and provideth food for himself and his master.’ 

“The public worship of the ancient synagogue commenced 
with a benediction, followed by the shema (Hear, O Israel) or 
creed, composed of three passages of scripture : Deut. vi. 4-9 ; x1. 
13-21; Num. xv. 87-41. The section Deut. vi. 4-9,was said to 
precede xi. 13-21, so that we might take upon ourselves the yoke 
of the kingdom of heaven, and only after that the yoke of the 
commandments. The Saviour’s words must have had a special 
significance to those who remembered this lesson; and they 
would now understand how, by coming to the Saviour, they 
would first take on them the yoke of the kingdom of heaven, 
and then that of the commandments, finding this yoke easy and 
the burden light ” (Edersheim, “ Life and Times of Jesus,” and 
“ Jewish Social Life”). 


Meek (pais). See on Matt. v. 5. 


Lowly (razrewds). The word hasa history. In the classics 
it is used commonly in a bad and degrading sense, of meanness 
of condition, lowness of rank, and cringing abjectness and base- 
ness of character. Still, even in classical Greek, this is not its 
universal usage. It is occasionally employed in a way which 
foreshadows its higher sense. Plato, for instance, says, “To that 
law (of God) he would be happy who holds fast, and follows it 
in all Awmélty and order ; but he who is lifted up with pride, 
or money, or honor, or beauty, who has a soul hot with folly, 
and youth, and insolence, and thinks that he has no need of a 
guide or ruler, but is able himself to be the guide of others, he, 
I say, is left deserted of God” (“ Laws,” 716). And Aristotle 
says: “ He who is worthy of small things, and deems himself so, 
is wise” (*‘ Nich. Ethics,” iv., 3). At best, however, the classical 
conveption is only modesty, absence of assumption. It is an ele- 
ment of wisdom and in no way opposed to self-righteousness (see 
Aristotle above). The word for the Christian virtue of hwmit- 
ity (Tamrewodppoovvn), was not used before the Christian era, and 


Cu. XI.] MATTHEW. 69 


is distinctly an outgrowth of the Gospel. This virtue is based 
upon a correct estimate of our actual littleness, and is linked 
with a sense of sinfulness. True greatness is holiness. We 
are little because sinful. Compare Luke xviii. 14. It is asked 
how, in this view of the case, the word can be applied to himself 
by the sinless Lord ? “ The answer is,” says Archbishop Trench, 
“that for the sinner humility involves the confession of sin, in- 
asmuch as it involves the confession of his true condition ; 
while yet for the unfallen creature the grace itself as truly ex- 
ists, involving for such the acknowledgment, not of sinfwlness, 
which would be untrue, but of creatureliness, of absolute de- 
pendence, of having nothing, but receiving all things of God. 
And thus the grace of humility belongs to the highest angel be- 
fore the throne, being as he is a creature, yea, even to the Lord 
of Glory himself. In his human nature he must be the pattern 
of all humility, of all creaturely dependence ; and it is only as 
a man that Christ thus claims to be lowly; his human life was 
a constant living on the fulness of his Father’s love; he ever- 
more, as man, took the place which beseemed the creature in 
the presence of its Creator” (“ Synonyms,” p. 145). The Chris- 
tian virtue regards man not only with reference to God, but to 
his fellow-man. Jn lowliness of mind each counting other better 
than himself (Philip. ii. 3, Rev.). But this is contrary to the 
Greek conception of justice or righteousness, which was simply 
“his own to each one.” It is noteworthy that neither the Sep- 
tuagint, the Apocrypha, nor the New Testament recognize the 
ignoble classical sense of the word. 


Ye shall find (evpyjcere). Compare L will gwe you and ye 
shall find. The rest of Christ is twofold—gwen and found. 
It is given in pardon and reconciliation. It is found under the 
yoke and the burden; in the development of Christian experi- 
ence, as more and more the “ strain passes over” from self to 
Christ. ‘No other teacher, since the world began, has ever 
associated learn with rest. ‘Learn of me,’ says the philosopher, 
‘and you shall find restlessness.’ ‘Learn of me,’ says Christ, 
‘and you shall find rest?” (Drummond, “ Natural Law in the 
Spiritual World ”). 


70 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XIL 


30. Easy (ypnords). Nota satisfactory rendering. Christ’s 
yoke is not easy in the ordinary sense of that word. The word 
means originally, good, serviceable. The kindred noun, ypyo- 
rors, occurring only in Paul’s writings, is rendered kindness in 
2 Cor. vi. 6; Tit. iii. 4; Gal. v. 22; Eph. ii. 7 (Rev.), and good- 
ness, Rom. ii. 4 (Rev.). At Luke v. 39, it is used of old wine, 
where the true reading, instead of better, is good (xpnoros), mel- 
lowed with age. Plato (“ Republic,” 424) applies the word to 
education. “ Good nurture and education (tpopy yap Kal mas- 
Sevors ypnor)) implant good (ayaSas) constitutions; and these 
good (xpnorat) constitutions improve more and more;” thus 
evidently using ypnords and ayadeés as synonymous. The three 
meanings combine in the word, though it is impossible to find 
an English word which combines them all. Christ’s yoke is 
wholesome, serviceable, kindly. “ Christ’s yoke is like feathers 
toa bird; not loads, but helps to motion” (Jeremy Taylor). 


CHAPTER XII. 


1. Time (xasps). Rev., season. The word implies a par- 
ticular time ; as related to some event, a convenrent, appropriate 
time ; absolutely, a particular point of time, or a particular sea- 
son, like spring or winter. 


Corn (c7opipev). From ozetpw, to sow. Properly, as Rev., 
corn-fields. 


2. What is not lawful. “On any ordinary day this would 
have been lawful; but on the Sabbath it involved, according 
to the Rabbinic statutes, at least two sins, viz., plucking the ears, 
which was reaping, and rubbing them in their hands (Luke vi. 1), 
which was sifting, grinding, or fanning. The Talmud says: 
‘In case a woman rolls wheat to remove the husks, it is con- 
sidered as sifting; if she rubs the heads of wheat, it is regarded 
as threshing; if she cleans off the side-adherencies, it is sifting 
out fruit ; if she bruises the ears, it is grinding; if she throws 


them up in her hand, it is winnowing’” (Edersheim, “ Life and 
Times of Jesus ”). 


Cu. XII] MATTHEW. (0) 


6. One greater (uetf{wv). The correct reading makes the 
adjective neuter, so that the right rendering is something greater 
(Rev., in margin). The reference is, of course, to Christ him- 
self (compare vv. 41, 42, where the neuter wAétov, more (so 
Rev., in margin), is used in the same way). Compare, also, 
John ii. 19, where Christ speaks of his own body as a temple. 
The indefiniteness of the neuter gives a more solemn and impres- 
sive sense. 


10. Is it lawful ? (ec &eorw). The ei can hardly be rendered 
into English. It gives an indeterminate, hesitating character 
to the question: J would like to know 7, ete. 


13. Stretch forth thy hand. The arm was not withered. 


20. Flax. The Hebrew is, literally, a dimly burning wick 
he shall not quench (Isa. xlii. 3). The quotation stops at the 
end of the third verse in the prophecy; but the succeeding 
verse is beautifully suggestive as describing the Servant of Je- 
hovah by the same figures in which he pictures his suffering 
ones—a@ wick and a reed. “He shall not burn dimly, neither 
shall his spirit be crushed.” He himself, partaking of the na- 
ture of our frail humanity, is both a lamp and a reed, humble, 
but not to be broken, and the “light of the world.” Compare 
the beautiful passage in Dante, where Cato directs Virgil to 
wash away the stains of the nether world from Dante's face, 
and to prepare him for the ascent of the purgatorial mount by 
girding him with a rush, the emblem of humility : 


‘Go, then, and see thou gird this one about 
With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face, 
So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom. 
For ‘twere not fitting that the eye o’ercast 
By any mist should go before the first 
Angel, who is of those of Paradise. 

This little island, round about its base, 

Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it, 

Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze. 

No other plant that putteth forth the leaf, 

Or that doth indurate, can there have life, 
Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks. 


72 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XIL 


There he begirt me as the other pleased ; 
O marvellous! for even as he culled 
The humble plant, such it sprang up again 
Suddenly there where he uprooted it.” 
Purg., i., 94-105, 183-187. 


26. He is divided (€uepicdn. Lit., “he was divided.” If 
he is casting Aemself out, there must have been a previous 
division. 


28. Is come unto you (é6Jacev éf’ tyas). The verb is 
used in the simple sense to arrwe at (2 Cor. x. 14; Philip. iii. 
16), and sometimes to anticipate (1 Thess. iv. 15). Here with 
a suggestion of the latter sense, which is also conveyed by the 
Rey., “come upon.” It has come upon you before you ex- 
pected it. 


29. Of a strong man (rod icyvpod). Rev. rightly gives the 
force of the article, the strong man. Christ is not citing a gen- 
eral illustration, but is pointing to a specific enemy—Satan. 
How can I despoil Satan without first having conquered him ? 


Goods (cxevn). The word originally means a vessel, and so 
mostly in the New Testament. See Mark xi. 16; John xix. 29. 
But also the entire equipment of a house, collectively : chattels, 
house-gear. Also the baggage of an army. Here in the sense 
of house-gear. Compare Luke xvii. 81; Acts xxvii. 17, of the 
gear or tackling of the ship. Rev., lowered the gear. 


32. The Holy Spirit (rod wvedparos tod dyiov). The Spirit 
—the holy. These words define more clearly the blasphemy 
against the Spirit, ver. 31. 


35. Bringeth forth (ée@ddnrev). But the translation is fee- 
ble. The word means ¢o throw or fling out. The good or evil 
things come forth out of the treasure of the heart (34). “Out 
of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” The issues 
of the heart are thrown out, as if under pressure of the abun- 
dance within. 


Cu. XIIL} MATTHEW. 73 


36. Idle (apyov). A good rendering. The word is com- 
pounded of &, not, and épyov, work. An idle word is a non- 
working word; an inoperative word. It has no legitimate 
work, no office, no business, but is morally useless and unprofit- 
able. 


39. Adulterous (uovyanis). A very strong and graphic ex- 
pression, founded upon the familiar Hebrew representation of 
the relation of God’s people to him under the figure of marriage. 
See Ps. lxxiii. 27; Isa. lvii. 3 sqq.; Ixii. 5; Ezek. xxiii. 27. 
Hence idolatry and intercourse with Gentiles were described as 
adultery ; and so here, of moral unfaithfulness to God. Com- 
pare James iv. 4; Apoc. ii. 20 sqq. Thus Dante: 


‘Where Michael wrought 
Vengeance upon the proud adultery.” 
Tbpifag Spies. 


40. The whale (rod xjrovs). A general term for a sea-mon- 
ster. 


41. Shall rise up (avacrjcovta). Rev., stand up. Come 
forward as witnesses. Compare Job xvi. 9, Sept.; Mark xiv. 
57. There is no reference to rising from the dead. Similarly 
shall rise wp, ver. 42. Compare Matthew xi. 11; xxiv. 11. 


A greater (mciov). Lit., something more. See on ver. 6. 


49. Disciples (ua9nras). Not the apostles only, but all who 
followed him in the character of learners. The Anglo-Saxon 
renders learning knights. 


CHAPTER XIII. 


2. Shore (aiysanrov). Rev., beach, that over which the sea 
(Gs) rushes (aiscer). The word for shore, axrn, on which the 
sea breaks (aryvupt), is never used in the New Testament. Wyc., 
brink. 


74 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XIIL 


3. Parables (aapaBonrais). From mapd, beside, and Badd, 
to throw. A parable is a form of teaching in which one thing 
is thrown beside another. Hence its radical idea is comparison. 
Sir John Cheke renders bzword, and the same idea is conveyed 
by the German Beispiel, a pattern or example ; bet, beside, and 
the old high German spel, discourse or narration. 

The word is used with a wide range in scripture, but always 
involves the idea of comparison : 

1. Of brief sayings, having an oracular or proverbial char- 
acter. Thus Peter (Matt. xv. 15), referring to the words “If 
the blind lead the blind,” etc., says, ‘declare unto us this par- 
able.” Compare Luke vi. 89. So of the patched garment 
(Luke v. 36), and the guest who assumes the highest place at 
the feast (Luke xiv. 7, 11). Compare, also, Matt. xxiv. 32; 
Mark xiii. 28. 

2. Of a proverb. The word for proverb (rapoyia) has the 
same idea at the root as parable. It is rapa, beside, oiwos, a way 
or road. Either a trite, wayside saying (Trench), or a path by 
the side of the high road (Godet). See Luke iv. 23; 1 Sam. 
KX1Van lo: 

3. Of a song or poem, in which an example is set up by way 
of comparison. See Micah ii. 4; Hab. ii. 6. 

4. Of a word or discourse which is enigmatical or obscure 
until the meaning is developed by application or comparison. 
It occurs along with the words aiviyya, enigma, and mpo8dAnza, 
a problem, something put forth or proposed (apo, in front, 
Barro, to throw). See Ps. xlix. (Sept. xlviii.) 4; Lxxviii. (Sept. 
Ixxvii.) 2; Prov. i. 6, where we have wapaBorjv, parable ; 
oxotewov Adyov, dark saying; and aiviypata, enigmas. Used 
also of the sayings of Balaam (Num. xxiii. 7, 18; xxiv. 3, 15). 

In this sense Christ uses parables symbolically to expound 
the mysteries of the kingdom of God; as utterances which con- 
ceal from one class what they reveal to another (Matt. xiii. 
11-17), and in which familiar facts of the earthly life are used 
figuratively to expound truths of the higher life. The un- 
spiritual do not link these facts of the natural life with those 
of the supernatural, which are not discerned by them (1 Cor. ii. 
14), and therefore they need an interpreter of the relation be- 


Cu. XII] MATTHEW. 75 


tween the two. Such symbols assume the existence of a law 
common to the natural and spiritual worlds under which the 
symbol and the thing symbolized alike work; so that the one 
does not merely resemble the other superficially, but stands in 
actual coherence and harmony with it. Christ formulates such 
a law in connection with the parables of the Talents and the 
Sower. “To him that hath shall be given. From him that hath 
not shall be taken away.” That is a law of morals and religion, 
as of business and agriculture. One must ave in order to 
make. Interest requires capital. Fruit requires not only seed 
but sod. Spiritual fruitfulness requires an honest and good 
heart. Similarly, the law of growth as set forth in the parable 
of the Mustard Seed, is a law common to nature and to the 
kingdom of God. The great forces in both kingdoms are ger- 
minal, enwrapped in small seeds which unfold from within by 
an inherent power of growth. 

5. A parable is also an example or type ; furnishing a model 
or a warning ; as the Good Samaritan, the Rich Fool, the 
Pharisee and the Publican. The element of comparison enters 
here as between the particular incident imagined or recounted, 
and all cases of a similar kind. 

The term parable, however, as employed in ordinary Chris- 
tian phraseology, is limited to those utterances of Christ which 
are marked by a complete figurative history or narrative. It is 
thus defined by Goebel (“ Parables of Jesus »), “A narrative 
moving within the sphere of physical or human life, not pro- 
fessing to describe an event which actually took place, but 
expressly imagined for the purpose of representing, in pictorial 
figure, a truth belonging to the sphere of religion, and therefore 
referring to the relation of man or mankind to God.” 

In form the New Testament parables resemble the fable. The 
distinction between them does not turn on the respective use of 
rational and irrational beings speaking and acting. There are 
fables where the actors are human. Nor does the fable always 
deal with the impossible, since there are fables in which an 
animal, for instance, does nothing contrary to its nature. The 
distinction lies in the relégious character of the New Testament 
parable as contrasted with the secular character of the fable. 


76 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XIII, 


While the parable exhibits the relations of man to God, the 
fable teaches lessons of worldly policy or natural morality and 
utility. ‘The parable is predominantly symbolic; the fable, 
for the most part, typical, and therefore presents its teaching 
only in the form of example, for which reason it chooses ani- 
mals by preference, not as symbolic, but as typical figures ; 
never symbolic in the sense in which the parable mostly is, be- 
cause the higher invisible world, of which the parable sees and 
exhibits the symbol in the visible world of nature and man, lies 
far from it. Hence the parable can never work with fantastic 
figures like speaking animals, trees,” etc. (Goebel, condensed). 

The parable differs from the allegory in that there is in the 
latter “‘an interpenetration of the thing signified and the thing 
signifying ; the qualities and properties of the first being at- 
tributed to the last,” and the two being thus blended instead of 
being kept distinct and parallel. See, for example, the allegory 
of the Vine and the Branches (John xv.) where Christ at once 
identifies himself with the figure: “I am the true vine.” Thus 
the allegory, unlike the parable, carries its own interpretation 
with it. 

Parable and proverb are often used interchangeably in the 
New Testament; the fundamental conception being, as we 
have seen, the same in both, the same Hebrew word represent- 
ing both, and both being enigmatical. They differ rather in ex- 
tent than in essence; the parable being a proverb expanded and 
carried into detail, and being necessarily figurative, which the 
proverb is not ; though the range of the proverb is wider, since 
the parable expands only one particular case of a proverb. (See 
Trench, ‘“ Notes on the Parables,” Introd.) 


3. A sower (0 o7elpwy). Rev., the sower. Generic, as rep- 
resenting a class. 


To sow (rod ozreipew). “According to Jewish authorities, 
there was twofold sowing, as the seed was either cast by the 
hand or by means of cattle. In the latter case, a sack with holes 
was filled with corn and laid on the back of the animal, so that, 


Cu. XIII.) MATTHEW. V6 7/ 


as it moved onward, the seed was thickly scattered” (Eder- 
sheim, “ Life and Times of Jesus”). 


4, By the wayside. Dean Stanley, approaching the plain 
of Gennesareth, says: ‘A slight recess in the hillside, close 
upon the plain, disclosed at once, in detail and with a conjunc- 
tion which I remember nowhere else in Palestine, every feature 
of the great parable. There was the undulating cornfield de- 
scending to the water’s edge. There was the trodden pathway 
running through the midst of it, with no fence or hedge to pre- 
vent the seed from falling here and there on either side of it or 
upon it; itself hard with the constant tramp of horse and mule 
and human feet. There was the ‘good’ rich soil which dis- 
tinguishes the whole of that plain and its neighborhood from 
the bare hills elsewhere descending into the lake, and which, 
where there is no interruption, produces one vast mass of corn. 
There was the rocky ground of the hillside protruding here and 
there through the cornfields, as elsewhere through the grassy 
slopes. There were the large bushes of thorn—the nab&, that 
kind of which tradition says that the crown of thorns was woven 
—springing up, like the fruit-trees of the more inland parts, in 
the very midst of the waving wheat” (“Sinai and Palestine ”). 


5. Stony places. Not ground covered with loose stones, but 
a hard, rocky surface, covered with a thin layer of soil. 


4. Sprang up. The seed, therefore, fell, not among stand- 
ing thorns, but among those beneath the surface, ready to spring 
up. 
Trench (“ Parables”) cites a striking parallel from Ovid, de- 
scribing the obstacles to the growth of the grain: 


“« Now the too ardent sun, now furious showers, 
With baleful stars and bitter winds combine 
The crop to ravage; while the greedy fowl 
Snatch the strown seeds; and grass with stubborn roots, 
And thorn and darnel plague the ripening grain.” 
Metamorphoses, v., 486. 


7S WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XIIL 


8. A hundred-fold. Mentioned as something extraordinary. 
Compare Gen. xxvi. 12. Herodotus (i., 93) says of Babylonia, 
“In grain it is so fruitful as to yield commonly two-hundred- 
fold; and when the production is the greatest, even three-hun- 
dred-fold.” 


11. Mysteries (uvornpia). From pve, to close or shut. In 
classical Greek, applied to certain religious celebrations to which 
persons were admitted by formal initiation, and the precise 
character of which is unknown. Some suppose them to have 
been revelations of religious secrets; others of secret politico- 
religious doctrines; others, again, scenic representations of 
mythical legends. In this latter sense the term was used in the 
Middle Ages of miracle-plays—rude dramas representing scenes 
from scripture and from the apocryphal gospels. Such plays 
are still enacted among the Basque mountaineers. (See Vincent, 
‘Tn the Shadow of the Pyrenees.”) 

A mystery does not denote an unknowable thing, but one 
which is withdrawn from knowledge or manifestation, and 
which cannot be known without special manifestation of it. 
Hence appropriate to the things of the kingdom of heaven, 
which could be known only by revelation. Paul (Philip. iv. 12) 
says, “Iam instructed (wewinuar) both to be full and to be 
hungry,” etc. But Rev. gives more correctly the force of i- 
structed, by rendering [have learned the secret: the verb being 
pvéw (from the same root as puornpia) to initiate into the mys- 
teries. 


14. Is fulfilled (avadnpobrar). Rather of something in 
progress : is being fulfilled or im process of fulfilment. 


15. Is waxed gross (ézayvvIn). Lit., was made fat. Wyc., 
enfatted. 


Are dull of hearing (rois daly Bapéws Hxovaav). Lit., They 
heard heavily with their ears. 


They have closed (éxdypvoav), card, down, uve, to close, 
as in wvotnpia above. Our idiom shuts up the eyes. The 


Cu. XII] MATTHEW. 79 


Greek shutsthem down. The Hebrew, in Isa. vi. 10, is besmear. 
This insensibility is described as a punishment. Compare Isa. 
xxix. 10; xliv. 18; in both of which the closing of the eyes is 
described as a judgment of God. Sealing up the eyes was an 
oriental punishment. Cheyne (“ Isaiah ”) cites the case of a son 
of the Great Mogul, who had his eyes sealed up three years by 
his father as a punishment. Dante pictures the envious, on 
the second cornice of Purgatory, with their eyes sewed up: 


‘¢ For all their lids an iron wire transpierces, 
And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild 
Is done, because it will not quiet stay.” 
Purg., xiii., '70-72. 


Be converted (émictpépwow). Rev., turn again, én, to or 
toward, otpéda, to turn ; with the idea of their turning from 
their evil toward God. 


19. When any one heareth. Therendering would be made 
even more graphic by preserving the continuous force of the 
present tense, as exhibiting action in progress, and the simul- 
taneousness of Satan’s work with that of the gospel instructor. 
“ While any one zs hearing, the evil one 7s coming and snatch- 
ing away, just as the birds do not wait for the sower to be out 
of the way, but are at work while he is sowing. 


He which received seed (0 ozrapeds). Lit., and much bet- 
ter, Rev., He that was sown; identifying the seed of the figure 
with the mam signified. 


21. Dureth for a while (apdcxatpds éorw ). Rev., endureth. 
Lit., is temporary: thus bringing out the quality of the hearer. 
He is a creature of circumstances, changing as they change. 
Wyc., is temporal, with explanation, lasteth but a little time. 


For (Se). Rev. better, and, for the following clause does not 
give a reason for the temporariness, but adds something to the 
description of the hearer. 


80 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Ou. XIII. 


Tribulation (9rApews). IA(Ba, to press or squeeze. Tribu- 
lation is perhaps as accurate a rendering as is possible, being de- 
rived from ¢ribudwm, the threshing-roller of the Romans. In 
both the idea of presswre is dominant, though Jripus does not 
convey the idea of separation (as of corn from husk) which is 
implied in tribulatio. Trench cites, in illustration of SAApss, 
pressure, the provision of the old English law, by which those 
who wilfully refused to plead had heavy weights placed on 
their breasts, and so were pressed and crushed to death (“‘ Syn- 
onyms of the New Testament”). 


23. Understandeth (cumets). See on xi. 25, prudent. The 
three evangelists give three characteristics of the good hearer. 
Matthew, he understandeth the word; Mark, he receweth it ; 
Luke, he keepeth tt. 


24. Put he forth (capé9nxev). But this would be rather 
the translation of zpofaAXe@, from which wpo8rAnua, a problem, 
is derived, while the word here used means rather to set before 
or offer. Often used of meals, to serve up. Hence, better, 
Rev., set he before them. See on Luke ix. 16. 


25. Sowed (éréo7ecpev). The preposition éi, upon, indi- 
cates sowing over what was previously sown. Reyv., “ sowed 
also.” 


33. Leaven (fiun). Wyc., sour dough, as German Sauerteig. 
From éa, to boil or seethe, as in fermentation. The English 
leaven is from the Latin levare, to raise, and appears in the 
French devain. 


35. I will utter (épevEouar). The verb, in which the sound 
corresponds to the sense (erewxomaz), means originally to belch, 
to desgorge. Homer uses it of the sea surging against the shore 
(“Tliad,” xvii., 265). Pindar of the eruption of Aetna (“ Pyth.,” 
i, 40). There seems to lie in the word a sense of full, empas- 
stoned utterance, as of a prophet. 


From the foundation (a7ré catraBovjs). “It is assumed by 
the Psalmist (Ps. Ixxviii. 2) that there was a hidden meaning in 


Cu. XIIT.] MATTHEW. 81 


God’s ancient dealings with his people. A typical, archetypical, 
and prefigurative element ran through the whole. The history 
of the dealings is one long Old Testament parable. Things 
long kept secret, and that were hidden indeed in the depths of 
the divine mind from before the foundation of the world, were 
involved in these dealings. And hence the evangelist wisely 
sees, in the parabolic teaching of our Lord, a real culmination 
of the older parabolic teaching of the Psalmist. The culmina- 
tion was divinely intended, and hence the expression that it 


might be fulfilled” (Morison on Matthew). 


43. Shine forth (€kAduypovow). The compound verb with 
éx, forth, is designedly used to express a dissipating of dark- 
ness which has hidden: a bursting into light. The righteous 
shall shine forth as the sun from behind a cloud. The mixture 
of evil with good in the world obscures the good, and veils the 
true glory of righteous character. Compare Dan. xii. 3. 


47. Net (cayjvy). See on Matt. iv. 18. The only occur- 
rence of the word in the New Testament. A long draw-net, the 
ends of which are carried out and drawn together. Through 
the transcription of the word into the Latin sagena comes seine. 
From the fact of its making a great sweep, the Greeks formed 
a verb from it, caynvéva, to surround and take with a drag-net. 
Thus Herodotus (iii., 149) says: “The Persians netted Samos.” 
And again (vi., 31), ‘Whenever they became masters of an 
island, the barbarians, in every single instance, netted the in- 
habitants. Now, the mode in which they practise this netting 
is the following: Men join hands, so as to form a line across 
from the north coast to the south, and then march through the 
island from end to end, and hunt out the inhabitants.” Compare 
Isa. xix. 8: “Those who spread nets on the face of the waters 
shall languish.” Also, Hab. i. 15-17, where the Chaldaean con- 
quests are described under this figure. 


Gathered of every kind. Compare the graphic passage in 
Homer (“ Odyssey,” xxii., 884-389) of the slain suitors in the 


halls of Ulysses.

‘¢ He saw that all had fallen in blood and dust, 
Many as fishes on the shelving beach, 
Drawn from the hoary deep by those who tend 
The nets with myriad meshes. Poured abroad 
Upon the sand, while panting to return 
To the salt sea, they lie till the hot sun 
Takes their life from them.” 


48. Sat down. Implying deliberation in the assortment. 


52. Which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven. 
Instructed paSnrevsels. Rev., who hath been made a disciple 
to the kingdom, etc. The kingdom of heaven is personified. 
The disciples of Christ are disciples of that kingdom of which 
he is the representative. 


Which (écrts). The pronoun marks the householder as be- 
longing to a class and exhibiting the characteristic of the class: 
a householder—one of those who bring forth, ete. 


Bringeth forth (€«Barr«). Lit., flingeth forth. See on xii. 
35. Indicating his zeal in communicating instruction and the 
fulness out of which he speaks. 


CHAPTER XIV. 


1. Tetrarch. A ruler of a fourth part. Archelaus had ob- 
tained two-fourths of his father’s dominions, and Antipas (this 
Herod) and Philip each one-fourth. 


The fame (daxonv). Better as Rev., report. Lit., hearing. 


3. Put him in prison (év dudaKy amé9ero). Lit., “ put him 
away or aside” (am). This prison was the fortress of Machae- 
rus on the east side of the Dead Sea, almost on a line with 
Bethlehem, above the gorge which divided the Mountains of 
Abarim from the range of Pisgah. Perched on an isolated 
cliff at the end of a narrow ridge, encompassed with deep ra- 
vines, was the citadel. At the other end of this ridge Herod 
built a great wall, with towers two hundred feet high at the 


Cu. XIV.) MATTHEW. 83 


corners ; and within this inclosure, a magnificent palace, with 
colonnades, baths, cisterns, arsenals—every provision, in short, 
for luxury and for defence against siege. The windows com- 
manded a wide and grand prospect, including the Dead Sea, the 
course of the Jordan, and Jerusalem. In the detached citadel, 
probably in one of the underground dungeons, remains of which 
may still be seen, was the prison of John. “We return through 
what we regard as the ruins of the magnificent castle-palace of 
Herod, to the highest and strongest part of the defences—the 
eastern keep or the citadel, on the steep slope, one hundred and 
fifty yards up. The foundations of the walls all around, to the 
height of a yard or two above the ground, are still standing. 
As we clamber over them to examine the interior, we notice 
how small this keep is: exactly one hundred yards in diameter. 
There are scarcely any remains of it left. A well of great 
depth, and a deep, cemented cistern, with the vaulting of the 
roof still complete, and—of most terrible interest to us—two 
dungeons, one of them deep down, its sides scarcely broken in, 
‘with small holes still visible in the masonry where staples of 
wood and iron had once been fixed!’ As we look down into its 
hot darkness, we shudder in realizing that this terrible keep 
had, for nigh ten months, been the prison of that son of the 
free wilderness, the bold herald of the coming kingdom, the 
humble, earnest, self-denying John the Baptist” (Edersheim, 
“ Life and Times of Jesus”). 


6. Birthday (yeveoious). Though some explain it as the 
anniversary of Herod’s accession. The custom of celebrating 
birthdays by festivities was not approved by the strict Jews; 
but it is claimed that the Herodian princes adopted the custom. 
The Roman satirist, Persius, alludes to a festival known as 
“ Herod’s Day,” and pictures a banquet on that occasion. 


“But when 
Comes Herod’s day, and on the steaming panes 
The ranged lamps, festooned with violets, pour 
The unctuous cloud, while the broad tunny-tail 
Sprawled o’er the red dish swims, and snowy jars 


Swell with the wine.”’ 
Sat. v., 180-183. 


84 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XIV 


Before (év r@ péow.) Rev., in the midst. Wyc., leaped in 
the middle. 


7. He promised (aporoyncev.) Lit., confessed; conveying 
the idea of acknowledging the obligation of his oath. Salome 
had degraded herself to perform the part of an almeh or com- 
mon dancer, and could claim her reward. 


8. Being before instructed (mpoSiBac3eica). Wyc., mo- 
nestid, with warned in explanation. Both wrong. Reyv., rightly, 
being put forward. Compare Acts xix. 33, where the right 
meaning is, they pushed Alexander forward out of the crowd; 
and not as A. V., drew out. The correct rendering slightly 
relieves Salome of the charge of wanton cruelty, and throws 
it wholly upon Herodias. 


Here (@5e). She demanded it on the spot, before Herod 
should have had time to reflect and relent ; the more so, as she 
knew his respect for John (compare was sorry, ver. 9). The 
circumstances seem to point to Machaerus itself as the scene 
of the banquet; so that the deed could be quickly done, and 
the head of the Baptist delivered while the feast was still in 
progress. 


In a charger (é7t mivaxt). The Revisers cannot be defended 
in their retention of this thoroughly obsolete word. <A charge 
is originally a burden ; and a charger something loaded. Hence, 
a dish. Wye. dish. Tynd., platter. 


9. The oath’s sake (dia rods dpxous). But the A. V. puts 
the apostrophe in the wrong place. The word is plural, and 
the Rev. rightly renders for the sake of his oaths. It is implied 
that Herod in his mad excitement had confirmed his promise 
with repeated oaths. 


11. To the damsel (7é xopaciw). Diminutive, the little 
girl. Luther gives magdlei, little mand. 


Cu. XIV.) MATTHEW. 85 


13. On foot (7efq). Rev., by land in margin, which is bet- 
ter; for the contrast is between Jesus’ journey by she and 
that of the multitude by land. 


15. Desert (pnyos). In the Greek order standing first as 
emphatic. The dominant thought of the disciples is remote- 
ness from supplies of food. The first meaning of the word is 
solitary ; from which develops the idea of void, bereft, barren. 

Both meanings may well be included here. Note the two 
points of emphasis. The disciples say, Barren ws the place. 
Christ answers, Vo need have they to go away. 


Give (Sore). The disciples had said, “Send them away to 
buy for themselves.” Christ replies, Give ye. 


19. Brake. Asthe Jewish loaves were thin cakes, a thumb’s 
breadth in thickness, and more easily broken than cut. 


20. Were filled (e€yoptdcIncav). See on Matt. v. 6. 


Baskets (xodivovs). Wyc., coffins, a transcription of the 
Greek word. Juvenal, the Roman satirist, describes the grove 
of Numa, near the Capenian gate of Rome, as being “let out to 
the Jews, whose furniture is a basket (cophinus) and some hay ” 
(for a bed), “Sat.” iii., 14. These were small hand-baskets, 
specially provided for the Jews to carry levitically clean food 
while travelling in Samaria or other heathen districts. The 
word for basket used in relating the feeding of the four thou- 
sand (Matt. xv. 87) is omupts, a large provision-basket or ham- 
per, of the kind used for letting Paul down over the wall at 
Damascus (Acts ix. 25). In Matt. xvi. 9,10, Christ, in alluding 
to the two miracles, observes the distinctive term in each narra- 
tive; using xopivouvs in the case of the five thousand, and 
omvpidas in the other. Burgon (“Letters from Rome”) gives 
a drawing of a wicker basket used by the masons in the cathe- 
dral at Sorrento, and called céffano. He adds, “ Who can 
doubt that the basket of the gospel narrative was of the shape 
here represented, and that the denomination of thzs basket ex-

clusively has lingered in a Greek colony, where the Jews (who 
once carried the cophinus as a personal equipment) formerly 
lived in great numbers ? ” 


22. Constrained. Implying the disciples’ reluctance to 
leave him behind. 


24. Tossed (Bacavitouevov). Rev., better, distressed. See 
on Matt. iv. 24. 


26. A spirit (pdvracua). Of which our word phantasm is 
a transcription. Rev., rather stiffly, apparition. Wyc., phan- 
tom. 


29. To go to (éAJeiv mpos). But some of the best. texts 
read cai 7ASev mpds, and went toward. 


30. He was afraid. “Although,” says Bengel, “a fisher- 
man and a good swimmer” (John xxi. 7). 


32. Ceased (éxdracev). A beautiful word. Lit., grew weary ; 
sank away like one who is weary. 


36. Were made perfectly whole (Svec®Incav). The prepo- 
sition dud, through or thorough, indicates complete restoration. 

The Rev. omits perfectly, because whole, in itself, implies 
completeness. 


CHAPTER XV. 
1. Transgress (sapaBatvovow). Lit., to step on one side. 


2. Wash not their hands. Washing before meals was 
alone regarded as a commandment, washing after meals only 
as a duty. By and by the more rigorous actually washed 
between the courses, although this was declared to be purely 
voluntary. The distinctive designation for washing after meals 


Cu. XV.] MATTHEW. 87 


was the lifting of the hands; while for washing before meat a 
term was used which meant, literally, to rwb. If “holy,” z.e., 
sacrificial food was to be partaken of, a complete immersion of 
the hands, and not a mere “uplifting” was prescribed. As 
the purifications were so frequent, and care had to be taken 
that the water had not been used for other purposes, or some- 
thing fallen into it that might discolor or defile it, large vessels 
or jars were generally kept for the purpose (see John ii. 6). 
It was the practice to draw water out of these with a kind of 
ladle or bucket—very often of glass—which must hold at least 
one and a half egg-shells (compare draw out now, John ii. 8). 
The water was poured on both hands, which must be free of 
anything covering them, snch as gravel, mortar, etc. The 
hands were lifted up so as to make the water run to the wrist, 
in order to insure that the whole hand was washed, and that 
the water polluted by the hand did not again run down the 
fingers. Similarly, each hand was rubbed with the other (the 
fist), provided the hand that rubbed had been affused; other- 
wise, the rubbing might be done against the head, or even 
against a wall. But there was one point on which special 
stress was laid. In the “‘first affusion,’ which was all that 
originally was required when the hands were not levitically 
“defiled,” the water had to run down to the wrist. If the 
water remained short of the wrist, the hands were not clean. 
See on Mark vii. 8 (Edersheim, “ Life and Times of Jesus”). 


3. Also (al). The significance of this little word must not 
be overlooked. Christ admits that the disciples had trans- 
gressed a /wman injunction, but adds, ‘ Ye also transgress, and 
in a much greater way.” “ Whether the disciples transgress or 
not, you are the greatest transgressors” (Bengel). The one 
question is met with the other in the same style. Luther says, 
“He places one wedge against the other, and therewith drives 
the first back.” 


4. Die the death (Savdrw redevtdtw). The Hebrew idiom 
is, he shall certainly be executed. The Greek is, lit., let him 
come to his end by death. 


88 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XV. 


5. It is a gift (S@pov). Rev., given to God. The picture is 
that of a churlish son evading the duty of assisting his needy 
parents by uttering the formula, Corban, it is a gift to God. 
“ Whatever that may be by which you might be helped by me, 
is not mine to give. It is vowed to God.” The man, how- 
ever, was not bound in that case to give his gift to the temple- 
treasury, while he was bound not to help his parent ; because 
the phrase did not necessarily dedicate the gift to the temple. 
By a quibble it was regarded as something like Corban, as if it 
were laid on the altar and put entirely out of reach. It was 
expressly stated that such a vow was binding, even if what was 
vowed involved a breach of the law. 


6. Have made of none effect (jxvpmcare). Rev., made 
void ; a, not, kipos, authority. Ye have deprived it of its 
authority. 


7. Well (cadra@s). Admirably. 
8. Is far (azréyer). Lit., holds off from me. 


19. Out of the heart. Compare Plato. “For all good 
and evil, whether in the body or in human nature, originates, 
as he declared, in the soul, and overflows from thence, as from 
the head into the eyes; and therefore, if the head and body 
are to be well, you must begin by curing the soul. That is the 
first thing” (“‘ Charmides,” 15’). 


Thoughts (Scaroyicpol). Lit., reasonings (compare Mark 
ix. 33, Rev.), or desputengs (Philip. ii. 14), like the captious 
questioning of the Pharisees about washing hands. 


21. Coasts (uépn). Lit., and better, as Rev., parts. 


22. Out of the same coasts (a6 trav dpiwv éxelvwr). _Lit., 
as Rev., from those borders; 7.e., she crossed from Pheenicia 
into Galilee. 


Cu. XV.) MATTHEW. 89 


Cried (éxpavyacev). With a loud, émportunate cry: from 
behind. Compare after, ver. 23. 


Me. Making her daughter’s misery her own. 


Grievously vexed with a devil (xaxas dawovifera). Lit., 
is badly demonized. Sir J. Cheke, very evil devilled. 


23. Send her away. With her request granted; for, as 
Bengel exquisitely remarks, “ Thus Christ was accustomed to 
send away.” 


26. Children’s (rev réxvwv). Bengel observes that while 
Christ spoke severely to the Jews, he spoke honorably of them 
to those without. Compare John iv. 22. 


Dogs («uvapios). Diminutive: little dogs. In ver. 27, Wye. 
renders the little whelps, and Tynd., in both verses, whelps. 
The picture is of a family meal, with the pet house-dogs run- 
ning round the table. 


Their masters. The children are the masters of the little 
dogs. Compare Mark vii. 28, ‘the chaldren’s crumbs.” 


30. Cast them down (épupav). Very graphic.  Lit., 
flung them down ; not carelessly, but am haste, because so many 
were coming on the same errand. 


32. I will not (od 94.1). The A. V. might easily be mis- 
taken for the simple future of the verb send. But two verbs 
are used: the verb / will expressing Jesus’ feeling or disposi- 
tion. The Greek order is, and to send them away fasting Lam 
not willing. Therefore Rev. is better: Z would not. 


Faint (écrvIaow). Lit., be unstrung or relaned. 


90 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.  [Cu. XVI. 


34. Little fishes (¢yJvéca). Diminutive. The disciples make 
their provision seem as small as possible. In ver. 36 the 
diminutive is not used. 


35. On the ground (él ti yhv). Compare Mark viii. 6. 
On the occasion of feeding the five thousand, the multitude sat 
down on the grass (émi tovs yoptous), Matt. xiv. 19. It was 
then the month of flowers. Compare Mark vi. 39, the green 
grass, and John vi. 10, much grass. On the present occasion, 
several weeks later, the grass would be burnt up, so that they 
would sit on the ground. 


Gave thanks. According to the Jewish ordinance, the head 
of the house was to speak the blessing only if he himself shared 
in the meal; yet if they who sat down to it were not merely 
guests, but his children or his household, then he might speak 
it, even if he himself did not partake. 


37. Baskets (o7upidas). See on Matt. xiv. 20. 


CHAPTER XVI. 


2. Fair weather (eddia). Colloquial. Looking at the even- 
ing sky, a man says to his neighbor, “Fine weather: ” and in 
the morning (ver. 3), “Storm to-day ” (arepov yeuwov). 


3. Lowering (ctuyvdtwov). The verb means to have a 
gloomy look, Dr. Morison compares the Scotch gloaming or 
glooming. Cranmer, the sky is glooming red. The word is 
used only here and at Mark x. 22, of the young ruler, turning 
from Christ with his face overshadowed with gloom. A. V., 
he was sad. Rev., his countenance fell. 


Ca. XVI-J MATTHEW. 91 


9,10. Note the accurate employment of the two words for 
basket. See on xiv. 20. 


15. Thou art the Christ. Compare on i. 1. Note the 
emphatic and definite force of the article in Peter’s confession, 
and also the emphatic position of the pronoun (00, thou) : “ Thou 
art the anointed, the Son of the God, the living.” 


17. Blessed (uaxdpios). See on ch. v. 3. 


18. Thou art Peter (od ef Ilérpos). Christ responds to 
Peter’s emphatic ¢how with another, equally emphatic. Peter 
says, “ Thou art the Christ.” Christ replies, “ 7; how art 
Peter.” Ilérpos (Peter) is used as a proper name, but without 
losing its meaning as a common noun. The name was bestowed 
on Simon at his first interview with Jesus (John i. 42) under the 
form of its Aramaic equivalent, Cephas. In this passage atten- 
tion is called, not to the giving of the name, but to its meaning. 
In classical Greek the word means a piece of rock, as in Homer, 
of Ajax throwing a stone at Hector (“Tiad,” vii., 270), or of 
Patroclus grasping and hiding in his hand a jagged stone (“ Il- 
jad,” xvi., 734). 


On this rock (él tadtn 1h 7érpa). The word is feminine, 
and means a rock, as distinguished from a stone or a fragment of 
rock (aérpos, above). Used of a ledge of rocks or a rocky peak. 
In Homer (“ Odyssey,” ix., 243), the rock (mérpnv) which Poly- 
phemus places at the door of his cavern, is a mass which two-and- 
twenty wagons could not remove ; and the rock which he hurled 
at the retreating ships of Ulysses, created by its fall a wave in 
the sea which drove the ships back toward the land (“ Odyssey,” 
ix., 484). The word refers neither to Christ as a rock, distin- 
guished from Simon, a stone, nor to Peter's confession, but to 
Peter himself, in a sense defined by his previous confession, 
and as enlightened by the “ Father in Heaven.” 

The reference of mérpa to Christ is forced and unnatural. 
The obvious reference of the word is to Peter. The emphatic 


92 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XVI. 


thes naturally refers to the nearest antecedent; and besides, 
the metaphor is thus weakened, since Christ appears here, not 
as the foundation, but as the architect: “On this rock well I 
build”’ Again, Christ is the great foundation, the “chief 
corner-stone,” but the New Testament writers recognize no 
impropriety in applying to the members of Christ’s church 
certain terms which are applied to him. For instance, Peter 
himself (1 Pet. ii. 4), calls Christ a diwing stone, and, in ver. 5, 
addresses the church as wing stones. In Apoc. xxi. 14, the 
names of the twelve apostles appear in the twelve foundation- 
stones of the heavenly city; and in Eph. ii. 20, it is said, 
“Ye are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets 
(t.e., laad by the apostles and prophets), Jesus Christ himself 
being the chief corner-stone.” 

Equally untenable is the explanation which refers wérpa to 
Simon’s confession. Both the play upon the words and the 
natural reading of the passage are against it, and besides, it 
does not conform to the fact, since the church is built, not on 
confessions, but on confessors—living men. 

“The word sérpa,” says Edersheim, “was used in the same 
sense in Rabbinic language. According to the Rabbins, when 
God was about to build his world, he could not rear it on the 
generation of Enos, nor on that of the flood, who brought 
destruction upon the world; but when he beheld that Abraham 
would arise in the future, he said: ‘Behold, I have found a 
rock to build on it, and to found the world,’ whence, also, 
Abraham is called a rock, as it is said: ‘Look unto the rock 
whence ye are hewn.’ The parallel between Abraham and 
Peter might be carried even further. If, from a misunder- 
standing of the Lord’s promise to Peter, later Christian legend 
represented the apostle as sitting at the gate of heaven, Jewish 
legend represents Abraham as sitting at the gate of Gehenna, 
so as to prevent all who had the seal of circumcision from 
falling into its abyss ” (“Life and Times of Jesus”). 

The reference to Simon himself is confirmed by the actual 
relation of Peter to the eatly church, to the Jewish portion 
of which he was a foundation-stone. See Acts, i. 15; ii. 14, 
37; ii. 125 iv. 8; v. 15, 29; ix. 84, 40; x. 25, 26; Gal. i. 18. 


Cu. XVI] MATTHEW. 93 


Church (éxxcrAnoiav), éx, out, cadréw, to call or summon. This 
is the first occurrence of this word in the New Testament. 
Originally an assembly of citizens, regularly summoned. So in 
New Testament, Acts xix. 39. The Septuagint uses the word 
for the congregation of Israel, either as sammoned for a defi- 
nite purpose (1 Kings viii. 65), or for the community of Israel 
collectively, regarded as a congregation (Gen. xxviii. 3), where 
assembly is given for multitude in margin. In New Testament, 
of the congregation of Israel (Acts vii. 38); but for this there 
is more commonly employed cvvaywyn, of which synagogue is a 
transcription; ovv, together, dyw, to bring (Acts xiii. 43). In 
Christ’s words to Peter the word éx«dnola acquires special em- 
phasis from the opposition implied in it to the synagogue. 
The Christian community in the midst of Israel would be desig- 
nated as éxxAnoia, without being confounded with the ovva- 
yey7, the Jewish community. See Acts v. 11; viii. 1; xii. 1; 
xiv. 23, 27, ete. Nevertheless cuvaywyy is applied to a Chris- 
tian assembly in James ii. 2, while érvcuvaywyn (gathering or 
assembling together) is found in 2 Thess. ii. 1; Heb. x. 25. 
Both in Hebrew and in New Testament usage é«xAnoia im- 
plies more than a collective or national unity; rather a com- 
munity based on a special religious idea and established in a 
special way. In the New Testament the term is used also in 
the narrower sense of a single church, or a church confined to 
a particular place. So of the church in the house of Aquila 
and Priscilla (Rom. xvi. 5); the church at Corinth, the churches 
in Judea, the church at Jerusalem, etc. 


Gates of hell (dda ddov). Rev., Hades. Hades was orig- 
inally the name of the god who presided over the realm of 
the dead—Pluto or Dis. Hence the phrase, house of Hades. 
It is derived from 4, not, and iSetv, to see; and signifies, there- 
fore, the invisible land, the realm of shadow. It is the place 
to which all who depart this life descend, without reference to 
their moral character. 

By this word the Septuagint translated the Hebrew Sheol, 
which has a similar general meaning. The classical Hades em- 
braced both good and bad men, though divided into Alysiwm, 


94 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT, [Cu. XVI. 


the abode of the virtuous, and Zartarus, the abode of the wicked. 
In these particulars it corresponds substantially with Sheol ; 
both the godly and the wicked being represented as gathered 
into the latter. See Gen. xlii. 38; Ps. ix. 17; exxxix. 8; Isa. 
xiv. 9; lvii. 2; Ezek. xxxii. 27; Hos. xiii. 14. Hades and 
Sheol were alike conceived as a definite place, lower than the 
world. The passage of both good and bad into it was regarded 
as a descent. The Hebrew conception is that of a place of 
darkness; a cheerless home of a dull, joyless, shadowy life. 
See Ps. vi. 5; xciv. 17; exv. 17; lxxxviii. 5, 6,10; Job x. 21; 
iii, 17-19; xiv. 10,11; Eccl. ix. 5. Wagueness is its character- 
istic. In this the Hebrew’s faith appears bare in contrast with 
that of the Greek and Roman. The pagan poets gave the 
popular mind definite pictures of Tartarus and Elysium; of 
Styx and Acheron; of happy plains where dead heroes held 
high discourse, and of black abysses where offenders under- 
went strange and ingenious tortures. 

There was, indeed, this difference between the Hebrew and 
the Pagan conceptions ; that to the Pagan, Hades was the final 
home of its tenants, while Sheol was a temporary condition. 
Hence the patriarchs are described (Heb. xi. 16) as looking for 
a better, heavenly country; and the martyrs as enduring in 
hope of “a better resurrection.” Prophecy declared that the 
dead should arise and sing, when Sheol itself should be de- 
stroyed and its inmates brought forth, some to everlasting life, 
and others to shame and contempt (Isa. xxvi. 19 ; Hos. xiii. 14; 
Dan. xii. 2). Paul represents this promise as made to the 
fathers by God, and as the hope of his countrymen (Acts xxvi. 
7). God was the God of the dead as well as of the living ; 
present in the dark chambers of Sheol as well as in heaven (Pe 
exxxix. 8; xvi. 10). This is the underlying thought of that 
most touching and pathetic utterance of Job (xiv. 13--15), in 
which he breathes the wish that God would hide him with 
loving care in Hades, as a place of temporary concealment, 
where he will wait patiently, standing like a sentinel at his 
post, awaiting the divine voice calling him to a new and hap- 
pier life. This, too, is the thought of the familiar and much-dis- 
puted passage, Job xix. 23-27. His Redeemer, vindicator, aven- 


Oa. XVI.) MATTHEW. 95 


ger, shall arise after he shall have passed through the shadowy 
realm of Sheol. ‘A judgment in Hades, in which the judge 
will show himself his friend, in which all the tangled skein of 
his life will be unravelled by wise and kindly hands, and the 
insoluble problem of his strange and self-contradicting ex- 
perience will at last be solved—thzs is what Job still looks for 
on that happy day when he shall see God for himself, and find 
his Goel (vindicator) in that Almighty Deliverer ” (Cox, ‘“ Com- 
mentary on the Book of Job”). 

In the New Testament, Hades is the realm of the dead. It 
cannot be successfully maintained that it is, in particular, the 
place for sinners (so Cremer, “‘ Biblico-Theological Lexicon ”). 
The words about Capernaum (Matt. xi. 23), which it is surpris- 
ing to find Cremer citing in support of this position, are merely 
a rhetorical expression of a fall from the height of earthly 
glory to the deepest degradation, and have no more bearing 
upon the moral character of Hades than the words of Zophar 
(Job xi. 7, 8) about the perfection of the Almighty. “It is 
high as heaven—deeper than Sheol.” Hades is indeed coupled 
with Death (Apoc. i. 18; vi.8; xx. 13, 14), but the association 
is natural, and indeed inevitable, apart from all moral distinc- 
tions. Death would naturally be followed by Hades in any 
ease. In Apoc. xx. 13, 14, the general judgment is predicted, 
and not only Death and Hades, but the sea give up their dead, 
and only those who are not written in the book of life are cast 
into the lake of fire (ver.15). The rich man was in Hades 
(Luke xvi. 23), and im torments, but Lazarus was also in Hades, 
“in Abraham’s bosom.” The details of this story “ evidently 
represent the views current at the time among the Jews. Ac- 
cording to them, the Garden of Eden and the Tree of Life were 
the abode of the blessed. . . . We read that the righteous 
in Eden see the wicked in Gehenna and rejoice; and similarly, 
that the wicked in Gehenna see the righteous sitting beatified 
in Eden, and their souls are troubled (Edersheim, “ Life and 
Times of Jesus”). Christ also was in Hades (Acts ii. 27, 31). 
- Moreover, the word yéevva, hell (see on Matt. v. 22), is specially 
used to denote the place of future punishment. 

Hades, then, in the New Testament, is a broad and general 


96 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XVI. 


conception, with an idea of locality bound up with it. Itis the 
condition following death, which is blessed or the contrary, ac- 
cording to the moral character of the dead, and is therefore 
divided into different realms, represented by Paradise or 
Abraham’s bosom, and Gehenna. 

The expression Gates of Hades is an orientalism for the court, 
throne, power, and dignity of the infernal kingdom. Hades is 
contemplated as a mighty city, with formidable, frowning por- 
tals. Some expositors introduce also the idea of the cowncils of 
the Satanic powers, with reference to the Eastern custom of 
holding such deliberations in the gates of cities. Compare the 
expression Sublime Porte, applied to the Ottoman court. The 
idea of a budding is maintained in both members of the com- 
parison. The kingdom or city of Hades confronts and assaults 
the church which Christ will build upon the rock. See Job 
AUK VIL LG Pex Bs ecvil. lS 5 teat xxxvilit 10: 


19. Keys («deidas). The similitude corresponding to dbudd. 
The church or kingdom is conceived as a house, of which Peter 
is to be the steward, bearing the keys. ‘Even as he had 
been the first to utter the confession of the church, so was he 
also privileged to be the first to open its hitherto closed gates 
to the Gentiles, when God made choice of him, that, through 
his mouth, the Gentiles should first hear the words of the Gos- 
pel, and at his bidding first be baptized ” (Edersheim, “ Life 
and Times of Jesus”). 


Bind—loose (djons—Avons). In a sense common among the 
Jews, of forbidding or allowing. No other terms were in more 
constant use in Rabbinic canon-law than those of binding and 
loosing. They represented the egislative and judicial powers 
of the Rabbinic office. These powers Christ now transferred, 
and that not in their pretension, but in their reality, to his 
apostles; the first, here, to Peter, as their representative, the 
second, after his resurrection, to the church (John xx. 23, Eder- 
sheim). “This legislative authority conferred upon Peter can 
only wear an offensive aspect when it is conceived of as possess- 
ing an arbitrary character, and as being in no way determined 


Cu. XVI.J MATTHEW. 97 


by the ethical influences of the Holy Spirit, and when it is re- 
garded as being of an absolute nature, as independent of any 
connection with the rest of the apostles. Since the power of 
binding and loosing, which is here conferred upon Peter, is 
ascribed (Matt. xviii. 18) to the apostles generally, the power con- 
ferred upon the former is set in its proper light, and shown to 
be of necessity a power of a collegiate nature, so that Peter is 
not to be regarded as exclusively endowed with it, either in whole 
or in part, but is simply to be looked upon as first among his 
equals ”’ (Meyer on Matt. xvi. 19; xviii. 18). 


21. From that time began (azo rote jp£aro). He had not 
shown it to them before. 


Must (de2). It was necessary in fulfilment of the divine pur- 
pose. See Matt. xxvi. 54; Heb. viii. 3; Luke xxiv. 26. 


Suffer. This first announcement mentions his passion and 
death generally ; the second (xvii. 22, 23), adds his betrayal into 
the hands of sinners; the third (xx. 17-19), at length expresses 
his stripes, cross, etc. 


Elders and chief priests and scribes. A circumstantial 
way of designating the Sanhedrim, or supreme council of the 
Jewish nation. 


22. Took (rpocraBdpuevos). Not, took him by the hand, but 
took him apart to speak with him prwately. Meyer renders, 
correctly, after he had taken him to himself. “ As if,” says 
Bengel, “ by a right of his own. He acted with greater famil- 
iarity after the token of acknowledgment had been given. 
Jesus, however, reduces him to his level.” 


Began. For Jesus did not suffer him to continue. 


Be it far from thee (trews oo.) Rev.,in margin, God have 
mercy on thee. In classical usage, of the gods as propitious, 
gracious toward men, in consideration of their prayers and sac- 
rifices. The meaning here is, may God be gracious to thee.

98 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XVI. 


Shall not be (ov yu gota). The double negative is very 
forcible: ‘Shall anno case be.” Rev. renders it by never. 


23. Turned (otpadgels). Not toward Peter, but away from 
him. 


Get thee behind me. See iv. 10. 


Offence (cxavdanrov). Rev., better, stwmbling-block. See 
on v. 29. Not, thow art offenswe, but thou art m my way. 
Dr. Morison, ‘“ Thou art not, as before, a noble block, lying in 
its right position as a massive foundation-stone. On the con- 
trary, thou art like a stone quite out of its proper place, and 
lying right across the road in which I must go—lying as a stone 
of stumbling.” 


Savourest not (ov dpoveis). Rev., better, mendest not. Thy 
thoughts and intents are not of God, but of men. Savowrest 
follows the Vulgate sapzs, from sapere, which means 1st, to have 
a taste or flavor of : 2d, to have sense or discernment. Hence 
used here as the rendering of dpoveiv, to be minded. Thus 
Wye., 1 Cor. xiii., 11, “When I was a child I savoured (éppo- 
vouv) asa child.” The idea is, strictly, to partake of the quality 
or nature of. 


26. Gain—lose (xepdnon—lCnutwdy). Note that both words 
are in the past (aorist) tense: “¢fhe may have gained or lost. 
The Lord looks back to the details of each life as the factors of 
the final sum of gain or loss. For dose, Rev. gives forfeit. The 
verb in the active voice means to cause loss or damage. Often 
in the classics, of jiming or mulcting in a sum of money. 
Compare 2 Cor. vii. 9. 


Soul (ruy7v) Rev., life, with soul in margin. This will be 
specially considered in the discussion of the psychological 


terms in the Epistles. 


In exchange (avrdddayua). Lit., as an exchange. | 


Cu. XVII] MATTHEW. 99 


CHAPTER XVII. 


1. Taketh (apadapyB8dve). Rev. gives the force of the 
preposition zrapd, taketh wth him. 


Apart (ca7’ idiav). Not said of the mountain, as isolated, but 
of the disciples ; so that they might be alone with him. Com- 
pare Mark ix. 2, apart by themselves (kar’ iiay povovs: lit., 
apart alone). 


2. He was transfigured (werewopdodn), werd, denoting 
change or transfer, and popdy, form. This latter word denotes 
the form regarded as the distinctive nature and character of 
the object, and is distinguished from oyjjpa, the changeable, 
outward fashion : in a man, for instance, his gestures, clothes, 
words, acts. The popdy partakes of the essence of a thing; 
the oxfja is an accident which may change, leaving the form 
unaffected. Compare Mark xvi. 12; Christ ‘appeared in another 
form” (wopdy4), and 1 Cor. vii. 831: “the fashion (oxjpa) of 
the world passeth away.” The distinction passes into the verbs 
compounded with these two nouns. Thus, Rom. xii. 2, “Be 
not conformed to this world,” is wa cvoynuatiferSe ; w.¢., be 
not fashioned according to the fleeting fashion of this world. 
So Rev., fashioned. See, also, 2 Cor. xi. 13, 14, 15, where the 
changes described are changes in outward semblance. False 
apostles appeared in the outward fashion of apostles of Christ ; 
Satan takes on the outward appearance of an angel. All these 
changes are in the accidents of the life, and do not touch its 
inner, essential guality. On the other hand, a change in the 
inner life is described as a change of popdy, never of cxjpa. 
Hence, Rom. xii. 2, “ Be ye transformed (werapoppodade) ; the 
change taking place by the renewing of the mend. Com- 
pare Rom. viii. 29; 2 Cor. iii. 18; Philip. iii. 21; and see, fur- 

ther, on Philip. ii. 6, 7. 

' Why, then, it may be asked, is a compound of pop¢7# em- 
ployed in this description of the transfigured Saviour, since the 
change described is a change in his outward appearance? It 


100 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.  ([Cu. XVIL 


may be answered, because a compound of cxjua, expressing 
merely a change in the aspect of Christ’s person and garments, 
would not express the deeper truth of the case, which is, that 
the visible change gets its real character and meaning from that 
which is essential in our Lord—his divine nature. A fore- 
shadowing or prophecy of his true form—his distinctive char- 
acter—comes out in his transfiguration. He passes over into a 
form identified, so far as revealed, with the divine quality of 
his being, and prophetic of his revelation “as he is” (1 John 
iii. 2), in the glory which he had with the Father before the 
world was (John xvii. 5). In truth, there is a deep and preg- 
nant hint in the use of this word, which easily escapes ob- 
servation, and which defies accurate definition. The profound 
and overwhelming impression upon the three disciples was due 
to something besides the shining of Christ’s face and garments, 
and the presence of Moses and Elijah; and was deeper and 
subtler than the effect of all these combined. There was a 
fact and a power in that vision which mere radiance and the 
appearance of the dead patriarchs could not wholly convey: 
a revelation of Deity breaking out in that glorified face and 
form, which appealed to something deeper than sense, and 
confirmed the words from heaven: This zs my beloved Son. 

The same truth is illustrated in the use of wopd) in Mark 
xvi. 12, where it is said that Jesus appeared in a different form 
(év érépa woppy) after his resurrection. The accidents of figure, 
face, pierced hands and feet, were the same; but an indefin- 
able change had passed upon him, the characteristic of which 
was that it prefigured his passing into the condition peculiar 
and appropriate to his essential spiritual and divine being. 


4, Let us make (croujowpev). But the best texts read, 
touaow, I will make, which is more characteristic of Peter. He 
would erect the booths himself. 


Three tabernacles (oxnvds). Tents or booths, out of the 
brushwood lying near. Peter realized that it was night, and 
was for preparing shelters into which the heavenly visitants 
might retire after their interview. 


Ox, XVII] MATTHEW. 101 
9. Vision (6paua). The spectacle. 


11. Cometh. Elijah cometh first. An abstract statement 
expressing the fact that Elijah’s coming precedes in time the com- 
ing of the Messiah. It is a point of Jewish chronology ; just 
as a teacher of history might say to his pupils, “The Saxons 
and Danes precede the Normans in England.” Elijah had al- 
ready come in the person of John the Baptist. 


15. Is lunatic (cernvidferar). Rev., epileptic. The A. V. 
preserves the etymology of the word (cedjvn, the moon), but 
lunatic conveys to us the idea of demented; while the Rev. 
epileptic gives the true character of the disease, yet does not 
tell us the fact contained in the Greek word, that epilepsy was 
supposed to be affected by the changes of the moon. See on 
Matt. iv. 24. 


17. Perverse (Suectpaypévn). Wyc., wayward. Tynd., 
crooked ; dia, throughout ; otpépa, to turst. Warped. 


20. Unbelief (amicriav). But the better reading is oduyo- 
muatiav, littleness of faith. Hence Rev., Because of your little 
Suth. 


24. They that received tribute-money (oi ra didpaypa 
AawBavovtes). Rev., They that received the half-shekel. Every 
male Israelite of age, including proselytes and manumitted 
Jews, was expected to pay annually for the temple-service a 
half-shekel or didrachm, about thirty-five cents. This must be 
paid in the ancient money of Israel, the regular half-shekel of 
the treasury ; and the money-changers, therefore, were in de- 
mand to change the current into the temple coin, which they 
did at a rate of discount fixed by law, between four and five 
cents on every half-shekel. The annual revenue to the money- 
changers from this source has been estimated at nearly forty- 
~ five thousand dollars; a very large sum in a country where a 
Jaborer received less than twenty cents for a day’s work, and 
where the good Samaritan left about thirty-three cents at the 


102 WORD STUDIES Ib) THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca XVIL 


inn for the keeping of the wounded man. Jesus attacked a 
very powerful interest when he overthrew the tables of the 
money-changers. 


25. Yes (vai). Indicating that Jesus had paid the tax on 
former occasions. 


Prevented (poépSacev). Rev., rather awkwardly, but fol- 
lowing Tynd., Spake jirst to him. Prevent, in its older sense, 
to anticipate, get before, was a correct translation. Compare 
Shakspeare : 


‘¢So shall my anticipation prevent your discovery.” 
Hamlet, ii., 1. 


Out of this grew the secondary meaning, to hinder. By getting 
before another, one hinders him from accomplishing his pur- 
pose. This meaning has supplanted the other. Wye. renders 
came before him. The meaning is that Jesus did not wait for 
Peter to tell him of the demand of the collectors. He antzc- 
pated him in speaking about it. 


Custom or tribute (TtéAn 7 xfvoov). Rev. gives toll for 
custom. Toll is duty upon goods; tribute, tax upon individ- 
uals. Kvoos, tribute, is merely a transcription of the Latin 
census, which means, first, a registration with a view to taxa- 
tion, and then the tax itself. 


Strangers (a\Xotpiov). Not forergners, but others than 
those of their own families; their subjects. In other words, 
Does a king tax his own children or his subjects ? 


27. Hook (dyxiotpov). The only mention in the New Testa- 
ment of fishing with a hook. A single fish is wanted. 


A piece of money (crtarfjpa). The A. V. is very inade- 
quate, because Christ names a definite sum, the stater, which is 
a literal transcription of the Greek word, and represents two 
didrachmas, or a shekel. Hence Rev., a shekel. 


Cu. XVII] MATTHEW. 103

1. The Rev. inserts then after who, thus restoring the Greek 
dpa, which the A. V. overlooks. Who then? Who, as things 
stand. Since one of our number has been doubly honored in 
being called “the rock,” and in being appointed to take part in 
a special miracle, who then is greatest? 


3. Be converted (ctpagfjre). The word converted has ac- 
quired a conventional religious sense which is fundamentally 
truthful, but the essential quality of which will be more appa- 
rent if we render literally, as Rev., except ye turn. The pict- 
ure is that of turning round in a road and facing the other 
way. 


Shall not enter (ov 47 eicéXIn7e). But the double nega- 
tive is very forcible, and is given in Rev. in nowise. So far 
from being greatest in the kingdom of heaven, ye shall not so 
much as enter. 


4. As this little child. Not, as this little child hwmbles 
himself, but, shall make himself humble as this little child 2s 
lowly; shall willingly become by spiritual process what the 
child is by nature. 


5. Inmy name (él to dvopuari pov). Lit., won my name ; 
on the ground of, or onaccount of ; for my sake. 


6. A millstone (vrs dvixds). Two kinds of millstones 
were in use; the one turned by hand, the other, and larger, by 
an ass (dvos). Here Jesus says an ass-millstone; or, as Rev., 
a great millstone ; Wyc., millstone of asses.

12. Leave upon the mountains. The text here is dis- 
puted. Both A. V. and Rey. follow a text which reads: 
“ Doth he not, leaving the ninety and nine, go into the moun- 
tains?” Rather join leave with on the mountains, and read, 
“Will he not leave the ninety and nine upon (éml, scattered 
over) the mountains, and go,” etc. This also corresponds with 
adnaoet, leaving, letting out, or letting loose. 


13. If so be (eav yévnrar). If it should so come to pass. 
God’s grace is not irresistible. 


14. The will of your Father (9éAnpia. EurrpooSev Tod maTpos 
iuav). Though some read my Father (wod). Lit., There is not 
a will before your (my) Father. So Wye., It is not will before 
your Father. Meyer paraphrases, There is not before the face 
of God any determination having as its object that one of these,

15. Go (éaye). Do not wait for him to come to you. 


Tell him his fault (€\ey£ov). Rev., shew him. The verb 
means, first, to test, try, search out ; therefore, to cross-examine 
with a view of convincing or refuting; thence to rebuke or 
chide. The Rev. shew is better than ¢e//, which implies merely 
naming the fault; whereas the injunction is, go and prove to 
him how he has erred. Wye., reprove, with snub as explanation. 


16. Inthe mouth (ézi orouaros). Better Rev., “at the 
mouth,” or on the testimony of. 


19. Shall agree (cupgavycovew). From ovr, together, and 
gavn, sound or voice. ‘Transcribed in our word symphony. 
It has so far lost its distinctive character as a concord of worces 
as to be used for agreement in the deeper and more inward 
sense. 


Concerning anything that they shall ask (7epi wavros

thing, stronger: Everything, whatever it be, for which they may 
have asked. Wyc., Shall consent of everything whatever they 
shall ask. Tynd., Shall agree in any manner thing whatsoever 
they shall desire. The word mpayya, thing, is used like the 
Latin res ; a matter, affair, business, with the meaning at bot- 
tom of something to be done, since it is cognate to the verb Tpac- 
ow, to do. Shall be done, however, is yevijoerar, it shall come to 
pass. 


20. In my name (eis 7d wov dvowa). Lit., “into my name.” 
When two or three are drawn together into Christ as the com- 
mon centre of their desire and faith. 


22. Seventy times seven (EBdounnovrdnis érrd).* It was 
a settled rule of Rabbinism that forgiveness should not be ex- 
tended more than three times. Even so, the practice was terri- 
bly different. The Talmud relates, without blame, the conduct 
of a rabbi who would not forgive a very small slight of his dig- 
nity, though asked by the offender for thirteen successive years, 
and that on the day of atonement; the reason being that the 
offended rabbi had learned by a dream that his offending 
brother would attain the highest dignity ; whereupon he feigned 
himself irreconcilable, to force the other to migrate from Pales- 
tine to Babylon, where, unenvied by him, he might occupy the 
chief place (Edersheim). It must, therefore, have seemed to 
Peter a stretch of charity to extend forgiveness from three to 
seven times. Christ is not specifying a number of times greater 
than the limit of seven. He means that there is to be no limit. 
“ Forgiveness is gualitative, not quantitative.” 





*It is uncertain whether this means four hundred and ninety times, or 
seventy-seven times. Those who maintain the latter, claim that the expres- 
sion is derived from the Septuagint, Gen. iv., 24. Authorities, however, do 
not agree on the rendering of the Hebrew in that passage. Meyer says it can- 
not possibly mean anything else than seventy-seven, while Bunsen renders 
seven times seventy, and Grotius septwagies et id ipsum septies, ‘‘ seventy times 
and that seven times over.” The point, however, is unimportant, for, as Dr. 
Morison observes, ‘‘So far as the spirit of our Saviour’s answer is concerned, 
both enumerations are right.”

93. A certain king (dv9pdémr@ Bactre?). Lit., a man, aking. 
The kingdom of heaven is like unto a human king. 


Take account of his servants (cuvdpas Noyov peta Tav Sov- 
Awv aitod). The rendering of the A. V. is loose and inadequate, 
and might be taken to mean to reckon the number of his ser- 
vants. Theverb cvvapa is compounded of ctv, with, and aipe, 
to take wp, and means literally to take up together, 2.c., cast up, 
as an account. The A. V. also overlooks the force of pera, 
with. Therefore, Rev., better, make a reckoning with his ser- 
vants. 


24. Which owed him (ddecrérns). Lit., a debtor of ten 
thousand talents. 


Ten thousand talents. An enormous sum; about twelve 
millions of dollars. 


25. To be sold. According to the law of Moses: Ex. xxii. 
8; Lev. xxv. 39, 47. 


28. Found. Either went in search of him, as he himself 
had been sought out by his lord, or came upon him accidentally 
in the street. 


A hundred pence (éxarév dnvdpia). Less than a millionth 
part of his own debt. 


Took him by the throat (adrov évyev). Lit., throttled. 
Wyc., strangled. Compare were choked, Mark v. 13. Credit- 
ors often dragged their debtors before the judge, as the Roman 
law allowed them to do, holding them by the throat. Thus 
Livy (iv. 538), relates how, a difficulty having arisen between the 
consul Valerius and one Menenius, the tribunes put an end to 
the contest, and the consul ordered into prison (collum torsisset, 
twisted the neck) the few who appealed. And Cicero (“Pro 
Cluentio,” xxi.): “Lead him to the judgment-seat with twisted 
neck (collo obtorto).” Compare Cicero, “In C. Verrem,” iv., 10. 


Cu. XTX.) MATTHEW. 107 


What thou owest (ci rz dgetdevs). Lit., Jf thow owest any: 
thing. Not that the creditor is uncertain about the fact of the 
debt, though some uncertainty about the exact amount may be 
implied. This would agree with found, in the sense of coming 
upon accidentally. Compare Matt. xiii. 44. He came suddenly 
upon him and recognized him as a debtor, though not certain 
as to the amount of his debt. Meyer remarks, “ The ¢f is sim- 
ply the expression of a pitiless logic. If thou owest anything 
(as thou dost) pay!” The word pay (amédos) is emphatic in 
position. 


29. Besought (rapexddex). The imperfect has the force of 
earnestly besought. 


30. Went (aed Sov). Lit. went away: dragging the other 
with him to judgment. 


31. Told (dvecdpnoav). More than merely narrated. The 
verb is from 6:4, throughout, and cadéw, to explain. They ex- 
plained the circumstances throughout. 


Their Lord (76 xupio éavrav). Lit., “their own Lord ;” as 
befitted their position, and as a mark of their confidence in 
him. 


34. To the tormentors (Sacaworais). Livy pictures an 
old centurion complaining that he was taken by his creditor, 
not into servitude, but to a workhouse and torture, and show- 
ing his back scarred with fresh wounds (ii., 23). 


CHAPTER XIX. 


1. Coasts (épia). Better Rev., borders ; though it is easy to 
see how the translation coasts arose, coast being derived from 
the Latin costa, a side, and hence a border generally, though 
now applied to the sea-side only. 


3. Tempting. See on Matt. vi. 13. 


108 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu XIX. 


For every cause. The ¢emptaiion turned upon the dispute 
dividing the two great Rabbinical schools, the one of which 
(that of Hillel) held that a man might divorce his wife for any 
reason which rendered her distasteful to him; and the other 
(that of Shammai) that divorce was allowable only in case of un- 
chastity. The querists would be anxious to know which side 
Jesus espoused. 


5. Shall cleave (coAdnIncera). Lit., shall be glued. 


Shall be one flesh (écovrau cis cdpxa wiav). Lit. “into 
one flesh;” Wye., two im one flesh. 


6. What (6). Not those. Christ is contemplating, not the 
indwiduals, but the unity which God cemented ; and so Wyc., 
that thing that God enjoined ; i.e. knit together. The aorist 
tense (denoting the occurrence of an event at some past time, 
considered as a momentary act) seems to refer to the original 
ordinance of God at the creation (ver. 4), 


7. Writing (@:BAlov). Rev., dU. The word is a diminutive 
of BiPros, which originally means the inner bark of the papy- 
rus, used for writing, then a book or rol] of this bark ; hence 
a paper, bill. 


8. Because of (zpos). Rev., for: having regard to. 


It was not so (ov yéyovev obrws). The A. V. is commonly 
understood to mean, z# was not so in the beginning. But that is 
not Christ’s meaning. The verb is in the perfect tense (denot- 
ing the continuance of past action or its results down to the 
present). He means: Notwithstanding Moses’ permission, the 
case has not been so from the beginning until now. The origi- 
nal ordinance has never been abrogated nor superseded, but con. 
tinues in force. 


9. Except for fornication (ui) émi Twopveia). Lit., not on 
account of fornication. 


Cu. XIX.] MATTHEW. 109 


10. The case (airia). Not the relation of the man to his 
wife, nor the circumstances, the state of the case. Airia refers to 
cause (ver. 3), and the meaning is, if the matter stands thus 
with reference to the cause which the man must have for put- 
ting away his wife. 


14. Suffer (ddere). Lit., leave alone. Compare Mark xiv. 
6; xv. 386; Luke xiii. 8. Sir J. Cheke: Let these children 
alone. 


17. Why callest thou me good ? (ri we Aéyers aya-90r). 
But the true reading is, r/ we épwrds epi tod ayadtod; Why 
askest thou me concerning the good ? 


There is none good but one, that is God (ovdels ayados ef 
pn) els 6 Meds). But the reading is, efs éativ 0 ayados, One there 
is who is good. The saying of Christ appears especially appro- 
priate in the light of the Rabbinic apothegm, ‘“ There is noth- 
ing else that is good but the law.” 


24. Camel — through a needle’s eye (kdunrov did 
TpuTnuwatos padpibos). See on Mark x. 25; Luke xviii. 25. 
Compare the Jewish proverb, that a man did not even in his 
dreams see an elephant pass through the eye of a needle. 
The reason why the camel was substituted for the elephant 
was because the proverb was from the Babylonian Talmud, 
and in Babylon the elephant was common, while in Palestine 
it was unknown. The Koran has the same figure: ‘‘ The im- 
pious shall find the gates of heaven shut; nor shall he enter 
there till a camel shall pass through the eye of a needle.” Bo- 
chart, in his history of the animals of scripture, cites a Talmu- 
dic passage: ‘‘ A needle’s eye is not too narrow for two friends, 
nor is the world wide enough for two enemies.” The allusion 
is not to be explained by reference to a narrow gate called a 
necdle’s eye. 


26. This (rodro). Not the salvation of 72ch men, but salva- 
tion in general. It is in answer to the question, who can be 


110 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XX, 


saved ? Man cannot save himself nor his fellow. God only 
can save him. 


27. We. Emphatic, in contrast with the young ruler. 


28. Have followed. “Peter had said together the words 
we have left, we have followed. Jesus replies to them sepa- 
rately ; for the latter was peculiar to the apostles, the former 
common to them with others” (Bengel). 


In the regeneration. The final restitution of all things. 
To be construed with ye shall sit. 


Shall sit (ca9icy). Or shall have taken his seat, which 
brings out more vividly the solemn inauguration of Christ’s 
judgment. 


29. Every one (7s). Compare 2 Tim. iv. 8, “to adi them 
that love his appearing.” “Not only apostles, nor ought Peter 
to have inquired only concerning them ” (Bengel). The promise 
hitherto restricted to the apostles now becomes general. 


A hundred-fold (exatovrarAaciova). But many very high 
authorities read ro\Aamdactova, manifold. So Rev. in mar- 
gin. Compare Mark x. 30, where there is added “houses and 
brethren,” etc. Also the Arabic proverb: “ Purchase the next 
world with this ; so shalt thou win both.” 


CHAPTER XX. 
1. For (ydp). Explaining and confirming xix. 30. 


Early in the morning (dua mpi). Along with the dawn. 
“ Here (at Hamadan, in Persia), we observed every morning, 
before the sun rose, that a numerous band of peasants were 
collected, with spades in their hands, waiting to be hired for the 
day to work in the surrounding fields. This custom struck me 
as a most happy illustration of our Saviour’s parable, particularly 


One ex MATTHEW. 11] 


when, passing by the same place late in the day, we found 
others standing idle, and remembered his words, ‘ Why stand 
ye here all the day idle ?’ as most applicable to their situation ; 
for on putting the very same question to them, they answered 
us, ‘ Because no man hath hired us.’” (Morier, “Second Jour- 
ney through Persia,” cited by Trench, “ Parables. ”) 


2. For a penny (é« Snvapiov). A denarius, the chief silver 
coin of the Romans at this time, and of the value of about 
seventeen cents. We must remember to reckon according to 
the rate of wages in that day. A denarius was regarded as 
good pay for a day’s work. It was the pay of a Roman sol- 
dier in Christ’s time. In almost every case where the word 
occurs in the New Testament it is connected with the idea of a 
liberal or large amount. Compare Matt. xviii. 28 ; Mark vi. 37; 
Luke vii. 41; John xii. 5. 

For a penny is, literally, out of or on the strength of a penny ; 
the payment being that on the strength of which the agreement 
was made. The agreement arose out of the demand on the one 
hand and the promise on the other. 


10. Every man a penny (70 dva Snvdpiov). Lit., the swm 
amounting in each case to a penny ; or a penny apiece. ’Ava is 
distributive. Wyc., each one by himself a penny. 


12. Heat (kavcwva). Rev., the scorching heat. The word is 
from kaiw, to burn. It refers to the dry, scorching heat borne 
by the east wind. Compare Job xxvii. 21; Hos. xiii. 15. The 
wind blows from the Arabian desert, parching, dry, exciting 
the blood, and causing restlessness and sleeplessness. It seldom 
brings storms, but when it does, they are doubly destructive. 
During harvest the corn cannot be winnowed if the east wind 
blows, for it would carry away both chaff and corn. In 
Pharaoh’s dream (Gen. xli. 6) the ears are blasted by it: 
Jonah’s gourd is withered by it (Jon. iv. 8), and the vine in 
Ezekiel’s parable of the Babylonian captivity is blighted by it 
(Ezek. xvii. 10). 


13. One. Representing the whole body. 


112 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cn. AX 
Friend (éraipe). Lit., companion, comrade. 


14. Take (Gpov). Lit., as Rev., cake up, as if the money had 
been laid down for him on a table or counter. 


I will give (9é\w Sodva:). But, as in other cases in the A. 
V., this may be mistaken for the simple future of the verb ; 
whereas there are two verbs. Therefore, Rev., rightly, /¢ a 
my will to gwe. See on Matt. xv. 32. 


21. Grant (eiwé). Lit., speak; ¢.¢., with authority. Com- 
pare “command these stones,” Matt. iv. 3; ‘bid you,” Matt. 
xxili. 8. Rev., command. 


26. Will be great (SéAy eivar). See on ver. 14. Rev. would 
be. 


Minister (Sudxovos). Servant, ver. 27 (SotAos). Aovdros, per- 
haps from dé, to bind, is the bondman, representing the per- 
manent relation of servitude. Aidxovos, probably from the 
same root as duwxw, to pursue, represents a servant, not in his 
relation, but in his actwwity. The term covers both slaves and 
hired servants. The attendants at the feast at Cana (John ii. 
5) are called dudxovor. In the epistles d:dKovos is often used 
specifically for a minister of the Gospel (1 Cor. iii. 5; 2 Cor. iii. 
6; Eph. iii. 7). The word deacon is, moreover, almost a tran- 
scription of it (Philip. i. 1; 1 Tim. ili. 8, 12). It is applied to 
Phoebe (Rom. xvi. 1). 


28. A ransom for many. Compare Sophocles, “ Oed. Col.,” 
488, 
‘* For one soul working in the strength of love 
Is mightier than ten thousand to atone.” 


30. That Jesus passed by (d7u’Inoods rapdyet). The 8rt is 
equivalent to quotation marks. They heard the crowd cry 
Jesus 1s passing ! 


Cu. XXL] MATTHEW. 113 


CHAPTER XX. 
1. Bethphage. House of figs. 


2. A colt with her. The Lord does not separate the colt 
from its dam. 


3. The Lord (0 «dpios). From xipos, supreme power, wu- 
thority. Hence kvpsos, one having authority, lord, owner, ruler. 
In classical Greek, used of the gods, and in inscriptions applied 
to different gods, as Hermes, Zeus, etc. ; also of the head'of the 
family, who is lord («vpwos) of the wife and children (1 Sam. i. 
8, Sept.); while to the slaves he is Seomdrys. In the Pauline 
writings, however, the master of slaves is called both Seomérns 
(1 Tim. vi. 1,2; Tit. ii. 9; 1 Pet. ii. 18), and «dpsos (Eph. vi. 
95+ Cols tysil). 

In the Septuagint it is used by Sarah of her husband (Gen. 
Xvill. 12; compare 1 Pet. iii. 6). Joseph is called lord of the 
country (Gen. xlii. 33), and is addressed by his brethren as my 
lord (xiii. 10). It is applied to God (Gen. xviii. 27; Ex. iv. 10). 
In the New Testament it is a name for God (Matt. i. 20, 
22,24; 11.15; Acts xi.16; xii. 11,17; Apoc.i. 8). Asapplied 
to Christ, it does not express his divine nature and power. 
These are indicated by some accompanying word or phrase, as 
my God (John xx. 28); of all (Acts x. 36); to the glory of God 
the Father (Philip. ii. 11) ; of glory (1 Cor. ii. 8); so that, as a 
title of Christ, Zord is used in the sense of Master or Ruler, 
or in address, Siv (Matt. xxii. 48, 45; Luke ii. 11; vi. 46; John 
xili. 13, 14; 1 Cor. viii. 6). ‘“O xvpws, the Lord, is used of 
Christ by Matthew only once (xxi. 3) until after the resurrec- 
tion (xxviii. 6). In the other gospels and in the Acts it occurs 
far oftener. Nevertheless, in the progress of Christian thought 
in the New Testament, the meaning develops toward a specific 
designation of the divine Saviour, as may be seen in the phrases 
Jesus Christ our Lord, Our Lord Jesus Christ, Our Lord, 
Jesus our Lord.

5. Daughter of Sion. Jerusalem. Compare daughter of 
Babylon for the city of Babylon (Ps. cxxxvii. 8; Isa. xlvii. 1) ; 
daughter of Tyre for the city or people of Tyre (Ps. xlv. 12) ; 
daughter of my people (Isa. xxii. 4). 


Sitting (émBeSnKas). Lit., having gone upon, or mounted. 
Rev., ding. 


Foal of an ass (vidy brofuyiov). Lit., son of a beast-of -burden. 
‘Trofiyvov, from bd, beneath, Cuyds, @ yoke. Wye., son of a 
beast-under-yoke. The phrase emphasizes the humble state of 
Jesus. He is mounted, not ona stately charger with embroid- 
ered and jewelled housings, nor even on an ass for the saddle, 
the Eastern ass being often of great beauty and spirit, and in 
demand for this purpose. He rides on a common beast-of-bur- 
den, furnished with the every-day garments of his disciples. 


Garments (iudria). Outer garments. See on Matt. v. 40. 


7. Set him thereon. But the preferable reading is ézrexd- 
Sicev, he took lis seat upon. 


A very great multitude (6 mreloros dynos). The A. V. is 
wrong. The reference is not to the size, but to the propor- 
tionate part of the multitude which followed him. Hence Rey., 
correctly, The most part of the multitude. 


Their garments (éavrév). Lit., “their own garments.” The 
disciples spread their garments on the beasts; the multitude 
strewed their own garments in the way. Dr. Edward Robin- 
son, cited by Dr. Morison, speaking of the inhabitants of Beth- 
lehem who had participated in the rebellion of 1834, says: “ At 
that time, when some of the inhabitants were already im- 
prisoned, and all were in deep distress, Mr. Farrar, then Eng- 
lish consul at Damascus, was on a visit to J erusalem, and had 
rode out with Mr. Nicolayson to Solomon’s Pools. On their 
return, as they rose the ascent to enter Bethlehem, hundreds of 
people, male and female, met them, imploring the consul to in- 


Car xxt} MATTHEW. 115 


terfere in their behalf, and afford them his protection; and all 
at once, by a sort of simultaneous movement, they spread their 
garments in the way before the horses.” 

The variation of tenses is not preserved in the English ver- 
sions. Spread their garments, aorist tense, denoting one defi- 
nite act. Cut down, spread in the way, imperfects, denoting 
continued action. As Jesus advanced, they kept cutting branches 
and spreading them, and the multitude kept crying. 


9. Hosanna. O save! 


10. Was moved (éce/cSm). Moved is hardly strong enough. 
It is shaken as by an earthquake.  Rev., stirved. As Morison 
happily observes, “a profounder ground-swell of feeling.” 


12. The money-changers («orArAvGicrav). From K6rrufos, 
the rate of exchange. These changers sat in the temple, in the 
court of the Gentiles, to change the foreign coins of pilgrims 
into the shekel of the sanctuary for payment of the annual 
tribute. See on Matt. xvii. 24. 


13. Thieves (Ayjotadv). Rev., correctly, robbers. See on Matt. 
xxvi. 55; Luke x. 30. 


16. Say (Aéyouow). The Rev. is more graphic, are saying. 
While the songs and shouts are rising, the priests turn angrily 
to Christ with the question, “Hearest thou what these are 
saying ?” 


Thou hast perfected (xarnptlcw). The same word as at 
Matt. iv. 21, where it is used of adjusting or mending nets. Its 
secondary meaning is to furnish completely, equip ; hence to 
perfect. Thou hast provided the perfection of praise. The quo- 
tation from Ps. viii. 2, follows the Septuagint, and not the 
Hebrew, which is, “Thou hast founded strength.” 


19. A fig-tree (cuxjv piav). Lit., one single fig-tree. Rev., 
in margin. 


116 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. ([Cu. XXL 


Presently (capayphua). Presently, in popular speech, has 
acquired something of a future force. I will do such a thing 
presently means, I will do it, not immediately, but soon. The 
rendering here was correct in the older English sense of 7- 
stantly. So constantly in Shakspeare : 


‘“PROSPERO. Go, bring the rabble, 
O’er whom I gave thee pow’r, here, to this place. 
ARIEL. Presently ? 
Pros. Ay, with a twink. 
Ar. Before you can say ‘come,’ and ‘go,’

away ?” Rev. 


29. Repented (uerapernSels). This is a different word from 
that in Matt. ili. 2; iv. 17; petavoeire, Repent ye. Though it 
is fairly claimed that the word here implies all that is implied 
in the other word, the New Testament writers evidently recog- 
nize a distinction, since the noun which corresponds to the verb 
in this passage (wetayédeva) is not used at all in the New Testa- 
ment, and the verb itself only five times; and, in every case except 
the two in this passage (see ver. 82), with a meaning quite foreign 
to repentance in the ordinary gospel sense. Thus it is used of 
Judas, when he brought back the thirty pieces (Matt. xxvii. 
3); of Paul’s not regretting his letter to the Corinthians (2 
Cor. vii. 8); and of God (Heb. vii. 21). On the other hand, 
Hetavoéw, repent, used by John and Jesus in their summons to 
repentance (Matt. ili. 2; iv. 17), occurs thirty-four times, and the 
noun petdvora, repentance (Matt. iii. 8, 11), twenty-four times 
and in every case with reference to that change of heart and fife 
wrought by the Spirit of God, to which remission of sins and 
salvation are promised. It is not impossible, therefore, that 
the word in this passage may have been intended to carry a 
different shade of meaning, now lost to us. Merapérouan, as its 
etymology indicates (uerd, after, and péro, to be an object 0 
care), implies an after-care, as contrasted with the change of 


Cu. XXL] MATTHEW. 117 


mind denoted by petdvora. Not sorrow for moral obliquity 
and sin against God, but annoyance at the consequences of an 
act or course of acts, and chagrin at not having known better. 
“Tt may be simply what our fathers were wont to call hadzwist 
(had-I-wist, or known better, I should have acted otherwise) ” 
(Trench). Merapédeva refers chiefly to single acts ; weravova de- 
notes the repentance which affects the whole life. Hence the . 
latter is often found in the imperative: Repent ye (Matt. iii. 2; 
iv. 17; Acts ii. 88; iii. 19); the former never. Paul’s recog- 
nition of the distinction (2 Cor. vii. 10) is noteworthy. “Godly 
sorrow worketh repentance (wetdvotav) unto salvation,” a salva- 
tion or repentance “which bringeth no regret on thinking of 
it afterwards” (dywetauwéAnrov). There is no occasion for one ever 
to think better of either his repentance or the salvation in which 
it issued. 


33. Hedged it round about (dpayyov adtd sreptédnxer), 
Rev., more literally, seta hedge about tt ; possibly of the thorny 
wild aloe, common in the East. 


Digged a wine-press (apufev Anvov). In Isa. v. 1, 2, which 
this parable at once recalls, the Hebrew word rendered by the 
Septuagint and here digged, is hewed out, i.e., from the solid 
rock. ‘ Above the road on our left are the outlines of a wine- 
fat, one of the most complete and best preserved in the coun- 
try. Here is the upper basin where the grapes were trodden 
and pressed. A narrow channel cut in the rock conveyed the 
juice into the lower basin, where it was allowed to settle; from 
there it was drawn off into a third and smaller basin. There 
is no mistaking the purpose for which those basins were ex- 
cavated in the solid rock ” (Thomson, “Land and Book”), 


A tower (vpyov). For watchmen. Stanley (“Sinai and 
Palestine”) describes the ruins of vineyards in Judea as en- 
closures of loose stones, with the square gray tower at the 
corner of each. Allusions to these watching-places, temporary 
and permanent, are frequent in Scripture. Thus, “a booth in 
a vineyard” (Isa. i. 8). “The earth moveth to and fro like a 


118 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca. XXT. 


hammock” (so Cheyne on Isa.; A. V., cottage ; Rev., hut), a 
vineyard-watchman’s deserted hammock tossed to and fro by 
the storm (Isa. xxiv. 20). So Job speaks of a booth which the 
keeper of a vineyard runneth up (xxvii. 18), a hut made of 
sticks and hung with mats, erected only for the harvest season 
on the field or vineyard, for the watchman who spreads his 
rude bed upon its high platform, and mounts guard against the 
robber and the beast. In Spain, where, especially in the South, 
the Orient has left its mark, not only upon architecture but 
also upon agricultural implements and methods, Archbishop 
Trench says that he has observed similar temporary structures 
erected for watchmen in the vineyards. The tower alluded to 
in this passage would seem to have been of a more permanent 
character (see Stanley above), and some have thought that it 
was intended not only for watching, but as a storehouse for the 
wine and a lodging for the workmen. 


Let it out (é&éSero). “There were three modes of dealing 
with land. According to one of these, the laborers employed 
received a certain portion of the fruits, say a third or a fourth 
of the produce. The other two modes were, either that the 
tenant paid a money-rent to the proprietor, or else that he 
agreed to give the owner a definite amount of the produce, 
whether the harvest had been good or bad. Such leases were 
given by the year or for life; sometimes the lease was even 
hereditary, passing from father to son. There can scarcely be 
a doubt that it is the latter kind of lease which is referred to in 
the parable: the lessees being bound to give the owner a certain 
amount of fruits in their season ” (Edersheim, “Life and 
Times of Jesus”). Compare ver. 34, and Mark xii. 2, “that he 
might receive of the fruits ” (dard tév KapTrav). 


37. They will reverence (€vtparjoovra). The verb liter- 
ally means to ¢wrn toward ; hence to give heed to, pay respect to. 


41. He will miserably destroy those wicked men (xaxovds 
KaK@s atrohécet avtovs). There is a play upon the words which 
the A. V. misses and the Rev. preserves by rendering “ méser. 


Gapxxat | MATTHEW. UA) 


ably destroy those miserable men.” So the Rheims version : 
“The naughty men will he bring to naught.” Tynd., “ He 
will evi? destroy those evzl persons.” The order of the Greek 
words is also striking : Miserable men, miserably he will destroy 
them. 


Which (ofrcves). The compound Greek pronoun marks the 
character of the new husbandmen more distinctly than the 
simple which ; husbandmen of such a character that, or belong- 
ing to that class of honest men who will give him his due. 


44, Shall be broken (cuvdIracdjoerar). The verb is 
stronger: broken to pieces ; so Rev. 


Grind him to powder (Aucuynoes avrov). But the A. V. 
misses the picture in the word, which is that of the wennowing- 
fan that separates the grain from the chaff. Literally it is, 
will winnow him. Rev., scatter him as dust. 


CHAPTER XXII. 


2. Made a marriage (ézrolnoev yduous). But the phrase 
refers to the marriage-feast, rather than to the marriage-cere- 
mony. In Esther ix. 22, the word is used of feasting without 
any reference to a marriage. Rev., a marrrage-feast. 


3. To call them that were bidden (xarécau tovs Kexdy- 
yévous). Perhaps an unconscious play on the words, lost in both 
A. V. and Rev., to call the called. This was according to the 
Oriental custom of sending a messenger, after the invitations 
have been issued, to notify the invited guests that the enter- 
tainment is prepared. Thus Esther invites Haman to a ban- 
quet on the morrow, and, at the actual time, the chamberlain 
comes to bring him to the feast (Esth. v. 8; vi. 14). 


4, Dinner (apucrov). Not the principal meal of the day, 
but a noon-breakfast ; luncheon. 


120 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. ([Cu. XXII. 


Fatlings (citicra). From ciros, corn, grain, or food gener- 
rally. Properly animals especially fed up or fatted for a feast. 


5. Made light of it (@uedjoavres). Not in the sense of 
jeering. ‘They simply gave it no heed. 


His farm (i8cov aypov). Rev., his own farm; bringing out 
the contrast between his selfish interest and the respect due to 
his king. Compare 2 Chron. xxx. 10. 


7. Armies (ctpatevpara). Not in our grand sense of ar- 
mies, but troops, soldiers. Compare Luke xxiii. 11, where the 
word is rendered men of war ; Rev., soldiers. 


9. Highways (dvefddous). Literally, the word means a way 
out through ; passage, outlet, thoroughfare. The idea of cross- 
igs grows out of the junction of the smaller cross-ways with 
the trunk roads. 


10. Was furnished (éA7jo3n). The Greek is stronger; 
was filled: so Rev. 


11. To see (JeacacJar). Rev., somewhat stiffly, behold . 
but the idea is correct, as the verb denotes careful seeing, look- 
ing intently, inspection. See on Matt. xi. 7, 


12. Not having (u7 éywv). It is hardly possible to convey 
the subtle sense of the negative particle (u%) to the English 
reader. A different word for not (ov«) is used in the preceding 
verse, expressing an outward, objective fact which attracted the 
king’s notice. The man had not (ovr) a wedding garment. 
When the king addresses the guest, he is thinking not so much 
of the outward token of disrespect, as of the guest’s mental 
attitude toward the proprieties of the occasion. It is as if he 
had said, “ What were you thinking of, where was your respect 
for me and for my guests, when you allowed yourself to come 
hither not (u7)) having the proper garment, as you knew you 
ought to have?” It implies, as Dr. Morison observes, that the 


Ga. XXIL.]J MATTHEW. 121 


man was conscious of the omission when he entered, and was 
intentionally guilty of the neglect. This distinction between 
the two negative particles rests on the law of the Greek lan- 
guage, according to which od and its compounds stand where 
something is to be denied as a matter of fact, and yu and its 
compounds when something is to be denied as a matter of 
thought. 


He was speechless (édiwodn). Lit., he was muzzled or 
gagged. It is used of muzzling the ox (1 Tim. v. 18), and is ad- 
dressed by Christ to the demon (Mark i. 25), and to the raging 
sea (Mark iv. 39). Peter uses it of putting the ignorant and 
foolish to silence (1 Pet. ii. 15). 


The outer darkness. See on Matt. viii. 12. 


15. Entangle (zayéevowow). From mays, a trap or snare. 
Better, therefore, Rev., ensnare. 


19. Tribute-money (vopsopa Tod Knvaoov). Lit., the current 
coin of tribute, which was paid not in Jewish but in Roman 
money. See on ch. xvii. 25, trebute. 


A penny. See on Matt. xx. 2. 


20. Image and superscription (e/cov cal éruypady). Im- 
ages on coins were not approved by the Jews. Out of respect 
to this prejudice none of the earlier Herods had his own image 
impressed on them. Herod Agrippa I., who murdered James 
and imprisoned Peter, introduced the practice. The coin shown 
to Christ must either have been struck in Rome, or else was 
one of the Tetrarch Philip, who was the first to introduce the 
image of Caesar on strictly Jewish coins. 


24. Shall marry (érvyapBpevce). From yauBpos, a word 
used in classical Greek to denote any one connected by marriage : 
a brother-in-law, father-in-law, even a bridegroom. The word 
is appropriate here because it refers to marriage between mar- 
riage-relatives.

34. Put to silence (épiuwcev). There is a kind of grim 
humor in the use of this word: he had muzzled the Sadducees. 


Compare ver. 12. 


36. Which is the great commandment (sola évTod) pe- 
yarn). The A. V.and Rev. alike miss the point of this question, 
which is: which kind of command is great in the law? Thatis, 
what kind of acommandment must it be to constitute it a great 
one? Not, which commandment is greatest as compared with 
the others? The scribes declared that there were 248 affirma- 
tive precepts, as many as the members of the human body ; 
and 365 negative precepts, as many as the days in the year; 
the total being 613, the number of letters in the Decalogue. Of 
these they called some ght and some heavy. Some thought 
that the law about the fringes on the garments was the greatest ; 
some that the omission of washings was as bad as homicide; 
some that the third commandment was the greatest. It was in 
view of this kind of distinction that the scribe asked the ques- 
tion; not as desiring a declaration as to which commandment 
was greatest, but as wanting to know the principle upon which 
a commandment was to be regarded as a great commandment. 


38. The great and first. With the definite article, 


89. A second. The article omitted. So Rev. 


CHAPTER XXIII. 


2. Moses’ seat (xadédpas). Or chair, as Wyc., in allusion to 
the practice of teachers sitting. 


5. To be seen (pos 76 Jeadjvar). See vi. 1, where the 
same word occurs. The scribes and Pharisees deport them- 
selves with a view to being contemplated as actors in a theatre : 
so that men may fix their gaze upon them admiringly. 


Phylacteries—Borders of their garments (gurAaKTHpva— 
xpaomeda). Phylacteries, called by the Rabbis tephillin, 


Tom eeOVLiAD VeerTEBE 
é*GEL tet @ 


Cu. XXIII.) MATTHEW. 123 


prayer-fillets, were worn on the left arm, toward the heart, and 
on the forehead. They were capsules containing on parchment 
these four passages of Scripture: Ex. xiii. 1-10; xiii. 11-16; 
Deut. vi. 4-9; xi. 18-21. That for the head was to consist of 
a box with four compartments, each containing a slip of parch- 
ment inscribed with one of the four passages. Each of these 
slips was to be tied up with well-washed hair from a calf’s 
tail; lest, if tied with wool or thread, any fungoid growth 
should ever pollute them. The phylactery of the arm was to 
contain a single slip, with the same four passages written in four 
columns of seven lineseach. The black leather straps by which 
they were fastened were wound seven times round the arm 
and three times round the hand. They were reverenced by the 
Rabbis as highly as the scriptures, and, like them, might be 
rescued from the flames on a Sabbath. They profanely imag- 
ined that God wore the tephillin. 

The Greek word transcribed phylactertes in our versions is 
from dvddcow, to watch or guard. It means originally a 
guarded post, a fort ; then, generally, a safeguard or preserva- 
tive, and therefore an amulet. Sir J. Cheke renders guards. 
They were treated as such by the Rabbis. It is said, for in- 
stance, that the courtiers of a certain king, intending to kill a 
Rabbi, were deterred by seeing that the straps of his phylac- 
teries shone like bands of fire. It was also said that they pre- 
vented all hostile demons from injuring any Israelite. See on 
Matt. ix. 20, for borders. 


6. The uppermost rooms (7pwtoxdciav). Rev., more cor- 
rectly, the chief place, the foremost couch or uppermost place on 


the divan. 


7. Rabbi. My master. In addressing Jesus, diddoKardos 
(teacher) answers to Rabbi. Compare John i. 39; Luke ii. 46. 


9. Father (zarépa). Aimed at those who courted the title 
Abba, or Father. Compare the title Papa—Pope. 


10. Masters (xaInynta/). Lit., leaders. 


124 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XXIII 


18. Hypocrites (i7oxpita/). From iroxpivw, to separate 
gradually ; so of separating the truth from a mass of falsehood, 
and thence to subject to inquiry, and, as a result of this, to ex 
pound or interpret what is elicited. Then, to reply to inquiry, 
and so to answer on the stage, to speak in dialogue, to act. From 
this the transition is easy to assuming, feigning, playing a 
part. The hypocrite is, therefore, etymologically, an actor. 


Against (éu7pocSev). Very graphic. The preposition means 
before, or in the face of. They shut the door in men’s faces. 


18. He is guilty (6pe/rAe). In the rendering of this word 
the A. V. seems to have been shaped by the earlier and now 
obsolete sense of gudlt, which was probably a fine or payment. 
Compare Anglo-Saxon gyld, a recompense, and German geld, 
money. There is a hint of this sense in Shakspeare, Henry 
IV. (Second Part), Act iv., Se. 4: 


‘‘England shall double gild his treble guilt,” 


where the play upon the words hovers between the sense of be- 
deck and recompense. Wyc. renders oweth, and Tynd., he és 
debtor. Reyv., he is a debtor. 


23. Ve Tithe (amrodexarodre). amo, from, Sexatow, to take a 
tenth. Tithe is tenth ; also in older English, tethe, as tethe hest, 
the tenth commandment. A tething was a district containing 
ten families. 


Mint (jdvocpov). 15vs, sweet, doy, smell. A favorite plant 
in the Kast, with which the floors of dwellings and synagogues 
were sometimes strewn. 


Anise—Cummin (dvnIov—xdpwvov). Rev. renders anise, 
dill in margin. Used as condiments. The tithe of these 
plants would be very small; but to exact it would indicate 
scrupulous conscientiousness. The Talmud tells of the ass of a 
certain Rabbi which had been so well trained as to refuse corn 
of which the tithes had not been taken. 


Cu. XXIIL)] MATTHEW. 125 


Faith (wiotw). Rather faithfulness, as in Rom. iii. 3, Rev. 
Gal. v. 22, Rev. 


24. Strain at (SwAifovtes). Sua, thoroughly or through, and 
trifw, to filter or strain. Strain at is an old misprint perpetu- 
ated. Hence the Rev. correctly, as Tynd., strain out. Insects 
were ceremonially unclean (Lev. xi. 20, 23, 41, 42), so that the 
Jews strained their wine in order not to swallow any unclean 
animal. Moreover, there were certain insects which bred in 
wine. Aristotle uses the word gnat (k@vwma) of a worm or 
larva found in the sediment of sour wine. “In a ride from 
Tangier to Tetuan I observed that a Moorish soldier who ac- 
companied me, when he drank, always unfolded the end of his 
turban and placed it over the mouth of his dota, drinking 
through the muslin to strain out the gnats, whose larvae swarm 
in the water of that country ” (cited by Trench, “On the Author- 
ized Version ”). 


Swallow (xatazivorvtes). The rendering is feeble. It is 
drink down (kard); gulp. Note that the camel was also un- 
clean (Lev. xi. 4). 


25. Platter (apoyidos). apd, beside, drpov, meat. A side- 
dish, with the accompanying sense of something dainty ; later, 
as here, the dish itself as distinguished from its contents. 


Excess (dxpacias). a, not, patos, power. Hence conduct 
which shows a want of power over one’s self: encontenence or 
intemperance. 


27. Whited sepulchres (rddous xexoviapévois). Not the 
rock-tombs, belonging mostly to the rich, but the graves cov- 
ered with plastered structures. In general, cemeteries were 
outside of cities; but any dead body found in the field was to 
be buried on the spot where it had been discovered. A pilgrim 
to the Passover, for instance, might easily come upon such a 
grave in his journey, and contract uncleanness by the contact 
(Num. xix. 16). It was therefore ordered that all sepulchres 


126 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XXIII 


should be whitewashed a month before Passover, in order to 
make them conspicuous, so that travellers might avoid ceremo- 
nial defilement. The fact that this general whitewashing was 
going on at the time when Jesus administered this rebuke to 
the Pharisees gave point to the comparison. The word xexo- 
viapevors (whitened, from Kxovis, dust) carries the idea of whiten- 
ing with a powder, as powdered lime. 


29. Tombs of the prophets. By this name are called four 
monuments at the base of the Mount of Olives, in the valley of 
Jehoshaphat ; called at present the tombs of Zechariah, Absa- 
Jom, Jehoshaphat, and St. James. Two of them are monoliths 
cut out of the solid rock; the others are merely excavations, with 
ornamental portals. ‘‘‘They appear,” says Dr. Thomson, “to be 
quite extensive, consisting of winding or semicircular galleries, 
passing under the mountain more than a hundred feet from 
east to west, and terminating in a rotunda about eighty feet 
from the entrance. There is no authority for the name which 
they commonly bear.” Possibly they were in sight of our 
Lord when he spoke, and were pointed to by him. The refer- 
ence would be all the more telling, if, as has been conjectured, 
the Pharisees were engaged in constructing the tombs of Zech- 
ariah and Absalom at the time that the Lord addressed them, and 
that the chambered sepulchres of James and J ehoshaphat, lying 
between those two, were the sepulchres which they were gar- 
nishing at their entrances. 


35. Temple (vaod). Rev., rightly, sanctuary. See on Matt. 
iv.5. Zechariah was slain between the temple proper and the 
altar of burnt-offering, in the priests’ court. 


37. Hen (dps). Generic: bird or Jowl; but hen is used 
generically of the mother-bird of all species. 


Cu. XXIV.) MATTHEW. 127 


CHAPTER XXIV. 


1. Went out and departed from the temple (é&ASav 
amo Tov iepod érropeveto). Rev., better: Went out from the tem- 
ple and was going on his way. The temple, iepod, not vaod : 
the whole of the buildings connected with the temple, all of 
which, including the vads, or sanctuary, and the porches and 
courts, constituted the tepdv. See on Matt. iv. 5. 


3. Coming (aapovaias). Originally, presence, from tapel- 
vat, to be present. In this sense in Philip. ii. 12; 2 Cor. x. 10. 
Also arrival, as in 1 Cor. xvi. 17; 2 Cor. vii. 6, 7; 2 Thess. ii. 
9; 2 Pet. iii. 12. Of the second coming of Christ: James v. 
8; 1 John ii. 28; 2 Pet. iii. 4; 1 Thess. iv. 15. 


Of the world (aiavos). Rather the existing, current age. 
They do not ask the signs of the Messiah’s coming at the end 
of all time, to judge the world. 


4. Deceive (7Aavjon).) Lit., lead astray, as Rev. 


5. In my name (él 7 dvouarti pov). Lit., on my name, 
2.é., on the strength of; resting their claims on the name Mes- 
siah. 


12. Shall abound (rAnIvvIjvar).  Lit., shall be multiplied. 
See Acts vi. 1, 7; vii. 17; ix. 31; Heb. vi. 14. 


Of many (Trav 7odAdv). The A. V. in omitting the defi- 
nite article, misses the force of Christ’ssaying. It is not the love 
of many people only that shall be chilled, but of the many, the 
majority, the great body. 


Wax cold (yuyjcerar). The verb means originally to breathe 
or blow ; and the picture is that of spiritual energy blighted or 
chilled by a malign or poisonous wind. 


128 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Ca. XXIV. 


14. World (74 oixoupévy). Lit., the inhabited. The whole 
habitable globe. Rev., in margin, inhabited earth. 


15. Abomination of desolation (@déAuypya THs épnuecews). 
The cognate verb, BdeAvocouas, means to feel a nausea or loath- 
ing for food : hence used of disgust generally. In a moral sense 
it denotes an object of moral or religious repugnance. See 2 
Chron. xv. 8; Jer. xiii. 27; Ezek. xi. 21; Dan. ix. 27; xi. 31. 
It is used as equivalent to zdol in 1 Kings xi. 17; Deut. vii. 
26; 2 Kings xxiii. 138. It denotes anything in which estrange- 
ment from God manifests itself; as the eating of unclean 
beasts, Lev. xi. 11; Deut. xiv. 3; and, generally, all forms of 
heathenism. This moral sense must be emphasized in the New 
Testament use of the word. Compare Luke xvi. 15; Apoc. xvii. 
4,55 xxi. 27. It does not denote mere physical or esthetic dis- 
gust. The reference here is probably to the occupation of the 
temple precincts by the idolatrous Romans under Titus, with 
their standards and ensigns. Josephus says that, after the 
burning of the temple the Romans brought their ensigns and 
set them over against the eastern gate, and there they offered 
sacrifices to them, and declared Titus, with acclamations, to be 
emperor. 


17. Him which is on the house.top (6 émi tod Sépuaros). 
From roof to roof there might be a regular communication, 
called by the Rabbis “the road of the roofs.” Thus a person 
could make his escape passing from roof to roof, till, at the last 
house, he would descend the stairs on the outside of the house, 
but within the exterior court. The urgency of the flight is en- 
hanced by the fact that the stairs lead into this court. “ Though 
you must pass by the very door of your room, do not enter to 
take anything out. Escape for your life.” 


22. Should be shortened (€xoA0Badnoav). Rev., had been 
shortened. A very picturesque word. The verb is, literally, 
to dock, to cut off, leaving a stump, as a limb. Wyc., abridged. 
As a fact, various causes did combine to shorten the siege, 
Herod Agrippa was stopped in his work of strengthening 


Cu. XXIV.] MATTHEW. 129 


the walls by orders from the emperor; the Jews, absorbed in 
their party strifes, had totally neglected preparations to stand a 
siege ; the magazines of corn and provisions were burnt before 
the arrival of Titus. Titus arrived suddenly, and the Jews 
voluntarily abandoned parts of the fortification. Titus himself 
confessed that God was against the Jews, since otherwise 
neither his armies nor his engines would have availed against 
their defences. 


24. Signs and wonders (onpeia cal tépata). See on Matt. 
xi. 20. The two words often joined in the New Testament. 
See John iv. 48; Acts ii. 22; iv. 30; 2 Cor. xii. 12. The 
words do not denote different classes of supernatural manifesta- 
tions, but these manifestations regarded from different points 
of view. The same miracle may be a mzghty work, or a 
glorious work, regarded with reference to its power and gran- 
deur ; or a stgn of the doer’s supernatural power; or a wonder, 
as it appeals to the spectator. Tépas (derivation uncertain) is 
a miracle regarded as a portent or prodigy, awakening amaze- 
ment. It most nearly corresponds, therefore, to the etymo- 
logical sense of the word miracle (Lat., miraculum, a wonderful 
thing, from mirari, to wonder). 


96. In the desert—Secret chambers. Rev., wilderness— 
inner chambers. Both retired places, indicating that the false 
Messiahs will avoid public scrutiny. 


27. Shineth (daiverar). Rev., better, is seen. The coming 
of the Lord will be a plain, unmistakable fact, like the light- 
ning which lightens both ends of the heaven at once, and is 
seen of all. It will not be connected with some particular 
place, but will manifest itself and be recognized over the whole 
world. Compare Apoc. i, 7: “Every eye shall see him.” 


98. Carcase (rrapya). From mira, to fall. Originally a 
fall, and thence a fallen body ; a corpse. Compare Lat. cadaver, 
from cado, to fall. See Mark vi. 29; Apoc. xi. 8. On the 
saying pele compare Job xxxix. 30. 


130 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XXIV. 


Eagles (deror). Rev. puts vultures in margin. The griffon 
vulture is meant, which surpasses the eagle in size and power. 
Aristotle notes how this bird scents its prey from afar, and 
congregates in the wake of an army. In the Russian war vast 
numbers were collected in the Crimea, and remained until the 
end of the campaign in the neighborhood of the camp, although 
previously scarcely known in the country. 


30. Mourn («dovra:). Stronger: beat their breasts in an- 
guish. 


31. With a great sound of a trumpet (werd oddruyyos 
povis weyadys). Some read with a great trumpet. The blow- 
ing of trumpets was anciently the signal for the host of Israel 
on their march through the desert. It summoned to war, and 
proclaimed public festivals, and marked the beginnings of 
months; Num. x. 1-10; Ps. Ixxxi. 3. Hence the symbolism 
of the New Testament. Jehovah’s people shall be summoned 
before their king by sound of trumpet. Compare the procla- 
mation of Christ as king at the trumpet of the seventh angel, 
Apoc. xi. 15. 


32. A parable (7v wapaBoajv). More strictly, the parable 
which she has to teach. Rightly, therefore, Rev., her parable. 


Branch («ddéos). From «rAde, to break. Hence a young 
slip or shoot, such as is broken off for grafting. Such were 
the “ branches ” which were cut down and strewed in the Lord’s 
path by the multitudes (Matt. xxi. 8). 


40. Shall be taken—left. Both verbs are in the present 


tense, which makes the saying more lively. One ds taken and 
one vs left. So Rev. 


41. The mill (76 ytd). The ordinary hand-mill with a 
handle fixed near the edge of the upper stone, which is turned 
by two women. 


Cu. XXV.] MATTHEW. 131 


42. What hour. Later texts, however, read juépa, day. 
mola nuepa, in what kind of a day, whether a near or a remote 
one. Similarly ver. 43: év qoia duvdaxg, in what kind of a 
watch, whether a night or a morning watch. 


43. Would come (épyerat). Rev., was coming. But the 
present is graphically thrown in as in vv, 40, 41: 2s coming or 
cometh. 


Broken up (Svopuyfvas). Rev., broken through. See on 
Matt. vi. 19. Wye., undermined. 


45. In due season (év capo). At the regular hours which 
his Lord observes when at home; and not delaying because he 
thinks that his Lord delayeth his coming (ver. 48), but doing his 
duty in its appointed time. 


CHAPTER XXV. 


1. Lamps (Aaumd&as). Lit., torches. Probably a short, 
wooden stem held in the hand, with a dish at the top, in which 
was a piece of cloth dipped in oil or pitch. 


3. They that were foolish (afrwes pwpal). Read ai yap 
popal, for the foolish. The for justifies the epithet foolish in 
the preceding verse. 


5. Slumbered and slept (€vdoratav kai éxddevdov). Slum- 
bered is, literally, nodded. Note the variation of tense. Modded 
is aorist, denoting a transient act, the ineteal stage of slumber. 
They dropped their heads. Slept is imperfect, of continuous 
slumber. 


6. There was acry made (xpavy7 yéyovev). Rev., there is 
acry. The verb is in the perfect tense, representing the past 
event as perpetuated in the present result, and hence is rendered 
by the English present. A great and decisive change was the 


132 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. ([Cu. XXV. 


result of the cry. No more sleeping, waiting, or silence. There 
is a cry, and behold the awaking, the bustle, the trimming of 
lamps and the running to the oil-vendors. 


To meet him (eis dardvrnow). The translation can hardly’ 
convey the meaning of the Greek phrase, which implies @ cus- 
tom or familiar ceremony. Come forth wnto meeting. 


7. Then all those virgins arose (rote nyépInoav Tacar au 
mapdJévor éxeivat). The Greek order is expressive. Zhen arose 
all the virgins, those former ones. Those (éxeivar) a pronoun of 
remoter reference, and emphatic by its position at the end of 
the sentence. 


Trimmed (éxdcpncav). From xocpds, order, and meaning 
to put in order or arrange. Tynd., prepared. Trench (“ Para- 
bles ”) quotes from Ward (‘“ View of the Hindoos”), describing 
a marriage ceremony in India: “ After waiting two or three 
hours, at length near midnight it was announced, as in the very 
words of Scripture, ‘ Behold the bridegroom cometh ; go ye out 
to meet him.’ All the persons employed now lighted their 
lamps, and ran with them in their hands to fill up their stations 
in the procession. Some of them had lost their lights, and 
were unprepared, but it was then too late to seek them, and the 
cavalcade moved forward.” 


Their lamps (cav7ov). Lit., “ their own lamps ;” emphasiz- 
ing the personal preparation in contrast with the foolish, who 
depended for supply on their fellows. 


8. Are gone out (cBéwuvra). The A. V. misses the 
graphic force of the continuous present, denoting something in 
progress. They see the flame waning and flickering, and ery, 
Our lamps are gong out! So Rev. 


9. Not so, lest, ete. (uote od 7 dpKéon). The Greek does 
not give the blunt negative of the A. V. It is a more courteous 
form of refusal, making the reason for refusing to supply the 


Cu. XXV.] MATTHEW. 133 


place of the negative. Give us of your oil, say the foolish. 
The wise reply, Lest perchance there be not by any means 
(od 7, the double negative) enough. The Rev. gives it very 
happily. Peradventure there will not be enough, ete. 


10. And while they went (a7epyouévev). A present parti- 
ciple, and very graphic: whzle they are going away. 


They that were ready (ai éroor). Lit., the ready or pre- 
pared ones. 


To the marriage (ydyous). Marriage-feast, as Matt. xxii. 
2, 8,4; and so Rev. 


11. Lord, lord. Applying directly to the bridegroom, 
whose will was supreme, now that he had arrived at the bride’s 
residence. 


14. Travelling (aoénudv). The sense is more nearly about 
to travel, like our going abroad. 


15. Several ability (d/av). Lit., his own or peculear capac- 
ity for business. 


16. Straightway (evJéws). Connected with the beginning 
of this verse, instead of with the end of ver. 15: Straightway 
he that had recewed, etc., indicating promptness on the servant’s 
part. 


Traded with them (pydcato év avrois). Lit., wrought 
with them. The virgins watt, the servants work. 


Made (éroincev). Not made them, as A. V. The word is 
used in our sense of make money. Wye. and Tynd., won. 
Geneva, gained. Some read éxépdnoev, gained, as in ver. 17. 


94. Hard (cxdnpos). Stronger than the austere (avotnpos) 
of Luke xix. 21 (see there), which is sometimes used in a good

sense, as this never is. It is an epithet given to a surface 
which is at once dry and hard. 


Strawed (Suecxdpricas). Rev., didst scatter. Not referring 
to the sowing of seed, for that would be saying the same thing 
twice. The scattering refers to the winnowing of the loosened 
sheaves spread out upon the threshing-floor. “The word,” as 
Trench observes “could scarcely be applied to the measured 
and orderly scattering of the sower’s seed. It is rather the dis- 
persing, making to fly in every direction.” Hence used of the 
pursuit of a routed enemy (Luke i. 51); of the prodigal scatter- 
ing his goods; making the money fly, as we say (Luke xv. 13); 
of the wolf scattering the sheep (Matt. xxvi. 31). Wyc., spread 
abroad. 


25. That is thine (76 dv). The Greek is more concise, and 
is better given by Rev., Lo, thou hast thine own. 


26. Slothful. With no more trouble than he expended in 
digging, he might have gone to the exchangers. The verse 
should be read interrogatively, Didst thou indeed know this of 
me? ‘Thou shouldst then have acted with the promptness and 
care which one observes in dealing with a hard master. To 
omit the interrogation is to make the Lord admit that he was 
a hard master. 


27. Put (Baretv). Lit., throw or fling down, as one would 
throw a bag of coin upon the exchanger’s table. 


Exchangers (rpamefi/rais). Taking their name from the 
table or counter at which they sat (tpdamefa). The Jewish bank- 
ers bore precisely the same name. 


Usury (rox@). A very graphic word, meaning first chéld- 
berth, and then offspring. Hence of interest, which is the prod- 
uce or offspring of capital. Originally it was only what was 
paid for the wse of money ; hence wswry,; but it became synony- 
mous with extortionate interest. Rev., better, with interest. 


Cu. XXV.]J MATTHEW. 135 


The Jewish law distinguished between interest and «crease. 
In Rome very high interest seems to have been charged in early 
times. Practically usury was unlimited. It soon became the 
custom to charge monthly interest at one per cent. a month. 
During the early empire legal interest stood at eight per cent., 
but in usurious transactions it was lent at twelve, twenty-four, 
and even forty-eight. The Jewish bankers of Palestine and 
elsewhere were engaged in the same undertakings. The law of 
Moses denounced usury in the transactions of Hebrews with 
Hebrews, but permitted it in dealing with strangers (Deut. 
xxii. 19; 20*9Ps. xv: 5). 


32. All the nations (davta ta é3vn). The whole human 
race; though the word is generally employed in the New Tes- 
tament to denote Gentiles as distinguished from Jews. 


Separate them (adrovs). Masculine, while the word nations 
isneuter. Nations are regarded as gathered collectwely ; but in 
contemplating the act of separation the Lord regards the mdv- 
viduals. 


The sheep from the goats (or kids, so Rev. in margin). 
“The bald division of men into sheep and goats is, in one sense, 
so easy as not to be worth performing ; and in another sense it is 
so hard as only to be possible for something with supernatural 
insight ” (John Morley, ‘“ Voltaire”). Goats are an appro- 
priate figure, because the goat was regarded as a comparatively 
worthless animal. Hence the point of the elder son’s complaint 
in the parable of the Prodigal: Mot so much as a kid (Luke xv. 
29). The diminutive (épi¢ia) expresses contempt. 


33. Goats (épi¢va). Diminutive. Lit., kedlings. Thesheep 
and goats are represented as having previously pastured together. 
Compare the parables of the Tares and the Net. 


On the right (é« defav). Lit., from the right side or parts. 
The picture to the Greek reader is that of a row, beginning at 
the judge’s right hand.

less and ye lodged me. The preposition ovv implies along with. 
Ye took me wth you into the household circle.

word visit is from the Latin wiso, to look steadfastly at, and 
thence to visit. We retain the original thought in the popular 
phrases go to sce one, and to look im upon one. 


40. The least. The word in the Greek order is emphatic: 
One of these my brethren, ¢he least. So Rev., even these least. 


CHAPTER XXVI. 


2. 1s betrayed (sapaédisorar). The present tense expresses 
here something which, though future, is as good as present, be- 
cause already determined, or because it must ensue in virtue of 
an unalterable law. Thus the passover zs (yiveras): it must 
come round at the fixed season. The Son of Man ¢s betrayed 
according to the divine decree. Compare ver. 24. 


3. Palace (addi). But the word never means padace in the 
New Testament. It is the court, the open court or hall, form- 
ing the centre of an oriental building, and often used as a meet- 
ing-place. Rev., court. Wyce., hall. 


7. An alabaster box (4AdBacrpov). Rev., cruse » flask in 
margin. Lit., an alabaster, just as we call a drinking-vessel 
made of glass a glass. Luther renders glass. It was a kind of 
cruet, having a cylindrical form at the top. Pliny compares 
these vessels to a closed rosebud, and says that ointments are 
best preserved in them. 


8. To what purpose is this waste ? Wyc., Whereto this 
loss? Tynd., What needed this waste? See on John xii. 3. 


10. When Jesus understood it (yvods 88 6 ‘Inoods). The 
A. V. implies that some time elapsed before Jesus was aware

of the disciples’ complaint. But the statement is that Jesus 
perceived it at once. Rev., rightly, Jesus perceiving tt. 


Good work (xadov). Lit., beautiful, but in a moral sense: 
an excellent, morally beautiful deed.

What are ye willing to giwe me? It brings out the chaffering 
aspect of the transaction. So Rev. 


They covenanted with him for (e€crncav aire). But the 
meaning is, they weighed unto him; or, very literally, they 
placed for him (in the balance). Although coined shekels were 
in circulation, weighing appears to have been practised, espe- 
cially when considerable sums were paid out of the temple- 
treasury. 


Thirty pieces of silver (rpidxovta apyipia). Matthew re, 
fers to Zech. xi.12. These pieces were shekels of the sanctuary, 
of standard weight, and therefore heavier than the ordinary 
shekel. See on Matt. xvii. 24. Reckoning the Jerusalem 
shekel at seventy-two cents, the sum would be twenty-one dol- 
lars and sixty cents. This was the price which, by the Mosaic 
law, a man was condemned to pay if his ox should gore a ser- 
vant (Exod. xxi. 32). Our Lord, the sacrifice for men, was 
paid for out of the temple-money, destined for the purchase 
of sacrifices. He who “took on him the form of a servant” 
was sold at the legal price of a slave. 


18. Such a man (tov Seiva). The indefiniteness is the 
Evangelist’s, not our Lord’s. He, doubtless, described the per- 
son and where to find him. 


20. He sat down (dvéxerro). But this rendering misses the 
force of the imperfect tense, which denotes something in 
progress. The Evangelist says he was sitting or reclining, 
introducing us to something which has been going on for some 
time. 


188 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. ([Cu. XXVI. 


92. Began to say (#pEavTo). Denoting the commencement 
of a series of questions; one after the other (every one) saying, 
Is tt L? 


Is it 1 (usr eyo eis). The form of the negative expects a 
negative answer. “ Surely I am not the one.” 


93. The dish (tpuBdiw). Wye., platter. A dish containing 
a broth made with nuts, raisins, dates, figs, etc., into which 
pieces of bread were dipped. 


25. Which betrayed (6 wapadvdods). The article with the 
participle has the force of an epithet: Zhe betrayer. 


28. Testament (Sca97nns). From dvattInut, to distribute ; 
dispose of. Hence of the disposition of one’s property. On 
the idea of disposing or arranging is based that of settlement or 
agreement, and thence of a covenant. The Hebrew word of 
which this is a translation is primarily covenant, from a verb 
meaning to cut. Hence the phrase, to make @ covenant, in 
connection with dividing the victims slain in ratification of 
covenants (Gen. xv. 9-18). Covenant is the general Old Tes- 
tament sense of the word (1 Kings xx. 34; Isa. xxviii. 15; 
1 Sam. xviii. 3); and so in the New Testament. Compare 
Mark xiv. 24; Lukei. 72; xxii. 20; Acts ili. 25; vii. 8. Bishop 
Lightfoot, on Gal. iii. 15, observes that the word is never found 
in the New Testament in any other sense than that of covenant, 
with the exception of Heb. ix. 15-17, where it is testament. 
We cannot admit this exception, since we regard that passage 
as one of the best illustrations of the sense of covenant. See 
on Heb. ix. 15-17. Render here as Rev., covenant. 


Is shed (é€xyuvvduevov). The present participle, 2s being shed. 
Christ’s thought goes forward to the consummation. 


29. New («xawov). Another adjective, vedv, is employed to 
denote mew wine in the sense of freshly-made (Matt. ix. 17; 
Mark ii. 22; Luke v. 87, 38,39). The difference is between 


Ca. XXVL] MATTHEW. 139 


newness regarded in point of te or of guality. The young, for 
instance, who have dately sprung up, are véou or vedrepos (Luke 
xv. 12, 13). The new garment (Luke v. 36) is contrasted as to 
quality with a worn and threadbare one. Hence xawod. So a 
new heaven (2 Pet. iii. 13) is xawos, contrasted with that which 
shows signs of dissolution. The tomb in which the body of 
Jesus was laid was xawdv (Matt. xxvii. 60); in which no other 
body had lain, making it ceremonially unclean; not recently 
hewn. Trench (“Synonyms”) cites a passage from Polybius, 
relating a stratagem by which a town was nearly taken, and 
saying “we are still new («asvol) and young (véou) in regard of 
such deceits.” Here xawoi expresses the inexperience of the 
men ; véor, their youth. Still, the distinction cannot be pressed 
in all cases. Thus, 1 Cor. v. 7, “Purge out the old leaven 
that ye may be a new (véov) lump ;” and Col. iii. 10, “ Put on 
the new (véov) man,” plainly carry the sense of guality. In our 
Lord’s expression, “drink it new,” the idea of quality is domi- 
nant. All the elements of festivity in the heavenly kingdom 
will be of a new and higher quality. In the New Testament, 
besides the two cases just cited, véos is applied to wine, to the 
young, and once to @ covenant. 


30. Sung ahymn. Very probably the second part of the 
Jewish Hallel or Hallelujah, embracing Ps. cxv., exvi., cxvii., 
xviii. 


They went out. In the original institution of the Pass- 
over it was enjoined that no one should go out of his house 
until morning (Exod. xii. 22). Evidently this had ceased to be 
regarded as obligatory. 


32. | will go before you. The thought links itself with 
what Christ had just said about the shepherd and the sheep. 
Compare John x.4. I will go before you, as a shepherd before 
his flock. 


34. Before the cock crow. A little more graphic if the 
article is omitted, as in the Greek. Before a single cock shall 


140 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XXVI. 


be heard, early in the night, thou shalt deny me. Dr. Thom- 
son (“Land and Book”) says that the barn-door fowls “swarm 
round every door, share in the food of their possessors, are at 
home among the children in every room, roost overhead at 
night, and with their ceaseless crowing are the town-clock and 
the morning-bell to call up sleepers at early dawn.” 


35. Though | should die («dv Séy pe arodaveiv). The A. 
V. misses the force of 5é): “Though it should be necessary for 
me to die.” Wye., “If 2 shall behove me to die.” Rev., ex- 
cellently, “ Even if I must die.” 


36. Gethsemane. Meaning ov-press. Beyond the brook Ke- 
dron, and distant about three-quarters of a mile from the walls 
of Jerusalem. Dean Stanley says of the olive-trees there: “ In 
spite of all the doubts that can be raised against their antiquity, 
the eight aged olive-trees, if only by their manifest difference 
from all others on the mountain, have always struck the most 
indifferent observers. They will remain, so long as their already 
protracted life is spared, the most venerable of their race on the 
surface of the earth. Their gnarled trunks and scanty foliage 
will always be regarded as the most affecting of the sacred 
memorials in or about Jerusalem ; the most nearly approach- 
ing to the everlasting hills themselves in the force with which 
they carry us back to the events of the gospel history ” (“Sinai 
and Palestine”). 


40. What! It is hardly possible to convey the exact force of 
the Greek ottws, thus or so. The idea is, “are ye thus unable, 
or so utterly unable to watch ?” 


45. The hour is at hand. He probably heard the tramp 
and saw the lanterns of Judas and his band. 


47. One of the twelve. Repeated in all three evangelists, 
in the narratives both of the betrayal and of the arrest. By the 
time Matthew’s Gospel was written, the phrase had become a 
stereotyped designation of the traitor, like he that betrayed him. 


Cu. XXVL] MATTHEW. 141 


A great multitude. The Sanhedrin had neither soldiery 
nor a regularly-armed band at command. In John xviii. 3, 
Judas receives a cohort of soldiers and officers from the chief 
priests and Pharisees. Part of the band would consist of this 
regularly-armed cohort, and the rest of a crowd armed with 
cudgels, and embracing some of the servants of conspicuous 
men in the Sanhedrin. 


49. Kissed him (xcatedirncev). The compound verb has the 
force of an emphatic, ostentatious salute. Meyer says embraced 
and kissed. The same word is used of the tender caressing of 
the Lord’s feet by the woman in the Pharisee’s house (Luke vii. 
38), of the father’s embrace of the returned prodigal (Luke xv. 
920), and of the farewell of the Ephesian elders to Paul (Acts 
Ex, Ot} 


50. Wherefore art thou come ? (é¢’ 6 dpe). The inter- 
rogation of the A. V. is wrong. The expression is elliptical 
and condensed. Literally it is, that for which thou art here ; 
and the mind is to supply do or be about. The Lord spurns 
the traitor’s embrace, and says, in effect, ‘“‘ Enough of this hyp- 
ocritical fawning. Do what you are here to do.” So Rev., 
Do that for which thou art come. 


51. The servant (rév SodA0v). The article marks the spe- 
cial servant ; the body-servant. 


Ear (@riov). A diminutive in form but not in sense ; accord- 
ing to a Greek popular usage which expressed parts of the 
body by diminutives; as pima, the nostrals ; opparconv, the eye ; 
capkiov, the body. Peter aimed his blow at the servant’s head, 
but missed. 


52. Put up again. Peter was still brandishing his sword. 


53. Twelve legions of angels. Compare the story of 
Elisha at Dothan (2 Kings vi. 17). 


142 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca. XXVL 


55. A thief (Ayor}v). Better Rev., a robber. See John x. 
1, 8; and Luke xxiii. 39-43. It is more than a petty stealer; 
rather one with associates, who would require an armed band to 
apprehend him. Hence the propriety of the reference to swords 
and staves. 


I sat (€xaSefounv). The imperfect tense, denoting something 
habitual. I was accustomed to sit. 


63. | adjure thee. I call upon thee to swear. The high- 
priest put Christ upon oath. 


That (iva). Inorder that ; signifying the design with which 
he adjured the Lord. 


64. Thou hast said. An affirmation. You have spoken 
the truth. What thou hast asked me is the fact. Compare 
ver. 25. 


Nevertheless (7A). However. Apart from my affirma- 
tion, you shall see for yourself. 


66. Guilty of death (&oyos Savarov). Rev., worthy of 
death. See on Matt. xxiii.18. év, im, éyo, to hold. The idea 
is, literally, holden of death ; in bonds to death. 


67. Buffet (exordgicav). With the fist. 
Smote with the paims of their hands. All expressed by 
one word, épdmucav, from paris, a rod, and meaning to smite 


with rods, not with the palms. The same word is employed 
Matt. v. 39. It came to mean generally to strike. 


69. A damsel (ya raidicnn). Lit., one damsel, because 
the writer has in mind a second one (ver. 71). 


71. Gone out. Through fear of being further questioned. 


Cu. XXVIL] MATTHEW. 143 


72. The man. As if he did not know J esus’ name. 


74. To curse (xataJewarifew). Anew development of pro- 
fanity. Hitherto he had merely sworn. Now he adds umpre- 
cation; invoking curses on himself if the case be not as he says. 


CHAPTER XXVII. 
3. Repented himself (werayerndets). See on Matt. xxi. 29. 


What is that to us? They ignore the question of Christ’s 
innocence. As to Judas’ sin or conscience, that is Ads matter. 
Thou wilt see to that. 


5. Inthe temple. But the best reading is eds rov vaov, into 
the sanctuary. He cast the pieces over the barrier of the en- 
closure which surrounded the sanctuary, or temple proper, and 
within which only the priests were allowed, and therefore into 
the sanctuary. 


6. It is not lawful. In such cases the Jewish law provided 
that the money was to be restored to the donor; and if he in- 
sisted on giving it, that he should be induced to spend it for 
something for the public weal. This explains the apparent dis- 
crepancy between Matthew’s account and that in the book of 
Acts (i. 18). By a fiction of the law the money was still con- 
sidered to be Judas’, and to have been applied by him to the 
purchase of the potter’s field. 


Scarlet (xoxxinv). From xédxxos, cochineal, which grew in 
several parts of Greece. Garments of this color would seem to 
have been rare among the orientals. Herodotus relates that 
the admiration of Darius, then an officer in the army, was ex- 
cited by the scarlet cloak of a Samian exile, who, on his offering 
to purchase it, presented it to him, and was afterward richly 
rewarded when Darius came to the throne (iii. 189),

and emperors as well as soldiers wore. 


32. Compelled to go (jyydpevoav). See on Matt. v. 41. 
Rev. has <mpressed in margin. 


38. Golgotha. An Aramaic word, Gulgoltha, = the Hebrew, 
Gulgoleth, and translated skull in Judg. ix. 53; 2 Kings ix. 35. 
The word Calvary comes through the Latin calvaria, meaning 
skull, and used in the Vulgate. The New Testament narrative 
does not mention a mount or hill. The place was probably a 
rounded elevation. The meaning is not, as Tynd., a place of 
dead men’s skulls, but simply skull. 


34. Wine (olvov). The older texts read dfs, vinegar. The 
compound of wine and gall was intended as a stupefying 
draught. 


36. Watched (ér/jpouv). Or, to give the force of the imper- 
fect tense, kept watch. This was to prevent the infliction of 
wanton cruelties, and also to prevent what sometimes happened, 
the taking down and restoring of the victim. 


37. Accusation (airiav). Lit., cawse, and so rendered by 
Wyc. Tynd., cause of his death. The word accusation is com- 
pounded with the Latin causa, a cause. It is the cause of his 
condemnation and suffering. 


38. Thieves (Ayora/), Rev., robbers. See on Matt. xxvi. 
55. 


42. He saved others, etc. The Greek order is, Others he 
saved ; himself he cannot save. 


43. If he will have him (e¢ 9éreu avrov). Rev., correctly, 
Tf he desireth him: i.e., If he likes him. Compare Ps. xviii. 
(Sept. xvii.) 19; because he delighted in me (ndérAncE pe), Ps. 
xli. (Sept. xl.) 11 (redérnnas pe). 


Cu. XXVIL.] MATTHEW. 145 


36. Ninth hour. “Early on Friday afternoon the new 
course of priests, of Levites, and of the ‘ stationary men’ who 
were to be the representatives of all Israel, arrived in Jerusa- 
lem, and having prepared themselves for the festive season 
went up to the temple. The approach of the Sabbath, and then 
its actual commencement, were announced by threefold blasts 
from the priests’ trumpets. The first three blasts were blown 
when one-third of the evening-sacrifice service was over, or 
about the ninth hour; that is, about 3 p.m. on Friday ” (Eders- 
heim, “The Temple ”). 


48. Vinegar (fous). Sour wine; the posca or ordinary drink 
of the Roman soldiers. 


Gave him to drink (ésré7-fev). The imperfect tense implies 
was in the act of giving, or about to give. At this point the Jews 
standing near interposed, saying, Let be (ages)! “Stop! Do not 
give him the drink. Let us see if Elijah will come to his at 


50. Vielded up the ghost (adjxe 7d mvedua). Lit., des- 
missed his spirit. Rev., yielded up his spirit. The fact that 
the evangelists, in describing our Lord’s death, do not use the 
neuter verb, é9avev, he died, but he breathed out his life (e&- 
émvevoe, Mark xv. 37), he gave up his spirit (rapéSwxe 10 mveb- 
ya, John xix. 30), seems to imply a voluntary yielding up of his 
life. Compare John x. 18. Augustine says, “ He gave up his 
life because he willed it, when he willed it, and as he willed it.” 


51. The veil of the temple. According to the Rabbis this 
was a handbreadth in thickness, and woven of seventy-two 
twisted plaits, each plait consisting of twenty-four threads. It 
was sixty feet long and thirty wide. Two of them were made 
every year, and according to the exaggerated language of the 
time it needed three hundred priests to manipulate it. This 
veil was the one which covered the entrance to the holy of 
holies, and not, as has been asserted, the veil which hung before 
the main entrance to the sanctuary. The holy of holies con- 
tained only a large stone, on which the high-priest sprinkled

the blood on the day of atonement, occupying the place where 
the ark with the mercy-seat had stood. 


54. The Son of God. But there is no article. The words 
must not be construed as a recognition of Christ’s divine son- 
ship. They were uttered by a pagan soldier in his own sense 
of a demigod or hero. Yet they may have taken color from 
the fact that the soldiers had heard from the chief priests and 
others that Christ had claimed to be God’s son, 


55. Which had followed (aitwes). Denoting a class: who 
were of the body of women that had followed him. 


56. Magdalene (7) Mayéannv7)). Neither Mary of Bethany 
(Matt. xxvi. 6-13) nor the woman who had been a sinner (Luke 
vii. 87-48). The word denotes merely her town ; She of Mag- 
dala. 


57. When even was come. The Hebrews reckoned two 
evenings, an earlier and a later. The former began midway 
between noon and sunset, or at three o’clock in the afternoon. 
The latter began at sunset, six o’clock. The reference here is 
to the earlier evening, though the time may have been well on 
toward the beginning of the later. The preparations had to be 
hurried because the Sabbath would begin at sunset, 


60. New tomb (xaw@). See on Matt. xxvi. 29. Not newly 
hewn, but fresh, undefiled by anybody. 


A great stone. Though in the Jews’ sepulchres in general 
there were doors hung on hinges, the grooves and perforations 
for which may still be seen. Joseph’s tomb may have been 
differently constructed, or else was in an unfinished state. 


63. We remember (éuvjodnuev). Lit., we remembered : 1.€sy 
it occurred to us: we have just remembered, and have come to 
tell you before it shall be too late. 


Cu. XXVIIL] MATTHEW. 147 


That deceiver (éxetvos 6 Advos). The pronoun ¢hat is very 
picturesque ; being used of distant objects, and therefore here 
as pointing to one who is out of the way and far removed. 
TT\avos, deceiver, is akin to rAavde, to wander; and hence a 
vagabond impostor. 


64. Error (7Advm). Not, as many render, deceit or imposture, 
referring to 7Advos above; but the error on the people's part. 
The last error, namely, the false impression that he has risen 
from the dead, will be worse than the first error—the impression 
made by his impostures that he was the Messiah. 


65. Ye have (éyere). Or, as some render, imperatively : 
Have aguard! Rev., in margin, take. 


66. Sealing the stone and setting a watch (cdpayicavres 
Tov Mov, META THS KoveTwoias). Lit., having sealed the stone 
with the watch. Rev., Sealing the stone, the guard being with 
them. This is rather awkward, but the rendering rightly cor- 
rects the A. V. The idea is that they sealed the stone in the 
presence of the guard, and then left them to keep watch. It 
would be important that the guard should witness the sealing. 
The sealing was performed by stretching a cord across the stone 
and fastening it to the rock at either end by means of sealing 
clay. Or, if the stone at the door happened to be fastened with 
a cross beam, this latter was sealed to the rock. 


CHAPTER XXVITI. 


3. Countenance (eidéa). Rev., more correctly, appearance. 
The word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It does 
not refer to the face alone, but to the general aspect. Wye.,

alone notes the outward glory, the earthquake, the agency of

Secure you (ipas dpepipvovs roujcouer). Lit., make you 
without care. The word secure, however, is, etymologically, a 
correct rendering. It is from the Latin se = sie, without, and 
cura, care. It has passed into the popular meaning to make 
safe. Compare 1 Cor. vii. 32. “I would have you to be free 
From cares” (Rev.). 


17. Worshipped (spocexivncay). As in ver. 9. Prostrated 
themselves. The first time that the disciples are described as 
doing so. 


18. Came to. Verse 17 evidently describes the impression 
made by seeing him at a distance. Possibly from feelings of 
modesty they had not ventured close to him. Jesus now ap- 
proaches and addresses them. 


Spake—saying (€Addnoev—déyov). Two different words 
are here used to express speech, with a nice distinction which 
can hardly be conveyed without paraphrase. The verb Aadeiv 
is used of speaking, in contrast with or as a breaking of silence, 
voluntary or imposed. Thus the dumb man, after he was 


Cu. XXVIII.] MATTHEW. 149 


healed, spake (€Addnoev); and Zacharias, when his tongue was 
loosed, began to speak (édddev). In the use of the word the 
writer contemplates the fact rather than the substance of speech. 
Hence it is used of God (Heb. i. 1), the point being, not what 
God said, but the fact that he spake to men. On the contra- 
ry, Aéyew refers to the matter of speech. The verb originally 
means to pick out, and hence to use words selected as appropriate 
expressions of thought, and to put such words together in or- * 
derly discourse. Here, then, we have Jesus first breaking sv- 
lence (edddnoev), and then discoursing (Aéyor). 


Power (é£oucia). Better, authority, as Rev. 
Is given (€5697). Lit., was given, by the divine decree. 
19. Teach (wadnrevcate). Rev., rightly, make disciples of. 


In the name (eis ro dvoua). Rev., correctly, “ into the 
name.” Baptizing into the name has a twofold meaning. 1. 
Unto, denoting object or purpose, as eis petdvovav, unto repent 
ance (Matt. iii. 11); eis dpeow apaptidy, for the remission of 
sins (Acts ii. 38). 2. Into, denoting union or communion with, 
as Rom. vi. 3, “baptized into Christ Jesus ; into his death ;” 
i.e., we are brought by baptism into fellowship with his death. 
Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual 
and mystical union with him. Eis, into, is the preposition 
commonly used with baptize. See Acts viii. 16; xix. 3,551 
Cor. i. 13, 15; x.2; Gal. iii. 27. In Acts ii. 38, however, 
Peter says, “ Be baptized upon (ér) the name of Jesus Christ ; 
and in Acts x. 48, he commands Cornelius and his friends to be 
baptized én (év) the name of the Lord. To be baptized upon 
the name is to be baptized on the confession of that which the 
name implies: on the ground of the name; 80 that the name 
Jesus, as the contents of the faith and confession, is the ground 
upon which the becoming baptized rests. Jn the name (év) has 
reference to the sphere within which alone true baptism is ac- 
complished. The name is not the mere designation, a sense 
which would give to the baptismal formula merely the force of 


150 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XXVIIL 


a charm. The name, as in the Lord’s Prayer (“ Hallowed be 
thy name”), is the expression of the sum total of the divine 
Being: not his designation as God or Lord, but the formula in 
which all his attributes and characteristics are summed up. It 
is equivalent to his person. The finite mind can deal with him 
only through his name; but his name is of no avail detached 
from his nature. When one is baptized into the name of the 
Trinity, he professes to acknowledge and appropriate God in 
all that he is and in all that he does for man. He recognizes 
and depends upon God the Father as his Creator and Preserver ; 
receives Jesus Christ as his only Mediator and Redeemer, and 
his pattern of life; and confesses the Holy Spirit as his Sancti- 
fier and Comforter. 


Alway (mdoas ras tyuépas). Lit., all the days. Wyce., in all 
days. 


20. End of the world (cuvtedelas tod aidvos). Rev., in 
margin, and lit., consummation of the age. The current age is 
meant; and the conswmmation is coincident with the second 
coming of Christ, after the Gospel shall have been proclaimed 
throughout the world. “The Saviour’s mind goes no farther ; 
for after that, evangelizing work will cease. No man, after that, 
will need to teach his neighbor, saying, ‘ Know the Lord’”

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MARK. 





INTRODUCTION. 


Mark THE EvancE.ist is, by the best authorities, identified 
with John Mark, the son of Mary. The surname Mark was 
adopted for use among the Gentiles; Mark (J/arcus) being one 
of the commonest Latin names (compare Mareus Tullius Cic- 
ero, Marcus Aurelius), as John was one of the commonest 
Hebrew names. Mark wasa cousin of Barnabas, and was, from 
a very early period, the intimate friend and associate of Peter 
(Acts xii. 11-17), who affectionately refers to him as “my son” 
at the close of his first epistle. The general opinion of the 
fathers, as well as that of modern authorities, is that Mark drew 
the great mass of his materials from the oral discourses of Peter. 
This opinion was perpetuated in Christian art, in representa- 
tions of Peter seated on a throne with Mark kneeling before 
him and writing from his dictation; Mark sitting and writing, 
and Peter standing before him, with his hand raised, dictating ; 
and Peter in a pulpit, preaching to the Romans, and Mark tak- 
ing down his words in a book (see Mrs. Jameson, “Sacred and 
Legendary Art,” i., 149). 

This opinion finds support in the evidences of Peter’s in- 
fluence upon the style of this Gospel. The restlessness and im- 
petuosity of Mark’s disposition, of which we have hints in his 
forsaking Paul and Barnabas at Perga (Acts xili. 13; xv. 38), 
in his subsequent readiness to join them on the second mission- 
ary journey (Acts xv. 39), and, if the tradition be accepted, in 
his rushing into the street on the night of Christ’s arrest, clad 
only in a linen sheet (Mark xiv. 51, 52), would naturally be in 


154 INTRODUCTION TO MARK. 


sympathy with the well-known character of Peter. Peter was 
a man of observation and action rather than of reflection ; im- 
pulsive and impetuous. “When we assume,” says Dr. Mori- 
son, “that Mark drew directly from the discoursings of St. 
Peter, then we understand how it comes to pass that it is in his 
pages that we have the most particular account of that lament- 
able denial of his Lord of which the apostle was guilty. On 
no other person’s memory would the minute particulars of the 
prediction, and of its unanticipated fulfilment, be so indelibly 
engraven. It is also noteworthy that, while the very severe 
rebuke which our Lord administered to St. Peter in the neigh- 
borhood of Caesarea Philippi is faithfully and circumstantially 
recorded in Mark’s pages, the splendid eulogium and distin- 
guishing blessing, which had been previously pronounced, are, 
as it were, modestly passed by. Doubtless the great apostle 
would not be guilty of making frequent or egotistic references 
to such marks of distinction ” (“ Commentary on Mark ”). 
Unlike the other gospels, Mark’s narrative is not subordinated 
to the working out of any one idea. Matthew’s memoirs turn on 
the relation of Christ to the law and the prophets. He throws a 
bridge from the old economy to the new. His is the Gospel as 
related to the past, the Gospel of Christianity regarded as the 
fulfilment of Judaism. Luke exhibits Jesus as a Saviour, and 
expounds the freeness and universality of the Gospel, and the 
sacredness of humanity. John wrote that men might believe 
that Jesus is the Christ, and might have life in him. While 
Matthew and Luke deal with his offices, John deals with his 
person. John carries forward the piers of Matthew’s bridge 
toward that perfected heavenly economy of which his Apoca- 
lypse reveals glimpses. In Matthew Jesus is the Messiah ; in 
John, the Hternal Word. In Matthew he is the fulfiller of the 
law ; in John he foreshadows the grander and richer economy 
of the Spirit. ; 
Mark, on the other hand, is a chronicler rather than a his- 
torian. His narrative is the record of an observer, dealing 
with the facts of Christ’s life without reference to any domi- 
nant conception of his person or office. Christ’s portrait is 
drawn “in the clearness of his present energy ;” not as the 


INTRODUCTION TO MARK. 155 


fulfilment of the past, as by Matthew, nor as the foundation of 
the future, as by John. His object is to portray Jesus in his 
daily life, “in the awe-inspiring grandeur of his human per- 
sonality, as a man who was also the Incarnate, the wonder- 
working Son of God.” Hence his first words are the appro- 
priate keynote of his Gospel: ‘“ The beginning of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, the Son of God.” 

Such a narrative might have been expected from Peter, 
with his keen-sightedness, his habit of observation, and his 
power of graphically describing what he was so quick to per- 
ceive. There is, of course, less room for the exhibition of these 
traits in his epistles, though they emerge even there in certain 
peculiar and picturesque words, and in expressions which reflect 
incidents of his personal association with Christ. Those brief 
epistles contain over a hundred words which occur nowhere 
else in the New Testament. Certain narratives in the Book of 
Acts record incidents in which Peter was the principal or the 
only apostolic actor, and the account of which must have come 
from his own lips; and these narratives bear the marks of his 
keen observation, and are characterized by his picturesque 
power. Such are the accounts of the healing of the cripple at 
the temple-gate (iii.) ; of Ananias and Sapphira (v.) ; of Peter’s 
deliverance from prison (xii.); of the raising of Dorcas (ix.) ; 
and of the vision of the great sheet (x.). In these, especially if 
we compare them with narratives which Luke has evidently re- 
ceived from other sources, we are impressed with the picturesque 
vividness of the story; the accurate notes of time and place 
and number; the pictorial expressions, the quick transitions ; 
the frequent use of such words as straightway, immediately ; 
the substitution of dialogue for narrative, and the general ful- 
ness of detail. 

All these characteristics appear in Mark’s Gospel, and are 
justly regarded as indicating the influence of Peter, though 
comparatively few of the same words are employed by both; a 
fact which may be, in great part, accounted for by the differ- 
ence between a hortatory epistle and a narrative. The traces of 
Peter’s quick perception and dramatic and picturesque power are 
everywhere visible in Mark. While Matthew fully records the 


156 INTRODUCTION TO MARK. 


discourses of our Lord, Mark pictures his deeds. Hence, while 
Matthew gives us fifteen of his parables, Mark reproduces only 
four, and that in a condensed form. “ Mark does not wear 
the flowing robes of Matthew. His dress is ‘for speed suc- 
cinet.? Swift-paced, incisive, his narrative proceeds straight to 
the goal, like a Roman soldier on his march to battle.” His 
Gospel is the Gospel of the present, not of the past. His refer- 
ences to the Old Testament, with the exception of i. 2, 3, are 
quotations occurring in the discourses of Christ, or cited by 
others. They belong, as Canon Farrar observes, “to the nar- 
rative, not to the recorder” (xv. 28 is an interpolation). The 
word vdjos, law, never occurs in Mark nor in Peter. 

Mark’s is, therefore, pre-eminently the pictorial Gospel: the 
Gospel of detail. “There is,” says Canon Westcott, “ perhaps 
not one narrative which he gives in common with Matthew and 
Luke, to which he does not contribute some special feature.” 
Thus he adds to John the Baptist’s picture of loosing the shoe- 
latchet another touch, in the words to stoop down (i. 7). He 
uses a more graphic term to describe the opening of the 
heavens at Christ’s baptism. According to Matthew and Luke 
the heavens were opened (avedySnoav) ; Mark depicts them as 
rent asunder (oxfouévous; i. 10). Matthew and Luke repre- 
sent Jesus as led (dviy3n) into the wilderness to be tempted ; 
Mark as driven (é«Bddnre); adding, He was with the wild 
beasts ; to which some detect a reference in Peter’s comparison 
of the devil to a roaring lion (1 Pet. v. 8). He gives a realistic 
touch to the story of James and John forsaking their employ- 
ment at the call of Jesus, by adding that they left their father 
with the hired servants (i. 20). After the discourse from the 
boat to the multitude upon the shore, Mark alone tells us that 
the disciples sent away the multitude, and throws in the little 
details, they took him as he was; and there were with them 
other little ships (iv. 36). His account of the storm which fol- 
lowed is more vivid than Matthew’s or Luke’s. He pictures 
the waves beating into the boat, and the boat beginning ¢o fill ; 
notes the steersman’s cushion at the stern on which the sleep- 
ing Lord’s head reposed (iv. 37, 38); and throws the awaking 
by the disciples and the stilling of the tempest into a dramatic 


INTRODUCTION TO MARK. 157 


form by the distressful question, Master, carest thow not that 
we perish ? and the command to the sea as to a raging mon- 
ster, Peace! Be still! (iv. 38, 39). 

In the narrative of the feeding of the five thousand, only 
Mark relates the Saviour’s question, How many loaves have ye ? 
Go and see (vi. 88). An oriental crowd abounds in color, and 
to Mark we are indebted for the gay picture of the crowds ar- 
ranged on the green grass, in companies, like flower-beds with 
their varied hues. He alone specifies the division of the two 
fishes among them all (vi. 39, 41). He tells how Jesus, walk- 
ing on the sea, would have passed by the disciples’ boat ; he ex- 
presses their cry of terror at Christ’s appearance by a stronger 
word than Matthew, using the compound verb dvéxpafav where 
Matthew uses the simple verb éxpafav. He adds, they all saw 
him (vi. 48-50). When Jesus descends from the mount of trans- 
figuration, it is Mark that fills out the incident of the disciples’ 
controversy with the bystanders by relating that the scrobes were 
questioning with them. He notes the amazement which, for 
whatever reason, fell upon the people at Jesus’ appearance, their 
running to salute him, and his inquiry, What question ye with 
them? (ix. 14, 16). Mark gives us the bystanders’ encouragement 
of Bartimeus when summoned by Jesus, and tells how he cast off 
his outer garment and leaped up (x. 49, 50). He alone relates 
the breaking of the alabaster by the woman (xiv. 3), and Christ’s 
taking the little child in his arms after he had set him in the 
midst (ix. 36). 

In the account of the two demoniacs of Gadara, Matthew 
(viii.) relates that they were met coming out of the tombs, and 
that they were exceeding fierce, so that no one could pass that 
way. Mark mentions only one demoniac, but adds that he had 
his dwelling in the tombs (xatolenow elyev, stronger than 
Luke’s abode, éuevev) ; that the attempt had been made to fetter 
him, but that he had broken the fetters; and that he was day 
and night in the tombs and in the mountains, crying and cut- 
ting himself with stones (v. 3-6). In the interview with the 
lawyer who desired to know what kind of a commandment was 
great in the law, Matthew (xxii. 34-40) ends the dialogue with 
Jesus’ answer to this question. Mark gives the lawyer’s reply 


158 INTRODUCTION TO MARK. 


and his enlargement upon Jesus’ answer, the fact that Jesus 
observed that he answered discreetly, and his significant words, 
Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. 

It is interesting to compare the account of Herod’s feast and 
John the Baptist’s murder as given by Matthew and Mark re- 
spectively. Mark alone mentions the great banquet and the 
rank of the guests. He adds the little touches of Salome’s 
entering in and delighting the guests. He throws Herod’s 
promise and Salome’s request into dialogue. Where Matthew 
says simply, He promised with an oath to give her whatsoever 
she should ask, Mark gives it, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, 
and I will gwe tt thee. And he sware unto her, whatsoever 
thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my 
kingdom. The whole narrative is more dramatic than Matthew’s. 
Matthew says that Salome was put forward by her mother. 
Mark pictures her going out, and details her conversation with 
Herodias, and her entering in again with haste, and demanding 
the horrible boon forthwith. Mark also enlarges upon Herod’s 
regret: he was exceeding sorry; and where Matthew notes 
merely his compliance with the damsel’s request, Mark lets us 
into his feeling of unwillingness to refuse her. Mark, too, 
emphasizes the promptness of the transaction. Salome de- 
mands the Baptist’s head forthwith; Herod sends the exe- 
cutioner straightway. Mark alone mentions the executioner. 
While the dialogue is not peculiar to Mark, it is to be noted 
that it is characteristic of Peter’s style, so far, at least, as can be 
inferred from the stories in the book of Acts, of Ananias and 
Sapphira (v. 3-9), Cornelius (x.), and Peter’s deliverance from 
prison (xii.). 

Mark is peculiarly minute and specific as to details of persons, 
times, numbers, and places; a feature in which, also, he resem- 
bles Peter (compare Acts ii. 155; vi.3; iv. 22; v. 7, 23; xii. 4). 
Thus, of persons, “ They entered into the house of Simon and 
Andrew with James and John” (i. 29): “ Simon and they that 
were with him followed after him” (i. 36): “In the days of 
Alhwathar the high-priest” (ii. 26): “ The Pharisees took coun- 
sel with the Herodians” (iii. 6): “The woman was a Greek, a 
Syro-Phenician by nation” (vii. 26). Compare, also, xi. a 


INTRODUCTION TO MARK. 159 


xiii. 35 xv. 21. Of places: “A multitude from Galilee and 
Judaea,” etc. (iii. 7,8): The demoniac proclaimed his recovery 
in Decapolis (v. 20): Jesus departed “from the border of Z'yre 
and came through Sidon unto the Sea of Galilee, through the 
midst of the borders of Decapolis” (vii. 31). Compare viii. 10; 
xi, 1; xii. 41; xiv. 68. Of number : The paralytic was “ borne 
of four” (ii. 3): The swine were about two thousand (v. 18): 
The twelve were sent out two and two (vi. 7): The people sat 
down by hundreds and fifties (vi. 40): “Before the cock crow 
twice thou shalt deny me thrice” (xiv. 30). Of time: Jesus 
rose up i the morning, a great while before day (i. 35): “ The 
same day, when the even was come” (iv.35). Compare xi. 11; 
xiv. 68; xv. 25. 

But Mark does not confine himself to mere outward details. 
He abounds in strokes which bring out the feeling of his char- 
acters. He uses six different words expressive of fear, wonder, 
trouble, amazement, extreme astonishment. The compound 
éxdapBeiatar, greatly amazed, affrighted (ix. 15; xvi. 5, 6) oc- 
curs nowhere else in the New Testament. Thus the look and 
emotion of our Lord are portrayed: “ He looked round about on 
them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of their heart ” 
(ili. 5): “ He looked round about on them which sat round 
about him, and said, Behold my mother,” etc. (ili. 34): “ He 
looked round about” to see who had touched him in the crowd 
(v. 32): “ He marvelled because of their unbelief” (vi. 6): 
He looked on the young ruler and loved him (x. 21): He was 
moved with compassion toward the leper (i. 41): He sighed 
deeply m his spirit (viii. 12). 

Similarly Mark depicts the tender compassion of the Lord. 
A beautiful hint of his delicate and loving appreciation of an 
ordinary need closes the story of the healing of the ruler’s 
daughter. In their joy and wonder at her miraculous restora- 
tion, the friends would naturally forget the immediate practical 
demand for food, of which the Lord promptly reminds them by 
his command that something should be gwen her to eat (v. 48). 
Luke notes the same circumstance. In like manner his appre- 
ciation of his disciples’ weariness appears in the words, ‘‘ Come 
ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest awhile” (vi. 81). 


160 INTRODUCTION TO MARK. 


He is moved with compassion toward the multitude because they 
are as sheep without a shepherd (vi. 34): he is touched with 
the need and fatigue of the many who had come from far (viii. 
3): he shows his interest in the condition of the epileptic lad 
by inquiring into the history of his case (ix. 21): he is much 
displeased at the disciples’ rebuke of those who are bringing the 
young children to him (x. 14). 

In like manner Mark describes the mental and emotional 
states of those who were brought into contact with Christ. Those 
who witnessed the miracle of the loaves wnderstood not, and 
their heart was hardened (vi. 52): the disciples were perplexed, 
questioning among themselves what the rising again from the 
dead showld mean (ix. 10): they were amazed at his words 
about a rich man entering into the kingdom of heaven (x. 24): 
a sudden and mysterious awe fell upon them in their journey to 
Jerusalem (x. 32): Pilate marvelled at Jesus being already dead, 
and sent for the centurion in order to ask whether he had been 
any while dead (xv. 44). Compare i. 22, 27; v. 20, 42; vi. 
90; vii. 87; xi. 18. He depicts the interest excited by the 
words and works of Christ ; describing the crowds which flocked 
to him, and their spreading abroad the fame of his power 
(28,45; ii. 18; iii. 20, 215 iv. 13 .v. 20, 21,245 ‘vi. 315 vii: 
36). 

We find in Mark certain peculiarly forcible expressions in our 
Lord’s language, such as, “ Z’o them that are without” (iv. 11); 
“ Ye leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradi- 
tion of men” (vii. 8) ; ‘ This adulterous and sinful generation ” 
(viii. 88); “ Be set at nought” (ix. 12); “ Queckly to speak evil 
of me” (ix. 39); “ Shall receive brethren and sisters and moth- 
ers,” etc., “ with persecutions ” (x. 30). 

His narrative runs. His style abounds in quick transitions. 
The word etJéws, straightway, occurs in his Gospel something 
like forty times. He imparts vividness to his narration by the 
use of the present tense instead of the historic (i. 40, 44; ii. 3, 
sq.; xi. 1, 2,7; xiv. 48, 66). He often defines his meaning by 
coupling similar words or phrases. Beelzebub is called by two 
names (iii. 22), and by a third (iii. 830): The sick are brought a¢ 
even, when the sun ded set (i. 32): The blasphemer hath no more 


INTRODUCTION TO MARK. 161 


Sorgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin (iti. 29): He spake 
with many parables, and without a parable he spake not (iv. 33, 
34). Compareili. 5, 27; v. 26; vi. 25; vii. 21. He employs 
over seventy words which are found nowhere else in the New 
Testament. We find him preserving the identical Aramaic 
words uttered by the Lord. In his Gospel alone occur Boaner- 
ges (ili. 17); Talitha cumi (v. 41); Korban (vii. 11); ph- 
phatha (vii. 34); and Abba (xiv. 86). Writing for Romans we 
find him transferring certain Latin words into Greek, such as 
legio, legion (v. 9); centurio, xevtuplov, centurion, which else- 
where is éxatovtapyos—yns (xv. 39); guadrans, farthing (xii. 
42) ; jlagellare, to scourge (xv. 15); speculator, executioner (vi. 
27); census, tribute (xii. 14); sextarius, pot (vii. 4); praetorium 
(xv. 16). Three of these, centurio, speculator, and sextarius are 
found in his Gospel only. He always addsa note of explanation 
to Jewish words and usages. 

His style is abrupt, concise, and forcible; his diction less 
pure than that of Luke and John. Besides irregularities of 
construction which cannot be explained to the English reader, 
he employs many words which are expressly forbidden by the 
grammarians, and some of which are even condemned as slang. 
Such are éoydtws eyes, as at the point of death (v. 28); xpad8Ba- 
tos, bed (ii. 4, 9, 11, 12); povepIarpos, with one eye (ix. 47); 
KodduBiotat, money-changers (xi. 15); Kopacvov, maid (v. 41); 
opKivw, I adjure (v. 7); pamicpa, a blow of the hand (xiv. 65) ; 
padpioos, needle (x. 25). 

I have described the characteristics of Mark at some length, 
because they lie peculiarly in the line of the special purpose of 
this book, which deals with individual words and phrases, and 
with peculiarities of diction, rather than with the exegesis of 
passages. Of this Gospel it is especially true that its pecu- 
liar flavor and quality cannot be caught without careful verbal 
atudy. It is a gallery of word-pictures. Reading it, even in 
the familiar versions, we may discover that it is, as Canon 
Westcott remarks, “essentially a transcript from life;” but 
nothing short of an insight into the original and individual 
words will reveal to us that the transcript itself is alive.

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MARK. 





CHAPTER I. 


1. Beginning (apy), without the article, showing that the 
expression is a kind of title. It is the beginning, not of his 
book, but of the facts of the Gospel. He shows from the 
prophets that the Gospel was to begin by the sending forth of a 
forerunner. 


3. A voice (¢av7). No article as A. V. and Rev., “ the 
voice.” It has a sort of exclamatory force. Listening, the 
prophet exclaims, Lo / a vovece. 


4. John did baptize (éyévero "Iwdvyns 0 Bartitwr).  Lit., 
John came to pass or arose who baptized. Rev., John came 
who baptized. 


Baptism of repentance (Sdmrticya petavoias). A bap- 
tism the characteristic of which was repentance; which in- 
volved an obligation to repent. We should rather expect Mark 
to put this in the more dramatic form used by Matthew: Say- 
ing, Repent ye ! 


5. There went out (eferopevero). The imperfect tense 
signifies, there kept goung out. 


The river. Peculiar to Mark. 


Confessing. See on Matt. iii. 6. 


Cz. 1.) MARK. 163 


6. With camels’ hair (tpéyas xaunrov). Lit., havs. Not 
with a camel’s skin, but with a vesture woven of camels’ hair. 
Compare 2 Kings 1, 8. 


Wild honey. ‘“ The innumerable fissures and clefts of the 
limestone rocks, which everywhere flank the valleys, afford in 
their recesses secure shelter for any number of swarms of wild 
bees ; and many of the Bedouin, particularly about the wilder- 
ness of Judaea, obtain their subsistence by bee-hunting, bring- 
ing into Jerusalem jars of that wild honey on which John the 
Baptist fed in the wilderness” (Tristram, ‘Land of Israel ”). 
Wyc., honey of the wood. 


7. To stoop down. A detail peculiar to Mark. 
And unloose. Compare éo bear ; Matt. iii. 11. 


10. Straightway. A favorite word with Mark. See In- 
troduction. 


Opened (ay:fouévous). Lit., as Rev., rent asunder: much 
stronger than Matthew’s and Luke’s avedyInoav, were opened. 


11. Thou art my beloved son. The three synoptists give 
the saying in the same form: Thou art my son, the beloved. 


12. Driveth him (é«BddAde). Stronger than Matthew’s 
aviyIn, was led wp, and Luke’s jyero, was led. See on Matt. 
ix. 38. It is the word used of our Lord’s expulsion of demons, 
Mark i. 34, 39. 


The Wilderness. The place is unknown. Tradition fixes 
it near Jericho, in the neighborhood of the Quarantania, the 
precipitous face of which is pierced with ancient cells and chap- 
els, and a ruined church is on its topmost peak. Dr. Tristram 
says that every spring a few devout Abyssinian Christians are 
in the habit of coming and remaining here for forty days, to 
keep their Lent on the spot where they suppose that our Lord 
fasted and was tempted.

13. With the wild beasts. Peculiar to Mark. The region 
just alluded to abounds in boars, jackals, wolves, foxes, leop- 
ards, hyenas, ete. 


15. The time (0 «acpos). That is, the period completed by 
the setting up of Messiah’s kingdom. Compare the fulness of 
the tume, Gal. iv. 4. 


Repent. See on Matt. iii. 2; xxi. 29. Mark adds, and be- 
lieve in the Gospel. 


16. Casting a net (a4u¢iBarrovras). See on Matt. iv. 18. 
Mark here uses, more graphically, only the verb, without add- 


ing net. Lit., throwing about in the sea. Probably a fisher- 
man’s phrase, like @ cast, a haul. 


17. To become (yevéoSa:). An addition of Mark. 
19. A little farther. Added by Mark. 
Mending. See on Matt. iv. 21. 


20. With the hired servants. Peculiar to Mark. It may 
imply that Zebedee carried on his business on a larger scale 
than ordinary fishermen. 


22. He taught (%v d:dacKcwv). The finite verb with the par- 
ticiple denoting something continuous: was teaching. 


23. Straightway. At the conclusion of his teaching. 
With an unclean spirit (€v mvedpare axatdaptm). Lit., “im 
an unclean spirit.” ‘Ev (in) has the force of in the power of. 


Dr. Morison compares the phrases in drink, in love. 


24, Us. Me and those like me. “The demons,” says 
Bengel, “make common cause.” 


Cx. 1.) MARK. 165 


The Holy One of God. The demon names him as giving to 
the destruction the impress of hopeless certainty. 


25. Hold thy peace (deuoSnrv). Lit., be muzzled or gagged. 
See on Matt. xxii. 12. 


26. Had torn (o7apdgav). Rev., tearing, convulsions in mar- 
gin. Luke has had thrown him down in the midst. Mark adds 
the crying out with a loud voice. 


27. They questioned among themselves (cuv{yreiv pos 
éavtovs). Stronger than Luke, who has they spake together. 
Tynd., They demanded one of another among themselves. 


30. Lay sick of a fever (xatéxevtro wupéccovea). Kara, 
prostrate. Mark adds, they tell him of her. Luke, they besought 
him for her. Mark, he came to her. Luke, he stood over her. 
Mark only, he took her by the hand and raised her up. 


32. At even, when the sun did set. An instance of Mark’s 
habit of coupling similar words or phrases. 


That were sick. See on Matt. iv. 23, 24. 


34. Devils (8acucma). The Rev., unfortunately, and against 
the protest of the American committee, retains devils instead of 
rendering demons. See on Matt.iv.1. The New Testament uses 
two kindred words to denote the evil spirits which possessed men, 
and which were so often cast out by Christ: da/uwv, of which 
demon is a transcript, and which occurs, according to the 
best texts, only at Matt. viii. 31; and davporiov, which is not a 
diminutive, but the neuter of the adjective datpovos, of, or be- 
longing to a demon. The cognate verb is datpovitouat to be 
possessed with a demon, as in Mark i. 82. 

The derivation of the word is uncertain. Perhaps Safw, to 
distribute, since the deities allot the fates of men. Plato de- 
rives it from Sanpwvr, knowing or wise. In Hesiod, as in Pythag- 
oras, Thales, and Plutarch, the word da/uor is used of men of 


166 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. L 


the golden age, acting as tutelary deities, and forming the link 
between gods and men. Socrates, in Plato’s “ Cratylus,” quotes 
Hesiod as follows: “ Socrates: You know how Hesiod uses the 
word? Hermogenes: Indeed I do not. Soc.: Do you not re- 
member that he speaks of a golden race of men who came first ? 
Her.: Yes, I know that. Soc.; He says of them, 


‘But now that fate has closed over this race, 
They are holy demons upon earth, 
Beneficent, averters of ills, guardians of mortal men.’” 


After some further conversation, Socrates goes on: ‘“ And 
therefore I have the most entire conviction that he called them 
demons, because they were danpoves (knowing or wise). Now, 
he and other poets say truly that, when a good man dies, 
he has honor and a mighty portion among the dead, and be- 
comes a demon, which is a name given to him signifying 
wisdom. And I say, too, that every wise man who happens to 
be a good man is more than human (davuérov) both in life and 
death, and is rightly called a demon.” Mr. Grote (“ History 
of Greece”) observes that in Hesiod demons are “ invisible 
tenants of the earth, remnants of the once happy golden race 
whom the Olympic gods first made—the unseen police of the 
gods, for the purpose of repressing wicked behavior in the 
world.” In later Greek the word came to be used of any de- 
parted soul. 

In Homer éaiuwv is used synonymously with Jeds and Jed, 
god and goddess, and the moral quality of the divinity is deter- 
mined by the context: but most commonly of the divine pow- 
er or agency, like the Latin nwmen, the deity considered as a 
power rather than as a person. Homer does not use dasudriov 
substantively, but as an adjective, always in the vocative case, 
and with a sorrowful or reproachful sense, indicating that the 
person addressed is in some astonishing or strange condition. 
Therefore, as a term of reproach—wretch ! sirrah ! madman! 
(“‘Hiad,” ii., 190, 200; iv., 31; ix., 40). Occasionally in an ad- 
miring or respectful sense (“ Odyssey,” xiv., 448; xxiii., 174) ; 
Fiecellent stranger! noble sir! omer also uses Saipwrv of 
one’s genius or attendant spirit, and thence of one’s lot or, fort- 


Cu. 1] MARK. 167 


une. So in the beautiful simile of the sick father (“ Odyssey,” 
v., 396), “Some malignant genius has assailed him.” Compare 
“Odyssey,” x., 64; xi, 61. Hence, later, the phrase xara 
Saépova is nearly equivalent to by chance. 

We have seen that, in Homer, the bad sense of Saxpovios is 
the prevailing one. In the tragedians, also, da(uwv, though 
used both of good and bad fortune, occurs more frequently in 
the latter sense, and toward this sense the word gravitates more 
and more. The undertone of Greek thought, which tended to 
regard no man happy until he had escaped from life (see en 
Matt. v. 3, blessed), naturally imparted a gloomy and forbidding 
character to those who were supposed to allot the destinies of 
life. 

In classical Greek it is noticeable that the abstract ro daspovioy 
fell into the background behind da/uev, with the development 
in the latter of the notion of a fate or genius connected with 
each individual, as the demon of Socrates; while in biblical 
Greek the process is the reverse, this doctrine being rejected 
for that of an overruling personal providence, and the strange 
gods, “obscure to human knowledge and alien to human life,” 
taking the abstract term uniformly in an evil sense. 

Empedocles, a Greek philosopher, of Sicily, developed He- 
siod’s distinction; making the demons of a mixed nature be- 
tween gods and men, not only the link between the two, but 
having an agency and disposition of their own; not immortal, 
but long-lived, and subject to the passions and propensities of 
men. While in Hesiod the demons are all good, according to 
Empedocles they are both bad and good. This conception re- 
lieved the gods of the responsibility for proceedings unbecom- 
ing the divine nature. The enormities which the older myths 
ascribed directly to the gods—thefts, rapes, abductions—were 
the doings of bad demons. It also saved the credit of the old 
legends, obviating the necessity of pronouncing either that the 
gods were unworthy or the legends untrue. “ Yet, though de- 
vised for the purpose of satisfying a more scrupulous religious 
sensibility, it was found inconvenient afterward when assail- 
ants arose against paganism generally. For while it abandoned 
as indefensible a large portion of what had once been genuine 


168 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. I. 


faith, it still retained the same word demons with an entirely 
altered signification. The Christian writers in their controver- 
sies found ample warrant among the earlier pagan authors for 
treating all the gods as demons; and not less ample warrant 
among the dater pagans for denouncing the demons generally as 
evil beings ” (Grote, “‘ History of Greece”). 

This evil sense the words always bear in the New Testament 
as well as in the Septuagint. Demons are synonymous with 
unclean spirits (Mark v. 12, 15; iii. 22, 80; Luke iv. 33). They 
appear in connection with Satan (Luke x. 17, 18; xi. 18, 19); 
they are put in opposition to the Lord (1 Cor. x. 20, 21); to the 
faith (1 Tim. iv. 1). They are connected with idolatry (Apoc. 
ix. 20; xvi. 13, 14). They are special powers of evil, influenc- 
ing and disturbing the physical, mental, and moral being (Luke 
xii. 11,16; Mark v. 2-5; vii. 25; Matt. xii. 45). 


33. All the city was gathered together at the door. 
Peculiar to Mark. 


35. A great while before day (vvya). Lit., while tt was 
an the night. The word is peculiar to Mark. 


36. Followed after (xared/w£av). The word found only in 
Mark. Simon and his companions, as well as the people of the 
city, seem to have been afraid lest he should have permanently 
left them. Hence the compound verb indicates that they fol- 
lowed him eagerly ; pursued him as if he were fleeing from 
them. Simon, true to his nature, was foremost in the pursuit : 
Simon, and they that were with him. 


37. All. All the people of Capernaum, all are seeking thee. 
The continuous present tense. So Rev., better than A. V. The 
alt is peculiar to Mark. 


38. Towns (xwpordreus). Lit., village-towns, suburban towns, 


41. Moved with compassion. Only Mark, 


Cu. IL] MARK. 169 


43. Strictly charged (€uBpiunoduevos). Rev., sternly, in 
margin. The word is originally to snort, as of mettlesome 
horses. Hence, to fret, or chafe, or be otherwise strongly 
moved ; and then, as a result of this feeling, to admonish or re- 
buke urgently. The Lord evidently spoke to him peremptorily. 
Compare sent him out (€&éBanrer) ; lit., drove or cast him out. 
The reason for this charge and dismissal lay in the desire of 
Jesus not to thwart his ministry by awaking the premature vio- 
lence of his enemies ; who, if they should see the leper and 
hear his story before he had been officially pronounced clean by 
the priest, might deny either that he had been a leper or had 
been truly cleansed. 


45. The city. Properly, as Rev., a city; any city. 


CHAE Eee ls. 


1. lt was noised (nxovcIn). Lit., i was heard. 


That he was in the house (67: eis oixdv éotw). The dru, 
that, is recitative, introducing the report in the direct form. 
Lt was reported—he is in the house! The preposition dn is lit- 
erally ito, carrying the idea of the motion preceding the stay 
in the house. ‘‘ He has gone into the house, and is there.” But 
the best texts read év olxkm, m the house. The account of this 
rumor is peculiar to Mark. 


He preached (éAdAev). Lit., spake, as Rev. Imperfect tense. 
He was speaking when the occurrence which follows took place. 


3. Borne of four. A detail peculiar to Mark. 
4. Come nigh unto him (spoceyyicar). The word does 


not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. But some read 
mpoceveyxat, bring him unto him. So Rev., in margin. 


170 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IL 


They uncovered (amecréyacay). The only use of the word 
in New Testament. 


Broken it up (é£opvEavres). Lit., scooped it out. Very 
graphic and true to fact. A modern roof would be untiled or 
unshingled ; but an oriental roof would have to be dug to 
make such an opening as was required. A composition of 
mortar, tar, ashes, and sand is spread upon the roofs, and rolled 
hard, and grass grows in the crevices. On the houses of the 
poor in the country the grass grows more freely, and goats 
may be seen on the roofs cropping it. In some cases, as in 
this, stone slabs are laid across the joists. See Luke v. 19, 
where it is said they let him down through the tiles ; so that 
they would be obliged, not only to dig through the grass and 
earth, but also to pry up the tiles. Compare Ps. cxxix. 6. 


The bed (xpdéBarrov). One of Mark’s Latin words, graba- 
tus, and condemned by the grammarians as inelegant. A rude 
pallet, merely a thickly padded quilt or mat, held at the cor- 
ners, and requiring no cords to let it down. They could easily 
reach the roof by the steps on the outside, as the roof is low ; 
or they could have gone into an adjoining house and passed 
along the roofs. Some suppose that the crowd was assembled 
in an upper chamber, which sometimes extended over the whole 
area of the house. It is not possible accurately to reproduce 
the details of the scene. Dr. Thomson says that Jesus probably 
stood in the dewan or reception-room, a hall which is entered 
from the court or street by an open arch; or he may have 
taken his stand in the covered court in front of the house itself, 
which usually has open arches on three sides, and the crowd 
was around and in front of him. 


6. Reasoning (dvaroyifouevor). The word dialogue is de- 
rived from this, and the meaning literally is, that they held a 
dialogue with themselves. 


8. Perceived (ézvyvovs). The preposition éi gives the 
force of fully. He was not only zmmediately aware of their 
thought, but clearly and fully aware. 


Cx. IL] MARK. 171 


9. Walk (vepirdres). Lit., walk about. 


10. Power (€£ovciav) ; or better, authority, as Rev., in mar- 
gin. The word is derived from éfeor1, ot ts permitted or lawful. 
It combines the ideas of right and might. Authority or right 
is the dominant meaning in the New Testament. 


13. Resorted—taught (ijpyero—édidackxev). The imper- 
fects are graphic—kept coming, kept teaching. 


14. See on Matt. ix. 9. 
15. His house. Levi’s. See Luke v. 29. 


16. Scribes and Pharisees. But the best texts read 
ypappateis Tov Papioaiwv, scribes of the Pharisees. So Rev. 
Scribes belonging to the sect of the Pharisees. They had fol- 
lowed him into the hall where the company were seated. This 
hall answered to the Adwah of Arabian houses, which is thus 
described by William Gifford Palgrave: “The /’hawah was a 
long, oblong hall about twenty feet in height, fifty in length, 
and sixteen or thereabouts in breadth. The walls were covered 
in a rudely decorative manner with brown and white wash, and 
sunk here and there into small triangular recesses, destined to 
the reception of books, lamps, and other such like objects. The 
roof was of timber, and flat; the floor was strewn with fine, 
clean sand, and garnished all round alongside of the walls with 
long strips of carpet, upon which cushions, covered with faded 
silk, were disposed at suitable intervals. In poorer houses, felt 
rugs usually take the place of carpets” (“ Central and Eastern 
Arabia”). 


17. They that are whole (oi icxvovres).  Lit., they that are 
strong. See on Luke xiv. 30, was not able; and 2 Pet. ii. 11, 


pow". 


No need. The Greek order throws the emphasis on these 
words: Wo need have they that are strong of a physician. 


172 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. II. 


Wyc., Whole men have no need to a leech, but they that have

18. And of the Pharisees. But the of is wrong. Read as 
Rev., John’s disciples and the Pharisees. 


Used to fast (jcav vnotevovtes). The A. V. refers to the 
fact as a custom; but Mark means that they were observing a 
fast at that time. Wence the use of the participle with the 
finite verb. Rev., correctly, were fasting. The threefold repe- 
tition of the word fast is characteristic of Mark. See Intro- 
duction. 


19. Children of the bride-chamber (viot rod vupdavos). 
More correctly as Rev., sons. Itis noteworthy that Christ twice 
uses a figure drawn from marriage in his allusions to John the 
Baptist, the ascetic. Compare John iii. 29. The sons of the 
bride-chamber are different from the groomsmen. They are 
the guests invited to the bridal. The scene is laid in Galilee, 
where groomsmen were not customary, as in Judaea. Hence 
there is no mention of them in the account of the marriage at 
Cana. In Judaea there were at every marriage two grooms- 
men or friends of the bridegroom. See on John iii. 29. 


20. Then—in those days. The proper reading is év éxetvyn 
TH npépa, in that day. So Rev. Another of Mark’s double 
expressions: then—in that day. 


21. Seweth (éippamrec). A word found in Mark only. 
Matthew (ix. 16) and Luke (v. 36) use émuBannreu, throweth upon, 
as we speak of clapping a patch upon. 


23. He went (avtov raparopeverdau). Lit., went along be- 
sede, along the stretches of standing grain. Matthew and Luke 
use dud, through, as Mark does, but not mapa. 


Began, as they went, to pluck (%p£avro oddv rovety TiAXov- 
tes). Lit., began to make a way plucking the ears. This does 


Cu. IL] MARK. iS 


not mean that the disciples broke a way for themselves through 
the standing corn by plucking the ears, for in that event they 
would have been compelled to break down the stalks. They 
could not have madea way by plucking the heads of the grain. 
Mark, who uses Latin forms, probably adopted here the phrase 
ater facere, to make a way, which is simply to go. The same 
idiom occurs in the Septuagint, Judges xvii. 8; moufoas odov 
avtov, ashe journeyed. The offence given the Pharisees was 
the preparation of food on the Sabbath. Matthew says Zo eat, 
stating the motive, and Luke, rubbing with thew hands, de- 
scribing the act. See on Matt. xii. 2. The Rev. rightly re- 
tains the rendering of the A. V. 


25. Had need. Mark adds this to the was an hungered, 
which is in both Matthew and Luke. The analogy lay in the 
necessity. The had need is generic; the was hungry is spe- 
cific, describing the peculiar character of the need. 


26. The shewbread (rods dptous tis mpodécews). Lit., the 
loaves of proposition, i.e., the loaves which were set forth before 
the Lord. The Jews called them the loaves of the face, i.e., of 
the presence of God. The bread was made of the finest wheaten 
flour that had been passed through eleven sieves. There were 
twelve loaves, or cakes, according to the number of tribes, 
ranged in two piles of six each. Each cake was made of about 
five pints of wheat. They were anointed in the middle with oil, 
in the form of a cross. According to tradition, each cake was 
five hand-breadths broad and ten long, but turned up at either 
end, two hand-breadths on each side, to resemble in outline the 
ark of the covenant. The shewbread was prepared on Friday, 
unless that day happened to be a feast-day that required sab- 
batical rest ; in which case it was prepared on Thursday after- 
noon. The renewal of the shewbread was the first of the 
priestly functions on the commencement of the Sabbath. The 
bread which was taken off was deposited on the golden table in 
the porch of the sanctuary, and distributed among the outgoing 
and incoming courses of priests (compare save for the priests). 
It was eaten during the Sabbath, and in the temple itself, but 


174 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Ca. TIL 


only by such priests as were Levitically pure. This old bread, 
removed on the Sabbath morning, was that which David ate. 


27. For man (Sua). On account of, or for the sake of. This 
saying is given by Mark only. 


CHAPTER III. 


1. A withered hand (é&npaypévny tHv xetpa). More cor- 
rectly Rev., Ats hand withered. The participle indicates that 
the withering was not congenital, but the result of accident or 
disease. Luke says his right hand. 


2. They watched (apernpovv). Imperfect tense. They 
kept watching. The compound verb, with zrapd, by the side of, 
means to watch carefully or closely, as one who dogs another’s 
steps, keeping beside or near him. Wyc., They aspieden him : 
iLe., played the spy. On tnpéw, to watch, see on John xvii. 12. 


He would heal (Jeparevces). Future tense: whether he 
will heal, the reader being placed at the time of the watching, 
and looking forward to the future. 


3. Stand forth (éyeupe eis Td écov). Lit., rise into the midst. 
So Wyce., Lise ento the middle. Tynd., Arise and stand in the 
midst. 


5, Being grieved (avddviovpevos), Why the compound 
verb, with the preposition ovv, together with? Herodotus (vi., 
39) uses the word of condoling with another's misfortune. 
Plato (“‘ Republic,” 462) says, ““When any one of the citizens 
experiences good or evil, the whole state will either rejoice or 
sorrow with him (EvAdvrjceta). The ody therefore implies 
Christ’s condolence with the moral misfortune of these hard- 
hearted ones. Compare the force of con, in condolence. Latin, 
con, with, dolere, to grieve. 


Cu. III.] MARK. 175 


Hardness (zapece). From mapos, a kind of marble, and 
thence used of a caldus on fractured bones. Il@pawous is origi- 
nally the process by which the extremities of fractured bones are 
united by a callus. Hence of callousness, or hardness in general. 
The word occurs in two other passages in the New Testament, 
Rom. xi. 25; Eph. iv. 18, where the A. V. wrongly renders 
blindness, following the Vulgate caecitas. It is somewhat 
strange that it does not adopt that rendering here (Vulgate, 
caecitate) which is given by both Wyc. and Tynd. The Rev. 
in all the passages rightly gives hardening, which is better than 
hardness, because it hints at the process going on. Mark only 
records Christ’s feeling on this occasion. 


7. Withdrew. Mark alone notes no less than eleven occa- 
sions on which Jesus retired from his work, in order to escape 
his enemies or to pray in solitude, for rest, or for private confer- 
ence with his disciples. See i. 12; iii. 7; vi. 81, 463 vii. 24, 
oie ike Le RIY. oF. 


A great multitude (odd 7AF30s). Compare ver. 8, where 
the order of the Greek words is reversed. In the former case 
the greatness of the mass of people is emphasized ; in the latter, 
the mass of people itself. 


8. He did (ézroée:). Imperfect tense. Others read zrovei, he 
is doing. In either case the tense has a continuous force: what 
things he was doing or is doing. Note in vv. 7, 8, Mark’s 
accurate detail of places. See Introduction. The reasons for 
our Lord’s withdrawing into a boat, given with such minute- 
ness of detail in vv. 9-11, are also peculiar to Mark. 


10. Pressed upon (émimimrew). Lit., fell upon. 


Plagues (uwdotuyas). Lit., scowrges. Compare Acts xxii. 
24; Heb. xi. 36. Our word plague is from wrnyy, Latin plaga, 
meaning a blow. Pestilence or disease is thus regarded as a 
stroke from a divine hand. IIAnyn is used in classical Greek 
in this metaphorical sense. Thus Sophocles, “ Ajax,” 279: “I 


176 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IIL. 


fear that a calamity (any) is really come from heaven (Jeod, 
god).” So of war. Aeschylus, “ Persae,” 251: “O Persian 
land, how hath the abundant prosperity been destroyed by a 
single blow (€v mid mnyh). The word here, scowrges, carries 
the same idea. 


11. The unclean spirits (ra). The article indicating those 
particular spirits which took part in that scene. Mark’s preci- 
sion is shown in the use of the two articles and in the arrange- 
ment of the noun and adjective: The spirits, the unclean ones. 


When they saw (éray é9eépovv). More accurately as Rev., 
whenever they beheld. The imperfect tense denotes a repeated 
act. The dy in érav gives an indefinite force: as often as they 
might see him. 


12. He charged (ésreriua). The word is commonly rendered 
rebuke in the New Testament. In classical Greek its predom- 
inant sense is that of severe, strenuous reproach for unworthy 
deeds or acts. It is several times used in the New Testament, 
as here, in the sense of charge. In this sense the word carries, 
at bottom, a suggestion of a charge under penalty (Tim7). 


That (iva). According to the A. V. and Rev. the that indi- 
cates the substance of Christ’s charge. Properly, however, it 
indicates the intent of his charge. He charged them im order 
that they should not make him known. 


13. Whom he would (ods 4Iedev adds). Rev., more strictly, 
“whom he humself would ;” not allowing any to offer them- 
selves for special work. Out of the larger number thus called 
he selected twelve. See ver. 14. 


14. Ordained (érofaev). Lit., made. Rev., appointed. 


Might send them forth (amocré\Ay). As apostles. Com- 
pare the kindred noun dzréatonXou, apostles. 


Cu. If.) MARK. 177 


15. To have power (éyew é€ovciav). Note that he does not 
say to preach and to cast out, but to preach and to have author- 
aty to cast out. The power of preaching and the power of ex- 
orcising were so different that special mention is made of the 
divine authority with which they would need to be clothed. The 
power of driving out demons was given that they might apply 
it in confirmation of their teaching. Compare xvi. 20. 


16. And Simon he surnamed Peter. Mark relates only 
his naming and not his appointment, leaving his appointment 
to be understood. 


17. Although Mark mentions that the apostles were sent out 
in pairs (vi. 7), he does not classify them here in pairs. But 
he alone throws Peter and James and John, the three who 
shared the Lord’s particular intimacy, into one group. Matthew 
and Luke both introduce Andrew between Peter and James. 


He surnamed them Boanerges (érré9nxev aitots dvoya 
Boavnpyés). Lit., he put upon them the name. Some uncer- 
tainty attaches to both the origin and the application of the 
name. Most of the best texts read dvduata, names, instead of 
name. This would indicate that each of the two was surnamed 
a “son of thunder.” Some, however, have claimed that it was 
a dual name given to them as a pavr, as the name Dioscurt was 
given to Castor and Pollux. The reason of its bestowal we do 
not know. It seems to have been intended as a title of honor, 
though not perpetuated like the surname Peter, this being the 
only instance of its occurrence; possibly because the incon- 
venience of a common surname, which would not have suffi- 
ciently designated which of them was intended, may have hin- 
dered it from ever growing into an appellation. It is justified 
by the impetuosity and zeal which characterized both the 
brothers, which prompted them to suggest the calling of fire 
from heaven to consume the inhospitable Samaritan village 
(Luke ix. 54); which marked James as the victim of an early 
martyrdom (Acts xii. 2); and which sounds in the thunders of 
John’s Apocalypse. The Greek Church calls John Bpovtédwvos, 

12 


178 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. IT. 


the thunder-voiced. The phrase, sons of, is a familiar Hebrew 
idiom, in which the distinguishing characteristic of the indi- 
vidual or thing named is regarded as his parent. Thus sparks 
are sons of fire (Job v.71); threshed corn is son of the floor (Isa. 
xxi. 10). Compare son of perdition (John xvii. 12); sons of 
disobedience (Eph. ii. 2; v. 6). 


18. Andrew (AvSpéav). A name of Greek origin though 
in use among the Jews, from avyjp, man, and signifying manly. 
He was one of the two who came earliest to Christ (Matt. iv. 
18, 20; compare John i. 40, 41) ; and hence is always styled by 
the Greek fathers rpwtoxAntos, first called. 


Philip (@/urov). Another Greek name, meaning fond of 
horses. In ecclesiastieal legend he is said to have been a 
chariot-driver. 


Bartholomew. A Hebrew name—Bar Tolmai, son of 
Tolmai. Almost certainly identical with Nathanael. Philip 
and Nathanael are associated by John, as are Philip and Bar- 
tholomew in the parallel passages of the synoptics. Bartholo- 
mew is not mentioned in John’s list of the twelve (xxi. 2), but 
Nathanael is; while the synoptists do not mention Nathanael 
in their lists, but do mention Bartholomew. Probably he had 
two names. 


Matthew. See on the superscription of Matthew’s Gospel. 


Thomas. A Hebrew name, meaning twin, and translated 
by the Greek Didymus (John xi. 16). 


Thaddaeus or Lebbaeus, as in Matt.x.3. He is the Judas 
of John xiv. 22. Luther calls him der fromme Judas (the good 
Judas). The two surnames, Lebbaeus and Thaddaeus, mean 
the same thing—beloved child. 


Simon the Canaanite. Properly, Cananaean. See on 
Matt. x. 4: “No name is more striking in the list than that of 


Cx. II.) MARK. 1798 


Simon the Zealot, for to none of the twelve could the contrast 
be so vivid between their former and their new position. What 
revolution of thought and heart could be greater than that 
which had thus changed into a follower of Jesus one of the 
fierce war-party of the day, which looked on the presence of 
Rome in the Holy Land as treason against the majesty of 
Jehovah, a party who were fanatical in their Jewish strictures 
and exclusiveness ¢” (Geikie, “ Life and Words of Christ”). 


19. Judas Iscariot. See on Matt. x. 4. 


20. Again. Glancing back to the many notices of crowds 
in the preceding narrative. This reassembling of the multi- 
tudes, and its interference with the repast of Christ and the dis- 
ciples, is peculiar to Mark. 


21. His friends (oi rap’ avtod). Lit., they who were from 
beside him: 7.e., by origin or birth. His mother and brethren. 
Compare vv. 31, 32. Wyc., kimsmen. Tynd., they that be- 
longed unto him. Not his disciples, since they were in the 
house with him. 


They said (édeyov). Imperfect tense. Very graphic, they 
kept saying. 


22. Beelzebub. See on Matt. x. 25. 


And. Notconnecting two parts of one accusation, but two 
accusations, as is evident from the two 67vs, which are equiva- 
lent to quotation marks. 


24. And. Note the way in which the sayings are linked by 
this conjunction ; an impressive rhetorical progression. 


96. But hath an end. Peculiar to Mark. 


27. Spoil (Suapraca). Mark uses the stronger and more 
vivid compound verb, where Matthew employs the simple dp- 


180 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IV. 


adoat. The verb means, primarily, to tear in pieces ; to carry 
away, as the wind; to efface, as footsteps. So, generally, to 
seize as plunder, snatching right and left. 


His goods (ra oxetn). Lit., his vessels. So Wyc. Compare 
Mark xi. 16; Acts ix. 15; x. 11; 2 Tim. ii. 20. The special 
object of the robber may be precious vessels of gold or silver ; 
but the word is probably used in its general sense of household 
gear. 


28. Compare Matt. xii. 31; and note Mark’s superior preci- 
sion and fulness of detail. 


29. Guilty (@&oyos). From éy, in, éye, to hold or have. Lit., 
is in the grasp of, or holden of. Compare i Cor. xi. 27; James 
Tie 0: 


Eternal damnation (aiwviov duaptnuaros). An utterly false 
rendering. Rightly as Rev., of an eternal sim. So Wyc., ever- 
lasting trespass. The A. V. has gone wrong in following Tyn- 
dale, who, in turn, followed the erroneous text of Erasmus, 
xpioews, judgment, wrongly rendered damnation. See Matt. 
xxiii. 88, and compare Rev. there. 


30. They said (édeyov). Imperfect tense. Zhey kept saying, 
or persisted in saying. An addition peculiar to Mark. 


31, 32. They sent unto him calling him, and a multitude 
was sitting about him. Detail by Mark only; as also the 
words in ver. 34, Looking round on them which sat round 
about him. 


CHAPTER IV. 
1. Again. He had taught there before. See iii. 7-9.

graphic use of the present, “ There 2s gathered.” So Rev. 


Cu. IV.] MARK. 181 


7. Choked (cuvérméav). The preposition, suv = con (to- 
gether), carries the idea of com-pression. 


It yielded no fruit. Added by Mark. 


8. That sprang up and increased (avaS8aivovta kai avfav- 
éuevov). The Rey. literally renders the participles, growing up 
and inereasing, thus describing the process more vividly. These 
two participles, moreover, explain the use of the imperfect 
tense éd/Sou (yielded), denoting continuance. It began to yield 
and kept yielding as it increased. 


Thirty (es tpudxovra). Lit., wp to thirty. 
10. When he was alone. Mark only. 


They that were about him with the twelve. Mark only. 
Matthew and Luke, the disciples. 


11. Unto them that are without (éxelvoss tots é&w). The 
two latter words are peculiar to Mark. The phrase means 
those outside of our circle. Its sense is always determined by 
the contrast to it. Thus, 1 Cor. v. 12, 13, it is non-Christeans in 
contrast with me. Col. iv. 5, Christians contrasted with people 
of the world. Compare 1 Thess. iv. 12; 1 Tim. iii. 7. Mat- 
thew (xiii. 11), with less precision, uses simply éxetvous (to them), 
the pronoun of remote reference. Luke viii. 10, rots Novos (to 
the rest). 


13. Peculiar to Mark. 


Parables (rds mapaBords). The parables, which I have 
spoken or may hereafter speak. 


14. The sower soweth the word. More precise than 
either Matthew or Luke. Compare Matt. xiii. 19; Luke viii. 11. 


19. The lusts of other things entering in (ai epi ra 
Aouad éeriIuuia).  Lusts, not in the limited sense of mere 


182 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IV. 


sexual desire, but in the general sense of longing. ‘The word 
is also used of desire for good and lawful things (Luke xxii. 
15; Philip. i. 28). 


20. Such as. A good rendering of the pronoun oérwes, 
which indicates the class of hearers. 


21. A candle (6 Avyvos). Properly, the damp, as Rev. 


Brought (pyeraz). Lit., cometh. Doth the lamp come ? 
This impersonation or investing the lamp with motion is ac- 
cording to Mark’s lively mode of narrative, as is the throwing 
of the passage into the interrogative form. Compare Luke 
viii. 16. Zhe lamp: the article indicating a fameliar household 
implement. So also “¢he bed” and “ the stand.” 


Bushel (uodsov). The Latin modius. One of Mark’s Latin 
words. See on Matt. v.15. The modus was nearer a peck 
than a bushel. 


Bed (xAivnv). A couch for reclining at table. 


Candlestick (Avyviav). Rev., correctly, stand ; i.e., lamp- 
stand. See on Matt. v. 15. 


22. Which shall not be manifested (éav uu) va gavepwI4). 
The A. V. makes Christ say that every hidden thing shall be 
revealed. This is wrong. He says that things are hidden in 
order that they may be manifested. Concealment is a means to 
revelation. 


26-29. Tur PARABLE OF THE SEED GROWING SECRETLY. Pe- 
culiar to Mark. 


26. Should cast (GaAn). Lit., should have cast, the aorist 
tense, followed by the presents sleep and rise (kaJevdn and 
éyeipntat). The whole, literally, “ As if a man should have cast 
seed into the ground, and showld be sleeping and rising night 


Cu. IV.] MARK. 183 


and day.” The aorist tense indicates the stngte act of casting ; 
the presents the repeated, continued sleeping and rising while 
the seed is growing. 


Seed (tov omdpov). The seed; that particular seed which 
he had to sow. Such is the force of the article. 


27. Grow (unkvvnta). Lit., lengthen; be extended by the 
seed lengthening out into blade and stalk. 


He knoweth not how (as ov« oidev adrés). The Greek 
order is very lively: how knoweth not he. 


28. Of herself (avtouarn). Lit., self-acting. It occurs in 
only one other passage of the New Testament, Acts xii. 10; of 
the city gate which opened to Peter of tts own accord. 


29. Is brought forth (rapaéoz). This rendering cannot be 
correct, for the verb is active, not passive, meaning to deliver 
up. Uence it is usually explained, shall have delivered itself 
up to harvest ; which is stilted and artificial. Rev. ds ripe, is 
a free rendering from the margin of A. V. It is, perhaps, 
better to explain, as Meyer does, whose rendering is adopted by 
Rey. in margin: When the fruit shall have allowed, i.e., shall 
have admitted of being harvested. Xenophon and Herodotus 
use the word in the sense of permit or allow; and an exact 
parallel to this occurs in the historian Polybius (xxii., 24, 9): 
“ When the season permitted” (mrapadibovens). 


Putteth in (azrocré\nrer). —Lit., sendeth forth. So Rey. in 
margin. The rendering, putteth im, misses the figure. The 
verb is the same as that used of sending forth the apostles to 
reap the harvest of souls. See especially John iv. 38: “I sent 
(amréctevAa) you to reap.” 


30. Peculiar to Mark. 


With what comparison shall we compare it? (év rive 
avtiy TapaBorn Idpev ;). Lit., In what parable might we put 


184 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IV. 


it? Rev., In what parable shall we set it forth? Note the 
we, taking the hearers, with a fine tact, into consultation. 


31. When it is sown (67av oraph). This phrase is repeated 
in ver. 32. Here the emphasis is on étav, when. It is small 
at the time when it is sown. In ver. 32 the emphasis is on 
oraph, it is sown. It begins to grow great from the time when 
at 2s sown. 


That are upon the earth. A little detail peculiar to Mark. 
32. Groweth up. Mark only. 


Herbs (rav Aaydvov). Rev., rightly, the herbs ; those which 
people are wont to plant in their gardens. The word denotes 
garden—or pot-herbs, as distinguished from wild herbs. 


Shooteth out great branches (rove? kdAddous peyddovs). 
Lit., maketh, etc. Rev., putteth out. Peculiar to Mark. Mat- 
thew has becometh a tree. On branches, see note on Matt. xxiv. 
32. One of the Talmudists describes the mustard-plant as a 
tree, of which the wood was sufficient to cover a potter’s shed. 
Another says that he was wont to climb into it as men climb 
into a fig-tree. Professor Hackett says that on the plain of 
Akka, toward Carmel, he found a collection of mustard-plants 
from six to nine feet high, with branches from each side of a 
trunk an inch or more in thickness. Dr. Thomson relates that 
near the bank of the Jordan he found a mustard-tree more than 
twelve feet high. 


Lodge (xaracxnvotv). See on Matt. viii. 20. Lit. pitch 
their tents. 


33. Such. Implying that Mark knew yet more parables that 
were spoken at that time. 


As they were able to hear it. Peculiar to Mark. 


Cu. IV.] MARK. 185 


36. Even as he was in the ship. Rev., boat. Just as he 
was, in the boat in which he was then sitting. Mark adds the 
detail about the accompanying boats. 


37. Storm (Aaiday). So Luke. Distinctively a furious 
storm or hurricane. Compare Septuagint, Job xxxviii. 1 Of 
the whirlwind out of which God answered Job. See, also, Job 
xxi. 18. Matthew uses cevcyds, a shaking. See on Matt. viii. 
24. Mr. Macgregor (“Rob Roy on the Jordan ”) says that “on 
the sea of Galilee the wind has a singular force and suddenness ; 
and this is no doubt because that sea is so deep in the world 
that the sun rarefies the air in it enormously, and the wind, 
speeding swiftly above a long and level plateau, gathers much 
force as it sweeps through flat deserts, until suddenly it meets 
this huge gap in the way, and it tumbles down here irresistible.” 


38. A pillow (76 rpocxepddrasov). The definite article indi- 
cates a well-known part of the boat’s equipment—the coarse 
leathern cushion at the stern for the steersman. The Anglo- 
Saxon version has bolster. 


39. Peace, be still (ciara, mediywao). Lit., be silent! be 
muzzled! Wyc., rather tamely, wax dumb ! How much more 
vivid than the narratives of either Matthew or Luke is this per- 
sonification and rebuke of the sea as a raging monster. 


Ceased (éxdracev). From xézros, meaning, 1, beating; 2, 
tol ; 3, weariness. A beautiful and picturesque word. The 
sea sank to rest as if exhausted by its own beating. 


There was (éyévero). More strictly, there arose or ensued. 
The aorist tense indicates something émmediate. Tynd. has 
followed. 

Calm. Wyc., peaceableness. 


41. They feared exceedingly (€poBjIncav $ébPov peyav). 
Lit., they feared a great fear. 


186 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. V. 


What manner of man is this ? (ris dpa obTds éorw ;). The 
A. V. is rather a rendering of Matthew’s rotamés, what man- 
ner of (viii. 27), than of Mark’s ris, who. The Rev. gives it 
rightly : Who then is this? The then (dpa) is argumentative. 
Since these things are so, who then is this ? 


CHAPTER V. 


3. The details of vv. 8-5 are peculiar to Mark. “The pict- 
ure of the miserable man is fearful; and in drawing it, each 
evangelist has some touches which are peculiarly his own; but 
St. Mark’s is the most eminently graphic of all, adding, as it 
does, many strokes which wonderfully heighten the terribleness 
of the man’s condition, and also magnify the glory of his cure” 
(Trench, “ Miracles ”). 


Dwelling (catoicnow). The cata, down, gives the sense of 
a settled habitation. Compare our phrase settled down. So 
Tynd., his abiding. 


The tombs (tots uvjuacw). “In unclean places, unclean 
because of the dead men’s bones which were there. To those 
who did not on this account shun them, these tombs of the Jews 
would afford ample shelter, being either natural caves or re- 
cesses hewn by art out of the rock, often so large as to be sup- 
ported with columns, and with cells upon their sides for the 
reception of the dead. Being, too, without the cities, and 
oftentimes in remote and solitary places, they would attract those 
who sought to flee from all fellowship of their kind” (Trench, 
** Miracles”). 


4, With fetters and chains (7édais cal ddvoeowv). médn, 
fetter, is akin to 7é€a, the instep; just as the Latin pedica, a 
shackle, is related to pes, a foot. The Anglo-Saxon plural of 
fot (foot) is fet ; so that fetter is feeter. So Chaucer : 


‘“‘The pure fetters on his shinnes grete 
Were of his bitter salte teres wete.” 


“Anvors (derivation uncertain) is a chain, a generic word, denot- 
ing a bond which might be on any part of the body. 


Cu. V.] MARK. 187 


Broken in pieces (cuvrerpipIar). The verb cvvtp/B means 
originally to rub together, to grind or crush. It has been sug- 
gested that the fetters might have been of cords which could 
be rubbed to pieces. Wye. renders, Had broken the stocks to 
small gobbets. 


5. Crying (xpafwv). Rev., crying out. The verb denotes 
an inarticulate cry ; a shriek. Aristophanes uses it of the frogs 
(“ Ranae,” 258), and of the bawling of a boor (‘‘ Equites,” 285). 


6. Afar off (a7ro waxpode_ev), Peculiar to Mark, as is also he 
ran. 


7. Crying—he saith. The inarticulate ery (ver. 5), and then 
the articulate speech. 


What have I to do with thee ? (ti éuol Kal col ;). Lit., what 
as there to me and thee? What have we in common ? 


| adjure thee by God. Stronger than Luke’s J pray thee. 
The verb opkiSw, I adjure, is condemned by the grammarians 
as inelegant. 


8. For he said (édeyev). Imperfect tense, he was saying ; 
the force of which is lost both in the A. V. and Rev. Theim- 
perfect gives the reason for this strange entreaty of the demon. 
Jesus was commanding, was saying “ come out ;” and, as in the 
case of the epileptic child at the Transfiguration Mount, the 
baffled spirit wreaked his malice on the man. The literal ren- 
dering of the imperfect brings out the simultaneousness of 
Christ’s exorcism, the outbreak of demoniac malice, and the cry 
Torment me not. 


13. Ran (dpynoev). The verb indicates hasty, headlong mo- 
tion. Hence, as Rev., rushed. 


Two Thousand. As usual, Mark alone gives the detail of 
number. 


188 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. V. 


A steep place. But the noun has the definite article: rod 
cpnuvod, the steep, as Rev. 


15. See (Jewpodcw). Rev., rightly, behold. For it was more 
than simple seeing. The verb means looking stedfastly, as one 
who has an interest in the object, and with a view to search into 
and understand it: to look inguwiringly and intently. 


Clothed. Compare Luke viii. 27. Hor a long time he had 
worn no clothes. 


18. When he was come (éuBaivovros avrov). The participle 
is in the present tense. Not after he had embarked, but whzle 
he was im the act. Hence Rev., rightly, as he was entering. 
With this corresponds the graphic imperfect srapexader: While 
he was stepping into the boat the restored man was beseeching 
him. 


That (fa). Ln order that. Not the subject but the aim of 
the entreaty. 


23. My little daughter (ro duvydrpiov). This little endear- 
ing touch in the use of the diminutive is peculiar to Mark. 


Lieth at the point of death (éoydrws ye). One of the 
uncouth phrases peculiar to Mark’s style, and which are cited by 
some as evidence of the early composition of his gospel. 


I pray thee come (iva éd3@v). The words J pray thee are 
not in the Greek. Literally the ruler’s words run thus: My lit- 
tle daughter lieth at the point of death—that thou come, ete. In 
his anguish he speaks brokenly and incoherently. 


He went (amfrdev). Lit., went away. The aorist tense, 
denoting action once for all, is in contrast with the imperfects, 
nkonovset, kept following, and cvvé9rBov, kept thronging. The 
multitude kept following and thronging as he went along. The 
preposition ovv, together, in the latter verb, indicates the wnited 


Cu. V.j MARK. 189 


pressure of a crowd. Compare Tynd., ver. 31. Zhrusting thee 
on every side. 


26. Mark is much fuller and more vivid than Matthew or 
Luke. 


Had suffered (aJovca). To be taken, as everywhere in the 
New Testament, in the sense of suffering pain, not merely sub- 
jected to treatment. What she may have suffered will appear 
from the prescription for the medical treatment of such a com- 
plaint given in the Talmud. “Take of the gum of Alexandria 
the weight of a zuzee (a fractional silver coin); of alum the 
same; of crocus the same. Let them be bruised together, and 
given in wine to the woman that has an issue of blood. If this 
does not benefit, take of Persian onions three logs (pints) ; boil 
them in wine, and give her to drink, and say, ‘ Arise from thy 
flux.’ If this does not cure her, set her in a place where two 
ways meet, and let her hold a cup of wine in her right hand, and 
let some one come behind and frighten her, and say, ‘ Arise 
from thy flux.’ But if that do no good, take a handful of cum- 
min (a kind of fennel), a handful of crocus, and a handful of 
fenugreek (another kind of fennel). Let these be boiled in wine 
and give them her to drink, and say, ‘ Arise from thy flux!’” 
If these do no good, other doses, over ten in number, are 
prescribed, among them this: “ Let them dig seven ditches, in 

, which let them burn some cuttings of vines, not yet four years 
old. Let her take in her hand a cup of wine, and let them lead 
her away from this ditch, and make her sit down over that. And 
let them remove her from that, and make her sit down over an- 
other, saying to her at each remove, ‘Arise from thy flux!’” 
(Quoted from Lightfoot by Geikie, “ Life and Words of Christ”). 


Of many physicians (70). Lit., wnder; i.e, under the 
hands of. 


And was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse. 
Luke’s professional pride as a physician kept him from such a 
statement. Compare Luke viii. 43.

28. For she said (éAeyev). Imperfect tense. She was or 
kept saying as she pressed through the crowd, either to herself 
or to others. 


29. She knew—she was healed. Note the graphic change 
in the tenses. éyvw, she knew; idra, she ts healed. 


Plague. See on iii. 10. 


30. Knowing (ézruyvods). Rev., percewing. Lit., having 
Sully known. 


That virtue had gone out of him (tiv é& adtod Stvayw 
éfehJovaav). More correctly as Rev., that the power proceeding 
Srom him had gone forth. The object of the Saviour’s knowl- 
edge was thus complex: Ist, hes power ; 2d, that his power had 
gone forth. This and the following sentence are peculiar to 
Mark. 


32. He looked round about (mrepueBrérrero). Imperfect 
tense. He kept looking around for the woman, who had hidden 
herself in the crowd. 


34. In peace (eis ecpnvnv). Lit., into peace. Contemplating 
the peace in store for her. Mark alone adds, Be whole of thy 
plague. 


35. From the ruler of the synagogue. From his house ; 
for the ruler himself is addressed. 


Troublest (aves). See on Matt. ix. 36. Compare Luke 
xi. 22, where occurs the cognate word oxdaAa, spoils, things torn 
or stripped from an enemy. Wye., trawailest. Tynd., dis- 
easest. 


36. Heard. This is from the reading deotoas (Luke viii. 50). 
The correct reading is wapaxovoas, which may be rendered 
either not heeding, as Rev. (compare Matt. xviii. 17), or over- 


Cu. VL] MARK. 191 


hearing, as Rev. in margin, which, on the whole, seems the 
more natural. Disregarding would be more appropriate if the 
message had been addressed to Jesus himself; but it was ad- 
dressed to the ruler. Jesus overheard it. The present parti- 
ciple, Aadovpevor, being spoken, seems to fall in with this. 


38. Seeth (Sewpe?). Rev., deholdeth. See on ver. 15. 


Wailing (aAaddfovras). A descriptive word of the hired 
mourners crying al-a-lai ! 


40. Put them out. ‘ Wonderful authority in the house of 
a stranger. He was really master of the house” (Bengel). 
Only Mark relates the taking of the parents with the three dis- 
ciples into the chamber. 


41. Maid (xopdovv). Not a classical word, but used also by 
Matthew. 


42. Astonishment (éxkordce). Better Rev., amazement, 
which carries the sense of bewilderment. "Exoraots, of which 
the English ecstasy is a transcript, is from é«, out of, and 
iornpt, to place or put. Its primitive sense, therefore, is that 
of removal ; hence of a man removed out of his senses. In 
Biblical Greek it is used in a modified sense, as here, xvi. 8; 
Luke v. 26; Acts iii. 10, of amazement, often coupled with fear. 
In Acts x. 10; xi. 5; xxii. 17, it is used in the sense of our 
word ecstasy, and is rendered trance. 


CHAPTER VI. 
2. Astonished. See on Matt. viii. 28. 
Mighty works (duvdpeus). Lit., powers. See on Matt. xi. 


20. Tynd., virtues. Outcomings of God’s power: “ powers of 
the world to come” (Heb. vi. 5), at work upon the earth.

3. The carpenter. This word “throws the only flash 
which falls on the continuous tenor of the first thirty years, 
from infancy to manhood, of the life of Christ ” (Farrar, “ Mes- 
sages of the Books ”). 


They were offended. See on Matt. v.29. Tynd., hurt. 
5. Sick (appecros). From a, not, and padvvups, to strengthen. 
Sickness regarded as constitutional weakness. 


7. By two and two. To help and encourage each other, 
and also for fulness of testimony. 


8-12. See Matt. x. 


14. Was spread abroad. “ But for the rumor, Herod would 
not have known of him. A palace is late in hearing spiritual 
news” (Bengel). 


Mighty works do show forth themselves in him (évep- 
yovow ai Suvvdpers ev ato). Rev., these powers work in him. 
As Dr. Morison observes, “A snatch of Herod’s theology and 
philosophy.” He knew that John wrought no miracles when 
alive, but he thought that death had put him into connection 
with the unseen world, and enabled him to wield its powers. 


16. He is risen. The he, obros, is emphatic. This one. 
This very John. 


17-29. On the peculiarities of Mark in this narrative, see In- 
troduction. 


19. Had a quarrel against him (éveZtyev adv). There is 
some dispute about the rendering. The Rev. renders Set herself 
against him, with no alternative translation in the margin; 
and in Luke xi. 53, Press wpon him vehemently, with set them- 
selves against him in the margin. I see no objection to ren- 
dering was angry at him, taking évetyev adT@ with an ellipsis 


Cu. VI.J MARK. 193 


of yorov, anger. Very literally, had within herself (év) anger 
against him. So Herodotus, i., 118. Astyages concealing the 
anger (tov x0dov) which he felt toward him (oi évetye). vi. 
119, évetye odi Sewvov yorov, nourished a fierce anger against 
them. So Moulton, Grimm, and De Wette. 


Desired (jIedev). Imperfect tense, was desiring all along. 
Her demand for John’s murder was the result of a long-cherished 
wish. 


20. Observed him (cuveryjper). A mistranslation. Rev., 
kept him safe. Peculiar to Mark. Compare Matt. ix. 17, are 
preserved ; Luke ii. 19, kept ; ovv, closely ; tnpeiv, to preserve 
or keep, as the result of guarding. See on John xvii. 12, and 
reserved, 1 Pet. i. 4. 


Did many things (zoAXa ézrole). The proper reading, how- 
ever, is y7déper; from a, not, and mopos, a passage. Hence, 
strictly, to be in circumstances where one cannot find a way 
out. So Rev., rightly, he was much perplexed. The other 
reading is meaningless. 


21. Convenient (evxaipov). Mark only. Convenient for 
Herodias’ purpose. ‘ Opportune for the insidious woman, who 
hoped, through wine, lust, and the concurrence of sycophants, 
to be able easily to overcome the wavering mind of her hus- 
band” (Grotius in Meyer). 


Birthday. See on Matt. xiv. 6. The notice of the banquet 
and of the rank of the guests is peculiar to Mark. 


Lords (weytoraow). Only here, and Apoc. vi. 153; xviii. 23. 
A late word, from péyas, great. 


High captains (yrAvdpyos). Lit., commanders of a thou- 
sand men. Answering to a Roman military tribune. Both 
civil and military dignitaries were present, with other distin- 
guished men of the district (chzef men). 

13 


194 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VL 


22. The said Herodias (airis ris “Hpwodiddos). The A. V. 
misses the point of adrjs by the translation the sacd : the object 
being not to particularize the Herodias just referred to, but to 
emphasize the fact that Herodias’ own daughter was put for- 
ward instead of a professional dancer. Hence Rev., correctly, 
“the daughter of Herodias herself.” 


Damsel (xopaciw). See on Mark vy. 41. 


25. Mark’s narrative emphasizes the eager haste with which 
the murder was pushed. She came in straightway and de- 
manded the boon forthwith. 


By and by (é€avrfs). Obsolete in the old sense of zmme- 
diately. The A. V. translates etdvs, straightway, in Matt. xiii. 
21, by and by : etSéws, Mark iv. 17, immediately : and the same 
word in Luke xxi. 9, by and by. °*Eéavuris is rendered emme- 
diately, Acts x. 83; xi. 11: straightway, Acts xxiii. 30: pres- 
ently, Philip. ii. 28. Rev., forthwith. The expression by and 
by in older English was sometimes used of place. Thus Chau- 


cer. 
“Right in the same chamber by and by” (close by). 


and 
‘“Two young knights lying by and by” (near together). 


Edward IV. is reported to have said on his death-bed: “I wote 
(know) not whether any preacher’s words ought more to move 
you than I that is going by and by to the place that they all 
preach of.” 


Charger. See on Matt. xiv. 8. 
26. Exceeding sorry. Where Matthew has sorry. 


27. Mark’s favorite straightway. The king is prompt in his 
response. 


Executioner (c7exovhdropa). One of Mark’s Latin words, 
speculator. A speculator was a guardsman, whose business it 


Cu. VL] MARK. 195 


was to watch or spy out (speculart). It came gradually to de- 
note one of the armed body-guard of the Roman emperor. 
Thus Suetonius says of Claudius that he did not dare to attend 
banquets unless his speculutores with their lances surrounded 
him. Seneca uses the word in the sense of executioner. “He 
met the executioners (speculatortbus), declared that he had 
nothing to say against the execution of the sentence, and then 
stretched out his neck.” Herod imitated the manners of the 
Roman court, and was attended by a company of speculatores, 
though it was not their distinctive office to act as executioners. 
Wye. renders man-killer, and Tynd. hangman. 


29. Corpse. See on Matt. xxiv. 28. 

Stier (“ Words of Jesus”) says of Herod: “This man, whose 
inner life was burnt out ; who was made up of contradictions, 
speaking of his kingdom like Ahasuerus, and yet the slave of 
his Jezebel ; willingly hearing the prophet, and unwillingly kill- 
ing him ; who will be a Sadducee, and yet thinks of a resurrec- 
tion ; who has a superstitious fear of the Lord Jesus, and yet a 
curiosity to see him.” 


31. Come apart. See on ch. iii. 7. 


37. Shall we go and buy, etc. This question and Christ’s 
answer are peculiar to Mark. 


39. By companies (cuprécta cuprrécia). Peculiar to Mark. 
The Jewish dining-room was arranged like the Roman: three 
tables forming three sides of a square, and with divans or 
couches following the outside line of the tables. The open end 
of the square admitted the servants who waited at table. This 
explains the arrangement of the multitude here described by 
Mark. The people sat down, literally, a table-companies, ar- 
ranged like guests at table ; some companies of a hundred and 
some of fifty, in squares or oblongs open at one end, so that the 
disciples could pass along the inside and distribute the loaves. 


Green. Mark only. 


av 


196 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. Vi 


40. In ranks (rpacial mpaciai). Lit., ike beds in a garden. 
The former adverb, by companies, describes the arrangement ; 
this the color. The red, blue, and yellow clothing of the poor- 
est orientals makes an Eastern crowd full of color; a fact which 
would appeal to Peter’s eye, suggesting the appearance of flower- 
beds in a garden. 


41. Brake and gave (xaréxXacer, édiSov). The verbs are in 
different tenses; the former in the aorist, the latter in the im- 
perfect. The aorist implies the emstantaneous, the imperfect 
the continuous act. He brake, and kept gwing out. Farrar re- 
marks that the multiplication evidently took place in Christ’s 
hands, between the acts of breaking and distributing, 


All. Peculiar to Mark. 
Were filled. See on Matt. v. 6. 


43. Baskets full (codivwv mrnpopata). Lit., fillings of 
baskets. See on Matt. xiv. 20. Mark alone adds, and of the 
Jishes. 


44, Men (avdpes). Not generic, including men and women, 
but literally men. Compare Matt. xiv. 21, beside women and 
children ; a detail which we should have expected from Mark. 


46. When he had sent them away (dzrotafaevos). Rev., 
more correctly, after he had taken leave. Unzclassical, and used, 
in this sense only in later Greek. So in Luke ix. 61; Acts 
xviii. 18; 2 Cor. ii. 18. 


48. He saw (idov). Participle. Rev., seeing. Better, how- 
ever, the literal having seen. It was this which induced him to 
go to them. 


Toiling (Gacavifopuévous). Lit., tormented. Rev., distressed. 
See on Matt. iv. 24. Wye. travailing. Tynd., troubled. 


Fourth watch. Between 3 and 6 a.m. 


Cu. VI.] MARK. 197 
Would have passed by them. Peculiar to Mark. 
50. They all saw him. Peculiar to Mark. 


Spake with them (€AdAncev per’ ai’tdv). Both Matthew 
and John give the simple dative, avrots, to them. Mark’s with 
them is more familiar, and gives the idea of a more friendly 
and encouraging address. It is significant, in view of Peter’s 
relation to this gospel, that Mark omits the incident of Peter’s 
walk on the waves (Matt. xiv. 28-31). 


51. Ceased. See on Mark iv. 38. 


Sore amazed (Alav é« mepicaod éEictavto). Lit., exceedingly 
beyond measure. A strong expression peculiar to Mark. ’E&ic- 
Tavto, were amazed. Compare the cognate noun ékotaots, and 
seeon Mark v. 42. 


52. Peculiar to Mark. 


The miracle of the loaves (é7i rofs dprous). Rev., concern- 
ing the loaves. Lit., upon; in the matter of. They did not 
reason from the multiplying of the loaves to the stilling of the 
sea. 


53. Drew to the shore (mpocwppicdncav). Peculiar to 
Mark. Rev., moored to the shore, though the meaning may be 
near the shore. “AvéBn, he went up (ver. 51), seems to indicate a 
vessel of considerable size, standing quite high out of the water. 
They may have anchored off shore. 


55. Ran round. From place to place where the sick were, 
to bring them to Jesus. Matthew has they sent. 


Carry about (zrepipépevv). rept, about; one hither and an- 
other thither, wherever Christ might be at the time. 


Beds (xpaBdrros). Condemned as bad Greek, but used by 
both Luke and John. See on Mark ii. 4.

2. Defiled (xowais). Lit., comvmon ; and so Rey. in margin, 
Wyc., and Tynd. 


That is. Added by way of explanation to Gentile readers. 


Oft (avy). Rev., dilegently. A word which has given 
critics much difficulty, and on which it is impossible to speak 
decisively. The Rev. gives in the margin the simplest mean- 
ing, the literal one, weth the jist; that is, rubbing the un- 
cleansed hand with the other doubled. This would be satisfac- 
tory if there were any evidence that such was the custom in 
washing; but there is none. Edersheim ( Life and Times of 
Jesus,” ii., 11, note) says “the custom is not in accordance with 
Jewish law.” But he elsewhere says (“The Temple,” 206, 
note), “ For when water was poured upon the hands they had 
to be lifted, yet so that the water should neither run up above 
the wrist, nor back again upon the hand; best, therefore, by 
doubling the fingers intoa fist. Hence (as Lightfoot rightly re- 
marks) Mark vii. 3, should be translated except they wash their 
hands unth the fist.” Tischendorf, in his eighth edition, retains an 
ancient reading, muxva, frequently or diligently, which may go 
to explain this translation in so many of the versions (Gothic, 
Vulgate, Syriac). Meyer, with his usual literalism gives with 
the jist, which I am inclined to adopt. 


Holding (xparodvres). Strictly, holding jirmly or fast. So 
Heb. iv. 14; Apoe. ii. 25; denoting obstinate adherence to thé 
tradition. 


Cx. VII.) MARK. 199 


4. Wash themselves (Samricwvra:). Two of the most im- 
portant manuscripts, however, read pavticwvra., sprinkled them- 
selves. See Rev.,in margin. This reading is adopted by West- 
cott and Hort. The American Revisers insist on bathe, instead 
of wash, already used as a translation of viafwvras (ver. 3). The 
scope of this work does not admit of our going into the endless 
controversy to which this word has given rise. It will be sufti- 
cient to give the principal facts concerning its meaning and 
usage. 

In classical Greek the primary meaning is to merse. Thus 
Polybius (i., 51, 6), describing a naval battle of the Romans and 
Carthaginians, says, “ They sank (éBam7vfov) many of the ships.” 
Josephus (“ Jewish War,” iv., 3,3), says of the crowds which 
flocked into Jerusalem at the time of the siege, “ They over- 
whelmed (€Barticay) the city.” In a metaphorical sense Plato 
uses it of drunkenness: drowned in drink (BeBarricpévos, 
“ Symposium,” 176); of a youth overwhelmed (Bamrifopevov) 
with the argument of his adversary (“ Euthydemus,” 277). 

In the Septuagint the verb occurs four times: Isa. xxi, 4, 
Terror hath frighted me. Septuagint, Iniquity baptizes me 
(Barrifer) ; 2 Kings v.15, of Naaman’s dipping himself in 
Jordan (éBarticato); Judith xii. 7, Judith washing herself 
(€Barrigfero) at the fountain ; Sirach xxxi. 25, being baptized 
(Bamrifopuevos) from a dead body. 

The New Testament use of the word to denote submersion 
for a religious purpose, may be traced back to the Levitical 
washings. See Levit. xi. 32 (of vessels); xi. 40 (of clothes) ; 
Num. viii. 6, 7 (sprinkling with purifying water); Exod. xxx, 
19, 21 (of washing hands and feet). The word appears to have 
been at that time the technical term for such washings (compare 
Luke xi. 88; Heb. ix. 10; Mark vii. 4), and could not therefore 
have been limited tothe meaning immerse. Thus the washing 
of pots and vessels for ceremonial purification could not have 
been by plunging them in water, which would have rendered 
impure the whole body of purifying water. The word may be 
taken in the sense of washing or sprinkling. 

“The Teaching of the Apostles ” (see on Matt. x. 10) throws 
light on the elastic interpretation of the term, in its directions 


200 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. VII. 


for baptism. “Baptize—in living (i.e., running) water. But 
if thou hast not living water, baptize in other water; and if 
thou canst not in cold, then in warm. But if thou hast neither, 
pour water upon the head thrice into the name of the Father, 
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit” (Chap. VIL.). 


Pots (feorav). Another of Mark’s Latin words, adapted from 
the Latin seatarius, a pint measure. Wyc., cruets. Tynd., 
cruses. 


Brazen vessels (yadxiwv). More literally, copper. 


Tables (cAwav). Omitted in some of the best manuscripts 
and texts, and by Rev. The A. V. is a mistranslation, the 
word meaning couches. If this belongs in the text, we cer- 
tainly cannot explain Bamricpovs as wmmersion. 


6. Well (cards). Finely, beautifully. Ironical. 


10. Honor. Wye. has worship. Compare his rendering of 
Matt. vi. 2, “ That they be worshipped of men;” xiii. 57, “A 
prophet is not without worship but in his own country ;” and 
especially John xii. 26, “ If any man serve me, my Father shall 
worship him.” 


Die the death (Javdt@ rerevtdtw). Lit., come to an end by 
death. See on Matt. xv. 4. 


11. Corban. Mark only gives the original word, and then 
translates. See on Matt. xv. 5. 


13. Making of none effect. Rev., making void. See on 
Matt. xv. 6. 


Ye handed down. Note the past tense, identifying them 
for the moment with their forefathers. Compare Matt. xxiii. 
35, Ye slew. Christ views the Jewish persecutors and bigots, 
ancient and modern, as a whole, actuated by one spirit, and 
ascribes to one section what was done by another. 


Cu. VIL] MARK. 201 


17. The disciples. Matthew says Peter. There is no dis- 
crepancy. Peter spoke for the band. 


18. So. So unintelligent as not to understand what I uttered 
to the crowd. 


19. Draught (adedpava). Liddell and Scott give only one 
definition—a prwvy, cloaca ; and derive from &pa, seat, breech, 
Sundament. Compare English stool. The word does not refer 
to a part of the body. 


Purging all meats (ca9apifov mdvta ta Bpopara). Ac- 
cording to the A. V. these words are in apposition with draught : 
the draught which makes pure the whole of the food, since it is 
the place designed for receiving the impure excrements. 

Christ was enforcing the truth that all defilement comes from 
within. This was in the face of the Rabbinic distinctions be- 
tween clean and unclean meats. Christ asserts that Levitical 
uncleanness, such as eating with unwashed hands, is of small 
importance compared with moral uncleanness. Peter, still 
under the influence of the old ideas, cannot understand the 
saying and asks an explanation (Matt. xv. 15), which Christ 
gives in vv. 18-23. The words purging all meats (Rev., mak- 
img all meats clean) are not Christ’s, but the Evangelist’s, ex- 
plaining the bearing of Christ’s words; and therefore the Rev. 
properly renders, this he sacd (italics), making all meats clean. 
This was the interpretation of Chrysostom, who says in his 
homily on Matthew: ‘“ But Mark says that he said these things 
making all meats pure.” Canon Farrar refers to a passage 
cited from Gregory Thaumaturgus: “And the Saviour, who 
purifies all meats, says.” This rendering is significant in the 
light of Peter’s vision of the great sheet, and of the words, 
“ What God hath cleansed ” (€xaSdpice), in which Peter prob- 
ably realized for the first time the import of the Lord’s words 
on this occasion. Canon Farrar remarks: “It is doubtless 
due to the fact that St. Peter, the informant of St. Mark, 
in writing his Gospel, and as the sole ultimate authority for 
this vision in the Acts, is the source of both narratives,—that 


202 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VIL. 


we owe the hitherto unnoticed circumstance that the two verbs, 
cleanse and profane (or defile), both in a peculiarly pregnant 
sense, are the two most prominent words in the narrative of 
both events” (“ Life and Work of Paul,” i., 276-7). 


21. Evil Thoughts (d:aXoyiopoi of xaxol). Thoughts, those 
which are evil. So Rev.,in margin. Thoughts that are evil. 
The word dcadoyic po, thoughts, does not in itself convey a bad 
sense ; and hence the addition of adjectives denoting evil, as 
here and James ii. 4. Radically, it carries the idea of déscus- 
sion or debate, with an under-thought of suspicion or doubt, 
either with one’s own mind, as Luke v. 22; vi. 8; or with 
another, Luke ix. 46; Philip. ii, 14; Rom. xiv. 1. 


22. Wickedness (crovnpiar). Plural. Rev., wickednesses. 
From trovety, to tow. The adjective srovnpds means, first, op- 
pressed by tors ; then in bad case or plight, from which it runs 
into the sense of morally bad. This conception seems to have 
been associated by the high-born with the life of the lower, 
laboring, slavish class; just as our word knave (like the Ger- 
man knabe from which it is derived) originally meant simply @ 
boy or @ servant-lad. As movos means hard, vigorous labor, 
battle for instance, so the adjective zrovnpds, in a moral sense, 
indicates actwve wickedness. So Jeremy Taylor: “ Aptness to 
do shrewd turns, to delight in mischiefs and tragedies; a loving 
to trouble one’s neighbor and do him ill offices.” Iovnpés, 
therefore, is dangerous, destructive. Satan is called 6 zrovnpés, 
the wicked one. Kaxés, evil (see evil thoughts, ver. 21), character- 
izes evil rather as defect : “That which is not such as, accord- 
ing to its nature, destination, and idea it might be or ought 
to be” (Cremer). Hence of incapacity in war ; of cowardice 
(xaxia). Kaxos S0bnos, the evil servant, in Matt. xxiv. 48, is a 
servant wanting in proper fidelity and diligence. Thus the 
thoughts are styled ev7, as being that which, in their nature 
and purpose, they ought not to be. Matthew, however (xv. 19), 
calls these thoughts zrovnpot, the thoughts im action, taking 
shape in purpose. Both adjectives occur in Apoe. xvi. 2. 


Cx. VIL] MARK. 203 


Lasciviousness (dcédyeva). Derivation unknown. It in- 
cludes lasciviousness, and may well mean that here; but is 
often used without this notion. In classical Greek it is defined 
as violence, with spiteful treatment and audacity. As in this 
passage its exact meaning is not implied by its being classed 
with other kindred terms, it would seem better to take it in as 
wide a sense as possible—that of lawless imsolence and wanton 
caprice, and to render, with Trench, wantonness, since that 
word, as he remarks, “stands in remarkable ethical connec- 
tion with doédyeva, and has the same duplicity of meaning” 
(“Synonyms of the New Testament”). At Rom. xiii. 13, 
where lasciwiousness seems to be the probable meaning, from 
its association with chambering (xoirais), it is rendered wanton- 
ness in A. V. and Rev., as also at 2 Pet. ii. 18. 


Evil eye (ob3adwos ovnpds). A malicious, mischief-work- 
img eye, with the meaning of positive, injurious activity. See 
on wickednesses. 


Blasphemy (Sracdnuia). The word does not necessarily 
imply blasphemy against God. It is used of reviling, calumny, 
evil-speaking in general. See Matt. xxvii. 39; Rom. iii. 8; 
xiv. 16; 1 Pet. iv. 4, ete. Hence Rev. renders railing. 


Pride (i7repndavia). From drrép, above, and daiverSar, to 
show one’s self. The picture in the word is that of a man with 
his head held high above others. It is the sin of an uplifted 
heart against God and man. Compare Prov. xvi. 5; Rom. xii. 
16 (mind not high things); 1 Tim. iii. 6. 


24. Wentaway. Seeonch.vi.3l. The entering into the 
house and the wish to be secluded are peculiar to Mark. 


25. Daughter (Suydtpsov). Diminutive. Rev., little daugh- 
ter. See on ch. v. 23. 


26. Syro-Phoenician. Phoenician of Syria, as distinguish- 
ed from a Libyo-Phoenician of North Africa, Libya being often 
used for Africa.

97. Let the children first be filled. Peculiar to Mark. 
The dogs. Diminutive. See on Matt. xv. 26. 
28. Mark adds wnder the table. 


The children’s crumbs. See on Matt. xv. 26. This would 
indicate that the little dogs were pet dogs of the children, their 
masters. 


29, 30. Peculiar to Mark. 


Laid (BeBAnuévov). Lit., thrown. She had probably ex- 
perienced some fearful convulsion when the demon departed. 
Compare Mark ix. 22, of the demon which possessed the boy : 
“Tt hath cast him, etc. (Barev).” See also Mark i. 26; ix. 26.

35. Plain (dp9as). Lit., reghtly. So Wye. 

36. Charged (duecreivato). The verb means, first, to sep-

arated and distinguished is emphasized, to command or straitly 
charge. 

37. Astonished. See on Matt. vii. 28. 


To speak (Aadetv). See on Matt. xxviii. 18. The emphasis 
is not on the mazter, but on the fact of speech. 


Cu. VIII.) MARK. 205 


CHAPTER VIII. 


2. | have compassion (o7mAayyvifowat). A peculiar verb, 
from omAdyxva, the inward parts, especially the nobler entrails 
—the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. These came gradually 
to denote the seat of the affections, like our word heart. This 
explains the frequent use of the word dowels in the A. V. in the 
sense of tender mercy, affection, compassion. See Luke i. 78; 
2 Cor. vii. 15; Philip. i. 8; Philem. 7, 12,20. The Rev. has 
properly rejected it in every such case, using it only in its 
literal sense in the single passage, Acts i. 18. 


They have been with me (apocpévovow). Lit, they con- 
tenue, as Rev. 


3. Faint. See on Matt. xv. 32. Wyc., fadl. 
Some of them came from far. Peculiar to Mark. 
6. To sit down (davarreceiv). Lit., to recline. 
Brake and gave. See on Mark vi. 41. 


8. Were filled. Seeon Matt.v.6. Wyc., fulfilled. Tynd., 
sufficed. 


9. Baskets. See on Matt. xiv. 20. 


Four thousand. Matthew (xv. 38) here adds a detail which 
we should rather expect in Mark: beside women and children. 


10. With his disciples. Peculiar to Mark. 
11. Began. The beginnings of things seem to have a pe. 


euliar interest for Mark. Seei. 1, 45; iv. 1; v.17, 20; vi. 2, 
7, 34, 55. 


206 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.  [Cu. VIII. 


Sign (cnueiov). See on Matt. xi. 20. Wyce., token. As ap- 
plied to the miracles of our Lord, this word emphasizes their 
ethical purport, as declaring that the miraculous act points back 
of itself to the grace and power or divine character or authority 
of the doer. 


12. Sighed deeply in his spirit. Peculiar to Mark. 


There shall no sign be given (e¢ d0SHjceras onuctov). Lit., 
if a sign shall be given. The expression is elliptical. It is a 
Hebrew idiom, and is really, at bottom, a form of imprecation. 
Tf I do not thus or so, may some judgment overtake me. Com- 
pare Heb. iii. 11. 


14. The one loaf is a detail given by Mark only. 


22-26. Peculiar to Mark. 
23. Took (émtAaBopevos). Tynd., caught. 


If he saw (ei re Brérrevs). Rev., more accurately, renders the 
direct question: Seest thou aught? The change of tenses is 
graphic. Asked (imperfect). Dost thou see (present). 


24. | see men as trees walking (following the reading, 
Brérw Tors avSpwtrovs was Sévdpa Twepurrarodytas). The Rev. 
reads, following the amended text, J see men, for (6r1) L behold 
(op@) them as trees, walking. He saw them dimly. They 
looked like trees, large and misshapen ; but he knew they were 
men, for they were walking about. 


25. Made him look up. The best texts omit, and substi- 
tute duéBrewev, he looked stedfastly. See on Matt. vii.5. In- 
stead of vaguely staring, he fixed his eyes on definite objects. 


He saw (évé8rerev). Imperfect tense. Continuous action. 
He saw and continued to see. Compare the aorist tense above: 
He looked stedfastly, fastened his eyes, denoting the single act, 
the first exercise of his restored sight. 


Cx. VIII] MARK. 207 


Every man. Following the reading @avtas. But the best 
texts read dzravta, all things. So Rev. 


Clearly (rnAavyas). From rine, Sar, avyn, shining. The 
farthest things were clearly seen. 


29. He saith (émnpora). More correctly, he questioned or 
asked. So Rev. Mark omits the commendation of Peter. See 
Introduction. 


On vy. 31-83, compare notes on Matt. xvi. 21-98, 


32. He spake the saying openly. Mark only. Not as a 
secret or mystery, as in his words about being lefted up, or build- 
ing the temple in three days. Not ambiguously, but explicitly. 
Wyc., plainly. 


84. Jesus now pauses; for what he has to say now is to be 
said to all who follow him. Hence he cadls the multitude with 
his disciples. Peculiar to Mark. 


Will (9ére). Rev., would. See on Matt. i. 19. It is more 
than is wishful. 


His cross. The pronoun avrod, Ais, is in an emphatic posi- 
tion. 


35. And the gospel’s. Peculiar to Mark. 
36. Gain—lose. See on Matt. xvi. 26. 


38. My words. Bengel remarks that one may confess Christ 
in general and yet be ashamed of this or that saying. 


In this adulterous and sinful generation. Peculiar to 
Mark. 


208 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. 1X 


CHAPTER LX. 


Compare Matt. xvii. 1-13; Luke ix. 28-36. 
2. Transfigured. See on Matt. xvii. 2. 


3. Shining (cr(ABovra). Rev., glistering. The word is used 
of a gleam from polished surfaces—arms, sleek horses, water in 
motion, the twinkling of the stars, lightning. 


As no fuller, etc. Peculiar to Mark. 


5. Answered. Though no question had been asked him: 
but the Lord’s transfiguration was an appeal to him and he de- 
sired to respond. 


7. Sore afraid. Wyc., aghast by dread. 
Beloved son. Wyc., most dearworthy. 


8. Suddenly (é€amwa). The Greek word only here in the 
New Testament. 


9. Tell (Senynowvrat). Mark’s word is more graphic than 
Matthew’s elzrnre. The word is from dud, through, and 7jyéouar, 
to lead the way. Hence to lead one through a series of events: 
to narrate. 


Questioning. Wyc., asking. Tynd., disputing. 


14. The scribes. The particularizing of the scribes as the 
questioners, and vy. 15, 16, are peculiar to Mark. 


15. Were greatly amazed (é&9auRyIncav). A word pe- 
culiar to Mark. See Introduction. 


Cu. IX.] MARK. 209 


18. It taketh him (catardBn). Lit., sedzeth hold of him. Our 
word catalepsy is derived from this. 


Teareth (p70). Rev., dasheth down, with rendeth in 
margin. The verb is a form of pyyvups, to break. The form 
pnoow is used in classical Greek of dancers beating the ground, 
and of beating drums. Later, in the form pdocew, a term of 
fighters: ¢o fell, or knock down, which is the sense adopted by 
Rev. 


Gnasheth with his teeth. Rev., grindeth. This and the 
pining away are peculiar to Mark. 


19. Faithless (dscros). Faithless has acquired the sense 
of treacherous, not keeping faith. But Christ means without 
JSath, and such is Tyndale’s translation. Wyc., out of belief. 
Unbelieving would be better here. The Rev. retains this ren- 
dering of the A. V. at 1 Cor. vii. 14,15; Tit. i, 15; Apoe. 
xxi. 8, and elsewhere. 


20. Mark is more specific in his detail of the convulsion 
which seized the lad as he was coming to Jesus. He notes the 
convulsion as coming on at the demoniac’s sight of our Lord. 
“When he saw him, straightway the spirit,” etc. Also his fall- 
ing on the ground, wallowing and foaming. We might expect 
the detail of these symptoms in Luke, the physician. 


21-27. Peculiarto Mark. He gives the dialogue between 
Jesus and the boy’s father, and relates the process of the cure 
in graphic detail. 


22. Us. Very touching. The father identifies himself with 
the son’s misery. Compare the Syro-Phoenician, who makes 
her daughter’s case entirely her own: “ Have mercy on me” 
(Matt. xv. 22). 


23. If thou canst believe (70 e¢ dun). Lit., the of thou canst. 
The word believe is wanting in the best texts. It is difficult to 
explain to an English reader the force of the definite article

here. “It takes up substantially the word spoken by the father, 
and puts it with lively emphasis, without connecting it with 
the further construction, in order to link its fulfilment to the 
petitioner’s own faith” (Meyer). We might paraphrase thus. 
Jesus said: “that if thow canst of thine—as regards that, all 
things are possible,” etc. There isa play upon the words dvvn, 
canst, and Svvata, possible, which cannot be neatly rendered. 
“Tf thou canst—all things can be.” 


24. Cried out and said (xpdfas—éreyev). The former de- 
noting the inarticulate cry, the ejaculation, followed by the 
words, * Lord, I believe,” ete. 


30. Passed through (apemopevovto). Lit. passed along 
(rapé). Not tarrying. Bengel says, “not through the cities, 
but past them.” 


31. He taught (édiSacxev). ‘The Rev. would have done bet- 
ter to give the force of the imperfect here: He was teaching. 
He sought seclusion because he was engaged for the time in in- 
structing. The teaching was the continuation of the “‘ began to 
teach ” (viii. 31). 


Is delivered. The present tense is graphic. The future is 
realized by the Lord as already present. See on Matt. xxvi. 2. 


33-35. Peculiar to Mark. 


35. Servant (SudKovos). Rev., mister. Probably from 
Svdxa, to pursue ; to be the follower of a person ; to attach one’s 
self to him. As distinguished from other words in the New 
Testament meaning servant, this represents the servant in his 
activity ; while Sodd0s, slave, represents him in his condition 
or relation as a bondman. A StadKovos may be either a slave or 
a freeman. The word deacon is an almost literal transcription 
of the original. See Philip. i. 1; 1 Tim. iii. 8,12. The word 
is often used in the New Testament to denote mdnisters of the 
gospel. See 1 Cor. iii. 5; Eph. iii. 7; 1 Thess. iii. 2, and else- 
where. Mark uses SodA0s in x. 44.

When he had taken him in his arms (évayxaducdpevos). 
The verb is found only in Mark, and only he records this detail. 


37. In my name. Lit., “upon (él) my name.” See on 
Matt. xviii. 5. 


38. In thy name. John’s conscience is awakened by the 
Lord’s words. They had not received the man who cast out 
devils in Christ’s name. 


42. Millstone. Rev., great millstone. See on Matt. xviii. 
6. Wyc., millstone of asses. Note the graphic present and 
perfect tenses ; the millstone 7s hanged, and he hath been cast. 


43. Hell. See on Matt. v. 22. 


47. With one eye (uovodIarpov). Lit., one-eyed. One of 
Mark’s words which is branded as slang. Wye. oddly renders 
goggle-eyed. 


50. Have lost its saltness (dvanov yévntat). Lit., may have 
become saltless. Compare on Matt. v. 13. 


Will ye season (aprucere), Lit., will ye restore. Compare 
Col. iv. 5.

written accusation. Accordingly Wye. has a libel of forsaking, 
and Tynd. a testemonial of her. dworcement. 


7. Shall cleave. See on Matt. xix. 5. Tynd., bide by. 


912 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. X. 


8. Shall be one flesh (gcovras els cdpxa piav). Lit., “shall 
be unto one flesh.” The preposition expresses more graphically 
than the A. V. the becoming of one from two. So Rev., shal 
become. 


9. What. Regarding the two as one. 


13. They brought (mpocédepov). Imperfect tense; they 
were bringing, as he went on his way. Similarly, were rebuk- 
ing, as they were successively brought. 


16. Took them in his arms. See on ix. 36. 


Put his hands upon them and blessed them. The best 
texts read xatevddyet, TWels Tas yelpas er avtd, blessed them, 
laying his hands upon them ; including the laying on of hands 
in the blessing. The compound rendered blessed occurs only 
here in the New Testament. It is stronger than the simple 
form, and expresses the earnestness of Christ’s interest. Alford 
renders fervently blessed. 


17. Running and kneeled. Two details peculiar to Mark. 


18. Why callest thou, etc. Compare Matt. xix. 17. The 
renderings of the A. V. and Rev. here are correct. There is no 
change of reading as in Matthew, where the text was altered 
to conform it to Mark and Luke. 


22. He was sad (otvyvdacas). Applied to the sky in Matt. 
xvi. 3; lowering. The word paints forcibly the gloom which 
clouded his face. 


25. Needle (padidos). A word stigmatized by the gram- 
marians as unclassical. One of them (Phrynichus) says, “ As 
for padis, nobody would know what it is.” Matthew also uses 
it. See on Matt. xix. 24. Luke uses Bedovns, the surgical 
needle. See on Luke xviii. 25. 


30. Houses, etc. These details are peculiar to Mark. Note 
especially with persecutvons, and see Introduction. With beau-

ciples is noted by Mark only. 


42. Which are accounted to rule. Wyc., that seem to 
have princehead on folks. 


43. Minister. See on ix. 35. 


45. For many (avti mwoddav). For, in the sense of over 
against, instead of ; not on behalf of. 


46. Son of Timaeus. Mark, as usual, is particular about 
names. 


Blind. Diseases of the eye are very common in the East. 
Thomson says of Ramleh, “The ash-heaps are extremely mis- 
chievous; on the occurrence of the slightest wind the air is 
filled with a fine, pungent dust, which is very injurious to the 
eyes. I once walked the streets counting all that were either 
blind or had defective eyes, and it amounted to about one-half 
the male population. The women I could not count, for they 
are rigidly veiled” (“Land and Book”). Palgrave says that 
ophthalmia is fearfully prevalent, especially among children. 
“Tt would be no exaggeration to say that one adult out of 
every five has his eyes more or less damaged by the conse- 
quences of this disease” (“Central and Eastern Arabia”). 


Beggar. See on Matt. v. 3. 


49,50. Peculiar to Mark, and adding greatly to the vividness 
of the narrative.

up, or, as Rev., sprang up.

2. Colt. Only Matthew addsthe ass. Mark and Luke have 
colt only. 


4. In a place where two ways met (éml tod dpudddov). 
*Audobor is literally any road which leads round (apt) a place 
or a block of buildings. Hence the winding way. The word 
occurs only here in the New Testament. Rev., in the open street, 
which in an Eastern town is usually crooked. Perhaps, by con- 
trast with the usual crookedness, the street in Damascus where 
Paul lodged was called Strazght (Acts ix. 11). “It is a topo- 
graphical note,” says Dr. Morison, “that could only be given by 
an eye-witness.” The detail of ver. 4 is peculiar to Mark. Ac- 
cording to Luke (xxii. 8), Peter was one of those sent, and his 
stamp is probably on the narrative. 


8. Inthe way. Both Matthew and Luke have éy, in; but 
Mark, eis, into. They threw their garments znto the way and 
spread them there. 


Branches. Matthew, Mark, and John use each a different 
word for branches. Matt., «dddous, from krde, to break ; hence 
a young slop or shoot, such as is broken off for grafting—a twig, 
as related to a branch. Mark, otiBddas, from oreiBa, to tread 
or beat down ; hence a mass of straw, rushes, or leaves beaten 
together or strewed loose, so as to form a bed or a carpeted way. 
A litter of branches and leaves cut from the fields (only Mark) 
near by. John, Baia, strictly palm-branches, the feathery 
fronds forming the tufted crown of the tree. 


Hosanna. Meaning, O save/

the master of the house, inspecting. ‘A look serious, sorrow: 
ful, judicial ” (Meyer). Compare iii. 5, 34.

Having leaves. An unusual thing at that early season. 


If haply (e¢ dpa). If, such being the case, i.e., the tree having 
leaves—he might find fruit, which, in the fig, precedes the leaf. 
Mark alone adds, “for the time of figs was not yet.” 


14. His disciples heard it. Peculiar to Mark. 


15. Money-changers (xoddvGiorov). Another unclassical 
word, but used also by Matthew. ‘Such words as these might 
naturally find their place in the mongrel Greek of the slaves 
and freedmen who formed the first congregations of the church 
in Rome” (Ezra Abbott, Art. “ Gospels,” in Encyc. Britannica). 
See on Matt. xxi. 12. 


16. Vessel (cxevdos). See on Matt. xii. 29; Mark iii. 27. 


Temple (iepod). See on Matt. iv. 5. The temple enclosure, 
not the vads, or sanctuary. People would be tempted to carry 
vessels, etc., through this, in order to save a long circuit. The 
court of the Gentiles, moreover, was not regarded by the Jews as 
entitled to the respect due to the other part of the enclosure. 
This our Lord rebukes. 


17. Of all nations. Which rendering implies, shall be called 
by all nations. But render with Rev., a house of prayer for 
all the nations (racw Tots éSverw). 


Thieves (Ayordv). Rev., correctly, robbers. See on Matt. 
xxi. 18; xxvi. 55; John x. 1, 8. From Anis or Acta, booty. In 
classical usage mostly of cattle. The robber, conducting his 
operations on a large and systematic scale, and with the aid of 
bands, is thus to be distinguished from the «démrtns, or thief 
who purloins or pilfers whatever comes to hand. <A den would 
be appropriate to a band of robbers, not to thieves. Thus the 
traveller to Jericho, in Christ’s parable (Luke x. 30), fell among 
robbers, not thieves.

CHAPTER XI,

1. Wine-fat (d7roAj0v). Rev., wine-press. Only here in 
New Testament. The wine-press was constructed in the side 
of a sloping rock, in which a trough was excavated, which was 
_ the wine-press proper. Underneath this was dug another 
trough, with openings communicating with the trough above, 
into which the juice ran from the press. This was called by 
the Romans lacus, or the lake. ‘The word here used for the 
whole structure strictly means this trough wnderneath (i716) the 
press (Anvos). This is the explanation of Wyce.’s translation, 
dalf (delved), a lake. 


Went into a far country (dredjuncev). But this is too 
strong. The word means simply went abroad. So Wyc., went 
forth in pilgrimage ; and Tynd., into a strange country. Rev., 
another country. See on Matt. xxv. 14.

Luke iv. 21; John xix. 37; Acts i. 16. 

11. The Lord’s doing (apa xupiov). Lit., from the Lord. 

13-17. Compare Matt. xxii. 15-22. 

13. Catch (aypevcwow). From dypa, hunting, the chase. 
Hence the picture in the word is that of hunteng, while that in 


Matthew’s word, mayievowowr, is that of catching in a trap. 
See on Matt. xxii. 15.

17. They marvelled (éfeIavpafov). The preposition ¢€, 
out of, indicates great astonishment. They marvelled owt of 
measure. Hence Rev., marvelled greatly. The A. V. follows 
another reading, with the simple verb é9avpafov. The imper- 
fect denotes continuance. they stood wondering.

Asked (éznpotev). Stronger. They questioned. 


24. Therefore (Sea robro). A rendering which obscures the 
meaning. The words point forward to the next two clauses. 
The reason of your error is your <gnorance of the scriptures and 
of the power of God. Hence Rev., correctly, Ls 2é not for thes 
cause that ye err ? 


Err (wAavacde). Lit., wander out of the way. Compare 
Latin errare. Of the wandering sheep, Matt. xviii. 12; 1 Pet. 
ii. 25. Of the martyrs wandering in the deserts, Heb. xi. 38. 
Often rendered in the New Testament decewe. See Mark xiii. 
5,6. Compare dorépes mravatar, wandering stars (Jude 13), 
from which our word planet. 


26. How in the bush God spake. An utterly wrong ren- 
dering. In the bush (émi tod Barov), refers to a particular sec- 
tion in the Pentateuch, Exod. iii. 2-6. The Jews were accus- 
tomed to designate portions of scripture by the most noteworthy 
thing contained in them. Therefore Rev., rightly, in the place 
concerning the bush. Wyc., im the book of Moses on the bush. 
The article refers to it as something familiar. Compare Rom. 
xi. 2, év Hla; ie., in the section of scripture which tells of 
Elijah. There, however, the Rev. retains the A. V. of Hizjah, 
and puts am in the margin.

28. Well («aras). Lit., beautifully, finely, admirably. 
What (7rota). Rather, of what nature.

moral, spiritual, and intellectual. 


Soul (vyijs). The word is often used in the New Testa- 
ment in its original meaning of life. See Matt. 11.20; xx. 28; 
Acts xx. 10; Rom. xi. 3; John x. 11. Hence, as an emphatic 
designation of the man himself. See Matt. xii. 18; Heb. x. 38; 
Luke xxi. 19. So that the word denotes “life in the distinct- 
ness of individual existence” (Cremer). See farther on Wuyexos, 
spiritual, 1 Cor. xv. 44. 


Mind (8cavoias). The faculty of thought: understanding, 
especially the mora/ understanding.

Well (cadas). Exclamatory, as one says good / on hearing 
something which he approves. 


The truth (é7 ddn3elas). Incorrect. The phrase is ad- 
verbial; of a truth, in truth, truthfully, and qualifies the suc- 
ceeding verb, thow hast sacd. 


For (671). The A. V. begins a new and explanatory sentence 
with this word; but it is better with Rev. to translate that, and 
make the whole sentence continuous: Zhou hast truthfully sard 
that he 7s one. 


33. Understanding (cvvécews). A different word from that 
in ver. 30. From ocuvinus, to send or bring together. Hence 
cuveows is a union or bringing together of the mind with an 
object, and so used to denote the faculty of quick comprehen- 
sion, intelligence, sagacity. Compare on ouverdv, the pru- 
dent, Matt. xi. 25. 


220 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XII, 


34. Discreetly (vovveyas). From vods, mind, and éyw, to 
have. Having his mind in possession: “having his wits about 
him.” The word occurs only here in the New Testament. 


37. The common people (0 zrodvs dyAos). Not indicating 
a social distinction, but the great mass of the people: the crowd 
at large. 


38. Desire (9é\ovrwv). See on Matt. i. 19. 


39. Uppermost rooms (zpwtoxdtcias). More correctly, the 
chief couches. So Rev., chief places. 


40. Widows’ houses. People often left their whole for- 
tune to the temple, and a good deal of the temple-money 
went, in the end, to the Scribes and Pharisees. The Scribes 
were universally employed in making wills and conveyances of 
property. They may have abused their influence with widows. 


41. The treasury. In the Court of the Women, which 
covered a space of two hundred feet square. All round it ran 
a colonnade, and within it, against the wall, were the thirteen 
chests or “trumpets” for charitable contributions. These chests 
were narrow at the mouth and wide at the bottom, shaped like 
trumpets, whence their name. Their specific objects were care- 
fully marked on them. Nine were for the receipt of what was 
legally due by worshippers, the other four for strictly voluntary 
gifts. See Edersheim, ‘The Temple.” 


Beheld (éSewper). Observed thoughtfully. 
Cast. Note the graphic present tense: are casting. 


Money (yaAxdv). Lit., copper, which most of the people 
gave. 


Cast in (€8addov). Imperfect tense: were casting in as he 
looked. 


cu. XIII] MARK. 221 


Much (7oaAd). Lit., many things ; possibly many pieces of 
current copper coin, 


42. A certain (uéa). Not a good translation. Lit., one as 
distinguished from the many rich. Better, simply the indefi- 
nite article, as Rev. 


Poor (rrwx7). See on Matt. v. 3. 


Mites (Aerra). From derrés, peeled, husked ; and thence 
thin or fine. Therefore of a very small or thin coin. 


Farthing (xoSpdvrns). A Latin word, guadrans, or a quarter 
of a Roman as, quadrans meaning a fourth, as farthing is 


fourthing. 


43. This poor widow (7 yijpa airy  wrwy7). The Greek 
order is very suggestive, forming a kind of climax: this widow, 
the poor one, or and she poor. 


CHAPTER XIII. 


1. Stones. The spring-stones of the arches of the bridge 
which spanned the valley of Tyropoeon (the cheese-makers), and 
connected the ancient city of David with the royal porch of the 
temple, measured twenty-four feet in length by six in thick- 
ness. Yet these were by no means the largest in the masonry 
of the temple. Both at the southeastern and southwestern 
angles stones have been found measuring from twenty to forty 
feet long, and weighing above one hundred tons (Edersheim, 
“ Temple”). 


3. Thrown down (xatadv97). Rather, loosened down. A 
very graphic word, implying gradual demolition. 


3. Note the particularity of detail in Mark. He adds, over 
against the temple, and the names of the four who asked the 
question. With the following discourse compare Matt. Xxiv. 


222 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XIIL 


6. In my name (é/). Lit., wpon. Basing their claims on 
the use of my name. 


7. Rumors of wars. Wyc., opinions of battles. Such as 
would be a cause of terror to the Hebrew Christians; as the 
three threats of war against the Jews by Caligula, Claudius, 
and Nero. There were serious disturbances at Alexandria, 
A.D. 38, in which the Jews were the especial objects of persecu- 
tion ; at Seleucia about the same time, in which more than fifty 
thousand Jews were killed ; and at Jamnia, near Joppa. 


Troubled (Spocic3e). Opoéw is, literally, to cry aloud. 


Earthquakes. Between the prophecy and the destruction 
of Jerusalem (a.p. 70) occurred: A great earthquake in Crete, 
A.D. 46 or 47: at Rome, on the day on which Nero entered his 
majority, a.D. 51: at Apameia, in Phrygia, a.p. 53; “on ac- 
count of which,” says Tacitus, “ they were exempted from 
tribute for five years:” at Laodicea, in Phrygia, a.p. 60: in 
Campania, a.p. 63, by which, according to Tacitus, the city of 
Pompeii was largely destroyed. 


Famines. During the reign of Claudius, a.v. 41-54, four 
famines are recorded: One at Rome, a.p. 41, 42; one in J udaea, 
A.D. 44; one in Greece, A.D. 50 ; and again at Rome, a.p. 52, when 
the people rose in rebellion and threatened the life of the em- 
peror. Tacitus says that it was accompanied by frequent earth- 
quakes, which levelled houses. The famine in Judaea was prob- 
ably the one prophesied by Agabus, Acts xi. 28. Of the year 
65 a.p., Tacitus says: “ This year, disgraced by so many deeds 
of horror, was further distinguished by the gods with storms 
and sicknesses. Campania was devastated by a hurricane which 
overthrew buildings, trees, and the fruits of the soil in every 
direction, even to the gates of the city, within which a pestilence 
thinned all ranks of the population, with no atmospheric disturb- 
ance that the eye could trace. The houses were choked with 
dead, the roads with funerals: neither sex nor age escaped. 
Slaves and freemen perished equally amid the wailings of 


Cx. XII] MARK. 2203) 


their wives and children, who were often hurried to the pyre 
by which they had sat in tears, and consumed together with 
them. The deaths of knights and senators, promiscuous as they 
were, deserved the less to be lamented, inasmuch as, falling by 
the common lot of mortality, they seemed to anticipate the 
prince’s cruelty ” (“ Annals,” xvi., 10-18). 


9. Sorrows (@divwv). Reyv., rightly, travadl ; for the word 
is used especially of birth-throes. 


Shall ye be beaten (8aprjcecIe). The verb literally means 
to skin or flay, and by a slang usage, like our phrase to tan or 
hide, comes to mean to cudgel or beat. 


11. They lead (aywouv). Present subjunctive; better per- 
haps, may be leading. While you are going along in custody to 
the judgment-seat, do not be worrying about your defences. 


Take no thought beforehand (7) wpowepimvare). See on 
Matt. vi. 25. 


14. Abomination. See on Matt. xxiv. 15. 
15. Housetop. See on Matt. xxiv. 17. 


19. The creation which God created. Note the peculiar 
amplification, and compare ver. 20, the elect or chosen whom he 
chose. 


90. Shortened. See on Matt. xxiv. 22. 


22. Shall shew (Secovaw). Lit., shall give. A few editors, 
however, read trownoovow, shall make or do. 


24, Light (déyyos). The word is used in the New Testament 
wherever the light of the moon is referred to. Compare Matt. 
xxiv. 29, the only other instance. It occurs also in Luke xi. 38, 
but meaning the light of a lamp. 


924 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cx. XIII. 


25. The stars of heaven shall fall. A rendering which 
falls very far short of the graphic original: of aorépes écovras 
€x Tov ovpavov Timtovtes : the stars shall be falling from heaven. 
So Reyv., thus giving the sense of continuousness, as of a shower 
of falling stars. 


27. From the uttermost part of the earth to the utter- 
most part of heaven (a7 dxpov yijs ws dxpou ovpavov). From 
the outermost border of the earth, conceived as a flat surface, to 
where the outermost border of the heaven sets a limit to the 
earth. Compare Matt. xxiv. 31. Mark’s expression is more 
poetical. 


28. Parable. See on Matt. xxiv. 32. 
Branch. Seeon Mark xi. 8. 


29. Come to pass (ywvdueva). The present participle, and 
therefore better as Rev., coming to pass ; in process of fulfil- 
metn. 


33. Watch (aypumveire). The word is derived from dypevo, 
to hunt, and imvos, sleep. The picture is of one in pursuit of 
sleep, and therefore wakeful, restless. Wye.’s rendering of the 
whole passage is striking: See / wake ye and pray ye! 


34. A man taking a far journey (dvIparos amdé8nuos). The 
A. V. is incorrect, since the idea is not that of a man about to 
go, a8 Matt. xxv. 14; but of one already gone. So Wye., gone 
far in pilgrimage ; and Tynd., which is gone into a strange 
country. The two words form one notion—a man abroad. Rev., 
sojourning in another country. 


35. Watch (ypnyopetre). A different word from that in ver. 
33. See also ver. 34. The picture in this word is that of a 
sleeping man rousing himself. While the other word conveys 
the idea of simple wakefulness, this adds the idea of alertness. 
Compare Matt. xiv. 88; Luke xii. 37; 1 Pet. v.8. The apos- 


Ou. XV] MARK. 295 


tles are thus compared with the doorkeepers, ver. 34; and the 
night season isin keeping with the figure. In the temple, dur- 
ing the night, the captain of the temple made his rounds, and 
the guards had to rise at his approach and salute him in a par- 
ticular manner. Any guard found asleep on duty was beaten, 
or his garments were set on fire. Compare Apoc. xvi. 15: 
“ Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments.” The 
preparations for the morning service required all to be early 
astir. The superintending priest might knock at the door at 
any moment. The Rabbis use almost the very words in which 
scripture describes the unexpected coming of the Master. 
“Sometimes he came at the cockcrowing, sometimes a little 
earlier, sometimes a little later. He came and knocked and 
they opened to him ” (Edersheim, “ The Temple”). 


37. Watch. The closing and summary word is the stronger 
word of ver. 35: Be awake and on guard. 


CHAPTER XIV. 
1. The feast of the passover and the unleavened bread 


(70 racya kal ta Alva). Lit., the passover and the unleawened. 
It was really one and the same festival. 


Sought (é&jrovv). Imperfect tense: were all this while seek- 
mg. 


3-9. Compare Matt. xxvi. 6-13. 
3. Alabaster box. See on Matt. xxvi. 7. 


Spikenard (vapdov muatixjs). The meaning of mvotuxijs is 
greatly disputed. The best authorities define it genwine or 
unadulterated : pure nard. 


Brake. Possibly by striking the brittle neck of the flask. 
This detail is peculiar to Mark.

Lit., she anticipated to anoint. Rev., hath anointed beforehand. 
The verb puvpifw is found only here. 


11. Money. See on Matt. xxvi. 15. 


He sought (éfjrev). Imperfect tense. He kept seeking: 
busied himself continuously from that time. 


Conveniently (evxaipws). Might find a good opportunity 
(«aspos). 


13. Aman. A slave probably, whose business it was to 
draw water. See Deut. xix. 11. 


Pitcher. Of earthenware: xepdusov, from Képapos, potter’s 
clay. 


14. My guest-chamber (xardAvyd pov). Luke xxii. 11. 
The word is not classical, and as used by an oriental signifies 
a khan or carawansera. Hence mn at Luke ii. 7. My cham- 
ber. It was a common practice that more than one company 
partook of the paschal supper in the same apartment; but 
Christ will have his chamber for himself and his disciples alone. 


15. And he (ards). The Greek is more emphatic. “He 
will Aemself show you.” So Rev. Probably the owner of the 
house was a disciple.

Furnished (éorpwpévov). Lit., strewed with carpets, and

portion of one part to two of water. 

24. Covenant. See on Matt. xxvi. 28. 

Is shed (76 éxyuvvdpevov). Lit., is being shed. This present 
participle is significant. To the Lord’s mind the sacrifice is 
already being offered.

26. Sung an hymn. See on Matt. xxvi. 30. 

28. Go before. See on Matt. xxvi. 32. 


30. Cock crow. See on Matt. xxvi. 34. Mark alone adds

Deny (arapvjcn). The compound verb signifies utterly deny. 


31. | will not deny (0d pj ce amapvyjcouat). The double 
negative with the future forms the strongest possible assertion. 


32. Gethsemane. See on Matt. xxvi. 36. 


33. To be sore amazed (éxIauBetoIar). A word peculiar 
to Mark. Compare ix. 15; xvi. 5, 6.

40. Heavy (xataBapuvopevor). Lit., weighed down: very

41. It is enough (d7réye). Peculiar to Mark. In this im- 
personal sense the word occurs nowhere else in the New Testa- 
ment. Expositors are utterly at sea as to its meaning. 


43. One of the twelve. See on Matt. xxvi. 47; as also on 
multitude. 


44. Token (cvconuov). A later Greek compound used only 
by Mark in this passage. Compare onpetov, Matt. xxvi. 48. 
The ovv, with, gives the force of a mutual token: a concerted 
signal. 


45. Kissed. See on Matt. xxvi. 49. 
47. The servant. See on Matt. xxvi. 51. 


Ear (@rdpiov). A word found only here and at John xviii.

48. A thief. Rev., better, robber. See on Matt. xxvi. 55, 
and Mark xi. 17. 


51,52. The incident is related by Mark only. There is no 
means of knowing who the youth may have been. Conjecture 
has named Mark himself, John, James the Just, Lazarus, the 
brother of Martha and Mary, and St. Paul! 


51. Linen cloth (ctvddva). The probable derivation is from 
*Ivéds, an Indian: India being the source from which came 
this fine fabric used for wrapping dead bodies, and in which 
Christ’s body was enveloped. See Matt. xxvii. 59; Mark xv. 
46; Luke xxiii. 53. 


54. Palace (avAmv). Rather, court, as Rev., the quadrangle 
round which the chambers were built. See on Matt. xxvi. 3.

denoting continuousness. What occurred after occurred while 
he was sitting. So Rev.

Servants. Rev., officers. See on Matt. v. 25. 


At the fire (pos 76 gas). Pas is never used of the fire it- 
self, but of the laght of the fire; and this is the point to which 
the evangelist directs attention: that the firelight, shining on 
Peter’s face, called forth the challenge of the maid (ver. 66). 


56. Their witness agreed not. Peculiar to Mark. Lit., 
their testimonies were not equal. Hence the difficulty of fulfill- 
ing the requirement of the law, which demanded ¢wo witnesses. 
See Deut. xvii. 6; and compare Matt. xviii. 16; 1 Tim. y. 19; 
Heb. x. 28.

without hands, and the following sentence. 


62. lam. See on Matt. xxvi. 64. 


64. Guilty of death. See on Matt. xxvi. 66. 
65. Buffet. See on Matt. xxvi. 67. 


Palms of their hands (faricuacw). An unclassical word, 
but used also by John (xix. 3). The word means dlows. 


Did strike. Following the old reading, é8adrov. The cor-

7. Them that had made insurrection with him (cvoracr- 
actav). FHellow-rioters. But the better texts read otaovac- 
Tay, rioters, omitting the ovv, with (fellow): and the Rev. ac- 
cordingly omits weth him. 


Who (ofruves). Denoting a class of criminals. 
oD 


The insurrection. Note the article: the insurrection for 
which Barabbas and his fellows had been imprisoned. 


8. Crying aloud (dvaBojcas). But the best texts read ava- 
Bas, hawing gone up. So Rev., went up. 


Ever (del). Omitted by the best texts. 


11. Moved (dvécevoav). A feeble translation. Selw is to 
shake. UWence cevcpuos, an earthquake. See on Matt. xiii. 8. 
Better as Rev., stirred up. Wryc.,The bishops stirred the com- 
pony of people. 


15. To content (76 txavov moujoat). Lit., to do the sufficient 
thing. Compare the popular phrase, Do the right thing. A 
Latinism, and used by Mark only. Wye., to do enough to the 
people. 


16. Into the hall called Pretorium. Mark, as usual, ampli- 
fies. Matthew has simply the Pretoriwm. The courtyard, sur- 


Cu. XV] MARK. 931 


rounded by the buildings of the Pretorium, so that the people 
passing through the vestibule into this quadrangle found them- 
selves in the Pretorium. 


Band (o7eipav). Originally anything wound or wrapped 
round ; asa ball, the coils of a snake, a knot or curl in wood. 
Hence a body of men-at-arms. The same idea is at the bottom 
of the Latin manipulus, which is sometimes (as by Josephus) 
used to translate omeipa. Manipulus was originally a bundle 
or handful. The ancient Romans adopted a pole with a hand- 
ful of hay or straw twisted about it as the standard of a com- 
pany of soldiers; hence a certain number or body of soldiers 
under one standard was called manipulus. 


17. Purple. See on Matt. xxvii. 28. Matthew adds the word 
for soldier’s cloak. Mark has simply purple. 


21. Compel. Better impress, as Rev. in margin. See on 
Matt. v. 41. Note the accuracy in designating Simon.

23. They gave (éd/Souv). The imperfect tense is used in the 
same sense as in Matt. iii. 14 (Rev.), “John would have hin- 
dered.” They were for giving ; attempted to give. So Rev., 
excellently, offered. 


Wine mingled with myrrh (écpupricpévoy oivov).  Lit.,

known. 


Honorable (evoyruwv). Compounded of eb, well, and oxfua, 
form, shape, figure. On the latter word, see on Matt. xvii. 2. 
In its earlier use this adjective would, therefore, emphasize the 
dignified external appearance and deportment. So Plato, noble 
bearing (“ Republic,” 413). Later, it came to be used in the 
sense of noble ; honorable in rank. See Acts xiii. 50; xvii. 12.

used only of a dead body. See on Matt. xxiv. 28.

correctly, as Rev., when the sun was risen.

amazed. It was wonder rather than fright.

Astonishment (éxaraots). See on Mark vy. 42. 

Afraid (époB8otvro). The wonder merges into fear. 

By a large number of the ablest modern critics the remainder 


of this chapter is held to be from some other hand than Mark’s. 
It is omitted from the two oldest manuscripts. 


234 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XVI. 


9. The first day of the week (mpotn ca8Bdrov). A 
phrase which Mark does not use. In ver. 2 of this chapter it 
is pds caBPBaTov. 


Out of whom he had cast seven devils. With Mark’s 
well-known habit of particularizing, it is somewhat singular 
that this circumstance was not mentioned in either of the three 
previous allusions to Mary (xv. 40, 47; xvi. 1). 


Out of whom (aq@’ 7s). An unusual expression. Mark 
habitually uses the preposition é« in this connection (i. 25, 26; 
v. 8; vii. 26, 29; ix. 25). Moreover, az, from, is used with 
éxBarxrewv, cast out, nowhere else in the New Testament. The 
peculiarity is equally marked if we read with some, zap’ js. 


10. She (éxeivn). An absolute use of the pronoun unex- 
ampled in Mark. See also vv. 11,13. It would imply an em- 
phasis which is not intended. Compare iv. 11; xii. 4, 5, 7; 
xivs 21: 


Went (zopevdeica). Soin vv. 12,15. Went, go. This verb 
for to go occurs nowhere else in this Gospel except in com- 
pounds. 


Them that had been with him (rots per’ adréu yevopévors). 
A circumlocution foreign to the Gospels. 


12. After these things (werd radra). An expression never 
used by Mark. 


Another form (érépa poppy). More correctly, a different 
form. 


14. Afterward (dcrepov). Not found elsewhere in Mark. 
Often in Matthew. 


15. To every creature (don 7h xtice). Rightly, as Rev., 
to the whole creation. 


Cu. XVI] MARK. 235 


16. Shall be damned (xataxpuSjcerac). A most unfortu- 
nate rendering. The word is a judicial term, and, as Dr. Mo- 
rison truthfully says, “determines, by itself, nothing at all 
concerning the nature, degree, or extent of the penalty to be 
endured.” See on the kindred noun, «pia, judgment, rendered 
by A. V. damnation, 1 Cor. xi. 29. Rev., rightly, condemned. 


17. Shall follow (wapaxorovIjoer). The preposition mapd, 
alongside of, gives the sense of accompany. 


18. The sick (dppéarovs). See on Mark vi. 5. 


20. Following (éraxorov9ovvtwv). Following closely: force 
of ért. Both this and the word for follow, in ver. 17, are 
foreign to Mark’s diction, though he frequently uses the sim- 
ple verb. 

A manuscript of the eighth or ninth century, known as L, 
has, at the close of ver. 8, these words: ‘In some instances 
there is added as follows.” Then we read: “ But all the things 
enjoined they announced without delay to those who were 
around Peter (z.e., to Peter and those who were with him). 
And afterward Jesus himself, from the east unto the west, 
sent forth throngh them the sacred and incorruptible message

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE. 


INTRODUCTION TO THE WRITINGS OF LUKE. 


Lzcenp has been busy with the name of Luke. The Greek 
Church, in which painting is regarded as a religious art, readily 
accepted the tradition which represented him as a painter, and 
the Greek painters carried it into Western Europe. A rude 
drawing of the Virgin, discovered in the Catacombs, with an 
inscription to the effect that it was one of seven painted by 
Inca, confirmed the popular belief that Luke the Evangelist 
was meant. According to the legend, he carried with him two 
portraits painted by himself—the one of the Saviour and the 
other of the Virgin—and by means of these he converted many 
of the heathen. 

When we apply to historical] sources, however, we find very 
little about this evangelist. He never mentions himself by 
name in the Gospel or in the Acts, and his name occurs in only 
three passages of the New Testament: Col. iv. 14; 2 Tim. iv. 
11; Philem. 24. 

That he was an Asiatic-Greek convert of Antioch, though rest- 
ing upon no conclusive evidence, is supported by the fact that he 
gives much information about the church there (Acts xi. 19, 
30; xiii. 1-3; xv. 1-3, 22, 35); that he traces the origin of the 
name “Christian” to that city, and that, in enumerating the 
seven deacons of Jerusalem, he informs us of the Antiochian 
origin of Nicholas (Acts vi. 5) without reference to the nation- 
ality of any of the others. That he was a physician and the 
companion of Paul are facts attested by Scripture, though his 
connection with Paul does not definitely appear before Acts xvi. 


940 INTRODUCTION TO LUKE. 


10, where he uses the first person plural. He accompanied 
Paul from Caesarea, through the shipwreck at Malta, to Rome, 
and remained there until his liberation. Tradition makes him 
to have died in Greece, and it was believed that his remains 
were transferred to Constantinople. 

It has been assumed that he was a freedman, from the large 
number of physicians who belonged to that class, the Greeks 
and Romans being accustomed to educate some of their domes- 
tics in the science of medicine, and to grant them freedom in 
requital of services. Physicians often held no higher rank than 
slaves, and it has been noticed that contractions in as, like 
Lucas for Lucanus, were peculiarly common in the names of 
slaves. 

His connection with Paul gave rise in the church, at a very 
early period, to the opinion that he wrote his Gospel under 
the superintendence of that apostle. While his preface says 
nothing about the Pauline sanction of his Gospel, the work, 
nevertheless, presents remarkable coincidences with Paul’s 
epistles, both in language, ideas, and spirit. The Gospel itself 
sets forth that conception of Christ’s life and work which was 
the basis of Paul’s teaching. He represents the views of Paul, 
as Mark does of Peter. ‘There isa striking resemblance be- 
tween the style of Luke and of Paul, which corresponds to their 
spiritual sympathy and long intimacy.” Some two hundred 
expressions or phrases may be found which are common to 
Luke and Paul, and more or less foreign to other New Testa- 
ment writers. Such, for instance, are:

Luke’s long residence in Greece makes it probable that he had 
Greek readers especially in mind. The same humanitarian and 
Gentile character of his writings, as distinguished from Jew- 
ish writings, appears in the Acts as in the Gospel. Of the 
Acts, although attempts have been made to assign its composi- 
tion to Timothy and to Silas, and to identify Silas with Luke, 
the universal testimony of the ancient church, no less than the 
identity of style, declare Luke to be the author. About fifty 
words not found elsewhere in the New Testament are common 
to both books. 

From a purely literary point of view Luke’s Gospel has been 
pronounced, even by Renan, to be the most beautiful book ever 
written. He says: “The Gospel of Luke is the most literary of 
the gospels. Everywhere there is revealed a spirit large and 
sweet ; wise, temperate, sober, and reasonable in the irrational. 
Its exaggerations, its inconsistencies, its improbabilities, are 
true to the very nature of parable, and constitute its charm. 
Matthew rounds a little the rough outlines of Mark. Luke 
does better: he writes. He displays a genuine skill in compo- 
sition. His book is a beautiful narrative, well contrived, at once 
Hebraic and Hellenic, uniting the emotion of the drama with 
the serenity of the idyl . . . Avspirit of holy infancy, of 
joy, of fervor, the gospel feeling in its primitive freshness, dif- 
fuse all over the legend an incomparably sweet coloring.” 

Luke is the best writer of Greek among the evangelists. His 
construction is rhythmical, his vocabulary rich and well selected, 
considerably exceeding that of the other evangelists. He uses 
over seven hundred words which occur nowhere else in the New 
Testament. He substitutes classical words for many which are 
used by Matthew and Mark, as Aiuyn, lake, for draco, SEA, 


INTRODUCTION TO LUKE. 943 


when describing the lake of Galilee. He uses three distinct 
words for bed in the description of the healing of the paralytic 
(vv. 18-25), avoiding the vulgar xpad@Batos of Mark. The lat- 
ter word, it is true, occurs in two passages in the Acts (v. 15; 
ix. 33), but both these passages are Petrine. So, too, we find 
émictatns, master, instead of Rabbi; vopuxol, lawyers, for 
ypappareis, scribes ; val, ddAnIas, ér adndelas, yea, truly, of a 
truth, for apn, verily ; opos, tribute, for the Latin form, 
Khvaos, census. He uses several Latin words, as dyvdpcov, de- 
narius ; deyeav, legion ; covddpiov, napkin; aocdpwov, far- 
thing, though he avoids xodpavtns, farthing, in xxi. 2 (compare 
Mark xii. 42); pddvos, bushel. He is less Hebraic than the 
other evangelists, except in the first two chapters—the history 
of the infaney—which he derived probably from Aramaic tra- 
ditions or documents, and where his language has a stronger 
Hebrew coloring than any other portion of the New Testament. 
“The songs of Zacharias, Elizabeth, Mary, and Simeon, and the 
anthem of the angelic host, are the last of Hebrew psalms, as 
well as the first of Christian hymns. They can be literally trans- 
lated back into the Hebrew without losing their beauty” (Schaff). 

His style is clear, animated, picturesque, and unpretentious. 
Where he describes events on the authority of others, his man- 
ner is purely historical; events which have come under his own 
observation he treats in the minute and circumstantial style of 
an eye-witness. Compare, for instance, the detailed narrative 
of the events at Philippi with that of the occurrences at Thessa- 
lonica. The change of style at Acts xvi. 10, from the histori- 
cal to the personal narrative, coincides with the time of his join- 
ing Paul at the first visit to Macedonia, and a similar change 
may be noted at Acts xx. 4-6. 

But the style of Luke also acquires a peculiar flavor from his 
profession. His language, both in the Gospel and in the Acts, 
indicates a familiarity with the terms used by the Greek medi- 
cal schools, and furnishes an incidental confirmation of the com- 
mon authorship of the two books. As we have seen, Luke was 
probably a Greek of Asia Minor; and, with the exception of 
Hippocrates, all the extant Greek medical writers were Asiatic 
Greeks. Hippocrates, indeed, can hardly be called an excep- 


944 INTRODUCTION TO LUKE. 


tion, as he was born and lived in the island of Cos, off the coast 
of Caria. Galen was of Pergamus in Mysia; Dioscorides, of 
Anazarba in Cilicia; and Aretaeus, of Cappadocia. 

The medical peculiarities of Luke’s style appear, first, in words 
and phrases used in descriptions of diseases or of miracles of 
healing. His terms are of the technical character peculiar to a 

-medical man. Thus, in the account of the healing of Simon’s 
wife’s mother (Luke iv. 88, 39), we read that she was taken 
(cuveyouévn) with a great fever (wupeTo peydde). The word 
taken is used nine times by Luke, and only three timesin the 
rest of the New Testament. It occurs frequently in this sense 
in the medical writers, as does also the simple verb éya, to have 
or hold. Moreover, according to Galen, the ancient physicians 
were accustomed to distinguish between great and little fevers. 
In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke xvi. 19-26), 
we find eiAKwpévos, full of sores, the regular medical term for 
to be ulcerated : dduvamat, to be in pain, occurs four times in 
Luke’s writings, and nowhere else in the New Testament, but 
frequently in Galen, Aretaeus, and Hippocrates. “E&épvée, 
gave up the ghost (Acts v. 5,10), is a rare word, used by Luke 
only, and occurring only three times in the New Testament. It 
seems to be almost confined to medical writers, and to be used 
rarely even by them. In the proverb of “the camel and the 
needle’s eye,” Matthew and Mark use for needle the vulgar word 
padis, while Luke alone uses Bedovn, the surgical needle. 

These terms will be pointed out in the notes as they occur. 

Second, the ordinary diction of the evangelist, when dealing 
with unprofessional subjects, has often a medical flavor, which 
asserts itself in words peculiar to him, or more common in his writ- 
ings than elsewhere in the New Testament, and all of which were 
in common use among the Greek physicians. Thus Matthew 
(xxiii. 4) says that the scribes and Pharisees will not move 
(kwhcat) the burdens they impose, with one of their fingers. 
Luke, recording a similar saying (xi. 46), says, “‘ ye yourselves 
touch (mpoowavere) not the burdens,” using a technical term 
for gently feeling the pulse, or a sore or tender part of the body. 
The word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. ‘No 
mean city” (donuos, Acts xxi. 39). The word mean, peculiar 


INTRODUCTION TO LUKE, QAD5 


to this passage, is the professional term for a disease without 
distinctive symptoms, and is applied by Hippocrates to a city. 
“« Delivered the letter” (avaddvres, Acts xxiii. 33). The verb 
occurs only here in the New Testament, and is a medical term 
for the distribution of blood through the veins, or of nourish- 
ment through the body. Hippocrates uses it of a messenger de- 
livering a letter. In the parable of the sower, Matthew and 
Mark have pifav, “they have no root.” Luke (viii. 6) has 
ixud&a, moisture, the medical term for the juices of the body, of 
plants, and of the earth. In the same parable, for sprung up 
Matthew and Mark have é£avéresne, while Luke has gvév—oup- 
dueicas (vv. 6, 7), it grew—grew with it (Rev.). These latter 
words are used by medical writers to describe the growth of 
parts of the body, of diseases, of vegetation, ete. Hippocrates 
uses together ixuds, moisture, and PvecIat, to grow, comparing 
the juices of the body with those of the earth. SuppverIar, 
to grow together, was the professional word for the closing of 
wounds and ulcers, the uniting of nerves and of bones, and is used 
by Dioscorides precisely as here, of plants growing together in 
the same place. 

Such peculiarities, so far from being strange or anomalous, 
are only what might naturally be expected. It is an every-day 
fact that the talk of specialists, whether in the professions or in 
mechanics, when it turns upon ordinary topics, unconsciously 
takes form and color from their familiar calling. 

The attempt has been made to show that Paul’s style was in- 
fiuenced by Luke in this same direction ; so that his intercourse 
with his companion and physician showed itself in his use of 
certain words having a medical flavor. Dean Plumptre cites as 
illustrations of this, iyvalvewv, to be healthy, in its figurative ap- 
plication to doctrine as wholesome or sownd (1 Tim. i. 10; vi. 3; 
9 Tim. i. 13): ydyypawa, canker (2 Tim. ii. 17): tupwdeis, 
lifted up with pride; Rev., puffed up (1 Tim. iii. 6; vi. 4): 
kexavTnpiacpévor, seared ; Rev., branded (1 Tim. iv. 2): «vn- 
Sopevor, itching (2 Tim. iv. 8): amoxdypovrat, cut themselves off 
(Gal. v. 12). 

Luke is also circumstantial, as well as technical, in his de- 
scriptions of diseases; noting their duration and symptoms, and 


246 INTRODUCTION TO LUKE. 


the stages of the patient’s recovery, etc. See Acts iii. 1-8; ix. 
40,41. The successive stages of Elymas’ blindness are noted 
at Acts xiii. 11; and the process of Saul’s restoration to sight 
at ix. 18. He also exhibits traces of professional sensitiveness, 
as in his omission of Mark’s implied reflection upon the physi- 
cians who had treated the woman with the issue of blood (Luke 
vill. 43; Mark v. 26). 

Luke’s accurate observation and memory appear especially 
in the Acts, in his allusions, and in his descriptions of nauti- 
cal and political matters. With nautical details, he exhibits 
the acquaintance often displayed by a landsman who has been 
much at sea and in frequent intercourse with seamen. It has 
been conjectured that at some period of his professional life he 
may have served as a surgeon on shipboard. In his political 
allusions he is precise in the use of terms. Thus, in Acts xiii. 
7, his accuracy in naming the civil magistrates is noteworthy. 
He speaks of Sergius Paulus as the proconsul of Cyprus. 
Consuls were called by the Greeks dvaro.; and hence a pro- 
consul was avdimartos, one who acts instead of (avtt) a consul. 
Roman provinces were of two classes, senatorial and imperial ; 
and the proper title of the governor of a senatorial province 
was avdumaros. The governor of an imperial province was 
called avtictparnyos, or propraetor. Evidently, therefore, Luke 
regarded Cyprus as a senatorial province, governed by a pro- 
consul ; and we find that Augustus, though at first he reserved 
Cyprus for himself, and consequently governed it by a pro- 
praetor, afterward restored it to the senate and governed it by 
a proconsul—a fact confirmed by coins of the very time of 
Paul’s visit to Cyprus, bearing the name of the emperor Clau- 
dius, and of the provincial governor, with the title dvSvmaros. 
So Luke speaks of Gallio (Acts xviii. 12) as proconsul (A. vie 
deputy) of Achaia, which was a senatorial province. When he 
comes to Felix or Festus, who were only deputy-governors of 
the propraetor of Syria, he calls them by the general term 
nyepeov, governor (Acts xxiii. 24; xxvi. 30). Similarly accurate 
is his designation of Philippi as a colonia (Acts xvi. 12), and 
his calling its magistrates otparnyol or praetors, a title which 
they were fond of giving themselves. So the city authorities 


INTRODUCTION TO LUKE. 247 


of Thessalonica are styled wodutdpyar, rulers of the city (Acts 
xvii. 8) ; for Thessalonica was a free city, having the right of 
self-government, and where the local magistrates had the power 
of life and death over the citizens. Luke’s accuracy on this 
point is borne out by an inscription on an archway in Thessa- 
lonica, which gives this title to the magistrates of the place, 
together with their number—seven—and the very names of some 
who held the office not long before Paul’s time. This short in- 
scription contains six names which are mentioned in the New 
Testament. We may also note the Aszarchs, chiefs of Asia, at 
Ephesus (Acts xix. 31), who, like the aediles at Rome, defrayed 
the charge of public amusements, and were, as presidents of the 
games, invested with the character of priests. 

A similar accuracy appears in the Gospel in the dates of 
more important events, and in local descriptions, as of the 
Lord’s coming to Jerusalem across the Mount of Olives (xix. 
37-41). Here he brings out the two distinct views of Jeru- 
salem on this route, an irregularity in the ground hiding it for 
a time after one has just caught sight of it. Verse 37 marks 
the first sight, and 41 the second. 

In the narrative of the voyage and shipwreck, the precision of 
detail is remarkable. Thus there are fourteen verbs denoting 
the progression of a ship, with a distinction indicating the pecu- 
liar circumstances of the ship at the time. Seven of these are 
compounds of wAée, to sail. Thus we have amém)evoay, sailed 
away (xiii. 4); Bpadumdoobvres, sailing slowly (xxvii. 7); 
imerdetcapev, sailed wnder (the lee). So, also, wapareyopevot, 
hardly passing (xxvii. 8); evIvépopjcaper, ran with a straight 
course (xvi. 11), ete. Note also the technical terms for lighten- 
ing the ship by throwing overboard the cargo: é«Bodny érrou- 
oovro; literally, made a casting out (xxvii. 18); éxovdifov, 
lightened (xxvii. 88); and the names of various parts of the 
vessel. 

Luke’s Gospel is the gospel of contrasts. Thus Satan is 
constantly emphasized over against Jesus, as binding a daughter 
of Abraham; as cast down from heaven in Jesus’ vision; as 
entering into Judas; as sifting Peter. The evangelist portrays 
the doubting Zacharias and the trusting Mary; the churlish 


248 INTRODUCTION TO LUKE. 


Simon and the loving sinner; the bustling Martha and the 
quiet, adoring Mary; the thankful and the thankless lepers; 
the woes added to the blessings in the Sermon on the Mount; 
the rich man and Lazarus ; the Pharisee and the Publican; the 
good Samaritan and the priest and Levite; the prodigal and 
his elder brother ; the penitent and impenitent thieves. 

Luke’s is the wniversal gospel. His frequent use of words 
expressing the freedom and universality of the Gospel has al- 
ready been noted. His Gospel is for the Gentiles. The gene- 
alogy of Christ is traced back to the common father of the race, 
Adam, instead of to Abraham, the father of the Jewish nation, 
as by Matthew. He records the enrolment of Christ as a citi- 
zen of the Roman empire. Simeon greets him as a light for 
revelation to the Gentiles. The Baptist cites concerning him 
Isaiah’s prophecy that add flesh shall see the salvation of God. 
Luke alone records the mission of the seventy, who represent the 
seventy Gentile nations, as the twelve represent the twelve tribes 
of Israel. He alone mentions the mission of Elijah to the 
heathen widow, and Naaman’s cleansing by Elisha. He con- 
trasts the gratitude of the one Samaritan leper with the thank- 
lessness of the nine Jewish lepers. He alone records the refusal 
to call down fire on the inhospitable Samaritans, and the parable 
of the Good Samaritan is peculiar to him. He notes the com- 
mendation of the humble Publican in contrast with the self- 
righteous Pharisee, and relates how Jesus abode with Zacchaeus. 
He omits all reference to the law in the Sermon on the Mount. 

Luke’s is the gospel of the poor and outcast. As a phase of 
its universality, the humblest and most sinful are shown as not 
excluded from Jesus. The highest heavenly honor is conferred 
on the humble Mary of Nazareth. Only in Luke’s story do we 
hear the angels’ song of “Peace and good-will,” and see the 
simple shepherds repairing to the manger at Bethlehem. It is 
Luke who gives the keynote of Keble’s lovely strain: 


‘“The pastoral spirits first 
Approach thee, Babe divine, 
For they in lowly thoughts are nurs’d, 
Meet for thy lowly shrine: 
Sooner than they should miss where thou dost dwell, 
Angels from heaven will stoop to guide them to thy cell.” 


INTRODUCTION TO LUKE. 249 


He pictures poor Lazarus in Abraham’s bosom, and the call- 
ing of the poor and maimed and halt and blind to the great 
supper. It is the gospel of the publican, the harlot, the prodi- 
gal, the penitent thief. 

Luke’s is the gospel of womanhood. Woman comes promi- 
nently into view as discerning God’s promises. The songs of 
Mary and Elizabeth, and the testimony of Anna, are full of a 
clear spiritual perception, no less than of a living and simple 
faith. She appears as ministering to the Lord and as the 
subject of his ministries. Mary of Magdala, Joanna, Susan- 
na, Mary and Martha, with others, lavish upon him their ten- 
der care; while the daughter of Abraham whom Satan had 
bound, the sorrowful mother at Nain, she who touched the hem 
of his garment, and the weeping daughters of Jerusalem on the 
road to Calvary knew the comfort of his words and the healing 
and life-giving virtue of his touch. The word yuvy, woman, 
occurs in Matthew and Mark together forty-nine times, and in 
Luke alone forty-three. “He alone,” says Canon Farrar, 
‘preserves the narratives, treasured with delicate reserve and 
holy reticence in the hearts of the blessed Virgin and of the 
saintly Elizabeth—narratives which show in every line the pure 
and tender coloring of a woman’s thoughts.” 

Luke’s is the prayer-gospel. To him we are indebted for the 
record of our Lord’s prayers at his baptism; after the cleansing 
of the leper; before the call of the twelve; at his transfigura- 
tion; and on the cross for his enemies. To him alone belong 
the prayer-parables of the Friend at Midnight, and the Unjust 
Judge. 

Luke’s is the gospel of song. He has been justly styled “the 
first Christian hymnologist.” To him we owe the Benedictus, 
the song of Zacharias; the Magnificat, the song of Mary; the 
Nune Dimittis, the song of Simeon; the Ave Maria, or the 
angel’s salutation; and the Gloria m Faxcelsis, the song of 
the angels. 

And, finally, Luke’s is the gospel of infancy. He alone tells 
the story of the birth of John the Baptist; he gives the mi- 
nuter details of the birth of Christ, and the accounts of his 
circumcision and presentation in the temple, his subjection to 


250 INTRODUCTION TO LUKE. 


his parents and the questioning with the doctors. His Gospel 
‘sheds a sacred halo and celestial charm over infancy, as per- 
petuating the paradise of innocence in a sinful world. The 
first two chapters will always be the favorite chapters for chil- 
dren, and all who delight to gather around the manger of 
Bethlehem, and to rejoice with shepherds in the field and 
angels in heaven” (Schaff). 


THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE. 


OHAPTHE I 
PROLOGUE. 


1. Forasmuch as (ézecénrep). Only here in New Testa- 
ment. A compound conjunction: é7re/, since, dy, as as well 
known, and mep, giving the sense of certainty. 


Have taken in hand (ézreyeipnoav). Used by Luke only. 
A literal translation. The word carries the sense of a difficult 
undertaking (see Acts xix. 13), and implies that previous at- 
tempts have not been successful. It occurs frequently in medi- 
cal language. Hippocrates begins one of his medical treatises 
very much as Luke begins his gospel. “As many as have 
taken in hand (érexelpnoav) to speak or to write concerning the 
healing art.” 


To set forth in order (dvardfac3a). Only here in New 
Testament. The A. V. is true to the core of the word, which 
is rdcow, to put in order, or arrange. Rev. happily gives the 
force of the preposition ava, wp, by the rendering draw up. 


A declaration (8ujynow). Only here in New Testament. 
From 8:4, through, and rjyéoar, to lead the way. Hence some- 
thing which leads the reader through the mass of facts: a nar- 
rative, as A. V., with the accompanying idea of thoroughness. 
Note the singular number. any took in hand to draw up, 
not narratives, but a narrative, embracing the whole of the 


252 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. cores, 10, 


evangelic matter. The word was particularly applied to a 
medical treatise. Galen applies it at least seventy-three times 
to the writings of Hippocrates. 


Which are most surely believed (trav memAnpodopnpévor). 
From wAnpns, full, and hopéw, the frequentative form of dépo, 
to bring, meaning to bring frequently or habitually. Hence, to 
bring full measure ; to fulfil. Compare 2 Tim. iv.5,17. Also 
of full assurance. Applied to persons. Rom. iv. 21; Heb. x. 
22. As applied to things, therefore, the sense of the A. V. is 
inadmissible. Render as Rev., have been fulfilled. The word 
is chosen to indicate that these events happened in accordance 
with a preconceived design. Wyc., been filled in us. 


Among us, Explained by the words in the next sentence, 
who were eye-witnesses and ministers. 


2. Even as. Referring to the composition of the narrative. 


Delivered (arapédocav). Not necessarily excluding written 
traditions, but referring mainly to oral tradition. Note the dis- 
tinction between the many who attempted to draw up a narra- 
tive and the eye-witnesses and ministers who handed down the 
facts. 


From the beginning (a7 dpyfs). The official beginning, 
the commencement of Jesus’ ministry. Compare Acts i. 1, 21, 
22; John xv. 27. 


Eye-witnesses and ministers. Personal knowledge and 
practical experrence were necessary elements of an apostle. 
Eye-witnesses (abtomrat). Only here in New Testament. Peter 
uses another word, éromras (2 Pet. i. 16). Frequent in medi- 
cal writers, of a personal examination of disease or of the parts 
of the body. Compare the modern medical term autopsy. 
Ministers (imnpéra). See on Matt. v.25. In medical lan- 
guage denoting the attendants or assistants of the principal 
physician. 


Cx. 1.] LUKE. 253 


3. Having had perfect understanding (aapnxorovSnKdr:). 
Incorrect. The verb means to follow closely, and hence to 
trace accurately. See 2 Tim. iii. 10, where Rev. reads thou 
didst follow for thou hast fully known. Rev. renders here 
hawing traced the course. The word occurs frequently in medi- 
cal writings, and sometimes, as here, with dxpiBas, accurately. 
Tynd., having searched out diligently. 


From the very first (avwJev). Lit., from above; the events 
being conceived in a descending series. 


Accurately (axpi8as) From d«por, the highest or farthest 
pot. Hence to trace down to the last and minutest detail. 


In order (xcadeEjs). Used by Luke only. 


4. Mightest know (ézuyvas). See on Matt. vii. 16. With 
the idea of ful/ knowledge ; or, as regards Theophilus, of more 
accurate knowledge than is possible from the many who have 
undertaken the narration. 


Certainty (acdddreav). From a, not, and odddXopa, to 
fall. Hence steadfastness, stability, security against error. 


Wast instructed (xarjynIns). From xarnyéw, to resound ; 
to teach by word of mouth ; and so, in Christian writers, to in- 
struct orally in the elements of religion. It would imply that 
Theophilus had, thus far, been orally instructed. See on de- 
livered, ver. 2. The word catechumen is derived from it. 


Things (Adywv). Properly words (so Wyc.), which Rey. 
gives in margin. If the word can mean thing at all, it is only 
in the sense of the thing spoken of ; the subject or matter of 
discourse, in which sense it occurs often in classical Greek. 
Some render it accounts, histories; others, doctrines of the 
futh. Godet translates ¢mstruction, and claims that not only 
the facts of the gospel, but the exposition of the facts with a 
view to show their evangelical meaning and to their appropria- 


954 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. I. 


tion by faith, are included in the word. There is force in this 
idea; and if we hold to the meaning histories, or even words, 
this sense will be implied in the context. Luke has drawn up 
his account in order that Theophilus may have fuller knowledge 
concerning the accounts which he has heard by word of mouth. 
That his knowledge may go on from the facts, to embrace their 
doctrinal and evangelical import; that he may see the facts of 
Jesus’ life and ministry as the true basis of the Gospel of 
salvation. 


THE NARRATIVE. 


5. King. A title decreed to Herod by the Roman Senate 
on the recommendation of Antony and Octavius. The Greek 
style now gives place to the Hebraized style. See Introduction. 


Course (épypepias). Lit., dacly service. The college of 
priests was divided into twenty-four courses. Each of these 
did duty for eight days, from one Sabbath to another, once 
every six months. The service of the week was subdivided 
among the various families which constituted a course. On Sab- 
baths the whole course was on duty. On feast-days any priest 
might come up and join in the ministrations of the sanctuary ; 
and at the Feast of Tabernacles all the twenty-four courses were 
bound to be present and officiate. The course of Abijah was 
the eighth of the twenty-four. See 1 Chron. xxiv. 10. 


6. Before God. A Hebrew expression. Compare Gen. vii. 
L; Acts vitie21s 


7. Well stricken (apoBeBnxortes). Lit., advanced. Wyc., 
had gone far in their days. 


9. His lot was (€raye). Four lots were drawn to determine 
the order of the ministry of the day: the first, before day- 
break, to designate the priests who were to cleanse the altar 
and prepare its fires ; the second for the priest who was to offer 
the sacrifice and cleanse the candlestick and the altar of incense ; 


Cry LUKE. 955 


the third for the priest who should burn incense ; and the fourth 
appointing those who were to lay the sacrifice and meat-offering 
on the altar, and pour out the drink-offering. There are said 
to have been twenty thousand priests in Christ’s time, so that 
no priest would ever offer incense more than once. 


Temple (vaov). The sanctuary. See on Matt. iv. 5. 


Burn incense (Juuiacar). Only here in New Testament. 
The incensing priest and his assistants went first to the altar 
of burnt-offering, and filled a golden censer with incense, and 
placed burning coals from the altar in a golden bowl. As they 
passed into the court from the Holy Place they struck a large 
instrument called the Magrephah, which summoned all the min- 
isters to their places. Ascending the steps to the holy place, the 
priests spread the coals on the golden altar, and arranged the 
incense, and the chief officiating priest was then left alone within 
the Holy Place to await the signal of the president to burn the 
incense. It was probably at this time that the angel appeared 
to Zacharias. When the signal was given, the whole multitude 
withdrew from the inner court, and fell down before the Lord. 
Silence pervaded the temple, while within, the clouds of incense 
rose up before Jehovah. (For a more detailed account see 
Edersheim, ‘‘ The Temple, its Ministry,” etc.). 


13. Is heard (etonxovadn). If we render the aorist literally, 
was heard, we avoid the question as to what prayer is referred 
to. The reference is to the prayer, for offspring, which, owing 
to his extreme years, Zacharias had probably ceased to offer, 
and which he certainly would not be preferring in that public 
and solemn service. Hence the aorist is appropriate, referring 
back to the past actsof prayer. ‘“ That prayer, which thou no 
longer offerest, was heard.” 


John. Meaning God is favorable, or Jehovah showeth grace. 


14. Joy and gladness (yapd Kai ayaddlacis). The latter 
word expresses ewultant joy. See on 1 Pet.i. 6. 


256 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. I. 


15. Strong drink (cixepa), A Hebrew word, meaning any 
kind of intoxicating liquor not made from grapes. Wyc., sydir. 


Even from his mother’s womb. "E7u, yet, still, means 
while yet unborn. Tynd., even in his mother’s womb. Compare 
ver. 41. 


17. Wisdom (dpovice). Wyc., prudence. This is a lower 
word than codia, wisdom (see on Jas. iii. 13). It is an attre- 
bute or result of wisdom, and not necessarily in a good sense, 
though mostly so in the New Testament. Compare, however, the 
use of the kindred word @poviwos in Rom. xi. 25; xii. 16: wese 
in your own conceits ; and the adverb ¢poviuws, wisely, of the 
unjust steward, Luke xvi. 8. It is practical intelligence, which 
may or may not be applied to good ends. Appropriate here as 
a practical term corresponding to desobedient. 


Prepared (xatacxevacpévov). Adjusted, disposed, placed m 
the right moral state. 


18. Whereby («ara ri). Lit., according to what? It de- 
mands a standard of knowledge, a sign. 


For. I require a sign, for I am old. 


19. Gabriel. Meaning man of God. In Jewish tradition the 
guardian of the sacred treasury. Michael (see on Jude 9) is 
the destroyer, the champion of God against evil, the minister 
of wrath. Gabriel is the messenger of peace and restoration. 
See Dan. viii. 16; ix. 21. ‘The former is the forerunner 
of Jehovah the Judge; the latter of Jehovah the Saviour” 
(Godet). 


20. Thou shalt be silent (07 cuwrdv). Lit., thow shalt be 
beong silent. The finite verb and participle denote continuance. 


Not able to speak. Showing that the silence would not be 
voluntary. 


Cu. 1.] LUKE. 257 


My words which (oftwes). The pronoun is qualitative, de- 
noting aclass. ‘“ My words, which, incredible as they seem to 
you, are of a kind which shall be fulfilled. 


In their season (e/s tov xaspov). The preposition implies 
exactness: at the completion of the appointed time. The pro- 
cess of fulfilment, beginning now, will go on, ets, wp to, the ap- 
pointed time, and a¢ the time will be consummated. Kazpor, 
season, is more specific than ypdvos, time. It is an appointed, 
jitting time: the right point of time when circumstances shall 
concur. 


21. Waited (%v mpocdoxav). The finite verb and participle, 
denoting protracted waiting. Hence, better as Rev., were wazt- 
ing. Wye., was abiding. 


Marvelled. According to the Talmud, the priests, especially 
the chief priests, were accustomed to spend only a short time in 
the sanctuary, otherwise it was feared that they had been slain 
by God for unworthiness or transgression. 


22. They perceived (ézréyvwoav). Clearly perceived. See 
on Matt. vii. 16, and ver. 4. 


He beckoned (%v dvavevov). Better Rev., continued making 
signs. Again the participle with the finite verb, denoting fre- 
quent repetition of the same signs. Wryc., was beckoning. 


23. Ministration (Aevtoupyias). From elros, belonging to the 
people, public, and épyov, a work. Hence service of the state in 
a public office. ‘Trench observes that “when the Christian 
Church was forming its terminology, which it did partly by 
shaping new words, and partly by elevating old ones to higher 
than their previous uses, of the latter it more readily adopted 
those before employed in civil and political life, than such as 
had played their part in religious matters.” Hence it adopted 
this word, already in use in the Septuagint, as the constant word 
for performing priestly and ministerial functions ; and so in

the New Testament of the ministry of the apostles, prophets, 
and teachers. 


24. Conceived (cuvédaBev). Mr. Hobart (“ Medical Lan- 
guage of Luke”) says that the number of words referring to 
pregnancy, barrenness, etc., used by Luke, is almost as large as 
that used by Hippocrates. Compare i. 381; i. 24; 1.551. 7; 
xx, 28. All of these, except i. 24, are peculiar to himself, and 
all, of course, in common use among medical writers. 


Hid (cepuexpuBev). Only here in New Testament. Hepu 
signifies completely ; entire seclusion. 


25. Neither A. V. nor Rev. render 67z; taking it, as fre- 
quently, merely as recitative or equivalent to quotation marks. 
But it means because. Elizabeth assigns the reason for her 
peculiar seclusion. Her pregnancy was God’s work, and she 
would leave it to him also to announce it and openly to take 
away her reproach. Hence the specification of jive months, after 
which her condition would become apparent. Fully expressed, 
the sense would be: She hid herself, saying (I have hid myself) 
because, ete. 


Looked upon (ézreidev). Used by Luke only. 


26. Gabriel. The annunciation and the angel Gabriel are 
favorite themes with Dante, and he pictures them with exqui- 
site beauty. Thus both appear on the sculptured wall which 
flanks the inner side of the purgatorial ascent. 


‘“‘The angel who came down to earth with tidings 
Of peace that had been wept for many a year, 
And opened heaven from its long interdict, 

In front of us appeared so truthfully 
There sculptured in a gracious attitude, 
He did not seem an image that is silent. 
One would have sworn that he was saying Ave/ 
For she was there in effigy portrayed 
Who turned the key to ope the exalted love, 
And in her mien this language had impressed, 
Eece ancilla Dei! as distinctly 
As any figure stamps itself in wax.” 
Purgatory, x., 34-45. 


Cu. 1] LUKE. 259 


In Paradise Gabriel appears as a light circling round the Vir- 
gin and singing: 
““T am angelic love, that circle round 
The joy sublime which breathes out from the womb 
That was the hostelry of our desire ; 
And I shall circle, Lady of heaven, while 
Thou followest thy Son, and mak’st diviner 
The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there.” 
Paradise, xxiii., 103-108. 
And again: 
‘¢ And the same love that first descended then, 
Ave Maria gratia plena singing, 
In front of her his wings expanded wide.” 
Paradise, xxxii., 94-96. 


28. Thou that art highly favored (keyapitwpévn). Lit., as 
Rev. in margin, endued with grace. Only here and Eph. i. 6. 
The rendering full of grace, Vulgate, Wyc., and Tynd., is there- 
fore wrong. 

All the best texts omit blessed art thou among women. 


Cast in her mind (dcedoyifero ). See on Jas. ii. 4. The 
imperfect tense, ‘‘ began to reason.” 


30. Grace (yapw). From the same root as yalpa, to rejoice. 
I. Primarily that which giwes joy or pleasure ; and hence out- 
ward beauty, loveliness, something which delights the beholder. 
Thus Homer, of Ulysses going to the assembly : ‘‘ Athene shed 
down manly grace or beauty upon him” (“ Odyssey,” ii., 12) ; 
and Septuagint, Ps. xlv. 3, “grace is poured into thy lips.” 
See also Prov. i. 9; iii, 22. Substantially the same idea, 
agreeableness, is conveyed in Luke iv. 22, respecting the gra- 
cious words, lit., words of grace, uttered by Christ. So Eph. 
iv. 29. II. As a beautiful or agreeable sentiment felt and ex- 
pressed toward another; kindness, favor, good-will. 2 Cor. 
viii. 6, 7, 9; ix. 8; Luke i. 30; ii. 40; Acts ii. 47. So of the 
responsive sentiment of thankfulness. See Luke vi. 32, 33, 34 ; 
xvii. 9; but mostly in the formula thanks to God; Rom. vi. 
17; 1 Cor. xv.57; 2 Cor. ii. 14; 2 Tim. i. 3. III. The sudstan-

tial expression of good-will ; a boon, a favor, a gift; but not 
in New Testament. See Rom. v. 15, where the distinction is 
made between ydpus, grace, and Swped év ydpute, a gift im grace. 
So a gratification or delight, in classical Greek only ; as the de- 
light in battle, in sleep, ete. IV. The higher Christian signi- 
fication, based on the emphasis of freeness in the gift or favor, 
and, as commonly in New Testament, denoting the free, spon- 
taneous, absolute loving-kindness of God toward men, and so 
contrasted with debt, law, works, sin. The word does not occur 
either in Matthew or Mark. 


31. Thou shalt conceive. See on ver. 24. 
Jesus. See on Matt. i. 21. 


35. Shall overshadow. “Denoting the mildest and most 
gentle operation of divine power, that the divine fire should 
not consume Mary, but make her fruitful ” (Bengel). Compare 
Exod. xxxiii. 22; Mark ix.7. Compare the classical legend of 
Semele, who, being beloved of Jove, besought him to appear to 
her as he appeared in heaven, in all the terrors of the thun- 
derer, and was consumed by his lightning. The metaphor in 
the word is taken from a cloud, in which God had appeared 
(Exod. xl. 34; 1 Kings viii. 10). 


36. Cousin (cvyyevyns). The nature of the relationship, 
however, is unknown. The word is a general term, meaning 
of the same family. The best texts substitute for it a feminine 
form, cvyyevds, which is condemned by the grammarians as un- 
classical, but rightly rendered by Rev., kinswoman. Wyc., 
COSYNESS, 1.€., COUSINESS. 


37. With God nothing shall be impossible (ov« dédvup- 
aTnoe. Tapa Tov Oeod wav phya). ‘Piya, word, as distinguished 
from Adyos, word, in classical Greek, signifies a constituent part 
of a speech or writing, as distinguished from the contents as a 
whole. Thus it may be either a@ word or a saying. Some- 
times @ phrase, as opposed to dvoua, a single word. The dis. 


Cx. 1] LUKE. 261 


tinction in the New Testament is not sharp throughout. It is 
maintained that pjwa in the New Testament, like the Hebrew 
gabar, stands sometimes for the subject-matter of the word; 
the thing, as in this passage. But there are only two other 
passages in the New Testament where this meaning is at all ad- 
missible, though the word occurs seventy times. These are 
Luke ii. 15; Actsv.32. “ Kept all these things” (Luke ii. 19), 
should clearly be sayings, as the A. V. itself has rendered it in 
the almost identical passage, ver.51. In Acts v. 32, Rev. gives 
sayings in margin. In Luke ii. 15, though A. V. and Rey. 
render thing, the sense is evidently saying, as appears both from 
the connection with the angelic message and from the following 
words, which has come to pass: the saying which has become 
a fact. The Rey. rendering of this passage is, therefore, right, 
though a little stilted: Wo word of God shall be void of 
power ; for the A. V. errs in joining ov« and wav, not every, 
and translating nothing. The two do not belong together. The 
statement is, Avery (av) word of God shall not (ov) be power- 
less. The A. V. also follows the reading, rapa To Oe@, with 
God ; but all the later texts read zrapa Tob Ocod, from Cod, 
which fixes the meaning beyond question. 


40. Entered into the house. “This detail,” says Godet, 
“serves to put the reader in sympathy with the emotion of 
Mary at the moment of her arrival. With her first glance at 
Elizabeth she recognized the truth of the sign that had been 
given her by the angel, and at this sight the promise she had 
herself received acquired a startling reality.” 


41. The babe (7d Bpédos). See on 1 Pet. ii. 2. 


42. She spake out with aloud voice (avefavnce dwvy je- 
yarn). For davh, voice, read cpavyi, cry: inarticulate, though 
féwvn may also be used of inarticulate utterance. Rey., rightly, 
She lifted up her voice with a loud ery ; thus rendering in the 
verb the force of ava, wp, besides picturing the fact more natur- 
ally. Elizabeth’s sudden and violent emotion at the appearance 
of Mary, and the movement of the child, prompted an exclama- 


262 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. 1 


tion which was followed by words (eizrev, said). ‘The verb ava- 
gwvéw occurs only here in the New Testament. It was a med- 
ical term for a certain exercise of the voice. 


44. For joy (év ayadddoee). Lit., in joy. See on ver. 14. 


45. For (67). Many, however, prefer that, referring to the 
substance of her belief: ‘“ She believed that there shall be a 
fulfilment,” etc. It is urged that the conception, which was 
the principal point of faith, had already taken place, so that the 
fulfilment was no longer future. On the other hand, the angel’s 
announcement to Mary included more than the fact of concep- 
tion; and Elizabeth, in the spirit of prophecy, may have alluded 
to what is predicted in vv. 82, 33. 


46. Said (elev). Simply. Compare ver. 42. “ Elizabeth’s 
salutation was full of excitement, but Mary’s hymn breathes a 
sentiment of deep inward repose” (Godet). Compare the song 
of Hannah (1 Sam. ii.). Hannah’s song differs from Mary’s in 
its sense of indignation and personal triumph compared with 
Mary’s humility and calmness. 


My soul—spirit (uy7j—vedua). See on Mark xii.30. The 
sowl is the principle of individuality, the seat of personal im- 
pressions, having a side in contact with the material element of 
humanity, as well as with the spiritual element. It is thus 
the mediating organ between the spirit and the body, receiving 
impressions from without and from within, and transmitting 
them by word or sign. Spirit is the highest, deepest, noblest 
part of our humanity, the point of contact between God and 
man. 


47. God my Saviour (70 0ed 7 cwripi pov). Note the two 
articles. ‘ Zhe God who is the or my Saviour.” The title Sav- 
iour is often applied to God in the Old Testament. See Septua- 
gint, Deut. xxxii. 15; Ps. xxiv. 5; xxv. 5; xev. 1. 


48. Regarded (éréBrewev). See on Jas, ii. 8. Compare 1 
Samoiv1s. Ps: xxxi. 7; cxix. 132, Sept.

50. Mercy (édcos). The word emphasizes the mzsery with 
which grace (see on ver. 30) deals ; hence, peculiarly the sense 
of human wretchedness coupled with the impulse to relieve it, 
which issues in gracious ministry. Bengel remarks, “Grace 
takes away the fault, mercy the misery.” 


From generation to generation (eis yeveds Kal ryeveds). 
Lit., as Rev., wnto generations and generations. 


Fear (foSovpévos). The word is used in both a good and a 
bad sense in the New Testament. For the latter, see Matt. 
xxi. 46; Mark vi. 20; xi. 32; Luke xii. 4. For the former, as 
here, in the sense of godly reverence, Acts x. 2, 22,355; Col. iii. 
22; Apoe. xiv. 7; xv. 4. 


51. Shewed strength (érroincev patos). Lit., made strength. 
So Wyc., made might. A Hebrew form of expression. Com- 
pare Ps. exviii. 15, Sept.: “The right hand of the Lord doeth 
valiantly” (éroince divapwv, made strength). 


In the imagination (d:avoia). The faculty of thought, un- 
derstanding, especially moral understanding. Wye. refers the 
word here to God: with mind of his heart. Some prefer to 
render “dy the imagination,” thus making the proud the instru- 
ment of their own destruction. Compare 2 Cor. x. 5. 


54. Hath holpen (avtevaBéro). The verb means to lay hold 
on: thence to grasp helpfully or to help. To lay hold in the 
sense of partaking (1 Tim. vi. 2), carries us back to the primi- 
tive meaning of the word according to its composition: to re- 
ceive instead of, or in return (ari), and suggests the old phrase 
to take up for, espouse the cause of. Weyce., has took up, but prob- 
ably not in this sense. 


Servant (ras50s). Often child, son or daughter, but here ser- 
vant, in allusion to Isa. xli. 8. Meyer truthfully says that the 
theocratic notion of sonship is never expressed by sais. See 
Rev., Acts iii. 18, 26; iv. 27, 30.

58. Had shewed great mercy upon her (cueydAuvev 7d 
eos avTod wer” avths). Lit., magnified his mercy with her. 
So Wye. A Hebrew expression. See 1 Sam. xii. 24, Sept. 


59. They called (écaAovv). The imperfect tense signifies, as 
Rev., they would have called : they were about to call: or, as 
Bishop Lightfoot has happily suggested, they were for calling. 


62. They made signs (évévevov). Imperfect tense. While the 
colloquy between Elizabeth and her friends was going on, they 
were consulting Zacharias by signs. 


63. Writing-table (aiwaxidiov). Table was formerly used 
in the sense of tablet. Thus Shakspeare: 


‘Yea, from the table of my memory, 
Pll wipe away all trivial fond records.” 
Hamiet, i., 5. 


Tynd., writing-tables. The meaning is a little writing-tablet, 
probably covered with wax. Only here in the New Testament. 
Used by medical writers of a physician’s note-book. Wye. has 
a poyntel, i.e., a style for writing. 


Wrote, saying. A Hebrew form of expression. See 2 
Kings x. 6. 


64. Immediately (zapayphwa). Occurring nineteen times in 
the New Testament, and seventeen of these in Luke. Thirteen 
of the seventeen are in connection with miracles of healing, or 
the infliction of disease or death. Used in a similar way by 
medical writers. 


65. Were noised abroad (SvadeXciro). Were mutually (81) 
talked of. 


69. Horn. Compare Ps. exxxii. 17. 


Cx. I.) LUKE. 965 


70. That have been since the world began (a7 aidvos). 
A needlessly verbose rendering, retained by Rev. The Ameri- 
can Rev. insists on of old. 


74. Serve (Aatpevew). Originally to serve for hire, from 
Adtpov, hire. Plato uses it of the service of God. 


75. Holiness and righteousness (ocwrTnre Kai Suxavocvry). 
The adjective dcvos, holy, is properly what is confirmed by an- 
cient sanction and precept. ‘Ocia is used in classical Greek to 
denote the everlasting principles of right, not constituted by the 
laws or customs of men, but antedating them ; such as the pay- 
ing of the proper rites of sepulture. Compare the fine passage 
in the “ Antigone” of Sophocles (453-55) : 


‘‘ Nor did I deem thy edicts strong enough, 
That thou, a mortal man, shouldst overpass 
The unwritten laws of God that know not change. 
They are not of to-day nor yesterday, 
But live forever, nor can man assign 
When first they sprang to being.” 


Hence écvérns is concerned primarily with the eternal laws of 
God. It is “the divine consecration and inner truth of right- 
cousness” (Meyer). Throughout the New Testament its look 
is godward. In no case is it used of moral excellence as re- 
lated to men, though it is to be carefully noted that decasoovyn, 
righteousness, is not restricted to rightness toward men. Com- 
pare Eph. iv. 24; true holiness ; literally, holuness of the truth. 


77. Knowledge of salvation. Wye. has the science of 
health. 


78. Tender mercy (amddyxva édéovs). Lit., bowels of 
mercy. See on 1 Pet. iii. 8; Jas. v. 11. Rev. gives heart of 
mercy in margin. Wye., frightfully, entradls of mercy. 


The day-spring from on high (avatody e€ inpous). Lit., 
the rising. The word occurs in the Septuagint as a rendering 


266 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. II. 


of branch, as something resing or springing up, by which the 
Messiah is denoted (Jer. xxiii. 5; Zech. vi. 12). Also of the 
rising of a heavenly body (Isa. 1x. 19, Sept.). Compare the 
kindred verb arise (avaréXXAqw) in Isa. lx. 1; Mal. iv. 2. This 
latter is the sense here. See on Matt. ii. 2. Wye. has he 
springing up from on high. 


Hath visited (érecxéato). See on Matt. xxv. 36; 1 Pet. ii. 
12. Some, however, read érickéwerai, shall visit. So Rev. 


79. To guide (xatevddvar). From evdis, straight. Wye. 
has dress, which is formed through the old French dresser, to 
arrange, from the Latin dirigere, to set in a straight line, draw 
up. Hence the military term dress for arranging a line. 


80. The deserts (rais épnuos). The article indicating a 
well-known place. 


Shewing (avadeiEews). The word was used of the public 
announcement of an official nomination; hence of the public 
inauguration of John’s ministry. 


CHAPTER. II. 


1. Decree (Soyua). Wyc.,mandment. From Soxéo, to think. 
Hence, strictly, a personal opinion ; and, as the opinion of one 
who can impose his opinion authoritatively on others, a decree. 


The world (rv oixoupévnr). Lit., the inhabited (land). The 
phrase was originally used by the Greeks to denote the land 
inhabited by themselves, in contrast with barbarian countries; 
afterward, when the Greeks became subject to the Romans, 
the entire Roman world; still later, for the whole inhabited 
world. In the New Testament this latter is the more common 
usage, though, in some cases, this is conceived in the mould of 
the Roman empire, as in this passage, Acts xi. 28; xix. 27. 
Christ uses it in the announcement that the Gospel shall be 


Cu. IL] LUKE. 267 


preached im all the world (Matt. xxiv. 14); and Paul in the 
prediction of a general judgment (Acts xvii. 31). Once it is 
used of the world to come (Heb. ii. 5). 


Be taxed (aroypddecSar). The word means properly to 
register or enter in a list. Commentators are divided as to 
whether it refers to an enrolment for taxation, or for ascer- 
taining the population. Rev., enrolled, which may be taken in 
either sense. 


2. And this taxing was first made (avr 1) dmoypady 
mpaTn éyéveto). Rather, this occurred as the first enrolment ; 
or, as Rev., thes was the first enrolment made ; with reference 
to a second enrolment which took place about eleven years 
later, and is referred to in Acts y. 37. 


3. Went (érropevovto). The A. V. and Rev. alike miss the 
graphic force of the imperfect tense, were going. The prepara- 
tion and bustle and travel were in progress. 


To his own city. The town to which the village or place 
of their birth belonged, and where the house and lineage of 
each were registered. 


4. House and lineage. According to the Jewish mode of 
registration the people would be enrolled by éribes, families or 
clans, and households. Compare Josh. vii. 16-18. Rev., house 
and family. 


5. To be taxed with Mary. We may read either, went up 
with Mary, denoting merely the fact of her accompanying him; 
or, to enrol himself with Mary, implying that both their names 
must be registered. 


Espoused. Not merely betrothed. See Matt. i. 20, 24, 25 ; 
also on Matt. i. 18. 


Great with child (éy«vm). See on Ch. i. 24. Only here in 
New Testament.

7. Her first-born son. The Greek reads literally, her son, 
the first-born. 


Wrapped in swaddling-clothes (éc7apydvwcev). Only 
here and ver. 12. Naturally found often in medical writings. 
Swaddle is swathel, from the verb to swathe. 


In a manger (év ¢ddtvy). Used by Luke only, here and 
xiii. 15. Wye. has @ eracche, spelt also cratch. Compare 
French créche, a manger. Quite possibly a rock-cave. Dr. 
Thomson says: “I have seen many such, consisting of one or 
more rooms, in front of and including a cavern where the cattle 


were kept” (“ Land and Book”), 


In the inn (€v 76 xatadvpare). Only here, ch. xxiii. 11; 
Mark xiv. 14, on which see note. In both these passages it is 
rendered guest-chamber, which can hardly be the meaning here, 
as some have maintained. (See Geikie, “ Life and Words of 
Christ,” i, 121.) In that case the expression would be, they 
found no catdAvpa, guest-chamber. The word refers to the ordi- 
nary khan, or caravanserat. Tynd., hostrey. “A Syrian khan 
is a fort and a mart; a refuge from thieves; a shelter from 
the heat and dust; a place where a man and his beast may 
lodge ; where a trader may sell his wares, and a pilgrim may 
slake his thirst. . . . Where built by a great sheikh, it 
would have a high wall, an inner court, a range of arches or 
lewans, an open gallery round the four sides, and, in many cases, 
a tower from which the watcher might descry the approach of 
marauding bands. On one side of the square, but outside the 
wall, there is often a huddle of sheds, set apart from the main 
edifice, as stables for the asses and camels, the buffaloes and 
goats. In the centre of the khan springs a fountain of water, 
the first necessity of an Arab’s life; and around the jets and 
troughs in which the limpid element streams, lies the gay and 
picturesque litter of the East. Camels wait to be unloaded ; 
dogs quarrel for a bone; Bedaween from the desert, their red 
zannars choked with pistols, are at prayer. In the archways 
squat the merchants with their bales of goods. . . . Half- 


Cu. II.] LUKE. 269 


naked men are cleansing their hands ere sitting down to eat. 
Here a barber is at work upon a shaven crown; there a fellah 
lies asleep in the shade. . . . Each man has to carry his 
dinner and his bed ; to litter his horse or camel; to dress his 
food; to draw his water; to light his fire, and to boil his mess 
of herbs ” (Hepworth Dixon, ‘The Holy Land”). 


8. Shepherds. Luke’s Gospel is the gospel of the poor and 
lowly. This revelation to the shepherds acquires additional 
meaning as we remember that shepherds, as a class, were under 
the Rabbinic ban, because of their necessary isolation from re- 
ligious ordinances, and their manner of life, which rendered 
strict legal observance wellnigh impossible. 


Keeping watch (duAdccovtes pudakas). Pvdaxy is some- 
times used of a watch as a measure of time, as in Matt. xiv. 
25: Mark vi. 48; Luke xii. 38. So possibly here. See Rev. 
in margin, night-watches. There is a play upon the words: 
watching watches. There was near Bethlehem, on the road to 
Jerusalem, a tower known as Migdal Eder, or the watch-tower 
of the flock. Were was the station where shepherds watched 
the flocks destined for sacrifice in the temple. Animals stray- 
ing from Jerusalem on any side, as far as from Jerusalem to 
Migdal Eder, were offered in sacrifice. It was a settled con- 
viction among the Jews that the Messiah was to be born in 
Bethlehem, and equally that he was to be revealed from Mig- 
dal Eder. The beautiful significance of the revelation of the 
infant Christ to shepherds watching the flocks destined for 
sacrifice needs no comment. 


Their flock (r%v moiuvnv). May not the singular number 
fall in with what has just been said?—the flock, the temple- 
flock, specially devoted to sacrifice. The pronoun thew would 
furnish no objection, since it is common to speak of the flock 
as belonging to the shepherd. Compare John x. 3, 4. 


9. Behold. Omitted by the best texts. 


270 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IL. 


The angel. More correctly an angel, as Rev. The Greek 
has no article. 


Came upon (ézéorn). The word is used in this sense in 
classical Greek, as well as in that of to stand by, which Rey. 
prefers here, as in Acts xii. 7. In ver. 38 of this chapter, Rev. 
renders coming up. The rendering to come upon has a hostile 
flavor, as properly in Acts xvii. 5, where the verb is rendered 
asswulted ; so that the Rev. rendering here is preferable. 

They were sore afraid. Lit., feared with great fear. 

10. | bring you good tidings of great joy (evayyerfouar

People (76 Aa@). Rev., rightly, “the people;” the article 
pointing specially to the people of Israel.

Wyc., heavenly knighthood. Tynd., heavenly soldiers.

14. Peace, good-will toward men (eipjvn év avIpwrois 
evooxia). Both Tischendorf and Westcott and Hort read evédo- 
klas, which the Rev. follows. According to this the rendering 
is, wnto men of good pleasure, or as Rev., among men in whom 
he is well pleased. Wyc., to men of good-will. For a similar 
construction, see Acts ix. 15; Col. i. 138. 


15. The shepherds. Some texts add oi av3pwrrot, the men ; 
but the later texts omit. 


Let us go (SéAJwpev). The preposition d:d, through, implies 
through the mtervening space. 


Thing (pjua). See on ch. i. 37. The utterance of the shep- 
herds contains a climax: “ Let us go and see this saying, which 
has come to pass ; which the Lord made known.”

dicates the discovery of the facts am succession. 


Mary and Joseph and the babe. Each has the article, 
pointing to the several parties already referred to. 


17. They made known. See on ver.8. These shepherds, 
having charge of flocks devoted to sacrifice, would presently be 
in the temple, and would meet those who came to worship and 
to sacrifice, and so proclaim the Messiah in the temple. 


19. Kept (cuverjper). See on the simple verb rnpéw, on 1 
Pet.i. 4. The word signifies not merely to guard, but to keep, 
as the result of guarding. Hence the compound verb is very 
expressive : kept, cv, with or within herself: closely. Note the 
imperfect tense : was heeping all the while. 


Pondered (cupBcrrovca). The present participle, ponder- 
ing. Lit., bringing together: comparing and weighing facts. 
Wyc., bearing together in her heart. Vulg., conferens. Com- 
pare Sophocles, “ Oedipus Coloneus,” 1472-4.

22. The days of her purification (ai judépas tod Kadaptopod 
airs). The A. V. follows the reading atrfs, her: but all the 
best texts read adrav, their; the plural including Joseph with 
Mary as partaking of the ceremonial defilement. The mother 
of a child was levitically unclean for forty days after the birth 
of a son, and for eighty days after the birth of a daughter. 
Women on this errand commonly rode to the temple on oxen ; 
that the body of so large a beast between them and the ground 
might prevent any chance of defilement from passing over a 
sepulchre on the road. For details, see Edersheim, “ Life and 
Times of Jesus,” i., 195 ; “ The Temple,” p. 302 ; Geikie, “ Life 
and Words of Christ,” i., 127. 


To present him to the Lord. The first-born son of every 
household must be redeemed of the priest at the price of five 
shekels of the sanctuary; about two dollars and fifty cents. 
Num. xviii. 15, 16; Exod. xiii. 2. 


23. The law of the Lord. The word daw occursin this chap- 
ter five times ; oftener than in all the rest of this Gospel put to- 
gether. Luke emphasizes the fact that Jesus “‘ was made under 
the law ” (Gal. iv. 4), and accordingly elaborates the details of the 
fulfilment of the law by the parents of both John and Jesus. 


24. A pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons. The 
offering of the poor. While the lamb would probably cost 
about one dollar and seventy-five cents, the doves would cost 
about sixteen cents. She would not bring the creatures them- 
selves, but would drop the price into one of the thirteen trum- 
pet-shaped chests in the Court of the Women. Young pigeons : 
lit., young ones of pigeons (voocods trepirrepav). Wyc. has 


culver-birds ; culver being an old English term for dove. So 
Spenser : 


‘More light than culver in the falcon’s fist.”

25. Devout (evAaBys). Used by Luke only. The kindred 
word, evAaBea, godly-fear, occurs twice: Heb. v. 7; xii. 28. 
From ed, well, and rNapwPave, to take hold of. Hence of a cir- 
cumspect or cautious person who takes hold of things carefully. 
As applied to morals and religion, it emphasizes the element of 
circumspection, a cautious, careful observance of divine law; 
and is thus peculiarly expressive of Old Testament piety, with its 
minute attention to precept and ceremony. Compare Acts ii. 5. 


Consolation of Israel. Compare hope of Israel, Acts xxviii. 
20, and Isa. xl. 1. The Messianic blessing of the nation. Of 
the Messiah himself, Rest. See Isa. xi. 10. A common form

26. It was revealed (jv xeypnuaticpévov). Lit., a was 
having been revealed ; i.e., it stood revealed, while he waited 
for the fulfilment of the revelation. The verb means primarily 
to have dealings with ; thence to consult or debate about busi- 
ness matters; and so of an oracle, to gwe a response to one 
consulting it. The word here implies that the revelation to 
Simeon had been given in answer to prayer. See on Matt. 
ii. 12. 


27. By the Spirit (€v 7@ mveduare). Lit., as Rev., “7m the 
Spirit:” the Holy Spirit prompting him. Indicating rather 
his spiritual condition, as one who walked with God, than a 
special divine impulse. 


After the custom (xara 70 eiJucpévor). Lit., according to 
that which was wont to be done. Only here in New Testament ; 
and the kindred words, &90s, custom, and é3w, to be accustomed, 
occur more frequently in Luke than elsewhere. Very common 
in medical writings. 


29. Lettest thou thy servant depart (azroAveis Tov SodAOV 
cov). Lit., thow dost release. The word is often used of manu- 
mitting or setting free on payment of ransom; and as Simeon 
uses the word for bond-servant, it is evident that his death is

In peace. Rev. properly puts this in its emphatic position 
at the end of the sentence. 


31. Of all people (wdvtwyv tév Aadv). The noun is plural, 
the peoples, and refers equally to the Gentiles. See Introduc- 
tion, on the universality of Luke’s Gospel. Wye., all peoples ; 
and so Rey. 


32. A light (dds). The light itself as distinguished from 
AUxves, @ lamp, which the A. V. often unfortunately renders 
light. See on Mark xiv. 54. 


To lighten (eis arroxdAvyuv). Wrong. Rev., correctly, for 
revelation. Wyc., to the shewing. It may be rendered the wn- 
veiling of the Gentiles. 


Gentiles (é9vév). Assigned to the same root as &9a, to be 
accustomed, and hence of a people bound together by like 
habits or customs. According to biblical usage the term is 
understood of people who are not of Israel, and who therefore 
occupy a different position with reference to the plan of salva- 
tion. Hence the extension of the gospel salvation to them is 
treated as a remarkable fact. See Matt. xii. 18, 21; xxiv. 14; 
xxvill. 19; Acts x. 45; xi. 18; xviii. 6. Paul is called distinctive- 
ly an apostle and teacher of the Gentiles, and a chosen vessel to 
bear Christ’s name among them. In Acts xv. 9; Eph. ii. 11, 
18; iil. 6, we see this difference annihilated, and the expression 
at last is merely historical designation of the non-Israelitish 
nations which, as such, were formerly without God and salva- 
tion. See Acts xv. 23; Rom. xvi. 4; Eph. iii. 1. Sometimes 
the word is used in a purely moral sense, to denote the heathen 
in opposition to Christians. See 1 Cor. v. 1; x. 20; 1 Pet. ii. 
12. Laght is promised here to the Gentiles and glory to Israel. 


Cu. IL] LUKE. 275 


The Gentiles are regarded as in darkness and ignorance. Some 
render the words eis aoxdduuv, above, for the unveiling of 
the Gentiles, instead of for revelation. Compare Isa. xxv. 7. 
Israel, however, has already received light by the revelation of 
God through the law and the prophets, and that light will 
expand into glory through Christ. Through the Messiah, 
Israel will attain its true and highest glory. 


33. And Joseph. The best texts read 6 wathp adrod, his 
Father. 


Marvelled (4v Javuatovtes). The Greek construction is 
peculiar. His father was and his mother wondering; the 
finite verb in the singular agreeing with the father, while the 
plural participle agrees with both. As usual, this combination 
of finite verb and participle denotes continuance or progression : 
they were marvelling while Simeon was speaking. So Rev. 


34. Them. The parents; the child being separately and 
specially designated. 


Is set (xetrar). The verb means primarily to be laid, and 
so to lie: hence to be set forth or promulgated, as the law is 
said to be laid down, and so, appointed or destined, as here. 


The fall and rising again (rrécw Kal avadctacw). For the 
fall, because he will be a stumbling-block to many (Isa. viii. 14; 
Matt. xxi. 42, 44; Acts iv.11; Rom. ix. 33; 1 Cor.i.23). For 
the rising, because many will be raised up through him to life 
and glory (Rom. vi. 4,9; Eph. ii. 6). The A. V. predicates 
the falling and the rising of the same persons: the fall and 
rising again of many. The Rey., the falling and rising up of 
many, is ambiguous. ‘The American Revisers give it correctly : 


the falling and the rising. 


Which shall be spoken against (dvtvAeyopuevov). The par- 
ticiple is the present; and the expression does not voice a 
prophecy, but describes an inherent characteristic of the sign:

a sign of which it is the character to experience contradiction 
from the world. In the beginning, as a babe, Jesus experienced 
this at the hands of Herod ; soall through his earthly ministry 
and on the cross; and so it will be to the end, until he shall 
have put all enemies under his feet. Compare Heb. xii. 3. 
Wyc., a token to whom it shall be gainsard.

37. Of about fourscore and four years (as érav dydonkov- 
ta tescdpov). The A. V. might be supposed to be stating 
her age; but the best texts read €ws, wntzl, instead of as, about ; 
and the statement refers to the time of her widowhood; a

to make a mutual agreement ; and the idea of reciprocity is 
retained in the expression “to return thanks” for something 
received. Compare Sept., Ps. Ixxix. 13.

or warrior (Isa. xxxi. 8). 


41. His parents. Though women were not bound to present 
themselves in person. 


49. Twelve years old. At which age he was known as a 
son of the law, and came under obligation to observe the ordi- 
nances personally. 


43. Had fulfilled the days. Not necessarily the whole 
seven days of the festival. With the third day commenced the 
so-called Aalf-holidays, when it was lawful to return home. 


44, The company (cvvodia). From ov, with, and 066s, the 
way. The company that shared the journey. 


Went aday’s journey. Before they missed him. 

They sought (dve{jrovv). From ava, from the bottom up, 
and fntéw, to seek. Thus implying a thorough search: they 
looked for him wp and down. 


45. Seeking him (dvafyrotvres). All the way as they went. 
Force of ava, as above. 


278 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. II. 


46. After three days. From the time of separation. 


Inthe temple. “We read in the Talmud that the mem- 
bers of the Temple-Sanhedrin, who, on ordinary days, sat as a 
court of appeal from the close of the morning to the time of 
the evening sacrifice, were wont, upon Sabbaths and feast-days, 
to come out upon the terrace of the temple, and there to teach. 
In such popular instruction the utmost latitude of questioning 
would be given. It is in this audience, which sat upon the 
ground, surrounding and mingling with the doctors, and hence 
during, not after, the feast, that we must seek the child Jesus” 
(Edersheim, “ Life and Times,” ete., i. 247 ). From this, Eders- 
heim argues that the parents set out for home before the close 
of the feast. 


Sitting. Not occupying a teacher’s place, but sitting in the 
circle among the doctors and their hearers. See above. Com- 
pare Acts xxii. 3. 


47. Understanding (cuvéces). From cuvinut, to bring to- 
gether. Hence that quality of mind which combines: under- 
standing not only of facts, but of facts in their mutual relations. 
See on Mark xii. 33; where there is meant “the love of a well- 
pondered and duly considered resolution which determines the 
whole person ; the love which clearly understands itself ” (Cre- 
mer). 


48. They were amazed (éferAdynoav). A very strong word ; 
the verb meaning, literally, to strike out or drive away from ; 
and so to drwe out of one’s senses. Hence in the general sense 
of great amazement. Amaze is to throw into a maze or lab- 
yrinth ; and so is closely akin to the Greek word here, and is 
a faithful rendering. 


Son (réxvov). Lit., child. See on Matt. i. 1. 


Thy father. “Up to this time Joseph had been so called 
by the holy child himself ; but from this time never” (Alford).

Mary is going over in mind the process of the search. 


49. And he said. The first saying of Jesus which is pre- 
served to us. 


Must (S¢7). Lit., 2¢ 2s necessary, or tt behoves. A word often 
used by Jesus concerning his own appointed work, and express- 
ing both the inevitable fulfilment of the divine counsels and the 
absolute constraint of the principle of duty upon himself. See 
Matt. xvi. 21; xxvi. 54; Mark viii. 31; Luke iv. 48; ix. 22; 
xiii. 83; xxiv. 7,26, 46; John iii. 14; iv. 4; xi. 34. 


About my Father’s business (év Tots tod matpos). Lit., in 
the things of my Father. The words will bear this rendering ; 
but the Rev. is better, a my Father’s house. Mary’s question 
was not as to what her son had been doing, but as to where he 
had been. Jesus, in effect, answers, “‘ Where is a child to be 
found but in his Father’s house ?” 


50. The saying (70 pha). See on ch. i. 37. 


51. Was subject (fv totaccopevos). The participle and 
finite verb, denoting habitual, continuous subjection. “ Even be- 
fore, he had been subject to them; but this is mentioned now, 
when it might seem that he could by this time have exempted 
himself. Not even to the angels fell such an honor as to the 
parents of Jesus” (Bengel). Compare Heb. i. 4-8. 


Kept (Sverjper). Only here and Acts xv. 29. The preposi- 
tion bid, through, indicates close, faithful, persistent keeping, 
through all the circumstances which might have weakened the 
impression of the events. Compare Gen. xxxvii. 11. 


52. Stature (jduia). Which Rev. rightly retains. The 
word may be rendered age, which would be superfluous here.

5. Valley (ddpayé). Strictly, of a chasm or ravine in a

Shall be filled—brought low. In allusion to the practice 
of Eastern monarchs. On occasions of their progress, heralds 
were sent out to call on the people to clear and improve the 
old roads or to make new ones. ‘When Ibrahim Pacha pro- 
posed to visit certain places in Lebanon, the emirs and sheiks 
sent forth a general proclamation, somewhat in the style of 
Isaiah’s exhortation, to all the inhabitants to assemble along the 
proposed route and prepare the way before him. The same 
was done in 1845, on a grand scale, when the Sultan visited 
Brusa. The stones were gathered out, the crooked places 
straightened, and rough ones made level and smooth. I had 
the benefit of these labors a few days after his majesty’s visit. 
The exhortation ‘to gather out the stones’ (Isa. lxii. 10) is 
peculiarly appropriate. These farmers do the exact reverse— 
gather up the stones from their fields and cast them into the 
highway; and it is this barbarous custom which, in many 
places, renders the paths uncomfortable and even dangerous” 
(Thomson, “ Land and Book”). 


7. He said (édeyev) to the multitudes that came forth 
(€xmropevopévors). The use of the tenses is graphic. He said, 
the imperfect, and came forth, the present participle; both de- 
noting action in progress, or customary action; so that the sense 
is, he kept saying, or he used to say to those who were coming 
out, to the crowds of people which kept pouring out successively. 
Compare é£emropevero, went out, also imperfect, Matt. iti. 5. 
Luke gives the substance of the Baptist’s preaching summarily. 


Generation (yevvjyara). Lit., births. Rev., better, off- 
spring. It has been observed that John’s figurative language is 
altogether the language of the desert. Notice the succession of 
images: Brood of vipers; fruits (of repentance); the axe at 
the root of the tree ; the slave-boy loosing or bearing the sandals ; 
the baptism of fire ; the winnowing-fan, the threshing-floor, the 
garner, and the burning of the chaff.

Warned (iméde£ev). From tio, under, and deixvups, to shew. 
Hence, literally, to shew secretly. The word implies a private 
or confidential hint or reminder. Compare ch. xii. 5; Acts 
1x1 Gs) xXxXnoDs 


8. Fruits («apzrovs) Matthew has the singular number, 
Kaprrov, frutt. 


Repentance (ris petavoias). Note the article: the repent- 
ance which you profess in coming to my baptism. Rev., in 
margin, “ your repentance.” See on Matt. iii. 2. 


Begin. With the first accusing of your conscience. “ He 
anticipates even attempt at excuse” (Bengel). Matthew has 
think not, indicating a delusive fancy. 


Father. The word stands first in the sentence, ‘“ We have 
Abraham to our father,” and is therefore emphatic, and with 
reason; for it was on their descent that the answer of these 
Jews to John’s rebuke turned: “ Our father is Abraham.” 


These stones. See on Matt. ili. 9.

quent repetition of these questions. 


11. Coats (yitdvas). See on Matt. v. 40. 


11. Publicans (reA@vac). From réXos, a tax, and @véopat, to 
buy. The collectors of Roman imposts. The Romans farmed 
out the direct taxes and customs-duties to capitalists, on their 
payment of a certain sum im publicum, into the public treasury, 
whence they were called publicani, publicans. Sometimes this 
sum, being greater than any one person could pay, was paid by 
acompany. Under these were the submagistri, living in the 
provinces; and under these again the portitores, or actual cus- 


Cu. IIL] LUKE. 283 


tom-house officers, who are referred to by the term teAdvaw in 
the New Testament. They were often chosen from the dregs 
of the people, and were sv notorious for their extortions that they 
were habitually included in the same category with harlots and 
sinners. “Tf a Jew could scarcely persuade himself that it was 
right to pay taxes, how much more heinous a crime must it 
have been in his eyes to become the questionably honest instru- 
ment for collecting them. If a publican was hated, how still 
more intense must have been the disgust entertained against a 
publican who was also a Jew ” (Farrar, “Life of Christ ”). The 
word “ publican,” as a popular term of reproach, was used even 
by our Lord (Matt. xviii. 17). Even the Gentiles despised 
them. Farrar cites a Greek saying, “ All publicans are rob- 
bers.” 


13. Exact (zpdocere). The change of the Rev. to extort is 
unfortunate. The word is used of the exaction of legal tribute, 
and eacesswe exaction is expressed by the following words: 
John would hardly have commanded them to extort in any case. 


14. Soldiers (ctpatevépevor). Strictly, soldiers on services 
hence the participle, serving as soldiers, instead of the more 
comprehensive term orpatidrar, soldiers by profession. Some 
explain it of soldiers engaged in police inspection in connection 
with the customs, and hence naturally associated with the pub- 
licans. 


What shall we do? The wein the Greek is emphatic, 
closing the question. Hence Rev., very aptly, and we, what 
must we do ? 


Do violence (d:ace/cnte). Only here in New Testament. 
Lit., to shake violently ; hence to agitate or terrify ; and so to 
extort money from one by terrifying him. The corresponding 
Latin word concutere is used by later writers in the same sense. 
Xenophon says of Socrates: “I know of his once having heard 
from Crito that life at Athens was a hard thing for a man who 
desired to mind his own business. ‘For,’ said he, ‘ they bring 


284 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. III. 


actions against me, not because they are wronged by me, but 
because they think I would rather pay money than have any 
trouble’” (“ Memorabilia,” ii., 9,1). For this process of black- 
mail, cetw, to shake, was used. Thus Aristophanes (“ Knights,” 
840) : 


‘Thou shalt make much money by falsely accusing and frightening” (celwy Te 
kar Tapdr Tov). 


And again (“ Peace,” 639) : 
‘‘ And of their allies they falsely accused (2cciov) the substantial and rich.” 


The word in this passage of Luke has the later, secondary 
meaning, to extort ; and therefore the American Revisers rightly 
insist on, extort from no man by violence. It is used by medical 
writers, as, for instance, by Hippocrates, of shaking the palsied 
or benumbed limbs of a patient ; or of a shaking by which the 
liver was relieved of an obstruction. Luke also uses two other 
compounds of the verb celw: katacelw, to beckon, Acts xii. 1 
(peculiar to Luke) ; and avacéie, to stir wp, which occurs also 
in Mark xv. 11. Both these are also used by medical writers. 


Accuse any falsely (cveofavtjonte). The common ex- 
planation of this word is based on the derivation from cixov, & 
fig, and paiva, to make known ; hence of informing against 
persons who exported figs from Attica, contrary to the law, or 
who plundered sacred fig-trees. As informers were tempted to 
accuse innocent persons by the reward paid for pointing out 
violators of the law, the verb acquired the meaning to accuse 
falsely. Such is the old explanation, which is now rejected by 
scholars, though the real explanation is merely conjectural. 
The fig-tree was the pride of Attica, ranking with honey and 
olives as one of the principal products, and there is no authority 
for the statement that there was a time when figs were scarce, 
and required legal protection against export. Neither is it 
proven that there was a sacred kind of fig. Rettig, in an in- 
teresting paper in the “ Studien und Kritiken ” (1838), explains 
that, as tribute in Attica was paid in kid as well as in money, 


Cu. 1.) LUKE. 285 


and as figs represented a great deal of property, there was a 
temptation to make false returns of the amount of figs to the 
assessors ; and that thus a class of informers arose who detected 
and reported these false returns, and received a percentage of 
the fine which was imposed. These were known as jfig-shewers. 
Another writer has suggested that the reference is to one who 
brings figs to light by shaking the tree ; and so, metaphorically, 
to one who makes rich men yield up the fruits of their labor or 
rascality by false accusation. Whatever explanation we may 
accept, it is evident that the word had some original connection 
with jigs, and that it came to mean to slander or accuse falsely. 
From it comes our word sycophant. The sycophants as a class 
were encouraged at Athens, and their services were rewarded. 
Socrates is said by Xenophon to have advised Crito to take a 
sycophant into his pay, in order to thwart another who was 
annoying him ; and this person, says Xenophon, “quickly dis- 
covered on the part of Crito’s accusers many illegal acts, and 
many persons who were enemies to those accusers; one of 
whom he summoned to a public trial, in which it would be 
settled what he should suffer or pay, and he would not let him 
off until he ceased to molest Crito and paid a sum of money 
besides.” Demosthenes thus describes one: “ He glides about 
the market like a scorpion, with his venomous sting all ready, 
spying out whom he may surprise with misfortune and ruin, 
and from whom he can most easily extort money, by threaten- 
ing him with an action dangerous in its consequences. 

It is the bane of our city that it protects and cherishes Me 
poisonous brood, and uses them as informers, so that even the 
honest man must flatter and court them, in order to be safe 
from their machinations.” The word occurs only here and ch. 
xix. 8, of Zacchaeus, the publican. The American Revisers 
hold to the A. V., and render neither accuse any one wrongfully, 
extortion being described by the previous word. Wye., neether 
make ye false challenge. In the Sept. it is used in the sense of 
to oppress or decewe. 


Wages (dyevios). From dor, cooked meat, and later, gener- 
ally, provisions. At Athens, especially, fish. Compare dydpvor, 
Jish, John xxi. 9,10, 18. Hence oyrewovr is primarily provision- 


286 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca. IM. 


money, and so used of supplies and pay foran army. With this 
understanding the use of the word at Rom. vi. 23, “ the wages 
of sin,” becomes highly suggestive. 


15. Mused (dvaroy:fouévov). Better as Rev., reasoned. Com- 
pare ch. i. 29; and see on Jas. ii. 4. 


16. One mightier (0 icyuporepos). The definite article points 
to an expected personage... Hence better as Rev., he that is 
mightier. 


Unloose (Adcaz). So also Mark; but Matthew Bacrdaca, 
to bear. See on Matt. iii. 11. 


17. Fan—floor—purge. See on Matt. iii. 12. 
18. Other (étepa). Rather, various, different. 


Preached (evnyyedigero). Rev. preserves the fuller meaning 
of the word according to its etymology : preached good tidings. 
See on Gospel, Superscription of Matthew. 


19, 20. Compare Matt. xiv. 3-5; Mark vi. 17-20. 
19. Being reproved (€Aeyyouevos). See on Jas. il. 9. 


Evils (zrovnpov). Of several words in the New Testament 
denoting evil, this emphasizes evil in its activity. Hence Satan 
is 6 wovnpos, the evil one. An evil eye (Mark vii. 22) is a més- 
chief-working eye. See on Mark vii. 22. ° 


Added (apocédnxev). Used by Luke twice as often as in all 
the rest of the New Testament. A very common medical word, 
used of the application of remedies to the body, as our apply, 
administer. So Hippocrates, “ apply wet sponges to the head ; ” 
and Galen, ‘apply a decoction of acorns,” etc. 


In prison. See on Matt. xiv. 3.

23. Began to be about thirty years of age (4v dpydpevos

should be as Rev., when he began (to teach) was about thirty 


years of age. 


CHAPTER IV. 
1-13. Compare Matt. iv. 1-11; Mark i. 12-13. 


1. Was led. So Matthew. Mark says, “ The Spirit driveth,

By the Spirit (€v 76 rvevpuate). The American Revisers ren- 
der zm the spirit, indicating the sphere rather than the impulse 
of his action. 


Into the wilderness. The A. V. has followed the reading 
eis, into. The proper reading is év, in. He was not only im- 
pelled into the wilderness, but guided in the wilderness by the 
Spirit. 


2. Forty days. This should be joined with the preceding 
words, indicating the duration of his stay in the wilderness, not 
of his temptation, as A. V., being forty days tempted. Read as 
Rev., in the wilderness during forty days.

12. It is said. For Matthew’s 7 zs written, Matt. iv. 7. 
Luke omits Matthew’s again. See Matt. iv. 7. 


13. Had ended allthetemptation. Peculiarto Luke. The 
verb cuvtedécas, from avy, together, and Tedéw, to accomplish, 
means to bring to one end together; hence to bring to an end 
utterly. Better therefore as Rev., completed. The temptations 
formed a complete cycle, so that it could afterward be said of 
Jesus that “he was im all points tried like as we are” (Heb. 
iv. 15). 


All the temptation (aavra teipacpov). Incorrect. Rev., 
rightly, every temptation. So Wyc., Kuery temptation ended. 


For a season (aype xacpod). Peculiar to Luke. More strictly, 
until a convenient time ; since Satan meant to assail him again, 
as he did in the person of Peter (Mark viii. 38); by the Phari- 
sees (John viii. 40 sq.); and at Gethsemane. See ch. xxii. 53.

290 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IV. 


To read (dvayvévat). Usually in New Testament of public 
reading.* After the liturgical services which introduced the 
worship of the synagogue, the “minister” took a roll of the law 
from the ark, removed its case and wrappings, and then called 
upon some one to read. On the Sabbaths, at least seven persons 
were called on successively to read portions of the law, none of 
them consisting of less than three verses. After the law fol- 
lowed a section from the prophets, which was succeeded imme- 
diately by a discourse. It was this section which Jesus read 
and expounded. See Acts xiii. 15; Neh. viii. 5, 8. For a de- 
tailed account of the synagogue-worship, see Edersheim, “ Life 
and Times of Jesus,” i., 480 sq. 


17. The book (@:8rov). A diminutive of BiBros, the inner 
bark of the papyrus, used for writing. Hence a roll. The 
word is also used to denote a division of a work, and is there- 
fore appropriate here to mark the writings of a single prophet 
as related to the whole body of the prophetic writings. 


Opened (avarrvéas). Lit., wnrolled. Both this and the 
simple verb 1tvcca, to close (ver. 30), occur only once in the 
New Testament. The former word was used in medical lan- 
guage of the opening out of various parts of the body, and the 
latter of the rolling up of bandages. The use of these terms 
by Luke the physician is the more significant from the fact that 
elsewhere in the New Testament évotyw is used for the opening 
of a book (Apoc. v. 2-5; x. 2, 8; xx. 12); and eidlcow, for 
rolling i up (Apoe. vi. 14). 


Found. As if by chance: reading at the place where the 
roll opened of itself, and trusting to divine guidance. 


Was written (jv yeypaupévov). Lit., was having been 
written ; i.e., stood written. 


18. Anointed. See on Christ, Matt. i. 1. 


To preach good tidings. See on Gospel, Superscription 
of Matthew.

To heal the broken-hearted. The best texts omit. So

To preach («npvéar). Better as Rev., proclaim, as a herald. 
See on 2 Pet. ii. 5. 


To the captives (aiywaroros). From aiypn, a spear-pomnt, 
and daricKopuat, to be taken or conquered. Hence, properly, of 
prisoners of war. Compare Isa. xlii.7: “To bring out captives 
from the prison, and those who sit in darkness from the house of 
restraint.” The allusion is to Israel, both as captive exiles and 
as prisoners of Satan in spiritual bondage. Wye. has caytefs, 
which formerly signified captives. 


To set at liberty (arocteiAas) Lit., to send away in dis- 
charge. Inserted from the Sept. of Isa. viii. 6. See on ch. iii. 
3, and Jas. v. 15. 


Them that are bruised (re3pavopévous). Lit., broken in 
preces. Only here in New Testament. Wyc., to delwwer broken 
men into remission. The same Hebrew word is used in Isa. 
xlii. 3: “a crushed reed shall he not break,” which the Sep- 
tuagint translates by te9Xacpévov, a word which does not occur 
in the New Testament. In the citation of this latter passage 
(Matt. xii. 20, on which see) the word for bruised is cvvtpiBa, 
which the Septuagint uses for break. 


19. To preach (Rev., proclaim) the acceptable year of 
the Lord. As on the first day of the year of Jubilee, when 
the priests went through the land proclaiming, with sound of 
trumpet, the blessings of the opening year (Lev. xxv. 8-17). 
Note ver. 10, where liberty is to be proclaimed to all in that 
year. Wyc., the year of the Lord pleasant. A literal interpre- 
tation of the word year gave rise among some of the Christian 
fathers to the theory that our Lord’s ministry lasted but a single 
year.

to the president of the congregation, who, as the teaching elder, 
would have addressed the people if Jesus had not done so. It 
means the attendant who had charge of the sacred rolls. He 
was a salaried officer, a kind of chapel-clerk. 


Sat down. As about to teach; that being the habitual 
position of a Jewish teacher. 


Were fastened (7jcav atevifovres). The participle and finite 
verb denoting continuous, steadfast attention. The verb, from 
teva, to stretch, denotes fixed attention. Indeed, the word 
attention itself, etymologically considered, conveys the same 
idea. 


21. He began. Not necessarily denoting his first words, but 
indicating a solemn and weighty opening. 

22. Bare him witness. Compare ver. 14. They confirmed 
the reports which had been circulated about him. Note the 
imperfect tense. There was a continuous stream of admiring 
comment. Similarly, were wondering. 


At the gracious words (Adyous tis ydputos). Literally and 
correctly, as Rev., words of grace. See on ch. i. 80. 


Is not (ody). Expecting an affirmative answer. 
23. Surely (wdvytaws). Lit., by all means. Rev., doubtless. 


Proverb (zrapaBoanv). Rev., parable. See on Matt. xiii. 3 
Wyc., lekeness. 


Physician, heal thyself. A saying which Luke alone re- 
cords, and which would forcibly appeal to him as a physician. 


Cx. IV.] LUKE. 293 


Galen speaks of a physician who should have cured himself 
before he attempted to attend patients. The same appeal was 
addressed to Christ on the cross (Matt. xxvii. 40, 42). 


25. A great famine was throughout all the land (éyévero 
Aypos wéyas el Tacav THY yhv). More literally and correctly, 
as Rey., there came (or arose) a great famine over all the land. 


27. Lepers. Wye. renders meselis, the middle-English word 
for a leper, and derived from msellus, a diminutive of the 
Latin miser, wretched. 


29. The brow (ddpvos). Only here in New Testament. 
Wyc., cope, which is originally cap or hood. The word is used 
in medical language both of the eyebrows and of other pro- 
jections of the body. It would naturally occur to a physician, 
especially since the same epithets were applied to the appear- 
ance of the eyebrows in certain diseases as were applied to Azlls. 
Thus Hippocrates, describing a deadly fever, says, “ The eye- 
brows seem to hang over,” the same word which Homer uses 
of arock. So Aretaeus, describing the appearance of the eye- 
brows in elephantiasis, depicts them as mpoBdjres, projecting, 
and oyIadeus, ike mounds. Stanley says: “ Most readers prob- 
ably from these words imagine a town built on the summit of a 
mountain, from which summit the intended precipitation was 
to take place. This is not the situation of Nazareth; yet its 
position is still in accordance with the narrative. It is built 
upon, that is, on the side of a mountain, but the brow is not 
beneath, but over the town, and such a cliff asis here implied is 
found in the abrupt face of a limestone rock about thirty or 
forty feet high, overhanging the Maronite convent at the south- 
west corner of the town ” (“Sinai and Palestine ”). 


Cast him down headlong (xataxpnyvica). Only here in 
New Testament, and in the Septuagint only in 2 Chron. xxv. 12. 


31-37. Compare Mark i, 21-28. 


294 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IV. 


31. Taught (jv diddcxwv). Correctly, as Rev., was teaching. 
The finite verb and participle denoting continuance. 


On the Sabbath-days (rots cdB8Bacw). Rev., day. The 
word is often used in the plural form for the single day, as in 
ver. 16; probably after the analogy of plural names of festi- 
vals, as 7a dtupua, the feast of unleavened bread ; Ta yevéota, the 
birth-day ; or perhaps following the Aramaic plural. 


32. They were astonished (é£erAnoocovto). See on Matt. 
vil. 28. 


33. A spirit of an unclean devil. Where the rendering 
should be demon. This is the only case in which Luke adds to 
that word the epithet wnclean. 


34. What have we to do with thee (rt iv Kai cot)? Lit., 
what is there to us and to thee ? 2.e., what have we in common ? 
So Wyc. 


35. Hold thy peace (diueInre). Lit., be muzzled or gagged. 
See on Matt. xxii. 12. 


Had thrown (pzyav). Used in connection with disease by 
Luke only, and only here. In medical language, of convulsions, 
fits, etc. 


Hurt him not (udev Brayray adrov). Lit., im no possible 
way. Mark omits this detail, which a physician would be care- 
ful to note. Brdmrew, to eure, occurs but twice in New 
Testament—here and Mark xvi. 18. It is common in medical 
language, opposed to wdereiv, to benefit, as of medicines or diet 
hurting or benefiting. 


36. They were all amazed (éyévero SauBos émli mavtas). 
Lit., as Rev., amazement came upon all. OdpBos, amazement, 
is used by Luke only. The kindred verb, SauBéouat, to be 
amazed, occurs only once in Luke (Acts ix. 6), and three times 
in Mark ; while Mark alone has the strong compound é«JayuPéa, 
to be greatly amazed (Mark ix. 15). 


Cu. IV.] LUKE. 295 


37. The fame (%yos). Lit., novse. Rev., rwmor. Only 
here, ch. xxi. 25, where the correct reading is #yous, the roaring, 
and Actsii.2. Heb. xii. 19 is a quotation from the Septuagint. 
It is the word used in Acts ii. 2 of the mighty rushing wind at 
Pentecost. Mark uses d«o7, in its earlier sense of a report. 
The same word occurs in Luke, but always in the sense in 
which medical writers employed it—hearing or the cars. See 
ch. vil. 1; Acts xvii. 20; xxviii. 26. "Hyos was the medical 
term for sound in the ears or head. Hippocrates uses both 
words together: “the ears (axoal) are full of sound (jyov) ;” 
and Aretaeus of the noise of the sea, as Luke xxi. 25. 


38-41. Compare Matt. viii. 14-17; Mark i. 29-34, 


38. Taken (cuveyouévn). Rev., holden. So Wyc. See on 
Matt. iv. 24. The word is used nine times by Luke, and only 
three times elsewhere. Paul uses it of the constraining of 
Christ’s love (2 Cor. v. 14), and of being wa strait (Philip. i. 
23). In Acts xxviii. 8, it is joined with fever, as here, and is a 
common medical term in the same sense. 


A great fever (aupert® peyddo). Another mark of the 
physician. The epithet great is peculiar to Luke. The ancient 
physicians distinguished fevers into great and small. 


39. He stood over her. Asaphysicianmightdo. Peculiar 
to Luke. 


Rebuked. Peculiar to Luke. 
40. When the sun was setting. The people brought their 
sick at that hour, not only because of the coolness, but because 


it was the end of the Sabbath, and carrying a sick person was 
regarded as work. See John v. 10. 


Diseases (vocows). See on Matt. iv. 23. Wye. Sick men 
with divers languishings. 


Laid his hands on. Peculiar to Luke. 


296 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. V. 


Every one. “Implying the solicitude and indefatigableness 
of this miraculous ministry of love ” (Meyer). 


41. Crying out (xpavydfovra). The inarticulate demoniac 
scream. 


Saying. The articulate utterance. 

Mr. Hobart (“Medical Language of St. Luke”) remarks that 
the medical bias of Luke may be seen from the words he ab- 
stains from using as well as from those he does use in respect 
of disease. Thus he never uses padaxia for sickness, as Matthew 
does (iv. 28; ix. 35; x. 1), since this word is never so used in 
medical language, but is confined to the meaning of delicacy, 
effeminacy. So, too, he never uses Bacavifew, to torment, of 
sickness, as Matthew does (viii. 6), as it is never so used in 
medical language, the word there meaning to examine some 
part of the body or some medical question. 


42-44, Compare Mark i. 35-39. 


42. Sought after (érefjrovv). Imperfect tense: were seek- 
ang. 


Came unto him (jAJov &ws avdtod). Stronger than came 
to; for ws is even up to, showing that they did not discontinue 
their search until they found him. Mark’s narrative here is 
fuller and more graphic. 


CHAPTER V. 
1-11. Compare Matt. iv. 18-22; Mark i. 16-20. 
1. Pressed (ézixeiodar). Lit., were laid upon. 
To hear. The A. V. is correct according to the reading 


tod axovew, which it follows. The true reading is cal axoveww, 
and heard. So Rey. 


Cx. V.] LUKE. 297 


He stood (avros mv éoras). The pronoun distinguishes 
him from the crowd which pressed upon him: he on hes part 
stood. Render the participle and finite verb as Rev., was 
standing. 


Lake (Aduvnv). An illustration of the more classical style 
of Luke as compared with Matthew and Mark. They and John 
also use SdXacca, sea. See on Matt. iv. 18. 


2. Ships (dota). Used of vessels in general. Some texts 
read odpia, a diminutive form, meaning Jitdle boats. 


Were washing. From the sand and pebbles accumulated 
during the night’s work. Luke uses four different words for 
washing or cleansing: 7Avve, here, see also Apoc. vii. 14 ; aTro- 
pdoow, of wiping the dust from the feet, only at ch. x. 11; 
éxudoow, of the woman wiping Christ’s feet with her hair, 
ch. vii. 38, 44; dsrodovw, of washing away sins, Acts xxii. 16; 
Aovw, of washing the prisoners’ stripes and the body of Dorcas, 
Acts xvi. 33; ix. 37. The reading drom)tvo is rejected by the 
best texts, so that daroudocw is the only one peculiar to Luke. 
All the words were common in medical language. 


3. Thrust out (éravayayeiv). Rev., put out. The special 
nautical word for putting out to sea. 


Taught (és/Sacxev). The imperfect. He continued the 
teaching he had begun on the shore. 


4. Launch out. Reyv., put out. The singular number, ad- 
dressed to Peter as master of the craft. 


Let down (yaddoarte). The plural, addressed to the whole 
of the boat’s crew. Originally, to slacken or loosen, as a bow- 
string or the reins of horses; hence to let sink asanet. Also 
of unbarring adoor. Metaphorically, to be indulgent, to pardon. 
The word occurs in the New Testament seven times, and five of 
these in Luke. He uses it of letting down Paul in a basket at 


298 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. V. 


Damascus (Acts ix. 25); of striking a ship’s sails, and of letting 
down a boat into the sea (Acts xxvii. 17, 30). Matthew, Mark, 
and John use Baro or audiBdrro, for casting a net (Matt. iv. 
18; xiii. 47; Mark i. 16; John xxi. 6), which appears also in 
the compound noun for a casting-net (aupiBrnotpov, see on 
Matt. iv. 18). The word used by Luke was in common use in 
medical writings, to denote relaxation of the limbs ; loosening 
of bandages; abatement of sickness ; letting herbs down into 
a vessel to be steeped. 


5. Master (éricrdta). Used by Luke only, and always with 
reference to Jesus. He never uses Rabdi, as John especially. 
Wye., commander. 


Toiled (xomudcavres). From xotros, suffering, wearmess ; 
and therefore indicating exhausting toil. 


At thy word (ew). Relying on: on the ground of. 


The net (dé«7vov). A general term for a net, whether for 
fish or fowl. See on Matt. iv. 18. Some, as Rev., read ra d:x- 
tua, the nets. 


Brake (dveppnyvuto). Some texts read dvepyjooeto, from the 
later form of the verb. The difference is unimportant. The 
A. V. fails to give the force of the imperfect, were breaking, as 
Rev.; or even better, possibly, began to break. Trench suggests 
were atthe point to break. The word occurs also at ch. viii. 29 ; 
Acts xiv. 14, and only twice beside in the New Testament. Luke 
alone uses the two compounds srepippryyvups, of rending off 
clothes (Acts xvi. 22), and wrpocpyyvupn, to beat violently (ch. vi. 
48, 49). See on those passages. All the words occur in medi- 
cal writings. 


7. They beckoned (carévevoav). The word originally means 
to nod assent, and so, generally, to make a sign. They made 
signs because of the distance of the other boat; hardly, as 
has been suggested, because they were too much amazed to 
speak. 


Cu. V.J LUKE. 299 


Help (cvAraBéoda:). Lit., take hold with. Compare Philip. 
Wii S 


Began to sink (Svdifec3ar). Only here and 1 Tim. vi. 9, 
of drowning men in destruction. From Budds, the depth. 
Wyce., they were almost drenched. 


8. Fell down at Jesus’ knees. Compare Sophocles, “ Oedi- 
pus at Colonus,” 1605: 


‘* Zeus from the dark depths thundered, and the girls 
Heard it, and shuddering, at their father’s knees 
Falling, they wept.” 


9. He was astonished (3du8os meprécyev avtov).  Lit., 
amazement encompassed him. See on 1 Pet. ii. 6. 


The draught (79 dypa). The word is used both of the act of 
catching and of that which is caught. In ver. 4 it has the former 
sense: “let down your net for catching :” here, the latter, the 
catch or haul. 


10. Partners (xowwvol). In ver. 7 the word rendered part- 
ners is wétoxyot; from perd, with, and éxyw, to have. The word 
here denotes a closer association, a common interest. The kin- 
dred noun, kowwvia, fellowship, is used of the fellowship of be- 
lievers with Christ (1 Cor. i. 9); the communion of the body 
and blood of Christ (1 Cor. x. 16); the communion of the Holy 
Ghost (2 Cor. xiii. 14). The persons referred to in ver. 7 might 
have been only hired workmen (Mark i. 20), temporarily asso- 
ciated with the principals. 


Thou shalt catch (éo7n Cwypav). Lit., thow shalt be catching, 
the participle and finite verb denoting that this is to be his ha- 
bitual calling. Both Matthew and Mark make the promise to be 
addressed to Peter and his companions; Luke to Peter alone. 
The verb fwypéo, to catch, is compounded of fads, diving, and 
aypeva, to catch or take. Hence, lit., to take alive: in war, to 


300 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. V. 


take captive, instead of killing. Thus Homer, when Menelaus 
threatens the prostrate Adrastus: 


“¢ Adrastus clasped the warrior’s knees and said, 
O son of Atreus, take me prisoner” (Céypet). 
Itiad, vi., 45, 6; compare Itiad, x., 378. 


So Herodotus: “The Persians took Sardis, and captured 
Croesus himself alive ” (€Saypncav).—l., 86. 

There is certainly a reason for the use of this term, as indi- 
cating that Christ’s ministers are called to win men ¢o life. 
Compare 2 Tim. ii. 26, where, according to the best supported 
rendering, the servant of God is represented as taking men alive 
out of the power of Satan, to be preserved unto the will of God ; 
Z.e., a8 instruments of his will (compare A. V. and Rev.). The 
word thus contains in itself an answer to the sneering remark 
of the Apostate Julian, that Christ aptly termed his apostles 
Jishers ; “for, as the fisherman draws out the fish from waters 
where they were free and happy, to an element in which they 
cannot breathe, but must presently perish, so did these.” 


12-16. Compare Matt. viii. 2-4; Mark i. 40-45. 


12. Full of leprosy. Matthew and Mark have simply a 
leper. The expression, full of leprosy, seems to be used here 
with professional accuracy. Leprosy was known among physi- 
cians under three forms: the dull white, the clear white, and 
the black. Luke means to describe an aggravated case. The 
word full in this connection is often used by medical writers, 
as, full of desease ; the veins full of blood ; the ears full of 


roaring. 


Make me clean (xaJapica:). All three evangelists say 
cleanse instead of heal, because of the notion of uncleanness 
which specially attached to this malady. 


13. I will (9ér). See on Matt. i. 19. 


Be thou clean (xa9apiodntu). Rev., more accurately, gives 
the force of the passive voice, be thou made clean. 


Cu. V.] LUKE. 801 


14. He charged (mapnyyeircv). A strong word, often of 
military orders. Aristotle uses it of a physician: to prescribe. 
Mark has éuBpiypnodpevos, strictly or sternly charged. See on 
Mark i. 48. 


No one (unoevi). The conditional negative: no one that he 
might chance to meet. 


Go, shew thyself. A lively change from the narrative to 
direct address. 


15. Went abroad (dujpyero). Aa, throughout the region. 
Wyc., the word walked about. 


Came together (cuvjpyovro). Imperfect. Kept coming 
together, or were coming. 


To be healed (Separreveo3ar). Originally, to be an attend- 
ant, to do service ; and therefore of a physician, to attend upon, 
or treat medically. In classical writers it has also the mean- 
ing to heal, as undoubtedly in the New Testament, and in Luke 
(xiii. 14; Acts iv. 14, etc.). See on Matt. viii. 7, and compare 
idopat, to heal, in ver. 17. 


Infirmities (a4c9everv). A strictly literal rendering ; a, not, 
and oévos, strength, exactly answering to the Latin 2m, not, and 


jurmus, strong. 


16. Withdrew (jv iroywpav). The participle with the imper- 
fect of the finite verb denoting something in progress, and thus 
corresponding to the imperfect in ver. 15. The multitudes 
were coming together, but he was engaged wm retirement and 
prayer, so that he was inaccessible. The word occurs only in 
Luke, the usual New Testament word for withdraw being ava- 
yopéw. See Matt. ii. 12; xii 15; Mark iii. 7. 


17-26. Compare Mark ii. 1-12. 


302 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. V. 


17. He wasteaching. The pronoun has aslightly emphatic 
force: he as distinguished from the Pharisees and teachers of 
the law. 


Doctors of the law (vouodivdoKarol). Only in Luke and 
1 Tim. i. 7. Luke often uses vopixds, conversant with the law, 
but in the other word the element of teaching is emphasized, 
probably in intentional contrast with Christ’s teaching. 


Judaea and Jerusalem. The Rabbinical writers divided 
Judaea proper into three parts—mountain, sea-shore, and valley 
—Jerusalem being regarded as a separate district. ‘‘ Only one 
intimately acquainted with the state of matters at the time, 
would, with the Rabbis, have distinguished Jerusalem as a dis- 
trict separate from all the rest of Judaea, as Luke markedly 
does on several occasions (Acts i. 8; x. 39)” (Edersheim, “ Jew- 
ish Social Life”). 


Was present to heal them. The A. V. follows the read- 
ing, avtovs, them ,; 1.¢., the sufferers who were present, referring 
back to ver. 15. The best texts, however, read avrov, him, 
referring to Christ, and meaning was present that he should 
heal ; i.e., in aid of his healing. So Rey. 


18. Taken with a palsy (vapadedupmévos). Rey., more 
neatly, palsted. Whenever Luke mentions this disease, he 
uses the verb and not the adjective wapadvutixds, paralytic 
(as Matt. iv. 24; viii. 6; Mark ii. 3-10; compare Acts viii. 
7; ix. 38); his usage in this respect being in strict accord 
with that of medical writers. 


19. Tiles. Wye. has sclattis, slates. 


Couch (xruwidim). Luke uses four words for the beds of the 
sick : «Alyn, as ver. 18, the general word for a bed or couch; 
xpaBBaros (Acts v. 15; ix. 33), a rude pallet (see on Mark ii. 
4); xdevidcov, a small couch or litter, as here, a couch so light 
that a woman could lift and carry it away. Thus, in the 


Cu. V.] LUKE. 303 


“Lysistrata” of Aristophanes, 916, Myrrine says: “Come now, 
let me carry our couch” («AuviScov). The fourth term, «drwdpiov 
(Acts yv. 15), cannot be accurately distinguished from the last. 
The last two are peculiar to Luke. 


Into the midst before Jesus. See on Mark ii. 4. 


21. To reason. See on Mark ii. 6. The words who és this 
that speaketh blasphemy, form an iambic verse in the Greek. 


22. Perceived. See on Mark ii. 8. 
23. Walk (sepimrdtes). Lit., walk about. 


24. Unto thee (col). Standing first for emphasis. Luke 
emphasizes the direct address to the man: wnto thee I say, in 
contrast with the apparently less direct, thy sins be forgiven 
thee. In Jesus’ mind the connection between the sins and the 
man’s personal condition was assumed ; now he brings out the 
personal side of the connection. In forgiving the man’s sins 
he had healed him radically. The command to rise and walk 
was of the same piece. 


26. They were all amazed (&oraovs é\aBev &ravtas). Lit., 
amazement took hold on all, as Rev. On &xotacus, amazement, 
see on Mark v. 42. 


Strange things (apdéofa). From zapd, contrary to, and 
66£a, option. Something contrary to received opinion, and 
hence strange. Compare the English paradox. Only here in 
New Testament. 


27, 28. Compare Matt. ix. 9; Mark ii. 13, 14. 


27. He saw (éJedcato). Better, as Rev., beheld, since the 
verb denotes looking attentwely. See on Matt. xi. 7.

29. Feast (Soyv). Only here and ch. xiv. 13. From the 
same root as déyoua., to recewe. A reception. 


31. They that are whole (oi by:aivovres). Both Matthew 
and Mark use toyvovtes, the strong. This use of the verb in 
its primary sense, to be in sound health, is found in Luke vii. 
10; xv. 27; and once in John, 3 Ep. ver.2. For this meaning 
it is the regular word in medical writings. Paul uses it only in 
the metaphorical sense: sound doctrine, sound words, sound in 
faith, etc. See 1 Tim.i. 10; vi. 3; Tit. i. 13, ete. 


33. Often (zv«va). Only here, Acts xxiv. 26; 1 Tim. v. 23. 
The word literally means close-packed, as a thicket, or the 
plumage of a bird. 


Prayers (Sejces). Used by no other evangelist. From 
déopas, to want, and hence distinctively of petitionary prayer. 
In classical Greek the word is not restricted to sacred uses, but 
is employed of requests preferred to men. Rey., more correctly, 
supplications. 


34. Children of the bride-chamber. Better, as Rev., sons 
(viovs). See on Mark ii. 19. 


35. But the days will come when, etc. (€devcovrar 88 
nuépat wai drav). The A. V. follows a reading which omits 
xal, and, which is inserted in all the best texts. The thought 
is broken off. ‘The days shall come—and when the bride- 
groom shall be taken away, then shall they fast.” So Rev. 


36. A parable. “ From a garment and from wine, especially 
appropriate at a banquet ” (Bengel).

Putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old (ém/- 
Brynpa patio Kawvod émiBadrdeu él ipatiov madatov). The 
best texts, however, insert oydcas, having rent, which directly 
governs é7iPAnpa, piece ; so that the rendering is, Vo man 
having rent a piece from a new garment, putteth it, etc. So 
Rey., Vo man rendeth a piece and putteth. Both Matthew 
and Mark have cloth instead of garment, by the use of which 
latter term “the incongruity of the proceeding comes more 
strongly into prominence” (Meyer). ‘Emi®dnya, a piece, is, 
literally, a patch, from éré, upon, and Badra, to throw: some- 
thing clapped on. Compare the kindred verb here, éwuBarneu, 
putteth upon. 


The new maketh a rent (70 xawov oyifer). The best texts 
read cxyice, will rend, governing the new, instead of being 
used intransitively. Render, as Rev., He will rend the new. 


Agreeth not (ov cupdeve?). The best texts read cuppavncer, 
the future ; will not agree. So Rev. 

In Matthew and Mark there is only a single damage, that, 
namely, to the old garment, the rent in which is enlarged. In 
Luke the damage is twofold ; first, in injuring the new garment 
by cutting out a piece ; and second, in making the old garment 
appear patched, instead of widening the rent, as in Matthew 
and Mark. 


37. Bottles (acxovs). Rev., wine-skins. See on Matt. ix. 17.

mean either “whether 7 zs Ais habit to heal,” which is far- 
fetched, or “whether he is actually healing.” 


Find. Peculiar to Luke, and emphasizing the eagerness of 
the Pharisees to discover a ground of accusation. 


8. He knew (Se). Imperfect. He was all along aware.

Life (puyv). Better as Rev., a life. Though the question 
is a general one, it carries a hint of an individual life thrown 
into it by the special case at hand. See on Mark xii. 30. Wyce., 
to make a soul safe. 


10. Thy hand, The arm was not withered. 


11. They were filled with madness. Peculiar to Luke. 
"Avova, madness, is, properly, want of understanding. The word 
thus implies senseless rage, as distinguished from intelligent in- 
dignation.

occurring only here and Heb. xii. 15. From dyAos, a crowd or 
mob, with the idea of want of arrangement and discipline, and 
therefore of confusion and tumult. Hence it is applied to the 
noise and tumult of a crowd, and so passes into the sense of the 
trouble and annoyance caused by these, and of trouble generally, 
like the Latin ¢urbae. Thus Herodotus says of Croesus, when 
on the funeral-pile he uttered the name of Solon, and the inter- 
preters begged him to explain what he meant, “ and as they

pocrates, “troubled (évoyAoupévg) with a spasm or tetanus.” 


19. Sought—went out (éjrouv—eEnpxero). Both imper- 
fects. The A. V.and Rev. lose in vividness by not rendering 
them accordingly. The multitudes were all the while seeking to 
touch him, for virtue was going out of him. 


Healed (jaro). Compare Matt. xiv. 36; Mark vi. 56, where 
SvecoSnoav, were thoroughly saved, and éadforro, were saved, are 
used. Luke is more technical, using the strictly medical term, 
which occurs twenty-eight times in the New Testament, seven- 
teen of these in Luke. Luke also uses the two words employed 
by Matthew and Mark, but always with some addition showing 
the nature of the saving. Thus Luke vii. 3, where duacdoy (A. 
V., heal) is explained by ver. 7, taSjceras, the technical word, 
shall be healed, and by ver. 10, “found the servant whole (uys- 
aivovra, another professional word—see on ch. v. 31) that had 
been sick.” Compare, also, Luke viii. 35, 36, 44, 47, 48. Medi- 
cal writers do not use cotew or Siacwtew, to save, as equivalent 
to iaa9at, to heal, but in the sense of escaping from a severe ill- 
ness or from some calamity. Luke employs it in this sense— 
Acts xxvii. 44; xxviii. 1.

Kingdom of God (4 Bactrcia Tod Jeov). Matthew has king- 
dom of heaven, or of the heavens (rv ovpavev), a phrase used 
by him only, and most frequently employed by Christ himself 
to describe the kingdom ; though Matthew also uses, less fre- 
quently, kingdom of God. The two are substantially equiva- 
lent terms, though the pre-eminent title was kingdom of God, 
since it was expected to be fully realized in the Messianic era, 
when God should take upon himself the kingdom by a visible 
representative. Compare Isa. xl. 9, “ Behold your God.” The 
phrase kingdom of Heaven was common in the Rabbinical writ- 
ings, and had a double signification: the Azstorical kingdom 
and the spiritual and moral kingdom. They very often under- 
stood by it diwine worship; adoration of God; the sum of 
religious duties ; but also the Messianic kingdom. 

The kingdom of God is, essentially, the absolute dominion of 
God in the universe, both in a physical and a spiritual sense. 
It is “an organic commonwealth which has the principle of its 
existence in the will of God” (Tholuck). It was foreshadowed 
in the Jewish theocracy. The idea of the kingdom advanced 
toward clearer definition from Jacob’s prophecy of the Prince 
out of Judah (Gen. xlix. 10), through David’s prophecy of the 
everlasting kingdom and the king of righteousness and peace 
(Ps. xxii., Ixxii.), through Isaiah, until, in Daniel, its eternity 
and superiority over the kingdoms of the world are brought 
strongly out. For this kingdom Israel looked with longing, ex- 
pecting its realization in the Messiah; and while the common 
idea of the people was narrow, sectarian, Jewish, and political, 
yet “there was among the people a certain consciousness that 
the principle itself was of universal application ” (Tholuck). In 
Daniel this conception is distinctly expressed (vii. 14-27 5 iv. 25 ; 
ii. 44). In this sense it was apprehended by John the Baptist. 

The ideal kingdom is to be realized in the absolute rule of the 
eternal Son, Jesus Christ, by whom all things are made and con- 
sist (John i. 3; Col. i. 16-20), whose life of perfect obedience to 
God and whose sacrificial offering of love upon the cross reveal to 
men their true relation to God, and whose spirit works to bring 
them into this relation. The ultimate idea of the kingdom is 
that of “‘a redeemed humanity, with its divinely revealed destiny 


Cu. VL] LUKE. 311 


manifesting itself in a redigcous communion, or the Church; a 
social communion, or the state ; and an aesthetic communion, ex- 
pressing itself in forms of knowledge and art.” 

This kingdom is both present (Matt. xi. 12; xii. 28; xvi. 19; 
Luke xi. 20; xvi. 16; xvii. 215; see, also, the parables of the 
Sower, the Tares, the Leaven, and the Drag-net ; and compare 
the expression “theirs, or yours, 7s the kingdom,” Matt. v. 3; 
Luke vi. 20) and future (Dan. vii. 27; Matt. xiii. 48; xix. 28; 
Kav: Siuxye2d sp Markisx. 475 °2\Pet. palin 1)Cor, yl 9; 
Apoc. xx. sq.). As a present kingdom it is incomplete and in 
process of development. It is expanding in society like the 
grain of mustard seed (Matt. xiii. 381, 32); working toward the 
pervasion of society like the leaven in the lump (Matt. xiii. 33). 
God zs in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, and the 
Gospel of Christ is the great instrument in that process (2 Cor. 
v. 19, 20). The kingdom develops from within outward under 
the power of its essential divine energy and law of growth, 
which insures its progress and final triumph against all ob- 
stacles. Similarly, its work in reconciling and subjecting the 
world to God begins at the fountain-head of man’s life, by im- 
planting in his heart its own divine potency, and thus giving 
a divine impulse and direction to the whole man, rather than 
by moulding him from without by a moral code. The law is 
written in his heart. In like manner the State and the Church 
are shaped, not by external pressure, like the Roman empire 
and the Romish hierarchy, but by the evolution of holy char- 
acter in men. The kingdom of God in its present develop- 
ment is not identical with the Church. It is a larger movement 
which includes the Church. The Church is identified with the 
kingdom to the degree in which it is under the power of the 
spirit of Christ. ‘“ As the Old Testament kingdom of God was 
perfected and completed when it ceased to be external, and be- 
came internal by being enthroned in the heart, so, on the other 
hand, the perfection of the New Testament kingdom will con- 
sist in its complete incarnation and externalization; that is, 
when it shall attain an outward manifestation, adequately ex- 
pressing, exactly corresponding to its internal principle ” (Tho- 
luck). The consummation is described in Apoc. xxi., xxii.

Son of Man. The phrase is employed in the Old Testa- 
ment as a circumlocution for man, with special reference to his 
frailty as contrasted with God (Num. xxiii. 19; Ps. viii. 4; Job 
xxv. 6; xxxv. 8; and eighty-nine times in Ezekiel). It had 
also a Messianic meaning (Dan. vii. 13 sq.), to which our Lord 
referred in Matt. xxiv. 80; xxvi. 64. It was the title which 
Christ most frequently applied to himself; and there are but 
two instances in which it is applied to him by another, viz., by 
Stephen (Acts vii. 56) and by John (Apoe. i. 18; xiv. 14); and 
when acquiescing in the title “Son of God,” addressed to him- 
self, he sometimes immediately after substitutes “ Son of Man” 
(John i. 50, 52; Matt. xxvi. 63, 64). 

The title asserts Christ’s humanity—his absolute identifica- 
tion with our race: “his having a genuine humanity which 
could deem nothing human strange, and could be touched with 
a feeling of the infirmities of the race which he was to judge” 
(Liddon, “Our Lord’s Divinity”). It also exalts him as the 
representative ideal man. “All human history tends to him 
and radiates from him; he is the point in which humanity finds 
its unity; as St. Irenaeus says, ‘ He recapitulates it.’ He closes 
the earlier history of our race; he inaugurates its future. 
Nothing local, transient, individualizing, national, sectarian 
dwarfs the proportions of his world-embracing character. He 
rises above the parentage, the blood, the narrow horizon which 
bounded, as it seemed, his human life. He is the archetypal 
man, in whose presence distinction of race, intervals of ages, 
types of civilization, degrees of mental culture are as nothing” 
(Liddon). 


Cu. VI.] LUKE. 313 


But the title means more. As Son of Man he asserts the 
authority of judgment over all flesh. By virtue of what he is 
as Son of Man, he must be more. “The absolute relation to 
the world which he attributes to himself demands an absolute 
relation to God. . . . Heisthe Son of Man, the Lord of 
the world, the Judge, only because he is the Son of God” 
(Luthardt). Christ’s humanity can be explained only by his 
divinity. A humanity so unique demands a solution. Divested 
of all that is popularly called miraculous, viewed simply as a 
man, under the historical conditions of his life, he is a greater 
miracle than all his miracles combined. The solution is ex- 
pressed in Heb. i. 


23. Leap for joy (cxiptjcare). See ch. i. 41,44. Compare 
Matthew, de exceeding glad (ayadNao3e: see on 1 Pet. i. 6). 


Their fathers. Peculiar to Luke. 
24. Woe. These woes are not noted by Matthew. 


Have received (azéyere). In Matt. vi. 5, 16, the Rev. has 
properly changed “ they have their reward” to “ they have re- 
cewed.” The verb, compounded of aro, off or from, and éya, 
to have, literally means to have nothing left to desire. 'Thus in 
Philip. iv. 18, when Paul says, “JZ have all things (aréyw 
mdyta),” he does not mean merely an acknowledgment of the 
receipt of the Church’s gift, but that he is fudly furnished. “I 
have all things to the full.” 


Consolation (zapdkdyows). From apd, to the side of, and 
xanréo, to call or summon. Literally, a calling to one’s side to 
help ; and therefore entreaty, passing on into the sense of ex- 
hortation, and thence into that of consolatory exhortation ; and 
so coming round to mean that which one ws summoned to give 
to a suppliant—consolation. Thus it embodies the cali for 
help, and the response to the call. Its use corresponds with that 
of the kindred verb zrapaxanréw, to exhort or console. In its 
original sense of calling for aid the noun appears in the New 


B14 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VI. 


Testament only in 2 Cor. viii. 4: with much entreaty. The 
verb appears frequently in this sense, rendered beseech, pray 
(Matt. viii. 34; xiv. 36; Mark i. 40; v. 12, etc). In the sense 
of consolation or comfort the noun occurs in Luke ii. 25; vi. 24; 
2 Cor. i.3; vii. 4; Philem. 7. The verb, in Matt. 11.18; v. 4; 
Luke xvi. 25; 2 Cor. i. 4. In some instances, however, the 
meaning wavers between console and exhort. In the sense of 
exhortation or counsel, the noun may be found in Acts xiii. 15 ; 
Rom. xii. 8; Heb. xiii. 22. The verb, in Acts ii. 40; xi. 23; 
xiv. 22; Rom. xii. 8; Tit. ii. 15. Neither the noun nor the 
verb appear in the writings of John, but the kindred word 
mapaxdyT0s, the Paraclete, Comforter, or Advocate, is peculiar to 
him. On this word, see on John xiv. 16. It should be noted, 
however, that the word comfort goes deeper than its popular 
conception of soothing. It is from the later Latin confortare, 
to make strong. Thus Wycliffe renders Luke i. 80, “the child 
waxed, and was comforted in spirit” (A. V., waxed strong); and 
Tyndale, Luke xxii. 43, “there appeared an angel from heaven 
comforting him” (A. V., strengthening). The comfort which 
Christ gives is not always soothing. The Holy Spirit, the Com- 
forter, is to convince of sim and of judgment. Underlying the 
word is the sense of a wise counsel or admonition which rouses 
and braces the moral nature and encourages and strengthens it 
to do and to endure. When, therefore, Christ says ‘“ they that 
mourn shall be comforted,” he speaks in recognition of the fact 
that all sorrow is the outcome of sin, and that true comfort is 
given, not only in pardon for the past, but in strength to fight 
and resist and overcome sin. The atmosphere of the word, in 
short, is not the atmosphere of the sick-chamber, but the tonic 
breath of the open world, of moral struggle and victory; the 
atmosphere for him that climbs and toils and fights. 


25. Mourn and weep (rrevdncete xal xravoete). See on 
Matt. v. 4.

29. Cheek (ciayova). Lit., the jaw. The cheek is raped. 
The blow intended is not, therefore, a mere slap, but a heavy 
blow ; an act of violence rather than of contempt. 


Taketh away (aipovtos). Lit., taketh up, lifteth. 
Cloke—coat. See on Matt. v. 40. 


30. Every one. Peculiar to Luke. Augustine remarks, 
“omni petenti, non omnia petenti; give to every one that asks, 
but not everything he asks.” 


Asketh (airodvrz). See on Matt. xv. 23. Compare Matt.

Ask again (amaire). Only here and ch. xii. 20. Used in 
medical language of diseases demanding or requiring certain 
treatment. 


32. What thank (zro/a)? What Aindof thanks? Not what 
is your reward, but what is its guality ? On thank (ydpus), see 
on ch. i. 30. 


34, Lend (éaveifere). Properly, at interest. 


Sinners (01 duaprwdol). The article marks them as a class. 
So, often in New Testament, as when classed with publicans. 


Love. Not ¢cdovdo1, which implies an énstinctive, affectionate 
attachment, but dyara@ow, of a sentiment based on judgment 
and calculation, which selects its object for a reason. See, 
farther, on John xxi. 15-17. Tynd., the very sinners love their 
lovers. 


35. Hoping for nothing again (udev amedmitovtes). A 
later Greek word, only here in New Testament, and meaning 
originally to gwe up in despair, a sense which is adopted by 
some high authorities, and by Rev., never despairing. Luke 


316 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca. VL 


was familiar with this sense in the Septuagint. Thus Isa. xxix. 
19, “The poor among men (of dmmdmucpévor TOV avd pwrrav) 
shall rejoice.” So in Apocrypha, 2 Mac. ix. 18, “ despairing of 
his health; ” Judith ix. 11, “ A saviour of them that are with- 
out hope (amnricpévor).” According to this, the sense here 
is, “do good as those who consider nothing as lost.” The verb 
and its kindred adjective are used by medical writers to describe 
desperate cases of disease. 


Children of the Highest (viol tlorov). Rev., rightly, sons. 
Compare Matt. v. 45, 48. 


Kind (ypnords). See on Matt. xi. 30. 
36. Merciful (ocetippoves). See on Jas. v. 11. 


37. Forgive (dmodvere). Lit., release. So Rev., Christ ex- 
horts to the opposite of what he has just forbidden: “do not 
condemn, but release.” Oompare ch. xxii. 68; xxiii. 16, 17. 


38. Pressed down (qevecpévov). Only here in New Tes- 
tament. A common medical term for pressing strongly on a 
part of the body, and opposed to aavewv, to touch gently. 


Shaken together, running over. Bengel says, “ Pressed 
down, as dry articles; shaken together, as soft goods ; running 
over, as liquids.” But this is fanciful and incorrect. The 
allusion in every case is toa dry measure; and the climax in the 
three participles would be destroyed by Bengel’s interpretation. 


Bosom (rov xéAmov). The gathered fold of the wide upper 
garment, bound together with the girdle, and thus forming a 
pouch. In the Eastern markets at this day vendors may be 
seen pouring the contents of a measure into the bosom of a 
purchaser. In Ruth iii. 15, Boaz says to Ruth, “ Bring the val 
(the mantle, so Rev., Old Testament), that thou hast upon thee, 
and hold it (hold it open): and he measured six measures of 
barley into it.” Compare Isa. lxv. 7, “I will measure their

former work into their bosom ; also Jer. xxxii. 18. In Acts 
xxvii. 89, the word is used of a bay in a beach, forming a bend 
in the land like the hollow of a robe. Similarly, the Latin 
sinus means both the hanging, baggy bosom of a robe and a 
bay. 


39. Can the blind (ure Suvaras tupd0s)? The interrogative 
particle expects a negative reply. Surely the bland cannot, etc. 


Lead (cdnyeiv). Better, guide, as Rev., since the word com- 
bines the ideas of leading and instructing. 


Shall they not (ovy!)? Another interrogative particle, this 
time expecting an affirmative answer. 


40. Perfect (xatnpticpévos). Rev., rendering the participle 
more literally, perfected. See on Matt. iv. 21. The word sig- 
nifies to readjust, restore, set to rights, whether in a physical or 
a moral sense. See 1 Cor. i. 10, where Paul exhorts to be per- 
feetly joined together (katnpticpévor) in opposition to bemg 
diwided. In Gal. vi. 1, it is used of restoring a brother taken 
in a fault. Hence the meaning to perfect, as Eph. iv. 12. Used 
in medical language of setting a bone or joint. 


41. Beholdest (Snérets)—considerest («atavoets)—mote 
(xappos)—beam (doxov). See on Matt. vii. 3. 


42. Brother. “Expressing the pretence of fraternal duty. 
To this is opposed ‘ Thou hypocrite!’ ” (Bengel). 


Let me cast out (ddes éxBadw) with a studied courtesy : 
allow me to cast out. 


See clearly to cast out. See on Matt. vii. 5. 
43. A good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit (od éo7ww

mologically akin to onmw, in Jas. v. 2: “ Your riches are cor- 
rupted.” The word means rotten, stale. 


Neither. Rev., nor again. The A. V. omits again (radu, 
on the other hand). 


44, Bramble=bush (Sarov.) Matthew has tpiBonrar, thistles. 
The word occurs only once outside of Luke’s writings, in Mark 
xii. 26, where it is used as the familiar title of a section of the 
Pentateuch. Luke also uses it in the same way (xx. 37). He 
was doubtless acquainted with it medicinally, as it was exten- 
sively used by ancient physicians. Galen has a chapter on its 
medicinal uses, and the medical writings abound in prescriptions 
of which it is an ingredient. Galen also has a saying similar to 
our Lord’s: “ A farmer could never make a bramble bear 
grapes.” It is the word employed by the Septuagint for the bush 
out of which God spoke to Moses. 


Grapes (ctagvanv). Lit., a cluster of grapes. 
45. Evil. See on Lukeiii. 19. 


47. | will shew you to whom he is like. Peculiar to Luke. 
See on Matt. vi. 24. 


48. Digged deep (€oxawrev cai €8aSuvev). The A. V. re- 
gards the two words asa strong expression of a single idea; but 
the idea is twofold: he dug (through the sand), and deepened 
down into the solid rock. So Rev., rightly, he digged and went 
deep. 


The flood (7Anputpas). There is no article: a flood. The 
word occurs in Luke only, and only in this passage. As a med- 
ical term it is used of excess of fluids in the body: flooding. 


Beat vehemently (pocéppnEev). Rev., more literally, brake. 
Used by physicians of a rupture of the veins. It occurs only 
here and ver.49. Matthew has wpocéxowav, beat. 


Cu. VII.) LUKE. 319 


49. Upon the earth without a foundation. Matthew, upon 
the sand. The two men are conceived as alike selecting a spot 
where the sand overlies the rock. The one builds directly upon 
the sand, the other digs through and down into the rock. 


It fell (éecev). But the best texts read cuvérecer, fell to- 
gether, collapsed. Rev., fell in. Only here in New Testament. 
In medical language used of the falling-in of parts of the body. 
Thus Hippocrates, “the temples fadlen in: the limb quickly 
collapses or shrivels.” Matthew uses the simple verb ézecen, 


fell. 


Ruin (piypa). Lit., breaking. Only here in New Testa- 
ment. A medical term for a laceration or rupture. Matthew 
has mra@ats, the fall. 


CHAPTER VIZ.

1. Sayings (para). See on ch. i. 37. 


In the ears (ets ras axoas). Lit., intothe ears. See onears, 
Luke iv. 37. 


2. Centurion (éxatovtdpyov). From ékatov, a hundred, and 
dpyw, to command. Commander of a hundred men. Mark 
uses Kevtuptwv, a Graecized form of the Latin word centurto. A. 
centuria was originally a division consisting of a hundred things 
of a kind; and thence came to mean any division, whether con- 
sisting of a hundred or not. In military language it meant a di- 
vision of troops, a company, not necessarily of a hundred, the 
captain of which was called centurio. The numbers of a cen- 
tury varied from about fifty to a hundred. The Roman legion 
consisted of ten cohorts or o7retpa., bands, as “ the Italian band,” 
of which Cornelius was a centurion (Acts x. 1). The command- 
ers of these cohorts were called chiliarchs, or chief captains 


320 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VII. 


(John xviii. 12, Rev.). Each cohort contained six centuries, or 
companies, of which the commanders were called centurions. 
The duty of the centurion was chiefly confined to the regulation 
of his own corps, and the care of the watch. The badge of his 
office was the vitis, or vine-stock. He wore a short tunic, and 
was also known by letters on the crest of his helmet. Dean 
Howson (“ Companions of St. Paul”) remarks on the favorable 
impression left upon the mind by the officers of the Roman army 
mentioned in the New Testament, and cites, besides the centu- 
rion in this passage, the one at the cross, and Julius, who es- 
corted Paul to Rome. See, further, on Acts x. 1. 


Servant (S05\0s). A bond-servant. Matthew has rats, a 
servant, which occurs also at ver. 7. 


Dear (évripos). Lit., held in honor or value. It does not 
necessarily imply an affectionate relation between the master 
and the servant, though such may well have existed. It may 
mean only that he was a valuable servant. See on 1 Pet. ii. 4. 
In this case Luke omits the mention of the disease, which is 
given by Matthew. 


Beseeching (épwrav). Too strong. Better asking, as Rev. 
The word to beseech (7rapaxadéw) occurs in the next verse. See 
on Matt. xv. 23. 


Heal (Ssacdon). Better as Rev., save. See on ch. vi. 19. 


4. They besought him instantly (crapexdAouy o7rovdaiws). 
On besought, see on ch. vi. 24. Instantly, which commonly 
means at once, is used in its older meaning, pressingly, from the 
Latin instare, to urge or press upon. So Rom. xii. 12, “instant 
in prayer.” Wye., prayed busily. 


That he was worthy (67 aus éotw). The A. V. renders 
drt as a conjunction, that. The Rev., more correctly, takes it 
as a mark of quotation, besides properly rendering éo7tuv és, in- 
stead of was. Render as Rev., He ts worthy that thou shouldst

do this ; for the best texts read mapé£n, the second person, thou 
shouldst do, instead of the third person, wapé€eu, he shall do. 


5. He hath built (adres @xodduncev). He is emphatic; hem- 
self, at his own expense. 


A synagogue (tv ovvaywyyv). The article, “the syna- 
gogue,” marks the particular synagogue which these elders 
represented. Hence Rev., rightly, “‘owr synagogue.” “He 
did not merely avoid profaning the synagogue ” (Bengel). 


6. Went (ézopevero). The imperfect tense is explained by 
what follows. He was going, was on the way, when he was 
met by the second messenger from the centurion. 


Friends. Possibly kinsmen, not elders now. 


Trouble (cxvdrdov). Lit., worry. See on Matt. ix. 36; 
Mark v. 35, 


Worthy (icavos). Lit., sufficient. Compare Matt. iii. 11, 
“worthy to bear ;” and 2 Cor. iii. 5, “ not that we are sufficient 
(‘xavol), but our sufficiency (ixavorns) is of God.” It is also 
used in the sense of much, many, long. See ch. vii. 12; viii. 
21 jong xxeos Acts: ix. 23. 


7. Say ina word. Lit., “say with a word.” 


My servant shall be healed (/a9ntw 6 mais wov). It is 
strange that the Rev. should have omitted to note the impera- 
tive mood here, at least in the margin. The literal rendering 
is the more graphic: Let my servant be healed. Note the pro- 
fessional word for heal. See on ch. vi. 19. 


8. Also. See on Matt. viii. 9. 


Set under authority (i70 éfovciay tacadpevos). It is not 
easy to render the exact force of these words. The sense of 
21 


322 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cz. VII, 


the present participle with the verb ejui, 7 am, is very subtle. 
The words set under are commonly understood to mean placed 
in a subordinate position ; but this would be more accurately ex- 
pressed by the perfect participle, reraypévos. The present parti- 
ciple indicates something operating daily, and the centurion is 
describing not his appointed position so much as his daily course 
of life. The word set originally means arranged, drawn up wm 
order ; so that the words might be paraphrased thus: “T am 
a man whose daily course of life and duty is appointed and 
arranged by superior authority.” The centurion speaks in a 
figure which is well explained by Alford: “I know how to 
obey, being myself under authority; and I know how others 
obey, having soldiers under me. If then I, in my subordinate 
station of command, am obeyed, how much more thou, who art 
over all, and whom diseases serve as their Master.” Just what 
estimate of Jesus these words imply we cannot say. It seems 
evident, at least, that the centurion regarded him as more than 
man. If that be so, it is a question whether the word man 
(avSpwrds) may not imply more than is commonly assigned to 
it. Taking the Greek words in their order they may read, 
“For I also, a man (as compared with thee), am set under 
authority, having soldiers under myself. See on Matt. viii. 9. 


10. Whole (iyuaivovra). See on ch.v. 31. The best texts 
omit that had been sick. 


11-17. Peculiar to Luke. 


11. The day after (év 77 é&fs). Others read év T@ é&is, soon 
after. So Rev. Luke’s usage favors the latter. 


Nain. Mentioned nowhere else in the Bible. “On the 
northern slope of the rugged and barren ridge of Little Hermon, 
immediately west of Endor, which lies in a further recess of 
the same range, is the ruined village of Nain. No convent, no 
tradition marks the spot. But, under these circumstances, the 
name alone is sufficient to guarantee its authenticity. One en- 
trance alone it could have had—that which opens on the rough

hillside in its downward slope to the plain. It must have been 
in this steep descent, as, according to Eastern custom, they ‘ car- 
ried out the dead man,’ that, ‘nigh to the gate’ of the village, 
the bier was stopped, and the long procession of mourners stayed, 
and ‘the young man delivered back to his mother’” (Stanley, 
“ Sinai and Palestine”). “It is in striking accord with the one 
biblical incident in the history of Nain that renders it dear to 
the Christian heart, that about the only remains of antiquity 
are tombs. These are cut in the rock, and are situated on the 
hillside to the east of the village” (Thomson, “ Land and Book”). 


12. Carried out. The tombs were outside of the city. 


13. The Lord. See on Matt. xxi. 3. 


Saw her. Edersheim says, “ Had it been in Judaea, the hired 
mourners and musicians would have preceded the bier; in Gal- 
ilee they followed. First came the women; for, as an ancient 
Jewish commentary explains, woman, who brought death into 
our world, ought to lead the way in the funeral procession ” 
(“ Jewish Social Life ”). 


Had compassion (éordayyvic3n). From omddyxva, the 
nobler entrails, regarded as the seat of the affections. See on 
pitiful, 1 Pet. ii. 8. 


14. Touched. Not fearing the ceremonial defilement of 
contact with the dead. 


The bier (copés). In classical Greek, originally, of a vessel 
for holding anything : sometimes of a cinerary urn. Here the 
open bier. Edersheim says “ of wicker-work.” 


15. Sat up (dvexaSicev). Compare Acts ix. 40. In this in- 
transitive sense the word is used mostly by medical writers. 


Delivered (dwxev). Rev., gave. “For he had already 
ceased to belong to his mother” (Bengel). Compare ch. ix. 42.

Evil spirits (7rvevpatwy rovnpav). On trovnpés, evil, see ch. 
iii. 19. It is applied to evil spirits by Luke only, with the sin- 
gle exception of Matt. xii. 45. In accordance with its signifi- 
cation of evil on dts active side, it is applied in medicine to that 
which spreads destruction or corruption; as the poison of ser- 
pents. Note, moreover, that Luke distinguishes here between 
disease and demoniac possession, as often. See ch. vi. 17, 18; 
Will AZ sexaitro 2: 


He gave (éyapicato). More is expressed by this verb than 
simple gwing. He gave as a free, gracious, joy-giving gift.

23. Shall not be offended (4 cxavdaric94). Rev., shail 
Jind none occasion of stumbling. See on Matt. v. 29. Note 
also the conditional no¢ (wm): “shall not find, whatever may 
occur.” 


Cu. VIL] LUKE. 325 


24. To see (SedcacJar). Rev. is correct but awkward, to 
behold. The verb implies steadfast, intent gazing. See on 
Matt. xi. 7. 


25. Gorgeously apparelled (év ivaticued evdcE). Lit., a 
splendid clothing. 


Live delicately (rpudf imdpyovres). Lit., arein luxury. On 
umdpyovres, are, see on Jas. ii. 15. On tpudh, luxury, see on 
2 Pet. 11. 13, the only other place where it occurs. Compare the 
kindred verb tpud¢da, to live in luxury, Jas. v. 5. 


Kings’ courts (Gacvrelors). Only here in New Testament. 
Often rendered palaces. Sometimes, in later Greek, applied 
to a capital or royal city, a royal treasury, and a royal diadem. 


26. A prophet (spodyrnv). The popular conception of a 
prophet is limited to his foretelling future events. This is in- 
deed included in the term, but does not cover its meaning en- 
tirely. The word is from gyi, to speak, and mpd, before, in 
Front of. This meaning of the preposition may have reference 
to tume, viz., before, beforehand ; or to place, viz., in front of, 
and so, publicly ; and this latter meaning, in turn, easily runs 
into that of in behalf of; for. The prophet is, therefore, pri- 
marily, one who speaks standing before another, and thus forming 
a medium between him and the hearer. This sense runs natur- 
ally into that of instead of. Hence it is the technical term for 
the interpreter of a divine message. So Plato: “ For this rea- 
son it is customary to appoint diviners or interpreters to be 
judges of the true inspiration. Some persons call them diners, 
seers (wadvres); they do not know that they are only repeaters 
of dark sayings and visions, and are not to be called dwiners at 
all, but interpreters (rpopfrat) of things divine” (“ Timaeus,” 
72). Similarly of an adwocate to speak for, or instead of one. 
The central idea of the word is, one to whom God reveals him- 
self and through whom he speaks. The revelation may or may 
not relate to the future. The prophet is a forth-teller, not 
necessarily a foreteller. The essence of the prophetic character 


326 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VIL 


is immediate intercourse with God. One of the Hebrew names 
for “ prophet,” and, as some maintain, the earlier name, signi- 
fied a shewer or seer. See1 Sam. ix. 10; and in 1 Cor. xiv. 26- 
30, Paul shows that revelation stands in necessary connection 
with prophesying. 


27. Prepare (xatacxevdces). See on ch. i. 17. 


Least (juxpdrepos). Lit., less. Rev., but little; or, as we 
might say, “ comparatively little.” 


99. Justified God. Declaring, by being baptized, that God’s 
will concerning John’s baptism was right. 


30. Lawyers (voutxol). Not legal practitioners, but inter- 
preters and doctors of the Mosaic law.

yain through their disobedience. 


Against themselves (eis éavrovs). More strictly, wth 
reference to themselves. 


32. Children (acdiovs). Diminutive; little children. See

37. A woman who (tus). Of that class which was, etc. 


A sinner. Wye., a s¢nneress. Her presence there is ex- 
plained by the Oriental custom of strangers passing in and out 
of a house during a meal to see and converse with the guests. 
Trench cites a description of a dinner at a consul’s house in 
Damietta. ‘ Many came in and took their places on the side- 
seats, uninvited and yet unchallenged. They spoke to those at 
table on business or the news of the day, and our host spoke 
freely to them” (“Parables”). Bernard beautifully says: 
“Thanks to thee, most blessed sinner: thou hast shown the 
world a safe enough place for sinners—the feet of Jesus, which 
spurn none, reject none, repel none, and receive and admit 
all. Where alone the Pharisee vents not his haughtiness, there 
surely the Ethiopian changes his skin, and the leopard his 
spots” (cit. by Trench, “ Parables”). 


Sat (xatdxevtas). Lit., 7s reclining at meat: a lively change 
to the present tense. 


Alabaster. See on Matt. xxvi. 7.

45. Ceased (6véduvrev). Only here in New Testament. 
Common in medical language, meaning to be intermittent, and 
to discontinue giving remedies for a time. 


To kiss (katagidovca). The compound verb has the force 
of kissing tenderly, caressing. 


46. Oil (€daiw). In vv. 37, 38, the word pupov, liquid oint- 
ment, is used. This was the finer and costlier of the two. 
Christ means to say to Simon, “ thou didst not anoint my head, 
the nobler part, with ordinary oil. She hath anointed my feet 
with costly ointment. 


49. They began. Luke notes the first uprising of the

3. Steward (érvrpovov). From érurpéra, to turn toward ; 
thence to turn over to, transfer, and so commit or intrust to. 
The word thus literally means, one to whom the management

Moisture (ixudda). Only herein New Testament. Matthew 
and Mark have depth of earth. The word is the medical ex- 
pression for juices of the body, of plants, and of the earth. 
Aristophanes, metaphorically, the juice of thought (“ Clouds,” 
933). Hippocrates uses this and the preceding word together, 
comparing the juices of the body with those of the earth. 


7. Among (év péo@). In the midst. Stronger than the 
simple év, 7m, as giving more prominence to the danger. 


Sprung up with it (cusdvetcas). Only here in New Testa- 
ment. See on ver. 6, and Matt. xiii. 7. The technical word 
among physicians for closing of wounds or ulcers, and the wnit- 
ing of nerves or bones. Dioscorides uses it, as here, of plants 
growing in the same place; “ The hellebore grows together with 
the vines.” 


Choked (dmémmé£av). Lit., choked of. Matthew has the 
simple émwé£av, choked; and Mark ovvéruEav; the ovr, to-

literally means to lead up ; hence to lead up to the high sea, or 
take to sea ; put to sea. It is the word used of Jesus’ being led 
up into the wilderness and the mount of temptation (Matt. iv. 
1; Luke ii. 22); also of bringing up a sacrifice to an idol-altar

42. Thronged (cuvémrveyov). With the idea of pressing 
together (ovv) upon him: st¢jlung. The simple verb is that ren- 
dered choke, as in vv. 8, 33. 


43. Had spent (spocavakwcaca). Only here in New Tes- 
tament. Some texts omit who had spent all her living upon 
physicians. Luke, with professional sensitiveness, omits Mark’s 
statement that she had suffered many things from many physi- 
cians, and was not bettered but made worse. 


44, Hem. See on Matt. ix. 20. 
Stanched (éc7n). A common medical term. 


45. Who touched (ris 0 dyvapevds). Lit., who ts he that 
touched? Rev., who ts it that. 


Cu. VIIL] LUKE. 337 


Throng and press (cvvéyouow—dro9d(Bovew). On the 
former word, see ver. 37, and ch. iv. 38. Rev. renders the lat- 
ter, which occurs here only, more literally, crush. It means to 
squeeze out, as wine from grapes. See on tribulation, Matt. 
sis 20: 


46. Hath touched (#aro)—I perceive (éyvwv). Rev. ren- 
ders the two aorists strictly: did touch, and I perceived, with 
reference to Jesus’ knowledge of the touch at the moment it 
was applied. 


Virtue (Svvauwv). Rev., power. The evangelists use the 
word frequently of miracles—mighty works. It is used here in 
the sense of virtue, according to its use by naturalists and 
physicians. Still, too much stress must not be laid upon it as a 
mark of Luke’s professional accuracy, as Dean Plumptre in 
‘“* The Expositor,” iv., 189; since Mark uses it in his narrative 
of the same incident, and in the same sense (Mark v. 30). 


47. Falling down. Not in worship, but in terror. See on 
fell down, v. 28. 


48. In peace. See on ch. vii. 50. 


49, From the ruler of the synagogue’s house. A. V. and

Jesus. 


Dead. Placed first in the Greek order, for emphasis. 
“* Dead is thy daughter.” 


Trouble. See on Matt. ix. 36; Mark v. 35. Tyndale ren- 
ders dis-ease, in the old verbal sense of disturb. 


52. Wept and bewailed. Both imperfects, were weeping 
and bewailing. So, rightly, Rev. Compare on bewailing, Mark 
v. 38.

4" The tetrarch. See on Matt. xiv. 1. 


That was done (ra ywvoueva). The present participle. Lit., 
all that is being done. 


Was perplexed (Soper). Used by Luke only. From dud, 
through, and dropéw, to be without away out. The radical idea 
of the compound verb seems to be of one who goes through the 
whole list of possible ways, and finds no way out. Hence, éo be 
an perplexity. 


Cu. IX.] LUKE. 339 


9. He desired (€fjre). Rev., he sought. He did more than 
desire. 


10-17. Compare Mark vi. 30-44. 


10. Declared (Simyjcavro). Related everything throughout

Bethsaida. Peculiar to Luke. It means Fishing-place. 


Healed (aro) them that had need of healing (Separedas). 
See on ch. v. 15. 


12. And when the day began to wear away. Omit when, 
Render, and the day began, etc. To wear away (krlvew). Lit., 
to decline. Wye., very literally, to bow down. 


Lodge (xatadicwow). Peculiar to Luke. Primarily the 
verb means to break up or dissolve. Hence often in New Tes- 
tament to destroy (Matt. v.17; Mark xiii. 2). Intransitively, 
to take up one’s quarters ; lodge; either because the harness 
of the travellers’ horses is loosed, or because the fastenings of 
their garments are untied. The kindred word xarddupa, a 
guest-chamber, occurs, Mark xiv. 14; or ann, Luke ii. 7. 


Victuals (émrvcvticpov). Only here in New Testament. Prop- 
erly a stock of provisions. Thus Xenophon. ‘“ Cyrus hastened 
the whole journey, except when he halted in order to furnish 
himself with supplies” (émrucuticpov évexa).

See on Mark vi. 39. 


16. Brake and gave (xaré\acev—édiSov). Note the two 
tenses, as in Mark vi. 41, and see note there. 


To set before (apa%eivas). Lit., to set beside, since the 
table was at the side of the guest. A common word for serving 
upa meal. Compare Luke x. 8; Acts xvi. 34. From the sense 
of placing beside, comes that of putting in charge, committing 
(Luke xii. 48; xxiii. 46; 1 Tim. i. 18). Hence the kindred 
noun trapadjen (2 Tim. i. 12), a deposit: that which I hawe 
committed. 


17. Were filled. See on Matt. v. 6. 


There were taken up of fragments that remained to 
them twelve baskets (xa! ijp0n TO mepiccedoay avTois KNac- 
pdrov Kxopiwot Sdexa). The Rev. is more accurate, putting 
the comma after adrois, to them, instead of after cAacudTor, 
fragments ; and making the latter word depend on Ko¢guvot, bas- 
kets. Render, therefore, And there was taken up that which 
remained over to them, of broken pieces, twelve baskets. 


Baskets. See on Matt. xiv. 20. 

18-21. Compare Matt. xvi. 13-20. Mark viii. 27-80. 

18. As he was praying. Peculiar to Luke. 

20. Ye. Emphatic: “but ye, whom do ye say that lam?” 

The Christ of God. Each evangelist gives Peter’s confes- 
sion differently. Matthew, Zhe Christ, the Son of the living 
God. Mark, The Christ. See on Matt. xvi. 15. On Christ, 


gee on Matt. i. 1. 


21. He straitly charged (évriunoas). The word implies 


Cu. IX.] LUKE. 341 


an emphatic, solemn charge; its meaning being, strictly, to lay 
a penalty upon one, and thence, to charge under penalty. 


No man (ymdevi). The conditional negative: no man, who- 
ever he might be. 


22-27. Compare Matt. xvi. 21-28 ; Mark viii. 31-38; ix. 1. 


22. Be rejected (amodoxipacdjvar). The verb means to re- 
ject on scrutiny or trial, and therefore implies dedzberate rejec- 
tion. 


Of the elders (a7). Lit., from the side of; on the part of. 


23. Will come after (9ére). Not the future tense of the verb 
come, but the present of the verb to well: wills to come. See 
on Matt. i. 19; and Mark viii. 34. Rev., properly, wowld come. 


Daily. Peculiar to Luke. 


24, Will save (96\y coat). The same construction as will 
come after (ver. 23). Rev., would save. 


Life (uynv). See on soul, Mark xii. 30. 


25. Gain (cepSyoas). A merchant’s word. Jesus is putting 
the case as a common-sense question of profit and loss. 


Lose (dmonécas). “When he might have been saved” 
(Bengel). This word, in classical Greek, is used: 1. Of death in 
battle or elsewhere. 2. Of laying waste, as a city or heritage. 
3. Of losing of life, property, or other objects. As an active 
verb, to kill or demolish. 4. Of being demoralized, morally 
abandoned or ruined, as children under bad influences. In New 
Testament of killing (Matt. ii. 13; xii. 14). Of destroying and 
perishing, not only of human life, but of material and intellect- 
ual things (1 Cor. i. 19; John vi. 27; Mark ii. 22; 1 Pet. i. 1 
Jas. i. 11; Heb. i. 11). Of losing (Matt. x. 6, 42; Luke xv. 4, 
6, 8). Of moral abandonment (Luke xv. 24, 32). Of the doom 


349 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IX. 


of the impenitent (Matt. x. 28; Luke xiii. 3; John iii. 15; John 
x. 28; 2 Pet. iii, 9; Rom. ii. 12. 


Cast away (fnusw9els). Another business term. The word 
means ¢o fine, amerce, mulct ; to punish by exacting forfeit. 
Hence Rev., correctly, forfeit his own self. See on wim your 
souls, Luke xxi. 19. Also on Matt. xvi. 26. 


26. Shall be ashamed (ézrarcyvvI7). The feeling expressed 
by this word has reference to incurring dishonor or shame in the 
eyesof men. It is “the grief a man conceives from his own im- 
perfections considered with relation to the world taking notice 
of them; grief upon the sense of disesteem ” (‘‘ South,” cit. by 
Trench). Hence it does not spring out of a reverence for right 
in itself, but, from fear of the knowledge and opinion of men. 
Thus in the use of the kindred noun aicydtvn, shame, in the New 
Testament. In Luke xiv. 9, the man who impudently puts him- 
self in the highest place at the feast, and is bidden by his host 
to go lower down, begins weth shame to take the lowest place ; 
not from a right sense of his folly and conceit, but from being 
humiliated in the eyes of the guests. Thus, Heb. xii. 2, Christ 
is said to have “endured the shame,” 2.e., the public disgrace 
attaching to crucifixion. So, too, in the use of the verb, Rom. 
i. 16: “I am not ashamed of the gospel,” though espousing its 
cause subjects me to the contempt of the Jew and of the Greek, 
to whom it is astumbling-block and foolishness. Onesiphorus 
was not ashamed to be known asthe friend of a prisoner (2 Tim. 
i. 16). Compare Heb. ii. 11; xi. 16. It is used of the Son of 
Man here by a strong metaphor. Literally, of course, the glo- 
rified Christ cannot experience the sense of shame, but the idea 
at the root is the same. It will be as if he should feel himself 
disgraced before the Father and the holy angels in owning any 
fellowship with those who have been ashamed of him, 


His glory, etc. Threefold glory. His own, as the exalted 
Messiah ; the glory of God, who owns him as his dearly beloved 
son, and commits to him the judgment; and the glory of the 
angels who attend him. 


Cu. IX.] LUKE. 343 


27. Taste of death. The word ¢aste,in the sense of eape- 
rience, is often used in classical Greek; as, to taste of toes, of 
sorrow, of freedom, but never of death. The phrase, taste of 
death, is common in Rabbinical writings. In the New Testa- 
ment only here and Heb. ii. 9, used of Christ. Chrysostom 
(cited by Alford) compares Christ to a physician who first tastes 
his medicines to encourage the sick to take them. 


The kingdom of God. See on ch. vi. 20. 
28-36. Compare Matt. xvii. 1-13; Mark ix. 2-13. 


28. A mountain. Rev., the mountain. The tradition that 
this mountain was Tabor is generally abandoned, and Mount 
Hermon is commonly supposed to have been the scene of the 
transfiguration. ‘Hermon, which is indeed the centre of all 
the Promised Land, from the entering in of Hamath unto the 
river of Egypt; the mount of fruitfulness, from which the 
springs of Jordan descended to the valleys of Israel. Along its 
mighty forest-avenues, until the grass grew fair with the moun- 
tain lilies, his feet dashed in the dew of Hermon, he must have 
gone to pray his first recorded prayer about death, and from the 
steep of it, before he knelt, could see to the south all the dwell- 
ing-place of the people that had sat in darkness, and seen the 
great light—the land of Zabulon and of Naphtali, Galilee of 
the nations; could see, even with his human sight, the gleam 
of that lake by Capernaum and Chorazin, and many a place 
loved by him and vainly ministered to, whose house was now left 
unto them desolate ; and, chief of all, far in the utmost blue, 
the hills above Nazareth, sloping down to his old home: hills 
on which the stones yet lay loose that had been taken up to cast 
at him, when he left them forever” (Ruskin, “‘ Modern Paint- 
ers,” iv., 374). 


To pray. Peculiar to Luke. 


29. Was altered (éyévero érepov). Lit., became different. 
Luke avoids Matthew’s word, perapopdadn, was metamorphosed. 


344 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IX. 


He was writing for Greek readers, to whom that word repre- 
sented the transformations of heathen deities into other forms. 
See, for instance, the story of the capture of Proteus by Mene- 
laus, in the fourth book of Homer’s “ Odyssey.” Seeon Matt. 
Xvii. 2. 


White (Aevxos). In classical Greek very indefinite as an ex- 
pression of color; being used, not only of the whiteness of the 
snow, but of gray dust. Its original sense is clear. All three 
evangelists use the word, but combined with different terms. 
Thus, Matthew, as the light. Mark, ocriASovta, glistering (see 
on Mark ix. 3). Luke, éactpdmrev (only here in New Tes- 
tament), flashing as with the brilliance of lightning. Rev., 
dazzling. 


30. There talked (cuvedddovv). The imperfect is graphic ; 
as the vision revealed itself, the two were in the act of talking. 


31. This verse is peculiar to Luke. Spake (édreyov). Im- 
perfect, were speaking. 


Decease (éfodov). The Rev. retains the word of the A. V., 
though it has, to modern ears, a somewhat formal sound. No 
word, however, could more accurately represent the original, 
which is compounded of é€, owt of, and odds, a journeying ; 
and thus corresponds to the Latin decessus, a going away, 
whence the word decease. The Greek word is familiar to us as 
exodus, applied principally to the migration of the Hebrews 
from Egypt, and thus used at Heb. xi. 22, departing. In the 
mouth of Christ it covers the ideas both of death and ascension. 
Peter uses it of his own death (2 Pet. i. 15, where see note). 


He should accomplish (guerre mAnpodv). Better, as Rev., 
he was about to accomplish. “Accomplish,” or “fulfil,” is very 
significant with reference to Christ’s death. Moses and Joshua 
had begun an ewodus from Egypt, but had not accomplished the 
going out of God’s people from this present world. See Heb. 
Hii; 183 «iv, 8. 


Cu. IX.) LUKE. 345 


32. Heavy (BeBapnuévor). The perfect participle. Lit., bur- 
dened or oppressed. ‘It was but natural for these men of 
simple habits, at night, and after the long ascent, and in the 
strong mountain air, to be heavy with sleep ; and we also know 
it as a psychological fact, that, in quick reaction, after the over- 
powering influence of the strongest emotions, drowsiness would 
creep over their limbs and senses ” (Edersheim). 


33. As they were departing (év 76 diaywpiterIas dvtods). 
Lit., in their departing. The verb only here in New Testa- 
ment. The whole sentence is peculiar to Luke’s narrative. 


Master. See on ch. v. 5. 
Let us make. See on Matt. xvii. 4. 


Tabernacles. See on Matt. xvii. 4. “Jesus might have 
smiled at the naive proposal of the eager apostle that they six 
should dwell forever in the little swccéth of wattled boughs on 
the slopes of Hermon” (Farrar). 


Not knowing what he said. Not implying any reproach 
to Peter, but merely as a mark of his bewilderment in his state 
of ecstasy. 


34. A cloud. “A strange peculiarity has been noticed 
about Hermon, in the extreme rapidity of the formation of 
cloud on the summit. In a few minutes a thick cap forms 
over the top of the mountain, and as quickly disperses and 
entirely disappears” (Edersheim). 


Overshadowed them (ézrecxiafev). A beautiful imperfect : 
“began to overshadow them;” thus harmonizing with the 
words, “as they entered into.” Zhem (avrovs) must, I think, 
be confined to Moses, Elias, and Jesus. Grammatically, it 
might include all the six; but the disciples hear the voice owt 
of the cloud, and the cloud, as a symbol of the divine presence, 
rests on these three as a sign to the disciples. See Exod. xiv. 
19; xix. 16; 1 Kings viii. 10; Ps. civ. 3. 


346 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. IX,

look with pitying regard ; and by medical writers of examining 
the condition of a patient. 


39. Taketh (AapBaver). See on Mark ix. 18. 


Suddenly (é£ai@vns). Used only once outside of the writ- 
ings of Luke: Mark xiii. 36. Naturally, frequent in medical 
writers, of sudden attacks of disease. Luke has more medical 
details in his account than the other evangelists. He mentions 
the sudden coming on of the fits, and their lasting a long time. 
Mr. Hobart remarks that Aretaeus, a physician of Luke’s time, 
in treating of epilepsy, admits the possibility of its being pro- 
duced by demoniacal agency. Epilepsy was called by physicians 
“the sacred disease.” 


Bruising (cvvtpiBov). See on brwised, ch.iv.18. The word 
literally means crushing together. Fev. expresses the avy, to- 
gether, by sorely. Compare the details in Mark, gnashing the 
teeth and pining away (ix. 18). The details in Mark ix. 21, 22, 
we might rather expect to find in Luke; especially Christ’s 
question, how long he had been subject to these attacks. See 
note on Mark ix. 20.

Perverse. See on Matt. xvii. 17.

Tare (cuveorrdapagev). Only here in New Testament. Con-

the nearest rendering. Xrapayyués, a kindred noun, is the word 
for a cramp.

51. When the time was come (év 1d cuprAnpodadat Tas 
nyépas). Lit., in the fulfilling of the days. This means when 
the days were being fulfilled; not when they were fulfilled: 
when the time was drawing near. Rev., were well-nigh come. 
Luke is speaking of a period beginning with the first announce- 
ment of his sufferings, and extending to the time of his being 
received up. 


That he should be received up (ris avadyjurpews avtod). 
Lit., the days of his being taken up: his ascension into heaven. 
’ Avddnuayis occurs nowhere else in the New Testament ; but the 
kindred verb, dvadapBava, is the usual word for being received 
into heaven. See Acts i. 2, 11, 22; 1 Tim. iii. 16.

61. To bid farewell (arordéac3ar). In this sense the word 
is used only in later Greek. In classical Greek it signifies to 
set apart or assign, as a soldier to his post or an official to his 
office, and later to detach soldiers. Hence to dismiss one with 
orders. This latter sense may, as Kypke suggests, be included 
in the meaning of the word in this passage; the man desiring 
to return home, not merely to take formal leave, but also to give 
his final instructions to his friends and servants. Similarly, 
Acts xviii. 18, of Paul taking leave of the brethren at Corinth, 
and, presumably, giving them instructions at parting. In the 
New Testament the word is used invariably in the sense of bid- 
ding farewell. Mark vi. 46 is rendered by Rev. after he had 
taken leave of them. See note there, and compare Luke xiv. 
33; 2 Cor. ii. 13. 


62. Put his hand to (émrBarev éri). Lit., having laid his 
hand upon. 


Back (eis ta drricw). Lit., to things behind. “The figure is 
that of a man who, while engaged in labor, instead of keeping 
his eye on the furrow which he is drawing, looks behind at some 
object which attracts his interest. He is only half at work, 
and half-work only will be the result ” (Godet).

chosen.” Hence to proclaim any oneclected to an office. See 
on the kindred noun, shewing, ch. i. 80.

previously. Rev., rightly, seventy others, with reference to the 
twelve.

Salute no man. Oriental salutations are tedious and com- 
plicated. The command is suited to a rapid and temporary 
mission. Compare 2 Kings iv. 29. “These instructions were 
also intended to reprove another propensity which an Oriental 
can hardly resist, no matter how urgent his business. If he 
meets an acquaintance, he must stop and make an endless num- 
ber of inquiries, and answer as many. If they come upon men 
making a bargain, or discussing any other matter, they must 
pause and intrude their own ideas, and enter keenly into the 
business, though it in nowise concerns them; and, more espe- 
cially, an Oriental can never resist the temptation to assist when 
accounts are being settled or money counted out. The clink of 


coin has a positive fascination to them” (Thomson, “Land and 
Book”). 


5. Peace to this house. The usual oriental salutation. See

Wipe off (aoudoooueda). See on Lukev. 2. Only here in 
New Testament. 


13. Mighty works. See on Matt. xi. 20. 


Sackcloth (cd«xcw). From the Hebrew sak: whatis knotted 
together ; net-shaped ; coarsely woven. It was made of goats’ 
or camels’ hair (Apoc. vi. 12), and was a material similar to 
that upon which Paul wrought in tent-making. The same 
word in Hebrew is used to describe a grain-sack, and this 
coarse material of which it is made (Gen. xlii. 25; Josh. ix. 4). 
So the Greek cay means a pack or baggage. The same root, 
according to some etymologists, appears in cayrjvn, a drag-net 
(see Matt. xiii. 47), and cdyos, Latin sagum, a coarse, soldier's 
cloak. It was employed for the rough garments for mourners 
(Esth. iv. 1; 1 Kings xxi. 27), in which latter passage the 
sackcloth is put next the flesh in token of extreme sorrow. 
Compare 2 Kings vi. 30; Job xvi. 15. 


Ashes (o70d). As asign of mourning. Defiling one’s self 
with dead things, as ashes or dirt, as a sign of sorrow, was 
common among the Orientals and Greeks. Thus Homer de- 
scribes Achilles on hearing of the death of Patroclus: 


‘Grasping in both hands 
The ashes of the hearth, he showered them o’er 
His head, and soiled with them his noble face.” 
Mad, xviii., 23. 


352 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca. X. 


And Priam, mourning for Hector: 


“In the midst the aged man 
Sat with a cloak wrapped round him, and much dust 
Strewn on his head and neck, which, when he rolled 
Upon the earth, he gathered with his hands.” 
Iliad, xxiv., 162-5. 


See 1 Sam. iv. 12; 2 Sam.i. 2; xiii. 19; Job ii. 12; Ezek. 
xvii. 80; Apoc. xviii. 19. In Judith iv. 14, 15, in the mourn- 
ing over the ravages of the Assyrians, the priests minister at 
the altar, girded with sackcloth, and with ashes on their mitres. 
Sir Gardner Wilkinson, describing a funeral at Thebes, says: 
“Men, women, and children, with the body exposed above the 
waist, throw dust on their heads, or cover their faces with 
mud” (“ Modern Egypt and Thebes”). Stifling with ashes 
was a Persian mode of punishment. Compare Apocrypha, 2 
Mace. xiii. 5-7. Herodotus relates that Nitocris, an Egyptian 
queen, after having drowned the murderers of her brother, 
threw herself into an apartment full of ashes, in order to escape 
the vengeance of their friends. 


14. But (wrAjv). Rev., howbeit. See on Matt. xi. 22. 


15. Which art exalted to heaven. For 7, the article, ren- 
dered which, the best texts give un, the interrogative particle; 
and for the participle having been exalted, the future shalt be 
exalted. Render, as Rev., Shalt thow be exalted, ete. ? 


Hell. Rev., Hades. See on Matt. xvi. 18. 


16. Despiseth (a9ere?). See on Luke vii. 30, and compare 
Gal. ii. 21; iii, 15. 


17. The seventy. “ The fuller development of the new dis- 
pensation begins with the mission of the seventy, and not with 
the mission of the apostles. Its ground-work, from Luke’s point 
of sight, is the symbolic evangelization of every nation upon 
earth, and not the restoration of the twelve tribes of Israel. Ac- 
cording to Jewish tradition, there were seventy or seventy-two 


Cu. X.] LUKE. 353 


different nations and tongues in the world. Inch. x. 1, some read 
seventy-two instead of seventy” (Westcott, “Int. to the Study 
of the Gospels”). 


18. | beheld (€9eépovv). The verb denotes calm, intent, 
continuous contemplation of an object which remains before the 
spectator. So John i. 14, we beheld, implying that Jesus’ stay 
upon earth, though brief, was such that his followers could 
calmly and leisurely contemplate his glory. Compare John 11. 
23: “they beheld his miracles,” thoughtfully and attentively. 
Here it denotes the rapt contemplation of a vision. The im- 
perfect, was beholding, refers either to the time when the 
seventy were sent forth, or to the time of the triumphs which 
they are here relating. ‘“ While you were expelling the swd- 
ordinates, | was beholding the Master fall” (Godet). The Re- 
visers do not seem to have had any settled principle in their 
rendering of this word throughout the New Testament. See 
my article on the Revised New Testament, Presbytercan Lee- 
view, October, 1881, p. 646 sq. 


Satan. A transcription of the Hebrew word, derived from 
a verb to lie in wait or oppose. Hence an adversary. In this 
sense, of David, 1 Sam. xxix. 4, and of the angel who met 
Balaam, Num. xxii. 22. Compare Zech. iii. 1, 2; Job i, ii. 
AdBoros, devil, is the more common term in the New Testa- 
ment. In Apoc. xii. 9, both terms are applied to him. 


As lightning. Describing vividly a dazzling brilliance 
suddenly quenched. 


Fall (zecdvra). Lit., having fallen. The aorist marks the 
instantaneous fall, like lightning. 


21. The best texts omit Jesus. 
Rejoiced. See on 1 Pet. i. 6. 
In spirit. The best texts add 7@ dyiq, the holy, and render

I think this is stronger than desering ; rather, determined. 


Neighbor (aAnciov). See on Matt. v. 43. 

30. Answering (t7oAaBov). Used by Luke only, and in 
this sense only here. See on ch. vii. 48. It means, strictly, to 
take up; and hence, of conversation, to take up another’s dis- 
course and reply. 


Fellamong. See on Jas. i. 2. 


Thieves (Anotais). See on Matt. xxvi. 55; and Luke xxiii. 
39-43. These were not petty stealers, but men of violence, as

was shown by their treatment of the traveller. The road from 
Jerusalem to Jericho passed through a wilderness (Josh. xvi. 1), 
which was so notorious for robberies and murders that a por- 
tion of it was called “the red or bloody way,” and was pro- 
tected by a fort and a Roman garrison. 


Stripped. Not of his clothing only, but of all that he had. 


Wounded (aAnyas éridévres). Lit., having laid on blows. 
Blows or stripes is the usual sense of the word in the New Tes- 
tament. Seech. xii. 48; Acts xvi.23. It has the metaphorical 
sense of plagues in Apoc. xv. 1, 6, 8, ete. 


Half dead (ju.9avq tuyydvovta). The full force of the ex- 
pression cannot be rendered into English. The word tuyydavovra 
throws an element of chance into the case. Lit., happening to 
be half dead ; or “leaving him half dead, as it chanced ;” his 
condition being a matter of unconcern to these robbers. The 
word jyuw9avh, haif dead, occurs nowhere else in the New Tes- 
tament. The best texts, however, omit tuyxdvovta. 


31. By chance (xara cvyxuplav). Only here in New Testa- 
ment. The word means, literally, a coincidence. By coinci- 
dence of circumstances. 


There came down. Imperfect, was going down, as Rev. 


Priest. The Talmudists said that there were almost as many 
priests at Jericho as at Jerusalem. 


Passed by on the other side (avtirapyAJev). The verb 
occurs only here and ver. 32. 


39. Came and looked. Rev., saw. Seeming to imply 
that the Levite went farther than the priest in coming near to 
the wounded man, and, having observed his condition, passed on.

34. Bound up (xarédncev). Only here in New Testament. 
Wounds (tpavpuata). Only here in New Testament. 


Pouring in (émcyéwv). Rather won (ért), as Rev. Wine 
to cleanse, and oil to soothe. See Isa. i. 6. 


Oil and wine. Usual remedies for sores, wounds, etc. Hip- 
pocrates prescribes for ulcers, “Bind with soft wool, and 
sprinkle with wine and oil.” 


Beast (xrjvos). Perhaps akin to xrja, a possession ; since 
animals anciently constituted wealth, so that a piece of property 
and a beast were synonymous terms. 


Inn (avéoyeiov). Only here in New Testament. From 
map, all, and Séyopuat, to receive: a place of common reception. 
See on inn, ch. ii. 7. Remains of two xhans, or inns, on the 
road between Jericho and Jerusalem are mentioned by modern 
travellers. Porter (“ Handbook of Syria and Palestine”) speaks 
of one about a mile from Bethany, and another farther on, at 
the most dangerous part of the road, an extensive, ruined cara- 
vanserai, called Ahan el Almah, situated on the top of a bleak 
ridge. Concerning the former, Hepworth Dixon (“Holy 
Land”) says: “ About midway in the descent from Bethany to 
Jericho, in a position commanding a view of the road above 
and below, . . . on the very spot where search would be 
made for them, if no such ruins were suspected of existing, 
stands a pile of stones, archways, lengths of wall, which the 
wandering Arabs call Khan Houdjar, and still make use of as 
their own resting-place for the night. These ruins are those of 
a noble inn; the lewan, the fountain, and the court, being 
plainly traceable in the ruins.”

35. Two pence. About thirty-five cents. See on Matt. 
xx, 2. 


| will repay. The J is expressed (éyo), and is emphatic. 
Trouble Aem not for the reckoning ; JZ will repay. 


36. Was neighbor (7Anolov yeyovévat). More correctly, has 
become neighbor. Jesus throws himself back to the time of 
the story. So Rev., proved neighbor. “The neighbor Jews 
became strangers. The stranger Samaritan became neighbor to 
the wounded traveller ” (Alford). 


37. He that shewed mercy on him. Rather with him 
(wera): dealt with him as with a brother. The lawyer avoids 
the hated word Samaritan. 


Tue VisIT AT THE HOUSE IN Beruany, 38-42. Peculiar to 
Luke. 


38. Received (i7edéEato). From tio, under, and déyouat, 
to receive. Received him under her roof. Martha is marked 
as the head of the household. Itwas her house. She received 
the guest, and was chiefly busy with the preparations for his 
entertainment (ver. 40). 


39. Sat (wapaxa3éotevca). Only here in New Testament. 
Lit., sat beside (rapa). 


40. Was cumbered (srepsecraro). Only here in New Tes- 
tament. The Rev. might better have inserted in the text the 
marginal rendering, was distracted. The verb means, literally, 
to draw from around (rept). Martha’s attention, instead of 
centring round Jesus, was drawn hither and thither. The 
mepi, around, in composition with the verb, is followed imme- 
diately by another 7repi, “about much serving.” 


Came to him (émicrdca). Came up to him, as Rev., sud- 
denly stopping in her hurry. 


358 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XI. 


Hath left (caréruev). The aorist, as Rev., did leave, in- 
dicating that she had been assisting before she was drawn off 
by Jesus’ presence. Some read xarédeurev, the imperfect, was 
leaving. 


Help (cuvavtiAdBnrat). The verb consists of three elements: 
AauBdve, to take hold ; ovv, together with ; avri, recyprocally— 
doing her part as Martha does hers. It might be paraphrased, 
therefore, take hold and do her part along with me. It occurs 
only here and Rom. viii. 26, of the Spirit Helping our infirmi- 
ties, where all the elements of the verb are strikingly exempli- 
fied. 


Al. Thou art anxious (wepsuvds). See on Matt. vi. 25. 


Troubled (SopvBd&). From 3dpuBos, tumult. Anmous 
denotes the ¢nward uneasiness: troubled, the outward confusion 
and bustle. 


CHAPTER XI. 
2-4. Compare Matt. vi. 9-13. 


3. Daily bread (rov dprov tov émtovarov). Great differences 
of opinion exist among commentators as to the strict meaning 
of the word rendered daily. The principal explanations are the 
following: 


1. From émvévas, to come on. Hence, 
a. The coming, or to-morrow’s bread. 
b. Daily: regarding the days in their future succes- 
sion. 
c. Continual. 
d. Yet to come, applied to Christ, the Bread of life, 
who is to come hereafter. 


2. From éi and ovata, being. Hence, 
a. For our sustenance (physical), and so necessary. 
b. For our essential life (spiritual). 
c. Above all being, hence pre-eminent, excellent. 
d. Abundant. 


Cu. XI] LUKE. 359 


It would be profitless to the English reader to go into the dis- 
cussion. A scholar is quoted as saying that the term is “the 
rack of theologians and grammarians.” A satisfactory discus- 
sion must assume the reader’s knowledge of Greek. Those who 
are interested in the question will find it treated by Tholuck 
(“Sermon on the Mount”), and also very exhaustively by 
Bishop Lightfoot (“Ona Fresh Revision of the New Testa- 
ment”). The latter adopts the derivation from ézvévat, to come 
on, and concludes by saying, “the familiar rendering, dadly, 
which has prevailed uninterruptedly in the Western Church 
from the beginning, is a fairly adequate representation of the 
original ; nor, indeed, does the English language furnish any 
one word which would answer the purpose so well.” The ren- 
dering in the margin of Rev. is, owr bread for the coming day. 
It is objected to this that it contradicts the Lord’s precept in 
Matt. vi. 34, not to be anxious for the morrow. But the word 
does not necessarily mean the morrow. “If the prayer were 
said in the evening, no doubt it would mean the following day ; 
but supposing it to be used before dawn, it would designate the 
day then breaking” (the coming day). “And further, if the 
command not to be anxious is tantamount to a prohibition 
against prayer for the object about which we are forbidden to 
be anxious, then not only must we not pray for to-morrow’s 
food, but we must not pray for food at all; since the Lord bids 
us (Matt. vi. 25) not to be anxious for our Life” (Lightfoot, 
condensed). 


4. Forgive. See on ch. iii. 3; Jas. v. 15. 


Sins (duaprias). See on Matt. i.21. Compare debts, Matt. 
vi. 12. 


That is indebted. Matthew’s debts appears here. 


Lead (cicevéyens). Rev. gives “bring us not,” which, be- 
sides being a more accurate rendering of the word (eis, into, 
dépa, to bear or bring), avoids the invidious hint of seducing or 
enticing which attaches to lead. James tells us that God does 


860 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XL 


not tempt any man (i. 13); but.the circumstances of a man’s 
life often, indeed always, involve possibilities of temptation. 
A caution is written even over the door of God’s own house 
(Eccl. v. 1). God also sends trials to prove and chasten us; 
but something may change the salutary power of trial into the 
corrupting power of evil solicitation; and that something, as 
James tells us (i. 14), is our own evil desire. God tempteth no 
man ; but “every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his 
own lust and enticed.” We pray, therefore, “suffer us not to be 
drawn away by our own lusts: keep us out of the power of our 
own evil hearts. Thou knowest our frame, and rememberest 
that we are dust. Remember our weakness. What thou imposest 
we would not shun. What thou dost not impose, keep us from 
seeking. Forbid that our evil desire should convert our tempt- 
able condition into actual temptation. Keep us out of situations 
in which, so far as we can judge, it would be beyond our 
present strength to keep from sinning.” It is not a coward’s 
prayer. No man is a coward for being afraid of his own heart. 
It marks the highest quality of courage to know what to be 
afraid of and to fear it. To pray that God will not bring us 
within the possibility of temptation, would be to ignore our 
manhood, or to pray to be taken out of the world. But we 
may pray, and will surely pray, the more keenly conscious we 
become of the weakness of our nature, that God will not suffer 
the trials of life to become temptations to evil.

Cu. XI] LUKE. 361 


8. Importunity (dvaidecav). Only here in New Testament. 
A very striking word to describe persistence. Lit., shamedess- 
ness. As related to prayer, it is illustrated in the case of 
Abraham’s intercession for Sodom (Gen. xviii. 23-33) ; and of 
the Syro-Phoenician woman (Matt. xv. 22-28). 


9. Ask (aire?re). The word for the asking of an inferior 
(Acts xii. 20; iii. 2); and hence of man from God (Matt. vii. 
7; Jasi. 5). Christ never uses the word of his own asking 
from the Father, but always épw7@, as asking on equal terms. 
Martha shows her low conception of his person when she uses 
the term of his asking God (John xi. 22).* 


Ask, seek, knock. ‘The three repetitions of the com- 
mand are more than mere repetitions; since to seek is more 
than to ask, and to knock than to seek” (Trench, “ Parables”). 

11. Of any of you (riva). The A. V. renders as though the 
pronoun were indefinite ; but it is interrogative and commences 
the sentence. Rey., therefore, rightly, of which of you that is 
a father, etc.

By satyrs in these two passages are meant goblins shaped like

of Mendes or Pan, who, under the figure of a goat, was wor- 
shipped by the Egyptians as the fertilizing principle in nature. 
In Isa. xxxiv. 14, it is said “the screech-owl shall rest there.” 
This is rendered in margin of A. V. and in the Rev., Old Tes- 
tament, the night-monster (Hebrew, Lilith); and by Cheyne 
(Isaiah) night-fairy. The reference is to a popular superstition 
that Lilith, Adam’s first wife, forsook him and became a demon

and platters. Jesus is insisting upon ward righteousness as 
against pharisaic externalism, and says: ‘“ Your virtue consists 
in washing the outside, and making a respectable appearance. 
Cultivate rather the loving, brotherly spirit of ward right- 
eousness, which will prompt you to give of the food which the 
vessels contain (that which is within) to your suffering brother.”

the tombs, the unseen ones. The word aénros, wnapparent, oc- 
curs only here and 1 Cor. xiv. 8, of the trumpet giving an wn- 
certain sound. 


That walk over (sepirratotvres). The participle, and with- 
out the article; and therefore better, as they walk; walk about 
(arep/) on their daily business. In Matthew the sepulchres are 
whitened, that men may see them and avoid ceremonial defile- 
ment. Here they are not seen, and men walking on them are 
unconsciously defiled. See on Matt. xxiii. 27. 


45. Reproachest (i8pifes). The lawyer converts Jesus’ 
reproach (see Mark xvi. 14, wpbraided) into an insult ; the 
word meaning to outrage or affront. 


Us also («al judas). Or perhaps better, even us, the learned.

sent. The compound verb means “give your fw approval.” 
Ye think (Soxeire) ; favorably (eb); along with them (ctv). 


51. The altar and the temple. Odxou, temple, lit., house, 
is equivalent to vaod, sanctuary (Rev.), in Matt. xxiii. 35. The

Mark vi. 19. 


Provoke to speak (amroctoparigewv). Only here in New

nally to dictate to a pupil what he is to learn by heart. Thus 
Plato: “When the grammar-master dictated (amoctToparifor) 
to you” (“ Euthydemus,” 276). Hence to catechize, with the 
idea of putting words into Christ’s mouth, and making him say 
what they wanted him to say. 


54, Lying in wait--to catch (évedpevovres—Inpedoar). Met- 
aphors from hunting.

1. An innumerable multitude (ray pupiddmv tod dydov). 
The word pupias strictly means a number of ten thousand. It

Hypocrisy. See on hypocrites, Matt. xxiii. 13. 


2. Covered up (cvyxexadvupévor). Only here in New

3. Closets (tayelous). The word has the same root as 
Téuve, to cut or divide, and means an apartment where supplies 
are divided and apportioned: a treasury, magazine, and there- 
fore a secret and wellguarded place. There the steward 
(tapas), the distributor, has his seat.

pious Jew, under the influence of his early education, which 
taught him to regard Jesus as an enthusiast or even as an im-

Socrates, addressing Aristodemus, says, “ Which do you take to 
be the more worthy of admiration, those who make images 
without sense (appovd) or motion, or those who make éntelligent 
and active creations ?” (1, iv., 4). Sometimes, also, in the sense 
of crazed, frantic, but never in New Testament. 


Is required (dzractodcw). Lit., they require; i.e., the mes- 
sengers of God. The indefiniteness is impressive. 


Whose shall those things be which thou hast pro= 
vided ? The Greek order puts that first which was upper- 
most in the rich man’s thought—Ais accwmulations: “and the 
things which thou hast provided (Rev., prepared), whose shall 
they be?” God does not say, “the things which thou hast 
or possessest.” The whole question of the tenure of his prop- 
erty is opened for the rich man. He had said my fruits

and my goods. Now his proprietorship is ignored. They are 
not his. Whose shall they be? He is to be dispossessed at 
once. Plato relates how Pluto complained to Zeus that the 
souls of the dead found their way to the wrong places, be- 
cause the judged have their clothes on, and evil souls are 
clothed in fair bodies, so that the judges, who also have their 
clothes on and their souls veiled by their mortal part, are de- 
ceived. Zeus replies: “In the first place, I will deprive men 
of the foreknowledge of death which they now have. In the 
second place, they shall be entirely stripped before they are 
judged, for they shall be judged when they are dead; and the 
judge, too, shall be naked ; that is to say, dead. He, with his 
naked soul, shall pierce into the other naked soul, and they 
shall die suddenly and be deprived of all their kindred, and 
leave their brave attire strewn upon the earth ” (“‘ Gorgias,” 523). 


22. Take no thought. See on Matt. vi. 25. 


24. Consider. See on Matt. vii. 3. 
Storehouse (tayetov). See on ver. 3. 


25. Stature (7jAvxiav). The original meaning of the word is 
time of life, age. So, commonly, in classical Greek. See, also, 
John ix. 21, 23; Heb. xi. 11. The other meaning, stature, also 
occurs. Herodotus speaks of one who was of the same heeght 
(jAccujv) with another (iii. 16). But both the usage and the 
connection are in favor of the meaning age. A measure of 
time is sometimes represented by a measure of length, as in Ps. 
xxxix. 5; but, most of all, the addition of a cubit (a foot and a 
half) to one’s stature would not be a smali one, as the text im- 
plies (that which és least), buta very large one. Moreover, Christ 
is speaking of food and clothing, the object of which is to foster 
and prolong life. Rev., age, in margin.

28. Which is to-day in the field. Construe in the field with 
the grass; and render és absolutely : ewists, lives. So Rev., the 
grass in the field which to-day is. 


Oven (xdiBavov). Strictly, a covered earthen vessel, wider at 
bottom than at top, in which bread was baked by putting hot 
embers round it. The regular oven or furnace is dvds. Herod- 
otus, speaking of the papyrus-plant (byélus), the lower portion 
of which is used for food, says, “Such as wish to enjoy the by- 
blus in full perfection, bake it first in a closed vessel (év xauBdvo), 
heated to a glow” (ii., 92). 


And seek not what ye, etc. Ye is emphatic: “and ye, seek 
not what,” ete. 


29. Be ye of doubtful mind (uerewpifec9e). Only here in 
New Testament. The verb primarily means to raise to a height ; 
buoy up, as with false hopes; and so to unsettle, or ewecite, or 
keep in fluctuation. Thus Thucydides says of the war between 
Athens and Sparta: “All Hellas was excited (ueréwpos) by the 
coming conflict between the two chief cities” (ii., 8). 


33. Bags (Badddv7ia). From Bade, to throw. Something 
into which money and other things are cast. Rev., purses. See 
on ch. x. 4. Wyc., satchels. 


Moth. Compare Jas. v. 2. 


36. Shall return (avadvon). The verb means, originally, to 
unloose : so of vessels, to unloose their moorings and go to sea. 
Of departing generally. This is its sense in the only other pas- 
sage where it occurs, Philip. i. 23, “having a desire to depart, 
or break up; the metaphor being drawn from breaking up an 
encampment.” Compare departure (avadicews), 2 Tim. iv. 6. 
The rendering return is a kind of inference from this: when 
he shall leave the wedding and return.

Portion of meat (cvropérpiov). Lit., measure of food. 


In due season. At the appointed time for distributing

the lord’s delay and of the postponement of the reckoning is 
uppermost in the servant’s thought.

of observation which you apply to the heavens. 


58. When thou goest (as yap umdyes). The A. V. does not 
translate yap, for. Rev., correctly, for as thouart going. Their 
own judgment should show them the necessity of repentance 
toward God; and this duty is urged under the figure of a 
debtor who meets his creditor in the way, and whose best 
policy it is to make terms on the spot.

7. These three years | come. The best texts insert ad’ od, 
Srom which, or since. “It is three years from the time at 
which I came.” 


Cut it down (éxxowov). Rather, “cut it owt” (é«) from 
among the other trees and the vines. 


Why cumbereth it. The A. V. omits the very important 
rai, also (Rev.), which, as Trench observes, is the key-word of 
the sentence. Besides being barren in itself, it adso injures the 
soil. “ Not only is it unfruitful, but it draws away the juices 
which the vines would extract from the earth, intercepts the 
sun, and occupies room” (Bengel). The verb cumbereth (xar- 
apyet) means to make of no effect. So Rom. iii. 3, 31; Gal. 
iii. 17. Cumbereth expresses the meaning in a very general and 
comprehensive way. The specific elements included in it are 
expressed by Bengel above. De Wette, makes the land un- 
Sruitful. See on barren and unfruitful, 2 Pet. i. 8. 


Cx. XIII] LUKE. 375 


9. And if it bear fruit, well ; and if not, then after that. 
Join after that with bear fruct. “If it bear fruit for the future 
(eis TO péAXOv, Rev., thenceforth), well; but if not, thou shalt 
cut it down.” ‘Trench (“ Parables”) cites an Arabian writer’s 
receipt for curing a palm-tree of barrenness. ‘‘ Thou must take 
a hatchet, and go to the tree with a friend, unto whom thou 
sayest, ‘1 will cut down this tree, for it is unfruitful.’ He an- 
swers, ‘Do not so, this year it will certainly bear fruit’ But 
the other says, ‘It must needs be—it must be hewn down ;’ 
and gives the stem of the tree three blows with the back of the 
hatchet. But the other restrains him, crying, ‘ Nay, do it not, 
thou wilt certainly have fruit from it this year, only have 
patience with it, and be not overhasty in cutting it down ; if 
it still refuses to bear fruit, then cut it down.’ Then will the 
tree that year be certainly fruitful and bear abundantly.” 
Trench adds that this story appears to be widely spread in the 
East. 


Thou shalt cut it down. The vine-dresser does not say, 
« J will cut,” but refers that to the master. 


11. Spirit of infirmity. A spirit which caused infirmity. 
An evil demon, see ver. 16, though it is not certain that it was 
a case of possession. The details of the disease, and the noting 
of the time of its continuance, are characteristic of a physician’s 
narrative. 


Bowed together (cuvyxirrovea). Only here in New Testa- 
ment. 


Lift herself up (dvaxiypar). Only here in New Testament, 
unless John viii. 7-10 be accepted as genuine. Used by Galen 
of strengthening the vertebrae of the spine. 


12. Thou art loosed (azrodéXvoa). The only passage in 
the New Testament where the word is used of disease. Medical 
writers use it of releasing from disease, relaxing tendons, and 
taking off bandages.

thus conveying a sense of struggle. The kindred noun, dyqvia, 
agony, is used of Christ’s struggle in Gethsemane (ch. xxii. 44). 


Compare 1 Tim. vi. 12; 2 Tim. iv. 7.

Whence (7o%ev). Of what family. Ye do not belong to my 
household. See John vii. 27: “We know whence he (Jesus) 
is;” ¢.e., we know his birthplace and family. 


26. In thy presence (évdmiov cod). Not as beloved and 
familiar guests. Compare with you (ue¥ tuav), Matt. xxvi. 29. 


27.1 know not whence. “The sentence is fixed, but it is 
repeated with emphasis” (Bengel). 


Shall sit down (avaxXIjcovras). Sit down at table. Jesus 
casts his thought into a familiar Jewish image. According to 
the Jewish idea, one of the main elements of the happiness 
of the Messianic kingdom was the privilege of participating 
in splendid festive entertainments along with the patriarchs of 
the nation. With this accords ver. 30, in allusion to places at 
the banquet. Compare ch. xiv. 7-9; Matt. xxiii. 6. 


31. Day. The best texts read hour. 


Will kill (9éXeu azroxretvar). As in so many cases the A. V. 
renders as the future of the verb ¢o Kill ; whereas there are two 
distinct verbs; to will or determine, and to kill. The meaning 
is, Herod willeth or is determined to kill thee. Rev., would 
fain, seems rather feeble. 


32. That fox. Herod. Describing his cunning and cow- 
ardice. 


Cures (idcews). Used by Luke only. 


378 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XIV. 


I shall be perfected (rerecoduar). The present tense: “ the 
present of the certain future” (Meyer). The meaning is, 7 
come to an end: I have done. Expositors differ greatly. Some 
interpret, “I end my career of healing,” etc. ; others, my life. 


33. It cannot be (ov« évdéyera). The verb means to accept 
or admit ; so that the sense is, “ it is not admisszble that.” The 
expression is ironical and hyperbolical, with reference to Jeru- 
salem as having a monopoly of such martyrdoms. “It would 
be contrary to use and wont, and, in a manner, to theocratic de- 
corum, if such a prophet as I should perish elsewhere than in 
Jerusalem ” (Godet).

petty distinctions.

12. Dinner—supper. Seeon Matt. xxii.4. Supper (Setzvov) 
is the principal meal at evening, and corresponding to the 
modern late dinner. 


Call not thy friends, etc. A striking parallel occurs in 
Plato’s “‘ Phaedrus,” 233. ‘And, in general, when you make a 
feast, invite not your friend, but the beggar and the empty 
soul, for they will love you, and attend you, and come about 
your doors, and will be the best pleased, and the most grateful, 
and will invoke blessings on your head.”

Sent hisservant. “If a sheikh, bey, or emeer invites, he 
always sends a servant to call you at the proper time. This 
servant often repeats the very formula mentioned in Luke xiv. 
17: Come, for the supper is ready. The fact that this custom 
is confined to the wealthy and to the nobility is in strict agree- 
ment with the parable, where the man who made the supper is 
supposed to be of this class. It is true now, as then, that to re- 
fuse is a high insult to the maker of the feast (Thomson, “ Land 
and Book”). Palgrave mentions a similar formula of invitation 
among the Bedouins of Arabia. “The chief, or some un- 
breeched youngster of his family, comes up to us with the cus- 
tomary tefaddaloo, or do us the favor” (Central and Hastern 
Arabia ”’). 


18. Make excuse (mapaiteto3av). Also rendered in New 
Testament refuse, Heb. xii. 19, 25, where both meanings occur. 
See also 2 Tim. ii. 23, Rev. Our phrase, beg off, expresses the 
idea here.

Go (é&erJeiv). Go out (é&) from the city. 


20. | cannot. A newly married man had special indulgence 
allowed him. See Deut. xxiv.5. Herodotus relates how Croe- 
sus refused for his son an invitation to a hunt on this ground. 
‘But Croesus answered, ‘Say no more of my son going with 
you; that may not be in anywise. He is but just joined in 
wedlock, and is busy enough with that’” (i., 36). The man who 
had the most plausible excuse returned the surliest and most 
peremptory answer. Compare 1 Cor. vii. 33. 


21. Streets (wAaretas)—lanes (pvyas). The former word 
from mAartvs, broad; the broad streets contrasted with the 
narrow lanes. Wye., great streets and small streets.

the reluctance which such poor creatures would feel at accept- 
ing the invitation of a great lord. 


May be filled (yeyucd9). A very strong word ; properly of

(Bengel). 


27. His cross. More correctly, Ais own. An important 
charge. All must bear the cross, but not all the same cross: 
each one Azs own. 


98. A tower. The subject of the parable is the life of 
Christian discipleship, which is figured by a tower, a lofty 
structure, as something distinguished from the world and at- 
tracting attention. 


Counteth (an¢piger). Only here and Apoe. xiii. 18. From 
arihos, a pebble (see Apoc. il. 17), used as a counter. Thus 
Herodotus says that the Egyptians, when they calculate (Aoye- 
fovrat Widows, reckon with pebbles), move their hand from right 
to left (ii., 36). So Aristophanes, “ Reckon roughly, not with 
pebbles (ygous), but on the hand” (“ Wasps,” 656). Similarly 
calculate, from Latin caleulus, a pebble. Used also of voting. 
Thus Herodotus: “The Greeks met at the altar of Neptune, 
and took the ballots (ras wipous) wherewith they were to give 
their votes.” Plato: “And you, would you vote (av yidov 
Seto, cast your pebble) with me or against me 4” (“ Protagoras,” 
330). See Acts xxvi. 10. 


Cost (rv Sarrdvnv). Allied to Sarto, to devour. Hence ea- 
pense, as something which eats up resources.

Sufficient (eis dmapticpov). - Lit., wnto completion. The 
kindred verb dzraprifw, not used in New Testament, means to 
make even or square, and hence to complete. 


29. To finish (é«reréoar). Lit., “ to finish owt” (x). 


Behold (Jewpodvtes). Attentively watching the progress of

Begin to mock. As his resources come to an end. 
30. This man (od7os 6 dvIpwmos). With sarcastic emphasis. 


Was not able (ov« icxyvoev). From icyts, strength. See 
on power, 2 Pet. ii. 11. To be strong in body or in resources, 
and so to be worth, as Lat., valere. ‘This man was not worth 
enough, or was not good for the completion.” In this latter 
sense, Matt. v. 13, “good for nothing.” 


31. To make war against another king (érép@ Bacirei

And into such a song, such fire for fame,

founded in self-renunciation.

Shall it be seasoned. See on Mark ix. 50. 


CHAPTER XY. 


4, Inthe wilderness. Not a desert place, but uncultivated 
plains; pasturage. Note that the sheep are being pastwred in 
the wilderness. A traveller, cited anonymously by Trench, 
says: “ There are, indeed, some accursed patches, where scores 
of miles lie before you like a tawny Atlantic, one yellow wave 
rising before another. But far from infrequently there are 
regions of wild fertility where the earth shoots forth a jungle 
of aromatic shrubs ” (“ Parables ”’). 


5. When he hath found it. Matthew, Jf so be that he find it. 


On his shoulders. Lit., his own shoulders. “He might 
have employed a servant’s aid, but love and joy make the labor 
sweet to himself” (Bengel). The “Good Shepherd” is a 
favorite subject in early Christian art. “ We cannot go through 
any part of the catacombs, or turn over the pages of any col- 
lection of ancient Christian monuments, without coming across 
it again and again. We know from Tertullian that it was 
often designed upon chalices. We find it ourselves painted in 
fresco upon the roofs and walls of the sepulchral chambers ; 
rudely scratched upon gravestones, or more carefully sculptured 
on sarcophagi; traced in gold upon glass, moulded on lamps, 
engraved on rings; and, in a word, represented on every species 
of Christian monument that has come down to us. 

It was selected because it expressed the whole sum and sabe

stance of the Christian dispensation. . . . He is sometimes 
represented alone with his flock; at other times accompanied 
by his apostles, each attended by one or more sheep. Some- 
times he stands amidst many sheep; sometimes he caresses one 
only ; but most commonly—so commonly as almost to form a 
rule to which other scenes might be considered the exceptions 
—he bears a lost sheep, or even a goat, upon his shoulders 3 
(Northcote and Brownlow, “Roma Sotteranea”). A beautiful 
specimen is found in the mausoleum of Galla Placidia, at 
Ravenna, erected about 450 a.v. It is a mosaic in green and 
gold. The figure is a beautiful one, youthful in face and form, 
as is usual in the early mosaics, and surrounded by his sheep. 
Facing this appears, over the altar, the form of Christ seated 
beside a kind of furnace, on the other side of which stands a 
little open bookcase. He is engaged in casting heretical books 
into the fire. Are they, indeed, the same—the Shepherd 
Christ of the Gospels, and the polemic Christ of the ecclesiastics ? 


6. With me. ‘Not with the sheep. Our life is Azs joy” 
(Gregory, cited by Trench). 


7. Repenteth. See on Matt. iii. 2. 


8-33. Tue PARABLES OF THE Lost Corn AND OF THE PRODIGAL 
Son. Peculiar to Luke. 


8. Pieces of silver (Spayyds). Used by Luke only. A coin 
worth about eighteen cents, commonly with the image of an 
owl, a tortoise, or a head of Pallas. Asa weight, 65.5 grains. A 
common weight in dispensing medicines and writing prescrip- 
tions. Wye., transcribing the Greek word, dragmes. Tynd., 
grotes. 


9. Her friends. Female friends, for the noun is used in the 
feminine form. 


| lost. Through her own carelessness. Of the sheep, Jesus 
says “was lost.” “A sheep strays of itself, but a piece of 


Cu. XV.] LUKE. 385 


money could only be lost by a certain negligence on the part of 
such as should have kept it” (Trench). In the one case, the 
attention is fastened on the condition of the thing lost; in the 
other, upon the sorrow of the one who has lost. 


12. The portion. According to the Jewish law of inheri- 
tance, if there were but two sons, the elder would receive two 
portions, the younger the third of all movable property. A man 
might, during his lifetime, dispose of all his property by gift 
as he chose. If the share of younger children was to be dimin- 
ished by gift or taken away, the disposition must be made by a 
person presumably near death. No one in good health could 
diminish, except by gift, the legal portion of a younger son. 
The younger son thus was entitled by law to his share, though 
he had no right to claim it during his father’s lifetime. The 
request must be regarded as asking a favor (Kdersheim). 


Unto them. Even to the elder, who did not ask it. 
13. All. Everything was taken out of the father’s hands. 


Took his journey (azredjunocev), Answering to our phrase 
went abroad. 


Wasted (dvecxépmicev). The word used of winnowing grain. 
See on Matt. xxv. 24. 


With riotous living (fav aca@ras). Lit., liwing unsavingly. 
Only herein New Testament. The kindred noun, acwria, is 
rendered by the Rev., in all the three passages where it occurs, 
riot (Eph. v.18; Tit. i. 6; 1 Pet. iv. 4). See note on the last 
passage. 


14. Spent. See on cost, ch. xiv. 28. 


in that land. Want is characteristic of the “far country.” 
The prodigal feels the evil of his environment. ‘“ He (with a 
shade of emphasis) began to be in want.” 
20 


386 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XV. 


To be in want (tarepeicSar). From tortepos, behind. Com- 
pare our phrase of one in straitened circumstances, to fall be- 
hind. 


15. Joined himself (écona79n). The verb means to glue or 
cement. Very expressive here, implying that he, forced himself 
upon the citizen, who was unwilling to engage him, and who 
took him into service only upon persistent entreaty. “ The un- 
happy wretch is asort of appendage to a strange personality ” 
(Godet). Compare Acts ix. 26. Wyc., cleaved. See, also, on 
Acts v. 13. 


To feed swine. As he had received him reluctantly, so he 
gave him the meanest possible employment. An ignominious 
occupation, especially in Jewish eyes. The keeping of swine 
was prohibited to Israelites under a curse. 


16. He would fain (éreSvper). Longing desire. Imperfect 
tense, he was longing, all the while he was tending the swine. 


Filled his belly (yeuioas tHv xovdAav). The texts vary. The 
Rev. follows the reading yopracdjvar, “He would fain have 
been filled,” using the same word which is employed of filling 
those who hunger and thirst after righteousness (Matt. v. 6, see 
note), and of the five thousand (Matt. xiv. 20). Hehad wanted 
the wrong thing all along, and it was no better now. All he 
wanted was to fill his belly. 


Husks (xepatiwv). Carob-pods. The word is a diminutive 
of xépas, a horn, and means, literally, a little horn, from the 
shape of the pod. The tree is sometimes ealled in German 
Bockshornbaum, Goat’s-horn-tree. ‘The fleshy pods are from 
six to ten inches long, and one broad, lined inside with a ge- 
Jatinous substance, not wholly unpleasant to the taste when 
thoroughly ripe” (Thomson, “ Land and Book”). The shell or 
pod alone is eaten. It grows in Southern Italy and Spain, and 
it is said that during the Peninsular War the horses of the 
British cavalry were often fed upon the pods. It is also called 


Cu. XV.] uUKE. 387 


Saint John’s bread, from a tradition that the Baptist fed upon 
its fruit in the wilderness. Edersheim quotes a Jewish saying, 
“When Israel is reduced to the carob-tree, they become repent- 
ant.” 


17. Came to himself. A striking expression, putting the 
state of rebellion against God as a kind of madness. It isa won- 
derful stroke of art, to represent the beginning of repentance as 
the return of a sound consciousness. Ackermann (“ Christian 
Element in Plato”) observes that Plato thinks of redemption as 
a coming to one’s self ; an apprehending of one’s self as existent ; 
as a severing of the inmost being from the surrounding element. 
Several passages of Plato are very suggestive on this point. 
“ He who bids a man know himself, would have him know his 
soul ” (“ Alcibiades,” i., 130). ‘To see her (the soul) as she 
really is, not as we now behold her, marred by communion with 
the body and other miseries, you should look upon her with 
the eye of reason, in her original purity, and then her beauty 
would be discovered, and in her image justice would be more 
clearly seen, and injustice, and all the things which we have 
described. Thus far we have spoken the truth concerning her 
as she appears at present; but we must remember also that we 
have seen her only in a condition which may be compared to 
that of the sea-god Glaucus, whose original image can hardly 
be discerned, because his natural members are broken off and 
crushed, and in many ways damaged by the waves; and in- 
crustations have grown over them of sea-weed and shells and 
stones, so that he is liker to some sea-monster than to his nat- 
ural form. And the soul is in a similar condition, disfigured by 
ten thousand ills: but not there, Glaucon, not there must we 
look.’ 

«<¢ Where, then ?’ 

“¢ At her love of wisdom. Let us see whom she affects, and 
what converse she seeks, in virtue of her near kindred with the 
immortal and eternal and divine; also, how different she would 
become, if wholly following this superior principle, and borne 
by a divine impulse out of the ocean in which she now is, and 
disengaged from the stones and shells and things of earth and 


388 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XV. 


rock, which, in wild variety, grow around her, because she 
feeds upon earth, and is crusted over by the good things of 
this life as they are termed. Then would you see her as she 
is?” (“ Republic,” 611). 


Have bread enough and to spare (srepuocevovtas dptwy). 
Lit., abound in loaves. Wye., plenty of loaves. 


Perish. Better, Zam perishing. The best texts insert ode, 
here, in contrast with the father’s house, suggested by the fa- 
ther’s servants. 


20. His father. An affecting touch in the Greek: hes own 
father. 


Ran. Trench cites an Eastern proverb: “ Who draws near 
to me (God) an émch, I will draw near to him an el, and 
whoso walks to meet me, I will leap to meet him.” 


Kissed. See on Matt. xxvi. 49. 


21. To be called thy son. He omits make me a servant. 
The slavish spirit vanishes in the clasp of the father’s arms. 
Bengel suggests that the father would not suffer him to utter 
the news. I once heard Norman McLeod say in a sermon, 
“ Before the prodigal son reached his home he thought over 
what he should do to merit restoration. He would be a hired 
servant. But when his father came out and met him, and put 
his arms round him, and the poor boy was beginning to say 
this and that, he just shut his mouth, and said, ‘I take you to 
my heart, and that’s enough.’” 


22. To his servants. Bond-servants. There is a fine 
touch in throwing in the bond-servants immediately after thy 


son (ver. 21). 


Bring forth. Some texts add quickly (rayv). So Rev. 


Cu. XV.J LUKE. 389 


The best robe (croAnv tiv rpwtnv). Lit., a robe, the first. 
Properly of a long, flowing robe, a festive garment. See Mark 
xvi. 5; Luke xx. 46. 


Ring. See on Jas. ii. 2. Compare Gen. xli. 42. 


Shoes. Both the ring and the shoes are marks of a free 
man. Slaves went barefoot. 


23. The fatted calf. The article denoting one set apart for 
a festive occasion. Tynd., “that fatted calf.” 


24. Is alive—is found (davé&yoev—evpédn). Both aorists, 
and pointing back to a definite time in the past; doubtless the 
moment when he “came to himself.” Wrye., hath lwed. 


The Prodigal Son is a favorite subject in Christian art. The 
return of the penitent is the point most frequently chosen, but 
the dissipation in the far country and the degradation among 
the swine are also treated. The dissipation is the subject of an 
interesting picture by the younger Teniers in the gallery of the 
Louvre. The prodigal is feasting at a table with two courte- 
sans, in front of an inn, on the open shutter of which a tavern- 
score is chalked. An old woman leaning on a stick begs alms, 
possibly foreshadowing the fate of the females at the table. 
The youth holds out his glass, which a servant fills with wine. 
In the right-hand corner appears a pigsty where a stable-boy is 
feeding the swine, but with his face turned toward the table, as 
if in envy of the gay revellers there. All the costumes and other 
details of the picture are Dutch. Holbein also represents him 
feasting with his mistress, and gambling with a sharper who is 
sweeping the money off the table. The other points of the story 
are introduced into the background. Jan Steen paints him at 
table in a garden before an inn. A man plays the guitar, and 
two children are blowing bubbles—“ an allegory of the transient 
pleasures of the spendthrift.” Mrs. Jameson remarks that the 
riotous living is treated principally by the Dutch painters. The 
life among the swine is treated by Jordaens in the Dresden 
Gallery. The youth, with only a cloth about his loins, ap- 


390 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XV. 


proaches the trough where the swine are feeding, extends his 
hand, and seems to ask food of a surly swineherd, who points 
him to the trough. In the left-hand corner a young boor is 
playing on a pipe, a sorrowful contrast to the delicious music of 
the halls of pleasure. Salvator Rosa pictures him in a land- 
scape, kneeling with clasped hands amid a herd of sheep, oxen, 
goats, and swine. Rubens, in a farm-stable, on his knees near 
a trough, where a woman is feeding some swine. He looks im- 
ploringly at the woman. One of the finest examples of the 
treatment of the return is by Murillo, in the splendid picture in 
the gallery of the Duke of Sutherland. It is thus described by 
Stirling (“Annals of the Artists of Spain”): “The repentant 
youth, locked in the embrace of his father, is, of course, the 
principal figure ; his pale, emaciated countenance bespeaks the 
hardships of his husk-coveting time, and the embroidery on his 
tattered robe the splendor of his riotous living. A little white 
dog, leaping up to caress him, aids in telling the story. On one 
side of this group a man and a boy lead in the fatted calf ; on 
the other appear three servants bearing a light-blue silk dress 
of Spanish fashion, and the gold ring; and one of them seems 
to be murmuring at the honors in preparation for the lost one.” 


25. Music (cvzdovias). Asymphony: concerted music. 
26. Inquired (éruvSdvero). Imperfect. Began to inquire. 


27. Is come—safe and sound. Compare is alive—as found. 
“ How nice is the observance of all the lesser proprieties of the 
narration. The father, in the midst of all his natural affection, 
is yet full of the moral significance of his son’s return—that he 
has come back another person from what he was when he went, 
or while he tarried in that far land; he sees into the deep of 
his joy, that he is receiving him now indeed a son, once dead 
but now alive; once lost to him and to God, but now found 
alike by both. But the servant confines himself to the more 
external features of the case, to the fact that, after all he has 
gone through of excess and hardship, his father has yet received 
him safe and sound” (Trench). 


Cu. XVI] LUKE. 391 


28. He was angry (@pyicdn). Not with a mere temporary 
fit of passion, but, as the word imports, with a deep-seated 
wrath. 


29. Kid (&pidov). Some read the diminutive, épiduov, “a 
little kid.” In any event a contrast is intended between the 
kid and the fatted calf. 


30. This thy son. Not my brother, but with the bitterest 
sarcasm. 


Was come (7AJ9ev). He says came, as of a stranger. Not 
returned. 


Devoured (xatadayov). We say “eat uwp,;” the Greek said 
“eat down” (kata). The word is suggested, no doubt, by the 
mention of the calf, the kid, and the feasting. 


CHAPTER XVI. 


1-8. Tue Parasite or THE Unsust Stewarp. Peculiar to 
Luke. 


1. Steward (oixovouov). From oikos, a house, and véue, to 
distribute or dispense. Hence, one who assigns to the members 
of the household their several duties, and pays to each his 
wages. The paymaster. He kept the household stores under 
lock and seal, giving out what was required; and for this pur- 
pose received a signet-ring from his master. Wyce., Sermour, 
or farmer. Here probably the land-steward. 


Was accused (dse8A79n). Only here in New Testament. 
From 8&4, over, across, and Baddow, to throw. To carry across, 
and hence to carry reports, etc., from one to another; to carry 
false reports, and so to calumniate or slander. See on devil, 
Matt. iv. 1. The word implies malzce, but not necessarily 
falsehood. Compare Latin traducere (trans, over, ducere, to 
lead), whence traduce. 


392 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XVL 


Had wasted (as Scackopritwv). Lit.,as wasting. Rev., was 
wasting ; not merely a past offence, but something going on at 
the time of the accusation. See ch. xv. 13. 


2. How is it that | hear this (ti todto axodw)? Better as 
Rev., What is this that I hear ? 


Give an account (d7ddos tov Aéyov). Lit., “give back” 
(a6). Rev., render. The (tov) account which is due. Aris- 
tophanes has a striking parallel : “And now give back my signet ; 
for thou shalt no longer be my steward ” (‘‘ Knights,” 947). 


Thou mayest (Ouvvjcn). More strictly, as Rev., thow canst. 


3. Taketh away. Or ts taking away. He was not yet dis- 
possessed, as is shown by what follows. 


I cannot (vx icytw). See on ch. xiv. 30. “I have not 
strength.” His luxurious life had unfitted him for hard labor. 
In Aristophanes (“ Birds,” 1481), a sycophant is asked: “ Tell 
me, being a young man, do you lodge informations against 
strangers?” He replies: “ Yes; why should I suffer, for I 
know not how to dig?” 


To beg (érarteiv). See on besought, Matt. xv. 23. 
4. They may receive. The debtors of his master (ver. 5). 


5. Hecalled. Alford and Trench think that the debtors 
were together; but the words seem to me to indicate that he 
dealt with them separately. He called to him each one, and 
said unto the first ; after that (émevra) another. 


6. Measures (S8drovs). Lit., baths. The bath was a He- 
brew measure, but the amount is uncertain, since, according to 
Edersheim, there were three kinds of measurement in use in 
Palestine: the original Mosaic, corresponding with the Roman ; 
that of Jerusalem, which was a fifth larger; and the common 


Cu. XVL.] LUKE. 393 


Galilaean measurement, which was more than a fifth larger than 
the Jerusalem. Assuming the first standard, the bath would be 
about fifty-six pints, and the debt, therefore, a large one. 


Take thy bill (8¢€as cou 7a ypdupata). Lit., take back thy 
writings. Rev.,bond. Wye., obligation ; and in ver. 7, dedters. 
The plural is used for a single document. The bill is the bond 
which the buyer has given, and which is in the steward’s keep- 
ing. He gives it back to the debtor for him to alter the figures. 


Sit down quickly. It was a secret transaction, to be hur- 
ried through. 


7. To another (érép). A different one with a different 
debt, and his circumstances demanding a different rate of dis- 
count. 


Measures (xdpous). Cors. A cor was ten baths; the dry 
and the fluid measures being the same. 


8. The lord. Of the steward. Rev., properly, “/zs lord.” 


Commended. Admiring his shrewdness, though he him- 
self was defrauded. 


Unjust steward. Lit., steward of injustice. See on forget- 
ful hearer, Jas. 1. 25 ; and compare words of grace, Luke iv. 
292; unjust judge, Luke xviii. 6; son of his love, Col. i. 18; 
lust of uncleanness, 2 Pet. ii. 10. The idiom is a Hebrew one. 
The phrase expresses Jesus’ judgment on what the steward’s 
master praised. 


Wisely (fpovipas). See on Matt. x. 16. Wyc., prudently. 
I would suggest shrewdly, though in the modern sense of saga- 
ciously, since the earlier sense of shrewd was malicious, or 
wicked. Plato says: “ All knowledge separated from right- 
eousness and other virtue appears to be cunning and not 
wisdom.” In Matt. vii. 24-26, it is applied to the sagacious 


394 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Ca. XVL 


man who built his house on the rock, opposed to the foolish 
(pds) man who built on the sand. “It is a middle term, not 
bringing out prominently the moral characteristics, either good 
or evil, of the action to which it is applied, but recognizing in 
it askilful adaptation of the means to the end—affirming noth- 
ing in the way of moral approbation or disapprobation, either 
of means or end, but leaving their worth to be determined by 
other considerations” (Trench, ‘‘ Parables ”). 


In their generation (eds tiv yevedv tiv Eavtov). The A. V. 
misses the point, following Wyc.  Lit., in reference to thew 
own generation ; i.e., the body of the children of this world to 
which they belong, and are kindred. They are shrewd in deal- 
ing with their own kind ; since, as is shown in the parable, 
where the debtors were accomplices of the steward they are all 
alike unscrupulous. Tynd., in their kind. 


Than the children of light. Lit., sons of the light. The 
men of the world make their intercourse with one another more 
profitable than the sons of light do thecr intercourse with their 
own kind. The latter “forget to use God’s goods to form 
bonds of love to the contemporaries who share their character” 
(Godet) ; forget to “make friends of the mammon,” ete. 


9. Make to yourselves friends. Compare Virgil, “Ae- 
neid,” vi., 664. Among the tenants of Elysium he sees “ those 
who, by good desert, made others mindful of them.” 


Of the mammon of unrighteousness (é« Tod paywva Ths 
aoixias). The same idiom as in ver. 8, steward of injustice. 
Compare unrighteous mammon, ver. 11. Mammon should 
be spelt with one m. It is a Chaldee word, meaning riches. 
It occurs only in this chapter and at Matt. vi. 24. “Of the 
mammon” is, literally, by means of. In the phrase of wn- 
righteousness, there is implied no condemnation of property as 
such ; but it is styled wnrzghteous, or belonging to unrighteous- 
ness, because it is the characteristic and representative object 
and delight and desire of the selfish and unrighteous world: 


Cu. XVI] LUKE. 395 


their love of it being a root of all evil (1 Tim. vi. 10). Wye., 
the riches of wickedness. 


Ve fail (écAimnte). But all the best texts read éxAizn, “ when 
it (the mammon) fails.” 


They may receive. The friends. 
Habitations (cxnvds). Lit., tents or tabernacles. 


10. That which is least. A general proposition, yet with 
a reference to mammon as the least of things. See next verse. 


11. Faithful. Fidelity is, therefore, possible toward the un- 
righteous mammon. 


12. That which is another’s. God’s. Riches are not ours, 
but given us in trust. 


Your own. Equivalent to the true riches. That which 
forms part of our eternal being—the redeemed self. Compare 
the parable of the Rich Fool (ch. xii. 20), where the life or 
soul is distinguished from the possessions. “ Thy sow shall be 
required ; whose shall the wealth be?” Compare, also, rch to- 
ward God (ch. xii. 21). Chrysostom, cited by Trench, says of 
Abraham and Job, “ They did not serve mammon, but possessed 
and ruled themselves, and were masters, and not servants.” 


13. Servant (oixérns). Properly, household servant. 
Serve. See on minister, Matt. xx. 26. 


The other. See on Matt. vi. 24. 
Hold to. Seeon Matt. vi. 24. 


14, Covetous (dirdpyvpa). Rev. renders literally, accord- 
ing to the composition of the word, lovers of money. Only here

and 2 Tim. iii. 2.. Compare the kindred noun, 1 Tim. vi. 10. 
The usual word for covetous is wAeovéxrns (1 Cor. v. 10, 11; 
vi. 10). 


Derided (é£euuxrnpcfov). Only here and ch. xxiii. 35. Lit., 
to turn up the nose at. The Romans had a corresponding phrase, 
naso adunco suspendere, to hang on the hooked nose: i.e., to turn 
up the nose and make a hook of it, on which (figuratively) to 
hang the subject of ridicule. Thus Horace, in one of hissatires, 
giving an account of a pretentious banquet at the house of a 
rich miser, describes one of the guests as hanging everything to 
his nose ; i.e., making a joke of everything that occurred. The

19-31. Toe Parasite or Dives anp Lazarus. Peculiar to

19. Was clothed. Imperfect, and frequentative ; denoting 
his habitual attire. 


Purple (ropdupav). Originally the purple jish from which 
the color was obtained, and thence applied to the color itself. 
Several kinds of these were found in the Mediterranean. The 
color was contained in a vein about the neck. Under the term 
purple the ancients included three distinct colors: 1. A deep 
violet, with a black or dusky tinge ; the color meant by Homer 
in describing an ocean wave: “ As when the great sea grows 
purple with dumb swell” (“Tliad,” xiv., 16). 2. Deep scarlet 
or crimson—the Tyrian purple. 3. The deep blue of the Med- 
iterranean. The dye was permanent. Alexander is said by 
Plutarch to have found in the royal palace at Susa garments 


Cu. XVI] LUKE. 397 


which preserved their freshness of color though they had been 
laid up for nearly two hundred years ; and Mr. St. John (“‘ Man- 
ners and Customs of Ancient Greece ”) relates that a small pot of 
the dye was discovered at Pompeii which had preserved the 
tone and richness attributed to the Tyrian purple. This fixed- 
ness of color is alluded to in Isa. i. 18—though your sins were 
as scarlet, the term being rendered in the Septuagint Govvixovr, 
which, with its kindred words, denoted darker shades of red. A 
full and interesting description of the purple may be found in 
J. A. St. John’s “ Manners and Customs of Ancient Greece,” 
iii., 224 sq. 


Fine linen (Qvccov). Byssus.. A yellowish flax, and the 
linen made from it. Herodotus says it was used for enveloping 
mummies (ii., 86), a statement confirmed by microscopic exam- 
inations. He also speaks of it as a bandage for a wound (vil., 
181). It is the word used by the Septuagint for linen (Exod. 
xxv. 43 xxvili. 5; xxxv. 6, etc.). Some of the Egyptian linen 
was so fine that it was called woven air. Sir Gardner Wilkin- 
son says that some in his possession was, to the touch, compar- 
able to silk, and not inferior in texture to the finest cambric. It 
was often as transparent as lawn, a fact illustrated by the 
painted sculptures, where the entire form is often made dis- 
tinctly visible through the outer garment. Later Greek writers 
used the word for cotton and for silk. See Wilkinson’s ‘¢ An- 
cient Egyptians,” first series, iii., 114 sq., and Rawlinson’s “ His- 
tory of Ancient Egypt,” j.,487, 512. A yellow byssus was used 
by the Greeks, the material for which grew around Elis, and 
which was enormously costly. See Aeschylus, “ Persae,” 127. 


Fared sumptuously (eddpacvopevos Naprpas). Lit. mak- 
ing merry in splendor. Compare ch. xv. 23, 24, 29, 82. Wyce., 
he ate, each day, shiningly. 

20. Beggar. See on poor, Matt. v. 3. 


Lazarus. Abbreviated from’ Enedlapos, Eleazar, and mean- 
ing God a help. “It is a striking evidence of the deep im-

pression which this parable has made on the mind of Christen- 
dom, that the term dazar should have passed into so many lan- 
guages as it has, losing altogether its signification as a proper 
name” (Trench). 


Was laid (€BéBAnrTo). Lit., was thrown: cast carelessly down 
by his bearers and left there. 


Gate (wvA@va). The gateway, often separated from the 
house or temple. In Matt. xxvi. 71, it is rendered porch. 


Full of sores (etAxwpévos). Only here in New Testament. 
The regular medical term for to be ulcerated. John uses the 
kindred noun é\xos, an ulcer (Apoc. xvi. 2). See next verse. 


21. Desiring (é7udvuov). Eagerly, and not receiving what 
he desired. The same thing is implied in the story of the 
prodigal, where the same word is used, “he would fain have 
been filled ” (ch. xv. 16), but the pods did not satisfy his hunger. 


The crumbs that fell (r@v airrovtwv). Lit., the things 
falling. The best texts omit Wuylwr, crumbs. 


Moreover (a\nXa xa). Lit., but even. “ But (instead of 
finding compassion), even the dogs,” ete. 


Licked (érédevyov). Only here in New Testament. Oyril, 
cited by Hobart, says: “The only attention, and, so to speak, 
medical dressing, which his sores received, was from the dogs 
who came and licked them.” 


22. Abraham’s bosom. A Rabbinical phrase, equivalent 
to being with Abraham in Paradise. “To the Israelite Abra- 
ham seems the personal centre and meeting-point of Paradise” 


(Goebel). 


23. Hell. Rev., Hades. Where Lazarus also was, but in a 
different region. See on Matt. xvi. 18. 


Cu. XVLJ LUKE. 399 


24. Cool (catayiyxeww). Only here in New Testament. Com- 
mon in medical language. See on ch. xxi. 26. Compare the 
exquisite passage in Dante, where Messer Adamo, the false 
coiner, horribly mutilated, and in the lowest circle of Malebolge, 
Bays: 


“‘T had, while living, much of what I wished ; 
And now, alas! a drop of water crave. 
The rivulets that from the verdant hills 
Of Cassentin descend down into Arno, 
Making their channels to be soft and cold, 
Ever before me stand, and not in vain: 
For far more doth their image dry me up 
Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.” 
Inferno, xxx., 65 sq. 


Tormented (d8urdpar). Used by Luke only. Tormented is 
too strong. The word is used of the sorrow of Joseph and 
Mary when the child Jesus was missing (ch. ii. 48); and of the 
grief of the Ephesian elders on parting with Paul (Acts xx. 38) 
Rev., J am in anguish. 


25. Son (réxvov). Lit., chald. 


Receivedst (d7réAaBes). Received back (ad) as a reward 
or quittance. Compare ch. vi. 34; xvi. 30; xxii. 41. 


Gulf (ydoua). From ydoxw, to yawn. Transcribed into the 
English chasm. In medical language, of the cavities in a wound 
or ulcer. 


Is fixed (éor/pixrat). Compare ch. xxil. 32; and see on 1 
Pet. v. 10. 


97. Send him to my father’s house. Compare Dante, 
where Ciacco, the glutton, says to Dante: 


«¢ But when thon art again in the sweet world, 
I pray thee to the mind of others bring me.” 
Inferno, vi., 88.

31. Be persuaded. Dives had said, “they will repent.” 
Abraham replies, “they will not be even persuaded.” 


Though one rose. Dives had said, “if one went.” 


From the dead (é« vexpav). Dives had said from the dead, 
but using a different preposition (a7é). It is wellnigh im- 
possible to give the English reader this nice play of prepositions. 
The general distinction is amd, from the outside; éx, from 
within. Thus Luke ii. 4, Joseph went up vom (azo) Galilee, 
the province, out of (éx) the city of Nazareth. Abraham’s 
preposition (é«, owt of ) implies a more complete identification 
with the dead than Dives’ amé, from. A rising from among 
the dead was more than a messenger going from the dead. 
“We can hardly pass over the identity of the name Lazarus 
with that of him who actually was recalled from the dead ; but 
whose return, far from persuading the Pharisees, was the im- 
mediate exciting cause of their crowning act of unbelief” 
(Alford).

to our phrase, 7 pays. 


Millstone. Compare Matt. xviii.6. The correct reading here 
is A9os puduKos, a millstone ; not a great millstone as Matt. 


Thrown (é$purra). Hurled: with an underlying sense of 
violence, called out by so great an outrage. 


3. Rebuke. See on stradly charged, ch. ix. 21.

6. Sycamine. Or mulberry. Luke distinguishes between 
this and cuxopopéa, the fig-mulberry (ch. xix. 4). The names 
were sometimes confused, but a physician would readily make 
the distinction, as both were used medicinally. 


9. |trow not. Omitted by the best texts. 


10. Unprofitable (dypeior). From xpela, requirement ; 
something which the master must pay. Not useless, but having 
rendered no service beyond what was due. “The profit does 
not begin until the servant goes beyond his obligation ” (Meyer). 
“ A servant owes all things” (Bengel). 


11. Through the midst of. It may also mean between or 
on the borders of. The Am. Rev. insists on the latter. 


12. Lepers. See on ch. v. 12. 


20. With observation (werd raparnpjoews). Only here in 
New Testament. The progress of the kingdom cannot be de- 
fined by visible marks like that of an earthly kingdom. Its 
growth in the world is a process of pervasion, like the working 
of the leaven through the lump. 


21. Within. Better, in the midst of. Meyer acutely re- 
marks that “vow refers to the Pharisees, in whose hearts nothing 
certainly found a place less than did the ethical kingdom of 
God.” Moreover, Jesus is not speaking of the inmwardness of 
the kingdom, but of its presence. “The whole language of the 
kingdom of heaven being within men, rather than men being 
within the kingdom, is modern” (Trench, after Meyer).

reference to its being necessary always to pray, etc. 


Faint (éycaxeiv). To turn coward or lose heart. 
2. Regarded (évtperréyevos). See on Matt. xxi. 37. 


3. Avenge (éxdikncov). The word is too strong. It means 
do me justice. See on Rom. xii. 19. 


5. Lest by her continual coming she weary me (iva pu eis 
réros épxyouevn trwmidty pe). His TéXos, lit., wnto the end, may 
mean continually ; but weary or wear out for dmemialy is more 
than doubtful. That word is from tbra@uov, the part of the 
face under the eyes, and means to stroke wnder the eye; to give 
one a black eye. It is used only once again, by Paul, 1 Cor. 
ix. 27, and in its literal sense: “I buffet my body;” treat it as 
the boxer does his adversary. The more literal sense of this 
word, and of eds réXos, an the end, or finally, give a sound and 
much livelier meaning here. “Lest at last she come and as- 
sault me.” So Goebel and Meyer, and so Wye., “ Lest at the 
last she, coming, strangle me;” and Tynd., “ Lest at the last 
she come and rail on me.” The judge fears lest importunity 


Cu. XVII] LUKE. 403 


may culminate in personal violence. Perhaps, also, as Goebel 
suggests, he intentionally exaggerates his fear. 


6. The unjust judge. Lit., the judge of injustice. See on 
ch. xvi. 8. 


7. And shall not God. The emphasis is on God. In the 
Greek order, “and God, shall he not,” etc. 


Though he bear long with them. A very difficult pas- 
sage, and interpretations vary greatly. 


(1.) The verb paxpoSvpéw means to be long-suffering, or to 
endure patiently. Such is its usual rendering in the New Tes- 
tament. 

(2.) Them (avrois) refers not to the persecutors of God’s elect, 
but to the elect themselves. The Rev. cuts the knot by the most 
literal of renderings: “ and he is long-suffering over (é7) them.” 

(3.) The secondary meaning of restraining or delaying may 
fairly be deduced from the verb, and explained either (a) of 
delaying punishment, or (b) of delaying sympathy or help. 

The Am. Rey. adopts the former, and throws the sentence 
into the form of a question: ‘And is he slow to punish on 
their behalf” (és adrois)? I venture to suggest the following: 
Kai not infrequently has the sense of yet, or and yet. So 
Euripides: “Thou art Jove-born, and yet (cai) thy utterance 
is unjust ” (“ Helena,” 1147). Aristophanes: “ O crown, depart, 
and joy go with thee: yet («al) I part from thee unwillingly ” 
(“ Knights,” 1249). So John ix. 30: “ Ye know not from 
whence he is, and yet (xat) he hath opened my eyes.” John 
xvi. 32: “Ye shall leave me alone, and yet (xal) I am not 
alone,” etc. Render, then, “Shall not God avenge his own 
elect, which cry unto him day and night; yet he delayeth help 
on their behalf,” even as the unjust judge delayed to avenge the 
widow? Surely he will, and that ere long. This rendering, 
instead of contrasting God with the judge, carries out the 
parallel. The judge delays through indifference. God delays 
also, or seems to delay, in order to try his children’s faith, or 


404 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca XVIIL 


because his purpose is not ripe; but he, too, will do justice 
to the suppliant. Tynd., Yea, though he defer them. 


‘¢He hides himself so wondrously, 
As though there were no God; 
He is least seen when all the powers 
Of ill are most abroad. 


O there is less to try our faith, 
In our mysterious creed, 

Than in the godless look of earth 
In these our hours of need. 


It is not so, but so it looks; 
And we lose courage then; 
And doubts will come if God hath kept 
His promises to men.” 
FABER. 


8. Nevertheless. Notwithstanding God is certain to vindi- 
cate, will the Son of man find on earth a persistence in faith 
answering to the widow’s ? 


9, Despised (é€ouvIevoivras). Lit., made nothing of. Rev., 
set at nought. 


Others (rods Nowrods). The expression is stronger. Lit., 
the rest. They threw all others beside themselves into one 
class. Rev., correctly, ald others. 


10. The other (érepos). With an implication of his being 
a different man. See on Matt. vi. 24. 


Publican. See on ch. iii. 12. 


11. Stood (craSeis). Lit., having been placed. Took his 
stand. It implies taking up his position ostentatiously ; striking 
an attitude. But not necessarily in a bad sense. See on ch. 
xix. 8; and compare Acts v. 20. Standing was the ordinary 


posture of the Jews in prayer. Compare Matt. vi.5; Mark 
xi. 25. 


Cu. XVIILJ LUKE. 405 


Prayed (spoonvxero). Imperfect: began to pray, or pro- 
ceeded to pray. 


Other men (of Xourol Tav avIpadrrav). Lit., the rest of men. 
See on ver. 9. A Jewish saying is quoted that a true Rabbin 
ought to thank God every day of his life ; 1, that he was not 
created a Gentile; 2, that he was not a plebeian ; 3, that he was 
not born a woman. 


Extortioners. As the publicans. 


This publican. Lit., thés (one), the publican. This publi- 
can here. “He lets us see, even in the general enumeration, 
that he is thinking of the publican, so, afterward, he does not 
omit directly to mention him” (Goebel). 


12. Twice in the week. The law required only one fast 
in the year, that on the great day of Atonement (Lev. xvi. 29 ; 
Num. xxix. 7); though public memorial fasts were added, dur- 
ing the Captivity, on the anniversaries of national calamities. 
The Pharisees fasted every Monday and Thursday during the 
weeks between the Passover and Pentecost, and again between 
the Feast of Tabernacles and that of the Dedication of the 
Temple. 


| give tithes (a7rodexara). See on Matt. xxili. 23. 


Possess (xctaua). Wrong. The Israelite did not pay tithes 
of his possessions, but only of his gains—his annual increase. 
See Gen. xxviii. 22; Deut. xiv. 22. Besides, the verb, in the 
present tense, does not mean to possess, but to acquire; the 
meaning possess being confined to the perfect and pluperfect. 
Rev., get. Compare Matt. x. 9 (Rev.); Acts xxii. 28; Luke 
xxi. 19 (on which see note) ; 1 Thess. iv. 4 (Rev.). 


13. Standing (éo7a@s). In a timid attitude: merely standing, 
not posturing as the Pharisee. See on ver. 11.

Do not commit adultery, etc. Compare the different ar- 
rangement of the commandments by the three synoptists. 


99. Yet lackest thou one thing (étz & cou Aeizrer).  Lit., 
still one thing is lacking to thee. Mark alone adds that Jesus, 
looking upon him, loved him. 


Come (Seipo). Lit., Aether. 


93. He was very sorrowful. Rev., more correctly renders 
éyern In, he became. See on Mark x. 22.

Very rich. The Greek order forms a climax: “rich exceed- 
ingly.” 


25. Camel. See on Matt. xix. 24. 


To go through the eye ofa needle (Sua rprjuaros Bedovns 
eiceN Sev). Rev., more literally, to enter in through a needle’s 
eye. Both Matthew and Mark use another word for needle 
(pais); see on Mark x. 25. Luke alone has Bedovn, which, be- 
sides being an older term, is the peculiar word for the surgical 
needle. The other word is condemned by the Greek gramma- 
rians as barbarous.

Were said (Acyoueva). Or, more correctly, which were be- 
ing said to them at the moment. 


35-43; xix. 1. Compare Matt. xx. 29-34. Mark x. 46-52. 


39. Cried (&pagev). A stronger word than éBénoev, cried, 
in the previous verse, which is merely to ery or shout, while this 
is to cry clamorously ; to scream or shriek. Compare Matt. xv. 
23; Mark v. 5; Acts xix. 28-34. 


To be brought unto (ay9jvae mpos). Used by Luke alone 
in the sense of bringing the sick to Christ. He also uses the 
compound verb mpoodyo, which was a common medical term 
for bringing the sick to a physician, both in that and in other 
senses. See ch. ix. 41; Acts xvi. 20; xxvii. 27.

1. Jericho. The city was close to the fords of the Jordan, 
on the frontier of Peraea, and on the richest plain of Palestine, 
abounding most in the choicest productions, especially balsam ; 
and was, therefore, an appropriate seat for an officer of supe- 
rior rank to preside over the collection of revenues. See on 
Matt. ix. 9; Luke iii. 12. 


2. Named (dvopuarte Karovpuevos). Lit., called by name. Com- 
pare ch. i. 61. 


Zacchaeus. Saccat, “the just.” 


3. He sought (é&jrec). Imperfect. He was busy seeking 
as Jesus passed. 


Who he was. Lit., 7s. Not to see what kind of a person, 
but which one of the crowd he was. 


Stature (#Auxia). See on ch. xii. 25. 


4. Sycamore (cuxopopéav). From ovrh, fig-tree, and popor, 
the mulberry. The fig-mulberry, resembling the fig in its 
fruit, and the mulberry in its leaves. Some old writers de- 
rived it from pwpds, foolish, because it produced worthless figs. 
Dr. Thomson says that it bears several crops yearly, which grow 
on short stems along the trunk and the large branches. They 
are very insipid, and none but the poorer classes eat them. 
Hence Amos expresses the fact that he belongs to the humblest 
class of the community, by calling himself a gatherer of syca- 
more fruit (Amos vii. 14). It grows with its large branches 
low down and wide open, so that Zacchaeus could easily have 
climbed into it. It is a favorite and pleasant conceit with old 


Cu. XIX.] LUKE. 409 


commentators that Zacchaeus’ sycamore that day bore precious 
fruit. 


5. | must abide. ‘ Adopting the royal style which was 
familiar to him, and which commends the loyalty of a vassal in 


the most delicate manner by freely exacting his services” 
(“ Ecce Homo”). 


7. To be guest (katadica:). More correctly, Rev., lodge. 
See on ch. ix. 12. 


A sinner. See on ch. iii. 12. 


8. Stood (ctaJels). See on ch. xviii. 11. Describing a 
formal act, as of one who is about to make a solemn declara- 
tion. He was like the Pharisee in attitude, but not in spirit. 
The more formal word for standing, applied to the Pharvsee in 
the temple, is here used of the publican. 


i give. Not, It is my practice to give. Zacchaeus’ state- 
ment is not a vindication, but a vow. “I now give by way of 
restoration.” 


If | have taken anything by false accusation (€ 71 éovxo- 
ddvrnca). If—anything does not state a merely possible case, 
as if Zacchaeus were unconscious of any such extortion ; but is 
a milder way of saying “ Whatever I have taken.” See on ch. 
iii. 14. It is an odd coincidence, nothing more, that the jig- 
mulberry (sycamore) should occur in connection with the jig- 
shewer (sycophant). It was common for the publicans to put a 
fictitious value on property or income, or to advance the tax to 
those unable to pay, and then to charge usurious interest on the 
private debt. On the harsh exaction of such debts, see Matt. 
xviii. 28; Luke xii. 58. 


Fourfold. The restoration required of a thief (Exod. xxii. 1). 


11. Appear (dvadaivecSar). Only here and Acts xxi. 3. It 
means to be brought to light ; shown forth. The common phrase 
show wp (ava) represents it.

13. His ten servants (Séxa SovAous éavrod). Rev., rightly, 
changes to ten servants of has, since the Ais is emphatic; lit., 
his own. Moreover, it would be absurd to suppose that this 
nobleman, of consequence enough to be raised to a royal dig- 
nity, had but ten servants. The number of slaves in a Roman 
household was enormous, sometimes reaching hundreds. Toward 
the end of the Republic, it was considered reprehensible not to 
have a slave for every sort of work. 


Pounds (yds.) Minas. Between sixteen and eighteen dol- 
lars apiece. Meyer very aptly remarks: “The small sum 
astonishes us. Compare, on the other hand, the talents (Matt. 
xxv.). But in Matthew, the Lord transfers to his servant his 
whole property ; here he has only devoted a definite sum of 
money to the purpose of putting his servants to the proof there- 
with; and the smallness of the amount corresponds to what is 
so carefully emphasized in our parable, viz., the relation of 
faithfulness in the least to its great recompense (ver. 17); 
which relation is less regarded in the parable in Matthew” 
(‘Commentary on Luke”). 


Occupy (payparevcacde). The word occupy has lost the 
sense which it conveyed to the makers of the A. V.—that of 
using or laying out what is possessed. An occupier formerly 
meant a trader. Occupy, in the sense of to use, occurs Judges 
xvi. 11: “new ropes that never were occupied ;” which Rev. 
changes to wherewith no work hath been done. Compare the 
Prayer-Book version of the Psalter, Ps. evii. 28: “occupy 
their business in great waters.” So Latimer, “Sermons,” “ He 
that occupieth usury.” Rev., trade ye. Wyc., merchandise ye. 
Tynd., buy and sell. See on traded, Matt. xxv. 16. 


Till | come (&ws épyouar). It is strange that the Rev. follows 
this reading without comment, while the Revisers’ text takes 
no notice whatever of the reading of four of the leading manu- 
scripts, which is adopted by both Tischendorf and Westcott 
and Hort; é & épyowa, “while I come,” a condensed form of 
expression for while Igo and return.

37. The descent. Two distinct sights of Jerusalem are 
caught on this route, an inequality of ground hiding it for a 
time after one has first seen it. Verse 37 marks the jirst 
sight, verse 41 the second and nearer view (see Introduction, on 
Luke’s topographical accuracy). “ At this point (the former) the 
first view is caught of the southeastern corner of the city. 
The temple and the more northern portions are hid by the 
slope of Olivet on the right: what is seen is only Mount Zion, 
now, for the most part, a rough field, crowned with the mosque 
of David, and the angle of the western walls, but then covered 
with houses to its base, and surmounted by the castle of Herod, 
on the supposed site of the palace of David. . . . It was 
at this point that the shout of triumph burst forth from the 
multitude ” (Stanley, “‘ Sinai and Palestine”). 


41. He drew nigh. “ Again the procession advanced. The 
road descends a slight declivity, and the glimpse of the city is 
again withdrawn behind the intervening ridge of Olivet. A 
few moments, and the path mounts again; it climbs a rugged 
ascent, it reaches a ledge of smooth rock, and in an instant the

doubt that this rise and turn of the road was the exact point 
where the multitude paused again, and He, when he beheld the 
city, wept over it” (Stanley). 


42. Wept (&Aavoev). With audible weeping. 


43. A trench (ydpaxa). Rev., correctly, as Tynd., a bank. 
Only here in New Testament. The word literally means @ 
pointed stake, used in fortifying the intrenchments of a camp, 
and thence the palisade itself. In fortifying a camp or besieg- 
ing a city, a ditch was dug round the entire circuit, and the 
earth from it thrown up into a wall, upon which sharp stakes 
were fixed. Every Roman soldier carried three or four of 
these stakes on the march. Wyce., with pale.

5-19. Compare Matt. xxiv. 1-14; Mark xiii. 1-13. 
5. Stones. See on Mark xiii. 1. 


Offerings (dvadjpacw). Only here in New Testament. 
From dvatidnus, to set wp. Hence of something set up in the 
temple as a votive offering. Such were the golden vines pre- 
sented by Herod the Great, with bunches of grapes as large as 
a man, and mounted above the entrance to the holy place. The 
magnificent porch of the temple was adorned with many such 
dedicated gifts, such as a golden wreath which Sosius offered 
after he had taken Jerusalem in conjunction with Herod; and 
rich flagons which Augustus and his wife had given to the 
sanctuary. Gifts were bestowed by princes friendly to Israel, 
both on the temple and on provincial synagogues. The word 
avaSeua (Gal. i. 8, Rev.), is the same word, something devoted, 
and so devoted to evil and accursed. Luke uses the classical 
form. The other is the common or Hellenistic form. The 
two forms develop gradually a divergence in meaning ; the one 
signifying devoted in a good, the other in a bad sense. The 
same process may be observed in other languages. Thus knave, 
lad, becomes a rascal: villain, a farmer, becomes a scoundrel : 
cunning, skilful, becomes crafty.

With perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring. The 
A. V. follows the reading #yovens, the participle, roaring. The 
proper reading is 7xo0s, the noun, the roaring. Render per- 
plewity for the roaring of the sea, ete. "Hyo, roarmg, is 
properly a returned sound, an echo. Generally a ringing sound, 
as of the blows on an anvil.

notion of the word is unsteady motion, especially the rolling 
swell of the sea. Rev., better, bellows. 


96. Failing (dowvydvtwv). Only here in New Testament. 
The word originally means to leave off breathing ; to swoon. 
Thus Homer, when Laertes recognizes Ulysses :

Ulysses, drew him fainting (aroptxyovra) to his heart.”

nausea or headache.

This and kindred words in the New Testament always refer to 
intoxication, or that which intoxicates. See note on John ii. 10. 


Cares (epiuvais). See on Matt. vi. 25. 

Of this life (Siwtixais). The rendering is too general; 
though it might be difficult to give a better. Bios, afe, means 
life considered either as to its duration (1 Pet. iv. 3); the 
means of support (Mark xii. 44; Luke vili. 48; xxi. 4; 1 John 
ili. 17); or the manner of leading it (1 Tim. ii. 2). The mean- 
ing here is pertaining to the support or luxury of life ; and so 
in the only other passages where it occurs, 1 Cor. vi. 3, 4. The 
parallel is Matt. vi. 31. Wye., business of this life.

So Xenophon, “ Anabasis,” i., 1, 3. The mother of Cyrus, who 
is charged with an attempt to kill his brother, begged him off

is, he that hath not a purse or scrip (and is therefore penniless), 
let him sell his garment and buy a sword. So Wye. 


37. Have an end (rédos éyer). The phrase is synonymous 
with be accomplished (rerec Svar, Rev., fulfilled). In classical 
Greek this latter word is often used of the fulfilment of an 
oracle: also of things which are settled beyond controversy. 
The two expressions here give the two meanings. The proph- 
ecy is fulfilled ; the things concerning me are jinally settled.

41. Was withdrawn (da7reomdoIn). The Vulgate has awulsus 
est, “he was torn away,” as by an inward urgency. Godet 
adopts this view, and so, apparently, Wye., he was taken away. 
Meyer inclines to it; De Wette decidedly rejects it. Compare 
Acts xxi. 1. 


Prayed. Imperfect, began to pray.

on was not able, ch. xiv. 30; and cannot, ch. xvi. 3. Commonly 
intransitive; to prevail in or among. Used transitively only 
by Hippocrates and Luke. 


44. Being in an agony (yevdpuevos év dywvia). There is in 
the aorist participle a suggestion of a growing imtensity in the 
struggle, which is not conveyed by the simple being. Literally, 
though very awkwardly, it is, having become in an agony : hav- 
ing progressed from the first prayer (began to pray, ver. 41) into 
an intense struggle of prayer and sorrow. Wycliffe’s rendering 
hints at this: and he, made in agony, prayed. Agony occurs 
only here. It is used by medical writers, and the fact of a 
sweat accompanying an agony is also mentioned by them.

51. Suffer ye thus far. This is variously interpreted. I 
think the text requires that the words should be addressed to 
the disciples, and taken as the answer to the question, shall we 
smite, etc. The meaning then is, permit them to go so far as to 
seizeme. The expression thus corresponds with Matt. xxvi. 52,

428 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.  ([Cu. XXUIL 


11. Gorgeous (Aapumpav). Lit., bright or brilliant. Com- 
pare Acts x. 30; Apoc. xv. 6. Wye. and Tynd., white. Mark 
has purple (ropipav), and Matthew scarlet (koxkivny). 


Apparel (éc97a). The general term forraiment. Matthew 
specifies the garment (xxvii. 28). Mark has simply purple 
(xv. 17). 


13-25. Compare Matt. xxvii. 15-26; Mark xv. 6-15. 


14. Perverteth (aocrpégovta). Another compound of 
otpépo, to turn ; dvactpépovta is rendered by the same word 
in ver.2. Probably the words are used without any intentional 
distinction of meaning. Atactpépovta implies more of the idea 
of distraction (compare Wye., turning upside down); turning 
different ways; while adrootpépovra emphasizes the turning 
away (amo) of the people from their civil and religious alle- 
giance. So Wyc., turning away. 


Examined (avaxpivas). Originally implying a thorough ex- 
amination ; avd, up, from bottom to top. Technically, of a 
legal examination. 


16. Chastise (raidevoas). Originally to bring up a child 
(waits). Hence, to instruct; so Acts vii. 22, of Moses instructed 
in the wisdom of the Egyptians; and Acts xxii. 3, of Paul in- 
structed in the law. To discipline or correct, as Heb. xii. 6, 7. 
The word is not synonymous with punish, since it always im- 
plies an infliction which contemplates the subject’s amendment ; 
and hence answers to chastise or chasten. So Heb. xii. dO; 
Apoe. iii. 19. In popular speech chastise and punish are often 
confounded. Chasten is from the Latin castus, ‘* pure,” 
“chaste ;” and to chasten is, properly, to purify. This meaning 
underlies even the use of the word by Pilate, who was not 
likely to be nice in his choice of words. Instead of punishing 
him with death, he will chastise him, in order to teach him 
better. So Wyc., Z shall deliver him amended.

18. All together (zayrdn9el). The whole multitude (7790s) 
of them. Only here in New Testament. 


Away (aipe). Lit., take away. Compare Acts xxi. 36;

19. Who (éo7es). Classifying him. One of such a kind as 
that he had been imprisoned, ete. 


20. Spake (zpocedwvncev). Addressed. Compare Acts xxi. 
40; xxii. 2. Always in the New Testament in the sense of ¢o 
accost, whether an individual or a crowd. 


21. Shouted (éredavouv). Imperfect. Kept shouting. Used 
by Luke only. Compare Acts xii. 22; xxii. 24. 


22. Said (elev). Dropping the speech-making tone, and 
simply asking a question. 


23. They were instant (éméxewro). Instant, in the sense of 
urgent, pressing. See on ch. vii. 4. Compare Rom. xii. 12; 2 
Tim. iv. 2; Luke vii. 4; Acts xxvi. 7. The verb means ¢o lie 
upon, and answers to our vulgarism, to lay one’s self down to 
work. Compare Aristophanes, “ Knights,” 253: KATELKELLEVOS 
Boa, roar with all your might. Lit., roar, lying down to tt. 


Their voices. Omit of the chief priests. 


Prevailed (xaricyvov). Had power (icyus) to bear down 
(xaré) the remonstrances of Pilate. Only here and Matt.

tence. Only here in New Testament.

31. Tree (EUAw). Originally wood, timber. In later Greek, 
atree. Used of the cross by Peter, Acts v. 30 ; x. 39; and 1 Pet. 
ii. 24. Compare Gal. ili. 13. 


32. Two other. The possible omission of a comma before 
malefactors in the A. V. might make a very awkward and un- 
pleasant statement. Better Rev., two others, malefactors. 


Put to death (dvacpedjvar). Lit., to take up and carry away; 
so that the Greek idiom answers to our taken off. So Shak- 
speare : 

‘<The deep damnation of his taking off.” 
Macbeth, i., %. 
‘¢ Let her who would be rid of him, devise 
His speedy taking off.” 
Lear, v., 1. 


33. Calvary (Kpaviov). The Greek word is the translation 
of the Hebrew Golgotha. See on Matt. xxvii. 33.

Amiss (drozov). Lit., out of place, and so strange, eccentric, 
perverse ; asin 2 Thess. iii. 2, where it isrendered wnreasonable. 
The expression here answers nearly to our familiar phrase, “has 
done nothing out of the way.” Compare Acts xxvill. 6; no 
harm. 


42. Into thy kingdom. Some texts read for eis, ento, év, wn. 
So Rev. In that case we must understand, “in thy kingly 


glory.” 


43. In Paradise (aapadeiow). Originally an enclosed park, 
or pleasure-ground. Xenophon uses it of the parks of the Per- 
sian kings and nobles. “There (at Celaenae) Cyrus had a 
palace and a great park (zrapdSeoos), full of wild animals, which 
he hunted on horseback. . . . Through the midst of the 
park flows the river Maeander (“‘ Anabasis,” 1., 2, 7). And again: 
«The Greeks encamped near a great and beautiful park, thickly 
grown with all kinds of trees” (ii, 4,14.) In the Septuagint, 
Gen. ii. 8, of the garden of Eden. In the Jewish theology, the 
department of Hades where the blessed souls await the resur- 
rection ; and therefore equivalent to Abraham’s bosom (ch. xvi. 
22, 23). It occurs three times in the New Testament : here ; 2 
Cor. xii. 4; Apoc. ii. 7; and always of the abode of the blessed. 


‘‘ Where’er thou roam’st, one happy soul, we know, 
Seen at thy side in woe, 
Waits on thy triumph—even as all the blest 
With him and Thee shall rest. 
Each on his cross, by Thee we hang awhile, 
Watching thy patient smile, 
Till we have learn’d to say, ‘’Tis justly done, 
Only in glory, Lord, thy sinful servant own.’”

50. Councillor. See on Mark xy. 43. Matthew calls him 
rich ; Mark, honorable ; Luke, good and just. 


51. Consented (cvyxaratedeévos). Only here in New 
Testament. Another of Luke’s numerous compounds. The 
Greek student will be struck with the array of compounds, 
from ver. 49 to 56, inclusive. The verb means to put (ré9nut), 
down (kata), along with (cvv). Hence to put down the same 
vote or opinion with another: to agree with or assent to. 


53. Linen (cwdom). See on Mark xiv. 51; and compare 
Luke xvi. 19. 


Hewn in stone (Aa£evrd). Only here in New Testament, 
and not at all in classical Greek. 


56. Returned (d7roctpéyaca). This word occurs thirty-two 
times in Luke, and only three times in the rest of the New 
Testament. It is a significant fact that, reckoning the aggregate 
space occupied by the four Gospels, nearly one-sixth of the 
whole amount is occupied with the account of the twenty-four 
hours beginning with the last supper and ending with the

burial of Jesus. There is no day in all Bible history narrated 
with the fulness of that day. If we possessed the whole life of 
Christ, written with the same detail, the record would occupy 
one hundred and eighty volumes as large as the whole Bible. 


CHAPTER XXIV. 
1-3. Compare Matt. xxviii. 1; Mark xvi. 2-4. 


1. Very early in the morning (dp3pov BaXws). Lit., at 
deep dawn, or the dawn being deep. It is not uncommon in 
Greek to find BaJus, deep, used of time ; as deep or late even- 
ing. Plutarch says of Alexander, that he supped “at deep 
evening ;” i.e. late at night. Philo says that the Hebrews 
crossed the Red Sea “about deep dawn (as here), while others 
were yet in bed.” So Socrates, in prison, asks Crito the time 
of day. He replies, ép9pos Batis, the dawn is deep, i.e. breaking 
(Plato, “ Crito,” 43).

13. Threescore furlongs. Seven miles. 


15. Went with (cuveropevero). The use of the imperfect 
here is very beautiful. Jesus drew near while they were ab- 
sorbed in their talk, and was already walking with them when 
they observed him. 


17. Ve have (dvt:Bddrere). Lit., throw back and forth ; 
exchange. 


‘¢ Discussed a doubt and tossed it to and fro”? (Tennyson). 


And are sad (cxv9pw7roi).. Only here and Matt. vi. 16, on 
which see note. The best texts put the interrogation point

looking sad. So Rev. 


18. Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem (cd povos 
mapouxels Lepovoadnp). Ilapouxeiv, to dwell as a stranger, is 
used in later Greek of strangers who have no rights of citi- 
zenship, and no settled home. Compare Heb. xi. 9. See on 
strangers, 1 Pet.i. 1; and compare sojourning, 1 Pet. i. 17. 
The only of the A. V. is commonly understood adverbially : 
“ Are you nothing but a stranger?” But the emphasis of the 
question falls there, and the word is an adjective. Render 
“ Dost thou alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem?” Are you 
the only one who sojourns as a stranger in Jerusalem, and who 
does not know, ete. So, nearly, Wyc., Zhow alone art a pilgrim 
in Jerusalem. 


18. What things (zoia). Lit., “ what kind of things.” 


21. Trusted (jAmifouev). More correctly, hoped. Imper- 
fect: were hoping all the while. 


Should have redeemed. Rev., more correctly, should re- 
deem (Autpovadar). See on 1 Pet. i. 18. 


Beside all this (ctv waow tovrois). Lit., with all these 
things : his betrayal and crucifixion, ete. 


Cu. XXIV.] LUKE. 435 


To-day is the third day (tpirnv ravrnv nucpav dyes onpepor).

cannot be neatly rendered. Literally it is, “ He (Christ) is 
passing (aye) this day as the third.” Rev., Zé ts now the third 
day since, ete. 


22. Made us astonished (é&éorncav). Literally the verb 
means to put out of place; and so, to drive one out of his 
senses. Hence the A. V. is feeble. Rev., better, amazed us. 


Early (opdpwat). Lit., early ones. Only here and Apoc. 
xxii. 16. Compare ép9pos, dawn, ver. 1. 


23. That they had seen—which said. Cleopas, absorbed 
in his story, throws himself back to the time of his interview 
with the women. Lit., ‘“‘ They came saying that they have seen 
a vision of angels which say ” (Aéyoucwy). 


25. Fools and slow of heart (avénroi nai Bpadeis TH xapdia). 
This is an unfortunate translation, in the light of the ordinary, 
popular use of the word fool. Jesus would never have called 
those sorrowful disciples foo/s in that sense. The word is com- 
pounded of 4, not, and voéw, which implies, besides seeing, per- 
ception of the mind as consequent upon sight. It is therefore 
equivalent to dull of perception. They had read what the 
prophets had spoken, but had failed to perceive its application 
to Christ. While this rebuke relates to the wnderstanding, the - 
following one, slow of heart, goes deeper, and contemplates the 
region of feeling and moral susceptibility. Your heart is dull 
and slow to respond to these testimonies of your own prophets. 
Compare hardness of heart, Mark xvi. 14. 


All (émi wacw). Rev., rightly, am all ; relying upon (éré) all 
the utterances of the prophets. 


26. Ought not (ovyi éée). The A. V. does not convey the 
precise meaning, which is, that, in the eternal order of things, 
and in fulfilment of the eternal counsel of God as expressed in 


436 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.  [Cu. XXIV. 


the prophecies, it was essentially fitting that Christ should suffer. 
Rev. is clumsy but correct: behoved at not the Christ to suffer ? 


27. He expounded (Siepyrvvev). Or interpreted : through- 
out (Sud). Imperfect, he went on interpreting from passage to 
passage. 


28. They went (ézopevovro). Imperfect, were going. So 
Rev. 


Made as though (spoceroujoato). The verb means origi- 
nally to add or attach to; hence to take to one’s self what does 
not belong to him; and s0, to pretend ; though pretending as 
implying anything false, does not attach to this act of Jesus. 
He was going on, and would have gone on but for their invita- 
tion. Only here in New Testament. 


29. They constrained (aapeBiacavt0). Contrary to (rapa) 
his apparent intention of goingon. Only here and Acts xvi. 15. 


Is far spent («é«duxev). Lit., has declined. Wyc., 1s now 
bowed down. 


30. And gave (ézreSiSov). A very beautiful use of the im- 
perfect, indicating that while he was in the act of distributing 
they recognized him. He blessed, and having broken, was giv- 
ing it to them, when, in an instant, their eyes were opened 
(aorist tense). 


31. They knew (érréyvwoav). Clearly recognized. 


And he vanished out of their sight (atdros ddavtos éyévero 
ar avtav). Lit., he, invisible, became away from them. It is 
not simply, he suddenly departed from them, but he passed 
away from them invisibly. The éyévero, became, is construed 
with am’ avrav, from them.* 





* Not &avros abrots, became invisible to them, which would imply that his 
body remained, but invisibly ; but ax airav, away from them, implying a real 
removal (Beza, cited by Alford and Meyer).

Lord rose and appeared. So Wye. See on appeared, ch.

reason about a matter which your spiritual perception ought to 
discern at once.” Compare note on fools, ver. 25.* 


39. Handle (nAradijoate). Compare 1 John i.1. The 
word occurs also Acts xvii. 27; Heb. xii. 18. “It never ex- 
presses the so handling an object as to exercise a moulding, 
modifying influence upon it, but at most a feeling of its sur- 
face; this, it may be, with the intention of learning its com- 
position (Gen. xxvii. 12, 21, 22); while, not seldom, it signifies 





* Reasonings, doubtings, scruples, are more or less distinctly implied in every 
occurrence of the word in the New Testament. In Phil. ii. 14, disputings (Rev. ) 
is, as Meyer observes, unsuitable to the reference of murmurings to God, and 
means rather scrupulous considering or hesitations, indicating uncertainty in 
the consciousness of duty. So in 1 Tim. ii. 8, the A. V. doubting is better. 
Rom. xiv. 1, is decisions of doubts (Rey., margin) or scruples. So Meyer, Godet, 
Lange, Beet, Shedd, Hodge, Tholuck, Alford, De Wette.

nobility and wealth.

THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 





CHAPTER I. 


1. The former (Tov wp@rov). Lit., the first. Luke refers to 
his Gospel. 


Treatise (Acyov). Or narrative. 


Began (jpEaro). This is interpreted in two ways. Lither, 
(1), as a simple historical statement equivalent to “all that Jesus 
did and taught.” In favor of this is the fact that the synoptists 
often record that which is done or said according to its moment 
of commencement, thus giving vividness to the account. See 
Matt. xi. 20; xxvi. 22,37; Mark vi. 7; xiv. 19; Luke vii. 38, 
ete. According to this explanation the word serves “to recall 
to the recollection from the Gospel all the several incidents and 
events, up to the ascension, in which Jesus had appeared as 
doer and teacher” (Meyer). Or, (2), as indicating that the Gos- 
pel contains the beginning, and the Acts of the Apostles the 
continuation, of the doings and teachings of Jesus. ‘‘The 
earthly life of Jesus, concluded with the ascension, has its 
fruit and continued efficacy ; and his heavenly life, commencing 
with the ascension, has its manifestation and proof in the acts 
and experiences of the apostles and first churches. The history 
of the Church was under the immediate control of the exalted 
Redeemer, and may justly be considered as the continuation in 
heaven of the work which he had begun on earth” (Baum- 
garten and Gloag). While the truth and importance of this 
statement are admitted, it is objected that such an intention on 


442 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca. L 


Luke’s part would have been more clearly intimated, and not 
left to be inferred from a single doubtful phrase. As regards 
Luke’s intention, I think the first explanation is more likely to 
be correct. The second, however, states a truth, the value and 
importance of which cannot be overestimated, and which should 
be kept in mind constantly in the study of the book of Acts. 
This is well put by Bernard (“ Progress of Doctrine in the New 
Testament,” Lect. IV.): “Thus the history which follows is 
linked to, or (may I not rather say) welded with, the past ; and 
the founding of the Church in the earth is presented as one 
continuous work, begun by the Lord in person, and perfected 
by the same Lord through the ministryof men. . . . ‘The 
former treatise’ delivered to us, not all that Jesus did and 
taught, but ‘all that Jesus began to do and teach wntd the day 
when he was taken up.’ The following writings appear in- 
tended to give us, and do, in fact, profess to give us, that which 
Jesus continued to do and teach after the day in which he was 
taken up.” 


2. Had given commandment (évre:Adpevos). Special in- 
junctions or charges. Compare Matt. iv.6; Mark xiii. 34; 
Heb. xi. 22. 


Through the Holy Ghost. Construe with had given com- 
mandment : by means of the Holy Spirit, which inspired him. 
Not, as some interpreters, with whom he had chosen. 


3. Shewed himself (zrapéctncev). This verb is rendered in 
a variety of ways in the New Testament, as give or furnish, pre- 
sent, provide, assist, commend. The original meaning is to place 
beside, and so commend to the attention. Hence, to set before 
the mind ; present, shew. 


Infallible proofs (rexwmpiois). The word is akin to réxuap, 
a fixed boundary, goal, end ; and hence a fiaed or sure sign or 
token. The Rev. omits infallible, probably assuming that a 
proof implies certainty. 


Cu. L] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 443 


Being seen (d7tavouevos). Only here in New Testament. 
Rev., appearing. 


Forty days (60 sjepav teccepdxovta). Lit., “through forty 
days.” Rev., by the space of. The only passage where the in- 
terval between ¢he resurrection and the ascension is given. 


4. Being assembled together (cuvadifouevos). From ovv, 
together, and adrs, thronged or crowded. Both the A. V. and 
Rey. give eating together in margin, following the derivation 
from ovv, together, and dds, salt: eating salt together, and 
hence generally of association at table. 


Commanded (vrapyyyerev). Originally to pass on or trans- 
mit; hence, as a military term, of passing a watchword or 
command ; and so generally to command. 


To wait for (vrepyéve). Only here in New Testament. 


The promise (érayyeriav). Signifying a free promise, given 
without solicitation. This is the invariable sense of the word 
throughout the New Testament, and this and its kindred and 
compound words are the only words for promise in the New 
Testament. ‘Trucyvéowas, meaning to promise in response to a 
request, does not occur; and oporoyéw, Matt. xiv. 7, of Herod 
promising Salome, really means to acknowledge his obligation 
for her lascivious performance. See note there. 


Not many days hence (ov peta moddds tavTas nuépas). 
Lit., not after many of these days. Not after many, but after a 


Sew. 


6. Asked (érnpotwv). The imperfect, denoting the repeti- 
tion and urging of the question. 


7. The times—the seasons (ypdvovs—xazpods). Rev. prop- 
erly omits the article. The former of these words, teme abso-

lutely, without regard to circumstances; the latter, definite pe- 
riods, with the idea of fitness. 


His own (7 iSia). Stronger than the simple possessive pro- 
noun. The adjective means private, personal. Often used ad- 
verbially in the phrase «ar’ iStav, apart, privately. See Matt. 
KViloe eo eX RI VIO: 


8. Unto me (yor). The best texts read pov, of me, or, as 
Rev., my witnesses. 


Samaria. Formerly they had been commanded not to enter 
the cities of the Samaritans (Matt. x. 5). 


10. Looked steadfastly (arevifovres Hoav). Seeon Luke iv. 20. 


12. A Sabbath-day’s journey (ca8Bdrov éxov odor). Lit., 
having a Sabbath’s way. The way conceived as belonging to 
the mountain ; connected with it in reference to the neighbor- 
hood of Jerusalem. A Sabbath-day’s journey, according to 
Jewish tradition, was about three-quarters of a mile. It was 
the supposed distance between the camp and the tabernacle in 
the wilderness (Josh. iii. 4). 


13. An upper room (76 trep@ov). With the article, de- 
noting some well-known place of resort. It was the name given 
to the room directly under the flat roof. Such rooms were 
often set apart as halls for meetings. In such an apartment 
Paul delivered his farewell address at Troas (Acts xx. 8), and 
the body of Dorcas was laid (Acts ix. 37). Used by Luke only. 


Abode (joav catapévovres). The participle and finite verb, 
denoting continuance or habitual residence. Hence more cor- 
rectly, as Rev., “ where they were abiding.” 


14. Continued (jjcav mpockaprepodvres). Participle and 
finite verb, as above. The verb is from xaprtepds, strong, 


stanch, and means originally to persist obstinately in. In this

sense here, and in Rom. xii. 12; xiii. 6. Hence to adhere firmly 
to. So in Mark iii. 9, “that a small ship should wazt on hom ;” 
Le., keep near at hand. The idea of steady persistence is sup- - 
plied by the Rev., steadfastly.

Obtained (Zrayxe). Strictly, “received by lot.” Rev., better,

public magistracies. 


Part (rdv cXjpov). The A. V. does not give the force of the 
article, the lot which was his. So Rev., “Acs portion:” lit., 
lot. 


Ministry. See on minister, Matt. xx. 26. Compare bish- 
opric, ver. 20. 


18. Purchased (éerjoato). See on possess, Luke xviii. 12. 
Better, as Rev., obtained. Judas did not purchase the field, but 
the priests did with the money which he returned to them 
(Matt. xxvii. 7). The expression means merely that the field 
was purchased with the money of Judas. 


Falling headlong (mpnvijs yevouevos). Lit., having become 
headlong. 


He burst asunder (é€Adeyoe). Only here in New Testa- 
ment. Lit., to crack, to burst with a noise. So Homer, of the 
bones cracking beneath a blow (“Iliad,” xiii., 616). Compare 
Aristophanes, “ Clouds,” 410. 


19. Aceldama. Or, more properly, Akeldamach. The word 
is Aramaic, the language then spoken in Palestine. 


20. Habitation (éravdis). Only here in New Testament. 
The word is used in classical Greek of a place for cattle. So 
Herodotus (i., 111): “ The herdsman took the child in his arms, 
and went back the way he had come, till he reached the fold” 
(éravaw). Also of a farm-building, a country-house. 


Bishopric (éaucxomnv). See on 1 Pet. ii. 12. Rev., better,

Acts ii. 32.

New Testament. See on counteth, Luke xiv. 28.

CHAPTER JI. 


1. Was fully come (cupmrdAnpodcIar). Used by Luke only. 
See on Luke ix. 51. Lit., as Rev., margin, was being fulfilled. 
The day, according to the Hebrew mode, is conceived as a 
measure to be filled up. So long as the day had not yet ar- 
rived, the measure was not full. The words denote i process 


of fulfilment. 


Pentecost. Meaning fiftieth ; because occurring on the fif- 
tieth day, calculated from the second day of unleavened bread. 
In the Old Testament it is called the feast of weeks, and the 
feast of harvest. Its primary object was to thank God for the 
blessings of harvest. See Deut. xvi. 10, 11. 


With one accord (opoSvpadiv). The best texts substitute 
pod, together. So Rev. 


9. A sound (7jxos). See on Luke iv. 37. 


Of a rushing mighty wind (depopuévns mvojs Biaias).  Lit., 
of a mighty wind borne along. TIvon is a blowing, a blast. 
Only here and ch. xvii. 25. Rev., as of the rushing of a mighty 
wind, 


The house. Not merely the room. Compare ch. i. 13. 
Were sitting. Awaiting the hour of prayer. See ver. 15. 
3. There appeared. See on Luke xxii. 43. 


Cloven tongues (Staepifopevar yX@ooat). Many prefer to 
render tongues distributing themselwves, or being distributed among 
the disciples, instead of referring it to the cloven appearance of 
each tongue. Rev., tongues parting asunder. 


Cx. IL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 449 
Like as of fire. Not consisting of fire, but resembliny (acel). 


It sat. Note the singular. One of these luminous appear- 
ances sat upon each. 


4. Began. Bringing into prominence the jirst impulse of the 
act. See on began, ch. i. 1. 


With other tongues (érépaus yAwooais). Strictly different, 
from their native tongues, and also different tongues spoken by 
the different apostles. See on Matt. vi. 24. 


Gave (€dé60v). A graphic imperfect; kept giving them the 
language and the appropriate words as the case required from 
time to time. It would seem that each apostle was speaking 
to a group, or to individuals. The general address to the mul- 
titude followed from the lips of Peter. 


Utterance (amopdéyyec3ar). Used only by Luke and in the 
Acts. Lit., to utter. A peculiar word, and purposely chosen to 
denote the clear, loud utterance under the miraculous impulse. 
It is used by later Greek writers of the utterances of oracles or 
seers. Soin the Septuagint, of prophesying. See 1 Chron. xxv. 
1; Deut. xxxii. 2; Zech. x. 2; Ezek. xiii. 19. 


5. Dwelling (xatocxodytes). Denoting an abiding; but 
here it must be taken in a wide sense, since among these are 
mentioned those whose permanent residence was in Mesopo- 
tamia, etc. See ver. 9. 


Devout. See on Luke ii. 25. 


6. When this was noised abroad (yevoyévns 5€é Ths davis

so that confound (Latin, confundere) is the most literal render-

ing possible. Used only by Luke and in the Acts. Compare 
Kix, 02; XXi. ol. 


Heard (jxovov). Imperfect, were hearing. 


Language (dvadéxt@). Rather, dialect ; since the foreign- 
ers present spoke, not only different languages, but different da- 
lects of the same language. The Phrygians and Pamphylians, 
for instance, both spoke Greek, but in different idioms; the 
Parthians, Medes, and Elamites all spoke Persian, but in differ- 
ent provincial forms. 


7. Amazed and marvelled (é&ctavro xai é9atvpafov). The 
former word denotes the first overwhelming surprise. The verb 
is literally to put owt of place ; hence, out of one’s senses. Com- 
pare Mark iii. 21: “He zs beside himself.” The latter word, 
marvelled, denotes the continuing wonder; meaning to regard 
with amazement, and with a suggestion of beginning to specu- 
late on the matter. 


Galilaeans. Not regarded as a sect, for the name was not 
given to Christians until afterward ; but with reference to their 
nationality. They used a peculiar dialect, which distinguished 
them from the inhabitants of Judaea. Compare Mark xiv. 
70. They were blamed for neglecting the study of their lan- 
guage, and charged with errors in grammar and ridiculous mis- 
pronunciations. 


9. Parthians, Medes, and Elamites. Representing portions 
of the Persian empire. 


Judaea. The dialect of Galilee being different from that of 
Judaea. 


Asia. Not the Asiatic continent nor Asia Minor. In the 
time of the apostles the term was commonly understood of the 
proconsular province of Asia, principally of the kingdom of 
Pergamus left by Attalus III. to the Romans, and including 


Cu. IL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 451 


Lydia, Mysia, Caria, and at times parts of Phrygia. The name 
Asia Minor did not come into use until the fourth century of 
our era. 


10. Egypt. Where the Jews were numerous. Two-fifths 
of the population of Alexandria were said to have been Jews. 


Cyrene. In Libya, west of Egypt. 


Strangers (émSnuodvtes). See onl Pet.i.1. Rev., rightly, 
SOJOUTNETS. 


11. Arabians. Whose country bordered on Judaea, and 
must have contained many Jews. 


Speak (AadotvvTwv). Rev., rightly, gives the force of the 
participle, speaking. 


Wonderful works (eyaneia). See on majesty, 2 Pet. i. 16. 
From péyas, great. Rev., mighty works. Used by Luke only. 


12. Were in doubt (Sunropouv). Used by Luke only. See

17. All flesh. Without distinction of age, sex, or condition. 
Visions (opdceus). Waking visions. 


Dream dreams (évirrvia evurruiacSjcovtas). The best texts

Wonders (tépata). Or portents. See on Matt. xi. 20. 
Signs. See on Matt. xi. 20. 


20. That great and notable day of the Lord come. The 
Rev. heightens the emphasis by following the Greek order, the 
day of the Lord, that great and notable day. Notable (émipavi) 
only here in New Testament. The kindred noun émiddveca, 
appearing (compare our word Epiphany), is often used of the 
second coming of the Lord. See 1 Tim. vi. 14; 2 Tim. iv. 1; 
Tite tale:

Crucified (poomnEavres). Only here in New Testament. 
The verb simply means to affia to or on anything. The idea of 
the cross is left to be supplied. 


Have slain (dveidere). See on Luke xxiii. 32. Rev., ren- 
dering the aorist more closely, dd slay. 


24, Pains (Sivas). The meaning is disputed. Some claim 
that Peter followed the Septuagint mistranslation of Ps. xviii. 
5, where the Hebrew word for snares is rendered by the 
word used here, pains ; and that, therefore, it should be ren- 
dered snares of death ; the figure being that of escape from the 
snare of a huntsman. Others suppose that death is represented 
in travail, the birth-pangs ceasing with the delivery ; 2.¢., the 
resurrection. This seems to be far-fetched, though it is true 
that in classical Greek the word is used commonly of birth- 
throes. It is better, perhaps, on the whole, to take the expres- 
sion in the sense of the A. V., and to make the pais of death 
stand for death generally. 


25. |foresaw (mpowpounv). Not to see beforehand, but to 
see before one’s self, as in Ps. xvi. 8. 


1 should not be moved (47 cadev9a). Or be shaken.

Suffer (8a@ces). Lit., give. 


29. Let me speak (é£dv etreiv). Lit., at 7s permitted me. 
Rev., Jmay. It is allowable for him to speak, because the 
facts are notorious. 


Freely (wera srappynoias). Lit., with freedom. The latter 
word from 7rav, all, and phats, speech ; speaking everything, and 
therefore without reserve. 


The patriarch (artpidpyov). From dpye, to begin, and 
matpid, a pedigree. Applied to David as the father of the 
royal family from which the Messiah sprang. It is used in the 
New Testament of Abraham (Heb. vii. 4), and of the sons of 
Jacob (Acts vii. 8). 


He is dead and buried (éredevtnce Kal érddn). Aorists, de- 
noting what occurred at a definite past time. Rev., rightly, he 


both died and was buried. 


His sepulchre is with us. Or among us (év fyiv). On 
Mount Zion, where most of the Jewish kings were interred in 
the same tomb.

36. Assuredly (ado¢adas). From a, not, and cdddda, to 
cause to fall. Hence, jirmly, steadfastly. 


37. They were pricked (xareviynoav). Only here in New 
Testament. The word does not occur in profane Greek. It is 
found in the Septuagint, as Gen. xxxiv. 7, of the grief of the 
sons of Jacob at the dishonor of Dinah. See, also, Ps. cix. (Sept. 
evili.) 16: “broken in heart.” The kindred noun xatdvvéss 
occurs Rom. xi. 8, in the sense of slwmber (Rev., stupor). 
Compare Isa. xxix. 10. See, also, Ps. lx. (Sept. lix.) 3: ofvoy 
katavvéews, the wine of astonishment (Rev., wine of staggering). 
The radical idea of the word is given in the simple verb vicca, 
to prick with a sharp point. So Homer, of the puncture of a 
spear ; of horses dinting the earth with their hoofs, ete. Here, 
therefore, of the sharp, painful emotion, the st¢ng produced by 
Peter’s words. Cicero, speaking of the oratory of Pericles, says 
that his speech left stings in the minds of his hearers (‘‘ De

Remission. See on Luke iii. 3; Jas. v. 15. 


39. Afar off (eis paxpav). Lit., unto a long way. Referring 
probably to the Gentiles, who are described by this phrase both 
in the Old and New Testaments. See Zech. vi. 15; Eph. ii. 
11-13. Peter knew the fact that the Gentiles were to be re- 
ceived into the Church, but not the mode. He expected they 
would become Christians through the medium of the Jewish re- 
ligion. It was already revealed in the Old Testament that they 
should be received, and Christ himself had commanded the 
apostles to preach ¢o all nations.

Shall call (rpooxaréontas). Rev. gives the force of mpos, 
to: “shall call wnto hum.”

Did he testify (S:euaprupero). The preposition d:4 gives the 
force of solemnly, earnestly. 


Save yourselves (c@Jnte). More strictly, be ye saved. 


Untoward (cxodds). Lit., crooked. Toward in earlier 
English meant docile, apt. The opposite is froward (from- 
ward). So Shakespeare : 


‘Tis a good hearing when children are toward, 
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.” 
Taming of the Shrew, v., 2. 


‘Spoken like a toward prince.” 
3 Henry VI, ii., 2. 


Untoward, therefore, meant intractable, perverse. So Shake- 
speare : 


‘¢ What means this scorn, thou most wntoward knave ?” 
KK. John. 4, 1: 


‘¢ And if she be froward, 
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be wntoward.”

Compare Deut. xxxii. 5. 

42. Continued steadfastly. See on ch. i, 14. 

Doctrine (didayn). Better, teaching. 

Fellowship (xow@ria). From kowvds, common. A relation 
between individuals which involves a common interest and a 


mutual, active participation in that interest and in each other. 
The word answers to the Latin communio, from communis, 


Cu. IT.) THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 457 


common. Hence, sometimes rendered communion, as 1 Cor. x. 
16; 2 Cor. xiii. 14. Fellowship is the most common rendering. 
Thus Philip. 1.5: “your fellowship in the gospel,” signifying 
co-operation in the widest sense ; participation in sympathy, 
suffering, and labor. Compare 1 John i. 3, 6, 7. Occasionally 
it is used to express the particular form which the spirit of fel- 
lowship assumes ; as in Rom. xv. 26; Heb. xiii. 16, where it sig- 
nifies the giving of alms, but always with an emphasis upon the 
principle of Christian fellowship which underlies the gift. 


Breaking (xAdcev). Used by Luke only, and only in the 
phrase breaking of bread. The kindred verb «rdf or Krdo, 
to break, occurs often, but, like the noun, only of breaking 
bread. Hence used to designate the celebration of the Lord’s 
Supper. 


Prayers (pocevyais). Always of prayer toGod. Compare 
on dencess, prayers, Luke v. 33; and besought, Luke viii. 38. 


43. Fear (p0Bos). Not terror, but reverential awe: as Mark 
iv. 41; Luke vii. 16; 1 Pet. i. 17, ete. 


44. Common (xowa). Compare fellowship, ver. 42. 

45. Possessions (xtnuara). Landed property. 

Goods (idp£eus). Possessions in general ; movables. 

46. With one accord (cywoIvpyadov). See on Matt. xviii. 19. 

From house to house (xar oixov). Better, as Rev., at home, 
contrasted with im the temple. Compare Philem. 2; Col. iv. 
15; 1 Cor. xvi. 19. 

Did eat their meat (wereAduBavov tpodijs). Rev., take their 


food. Partake would be better, giving the force of peta,

Singleness (a4geddrnTt). Only here in New Testament. De- 
rived from a, not, and perrevs, stony ground. Hence of some 
thing semple or plain. 


47. Added (poceriter). Imperfect: kept adding. 


Such as should be saved (rods cwfopévous). Lit., as Rev., 
those that were being saved. The rendering of the A. V. would 
require the verb to bein the future, whereas it is the present 
participle. Compare 1 Cor. i. 18. Salvation is a thing of the 
present, as well as of the past and futwre. The verb is used in 
all these senses in the New Testament. Thus, we were saved 
(not are, as A. V.), Rom. viii. 24; shadl or shalt be saved, Rom. x. 
9,13; ye are beg saved, 1 Cor. xv. 2.“ Godliness, righteous- 
ness, is life, is salvation. And it is hardly necessary to say that 
the divorce of morality and religion must be fostered and en- 
couraged by failing to note this, and so laying the whole stress 
either on the past or on the future—on the first call, or on the 
final change. It is, therefore, important that the idea of salva- 
tion as a rescue from sin, through the knowledge of God in 
Christ, and therefore a progressive condition, a present state, 
should not be obscured, and we can but regret such a translation 
as Acts ii. 47, ‘The Lord added to the church daily such as 
should be saved,’ where the Greek implies a different idea” 
(Lightfoot, “On a Fresh Revision of the New Testament”). 


To the church. See on Matt. xvi. 18.

11. The lame man which was healed. The best texts 
omit. Render as he held. 


Held (xpatodvros). Held them jirmly, took fast hold. The 


verb from xpdtos, strength. 


Greatly wondering (éJayBor). Wondering owt of measure 
(éx). Compare wonder (ver. 10). 


12. He answered. ‘The question expressed in the people’s 
explanations of surprise. 


Men of Israel. Lit., men, Jsraelites. An honorable and 
conciliatory form of address. The term Israelite gradually 
gave place to that of Jew, but Israel was the sacred name for 
the Jews, as the nation of the theocracy, the people under God’s 
covenant, and hence was for the Jew his especial badge and 
title of honor. “To be descendants of Abraham, this honor 
they must share with the Ishmaelites ; of Abraham and Isaac, 
with the Edomites ; but none except themselves were the seed 
of Jacob, such as in this name of Israelite they were declared to 
be. Nor was this all, but more gloriously still, their descent 
was herein traced up to him, not as he was Jacob, but as he was

Israel, who, as a prince, had power with God and with men, 
and had prevailed” (Trench, “ Synonyms”). So Paul, in 
enumerating to the Philippians his claims to have confidence in 
the flesh, says he was “ of the stock of Jsraed.” It is said that 
the modern Jews in the East still delight in this title. 


Our own (idia). See on ch. i. 7. 


13. His son (aida). Rightly, servant, as Rev. See on 
Lukei. 54. The A. V. renders, in Matt. xii. 18, servant, quot- 
ing from Isa. xlii. 1; but elsewhere, where applied to Jesus, 
son or child, which Rev. in every case has changed to servant. 
The word is continually used, like the Latin wer, in the sense 
of servant, and in the Septuagint as the servant of God. See 2 
Sam. vii. 5, 8, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26. Compare Luke i. 69. The 
term servant of Jehovah, or servant of the Lord, is applied in 
the Old Testament (1) to a worshipper of God, Neh. i. 10; 
Dan. vi. 21; so to Abraham, Ps. cv. 6,42; to Joshua, Josh. 
xxiv. 29; to Job, Jobi. 8. (2) To a minister or ambassador 
of God called to any service, Isa. xlix. 6; of Nebuchadnezzar, 
Jer. xxvii. 6; of the prophets, Amos iii. 7; of Moses, Deut. 
xxxiv. 5. (8) Peculiarly of the Messiah, Isa. xlii. 1; lii. 13; 
as God’s chosen servant for accomplishing the work of re- 
demption. ‘Unless we render servant in the passages where 
the phrase zrais @eod occurs in the New Testament, there will 
be no allusion throughout it all to that group of prophecies 
which designate the Messiah as the servant of Jehovah, who 
learned obedience by the things which he suffered” (Trench, 
“On the Authorized Version of the New Testament ”). 


When he. ZZ is éxe(vov, the pronoun of more definite and 
emphatic reference, the latter, Pilate, “ in order to make the 
contrast felt between what Pilate judged and what they did.” 
This is further emphasized in the next verse. 


14. Desired (Ar#jcac3e). Or demanded. See on Luke xi. 9. 


A murderer (dvdpa govéa). Lit., @ man who was a mur- 
derer. 


462 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. IIL 


To be granted (yapuoIjvat). By way of favor (xapos). 


15. The Prince of life (a4pynyov ris Gos). The Greek brings 
out by the position of these words what Bengel calls “ the mag- 
nificent antithesis ” between a murderer and the Prince of life. 
“Ye demanded a murderer, but the Prince of life ye killed.” 
This is the only place where the phrase occurs. “Apynyos, 
though sometimes rendered prince, means, primarily, beginning, 
and thence originator, author. Better here as Rev., in margin, 
author, and so by Rev. at Heb. ii. 10; xii. 2. 


16. Through faith (él 77 wicre). Note the article: the 
faith which we had; not the cripple’s faith, which was not de- 
manded as a condition of his cure. Through faith (és) is 
rather on account of, or on the basis of. Rev., by. Compare 
ch. ii, 88; and see on Matt. xxviii. 19. 


Made strong (éorepéwoe), See on ver. 7. 
Ye see (Sewpeire). See on Luke x. 18. 


Perfect soundness (cAoxAnpiav). Only here in New Testa- 
ment. From énos, entire, and Kdjpos, a lot. Denoting, there- 
fore, the condition of one who has his entire allotment. 


19. Be converted (érvotpépare). Not a good rendering, 
because the verb is in the active voice. Better as Rev., turn 
again. See on Luke xxii. 32. 


Blotted out (é£arepdjvar). Forgiveness of sins under the 
figure of the erasure of hand-writing. The word is used thus 
in Ps. li. (Sept. 1.), 1; Isa. xliii. 25. Also at Col. ii. 14. In 
classical Greek the verb is opposed to éyypddevv, to enter a name. 
So Aristophanes: “They do things not to be borne, entering 
(éyypapovres) some of us, and others, erasing (eEanrelpovtes) 
up and down, twice or thrice” (‘“ Peace,” 1180). More espe- 
cially with reference to an item in an account.

Of refreshing (dvayvéews). Only here in New Testament. 
The word means cooling, or reviving with fresh air. Compare 
the kindred verb, to wax cold, Matt. xxiv. 12, and see note. 


Presence (pocwov). Lit., the face. 


20. Which before was preached (tov mpoxexnpuypévor). 
But the best texts read wpoxeyeipicpévov, appointed. Compare 
ch. xxii. 14. Used by Luke only, ch. xxii. 14; xxvi. 16. The 
verb originally means to take in hand. 


21. Of restitution (aoxatactdcews). Only here in New 
Testament. The kindred verb, to restore, occurs Matt. xvii. 11; 
Acts i. 6, etc. As a technical medical term, it denotes complete 
restoration of health ; the restoring to tts place of a dislocated 
jownt, ete. 


Since the world began (dz aidvos). The American Re-

25. Covenant (dsaInnns). See on Matt. xxvi. 28. 


Made (évé9er0). The Rev. gives covenanted in margin. The 
noun covenant is derived from the verb duati9nws, originally to 
distribute or arrange. Hence to arrange or settle mutually; to 
make a covenant with.

servant for son, and see on ver. 13. 


464. WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. IV. 


CHAPTER IV. 


1. Captain of the temple. It was the duty of the Levites 
to keep guard at the gates of the temple, in order to prevent 
the unclean from entering. To them the duties of the temple- 
police were entrusted, under the command of an official known 
in the New Testament as “the captain of the temple,” but in 
Jewish writings chiefly as “the man of the temple mount.” Jo- 
sephus speaks of him as a person of such consequence as to be 
sent, along with the high-priest, prisoner to Rome. 


Came upon (éréarncav). Or stood by them, suddenly. Com- 
pare Luke xxiv. 4; Acts xxii. 20; xxiii. 11. Of dreams or 
visions, to appear to. 


2. Being grieved (Svarrovovpmevor). Only here and ch. xvi. 
18. The Rev. renders the force of dud by “sore troubled ;” 
vexed through and through. 


The resurrection. The Sadducees denied both the resur- 
rection and a future state. “In the Gospels the Pharisees are 
represented as the great opponents of Christ; in the Acts it 
is the Sadducees who are the most violent opponents of the 
apostles. ‘The reason of this seems to be, that in the Gospels 
Jesus Christ came in direct collision with the Pharisees, by 
unmasking their hypocrisies and endangering their influence 
among the people; whereas the apostles, in testifying to the 
resurrection of Christ, opposed the creed of the Sadducees. 
Perhaps, also, in attacking the apostles, who taught the resur- 
rection of that Jesus whom the Pharisees had persecuted and 
crucified, the Sadducees aimed an indirect blow at the favorite 
dogma of their rival sect” (Gloag, “ Commentary on Acts”). 


3. In hold (e¢s rypnow). A somewhat antiquated rendering. 
Better, as Rev., in ward. See on 1 Pet. i. 4. 


4. The number was about five thousand. Translate 
éyevndn as Rev., came to be; indicating the addition to the 
original number of the many that believed. 


Cu. IV.] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 465 


7. What power—what name. Lit., what sort of power; 
what kind of name. 


Have ye done. The ye closes the sentence in the Greek 
with a contemptuous emphasis: you people. 


12. Salvation (7 cwrnpia). Note the article: the salvation ; 
the Messianic deliverance. 


13. Boldness. See on freely, ch. ii. 29. 


Perceived (cataraPouevor). The word, meaning originally 
to seize upon or lay hold of, occurs frequently in the New Testa- 
ment in different phases of this original sense. Thus, to appre- 
hend or grasp, Eph. iii. 18; Philip. iii. 12, 18; Rom. ix. 30: 
of seizure by a demon, Mark ix. 18: of something coming upon 
or overtaking, John xii. 35; 1 Thess. v. 4: of comprehending, 
grasping mentally, as here, Acts x. 34; xxv. 25. 


Unlearned (aypduparor). Or, very literally, wndettered. With 
special reference to Rabbinic culture, the absence of which was 
conspicuous in Peter’s address. 


ignorant (édv@Tav). Originally, one in a private station, as 
opposed to one in office or in public affairs. Therefore one 
without professional knowledge, a layman; thence, generally, 
ignorant, ill-informed ; sometimes plebeian, common. In the 
absence of certainty it is as well to retain the meaning given by 
the A. V., perhaps with a slight emphasis on the want of pro- 
fessional knowledge. Compare 1 Cor. xiv. 16, 23, 24; 2 Cor. 
x 0 


Took knowledge (ézeyivwoxov). Or recognized. See on 
ch. iii. 10. 


15. Conferred (cvvéBarov). See on pondered, Luke ii. 19. 
17. It spread (Scaveund7). Only here in New Testament. 


Lit., be distributed. In 2 Tim. ii. 17, “ their word will eat as a

canker,” is, literally, w2ld have distribution or spreading (voynv 
&€ev). Bengel, however, goes too far when he represents the 
members of the council as speaking in the figure of a canker. 
‘“‘ They regard the whole as a canker.” 


18. To speak (¢3éyyec9ar). See on 2 Pet. ii. 16. 


21. Punish (xoAdowvra). Originally, to curtail or dock ; te 
prune as trees: thence to chech, keep im bounds, punish. 


24. Lord (Séo7rora). See on 2 Pet. ii. 1. 

25. Servant (zraidds). See on ch. iii. 13. 

Rage (é¢pvafav). Only here in New Testament. Origi- 
nally, to netgh or snort like a horse. Of men, to give one’s self 
haughty airs, and to act and speak insolently. Philo describes 
a proud man as “ walking on tiptoe, and bridling (ppvatropevos), 
with neck erect like a horse.” 

27. Didst anoint (éypscas). Seeon Christ, Matt. i. 1. 

28. Thy hand. Thy disposing power. 

32. Heart and soul. See on Mark xii. 30. 


33. Gave (dmedidovr). Lit., gave back (amo); as something 
which they were in duty bound to give. 


37. The money (70 ypfjua). The sum of money. 


CHAPTER YV. 


2. Kept back (évocdicaro). Only here, ver. 3, and Tit. ii. 
10, where it is rendered purloonig. From voodu, aloof, apart. 
The verb means to set apart for one’s self; hence to appropriate 
wrongfully. 


Cu. V.J THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 467 


3. To lie to (etcacSar). Rather, to decewe. The design 
of Satan was to decewe the Holy Ghost. Zo die to would re- 
quire a different case in the noun, which occurs in ver. 4, where 
the same verb is properly rendered Zze (unto God). Satan fills 
the heart to decewe. Theresult of the attempt is merely to de. 


4. Whiles it remained, was it not thine own (ovyi pévor ? 
coi éueve). A play on the words. Lit., remaining, did it not 
remain to thee? Rev., very happily, wheles ct remained, did it 
not remain thine own ? 


Conceived (é9ov). Lit., put or fiwed. Wherefore didst thou 
Jia this deed in thy heart ?—i.e., resolve upon tt. 


5. Gave up the ghost (é&éyuée). Used by Luke only. A 
rare word, occurring in the Septuagint, and in medical writers. 
See Ezek. xxi. 7, “ Every spirit shall faint.” See, also, on fazl- 
ing, Luke xxi. 26. 


6. Wound him up (cuvéctevAav). Better, as Rev., wrapped 
him round. The verb means to draw together, or draw in; 
hence used for shortening sail, reducing expenses, lowering or 
humbling a person. In 1 Cor. vii. 29, it occurs in the phrase, 
“the time is short (cuvectadpévos, Rev., properly, shortened) ;” 
i.e., drawn together, contracted. In the sense of wrapping up 
it is found in Aristophanes, of wrapping cloaks or garments 
about one; also of tucking up the garments about the loins, as a 
preparation for service. In the sense of shrouding for burial, 
it occurs in Euripides (“Troades,” 382): “They were not 
shrouded (avverectadyoar) by the hands of a wife.” In medical 
language, of bandaging a limb; of the contraction of tumors, 
and of organs of the body, etc. Some, however, as Meyer, 
refer the word here to the pressing together of the dead man’s 
limbs. 


8. Answered. ‘The woman, whose entrance into the as- 
sembly of the saints was like a speech” (Bengel). 


468 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca. V 


For so much (rogovrov). Perhaps pointing to the money 
still lying at his feet. 


9. Ve have agreed together (cuvedavyIn tpiv). The verb 
is passive. Lit., was et agreed by you. The figure in the word 
is that of concord of sounds. Your souls were attuned to each 
other respecting this deceit. See on muszc, Luke xv. 25. 


To tempt (etpdcar). To put it to the proof whether the 
Holy Spirit, ruling in the apostles, could be deceived. See on 
ver. 3. 


The feet. Graphic. The steps of the young men returning 
from the burial are heard at the door. 


12. Were wrought (éyévero). The best texts read éyiveto, 
the imperfect, were being wrought from time to time. 


All. The whole body of believers. 


13. The rest. Unbelievers, deterred by the fate of Ananias 
from uniting themselves to the church under false pretences. 


Join himself (ckoArNaoIaz). See on Luke xv. 15; x. 11. In 
all but two instances (Rom. xii. 9; 1 Cor. vi. 17), the word im- 
plies a forced, unnatural, or unexpected union. Thus Philip 
would not, without a special command, have “ joined himself ” 
to the chariot of the Ethiopian prince (Acts viii. 29). Saul’s 
attempt to join himself to the apostles was regarded by them 
with suspicion (Acts ix. 26); and the fact that certain persons 
“clave to” Paul in Athens is expressly contrasted with the 
attitude of the citizens at large. The sense of an unnatural 
union comes out clearly in 1 Cor. vi. 16. 


14. Were added (mpoceridevro). Imperfect: kept being 
added. 


15. Couches («paBBdtwv). See on Mark ii. 4.

The shadow of Peter passing by. But the proper ren-

18. In the common prison (év Tnpjoes Snpooig). Incorrect. 
Tiipnois is not used in the sense of prison, but is an abstract 
term meaning ward or keeping, as in ch. iv. 3. There is no 
article, moreover. Note, too, that another word is used for the 
prison in the next verse (rhs puvaxijs). Rev., therefore, cor- 
rectly, in public ward. 


19. By night (8a ris vueros). More correctly, during the 
night: dud, in the course of. Compare ch. xvi. 9. 


920. Stand. Compare ch. ii. 14; and see on Luke xviii. 11; 
xix. 8. 


Of this life. The eternal life which Christ revealed. It is 
a peculiar use of the phrase, which is commonly employed in 
contrast with the life to come, as 1 Cor. xv. 19. Compare John 
vi. 63, 68. Not equivalent ¢o these words of life. 


91. Early in the morning (i706 Tov SpSpov). “Ld, beneath, 
is often used in the sense of just about, or near. "OpSpov is from 
Spvupr, to cause to arise: the dawn, See on Luke xxiv. 1. Ren- 
der as Rev., about daybreak. 


Taught (é6/acxov). Imperfect: began teaching. 
The council (cuvédpuov). The Sanhedrim. 


The senate (yepovciav). From yépav, an old man, like the 
Latin senatus, from senex, old. ‘Taking on very early an offi- 
cial sense, the notion of age being merged in that of dignity. 
Thus in Homer yépovres are the chiefs who form the king’s 
council. Compare the Latin patres, fathers, the title used

in addressing the Roman senate. The word in this passage is 
the name of the Spartan assembly, Gerousia, the assembly of 
elders, consisting of thirty members, with the two kings. “The 
well-known term,” as Meyer remarks, “is fittingly transferred 
from the college of the Greek gerontes to that of the Jewish 
presbyters.” They summoned, not only those elders of the 
people who were likewise members of the Sanhedrim, but the 
whole council (add the senate) of the representatives of the people. 


Prison (Secuwrnpuov). Still another word for prison. Com- 
pare vv. 18,19. Rev., prison-house. The different words em- 
phasize different aspects of confinement. Trpnous is keeping, 
as the result of guarding. See onver.18. ®vdax7 emphasizes 
the being put under guard, and Secuwripiov the being put in 
bonds. 


22. Officers (j7npéras). See on Matt. v. 25.

We straitly charged. So Rev. (apayyedia Tapnyyeinapev). 
Lit., we charged you with a charge. See on Luke xxii. 15, with 
desire I have desired. 


Intend (Bovrec3e). Or ye want. See on willing, Matt. i. 19.

29. We ought (6e2). Stronger, we must. 


To obey (revSapyeiv). Not often used in the New Testament 
to express obedience, the most common word being brraxovw. 
Sometimes zre(9w is used. But this word, in itself, is the only 
one of the several in use which expresses the conception of 
obedience exclusively. ‘Ymaxovew is to obey as the result of /s- 
tening to another: meiMeoSas is to obey as the result of persua- 
sion. This is the special term for the obedience which one owes 
to authority (apy7). It occurs four times in the New Testament: 
Acts v. 29, 32; xxvii. 21; Tit. iii. 1; and in every case, of obedi- 
ence to established authority, either of God or of magistrates. 
In Acts xxvii. 21, where it is used of the ship’s officers hearken- 
ing to Paul’s admonition not to loose from Crete, Paul speaks 
of his admonition as divinely inspired ; compare xxvii. 10. In 
ch. iv. 19, Peter and John say hearken (axovew). That is a 
mere listening to or considering the proposition made to them. 
This is a deliberate course of action.

a pointedly foolish saying, which is witty or impressive through 
sheer contradiction or paradox, as laborious idleness, sublime 
indifference. In this case the apostles are described as dignt- 
Jied by indignity.

Grecians (EAAnuordv). Rev., much better, Grecian Jews, 
with Hellenists in margin. “Grecians” might easily be under- 
stood of Greeks in general. The word Hellenists denotes Jews, 
not Greeks, but Jews who spoke Greek. The contact of Jews 
with Greeks was first effected by the conquests of Alexander. 
He settled eight thousand Jews in the Thebais, and the Jews 
formed a third of the population of his new city of Alexandria. 
From Egypt they gradually spread along the whole Mediter- 
ranean coast of Africa. They were removed by Seleucus Nica- 
tor from Babylonia, by thousands, to Antioch and Seleucia, and 
under the persecutions of Antiochus Epiphanes scattered them- 
selves through Asia Minor, Greece, Macedonia, and the Aigean 
islands. The vast majority of them adopted the Greek lan- 
guage, and forgot the Aramaic dialect which had been their 
language since the Captivity. The word is used but twice in 
the New Testament—here and ch. ix. 29—and, in both cases, of 
Jews who had embraced Christianity, but who spoke Greek and 
used the Septuagint version of the Bible instead of the original 
Hebrew or the Chaldaic targum or paraphrase. The word 
“ExrAnv, Greek, which is very common in the New Testament, 
is used in antithesis, either to ‘ Barbarians” or to “ Jews.” In 
the former case it means all nations which spoke the Greek 
language (see Acts xviii. 17; Rom. i. 14; 1 Cor. i. 22, 23). In 


474 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VL 


the latter it is equivalent to Gentiles (see Rom. i. 16; TOs 
1 Cor. x. 32; Gal. ii. 3). Hence, in either case, it is wholly 
different from Hedlenist. 


Hebrews. Hebrew is the proper antithesis to Hellenist. A 
man was ‘Iovdaios, a Jew, who traced his descent from Jacob, 
and conformed to the religion of his fathers. He might speak 
Greek and be a Hellenist. He was ‘Efpatos, a Hebrew, only as 
he spoke Hebrew and retained Hebrew customs. The distinc- 
tion between Hebrew and Hellenist was a distinction within 
the Jewish nation, and not between it and other nations. Thus 
Paul calls himself a Hebrew of Hebrews ; i.e., a Hebrew and 
of Hebrew parents (Philip. iii. 5 ; compare 2 Cor. xi. 22).

and the other Greek. They were probably partly Hebrews and 
partly Hellenists. 


7. To the faith (77 méores). Opinions differ greatly as to 
whether this is to be taken as meaning facth in Jesus Christ, 
or faith considered as Christian doctrine—the Gospel ; the faith 
in the ecclesiastical sense. This passage and Gal. i. 23 are the 
strong passages in favor of the latter view; but the general 
usage of the New Testament, added to the fact that in both 
these passages the former meaning gives a good, intelligible, 
and perfectly consistent sense, go to confirm the former inter- 
pretation. 

1. In the great majority of New Testament passages fash 
is clearly used in the sense of faith in Jesus Christ: “the con- 
viction and confidence regarding Jesus Christ as the only and 
perfect mediator of the divine grace and of eternal life, through 
his work of atonement” (Meyer). 

2. This interpretation is according to the analogy of such 
expressions as obedience of Christ (2 Cor. x. 5), where the 
meaning is, clearly, obedience to Christ: obedcence of the truth 
(1 Pet. i. 22). Accordingly, faith, though it becomes in man 
the subjective moral power of the new life, regenerated through 
the power of the Spirit, is regarded objectively as a power—the 
authority which commands submission. 

3. This interpretation is according to the analogy of the ex- 
pression hearing of faith (Gal. iii. 2), which is to be rendered, 
not as equivalent to the reception of the Gospel, but as the report 
or message of faith; ie., which treats of faith, axon, hearing 
being always used in the New Testament in a passive sense, 
and often rendered fame, rumor, report (see Matt. iv. 24; xiv. 
1; Mark i. 28; John xii. 38; Rom. x. 16). Compare, also, obedv- 
ence of faith (Rom. i. 5; xvi. 26), where faith is to be taken 
as the object, and not as the source, of the obedience; and hence 
is not to be explained as the obedience which springs from 
faith, but as the obedience rendered to faith as the authoritative 
impulse of the new life in Christ. 

The great majority of the best modern commentators hold 


476 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. VL 


that faith is to be taken as the subjective principle of Christian 
life (though often regarded objectively as a spiritual power), 
and not as Chrestian doctrine. 


8. Did (éoée:). Imperfect: was working wonders during 
the progress of the events described in the previous verse. 


9. Synagogue. See on Church, Matt. xvi. 18. 


Of the libertines. In Jerusalem, and probably in other 
large cities, the several synagogues were arranged according to 
nationalities, and even crafts. Thus we have in this verse men- 
tion of the synagogues of the Cyrenians, Alexandrians, Cilicians, 
and Asiatics. ébertines is a Latin word (libertini, freedmen), 
and means here Jews or their descendants who had been taken 
as slaves to Rome, and had there received their liberty ; and 
who, in consequence of the decree of Tiberius, about 19 a.p., 
expelling them from Rome, had returned in great numbers to 
Jerusalem. They were likely to be the chief opponents of 
Stephen, because they supposed that by his preaching, their 
religion, for which they had suffered at Rome, was endangered 
in Jerusalem. 


10. They were not able (ov« icyvov). See on Luke xiv. 
30; xvi. 3. 


11. Suborned (i7éBadov). Only here in New Testament. 
The verb originally means to put wnder, as carpets under one’s 
feet; hence, to put one person in place of another ; to substi- 
tute, as another’s child for one’s own ; to employ a secret agent 
in ones place, and to instigate or secretly struct him. 


12. They stirred up the people (cvvexivnoay tov adr). 
The verb occurs only here in the New Testament. It implies 
to stir up as a mass, to move them together (cvv). This is the 
first record of the hostility of the people toward the disciples. 
See ch. ii. 47.

5. Inheritance («Anpovouiav). See on 1 Pet. i. 4. 


Not so much as to set his foot on (ovdé Bia Todds). Lit., 
not even the stepping of a foot. From the original meaning, a 
pace or step, which occurs only here in the New Testament, 
comes the sense of a step considered as a raised place or seat, 
and hence a tribune or judgment-seat, which is its meaning in 
every other passage of the New Testament. 


Possession (xatdoyeow). Only here and ver. 45. See on 
keep, Luke viii. 15. It denotes a permanent possession. 


8. The covenant of circumcision. There is no article,

12. In Egypt (é€ Atyirr@). But the best texts read eis 
Aiyurrrov, into Egypt, and construe with sent forth: “he sent 
forth our fathers into Lgypt.” 


13. Joseph’s race. Note the repetition of the name. “A 
certain sense of patriotic pride is implied in it.” 


14. Threescore and fifteen. Lit., “im (év) threescore and 
fifteen ;” the idiom expressing the sum 7% which all the in- 
dividuals were included. 


17. When (xaos). Rev., more correctly, as; the word 
being not a particle of tame, but meaning in proportion as. 


18. Another (érepos). Not merely a successor, but a monarch 
of a defferent character. 


Knew not. As sixty years had elapsed since Joseph’s 
death, and a new dynasty was coming to the throne, this may 
be taken literally: did not know his history and_ services. 
Some explain, did not recognize his merits. 


19, Dealt subtilely (catacodvoduevos). Only here in New 
Testament. Lit., to employ cunning against. See on coos, 
wise, Jas. ili. 13. 


So that they cast out (rod wrovety ExSera). Lit., make ew- 
posed. The verb éxréiInut, to set out, or place outside, is not 


Cu. VIL] THE AOTS OF THE APOSTLES. 479 


uncommon in classical Greek for the exposure of a new-born 
child. Thus Herodotus, of Cyrus, exposed in infancy: “The 
herdsman’s wife entreated him not to expose (é«Ieivas) the 
babe ” (i., 112). The rendering of the A. V., “so that they cast 
out,” is correct, expressing the vesw/¢, and not Pharaoh’s design. 


Young children (@pé¢n). Incorrect. See on 1 Pet. ii. 2. 
Rey., rightly, babes. 


Live (fwoyovetcdar). Or, be preserved alive. See on Luke 
xvii. 33. 


20. Time (xaipo). Better, season or juncture. “Sad, 
seasonable ” (Bengel). See on Acts i. 7. 


Exceeding fair (aotefos TO Oe). Lit., fair unto God: a 
Hebrew superlative. Compare Jon. ili. 3: great unto God; 
A. V., exceeding great. Gen. x. 9, of Nimrod: a mighty hunter 
before the Lord, 2 Cor. x.4: mighty unto God ; i.e. in God's 
sight. ’Acretos, fair (only here and Heb. xi. 23), is from aotu, 
a town, and means originally town-bred ; hence refined, elegant, 
comely. The word is used in the Septuagint of Moses (Exod. 
ii. 2), and rendered goodly. The Jewish traditions extol Moses’ 
beauty. Josephus says that those who met him, as he was car- 
ried along the streets, forgot their business and stood still to gaze 
at him. 


21. Took up (aveinkeTo). Used among Greek writers of taking 
up exposed children; also of owning new-born children. So 
Aristophanes: “I exposed (the child) and some other woman, 
having taken it, adopted (aveidero) it” (“ Clouds,” 531). There 
is no reason why the meaning should be limited to took hum 


up from the water (as Gloag). 


23. It came into his heart (dvéBn émi tHv Kapdlav).  Lit., 
“‘4¢ wrose into his heart.” “There may be something in the 
depth of the soul which afterward emerges and ascends from 
that sea into the heart as into an island” (Bengel). The ex- 


480 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VIE 


pression is imitated from the Hebrew, and occurs in the Sep- 
tuagint: “The ark shall not come to mind ,” lit., go up into 
the heart (Jer. iii. 16). See, also, Jer. xxxii. 85; Isa. lxv. 17. 


94. Defended (nutvaro). Only here in New Testament. 
The word means originally to ward off from one’s self, with a 
collateral notion of reguital or revenge. 


95. Understood (cvmévas). See on understanding, Mark 
xi. 33. 


26. Appeared (8697). With the suggestion of a sudden 
appearance as in a vision; possibly with the underlying notion 
of a messenger of God. See on Luke xxii. 43. 


Would have set them at one (cuv7jAacer avtods eis eipyynv). 
Lit., drove them together to peace ; wrged them.

32. Trembled (évtpopos yevopevos). Lit., having become 
trembling ; having fallen into a tremor. 


34. | have seen, I have seen (idav cidov), Lit., having 
seen I saw. A Hebraism. See Exod. iii. 7 (Sept.). Compare 
Judg. i. 28: utterly drive them out; lit., removing did not 
utterly remove. Judg.iv.9: gong I will go ; i.e., I will surely 
go. Gen. xxxvii. 8: reigning shalt thow reign ; i.e., shalt thou 
indeed reign. So Rev. here, “I have swrely seen.” 


35. Deliverer (Avtpwr7v). Strictly, a vansomer or redeemer. 
Only here in New Testament. See on ransom, Matt. xx. 28;

38. Lively. Better, living, as Rev. Compare 1 Pet. ii. 4, 5. 


39. Turned back in their hearts. Not desiring to go 
back, but longing for the idolatries of Egypt. 


40. Shall go before us. As symbols to be borne before 
them on the march. Compare Neh. ix. 18. 


41. They made a calf (éuooyorolnear). Only here in New 
Testament, and not in Septuagint. Bengel says, “A very noto- 
rious crime is denoted by an extraordinary and newly-coined 
word.” ‘This was in imitation of the Egyptian bull-worship. 
Several of these animals were worshipped at different places in 
Egypt. Apis was worshipped at Memphis. Herodotus says: 
“Now this Apis, or Epaphus, is the calf of a cow which is never 
afterward able to bear young. The Egyptians say that fire 
comes down from heaven upon the cow, which thereupon con- 
ceives Apis. The calf which is so called has the following 
marks: He is black, with a square spot of white upon his fore- 
head, and on his back the figure of an eagle. The hairs in his 
tail are double, and there is a beetle upon his tongue” (iii., 28). 
He was regarded by the Egyptians, not merely as an emblem, 
but as a god. He was lodged in a magnificent court, orna- 
mented with figures twelve cubits high, which he never quitted 
except on fixed days, when he was led in procession through 
the streets. His festival lasted seven days, and all came for- 
ward from their houses to weleome him as he passed. He was 
not allowed to reach the natural term of his life. If a natural 
death did not remove him earlier, he was drowned when he 
reached the age of twenty-five, and was then embalmed and 
entombed in one of the sepulchral chambers of the Serapeum, 
a temple devoted expressly to the burial of these animals. 

Another sacred bull was maintained at Heliopolis, in the great 
Temple of the Sun, under the name of Mnevis, and was hon- 

31 


482 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VIL 


ored with a reverence next to Apis. Wilkinson thinks that it 
was from this, and not from Apis, that the Israelites borrowed 
their notions of the golden calf. “The offerings, dancing, and 
rejoicings practised on the occasion, were doubtless in imitation 
of a ceremony they had witnessed in honor of Mnevis during 
their sojourn in Egypt ” (“ Ancient Egyptians,” 2 ser., vol. i1., 
p. 197). A third sacred bull, called Bacis, was maintained at 
Hermonthis, near Thebes. It was a huge, black animal, and 
its hairs were said to grow the wrong way. Other bulls and 
cows did not hold the rank of gods, but were only sacred. 


Offered (duyayov). Lit., led wp. See on Jas. li. 21. 


42. To worship (Aatpedev). Rev., more correctly, serve. 
See on Luke i. 74. 


The host of heaven. Star-worship, or Sabaeanism, the rem- 
nant of the ancient heathenism of Western Asia, which con- 
sisted in the worship of the stars, and spread into Syria, though 
the Chaldaean religion was far from being the simple worship 
of the host of heaven; the heavenly bodies being regarded as 
real persons, and not mere metaphorical representations of as- 
tronomical phenomena. It is to the Sabaean worship that Job 
alludes when, in asserting the purity of his life (xxxi. 26, 27), 
he says: “If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walk- 
ing in brightness, and my heart hath been secretly enticed, or 
my mouth hath kissed my hands: this also were an iniquity to 
be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God 
that is above.” Though not a part of the religion of the Egyp- 
tians, Rawlinson thinks it may have been connected with their 
earlier belief, since prayer is represented in hieroglyphics by 
a man holding up his hands, accompanied by a star (Herodo- 
tus, vol. ii., p. 291). 


43. Tabernacle of Moloch. The portable tent-temple of 
the god, to be carried in procession. Moloch was an Ammonite 
idol to whom children were sacrificed. According to Rabbini- 
cal tradition, his image was hollow, heated from below, with the 


Cu. VIL) THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 483 


head of an ox and outstretched arms, into which children were 
laid, their cries being stifled by the beating of drums. 


Remphan. The texts vary between Remphan, Rephan, and 
Romphan. It is supposed to be the Coptic name for Saturn, 
to which the Arabs, Egyptians, and Phoenicians paid divine 
honors. 


45. That came after (d:adeEdpevor). Only here in New Tes- 
tament. The verb originally means to recewe from one another, 
in succession ; and that appears to be the more simple and 
natural rendering here: having recewed it (from Moses). Rev., 
very neatly, in their turn. 


Jesus. Joshua. The names are the same, both signifying 
Saviour. See on Matt. i. 21. 


Into the possession (év 7H xatacyéces). Rev., when they 
entered on the possession.* 


Before the face (amd mpocwmov). More strictly, “away 
From the face.” The same expression occurs in the Septuagint, 
Deut. xi. 23. 


46. Desired (%7ycarT0). More correctly, asked: through 
Nathan. See 2 Sam. vii. 2. 


Tabernacle (cxjvopya). It was not a tabernacle or tent 
which David proposed to build, but a house. See 2 Sam. vii. 





* The A. V. apparently assumes that ev, im, stands for eis, into, which is in- 
admissible. The preposition may be explained as combining the ideas of en- 
trance into and subsequent rest ; and this seems to be the explanation adopted 
by the Rev. Alford’s rendering, at their taking possession of the Gentiles, is 
condemned by the fact that xardoxeois does not mean taking possession, but 
holding possession, which is clearly the meaning in ver. 5, the only other New 
Testament passage where it occurs, Meyer, in his anxiety to preserve the 
strict force of év, renders during the possession of the Gentiles, or while the Gen- 
tiles were in the state of possession, which, though grammatically defensible, I 
eannot help thinking forced and unnatural. On the whole, it seems best to 
hold by the rendering of the Rev.

2. Rev., rightly, habitation. Compare oixov, a house, ver. 47, 
and 2 Chron. vi. 18. 


48. The Most High. In contrast with heathen gods, who 
were confined to their temples. 


Temples made with hands (yeiporroujrous vaois). The best 
texts omit vaois, temples. The meaning is more general: a 
things made with hands. The expression is, however, used of a 
sanctuary in Isa. xvi. 12: “ Moab shall come to his sanctuary 
(ra yewporrointa).” The phrase work, or works of men’s hands, 
is common in the Old Testament of ¢dols. See Deut. iv. 28; 2 
Kings xix. 18; 2 Chron. xxxii.19; Ps. exv. 4. Compare Mark 
xiv. 55. Hpheim ii saben ix. 11,2452 Cor. -v. "1:

Resist (avririmtere). It is a very strong expression, imply-

falling upon an enemy. Only here in New Testament. 


Ve have been (yeyévyode). More correctly, as Rev., ye have

and emphasizing their sin by contrast with their privileges: in- 
asmuch as ye were those who recewed, ete. 


By the disposition of angels (els Suatayas dyyédwv). Lit., 
unto ordinances of angels. His means with reference to. Dis- 
position (Svarayn) is used by A. V. in the sense of arrangement, 
as we say a general disposed his troops. The word occurs only 
here and Rom. xiii. 2, where it is rendered ordinance. The 
kindred verb dvatadcow occurs often, and mostly in the sense 


Cu. VII] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 485 


of command or appoint. See Matt. xi. 1; Luke iii. 13. In 1 
Cor. xi. 34, it is translated set in order. The reference is most 
probably to the Jewish tradition that the law was given through 
the agency of angels. See Deut. xxxiii. 2. Compare Ps. Ixviii. 
17. Paul expressly says that the law was adminstered by the 
medium of angels (Gal. iii.19). Compare the word spoken by 
angels (Heb. ii. 2). Render, therefore, as Rev., as a was or- 
dained by angels. 


54. They were cut. See on ch. y. 33. In both instances, 
of anger. A different word is used to express remorse, ch. li. 87. 


Gnashed (é8pvyov). Originally to eat greedily, with a noise, 
as wild beasts: hence to gnash or grind the teeth. 


55. Being (tmdpywv). See on Jas. ii. 15. 


Looked up steadfastly. Compare ch. i. 103 ili. 4, 1235 vi. 
15; and see on Luke iv. 20. 


Standing. Rising from the throne to protect and receive 
his servant. Usually Jesus is represented in the New Testa- 
ment as seated at the Father’s right hand. See Eph. i. 20; 
Col. iii. 1; Heb. i. 3. 


56. I see (Sewpd). See on Luke x. 18. 


The Son of man. A title never applied to Christ by any 
of the apostles or evangelists, except here by Stephen. See on 
Luke vi. 22. 


57. Stopped (cuvécyov). Lit., held together. 


58. Stoned. According to the Rabbis, the scaffold to which 
the criminal was to be led, with his hands bound, was to be twice 
the size of aman. One of the witnesses was to smite him with 
a stone upon the breast, so as to throw him down. If he were 
not killed, the second witness was to throw another stone at

him. Then, if he were yet alive, all the people were to stone 
him until he was dead. The body was then to be suspended 
till sunset. 


A young man (veaviov). Which, however, gives no indica- 
tion of his age, since it is applied up to the age of forty-five. 
Thirty years after Stephen’s martyrdom, Paul speaks of him- 
self as the aged (Philem. 9). 


Saul. The first mention of the apostle to the Gentiles. 


59. Calling upon God. God is not in the Greek. From 
the vision just described, and from the prayer which follows, it

Jesus. An unquestionable prayer to Christ. 


60. Lay not this sin to their charge (ux) orjons avtois Thy 
dpaptiav tavTnv). Lit., fiw not this sin upon them. 


He fell asleep (éxovwn9n). Marking his calm and peaceful 
death. Though the pagan authors sometimes used sleep to 
signify death, it was only as a poetic figure. When Christ, on 
the other hand, said, ‘ Our friend Lazarus sleepeth (kexoiwnrat),” 
he used the word, not as a figure, but as the expression of a 
fact. In that mystery of death, in which the pagan saw only 
nothingness, Jesus saw continued life, rest, waking—the ele- 
ments which enter into sleep. And thus, in Christian speech 
and thought, as the doctrine of the resurrection struck its roots 
deeper, the word dead, with its hopeless finality, gave place to 
the more gracious and hopeful word sleep. The pagan burying- 
place carried in its name no suggestion of hope or comfort. It 
was a burying-place, a hiding-place, a monumentum, a mere 
memoreal of something gone; a columbarium, or dove-cot, with 
its little pigeon-holes for cinerary urns; but the Christian 
thought of death as sleep, brought with it into Christian speech 
the kindred thought of a chamber of rest, and embodied it in 
the word cemetery (Kotuntnpiov)—the place to lie down to sleep.

3. Made havoc (éAvyaiveto). Only here in New Testament. 
In Septuagint, Ps. Ixxix. 13, it is used of the laying waste of a 
vineyard by the wild boar. Compare Acts ix. 21, where the 
A. V. has destroyed, but where the Greek is tropIjcas, devas- 
tated. Canon Farrar observes: ‘“ The part which he played at 
this time in the horrid work of persecution has, I fear, been 
always underrated. It is only when we collect the separate 
passages—they are no less than eight in number—in which 
allusion is made to this sad period,* it is only when we weigh 
the terrible significance of the expressions used that we feel 
the load of remorse which must have lain upon him, and the 
taunts to which he was liable from malignant enemies” (“ Life 
and Work of St. Paul”). Note the imperfect, of continued 
action.

represented as a body (Col. ii. 19); and of love as the bond of 
perfectness (Col. iii. 14). See Isa. lviii. 6.

the only other passage where it occurs. Rev. gives at noon in 
margin. 


Desert. Referring to the route. On desert, see on Luke 
xv.4, There were several roads from Jerusalem to Gaza. One 
is mentioned by the way of Bethlehem to Hebron, and thence 
through a region actually called a desert. 


97, Of Ethiopia. The name for the lands lying south of 
Egypt, including the modern Nubia, Cordofan, and Northern 
Abyssinia. Rawlinson speaks of subjects of the Ethiopian 
queens living in an island near Meroé, in the northern part 
of this district. He further remarks: ‘The monuments prove 
beyond all question that the Ethiopians borrowed from Egypt 
their religion and their habits of civilization. They even 
adopted the Egyptian as the language of religion and of the 
court, which it continued to be till the power of the Pha- 
raohs had fallen, and their dominion was again confined to the 
frontier of Ethiopia. It was through Egypt, too, that Christi- 
anity passed into Ethiopia, even in the age of the apostles, as is 
shown by the eunuch of Queen Candace.” 


Of great authority (Suvdorns). A general term for a po- 
tentate. 


Candace. The common name of the queens of Meroé: a 
titular distinction, like Pharaoh in Egypt, or Caesar at Rome. 


Treasure (yas). Only here in New Testament. A Per- 
sian word.

30. Understandest thou what thou readest (apd ye yuva- 
oxes & avaywockes); The play upon the words cannot be 
translated. The interrogative particles which begin the ques- 


tion indicate a doubt on Philip’s part.

39. Caught away. Suddenly and miraculously. 


And he went, etc. (émropevero yap). A mistranslation. Rev., 
rightly, “for he went.” A reason is given for the eunuch’s 
seeing Philip no more. He did not stop nor take another road 
to seek him, but went on his way.

and so corresponding to against the disciples. 


Threatenings and slaughter (azeirjs Kal dévov). Lit.,

which these words are marks them as the cause or sowrce of the 
“breathing; ” breathing hard owt of threatening, and murderous 
desire.

2. Of this way (rfs 0500). Rev., more correctly, “the way.” 
A common expression in the Acts for the Christian religion: 
“the characteristic direction of life as determined by faith on 
Jesus Christ” (Meyer). See ch. xix. 9; xxii.4; xxiv. 22. For 
the fuller expression of the idea, see ch. xvi. 173; xviil. 25. 


Women. Paul three times alludes to his persecution of 
women as an aggravation of his cruelty (ch. viii, 3; ix. 25 


Xxli. 4). 


3. There shined round about (zepinotpayev). Only here 
and ch. xxii. 6. Flashed. See on Luke xi. 36; xxiv. 4.

of choice. On vessel, see on Matt. xii. 29; and on the figure, 
compare 2 Cor. iv. 7. 


16. How great things (dca). Rev., more correctly, how 
many. 


17. Brother. In Christ. 


Cu. IX.] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 493 


18. There fell—scales (amémecov—nrerldes). Both words 
occur only here in the New Testament. In Paul’s own account 
of his conversion in ch. xxvi. he does not mention his blindness : 
in ch. xxii. he mentions both the blindness and the recovery of 
sight, but not the particular circumstances which Luke records. 
The mention of the scales, or incrustations, such as are incidental 
to ophthalmia, is characteristic of the physician, and amor tr- 
rew, to fall off, was used technically by medical writers of the 
falling of scales from the skin, and of particles from diseased 
parts of the body. “We may suppose that Luke had often 
heard Paul relate how he felt at that moment ” (Hackett). 


20. Christ. The correct reading is Jesus, the individual or 
personal name of the Lord. Christ was not yet current as his 
personal name. Paul’s object was to establish the identity of 
Jesus the Nazarene with the Messiah. 


21. Destroyed (rop9jcas). Rather, lacd waste, made havoc 
of, as Rev. Compare ch. viii. 3. Paul uses the same word in 
Gal. i. 13. 


22. Confounded. See on ch. ii. 6. 


Proving (cupBiB8dfwv). The verb means to bring or put to- 
gether: hence to compare and examine, as evidence, and so to 
prove. Used in the literal and physical sense in Eph. iv. 16. 
In Col. ii. 2, of being knit together in love. In 1 Cor. ii. 16, of 
instructing, building up, by putting together. In this sense 
the word occurs in the Septuagint. See Levit. x. 11; Judg.

appellative. See on ver. 20. 


93. To kill. See on Luke xxiii. 32.

ever it occurs, viz., ch. xx. 3, 19; xxiii. 30; but properly

changed by Rev., in every case, to plot. “ Laying await” refers 
rather to the execution of the plot than to the plot itself. 


Watched. See on Mark iii. 2. Imperfect: they were or 
kept watching, day and night. 


25. By the wall (8:a rod tetyous). Rev., more accurately, 
through the wall, as is explained by 2 Cor. xi. 33. Either 
through the window of a house overhanging the wall, or through 
a window in the wall itself opening to houses on its inner side. 
Hackett says that he observed such windows in the wall at 
Damascus. On the mode of escape, compare Josh. i. 15; 1 
Sam. xix. 12. 


Basket (c7rupids). See on Matt. xiv. 20. In Paul’s account 
of this adventure he uses capydvn, a plaited or braided basket 
of wicker-work ; or, as some think, of ropes. 


26. Join himself. See on ch. v.13; Luke xv. 15; x. 11. 


27. Declared (dunyjcaro). Related throughout. See on 
Luke viii. 839; and compare on declaration, Luke i. 1. 


Had preached boldly (ézappnotdcaro). See on freely, ch.

Went about (ézreyelpouv). Better, attempted : lit., took in 
hand. 


31. The churches. The best texts read the church ; em- 
bracing all the different churches throughout the three prov- 


inces of Palestine. 


Edified. Or buclt up. 


Cu, IX.] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 495 


Comfort (zapaxdyjoe). From rapaxanréa, to call toward or to 
one’s side for help. The word is rendered in the New Testament 
both exhortation and consolation. Compare Acts xiii. 15 ; Rom. 
xii. 8; 2 Cor. viii. 17; Heb. xii. 5; and Luke ii. 25 (see note) ; 
2 Thess. ii. 16; Matt. v.4. In some passages the meaning is 
disputed, as Philip. ii. 1, where, as in 1 Cor. xiv. 3, it is joined 
With vapapvJvov or mapaputia, the meaning of which also varies 
between incentive and consolation or assuagement. Here ex- 
hortation is the rendering approved by the best authorities, to be 
construed with was multiplied: was multiplied by the exhorta- 
tion of the Holy Ghost; i.e., by the Holy Spirit inspiring the 
preachers, and moving the hearts of the hearers. 


32. Lydda. The Zod of the Old Testament (Ezra ii. 33); 
about a day’s journey from Jerusalem. 


33. Eight years. The duration of the malady, and the fact 
of his having been bedridden for the whole time, are character- 
istic of the physician’s narrative. 


Bed. See on Mark ii. 14. 


Sick of the palsy. Better, as Rev., palsied. See on Luke 
v. 18; 


34. Jesus Christ. But note the article: Jesus the Christ ; 
the Anointed ; Messiah. 


Maketh thee whole (iarai ae). Rev., healeth thee. See on 
Luke vi. 19. 


Make thy bed (ctpacov ceavto). Lit., strew for thyself. 
Not, henceforth, but on the spot, as an evidence of restoration. 


85. Saron. Rey., properly, Sharon. Always with the defi- 
nite article: the plain ; extending thirty miles along the sea 
from Joppa to Caesarea. 


496 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. X% 


36. Disciple (wadjtpia). A feminine form, only here in 
New Testament. 

Tabitha—Dorcas. The latter word being the Greek equiv- 
alent of the former, which is Aramaic, and meaning gazelle, 
which in the East was a favorite type of beauty. See Song of 
Solomon ii. 9, 17; iv. 5; vii. 3. It was customary at this 
time for the Jews to have two names, one Hebrew and the 
other Greek or Latin; and this would especially be the case in 


a seaport like Joppa, which was both a Gentile and a Jewish 
town. She may have been known by both names. 


37. Upper chamber. See on ch. i. 13. 

38. That he would not delay (2) dxvpcar). The best texts 
read dxvyoys, putting the request in the form of a direct ad- 
dress, Delay not. 

To come (dierdetv). Lit., to come through. Rev., come on. 

39. Coats and garments. See on Matt. v. 40.

posed to a fancy. 


4. When he looked (drevicas). Rev., more accurately, fas- 
tening his eyes. Compare ch. vii. 55; and see on Luke iv. 20. 


6. Atanner. Showing that the strictness of the Jewish law 
was losing its hold on Peter; since the tanner’s occupation was 
regarded as unclean by strict Jews, and the tanners were com- 
manded to dwell apart. “If a tanner married without men- 
tioning his trade, his wife was permitted to getadivorce. The 
law of levirate marriage might be set aside if the brother-in-law 
of the childless widow was a tanner. A tanner’s yard must be at 
least fifty cubits from any town ” (Farrar, “ Life and Work of 
St. Paul”). 


By the seaside. Outside the walls, both for proximity to 
the business, and because of the ceremonial requirement re- 
ferred to above. Mr. William C. Prime, describing a visit to 
Joppa, says: “I was walking along the sea-beach, looking for 
shells, and at about a fourth of a mile from the city, to the 
southward, I found two tanneries directly on the seaside. I ob- 
served that the rocks in front of them were covered with the 
water a few inches deep, and that they soaked their hides on 
these rocks, and also submitted them to some process in the

Holy Land ”). 


Of them that waited on him continually (pocxaptepovv- 
Tov avT@). See on ch. i. 14. 


8. Declared (€&nynoduevos). Better, as Rev., rehearsed. 
See on Luke xxiv. 35. 


9. They (éxetvwv). Those messengers, the servants and the 
soldier. The pronoun has a more specific reference than the 
English they. 


10. Very hungry (zpdo7euvos). Only here in New Testa- 
ment. 


Would have eaten (Jere yevoaoIat). Rev., correctly, de- 
sired to eat. TevécSau is rendered both to eat and to taste, more 
frequently the latter. See Matt. xxvii. 34; John ii. 9; 1 Pet. 
ii. 8; and compare Acts xx. 11. 


He fell into a trance (érésecev é abrév éxotacis). Lit., 
an ecstasy fell upon him. The best texts, however, read éyéveTo, 
came upon him, or happened to him. See on astonishment, 
Mark v. 42. Luke alone employs the word in this sense of 
ecstasy or trance. 


11. Saw (Jewpe?). Rev., better, and more literally, beholdeth. 
See on Lukex.18. The present tense is graphically introduced 
into the narrative. 


Unto him. The best texts omit. 


Sheet (69dvnv). Only here and ch. xi. 5. Originally jine 
linen ; later, sadl-cloth or a sail. Dr. J. Rawson Lumby sug- 
gests that the word, “applied to loose, bellying sails of ships,” 
may indicate that the form of vessel which appeared to Peter 
“recalled an image most familiar to his previous life—the 


Cu. X.] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 499 


wind-stretched canvas of the craft on the Lake of Galilee” 
(“ Expositor,” ili., 272). 


Knit (Sedeuévov). If this is retained, we must render bound, 
or attached ; but the best texts omit, together with the follow- 
ing and. Render, as Rev., let down by four corners. Compare 
ch. xi. 5, 


Corners (apyais). Lit., beginnings ; the extremity or corner, 
marking a beginning of the sheet. ‘“ We are to imagine the 
vessel, looking like a colossal four-cornered linen cloth, letting 
itself down, while the corners attached to heaven to support the 
whole.” The word is used in this sense by Herodotus, describ- 
ing the sacrifices of the Scythians. The victim’s forefeet are 
bound with a cord, “and the person who is about to offer, 
taking his station behind the victim, pulls the end (adpyiv) of 
the rope, and thereby throws the animal down” (iv., 60). The 
suggestion of ropes holding the corners of the sheet (Alford, and, 
cautiously, Farrar) is unwarranted by the usage of the word. It 
was the technical expression in medical language for the ends of 
bandages. The word for sheet in this passage was also the 
technical term for a bandage, as was the kindred word 6960», 
used of the linen bandages in which the Lord’s body was 
swathed. See Luke xxiv. 12; John xix. 40; xx.5,6,7. Mr. 
Hobart says: “We have thus in this passage a technical medi- 
cal phrase—the ends of a bandage—used for the ends of a 
sheet, which hardly any one except a medical man would think 
of employing ” (“ Medical Language of St. Luke”). 


12. All manner of four-footed beasts (7rdvta Ta TeTpdroda). 
Lit., all the four-footed beasts. Without exception, clean and 
unclean. Not, of very many kinds. 


Wild beasts. The best texts omit. 
14. Not so (undayds). Stronger: by no means. “With 


that simple and audacious self-confidence which in his (Peter’s) 
character was so singularly mingled with fits of timidity and

depression, he boldly corrects the voice which orders him, and 
reminds the divine Interlocutor that he must, so to speak, have 
made an oversight ” (Farrar, “ Life and Works of Paul”). Com- 
pare Matt. xvi. 22. 


Common (xowov). Unholy. 


15. Call not thou common (od pz) Koivov). The thought 
goes deeper than merely styling “common.” Lit., do not thou 
defile. Do not profane it by regarding and calling it common. 
Rev., “make not thow common.” 


17. Doubted (6:y7rdpet). See on Luke ix. 7. 


In himself. On reflection, as compared with his ecstatic 
state. 


Had made inquiry (dsepwryjcavtes). “Having inquired 
out ;” having asked their way through (écd) streets and houses, 
until they found the dwelling of the tanner, who was an obscure 
man, and not easily found. 


18. Called. A general summons to any one within, in order 
to make inquiries. 


19. Thought on (dvervSvupoupévov). Was earnestly (Sud) pon- 
dering. 


22. Was warned (éypnuatiodn). See on Matt. ii. 12. 


24. Near (avayxaiovs). The word originally means neces- 
sary ; hence of those who are bound by necessary or natural 
ties ; blood-relations. But as relatives or kinsmen is expressed 
by ovyyeveis, this must be taken in the sense of intimate 
Sriends, a meaning which it has in later Greek writers. 


25. Worshipped (spocexvvycev). An unfortunate transla: 
tion, according to modern English usage, but justified by the 


Cu. XJ THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 501 


usage of earlier English, according to which to worship meant 
simply to honor. Worship is worthship, or honor paid to dig- 
nity or worth. This usage survives in the expressions worship- 
ful and your worship. Inthe marriage-service of the English 
Church occurs the phrase, “With my body I thee worshap.” 
So Wycliffe renders Matt. xix.19, “ Worship thy father and thy 
mother;” and John xii. 26, “If any man serve me, my Father 
shall worship him.” Here the meaning is that Cornelius paid 
reverence by prostrating himself after the usual oriental 
manner. 


28. An unlawful thing (a9éucT0v). The word is peculiar to 
Peter, being used only here and 1 Pet. iv. 3. See note there. 
It emphasizes the violation of established order, being from the 
same root as Ti9npus, to Lay down or establish. The Jews pro- 
fessed to ground this prohibition on the law of Moses ; but there 
is no direct command in the Mosaic law forbidding Jews to as- 
sociate with those of other nations. But Peter’s statement is 
general, referring to the general practice of the Jews to sepa- 
rate themselves in common life from uncircumcised persons. 
Juvenal says that the Jews were taught by Moses “not to 
show the way except to one who practises the same rites, 
and to guide the circumcised alone to the well which they 
seek” (Sat., xiv., 104, 105). Tacitus also says of the Jews that 
“ among themselves they are inflexibly faithful, and ready with 
charitable aid, but hate all others as enemies. They keep 
separate from all strangers in eating, sleeping, and matrimonial 
connections ” (‘‘ Histories,” v., 5). 


Of another nation (4AXoftA@). Only here in New Testa- 
ment. Used of the Philistines, 1 Sam. xiii. 3-5 (Sept.).

* It must be confessed that this statement, as thus amended, is obscure, and 
that the rendering would be greatly simplified by retaining the omitted words, 
as is done by several high authorities, as Meyer, Alford, Hackett, Gloag, De 
Wette, though against strong MS. evidence. They explain the omission in 
these MSS. by the fact that no mention of fasting is made in ver. 3.

41. Chosen before (mpoxeyespotovnpévors). Only here in 
New Testament. The simple verb yerpotovéw, to appoint, oc- 
curs Acts xiv. 23; 2 Cor. viii. 19; and originally means to 
stretch out the hand for the purpose of giving a vote. Hence 
to elect by show of hands, and generally to appoint. Plato uses 
the word of the election of leaders of choruses (‘‘ Laws,” 765). 
In later ecclesiastical usage it signified ordain, as bishops or 
deacons. 


Who (ofrwes). The compound pronoun marks them more 
strongly as belonging to the class of eye-witnesses.

ment of the Spirit before baptism.

through the whole list of incidents. 


6. | considered. See on Matt. vii. 3; Luke xxii. 24, 27. 


12. Nothing doubting (undév dScaxpwopuevov). The Rev. 
renders making no distinction, taking the verb in its original 
sense, which is to separate or distinguish. The rendering seems 
rather strained, doubting being a common rendering in the New 
Testament and giving a perfectly good sense here. See Matt. 
xxi. 21; Mark xi. 23, and note on Jas. i. 6. It was natural that 
Peter should hesitate. 


The six brethren. The men of Joppa who had gone with 
Peter to Cornelius, and had accompanied him also to Jerusalem, 
either as witnesses for him or for their own vindication, since 
they had committed the same offence.

Not so used here. 


20. The Greeks ("EnAnvas). Some, however, read ‘E)X1- 
viotas, the Grecian Jews. See onch. vi.1. The express object 
of the narrative has been to describe the admission of Gentiles 
into the church. There would have been nothing remarkable 
in these men preaching to Hellenists who had long before been 
received into the church, and formed a large part of the church 
at Jerusalem. It is better to follow the rendering of A. V. and 
Rey., though the other reading has the stronger MS. evidence. 
Note, also, the contrast with the statement in ver. 19, to the Jews 
only. There is no contrast between Jews and Hellenists, since 
Hellenists are included in the general term Jews. 


23. Purpose (mpodéce). Originally, placing in public ; set- 
ting before. ence of the shew-bread, the loaves set forth 
before the Lord (see on Mark ii. 26). Something set before one 
as an object of attainment: a purpose. 


24. Good (aya%0s). More than strictly wpreght. Compare 
Rom. v. 7, where it is distinguished from Stxaios, just or 
righteous. “His benevolence effectually prevented him censur- 
ing anything that might be new or strange in these preachers 
to the Gentiles, and caused him to rejoice in their success” 
(Gloag). 


25. To seek (dvatyrjoa). Strictly, like our “hunt up” 
(ava). 


506 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Ca. XI. 


26. Were called Christians (ypnuaticas Xpictiavovs). The 
former of these two words, rendered were called, meant, origi- 
nally, to transact business, to have dealings with ; thence, in the 
course of business, to give audience to, to answer, from which 
comes its use to denote the responses of an oracle ; a divine ad- 
vice or warning. See Acts x. 22; and compare Matt. ii. 12; 
Heb. xi. 7. Later, it acquires the meaning to bear a name ; to 
be called, with the implication of a name used in the ordinary 
transactions and intercourse of men; the name under which 
one passes.* This process of transition appears in the practice 
of naming men according to their occupations, as, in English, 
“John the Smith,” “ Philip the Armorer;” a practice which is 
the origin of many familiar family names, such as Butler, Car- 
penter, Smith, Cooper. Compare in New Testament Alexander 
the coppersmith (2 Tim. iv. 14); Matthew the publican (Matt. 
x. 8); Luke the physician (Col. iv. 14); Erastus the chamber- 
lain (Rom. xvi. 23); Lahab the harlot (Heb. xi. 31). In the 
same line is the use of the word calling, to denote one’s busi- 
ness. The meaning of the word in this passage is illustrated 
by Rom. vii. 3. 

The disciples were called. They did not assume the name 
themselves. It occurs in only three passages in the New Tes- 
tament: here ; ch. xxvi. 28; and 1 Pet. iv. 16; and only in the 
last-named passage is used by a Christian of a Christian. The 
name was evidently not given by the Jews of Antioch, to whom 
Christ was the interpretation of Messiah, and who would not 
have bestowed that name on those whom they despised as 
apostates. The Jews designated the Christians as Wazarenes 
(Acts xxiv. 5), a term of contempt, because it was a proverb 
that nothing good could come out of Nazareth (John i. 47). 
The name was probably not assumed by the disciples them- 
selves; for they were in the habit of styling each other be- 
levers, disciples, saints, brethren, those of the way. It, doubt- 
less, was bestowed by the Gentiles. Some suppose that it was

applied as a term of ridicule, and cite the witty and sarcastic 
character of the people of Antioch, and their notoriety for in- 
venting names of derision; but this is doubtful. The name 
may have been given simply as a distinctive title, naturally 
chosen from the recognized and avowed devotion of the dis- 
ciples to Christ as their leader. The Antiochenes mistook the 
nature of the name, not understanding its use among the dis- 
ciples as an official title—the Anointed—but using it as a per- 
sonal name, which they converted into a party name. 


27. Prophets. See on Luke vii. 26. 
28. The world. See on Luke ii. 1. 


29. According to his ability (ca9@s niopetro tis). Lit., 
according as any one of them was prospered. The verb is from 
evrropos, easy to pass or travel through ; and the idea of pros- 
perity is therefore conveyed under the figure of an easy and 
favorable journey. The same idea appears in our farewell, 
fare meaning originally to travel. Hence, to bid one farewell 
is to wish hima prosperous journey. Compare God-speed. So 
the idea here might be rendered, as each one fared well. 


To send relief (eis Svaxoviay tréupa). Lit., to send for 
ministry.

ure. Seeonch.i. 7. The date is a.p. 44. 


Herod the king. Called also Agrippa, and commonly 
known as Herod Agrippa I., the grandson of Herod the Great. 


Stretched forth his hands (é7éBanev tas xetpas). Lit., aid 
on his hands. The A. V. is wrong, and so is the Rev. Ren- 
der, laid hands on certain of the church to afflict them.

Vex (kaxdoa). Vew is used in the older and stronger sense 
of torment or oppress. See Exod. xxii. 21; Num. xxv. Lite 
Matt. xv. 22. Its modern usage relates rather to petty annoy- 
ances. Rev., better, afflict. 


9. Killed—with the sword. While the martyrdom of 
Stephen is described at length, that of James, the first martyr 
among the apostles, is related in two words. 


3. He proceeded to take (mpocé3eto ovAdafeir). Rev., 
seize. Lit., he added to take. A Hebrew form of expression. 
Compare Luke xix. 11, he added and spake ; Luke xx. 12, 
again he sent a third ; lit., he added to send. 


4. Quaternions. A quaternion was a body of four sol- 
diers; so that there were sixteen guards, four for each of the 
four night-watches. 


The passover. The whole seven days of the feast. 


Bring him forth (avayayeiv airov). Lit., lead him up ; i.e., 
to the elevated place where the tribunal stood, to pronounce 
sentence of death before the people. See John xix. 13. 


5. Without ceasing (éxrevys). Wrong. The word means 
carnest. See on fervently, 1 Pet. i. 22; and compare instantly, 
Acts xxvi. 7; more earnestly, Luke xxii. 44; fervent, 1 Pet. 
iv. 8. The idea of continwance is, however, expressed here by 
the finite verb with the participle. Very literally, prayer was 
arising earnest. 


6. Would have brought. Revy., correctly, was about to 
bring. 


Kept (érjpovv). See on reserved, 1 Pet. i. 4. The imper- 
fect, were keepmng.

was confined. So, rightly, Rev. 


8. Garment ((udriov). The outer garment, or mantle. See 
on Matt. v. 40. 


10. Ward (duvdaxyv). Better, watch: the soldiers on guard. 
Explanations of the jirst and second watch differ, some assum- 
ing that the first was the single soldier on guard at the door of 
Peter’s cell, and the second, another soldier at the gate leading 
into the street. Others, that ¢vo soldiers were at each of these 
posts, the two in Peter’s cell not being included in the four 
who made up the watch. 


12. When he had considered (cuvidév). The verb strictly 
means to see together, or at the same time. Hence, to see in one 
view, to take in at a glance. Peter’s mental condition is de- 
scribed by two expressions: First, he came to himself (ver. 12), 
or, lit., when he had become present in himself ; denoting his 
awaking from the dazed condition produced by his being sud- 
denly roused from sleep and confronted with a supernatural 
appearance (see ver. 9). Secondly, when he had become aware 
(cvvidv) ; denoting his taking m the situation, according to the 
popular phrase. I do not think that any of the commentators 
have sufficiently emphasized the force of ovv, together, as indi- 
cating his comprehensive perception of all the elements of the 
case. They all refer the word to his recognition of his deliver- 
ance from prison, which, however, has already been noted in 
ver. 11. While it may include this, it refers also to all the cir- 
cumstances of the case present at that moment. He had been 
freed ; he was there in the street alone; he must go somewhere ; 
there was the house of Mary, where he was sure to find friends. 
Having taken in all this, percewed it all, he went to the house 
of Mary.* 





* This force of the verb is illustrated by Xenophon (Anabasis, i., 5, 9). 
‘< For one who directed his attention to it (7.é., the numerous evidences of 
‘ power furnished by a great empire) might sce (cumdetv, in a comprehensive 
glance) that the king was powerful.” So Plato (Laws, 904), speaking of God,

13. Door of the gate. The small outside door, forming the 
entrance from the street, and opening into the zrvA@y, or door- 
way, the passage from the street into the court. Others explain 
it as the wécket, a small door in the larger one, which is less 
probable. 


A damsel (zaidtoxnn). Or maid. The word was used of a 
young female slave, as well as of a young girl or maiden gener- 
ally. The narrative implies that she was more than a mere 
menial, if a servant at all. Her prompt recognition of Peter’s 
voice, and her joyful haste, as well as the record of her name, 
indicate that she was one of the disciples gathered for prayer. 


Rhoda. ose. The Jews frequently gave their female chil- 
dren the names of plants and flowers: as Susannah (lily) ; 
Esther (myrtle); Zamar (palm-tree). “God, who leaves in 
oblivion names of mighty conquerors, treasures up that of a 
poor girl, for his church in all ages ” (Quesnel). 


14. She knew. Or recognized. 


15. Constantly affirmed (cvicyupifero). Better, confidently 
affirmed ; constant is used in its older sense of consistent. The 
verb contains two ideas: strong assertion (éexvs), and holding to 
the assertion through all contradiction (6:4) ; hence, she strongly 
and consistently asserted. 


Angel. Guardian angel, according to the popular belief 
among the Jews that every individual has his guardian angel, 
who may, on occasion, assume a visible appearance resembling 
that of the person whose destiny is committed to him. 


17. Beckoning (xataceicas). Lit., having shaken downward 
with his hand, in order to bespeak silence and attention. It was 
a familiar gesture of Paul. See ch. xxi. 40; xxvi. 1.

A technical phrase like the Latin ducere. Compare Matt.

Abode (d:érpiBev). Originally, to rub away, or consume : 
hence, of teme, to spend. 


20. Highly displeased (Svyouaydv). Originally, to fight 
desperately : but as there is norecord of any war of Herod with 
the Tyrians and Sidonians, the word is to be taken in the sense 
of the A. V. Only here in New Testament. 


Chamberlain (rév él tod Kouravos). Lit., the one over the 
bedchamber. 


21. Set (rax7H). Appointed. Only here in New Testament. 
What the festival was, is uncertain. According to some, it was 
in honor of the emperor’s safe return from Britain. Others 
think it was to celebrate the birthday of Claudius; others that 
it was the festival of the Quinquennalia, observed in honor of 
Augustus, and dating from the taking of Alexandria, when the 
month Seatilis received the name of the Emperor—A ugust. 


Arrayed (évéuvcdpevos). More literally, having arrayed him- 


self. 


Royal apparel. Josephus says he was clothed in a robe en-

box in the theatre, set apart for the king, from which he might 
look at the games or address the assembly.

ment. The word is used especially of a popular harangue

(Siuos, the commons). “At Jerusalem Agrippa enacted the 
Jew, with solemn gait and tragic countenance, amidst general 
acclamation; but at Caesarea he allowed the more genial part 
of a Greek to be imposed on him. It was at a festival in this 
Hellenic capital, after an harangue he had addressed to the 
populace, that they shouted, “It is the voice of a god and not of 
aman ” (Merivale, “History of the Romans under the Empire”). 


22. The people (djuos). The assembled people. 


A god. As most of the assembly were heathen, the word 
does not refer to the Supreme Being, but is to be taken in the 
pagan sense—a god. 


93. An angel of the Lord smote him. An interesting par- 
allel is furnished by the story of Alp Arslan, a Turkish prince 
of the eleventh century. “The Turkish prince bequeathed a 
dying admonition to the pride of kings. ‘In my youth,’ said 
Alp Arslan, ‘I was advised by a sage to humble myself before 
God; to distrust my own strength; and never to despise the 
most contemptible foe. I have neglected these lessons, and my 
neglect has been deservedly punished. Yesterday, as from an 
eminence, I beheld the numbers, the discipline, and the spirit 
of my armies; the earth seemed to tremble under my feet, and 
I said in my heart, surely thou art the king of the world, the 
greatest and most invincible of warriors. These armies are no 
longer mine; and, in the confidence of my personal strength, I 
now fall by the hand of an assassin’” (Gibbon, ‘‘ Decline and 
Fall”). 


Eaten of worms (cxwAnKo8pwrtos). Only here in New Tes- 
tament. Of Pheretima, queen of Cyrene, distinguished for 
her cruelties, Herodotus says: ‘Nor did Pheretima herself 
end her days happily. For on her return to Egypt from Libya, 
directly after taking vengeance on the people of Barca, she was 
overtaken by a most horrid death. Her body swarmed with 
worms, which ate her flesh while she was still alive ” (iv., 205). 
The term, as applied to disease in the human body, does not 


Cu. XIIL.) THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 513 


occur in any of the medical writers extant. Theophrastus, 
however, uses it of a disease in plants. The word cxwrn€ is 
used by medical writers of intestinal worms. Compare the ac- 
count of the death of Antiochus Epiphanes, the great perse- 
cutor of the Jews. “So that the worms rose up out of the 
body of this wicked man, and whiles he lived in sorrow and 
pain, his flesh fell away, and the filthiness of his smell was 
noisome to all his army” (2 Mace. ix. 9). Sylla, the Roman 
dictator, is also said to have suffered from a similar disease. 


Gave up the ghost. See on ch. v. 5. 


CHAPTER XIII.

Lucius of Cyrene. Attempts have been made to identify 
him with Luke the evangelist; but the name Lucas is an ab- 
breviation of Zucanus, and not of Lucius. It is worth noting, 
however, that, according to Herodotus (iii., 131), the physicians 
of Cyrene had the reputation of being the second best in 
Greece, those of Crotona being the best; and that Galen the 
physician says that Lucius was before him a distinguished phy- 
sician in Tarsus of Cilicia. From this it has been conjectured 
that Luke was born and instructed in medicine in Cyrene, and 
\eft that place for Tarsus, where he made Paul’s acquaintance, 
and was, perhaps, converted by him (Dr. Howard Crosby, 
“The New Testament, Old and New Version”). But, apart 
from the form of the name (see above), the mention of the 
evangelist’s name here is not in accord with his usual practice, 
since he nowhere mentions his own name, either in the Gospel 
or in the Acts; and if the present passage were an exception, 
we should have expected to find his name last in the list of the 
worthies of Antioch. Of the five here named, four are known 
to be Jews; and therefore, probably, Lucius was also a Jew 
from Cyrene, where Jews are known to have abounded. Luke 
the evangelist, on the contrary, was a Gentile. Nothing cer- 

33 


514 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. _[Cu. XIII. 


tain can be inferred from Rom. xvi. 21, where Lucius is enn- 
merated by Paul among his Ainsmen. If ovyyevets, kinsmen, 
means here, as is claimed by some, countrymen, it would prove 
Lucius to be a Jew; but the word is commonly used of relatives 
in the New Testament. In Rom. ix. 3, Paul applies the term to 
his fellow-countrymen, “my brethren, my kinmsmen according 
to the flesh, who are Lsraelites.” 


Which had been brought up with (civtpogos). Some ren- 
der foster-brother, as Rev. ; others, comrade. ‘The word has both 
meanings. 


2. Ministered (AevToupyovvtwv). See on the kindred noun 
ministration, Luke i. 23. This noun has passed through the 
following meanings: 1. A ezvel service, especially in the tech- 
nical language of Athenian law. 2. A function or office of 
any kind, as of the bodily organs. 3. Sacerdotal ministration, 
both among the Jews and the heathen (see Heb. viii. 6; ix. 
21). 4. The eucharistic services. 5. Set forms of divine wor- 
ship (Lightfoot, “On Philippians,” ii., 17). Here, of the per- 
formance of Christian worship. Our word liturgy is derived 
from it. 


Separate. The Greek adds 67, now, which is not rendered 
by A. V. or Rev. It gives precision and emphasis to the com- 
mand, implying that itis for a special purpose, and to be obeyed 
at the time. Compare Luke ii. 15; Acts xv. 36; 1 Cor. vi. 20. 


4, Sailed. On Luke’s use of words for sadding, see Introduc- 
tion. 


5. Synagogues. The plural implies that the Jews were 
numerous in Salamis. Augustus, according to Josephus, made 
Herod the Great a present of half the revenue of the copper- 
mines of Cyprus, so that numerous Jewish families would be 
settled in the island. In the reign of Trajan, upon the break- 
ing out of a Jewish insurrection, the whole island fell into the 
hands of the Jews, and became a rallying-point for the revolt. 


Cu. XIII.) THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 515 


It is said that two hundred and forty thousand of the native 
population were sacrificed to the fury of the insurgents. When 
the rebellion was extinguished, the Jews were forbidden thence- 
forth, on pain of death, to set foot on the island. 


Minister (irnpérnv). Better, as Rev., attendant. See on 
Matt. v. 25. 


6. Sorcerer (udyov). That the man was an impostor is told 
us in the next word, but not in this term. It is the word used 
of the wise men who came to the Saviour’s cradle. See Matt. 
ii. 1, 7,16. Elymas was a magian ; of what kind is shown by 
Jalse prophet. See on Matt. ii. 1. 


Bar-Jesus. Son of Jesus or Joshua. 


7. The deputy (avSurdr@). Better, Rev., proconsul. See 
Introduction to Luke, on Luke’s accuracy in designating public 
officers. 


Sergius Paulus. Di Cesnola relates the discovery at Soli, 
which, next to Salamis, was the most important city in the 
island, of a slab with a Greek inscription containing the name of 
Paulus, proconsul. 


Prudent (cuver). Better, as Rev., a man of understanding. 
See on Matt. xi. 25. 


8. Elymas. An Arabic word, meaning the wise, and equiv- 
alent to Magus. See on ver. 6. 


Withstood. ‘The position of soothsayer to a Roman pro- 
consul, even though it could only last a year, was too distin- 
guished and too lucrative to abandon without a struggle” (Far- 
rar, “ Life and Work of Paul”). 


9, Saul—Paul. The first occurrence of the name of Paul in 
the Acts. Hereafter he is constantly so called, except when 


516 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.  [Cu. XUIL 


there is a reference to the earlier period of his life. Various 
explanations are given of the change of name. The most sat- 
isfactory seems to be that it was customary for Hellenistic Jews 
to have two names, the one Hebrew and the other Greek or 
Latin. Thus John was also called Marcus ; Symeon, Viger ; 
Barsabas, Justus. As Paul now comes prominently forward as 
the apostle to the Gentiles, Luke now retains his Gentile name, 
as he did his Jewish name during his ministry among the Jews. 
The connection of the name Paul with that of the deputy 
seems to me purely accidental. It was most unlike Paul to 
assume the name of another man, converted by his instrumen- 
tality, out of respect to him or as a memorial of his conversion. 
Farrar justly observes that there would have been in this “an 
element of vulgarity impossible to St. Paul.” 


Set his eyeson him. See on Luke iv. 20. 


10. Mischief (faScoupyias). Only here in New Testament. 
Originally, case or facility in doing ; hence readiness in turning 
the hand to anything, bad or good; and so recklessness, unscru- 
pulousness, wickedness. A kindred word (paduotpynpa, lewdness, 
Rev., vedlany) occurs at ch. xviii. 14. 


Right ways. Or straight, possibly with an allusion to Ely- 
mas’ crooked ways. 


11. Mist (ayAvs). Only here in New Testament. The word 
is used by medical writers as a name for a disease of the eyes. 
The mention of the successive stages, first dimmess, then total 
darkness, are characteristic of the physician. “ The first mira- 
cle which Paul performed was the infliction of a judgment ; 
and that judgment the same which befell himself when arrested 
on his way to Damascus” (Gloag).

Paul and his company (oi wep! tov IIadXov). Lit., those

Mary and Martha. Paul, and not Barnabas, now appears as

tporros, fashion or manner, and dopéw, to bear or suffer. The 
preferable reading, however, is érpopopopyeev ; from Tpopos, & 
nurse; and the figure is explained by, and probably was drawn 
from, Dent. i.31. The American revisers properly insist on 
the rendering, as a nursing-father bare he them. 


19. Divided by lot (xatexAnpovouncev). The A. V. gives 
the literal rendering. The Rev., gave them their land for an 
inheritance, is correct, so far as the meaning inheritance is 
concerned (see on 1 Pet. i. 4), but does not give the sense of 
distribution which is contained in the word. 


94. Before his coming (apo mpocwrov Ths eicddou avTod). 
Lit., before the face of his entrance. A Hebrew form of expres- 
sion.

hence to suspect, conjecture.

the fullest and clearest declaration: declare throughout. 


42. Next (werafd). The word commonly means énterme- 
diate, and hence is explained by some as referring to the in- 
termediate week. But the meaning is fixed by ver. 44; and 
though the word does not occur in the New Testament else- 
where in the sense of neat, it has that meaning sometimes in

5. Assault (op). Too strong, as is also the Rev., onset. 
In case an actual assault had been made, it would have been 
absurd for Luke to tell us that “they were ware of it.” It is 
rather the purpose and intention of assault beginning to as- 
sume the character of a movement. See on Jas. ili. 4. 


To stone. Paul says he was stoned once (2 Cor. xi. 25). 
This took place at Lystra (see ver. 19). 


6. Were ware (cvvidovtes). Rev., became aware. See on

the word in the New Testament is ¢mpossible (see Matt. xix. 26; 
Heb. vi. 4, etc.). The sense of weak or impotent occurs only 
here and Rom. xv. 1.

made straight, Luke xiii. 18, and see note there. 


Leaped (aro). Better, as Rev., leaped up. Note the ao- 
rist tense, indicating a single act, while the imperfect, walked, 
denotes continuous action. 


11. In the speech of Lycaonia. The apostles had been 
conversing with them in Greek. The fact that the people now 
spoke in their native tongue explains why Paul and Barnabas 
did not interfere until they saw the preparations for sacrifice. 
They did not understand what was being said by the people 
about their divine character. It was natural that the surprise 
of the Lystrans should express itself in their own language 
rather than in a foreign tongue. 


In the likeness of men (opuowwSévtes dvIpwrois).  Lit., 
having become like to men. A remnant of the earlier pagan 
belief that the gods visited the earth in human form. Homer, 
for example, is full of such incidents. Thus, when Ulysses 
lands upon his native shore, Pallas meets him 


‘in the shape 
Of a young shepherd delicately formed, 
As are the sons of kings. A mantle lay 
Upon her shoulder in rich folds ; her feet 
Shone in their sandals; in her hands she bore 
A javelin,” 
Odyssey, xiii., 221-225. 


Again, one rebukes a suitor for maltreating Ulysses: 


‘*Madman! what if he 
Came down from heaven and were a god! The gods 
Put on the form of strangers from afar, 
And walk our towns in many different shapes, 
To mark the good and evil deeds of men.” 
Odyssey, xvii., 485 sq. 


12. Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercury. The Greek 
names of these deities were Zeus and Hermes. As the herald 
of the gods, Mercury is the god of skill in the use of speech and 


Cu. XIV.) THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 521 


of eloquence in general, for the heralds are the public speakers 
in the assemblies and on other occasions. Hence he is sent 
on messages where persuasion or argument are required, as to 
Calypso to secure the release of Ulysses from Ogygia (‘‘ Odys- 
sey,” i., 84); and to Priam to warn him of danger and to escort 
him to the Grecian fleet (‘“ Iliad,” xxiv., 390). Horace ad- 
dresses him as the “eloquent ” grandson of Atlas, who artfully 
formed by oratory the savage manners of a primitive race 
(‘“‘ Odes,” i., 10). Hence the tongues of sacrificial animals were 
offered to him. As the god of ready and artful speech, his 
office naturally extended to business negotiations. He was the 
god of prudence and skill in all the relations of social inter- 
course, and the patron of business and gain. A merchant-guild 
at Rome was established under his protection. And as, from 
its nature, commerce is prone to degenerate into fraud, so he 
appears as the god of thievery, exhibiting cunning, fraud, and 
perjury.* ‘“ He represents, so to speak, the utilitarian side of 
thehumanmind. . . . Inthe limitation of his faculties and 
powers, in the low standard of his moral habits, in the abundant 
activity of his appetites, in his indifference, his ease, his good- 
nature, in the full-blown exhibition of what Christian theology 
would call conformity to the world, he is, as strictly as the nat- 
ure of the case admits, a product of the invention of man. He 
is the god of intercourse on earth” (Gladstone, “ Homer and 
the Homeric Age”). 


The chief speaker (6 syovpevos Tod Aoyou). Lit., the lead- 
er in discourse. Barnabas was called Jupiter, possibly because 
his personal appearance was more imposing than Paul’s (see 2 
Cor. x. 1, 10), and also because Jupiter and Mercury were com- 
monly represented as companions in their visits to earth.t

lary deity of Lystra. Itis unnecessary to supply temple, as Rev. 
The god himself was regarded as present in his temple. 


- The gates (7vA@vas). What gates are intended is uncer- 
tain. Some say, the city gates; others, the temple gates ; and 
others, the doors of the house in which Paul and Barnabas were 
residing. See on ch. xii. 13. 


14. Ran in (eicevjdnoav). <A feeble translation, even if this 
reading isretained. The verb means éo leap or spring. The 
best texts read é£emjdncav, sprang forth, probably from the 
gate of their house, or from the city gate, if the sacrifice was 
prepared in front of it. 


Crying out («pdZovres). Inarticulate shouts to attract atten- 
tion. 


15. Of like passions (ouotovraSeis). Only here and Jas. v. 
17, on which see note. Better, of lke nature. 


Turn (émtotpépev). Compare 1 Thess. i. 9, where the same 
verb is used. 


16. Times (yeveats). More correctly, generations, as Rev. 


17. Rains. Jupiter was lord of the air. He dispensed the 
thunder and lightning, the rain and the hail, the rivers and tem- 
pests. ‘‘ All signs and portents whatever, that appear in the air, 
belong primarily to him, as does the genial sign of the rain- 
bow” (Gladstone, “ Homer and the Homeric Age”). The 
mention of rain is appropriate, as there was a scarcity of water 
in Lycaonia. 


Food. Mercury, as the god of merchandise, was also the dis- 
penser of food. 

‘No one can read the speech without once more perceiving 
its subtle and inimitable coincidence with his (Paul’s) thoughts

and expressions. The rhythmic conclusion is not unaccordant 
with the style of his most elevated moods; and besides the ap- 
propriate appeal to God’s natural gifts in a town not in itself 
unhappily situated, but surrounded by a waterless and treeless 
plain, we may naturally suppose that the ‘filling our hearts 
with food and gladness’ was suggested by the garlands and fes- 
tive pomp which accompanied the bulls on which the people 
would afterward have made their common banquet” (Far- 
rar,“ Life and Work of Paul”). For the coincidences between 
this discourse and other utterances of Paul, compare’ ver. 15, 
and 1 Thess.i.9; ver. 16, and Rom. iii. 25; Acts xvii. 30; 
ver. 17, and Rom. i. 19, 20. 


19. Stoned. See on ver. 5. 
20. To Derbe. A journey of only a few hours. 


21. Taught (uaSnredcavtes). More correctly, made discuples 
of, a3 Rev. See on Matt. xiii. 52. 


Many. See on Luke vii. 6. 
22. Confirming. See on stablish,1 Pet. v. 10. 


93. Ordained (xyerpotovncavtes). Only here and 2 Cor. viii. 
19. Rev., more correctly, appointed. The meaning ordain is 
later. See on ch. x. 41. . 


Elders (apeaButépovs). For the general superintendence of 
the church. The word is synonymous with ésioKomot, over- 
seers or bishops (see on visitation, 1 Pet. ii. 12). Those who 
are called elders, in speaking of Jewish communities, are called 
bishops, in speaking of Gentile communities. Hence the latter 
term prevails in Paul’s epistles. 


Commended (rapéJevto). See on set before, Luke ix. 16;

having been sent forth; under escort as a mark of honor. 


Declaring. See on ch. xiii. 41. In the various towns along

on Luke xxiv. 35. 


What miracles, ete. Lit., how many (6ca). 
13. James. See Introduction to Catholic Epistles. 


18. Known unto God, etc. The best texts join these words 
with the preceding verse, from which they omit add ; rendering, 
The Lord, who maketh these things known from the beginning 
of the world. 


19. Trouble (aapevoynetv). Only here in New Testament. 
See on vexed, Luke vi. 18. 


20. Write (érvoretAar). Originally, to send to, as a message ; 
hence, by letter. The kindred noun émuctoAn, whence our 
epistle, means, originally, anything sent by a messenger. Letter 
is a secondary meaning. 


Pollutions (a\voynudtov). A word not found in classical 
Greek, and only here in the New Testament. The kindred verb 
adiayetv, to pollute, occurs in the Septuagint, Dan. i. 8; Mal. 
i. 7, and both times in the sense of defiling by food. Here the 
word is defined by things sacrificed to idols (ver. 29); the flesh 
of idol sacrifices, of which whatever was not eaten by the wor- 
shippers at the feasts in the temples, or given to the priests, 
was sold in the markets and eaten at home. See 1 Cor. x. 25- 
28; and Exod. xxxiv. 15. 


Fornication. In its literal sense. “The association of for- 
nication with three things in themselves indifferent is to be 
explained from the then moral corruption of heathenism, by 
which fornication, regarded from of old with indulgence, and 
even with favor, nay, practised without shame even by philoso-

phers, and surrounded by poets with all the tinsel of lascivious- 
ness, had become in public opinion a thing really indifferent ” 
(Meyer). See Dollinger, “The Gentile and the Jew,” ii., 
237 sq. 


Strangled. The flesh of animals killed in snares, and whose 
blood was not poured forth, was forbidden to the Israelites. 


23. Greeting (yatpew). The usual Greek form of saluta- 
tion. It occurs nowhere else in the salutation of a New Testa- 
ment epistle save in the Epistle of James (i. 1). See note there. 
It appears in the letter of Claudius Lysias (ch. xxiii. 26). 


24, Subverting (dvacxevdfovtes). Only here in New Tes- 
tament, and not found either in the Septuagint or in the 
Apocrypha. Originally, it means to pack up baggage, and so 
to carry away ; hence, to dismantle or disfurnish. So Thu- 
cydides (iv., 116) relates that Brasidas captured Lecythus, and 
then pulled it down and dismantled it (avacxevdoas). From 
this comes the more genera] meaning to lay waste, or ravage. 
The idea here is that of turning the minds of the Gentile con- 
verts upside down; throwing them into confusion like a dis- 
mantled house. 


We gave no commandment (00 cteorevAde9a). The word 
originally means to put asunder ; hence, to distinguish, and so 
of a commandment or injunction, to distinguish and emphasize 
it. Therefore implying express orders, and so always in the 
New Testament, where it is almost uniformly rendered charge. 
The idea here is, then, “we gave no express injunction on the 
points which these Judaizers have raised.” 


25. Barnabas and Paul. Here, as in ver. 12, Barnabas is 
named first, contrary to the practice of Luke since Acts xiii. 9. 
Barnabas was the elder and better known, and in the churel at 
Jerusalem his name would naturally precede Paul’s. The use 
of the Greek salutation, and this order of the names, are two 
undesigned coincidences going to attest the genuineness of this 


Cu. XV.] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 527 


first document preserved to us from the Acts of the primitive 
church. 


29. Blood. Because in the blood was the animal’s life, and 
it was the blood that was consecrated to make atonement. See 
Gen. ix. 6; Lev. xvii. 10-14; Deut. xii. 28, 24. The Gentiles 
had no scruples about eating blood; on the contrary, it was a 
special delicacy. Thus Homer: 


‘* At the fire 
Already lie the paunches of two goats, 
Preparing for our evening meal, and both 
Are filled with fat and blood. Whoever shows 
Himself the better man in this affray, 
And conquers, he shall take the one of these 
He chooses.” 

Odyssey, xviii., 44 sq. 


The heathen were accustomed to drink blood mingled with wine 
at their sacrifices. 


Farewell (és6wo9e). Lit., be strong, like the Latin valete. 
Compare the close of Claudius Lysias’ letter to Festus (ch. xxiii. 
30). 


381. Consolation. See on Acts ix. 31. 


32. Many words. Or, lit., much discourse; adding the 
spoken to the written consolation. 


Exhorted. Or comforted. See on ver. 31. The latter 
agrees better with consolation there. 


Confirmed. See on ch. xiv. 22. 
36. Let us go again and visit (érictpéWavtes 57 émicKxewa- 
peda). Lit., Having returned, let us now visit. The A. V. 


omits now. See on ch. xiii. 2. 


In every city (xara macay modu). Kard has the force of 
city by city. 


528 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XVL 


38. Him (rodrov). Lit., thatone. It marks him very strongly, 
and is an emphatic position at the end of the sentence. 


Departed (arocrdvra). Rev., withdrew. It furnishes the 
derivation of our word apostatize. 


39. The contention was so sharp (éyévero wrapofvopos). 
More correctly, there arose a@ sharp contention. Only here and 
Heb. x. 24. Our word parowysm is a transcription of zrapofuc- 
wos. An angry dispute is indicated. 


Barnabas. The last mention of him inthe Acts.

bas, leading to the inference that the church at Antioch took 
Paul’s side in the dispute.

3. To go forth (é£erJetv). The word is used of going forth 
as a missionary in Luke ix. 6; 3 John 7. 


5. Were established (écrepeotvro). Rather, were strength- 
ened. Another word is used for established. See ch. xiv. 22; 
xv. 32, 41; xviii. 23. There is a difference, moreover, between 
being strengthened and established. See 1 Pet. v. 10.

they came in Macedonia. 


A colony (xodwvia). Roman towns were of two classes: 
municipra, or free towns, and colonies. The distinction, how- 
ever, was not sharply maintained, so that, in some cases, we find 
the same town bearing both names. The two names involved 
no difference of right or of privilege. The historical difference 
between a colony and a free town is, that the free towns were 
taken into the state from without, while the colonies were off- 
shoots from within. “The municipal cities insensibly equalled 
the rank and splendor of the colonies; and in the reign of Ha- 
drian it was disputed which was the preferable condition, of 
those societies which had issued from, or those which had been 
received into, the bosom of Rome” (Gibbon, ‘Decline and 
Fall ”). 

The colony was used for three different purposes in the course 
of Roman history : as a fortified outpost in a conquered country ; 
as a means of providing for the poor of Rome; and as a settle- 
ment for veterans who had served their time. It is with the 
third class, established by Augustus, that we have to do here. 
The Romans divided mankind into cetizens and strangers. An 
inhabitant of Italy was a citizen; an inhabitant of any other 
part of the empire was a peregrinus, or stranger. The colonial 
policy abolished this distinction so far as privileges were con- 
cerned. ‘The idea of a colony was, that it was another Rome 
transferred to the soil of anothercountry. In his establishment 
of colonies, Augustus, in some instances, expelled the existing 
inhabitants and founded entirely new towns with his colonists ; 
in others, he merely added his settlers to the existing population 
of the town then receiving the rank and title of a colony. In 

34 


530 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XVL 


some instances a place received these without receiving any new 
citizens at all. Both classes of citizens were in possession of the 
same privileges, the principal of which were, exemption from 
scourging, freedom from arrest, except in extreme cases, and, 
in all cases, the right of appeal from the magistrate to the em- 
peror. The names of the colonists were still enrolled in one of 
the Roman tribes. The traveller heard the Latin language and 
was amenable to the Roman law. The coinage of the city had 
Latin inscriptions. The affairs of the colony were regulated 
by their own magistrates, named Duumviri, who took pride 
in calling themselves by the Roman title of praetors (see on 
ver. 20), 


13. Out of the city (€&w ris mwodews). The best texts read 
munns, the gate. 


River. Probably the Gangas or Gangites. 


Where prayer was wont to be made (ov évopigero mpo- 
cevx7) evar). The best texts read évopiZowev mpocevynv, where 
we supposed there was a place of prayer. The number of Jews 
in Philippi was small, since it was a military and not a mercan- 
tile city; consequently there was no synagogue, but only a 
proseucha, or praying-place, a slight structure, and often open 
to the sky. It was outside the gate, for the sake of retirement, 
and near a stream, because of the ablutions connected with the 
worship. 


14. Lydia. An adjective: the Lydian; but as Lydia was a 
common name among the Greeks and Romans, it does not fol- 
low that she was named from her native country. 


A seller of purple. On purple, see note on Luke xvi. 19. 


Thyatira. The district of Lydia, and the city of Thyatira 
in particular, were famous for purple dyes. So Homer: 


Cu. XVI] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 531 


* As when some Carian or Maeonian * dame 
Tinges with purple the white ivory, 
To form a trapping for the cheeks of steeds.” 
Itiad, iv., 141. 


An inscription found in the ruins of Thyatira relates to the 
guild of dyers. 


Heard (7jxovev). Imperfect, was hearing while we preached. 


15. Constrained (srape8idcato). Only here and Luke xxiv. 
29, on which see note. The constraint was from ardent grati- 
tude. 


16. Damsel. See on ch. xii. 13. 


Spirit of divination (avedua IvSava). Lit., a spirit, a 
Python. Python, in the Greek mythology, was the serpent 
which guarded Delphi. According to the legend, as related in 
the Homeric hymn, Apollo descended from Olympus in order 
to select a site for his shrine and oracle. Having fixed upon 
a spot on the southern side of Mount Parnassus, he found it 
guarded by a vast and terrific serpent, which he slew with an 
arrow, and suffered its body to rot (wvuJeiv) in the sun. Hence 
the name of the serpent Python (rotting); Pytho, the name of 
the place, and the epithet Pythian, applied to Apollo. The 
name Python was subsequently used to denote a prophetic de- 
mon, and was also used of soothsayers who practised ventrilo- 
quism, or speaking from the belly. The word éyyaorpiuv9os, 
ventriloquist, occurs in the Septuagint, and is rendered having 
a familiar spirit (see Levit. xix. 31; xx. 6, 27; 1 Sam. xxviii. 
7, 8). The heathen inhabitants of Philippi regarded the 
woman as inspired by Apollo; and Luke, in recording this case, 
which came under his own observation, uses the term which 
would naturally suggest itself to a Greek physician, a Python- 
spirit, presenting phenomena identical with the convulsive 
movements and wild cries of the Pythian priestess at Delphi. 





* Caria, the province adjoining Lydia on the south; Maeonia, the ancient 
name of Lydia. 


532 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu XVL 


Soothsaying (wavrevowévn). Akin to paivopas, to rave, in 
allusion to the temporary madness which possessed the priestess 
or sibyl while under the influence of the god. Compare Vir- 
gil’s description of the Cumaean Sibyl : 


“¢ And as the word she spake 
Within the door, all suddenly her visage and her hue 
Were changed, and all her sleekéd hair and gasping breath she drew, 
And with the rage her wild heart swelled, and greater was she grown, 
Nor mortal-voiced ; for breath of god upon her heart was blown 


As he drew nigher.” 
Aeneid, vi., 45 sq. 


18. Grieved (Ssarovn9els). Not strong enough. Rather, 
worn out. Both grieved at the sad condition of the woman, 
and thoroughly annoyed and indignant at the continued demon- 
strations of the evil spirit which possessed her. Compare ch. 
iv.2. 


19. Was gone (é&r9ev). Went owt with the evil spirit. 


20. Magistrates (otparnyois). Their usual name was duwm- 
viri, answering to the consuls of Rome; but they took pride 
in calling themselves otpatnyol, or practors, as being a more 
honorable title. This is the only place in the Acts where Luke 
applies the term to the rulers of a city, See Introduction to 
Luke. 


Jews. Who at this time were in special disgrace, having 
been lately banished from Rome by Claudius (see Acts xviii. 2). 
The Philippians do not appear to have recognized the distinc- 
tion between Christians and Jews. 


21. Being Romans. The Romans granted absolute tolera- 
tion to conquered nations to follow their own religious customs, 
and took the gods of these countries under their protection. 
Otho, Domitian, Commodnus, and Caracalla were zealous parti- 
sans of the worship of Isis; Serapis and Cybele were patronized 
at Rome; and in the reign of Nero the religious dilettanti at 
Rome affected Judaism, and professed to honor the name of 
Moses and the sacred books. Poppaea, Nero’s consort, was 


Cu. XVI] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 533 


their patroness, and Seneca said, “the Jewish faith is now re- 
ceived on every hand. The conquered have given laws to the 
conquerors.” On the other hand, there were laws which for- 
bade the introduction of strange deities among the Romans 
themselves. In 186 z.c., when stringent measures were taken 
by the government for the repression of Bacchanalian orgies in 
Rome, one of the consuls, addressing an assembly of the people, 
said: “ How often in the ages of our fathers was it given in 
charge to the magistrates to prohibit the performance of any 
foreign religious rites; to banish strolling sacrificers and sooth- 
sayers from the forum, the circus, and the city ; to search for 
and burn books of divination; and to abolish every mode of sac- 
rificing that was not conformable to the Roman practice ” (Livy, 
xxxix., 16). It was contrary to strict Roman law for the Jews 
to propagate their opinions among the Romans, though they 
might make proselytes of other nations. 


92. Rent off their clothes (epppyEavtes). Only here in 
New Testament. By the usual formula of command to the lic- 
tors: Go, lictors ; strip off their garments ; let them be scourged | 


To beat (paPditew). From pd860s, a rod. Rev. properly 
adds, with rods. 


93. Prison. See on ch. v. 21. 


94. The inner prison. Some have supposed this to be the 
lower prison, being misled by the remains of the Mamertine 
prison at Rome, on the declivity of the Capitoline, and near the 
Arch of Septimius Severus. This consists of two chambers, one 
above the other, excavated in the solid rock. In the centre of 
the vault of the lower chamber is a circular opening, through 
which it is supposed that prisoners were let down into the dun- 
geon. Modern excavations, however, have shown that these 
two chambers were connected with a series of large chambers, 
now separated by an alley from the prison of St. Peter. The 
opening into the passage leading to these was discovered in the 
lower dungeon. Under this passage ran a drain, which formed 


534 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. _[Cu. XVL 


a branch of the Cloaca Maxima, or main sewer. Six of these 
chambers have been brought to light, evidently apartments of a 
large prison in the time of the Romankings. Mr. John Henry 
Parker, from whose elaborate work on the primitive fortifica- 
tions of Rome these details are drawn, believes that the prison 
of St. Peter now shown to tourists formed the vestibule and 
guard-room of the great prison. It was customary to have 
a vestibule, or house for the warder, at a short distance from 
the main prison. Thus he distinguishes the nner prison from 
this vestibule. With this agrees the description in the Rev. 
John Henry Newman’s “ Callista:” “The state prison was 
arranged on pretty much one and the same plan through the 
Roman empire, nay, we may say throughout the ancient world. 
It was commonly attached to the government buildings, and 
consisted of two parts. The first was the vestebule, or outward 
prison, approached from the praetorium, and surrounded by cells 
opening into it. The prisoners who were confined in these 
cells had the benefit of the air and light which the hall ad- 
mitted. From the vestibule there was a passage into the énte- 
rior prison, called Robur or Lignum, from the beams of wood 
which were the instruments of confinement, or from the char- 
acter of its floor. It had no window or outlet except this door, 
which, when closed, absolutely shut out light and air. This 
apartment was the place into which Paul and Silas were cast at 
Philippi. The utter darkness, the heat, and the stench of this 
miserable place, in which the inmates were confined day and 
night, is often dwelt upon by the martyrs and their biogra- 
phers.” 


Stocks (fdAov). Lit., thetimber. An instrument of torture 
having five holes, four for the wrists and ankles and one for the 
neck. The same word is used for the cross, ch. v. 30% xaos 
Galois 131i Petr 24 


25. Prayed and sang praises (rpocevyopuevor duvovr). Lit., 
praying, they sang hymns. The praying and the praise are not 
described as distinct acts. Their singing of hymns was their 
prayer, probably Psalms. 


Cu. XVI.J THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 535 


27. Would have killed (€wedrev avarpetv). Rev., more cor- 
rectly, was about to kill. Knowing that he must suffer death 
for the escape of his prisoners. 


29. A light (dara). Rev., more correctly, lights. Several 
lamps, in order to search everywhere. 


Sprang in. See on van én, ch. xiv. 14. 


33. He took (waparaBov). Strictly, “took them along with 
(apa) him:” to some other part of the prison. 


Washed their stripes (€\ouvcev amo TOV TANyoV). Properly, 
“ washed them from (a6) their stripes.” The verb Aovew ex- 
presses the bathing of the entire body (Heb. x. 23; Acts ix. 37; 
2 Pet. ii. 22) ; while vérresy commonly means the washing of 
a part of the body (Matt. vi. 17; Mark vii. 3; John xiii. 5). The 
jailer bathed them; cleansing them from the blood with which 
they were besprinkled from the stripes. 


34. Brought (avayayov). Lit., “brought up (dvd).” His 
house would seem to have been above the court of the prison 
where they were. See on took, ver. 33. 


Believing (aemicrevxws). More correctly, having believed ; 
assigning the reason for his joy: “in that he had believed.” 


35. Serjeants (gaPdov7xous). Lit., those who hold the rod. 
The Roman Uictors. They were the attendants of the chief 
Roman magistrates. 


‘¢ Ho, trumpets, sound a war-note ! 
Ho, lictors, clear the way! 
The knights will ride, in all their pride,

They preceded the magistrates one by one in a line. They had

citizens. They also commanded the people to pay proper re- 
spect to a passing magistrate, by uncovering, dismounting from 
horseback, and standing out of the way. The badge of their 
office was the fasces, an axe bound up in a bundle of rods; but 
in the colonies they carried staves. 


Those men. Contemptuons. 


37. They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men 
that are Romans. Hackett remarks that “almost every word 
in this reply contains a distinct allegation. It would be difficult 
to find or frame a sentence superior to it in point of energetic 
brevity.” Cicero in his oration against Verres relates that there 
was a Roman citizen scourged at Messina; and that in the midst 
of the noise of the rods, nothing was heard from him but the 
words, “Iam a Roman citizen.” He says: “It is a dreadful 
deed to bind a Roman citizen; it is a crime to scourge him ; it 
is almost parricide to put him to death.” 


40. They went out. Note that Luke here resumes the third 
person, implying that he did not accompany them. 


CHAPTER XVIT. 


3. Opening and alleging. The latter word is rather pro- 
pounding, or setting forth (mapatiSéwevos). See on set before, 
Luke ix. 16; and commet,1 Pet.iv.19. Bengel remarks, “ Two 
steps, as if one, having broken the rind, were to disclose and ex- 
hibit the kernel.” 


4. Consorted with (mpocexdAnpoeIncav). Only here in New 
Testament. More strictly, “ were added or allotted to.” 


Chief women. The position of women in Macedonia seems 
to have been exceptional. Popular prejudice, and the verdict 
of Grecian wisdom in its best age, asserted her natural inferior- 
ity. The Athenian law provided that everything which a man 


Cu. XVIL) THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 537 


might do by the counsel or request of a woman should be null 
in law. She was little better than a slave. To educate her was 
to advertise her as a harlot. Her companions were principally 
children and slaves. In Macedonia, however, monuments were 
erected to women by public bodies ; and records of male proper 
names are found, in Macedonian inscriptions, formed on the 
mother’s name instead of on the father’s. Macedonian women 
were permitted to hold property, and were treated as mistresses 
of the house. These facts are borne out by the account of 
Paul’s labors in Macedonia. In Thessalonica, Beroea, and Phi- 
lippi we note additions of women of rank to the church; and 
their prominence in church affairs is indicated by Paul’s spe- 
cial appeal to two ladies in the church at Philippi to reconcile 
their differences, which had caused disturbance in the church, 
and by his commending them to his colleagues as women who 
had labored with him in the Lord (Philip. iv. 2, 8). 


5. Of the baser sort (@yopaiwv). From dyopd, the market- 
place ; hence loungers in the market-place; the rabble. Cicero 
calls them swbrostrani, those who hung round the rosira, or 
platform for speakers in the forum ; and Plautus, subbasilicant, 
the loungers round the court-house or exchange. The word 
occurs only here and ch. xix. 38, on which see note, 


Gathered a company (éyAomoujcavtes). Rev., better, a 
crowd. Only here in New Testament. 


6. Rulers of the city (zrodvrdpyas). Another illustration of 
Luke’s accuracy. Note that the magistrates are called by a 
different name from those at Philippi. Thessaionica was nota 
colony, but a free city (see on colony, ch. xvi. 12), and was gov- 
erned by its own rulers, whose titles accordingly did not follow 
those of Roman magistrates. The word occurs only here and 
ver. 8, and has been found in an inscription on an arch at Thes- 
salonica, where the names of the seven politarchs are men- 
tioned. The arch is thought by antiquarians to have been 
standing in Paul’s time. 


5388 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XVIL 


7. Contrary to the decrees of Caesar. The charge at 
Philippi was that of introducing new customs; but as Thessa- 
lonica was not a colony, that charge could have no force there. 
The accusation substituted is that of treason against the em- 
peror; that of which Jesus was accused before Pilate. “The 
law of treason, by which the ancient legislators of the republic 
had sought to protect popular liberty from the encroachments 
of tyranny, . . . was gradually concentrated upon the em- 
peror alone, the sole impersonation of the sovereign people. 
The definition of the crime itself was loose and elastic, such as 
equally became the jealousy of a licentious republic or of a 
despotic usurper” (Merivale, “History of the Romans under 
the Empire”). 


9. Security (ro ixavov). See on Luke vii. 6. Bazi, either 
personal or by a deposit of money. A law term. They en- 
gaged that the public peace should not be violated, and that 
the authors of the disturbance should leave the city. 


11. Searched. Or examined. See on Luke xxiii. 14. 
12. Honorable women. See on ver. 4, and Mark xv. 43. 


15. They that conducted (xaSioravtes). Lit., brought to 
the spot. Note the different word employed, ch. xv. 3 (see note 
there). 


16. Was stirred (aapwévvero). Better, as Rev., was pro- 
voked. See on the kindred word contention (aapofvcpés), ch. 
xv. 39. 


Saw (Sewpotvrr). Better, beheld. See on Luke x. 18. 


Wholly given to idolatry (careiSwrov). Incorrect. The 
word, which occurs only here in the New Testament, and no- 
where in classical Greek, means full of idols. It applies to the 
city, not to the wmhabitants. “We learn from Pliny that at 


Cu. XVIL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 5389 


the time of Nero, Athens contained over three thousand public 
statues, besides a countless number of lesser images within the 
walls of private houses. Of this number the great majority 
were statues of gods, demi-gods, or heroes. In one street there 
stood before every house a square pillar carrying upon it a bust 
of the god Hermes. Another street, named the Street of the 
Tripods, was lined with tripods, dedicated by winners in the 
Greek national games, and carrying each one an inscription to 
a deity. Every gateway and porch carried its protecting god. 
Every street, every square, nay, every purlieu, had its sanctu- 
aries, and a Roman poet bitterly remarked that it was easier in 
Athens to find gods than men” (G. 8S. Davies, “St. Paul in 
Greece”). 


18. Epicureans. Disciples of Epicurus, and atheists. They 
acknowledged God in words, but denied his providence and 
superintendence over the world. According to them, the soul 
was material and annihilated at death. Pleasure was their 
chief good; and whatever higher sense their founder might 
have attached to this doctrine, his followers, in the apostle’s 
day, were given to gross sensualism. 


Stoics. Pantheists. God was the soul of the world, or 
the world was God. Everything was governed by fate, to 
which God himself was subject. They denied the universal 
and perpetual immortality of the soul; some supposing that it 
was swallowed up in deity; others, that it survived only till 
the final conflagration ; others, that immortality was restricted 
to the wise and good. Virtue was its own reward, and vice its 
own punishment. Pleasure was no good, and pain no evil. 
The name Stoic was derived from stoa, a porch. Zeno, the 
founder of the Stoic sect, held his school in the Stoa Pecile, 
or painted portico, so called because adorned with pictures by 
the best masters. 


Babbler (czrepyoroyos). Lit., seed-picker: a bird which 
picks up seeds in the streets and markets ; hence one who picks 


540 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XVIL 


up and retails scraps of news. Trench (“ Authorized Version 
of the New Testament ”) cites a parallel from Shakespeare : 


‘¢ This fellow picks up wit as pigeons peas, 
And utters it again when Jove doth please. 
He is wit’s pedler, and retails his wares 
At wakes, and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs.” 
Love’s Labor’s Lost, v., 2. 


Setter-forth (catayyededs). See on declare, ver. 23. Com- 
pare 1 Pet. iv. 4, 12. 


Strange. Foreign. 


19. Areopagus. The Hill of Mars: the seat of the ancient 
and venerable Athenian court which decided the most solemn 
questions connected with religion. Socrates was arraigned and 
condemned here on the charge of innovating on the state relig- 
ion. It received its name from the legend of the trial of Mars for 
the murder of the son of Neptune. The judges sat in the open 
air upon seats hewn out in the rock, on a platform ascended by 
a flight of stone steps immediately from the market-place. A 
temple of Mars was on the brow of the edifice, and the sanctu- 
ary of the Furies was in a broken cleft of the rock immediately 
below the judges’ seats. The Acropolis rose above it, with the 
Parthenon and the colossal statue of Athene. ‘It was a scene 
with which the dread recollections of centuries were associated. 
Those who withdrew to the Areopagus from the Agora, came, 
as it were, into the presence of a higher power. No place in 
Athens was so suitable for a discourse upon the mysteries of 
religion” (Conybeare and Howson).* 


20. Strange (fevifovra). A participle: surprising. Com- 
pare 1 Pet. iv. 4, 12. 


21. Allthe Athenians. No article. Lit., “ Athenians, all 
of them.” The Athenian people collectively.

St. Paul in Greece ; Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography,

Cu. XVIL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 541 


Strangers which were there (oi émrudnuoovtes Eévor). Rev., 
more correctly, the strangers sojourning there. See on 1 Pet. 
dick: 


Spent their time (evxaipovv). The word means Zo have good 
opportunity; to have leisure : also, to devote one’s leesure to some- 
thing ; to spend the time. Compare Mark vi. 31; 1 Cor. xvi. 12. 


Something new (te cawdrepov). Lit., newer: newer than 
that which was then passing current as new. The comparative 
was regularly used by the Greeks in the question what news ? 
They contrasted what was new with what had been new up to 
the time of asking. The idiom vividly characterizes the state 
of the Athenian mind. Bengel aptly says, ‘“‘ New things at once 
became of no account ; newer things were being sought for.” 
Their own orators and poets lashed them for this peculiarity. 
Aristophanes styles Athens the city of the gapers (“ Knights,” 
1262). Demades said that the crest of Athens ought to be a 
great tongue. Demosthenes asks them, “ Is it all your care to go 
about up and down the market, asking each other, ‘ Is there any 
news?’” In the speech of Cleon to the Athenians, given by 
Thucydides (iii., 38), he says: “No men are better dupes, 
sooner deceived by novel notions, or slower to follow approved 
advice. You despise what is familiar, while you are worship- 
pers of every new extravagance. You are always hankering 
after an ideal state, but you do not give your minds even to 
what is straight before you. In a word, you are at the mercy 
of your own ears.” 


22. | perceive (Jewpa). I regard you, in my careful obser- 
vation of you. See on Luke x. 18. 


Too superstitious (Secvdaiwoveorépovs). This rendering 
and that of the Rev., somewhat superstitious, are both unfortu- 
nate. The word is compounded of de/Sa, to fear, and daipwv, a 
deity. It signifies either a religious or a superstitious sentiment, 
according to the context. Paul would have been unlikely to 
begin his address with a charge which would have awakened. 


542 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. ([Cu. XVIL 


the anger of his audience. What he means to say is, You are 
more divinity-fearing than the rest of the Greeks. This pro- 
pensity to reverence the higher powers is a good thing in itself, 
only, as he shows them, it is misdirected, not rightly conscious 
of its object and aim. Paul proposes to guide the sentiment 
rightly by revealing him whom they ignorantly worship. The 
American revisers insist on very religious. The kindred word 
derotOarpovia occurs ch. xxv. 19, and in the sense of religion, 
though rendered in A. V. superstition. Festus would not call 
the Jewish religion a superstition before Agrippa, who was him- 
self a Jew. There is the testimony of the Ephesian town-clerk, 
that Paul, during his three years’ residence at Ephesus, did not 
rudely and coarsely attack the worship of the Ephesian Diana. 
“Nor yet blasphemers of your goddess” (Acts xix. 37). 


23. Asi passed by (dvepyouevos). More strictly, “ passing 
through (6ua)” your city, or your streets. 


Beheld (dvatewpov). Only here and Heb. xiii. 7. Reyv., 
much better, observed. The compound verb denotes a very at- 
tentive consideration (avd, up and down, throughout). 


Devotions (ceBdopara). Wrong. It means the objects of 
their worship—temples, altars, statues, ete. 


An altar (Gwpov). Only here in New Testament, and the 
only case in which a heathen altar is alluded to. In all other 
cases Jvovactyprov is used, signifying an altar of the true God. 
The Septuagint translators commonly observe this distinction, 
being, in this respect, more particular than the Hebrew script- 
ures themselves, which sometimes interchange the word for the 
heathen altar and that for God’s altar. See, especially, Josh. 
xxii., where the altar reared by the Transjordanic tribes is 
called Bwpos, as being no true altar of God (vv. 10, 11, 16, 19, 
23, a 34); and the legitimate altar, Suoweripiov (vv. 19, 
28, 29). 


To the unknown God (dyveéorm Ocd). The article is want- 
ing. Render, as Rev., oan unknown God. The origin of these 


Cu. XVIL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 543 


altars, of which there were several in Athens, is a matter of 
conjecture. Hackett’s remarks on this point are sensible, and 
are borne out by the following words: ‘‘ whom therefore,” ete. 
“The most rational explanation is unquestionably that of those 
who suppose these altars to have had their origin in the feel- 
ing of uncertainty, inherent, after all, in the minds of the hea- 
then, whether their acknowledgment of the superior powers was 
sufficiently full and comprehensive; in their distinct conscious- 
ness of the limitation and imperfection of their religious views, 
and their consequent desire to avoid the anger of any still un- 
acknowledged god who might be unknown to them. That no 
deity might punish them for neglecting his worship, or remain 
uninvoked in asking for blessings, they not only erected altars 
to all the gods named or known among them, but, distrustful 
still lest they might not comprehend fully the extent of their 
subjection and dependence, they erected them also to any other 
god or power that might exist, although as yet unrevealed to 
them. . . . Under these circumstances an allusion to one of 
these altars by the apostle would be equivalent to his saying to 
the Athenians thus: ‘ You are correct in acknowledging a divine 
existence beyond any which the ordinary rites of your worship 
recognize ; there is such an existence. You are correct in con- 
fessing that this Being is unknown to you; you have no just 
conceptions of his nature and perfections.’ ” 


lgnorantly (ayvoodvres). Rather, wnconsciously: not know- 
ing. There isa kind of play on the words unknown, knowing 
not. Jgnorantly conveys more rebuke than Paul intended. 


Declare I (catayyéAXw). Compare catayyereds, setter-forth, 
in ver. 18. Here, again, there is a play upon the words. Paul 
takes up their noun, setter-forth, and gives it back to them as a 
verb. ‘“ You say I am a setter-forth of strange gods: I now set 
forth unto you (Reyv.) the true God.” 


294. God. With the article: ‘the God.” 


The world (rév xoopov). Originally, order, and hence the 
order of the world ; the ordered universe. So in classical Greek. 


544 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.  [Cu. XVIL 


In the Septuagint, never the world, but the ordered total of the 
heavenly bodies ; the host of heaven (Deut. iv. 19; xvii. 3 ; Isa. 
xxiv. 21; xl. 26). Compare, also, Prov. xvii. 6, and see note 
on Jas. iii. 6. In the apocryphal books, of the universe, and 
mainly in the relation between God and it arising out of the 
creation. Thus, the hing of the world (2 Mace. vii. 9); the 
creator or founder of the world (2 Macc. vii. 23); the great 
potentate of the world (2 Mace. xii. 15). In the New Testa- 
ment: 1. In the classical and physical sense, the universe (John 
xvii. 5; xxi. 25; Rom. i. 20; Eph.i. 4, etc.). 2. As the order 
of things of which man is the centre (Matt. xiii. 38; Mark xvi. 
153" Luke ix! 253" Johnexvi. 21 spn. ti. 125°. Pim svi). 3: 
Humanity as wt manifests itself in and through this order 
(Matty xvii. (92) Pete i> sito; Rom. 10.19). “Then, as 
sin has entered and disturbed the order of things, and made a 
breach between the heavenly and the earthly order, which are 
one in the divine ideal—4. The order of things which is alien- 
ated from God, as manifested in and by the human race: hu- 
manity as alienated from God, and acting in opposition to him 
(John 210s°xi. ol xv. Lo, to. 1 Cor. ). 21>" 1" John mio. 
etc.). The word is used here in the classical sense of the 
visible creation, which would appeal to the Athenians. Stanley, 
speaking of the name by which the Deity is known in the patri- 
archal age, the plural “lohim, notes that Abraham, in per- 
ceiving that all the Hlohim worshipped by the numerous clans 
of his race meant one God, anticipated the declaration of Paul 
in this passage (“ Jewish Church,” i, 25). Paul’s statement 
strikes at the belief of the Epicureans, that the world was 
made by “‘a fortuitous concourse of atoms,” and of the Stoics, 
who denied the creation of the world by God, holding either 
that God animated the world, or that the world itself was 
God. 


Made with hands (xeuporroujrois). Probably pointing to 
the magnificent temples above and around him. Paul’s epistles 
abound in architectural metaphors. He here employs the very 
words of Stephen, in his address to the Sanhedrim, which he 
very probably heard. See ch. vii. 48. 


Cu. XVIL.J THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 545 


25. Is worshipped (Sepazreverar). Incorrect. Render, as 
Rey., served. Luke often uses the word in the sense of to heal 
or cwre ; but this is its primary sense. See on Luke v. 15. It 
refers to the clothing of the images of the gods in splendid 
garments, and bringing them costly gifts and offerings of food 
and drink. 


As though he needed (pocdeduevos). Properly, “needed 
anything ¢n addition (mpos) to what he already has.” 


26. Before appointed (apotetaypévous). The Rev., prop- 
erly, omits before, following the reading of the best texts, mpoo- 
TeTaypévous, assigned. 


Bounds (dpo9ecias). Only here in New Testament. The 
word, in the singular, means the fiwing of boundaries, and so is 
transferred to the fixed boundaries themselves. 


27. Might feel after. See on handle, Luke xxiv. 39. Com- 
pare Tennyson : 


**T stretch lame hands of faith, and grope 
And gather dust and chaff, and call 
To what I feel is Lord of all.” 
In Memoriam, lv. 


28. We are also his offspring. A line from Aratus, a poet 
of Paul’s own province of Cilicia. The same sentiment, in al- 
most the same words, occurs in the fine hymn of Cleanthes to 
Jove. Hence the words, “Some of your own poets.” 


29. The Godhead (70 Jeiov). Lit., that which ts divine. 


Like to gold, etc. These words must have impressed his 
hearers profoundly, as they looked at the multitude of statues 
of divinities which surrounded them. 


Graven (yapdyuart). Not a participle, as A. V., but a noun, 
in apposition with gold, sever, and stone: “a graving or carved- 
work of art,” ete. 

35 


546 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XVIL 


30. Winked at (d7epidav). Only here in New Testament. 
Originally, to overlook ; to suffer to pass unnoticed. So Rev., 
overlooked. 


32. Resurrection. This word was the signal for a derisive 
outburst from the crowd. 


Mocked (éydevafov). From yaAevn, a jest. Only here in 
New Testament, though acompound, dvayAevdt, mock, occurs, 
according to the best texts, at ch. ii. 18. The force of the im- 
perfect, began to mock, should be given here in the translation, 
as marking the outbreak of derision. 

In this remarkable speech of Paul are to be noted: his pru- 
dence and tact in not needlessly offending his hearers; his 
courtesy and spirit of conciliation in recognizing their piety to- 
ward their gods; his wisdom and readiness in the use of the 
inscription “to the unknown God,” and in citing their own 
poets; his meeting the radical errors of every class of his hearers, 
while seeming to dwell only on points of agreement; his lofty 
views of the nature of God and the great principle of the unity 
of the human race; his boldness in proclaiming Jesus and the 
resurrection among those to whom these truths were foolish- 
ness; the wonderful terseness and condensation of the whole, 
and the rapid but powerful and assured movement of the 
thought. 


34. Clave. See on Luke x. 11; xv. 15; Acts v. 13. 


The Areopagite. One of the judges of the court of Are- 
opagus. Of this court Curtius remarks: “ Here, instead of a 
single judge, a college of twelve men of proved integrity con- 
ducted the trial. If the accused had an equal number of votes 
for and against him, he was acquitted. The Court on the hill 
of Ares is one of the most ancient institutions of Athens, and 
none achieved for the city an earlier or more widely spread 
recognition. The Areopagitic penal code was adopted as a 
norm by all subsequent legislators” (‘ History of Greece,” 
i, 307).

CHAPTER XVIII. 


1. Found. “A Jewish guild always keeps together, whether 
in street or synagogue. In Alexandria the different trades sat 
in the synagogue arranged into guilds; and St. Paul could have 
no difficulty in meeting, in the bazaar of his trade, with the 
like-minded Aquila and Priscilla” (Edersheim, “ Jewish Social 
Lites 


2. Lately (spocddtws). Only here in New Testament, 
though the kindred adjective, rendered new, is found in Heb. 
x. 20. It is derived from ¢évw, to slay, and the adjective 
means, originally, /ately slain ; thence, fresh, new, recent. It is 
quite common in medical writings in this sense. 


3. Of the same craft (ouoreyvov). It was a Rabbinical 
principle that whoever does not teach his son a trade is as if 
he brought him up to bea robber. All the Rabbinical authori- 
ties in Christ’s time, and later, were working at some trade. 
Hillel, Paul’s teacher, was a wood-cutter, and his rival, Sham- 
mai, acarpenter. It is recorded of one of the celebrated Rabbis 
that he was in the habit of discoursing to his students from the 
top of a cask of his own making, which he carried every day to 
the academy. 


Tent-makers (cxnvorrowol). Not weavers of the goat’s-hair 
cloth of which tents were made, which could easily be procured 
atevery large town in the Levant, but makers of tents used by 
shepherds and travellers. It was a trade lightly esteemed and 
poorly paid. 


5. Was pressed in the spirit (cuvelyero TO mvevpatt). In- 
stead of spirit the best texts read Ady, by the word. On 
pressed or constrained, see note on taken, Luke iv. 38. The 
meaning is, Paul was engrossed by the word. He was relieved 
of anxiety by the arrival of his friends, and stimulated to 
greater activity in the work of preaching the word. 


548 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XVIII. 


6. Opposed themselves (avtvraccopévov). Implying an 
organized or concerted resistance. See on resisteth, 1 Pet. v. 5. 


12. Gallio. Brother of the philosopher Seneca (Nero’s tu- 
tor), and uncle of the poet Lucan, the author of the “ Phar- 
salia.” Seneca speaks of him as amiable and greatly beloved. 


Deputy. See on ch. xiii. 7. The verb, to be deputy, occurs 
only here. 


Judgmentsseat. See on ch. vii. 5. 


14. Lewdness (fadvodpynua). See on mischief, ch. xiii. 10. 
Rev., vellany. 


15. Question. The best texts read the plural, questions. 
See on ch. xv. 2. 


Judge. In the Greek the position of the word is emphatic, 
at the beginning of the sentence: “Judge of these matters I 
am not minded to be.” 


17. Cared for none of these things. Not said to indicate 
his indifference to religion, but simply that he did not choose 
to interfere in this case. 


18. Took his leave (dotafdpevos). See on Luke ix. 61; 
Mark vi. 46. 


Priscilla and Aquila. They are named in the same order, 
Rom. xvi. 3; 2 Tim. iv. 19. 


Having shorn his head. Referring to Paul, and not to 
Aquila. 


He had avow. A private vow, such as was often assumed 
by the Jews in consequence of some mercy received or of some 
deliverance from danger. Not the Nazarite vow, though simi:

lar in its obligations; for, in the case of that vow, the cutting 
of the hair, which marked the close of the period of obligation, 
could take place only in Jerusalem. 


21. | must by all means keep this feast that cometh in 
Jerusalem. The best texts omit. 


24. Eloquent (Adyios). Only here in New Testament. The 
word is used in Greek literature in several senses. As )oyos 
means either reason or speech, so this derivative may signify 
either one who has thought much, and has much to say, or one 
who can say it well. Hence itis used: 1. Of one skilled n his- 
tory. Herodotus, for example, says that the Heliopolitans are 
the most learned in history (Noytwtarot) of all the Egyptians. 
2. Of an eloquent person. An epithet of Hermes or Mercury, 
as the god of speech and eloquence. 3. Of a learned person 
generally. There seems hardly sufficient reason for changing 
the rendering of the A. V. (Rev., learned), especially as the 
scripture-learning of Apollos is specified in the words mighty 
in the scriptures, and his superior eloquence appears to have 
been the reason why some of the Corinthians preferred him to 
Paul. See 1 Cor. i. 12; ii. 4; 2 Cor. x. 10. 


25. Instructed. See on Luke i. 4. 


Fervent (fwv). Fervent, which is formed from the parti- 
ciple of the Latin ferveo, to boil or ferment, is an exact transla- 
tion of this word, which means ¢o seethe or bubble, and is there- 
fore used figuratively of mental states and emotions. See on 
leaven, Matt. xiii. 33. 


Diligently (axpsBas). Rather, accurately ; so far as his 
knowledge went. The limitation is given by the words fol- 
lowing: knowing only the baptism of John. See on Luke i. 3; 
and compare the kindred verb, inquired diligently, Matt. ii. 7, 
where Rey. renders learned carefully. 


96. More perfectly (dxpiBéorepov). The comparative of the 
same word. More accurately. 


550 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.  [Cu. XIX. 


27. Exhorting (apotpedpevor). Originally, to turn for- 
ward, as in flight. Hence, to wmpel or urge. The word may 
apply either to the disciples at Corinth, in which case we must 
render as A. V., or to Apollos himself, as Rev., encowraged 
him. I prefer the former. Hackett very sensibly remarks that 
Apollos did not need encouragement, as he was disposed to go. 


Helped (cuveBarero). The radical sense of the word is to 
throw together: hence, to contribute; to help ; to be useful to. 
He threw himself into the work along with them. On different 
senses of the word, see notes on Luke ii. 19; xiv. 81; and com- 
pare Actsiv. 153 xvii. 18; xvni? 27 xx. 14. 


Through grace. Grace has the article, the special grace of 
God imparted. Expositors differ as to the connection ; some 
joining through grace with them which had believed, insisting on 
the Greek order of the words; and others with helped, refer- 
ring to grace conferred on Apollos. I prefer the latter, princi- 
pally for the reason urged by Meyer, that ‘“‘the design of the 
text is to characterize Apollos and his work, and not those who 
believed.” 


28. Mightily (edtévws). See on Luke xxiii. 10. 


Convinced (dsaxatnréyyero). Only here in New Testament. 
See on tell hom his fault, Matt. xviii. 15. The compound here 
is a very strong expression for thorough confutation. Confute 
(Rev.) is better than convince. Note the prepositions. He con- 
futed them thoroughly (Si), against (card) all their arguments, 


CHAPTER XTX. 


1. Upper coasts (7a avwrepixa uépn). Coasts is a bad ren- 
dering. Better, as Rev., “the upper cowntry;” lit., parts or 
districts. The reference is to districts like Galatia and Phrygia, 
lying wp from the sea-coast and farther inland than Ephesus. 
Hence the expedition of Cyrus from the sea-coast toward Central 
Asia was called Anabasis, a going-up. 


Gu XEX)) THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 551 


Certain disciples. Disciples of John the Baptist, who, like 
Apollos, had been instructed and baptized by the followers of 
the Baptist, and had joined the fellowship of the Christians. 
Some have thought that they had been instructed by Apollos 
himself; but there is no sufficient evidence of this. “There 
they were, a small and distinct community about twelve in 
number, still preparing, after the manner of the Baptist, for 
the coming of the Lord. Something there was which drew 
the attention of the apostle immediately on his arrival. They 
lacked, apparently, some of the tokens of the higher life that 
pervaded the nascent church ; they were devout, rigorous, aus- 
tere, but were wanting in the joy, the radiancy, the enthusiasm 
which were conspicuous in others” (Plumptre, “St. Paul in 
Asia Minor”). 


9. Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed ? 
The two verbs are in the aorist tense, and therefore denote in- 
stantaneous acts. The A. V. therefore gives an entirely wrong 
idea, as there is no question about what happened after believ- 
ing; but the question relates to what occurred when they be- 
lieved, Hence Rev., rightly, Did ye receive the Holy Ghost 
when ye believed ? 


We have not heard. Also the aorist. We did not hear ; 
referring back to the time of their beginning. 


Whether there be any Holy Ghost. But, as Bengel ob- 
serves, “They could not have followed either Moses or John 
the Baptist without having heard of the Holy Ghost.” The 
words, therefore, are to be explained, not of their being un- 
aware of the existence of the Holy Ghost, but of his presence 
and baptism on earth. The word éorw, there be, is to be taken 
in the sense of be present, or be given, as in John vii. 39, where 
it is said, “ The Holy Ghost was not yet (obra jv),” and where 
the translators rightly render, “ was not yet gwen.” 


3. Unto what (eis 7/). Rev., more correctly, into. See on 
Matt. xxviii. 19. 


552 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Ca. XIX

Testament. ‘Here, at last, he wholly gives place to Christ ”

11. Special (od ras tvyotcas). A peculiar expression. Lit., 
not usual or common, such as one might fall im with frequently. 


12. Body (xypwtds). Properly, the surface of the body, the 
skin ; but, in medical language, of the body. 


Handkerchiefs (covdapia). See on Luke xix. 20. 


Aprons (cyuxivdva). Only herein New Testament. A Latin 
word, semicmetia. Lit., something passing half-way round the 
body: an apron or waistband. Perhaps garments worn by 
Paul when engaged at his trade. 


13. Vagabond (reptepyopévwr). Lit., going about. Rev., 
strolling. 


Exorcists (€Eopxtot@v). Only here in New Testament. The 
kindred verb, adjure, occurs Matt. xxvi. 63, and means, origi- 
nally, to admenister an oath. These Jewish exorcists pretended 
to the power of casting out evil spirits by magical arts derived 
from Solomon. 


14. Did (zovodvres). The participle denotes a practice. 


15. I know—-l know (ywecxo—érictayat). There isa pur- 
pose in using two different words to denote the demon’s recog- 
nition of the Divine Master and of the human agent, though 
it is not easy to convey the difference in a translation. It is 
the difference between an instinctive perception or recognition 
of a supreme power and the more intimate knowledge of a hu- 
man agent. A divine mystery would invest Jesus, which the 
demon would feel, though he could not penetrate it. His

knowledge of a man would be greater, in his own estimation at 
least. The difference may be given roughly, thus: “Jesus I 
recognize, and Paul J am acquainted with.” 


Overcame them (xaraxupievcas). The best texts read both 
of them, which would imply that only two of the seven were 
concerned in the exorcism. Rev., better, mastered, thus giving 
the force of «épios, master, in the composition of the verb. 


16. Prevailed against (icyvce). See on Luke xiv. 30; 
xvi. 3. 


17. Was known (éyévero yvworov). More correctly, became 
known. 


18. Confessed and shewed (é£ouoroyovpevos Kal avaryyér- 
Novtes). The two words denote the fullest and most open con- 
fession. They openly (é&) confessed, and declared thoroughly 
(avd, from top to bottom) their deeds. See on Matt. iii. 6. 


19. Curious arts (ra eplepya). The word means, literally, 
overwrought, elaborate, and hence recondite or curious, as mag- 
ical practices. Only here and 1 Tim. v. 18, in its original sense 
of those who busy themselves eacessively (aept): busybodees. 
The article indicates the practices referred to in the context. 


Books. Containing magical formulas. Heathen writers often 
allude to the Hphesian letters. These were symbols, or magical 
sentences written on slips of parchment, and carried about as 
amulets. Sometimes they were engraved on seals. 


Burned (catéxawov). Burned them up (card). The imperfect 
is graphic, describing them as throwing book after book on the 


pile. 


Counted (cuvetrjpicav). Only herein New Testament. See 
on Luke xiv. 28. The preposition ovv, together, in the com- 
pound verb, indicates the reckoning up of the sum-total. 


554 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XIX, 


Fifty thousand pieces of silver. If reckoned in Jewish 
money, about thirty-five thousand dollars; if in Greek drachme, 
as is more probable, about nine thousand three hundred dollars. 


23. The way. See on ch. ix. 2. 
24. Silversmith (apyupoxorros). Lit., a selver-beater. 


Shrines. Small models of the temple of Diana, containing 
an image of the goddess. They were purchased by pilgrims to 
the temple, just as rosaries and images of the Virgin are bought 
by pilgrims to Lourdes, or bronze models of Trajan’s column 
or of the Colonne Vendéme by tourists to Rome or Paris.* 


Craftsmen (reyvirais). In the next verse he mentions the 
workmen (épydras), the two words denoting, respectively, the 
artisans, who performed the more delicate work, and the da- 
borers, who did the rougher work. 


25. Wealth (evzropia). See on ability, ch. xi. 29.  Lit., wel- 
Jare. Wealth is used by the A. V. in the older and more gen- 
eral sense of weal, or well-being generally. Compare the Litany 
of the English Church: “In all time of our tribulation, in all 
time of our wealth.” 


27. Craft (uépos). Lit., part or department of trade. 


To be set at nought (eis dmedeypov erSeiv). Lit., to come 
into refutation or exposure; hence, disrepute, as Rev. Com- 
pare ch. xviii. 28, and see note there. *Azeneypos, refutation, 
occurs only here in New Testament. 


Diana. Or Artemis. We must distinguish between the 
Greek Artemis, known to the Romans as Diana, and the Ephe- 
sian goddess. The former, according to the legend, was the 
daughter of Zeus (Jove), and the sister of Apollo. She was

Cu. XIX.) THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 555 


the patroness of the chase, the huntress among the immortals, 
represented with bow, quiver, and spear, clad in hunting-habit, 
and attended by dogs and stags. She was both a destroyer 
and a preserver, sending forth her arrows of death, especially 
against women, but also acting as a healer, and as the special 
protectress of women in childbirth. She was also the goddess 
of the moon. She was a maiden divinity, whose ministers were 
vowed to chastity. 

The Ephesian Artemis is totally distinct from the Greek, 
partaking of the Asiatic character, and of the attributes of the 
Lydian Cybele, the great mother of the gods. Her worship 
near Ephesus appears to have existed among the native Asiatic 
population before the foundation of the city, and to have been 
adopted by the Greek immigrants, who gradually transferred 
to her features peculiar to the Grecian goddess. She was the 
personification of the fructifying and nourishing powers of 
nature, and her image, as represented on current coins of the 
time, is that of a swathed figure, covered with breasts, and 
holding in one hand a trident, and in the other a club. This 
uncouth figure, clad in a robe covered with mystic devices, 
stood in the shrine of the great temple, hidden by a purple 
curtain, and was believed to have fallen down from heaven 
(ver. 35). In her worship the oriental influence was predomi- 
nant. The priests were eunuchs, and with them was associated 
a body of virgin priestesses and a number of slaves, the lowest 
of whom were known as neocori, or temple-sweepers (ver. 35). 
“ Many a time must Paul have heard from the Jewish quarter 
the piercing shrillness of their flutes, and the harsh jangling of 
their timbrels; many a time have caught glimpses of their de- 
testable dances and Corybantic processions, as, with streaming 
hair, and wild cries, and shaken torches of pine, they strove to 
madden the multitudes into sympathy with that orgiastic wor- 
ship which was but too closely connected with the vilest de- 
baucheries ” (Farrar, “ Life and Work of Paul”). 


Magnificence. See on 2 Pet. i. 16.

continued crying. This reiteration was a characteristic of the 
oriental orgiastic rites. 


29. The theatre. The site of which can still be traced. It 
is said to have been capable of seating fifty-six thousand persons. 


Having seized (cvvaprdcartes). Lit., “ having seized along 
with (vv) :” carried them along with the rush. 


Companions in travel (cvvexdnuous). Only here and 2 Cor. 
viii. 19. The word is compounded of ody, along with, éx, forth, 
and dSfmos, country or dand, and means, therefore, one who has 
gone forth with another from his country. 


31. Of the chief officers of Asia (trav “Acvapyav). The 
Asiarchs. These were persons chosen from the province of 
Asia, on account of their influence and wealth, to preside at the 
public games and to defray their expenses. 


33. They drew (apoe8iBacav). More correctly, wrged for- 
ward. See on before instructed, Matt. xiv. 8. 


34. With one voice cried out. Thereverberations of their 
voices from the steep rock which formed one side of the 
theatre must have rendered their frenzied cries still more ter- 
rifie. 


35. The towneclerk. Or recorder, who had charge of the 
city-archives, and whose duty it was to draw up official decrees 
and present them to assemblies of the people. Next to the 
commander, he was the most important personage in the Greek 
free cities. 


Worshipper (vewxdpor). Lit., a temple-sweeper. See on ver. 
27. This title, originally applied to the lowest menials of the 
temple, became a title of honor, and was eagerly appropriated 
by the most famous cities. Alexander says, “The city of Eph- 
esus is the sacristan of the great goddess Artemis.”*

36. Quiet (kateotaduévous). Compare gudeted (ver. 85). 
The verb means to let down or lower ; and so is applied, meta- 
phorically, to keeping one’s self in check ; repressing. 


Rash (porerés). Lit., headlong. 


37. Robbers of churches (iepocvdous). The A. V. puts a 
droll anachronism into the mouth of the town-clerk of a Greek 
city. Render, rather, as Rev., robbers of temples. 


38. The law is open (ayopaio. ayovrai). Lit., the court-days 
are being kept. Rev., the courts are open. Compare ch. xvii. 5. 


Deputies (av9vraro). Proconsuls, by whom Asia, as a sen- 
atorial province, was governed. See Introduction to Luke. 


40. Concourse (cvorpodijs). Lit., a twisting together : hence 
of anything which is rolled or twisted into a mass ; and so of a 
mass of people, with an underlying idea of confusion : a mob. 
Compare ch. xxiii. 12. 


CHAPTER XX. 


1. Embraced (domacdpevos). Better, as Rev., took leave. 
The word is used for a salutation either at meeting or parting. 
See ch. xxi. 6, 7. 


9. Greece. The Roman province of Achaia, comprehend- 
ing Greece proper and the Peloponnesus. Luke uses Achaca 
(ch. xix. 21) and Greece synonymously, as distinguished from 
Macedonia. 


3. Sail (avdyeo9ar). Better, as Rev., seé sail. See on Luke 
viii. 22; and compare Luke v. 3.

6. In five days (dypis epev trévte). Lit., “ up to five days,” 
indicating the duration of the voyage from Philippi. 


7. First (7H psd). Lit., “the one day.” The cardinal nu- 
meral here used for the ordinal. 


Week (ca8Sdrwv). The plural used for the singular, in imi- 
tation of the Hebrew form. The noun Sabbath is often used 
after numerals in the signification of a week. See Matt. xxviii. 
1; Mark xvi. 2; John xx. 19. 


To break bread. The celebration of the eucharist, coupled 
with the Agape, or love-feast. 


Preached (d:vehéyero). Better, as Rev., discoursed with them. 
It was a mingling of preaching and conference. Our word dia- 
logue is derived from the verb. 


8. Many lights. A detail showing the vivid impression of 
the scene upon an eye-witness. It has been remarked that the 
abundance of lights shows how little of secrecy or disorder at- 
tached to these meetings. 


The upper chamber. | See on ch. i. 13. 


9. The window. See on ch. ix. 25. The windows of an 
Eastern house are closed with lattice-work, and usually reach 
down to the floor, resembling a door rather than a window. 
They open, for the most part, to the court, and not to the street, 
and are usually kept open on account of the heat. 


Cu. XX.] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 559 


Fallen into a deep sleep (catadepopevos drrvm Bade?). Lit., 
borne down by, ete. A common Greek phrase for being over- 
come by sleep. In medical language the verb was more fre- 
quently used in this sense, absolutely, than with the addition of 
sleep. In this verse the word is used twice: in the first instance, 
in the present participle, denoting the coming on of drowsiness 
—falling asleep; and the second time, in the aorist participle, 
denoting his being completely overpowered by sleep. Mr. Hobart 
thinks that the mention of the causes of Eutychus’ drowsiness— 
the heat and smell arising from the numerous lamps, the length 
of the discourse, and the lateness of the hour—are characteristic 
of a physician’s narrative. Compare Luke xxii, 45. 


Dead (vexpds). Actually dead. Not as dead, or for dead. 


10. Fell on him. Compare 1 Kings xvii. 21; 2 Kings 
iv. 34. 


Trouble not yourselves (7) JopuBeicde). Rev., more cor- 
rectly, make ye no ado. They were beginning to utter passion- 
ate outeries. See Matt. ix. 23; Mark v. 39. 


His life is in him. In the same sense in which Christ said, 
“The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth ” (Luke viii. 52). 


11. Having gone up. From the court to the chamber 
above. 


Talked (ousryjoas). Rather, communed. It denotes a more 
familiar and confidential intercourse than déscoursed, in ver. 7. 


13. To go afoot (efevew). Only here in New Testament. 
There is no good reason for changing this to by land, as Rev. 
The A. V. preserves the etymology of the Greek verb. The 
distance was twenty miles; less than half the distance by sea. 


15. Arrived (aapeBddopuev). Only here and Mark iv. 30, 
where it is used more nearly according to its original sense, to 


560 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XX. 


throw beside; to bring one thing beside another in comparison. 
Here, of bringing the vessel alongside the island. The narra- 
tive implies that they only towched (Rev.) there, but not neces- 
sarily the word. 


16. To spend time (ypovorpsBjca). Only here in New 
Testament. The word carries the suggestion of a waste of 
time, being compounded with tp/Ba, to rub; to wear out by 
rubbing. The sense is nearly equivalent to our expression, 
fritter away time. 


17. Having sent to Ephesus. About thirty miles. 
Elders. Called overseers or bishops in ver. 28. 


20. Kept back (i7eoreiWaunv). A picturesque word. Orig- 
inally, to draw im or contract. Used of furling sails, and of 
closing the fingers; of drawing back for shelter; of keeping 
back one’s real thoughts; by physicians, of withholding food 
from patients. It is rather straining a point to say, as Canon 
Farrar, that Paul is using a nautical metaphor suggested by his 
constantly hearing the word for furling sail used during his 
voyage. Paul’s metaphors lie mainly on the lines of military 
life, architecture, agriculture, and the Grecian games. The 
statement of Canon Farrar, that he “ constantly draws his meta- 
phors from the sights and circumstances immediately around 
him,” is rather at variance with his remark that, with one ex- 
ception, he “ cannot find a single word which shows that Paul 
had even the smallest susceptibility for the works of nature ” 
(“ Paul,” i., 19). Nautical metaphors are, to say the least, not 
common in Paul’s writings. I believe there are but three in- 
stances: Eph. iv. 14; 1 Tim. i. 19; vi. 9. Paul means here 
that he suppressed nothing of the truth through fear of giving 
offence. Compare Gal. ii. 12; Heb. x. 38. 


21. Repentance toward God. Repentance has the article: 
the repentance which is due to God. So, also, Faith: the faith 
which is due toward Christ, as the advocate and mediator. 


Cai xXX] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 561 


22. Bound in the spirit. In Ads own spirit. Constrained 
by an invincible sense of duty. Not by the Holy Spirit, which 
is mentioned in the next verse and distinguished by the epithet 
the Holy. 


23. Testifieth (Scauaptiperas). The compound verb signi- 
fies full, clear testimony. Not by internal intimations of the 
Spirit, but by prophetic declarations “in every city.” Two of 
these are mentioned subsequently, at Tyre and Caesarea (ch. 
xxi td 


24. But none of these things move me, neither count I, 
etc. The best texts omit nezther count J, and render, L esteem 
my life of no account, as if it were precious to myself. 


Dear (tywiav). Of value; precious. 


Course (Spéuov). A favorite metaphor of Paul, from the 
race-course. See 1 Cor. ix. 24-27; Philip. iii. 14; 2 Tim. iv. 7. 


95. | know. The J is emphatic: Z know through these 
special revelations to myself (ver. 23). 


26. This day (7H o7rpepov jyépa). Very forcible. Lit., on 
to-day’s day ; this, our parting day. 


27. Shunned. The same word as in ver. 20: kept back. 


28. To yourselves and to all the flock. To yourselves 
first, that you may duly care for the flock. Compare 1 Tim. 
iv. 16. 


Overseers (émsoxérovs). Denoting the official function of 
the elders, but not in the later ecclesiastical sense of beshops, as 
implying an order distinct from presbyters or elders. The two 
terms are synonymous. The elders, by virtue of their office, 
were overseers.*

To feed (rowwaivev). See on Matt. ii. 6. The word embraces 
more than feeding ; signifying all that is included in the office 
of a shepherd : tending, or shepherding. 


Purchased (srepterrounoato). Only here and 1 Tim. ii. 13. 
See on peculiar people, 1 Pet. ii. 9. The verb means, originally, 
to make (qrovéw) to remain over and above (rept): hence to keep 
or save for one’s self ; to compass or acquire.

To warn (vouvIeTav). From vods, the mind, and ri9nps, to 
put. Lit., to put in mind; admonish (so Rev., better than 
warn). ‘It’s fundamental idea is the well-intentioned serious- 
ness with which one would influence the mind and disposition 
of another by advice, admonition, warning, putting right, ac- 
cording to circumstances ” (Cremer).

Build you up. A metaphor in constant use by Paul, and 
preserved in the words edify, edification (Latin, aedes, “a house,” 
and facere, “to make”) by which oixodouém and its kindred 
words are frequently rendered. In old English the word edify 
was used in its original sense of dbwild. Thus Wycliffe renders 
Gen. ii. 22, “The Lord God edzfied the rib which he took of 
Adam, into a woman.” 

So, too, Spenser : 


‘*a little wide 
There was a holy temple edified.”’

traded in costly garments, or kept them stored up for future use. 
See on purple, Luke xvi. 19; and compare Ezra ii. 69; Neh. 
vii. 70; Job xxvii. 16. This fact accounts for the allusions to 
the destructive power of the moth (Matt. vi. 19; Jas. v. 2). 


Cu. XXI.J THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 563 


35. | have shewed you all things (advta trédeEa vpiv). 
The verb means to shew by example. Thus, Luke vi. 47, “I 
will shew you to whom he is like,” is followed by the illustra- 
tion of the man who built upon the rock. So Acts ix.16. God 
will shew Paul by practical experience how great things he must 
suffer. The kindred noun tiddevypa is always rendered example 
or pattern. See John xiii. 15; Jas. v. 10, etc.; and note on 2 
Pet. ii. 6. Rey., correctly, Jn all things I gave you an example. 


So. As Ihave done. 
To help (avtiAauBdavecdas). See on Luke i. 54. 


He said (avrds eizre). Rev., more strictly, “ he homself said.” 
This saying of Jesus is not recorded by the Evangelists, and was 
received by Paul from oral tradition. 

The speech of Paul to the Ephesian elders “ bears impressed 
on it the mark of Paul’s mind: its ideas, its idioms, and even 
its very words are Pauline; so much so as to lead Alford to ob- 
serve that we have probably the literal report of the words 
spoken by Paul. ‘It is, he remarks, ‘a treasure-house of 
words, idioms, and sentences peculiar to the apostle himself’ ”

37. Kissed (xatep{Aovv). See on Matt. xxvi. 49. 


38. See (Sewpeiv). See on Luke x.18. The word for stead- 
fast, earnest contemplation suggests the interest and affection 
with which they looked upon his countenance for the last time.

in the word an expression of the grief and reluctance with which 
they parted, and render having torn ourselves away. See on

3. Discovered (avaddvavres). Better, sighted. A nautical 
phrase. The verb literally means to bring to light : and its use 
here is analogous to the English marine phrase, to raise the land. 


4. Finding disciples (dvevpdvres tods wadntas). The verb 
means to discover after search ; and the article, the disciples, 
refers to the disciples who lived and were recognized members 
of the church there. The A. V. overlooks both the preposition 
and the article. The verb might be rendered strictly by our 
common phrase, “ having looked up the disciples.” See on Luke

11. Bound his own feet and hands. Imitating the sym- 
bolical acts of the Old Testament prophets. See 1 Kings xxii. 
11; Isa. xx. 1-3; Jer. xiii, 1-7; Ezek. iv. 1-6. Compare John 
xxi. 18: 


12. Besought him not to go up. This suggests the case 
of Luther when on his journey to the Diet of Worms, and the 
story of Regulus the Roman, who, being permitted to return to 
Rome with an embassy from the Carthaginians, urged his coun- 
trymen to reject the terms of peace, and to continue the war, 
and then, against the remonstrances of his friends, insisted on 
fulfilling his promise to the Carthaginians to return in the event 
of the failure of negotiations, and went back to certain torture 
and death. 


13. lam ready (éroluas éyw). Lit., 7 hold myself in readi- 
NESS. 


15. Took up our carriages (arocxevacduevor). The verb 
means to pack up and carry off, oY simply to pack or store 
away. Hence, some explain that Paul packed and stored the 
greater part of his luggage in Caesarea. The best texts, how- 
ever, read émucKxevacdpevol, having equipped ourselves. Car- 
riages is used in the old English sense, now obsolete, of that 
which is carried, baggage. See 1 Sam. xvii. 22, dau Ne 


16. Bringing with them, etc. This would imply that 
Mnason was at Caesarea, and accompanied Paul and his com- 
panions to Jerusalem. It seems better to suppose that the dis- 
ciples accompanied the apostle in order to introduce him to 
Mnason, whom they knew. Render, conducting us to Mnason, 
with whom we should lodge. 


Old (dpyaip). Better, as Rev., carly. The rendering old 
might be taken to mean aged ; whereas the word means of 


long standing. 


21. They are informed (carnyndncav). More than in-

Jormed. They had been carefully instructed, probably by the 
Judaizing teachers. See on instructed, Luke i. 4. 


To forsake Moses (amoctaciay ard Macéos). Lit., apos- 
tasy from Moses. Compare 2 Thess. ii. 3. 


22. What is it therefore? How does the matter lie? 
What is to be done ? 


The multitude must needs come together. Some texts 
omit. So Rev. If retained, we should read a multitude. 


23. A vow. The Nazarite vow. See Num. vi. 1-21. 


24, Be at charges with them (Samrdvycov ér avtois). Lit., 
spend upon them. Pay the necessary charges on their account. 
Hence Rev., rightly, “(for them.” The person who thus paid 
the expenses of poor devotees who could not afford the neces- 
sary charges shared the vow so far that he was required to stay 
with the Nazarites until the time of the vow had expired. 
“For a week, then, St. Paul, if he accepted the advice of James 
and the presbyters, would have to live with four paupers in 
the chamber of the temple which was set apart for this pur- 
pose; and then to pay for sixteen sacrificial animals and the 
accompanying meat-offerings” (Farrar, “Life and Work of 
Paul”). He must also stand among the Nazarites during the 
offering of the sacrifices, and look on while their heads were 
shaved, and while they took their hair to burn it under the 
caldron of the peace-offerings, “and while the priest took four 
sodden shoulders of rams, and four unleavened cakes out of the 
four baskets, and four unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and 
put them on the hands of the Nazarites, and waved them for a 
wave-offering before the Lord” (Farrar).

Declaring (SuayyéAXwv). To the priests who directed the 
sacrifices and pronounced release from the vow. 


Fulfilment—until, etc. There is some dispute and confu- 
sion here as to the precise meaning. The general sense is that, 
having entered the temple toward the close of the period re- 
quired for the fulfilment of these men’s vow, he gave notice 
that the vowed number of Nazarite days had expired, after 
which only the concluding offering was required 


27. Asia. See on ch. ii. 9. 


Stirred up (cuvéyeov). Only here in New Testament. Lit., 
poured together, threw into confusion. See on confounded, ch. 
ii. 6; and confusion, ch. xix. 29. 


98. This place. The temple. Compare the charge against 
Stephen, ch. vi. 13. 


Greeks. Seeon ch. vi. 1. 


Temple (iepdv). See on Matt. iv. 5. The Jews evidently 
meant to create the impression that Paul had introduced Gen- 
tiles into the inner court, which was restricted to the Jews. The 
temple proper was on the highest of a series of terraces which 
rose from the outer court, or Court of the Gentiles. In this 
outer court any stranger might worship. Between this and the 
terraces was a balustrade of stone, with columns at intervals, on 
which Greek and Latin inscriptions warned all Gentiles against 
advancing farther on pain of death. Beyond this balustrade 
rose a flight of fourteen steps to the first platform, on which was 
the Court of the Women, surrounded by a wall. In this court 
were the treasury, and various chambers, in one of which the 
Nazarites performed their vows. It was here that the Asiatic 
Jews discovered Paul.

29. Trophimus. See on ch. xx. 4. As an Ephesian he 
would be known to the Asiatic Jews. 


30. Drew him out of thetemple. Better, as Rev., dragged 
(etAxov). Out of the sacred enclosure and down the steps to the 
outer court, as they would not defile the temple proper with 
blood. 


The doors were shut. Between the inner and outer courts. 


31. Chief captain (yiAvdpy). A commander of a thousand 
men. See on Mark vi. 21; and on centurion, Luke vii. 2. 


Band (o7reipns). Or cohort. See on Mark xv. 16. These 
troops were quartered in the tower of Antonia, which was at 
the northwestern corner of the temple-area, and communicated 
with the temple-cloisters by staircases. 


32. Centurions. See on Luke vii. 2. 
Unto them (ez avrovs). Better, wpon them. 


33. Chains (advoeor). See on Mark v. 4. 


34. Castle (mwapeuwPBoryjv). Better, barracks. The main 
tower had a smaller tower at each corner, the one at the south- 
eastern corner being the largest and overlooking the temple. In 
this tower were the quarters of the soldiers. The word is de- 
rived from the verb wapepSdrro, to put in beside, used in mil- 
itary language of distributing auxiliaries among regular troops 
and, generally, of drawing up in battle-order. Hence the noun 
means, @ body drawn up in batile-array, and passes thence 
into the meaning of an encampment, soldiers’ quarters, barracks. 
In Heb. xi. 34, it occurs in the earlier sense of an army ; and in 
Heb. xiii. 11, 13; Apoc. xx. 9, in the sense of an encampment. 
In grammatical phraseology it signifies a parenthesis, according 
to its original sense of ¢nsertzon or interpolation. 


Cu. XX1] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 569 


35. Stairs. Leading from the temple-court to the tower. 
There were two flights, one to the northern and the other to 
the western cloister, so that the guard could go different ways 
among the cloisters in order to watch the people at the Jewish 
festivals. 


So it was (cvvé8n). Lit., zt happened. The verb means, lit- 
erally, to come together; hence, of a coincidence of events. It is 
designedly introduced here to express more vividly the fact of 
the peculiar emergency and the peril of Paul’s situation. Things 
came to such @ pass that he had to be carried up the stairs. 


37. Canst thou speak (ywecxes). Lit., dost thou know ? 
So Rev. 


38. Art thou not (ov« dpa od ¢i). Indicating the officer’s 
surprised recognition of his own mistake. “Thou art not, then, 
as I supposed.” Rev. properly adds then (apa). 


The Egyptian. A false prophet, who, in the reign of Nero, 
when Felix was governor of Judaea, collected a multitude of 
thirty thousand, whom he led from the wilderness to the Mount 
of Olives, saying that the walls of Jerusalem would fall down 
at his command and give them free entrance to the city. Felix 
with an army dispersed the multitude, and the Egyptian him- 
self escaped. There is a discrepancy in the number of fol- 
lowers as stated by Josephus (30,000) and as stated by the 
commandant here (4,000). It is quite possible, however, that 
Josephus alludes to the whole rabble, while Lysias is referring 
only to the armed followers. 


Madest an uproar. Better, as Rev., stirred up to sedition. 
The rendering of the A. V. is too vague. The verb means to 
unsettle or wpset, and the true idea is given in the A. V. of Acts 
xvii. 6, have turned the world upside down. Compare Gal. v. 
12, and kindred words in Mark xv. 7; Luke Xxit. 19; 


That were murderers (tev cixapiwv). The A. V. is too 


570 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.  [Cu. XXIL 


general, and overlooks the force of the article, which shows that 
the word refers toa class. Rev., rightly, the assassins. The 
word, which occurs only here, and notably on the lips of a 
Roman officer, is one of those Latin words which “followed the 
Roman domination even into those Eastern provinces of the em- 
pire which, unlike those of the West, had refused to be Latin- 
ized, but still retained their own language” (Trench, “Syn- 
onyms”). The Sicarii were so called from the weapon which 
they used—the séca, or short, curved dagger. J osephus says: 
“There sprang up in Jerusalem another description of robbers 
called Sikars, who, under the broad light of day, and in the very 
heart of the city, assassinated men; chiefly at the festivals, 
however, when, mixing among the crowd, with daggers con- 
cealed under their cloaks, they stabbed those with whom they 
were at variance. When they fell, the murderers joined in the 
general expressions of indignation, and by this plausible pro- 
ceeding remained undetected” (“Jewish War,” c. xiii.). The 
general New Testament term for murderer is goveds (see Matt. 
xxii. 7; Acts iii. 14; xxviii. 4, etc.). 

39. Mean (donjpov). Lit., without a mark or token (cha). 
Hence used of uncoined gold or silver: of oracles which give no 
intelligible response: of inarticulate voices: of disease without 
distinctive symptoms. Generally, as here, wndestengueshed, 
mean. There is a conscious feeling of patriotism in Paul’s ex- 
pression. 


40. Beckoned with the hand. Compare ch. xxvi. 1. 


Tongue (d:aréxt@). Lit., dealect: the language spoken by 
the Palestinian Jews—a mixture of Syriac and Chaldaic.

3. At the feet. Referring to the Jewish custom of the 
pupils sitting on benches or on the floor, while the teacher oc- 
cupied an elevated platform. 


Gamaliel. One of the seven Rabbis to whom the Jews 
gave the title Rabban. ab, “teacher,” was the lowest degree ; 
Rabbi, “my teacher,’ the next higher; and Labban, “our 
teacher,” the highest. Gamaliel was a liberal Pharisee. ‘“ As 
Aquinas among the schoolmen was called Doctor Angelicus, 
and Bonaventura Doctor Seraphicus, so Gamaliel was called 
the Beauty of the Law. He had no antipathy to the Greek 
learning. Candor and wisdom seem to have been features of 
his character ” (Conybeare and Howson). See ch. v. 34 sq. 


Instructed (creraidevpévos). See on chastise, Luke xxiii. 16. 


According to the perfect manner (cata axpiBeav). Lit.,

Zealous ({7A@77s). Or a zealot. On the word as a title, see

plains the apparent discrepancy with ch. ix. 7.

11. For the glory of that light. The cause of his blind- 
ness is not stated in ch. ix. 


12. A devout man, ete. In ch. ix. 10, he is called a ds- 
ciple. Paul here “ affirms that he was not introduced to Chris- 
tianity by an opponent of Judaism, but by a strict Jew” 
(Gloag). 


13. Stood (éricrds). More correctly, as Rev., “standing 
by (ér).” 


Receive thy sight (avaBrewov). Better, look up. See the 
following words: J looked up upon him. The word admits of 
both translations, to look up and to recover sight. 


| looked up upon him. Some unite both meanings here: 
L looked up with recovered sight. So Rev., in margin. 


14. The God of our fathers—Just One. A conciliatory 
touch in Paul’s speech, mentioning both God and Christ by 
their Jewish names. Oompare ch. iii. 14; vii. 52.

come, rather than the simple to be. On trance, see note on 
astonishment, Mark v. 42; and compare note on Acts x. 10. 


20. Martyr. Better, as Rev., witness. The special sense of 
the word was probably not in use at this time. See on ch. i. 
22. It occurs, however, in Apoc. ii. 18; xvii. 6.

fully avoided, but which it was impossible for him to avoid any 
longer, was enough. . . . The word ‘Gentiles,’ confirm- 
ing all their worst suspicions, fell like a spark on the inflam- 
mable mass of their fanaticism” (Farrar, “ Life and Work of 


Paul”). 


22. They gave him audience (ijcovov). The imperfect. 
Up to this word they were listening. 


Lifted up their voice, etc. “Then began one of the most 
odious and despicable spectacles which the world can witness, 
the spectacle of an oriental mob, hideous with impotent rage, 
howling, yelling, cursing, gnashing their teeth, flinging about 
their arms, waving and tossing their blue and red robes, casting 
dust into the air by handfuls, with all the furious gesticulations 
of an uncontrolled fanaticism” (Farrar). Hackett cites Sir 
John Chardin (“Travels into Persia and the East Indies”) as 
saying that it is common for the peasants in Persia, when they 
have a complaint to lay before their governors, to repair to 
them by hundreds or a thousand at once. They place them- 
selves near the gate of the palace, where they suppose they are 
most likely to be seen and heard, and there set up a horrid out- 
cry, rend their garments, and throw dust into the air, at the 
same time demanding justice. Compare 2 Sam. xvi. 13. 


24. Examined (dverdfec9ar). Only here and ver. 29. Not 
found in classical Greek. Apocrypha, Susanna, ver. 14. 


By scourging (udorEw). Lit., wath scowrges. 


574. WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XXIII 


25. Bound him with thongs (mpoéreway adtov Tots (wacw). 
Against the rendering of the A. V. is the word mpoérewar, they 
stretched forward, in allusion to the position of the victim for 
scourging, and the article with thongs ; “the thongs,” with ref- 
erence to some well-known instrument. If the words referred 
simply to binding him, wth thongs would be superfluous. It 
is better, therefore, to take thongs as referring to the scourge, 
consisting of one or more lashes or cords, a sense in which it 
occurs in classical Greek, and to render stretched him out for 
(or before) the thongs. The word is used elsewhere in the New 
Testament of a shoe-latchet (Mark i. 7; Luke iii. 16; Johni. 27). 


Roman. See on ch. xvi. 37. 


28. Sum (xedaraiov). Lit., capital. The purchase of Ro- 
man citizenship was an investment. Under the first Roman 
emperors it was obtained only at large cost and with great diffi- 
culty; later, it was sold for a trifle. 


| was free-born (éy@ Kai yeyévvnuat). Lit., J am even so 
born, leaving the mind to supply free or a Loman. Better, as 
Rev., Jam a Roman born.

Sanhedrim: probably not their usual place of assembly, which 
lay within the wall of partition, which Lysias and his soldiers 
would not have been allowed to pass.

hold that Paul’s eyesight was defective, explain this steadfast 
look in connection with his imperfect vision. 


Men and brethren. He addresses the Sanhedrim as an 
equal. 


Ihave lived (aezoAfrevpar). Lit., have lived as a citizen, 


Cu. XXIII.) THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 575 


with special reference to the charge against him that he taught 
men against the law and the temple. He means that he has 
lived as a true and loyal Jew. 


Conscience (cuverdjcer). See on 1 Pet. iii. 16. 


2. Ananias. He is described as a revengeful and rapacious 
tyrant. Weare told that he reduced the inferior priests almost 
to starvation by defrauding them of their tithes, and sent his 
creatures to the threshing-floors with bludgeons to seize the 
tithes by force. 


3. Shall smite thee (rirrew ce pédrev). More strictly, zs 
about to smite. The words are not an imprecation, but a 
prophecy of punishment for his violent dealing. According to 
Josephus, in the attack of the Sicarii upon Jerusalem, he was 
dragged from his hiding-place, in a sewer of the palace, and 
murdered by assassins. 


Thou whited wall. Compare Matt. xxiii. 277. 


Contrary to the law (aapavoudv). A verb. Lit., trans- 
gressing the law. 


4. Revilest (Nocdopeis). The word signifies vehement abuse, 
scolding, berating. 


6. The one part were Sadducees, etc. Perceiving the 
impossibility of getting a fair hearing, Paul, with great tact, 
seeks to bring the two parties of the council into collision with 
each other. 


The resurrection. A main point of contention between 
the Pharisees and Sadducees, the latter of whom denied the 
doctrine of the resurrection, of a future state, and of any 
spiritual existence apart from the body. 


8. Both. Showing that ¢wo classes of doctrines peculiar to 


576 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu XXIII 


the Sadducees, and not three, are meant: 1. The resurrection. 
2. The existence of spirits, whether angels or souls of men ; 
“neither angel nor spirit.” 


9. Strove. The diversion was successful. The Pharisees’ 
hatred of the Sadducees was greater than their hatred of 
Christianity. 


What if a spirit, etc. Neither the A. V. nor Rey. give the 
precise form of this expression. The words form a broken 
sentence, followed by a significant silence, which leaves the 
hearers to supply the omission for themselves: ‘‘ But if a spirit 
or angel has spoken to him———” ‘The words which the A. V. 
supplies to complete the sentence, det ws not fight against God, 
are spurious, borrowed from ch. v. 39. 


12. Banded together (coiujcavtes cvotpopiy). Lit., having 
made a conspiracy. See on concourse, ch. xix. 40. 


Bound themselves under a curse (dveJewdticay éavrovs). 
Lit., anathematized or cursed themselves ; invoked God’s curse 
on themselves if they should violate their vow. On the kindred 
noun avaddeua, a curse, see note on offerings, Luke xxi. 5. In 
case of failure, they could procure absolution from their oath 
by the Rabbis. 


13. Conspiracy (cvvwpociar). Lit., swearing together; con- 
juration. According to its etymology, conspiracy is a breath- 
ing or blowing together (Latin, conspirare). Hence, of concerted 
thought and action. 


14. We have bound ourselves under a great curse (dva- 
Séuat. aveIeuaticapev éavtovs). Lit., we have anathematized 
ourselves with an anathema. A very strong expression. For 
similar expressions, see Luke xxii. 15; John iii. 29; Actsiv. 17. 


15. Enquire (dvaywoéocrew). Only here and ch. xxiv. 22. 
Originally, to distinguish or discern; hence, to decide, as a suit. 
Rev., more correctly, therefore, judge.

More perfectly (axpuBéorepov). Rev., better, more exactly. 
See on Luke i. 3; Acts xviii. 25, 26. 


Concerning him (ra zrepi avdrod). Lit., the things about him. 
Rev., better, Ais case. 


18. The prisoner (0 décyc0s). From &€, to bind. Paul, as 
a Roman citizen, was held in custodia militaris, “ military cus- 
tody.” Three kinds of custody were recognized by the Roman 
law: 1. Custodia publica (public custody); confinement in the 
public jail. This was the worst kind, the common jails being 
wretched dungeons. Such was the confinement of Paul and 
Silas at Philippi. 2. Custodia libera (free custody), confined to 
men of high rank. The accused was committed to the charge 
of a magistrate or senator, who became responsible for his ap- 
pearance on the day of trial. 3. Custodia militaris (military 
custody). The accused was placed in charge of a soldier, who 
was responsible with his life for the prisoner’s safe-keeping, 
and whose left hand was secured by a chain to the prisoner’s 
right. The prisoner was usually kept in the barracks, but was 
sometimes allowed to reside in a private house under charge of 
his guard. 


21. Have bound themselves. “If we should wonder how, 
so early in the morning, after the long discussion in the Sanhe- 
drim, which must have occupied a considerable part of the day, 
more than forty men should have been found banded together, 
under an anathema, neither to eat nor to drink till they had 
killed Paul; and, still more, how such a conspiracy, or, rather, 
conjuration, which, in the nature of it, would be kept a profound 
secret, should have become known to Paul’s sister’s son—the 
circumstances of the case furnish a sufficient explanation. The 
Pharisees were avowedly a fraternity or guild; and they, or 
some of their kindred fraternities, would furnish the ready 
material for such a band, to whom this additional vow would be 
nothing new or strange, and, murderous though it sounded, 
only seem a further carrying out of the principles of their order. 
Again, since the wife and all the children of a member were 

37 


578 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XXIIL 


ipso facto members of the guild, and Paul’s father had been a 
Pharisee (ver. 6), Paul’s sister also would, by virtue of her birth, 
belong to the fraternity, even irrespective of the probability 
that, in accordance with the principles of the party, she would 
have married into a Pharisaical family ” (Edersheim, “ Jewish 
Social Life ”). 


23. Soldiers (erparudras). Heavy-armed footmen : legion- 
aries. 


Spearmen (Se£toAdBous). Only here in New Testament, and 
not in classical Greek. From de&s, right, and XAapBdve, to 
take. The exact meaning is uncertain. Some explain it as 
those who take the right side of the prisoners whom they have 
in charge ; others, those who grasp (their weapon) with the right 
hand ; others, again, those who hold (a second horse) by the 
right hand. They are here distinguished from the heavy-armed 
legionaries and the cavalry. They were probably light-armed 
troops, javelin-throwers or slingers. One of the principal man- 
uscripts reads SefsoBdrous, “those who throw with the right 
hand.” 


24. Beasts («r7jvn). See on Luke x. 34.

lency :” an official title. Compare ch. xxiv. 3; xxvi. 25. 


Greeting (yaipew). See on ch. xv. 23. 

27. Rescued. Bengel says, “a lie.” lLysias wishes to make

cuing him; whereas he did not know of this until afterward. 


He says nothing about the proposed scourging.

what kind of a province;” whether senatorial or imperial. 
See Introduction to Luke. Cilicia was an imperial province. 


35. | will hear thee (Ssaxovcouat). Better, as Rev., well 
hear thy cause ; the word meaning “to hear fully (oud) in a

now a Roman province, the palace of its former kings had be- 
come the governor’s official residence. It thus appears that 
Paul was leniently dealt with, and not cast into the common 
prison. 


OHAPTER XXIV. 


1. An orator (frropos). An advocate. The Jews, being 
little acquainted with Roman forms and laws, had to employ 
Roman advocates. 


580 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. ([Cu. XXIV. 


3. Very worthy deeds (xatopdwpdtov). From KaTopsow, to 
set upright. Hence, a success consequent on right judgment ; 
a right action. The best texts, however, read dsopIwpator, 
settings right ; amendments. Thus the sentence reads, literally, 
obtaining much peace through thee, and amendments taking 
place for this nation through thy providence, we accept, ete. 


Providence (mpovolas). Forethought. Providentia Avu- 
gusti (the providence of the emperor) was a common title on the 
coins of the emperors. 


4. Be tedious (éyxérrw). See on hindered, 1 Pet. iii. 7. 
The meaning is, rather, “that I may not further hinder thee, or 
detain thee. 


Clemency (émvexeia). See on gentle, 1 Pet. ii. 18. 


A few words (cuvtéueas). Lit., concisely. From ovvrépve, 
to cut down or cut short. 


5. Pestilent fellow (Aocuov). Lit., a plague or pest. 


Ringleader (1pwtocrdtnv). Originally, one who stands first 
on the right of a line; a@ file-leader. Thus Thucydides says 
that all armies when engaging are apt to thrust outward their 
right wing; and adds, “ The jirst man in the front rank 
(6 mpwtoctarns) of the right wing is originally responsible for 
the deflection” (v., 71). Here, of course, metaphorically, as 
A. V. and Rev. Only here in New Testament. 


Sect (aipécews). See on heresies, 2 Pet. ii. 1. 


Nazarenes. ‘The only passage in scripture where this term 
is used to denote the Christians. See on Matt. ii. 23. 


6. To profane (Be8nrAdca). The word is akin to Anvddos, 
threshold, and Paiva, to step; and its fundamental idea, there- 
fore, is that of overstepping the threshold of sacred places. The 


Cu. XXIV.] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 581 


word profane is the Latin pro fanum, in front of the sanctuary ; 
that which is kept outside the fane because unholy. 


We laid hold. The best texts omit all after these words as 
far as by examining. 


8. From whom. Paul. It would refer to Lysias if the 
omitted passage above were retained. 


9. Assented (cvvéSert0). But the best texts read ovverré- 
Sevto, jointly set upon or assailed. So Rev., joined in the 
charge. 


10. The more cheerfully (edIupudrepov). The best texts 
read the positive of the adverb, evdvpos, cheerfully. 


14. The way. See on ch. ix. 2. 


A sect. See on ver. 5. The word is commonly used in an 
indifferent sense, as signifying merely a school or party. So 
ch. xv. 5; xxviii. 22. Here, however, in a bad sense—a schis- 
matic sect, as in 1 Cor. xi. 19. 


Worship (Aatpedw). Better, as Rev., serve. See on Luke 
i, TA. 


God of my fathers (76 watpdm Oem). A familiar classical 
phrase, and therefore well known to Felix. Thus Demosthenes 
calls Apollo the watpdos (ancestral god) of Athens. Socrates 
is asked (Plato, “ Euthydemus,” 302), “ Have you an ancestral 
Zeus (Zeds ratp@os)?” So, frequently, in the classics. Simi- 
larly, the Roman phrase, Di patria, “the gods of the forefa- 
thers.” On the Roman reverence for the ancestral religion, see 
note on ch. xvi. 21. The Roman’s own sentiment would pre- 
pare him to respect Paul’s. 


15. Allow (mpocdéyovra). Or, as Rev., look for. The word 
admits of either sense. 


582 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca XXIV. 


16. Exercise myself (doxo). Originally, to work raw ma- 
terial, to form: hence, to practise, exercise, discipline ; and so, 
in ecclesiastical language, to mortify the body. Of the kindred 
adjective doxnticds, our word ascetic is a transcript. 


Void of offence (drpockorov). Lit., without stumbling ; un- 
shaken. The word is used thus in a passive sense here, as in 
Philip. i. 10. In 1 Cor. x. 82, it oceurs in the actwe sense of 
giving offence to others, or causing them to stumble. 


18. Whereupon (év ofs). More correctly, in which (occupa- 
tion) ; while so engaged. The best texts, however, read év ais, 
in which, the pronoun agreeing in gender with offerings. The 
sense, according to this, is, as Rev., margin, 7n presenting which 


(offerings). 


22. Deferred (adveBadero). Adjourned the case. Only here 
in New Testament. 


| will know the uttermost (dvayvecoua:). Better, as Rev., 
I will determine. See on ch. xxiii. 15. 


23. Liberty (aveow). From avinut, to send up ; thence, to 
loosen, release. It is almost exactly expressed by our vulgarism, 
to let up. The noun here is more correctly rendered by Rey., 
indulgence. In all the other New Testament passages it is ren- 
dered rest, ease, or relief. See 2 Cor. ii. 13; vii. 5; viii. 18; 2 
Thess. i. 7. 


To minister (vwnperetv). See on officer, Matt. v. 25. 


25. Righteousness, temperance, the judgment to come. 
Three topics which bore directly upon the character of Felix. 
Tacitus says of him that he “exercised the authority of a king 
with the spirit of a slave ;” and that, by reason of the powerful 
influence at his command, “he supposed he might perpetrate 
with impunity every kind of villany.” He had persuaded his 
wife Drusilla to forsake her husband and marry him. He had 


Cu. XXV.] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 583 


employed assassins to murder the high-priest Jonathan, and 
might well tremble at the preaching of the judgment to come. 
Temperance (éyxpateva) is, properly, self-control ; holding the 
passions in hand. 


Trembled (udoBos yevduevos). Lit., having become in fear. 
Rev., better, was terrified. 


For this time (rd viv éyov). Or, for the present. Very 
literally, as to what has ttself now. 


26. He hoped also (dua Sé xa édrrifwv). A comma should 
be placed after thee (ver. 25), and the participle édaion, hoping, 
joined with answered: “ Felix answered, ‘Go thy way, CLC, 
hoping withal that money would be given him.” 


Communed (auirec). See on talked, ch. xx. 11. 


27. Porcius Festus came into Felix’s room (édaBe Sua- 
Soxyov 6 PAE TIépxvov Pforov). Kev., better, Feliz was suc- 
ceeded by Porcius Festus. The Greek idiom is, Melix received 
Porcius Festus as a successor. 


To shew the Jews a pleasure (ydpitas xatatéodar Tots 
"Iovdalois). Lit., to lay up thanks for himself with the Jews. 
Rev., correctly, to gain favor with the Jews. 


CHAPTER XX V. 


1. Was come into the province (éiBas rh érapyia). Lit., 
having entered upon the province. 


9. Besought. The imperfect denotes their persistence: 
kept beseeching. 


3. Laying wait (évédpav rovodvres). Lit., making or arrang- 
ing an ambush. 


584 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu XXV. 


4. Should be kept (rnpetoIar). This puts it as a peremp- 
tory denial of the Jews’ request by Festus; whereas it is only 
his statement of a fact. Render,as Rev., that Paul was kept 
in charge. Festus’ reply is conciliatory, and is put on the ground 
of convenience. 


6. Judgment-seat. See on ch. vii. 5. 


8. Have I offended (juaprov). See on the kindred noun 
dpaptia, sin, Matt. i. 21. 


9. Doapleasure. See on ch. xxiv. 27. MRev., better, to 
gain favor. 


Before me (é7’ euov). Not with him as judge, but by the 
Sanhedrim in his presence. 


10. Very well («ddAdov). The force of the comparative 
should be preserved : “thou knowest better than thy question 
implies.” 


11. Deliver (xapicacJar). With an underlying sense of giv- 
ing him up as @ favor to the Jews. 


| appeal (émcxadodpar). The technical phrase for lodging an 
appeal. The Greek rendering of the Latin formula appello. 


12. The council. A body of men chosen by the governor 
himself from the principal Romans of the province. These 
were called assessors, sometimes friends, sometimes captains. 
Though a Roman citizen had the right of appeal to the emperor, 
a certain discretion was allowed the governors of provinces as 
to admitting the appeal. It might be disallowed if the affair 
did not admit of delay, or if the appellant were a known robber 
or pirate. In doubtful cases the governor was bound to consult 
with his council, and his failure to do so exposed him to censure. 
Cicero, in his impeachment of Verres, the brutal governor of 
Sicily, says: “Will you deny that you dismissed your council, 


Cu. XXV.] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 585 


the men of rank with whom your predecessor and yourself had 
been wont to consult, and decided the case yourself?” (ii., 33). 
That Festus exercised this discretion in Paul’s case is shown by 
his conferring with the council. 


13. Agrippa the king. Herod Agrippa IIL., son of the 
Herod whose death is recorded in Acts xii. 20-23. 


Bernice. Sister of Drusilla, the wife of Felix. She is said 
to have lived in incestuous relations with her brother. Juvenal, 
in his sixth satire, alludes to this: “A most notable diamond, 
made more precious by having been worn on the finger of Ber- 
nice. This a barbarian king once gave to his incestuous love. 
This Agrippa gave to his sister.” 


16. Opportunity (ré7ov). Lit., place. An unclassical use 
of the word. 


18. Stood up (cra3évtes). See on Luke xviii. 11; xix. 8. 


19. Superstition (SevcvSauovias). See on ch. xvii. 22. Ber- 
ter, religion, as Rev. As Agrippa was a Jew by religion, Fes- 
tus would not have insulted him by applying the word super- 
stition to his faith. Note, however, that he speaks of it as 
their own religion, not identifying Agrippa with them. It was 
anon-committal expression, since the word meant either religion 
or superstition according to circumstances. He left Agrippa 
“to take the word in a good sense, but reserved his own view, 
which was certainly the Roman one” (Meyer). There is, in- 
deed, a similar tact in Paul’s use of the word to the Athenians. 
He selected “a word which almost imperceptibly shaded off 
from praise to blame” (Trench).* 





* ¢¢Bernhardy very aptly remarks that the entrance of the word decrdamovla 
marks a critical point in the history of the life of the Greek people. Itmarks 
the wavering between scepticism and despondency. It leaves the conception 
of the object of religious reverence wavering between God and demon, and 
thus fearing becomes the dominant notion. Hence the word carries more re- 
proach than credit” (Zeschwitz, Profangricitat und Biblischer Sprachgeist ). 


586 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XXVI 


Affirmed (é¢acxev). The imperfect implies something ha- 
bitual. “ Paul kept asserting.” 


21. Of the Emperor (rod SeBacrod). Lit., the august one ; 
hence a translation of Augustus, which was not a proper name, 
but a title of the Roman emperors. 


26. Lord («cvpém). An instance of Luke’s accuracy. The 
title “lord ” was refused by the first two emperors, Augustus 
and Tiberius. The emperors who followed accepted it. In the 
time of Domitian it was a recognized title. Antoninus Pius was 
the first who put it on his coins. 


27. Crimes (airias). Rev., more correctly, charges. 


CHAPTER XX VI. 
2. Happy (uaxdpiov). See on blessed, Matt. v. 3. 
Answer (azronoyeio Sar). See on 1 Pet. iii. 15. 
3. Expert (yvoorny). Lit., a knower. 
Questions (f)Tnudtwv). See on ch. xv. 2. 


4. My manner of life, etc. The repeated articles give ad- 
ditional precision to the statement: ‘the manner of life, that 
which was frommy youth; that which was from the beginning.” 


6. For the hope (ém’ éAmriés).  Lit., “on the ground of the 
hope.” 


Made of God. The article clearly defines what promise, 
“the one, namely, made of God.” 


7. Twelve tribes (Swdexdgpudov). Only here in New Testa- 
ment. <A collective term, embracing the tribes as a whole. 
Meyer renders owr twelve-tribe-stock. 


Cx. XXVI] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 587 


_ Instantly (év éxreveia). Only here in New Testament. Lit., 
in intensity. See on fervently, 1 Pet. i. 22. Compare more 
earnestly, Luke xxii. 44; without ceasing, Acts xii. 5; fervent, 
1 Pet. iv. 8. See, also, on instantly and mstant, Luke vii. 4; 
xxiii. 23. 


Serving. Compare ch. xxiv. 14; and see on Luke i. 74. 


Come (xatavtijca). Lit., to arrive at, as if at a goal. Com- 
pare ch. xvi. 1; xviii. 19; xxv. 13, etc. Rev. attain. 


8. That God should raise the dead (ei 0 Ocds vexpovs 
éyeiper). Much better, as Rev., if God raises the dead. He does 
not put it asa supposition, but asa fact: ¢f God raises the dead, 
as you admit that he has the power to do, and as your own writ- 
ings tell you that he has done. 


10. Saints (Trav dyiov). Lit., the holy ones. Paul did not 
eall the Christians by this name when addressing the Jews, for 
this would have enraged them; but before Agrippa he uses the 
word without fear of giving offence. On this word ayios, holy, 
which occurs over two hundred times in the New Testament, it 
is to be noted how the writers of the Greek scriptures, both in 
the New Testament and, what is more remarkable, in the Sep- 
tuagint, bring it out from the background in which it was left 
by classical writers, and give preference to it over words which, 
in pagan usage, represented conceptions of mere externality in 
religion. Even in the Old Testament, where externality 1s em- 
phasized, dytos is the standard word for holy.* 





* Thus, though the priest is fepeds, the holy place is 7d &yioy, and the most 
holy place, 7a ayia ray arylov: iepdy is never used in the Septuagint for the 
temple, except in 1 Chron. xxix. 4; Ezek. xlv. 19; and in both cases the 
temple is referred to in its outward aspect. In Ezek. xxvii. 6; xxviii. 18, 
ra iepd is used of the heathen sanctuaries of Tyre. In the New Testament 
iepds never implies moral excellence. Excepting in the neuter form, 7d fepdr, 
the temple, it occurs but twice (1 Cor. ix. 18; 2 Tim. iii. 15), and is never used 
ofa person. Seuvds is reverend ; aryvds, pure, in the sense of chastity, freedom 
from admixture of evil; and is applied once to God himself (1 John ili. 3). 
“Oguos is holy by sanction. Trench remarks the sharp distinction maintained 


588 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca. XXVE 


Gave my voice (xarjveyxca Widov). Lit., laid down my 
vote. See on cownteth, Luke xiv. 28. Some suppose that Paul 
here refers to casting his vote as a member of the Sanhedrim ; 
in which case he must have been married and the father of a 
family. But this there is no reason for believing (compare 1 
Cor. vii. 7, 8); and the phrase may be taken as expressing 
merely moral assent and approval. 


12. Whereupon (év ois). See on ch. xxiv. 18. Better, on 
which errand ; in which affairs of persecution. 


13. Above the brightness of the sun. Peculiar to this 
third account of Paul’s conversion. The other peculiarities are: 
the falling of his companions to the ground along with himself ; 
the voice addressing him in Hebrew; and the words, “It is 
hard for thee to kick against the pricks.” 


14. It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. Or, 
goads. The sharp goad carried in the ploughman’s hand, against 
which the oxen kick on being pricked. The metaphor, though 
not found in Jewish writings, was common in Greek and Ro- 
man writings. Thus, Euripides (“ Bacchae,” 791): “ Being en- 
raged, I would kick against the goads, a mortal against a god.” 
Plautus (“Truculentus, 4, 2, 55): “If you strike the goads 
with your fists, you hurt your hands more than the goads.” 
“Who knows whether at that moment the operation of plough- 
ing might not be going on within sight of the road along which 
the persecutor was travelling? (Howson, “ Metaphors of St. 
Paul”). 


16. Have I appeared (d¢9nv). See on Luke xxii. 43. 


To make (poxetpicacda). Better, as Rev., appoint. See 
on ch. iii. 20. 





by the Septuagint translators between it and &yos; the two words being used 
to render two different Hebrew words, and never interchanged. The Greek 
student will find an interesting discussion of this subject in Zeschwitz, Pro 
fangracitét und Biblischer Sprachgeist. 


Cu. XXVL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 589 


A minister and a witness. See on Matt. v. 25; Acts i. 22. 
17. The people. The Jews. 


22. Help of God (érixovpias tis mapa tod Oeod). Lit., 
“help that 7s from God.” The article defines the nature of the 
help more sharply than A. V. The word for help originally 
meant alliance. 


23. That Christ should suffer (ei mantos 0 Xpictos). 
Rather, ¢7f or whether the Messiah is liable to suffering. He 
expresses himself in a problematic form, because it was the 
point of debate among the Jews whether a suffering Messiah 
was to be believed in. They believed in a triumphant Mes- 
siah, and the doctrine of his sufferings was an obstacle to their 
receiving him as Messiah. Note the article, “the Christ,” and 
see on Matt. i. 1. 


24. Much learning doth make thee mad (7a zoddd ce 
ypdppara eis paviay trepitpére). The A. V. omits the article 
with much learning: “the much knowledge ” with which thou 
art busied. Rev., “thy much learning.” Doth make thee mad: 
literally, is turning thee to madness. 


25. Speak forth (azopIéyyouas). See on ch. ii. 4. 


28. Almost thou persuadest (€v oAdly@ pe treiJeus). Lit., in 
alittle thou persuadest. The rendering almost must be rejected, 
being without sufficient authority. The phrase, im a little, is 
adverbial, and means in brief; summarily. We may supply 
pains or talk. “ With little pains, or with a few words.” The 
words are ironical, and the sense is, “ You are trying to per- 
suade me off hand to be a Christian.” Thou persuadest (meideus) 
is, rather, thou art for persuading ; thou attemptest to persuade ; 
a force which both the present and the imperfect sometimes 
have.* 





* Asin John x. 32: ‘‘ For which of these works ave you for stoning me (Aiwd- 
ere)?” John xiii. 6: ‘‘ Dost thou mean to wash (vimreis) my feet?” Luke 
1.59: “They were for calling (éxédovy) him Zacharias.” Matt, iii. 14: ‘John 
tried to prevent (S:exddrvey).”

29. Almost and altogether (év od’ym Kai év peyado).* 
Lit., in little and in great ; i.e., with little or with great pains. 


Were (yevéoJas). Better, as Rev., might become. Agrippa’s 
word, ‘to become a Christian,” is repeated. 


Except these bonds. An exquisite touch of Christian cour- 
tesy. 


30. The king, the governor, Bernice. Mentioned in the 
order of their rank. 


31. Doeth. Referring, not to Paul’s past conduct, but to the 
general character of his life. 


CHAPTER XX VII. 
1. Sail (azromheiv). Lit., sacl away. 
Band. See on Mark xv. 16. 


2. Meaning to sail (wéAXovtes wAciv). This refers the in- 
tention to the voyagers ; but the best texts read wéAXovTe, agree- 
ing with wAotw, shep ; so that the correct rendering is, as Rev., 
a ship—which was about to sail. 


8. Touched (xatjyInyuev). From card, down, and dye, to 
lead or bring. To bring the ship down from deep water to the 
land. Opposed to dviyInuwev, put to sea (ver. 2); which is to 
bring the vessel wp (avd) from the land to deep water. See on 
Luke viii. 22. Youched is an inferential rendering. Landed 
would be quite as good. From Caesarea to Sidon, the distance 
was about seventy miles. 


Courteously (¢iAavdpérws). Only here in New Testament. 
Lit., in @ man-loving way ; humanely ; kindly. Rev., kindly, 





* So the best texts, instead of roaag, much. 


Cu. XXVIL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 591 


better than courteously. Courteous, from court, expresses rather 
polish of manners than real kindness. 


To refresh himself (éaiperelas tuyeiv). Lit., to recede care 
or attention. 


4. We sailed under (i7emAcvoaper). Rev., correctly, under 
the lee of: under the protection of the land. 


6. A ship of Alexandria. Employed in the immense corn 
trade between Italy and Egypt. See ver. 38. The size of the 
vessel may be inferred from ver. 37. 


7. Many (‘cavais). See on Luke vii. 6. 


Scarce (uorus). Incorrect. Render, as Rev., with difficulty. 
So, also, hardly, in ver. 8. The meaning is not that they had 
scarcely reached Cnidus when the wind became contrary, nor that 
they had come only as far as Cnidus in many days; but that they 
were retarded by contrary winds between Myra and Cnidus, a 
distance of about one hundred and thirty miles, which, with a 
favorable wind, they might have accomplished in a day. Such 
a contrary wind would have been the northwesterly, which pre- 
vails during the summer months in that part of the Archi- 
pelago. 


9. The Fast. The great day of atonement, called “the 
Fast ” by way of eminence. It occurred about the end of Sep- 
tember. Navigation was considered unsafe from the beginning 
of November until the middle of March. 


10. I perceive (Sewpa). As the result of careful observa- 
tion. See on Luke x. 18. 


Hurt (&8pews). The word literally means insolence, injury, 
and is used here metaphorically : insolence of the winds and 
waves, “like our ‘sport’ or ‘riot’ of the elements” (Hackett). 
Some take it literally, with presumption, as indicating the folly 


592 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XXVIL 


of undertaking a voyage at that season ; but the use of the word 
in ver. 21 is decisive against this. 


Damage (&uias). Better, as Rev., loss. Hurt and damage 
(A. V.) is tautological. See on the kindred verb, notes on Jose, 
Matt. xvi. 26, and cast away, Luke ix. 25. 


11. Master (cuGepyyty). Only here and Apoc. xviii. 17. 
Lit., the steersman. 


12. Not commodious (avev%érov). Lit., not well situated. 


Lieth toward the southwest and northwest (@dé7rovra 
kata AiBa Kat kata Xepov). Instead of lieth, Rev., literally 
and correctly, renders looking. The difference between the 
Rev. and A. V., as to the points of the compass, turns on the 
rendering of the preposition card. The words southwest and 
northwest mean, literally, the southwest and northwest winds. 
According to the A. V., «ard means toward, and has reference 
to the quarter from which these winds blow. According to the 
Rev., card means down: “looking down the southwest and 
northwest winds,” 2.¢., in the direction toward which they blow, 
viz., northeast and southeast. This latter view assumes that 
Phenice and Lutro are the same, which is uncertain. For full 
discussion of the point, see Smith, “ Voyage and Shipwreck of 
St. Paul;” Hackett, “Commentary on Acts;” Conybeare and 
Howson, “ Life and Epistles of St. Paul.” 


13. Loosing thence (apavres). Lit., having taken up. It 
is the nautical phrase for weighing anchor. So Rev. 


14. There arose against it ({8anre Kar’ adrfs). Against 
what? Some say, the island of Crete; in which case they 
would have been driven against the island, whereas we are told 
that they were driven away from it. Others, the ship. It is 
objected that the pronoun avdrijs, tt, is feminine, while the 
feminine noun for ship (vais) is not commonly used by Luke, 
but rather the neuter, wAofov. I do not think this objection 


Cu. XXVIL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 593 


entitled to much weight. Luke is the only New Testament 
writer who uses vads (see ver. 41), though he uses it but once ; 
and, as Hackett remarks, “it would be quite accidental which 
of the terms would shape the pronoun at this moment, as they 
were both so familiar.’ A third explanation refers the pro- 
noun to the island of Crete, and renders, “there beat down 
from it.’ This is grammatical, and according toa well-known 
usage of the preposition. The verb 8dAXo is also used intran- 
sitively in the sense of to fall; thus Homer (“ Iliad,” xi., 722), 
of a river falling into the sea. Compare Mark iv. 87: “the 
waves beat (éméBadXev) into the ship ; ” and Luke xv. 12: “the 
portion of goods that falleth (émyBddXor) to me.” The rendering 
of the Rev. is, therefore, well supported, and, on the whole, 
preferable: there beat down from it. It is also according to 
the analogy of the expression in Luke viii. 23, there came down 
a storm. See note there, and on Matt. vill. 24. 


A tempestuous wind (dveuos tupavixds). Lit., a typhonie 
wind. The word tudav means a typhoon, and the adjective 
formed from it means of the character of a typhoon. 


Euroclydon (EvpoxAvéov). The best texts read Evpaxthon, 
Euraquilo: i.e. between Hurus, “the E.S.E. wind,” and 
Aquilo, “the north-wind, or, strictly, N. 4 E.” Hence, E. N. E. 


15. Bear up (dvtofJarpeiv). Only here in New Testament. 
From dvri, opposite, and dpIaruos, the eye. Lit., to look the 
wind in the eye. The ancient ships often had an eye painted 
on each side of the bow. To sail “into the eye of the wind” 
is a modern nautical phrase. 


We let her drive (émvddvres ehepopeda). Lit., having gwen 
up to it, we were borne along. 


16. We had much work to come by the boat (uonus ioxv- 
capyev Tepixpateis yevécIar Ths cxddns). Lit., we were with 
difficulty able to become masters of the boat: i.e., to secure on 
deck the small boat which, in calm weather, was attached by a 

38

rope to the vessel’s stern. Rev., we were able with difficulty to 
secure the boat. On with difficulty, see note on scarce, ver. 7. 


17. Helps (BonSefacs). Any apparatus on hand for the pur- 
pose: ropes, chains, ete. 


Undergirding (i7ofevvivtes). In modern nautical language, 
Frapping : passing cables or chains round the ship’s hull in 
order to support her in a storm. Mr. Smith (“ Voyage and 
Shipwreck of St. Paul”) cites the following from the account 
of the voyage of Captain George Back from the arctic regions 
in 1837: “A length of the stream chain-cable was passed under 
the bottom of the ship four feet before the mizzen-mast, hove 
tight by the capstan, and finally immovably fixed to six ring- 
bolts on the quarter-deck. The effect was at once manifest by 
a great diminution in the working of the parts already men- 
tioned ; and, in a less agreeable way, by impeding her rate of 
sailing.” 


Quicksands (77 ciptw). Therendering of the A. V. is too 
general. The word is a proper name, and has the article. 
There were two shoals of this name—the ‘ Greater Syrtis” 
(Syrtis Major), and the “Smaller Syrtis” (Syrtis Minor). It 
was the former upon which they were in danger of being 
driven ; a shallow on the African coast, between Tripoli and 
Barca, southwest of the island of Crete. 


Strake sail (yaddcavtes 70 cxevos). Lit., as Rev., lowered 
the gear. See on goods, Matt. xii. 29. It is uncertain what is 
referred to here. To strike sail, it is urged, would be a sure 
way of running upon the Syrtis, which they were trying to 
avoid. It is probably better to understand it generally of the 
gear connected with the fair-weather sails. ‘ Every ship sit- 
uated as this one was, when preparing for a storm, sends down 
upon deck the ‘ top-hamper,’ or gear connected with the fair- 
weather sails, such as the topsails. A modern ship sends down 
top-gallant masts and yards; a cutter strikes her topmast when 
preparing for a gale” (Smith, “Voyage,” etc.). The storm: 
sails were probably set. 


Cu. XXVIL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 595 


18. Lightened (€«8orrp érrovotvro). Lit., made a casting out. 
Rev., began to throw the freight overboard. Note the imper- 
fect, began to throw. The whole cargo was not cast overboard ; 
the wheat was reserved to the last extremity (ver. 38). 


19. Tackling (cxev7y). The word means equipment, furni- 
ture. The exact meaning here is uncertain. Some suppose it 
to refer to the main-yard ; an immense spar which would re- 
quire the united efforts of passengers and crew to throw over- 
board. It seems improbable, however, that they would have 
sacrificed so large a spar, which, in case of shipwreck, would 
support thirty or forty men in the water. The most generally 
received opinion is that it refers to the furniture of the ship— 
beds, tables, chests, etc. 


21. Hearkened (eIapyyjcavtas). See on obey, ch. v. 29. 
Loosed (avdyecIat). Rev., set sacl. See on Luke viii. 22. 
Harm (é8piv). See on ver. 10. 


23. The angel. Rev., correctly, an angel. There is no 
article. 


Of God (rod @eod). Rev., correctly, supplies the article : “the 
God,” added because Paul was addressing heathen, who would 
have understood by angel a messenger of the gods. 

27. Adria. The Adriatic Sea: embracing all that part of the 
Mediterranean lying south of Italy, east of Sicily, and west of ~ 
Greece. 


Deemed (izrevdour). Better, as Rev., suspected or surmised, 


That they drew near to some country.  Lit., that ‘some 
land is drawing near to them. 


30. Under color (popdce). Lit., on pretence. 


596 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cz. XXVIL 


Cast (exredvew). Lit., to stretch out. The meaning is, to 
carry out an anchor to a distance from the prow by means of 
the small boat. Rev., lay out. 


33. While the day was coming on (ayps é 05 Euedrev 
jpépa yvecSar). Lit., until it should become day : in the inter- 
val between midnight and morning. 


39. Bay («drzov). See on bosom, Luke vi. 38. 


Shore (aiysadov). See on Matt. xiii. 2. Better, as Rev., 
beach. 


They were minded (éSovdevcarto). Better,as Rev., took 
counsel. See on Matt. i. 19. 


40. Taken up (crepsedovtes). Wrong. The word means Zo 
remove, and refers here to cutting the anchor-cables, or castung 
off, as Rev. 


Committed themselves (eiwv). Wrong. The reference is 
tothe anchors. Reyv., correctly, deft them wm the sea. 


Ruddersbands (fevetnpias tav wndarlwv). Lit., the bands 
of the rudders. The larger ships had two rudders, like broad 
oars or paddles, joined together by a pole, and managed by one 
steersman. They could be pulled up and fastened with bands 
to the ship ; as was done in this case, probably to avoid fouling 
the anchors when they were cast out of the stern. The bands 
were now loosened, in order that the ship might be driven for- 
ward. 


Mainsail (a4ptéuwva). Only here in New Testament. Prob- 
ably the foresail. So Rev. 


Made toward (xaretyov). Lit., held ; bore down for. 


Cx. XXVIUIL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 597 


CHAPTER XXVIII. 


1. They knew. The best texts read we knew: ascertained 
or recognized: with a reference to ver. 39. 


9. Barbarous people. From the Roman point of view, re- 
garding all as barbarians who spoke neither Greek nor Latin. 
Not necessarily uncivilized. It is equivalent to foreigners. 
Compare Rom. i. 14; 1 Cor. xiv. 11. The inhabitants of Malta 
were of Carthaginian descent. ‘Even in the present day the 
natives of Malta have a peculiar language, termed the Maltese, 
which has been proved to be essentially an Arabic dialect, with 
an admixture of Italian ” (Gloag). 


No little (od tuxodcav). See on special, ch. xix. 11. Rev., 
much better, “no common kindness.” 


Kindness (dirav9pwriav). See on the kindred adverb 
courteously, ch. xxvii. 3. 


Present rain (derdv Tov épeotarta). Lit., which was upon us, 
or had set in. No mention of rain occurs up to this point in 
the narrative of the shipwreck. The tempest may thus far 
have been unattended with rain, but it ishardly probable. 


3. Of sticks (dpvydvev). Only here in New Testament. 
From ¢piya, to roast or parch. Hence, dry sticks. 


Out of (ex). The best texts read a7d, by reason of. 
4. Justice (Aikn). Personified. 


Suffereth not (ov clacev). The aorist tense: did not suffer. 
His death is regarded as fixed by the divine decree. 


5. The beast (70 Snplov). Luke uses the word in the same 
way as the medical writers, who employed it to denote venom- 


598 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XXVIIL 


ous serpents, and particularly the viper; so much so that an 
antidote, made chiefly from the flesh of vipers, was termed 
Inptaxy. A curious bit of etymological history attaches to this 
latter word. From it came the Latin theriaca, of which our 
treacle (molasses) is a corruption. Treacle, therefore, is origi- 
nally a preparation of viper’s flesh, and was used later of any 
antidote. Thus Coverdale’s translation of Jer. viii. 22 has, 
“There is no more ¢reacle in Gilead.” Gurnall (“ Christian in 
Complete Armor”) says: “The saints’ experiences help them 
to a sovereign ¢reacle made of the scorpion’s own flesh (which 
they through Christ have slain), and that hath a virtue above 
all other to expel the venom of Satan’s temptations from the 
heart.” So Jeremy Taylor: “We kill the viper and make 
treacle of him.” 


6. Swollen (aiumpacSar). Only here in New Testament. 
The usual medical word for inflammation. 


Looked (zpocdoxavtwy). Occurring eleven times in Luke, 
and only five times in the rest of the New Testament. Fre- 
quent in medical writers, to denote expectation of the fatal re- 
sult of illness. 


No harm (udev aromov). Lit., nothing out of place. The 
word ato7ros occurs three times in Luke, and only once elsewhere 
in the New Testament (2 Thess. iii. 2). Used by physicians to 
denote something wnuswal in the symptoms of disease, and also 
something fatal or deadly as here. Rev., nothing amiss. Com- 
pare Luke xxiii. 41; and Acts xxv.5, where the best texts in- 
sert the word. 


Said (€eyov). The imperfect, denoting current talk. 
A god. “Observe,” says Bengel, “the fickleness of human 
reasoning. He is either an assassin, say they, or a god. So, 


at one time dulls, at another stones” (Acts xiv. 18, 19). 


7. The chief man (74 rpdre). Official title, without refer- 


Cu. XXVIIL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 599 


ence to his rank and possessions. Though not occurring as the 
official designation of the governor of Malta in any ancient 
author, it has been found in two inscriptions discovered in the 
island. 


8. Sick (cuvexydpuevov). Lit., taken or holden. See on taken, 
Luke iv. 38. 


Fever (zuperois). Lit., fevers. This peculiarly medical use 
of the plural is confined to Luke in the New Testament. It de- 
notes successive and varying attacks of fever. 


Bloody fiux (évcevrepia). Only here in New Testament. 
Our word dysentery is nearly a transcript of it. Hippocrates 
often speaks of the two complaints in combination. 


Healed (iacaro). See on Luke vi. 19. 


10. Honors (tiais). The word was applied to payments 
for professional services, and that fact may have influenced Luke 
in selecting it ; but it is evidently not used in that sense here. 


11. Sign. Answering to the ship’s name in modern times. 
It was the image of a god, a man, a beast, or of some other 
object, sculptured or painted on the prow. The figure of the 
guardian deity was affixed to the stern. 


Castor and Pollux. Known as the twin brothers and the 
Dioscuri, or sons of Jove. They were regarded as tutelary 
deities of sailors. 


16. The centurion delivered the prisoners to the cap=- 
tain of the guard. The best texts omit. 


20. | am bound (repixesuas). Lit., compassed. 


92. We desire (a&odpev). Rather, we think a fitting. 
Compare ch. xv. 38. 


Sect. See on heresies, 2 Pet. ii. 1. 


600 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XXVIIL 


25. Agreed not. See on agreed together, ch. v. 9. 
27. Waxed gross. See on Matt. xiii. 15. 


Their ears are dull of hearing. Lit., with their ears they 
heard heavily. 


Closed. See on Matt. xiii. 15. 


30. Hired house (uioSepartt). Probably different from the 
Eevia, or lodging-place, where he resided for the first few days, 
perhaps as the guest of friends, though under custody, and 
where he received the Jews (ver. 23).

INTRODUCTION TO THE EPISTLES OF 
JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE. 





Tur name “catholic” is applied to the epistle of James, the 
two epistles of Peter, the three of John, and the epistle of 
Jude. The term is variously explained, some regarding it as 
equivalent to canonical, others as opposed to heretical, and as 
applied to writings which agree with the doctrines of the uni- 
versal church. Others, again, suppose that this group of epistles 
was so designated, in order to distinguish it from the two other 
groups formed by the Gospels and Acts, and the Pauline epis- 
tles, as a general collection of the writings of other apostles. 

The better explanation is that they are called “catholic,” or 
general, because addressed to no particular church or individual, 
but to a number of scattered churches or people (see 1 Pet. i. 1, 
and James i. 1). In this sense the term does not strictly apply 
to the second and third epistles of John, which are addressed 
to individuals, and includes them only when regarded in the 
light of appendices to the first epistle. We speak in this Intro- 
duction of the epistles of James, Peter, and Jude only, reserving 
remarks on the epistles of John for the general introduction 
to the Johannine writings, in the second volume. 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES. 


According to the oldest arrangement of the New Testament, 
the epistle of James stands first in order of all the apostolical 
epistles. The most competent critics generally agree in desig- 


616 INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE. 


nating as its author James, the president of the church at 
Jerusalem, and known as the Lord’s brother. 

“No doubt,” says Dean Stanley, “if we look at James’ in- 
fluence and authority from the more general point of view, 
whether of the whole Jewish Christian world or of the whole 
Gentile Christian world, it sinks into nothing before the majesty 
of Peter and Paul;” but within the circle of the purely Pales- 
tinian Christians, and in Jerusalem, James is the chief repre- 
sentative of the Christian society. The later traditions of the 
Jewish Christians invest him with a priestly sanctity. His 
austerities and devotions are described in extravagant terms. 
He is said to have kneeled until his knees were as hard as the 
knees of camels, and to have been constant in prayer in the 
temple. He went barefoot, and practised abstinence from wine, 
and wore the long hair, the linen ephod, and the unshorn beard 
of the Nazarites, and even abstained from washing. He was 
known as ‘The Just.” The people vied with each other to 
touch the hem of his garment; and he is reputed to have called 
down rain in the drought, after the manner of Elijah. THis 
chair was preserved as a relic until the fourth century, and a pil- 
lar in the valley of Jehoshaphat marked the spot where he fell. 

The account of his martyrdom is given by Eusebius from the 
lost work of Hegesippus, by Josephus, and in the Clementine 
Recognitions. In Hegesippus and the Recognitions, the story 
is dramatic and deeply tinged with romance. The narrative 
of the former “is,” says Dr. Schaff, “an overdrawn picture 
of the middle of the second century, colored by Judaizing 
traits, which may have been derived from ‘the Ascents of 
James’ and other apocryphal sources.” It is, substantially, as 
follows: Having been asked, “ What is the gate of Jesus?” 
he replied that he was the Saviour; from which some be- 
lieved that Jesus is the Christ. The Jews and Scribes and 
Pharisees, becoming alarmed, came to James, and besought him 
to restrain the people from going after Jesus, to persuade 
against him all that came to the Passover, and, with this view, 
to stand on the pinnacle of the temple, where he might be seen 
and heard by all the people. They accordingly placed him 
there, and said, “O Just One, to whom we all give heed, inas- 


INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE. 617 


much as the people is gone astray after Jesus who is crucified, 
tell us what is the gate of Jesus?” He answered, with a loud 
voice, “Why ask ye me concerning Jesus, the Son of man ? 
He sits in heaven, on the right hand of the mighty power, and 
he is also about to come in the clouds of heaven.” Many being 
convinced, and saying, “ Hosanna to the Son of David!” the 
Scribes and Pharisees said, “ We have done ill in furnishing so 
great a testimony to Jesus. Let us go and cast him down.” 
They went up then and threw him down, and as he was not 
killed by the fall they began to stone him. And he, turning 
round, knelt and said, “I beseech thee, Lord God and Father, 
forgive them, for they know not what they do.” But while 
they were thus stoning him, one of the priests, of the sons of 
Rechab, cried, saying, “Stop! whatdoye? The Just One prays 
for you;” and one of them, one of the fullers, took the club 
with which he used to press the cloths, and struck it on the 
head of the Just One. And so he bore witness, and they buried 
him on the place by the temple. 

The epistle was probably written from Jerusalem, where 
James would be likely to become acquainted with the condition 
of the Jews, through those who came up at the feasts. Certain 
allusions in the epistle go to confirm this. The comparison of 
the double-minded man to a wave of the sea (i. 6), and the pict- 
ure of the ships (iii. 4), might well be written by one dwelling 
near the sea and familiar with it. The illustrations in. i. 11; 
12—the figs, the oil, the wine, the salt and bitter springs—are 
furnished by Palestine, as are the drought (v. 17, 18), the 
former and the latter rain (v. 7), and the hot, parching wind 
(i. 11), for which the name xavowv was specially known in 
Palestine. 

The epistle is written from a Jewish stand-point. “ Chris- 
tianity appears in it, not as a new dispensation, but as a develop- 
ment and perfection of the old. The Christian’s highest honor 
is not that he is a member of the universal church, but that he 
is the genuine type of the ancient Israelite. It reveals no new 
principle of spiritual life, such as those which were to turn the 
world upside down in the teaching of Paul or of John, but only 
that pure and perfect morality which was the true fulfilment of 


618 INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE. 


the law” (Stanley). Twice only the name of Christ occurs (i. 
1; ii. 1); the word “gospel” not at all; and there isno allusion 
to Redemption, Incarnation, Resurrection, or Ascension. The 
rules of morality which he lays down are enforced by Jewish 
rather than by Christian motives and sanctions. The violation 
of the “royal law” is menaced with the sentence of the law 
(ii. 8, 18); and uncharitable judgment is deprecated on the 
ground of the law’s condemnation, and not as alien to the spirit 
of Christ. 

At the same time, the very legalism of the epistle is the out- 
growth of the Sermon on the Mount, the language of which it 
reflects more than any other book of the New Testament. It 
meets the formalism, the fatalism, the hypocrisy, the arrogance, 
insolence, and oppression engendered by the sharp social dis- 
tinctions of the age, with a teaching conceived in the spirit, and 
often expressed in the forms of the Great Teacher’s moral code. 
“The epistle,” says Dr. Scott, “strikes the ear from beginning 
to end as an echo of the oral teaching of our Lord. There is 
scarcely a thought in it which cannot be traced to Christ’s per- 
sonal teaching. If John has lain on the Saviour’s bosom, James 
has sat at his feet.”

The style and diction of the epistle are strongly marked. 
Links connecting them with the historic individuality of the 
writer, which are so numerous in the case of Peter, are almost 
entirely wanting. The expression, ‘“ Hearken, my beloved 
brethren ” (ii. 5), suggests the similar phrase, Acts xv. 13; and 
the ordinary Greek greeting, yalpew, hail (Acts xv. 23), is re- 
peated in Jas. i. 1; the only two places where it occurs in a 
Christian epistle. The purity of the Greek, and its comparative 
freedom from Hebraisms, are difficult to account for in a writer 
who had passed his life in Jerusalem. The style is sententious 
and antithetic; the thoughts not linked in logical connection, 
but massed in groups of short sentences, like the proverbial say- 
ings of the Jews; with which class of literature the writer was 
evidently familiar. His utterance glows with the fervor of his 
spirit; it is rapid, exclamatory, graphic, abrupt, sometimes 
poetical in form, and moving with a rhythmical cadence. “ It 
combines pure and eloquent and rhythmical Greek with He. 
brew intensity of expression.” 


THE EPISTLES OF PETER. 


The life and character of the apostle Peter are familiar to all 
readers of the Gospels and Acts. It has already been shown 
in the Introduction to the Gospel of Mark how the style and 
diction of that gospel exhibit the influence of Peter, and how 
the characteristics which appear in the Acts, in those scenes in 
which Peter was the only or the principal actor, reappear in the 
second gospel. If these epistles are from his pen, we may 
therefore expect to find in them traces of the keen-sightedness, 
the ready application of what is observed, and the impulsiveness 


620 INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE. 


and promptness which appear in the other two books, always 
allowing for the difference between a narrative and a hortatory 
style. 

It has been observed that “the sight, and what it should do 
and reap, fills a great space in Peter’s letters.” Accordingly, 
we read that God’s salvation is ready to be revealed in the last 
time (1, i. 5); the angels desire to look into the mysteries of 
the gospel (1, i. 12); Christ was manifested at the end of the 
times (1, i. 20); the Gentiles shall behold your good works 
(1, ii. 12); unbelieving husbands shall be convinced by behold- 
ing the chaste behavior of their wives (1, iii. 2); the apostle 
was a witness of Christ’s sufferings (1, v. 1), and an eye-witness 
of his majesty (2, i. 16); the elders must exercise oversight of 
the flock (1, v. 2). Similarly he speaks of the day of wzsza- 
tion, or, lit., overlooking (1, ii. 12); Christ is the beshop, lit., 
overseer, of souls (1, ii. 25); he who lacks Christian graces 
is blind, seeing only what is near (2, i. 9); Lot was vexed at 
seemng the wickedness of his neighbors (2, ii. 8); the wicked 
have eyes full of adultery (2, ii. 14). 

Equally apparent is his readiness to apply what he sees and 
hears. ‘Not one thought,” says Canon Cook, “ connected with 
the mystery of salvation is presented without an instant and 
emphatic reference to what a Christian ought to feel, and what 
he ought to do. No place in the spiritual temple is so humble 
that he who holds it has not before him the loftiest sphere 
of spiritual action and thought. Injunctions which touch the 
heart most powerfully are impressed upon us as we contemplate 
the eternal glory, the manifestations of Christ’s love.’ Thus 
we have sanctification of the spirit wnto obedience (1, i. 2); be 
holy in deweng (1,1. 15). The first epistle abounds in exhorta- 
tions to personal religion (ii. 10-18 5 iii. 1-16; iv. 1-11 ; v. 1-9). 
Christian graces shall make believers to be neither zd@le nor wn- 
Sruitful (2, i. 8); they shall not fall if they do these things 
(2, 1. 10); he exhorts to holy dwg and godliness (2, iii. T1). z 

It is in such pointed and practical exhortations as these that 
the prompt and energetic character of the apostle reappears. 
Dr. Davidson observes that the writer is “zealous, but mild, 
earnest, but not fervid;” a statement which is adapted to pro- 


INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE. 621 


voke a smile from one who has felt the nervous grip of the first 
epistle, and which becomes palpably absurd if we admit, as of 
course Dr. Davidson does not, the authenticity of the second. 
The “mild tone” assuredly is not dominant there; but, in any 
event, it would be strange if the letters did not show traces of 
the mellowing of years, and of the ripening of the spirit of 
Christ in this once passionate and headstrong disciple. The 
second chapter of the second epistle is no feeble reminder of the 
Peter who smote off the ear of Malchus. 

The graphic and picturesque character of these letters is nota- 
ble. In the two epistles, containing eight chapters, the longest 
of which consists of but twenty-five verses, there are one hun- 
dred and nineteen words which occur nowhere else in the New 
Testament. Picture-words abound, such as @pudpevos, roaring 
(1, v. 8); drdlcacSe, arm yourselves (1, iv. 1); émuxadvppa, 
cloke (1, ii. 16); dysotv, put to silence, lit., muzzle (1, ii. 15); 
oxor.s, froward, lit., awry or twisted (1, ii. 18); exrevdis, Ser- 
vently, lit., on the stretch (1, i. 22); dmdtecis, putting off (2, i. 
14); é£o80s, decease (2, i. 15); Stavydfew, dawn (QALeieys 
aiyynpos, dark or dry (2, i. 19); eidvors, interpretation, lit., 
untying (2, i. 20); otpeBrodow, wrest, as with a windlass (2, 
ili, 16), and many others. 

The same graphic character appears in what may be styled 
reminiscent words or phrases, in which the former personal ex- 
perience of the writer is mirrored. Thus, gird yourselves with 
humility (1, v.5, see note there) recalls the picture of the Lord 
girded with a towel and washing the disciples’ feet. Zo look 
into (1, i. 12) expresses a stooping down to gaze intently, and 
carries us back to the visit of Peter and John to the sepulchre 
on the morning of the resurrection, when they stooped down 
and looked into the tomb. In feed the flock (Rev., zend, 1, v. 2) 
is reflected Christ’s charge to Peter at the lake. The recurrence 
of the word dpocwromjprras, without respect of persons (1, i. 
17), used in a kindred form by Peter, Acts x. 34, would seem to 
indicate that the scene in the house of Cornelius was present to 
his mind ; and be watchful (1, v. 8) may have been suggested by 
the remembrance of his own drowsiness in Gethsemane, and of 
Christ’s exhortation to watch. So, too, it is interesting to read 


622 INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE. 


the words buffeted (A, ii. 20), the tree (ro EvAov, an unusual word, 
used by him, Acts v. 30; x. 39), and stripe or weal (1, il. 24), in 
the light of the gospel narratives of Christ’s sufferings. Christ 
had called Simon @ rock, and a little later a stwmbling-block. 
Peter combines both words into one phrase, a rock of offence 
(1, ii. 8). A very striking instance appears in the reference to 
the Transfiguration (2, i. 17, 18), where he uses the peculiar 
word é£060s, decease ; lit., going out, which occurs in Luke ix. 
31, and also in Heb. xi. 22. Compare, also, tabernacle, in 2,.1. 
13, 14, with let ws make three tabernacles. 

Both epistles are pervaded with an Old-Testament atmos- 
phere. The testimony of Old-Testament prophecy, teaching, 
and history is emphasized (1, i. 10-12; iii. 5, 6, 20; 2, 1. 19- 
21; ii. 1, 4-8, 15, 16; iii. 2, 5, 6). Old-Testament quotations 
and references are brought into the text, though the intro- 
ductory formulas, because it ts written, and wherefore it is con- 
tained in scripture, do not occur in the second epistle; and the 
interweaving, as of familiar expressions, is not so conspicuous 
there as in the first. epistle (see 1, i. 16, 24, 25; ii. 6, 7, 9, 10, 
23,124,010; 6,, 1014: eiy. 8) 18% ty 259 (342, .15 19-21 ser ba; 
7, 15, 21; iii. 5, 6, 8, 13). The church of Christ is repre- 
sented as the church of Israel perfected and spiritualized (1, ii. 
4-10); the exhortation to holiness (1, i. 15, 16) is given in the 
language of Lev. xi. 44; Christ is described (1, ii. 6) in the 
terms of Isaiah xxviii. 16, and Ps. exviii. 22; and the prophetic 
utterance of Isaiah concerning the servant of Jehovah (lii. 13- 
lili. 12) reappears in 1, ii. 28, 24. 

The epistles are evidently the work of a Jew. We find, as 
we might expect, the writer illustrating his positions from Jew- 
ish history and tradition, as in his references to Noah, Sarah, 
Balaam, and his use of the word pavticpos, sprinkling (A, i. 2), 
a peculiarly Levitical term. He shows how the spirit of Christ 
dwelt in the Old-Testament prophets, and how Christians are a 
royal priesthood. 

The resemblance, both in ideas and expressions, to pas- 
sages in the epistles of Paul and James is marked, especially 
in the first epistle. It will be instructive to compare the fol- 
lowing :

Nor are such resemblances wanting in the second epistle, 
though they are resemblances in tone, subject, and spirit, rather 
than verbal. It is in this epistle that Peter designates Paul’s 
writings as scripture (ili. 16). Compare

Into the much-vexed question of the authenticity of the sec- 
ond epistle we are not called upon to enter. The point of dif- 
ferences of style between the two epistles is a fair one. There 


624 INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE. 


are such differences, and very decided ones, though perhaps 
they are no more and no greater than can be explained by 
diversity of subject and circumstances, and the difference in the 
author’s age. Some of the expressions peculiar to the second 
epistle are—granting things which pertain unto life and godli- 
ness (i. 8); precious and exceeding great (i. 4) ; adding all dili- 
gence, and supply virtue (i. 5); an entrance richly supplied 
(i. 11); receiving forgetfulness (i. 9) ; sects of perdition (ii. 1) 5 
cast down to Tartarus (ii.4); the world compacted out of water 
and by means of water (iii. 5), ete. 

But, while allowing for these differences, and recognizing the 
weakness of the external evidence for the authenticity of the 
epistle, the internal evidence of style and tone seems to us to 
outweigh the differences, and to show that both epistles were 
from the same hand. There is the same picturesqueness of 
diction, and a similar fertility of unusual words. Of the one 
hundred and twenty words which occur only in the writings 
of Peter, fifty-seven are peculiar to the second epistle; and, 
what is still more noteworthy, only one of these words, azrodeats, 
putting off, is common to the two epistles—a fact which tells 
very strongly against the hypothesis of a forgery. That hypoth- 
esis, it may be observed, is in the highest degree improbable. 
The Christian earnestness, the protest against deception, the 
tender and adoring reminiscence of Christ, the emphasis upon 
the person and doctrine of the Lord Jesus which mark this 
epistle, imply a moral standard quite inconsistent with the per- 
petration of a deliberate forgery. 

Comparisons of expressions in this epistle with those used or 
inspired by Peter in the Acts of the Apostles exhibit a close 
correspondence ; and a correspondence, which, however, must 
not be too strongly pressed, appears on a comparison with cer- 
tain passages in the gospels. Thus the verb dwpéopas, to give, 
occurs only in Mark xv. 45, and 2 Pet. i. 3, 4 (see Introduction 
to Mark, on the relations between Mark and Peter); and the 
recurrence of the words exodus, or decease, and tabernacle in 
the same connection (2 Pet. i. 138-15, 17, 18) is very striking 
from the pen of one who, at the Transfiguration, heard the 
heavenly visitants conversing of Christ’s decease, and who pro 


INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE. 625 


posed to build ¢abernacles for their abode. The repeated use 
of the word ornpite, stablish, and its derivatives (i. 12; ili. 
17; ii. 14; iii. 16) is also suggestive, in view of the admonition 
of Jesus to Peter by the same word—strengthen thy brethren 
(Luke xxii. 32). 

There is the same retrospective character in both epistles. 
In both the writer teaches that prophecy does not carry its own 
interpretation ; in both he alludes to the small number saved 
from the flood; both have the same sentiments on the nature 
and right use of Christian liberty, and on the value of prophecy ; 
in both dper7, virtue, is attributed to God, a use of the word 
occurring nowhere else in the New Testament. 

The style of both epistles is vigorous rather than elegant, 
strong, and sometimes rough, the work of a plain, practical man, 
and of an observer rather than a reasoner, whose thoughts do 
not follow each other in logical sequence. The fervid spirit of 
the writer appears in his habit of massing epithets, and repeating 
his thoughts in nearly the same words and forms (see, for in- 
stance, 1 Pet. 1.4; ii 4,11; 1.19; i1.9. Also, i. 7, and iv. 12; 
i. 13, and iv. 7, v.8; i.14, and ii. 11, iv. 2; ii. 15, and ii. 1,16; 
ii. 19, and iii. 14, iv. 14. 2 Pet. i. 4, 8,17; ii. 10, 11, 12-15; 
iii. 15). Professor Ezra Abbot has brought out some remark- 
able correspondences between this epistle and the writings of 
Josephus, and maintains that the author of the letter is largely 
dependent upon the Jewish historian (Hzpositor, 2d series, iii., 
49). The second epistle of Peter cannot be studied apart from 


THE EPISTLE OF JUDE. 


This brief letter is assigned to the Judas of Matt. xii. 55, 
one of the brethren of Jesus, and of James, the author of the 
catholic epistle. It is a hotly debated question whether Peter’s 
second letter or Jude’s epistle is the earlier, and, consequently, 
which writer drew upon the other. It is quite evident, either 
that the one used the other’s epistle or that both drew from a 
common source. A satisfactory decision is impossible in the 
present state of the evidence. The matter which is common to 

40 


626 INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE. 


the two epistles, besides various scattered resemblances, is prin- 
cipally in Jude 3-18; 2 Pet. 1-5; ii. 1-18 (see Ezra Abbot, 
Expositor, 2d series, ili., 139). 

Besides the resemblance to Second Peter, the epistle is 
marked by its apocryphal references, especially to the Book of 
Enoch (see notes on 9, 14). In style it is terse and picturesque. 
“Tt is Greek as learned by a foreigner, and partly from books, 
and it is mixed up with Hebrew phrases.” It contains at least 
fifteen words not found elsewhere in the New Testament. Dean 
Alford says: “It is an impassioned invective, in which the 
writer heaps epithet on epithet, and image on image, and re- 
turns again and again to the licentious apostates against whom 
he warns the church, as though all language were insufficient to 
give an adequate idea of their profligacy, and of his own abhor- 
rence of their perversion of the grace and doctrines of the 
Gospel.” 


THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 


CHAPTER I. 


1. Peter (Ilérpos). See on Matt. xvi. 18. As Paul in his 
letters does not call himself by his original name of Saul, so 
Peter calls himself, not Simon, but Peter, the name most sig- 
nificant and precious both to himself and to his readers, because 
bestowed by his Lord. In the opening of the second epistle he 
uses both names. 


An apostle. Of all the catholic epistles, Peter’s alone puts 
forward his apostleship in the introduction. He is addressing 
churches with which he had no immediate connection, and which 
were distinctively Pauline. Hence he appeals to his apostle- 
ship in explanation of his writing to them, and as his warrant 
for taking Paul’s place. 


To the strangers—elect (ver. 2, é«AeKrois Taper vonp.0ls). 
The Rev., properly, joins the two words, elect who are sojourners, 
instead of continuing elect with according to the foreknowledge, 
etc., as A. V. 


Elect. Regarding all whom he addressed as subjects of sav- 
ing grace. The term corresponds to the Old-Testament title of 
Jehovah’s people: Isa. Ixv. 9, 15, 22; Ps. cv. 43. Compare 
Matt. xx. 16; xxii. 14; Rom. viii. 33. 


Sojourners (rapemdjpots). Persons sojourning for a brief 
season in a foreign country. Though applied primarily to 


628 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca L 


Hebrews scattered throughout the world (Gen. xxiii. 4; Ps. 
xxxix. 12), it has here a wider, spiritual sense, contemplating 
Christians as having their citizenship in heaven. Compare 
Heb. xi. 13. The preposition mapa, in composition, implies a 
sense of transitoriness, as of one who passes by to something 
beyond. 


Scattered (Sacropas). Lit., of the dispersion » from 6:a- 
omelpw, to scatter or spread abroad ; oreipw meaning, originally, 
to sow. The term was a familiar one for the whole body of 
Jews outside the Holy Land, scattered among the heathen. 


9. According to (cava). In virtue of ; in accordance with. 


Foreknowledge (mpéyvwow). Only here and Acts ii. 23, 
in Peter’s sermon at Pentecost. He is distinguishing there be- 
tween foreknowledge and determinate counsel. 


The Father. Implying that the relation contemplated by 
the divine foreknowledge is a new relation of sonshep. 


In sanctification (é€v dywacwe). Compare 2 Thess. ii. 13. 
The spiritual state a which the being elected to salvation is 
realized. The word is peculiarly Pauline, occurring eight times 
in Paul’s epistles, and besides only here and Heb. xii. 14. 


Unto obedience (eis). Note the three prepositions: accerd- 
ing to (kara) the foreknowledge; im (év) sanctification ; wnto 
(eis) obedience. The ground, sphere, and end of spiritual 
sanctification. 


Sprinkling (pavtecpov). Here in a passive sense—the being 
sprinkled. Properly, the ritualistic act of sprinkling blood or 
water. See Num. xix. 19,21. Compare Heb. ix. 13; xii. 24; 
Num. xix. 9, 18, where the water in which were the ashes of 
the red heifer is called déwp pavticpod, water of sprinkling 
(Septuagint), which the A. V. and Rev. Old Testament ren- 
der water of separation. The word and its kindred verb occur 
only in Hebrews and Peter. 


Cue] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 629 


Jesus Christ. The foreknowledge of the Mather, the sanc- 
tification of the Spirit, the obedience and sprinkling of the 
plood of Jesus Christ the Son. The Father foreknowing, the 
Son atoning, the Spirit applying the Son’s work in sanctifying. 
“The mystery of the Trinity and the economy of our salvation 
are intimated in this verse ” (Bengel). 


Grace and peace (ydpus—eipyvn). Pauline terms. See Rom. 
i. 7. The salutation is peculiar by the addition of be multi- 
plied, which occurs 2 Pet. i. 2; Jude 2, and nowhere else in 
the salutations of the epistles. It is found, however, in the 
Septuagint, Dan. iv. 1 (Sept. iii. 31), and vi. 25. Professor 
Salmond observes: “If the Babylon from which Peter writes 
can be taken to be the literal Babylon (see on v. 18), it might 
be interesting to recall the epistles introduced by salutations so 
similar to Peter’s, which were written from the same capital by 
two kings, Nebuchadnezzar and Darius, of two great dynasties, 
and addressed to all their provinces.” 


3. Blessed (eddoynT0s). €d, well, réyos, a word. Well- 
spoken-of ; praised ; honored. Used in the New Testament 
of God only. The kindred verb is applied to human beings, as 
to Mary (Luke i. 28): “ Blessed (edroynpévn) art thou.” Com- 
pare the different word for blessed in Matt. v. 8, etc. (waxapeor), 
and see notes there. The style of this doxological phrase is 
Pauline. Compare 2 Cor. i. 3; Eph. i. 3. 


Hath begotten us again (avayevjoas fas). The verb is 
used by Peter only, and by him only here and ver. 23. It is 
in the aorist tense, and should be rendered, as Rev., begat ; be- 
cause regeneration is regarded as a definite historical act accom- 
plished once for all, or possibly because Peter regards the his- 
torical act of Christ’s resurrection as virtually effecting the 
regeneration. The latter sentiment would be Pauline, since 
Paul is wont to speak of Christians as dying and rising with 
Christ. Rom. vii. 4; vi. 8-11. 


Lively (facav). Better, as Rev., literally rendering the 


630 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. L 


participle, living: a favorite word with Peter. See i. 23; ii. 
4, 5, 24; iv. 5,6; and compare Acts ix. 41, where Peter is the 
prominent actor; and x. 42, where he is the speaker. 


Hope (€Aida). Peter is fond of this word also (see i. 18, 21; 
iii. 5, 15), which, in classical Greek, has the general signification 
of expectancy, relating to evil as well as to good. Thus Plato 
speaks of living in evel hope (“ Republic,” i., 330); i.e., in the 
apprehension of evil; and Thucydides, of the hope of evils to 
come ; i.e., the expectation or apprehension. In the New Tes- 
tament the word always relates to a future good. 


4. An inheritance (xAnpovoyiav). A Pauline word, from 
KAhpos, & lot, and véyouat, to distribute among themselves. 
Hence an inheritance is originally a portion which one receives 
by lot in a general distribution. In the New Testament the 
idea of chance attaching to the lot is eliminated. It is the 
portion or heritage which one receives by virtue of birth or by 
special gift. So of the vineyard seized by the wicked husband- 
men: “ Let us seize on his inheritance” (Matt. xxi. 38); of 
Abraham in Canaan: “God gave him none ¢nheritance” 
(Acts vii. 5); “an eternal inheritance” (Heb. ix. 15). 


Incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away. 
Note Peter’s characteristic multiplication of epithets. Jncor- 
ruptible (épIaprov). From 4, not, and $Ieipw, to destroy or 
corrupt. Undefiled (aplavrov). From 4, not, and pualve, to 
defile, though the verb means especially to defile by staining, 
as with color ; while podvva, also translated defile (1 Cor. viii. 7), 
is to besmirch, as with mire. We might render unstained, 
though the word is not used with any conscious reference to 
its etymology. That fadeth not away (a4udpavrov). Used by 
Peter only, and but once. From 4, not, and papaivoua, to 
wither. 'The loveliness of the heavenly inheritance is described 
as exempt from the blight which attaches to earthly bloom. 
As between add¢3aprov, wncorruptible, and audpavrov, wnwither- 
wg, the former emphasizes the indestructibility of substance, 
and the latter of grace and beauty. The latter adjective ap- 


Cx. I.] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 631 


pears in the familiar botanical name amaranth. It will be 
observed that all of these three epithets are compounded with 
the negative particle @, not. Archbishop Trench aptly remarks 
that “it is a remarkable testimony to the reign of sin, and 
therefore of imperfection, of decay, of death throughout this 
whole fallen world, that as often as we desire to set forth the 
glory, purity, and perfection of that other, higher world toward 
which we strive, we are almost inevitably compelled to do this 
by the aid of negatives; by the denying to that higher order 
of things the leading features and characteristics of this.” Com- 
pare Apoe. xxi. 1, 4, 22, 23, 275; xxii. 3, 5. 


Reserved (rernpnuévnv). Lit., which has been reserved, a 
perfect participle, indicating the inheritance as one reserved 
through God’s care for his own from the beginning down to 
the present. Zaid up and kept is the idea. The verb signi- 
fies keeping as the result of guarding. Thus in John xvii. 11, 
Christ says, “ keep (tApnoov) those whom thou hast given me ;” 
in ver. 12, “I keptthem” (érypovr) ; ¢.¢., preserved by guarding 
them. “Those whom thou gavest me I guarded (épvdaka).” 
So Rev., which preserves the distinction. Similarly, John 
xiv. 15, “keep (rnpjoate) my commandments ;” preserve them 
unbroken by careful watching. So Peter was delivered to the 
soldiers to guard him (fvAdocew), but he was kept (érypetro) 
in prison (Acts xii. 4, 51). Compare Col. i. 5, where a different 
word is used: dzroxeypevny, lit., laid away. 


For you (eis). The use of this preposition, instead of the 
simpler dative, is graphic: with reference to you; with you as 
its direct object. 


5. Kept (dpovpovpévous). A military term. Lit., garresoned. 
Rev., guarded. Compare 2 Cor. xi. 32, and the beautiful met- 
aphorical use of the word at Philip. iv. 7, “ shall guard your 
hearts.” The present participle indicates something m progress, 
a continuous process of protection. Hence, lit., who are being 
guarded. “The inheritance is kept ; the heirs are guarded” 
(Bengel). 


632 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. L 


By (év) the power; through (8a) faith ; unto (es) salva- 
tion. By, indicating the efficient cause; through, the second- 
ary agency; unto, the result. 


Salvation. Note the frequent occurrence of this word, vv. 
9, 10. 


Ready (éroéunv). Stronger than about to be, or destened to 
be, implying a state of waiting or preparedness, and thus har- 
monizing with reserved. 


6. Ve greatly rejoice (ayak\dade). The word is always 
employed in the New Testament for great or lively joy. See 
Matt. v.12; Luke i. 47; x. 21. 


For a season (oAtyov). More literally and correctly, as Rev., 
Jor a little while. Compare ch. v.10. The word is used no- 
where else in the New Testament in this sense. 


In heaviness (AvrnJévtes). Lit., having been grieved. Rev., 
ye have been put to grief. 


Through (év). But Rev., better, a; the preposition not 
being instrumental, but indicating the sphere or environment in 
which the grief operates. 


Manifold (zrov«éAous). Literally the word means variegated. 
It is used to describe the skin of a leopard, the different-colored 
veinings of marble, or an embroidered robe; and thence passes 
into the meaning of changeful, diversified, applied to the 
changing months or the variations of a strain of music. Peter 
employs it again, ch. iv. 10, of the grace of God, and James of 
temptations, as here (i. 2). Compare odvzoixidos, manifold, 
in Eph. iii. 10, applied to the wisdom of God. The word gives 
a vivid picture of the dwersity of the trials, emphasizing this 
idea rather than that of their nwmber, which is left to be in- 
ferred. 


Temptations (ecpacwois). Better, trials, as in margin of 


Cx. 1] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 633 


Reyv., since the word includes more than direct solicitation to 
evil. It embraces all that goes to furnish a ¢es¢ of character. 
Compare Jas. i. 2. 


7. Trial (Soxiucov). Only here and Jas. i. 3. Rev., proof. 
The word means a ¢est. As the means of proof, however, is 
not only the touchstone itself, but the trace of the metal left 
upon it, the sense here is the reswlt of the contact of faith with 
trial, and hence the verification of faith. The expression is 
equivalent to your approved faith. Compare Rom. ii. 7, 10. 


Than of gold. Omitthe of, and read than gold. The com- 
parison is between the approved faith and the gold; not be- 
tween the faith and the proof of the gold. 


Though it be tried (Sox¢wafopuévov). Kindred with doxiwsop, 
proof, and better rendered by Rev., proved. The verb is used 
in classical Greek of assaying or testing metals, and means, 
generally, to approve or sanction upon test. It is radically akin 
to déyeoSau, to receive, and hence implies a proof with a view to 
determine whether a thing be worthy to be received. Compare 
1 Cor. iii. 138; Gal. vi. 4; 1 Johniv.1. It thus differs from 
mevpatewv, to try or tempt (see on Tespacpots, ver. 6), in that 
that verb indicates simply a putting to proof to discover what 
good or evil is ina person ; and from the fact that such scrutiny 
so often develops the existence and energy of evil, the word 
acquired a predominant sense of putting to the proof with the 
design or hope of breaking down the subject under the proof— 
in other words, of temptation in the ordinary sense. Hence 
Satan is called 6 qetpdtwv, the tempter, Matt. iv. 3; 1 Thess. 
iii. 5. See on Matt. vi. 18. Archbishop Trench observes that 
“ Soxiyudtew could not be used of Satan, since he never proves 
that he may approve, nor tests that he may accept.” 


Might be found (eipe9#). In accord with the preceding 
expressions, and indicating discovery as the result of scrutiny. 


Praise and glory and honor. Such is the order of the 
best texts, and so Rev. Glory and honor often occur together 


634 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. L, 


in the New Testament, as Rom. ii. 7,10; 1 Tim.i.17. Only 
here with praise. Compare spirit of glory, ch. iv. 14. 


8. Full of glory (Sedofacpévn). Lit., glorified, as Rev., in 
margin. 


Receiving («oysfouevor). The verb originally means ¢o take 
care of or provide for; thence to receive hospitably or enter- 
tain ; to bring home with a view to entertaining or taking care 
of. Hence, to carry away so as to preserve, to save, rescue, and 
so to carry away as a prize or booty. Generally, to recewve or 
acquire. Paul uses it of receiving the awards of judgment 
(2 Cor. v. 10; Eph. vi. 8; Col. iii. 25). In Hebrews it is used 
of receiving the promise (x. 36; xi. 39), and of Abraham re- 
ceiving back Isaac (xi. 19). Peter uses it thrice, and in each 
case of receiving the rewards of righteousness or of iniquity. 
See ch. v. 4; 2 Pet. ii. 13. 


10. Have inquired and searched diligently (é&e€jrycav— 
éEnpedvncav). Rev., properly, renders the aorists sought and 
searched diligently. The é& in composition has the force of 
out, searched out, and is rendered by deligently. 


Sought. Used of Esau’s seeking carefully for a place of 
repentance, in Heb. xii. 17. 


Searched. Used nowhere else in the New Testament. Com- 
pare Septuagint, 1 Sam. xxiii. 23, of Saul’s searching out David. 


11. Did signify (€67\0v). Imperfect tense: better, was de- 
claring, all along through the prophetic age, in successive 
prophets. See the same verb in 1 Cor. iii. 13; 2 Pet. i. 14. 


When it testified beforehand (apouaprupoyevov). Only 
here in New Testament. 


Of Christ (eis Xpiotov). Lit., wnto Christ. So Rev., in 
margin. The sufferings destened for Christ, as in ver. 10 he 


Cu. LJ] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 635 


speaks of the grace, eis tuds, unto you ; i.e., destined to come 
unto you. Peter was especially concerned to show that the 
sufferings of Christ were in fulfilment of prophecy, because it 
was a subject of dispute with the Jews whether the Christ was 
to suffer (Acts ili. 18 ; xxvi. 22, 23). 


The glory (ras d0£as). Rev., correctly, the glories. The 
plural is used to indicate the successive steps of his glorifica- 
tion ; the glory of his resurrection and ascension, of the last 
judgment, and of the kingdom of heaven. 


12. Did minister (Sujxovovv). Imperfect tense, were menis- 
tering. See on Mark ix. 35. The term is applicable to any 
kind of service, official or not. Compare 2 Cor. iii. 3. 


Desire (émuIupodow). The word commonly denotes intense 
desire. It is used by Christ in expressing his wish to eat the 
passover (Luke xxii. 15); of the prodigal’s desire to satisfy his 
hunger with the husks (Luke xv. 16); and of the flesh lusting 
against the spirit (Gal. v. 17). 


To look into (apaxinyar). A very graphic word, meaning 
to stoop sideways (rapa). Used by Aristophanes to picture the 
attitude of a bad harp-player. Here it portrays one stooping 
and stretching the neck to gaze on some wonderful sight. It 
occurs in Jas. i. 25, describing him who looks into the per- 
fect law of liberty as into a mirror; and in Luke xxiv. 12; 
John xx. 5, 11, of Peter and John and Mary stooping and look- 
ing into the empty tomb. Possibly the memory of this inci- 
dent unconsciously suggested the word to Peter. The phrase 
illustrates Peter’s habitual emphasis upon the testimony of 
sight (see Introduction). Bengel acutely notes the hint in wrapa, 
beside, that the angels contemplate the work of salvation from 
without, as spectators and not as participants. Compare Heb. 
ii. 16; Eph. iii. 10. 


13. Gird up (avafwodpevor). Lit., having girded up. Used 
here only. The metaphor is suggested by the girding up of 


636 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. I. 


the loose eastern robes preparatory to running or other exertion. 
Perhaps recalling the words of Christ, Luke xii. 35. Christ’s 
call is a call to active service. There is a fitness in the figure 
as addressed to sojowrners and pilgrims (ch. i. 13 ii. 11), who 
must be always ready to move. 


Mind (8:avolas). See on Mark xii. 30. 


Be sober (vijovres). Lit., being sober. Primarily, in a phys- 
ical sense, as opposed to excess in drink, but passing into the 
general sense of self-control and equanimity. 


Hope to the end (rerclws édmicate). Better, as Rev., set 
your hope perfectly: wholly and unchangeably ; without doubt 
or despondency. 


That is to be brought (Tv depopévnv). Lit., which is being 
brought, as Rev., in margin. The object of hope is already on 
the way. 


14. Obedient children (réxva b7raxonjs). Literally, and more 
correctly, as Rev., children of obedience. See on Mark iii. 17. 
The Christian is represented as related to the motive principle 
of his life as a child to a parent. 


Fashioning yourselves (cvcynparifouevor). See on Matt. 
xvii. 2; and compare Rom. xii. 2, the only other passage where 
the word occurs. As oyfya is the outward, changeable fashion, 
as contrasted with what is zntrinsic, the word really carries a 
warning against conformity to something changeful, and there- 
fore illusory. 


15. As he which hath called you is holy («ata tov xaré- 
cavta buds dyiov). As of the A. V. is according to, or after the 
pattern of ; and holy is to be taken as a personal name; the which 
hath called being added for definition, and in order to strengthen 
the exhortation. Render, therefore, after the pattern of the 
Holy One who called you. So, nearly, Rev.,in margin. A sim- 
ilar construction occurs 2 Pet. ii. 1: the Lord that bought them. 


Cu. LJ THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 637 


Conversation (avactpody). A favorite word with Peter ; 
used eight times in the two epistles. Fromdvd, wp, and otpéda, 
to turn. The process of development in the meaning of the 
word is interesting. 1. A turning upside down. 2. A turning 
about or wheeling. 3. Turning about in a place, going back 
and forth there about one’s business; and so, 4, one’s mode of 
life or conduct. This is precisely the idea in the word conversa- 
tion (Lat., conversare, to turn round) which was used when the 
A. V. was made, as the common term for general deportment or 
behavior, and was, therefore, a correct rendering of dvactpody. 
So Latimer (“Sermons”): “ We are not bound to follow the 
conversations or doings of the saints”? And Shakspeare, 2 
Hen: [V5 v3, 55 


“‘ But all are banished till their conversation 
Appear more wise and modest to the world.” 


Our later limitation of the meaning to the interchange of talk 
makes it expedient to change the rendering, as Rev., to manner 
of living. 


17. If ye call on the Father—judgeth. More correctly, 
Rev., Jf ye call on him as Father ; the point being that God is 
to be invoked, not only as Father, but as Judge. 


Without respect of persons (dampocwmoAjpmtas). Here 
only. Peter, however, uses rpocwmodnpmrns, a respecter of 
persons, Acts x. 84, which whole passage should be compared 
with this. Paul and James also use the kindred word zrpo- 
cwtroAnpria, respect of persons. See Rom. ii. 11; Jas. ii. 1. 
James has the verb rpocwmodnpTréw, to have respect of persons. 
The constituents of the compound word, mpdcwrrov, the counte- 
nance, and AapBdve, to receive, are found in Gal. ii. 6; and the 
word is the Old-Testament formula to accept or to raise the face 
of another; opposed to making the countenance fall (Job xxix. 
24; Gen. iv. 5). Hence, to receive kindly, or look favorably 
upon one (Gen. xix. 21; xxxii. 20, etc.). In the Old Testament 
it is, as Bishop Lightfoot observes, “(a neutral expression in- 


638 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. L 


volving no subsidiary notion of partiality, and is much oftener 
found in a good than in a bad sense. When it becomes an in- 
dependent Greek phrase, however, the bad sense attaches to it, 
owing to the secondary meaning of rpécwmov, a mask ; so that 
mpocwrrov ANauBavew signifies to regard the external circwm- 
stances of a man, his rank, wealth, etc., as opposed to his real, 
intrinsic character.” 


Sojourning (mapocxias). Compare sojourners, ver. 1. 


18. Ye were redeemed (édutp@Inte). The verb occurs 
only in two other passages, Luke xxiv. 21; Tit. ii. 14. It car- 
ries the idea of a ransom-préce (AUTpov, from Ava, to loose). 


With silver or gold (apyupiw } ypvotm). Lit., with silver or 
gold money ; the words meaning, respectively, a small coin of 
silver or of gold. 


Conversation. Rev., manner of life. See on ver. 15. 


Received by tradition from your fathers (aatpomapa- 
détov). A clumsy translation ; improved by Rev., handed down 
From your fathers. 'The word is peculiar to Peter. 


19. But with the precious blood of Christ. The word 
Xpiorod, of Christ, stands at the end of the sentence, and is em- 
phatic. Render, as Rev., wth precious blood as of a lamb, etc., 
even the blood of Christ. 


Lamb. Peculiarly appropriate from Peter. See John i. 
35-42. The reference is to a sacrificial lamb. 


Without blemish (azepov). Representing the Old-Testa- 
ment phrase for absence of physical defect (Exod. xii. 5; 
Lev. xxii. 20. Compare Heb. ix. 14). 


Without spot (do7fov). Compare 1 Tim. vi. 14; Jas. i. 
27; 2 Pet. iii. 14. In each case in a moral sense. 


Cu. 1.] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 639 


20. Foreordained (apoeyvwcpévov). Lit., and better, fore- 
known, as Rev. 


Manifested (davepwIévros). Observe the difference in tense. 
Foreknown is the perfect participle, has been known from all 
eternity down to the present : “in reference to the place held and 
continuing to be held by Christ in the divine mind ” (Salmond). 
Manifested is the aorist participle, pointing to a definite act at 
a given time. 


In these last times (é7 écydtou tav ypévev). Lit., as Rev., 
at the end of the times. 


21. Which raised. Compare Rom. iv. 24. 


That your faith and hope might be in God. Some ren- 
der, that your faith should also be hope toward God. 


22. Purified (sjyvixdres). The Septuagint translation of the 
Old-Testament technical term for the purification of the people 
and priests (Josh. iii. 5 ; 1 Chron. xv. 12; 1 Sam. xvi. 5). Also, 
of the separation from wine and strong drink by the Nazarite 
(Num. vi. 2-6). In this ceremonial sense, John xi. 55; Acts 
xxi, 24, 26; xxiv. 18. In the moral sense, as here, Jas. iv. 85 
1 John iii. 3. Compare caSapicas, purifying, Acts xv. 9. 


Obeying (éimaxoq). Rev., obedience. A peculiarly New 
Testament term unknown in classical Greek. In the Septuagint 
only 2 Sam. xxii. 36; rendered in A. V. gentleness. Tev., con- 
descension, in margin. 


Unfeigned (dvuréxpitov). °A, not, broxpitHs, actor. The 
latter word is from dzroxpiveo Ia, to answer on the stage, and 
hence to play a part or to act, A hypocrite is, therefore, an 
actor. 


With a pure heart (é« xaIapas xapdias). The best texts re- 
ject xaJapas, pure. Render, therefore, as Rev., from the heart. 


640 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. L 


Fervently (écrevas). Used by Peter only, and only in this 
passage. He uses the kindred adjective éxrevys, wethout ceas- 
ing, in Acts xii. 5, where the narrative probably came from 
him, and alsoat ch. iv. 8; “fervent charity.” The words are 
compounded with the verb teévw, to stretch, and signify i- 
tense strain ; feeling on the rack. 


23. Being born again (avayeyevvnpévor). Rev., having been 
begotten again. Compare Jas. i. 18. 


Of (é«) seed—by (8:4) the word. Note the difference in the 
prepositions; the former denoting the origin or source of life, 
the latter the mediwm through which it imparts itself to the 
nature. 


Word of God (Adyou @eov). The gospel of Christ. Com- 
pare ver. 25, and Peter’s words, Acts x. 36. Also, Eph. i. 13; 
Col. i. 5; Jas. i. 18. Not the personal Word, as the term is 
employed by John. Nevertheless, the connection and relation 
of the personal with the revealed word is distinctly recognized. 
“In the New Testament we trace a gradual ascent from (a) the 
concrete message as conveyed to man by personal agency through 
(0) the Word, the revelation of God to man which the message 
embodies, forming, as it were, its life and soul, to (c) tz Worp, 
who, being God, not only reveals but imparts himself to us, and 
is formed in us thereby” (Scott, on Jas. i. 18, ‘ Speaker’s 
Commentary ”). 


Seed (c7ropds). Nowhere else in the New Testament. Pri- 
marily, the sowing of seed. 


24. Of man. Following the reading avIparov, in the Septu- 
agint, Isa. xl. 6, which Peter quotes here. But the best texts 
read avris, of tt, or, as Rev., thereof. 


Withereth (€&npdv9n). Literally, the writer puts it as in a 
narrative of some quick and startling event, by the use of the 
aorist tense: withered was the grass. Similarly, the flower fel 
(e€émrecev). Lit., fell off, the force of éx. 


Cx. II] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 641 


25. Word of the Lord (fjua xvpiov). Compare ver. 23, 
and note that pjua is used for word, instead of Aédyos; and 
Kipuos, Lord, instead of @eds, God, which is the reading of the 
Hebrew, and of most copies of the Septuagint. The substitu- 
tion indicates that Peter identifies Jesus with God. No very 
satisfactory reason can be given for the change from Adyos to 
phya. It may be due to the Greek translation, which Peter 
follows. 


CHAPTER II. 


1. All (wacav—rrdyvra). Lit., every, or all manner of. 


Evil-speaking (xataXanids). Lit., speakings against. A 
rare word. Only here and 2 Cor. xii. 20. 


2. New=born (dprvuyévyvnta). Peculiar to Peter, and only in 
this passage. Lit., born but just now (dpe). 


Babes (@pégn). The word signifying peculiarly a child a 
birth, or of tender years. See Luke xviii.15; Acts vii.19. Of 
the infant Jesus, Luke ii. 12,16. Here marking the recenc 
of Christian life in the converts addressed. 


Desire (éruroJjoate). The compound is intensive ; earnestly 
desire. So Rev., long for. Compare Philip. ii. 26. 


The sincere milk of the word (70 AoyiKov AdoAov ydna). 
The A. V. has rendered Noysxdr, of the word; but wrongly. It 
describes the quality of the milk as spiritual or rational, as op- 
posed to literal and ceremonial. In the only other place where 
it occurs (Rom. xii. 1) it is rendered reasonable ; which Rev. 
gives here in margin. 


yD 


Sincere (ddoXov) is another epithet of the mk.  Lit., wath- 
out guile, unadulterated. Compare guile in ver. 1. Laying 
aside guile, desire the gudleless milk, etc. Hence Rev. renders 
the whole passage, Long for the spiritual milk which is with- 
out guile. 

41 


642 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IL 


That ye may grow thereby. ‘The best texts add, unto sal- 
vation. 


3. Ve have tasted (éyedcac3e). Aorist tense. More liter, 
ally, ye tasted. “A taste excites the appetite ” (Bengel). Com: 
pare long for, ver. 2, and Ps. xxxiv. 8. 


Gracious (ypnords). Actively benignant, “as distinguished 
from other adjectives which describe goodness on the side of 
its sterling worth and its gentleness” (Salmond). See on Matt. 
Kai OU; 


4. Coming (spocepyduevos). Indicating a close (pos) and 
an habitual (present participle) approach and an intimate asso- 
ciation. 


A living stone (Aé9ov Sava). Omit as unto. So Rev. The 
words are in apposition with whom (Christ). Compare Peter’s 
use of the same word, stone, in Acts iv. 11, and Matt. xxi. 42. 
It is not the word which Christ uses as a personal name for 
Peter (ITérpos) ; so that it is not necessary to infer that Peter 
was thinking of his own new name. 


Disallowed (amoSedoxysacpévov). Rev., rejected. See on 
the simple verb, ch. i. 7. The word indicates rejection after 
trial. 


Of God (wapa Ocd). Of in the A. V. is equivalent to by ; 
but apd has a stronger sense, implying the absolute power 
of decisive choice which is with God. Render, as Rev., with 
God; i.e., God being judge ; and compare Matt. xix. 26 ; Rom. 
aie 


Precious (évreyuov). At ch. i. 19 (precious blood) another 
word is used (téuw0s), denoting essential preciousness. The word 
here indicates the preciousness as recognized or held in honor. 


5. Living stones—built up—a spiritual house. It seems 
as though Peter must have had in mind the conception em- 


Cu. IL] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 6438 


bodied in Christ’s commission to him, of a building erected 
upon a rock. The metaphor of a house built of living stones 
is violent, and sufficiently characteristic of Peter; yet it pict- 
ures, in a very striking way, the union of stability, growth, and 
activity in the ideal church. Note the transition from babes 
growing (ver. 2) to stones built up. But, as Salmond remarks, 
“In Paul we have even bolder instances of apparent confusion 
of metaphors, as when, in one breath, he represents believers 
as at once walking, rooted, and built up in Christ (Col. ii. 6, 7). 


To offer up (avevéyxar). The usual Old-Testament (Septua- 
gint) term for offering of sacrifice. Lit., to bring up to the altar. 
Compare Heb. xiii. 15. The force of avd, wp, appears in the 
fact of the altar being raised. The word is often used of carry- 
ing from a lower to a higher place. Thus Matt. xvii. 1; Luke 
xxiy. 51. In this sense ver. 24 of this chapter is suggestive, 
where it is said that Christ bare (avijveyxey) our sins: carried 
them up to the cross. See note there. 


6. It is contained (aepséyer). From epi, round about, and 
éya, to hold. Hence, to contain or comprehend. So Luke v. 
9, he was astonished (IauBos avrov trepiecyev) ; lit., astonish- 
ment held him encompassed. Also, Acts xxiii. 25, “ He wrote a 
letter after this manner (repiéyovcay tov Titov TovToY) ; lit., 
containing this form. The verb here is impersonal. The kin- 
dred word zrepsoyy occurs only in Acts viii. 32, rendered place ; 
ie., the passage of scripture: either the contents of the passage 
or the section of the book cirewmscribed or marked off. 


In the scripture (é ypadq). The best texts reject the ar- 
ticle. Ipady means a passage of scripture. See on Mark xii. 
10. Hence Rev., én scripture ; margin, im @ scripture. 


Behold I lay, etc. See Rom. ix. 33. 
Precious. See on ver. 4. 


7. He is precious (1) tou). Wrong. Render, as Rev., For 
you therefore which believe is the preciousness (honor, in margin). 


644 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. IL 


Is made the head of the corner (éyevnIn eis xehadny 
yovias). Rev., correctly, “was made.” The preposition eis, 
unto, carrying the idea of coming unto the place of honor, is 
not rendered in A. V. or Rev. Lit., it would be, was made 
or became unto the head, ete. 


9. Generation (yévos). Better, Rev., race: a body with a 
common life and descent. 


Nation (&9vos). People (Aads). The distinction between 
these three words cannot be closely pressed. /?ace emphasizes 
the idea of descent ; nation, of community. Aaos, people, oc- 
curring very often in the Septuagint, is used there mostly of 
the Israelites, the chosen people. The same use is also fre- 
quent in the New Testament; but it is employed in a more 
general sense, as by Luke ii. 10. It would seem that this idea, 
however, in its metaphorical and Christian application, the 
chosen Israel of God, directed Peter’s choice of the word, since 
he adds, a people for God’s own possession. 


Peculiar (es wepimoinow). Lit., a people for acquasition. 
Rev., a people for God’s own possession. Wyec., a people of 
purchasing. Cranmer, a people which are won. The word 
occurs 1 Thess. v. 9, rendered obtaining (Rev.); Eph. i. 14, 
God's own possession (Rev.). See Isa. xliii. 21 (Sept.), where 
the kindred verb occurs: “ This people have I formed for my- 
self (TrepveTronoapny). 


Shew forth (eEayyelAnte). Only here in New Testament. 
Proclain, tell abroad. 


The praises (tas dpetas). Lit., the wrtues. So Rev., ex- 
cellencies. The word occurs Isa. xliii. 21 (Sept., see above), and 
is rendered praise. See, also, Isa. xlii. 12 (Sept.), “ Declare his 
praise (aperas) in the islands.” 


10. People (Aads). See on ver. 9, and note the choice of the 
term here. A people of God. Compare Rom. ix. 25, 26. 


Cu. IL] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 645 


11. Beloved (dyarnroi). A favorite term with Peter, oc- 
curring eight times in the epistles. See the phrase, owr beloved 
Barnabas and Paul, Acts xv. 25, in the letter sent by the 
council at Jerusalem to the Gentile Christians, the account of 
which, doubtless, came from Peter. Compare owr beloved 
brother Paul, 2 Pet. ni. 15. 


Strangers (srapolxous). Rev., sojowrners. Compare ch. i. 
17, “the time of your sojourning (mapouxias).” 


Which (afrives). The compound pronoun denotes a class, 
of that kind which, classifying all fleshly desires in one category. 


12. Conversation. Rev., behavior. See on ch. i. 15. 


Whereas (év 3). Rev., correctly, wherein ; in the matter in 
which. 


They speak against (catadadodow). Compare evil-speak- 
ings, ver. 1, and Acts xxviii. 22. 


Which they shall behold (érromtevovtes). Rev., beholding. 
Used by Peter only, here and ch. iii, 2. The kindred noun 
érémrns, an eye-witness, occurs only at 2 Pet. i. 16. It is a 
technical word, meaning one who was admitted to the highest 
degree of initiation in the Eleusinian mysteries. Here it con- 
veys the idea of personal witness ; behold with their own eyes. 


Evil-doers (xaxoroiwv). The word occurs four times in 
Peter, and nowhere else in the New Testament except John 
xviii. 30, where it is applied by the priests to Christ himself. 


Visitation (éicxomfjs). The radical idea of the word is that 
of observing or inspecting. Hence émicxorros, an overseer or 
bishop. Visiting grows naturally out of this, as wsitare from 
visere, to look at attentively. See Introduction, on Peter’s em- 
phasis upon sight; and compare behold, in this verse. The 
“day of visitation ” is the day of looking upon: “ When God 


646 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. IL 


shall look upon these wanderers, as a pastor over his flock, and 
shall become the overlooker or bishop of their souls ” (ver. 25, 
Lumby). 


13. Submit yourselves (izordynre). Rev., be subject. See 
Rom. xiii. 1 sq. 


Ordinance of man (av9perivy xtice). Lit., to every human 
creation or institution. Rev., creation, in margin. 


King. The emperor, styled king by Greek writers. 


14. Sent (aepuzrouévors). The present participle. In the 
habit of being sent: sent from time to time. 


By him. The king; not the Lord. 


Punishment (éxd/enow). Not strongenough. Better, ven- 
geance, as Rev. Compare Luke xviii. 7; Rom. xii. 19. 


Them that do well (ayaJoz7oudv). Only here in New Tes- 
tament. 


15. Put to silence (¢iuodv). A very graphic word, meaning 
to muzzle or gag. Compare 1 Cor.ix.9; 1 Tim. v.18. See on 
Matt. xxii. 12. 


Ignorance (ayvwciav). In classical Greek it is an ignorance 
arising from not coming into contact with the person or thing 
to be known. It occurs only once again in the New Testament, 
1 Cor. xv. 34. Here it signifies not want of acquaintance, but 
of understanding ; a state of ignorance. 


Of foolish men (rdv adpdvev avIparwv). Of the foolish 
men ; the article referring to those just mentioned, who speak 


against them as evil-doers. 


16. Using (éyovres). Lit., having or holding. 


Cx. IL] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 647 


Cloke (émucddvppa). Only here in New Testament. Lit., 
a veil. The idea is that of using Christian freedom as a mask 
for ungodly license. Paul uses the kindred verb (Rom. iv. 7) 
of the covering of sins. On the sentiment, compare Gal. v. 13. 


18. Servants (oixéras). Household servants. So Rev., in 
margin. Not a common term in the New Testament, occur- 
ring only in three other passages: Luke xvi. 13 ; INGE 9:0. 1S 
Rom. xiv. 4. Some suppose that Peter intended to cover by it 
freedmen and other dependants in the household, or that he 
uses it with a conciliatory purpose, as presenting the slave in 
closer relation with the family. 


Gentle (évexéow). A common derivation of this word is 
from elke, to yield. Hence the meaning, md, yrelding, wn- 
dulgent. But the true derivation is from eixos, reasonable , 
and the word implies rather the not being unduly rigorous ¢ 
“Wherein not strictness of legal right, but consideration for 
one another, is the rule of practice” (Alford). Compare Philip. 
iv. 5, where, for moderation (rd émuetkés), Rev. gives forbear- 
ance, with gentleness in margin. According to Aristotle, the 
word stands in contrast with dxpiBodlxasos, one who rs exuct- 
ingly just, as one who is satisfied with less than has due. 


Froward (cxodwois). Lit., crooked. See Luke iii. 5. Peter 
uses the word in Acts ii. 40 (wntoward) ; and Paul, in Philip. 
ii. 15 (crooked). The word froward is Anglo-Saxon fream-ward 
or from-ward,the opposite of to-ward. (See untoward, above.) 
Thus Ben Jonson: 


“¢ Those that are froward to an appetite ; ” 


ie., averse. Compare the phrases to- God-ward (2 Cor. iii. 4); 
to-us-ward. 


19. Conscience toward God (cuveidnow Oeod). Rev., in 
margin, conscience of God. The idea is not conscientiousness 
in the ordinary sense, but the conscious sense of one’s relation to 
God; his consciousness of God. Thus one suffers patiently, 


648 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. IL 


not from a conscientious sense of duty, but from an inner con- 
sciousness of his relation to God as a son, and to Christ as a 
joint-heir, which involves his suffering with him no less than 
his being glorified with him. 


20. What glory (crofov xréos). Lit., what kind of glory. 
This word for glory occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. 


Buffeted (xoradifowevor). See Matt. xxvi. 67: struck with 
the fist. This whole passage, vv. 19-24, bears the mark of 
Peter’s memories of the scene of Christ’s last sufferings (see 
Introduction)—the blows of the servants, the scorn of the high- 
priest, the silent submission of Jesus, the cross, the stripes. 


21. Leaving (i7roArdvev). Only here in the New Testa- 
ment. 


An example (izoypaupyov). Only here in the New Testa- 
ment. A graphic word, meaning a copy set by writing-masters 
for their pupils. Some explain it as a copy of characters over 
which the student is to trace the lines. 


Follow (éraxorovdnonte). Lit., follow wpon. The com- 
pound verb implies close following. From writers and painters, 
the metaphor changes now to a guide. 


22. Found (evpédn). Stronger than the simple was, and in- 
dicating a guilelessness which had stood the test of scrutiny. 
Compare Matt. xxvi. 60; John xviii. 88; xix. 4, 6. Christ’s 
sinlessness had also stood the test of Peter’s intimacy. 


23. Reviled—again (dvteAoddper). Only here in the New 
Testament. 


Committed himself (rapediéov). But this gives a reflexive 
force to the verb which has no parallel. Commentators are 
divided, some supplying Ais cause, as Rev., in margin; others, 
his judgment ; others, his revilers. Better, the subject of the

Judgeth righteously. Compare without respect of persons, 
chai 1% 


24. Bare (dvijveyxev). See on ver. 5. Bare up to the cross, 
as to an altar, and offered himself thereon. 


The tree (Evdov). Lit., wood. Peter uses the same pecu- 
liar term for the cross, Acts v. 30; x. 39. 


Being dead (dmoyevouevor). Rev., more strictly, having died. 
Used here only in the New Testament. The rendering of the 
verb can be given only in a clumsy way, having become off unto 
sins ; not becoming separate from sins, but having ceased to exist 
as regards them. Compare Rom. vi. 18. 


Stripes (uérw7s). Lit., bruese. So Rev., in margin. Only 
here in New Testament; meaning a bloody wale which arises 
under a blow. “Such a sight we feel sure, as we read this 
descriptive passage, St. Peter’s eyes beheld on the body of his 
Master, and the flesh so dreadfully mangled made the disfigured 
form appear in his eyes like one single bruise” (Lumby). 


95. For ye were as sheep going astray (ire yap ws 
mpoBata TAaV@pEvol) ; 2.€., a8 commonly understood, ye were 
like straying sheep. But the ye were should be construed with 
the participle going astray, the verb and the participle together 
denoting habitual action or condition. Render, as Rev., ye 
were going astray like sheep. See on Mark xii. 24. 


Bishop. See on ver. 12. 


CHAPTER II. 


1, Likewise (éyolws). Rev., in like manner; better, because 
Likewise in popular speech has, wrongly, the sense of also. 
Peter means in like manner with servants (ch. ii. 18). 


650 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca. III 


Be in subjection (iroraccopevan). Lit., being in subjection, 
or submitting yourselves; the same word which is used of the 
submission of servants (ch. ii. 18). 


Be won (xepdSnIjcovra). Rev., be gained. The word used 
by Christ, Matt. xviii. 15: “gained thy brother.” 


2. While they behold (ézomrevcavtes). See on ch. ii. 12. 
Conversation. See onch.i.15. Rev., behavior. 
Coupled with fear (év de8@). Lit., an fear. 


3. OF plaiting (éu7doxfs). Only here in New Testament. 
Compare 1 Tim. ii. 9. The Roman women of the day were 
addicted to ridiculous extravagance in the adornment of the 
hair. Juvenal (“ Satire,” vi.) satirizes these customs. He says: 
“The attendants will vote on the dressing of the hair as if a 
question of reputation or of life were at stake, so great is the 
trouble she takes in quest of beauty ; with so many tiers does 
she load, with so many continuous stories does she build up on 
high her head. She is tall as Andromache in front, behind she 
is shorter. You would think her another person.” The hair 
was dyed, and secured with costly pins and with nets of gold 
thread. False hair and blond wigs were worn. 


Putting on (évdtcews). Only here in New Testament. 
Female extravagance in dress in the days of the empire reached 
an alarming pitch. 


4. Meek (spaéos). See on Matt. v. 5. 


Of great price (aodvredés). The word used to describe 
costly raiment, 1 Tim. ii. 9. 


5. Adorned (éxdcpuouv). Imperfect tense. Were accustomed 
to adorn. 


Cu. IIL} THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 651 


6. Amazement (ronow). Rev., terror. Compare the kin- 
dred verb wrondijre, be terrified, Luke xxi. 9; xxiv. 87; on 
which, see note. The word means a scare, or nervous excite- 
ment. 


7. According to knowledge. With an intelligent recog- 
nition of the nature of the marriage relation. 


The woman (7@ yuvatxel@). Nota noun, however, as would 
appear from the ordinary rendering, but an adjective, agreeing 
with cxever, vessel, as does also aoSevertépw, weaker. Both are 
attributes of vessel ; the female vessel as weaker. So Rev., in 
margin. 


Vessel (cxever). Compare 1 Thess. iv. 4. The primary idea 
of vessel, which is formed from the Latin vasellum, the diminu- 
tive of was, a vase, is that of the receptacle which covers and 
contains; the case or protecting cover. Hence it is allied, ety- 
mologically, with vest, vestment, and wear. It is used in the 
New Testament (1) in the sense of a cup or dish (Luke viii. 
16; John xix. 29; 2 Tim. ii. 20; Apoe. ii. 275; xviii. 12). (2) 
Of the man, as containing the divine energy, or as a subject of 
divine mercy or wrath, and hence becoming a divine instrument. 
Thus Paul is a chosen vessel to bear God’s name (Acts ix. 15). 
Vessels of wrath (Rom. ix. 22) ; of mercy (Rom. ix. 23). So of 
the woman, as God’s instrument, along with man, for his service 
in the family and in society. (8) Collectively, in the plural, 
of all the implements of any particular economy, as a house, or 
aship. Matt. xii. 29, goods ; Acts xxvii. 17, the tackling or 
gear of a ship. 


Giving (arovéuovres). Only here in New Testament. The 
word means, literally, to portion out, and is appropriate to the 
husband as controlling what is to be meted out to the wife. 


Hindered (éyxémrecIa). So A. V. and Rev., and the best 
texts, and the majority of commentators. The word means, 
literally, to knock in; make an incision into; and hence, gen- 


652 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. OL 


erally, to hinder or thwart (Gal. v. 7; 1 Thess. ii. 18). Some, 
however, read éxxdmtea tat, to cut off or destroy. 


8. Of one mind (opodpoves). Rev., Uke-minded. Only here 
in New Testament. Compare Rom. xii. 16; xv. 5; Philip. ii. 
9, ete. Indicating unity of thought and feeling. From ojos, 
one and the same, and ppv, the mind. 


Having compassion one of another (cupuzadeis). Only 
here in New Testament, though the kindred verb is found Heb. 
iv. 15; x. 34. The rendering is needlessly diffuse. Rev., much 
better, compassionate; sympathetic, in margin. Interchange of 
fellow-feeling in joy or sorrow. Our popular usage errs in lim- 
iting sympathy to sorrow. 


Love as brethren (guAddergou). Rev., more strictly, loving 
as brethren. Only here in New Testament. 


Pitiful (evomwAayyvor). Only here and Eph. iv. 32. Rev., 
better, tender-hearted. From ed, well, and omrayxva, the nobler 
entrails, which are regarded as the seat of the affections, and 
hence equivalent to our popular use of heart. The original 
sense has given rise to the unfortunate translation bowe/s in the 
A. V., which occurs in its literal meaning only at Acts i. 18. 


Courteous. The A. V. has here followed the reading of 
the Tex. Rec., @urofpoves. But the best texts read tazresvd- 
gpoves, humble-minded. So Rev. This occurs nowhere else in 
the New Testament, though the kindred noun razrewodpooivn, 
humility, is found often. See on rarrewds, lowly, notes on 
Matt. xi. 29. 


9. Rendering evil, etc. See Rom. xii. 17. 


Blessing (evdoyotvres). Not a noun governed by rendering, 
but a participle. Be not rendering evil, but be blessing. 


10. Will love (9éAwv ayarav). Not the future tense of love, 


Cu. IIL] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 653 


but the verb ¢o will, with the infinitive: he that desires or 
means to love. Rev., would love. 


11. Eschew (éxx\wvdtw). The old word eschew is from the 
Norman eschever, to shun or avoid. It reappears in the Ger- 
man scheuen, to be startled or afraid, and in the English shy, 
and to shy (as a horse). The Greek word here occurs only 
twice elsewhere (Rom. iii. 12; xvi. 17), where Rev. renders 
turn aside and turn away. It is compounded of éx, out of; 
and krive, to cause to bend or slope ; so that the picture in the 
word is of one bending aside from his course at the approach of 
evil. Rev., turn away from. 


13. Followers (uuntal). Lit., imitators. But the best 
texts read fyAwral, zealots. So Rev., zealous. 


14. Blessed. See on Matt. v. 3. 


Be troubled (rapaydjre). The word used of Herod’s trouble 
(Matt. ii. 3); of the agitation of the pool of Bethesda (John v. 
4); of Christ’s troubled spirit (J ohn xii. 27). 


15. Sanctify the Lord God. The A. V. follows the Tex. 
Rec., reading Tov Ocdv, God, instead of tov Xpiorov, Christ, 
which is the reading of the best texts. The article with Christ 
shows that «vpsov, Lord, is to be taken predicatively. Render, 
therefore, as Rev., sanctify Christ (the Christ) as Lord. 


Ready to give an answer (éroiou apos atronoylav). Lit., 
ready for an answer. Answer is our word apology, not in the 
popular sense of excuse, but in the more radical sense of de- 
fence. So it is translated Acts xxii. 1; Philip.i.7,16. Clear- 
ing of yourselves, 2 Cor. vii. 11. 


Meekness. See on Matt. v. 5. 


16. Having a good conscience (cuveidnow éyovtes ayasijv). 
The position of the adjective shows that it is used predica- 


654 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cx. II. 


tively: having a conscience good or unimpaired. Compare 
Heb. xiii. 18, “We have a good conscience (karjv ovveldnow).” 
Svveidnois, conscience, does not occur in the gospels, unless 
John viii. 1-11 be admitted into the text. Nor is it a word 
familiar to classical Greek. It is compounded of ovv, together 
with, and eidévat, to know ; and its fundamental idea is know- 
ing together with one’s self. Hence it denotes the conscious- 
ness which one has within himself of his own conduct as 
related to moral obligation; which consciousness exercises a 
judicial function, determining what is right or wrong, approy- 
ing or condemning, urging to performance or abstinence. Hence 
it is not merely intellectual consciousness directed at conduct, 
but moral consciousness contemplating duty, testifying to moral 
obligation, even where God is not known; and, where there is 
knowledge of God and acquaintance with him, inspired and 
directed by that fact. A man cannot be conscious of himself 
without knowing himself as a moral creature. Cremer accord- 
ingly defines the word as “the consciousness man has of him- 
self in his relation to God, manifesting itself in the form of a 
self-testimony, the result of the action of the spirit in the heart.” 
And further, “conscience is, essentially, determining of the 
self-consciousness by the spirit as the essential principle of life. 
In conscience man stands face to face with himself.” Con- 
science is, therefore, a Zaw. Thus Bishop Butler: “Conscience 
does not only offer itself to show us the way we should walk 
in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it, that it is 
our natural guide, the guide assigned us by the Author of our 
nature ; it therefore belongs to our condition of being; it is our 
duty to walk in that path and follow this guide.” And again, 
“That principle by which we survey, and either approve or 
disapprove our own heart, temper, and actions, is not only to 
be considered as what is, in its turn, to have some influence, 
which may be said of every passion, of the lowest appetites ; 
but likewise as being superior ; as from its very nature claim- 
ing superiority over all others; insomuch that you cannot form 
a notion of this faculty, conscience, without taking in judgment, 
direction, superintendency. This is a constituent part of the 
idea, that is, of the faculty itself; and to preside and govern, 


Cu. IIL] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 655: 


from the very economy and constitution of man, belongs to it. 
Had it strength as it had right; had it power as it had mani- 
fest authority, it would absolutely govern the world” (Sermons 
Ii. and IIL, “On Human Nature ”). 

Conscience is a faculty. The mind may “ possess reason and 
distinguish between the true and the false, and yet be inca- 
pable of distinguishing between virtue and vice. We are en- 
titled, therefore, to hold that the drawing of moral distinctions 
is not comprehended in the simple exercise of the reason. The 
conscience, in short, is a different faculty of the mind from the 
mere understanding. We must hold it to be simple and un- 
resolvable till we fall in with a successful decomposition of it 
into its elements. In the absence of any such decomposition 
we hold that there are no simpler elements in the human mind 
which will yield us the ideas of the morally good and evil, of 
moral obligation and guilt, of merit and demerit. Compound 
and decompound all other ideas as you please, associate them 
together as you may, they will never give us the ideas referred 
to, so peculiar and full of meaning, without a faculty implanted 
in the mind for this very purpose ” (McCosh, “ Divine Govern- 
ment, Physical and Moral ”’). 

Conscience is a sentiment: i.e., it contains and implies con- 
scious emotions which arise on the discernment of an object as 
good or bad. The judgment formed by conscience awakens 
sensibility. When the judicial faculty pronounces a thing to be 
lovable, it awakens love. When it pronounces it to be noble 
or honorable, it awakens respect andadmiration. When it pro- 
nounces it to be cruel or vile, it awakens disgust and abhorrence. 

In scripture we are to view conscience, as Bishop Ellicott re- 
marks, not in its abstract nature, but in its practical manifesta- 
tions. Hence itmay be weak (1 Cor. viii. 7, 12), unauthoritative, 
and awakening only the feeblest emotion. It may be evi or 
defiled (Heb. x. 22; Tit. i. 15), through consciousness of evil 
practice. It may be seared (1 Tim. iv. 2), branded by its own 
testimony to evil practice, hardened and insensible to the appeal 
of good. On the other hand, it may be pure (2 Tim. i. 3), un- 
veiled, and giving honest and clear moral testimony. It may be 
void of offence (Acts xxiv. 16), unconscious of evil intent or act ; 


656 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca. IIL 


good, as here, or honorable (Heb. xiii. 18). The expression and 
the idea, in the full Christian sense, are foreign to the Old Tes- 
tament, where the testimony to the character of moral action 
and character is borne by external revelation rather than by the 
inward moral consciousness. 


Falsely accuse (émrnpedfovtes). Compare Luke vi. 28; the 
only other passage where the word occurs, Matt. v. 44, being re- 
jected from the best texts. The word means to threaten abu- 
swely ; to act despitefully. Rev., revile. 


17. If the will of God be so (ed 3érou 76 JEANwa Tod Oeod). 
More literally, as Rev., preserving the play upon the word wid, 
of the will of God should so will. 


18. The just forthe unjust. But the Greek without the 
article is more graphic : just for unjust. 


In the flesh. The Greek omits the article. Read 7 flesh, 
the material form assumed in his incarnation. 


In the spirit. Also without the article, in spirit ; not as A. 
V., by the Spirit, meaning the Holy Ghost, but referring to 
his spiritual, incorporeal life. The words connect themselves 
with the death-cry on the cross: “ Father, into thy hands I com- 
mend my spirit.” Huther observes, “ Flesh is that side of the 
man’s being by which he belongs to earth, is therefore a creature 
of earth, and accordingly perishable like everything earthy. 
Spirit, on the other hand, is that side of his being according to 
which he belongs to a supernal sphere of being, and is there- 
fore not merely a creature of earth, and is destined to an im- 
mortal existence.” 

Thus we must be careful and not understand spirit here of 
the Spirit of God, as distinguished from the flesh of Christ, 
but of the spiritual nature of Christ ; “the higher spiritual nat- 
ure which belonged to the integrity of his humanity ” (Cook). 


19. By which (év 3). Wrong. Rey., correctly, in which: 
in the spiritual form of life; in the disembodied spirit. 


Cu. III] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 657 


Went and preached (zropevdeis exnpvéev). The word went, 
employed as usual of a personal act ; and preached, in its ordi- 
nary New-Testament sense of proclaiming the Gospel. 


To the spirits (7vevwaow). As in Heb. xii. 23, of disem- 
bodied spirits, though the word wWuyai, souls, is used elsewhere 
(Apoe. svi. 9 5k.) 


In prison (év dvAacy). Authorities differ, some explaining 
by 2 Pet. ii. 4; Jude 6; Apoc. xx. 7, as the final abode of the 
lost. Excepting in the last passage, the word occurs nowhere 
else in the New Testament in a metaphorical sense. It is often 
translated watch (Matt xiv. 25; Luke ii. 8); hold and cage 
(Apoe. xviii. 2). Others explain as Hades, the kingdom of the 
dead generally. 


20. In which (eis jv). Lit., onto which. A pregnant con- 
struction ; into which they were gathered, and im which they 
were saved. 


By water (dia). Rev., through. Some take this as instru- 
mental, by means of water ; others as local, by passing through 
the water, or being brought safely through the water into the 
ark. Rev., in margin, were brought safely through water. 


21. The like figure whereunto. Following a rejected 
reading, @, to which, so that the literal rendering would be the 
antitype to which. Read 6 dvriturov, which, the antitype or as 
an antitype ; i.e., which water, being the antitype of that water 
of the flood, doth now save you, even baptism. Rev., which, 
after a true likeness doth now, etc. °Avriturov, figure, or anti- 
type, is from avri, over against, and tvros, a blow. Hence, 
originally, repelling a blow: a blow against a blow; a counter- 
blow. So of an echo or of the reflection of light; then a cor- 
respondence, as of a stamp to the die, as here. The word oc- 
curs only once elsewhere, Heb. ix. 24: “ the figures of the true.” 


Putting away (a7roJeors). Peculiar to Peter. Here and 2 
Peta. 
42 


658 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IV. 


Filth (fvzrov). Only here in New Testament. In classical 
Greek signifying especially dry dirt, as on the person. 


Answer (émepérnua). Only here in New Testament. In 
classical Greek the word means a question and nothing else. 
The meaning here is much disputed, and can hardly be settled 
satisfactorily. The rendering answer has no warrant. The 
meaning seems to be (as Alford), “the seeking after God of a 
good and pure conscience, which is the aim and end of the 
Christian baptismal life.” So Lange: “The thing asked may 
be conceived as follows: ‘ How shall Irid myself of an evil con- 
science? Wilt thou, most holy God, again accept me, a sin- 
ner? Wilt thou, Lord Jesus, grant me the communion of thy 
death and life? Wilt thou, O Holy Spirit, assure me of grace 
and adoption, and dwell in my heart?’ To these questions the 
triune Jehovah answers in baptism, ‘Yea!’ Now is laid the 
solid foundation for a good conscience. The conscience is not 
only purified from its guilt, but it receives new vital power by 
means of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.” 

This is the sense of éwepwrav eis, in the only place where it 
occurs in scripture, 2 Sam. xi. 7 (Sept.): “David asked of 
him how Joab did (érepworncev eis eipyynv’IwaB).” Lit., woth 
reference to the peace of Joab. Rev. renders, the enterrogation, 
and puts inguiry, appeal, in margin. 


22. Gone into heaven. Perhaps with the scene of the 
ascension in Peter’s mind. 


CHAPTER IV. 


1. Arm yourselves (o7AicacJe). Only here in New Testa- 
ment. The thought is Pauline. See Rom. xiii. 12; 2 Cor. vi. 
{> Eph. Viek0,, Lele Meseewvagos COL iit-.1 2, 


Mind (évvoiav). Only here and Heb. iv.12. Literally the 
word means thought, and so some render it here. Rev. puts it 
in margin. The rendering zntent, resolution, is very doubtful. 


Cu. IV.) THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 659 


It seems rather to be the thought as determining the resolution. 
Since Christ has suffered in the flesh, be ye also willing to suffer 
in the flesh. 


2. Live (Bi@car). Only here in New Testament. 


The rest of the time (ésr/Nourrov). Only here in New Testa- 
ment. 


3. For the time past, etc. Compare Rom. xiii. 13. 
Us (iv). The best texts omit. 
Of our life (rod Biov). The best texts omit. 


Will (SovAnpa, the better reading for S€rnwa). Desire, incl- 
nation. See on Matt. i. 19. 


When we walked (zrezropevpévous). Rev., rightly, ye walked. 
Construe with to have wrought. The time past may suffice for 
you to have wrought the desire, etc., walking as ye have done; 
the perfect participle having an inferential reference to a course 
of life now done with. 


Lasciviousness (acedyelats). The following enumeration 
of vices is characteristic of Peter’s style in its fulness and con- 
densation. He enumerates six forms of sensuality, three per- 
sonal and three social: (1) “Agedyelaus, wantonness. See on 
Mark vii. 22. Excesses of all kinds, with possibly an emphasis 
on sins of uncleanness. (2) E7udupiacs, lusts. See on Mark iv. 
19. Pointing especially to fleshly lusts, “the inner principles 
of licentiousness” (Cook). (3) Oivoddrvyias, excess of wine. 
Only here in New Testament. The kindred verb occurs in the 
Septuagint, Deut. xxi. 20; Isa. lvi. 12. From oivos, wine, and 
préw or Prva, to teem with abundance ; thence to bodl over or 
bubble up, overflow. It is the excessive, insateate desire for drink, 
from which comes the use of the word for the indulgence of 
the desire—debauch. So Rev., wine-bibbings. The remaining 
three are revellings, banquetings, and idolatrees. 


660 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IV. 


Revellings («opos). The word originally signifies merely 
a merry-making ; most probably a village festival, from KOLN, 
a village. In the cities such entertainments grew into carouses, 
in which the party of revellers paraded the streets with torches, 
singing, dancing, and all kinds of frolics. These revels also 
entered into religious observances, especially in the worship of 
Bacchus, Demeter, and the Idaean Zeus in Crete. The fanatic 
and orgiastic rites of Egypt, Asia Minor, and Thrace became 
engrafted on the old religion. Socrates, in the introduction to 
“The Republic,” pictures himself as having gone down to the 
Piraeus to see the celebration of the festival of Bendis, the 
Thracian Artemis (Diana); and as being told by one of his 
companions that, in the evening, there is to be a torch-race with 
horses in honor of the goddess. The rites grew furious and 
ecstatic. ‘Crowds of women, clothed with fawns’ skins, and 
bearing the sanctified thyrsus (a staff wreathed with vine-leaves) 
flocked to the solitudes of Parnassus, Kithaeron, or Taygetus 
during the consecrated triennial period, and abandoned them- 
selves to demonstrations of frantic excitement, with dancing 
and clamorous invocation of the god. They were said to tear 
animals limb from limb, to devour the raw flesh, and to cut 
themselves without feeling the wound. The men yielded to a 
similar impulse by noisy revels in the streets, sounding the 
cymbals and tambourine, and carrying the image of the god 
in procession” (Grote, “ History of Greece”). Peter, in his 
introduction, addresses the sojourners in Galatia, where the 
Phrygian worship of Cybele, the great mother of the gods, pre- 
vailed, with its wild orgies and hideous mutilations. Lucretius 
thus describes the rites : 


‘¢ With vigorous hand the clamorous drum they rouse, 
And wake the sounding cymbal ; the hoarse horn 
Pours forth its threatening music, and the pipe, 

With Phrygian airs distracts the maddening mind, 
While arms of blood the fierce enthusiasts wield 

To fright the unrighteous crowds, and bend profound 
Their impious souls before the power divine. 

Thus moves the pompous idol through the streets, 
Scattering mute blessings, while the throngs devout 
Strew, in return, their silver and their brass, 


Cu. IV.) THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 661 


Loading the paths with presents, and o’ershade 
The heavenly form ; and all th’ attending train, 
With dulcet sprays of roses, pluckt profuse, 
A band select before them, by the Greeks 
Curetes called, from Phrygian parents sprung, 
Sport with fantastic chains, the measured dance 
Weaving infuriate, charmed with human blood, 
And madly shaking their tremendous crests.” 
De Rerun Natura, ii., 618-631. 


Banquetings (dros). Lit., drinking-bouts. Rev., carous- 
Mgs. 


Abominable (a9euirous). Only here, and by Peter in Acts 
x. 28. More literally, wnlaw/ful, emphasizing the idolatries as 
violations of divine law. 


4. Run not with them. “In a troop” (Bengel); like a 
band of revellers. See above. Compare Ovid’s description of 
the Bacchic rites : 


‘¢ Lo, Bacchus comes! and with the festive cries 
Resound the fields ; and mixed in headlong rout, 
Men, matrons, maids, paupers, and nobles proud, 
To the mysterious rites are borne along.” 
Metamorphoses, iii., 528-530. 


Excess (dvdyvow). Only here in New Testament. bie, 
pouring forth. Rev. has flood in margin. The word is used 
in classical Greek of the ¢ides which fill the hollows. 


Riot (acwrias). From a, not, and catw, to save. Lit., wn- 
savingness, prodigality, wastefulness; and thence of squander- 
ing on one’s own debased appetites, whence it takes the sense 
of dissoluteness or profligacy. In Luke xv. 13, the kindred ad- 
verb dcdtas is used. The prodigal is described as scattering 
his substance, to which is added, living wastefully (Gav ag@TwS). 
Compare Eph. v. 18; Tit. 1. 6. 


5. That is ready (éroduas éyovrs). Lit., having himself in 
readiness ; there at God’s right hand in heaven, whither he has 


662 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca. IV. 


gone (ch, ii. 22). Implying, also, a near judgment. Compare 
Were (: 


7. Is at hand (jyyxev). Lit., has come near. The word 
constantly used of the coming of Christ and his kingdom. See 
Matt. iii. 2; Mark i.15; Luke x. 9; Heb. x. 25. 


Be ye sober (cwppovyjcate). The word is from ods, sound, 
and piv, the mind. Therefore, as Rev., be ye of sound mind. 
Compare Mark v. 15. 


Watch (yppare). See on ch. i.18. The A. V. has followed 
the Vulgate, wegilate (watch). Rev. is better: be sober. 


Unto prayer (eis mpocevyds). Lit., prayers. The plural is 
used designedly : prayers of all kinds, private or public. Tynd. 
renders, Be ye discreet and sober, that ye may be apt to prayers. 
Compare Eph. vi. 18, “with every kind of prayer, and watch- 
ing thereunto.” 


8. Fervent (€xrevj). See, on the kindred adverb fervently, 
notes on ch. 1. 22. 


Love covereth, etc. Compare Jas. v. 20; Prov. x. 12. 
9. Using hospitality. Compare Rom. xiii. 13. 


10. A gift (ydpucua). Originally, something freely given: 
a gift of grace (xapis). Used in New Testament (a) of a dless- 
ing of God graciously bestowed, as upon sinners (Rom. vy. 15, 
16; xi. 29); (b) of a gracious divine endowment: an extraor- 
dinary gift of the Holy Spirit dwelling and working in a special 
manner in the individual (1 Tim. iv. 14; 2 Tim. i.6; Rom. xii. 
6, 8). So here. 


Manifold. See on ch. i. 6. 


11. Oracles (Adyia). In classical Greek, of the oracular re- 


Cu. IV.] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 663 


sponses of heathen deities. Here, divine utterances or revela- 
tions. Compare Acts vii. 88; Rom. iii. 2; Heb. v. 12. 


Giveth (yopnyez). Only here and 2 Cor. ix. 10. Peter uses 
the compound émeyopnyéa, furnish, in 2 Pet. i. 5; which see. 


12. Think it not strange (ui Eeviterde). Le., alien from 
you and your condition as Christians. Compare v. 4. 


Fiery trial (rupéce). The word means burning. In Prov. 
xxvii. 21 (Sept.), it is rendered furnace. In Ps. lxv. (Sept.), 
Ixvi. (A. V.), we read, “Thou, O God, hast proved us: thou 
hast smelted us, as silver is smelted.” Compare Zech. xiii. 9. 


Which is to try you (Spiv yevouévy). The A. V. thus makes 
the trial a thing of the future ; mistranslating the Greek present 
participle, which is taking place. This participle, therefore, 
represents the trial as actually in progress. The Rev. does not 
give this force by its which cometh upon you. 


To try you (rpos metpacpov). Lit., for trial or probation. 
Strange thing (févov). Compare think it not strange, above. 


Happened (cvpBaivovros). Again the present participle. 
Better, perhaps, were happening; by chance, instead of with 
the definite purpose indicated by “taking place with a view to 
probation.” See above. 


13. Inasmuchas ye are partakers. Compare Rom. viii. 17. 


Be glad with exceeding joy (xapiire ayahhwpevor). Lits 
ye may rejoice exulting. See on ch. i. 6. 


14. The spirit of glory and of God (r6 rijs 50&ns Kat ro Tod 
Ocob veda). Lit., the spirit of glory and that of God. The 
repetition of the article identifies the spirit of God with the 
spirit of glory: the spirit of glory, and therefore the spirit of 


664 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. V. 


God : who is none other than the spirit of God himself. Hence 
Rev., better, the spirit of glory and the spirit of God. 


Resteth (dvaravera), Compare Isa. xi. 2; Luke x. 6; Num. 
xi. 25, 26; Mark vi. 831; Matt. xxvi. 45; Apoe. xiv. 13. Also, 
Matt. xi. 28, where the word is used in the active voice, to gwe 
rest or refreshment. 


15. A busybody in other men’s matters (a\dotpioeric- 
xomros). Only here in New Testament. Lit., the overseer of 
another’s matters. One who usurps authority in matters not 
within his province. Rev., meddler. Compare Luke xii. 13, 
14; 1 Thess. iv. 11; 2 Thess. iii. 11. It may refer to the offi- 
cious interference of Christians in the affairs of their Gen- 
tile neighbors, through excess of zeal to conform them to the 
Christian standard. 


16. A Christian. Only three times in the New Testament, 
and never as a name used by Christians themselves, but as a 
nickname or a term of reproach. See on Acts xi. 26. Hence 
Peter’s idea is, if any man suffer from the contumely of those 
who contemptuously style him Christian. 


19. Commit (rapatitécJwoav). Give in charge as a de- 
posit. Compare Luke xii.48; Acts xx. 32; 1 Tim.i.18. The 
word is used by Christ in commending his soul to God (Luke 
xxiil. 46). 


Well-doing (aya9orog). Only here in New Testament. 
Compare ch. ii. 14. The surrender to God is to be coupled 
with the active practice of good. 


CHAPTER V. 


1. Also an elder (cuumpecBvrepos). Only here in New 
Testament. Better, as Rev., fellow-elder. The expression is 
decisive against the primacy of Peter. 


Cu. V.] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 665 


Witness (udptus). The word is used in the New Testament 
to denote (a) a spectator or eye-witness (Acts x. 39; vi. 13). (6) 
One who testifies to what he has seen (Acts i. 8; v. 32). (ce) 
In the forensic sense, a witness in court (Matt. xxvi. 65; Mark 
xiv. 63). (d@) One who vindicates his testimony by suffering: a 
martyr (Acts xxii. 20; Heb. xii. 1; Apoce. ii. 13; xvii.6). The 
first three meanings run into each other. The eye-witness, as 
a spectator, is always such with a view to giving testimony. 
Hence this expression of Peter cannot be limited to the mere 
fact of his having seen what he preached; especially since, 
when he wishes to emphasize this fact, he employs another 
word, evdmrns (2 Pet. i. 16). Therefore he speaks of himself 
as a witness, especially in the sense of being called to testify of 
what he has seen. 


Partaker (xowwvds). This use of the word, expressing a 
present realization of something not yet attained, occurs in no 
other writer in the New Testament. See on 2 Pet. i. 4. 


2. Feed (oavare). Better, Rev., tend, since the verb de- 
notes all that is included in the office of a shepherd—guiding, 
guarding, folding, no less than feeding, which latter is expressed 
by Boon. There is, doubtless, a reminiscence in the word of 
Christ’s charge to Peter (John xxi. 15-17). Both words are used 
there: “ Heed (Boone) my lambs” (ver. 15); “tend (roiwasve) 
my sheep ” (ver. 16); “feed (Boone) my sheep” (ver.17). The 
A. V. obliterates the distinction by rendering all three feed. 
Bengel rightly remarks, “ Feeding is part of tending.” See 
on Matt. ii. 6. 


Taking the oversight. The best textsomit. ev. retains. 
By constraint (dvayxaorTds). Only here in New Testament. 
Willingly (écovciws). Only here and Heb. x. 26. 


For filthy lucre (aicypoxepdas). From aioypds, disgrace- 
ful, and xépSos, gain. Only here in New Testament. The 


666 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca. V. 


word filthy is intended to convey the idea which lies in aicypos, 
base or dishonorable ; becoming such if it is made the motive 
of the minister’s service. Compare 2 Cor. xii. 14. 


Willingly (apo9vpes). Not strong enough. The word is 
compounded of mpé, forward, and Supds, heart or spirit. Hence 
Rev., with a ready mind ; a forward spirit ; denoting not mere 
willingness, but zeal. Only here in New Testament. Compare 
the kindred adjective mpd9upos, ready (Rom. i. 15; Matt. xxvi. 
41; Mark xiv. 38), and the kindred noun mpodupia, readiness 
(2: Cor. viii. LL, 12, 19s pie): 


3. As lording it (kataxvpsevovtes). See Matt. xx. 25; Acts 
xix. 16. Other words are used for the exercise of legitimate 
authority in the church: rpotorapas, to be over (1 Thess. v. 12 ; 
1 Tim. v. 17) ; qocpaive, as ver. 2, tend. But this carries the 
idea of high-handed rule. 


Heritage (kAnpov). Plural. Kyzjpos means a@ lot. See on 
inheritance, ch. i. 4. From the kindred adjective «dnpixos 
comes the English cleric, contracted into clerk, which in eccle- 
siastical writings originally signified a minister ; either as being 
chosen by lot like Matthias, or as being the lot or inheritance of 
God. Hence Wycliffe translates the passage, “neither as hav- 
ing lordship in the clergie.” As in the Middle Ages the clergy 
were almost the only persons who could write, the word clerk 
came to have one of its common modern meanings. The word 
here, though its interpretation is somewhat disputed, seems to 
refer to the several congregations—the lots or charges assigned 
to the elders. Compare mrpocexdnpodnoarv, were added as dis- 
ciples; A. V., consorted with (Acts xvii. 4). Rev. renders 
charge. Why not charges? 


Examples (cvuzoz). Peter uses three different terms for a 
pattern or model: broypappos, a writing-copy (ch. ii. 21); 
vrroderyuua, for which classical writers prefer mapdderypa, an 
architect's plan or a sculptor’s or painter's model (2 Pet. ii. 6); 
totros (see on ch. ili. 21), of which our word type is nearly a 


Cu. V.J THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 667 


transcript. The word primarily means the impression left by 
a stroke (tumta, to strike). Thus John xx. 25, “the print of 
the nails.” Used of the stamp on coin; the impression of any 
engraving or hewn work of art; a monument or statue; the 
Jigures of the tabernacle of Moloch and of the star Remphan 
(Acts vii. 43). Generally, an dmage or form, always with a 
statement of the object ; and hence the kindred meaning of a 
pattern or model. See Acts xxiii. 25; Rom. v. 14; Philip. 
iii. 17; Heb. viii. 5. 


4. The chief Shepherd (apyuroipevos). Only here in New 
Testament. In harmony with ver. 2. ‘The last thing Peter 
could have dreamed of as possible would be its misapplication 
to himself or his so-called successors” (Cook). Compare Heb. 
xiii. 20, great Shepherd ; and John x. 11, 14, good Shepherd. 
Also, Ezek. xxxiv. 15, 16, 23. 


Ye shall receive. See on recewing, 1 Pet. i. 9. 


Crown (créfavov). From otépw, to put round, encircle. 
It is the crown of victory in the games; of military valor; the 
marriage wreath, or the festal garland, woven of leaves or made 
of gold in imitation of leaves. Thus it is distinguished from 
the royal crown, which is dsddnua, of which diadem is a tran- 
script. In Paul, orépavos is always used of the conqueror’s 
crown, not of the king’s (1 Cor. ix. 24-26; 2 Tim. ii. 5). 
Though it is urged that Peter would not have employed a 
reference to the crown of the victors in the games, because of 
the abhorrence of the Palestinian Jews for heathen spectacles, 
yet the reference to the crown of leaves seems to be determined 
by the epithet wnfading, as compared with garlands of earthly 
leaves. The crown of thorns woven for Jesus is called orépa- 
vos, with reference rather to its being twimed than to its being 
a caricature of a kingly crown. 


5. Be clothed with humility (tv tazrewodpocivny éyKop- 
BocacSe). The last word is a very peculiar one, occurring 
only here. It is derived from «duos, a roll, band, or girth: 


668 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. V. 


a knot or roll of cloth, made in tying or tucking up any part of 
the dress. The kindred word éyxéuBopa, from which the verb 
is directly formed, means a slave’s apron, under which the loose 
garments were girt up. Compare Horace’s “ puer alte cinctus,” 
a slave girt high. ence the figure carries an exhortation to 
put on humility as a working virtue employed in minestry. 
This is apparent from the evident reminiscence of that scene 
in which Peter figured so prominently—the washing of the dis- 
ciples’ feet by the Lord, when he gerded himself with a towel 
ag a servant, and gave them the lesson of ministry both by word 
and act. Bengel paraphrases, “ Put on and wrap yourselves 
about with humility, so that the covering of humility cannot 
possibly be stripped from you.” 


Resisteth (dvritdoceras). A strong and graphic word. Lit., 
setteth himself in array against, as one draws out a host for 
battle. Pride calls out God’s armies. No wonder, therefore, 
that it “ goeth before destruction.” 


The proud (émepnpdvos). See on pride, Mark vil. 22. 
Compare Jas. iv. 6. 


To the humble. See on Matt. xi. 29. 


6. Mighty hand (xparavay yetpa). A phrase found no- 
where else in the New Testament, but occurring in the Sep- 
tuagint, Ex. iii, 19; Deut. iii. 24; Job xxx. 21. The adjective 
xparavav, mighty, is, moreover, used only here. Compare Luke 
i. 51, 52. 


7. Casting (émippiapavres). The aorist participle denoting 
an act once for all; throwing the whole life with its care on 
him. 


All your care (rdcav thy pépysvav). The whole of your 
care. ‘ Not every anxiety as it arises, for none will arise if 
this transferrence has been effectually made.” Care. See on 
Matt. vi. 25, take no thought. Rev., rightly, anaiety. 


Cu. V.] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 669 


He careth (udder). Meaning the watchful care of interest 
and affection. The sixth and seventh verses should be taken 
together: Humble yourselves and cast all your anaiety. Pride 
is at the root of most of our anxiety. To human pride it is 
humiliating to cast everything upon another and be cared for. 
See Jas. iv. 6, 7. 


8. Be sober (viyrate). See on ch. iv. 7. 


Be vigilant (ypnyopijcare). Rev., be watchful. See on Mark 
xiii. 35; and 1 Thess. v. 6, where both verbs occur: watch and 
be sober. A reminiscence of the scene in Gethsemane: Cold 
ye not watch with me? (Matt. xxvi. 40, 41). 


Adversary (6 avrééuxos). The article points to a well-known 
adversary. From dvri, against, and dixn, a lawsuit. Strictly, 
an adversary in a lawsuit. Here an adversary in general. Com- 
pare Zech. iii. 1-5. Only here, in New Testament, of Satan. 


The devil. See on Matt. iv. 1. 


Roaring (@pudpevos). Only here in New Testament. The 
word conveys somewhat of the sense by the sound (orwomenos). 
It denotes especially the howl of a beast in fierce hunger. 


Lion. Augustine says, “Christ is called ‘a lion’ (Apoc. v. 
5) because of his courage: the devil, because of his ferocity. 
The one lion comes to conquer, the other to hurt.” Seven 
Hebrew words are used for this animal; six to describe his 
movements and four to describe his roar. He is mentioned in 
the Bible about one hundred and thirty times. In Job iv. 10, 
11, five different words are used for him. In Judges xiv. 5; 
Ps, xxi. 13; ciii. 21 (Sept.), the same word as here is used for 
the roaring of the lion as a translation of the Hebrew word for 
the thunder in Job xxxvii. 4. 


Walketh about (zeperaret). Compare Jobi.7; ii. 2. This 
word gave name to that sect of Greek philosophers known as 
Peripatetics, because they walked about while teaching or dis- 


670 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. V. 


puting. “St. Peter calls Satan the Peripatetic” (Cox, on Job). 
The Arabs call him the Busy One. It was to Peter that Christ 
said, “Satan hath desired to have you,” etc. (Luke xxii. 31). 


Devour (xararrin). Lit., swallow down. See on Matt. xxiii. 
24. 


9. Resist (avtiornte). The Rev., very judiciously, substi- 
tutes withstand ; resist having been already used in ver. 5 for 
avtitdaoetar. Withstand is, moreover, the more accurate ren- 
dering ; as the verb means rather to be jirm against onset than 
to strive against it. With in withstand is the Saxon wid, 
against, which appears in the German wider. 


Steadfast (crepeol). Compare 2 Tim. ii. 19; and the kindred 
verb atepedw, to strengthen (Acts iii. 7,16; xvi. 5). Paul, in 
Col. ii. 5, uses a cognate noun, oTepéwma, evidently as a military 
metaphor: “ Beholding your order (rd&wv, compare avtutdooerat, 
ver. 5) and your solid front or close phalanx” (otepéwpa). It 
might be difficult to find, on the whole, a better rendering than 
steadfast, yet it falls a little short of the meaning. Steadfast 
is Anglo-Saxon, stede, a place, and fuest, fast ; and hence means 
jurm in its place; but orepeot conveys also the sense of compact- 
ness, compact solidity, and is appropriate, since a number of in- 
dividuals are addressed and exhorted to withstand the onset of 
Satan as one compacted body. Srepeds implies solidity in the 
very mass and body of the thing itself; steadfastness, mere hold- 
ing of place. A rockis orepeds, jirm, solid ; buta flexible weed 
with its tough roots resisting all efforts to pull it up, may be 
steadfast. The exhortation is appropriate from Peter, the Rock. 


The same afflictions (ra aita Trav wadnudtov). Rev., bet- 
ter, sufferings. A very peculiar construction, occurring nowhere 
else in the New Testament. Lit., the same things of sufferings, 
emphasizing the idea of zdentity. 


Are accomplished (émutedeicSar). More correctly, are be- 
img accomplished. The present infinitive denotes something in 
process of accomplishment. 


Cx. V.] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 671 


Brethren (dd5erdorntt). Lit., brotherhood. Only here and 
chai LT: 


10. Who hath called us (6 xadécas suas). But the tense is 
the aorist, and the true reading is duds, you, instead of ws. Ren- 
der, therefore, as Rev., who called you ; before the foundation 
of the world. See Rom. viii. 29, 30, and compare wnto his 
eternal glory and them he also glorified. 


By Christ Jesus (év Xpicré “Incod). The best texts omit 
Jesus. So Rev., which also renders, better, 7 Christ, denoting 
the sphere or clement in which the calling and its results take 
place: “ Christ as the life, head, and very principle of all exist- 
ence to the Christian ” (Cook). 


Awhile (éAéyov). Rev., more literally, a little while. See 
on ch. i. 6. 


Make you perfect, etc. The Tex. Rec. makes this and the 
three following verbs in the optative mood, expressing a wish. 
So the A. V. But the best texts make them all indicative 
future, and thus convert the wish or prayer into an assurance. 
Thus, then, 


Shall himself perfect (adrés xataptice). The A. V. over- 
looks the adros, himself, which is very significant as indicating 
God’s personal interest and energy in the work of confirming 
his children. 

Shall perfect. Rev. reads restore, in margin. The root of 
this word appears in dpw or dpapioxa, to fit or join together. 
So dp9pov means a joint. The radical notion of the verb is, 
therefore, adjustment—the putting of all the parts into right 
relation and connection. We find it used of mending the nets 
(Matt. iv. 21), and of restoring an erring brother (Gala vain 1); 
of framing the body and the worlds (Heb. x. 5; Xi.3)i, OLE 
union of members in the church (1 Cor. i. 10; 2 Cor. xiii. 11). 
Out of this comes the general sense of perfecting (Matt. xxi. 
16; Luke vi. 40; 1 Thess. ii. 10). 


672 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. V. 


Shall stablish (ornpéEe). The word is akin at the root to 
atepeds, steadfast (ver. 9), and is the very word used by Christ 
in his exhortation to Peter, “strengthen thy brethren ” (Luke 
xxii. 32). Possibly there is a reminiscence of this in Peter’s 
use of the word here. Compare 1 Thess. iii. 13; 2 Thess. ii. 
17 Jasevs 85 A poe mis 2: 


Shall strengthen (cSevecer). Only here in New Testa- 
ment. Compare Eph. iii. 16. 


Shall settle (Seuchudcer). Omitted by some texts, and by 
Rev. From Jepuérsos, a foundation. The radical notion of the 
word is, therefore, to ground securely. It occurs in Matt. vii. 25, 
of the house founded on a rock; in Heb. i. 10, of laying the 
foundations of the earth. In Eph. iii. 18, it is joined with 
rooted. The massing of these expressions, unconnected by con- 
junctions, indicates strong feeling. Bengel thus sums up the 
whole: ‘Shall perfect, that no defect remain in you: shall stab- 
lish, that nothing may shake you: shall strengthen, that you 
may overcome every adverse force. A saying worthy of Peter. 
He is strengthening his brethren.” 


12. Silvanus. Probably the companion of Paul known in 
the Acts as Silas (xv. 22, 27, 32, 34, 40, etc.), and called Szd- 
vanus by Paul in 2 Cor. i. 19; 1 Thess. 1.1; 2 Thess. i. 1. 


A faithful brother. Brother has the definite article, the 
faithful brother, designating him as one well known for his 
fidelity. Rev. renders owr, with the in margin. 


Unto you. Construe, not as A. V., a brother unto you, but 
I have written unto you. So Rev. 


As | suppose (as Aoyifouat). Too feeble, since the verb de- 
notes a settled persuasion or assurance. See Rom. iii. 28, “ we 
conclude” or reckon, as the result of our reasoning. Compare 
Rom. viii. 18; Heb. xi. 19. Rev., as [account him. 


Cu. V.] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 673 


| have written (éypawa). Lit., Z wrote. An example of 
what is known as the epistolary aorist. The writer regards the 
time of writing as his correspondent will do when he shall have 
received the letter. We say in a letter, Zwrite. Paul, writing 
to Philemon, says dvémreuyra, J sent ; since to Philemon the act 
of sending would be already past. Therefore in using this form 
of expression Peter does not refer to the second epistle, nor to 
another now lost, but to the present epistle. 


Briefly (dv dAdyov). Lit., through few (words). Compare 
Heb. xiii. 22, where the expression is 80a Bpayéwv, through 
brief words. 


Testifying (éripaptupdv). Only here in New Testament. 
See on ver. 1. 


Wherein ye stand (eis jv éotjxate). The best texts read 
oThre, imperative. So Rev., stand ye fast therein. Lit., “into 
which stand,” the preposition with the verb having the preg- 
nant force of entering into and standing fast zn. 


13. The church. The word is not in the Greek, but is sup- 
plied with the feminine definite article 7. There is, however, 
a difference of opinion as to the meaning of this feminine ar- 
ticle. Some suppose a reference to Peter’s own wife; others, 
to some prominent Christian woman in the church. Compare 
2 John 1. The majority of interpreters, however, refer it to 
the church. 


Babylon. Some understand in a figurative sense, as mean- 
ing Rome; others, literally, of Babylon on the Euphrates. In 
favor of the former view are the drift of ancient opinion and 
the Roman Catholic interpreters, with Luther and several noted 
modern expositors, as Ewald and Hoffmann. This, too, is the 
view of Canon Cook in the “ Speaker’s Commentary.” In favor 
of the literal interpretation are the weighty names of Alford, 
Huther, Calvin, Neander, Weiss, and Reuss. Professor Sal- 
mond, in his admirable commentary on this epistle, has so forcibly 
summed up the testimony that we cannot do better than to give 

43 


674 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. V. 


his comment entire: “In favor of this allegorical interpreta- 
tion it is urged that there are other occurrences of Babylon in 
the New Testament as a mystical name for Rome (Apoc. xiv. 
8; xviii. 2, 10); that it is in the highest degree unlikely that 
Peter should have made the Assyrian Babylon his residence or 
missionary centre, especially in view of a statement by Josephus 
indicating that the Emperor Claudius had expelled the Jews 
from that city and neighborhood ; and that tradition connects 
Peter with Rome, but not with Babylon. The fact, however, 
that the word is mystically used in a mystical book like the 
Apocalypse—a book, too, which is steeped in the spirit and ter- 
minology of the Old Testament—is no argument for the mysti- 
cal use of the word in writings of a different type. The alle- 
gorical interpretation becomes still less likely when it is observed 
that other geographical designations in this epistle (ch. i. 1) have 
undoubtedly the literal meaning. The tradition itself, too, is 
uncertain. The statement in Josephus does not bear all that it 
is made to bear. There is no reason to suppose that, at the 
time when this epistle was written, the city of Rome was cur- 
rently known among Christians as Babylon. On the contrary, 
wherever it is mentioned in the New Testament, with the sin- 
gle exception of the Apocalypse (and even there it is distin- 
guished as ‘ Babylon, the great’), it gets its usual name, Rome. 
So far, too, from the Assyrian Babylon being practically in a 
deserted state at this date, there is very good ground for believ- 
ing that the Jewish population (not to speak of the heathen) of 
the city and vicinity was very considerable. For these and 
other reasons a succession of distinguished interpreters and his- 
torians, from Erasmus and Calvin, on to Neander, Weiss, Reuss, 
Huther, etc., have rightly held by the literal sense.” 


Marcus. Rev., Mark. John Mark, the author of the gos- 
pel. See Introduction to Mark, on his relations to Peter. 


My son. Probably in a spiritual sense, though some, as 
Bengel, think that Peter’s own son is referred to. 


14. Kiss of charity. Compare 1 Cor. xvi. 20. 


THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF 
PETER. 


CHAPTER TI. 


1. Simon Peter. Note the addition of Simon, and see on 
1 Pet.i.1. The best-attested orthography is Symeon, which 
is the form of his name in Acts xv. 14, where the account 
probably came from him. This also is the Hebraic form of the 
name found in the Septuagint, Gen. xxix. 33, and elsewhere. 
Compare Apoc. vii. 7; Luke ii. 25, 34; i. 30; Acts xii. 1. 
The combined name, Simon Peter, is found Luke v. 8; John 
xiii. 6; xx.2; xxi. 15, and elsewhere, though in these instances 
it is given as Simon; Symeon occurring only in Acts xv. 14. 
While his name is given with greater familiarity than in the 
first epistle, his official title, servant and apostle, is fuller. This 
combination, servant and apostle, occurs in no other apostolic 
salutation. The nearest approach to it is Tit. i. 1. 


Of Jesus Christ. The word Christ never occurs in the 
second epistle without Jesus ; and only in this instance without 
some predicate, such as Lord, Saviour. 


To them that have obtained (rots Aayotow). Lit., ob- 
tained by lot. So Luke i.9; John xix. 24. In the sense which 
it has here it is used by Peter (Actsi. 17) of Judas, who had 
obtained part of this ministry. In this sense it occurs only in 
that passage and here. 


676 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. I. 


Like precious (/cdtuuov). Only here in New Testament. 
The word should be written éke-precious. Compare precious 
in 1 Pet. i. 7, 19; ii. 4, 6, 7. Not the same in measure to all, 
but having an equal value and honor to those who receive it, as 
admitting them to the same Christian privileges. 


With us. Most probably the Jewish Christians, of whom 
Peter was one. Professor Salmond remarks, ‘ There is much 
to show how alien it was to primitive Christian thought to re- 
gard Gentile Christians as occupying in grace the self-same 
platform with Christians gathered out of the ancient church of 
God.” See Acts xi. 17; xv. 9-11. 


Saviour. Frequently applied to Christ in this epistle, but 
never in the first. 


2. In the knowledge (év ézuyvoce). The compound ex- 
pressing full knowledge, and so common in Paul’s writings. 


Our Lord (xvpiov jyov). The word Zord in the second 
epistle is always used of God, unless Chrzst or Saviour is added. 


3. Hath granted (dedwpnuévns). This is the only word 
which Peter and Mark alone have in common in the New Tes- 
tament; a somewhat singular fact in view of their intimate 
relations, and of the impress of Peter upon Mark’s gospel: yet 
it tells very strongly against the theory of a forgery of this 
epistle. The word is stronger than the simple diSwpu, to give, 
meaning to grant or bestow as a gift. Compare Mark xv. 45. 


Godliness (evcéBevav). Used only by Peter (Acts iii. 12), 
and in the Pastoral Epistles. It is from ed, well, and céBopat, 
to worshap, so that the radical idea is worship rightly directed. 
Worship, however, is to be understood satesloeaalolosinnkcate I 
worth-ship, or reverence paid to worth, whether in God or 
man. So Wycliffe’s rendering of Matt. vi. 2, “ that they be wor- 


shipped of men;” and “worship thy father and thy mother,” 
Matt. xix. 19. In classical Greek the word is not confined to 


Cu. 1] THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 677 


religion, but means also prety in the fulfilment of human rela- 
tions, like the Latin pietas. Even in classical Greek, however, 
it is a standing word for prety in the religious sense, showing 
itself in right reverence; and is opposed to dvocéBeta, wn- 
godliness, and avons, profaneness. “The recognition of 
dependence upon the gods, the confession of human depend- 
ence, the tribute of homage which man renders in the certainty 
that he needs their favor—all this is edcéSeca, manifest in con- 
duct and conversation, in sacrifice and prayer” (Niagelsbach, 
cited by Cremer). This definition may be almost literally trans- 
ferred to the Christian word. It embraces the confession of 
the one living and true God, and life corresponding to this 
knowledge. See on ver. 2. 


Called (xadXécavtos). Also used of the divine invitation, 
PVPernsd, 2m 9 sy. 10. 


To glory and virtue ((d/¢ 56£y «ai aperh). Lit., and prop- 
erly, by his own glory and virtue, though some read Sia d0&ns 
cat aperhs, through glory and virtue. Rev. adopts the former. 
The meaning is much the same in either case. 


His own (idéa). Of frequent occurrence in Peter, and not 
necessarily with an emphatic force, since the adjective is some- 
times used merely as a possessive pronoun, and mostly so in 
Peter (1 Pet. iii. 1, 5; 2 Pet. ii. 16, 22, etc.). 


Virtue. See on 1 Pet. ii. 9. Used by Peter only, with the 
exception of Philip. iv. 8. The original classical sense of the 
word had no special moral import, but denoted excellence of 
any kind—bravery, rank, nobility ; also, excellence of land, ani- 
mals, things, classes of persons. Paul seems to avoid the term, 
using it only once. 

On glory and virtue Bengel says, “the former indicates his 
natural, the latter his moral, attributes.” 


4. Whereby (6? dv). Lit., through which; viz., his glory 


678 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. L 


and virtue. Note the three occurrences of 8:4, through, in vv. 
3, 4. 


Are given (SeSapnrat). Middle voice ; not passive, as A. V. 
Hence Rev., correctly, he hath granted. See on ver. 3. 


Exceeding great and precious promises. Rev., his ex- 
ceeding great, etc., by way of rendering the definite article, ra. 


Precious (risa). The word occurs fourteen times in the 
New Testament. In eight instances it is used of material things, 
as stones, fruit, wood. In Peter it occurs three times: 1 Pet.1. 
7, of tried faith; 1 Pet. 1.19, of the blood of Christ ; and here, 
of God’s promises. 


Promises (ézrayyéAuata). Only in this epistle. In classical 
Greek the distinction is made between ézayyéApata, promises 
voluntarily or spontaneously made, and trocyéoes, promises 
made in response to a petition. 


Might be partakers (yévyo9e Kowwvoi). Rey., more cor- 
rectly, may become, conveying the idea of a growth. See note 
on xoweves, partaker, 1 Pet. v. 1; and compare Heb. xii. 10. 


Having escaped (azroguyovres). Only in this epistle. To 
escape by flight. 


Through lust (év éi9uuia). Rev. renders by lust, as the 
instrument of the corruption. Others, zn lust, as the sphere of 
the corruption, or as that in which it is grounded. 


5. Beside this (avt0 rodro). Wrong. Render, for this very 
cause, as Rev. Lit., thes very thing. Just as rl, what? has 
come to mean why? So the strengthened demonstrative ac- 
quires the meaning of wherefore, for this very cause. 


Giving all diligence (c7ovdnv wacay trapewevéyxavtes). 
The verb occurs only here in New Testament, and means, liter- 


Cu. I.] THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 679 


ally, to bring in by the side of: adding your diligence to the 
divine promises. So Rev., adding on your part. 


Add to your faith, etc. The A.V. is entirely wrong. The 
verb rendered add (émuxopnyjcate) is derived from yopos, a 
chorus, such as was employed in the representation of the Greek 
tragedies. The verb originally means to bear the expense of a 
chorus, which was done by a person selected by the state, who 
was obliged to defray all the expenses of training and mainten- 
ance. In the New Testament the word has lost this technical 
sense, and is used in the general sense of supplying or provid- 
ing. The verb is used by Paul (2 Cor. ix. 10; Gal. iii. 5; Col. 
ii. 19), and is rendered minister (A. V.), supply (Rev.); and 
the simple verb yopnyéw, minister, occurs 1 Pet. iv. 11; 2 Cor. 
ix. 10. Here the Rev., properly, renders supply. 


To your faith (év 79 lores). The A. V. exhorts to add one 
virtue to another; but the Greek, to develop one virtue i the 
eaercise of another: “an increase by growth, not by external 
junction; each new grace springing out of, attempting, and 
perfecting the other.” Render, therefore, as Rev. In your 
faith supply virtue, and in your virtue knowledge, etc. 


Virtue. See on ver. 3, and 1 Pet. ii. 9. Not in the sense 
of moral excellence, but of the energy which Christians are to 
exhibit, as God exerts his energy upon them. As God calls us 
by his own virtue (ver. 3), so Christians are to exhibit virtue or 
energy in the exercise of their faith, translating it into vigorous 
action. 


6. Temperance (éyxpare/a). Self-control ; holding the pas- 
sions and desires in hand. See 1 Cor. ix. 25. 


Patience (i7opovjv). Lit., remaining behind or staying, 
from pévea, to wait. Not merely endurance of the inevitable, 
for Christ could have relieved himself of his sufferings (Ileb. 
xii. 2, 3; compare Matt. xxvi. 53); but the heroic, brave 
patience with which a Christian not only bears but contends. 


680 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. L 


Speaking of Christ’s patience, Barrow remarks, ‘“‘ Neither was it 
out of a stupid insensibility or stubborn resolution that he did 
thus behave himself; for he had a most vigorous sense of all 
those grievances, and a strong (natural) aversation from under- 
going them; . . . but from a perfect submission to the 
divine will, and entire command over his passions, an excessive 
charity toward mankind, this patient and meek behavior did 
spring.” The same writer defines patience as follows: ‘“ That 
virtue which qualifieth us to bear all conditions and all events, 
by God’s disposal incident to us, with such apprehensions and 
persuasions of mind, such dispositions and affections of heart, 
such external deportment and practices of life as God requireth 
and good reason directeth (Sermon XLIL., “On Patience ”). 


Godliness. See onver. 3. The quality is never ascribed to 
God. 


Brotherly kindness (¢:Aadergpiav). Rev. renders, literally, 
love of the brethren. 


Charity (aydmnv). There seems at first an infelicity in 
the rendering of the Rev., an your love of the brethren love. 
But this is only apparent. In the former word Peter contem- 
plates Christian fellow-believers as naturally and properly hold- 
ing the first place in our affections (compare Gal. vi. 10, 
“ Especrally unto them which are of the household of faith”). 
But he follows this with the broader affection which should 
characterize Christians, and which Paul lauds in 1 Cor. xiii., the 
love of men as men. It may be remarked here that the entire 
rejection by the Rev. of charity as the rendering of dydrn is 
wholesome and defensible. Charity has acquired two peculiar 
meanings, both of which are indeed included or implied in Jove, 
but neither of which expresses more than a single phase of love 
—tolerance and beneficence. The A. V. in the great majority 
of cases translates dove; always in the Gospels, and mostly else- 
where. Thereis no more reason for saying “ charity suffereth 
long,” than for saying, “the chartty of God is shed abroad in 
our hearts,” or “ God is charity.” 


Cu. I.] THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 681 


8. Be in you (u7dpyovta). Rev., are yours; following the 
sense of possesston which legitimately belongs to the verb; as 
Matt. xix. 21, that thow hast; 1 Cor. xiii. 3, goods. In the 
sense of beng the verb is stronger than the simple eivaz, to be ; 
denoting being which is from the beginning, and therefore 
attaching to a person as a proper characteristic; something be- 
longing to him, and so running into the idea of rightful posses- 
sion as above. 


Barren (dpyovs). From a, not, and épyov, work. Hence, 
more correctly, as Rev., zdle. Compare “dle word” (Matt. xii. 
36); “standing zdle” (Matt. xx. 3, 6); also, 1 Tim. v. 13. The 
tautology, barren and unfruitful, is thus avoided. 


In the knowledge (eis). Rev., more correctly, wnto. The 
idea is not idleness in the knowledge, but idleness in pressing 
on and developing toward and finally reaching the knowledge. 
With this agrees the compound ésiyvwour, the constantly m- 
creasing and finally full knowledge. 


9. But (yap). Wrong. Render as Rev., for. 


He that lacketh these things (6 wi) mdpeotw Taira). Lit., 
to whom these things are not present. Note that a different 
word is used here from that in ver. 8, ave yours, to convey the 
idea of possession. Instead of speaking of the gifts as belong- 
ing to the Christian by habitual, settled possession, he denotes 
them now as merely present with him. 


Blind (rugdAds). Illustrating Peter’s emphasis on sight as a 
medium of instruction. See Introduction. 


And cannot see afar off (uvordfwv). Only here in New 
Testament. From pita, to close, and dp, the eye. Closing or 
contracting the eyes like short-sighted people. Hence, to be 
short-sighted. The participle being short-sighted is added to the 
adjective bind, defining it; as if he had said, as blind, that is, 
short-sighted spiritually ; seeing only things present and not 


682 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. I. 


heavenly things. Compare John ix. 41. Rev. renders, seeing 
only what ws near. 


And hath forgotten (AjInv AaBwv). Lit., having taken 
forgetfulness. A unique expression, the noun occurring only 
here in the New Testament. Compare a similar phrase, 2 Tim. 
1.5, dmouvnow AaBov, having taken remembrance: A. V., when 
T call to remembrance: Rev., having been reminded of. Some 
expositors find in the expression a suggestion of a voluntary 
acceptunce of a darkened condition. This is doubtful, however. 
Lumby thinks that it marks the advanced years of the writer, 
since he adds to failure of sight the failure of memory, that fac- 
ulty on which the aged dwell more than on sight. 


That he was purged (rod xaJapicpov). Rev., more liter- 
ally, the cleansing. 


10. The rather (uaArov). The adverb belongs rather with 
the verb give diligence. Render, as Rev., gwe the more diligence. 


Brethren (adcAd¢ol). The only instance of this form of ad- 
dress in Peter, who commonly uses beloved. 


Fall (rratonre). Lit., stwmble, and so Rev. Compare Jas. 
dite 


11. Shall be ministered abundantly (zrovclws éruyopnyn- 
Snoerat). On the verb see ver. 5. Rev., shall be richly sup- 
plied. We are to furnish in our faith: the reward shall be 
furnished unto us. /?echly, indicating the fulness of future 
blessedness. Professor Salmond observes that it is the reverse 
of “‘ saved, yet so as by fire ” (1 Cor. iii. 15). 


Everlasting kingdom (ai@vov Bacirelav). In the first epis- 
tle, Peter designated the believer’s future as an inheritance ; 
here he calls it a kingdom. Hternal, as Rev., is better than 
everlastong, since the word includes more than duration of time. 


Cu. L] THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 683 


12. I will not be negligent. The A. V. follows the read- 
ing od« dyednoo, which it renders correctly. The better read- 
ing, however, is wedAAnow, J intend, or, as often in classical 
Greek, with a sense of certainty—I shall be sure, which Rev. 
adopts, rendering J shall be ready. The formula occurs in but 
one other passage, Matt. xxiv. 6, where it is translated by the 
simple future, ye shall hear, with an implied sense, as ye surely 
wil hear. 


Ye know (eidoras). Lit., knowing. Compare 1 Pet. i. 18. 


Established (éornpryyévous). See on 1 Pet. v.10. Perhaps 
the exhortation, “ strengthen thy brethren,” may account for his 
repeated use of this word and its derivatives. Thus, unstable 
(aarnpixtot) ; steadfastness (atnpryod), 2 Pet. iii. 16, 17. 


In the present truth (ev 77 mapotcn ddndeia). Le., the 
truth which is present with you through the instruction of your 
teachers ; not the truth at present under consideration. See on 
ver. 9; and compare the same phrase in Col. i. 6, rendered, 2s 
come unto you. 


13. Tabernacle (cxnvepate). A figurative expression for 
the body, used also by Paul, 2 Cor. v. 1, 4, though he employs 
the shorter kindred word oxjvos. Peter also has the same 
mixture of metaphors which Paul employs in that passage, viz., 
building and clothing. See next verse. Peter’s use of taber- 
nacle is significant in connection with his words at the trans- 
figuration, “Let us make three tabernacles (Matt. xvii. 4). 
The word, as well as the entire phrase, carries the idea of brief 
duration—a frail tent, erected for a night. Compare ver. 14. 


To stir you up by putting you in remembrance (ée- 
yetpew buds év vrropvncer). Lit., to stir you up in reminding. 
See the same phrase in ch. iii. 1. 


14. Shortly | must put off this my tabernacle (tayw7 
éotw 7 amTodects TOV cKnVewaTOSs ov). Lit., guick is the put- 


684 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. L 


ting off of my tabernacle. Rev., the putting off of my taber- 
nacle cometh swiftly. Possibly in allusion to his advanced age. 
Putting off is a metaphor, from putting off a garment. So 
Paul, 2 Cor. v. 3,4, being clothed, wnclothed, clothed upon. The 
word occurs, also, 1 Pet. iii. 21, and is used by Peter only. 
Cometh swiftly, implying the speedy approach of death ; though 
others understand it of the quick, violent death which Christ 
prophesied he should die. ‘Even as our Lord Jesus Christ 
hath showed me.” See John xxi. 18,19. Compare, also, John 
xiii. 36, and note the word follow in both passages. “ Peter 
had now learnt the full force of Christ’s sayings, and to what 
end the following of Jesus was to bring him ” (Lumby). 


Hath shewed (éd7A@cev). But the tense is the aorist, point- 
ing back to a definite act at a past time (John xxi.18). Hence, 
shewed me, or, as Rev., signified. Compare 1 Pet. i. 11, did 


signify. 


15. Ye may be able (éyew tas). Lit., that you may have 
at. A similar use of have, in the sense of to be able, occurs 
Mark xiv. 8. The same meaning is also foreshadowed in Matt. 
xviii. 25, had not to pay ; and John viii. 6, have to accuse. 


Decease (éo0d0v). Hxodus is a literal transcript of the word, 
and is the term used by Luke in his account of the transfigura- 
tion. ‘ They spake of his decease.” It occurs only once else- 
where, Heb. xi. 22, in the literal sense, the departing or exodus 
of the children of Israel. “It is at least remarkable,” says 
Dean Alford, “that, with the recollection of the scene on the 
mount of transfiguration floating in his mind, the apostle should 
use so close together the words which were there also associated, 
tabernacle and decease. The coincidence should not be for- 
gotten in treating of the question of the genuineness of the 
epistle.” 


Call to remembrance (uvjunv croveto Sar). The phrase oc- 
curs nowhere else in the New Testament. In classical Greek, to 
make mention of. An analogous expression is found, Rom. i. 


Ca. 1.) THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 685 


9, uvelav rrovovpat, I make mention. See, also, Eph. i. 16; 1 
Thess. i. 2; Philem. 4. Some render it thus here, as express- 
ing Peter’s desire to make it possible for his readers to report 
these things to others. Rev., to call these things to remem- 
brance. 


16. We have not followed (ov éEaxonovIjcavtes). A strong 
compound, used only here and ch. ii. 2,15. The e& gives the 
force of following out ; in pursuance of ; closely. 


Cunningly devised (cecogicpévors). Only here and 2 Tim. 
iii. 15, in which latter passage it has a good sense, to make thee 
wise. Here, in a bad sense, artfully framed by human clever- 
ness (copia). Compare feigned words, ch. ii. 3. 


Fables (uvJos). This word, which occurs only here and in 
the Pastoral Epistles, is transcribed in the word myth. The 
reference here may be to the Jewish myths, rabbinical embel- 
lishments of Old-Testament history; or to the heathen myths 
about the descent of the gods to earth, which might be sug- 
gested by his remembrance of the transfiguration; or to the 
Gnostic speculations about aeons or emanations, which rose from 
the eternal abyss, the source of all spiritual existence, and were 
named Mind, Wisdom, Power, Truth, ete. 


Coming (aapovalav). Or presence. Compare ch. ili. 4. 
Another word, droxdduis, revelation, is used in 1 Pet. i. 7, 
13; iv. 18, to describe the appearing of Christ. 


Eye-witnesses (éromrau). See on behold, 1 Pet. ii. 12. Only 
here in New Testament. Compare the different word in Luke 
i. 2, adtomras, eye-wiinesses. 


Majesty (ueyadevornT0s). Used in only two passages besides 
this: Luke ix. 43, of the mighty power (Rev., majesty) of God, 
as manifested in the healing of the epileptic child; and Acts 
xix. 27, of the magnificence of Diana. 


686 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cx. I 


17. When there came (éveydelons). Lit. having been 
borne. Compare come (Rev., ver. 18); moved (ver. 21); and 
rushing wind, lit., a wind borne along (Acts il. 2). 


From (v7o0). Lit., by. 


Excellent (ueyadorperots). Or sublime. Only here in 
New Testament. In Septuagint (Deut. xxiii. 26), as an epithet 
of God, excellency. The phrase excellent glory refers to the 
bright cloud which overshadowed the company on the transfig- 
uration mount, like the shekinah above the mercy-seat. 


18. Voice (fwviv). Note the same word in the account of 
Pentecost (Acts. ii. 6), where the A. V. obscures the meaning by 
rendering, when this was noised abroad ; whereas it should be 
when this voice was heard. 


Which came (éveyJeicav). Lit., having been borne. See on 
ver. 17. Rev., This voice we ourselves (jets, we, emphatic) 
heard come (better, borne) out of heaven. 


Holy mount. It is scarcely necessary to notice Davidson’s 
remark that this expression points to a time when superstitious 
reverence for places had sprung up in Palestine. “ Of all places 
to which special sanctity would be ascribed by Christ’s follow- 
ers, surely that would be the first to be so marked where the 
most solemn testimony was given to the divinity of Jesus. To 
the Jewish Christian this would rank with Sinai, and no name 
would be more fitly applied to it than that which had so con- 
stantly been given to a place on which God first revealed him- 
self in his glory. The ‘holy mount of God’ (Ezek. xxvii. 14) 
would now receive another application, and he would see little 
of the true continuity of God’s revelation who did not connect 
readily the old and the new covenants, and give to the place 
where the glory of Christ was most eminently shown forth the 
same name which was applied so oft to Sinai” (Lumby). 


19. We have also a more sure word of prophecy (xai 
éyouev BeBarorepov Tov rpodytixov Noyov). The A. V is wrong, 


Cu. 1] THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 687 


since more sure is used predicatively, and word has the definite 
article. We may explain either (a) as Rev., we have the word 
of prophecy made more sure, i.e., we are better certified than 
before as to the prophetic word by reason of this voice; or (0) 
we have the word of prophecy as a surer confirmation of God’s 
truth than what we ourselves saw, 2.¢., Old-Testament testi- 
mony is more convincing than even the voice heard at the 
transfiguration. The latter seems to accord better with the 
words which follow. ‘To appreciate this we must put our- 
selves somewhat in the place of those for whom St. Peter wrote. 
The New Testament, as we have it, was to them non-exist- 
ent. Therefore we can readily understand how the long line 
of prophetic scriptures, fulfilled in so many ways in the life of 
Jesus, would be a mightier form of evidence than the narrative 
of one single event in Peter’s life” (Lumby). “Peter knew a 
sounder basis for faith than that of signs and wonders. He 
had seen our Lord Jesus Christ receive honor and glory from 
God the Father in the holy mount; he had been dazzled and 
carried out of himself by visions and voices from heaven ; but, 
nevertheless, even when his memory and heart are throbbing 
with recollections of that sublime scene, he says, ‘we have 
something surer still in the prophetic word” . . . It was 
not the miracles of Christ by which he came to know Jesus, but 
the word of Christ as interpreted by the spirit of Christ” (Sam- 
uel Cox). 


Unto a light (Avyvw). More correctly, as Rev., a damp. 


In a dark place (év advyynpe tor). A peculiar expression. 
Lit., a dry place. Only here in New Testament. Rev. gives 
squalid, in margin. Aristotle opposes it to bright or glistering. 
It is a subtle association of the idea of darkness with squalor, 
dryness, and general neglect. 


Dawn (Svavydon). Only here in New Testament. Compare 
the different word in Matt. xxviii. 1, and Luke xxiii. 54, ésr- 
gockeo. The verb is compounded of did, through, and avyn, 
sunlight, thus carrying the picture of light breaking through the- 
gloom. 


688 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. IL. 


The day-star (bwaddpos). Of which our word phosphorus 
is a transcript. Lit., Léght-bearer, like Lucifer, from lua, light,

20. Is (ytveras). More literally, arises or originates. 


Private (iSéas). See on ver. 3. His own. Rev., speczal, in 
margin. 


Interpretation (érAvcews). Only here in New Testament. 
Compare the cognate verb expounded (Mark iv. 34) and deter- 
mined (Acts xix. 39). The usual word is épunveia (1 Cor. xii. 
10; xiv. 26). Literally, it means loosening, wntying, as of hard 
knots of scripture. 


21. Came (jvéyIn). Lit., was borne or brought. See on vv. 
17, 18 


Holy men of God (dytor Jeod advIpwror). The best texts 
omit holy, and read amo Jeod, from God. Render, as Rev., 
men spake from God. 


Moved (depduevor). The same verb as came. Lit., being 
borne along. It seems to be a favorite word with Peter, occur- 
ring six times in the two epistles. 


CHAT JIB LL:

and Jude (ver. 4) as present.

tament.

Privily shall bring in (aapecod£ovow). Only here in New 
Testament. The kindred adjective occurs Gal. ii. 4, “false 
brethren privily brought in” (aapevcdxtovs). The metaphor 
is of spzes or tractors introducing themselves into an enemy’s 
camp. Compare Jude 4, crept in unawares. The verb means, 
literally, to bring (a@yew) into (eis) by the side of (apa). 


Damnable heresies (aipécess amwnelas). Lit., heresres of 
destruction. Rev., destructive heresies. Heresy is a transcript 
of aipeocs, the primary meaning of which is chovce; so that 
a heresy is, strictly, the choice of an opinion contrary to that 
usually received; thence transferred to the body of those who 
profess such opinions, and therefore a sect. So Reyv., in margin, 
sects of perdition. Commonly in this sense in the New Testa- 
ment (Acts v.17; xv.53; xxviii. 22), though the Rev. has an odd 
variety in its marginal renderings. See Acts. xxiv. 14; 1 Cor. 
xi. 19; Gal. v.20. The rendering heretical doctrines seems to 
agree better with the context; false teachers bringing in sects is 
awkward. 


Denying. A significant word from Peter. 


The Lord (Sec7d7nv). In most cases in the New Testament 
the word is rendered master, the Rev. changing lord to master 
in every case but two—Luke ii. 29; Acts iv. 24; and in both in- 
stances putting master in margin, and reserving lord for the 
rendering of «vpsos. In three of these instances the word is 
used in direct address to God; and it may be asked why the 
Rev. changes Lord to Master in the text of Apoc. vi. 10, and re- 
tains Lord in Luke ii. 29; Acts iv. 24. In five out of the ten 
occurrences of the word in the New Testament it means master 
of the household. Originally, it indicates absolute, unrestricted 
authority, so that the Greeks refused the title to any but the 
gods. In the New Testament deomdrns and xvpios are used in- 
terchangeably of God, and of masters of servants.

sented as a living thing, awake and expectant. Long ago that 
judgment started on its destroying path, and the fate of sinning 
angels, and the deluge, and the overthrow of Sodom and Gomor- 
rah were but incidental illustrations of its power; nor has it

Cast them down to hell (taptapwcas). Only here in New

Peter using this Pagan term, which represents the Greek hell, 
though treated here not as equivalent to Gehenna, but as the 
place of detention until the judgment. 


Chains of darkness (cevpais Sopov). eupd is a cord or 
band, sometimes of metal. Compare Septuagint, Prov. v. 22; 
Wisd. of Sol. xvii. 2,18. The best texts, however, substitute 
atpois or ceipois, pits or caverns. pds originally is a place 
for storing corn. Rev., pits of darkness. 


Of darkness (fogov). Peculiar to Peter and Jude. Origi- 
nally of the gloom of the nether world, So Homer:

A preacher («ypuxa). Lit., a herald. Compare the kin-

The word herald is beautifully suggestive, at many points, of 
the office of a gospel minister. In the Homeric age the herald 
partook of the character of an ambassador. He summoned the 
assembly and kept order in it, and had charge of arrangements 
at sacrifices and festivals. The office of the heralds was sacred, 
and their persons inviolable ; hence they were employed to bear 
messages between enemies. The symbol of their office was the 
herald’s staff, or caduceus, borne by Mercury, the herald-god. 
This was originally an olive-branch with fillets, which were 
afterward formed into snakes, according to the legend that 
Mercury found two snakes fighting and separated them with his 
wand, from which circumstance they were used as an emblem of 
peace. Plato (“ Laws,” xii., 941) thus speaks of the fidelity 


Cu. IL} THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 693 


entailed by the office: “If any herald or ambassador carry a 
false message to any other city, or bring back a false message 
from the city to which he is sent, or be proved to have brought 
back, whether from friends or enemies, in his capacity of herald 
or ambassador, what they have never said—let him be indicted 
for having offended, contrary to the law, in the sacred office 
and appointment of Hermes and Zeus, and let there be a pen- 
alty fixed which he shall suffer or pay if he be convicted.” In 
later times, their position as messengers between nations at war 
wasemphasized. In Herodotus (i., 21), the word herald is used 
as synonymous with apostle. ‘“ Alyattes sent a herald (xnpuxa) 
to Miletus in hopes of concluding a truce, etc. The herald 
(aréaronos) went on his way to Miletus.” A priestly house at 
Athens bore the name of «ypuxes, heralds. 


Bringing in (érd£as). The verb may be said to be used by 
Peter only. Besides this passage and ver. 1, it occurs only at 
Acts vy. 28, where Luke probably received the account from 
Peter as the principal actor: “ye intend to bring upon us 
(érrayaryeiv) this man’s blood.” 


6. Turning into ashes (redpdcas). Only here in New 
Testament. 


Having made them an example (iddeypa TEJELKOS). 
Compare 1 Pet. ii. 21. The word for ewample is condemned as 
unclassical by the Attic grammarians, and wapadevypa is substi- 
tuted, which means, properly, @ sculptor’s or a painter's model, 
or an architect's plan. 


7. Just (Sixavoy). Occurring three times in wv. 7, 8. 


Vexed (xatarovotpevov). Only here and Acts vii. 24. Kara 
gives the force of worn down. So Rev., sore distressed. 


With the filthy conversation of the wicked (imo THs TOV 
iXécuwv ev aceryela avactpopis). Lit., by the behavior of the 
lawless in wantonness. Rev., the lascivious life of the wicked.

Life or behavior (avaotpopis). See on 1 Pet. i. 15. Wicked 
(a9écpor), lit., lawless. Only here and ch. iii. 17. Wanton- 
ness (acedyeia), see on Mark vii. 22. 


8. Dwelling (éyxcatoxov). Only here in New Testament. 
Dwelling, and therefore suffering continually, from day to day. 


In seeing (@dXéupare). Only here in New Testament. Usu- 
ally of the look of a man from wethout, through which the 
vexation comes to the soul. “ Vexed his righteous sow/.” 


Vexed (éBacavifev). See on Matt. iv. 24, torments. The 
original sense is to test by touchstone or by torture. See on 
toiling, Mark vi. 48. Rev. gives tormented, in margin. 


Unlawful (avouors). Rev., dawless. Only here in New Tes- 
tament with ¢héngs. In all other cases it is applied to persons. 


9. Godly (edceBeis). Used by Peter only. Compare Acts 
x. 2,7. The reading at Acts xxii. 12, is evAaBys, devout. See 
on ch. i. 3. 


Temptation (aepacyod). See on 1 Pet. i. 6. 


To reserve (rnpetv). See onl Pet.i. 4. Rev., keep, is not 
an improvement. 


To be punished (xorafouévous). Only here and Acts iv. 
21, where the narrative probably came from Peter. The par- 
ticiple here is, lit., being punished, and therefore the A. V. is 
wrong. Rev., rightly, wnder punishment. Compare Matt. 
xxv. 46. 


10. Go after the flesh. Compare Jude 7. 


Of uncleanness (yacpod). Only here in New Testament. 
See on defilements, ver. 20. Compare Jude 8. 


Despise government. Rev., dominion. Compare Jude 8,

Presumptuous (roAyyrtal). Only here in New Testament. 
Lit., darers. Rev., darmg. 


Self-willed (avId8eus). Only here and Tit.i. 7. From adros, 
self, and #douar, to delight in. Therefore a self-loving spirit. 


They tremble (tpguovew). Compare Mark v. 33. An un- 
common word in the New Testament. Luke viii. 47; Acts 
ix.G: 


Dignities (Sofas). Lit., glories. Compare Jude 8. Prob- 
ably angelic powers: note the reference to the angels imme- 
diately following, as in Jude 9 to Michael. They defy the 
spiritual powers though knowing their might. 


11. Power and might (doyvi cai duvdper). Rev., might and 
power. The radical idea of toys, might, is that of indwelling 
strength, especially as embodied : might which inheres in phys- 
ical powers organized and working under individual direction, 
as an army: which appears in the resistance of physical organ- 
isms, as the earth, against which one dashes himself in vain: 
which dwells in persons or things, and gives them influence or 
value: which resides in laws or punishments to make them irre- 
sistible. This sense comes out clearly in the New Testament 
in the use of the word and of its cognates. Thus, “ Love the 
Lord thy God with all thy strength” (Mark xii. 30): “accord- 
ing to the working of his mighty power” (Eph. i. 19). So the 
kindred adjective loyupds. “A strong man” (Matt. xii. 29): 
a mighty famine (Luke xv. 14): his letters are powerful (2 
Cor. x. 10): a strong consolation (Heb. vi. 18): a maghty angel 
(Apoe. xviii. 21). Also the verb isxvo. “It is good for noth- 
ing” (Matt. v.13): “shall not be able” (Luke xiii. 24): “I can 
do all things” (Philip. iv. 18): “availeth much” (Jas. v. 16). 

Abvapus is rather ability, faculty : not necessarily manifest, as 
icyvs: power residing in one by nature. Thus ability (Matt. 
xxv. 15): virtue (Mark v. 30): power (Luke xxiv. 29; Acts i. 
8; 1 Cor. ii. 4): “ strength of sin” (1 Cor. xv. 56). So of moral 
vigor. “Strengthened with might in the imner man” (Eph. 


696 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IL 


iii. 16): “with all méght (Col. i. 11). It is, however, mostly 
power % action, as in the frequent use of duvdpers for miracles, 
mighty works, they being exhibitions of divine virtue. Thus 
“power unto salvation ” (Rom. i. 16): the kingdom coming zn 
power” (Mark ix. 1): God himself called power—* the right 
hand of the power” (Matt. xxvi. 64), and so in classical Greek 
used to denote the magistrates or authorities. Also of the 
angelic powers (Eph. i. 21; Rom. viii. 38 ; 1 Pet. iii. 22). Gen- 
erally, then, it may be said that while both words include the 
idea of manifestation or of power in action, ‘oxvs emphasizes 
the outward, physical manifestations, and dvvapus the enward, 
spiritual or moral virtue. Plato (“ Protagoras,” 350) draws the 
distinction thus: “I should not have admitted that the able 
(Suvarovs) are strong (iaxvpods), though I have admitted that 
the strong are able. For there is a difference between abzlety 
(Sdvamwv) and strength (tcxvv). The former is given by knowl- 
edge as well as by madness or rage; but strength comes from 
nature and a healthy state of the body. Aristotle (“ Rhet.,” i., 
5) says “ strength (ioxds) is the power of moving another as one 
wills; and that other is to be moved either by drawing or push- 
ing or carrying or pressing or compressing; so that the strong 
(6 toyupos) is strong for all or for some of these things.” 


Railing judgment. Compare Jude 9; Zech. iii. 1, 2. 


12. As natural brute beasts made to be taken and de- 
stroyed. This massing of epithets is characteristic of Peter. 
Natural (pvorxa), Rev., mere animals, should be construed 
with made, or as Rev., born (yeyevvnuéva). Brute (aroya), lit., 
unreasoning or irrational. Rev., without reason. Compare 
Acts xxv. 27. Beasts (f@a). Lit., wing creatures, from fda, 
to live. More general and inclusive than beasts, since it denotes 
strictly all creatures that live, including man. Plato even ap- 
plies it to God himself. Hence Rev., properly, creatures. To 
be taken and destroyed (eis Ghoow kal d3opav). Lit., for capture 
and destruction. Destruction twice in this verse, and with a 
cognate verb. Render the whole, as Rev., But these, as creatures 
without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed. 


Cx. 123 THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 697 


Speak evil (@racdnuodvres). Participle. Rev., rightly, raz 
wg. Compare vv. 10, 11. 


And shall utterly perish in their own corruption (év 77 
bIopa avtav Kail PIapyjcovra). ‘There isa play upon the words, 
which the Rey. reproduces by rendering, “ shall in their destroy- 
ing surely be destroyed.” The and, which in the A. V. connects 
this and the preceding sentence, is rather to be taken with shadd 
be destroyed, as emphasizing it, and should be rendered, as Rev., 
surely, or as others, even or also. Compare on the whole verse 
Jude 10. 


13. And shall receive (cousodpevor). Lit., being about or 
destined to receive. See on 1 Pet. i. 9, and compare 1 Pet. v. 
4. Some good texts read doduxovpevor, suffering wrong. So 
Rev., suffering wrong as the hire of wrong-doing. 


Reward of unrighteousness (usc9ov abdixias). Mics is 
hire, and so is rendered in Rey. Compare Matt. xx. 8; Luke 
x. 7; John iv. 36. It also has in classical Greek the general 
sense of reward, and so very often in the New Testament, in 
passages where hire or wages would be inappropriate. Thus 
Matt. v.12; vi. 1; x.41. Hire would seem to be better here, 
because of the reference to Balaam in ver. 15, where the word 
occurs again and requires that rendering. The phrase prodds 
abixias, reward or wages of iniquity, occurs only here and in 
Peter’s speech concerning Judas (Acts i. 18), where the Rev. 
retains the rendering of the A. V., reward of iniquity. It 
would have been better to render wages of imiguity in both 
places. Iniquity and unrighteousness are used in English 
almost synonymously ; though, etymologically, oequity empha- 
sizes the idea of injustice (inaequus), while unrighteousness 
(non-rightness) is more general, implying al deviation from 
right, whether involving another’s interests or not. This dis- 
tinction is not, however, observed in the Rev., where the render- 
ing of adcxia, and of the kindred adjective sien varies unac- 
countably, if not capriciously, between unrighteous and wnjust. 


698 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IL 


As they that count it pleasure to riot (jSovjy syovpevor 
tpudiv). The as of the A.V. is needless. The discourse pro- 
ceeds from ver. 18 by a series of participles, as far as following 
(ver. 15). Literally the passage runs, cownting riot a pleasure. 


Riot (rpud7jv). Meaning rather daintiness, delicacy, lwau- 
riousness. Even the Rev. revel is almost too strong. Compare 
Luke vii. 25, the only other passage where the word occurs, and 
where the Rev. retains the A. V., live delicately. So, also, Rev. 
substitutes, in Jas. v. 5, lived delicately for lived in pleasure. 


In the daytime. Compare Peter’s words Acts ii. 15; also, 1 
Thess. v. 7. 


Spots (o7/Ao1). Only here and Eph. v. 27. Compare the 
kindred participle spotted (Jude 23), and defileth (Jas. ili. 6). 


Blemishes (wapor). Only here in New Testament. The 
negatives of the two terms spots and blemzshes occur at 1 Pet. 
i419: 


Sporting themselves (évtpufa@vtes). From tpudy, luau- 
riousness. See on riot. Rev., revelling. 


With their own deceivings (év tals amdtais avtav). The 
Rey., however, follows another reading, which occurs in the 
parallel passage Jude 12: aydraus, love-feasts, the public ban- 
quets instituted by the early Christians, and connected with the 
celebration of the Lord’s Supper. Rev. renders revelling in 
their love-feasts, though the American Committee insist on de- 
ceivings. On the abuses at these feasts, see 1 Cor. xi. 20-22. 
For avrév, their own, the best texts read adrav, their. 


While they feast with you (cuvevwyovpevor). The word 
originally conveys the idea of swmptuous feasting, and is ap- 
propriate in view of the fact to which Peter alludes, that these 
sensualists converted the love-feast into a revel. Compare 
Paul’s words, 1 Cor. xi. 21, “one is hungry and another

drunken.” This seems to favor the reading aydrais. The 
word occurs only here and Jude 12. 


14. Eyes. Another illustration of Peter’s emphasis on seght. 
It is the instrument of evil no less than of good. Compare 
Matt. v. 28. 


Adultery (uovyardidos). Lit., an adulteress, but used as an 
adjective Matt. xii. 39; xvi. 4. 


That cannot cease (dxataravcrous). Only here, in New 
Testament. Compare hath ceased (1 Pet. iv. 1). 


Beguiling (Sededfovres). Only here, ver. 18, and Jas. i. 14. 
From 6édeap, @ bait. An appropriate word from Peter the 
fisherman. Rev., enticing. 


Unstable (acrnpixrous). A compound of the word at 1 Pet. 
vy. 10, stablish. See note there, and on 2 Pet. i. 12. 


An heart they have exercised (xapdiav ryeyupvac weéevny 
éyovtes). The A. V. is awkward. Better, Rev., having @ 
heart exercised. Exercised is the word used for gymnastic 
training, from which gymnastic is derived. 


With covetous practices. The A. V. follows the old read- 
ing, wAeoveE(ats. The best texts read mreoveelas, covetousness. 
Rev., therefore, rightly, 7 covetousness. 


Cursed children (xardpas réxva). Lit., children of cursing; 
and so Rev. See on Mark iii. 17, and 1 Pet. i. 14. 


15. Right (ed9ezav). Lit., straight, which is the radical 
meaning of right. 


Are gone astray (é7Aav7jIncav). See on Mark xii. 24. 


Following (é£axorovSjcavres). See on ch. i. 16; ii. 2. Com:

The way. Note the frequent occurrence of the word way 
in the story of Balaam (Num. xxii.), and Peter’s use of the 
same phrase, as here, the right ways of the Lord, in Acts xii. 10. 


Bosor. Rev. gives Beor, the Old Testament form of the 
name. 


Wages of unrighteousness. See on ver. 13. 


16. Was rebuked (rey éoyev). Lit. hadarebuke. The 
word for rebuke only here in New Testament. 


For his iniquity (¢8/as mapavoylas). Rev., his own trans- 
gression. His own, see on ch.i.3. Transgression, from Tapa, 
contrary to, and vopos, law. Only here in New Testament. 
Compare the kindred verb wrapavoyéw, also occurring but once, 
Acts xxili. 8, where see note on contrary to the law. 


The dumb ass. Inserting an article not in the text, and 
omitted by Rev. 


Ass (irroftyov). Lit., beast of burden. An animal subjected 
to the yoke. From t76, beneath, and fuyov, a yoke. See on 
Matt xxi. 5. 


Speaking (gIeyEduevov). The verb is found in Peter only, 
here and ver. 18, and in Acts iv. 18, a Petrine narrative. It 
is well chosen, however. The verb denotes the utterance of a 
sound or voice, not only by man, but by any animal having 
lungs. Hence, not only of men’s articulate cries, such as a 
battle-shout, but of the neigh of the horse, the scream of the 
eagle, the croak of the raven. It is also applied to sounds 
made by inanimate things, such as thunder, a trumpet, a lyre, 
the ring of an earthen vessel, showing whether it is cracked or 
not. Schmidt (‘“Synonymik”) says that it does not indicate 
any physical capability on the part of the man, but describes the 
sound only from the hearer’s stand-point. In view of this 
general sense of the verb, the propriety is apparent of the de- 
fining phrase, with man’s voice.

Madness (zrapadpoviav). Only here in New Testament. 
But compare the kindred verb rrapadpovéw (2 Cor. xi. 23), in 
the phrase, “J speak as a fool.” From rapa, beside, and dprv, 
the mind ; and so equivalent to the phrase, beside one’s self. 


17. Wells (znyat). Better, as Rev., springs ; yet the Rev. 
has retained wel/ at John iv. 14, where the change would have 
given more vividness to Christ’s metaphor, which is that of an 
ever upleaping, living fountain. 


Without water. As so often in the East, where the verd- 
ure excites the traveller’s hope of water. Compare Jer. ii. 18, 
and the contrast presented in Isa. lviii. 11; Prov. x.11; xiii. 14. 


Clouds. The A. V. has followed the Tex. Rec., vehérau, as 
in Jude 12. The correct reading is éuéyAa, mists, found only 
here in New Testament. So Rev. 


With a tempest (i770 Aairamros). Rev., by a storm. The 
word occurs only twice elsewhere—Mark iv. 37; Luke vii. 23— 
in the parallel accounts of the storm on the lake, which Jesus 
calmed by his word. There on the lake Peter was at home, as 
well as with the Lord on that occasion; and the peculiar word 
describing a whirlwind—one of those sudden storms so frequent 
on that lake (see note on the word, Mark iv. 37)—would be the 
first to occur to him. Compare Paul’s similar figure, Eph. iv. 14. 


Blackness (fogos). See on ver. 4, and compare Jude 13. 


Of darkness (rod oxorovs). Lit., the darkness, denoting a 
well-understood doom. 


Is reserved (terjpntar). Lit., hath been reserved, as Rev.

18. When they speak (fJeyyouevo). Rev., better, wtter-

Great swelling (v7époyca). Only here and Jude 16. The 
word means of excessive bulk. It accords well with the peculiar 
word uttering, since it denotes a kind of speech full of high- 
sounding verbosity without substance. ®Ieyyopevos, uttering, 
is significantly applied alike to Balaam’s beast and to these 
empty declaimers. 


Entice. See ver. 14. 


Were clean escaped. The A. V. follows the Tex. Rec., 
dvTws atopuyovtas ; dvTwas meaning really, actually, as Luke 
xxiv. 84; and the participle being the aorist, and so meaning 
were escaped. But the best texts all read 6Atyws, in @ Little 
degree, or just, or scarcely ; and amodevyovtas, the present par- 
ticiple, are escaping ; and denoting those who are in the early 
stage of their escape from error, and are not safe from it and 
confirmed in the truth. Hence, Rev., correctly, who are just 
escaping. "Ondéiyas, ouly here.

Second—I write. An incidental testimony to the author- 
ship of the second epistle. 


Pure minds (eiduxpwh Sdiavocav). The latter word is sin- 
gular, not plural. Hence, as Rev., mind. ‘The word rendered 
pure is often explained tested by the sunlight ; but this is very 
doubtful, since efA7n, to which this meaning is traced, means the 
heat, and not the ght of the sun. Others derive it from the 
root of the verb eiA/cow, to roll, and explain it as that which is 
separated or sifted by rolling, as in a sieve. In favor of this 
etymology is its association in classical Greek with different 
words meaning wnmixed. The word occurs only here and 
Philip. 1.10. The kindred noun eiduxplvera, sincerity, is found 
1 Cor. v. 8; 2 Cor. i. 12; ii.17. Rev., here, sencere. 


Mind (dvdvovav). Compare 1 Pet.i. 13; and see on Mark 
xii. 30. 


3. Scoffers walking (é€uzaixras mropevopevor). This is the 
reading followed by A. V. But the later texts have added 
éumravypovn, in mockery, occurring only here, though a kindred 
word for mockings (€umavyyov) is found Heb. xi. 36. This

addition gives a play upon the words; and so Rev., “dockers 
shall come with mockery, walking,” etc. 


4. From the beginning of the creation (dm dpyijs xr 
cews). Not acommon phrase. It occurs only Mark x. 6; xiii. 
195 Apocmain. 14. 


Fell asleep (éxouujIncav). A literal and correct translation 
of the word, which occurs frequently in the New Testament, but 
only here in Peter. Some have supposed that the peculiarly 
Christian sense of the word is emphasized zronically by these 
mockers. It is used, however, in classical Greek to denote 
death. The difference between the pagan and the Christian 
usage lies in the fact that, in the latter, it was defined by the 
hope of the resurrection, and therefore was used literally of a 
sleep, which, though long, was to havean awaking. See on Acts 
vii. 60. 


5. This they willingly are ignorant of (Aavddver adtods 
tovto Yédovtas). Lit., thes escapes them of their own will. 
Reyv., this they wilfully forget. 


The heavens were. But the Greek has no article. Ren- 
der, there were heavens. So, too, not the earth, but an earth, 
as Rev. 


Standing (cvvecrdca). Incorrect; for the word is, literally, 
standing together ; i.e., compacted or formed. Compare Col. i. 
17, consist. Rev., compacted. 


Out of the water. Again noarticle. Render owt of water ; 
denoting not the position of the earth, but the material or 
mediating element in the creation ; the waters being gathered 
together in one place, and the dry land appearing. Or, pos- 
sibly, with reference to the original liquid condition of the 
earth—without form and vord. 


ae 


in the water (6¢ ddaros). Omit the article. Ad has its 
usual sense here, not as Rev., amzdst, but by means of. Bengel: 


Cx. Il.) THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 705 


“The water served that the earth should consist.” Expositors 
are much divided as to the meaning. This is the view of 
Huther, Salmond, and, substantially, Alford. 


6. The world that then was (06 rote xoapos). Lit., the then 
world. The word for world is literally order, and denotes the 
perfect system of the material universe. 


Being overflowed (cataxAvaNels). Only here in New Tes- 
tament. Cataclysm is derived from it. 


7. The heavens—which now are (0: viv ovpavol). A con- 
struction similar to the then world (ver. 6). The now heavens, 
or the present heavens. 


Kept in store (teSncavpicpéver). Rev., stored up.  Lit., 
treasured up. The same word which is used in Luke xii. 21, 
layeth up treasure. Sometimes with the kindred noun Iycav- 
povs, treasures, as Matt. vi. 19; lit., treasure treasures. 


Unto fire. Some construe this with treasured up; as Rev., 
stored up for fire ; others with reserved, as A. V.; others again 
give the sense stored with fire, indicating that the agent for the 
final destruction is already prepared. 


9. Is not slack (ov Spadvver). Only here and 1 Tim. iii. 15. 
The word is literally to delay or loiter. So Septuagint, Gen. 
xliii. 10, ‘except we had lingered.” Alford’s rendering, 2s not 
tardy, would be an improvement. The word implies, besides 
delay, the idea of lateness with reference to an appointed time. 


Come (ywpicat). Move on, or advance to. 


10. The day of the Lord. Compare the same phrase in 
Peter’s sermon, Actsii. 20. It occurs only in these two passages 
and 1 Thess. v. 2. See 1 Cor. i. 8; 2 Cor. i. 14.

With a great noise (fovgmSev). An adverb peculiar to Peter, 
and oceurring only here. It is a word in which the sound sug- 
gests the sense (rhoizedon) ; and the kindred noun, potfos, is used 
in classical Greek of the whistling of an arrow; the sound of a 
shepherd’s pipe; the rush of wings ; the plash of water ; the hiss- 
ing of a serpent; and the sound of filing. 


The elements (ctovyeta). Derived from ototyos, a row, 
and meaning originally one of a row or series ; hence a compo- 
nent or element. The name for the letters of the alphabet, as 
being set inrows. Applied to the four elements—fire, air, earth, 
water; and in later times to the planets and signs of the zodiac. 
It is used in an ethical sense in other passages; as in Gal. iv. 3, 
“elements or rudiments of the world.” Also of elementary 
teaching, such as the law, which was fitted for an earlier stage 
in the world’s history ; and of the first principles of religious 
knowledge among men. In Col. ii. 8, of formal ordinances. 
Compare Heb. v. 12. The kindred verb orovyéw, to walk, car- 
ries the idea of keeping in line, according to the radical sense. 
Thus, walk according to rule (Gal. vi. 16); walkest orderly 
(Acts xxi. 24). So, too, the compound ovatovyéw, only in Gal. 
iv. 25, answereth to, lit., belongs to the same row or column with. 
The Greek grammarians called the categories of letters arranged 
according to the organs of speech ovotovyiat. Here the word 
is of course used in a physical sense, meaning the parts of which 
this system of things is composed. Some take it as meaning the 
heavenly bodies, but the term is too late and technical in that 
sense. Compare Matt. xxiv. 29, the powers of the heaven. 


Shall melt (AvIjcovrat). More literally, as Rev., shall be 
dissolved. 


With fervent heat (kavoovpeva). Lit., being scorched up. 


11. To be dissolved (Avoyévwv). So Rev. But the parti- 
ciple is present; and the idea is rather, are in process of disso- 
lution. The world and all therein is essentially transitory.

Godliness (evceSeiars). See on ch. i. 3. Both words are

12. Looking for (zpocdoxavras). The same verb as in Luke 
i. 21, of wating for Zacharias. Cornelius wazted (Acts x. 24) ; 
the cripple expecting to receive something (Acts ili. 5). 


Hasting unto (ozevdovras). Wrong. Rev., earnestly de- 
siring, for which there is authority. Iam inclined to adopt, 
with Alford, Huther, Salmond, and Trench, the transitive mean- 
ing, hastening on; i.e., “causing the day of the Lord to come 
more quickly by helping to fulfil those conditions without which 
it cannot come; that day being no day inexorably fixed, but 
one the arrival of which it is free to the church to hasten on 
by faith and by prayer” (Trench, on “The Authorized Version 
of the New Testament”). See Matt. xxiv. 14: the gospel shall 
be preached in the whole world, “and ¢hen shall the end come.” 
Compare the words of Peter, Acts iii. 19: “Repent and be 
converted,” etc., “that so there may come seasons of refreshing ” 
(so Rev., rightly) ; and the prayer, “ Thy kingdom come.” Sal- 
mond quotes a rabbinical saying, “If thou keepest this precept 
thou hastenest the day of Messiah.” This meaning is given in 
margin of Rey.

Of these, fifty-five are peculiar to the second epistle, and

THE EPISTLE OF JUDE. 





1. Jude. Rev., Judas. One of the brethren of Jesus ; not 
the brother of James the Apostle, the son of Alphaeus, but of 
James the superintendent of the church at Jerusalem. He is 
named among the brethren of the Lord. Matt. xiii. 55; Mark 
vi. 3. 


Servant. He does not call himself an apostle, as Paul and 
Peter in their introductions, and seems to distinguish himself 
from the apostles in vv. 17,18: “The apostles of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, how that they said,” etc. We are told that 
Christ’s brethren did not believe on him (John vii. 5); and in 
Acts i. the brethren of Jesus (ver. 14) are mentioned in a way 
which seems to separate them from the apostles. AotaAos, 
bond-servant, occurs in the introductions to Romans, Philip- 
pians, Titus, James, and 2 Peter. 


Brother of James. That Jude does not allude to his rela- 
tionship to the Lord may be explained by the fact that the 
natural relationship in his mind would be subordinate to the 
spiritual (see Luke xi. 27, 28), and that such a designation 
would, as Dean Alford remarks, “ have been in harmony with 
those later and superstitious feelings with which the next and 
following ages regarded the Lord’s earthly relatives.” He 
would shrink from emphasizing a distinction to which none of 
the other disciples or apostles could have a claim, the more so 
because of his former'unbelief in Christ’s authority and mission. 
It is noticeable that James likewise avoids such a designation. 


732 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu L 


Kept. See on 1 Pet.i.4. Compare John xvii. 6, 12. 


In Jesus Christ (Incod Xpictd). The simple dative with- 
out preposition. Therefore for Jesus Christ; by the Father to 
whom Christ committed them (John xvii. 11). Compare 1 
Thess. v. 28; Philip. i. 6, 10. 


Called («Antois). At the end of the verse, for emphasis. 
2. Love. Peculiar to Jude in salutation. 


38. Beloved. Occurring at the beginning of an epistle only 
here and 3 John 2. 


When I gave all diligence (7acav o7rovéyy trovovpevos). 
Lit., making all diligence ; the phrase found only here. In 
Heb. vi. 11, we find “ shew diligence ” (évdelxvvc9ar) ; and in 2 
Pet. i. 5, “ adding diligence.” See note there. 


The common salvation. The best texts add suav, of us. 
So Rey., “‘ owr common salvation.” 


It was needful (avdayxnv éoxyov). Lit., J had necessity. Al- 
ford, [found i necessary. Rev., I was constrained. 


Earnestly contend (ézaywvifecdac). Only here in New 
Testament. 


The faith. The sum of what Christians believe. See on 
Acts vi. 7. 


Once (dak). Not formerly, but once for all. So Rev., 
“‘No other faith will be given,” says Bengel. 


4. With the whole verse compare 2 Pet. ii. 1. 
Crept in unawares (zapecédvcav). Rev., privily. See 


on 2 Pet. ii. 1. The verb means to get in by the side (aapd), 
to slip in by a side-door. Only here in New Testament. 


Cx. LJ THE EPISTLE OF JUDE. M3 


Ordained (poyeypaypévor). The meaning is in dispute. 
The word occurs four times in New Testament. In two of 
these instances po has clearly the temporal sense before (Rom. 
xv. 4; Eph. iii. 3). In Gal. iii. 1, it is taken by some in the 
sense of openly, publicly (see note there). It seems better, on 
the whole, to take it here in the temporal sense, and to render 
written of beforehand, i.e., in prophecy as referred to in vv. 14, 
15. So the American Rev. 


Lasciviousness. See on 1 Pet. iv. 3. 


Lord God. God is omitted in the best texts. On Lord 
(Sec7rornv), see on 2 Pet. ii. 1. 


5. Ye once knew (eidotas da). Entirely wrong. The 
participle is to be rendered as present, and the once is not for- 
merly, but once for all, as ver. 3. So Rev., rightly, though ye 
know all things once for alt. 


6. First estate (apy7v). The word originally signifies be- 
ginning, and so frequently in New Testament, mostly in the 
Gospels, Acts, Hebrews, Catholic Epistles, and Apocalypse. 
From this comes a secondary meaning of soverecgnty, dominion, 
magistracy, as being the beginning or first place of power. 
So mostly by Paul, as principalities (Rom. viii. 38); rude (L 
Cor. xv. 24). Compare Luke xii. 11, magistrates ; Rev., rulers ; 
and Luke xx. 20, power. Rev., rule. A peculiar use of the 
word occurs at Acts x. 11, “the sheet knit at the four corners 
(apyais);” the corners being the beginnings of the sheet. In 
this passage the A. V. has adopted the first meaning, beginning, 
in its rendering jirst estate. Rev. adopts the second, rendering 
principality. The Jews regarded the angels as having do- 
minion over earthly creatures ; and the angels are often spoken 
of in the New Testament as apyat, principalities; as Rom. 
viii. 838; Eph. i. 21; so that this term would be appropriate to 
designate their dignity, which they forsook. 


Habitation (oi«nrypiov). Only here and 2 Cor. v. 2. 


714 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. 1 


Everlasting (did¢dos). Only here and Rom. i. 20. For a 
longer form deéévos, from del, always. 


Under darkness (ro Sédov). Under carries the sense of 
the darkness brooding over the fallen spirits. On darkness, 
see on 2 Pet. ii. 4. Compare Hesiod: 


‘‘There the Titanian gods, to murky gloom 
Condemned by will of cloud-collecting Jove, 


Lie hid in region foul.” 
Theogony, v., 729. 


”. The cities about them. Admah and Zeboim. Deut 
SKIS yf LOSS Rac: 


Giving themselves over to fornication (éxopvevcacat). 
Rev., more strictly, having given, etc. Only here in New Tes- 
tament. The force of é« is out and out; giving themselves up 
utterly. See on followed, 2 Pet. 1. 16. 


Going after (amedJotcat omicw). The aorist participle. 
Rev., having gone. The phrase occurs Mark i. 20; James and 
John leaving their father and going after Jesus. “The world 
is gone after him” (John xii. 19). Here metaphorical. The 
force of avo is away; turning away from purity, and going 
after strange flesh. 


Strange flesh. Compare 2 Pet. ii. 10; and see Rom.i. 27; 
Ley. xviii. 22,23. Also Jowett’s introduction to Plato’s “ Sym- 
posium ;” Plato’s “ Laws,” vill., 836, 841; Déllinger, “The 
Gentile and the Jew,” Darnell’s trans., ii., 238 sq. 


Are set forth (apoxewrar). The verb means, literally, to ie 
exposed. Used of meats on the table ready for the guests; of 
a corpse laid out for burial; of a question under discussion. 
Thus the corruption and punishment of the cities of the plain 
are laid out in plain sight. 


As an example (defyya). Only here in New Testament. 
From delevum, to display or exhibit; something, therefore, 
which is held up to view as a warning. 


Cx. I] THE EPISTLE OF JUDE. 715 


Suffering the vengeance of eternal fire (arupos aiwviov 
dikenv Uréxovoa). Reyv., rightly, substitutes punishment for ven- 
geance, since dix carries the underlying idea of right or justice, 
which is not necessarily implied in vengeance. Some of the 
best modern expositors render are set forth as an example of 
eternal fire, suffering punishment. This meaning seems, on the 
whole, more natural, though the Greek construction favors the 
others, since eternal fire is the standing term for the finally 
condemned in the last judgment, and could hardly be correctly 
said of Sodom and Gomorrah. Those cities are most truly an 
example of eternal fire. “A destruction so utter and so per- 
manent as theirs has been, is the nearest approach that can be 
found in this world to the destruction which awaits those who 
are kept under darkness to the judgment of the great day” 
(Lumby). Suffering (iréyoveat). Only here in New Testa- 
ment. The participle is present, indicating that they are suffer- 
ing to this day the punishment which came upon them in Lot’s 
time. The verb means, literally, to hold under ; thence to up- 
hold or support, and so to suffer or undergo. 


8. Vet (uévror). Not rendered by A. V., but expressing 
that though they have these fearful examples before them, yet 
they persist in their sin. 


Dominion—dignities (xvpidrnta—dd£as). It is not easy 
to determine the exact meaning of these two terms. Kupiérns, 
‘dominion, occurs in three other passages, Eph. i. 21; Col. i. 16; 
2 Pet. ii. 10. In the first two, and probably in the third, the 
reference is to angelic dignities. Some explain this passage and 
the one in Peter, of evd angels. In Colossians the term is used 
with thrones, principalities, and powers, with reference to the 
orders of the celestial hierarchy as conceived by Gnostic teach- 
ers, and with a view to exalt Christ above all these. Glories or 
dignities is used in this concrete sense only here and at 2 Pet. 
iat). 


9. Michael the archangel. Here we strike a peculiarity 
of this epistle which caused its authority to be impugned in very 


716 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. 


early times, viz., the apparent citations of apocryphal writings. 
The passages are vv. 9, 14, 15. This reference to Michael was 
said by Origen to be founded on a Jewish work called “The 
Assumption of Moses,” the first part of which was lately found 
in an old Latin translation at Milan; and this is the view of 
Davidson, so far at least as the words “ the Lord rebuke thee” 
are concerned. Others refer it to Zech. iii. 1; but there is 
nothing there about Moses’ body, or Michael, or a dispute about 
the body. Others, again, to a rabbinical comment on Deut. 
xxxiv. 6, where Michael is said to have been made guardian of 
Moses’ grave. Doubtless Jude was referring to some accepted 
story or tradition, probably based on Deut. xxxiv. 6. Fora 
similar reference to tradition compare 2 Tim. ili. 8; Acts 
vii. 22. 


Michael. Angels are described in scripture as forming a 
society with different orders and dignities. This conception is 
developed in the books written during and after the exile, 
especially Daniel and Zechariah. Michael ( Who 7s like God ?) 
is one of the seven archangels, and was regarded as the special 
protector of the Hebrew nation. He is mentioned three times 
in the Old Testament (Dan. x. 13, 21; xii. 1), and twice in the 
New Testament (Jude 9 ; Apoc. xii. 7). He is adored as a saint 
in the Romish Church. For legends, see Mrs. Jameson, “ Sacred 
and Legendary Art,” i., 94 sq. 


A railing accusation (xpicw Bracdnpias). Lit., a judg- 
ment of railing; a sentence savoring of impugning his dignity. 
Michael remembered the high estate from which he fell, and 
left his sentence to God. 


10. Compare 2 Pet. ii. 12. 


They know not (ov« oiéacw). Mental comprehension and 
knowledge, and referring to the whole range of invisible things ; 
while the other verb in this verse, also translated by A. V. know 
(ériotavrat, originally of skill in handicraft), refers to palpable 
things; objects of sense; the circumstances of sensual enjoy-

ment. Rev. marks the distinction by rendering the latter verb 
understand. 


Naturally (gvouds). Only here in NewTestament. Com- 
pare dvawxa, natural, 2 Pet. ii. 12. 


11. Woe (ovai). Often used by our Lord, but never else- 
where except here and in the Apocalypse. The expression in 1 
Cor. ix. 16 is different. There the word is not used as an impreca- 
tion, but almost as a noun: “* Woe is unto me.” So Hos. ix. 12 


(Sept.). 


Ran greedily (éfeyvIncav). Lit., were poured out. Rev., 
ran riotously. A strong expression, indicating a reckless, aban- 
doned devotion of the energies, like the Latin effundi. So 
Tacitus says of Maecenas, “ he was given up to love for Bathy]- 
lus ;” lit., poured out into love. 


After. Better, as Rev., im ; as, “in the way of Cain.” The 
error was their sphere of action. Similarly, 


In the gainsaying (79 dvtiAoyia). In the practice of gain- 
saying like Korah’s. ’Avtvdoyia is from art, against, and déyo, 
to speak. Hence, literally, contradiction. Gainsay is a literal 
translation, being compounded of the Anglo-Saxon gegn, which 
reappears in the German gegen, against, and say. 


Korah. Who spake against Moses (Num. xvi. 3). The 
water which Moses brought from the rock at Kadesh was called 
the water of Meribah (Strife), or, in Septuagint, dowp avriAoyias, 
the water of contradiction. 


12. Spots (omirdées). Only here in New Testament. So 
rendered in A. V., because understood as kindred to omivor (2 
Pet. ii. 13); but rightly, as Rev., hidden rocks. So Homer, 
(“« Odyssey,” iii., 298), “ the waves dashed the ship against the 
rocks (amtrdbeccw).” See on deceivings, 2 Pet. ii. 13. These 
men were no longer mere Doés, but elements of danger and wreck. 


718 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. L 


When they feast with you. See on 2 Pet. ii. 13. 


Feeding (aowpatvorres). See on 1 Pet. v. 2. Lit., shepherd- 
ing themselves ; and so Rev., shepherds that feed themselves ; 
further their own schemes and lusts instead of tending the flock 
of God. Compare Isa. lvi. 11. 


Without fear (af08es). Of such judgments as visited Ana- 
nias and Sapphira. Possibly, as Lumby suggests, implying a 
rebuke to the Christian congregations for having suffered such 
practices. 


Clouds without water. Compare 2 Pet. ii. 17, springs 
without water. As clouds which seem to be charged with re- 
freshing showers, but are borne past (wapadepdpevar) and yield 
no rain. 


Whose fruit withereth (@3worwpwa). From $9ive or 
bio, to waste away, pine, and d7@pa, autumn. Hence, liter- 
ally, pertaining to the late autwmn, and rightly rendered by 
Rev., autwmn (trees). The A. V. is entirely wrong. Wyc., 
harvest trees. Tynd., trees without fruit at gathering-time. 


Twice dead. Not only the apparent death of winter, but a 
real death ; so that it only remains to pluck them up by the 
roots. 


13. Raging (@ypia). Rev., weld, which is better, as imply- 
ing quality rather than act. Waves, by nature wntamed. The 


act or expression of the nature is given by the next word. 


Foaming out (érad¢pitovra). Only here in New Testament. 
Compare Isa. lvii. 20. 


Shame (aicydivas)., Lit., shames or disgraces.

and without law, and must at last be severed from the lights 
which rule while they are ruled” (Lumby). 


Blackness (%édos). See on 2 Pet. ii. 4. 


Of darkness (rod cxorous). Lit., “the darkness,” the article 
pointing back to the darkness already mentioned, ver. 6. 


14. Enoch prophesied. This is the second of the apocry- 
phal passages referred to in notes on ver. 9. It is quoted from 
the apocryphal book of Enoch, directly, or from a tradition 
based upon it. The passage in Enoch is as follows: “ Behold 
he comes with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment 
upon them, and to destroy the wicked, and to strive (at law) 
with all the carnal for everything which the sinful and ungodly 
have done and committed against him.” The Book of Enoch, 
which was known to the fathers of the second century, was 
lost for some centuries with the exception of a few fragments, 
and was found entire in a copy of the Ethiopic Bible, in 1773, 
by Bruce. It became known to modern students through a 
translation from this into English by Archbishop Lawrence, in 
1821. It was probably written in Hebrew. It consists of rev- 
elations purporting to have been given to Enoch and Noah, and 
its object is to vindicate the ways of divine providence, to set 
forth the retribution reserved for sinners, angelic or human, 
and “to repeat in every form the great principle that the world— 
natural, moral, and spiritual—is under the immediate govern- 
ment of God.” Besides an introduction it embraces five parts: 
1. A narrative of the fall of the angels, and of a tour of Enoch 
in company with an angel through heaven and earth, and of 
the mysteries seen by him. 2. Parables concerning the king- 
dom of God, the Messiah, and the Messianic future. 3. Astro- 
nomical and physical matter; attempting to reduce the images 
of the Old Testament to a physical system. 4. Two visions, 
representing symbolically the history of the world to the Mes- 
sianic completion. 5. Exhortations of Enoch to Methuselah 
and his descendants. The book shows no Christian influence,

is highly moral in tone, and imitates the Old Testament 
myths. 


With ten thousands of his saints (év dylaus pupidow). 
Lit., in or among holy myriads. Compare Deut. xxxili. 2; 
Zech. xiv. 5. 


Ungodly (aceBeis)—ungodly deeds (épywv daceBelas, lit., 
works of ungodliness) which they have ungodly committed 
(jo¢8noav), and of all their hard speeches which ungodly 
(aceBeis) sinners, etc. The evident play upon the word wn- 
godly can be rendered but clumsily into English. Rev., trans- 
lates, All the ungodly, of all their works of ungodliness which 
they have ungodly wrought, and of all the hard things which 
ungodly sinners have spoken against him. The words ungodly 
sinners are placed in an unusual position, at the end of the sen- 
tence, for emphasis; ungodliness being the key-note of the writ- 
er’s thought. 


Hard (trav cxAnpav). Speeches issupplied. Lit., hard things. 
So Rev. The railing, gainsaying ; the profane and vain bab- 
blings (2 Tim. ii. 16). Compare John vi. 60, @ hard saying, 
where the word means not abuswe but dificult. In Jas. iii. 4, 
rough, used of the winds. In Acts xxvi. 14, of Saul of Tarsus ; 
“ hard to kick against the pricks.” 


16. Murmurers (yoyyvorat). Only herein New Testament. 
Doubtless, originally, with some adaptation of sound to sense, 
gongustat. It is used of the cooing of doves. 


Complainers (jeuipospor). From péudopar, to find fault 
with, and potpa, a part or lot. Lit., blamers of their lot. 


Great swelling words. See on 2 Pet. ii. 18. 
Having men’s persons in admiration (Savudfovtes mpdc-

Ungodly lusts (é7iIupudas tov doeBedv). Lit., lusts of

19. Separate themselves (dzrodvopifovres). Only here in 
New Testament. Zhemselves is unnecessary. Better, as Rev., 
make separations ; i.e., cause divisions in the church. The verb 
is compounded with ard, away ; did, through ; Bpos, a boundary 
line. Of those who draw a line through the church and set off 
one part from another. 


Sensual (uyuKo/). See on Mark xii. 30. As apuyy denotes 
life in the distinctness of individual existence, “the centre of 
the personal being, the T of each individual,” so this adjective 
derived from it denotes what pertains to man as man, the 
natural personality as distinguished from the renewed man. 
So 1 Cor. ii. 14; xv. 44. The rendering senswal, here and Jas. 
iii. 15, is inferential: senswal because natural and wnrenewed: 
In contrast with this is 


The spirit. The higher spiritual life. So the adjective 
avevpatixos, spiritual, is everywhere in the New Testament 
opposed to uyines, natural. See 1 Cor. xv. 44, 46. 


22. And of some have compassion, making a difference. 
This follows the reading, «al ods peév édeeire (€dedTe) SvaKpe-

would require, “On some have mercy who are in doubt. So

THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 


CHAPTER I. 


1. Jesus Christ. Only here and in ch. ii. 1; nowhere in 
the speeches of James (Acts xv. 14, 155; xxi. 20 sq.). Had 
he used Jesus’ name it might have been supposed to arise from 
vanity, because he was the Lord’s brother. In all the addresses 
of epistles the full name, Jesus Christ, is given. 


Servant (S0iX0s). Properly, Aired servant. Compare Phil- 
ip. L 1; Jude 1. 


That are scattered abroad (év 7H dvacmopa). Lit., a the 
dispersion ; on which see on 1 Pet i.1. Rev., which are of 
the dispersion. 


Greeting (yalpew). Lit., rejoice. The ordinary Greek salu- 
tation, hail! welcome! Also used at parting : joy be with you. 
Compare the same expression in the letter from the church at 
Jerusalem, Acts xv. 23; one of the very few peculiarities of 
style which connect this epistle with the James of the Acts. It 
does not occur in the address of any other of the Apostolic 
Epistles. 


9. All joy (racay xapav). Joy follows up the rejoice of the 
greeting. The ail has the sense of wholly. Count it a thing 
wholly joyful, without admixture of sorrow. Perhaps, as 
Bengel suggests, the ad/ applies to ald kinds of temptations. 


724 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. L 


When (érav). Lit., whenever : better, because it implies that 
temptation may be expected all along the Christian course. 


Ve fall into (sepuréonte). The preposition epi, around, 
suggests falling into something which surrounds. Thus Thu- 
cydides, speaking of the plague at Athens, says, “The Athe- 
nians, having fallen into (sepumecdvres) such afiliction, were 
pressed by it.” 


Divers (arouxidous). Rev., manifold. See on 1 Pet. i. 6. 


Temptations (rre:pacuois). In the general sense of ¢rzals. 
See on Matt. vi. 13; 1 Pet. i. 6. 


3. Trying (Soxiuuov). Rev., proof; but the American Re- 
visers insist on proving, and rightly. See on 1 Pet. i. 7. 


Worketh (xatepydteras). The compound verb with «ard, 
down through, indicates accomplishment. The proving will 
work successfully and thoroughly. This harmonizes with a 
perfect work, ver. 4. 


Patience (izropovnjv). See on 2 Pet. i. 6, and Jas. v. 7. 


4. Perfect work (épyov réXevov). “ This is followed by a 
perfect man. The man himself is characterized from his con- 
dition and work” (Bengel). Work (€pyov) is the word with 
which catepydfera, worketh, is compounded. It is the accom- 
plished result of patience in moral purification and ennobling. 
Compare work of faith, 1 Thess. i. 3. 


Perfect and entire (7édevou kal oNOKANpOL). The two words 
express different shades of thought. Tédewor, perfect, from 
téros, fulfilment or completion (perfect, from perfectus, per 
factus, made throughout), denotes that which has reached its 
maturity or fulfilled the end contemplated. ‘Odd«Anpos, from 
dros, entire, and KAhpos, a lot or allotment ; that which has all 
which properly belongs to it ; its entire allotment, and is, there- 


Cx. 1] THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 725 


fore, intact in all its parts. Thus Peter (Acts iii. 16) says of 
the restored cripple, “faith has given him this perfect sound: 
ness (OdoKAnpiav). Compare the familiar phrase, an accom- 
plished man. Note, also, James’ repetition of the key-words 
of his discourse, rejoice, joy, patience, perfect. 


Wanting nothing (é pnderi AeuTopevor). Rev., more liter- 
ally, lacking in nothing. Note James’ characteristic corrobora- 
tion of a positive statement by a negative clause: entire, lack- 
ing in nothing ; God that giveth and upbracdeth not; in faith, 
nothing doubting. The conditional negative pndevi, nothing, 18 
used, rather than the absolute negative ovdevi, as implying noth- 
ing which may be supposed ; uo posseble thing. 


5. But. Omitted in A. V. In pursuing this perfection you 
will find yourselves lacking in wisdom. One may say, “T know 
not how to become perfect ;” but, if any man, etc. 


Lack. Note the repetition. 


Of God that giveth (10d SddvT0s Ocod). The Greek puts it 
so that giving is emphasized as an attribute of God.  Lit., 
“ Ask of the giving God,” or of “ God the giver.” 


Liberally (ads). Only here in New Testament. Liter- 
ally the word means simply, and this accords with the following 
negative clause, uwpbraiding not. It is pure, simple giving of 
good, without admixture of evil or bitterness. Compare Rom. 
xii. 8, where a kindred noun is used: “ He that giveth let him 
do it with simplicity (év amddrnt).” Compare, also, Prov. x. 
92. Men often complicate and mar their giving with reproach, 
or by an assumption of superiority. 


6. Doubting (Svaxpurdpevos). Compare Matt. xxi. 21. Not 
equivalent to unbelief, but expressing the hesitation which 
balances between faith and unbelief, and inclines toward the 
Jatter. This idea is brought out in the next sentence. 


726 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cx I 


A wave (Ava). Rev., surge. Only here and Luke viii. 
94; though the kindred verb occurs at Eph. iv. 14. The 
word is admirably chosen, as by a writer who lived near the 
sea and was familiar with its aspects. The general distinction 
between this and the more common «dpa, wave, is that crAvdov 
describes the long ridges of water as they are propelled in 
horizontal lines over the vast surface of the sea; while cipa 
denotes the pointed masses which toss themselves up from 
these under the action of the wind. Hence the word «Avda 
here is explained, and the picture completed by what follows: 
a billow or surge, driven by the wind in lines, and tossed into 
waves. Both here and in the passage in Luke the word is used 
in connection with the wind. It emphasizes the idea of exten- 
ston, while the other word throws forward the idea of concen- 
trating into a crest at a given point. Hence, in the figure, the 
emphasis falls on the ¢ossing ; not only moving before the im- 
pulse of the wind, but not even moving in regular lines ; tossed 
into rising and falling peaks. 


Driven by the wind (dveysfouévq). Only here in New Tes- 
tament. 


Tossed (fumefouéve). Only here in New Testament. From 
puris, a fan. Anyone who has watched the great ocean-swell 
throwing itself up into pointed waves, the tops of which are 
caught by the wind and fanned off into spray, will appreciate 
the vividness of the figure. 


7. That man (éxeivos). Emphatic, and with a slightly con- 
temptuous force. 


Anything, ¢.¢., which he asks for. 


8. A double-minded man is unstable, ete. The A. V. 
puts this as an independent apophthegm, which is wrong. The 
sentence is a comment and enlargement upon that man. “ Let 
not that man think,” etc., “a double-minded man, unstable in 
all his ways.” So Rev. 


Co}: oan | THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 127 


Double-minded (Spvyos). Peculiar to James, here and 
ch. iv. 8. Not deceitful, but dubious and undecided. 


Unstable (axatdotatos). Only here in New Testament. 
The kindred dxatactacia, confusion, is found ch. iii. 16, and 
elsewhere. 


9. But. Omitted in A.V. Introducing a contrast with the 
double-minded. 


The brother of low degree (0 ddeAdos 6 tamewos). Lit., 
the brother, the lowly one. Not in the higher Christian sense 
of tazrewos (see on Matt. xi. 29), but, rather, poor and afflicted, 
as contrasted with rch. 


Rejoice (xavyadcIw). Not strong enough. It is, rather, boast. 
So Rev., glory. Compare Rom. v. 3; Philip. iii. 3. 


In that he is exalted (€v 7 typer adrov). Lit., in hes ex- 
altation. Rev., in his high estate. 


10. In that he is made low (év 77 Tazrewdcer avtov). A 
form of expression similar to the preceding. Lit., on his hu- 
miliation. Both the A. V. and Rev. preserve the kinship be- 
tween tazrewos and tarewwoe, by the word low. 


Flower (av3os). Only here, ver. 11, and 1 Pet. i. 24. 


11. For the sun is no sooner risen, etc. (avérehev yap o 
Hrwos). By the use of the aorist tense James graphically throws 
his illustration into the narrative form: “ For the sun arose 
—and withered,” ete. 


With a burning heat (7d Kxatcorv). Rev., with the scorch- 
ing wind. The article denotes something familiar; and the 
reference may be to the scorching east-wind (Job i. 19, Sept. ; 
Ezek. xvii. 10), which withers vegetation. Some of the best 
authorities, however, prefer the rendering of the A. V. 


728 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. L 
Falleth (ééémecev). Aorist tense. Lit., fell off. 


The grace of the fashion (edpereva rob mpoowmov).  Lit., 
the beauty of its face or appearance. Evmpémeva only here in 
New Testament. 


Fade away (uvapavSjcera). See on 1 Pet. i. 4. 


Ways (zopelais). Rev., goings. Only here and Luke xiii. 
92. His goings to and fro in acquiring riches. 


12. Is tried (Sdxysos yevdpevos).  Lit., having become ap- 
proved. See on trial, 1 Pet. i. 7. The meaning is not, as the 
A. V. suggests, when his treat is finished, but when he has 
been approved by trial. Rev., rightly, when he hath been ap- 
proved. 


The crown (crédavov). See on 1 Pet. v. 4. 


Of life (ris Sams). Lit., the life: the article pointing to the 
well-known eternal life. The figure is not that of the athlete’s 
crown, for an image from the Grecian games, which the Jews 
despised, would be foreign to James’ thought and displeasing 
to his readers. Rather the kingly crown, the proper word for 
which is SudSnua, diadem. In Ps. xx. 3 (Sept.), crépavos is 
used of the royal crown. In Zech. vi. 11, 14, the reference 
seems to be to a priestly crown, forming part of the high- 
priest’s mitre. 


13. Of God (a6 @eod). Lit., from God. Not by God, as 
the direct agent, but by agency proceeding from God. Com- 
pare Matt. iv. 1, where the direct agency, “by the spirit,” “by 
the devil,” is expressed by v7ro. 


Cannot be tempted (azreipactos éort). Lit., 2s incapable 
of being tempted. But some of the best expositors render 2s 
unversed in evil things, as better according both with the usage 
of the word and with the context, since the question is not of 


Cu. 1] THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 729 


God’s being tempted, but of God’s tempting. Rev. gives this 
in margin. “Amecpactos only here in New Testament. 


Neither tempteth he (ceupafer de adtos). The A. V. fails 
to render adtos: “ He himself tempteth no man.” So Rev. 


14. Drawn away (éfeArKdpevos). Only here in New Testa- 
ment. This and the following word are metaphors from hunt- 
ing and fishing. Drawn away, as beasts are enticed from a 
safecovert into a place beset with snares. Note the present 
participle, as indicating the progress of the temptation: “is 
being drawn away.” 


Enticed (Scdeaféuevos). As a fish with bait. Also the 
present participle. See on 2 Pet. ii. 14. 


15. The lust. Note the article, omitted in A. V. The 
peculiar lust of his own. 


Hath conceived (cvAraBotca). Lit., having conceived. 


Bringeth forth (réerec). Metaphor of the mother. Rev., 
beareth. 


When it is finished (dzroredecSeica). Better, Rev., when 
it is full grown. Not when the course of a sinful life is com- 
pleted; but when sin has reached its full development. 


Bringeth forth (dzoxve). A different verb from the pre- 
ceding, bringeth forth. Rev. has rendered rikres, beareth, in 
order to avoid the repetition of bringeth forth. The verb is 
used by James only, here and at ver. 18. The image is inter- 
preted in two ways. Hither (1) Sin, figured as female, is already 
pregnant with death, and, when full grown, bringeth forth 
death (so Rev., and the majority of commentators). “ The har- 
lot, Lust, draws away and entices the man. The guilty union 
is committed by the will embracing the temptress: the con- 
sequence is that she beareth sin, . . . Then ¢he sin, that 


730 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. L 


particular sin, when grown up, herself, as if all along pregnant 
with it, bringeth forth death” (Alford). Or (2) Sin, figured as 
male, when it has reached maturity, becomes the begetter of 
death. So the Vulgate, generat, and Wyc., gendereth. I am 
inclined to prefer this, since the other seems somewhat forced. 
It has the high endorsement of Bishop Lightfoot. There is a 
suggestive parallel passage in the “ Agamemnon” of Aeschylus, 
151-771 : 


‘¢ There is a saying old, 
Uttered in ancient days, 
That human bliss, full-grown, 
Genders, and dies not childless : 
And, for the coming race, 
Springs woe insatiate from prosperity. 
But I alone 
Cherish within my breast another thought. 
The impious deed 
Begets a numerous brood alike in kind ; 
While households ruled by right inflexible 
Blossom with offspring fair. 
Insolence old 
In men depraved begetteth insolence, 
Which springs afresh from time to time 
As comes the day of doom, and fresh creates 
In Ate’s dismal halls 
Fierce wrath from light, 
Unhallowed Daring, fiend invincible, 
Unconquered, with its parents’ likeness stamped.” 


The magnificent passage in Milton’s “ Paradise Lost,” ii., 760- 
801, is elaborated from these verses of James. 


17. The first words of this verse form a hexameter line, thus: 
Ilaca 80\cus ayal97 Kat| wav 80\pnua té|Aevov. 


Such verses, or parts of verses, occur occasionally in the New 
Testament. Sometimes they are quotations from the Greek 
poets; sometimes the writer’s words unconsciously fall into 


metrical form. Poetical quotations are confined to Paul, Acts 
RviLe2e: MuCor, xv. 33> Lit. 142: 


Cu. I.] THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. Fou 


Every good gift and every perfect gift (see Greek above). 
The statement that these gifts are from God is in pursuance of 
the idea that God does not tempt men to evil. The gifts of 
God are contrasted with the evil springing from man’s lust. 
Two words are used for gift. Adcrs occurs only here and 
Philip. iv. 15; there in an active sense; but here passive, as in 
Prov. xxi. 14 (Sept.). Aapnua is found Rom. v.16. It enlarges 
slightly upon the other word in emphasizing the gift as free, 
large, full ; an idea which is further developed in ver. 18, of his 
own will. The Rev., rather awkwardly, endeavors to bring out 
the distinction by the word boon, for which the American Revis- 
ers insist on retaining gift. Boon originally means a petition ; 
favor being a secondary and later sense, as of something given 
in response to a petition. The word is of Scandinavian origin, 
and the meaning favor seems to indicate a confusion with the 
Latin bonus, good; French, bon. 


Perfect. Enlarges upon good, bringing out more distinctly 
the moral quality of the gift. 


And cometh down (xaraBaivov). A present participle, to 
be construed with dvwIev éotwv, is from above. Lit., is coming 
down from above. Asusual, this union of the participle with the 
finite verb denotes something habitual. Render, descendeth 
from above. Compare ch. iii. 15. 


Father of lights (rod watpés tov porwr). Lit., the lights, 
by which are meant the heavenly bodies. Compare Ps. exxxv. 
7 (Sept.); and Jer. iv. 23 (Sept.). God is called “the Father of 
the lights,” as being their creator and maintainer. Compare 
Job xxxviii. 28; Ps. viii. 3; Amos v. 8. 


Is no variableness (é). Abbreviated from éveots, 7s m. 
Stronger than the simple ¢s, and denoting inherence or indwell- 
ing. Rev., can be. 


Variableness (srapadAayi)). Better, Rev., variation. The 
word is not used, as some suppose, in a technical, astronomical 


732 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. I. 


sense, which James’ readers would not have understood, but in 
the simple sense of change in the degree or intensity of light, 
such as is manifested by the heavenly bodies. Compare Plato, 
“ Republic,” vii., 580: “ Will he (the astronomer) not think that 
the heaven and the things in heaven are framed by the Creator 
in the most perfect manner? But when he reflects that the 
proportions of night and day, or of both, to the month, or of the 
month to the year, or of the other stars to these and to one an- 
other, are of the visible and material, he will never fall into the 
error of supposing that they are eternal and liable to no devia- 
tion (odSév wapadddrrew)—that would be monstrous.” 


Shadow of turning (tpomfs arocxiacua). This is popularly 
understood to mean that there is in God not the faintest hent or 
shade of change, like the phrase, a shadow of suspicion. But 
the Greek has no such idiom, and that is not James’ meaning. 
Rev., rightly, renders, shadow that is cast by turning ; referring 
still to the heavenly orbs, which cast shadows in their revolution, 
as when the moon turns her dark side to us, or the sun is 
eclipsed by the body of the moon. 


18. Begat (dmextncev). Rev., brought forth. See on ver. 
15, and compare 1 John iii. 9; 1 Pet. i. 23. 


A kind of first-fruits (a7apynv twa). A kind of indicates 
the figurative nature of the term. The figure is taken from the 
requirement of the Jewish law that the first-born of men and 
cattle, and the first growth of fruits and grain should be conse- 
crated to the Lord. The point of the illustration is that Chris- 
tians, like first-fruits, should be consecrated to God. The ex- 
pression “ first-fruits” is common in the New Testament. See 
Rom. viii. 23; xvi. 5; 1 Cor. xv. 20, 28; Apoc. xiv. 4. 


19. Wherefore. The A. V. follows the reading dere. But 
the correct reading is tote, ye know, and so Rev. Others render 
it as imperative, know ye, as calling attention to what follows. 


21. Filthiness (puzapiéav). Only here in New Testament, 
but James uses the kindred adjective (ch. ii. 2), ‘‘ vide raiment.” 


Cu. I.] THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. Hoo 


‘Pros, filth, occurs in 1 Pet. iii. 21—on which see notes ; and 
the verb pu7ow, to be filthy, is found in Apoc. Keithley 


Superfluity of naughtiness (wepicceiav Kaxias). A trans- 
lation which may be commended to the attention of indiscrim- 
inate panegyrists of the A. V. ITepscceia is an unciassical 
word, and occurs in three other New-Testament passages—Rom. 
y. 17; 2 Oor. viii. 2; x. 15. In all these it is rendered abun- 
dance, both by A. V. and Rev. There seems to be no need of 
departing from this meaning here, as Rev., overflowing. The 
sense is abounding or abundant wickedness. For naughtiness 
Rev. gives wickedness, as in 1 Pet. ii. 1, 16, where it changes 
malice to wickedness. It is mostly rendered malice in both A. 
V. and Rev. In this passage, as in the two from Peter, Rev. 
gives malice, in margin. Malice is an adequate translation, the 
word denoting a malevolent disposition toward one’s neighbor. 
Hence it is not a general term for moral evil, but a special form 
of vice. Compare the wrath of man, ver. 20. Maughtiness 
has acquired a petty sense in popular usage, as of the mischiev-

here. 


With meekness (év zpairnts). Lit., “im meekness 5” op- 
posed to malice. 


Engrafted (gudurov). Only here in New Testament. Bet- 
ter, and more literally, as Rev., implanted. It marks a char- 
acteristic of the word of truth (ver. 18). It is emplanted ; 
divinely given, in contrast with something acquired by study. 
Compare Matt. xiii. 19, ‘‘ the word of the kingdom—sown in 
his heart.” Grafted or graffed is expressed by a peculiar word, 
employed by Paul only, éyxevtp(fm, from KévTpov, a sharp point, 
thus emphasizing the fact of the iczseon required in grafting. 
See Rom. xi. 17, 19, 23, 24. 


Which is able to save (rov Svvduevov coat). Compare 
Rom. i. 16, “the power of God unto salvation.” 


29. Hearers (dxpoatat). Used by James only. 


134 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. I. 


Deceiving (raparoy:fopevor). From trapd, beside, contrary 
to, and royifopas, to reckon, and hence to conclude by reasoning. 
The deception referred to is, therefore, that into which one 
betrays himself by false reasoning—reasoning beside the truth. 


23. Beholding (catavoodyrt). With the notion of attentwely 
considering (xara, down into, or through ; compare eis, into, 
ver. 25). Compare Luke xii. 24, 27; Heb. iii. 1. So that the 
contrast is not between a hasty look and a careful contempla- 
tion (ver. 25, dooketh). It is not mere careless hearing of the 
word which James rebukes, but the neglect to carry into prac- 
tice what is heard. One may be an attentive and critical hearer 
of the word, yet not a doer. 


His natural face (To mpocwmov tis yevéoews). Lit., the 
countenance of his birth ; the face he was born with. 


In a glass (év éodrtp@). Better, Rev., a mirror ; a metallic 
mirror. The word occurs only here and 1 Cor. xiii. 12. 


24. He beholdeth (xatevoncev). The aorist tense, throwing 
the sentence into a lively, narrative form: he beheld himself 
and forgot. Compare ver. 11. 


25. Whoso looketh (6 wapaxivas). Rev., more strictly, he 
that looketh. See on 1 Pet. i. 12. The verb is used of one who 
stoops szdeways (apd) to look attentively. The mirror is con- 
ceived as placed on a table or on the ground. Bengel quotes 
Wisdom of Sirach xiv. 23: “He that prieth in at her (Wis- 
dom’s) windows shall also hearken at her doors.” Coleridge 
remarks: ‘“‘ A more happy or forcible word could not have been 
chosen to express the nature and ultimate object of reflection, 
and to enforce the necessity of it, in order to discover the living 
fountain and spring-head of the evidence of the Christian faith 
in the believer himself, and at the same time to point out the 
seat and region where alone it is to be found” (“ Aphorisms”). 


Into (es). Denoting the penetration of the look into the 
very essence of the law. 


Cu. 1.J THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 735 


The perfect law of liberty (vouov rérevov Tov THs édevde- 
pias). Lit., the perfect law, the law of liberty. So Rev. The 
law of liberty is added as defining the perfect law. 


Continueth therein. Better, Rev., so contimueth; i.e., 
continues looking. 


Forgetful hearer (axpoats émuAnopovijs). The latter word 
only here in New Testament. Lit., a hearer of forgetfulness ; 
whom forgetfulness characterizes. Rev., very happily, a hearer 
that forgetteth ; a rendering which gives the proper sense of 
forgetfulness as a characteristic better than A. V., a forgetful 
hearer. 


Doer of the work. Lit., of work, as the noun has no ar- 
ticle. Rev., a doer that worketh. 


In his deed (€ 7H moujoes adtod). More correctly, as Rev., 
in his doing. Only here in New Testament. The preposition 
év (in) marks the inner connection between doing and blessed- 
ness. ‘The life of obedience is the element wherein the 
blessedness is found and consists” (Alford). 


26. Seem to be (Soxez). Rev., correctly, thinketh himself 
to be. A man can scarcely seem to be religious, when, as Trench 
observes, “his religious pretensions are belied and refuted by 
the allowance of an unbridled tongue.” 


Religious (Spjoxos). Only here in New Testament, and 
nowhere in classical Greek. The kindred noun Jpnoxeia, re- 
ligion, occurs Acts xxvi. 5; Col. ii. 18; Jas. i, 26, 27; and 
means the ceremonial service of religion. Herodotus (ii., 37) 
uses it of various observances practised by the Egyptian priests, 
such as wearing linen, circumcision, shaving, etc. The deriva- 
tion is uncertain. Opéoua, to mutter forms of prayer, has 
been suggested, as the followers of Wycliffe were called Lol- 
lards, from the old Dutch Jullen or lollen, to sing. Hence the 
adjective here refers to a zealous and diligent performance 
of religious services. 


736 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. IL 


Bridleth (yaawaywyavr). Used by James only. See ch. ii. 
9, Lit., to guide with a bridle. So Plato, “ Laws,” 701: “I 
think that the argument ought to be pulled up from time to 
time, and not to be allowed to run away, but held with bit and 
bridle.” 


27. Undefiled (auéavros). See onl Pet.i.4. The two ad- 
jectives, pure and undefiled, present the positive and negative — 
sides of purity. 


To visit (émucxérrecSas). See on Matt. xxv. 36. James 
strikes a downright blow here at ministry by proxy, or by mere 
gifts of money. Pure and undefiled religion demands personal 
contact with the world’s sorrow: to visit the afflicted, and to 
visit them in their affliction. “The rich man, prodigal of 
money, which is to him of little value, but altogether incapable 
of devoting any personal attention to the object of his alms, 
often injures society by his donations; but this is rarely the 
case with that far nobler charity which makes men familiar 
with the haunts of wretchedness, and follows the object of its 
care through all the phases of his life” (Lecky, “ History of 
European Morals,” ii., 98). 


To keep (rmpetv). See on 1 Pet. i. 4. 


Unspotted (do7vAov). See on 1 Pet. i. 19. 


CHAPTER II. 


1. Have (éyere). Rev., hold, not in the sense of hold fast, 
cleave to, but of possessing, occupying, and practising, as a 
matter of habit. Thus we say that a man Aolds his property 
by a certain tenure. A rented estate is a holding. So of an 
opinion, or set of opinions, with which one is publicly identified. 
We say that he olds thus and so. 


With respect of persons (év mpocwrodnpyias). From 
mpocwrov, the countenance, and rapBdvew, to receive. To re-

ceive the countenance is a Hebrew phrase. Thus Levit. xix. 15 
(Sept.) : Ob Aippy tpocwrov rrwxod: Thou shalt not respect the 
person (recewe the countenance) of the poor. Compare Luke 
xx. 21; Rom. ii. 11; and Jude 16. 


The Lord of glory. Compare 1 Cor. ii. 8; Acts vil. 2; 
Rok iit 


2. Assembly (cvvaywyiv). The word synagogue is a tran- 
script of this. From ovv, dogether, and aya, to bring. Hence, 
literally, a gathering or congregation, in which sense the word 
is common in the Septuagint, not only of assemblies for wor- 
ship, but of gatherings for other public purposes. From the 
meeting itself the transition is easy to the place of meeting, 
the synagogue ; and in this sense the term is used throughout the 
New Testament, with the following exceptions: In Acts xiii. 
43, it is rendered congregation by the A. V., though Rev. gives 
synagogue ; and in Apoc. ii. 9; iii. 9, the unbelieving Jews, as 
a body, are called synagogue of Satan. As a designation of a 
distinctively Jewish assembly or place of worship it was more 
sharply emphasized by the adoption of the word éxkAyola, 
ecclesia, to denote the Christian church. In this passage alone 
the word is distinctly applied to a Christian assembly or place 
of worship. The simplest explanation appears to be that the 
word designates the place of meeting for the Christian body, 
James using the word most familiar to the Jewish Christians ; 
an explanation which receives countenance from the fact that, 
as IUuther observes, “the Jewish Christians regarded them- 
selves as still an integral part of the Jewish nation, as the 
chosen people of God.” As such a portion they had their 
special synagogue. From Acts vi. 9, we learn that there were 
numerous synagogues in Jerusalem, representing different bod- 
ies, such as the descendants of Jewish freedmen at Rome, and 
the Alexandrian or Hellenistic Jews. Among these would be 
the synagogue of the Christians, and such would be the case in 
all large cities where the dispersed Jews congregated. Alford 
quotes a phrase from the “ Testaments of the Twelve Patri- 
archs:” the synagogue of the Gentiles. Compare Heb. x. 25, 
“the assembling together (émecvvarywyiv) of yourselves.”

738 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IL. 


With a gold ring (xpuvcodaxridos). Only here in New 
Testament. Not a man wearing a single gold ring (as A. V. 
and Rev.), which would not attract attention in an assembly 
where most persons wore a ring, but @ gold-ringed man, having 
his hands conspicuously loaded with rings and jewels. The 
ring was regarded as an indispensable article of a Hebrew’s at- 
tire, since it contained his signet; and the name of the ring, 
tabbath, was derived from a root signifying to impress a seal. 
It was a proverbial expression for a most valued object. See 
Isa. xxii. 24; Hag. ii. 23. The Greeks and Romans wore them 
in great profusion. Hannibal, after the battle of Cannae, sent 
as a trophy to Carthage, three bushels of gold rings from 
the fingers of the Roman knights slain in battle. To wear 
rings on the right hand was regarded as a mark of effemi- 
nacy ; but they were worn profusely on the left. Martial says 
of one Charinus that he wore six on each finger, and never laid 
them aside, either at night or when bathing. The fops had 
rings of different sizes for summer and winter. Aristophanes 
distinguishes between the populace and those who wear rings, 
and in his comedy of “The Clouds” uses the formidable word 
ofppayidovuyapyoxophtat, lazy, long-haired fops, with rings 
and well-trimmed nails. Demosthenes was so conspicuous for 
this kind of ornament that, at a time of public disaster, it was 
stigmatized as unbecoming vanity. Frequent mention is made 
of their enormous cost. They were of gold and silver, some- 
times of both ; sometimes of iron inlaid with gold. The pos- 
sible beauty of these latter will be appreciated by those who 
have seen the elegant gold and iron jewellery made at Toledo, 
in Spain. Sometimes they were of amber, ivory, or porcelain. 
The practice of wearing rings was adopted by the early Chris- 
tians. Many of their rings were adorned with the symbols of 
the faith—the cross, the anchor, the monogram of Christ, etc. 
Among the rings found in the catacombs are some with a key, 
and some with both a key and a seal, for both locking and seal- 
ing a casket. 


Goodly apparel (éo9/7 Xaurpa). Lit. bright or shining 
clothes. Rev., fine clothing. 


Cn It THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 739 


Vile (6u7rapa). Compare ch. i. 21; and see on 1 Pet. in. 21. 


3. Ve have respect (é7i8réWyrte). Lit., ye look upon, with 
the idea of respectful consideration ; ye regard. Compare Luke 
1.48; ix. 38. 


in a good place (xandds). Lit., honorably; in a seat of 
honor. 


Under. Not literally wnderneath, but down on the ground 
beside. Compare Matt. xxiii. 6, on the fondness of the Jews 
for the chief places in the synagogue. 


4. Are ye not partial in yourselves ? (ov Svexpidnre év 
éavrois). Wrong. The constant sense of the verb in the New 
Testament is doubt, except Acts xi. 2; Jude 9, where it means 
dispute. Compare ch. i. 6. The meaning here is, therefore, 
that, in making a distinction between the rich and the poor, they 
expressed a doubt concerning the faith which they professed, 
and which abolished such distinctions. Hence, Rev., rightly, 
Are ye not divided in your own mind ? 


Judges of evil thoughts («pital Siaroywouav rovnpdy). 
Better, as Rev., “judges with evil thoughts.” The form of ex- 
pression is the same as in Luke xviii. 6, «pestis Tis aducias, the 
judge of injustice, ie., the unjust judge. So Jas. 1. 25, a 
hearer of forgetfulness. The word thoughts is, rather, reason- 
ings. See on deceiving yourselves (ch. i. 22). Compare Luke 
v.21. Their evil processes of thought lead to these unjust dis- 
criminations. 


5. Hearken, my beloved brethren. Alford cites this 
phrase as one of the very few links which connect this epistle 
with the speech of James in Acts xv. 13. 


The poor of this world (rods mra@xovds Tod Koopov). But 
the correct reading is 7 xiao, to the world ; and the ex- 
pression is to be explained in the same way as dotetos TO Oe, 


740 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. IL 


fair unto God, Acts vii. 20, and duvata TO Oe@, mighty 
through (Rev., before) God, 2 Cor. x. 4. So Rev., poor as to the 
world, in the world’s esteem. 007, see on Matt. v. 3. 


Rich in faith. The Rev., properly, inserts to be, since the 
words are not in apposition with poor, but express the object 
for which God has chosen them. Faith is not the gualeéy in 
which they are to be rich, but the sphere or element ; rich in 
their position as believers. ‘Not the measure of faith, in 
virtue of which one man is richer than another, is before the 
writer’s mind, but the substance of the faith, by virtue of which 
every believer is rich” (Wiesinger, cited by Alford). 


6. Despised (jryudcate). Not strong enough. They had 
manifested their contempt ; had done despite to them. Rev., 
correctly, dishonored. From the use of the aorist tense, ye dis- 
honored, which the A. V. and Rev. render as a perfect, ye have 
dishonored, the reference would appear to be to a specific act 
like that described in vv. 2, 3. 


Oppress (xataSuvacrtevovorv). Only here and Acts x. 38. 
The preposition card, against, implies a power exercised for 
harm. Compare being lords over, 1 Pet. v. 3, and ewercise do- 
minion, Matt. xx. 25, both compounded with this preposition. 


Draw (éacovow). Not strong enough. The word implies 
violence. Wence, better, as Rev., drag. Compare Livy’s phrase, 
“ g lictoribus trahi, to be dragged by the lictors to judgment ; ” 
Acts viii. 3, of Saul haling or hauling men and women to prison ; 
and Luke xii. 58. 


Judgment-seats (xpirjpia). Only here and 1 Cor, vi. 24. 


7. They (adrol). Emphatic. “Is it not they who blas- 
pheme?” 


Worthy (xadov). Rev., better, because stronger, honorable. 
By this epithet the disgracefulness of the blasphemy is empha- 
sized. 


Cu, IL.]j THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 741 


By the which ye are called (70 érucrndev ef vuas).  Lit., 
which is called upon you ; the name of Christ, invoked in bap- 
tism. The phrase is an Old-Testament one. See Deut. xxviii. 
10, where the Septuagint reads that the name of the Lord has 
been called upon thee. Also, 2 Chron. vii. 14; Isa. iv. 1. Com- 
pare Acts xv. 17. 


8. Fulfil the royal law (vouov terete Baoihixov). The 
phrase occurs only here and Rom. ii. 27. Teretv, fulfil, is 
stronger than the more common word tnpety, observe or keep, 
which appears in ver. 10. Compare, also, Matt. xix. 17; xxii. 
3; John xiv. 15, etc. James here speaks of a single com- 
mandment, the proper word for which is évtody, while voyos 
is the body of commandments. It is appropriate here, how- 
ever, since this special commandment sums up the entire law. 
See Rom. xiii. 10; Gal. v.14. It is the royal law; the king 
of all laws. 

The phrase royal law is of Roman origin (Jew regia). In the 
kingly period of Roman history it did not signify a law pro- 
mulgated by the absolute authority of the king, but a law passed 
by a popular assembly under the presidency of the king. In 
later times the term was applied to all laws the origin of which 
was attributed to the time of the kings. Gradually the term 
came to represent less of the popular will, and to include all the 
rights and powers which the Roman people had formerly pos- 
sessed, so that the emperor became what formerly the people 
had been, sovereign. “It was not,” says Gibbon, “before the 
ideas and even the language of the Romans had been corrupted, 
that a royal law (dew regia) and an irrevocable gift of the people 
were created. . . . The pleasure of the emperor, accord- 
ing to Justinian, has the vigor and effect of law, since the Roman 
people, by the royal law, have transferred to their prince the 
full extent of their own power and sovereignty. The will of 
a single man, of a child, perhaps, was allowed to prevail over 
the wisdom of ages and the inclinations of millions; and the 
degenerate Greeks were proud to declare that in his hands 
alone the arbitrary exercise of legislation could be safely depos- 
ited ” (“ Decline and Fall,” ch. xliv.).

9, Ve have respect to persons (apoowmoAnpr retire). Only 
here in New Testament. See on ver. 1. 


Ye commit sin (duapriav epydgeo9e). Lit., “work sin.” 
Compare Matt. vii. 28; Acts x. 35 ; Heb. xi. 33. The phrase 
is rather stronger than the more common duaprtiav rovetv, to do 
sin, John viii. 34; Jas. v.15; 1 Pet. ii. 22. The position of 
sin is emphatic: “it is se that ye are working.” 


And are convinced (éreyxdpevor). Rather, as Rev., con- 
victed. The word, which is variously rendered in A. V. tell a 
fault, reprove, rebuke, convince, while it carries the idea of 7e- 
buke, implies also a rebuke which produces a conviction of the 
error or sin. See on John viii. 46. Compare John iii. 20; 
viii. 9; 1 Cor. xiv. 24, 25. 


10. Keep (tnpjon). See on ver. 8. 
Offend (araicy). Lit., as Rev., stumble. 


He is guilty (yéyovev evoyos). Lit., he is become guilty. 
"Evoxos, guilty, is, strictly, holden ; within the condemning 
power of. Compare Matt. xxvi. 66; Mark iii. 29; 1 Cor. xi. 
27. Huther cites a Talmudic parallel : “ But if he perform all, 
but omit one, he is guilty of every single one.” 


11. A transgressor (zapaBdrns). From mapa, beyond, and 
Balve, to go. A transgressor, therefore, is one who goes beyond 
the line. So, also, trespass, which is transpass, from the Latin 
trans, across, aud passus, a step. A similar word occurs in 
Homer, bmepBacia, a transgression or trespass, from vb7rép, over, 
and Baiva, to go. 


12. So. With reference to what follows, speak and do.

eos). Lit., as Rev., judgment is without mercy to him that 
hath shewed no mercy. Both A. V. and Rev. omit the article 
“the judgment,” that, namely, which is coming. [TZath shewed, 
or, lit., shewed (aorist tense). The writer puts himself at the 
stand-point of the judgment, and looks backward. 


Rejoiceth (cataxavyatat). The simple verb xavydopas 
means to speak loud, to be loud-tongued ; hence, to boast. 
Better, therefore, as Rev., glorieth. Judgment and mercy are 
personified. While judgment threatens condemnation, mercy 
interposes and prevails over judgment. “Mercy is clothed 
with the divine glory, and stands by the throne of God. When 
we are in danger of being condemned, she rises up and pleads 
for us, and covers us with her defence, and enfolds us with her 
wings” (Chrysostom, cited by Gloag). 


14. What doth it profit 2? (ri 7d dgedos). Lit., what is the 
profit? "Odedos, profit, only here, ver. 16, and 1 Cor. xv. 32. 


15. Be (irdpywow). The distinction between this word and 
the simple eivau, to be, is very subtle. The verb vTrapY® origi- 
nally means to make a beginning ; hence, to begin or to come 
into being ; and, though used substantially as a synonym of 
elvat, of a thing actually existing and at hand, it has a back- 
ward look to an antecedent condition which has been protracted 
into the present. Thus we might paraphrase here, “If a 
brother or sister, having been in a destitute condition, be found 
by you in that condition.” Eivas, on the other hand, would 
simply state the present fact of destitution. See on 2 Pet. i. 8. 


Destitute (Aevmopuevor). Lit., left behind ; and hence lacking, 
as Rev. Compare ch. i. 4,5. This usage of the word occurs 
in James only.

tithesis more sharply by keeping more closely to the Greek 
order: J by my works will shew, ete. 


19. Tremble (¢piccovow). Only here in New Testament. 
It means, originally, to be rough on the surface; to bristle. 
Hence, used of the fields with ears of corn; of a line of battle 
bristling with shields and spears; of a silver or golden vessel 
rough with embossed gold. Aeschylus, describing a crowd 
holding up their hands to vote, says, the air bristled with 
right hands. Hence, of a horror which makes the hair stand 
on end and contracts the surface of the skin, making ‘‘ goose- 
flesh.” Rev., much better, shudder. 


20. Vain (xevé). Lit., empty, without spiritual life. 


Dead (vexpd). But the best texts read dpyn, idle; as of 
money which yields no interest, or of land lying fallow. 


21. When he had offered (avevéyxas). Incorrect. For the 
participle states the grownd of his justification. By works 
gives the general ground ; offered, etc., the specijic work. Com- 
pare Gen. xxii. 16, 17. Rev., correctly, in that he offered. 
The word dvevéyxas is, lit., brought wp to; and means, not 
actually to offer up in sacrifice (though Isaac was morally sacri- 
ficed in Abraham’s will), but to bring to the altar as an offering

93. Was fulfilled (érAnpaIn). Not was confirmed, which 
the word does not mean either in New-Testament or in classi- 
cal usage, but was actually and fully realized. James here 
uses the formula which in the Old Testament is employed of 
the realizing of a former utterance. See 1 Kings ii. 27; 2 
Chron. xxxvi. 22 (Sept.). 


Imputed (€doyicIn). Lit., as Rey., reckoned. 


He was called the friend of God. The term, however, 
does not occur either in the Hebrew or Septuagint, though it is 
found in the A. V. and retained in Rev. Old Testament. In 2 
Chron. xx. 7 (Sept.), thy friend is To Ayarnwev@ cou, thy be- 
loved. In Isa. xli. 8 (Sept.), my friend is bv yyarnoa, whom 
T loved. “The friend of God” is still the favorite title of 
Abraham among the Jews and Mohammedans. 


95. Rahab. Also referred to in Heb. xi. 31, among the ex- 
amples of faith. Dante places her in the third heaven: 


“ Thou fain wouldst know who is within this light 
That here beside me thus is scintillating, 
Even as a sunbeam in the limpid water. 
Then know thon, that within there is at rest 
Rahab, and being to our order joined, 
With her in its supremest grade ’tis sealed. 


First of Christ’s Triumph was she taken up. 

Full meet it was to leave her in some heaven, 
Even as a palm of the high victory 

Which he acquired with one palm and the other, 
Because she favored the first glorious deed 


Of Joshua upon the Holy Land.” 
Paradise, ix., 112-125. 


Rahab became the wife of Salmon, and the ancestress of Boaz, 
Jesse’s grandfather. Some have supposed that Salmon was 
one of the spies whose life she saved. At any rate, she be-

came the mother of the line of David and of Christ, and is so

Fierce (cxdnpav). More literally, and better, as Rev., rough. 
The word primarily means hard, harsh. 


Helm (anSanriov). Better, rudder, as Rev. The rudder was 
an oar worked by a handle. Helm and rudder were thus one. 
The word occurs only here and Acts Xxvii. 40. 


The governor listeth (4 opy tod eddivortos Bovnerat). 
Lit., the impulse or desire of the steersman wisheth. ‘Opp, 
impulse, only here and Acts xiv. 5, of an assault, onset. 


The governor (rod eiSivovtos). Rev., steersman. Lit., of 
him who is guiding. Only here and John i. 23. From edJds, 
straight. 


5. Boasteth great things (weyadavyet). The best texts 
separate the compound, and read peydra avyel, of course with 
the same meaning. Adye?, boasteth, only here in New Tes- 
tament. 


How great a matter a little fire kindleth (7Adkov zip 
arixny trv avarrer). The word bry (only here in New Tes- 
tament) means wood or a forest, and hence the matter or raw 
material of which a thing is made. Later, it is used in the 
philosophical sense of matter—“ the foundation of the mani- 
fold” —opposed to the intelligent or formative principle voids, 


748 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. III. 


mind. The authorized version has taken the word in one of its 
secondary senses, hardly the philosophical sense it would seem ; 
but any departure from the earlier sense was not only needless, 
but impaired the vividness of the figure, the familiar and nat- 
ural image of a forest on fire. So Homer: 


‘* As when a fire 
Seizes a thick-grown forest, and the wind 
Drives it along in eddies, while the trunks 
Fall with the boughs amid devouring flames.” 
Miad, xi., 155. 


Hence, Rev., rightly, “‘ Behold how much wood or how great a 
Sorest is kindled by how small a fire. 

This, too, is the rendering of the Vulgate: guam magnam 
silvam. 


6. World of iniquity («dopos tis aduxias). Koopos, prima- 
rily, means order, and is applied to the world or universe as 
an orderly system. A world of iniquity is an organism con- 
taining within itself all evil essence, which from it permeates 
the entire man. World is used in the same sense as in the lat- 
ter part of Prov. xvii. 6 (Sept.), which is not given in the 
A.V. “The trusty hath the whole world of things, but the 
faithless not a groat.” 


Is the tongue (ka¥icratat). This differs a little from the 
simple zs, though it is not easy to render it accurately. The 
verb means to appoint, establish, institute, and is used of the 
tongue as having an appointed and definite place in a system 
(among our members). It might be rendered hath dts place. 


Defileth (omAotca). Lit., defiling. Only here and Jude 
23. See on 2 Pet. ii. 13. 


Setteth on fire (proylfouca). Lit., setting on fire. Only in 
this verse in New Testament. 


The course of nature (tpoxov ris yevéoews). A very ob- 
scure passage. T'poyos (only here in New Testament), from 


Cu. IL] THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 749 


tpéxo, to rwn, applies generally to anything round or cireular 
which runs or rolls, as a wheel or sphere. Hence, often a 
wheel. Used of the circuit of fortifications and of circles or 
zones of land or sea. From the radical sense, to run, comes 
the meaning course, as the course of the sun; and from this a 
place for running, a race-course. Tevécews, rendered nature, 
means origin, beginning, birth, manner of birth, production, 
and is used by Plato for the creation, or the sum of created 
things. It also means a race, and a generation or age. In the 
New Testament it occurs but twice outside of this epistle, viz., 
at Matt. i. 1, “the book of the generation of Jesus Christ,” 
where the meaning is origin or birth ; the birth-book of Jesus 
Christ. The other passage is Matt. i: 18, according to the best 
texts, also meaning birth. In Jas. i. 23, as we have seen, 
mpocwroy Ths yevecens is the face of his birth. We may then 
safely translate tpoyds by wheel ; and as birth is the meaning 
of yéveous in every New-Testament passage where it occurs, we 
may give it the preference here and render the wheel of birth— 
i.e., the wheel which is set in motion at birth and runs on to 
the close of life. It is thus a figurative description of human 
life. So Anacreon: 


“The chariot-wheel, like life, runs rolling round.” 


Tertullian says: “The whole revolving wheel of existence bears 
witness to the resurrection of the dead.” The Rev., which 
gives nature, puts berth in margin. This revolving wheel is 
kindled by the tongue, and rolls on in destructive blaze. The 
image is justified by the fact. The tongue works the chief 
mischief, kindles the most baleful fires in the course of life. 


7. Kind (dors). Wrong. James is not speaking of the rela- 
tion between individual men and individual beasts, but of the 
relation between the nature of man and that of beasts, which 
may be different in different beasts. Hence, as Rev., in margin, 
nature. 


Beasts (Inpiwv). Quadrupeds. Not beasts generally, nor 
wild beasts only. In Acts xxviii. 4, 5, the word is used of the 


750 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. ILL. 


viper which fastened on Paul’s hand. In Peter’s vision (Acts 
x. 12; xi. 6) there is a different classification from the one here ; 
quadrupeds being denoted by a specific term, retpdzroda, four- 
footed creatures. There Inpia includes fishes, which in this 
passage are classed as évadtwn, things wn the sea. 


By mankind (79 ddces TH avIpwrivn). Rather, by the nat- 
wre of man, pbots, as before, denoting the generic character. 
Every nature of beasts is tamed by the nature of man. Com- 
pare the fine chorus in the “ Antigone” of Sophocles, 343-352: 


** The thoughtless tribe of birds, 
The beasts that roam the fields, 
The brood in sea-depths born, 
He takes them all in nets, 
Knotted in snaring mesh, 
Man, wonderful in skill. 
And by his subtle arts 
He holds in sway the beasts 
That roam the fields or tread the mountain’s height ; 
And brings the binding yoke 
Upon the neck of horse with shaggy mane, 
Or bull on mountain crest, 
Untamable in strength.” 


8. No man (ovdels dvdpwwv). A strong expression. Lit. 
no one of men. 


Unruly (axatdoyxerov). Lit., not to be held back. The proper 
reading, however, is akatdotatov, unsettled. See on xaSicrarat, 
hath cts place, ver. 6. Rev., correctly, restless. 


Deadly (Javarnpopov). Lit., death-bearing, or -bringing. 
Only here in New Testament. 


Poison (éod). Rendered rust at ch. v. 3; and found only in 
these two passages and in Rom. iii. 18, in the citation of Ps. 
exl. 3. 


9. God, even the Father (rov Ocdv cai warépa). The proper 
reading is tov Kupuov, the Lord, and the kal, and, is simply con- 


Cx. IIL] THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 751 


nective. Read, therefore, as Rev., the Lord and Father. This 
combination of terms for God is uncommon. See ch. i. 27. 


Which. Not who, which would designate personally certain 
men; whereas James designates them generically. 


11. Doth a fountain, etc. The interrogative particle, uyru, 
which begins the sentence, expects a negative answer. Foun- 
tain has the article, “‘ the fountain,” generic. See Introduction, 
on James’ local allusions. The Land of Promise was pictured 
to the Hebrew as a land of springs (Deut. viii. 7; xi. 11). 
“ Palestine,” says Dean Stanley, “was the only country where 
an Eastern could have been familiar with the language of the 
Psalmist: ‘ He sendeth the springs into the valleys which run 
among the mountains.’ Those springs, too, however short- 
lived, are remarkable for their copiousness and beauty. Not 
only not in the East, but hardly in the West, can any fountains 
and sources of streams be seen, so clear, so full-grown even at 
their birth, as those which fall into the Jordan and its lakes 
throughout its whole course from north to south” (“ Sinai and 
Palestine”). The Hebrew word for a fountain or spring is 
dyin, meaning an eye. “The spring,” says the same author, 
‘“‘is the bright, open source, the eye of the landscape.”* 


Send forth (pve). An expressive word, found nowhere 
else in the New Testament, and denoting a full, copious dis- 
charge. Primarily it means éo be full to bursting ; and is used, 
therefore, of budding plants, teeming soil, etc., as in the charm- 
ing picture of the sacred grove at the opening of the ‘‘Oedi- 
pus Coloneus” of Sophocles: “full (Bptwv) of bay, olive, and 
vine.” Hence, to burst forth or gush. Though generally in- 
transitive, it is used transitively here. 


Place (dmfs). Rather, opening or hole in the earth or rock. 
Rev., opening. Compare caves, Heb. xi. 38. The word is 
pleasantly suggestive in connection with the image of the eye of 
the landscape. See above. 





* See Scott's ‘‘ Castle Dangerous,” ch. i, 


752 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. III. 


Sweet water and bitter. The readers of the epistle would 
recall the bitter waters of Marah (Exod. xv. 23), and the un- 
wholesome spring at Jericho (2 Kings ii. 19-21). 


12. So can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. 
The best texts omit so can no fountain, and the and between 
salt and fresh. Thus the text reads, ovre GAVKOV YAVKV TroLhoat 
HSwp. Render, as Rev., neither can salt water yield sweet. An- 
other of James’ local allusions, salé waters. The Great Salt Sea 
was but sixteen miles from Jerusalem. Its shores were lined 
with salt-pits, to be filled when the spring freshets should raise 
the waters of the lake. A salt marsh also terminated the valley 
through which the Jordan flows from the Lake of Tiberias to 
the Dead Sea, and the adjoining plain was covered with salt 
streams and brackish springs. Warm springs impregnated with 
sulphur abound in the voleanic valley of the Jordan. “Advxov, 
salt, occurs only here in the New Testament. 


13. Wise and endued with knowledge (codds Kai émic- 
anv). A rendering needlessly verbose, yet substantially cor- 
rect. Probably no very nice distinction was intended by the 
writer. It is somewhat difficult to fix the precise sense of cogos, 
since there is no uniformity in its usage in the New Testament. 
In classical Greek it primarily means skilled in a handicrafé or 
art. Thence it runs into the sense of clever, in matters of com- 
mon life, worldly wise. Then, in the hands of the philosophers, 
it acquires the sense of learned in the sciences ; and, ironically, 
abstruse, subtle, obscure, like the English cwnning, which origi- 
nally meant knowing or skilful, and is often used in that sense 
in the English Bible (see Gen. xxv. 27; 1 Sam. xvi. 16). 

In the New Testament codds is used—1. In the original classi- 
cal sense, skilled in handicraft (1 Cor. iii. 10). 2. Accomplished 
in letters, learned (Rom. i. 14, 22; 1 Cor. i. 19, 26; iii. 18). 
So of the Jewish theologians and doctors (Matt. xi. 25), and of 
Christian teachers (Matt. xxiii. 34). 3. In a practical sense, 
of the practice of the law of piety and honesty; so Eph. v. 15, 
where it is joined with walking circumspectly, and 1 Cor. vi. 
5, where it is represented as the quality adapted to adjust differ- 


Cu. IIL] THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 753 


ences in the church. 4. In the higher, philosophical sense, of 
devising the best counsels and employing the best means to 
carry them out. So of God, Rom. xvi. 27; 1 Tim. i. 17; Jude 
25; 1 Cor. i. 25. In this passage the word appears to be used 
in the sense of 3: practical wisdom in pious living. 

’Emotijpev occurs only here in the New Testament. In clas 
sical Greek it is often used like codés, in the sense of skilled, 
versed ; and by the philosophers in the higher sense of scventy- 
cally versed, in which sense it is opposed by Plato to dofacrHs, 
a mere conjecturer. In this passage copds would seem to be 
the broader, more general, and perhaps more dignified term 
of the two, as denoting the habit or quality, while eTLOTHULOV 
indicates the special development and intelligent application 
of the quality to particular things. The Rev., wise and under- 
standing, gives the distinction, on the whole, as nearly as is 
necessary. 


Conversation (dvactpodijs). See on 1 Pet. i. 15. 


Meekness of wisdom. On meekness, see on Matt. v. 5. 
The meekness which is the proper attribute of wisdom. 


‘« Knowledge is proud that she has learned so much, 
Wisdom is humble that she knows no more.” 


14. Envying (&j\ov). The word is used in the New Testa- 
ment both in a bad and a good sense. For the latter, see John 
ii. 17; Rom. x. 2; 2 Cor. ix.2. From it is our word zeal, 
which may be either good or bad, wise or foolish. The bad 
sense is predominant in the New Testament. See Acts v. 17; 
Rom. xiii. 13; Gal. v. 20, and here, where the bad sense is de- 
fined and emphasized by the epithet better. It is often joined 
with épus, strife, as here with épidea, intriguing or faction. 
The rendering envying, as A. V., more properly belongs to 
@9évos, which is never used in a good sense. mulation is 
the better general rendering, which does not necessarily include 
envy, but may be full of the spirit of self-devotion. . Rev. ren- 
ders jealousy. 

38 


154 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. OL 


Strife (ép.9elav). A wrong rendering, founded on the mis- 
taken derivation from épus, strife. Itis derived from épivos, a 
hired servant, and means, primarily, labor for hire. Compare 
Tobit ii. 11: My wife did take women’s work to do (jpidevero). 
Thus it comes to be applied to those who serve in official 
positions for their own selfish interest, and who, to that end, 
promote party spirit and faction. So Rom. ii. 8: them that 
are contentious (€& épuSelas), lit., of faction. Rev., factrous. 
Also, 2 Cor. xii. 20. Rev., here, rightly, faction. 


15. Wisdom (codgia). See on codgos, ver. 13. 
From above. Compare ch. i. 17. 
Sensual (puyuxn). See on Jude 19. 


Devilish (Saruorwwdns). Or demoniacal, according to the 
proper rendering of Saiuev (see on Matt. iv. 1). Only here in 
New Testament. Devilish, “such,” says Bengel, “cas even 
devils have.” Compare ch. ii. 19. 


16. Confusion (dxatacracia). See on restless, ver. 8. 


Evil (¢addov). An inadequate rendering, because it fails to 
bring out the particular phase of evil which is dominant in the 
word : worthlessness, good-for-nothingness. In classical Greek 
it has the meanings slight, trivial, paltry, which run into bad. 
In the New Testament it appears in this latest stage, and is set 
over against good. See John iii. 20; v. 29; Tit. ii. 8. Rev., 
vile, which, according to its etymology, Lat., vies, follows the 
same process of development from cheap, or paltry, to bad. 


17. First. Emphasizing its inner quality, pure, as distin- 
guished from its outward expressions. The idea is not first 
numerically, but first essentcally. ‘The other qualities are sec: 
ondary as outgrowths of this primary quality. 


Gentle (émvevens). See on 1 Pet. ii. 18. 


Cu. IV.] THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 755 


Easy to be intreated (ed7eudys). Only here in New Testa- 
ment. 


Without partiality (adcaxpitos). Only here in New Testa- 
ment and very rare in classical Greek. Rev., without vari- 
ance or doubting. See on ch. i. 6. 


CHAPTER IV. 


1. Lusts (jSovdv). Lit., pleasures, as Rev. Properly, sen- 
sual pleasures. The sinful pleasures are the outgrowths of the 
lusts, ver. 2. 


That war (ctpatevopévwv). The thought of wars and fight- 
ings is carried into the figurative description of the sensuality 
which arrays its forces and carries on its campaign in the mem- 
bers. The verb does not imply mere fighting, but all that is 
included in military service. A remarkable parallel occurs in 
Plato, “Phaedo,” 66: “For whence come wars and fightings 
and factions? Whence but from the body and the lusts of the 
body?” Compare 1 Pet. ii. 11; Rom. vii. 23. 


2. Ye lust. See on desire, 1 Pet. i. 12; Mark iv. 19. 


Desire to have ({pdodre). Rev., covet, and are jealous, in 
margin. See on ch. iii. 14. 


3. Ve ask (aireire). See on jpdtar, besought, Matt. xv. 23. 


Amiss (caxds). Lit., evilly : with evil intent, as explained 
by the following sentence. 


Consume it upon (Sazravyonjre év). More correctly, as Rev., 
spend it in. The sense is not lay out expense upon your pleas- 


ures, but spend in the ewercise of; under the dominion of. 


4, Ye adulterers (uovyol). All the best texts omit. 


756 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IV. 


Adulteresses (uovyarides). The feminine term is the gen- 
eral designation of all whom James here rebukes. The apos- 
tate members of the church are figuratively regarded as un- 
faithful spouses ; according to the common Old-Testament fig- 
ure, in which God is the bridegroom or husband to whom his 
people are wedded. See Jer. iii. ; Hos. ii., iii., iv.; Isa. liv. 5; 
Ixii. 4, 5. Also, Matt. xii. 89; 2 Cor. xi. 25 A POC XIKoes

Will be (Bovdy 99 eivas). More correctly, as Rev., would be. 
Lit., may have been minded to be. 


Is the enemy (xaHorara). Thereby constitutes himself. 
Reyv., maketh himself. See on ch. iii. 6. 


5. Do ye think (Soxe@re). See on ch. i. 26. 


The scripture (1) ypad7). See on Mark xii. 10. Properly, 
a passage of scripture. 


In vain (evs). Only here in New Testament. 
6. Resisteth. See onl Pet. v. 5. 

Proud. See on Mark vii. 22. 

Humble. See on Matt. vii. 29. 


7. Submit yourselves (imordynte). Rev., be subject. The 
verb means to place or arrange under ; as resist (ver. 6) is to 
array against. God sets himself in array against the proud ; 
therefore, array yourselves under God, that ye may withstand 
the devil. 


8. Purify (ayvicare). One of the three instances in the New 
Testament in which the word is not used of ceremonial purifi- 
cation. The others are 1 Pet. i. 22; 1 John ii. 3. 


Double-minded (dapuyor). Compare ch. i. 8. 


Cu. IV.] THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 157 


9. Be afflicted (raxaurépycate). Only here in New Tes- 
tament. The kindred noun tadaurwpia, misery, occurs ch. v. 1. 


Mourn (evSijoare). Used of grief that is manifested. So 
mostly in New Testament, and very commonly joined, as here, 
with weep. So Mark xvi. 10; Luke vi. 25, etc. In the next 
sentence occurs the kindred noun 7év9os, mourning, into which 
laughter, also something manifest, is to be changed. 


Heaviness (xat/evav). Properly, a casting down of the 
eyes. Compare Luke xviii. 18. Only here in New Testa- 
ment. 


12. There is one lawgiver (eis éorlv o vomwoderns). The 
A. V. fails to note the emphatic position of one. Better, Rev., 
one only is the lawgiver. Nopodérns, lawgiver, only here in 
New Testament. 


But who art thou ? (od 8é ris ef). According to the Greek 
order: but thou, who art thou ? 


13. Go to now (dye viv). Go to is an obsolete phrase, 
though retained in Rev. Itisa formula for calling attention : 
come NOW. 


Such a city (r7v5e tiv od). More accurately, as Rev., 
this city. 


Continue there a year (sroujoopev éxel évvavTov). Lit., we 
will make a year. See, for the same form of expression, Acts 
xv. 33; xviii. 23; 2 Cor. xi. 25. Better, as Rev., spend a year 
there. (Compare the A. V., Acts xviii. 23, rightly retained by 
Rev.) The word soujoopev implies more than mere con- 
tinwance ; rather, a doing something with the year. 


And. The frequent use of the copulative gives a lively tone 
to the passage, expressive of the lightness and thoughtlessness 
of a careless spirit. 


758 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IV. 


Buy and sell (éuropevodpeda). Rev., more concisely, trade. 
Only here and 2 Pet. ii. 3. 


14. Whereas ye know not (oftuves ov« érictacde). The 
pronoun marking a class, as being of those who know not. 


What shall be on the morrow (ro tis avpiov). Lit., the 
thing of the morrow. The texts vary. Westcott and Hort 
read, Ye know not what your life shall be on the morrow, for 
ye area vapor: thus throwing out the question. 


What is your life? (ola). Lit., of what kind or nature. 


It is even a vapor (atpls ydp éotwv). But all the best texts 
read éore, ye are. So Rev., which, however, retains the ques- 
tion, what is your life ? 


Appeareth—vanisheth. Both participles, appearing, van- 
ishing. 


And then (éze:ta xal). The «al placed after the adverb 
then is not copulatwe, but expresses that the vapor vanishes even 
as it appeared. 


15. For that ye ought to say (avti Tod Aéyew duds). Ver. 
14 was parenthetical, so that at this point the thought is taken 
up from ver.13: Yewho say we will go, ete.—for that ye ought 
to say. The rendering in margin of Rev. is simpler: instead 


of your saying. 
16. Ve rejoice (cavyace). Rev., glory. See on ch. ii. 13. 


Boastings (aXafovelaus). Only here and 1 John ii. 16. The 
kindred word dAalov, a boaster, is derived from d\n, a@ wan- 
dering or roaming ; hence, primarily, a vagabond, a quack, a 
mountebank. From the empty boasts of such concerning the 
cures and wonders they could perform, the word passed into 
the sense of boaster. One may boast truthfully ; but arafovela 


Ox. V.] THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 759 


is false and swaggering boasting. Rev. renders vauntings, and 
rightly, since vaunt is from the Latin vanus, empty, and there- 
fore expresses ¢dle or vain boasting. 


CHAPTER '¥V. 
1. Goto. See on ch. iv. 13. 


Weep and howl («ravcare drodvfovtes). Lit., weep, how!- 
ing. The latter is a descriptive word, ol-ol-uz-o. Only here in 
New Testament, and denoting a more demonstrative and pas- 
sionate expression of grief than weeping. 


Miseries (radavrwplais). Only here and Rom. iii.16. See 
on be afflicted, ch. iv. 9. 


That shall come upon (érrepyouévais). Present participle. 
More correctly, as Rev., that are coming. 


9. Are corrupted (céon7ev). Only here in New Testament. 


Are moth-eaten (onrdBpwta yéyovev). Lit., have become 
moth-eaten. Only here in New Testament, but compare oxwd7- 
K6Bpwros, eaten of worms, Acts xii. 23; and see Matt. vi. 19, 20. 


3. is cankered (xatiwras). Only here in New Testament, 
from ids, rust, as in the following sentence. Also poison, as 
ch. iii. 8. The preposition card indicates thoroughness, com- 
pletely rusted. 


Flesh (tas cdpxas). The noun is plural: the fleshy parts of 
the body. So Sept. (2 Kings ix. 36): “the flesh (ras odpKas) 
of Jezebel.” So Apoc. xix. 18. 


4. Reaped down (aynodvrov). Only here in New Tes- 
tament. The primary meaning is to reap corn ; also in classical 
Greek of mowing down in battle. The secondary, which some 


760 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. V. 


mistake for the primary sense, is to gather, as for harvest. 
Rey., mowed. 


Fields (xépas). The more general word, place, for aypos, the 
ordinary word for a field ; though the usage is warranted by 
classical Greek, and occurs Luke xii. 16; John iv. 35, the only 
two instances besides this in the New Testament. It implies a 
larger tract than dypos, as is evident in all the New-Testament 
passages cited. In two cases it refers to a rich man’s estates; 
and in John iv. 35, the Lord directs the attention of the disci- 
ples to a broad area or series of fields. 


Crieth (xpd%v). An inarticulate cry. Compare Gen. iv. 10. 


Lord of Sabaoth. Lord of hosts. The only instance in 
which the phrase is used by a New-Testament writer. Rom. 
ix. 29, is quoted from Isa. i. 9. 


5. Ve have lived in pleasure (étpugyjcare). Only here in 
New Testament. See on 2 Pet. ii. 18, on the kindred noun 
tpudy, riot or revel. Rev., ye have lived delicately. 


Been wanton (éo7atadyoate). Only here and 1 Tim. v. 6. 
"Erpudjcate denotes dainty living: this word, dwaurious or 
prodigal living. Rev., taken your pleasure, is colorless, and is 
no improvement on the A. V. 


As in a day of slaughter (as év juépa ofayjs). All the 
best texts reject @s, as. The meaning of the passage is dis- 
puted. Some find the key to it in the words last days (ver. 3). 
The phrase day of slaughter is used for a day of judgment, Jer. 
xii. 3; xxv. 34 (Sept.). According to this, the meaning is, 
the day of judgment, at the supposed near coming of Christ. 
Others explain that these men are like beasts, which, on the 
very day of their slaughter, gorge themselves in unconscious 
security. 


7. Be patient (waxpodvuyncate). From paxpds, long, and 
Suds, soul or spirit, but with the sense of strong passion, 


Cu. V.] THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 761 


stronger even than dépy7j, anger, as is maintained by Schmidt 
(“ Synonymik ”), who describes Supuds as a tumultuous welling 
up of the whole spirit ; a mighty emotion which seizes and 
moves the whole inner man. Hence the restraint implied in 
paxpoSupta is most correctly expressed by long-suffering, which 
is its usual rendering in the New Testament. It is a patient 
holding out under trial; a long-protracted restraint of the soul 
from yielding to passion, especially the passion of anger. In 
the New Testament the word and its cognates are sometimes 
rendered by patient or patience, which conceals the distinction 
from drrowovn, uniformly rendered patience, and signifying per- 
sistent endurance, whether in action or suffering. As Trench 
observes, “ dmopovn is perseverantia and patientia both in one.” 
Thus Bishop Ellicott: “The brave patience with which the 
Christian contends against the various hindrances, persecutions, 
and temptations that befall him in his conflict with the inward 
and outward world.” ‘Yzopovy contains an element of manli- 
ness. Thus Plato joins it with the adverb avdpixds, in a manly 
way, and contrasts it with avdvipes, unmanly, cowardly. Max- 
poduptla is exercised toward persons ; itrouovn, toward thongs. 
The former is ascribed to God as an attribute (Luke xviii. (Orn: 
Pet. iii. 20; 2 Pet. iii. 9,15), the latter never; for the God of 
patience (Rom. xv. 5) is the God who imparts patience to his 
children. “There can be no resistance to God nor burden upon 
him, the Almighty, from things. Therefore diropovn cannot 
find place in him” (Trench). Rev. retains A. V., be patient. 
The thought links itself naturally with that in the preceding 
verse: the righteous doth not resist. 


Therefore. Since thingsare so. Referring to the condition 
of things described in the previous passage. 


Brethren. In contrast with the rich just addressed. 


Waiteth (éxdéyeras). With expectation. Compare Matt. xiii. 
30; Mark iv. 27. 


The early and latter rain (berdv mpoipor Kat dxfyov). Both 
adjectives only here in New Testament. ‘Terov, rain, is rejected 


"762 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu V. 


by all the best texts. The early rain fell in October, Novem- 
ber, and December, and extended into January and February. 
These rains do not come suddenly, but by degrees, so that the 
farmer can sow his wheat or barley. The rains are mostly from 
the west or southwest (Luke xii. 54), continuing two or three 
days at a time, and falling mostly in the night. Then the wind 
shifts to the north or east, and fine weather ensues (Prov. 
xxv. 28). The latter rains, which are much lighter, fall in 
March and April. Rain in harvest was regarded as a miracle 
(1, Sam. xii. 16-18). See Introduction, on James’ local allu- 
sions. 


9. Grudge not (u orevdfere). Better, as Rev., murmur 
not. The verb means to sigh or groan. 


Standeth before the doors. In the act of entering. 
10. Example (isrdderyua). See on 2 Pet. ii. 6. 


Of suffering affliction (caxomaJeias). Only here in New 
Testament. The word does not mean the endurance of afilic- 
tion, but affdction itself. Hence, Rev., rightly, suffering. 


The prophets. Compare Matt. v. 12. 


11. Endure (u7rouévovtas). Present participle. But the 
later texts read Urowewartas, the aorist participle, which en- 
dured ; referring to the prophets in the past ages. So Rev. 
On endured and patience, see on ver. 7. 


The end of the Lord (70 tédos xupiov). A peculiar ex- 
pression. The happy conclusion to which God brought Job’s 
trials. 


Very pitiful and of tender mercy (croAvomAayyvos Kal oix- 
tipyov). The former adjective only here in New Testament; 
the latter here and Luke vi. 36.  Rev., full of pity and merei- 
ful. Todvordayxves is from modvs, much, and omdayyva, the 


Cu. V.] THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 763 


nobler entrails, used like our heart, as the seat of the emotions. 
Hence the term bowels in the A. V. (Philip. i. 8; Col. ili. 12, 
etc.). Compare evoTAayxvor, tender-hearted, Eph. iv. 32. The 
distinction between this and oderippwv, merciful, seems to be 
that the former denotes the general quality of compassion, while 
the latter emphasizes the sympathy called out by special cases, 
being the feeling which is moved to pain at another’s suffering. 


12. Any other oath. See the common formulas of swear- 
ing, Matt. v. 35, 36. 


13. Is afflicted (xaxo7a%e?). See on the kindred word xaxo- 
rdSeva, suffering, ver. 10. Only here and 2 Tim. ii. 3, 9; iv. 5. 


Let him sing psalms (yaddérw). The word means, pri- 
marily, to pluck or twitch. Hence of the sharp twang on a bow- 
string or harp-string, and so to play upon a stringed instru- 
ment. Our word psalm, derived from this, is, properly, a tune 
played upon a stringed instrument. The verb, however, is used 
in the New Testament of singing praise generally. See 1 Cor. 
xiv. 15; Rom. xv. 9. 


15. The sick (tov xduvovta). Rev. gives, better, the parti- 
cipial force, him that is sick. The word originally means ¢o 
work. THence, “him that is laboring under disease.” 


And if he have committed sins («dv duaptias 1 Terot- 
nxos). The Greek gives a shade of meaning which can hardly 
be transferred neatly into English, representing not merely the 
fact that the man has sinned, but his condition as a sinner. 
Literally the words read, if he be having committed sins; Le., 
in a state of having committed, and under the moral or physical 
consequences of transgression. 


They shall be forgiven (apeIjceras). Better, Rev., “ 2 
shall be forgiven,” supplying the commission as a subject. The 
verb means to send forth or discharge, and is the standard New- 
Testament word for forgiving. Forgiveness (deus) is a put- 
ting or sending away of sins, with a consequent discharge of 


764 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. V. 


the sinner; thus differing from wdpeous (Rom. ili. 25), which is 
a passing by of sin, a pretermission as distinguished from a 7e- 
mission. See, farther, on Rom. ili. 25. 


16. Confess (é£ouoroyeioIe). The preposition é€, forth, 
out, implies full, frank, open confession, and so in every case of 
its use in the New Testament. See on Matt. iii. 6. 


Faults (waparta@pata). See on Matt. vi. 14. 


The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man avail- 
eth much (ond ioyver Sénous Sixalov évepyoupévn). Lit., much 
availeth (toxder, is strong), the prayer of a righteous man work- 
ing or operating. The rendering of the A. V., besides being 
unwarranted by the text, is almost a truism. An effectual 
prayer is a prayer that avails. The Rev. is at once more cor- 
rect and more natural: Zhe supplication of a righteous man 
availeth much in its working. 


17. A man (dv$pw7os). The generic word; human like 
ourselves, this thought being emphasized by the succeeding 
epithet 0f like passions. See the same expression, Acts xiv. 15. 


Of like passions (6jovo7aJis). Only here and Acts xiv. 15. 
There is some danger of a misunderstanding of this rendering, 
from the limited and generally bad sense in which the word 
passions is popularly used. The meaning is rather of like 
nature and constitution. Rev. puts nature in margin, which 
would be better in the text. 


He prayed fervently (apocevy} mpoonvEato). Lit., he 
prayed with prayer. See a similar mode of expression, Gen. 
ii. 17 (Sept.), ye shall surely die (Savat@ arrodavetade) ; lit., ye 
shall die with death. Compare Luke xxii. 15; John iii. 29; 
Acts iv. 17. The addition of the cognate noun gives intense- 
ness to the verb. 


Hide—sins. A familiar Hebrew phrase. See Ps. xxxii. 1; 
igxky 20 roy. xc ae

ADDITIONAL NOTE. 


After the sheets of the three Gospels and the Acts had been printed, 
a careful revision of the lists of words peculiar to individual writers, and 
further examination of the various readings, revealed a number of omis- 
sions and errors. The lists are corrected in the following additional 
tables. 

I take this opportunity of expressing my great indebtedness to the 
careful and exhaustive lists in Dr. Joseph H. Thayer’s admirable lexi- 
con, recently published. I only wish that I could have had the benefit 
of it in the preparation of the entire volume.
