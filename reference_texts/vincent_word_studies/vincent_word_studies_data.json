As compared with men, in conduct they are gen- erally characterized by superior force and intellect, but by infe- rior morality.”  In its peculiar application to the dead, there is indicated the despair of earthly happiness underlying the thought of even the cheerful and mercurial Greek. Hence the word was used as synonymous with dead. Only the dead could be called truly blessed. Thus Sophocles (“ Cidipus Tyrannus”) :   ‘¢ From hence the lesson learn ye To reckon no man happy till ye witness The closing day ; until he pass the border Which severs life from death, unscathed by sorrow.”   And again (“ Gidipus at Colonus ”) :   ‘‘ Happiest beyond compare, Never to taste of life : Happiest in order next, Being born, with quickest speed Thither again to turn From whence we came.”   Nevertheless, even in its pagan use, the word was not alto- gether without a moral background. The Greeks recognized a prosperity which waited on the observance of the laws of natu- ral morality, and an avenging Fate which pursued and punished their violation. This conception appears often in the works of the tragedians ; for instance, in the “(idipus Tyrannus” of Sophocles, where the main motive is the judgment which waits upon even unwitting violations of natural ties. Still, this prosperity is external, consisting either in wealth, or power, or exemption from calamity.  With the philosophers a moral element comes definitely into the word. ‘The conception rises from outward propriety to in- ward correctness as the essence of happiness. But in all of them, from Socrates onward, virtue depends primarily upon knowledge ; so that to be happy is, first of all, to know. It is thus apparent that the Greek philosophy had no conception of sim in the Bible sense. As virtue depended on knowledge, sin was the outcome of ignorance, and virtue and its consequent   Cu. V.] MATTHEW. 35   happiness were therefore the prerogative of the fewand the learned.  The biblical use of the word lifted it into the region of the spiritual, as distinguished from the merely intellectual, and be- sides, intrusted to it alone the task of representing this higher conception. The pagan word for happiness (evda.povia, under the protection of a good genius or daemon) nowhere occurs in the New Testament nor in the Scriptures, having fallen into disrepute because the word daemon, which originally meant a deity, good or evil, had acquired among the Jews the bad sense which we attach to demon. Happiness, or better, blessedness, was therefore represented both in the Old and in the New Testa- ment by this word paxdpws. In the Old Testament the idea involves more of outward prosperity than in the New Testa- ment, yet it almost universally occurs in connections which emphasize, as its principal element, a sense of God’s approval founded in righteousness which rests ultimately on love to God.  Thus the word passed up into the higher region of Christian thought, and was stamped with the gospel signet, and laden with all the rich significance of gospel blessedness. It now takes on a group of ideas strange to the best pagan morality, and contradictory of its fundamental positions. Shaking itself loose from all thoughts of outward good, it becomes the express symbol of a happiness identified with pure character. Behind it lies the clear cognition of sin as the fountain-head of all misery, and of holiness as the final and effectual cure for every woe. For knowledge as the basis of virtue, and therefore of happi- ness, it substitutes faith and love. For the aristocracy of the learned virtuous, it introduces the truth of the Fatherhood of God and the corollary of the family of believers. While the pagan word carries the isolation of the virtuous and the con- traction of human sympathy, the Gospel pushes these out with an ideal of a world-wide sympathy and of a happiness realized in ministry. The vague outlines of an abstract good vanish from it, and give place to the pure heart’s vision of God, and its personal communion with the Father in heaven. Where it told of the Stoic’s self-sufficiency, it now tells of the Christian’s poverty of spirit and meekness. Where it hinted at the Stoic’s   36 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. V.   self-repression and strangling of emotion, it now throbs with a holy sensitiveness, and with a monition to rejoice with them that rejoice, and to weep with them that weep. From the pagan word the flavor of immortality is absent. No vision of abiding rest imparts patience and courage amid the bitterness and struggle of life; no menace of the destiny of evil imposes a check on human lusts. The Christian word ddessed is full of the light of heaven. It sternly throws away from itself every hint of the Stoic’s asserted right of suicide as a refuge from human ills, and emphasizes something which thrives on trial and persecution, which glories in tribulation, which not only endures but conquers the world, and expects its crown in heaven.   The poor (oi 7rwyol). Three words expressing poverty are found in the New Testament. Two of them, wévys and 7zrev- xpos, are kindred terms, the latter being merely a poetic form of the other, and neither of these occurs more than once (Luke xxi. 2; 2 Cor. ix. 9). The word used in this verse is therefore the current word for poor, occurring thirty-four times, and cov- ering every gradation of want; so that it is evident that the New Testament writers did not recognize any nice distinctions of meaning which called for the use of other terms. Luke, for instance (xxi. 2, 3), calls the widow who bestowed her two mites both arevypav and mtwy7). Nevertheless, there is a dis- tinction, recognized by both classical and ecclesiastical writers. While o zévys is one of narrow means, one who “ earns a scanty pittance,” wTwyos is allied to the verb rrdéocew, to crouch or cringe, and therefore conveys the idea of wdéter destitution, which abjectly solicits and lives by alms. Hence it is applied to Lazarus (Luke xvi. 20, 22), and rendered beggar. Thus dis- tinguished, it is very graphic and appropriate here, as denoting the utter spiritual destitution, the consciousness of which pre- cedes the entrance into the kingdom of God, and which cannot be relieved by one’s own efforts, but only by the free mercy of God. (See on 2 Cor. vi. 103; viii. 9.)   4. They that mourn (ev9obvtes). Signifying grief mani- ested; too deep for concealment. Hence it is often joined with Kralew, to weep audibly (Mark xvi. 10; James iv. 9).   Cu. V.) MATTHEW. 37   Shall be comforted. See on John xiv. 16.   5. The meek (oi zpaets). Another word which, though never used in a bad sense, Christianity has lifted to a higher plane, and made the symbol of a higher good. Its primary meaning is mild, gentle. It was applied to inanimate things, as light, wind, sound, sickness. It was used of a horse ; gentle.  As a human attribute, Aristotle defines it as the mean between stubborn anger and that negativeness of character which is in- capable of even righteous indignation : according to which it is tantamount to eguanimity. Plato opposes it to fierceness or cruelty, and uses it of humanity to the condemned ; but also of the conciliatory demeanor of a demagogue seeking popularity and power. Pindar applies it to a king, med or kind to the citizens, and Herodotus uses it as opposed to anger.  These pre-Christian meanings of the word exhibit two general characteristics. 1. They express outward conduct merely. 2. They contemplate relations to men only. The Christian word, on the contrary, describes an inward quality, and that as re- lated primarily to God. The equanimity, mildness, kindness, represented by the classical word, are founded in self-control or in natural disposition. The Christian meekness is based on humility, which is not a natural quality but an outgrowth of a renewed nature. To the pagan the word often implied conde- scension, to the Christian it implies submission. The Chris- tian quality, in its manifestation, reveals all that was best in the heathen virtue—mildness, gentleness, equanimity—but these manifestations toward men are emphasized as outgrowths of a spiritual relation to God. The mildness or kindness of Plato or Pindar imply no sense of inferiority in those who exhibit them ; sometimes the contrary. Plato’s demagogue is kindly from self-interest and as a means to tyranny. Pindar’s king is condescendingly kind. The meekness of the Christian springs from a sense of the inferiority of the creature to the Creator, and especially of the sinful creature to the holy God. While, therefore, the pagan quality is redolent of sef-assertion, the Christian quality carries the flavor of sef-abasement. As to- ward God, therefore, meekness accepts his dealings without   38 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. V.   murmur or resistance as absolutely good and wise. As toward man, it accepts opposition, insult, and provocation, as God’s per- mitted ministers of a chastening demanded by the infirmity and corruption of sin; while, under this sense of his own sinfulness, the meek bears patiently “the contradiction of sinners against himself,” forgiving and restoring the erring in a spirit of meek- ness, considering himself, lest he also be tempted (see Gal. vi. 1-5). The ideas of forgiveness and restoration nowhere attach to the classical word. They belong exclusively to Christian meekness, which thus shows itself allied to love. As ascribed by our Lord to himself, see on Matt, xi. 29, Wye. renders “ Blessed be m/d men.”   6. Shall be filled (yopracIjcovta). A very strong and graphic word, originally applied to the feeding and fattening of animals in a stall. In Apoc. xix. 21, it is used of the filling of the birds with the flesh of God’s enemies. Also of the mul- titudes fed with the loaves and fishes (Matt. xiv. 20; Mark viii. 8; Luke ix. 17). It is manifestly appropriate here as express- ing the complete satisfaction of spiritual hunger and thirst. Hence Wycliffe’s rendering, fuljilled, is strictly true to the orig- inal.   7. The merciful. See on Luke i. 50.   9. The peacemakers (0: eipnvo7roio/). Should be held to its literal meaning, peace-makers ; not as Wyc., peaceable men. The founders and promoters of peace are meant ; who not only keep the peace, but seek to bring men into harmony with each other. Tynd. renders, the maintainers of peace.   13. Have lost his savour (uwpavd7). The kindred noun (uwpos) means dull, sluggish ; applied to the mind, stupid or silly ; applied to the taste, insipid, flat. The verb here used of salt, to become insipid, also means to play the fool. Our Lord refers here to the familiar fact of salt losing its pungency and becoming useless. Dr. Thompson (“The Land and the Book”) cites the following case: “ A merchant of Sidon, having   Cu. V.] MATTHEW. 39   farmed of the government the revenue from the importation of salt, brought over a great quantity from the marshes of Cyprus —enough, in fact, to supply the whole province for many years. This he had transferred to the mountains, to cheat the govern- ment out of some small percentage of duty. Sixty-five houses were rented and filled with salt. Such houses have merely earthen floors, and the salt next the ground was in a few years entirely spoiled. I saw large quantities of it literally thrown into the road to be trodden under foot of men and beasts. It was ‘ good for nothing.’ ”   15. A bushel (rdv pddiov). Rev., rightly, “the bushel ;” since the definite article is designed to indicate a familiar ob- ject—the grain-measure which is found in every house.   A candlestick (rv Xvyviav). Reyv., the stand. Also a part of the furniture of every house, and commonly but one in the house: hence the article. The word, which occurs four times in the Gospels and eight times elsewhere, means, in every case, not a candlestick, but a lamp-stand. In Heb. ix. 2, the golden “ candlestick” of the tabernacle is called Avyvia; but in the description of this article (Exod. xxv. 31, 39), we read, “Thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof ;” and in Zech. iv. 2, where the imagery is drawn from the sanctuary, we have a “ candle- stick ” with a bowl on the top of it, “ and his seven lamps there- on, and seven pipes (for the oil) to the lamps which are upon the top thereof.”   16. So shine (otrms). Often misconceived, as if the mean- ing were, “ Let your light shine in such a way that men may see,” etc. Standing at the beginning of the sentence, it points back to the illustration just used. “ So,” even as that lamp just mentioned, let your light shine. Wycliffe has apparently caught this correct sense: So shine your light before men.   17. To destroy (xatadicar). Lit., to loosen down, dissolve ; Wyc., undo.   40 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu V.   18. Jot, tittle (‘é7a, xepaia). Jot is for jod, the smallest let- ter in the Hebrew alphabet. ttle is the little bend or point which serves to distinguish certain Hebrew letters of similar appearance. Jewish tradition mentions the letter jod as being irremovable; adding that, if all men in the world were gathered to abolish the least letter in the law, they would not succeed. The guilt of changing those little hooks which distinguish be- tween certain Hebrew letters is declared to be so great that, if such a thing were done, the world would be destroyed.   22. Hell-fire (rv yéevvav tod wrupéds). Rev., more accurately, the hell of fire. The word Gehenna, rendered hell, occurs out- side of the Gospels only at James iii. 6. It is the Greek repre- sentative of the Hebrew Ge-Hinnom, or Valley of Hinnom, a deep, narrow glen to the south of Jerusalem, where, after the introduction of the worship of the fire-gods by Ahaz, the idola- trous Jews sacrificed their children to Molech. Josiah formally desecrated it, “that no man might make his son or his daugh- ter pass through the fire to Molech ” (2 Kings xxiii. 10). After this it became the common refuse-place of the city, into which the bodies of criminals, carcasses of animals, and all sorts of filth were cast. From its depth and narrowness, and its fire and ascending smoke, it became the symbol of the place of the future punishment of the wicked. So Milton:   “The pleasant valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence And black Gehenna called, the type of hell.”   As fire was the characteristic of the place, it was called the Gehenna of fire. It should be carefully distinguished from Hades (dns), which is never used for the place of punishment, but for the place of departed spirits, without reference to their moral condition. This distinction, ignored by the A. V., is made in the Rey.   25. Agree with (’a9: edvodv). Lit., be well-minded towards : inclined to satisfy by paying or compromising. Wyc., Be thou consenting to.   Cu. V.] MATTHEW. 4l   Officer (imnpérn). Denoting a subordinate official, as a herald or an orderly, and in this sense applied to Mark as the “minister” or attendant of Paul and Barnabas (Acts xiii. 5). It furnishes an interesting instance of the expansion of a word from a limited and special meaning into a more general one; and also of the influence of the Gospel in lifting words into higher and purer associations. Formed with the verb épécca, to row, it originally signified a@ rower, as distinguished from a soldier, in a war-galley. This word for a gadley-slave comes at last, in the hands of Luke and Paul, to stand for the noblest of all offices, that of a minister of the Lord Jesus (Luke i. 2; Acts xxvi. 16; 1 Cor. iv. 1).   29. Offend (cxavdarife). The word offend carries to the English reader the sense of giving offence, provoking. Hence the Rev., by restoring the picture in the word, restores its true meaning, causeth to stumble. The kindred noun is cxavéaror, a later form of cxavdddnYpor, the stick in a trap on which the bait is placed, and which springs up and shuts the trap at the touch of ananimal. Hence, generally, a snare, a stumbling-block. Christ’s meaning here is: “If your eye or your hand serve as an obstacle or trap to ensnare or make you fall in your moral walk.” How the eye might do this may be seen in the pre- vious verse. Bengel observes: ‘‘ He who, when his eye proves a stumbling-block, takes care not to see, does in reality blind himself.” The words scandal and slander are both derived from oxdvdanrov ; and Wye. renders, “If thy right eye slander thee.” Compare Aischylus, “ Choephori,” 301, 372.   40. Coat, cloke (yurava, iwdrtiov). The former, the shirt- like under-garment or tunic; the latter, the mantle, or ampler over-garment, which served as a covering for the night, and therefore was forbidden by the Levitical law to be retained in pledge over night (Exod. xxii. 26, 27). To yield up this with- out resistance therefore implies a higher degree of concession.   41. Shall compel thee to go (ayyapetce). This word throws the whole injunction into a picture which is entirely lost   4Z WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VL   to the English reader. A man is travelling, and about to pass a post-station, where horses and messengers are kept in order to forward royal missives as quickly as possible. An official rushes out, seizes him, and forces him to go back and carry a letter to the next station, perhaps to the great detriment of his business. The word is of Persian origin, and denotes the impressment into service, which officials were empowered to make of any available persons or beasts on the great lines of road where the royal mails were carried by relays of riders.   42. Borrow (Savicac3ar). Properly, to borrow at interest.   43. Neighbor (rév wAnciov). Another word to which the Gospel has imparted a broader and deeper sense. Literally it means the one near (so the Eng., neighbor = nigh-bor), indicat- ing a mere outward nearness, proximity. Thus a neighbor might be anenemy. Socrates (Plato, “ Republic,” ii., 373) shows how two adjoining states might come to want each a piece of its neighbor’s (rév wAnoiov) land, so that there would arise war between them; and again (Plato, “'Theaetetus,” 174) he says that a philosopher is wholly unacquainted with his next-door neighbor, and does not know whether he is a man or an animal. The Old Testament expands the meaning to cover national or tribal fellowship, and that is the sense in our Lord’s quotation here. The Christian sense is expounded by Jesus in the para- ble of the Good Samaritan (Luke x. 29 sqq.), as including the whole brotherhood of man, and as founded in love for man, as man, everywhere.  ",

Small pearls, called by jewellers seed-pearls, would resemble the pease or maize on which the swine feed. They would rush upon them when scattered, and, discovering the cheat, would trample upon them and turn their tusks upon the man who scattered them.   Turn (crpadévtes). The Rev. properly omits again. The word graphically pictures the quick, sharp turn of the boar.   Rend (p7€wouv). Lit., break ; and well chosen to express the peculiar character of the wound made by the boar’s tusk, which is not a cut, but a long tear or rip.   9. Bread, a stone (dprov, Xi9ov). Rev. for bread reads loaf, which is better. On the resemblance of certain stones to cakes of bread, see on Matt. iv. 3.   13. Strait gate (ctevjs mvAns). Rev., narrow. A remark- able parallel to this passage occurs in the “ Pinax” or “ Tablet” of Cebes, a writer contemporary with Socrates. In this, human life, with its dangers and temptations, is symbolically repre- sented as on a tablet. The passage is as follows: “ Seest thou not, then, a little door, and a way before the door, which is not much crowded, but very few travel it? This is the way which leadeth into true culture.”   Leadeth (amrdyouca). Lit., leadeth away, from death, or, perhaps, from the broad road. Note that the gate is not at the end, but at the beginning of the road.   16. Ye shall know (ésruyvécecde). The compound verb in- dicates full knowledge. Character is satisfactorily tested by its fruits.   22. Have we not (ov). That form of the negative is used which expects an affirmative answer. It therefore pictures both the self-conceit and the self-deception of these persons. “Surely we have prophesied,” ete.   Cu. VIL.) MATTHEW. 51   23. Profess (ouoroynow). The word which is used elsewhere of open confession of Christ before men (Matt. x. 32; Rom. x. 9); of John’s public declaration that he was not the Christ (John i. 20); of Herod’s promise to Salome in the presence of his guests (Matt. xiv. 7). Here, therefore, of Christ’s open, public declaration as Judge of the world. “There is great authority in this saying,” remarks Bengel.   24 sqq. | will liken him, etc. The picture is not of two men deliberately selecting foundations, but it contrasts one who carefully chooses and prepares his foundation with one who builds at hap-hazard. This is more strongly brought ont by Luke (vi. 48): “Who digged and went deep, and laid a founda- tion upon the rock” (Reyv.). Kitto (“ Pictorial Bible”) says: “ At this very day the mode of building in Christ’s own town of Nazareth suggests the source of this image. Dr. Robinson was entertained in the house of a Greek Arab. The house had just been built, and was not yet finished. In order to lay the foundations he had dug down to the solid rock, as is usual throughout the country here, to the depth of thirty feet, and then built up arches.” The abrupt style of ver. 25 pictures the sudden coming of the storm which sweeps away the house on the sand: “ Descended the rain, and came the floods, and blew the winds.”   27. Great was the fall of it. The conclusion of the Sermon on the Mount. “Thus,” remarks Bengel, “it is not necessary for every sermon to end with consolation.”   28. Were astonished (é£emdjccovro). From éx, out of, and mAjocw, to strike. Often to drive one out of his senses by a sudden shock, and therefore here of amazement. They were astounded. We have a similar expression, though not so strong : “T was struck with this or that remarkable thing.”   29. He taught (%v diddcxwv). He was teaching. This union of the verb and participle emphasizes the idea of dura- tion or habit more than the simple tense.   52 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Oa. VIIL   OHAPTER. VILL   6. Tormented (Bacavifouevos). See on torments, Matt. iv. 24.   7. Heal (Separevow). So A. V. and Rev. The word, how- ever, originally means ¢o attend, and to treat medically. The centurion uses another and stronger word, shall be healed (taSjcerat). Luke, who as a physician is precise in the use of medical terms, uses both words in one verse (ix. 11). Jesus healed (taro) all who had need of treatment (Separreias). Still, Luke himself does not always observe the distinction. See on Luke v. 15.   9. Also («al). Omitted in A. V., but very important. sal also am a man under authority,” as well as thou. (Tynd., I also myself). The centurion compares the Lord’s position with his own. Christ had authority over disease. The centu- rion also was in authority over soldiers. As the centurion had only to say toa soldier “Go!” and he went, so Christ had only to say to disease “Go!” and it would obey him.   11. Shall sit down (dvaxrIjcovtat). Lit., recline. The pict- ure is that of a banquet. Jews as well as Romans reclined at table on couches.   12. The outer (rd é£drepov). The Greek order of words is very forcible. “They shall be cast forth into the darkness, the outer (darkness). The picture is of an illuminated banquet- ing chamber, owts¢de of which is the thick darkness of night.   13. Was healed (/é9y). Note that the stronger word of the centurion (ver. 8) is used here. Where Christ tends, he heals.   14, Sick of a fever (aupéccovcav). Derived from sip, fire. Our word fever comes through the German fewer.   Cu. VIII.) MATTHEW. 53   17. Bare (é8doracev). This translation is correct. The word does not mean “he took away,” but “he bore,” as a bur- den laid upon him. This passage is the corner-stone of the faith-cure theory, which claims that the atonement of Christ includes provision for bodily no less than for spiritual healing, and therefore insists on translating “took away.” Matthew may be presumed to have understood the sense of the passage he was citing from Isaiah, and he could have used no word more inadequate to express his meaning, if that meaning had been that Christ took away infirmities.   20. Holes (dwdecovs). Wye. has ditches, with burrows in ex- planation.   Nests (catacxnveces). Only here and in the parallel, Luke ix. 58. Wests is too limited. The word, derived from oKNVN, a tent, has the more general meaning of shelter or habitation. In classical Greek it is used of an encampment. The nest is not to the bird what the hole is to the fox, a permanent dwell- ing-place, since the bird frequents the nest only during incuba- tion. The Rev. retains nests, but puts lodging-places in the margin.   24. Tempest (cevcpos). Lit., shaking. Used of an earth- quake. The narrative indicates a sudden storm. Dr. Thom- son (“Land and Book”) says: “Such winds are not only violent, but they come down suddenly, and often when the sky is perfectly clear. . . . To understand the causes of these sudden and violent tempests we must remember that the lake lies low—six hundred and eighty feet below the sea; that the mountainous plateau of the Jaulin rises to a considerable height, spreading backward to the wilds of the Hauran, and upward to snowy Hermon; that the water-courses have worn or washed out profound ravines and wild gorges, converging to the head of this lake; and that these act like great funnels to draw down the cold winds from the mountains.”   28. The tombs (uvnpetwv). Chambers excavated in the mountain, which would afford a shelter to the demoniac.   54 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. ([Cu. VUIL   Chandler (“‘ Travels in Asia Minor”) describes tombs with two square rooms, the lower containing the ashes, while in the upper, the friends performed funeral rites, and poured libations through a hole in the floor. Dr. Thomson (“ Land and Book”) thus describes the rock-cut tombs in the region between Tyre and Sidon: “ They are nearly all of the same form, having a small chamber in front, and a door leading from that into the tomb, which is about six feet square, with niches on three sides for the dead.” A propensity to take up the abode in the tombs is mentioned by ancient physicians as a characteristic of mad- men. The Levitical uncleanness of the tombs would insure the wretches the solitude which they sought. Trench (“ Notes on the Miracles”) cites the following incident from Warburton (“The Crescent and the Cross”): ‘On descending from these heights I found myself in a cemetery whose sculptured turbans showed me that the neighboring village was Moslem. The silence of night was now broken by fierce yells and howlings, which I discovered proceeded from a naked maniac who was fighting with some wild dogs for a bone. The moment he per- ceived me he left his canine comrades, and bounding along with rapid strides, seized my horse’s bridle, and almost forced him backward over the cliff.”   Fierce (yaAezol). Originally, dificult, hard. ence hard to manage; intractable.   32. A steep place (rod xpnuvod). Much better the steep (Rev.). Not an overhanging precipice, but a steep, almost per- pendicular declivity, between the base of which and the water was a narrow margin of ground, in which there was not room for the swine to recover from their headlong rush. Dr. Thom- son (“Land and Book”) says: “ Farther south the plain be- comes so broad that the herd might have recovered and recoiled from the lake.” The article localizes the steep as in the vicin- ity of the pasture.   Cu. IX] MATTHEW. 55   CHAPTER LX,   9. Receipt of custom (rer@viov). Rev., place of toll. Wyc., tocbooth, toll-booth, or toll-cabin, which is an excellent word, though obsolete. Sitting at, is, literally, sitting on: the ele- vated platform or bench which was the principal feature of the toll-office, as in modern custom-bazaars, being put for the whole establishment. This customs-office was at Capernaum, the land- ing-place for the many ships which traversed the lake or coasted from town to town; and this not only for those who had business in Capernaum, but for those who would there strike the great road of eastern commerce from Damascus to the harbors of the West. Cicero, in his oration on the Consular Provinces, ac- cuses Gabinius, the pro-consul of Syria, of relieving the Syrians and Jews of some of their legitimate taxes, and of ordering the smali buildings to be taken down, which the publicans had erected at the approaches to bridges, or at the termination of roads, or in the harbors, for the convenience of their slaves and collectors.   16. New (ayvadov). From a, not, and yvdrrTw, to card or comb wool; hence to dress or full cloth. Therefore Rev. renders more correctly undressed cloth, which would shrink when wet, and tear loose from the old piece. Wyc. renders rude. Jesus thus pictures the combination of the old forms of piety peculiar to John and his disciples with the new religious life emanating from himself, as the patching of an old garment with a piece of unfulled cloth, which would stretch and tear loose from the old fabric and make a worse rent than before.   17. Bottles (acxovs). Rev., rightly, wine-skns, though our word bottle originally carried the true meaning, being a bottle of leather. In Spanish, dota means a leather bottle, a boot, and a butt. In Spain wine is still brought to market in pig-skins. In the East, goat-skins are commonly used, with the rough side inward. When old, they break under the fermentation of the wine.   56 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cz. LX   18. Is even now dead (dpru érerevTnaev). The literal force of the aorist tense is more graphic. Just now died.   20. Hem (xpaomédov). Rev., border. The fringe worn on the border of the outer garment, according to the command in Num. xv. 38. Dr. Edersheim (‘Life and Times of Jesus ”) says that, according to tradition, each of the white fringes was to consist of eight threads, one of them wound round the others; first seven times, with a double knot; then eight times with a double knot; then eleven times with a double knot; and, lastly, thirteen times. The Hebrew characters representing these numbers formed the words Jehovah One.   23. Minstrels (avAnras). More correctly, as Rev., jlute- players, hired or volunteering as mourners.   Making a noise (JopuBovpevor). Rev., twmult. Repre- senting the loud screaming and wailing by the women. It is the word used in Acts xvii. 5: “Set the city in an uproar.”   32. Dumb (xwdov). The word is also used of deafness (Matt. xi. 5; Mark vii. 82; Luke vii. 22). It means dull or blunted. Thus Homer applies it to the earth; the dull, senseless earth (“ Iliad,” xxiv., 25). Also to a blunted dart (“ Iliad,” xi., 390). The classical writers use it of speech, hearing, sight, and mental perception. In the New Testament, only of hearing and speech, the meaning in each case being determined by the context.   36. Fainted (jcav éoxvdpévar). Rev., better, were distressed. Note the verb with the participle, denoting their habctwal con- dition. The word orginally means to flay, rend, or mangle. Aschylus uses it of the tearing of dead bodies by fish (“ Persae,” 577). As appropriate to the figure of sheep, it might be ren- dered here fleeced. Wyce., they were travailed.   Scattered (€ppyupévor). So A. V. and Rev. The word is the perfect participle passive of platw, to throw or cast, and means thrown down, prostrated. So Wyc., lying.

So A. V. and Rev. But the word is stronger: thrust out, force them out, as from urgent necessity.   GHA PT li AX:   1. The disciples (tovs wadntas). The or his, referring to them as already chosen, though he nowhere relates their choos- ing. See Mark iii. 14; Luke vi. 13.   2. Apostles (azrocréAwv). Compare disciples, ver. i. Apos- tles is the official term, used here for the first time. They were merely learners (disciples, wadntai) until Christ gave them authority. From azrocté\\da, to send away. An apostle is one sent forth. Compare John xiii. 16 and Rev., one that cs sent. Cremer (“ Biblico-Theological Lexicon”) suggests that it was the rare occurrence of the word in profane Greek that made it all the more appropriate as the distinctive appellation of the twelve. Compare Luke vi. 13; Actsi. 2. Also, John xvii. 18, I have sent. The word is once used of Christ (Heb. iii. 1), and in a very general sense to denote any one sent (2 Cor. viii. 23 ; Philip. ii. 25).   4. The Canaanite (o Kavavaios). Rev., Cananaean. The word has nothing to do with Canaan. In Luke vi. 15; Acts i. 18, the same apostle is called Zelotes. Both terms indicate his connection with the Galilaean Zealot party, a sect which stood for the recovery of Jewish freedom and the maintenance of distinctive Jewish institutions. From the Hebrew hanna, zeal- ous ; compare the Chaldee kandn, by which this sect was de. noted.   5. Judas Iscariot (o Icxapiétns). The article distinguishes him from others of the name of Judas (compare John xiv. 22).   58 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. X.   Iscariot is usually explained as a compound, meaning the man of Kerioth, with reference to his native town, which is given in Joshua (xv. 25) as one of the uttermost cities of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward.  In the four catalogues of the apostles (here; Mark iii. 16 ; Luke vi. 14; Acts i. 18) Simon Peter always stands first. Here expressly ; “first Simon.” Notice that Matthew names them in pairs, and compare Mark vi. 7, “sent them forth two and two.” The arrangement of the different lists varies; but throughout, Peter is the leader of the first four, Philip of the second, and James, son of Alphaeus, of the third.   6. The lostsheep (ra mpo8ata ta arroAwdcTa). The Greek order throws the emphasis on Jost; the sheep, the lost ones. Bengel observes that Jesus says lost oftener than led astray. Compare xviii. 12, 14.   9. Brass (yadxov). Properly copper. A decending climax. Copper would be as unnecessary as gold.   10. Staves (pd8dous). But the proper reading is staff, (pa86or.)   The workman is worthy, etc. Ver. 11, There abide, etc. “The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles,” a tract discovered in 1873 in the library of the monastery of the Most Holy Sepul- chre at Constantinople, by Bryennios, Metropolitan of Nicome- dia, is assigned to the date of 120 a.p., and by some scholars is placed as early as 100 a.p. It is addressed to Gentile Christians, and is designed to give them practical instruction in the Chris- tian life, according to the teachings of the twelve apostles and of the Lord himself. In the eleventh chapter we read as fol- lows: “ And every apostle who cometh to you, let him be re- ceived as the Lord ; but he shall not remain except for one day ; if, however, there be need, then the next day ; but if he remain three days, he is a false prophet. But when the apostle de- parteth, let him take nothing except bread enough till he lodge again, but if he ask money, he is a false prophet.” And again   Cu. X.J MATTHEW. 59   (ch. xili.): “ Likewise a true teacher, he also is worthy like the workman, of hissupport. Every first-fruit, then, of the products of wine-press and threshing-floor, of oxen and sheep, thou shalt take and give to the prophets, for they are your high-priests.  If thou makest a baking of bread, take the first of it and give according to the commandment. In like manner, when thou openest a jar of wine or oil, take the first of it and give to the prophets; and of money and clothing, and every possession, take the first, as may seem right to thee, and give according to the commandment.”   12. When ye come into (eicepydpevor). The Greek indi- cates more distinctly the simultaneonsness of the entrance and the salutation: as ye are entering. Rev., as ye enter. So of the departure, as ye are going forth (éEepyopevot, ver. 14).   14. Shake off (é«rwdtate). “The very dust of a heathen country was unclean, and it defiled by contact. It was re- garded like a grave, or like the putrescence of death. If a spot of heathen dust had touched an offering, it must at once be burnt. More than that, if by mischance any heathen dust had been brought into Palestine, it did not and could not mingle with that of ‘the land,’ but remained to the end what it had been—unclean, defiled and defiling everything to which it ad- hered.” The apostles, therefore, were not only to leave the house or city which should refuse to receive them, “ but it was to be considered and treated as if it were heathen, just as in the similar case mentioned in Matt. xviii. 17. All contact with such must be avoided, all trace of it shaken off” (Edersheim, “ Jewish Social Life in the Days of Christ”). The symbolic act indicated that the apostles and their Lord regarded them not only as unclean, but as entirely responsible for their unclean- ness. See Acts xviii. 6.   16. | send you forth (éy dmocréd\\dkw). Cognate to the word amocrtonXos (apostiec). The J is emphatic: “It is Z that send you forth.”   60 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. Ohne   Wise (dpéviyor). So A. V. and Rev. Denoting prudence with regard to their own safety. Wyc., wary.   Harmless (dxépasov). Lit., wnmimed, unadulterated. Used of wine without water, and of metal without alloy. Hence guileless. So Luther, without falsity. Compare Rom. xvi. 19; Philip. ii. 15. They were to imitate the serpent’s WAriness, but not his wliness. “The presence of the wolves demands that ye be wary; the fact that ye are my apostles (compare “J send you”) demands that ye be gueleless” (Dr. Morison on Matthew).   17. Of men (trav avIporev). Lit., “the men,” already al- luded to under the term wolves.   19. Take no thought (7 wepyurvyjonte). Rev., Be not anxious. See on vi. 25.   In that hour (év éxetvy 7H @pa). Very precise. “In that selfsame hour.” Bengel remarks: “Even though not before. Many feel most strongly their spiritual power when the hour comes to impart it to others.”   25. Beelzebub (BeerteBodd, Beelzebul). There is a coarse witticism in the application of the word to Christ. Jesus calls himself ‘“‘the Master of the house,” and the Jews apply to him the corresponding title of the Devil, Heb., Beelzebul, Master of the dwelling. (The phrase reappears in German, where the Devil is sometimes called Herr vom Haus. See Goethe, “Faust,” sc. xxi.). Dr. Edersheim’s explanation, though in- genious, seems far-fetched. He says that szebuhl, in Rabbinic language, means, not any ordinary dwelling, but specifically the temple ; so that Beelzebul would be Master of the Temple, an expression having reference to the claims of Jesus on his first purification of the temple. He then conceives a play between this word and Beelztbbul, meaning Lord of idolatrous sacrijice, and says: “ The Lord of the temple was to them the chief of idolatrous worship; the representative of God, that of the   Cu. X.] MATTHEW. 61   worst of demons. Beelzebul was Beelzibbul. What, then, might his household expect at their hands?” (“ Life and Times of Jesus ”).   27. Preach («npvéate). Better Rev., proclaim. See on Matt. iv. 17.   29. Sparrows (ctpov9ia). The word is a diminutive, little sparrows, and carries with it a touch of tenderness. At the present day, in the markets of Jerusalem and Jaffa, long strings of little birds, sparrows and larks, are offered for sale, trussed on long wooden skewers. Edersheim thinks that Jesus may have had reference to the two sparrows which, according to the Rabbins, were used in the ceremonial of purification from leprosy (Lev. xiv. 49-54).   Shall not fall. A Rabbinic legend relates how a certain Rabbi had been for thirteen years hiding from his persecutors in a cave, where he was miraculously fed; when he observed that when the bird-catcher laid his snare, the bird escaped or was caught, according as a voice from heaven proclaimed “Mercy” or “Destruction.” Arguing that if even a sparrow cannot be caught without heaven’s bidding, how much more safe was the life of a son of man, he came forth.   39. Confess me (suoroyyjce év eol). A peculiar but very significant expression. Lit., “ Confess im me.” The idea is that of confessing Christ out of a state of oneness with him. “ Abide in me, and being in me, confess me.” It implies iden- tification of the confessor with the confessed, and thus takes confession out of the category of mere formal or verbal acknowl- edgment. “Not every one that saith unto me, * Lord! Lord !” shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.” The true confessor of Christ is one whose faith rests in him. Observe that this gives great force to the corresponding clause, in which Christ places himself in a similar relation with those whom he con- fesses. “I will confess in him.” It shall be as if I spoke abiding in him. “I in them and thou in me, that they may be   62 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cm XS   perfected into one, and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me” (John Xvii. 23).   34. To send (Banreiv). Lit., to throw or cast. By this word the expectancy of the disciples is dramatically pictured, as if he represented them as eagerly looking up for peace as something to be flung down upon the earth from heaven. Dr. Morison gives the picture thus: “All are on tiptoe of expectation. What is it that is about to happen? Is it the reign of peace that is just about to be inaugurated and consummated ? Is there henceforth to be only unity and amity? As they muse and de- bate, lo! a sword is flung into the midst.”   35. Set at variance (Suydoa). Lit., part asunder. Wyc., to depart = part.   Daughter-in-law (viudnv). So A. V. and Rev.; but the full force is lost in this rendering. The word means bride, and though sometimes used in classical Greek of any married woman, it carries a notion of comparative youth. Thus in Homer, “ Odyssey,” iv., 743, the aged nurse, Euryclea, addresses Penelope (certainly not a bride) as vyugda pirn (dear bride), of course as a term of affection or petting. Compare “ Iliad,” iii., 130, where Iris addresses Helen in the same way. The radical and bitter character of the division brought into households by the Gospel is shown by the fact of its affecting domestic rela- tions in their very freshness. The newly-married wife shall be set at variance with her mother-in-law. Wrycliffe’s rendering is peculiar: And the son’s wife against the wifes or husband's mother.   38. His cross (Tov oravpov avtod). This was no Jewish proverb, crucifixion not being a Jewish punishment; so that Jesus uses the phrase anticipatively, in view of the death which he himself was to die. This was one of those sayings described in John xii. 16, which the disciples understood not at the first, but the meaning of which was revealed in the light of later   Cu. XL] MATTHEW. 63   events. The figure itself was borrowed from the practice which compelled criminals to bear their own cross to the place of execution. is cross: his own. All are not alike. There are different crosses for different disciples. The English pro- verb runs: “Every cross hath its inscription”—the name of him for whom it is shaped.   39, Findeth (evpav). The word is really a past participle, found. Our Lord looked back in thought to each man’s past, and forward to its appropriate consummation in the future. Similarly, he who lost (arrodécas). Plato seems to have fore- shadowed this wonderful thought. ‘‘O my friend! I want you to see that the noble and the good may possibly be something different from saving and being saved, and that he who is truly a man ought not to care about living a certain time: he knows, as women say, that we must all die, and therefore he is not fond of life ; he leaves all that with God, and considers in what way he can best spend his appointed term ” (“‘ Gorgias,” 512). Still more to the point, Euripides :   ‘‘Who knows if life be not death, and death life?”  ",

The idea of a place of trade comes in afterward, and naturally, since trade plants itself where people habitually gather. Hence the Roman Forum was devoted, not only to popular and judi- cial assemblies, but to commercial purposes, especially of bank- ers. The ideaof trade gradually becomes the dominant one in the word. In Eastern cities the markets are held in bazaars and streets, rather than in squares. In these public places the chil- dren would be found playing. Compare Zech. viii. 5.   17. Mourn (ékéyao%e). Lit., deat or strike (the breast), as in oriental funeral lamentations.   20. Mighty works (Suvdues). The supernatural works of Christ and his apostles are denoted by six different words in the New Testament, exhibiting these works under different aspects and from different points of view. These will be con- sidered in detail as they occur. Generally, a miracle may be regarded: 1. As a portent or prodigy (7épas) ; as Acts vii. 36, of the wonders shown by Moses in Egypt. 2. As a sign (onpetov), pointing to something beyond itself, a mark of the power or grace of the doer or of his connection with the super- natural world. So Matt. xii. 38. 3. As an exhibition of God’s glory (évdo£ov), Luke xiii. 17; glorious things. 4. As a strange thing (7apdSo£ov), Luke v.26. 5. As a wonderful thing (Savpd- cwov), Matt. xxi. 15. 6. As a power (Stvapis); so here: a mighty work.   22, But (Av). Better Rev., howbert, or as Wyc., neverthe- less. Chorazin and Bethsaida did not repent; therefore a woe lies against them; nevertheless they shall be more excusable than you who have seen the mighty works which were not done among them.   25.

XI] MATTHEW. 67   thy doings. But with the dative, as here (cou, to thee), it means to praise, with an undercurrent of acknowledgment ; to confess only in later Greek, and with an accusative of the object. Rev. gives praise in the margin here, and at Rom. xiv. 11. Tynd., I praise.   Prudent (cvverov). Rev., understanding; Wyc., wary. From the verb ovvinus, to bring together, and denoting that peculiarity of mind which brings the simple features of an ob- ject into a whole. Hence comprehension, msight. Compare on Mark xii. 33, wnderstanding (cvvécews). Wese (copay) and understanding are often joined, as here. The general distinc- tion is between productive and reflective wisdom, but the dis- tinction is not always recognized by the writer.   27. Are delivered (zrapedd3n). More lit., were delivered, as of a single act at a given time, as in this case, where the Son was sent forth by the Father, and clothed with authority. Com- pare xxviii. 18.   Knoweth (éuywooxe). The compound indicating full knowledge. Others behold only in part, “through a glass, darkly.”   28. Labor and are heavy-laden (xomiavtes nal mepopticpé- vot). The first an active, the second a passive participle, ex- hibiting the active and passive sides of human misery.   Give rest (avaratcw). Originally to make to cease ; Tynd., ease; Wyc., refresh. The radical conception is that of relef.   29. Yoke (fuyov). ‘These words, as recorded by St. Matthew, the Evangelist of the Jews, must have sunk the deeper into the hearts of Christ’s Jewish hearers, that they came in their own old, familiar form of speech, yet with such contrast of spirit. One of the most common figurative expressions of the time was that of the yoke for submission to an occupation or obliga- tion. Very instructive for the understanding of the figure is   68 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XL   this paraphrase of Cant. i. 10: ‘ How beautiful is their neck for bearing the yoke of thy statutes; and it shall be upon them like the yoke on the neck of the ox that plougheth in the field and provideth food for himself and his master.’  “The public worship of the ancient synagogue commenced with a benediction, followed by the shema (Hear, O Israel) or creed, composed of three passages of scripture : Deut. vi. 4-9 ; x1. 13-21; Num. xv. 87-41. The section Deut. vi. 4-9,was said to precede xi. 13-21, so that we might take upon ourselves the yoke of the kingdom of heaven, and only after that the yoke of the commandments. The Saviour’s words must have had a special significance to those who remembered this lesson; and they would now understand how, by coming to the Saviour, they would first take on them the yoke of the kingdom of heaven, and then that of the commandments, finding this yoke easy and the burden light ” (Edersheim, “ Life and Times of Jesus,” and “ Jewish Social Life”).   Meek (pais). See on Matt. v. 5.   Lowly (razrewds). The word hasa history. In the classics it is used commonly in a bad and degrading sense, of meanness of condition, lowness of rank, and cringing abjectness and base- ness of character. Still, even in classical Greek, this is not its universal usage. It is occasionally employed in a way which foreshadows its higher sense. Plato, for instance, says, “To that law (of God) he would be happy who holds fast, and follows it in all Awmélty and order ; but he who is lifted up with pride, or money, or honor, or beauty, who has a soul hot with folly, and youth, and insolence, and thinks that he has no need of a guide or ruler, but is able himself to be the guide of others, he, I say, is left deserted of God” (“ Laws,” 716). And Aristotle says: “ He who is worthy of small things, and deems himself so, is wise” (*‘ Nich. Ethics,” iv., 3). At best, however, the classical conveption is only modesty, absence of assumption. It is an ele- ment of wisdom and in no way opposed to self-righteousness (see Aristotle above). The word for the Christian virtue of hwmit- ity (Tamrewodppoovvn), was not used before the Christian era, and   Cu. XI.] MATTHEW. 69   is distinctly an outgrowth of the Gospel. This virtue is based upon a correct estimate of our actual littleness, and is linked with a sense of sinfulness. True greatness is holiness. We are little because sinful. Compare Luke xviii. 14. It is asked how, in this view of the case, the word can be applied to himself by the sinless Lord ? “ The answer is,” says Archbishop Trench, “that for the sinner humility involves the confession of sin, in- asmuch as it involves the confession of his true condition ; while yet for the unfallen creature the grace itself as truly ex- ists, involving for such the acknowledgment, not of sinfwlness, which would be untrue, but of creatureliness, of absolute de- pendence, of having nothing, but receiving all things of God. And thus the grace of humility belongs to the highest angel be- fore the throne, being as he is a creature, yea, even to the Lord of Glory himself. In his human nature he must be the pattern of all humility, of all creaturely dependence ; and it is only as a man that Christ thus claims to be lowly; his human life was a constant living on the fulness of his Father’s love; he ever- more, as man, took the place which beseemed the creature in the presence of its Creator” (“ Synonyms,” p. 145). The Chris- tian virtue regards man not only with reference to God, but to his fellow-man. Jn lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself (Philip. ii. 3, Rev.). But this is contrary to the Greek conception of justice or righteousness, which was simply “his own to each one.” It is noteworthy that neither the Sep- tuagint, the Apocrypha, nor the New Testament recognize the ignoble classical sense of the word.   Ye shall find (evpyjcere). Compare L will gwe you and ye shall find. The rest of Christ is twofold—gwen and found. It is given in pardon and reconciliation. It is found under the yoke and the burden; in the development of Christian experi- ence, as more and more the “ strain passes over” from self to Christ. ‘No other teacher, since the world began, has ever associated learn with rest. ‘Learn of me,’ says the philosopher, ‘and you shall find restlessness.’ ‘Learn of me,’ says Christ, ‘and you shall find rest?” (Drummond, “ Natural Law in the Spiritual World ”).   70 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XIL   30. Easy (ypnords). Nota satisfactory rendering. Christ’s yoke is not easy in the ordinary sense of that word. The word means originally, good, serviceable. The kindred noun, ypyo- rors, occurring only in Paul’s writings, is rendered kindness in 2 Cor. vi. 6; Tit. iii. 4; Gal. v. 22; Eph. ii. 7 (Rev.), and good- ness, Rom. ii. 4 (Rev.). At Luke v. 39, it is used of old wine, where the true reading, instead of better, is good (xpnoros), mel- lowed with age. Plato (“ Republic,” 424) applies the word to education. “ Good nurture and education (tpopy yap Kal mas- Sevors ypnor)) implant good (ayaSas) constitutions; and these good (xpnorat) constitutions improve more and more;” thus evidently using ypnords and ayadeés as synonymous. The three meanings combine in the word, though it is impossible to find an English word which combines them all. Christ’s yoke is wholesome, serviceable, kindly. “ Christ’s yoke is like feathers toa bird; not loads, but helps to motion” (Jeremy Taylor).  ",

The reference is not to the size, but to the propor- tionate part of the multitude which followed him. Hence Rey., correctly, The most part of the multitude.   Their garments (éavrév). Lit., “their own garments.” The disciples spread their garments on the beasts; the multitude strewed their own garments in the way. Dr. Edward Robin- son, cited by Dr. Morison, speaking of the inhabitants of Beth- lehem who had participated in the rebellion of 1834, says: “ At that time, when some of the inhabitants were already im- prisoned, and all were in deep distress, Mr. Farrar, then Eng- lish consul at Damascus, was on a visit to J erusalem, and had rode out with Mr. Nicolayson to Solomon’s Pools. On their return, as they rose the ascent to enter Bethlehem, hundreds of people, male and female, met them, imploring the consul to in-   Car xxt} MATTHEW. 115   terfere in their behalf, and afford them his protection; and all at once, by a sort of simultaneous movement, they spread their garments in the way before the horses.”  The variation of tenses is not preserved in the English ver- sions. Spread their garments, aorist tense, denoting one defi- nite act. Cut down, spread in the way, imperfects, denoting continued action. As Jesus advanced, they kept cutting branches and spreading them, and the multitude kept crying.   9. Hosanna. O save!   10. Was moved (éce/cSm). Moved is hardly strong enough. It is shaken as by an earthquake.  Rev., stirved. As Morison happily observes, “a profounder ground-swell of feeling.”   12. The money-changers («orArAvGicrav). From K6rrufos, the rate of exchange. These changers sat in the temple, in the court of the Gentiles, to change the foreign coins of pilgrims into the shekel of the sanctuary for payment of the annual tribute. See on Matt. xvii. 24.   13. Thieves (Ayjotadv). Rev., correctly, robbers. See on Matt. xxvi. 55; Luke x. 30.   16. Say (Aéyouow). The Rev. is more graphic, are saying. While the songs and shouts are rising, the priests turn angrily to Christ with the question, “Hearest thou what these are saying ?”   Thou hast perfected (xarnptlcw). The same word as at Matt. iv. 21, where it is used of adjusting or mending nets. Its secondary meaning is to furnish completely, equip ; hence to perfect. Thou hast provided the perfection of praise. The quo- tation from Ps. viii. 2, follows the Septuagint, and not the Hebrew, which is, “Thou hast founded strength.”   19. A fig-tree (cuxjv piav). Lit., one single fig-tree. Rev., in margin.   116 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. ([Cu. XXL   Presently (capayphua). Presently, in popular speech, has acquired something of a future force. I will do such a thing presently means, I will do it, not immediately, but soon. The rendering here was correct in the older English sense of 7- stantly. So constantly in Shakspeare :   ‘“PROSPERO. Go, bring the rabble, O’er whom I gave thee pow’r, here, to this place. ARIEL. Presently ? Pros. Ay, with a twink. Ar. Before you can say ‘come,’ and ‘go,’ And breathe twice; and cry ‘so so;’ Hach one tripping on his toe Will be here.” Tempest, iv., 1.   Compare ver. 20. “ How did the fig-tree ¢mmediately wither away ?” Rev.   29. Repented (uerapernSels). This is a different word from that in Matt. ili. 2; iv. 17; petavoeire, Repent ye. Though it is fairly claimed that the word here implies all that is implied in the other word, the New Testament writers evidently recog- nize a distinction, since the noun which corresponds to the verb in this passage (wetayédeva) is not used at all in the New Testa- ment, and the verb itself only five times; and, in every case except the two in this passage (see ver. 82), with a meaning quite foreign to repentance in the ordinary gospel sense. Thus it is used of Judas, when he brought back the thirty pieces (Matt. xxvii. 3); of Paul’s not regretting his letter to the Corinthians (2 Cor. vii. 8); and of God (Heb. vii. 21). On the other hand, Hetavoéw, repent, used by John and Jesus in their summons to repentance (Matt. ili. 2; iv. 17), occurs thirty-four times, and the noun petdvora, repentance (Matt. iii. 8, 11), twenty-four times and in every case with reference to that change of heart and fife wrought by the Spirit of God, to which remission of sins and salvation are promised. It is not impossible, therefore, that the word in this passage may have been intended to carry a different shade of meaning, now lost to us. Merapérouan, as its etymology indicates (uerd, after, and péro, to be an object 0 care), implies an after-care, as contrasted with the change of   Cu. XXL] MATTHEW. 117   mind denoted by petdvora. Not sorrow for moral obliquity and sin against God, but annoyance at the consequences of an act or course of acts, and chagrin at not having known better. “Tt may be simply what our fathers were wont to call hadzwist (had-I-wist, or known better, I should have acted otherwise) ” (Trench). Merapédeva refers chiefly to single acts ; weravova de- notes the repentance which affects the whole life. Hence the . latter is often found in the imperative: Repent ye (Matt. iii. 2; iv. 17; Acts ii. 88; iii. 19); the former never. Paul’s recog- nition of the distinction (2 Cor. vii. 10) is noteworthy. “Godly sorrow worketh repentance (wetdvotav) unto salvation,” a salva- tion or repentance “which bringeth no regret on thinking of it afterwards” (dywetauwéAnrov). There is no occasion for one ever to think better of either his repentance or the salvation in which it issued.   33. Hedged it round about (dpayyov adtd sreptédnxer), Rev., more literally, seta hedge about tt ; possibly of the thorny wild aloe, common in the East.   Digged a wine-press (apufev Anvov). In Isa. v. 1, 2, which this parable at once recalls, the Hebrew word rendered by the Septuagint and here digged, is hewed out, i.e., from the solid rock. ‘ Above the road on our left are the outlines of a wine- fat, one of the most complete and best preserved in the coun- try. Here is the upper basin where the grapes were trodden and pressed. A narrow channel cut in the rock conveyed the juice into the lower basin, where it was allowed to settle; from there it was drawn off into a third and smaller basin. There is no mistaking the purpose for which those basins were ex- cavated in the solid rock ” (Thomson, “Land and Book”),   A tower (vpyov). For watchmen. Stanley (“Sinai and Palestine”) describes the ruins of vineyards in Judea as en- closures of loose stones, with the square gray tower at the corner of each. Allusions to these watching-places, temporary and permanent, are frequent in Scripture. Thus, “a booth in a vineyard” (Isa. i. 8). “The earth moveth to and fro like a   118 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca. XXT.   hammock” (so Cheyne on Isa.; A. V., cottage ; Rev., hut), a vineyard-watchman’s deserted hammock tossed to and fro by the storm (Isa. xxiv. 20). So Job speaks of a booth which the keeper of a vineyard runneth up (xxvii. 18), a hut made of sticks and hung with mats, erected only for the harvest season on the field or vineyard, for the watchman who spreads his rude bed upon its high platform, and mounts guard against the robber and the beast. In Spain, where, especially in the South, the Orient has left its mark, not only upon architecture but also upon agricultural implements and methods, Archbishop Trench says that he has observed similar temporary structures erected for watchmen in the vineyards. The tower alluded to in this passage would seem to have been of a more permanent character (see Stanley above), and some have thought that it was intended not only for watching, but as a storehouse for the wine and a lodging for the workmen.   Let it out (é&éSero). “There were three modes of dealing with land. According to one of these, the laborers employed received a certain portion of the fruits, say a third or a fourth of the produce. The other two modes were, either that the tenant paid a money-rent to the proprietor, or else that he agreed to give the owner a definite amount of the produce, whether the harvest had been good or bad. Such leases were given by the year or for life; sometimes the lease was even hereditary, passing from father to son. There can scarcely be a doubt that it is the latter kind of lease which is referred to in the parable: the lessees being bound to give the owner a certain amount of fruits in their season ” (Edersheim, “Life and Times of Jesus”). Compare ver. 34, and Mark xii. 2, “that he might receive of the fruits ” (dard tév KapTrav).   37. They will reverence (€vtparjoovra). The verb liter- ally means to ¢wrn toward ; hence to give heed to, pay respect to.   41. He will miserably destroy those wicked men (xaxovds KaK@s atrohécet avtovs). There is a play upon the words which the A. V. misses and the Rev. preserves by rendering “ méser.   Gapxxat | MATTHEW. UA)   ably destroy those miserable men.” So the Rheims version : “The naughty men will he bring to naught.” Tynd., “ He will evi? destroy those evzl persons.” The order of the Greek words is also striking : Miserable men, miserably he will destroy them.   Which (ofrcves). The compound Greek pronoun marks the character of the new husbandmen more distinctly than the simple which ; husbandmen of such a character that, or belong- ing to that class of honest men who will give him his due.   44, Shall be broken (cuvdIracdjoerar). The verb is stronger: broken to pieces ; so Rev.   Grind him to powder (Aucuynoes avrov). But the A. V. misses the picture in the word, which is that of the wennowing- fan that separates the grain from the chaff. Literally it is, will winnow him. Rev., scatter him as dust.  ",

The Hebrews reckoned two evenings, an earlier and a later. The former began midway between noon and sunset, or at three o’clock in the afternoon. The latter began at sunset, six o’clock. The reference here is to the earlier evening, though the time may have been well on toward the beginning of the later. The preparations had to be hurried because the Sabbath would begin at sunset,   60. New tomb (xaw@). See on Matt. xxvi. 29. Not newly hewn, but fresh, undefiled by anybody.   A great stone. Though in the Jews’ sepulchres in general there were doors hung on hinges, the grooves and perforations for which may still be seen. Joseph’s tomb may have been differently constructed, or else was in an unfinished state.   63. We remember (éuvjodnuev).

The pronoun ¢hat is very picturesque ; being used of distant objects, and therefore here as pointing to one who is out of the way and far removed. TT\\avos, deceiver, is akin to rAavde, to wander; and hence a vagabond impostor.   64. Error (7Advm). Not, as many render, deceit or imposture, referring to 7Advos above; but the error on the people's part. The last error, namely, the false impression that he has risen from the dead, will be worse than the first error—the impression made by his impostures that he was the Messiah.   65. Ye have (éyere). Or, as some render, imperatively : Have aguard! Rev., in margin, take.   66. Sealing the stone and setting a watch (cdpayicavres Tov Mov, META THS KoveTwoias). Lit., having sealed the stone with the watch. Rev., Sealing the stone, the guard being with them. This is rather awkward, but the rendering rightly cor- rects the A. V. The idea is that they sealed the stone in the presence of the guard, and then left them to keep watch. It would be important that the guard should witness the sealing. The sealing was performed by stretching a cord across the stone and fastening it to the rock at either end by means of sealing clay. Or, if the stone at the door happened to be fastened with a cross beam, this latter was sealed to the rock.   CHAPTER XXVITI.   3. Countenance (eidéa). Rev., more correctly, appearance.

He is in the act of going. See on Matt. xxvi. 32.   9. All hail (yaipere). The ordinary Greek form of saluta- tion.   12. Large money (dpyvpia ixava). Lit., sufficient money. Enough to bribe them to invent a lie.   14. We will persuade (zetcopev). i.e., satisfy or appease. Compare Gal. i. 10. “Do I conciliate men or God ¢”   Secure you (ipas dpepipvovs roujcouer). Lit., make you without care. The word secure, however, is, etymologically, a correct rendering. It is from the Latin se = sie, without, and cura, care. It has passed into the popular meaning to make safe. Compare 1 Cor. vii. 32. “I would have you to be free From cares” (Rev.).   17. Worshipped (spocexivncay). As in ver. 9. Prostrated themselves. The first time that the disciples are described as doing so.   18. Came to. Verse 17 evidently describes the impression made by seeing him at a distance. Possibly from feelings of modesty they had not ventured close to him. Jesus now ap- proaches and addresses them.   Spake—saying (€Addnoev—déyov). Two different words are here used to express speech, with a nice distinction which can hardly be conveyed without paraphrase. The verb Aadeiv is used of speaking, in contrast with or as a breaking of silence, voluntary or imposed. Thus the dumb man, after he was   Cu. XXVIII.] MATTHEW. 149   healed, spake (€Addnoev); and Zacharias, when his tongue was loosed, began to speak (édddev). In the use of the word the writer contemplates the fact rather than the substance of speech. Hence it is used of God (Heb. i. 1), the point being, not what God said, but the fact that he spake to men. On the contra- ry, Aéyew refers to the matter of speech. The verb originally means to pick out, and hence to use words selected as appropriate expressions of thought, and to put such words together in or- * derly discourse. Here, then, we have Jesus first breaking sv- lence (edddnoev), and then discoursing (Aéyor).   Power (é£oucia). Better, authority, as Rev. Is given (€5697). Lit., was given, by the divine decree. 19. Teach (wadnrevcate). Rev., rightly, make disciples of.   In the name (eis ro dvoua). Rev., correctly, “ into the name.” Baptizing into the name has a twofold meaning. 1. Unto, denoting object or purpose, as eis petdvovav, unto repent ance (Matt. iii. 11); eis dpeow apaptidy, for the remission of sins (Acts ii. 38). 2. Into, denoting union or communion with, as Rom. vi. 3, “baptized into Christ Jesus ; into his death ;” i.e., we are brought by baptism into fellowship with his death. Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with him. Eis, into, is the preposition commonly used with baptize. See Acts viii. 16; xix. 3,551 Cor. i. 13, 15; x.2; Gal. iii. 27. In Acts ii. 38, however, Peter says, “ Be baptized upon (ér) the name of Jesus Christ ; and in Acts x. 48, he commands Cornelius and his friends to be baptized én (év) the name of the Lord. To be baptized upon the name is to be baptized on the confession of that which the name implies: on the ground of the name; 80 that the name Jesus, as the contents of the faith and confession, is the ground upon which the becoming baptized rests. Jn the name (év) has reference to the sphere within which alone true baptism is ac- complished. The name is not the mere designation, a sense which would give to the baptismal formula merely the force of   150 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XXVIIL   a charm. The name, as in the Lord’s Prayer (“ Hallowed be thy name”), is the expression of the sum total of the divine Being: not his designation as God or Lord, but the formula in which all his attributes and characteristics are summed up. It is equivalent to his person. The finite mind can deal with him only through his name; but his name is of no avail detached from his nature. When one is baptized into the name of the Trinity, he professes to acknowledge and appropriate God in all that he is and in all that he does for man. He recognizes and depends upon God the Father as his Creator and Preserver ; receives Jesus Christ as his only Mediator and Redeemer, and his pattern of life; and confesses the Holy Spirit as his Sancti- fier and Comforter.   Alway (mdoas ras tyuépas). Lit., all the days. Wyce., in all days.   20. End of the world (cuvtedelas tod aidvos). Rev., in margin, and lit., consummation of the age. The current age is meant; and the conswmmation is coincident with the second coming of Christ, after the Gospel shall have been proclaimed throughout the world. “The Saviour’s mind goes no farther ; for after that, evangelizing work will cease.

The phrase, sons of, is a familiar Hebrew idiom, in which the distinguishing characteristic of the indi- vidual or thing named is regarded as his parent. Thus sparks are sons of fire (Job v.71); threshed corn is son of the floor (Isa. xxi. 10). Compare son of perdition (John xvii. 12); sons of disobedience (Eph. ii. 2; v. 6).   18. Andrew (AvSpéav). A name of Greek origin though in use among the Jews, from avyjp, man, and signifying manly. He was one of the two who came earliest to Christ (Matt. iv. 18, 20; compare John i. 40, 41) ; and hence is always styled by the Greek fathers rpwtoxAntos, first called.   Philip (@/urov). Another Greek name, meaning fond of horses. In ecclesiastieal legend he is said to have been a chariot-driver.   Bartholomew. A Hebrew name—Bar Tolmai, son of Tolmai. Almost certainly identical with Nathanael. Philip and Nathanael are associated by John, as are Philip and Bar- tholomew in the parallel passages of the synoptics. Bartholo- mew is not mentioned in John’s list of the twelve (xxi. 2), but Nathanael is; while the synoptists do not mention Nathanael in their lists, but do mention Bartholomew. Probably he had two names.   Matthew. See on the superscription of Matthew’s Gospel.   Thomas. A Hebrew name, meaning twin, and translated by the Greek Didymus (John xi. 16).   Thaddaeus or Lebbaeus, as in Matt.x.3. He is the Judas of John xiv. 22. Luther calls him der fromme Judas (the good Judas). The two surnames, Lebbaeus and Thaddaeus, mean the same thing—beloved child.   Simon the Canaanite. Properly, Cananaean. See on Matt. x. 4: “No name is more striking in the list than that of   Cx.

What revolution of thought and heart could be greater than that which had thus changed into a follower of Jesus one of the fierce war-party of the day, which looked on the presence of Rome in the Holy Land as treason against the majesty of Jehovah, a party who were fanatical in their Jewish strictures and exclusiveness ¢” (Geikie, “ Life and Words of Christ”).   19. Judas Iscariot. See on Matt. x. 4.   20. Again. Glancing back to the many notices of crowds in the preceding narrative. This reassembling of the multi- tudes, and its interference with the repast of Christ and the dis- ciples, is peculiar to Mark.   21. His friends (oi rap’ avtod). Lit., they who were from beside him: 7.e., by origin or birth. His mother and brethren. Compare vv. 31, 32. Wyc., kimsmen. Tynd., they that be- longed unto him. Not his disciples, since they were in the house with him.   They said (édeyov). Imperfect tense. Very graphic, they kept saying.   22. Beelzebub. See on Matt. x. 25.   And. Notconnecting two parts of one accusation, but two accusations, as is evident from the two 67vs, which are equiva- lent to quotation marks.   24. And. Note the way in which the sayings are linked by this conjunction ; an impressive rhetorical progression.   96. But hath an end. Peculiar to Mark.   27. Spoil (Suapraca). Mark uses the stronger and more vivid compound verb, where Matthew employs the simple dp-   180 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IV.   adoat. The verb means, primarily, to tear in pieces ; to carry away, as the wind; to efface, as footsteps. So, generally, to seize as plunder, snatching right and left.   His goods (ra oxetn). Lit., his vessels. So Wyc. Compare Mark xi. 16; Acts ix. 15; x. 11; 2 Tim. ii. 20. The special object of the robber may be precious vessels of gold or silver ; but the word is probably used in its general sense of household gear.   28. Compare Matt. xii. 31; and note Mark’s superior preci- sion and fulness of detail.   29. Guilty (@&oyos). From éy, in, éye, to hold or have. Lit., is in the grasp of, or holden of. Compare i Cor. xi. 27; James Tie 0:   Eternal damnation (aiwviov duaptnuaros). An utterly false rendering. Rightly as Rev., of an eternal sim. So Wyc., ever- lasting trespass. The A. V. has gone wrong in following Tyn- dale, who, in turn, followed the erroneous text of Erasmus, xpioews, judgment, wrongly rendered damnation. See Matt. xxiii. 88, and compare Rev. there.   30. They said (édeyov). Imperfect tense. Zhey kept saying, or persisted in saying. An addition peculiar to Mark.   31, 32. They sent unto him calling him, and a multitude was sitting about him.

V. misses the point of adrjs by the translation the sacd : the object being not to particularize the Herodias just referred to, but to emphasize the fact that Herodias’ own daughter was put for- ward instead of a professional dancer. Hence Rev., correctly, “the daughter of Herodias herself.”   Damsel (xopaciw). See on Mark vy. 41.   25. Mark’s narrative emphasizes the eager haste with which the murder was pushed. She came in straightway and de- manded the boon forthwith.   By and by (é€avrfs). Obsolete in the old sense of zmme- diately. The A. V. translates etdvs, straightway, in Matt. xiii. 21, by and by : etSéws, Mark iv. 17, immediately : and the same word in Luke xxi. 9, by and by. °*Eéavuris is rendered emme- diately, Acts x. 83; xi. 11: straightway, Acts xxiii. 30: pres- ently, Philip. ii. 28. Rev., forthwith. The expression by and by in older English was sometimes used of place. Thus Chau-   cer. “Right in the same chamber by and by” (close by).   and ‘“Two young knights lying by and by” (near together).   Edward IV. is reported to have said on his death-bed: “I wote (know) not whether any preacher’s words ought more to move you than I that is going by and by to the place that they all preach of.”   Charger. See on Matt. xiv. 8. 26. Exceeding sorry. Where Matthew has sorry.   27. Mark’s favorite straightway. The king is prompt in his response.   Executioner (c7exovhdropa). One of Mark’s Latin words, speculator. A speculator was a guardsman, whose business it   Cu. VL] MARK. 195   was to watch or spy out (speculart). It came gradually to de- note one of the armed body-guard of the Roman emperor. Thus Suetonius says of Claudius that he did not dare to attend banquets unless his speculutores with their lances surrounded him. Seneca uses the word in the sense of executioner. “He met the executioners (speculatortbus), declared that he had nothing to say against the execution of the sentence, and then stretched out his neck.” Herod imitated the manners of the Roman court, and was attended by a company of speculatores, though it was not their distinctive office to act as executioners. Wye. renders man-killer, and Tynd. hangman.   29. Corpse. See on Matt. xxiv. 28.  Stier (“ Words of Jesus”) says of Herod: “This man, whose inner life was burnt out ; who was made up of contradictions, speaking of his kingdom like Ahasuerus, and yet the slave of his Jezebel ; willingly hearing the prophet, and unwillingly kill- ing him ; who will be a Sadducee, and yet thinks of a resurrec- tion ; who has a superstitious fear of the Lord Jesus, and yet a curiosity to see him.”   31. Come apart. See on ch. iii. 7.   37. Shall we go and buy, etc. This question and Christ’s answer are peculiar to Mark.   39. By companies (cuprécta cuprrécia). Peculiar to Mark. The Jewish dining-room was arranged like the Roman: three tables forming three sides of a square, and with divans or couches following the outside line of the tables. The open end of the square admitted the servants who waited at table. This explains the arrangement of the multitude here described by Mark. The people sat down, literally, a table-companies, ar- ranged like guests at table ; some companies of a hundred and some of fifty, in squares or oblongs open at one end, so that the disciples could pass along the inside and distribute the loaves.   Green. Mark only.   av   196 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. Vi   40. In ranks (rpacial mpaciai). Lit., ike beds in a garden. The former adverb, by companies, describes the arrangement ; this the color. The red, blue, and yellow clothing of the poor- est orientals makes an Eastern crowd full of color; a fact which would appeal to Peter’s eye, suggesting the appearance of flower- beds in a garden.   41. Brake and gave (xaréxXacer, édiSov). The verbs are in different tenses; the former in the aorist, the latter in the im- perfect. The aorist implies the emstantaneous, the imperfect the continuous act. He brake, and kept gwing out. Farrar re- marks that the multiplication evidently took place in Christ’s hands, between the acts of breaking and distributing,   All. Peculiar to Mark. Were filled. See on Matt. v. 6.   43. Baskets full (codivwv mrnpopata). Lit., fillings of baskets. See on Matt. xiv. 20. Mark alone adds, and of the Jishes.   44, Men (avdpes). Not generic, including men and women, but literally men. Compare Matt. xiv. 21, beside women and children ; a detail which we should have expected from Mark.   46. When he had sent them away (dzrotafaevos). Rev., more correctly, after he had taken leave. Unzclassical, and used, in this sense only in later Greek. So in Luke ix. 61; Acts xviii. 18; 2 Cor. ii. 18.   48. He saw (idov). Participle. Rev., seeing. Better, how- ever, the literal having seen. It was this which induced him to go to them.   Toiling (Gacavifopuévous). Lit., tormented. Rev., distressed. See on Matt. iv. 24. Wye. travailing. Tynd., troubled.   Fourth watch. Between 3 and 6 a.m.   Cu. VI.] MARK. 197 Would have passed by them. Peculiar to Mark. 50. They all saw him. Peculiar to Mark.   Spake with them (€AdAncev per’ ai’tdv). Both Matthew and John give the simple dative, avrots, to them. Mark’s with them is more familiar, and gives the idea of a more friendly and encouraging address. It is significant, in view of Peter’s relation to this gospel, that Mark omits the incident of Peter’s walk on the waves (Matt. xiv. 28-31).   51. Ceased. See on Mark iv. 38.   Sore amazed (Alav é« mepicaod éEictavto). Lit., exceedingly beyond measure. A strong expression peculiar to Mark. ’E&ic- Tavto, were amazed. Compare the cognate noun ékotaots, and seeon Mark v. 42.   52. Peculiar to Mark.   The miracle of the loaves (é7i rofs dprous). Rev., concern- ing the loaves. Lit., upon; in the matter of. They did not reason from the multiplying of the loaves to the stilling of the sea.   53. Drew to the shore (mpocwppicdncav). Peculiar to Mark. Rev., moored to the shore, though the meaning may be near the shore. “AvéBn, he went up (ver. 51), seems to indicate a vessel of considerable size, standing quite high out of the water. They may have anchored off shore.   55. Ran round. From place to place where the sick were, to bring them to Jesus. Matthew has they sent.   Carry about (zrepipépevv). rept, about; one hither and an- other thither, wherever Christ might be at the time.   Beds (xpaBdrros). Condemned as bad Greek, but used by both Luke and John.

IX,   here. “It takes up substantially the word spoken by the father, and puts it with lively emphasis, without connecting it with the further construction, in order to link its fulfilment to the petitioner’s own faith” (Meyer). We might paraphrase thus. Jesus said: “that if thow canst of thine—as regards that, all things are possible,” etc. There isa play upon the words dvvn, canst, and Svvata, possible, which cannot be neatly rendered. “Tf thou canst—all things can be.”   24. Cried out and said (xpdfas—éreyev). The former de- noting the inarticulate cry, the ejaculation, followed by the words, * Lord, I believe,” ete.   30. Passed through (apemopevovto). Lit. passed along (rapé). Not tarrying. Bengel says, “not through the cities, but past them.”   31. He taught (édiSacxev). ‘The Rev. would have done bet- ter to give the force of the imperfect here: He was teaching. He sought seclusion because he was engaged for the time in in- structing. The teaching was the continuation of the “‘ began to teach ” (viii. 31).   Is delivered. The present tense is graphic. The future is realized by the Lord as already present. See on Matt. xxvi. 2.   33-35. Peculiar to Mark.   35. Servant (SudKovos). Rev., mister. Probably from Svdxa, to pursue ; to be the follower of a person ; to attach one’s self to him. As distinguished from other words in the New Testament meaning servant, this represents the servant in his activity ; while Sodd0s, slave, represents him in his condition or relation as a bondman. A StadKovos may be either a slave or a freeman. The word deacon is an almost literal transcription of the original. See Philip. i. 1; 1 Tim. iii. 8,12. The word is often used in the New Testament to denote mdnisters of the gospel. See 1 Cor. iii. 5; Eph. iii. 7; 1 Thess. iii. 2, and else- where. Mark uses SodA0s in x. 44.   Cu, X.]} MARK. 211   36. Let (€orncev). Wryc. renders ordained.   When he had taken him in his arms (évayxaducdpevos). The verb is found only in Mark, and only he records this detail.   37. In my name. Lit., “upon (él) my name.” See on Matt. xviii. 5.   38. In thy name. John’s conscience is awakened by the Lord’s words. They had not received the man who cast out devils in Christ’s name.   42. Millstone. Rev., great millstone. See on Matt. xviii. 6. Wyc., millstone of asses. Note the graphic present and perfect tenses ; the millstone 7s hanged, and he hath been cast.   43. Hell. See on Matt. v. 22.   47. With one eye (uovodIarpov). Lit., one-eyed. One of Mark’s words which is branded as slang. Wye. oddly renders goggle-eyed.   50. Have lost its saltness (dvanov yévntat). Lit., may have become saltless. Compare on Matt. v. 13.   Will ye season (aprucere), Lit., will ye restore. Compare Col. iv. 5.   CHAPTER =X, 2. Tempting. See on Matt. vi. 13.   4, Bill (8i8Alov). See on Matt. xix. 7. Diminutive.  Lit., a little book ; Lat., labellus, from which comes our word libel, a written accusation. Accordingly Wye. has a libel of forsaking, and Tynd. a testemonial of her. dworcement.   7. Shall cleave. See on Matt. xix. 5. Tynd., bide by.   912 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. X.   8. Shall be one flesh (gcovras els cdpxa piav). Lit., “shall be unto one flesh.” The preposition expresses more graphically than the A. V. the becoming of one from two. So Rev., shal become.   9. What. Regarding the two as one.   13. They brought (mpocédepov). Imperfect tense; they were bringing, as he went on his way. Similarly, were rebuk- ing, as they were successively brought.   16. Took them in his arms. See on ix. 36.   Put his hands upon them and blessed them. The best texts read xatevddyet, TWels Tas yelpas er avtd, blessed them, laying his hands upon them ; including the laying on of hands in the blessing. The compound rendered blessed occurs only here in the New Testament. It is stronger than the simple form, and expresses the earnestness of Christ’s interest. Alford renders fervently blessed.   17. Running and kneeled. Two details peculiar to Mark.   18. Why callest thou, etc. Compare Matt. xix. 17. The renderings of the A. V. and Rev. here are correct. There is no change of reading as in Matthew, where the text was altered to conform it to Mark and Luke.   22. He was sad (otvyvdacas). Applied to the sky in Matt. xvi. 3; lowering. The word paints forcibly the gloom which clouded his face.   25. Needle (padidos). A word stigmatized by the gram- marians as unclassical. One of them (Phrynichus) says, “ As for padis, nobody would know what it is.” Matthew also uses it. See on Matt. xix. 24. Luke uses Bedovns, the surgical needle. See on Luke xviii. 25.   30.

The sudden awe which fell on the dis- ciples is noted by Mark only.   42. Which are accounted to rule. Wyc., that seem to have princehead on folks.   43. Minister. See on ix. 35.   45. For many (avti mwoddav). For, in the sense of over against, instead of ; not on behalf of.   46. Son of Timaeus. Mark, as usual, is particular about names.   Blind. Diseases of the eye are very common in the East. Thomson says of Ramleh, “The ash-heaps are extremely mis- chievous; on the occurrence of the slightest wind the air is filled with a fine, pungent dust, which is very injurious to the eyes. I once walked the streets counting all that were either blind or had defective eyes, and it amounted to about one-half the male population. The women I could not count, for they are rigidly veiled” (“Land and Book”). Palgrave says that ophthalmia is fearfully prevalent, especially among children. “Tt would be no exaggeration to say that one adult out of every five has his eyes more or less damaged by the conse- quences of this disease” (“Central and Eastern Arabia”).   Beggar. See on Matt. v. 3.   49,50. Peculiar to Mark, and adding greatly to the vividness of the narrative.   50. Rose (dvactas). The best texts read avamnénoas, leaped up, or, as Rev., sprang up.   214 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XL   CHAT TIER   2. Colt. Only Matthew addsthe ass. Mark and Luke have colt only.   4. In a place where two ways met (éml tod dpudddov). *Audobor is literally any road which leads round (apt) a place or a block of buildings. Hence the winding way. The word occurs only here in the New Testament. Rev., in the open street, which in an Eastern town is usually crooked. Perhaps, by con- trast with the usual crookedness, the street in Damascus where Paul lodged was called Strazght (Acts ix. 11). “It is a topo- graphical note,” says Dr. Morison, “that could only be given by an eye-witness.” The detail of ver. 4 is peculiar to Mark. Ac- cording to Luke (xxii. 8), Peter was one of those sent, and his stamp is probably on the narrative.   8. Inthe way. Both Matthew and Luke have éy, in; but Mark, eis, into. They threw their garments znto the way and spread them there.   Branches. Matthew, Mark, and John use each a different word for branches. Matt., «dddous, from krde, to break ; hence a young slop or shoot, such as is broken off for grafting—a twig, as related to a branch. Mark, otiBddas, from oreiBa, to tread or beat down ; hence a mass of straw, rushes, or leaves beaten together or strewed loose, so as to form a bed or a carpeted way. A litter of branches and leaves cut from the fields (only Mark) near by. John, Baia, strictly palm-branches, the feathery fronds forming the tufted crown of the tree.   Hosanna. Meaning, O save/ 11.

Peculiar to Mark. Having leaves. An unusual thing at that early season.   If haply (e¢ dpa). If, such being the case, i.e., the tree having leaves—he might find fruit, which, in the fig, precedes the leaf. Mark alone adds, “for the time of figs was not yet.”   14. His disciples heard it. Peculiar to Mark.   15. Money-changers (xoddvGiorov). Another unclassical word, but used also by Matthew. ‘Such words as these might naturally find their place in the mongrel Greek of the slaves and freedmen who formed the first congregations of the church in Rome” (Ezra Abbott, Art. “ Gospels,” in Encyc. Britannica). See on Matt. xxi. 12.   16. Vessel (cxevdos). See on Matt. xii. 29; Mark iii. 27.   Temple (iepod). See on Matt. iv. 5. The temple enclosure, not the vads, or sanctuary. People would be tempted to carry vessels, etc., through this, in order to save a long circuit. The court of the Gentiles, moreover, was not regarded by the Jews as entitled to the respect due to the other part of the enclosure. This our Lord rebukes.   17. Of all nations. Which rendering implies, shall be called by all nations. But render with Rev., a house of prayer for all the nations (racw Tots éSverw).   Thieves (Ayordv). Rev., correctly, robbers. See on Matt. xxi. 18; xxvi. 55; John x. 1, 8. From Anis or Acta, booty. In classical usage mostly of cattle. The robber, conducting his operations on a large and systematic scale, and with the aid of bands, is thus to be distinguished from the «démrtns, or thief who purloins or pilfers whatever comes to hand. <A den would be appropriate to a band of robbers, not to thieves. Thus the traveller to Jericho, in Christ’s parable (Luke x. 30), fell among robbers, not thieves.   216 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XI.   19. When evening was come (6rav). Lit., whenever even- ing came on; not on the evening of the purging of the temple merely, but each day at evening.   20-24. All the details are peculiar to Mark. Compare Matt. xxi. 20-22.   23. Shall come to pass (yiverat). Rather cometh to pass, as Rev.   24. Receive (éAdGere). More lit., recetved. Rev., have re- cewed.   25. Trespasses. See on Matt. vi. 14.   27. Walking. An addition of Mark.   CHAPTER XI, 1-11. Compare Matt. xxi. 33-46.   1. Wine-fat (d7roAj0v). Rev., wine-press. Only here in New Testament. The wine-press was constructed in the side of a sloping rock, in which a trough was excavated, which was _ the wine-press proper. Underneath this was dug another trough, with openings communicating with the trough above, into which the juice ran from the press. This was called by the Romans lacus, or the lake. ‘The word here used for the whole structure strictly means this trough wnderneath (i716) the press (Anvos). This is the explanation of Wyce.’s translation, dalf (delved), a lake.   Went into a far country (dredjuncev). But this is too strong. The word means simply went abroad. So Wyc., went forth in pilgrimage ; and Tynd., into a strange country. Rev., another country. See on Matt. xxv. 14.   Cu. XII} MARK. 217   Of the fruits. Or, literally, from (aro) the fruits, showing that the rent was to be paid in kind.   6. Therefore. The best texts omit. Last. Mark only.   7. Those husbandmen. Lit., they the husbandmen. Wyc., tenants.   10. Scripture (ypadyv). A passage of scripture: hence fre- quently ¢hés scripture ; another scripture ; the same scripture. Luke iv. 21; John xix. 37; Acts i. 16.  11. The Lord’s doing (apa xupiov). Lit., from the Lord.  13-17. Compare Matt. xxii. 15-22.  13. Catch (aypevcwow). From dypa, hunting, the chase. Hence the picture in the word is that of hunteng, while that in   Matthew’s word, mayievowowr, is that of catching in a trap. See on Matt. xxii. 15.   14. Tribute. See on Matt. xxii. 19. Person (pocwtrov). Lit., face.   Shall we give, etc. A touch peculiar to Mark.   15. Penny. See on Matt. xx. 2. 16. Image and superscription. See on Matt. xxii. 20.   17. They marvelled (éfeIavpafov). The preposition ¢€, out of, indicates great astonishment. They marvelled owt of measure. Hence Rev., marvelled greatly. The A. V. follows another reading, with the simple verb é9avpafov. The imper- fect denotes continuance. they stood wondering.   918 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Ca. XII.   18. Who (ofriwes). This pronoun marks the Sadducees as a class: of that party characterized by their denial of the resur- rection.   Asked (éznpotev). Stronger. They questioned.   24. Therefore (Sea robro). A rendering which obscures the meaning. The words point forward to the next two clauses. The reason of your error is your <gnorance of the scriptures and of the power of God. Hence Rev., correctly, Ls 2é not for thes cause that ye err ?   Err (wAavacde). Lit., wander out of the way. Compare Latin errare. Of the wandering sheep, Matt. xviii. 12; 1 Pet. ii. 25. Of the martyrs wandering in the deserts, Heb. xi. 38. Often rendered in the New Testament decewe. See Mark xiii. 5,6. Compare dorépes mravatar, wandering stars (Jude 13), from which our word planet.   26. How in the bush God spake. An utterly wrong ren- dering. In the bush (émi tod Barov), refers to a particular sec- tion in the Pentateuch, Exod. iii. 2-6. The Jews were accus- tomed to designate portions of scripture by the most noteworthy thing contained in them. Therefore Rev., rightly, in the place concerning the bush. Wyc., im the book of Moses on the bush. The article refers to it as something familiar. Compare Rom. xi. 2, év Hla; ie., in the section of scripture which tells of Elijah. There, however, the Rev. retains the A. V. of Hizjah, and puts am in the margin.   27. Ye do greatly err. An emphatic close, peculiar to Mark.   28. Well («aras). Lit., beautifully, finely, admirably. What (7rota). Rather, of what nature.   30. With all thy heart (é& édns tis Kapdias cov). Lit., owt of thy whole heart. The heart, not only as the seat of the   (Oise CUA MARK. 219   affections, but as the centre of our complex being—physical, moral, spiritual, and intellectual.   Soul (vyijs). The word is often used in the New Testa- ment in its original meaning of life. See Matt. 11.20; xx. 28; Acts xx. 10; Rom. xi. 3; John x. 11. Hence, as an emphatic designation of the man himself. See Matt. xii. 18; Heb. x. 38; Luke xxi. 19. So that the word denotes “life in the distinct- ness of individual existence” (Cremer). See farther on Wuyexos, spiritual, 1 Cor. xv. 44.   Mind (8cavoias). The faculty of thought: understanding, especially the mora/ understanding.   31. Neighbor. See on Matt. v. 43. 32-34. Peculiar to Mark,   32. Well, Master, thou hast said the truth; for there is one God. All the best texts omit God.   Well (cadas). Exclamatory, as one says good / on hearing something which he approves.   The truth (é7 ddn3elas). Incorrect. The phrase is ad- verbial; of a truth, in truth, truthfully, and qualifies the suc- ceeding verb, thow hast sacd.   For (671). The A. V. begins a new and explanatory sentence with this word; but it is better with Rev. to translate that, and make the whole sentence continuous: Zhou hast truthfully sard that he 7s one.   33. Understanding (cvvécews). A different word from that in ver. 30. From ocuvinus, to send or bring together. Hence cuveows is a union or bringing together of the mind with an object, and so used to denote the faculty of quick comprehen- sion, intelligence, sagacity. Compare on ouverdv, the pru- dent, Matt. xi. 25.   220 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XII,   34. Discreetly (vovveyas). From vods, mind, and éyw, to have. Having his mind in possession: “having his wits about him.” The word occurs only here in the New Testament.   37. The common people (0 zrodvs dyAos). Not indicating a social distinction, but the great mass of the people: the crowd at large.   38. Desire (9é\\ovrwv). See on Matt. i. 19.   39. Uppermost rooms (zpwtoxdtcias). More correctly, the chief couches. So Rev., chief places.   40. Widows’ houses. People often left their whole for- tune to the temple, and a good deal of the temple-money went, in the end, to the Scribes and Pharisees. The Scribes were universally employed in making wills and conveyances of property. They may have abused their influence with widows.   41. The treasury. In the Court of the Women, which covered a space of two hundred feet square. All round it ran a colonnade, and within it, against the wall, were the thirteen chests or “trumpets” for charitable contributions. These chests were narrow at the mouth and wide at the bottom, shaped like trumpets, whence their name. Their specific objects were care- fully marked on them. Nine were for the receipt of what was legally due by worshippers, the other four for strictly voluntary gifts. See Edersheim, ‘The Temple.”   Beheld (éSewper). Observed thoughtfully. Cast. Note the graphic present tense: are casting.   Money (yaAxdv). Lit., copper, which most of the people gave.   Cast in (€8addov). Imperfect tense: were casting in as he looked.   cu. XIII] MARK. 221   Much (7oaAd). Lit., many things ; possibly many pieces of current copper coin,   42. A certain (uéa). Not a good translation. Lit., one as distinguished from the many rich. Better, simply the indefi- nite article, as Rev.   Poor (rrwx7). See on Matt. v. 3.   Mites (Aerra). From derrés, peeled, husked ; and thence thin or fine. Therefore of a very small or thin coin.   Farthing (xoSpdvrns). A Latin word, guadrans, or a quarter of a Roman as, quadrans meaning a fourth, as farthing is   fourthing.   43. This poor widow (7 yijpa airy  wrwy7). The Greek order is very suggestive, forming a kind of climax: this widow, the poor one, or and she poor.  ",

Usually in New Testament of public reading.* After the liturgical services which introduced the worship of the synagogue, the “minister” took a roll of the law from the ark, removed its case and wrappings, and then called upon some one to read. On the Sabbaths, at least seven persons were called on successively to read portions of the law, none of them consisting of less than three verses. After the law fol- lowed a section from the prophets, which was succeeded imme- diately by a discourse. It was this section which Jesus read and expounded. See Acts xiii. 15; Neh. viii. 5, 8. For a de- tailed account of the synagogue-worship, see Edersheim, “ Life and Times of Jesus,” i., 480 sq.   17. The book (@:8rov). A diminutive of BiBros, the inner bark of the papyrus, used for writing. Hence a roll. The word is also used to denote a division of a work, and is there- fore appropriate here to mark the writings of a single prophet as related to the whole body of the prophetic writings.   Opened (avarrvéas). Lit., wnrolled. Both this and the simple verb 1tvcca, to close (ver. 30), occur only once in the New Testament. The former word was used in medical lan- guage of the opening out of various parts of the body, and the latter of the rolling up of bandages. The use of these terms by Luke the physician is the more significant from the fact that elsewhere in the New Testament évotyw is used for the opening of a book (Apoc. v. 2-5; x. 2, 8; xx. 12); and eidlcow, for rolling i up (Apoe. vi. 14).   Found. As if by chance: reading at the place where the roll opened of itself, and trusting to divine guidance.   Was written (jv yeypaupévov). Lit., was having been written ; i.e., stood written.   18. Anointed. See on Christ, Matt. i. 1.   To preach good tidings. See on Gospel, Superscription of Matthew.      * Tn post-classical Greek, sometimes of reading aloud with comments. This nay explain the parenthesis in Matt. xxiv. 15.   Cx. IV.] LUKE. , 291   To the poor (7twyxois). See on Matt. v. 3.   To heal the broken-hearted. The best texts omit. So Rev.   To preach («npvéar). Better as Rev., proclaim, as a herald. See on 2 Pet. ii. 5.   To the captives (aiywaroros). From aiypn, a spear-pomnt, and daricKopuat, to be taken or conquered. Hence, properly, of prisoners of war. Compare Isa. xlii.7: “To bring out captives from the prison, and those who sit in darkness from the house of restraint.” The allusion is to Israel, both as captive exiles and as prisoners of Satan in spiritual bondage. Wye. has caytefs, which formerly signified captives.   To set at liberty (arocteiAas) Lit., to send away in dis- charge. Inserted from the Sept. of Isa. viii. 6. See on ch. iii. 3, and Jas. v. 15.   Them that are bruised (re3pavopévous). Lit., broken in preces. Only here in New Testament. Wyc., to delwwer broken men into remission. The same Hebrew word is used in Isa. xlii. 3: “a crushed reed shall he not break,” which the Sep- tuagint translates by te9Xacpévov, a word which does not occur in the New Testament. In the citation of this latter passage (Matt. xii. 20, on which see) the word for bruised is cvvtpiBa, which the Septuagint uses for break.   19. To preach (Rev., proclaim) the acceptable year of the Lord. As on the first day of the year of Jubilee, when the priests went through the land proclaiming, with sound of trumpet, the blessings of the opening year (Lev. xxv. 8-17). Note ver. 10, where liberty is to be proclaimed to all in that year. Wyc., the year of the Lord pleasant. A literal interpre- tation of the word year gave rise among some of the Christian fathers to the theory that our Lord’s ministry lasted but a single year.   292 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IV.   20. He closed (wrvéas). See on ver. 17.   Minister (j7rnpérn). See on Matt. v. 25. Lit., as Rev., at- tendant. Minister is likely to be misunderstood as referring to the president of the congregation, who, as the teaching elder, would have addressed the people if Jesus had not done so. It means the attendant who had charge of the sacred rolls. He was a salaried officer, a kind of chapel-clerk.   Sat down. As about to teach; that being the habitual position of a Jewish teacher.   Were fastened (7jcav atevifovres). The participle and finite verb denoting continuous, steadfast attention. The verb, from teva, to stretch, denotes fixed attention. Indeed, the word attention itself, etymologically considered, conveys the same idea.   21. He began. Not necessarily denoting his first words, but indicating a solemn and weighty opening.  22. Bare him witness. Compare ver. 14. They confirmed the reports which had been circulated about him. Note the imperfect tense. There was a continuous stream of admiring comment. Similarly, were wondering.   At the gracious words (Adyous tis ydputos). Literally and correctly, as Rev., words of grace. See on ch. i. 80.   Is not (ody). Expecting an affirmative answer. 23. Surely (wdvytaws). Lit., by all means. Rev., doubtless.   Proverb (zrapaBoanv). Rev., parable. See on Matt. xiii. 3 Wyc., lekeness.   Physician, heal thyself. A saying which Luke alone re- cords, and which would forcibly appeal to him as a physician.   Cx. IV.] LUKE. 293   Galen speaks of a physician who should have cured himself before he attempted to attend patients. The same appeal was addressed to Christ on the cross (Matt. xxvii. 40, 42).   25. A great famine was throughout all the land (éyévero Aypos wéyas el Tacav THY yhv). More literally and correctly, as Rey., there came (or arose) a great famine over all the land.   27. Lepers. Wye. renders meselis, the middle-English word for a leper, and derived from msellus, a diminutive of the Latin miser, wretched.   29. The brow (ddpvos). Only here in New Testament. Wyc., cope, which is originally cap or hood. The word is used in medical language both of the eyebrows and of other pro- jections of the body. It would naturally occur to a physician, especially since the same epithets were applied to the appear- ance of the eyebrows in certain diseases as were applied to Azlls. Thus Hippocrates, describing a deadly fever, says, “ The eye- brows seem to hang over,” the same word which Homer uses of arock. So Aretaeus, describing the appearance of the eye- brows in elephantiasis, depicts them as mpoBdjres, projecting, and oyIadeus, ike mounds. Stanley says: “ Most readers prob- ably from these words imagine a town built on the summit of a mountain, from which summit the intended precipitation was to take place. This is not the situation of Nazareth; yet its position is still in accordance with the narrative. It is built upon, that is, on the side of a mountain, but the brow is not beneath, but over the town, and such a cliff asis here implied is found in the abrupt face of a limestone rock about thirty or forty feet high, overhanging the Maronite convent at the south- west corner of the town ” (“Sinai and Palestine ”).   Cast him down headlong (xataxpnyvica). Only here in New Testament, and in the Septuagint only in 2 Chron. xxv. 12.   31-37. Compare Mark i, 21-28.   294 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IV.   31. Taught (jv diddcxwv). Correctly, as Rev., was teaching. The finite verb and participle denoting continuance.   On the Sabbath-days (rots cdB8Bacw). Rev., day. The word is often used in the plural form for the single day, as in ver. 16; probably after the analogy of plural names of festi- vals, as 7a dtupua, the feast of unleavened bread ; Ta yevéota, the birth-day ; or perhaps following the Aramaic plural.   32. They were astonished (é£erAnoocovto). See on Matt. vil. 28.   33. A spirit of an unclean devil. Where the rendering should be demon. This is the only case in which Luke adds to that word the epithet wnclean.   34. What have we to do with thee (rt iv Kai cot)? Lit., what is there to us and to thee ? 2.e., what have we in common ? So Wyc.   35. Hold thy peace (diueInre). Lit., be muzzled or gagged. See on Matt. xxii. 12.   Had thrown (pzyav). Used in connection with disease by Luke only, and only here. In medical language, of convulsions, fits, etc.   Hurt him not (udev Brayray adrov). Lit., im no possible way. Mark omits this detail, which a physician would be care- ful to note. Brdmrew, to eure, occurs but twice in New Testament—here and Mark xvi. 18. It is common in medical language, opposed to wdereiv, to benefit, as of medicines or diet hurting or benefiting.   36. They were all amazed (éyévero SauBos émli mavtas). Lit., as Rev., amazement came upon all. OdpBos, amazement, is used by Luke only. The kindred verb, SauBéouat, to be amazed, occurs only once in Luke (Acts ix. 6), and three times in Mark ; while Mark alone has the strong compound é«JayuPéa, to be greatly amazed (Mark ix. 15).   Cu. IV.] LUKE. 295   37. The fame (%yos). Lit., novse. Rev., rwmor. Only here, ch. xxi. 25, where the correct reading is #yous, the roaring, and Actsii.2. Heb. xii. 19 is a quotation from the Septuagint. It is the word used in Acts ii. 2 of the mighty rushing wind at Pentecost. Mark uses d«o7, in its earlier sense of a report. The same word occurs in Luke, but always in the sense in which medical writers employed it—hearing or the cars. See ch. vil. 1; Acts xvii. 20; xxviii. 26. \"Hyos was the medical term for sound in the ears or head. Hippocrates uses both words together: “the ears (axoal) are full of sound (jyov) ;” and Aretaeus of the noise of the sea, as Luke xxi. 25.   38-41. Compare Matt. viii. 14-17; Mark i. 29-34,   38. Taken (cuveyouévn). Rev., holden. So Wyc. See on Matt. iv. 24. The word is used nine times by Luke, and only three times elsewhere. Paul uses it of the constraining of Christ’s love (2 Cor. v. 14), and of being wa strait (Philip. i. 23). In Acts xxviii. 8, it is joined with fever, as here, and is a common medical term in the same sense.   A great fever (aupert® peyddo). Another mark of the physician. The epithet great is peculiar to Luke. The ancient physicians distinguished fevers into great and small.   39. He stood over her. Asaphysicianmightdo. Peculiar to Luke.   Rebuked. Peculiar to Luke. 40. When the sun was setting. The people brought their sick at that hour, not only because of the coolness, but because   it was the end of the Sabbath, and carrying a sick person was regarded as work. See John v. 10.   Diseases (vocows). See on Matt. iv. 23. Wye. Sick men with divers languishings.   Laid his hands on. Peculiar to Luke.   296 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. V.   Every one. “Implying the solicitude and indefatigableness of this miraculous ministry of love ” (Meyer).   41. Crying out (xpavydfovra). The inarticulate demoniac scream.   Saying. The articulate utterance.  Mr. Hobart (“Medical Language of St. Luke”) remarks that the medical bias of Luke may be seen from the words he ab- stains from using as well as from those he does use in respect of disease. Thus he never uses padaxia for sickness, as Matthew does (iv. 28; ix. 35; x. 1), since this word is never so used in medical language, but is confined to the meaning of delicacy, effeminacy. So, too, he never uses Bacavifew, to torment, of sickness, as Matthew does (viii. 6), as it is never so used in medical language, the word there meaning to examine some part of the body or some medical question.   42-44, Compare Mark i. 35-39.   42. Sought after (érefjrovv). Imperfect tense: were seek- ang.   Came unto him (jAJov &ws avdtod). Stronger than came to; for ws is even up to, showing that they did not discontinue their search until they found him. Mark’s narrative here is fuller and more graphic.  ",

Bengel, however, goes too far when he represents the members of the council as speaking in the figure of a canker. ‘“‘ They regard the whole as a canker.”   18. To speak (¢3éyyec9ar). See on 2 Pet. ii. 16.   21. Punish (xoAdowvra). Originally, to curtail or dock ; te prune as trees: thence to chech, keep im bounds, punish.   24. Lord (Séo7rora). See on 2 Pet. ii. 1.  25. Servant (zraidds). See on ch. iii. 13.  Rage (é¢pvafav). Only here in New Testament. Origi- nally, to netgh or snort like a horse. Of men, to give one’s self haughty airs, and to act and speak insolently. Philo describes a proud man as “ walking on tiptoe, and bridling (ppvatropevos), with neck erect like a horse.”  27. Didst anoint (éypscas). Seeon Christ, Matt. i. 1.  28. Thy hand. Thy disposing power.  32. Heart and soul. See on Mark xii. 30.   33. Gave (dmedidovr). Lit., gave back (amo); as something which they were in duty bound to give.   37. The money (70 ypfjua). The sum of money.   CHAPTER YV.   2. Kept back (évocdicaro). Only here, ver. 3, and Tit. ii. 10, where it is rendered purloonig. From voodu, aloof, apart. The verb means to set apart for one’s self; hence to appropriate wrongfully.   Cu. V.J THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 467   3. To lie to (etcacSar). Rather, to decewe. The design of Satan was to decewe the Holy Ghost. Zo die to would re- quire a different case in the noun, which occurs in ver. 4, where the same verb is properly rendered Zze (unto God). Satan fills the heart to decewe. Theresult of the attempt is merely to de.   4. Whiles it remained, was it not thine own (ovyi pévor ? coi éueve). A play on the words. Lit., remaining, did it not remain to thee? Rev., very happily, wheles ct remained, did it not remain thine own ?   Conceived (é9ov). Lit., put or fiwed. Wherefore didst thou Jia this deed in thy heart ?—i.e., resolve upon tt.   5. Gave up the ghost (é&éyuée). Used by Luke only. A rare word, occurring in the Septuagint, and in medical writers. See Ezek. xxi. 7, “ Every spirit shall faint.” See, also, on fazl- ing, Luke xxi. 26.   6. Wound him up (cuvéctevAav). Better, as Rev., wrapped him round. The verb means to draw together, or draw in; hence used for shortening sail, reducing expenses, lowering or humbling a person. In 1 Cor. vii. 29, it occurs in the phrase, “the time is short (cuvectadpévos, Rev., properly, shortened) ;” i.e., drawn together, contracted. In the sense of wrapping up it is found in Aristophanes, of wrapping cloaks or garments about one; also of tucking up the garments about the loins, as a preparation for service. In the sense of shrouding for burial, it occurs in Euripides (“Troades,” 382): “They were not shrouded (avverectadyoar) by the hands of a wife.” In medical language, of bandaging a limb; of the contraction of tumors, and of organs of the body, etc. Some, however, as Meyer, refer the word here to the pressing together of the dead man’s limbs.   8. Answered. ‘The woman, whose entrance into the as- sembly of the saints was like a speech” (Bengel).   468 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca. V   For so much (rogovrov). Perhaps pointing to the money still lying at his feet.   9. Ve have agreed together (cuvedavyIn tpiv). The verb is passive. Lit., was et agreed by you. The figure in the word is that of concord of sounds. Your souls were attuned to each other respecting this deceit. See on muszc, Luke xv. 25.   To tempt (etpdcar). To put it to the proof whether the Holy Spirit, ruling in the apostles, could be deceived. See on ver. 3.   The feet. Graphic. The steps of the young men returning from the burial are heard at the door.   12. Were wrought (éyévero). The best texts read éyiveto, the imperfect, were being wrought from time to time.   All. The whole body of believers.   13. The rest. Unbelievers, deterred by the fate of Ananias from uniting themselves to the church under false pretences.   Join himself (ckoArNaoIaz). See on Luke xv. 15; x. 11. In all but two instances (Rom. xii. 9; 1 Cor. vi. 17), the word im- plies a forced, unnatural, or unexpected union. Thus Philip would not, without a special command, have “ joined himself ” to the chariot of the Ethiopian prince (Acts viii. 29). Saul’s attempt to join himself to the apostles was regarded by them with suspicion (Acts ix. 26); and the fact that certain persons “clave to” Paul in Athens is expressly contrasted with the attitude of the citizens at large. The sense of an unnatural union comes out clearly in 1 Cor. vi. 16.   14. Were added (mpoceridevro). Imperfect: kept being added.   15. Couches («paBBdtwv). See on Mark ii. 4.   Cu.

Incorrect. Tiipnois is not used in the sense of prison, but is an abstract term meaning ward or keeping, as in ch. iv. 3. There is no article, moreover.

The word in this passage is the name of the Spartan assembly, Gerousia, the assembly of elders, consisting of thirty members, with the two kings. “The well-known term,” as Meyer remarks, “is fittingly transferred from the college of the Greek gerontes to that of the Jewish presbyters.” They summoned, not only those elders of the people who were likewise members of the Sanhedrim, but the whole council (add the senate) of the representatives of the people.   Prison (Secuwrnpuov). Still another word for prison. Com- pare vv. 18,19. Rev., prison-house. The different words em- phasize different aspects of confinement. Trpnous is keeping, as the result of guarding. See onver.18. ®vdax7 emphasizes the being put under guard, and Secuwripiov the being put in bonds.   22. Officers (j7npéras). See on Matt. v. 25.   24.

Sometimes zre(9w is used. But this word, in itself, is the only one of the several in use which expresses the conception of obedience exclusively. ‘Ymaxovew is to obey as the result of /s- tening to another: meiMeoSas is to obey as the result of persua- sion. This is the special term for the obedience which one owes to authority (apy7). It occurs four times in the New Testament: Acts v. 29, 32; xxvii. 21; Tit. iii. 1; and in every case, of obedi- ence to established authority, either of God or of magistrates. In Acts xxvii. 21, where it is used of the ship’s officers hearken- ing to Paul’s admonition not to loose from Crete, Paul speaks of his admonition as divinely inspired ; compare xxvii. 10. In ch. iv. 19, Peter and John say hearken (axovew). That is a mere listening to or considering the proposition made to them. This is a deliberate course of action.   30. Ve slew (SceyerploacSe).

In this case the apostles are described as dignt- Jied by indignity.   Cx. VL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 473   CHAPTERS Via   1. And (62). Better dut, as a contrast is now introduced with the prosperous condition of the Church indicated at the close of the last chapter.   Was multiplied (aAnSuvovrav). Lit., “when the disciples were multiplying ;” the present participle indicating something in progress.   A murmuring (yoyyvopos). See on the kindred word mur- murers, Jude 16.   Grecians (EAAnuordv). Rev., much better, Grecian Jews, with Hellenists in margin. “Grecians” might easily be under- stood of Greeks in general. The word Hellenists denotes Jews, not Greeks, but Jews who spoke Greek. The contact of Jews with Greeks was first effected by the conquests of Alexander. He settled eight thousand Jews in the Thebais, and the Jews formed a third of the population of his new city of Alexandria. From Egypt they gradually spread along the whole Mediter- ranean coast of Africa. They were removed by Seleucus Nica- tor from Babylonia, by thousands, to Antioch and Seleucia, and under the persecutions of Antiochus Epiphanes scattered them- selves through Asia Minor, Greece, Macedonia, and the Aigean islands. The vast majority of them adopted the Greek lan- guage, and forgot the Aramaic dialect which had been their language since the Captivity. The word is used but twice in the New Testament—here and ch. ix. 29—and, in both cases, of Jews who had embraced Christianity, but who spoke Greek and used the Septuagint version of the Bible instead of the original Hebrew or the Chaldaic targum or paraphrase. The word “ExrAnv, Greek, which is very common in the New Testament, is used in antithesis, either to ‘ Barbarians” or to “ Jews.” In the former case it means all nations which spoke the Greek language (see Acts xviii. 17; Rom. i. 14; 1 Cor. i. 22, 23). In   474 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VL   the latter it is equivalent to Gentiles (see Rom. i. 16; TOs 1 Cor. x. 32; Gal. ii. 3). Hence, in either case, it is wholly different from Hedlenist.   Hebrews. Hebrew is the proper antithesis to Hellenist. A man was ‘Iovdaios, a Jew, who traced his descent from Jacob, and conformed to the religion of his fathers. He might speak Greek and be a Hellenist. He was ‘Efpatos, a Hebrew, only as he spoke Hebrew and retained Hebrew customs. The distinc- tion between Hebrew and Hellenist was a distinction within the Jewish nation, and not between it and other nations. Thus Paul calls himself a Hebrew of Hebrews ; i.e., a Hebrew and of Hebrew parents (Philip. iii. 5 ; compare 2 Cor. xi. 22).   Were neglected (sapeSewpodvro). Only here in New Tes- tament. Lit., were overlooked. The imperfect denoting some- thing habitual.  Daily (xa9nuepwh). Only here in New Testament.   Ministration (S:axovia). Or service. See on minaster, Matt. xx. 26. The reference is to the distribution of provision.   2. Reason (dpecrov). Lit., pleasing or agreeable.   Leave (xaradeipavras). Rather forsake or abandon : leave in the lurch.   Serve tables. Superintend the distribution of food.   3. Of good report (waprupovpévous). Lit., attested, having witness borne them.   4. We will give ourselves continually (rpocxaprepycoper). See on ch. i. 14. Rev., continue steadfastly.   5. Stephen, etc. The names are all Greek. There is no reason to infer from this that they were all Hellenists. It was   Cu. VL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 475   customary among the Jews to have two names, the one Hebrew and the other Greek. They were probably partly Hebrews and partly Hellenists.   7. To the faith (77 méores). Opinions differ greatly as to whether this is to be taken as meaning facth in Jesus Christ, or faith considered as Christian doctrine—the Gospel ; the faith in the ecclesiastical sense. This passage and Gal. i. 23 are the strong passages in favor of the latter view; but the general usage of the New Testament, added to the fact that in both these passages the former meaning gives a good, intelligible, and perfectly consistent sense, go to confirm the former inter- pretation.  1. In the great majority of New Testament passages fash is clearly used in the sense of faith in Jesus Christ: “the con- viction and confidence regarding Jesus Christ as the only and perfect mediator of the divine grace and of eternal life, through his work of atonement” (Meyer).  2. This interpretation is according to the analogy of such expressions as obedience of Christ (2 Cor. x. 5), where the meaning is, clearly, obedience to Christ: obedcence of the truth (1 Pet. i. 22). Accordingly, faith, though it becomes in man the subjective moral power of the new life, regenerated through the power of the Spirit, is regarded objectively as a power—the authority which commands submission.  3. This interpretation is according to the analogy of the ex- pression hearing of faith (Gal. iii. 2), which is to be rendered, not as equivalent to the reception of the Gospel, but as the report or message of faith; ie., which treats of faith, axon, hearing being always used in the New Testament in a passive sense, and often rendered fame, rumor, report (see Matt. iv. 24; xiv. 1; Mark i. 28; John xii. 38; Rom. x. 16). Compare, also, obedv- ence of faith (Rom. i. 5; xvi. 26), where faith is to be taken as the object, and not as the source, of the obedience; and hence is not to be explained as the obedience which springs from faith, but as the obedience rendered to faith as the authoritative impulse of the new life in Christ.  The great majority of the best modern commentators hold   476 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. VL   that faith is to be taken as the subjective principle of Christian life (though often regarded objectively as a spiritual power), and not as Chrestian doctrine.   8. Did (éoée:). Imperfect: was working wonders during the progress of the events described in the previous verse.   9. Synagogue. See on Church, Matt. xvi. 18.   Of the libertines. In Jerusalem, and probably in other large cities, the several synagogues were arranged according to nationalities, and even crafts. Thus we have in this verse men- tion of the synagogues of the Cyrenians, Alexandrians, Cilicians, and Asiatics. ébertines is a Latin word (libertini, freedmen), and means here Jews or their descendants who had been taken as slaves to Rome, and had there received their liberty ; and who, in consequence of the decree of Tiberius, about 19 a.p., expelling them from Rome, had returned in great numbers to Jerusalem. They were likely to be the chief opponents of Stephen, because they supposed that by his preaching, their religion, for which they had suffered at Rome, was endangered in Jerusalem.   10. They were not able (ov« icyvov). See on Luke xiv. 30; xvi. 3.   11. Suborned (i7éBadov). Only here in New Testament. The verb originally means to put wnder, as carpets under one’s feet; hence, to put one person in place of another ; to substi- tute, as another’s child for one’s own ; to employ a secret agent in ones place, and to instigate or secretly struct him.   12. They stirred up the people (cvvexivnoay tov adr). The verb occurs only here in the New Testament. It implies to stir up as a mass, to move them together (cvv).

THE  THESSALONIAN  EPISTLES,   INTRODUCTION.  THE    FIB8T    EPIBTLB.   Thebsaloniga  was  situated  on  the  Thermaic  Oulf ,  a  fine harbour,  affording  anchorage  for  large  ships  directly  in  front of  the  city.*  The  situation  commanded  the  trade  of  the Macedonian  waters,  and  was  connected  inland  with  the  plain of  the  Axius,  one  of  the  great  levels  of  Macedonia,  and  with the  plain  of  the  Strymon,  by  a  pass  across  the  peninsula  of Chalcidice.  It  was  the  chief  station  on  the  Via  Egnatia,  the great  Roman  road  which  ran  from  Dyrrhachium  through Epirus,  Macedonia,  and  Thrace  to  Byzantium.  In  Paul's  day  it  was  a  free  city,  the  capital  of  the  whole province  and  the  most  populous  of  its  towns.  Its  extensive trade  with  all  parts  of  the  world  accounts  in  part  for  the rapid  spread  of  the  news  of  the  success  of  the  gospel  (1  Th. i.  8).  The  population  consisted  of  the  original  Graeco- Macedonian  inhabitants,  mixed  with  many  Romans  and  some Jews.  The  same  heathen  deities  were  worshipped  as  in  other Graeco-Roman  communities,  and  the  worship  of  the  Cabeiri had  been  introduced  from  Samothrace.f  Paul's  first  visit  to  Thessalonica  is  related  in  Acts  xvii. ; and  the  account  must  be  filled  out,  as  far  as  possible,  by  means  •  \"  Medio  flexu  Uteris.\"    Pliny,  H.  N.  iv.  10.  t  The  Cabeiri  were  Pelasgic  deiUes  worshipped  in  the  islands  between Eaboea  and  the  Hellespont,  on  the  adjacent  coasts  of  Asia  Biinor,  and  at Thebes  and  Andania  in  Greece.  They  were  f onr  in  number,  answering  to Demeter,  Persephone,  Hades,  and  Hermes  in  the  Greek  m3rthology.  Throned out  the  Boman  period  of  Greek  history  the  Cabeiric  mysteries  were  held  only second  to  the  Elensinian,  and  many  Bomans  of  high  position  were  initiated. ",

From  the  Acts  it  appears that  he  remained  only  three  weeks;  but  the  first  Epistle indicates  that  a  large  and  flourishing  church  had  been  formed, chiefly  of  Gentiles  (i.  8, 9);  and  from  this,  and  from  the  facts that  the  Philippians,  twice  during  his  stay,  sent  him  pecuniary aid  (Philip,  iv.  16),  and  that  he  labored  for  his  own  support, his  visit  would  seem  to  have  been  longer.  According  to  the  narrative  in  Acts,  he  secured  some  con- verts from  among  the  Jews,  but  more  from  the  pious  Oreeks or  Proselytes,  and  many  prominent  women.  Nothing  is  said of  his  labours  among  the  heathen.  The  author  of  the  Acts has,  apparently,  recorded  the  least  important  part  of  his  work, which  was  evidently  begun,  according  to  his  usual  practice, in  the  synagogue.  The  principal  part  of  it,  however,  was Hot  done  in  the  synagogue.  The  cause  of  Paul's  departure  from  Thessalonica  was  a persecution  instigated  by  the  Jews,  who  used  the  vulgar  pagan rabble  as  their  instruments.  Most  of  the  Christian  converts were  from  the  better  classes,  and  the  Politarchs  were  not  dis- posed to  interfere  actively.  But  the  riot  was  a  serious  matter. A  powerful,  dangerous,  lasting  sentiment  was  aroused  in  the class  which  fostered  it  (see  ch.  ii.  14).  The  charge  against Paul  was  that  of  treason  ag^nst  the  Emperor,  and  the  Poli- tarchs were  forced  to  take  active  measures  lest  they  should incur  the  charge  of  condoning  treason.  Their  course  was  the mildest  for  which  they  could  find  precedent.  The  accused were  bound  over  to  keep  the  peace,  and  as  security  was exacted  from  Jason  and  the  leading  Christians  of  Thessa- lonica, it  implied  that  they  were  under  obligation  to  prevent Paul  from  coming  to  the  city  again.  Paul,  after  his  departure,  was  distressed,  lest  his  converts, who  had  been  only  partially  instructed,  might  fall  from  their faith.  He  had  twice  made  the  attempt  to  revisit  them,  but in  vain.  He  had  sent  Timothy  to  inquire  into  their  condition and  to  establish  and  comfort  them  (iii.  2).  Timothy  had  now rejoined  him  at  Corinth,  and  the  information  which  he  brought called  forth  the  first  letter.  The  letter,  though  official,  is  not  stiff  nor  condescending.   rNTBODUGmOK  TO  THB  THBS8ALONIAN  SPIBTLB8.         5  It  reveals  a  quick,  intelligent  sympathy  with  the  burdens  and sufferings  of  the  church,  and  a  full  appreciation  of  their patience  and  fidelity.  They  are  the  subject  of  the  Apostle's thoughts,  wishes,  and  prayers ;  they  are  Ids  joy  and  his  crown. The  tone  of  the  Epistle,  while  peculiarly  affectionate,  is  never- theless decided,  and  exacting  in  moral  demand.  It  has  nothing of  the  legal  or  ecclesiastical  character.  It  is  pervaded,  in  parts, with  the  tension  and  anxiety  of  the  interval  between  Paul's departure  from  Thessalonica  and  the  reception  of  Timothy's report.  Timothy's  news  had  been  substantially  good.  The church  had  remained  true  to  the  faith  against  all  assaults. But  a  degree  of  mistrust  had  arisen  concerning  the  sincerity of  Paul's  interest  for  the  church,  which  must  have  come  from the  outside.  Accordingly  in  the  second  chapter  he  takes on  an  apologetic  tone.  Some  lack  of  religious  steadfastness among  the  members  has  made  itself  evident,  and  some  signs  of not  fully  appreciating  the  relations  of  their  faith  to  Christian morality.  There  has  arisen  a  tendency  to  assume  that  the second  coming  of  Christ  is  close  at  hand,  and  that  all  old relations  and  duties  are  therefore  done  away.  On  the  other hand,  an  opposite  tendency  has  shown  itself,  a  reaction against  the  enthusiasm  evoked  by  the  expectation  of  the parousia,  which  calls  for  the  admonitions, /^Quench  not  the spirit :  despise  not  prophesyings :  prove  all  things :  hold  fast that  which  is  good.\"  Mistakes  have  become  current  respect- ing the  lot  of  such  Christians  as  may  die  before  the  Lord's coming.  There  is  a  possible  hint  of  strained  relations  with the  church-superintendents  (v.  12-15)  and  of  occasions  given to  the  enemies  of  Christianity  for  malicious  criticism  (iv.  12). But  the  main  objects  of  the  letter  are,  to  strengthen  the  bond between  the  writer  and  the  church,  to  detach  the  church  from the  errors  and  abominations  of  heathen  life,  and  to  correct misunderstandings  and  give  comfort  as  regards  the  dead in  Christ.  The  language  of  the  letter  is  simple,  taking  on  a  rhetorical character  only  in  certain  isolated  passages  (ii.  19  f. ;  iii.  8  f.). It  is  not  without  picturesqueness  (i.  8,  9;  ii.  1,  6, 16, 17, 19, iii.  3,  8,  11;  iv.  1,  6,  12;  v.  2,  3,  6,  8,  19).     There  is  an   6         INTBODUCTION  TO  THE  THBSSALONLAN  EPI8TLBS.  occasional  tendency  to  amplification  (i.  2  f.,  8 ;  ii.  11,  13 : iii.  2, 7,  9, 10 ;  v.  1,  8,  6,  28,  etc.))  and  to  round  off  the  ends of  sentences  with  adverbial  phrases  (i.  6,  6;  ii.  2,  16,  17; iii.  8, 9,  etc.).  There  is  to  be  noted  the  frequent  introduction of  expressions  which  recognise  the  knowledge  and  remem- brance of  the  writer's  correspondents,  as  Ka$w^  olBare  even  a9 ye  know:  also  the  forms  of  adjuration  and  comparison  (ii.  5, 10 ;  iii.  6).  A  certain  ruggedness  and  lack  of  symmetry  in the  structure  of  sentences  appears  at  times  (i.  2  ff.,  8 ;  ii.  10 ff.,  17  f.,  19  f.;  iv.  1  f.,  8  ff.}.  The  vocabulary  is  relatively small.     Repetitions  and  similarities  of  expression  occur.  There  are  no  citations  from  the  Old  Testament,  and  no  use of  apocryphal  writings  can  be  shown.  The  mode  of  expression is  thoroughly  Pauline.  The  character  of  the  Epistle  does  not lead  us  to  expect  many  of  the  technical  terms  of  the  Pauline dogmatic;  but  such  as  we  do  find  are  Pauline,  as  ifcXoyi^ election;  teaXetv  to  caU;  i^ioi  eainte;  ayuurfM/fk  eanetification ; fn^  ej&frc?  riv  de6v  not  knowing  God.  There  are  also  to  be noted  the  characteristic  play  of  words  (ii.  4);  paradox  (i.  6); mixed  metaphor  (v.  6),  and  antithesis  of  prepositions  (i.  5 ; iv.  7;  ii.  8,  etc.).  There  are  relatively  few  hapaxlegomena, some  peculiar  uses  of  words  common  in  the  New  Testament; possibly  a  dozen  words  and  modes  of  expression  which  appear only  in  the  deutero-Pauline  writings,  and  a  few  which  are almost  exclusively  confined  to  the  writings  of  Luke  and  the Epistle  to  the  Hebrews.  The  authenticity  of  the  Epistle  is  generally  conceded.  It has  been  assailed  by  Baur,  Steck,  Holsten,  and  Lfoman.  THE  SECOND  EPISTLE.  The  authenticity  and  genuineness  of  this  Epistle  have been  challenged  since  the  beginning  of  the  present  century.* Its  integrity  has  also  been  questioned  on  the  assumed  ground of  a  combination  of  a  genuine  Pauline  epistle  with  interpo- lated matter  (P.  W.  Schmidt).      It  has  been  ascribed  to  •  J.  £.  C.

Attempts  have  also  been  made  to  prove  that  it was  earlier  in  date  than  the  first  Epistle  (Ewald,  Baur, Davidson) ;  but  there  seems  to  be,  on  the  whole,  no  suf- ficient reason  for  refusing  it  a  place  among  the  genuine Pauline  Epistles.  The  external  testimony  in  its  favor  is ancient  and  good,  while  the  resemblances  in  manner  and phraseology  to  the  other  Pauline  writings  cannot  be  evaded. The  vocabulary  is  Pauline.  The  list  of  non-Pauline  words is  small  and  not  important.  As  distinguished  from  all  other Pauline  letters,  the  two  Thessalonian  epistles  exhibit  a striking  relationship,  extending  to  sequences  of  thought, articulation  of  sentences,  and  peculiar  expressions  and usages.  In  not  a  few  cases,  the  same  subjects  are  treated with  almost  the  same  words.*  Both  letters  have  an  eschato- logical  drift ;  both  exhibit,  wiiihout  specially  emphasising  it, the  writer's  apostolic  consciousness ;  both  treat  moral  ques- tions from  the  religious  point  of  view.f  The  second  Epistle  appears  to  have  been  written  some months  after  the  first,  because  of  some  later  information received  by  Paul,  who  was  probably  still  in  Corinth.  The circumstances  of  the  church  were  substantially  the  same, although  there  appears  to  have  been  a  growth  in  faith  and charity  (i.  3,  4) ;  but  the  idea  of  the  imminent  second coming  of  the  Lord  had  assumed  such  proportions  as  to cause  restlessness  and  impatience,  and  a  measure  of  social disorganisation  and  fanaticism.  A  spurious  epistle  in  Paul's name,  announcing  the  immediate  advent  of  the  Lord,  appears to  have  been  circulated  (ii.  2).  The  main  design  of  this second  letter  is  to  correct  false  views  concerning  the  second advent,  and  to  rebuke  the  idleness  and  disorder  into  which some  of  the  Thessalonian  Christians  had  fallen.  •  Comp.,  for  instance,  2  Th.  i.  1-7  ;  ii.  13-17  ;  iii.  1,  8,  12,  and  1  Th.  i.  8, 4f.,  6,  7 ;  U.  13,  15,  16;  iii  8,  4,  6,  8,  0,  10,  11,  12.  t  The  authenticity  of  the  2d  Epistle  is  defended  by  Jowett,  Qodet,  Weiss, Ltinemann,  Schenkel,  Beuss,  Bleek,  Kenan,  Salmon,  Klttpper,  Jttlicher, Bornemann,  Zahn,  McOiifert.

Clement's  Epistle  to  the  Corinthians :  perhaps  a  little  more on  those  in  the  Ignatian  Epistles,  although  many  of  these  are merely  analogies  of  expression  which  may  have  been  acci- dental, or  echoes  of  current  religious  phraseology.  An unmistakable  reminiscence  appears  in  Polycarp's  Epistle  to the  Philippians  (Philip,  iv;  1  Tim.  vi.  7,  10).  There  are no  echoes  in  Hermas  or  in  the  Didache,  and  none  of  import- ance in  Barnabas.  Justin  Martyr  has  a  few  characteristic expressions  of  the  Pastorals,  which  may  be  only  accidental coincidences.  The  Muratorian  Canon  enrols  the  three  as canonical,  and  expressly  justifies  their  reception  because, being  private  letters,  their  canonicity  might  be  called  in question.  They  are  found  in  the  Peshitto  and  Old  Latin Versions,  and  are  accepted  and  cited  as  Pauline  by  Clement of  Alexandria,  Irenaeus,  and  Tertullian.  At  the  end  of  the second  century  they  have  a  recognised  place  among  the Pauline  Epistles.  It  is,  however,  significant,  that  they  were excluded  from  Marcion's  Canon.  It  cannot  be  positively affirmed  that  Marcion  knew  them,  although  his  acquaintance with  them  would  seem  to  be  implied  by  Tertullian  (Adv. Mare.  v.  21),  who  says  that  it  was  strange  how  Marcion could  have  accepted  a  letter  written  to  one  man  (Philemon), and  have  rejected  the  two  to  Timothy  and  the  one  to  Titus. On  the  assumption  that  they  were  known  to  Marcion,  it is  said  that  he  cut  and  carved  the  New  Testament  Scriptures to  suit  his  own  views,  and  that  there  was  therefore  nothing strange  in  his  rejecting  the  Pastorals.  But  besides  rejecting the  whole  of  the  New  Testament  with  the  exception  of  ten Epistles  of  Paul  and  the  Gospel  of  Luke  which  he  mutilated, Marcion  applied  the  knife  to  the  Pauline  Epistles.  In  view of  his  reverence  for  Paul  as  the  only  true  apostle  and  rep- resentative of  Jesus  Christ,  and  for  Paul's  Epistles  as  con- taining the  only  true  gospel, — it  is  strange  that,  knowing the  Pastorals  as  Pauline,  he  should  have  rejected  them  en nuuae^  instead  of  merely  altering  or  abridging  them  to  suit himself.  Tatian  also  rejected  the  two  letters  to  Timothy, but  accepted  Titus,  because  it  contained  nothing  adverse  to ascetic  practices.   INTBODUCnON  TO  THF  PASTORAL  EPISTLES.  187  rV.  Chbonological  Considerations.  —  Was  Paul  re- leased from  his  first  imprisonment  and  imprisoned  a  second time?  Can  a  place  be  found  for  the  three  letters  in  his recorded  history  ?  It  is  claimed  that  Paul  was  released  from  prison  after  his first  confinement  at  Rome  (Acts  xxviii.  16-81)  and  that  he then  continued  his  missionary  labours  in  Ephesus,  Epirus, Macedonia,  and  Crete :  that  he  was  again  arrested  and  im- prisoned, and  that  the  second  imprisonment  was  terminated by  his  execution.  Of  this  there  is  no  sound  historical  evidence  whatever. The  narrative  of  Acts  leaves  him  in  his  first  confinement. The  ordinary  course  of  argument  forms  a  circle.  The  hy- pothesis of  a  second  imprisonment  can  be  sustained  only  by the  Pastoral  Epistles  if  they  are  authentic.  Their  authentic- ity can  be  shown  only  on  that  hypothesis.  The  only  evidence adduced  for  the  second  imprisonment  outside  of  these  letters is,  1.  A  passage  in  Clement's  Epistle  to  the  Corinthians  (V.)) as  follows :  (Paul)  \"  having  preached  the  gospel  both  in  the Ektst  and  in  the  West,  received  the  glorious  renown  due  to  his faith,  having  taught  righteousness  to  the  whole  world,  and having  come  to  the  boundary  of  the  West,  and  having  borne his  testimony  before  the  rulers.  Thus  he  departed  out  of the  world.''  The  main  point  is  having  come  to  the  boundary of  the  Weit  (Arl  to  r^p/ui  rrj^  Svo-eoi?  iX0a>v).  It  is  claimed that  this  expression  refers  to  Spain,  and  that  Clement  thus records  the  fulfilment  of  the  apostle's  intention  stated  in Rom.  XV.  24,  28.  Others,  however,  hold  that  it  refers  to Rome.*  Apart  from  this  difference,  which  it  is  impossible to  settle,  the  whole  statement  is  general,  vague,  and  rhe- torical, and  has  no  historical  value.  2.  The  Muratorian  Canon  (about  170  a.d.)  contains  a passage  apparently  to  the  effect  that  Luke  relates  to  The- ophilus  the  things  which  fell  under  his  own  notice,  and  evi- dently declares  as  apart  from  his  purpose  the  martyrdom  of   •  All  that  ean  be  said  in  fayoor  of  the  reference  to  Spain,  is  said  by Bp.  Lightfoot,  8.  Clement  of  Borne,  ad  loc.   188  INTRODUCTION  TO  THB  PASTORAL  EPISTLES.  Peter ;  but  the  departure  of  Paul  setting  out  from  the  city to  Spain  —  here  the  text  is  mutilated.  How  the  writer intended  to  complete  it  can  only  be  guessed.  The  passage is  worthless  as  evidence.  8.  After  these  two  we  have  noth- ing until  the  fourth  century,  when  Eusebius  says  that  there was  a  tradition  that  the  apostle  again  set  forth  to  the  minis- try of  his  preaching,  and  having  a  second  time  entered  the same  city  of  Rome,  was  perfected  by  his  martyrdom  before Nero.  That  in  this  imprisonment  he  wrote  the  second  Epistle to  Timothy  (JT.  E,  ii.  22,  25).  This  is  all.  Jerome  merely echoes  Eusebius.  Eusebius  does  not  mention  Spain.  His- tory does  not  show  any  apostolic  foundation  in  Spain.  Nei- ther Irenaeus,  Caius,  TertuUian,  nor  Origen  allude  to  such a  mission;  and  although  Irenaeus,  TertuUian,  and  Origen mention  the  death  of  Paul  at  Rome,  they  say  nothing  of  any journeys  subsequent  to  his  first  arrival  there.  Dr.  McGiffert remarks  (note  on  Euseb.  ii.  22,  2):  \"The  strongest  argu- ment against  the  visit  to  Spain  is  the  absence  of  any  trace  of it  in  Spain  itself.  If  any  church  there  could  have  claimed the  great  apostle  to  the  Gentiles  as  its  founder,  it  seems that  it  must  have  asserted  its  claim,  and  the  tradition  have been  preserved  at  least  in  that  church.\"  It  is  also  said  that  2  Tim.  iv.  16, 17  implies  that  Paul  had had  a  hearing  and  been  discharged  and  permitted  to  preach. The  assumption  is  entirely  gratuitous.  The  words  may liave  referred  to  a  hearing  during  his  first  captivity,  when he  was  delivered  from  imminent  danger,  but  not  set  at liberty.  In  short,  historical  evidence  for  a  release  from  the  first Roman  imprisonment,  a  subsequent  missionary  activity,  and a  second  imprisonment,  is  utterly  wanting.  It  seems  hardly conceivable  that  no  traces  of  a  renewed  ministry  should  be left  in  history  except  these  instructions  to  friends  and  pupils. If  Paul  was  Uberated  from  his  first  imprisonment,  it  is  singu- lar that  Luke  should  not  have  recorded  the  fact  as  a  triumph of  the  gospel.  Such  being  the  case,  it  remains  only  to  find  a  place  for  these letters  in  the  recorded  ministry  of  Paul.      This  cannot  be   INTRODUCTION   TO  THE  PASTORAL  EPISTLES.  189  done.     There  is  no  period  of  that  ministry,  from  Damascus to  Rome,  into  which  they  will  fit.*  V.  Style  and  Diction.  — The  most  formidable  objection to  the  Pauline  authorship  of  these  Epistles  is  furnished  by their  style  and  diction,  which  present  a  marked  contrast  with those  of  the  Pauline  letters.  That  the  three  Pastorals  con- tain 148  words  which  appear  nowhere  else  in  the  N.  T.,  and 304  which  are  not  found  in  Paul's  writings,  are  facts  which, by  themselves,  must  not  be  allowed  too  much  weight.  Hap- axlegomena  are  numerous  in  the  several  Pauline  Epistles. Second  Corinthians  has  about  90 :  Romans  and  1st  Corin- thians each  over  a  hundred :  Ephesians  about  40.  That words  like  TroXt/reXi;?  and  oUovpyik  appear  in  the  Pastorals and  not  in  Paul,  counts  for  no  more  than  that  6X0x6X179 occurs  only  in  1st  Thessalonians,  and  afiapi^^  only  in  2d Corinthians.  But  we  are  not  dealing  with  individual  letters,  but  with  a group  of  letters,  nearly,  if  not  absolutely,  contemporaneous. It  i$  a  striking  fact  that  this  entire  group,  closely  allied  in all  its  three  parts  in  vocabulary  and  style,  presents,  as  a whole,  such  marked  variations  in  these  particulars  from  the accepted  Pauline  letters.  In  their  lexical  peculiarities  the Pastorals  form  a  class  by  themselves.  One  who  is  thoroughly  steeped  in  Paulas  style  and  diction, and  who  reads  these  letters  out  of  hand,  is  at  once  impressed with  the  difference  from  Paul.  He  feels  that  he  is  in  a  strange rhetorical  atmosphere.  The  sentences  have  not  the  familiar ring.  The  thought  does  not  move  with  the  accustomed  rush. The  verve  of  Corinthians  and  Gralatians,  the  dialectic  vigour of  Romans,  the  majesty  of  Ephesians,  are  alike  wanting.  The association  of  ideas  is  loose,  the  construction  is  not  compact, the  movement  is  slow  and  clumsy.     We  miss  the  heavily-  •  This  is  succinctly  shown  by  Edwin  Hatch,  in  his  article  **  Pastoral  Epis- tles,\" in  the  Encyclopaedia  Britannica  ;  and  more  in  detail  by  von  Soden,  in his  introduction  to  the  Pastorals  in  the  Hand-Cammentar.  The  most  recent defence  of  the  opposite  view  is  by  J.  Vernon  Bartlett,  The  Apostolic  Age^  lov9.   190  INTBODUCTION  TO  THE  PASTORAL  EPISTLES.  freighted  utterance  of  Paul.  The  thought  is  scanty  in  pro- portion to  the  volume  of  words ;  as  Holtzmann  says :  ^^  We miss  those  characteristic  dam-ireakinffi  which  the  construction suffers  from  the  swelling  fulness  of  thought.\"  We  miss  the frequent  anacolutha,  the  unclosed  parentheses,  the  sudden digressions,  the  obscurities  arising  from  the  headlong  impe- tus of  thought  and  feeling.  The  construction  of  sentences is  simple,  the  thoughts  are  expressed  without  adornment, everything  is  according  to  rule  and  easy,  but  without  mo- mentiun  or  colour.  Strange  compounds,  great,  swelling words,  start  up  in  our  path:  a  Pauline  thought  appears in  a  strange  dress :  the  voice  is  the  voice  of  Jacob,  but  the hands  are  the  hands  of  Esau.  Some  of  these  unusual  compounds,  for  which  the  writer  has a  great  liking,  occur  neither  in  the  N.  T.  nor  in  profane  Greek. High-sounding  words  are  chosen  where  simpler  terms  would have  suited  the  thought  better.  It  seems,  occcusionally,  as  if the  diction  were  being  employed  to  pad  the  meag^eness  of the  thought.  A  class  of  words  which  occur  principally  in  the Pauline  letters  is  wanting,  as  &8iko^,  uKaOapala^  aKpofivarla^ jvmpi^eiv,  Bui0iJK7ff  irepiirareiv^  Xp^onfe,  and  a&fia^  which,  in the  four  principal  Epistles  alone,  Paul  uses  71  times.  We miss  entire  families  of  Pauline  words,  as  ikevOepo^^  <^pov€lv^ irpdaaeiv^  r^Xeio^^  ivepyeiv^  Tre/Mcrcrrf?,  and  the  numerous  deriv- atives and  compounds  growing  out  of  these.  Again,  we  look  in  vain  for  certain  expressions  most  charac- teristic of  the  Pauline  vocabulary,  as  inraKoveiv^  airoKaXihrTeiv^ KavxaaOcu^  and  their  kindred  words.  Still  more  significant  is the  fact  that  the  article,  which  is  freely  used  by  Paul  before entire  sentences,  adverbs,  interjections,  numerals,  and  espe- cially before  the  infinitive,  is  never  so  employed  in  the  Pastor- als. Tot)  with  the  infinitive  disappears.  The  prepositions, the  conjunctions,  and  especially  the  particles  are  quite  differ- ently handled.  The  lively  7^^  appears  oftener  in  the  Epistle to  the  Gralatians  than  in  all  the  three  Pastorals.  The  move- ment of  the  Pauline  thought  indicated  by  &pa  and  Spa  oiv  is lacking.

See  Gal.  i.  1 ;  Rom.  i.  17.  Similar  ideas  are  differently  expressed  by  Paul  and  in  the Pastorals.

Paul  uses  6vTto^  only  adverbially  (see  1  Cor.  xiv. 25 ;  Gal.  iii.  21) :  in  the  Pastorals  it  is  prefixed  to  a  substant- ive, and  converted  into  an  adjective  by  means  of  an  article, and  is  used  only  in  this  way,  a  construction  unknown  to  Paul (see  1  Tim.  v.  8,  6, 16 ;  vi.  19).  To  these  should  be  added  expressions  in  all  the  three  Epis- tles which  indicate  a  peculiar  mode  of  thought  and  of  liter- ary expression  on  the  part  of  the  writer.

Also  designations  like  avOpanroi KaT€<l)0ap/JLdvoi  corrupt  men;  apOponro^  Oeov  man  of  God;  con- structions like  hutfieficuovaBax  irepi  tipo^  to  affirm  concerning something;  and  the  introduction  of  examples  by  &v  iarlv  of whom  are.  Many  more  might  be  added  to  these,*  but  these  are  amply sufficient  to  show  the  wide  gulf  which  separates  the  vocabul- ary and  style  of  these  letters  from  those  of  Paul.  By  way  of  explaining  away  these  facts  we  are  reminded that  these  are  private  letters ;  but  even  in  his  private  letters a  man  does  not  so  entirely  abjure  his  literary  peculiarities.   •  Full  listB  of  peculiarities  of  style  and  dietiou  wiU  be  found  in  Holtzmann, Die  PastorMHife,  ch.  VIL   192  INTRODUCTION  TO  THE  PASTORAL  EPI8TLBS.  and  the  letter  to  Philemon  exhibits  no  lack  of  distinctive Pauline  characteristics.  It  is  further  urged  that  Paul's  style  had  developed,  and that,  in  his  advanced  age,  he  had  lost  the  vivacity  once  pecul- iar to  him.  One  is  tempted  to  smile  at  the  suggestion  of  a development  of  style  in  the  easy  commonplaces  of  these  Epis- tles over  the  nervous  vigour  of  Romans,  the  racy  incisiveness of  Galatians  and  2d  Corinthians,  and  the  majestic  richness  of Ephesians.  As  to  a  decline  on  account  of  age,  Paul,  on  this showing,  must  have  aged  very  rapidly.  He  styles  himself \"  the  aged  \"  in  Philem.  9.  Colossians  was  written  at  the  same time  with  Philemon,  and  Philippians  and  Ephesians  shortly before  or  after.  The  Pastorals  (assuming  Paul's  authorship) cannot  have  been  written  more  than  three  or  four  years  later than  these ;  but  the  Epistles  of  the  Captivity  certainly  betray no  lack  of  vigour,  and  exhibit  no  signs  of  senility  ;  and  the differences  between  these  and  the  Pastorals  are  far  g^reater than  between  the  former  and  Paul's  earliest  letters,  written ten  years  before.  The  production  of  an  old  man  may  indeed exhibit  a  lack  of  energy  or  a  carelessness  of  style,  but  an  old writer  does  not  abandon  his  favorite  words  or  his  characteristic turns  of  expression.  After  following  Paul  for  a  dozen  years through  ten  Epistles,  all  marked  by  the  essential  features  of  his style,  one  finds  it  hard  to  believe  that  he  should  suddenly  be- come a  writer  of  an  entirely  different  type,  ignoring  his  own characteristic  and  favorite  modes  of  expression.  Surely  the themes  treated  in  the  Pastorals  would  have  furnished  abundant occasion  for  vm  Oeov^  aTrokvrpwn^^  vio0€<rla^  Sueaioavprj  deovy and  Bueaui(Oy  which  occurs  only  twice,  and  in  one  of  these instances  is  applied  to  Christ.  VI.  As  to  the  character  of  the  teaching,  it  is  possible  that the  divergence  of  the  teaching  and  of  the  Christian  ideal  of the  Pastorals  from  those  of  the  Pauline  Epistles  may  have been  somewhat  exaggerated.  On  a  fair  construction,  the Pastorals  may  be  said  to  contain  the  essentials  of  the  Pauline teaching,  expressed  or  implied.  More  exaggerated,  however, is  the  claim  of  Godet  and  Findlay,  that  the  Pastorals  repre-   INTRODUCTION  TO  THE  PASTORAL  EPISTLES.  198  sent  an  advanced  and  rounded  expression  of  Pauline  teach- ing, ^^  bringing  the  doctrines  of  grace  to  a  rounded  f uhiess and  chastened  ripeness  of  expression  that  warrants  us  in  see- ing in  them  the  authentic  conclusion  of  the  Pauline  gospel of  salvation  in  the  mind  which  first  conceived  if  (Findlay).  No  special  pleading  can  get  round  the  clear  difference between  the  types  of  Christianity  and  of  Christian  teaching as  set  forth  in  the  Pastorals  and  in  the  Pauline  Epistles ; between  the  modes  of  presenting  the  doctrine  of  salvation and  the  relative  emphasis  on  its  great  factors.  The  death  and  resurrection  of  Christ  are  matters  of  allusion rather  than  central  truths.  As  regards  resurrection,  the Pastoi*als  resemble  the  Epistle  to  the  Hebrews.  The  vital union  of  the  believer  with  Christ,  which  is  the  essence  of Paul's  Christian  ideal,  may  possibly  be  implied,  but  is  not emphasised,  and  certainly  does  not  underlie  the  Pastoral teaching.  The  conception  of  Justification  is  not  sharply defined.  Aucaiovv  occurs  but  twice,  and  in  one  of  the  cases  is predicated  of  Christ  (1  Tim.  iii.  16).  The  teaching  is  pre- dominantly ethical.  Its  two  key-notes  are  practical  piety and  sound  doctrine.  ^Evadfieia  piety  or  godline$8  plays  the part  which  is  borne  by  'irUm^  faith  in  the  Paulines.  TlUmji does  not  occupy  the  commanding  and  central  position  whiclf it  does  in  Paul's  teaching.  Only  in  1  Tim.  i.  16 ;  2  Tim. iii.  16,  does  faith  clearly  appear  as  the  means  of  the  subject- ive appropriation  of  salvation.  In  Tit.  iii.  5,  just  where  we should  expect  it,  we  do  not  find  faith  set  sharply  over  against righteousness  by  works.  Faith  is  emphasised  as  confiding acknowledgment  of  the  truth,  and  sometimes  as  the  virtue of  fidelity.  See  1  Tim.  v.  12  ;  Tit.  ii.  10.  It  appears  either as  one  of  the  cardinal  virtues  following  in  the  train  of  eva^ fieia^  or  as  the  acknowledgment  of  the  teaching  in  which €vaifi€ui  finds  expression.  These  Epistles  deal  much  with  the  character  and  attributes of  God,  and  exhibit  them  in  terms  which  are  mostly  foreign to  Paul,  such  as  Q-od  our  Saviour.  This,  however,  may  have been  partly  due  to  the  false  representations  of  contemporary heresies.     I  cannot  but  feel  that  there  is  too  much  truth  in  VOL.  IV. — 18   194  Il^TBODUCTION   TO  THS  PA8TOBAL  EPISTLBS.  the  remark  of  Schenkel,  that  ^^  the  image  of  Christ  presented in  the  Pastorals  is  indeed  composed  of  Pauline  formulas,  but is  lacking  in  the  Pauline  spirit  and  feeling,  in  the  mystic inwardness,  the  religious  depth  and  moral  force,  that  live  in the  Christ  of  Paul.\"  Still,  the  Pauline  conception  appears in  the  emphasis  upon  the  manhood  of  Christ  (1  Tim.  ii.  5 ; 2  Tim.  ii.  8),  and  the  clear  implication  of  his  preexistence (1  Tim.  i.  15 ;  iii.  16 ;  2  Tim.  i.  10).  In  1  Tim.  iii.  16  the representation  is  nearer  to  that  of  John.  VII.  The  Weitbb's  Allusions  to  himself  and  his Companions.  —  Grave  suspicions  as  to  the  Pauline  author- ship are  awakened  by  the  writer's  mode  of  speaking  of  him- self, and  to  intimate  and  trusted  companions  and  disciples like  Timothy  and  Titus.  We  know  how  near  these  two  were to  him,  and  how  he  confided  in  them  (see  Philip,  ii.  19-22). It  is  strange  that  in  writing  to  them  he  should  find  it  neces- sary to  announce  himself  formally  as  an  apostle  of  Jesus Christ  (comp.  Philemon,  BArfuo^  prisaner^^  just  as  to  the  Gala- tians,  who  had  impugned  his  apostolic  authority,  or  to  the Romans,  to  whom  he  was  personally  a  stranger.  Such  an announcement  is  singularly  out  of  place  in  a  private  letter, even  though  official.  Equally  strange  is  his  assuring  such friends  that  he  is  appointed  of  God  to  be  a  herald  of  the gospel ;  that  he  speaks  the  truth  and  does  not  lie ;  that  he has  served  God  from  his  fathers  with  a  pure  conscience.  One might  doubt  his  entire  confidence  in  these  trusted  ministerial helpers  and  personal  friends,  when  he  feels  it  incumbent  upon him  to  commend  to  them  the  most  elementary  and  self-evident duties,  as  abstinence  from  youthful  lusts.  It  is  singular  that he  should  exhort  Timothy  to  let  no  man  despise  his  youth, when  Timothy  had  attended  him  for  at  least  thirteen  years, and  must  have  been  a  mature  man.  And  if  Paul,  before writing  1st  Timothy  and  Titus,  had  recently  been  with  them both  (1  Tim.  i.  8  ;  Tit.  i.  5),  and  had  given  them  their  com- missions by  word  of  mouth,  why  does  he  do  the  same  thing so  soon  after,  especially  when  he  is  looking  forward  to  a speedy  reunion  (1  Tim.  iii.  14 ;   Tit.  iii.  12)  ?    Why  does   INTRODUCTION  TO  THE  PASTORAL  EPISTLES.  195  he  picture  the  Cretans  in  such  detail  to  Titus,  who  was  in  ih» midst  of  them,  and  who  must  have  known  their  characteris- tics quite  as  well  as  himself  ?  VIII.  The  Heresies.  —  Before  it  can  be  decisively asserted  that  the  heresies  treated  in  these  Epistles  are  later than  Paul's  time,  it  must  be  settled  what  these  heresies  were, and  this,  with  our  present  knowledge,  is  impossible.  There are  almost  as  many  different  views  as  there  are  critics.  In the  Epistles  themselves  the  statements  regarding  heresies  are general  and  sweeping,  and,  taken  together,  do  not  point  to any  particular  system.  It  would  seem  that  the  writer  was assailing,  not  a  particular  form  of  heresy,  but  a  tendency,  of which  he  does  not  discuss  the  details.  Indeed,  the  allusions to  heresies  appear  intended  principally  to  point  the  exhorta- tions to  hold  fast  sound  teaching  and  the  instructions  con- cerning church  polity,  as  safeguards  against  false  teaching and  immoral  practice.  The  moral  developments  of  the  her- esies, rather  than  their  doctrinal  errors,  are  treated.  Their representatives  are  wicked  men  and  impostors :  they  are deceiving  and  deceived :  they  are  of  corrupt  mind,  destitute of  truth,  with  their  consciences  seared:  they  lead  captive silly  women,  laden  with  sins,  led  away  by  divers  lusts :  they are  greedy  of  gain.  At  the  root  of  the  moral  errors  there seem  to  be  indicated  Gnostic  tendencies  and  Jewish  corrup- tions, and  traits  akin  to  those  which  appear  in  the  Colossian heresy.  All  of  the  writer's  theology  is  anti-Gnostic.  Indi- vidusd  features  of  Gnosticism  can  be  recognised,  but  a  con- sistent reference  throughout  to  Gnosticism  cannot  be  shown.* In  any  case,  it  is  noticeable  how  the  treatment  of  heresies  and false  teachers  differs  from  that  of  Paul.  The  treatment  in the  Pastorals  is  general,  sweeping,  vague,  and  mainly  denun- ciatory. No  vital  differences  between  the  forms  of  error  and between  their  teachers  are  defined,  but  all  are  indiscriminately denounced  as  concerned  with  foolish  and  ignorant  question-  •  See  Pfleiderer,  Urehrittenthum,  p.  801  ff.,  and  Holtmuum,  Die  POMtaral- kri^e^  ch.  IX.   196  INTBODUCTION   TO  THE  PASTORAL   EPISTLES.  ing,  disputes  about  words,  strifes  about  the  law,  fables,  end- less genealogies,  and  profane  babblings.  This  is  quite  unlike the  controversial  method  of  Paul,  who  defines  what  he  assails, demonstrates  its  unsoundness,  and  shows  the  bearing  of  the gospel  upon  it.  IX.  Church  Polity.  —  The  church  polity  of  the  Pastor- als is  of  a  later  date  than  Paul.  Within  the  circle  of  the Pauline  Epistles  there  is  no  trace  of  formally  constituted church  officers.  The  greeting  to  Bishops  and  Deacons  in Philippians  is  unique,  but  it  does  not  imply  a  polity  differing substantially  from  that  exhibited  in  1st  Corinthians  and  1st Thessalonians.  The  greeting  is  to  the  church  first,  and  the special  mention  of  Bishops  and  Deacons  by  way  of  appendage is  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  letter  was  called  out  by  the pecuniary  contribution  of  the  Philippian  church  to  Paul,  of the  collection  and  sending  of  which  these  functionaries  would naturally  have  charge.  The  names  Bishop  and  Deacon  des- ignate functions  and  not  official  titles.  In  the  formal  list,  in Eph.  iv.  11,  of  those  whom  God  has  set  in  the  church,  neither Bishops,  Elders,  nor  Deacons  occur;  and  yet  that  Epistle* was  written  within  a  short  time  of  the  writing  of  the  Philip- pian letter.  The  offices  in  the  Pauline  church  were  charis- matic The  warrant  of  leadership  was  a  divine,  spiritual endowment.  Paul  recognises  certain  function%  as  of  divine institution ;  and  those  functions  are  assumed  in  virtue  of  a special,  divine  gift  in  prophecy,  speaking  with  tongues,  teach- ing, healing,  or  helping,  as  the  case  may  be  (see  1  Cor.  xii). There  is  no  recognition  of  official  distinctions,  or  of  formal appointment  to  definite  offices,  in  the  Pauline  Epistles.  Apos- tles, prophets,  teachers,  powers,  helps,  healings,  kinds  of tongues,  do  not  represent  offices  resting  on  the  appointment of  the  church.  The  Pastorals  recognise  Bishops,  Deacons, and  Presbyters.  The  recognition  of  three  distinct  orders  is not  as  sharp  and  clear  as  in  the  Ignatian  Epistles  (100-118 A.D.),  but  the  polity  is  in  advance  of  that  of  the  Pauline churches  as  set  forth  in  the  Epistles  of  Paul.  The  Pastorals seem  to  mark  a  transition  point  between  the  earlier  republican   INTEODUCTION  TO  THE  PASTORAL  EPISTLES.  197  simplioity  and  the  later  monarchical  tendency.  If  these  let- ters are  the  work  of  Paul  before  his  first  imprisonment,  their notes  of  church  polity  do  not  consist  with  those  of  his  other letters  written  during  that  period.  If  they  were  composed by  Paul  a  few  years  after  his  first  imprisonment,  the  period is  too  early  for  the  change  in  polity  which  they  indicate.  In  view  of  all  these  facts,  it  seems  unlikely  that  these  Epis- tles are  the  work  of  Paul.  The  writer  was  probably  a  Paul- ine Christian  in  the  early  part  of  the  second  century,  who,  in view  of  the  doctrinal  errors  and  moral  looseness  of  his  age, desired  to  emphasise  the  orthodox  doctrine  of  the  church,  to advocate  a  definite  ecclesiastical  polity  as  a  permanent  saf e- gruard  against  error,  and  to  enforce  practical  rides  of  conduct. These  counsels  and  warnings  he  issued  in  the  name  of  Paul, whose  letters  he  evidently  knew,  whose  character  he  revered, and  whose  language  he  tried  to  imitate.  To  this  he  was,  per- haps, moved  by  the  fact  that  contemporary  heretics,  in  some cases,  laid  claim  to  the  authority  of  Paul,  and  in  other  cases openly  repudiated  it.  It  is  probable  that  he  based  these  let- ters upon  genuine  Pauline  material — despatches,  or  fragments of  letters  to  Timothy  and  Titus,  which  had  fallen  into  his hands.  It  may  be  conceded  that  the  letters  have  a  Pauline nucleus.  The  writer  probably  assumed  that  the  addresses  of his  letters  to  Timothy  and  Titus  would  attract  attention  and carry  weight,  since  these  teachers  were  representatives  of churches.  To  stigmatise  such  a  proceeding  as  forgery  is  to  treat  the conditions  of  that  early  time  from  the  point  of  view  of  our own  age.  No  literary  fraud  was  contemplated  by  the  writer or  ascribed  to  him.  The  practice  of  issuing  a  work  in  the name  of  some  distinguished  person  was  common,  and  was  rec- ognised as  legitimate.  A  whole  class  of  writings,  chiefly apocalyptic,  and  known  as  pseudepigraphic  or  pseudonymous, appeared  in  the  times  immediately  preceding  and  succeeding the  beginning  of  the  Christian  era.  Such  were  the  Book  of Enoch,  the  Sibylline  Oracles,  and  the  Psalter  of  Solomon. Precedent  was  furnished  by  the  Old  Testament  writings. The  Psalmists  adopted  the  names  of  David,  Asaph,  and  the   198  INTBODUCnON  TO  THE  PASTORAL  EPISTLES.  Sons  of  Korah.  Neither  Samuel  nor  Ruth  nor  Esther  were supposed  to  be  the  authors  of  the  books  which  bore  their names.  Koheleth,  in  the  Book  of  Ecclesiastes,  impersonates Solomon,  and  the  Proverbs  and  the  Canticles  both  bear  hi^ name.  The  church  of  the  second  century  thankfully  accepted  these three  Epistles,  and,  inferior  though  they  were  in  spiritual power  and  richness  of  idea  to  the  genuine  Pauline  letters  or the  Epistle  to  the  Hebrews,  incorporated  them  with  these among  the  New  Testament  writings.  They  are  valuable  in exhibiting  to  us  certain  features  of  post-Pauline  Christianity. They  testify  to  the  energy  and  purity  of  the  church's  moral impulses  as  nourished  by  the  religious  principles  of  Christen- dom. They  show  us  the  causes  out  of  which  grew  the increased  emphasis  upon  authority  and  external  reg^en. By  their  strong  attestation  of  the  value  of  the  inheritance from  the  apostolic  age,  by  their  high  ethical  character,  based on  religion  and  exhibiting  the  moral  consequences  of  the Christian  faith,  by  their  emphasis  upon  the  practical  rather than  the  doctrinal  edification  of  the  church,  upon  the significance  of  the  church,  and  upon  the  representation  of Christianity  by  Christian  personality  —  they  justify  their canonisation.

Ignatius,  addressing  the  Ephesians, says :  \"  Ye  are  God-bearers,  shrine-bearers,  Christ-bearers  '* (^^  Epistle  to  Ephesians,\"  ix.).  In  the  Antiochene  Acts,  Trajan alludes  to  Ignatius  as  '^the  one  who  declares  that  he  bears about  the  crucified.\"  Ignatius  was  known  as  Beo^po^  Ood bearer^  and  so  styles  himself  in  the  introductions  of  his  epistles.  Dying  {veKpo^av).  Only  here  and  Rom.  iv.  19.  Primarily a  putting  to  deaths  and  thence  the  state  of  deadnesSy  as  Rom.  iv. 19.  Here  in  the  former  sense.

The  daily  liability  to  a  violent  death  is  some- thing which  we  carry  about  with  us.\"  Compare  1  Cor.  xv.  31 ; Rom.  viii.  36.  This  parallel  with  Christ's  death  is  ofFset  by  the parallel  with  Christ^s  triumph — life  through  resurrection.  That  the  life  also  {Jva).  In  order  that.  The  purport,  ac- cording to  Ood's  purpose,  of  this  daily  dying  is  to  set  forth  the resurrection-life  through  Christ  in  us.     Compare  Rom.  v.  10.  13.

Thnnigh  (Swi)  should govern  the  ■nutnxj,  not  tJiank^giving ;  and  redaund  should  be transitive,  cause  to  abound,  and  govemiiig  thankagi-oing.  So Rev.,  the  grace,  being  multipUed  through  the  many,  may  eauae the  thanksgiving  to  abound.  The  thought  is  on  tlie  line  of  ver. 12,  that  the  sufferings  and  risks  of  the  apostles  promote  spirit- ual life  in  the  Church.  The  grace  of  God,  thus  manifest  in the  apostles,  shall  be  multiplied  tiirough  the  increasing  number of  those  who  share  it,  and  shall  thus  make  thanksgiving  more abundant  for  the  fruits  of  this  grace  as  exhibited  in  the  apos- tles and  in  the  Church.  Redound  (A.  V.)  ia  from  the  Latin  redundare  to  surge  hack. Therefore,  primarily,  of  a  fulness  or  overflow  from  the  setting hack  of  a  tide.     So  Milton :  \"  The  evil,  BOOH Driven  buk,  redounded  u  K  flood  on  tbow From  whom  It  ipruig.\"  (Generally,  to  abound.  From  this  arises  the  secondary  sense, to  conduce,  contribute  to;  that  ia,  to  make  the  causes  mount  nji, or  abound,  bo  as  to  produce  the  effect.

The  Sgnre  of  the  tent  suits  the  contrast with  the  hii'Uding,  and  would  naturally  suggest  itself  to  the tent-maker,*  The  phrase  earthly  house  of  the  tabernacle  ex- presses a  single  conception — the  dioeUing  which  ia,  orcotisisls  in the  tabernacle,  the  tent-houae.

Ilegarding  the  coming  of  the  Lord  as near,  the  apostle  contemplates  the  possibility  of  living  to  be- hold it.  The  oppression  of  soul  {groan)  is  not  from  pains  and afflictions  of  the  body,  nor  from  the  fear  of  death,  bnt  from the  natural  shrinkiug  from  death,  especially  if  death  is  to  de- prive hiui  of  the  body  (unclothe)  only  to  leave  him  without  a new  and  liigher  organism.

All  things — all  that  are  involved  in  this mighty  change — are  from  God,  Reconciled.  God  is  the  prime-mover  in  the  work  of  recon- ciliation.    See  on  Bom.  v.  10,  ihnmgh  Christy  as  the  medium.  19.  God.    Emphatic.    It  was  Qod^  as  in  ver.  18.  Was — reconciling  (j)v  KwriMsjiaamf).  These  words  are  to be  construed  together ;  the  participle  with  the  finite  verb  mark- ing the  process  of  i*econciliation.  The  emphasis  is  on  the  fact that  God  was  reconciUng,  not  on  the  fact  that  God  was  in Christ.  Gt)d  was  all  through  and  behind  the  process  of  recon- ciliation. The  primary  reference  of  the  statement  is,  no  doubt, to  God's  reconciling  manifestation  in  the  incarnation  and  death of  Christ ;  yet,  as  a  fact,  it  includes  much  more.  God  was  en- gaged in  reconciling  the  world  from  the  very  beginning,  and that  in  Christ.     See  on  John  i.  4,  5,  9, 10.  Hath  given  to  us  {Sifji^po^  iv  fjiuv).

Whatever  is  revealed in  its  true  essence  by  liglit  is  of  the  nature  of  light.  It  no longer  belongs  to  the  category  of  darkness.  Manifestation  is a  law  of  good  and  evil  alike.  That  which  is  of  the  truth  seeks tiie  light  and  cometh  to  the  light.  That  which  is  evil  avoids the  light,  and  loves  darkness  better  than  light,  but  none  the less  is  brought  to  the  light  and  appears  in  its  own  light.  See John  iii.  20,  21.

Hence,  in  Scripture,  the  loiim  are  de- scribed as  Uie  seat  of  power.  \"To  smite  through  the  loins\"  is to  strike  a  fatal  blow.  \"  To  lay  afBiction  upon  tlie  loins  \"  is  to afflict  heavily.  Here  was  the  point  of  junction  for  the  main pieces  of  the  body-armor,  bo  that  the  girdle  formed  the  common bond  of  the  whole.  Truth  gives  unity  to  the  different  virtnef, and  determinateness  and  consistency  to  cliaracter.  All  the  vir- tnes  are  exercised  within  the  sphere  of  truth.  Breastplate  of  righteousness  (SmpaKa  t^«  SucaiotrtJi^!). Compare  Isa.  li.\\.  17.  IH'jhteoumiess  is  used  here  in  the  eeuse  of moral  rectitude.  In  1  Theas.  v,  8,  the  breastplate  is  described  aa oi  faith  and  love.  Homer  speaks  of  liglit-armed  warriors  anued with  linen  corselets;  and  these  were  worn  to  much  later  times  by Asiatic  soldiers,  and  were  occasionally  adopted  by  the  Romans. Thus  Suetonius  says  of  Galba,  that  on  the  day  on  which  he was  slain  by  Otho's  soldiers,  he  put  on  a  linen  corselet,  though aware  that  it  would  avail  little  against  the  enemy's  daggera {\"  Galba,\"  xix.).  Horn  was  used  for  this  purpose  by  some  of the  barbarona  nations.  It  was  cut  into  small  pieces,  which  were fastened  like  scales  upon  linen  shirts.  Later,  the  corselet  of metal  scales  fastened  upon  leather  or  linen,  or  of  flexible  bands of  steel  folding  over  each  other,  was  introduced.  They  appeai- on  Roman  monuments  of  the  times  of  the  emperors.  The Roman  spearmen  wore  cuirasses  of  chain-mail.  Virgil  mentions those  in  which  tlie  linked  rings  were  of  gold  (\"Aeneid,\"  iii., 467).  The  stiff  cuirass  called  <rra8(09  stariding  upright,  be- cause, when  placed  upon  its  lower  edge  it  stood  erect,  consisted of  two  parts:  the  breastplate,  made  of  hard  leather,  bronze,  or iron,  and  a  corresponding  plate  covering  the  back.  They  were connected  by  leatliern  straps  or  metal  bands  passing  over  the shoulders  and  fastened  in  front,  and  by  hinges  on  the  right side.  The  breastplate  covers  the  vital  parts,  as  the  heart.   i   Cb.  VI.]  THE   EPISTLE  TO   THE  EPHESIAN8,  409  lii.  Preparation  {hoifuiaia).  Only  here  in  the  New  Teata- ineiit.

They  were  not  worn  by  the  superior  officers,  bo  that  the  eoui- mou  soldiers  were  distinguished  as  caligati.

The  shield  of  faith  (rbv  ^peov  tt}^  Tria-Teax;).  Svpeov  shield, is  from  Bvpa  door,  because  shaped  like  a  door.

The  shield  here  described  ia  that  of  the heavy  infantry  ;  a  large,  oblong  shield,  four  by  two  and  a  half feet,  and  sometimes  cnrved  on  the  inner  side.  Sculptured representations  may  be  seen  on  Trajan's  column.  Compare \"  Comjiass  him  as  with  a  shield,\"  Ps,  v.  12.  It  was  made  of wood  or  of  wicker-work,  and  held  on  the  left  arm  by  means  of a  handle.  Xenophou  describes  troops,  supposed  to  be  Egyp- tians, with  wooden  shields  reaching  to  their  feet  (\"Anabasis,\" i.,  8,  9).     Saving  faith  is  meant.  Fiery  darts  (ri  /Sc'Xij  rk  weTrvprnpUva).  Lit.,  the  darts,  those which  have  been  set  on  fire.  Ilerodotns  says  that  the  Persians attacked  the  citadel  of  Athens  '^  with  arrows  whereto  pieces  of lighted  tow  were  attached,  which  they  shot  at  the  barricade\" (viii.,  52).

Compare  Ps.  vii.  13,  where  the  correct  rendering ia,  \"  His  arrows  He  maketh  fiery  arrows.\"  Temptation  is  thus represented  as  impelled  from  a  distance.  Satan  attacks  by  in- direction— through  good  things  from  which  no  evil  is  suspected, Thei-e  is  a  hint  of  its  propagating  power :  one  sin  draws  an- other in  its  track:  the  flamo  of  the  fire-tipped  dart  spreads. Temptation  acts  on  susceptible  material.  Self-confidence  is combustible.  Faith,  in  doing  away  with  dependence  on  self, taltes  away  fuel  for  the  dart.  It  creates  sensitiveTiess  to  holy influences  by  which  the  power  of  temptation  is  neutralized.  It enlists  the  direct  aid  of  God.  See  1  Cor.  x.  13 ;  Luke  xxii.  32 ; Jas.  i.  2;  1  Pet.  iv.  12;  2  Pet.  ii.  9.  17.  Take  the  helmet  of  salvation  (rijp  vepticetpaXaiav  toO ffo)rt}plov  Se'f<w5e).

It  was  furniahed with  a  visor  to  protect  the  face.  Sword  of  the  Spirit  (fuij^eupap  tov  ■jrvevfuntK).  See  on Apoc.  vi.  4.

The  official  designation  is  omitted,  as  in  1  and  2 Thessalonians  and  Philemon.  It  is  not  easy  to  explain  the  use or  omission  of  the  title  apostle  in  all  cases.  Here,  and  in  Phile- mon and  1  Thessalonians,  its  omission  may  be  accounted  for  by the  general,  unofficial,  personal,  affectionate  character  of  the  let- ter. In  2  Corinthians  and  Galatians  the  reason  for  its  use  is apparent  from  the  fact  that  Paul's  official  authority  had  been  as- sailed. But  it  is  also  omitted  in  2  Thessalonians,  which  has  an admonitory  and  rebuking  character.  Its  use  in  the  epistles  to Timothy  and  Titus,  private  letters,  is  explained  by  the  fact  that Paul  is  addressing  them  not  only  as  friends,  but  as  pastors. In  Romans,  while  there  is  no  evidence  of  any  challenge  of  his apostolic  claims,  there  is  an  authoritative  exposition  of  christian doctrine  which  appears  to  warrant  the  title.  Timothy.  Associated  with  Paul  as  in  the  introductions  to 2  Corinthians  and  the  two  Thessalonian  epistles.  Timothy  as- sisted Paul  in  founding  the  Philippian  church.  Acts  xvi.  1, 13 ;  xvii.  14.  Two  visits  of  Timothy  to  Philippi  are  recorded. Acts  xix.  22 ;  xx.  3,  4.  He  is  evidently  preparing  for  a  third visit,  see  ch.  ii.  19.  His  only  part  in  this  letter  is  his  name  in the  salutation,  and  in  ch.  ii.  19.  To  all  the  saints  {irwriv  roU  ofyloisi).  In  Paul's  personal  ad- dresses in  this  epistle  the  word  all  occurs  nine  times.  It  is sufficiently  accounted  for  by  the  expansiveness  of  grateful  christ- ian feeling  which  marks  the  entire  letter,  and  it  is  doubtful   il4  WOED  STUDIES  IN  THE  NKW  TESTAIIENT.

For  saints,  see  on  Col.  i,  2 ; Kora.  i.  7.  The  word  is  transferred  from  the  Old  Testament. The  Israelites  were  called  Syiot  holy,  separated  and  coiKsecrated, Exod.  xix.  6;  Dent.  vii.  6 ;  xiv,  2,  21  ;  Dan.  vii.

Travellers  by  sea  landed  at  Neap- olie,  and  then  travelled  ten  miles  to  Philippi  along  the  Via Egiiatia,  which  traversed  Macedonia  from  east  to  west.  The site  was  originally  occupied  by  a  town  called  Du(us  or  Datum, and  was  known  as  Krtnides  from  its  numerous  springs.  It was  called  PkUippi  in  honor  of  Philip  of  Mucedun,  who  en- larged and  fortified  it.  Its  situation  was  impoi-tant,  command- ing the  great  high  road  between  Europe  and  Asia.  This  fact led  to  its  fortification  by  Philip,  and  made  it,  later,  the  scene of  the  decisive  battle  which  resulted  in  the  defeat  of  Crutiis and  CaasiuB.  Its  soil  was  productive  and  rich  in  mineral  treas- ures, which  had  yielded  a  lai^  revenue,  but  which,  in  Paui'a time,  had  apparently  become  exliausted.  Augnstua  planted  at  Philippi  a  col<mia.  See  on  Acts  xvi. 12.*  A  variety  of  national  types  assembled  there — Greek,  Ro- man, and  Asiatic — representing  different  phases  of  philosophy, religion,  and  superstition.  It  was  therefore  an  appropriate starting-point  for  the  Gospel  in  Europe,  a  field  in  which  it could  demonstrate  its  power  to  deal  with  all  differences  of  na- tion, faith,  sex,  and  social  standing. f  Bishops  [hrtaKOTTOK).

It  is  thus distinct  from  iovKo^  hand-eervcmt.  It  represents  a  servant,  not in  his  relation,  but  in  his  activity.  In  the  epistles  it  is  often used  specifically  for  a  minister  of  the  Gospely  1  Cor.  iii.  5 ;  2  Cor. iii.  6 ;  Eph.  iii.  7.  Here  it  refers  to  a  distinct  class  of  officers in  the  apostolic  church.  The  origin  of  this  office  is  recorded Acts  vi.  1-6.  It  grew  out  of  a  complaint  of  the  Hellenistic  or Graeco-Jewish  members  of  the  Church,  that  their  widows  were neglected  in  the  daily  distribution  of  food  and  alms.  The  Pales- tinian Jews  prided  themselves  on  their  pure  nationality  and looked  upon  the  Oreek  Jews  as  their  inferiors.  Seven  men  were chosen  to  superintend  this  matter,  and  generally  to  care  for  the bodily  wants  of  the  poor.  Their  function  was  described  by  the phrase  to  serve  tables^  Acts  vi.  2,  and  their  appointment  left  the apostles  free  to  devote  themselves  to  prayer  and  the  ministry  of the  word.  The  men  selected  for  the  office  are  supposed  to  have been  Hellenists,  from  the  fact  that  all  their  names  are  Greek, and  one  is  especially  described  as  a  proselyte.  Acts  vi.  5 ;  but this  cannot  be  positively  asserted,  since  it  was  not  uncommon for  Jews  to  assume  Greek  names.  See  on  Bom.  xvi.  5.  The work  of  the  deacons  was,  primarily,  the  relief  of  the  sick  and poor;  but  spiritual  ministrations  naturally  developed  in  con- nection with  their  office.  The  latter  are  referred  to  by  the term  helpSy  1  Cor.  xii.  28.  Stephen  and  Philip  especially  ap- pear in  this  capacity,  Acts  viii.  5-40 ;  vi.  8-11.

Tlieir  term  of  service  waa originally  twelve  years,  afterward  increased  to  sixteen.  On completing  his  term,  each  soldier  received  a  little  over  eight hundred  dollars.  They  alt  seem  to  have  had  the  same  rank  as centurions  in  the  regular  legions.  They  became  the  most  pow- erful body  in  the  state;  the  emperors  were  obliged  to  court their  favor,  and  each  emperor  on  his  accession  was  expected  to bestow  on  tliem  a  liberal  donative.  After  the  death  of  Per- tinax  {a.d,  193}  they  put  up  the  empire  at  public  sale,  and knocked  it  down  to  Didius  Julianns.  They  were  disbanded the  same  year  on  the  accession  of  Severus,  and  were  banished ; but  were  restored  by  tliat  emperor  on  a  new  plan,  and  increased to  four  times  their  original  number.

The  apostle  was  under  the  charge  of  these  troops,  the  soldiers relieving  each  other  in  mounting  guard  over  the  prisoner,  who was  attached  to  his  guard's  hand  by  a  chain.

We  must  here  dismiss  from  our  minds  the  idea  of  shape.

For the  manner  in  which  this  differeuee  is  developed  in  the  kindred verba,  see  on  Matt.  xvii.  3.  As  applied  here  to  God,  the  word  is  intended  to  descrihe  that mode  in  which  the  essential  being  of  God  expresses  itself.  We have  no  word  which  can  convey  this  meaning,  nor  is  it  possible for  DB  to  formulate  the  reality.  Form  inevitably  carries  witli it  to  ns  the  idea  of  shape.  It  ie  conceivable  that  the  essential personality  of  God  may  express  itself  in  a  mode  apprehensible by  the  perception  of  pure  spiritual  intelligences;  but  the  mode itself  is  neither  apprehensible  nor  conceivable  by  human miiida.  This  mode  of  expression,  this  setting  of  the  divine  essence,  is not  identical  with  the  essence  itself,  but  is  identified  with  it^  as its  natural  and  appropriate  expression,  answering  to  it  in  every particular.  It  \\b  tlie  perfect  expression  of  a  perfect  essence. It  is  not  something  imposed  from  without,  but  something  which proceeds  from  the  very  depth  of  the  perfect  being,  and  into which  that  being  perfectly  unfolds,  as  light  from  tire.  To  say,  then,  that  Christ  was  in  thsfonn  of  God^  is  to  say that  He  existed  as  essentially  one  with  God.  The  expression of  deity  through  human  nature  (ver.  7)  thns  has  its  background in  the  expression  of  deity  (W  deitij  in  the  eternal  ages  of  God'a being.  Whatever  the  mode  of  this  expression,  it  marked  the being  of  Christ  in  the  eternity  before  creation.  As  the_/orTO of  God  was  identified  with  the  heiny  of  God,  so  Christ,  being in  the  form  of  God,  was  identified  with  the  being,  nature,  and personality  of  God.  Thisyb/Tn,  not  being  idetifical  with  the  divine  essence,  but dependent  upon  it,  and  necessarily  implying  it,  can  be  parted with  or  laid  aside.  Since  Christ  is  one  with  God,  and  therefore pure  being,  absolute  existence.  lie  can  exist  without  the  form. This  form  of  God  Christ  laid  aside  in  Ilia  incarnation.  ",

On  this  explanation  tlie  statement  is  very  awkward.  Christ, being  in  the  form  of  God,  did  not  think  it  robbery  to  be  equal with  God  ;  hut,  after  which  we  should  naturally  expect,  on  the other  hand,  claimed  and  asserted  equality :  whereas  the  state- ment is :  Chriat  was  in  th«fortn  of  Ood  and  did  not  think  it robbery  to  be  equal  with  God,  but  (instead)  ejnj)tied  ITiniself, Christ  held  fast  Ilis  aseertion  of  divine  dignity,  but  relinqnished it.     The  antithesis  is  thus  entirely  destroyed.  Taking  the  word  apirofyfiov  (A.  V.,  robbery)  to  mean  a  highly jffized  j>ossesaitni,  we  understand  Paul  to  say  that  Christ,  be- ing, before  His  incarnation,  in  the  form  of  God,  did  not  regard Ills  divine  equality  as  a  prize  which  was  to  be  grasped  at  and retained  at  all  liazards,  but,  on  the  contrary,  laid  aside  the  form of  God,  and  took  upon  Himself  tho  nature  of  man.  The  em- phasis in  the  passage  is  upon  Christ's  humiliation.  The  fact of  His  equality  with  God  is  etated  as  a  background,  in  order to  throw  the  circumstances  of  His  incarnation  into  stronger  re- lief. Hence  the  peculiar  form  of  Paul's  statement.  Christ's great  object  was  to  identify  Himself  with  humanity ;  not  to appear  to  men  as  divine  but  as  Auman.  Had  He  come  into the  world  emphasizing  Uia  equality  with  God,  the  world  would have  been  amazed,  but  not  saved.  He  did  not  grasp  at  this. Tiie  rather  He  counted  hunifinity  His  prize,  and  so  laid  aside tho  conditions  of  Hia  preSxistent  state,  and  became  man.   .

The  toialdty  of His  beJDg  could  not  appear  to  men,  for  that  involved  the  form of  God.  Hence  the  apostle  views  JJim  solely  as  He  could  ap- pear to  men.  All  that  was  possible  was  a  real  and  complete likeness  to  humanity.  What  He  was  esaentiaZly  and  eternally could  not  eater  into  His  liumaD  mode  of  existence.  Humanly He  was  like  men,  but  regarded  with  reference  to  His  whole self,  He  was  not  identical  with  man,  becanee  there  was  an  ele- ment of  Hia  personality  which  did  not  dwell  in  them — equality with  God.  Hence  the  statement  of  His  human  manifestation ie  neceesarily  limited  by  tliis  fact,  and  ia  confined  to  likeness and  does  not  extend  to  identity.  \"To  affirm  likeness  is  at  once to  assert  similariiy  and  to  deny  S(mien6ss\"  (Dickson).  See  on Rom.  viii.  3.  8.  Being  found  in  fashion  as  a  man  (o^ij/iart  eipeSeU  tixt avSptawo^).  Some  expositors  connect  these  words  witli  tlie  pre- ceding clause,  thua:  beinff  made  in  the  likeness  of  men  and being  fouiid  in  fashion  as  a  man  /  a  new  sentence  beginning with  ITe  humbled  JTimself.  The  general  sense  ia  not  altered by  this  change,  and  there  is  great  force  in  Meyer's  remark  that the  preceding  thought,  in  the  likeness  qfm^n,  is  thus  \"  emphati- cally exhausted.\"  On  the  other  hand,  it  breaks  the  connection with  the  following  sentence,  which  thus  enters  vei-y  abruptly. Notice  beitiff found.  After  He  had  assumed  tl»e  conditions  of humanity,  and  men's  attention  was  drawn  to  Him,  they  found Him  like  a  man.

That  wliicii  is  purely  outward  and  ap- peals to  the  senses.  Thefnrm  of  a  servant  is  concerned  with the  fact  that  the  manifestation  aa  a  servant  corresponded with  the  real  fact  that  Christ  came  aa  the  servant  of  man- kind. In  the  phrase  in  the  likeness  of  men  the  thought  is  still linked  with  that  of  His  essential  nature  which  rendered  possible a  Itkeneaa  to  men,  but  not  an  absolute  identity  with  men.

He  sub- mitted not  only  to  deaths  but  to  the  death  of  a  malefactor. The  Mosaic  law  had  uttered  a  curse  against  it,  Deut  xxi.  23, and  the  Gentiles  reserved  it  for  malefactors  and  slaves.  Hence the  shams  associated  with  the  cross,  Heb.  xii.  2.  This  was  the offence  or  stumMi/ng-hlock  of  the  cross,  which  was  so  often  urged by  the  Jews  against  the  Christians.

Hence  the  salutation  is  not  at  the  name  of  Jesus, as  by  bowing  when  the  name  is  uttered,  but,  as  Ellicott  rightly says :  \"  the  spiritual  sphere,  the  holy  element  as  it  were,  in which  every  prayer  is  to  be  offered  and  every  knee  to  bow.\" Compare  Eph.  v.  20.

And any  rest  which  ministers  to  indifference  is  immoral  and  unreal — it  makes  parasites  and  not  men.  Just  because  God  worketh in  him,  as  the  evidence  and  triumph  of  it,  the  true  child  of God  works  out  his  own  salvation — works  it  out  having  really received  it — not  as  a  light  thing,  a  superfluous  labor,  but  witli fear  and  trembling  as  a  reasonable  and  indispensable  service  \" (Drummond,  \"  Natural  Law  in  the  Spiritual  World,\"  p.  335). Human  agency  is  included  in  God's  completed  work.  In  the saving  work  of  grace  God  imparts  a  new  moral  power  to  work. Compare  Kom.  vi.  8-13 ;  2  Cor.  vi.  1.

It  is  taking  heed  lest  we  fall;  it  is  a constant  apprehension  of  the  deceitf ulness  of  the  heart,  and  of the  insidiousness  and  power  of  inward  corruption.  It  is  the caution  and  circumspection  which  timidly  shrinks  from  what- ever would  offend  and  dishonor  God  and  the  Saviour.    And  ",

They  appeared  quite  early  in  the  his- tory of  the  Church,  and  are  those  referred  to  in  Acta  xv.  1. Paul  was  the  object  of  their  special  hatred  and  abuse.  Tliey challenged  his  birth,  his  authority,  and  his  motivea.  \"'Paul must  be  destroyed,'  was  aa  truly  their  watchword  as  the  cry  for the  destruction  of  Carthage  had  been  of  old  to  the  Itoinan senator\"  {Stanley,  \"Sermons  and  Lectures  on  tiie  Apostolic Age  \").  These  are  referred  to  in  ch.  i.  16 ;  and  the  whole  pas- sage in  the  present  cliapter,  from  ver.  3  to  ver.  11,  is  wortliy of  study,  being  full  of  incidental  hints  lurking  in  single  words, and  not  always  apparent  in  our  versions;  hints  which,  while they  illustrate  the  main  point  of  the  discussion,  are  also  aimed at  the  assertions  of  the  Jtidaizers.  Dogs  was  a  term  of  reproach among  both  Greeks  and  Jews.  Homer  uses  it  of  both  women and  men,  implying  shameleaeness  in  the  one,  and  i-ecklessness in  the  other.  Thus  Helen ;  \"  Brother-in-law  of  me,  a  mischief- devising  dog\"  (\"Diad,\"  vi.,  344).  Teuccr  of  Hector;  \"lean- not  hit  this  raging  dog\"  (\"Iliad,\"  viii.,  298).  Dr.  Thomson saysof  the  dogs  in  oriental  towns:  \"They  lie  about  the  streets in  such  numbers  as  to  render  it  difficult  and  often  dangerous  to pick  one's  way  over  and  amongst  them — a  lean,  hungry,  and sinister  brood.  They  have  no  owners,  but  upon  some  principle known  only  to  themselves,  they  combine  into  gangs,  each  of which  assumes  jurisdictioo  over  a  particnlar  street ;  and  they attack  with  the  utmost  ferocity  all  canine  intruders  into  their territory.  In  those  contests,  and  especially  during  the  night, they  keep  up  an  incessant  barking  and  howling,  such  as  is  rarely heard  in  any  Enropean  city.  The  imprecations  of  David  npon his  enemies  derive  their  significance,  therefore,  from  this  refer- ence to  one  of  the  most  odious  of  oriental  annoyances\"  (\"Land  ",

The  kindred  verb  occurs  in  the  Septuagint  only,  of  mutilations forbidden  by  the  Mosaic  law.  See  Lev.  xxi.  5.  The  noun here  is  a  play  upon  irepiTon^  ciroutncision.  It  means  vniilla- tion.  Paul  bitterly  characterizes  those  who  were  not  of  the  true circumcision  (Rom.  ii.  28,  29;  Col.  ii.  11;  Eph.  ii.  11)  as merely  tnutilated.  Compare  Gal.  v.  12,  where  he  uses  atroKoir- reivto  cut  off,  of  those  who  would  impose  circumcision  upon the  Christian  converts:  \"I  would  they  would  out  themselveif off  who  trouble  you ; \"  that  is,  not  merely  circumcise,  but mutilate  themseives  like  the  priests  of  Cybele.  3.  The  circumcision.  The  abstract  term  for  those  who  are circumcieed.  In  the  Old  Testament,  circumcision  was  a  meta- phor for  purity.

Circumcised  the  eighth  day  {TrepirofiQ  otcraii^epo^). Lit.,  eight  days  old  in  circumcision;  or  jxissing  the  eighth  day. For  the  idiom,  see  on  John  xi.  39,  and  compare  Acts  xxviii.  13. Converts  to  Judaism  were  circumcised  in  maturity:  Ishma- elites  in  their  thirteenth  year.  He  was  thus  shown  to  be  neither a  heathen  nor  an  Ishmaelite.  Of  the  stock  of  Israel.

The  form  of  the  name  appears  to  have  been both  Kolossai  and  KoUusaij  the  former  being  probably  the earlier.  The  city  was  in  Phrygia,  in  the  valley  of  the  Lyons,  abont  ten or  twelve  miles  beyond  Laodicaea  and  Hierapolis.  The  region is  volcanic,  and  the  earthquakes  common  to  large  portions  of Asia  Minor  are  here  peculiarly  severe.  The  tributaries  of  the Lycus  carried  calcareous  matter  which  formed  everywhere  de- posits of  travertine,  said  to  be  among  the  most  remarkable formations  of  this  character  in  the  world.  *^  Ancient  monu- ments are  buried,  fertile  lands  overlaid,  river-beds  choked  up, and  streams  diverted,  fantastic  grottos  and  cascades  and  arches of  stone  formed  by  this  strange,  capricions  power,  at  once  de- structive and  creative,  working  silently  and  relentlessly  through long  ages.  Fatal  to  vegetation,  these  incrustations  spread  like a  stony  shroud  over  the  ground.

The  fertility  of  the  region  was  nevertheless  great.  The  fine sheep,  and  the  chemical  qualities  of  the  streams  which  made the  waters  valuable  for  dyeing  purposes,  fostered  a  lively  trade in  dyed  woollen  goods.

It  is  tme  that  love  is  the  essence  of  the  Son as  of  the  Father ;  also,  that  the  Son's  mission  is  the  revelation of  the  Father's  love ;  bnt,  as  Meyer  correctly  says,  \"  the  lan- guage refers  to  the  exalted  Christ  who  rtdes.^  14.

That  from  which  the  world  was  redeemed, however,  was  not  sin,  in  tije  proper  sense  of  the  term,  but ijometbing  inherent  in  tbe  coostitution  of  the  world  itself,  and therefore  due  to  its  Creator.  In  tbe  following  passage  the  person  of  Christ  is  defined  as related  to  God  and  to  creation ;  and  absolute  supremacy  is claimed  for  Him.  See  Introduction  to  this  volume,  and  com- pare  Eph.  i.  20-23,  and  Thilip.  iL  6-11.  15.  The  image  {fUatv).  See  on  Apoc.  xiii.  14.

As  image  points  to revelation^  so  firstrbom  points  to  eternal  preexistence.  Even tbe  Rev.  is  a  little  ambiguous,  for  we  must  carefully  avoid  any suggestion  that  Christ  was  the  first  of  created  things,  vhich  is contradicted  by  tbe  following  words :  in  Ilim.  were  all  things created.  The  true  sense  is,  horn  \"before  the  creation.  Compare hefore  aU  things,  ver,  17.  This  fact  of  priority  implies  sover- eignty. He  is  exalted  above  all  thrones,  etc.,  and  all  things are  unto  (et?)  Him,  as  tbey  are  elsewhere  declared  to  be  unto God.     Compare  Ps.  Isxxix.  27 ;  Heb.  i.  2.  16.

In Tit.  iii.  1,  they  refer  to  earthly  dignities,  and  these  are  probably included  in  1  Cor.  xv.  24.  It  is  doubtful  whether  any  definite succession  of  rank  is  intended.  At  any  rate  it  is  impossible  to accurately  define  the  distinctions.  It  has  been  observed  that whevQYer  principalities  (apxaX)  and  powers  {i^ovaiai)  occur  to- gether, j?rmo^E>aZi^te«  always  precedes,  and  that  huvaiu^  power (see  Eph.  i.  21)  when  occurring  with  either  of  the  two,  follows it ;  or,  when  occurring  with  both,  follows  both.  The  primary reference  is,  no  doubt,  to  the  celestial  orders ;  but  the  expres- sions things  on  earthy  and  not  only  in  this  world  in  the  parallel passage,  Eph.  i.  21,  indicate  that  it  may  possibly  include  earthly dignities.  Principalities  and  powers  are  used  of  both  good and  evil  powers.  See  Eph.  iii.  10 ;  vi.  12 ;  Col.  ii.  15.  The passage  is  aimed  at  the  angel-worship  of  the  Colossians  (see  In- troduction) ;  showing  that  while  they  Iiave  been  discussing  the various  grades  of  angels  which  fill  the  space  between  God  and men,  and  depending  on  them  as  media  of  conmmnion  with God,  they  have  d^raded  Christ  who  is  above  them  all,  and  is   470  WORD  STUDIES  IN  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT.

The  subject  of  icaa  toeU  pUaaed^ God,  is  omitted  as  in  Jas.  i.  12,  and  must  be  supplied;  bo  that, literally,  the  passage  would  read,  God  was  toell pleased  that  fn   a  the  Toriation  of  Iba  S«p(u&gliit  trmn  tlie   Oh.

In  Christ  dwelt  all  the  fulness  of  God  as  deity.  The  relation of  essential  deity  to  creation  and  redemption  alike,  is  exhibited by  John  in  the  very  beginning  of  his  gospel,  with  which  this passage  should  be  compared.  In  John  the  order  is:  1.  The essential  nature  of  Christ ;  2.  Creation ;  3.  Redemption.  Here it  is :  1.  Redemption  (ver.  13) ;  2.  Essential  being  of  the  Son (16) ;  3.  The  Son  as  Creator  (16) ;  4.  The  Church,  with  Christ as  its  head  (18).  Compare  2  Cor.  v.  19 ;  Eph.  i.  19,  20,  23. Paul  does  not  add  of  the  Godhead  to  ihefulneeSj  as  in  ch.  ii.  9, since  the  word  occurs  in  direct  connection  with  those  which  de- scribe Christ's  essential  nature,  and  it  would  seem  not  to  have occurred  to  the  apostle  that  it  could  be  understood  in  any  other sense  than  as  an  expression  of  the  plenitude  of  the  divine  at- tributes and  powers.  Thus  the  phrase  m  Him  ehovld  all  thefvlneee  dwell  gathers into  a  grand  climax  the  previous  statements — image  of  Qodj Jirat'hom  of  all  oreatiorij  Creator ^  the  eternally  jpreeoBistentj  the Head  of  the  Churchy  the  victor  over  deaths  fi/rst  in  all  things. On  this  summit  we  pause,  looking,  like  John,  from  Christ  in His  fulness  of  deity  to  the  exhibition  of  that  divine  fulness  in redemption  consummated  in  heaven  (vv.  20-22).  There  must  also  be  taken  into  the  account  the  selection  of this  word  fulness  with  reference  to  the  false  teaching  in  the Colossian  church,  the  errors  which  afterward  were  developed more  distinctly  in  the  Gnostic  schools.  Pleroma  fulness  was used  by  the  Gnostic  teachers  in  a  technical  sense,  to  express  the sum-total  of  the  divine  powers  and  attributes.  ^^From  the pleroTiia  they  supposed  that  all  those  agencies  issued  through which  God  has  at  any  time  exerted  His  power  in  creation,  or manifested  His  will  through  revelation.      These  mediatorial  *  The  explanation  which  makes  all  thf,  fulne$8  the  snbjeci,  aU  thefidness wu  plecued  to  dioell  in  Him  (so  EUioott)  is  against  New-Testament  UHSge.   i'ii  WORD   STUDEES   IN  THE  NEW  TESTAMBITr.

They  were  only  partial  and  blurred  images,  often deceptive  caricatures,  of  their  original,  broken  lights  of  the great  Central  Light \"  (Lightfoot).  Christ  may  have  been ranked  with  ihese  inferior  images  of  the  divine  by  the  CoIob- sian  teacliers.

Thus  Gen.  xxxvii.  1, \"  Jacob  dwelt  (permanently,  Kar^Ku)  in  the  land  where  his father  sojourned  (-rapioKqaai,  A.  V.,  wat  a  stranger).  Perhaps in  contrast  with  the  partial  and  transient  connection  of  the pleroma  with  Christ  asserted  by  the  false  teachers.  The  word is  used  of  the  indwelling  of  the  Father,  Eph.  ii.  22  {xorotieijTij- pu>v  Tov  ©eoO  habitation  of  God) ;  of  the  Son,  Eph.  iii.  17 ;  and of  the  Spirit,  Jas.  iv.  5,  20.

Only  here,  ver.  21,  and Eph.  ii.  16.  The  connection  is:  it  was  the  goodpleasure  of  the Father  (ver.  19)  to  reconcile.  The  compounded  preposition  airo gives  the  force  of  hack,  hinting  at  restoration  to  a  primal  unity.

Cf  the  afflictions  of Christ  The  afflictions  which  Christ  endured;  which  be- longed to  Him:  not  PavJ^s  afflictions  described  as  Christ's because  endured  in  fellowship  with  Him  (Meyer);  nor  the afflictions  which  Christ  endures  in  His  Church  (Alford,  Elli- cott,  Eadie).  These  afflictions  do  not  include  ChrisCs  vicarioi^  svfferings^ which  are  never  denoted  by  ^X/^i9  trihtUations.  That  which is  lacking  of  the  afflictions  of  Christ  signifies  that  portion  of Christ's  ministerial  sufferings  which  was  not  endured  by  Him in  person,  but  is  endured  in  the  suffering  of  Christians  in  all generations  in  carrying  out  Christ's  work.  Compare  2  Cor.  L 5,  7 ;  Philip,  iii.  10.  Hence  those  are  mistaken  interpretations which  explain  the  filling  up  as  a  correspondence  of  the  supply with  the  deficiency.  The  correspondence  is  between  the  two parties,  Christ  and  His  followers,  and  the  supply  does  not  cor- respond with  the  deficiency,  but  works  toward  supplying  it. The  point  is  not  the  identification  of  Paul  with  Christ  in  His sufferings  (which  is  true  as  a  fact),  but  the  distinction  between Paul  and  Christ.  Hence  the  present  tense,  /  am  filling  up^ denoting  something  still  in  progress.

Before the  beginning  of  the  ages  of  the  world  the  counsel  of  God  was ordained^  but  not  concealed^  because  there  were  no  human beings  from  whom  to  conceal  it.

The  mystery  of  the  admission  of  the  Gentiles  to  the  gospel  cove- nant, now  revealed  through  Paul's  preaching,  was  divinely  rich and  glorious.  This  glory  is  the  manifestation  of  the  kingdom of  Christ  among  the  Gentiles  as  their  inheritance  (ver.  12 ; compare  Rom.  viii.  18,  21 ;  2  Cor.  iv.  17).  The  richness  ex- hibited itself  in  the  free  dispensation  of  the  Gospel  to  the  Gen- tile as  well  as  to  the  Jew.  It  was  not  limited  by  national  lines. Compare  '^  the  same  Lord  is  rich  unto  all,\"  Rom.  x.  12 ;  and beggarly  elementSj  Gal.  iv.  9.  Which  is  Christ  in  you.  The  readings  differ.  Some read  09,  masculine,  whichy  referring  to  the  riches:  others  t, neuter,  whichy  referring  to  mystery.  The  latter  corresponds witli  ch.  ii.  2,  the  mystery  of  God^  Christy  etc.  In  either  ease the  defining  words  are  Christ  in  you,  i.e.,  in  the  Oentiles; either  as  constituting  the  richness  of  glory  in  this  mystery,  or as  being  the  essence  of  the  mystery  itself.

The  full  glory  of  the  inheritance  was  a hope,  to  be  realized  when  Christ  eliould  appear  \"  the  eecond time  unto  salvation \"  (lleb.  ix.  28).  Compare  1  Tim.  i.  1. Glory  refers  to  the  glory  of  the  mystery  ;  hence  the  glory,  but with  more  emphasis  upon  the  idea  of  the  same  glory  conanm- mated  at  Christ's  coming — the  glory  which  shall  be  revealed.

The true  Oospel  also  has  its  mysteries,  its  hierophants,  its  initiation ; but  these  are  open  to  all  alike.  In  Christ  every  believer  is riXeio^;  fully  initiated,  for  he  has  been  admitted  as  iviimf^ eye-witness  of  its  most  profound,  most  awful  secrets.\"  29.  I  labor  {lamiA).  Unto  weariness.  See  on  Luke  v.  5. The  connection  with  the  following  ofymvi^o/iepo^  contending  in the  arena,  seems  to  show  that  I  labor  has  the  special  sense  of labor  vn  preparing  for  the  contest.

So  Clement  of  Rome: '^  Who  have  labored  {icoiridaavTes;)  much,  and  contended  (ayenn- adfievoi)  honorably  \"  (iL  7).     See  on  1  Cor.  ix.  24-27.  Striving  {ofye^Pi^ofAeposi).  From  arytov,  originally  an  assembly, a  place  of  assembly,  especially  for  viewing  the  games.  Hence the  contest  itself,  the  word  being  united  with  different  adjectives indicating  the  character  of  the  contest,  as  imrum  of  horses ; yv/jLviK6^  gymnastic  /  funnrum  of  nhusic ;  yfSkjceo^t  where  the prize  is  a  brazen  shield,  etc.  Generally,  any  struggle  or  trial. Hence  the  verb  means  to  enter  a  contest,  to  contend,  to  struggle. Tlie  metaphor  is  a  favorite  one  with  Paul,  and,  with  the  excep- tion of  three  instances  (Luke  xiii.  24 ;  John  xviii.  36 ;  Heb. xii.  1),  the  words  ary<ov  contest  and  arytovi^ofuu  to  contend  are found  only  in  his  writings.

Colossae was  ten  or  twelve  miles  farther  up  the  stream.  Hierapolis  owed its  celebrity  to  its  warm  mineral  springs,  its  baths,  and  its  trade in  dyed  wools.  It  was  a  centre  of  the  worship  of  the  Phrygian goddess  Cybele,*  whose  rites  were  administered  by  mutilated priests  known  as  Galli,  and  of  other  rites  representing  different oriental  cults.     Hence  the  name  Hierapolis  or  sobered  city.  *  The  Phrygiftn  mother  of  the  gods,  known  elsewhere  as  Bhea.

A  similar  omission  of  the  official  title occurs  in  the  Epistles  to  the  Thessalonians  and  Philippians, and  is  accounted  for  on  the  similar  ground  of  his  afFectionate relations  with  the  Macedonian  churches.

He  was  one  of Paul's  converts  (ver.  19),  and  his  labors  in  the  Gospel  at  Colos- sae are  attested  by  the  t\\t\\e  fellow-laborer^  and  illustrated  by his  placing  his  house  at  the  disposal  of  the  Colossian  Christians lor  their  meetings  (ver.  2).  The  statements  that  he  subse- quently became  bishop  of  Colossae  and  suffered  martyrdom  are legendary.   516  WORD  STUDIES  IN  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT  2.

Onesimos  was  a  runaway  Phrygian  slave,  who  had  com- mitted some  crime  and  therefore  had  fled  from  his  master  and hidden  himself  in  Bome.  Under  Koman  law  the  slave  was  a chattel.  Yarro  classified  slaves  among  imptementSy  which  he classifies  as  vocaliay  artiotdate  speaking  implements,  as  slaves  / semwocaliaj  having  a  voice  but  not  articiUatingj  as  oxen  /  tnutaj dumhj  as  wagons.  The  attitude  of  the  law  toward  the  slave  was expressed  in  the  formula  servile  cajmt  nvJlumjus  hdbeA;  the slave  has  no  right.  The  master's  power  was  unlimited.  He might  mutilate,  torture,  or  kill  the  slave  at  his  pleasure.  PoUio, in  the  time  of  Augustus,  ordered  a  slave  to  be  thrown  into  a pond  of  voracious  lampreys.  Augustus  interfered,  but  after- ward ordered  a  slave  of  his  own  to  be  crucified  on  the  mast  of  a ship  for  eating  a  favorite  quail.  Juvenal  describes  a  profligate woman  ordering  a  slave  to  be  crucified.  Some  one  remonstrates. She  replies :  ^'  So  then  a  slave  is  a  man,  is  he  I  ^  He  has  done nothing,'  yon  say.  Granted.  I  command  it.  Let  my  pleasure stand  for  a  reason  \"  (vi.,  219).  Martial  i^ecords  an  instance  of  a master  cutting  out  a  slave's  tongue.  The  old  Roman  legislation imposed  death  for  killing  a  plough-ox ;  but  the  murderer  of  a slave  was  not  called  to  account.  Tracking  fugitive  slaves  was a  trade.  Recovered  slaves  were  branded  on  the  forehead,  con- demned to  double  labor,  and  sometimes  thrown  to  the  beasts  in the  amphitheatre.  The  slave  population  was  enormous.

The  word  is  also  used  of  grant- ing for  deatructioii,  Acts  xxv.  11;  or  tor  jfreeervation.  Acts iii.  14,  23.  Epaphras  my  fellow-prisoner  (Ewa^pw  6  wvcuyjiaK- a>To;  iK>v).  Epaphras  is  mentioned  Col.  i.  7;  iv.  12.  Some identify  him  with  Epaphroditns,  but  without  sufficient  reason. Epaphroditns  appears  to  have  been  a  nativeof  Philippi  (Philip, ii.  25),  and  Epaphras  of  Colossae  {Col.  iv.  12).  Epaphroditns is  always  used  of  the  Philippian,  and  Epaphras  of  the  Coloe- sian.  The  names,  however,  are  the  same,  Epaphras  being  a contraction.  It  is  disputed  whether  feUow-prUoner  is  to  be  taken  in  a  lit- eral or  in  a  spiritual  sense.  For  the  latter  see  Horn.  vii.  23; 2  Oor.  X.  5  ;  Eph.  iv,  8.  Compare  feUoio-goldisr,  ver.  2,  and Philip,  ii,  25,  In  liom.  xvi.  7.  the  word  used  here  is  applied to  Andronicua  and  Juin'a,  Paul  was  not  strictly  an  ai^^Xaitoc prisoner  of  war  (see  on  Luke  iv,  18).  The  probabilities  seem to  favor  the  spiritual  sense,  Liglitfoot  suggests  that  Epaphras' relations  with  Paul  at  Rome  may  have  excited  euspicion  and ted  to  his  temporary  continement ;  or  that  he  may  voluntarily have  shared  Paul's  imprisonment.   THB  EPISTLE  TO  PHILEMON.  525  24.  Mark.  Probably  John  Mark  the  evangelist.  He  appears as  the  companion  of  Paal,  Acts  xii.  25 ;  Col.  iv.  10 ;  2  Tim. iv.  11.  Aristarchus.

See  Col.  iv.  14 ;  2  Tim.  iv.  10.  Luke.  The  physician  and  evangelist  See  Introdnction  to Luke's  Gospel.  25.  Grace — with  your  spirit.  As  in  Gal.  vL  18,  with  the omission  here  of  brother.    See  on  2  Cor.  xiii.  14.  Out  of  many  private  letters  which  must  have  been  written  by Paul,  this  alone  has  been  preserved.  Its  place  in  the  New  Test- ament canon  is  vindicated,  so  far  as  its  internal  character  is  con- cerned, by  its  picture  of  Paul  as  a  christian  gentleman,  and  by its  exhibition  of  Paul's  method  of  dealing  with  a  great  social evil.  Paul's  dealing  with  the  institution  of  slavery  displayed  the profouudest  christian  sagacity.  To  have  attacked  the  institu- tion as  such  would  have  been  worse  than  useless.  To  one  who reads  between  the  lines,  Paul's  silence  means  more  than  any amount  of  denunciation ;  for  with  his  silence  goes  his  faith  in the  power  of  christian  sentiment  to  settle  Anally  the  whole  ques- tion. He  knows  that  to  bring  slavery  into  contact  with  living Christianity  is  to  kill  slavery.  He  accepts  the  social  condition as  a  fact,  and  even  as  a  law.  He  sends  Onesimus  back  to  his legal  owner.  He  does  not  bid  Philemon  emancipate  him,  but he  puts  the  christian  slave  on  his  true  footing  of  a  christian brother  beside  his  master.  As  to  the  institution,  he  knows  that the  recognition  of  the  slave  as  free  in  Christ  will  carry  with  it, ultimately,  the  recognition  of  his  civil  freedom.  History  vindicated  him  in  the  Roman  empire  itself.  Under Constantine  the  effects  of  christian  sentiment  began  to  appear in  the  Church  and  in  legislation  concerning  slaves.  Official freeing  of  slaves  became  common  as  an  act  of  pious  gratitude, and  burial  tablets  often  represent  masters  standing  before  the   526  WORD   STUDIES  IN  THE  NEW   TESTAMENT.  Good  Shepherd,  with  a  band  of  slaves  liberated  at  death,  and pleading  for  theiu  at  judgment.  Id  a.d.  312  a  law  was  passed declariog  as  homicide  the  poisoning  or  branding  of  slaves,  and giving  them  to  be  torn  hy  beaeta.  The  advance  of  a  healthier eentiment  may  be  seen  by  compariug  the  law  of  Angnetiis, which  forbade  a  master  to  emancipate  more  than  one-fifth  of hifi  slaves,  and  which  fixed  one  hundred  males  as  a  maximum for  one  time^ — ^and  the  unlimited  permission  to  emancipate  con- ceded by  Constantino.  Each  new  rnler  enacted  eome  measure which  facilitated  emancipation.  Every  obstacle  was  thrown  by the  law  in  the  way  of  separating  families.  Under  Justinian  all presumptions  were  in  favor  of  liberty.  If  a  slave  had  several owners,  one  conld  emancipate  him,  and  the  others  must  accept compensation  at  a  reduced  valuation.  The  mutilated,  and those  who  had  served  in  the  army  with  their  masters'  knowl- edge and  consent,  were  liberated.  All  the  old  laws  which  lim- ited the  age  at  which  a  slave  could  be  freed,  and  the  number which  could  be  emancipated,  were  aUolislied.  A  master's  mar- riage with  a  slave  freed  all  the  children.  Sick  and  uselesa slaves  must  be  sent  by  their  masters  to  the  hospital.  Great  and  deserved  praise  has  been  bestowed  on  this  letter. Bengel  says :  \"  A  familiar  and  exceedingly  courteous  epistle concerning  a  private  afFair  is  inserted  among  the  New  Testa- ment books,  intended  to  affoi-d  a  specimen  of  the  highest  wis- dom as  to  how  Christians  should  arrange  civil  affairs  on  loftier principles.\"  Franke,  quoted  by  Bengel,  says :  \"  The  single epistle  to  Philemon  very  far  surpasses  all  the  wisdom  of  the world.\"  Renan  :  \"  A  true  little  cJief-^Voeuvre  of  the  art  of  let- ter-writing.\"  Sabatier  :  \"  This  short  epistle  gleams  like  a  pearl of  the  most  exquisite  purity  in  the  rich  treasure  of  the  Kew Testament.\"  *  *  other  testimanieB  maybe  found  collected  hj  Ligbtfoot,  \"CotaiamUiy on  Plillemoo,\"  iDtroduclion,  and  Farror,  \"  PauV'  ii.,  ohs.  1.,  11.  flee  alao Dr.  Httokett's  artiolB  on  Hie  epiBtle  in  Smith'*  \"Dictionary  at  the  Bible.\"  Th» letter  of  Pliny  the  Toonger  to  SabinianuB,  vhich  Is  oflen  compared  with PaDl'a,  Is  given  In  full  hy  Farm,  vol.  11.,  excanni  v.

It  has  survived  long  enough  for  the  copyright  to  expire  and  the  book  to  enter  the  public  domain.  A  public  domain  book  is  one  that  was  never  subject to  copyright  or  whose  legal  copyright  term  has  expired.  Whether  a  book  is  in  the  public  domain  may  vary  country  to  country.  Public  domain  books are  our  gateways  to  the  past,  representing  a  wealth  of  history,  culture  and  knowledge  that's  often  difficult  to  discover.

Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   WEITINGS  OF  JOHN.   INTRODUCTION.   The  life  of  John  covers  a  period  from  near  the  beginning  of the  first  century  to  the  beginning  of  the  second.  He  was  a native  of  Galilee,  and,  according  to  tradition,  of  the  town  of Bethsaida,  which  was  on  the  western  shore  of  the  Lake,  not far  from  Capernaum  and  Chorazin.  His  father  was  Zebedee. His  mother,  Salome  (Mark  xvi.  1 ;  Matt.  xx.  20),  was  among the  women  who  supported  the  Lord  with  their  substance  (Luke viii.  3),  and  attended  Him  to  His  crucifixion  (Mark  xv.  40). The  family  was  not  without  worldly  means.  Zebedee  was  a fisherman,  and  had  hired  servants  in  his  employ  (Mark  i.  20). Salome  ministered  to  Jesus,  and  John  seems  to  have  had  his own  house  (John  xix.  27).  He  was,  apparently,  one  of  the  dis- ciples of  John  the  Baptist ;  and  while  engaged  in  his  father's craft,  was  found  and  called  by  Jesus  (Matt.  iv.  21 ;  Mark  i.  19). Of  the  two  mentioned  in  John  i.  35,  only  one,  Andrew,  is named  (John  i.  40)  ;  the  other  is  commonly  supposed  to  have been  John,  who  suppresses  his  own  name,  as  in  other  instances where  he  refers  to  himself  (John  xiv.  23 ;  xviii.  15 ;  xix.  26  ; XX.  3,  4,  8 ;  xxi.  20).*  As  soon  as  Jesus  was  made  known  to  him,  he  became  His enthusiastic  disciple.     His  peculiar  intimacy  with  our  Lord  is  *  That  he  names  himself  in  the  Apocalypse,  and  not  in  the  Gospel,  is  suffi- ciently explained  by  the  fact  that  the  Gospel  is  historical,  intended  to  bring Christ  into  prominence  and  to  keep  the  writer  ont  of  view.  The  Apocalypse, on  the  other  hand,  is  prophetic,  and  the  name  of  the  author  is  required  aa  a Toooher  for  the  lerelationB  granted  him.    Compare  Dan.  yii.  16 ;  YiiL  27.

He  was  admitted to  the  death-chamber  of  the  ruler's  daughter  (Mark  v.  37)  and witnessed  her  restoration  to  life  ;  he  was  present  at  the  Trans- figui-ation  (Luke  ix.  28),  and  with  Peter  and  James  was  chosen by  the  Master  to  bear  Him  company  during  His  agony  in  Geth- semane  (Mark  xiv.  33).  He  accompanied  Jesus,  after  His  ar- rest, into  the  palace  of  the  High  Priest,  and  secured  entrance for  Peter  (John  xviii.  15,  16).  He  stood  by  the  cross  with  the mother  of  Jesus,  and  to  his  care  Jesus  committed  her  (John xix.  25-27).  With  Peter  he  ran  to  the  sepulchre  on  the  morn- ing of  the  Resurrection  at  the  summons  of  Mary  Magdalene, entered  the  empty  tomb,  and  saw  and  believed  (John  xx.  2-8). After  the  Resurrection  he  appears  engaged  in  his  former  em- ployment on  the  Lake  of  Galilee.  He  is  the  first  to  recognize the  risen  Lord  standing  upon  the  shore  (John  xxi.  7),  and  is the  subject  of  Peter's  inquiry,  \"  Lord,  what  shall  this  man do  ? \"  when  he  is  seen  by  Peter  to  be  following  Jesus  (John xxi.  20).  His  apostolic  activity  was  in  the  first  thirty  years  after  the Ascension.  In  Jerusalem  his  position  among  the  apostles  was not  exceptionally  prominent.  At  the  time  of  the  Stephanie  per- secution he  remained  with  the  other  apostles  at  Jerusalem  (Acts viii.  1) ;  but  when  Paul,  three  years  after  his  conversion,  came to  that  city  (Gal.  1.  18),  he  met  there  only  Peter,  and  James the  Lord's  brother.  From  this,  however,  it  does  not  follow that  the  remaining  apostles  had  permanently  departed  from Jerusalem  and  settled  elsewhere.  In  Gal.  ii.  9,  Paul  alludes  to John  as  having  been  present  in  Jerusalem  at  the  time  of  the council  (Acts  xv.).  The  narrative  in  Acts  does  not  mention  him in  connection  with  the  council,  but  Paul,  in  the  Galatian  letter, refers  to  him  as  one  of  the  pillars  of  the  church  with  James and  Cephas.  The  commonly  received  tradition  represents  him  as  closing his  apostolic  career  in  Asia  and  at  Ephesus.  An  old  tradition aflBrms  that  he  left  Jerusalem  twelve  years  after  the  death  of Christ.     In  no  case,  therefore,  did  he  go  immediately  to  Ephe-   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   DrrRODUcnoN.  3  sus.  Definite  notices  as  to  his  abode  in  the  interval  are wholly  wanting.  It  is  a  noteworthy  fact  that  the  lives  of  so many  of  the  world's  leaders  include  spaces  which  remain  a blank  to  the  most  careful  biographer,  and  into  which  the world's  curiosity  can  never  penetrate.  Snch  is  the  period  of Paul's  retirement  in  Arabia,  of  Dante's  exile,  and,  to  some  ex- tent, of  Jesus'  temptation  in  the  wilderness.  Some  later  tra- ditions assert  that  he  visited  Parthia,  and  Jerome  groundlessly conjectures  that  he  had  preached  in  Judsea.  There  is  some plausibility  in  the  supposition  that  he  may  have  betaken  him- self to  Antipch  at  the  time  of  Paul's  first  missionary  journey. It  is  certain  that,  much  later,  John  was  a  successor  of  Paul  at Ephesus.  Neither  at  the  departure  of  Paul  to  Miletus  (Acts XX.)  nor  during  the  composition  of  the  Ephesian  letter  is  there a  trace  of  John's  presence  at  Ephesus.  Tradition  is  also  agreed  that  John  was  banished  to  the  isle of  Patmos  by  the  Roman  authority.  Irenseus  says  that  he was  banished  in  the  reign  of  Domitian :  another  tradition  as- signs the  exile  to  the  reign  of  Nero.  From  this  exile  he  was permitted  to  return,  it  is  said,  under  Nerva  (a.d.  96-98).  The date  of  his  death  is  unknown.  Jerome  places  it  sixty-eight years  after  the  death  of  Christ  The  dominant  characteristic  of  John's  nature  is  contempla- tive receptivity.  Every  word  of  his  Lord  is  taken  into  his deepest  heart,  held  fast  and  pondered.  '*He  does  not  ask, *  What  shall  I  do  ? '  but '  What  does  He  do  ? ' \"  Hence  it  is clear  why  the  finest  and  subtilest  flavor  of  Jesus'  personality has  been  caught  by  him.  With  this  receptiveness  goes  a  power of  impartation.  \"  Every  man,\"  says  Ebrard,  \"  can  see  the  sun- set-glow on  an  Alp,  but  not  every  one  can  paint  it.\"  John, like  a  mirror,  not  only  received  but  reflected.  While  the  other Evangelists  perceived  that  element  of  Jesus'  teaching  and  work which  produced  the  most  immediate  and  striking  outward  re- sults, as  the  Sermon  on  the  Mount,  for  instance,  John  discerned the  meaning  and  the  bearing  of  less  prominent  incidents,  such as  the  conversation  at  Jacob's  well.  Paul,  like  John,  has  the quality  of  inwardness,  but  Paul  reasons  where  John  contem- plates.   John  is  tenacious  and  intense ;  Paul  equally  so,  but   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   4  INTRODUOnON.  more  deft  than  John.  John  broods  over  his  thought;  Paul thrusts  and  parries  with  it.  Yet  John  is  no  sentimentalist.  He  is  not  the  lovely,  effem- inate youth  of  picture.  His  mental  and  moral  fibre  is  strong. He  received  the  title  \"  Son  of  Thunder  \"  from  One  who  never misread  character.  Kot  irascible,  as  some  have  too  hastily  in- ferred from  Luke  ix.  54,  he  illustrates  the  peculiarity  of  many affectionate  and  contemplative  natures,  which  flash  into  a  start- ling impetuosity  on  occasions  which  appeal  to  their  more  radi- cal view  of  truth  and  to  their  longer  range  of  vision.  John was  incapable  of  half -enthusiasms  and  of  suspended  faith.  To whatever  he  addressed  himself,  he  was  totvs  in  illis.  In  his own  way,  he  is  no  less  plain-spoken  and  severe  than  Paul.  He is  direct  where  Paul  is  sometimes  ironical.  He  is  neither gentle  nor  vague  in  his  language  concerning  those  who  deny that  Jesus  is  the  Christ  (1  John  ii.  22),  nor  concerning  the lineage  of  him  that  committeth  sin  (1  John  iii.  8)  and  the  moral quality  of  him  that  hateth  his  brother  (1  John  iii.  15  ;  iv.  20). In  the  Apocalypse  he  enters  with  profoundest  sympathy  into the  divine  indignation  against  evil,  and  contemplates  with  un- feigned joy  its  wholesale  and  crushing  defeat  and  punishment. He  seems  to  cheer  the  progress  of  the  Conqueror  upon  the white  horse.  The  issues  between  truth  and  falsehood,  life  and death,  light  and  darkness,  love  and  hatred  are  stated  by  him with  a  stem  and  decisive  sharpness,  and  as  absolute  finalities. The  quality  of  sin  is  conceived  according  to  the  scale  of  his adoring  love  for  Christ.  He  deals  with  it  as  wickedness  rather than  as  weakness,  though  not  overlooking  the  latter.  For  him the  victory  of  the  Gospel  is  not  a  prophecy,  but  an  accom- plished fact.  Faith  ove7*cometh  the  world.  The  overcoming Christ  is  already  present  in  every  believer.  Such  a  character  would  not  have  been  adapted  to  Paul's work.  It  was  not  suflSciently  versatile  and  many-sided.  John had  not  Paul's  pioneer  instinct,  his  pushing  activity,  and  his executive  power.  He  was  fitted  to  raise  the  superstructure rather  than  to  lay  foundations ;  to  be  a  teacher  rather  than  an evangelist.  It  was  his  to  complete  the  teaching  of  the  other apostles  by  unfolding  the  speculative  mystery  of  the  incama-   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   INTRODUCTION.  6  tioQ  and  the  secret  of  the  inward  union  of  the  believer  with Christ ;  to  purge  the  Church  from  speculative  error,  and  to hold  up,  over  against  the  Gnostic  caricature,  the  true  image  of the  Son  of  Man.  The  writings  ascribed  to  John  ai*e  the  Grospel,  three  Epis- tles, and  the  Apocalypse  or  Bevelation.  THE  GOSPEL.  The  nearly  unanimous  tradition  of  the  Church  assigns  the fourth  Gospel  to  John.  It  is  unquestionably  the  work  of  a Jew,  an  eye-witness,  and  a  disciple  of  Jesus.  It  was  probably written  towai*d  the  dose  of  the  first  century,  and  thei*ef  ore  later than  the  other  three  Grospels.  According  to  the  earliest  evi- dence, it  was  composed  at  Ephesus,  at  the  request  of  John's intimate  friends,  who  desired  to  have  his  oral  teaching  recorded for  the  permanent  use  of  the  Church.  Thei*e  are  three  theories  as  to  the  motive  of  its  composition. Accoi*ding  to  the  first,  known  as  the  *^  supplementary  \"  theory, John  wrote  the  fourth  Gospel  as  a  supplement  to  its  predeces- sors, in  order  to  supply  what  was  wanting  in  the  synoptic narrative.  This  Gospel  is  indeed  supplementary  in  fact,  but not  in  motive.  It  is  supplementary  in  that  the  writer  con- stantly assumes  that  certain  facts  are  already  known  to  his readers,  and  adds  other  facts  from  his  own  special  information. But  the  Grospel  itself  expressly  disclaims  ^1  intention  to  be complete  (xxi.  25),  and  is  an  original  conception,  both  in  form and  substance,  having  a  distinct  plan  of  its  own,  and  present- ing a  fresh  aspect  of  tlie  person  and  teaching  of  our  Lord.  ^'  It is  the  picture  of  one  who  paints,  not  because  others  have  failed to  catch  the  ideal  he  would  represent,  but  because  his  heart  is full  and  he  must  speak.''  The  second  theory  is  that  the  Gk>spel  is  ^^ polemical\"  or controversial,  designed  to  oppose  the  errors  of  the  Nicolaitanes and  of  Cerinthus.  But  the  Gospel  is  polemical  only  incident- ally, as  the  presentation  of  the  positive  truth  suggests  particu- lar points  of  error.  The  point  of  view  is  not  controversial. The  writer  is  moved  by  the  pressure  of  his  great  theme  to  set   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   6  INTRODUCTION.  it  forth  in  its  positive  aspects,  and  not  with  special  reference  to the  errors  of  his  time.  The  third  theory,  known  as  tlie  \"irenic\"  or  conciliatory, maintains  that  the  Gospel  was  intended  to  reconcile  divergent religious  views,  and  to  bring  into  their  right  relation  truths which  heresy  perverted.  The  Gospel  is  conciliatory  in  fact, not  from  detiuite  intent,  but  from  the  very  nature  of  the  sub- ject— the  Word  made  flesh,  in  which  all  religious  controversies are  reconciled.  \"Just  as  it  rises  above  controversy  while  it condemns  error,  it  preserves  the  characteristic  truths  which heresy  isolated  and  misused.  The  fourth  Gospel  is  the  most complete  answer  to  the  manifold  forms  of  Gnosticism,  yet  it was  the  writing  most  used  by  the  Gnostics.  It  contains  no  for- mal narrative  of  the  institution  of  sacraments,  and  yet  it  pre- sents most  fully  the  idea  of  sacraments.  It  sets  forth  with  the strongest  emphasis  the  failure  of  the  ancient  people,  and  yet  it points  out  most  clearly  the  significance  of  the  dispensation which  was  committed  to  them.  It  brings  the  many  oppositions — antitheses — of  life  and  thought,  and  leaves  them  in  the  light of  the  one  supreme  fact  which  reconciles  all,  the  Word  became flesh  ;  and  we  feel  from  first  to  last  that  this  light  is  shining over  the  record  of  sorrow  and  triumph,  of  defeat  and  hope  \" (Westcott).  The  object  is  distinctly  stated  in  the  Gospel  itself.  \"  These are  written  that  ye  may  believe  that  Jesus  is  the  Christ,  the Son  of  God,  and  that,  believing,  ye  may  have  life  in  His name\"  (xxi.  30,  31).  The  last  of  these  three — life  in  Christ through  faith— is  the  key  to  the  two  others.  The  i-eaders  were already  disciples;  and  in  vindicating  the  two  propositions  that Jesus  is  the  Christ  and  that  Jesus  is  the  Son  of  God,  the  ob- ject was  not  to  lead  to  the  acknowledgment  of  His  divine  mis- sion, but  to  exhibit  these  as  the  ground  of  a  living  communion of  believers  with  God,  and  of  a  richer  spiritual  life.  The  char- acter of  the  Grospel  is  predominantly  historic.  Even  the  doc- trinal portions  have  a  historic  background  and  a  historic  em- bodiment. The  doctrine,  for  instance,  of  the  essential  antago- nism between  light  and  darkness,  it  s^t  forth  in  the  narrative of  the  hostile  attitude  of  the  Jews  toward  Christ ;  and  the  dis-   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   INTBODUCTION.  7  CQSsions  with  tliein  have  their  root  and  material  in  this  same antagonism.  The  historical  material  is  carefulij  selected  with a  view  to  its  bearing  on  the  particular  conception  of  Christ's person  and  work  which  is  announced  in  the  Prologue.  The history  is  the  practical  exhibition  of  the  Logos-doctrine  in  the person  and  earthly  life  of  the  Man  Jesus.  The  miracles  are invariably  termed  siffnSy  and  are  regarded  as  expressions  and evidences  of  the  divine  personality  of  the  worker.  The  Gospel  is  characterized  by  the  profuse  employment  of symbolism.  This  accords  with  its  Hebrew  fibre,  and  also, lai^ly,  with  the  nature  of  its  subject.  For  not  only  was  John a  Jew,  familiar  with  the  symbolic  economy  and  prophecy  of the  Old  Testament,  but  Jesus,  the  central  figure  of  his  Gospel was,  pre-eminently  the  f  ulfiUer  of  the  Law  and  of  the  Prophe- cies. Christ's  own  teaching,  too,  was  largely  symbolic ;  and John's  peculiar,  profound  spiritual  insight  detected  in  His  or- dinary acts  that  larger  meaning  which  belonged  to  them  in  vir- tue of  Jesus'  position  as  the  representative  of  humanity ;  and that  unity  of  the  natural  and  spiritual  worlds  which  was  as- sumed in  the  utterances  of  our  Loi*d  in  which  tlie  visible  was used  as  the  type  of  the  invisible.  \"John,\"  says  Lange,  \"gives ns  not  only  a  symbolism  of  the  Old  Testament  word,  of  Old Testament  institutions,  histories,  and  persons ;  he  gives  also  the symbolism  of  nature,  of  antiquity,  of  history  and  of  personal life ;  hence  the  absolute  symbolism,  or  the  ideal  import  of  all real  existence,  in  significant  outlines.\"  The  relation  of  the  Gh>spel  to  the  Old  Testament  is  pro- nounced. The  centre  of  the  Old  Testament  system  is  the  man- ifestation of  the  glory  of  God — the  Shekinah.  John  declares that  this  glory  appears  essentially  in  Christ.  He  recognizes  the divine  preparation  among  the  nations  for  Christ's  coming, and  the  special  discipline  of  Israel  with  a  view  to  the  advent of  the  Messiah.  In  the  Jews  he  discerns  the  special  subjects of  the  Messianic  economy.  Kathanael  is  an  Israelite  indeed : the  temple  is  the  Father's  house  :  salvation  is  from  the  Jews : the  Jewish  Scriptures  testify  of  Christ :  the  testimonies  to Christ  are  drawn  from  the  three  successive  periods  of  the  peo- ple's training — the  patriarchal,  the  theocratic,  and  the  monarchi-   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   8  DTTBODUOTIOK.  cal :  the  Serpent  in  the  wilderness  prefigures  Christ's  ^^  lifting up,\"  and  the  Passover  His  own  sacrifice  as  the  Lamb  of  God.  The  fooi'th  Gospel  is  the  onlj  one  of  the  four  which  is  de- veloped according  to  a  prearranged  and  systematic  plan.  This plan  may  be  generally  described  as  the  exhibition  of  ^^  the  par- allel development  of  faith  and  onbelief  through  the  historical presence  of  Christ.\"  •  The  Gospel  accordingly  falls  into  two general  divisions :  the  Prologue  (L  1-18) ;  the  Narrative  (L 19-xxi.  23).  The  narrative  consists  of  two  parts:  the  self- revelation  of  Christ  to  the  world  (L  19-xiL  60) ;  the  self -revela- tion of  Christ  to  the  disciples  (xiii.  xxi.).  In  the  development of  this  plan  the  author  dwells  upon  three  pairs  of  ideas:  wit- ness and  truth  ;  glory  and  light ;  judgment  and  life.  ^^  There is  the  manifold  attestation  of  the  divine  mission ;  there  is  the progressive  manifestation  of  the  inherent  majesty  of  the  Son  ; tliere  is  the  continuous  and  necessary  effect  which  this  mani- festation produces  on  those  to  whom  it  is  made ;  and  the  nar- rative may  be  fairly  described  as  the  simultaneous  unfolding of  these  three  themes,  into  which  the  great  theme  of  faith  and unbelief  is  divided  \"  (Westcott).  The  plan  is  foreshadowed  in the  Prologue.  He  who  was  the  Word,  in  the  beginning  with God,  by  whom  all  things  came  into  being,  was  life  and  light — the  light  of  men.  To  Him  witness  was  borne  by  John,  who was  sent  to  testify  of  Him  that  all  men  might  believe  on  Him. But  though  He  was  made  fiesh  and  dwelt  among  men,  though He  came  unto  His  own  home,  though  He  was  full  of  grace  and truth,  the  world  knew  Him  not,  and  His  own  people  refused to  receive  Him.  There  were,  however,  those  who  did  receive Him;  and  to  such  He  gave  power  to  become  sons  of  God through  faith  in  His  name.  They  became  such,  not  in  a  physi- cal sense,  not  of  blood,  nor  of  the  will  of  man,  but  of  God. They  received  of  His  fulness.  Accordingly  the  Gt>spel  treats  of  the  nature  of  Christ,  and  of the  witness  borne  to  Christ  by  John,  by  the  disciples,  and  by  mir- acles. It  goes  on  to  describe  the  conflict  between  the  eternal Light  and  the  darkness  as  embodied  historically  in  the  persist-  *  I  foUow  the  general  aziangement  of  Westcott.   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   INTRODUOnON.  9  ent  opposition  of  the  Jews  to  Jesus.  He  came  to  them  and  they received  Him  not  Tlien  the  other  aspect  is  presented — the blessing  of  those  who  did  receive  Him,  the  impartation  of  son- ship  and  the  couseqaent  privilege  of  communion  with  the  di- vine nature.  From  the  thirteenth  to  the  end  of  the  seven- teenth chapter  is  described  Christ's  revelation  of  Himself  to His  disciples  in  ministries  of  love  and  in  confidential  discourse. The  darkness  did  not  overcome  the  light  The  apparent  de- feat through  death  was  converted  into  victory  through  resur- rection. This  victory  of  the  light  is  unfolded  from  the  eigh- teenth to  the  end  of  the  twentieth  chapter,  in  the  story  of  the betrayal,  the  passion,  and  the  resurrection.  The  twenty-first chapter  forms  an  Epilogue  in  which  the  divine  light  again shines  forth  in  miracle,  ministry,  and  counsel,  before  the  final departure  to  the  Father.  RELATION  TO  THE  8YN0PTI0  GOSPELS.  The  fourth  Gospel  exhibits  marked  differences  from  the others  both  in  chronological  arrangement  and  in  the  selection of  material.  As  regards  the  latter,  it  contains  much  that  is peculiar  to  itself,  and  falls  in  with  the  Synoptists  only  in  a  few sections.  But,  while  independent,  it  is  not  contradictory  of  the  Synop- tic Gk>8pels.  All  the  four  Gospels  are  consciously  based  upon the  same  great  facts ;  and  the  author  of  the  fourth  owns  and confirms  die  first  three.  The  incidents  common  to  the  fourth Gospel  and  all  the  Synoptists  are,  the  baptism  of  John ;  the feeding  of  the  five  thousand ;  the  triumphal  entry  into  Jeru- salem ;  the  last  supper  and  the  passion  and  resurrection.  John, with  Matthew  and  Mark,  relates  the  walking  on  the  sea  and  the anointing  at  Bethany.  John's  Gospel  also  implies  acquaintance  with  incidents  which lie  does  not  relate.  Such  are  tlie  circumstances  of  Christ's baptism ;  the  position  and  character  of  Simon  Peter ;  Christ's early  home  at  Nazareth  and  later  residence  at  Capernaum ;  the number  of  the  disciples;  the  date  of  the  Baptist's  imprison- ment ;  the  Ascension,  etc.  The  same  imagery  appears,  in  the figures  of  the  bride  and  the  bridegroom,  the  harvest,  the  ser-   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   10  INTRODUCTION.  vant,  the  vine.  The  same  sayings  occur,  and  verbal  and  other coincidences  are  freqneut.^  The  inner  coincidences  are  still  more  striking.  John^s  por- trait of  Jesus,  for  instance,  is,  in  many  particulars,  unique.  It is  fuller,  more  subtile,  and  indicates  a  closer  intimacy.  John deals  with  His  person,  where  Matthew  and  Luke  deal  with  His offices.  In  Matthew  He  is  the  f ulfiller  of  the  law ;  in  John He  foreshadows  the  grander  and  richer  economy  of  the  Spirit. Nevertheless,  John's  Christ  is  the  same  figure  which  appears  in the  lines  of  the  Synoptists.  In  both  He  is  the  teacher,  the meek  and  lowly  one,  the  worker  of  miracles  of  power  and mercy.  In  both  He  is  plain  of  speech  toward  those  who  would become  His  disciples,  the  hater  of  hypocrisy,  the  reader  of men's  hearts.  Similar  coincidences  appear  in  the  portraits  of  prominent disciples,  notably  of  Peter.  Though  appearing  in  some  scenes not  noted  by  the  Synoptists,  the  Peter  of  their  Gospels  is  easily recognized  in  the  portrait  by  his  fellow-disciple.  He  is  the same  combination  of  impulsive  boldness  and  cowardice ;  of  af- fectionateness  and  brusqueness ;  as  quickly  responsive  to  love as  to  anger  ;  as  prompt  to  leap  into  the  lake  at  the  sight  of  his Lord,  as  to  smite  Malchus.  The  inner  coincidences  are  also  to  be  discerned  in  John's  as- sumption of  facts  recorded  by  the  other  evangelists,  so  that the  coincidence  sometimes  appears  in  what  he  does  not  record. Giving  no  details  of  the  birth  of  Christ,  like  Matthew  and Luke,  he  tells  us  that  the  Word  became  flesh.  The  childhood, with  its  subjection  to  parental  authority  appears  in  the  story of  the  wedding  at  Cana.  While  the  Synoptists  dwell  upon the  event  of  the  incarnation,  he  dwells  upon  the  doctrine.  The sacraments  of  Baptism  and  of  the  Eucharist,  the  institution  of which  he  does  not  relate,  are  assumed  as  familiar  in  the  con- versation with  Nicodemus  and  in  the  discourse  at  Capeniaum. The  ascension  is  not  described,  but  is  predicted  in  Christ's words  to  Mary.    Similarly,  the  work  of  Jesus  in  Galilee,  which  *  For  a  list  of  theee  ooinotdenoes  see  Westoott^s  Introduotion  to  hia  Oooo- mentary  on  the  Gospeli  in  the  Speaker's  Commentaxy.

The  anointing  at  Bethanj  is  assumed  to  be  known, as  is  the  hearing  of  Jesus  before  Caiaphas«  With  these  coincidences  marked  differences  appear.  Setting aside  the  omission  bj  Mark  of  the  Gospel  of  tlie  infancy,  the Synoptic  narrative  falls  into  thi*ee  parts :  1,  The  ministry  of the  Baptist,  the  baptism  and  temptation  of  Jesus.  2,  The  re- turn of  Jesus  to  Galilee^  followed  by  a  series  of  connected  nar- ratives concerning  His  teaching  and  miracles  in  tliis  and  sur- roanding  districts,  without  any  intimation  that,  during  this time,  lie  also  visited  Judaea  and  Jerusalem.  3,  Uei'eupon  all  the three  pass  at  once  fi*om  the  last  journey  of  Jesus  to  Jerusalem to  the  Passover,  at  which  He  was  crucified.  Hence,  as  Dean Alford  remarks,  '^  had  we  only  their  accounts,  we  could  never, with  any  certainty,  have  asserted  that  He  went  to  Jerusalem during  His  public  life,  until  His  time  was  come  to  be  delivered up.  They  do  not,  it  is  true,  exclude  such  a  supposition,  but rather,  perhaps,  imply  it.  It  would  not,  however,  have  been gathered  f i-om  their  narrative  with  any  historical  precision.\"  Turning  now  to  John's  Gospel,  we  find  Christ's  ministry  in Galilee  between  the  Baptism  and  the  Passion  interrnpted  by journeys  to  Jernsalem.  He  goes  up  to  the  Passover,  on  which occasion  occur  the  cleansing  of  the  temple  and  the  visit  of  Nic- odemus  (iL  13 ;  iii.  1-21).  A  second  visit  is  made  to  an  un- named feast  of  the  Jews  (v.  1),  during  which  He  heals  the  im- potent man  at  Bethesda,  excites  thereby  the  hostih'ty  of  the Jews,  and  delivers  the  discourse  in  v.  17-47.  He  goes  up again  at  the  Feast  of  Tabernacles  (vii.  10),  and,  ten  months later,  appears  at  the  Feast  of  Dedication  (x.  22).  An  interval is  spent  on  the  other  side  of  the  Jordan  (x.  40),  at  Epliraim  in the  wilderness  of  Judaea  (xi.  63-4),  and  at  Betliany  (xi.,  xii.  1), after  which  He  makes  His  triumphal  entry  into  Jernsalem  (xii. 12  sqq.).  According  to  John,  therefore,  between  Christ's  last journey  fi-om  Galilee  to  Jerusalem  and  His  triumphal  entry, there  is  an  interval  of  several  months,  spent  partly  in  Jerusa- lem and  partly  in  the  neighboring  districts ;  while  according  to the  Synoptists  it  seems  that  He  went  from  Galilee  to  Jerusa- lem to  the  last  Passover  only  a  short  time  before  it  began ;  and   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   12  INTRODUCTION.  that  He  had  previously  remained  continuously  in  Galilee  or  in the  neighborhood,  having  taken  up  His  abode  there  at  the  be- ginning of  His  public  ministry.  In  the  Synoptists  the  scene  of  Christ's  work  is  almost  exclu- sively Galilee,  while  John  mentions  only  five  events  connected with  the  GalilflBan  ministry.  On  the  other  hand,  the  fourth Gospel  assumes  a  knowledge  of  Jesus'  activity  in  Galilee  and Peraea  (vi.  1 ;  vii.  1 ;  v.  11,  52 ;  x.  40).  The  difference  between  John  and  the  Synoptists  also  appears in  the  form  of  the  narrative.  The  latter  represent  Jesus'  teach- ing as  dealing  mainly  with  the  humble  peasantry.  It  is  pro- verbial, popular,  abounding  in  parable,  and  the  discourses  are brief.  John  represents  Christ  as  speaking  in  long  and  pro- foundly thonghtfnl  discourses.  While  John  has  nothing  an- swenng  to  the  Sermon  on  the  Mount  and  the  groups  of  par- ables, the  other  evangelists  have  nothing  answering  to  the interviews  with  Nicodemus,  the  Samaritan  woman,  and  the disciples  before  the  Passover.  In  John  the  discourses  are  more di*amatic  and  dialectic ;  in  the  Synoptists,  proverbial,  parabolic, and  prophetic.  Yet  John's  account  of  Jesus'  teaching  is  not wanting  in  short  paradoxical  sayings,  such  as  abound  in  the Synoptists  (see  ii.  19 ;  iv.  32,  34, 35 ;  vii.  33 ;  v.  17  ;  vi.  27,  33, 62) ;  nor,  though  no  parable  is  worked  out  by  John,  are  para- bolic sayings  wanting,  such  as  the  Good  Shepherd,  the  Vine, the  Living  Water,  and  the  Bread  of  Heaven.  In  another  and  deeper  aspect  his  Gospel  stands  related  to  the others  as  completing.  He  alone  has  seized  and  preserved  cer- tain sides  of  the  life  and  teaching  of  the  Lord,  such  as  His  ut- terances as  to  His  eternal  relation  to  the  Father  and  His  eter- nal unity  with  Him  (iii.  13  sqq. ;  v.  17  sqq. ;  vi.  33,  61 ;  vii.  16, 28  sqq. ;  viii.  68,  and  elsewhere).  It  is  to  John,  in  short,  that we  owe  the  view  of  the  speculative  side  of  Christ's  work; while  as  regards  the  relation  of  believers  to  their  Lord,  John gives  us  those  deep  and  comforting  words  concerning  the  mys- tical unity  and  community  of  life  between  Himself  and  His disciples,  into  which  they  will  enter  through  the  Holy  Spirit.  Yet  these  deeper  and  more  mystical  views  were  not  alto- gether  the  outcome  of  John's  characteristic  personality.    They   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   INTRODUCTION.  13  were  also  toned  and  shaped  by  the  peculiar  conditions  of  the Church  and  of  the  religions  thought  of  his  time.  The  conflict of  Christianity  was  no  longer  with  Judaistic  error  ;  no  longer between  the  Gospel  and  the  Law ;  between  circumcision  and uncircumcision ;  but  with  an  essentially  heathen  Onosticism which  appealed  to  the  Church  with  the  claim  of  a  profound insight  into  Christianity,  and  sought  to  wrest  the  Qospel  to  its own  service.  It  has  already  been  remarked  that  the  aim  of the  fourth  Gospel  was  not  distinctively  polemic  John  was impelled  to  write  by  the  pressure  upon  his  own  soul  of  the truth  *'  God  manifest  in  the  flesh,\"  rather  than  by  the  aggres- sions of  heresy ;  but  none  the  less  the  utterances  of  a  Cerin- thus  *  lent  sharpness  to  the  lines  of  the  Apostle's  portrait  of  the Son  of  Man,  and  no  more  impressive  answer  to  such  teaching could  have  been  given  than  John  furnished  in  the  words  of  the Lord  himself  concerning  His  own  pre-existence  and  eternal Gh>dhead,  and  in  His  testimony  that  the  Father  has  created  all things  through  the  Word.  (See  L  3,  14,  33,  34,  49 ;  iii.  13, 14 ;  V.  23,  26 ;  vi.  51,  62  ;  viii  58 ;  xiii.  23  sqq. ;  xvii.  1,  2, 16, 19 ;  xviiL  6, 11,  37.)  THE  EPISTLES.  It  is  generally  conceded  that  the  flrst  Epistle  was  written  at Ephesus.  In  the  Latin  Church  the  opinion  prevailed  that  it was  primarily  addressed  to  the  Parthians;  but  ecclesiastical tradition  knows  of  no  mission  of  John  to  the  Parthians,  St Thomas  being  supposed  to  have  carried  the  Gospel  to  them.  Its  exact  destination,  however,  is  of  little  consequence.  \"  Its coloring  is  moral  rather  than  local.\"  It  is  a  unique  picture  of a  Christian  society,  the  only  medium  of  the  Spirit's  work  among  *  Cerinthos  taught  that  the  world  was  not  made  by  the  supreme  God,  bnt by  another  and  remote  power  which  is  over  the  oniyerse.  Jesus  was  not  bom of  the  Virgin  by  miracoloas  conception,  bnt  was  the  Son  of  Joseph  and  Mary by  natural  generation,  though  specially  endowed  with  justice  and  wisdom. After  the  baptism  of  Jesus  the  Ohrist  descended  upon  Him  in  the  form  of  a dore,  from  that  sovereign  power  which  is  over  all  things.  He  then  an- nounced the  unknown  Father  and  wrought  miracles ;  but  toward  the  end  of His  ministry  the  Ohrist  departed  from  Jesus,  and  Jesus  suffered  and  rose from  the  dead,  while  the  ChziBt  xemiined  impassible  as  a  spiritual  being.

There  is  no  trace  of  persecntion :  \"  the  world  was  pcril- oos  bj  its  sedactions  rather  than  by  its  hostility ; \"  the  dangers were  within  rather  than  withont.  These  facts  give  character  to  the  Epistle  in  two  ways :  First, the  missionary  work  of  the  Clmrch  falls  into  the  background in  the  Apostle's  thonght.  The  world  is  overcome  by  faith  as represented  in  the  Church,  and  the  Grospel  is  proclaimed  by  the very  existence  of  the  Church,  and  effectively  proclaimed  in  pro- portion to  the  Church's  purity  and  fidelity.  Secondly,  attention is  concentrated  upon  the  central  idea  of  the  message  itself rather  than  upon  the  relation  of  the  message  to  other  systems. The  great  question  is  the  person  and  work  of  the  Lord.  The  peculiar  form  of  error  combated  in  the  Epistle  is  Do- cetic  and  Corinthian.^  In  this  teaching  sin  and  atonement have  no  place.  Christ  came  into  the  world,  not  to  redeem  it by  the  remission  of  sins,  but  to  illuminate  a  few  choice  Intel- lects  with  philosophy :  Jesus  is  not  God  manifest  in  the  flesh : Jesus  and  the  Christ  are  distinct:  Jesus'  humanity  was  not  real, but  a  phantasm.  Against  these  views  John  asserts  that  no spirit  is  of  God  who  denies  that  Jesus  Christ  is  come  in  the flesh  (1  John  iv.  2,  3) :  that  he  that  denieth  that  Jesus  is  the Christ  is  a  liar,  and  that  the  denial  of  the  Son  involves  the  re- jection of  the  Father  (ii.  22,  23) :  that  he  who  denies  that  he  is sinful  deceives  himself,  and  impugns  the  veracity  of  God  (i.  8, 10).  The  Word  of  life  which  he  proclaims  was  the  real  hnman manifestation  of  God,  the  human  Christ  whom  he  and  his  fel- low-disciples had  seen  and  heard  and  touched  (i.  1,  2).  Jesus is  the  propitiation  for  sin  (ii.  2).  The  world  is  not  overcome bv  knowledge,  but  by  faith  that  Jesus  is  the  Son  of  God  (v.  *;  5).  The  principal  evidence  for  John's  authorship  of  the  Epistle is  internal,  drawn  from  its  resemblance  to  the  Gospel  in  vocab- ulary, style,  thonght,  and  scope.  There  is  the  same  repetition of  fundamental  words  and  phrases,  such  as  triUh^  love^  light, horn  of  Ood^  abiding  in  Ood.    There  is  the  same  simplicity  of  *  The  Dooetes  held  that  the  body  of  oar  Lord  win  an  immaterial  phantom. Their  name  it  derived  from  8oWt»  (dokeo)  to  i   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   INTRODUCTION.  15  constmction  ;  the  same  rarity  of  particles  ;  the  employment  of the  simple  connective  {/caly  OAid)  instead  of  a  particle  of  logical sequence  (iii.  3,  16) ;  the  succession  of  sentences  and  clauses without  particles  (ii.  22-24 ;  iv.  -4-6  ;  7-10  ;  11-13 ;  ii.  5,  6,  9, 10),  and  the  bringing  of  sentences  into  parallelism  by  the  rep- etition of  clauses  (i.  6,  8,  10 ;  v.  18,  20).  Verbal  coincidences abound.  Such  words  as  ic6<rfio^  (world),  ^0)9  (light),  axorla (darkness),  ^vepoOv  (to  manifest),  ^q>^  auovi^  (eternal  life),  6 aKfiSiPo^  ©609  (the  i*eal  God),  o  fiopoycptf^  t/w  (the  only-begotten Son),  etc.,  are  common  to  both.  Coincidences  of  expression  are also  numerous.    Compare,  for  example,  1  John  i.  2,  3.  Gospel  iii.  11.  4.  xvi.  24.  ii.  11.  xii.  35.  14.  V.  38.  17.  viii.  35.  iii.  5.  46.  8.  44.  13.  XV.  18.  14.  V.  24. 16.  X.  15.  iv.  6.  viii.  47.  V.  4.  xvi.  23.  The  Epistle  presupposes  the  Gospel.  The  differences  are such  as  would  naturally  appear  between  a  historian  and  a teacher  interpreting  the  history.  This  may  be  seen  by  a  com- parison of  the  Prologue  of  the  Gospel  with  the  Epistle.  The Prologue  and  the  Epistle  stand  in  the  same  relation  to  the  dis- courses, as  appears  from  a  comparison  of  the  thoughts  on  life, light,  and  truth  in  the  Prologue  with  passages  in  the  discourses. Thus  compare,  on  Life,  Gospel  v.  26 ;  xi.  25 ;  xiv.  6  ;  Prologue i.  4 ;  Epistle  i.  1 ;  v.  20.  On  Light,  Gospel  viii.  12  ;  xii.  46  ; Prologue  L  4,  7,  9  ;  Epistle  i.  6,  7  ;  ii.  8.  On  Truth,  Gospel viii.  32 ;  xiv.  6 ;  Prologue  i.  9,  14,  17 ;  Epistle  i.  6,  8,  10 ;  ii. 4,  8,  21,  27  ;  iii.  19 ;  iv.  1,  6  ;  v.  20.  The  theme  of  the  Gospel  is,  Jesics  is  the  Christ  in  process  of   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   16  INTRODUCTION.  mwnifesti/ng  His  glory.  In  the  Epistle  the  manifestation  of the  glory  is  assumed  as  the  basis  of  the  exhortation  to  believ- ers to  manifest  it  in  their  life.  The  doctrine  of  propitiation, which  is  unfolded  to  Nicodemus,  is  applied  in  1  John  iii.  1. The  promise  of  the  Paraclete  in  the  Gospel  is  assumed  in  the Epistle  as  fulfilled  (ii.  20).  The  Epistle  deals  with  the  fruits of  that  love  which  is  commanded  in  the  Gospel.  (Compare Gospel  xiii.  34;  xv.  12,  and  Epistle  iii.  11 ;  iv.  7,  11 ;  iii.  14 ;  iv. 12,  20,  21.)  In  the  Gospel  the  divine  glory  is  prominent ;  in the  Epistle,  Christ's  humanity.  The  doctrine  of  propitiation and  cleansing  is  more  fully  treated  in  the  Epistle  (ii.  2  ;  iii.  16 ; iv.  10  ;  i.  7,  9).  The  epistolary  character  does  not  appear  in  the  form.  It  is without  address  or  subscription,  and  bears  no  direct  trace  of  its author  or  of  its  destination.  But  it  is  instinct  with  personal feeling  (i.  4 ;  ii.  12),  personal  experience  (i.  1),  and  appreciation of  the  circumstances  of  the  persons  addressed  (ii.  12,  22,  27 ; iii.  2,  13  ;  iv.  1,  4 ;  v.  18).  The  Second  and  Third  Epistles  contain  no  direct  indication of  the  time  or  the  place  at  which  they  were  written.  They  wei-e probably  composed  at  Ephesus.  That  the  two  are  the  work  of the  same  author  is  apparent  from  their  agreement  in  style  and spirit.  As  related  to  the  First  Epistle,  the  resemblance  between the  second  and  first  in  language  and  thought  is  closer  than  be- tween the  fii*st  and  third.  THE  APOCALYPSE.  This  document  has  given  rise  to  voluminous  controversy  as to  its  author,  its  origin,  its  pui'pose,  and  its  interpretation.  It has  been  held  to  be  a  forgery  in  the  name  of  John ;  to  have been  composed  by  another  writer  in  the  apostle's  name,  not  in order  to  deceive,  but  in  order  to  record  an  oral  revelation  of John ;  or  to  have  been  the  work  of  another  John.  Some  who deny  that  John  wrote  the  Gospel,  have  attributed  the  Apoca- lypse to  him,  and  the  authenticity  of  the  latter  is  maintained by  some  prominent  rationalistic  critics.  The  Apostle  John  was  banished  to  the  Island  of  Patmos, probably  by  the  Emperor  Domitian,  a.d.  95  or  96,  and  the   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   INTRODUCTION.  17  book,  composed  either  during  his  exile,  or,  as  is  more  likely, after  his  return  to  Ephesus,  contains  the  revelation  given  him there  in  a  series  of  visions.  It  is  directly  addressed  to  the Seven  Churches  of  Proconsular  Asia ;  the  number  seven  being representative,  and  not  including  all  the  Asiatic  Churches.  Its design  was  to  encourage  the  Church  during  that  trying  period, predicted  by  Jesus  himself,  between  the  close  of  direct  revela- tion and  the  second  coming  of  the  Lord.  This  encouragement centres  in  the  return  of  Jesus  to  give  His  people  eternal  life and  to  trample  down  His  foes.  As  related  to  the  progress  of doctrine  in  the  New  Testament,  it  represents  the  final  con* summation  in  the  redeemed  Church,  the  heavenly  Jerusalem, which  is  foreshadowed  in  the  rise  and  growth  of  the  Apostolic Church.  The  style  is  figurative  and  symbolical.  It  deals  with  princi- ples rather  than  with  particular  events.  To  the  neglect  of  this characteristic,  and  the  corresponding  attempt  to  link  the  sym- bols and  prophecies  with  specific  historical  incidents  or  person- i^es,  are  due  most  of  the  extravagances  of  interpretation.  Ko satisfactory  argument  against  its  authenticity  can  be  drawn  from its  contents  as  related  to  the  other  writings  of  John.  It  pro- claims the  same  eternal  truths  which  are  asserted  and  vindi- cated in  the  Gospel  and  in  the  Epistles — the  sovereignty  of  God, the  conflict  of  sin  with  righteousness,  the  temporary  triumph of  evil,  and  the  final,  decisive  victory  of  holiness.  As  in  the other  writings,  Christ  is  the  central  figure,  the  conqueror  of  sin and  death,  the  crowning  joy  of  the  redeemed,  and  the  object of  their  adoration.  It  emphasizes  the  divine  hatred  of  sin  and the  certainty  of  the  divine  judgment  of  the  wicked  and  of  the future  bliss  of  believers  in  Jesus.  The  main  idea  of  the  Gos- pel and  of  the  Apocalypse  is  the  same — that  of  a  decisive  con- flict between  the  powers  of  good  and  evil.  The  symbolism  of  the  Apocalypse  is  Jewish,  and  not  Greek or  Boman.  It  is  pervaded  with  the  style  and  imagery  of  the Old  Testament,  and  is  moulded  by  its  historical  and  propheti- cal books.  \"The  book,*'  says  Professor  Milligan,  \"is  abso- lutely steeped  in  the  memories,  the  incidents,  the  thoughts,  and the  language  of  the  Church's  past.  To  such  an  extent  is  this Vol.  IL— 1   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   18  INTBODUCnON.  the  case  that  it  may  be  doubted  whether  it  contains  a  single figure  not  drawn  from  the  Old  Testament,  or  a  single  complete sentence  not  more  or  less  built  up  of  materials  brought  from the  same  source.  .  •  .  It  is  a  perfect  mosaic  of  passages from  the  Old  Testament,  at  one  time  quoted  verbally,  at  an- other referred  to  by  distinct  allusion ;  now  taken  from  one scene  in  Jewish  history,  and  now  again  from  two  or  three  to- gether.'* Thus  the  heresy  of  the  Nicolaitanes  is  the  heresy  of Balaam  (ii.  14) :  the  evil  in  the  Church  of  Thyatira  is  personi- fied in  Jezebel  (ii.  20) :  the  angelic  captain  in  the  war  against the  dragon  is  the  Michael  of  Daniel  (xii.  7) :  Jerusalem,  Mount Zion,  Babylon,  the  Euphrates,  Sodom,  and  Egypt  are  symbols of  the  holy  bliss  of  the  saints,  of  the  transgressors  against  God, and  of  the  judgment  of  the  wicked  (xxi.  2  ;  xiv.  1 ;  xvi.  19  ;  ix. 14 ;  xi.  8).  The  battle  of  Ilar-Magedon  carries  us  back  to  the great  slaughters  in  the  plain  of  Megiddo  (Judges  v.  19 ;  Ps. Ixxxiii.  9 ;  2  Kings  xxiii.  29).  The  promises  to  the  churches are  given  under  the  figure  of  the  tree  of  life,  the  hidden manna,  the  white  stone,  the  iron  sceptre,  the  pillar  in  the  tem- ple of  God  (ii.  7, 17,  27,  28 ;  iii.  5,  12,  20).  Heaven  is  de- scribed under  the  image  of  the  tabernacle  in  the  wilderness  (xi. 1,  19 ;  vi.  9 ;  viii.  3 ;  iv.  6).  The  plagues  of  ch.  viii.  are  the plagues  of  Egypt :  the  crossing  of  the  Red  Sea  and  the  destruc- tion of  Korah  are  blended  in  the  representation  of  the  deliver- ance of  God's  people  (xii.  15, 16).  Of  the  Prophets,  Haggai contributes  the  earthquake  of  ch.  vi.,  and  Joel  the  sun  changed into  the  blackness  of  sackcloth  and  the  moon  into  blood :  Isaiah the  falling  stars,  the  fig-tree  casting  her  untimely  fruit,  and  the heavens  departing  as  a  scroll :  Ezekiel  the  scorpions  of  ch.  ix., the  description  of  the  New  Jerusalem  in  ch.  xxi.,  the  roll  in ch.  v.,  and  the  little  book  in  ch.  x. :  Zechariah  the  opening  of the  seals  in  ch.  vi.  and  the  olive  trees  in  ch.  xi.  The  vision of  the  glorified  Redeemer  (i.  12-20)  is  combined  from  Exodus, Zechariah,  Daniel,  Ezekiel,  Isaiah,  and  the  Psalms.  Along  with  these  coincidences  there  are  certain  contrasts, notably  as  respects  the  doctrine  of  Christ's  coming,  which,  in the  Gospel  and  Epistles  lies  in  the  background,  while  it  is  the main  theme  of  the  Apocalypse.    The  Apocalypse  treats  the   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   INTRODUCTION,  19  impending  judgment  as  external,  the  Gospel  as  spiritaal.  The Apocalypse  describes  the  trinmph  of  Christianity  under  the imagery  of  Judaism ;  the  consummation  being  an  ideal  Jer- usalem  and  an  ideal  worship ;  while  in  the  Gospel,  Judaism appears  in  opposition  to  Christ,  \"standing  without,  isolated and  petrified,  and  not  taken  up  with  it,  quickened  and  glori- fied.\"  The  symbols  of  the  book  are  drawn  from  objects  familiar  to the  writer — the  locusts,  the  eagles,  the  millstone,  the  olive  and palm  and  vine.  The  principal  objection  urged  against  the  common  author- ship of  the  Gospel  and  the  Apocalypse,  is  the  difference  in language  and  style.  This  difPerence  must  be  frankly  admitted. •*  The  language,\"  says  Dr.  Davidson,  \"  departs  materially  from the  usual  Greek  of  the  New  Testament,  presenting  anomalies, incorrectnesses,  peculiar  constructions,  and  awkward  disposi- tions of  words,  which  have  no  parallel.  .  .  .  The  lan- guage is  so  thoroughly  Hebraistic  as  to  neglect  the  usual  rules of  Greek.\"  By  many  eminent  critics  these  differences  are  re- garded as  irreconcilable  on  the  assumption  of  a  common  au- thorship.  On  the  other  hand,  it  may  be  urged  that  these  differences  are largely  intentional ;  that  the  author  departs  from  common usage  under  the  peculiar  demands  of  his  subject,  arising  from the  conditions  under  which  he  writes,  and  his  intent  to  con- form to  the  Old  Testament  style  of  address ;  and  further,  that his  familiarity  with  correct  usage  is  shown  by  other  passages in  the  same  book.  The  Apocalypse,  moreover,  contains  many of  the  words  which  are  peculiar  to  the  Gospel  and  Epistles, such  as  to  witness^  to  tabemacUy  to  keep,  to  overoome^  to  name as  the  expression  of  character,  true  (aXrfSivos;)  in  the  sense  of real;  and  the  figures  of  hungering  and  thirsting^  the  manna, the  Iwing  vxUeTy  the  eJiepherd  a/nd  the  sheep.  It  is,  indeed,  an- swered that,  where  the  same  words  occur,  they  are  used  in  a different  sense ;  but  many  of  these  alleged  differences  disap- pear upon  closer  examination.  The  Hebrew  character  is  only superficially  different  from  that  of  the  Gospel,  which  is  Hebrew in  spirit,  though  the  Greek  is  much  purer,  and  \"  the  absence   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   20  INTRODUCTION.  of  Bolecisms  arises  from  the  avoidance  of  idiomatic  expres- sions.\" *  8TTLB  AND  DICTION  OP  JOHN.  John's  style  in  the  Grospel  and  Epistles  is  marked  bj  simplic- ity and  ease.  It  is  plain  without  elegance,  and  the  diction  is comparatively  pure  so  far  as  words  and  grammar  are  con- cerned, but  anhnated  with  a  Hebrew  genius.  Godet  describes the  style  as  characterized  by  ^^  a  childlike  simplicity  and  trans- parent depth,  a  holy  melancholy,  and  a  vivacity  not  less  holy  ; above  all,  the  sweetness  of  a  pure  and  gentle  love.\"  The  vocabulary  is  meagre.  The  same  expressions  continu- ally recur.  Thus  we  find  <f>m  (light),  23  times ;  Bo^a,  Bo^d^ea-- S(u  (glory,  to  be  glorified),  42 ;  few},  ^v  (life,  to  live),  52 ;  fiap- rvpelvj  iMpnvpla  (to  witness,  testimony),  47 ;  ^uhUhtkuv  (to  know), 55  ;  Koaiio^  (world),  78 ;  wurreveiv  (to  believe),  98 ;  Spyov  (work), 23  ;  Spofia  (name),  and  aXrjBeia  (truth),  each  25  ;  <rrf/ietov  (sign),  17.  The  meagreness  of  the  vocabulary,  however,  is  compen- sated by  its  richness.  The  few  constantly  recurring  words  are symbols  of  fundamental  and  eternal  ideas.  ^^They  are  not purely  abstract  notions,  but  powerful  spiritual  realities,  which may  be  studied  under  a  multitude  of  aspects.  If  the  author has  only  a  few  terms  in  his  vocabulary,  these  terms  may  be compared  to  pieces  of  gold  with  which  great  lords  make  pay- ment\"  (Godet).  A  similar  sameness  is  apparent  in  the  constructions.  These are  usually  simple,  plain,  and  direct.  The  sentences  are  short and  are  co-ordinated,  following  each  other  by  a  kind  of  paral- lelism as  in  Hebrew  poetry.  Thus  where  other  writers  would employ  particles  of  logical  connection,  he  uses  the  simple  con- nective Kol  (and).  For  example  in  ch.  i.  10,  John  means  to say  that  though  Jesus  was  in  the  world,  yet  the  world  knew   *  It  is,  of  oonne,  foreign  to  the  soope  of  thiB  work  to  disonaB  this,  with other  Johannine  questions,  oriticaUy.  Snoh  a  disonssion  must  assume  the reader's  aoquaintanoe  with  Greek.  The  discussion  concerning  the  differences in  language  wiU  be  found  in  Professor  Milligan's  exoeUent  Lecturer  on  the Bevdatum  of  8L  John,  Appendix  II.

Jesus  spake  in  the  treasury,  teach- ing in  the  temple,  (jmd  yety  though  He  appeared  and  taught thus  publicly,  no  one  laid  hands  on  Him.  John  writes : ^^  Tlieee  words  spake  Jesus  as  He  taught  in  tlie  temple,  and  no man  laid  hands  on  Him.\"  He  uses  and^  where  the  antithetic hut  might  be  expected  (i.  5  ;  iii.  11 ;  xv.  24).  There  is  also  a frequent  absence  of  connecting  particles.  There  is  not,  for  in- stance, a  single  one  in  the  first  seventeen  verses  of  ch.  xv. Out  of  the  wealth  of  Greek  particles,  John  uses  only  five.  He abounds  in  contrasts  or  antidietic  parallelisms  without  connect- ing links.  Thus,  \"  the  law  was  given  by  Moses :  grace  and truth  came  by  Jesus  Christ \"  (i.  17) :  \"  No  one  ever  saw  Grod : the  only-begotten  Son  revealed  Him  \"  (i.  18).  Compare  viii.  28 ; XV.  5,  etc.  This  simple  co-ordination  of  clauses  is  assisted  by the  repetition  of  a  marked  word  or  phrase,  so  that  a  connection between  two  statements  is  established  and  the  idea  carried  for- ward in  a  new  direction  (see  x.  11 ;  xv.  13  sqq. ;  xv.  1,  5 ; xvii.  14  sqq. ;  vL  89,  40,  44).  The  narrative  is  direct.  Even  the  words  of  others  are  given directly  and  not  obliquely.  Instead  of  saying  \"  This  is  the  wit- ness of  John  when  the  Jews  sent  to  ask  him  who  he  was,  and he  confessed  that  he  was  not  the  Christ  '* — John  says,  \"  This is  the  witness  of  John  when  the  Jews  sent  to  ask  him  Who  art then  f  and  he  confessed  I  am  not  the  Christ \"  (i  19).  Compare vii.  40  sqq. ;  ii.  3  sqq. ;  iv.  24  sqq. ;  v.  10  sqq. ;  vi.  14 ;  viii.  22 ; X.  2  sqq.  Illustrative  details  are  not  wrought  into  the  texture of  the  narrative,  but  are  interjected  as  parentheses  or  distinct statements  (see  vi.  10  ;  iv.  6 ;  x.  22 ;  xiii.  80 ;  xviii.  40). John's  style  is  circumstantial.  An  action  which,  by  other  writ- ers, is  stated  as  complex,  is  analyzed  by  him  and  its  components stated  separately.  Thus,  instead  of  the  usual  Greek  idiom, \"  Jesus  answering  said,*'  John  writes,  \"  Jesus  answered  and said,''  thus  making  both  factors  of  the  act  equally  prominent (see  xii.  44 ;  vii.  28  ;  i.  15,  25).  This  peculiarity  is  further  il- lustrated by  the  combination  of  the  positive  and  negative  ex- pression of  the  same  truth  (see  i.  3,  20 ;  ii  24 ;  iii.  16 ;  x.  5 ;   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   22  iNTBODUcrnoK.  xviii.  20;  1  John  1, 6 ;  ii.  4,  27).  The  detachment,  however,  ig only  superficial.  The  inner  connection  is  closely  held  in  the writer's  mind,  and  is  impressed  upon  the  reader  by  that  con- stant iteration  which,  upon  a  hasty  view,  savors  of  monotony, but  which  serves  to  represent  the  central  thought  in  its  many- sidedness,  and  to  place  it  in  its  commanding  relation  to  subor- dinate thoughts.  His  frequent  use  of  the  particle  ovp  (there- fore) directs  attention  to  the  sequence  of  events  or  ideas  (iu 22  ;  iii.  25,  29  ;  iv.  1,  6,  46 ;  vi.  5 ;  vii.  25  ;  viii.  12,  21,  31,  38 ; X.  7 ;  xii.  1,  3,  9, 17,  21).  The  phrase  in  order  that  (o/a),  mark- ing an  object  or  purpose,  is  of  frequent  occurrence,  and  exhibits the  characteristic  of  John's  mind  to  regard  things  in  their moral  and  providential  relations.  Thus  iv.  34:  '^My  meat  is in  order  t/iai  I  may  do  the  will  of  Him  that  sent  me ; \"  the  em- phasis lying  not  on  the  process,  but  on  the  end.  Compare  v. 36 ;  vi.  29 ;  viii.  56 ;  xii.  23 ;  xiii.  34 ;  xviL  3.  The  subject  or  the  significant  word  of  a  sentence  is  often repeated,  especially  in  dialogues  (which  are  characteristic  of John's  Gospel),  where,  by  the  constant  repetition  of  the  names of  the  parties  they  are  kept  clearly  before  the  reader's  mind (see  ii.  18 ;  iv.  7  sqq. ;  viii.  48  sqq. ;  x.  23  sqq.  Also  i.  1,  7, 10;  iv.  22;  v.  31  ;  vi.  27;  xi.  33).  The  demonstrative  pronoun  is  habitually  introduced  to  recall the  subject,  when  a  clause  has  intervened  between  the  subject and  the  verb  (see  xv.  5 ;  vii.  18 ;  x.  1 ;  xii.  48 ;  xiv.  21,  26 ;  xv. 26).  The  personal  pronoun  is  frequently  employed,  especially that  of  the  first  person.  \"In  this  respect,\"  says  Westcott, ^^  much  of  the  teaching  of  the  Lord's  discourses  depends  upon the  careful  recognition  of  the  emphatic  reference  to  His  undi- vided personality  \"  (see  viiL  14,  16 ;  v.  31).  The  quotations  are  commonly  from  the  Septuagint,  and  never immediately  from  the  Hebrew.   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   THE  GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  JOHN-   PROLOGUE*   Vv.  1-18.  \"The  Prologue  is  summed  up  in  three  thoughts, which  also  determine  its  plan :  Thb  Logos  :  the  Logos  disowned ; the  Logos  acknowledged  and  regained.  These  three  fundamen- tal aspects  correspond  with  the  three  principal  aspects  of  the history  as  related  in  this  gospel:  the  revelation  of  the  Logos; the  unbelief  of  the  Jewish  people ;  the  faith  of  the  disciples. Between  the  first  part  (vv.  1-5)  and  the  second  (vv.  6-11),  ver.  5 forms  a  transition,  as  vv.  12, 13  connect  the  second  part  with the  third  (vv.  12-18),  which,  in  its  turn,  is  in  close  connection with  the  first.  The  relation  of  this  last  part  to  the  first,  indi- cated bj  the  similarity  of  thought  and  expression  which  may be  observed  between  ver.  18  and  ver.  1,  may  be  expressed  thus : The  Person  whom  the  Apostles  beheld,  who  was  proclaimed  by John  the  Baptist,  and  in  whom  the  Church  believed  (vv.  12-18), is  none  other  than  He  whose  existence  and  supreme  greatness have  been  indicated  by  the  title  Logos.  The  Church  possesses, therefore,  in  its  Redeemer  the  Creator  of  all  things,  the  Essen- tial Light,  the  Principle  of  Life,  God  himself.  The  original link  between  man  and  Ood,  which  sin  had  impaired  (ver.  5),  and which  unbelief  completely  broke  (ver.  11),  is  for  the  believer perfectly  restored ;  and,  by  means  of  faith,  the  law  of  Paradise (ver.  4)  becomes  once  more  the  law  of  human  history  (vv.  16-18)* Thus  the  Prologue  forms  a  compact,  organic  whole,  of  which the  germinal  thought  is  this :  by  the  Incarnation  believers  are  *  I  give  the  arrangement  of  the  Pzologae  aooording  to  Godet   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   24  WORD  STUDIES  IN  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT.  restored  to  that  communion  with  the  Word,  and  that  living  re- lation with  God,  of  which  man  had  been  deprived  by  sin.\"   FIRST  DIVISION  OP  THE  PROLOGUE.    THE  WORD  (1-6).  1.  In  the  beginning  was  (^i^  opx^  ^v).  With  evident  allu- sion to  the  fii*8t  word  of  Genesis.  But  John  elevates  the  phrase from  its  reference  to  a  point  of  time,  the  beginning  of  creation, to  the  time  of  absolute  pre-existence  before  any  creation,  which is  not  mentioned  until  ver.  3.  This  beginning  had  no  beginning (compare  ver.  3  ;  xvii.  6 ;  1  Ep.  i.  1 ;  Eph.  i.  4  ;  Prov.  viii.  23 ; Ps.  xc.  2).  This  heightening  of  the  conception,  however,  ap- pears not  so  much  in  apx^i,  heginning^  which  simply  leaves room  for  it,  as  in  the  use  of  Jjv,  waSy  denoting  absoltUe  existence (compare  elfil,  I  amy  John  viii.  58)  instead  of  iyivero,  came  into bemffy  or  iegan  to  bey  which  is  used  in  vv.  3, 14,  of  the  coming into  being  of  creation  and  of  the  Word  becoming  flesh.  Note also  the  contrast  between  iv  apj(^,  in  the  beginning,  and  the expression  air  apyrfi^froifn  the  beginning,  which  is  common  in John's  writings  (viii.  44 ;  1  Ep.  ii.  7,  24 ;  iii.  8)  and  which  leaves no  room  for  the  idea  of  eternal  pre-existence.  \"  In  Gen.  i.  1, the  sacred  histonan  starts  from  the  beginning  and  comes  down- ward, thus  keeping  us  in  the  course  of  time.  Here  he  starts from  the  same  point,  but  goes  upward,  thus  taking  us  into  the eternity  preceding  time\"  (Milligan  and  Moulton).  See  on  Col. i.  15.  This  notion  of  \" beginning\"  is  still  further  heightened  by the  subsequent  statement  of  the  relation  of  the  Logos  to  the eternal  God.  The  apxfl  ^^^^^  refer  to  the  creation — the  primal beginning  of  things ;  but  if,  in  this  beginning,  the  Logos  already vHiBy  then  he  belonged  to  the  order  of  eternity.  \"  The  Logos was  not  merely  existent,  however,  in  the  beginning,  but  was also  the  efficient  principUy  the  beginning  of  the  beginning. The  apxi  (beginning)y  in  itself  and  in  its  operation  dark,  cha- otic, was,  in  its  idea  and  its  principle,  comprised  in  one  single luminous  word,  which  was  the  Logos.  And  when  it  is  said  the Logos  was  in  this  beginning.  His  eteraal  existence  is  already expressed,  and  His  eternal  position  in  the  Godhead  already  in- dicated thereby  \"  (Lange).     ^^  Eight  times  in  the  narrative  of   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   PROLOGUE.  25  creation  (in  Genesis)  there  occur,  like  the  refrain  of  a  hymn, the  words,  And  God  said.  John  gathers  up  all  those  sayings of  God  into  a  single  %ayi/ng^  living  and  endowed  with  activity and  intelligence,  from  which  all  divine  orders  emanate:  he finds  as  the  basis  of  all  spoken  words,  the  speakmg  Word^* (Godet).  The  Word  (0X6709):  Logos.  This  expression  is  the  key- note and  theme  of  the  entire  gospel.  Aiyo^  is  from  the  root Xey,  appearing  in  \\6y<o,  the  primitive  meaning  of  which  is  to lay  :  then,  to  pick  otU^  gather^  pick  up  :  hence  to  gather  or  pnt words  together,  and  so,  to  speak.  Hence  X6709  is,  first  of  all, a  collecting  or  collection  both  of  things  in  the  mind,  and  of words  by  which  they  are  expressed.  It  therefore  signifies  both the  outward  form  by  which  the  inward  thonght  is  expi*essed, and  tke  inward  thought  itself,  the  Latin  oraiio  and  ratio  :  com- pare the  Italian  ragionarcy  \"to  think\"  and  \"  to  speak.\"  As  signifying  the  outward  form  it  is  never  used  in  the  merely grammatical  sense,  as  simply  the  name  of  a  thing  or  act  (^09, SvofjM,  prjfia\\  but  means  a  word  as  the  thing  referred  to:  the material^  not  ^q  formal  part :  a  word  as  embodying  a  concep- tion or  idea.  See,  for  instance.  Matt.  xxii.  46  ;  1  Cor.  xiv.  9, 19.  Hence  it  signifies  a  saying^  of  God,  or  of  man  (Matt.  xix. 21,  22  ;  Mark  v.  35, 36) :  a  decree,  2l  precept  (Rom.  ix.  28 ;  Mark viL  13).  The  ten  commandments  are  called  in  the  Septuagint, oi  Sixa  Xiyo^,  \"  the  ten  toords  \"  (Exod.  xxxiv.  28),  and  hence  the familiar  term  decalogue.  It  is  further  used  of  discourse:  either of  the  act  of  speaking  (Acts  xiv.  12),  of  skill  a^id practice  in speaking  (Eph.  vi.  19),  or  of  continttous  speaking  (Luke  iv.  32, 36).  Also  of  doctrine  (Acts  xviii.  16 ;  2  Tim.  iv.  15),  specifi- cally the  doctrine  of  salvation  through  Christ  (Matt.  xiii.  20-23; Philip,  i.  14) ;  of  narrative^  both  the  relation  and  the  thing  re- lated (Acts  i.  1 ;  John  xxi.  23 ;  Mark  i.  45) ;  of  matter  under discussion,  an  afPair,  a  case  in  law  (Acts  xv.  6 ;  xix.  38).  As  signifying  the  inward  thought,  it  denotes  the  facidty  of thinking  and  reasoning  (Heb.  iv.  12) ;  regard  or  consideration (Acts  XX.  24) ;  reckoning,  account  (Philip,  iv.  15, 17 ;  Heb.  iv. 13) ;  cause  or  reason  (Acts  x.  29).

John  ases  the  word  in  a  peculiar  sense,  here,  and  in  ver.  14 ; and,  in  tiiis  sense,  in  these  two  passages  only.  The  nearest  ap- proach to  it  is  in  Apoc.  xix.  13,  where  the  conqueror  is  called the  Word  of  Ood;  and  it  is  recalled  in  the  phrases  Wordof  Life^ and  the  Life  was  manifested  (1  John  i.  1, 2).  Compare  Heb.  iv. 12.  It  was  a  familiar  and  current  theological  term  when  John wrote,  and  therefore  he  uses  it  without  explanation.  OLD  TESTAMENT  USAGE  OF  THE  TKBM.  The  word  here  points  directly  to  Gren.  1,  where  the  act  of creation  is  effected  by  God  speaking  (compare  Ps.  xxxiii.  6). The  idea  of  God,  who  is  in  his  own  nature  hidden,  revealing himself  in  creation,  is  the  root  of  the  Logos-idea,  in  contrast with  all  materialistic  or  pantheistic  conceptions  of  creation. This  idea  develops  itself  in  the  Old  Testament  on  three  lines. (1)  The  Wordy  as  embodying  the  divine  willy  is  personified  in Hebrew  poetry.  Consequently  divine  attributes  are  predicated of  it  as  being  the  continuous  revelation  of  God  in  law  and prophecy  (Ps.  xxxiii.  4 ;  Is.  xl.  8 ;  Ps.  cxix.  105).  The  Word  is a  healer  in  Ps.  cvii.  20 ;  a  messenger  in  Ps.  cxlvii.  15  ;  the  agent of  the  divine  decrees  in  Isa.  Iv.  11.  (2)  The  personified  wisdom  (Job  xxviii.  12  sq. ;  Prov.  viii.,  ix.). Here  also  is  the  idea  of  the  revelation  of  that  which  is  hidden. For  wisdom  is  concealed  from  man  :  \"  he  knowetli  not  the  price thereof,  neither  is  it  found  in  the  land  of  the  living.  The depth  saith.  It  is  not  in  me ;  and  the  sea  saith,  It  is  not  with me.  It  cannot  be  gotten  for  gold,  neither  shall  silver  be weighed  for  the  price  thereof.  It  is  hid  from  the  eyes  of  all living,  and  kept  close  from  the  fowls  of  the  air\"  (Job  xxviii.). Even  Death,  which  unlocks  so  many  secrets,  and  the  under- world, know  it  only  as  a  nimor  (ver.  22).  It  is  only  God  who knows  its  way  and  its  place  (ver.  23).  He  made  the  world, made  the  winds  and  the  waters,  made  a  deci*ee  for  the  rain  and a  way  for  the  lightning  of  the  thunder  (vv.  25,  26).  He  who possessed  wisdom  in  the  beginning  of  his  way,  before  His  works of  old,  before  the  earth  with  its  depths  and  springs  and  moun< tains,  with  whom  was  wisdom  as  one  brought  up  with  Him (Prov.  viii.  26-31),  declared  it.     \"It  became,  as  it  were,  ob-   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   PBOLOGUB.  27  jective,  so  that  He  beheld  it\"  (Job  xxviii.  27)  and  embodied  it in  His  creative  work.  This  personification,  therefore,  is  based on  the  thought  that  wisdom  is  not  shut  np  at  rest  in  God,  bat is  active  and  manifest  in  the  world.  ^^  She  standeth  in  the  top of  high  pkces,  bj  the  way  in  the  places  of  the  paths.  She crieth  at  the  gates,  at  tlie  entry  of  the  city,  at  the  coming  in  at the  doors\"  (Prov.  viii,  2,  3).  She  builds  a  palace  and  prepares a  banqnet,  and  issnes  a  general  invitation  to  the  simple  and  to him  that  wanteth  understanding  (Prov.  ix.  1-6).  It  is  viewed as  the  one  giude  to  salvation,  comprehending  all  revelations of  God,  and  as  an  attribute  embracing  and  combining  all  His other  attributes.

The  messenger  of  God  who  serves as  His  agent  in  the  world  of  sense,  and  is  sometimes  distin- guished from  Jehovah  and  sometimes  identical  with  him  (Gen. xvi.  7-13 ;  xxxiL  24-28 ;  Hos.  xii.  4,  5 ;  Exod.  xxiii.  20,  21 ; Mai.  iii  1).  APOOSTPHAL  USAQE.  In  the  Apocryphal  writings  this  mediative  element  is  more distinctly  apprehended,  but  with  a  tendency  to  pantheism.  In the  Wisdom  of  Solomon  (at  least  100  b.o.),  where  wisdom seems  to  be  viewed  as  anotlier  name  for  the  whole  divine  nat- ure, while  nowhere  connected  with  the  Messiah,  it  is  described as  a  being  of  light,  proceeding  essentially  from  God ;  a  true image  of  God,  co-occupant  of  the  divuie  throne  ;  a  real  and  in- dependent principle,  revealing  God  in  the  world  and  mediating between  it  and  Him,  after  having  created  it  as  his  organ — in association  with  a  spirit  which  is  called  fiovoyeve:,  only  begotten (viL  22).  \"  She  is  the  breath  of  the  power  of  God,  and  a  pure influence  flowing  from  the  glory  of  the  Almighty ;  therefore can  no  defiled  thing  fall  into  her.  For  she  is  the  brightness  of the  everlasting  light,  the  unspotted  mirror  of  the  power  of God,  and  the  image  of  his  goodness\"  (see  ch.  vii.,  throughout). Again :  \"  Wisdom  reacheth  from  one  end  to  another  mightily, and  sweetly  doth  she  order  all  things.  In  that  she  is  conver- sant with  God,  she  magnifieth  her  nobility :  yea,  the  Lord  of  all things  Himself  loved  her.    For  she  is  privy  to  the  mysteries  of   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   28  WORD  STUDIES  IN  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT.  tlie  knowledge  of  God,  and  a  lover  of  His  works.  Moreover, by  the  means  of  her  I  shall  obtain  immortality,  and  leave  be- hind me  an  everlasting  memorial  to  them  that  come  after  me  \" (ch.  ix.).  In  eh.  xvi.  12,  it  is  said,  \"Thy  word,  O  Loi*d,  heal- eth  all  things  \"  (compare  Ps.  cvii.  20) ;  and  in  ch.  xviiL  15,  16, \"  Thine  almighty  word  leaped  from  heaven  out  of  thy  royal throne,  as  a  fierce  man  of  war  into  the  midst  of  a  land  of  de- Btraction,  and  brought  thine  unfeigned  commandment  as  a sharp  sword,  and,  standing  up,  filled  all  things  with  death ;  and it  touched  the  heaven,  but  it  stood  upon  the  earth.\"  See  also Wisdom  of  Sirach,  chs.  i.,  xxiv.,  and  Baruch  iii.,  iv.  1-4.  LATER  JEWISH    USAGE.  After  the  Babylonish  captivity  the  Jewish  doctora  combined into  one  view  the  theophanies,  prophetic  revelations  and  mani- festations of  Jehovah  generally,  and  united  them  in  one  single conception,  that  of  a  permanent  agent  of  Jehovah  in  the  sen- sible world,  whom  they  designated  by  the  name  Memra  {word^ X6709)  of  Jehovah,  The  learned  Jews  introduced  the  idea  into the  Targums,  or  Aramaean  paraphrases  of  the  Old  Testament, which  were  publicly  read  in  the  synagogues,  substituting  the name  the  word  of  Jehovah  for  that  of  Jehovah,  each  time that  God  manifested  himself.  Thus  in  Gen.  xxxix.  21,  they paraphrase,  \"The  Memra  was  with  Joseph  in  prison.\"  In  Ps. ex.  Jehovah  addresses  the  first  verse  to  the  Memra.  The Memra  is  the  angel  that  destroyed  the  first-bom  of  Egypt,  and it  was  the  Memra  that  led  the  Israelites  in  the  cloudy  pillar.  USAGE  IN  THE  JUDJBO-ALEXANDRINB  PHIL080PHT.  From  the  time  of  Ptolemy  I.  (323-285  b.o.),  there  were  Jews in  great  numbers  in  Egypt.  Philo  (a.d.  50)  estimates  them  at a  million  in  his  time.  Alexandria  was  their  headquarters. They  had  their  own  senate  and  magistrates,  and  possessed  the same  privileges  as  the  Greeks.  The  Septuagint  translation  of the  Hebrew  Scriptures  into  Greek  (b.c.  280-150)  was  the  be- ginning of  a  literary  movement  among  them,  the  key-note  of which  was  the  reconciliation  of  Western  culture  and  Judaism, the  establishment  of  a  connection  between  the  Old  Testament   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   PROLOGUE.  29  faith  and  the  Oreek  philosophy.  Hence  thej  interpreted  the facts  of  sacred  history  all^oricallj,  and  made  them  symbols  of certain  specnlative  principles,  alleging  that  the  Greek  philos- ophers had  borrowed  their  wisdom  from  Moses.  Aristobalas (about  150  B.a)  asserted  the  existence  of  a  previoas  and  much older  translation  of  the  law,  and  dedicated  to  Ptolemy  YI.  an all^orical  exposition  of  the  Pentateach,  in  which  he  tried  to show  that  the  doctrines  of  the  Peripatetic  or  Aristotelian  school were  derived  from  the  Old  Testament.  Most  of  the  schools of  Greek  philosophy  were  represented  among  the  Alexandrian Jews,  bnt  the  favorite  one  was  the  Platonic.  The  effort  at reconciliation  culminated  in  Philo,  a  contemporary  of  Christ. PhOo  was  intimately  acquainted  with  the  Platonic  philosophy, and  made  it  the  fundamental  feature  of  his  own  doctrines, while  availing  himself  likewise  of  ideas  belonging  to  the  Peri- patetic and  Stoic  schools.  Unable  to  discern  the  difference  in the  points  of  view  from  which  these  different  doctrines  severally proceeded,  he  jumbled  together  not  merely  discordant  doctrines of  the  Greek  schools,  but  also  those  of  the  East,  regarding  the wisdom  of  the  Greeks  as  having  originated  in  the  legislation and  writings  of  Moses.  He  gathered  together  from  East  and West  every  element  that  could  help  to  shape  his  conception  of a  vic^erent  of  God,  \"  a  mediator  between  the  eternal  and  the ephemeral.    His  Logos  reflects  light  from  countless  facets.\"  According  to  Philo,  God  is  the  absolute  Being.  He  calls God  \"  that  which  is : \"  \"  the  One  and  the  All.\"  God  alone  ex- ists for  himself,  without  multiplicity  and  without  mixture.  No name  can  properly  be  ascribed  to  Him :  He  simply  is.  Hence, in  His  nature,  He  is  unknowable.  Outside  of  God  there  exists  eternal  matter,  without  form  and void,  and  essentially  evil ;  but  the  perfect  Being  could  not  come into  direct  contact  with  the  senseless  and  corruptible ;  so  that the  world  could  not  have  been  created  by  His  direct  agency. Hence  the  doctrine  of  a  mediating  principle  between  God  and matter — the  divine  JReasany  the  Logos,  in  whom  are  comprised all  the  ideas  of  finite  things,  and  who  created  the  sensible world  by  causing  these  ideas  to  penetrate  into  matter.  The  absolute  God  is  surrounded  by  \\i\\%  powers  {BupdfjL€i<:)  as  a   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   30  WORD  BTUD1K8  IK  THE  NBW  TB8TAMBNT.  king  bj  bis  servants.  Tbese  powers  are,  in  Platonic  language, ideas ;  in  Jewisb,  angds  ;  bat  all  are  essentially  one,  and  their unity,  as  they  exist  in  God,  as  they  emanate  from  him,  as  they are  disseminated  in  the  world,  is  expressed  by  Logos.  Hence the  Logos  appears  under  a  twofold  aspect:  (1)  As  the  immanent reason  of  God,  containing  within  itself  the  woi'ld-ideal,  which, while  not  outwardly  existing,  is  like  the  immanent  reason  in man.  This  is  styled  Airfo<:  ivSiASero^j  i.e.,  the  Logos  conceived and  residing  in  the  mind.  This  was  the  aspect  emphasized by  the  Alexandrians,  and  which  tended  to  the  recognition  of  a twofold  personality  in  the  divine  essence.  (2)  As  the  outspoken toordj  proceeding  from  God  and  manifest  in  the  world.  This, when  it  has  issued  from  God  in  creating  the  world,  is  the  Aoyo^ 7rpo<l>opuc6^,  i.e.,  the  Logos  uttered^  even  as  in  man  the  spoken word  is  the  manifestation  of  thought.  This  aspect  prevailed in  Palestine,  where  the  Word  appears  like  the  angel  of  the  Pen- tateuch, as  the  medium  of  the  outward  communication  of  Gk>d with  men,  and  tends  toward  the  recognition  of  a  divine  person subordinate  to  God.  Under  the  former  aspect,  the  Logos  is, really,  one  with  God's  hidden  being :  the  latter  comprehends all  the  workings  and  revelations  of  God  in  the  world ;  afFords from  itself  the  ideas  and  energies  by  which  the  world  was framed  and  is  upheld ;  and,  filling  all  things  with  divine  light and  life,  rules  them  in  wisdom,  love,  and  righteousness.  It  is the  beginning  of  creation,  not  inaugurated,  like  God,  nor  made, like  the  world ;  but  the  eldest  son  of  the  eternal  Father  (the world  being  the  younger) ;  God's  image ;  the  mediator  between God  and  the  world ;  the  highest  angel ;  the  second  God.  Philo's  conception  of  the  Logos,  therefore,  is:  the  sum-total and  free  exercise  of  the  divine  energies  ;  so  that  God,  so  far  as he  reveals  himself,  is  called  Logos ;  while  the  Logos,  so  far  as he  reveals  God,  is  called  God.  John's  doctrine  and  terms  are  colored  by  these  preceding  in- fluences. During  his  residence  at  Ephesus  he  must  have  be- come familiar  with  the  forms  and  terms  of  the  Alexandrian theology.  Nor  is  it  improbable  that  he  used  the  term  Logos with  an  intent  to  facilitate  the  passage  from  the  current  the- ories of  his  time  to  the  pure  gospel  which  he  proclaimed.    ^^  To   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   PBOLOGUB.  SI  those  Hellenists  and  Hellenistic  Jews,  on  the  one  hand,  who were  vainlj  philosophizing  on  the  relations  of  the  finite  and  in- finite; to  those  investigators  of  the  letter  of  the  Scriptures,  on the  other,  who  speculated  about  the  theocratic  revelations,  John said,  by  giving  this  name  Logos  to  Jesus :  ^  Tiie  unknown  Me- diator between  God  and  the  world,  the  knowledge  of  whom you  are  striving  after,  we  have  seen,  heard,  and  touched.  Your philosophical  speculations  and  your  scriptural  subtleties  will never  raise  you  to  Him.  Believe  as  we  do  in  Jesus,  and  you will  possess  in  Hini  that  divine  Bevealer  who  engages  your thoughts'\"  (Godet).  But  John's  doctrine  is  not  Philo's,  and  does  not  depend  upon it.  The  differences  between  the  two  are  pronounced.  Though both  use  the  term  Logos,  they  use  it  with  utterly  different meanings.  In  John  it  signifies  wordj  as  in  Holy  Scripture generally ;  in  Philo,  reason  ;  and  that  so  distinctly  that  when Philo  wishes  to  give  it  the  meaning  of  word^  he  adds  to  it  by way  of  explanation,  the  term  fnjfia^  word.  The  nature  of  the  being  described  by  Logos  is  conceived  by each  in  an  entirely  different  spirit.  John's  Logos  is  a  person^ with  a  consciousness  of  personal  distinction ;  Philo's  is  im- personal. His  notion  is  indeterminate  and  fiuctuating,  shaped by  the  infiuence  which  happens  to  be  operating  at  the  time. Under  the  influence  of  Jewish  documents  he  styles  the  Logos an  \"  archangel ; \"  under  the  infiuence  of  Plato,  \"  the  Idea  of Ideas ; \"  of  the  Stoics,  ^'  the  impersonal  Reason.\"  It  is  doubtful whether  Philo  ever  meant  to  represent  the  Logos  formally  as  a person.  All  the  titles  he  gives  it  may  be  explained  by  supposing it  to  mean  the  ideal  world  on  which  the  actual  is  modelled.  In  Philo,  moreover,  the  function  of  the  Logos  is  confined  to the  creation  and  preservation  of  the  universe.  He  does  not identify  or  connect  him  with  the  Messiah.  His  doctrine  was, to  a  great  degree,  a  phOosophical  substitute  for  Messianic  hopes. He  may  have  conceived  of  the  Word  as  acting  through  the  Mes- siah, but  not  as  one  with  him.  He  is  a  universal  principle. In  John  the  Messiah  is  the  Logos  himself,  uniting  himself  with humanity,  and  clothing  himself  with  a  body  in  order  to  save  the world.   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   32  WORD  STUDIES  IN  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT.  The  two  notions  diflFer  as  to  origin.  The  impersonal  God  of Philo  cannot  pass  to  the  finite  creation  without  contamination of  his  divine  essence.  Hence  an  inferior  agent  must  be  inter- posed. John's  God,  on  the  other  hand,  is  personal,  and  a  loving personality.  He  is  a  Father  (i.  18) ;  His  essence  is  love  (iii.  16 ; 1  John  iv.  8, 16).  He  is  in  direct  relation  with  the  world  which He  desires  to  save,  and  the  Logos  is  He  Himself,  manifest  in  the fiesh.  According  to  Philo,  the  Logos  is  not  coexistent  with  the eternal  God.  Eternal  matter  is  before  him  in  time.  According to  John,  the  Logos  is  essentially  with  the  Father  from  all  eternity (i.  2),  and  it  is  He  who' creates  all  things,  matter  included  (i.  3).  Philo  misses  the  moral  energy  of  the  Hebrew  religion  as expressed  in  its  emphasis  upon  the  holiness  of  Jehovah,  and therefore  fails  to  perceive  the  necessity  of  a  divine  teacher  and Saviour.  He  forgets  the  wide  distinction  between  God  and  the world,  and  declares  that,  were  the  universe  to  end,  God  would die  of  loneliness  and  inactivity.  THE  MEANING  OF  LOGOS  IN  JOHN.  As  Logos  has  the  double  meaning  of  thought  and  ypeech^  so Christ  is  related  to  God  as  the  word  to  the  idea,  the  word  being not  merely  a  name  for  the  idea,  but  the  idea  itself  expressed. The  thought  is  the  inward  word  (Dr.  SchaflF  compares  the Hebrew  expression  \"  I  speak  in  my  heart \"  for  \"  I  think  \").  The  Logos  of  John  is  the  real,  personal  God  (i.  1),  the  Word, who  was  originally  before  the  creation  with  God,  and  was  Gt)d, one  in  essence  and  nature,  yet  pei*8onally  distinct  (i.  1,  18) ;  the revealer  and  interpreter  of  the  hidden  being  of  God ;  the  re- flection and  visible  image  of  God,  and  the  organ  of  all  His manifestations  to  the  world.  Compare  Heb.  i.  3.  He  made all  things,  proceeding  personally  from  God  for  the  accomplish- ment of  the  act  of  creation  (i.  3),  and  became  man  in  the  per- son of  Jesus  Christ,  accomplishing  the  redemption  of  the  world. Compare  Philip,  ii.  6.  The  following  is  from  William  Austin,  \"Meditation  for Christmas  Day,\"  cited  by  Ford  on  John :  -  \"  The  name  Word  is  most  excellently  given  to  our  Saviour ; for  it  expresses  His  nature  in  one,  more  than  in  any  others.   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   PROLOGUK  83  Therefore  St  John,  when  he  names  the  Person  in  the  Trinity (1  John  V.  7),*  chooses  rather  to  call  Him  Word  than  Son  ;  for 'word  is  a  phrase  more  communicable  than  wn.  Son  hath  only reference  to  the  Father  that  begot  Him ;  but  word  may  refer to  him  £hat  conceives  it ;  to  him  that  speaks  it ;  to  that  which is  spoken  5y  it ;  to  ^  voice  that  it  is  dad  in ;  and  to  the  effects it  raises  in  him  that  hears  it  So  Christ,  as  He  is  ^  Wordj not  only  refers  to  His  Father  that  begot  Him,  and  from  whom He  comes  forth,  but  to  all  the  creatures  that  were  made  by Him ;  to  th^  flesh  that  He  took  to  clothe  Him ;  and  to  the doctrine  He  brought  and  taught,  and  which  lives  yet  in  the hearts  of  all  them  that  obediently  do  hear  it  He  it  is  that  is this  Word;  and  any  other,  prophet  or  preacher,  he  is  but  a voice  (Luke  iii.  4).  Word  is  an  inward  conception  of  ihe  mmd; and  voiced  is  but  a  sign  of  intention.  St.  John  was  but  a  sign, a  voice ;  not  worthy  to  untie  the  shoe-latchet  of  this  Word. Christ  is  the  inner  conception  ^  in  the  bosom  of  His  Father ; ' and  that  is  properly  the  Word.  And  yet  the  Word  is  the  inten- tion uttered  forth,  as  well  as  conceived  within ;  for  Christ  was no  less  the  Word  in  the  womb  of  the  Virgin,  or  in  the  cradle  of the  manger,  or  on  the  altar  of  the  cross,  than  he  was  in  the  be- ginning, *  in  the  bosom  of  His  Father.*  For  as  the  intention departs  not  from  the  mind  when  the  word  is  uttered,  so  Christ, proceeding  from  the  Father  by  eternal  generation,  and  after here  by  birth  and  incarnation,  remains  still  in  Him  and  with Him  in  essence ;  as  the  intention,  which  is  conceived  and  bom in  the  mind,  remains  still  with  it  and  in  it,  though  the  word  be spoken.  He  is  therefore  rightly  called  the  Wordy  both  by  His coming  from,  and  yet  remaining  still  in,  the  Father.\"  And  the  Word.

The  preposition  irpi^y  which,  with  the  accusative case,  denotes  motion  towards,  or  direction,  is  also  often  used  in the  New  Testament  in  the  sense  of  with;  and  that  not  merely as  being  near  or  hedde^  but  as  a  living  union  and  communion ; implying  the  active  notion  of  intercourse.  Thus :  ^^  Are  not  his sisters  here  with  t^\"  (7r/>09  ij/^a?),  i.e.,  in  social  relations  with  us (Mark  vi.  8 ;  Matt.  xiii.  66).  \"  How  long  shall  I  be  with  you'' {irpi^  vfJM^,  Mark  ix.  16).  \"  I  sat  daily  vnth  you  \"  (Matt.  xxvi. 65).  \"  To  be  present  tjoith  the  Lord  \"  (wpo9  rov  Kvpiop,  2  Cor.

Thus  John's  statement  is  that  the  divine  Word  not only  abode  with  the  Father  from  all  eternity,  but  was  in  the living,  active  relation  of  communion  with  Him.  And  the  Word  was  God  (kqI  Oeo^  ^v  6  X0709).  In  the Greek  order,  and  God  was  the  Wordy  which  is  followed  by Ang.-Sax.,  Wye,  and  Tynd.  But  Oeb^,  Oodj  is  the  predAcate and  not  the  subject  of  the  proposition.  The  subject  must  be the  Word ;  for  John  is  not  trying  to  show  who  is  God,  but  who is  the  Word.  Notice  that  Bei^  is  without  the  article,  which could  not  have  been  omitted  if  he  had  meant  to  designate  the word  as  God ;  because,  in  that  event,  0€O9  would  have  been ambiguous ;  perhaps  a  God.  Moreover,  if  he  had  said  Ood  was the  Wordy  he  would  have  contradicted  his  previous  statement by  which  he  had  distinguished  (hypostatically)*  God  from  the word,  and  lUrfo^  (Logos)  would,  further,  have  signified  only  an attribute  of  God.  The  predicate  is  emphatically  placed  in  the proposition  before  the  subject,  because  of  the  progress  of  the thought ;  this  being  the  third  and  highest  statement  respecting the  Word — the  climax  of  the  two  preceding  propositions.  The word  Oody  used  attributively,  maintains  the  personal  distinction between  God  and  the  Word,  but  makes  the  unity  of  essence  and  *  The  word  hypoiUuU  is  eqoiyalent  to  nibstanee.

'^  There  is  some- thing majestic  in  the  way  in  which  the  description  of  the Logos,  in  the  three  brief  but  great  propositions  of  ver.  1,  is  un- folded with  inci'easvng  fulness\"  (Meyer).  2.  The  same  (0^09).  lit.,  this  one;  the  one  first  named; the  Word.  Was  in  the  beginning  with  God.  In  ver.  1  the  elements of  this  statement  have  been  given  separately :  the  Word,  the eternal  being  of  the  Word,  and  his  active  communion  with God.  Here  they  are  combined,  and  with  new  force.  This same  Word  not  only  was  coetemal  with  God  in  respect  of  heing (^,  wa8\\  but  was  eternally  in  actvoe  communion  with  Him {in  the  heginning  with  God :  w/009  rov  Oeov) :  \"  not  simply  the Word  with  God,  but  God  with  God  \"  (Moulton).  Notice  that here  Oeov  has  the  article,  as  in  the  second  proposition,  where God  is  spoken  of  absolutely.  In  the  third  proposition,  the Word  was  Ood,  the  article  was  omitted  because  Seo^  described the  nature  of  the  Word  and  did  not  identify  his  person.  Here, as  in  the  second  proposition,  the  Word  is  placed  in  personal  re- lation to  God.  This  verse  forms  the  transition  point  from  the  discussion  of the  personal  being  of  the  Word  to  His  manifestation  in  creation. If  it  was  this  same  Word,  and  no  other,  who  was  Himself  God, and  who,  from  all  eternity,  was  in  active  communion  with  God, then  the  statement  follows  naturally  that  all  things  were  created through  Him,  thus  bringing  the  essential  nature  of  the  Word and  His  manifestation  in  creation  into  connection. .  As  the idea  of  the  Word  involves  knowledge  and  will,  wisdom  and force,  the  creative  function  is  properly  His.  Hence  His  close relation  to  created  things,  especially  to  man,  prepares  the  way for  His  incarnation  and  redeeming  work.  The  connection  be- tween creation  and  redemption  is  closer  than  is  commonly apprehended.  It  is  intimated  in  the  words  of  Isaiah  (xlvi.  4), \"  I  have  made,  and  I  will  bear.''  Redemption,  in  a  certain sense,  grows  out  of  creation.    Because  God  created  man  in   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   36  WORD  STUDIES  IN  THE  NBW  TESTAMENT.  His  own  image,  He  would  restore  him  to  that  image.  Because God  made  man,  He  loves  him,  educates  him,  bears  with  him, carries  on  the  race  on  the  line  of  His  infinite  patience,  is  bur- dened with  its  perverseness  and  blindness,  and  expresses  and effectuates  all  this  in  the  incarnation  and  redemptive  work  of Jesus  Christ.  Ood  is  under  the  stress  of  the  parental  instinct (humanly  speaking)  to  redeem  man.  8.  All  things  (irdirra).  'Regarded  severally.  The  reference is  to  the  infiilite  detail  of  creation,  rather  than  to  creation  as a  whole,  which  is  expressed  by  rh  irdvra,  the  all  (Col.  i.  16). For  this  reason  John  avoids  the  word  tcoafjLo^j  the  toorldy  which denotes  the  world  as  a  great  system.

Three  words are  used  in  the  !N'ew  Testament  to  express  the  act  of  creation  : /crl^eiv,  to  create  (Apoc.  iv.  11. ;  x.  6 ;  Col.  i.  16) ;  irouiv,  to make  (Apoc.  xiv.  7 ;  Mark  x.  6),  both  of  which  refer  to  the Creator ;  and  yiyveaSaiy  to  hecome^  which  refers  to  that  which is  created.  In  Mark  x.  6,  both  words  occur.  \"  From  the  begin- ning of  the  creation  {Krlaem)  God  made  \"  {h-oirfo-ep).  So  in Eph.  ii.  10:  \"We  are  His  worknumship  {iroifffia\\  created {/cTurShrres)  in  Christ  Jesus.\"  Here  the  distinction  is  between the  absolute  being  expressed  by  f^v  (see  on  ver.  1),  and  the  comr- ing  into  being  of  creation  {iyhero).  The  same  contrast  oc- curs in  vv.  6,  9:  \"A  man  sent  from  God  ca/me  into  being^^ (iyhfero) ;  \"  the  true  Light  toas  \"  (^).  \"  The  main  conception  of  creation  which  is  present  in  the writings  of  St.  John  is  expressed  by  the  first  notice  which  he makes  of  it :  All  things  came  into  being  through  the  Word. This  statement  sets  aside  the  notions  of  eternal  matter  and  of inherent  evil  in  matter.  *  There  was  when '  the  world  *  was  not ' (John  xvii.  5,  24) ;  and,  by  implication,  all  things  as  made  were good.

And  yet more,  the  use  of  the  term  iyivero,  came  into  beiriffy  as  distin- guished from  i/crla-Sff,  were  created^  suggests  the  thought  that creation  is  to  be  r^arded  (according  to  our  apprehension)  as  a manifestation  of  a  divine  law  of  love.  Thus  creation  {aU things  came  into  being  through  Him)  answers  to  the  Incarna- tion {jJie  Word  hecame  flesh).

The  combination  of a  positive  and  negative  clause  (compare  ver.  20)  is  characteristic of  John's  style,  as  also  of  James'.  See  note  on  ^^  wanting  noth- ing,\" Jas.  i.  4.  4.  In  Him  was  life  {h  avT&  {>^  ^i^).  He  was  the  fountain of  life — ^physical,  moral,  and  eternal — ^its  principle  and  source. Two  words  for  Ufe  are  employed  in  the  New  Testament :  filo^ and  {r<^^.  The  primary  distinction  is  that  ^a>^  means  existence as  contrasted  with  death,  and  filo^y  the  period,  means,  or  man- ner of  existence.  Hence  ^109  is  originally  the  higher  word, being  used  of  men,  while  (fo>^  is  used  of  animals  {^&a).  We speak  therefore  of  the  discussion  of  the  life  and  habits  of  ani- mals as  zoology ;  and  of  accounts  of  men's  lives  as  ^graphy. Animals  have  the  vital  principle  in  common  with  men,  bat men  lead  lives  controlled  by  intellect  and  will,  and  directed to  moral  and  intellectual  ends.  In  the  New  Testament,  filo^ means  either  living^  i.e.,  m^eans  of  subsistence  (Mark  xii.  44 ; Luke  viii.  43),  or  course  of  life^  life  regarded  as  an  economy (Luke  viii.  14 ;  1  Tim.  iL  2 ;  2  Tim.  ii.  4).  Zoi^  occurs  in  the lower  sense  of  life,  considered  principally  or  wholly  as  existence (1  Pet.  iii.  10;  Acts  viii.  33;  xvii.  25;  Heb.  vii.  3).  There seems  to  be  a  significance  in  the  use  of  the  word  in  Luke  xvi. 25 :  \"  Thou  in  thy  lifetime  {iv  rtj  (J»S.  <^oi;)  receivedst  thy good  things;*'  the  intimation  being  that  the  rich  man's  life  had been  little  better  than  mere  existence,  and  not  life  at  all  in  the true  sense.    But  throughout  the  New  Testament  ^(off  is  the   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   PROLOGUB.  89  nobler  word,  seeming  to  have  changed  places  with  filo^.  It  ex- presses the  sam  of  mortal  and  eternal  blessedness  (Matt  xxv. 46 ;  Lnke  xviii.  30 ;  John  xi.  25 ;  Acts  ii.  28 ;  Bom.  v.  17 ;  vi. 4),  and  that  not  only  in  respect  of  men,  but  also  of  God  and Christ  So  here.  Compare  John  v.  26 ;  xiv.  6  ;  1  John  i.  2. This  change  is  due  to  the  gospel  revelation  of  the  essential  con- nection of  sin  with  death,  and  consequently,  of  life  with  holi- ness. ^'  Whatever  truly  lives,  does  so  because  sin  has  never found  place  in  it,  or,  having  found  place  for  a  time,  has  since been  overcome  and  expelled  \"  (Trench).

See  xi.  25 ;  xiv.  6 ;  viiL 12 ;  1  John  i.  2 ;  v.  20 ;  John  vi.  35,  48 ;  vi.  63 ;  Apoc.  xxi. 6;  xxii.  1, 17;  vii.  17;  John  iv.  14;  Apoc.  ii.  7;  xxii.  2, 14, 19 ;  John  xii.  50  ;  xvii.  3 ;  xx.  31 ;  v.  26 ;  vi.  53,  54;  v.  40 ; iii.  15, 16,  36;  x.  10;  v.  24;  xii.  25;  vi.  27;  iv.  36;  1  John V.  12, 16 ;  John  vi.  51.  Was  the  Light  of  men  {fjv  rb  <f>m  r&v  auBpdnmv).  Passing from  the  thought  of  creation  in  general  to  that  of  mankind, who,  in  the  whole  range  of  created  things,  had  a  special capacity  for  receiving  the  divine.  The  Light — the  peculiar mode  of  the  divine  operation  upon  men,  conformably  to  their rational  and  moral  nature  which  alone  was  fitted  to  receive  the light  of  divine  truth.  It  is  not  said  that  the  Word  was  light,  but that  the  life  was  the  light.  The  Word  becomes  light  through the  medium  of  life,  of  spiritual  life,  just  as  sight  is  a  function  of physical  life.  Compare  xiv.  6,  where  Christ  becomes  the  life through  being  the  truth ;  and  Matt  v.  8,  where  the  pure  heart is  the  medium  through  which  God  is  beheld.  In  whatever mode  of  manifestation  the  Word  is  in  the  world.  He  is  the  light of  the  world ;  in  His  works,  in  the  dawn  of  creation  ;  in  the happy  conditions  of  Eden ;  in  the  Patriarchs,  in  the  Law  and the  Prophets,  in  His  incarnation,  and  in  the  subsequent  history of  the  Church.

S/cor^a,  darhtess,  is  a word  peculiar  to  later  Greek,  and  used  in  the  New  Testament almost  exclusively  by  John.  It  occurs  once  in  Matt.  x.  27,  and once  in  Luke  xii.  3.  The  more  common  Kew  Testament  word is  o-kSto^,  from  the  same  root,  which  appears  in  atadj  shadow^ and  a-Kijvij,  tent.  Another  word  for  darkness,  ^o^,  occurs  only in  Peter  and  Jude  (2  Pet.  ii.  4, 17 ;  Jude  6, 13).  See  on  2  Pet. ii.  4.  The  two  words  are  combined  in  the  phrase  UacJcness  of dcvrJcness  (2  Pet.  ii.  17 ;  Jude  13).  In  classical  Greek  o-kAto^^ as  distinguished  from  ^((^,  is  the  stronger  term,  denoting  the condition  of  darkness  as  opposed  to  light  in  nature.  Hence of  death;  of  the  condition  \"before  hvrth;  of  nigJU.  Zoifx^,  which is  mainly  a  poetical  term,  signifies  gloom^  half-darJcnesSj  nebvr Umsness.  Here  the  stronger  word  is  used.  The  darkness  of sin  is  dey^.  The  moral  condition  which  opposes  itself  to  di- vine light  is  vUerly  dark.  The  very  light  that  is  in  it  is darkness.  Its  condition  is  the  opposite  of  that  happy  state  of humanity  indicated  in  ver.  4,  when  the  life  was  the  light  of men ;  it  is  a  condition  in  which  mankind  has  become  the  prey of  falsehood,  folly  and  sin.

This meaning  would  require  the  middle  voice  of  the  verb  (see  Acts iv.  13 ;  X.  34 ;  xxv.  25).  The  Eev.,  ajffprehendedj  i.e.,  gnuped or  seisedi  gives  the  correct  idea,  which  appears  in  John  xiL  35, 'Mest  darkness  come  upon  jou,\"  i.e.,  overUike  and  seize.  The word  is  used  in  the  sense  of  laying  hold  of  so  as  to  make  on^a own;  hence,  to  takepoeeeesion  of.  Used  of  obtaining  the  prize in  the  games  (1  Cor.  ix.  24) ;  of  attaining  righteousness  (Bom. ix.  30) ;  of  a  demon  taking  possession  of  a  man  (Mark  ix.  18) ; of  the  day  of  the  Lord  overtahmg  one  as  a  thief  (1  Thess.  v. 4).  Applied  to  darkness,  this  idea  includes  that  of  eclipsing or  overwhelming.  Hence  some  render  overcame  (Westcott, Moulton).  John's  thought  is,  that  in  the  struggle  between light  and  darkness,  light  was  victorious.  The  darkness  did  not appropriate  the  light  and  eclipse  it  ^^  The  whole  phrase  is  in- deed a  startling  paradox.  The  light  does  not  banish  the  dark- ness; the  darkness  does  not  overpower  the  light  Light  and darkness  coexist  in  the  world  side  bj  side  \"  (Westcott).  6.

It  is  one  of  John's  characteristic  words,  oc- curring nearly  fifty  times  in  various  forms  in  his  Gospel,  and thirty  or  forty  times  in  the  Epistles  and  Apocalypse.  The emphatic  development  of  the  idea  of  witness  is  peculiar  to  this Gospel.  \"  It  evidently  belongs  to  a  time  when  men  had  begun to  reason  about  the  faith,  and  to  analyze  the  grounds  on  which it  rested\"  (Westcott).  He  develops  the  idea  under  the  follow- ing forms :  The  witness  of  the  Father  (v.  31,  34,  37) ;  the  wit- ness of  Christ  himself  (viii.  14 ;  xviii.  37) ;  the  witness  of  works (v.  17,  36 ;  X.  25 ;  xiv.  11 ;  xv.  24) ;  the  witness  of  Scripture (v.  39,  40,  46 ;  i.  46) ;  the  witness  of  the  forerunner  (i.  7  ;  v. 33,  35) ;  the  witness  of  the  disciples  (xv.  27 ;  xix.  35 ;  xxi.  24 ; 1  John  i.  2 ;  iv.  14) ;  the  witness  of  the  Spirit  (xv.  26 ;  xvi.  13, 14 ;  1  John  v.  6).  Note  the  emphasis  attached  to  the  idea  here, by  the  twofold  form  in  which  it  is  put:  first,  generally, yjw  vnt- nesSy  and  then  by  giving  the  subject  of  the  testimony.

Wye,  very  light  (compare  the  Nicene creed,  \"wry  God  of  very  God\").  This  epithet  is  applied  to light  only  here  and  1  John  ii.  8,  and  is  almost  confined  to  the writings  of  John.  A  different  word,  oXi/'^,  also  rendered t'Tue^  occurs  at  iii.  88 ;  v.  31 ;  viii.  13,  and  elsewhere.  The  dif- ference is  that  0X1^3179  signifies  1r%^y  as  contrasted  with  false  / while  aKri^af6^  signifies  what  is  real^  perfect^  and  substantial^ as  contrasted  with  what  is  fanciftdj  shadowy^  countsTfeit^  or merely  symbolic.  Thus  God  is  0X17.^179  (John  iii.  33)  in  that He  cannot  lie.  He  is  oXi/d^i^  (1  Thess.  i.  9),  as  distinguished from  idols.  In  Heb.  viii.  2,  the  heavenly  tabernacle  is  called oKri^ivri,  as  distinguished  from  the  Mosaic  tabernacle,  which was  a  figy/re  of  the  heavenly  reality  (Heb.  ix.  24).  Thus  the expression  true  light  denotes  the  realization  of  the  original  di- vine idea  of  the  Light — ^the  archetypal  Light,  as  contrasted with  all  imperfect  manifestations :  \"  the  Light  which  fulfilled all  that  had  been  promised  by  the  preparatory,  partial,  even fictitious  lights  which  had  existed  in  the  world  before.\"  '*  Onr  litUe  STStems  have  their  daj ; The  J  have  their  day  and  oease  to  be : They  are  bat  broken  lights  of  Thee, And  Thon,  O  Lord,  art  more  than  thej.**  TSNKTSON,  In  Memcriam.

See on  Acts  xvii.  24 ;  Jas.  iii.  6.  Four  words  are  used  in  the  Kew  Testament  for  world :  (1)   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   FBOLOOUB.  45  yij,  landy  grownd^  territory ^  the  ewrthj  as  diBtingnished  from  the heavens.  The  sense  is  purely  physical.  (2)  oucovfjLhnf^  which is  a  participle,  meaning  inhabited^  with  7Q,  earth,  nnderstood, and  signifies  the  earth  as  the  abode  of  men;  the  whole  inhab- ited world.  See  on  Matt.  xxiv.  14 ;  Luke  ii.  1.  Also  in  a  phys- ical sense,  though  used  once  of  \"the  world  to  come \"  (Heb.  ii. 5).  (3)  ala>v,  essentially  timey  as  the  condition  under  which  all created  things  exist,  and  the  measure  of  their  existence:  a jperiod  of  existence  ;  a  lifetime;  a  generation;  hence,  a  long space  of  time ;  an  age,  era,  epoch,  period  of  a  dispensation.  On this  primary,  physical  sense  there  arises  a  secondary  sense, viz.,  all  that  exists  in  the  world  vmder  the  conditions  of  time. From  this  again  develops  a  more  distinctly  ethical  sense,  the covrae  and  current  of  this  world* s  affairs  (compare  the  expres- sion, the  tim£s)y  and  this  course  as  corrupted  by  sin;  hence the  evil  world.  So  Gal.  L  4  ;  2  Cor.  iv.  4.  (4)  /tuia-fio^,  which follows  a  similar  line  of  development  from  the  physical  to  the ethical  sense ;  meaning  (a)  ornament,  arrangement,  order  (1 Pet  iii.  3) ;  (b)  the  sum-total  of  the  material  tmiverse  considered as  a  system  (Matt.  xiii.  35 ;  John  xvii.  5  ;  Acts  xvii.  24 ;  Philip, ii.  15).  Compare  Plato.  \"  He  who  is  incapable  of  commun- ion is  also  incapable  of  friendship.  And  philosophers  tell  us, Callides,  that  communion  and  friendship  and  orderliness  and temperance  and  justice  bind  together  heaven  and  earth  and gods  and  men,  and  that  this  universe  is  therefore  called  Cosmos, or  order,  not  disorder  or  misrule\"  (\"  Gorgias,\"  508).  (c)  That unvoerse  as  the  abode  of  man  (John  xvi.  21;  1  John  iii.  17). (d)  The  sum-total  of  humanity  in  the  world;  the  hn^man  race (John  i.  29 ;  iv.  42).  (e)  In  the  ethical  sense,  the  sum-totcd  of hvman  life  in  the  ordered  world,  considered  apart  from^  alien- ated  from,  and  hostile  to  God,  and  of  the  earthly  things  which seduce  from  God  (John  vii.  7  ;  xv.  18 ;  xvii.  9, 14 ;  1  Cor.  i. 20, 21 ;  2  Cor.  vii.  10 ;  Jas.  iv.  4).  This  word  is  characteristic  of  John,  and  pre-eminently  in  this last,  ethical  sense,  in  which  it  is  rarely  used  by  the  Synoptists ; while  John  nowhere  uses  aUav  of  the  moral  order.  In  this  latter sense  the  word  is  wholly  strange  to  heathen  literature,  since  the heathen  world  had  no  perception  of  the  opposition  between  God   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   46  WORD  STUDIES  IN  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT.  and  sinful  man ;  between  the  divine  order  and  the  moral  dis- order introduced  and  maintained  by  sin.  10.  He  was  in  the  world.  Not  mei*elj  at  His  advent,  but before  His  incarnation  no  less  than  after  it.    See  on  vv.  4,  5.  Was  made  {iyipero).    Came  into  being.

Though  He  was  in  the  world and  was  its  Creator,  jet  the  world  did  not  recognize  him.  This is  the  relation  of  ideas  in  these  three  clauses,  but  John  expresses this  relation  after  the  Hebrew  manner,  by  simply  putting  the three  side  by  side,  and  connecting  them  by  «cal,  and.  This  con- struction is  characteristic  of  John.  Compare  viii.  20,  where  the point  of  the  passage  is,  that  though  Jesus  was  teaching  publicly, where  He  might  easily  have  been  seized,  yet  no  man  attempted his  seizure.  This  is  expressed  by  two  parallel  clauses  with  the simple  copulative.  \"  These  words  spake  Jesus,\"  etc.,  \"  and  no man  laid  hands  on  Him.\"  Him  {axjTov).  The  preceding  hint  (avrov)  is,  in  itself,  am- biguous as  to  gender.  So  far  as  its  form  is  concerned,  it  might be  neuter,  in  which  case  it  would  refer  to  the  lights  \"  the  Word regarded  as  a  luminous  principle^^^  as  it^  in  ver.  5.  But  ainov is  masculine,  Himj  so  that  the  Word  now  appears  as  a  jperson. This  determines  the  gender  of  the  preceding  ainov.  On  the  enlightened  and  unenlightened  nature,  compare  the allegory  in  Plato's  \"  Eepublic,\"  at  the  beginning  of  Book  vii., where  he  pictures  men  confined  from  childhood  in  an  under- ground den,  chained  so  that  they  can  only  see  before  them,  and with  no  light  save  from  a  fire  behind  them.  They  mistake shadows  for  substance,  and  echoes  for  voices.  When  they  are liberated  and  compelled  to  look  at  the  light,  either  of  the  fire  or of  the  sun,  their  unaccustomed  eyes  are  pained,  and  they  imagine that  the  shadows  which  they  formerly  saw  are  truer  than  the real  objects  which  are  now  shown  them.  Finally,  they  will  be able  to  see  the  sun,  and  will  recognize  hini  as  the  giver  of  the   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   PROLOGUR  47  eeasons  and  years,  and  tlie  gnardian  of  all  that  is  in  the  visible world.  \"  When  the  eye  of  the  soul  is  turned  round,  the  whole soul  must  be  turned  round  from  the  world  of  becoming  into that  of  being,  and  of  the  brightest  and  best  of  being,  or,  in other  words,  of  the  good.\"  Notice  also  the  appropriateness  of  the  two  verbs  joined  with the  neuter  and  the  masculine  pronouns.

Except  in  Apoc.  xxi.  7, which  is  a  quotation,  John  never  uses  vio^  to  describe  the  rela- tion of  Christians  to  Ood,  since  he  regards  their  position  not as  a  result  of  adoption,  but  of  a  new  Ufe.  Paul,  on  the  other hand,  regards  the  relation  from  the  legal  standpoint,  as  adop- tion, imparting  a  new  dignity  and  relation  (Bom.  viii.  15  ;  Oal. iv.  5,  6).  See  also  Jas.  i.  18 ;  1  Pet.  i.  3,  23,  where  the  point of  view  is  John's  rather  than  Paul's.  Titcvov^  indicating  the relationship  of  man  to  God,  occurs  in  John  i.  12 ;  xi.  52;  1  John iii.  1,  %  10 ;  V.  2,  and  always  in  the  pluraL  Believe  on  {irurreuova-iv  ek).  The  present  participle,  he- Uevtng,  indicates  the  present  and  continuous  activity  of  faith. The  word  is  used  by  John,  sometimes  with  the  dative  case simply,  meaning  to  believe  a  person  or  thing ;  i.e.j  to  believe that  they  are  true  or  speak  the  truth.  Thus,  to  believe  the Scripture  (ii.  22) ;  believe  me{W.  21) ;  believe  Moeea,  his  wrtt- ingSy  my  words  (v.  46).  At  other  times  with  a  preposition,  ek, iniOy  which  is  rendered  ieUeve  in,  or  believe  on.  So  here,  vi.  29 ; viii.  30 ;  1  John  v.  10.  See  the  two  contrasted  in  vi.  29,  30 ; viii.  30,  31 ;  1  John  v.  10.  To  believe  tn,  or  on,  is  more  than mere  acceptance  of  a  statement.  It  is  so  to  accept  a  statement or  a  person  as  to  rest  upon  them,  to  trust  them  practically ; to  draw  upon  and  avail  one's  self  of  all  that  is  offered  to  him in  them.  Hence  to  believe  on  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  is  not merely  to  believe  the  facts  of  flis  historic  life  or  of  His  saving energy  as  facts,  but  to  accept  Him  as  Saviour,  Teacher,  Sym- pathizer, Judge ;  to  rest  the  soul  upon  Him  for  present  and Vol.  n.— 4   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   60  WOBD  STUDIES  IN  THB  NEW  TESTAMENT.  future  salvation,  and  to  accept  and  adopt  His  precepts  and  ex- ample as  binding  upon  the  life.

There  is  a  progress  of  thought  in  the  three  following  clauses, describing  the  proper  origin  of  a  believer's  new  life.  Children of  God  are  begotten,  not  of  hloody  nor  of  the  wiU  of  the  fleshy nor  of  iJie  will  of  num.  \"  The  new  birth  is  not  brought  about by  descenty  by  desire,  or  by  human  jnnoer^^  (Westcott).

His  divine  nature  was  not  laid  aside.  In  be- coming flesh  He  did  not  part  with  the  rational  soul  of  man.   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   PBOLOGUK  61  Betaining  all  the  essential  properties  of  the  Word,  He  entered into  a  new  rriode  of  being,  not  a  new  hemg.

It signifies  human  naktre  in  a/nd  aooarding  to  its  corporeal  mani- fesUxtion,  Here,  as  opposed  to  the  jpurdy  divine,  and  to  the purely  immaterial  nature  of  the  Word.  He  did  not  first  be- come a  personality  on  becoming  flesh.  The  prologae  through- oat  conceives  Him  as  a  personality  from  the  very  beginning — from  eternal  ages.  The  phrase  hecame  fleshy  means  more  than that  He  assumed  a  hvmwn  body.  He  assumed  krmum  nature entire^  identifying  Himself  with  the  race  of  man,  having  a human  body,  a  human  soul,  and  a  human  spirit  See  xii.  27 ; zL  38:  xiii.  21;  xix.  30.  He  did  not  assume,  for  a  time merely,  humanity  as  something  foreign  to  Himself.  The  in- carnation was  not  a  mere  aociderU  of  His  substantial  being. \"He  became  flesh,  and  did  not  doihs  Simself  in  flesh.\"  Com- pare, on  the  whole  passage,  1  John  iv.  2 ;  2  John  7.

The  following  words,  as  far  as  and  including  Father,  are parenthetical.  The  unbroken  sentence  is:  \"The  Word  be- came flesh,  and  dwelt  among  us,  full  of  grace  and  truth.''

The word  denotes  calm,  continuous  contemplation  of  an  object which  remains  before  the  spectator.  Glory  (Wfav).  Not  the  absolvte  glory  of  the  Eternal  Word, which  could  belong  only  to  His  pre-existent  state,  and  to  the conditions  subsequent  to  his  exaltation ;  but  His  glory  revealed under  human  limitations  both  in  Himself  and  in  those  who  be- held Him.

L  28).  The  divine  glorj  flashed  out  in Christ  from  time  to  time,  in  His  transfiguration  (Luke  ix.  31 ; compare  2  Pet.  i  16,  17)  and  His  miracles  (John  ii.  11 ;  xi.  4, 40),  bat  appeared  also  in  His  perfect  life  and  character,  in  His fulfilment  of  the  absolute  idea  of  manhood.

It  was  the  glory  of  one  who  partook  of  His  divine  Fa- ther's essence;  on  whom  the  Father's  love  was  visibly  lavished, and  who  represented  the  Father  as  His  ambassador.  The  word /u>vo7«yi^»  ordy  hegoUen  (De  Wette  and  Westcott,  \"  only  lorn  \") is  nsed  in  the  New  Testament  of  a  human  relationship  (Luke vii.  12 ;  viiL  42 ;  ix.  88).  In  the  Septuagint  it  answers  to darling^  Heb.,  onlf/  oncy  in  Ps.  xxi,  A.  Y.  xxii.  20 ;  and  to desokUe  in  Ps.  xxiv.,  A,  V.  xxv.,  16.  With  the  exception  of the  passages  cited  above,  and  Heb.  xL  17,  it  occurs  in  the New  Testament  only  in  the  writings  of  John,  and  is  nsed only  of  Christ  With  this  word  should  be  compared  Panl's irporr&roicoqf  first  horn  (Rom.  viii.  29;  Col.  i.  16,  18),  which occurs  bnt  once  in  John  (Apoc.  i.  5),  and  in  Heb.  i.  6 ;  xi.  28 ; xii.  23.  John's  word  marks  the  relation  to  the  Father  as nniqne,  stating  the  fact  in  itself.  Paul's  word  places  the  eter- nal Son  in  relation  to  the  universe.  Paul's  word  emphasizes His  existence  before  created  things;  John's  His  distinctness from  created  things.  Mopoyepi^^  distinguishes  between  Christ as  the  only  Son,  and  the  many  children  (ritcpa)  of  Ood ;  and further,  in  that  the  only  Son  did  not  heoome  (ya4<r^<u)  snch   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   61  WORD  STUDIBS  IN  THB  NEW  TESTAMENT.  by  receiving  power,  by  adoption,  or  by  moral  generation,  but was  (^)  such  in  the  beginning  with  God.  The  fact  set  forth does  not  belong  to  the  sphere  of  His  incarnation,  but  of  His eternal  being.  The  statement  is  anthropomorphic,*  and  there- fore cannot  fully  express  the  metaphysical  relation.  Of  the  Foabher  is  properly  rendered  by  Kev.,  ^^from  the Father,\"  thus  giving  the  force  of  wapi  (see  on  from  Godj ver.  6).  The  preposition  does  not  express  the  idea  of  generor tion^  which  would  be  given  by  iK  or  by  the  simple  genitive, but  of  tm88ion — eeni  from  the  Father,  as  John  from  God  (see vi.  46 ;  vii.  29  ;  xvi  27 ;  xvii.  8).  The  correlative  of  this  is  ver. 18,  \"  who  is  m  ^  bo8om  {ek  rbv  tcoXirov)  of  the  Father ; \"  lit., ^^  into  the  bosom,\"  the  preposition  eh  signifying  who  haa  gone into  and  is  there  ;  thus  viewing  the  Son  as  having  returned  to the  Father  (but  see  on  ver.  18).  Full  of  grace  and  truth  (irXiipff^  x<^to9  teal  akffSetas:). This  is  connected  with  the  main  subject  of  the  sentence :  ^^The Word — ^full  of  grace  and  truth.\"  A  common  combination  in  the Old  Testament  (see  Qen.  xxiv.  27,  49 ;  xxxii.  10 ;  Exod.  xxxiv. 6 ;  Ps.  xl.  10, 11 ;  Ixi.  7).  In  these  two  words  the  character  of the  divine  revelation  is  sunmied  up.  ^^  Grace  corresponds  with the  idea  of  the  revelation  of  God  as  Love  (1  John  iv.  8, 16)  by Him  who  is  life;  and  Truth  with  that  of  the  revelation  of God  as  Light  (1  John  L  5)  by  Him  who  is  Himself  Light \" (Westcott).    Compare  ver.  17.    On  Graoej  see  on  Luke  L  30.  15.

The  expression is  enigmatical  in  form :  \"  my  successor  is  my  predecessor.\" The  idea  of  the  superior  dignity  of  Christ  is  not  a  necessary inference  from  His  coming  after  John,  as,  on  that  interpretation, the  words  would  imply.

These  and  the succeeding  words  are  the  Evangelist's,  not  the  Baptist's.  The word  /idnesa  (irkfiprnfAa)  is  found  here  only  in  John,  but  fre- quently occurs  in  the  writings  of  Paul,  whose  use  of  it  in Ephesians  and  Colossians  illustrates  the  sense  in  John ;  these being  Asiatic  churches  which  fell,  later,  within  the  sphere  of John's  influence.  The  word  is  akin  to  ir\\i]pfi^,  fvJl  (ver.  14), and  to  irkffiipwVi  to  fill  or  complete;  and  means  that  which  is  oamr jplete  in  itedfj  jjlenvtude^  etUire  number  or  quantity.  Thus  the crew  of  a  ship  is  called  irkijpcffui,  its  complemevd.  Aristophanes (\"  Wasps,\"  660),  \"  Toxntav  irXiipiOfM,  the  strni-total  of  these,  is nearly  two  thousand  talents.\"  Herodotus  (iiL,  22)  says  that  the full  term  of  man's  life  among  the  Persians  is  eighty  years ;  and Aristotle  (^^  Polities,\"  iv.,  4)  refers  to  Socrates  as  saying  that  the eight  classes,  representing  different  industries  in  the  state,  con« stitute  ihej)ler(mia  of  the  state  (see  Plato,  \"Republic,\"  371).  In Ephesians  i  23,  Paul  says  that  the  church  is  the  pleroma  of Christ:  t.«.,  the  plenitude  of  the  divine  graces  in  Christ  is  com- municated to  the  Church  as  His  body,  making  all  the  body, supplied  and  knit  together  through  the  joints  and  bands,  to  in- crease with  the  increase  of  God  (Col.  ii.  19  ;  compare  Eph.  iv. 16).  Similarly  he  prays  (Eph.  iii.  19)  that  the  brethren  may be  filled  unto  all  the  pleroma,  of  God :  i.e.j  that  they  may  be filled  with  the  fulness  which  God  imparts.

The  preposition  avrl originally  means  (yoer  agamst;  opposite;  before  (in  a  local  sense). Through  the  idea  of  placing  one  thing  over  against  another  is developed  that  of  exchange.  Thus  Herodotus  (iii,,  69),  \"  They bought  the  island,  avrl  x/w7A*aT0)y,ybf  money.\"  So  Matt.  v.  38, \"An  eye  for  (ami)  an  eye,\"  etc.  This  idea  is  at  the  root  of  the peculiar  sense  in  which  the  preposition*  is  used  here.  We  re- ceived, not  Kew  Testament  grace  mstead  of  Old  Testament grace ;  nor  simply,  grace  added  to  grace ;  but  new  grace  im- parted as  the  former  measure  of  grace  has  been  received  and improved.  \"To  have  realized  and  used  one  measure  of  grace, was  to  have  gained  a  larger  measure  (as  it  were)  in  eajchange for  it.\"  Consequently,  oontimumey  unintermitted  grace.  The idea  of  the  development  of  one  grace  from  another  is  elaborated by  Peter  (2  Pet.  L  6),  on  which  see  notes.

In  this  sense  even  Christ  was  not  seen  as  God. The  verb  opc£a>,  to  see^  denotes  a  physical  act,  bnt  emphasizes the  mental  discernment  accompanying  it,  and  points  to  the  re- salt  rather  than  to  the  act  of  vision.

The  expression o  &v,  who  18^  or  the  one  heingj  is  explained  in  two  ways :  1.

While  the  fact  of  Christ's  return  to  the  Father's  glory  may have  been  present  to  the  writer's  mind,  and  have  helped  to  de- termine the  form  of  the  statement,  to  emphasize  that  fact  in this  connection  would  seem  less  consistent  with  the  course  of thought  in  the  Prologue  than  the  other  interpretation ;  since John  is  declaring  in  this  sentence  the  competency  of  the  incar- nate Son  to  manifest  Ood  to  mankind.  The  ascension  of  Christ is  indeed  bound  up  with  that  truth,  but  is  not,  in  the  light  of the  pi*evious  course  of  thought,  its  primary  factor.  That  is rather  the  eternal  oneness  of  the  Word  with  Ood;  which,  though passing  through  the  phase  of  incarnation,  nevertheless  remains unbroken  (iii.  13).  Thus  Godet,  aptly :  ^'The  quality  attributed to  Jesus,  of  being  the  perfect  revealer  of  the  divine  Being,  is founded  on  Uis  intimate  and  perfect  relation  to  Ood  Himself.\"  The  phrase,  in  the  bosom  of  the  Father^  depicts  this  eternal relation  as  essentially  a  relation  of  l/yoe  ;  the  figure  being  used of  the  relation  of  husband  and  wife  (Deut.  xiii.  6) ;  of  a  father to  an  infant  child  (Num.  xi.  12),  and  of  the  affectionate  protec- tion and  rest  afforded  to  Lazarus  in  Paradise  (Luke  xvi  23). The  force  of  the  preposition  eU,  intOj  according  to  the  first  in- terpretation of  who  isy  is  akin  to  that  of  '^  vnth  Ood  \"  (see  on ver.  1) ;  denoting  an  ever  active  relation,  an  eternal  going  forth and  returning  to  the  Father's  bosom  by  the  Son  in  His  eternal work  of  love.  He  ever  goes  forth  from  that  element  of  grace and  love  and  i*etums  to  it.  That  element  is  His  life.  He  is there  ^'  because  He  plunges  into  it  by  His  unceasing  action \" (Godet).   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   PBOLOOUB.  61  He  (iiceiuos).  Strongly  emphatic,  and  pointing  to  the  eternal Son.  This  pronoun  is  used  bj  John  more  frequently  than  bj any  other  writer.  It  occurs  seventy-two  times,  and  not  only  as denoting  the  more  distant  subject,  but  as  denoting  and  laying special  stress  on  the  person  or  thing  immediately  at  hand,  or possessing  pre-eminently  the  quality  which  is  immediately  in question.  Thus  Jesus  applies  it  to  Himself  as  the  person  for whom  the  healed  blind  man  is  inquiring :  '^  It  is  j5^  (^^09) that  talketh  with  thee  ^  (John  ix.  37).  So  here,  \"  the  only-be- gotten  Son  who  is  in  the  bosom  of  the  Father — Me  hath  de- clared Him.**  Hath  declared  (^fT/i^aro).  Or,  rendering  the  aorist  strictly, Se  declared.  From  ix,  farthj  and  fffiofuu^  to  lead  the  way. Orig.,  to  lead  or  govern.  Hence,  like  the  Lat  jpraeire  verbis^  to go  before  with  words^  to  preeoribe  or  dictate  a  form  of  words. To  draw  out  in  narrative^  to  recount  or  rehearse  (see  Acts  xv. 14^  and  on  Luke  zxiv.  35).  To  relate  m  fvU  ;  to  interpret^  or translate.  Therefore  i^fypiiTis*  exegesisy  is  interpretation  or  ess- planation.  The  word  i^frffrni^  was  used  by  the  Greeks  of  an eospounder  of  oracles,  dreams,  omens,  or  sacred  rites.  Thus Croesus,  finding  the  suburbs  of  Sardis  alive  with  serpents,  sent to  the  soothsayers  {i^WH'^^)  of  Telmessus  (Hei*odotus,  L,  78). The  word  thus  comes  to  mean  a  spiritual  director.  Plato  calls Apollo  the  ttUelary  director  {irarp^  ^t'TTT^)  of  religion (\"  Republic,^  427),  and  says,  \"  Let  the  priests  be  interpreters  for life  ^  C^  Laws,''  759).  In  the  Septuagint  the  word  is  used  of  the magicians  of  Pharaoh's  court  (6en.  xli.  8,  24),  and  the  kindred verb  of  teaching  or  interpreting  concerning  leprosy  (Levit  xiv. 57).  John's  meaning  is  that  tiie  Word  revealed  or  m^amifested and  interpreted  the  Father  to  men.  The  word  occurs  only  here in  John's  writings.  Wye.  renders,  He  hath  told  out.  These words  conclude  the  Prologue.  Thb  Hjstobioal  Nabrative  now  begins^  and  falls  into  two general  divisions.   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   62  WORD  STUDIES  IN  THB  NEW  TESTAMENT.   I.

This  use  of  the  pronoun, calling  the  reader's  attention  to  what  follows,  and  preparing him  for  it,  is  frequent  in  John.  Sometimes  the  pronoun  carries the  sense  of  qiudity  :  of  this  character.  See  iii.  19 ;  xv.  12 ;  1 John  V.  4,  9, 11, 14.  Witness  (jiaprvpla).  Testimony.

It  occurs  more  than  fifty  times  in  his  Gk)spel  as  his  own expression,  while  there  are  six  instances  of  the  formula  King of  the  Jeios  used  by  Gentiles.  In  the  Synoptic  Gospels,  on  the other  hand,  to  twelve  instances  of  ICing  of  the  Jeu>8y  there  are but  four  passages  in  which  the  word  Jews  occurs.  In  PauPs writings  it  is  comparatively  rare,  mostly  in  contrast  with  Greek, and  both  in  contrast  with  Christianity.  In  the  Apocalypse  it is  found  twice  (ii.  9 ;  iii.  9),  of  those  who  say  they  are  Jews  and are  not,  but  are  \" of  the  synagogue  of  Satan  \"  and  \"do  lie.\"  John,  in  the  Gospel,  distinguishes  between  the  muMitude  (o ^Xo9)  and  the  Jews  (lovBaSot).  By  the  former  he  means  the aggregate  of  the  Jewish  inhabitants  of  Palestine,  the  mass  of the  people,  chiefly  Galilseans ;  by  the  latter,  more  particularly Jud»ans,  the  leaders  of  Judaism  in  opposition  to  tfesus.  The midtitude  are  unsettled  in  conviction,  inquisitive,  despised  by  the Pharisees,  inclined  to  listen  to  Jesus  and  to  believe ;  moved  by an  impulse  to  make  Him  a  king,  escorting  Him  triumphantly into  Jerusalem,  and  not  appearing  in  the  narrative  of  the  trial  *  I  take  this  diyision  from  Westoott.

They  represent  the  narrow,  sectarian  aspect of  Judaism ;  they  are  the  instigators  and  leaders  of  the  opposi- tion to  Jesus,  and  to  them  His  crucifixion  is  attributed.  John uses  the  word  where  the  other  Evangelists  speak  of  the  op- posers  of  Christ  as  Pharisees,  Saddncees,  elders,  chief -priests, scribes,  or  lawyers.  He  recognizes  the  distinction  between Pharisee  and  Sadducee,  and  though  he  does  not  mention  the latter  by  name,  he  characterizes  them  by  their  position.  Jesus is  the  key  to  the  sense  in  which  John  employs  the  term  Jem^. He  regards  them  in  their  relation  to  Him.  The  idea  underly- ing the  word  is  habitually  that  of  separation  from  the  character and  privileges  of  a  true  Israelite  through  their  rejection  of Jesus.*  Sent  {pnrkcreCKxw).

The  diminu- tive apvlov,  a  little  lamb,  is  found  once  in  the  Gospel  (xxi  15), often  in  the  Apocalypse,  but  only  of  the  glorified  Redeemer, and  nowhere  else  in  the  New  Testament.  In  some  instances the  word  may  emphasize  the  gentle  and  innocent  character  of Jesus  suffering  to  expiate  the  sins  of  men  (Apoc.  v.  6, 12 ;  xiii. 8) ;  but  it  is  also  employed  in  describing  Him  as  indignant (Apoc.  vi.  16) ;  as  victorume  (Apoc.  xvii.  4) ;  as  ^  object  of adoration  (Apoc.  v.  8) ;  and  as  enthroned  (Apoc.  v.  13 ;  vii. 17).  The  term,  the  Larnh  of  God  (note  the  article),  is  evidently nsed  here  by  the  Baptist  in  some  sense  understood  by  his hearers,  and  points  to  Isa.  liii.

Three  words  are  used  in  the  \"New  Testa- ment for  man :  i^fyqv  or  ap<nfv,  avfip^  and  iv^p^airof;.  \"Apcrpf marks  merely  the  sexual  distinction,  male  (Bom.  i.  27 ;  Apoc xii.  5, 13).  ^Avqp  denotes  the  man  as  distinguished  from  the woman,  as  male  or  as  a  husband  (Acts  viii.  12 ;  Matt.  i.  16),  or from  a  hoy  (Matt.  xiv.  21).  Also  man  as  endowed  with  courage, intelligence,  strength,  and  other  noble  attributes  (1  Cor.  xiii. 11 ;  Eph.  iv.  13 ;  Jas.  iii.  2).  \"AvSpayn-o^  is  generic,  without  distinction  of  sex,  a  human heing  (John  xvi.  21),  though  often  used  in  connections  which indicate  or  imply  sex,  as  Matt.  xix.  10 ;  x.  35.

Of  man  as  distinguished  from  animals  or  plants (Matt.  iv.  19 ;  2  Pet.  ii.  16),  and  from  Ood,  Christ  as  divine and  angels  (Matt«  x.  32 ;  John  x.  33  ;  Luke  ii.  15).

The  more  honorable  and  noble  sense  thus  attaches  to  atnip rather  than  to  Sv^p^nnro^.

The name  of  James  the  elder  also  does  not  appear,  nor  that  of Salome,  the  Evangelist's  mother,  who  is  mentioned  by  name  in Mark's  Gospel  (xv.  40 ;  xvi.  1).  The  omission  of  his  own  name is  the  more  significant  from  the  fact  that  he  is  habitually  ex- act in  defining  the  names  in  his  narrative.  Compare  the  sim- ple designation  Simon  (i.  42)  with  subsequent  occurrences  of his  name  after  his  call,  as  L  42 ;  xiii.  6 ;  xxi.  15,  etc  Also Thomas  (xi.  16 ;  xx.  24 ;  xxi.  2) ;  Judas  Iscariot  (vi.  71 ;  xii.  4 ; xiii.  2,  26) ;  the  other  Judas  (xiv.  22).

The  question  is  whether  this  is  to  be  reck- oned according  to  the  Jewish  or  tlie  Boman  method  of  com- putation. The  Jewish  method,  employed  by  the  other  Evan- gelists, begins  the  day  at  sunrise ;  so  that,  according  to  this, the  tenth  hour  would  be  four  o'clock  in  the  afternoon.  The Homan  method,  like  our  own,  reckons  from  midnight ;  accord- ing to  which  the  tenth  hour  would  be  ten  o'clock  in  the  morn- ing. The  weight  of  the  argument  seems,  on  the  whole,  to  be in  favor  of  the  Jewish  method,  which  is  nndoubtedly  assumed by  John  in  xi.  9.  The  Greeks  of  Asia  Minor,  for  whom  John wrote,  had  tlie  Jewish  method,  received  from  the  Babylonians. Godet  cites  an  incident  from  the  '^  Sacred  Discourses  \"  of  Aelius Aristides,  a  Greek  sophist  of  the  second  century,  and  a  con- temporary of  Polycarp.  God  having  commanded  him  to  take a  bath,  he  chose  the  sixth  hour  as  the  most  favorable  to  health. It  being  winter,  and  the  bath  a  cold  one,  the  hour  was  mid- day;  for  he  said  to  his  friend  who  kept  him  waiting,  '^Seest thou  the  shadow  is  already  turning?\"  Even  Canon  West- cott,  who  advocates  the  Eoman  method,  admits  that  ^^this mode  of  reckoning  was  unusual  in  ancient  times,\"  and  that  ^^  the Bomans  and  Greeks,  no  less  than  the  Jews,  reckoned  their hours  from  sunrise,\"  though  the  Bomans  reckoned  their  owU days  from  midnight,  and  the  tenth  hour  is  named  as  a  late hour,  when  soldiers  took  their  repast  or  were  allowed  to  rest Thus  Livy,  in  his  account  of  the  Boman  attack  on  Sutrium says,  ^'  About  the  tenth  hour  the  consul  ordered  his  men  a  re- past, and  gave  directions  that  they  should  be  ready  in  arms  at   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   72  WORD  STX7DIBS  IN  THB  NEW  TESTAMENT.  whatever  time  of  the  day  or  night  he  should  give  the  signal. •  .  «  After  refreshing  themselves,  they  consigned  them- selves to  rest  **  (ix.,  37),  Aristophanes  says, \"  When  the  shadow  on  the  dial  is  ten  feet long,  then  go  to  dinner\"  (\"Ecclesiazusse,\"  648),  and  Horace, \"  Yoo will  dine  with  me  to  day.

It  is  objected  that  the  time  from  four  o'clock  to the  dose  of  the  day  would  not  have  been  described  as  that  day; but  beyond  the  marking  of  the  specific  hour  of  accompanying Jesus  as  the  first  hour  of  his  Christian  life,  John  would  not  have been  unlikely  to  use  a  looser  and  more  popular  form  of  speech in  indicating  the  length  of  the  stay  with  Jesus,  meaning  simply that  they  remained  with  him  during  the  remainder  of  the  day, and,  no  doubt,  prolonged  their  conversation  into  the  night*  40.

Son  of  man.  See  on  Luke  vi.  23.  Notice  the  titles  suc- cessively applied  to  our  Lord  in  this  chapter :  the  greater  Suc- cessor of  the  Baptist,  the  Lamb  of  God,  the  Son  of  Gh>d,  the Messiah,  the  King  of  Israel.  These  were  all  given  by  others. The  title  Son  of  man  He  applies  to  Himself.  In  John's  Gospel,  as  in  the  Synoptists,  this  phrase  is  used only  by  Christ  in  speaking  of  Himself ;  and  elsewhere  only  in Acts  vii.  56,  where  the  name  is  applied  to  Him  by  Stephen. It  occurs  less  frequently  in  John  than  in  the  Synoptists,  being found  in  Matthew  thirty  times,  in  Mark  thirteen,  and  in  John twelve.  Jesus'  use  of  the  term  here  is  explained  in  two  ways.  L  That  He  borrows  the  title  from  the  Old  Testament  to designate  Himself  either  (a)  as  a  prophety  as  in  Ezek.  ii.  13 ; iii.  1,  etc  ;  or  {b)  as  the  Messiahy  as  prefigured  in  Dan.  vii.  13. This  prophecy  of  Daniel  had  obtained  such  wide  currency  that the  Messiah  was  called  Ananij  or  the  man  of  the  dottda.  (a.)  This  is  untenable,  because  in  Ezekiel,  as  everywhere  in the  Old  Testament,  the  phrase  Son  of  vnan^  or  Som  of  men,  is used  to  describe  man  under  his  human  limitations,  as  weak, fallible,  and  incompetent  by  himself  to  be  a  divine  agent  (ft.)  The  allusion  to  Daniel's  prophecy  is  admitted ;  but Jesus  does  not  mean  to  say,  *^  I  am  the  Messiah  who  is  pre- figured by  Daniel.\"  A  political  meaning  attached  in  popular conception  to  the  term  Messiah  ;  and  it  is  noticeable  through- out John's  Gospel  that  Jesus  carefully  avoids  using  that  term before  the  people,  but  expresses  the  thing  itself  by  circumlo- cution,  in  order  to  avoid  the  complication  which  Uie  popular   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   78  WORD  STUDIES  m  THE  NBW  TESTAMENT.  understanding  would  have  introdaced  into  his  work.  See  viii. 24,  25  ;  X.  24,  26.  Moreover,  the  phrase  Son  of  man  was  not  generally  applied to  the  Messiah.  On  the  contrary,  v.  27  and  xii.  84  show  that it  was  set  off  against  that  term.  Compare  Matt.  xvi.  18,  15. Son  of  Ood  is  the  Messianic  title,  which,  with  one  exception, appears  in  confessions  (i.  34,  49 ;  xi.  27  ;  xx.  31).*  In  Daniel  the  reference  is  exclusively  to  the  final  stage  of human  affairs.  The  point  is  the  final  establishment  of  the divine  kingdom.  Moreover,  Daniel  does  not  say  \"  ths  Son  of man,\"  but  \"  one  like  a  Son  of  man.\"  Compare  Apoc.  i.  13 ; xiv.  14,  where  also  the  article  is  omitted.  II.  The  second,  and  correct  explanation  is  that  the  phrase Son  of  man  is  the  expression  of  Christ's  self -consciousness  as being  related  to  humanity  as  a  whole :  denoting  His  real  parti- cipation in  human  nature,  and  designating  Himself  as  the  rep- resentative man.  It  thus  corresponds  with  the  passage  in Daniel,  where  the  earthly  kingdoms  are  represented  by  beasts, but  the  divine  kingdom  by  a  Son  of  man.  Hence,  too,  the word  dvBpayn-o^  is  purposely  used  (see  on  a  fmm,  ver.  30,  and compare  John  viii.  40).  While  the  human  element  was  thus  emphasized  in  the phrase,  the  consciousness  of  Jesus,  as  thus  expressed,  did  not exclude  His  divine  nature  and  claims,  but  rather  regarded these  through  the  medium  of  His  humanity.  He  showed  Him- self divine  in  being  thus  profoundly  human.  Hence  two aspects  of  the  phrase  appear  in  John,  as  in  the  Synoptists. The  one  regards  His  earthly  life  and  work,  and  involves  His being  despised ;  His  accommodation  to  the  conditions  of  hu- man life ;  the  partial  veiling  of  His  divine  nature ;  the  lov- ing character  of  His  mission ;  His  liability  to  misinterpreta- tion ;  and  His  outlook  upon  a  consummation  of  agony.  On the  other  hand,  He  is  possessed  of  supreme  authority ;  He  is about  His  Father's  work ;  He  reveals  glimpses  of  His  divine   *  In  John  is.  85,  where  Jesus  himself  formulates  a  confession,  the  reading is  disputed ;  three  of  the  leading  MSS.  reading  Son  af  man.

See  Matt.  viii.  20 ;  xi.  19  ;  xii.  8,  32 ;  xiii.  37 ;  xvi.  13  ;  xx. 18 ;  xxvL  64 ;  Mark  viii  81,  88 ;  xiv.  21 ;  Luke  ix.  26,  58 ;  xii. 8  ;  xviL  22  ;  xix.  10  ;  xxii  69.  The  other  aspect  is  related  to  the  future.  He  has  visions  of another  life  of  glory  and  dominion;  though  present  in  the flesh,  His  coming  is  still  future,  and  will  be  followed  by  a  judg- ment which  is  committed  to  Him,  and  by  the  final  glory  of His  redeemed  in  His  heavenly  kingdom.  See  Matt.  x.  23 ;  xiii. 40  sqq. ;  xvi.  27  sqq. ;  xix.  28 ;  xxiv.  27,  37,  44 ;  xxv.  31  sqq. ; Mark  xiii  26 ;  Luke  vL  22 ;  xvii.  24,  30 ;  xviiL  8 ;  xxi.  27.

The  verb,  therefore,  originally,  means  to  hale  out  hUge-^iJoater ; thence,  generally,  to  drawy  as  from  a  well  (iv.  15).  Canon Westcott  thinks  that  the  water  which  was  changed  into  wine was  not  taken  from  the  vessels  of  purification,  but  that  the  ser- vants were  bidden,  after  they  had  filled  the  vessels  with  water, to  continue  drawing  from  the  well  or  spring.

Others  as  meaning one  of  the  guests  selected  to  preside  at  the  banquet  according to  the  Greek  and  Boman  usage.  This  latter  view  seems  to  be supported  by  a  passage  in  Ecclesiasticus  (xxxv.  1,  2) :  \"  If  thon be  made  the  master  of  a  f^ast,  lift  not  thyself  up,  but  be  among them  as  one  of  the  rest ;  take  diligent  care  for  them,  and  so sit  down.  And  when  thou  hast  done  all  thy  office,  take  thy place,  that  thou  mayst  be  merry  with  them,  and  receive  a crown  for  thy  well  ordering  of  the  feast\"  According  to  the Greek  and  Roman  custom,  the  ruler  of  the  feast  was  chosen  by throwing  the  dice.  Thus  Horace,  in  his  ode  to  his  friend Sestius,  says,  moralizing  on  the  brevity  of  life :  *^  Soon  the home  of  Pluto  will  be  thine,  nor  wilt  thou  cast  lots  with  the dice  for  the  presidency  over  the  wine.\"  He  prescribed  the Vol.  IL— «   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   82  WOBD  STUDIES  IN  THB  NEW  TESTAMENT.  proportions  of  wine  and  water,  and  could  also  impose  fines  for failures  to  gness  riddles,  etc  As  the  success  of  the  feast  de- pended largely  upon  him,  his  selection  was  a  matter  of  some delicacy.  Plato  says,  ^^  Must  we  not  appoint  a  sober  man  and a  wise  to  be  our  master  of  the  revels  ?  For  if  the  ruler  of drinkers  be  himself  young  and  drunken,  and  not  over-wise,  only by  some  special  good  fortune  will  he  be  saved  from  doing  some great  evil  '*  (\"  Laws,\"  640).

V.  and  Tynd.  are  better  than  the  Eev.,  wh^n 7nen  hcuos  d/nmk  fredy.  The  ruler  of  the  feast  means  that when  the  palates  of  the  guests  have  become  less  sensitive through  indulgence,  an  inferior  quality  of  wine  is  offered.  In every  instance  of  its  use  in  the  New  Testament  the  word means  intoxication.  The  attempt  of  the  advocates  of  the  unfer- mented-wine  theory  to  deny  or  weaken  this  sense  by  citing  Mtf v)dlrV)aiered  ga/rden  (Isa.  Iviii.  11 ;  Jer.  xxxi  12)  scarcely  re- quires comment.  One  might  answer  by  quoting  Plato,  who uses  pairrC^ea^iUf  to  he  hapHzed^  for  being  drunk  (\"  Sympo- sium,*'  176).  In  the  Septuagint  th^  verb  repeatedly  occurs  for toatering  (Ps.  Ixv.  9, 10),  but  always  with  the  sense  of  drench^ mff  or  soaking;  of  being  drunken  or  surfeited  with  water.  In Jer.  xlviii.  (Sept.  xxxi.)  26,  it  is  found  in  the  literal  sense,  to he  drunken.  The  metaphorical  use  of  the  word  has  passed  into common  slang,  as  when  a  drunken  man  is  said  to  be  wetted  or soaked  (so  Plato,  above).  The  figurative  use  of  the  word  in  the Septuagint  has  a  parallel  in  the  use  of  irorl^m,  to  give  to  drinkj to  express  the  watering  of  ground.  So  Gten.  ii.  6,  a  mist watered  the  face  of  the  earth,  or  gave  it  drink.  Compai*e  Gen. xiii.  10 ;  Dent.  xi.  10.  A  curious  use  of  the  word  occurs  in Homer,  where  he  is  describing  the  stretching  of  a  bull's  hide, which,  in  order  to  make  it  more  elastic,  is  soaked  {jiel^vouaav) with  fat  (\"  Hiad,\"  xvii.,  390).

The  same hint  underlies  the  words  in  ver.  6,  *'  after  the  Jews'  manner of  purifying.\"  Only  John  mentions  this  earliest  passover  of Christ's  ministry.  The  Synoptists  relate  no  incident  of  his ministry  in  Judssa,  and  but  for  the  narrative  of  John,  it  could not  be  positively  asserted  that  Jesus  went  up  to  tferusalem  dur- ing His  public  life  until  the  time  of  His  arrest  and  crucifixion.  14.

Matthew  and  Mark  use  teoKr Xufiumiii  (see  ver.  16),  of  which  the  ineanmg  is  substantially the  same  so  far  as  regards  the  dealing  in  email  coin  ;  bat  with the  difference  that  fcoXKufio^,  the  noun  from  which  it  is  derived, and  meaning  a  email  oawij  is  also  used  to  denote  the  rate  of  ex- change. This  latter  word  therefore  gives  a  hint  of  the  jpremi- i$m  on  exchange,  which  John's  word  here  does  not  convey. The  money-changers  opened  their  staUs  in  the  country  towns  a month  before  the  feast.  By  the  time  of  the  first  arrivals  of passover-pilgrims  at  Jerusalem,  the  country  stalls  were  closed, and  the  money-changers  sat  in  the  temple  (see  on  Matt.  xvii. 24 ;  xxi.  12 ;  Mark  xi.  15).  John's  picture  of  this  incident  is more  graphic  and  detailed  than  those  of  the  Synoptists,  who merely  state  summarily  the  driving  out  of  the  traders  and  the overthrow  of  the  tables.

John  describes  the  Lord's  knowl- ^ge  hy  two  words  which  it  is  important  to  distinguish. TuwHTKeof,  as  here,  implies  acquired  knowlege ;  knowledge  which is  the  result  of  discernment  and  which  may  be  enlarged.  This knowledge  may  be  drawn  from  external  facts  (v.  6  ;  vL  15)  or from  spiritual  sympathy  (x.  14,  27 ;  xvii.  25).  ElBevai  (L  26) implies  absolute  knowledge :  the  knowledge  of  intuition  and  of satisfied  conviction.  Hence  it  is  used  of  Christ's  knowledge  of divine  things  (iii.  11 ;  v.  32  ;  vii.  29),  of  the  facts  of  His  own being  (vi.  6  ;  viiL  14 ;  xiiL  1),  and  of  external  facts  (vL  61,  64 ; xiii.  11).  In  XXL  17  the  two  words  appear  together.  Peter  says to  Jesus,  appealing  to  His  absohUe  knowledge,  ^^  Thou  knawest (oZSo?)  idl  things : \"  appealing  to  his  discernmenty  '^  Thou  hfuyuh est  ovperoeioeet  {yiiniaKei^)  that  I  love  Thee.\"  26.

V.   his comment entire: “In favor of this allegorical interpreta- tion it is urged that there are other occurrences of Babylon in the New Testament as a mystical name for Rome (Apoc. xiv. 8; xviii. 2, 10); that it is in the highest degree unlikely that Peter should have made the Assyrian Babylon his residence or missionary centre, especially in view of a statement by Josephus indicating that the Emperor Claudius had expelled the Jews from that city and neighborhood ; and that tradition connects Peter with Rome, but not with Babylon. The fact, however, that the word is mystically used in a mystical book like the Apocalypse—a book, too, which is steeped in the spirit and ter- minology of the Old Testament—is no argument for the mysti- cal use of the word in writings of a different type. The alle- gorical interpretation becomes still less likely when it is observed that other geographical designations in this epistle (ch. i. 1) have undoubtedly the literal meaning. The tradition itself, too, is uncertain. The statement in Josephus does not bear all that it is made to bear. There is no reason to suppose that, at the time when this epistle was written, the city of Rome was cur- rently known among Christians as Babylon. On the contrary, wherever it is mentioned in the New Testament, with the sin- gle exception of the Apocalypse (and even there it is distin- guished as ‘ Babylon, the great’), it gets its usual name, Rome. So far, too, from the Assyrian Babylon being practically in a deserted state at this date, there is very good ground for believ- ing that the Jewish population (not to speak of the heathen) of the city and vicinity was very considerable. For these and other reasons a succession of distinguished interpreters and his- torians, from Erasmus and Calvin, on to Neander, Weiss, Reuss, Huther, etc., have rightly held by the literal sense.”   Marcus. Rev., Mark. John Mark, the author of the gos- pel. See Introduction to Mark, on his relations to Peter.   My son.

CHAPTER TI.   1. Simon Peter. Note the addition of Simon, and see on 1 Pet.i.1. The best-attested orthography is Symeon, which is the form of his name in Acts xv. 14, where the account probably came from him. This also is the Hebraic form of the name found in the Septuagint, Gen. xxix. 33, and elsewhere. Compare Apoc. vii. 7; Luke ii. 25, 34; i. 30; Acts xii. 1. The combined name, Simon Peter, is found Luke v. 8; John xiii. 6; xx.2; xxi. 15, and elsewhere, though in these instances it is given as Simon; Symeon occurring only in Acts xv. 14. While his name is given with greater familiarity than in the first epistle, his official title, servant and apostle, is fuller. This combination, servant and apostle, occurs in no other apostolic salutation. The nearest approach to it is Tit. i. 1.   Of Jesus Christ. The word Christ never occurs in the second epistle without Jesus ; and only in this instance without some predicate, such as Lord, Saviour.   To them that have obtained (rots Aayotow). Lit., ob- tained by lot. So Luke i.9; John xix. 24. In the sense which it has here it is used by Peter (Actsi. 17) of Judas, who had obtained part of this ministry. In this sense it occurs only in that passage and here.   676 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. I.   Like precious (/cdtuuov). Only here in New Testament.

Most probably the Jewish Christians, of whom Peter was one.

Our Lord (xvpiov jyov). The word Zord in the second epistle is always used of God, unless Chrzst or Saviour is added.   3. Hath granted (dedwpnuévns). This is the only word which Peter and Mark alone have in common in the New Tes- tament; a somewhat singular fact in view of their intimate relations, and of the impress of Peter upon Mark’s gospel: yet it tells very strongly against the theory of a forgery of this epistle. The word is stronger than the simple diSwpu, to give, meaning to grant or bestow as a gift. Compare Mark xv. 45.   Godliness (evcéBevav). Used only by Peter (Acts iii. 12), and in the Pastoral Epistles. It is from ed, well, and céBopat, to worshap, so that the radical idea is worship rightly directed. Worship, however, is to be understood satesloeaalolosinnkcate I worth-ship, or reverence paid to worth, whether in God or man. So Wycliffe’s rendering of Matt. vi. 2, “ that they be wor-   shipped of men;” and “worship thy father and thy mother,” Matt. xix. 19. In classical Greek the word is not confined to   Cu. 1] THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 677   religion, but means also prety in the fulfilment of human rela- tions, like the Latin pietas. Even in classical Greek, however, it is a standing word for prety in the religious sense, showing itself in right reverence; and is opposed to dvocéBeta, wn- godliness, and avons, profaneness. “The recognition of dependence upon the gods, the confession of human depend- ence, the tribute of homage which man renders in the certainty that he needs their favor—all this is edcéSeca, manifest in con- duct and conversation, in sacrifice and prayer” (Niagelsbach, cited by Cremer). This definition may be almost literally trans- ferred to the Christian word. It embraces the confession of the one living and true God, and life corresponding to this knowledge. See on ver. 2.

His own (idéa). Of frequent occurrence in Peter, and not necessarily with an emphatic force, since the adjective is some- times used merely as a possessive pronoun, and mostly so in Peter (1 Pet. iii. 1, 5; 2 Pet. ii. 16, 22, etc.).   Virtue. See on 1 Pet. ii. 9. Used by Peter only, with the exception of Philip. iv. 8. The original classical sense of the word had no special moral import, but denoted excellence of any kind—bravery, rank, nobility ; also, excellence of land, ani- mals, things, classes of persons. Paul seems to avoid the term, using it only once.  On glory and virtue Bengel says, “the former indicates his natural, the latter his moral, attributes.”   4. Whereby (6? dv).

Rev., his ex- ceeding great, etc., by way of rendering the definite article, ra.   Precious (risa). The word occurs fourteen times in the New Testament. In eight instances it is used of material things, as stones, fruit, wood. In Peter it occurs three times: 1 Pet.1. 7, of tried faith; 1 Pet. 1.19, of the blood of Christ ; and here, of God’s promises.   Promises (ézrayyéAuata). Only in this epistle. In classical Greek the distinction is made between ézayyéApata, promises voluntarily or spontaneously made, and trocyéoes, promises made in response to a petition.

Having escaped (azroguyovres). Only in this epistle. To escape by flight.   Through lust (év éi9uuia). Rev. renders by lust, as the instrument of the corruption. Others, zn lust, as the sphere of the corruption, or as that in which it is grounded.   5. Beside this (avt0 rodro). Wrong. Render, for this very cause, as Rev. Lit., thes very thing. Just as rl, what? has come to mean why? So the strengthened demonstrative ac- quires the meaning of wherefore, for this very cause.   Giving all diligence (c7ovdnv wacay trapewevéyxavtes). The verb occurs only here in New Testament, and means, liter-   Cu. I.] THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 679   ally, to bring in by the side of: adding your diligence to the divine promises. So Rev., adding on your part.   Add to your faith, etc. The A.V. is entirely wrong. The verb rendered add (émuxopnyjcate) is derived from yopos, a chorus, such as was employed in the representation of the Greek tragedies. The verb originally means to bear the expense of a chorus, which was done by a person selected by the state, who was obliged to defray all the expenses of training and mainten- ance. In the New Testament the word has lost this technical sense, and is used in the general sense of supplying or provid- ing. The verb is used by Paul (2 Cor. ix. 10; Gal. iii. 5; Col. ii. 19), and is rendered minister (A. V.), supply (Rev.); and the simple verb yopnyéw, minister, occurs 1 Pet. iv. 11; 2 Cor. ix. 10. Here the Rev., properly, renders supply.   To your faith (év 79 lores). The A. V. exhorts to add one virtue to another; but the Greek, to develop one virtue i the eaercise of another: “an increase by growth, not by external junction; each new grace springing out of, attempting, and perfecting the other.” Render, therefore, as Rev. In your faith supply virtue, and in your virtue knowledge, etc.   Virtue. See on ver. 3, and 1 Pet. ii. 9. Not in the sense of moral excellence, but of the energy which Christians are to exhibit, as God exerts his energy upon them. As God calls us by his own virtue (ver. 3), so Christians are to exhibit virtue or energy in the exercise of their faith, translating it into vigorous action.   6. Temperance (éyxpare/a). Self-control ; holding the pas- sions and desires in hand. See 1 Cor. ix. 25.   Patience (i7opovjv). Lit., remaining behind or staying, from pévea, to wait. Not merely endurance of the inevitable, for Christ could have relieved himself of his sufferings (Ileb. xii. 2, 3; compare Matt. xxvi. 53); but the heroic, brave patience with which a Christian not only bears but contends.   680 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. L   Speaking of Christ’s patience, Barrow remarks, ‘“‘ Neither was it out of a stupid insensibility or stubborn resolution that he did thus behave himself; for he had a most vigorous sense of all those grievances, and a strong (natural) aversation from under- going them; . . . but from a perfect submission to the divine will, and entire command over his passions, an excessive charity toward mankind, this patient and meek behavior did spring.” The same writer defines patience as follows: ‘“ That virtue which qualifieth us to bear all conditions and all events, by God’s disposal incident to us, with such apprehensions and persuasions of mind, such dispositions and affections of heart, such external deportment and practices of life as God requireth and good reason directeth (Sermon XLIL., “On Patience ”).   Godliness. See onver. 3. The quality is never ascribed to God.   Brotherly kindness (¢:Aadergpiav). Rev. renders, literally, love of the brethren.   Charity (aydmnv). There seems at first an infelicity in the rendering of the Rev., an your love of the brethren love. But this is only apparent. In the former word Peter contem- plates Christian fellow-believers as naturally and properly hold- ing the first place in our affections (compare Gal. vi. 10, “ Especrally unto them which are of the household of faith”). But he follows this with the broader affection which should characterize Christians, and which Paul lauds in 1 Cor. xiii., the love of men as men. It may be remarked here that the entire rejection by the Rev. of charity as the rendering of dydrn is wholesome and defensible. Charity has acquired two peculiar meanings, both of which are indeed included or implied in Jove, but neither of which expresses more than a single phase of love —tolerance and beneficence. The A. V. in the great majority of cases translates dove; always in the Gospels, and mostly else- where. Thereis no more reason for saying “ charity suffereth long,” than for saying, “the chartty of God is shed abroad in our hearts,” or “ God is charity.”   Cu.

Rev., are yours; following the sense of possesston which legitimately belongs to the verb; as Matt. xix. 21, that thow hast; 1 Cor. xiii. 3, goods. In the sense of beng the verb is stronger than the simple eivaz, to be ; denoting being which is from the beginning, and therefore attaching to a person as a proper characteristic; something be- longing to him, and so running into the idea of rightful posses- sion as above.   Barren (dpyovs). From a, not, and épyov, work. Hence, more correctly, as Rev., zdle. Compare “dle word” (Matt. xii. 36); “standing zdle” (Matt. xx. 3, 6); also, 1 Tim. v. 13. The tautology, barren and unfruitful, is thus avoided.   In the knowledge (eis). Rev., more correctly, wnto. The idea is not idleness in the knowledge, but idleness in pressing on and developing toward and finally reaching the knowledge. With this agrees the compound ésiyvwour, the constantly m- creasing and finally full knowledge.   9. But (yap). Wrong. Render as Rev., for.   He that lacketh these things (6 wi) mdpeotw Taira). Lit., to whom these things are not present. Note that a different word is used here from that in ver. 8, ave yours, to convey the idea of possession. Instead of speaking of the gifts as belong- ing to the Christian by habitual, settled possession, he denotes them now as merely present with him.   Blind (rugdAds). Illustrating Peter’s emphasis on sight as a medium of instruction. See Introduction.   And cannot see afar off (uvordfwv). Only here in New Testament. From pita, to close, and dp, the eye.

V., when T call to remembrance: Rev., having been reminded of. Some expositors find in the expression a suggestion of a voluntary acceptunce of a darkened condition. This is doubtful, however. Lumby thinks that it marks the advanced years of the writer, since he adds to failure of sight the failure of memory, that fac- ulty on which the aged dwell more than on sight.

Professor Salmond observes that it is the reverse of “‘ saved, yet so as by fire ” (1 Cor. iii. 15).   Everlasting kingdom (ai@vov Bacirelav). In the first epis- tle, Peter designated the believer’s future as an inheritance ; here he calls it a kingdom. Hternal, as Rev., is better than everlastong, since the word includes more than duration of time.   Cu. L] THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 683   12. I will not be negligent. The A.

The better read- ing, however, is wedAAnow, J intend, or, as often in classical Greek, with a sense of certainty—I shall be sure, which Rev. adopts, rendering J shall be ready. The formula occurs in but one other passage, Matt. xxiv. 6, where it is translated by the simple future, ye shall hear, with an implied sense, as ye surely wil hear.   Ye know (eidoras). Lit., knowing. Compare 1 Pet. i. 18.   Established (éornpryyévous). See on 1 Pet. v.10. Perhaps the exhortation, “ strengthen thy brethren,” may account for his repeated use of this word and its derivatives. Thus, unstable (aarnpixtot) ; steadfastness (atnpryod), 2 Pet. iii. 16, 17.   In the present truth (ev 77 mapotcn ddndeia). Le., the truth which is present with you through the instruction of your teachers ; not the truth at present under consideration. See on ver. 9; and compare the same phrase in Col. i. 6, rendered, 2s come unto you.   13. Tabernacle (cxnvepate). A figurative expression for the body, used also by Paul, 2 Cor. v. 1, 4, though he employs the shorter kindred word oxjvos. Peter also has the same mixture of metaphors which Paul employs in that passage, viz., building and clothing. See next verse. Peter’s use of taber- nacle is significant in connection with his words at the trans- figuration, “Let us make three tabernacles (Matt. xvii. 4). The word, as well as the entire phrase, carries the idea of brief duration—a frail tent, erected for a night. Compare ver. 14.   To stir you up by putting you in remembrance (ée- yetpew buds év vrropvncer). Lit., to stir you up in reminding. See the same phrase in ch. iii. 1.   14.

Rev., the putting off of my taber- nacle cometh swiftly. Possibly in allusion to his advanced age. Putting off is a metaphor, from putting off a garment. So Paul, 2 Cor. v. 3,4, being clothed, wnclothed, clothed upon. The word occurs, also, 1 Pet. iii. 21, and is used by Peter only. Cometh swiftly, implying the speedy approach of death ; though others understand it of the quick, violent death which Christ prophesied he should die. ‘Even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me.” See John xxi. 18,19. Compare, also, John xiii. 36, and note the word follow in both passages. “ Peter had now learnt the full force of Christ’s sayings, and to what end the following of Jesus was to bring him ” (Lumby).   Hath shewed (éd7A@cev). But the tense is the aorist, point- ing back to a definite act at a past time (John xxi.18). Hence, shewed me, or, as Rev., signified. Compare 1 Pet. i. 11, did   signify.   15. Ye may be able (éyew tas). Lit., that you may have at. A similar use of have, in the sense of to be able, occurs Mark xiv. 8. The same meaning is also foreshadowed in Matt. xviii. 25, had not to pay ; and John viii. 6, have to accuse.   Decease (éo0d0v). Hxodus is a literal transcript of the word, and is the term used by Luke in his account of the transfigura- tion. ‘ They spake of his decease.” It occurs only once else- where, Heb. xi. 22, in the literal sense, the departing or exodus of the children of Israel. “It is at least remarkable,” says Dean Alford, “that, with the recollection of the scene on the mount of transfiguration floating in his mind, the apostle should use so close together the words which were there also associated, tabernacle and decease. The coincidence should not be for- gotten in treating of the question of the genuineness of the epistle.”   Call to remembrance (uvjunv croveto Sar). The phrase oc- curs nowhere else in the New Testament. In classical Greek, to make mention of. An analogous expression is found, Rom. i.   Ca. 1.)

It is scarcely necessary to notice Davidson’s remark that this expression points to a time when superstitious reverence for places had sprung up in Palestine. “ Of all places to which special sanctity would be ascribed by Christ’s follow- ers, surely that would be the first to be so marked where the most solemn testimony was given to the divinity of Jesus. To the Jewish Christian this would rank with Sinai, and no name would be more fitly applied to it than that which had so con- stantly been given to a place on which God first revealed him- self in his glory. The ‘holy mount of God’ (Ezek. xxvii. 14) would now receive another application, and he would see little of the true continuity of God’s revelation who did not connect readily the old and the new covenants, and give to the place where the glory of Christ was most eminently shown forth the same name which was applied so oft to Sinai” (Lumby).   19. We have also a more sure word of prophecy (xai éyouev BeBarorepov Tov rpodytixov Noyov). The A.

We may explain either (a) as Rev., we have the word of prophecy made more sure, i.e., we are better certified than before as to the prophetic word by reason of this voice; or (0) we have the word of prophecy as a surer confirmation of God’s truth than what we ourselves saw, 2.¢., Old-Testament testi- mony is more convincing than even the voice heard at the transfiguration. The latter seems to accord better with the words which follow. ‘To appreciate this we must put our- selves somewhat in the place of those for whom St. Peter wrote.

Therefore we can readily understand how the long line of prophetic scriptures, fulfilled in so many ways in the life of Jesus, would be a mightier form of evidence than the narrative of one single event in Peter’s life” (Lumby). “Peter knew a sounder basis for faith than that of signs and wonders. He had seen our Lord Jesus Christ receive honor and glory from God the Father in the holy mount; he had been dazzled and carried out of himself by visions and voices from heaven ; but, nevertheless, even when his memory and heart are throbbing with recollections of that sublime scene, he says, ‘we have something surer still in the prophetic word” . . . It was not the miracles of Christ by which he came to know Jesus, but the word of Christ as interpreted by the spirit of Christ” (Sam- uel Cox).   Unto a light (Avyvw). More correctly, as Rev., a damp.   In a dark place (év advyynpe tor). A peculiar expression. Lit., a dry place. Only here in New Testament. Rev. gives squalid, in margin. Aristotle opposes it to bright or glistering. It is a subtle association of the idea of darkness with squalor, dryness, and general neglect.   Dawn (Svavydon). Only here in New Testament. Compare the different word in Matt. xxviii. 1, and Luke xxiii. 54, ésr- gockeo. The verb is compounded of did, through, and avyn, sunlight, thus carrying the picture of light breaking through the- gloom.   688 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. IL.

The kindred adjective occurs Gal. ii. 4, “false brethren privily brought in” (aapevcdxtovs). The metaphor is of spzes or tractors introducing themselves into an enemy’s camp. Compare Jude 4, crept in unawares. The verb means, literally, to bring (a@yew) into (eis) by the side of (apa).   Damnable heresies (aipécess amwnelas). Lit., heresres of destruction. Rev., destructive heresies. Heresy is a transcript of aipeocs, the primary meaning of which is chovce; so that a heresy is, strictly, the choice of an opinion contrary to that usually received; thence transferred to the body of those who profess such opinions, and therefore a sect. So Reyv., in margin, sects of perdition. Commonly in this sense in the New Testa- ment (Acts v.17; xv.53; xxviii. 22), though the Rev. has an odd variety in its marginal renderings. See Acts. xxiv. 14; 1 Cor. xi. 19; Gal. v.20. The rendering heretical doctrines seems to agree better with the context; false teachers bringing in sects is awkward.   Denying. A significant word from Peter.   The Lord (Sec7d7nv). In most cases in the New Testament the word is rendered master, the Rev. changing lord to master in every case but two—Luke ii. 29; Acts iv. 24; and in both in- stances putting master in margin, and reserving lord for the rendering of «vpsos. In three of these instances the word is used in direct address to God; and it may be asked why the Rev. changes Lord to Master in the text of Apoc. vi. 10, and re- tains Lord in Luke ii. 29; Acts iv. 24. In five out of the ten occurrences of the word in the New Testament it means master of the household. Originally, it indicates absolute, unrestricted authority, so that the Greeks refused the title to any but the gods. In the New Testament deomdrns and xvpios are used in- terchangeably of God, and of masters of servants. ",

Compare 1 Pet. iii. 20.   A preacher («ypuxa). Lit., a herald. Compare the kin- dred verb knptoce, to preach, everywhere in New Testament. The word herald is beautifully suggestive, at many points, of the office of a gospel minister. In the Homeric age the herald partook of the character of an ambassador. He summoned the assembly and kept order in it, and had charge of arrangements at sacrifices and festivals. The office of the heralds was sacred, and their persons inviolable ; hence they were employed to bear messages between enemies. The symbol of their office was the herald’s staff, or caduceus, borne by Mercury, the herald-god. This was originally an olive-branch with fillets, which were afterward formed into snakes, according to the legend that Mercury found two snakes fighting and separated them with his wand, from which circumstance they were used as an emblem of peace. Plato (“ Laws,” xii., 941) thus speaks of the fidelity   Cu. IL} THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 693   entailed by the office: “If any herald or ambassador carry a false message to any other city, or bring back a false message from the city to which he is sent, or be proved to have brought back, whether from friends or enemies, in his capacity of herald or ambassador, what they have never said—let him be indicted for having offended, contrary to the law, in the sacred office and appointment of Hermes and Zeus, and let there be a pen- alty fixed which he shall suffer or pay if he be convicted.” In later times, their position as messengers between nations at war wasemphasized. In Herodotus (i., 21), the word herald is used as synonymous with apostle. ‘“ Alyattes sent a herald (xnpuxa) to Miletus in hopes of concluding a truce, etc. The herald (aréaronos) went on his way to Miletus.” A priestly house at Athens bore the name of «ypuxes, heralds.   Bringing in (érd£as). The verb may be said to be used by Peter only. Besides this passage and ver. 1, it occurs only at Acts vy. 28, where Luke probably received the account from Peter as the principal actor: “ye intend to bring upon us (érrayaryeiv) this man’s blood.”   6. Turning into ashes (redpdcas). Only here in New Testament.   Having made them an example (iddeypa TEJELKOS). Compare 1 Pet. ii. 21.

An un- common word in the New Testament. Luke viii. 47; Acts ix.G:   Dignities (Sofas). Lit., glories. Compare Jude 8. Prob- ably angelic powers: note the reference to the angels imme- diately following, as in Jude 9 to Michael. They defy the spiritual powers though knowing their might.   11. Power and might (doyvi cai duvdper). Rev., might and power. The radical idea of toys, might, is that of indwelling strength, especially as embodied : might which inheres in phys- ical powers organized and working under individual direction, as an army: which appears in the resistance of physical organ- isms, as the earth, against which one dashes himself in vain: which dwells in persons or things, and gives them influence or value: which resides in laws or punishments to make them irre- sistible. This sense comes out clearly in the New Testament in the use of the word and of its cognates. Thus, “ Love the Lord thy God with all thy strength” (Mark xii. 30): “accord- ing to the working of his mighty power” (Eph. i. 19). So the kindred adjective loyupds. “A strong man” (Matt. xii. 29): a mighty famine (Luke xv. 14): his letters are powerful (2 Cor. x. 10): a strong consolation (Heb. vi. 18): a maghty angel (Apoe. xviii. 21). Also the verb isxvo. “It is good for noth- ing” (Matt. v.13): “shall not be able” (Luke xiii. 24): “I can do all things” (Philip. iv. 18): “availeth much” (Jas. v. 16).  Abvapus is rather ability, faculty : not necessarily manifest, as icyvs: power residing in one by nature. Thus ability (Matt. xxv. 15): virtue (Mark v. 30): power (Luke xxiv. 29; Acts i. 8; 1 Cor. ii. 4): “ strength of sin” (1 Cor. xv. 56). So of moral vigor. “Strengthened with might in the imner man” (Eph.   696 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IL   iii. 16): “with all méght (Col. i. 11). It is, however, mostly power % action, as in the frequent use of duvdpers for miracles, mighty works, they being exhibitions of divine virtue. Thus “power unto salvation ” (Rom. i. 16): the kingdom coming zn power” (Mark ix. 1): God himself called power—* the right hand of the power” (Matt. xxvi. 64), and so in classical Greek used to denote the magistrates or authorities. Also of the angelic powers (Eph. i. 21; Rom. viii. 38 ; 1 Pet. iii. 22). Gen- erally, then, it may be said that while both words include the idea of manifestation or of power in action, ‘oxvs emphasizes the outward, physical manifestations, and dvvapus the enward, spiritual or moral virtue. Plato (“ Protagoras,” 350) draws the distinction thus: “I should not have admitted that the able (Suvarovs) are strong (iaxvpods), though I have admitted that the strong are able. For there is a difference between abzlety (Sdvamwv) and strength (tcxvv). The former is given by knowl- edge as well as by madness or rage; but strength comes from nature and a healthy state of the body. Aristotle (“ Rhet.,” i., 5) says “ strength (ioxds) is the power of moving another as one wills; and that other is to be moved either by drawing or push- ing or carrying or pressing or compressing; so that the strong (6 toyupos) is strong for all or for some of these things.”   Railing judgment. Compare Jude 9; Zech. iii. 1, 2.   12. As natural brute beasts made to be taken and de- stroyed. This massing of epithets is characteristic of Peter. Natural (pvorxa), Rev., mere animals, should be construed with made, or as Rev., born (yeyevvnuéva). Brute (aroya), lit., unreasoning or irrational. Rev., without reason. Compare Acts xxv. 27. Beasts (f@a). Lit., wing creatures, from fda, to live. More general and inclusive than beasts, since it denotes strictly all creatures that live, including man. Plato even ap- plies it to God himself. Hence Rev., properly, creatures. To be taken and destroyed (eis Ghoow kal d3opav). Lit., for capture and destruction. Destruction twice in this verse, and with a cognate verb. Render the whole, as Rev., But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed.   Cx. 123 THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 697   Speak evil (@racdnuodvres). Participle. Rev., rightly, raz wg. Compare vv. 10, 11.   And shall utterly perish in their own corruption (év 77 bIopa avtav Kail PIapyjcovra). ‘There isa play upon the words, which the Rey. reproduces by rendering, “ shall in their destroy- ing surely be destroyed.” The and, which in the A. V. connects this and the preceding sentence, is rather to be taken with shadd be destroyed, as emphasizing it, and should be rendered, as Rev., surely, or as others, even or also. Compare on the whole verse Jude 10.   13. And shall receive (cousodpevor). Lit., being about or destined to receive. See on 1 Pet. i. 9, and compare 1 Pet. v. 4. Some good texts read doduxovpevor, suffering wrong. So Rev., suffering wrong as the hire of wrong-doing.   Reward of unrighteousness (usc9ov abdixias). Mics is hire, and so is rendered in Rey. Compare Matt. xx. 8; Luke x. 7; John iv. 36. It also has in classical Greek the general sense of reward, and so very often in the New Testament, in passages where hire or wages would be inappropriate. Thus Matt. v.12; vi. 1; x.41. Hire would seem to be better here, because of the reference to Balaam in ver. 15, where the word occurs again and requires that rendering. The phrase prodds abixias, reward or wages of iniquity, occurs only here and in Peter’s speech concerning Judas (Acts i. 18), where the Rev. retains the rendering of the A. V., reward of iniquity. It would have been better to render wages of imiguity in both places. Iniquity and unrighteousness are used in English almost synonymously ; though, etymologically, oequity empha- sizes the idea of injustice (inaequus), while unrighteousness (non-rightness) is more general, implying al deviation from right, whether involving another’s interests or not. This dis- tinction is not, however, observed in the Rev., where the render- ing of adcxia, and of the kindred adjective sien varies unac- countably, if not capriciously, between unrighteous and wnjust.   698 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IL   As they that count it pleasure to riot (jSovjy syovpevor tpudiv). The as of the A.V. is needless. The discourse pro- ceeds from ver. 18 by a series of participles, as far as following (ver. 15). Literally the passage runs, cownting riot a pleasure.   Riot (rpud7jv). Meaning rather daintiness, delicacy, lwau- riousness. Even the Rev. revel is almost too strong. Compare Luke vii. 25, the only other passage where the word occurs, and where the Rev. retains the A. V., live delicately. So, also, Rev. substitutes, in Jas. v. 5, lived delicately for lived in pleasure.   In the daytime. Compare Peter’s words Acts ii. 15; also, 1 Thess. v. 7.   Spots (o7/Ao1). Only here and Eph. v. 27. Compare the kindred participle spotted (Jude 23), and defileth (Jas. ili. 6).   Blemishes (wapor). Only here in New Testament.

With their own deceivings (év tals amdtais avtav). The Rey., however, follows another reading, which occurs in the parallel passage Jude 12: aydraus, love-feasts, the public ban- quets instituted by the early Christians, and connected with the celebration of the Lord’s Supper. Rev. renders revelling in their love-feasts, though the American Committee insist on de- ceivings. On the abuses at these feasts, see 1 Cor. xi. 20-22. For avrév, their own, the best texts read adrav, their.   While they feast with you (cuvevwyovpevor). The word originally conveys the idea of swmptuous feasting, and is ap- propriate in view of the fact to which Peter alludes, that these sensualists converted the love-feast into a revel. Compare Paul’s words, 1 Cor. xi. 21, “one is hungry and another   Cx. IL] THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 699   drunken.” This seems to favor the reading aydrais.

Ass (irroftyov). Lit., beast of burden. An animal subjected to the yoke. From t76, beneath, and fuyov, a yoke. See on Matt xxi. 5.   Speaking (gIeyEduevov). The verb is found in Peter only, here and ver. 18, and in Acts iv. 18, a Petrine narrative. It is well chosen, however. The verb denotes the utterance of a sound or voice, not only by man, but by any animal having lungs. Hence, not only of men’s articulate cries, such as a battle-shout, but of the neigh of the horse, the scream of the eagle, the croak of the raven. It is also applied to sounds made by inanimate things, such as thunder, a trumpet, a lyre, the ring of an earthen vessel, showing whether it is cracked or not. Schmidt (‘“Synonymik”) says that it does not indicate any physical capability on the part of the man, but describes the sound only from the hearer’s stand-point. In view of this general sense of the verb, the propriety is apparent of the de- fining phrase, with man’s voice.   Cu. IL] THE SECOND GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. TOL   Forbad (éx@dvcev).

The word occurs only twice elsewhere—Mark iv. 37; Luke vii. 23— in the parallel accounts of the storm on the lake, which Jesus calmed by his word. There on the lake Peter was at home, as well as with the Lord on that occasion; and the peculiar word describing a whirlwind—one of those sudden storms so frequent on that lake (see note on the word, Mark iv. 37)—would be the first to occur to him.

There  are  doubt- less passages  which  bear  out  this  distinction  (see  on  J.  ii.  24), but  it  is  impossible  to  carry  it  rigidly  through  the  N.  T.  In the  two  classes,  —  those  who  know  not  God  and  those  who obey  not  the  gospel,  —  it  is  not  probable  that  Paul  has  in mind  a  distinction  between  Jews  and  Gentiles.  The  Jews were  not  ignorant  of  God,  yet  they  are  described  by  John  as not  knowing  him.  The  Gentiles  are  described  by  Paul  as knowing  God,  but  as  refusing  to  glorify  him  as  God  (Rom. i.  21).  Paul  rather  describes  here  the  subjects  of  God's judgment  as  one  class,  but  under  different  aspects.  9.  Shall  be  punished  {hUrivrUrovtnv).  The  verb  (N.

Additional  Note  on  S\\£0pov  alAviov  eternal  destruction,  2  Th.  I.  9.  'Autfv,  transliterated  aeony  is  a  period  of  time  of  longer  or  shorter  dura- tion, haying  a  beginning  and  an  end,  and  complete  in  itself.  Aristotle (ircpt  ovpavwi  i.  9, 15)  says :  \"  The  period  which  includes  the  whole  time of  each  one's  life  is  called  the  aeon  of  each  one.\"  Hence  it  often  means the  life  of  a  man,  as  in  Homer,  where  one's  life  (ahav)  is  said  to  leave  him or  to  consume  away  (77.  v.  685;  Od,  ▼.  160).  It  is  not,  however,  limited to  human  life;  it  signifies  any  period  in  the  course  of  events,  as  the period  or  age  before  Christ;  the  period  of  the  millennium;  the  mytho- logical period  before  the  beginnings  of  history.  The  word  has  not  **  a stationary  and  mechanical  value \"  (De  Quincey).  It  does  not  mean  a period  of  a  fixed  length  for  all  cases.  There  are  as  many  aeons  as  entities, the  respective  durations  of  which  are  fixed  by  the  normal  conditions  of the  several  entities.  There  is  one  aeon  of  a  human  life,  another  of  the life  of  a  nation,  another  of  a  crow's  life,  another  of  an  oak's  life.  The length  of  the  aeon  depends  on  the  subject  to  which  it  is  attached.  •  As  Llghtfoot  on  Philip,  ii.  0.   Gh.  I.]      THE  SECOND  EPISTLE  TO  THE  THES8ALOKIANS.      69  It  is  sometimes  translated  w&rld;  world  representing  a  period  or  a series  of  periods  of  time.  See  Matt.  xii.  82 ;  xiii.  40,  49 ;  L.  i.  70 ;  1  Cor. L  20;  ii.  6;  Eph.  L  21.  Similarly  oL  aJwn^  the  worlds^  the  uniyerse,  the aggregate  of  the  ages  or  periods,  and  their  contents  which  are  included in  the  duration  of  the  world.    1  Cor.  iL  7 ;  x.  11 ;  Heb.  i.  2 ;  iz.  26 ;  xi.  3.  The  word  always  carries  the  notion  of  time^  and  not  of  eternity.  It always  means  a  period  of  time.  Otherwise  it  would  be  impossible  to account  for  the  plural,  or  for  such  qualifying  expressions  as  this  age,  or the  age  to  come.  It  does  not  mean  something  endless  or  everlasting.  To deduce  that  meaning  from  its  relation  to  det  is  absurd ;  for,  apart  from the  fact  that  the  meaning  of  a  word  is  not  definitely  fixed  by  its  deriya- iion,  dci  does  not  signify  endless  duration.  When  the  writer  of  the  Pastoral Epistles  quotes  the  saying  that  the  Cretans  are  always  (dci)  liars  (Tit.  L 12),  he  surely  does  not  mean  that  the  Cretans  will  go  on  lying  to  all eternity.  See  also  Acts  yii.  51 ;  2  Cor.  iy.  11 ;  yi  10 ;  Heb.  iii.  10 ;  1.  Pet iiL  15.  'Ac4  means  habitually  or  continually  within  the  limit  of  the  subject's life.  In  our  colloquial  dialect  everlastingly  is  used  in  the  same  way.  *'  The boy  is  eyerlastingly  tormenting  me  to  buy  him  a  drum.\"  In  the  New  Testament  the  history  of  the  world  is  conceiyed  as  devel- oped through  a  succession  of  aeons.  A  series  of  such  aeons  precedes  the introduction  of  a  new  series  inaug^ated  by  the  Christian  dispensation, and  the  end  of  the  world  and  the  second  coming  of  Christ  are  to  mark  the beginning  of  another  series.  See  Eph.  iii.  11.  Paul  contemplates  aeons before  and  after  the  Christian  era.  Eph.  i.  21 ;  ii.  7 ;  iii.  9,  21 ;  1  Cor. X.  11 ;  comp.  Heb.  ix.  26.  He  includes  the  series  of  aeons  in  one  great aeon,  6  aim^  rwv  aiwnov  the  aeon  of  the  aeons  (Eph.  iii.  21) ;  and  the  author of  the  Epistle  to  the  Hebrews  describes  the  throne  of  God  as  enduring unto  the  aeon  of  the  aeons  (Heb.  L  8).  The  plural  is  also  used,  aeons  of the  aeonSf  signifying  all  the  successive  periods  which  make  up  the  sum total  of  the  ages  collectively.  Rom.  xvi.  27 ;  Gal.  i.  5 ;  Philip,  iv.  20,  etc. This  plural  phrase  is  applied  by  Paul  to  God  only.  The  adjective  alo>vio$  in  like  manner  carries  the  idea  of  time.  Neither the  noun  nor  the  adjective,  in  themselves,  carry  the  sense  of  endless  or everlasting.  They  may  acquire  that  sense  by  their  connotation,  as,  on  the other  hand,  dtSiof ,  wMch  means  everlasting^  has  its  meaning  limited  to  a given  point  of  time  in  Jude  6.  ^Aiwvuk  means  enduring  through  or  pertain- ing to  a  period  of  time.  Both  the  noun  and  the  adjective  are  applied  to limited  periods.  Thus  the  phrase  c2s  tw  aiSmi,  habitually  rendered  for- ever,  is  often  used  of  duration  which  is  limited  in  the  very  nature  of  the case.  See,  for  a  few  out  of  many  instances,  LXX,  Ex.  xxi.  6 ;  xxix.  9 ; xxxii.  13;  Josh.  xiv.  9;  1  Sam.  viii.  13;  Lev.  xxv.  46;  Deut.  xv.  17; 1  Chron.  xxviii.  4.  See  also  Matt.  xxi.  19 ;  J.  xiiL  8 ;  1  Cor.  viii.  13.  The same  is  true  of  oUvuk.  Out  of  150  instances  in  LXX,  four-fifths  imply limited  duration.  For  a  few  instances  see  Gen.  xlviiL  4;  Num.  x.  8; XV.  15 ;  Prov.  xxii.  28 ;  Jonah  ii.  6 ;  Hab.  iiL  6 ;  Isa.  Ixi.  17.  Words  which  are  habitually  applied  to  things  temporal  or  material  can*   60  WORD  STUDIES  IN  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT*         [Ch.  L  not  carry  in  themselves  the  sense  of  endlessness.  Even  when  applied  to God,  we  are  not  forced  to  render  alilmoi  everlasting.  Of  course  tiie  life  of God  is  endless ;  but  the  question  is  whether,  in  describing  God  as  alAmaSf it  was  intended  to  describe  the  duration  of  his  being,  or  whether  some different  and  larger  idea  was  not  contemplated.  That  God  lives  longer than  men,  and  lives  on  everlastingly,  and  has  lived  everlastingly,  are,  no doubt,  great  and  significant  facts ;  yet  they  are  not  the  dominant  or  the most  impressive  facts  in  God's  relations  to  time.  God's  eternity  does  not stand  merely  or  chiefly  for  a  scale  of  length.  It  is  not  primarily  a  mathe- matical but  a  moral  fact.  The  relations  of  God  to  time  include  and  imply far  more  than  the  bare  fact  of  endless  continuance.  They  carry  with  them the  fact  that  God  transcends  time ;  works  on  different  principles  and  on  a vaster  scale  than  the  wisdom  of  time  provides ;  oversteps  the  conditions and  the  motives  of  time ;  marshals  the  successive  aeons  from  a  point  out- side of  time,  on  lines  which  run  out  into  his  own  measureless  cycles,  and for  sublime  moral  ends  which  the  creature  of  threescore  and  ten  years cannot  grasp  and  does  not  even  suspect.  There  in  a  word  for  everlasting  if  that  idea  is  demanded.  That  df&o? occurs  rarely  in  the  New  Testament  and  in  LXX  does  not  prove  that  its place  was  taken  by  (ucmog.  It  rather  goes  to  show  that  less  importance was  attached  to  the  bare  idea  of  everlastingness  than  later  theological thought  has  inven  it.  Paul  uses  the  word  once,  in  Rom.  i.  20,  where  he speaks  of  \"  the  everlasting  power  and  divinity  of  God.\"  In  Rom.  xvi.  26 he  speaks  of  the  eternal  God  (roG  altimav  Oewi) ;  but  that  he  does  not  mean the  everlasting  God  is  perfectly  clear  from  the  context.  He  has  said  that *'  the  mystery  \"  has  been  kept  in  silence  in  times  eternal  (j(pAvfW  aWftbcc), by  which  he  does  not  mean  everlasting  times,  but  the  successive  aeons which  elapsed  before  Christ  was  proclaimed.  God  therefore  is  described as  the  God  of  the  aeons,  the  God  who  pervaded  and  controlled  those  periods before  the  incarnation.  To  the  same  effect  is  the  title  6  jStunXcvs  rwr aitaywv  the  King  of  the  aeons,  applied  to  God  in  1  Tim.  L  17 ;  Apoc.  xv.  8 ; comp.  Tob.  xiii.  6,  10.  The  phrase  irpo  xp^on^  oloii^W  be/ore  eternal  times (2  Tim.  i.  9 ;  Tit.  i.  2),  cannot  mean  before  everlasting  times.  To  say  that God  bestowed  grace  on  men,  or  promised  them  eternal  life  before  endless times,  would  be  absurd.  The  meaning  is  of  old,  as  L.  L  70.  The  grace and  the  promise  were  given  in  time,  but  far  back  in  the  ages,  before  the times  of  reckoning  the  aeons.  Zwf  altavuK  eternal  life,  which  occurs  42  times  in  N.  T.,  but  not  in LXX,  is  not  endless  life,  but  life  pertaining  to  a  certain  age  or  aeon,  or continuing  during  that  aeon.  I  repeat,  life  may  be  endless.  The  life  in union  with  Christ  is  endless,  but  the  fact  is  not  expressed  by  alwvtoi*  Ko- Aa<rts  alcmos,  rendered  everlasting  punishment  (Matt.  xxv.  46),  is  the  pun- ishment peculiar  to  an  aeon  other  than  that  in  which  Christ  is  speaking.

We  have  indeed  no  powers  to  grasp  the  idea  except  through  forms  and images  of  sense.  These  must  be  used,  but  we  must  not  transfer  them  as realities  to  another  order.\"  *  Thus,  while  olcmog  carries  the  idea  of  time,  though  not  of  endlessness^ there  belongs  to  it  also,  more  or  less,  a  sense  of  quality.  Its  character  is ethical  rather  than  mathematical.  The  deepest  significance  of  the  life beyond  time  lies,  not  in  endlessness,  but  in  the  moral  quality  of  the  aeon into  which  the  life  passes.  It  is  comparatively  unimportant  whether  or not  the  rich  fool,  when  his  soul  was  required  of  him  (L.  xiL  20),  entered upon  a  state  that  was  endless.  The  principal,  the  tremendous  fact,  as Christ  unmistakably  puts  it,  was  that,  in  the  new  aeon,  the  motives,  the aims,  the  conditions,  the  successes  and  awards  of  time  counted  for  nothing. In  time,  his  bams  and  their  contents  were  everything;  the  soul  was nothing.  In  the  new  life  the  soul  was  first  and  everything,  and  the  barns and  storehouses  nothing.  The  bliss  of  the  sanctified  does  not  consist  pri- marily in  its  endlessness,  but  in  the  nobler  moral  conditions  of  the  new aeon, — the  years  of  the  holy  and  eternal  God.  Duration  is  a  secondary idea.  When  it  enters  it  enters  as  an  accompaniment  and  outgrowth  of moral  conditions.  In  the  present  passage  it  is  urged  that  oXctfpor  destruction  points  to an  unchangeable,  irremediable,  and  endless  condition.  If  this  be  true,  if HktBpoi  is  extinction,  then  the  passage  teaches  the  annihilation  of  the wicked,  in  which  case  the  adjective  aUnnos  is  superfluous,  since  extinction is  final,  and  excludes  the  idea  of  duration.  But  ^Actfpos  does  not  always mean  destruction  or  extinction.  Take  the  kindred  verb  dwoXXvfu  to  destroy, put  an  end  to,  or  in  the  middle  voice,  to  be  lost,  to  perish.  Peter  says,  '*  the world  being  deluged  with  water,  perished \"  (din&Xcro^  2  Pet.  iii.  6) ;  but the  world  did  not  become  extinct,  it  was  renewed.  In  Heb.  i.  11,  12, quoted  from  Ps.  cii.,  we  read  concerning  the  heavens  and  the  earth  as compared  with  the  eternity  of  God,  *<they  shall  perish**  (dmKoiuimu). But  the  perishing  is  only  preparatory  to  change  and  renewal  ^  They shall  be  changed  \"  (dXXayiitnyrai).  Comp.

It  is  almost  universally  found  in  con- nection with  words  signifying  publication  or  revelation.  See on  Matt.  xiii.  11.

Convenient  sum- maries may  be  found  in  Lttnemann's  Meyer,  Dr.  Gloag's  IrUroducHon  to  the Pauline  Epistles,  and  Bomemann^s  Commentary,  Generally,  it  may  be  said that  Paul  seems  to  predict  a  great  moral  and  religious  defection  which  is  to precede  the  coming  of  the  Lord,  and  which  is  to  reach  its  consummation  in the  appearance  of  an  evil  power  described  as  the  Man  of  Sin,  the  personal incorporation  and  concentration  of  wickedness.  His  coming  is  denoted  by the  same  word  as  the  coming  of  Christ  (japovala,  yer.  0).  He  is  represented as  sitting  in  the  temple  of  God,  exhibiting  himself  as  God,  and  performing miracles  of  falsehood  according  to  the  working  of  Satan.  A  restraining power  is  upon  him,  preventing  his  revelation  before  the  proper  time.  The two  knots  of  the  passage  are  the  identification  of  the  man  of  sin,  and  of  him that  restraineth.  The  man  of  sin  has  been  identified  as  Nero,  the  Pope  of Rome,  Luther,  Mahomet,  Caligula,  Simon  Magus,  Titus.  By  others,  as  rep- resenting not  an  individual,  but  the  succession  of  popes,  the  Jewish  nation, and  especially  the  Sanhedrim.  The  restraining  power  is  explained  as  the Roman  Empire  ;  the  German  Empire ;  the  Roman  Emperor  Vitellius ;  the Apostles ;  the  chiefs  of  the  Jewish  nation  against  Simon  the  son  of  Giora ; the  Emperors  Claudius  and  Vespasian ;  the  pious  Jews  living  at  the  time of  the  destruction  of  Jerusalem ;  James  the  Just.  Opinions  differ  as  to whether  the  man  of  sin  is  an  individual  or  an  organisation.  Romanists  dis- cover him  in  some  representative  enemy  of  Romanism ;  Protestants  in  the  Ro- man church  and  hierarchy.  Before  any  approach  to  a  sound  exegesis  of  the passage  can  be  made,  it  will  be  necessary  to  define  and  settle  the  principles  of apocal3rptic  interpretation,  a  matter  which  is  still  very  much  in  the  dark. About  the  only  valuable  thing  that  can  be  fairly  extracted  from  the  passage is  Paul's  firm  assurance  that  God^s  hand  is  ever  on  the  work  of  evil,  and  that in  whatever  form  or  with  whatever  power  it  may  reveal  Itself,  it  will  inev- itably be  subdued  and  crushed  by  the  power  of  Chxist   68  WOBD  STUDIES  IK  THE  NSW  TB8TAMBMT.

INTRODUCTION.   By  the  churches  of  Gralatia  which  Paul  addresses  (ch.  i.  2) are  most  probably  meant  the  churches  in  the  Roman  province of  Galatia ;  those  namely  in  Iconium,  Pisidian  Antioch,  Lys- tra,  and  Derbe ;  and  not  the  Christians  living  in  the  Galatian district  lying  to  the  north  and  east  of  Lycaonia  and  Phrygia, which  formed  only  a  part  of  the  Roman  province,  and  the chief  cities  of  which  were  Ancyra,  Tavium,  and  Pessinus. The  Roman  province  was  formed  by  Augustus,  25  B.C.,  and included  Lycaonia,  Isauria,  southeastern  Phrygia,  and  a  por- tion of  Pisidia.  The  churches  in  this  province  were  founded by  Paul  in  his  first  missionary  tour,  the  account  of  which  is given  Acts  xiii.,  xiv.*  The  South  Gralatian  hypothesis  supplies  a  defect  in  the history  of  the  Pauline  churches,  which,  on  the  other,  it  is  *  The  view  here  glTen  is  known  aa  the  South  Galatian  hypothesis.  The other  view,  which  limits  the  application  of  the  name  Galatia  to  the  Galatian district,  the  country  of  the  Asiatic  Gauls,  is  known  as  the  North  Galatian hypothesis,  and  is  held  by  the  majority  of  critics.  The  South  Galatian  hy- pothesis was  propoimded  as  early  as  1826  by  Mynster  {IntroducHon  to  the GaUUian  Epittle);  was  maintained  by  the  French  archaeologist  Perrot  (Z>e CMatia  Pravineia  Bamanaj  Paris,  1867),  who  was  followed  by  Renan (Pa«Zt»,  1869);  and  has  been  defended  by  Hausrath,  Weizslicker,  Zahn, Pfleiderer,  Ramsay  (The  Church  in  the  Soman  Empire),  and  McGiflert (Apostolic  Age).

On  the  North  Galatian  hypothesis, although  the  Gralatian  churches  were  the  scene  of  a  violent conflict  between  Paul  and  the  Judaising  Christians,  and  the recipients  of  one  of  Paul's  most  important  letters,  and  are therefore  entitled  to  an  important  place  in  the  history  of  the apostolic  churches,  —  no  mention  of  their  origin  or  founda- tion occurs  in  the  Book  of  Acts,  while  the  founding  of  the churches  of  Pisidia  and  Lycaonia,  which  are  nowhere  named by  Paul,  is  expressly  narrated.  On  the  other  hypothesis,  we have  in  Acts  xiii.,  xiv.,  a  detailed  account  of  the  foundation of  the  Galatian  churches.  From  the  notices  in  the  Acts  and  in  the  Epistle,  it  appears that  Paul's  preaching  in  Gtilatia  met  with  a  favorable  recep- tion. See  Acts  xiii.  42,  48,  49 ;  xiv.  1 ;  Gal.  iv.  18.  We do  not  know  how  long  it  was  before  the  churches  were invaded  by  Jewish  emissaries,  nor  whence  these  came.  They probably  came  from  the  Judaistic  circles  of  the  mother- church  at  Jerusalem,  although  it  is  held  by  some  that they  belonged  to  the  Jewish  Christian  constituency  of  the churches  in  Galatia.  They  declared  that  Paul  was  not  an apostle,  but  at  most  only  a  disciple  of  the  apostles.  He  had had  no  personal  knowledge  of  Christ :  the  contents  of  his gospel  were  derived  from  men,  and  therefore  he  was  entitled to  no  authority.  All  questions  should  be  referred  to  the mother-church  in  Jerusalem,  especially  to  the  great  apostles of  the  circumcision,  the  pillars  of  the  church,  James,  Peter, and  John.  Moreover,  Paul's  teaching  that  righteousness was  based  only  upon  faith  in  Christ  and  not  upon  circum- cision and  legal  observance,  contradicted  the  historical  reve- lation of  God,  since  God  promised  salvation  to  Abraham  and to  his  seed  on  the  ground  of  circumcision ;  and,  in  order  to carry  the  promise  into  effect,  made  the  covenant  of  the  law forever  with  the  people  of  Israel,  who  were  to  receive  the divine  blessing  on  condition  of  observing  the  divine  com- mands. His  teaching,  moreover,  encouraged  moral  license, and  therefore  contravened  all  moral  principle  (v.  18).  They further  accused  him  of  being  a  man-pleaser,  seeking  a  fol- lowing and  adapting  his  preaching  to  the  tast^  of  his  hear-   INTBODUCTION  TO  THE  GALATIAN  EPISTLE.  77  ers ;  preaching  circumcision  to  those  who  were  inclined  to accept  it,  and  uncircumcision  to  such  as  wished  to  refuse  it (V.  11).  These  intruders  were  not  proselytes,  but  born  Jews,  Jewish Christians,  with  a  Pharisaic  tendency  like  that  of  those  who, in  Antioch  and  Jerusalem,  sought  to  impose  circumcision and  legal  observance  upon  Gentile  Christians  (Acts  xv.  1,  5 ; Gal.  ii.  4).  They  demanded  that  the  Gentile  Christians should  be  incorporated  by  circumcision  with  the  community of  Israel,  and  should  observe  the  leading  requirements  of  the Mosaic  law  (v.  2, 11 ;  vi.  12).  They  laid  great  stress  on  the observance  of  sacred  seasons  (iv.  10).  \"They  prescribed  a cultus  with  holy  days  and  festivals,  which  contained  a  more seductive  charm  than  the  exposition  of  the  word;  for  it offered  compensation  for  the  heathenism  they  had  aban- doned, and  the  old  disposition  once  revived  might  easily have  found  in  it  a  congenial  home.\"*  They  did  not  em- phasise the  solemn  duties  which  followed  circumcision,  and which  Paul  himself  forcibly  stated  (v.  3 ;  comp.  iii.  10);  but they  recommended  circumcision  as  an  easy  way  of  attaining salvation  through  mere  formal  incorporation  with  the  true people  of  God,  and  also  as  a  protection  against  persecution (vi.  12 ;  comp.  v.  11).  These  efforts  bore  fruit  among  the  Galatians.  Having thrown  off  the  corruptions  of  their  heathen  faith  and  wor- ship, they  again  came  into  bondage  to  \"  the  weak  and  beg- garly elements\"  which  they  had  outgrown  (iv.  9).  The slightest  tendency  to  such  a  lapse  was  met  and  fostered  by the  daily  appeal  of  the  pagan  cult  amid  which  they  lived, an  elaborate  and  impressive  system,  fortified  with  a  code  of rules  and  administered  by  a  powerful  hierarchy,  the  whole presenting  a  striking  external  resemblance  to  the  Jewish ceremonial  system.  As  Professor  Ramsay  observes:  \"It  is not  until  this  is  properly  apprehended  that  Gal.  iv.  3-11 becomes  clear  and  natural.  Paul  in  that  passage  implies ihat  the  Judaising  movement  of  the  Christian  Galatians  is  a  «  Weizsficker.   78  INTRODUCTION  TO  THE  GALATIAN  BPI8TLR.  recurrence  to  their  old  heathen  type.\"  Paul  describes  them as  arrested  in  a  course  of  obedience  to  the  truth  which  they had  been  running  well  (y.  7)  :  as  soon  removed  into  a  differ- ent gospel  (i.  6) :  as  bewitched  by  an  evil  eye  (iii.  1)  :  as pervaded  with  an  evil  leaven  (v.  9).  They  were  beginning, in  part  at  least,  to  observe  the  Jewish  ceremonial  law :  they were  depending  upon  the  law  for  justification:  they  were declining  from  a  spiritual  to  a  fleshly  economy :  they  were beginning  to  regard  as  an  enemy  the  friend  and  teacher whom,  not  so  long  ago,  they  had  received  as  an  angel  of God,  and  for  whom  they  would  have  plucked  out  their  own eyes  (iv.  14, 16).  To  what  extent  the  Galatian  Christians  had  been  prevailed on  to  accept  circumcision,  we  do  not  know.  The  writing  of this  letter,  however,  implies  that  Paul  did  not  regard  this  evil as  past  arresting.  The  letter  itself  is  marked  by  unity  of  purpose,  cohesion of  thought,  and  force  and  picturesqueness  of  diction.  Like 2d  Corinthians  and  Philippians  it  is  intensely  personal. Like  the  former  of  those  Epistles  it  reveals  the  apostle*s  keen sensitiveness  to  the  attitude  of  his  readers  toirard  himself. It  is  indignant  and  severe,  with  dashes  of  bitterness,  yet  it contains  touches  of  affectionate  reminiscence.  It  is  pervaded and  controlled  by  the  one  purpose  of  meeting  and  correcting the  Gtdatian  apostasy  in  its  twofold  form  of  repudiating  his apostolic  right  and  the  doctrine  of  salvation  by  faith.  The letter  falls  into  three  parts  :  chs.  i.,  ii.,  maintaining  the  inde- pendence and  authority  of  his  apostleship,  and  the  divine origin  of  his  gospel.  Chs.  iii.,  iv.,  defending  the  intrinsic truth  of  his  gospel.  Chs.  v.,  vi.,  exhibiting  the  moral  conse- quences which  legitimately  and  logically  result  from  his gospel.  The  relationship  of  the  Epistle  to  the  Roman  letter  is marked,  yet  it  has  its  special  characteristics  as  distinct  from Romans.  It  bears  the  character  of  a  letter  more  distinctly than  Romans,  which  is  a  treatise.  It  Iajb  a  more  distinct  em- phasis upon  tiie  person  and  apostolic  authority  of  Paul,  and its  dominant  conception  is  the  freedom  of  the  Christisii,  m   INTRODUCTION  TO  THE  QALATIAN  EPISTLE.  79  in  Romans  the  dominant  conception  is  justification  by  faith. Romans  is  more  positively  doctrinal ;  Galatians  more  apolo- getic and  polemic  as  against  Judaism.  Romans  treats  cir- cumcision as  a  question  of  practice ;  Galatians  as  a  question of  law.  As  in  Romans,  faith  is  emphasised  over  against  the works  of  the  law  as  the  ground  of  justification  before  God ; but  equally  with  Romans  the  divinity  and  sanctity  of  the law  are  recognised.  The  law  is  holy,  and  just  and  good.  It is  the  expression  of  God's  sovereign  and  righteous  will.  It reflects  his  character,  and  if  one  could  keep  it  he  would  live by  it  (iii.  12) ;  all  this,  while  it  remains  true  that  ^'  by  the works  of  the  law  shall  no  flesh  be  justified\"  (ii.  16).  Accordingly  the  ethics  of  the  Epistle  are  stem  and  uncom- promising. The  picture  of  the  works  of  the  flesh  is  perhaps not  as  powerful  and  lurid  as  that  in  the  first  chapter  of Romans.  It  is  drawn  in  fewer  lines,  and  is  offset  and  en- forced by  a  picture  of  the  fruits  of  the  Spirit.  Yet  the  one is  no  less  distinct  and  unmistakable  than  the  other.  In Romans  the  sins  of  the  Gentile  world  are  massed  in  a  fearful catalogue ;  in  Gtdatians  single  passages  here  and  there  afford glimpses  of  deeply-rooted  evil  tendencies  in  the  life  of  the newly-converted  Gentile,  which  show  how  hard  it  had  been for  him  to  divest  himself  of  his  pagan  license,  and  which contain  within  themselves  possibilities  of  future  degeneracy. We  see  a  conceit  of  higher  knowledge  and  larger  liberty which  might  readily  seize  upon  ^^  occasions  to  the  flesh,'*  and run  into  what  some  one  has  aptly  styled  \"the  bigotry  of illumination,\"  and  the  selfishness  of  fancied  deeper  insight (v.  15;  vi.  2-5).  The  same  conceit  appears  in  the  weakness and  inconstancy  which  readily  succumb  to  the  flattering overtures  of  pretentious  Jewish  emissaries  (iv.  12  ff. ;  v.  26). Yet  with  rigid  severity  against  such  tendencies  there  is blended  a  tender  compassion  for  the  erring,  a  reasonable  and kindly  appreciation  of  the  weakness  of  the  new  convert.  Professor  Sabatier  (TApStre  Pavl)  says  of  the  Epistle: *^  The  style  does  not  sustain  the  thought ;  it  is  the  thought which  sustains  the  style,  giving  to  it  its  force,  its  life,  its beauty.      Thought  presses  on,  overcharged,  breathless  and   80  INTRODUCTION  TO  THB  QALATIAK  EPISTLE.  hurried,  dragging  the  words  after  it.  .  .  .  Unfinished  phrases, daring  omissions,  parentheses  which  leave  us  out  of  sight and  out  of  breath,  rabbinical  subtleties,  audacious  paradoxes, vehement  apostrophes, — pour  in  like  surging  billows.  Mere words  in  their  ordinary  meaning  are  insufficient  to  sustain this  overwhelming  plenitude  of  thought  and  feeling.  Every phrase  is  obliged,  so  to  speak,  to  bear  a  double  and  triple burden.\" The  authenticity  of  the  letter  is  generally  conceded.*  *  Oal&tians  with  Romans  and  the  two  Corinthian  letters,  were  received  as genuine  and  authentic  by  the  Ttlbingen  critics.  Some  sixteen  yeais  ago  they were  attacked  by  a  small  coterie  of  critics,  chiefly  in  Holland.  Allard  Pier- son  and  S.  A.  Naber  ascribed  the  Paulme  Epistles  to  one  Paulns  Episcopua,  a Christian  ecclesiastic,  who  appropriated  large  portions  of  certain  reformed Jewish  writings,  and  christianised  them  by  means  of  changes  and  interpoli^ tions.  A.  D.  Loman  asserted  that  Christianity  was  a  messianic  movement among  the  Jews ;  that  Jesus  had  no  exiBtence,  but  was  a  purely  mythical embodiment  of  a  series  of  ideas  and  principles  developed  in  the  second  cen- tury. The  four  chief  Epistles  of  Paul  which  contradict  this  hypothesis  are spurious  and  legendary.  Out  of  the  anti-Judaic  and  uniyersalistic  Gnosis  of the  early  part  of  the  second  century,  was  developed  a  Paul-legend  in  the mterest  of  a  universalistic  Christianity.  Romans,  Galatians,  and  Corinthians were  all  written  in  Paul's  name  to  recommend  this  Christianity.  These views  obtained  no  currency,  and  were  repudiated  by  even  the  radical  critica of  Germany.  Rudolph  Steck  of  Bern  (18S8)  held  that  none  of  the  four letters  were  the  work  of  Paul,  but  were  the  product  of  a  Pauline  party  of  the second  century.  He  revived  the  hypothesis  of  the  dependence  of  the  Pauline writin^B  on  Seneca.   COMMENTARIES  ON  OALATIANS.   ENGLISH.  J.  B.  Lightfoot,  lOih  ed.,  1890:  B.

From dyAos, a crowd or mob, with the idea of want of arrangement and discipline, and therefore of confusion and tumult. Hence it is applied to the noise and tumult of a crowd, and so passes into the sense of the trouble and annoyance caused by these, and of trouble generally, like the Latin ¢urbae. Thus Herodotus says of Croesus, when on the funeral-pile he uttered the name of Solon, and the inter- preters begged him to explain what he meant, “ and as they   Cu.

Compare Matt. xiv. 36; Mark vi. 56, where SvecoSnoav, were thoroughly saved, and éadforro, were saved, are used. Luke is more technical, using the strictly medical term, which occurs twenty-eight times in the New Testament, seven- teen of these in Luke. Luke also uses the two words employed by Matthew and Mark, but always with some addition showing the nature of the saving. Thus Luke vii. 3, where duacdoy (A. V., heal) is explained by ver. 7, taSjceras, the technical word, shall be healed, and by ver. 10, “found the servant whole (uys- aivovra, another professional word—see on ch. v. 31) that had been sick.” Compare, also, Luke viii. 35, 36, 44, 47, 48. Medi- cal writers do not use cotew or Siacwtew, to save, as equivalent to iaa9at, to heal, but in the sense of escaping from a severe ill- ness or from some calamity. Luke employs it in this sense— Acts xxvii. 44; xxviii. 1.   Tar Sermon on THE Moont.   90-49. Compare Matt. v. 1 to viii. 1. 90. Lifted up his eyes. Peculiar to Luke.

Luke adopts the style of di- rect address; Matthew of abstract statement.   310 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VL   Kingdom of God (4 Bactrcia Tod Jeov). Matthew has king- dom of heaven, or of the heavens (rv ovpavev), a phrase used by him only, and most frequently employed by Christ himself to describe the kingdom ; though Matthew also uses, less fre- quently, kingdom of God. The two are substantially equiva- lent terms, though the pre-eminent title was kingdom of God, since it was expected to be fully realized in the Messianic era, when God should take upon himself the kingdom by a visible representative. Compare Isa. xl. 9, “ Behold your God.” The phrase kingdom of Heaven was common in the Rabbinical writ- ings, and had a double signification: the Azstorical kingdom and the spiritual and moral kingdom. They very often under- stood by it diwine worship; adoration of God; the sum of religious duties ; but also the Messianic kingdom.  The kingdom of God is, essentially, the absolute dominion of God in the universe, both in a physical and a spiritual sense. It is “an organic commonwealth which has the principle of its existence in the will of God” (Tholuck). It was foreshadowed in the Jewish theocracy. The idea of the kingdom advanced toward clearer definition from Jacob’s prophecy of the Prince out of Judah (Gen. xlix. 10), through David’s prophecy of the everlasting kingdom and the king of righteousness and peace (Ps. xxii., Ixxii.), through Isaiah, until, in Daniel, its eternity and superiority over the kingdoms of the world are brought strongly out. For this kingdom Israel looked with longing, ex- pecting its realization in the Messiah; and while the common idea of the people was narrow, sectarian, Jewish, and political, yet “there was among the people a certain consciousness that the principle itself was of universal application ” (Tholuck). In Daniel this conception is distinctly expressed (vii. 14-27 5 iv. 25 ; ii. 44). In this sense it was apprehended by John the Baptist.  The ideal kingdom is to be realized in the absolute rule of the eternal Son, Jesus Christ, by whom all things are made and con- sist (John i. 3; Col. i. 16-20), whose life of perfect obedience to God and whose sacrificial offering of love upon the cross reveal to men their true relation to God, and whose spirit works to bring them into this relation. The ultimate idea of the kingdom is that of “‘a redeemed humanity, with its divinely revealed destiny   Cu. VL] LUKE. 311   manifesting itself in a redigcous communion, or the Church; a social communion, or the state ; and an aesthetic communion, ex- pressing itself in forms of knowledge and art.”  This kingdom is both present (Matt. xi. 12; xii. 28; xvi. 19; Luke xi. 20; xvi. 16; xvii. 215; see, also, the parables of the Sower, the Tares, the Leaven, and the Drag-net ; and compare the expression “theirs, or yours, 7s the kingdom,” Matt. v. 3; Luke vi. 20) and future (Dan. vii. 27; Matt. xiii. 48; xix. 28; Kav: Siuxye2d sp Markisx. 475 °2\\Pet. palin 1)Cor, yl 9; Apoc. xx. sq.). As a present kingdom it is incomplete and in process of development. It is expanding in society like the grain of mustard seed (Matt. xiii. 381, 32); working toward the pervasion of society like the leaven in the lump (Matt. xiii. 33). God zs in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, and the Gospel of Christ is the great instrument in that process (2 Cor. v. 19, 20). The kingdom develops from within outward under the power of its essential divine energy and law of growth, which insures its progress and final triumph against all ob- stacles. Similarly, its work in reconciling and subjecting the world to God begins at the fountain-head of man’s life, by im- planting in his heart its own divine potency, and thus giving a divine impulse and direction to the whole man, rather than by moulding him from without by a moral code. The law is written in his heart. In like manner the State and the Church are shaped, not by external pressure, like the Roman empire and the Romish hierarchy, but by the evolution of holy char- acter in men. The kingdom of God in its present develop- ment is not identical with the Church. It is a larger movement which includes the Church. The Church is identified with the kingdom to the degree in which it is under the power of the spirit of Christ. ‘“ As the Old Testament kingdom of God was perfected and completed when it ceased to be external, and be- came internal by being enthroned in the heart, so, on the other hand, the perfection of the New Testament kingdom will con- sist in its complete incarnation and externalization; that is, when it shall attain an outward manifestation, adequately ex- pressing, exactly corresponding to its internal principle ” (Tho- luck). The consummation is described in Apoc. xxi., xxii.   312 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VL 91. Now. Peculiar to Luke. Shall be filled. See on Matt. v. 6.   Weep (kdaiovtes). Strictly, to weep audibly. See on mev- Sodvres, mowrn, Matt. v. 4.   Laugh (yeddcere). Matthew, shall be comforted. 22. Compare Matt. v. 11.   Son of Man. The phrase is employed in the Old Testa- ment as a circumlocution for man, with special reference to his frailty as contrasted with God (Num. xxiii. 19; Ps. viii. 4; Job xxv. 6; xxxv. 8; and eighty-nine times in Ezekiel). It had also a Messianic meaning (Dan. vii. 13 sq.), to which our Lord referred in Matt. xxiv. 80; xxvi. 64. It was the title which Christ most frequently applied to himself; and there are but two instances in which it is applied to him by another, viz., by Stephen (Acts vii. 56) and by John (Apoe. i. 18; xiv. 14); and when acquiescing in the title “Son of God,” addressed to him- self, he sometimes immediately after substitutes “ Son of Man” (John i. 50, 52; Matt. xxvi. 63, 64).  The title asserts Christ’s humanity—his absolute identifica- tion with our race: “his having a genuine humanity which could deem nothing human strange, and could be touched with a feeling of the infirmities of the race which he was to judge” (Liddon, “Our Lord’s Divinity”). It also exalts him as the representative ideal man. “All human history tends to him and radiates from him; he is the point in which humanity finds its unity; as St. Irenaeus says, ‘ He recapitulates it.’ He closes the earlier history of our race; he inaugurates its future. Nothing local, transient, individualizing, national, sectarian dwarfs the proportions of his world-embracing character. He rises above the parentage, the blood, the narrow horizon which bounded, as it seemed, his human life. He is the archetypal man, in whose presence distinction of race, intervals of ages, types of civilization, degrees of mental culture are as nothing” (Liddon).   Cu. VI.] LUKE. 313   But the title means more. As Son of Man he asserts the authority of judgment over all flesh. By virtue of what he is as Son of Man, he must be more. “The absolute relation to the world which he attributes to himself demands an absolute relation to God. . . . Heisthe Son of Man, the Lord of the world, the Judge, only because he is the Son of God” (Luthardt). Christ’s humanity can be explained only by his divinity. A humanity so unique demands a solution. Divested of all that is popularly called miraculous, viewed simply as a man, under the historical conditions of his life, he is a greater miracle than all his miracles combined. The solution is ex- pressed in Heb. i.   23. Leap for joy (cxiptjcare). See ch. i. 41,44. Compare Matthew, de exceeding glad (ayadNao3e: see on 1 Pet. i. 6).   Their fathers. Peculiar to Luke. 24. Woe. These woes are not noted by Matthew.   Have received (azéyere). In Matt. vi. 5, 16, the Rev. has properly changed “ they have their reward” to “ they have re- cewed.” The verb, compounded of aro, off or from, and éya, to have, literally means to have nothing left to desire. 'Thus in Philip. iv. 18, when Paul says, “JZ have all things (aréyw mdyta),” he does not mean merely an acknowledgment of the receipt of the Church’s gift, but that he is fudly furnished. “I have all things to the full.”   Consolation (zapdkdyows). From apd, to the side of, and xanréo, to call or summon. Literally, a calling to one’s side to help ; and therefore entreaty, passing on into the sense of ex- hortation, and thence into that of consolatory exhortation ; and so coming round to mean that which one ws summoned to give to a suppliant—consolation. Thus it embodies the cali for help, and the response to the call. Its use corresponds with that of the kindred verb zrapaxanréw, to exhort or console. In its original sense of calling for aid the noun appears in the New   B14 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VI.   Testament only in 2 Cor. viii. 4: with much entreaty. The verb appears frequently in this sense, rendered beseech, pray (Matt. viii. 34; xiv. 36; Mark i. 40; v. 12, etc). In the sense of consolation or comfort the noun occurs in Luke ii. 25; vi. 24; 2 Cor. i.3; vii. 4; Philem. 7. The verb, in Matt. 11.18; v. 4; Luke xvi. 25; 2 Cor. i. 4. In some instances, however, the meaning wavers between console and exhort. In the sense of exhortation or counsel, the noun may be found in Acts xiii. 15 ; Rom. xii. 8; Heb. xiii. 22. The verb, in Acts ii. 40; xi. 23; xiv. 22; Rom. xii. 8; Tit. ii. 15. Neither the noun nor the verb appear in the writings of John, but the kindred word mapaxdyT0s, the Paraclete, Comforter, or Advocate, is peculiar to him. On this word, see on John xiv. 16. It should be noted, however, that the word comfort goes deeper than its popular conception of soothing. It is from the later Latin confortare, to make strong. Thus Wycliffe renders Luke i. 80, “the child waxed, and was comforted in spirit” (A. V., waxed strong); and Tyndale, Luke xxii. 43, “there appeared an angel from heaven comforting him” (A. V., strengthening). The comfort which Christ gives is not always soothing. The Holy Spirit, the Com- forter, is to convince of sim and of judgment. Underlying the word is the sense of a wise counsel or admonition which rouses and braces the moral nature and encourages and strengthens it to do and to endure. When, therefore, Christ says ‘“ they that mourn shall be comforted,” he speaks in recognition of the fact that all sorrow is the outcome of sin, and that true comfort is given, not only in pardon for the past, but in strength to fight and resist and overcome sin. The atmosphere of the word, in short, is not the atmosphere of the sick-chamber, but the tonic breath of the open world, of moral struggle and victory; the atmosphere for him that climbs and toils and fights.   25. Mourn and weep (rrevdncete xal xravoete). See on Matt. v. 4.   26. Well (xadas). Handsomely, fairly.   27. Which hear. With the sense of hearing in order to heed: giving heed. Compare Matt. xi. 15.   Cu. VL} LUKE. 315   29. Cheek (ciayova). Lit., the jaw. The cheek is raped. The blow intended is not, therefore, a mere slap, but a heavy blow ; an act of violence rather than of contempt.   Taketh away (aipovtos). Lit., taketh up, lifteth. Cloke—coat. See on Matt. v. 40.   30. Every one. Peculiar to Luke. Augustine remarks, “omni petenti, non omnia petenti; give to every one that asks, but not everything he asks.”   Asketh (airodvrz). See on Matt. xv. 23. Compare Matt. v. 42.   Ask again (amaire). Only here and ch. xii. 20. Used in medical language of diseases demanding or requiring certain treatment.   32. What thank (zro/a)? What Aindof thanks? Not what is your reward, but what is its guality ? On thank (ydpus), see on ch. i. 30.   34, Lend (éaveifere). Properly, at interest.   Sinners (01 duaprwdol). The article marks them as a class. So, often in New Testament, as when classed with publicans.   Love. Not ¢cdovdo1, which implies an énstinctive, affectionate attachment, but dyara@ow, of a sentiment based on judgment and calculation, which selects its object for a reason. See, farther, on John xxi. 15-17. Tynd., the very sinners love their lovers.   35. Hoping for nothing again (udev amedmitovtes). A later Greek word, only here in New Testament, and meaning originally to gwe up in despair, a sense which is adopted by some high authorities, and by Rev., never despairing. Luke   316 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca. VL   was familiar with this sense in the Septuagint. Thus Isa. xxix. 19, “The poor among men (of dmmdmucpévor TOV avd pwrrav) shall rejoice.” So in Apocrypha, 2 Mac. ix. 18, “ despairing of his health; ” Judith ix. 11, “ A saviour of them that are with- out hope (amnricpévor).” According to this, the sense here is, “do good as those who consider nothing as lost.” The verb and its kindred adjective are used by medical writers to describe desperate cases of disease.   Children of the Highest (viol tlorov). Rev., rightly, sons. Compare Matt. v. 45, 48.   Kind (ypnords). See on Matt. xi. 30. 36. Merciful (ocetippoves). See on Jas. v. 11.   37. Forgive (dmodvere). Lit., release. So Rev., Christ ex- horts to the opposite of what he has just forbidden: “do not condemn, but release.” Oompare ch. xxii. 68; xxiii. 16, 17.   38. Pressed down (qevecpévov). Only here in New Tes- tament. A common medical term for pressing strongly on a part of the body, and opposed to aavewv, to touch gently.   Shaken together, running over. Bengel says, “ Pressed down, as dry articles; shaken together, as soft goods ; running over, as liquids.” But this is fanciful and incorrect. The allusion in every case is toa dry measure; and the climax in the three participles would be destroyed by Bengel’s interpretation.   Bosom (rov xéAmov). The gathered fold of the wide upper garment, bound together with the girdle, and thus forming a pouch. In the Eastern markets at this day vendors may be seen pouring the contents of a measure into the bosom of a purchaser. In Ruth iii. 15, Boaz says to Ruth, “ Bring the val (the mantle, so Rev., Old Testament), that thou hast upon thee, and hold it (hold it open): and he measured six measures of barley into it.” Compare Isa. lxv. 7, “I will measure their   Cu. VL] LUKE. oly   former work into their bosom ; also Jer. xxxii. 18. In Acts xxvii. 89, the word is used of a bay in a beach, forming a bend in the land like the hollow of a robe. Similarly, the Latin sinus means both the hanging, baggy bosom of a robe and a bay.   39. Can the blind (ure Suvaras tupd0s)? The interrogative particle expects a negative reply. Surely the bland cannot, etc.   Lead (cdnyeiv). Better, guide, as Rev., since the word com- bines the ideas of leading and instructing.   Shall they not (ovy!)? Another interrogative particle, this time expecting an affirmative answer.   40. Perfect (xatnpticpévos). Rev., rendering the participle more literally, perfected. See on Matt. iv. 21. The word sig- nifies to readjust, restore, set to rights, whether in a physical or a moral sense. See 1 Cor. i. 10, where Paul exhorts to be per- feetly joined together (katnpticpévor) in opposition to bemg diwided. In Gal. vi. 1, it is used of restoring a brother taken in a fault. Hence the meaning to perfect, as Eph. iv. 12. Used in medical language of setting a bone or joint.   41. Beholdest (Snérets)—considerest («atavoets)—mote (xappos)—beam (doxov). See on Matt. vii. 3.   42. Brother. “Expressing the pretence of fraternal duty. To this is opposed ‘ Thou hypocrite!’ ” (Bengel).   Let me cast out (ddes éxBadw) with a studied courtesy : allow me to cast out.   See clearly to cast out. See on Matt. vii. 5. 43. A good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit (od éo7ww   SévSpov Kadov, Tovobv Kaptov campov).

VI.   mologically akin to onmw, in Jas. v. 2: “ Your riches are cor- rupted.” The word means rotten, stale.   Neither. Rev., nor again. The A. V. omits again (radu, on the other hand).   44, Bramble=bush (Sarov.) Matthew has tpiBonrar, thistles. The word occurs only once outside of Luke’s writings, in Mark xii. 26, where it is used as the familiar title of a section of the Pentateuch. Luke also uses it in the same way (xx. 37). He was doubtless acquainted with it medicinally, as it was exten- sively used by ancient physicians. Galen has a chapter on its medicinal uses, and the medical writings abound in prescriptions of which it is an ingredient. Galen also has a saying similar to our Lord’s: “ A farmer could never make a bramble bear grapes.” It is the word employed by the Septuagint for the bush out of which God spoke to Moses.   Grapes (ctagvanv). Lit., a cluster of grapes. 45. Evil. See on Lukeiii. 19.   47. | will shew you to whom he is like. Peculiar to Luke. See on Matt. vi. 24.   48. Digged deep (€oxawrev cai €8aSuvev). The A. V. re- gards the two words asa strong expression of a single idea; but the idea is twofold: he dug (through the sand), and deepened down into the solid rock. So Rev., rightly, he digged and went deep.   The flood (7Anputpas). There is no article: a flood. The word occurs in Luke only, and only in this passage. As a med- ical term it is used of excess of fluids in the body: flooding.   Beat vehemently (pocéppnEev). Rev., more literally, brake. Used by physicians of a rupture of the veins. It occurs only here and ver.49. Matthew has wpocéxowav, beat.   Cu. VII.) LUKE. 319   49. Upon the earth without a foundation. Matthew, upon the sand. The two men are conceived as alike selecting a spot where the sand overlies the rock. The one builds directly upon the sand, the other digs through and down into the rock.   It fell (éecev). But the best texts read cuvérecer, fell to- gether, collapsed. Rev., fell in. Only here in New Testament. In medical language used of the falling-in of parts of the body. Thus Hippocrates, “the temples fadlen in: the limb quickly collapses or shrivels.” Matthew uses the simple verb ézecen,   fell.   Ruin (piypa). Lit., breaking. Only here in New Testa- ment. A medical term for a laceration or rupture. Matthew has mra@ats, the fall.   CHAPTER VIZ. 1-10. Compare Matt. viii. 5-13.   1. Sayings (para). See on ch. i. 37.   In the ears (ets ras axoas). Lit., intothe ears. See onears, Luke iv. 37.   2. Centurion (éxatovtdpyov). From ékatov, a hundred, and dpyw, to command. Commander of a hundred men. Mark uses Kevtuptwv, a Graecized form of the Latin word centurto. A. centuria was originally a division consisting of a hundred things of a kind; and thence came to mean any division, whether con- sisting of a hundred or not. In military language it meant a di- vision of troops, a company, not necessarily of a hundred, the captain of which was called centurio. The numbers of a cen- tury varied from about fifty to a hundred. The Roman legion consisted of ten cohorts or o7retpa., bands, as “ the Italian band,” of which Cornelius was a centurion (Acts x. 1). The command- ers of these cohorts were called chiliarchs, or chief captains   320 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VII.   (John xviii. 12, Rev.). Each cohort contained six centuries, or companies, of which the commanders were called centurions. The duty of the centurion was chiefly confined to the regulation of his own corps, and the care of the watch. The badge of his office was the vitis, or vine-stock. He wore a short tunic, and was also known by letters on the crest of his helmet. Dean Howson (“ Companions of St. Paul”) remarks on the favorable impression left upon the mind by the officers of the Roman army mentioned in the New Testament, and cites, besides the centu- rion in this passage, the one at the cross, and Julius, who es- corted Paul to Rome. See, further, on Acts x. 1.   Servant (S05\\0s). A bond-servant. Matthew has rats, a servant, which occurs also at ver. 7.   Dear (évripos). Lit., held in honor or value. It does not necessarily imply an affectionate relation between the master and the servant, though such may well have existed. It may mean only that he was a valuable servant. See on 1 Pet. ii. 4. In this case Luke omits the mention of the disease, which is given by Matthew.   Beseeching (épwrav). Too strong. Better asking, as Rev. The word to beseech (7rapaxadéw) occurs in the next verse. See on Matt. xv. 23.   Heal (Ssacdon). Better as Rev., save. See on ch. vi. 19.   4. They besought him instantly (crapexdAouy o7rovdaiws). On besought, see on ch. vi. 24. Instantly, which commonly means at once, is used in its older meaning, pressingly, from the Latin instare, to urge or press upon. So Rom. xii. 12, “instant in prayer.” Wye., prayed busily.   That he was worthy (67 aus éotw). The A. V. renders drt as a conjunction, that. The Rev., more correctly, takes it as a mark of quotation, besides properly rendering éo7tuv és, in- stead of was.

He is emphatic; hem- self, at his own expense.   A synagogue (tv ovvaywyyv). The article, “the syna- gogue,” marks the particular synagogue which these elders represented. Hence Rev., rightly, “‘owr synagogue.” “He did not merely avoid profaning the synagogue ” (Bengel).   6. Went (ézopevero). The imperfect tense is explained by what follows. He was going, was on the way, when he was met by the second messenger from the centurion.   Friends. Possibly kinsmen, not elders now.   Trouble (cxvdrdov). Lit., worry. See on Matt. ix. 36; Mark v. 35,   Worthy (icavos). Lit., sufficient. Compare Matt. iii. 11, “worthy to bear ;” and 2 Cor. iii. 5, “ not that we are sufficient (‘xavol), but our sufficiency (ixavorns) is of God.” It is also used in the sense of much, many, long.

The words set under are commonly understood to mean placed in a subordinate position ; but this would be more accurately ex- pressed by the perfect participle, reraypévos. The present parti- ciple indicates something operating daily, and the centurion is describing not his appointed position so much as his daily course of life. The word set originally means arranged, drawn up wm order ; so that the words might be paraphrased thus: “T am a man whose daily course of life and duty is appointed and arranged by superior authority.” The centurion speaks in a figure which is well explained by Alford: “I know how to obey, being myself under authority; and I know how others obey, having soldiers under me. If then I, in my subordinate station of command, am obeyed, how much more thou, who art over all, and whom diseases serve as their Master.” Just what estimate of Jesus these words imply we cannot say. It seems evident, at least, that the centurion regarded him as more than man. If that be so, it is a question whether the word man (avSpwrds) may not imply more than is commonly assigned to it. Taking the Greek words in their order they may read, “For I also, a man (as compared with thee), am set under authority, having soldiers under myself. See on Matt. viii. 9.   10. Whole (iyuaivovra).

It must have been in this steep descent, as, according to Eastern custom, they ‘ car- ried out the dead man,’ that, ‘nigh to the gate’ of the village, the bier was stopped, and the long procession of mourners stayed, and ‘the young man delivered back to his mother’” (Stanley, “ Sinai and Palestine”). “It is in striking accord with the one biblical incident in the history of Nain that renders it dear to the Christian heart, that about the only remains of antiquity are tombs. These are cut in the rock, and are situated on the hillside to the east of the village” (Thomson, “ Land and Book”).   12. Carried out. The tombs were outside of the city.   13. The Lord.

Note, moreover, that Luke distinguishes here between disease and demoniac possession, as often. See ch. vi. 17, 18; Will AZ sexaitro 2:   He gave (éyapicato).

Sometimes, in later Greek, applied to a capital or royal city, a royal treasury, and a royal diadem.   26. A prophet (spodyrnv). The popular conception of a prophet is limited to his foretelling future events. This is in- deed included in the term, but does not cover its meaning en- tirely. The word is from gyi, to speak, and mpd, before, in Front of. This meaning of the preposition may have reference to tume, viz., before, beforehand ; or to place, viz., in front of, and so, publicly ; and this latter meaning, in turn, easily runs into that of in behalf of; for. The prophet is, therefore, pri- marily, one who speaks standing before another, and thus forming a medium between him and the hearer. This sense runs natur- ally into that of instead of. Hence it is the technical term for the interpreter of a divine message. So Plato: “ For this rea- son it is customary to appoint diviners or interpreters to be judges of the true inspiration. Some persons call them diners, seers (wadvres); they do not know that they are only repeaters of dark sayings and visions, and are not to be called dwiners at all, but interpreters (rpopfrat) of things divine” (“ Timaeus,” 72). Similarly of an adwocate to speak for, or instead of one. The central idea of the word is, one to whom God reveals him- self and through whom he speaks. The revelation may or may not relate to the future. The prophet is a forth-teller, not necessarily a foreteller. The essence of the prophetic character   326 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. VIL   is immediate intercourse with God. One of the Hebrew names for “ prophet,” and, as some maintain, the earlier name, signi- fied a shewer or seer.

They spoke to those at table on business or the news of the day, and our host spoke freely to them” (“Parables”). Bernard beautifully says: “Thanks to thee, most blessed sinner: thou hast shown the world a safe enough place for sinners—the feet of Jesus, which spurn none, reject none, repel none, and receive and admit all. Where alone the Pharisee vents not his haughtiness, there surely the Ethiopian changes his skin, and the leopard his spots” (cit. by Trench, “ Parables”).   Sat (xatdxevtas).

Paul  uses  it  mainly  with  an  ethical  reference — moral  judg- ment as  related  to  action.  See  Som.  xii.  2,  where  the  renewing of  the  F0V9  mind  is  urged  as  a  necessary  preliminary  to  a  right moral  judgment  (\"that  ye  lURy jprove,^^  etc.).

Godet  remarks  that  this  is  the  passage  in  all  Paul's  epistles which  presents  the  most  points  of  contact  with  profane  litera- ture. Thus  Ovid :  ^^  Desire  counsels  me  in  one  direction,  rea- son in  another.\"  ^^  I  see  and  approve  the  better,  but  I  follow the  worse.\"  Epictetus :  ^^  He  who  sins  does  not  what  he  would, and  does  what  he  would  not.\"  Seneca:  ^^What,  then,  is  it that,  when  we  would  go  in  one  direction,  drags  us  in  the  other?\" See  also  the  passage  in  Plato  (^^  Phaedrus,\"  246),  in  which  the   84  WORD  8TUDIE9  IN  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT.

In  explaining  this  much-disputed  phrase, it  must  be  noted ;  1.  That  Paul  associates  the  dominion  and energy  of  sin  prominently  with  the  body,  though  not  as  if  sin were  inherent  in  and  inseparable  from  the  body.  2.  Tliat  he represonts  the  service  of  sin  through  the  body  as  associated with,  identified  with,  tending  to,  resulting  in,  death.  And therefore,  3.  Tiiat  he  may  properly  speak  of  the  literal  body  as a  hody  of  death — this  death,  wliich  is  the  certain  issne  of  the abject  captivity  to  sin.  4.  That  Paul  is  not  expressing  a  desire to  escape  from  the  body,  and  therefore  for  death.  Meyer  para- phrases correctly ;  \"  Who  sliall  deliver  me  out  of  bondage  un- der the  law  of  sin  into  moral  freedom,  in  which  my  body  shall no  longer  serve  as  the  scat  of  tbis  shameful  death ! \"  Ignatius, in  his  letter  to  the  Smyrnaeans,  speaks  of  one  who  denies Christ's  humanity,  as  veicpo^pa^  one  who  oarrieg  a  corpse. 1^  I  myself.

Looking  back  and  suni- iniug  np  the  unregenerate  condition,  preparatory  to  setting forth  its  opposite  in  ch.  viii,  Paul  says  therefore,  that,  so  far as  conceiTis  his  moral  intelligence  or  reason,  he  approves  and pays  homage  to  God's  law ;  but,  being  in  bondage  to  sin,  made of  flesh,  sold  under  sin,  the  fleah  carries  him  its  own  way  and commands  his  allegiance  to  the  economy  of  ain.

See  Judges  ix.  23;  1  Sam.  xvi.  14-16,  23;  xviii.  10;  1  Kings xxii.  21  sqq. ;  Isa.  xix.  4.

It  is  also  closely  associated  with  life,  Rom. Tiii.  2,  6,  11,13;  1  Cor.  xv.  4,  6;  2  Cor.  iii.  6;  Gal.  v.  25  ; vi.  8.

It  reveals  itself in  aonfession  (1  Cor.  xii.  3);  in  the  consciousness  of  aonship (Rom.  viii.  16) ;  in  the  knowledge  of  the  love  of  God  (Rom.  v. 5) ;  i»  the  peace  and  joy  of  faith  (Rom.  xiv.  17 ;  1  Thesa.  i,  6) ; in  Itope  (Horn,  v.  5;  xv.  13).

It  man- ifests itself  in  the  diversity  of  forms  and  operations,  appearing under  two  main  aspects :  a  difference  of  g^isy  and  a  difference of  /unctions.  See  Bom.  viii.  9 ;  1  Cor.  iii.  16 ;  v.  i.  ll ;  xii. 13 ;  Eph.  1.  13 ;  iv.  3,  4,  30 ;  Philip,  ii.  1 ;  1  Cor.  xii.  4,  7,  11.  As  compared  with  tlie  Old-Testament  conception,  Paul's irvevfia  ^'  is  the  roach  of  the  Old  Testament,  conceived  as  mani- festing itself  after  a  manner  analogous  to,  but  transcending,  its earlier  forms.  It  bears  the  same  characteristic  marks  of  divine origin,  of  supernatural  power,  of  motive  energy  in  active  exer- cise— standing  in  intimate  relation  to  the  fuller  religious  life and  distinctive  character  and  action  of  its  recipients.  But while  in  the  Old  Testament  it  is  partial,  occasional,  intermit- tent, here  it  is  general,  constant,  pervading.  While  in  the  Old Testament,  as  well  as  in  the  Kew,  its  forms  of  manifestation are  diverse,  they  are  expressly  referred  under  the  New  to  one and  the  same  Spirit.  While  in  the  Old  Testament  they  con- template mainly  the  official  equipment  of  men  for  special  work given  them  to  perform,  they  include  under  the  Kew  the  inward energy  of  moral  action  in  tlie  individual,  no  less  than  the  gifts requisite  for  the  edification  of  the  Church ;  they  embrace  the whole  domain  of  the  religious  life  in  the  believer,  and  in  the community  to  which  he  belongs.  The  irveOfia  of  the  apostle  is not  the  life-breath  of  man  as  originally  constituted  a  creature  of God  ;  but  it  is  the  life-spirit  of  \"  the  new  creation  \"  in  which all  things  have  become  new  \"  (Dickson).  With  the  relation  of  this  word  to  '^^v^  sovl  is  bound  up  the complicated  question  whether  Paul  recognizes  in  the  human personality  a  trichotomy^  or  threefold  dwision  into  body,  soul, and  spirit  On  the  one  side  it  is  claimed  that  Paul  r^ards man  as  consisting  of  body,  the  material  element  and  physical basis  of  his  being ;  soul,  the  principle  of  animal  life ;  and  spiritj the  higher  principle  of  the  intellectual  nature.  On  the  other side,  tliat  spirit  and  sotd  represent  different  sides  or  functions of  the  one  inner  man ;  the  former  embracing  the  higher  powers more  especially  distinctive  of  man,  the  latter  the  feelings  and appetites.     The  threefold  distinction  is  maintained  chiefly  on   1)0  WORD  STUDIES  IN  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT.       [Ch.  VUL  the  basis  of  1  Theaa.  v.  23.

The word tuyydavovra throws an element of chance into the case. Lit., happening to be half dead ; or “leaving him half dead, as it chanced ;” his condition being a matter of unconcern to these robbers. The word jyuw9avh, haif dead, occurs nowhere else in the New Tes- tament. The best texts, however, omit tuyxdvovta.   31. By chance (xara cvyxuplav). Only here in New Testa- ment. The word means, literally, a coincidence. By coinci- dence of circumstances.   There came down. Imperfect, was going down, as Rev.   Priest. The Talmudists said that there were almost as many priests at Jericho as at Jerusalem.   Passed by on the other side (avtirapyAJev). The verb occurs only here and ver. 32.   39. Came and looked.

From map, all, and Séyopuat, to receive: a place of common reception. See on inn, ch. ii. 7. Remains of two xhans, or inns, on the road between Jericho and Jerusalem are mentioned by modern travellers. Porter (“ Handbook of Syria and Palestine”) speaks of one about a mile from Bethany, and another farther on, at the most dangerous part of the road, an extensive, ruined cara- vanserai, called Ahan el Almah, situated on the top of a bleak ridge. Concerning the former, Hepworth Dixon (“Holy Land”) says: “ About midway in the descent from Bethany to Jericho, in a position commanding a view of the road above and below, . . . on the very spot where search would be made for them, if no such ruins were suspected of existing, stands a pile of stones, archways, lengths of wall, which the wandering Arabs call Khan Houdjar, and still make use of as their own resting-place for the night. These ruins are those of a noble inn; the lewan, the fountain, and the court, being plainly traceable in the ruins.”   Cu. X.] LUKE. 357   35. Two pence. About thirty-five cents.

More correctly, has become neighbor. Jesus throws himself back to the time of the story. So Rev., proved neighbor. “The neighbor Jews became strangers. The stranger Samaritan became neighbor to the wounded traveller ” (Alford).   37. He that shewed mercy on him. Rather with him (wera): dealt with him as with a brother. The lawyer avoids the hated word Samaritan.   Tue VisIT AT THE HOUSE IN Beruany, 38-42. Peculiar to Luke.   38. Received (i7edéEato). From tio, under, and déyouat, to receive. Received him under her roof. Martha is marked as the head of the household. Itwas her house. She received the guest, and was chiefly busy with the preparations for his entertainment (ver. 40).   39. Sat (wapaxa3éotevca). Only here in New Testament. Lit., sat beside (rapa).   40. Was cumbered (srepsecraro). Only here in New Tes- tament. The Rev. might better have inserted in the text the marginal rendering, was distracted. The verb means, literally, to draw from around (rept). Martha’s attention, instead of centring round Jesus, was drawn hither and thither. The mepi, around, in composition with the verb, is followed imme- diately by another 7repi, “about much serving.”   Came to him (émicrdca).

The verb consists of three elements: AauBdve, to take hold ; ovv, together with ; avri, recyprocally— doing her part as Martha does hers. It might be paraphrased, therefore, take hold and do her part along with me. It occurs only here and Rom. viii. 26, of the Spirit Helping our infirmi- ties, where all the elements of the verb are strikingly exempli- fied.   Al. Thou art anxious (wepsuvds).

Lit., beginnings ; the extremity or corner, marking a beginning of the sheet. ‘“ We are to imagine the vessel, looking like a colossal four-cornered linen cloth, letting itself down, while the corners attached to heaven to support the whole.” The word is used in this sense by Herodotus, describ- ing the sacrifices of the Scythians. The victim’s forefeet are bound with a cord, “and the person who is about to offer, taking his station behind the victim, pulls the end (adpyiv) of the rope, and thereby throws the animal down” (iv., 60). The suggestion of ropes holding the corners of the sheet (Alford, and, cautiously, Farrar) is unwarranted by the usage of the word. It was the technical expression in medical language for the ends of bandages. The word for sheet in this passage was also the technical term for a bandage, as was the kindred word 6960», used of the linen bandages in which the Lord’s body was swathed. See Luke xxiv. 12; John xix. 40; xx.5,6,7.

But as relatives or kinsmen is expressed by ovyyeveis, this must be taken in the sense of intimate Sriends, a meaning which it has in later Greek writers.   25. Worshipped (spocexvvycev). An unfortunate transla: tion, according to modern English usage, but justified by the   Cu. XJ THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 501   usage of earlier English, according to which to worship meant simply to honor. Worship is worthship, or honor paid to dig- nity or worth. This usage survives in the expressions worship- ful and your worship. Inthe marriage-service of the English Church occurs the phrase, “With my body I thee worshap.” So Wycliffe renders Matt. xix.19, “ Worship thy father and thy mother;” and John xii. 26, “If any man serve me, my Father shall worship him.” Here the meaning is that Cornelius paid reverence by prostrating himself after the usual oriental manner.   28. An unlawful thing (a9éucT0v). The word is peculiar to Peter, being used only here and 1 Pet. iv. 3. See note there. It emphasizes the violation of established order, being from the same root as Ti9npus, to Lay down or establish. The Jews pro- fessed to ground this prohibition on the law of Moses ; but there is no direct command in the Mosaic law forbidding Jews to as- sociate with those of other nations. But Peter’s statement is general, referring to the general practice of the Jews to sepa- rate themselves in common life from uncircumcised persons. Juvenal says that the Jews were taught by Moses “not to show the way except to one who practises the same rites, and to guide the circumcised alone to the well which they seek” (Sat., xiv., 104, 105). Tacitus also says of the Jews that “ among themselves they are inflexibly faithful, and ready with charitable aid, but hate all others as enemies. They keep separate from all strangers in eating, sleeping, and matrimonial connections ” (‘‘ Histories,” v., 5).   Of another nation (4AXoftA@). Only here in New Testa- ment.

And  Menander:  \"The  door of  the  court  is  the  boundary  fixed  for  the  free  woman.\"  The head-dress  of  Greek  women  consisted  of  nets,  hair-bags,  or  ker- chiefs, sometimes  covering  the  whole  head.  A  shawl  which enveloped  the  body  was  also  often  thrown  over  the  head,  es- pecially at  marriages  or  funerals.  This  costume  the  Corinthian women  had  disused  in  the  christian  assemblies,  perhaps  as  an assertion  of  the  abolition  of  sexual  distinctions,  and  the  spirit- ual equality  of  the  woman  with  the  man  in  the  presence  of Christ.  This  custom  was  discountenanced  by  Paul  as  striking at  the  divinely  ordained  subjection  of  the  woman  to  the  man. Among  the  Jews,  in  ancient  times,  both  married  and  unmarried women  appeared  in  public  unveiled.  The  later  Jewish  authori- ties insisted  on  the  use  of  the  veil.  All  one  as  if  she  were  shaven.  Which  would  be  a  sign either  of  grief  or  of  disgrace.  The  cutting  off  of  the  hair  is used  by  Isaiah  as  a  figure  of  the  entire  destruction  of  a  people by  divine  retribution.  Isa.  vii.  20.  Among  the  Jews  a  woman convicted  of  adultery  had  her  hair  shorn,  with  the  formula : \"  Because  thou  hast  departed  from  the  manner  of  the  daughters of  Israel,  who  go  with  their  head  covered,  therefore  that  has befallen  thee  which  thou  hast  chosen.\"  According  to  Tacitus, among  the  Germans  an  adulteress  was  driven  from  her  hus- band's house  with  her  head  shaved ;  and  the  Justinian  code  pre- scribed this  penalty  for  an  adulteress,  whom,  at  the  expiration  of two  years,  her  husband  refused  to  receive  again.  Paul  means that  a  woman  praying  or  prophesying  uncovered  puts  herself in  public  opinion  on  a  level  with  a  courtesan.  6.  Shorn  or  shaven  {fceipaa^tu  ^  ^paaSai).

In  the  case  of  the  woman,  the word  image  is  omitted,  although  she,  like  the  man,  is  the  image of  God.  Paul  is  expounding  the  relation  of  the  woman,  not  to God,  but  to  man.   248  WORD  STUDIES  IN   THE   NEW  TESTAMENT.  (Cb.  XL  10.  Power  on  Ler  head  (efouffiaf).

The  emphasis  is  on Zord^s.  Aehrvov  svpper^  represented  the  principal  meal  of  the day,  answering  to  the  late  dinner.  The  Eucharist  proper  was originally  celebrated  as  a  private  expression  of  devotion,  and  in connection  with  a  common,  daily  meal,  an  agape  or  love-feaet. In  the  apostolic  period  it  was  celebrated  daily.  The  social  and festive  character  of  the  meal  grew  largely  out  of  the  gentile institution  of  clubs  or  fraternities,  which  served  as  savings- banks,  mutual-help  societies,  insurance  oflSces,  and  which  ex- pressed and  fostered  the  spirit  of  good-fellowship  by  common festive  meals,  usually  in  gardens,  round  an  altar  of  sacrifice. The  communion-meal  of  the  first  and  second  centuries  exhibited this  character  in  being  a  feast  of  contribution,  to  which  each brought  his  own  provision.  It  also  perpetuated  the  Jewish practice  of  the  college  of  priests  for  the  temple-service  dining at  a  common  table  on  festivals  or  Sabbatlis,  and  of  the  schools of  the  Pharisees  in  their  ordinary  life.  Indications  of  the  blending  of  the  encharistic  celebration  with a  common  meal  are  found  here,  Acts  ii.  42 ;  xx.  7,  and  more obscurely,  xxvii.  35.*  21.  Taketh  before  other.

And  so  those  who  had brought  much  were  ashamed  not  to  partake  of  that  which  was placed  for  general  use,  and  not,  in  return,  to  place  their  own stock  on  the  tabic  (\"Memorabilia,\"  iii.,  14, 1).  23.

Strictly,  wtto  from  or  of,  witli the  LoT'd,  would  imply  the  more  remote  source,  from  the  Lord, through  the  apostles;  but  Paul  does  not  always  observe  the distinction  between  this  and  trapd  from,  the  preposition  of  the nearer  source  (see  Greek,  Col.  i,  7 ;  iii.  24);  and  this  latter preposition  compounded  with  the  verb  received,  the  emphatic  /, and  the  mention  of  the  fact  itself,  are  decisive  of  the  sense  of an  immediate  communication  from  Christ  to  Paul.*  Also  {koX}.

Such also  is  the  primary  meaning  of  discern  {discemere  to  part  or separate)^  so  that  discerning  implies  a  mental  act  of  discrim- inating between  different  things.

III. Recorded  facts  in  the  Nkw  TEBTAKE^fT.  (1.)  The  first  re- corded bestowment  of  tlie  gift  was  at  Pentecost  (Acts  ii,).    Tlie   J   Oil  XU.]       THB  FIRST  EPISTLB  TO  THB  CORINTHIANS.  257  question  arises  whether  the  speakers  were  miraculously  en- dowed to  speak  witli  other  tongues,  or  whether  the  Spirit  in- terpreted the  apostle's  words  to  each  in  his  own  tongue.  Prob- ably the  latter  was  the  case,  since  there  is  no  subsequent  notice of  the  apostles  preaching  in  foreign  tongues;  there  is  no  allusion to  foreign  tongues  by  Peter,  nor  by  Joel,  whom  he  quotes.  This fact,  moreover,  would  go  to  explain  the  opposite  effects  on  the hearers.  (2.)  Under  the  power  of  the  Spirit,  the  company  ad- dressed by  Peter  in  the  house  of  Cornelius  at  Caesarea  spake with  tongues.  Acts  x.  11  16.  (3.)  Certain  disciples  at  Ephe- sus,  who  received  the  Iloly  Spirit  in  the  laying  on  of  Paul's hands,  spake  with  tongues  and  prophesied.  Acts  xix.  6.  IV. Meaning  of  the  term  ^^tonque.\"  The  various  explanations are :  tlie  tongue  alone^  inartictUately :  rare^  provincialy  poetic^ or  archaic  words  :  langiMge  or  dialect.  The  last  is  the  correct definition.  It  does  not  necessarily  mean  any  of  the  known  lan- guages of  men,  but  may  mean  the  speaker's  own  tongue,  shaped in  a  peculiar  manner  by  the  Spirit's  influence ;  or  an  entirely new  spiritual  language.  V.  Nature  of  the  gift  in  the  Corinth- ian Chitroh.  (1.)  The  gift  itself  was  identical  with  that  at Pentecost,  at  Caesarea,  and  at  Ephesns,  but  differed  in  its  man- ifestations, in  that  it  required  an  interpreter.  1  Cor.  xii.  10, SO  ;  xiv.  6, 13,  26, 27.  (2.)  It  was  closely  connected  with  proph- esying :  1  Cor.  xiv.  1-6,  22,  25 ;  Acts  ii.  16-18 ;  xix.  6.  Com- pare 1  Thess.  V.  19,  20.  It  was  distinguished  from  prophesying as  an  inferior  gift,  1  Cor.  xiv.  4,  5 ;  and  as  consisting  in  ex- pressions of  praise  or  devotion  rather  than  of  exhortation,  warn- ing, or  prediction,  1  Cor.  xiv.  14r-16.  (3.)  It  was  an  ecstatic utterance,  unintelligible  to  the  hearers,  and  requiring  interpre- tation, or  a  corresponding  ecstatic  condition  on  the  part  of  the hearer  in  order  to  understand  it.  It  was  not  for  the  edification of  the  hearer  but  of  the  speaker,  and  even  the  speaker  did  not always  understand  it,  1  Cor.  xiv.  2,  19.  It  therefore  impressed unchristian  bystanders  as  a  barbarous  utterance,  the  effect  of madness  or  drunkenness,  Acts  ii.  13,  15;  1  Cor.  xiv.  11,  23. Hence  it  is  distinguished  from  the  utterance  of  the  understand- ing, 1  Cor.  xiv.  4,  14r-16,  19,  27.  VI.  Paul's  j^stimate  of  Tire gift.  lie  himself  was  a  master  of  the  gift  (1  Cor.  xiv.  18),  but Vol.  m.— 17   25b  word  studies  in  THB  new  TKSTAMBNT,        (fa.

Being  recognized  distinctly  as  a  gift  of  t)je  Spiiit, it  must  be  inferred  that  it  contributed  in  some  way  to  tlie  edifi- cation of  tlie  Church ;  but  it  led  to  occasional  disorderly  out- breaks (1  Cor.  xiv.  9,  11,  17,  20-23,  26-28,  33,  40).  Ae  a  fact it  soon  passed  away  from  the  Church.  It  is  not  mentioned  in the  Catholic  or  Pastoral  Epistles.  A  few  allusionB  to  it  occur in  the  writings  of  the  fathers  of  the  second  century.  Ecstatic conditions  and  manifestations  marked  the  Montanists  at  the close  of  the  second  century,  and  an  account  of  such  a  case,  in which  a  woman  was  the  subject,  is  given  by  Tertullian.  Simi- lar phenomena  have  emerged  at  intervals  in  various  sects,  at times  of  great  religious  excitement,  as  among  the  Camisards  in France,  the  early  Quakers  and  MetLodists,  and  especially  the Irvingites.*  13.  Made  to  drink  (^oWtr^^i').  The  verb  means  origin- ally to  give  to  drink,  fi-om  which  comes  the  sense  of  to  water or  irrigfUe.  The  former  is  invariably  the  sense  in  the  gospels and  Apocalypse ;  the  latter  in  1  Cor.  iii.  6~S,  and  by  some  here. The  reference  is  to  the  reception  of  the  Spirit  in  baptism. Omit  into  before  orte  Spirit.  14.  The  body.

Plato relates how Pluto complained to Zeus that the souls of the dead found their way to the wrong places, be- cause the judged have their clothes on, and evil souls are clothed in fair bodies, so that the judges, who also have their clothes on and their souls veiled by their mortal part, are de- ceived. Zeus replies: “In the first place, I will deprive men of the foreknowledge of death which they now have. In the second place, they shall be entirely stripped before they are judged, for they shall be judged when they are dead; and the judge, too, shall be naked ; that is to say, dead. He, with his naked soul, shall pierce into the other naked soul, and they shall die suddenly and be deprived of all their kindred, and leave their brave attire strewn upon the earth ” (“‘ Gorgias,” 523).   22.

Herodotus speaks of one who was of the same heeght (jAccujv) with another (iii. 16). But both the usage and the connection are in favor of the meaning age. A measure of time is sometimes represented by a measure of length, as in Ps. xxxix. 5; but, most of all, the addition of a cubit (a foot and a half) to one’s stature would not be a smali one, as the text im- plies (that which és least), buta very large one.

This is its sense in the only other pas- sage where it occurs, Philip. i. 23, “having a desire to depart, or break up; the metaphor being drawn from breaking up an encampment.” Compare departure (avadicews), 2 Tim. iv. 6. The rendering return is a kind of inference from this: when he shall leave the wedding and return.   372 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XII.   Wedding (rar yapor).

The A. V. does not translate yap, for. Rev., correctly, for as thouart going. Their own judgment should show them the necessity of repentance toward God; and this duty is urged under the figure of a debtor who meets his creditor in the way, and whose best policy it is to make terms on the spot.   374 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.

These three years | come. The best texts insert ad’ od, Srom which, or since. “It is three years from the time at which I came.”   Cut it down (éxxowov). Rather, “cut it owt” (é«) from among the other trees and the vines.   Why cumbereth it. The A. V. omits the very important rai, also (Rev.), which, as Trench observes, is the key-word of the sentence. Besides being barren in itself, it adso injures the soil. “ Not only is it unfruitful, but it draws away the juices which the vines would extract from the earth, intercepts the sun, and occupies room” (Bengel). The verb cumbereth (xar- apyet) means to make of no effect. So Rom. iii. 3, 31; Gal. iii. 17. Cumbereth expresses the meaning in a very general and comprehensive way. The specific elements included in it are expressed by Bengel above. De Wette, makes the land un- Sruitful. See on barren and unfruitful, 2 Pet. i. 8.   Cx. XIII] LUKE. 375   9. And if it bear fruit, well ; and if not, then after that. Join after that with bear fruct. “If it bear fruit for the future (eis TO péAXOv, Rev., thenceforth), well; but if not, thou shalt cut it down.” ‘Trench (“ Parables”) cites an Arabian writer’s receipt for curing a palm-tree of barrenness. ‘‘ Thou must take a hatchet, and go to the tree with a friend, unto whom thou sayest, ‘1 will cut down this tree, for it is unfruitful.’ He an- swers, ‘Do not so, this year it will certainly bear fruit’ But the other says, ‘It must needs be—it must be hewn down ;’ and gives the stem of the tree three blows with the back of the hatchet. But the other restrains him, crying, ‘ Nay, do it not, thou wilt certainly have fruit from it this year, only have patience with it, and be not overhasty in cutting it down ; if it still refuses to bear fruit, then cut it down.’ Then will the tree that year be certainly fruitful and bear abundantly.” Trench adds that this story appears to be widely spread in the East.   Thou shalt cut it down. The vine-dresser does not say, « J will cut,” but refers that to the master.   11. Spirit of infirmity. A spirit which caused infirmity. An evil demon, see ver. 16, though it is not certain that it was a case of possession. The details of the disease, and the noting of the time of its continuance, are characteristic of a physician’s narrative.   Bowed together (cuvyxirrovea). Only here in New Testa- ment.

Compare with you (ue¥ tuav), Matt. xxvi. 29.   27.1 know not whence. “The sentence is fixed, but it is repeated with emphasis” (Bengel).   Shall sit down (avaxXIjcovras). Sit down at table. Jesus casts his thought into a familiar Jewish image. According to the Jewish idea, one of the main elements of the happiness of the Messianic kingdom was the privilege of participating in splendid festive entertainments along with the patriarchs of the nation. With this accords ver. 30, in allusion to places at the banquet. Compare ch. xiv. 7-9; Matt. xxiii. 6.   31. Day. The best texts read hour.   Will kill (9éXeu azroxretvar). As in so many cases the A. V. renders as the future of the verb ¢o Kill ; whereas there are two distinct verbs; to will or determine, and to kill. The meaning is, Herod willeth or is determined to kill thee. Rev., would fain, seems rather feeble.   32. That fox. Herod. Describing his cunning and cow- ardice.   Cures (idcews). Used by Luke only.   378 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XIV.   I shall be perfected (rerecoduar). The present tense: “ the present of the certain future” (Meyer). The meaning is, 7 come to an end: I have done. Expositors differ greatly. Some interpret, “I end my career of healing,” etc. ; others, my life.   33. It cannot be (ov« évdéyera). The verb means to accept or admit ; so that the sense is, “ it is not admisszble that.” The expression is ironical and hyperbolical, with reference to Jeru- salem as having a monopoly of such martyrdoms. “It would be contrary to use and wont, and, in a manner, to theocratic de- corum, if such a prophet as I should perish elsewhere than in Jerusalem ” (Godet).   34.

This servant often repeats the very formula mentioned in Luke xiv. 17: Come, for the supper is ready. The fact that this custom is confined to the wealthy and to the nobility is in strict agree- ment with the parable, where the man who made the supper is supposed to be of this class. It is true now, as then, that to re- fuse is a high insult to the maker of the feast (Thomson, “ Land and Book”). Palgrave mentions a similar formula of invitation among the Bedouins of Arabia. “The chief, or some un- breeched youngster of his family, comes up to us with the cus- tomary tefaddaloo, or do us the favor” (Central and Hastern Arabia ”’).   18.

We know from Tertullian that it was often designed upon chalices. We find it ourselves painted in fresco upon the roofs and walls of the sepulchral chambers ; rudely scratched upon gravestones, or more carefully sculptured on sarcophagi; traced in gold upon glass, moulded on lamps, engraved on rings; and, in a word, represented on every species of Christian monument that has come down to us.

Some- times he stands amidst many sheep; sometimes he caresses one only ; but most commonly—so commonly as almost to form a rule to which other scenes might be considered the exceptions —he bears a lost sheep, or even a goat, upon his shoulders 3 (Northcote and Brownlow, “Roma Sotteranea”). A beautiful specimen is found in the mausoleum of Galla Placidia, at Ravenna, erected about 450 a.v. It is a mosaic in green and gold. The figure is a beautiful one, youthful in face and form, as is usual in the early mosaics, and surrounded by his sheep. Facing this appears, over the altar, the form of Christ seated beside a kind of furnace, on the other side of which stands a little open bookcase.

In the one case, the attention is fastened on the condition of the thing lost; in the other, upon the sorrow of the one who has lost.   12. The portion. According to the Jewish law of inheri- tance, if there were but two sons, the elder would receive two portions, the younger the third of all movable property. A man might, during his lifetime, dispose of all his property by gift as he chose. If the share of younger children was to be dimin- ished by gift or taken away, the disposition must be made by a person presumably near death. No one in good health could diminish, except by gift, the legal portion of a younger son. The younger son thus was entitled by law to his share, though he had no right to claim it during his father’s lifetime. The request must be regarded as asking a favor (Kdersheim).   Unto them.

Imperfect tense, he was longing, all the while he was tending the swine.   Filled his belly (yeuioas tHv xovdAav). The texts vary. The Rev. follows the reading yopracdjvar, “He would fain have been filled,” using the same word which is employed of filling those who hunger and thirst after righteousness (Matt. v. 6, see note), and of the five thousand (Matt. xiv. 20). Hehad wanted the wrong thing all along, and it was no better now. All he wanted was to fill his belly.   Husks (xepatiwv). Carob-pods. The word is a diminutive of xépas, a horn, and means, literally, a little horn, from the shape of the pod. The tree is sometimes ealled in German Bockshornbaum, Goat’s-horn-tree. ‘The fleshy pods are from six to ten inches long, and one broad, lined inside with a ge- Jatinous substance, not wholly unpleasant to the taste when thoroughly ripe” (Thomson, “ Land and Book”). The shell or pod alone is eaten. It grows in Southern Italy and Spain, and it is said that during the Peninsular War the horses of the British cavalry were often fed upon the pods. It is also called   Cu. XV.] uUKE. 387   Saint John’s bread, from a tradition that the Baptist fed upon its fruit in the wilderness. Edersheim quotes a Jewish saying, “When Israel is reduced to the carob-tree, they become repent- ant.”   17. Came to himself. A striking expression, putting the state of rebellion against God as a kind of madness. It isa won- derful stroke of art, to represent the beginning of repentance as the return of a sound consciousness. Ackermann (“ Christian Element in Plato”) observes that Plato thinks of redemption as a coming to one’s self ; an apprehending of one’s self as existent ; as a severing of the inmost being from the surrounding element. Several passages of Plato are very suggestive on this point. “ He who bids a man know himself, would have him know his soul ” (“ Alcibiades,” i., 130). ‘To see her (the soul) as she really is, not as we now behold her, marred by communion with the body and other miseries, you should look upon her with the eye of reason, in her original purity, and then her beauty would be discovered, and in her image justice would be more clearly seen, and injustice, and all the things which we have described. Thus far we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present; but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a condition which may be compared to that of the sea-god Glaucus, whose original image can hardly be discerned, because his natural members are broken off and crushed, and in many ways damaged by the waves; and in- crustations have grown over them of sea-weed and shells and stones, so that he is liker to some sea-monster than to his nat- ural form. And the soul is in a similar condition, disfigured by ten thousand ills: but not there, Glaucon, not there must we look.’  «<¢ Where, then ?’  “¢ At her love of wisdom. Let us see whom she affects, and what converse she seeks, in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal and eternal and divine; also, how different she would become, if wholly following this superior principle, and borne by a divine impulse out of the ocean in which she now is, and disengaged from the stones and shells and things of earth and   388 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.

To be called thy son. He omits make me a servant. The slavish spirit vanishes in the clasp of the father’s arms. Bengel suggests that the father would not suffer him to utter the news. I once heard Norman McLeod say in a sermon, “ Before the prodigal son reached his home he thought over what he should do to merit restoration. He would be a hired servant. But when his father came out and met him, and put his arms round him, and the poor boy was beginning to say this and that, he just shut his mouth, and said, ‘I take you to my heart, and that’s enough.’”   22.

The return of the penitent is the point most frequently chosen, but the dissipation in the far country and the degradation among the swine are also treated. The dissipation is the subject of an interesting picture by the younger Teniers in the gallery of the Louvre. The prodigal is feasting at a table with two courte- sans, in front of an inn, on the open shutter of which a tavern- score is chalked. An old woman leaning on a stick begs alms, possibly foreshadowing the fate of the females at the table. The youth holds out his glass, which a servant fills with wine. In the right-hand corner appears a pigsty where a stable-boy is feeding the swine, but with his face turned toward the table, as if in envy of the gay revellers there. All the costumes and other details of the picture are Dutch. Holbein also represents him feasting with his mistress, and gambling with a sharper who is sweeping the money off the table. The other points of the story are introduced into the background. Jan Steen paints him at table in a garden before an inn. A man plays the guitar, and two children are blowing bubbles—“ an allegory of the transient pleasures of the spendthrift.” Mrs. Jameson remarks that the riotous living is treated principally by the Dutch painters. The life among the swine is treated by Jordaens in the Dresden Gallery. The youth, with only a cloth about his loins, ap-   390 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu.

In the left-hand corner a young boor is playing on a pipe, a sorrowful contrast to the delicious music of the halls of pleasure. Salvator Rosa pictures him in a land- scape, kneeling with clasped hands amid a herd of sheep, oxen, goats, and swine. Rubens, in a farm-stable, on his knees near a trough, where a woman is feeding some swine. He looks im- ploringly at the woman. One of the finest examples of the treatment of the return is by Murillo, in the splendid picture in the gallery of the Duke of Sutherland. It is thus described by Stirling (“Annals of the Artists of Spain”): “The repentant youth, locked in the embrace of his father, is, of course, the principal figure ; his pale, emaciated countenance bespeaks the hardships of his husk-coveting time, and the embroidery on his tattered robe the splendor of his riotous living. A little white dog, leaping up to caress him, aids in telling the story. On one side of this group a man and a boy lead in the fatted calf ; on the other appear three servants bearing a light-blue silk dress of Spanish fashion, and the gold ring; and one of them seems to be murmuring at the honors in preparation for the lost one.”   25.

The father, in the midst of all his natural affection, is yet full of the moral significance of his son’s return—that he has come back another person from what he was when he went, or while he tarried in that far land; he sees into the deep of his joy, that he is receiving him now indeed a son, once dead but now alive; once lost to him and to God, but now found alike by both. But the servant confines himself to the more external features of the case, to the fact that, after all he has gone through of excess and hardship, his father has yet received him safe and sound” (Trench).

That  the  point  of  the  passage  ia  a  warning  against  !in  undue self-estimate,  and  a  corresponding  exhortation  to  estimate  one's self  with  discrimination  and  sober  judgment.  2.  That  Paul has  a  standard  by  whlcli  self-estimate  is  to  be  regulated.  This ia  expressed  liy  w  as,  according  as.  3.  That  this  scale  or  meas- ure is  different  in  different  peraons,  so  that  the  line  between conceit  and  sober  thinking  ia  not  the  same  for  all.

The  character  of  this  measure  or  standard  is  de- termined by  faiih.  It  mnst  be  observed  that  the  general  ex- hortation to  a  proper  self-estimate  is  shaped  by,  and  fore* shadows,  tlie  subsequent  words  respecting  difEerences  of  gifts* It  was  at  this  point  that  the  tendency  to  self-conceit  and  spirit* ual  arrogance  'would  develop  itself.  Hence  the  precise  defini- tion oi  faith  here  will  be  affected  by  its  relation  to  the  differing gifts  in  ver.  6.  Its  meaning,  therefore,  must  not  be  strictly limited  to  the  conception  of  justifying  faith  in  Christ,  though that  conception  includes  and  is  really  the  basis  of  every  wider conception.  It  is  faith  as  the  condition  of  the  powers  and  of- fices of  believers,  faith  regarded  as  spiritual  insight,  which,  ac- cording to  its  degree,  qualifies  a  man  to  be  a  prophet,  a  teacher, a  minister,  etc. ;  faith  in  its  relation  to  character,  as  the  only principle  which  develops  a  man's  true  character,  and  which, therefore,  is  the  determining  principle  of  the  renewed  man's tendencies,  whether  they  lead  him  to  meditation  and  research, or  to  practical  activity.  As  faith  is  the  sphere  and  subjective condition  of  the  powers  and  functions  of  believers,  so  it  furn- ishes a  test  or  regulative  standard  of  their  respective  endow- ments and  functions.  Thus  the  measure  applied  is  distinctively a  measure  of  faith.  With  faith  the  believer  receives  a  power of  discernment  as  to  the  actual  limitations  of  his  gifts.  Faith, in  introducing  him  into  God^s  kingdom,  introduces  him  to  new standards  of  measurement,  according  to  which  he  accurately determines  the  nature  and  extent  of  his  powers,  and  so  does not  think  of  himself  too  highly.  This  measure  is  different  in different  individuals,  but  in  every  case  faith  is  the  determining element  of  the  measure.  Paul,  then,  does  not  mean  precisely  to say  that  a  man  is  to  think  more  or  less  soberly  of  himself  ac- cording to  the  quantity  of  faith  which  he  has,  though  that  is true  as  a  fact ;  but  that  sound  and  correct  views  as  to  the  char- acter and  extent  of  spiritual  gifts  and  functions  are  fixed  by  a measure,  the  determining  element  of  which,  in  each  particular ease,  is  faith.  4.

The  word  appears  in  the  New Testament  always  in  connection  with  the  service  of  the  Christ- ian Church,  except  Luke  x.  40,  of  Martha's  serving ;  Heb.  i.  14, of  the  ministry  of  angels,  and  2  Cor.  iii.  7,  of  the  ministry  of Moses.  Within  this  limit  it  is  used,  1.  Of  service  in  general^ including  all  forms  of  christian  ministration  tending  to  the good  of  the  christian  body  (1  Cor.  xii.  5  ;  £ph.  iv.  13 ;  2  Tim. iv.  11).  Hence,  2.  Of  the  apostolic  office  and  its  administra- tion; (a)  generally  (Acts  xx.  24;  2  Cor.  iv.  1;  1  Tim.  i.  12); or  (b)  defined  as  a  ministry  of  reconciliation,  of  the  word,  of  the Spirit,  of  righteousness  (2  Cor.  v.  18  ;  Acts  vi.  4 ;  2  Cor.  iiL  8, 9).  It  is  not  used  of  the  specific  office  of  a  deacon ;  but  tlie kindred  word  Sid/covo^  occurs  in  that  sense  (Philip,  i.  1 ;  1  Tim. iii.  8,  12).  As  the  word  is  employed  in  connection  with  both the  higher  and  lower  ministrations  in  the  Church  (see  Acts  vi. 1,  4),  it  is  difficult  to  fix  its  precise  meaning  here ;  yet  as  it  is distinguished  here  from  prophecy,  exhortation,  and  teaching,  it may  refer  to  some  more  practical,  and,  possibly,  minor  form  of ministry.  Moule  says :  ^'  Almost  any  work  other  than  that  of inspired  utterance  or  miracle-working  may  be  included  in  it here.\"  So  Godet :  \"  An  activity  of  a  practical  nature  exerted in  action,  not  in  word.\"     Some  limit  it  to  the  office  of  deacon.

The  verb  literally  means  being  carried  off  along  with;  hence yielding  or  auhmitting  to,  and  so  condescending.  Compare Gal.  ii.  13,  and  see  on  2  Pet.  iii.  17,  in  which  passages  it  has  s bud  sense  from  the  context.  According  to  the  original  sense, the  meaning  will  be,  being  led  awaywith  loicly  things  or  people  ; i.e.,  being  drawn  into  sympathy  with  them.  Farrar  suggests letting  the  lowly  lead  you  by  the  Jiand.

It occurs  once  in  Euripides,  meaning  a  stump  (\"Bacchae,\"  983). It  is  a  stake  for  a  palisade,  or  for  impaling ;  a  surgical  instru- ment ;  the  point  of  a  fish-hook.  la  the  Septuagint  it  occurs three  times,  translated  thorn  in  Hos.  ii.  6,  where,  however,  it  is distinguished  from  aKa.vSai<i  thorns  ;  brier  in  Ezek.  xxviii.  24, and  prick  in  Num.  xxxiii.  55,  Nine  different  Hebrew  words are  rendered  by  thorny  for  which,  in  the  great  majority  of  cases, Septuagint  gives  aKovSa.  The  rendering  t/toni  for  trKoXtn^  has no  support.  The  figure  is  that  of  the  inipaling-stake.  Herod- otus, alluding  to  this  punishment,  uses  (IcaemcoXoTriJeo'  {i.,  128; iii.,  132).  In  the  ninth  book  of  his  history,  Lampon  says  to Pansanias:  \"  When  Leonidas  was  slain  at  Thermopylae,  Xerxes and  Mardoniiis  beheaded  and  crucified  {avfOTavpattrav)  him. Do  thou  the  like  by  Mardonius,  ...  for  by  crucifying {avauTKo\\o-rr[(Ta<i)  thou  wilt  avenge  Leonidas \"  (ix.,  78).  The verb  seems,  therefore,  to  have  been  need  interchangeably  with crucify ;  and  clear  instances  of  this  occur  in  Fhilo  and  Liician.   A   Ch.  Xn.]      THB  SECOND  EPISTLE  TO  THE  GOBINTHIAN&  355  At  least  one  text  of  the  Septuagint  gives  ioHJuncoT^joiTrU^  in Esther  viL  10,  of  Haman's  being  hcmged.*  See  further,  on OaL  ii.  20.  The  explanations  of  the  peculiar  nature  of  this affliction  are  numerous.  Opinions  are  divided,  generally,  be- tween mental  or  spiritual  and  bodily  trials.  Under  the  former head  are  sensual  desires,  f aint-heartedness,  doubts,  temptations to  despair,  and  blasphemous  suggestions  from  the  devil.  Under the  latter,  persecution,  mean  personal  appearance,  headache, epilepsy,  earache,  stone,  ophthalmia.  It  was  probably  a  bodily malady,  in  the  flesh  /  but  its  nature  must  remain  a  matter  of conjecture.  Yery  plausible  reasons  are  given  in  favor  of  both epilepsy  and  ophthalmia.  Bishop  Lightfoot  inclines  to  the former,  and  Archdeacon  Farrar  thinks  that  it  was  almost  cert- ainly the  latter.f  Messenger  of  Satan  (0776X09  Xarav),  The  torment  is  thus personified.  Messenger  is  the  word  commonly  rendered  a/ngel in  the  New  Testament,  though  sometimes  used  of  human  mes- sengers, as  Luke  vii.  24,  27 ;  ix.  52 ;  Jas.  ii.  25 ;  see  also  on the  amgds  of  the  churches,  Apoc.  i.  20.  Messenger  and  Satan are  not  to  be  taken  in  apposition — a  messenger  who  was  Satan — because  Satan  is  never  called  arfyeXo^  in  the  New  Testament Messenger  is  figurative,  in  the  sense  of  agent.  Satan  is  con- ceived in  the  New  Testament  as  the  originator  of  bodily  evil. Thus,  in  the  gospel  narrative,  demoniac  possession  is  often  ac- companied with  some  form  of  disease.  Compare  Luke  ziiL  16 ; Acts  X.  38,  and  see  on  1  Cor.  v.  5.

Tlie force  of  the  perfect  tense  is  to  be  insisted  on.

Both classes of citizens were in possession of the same privileges, the principal of which were, exemption from scourging, freedom from arrest, except in extreme cases, and, in all cases, the right of appeal from the magistrate to the em- peror. The names of the colonists were still enrolled in one of the Roman tribes. The traveller heard the Latin language and was amenable to the Roman law. The coinage of the city had Latin inscriptions.

Python, in the Greek mythology, was the serpent which guarded Delphi. According to the legend, as related in the Homeric hymn, Apollo descended from Olympus in order to select a site for his shrine and oracle. Having fixed upon a spot on the southern side of Mount Parnassus, he found it guarded by a vast and terrific serpent, which he slew with an arrow, and suffered its body to rot (wvuJeiv) in the sun. Hence the name of the serpent Python (rotting); Pytho, the name of the place, and the epithet Pythian, applied to Apollo. The name Python was subsequently used to denote a prophetic de- mon, and was also used of soothsayers who practised ventrilo- quism, or speaking from the belly. The word éyyaorpiuv9os, ventriloquist, occurs in the Septuagint, and is rendered having a familiar spirit (see Levit. xix. 31; xx. 6, 27; 1 Sam. xxviii. 7, 8). The heathen inhabitants of Philippi regarded the woman as inspired by Apollo; and Luke, in recording this case, which came under his own observation, uses the term which would naturally suggest itself to a Greek physician, a Python- spirit, presenting phenomena identical with the convulsive movements and wild cries of the Pythian priestess at Delphi.      * Caria, the province adjoining Lydia on the south; Maeonia, the ancient name of Lydia.   532 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu XVL   Soothsaying (wavrevowévn). Akin to paivopas, to rave, in allusion to the temporary madness which possessed the priestess or sibyl while under the influence of the god. Compare Vir- gil’s description of the Cumaean Sibyl :   “¢ And as the word she spake Within the door, all suddenly her visage and her hue Were changed, and all her sleekéd hair and gasping breath she drew, And with the rage her wild heart swelled, and greater was she grown, Nor mortal-voiced ; for breath of god upon her heart was blown   As he drew nigher.” Aeneid, vi., 45 sq.   18.

Their usual name was duwm- viri, answering to the consuls of Rome; but they took pride in calling themselves otpatnyol, or practors, as being a more honorable title.

Who at this time were in special disgrace, having been lately banished from Rome by Claudius (see Acts xviii. 2). The Philippians do not appear to have recognized the distinc- tion between Christians and Jews.   21. Being Romans. The Romans granted absolute tolera- tion to conquered nations to follow their own religious customs, and took the gods of these countries under their protection. Otho, Domitian, Commodnus, and Caracalla were zealous parti- sans of the worship of Isis; Serapis and Cybele were patronized at Rome; and in the reign of Nero the religious dilettanti at Rome affected Judaism, and professed to honor the name of Moses and the sacred books. Poppaea, Nero’s consort, was   Cu. XVI] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 533   their patroness, and Seneca said, “the Jewish faith is now re- ceived on every hand. The conquered have given laws to the conquerors.” On the other hand, there were laws which for- bade the introduction of strange deities among the Romans themselves. In 186 z.c., when stringent measures were taken by the government for the repression of Bacchanalian orgies in Rome, one of the consuls, addressing an assembly of the people, said: “ How often in the ages of our fathers was it given in charge to the magistrates to prohibit the performance of any foreign religious rites; to banish strolling sacrificers and sooth- sayers from the forum, the circus, and the city ; to search for and burn books of divination; and to abolish every mode of sac- rificing that was not conformable to the Roman practice ” (Livy, xxxix., 16). It was contrary to strict Roman law for the Jews to propagate their opinions among the Romans, though they might make proselytes of other nations.   92. Rent off their clothes (epppyEavtes).

Some have supposed this to be the lower prison, being misled by the remains of the Mamertine prison at Rome, on the declivity of the Capitoline, and near the Arch of Septimius Severus. This consists of two chambers, one above the other, excavated in the solid rock. In the centre of the vault of the lower chamber is a circular opening, through which it is supposed that prisoners were let down into the dun- geon. Modern excavations, however, have shown that these two chambers were connected with a series of large chambers, now separated by an alley from the prison of St. Peter. The opening into the passage leading to these was discovered in the lower dungeon. Under this passage ran a drain, which formed   534 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. _[Cu. XVL   a branch of the Cloaca Maxima, or main sewer. Six of these chambers have been brought to light, evidently apartments of a large prison in the time of the Romankings. Mr. John Henry Parker, from whose elaborate work on the primitive fortifica- tions of Rome these details are drawn, believes that the prison of St. Peter now shown to tourists formed the vestibule and guard-room of the great prison. It was customary to have a vestibule, or house for the warder, at a short distance from the main prison. Thus he distinguishes the nner prison from this vestibule. With this agrees the description in the Rev. John Henry Newman’s “ Callista:” “The state prison was arranged on pretty much one and the same plan through the Roman empire, nay, we may say throughout the ancient world. It was commonly attached to the government buildings, and consisted of two parts. The first was the vestebule, or outward prison, approached from the praetorium, and surrounded by cells opening into it. The prisoners who were confined in these cells had the benefit of the air and light which the hall ad- mitted. From the vestibule there was a passage into the énte- rior prison, called Robur or Lignum, from the beams of wood which were the instruments of confinement, or from the char- acter of its floor. It had no window or outlet except this door, which, when closed, absolutely shut out light and air. This apartment was the place into which Paul and Silas were cast at Philippi. The utter darkness, the heat, and the stench of this miserable place, in which the inmates were confined day and night, is often dwelt upon by the martyrs and their biogra- phers.”   Stocks (fdAov).

The jailer bathed them; cleansing them from the blood with which they were besprinkled from the stripes.   34. Brought (avayayov).

They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans. Hackett remarks that “almost every word in this reply contains a distinct allegation. It would be difficult to find or frame a sentence superior to it in point of energetic brevity.” Cicero in his oration against Verres relates that there was a Roman citizen scourged at Messina; and that in the midst of the noise of the rods, nothing was heard from him but the words, “Iam a Roman citizen.” He says: “It is a dreadful deed to bind a Roman citizen; it is a crime to scourge him ; it is almost parricide to put him to death.”   40.

Popular prejudice, and the verdict of Grecian wisdom in its best age, asserted her natural inferior- ity. The Athenian law provided that everything which a man   Cu. XVIL) THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 537   might do by the counsel or request of a woman should be null in law. She was little better than a slave. To educate her was to advertise her as a harlot. Her companions were principally children and slaves. In Macedonia, however, monuments were erected to women by public bodies ; and records of male proper names are found, in Macedonian inscriptions, formed on the mother’s name instead of on the father’s. Macedonian women were permitted to hold property, and were treated as mistresses of the house. These facts are borne out by the account of Paul’s labors in Macedonia. In Thessalonica, Beroea, and Phi- lippi we note additions of women of rank to the church; and their prominence in church affairs is indicated by Paul’s spe- cial appeal to two ladies in the church at Philippi to reconcile their differences, which had caused disturbance in the church, and by his commending them to his colleagues as women who had labored with him in the Lord (Philip. iv. 2, 8).   5. Of the baser sort (@yopaiwv). From dyopd, the market- place ; hence loungers in the market-place; the rabble.

Another illustration of Luke’s accuracy. Note that the magistrates are called by a different name from those at Philippi. Thessaionica was nota colony, but a free city (see on colony, ch. xvi. 12), and was gov- erned by its own rulers, whose titles accordingly did not follow those of Roman magistrates. The word occurs only here and ver. 8, and has been found in an inscription on an arch at Thes- salonica, where the names of the seven politarchs are men- tioned. The arch is thought by antiquarians to have been standing in Paul’s time.   5388 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XVIL   7. Contrary to the decrees of Caesar. The charge at Philippi was that of introducing new customs; but as Thessa- lonica was not a colony, that charge could have no force there. The accusation substituted is that of treason against the em- peror; that of which Jesus was accused before Pilate. “The law of treason, by which the ancient legislators of the republic had sought to protect popular liberty from the encroachments of tyranny, . . . was gradually concentrated upon the em- peror alone, the sole impersonation of the sovereign people. The definition of the crime itself was loose and elastic, such as equally became the jealousy of a licentious republic or of a despotic usurper” (Merivale, “History of the Romans under the Empire”).   9.

The word, which occurs only here in the New Testament, and no- where in classical Greek, means full of idols. It applies to the city, not to the wmhabitants. “We learn from Pliny that at   Cu. XVIL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 5389   the time of Nero, Athens contained over three thousand public statues, besides a countless number of lesser images within the walls of private houses. Of this number the great majority were statues of gods, demi-gods, or heroes. In one street there stood before every house a square pillar carrying upon it a bust of the god Hermes. Another street, named the Street of the Tripods, was lined with tripods, dedicated by winners in the Greek national games, and carrying each one an inscription to a deity. Every gateway and porch carried its protecting god. Every street, every square, nay, every purlieu, had its sanctu- aries, and a Roman poet bitterly remarked that it was easier in Athens to find gods than men” (G. 8S. Davies, “St. Paul in Greece”).   18. Epicureans. Disciples of Epicurus, and atheists. They acknowledged God in words, but denied his providence and superintendence over the world. According to them, the soul was material and annihilated at death. Pleasure was their chief good; and whatever higher sense their founder might have attached to this doctrine, his followers, in the apostle’s day, were given to gross sensualism.   Stoics. Pantheists. God was the soul of the world, or the world was God. Everything was governed by fate, to which God himself was subject. They denied the universal and perpetual immortality of the soul; some supposing that it was swallowed up in deity; others, that it survived only till the final conflagration ; others, that immortality was restricted to the wise and good. Virtue was its own reward, and vice its own punishment. Pleasure was no good, and pain no evil. The name Stoic was derived from stoa, a porch.

Socrates was arraigned and condemned here on the charge of innovating on the state relig- ion. It received its name from the legend of the trial of Mars for the murder of the son of Neptune. The judges sat in the open air upon seats hewn out in the rock, on a platform ascended by a flight of stone steps immediately from the market-place. A temple of Mars was on the brow of the edifice, and the sanctu- ary of the Furies was in a broken cleft of the rock immediately below the judges’ seats. The Acropolis rose above it, with the Parthenon and the colossal statue of Athene. ‘It was a scene with which the dread recollections of centuries were associated. Those who withdrew to the Areopagus from the Agora, came, as it were, into the presence of a higher power.

The word means Zo have good opportunity; to have leisure : also, to devote one’s leesure to some- thing ; to spend the time. Compare Mark vi. 31; 1 Cor. xvi. 12.   Something new (te cawdrepov). Lit., newer: newer than that which was then passing current as new. The comparative was regularly used by the Greeks in the question what news ? They contrasted what was new with what had been new up to the time of asking. The idiom vividly characterizes the state of the Athenian mind. Bengel aptly says, ‘“‘ New things at once became of no account ; newer things were being sought for.” Their own orators and poets lashed them for this peculiarity. Aristophanes styles Athens the city of the gapers (“ Knights,” 1262). Demades said that the crest of Athens ought to be a great tongue. Demosthenes asks them, “ Is it all your care to go about up and down the market, asking each other, ‘ Is there any news?’” In the speech of Cleon to the Athenians, given by Thucydides (iii., 38), he says: “No men are better dupes, sooner deceived by novel notions, or slower to follow approved advice. You despise what is familiar, while you are worship- pers of every new extravagance. You are always hankering after an ideal state, but you do not give your minds even to what is straight before you. In a word, you are at the mercy of your own ears.”   22. | perceive (Jewpa). I regard you, in my careful obser- vation of you. See on Luke x. 18.   Too superstitious (Secvdaiwoveorépovs). This rendering and that of the Rev., somewhat superstitious, are both unfortu- nate. The word is compounded of de/Sa, to fear, and daipwv, a deity. It signifies either a religious or a superstitious sentiment, according to the context. Paul would have been unlikely to begin his address with a charge which would have awakened.   542 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. ([Cu. XVIL   the anger of his audience. What he means to say is, You are more divinity-fearing than the rest of the Greeks. This pro- pensity to reverence the higher powers is a good thing in itself, only, as he shows them, it is misdirected, not rightly conscious of its object and aim. Paul proposes to guide the sentiment rightly by revealing him whom they ignorantly worship. The American revisers insist on very religious. The kindred word derotOarpovia occurs ch. xxv. 19, and in the sense of religion, though rendered in A. V. superstition. Festus would not call the Jewish religion a superstition before Agrippa, who was him- self a Jew. There is the testimony of the Ephesian town-clerk, that Paul, during his three years’ residence at Ephesus, did not rudely and coarsely attack the worship of the Ephesian Diana. “Nor yet blasphemers of your goddess” (Acts xix. 37).   23.

An altar (Gwpov). Only here in New Testament, and the only case in which a heathen altar is alluded to. In all other cases Jvovactyprov is used, signifying an altar of the true God. The Septuagint translators commonly observe this distinction, being, in this respect, more particular than the Hebrew script- ures themselves, which sometimes interchange the word for the heathen altar and that for God’s altar. See, especially, Josh. xxii., where the altar reared by the Transjordanic tribes is called Bwpos, as being no true altar of God (vv. 10, 11, 16, 19, 23, a 34); and the legitimate altar, Suoweripiov (vv. 19, 28, 29).

XVIL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 543   altars, of which there were several in Athens, is a matter of conjecture. Hackett’s remarks on this point are sensible, and are borne out by the following words: ‘‘ whom therefore,” ete. “The most rational explanation is unquestionably that of those who suppose these altars to have had their origin in the feel- ing of uncertainty, inherent, after all, in the minds of the hea- then, whether their acknowledgment of the superior powers was sufficiently full and comprehensive; in their distinct conscious- ness of the limitation and imperfection of their religious views, and their consequent desire to avoid the anger of any still un- acknowledged god who might be unknown to them. That no deity might punish them for neglecting his worship, or remain uninvoked in asking for blessings, they not only erected altars to all the gods named or known among them, but, distrustful still lest they might not comprehend fully the extent of their subjection and dependence, they erected them also to any other god or power that might exist, although as yet unrevealed to them. . . . Under these circumstances an allusion to one of these altars by the apostle would be equivalent to his saying to the Athenians thus: ‘ You are correct in acknowledging a divine existence beyond any which the ordinary rites of your worship recognize ; there is such an existence. You are correct in con- fessing that this Being is unknown to you; you have no just conceptions of his nature and perfections.’ ”   lgnorantly (ayvoodvres). Rather, wnconsciously: not know- ing. There isa kind of play on the words unknown, knowing not. Jgnorantly conveys more rebuke than Paul intended.   Declare I (catayyéAXw). Compare catayyereds, setter-forth, in ver. 18. Here, again, there is a play upon the words.

Compare, also, Prov. xvii. 6, and see note on Jas. iii. 6. In the apocryphal books, of the universe, and mainly in the relation between God and it arising out of the creation. Thus, the hing of the world (2 Mace. vii. 9); the creator or founder of the world (2 Macc. vii. 23); the great potentate of the world (2 Mace. xii. 15). In the New Testa- ment: 1. In the classical and physical sense, the universe (John xvii. 5; xxi. 25; Rom. i. 20; Eph.i. 4, etc.). 2.

Stanley, speaking of the name by which the Deity is known in the patri- archal age, the plural “lohim, notes that Abraham, in per- ceiving that all the Hlohim worshipped by the numerous clans of his race meant one God, anticipated the declaration of Paul in this passage (“ Jewish Church,” i, 25). Paul’s statement strikes at the belief of the Epicureans, that the world was made by “‘a fortuitous concourse of atoms,” and of the Stoics, who denied the creation of the world by God, holding either that God animated the world, or that the world itself was God.   Made with hands (xeuporroujrois). Probably pointing to the magnificent temples above and around him. Paul’s epistles abound in architectural metaphors.

Pierced  {hv^ep).  Only  here  in  the  Kew  Testament.  The question  has  been  raised  whether  the  Evangelist  means  to  de- scribe a  gash  or  sl prick.  Another  verb  is  rendered  pierced  in ver.  37,  the  quotation  from  Zech.  xii.  10,  i^e/ehntfaa^v,  which occurs  also  at  Apoc.  i  7,  with  reference  to  Christ's  crucifixion, and  is  used  in  classical  Greek  of  putting  otU  the  eyes^  or  stabbingy and  in  the  Septuagint  of  Saul's  request  to  his  armor-bearer: \"  Draw  thj  sword  and  thrust  me  through  therewith  ^  (1  Chron. X.  4).  The  verb  used  here,  however,  vwram,  is  also  used  to describe  sevei'e  and  deadly  wounds,  as  in  Homer:  ^*  As  he  sprang Into  his  car,  Idomeneus,  expert To  wield  the  ponderous  javelin,  thmst  (w6f)  its  blade Through  his  right  shoulder.     From  the  oar  he  fell. And  the  dark  night  of  death  oame  over  him.**  \"Iliad,'' ▼.,  45-47,  It  has  been  suggested  that  the  body  was  merely  pricked  with the  spear  to  ascertain  if  it  were  yet  alive.  There  seems,  on  the whole,  no  reason  for  departing  from  the  ordinary  understanding of  the  narrative,  that  the  soldier  inflicted  a  degi>  thrust  on  the side  of  Jesus  (compare  xx.  25, 27);  nor  is  it  quite  apparent  why, as  Mr.  Field  urges,  a  distinction  should  be  kept  up  between  the two  verbs  in  vv.  34  and  37.*  Blood  and  water.  It  has  been  argued  very  plausibly  that this  was  a  natural  phenomenon,  the  result  of  a  rupture  of  the   *Mr.  Field  ('<OtiumKorTioen8e*')<'l<Linis  that  rv^vM,  is  the  milder  word, and  cites  a  onrious  illustration  from  Plutarch  (*'  Life  of  Cleomenes'*).  Cleo- ^menes  and  his  party  escape  from  prison,  and  endeavor  to  raise  the  town  and  to get  possession  of  the  citadel.  Failing  in  this,  they  resolve  npon  suicide.  It  is arranged  that  one  of  the  nnmher  is  not  to  kill  himself  nntil  he  shall  be  assnred that  all  the  rest  are  dead.

This  blood,  separated  into  its  thicker  and  more  liquid parts,  flowed  forth  when  the  pericardium  was  pierced  by  the spear.*  I  think,  however,  with  Meyer,  that  John  evidently  in- tends to  describe  the  incident  as  something  entirely  unexpected and  marvellous,  and  that  this  explanation  better  suits  the  solemn asseveration  of  ver.  35.  That  the  fact  had  a  symbolic  meaning to  the  Evangelist  is  evident  from  1  John  v.  6.  35.  He  that  8aw  it  bare  record  (6  impaK&^  ^fjMprvpfiKcv). Kev.,  rendering  the  perfect  tense  in  both  verbs,  he  that  haih seen  hath  home  tvUness.  This  can  refer  only  to  the  writer  of this  GospeL    Compare  1  John  L  1.  True  (aKff^ivff).  Genumej  according  to  the  true  ideal  of what  testimony  should  be.    See  on  1.  9.  And  he  {xa/cetvo^).  This  pronoun  is  urged  by  some  as  a reason  for  regarding  the  witness  as  some  other  than  John,  be- cause it  is  the  pronoun  of  remote  reference.  But  ix.  87  shows clearly  that  a  speaker  can  use  this  pronoun  of  himself ;  and  it is,  further,  employed  in  this  Grospel  to  indicate  a  person  ^'  as possessing  the  quality  which  is  the  point  in  question  in  an  emi- nent or  even  exclusive  degree''  (Godet).     See  i.  18 ;  v.  39.  True  (oXi^).  Lit,  true  things.  As  distinguished  from false.  Thus,  by  the  use  of  the  two  words  for  true^  there  are brought  out,  as  Westcott  remarks,  ^^  the  two  conditions  which testimony  ought  to  satisfy ;  the  first,  that  he  who  gives  it  should be  competent  to  speak  with  authority ;  and  the  second,  that  the account  of  his  experience  should  be  exact.\"  38.  A  disciple  of  Jeeus.  Matthew  calls  him  a  rich  man; Hark,  an  honorable  counsellor j  i.e.,  a  member  of  the  Sanhedrim; and  Luke,  a  counsellor^  good  and  just.  *  See  Wmiam  Stroud,  «  Physical  Theory  of  the  Death  of  ChriBt**   Digitized  by  VjOOQIC   GOSPEL  OF  JOHK.

Gave  him  leave.  According  to  Soman  law.  XJlpian,  a Boman  jurist  of  the  third  century,  sajs :  ''  The  bodies  of  those who  are  capitally  punished  cannot  be  denied  to  their  relatives. At  this  day,  however,  the  bodies  of  those  who  are  executed  are buried  only  in  case  permission  is  asked  and  granted ;  and  some- times permission  is  not  given,  especially  in  the  cases  of  those who  are  punished  for  high  treason.  The  bodies  of  the  executed are  to  be  given  for  burial  to  any  one  who  asks  for  them.\"  Avaric- ious governors  sometimes  sold  this  privilege.  Cicero,  in  one  of his  orations  against  Yerres,  has  a  terribly  graphic  passage  de- scribing such  extortions.  After  dwelling  upon  the  tortures  in- flicted upon  the  condemned,  he  says :  \"  Yet  death  is  the  end. It  shall  not  be.  Oan  cruelty  go  further?  A  way  shall  be  found. For  the  bodies  of  the  beheaded  shall  be  thrown  to  the  beasts. If  this  is  grievous  to  parents,  they  may  buy  the  liberty  of burial\"  (v.,  45).    Compare  Matt.  xiv.  12 ;  Acts  viii.  2.  89.  Came  Nicodemus — came  by  night.  The  contrast  is marked  between  his  first  and  his  second  coming.  Mixture  (jjUyfia).  Only  here  in  the  New  Testament  Some authorities  read  iKvyfia,  a  roll.  Pounds.  Boman  pounds,  of  nearly  twelve  ounces.  The large  quantity  may  be  explained  by  the  intention  of  covering the  entire  body  with  the  preparation,  and  by  the  fact  that  a portion  was  designed  for  the  couch  of  the  body  in  the  grave. Compare  the  account  of  the  burial  of  Asa,  2  Chron.  xvL  14. ^^Extraordinary  reverence  in  its  sorrowful  excitement  does  not easily  satisfy  itself ''  (Meyer).  40.  Linen  cloths  (oSovtoisi).    Used  only  by  John,  if  Luke xxiv.  12  is  rejected,  as  by  some  editors.

Spread  over  the  sheet  or  bandages  in which  the  body  was  wrapped.  The  manner  of  the  Jews.  As  contrasted  with  that  of  the Egyptians,  for  instance,  which  is  thus  described  by  Herodotus: \"  They  take  first  a  crooked  piece  of  iron,  and  witi  it  draw  out the  brains  through  the  nostrils,  thus  getting  rid  of  a  portion, while  the  skull  is  cleared  of  the  rest  by  rinsing  with  drugs ; next  they  make  a  cut  along  the  flank  with  a  sharp  Ethiopian stone,  and  take  out  the  whole  contents  of  the  abdomen,  which they  then  cleanse,  washing  it  thoroughly  with  palm-wine,  and again,  frequently  with  an  infusion  of  pounded  aromatics. After  this  they  fill  the  cavity  with  the  purest  bruised  myrrh, with  cassia,  and  every  other  sort  of  spicery  except  frankincense, and  sew  up  the  opening.  Then  the  body  is  placed  in  natrum (snbcarbonate  of  soda)  for  seventy  days,  and  covered  entirely over.  After  the  expiration  of  that  space  of  time,  which  must not  be  exceeded,  the  body  is  washed,  and  wrapped  round,  from head  to  foot,  with  bandages  of  fine  linen  cloUi,  smeared  over with  gum ''  (ii.,  86).  Or,  possibly,  a  contrast  may  be  implied with  the  Boman  custom  of  burning  the  bodies  of  the  dead. Tacitus  says  of  the  Jews :  ^^  The  bodies  of  the  deceased  they choose  rather  to  bury  than  bum,  following  in  this  the  Egyptian custom ;  with  whom  also  they  agree  in  their  attention  to  the dead ''(\"History,\"  v.,  6).  To  bury  {hn-atJHd^e^v).  Properly,  to  prepare  for  burial. See  on  xii.  7.  Compare  Septuagint,  Gen.  1.  2,  where  the  same word  is  used  for  embalmmff  the  body  of  Joseph.  41.  A  garden.    Mentioned  by  John  only.  New  (lecuviv).  See  on  Matt  xxvi.  29.

The phrase is synonymous with be accomplished (rerec Svar, Rev., fulfilled).

The proph- ecy is fulfilled ; the things concerning me are jinally settled.   39-46. Compare Matt. xxvi. 30, 36-46; Mark xiv. 26, 32-42.   40. The place. See on Gethsemane, Matt. xxvi. 36.   41.

Being in an agony (yevdpuevos év dywvia). There is in the aorist participle a suggestion of a growing imtensity in the struggle, which is not conveyed by the simple being. Literally, though very awkwardly, it is, having become in an agony : hav- ing progressed from the first prayer (began to pray, ver. 41) into an intense struggle of prayer and sorrow. Wycliffe’s rendering hints at this: and he, made in agony, prayed. Agony occurs only here. It is used by medical writers, and the fact of a sweat accompanying an agony is also mentioned by them.

The mention of the cause of the drowsi- ness is characteristic.   47-53. Compare Matt. xxvii. 47-56; Mark xiv. 43-52. 47. Multitude—one of the twelve. See on Matt. xxvi. 47.   To kiss.

I think the text requires that the words should be addressed to the disciples, and taken as the answer to the question, shall we smite, etc. The meaning then is, permit them to go so far as to seizeme.

A metaphor in constant use by Paul, and preserved in the words edify, edification (Latin, aedes, “a house,” and facere, “to make”) by which oixodouém and its kindred words are frequently rendered. In old English the word edify was used in its original sense of dbwild. Thus Wycliffe renders Gen. ii. 22, “The Lord God edzfied the rib which he took of Adam, into a woman.”  So, too, Spenser :   ‘*a little wide There was a holy temple edified.”’   Faerie Queene, i., 1, 34.   33.

He said (avrds eizre). Rev., more strictly, “ he homself said.” This saying of Jesus is not recorded by the Evangelists, and was received by Paul from oral tradition.  The speech of Paul to the Ephesian elders “ bears impressed on it the mark of Paul’s mind: its ideas, its idioms, and even its very words are Pauline; so much so as to lead Alford to ob- serve that we have probably the literal report of the words spoken by Paul. ‘It is, he remarks, ‘a treasure-house of words, idioms, and sentences peculiar to the apostle himself’ ”   (Gloag). 37.

The verb means to discover after search ; and the article, the disciples, refers to the disciples who lived and were recognized members of the church there. The A.

This suggests the case of Luther when on his journey to the Diet of Worms, and the story of Regulus the Roman, who, being permitted to return to Rome with an embassy from the Carthaginians, urged his coun- trymen to reject the terms of peace, and to continue the war, and then, against the remonstrances of his friends, insisted on fulfilling his promise to the Carthaginians to return in the event of the failure of negotiations, and went back to certain torture and death.   13. lam ready (éroluas éyw). Lit., 7 hold myself in readi- NESS.   15. Took up our carriages (arocxevacduevor). The verb means to pack up and carry off, oY simply to pack or store away.

Hence Rev., rightly, “(for them.” The person who thus paid the expenses of poor devotees who could not afford the neces- sary charges shared the vow so far that he was required to stay with the Nazarites until the time of the vow had expired. “For a week, then, St. Paul, if he accepted the advice of James and the presbyters, would have to live with four paupers in the chamber of the temple which was set apart for this pur- pose; and then to pay for sixteen sacrificial animals and the accompanying meat-offerings” (Farrar, “Life and Work of Paul”). He must also stand among the Nazarites during the offering of the sacrifices, and look on while their heads were shaved, and while they took their hair to burn it under the caldron of the peace-offerings, “and while the priest took four sodden shoulders of rams, and four unleavened cakes out of the four baskets, and four unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and put them on the hands of the Nazarites, and waved them for a wave-offering before the Lord” (Farrar).

The Jews evidently meant to create the impression that Paul had introduced Gen- tiles into the inner court, which was restricted to the Jews. The temple proper was on the highest of a series of terraces which rose from the outer court, or Court of the Gentiles. In this outer court any stranger might worship. Between this and the terraces was a balustrade of stone, with columns at intervals, on which Greek and Latin inscriptions warned all Gentiles against advancing farther on pain of death. Beyond this balustrade rose a flight of fourteen steps to the first platform, on which was the Court of the Women, surrounded by a wall. In this court were the treasury, and various chambers, in one of which the Nazarites performed their vows. It was here that the Asiatic Jews discovered Paul.   568 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.

These troops were quartered in the tower of Antonia, which was at the northwestern corner of the temple-area, and communicated with the temple-cloisters by staircases.   32. Centurions. See on Luke vii. 2. Unto them (ez avrovs). Better, wpon them.   33. Chains (advoeor). See on Mark v. 4.   34. Castle (mwapeuwPBoryjv). Better, barracks. The main tower had a smaller tower at each corner, the one at the south- eastern corner being the largest and overlooking the temple. In this tower were the quarters of the soldiers. The word is de- rived from the verb wapepSdrro, to put in beside, used in mil- itary language of distributing auxiliaries among regular troops and, generally, of drawing up in battle-order. Hence the noun means, @ body drawn up in batile-array, and passes thence into the meaning of an encampment, soldiers’ quarters, barracks. In Heb. xi. 34, it occurs in the earlier sense of an army ; and in Heb. xiii. 11, 13; Apoc. xx. 9, in the sense of an encampment. In grammatical phraseology it signifies a parenthesis, according to its original sense of ¢nsertzon or interpolation.   Cu. XX1] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 569   35. Stairs. Leading from the temple-court to the tower. There were two flights, one to the northern and the other to the western cloister, so that the guard could go different ways among the cloisters in order to watch the people at the Jewish festivals.   So it was (cvvé8n). Lit., zt happened. The verb means, lit- erally, to come together; hence, of a coincidence of events. It is designedly introduced here to express more vividly the fact of the peculiar emergency and the peril of Paul’s situation. Things came to such @ pass that he had to be carried up the stairs.   37. Canst thou speak (ywecxes). Lit., dost thou know ? So Rev.   38. Art thou not (ov« dpa od ¢i). Indicating the officer’s surprised recognition of his own mistake. “Thou art not, then, as I supposed.” Rev. properly adds then (apa).   The Egyptian. A false prophet, who, in the reign of Nero, when Felix was governor of Judaea, collected a multitude of thirty thousand, whom he led from the wilderness to the Mount of Olives, saying that the walls of Jerusalem would fall down at his command and give them free entrance to the city. Felix with an army dispersed the multitude, and the Egyptian him- self escaped. There is a discrepancy in the number of fol- lowers as stated by Josephus (30,000) and as stated by the commandant here (4,000). It is quite possible, however, that Josephus alludes to the whole rabble, while Lysias is referring only to the armed followers.   Madest an uproar. Better, as Rev., stirred up to sedition. The rendering of the A. V. is too vague. The verb means to unsettle or wpset, and the true idea is given in the A. V. of Acts xvii. 6, have turned the world upside down. Compare Gal. v. 12, and kindred words in Mark xv. 7; Luke Xxit. 19;   That were murderers (tev cixapiwv). The A. V. is too   570 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.  [Cu. XXIL   general, and overlooks the force of the article, which shows that the word refers toa class. Rev., rightly, the assassins. The word, which occurs only here, and notably on the lips of a Roman officer, is one of those Latin words which “followed the Roman domination even into those Eastern provinces of the em- pire which, unlike those of the West, had refused to be Latin- ized, but still retained their own language” (Trench, “Syn- onyms”). The Sicarii were so called from the weapon which they used—the séca, or short, curved dagger. J osephus says: “There sprang up in Jerusalem another description of robbers called Sikars, who, under the broad light of day, and in the very heart of the city, assassinated men; chiefly at the festivals, however, when, mixing among the crowd, with daggers con- cealed under their cloaks, they stabbed those with whom they were at variance. When they fell, the murderers joined in the general expressions of indignation, and by this plausible pro- ceeding remained undetected” (“Jewish War,” c. xiii.). The general New Testament term for murderer is goveds (see Matt. xxii. 7; Acts iii. 14; xxviii. 4, etc.).  39. Mean (donjpov). Lit., without a mark or token (cha). Hence used of uncoined gold or silver: of oracles which give no intelligible response: of inarticulate voices: of disease without distinctive symptoms. Generally, as here, wndestengueshed, mean. There is a conscious feeling of patriotism in Paul’s ex- pression.   40. Beckoned with the hand. Compare ch. xxvi. 1.   Tongue (d:aréxt@).

          "word_study": "  434 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.  [Cu. XXIV.   13. Threescore furlongs. Seven miles.   15. Went with (cuveropevero). The use of the imperfect here is very beautiful. Jesus drew near while they were ab- sorbed in their talk, and was already walking with them when they observed him.   17. Ve have (dvt:Bddrere). Lit., throw back and forth ; exchange.   ‘¢ Discussed a doubt and tossed it to and fro”? (Tennyson).   And are sad (cxv9pw7roi).. Only here and Matt. vi. 16, on which see note. The best texts put the interrogation point after walk, add Kal éord9noav, and render, and they stood still, looking sad. So Rev.   18. Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem (cd povos mapouxels Lepovoadnp). Ilapouxeiv, to dwell as a stranger, is used in later Greek of strangers who have no rights of citi- zenship, and no settled home. Compare Heb. xi. 9. See on strangers, 1 Pet.i. 1; and compare sojourning, 1 Pet. i. 17. The only of the A. V. is commonly understood adverbially : “ Are you nothing but a stranger?” But the emphasis of the question falls there, and the word is an adjective. Render “ Dost thou alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem?” Are you the only one who sojourns as a stranger in Jerusalem, and who does not know, ete. So, nearly, Wyc., Zhow alone art a pilgrim in Jerusalem.   18. What things (zoia). Lit., “ what kind of things.”   21. Trusted (jAmifouev). More correctly, hoped. Imper- fect: were hoping all the while.   Should have redeemed. Rev., more correctly, should re- deem (Autpovadar). See on 1 Pet. i. 18.   Beside all this (ctv waow tovrois). Lit., with all these things : his betrayal and crucifixion, ete.   Cu. XXIV.] LUKE. 435   To-day is the third day (tpirnv ravrnv nucpav dyes onpepor). The best texts omit to-day. The phrase forms an idiom which cannot be neatly rendered. Literally it is, “ He (Christ) is passing (aye) this day as the third.” Rev., Zé ts now the third day since, ete.   22. Made us astonished (é&éorncav). Literally the verb means to put out of place; and so, to drive one out of his senses. Hence the A. V. is feeble. Rev., better, amazed us.   Early (opdpwat). Lit., early ones. Only here and Apoc. xxii. 16. Compare ép9pos, dawn, ver. 1.   23. That they had seen—which said. Cleopas, absorbed in his story, throws himself back to the time of his interview with the women. Lit., ‘“‘ They came saying that they have seen a vision of angels which say ” (Aéyoucwy).   25. Fools and slow of heart (avénroi nai Bpadeis TH xapdia). This is an unfortunate translation, in the light of the ordinary, popular use of the word fool. Jesus would never have called those sorrowful disciples foo/s in that sense. The word is com- pounded of 4, not, and voéw, which implies, besides seeing, per- ception of the mind as consequent upon sight. It is therefore equivalent to dull of perception. They had read what the prophets had spoken, but had failed to perceive its application to Christ. While this rebuke relates to the wnderstanding, the - following one, slow of heart, goes deeper, and contemplates the region of feeling and moral susceptibility. Your heart is dull and slow to respond to these testimonies of your own prophets. Compare hardness of heart, Mark xvi. 14.   All (émi wacw). Rev., rightly, am all ; relying upon (éré) all the utterances of the prophets.   26. Ought not (ovyi éée). The A. V. does not convey the precise meaning, which is, that, in the eternal order of things, and in fulfilment of the eternal counsel of God as expressed in   436 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.  [Cu. XXIV.   the prophecies, it was essentially fitting that Christ should suffer. Rev. is clumsy but correct: behoved at not the Christ to suffer ?   27. He expounded (Siepyrvvev). Or interpreted : through- out (Sud). Imperfect, he went on interpreting from passage to passage.   28. They went (ézopevovro). Imperfect, were going. So Rev.   Made as though (spoceroujoato). The verb means origi- nally to add or attach to; hence to take to one’s self what does not belong to him; and s0, to pretend ; though pretending as implying anything false, does not attach to this act of Jesus. He was going on, and would have gone on but for their invita- tion. Only here in New Testament.   29. They constrained (aapeBiacavt0). Contrary to (rapa) his apparent intention of goingon. Only here and Acts xvi. 15.   Is far spent («é«duxev). Lit., has declined. Wyc., 1s now bowed down.   30. And gave (ézreSiSov). A very beautiful use of the im- perfect, indicating that while he was in the act of distributing they recognized him. He blessed, and having broken, was giv- ing it to them, when, in an instant, their eyes were opened (aorist tense).   31. They knew (érréyvwoav). Clearly recognized.   And he vanished out of their sight (atdros ddavtos éyévero ar avtav). Lit., he, invisible, became away from them. It is not simply, he suddenly departed from them, but he passed away from them invisibly. The éyévero, became, is construed with am’ avrav, from them.*      * Not &avros abrots, became invisible to them, which would imply that his body remained, but invisibly ; but ax airav, away from them, implying a real removal (Beza, cited by Alford and Meyer).   Cu. XXIV.] LUKE. 437   32. Did not our heart burn—while he talked—opened. (odyi 1) xapdia jhpav Karopéevn Tv—as éAdrer—Ounvouyev). The A. V., as usual, pays no attention to the graphic imperfects here. They are speaking of something which was in progress: “ was not our heart burning (finite verb and participle) while he was speaking, and was opening the scriptures ¢”   34. Is risen (yé997)—appeared (89). Bothaorists. The Lord rose and appeared. So Wye. See on appeared, ch.   xxii. 43.   35. They told (é&nyoivr0). Rev., rehearsed is better, be- cause the verb means to ted at length or relate in full.   36. Jesus himself. The best texts omit Jesus. Render as Reyv., “ he himself stood.”   And saith unto them, Peace be unto you. The best texts omit.   38. Thoughts (Suaroyicpol). See on Jas. ii. 4, and decewing, Jas. i. 22. Rev., reasonings. Asif he had said, “ Why do you reason about a matter which your spiritual perception ought to discern at once.” Compare note on fools, ver. 25.*   39. Handle (nAradijoate). Compare 1 John i.1. The word occurs also Acts xvii. 27; Heb. xii. 18. “It never ex- presses the so handling an object as to exercise a moulding, modifying influence upon it, but at most a feeling of its sur- face; this, it may be, with the intention of learning its com- position (Gen. xxvii. 12, 21, 22); while, not seldom, it signifies      * Reasonings, doubtings, scruples, are more or less distinctly implied in every occurrence of the word in the New Testament. In Phil. ii. 14, disputings (Rev. ) is, as Meyer observes, unsuitable to the reference of murmurings to God, and means rather scrupulous considering or hesitations, indicating uncertainty in the consciousness of duty. So in 1 Tim. ii. 8, the A. V. doubting is better. Rom. xiv. 1, is decisions of doubts (Rey., margin) or scruples. So Meyer, Godet, Lange, Beet, Shedd, Hodge, Tholuck, Alford, De Wette.   438 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. ([Ca. XXIV.   no more than a feeling for or after an object, without any actual coming in contact with it at all” (Trench, “Synonyms ”). Com- pare Acts xvii. 27. Used of groping in the dark, Job v. 14; of the blind, Isa. lix. 10; Deut. xxviii. 29; Judges, xvi. 26. See on Heb. xii. 18.   41. Meat (8pécrpov). Only here in New Testament. Lit., anything eatable. Wyc., anything that shall be eaten. Rev., better, anything to eat, as the word meat has largely lost, in popular usage, its old sense of food in general.  42. Broiled. Only here in New Testament.  Of an honey-comb. The best texts omit.  44. The words. The best texts insert my.   Must (dc2). See on ought not, ver. 26.   45, Understanding (vodv). Which had been closed. See on fools, ver. 25.   46. Thus it behoved. The best texts omit. Render, as Rev., thus it 1s written that the Christ should suffer.   Christ (rov Xpucrov). Note the article, the Christ, and see on Matt. i. 1.   47. Should be preached. See on preacher, 2 Pet. ii. 5.   In his name. On the foundation of (é77). See on Matt. CVO.   Remission. See on ch. iii. 3; and on forgiven, Jas. v. 15.   Beginning from Jerusalem. Some editors place a period   Cu. XXIV.] LUKE. 439   after nations, and join these words with the next sentence, omitting and: “ beginning from Jerusalem ye are witnesses.” *   49. Isend (éy@ é€arrocré\\iw). Rev., better, send forth, giving the force of é€. J emphatic.   Endued with power. The Rev. has properly substituted the simpler clothed, which, to the English reader, conveys the exact figure inthe word. This metaphorical sense of clothed is found in classical Greek. Aristophanes has clothed with audac- ity ; Homer, clothed with strength; Plutarch, clothed with nobility and wealth.   51. And was carried up into heaven.

Silas  first  appears  in Acts  XV.  22,  as  one  of  the  bearers  of  the  letter  to  the  Gen- tile Christians  at  Antioch.  He  accompanied  Paul  on  his second  missionary  tour,  and  was  left  behind  with  Timothy when  Paul  departed  from  Macedonia  after  his  first  visit. He  was  probably  a  Jewish  Christian  (see  Acts  xvi.  20),  and was,  like  Paul,  a  Roman  citizen  (Acts  xvi.  37,  88).  Hence his  Roman  name.  He  cannot  with  any  certainty  be  identi- fied with  the  Silvanus  of  1  Pet.  v.  12.  Timothy.  Appears  in  all  the  Pauline  Epistles  except  Gala- tians  and  Ephesians.  He  was  associated  with  Paul  longer than  any  one  of  whom  we  have  notice.  First  mentioned  Acts xvi.  1,  2 :  comp.  2  Tim.  iii.  10, 11.  He  accompanied  Paul  on his  second  missionary  tour  (Acts  xvi.  8),  and  was  one  of  the founders  of  the  churches  in  Thessalonica  and  Philippi.  He is  often  styled  by  Paul  \"  the  brother \"  (2  Cor.  i.  1 ;  Col.  i. 1 ;  1  Th.  iii.  2 ;  Philem.  1)  ;  with  Paul  himself  ^*  a  bondser-< vant  of  Jesus  Christ \"  (Philip,  i.  1)  ;  comp.  1  Tim.  ii.  18 ; 2  Tim.  i.  2.  Paul's  confidence  in  him  appears  in  Philip,  ii. 19-22,  and  is  implied  in  his  sending  him  from  Athens  to  the Thessalonian  church  to  establish  and  comfort  its  members (1  Th.  iii.  2).  Paul  sent  him  again  to  Macedonia  in  com- pany with  Erastus  (Acts  xix.  22),  and  also  to  Corinth (1  Cor.  iv.  17).  To  the  Corinthians  he  writes  of  Timothy as  \"  his  beloved  and  faithful  child  in  the  Lord \"  who  shall remind  them  of  his  ways  in  Christ  (1  Cor.  iv.  17),  and  as one  who  worketh  the  work  of  the  Lord  as  he  himself  (1  Cor. xvi.  10).  He  joined  Paul  at  Rome,  and  his  name  is  associ- Itted  with  Paul's  in  the  addresses  of  the  letters  to  the  Colos- sians  and  Philemon.  In  every  case  where  he  is  mentioned by  name  with  Silvanus,  the  name  of  Silvanus  precedes.  To  the  church  of  the  Thessalonians.  This  form  of address  appears  in  1st  and  2d  Corinthians,  Galatians,  2d Thessalonians.  The  other  letters  are  addressed  to  ^^the saints,\"  \"the  brethren,\"  \"the  saints  and  faithful  brethren.\" The  use  of  the  genitive  of  the  national  name  is  peculiar.   Cb.

The  yerbs  iKickfiauU^tiv  and  i^€/cK\\ffa-id^€iv  to  nim- mon  formally^  which  do  not  occur  in  N.

J,wa^<oyif  is  constantly  used  in  LXX  of  the children  of  Israel  as  a  body  (Ex.  xii.  6, 19,  47  ;  Ley.  iy.  13, etc.),  and  is  the  more  common  word  in  N.  T.  for  a  Jewish as  distinguished  from  a  Christian  assembly ;  sometimes  with the  addition  of  the  Jews  (Acts  xiii.  6  ;  xiy.  1 ;  xyii.  1).  It is  once  used  of  a  Christian  assembly  (Jas.  ii.  2).  ^IS^urw- aymyif  gathering  together^  occurs  2  Th.  ii.  1 ;  Heb.  x.  25. The  Ebionites  retained  awayeayif  in  preference  to  iKie\\ija-(a. The  LXX  translators  found  two  Hebrew  words  for  ^^  assem- bly\" or  \"congregation,\"  rrro  and  hrtp^^  and  rendered  the former  by  avpaycayif  in  the  g^at  majority  of  instances. ^EtcKXtja-la  does  not  appear  as  the  rendering  of  rrro.  They were  not  as  consistent  in  rendering  hr/S)^  since  they  used both  awaywyif  and  iKKXtfo-ia^  though  the  latter  was  the  more frequent :  see  Ley.  iy.  18  ;  Deut.  y.  22,  etc.  The  A.  V. renders  both  words  by  \"congregation\"  and  \"assembly\" indiscriminately.  'EKKXtja-Ca  is  only  once  used  in  N.  T.  of  a Jewish  congregation.  Acts  yii.  88;  yet  there  are  cases  where there  is  an  apparent  attempt  to  guard  its  distinctiyely Christian  sense  against  being  confounded  with  the  uncon- yerted  Jewish  communities.  Hence  the  addition  ip  Kpurr^ in  Christy  Gal.  i.  22 ;  iv  0€^  irarpl  xal  KvpCtp  ^Itfo-ov  Xpurr^ in  Ood  the  Father  and  the  Lord  Jemu  Chrietj  1  Th.  i.  1 ; comp.  2  Th.  i.  1.

So  Rom.  xvi.  5,  etc.  In  Qod  the  Father,  etc.  Const,  with  the  churchy  and comp.  2  Th.  i.  1.  The  phrase  \"the  church  in  God\"  is  pecul- iar to  the  Thessalonian  Epistles.  Elsewhere  \"©/  God\" (1  Cor.  X.  32;  xi.  16,  22;  xv.  9,  etc.);  \"of  the  saints\" (1  Cor.  xiv.  33).  Lightfoot  suggests  that  the  word  itctcXr}- cla  can  scarcely  have  been  stamped  with  so  definite  a Christian  meaning  in  the  minds  of  these  recent  and  early converts  as  to  render  the  addition  \"in  God  the  Father,\"  etc., superfluous.  Grace  to  you  and  peace  (x^pi9  viuv  icaX  elpiivrf).  In Romans,  1st  and  2d  Corinthians,  Galatians,  Ephesians,  Phi- lippians,  the  salutation  is,  Orace  to  you  and  peace  from  God our  Father  and  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ :  Colossians  omits  the last  five  words  of  this:  2  Thessalonians  omits  our  before Father.  On  the  union  of  the  Greek  and  Jewish  forms  of salutation,  see  on  1  Cor.  i.  3.  2.  We  give  thanks  (evxf^purrovfiev).  According  to  Paul's habit,  a  thanksgiving  follows  the  salutation,  commonly  with the  verb  evxapiorai^,  as  here;  but  in  2d  Corinthians  and  Ephes- ians, 6^X0717x09  6  0€(k  blessed  be  God.  The  thanksgiving  is omitted  only  in  Galatians.  The  verb  eifxaptaretv  occurs  only in  later  Greek,  and  there  but  rarely.  In  LXX  only  in Apocr.  See  Judith  viii.  25 ;  2  Mace.  i.  11 ;  x.  7 ;  3  Mace, vii.  16.  In  the  N.  T.  Epistles,  P^.  Originally  to  do  a  good turn;  hence,  to  return  a  favour.  The  meaning  to  give  thanks is  late.  The  kindred  noun  evxapifrrCa  giving  of  thanks^  is found  often  in  Paul.  As  a  designation  of  the  Lord's  Supper (JEkicharist)  it  is  not  found  in  the  N.  T.  Perhaps  the earliest  instance  of  its  use  in  that  sense  is  in  Ignatius.  See Philad.  iv. ;  Smyrn.  vi.,  viii.  ;  Eph.  xiii.  Comp.  Just. Mart.  Apol.  i.,  64,  65.  In  we  give  thanks^  it  is  not  easy  to  decide  whether  Paul uses  we  as  plural,  or  in  the  sense  of  J.     Bom.  iii.  9  seems  to   Ch.

In  1  Tb.  iii.  1,  2, ijvSoKija'afiev  we  thought  it  good^  and  hr^/iyp^afiev  we  sent^  can, apparently,  refer  only  to  Paul ;  and  similarly,  in  1  Tb.  iii.  6, irpoi  fllJLas:  unto  t«,  can  hardly  include  Silvanus  who  came  with Timothy  (comp.  iii.  5).  But  it  is  significant  that,  in  the  Epis- tles which  are  written  in  Paul's  name  alone  (Romans,  Gala* tians,  Ephesians),  only  /  is  used,  unless  we  except  Gral.  i.  8, which  is  doubtful.  Paul  and  Timothy  appear  jointly  as  cor- respondents in  Philippians,  but  the  first  person  predominates throughout  the  letter.  The  same  is  true  of  1st  Corinthians, where  Paul  and  Sosthenes  are  associated  in  the  address,  but the  singular  pronoun  is  used  almost  throughout.  (See  iv. 10-13 ;  ix.  4,  5,  25,  26).  In  Colossians  Paul  and  Timothy appear  in  the  address.  The  plural  prevails  to  i.  23,  and alternates  with  the  singular  throughout  the  remainder.  The alternations  in  2d  Corinthians  are  very  bewildering.  On  the  whole,  I  think  that  occasional  instances  of  the epistolary  plural  must  be  granted.  It  is  not,  however,  PauPs habitual  usage.  We  is  often  employed  as  in  ordinary  corre- spondence or  argument,  where  the  writer  or  speaker  associates himself  with  his  readers  or  hearers.  Abundant  illustrations of  this  may  be  seen  in  Rom.  vi.  and  viii. ;  but  in  other  cases, when  Paul  speaks  in  the  plural,  he  usually  associates  his fellow-ministers,  mentally,  with  himself.*  Making  mention  (^/Aveiav  iroiovfievoi).

In  classical Greek  the  word  does  not  occur  in  the  sense  of  prayer.  It  is found  in  later  Greek,  meaning  a  place  for  prayer^  in  which sense  it  appears  in  Acts  xvi.  18,  16.  It  signified  either  a synagogue^  or  an  open  praying^laee  outside  of  a  city.*  3.  Without  ceasing  {aSiaXehnw).

V.  and  Rev.  The  salutations of  Paul  reproduce  ordinary  conventional  forms  of  greeting. Thus  the  familiar  Greek  greeting  x^^^^  ^^  Jot/ftUj  hail^ welcome^  appears  in  x^P^  grace.  This  was  perceived  by Theodore  of  Mopsuestia  (860-428  a.d.),  who,  in  his  com- mentary on  Ephesians,  says  that  in  the  preface  to  that  letter Paul  does  very  much  as  we  do  when  we  say  ^*  So  and  so  to  So and  so,  greeting  \"  (o  Seiva  r^  Scm  ;^a4'€iy).  Deissmann  gives some  interesting  paraUels  from  ancient  papyri.

In  these  *  There  has  been  some  dispute  as  to  whether  it  was  applied  to  a  syna- gogue, but  the  usage  of  Josephus  and  Philo  seems  decisive  in  favour  of  that meaning.  See  Jos.  VUa,  64 ;  Juvenal,  8ai.  OX  296 ;  Schttrer,  The  Jewish People  in  theTime  of  Jesus  Christ,  Div.  IL,  Vol.  BE.,  p.  73 ;  Wendt,  Apostel- gesMchUt  on  Acts  xvi.  13.

It  is  further  to  be  noticed  that  many  passages  of Paul's  Epistles  give  evidence  of  having  been  shaped  by expressions  in  letters  received  by  him  from  the  parties  he is  addressing.  In  his  answer  he  gives  them  back  their  own words,  as  is  common  in  correspondence.  Thus,  making  men- tion of  f/ou  and  remembering  your  work^  etc.,  together  with  the statement  that  Timothy  reports  that  you  have  a  good  remem- brance of  us  (ch.  iii.  6),  all  together  suggest  that  Paul  had before  him,  when  writing  to  the  Thessalonians,  a  letter  which Timothy  had  brought  from  them.  Other  instances  will  be noted  as  they  occur.*  Work  —  labour  —  patience  (^Ipyov — tcSirov  —  ifTro/ioi^?). \"Epyov  work^  may  mean  either  the  act^  the  simple  trans- action, or  the  process  of  dealing  with  anything,  or  the  restdt of  the  dealing,  —  as  a  book  or  a  picture  is  called  a  work.

From  the  Aramaic  Sdtund,  adversary. In  the  canonical  LXX  the  name  appears  only  three  times, 1  K.  xi.  14,  23,  25,  and  in  each  case  is  applied  to  a  man. In  LXX  Sid/SoXo^  is  used,  almost  without  exception,  as the   translation  of  the   Heb.  Satan.      Of   22  instances  of  the  Epistle  is  a  forgery,  or  at  least  that  w.  14-16  are  interpolated.  Sucb criticism  is  hardly  worthy  of  notice.  Any  allusion  here  to  Paul's  part  in Jewish  persecutions  would  have  been  in  singularly  bad  taste.  As  for  Paul's patriotism,  genuine  and  deep  though  it  was,  it  was  secondary  to  his  consuming zeal  for  Christ  and  his  gospel.  What  he  here  says  about  the  Jews  he  had long  known,  and  his  recent  experience  in  Macedonia  might  have  moved  even a  patriot  to  fierce  indignation  against  his  own  people.

From  the more  genersLl  conception  of  an  adversary,  there  is,  in  the O.  Tm  a  gradual  development  toward  that  of  an  evil  per- sonality. For  instance,  in  2  Sam.  xxiv.  1,  the  numbering of  the  people  is  ascribed  to  the  anger  of  the  Lord.  The later  historian,  in  1  Chron.  xxi.  1,  ascribes  the  act  to  Satan. See  also  Job,  Wisd.  ii.  24  ;  Zech.  iii.  1.  The  specialising  oi the  conception  was  due,  in  part,  to  the  contact  of  the  Jews with  the  religions  of  Babylon  and  Persia.  In  N.  T.  Satan appears  as  the  personal  spirit  of  evil  —  the  same  who  is called  the  devils  the  wicked  one^  the  prince  of  the  power  of  the air,  the  prince  of  this  worlds  the  serpent^  the  god  of  thi$  world, the  tempter.  He  tempts  to  evil,  opposes  God's  work,  inspires evil  dispositions,  torments  God's  people.  The  word  Satan occurs  only  once  in  the  Fourth  Gospel,  not  in  the  Epistles, but  often  in  the  Apocalypse.  Mark  never  uses  &a^oXo9, Matthew  never  Satan.  Paul  seldom  Bui/SoXo^,  often  Satan. Satan  alone  in  Pastorals.  Luke  uses  both.  It  is  clear that  Paul  here  as  elsewhere  employs  the  word  in  a  personal sense ;  but  any  attempt  to  base  the  doctrine  of  a  personal devil  on  this  and  similar  passages  is  unsafe.*  Hindered  (iv^KO'^').

This  view  is  known  as  the  Helvid- ian  theory^  from  Helvidius,  a  layman  of  Rome,  who  wrote, about  880,  a  book  against  mariolatry  and  ascetic  celibacy. The  explanations  which  differ  from  that  of  Helvidius  have grown,  largely,  out  of  the  desire  to  maintain  the  perpetual virginity  of  Mary.  Jerome  has  given  his  name  to  a  theory known  as  the  Hieronymian,  put  forth  in  reply  to  Helvidius, about  888,  according  to  which  the  brethren  of  the  Lord  were the  sons  of  his  mother's  sister,  Mary  the  wife  of  Alphaeus  or Clopas,  and  therefore  Jesus'  cousins.

Paul  recognises  the  honorable  position  of the  three  and  their  rightful  claim  to  respect.  The  repetition of  the  phrase  (vv.  6,  9)  may  point  to  a  favorite  expression of  his  opponents  in  commen^ng  these  leaders  to  Paul  as models  for  his  preaching  ;  hardly  (as  Lightfoot)  to  the  con- trast between  the  estimation  in  which  they  were  held  and the  actual  services  which  they  rendered  to  him.

On  this  explanation  /it;  7ri»9  will  be  rendered  lest  in  some way  or  other.  But  such  a  misgiving  is  contrary  to  Paul's habitual  attitude  of  settled  conviction  respecting  that  gospel which  he  had  received  by  revelation,  and  in  the  preaching of  which  he  had  been  confirmed  by  experience.  In  consult- ing the  Christians  at  Jerusalem  Paul  had  principally  in view  the  formal  indorsement  of  his  work  by  the  church  and its  leaders.  Their  formal  declaration  that  he  had  not  been running  in  vain  would  materially  aid  him  in  his  mission. My;  7ra>9  is  therefore  to  be  taken  as  marking  an  indirect question,  whether  —  not  possibly  ;  and  the  sense  of  the  whole passage  is  as  follows  :  ^^  I  laid  before  them  that  gospel  which I  preach  to  the  Gentiles,  that  they  might  examine  and  settle for  themselves  the  question  whether  I  am  not  possibly  run- ning or  had  run  in  vain.\"  The  investigation  was  to  be  for their  satisfaction,  not  for  Paul's.*  Run  (rpix^iv)  is  a  favorite metaphor  with  Paul.

The  difficulty  of  reconciling  these  two  positions,  which  is  clearly recognised  by  Ellicott^  is  evaded  by  referring  r^w  and  HSpaitov  to  the  opin- ions of  others.

Possibly  Paul  here  cites  the  very words  by  which  Peter  sought  to  justify  his  separation  from the  Gentile  Christians,  and  takes  up  these  words  in  order  to draw  from  them  an  opposite  conclusion.  This  is  quite according  to  Paul's  habit.  16.  Justified  (hKcuoinaC).  See  on  Rom.  iii.  20, 26.  The meaning  to  declare  or  pronounce  righteous  cannot  be  consist- ently carried  through  Paul's  writings  in  the  interest  of  a theological  fiction  of  imputed  righteousness.  See,  for  exam- ple, Rom.  iv.  25  ;  1  Cor.  vi.  11 ;  and  all  passages  where  the word  is  used  to  describe  justification  by  works  of  the  law,  as here,  ch.  iii.  11 ;  v.  4.  If  one  is  justified  by  the  works  f** the  law,  his  righteousness  is  a  recU  righteousness,  foundea upon  his  conformity  to  the  law.

This  would  mean,  as  the Romish  interpreters,  not  through  works  of  the  law  except  they be  done  through  faith  in  Christy  and  would  ascribe  justification to  works  which  grow  out  of  faith.  Paul  means  that  justifi- cation is  by  faith  alone.  The  use  of  Hlp  /a^  is  to  be  thus explained  :  A  man  is  not  justified  by  the  works  of  the  law  : (he  is  not  justified)  except  by  faith  in  Jesus  Christ.    *B^  ftii   CSb.  n.]  THB  EPISTLE  TO  THE  GALATIAK8.  105  retains  its  exceptive  force,  but  the  exception  refers  only  to the  verb.

Paul  uses  different prepositions  in  describing  the  relations  of  faith  and  works  to righteousness ;  probably  not  always  with  a  distinct  intention of  giving  different  shades  of  thought.

Paul assumes  that  this  was  actually  the  case :  that,  seeking  to  be justified  in  Christ,  they  were  found  to  be  sinners.  To  seek to  be  justified  by  Christ  is  an  admission  that  there  is  no  jus- tification by  works ;  that  the  seeker  is  unjustified,  and  there- fore a  sinner.  The  effort  to  attain  justification  by  faith  in Christ  develops  the  consciousness  of  sin.  It  compels  the seeker,  whether  Jew  or  Gentile,  to  put  himself  upon  the conmion  plane  of  sinners.  The  Jew  who  calls  the  Gentile  a sinner,  in  seeking  to  be  justified  by  faith,  finds  himself  a  sin- ner also.  The  law  has  failed  him  as  a  justifying  agency. But  Paul  is  careful  to  repudiate  the  false  inference  from  this fact,  stated  in  what  immediately  follows,  namely,  that  Christ is  a  minister  of  sin.   lOii  WORD  STUDIES  IN  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT.

Not  a reply  merely  to  the  question  \"  is  Christ  a  minister  of  sin  ?  \" but  to  the  whole  supposition  from  ^^if  while  we  seek.\"  The question  is  not  whether  Christ  is  in  general  a  minister  of  sin, but  whether  he  is  such  in  the  case  supposed.  Paul  does  not assume  that  this  false  inference  has  been  drawn  by  Peter  or the  other  Jewish  Christians.  20.  I  build  again  the  things  which  I  destroyed  (h  mari- \\vaa  ravra  irdXiv  oUoBofiA).  Peter,  by  his  Christian  profes- sion, had  asserted  that  justification  was  by  faith  alone  ;  and by  his  eating  with  Gentiles  had  declared  that  the  Mosaic  law was  no  longer  binding  upon  him.  He  had  thus,  figuratively, destroyed  or  pvlled  down  the  Jewish  law  as  a  standard  of Christian  faith  and  conduct.  By  his  subsequent  refusal  to eat  with  Gentiles  he  had  retracted  this  declaration,  had asserted  that  the  Jewish  law  was  still  binding  upon  Christians, and  had  thus  built  again  what  he  had  pulled  down.  Build- ing and  pulling  do^vn  are  favorite  figures  with  Paul.  See Rom.  xiv.  20;  xv.  20;  1  Cor.  viii.  1,  10;  x.  28;  xiv.  4,  17; Eph.  ii.  20  f .

Justifying  the  previous  thought  that  the reerection  of  the  law  as  a  standard  of  Christian  life  and  a means  of  justification  is  a  condemnation  of  the  faith  which relies  on  Christ  alone  for  righteousness.  1^  through  the  law^  am  dead  to  the  law  (iy&  Bih  v6fjLov v6iixp  airSavov).

I  am  crucified  with  Christ  (Xpurr^  crweirravpa^fAcu). This  compound  verb  is  used  by  Paul  only  here  and  Rom.  vi. 6.  In  the  gospels.  Matt,  xxvii.  44 ;  Mk.  xv.  82 ;  J.  xix.  82. The  statement  explains  how  a  believer  dies  to  the  law  by means  of  the  law  itself.  In  the  crucifixion  of  Christ  as  one accursed,  the  demand  of  the  law  was  met  (see  Gal.  iii.  18). Ethically,  a  believer  is  crucified  with  Christ  (Rom.  vi.  8-11 ; Philip,  iii.  10 ;  1  Cor.  xv.  81 ;  2  Cor.  iv.  10),  and  thus  the demand  of  the  law  is  fulfilled  in  him  likewise.  Paul  means that,  ^*'  owing  to  his  connection  with  the  crucified,  he  was, like  him,  legally  impure,  and  was  thus  an  outcast  from  the Jewish  church.\"  *  He  became  dead  to  the  law  by  the  law's own  act.

Paul  says  :  **'  I do  not  invalidate  the  grace  of  God  in  the  offering  of  Christ, as  one  does  who  seeks  to  reestablish  the  law  as  a  means  of justification  ;  for  if  righteousness  comes  through  the  law, there  was  no  occasion  for  Christ  to  die.\"  Additional  Note  on  Verses  14-21.  The  coarse  of  thought  in  Paul's  address  to  Peter  is  difficult  to  follow. It  will  help  to  simplify  it  if  the  reader  will  keep  it  before  him  that  the whole  passage  is  to  be  interpreted  in  the  light  of  Peter's  false  attitude  — as  a  remonstrance  against  a  particular  state  of  things.  The  line  of  remonstrance  is  as  follows.  If  you,  Peter,  being  a  Jew, do  not  live  as  a  Jew,  but  as  a  Grentile,  as  you  did  when  you  ate  with Grentiles,  why  do  you,  by  your  example  in  withdrawing  from  Grentile tables,  constrain  Gentile  Christians  to  live  as  Jews,  obsenring  the  separa- tive ordinances  of  the  Jewish  law?    This  course  is  plainly  inconsistent.  Even  you  and  I,  bom  Jews,  and  not  Gentiles — sinners  —  denied  the obligation  of  these  ordinances  by  the  act  of  believing  on  Jesus  Christ. In  professing  this  faith  we  committed  ourselves  to  the  principle  that  no one  can  be  justified  by  the  works  of  the  law.   110  WORD  STUDIES  IN  THE  NEW  TB9TAMBNT.      [Gb.  UL  Bat  it  may  be  said  that  we  were  in  no  better  case  by  thus  abandoning the  law  and  legal  righteousness,  since,  in  the  very  effort  to  be  justified through  Christ,  we  were  shown  to  be  sinners,  and  therefore  in  the  same category  with  the  Gentiles.  Does  it  not  then  follow  that  Christ  is  proved to  be  a  minister  of  sin  in  requiring  us  to  abandon  the  law  as  a  means  of justification  ?  No.  God  forbid.  It  is  true  that,  in  seeking  to  be  justified  in  Christ, we  stood  revealed  as  sinners,  for  it  was  Christ  who  showed  us  that  we could  not  be  justified  by  the  works  of  the  law ;  that  all  oar  legal  atrict- ness  only  left  us  sinners.  But  the  inference  is  false  that  Christ  is  thexebj shown  to  be  a  minister  of  sin.  For  to  say  that  Christ  is  a  minister  of  sin,  is  to  say  that  I,  at  his  bid- ding,  became  a  transgressor  by  abandoning  the  law,  and  tiiat  the  law  is the  only  true  standard  and  medium  of  righteousness.  If  I  reassert  the obligation  of  the  law  after  denying  that  obligation,  I  thereby  assert  that I  transgressed  in  abandoning  it,  and  that  Christ,  who  prompted  and demanded  this  transgression,  is  a  minister  of  sin.  But  this  I  deny.  The  law  is  not  the  true  standard  and  medium  of righteousness.  I  did  not  transgress  in  abandoning  it  Christ  is  not  m minister  of  sin.  For  it  was  the  law  itself  which  compelled  me  to  abandon the  law.  The  law  crucified  Christ  and  thereby  declared  him  aoeursed. In  virtue  of  my  moral  fellowship  with  Christ,  I  was  (ethically)  crucified with  him.  The  law  declared  me  also  accursed,  and  would  have  no  more of  me.  The  act  of  the  law  forced  me  to  break  with  the  law.  Through the  law  I  died  to  the  law.  Thus  I  came  under  a  new  principle  of  life.  I no  longer  live,  but  Christ  lives  in  me.  If  I  should  declare  that  righteous- ness is  through  the  law,  by  reasserting  the  obligation  of  the  law  as  yoo, Peter,  have  done,  I  should  annul  the  grace  of  God  as  exhibited  in  the death  of  Christ;  for  in  that  case,  durist's  death  would  be  si^rfluoos and  useless.    But  I  do  not  annul  the  grace  of  God.   CHAPTER  m.  1.  Foolish  (aviryroC).  See  on  L.  xxiv.  26.  In  N.  T.  and LXX  always  in  an  active  sense.  See  L.  xxiv.  25 ;  Rom.

The  active  voice,  always  in  N.  T.  with  the  object expressed,  means  to  bring  to  completion.  See  Rom.  xv.  28 ; 2  Cor.  vii.  1 ;  Philip,  i.  6 ;  Heb.  viii.  5.

The  pres- ent tense  indicates  that  they  have  already  begun  upon  this attempt.  The  flesh.  The  worldly  principle  or  element  of  life,  rep- resented by  the  legal  righteousness  of  the  Jew.  4.  Have  ye  suffered  (hrdOere).  Or,  did  ye  suffer.  The exact  sense  is  doubtful.  By  some  it  is  held  that  the  ref- erence is  to  sufferings  endured  by  the  Galatian  Christians either  through  heathen  persecutions  or  Judaising  emissaries. There  is,  however,  no  record  in  this  Epistle  or  elsewhere  of the  Galatians  having  suffered  special  persecutions  on  account of  their  Christian  profession.  Others  take  the  verb  in  a  neut- ral sense,  have  ye  experienced^  or  with  a  definite  reference  to the  experience  of  benefits.  In  this  neutral  sense  it  is  used in  Class,  from  Homer  down,  and  is  accordingly  joined  with both  KOKW  evilly^  and  cS  well.    Paul  habitually  uses  it  in  the  TOL.

In  Class., where  it  is  used  of  the  experience  of  benefits,  it  is  always accompanied  by  some  qualifying  word.  When  it  stands  alone it  signifies  to  suffer  evil.  The  evidence  on  the  whole  makes yery  strongly  for  the  meaning  euffer;  in  which  case  the  refer- ence is,  probably,  to  the  annoyances  suffered  from  Judaising Christians.  It  must  be  said,  on  the  other  hand,  that  a  refer- ence to  such  annoyances  seems  far-fetched.  If  we  could translate  did  ye  experience  (so  WeizsScker,  Lipsius,  Sieffert), the  reference  would  be  to  the  impartation  of  the  gifts  of  the Spirit.  In  vain  (ei#c^).

The  thought  of  ver.  2  is  further  emphasised.  The  gift  of the  Spirit,  and  the  bestowment  of  miraculous  powers,  is  a purely  divine  operation  in  believers,  which  is  not  merited by  legal  works,  but  can  be  received  and  experienced  only through  the  message  of  faith.

The  idea  of  abun- dant supply  (Lightf oot),  if  conveyed  at  all,  resides,  not  in  the preposition  iirl^  which  indicates  direction,  but  in  the  simple verb,  which  is  used  of  abundant,  liberal  supply.

Even  as  («ca0a)9).  The  answer  to  the  question  of  ver. 6  is  so  obvious  that  it  is  not  given.  Paul  proceeds  at  once to  the  illustration  —  the  argument  for  the  righteousness  of faith  furnished  in  the  justification  of  Abraham.  The  spirit- ual gifts  come  through  the  message  of  faith,  even  as  Abraham believed,  etc.  Believed  Qod  (hrlarevaev  ry  ^e^).  See  on  Rom.  iv.  5.

The  deliverance  from  the  curse  results  not only  in  extending  to  the  Gentiles  the  blessing  promised  to Abraham,  but  in  the  impartation  of  the  Spirit  to  both  Jews and  Gentiles  through  faith.  The  evXoyla  blessing  is  not God's  gift  of  justification  as  the  opposite  of  the  curse ;  for in  vv.  10,  11,  justification  is  not  represented  as  the  opposite of  the  curse,  but  as  that  by  which  the  curse  is  removed  and the  blessing  realised.  The  content  of  the  curse  is  deatJ^ ver.  13.  The  opposite  of  the  curse  is  life.  The  subject  of the  promise  is  the  life  which  comes  through  the  Spirit.

The  doctrine  of  the Judaisers,  while  virtaally  annulling  the  promise,  was  appar- ently only  the  imposing  of  new  conditions.  In  either  caae it  was  a  violation-  of  the  covenant.  16.  The  course  of  thought  is  as  follows.  The  main  point is  that  the  promises  to  Abraham  continue  to  hold  for  Christ- ian believers  (ver.  17).  It  might  be  objected  that  the  law made  these  promises  void.  After  stating  that  a  human covenant  is  not  invalidated  or  added  to  by  any  one,  he  would argue  from  this  analogy  that  a  covenant  of  Ood  is  not  an- nulled by  the  law  which  came  afterwards.  But  before  reach- ing this  point,  he  must  call  attention  to  the  fact  that  the promises  were  given,  not  to  Abraham  only,  but  to  his  de- scendants. Hence  it  follows  that  the  covenant  was  not  a mere  temporary  contract,  made  to  last  only  up  to  the  time of  the  law.  Even  a  man's  covenant  remains  uncancelled and  vidthout  additions.  Similarly,  God's  covenant-promises to  Abraham  remain  valid ;  and  this  is  made  certain  by  the fact  that  the  promises  were  given  not  only  to  Abraham  but to  his  seed ;  and  since  the  singular,  need^  is  used,  and  not Beeds^  it  is  evident  that  Christ  is  meant.

Emphatic,  as  making for  bis  conclusion  in  ver.  17.  There  can  be  no  disannulling by  the  law  of  a  promise  made  not  only  to  Abraham,  but  to his  seed.  Not  —  to  seeds  (ov — roU  awipiMunv),  He  means  that there  is  significance  in  the  singular  form  of  expression,  as pointing  to  the  fact  that  (me  descendant  (seed)  is  intended  — Christ.  With  regard  to  this  line  of  argument  it  is  to  be  said, 1.  The  original  promise  referred  to  the  posterity  of  Abraham generally^  and  therefore  applies  to  Christ  individually  only  as representing  these :  as  gathering  up  into  one  all  who  should be  incorporated  with  him.  2.  The  original  word  for  seed  in the  O.  T.,  wherever  it  means  progeny^  is  used  in  the  singu- lar, whether  the  progeny  consists  of  one  or  many.  In  the plural  it  means  grains  of  seed^  as  1  Sam.  viii.  15.  It  is  evi- dent that  Paul's  argument  at  this  point  betrays  traces  of  his rabbinical  education  (see  Schoettgen,  Horae  Hehraicae^  Vol. I.,  p.  736),  and  can  have  no  logical  force  for  nineteenth-cen- tury readers.

All  this  may  be  so,  — nevertheless,  we  have  here  an  interpretation  which  the apostle,  writing  under  the  illumination  of  the  Holy  Ghost,  has  deliberately propounded,  and  which  therefore,  whatever  difficulties  may  at  first  appear in  it,  is  profoundly  and  indisputably  true.**   122  WORD  STUDIES  IK  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT.

With  relation to  God's  promise,  the  Judaisers  insisted  on  addition;  since, while  they  preached  faith  in  the  promise  and  in  its  fulfilment in  Christ,  they  made  the  inheritance  of  the  promise  dependent upon  the  fulfilling  of  the  law.  Paul,  on  the  other  hand,  holds that  the  Judaistic  addition  involves  invalidation.  Salvation must  rest  either  upon  the  promise  or  upon  the  law.  The Judaiser  said,  upon  the  promise  and  the  law.  For  God  gave the  inheritance  to  Abraham  by  promise.  It  has  been  shown that  the  law  did  not  abrogate  the  promise.

See  Heb.  ii.  2;  Acts  vii.  88,  68.  In  the later  rabbinical  schools  great  importance  was  attached  to this  tradition,  and  it  was  not  without  influence  in  shaping the  doctrine  of  angelic  mediation  which  formed  one  of  the elements  of  the  Colossian  heresy.  Josephus  (^Ant.  zv.  6,  8) relates  that  Herod  excited  the  Jews  to  battle  by  a  speech,  in which  he  said  that  they  had  learned  the  holiest  of  laws  from God  through  angels.

The  mediator  here  is  Moses,  who  is  often  so designated  by  rabbinical  writers.  The  object  is  not  (as Meyer)  to  enable  the  reader  to  realise  the  glory  of  the  law in  the  dignity  and  formal  solemnity  of  its  ordination,  but  to indicate  the  inferior,  subordinate  position  held  by  the  law  in comparison  with  the  promisey  not  the  gospel.  A  glorification of  the  law  cannot  be  intended,  since  if  that  were  contemplated in  the  mention  of  angels  and  the  mediator,  the  statement  woold tend  to  the  disparagement  of  the  promise  which  was  given without  a  mediator.  Paul,  in  the  section  iii.  6-iv.  7,  aims  to show  that  the  law  does  not,  as  the  Judaisers  assume,  stand  in a  relation  to  the  divine  plan  of  salvation  as  direct  and  positive as  does  the  promise,  and  that  it  has  not,  like  the  promise  and its  fulfilment,  an  eternal  significance.  On  the  contrary,  it  has only  a  transitory  value.     This  estimate  of  the  law  does  not   Cb.

Now  a  mediator  is  not  a  mediator  of  one  (o  Sk  ii&rtnfi ivoi  ovK  itmv).  Observe,  1.  A^  is  explanatory^  not  antithetic. The  verse  illustrates  the  conception  of  mediator.  2.  The  arti- cle, the  mediator,  has  a  generic  force  :  the  mediator  according to  the  general  and  proper  conception  of  his  function.  Comp. the  apostle  (2  Cor.  xii.  12);  the  shepherd,  the  good  (J.  x.  11). 3.  'E^k  of  onej  is  to  be  explained  by  the  following  el?,  so  that it  is  masculine  and  personal.  We  are  not  to  supply  party  or law.  The  meaning  is  :  the  conception  of  mediator  does  not belong  to  an  individual  considered  singly.  One  is  not  a mediator  of  hb  single  self,  but  he  is  a  mediator  between two  contracting  parties;  in  this  case  between  God  and  the people  of  Israel,  as  Lfev.  xxvi.  46 ;  thus  differing  from  Christ, who  is  called  the  mediator  of  a  new  covenant  (Heb.  viii.  6 ; ix.  15;  xii.  24).  The  new  covenant,  the  gospel,  was  not  a contract.  Accordingly  ver.  20  serves  to  define  the  true  con- ception of  a  mediator,  and  through  this  definition  to  make clearer  the  difference  between  the  law,  which  required  a mediator,  and  the  promise,  which  is  the  simple  expression of  God's  will.  The  very  idea  of  mediation  supposes  two parties.  The  law  is  of  the  nature  of  a  contract  between  God and  the  Jewish  people.  The  validity  of  the  contract  depends on  its  fulfilment  by  both  parties.  Hence  it  is  contingent, not  absolute.  But  Qod  is  one  (6  Si  Oei^  ek  iarCv).  God  does  not  need  a mediator  to  make  his  promise  valid.  His  promise  is  not  of the  nature  of  a  contract  between  two  parties.  His  promise depends  on  his  own  individual  decree.  He  dealt  with  Abra- ham singly  and  directly,  without  a  mediator.  The  dignity  of the  law  is  thus  inferior  to  that  of  the  promise.  21.  Against  the  promises  (jcark  r&p  ivayyeKi&v).

This  could only  be  true  in  case  the  law  gave  life^  for  life  piust  come either  through  the  promises  or  through  the  law.  If  the  law is  against  the  promises,  and  makes  them  invalid,  it  follows that  life  must  come  through  the  law,  and  therefore  righteous- ness, without  which  there  is  no  life,  would  veriljf  (6vtoo^^^  just as  the  Judaisers  claim,  be  through  the  law.

But  the  office  of  the  law  as  a  jailer  was  designed  to  be only  temporary,  until  the  time  when  faith  should  come.

In  civil  law a  tutor  is  a  person  legally  appointed  for  the  care  of  the  person and  property  of  a  minor.

The  later  use  of  the  word, however,  in  the  sense  of  instructor^  has  so  completely  sup- planted the  earlier,  that  the  propriety  of  the  Revisers'  ren- dering is  questionable.  The  law  is  here  represented,  not  as one  who  conducts  to  the  school  of  Christ ;  for  Christ  is  not represented  here  as  a  teacher,  but  as  an  atoner ;  but  rather  as an  overseer  or  guardian^  to  keep  watch  of  those  committed  to its  care,  to  accompany  them  with  its  commands  and  prohibi- tions, and  to  keep  them  in  a  condition  of  dependence  and restraint,  thus  continually  bringing  home  to  them  the  con- sciousness of  being  shut  up  in  sins,  and  revealing  sin  aa positive  transgression.*  26.

The emphasis  is  on  $ons  of  Ood  rather  than  on  all;  for  his  object is  to  show  that,  after  the  coming  of  faith,  they  are  no  more under  the  care  of  a  guardian.  *Tiol  signifies  sons  of  full  age (comp.  ch.  iv.  1)  who  have  outgrown  the  surveillance  of  the guardian ;  so  that  sans  is  emphasised  as  against  children. Paul  describes  Christians  both  as  r^eva  dtov  children  of  God (Rom.  viii.  16,  21 ;  ix.  8 ;  Philip,  ii.  15),  and  viol  Oeov  sons of  God  (Rom.  viii.  14,  19  ;  ix.  26).  Both  tAcvov  and  vi69 signify  a  relation  based  on  parentage.  The  common  distinc- tion between  rixvov  as  emphasising  natural  relationship,  and vU^  as  marking  legal  or  ethical  status,  should  not  be  pressed. In  LXX  both  words  are  applied  ethically  to  Israel  as  God's beloved  people.  See  Isa.  xxx.  1 ;  Wisd.  xvi.  21 ;  Joel  ii. 28 ;  Zech.  ix.  18 ;  and  Isa.  xliii.  6 ;  Deut.  xiv.  1 ;  Wisd.  ix. 7 ;  xii.  19.  John  never  uses  vUk  to  describe  the  relation  of Christians  to  God;  but  he  attaches  both  the  ethical  relation  and that  of  conferred  privilege,  as  well  as  that  of  birth,  to  ritcvov. See  J.  i.  12 ;  1  J.  iii.  1, 10 ;  J.  i.  18 ;  iii.  8,  7 ;  1  J.  iii.  9 ; iv.  7 ;  V.  1,  4, 18.  Paul  often  regards  the  Christian  relation from  a  leg^  point  of  view  as  vlodeaia  adoption^  a  word  used only  by  him.  See  Rom.  viii.  16,  28 ;  Gal.  iv.  6 ;  Eph.  i.  6 ; but  in  Rom.  viii.  14, 17,  we  have  both  viol  and  rAcvoy  and both  in  the  ethical  sense.  In  Rom.  viii.  21  rAcpa  has  the legal  sense.  In  Rom.  ix.  8;  Eph.  v.  1,  the  ethical  sense. 8.  In  Christ  Jesus.  Const,  with  faith.

To  put  on  Christ implies  making  his  character,  feelings  and  works  our  own. Thus  Chrysostom  :  ^^  If  Christ  is  Son  of  God,  and  thou  hast put  him  on,  having  the  Son  in  thyself  and  being  made  like unto  him,  thou  hast  been  brought  into  one  family  and  one nature.''

Paul  shows  that  Abraham  was  justi- fied by  faith,  and  was  thus  constituted  the  spiritual  father  of all  believers  in  Christ,  whether  circumcised  or  uncircumcised. The  purpose  of  God  in  making  the  inheritance  of  the  promise dependent  on  faith  was  that  the  promise  might  be  sure  to  aU the  seed.  Abraham,  he  says,  is  ^^the  father  of  tis  aW^  (Rom. iv.  16).  This  spiritual  paternity  does  away  with  the  current Jewish  notion  of  physical  paternity.  Physical  relationship with  Abraham  is  of  no  significance  in  the  economy  of  salva- tion. The  apostle  *^  discovers  the  basis  of  Christian  univers- alism  in  the  very  life  of  him  in  whose  person  theocratic particularism  was  founded.  He  has  demonstrated  the  exist- ence of  a  time  when  he  represented  Gentilism,  or,  to  speak more  properly,  mankind  in  general ;  and  it  was  during  this period,  when  he  was  not  yet  a  Jew,  but  simply  a  man,  that he  received  salvation\"  (Godet).

There  is  nothing un-Pauline  in  the  association  of  conscience  and  faith,  al- though, as  a  fact,  Paul  does  not  formally  associate  them.

The  sound teaching  (comp.  SiBaxfi  teaching^  2  Tim.  iv.  2;  Tit.  i.  9) which  is  thus  commended  is  Paul's,  who  teaches  in  Chri8t*8 name  and  by  his  authority  (2  Tim.  i.  IS ;  ii.  2,  8).  In  all the  three  letters  it  is  called  a\\ri0€Ui  or  ^  aXi^^cia  the  truths  the knowledge  (hrlrpwHrisi')  of  which  is  bound  up  with  salvation. See  1  Tim.  ii.  4;  2  Tim.  ii.  26;  iii.  7;  Tit.  i.  1.  As  truth it  is  eound  or  healthful.  It  is  the  object  ol  faith.  To  be sound  in  the  faith  is,  practically,  to  follow  (irapoKoXovOeiv) sound  teaching  or  the  truth.  The  subjective  characteristic of  Christians  is  euo-^/Seia  or  Oeoa^fieia  godlineit  or  piety  (1  Tim. ii.  2,  10;  iii.  16;  iv.  7,  8;  vi.  6,  11);  and  the  teaching  and knowledge  of  the  truth  are  represented  as  Kar  evcifieuiv  ao- cording  to  godlinese  (1  Tim.  vi.  3 ;  Tit.  i.  1).

The  contents  of  this sound  teaching  which  is  according  to  godliness  are  not  theo- retical or  dogmatic  truth,  but  Christian  ethics,  with  faith  and love.  See  1  Tim.  i.  14 ;  ii.  15 ;  iv.  12 ;  vi.  11 ;  2  Tim.  i.  13 ; iii.  10;  Tit.  ii.  2.  'AXi^^cia  truth  is  used  of  moral  things, rather  than  in  the  high  religious  sense  of  Paul.  Comp.,  for instance,  Rom.  iii.  7;  ix.  1 ;  1  Cor.  v.  8 ;  2  Cor.  iv.  2 ;  xi.  10 ; Gal.  ii.  6 ;  Eph.  iv.  21,  24 ;  and  2  Tim.  ii.  25,  26 ;  iii.  7  (comp. w.  1-9) ;  iv.  3,  4 ;  Tit.  i.  12  (comp.  w.  11, 15) ;  Tit.  ii.  4 (comp.  w.  1,  3)  ;  Tit.  iii.  1.  Whoever  grasps  the  truth  has faith  (2  Tim.  i.  13;  ii.  18 ;  iii.  8;  Tit.  i.  8  f.).  That  the ethical  character  of  faith  is  emphasised,  appears  from  the numerous  expressions  regarding  the  false  teachers,  as  1  Tim. i.  19 ;  iv.  1 ;  v.  8,  12 ;  vi.  10,  21.  There  is  a  tendency  to objectify  faith,  regarding  it  as  something  believed  rather  than as  the  act  of  believing.  See  1  Tim.  i.  19 ;  iv.  1 ;  vi.  10,  21 ; Tit.  i.  4.  In  comparing  the  ideal  of  righteousness  (ver.  9) with  that  of  Paul,  note  that  it  is  not  denied  that  Christ  is  the source  of  true  righteousness ;  but  according  to  Paul,  the  man who  is  not  under  the  law  is  the  man  who  lives  by  faith  in Christ.  Paul  emphasises  this.  It  is  faith  in  Christ  which vol.  IV.  — 14   210  WOBD  STUDIES   IN   THE  NEW  TESTAMENT.         [Ch.  L  sets  one  free  from  the  law.  Here,  the  man  for  whom  the  law is  not  made  (ver.  9)  is  the  man  who  is  ethically  conformed  to the  norm  of  sound  teaching.  The  two  conceptions  do  not exclude  each  other :  the  sound  teaching  is  according  to  the gospel  (ver.  11),  but  the  point  of  emphasis  is  shifted.  11.  According  to.  The  connection  is  with  the  whole  fore- going statement  about  the  law  and  its  application,  ver.  9  S. The  writer  substantiates  what  he  has  just  said  about  the  law, by  a  reference  to  the  gospel.     Comp.  Rom.  ii.  16.

Gospel  of  God  is a  Pauline  phrase  ;  but  ^MKcipio^  blessed  is  not  used  of  God  by Paul,  nor  elsewhere  outside  of  the  Pastorals,  where  it  occurs twice,  here  and  ch.  vi.  15.

The  sense  of  the  whole  passage  is  : \"  I  commit  this  charge  unto  thee  in  accordance  with  prophetic intimations  which  I  formerly  received  concerning  thee.\" Prophecy  is  ranked  among  the  foremost  of  the  special  spirit- ual endowments  enumerated  by  Paul.  See  Rom.  xii.  6 ; 1  Cor.  xii.  10 ;  xiii.  2,  8 ;  xiv.  6,  22.  In  1  Cor.  xii.  28 ; Eph.  iv.  11,  prophets  come  next  after  apostles  in  the  list  of those  whom  God  has  appointed  in  the  church.  In  Eph.  ii. 20,  believers,  Jew  and  Gentile,  are  built  upon  the  foundation of  the  apostles  and  prophets.  According  to  1  Tim.  iv.  14, prophecy  has  previously  designated  Timothy  as  the  recipient of  a  special  spiritual  gift ;  and  the  prophecies  in  our  passage are  the  single  expressions  or  detailed  contents  of  the  prophecy mentioned  there.

The  verb  signifies  to faU  in  with  a  person;  to  draw  near  so  as  to  converse  familiarly. Hence,  Ivrev^i^  is  not  properly  intercession  in  the  accepted sense  of  that  term,  but  rather  approach  to  God  in  free  and familiar  prayer.  'EvruT^cfi/ciy  in  the  passages  cited  is  not  to make  intercession^  but  to  intervene^  interfere.  Thus  in  Rom. viii.  26,  it  is  not  that  the  Spirit  pleads  in  our  behalf,  but  that he  throws  himself  into  our  case  ;  takes  part  in  it.  So  Heb. vii.  25 :  not  that  Jesus  is  ever  interceding  for  us,  but  that  he is  eternally  meeting  us  at  every  point,  and  intervening  in all  our  affairs  for  our  benefit.

(6)  To  let  dovon  or  lower^  jcard  having  its  primary  sense of  dovm.  (c)  Metaphorical,  derived  from  the  preceding,  to  check  or  repress. Thus  Acts  ziz.  25, 36.

From  these  data  two  possible  meanings  are  drawn:  (1)  dress^ attire.  So  Hesychius  (rtptfioMj  garment)  and  Suidas  {vroXii  raiment).  It  is used  in  Isa.  Ixi.  3  as  the  translation  of  r^grs  covering,  wrapping.  The  root ath,  in  every  case,  points  to  veiling.  Plutarch  (Pericles,  6)  has  jraraoroX^ repi/SoX^f  arrangement  of  dress ;  and  Josephus,  B.  J.  ii.  8,  4,  KaraaroMi  koL vx^V^  fff^fMTos  disposition  and  equipment  of  body,  which  phrase  is  explained by  the  following  reference  to  details  of  dress.  It  must  be  admitted,  how- ever, that,  with  the  exception  of  Isa.  bd.  3,  there  is  no  instance  of  the  abso- lute use  of  KtLTtLffTo\\ii  in  the  sense  of  dress.  The  meaning  in  Plutarch  is clearly  arrangement,  and  in  Josephus,  o'x^A^  °^y  ^  rendered  dress,  while KaroffToXii  probably  means  the  general  arrangement  of  the  person.  It  is quite  possible  that  from  the  use  of  jcarcM-roX^  in  these  connections,  it  may have  come  to  mean  dress  by  itself.  A  possible  analogy  is  suggested  by  the English  attire,  from  the  old  French  atirier  or  atirer,  to  arrange,  equip,  decl\\ dress,  cognate  with  Provencal  atierar  (d  tire),  to  bring  into  row  or  order. The  sense  ot  adjusting  or  regulating  runs  into  that  of  adorning.  The  context here,  which  refers  to  details  of  apparel,  the  fact  that  both  Paul  and  Peter specifically  deal  vnth  the  subject  of  female  attire,  the  clear  usage  in  Isaiah, the  association  of  jcarcMroXi^  with  dress,  and  the  definitions  of  the  old  lexi« cographers,  all  seem  to  point  to  the  meaning  apparel.

(4)  The  subject  of  acodi^aeTai  shall  be  saved  is  the  same  as that  of  iv  irapaficurei  yiyovev  hath  fallen  into  transgression.  A common  explanation  is  that  yvvi^  is  to  be  taken  in  its  generic sense  as  referring  to  all  Christian  mothers,  who  will  be  saved in  fulfilling  their  proper  destiny  and  acquiescing  in  all  the conditions  of  a  Christian  woman's  life,  instead  of  attempting to  take  an  active  part  as  teachers  or  otherwise  in  public religious  assemblies.  On  the  other  hand,  the  woman^  Eve,  may be  regarded  as  including  all  the  Christian  mothers.  Notice the  change  to  the  plural,  \"  if  they  continue.\"  She,  though  she fell  into  transgression,  shall  be  saved  \"  by  the  childbearing  \" (Gen.  iii.  15) ;  that  is,  by  the  relation  in  which  the  woman stood  to  the  Messiah.

The  term  hrCa-' Koiro^  was  not  furnished  by  the  gospel  tradition  :  it  did  not come  from  the  Jewish  synagogue,  and  it  does  not  appear  in Paul's  lists  of  those  whom  God  has  set  in  the  church  (1  Cor. xii.  28 ;  Eph.  iv.  11).  Its  adoption  came  about  in  a  natural way.  Just  as  senatys,  yepova^a  and  irpeafivrepo^  passed  into official  designations  through  the  natural  association  of  au- thority with  age,  so  iTrla-teowo^  would  be,  almost  inevitably, the  designation  of  a  superintendent.  This  process  of  natural selection  was  probably  aided  by  the  familiar  use  of  the  title in  the  clubs  and  guilds  to  designate  functions  analogous  to those  of  the  ecclesiastical  administrator.  The  title  can  hardly be  traced  to  the  O.  T.     There  are  but  two  passages  in  LXX   228  WOBD  STUDIES  IK  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT.

Is  the  injunction  aimed  (a)  at  immor- alities respecting  marriage  —  concubinage,  etc.,  or  (b)  at polygamy,  or  (e)  at  remarriage  after  death  or  divorce  ?  The last  is  probably  meant.  Much  of  the  difficulty  arises  from the  assumption  that  the  Pastorals  were  written  by  Paul.  In that  case  his  views  seem  to  conflict.  See  Rom.  vii.  2,  3 ; 1  Cor.  vii.  39 ;  viii.  8,  9,  where  Paul  declares  that  widows  are free  to  marry  again,  and  puts  widows  and  virgins  on  the  same level ;  and  comp.  1  Tim.  v.  9,  according  to  which  a  widow  is to  be  enrolled  only  on  the  condition  of  having  been  the  wife of  but  one  man.  The  Pauline  view  is  modified  in  detail  by the  writer  of  the  Pastorals.  Paul,  while  asserting  that marriage  is  right  and  honourable,  regards  celibacy  as  the higher  state  (1  Cor.  vii.  1,  7,  26,  34,  37,  38).  In  this  the Pastoral  writer  does  not  follow  him  (see  1  Tim.  ii.  15 ;  iii.  4, 12 ;  iv.  3 ;  v.  10, 14).  The  motive  for  marriage,  namely,  pro- tection against  incontinency,  which  is  adduced  by  Paul  in 1  Cor.  vii.  2,  9,  is  given  in  1  Tim.  v.  11-14.  As  in  Paul, the  married  state  is  honourable,  for  Bishops,  Deacons,  and Presbyters  are  married  (1  Tim.  iii.  2,  12;  Tit.  i.  6),  and the  honour  of  childbearing  conferred  upon  the  mother  of  *  See  IntrodactioQ,  and  Excursus  on  **  Bishops  and  Deacons**  in  Inter' national  Commentary  on  FhUippianB  and  PhUemon.

While  Paul  advises  against  second  marriages (1  Cor.  vii.  8,  9, 27, 89,  40),  in  the  Pastorals  emphasis  is  laid only  on  the  remarriage  of  church-officers  and  church-widows. In  the  Pastorals  we  see  a  reflection  of  the  conditions  of  the earlier  post-apostolic  age,  when  a  non-Pauline  asceticism  was showing  itself  (see  1  Tim.  iv.  8,  4,  8  ;  Tit.  i.  15).  The  op- position to  second  marriage  became  very  strong  in  the  latter part  of  the  second  century.  It  was  elevated  into  an  article of  faith  by  the  Montanists,  and  was  emphasised  by  TertuUian, and  by  Athenagoras,  who  called  second  marriage  **a  specious adultery\"  (jevTrpeirffi  fMixiCa).*  Vigilant  (yrf^dXiop).

This  admonition  is  cited  by  some  writers  in  support  of  the view  that  the  original  hri(rKoiro^  was  simply  a  financial  officer. It  is  assumed  that  it  was  prompted  by  the  special  tempta- tions which  attached  to  the  financial  function.  Admitting that  the  episcopal  function  may  have  included  the  financial interests  of  the  church,  it  could  not  have  been  confined  to these.  It  can  hardly  be  supposed  that,  in  associations  dis- tinctively moral  and  religious,  one  who  bore  the  title  of overseer  should  have  been  concerned  only  with  the  material side  of  church  life.*  4.

The  use  of  hidfioXo^  as  an adjective  is  peculiar  to  the  Pastorals  (see  1  Tim.  iii.  11 ; 2  Tim.  iii.  3 ;  Tit.  ii.  3),  and  occurs  nowhere  else  in  N.  T., and  not  in  LXX.  The  phrase  judgment  of  the  devil  probably means  the  accusing  judgment  of  the  devil,  and  not  the  judg- ment passed  upon  the  devil.  In  Apoc.  xii.  10  Satan  is  called the  accuser  of  the  brethren.  In  1  Cor.  v.  5 ;  1  Tim.  i.  20,  men are  given  over  to  Satan  for  judgment.  In  ver.  7  the  genitive hiafiSKov  is  clearly  subjective.  In  this  chapter  it  appears  that a  Christian  can  fall  into  the  reproach  of  the  devil  (comp.  Jude 9 ;  2  Pet.  ii.  11),  the  mare  of  the  devil  (comp.  2  Tim.  ii.  26), and  ihQ  judgment  of  the  devil.   Cta.  m.]  THB  FIRST  EPISTLE  TO  TIMOTHY.  288  7.

The  office  of  Deacon  appears  in  the  Pastor- als, but  not  in  Paul's  letters,  with  the  single  exception  of Philip,  i.  1,  where  the  Deacons  do  not  represent  an  ecclesias- tical office,  though  they  mark  an  advance  toward  it.  Clem- ent of  Rome  (ad  CorirUh.  xlii,  xliv)  asserts  their  apostolic appointment.  But  the  evidence  at  our  command  does  not bear  out  the  view  that  the  institution  of  the  diaconate  is described  in  Acts  vi.  1-6.  The  terms  Biokovo^  and  huucovla are,  in  the  Pauline  writings,  common  expressions  of  servants and  service  either  to  Christ  or  to  others.  Paul  applies  these terms  to  his  own  ministry  and  to  that  of  his  associates. iiuucopCa  is  used  of  the  service  of  the  apostles.  Acts  i.  25 ; vi.  4.  liidKovo^  is  used  of  Paul  and  Apollos  (1  Cor.  iii.  5)  ; of  Christ  (Gral.  ii.  17;  Rom.  xv.  8)  ;  of  the  civil  ruler  (Rom. xiii.  4)  ;  of  ministers  of  Satan  (2  Cor.  xi.  15).

In  a  pure  conscience  (jh  tcaOapa  avveiBiia-ei).  Comp. 2  Tim.  i.  8,  6, 19.  Const,  with  holding.  The  emphasis  of the  passage  is  on  these  words.  They  express  conscientious purity  and  sincerity  in  contrast  with  those  who  are  described as  branded  in  their  aum  conscience^  and  thus  causing  their  fol- lowers to  fall  away  from  the  faith  (ch.  iv.  1,  2).  The  passage illustrates  the  peculiar  treatment  of  ^^  faith ''  in  these  Epis- tles, in  emphasising  its  ethical  aspect  and  its  ethical  environ- ment. This  is  not  contrary  to  Paul's  teaching,  nor  does  it go  to  the  extent  of  substituting  morals  for  faith  as  the  condi- tion of  salvation  and  eternal  life.  See  2  Tim.  i.  9 ;  ii.  1 ; Tit.  iii.  6.  None  the  less,  there  is  a  strong  and  habitual emphasis  on  good  works  (see  1  Tim.  ii.  10 ;  v.  10 ;  vi.  18 ; 2  Tim.  ii.  21 ;  iii.  17 ;  Tit.  i.  16 ;  ii.  7,  14  ;  iii.  1,  8,  14), and  faith  is  placed  in  a  series  of  practical  duties  (see  1  Tim. i.  5,  14;  ii.  16;  iv.  12;  2  Tim.  i.  18;  1  Tim.  i.  19;  ii.  7; iii.  9;  vi.  11 ;  2  Tim.  ii.  22;  iii.  10).  \"Holding  the  mys- tery of  the  faith  in  a  pure  conscience\"  is  a  significant  associ- ation of  faith  with  ethics.  As  Weiss  puts  it :  '^  It  is  as  if  the pure  conscience  were  the  vessel  in  which  the  mystery  of  the faith  is  preserved.\"  The  idea  is  sound  and  valuable.  A merely  intellectual  attitude  toward  the  mystery  which,  in every  age,  attaches  to  the  faith,  will  result  in  doubt,  quest- ioning, and  wordy  strife  (see  1  Tim.  vi.  4 ;  2  Tim.  ii.  28 ; Tit.  iii.  9),  sometimes  in  moral  laxity,  sometimes  in  despair. Loyalty  and  duty  to  God  are  compatible  with  more  or  less ignorance  concerning  the  mystery.  An  intellect,  however powerful  and  active,  joined  with  an  impure  conscience,  cannot solve  but  only  aggravates  the  mystery  ;  whereas  a  pure  and loyal  conscience,  and  a  frank  acceptance  of  imposed  duty along  with  mystery,  puts  one  in  the  best  attitude  for  attain- ing whatever  solution  is  possible.

But  the  injunction is  thrown  incidentally  into  the  admonition  concerning  Dea- cons, which  is  resumed  at  ver.  12 ;  and  if  an  official  class  were intended  we  should  expect  something  more  specific  than ywauca'i  women  or  wives  without  the  article.  A  Deacon whose  wife  is  wanting  in  the  qualities  required  in  him,  is not  to  be  chosen.  She  would  sustain  an  active  relation  to his  office,  and  by  her  ministries  would  increase  his  efficiency, and  by  frivolity,  slander,  or  intemperance,  would  bring  him and  his  office  into  disrepute.  18.

Others  (as  De  Wette,  Ellicott,  Pfleiderer)  refer it  to  a  high  grade  in  the  future  life,  which  Holtzmann  sar- castically describes  as  a  ladder-round  in  heaven  {eine  Staffel im  Himmel).

Ch.  m.]  THE  FIB8T  EPISTLE  TO  TIMOTHT.  289  is  quite  beside  the  mark  to  press  the  architectural  metaphor into  detail.  By  giving  to  iBpaioi>fia  the  sense  of  ttay  or  prop^ the  use  of  the  two  words  for  the  same  general  idea  is  readily explained.  The  church  is  the  pillar  of  the  truth,  and  the function  of  the  pillar  is  to  support.^  16.  Without  controversy  (ofioXoyov/jJpm^y.  Lit.  confess- edly.    N.  T.^.  The  mystery  of  godliness  (t6  r^  evae/Seia^  iMnrrripiov). (a)  The  connection  of  thought  is  with  the  truth  (ver.  15), and  the  words  mystery  of  godliness  are  a  paraphrase  of  that word.  The  church  is  the  pillar  and  stay  of  the  truth,  and the  truth  constitutes  the  mystery  of  godliness.  (6)  The contents  of  this  truth  or  mystery  is  Christ,  revealed  in  the gospel  as  the  Saviour  from  ungodliness,  the  norm  and  inspir- ation of  godliness,  the  divine  life  in  man,  causing  him  to live  unto  God  as  Christ  did  and  does  (Rom.  vi.  10).  See ch.  i.  15 ;  ii.  5 ;  Col.  i.  26,  27.  According  to  the  Fourth Gospel,  Christ  is  himself  the  truth  (J.  xiv.  6).  The  mystery of  godliness  is  the  substance  of  piety  =  mystery  of  the  faith (ver.  9).  (c)  The  truth  is  called  a  mystery  because  it  was, historically,  bidden,  until  revealed  in  the  person  and  work  of Christ;  also  because  it  is  concealed  from  human  wisdom, and  apprehended  only  by  faith  in  the  revelation  of  God through  Christ,  (d)  The  genitive,  of  godliness^  is  possess- ive. The  mystery  of  godliness  is  the  truth  which  pertains or  belongs  to  godliness.  It  is  not  the  property  of  worldly wisdom.  Cheat  Qfidya^  means  important,  weighty^  as  Eph. V.  32.  God  (^6^).     But  the  correct  reading  is  d?  who.f    The  •  Dr.  BriggB,  Messiah  of  the  Apostles^  p.  229,  thinks  that  the  whole  church is  conceived  as  a  pillar  uplifting  a  platform  or  basis  {Hpalufta)  on  which  the truth  rests.  Besides  being  contrary  to  the  true  sense  of  HpaUafta^  this  explan- ation compels  a  yery  awkward  metaphor.  t  Those  who  are  interested  in  the  details  of  the  controyersy  oyer  this  read- ing, may  consult  8.

[Ch.  m.  antecedent  of  this  relative  is  not  myBtery^  as  if  Christ  were styled  \"  the  mystery,\"  but  the  relative  refers  to  Christ  as  an antecedent ;  and  the  abruptness  of  its  introduction  may  be explained  by  the  fact  that  it  and  the  words  which  follow were  probably  taken  from  an  ancient  credal  hymn.  In  the earlier  Christian  ages  it  was  not  unusual  to  employ  verse  or rhythm  for  theological  teaching  or  statement.  The  heretics propounded  their  peculiar  doctrines  in  psalms.  Clement  of Alexandria  wrote  a  hymn  in  honour  of  Christ  for  the  use  of catechumens,  and  Arius  embodied  his  heresy  in  his  ThcUi(ij which  was  sung  in  the  streets  and  taverns  of  Alexandria. The  Muratorian  Canon  was  probably  composed  in  verse.  In the  last  quarter  of  the  fourth  century,  there  are  two  metrical lists  of  Scripture  by  Amphilochius  and  Gregory  Nazianzen.*  Was  manifest  (J^av€p&0fji).

Concerning  the  whole  phrase  it  is  to  be  said  :  (a)  That  the two  clauses,  man\\fested  in  the  fleshy  justified  in  the  Spirit^ exhibit  a  contrast  between  two  aspects  of  the  life  of  Christ.

The  same  verb  is  used  of  the  appearance  of the  risen  Christ  to  different  persons  or  parties  (1  Cor.  xv. 5-8).  The  reference  of  the  words  cannot  be  determined with  certainty.  They  seem  to  imply  some  great,  majestic occasion,  rather  than  the  angelic  manifestations  during Jesus'  earthly  life.  Besides,  on  these  occasions,  the  angels appeared  to  him,  not  he  to  them.  The  reference  is  probably to  his  appearance  in  the  heavenly  world  after  his  ascension, when  the  glorified  Christ,  having  been  triumphantly  vindi- cated in  his  messianic  work  and  trial,  presented  himself  to the  heavenly  hosts.

Christ's  existence  before  his  incarnation  was  purely  spiritual  (iv  i ftan).  He  was  in  the  form  of  God  (Philip.  iL  6)  :  He  was  the  effulgence of  God's  glory  and  the  express  image  of  his  substance  (Heb.  i.  8),  and God  is  spirit  (J.  iy.  24).  From  this  condition  he  came  into  manifestation  in  the  flesh  (h  oopict ). He  became  man  and  entered  into  human  conditions  (Philip,  ii.  7,  8). Under  these  human  conditions  the  attributes  of  his  essential  spiritual  per- sonality were  yelled.  He  did  not  appear  to  men  what  he  really  was.  He was  not  recognised  by  them  as  he  who  '*  was  in  the  beginning  with  God  \" (J.  i.  1,  2) ;  as  **  the  image  of  the  inyisible  God  \"  (Col.  i.  15) ;  as  one  with God  (J.  X.  30 ;  xiy.  9) ;  as  he  who  had  all  power  in  heaven  and  earth (Matt,  xxviii.  18) ;  who  was  **  before  all  things  and  by  whom  all  things consist \"  (Col.  i.  17) ;  who  was  \"  the  king  of  the  ages  \"  (1  Tim.  i.  17).  On the  contrary,  he  was  regarded  as  an  impostor,  a  usurper,  and  a  blasphemer. He  was  hated,  persecuted,  and  finally  murdered.  He  was  poor,  tempts**!, and  tried,  a  man  of  sorrows.  The  justification  or  vindication  of  what  he  really  was  did  not  therefoie come  out  of  the  fleshly  sphere.  He  was  not  justified  in  the  ffesh.  It  came out  of  the  sphere  of  his  spiritual  being.  Glimpses  of  this  pneumatic  life (iv  ifKCv/iari)  flashed  out  during  his  life  in  the  flesh.  By  his  exalted  and spotless  character,  by  his  works  of  love  and  power,  by  his  words  of  au- thority, in  his  baptism  and  transfiguration,  he  was  vindicated  as  being what  he  essentially  was  and  what  he  openly  claimed  to  be.  These  justifi- cations were  revelations,  expressions,  and  witnesses  of  his  original,  essential spiritual  and  divine  quality ;  of  the  native  glory  which  he  had  with  the Father  before  the  world  was.    It  was  the  Spirit  that  publicly  indorsed  him  *  This  explanation  destroys  the  chronological  order,  since  the  appearing to  angels,  the  preaching  among  the  nations,  and  the  being  believed  on  in  the world,  followed  the  ascension.  But  I  am  not  sure  that  the  preservation  of the  chronological  order  is  absolutely  essential,  or  that  it  might  not  have  been violated  in  the  credal  hymn.  The  fact  of  the  formal  use  of  dpaXafifidpeiv  by Luke  to  describe  the  ascension  seems  to  me  to  be  significant,  especially  in view  of  the  nimierous  and  striking  affinities  of  vocabulary  in  Luke,  Acts,  and the  Pastorals.  Besides,  there  is  absolutely  nothing  else  to  which  the  word can  naturally  be  referred  here.  The  explanation  to  which  von  Soden  in- clines, that  Christ  was  taken  up  in  glory  by  Christians,  either  in  the  ascrip- tion of  glory  to  him  or  in  the  glory  thereby  imparted  to  men,  seems  most unnatural  and  forced.   Ch.  IV.]  the  first  epistle  to  TDfOTHT.  248  (J.  i.  32,  33) :  the  words  which  he  spake  were  spirit  and  life  (J.  yi.  63) : he  cast  oat  demons  in  the  Spirit  of  God  (Matt.  xii.  28) :  his  whole  earthly manifestation  was  in  demonstration  of  the  Spirit  These  Tarious  demon- strations decisiyely  justified  his  claims  in  the  eyes  of  many.  His  disciples confessed  him  as  the  Christ  of  Grod  (L.  ix.  20)  :  some  of  the  people  said **  this  is  the  Christ \"  (J.  vii.  41) :  others  suspected  that  he  was  such (J.  iv.  29).  Whether  or  not  men  acknowledged  his  claims,  they  felt  the power  of  his  unique  personality.  They  were  astonished  at  his  teaching, for  he  taught  them  as  one  haying  authority  (Matt.  yii.  28,  29).  Then  followed  the  more  decisiye  yindication  in  his  resurrection  from the  dead.  Here  the  work  of  the  Spirit  is  distinctly  recognised  by  Paul, Rom.  i.  4.  See  also  Rom.  yiii.  11.  In  the  period  between  his  resurrection and  ascension  his  pneumatic  life  came  into  clearer  manifestation,  and added  to  the  yindication  furnished  in  his  life  and  resurrection.  He seemed  to  liye  on  the  border-line  between  the  natural  and  the  spiritual world,  and  the  powers  of  the  spiritual  world  were  continually  crossing  the line  and  reyealing  themselves  in  him.  In  the  apostolic  preaching,  the  appeal  to  the  yindication  of  Christ  by the  Spirit  is  clear  and  unequivocal.  The  spiritual  nourishment  of  be- lievers is  '*  the  supply  of  the  Spirit  of  Jesus  Christ \"  (Philip,  i.  19) :  the Holy  Spirit  is  called  ''the  Spirit  of  Christ\"  (Rom.  yiiL  9;  GaL  iv.  6) : Paul  identifies  Christ  personally  with  the  Spirit  (2  Cor.  iiL  17) ;  and  in Rom.  yiii  9,  10,  «« Spirit  of  God,\"  \"Spirit  of  Christ,\"  and  \"Christ\"  are used  as  convertible  terms.  The  indwelling  of  the  Spirit  of  Christ  is  the test  and  yindication  of  belonging  to  Christ  (Rom.  yiii.  9).  Thus,  though put  to  death  in  the  flesh,  in  the  Spirit  Christ  is  vindioa^  as  the  Son  of Ood,  the  Christ  of  God,  the  manifestation  of  God.  ",

There  can  be  no doubt  of  the  presence  of  Jews  in  Crete.  Tacitus  (^ffiet.  y.  2) eyen  makes  the  absurd  statement  that  the  Jews  were  Cretan exiles ;  and  that  from  their  residence  in  the  yicinity  of  the Cretan  Moimt  Ida  they  were  called  Idaei^  whence  Judaei. There  appears  to  haye  been  some  confusion  between  the  Pal- estinians and  the  Philistines  —  the  Cherethim  or  Cherethitee^ who,  in  Ezek.  xxy.  16  ;  Zeph.  ii.  5  are  called  in  LXX  ILprfr^. Jews  were  in  the  island  in  considerable  numbers  between  the death  of  Alexander  and  the  final  destruction  of  Jerusalem. In  1  Mace.  xy.  28  the  Cretan  city  of  Gortyna  is  mentioned among  the  places  to  which  letters  were  written  by  Lucius,  the Roman  consul,  on  behalf  of  the  Jews,  when  Simon  Maccabaeus   836  WORD  STUDIES  IN  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT.

Philo  (^Leg.  ad  Oai.  §  86)  makes the  Jewish  envoys  say  to  Caligula  that  all  the  principal islands  of  the  Mediterranean,  including  Crete,  were  full  of Jews.  11.

A  legend relates  that,  going  by  his  father's  order  in  search  of  a  sheep, he  lay  down  in  a  cave,  where  he  fell  asleep  and  slept  for  fif^ years.  He  then  appeared  with  long  hair  and  a  flowing  beard, and  with  an  astonishing  knowledge  of  medicine  and  natural history.  It  was  said  that  he  had  the  power  of  sending  his soul  out  of  his  body  and  recalling  it  at  pleasure,  and  that  he had  familiar  intercourse  with  the  gods  and  possessed  the power  of  prophecy.  He  was  sent  for  to  Athens  at  the  request of  the  inhabitants,  in  order  to  pave  the  way  for  the  legislation of  Solon  by  purifications  and  propitiatory  sacrifices,  intended to  allay  the  feuds  and  party-discussions  which  prevailed  in the  city.  In  return  for  his  services  he  refused  the  Athenians' offers  of  wealth  and  public  honours,  and  asked  only  a  branch of  the  sacred  olive,  and  a  decree  of  perpetual  friendship   Gb.

He  is  said  to  have  lived to  the  age  of  157  years,  and  divine  honours  were  paid  him  by the  Cretans  after  his  death.  He  composed  a  Theogony,  and poems  concerning  religious  mysteries.  He  wrote  also  a  poem on  the  Argonautic  Expedition,  and  other  works.  Jerome mentions  his  treatise  On  Oraelen  and  Jte^onseM^  from  which the  quotation  in  this  verse  is  supposed  to  have  been  taken. According  to  Diogenes  Laertius  (i.  10)  Epimenides,  in  order to  remove  a  pestilence  from  Athens,  turned  some  sheep  loose at  the  Areopagus,  and  wherever  they  lay  down  sacrificed  to the  proper  god  :  whence,  he  says,  there  are  still  to  be  found, in  different  demes  of  the  Athenians,  anonymous  altars.

While  it  cannot  be  as- serted that  the  heretical  characteristics  noted  in  the  Pastoral Epistles  point  collectively  to  any  specific  form  of  error,  it  is true,  nevertheless,  that  certain  characteristics  of  the  economy of  grace  are  emphasised,  which  are  directly  opposed  to  Gnostic ideas.  Thus  the  exhortation  that  supplications  be  made  for all  men,  supported  by  the  statement  that  God  wills  that  all men  should  be  saved  and  come  to  the  knowledge  of  the  truth (1  Tim.  ii.  1,  4),  is  in  the  teeth  of  the  Gnostic  distinction between  men  of  spirit  and  men  of  matter,  and  of  the  Gnostic principle  that  the  knowledge  (jhrlyiftn^i,^^  of  truth  was  only for  a  limited,  intellectual  class.  To  the  same  effect  is  the frequent  recurrence  of  aZZ,  for  all^  in  connection  with  the saving  and  enlightening  gifts  of  God  (1  Tim.  ii.  6 ;  iv.  10  ; vi.  13 ;  Tit.  ii.  11).

Rom.  vi.  3-5.  It  is  true  that  nothing  is  said  of  faith; but  baptism  implies  faith  on  the  part  of  its  recipient.  It  has no  regenerating  effect  apart  from  faith ;  and  the  renewing  of the  Holy  Spirit  is  not  bestowed  if  faith  be  wanting.  Renewing  (^avaKcuvwr&o^^.

Others  con- strue with  renewing  only,  avcucaivdkreaf^  being  dependent  on &A;  through  the  laver  of  regeneration  and  (through)  the renewing,  etc.  The  former  seems  the  more  probable.

THE  EPISTLE  TO  THE  HEBREW&   INTRODUCTION.   **  Who  wrote  the  Epistle  God  only  knows.\"  Such  was  the verdict  of  Origen,  and  modem  criticism  has  gotten  no  farther. That  it  is  not  the  work  of  Paul  is  the  almost  unanimous  judg- ment of  modern  scholars.  Its  authenticity  as  a  Pauline  writ- ing has  been  challenged  from  the  earliest  times.  In  the Eastern  church,  both  Clement  and  Origen  regarded  the Greek  Epistle  as  Paul's  only  in  a  secondary  sense ;  Clement holding  that  it  was  written  by  Paul  in  Hebrew  and  translated by  Luke.  Origen  knew  only  that  some  held  Clement  of  Rome and  some  Luke  to  be  the  author.  Its  position  and  designation in  the  Peshitto  Version  shows  that  it  was  regarded  as  not strictly  one  of  Paul's  epistles,  but  as  an  appendix  to  the  col- lection. Eusebius's  testimony  is  inconsistent.  He  holds  a Hebrew  original,  and  a  translation  by  Clement,  and  cites  the letter  as  Pauline  (^H.E.  88).  Again,  he  expressly  classifies it  with  antilegomena  (vi.  13)  ;  but  in  iii.  25  he  evades  the question,  naming  the  Pauline  Epistles  as  Juymoloffumena^  but without  stating  their  number.  In  the  West  the  epistle  was  known  to  Clement  of  Rome, who  frequently  quotes  it,  but  without  naming  the  author. The  Pauline  authorship  was  expressly  denied  by  Hippolytus  : the  Muratorian  Canon  does  not  mention  it,  and  reckons  only seven  churches  to  which  Paul  wrote :  TertuUian  in  Africa apparently  knew  nothing  of  a  Pauline  Epistle  to  the  Hebrews, but  spoke  of  an  Epistle  of  Barnabas  to  the  Hebrews.  It  was not  recognised  by  Cyprian.  From  the  fourth  century  its canonical  authority  was  admitted  in  the  West,  partly  on  S61   862      DTTBODUCnON  TO  THE  EPI8TLB  TO  THE  HEBREWS.  the  assumption  pf  its  Pauline  authorship ;  but  the  influ- ence of  the  earlier  suspicion  remained,  and  Jerome  declared that  the  custom  of  the  Latins  did  not  receive  it  as  St.  Paulas. Augustine  agreed  substantially  with  Jerome.  It  was  author* ised  as  canonical  by  two  councils  of  Carthage  (897,  419  A.D.); but  the  language  of  the  former  council  was  peculiar :  ^^  Thir- teen Epistles  of  Paul,  and  one  of  the  same  to  the  Hebrews.\" The  decree  of  the  latter  council  was  ^^  fourteen  Epistles  of Paul.\"  From  this  time  the  canonical  authority  and  authorship  of the  epistle  were  generally  accepted  until  the  age  of  the Reformation,  when  the  old  doubts  were  revived  by  Cajetan and  Erasmus.  The  council  of  Trent  (1645-1568)  decreed fourteen  Pauline  Epistles ;  yet  different  views  have  been current  among  Roman  Catholic  theologians,  as  Bellarmine, Estius,  and  others.  Luther  denied  the  Pauline  authorship, and  placed  the  epistle  along  with  James,  Jude,  and  the  Apoc- alypse, after  *Hhe  right-certain,  main  books  of  the  New Testament.\"  Melanchthon  treated  it  as  anonymous.  The Magdeburg  Centuriators  (1559-1574)  denied  that  it  was Paul's,  as  did  Calvin.  Under  Beza's  influence  it  was  separ- ated from  the  Pauline  letters  in  the  Grallican  Confession (1571).  The  Belgic  and  Helvetic  Confessions  declared  it Pauline.  The  hypothesis  of  the  Pauline  authorship  was  con- clusively overthrown  by  Bleek  in  1868.  The  conclusion  of  modem  scholarship  rests  upon : (1)  The  Style  and  Diction.  —  While  Paul's  style  is marked  by  frequent  irregularities,  anacolutha,  unclosed  par- entheses, and  mixed  metaphors,  this  epistle  is  written  in  a flowing,  symmetrical,  and  artistically  elaborated  style.  The difference  is  as  marked  as  that  between  a  chapter  of  Gibbon and  one  of  Sartor  Resartus.  The  rhetorical  art  of  Hebrews appears  in  the  careful  arrangement  of  the  words,  the  rhyth- mical structure  of  sentences,  and  the  sonorous  compounds. The  paragraphs  are  sometimes  arranged  in  a  regular  series  of premises  and  conclusions,  with  parentheses  which  do  not  lose their  connection  with  the  main  topic,  while  the  whole  is developed  in  regular  sequence,  without  anacolutha.   intboduction  to  thb  epistlb  to  the  hebrews.    368  (2)  The  Methods  op  Thought  and  the  Points  of View.  —  These  differ  from  those  of  the  Pauline  Epistles. The  two  do  not  materially  disagree.  They  reach,  substan« tially,  the  same  conclusions,  but  by  different  processes  and from  different  positions.  The  points  of  emphasis  differ. Topics  which,  in  the  Pauline  letters,  are  in  the  foreground, in  Hebrews  fall  into  the  shade  or  are  wholly  passed  over, (a)  The  conception  of  faith.  In  Paul,  faith  is  belief  in  Jesus Christ  as  a  means  of  justification,  involving  a  sharp  oppo- sition to  the  works  of  the  law  as  meriting  salvation.  In Hebrews,  faith  is  trust  in  the  divine  promises  as  distin- guished from  seeing  their  realisation,  a  phase  of  faith  which appears  rarely  in  Paul.  Both  agree  that  faith  is  the  only true  medium  of  righteousness  ;  but  Hebrews  sets  forth  two great  factors  of  faith,  namely,  that  God  t«,  and  that  he  is  a rewarder  of  them  which  diligently  seek  him.  (i)  The  mode  of  presenting  the  contrcist  between  the  covenant of  worke  and  the  covenant  of  grace  through  faith.  Both  Paul and  the  author  of  Hebrews  recognise  a  relation  and  connection between  the  two  covenants.  The  one  prefigures  and  pre- pares the  way  for  the  other.  The  Christian  church  is  \"  the Israel  of  God,\"  \"  the  people  of  God,\"  \"  the  seed  of  Abraham.\" Both  teach  that  forgiveness  of  sin  and  true  fellowship  with God  cannot  be  attained  through  the  law,  and  that  Christian- ity represents  the  life-giving  Spirit,  and  Judaism  the  letter which  killeth.  Both  assert  the  abrogation  of  the  old  coven- ant by  Christ.  Paul,  however,  views  Judaism  almost  entirely as  a  law  to  be  fulfilled  by  men  ;  while  our  writer  regards  it as  a  system  of  institutions  designed  to  represent  a  fellowship between  God  and  his  worshippers.  Paul,  accordingly,  shows that  the  law  cannot  put  man  into  right  relation  with  God, because  man  cannot  fulfil  it ;  while  Hebrews  shows  that  the institutions  of  the  old  covenant  cannot,  by  reason  of  their imperfection,  establish  a  real  fellowship  with  God.  To  Paul, the  reason  why  the  old  covenant  did  not  satisfy  lay,  not  in the  law,  which  ^^  is  holy  and  just  and  good,\"  but  in  the  rela- tion of  man  to  the  law,  as  unable  to  fulfil  its  demands.  It oannot  effect  justification,  and  it  works  to  make  man  con-   864     IKTBODUCnON  TO  THE  EPI8TIJE  TO  THB  HEBBKW8.  Bcious  of  his  sin,  and  to  drive  him  to  the  true  source  of  right- eousness. To  our  writer  the  reason  is  to  be  sought  in  the fact  that  the  atoning  and  purifying  institutions  of  the  law cannot  remove  the  sins  which  prevent  fellowship  with  Grod.  From  Paul's  point  of  view  he  might  have  been  expected  to show  that,  in  the  Old  Testament  economy,  it  devolved  on  the sacrificial  institution,  centred  in  the  high-priesthood,  to  meet the  want  which  was  not  met  by  legal  obedience.  To  his assertion  that  men  could  not  fulfil  the  demands  of  the  law,  it might  have  been  answered  that  the  sacrifices,  not  in  being works  of  the  law,  but  in  being  ordained  by  God  himself  as atonements  for  sin,  changed  men's  defective  righteousness  into a  righteousness  which  justified  them  before  God.  But  Paul does  not  meet  this.  He  nowhere  shows  the  insufficiency  of the  Old  Testament  sacrifices.  He  does  not  treat  the  doctrine of  the  high-priesthood  of  Christ.  He  regards  the  system  of sacrifices  less  as  a  divinely-ordained  means  of  atonement  than as  a  work  performed  by  men,  and  therefore  in  the  line  of other  works  of  the  law.  This  gap  is  filled  by  the  writer  to  the  Hebrews,  in  showing that  the  ceremonial  economy  did  not  and  could  not  effect true  fellowship  with  God.  He,  no  doubt,  perceived  as  clearly as  Paul  that  the  observance  of  the  ritual  was  of  the  nature of  legal  works  ;  but  he  speaks  of  the  ritual  system  as  only  a presumed  means  of  grace  intended  to  define  and  enforce  the idea  of  fellowship  with  God,  and  to  give  temporary  comfort to  the  worshipper,  but  practically  impotent  to  institute  and maintain  such  fellowship  in  any  true  and  deep  sense.  There- fore he  emphasises  the  topic  of  the  priesthood.  He  dwells on  the  imperfect  and  transient  nature  of  the  priestly  office  : he  shows  that  the  Levitical  priesthood  was  only  a  foreshadow- ing of  a  better  and  permanent  priesthood.  Christ  as  the great  high  priest,  who  appears  nowhere  in  the  Pauline  Epis- tles, is  the  central  figure  in  the  Epistle  to  the  Hebrews.  He treats  of  the  ritual  system  and  its  appliances  as  mere  types of  an  enduring  reality  :  he  characterises  the  whole  body  of Levitical  ordinances  and  ceremonies  as  fleshly  ;  and  through all  nms  the  one,  sad  note,  accentuated   again   and  againt   INTBODUCnOK  TO  THB  KPI8TLB  TO  THB  HEBREWS.      365  ^  they  can  never  take  away  sins  : ''  ^*  they  can  never  make  the comers  thereunto  perfect:''  **they  are  mere  ordinances  of the  flesh,  imposed  until  the  time  of  reformation/'  (c)  The  view  of  the  condition  in  which  the  eubject  of  the law' 9  dominion  is  placed.  To  Paul  it  is  a  condition  of  bond- age, because  the  law  is  a  body  of  demands  which  man  must fulfil  (Rom.  vii.).  To  our  writer  it  is  a  condition  of  unsat- isfied longing  for  forgiveness  and  fellowship,  because  of  the insufficiency  of  the  ritual  atonement.  Accordingly,  Hebrews points  to  the  satisfaction  of  this  longing  in  Christ,  the  great high  priest,  perfecting  by  one  offering  those  who  are  being sanctified,  purging  the  conscience  from  dead  works  to  serve the  living  God.  Paul  points  to  the  fact  that  Christ  has  put an  end  to  the  tyranny  of  the  law,  and  has  substituted  freedom for  bondage.  The  conception  of  freedom  does  not  appear  in Hebrews.  Neither  iKevOepo^^  ikevOepia,  nor  ikeuOepovv  occur in  the  epistle.  (i)  The  doctrine  of  the  resurrection  of  Ohriet.  This  emerges eveiywhere  in  Paul's  epistles.  There  is  but  one  allusion  to it  in  Hebrews  (xiii.  20),  although  it  is  implied  in  the  doctrine of  Christ's  high-priesthood,  he  being  a  priest  ^*  according  to the  power  of  an  indissoluble  life  \"  (vii.  16).  (e)  The  Gentilee.  There  is  no  mention  of  the  Grentiles  in relation  to  the  new  covenant,  a  topic  which  constantly  recurs in  Paul.  (/)  Sin.  Sin  is  not  treated  with  reference  to  its  origin as  by  Paul.  The  vocabulary  of  terms  for  sin  is  smaller  than in  the  Pauline  writings.  (ff)  Repentance.  The  denial  of  the  possibility  of  repentance after  a  lapse  (vi.  4-6,  comp.  x.  26-29)  is  not  Pauline.

(4)  The  General  Scheme  of  Treatment. — This  is broader  than  that  of  Paul,  viewing  man  not  only  in  bis   366      INTBODUCTIOK  TO  THB  EPISTLE  TO  THE  HEBREWS.  relation  to  the  law,  but  to  God's  original  ideal,  and  to  the harmony  with  God's  entire  economy  in  nature  and  revelation. Man,  nature,  history,  alike  illustrate  the  incarnation.  The Son  of  God,  through  whom  the  worlds  were  made,  is  the  heir of  all  things,  and,  as  creator  and  heir,  interprets  all  life.  He not  only  creates,  but  bear$  on  all  things  by  the  word  of  his power  toward  the  consummation — complete  harmony  with  the divine  archetype.  As  high  priest  he  makes  God  and  man  at one  in  every  sphere  of  being.  He  stands  for  the  solidarity  of humanity.  He  is  not  perfected  without  the  community  of  sons (xi.  40).     He  is  himself  a  son,  a  partaker  of  human  nature.  With  Paul,  the  law  is  chiefly  a  law  of  ordinances  to  be replaced  by  the  gospel.  It  is  abolished  in  Christ.  It  cannot be  perfectly  observed.  It  generates  the  knowledge  of  sin. It  cannot  generate  righteousness.  Christianity  is  a  manifesta- tion of  the  righteousness  of  God  apart  from  the  law.  Faith is  counted  for  righteousness  to  him  that  worketh  not  but  be- lieveth.  The  law  works  wrath,  and  is  unto  death.  It  is  sub- sidiary, with  a  special  view  to  the  concrete  development  of  sin.  Equally  our  epistle  shows  the  insufficiency  of  the  law  to reconcile  men  to  God,  but  in  a  different  way.  Paul  emphas- ises the  substitution  of  the  gospel  for  the  law:  Hebrews the  germ  of  a  saving  economy  contained  in  the  law,  and  the necessity  of  its  development  by  the  gospel.  Paul  does  not overlook  the  fact  that  the  law  was  our  pedagogue  to  bring us  to  Christ,  but  he  does  not  show  how,  as  our  writer  does. The  latter  emphasises  the  xmity  of  the  divine  plan,  shows  how the  Levitical  institutions  pointed  forward  to  Christ,  and  how the  heavenly  archetype  was  foreshadowed  in  the  ritual  system. With  all  Paul's  strong  assertion  of  the  holiness  of  the  law,  he never  dwells  on  it  with  the  sad  tenderness  for  the  vanishing system  which  marks  the  Epistle  to  the  Hebrews.  With  Paul the  break  with  the  law  was  sharp  and  complete.  The  law, as  a  champion  of  which  he  had  been  a  persecutor  of  Christ, is  thrown  into  sharp  relief  against  Christ  and  the  gospel. With  James  and  Peter  the  case  was  different.  It  would  not be  strange  if  some  writing  should  issue  from  their  circle  as ^the  last  voice  of  the  apostles  of  the  circumcision,''  content-   INTBODUCTION  TO  THE  EPISTLE  TO  THE  HEBREWS.      867  plating  with  affectionate  sympathy  that  through  which  they had  been  led  to  see  the  meaning  of  the  gospel,  and  finding  in it  *^a  welcome,  though  imperfect  source  of  consolation, instead  of  a  crushing  burden,  as  in  Paul's  case\"  (Westcott).  (5)  The  Personal  Authority  of  the  Writer  ib WHOLLY  IN  THE  BACKGROUND.  —  This  is  in  marked  con- trast with  the  epistles  of  Paul.  He  appears  to  place  himself in  the  second  generation  of  believers  to  whom  the  salvation preached  by  Chiist  had  been  certified  by  ear- witnesses ;  while Paul  refuses  to  be  regarded  as  a  pupil  of  the  apostles,  and claims  to  have  received  the  gospel  directly  from  the  Lord, and  to  have  been  certified  of  it  by  the  Spirit.  If  Paul  was  not  the  author,  who  was  ?  One  claim  is  about as  good  as  another,  and  no  claim  has  any  substantial  support. That  of  ApoUos  is  founded  solely  upon  Acts  xviii.  24  f.  ; 1  Cor.  i.  12  ;  ii.  4  ff.  The  most  that  can  be  deduced  from these  is  that  ApoUos  might  have  written  it.  There  is  no  evi- dence that  he  wrote  anything,  and  that  he  was  learned  and mighty  in  the  Scriptures  might  easily  have  been  true  of  others. Some  modern  critics  incline  to  Barnabas,  on  the  strength  of the  words  of  TertuUian  alluded  to  above,  but  this  is  as  unsat- isfactory as  the  rest.  As  regards  the  de$tination  of  the  epistle,  we  are  equally  in the  dark.  By  ecclesiastical  writers  from  the  earliest  time  it is  cited  under  the  title  to  the  Hcbrewn^  a  fact  which  is  entitled to  some  weight.  It  is  evidently  addressed  to  a  definite  circle of  readers,  and  that  circle  could  hardly  have  been  a  mixed church  of  Jews  and  Gentiles,  since  it  would  have  been  impos- sible in  that  case  for  the  letter  to  avoid  allusions  to  the  rela- tions between  the  two,  whereas  it  contains  no  allusion  to Gentile  Christians.  An  hypothesis  which  has  obtained  considerable  currency  in modem  criticism  is,  that  the  epistle  was  not  addressed  to Jewish  Christians  at  all,  but  to  Gentile  Christians,  as  a  warn- ing against  relapsing  into  heathenism,  by  showing  them  from the  Old  Testament  the  superiority  of  Christianity  to  Judaism.*  •  So  Pfleiderer,  yon  Soden,  Jtilicher,  Weizsttcker,  McGiffert   868      INTRODUCTION  TO  THE  EPISTLE  TO  THE  HEBREWS.  But  this  hypothesis  presents  formidable  difficulties.  This would  seem  to  be  a  roundabout  way  of  impressing  Gentiles with  the  superior  claims  of  Christianity.  It  would  appear  to have  been  the  more  natural  course  to  institute  a  direct  com- parison between  Christianity  and  paganism.  See  on  ch.  xiii. 7-15.  It  is  true  that  Gentile  Christians  were  familiar  with  the Old  Testament,  and  that  Paul's  epistles  to  Gentile  readers contain  frequent  allusions  to  it ;  and,  further,  that  Clement of  Rome,  in  his  epistle  to  the  Gentile  church  at  Corinth, makes  much  use  of  the  Epistle  to  the  Hebrews,  and  cites freely  from  the  Old  Testament.  But  to  illustrate  one's thoughts  and  arguments  by  occasional  references  to  the  Old Testament  is  a  very  different  thing  from  drawing  out  an elaborate  argument  on  the  basis  of  a  contrast  between  a  new and  an  older  order,  designed  to  show,  not  only  that  the new  is  superior  to  the  old,  but  that  the  new  is  enfolded  in  the old  and  developed  from  it.  To  this  there  is  no  parallel  in the  New  Testament  in  writings  addressed  to  Gentiles.  It would  have  been  superfluous  to  prove,  as  this  epistle  does» that  the  old  order  did  not  satisfy.  The  Gentiles  never  sup- posed that  it  did.  Moreover,  in  almost  every  case  of  Paul's  allusion  to  the Jewish  institutions,  the  reference  is  called  out  by  some  fea- ture of  the  Mosaic  economy  which  lay  directly  in  his  track and  compelled  him  to  deal  with  it.  Thus,  in  Romans,  he  is forced  to  discuss  the  doctrine  of  salvation  by  faith  with  ref- erence to  the  Jewish  doctrine  of  salvation  by  the  works  of the  law.  The  Galatians  had  been  tempted  by  Judaising  emis- saries to  return  to  the  law  of  circumcision.  In  Corinth,  Paul's authority  and  teaching  had  been  assailed  by  Jewish  aggres- sors. In  Philippians  we  have  no  allusion  to  the  law  until the  writer  comes  to  deal  with  *'  the  dogs,\"  \"  the  evil  workers,\" \"the  concision.\"  In  Colossians,  Jewish  ceremonialism  is  a distinct  factor  of  the  heresy  which  is  attacked ;  but  nowhere in  Paul's  epistles  is  there  a  didactic  development  of  a  thesis from  the  point  of  view  of  the  Old  Testament  economy  col- lectively.   INTBODUCTIOK  TO  THE  EPISTLE  TO  THE  HEBREWS.      869  The  same  remarks  will  apply  to  the  case  of  Clement  of Rome.  In  his  Epistle  to  the  Corinthians  there  are  about twenty  allusions  to  the  Epistle  to  the  Hebrews  or  quotations from  it.  Two  of  these  relate  to  the  majesty  of  God;  one  to Christ  as  high  priest ;  in  two  or  three  there  is  a  mere  imita- tion of  the  phraseology  of  Hebrews,  and  the  most  of  the  pas- sages are  practical  exhortations  to  the  cultivation  of  moral virtues,  enforced  by  allusions  to  the  Old  Testament  worthies. Any  of  these  passages  might  have  occurred  in  an  address  to either  Jews  or  Gentiles.  They  prove  nothing  as  to  the  point in  question.  If  we  did  not  know  from  other  sources  that Clement's  epistle  was  addressed  to  a  Gentile  church,  we could  not  infer  that  fact  from  these  quotations  and  allusions. Moreover,  Clement's  fondness  for  the  Old  Testament  and  the Epistle  to  the  Hebrews  is  easily  explained,  if,  as  there  is  very good  reason  for  believing,  Clement  himself  was  of  Jewish origin,  a  Hellenist.*  The  whole  argument  of  the  Epistle  to  the  Hebrews  is  tech- nieaUy  Jewish,  and  not  of  a  character  to  appeal  to  Gentile readers.  The  argiunent,  for  example,  for  the  superiority  of Christ  to  the  angels,  would  have  much  force  addressed  to Jews,  since  the  doctrine  of  the  communication  of  the  Mosaic revelation  through  the  ministration  of  angels  was  a  familiar tradition.  Between  the  writer  and  Jewish  readers  there  would be  no  question  as  to  the  angelic  mediation  of  the  Sinaitic legislation;  but  the  point  would  have  no  interest  and  no pertinency  for  the  average  Gentile.  The  Jew  would  readily apprehend  that  no  theophany  is  a  direct  manifestation  of  God to  the  physical  sense.  The  Gentile  mode  of  thought  would be  the  other  way.  The  Jew  would  understand  that  angels were  the  administrators  of  the  old  covenant,  and  would instinctively  catch  the  turn  of  the  whole  argument  to  the effect  that  with  the  exaltation  of  Christ  the  angelic  sway  of the  old  dispensation  ceased.  The  same  thing  might  be  said  of  the  doctrine  of  the  high- priesthood  of  Christ.    If  this  was  a  point  to  make  with  Gen-  •  See  Ligfatfoot'8  ClemefU  of  JSome,  VoL  L,  p.  600. VOL.  rr. — 24   870      INTBODUCTION  TO  THE  EPISTLE  TO  THE  HEBBEWB.  tiles,  it  is  strange  that  Paul  nowhere  alludes  to  it ;  and  what did  the  Gentile  care  about  Melchisedec  or  the  relation  of Christ^s  priesthood  to  his?  It  is  indeed  true  that,  in  the  practical  warnings  of  the epistle,  nothing  is  directly  said  about  apostasy  to  Judaism ; but  the  admonitions  are  enforced  by  distinctively  Jewish references,  as,  for  example,  the  warning  against  failure  to enter  into  God's  rest,  which  is  pointed  by  the  example  of  the Israelites  in  failing  to  enter  Canaan.  Would  a  writer  have said  to  a  Gentile  convert  that,  in  case  of  his  committing wilful  sin,  there  was  no  expiation  for  him?  But  he  might properly  say  to  a  Jewish  Christian,  who  was  tempted  to return  to  Judaism  :  ^^  If  you  abandon  Christ,  and  return  to Judaism,  you  have  no  more  sacrifice  for  sins.  Your  whole system  of  Levitical  sacrifices  is  abolished.  It  is  Christ  or nothing.\"  It  is  very  strongly  urged  that  the  warning  against  depart- ing from  the  living  God  (iii.  12)  might  very  properly  be given  to  Gentiles  as  against  a  relapse  into  heathenism,  while it  would  be  utterly  inappropriate  to  a  Jewish  Christian, because  the  living  God  is  common  to  both  Jews  and  Christ- ians ;  and  a  relapse  into  Judaism  could  not,  therefore,  be  a departure  from  the  living  God.  But  the  objection  overlooks the  intent  of  the  whole  epistle,  which  is  to  show  that  the living  God  of  the  Jewish  economy  has  revealed  himself  in the  Christian  ecojic/my,  thereby  superseding  the  former.  It is  the  God  of  the  Christian  dispensation  who  is  commended to  the  readers;  the  living  God  under  a  new  and  grander manifestation  of  life.  God  who  spake  by  the  prophets,  now speaks  by  his  Son,  the  efifulgence  of  his  glory  and  the  very image  of  his  substance.  To  go  back  to  the  old  economy  of types  and  shadows,  the  economy  of  partial  access  to  God, would  be  literally  to  depart  from  the  living  God.  It  would oe,  practically,  to  deny  him  as  a  living  God,  by  denying  all development  and  expansion  in  his  revelation  of  his  own  life, and  confining  that  revelation  to  the  narrow  limits  of  the Mosaic  system ;  in  other  words,  to  identify  the  living  God with  the  dead  system.    To  depart  from  Christ,  the  Life,  and   INTBODCJCTION  TO  THB  EPISTLE  TO  THE  HEBBEW8       871  to  seek  the  God  of  the  Old  Testament  revelation,  would  be to  fall  back  from  a  living  to  a  dead  God.  Again,  it  is  claimed  that  the  words  at  the  beginning  of Chapter  VI.  could  not  be  properly  addressed  to  Jewish  Christ- ians :  that  only  a  heathen  would  need  to  lay  such  a  founda- tion on  his  first  acceptance  of  Christ.  On  the  contrary,  all the  points  here  enumerated  would  have  had  to  be  expounded to  a  Jew  on  becoming  a  Christian.    See  notes  on  that  passage.  A  still  more  difficult  question  is  the  local  destination  of  tiie epistle.  By  those  who  supposed  it  to  be  the  work  of  Paul, attempts  were  made  to  place  this  destination  within  the  circle of  Paul's  recorded  missionary  labours ;  and  it  was  accordingly assigned  to  almost  every  place  visited  or  supposed  to  have  been visited  by  him,  —  Macedonia,  Corinth,  Antioch,  Spain,  etc.  A  plausible  hypothesis  assigned  its  destination  to  Jewish Christians  in  Alexandria.  This  was  based  on  the  fact  that the  Muratorian  Canon  (170-210),  while  omitting  Hebrews, notes  an  Epistle  to  the  Alexandrians  (^Ad  AUxandrinoB).  It was  argued  that,  since  the  Canon  contains  a  list  both  of  Paul's genuine  epistles  and  of  those  falsely  ascribed  to  him,  and since  Hebrews  is  not  mentioned,  the  Alexandrian  epistle  can mean  only  the  Epistle  to  the  Hebrews.  It  was  further  urged that  Alexandria  had,  next  to  Jerusalem,  the  largest  resident Jewish  population  in  the  world,  and  that  at  Leontopolis  in Egypt  was  another  temple,  with  the  arrangements  of  which the  notices  in  Hebrews  corresponded  more  nearly  than  with those  of  the  Jerusalem  temple.*  Moreover,  the  Alexandrian character  of  the  phraseology  of  the  epistle  was  supposed  to point  to  Alexandrian  readers.  But,  (a)  We  have  no  positive  history  of  the  church  in Egypt  in  apostolic  times,  (i)  Although  there  are  numerous notices  of  the  epistle  by  early  Alexandrian  writers,  there  is no  hint  of  its  having  been  addressed  to  their  own  church. {e)  In  the  Muratorian  Canon  the  Epistle  to  the  Alexandri- ans is  distinctly  stated  to  be  a  forgery  in  the  name  of  Paul.  •  This  temple  wm  founded  b.o.  lSO-146  by  Onias,  ooe  of  the  hig^-prieetiy fftmily.

((2)  It  cannot  be  shown  that  the  temple  at  Leontopolis  exer* cised  the  same  power  over  the  Alexandrian  Jews  as  the  temple at  Jerusalem  did  over  the  Palestinian  Jews.  Even  in  Egypt the  Jerusalem  temple  was  recognised  as  the  true  centre  of worship.  Moreover,  the  Christian  church  at  Alexandria  was a  mixed  church,  (e)  The  furniture  of  the  temple  at  Jeru- salem was  more  like  that  of  the  tabernacle  described  in Hebrews  than  that  of  the  Egyptian  temple.  A  widely-accepted  view  is  that  the  epistle  was  addressed to  Jewish  Christians  in  Palestine  and  Jerusalem.  Unmixed Jewish-Christian  churches  were  to  be  found  nowhere  else ;  and only  there  would  there  be  likely  to  exist  that  attachment  to  the old  worship  which  is  assumed  in  the  epistle,  while  it  treats only  incidentally  of  those  rites  to  which,  in  the  Dispersion, the  greatest  importance  was  naturally  assigned — ablutions, etc.  The  claim  that  the  epistle  was  addressed  to  Rome involves  a  mixed  church.  The  Roman  church  became  more Gentile  after  Paul's  residence  in  Rome.  On  the  assumption that  Jewish  Christians  were  addressed,  it  is  difficult  to  account for  the  Roman  destination,  unless  the  letter  was  intended  for a  distinct  circle  of  Jewish  Christians  in  Rome,  which  is  not impossible.  That  the  epistle  was  used  by  Clement  proves nothing.  The  phrase  cunrd^ovrcu  vfia^  oi  airh  r^  'IroX/o?  they from  Italy  scUtUe  you  might  seem  to  point  to  Rome  as  the  resi- dence of  the  parties  saluted ;  but  that  is  by  no  means  certain. The  meaning  of  the  expression  must  first  be  settled.  It  may mean  \"  those  in  Italy  send  greeting  from  Italy,\"  or,  \"  those who  are  from  Italy  (whose  home  is  there,  but  who  are  now with  me)  send  greeting  to  you  (whoever  may  be  addressed).\" The  latter  meaning  is  the  more  probable ;  but  on  that  suppo- sition the  words  afford  no  reliable  indication  of  the  residence of  those  addressed.  They  mean  merely  that  certain  Italians in  the  writer's  company  greet  the  writer's  correspondents, who  may  have  been  in  Palestine,  Asia,  or  Egypt.*  *  An  able  defence  of  the  Roman  hypothesiB  may  be  foond  in  R^ville,  Let Originei  de  V^pUeopat.

It appears,  at  first  sight,  unlikely  that  the  author  would  have written  in  Greek  to  Palestinian  Jewish  Christians,  whose language  was  Aramaic,  and  would  have  used  the  Septuagint exclusively  in  citations  from  the  Old  Testament.  Neverthe- less, Greek  was  understood  and  spoken  in  Palestine :  many Greek-speaking  Jews  resided  in  Jerusalem  (Acts  vi.  9),  and there  were  in  that  city  synagogues  of  the  Cyrenians  and  Alex- andrians, in  which  Greek  and  the  Septuagint  would  certainly be  used.  The  Hellenists  were  numerous  and  influential enough  to  carry  their  point  in  the  matter  of  ministration  to their  widows  (Acts  vi.  Iff.).  Finally,  it  is  not  impossible that  the  writer  of  the  epistle  was  not  sufficiently  acquainted with  Aramaic  to  write  effectively  in  that  language.  The  decisive  settlement  of  the  date  of  the  epistle  is  practic- ally given  up  by  critics.  The  most  that  can  be  done  is  to try  and  fix  approximately  the  limits  within  which  the  compo- sition was  possible.*  Only  one  point  is  definitely  fixed.  It must  have  been  written  before  Clement's  Epistle  to  the  Corin- thians (95).  If  addressed  to  Jewish  Christians,  or  indeed  to Gentiles,  it  is  highly  probable  that  it  was  written  before  the destruction  of  Jerusalem  (70),  since  it  is  most  unlikely  that the  writer  would  have  omitted  all  allusion  to  an  event  which furnished  such  a  striking  confirmation  of  his  teaching.  This probability  would  be  strengthened  if  it  could  be  proved  that the  Jewish  sacrifices  were  still  being  offered  at  the  time  when the  epistle  was  composed :  but  this  cannot  be  conclusively   ingenious  paper,  Probabilia  iiber  die  Adresse  und  den  Verfas$er  dee  Hehrder- briefs.  He  holds  that  the  epistle  was  addressed  to  a  Christian  coinmonity — a  house-church  in  Rome :  that  it  was  written  by  Aquila  and  Prisca,  princi- pally by  the  latter,  and  that,  so  far  from  being  addressed  especially  to  Hebrew Christians,  it  entirely  ignores  the  difference  between  Hebrews  and  Gentiles.  •The  results  of  even  this  attempt  vary  considerably.

Attempts  to  identify  the persecution  alluded  to  in  x.  2  are  the  merest  guess-work.  To refer  it  to  the  Neronian  persecution  (64)  is  to  assume  that  it was  addressed  to  Rome,  and  is,  therefore,  to  beg  the  question. The  reference  of  x.  86  and  xii.  8  to  the  persecution  of  Domitian (95),  is  utterly  without  foundation,  to  say  nothing  of  the fact  that  it  is  not  certain  that  those  two  passages  refer  to persecution  at  alL  Against  a  date  near  95  is  the  use  of  the epistle  by  Clement,  unless  the  Roman  address  can  be  proved. Otherwise,  some  time  would  be  required  for  it  to  obtain such  currency  and  recognition  as  would  account  for  Clement's familiarity  with  it.  Against  a  very  late  date  is  also  the  fact that  Timothy  Appears  as  an  active  evangelist,  which  could hardly  have  been  the  case  if  the  letter  was  written  as  late as  90.  Against  a  very  early  date  is  the  admitted  &ct  that  a second  generation  of  Christians  is  addressed  ;  and  that  the references  to  persecution  apparently  point  to  a  comparatively distant  time.  If  we  are  to  lay  stress  on  the  omission  of  all reference  to  the  destruction  of  Jerusalem,  as  I  think  we  must do,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  epistle  was  written  not  far  from  67.  There  is  no  reason  for  disputing  the  author's  acquaintance with  the  writings  of  Paul,  as  there  is  none  for  asserting  his dependence  upon  them.  There  are  lexical  resemblances  and resemblances  in  thought  and  phrasing,  but  nothing  to  show that  the  writer  of  Hebrews  drew  upon  Paul  to  any  consider* able  extent.  The  coincidences  with  (xalatians  which  are pointed  out  are  superficial,  and  may  be  fairly  traced  to  com- mon Jewish  ideas  with  which  both  writers  were  familiar.  As to  Romans,  Epbesians,  and  Corinthians,  the  resemblances  are, in  a  number  of  cases,  due  to  quotation  from  the  same  source  ; in  other  cases  they  occur  in  warnings  from  the  example  of  the Israelites  ;  in  others  again  there  is  a  coincidence  of  a  current phrase,  such  as  \"if  God  permit,\"  which  any  author  might  use. In  some  other  instances  cited  the  resemblance  is  too  remote to  be  significant.  As  to  the  influence  of  PhUo,  we  may  freely  admit  the  evi* deuces  of  the  writer's  Alexandrian  training,  and  the  possibilityi   nrrRODucTiON  to  thb  kpibtlb  to  thb  hebbkws.    375  perhaps  probability,  of  bis  acquaintance  with  Philo's  writ- ings.* The  epistle  does  exhibit  certain  points  of  resemblance to  Philo,  such  as  similar  forms  of  quotation,  similar  use  of  Old Testament  passages  and  narratives,  and  statements  like  those of  Philo,  such  as  those  respecting  the  sinlessness  of  the  Logos- Priest,  the  heavenly  home  of  the  patriarchs,  and  the  X/joi TOfAetk  the  dividing  word  (iv.  12) :  but  Philo's  meaning  differs radically  from  that  of  the  epistle.  Our  writer's  Christology has  no  affinity  with  that  of  Philo.  On  certain  leading  topics, such  as  the  two  ages  of  the  world,  the  mediation  of  the  law by  angels,  the  Sabbath-rest,  the  heavenly  sanctuary,  and  the heavenly  Jerusalem,  he  exhibits  more  affinity  with  Palestinian than  with  Alexandrian  thought.  The  most  tiiat  can  be  claimed is  that  the  Epistle  to  the  Hebrews  returns  echoes  of  Philo,  and exhibits  formal  and  limited  resemblances  to  him.f  *  Although  critics  are  not  nnuiimoos  <m  this  point.

The  writer  conceives the  history  of  the  world  in  its  relation  to  divine  revelation  as falling  into  two  great  periods;  The  first  he  calls  at  fiiiipou, atnai  these  days  (i.  2),  and  o  tccupcfi  6  ivtarriKm  the  present season  (ix.  9).

The  first  period  is  the period  of  the  old  covenant ;  the  second  that  of  the  new  cove- nant. The  second  period  does  not  begin  with  Christ's  first appearing.  His  appearing  and  public  ministry  are  at  the  end of  the  first  period  but  still  wi^in  it.  The  dividing-point between  the  two  periods  is  the  (nnniXua  rod  al&vo^  the  con^ summation  of  the  age^  mentioned  in  ix.  26.  This  does  not mean  the  same  thing  9A  atthe  last  of  these  days  (i.  2),  which is  the  end  of  the  first  period  denoted  by  these  days^  but  the conclusion  of  the  first  and  the  beginning  of  the  second  period, at  which  Christ  appeared  to  put  away  sin  by  the  saciifice  of himself.

The  phrase  iir  iaxdrov  r&v  ^fi£p&p  tovtodv  therefore  signifies, in  the  last  days  of  the  first  period,  when  Christ  was  speaking on  earth,  and  before  his  crucifixion,  which  marked  the  begin- ning of  the  second  period,  the  better  age  of  the  new  covenant.

He  belongs  to  another  category.  The  reve- lation was  a  son-revelation.    See  ch.  ii.  10-18.    Christ's  high   380  WORD  STUDIES  IN  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT.         [Cb.

Something  was  acquired  as the  result  of  his  incarnation  which  he  did  not  possess  before it,  and  could  not  have  possessed  without  it.  Equality  with God  was  his  birthright ;  but  out  of  his  human  life,  death, and  resurrection  came  a  type  of  sovereignty  which  could  per- tain to  him  only  through  his  triumph  over  human  sin  in  the flesh  (see  ver.  3),  through  his  identification  with  men  as  their brother.  Messianic  lordship  could  not  pertain  to  his  prein- camate  state :  it  is  a  matter  of  function,  not  of  inherent  power and  majesty.  He  was  e»$evtiaUy  Son  of  God ;  he  must  became Son  of  man.  By  whom  also  he  made  the  worlds  (&'  oi  ical  hroirjaev T0V9  al&va^).  AaA  commonly  expresses  secondary  agency; but,  in  some  instances,  it  is  used  of  God^s  direct  agency.  See 1  Cor.  i.  1 ;  2  Cor.  i.  1 ;  Gal.  iv.  7.  Christ  is  here  repre- sented as  a  mediate  agency  in  creation.  The  phrase  is,  clearly, coloured  by  the  Alexandrian  conception,  but  difters  from  it  in that  Christ  is  not  represented  as  a  mere  instrument,  a  passive tool,  but  rather  as  a  cooperating  agent.  \"  Every  being,  to reach  existence,  must  have  passed  through  the  thought  and will  of  the  Logos  \"  (Godet) ;  yet  \"  the  Son  can  do  nothing of  himself  but  what  he  seeth  the  Father  doing\"  (J.  v.  19). With  this  passage  Col.  i.  16  should  be  studied.  There  it  is said  that  all  things,  collectively  (tA  Trai^a),  were  created  in him  (iv  avT^^  and  through  him  (hC  airrov  as  here).

The  emphasis  is  on  made^  not  on  worlds :  on the  fact  of  creation^  not  on  what  was  created.  In  the  writer's thought  heirship  goes  with  creation.  Christ  is  heir  of  what he  made,  and  because  he  made  it.

[Oh.  L  accords  better  with  the  thought  of  the  passage ;  for  the  writer is  treating  of  the  preincamate  Son ;  and,  as  Alford  justly remarks,  ^^  the  Son  of  God  is,  in  this  his  essential  majesty,  the ea:preB9ion  and  the  sole  expression  of  the  divine  light ;  not,  as in  his  incarnation,  its  reflection.  **  The  consensus  of  the  Gre^ fathers  to  this  effect  is  of  great  weight.  The  meaning  then is,  that  the  Son  is  the  outraying  of  the  divine  glory,  exhibit- ing in  himself  the  glory  and  majesty  of  the  divine  Being. \"  God  lets  his  glory  issue  from  himself,  so  that  there  arises thereby  a  light4>e%ng  like  himself\"  (Weiss).

Arffa  is  attached  to  deity  :  iJLop^  is  identified  with  the  inmost being  of  deity.  AJfa  is  used  of  various  visible  displays  of divine  light  and  splendour,  as  Exod.  xxiv.  17  ;  Deut.  v.  24 ; Exod.  xl.  34  ;  Num.  xiv.  10  ;  xv.  19,  42 ;  Ezek.  x.  4 ;  xliii. 4,  5 ;  i.  28 ;  iii.  23 ;  Lev.  ix.  23,  etc.  We  come  nearer  to the  sense  of  the  word  in  this  passage  in  the  story  of  Moseses vision  of  the  divine  glory,  Exod.  xxxiii.  18-23 ;  xxxiv.  5,  7.

It  is  concerned,  not  only  with  sustaining  the  weight  of  the universe,  but  also  with  maintaining  its  coherence  and  carry- ing on  its  development.

In  the  thought  of  making  purification  of  sins  is already  foreshadowed  the  work  of  Christ  as  high  priest, which  plays  so  prominent  a  part  in  the  epistle.

The  detailed  development  of  the  argument  is  now  intro- duced. The  point  is  to  show  the  superiority  of  the  agent  of the  new  dispensation  to  the  agents  of  the  old — the  angels and  Moses.    Christ's  superiority  to  the  angels  is  first  discussed.  Being  made  so  much  better  than  the  angels  (roo-otny fcpeiTTODv  yevdfjLevo^  r&v  ayjiXtov),  The  informal  and  abrupt introduction  of  this  topic  goes  to  show  that  the  writer  was addressing  Jewish  Christians,  who  were  familiar  with  the prominent  part  ascribed  to  angels  in  the  O.  T.  economy, especially  in  the  giving  of  the  law.  See  on  Gal.  iii.  9.

It  Lb  not  denied  that  the  Son  was  essentially  and eternally  superior  to  the  angels;  but  his  glorification  was conditioned  upon  his  fulfilment  of  the  requirements  of  his human  state,  and  it  is  this  that  is  emphasised.  After  having passed  through  the  experience  described  in  Philip,  ii.  6-8,  he sat  down  on  the  right  hand  of  the  divine  majesty  as  messianic sovereign,  and  so  became  or  proved  to  be  what  in  reality  he  was from  eternity,  superior  to  the  angels.

He  became  superior  to  the  angels,  resuming his  preincamate  dignity,  as  he  had  been,  for  a  brief  period, less  or  lower  than  the  angels  (ch.  ii.  7).

The  Son's  name  differs  from  that  of  the  angels,  and  is  more different  for  good.  Than  they  (jrap*  avroi^).  Lit.  bends  or  in  eomparimm  with them.

The  writer  proceeds  to  establish  the  superiority  of  the Son  to  the  angels  by  O.  T.  testimony.  It  is  a  mode  of  argu* ment  which  does  not  appeal  strongly  to  us.  Dr.  Bruce suggests  that  there  are  evidences  that  the  writer  himself developed  it  perfunctorily  and  without  much  interest  in  it. The  seven  following  quotations  are  intended  to  show  the  sur- passing excellence  of  Christ's  name  as  set  forth  in  Scripture. The  quotations  present  difficulty  in  that  they  appear,  in  great part,  to  be  used  in  a  sense  and  with  an  application  different from  those  which  they  originally  had.  All  that  can  be  said is,  that  the  writer  takes  these  passages  as  messianic,  and applies  them  accordingly ;  and  that  we  must  distinguish between  the  doctrine  and  the  method  of  argumentation  pecul- iar to  the  time  and  people.

The  king  is  called Son  of  Jdhveht  and  is  said  to  be  ^^  begotten  \"  on  the  day  on which  he  is  publicly  recognised  as  king.

Recognised  thee  publicly as  sovereign  ;  established  thee  in  an  official  sonship-relation. This  official  installation  appears  to  have  its  N.  T.  counterpart in  the  resurrection  of  Christ.  In  Acts  xiii.  38,  this  is  dis- tinctly asserted  ;  and  in  Rom.  i.  4,  Paul  says  that  Christ  was \"powerfully  declared\"  to  be  the  Son  of  God  by  the  resurrec- tion from  tie  dead.

Nathan  tells him  that  this  shall  be  done  by  Solomon,  whom  Jahveh  will adopt  as  his  son.  In  2  Cor.  vi.  18,  Paul  applies  the  passage to  followers  of  the  Messiah,  understanding  the  original  as referring  to  all  the  spiritual  children  of  David.  *  Opinions  differ  as  to  the  sense  in  which  this  expression  is  applied  to  the Messiah.

It  will  be  observed  that  in  this verse,  and  in  vv.  7,  8,  God  is  conceived  as  spoken  of  rather than  as  speaking;  the  subject  of  XSyei  saith  being  indefinite. This  mode  of  introducing  citations  differs  from  that  of  Paul. The  author's  conception  of  the  inspiration  of  Scripture  leads him  to  regard  all  utterances  of  Scripture,  without  regard  to their  connection,  as  distinct  utterances  of  God,  or  the  Holy Spirit,  or  the  Son  of  God ;  whereas,  by  Paul,  they  are  des- ignated either  as  utterances  of  Scripture  in  general,  or  of individual  writers.  Very  common  in  this  Epistle  are  the expressions,  \"God  saith^  said,  spake,  testifieth,^^  or  the  like.

When  he wishes  he  makes  them  sitting:  sometimes  he  makes  them standing :  sometimes  he  makes  them  winds,  sometimes  fire.\" ^^  The  subjection  of  the  angels  is  such  that  they  must  subnodt even  to  be  changed  into  elements.\"  ^^The  angel  said  to Manoah,  ^  I  know  not  to  the  image  of  what  I  am  made ;  for God  changes  us  each  hour:  wherefore  then  dost  thou  ask my  name?  Sometimes  he  makes  us  fire,  sometimes  wind.* \" The  emphasis,  therefore,  is  not  on  the  fact  that  the  angels are  merely  servants,  but  that  their  being  is  such  that  they are  only  what  God  makes  them  according  to  the  needs  of their  service,  and  are,  therefore,  changeable,  in  contrast  with the  Son,  who  is  ruler  and  unchangeable.  There  would  be no  pertinency  in  the  statement  that  God  makes  his  angels spirits,  which  goes  without  saying.  The  Rabbis  conceived the  angels  as  perishable.

The great  salvation  means  lordship  of  the  world  to  be.  This  pur- pose is  carried  out  in  Christ,  who,  in  becoming  man,  became temporarily  subject  to  the  earthly  dispensation  of  which angels  were  the  administrators.  This  was  in  order  that  he might  acquire  universal  lordship  as  man.

This  thought  is  developed by  means  of  Ps.  viii.  Having  set  Christ  above  the  angels, the  writer  must  reconcile  that  claim  with  the  historical  fact of  Christ's  humiliation  in  his  incarnate  state.  The  Psalm presents  a  paradox  in  the  antithesis  of  lower  than  the  angels and  all  things  under  his  feet.  From  the  Psalm  is  drawn  the statement  of  a  temporary  subordination  of  Christ  to  angels, followed  by  his  permanent  exaltation  over  them.  Hath  —  put  in  subjection  (Jnr^ra^af).

These  elements  are elemented  forces  or  spirits  j  as  appears  from  a  correct  interpre- tation of  Col.  ii.  8,  20.*  The  subjection  to  elemental  spirits is  only  another  form  of  subjection  to  the  angels  of  the  law, and  our  author  uses  this  doctrine  to  show  the  mutable  nature of  angels  in  contrast  with  the  immutable  perfection  of  the Son  (see  ch.  i.  7,  8).  This  accords  with  the  Epistle  to  the Colossians  which  deals  with  the  heresy  of  angel-worship,  and in  which  the  worship  of  angels  is  represented  as  connected with  the  service  of  elemental  or  cosmic  forces.  Very  strik- ing is  Col.  ii.  15.  When  the  bond  of  the  law  was  rendered void  in  Christ's  crucifixion,  that  ministry  of  angels  which waited  on  the  giving  of  the  law  was  set  aside  by  God  (air€K- SwrafA€iHi^  having  stripped  off^^  revealing  Christ  as  the  head of  every  principality  and  power.

With  a  view  to  the  recoil  of  Jewish  readers  from  the  thought of  a  suffering  Messiah  (1  Cor.  i.  23),  the  writer  will  show that  Jesus'  suffering  and  death  were  according  to  the  divine fitness  of  thing^.  10.  It  became  (hrpeirof) .  Not  logical  necesiity  (&*,  ver.  1), nor  obligation  growing  out  of  eircu7n$tances  (cS^iXcv,  ver.  17), but  an  inner  fitne$s  in  God's  dealing.  Dr.  Robertson  Smith observes  :  ^*  The  whole  course  of  nature  and  grace  must  find its  explanation  in  God ;  and  not  merely  in  an  abstract  divine arbitrium^  but  in  that  which  befits  the  divine  nature.\"  For  whom  —  by  whom  (&'  Sv — &*  oS).

The  pas- sage occurs  in  an  invective  against  the  people's  folly  in  trust- ing to  any  help  but  God*s  during  the  Syro-Israelitish  war under  Ahaz.  The  prophet  is  commanded  to  denounce  those who  trusted  to  soothsayers  and  not  to  God,  and  to  bind  and seal  God's  testimony  to  the  righteous  party  who  maintained their  confidence  in  him — a  party  comprising  the  disciples  of Isaiah,  and  in  whom  lies  the  prophet's  hope  for  the  future  of Israel.  Isaiah  declares  his  own  faith  in  God,  and  announces that  he  and  his  children  have  been  appointed  as  living  sym- bols of  the  divine  will,  so  that  there  is  no  need  of  applying  to necromancers.  The  names  of  the  children  are  Shear-jashub a  remnant  shall  return^  and  Maher-shalal-hash-baz  haste-^poUr hurry-prey.  These  names  will  teach  Israel  that  Assyria  will spoil  Damascus  and  Samaria ;  and  that,  in  the  midst  of  foreign invasion,  God  will  still  be  with  Judah,  and  will  make  a  nation of  the  remnant  which  the  war  shall  leave.  The  prophet  and his  children  are  thus  omens  of  the  nation's  fortunes.  The children  were  babes  at  this  time,  and  ^Hhe  only  unity  which existed  among  them  was  that  which  exists  between  every father  and  his  children,  and  that  which  resulted  from  their belonging  to  the  same  prophetic  household  and  all  bearing symbolic  names  (without  knowledge  of  the  fact  on  the  part of  the  children).\"  •  Our  writer  ignores  the  historical  sense of  the  words,  takes,  a  part  of  a  sentence  and  puts  a  messianic meaning  into  it,  inferring  from  it  the  oneness  of  Jesus  and his  people,  and  the  necessity  of  his  assuming  their  nature  in order  to  be  one  with  them.

Not  power  over  death,  but  sovereignty  or  domin- ion  of  deaths  a  sovereignty  of  which  death  is  the  realm. Comp.  Rom.  v.  21,  ^^Sin  reigned  in  death.\"  That  it  the  devil.  An  explanation  has  been  sought  in the  Jewish  doctrine  which  identified  Satan  with  Sammael,   Ch.  IL]  the  EPISTLB  to  the  HEBSXW8.  406  the  angel  of  death,  who,  according  to  the  later  Jews,  tempted Eve.  This  is  fanciful,  and  has  no  value,  to  say  nothing  of the  fact  that  Michael  and  not  Sammael  was  the  angel  of  death to  the  Israelites.  The  O.  T.  nowhere  identifies  Satan  with the  serpent  in  Eden.  That  identification  is  found  in  Wiad. ii.  24,  and  is  adopted  Apoc.  xii.  9.  The  devil  has  not  power to  inflict  death,  nor  is  death,  as  such,  done  away  by  the bringing  of  the  devil  to  nought.  The  sense  of  the  passage is  that  Satan's  dominion  in  the  region  of  death  is  seen  in  the existence  and  power  of  the  fear  of  death  as  the  penalty  of  sin (comp.  thnyughfear  of  deaths  ver.  15).  The  fear  of  death  as implying  rejection  by  God  is  distinctly  to  be  seen  in  O.  T. It  appears  in  the  utterances  of  many  of  the  Psalmists.  There is  a  consciousness  of  the  lack  of  a  pledge  that  God  will  not, in  any  special  case,  rise  up  against  one.  Along  with  this goes  the  conception  of  Satan  as  the  accuser,  see  Zech.  iii. This  idea  may  possibly  give  colouring  to  this  passage.  Even before  death  the  accuser  exercises  sway,  and  keeps  God's people  in  bondage  so  long  as  they  are  oppressed  with  the fear  of  death  as  indicating  the  lack  of  full  acceptance  with God.  How  strongly  this  argument  would  appeal  to  Hebrew readers  of  the  Epistle  is  clear  from  rabbinical  theology,  which often  speaks  of  the  fear  of  death,  and  the  accuser  as  a  con- stant companion  of  man's  life.  Jesus  assumes  the  mortal flesh  and  blood  which  are  subject  to  this  bondage.  He proves  himself  to  be  both  exempt  from  the  fear  of  death  and victorious  over  the  accuser.  He  never  lost  his  sense  of  one- ness with  God,  so  that  death  was  not  to  him  a  sign  of  separ- ation from  God's  grace.  It  was  a  step  in  his  appointed career ;  a  means  (St^  rot)  Oavdrov)  whereby  he  accomplished his  vocation  as  Saviour.  His  human  brethren  share  his exemption  from  the  bondage  of  the  fear  of  death,  and  of  the accusing  power  of  Satan.  ^^  He  that  believeth  on  the  Son hath  eternal  life.'*  \"Whether  we  live  or  die  we  are  the Lord's.\"*  •  I  dedre  to  acknowledge  my  obligation  in  the  notes  on  this  pMsage  to the  yery  suggestive  aeries  of  articlea  by  Dr.  W.

See  Ps.  cv.  6 ;  Isa.  xli.  8,  and  comp.  Gal.  iii.  29. The  O.  T.  name  is  selected  because  the  writer  is  addressing Jews.  The  entire  statement  in  w.  16, 17  is  not  a  mere  repe- tition of  vv.  14, 15.  It  carries  out  the  line  of  thought  and adds  to  it,  while  at  the  same  time  it  presents  a  parallel  argu- ment to  that  in  vv.  14,  15.  Thus :  w.  14, 15,  Christ  took part  of  flesh  and  blood  that  he  might  deliver  the  children  of God  from  the  fear  of  death  and  the  accusations  of  Satan : vv.  16,  17,  Christ  takes  hold  of  the  seed  of  Abraham,  the church  of  God,  and  is  made  like  unto  his  brethren,  tempted as  they  are,  in  order  that  he  may  be  a  faithful  high  priest, making  reconciliation  for  sin,  thus  doing  away  with  the  fear   Ch.

Christ  gives  that  peculiar help  the  necessity  of  which  Was  exhibited  in  the  O.  T.  econ- omy under  which  the  original  seed  of  Abraham  lived.  The fear  of  death,  arising  from  the  consciousness  of  sin,  could  be relieved  only  by  the  intervention  of  the  priest  who  stood between  God  and  the  sinner,  and  made  reconciliation  for  sin. Jesus  steps  into  the  place  of  the  high  priest,  and  perfectly fulfils  the  priestly  office.  By  his  actual  participation  in  the sorrows  and  temptations  of  humanity  he  is  fitted  to  be  a  true sympathiser  with  human  infirmity  and  temptation  (ch.  v.  2), a  merciful  and  faithful  high  priest,  making  reconciliation for  sin,  and  thus  abolishing  the  fear  of  death.  17.

There  was a  complete  and  real  likeness  to  humanity,  a  likeness  which was  closest  just  where  the  traces  of  the  curse  of  sin  were most  apparent  —  in  poverty,  temptation,  and  violent  and unmerited  death.

The  kejmote  of  the Epistle,  the  high-priesthood  of  Christ,  which  is  intimated  in ch.  i.  8,  is  here  for  the  first  time  distinctly  struck.  Having shown  that  Christ  delivers  from  the  fear  of  death  by  nullify- ing the  accusing  power  of  sin,  he  now  shows  that  he  does this  in  his  capacity  of  high  priest,  for  which  office  it  was   408  WORD  nUDlES  IN  THE  NKW  TnTAXBNT.        Gk.  IL  necessary  that  he  should  be  made  like  unto  his  human  breth- ren. In  the  O.  T.  economy,  the  fear  of  death  was  especially connected  with  the  approach  to  Gt>d  of  an  impure  worshipper (see  Num.  xviii.  3,  5).  This  fear  was  mitigated  or  removed by  the  intervention  of  the  Levitical  priest,  since  it  was  the special  charge  of  the  priest  so  to  discharge  the  service  of  the tabernacle  that  there  might  be  no  outbreak  of  divine  wrath on  the  children  of  Israel  (Num.  xviii.  5).  TAnfrai  might $haw  himself  to  be^  or  prove  to  be.  The  idea  of  compassion as  an  attribute  of  priests  is  not  found  in  the  O.  T.  On  the contrary,  the  fault  of  the  priests  was  their  frequent  lack  of sympathy  with  the  people  (see  Hoe.  iv.  4-9).  In  the  later Jewish  history,  and  in  N.  T.  times,  the  priestly  aristocracy of  the  Sadducees  was  notoriously  unfeeling  and  cruel.  The idea  of  a  compassionate  and  faithful  high  priest  would  appeal powerfully  to  Jewish  readers,  who  knew  the  deficiency  of  the Aaronic  priesthood  in  that  particular.  Hurrh^  faithfilt  as  an attribute  of  a  priest,  appears  in  1  Sam.  ii.  85.  The  idea  there is  fdelity.  He  will  do  all  that  is  in  God's  mind.  Comp. Heb.  iii.  2.

Ch.  m.]  THB  EPISTLE  TO  THE  HEBREWS.  411  The  subject  of  the  high-priesthood  of  Christ,  introduced in  this  verse,  is  not  carried  out  in  detail  by  showing  the superiority  of  Jesus  to  earthly  high  priests.  This  is  reserved for  chs.  v.-vii.  Instead,  the  writer  proceeds  to  show  that Christ  is  superior  to  Moses,  as  he  has  already  shown  his superiority  to  angels.  He  will  thus  have  shown  Christ's superiority  to  both  the  agencies  by  which  the  old  covenant was  mediated.  The  subject  is  a  delicate  one  to  treat  for Jewish  readers  to  whom  Moses  was  the  object  of  the  deepest veneration ;  but  the  treatment  displays  tact  by  placing  Moses in  the  foreground  beside  Christ  as  an  example  of  fidelity  to his  commission.  Justice  is  thus  done  to  the  familiar  histor- ical record,  and  to  Ood*s  own  testimony,  Num.  xii.  7.  The general  sense  of  the  comparison  is  that  Moses  was  as  faithful as  any  »ervant  in  a  house  can  be,  while  Christ  was  not  a  serv- ant in  the  house,  but  a  son,  and  displayed  his  fidelity  in  that capacity.  8.

The argument  is  based  on  the  general  principle  that  the  founder of  a  house  is  entitled  to  more  honour  than  the  house  and  its individual  servants.  There  is  an  apparent  confusion  in  the working  out,  since  both  God  and  Christ  appear  as  builders^ and  Moses  figures  both  as  the  house  and  as  a  servant  in  the house.  The  point  of  the  whole,  however,  is  that  Moses  was Apart  of  the  O.  T.  system  —  a  servant  in  the  house;  while Christ,  as  one  with  Ood  who  established  all  things,  was  the founder  and  establisher  of  both  the  Old  and  the  New  Testa- ment economies.  4.

The  application  of  buUt  or  establUhed  to  Christ (ver.  3)  is  guarded  against  possible  misapprehension.  Christ is  the  establisher,  but  not  by  any  independent  will  or  agency. As  the  Son  he  is  he  that  built^  but  it  is  as  one  with  Ood  who built  all  thingi.

An  ethical  character  attaches  to  it, as  to  the  kindred  verb  Oepaweveiv :  service  of  an  affectionate, hearty  character,  performed  with  care  and  fidelity.  Hence the  relation  of  the  Oepdirtov  is  of  a  nobler  and  freer  character than  that  of  the  &)dXo9  or  bondservant.  The  verb  is  used  of a  physician's  tendance  of  the  sick.  Xenophon  (JHem.  iv.  8, 9) uses  it  of  the  gods  talcing  care  of  men,  and,  on  the  other hand,  of  men's  worshipping  the  gods  (ii,  1.  28).  See  Eurip. Iph.

But  this  would  be  entirely  irrelevant.  The  writer  is  not  trying  to  show  that Christ  was  greater  than  Moees  because  he  was  God,  bat  because  of  his  fidel- ity as  a  son  instead  of  as  a  servant.

Moses'  faithful  service  in  6od*s  house  was for  a  tettimony^  etc.  The  thingi  which  were  to  he  spoken  are the  revelations  afterward  to  he  given  in  Christ.  Others,  how- ever, explain  of  the  things  which  Moses  himself  was  after- ward  to  speak  to  the  people  by  God*s  command,  referring to  Num.  xii.  8.  According  to  this  explanation,  the  fidelity hitherto  exhibited  by  Moses  ought  to  command  respect  for all  that  he  might  say  in  future.  But  (1)  in  the  present connection  that  thought  is  insignificant.  (2)  It  would  be an  exaggeration  to  speak  of  Moses's  fidelity  to  God  through- out his  whole  official  career  as  a  witness  of  the  things  which he  was  to  speak  to  the  people  by  God's  command.  (8)  The future  participle  requires  a  reference  to  a  time  subsequent  to Moses's  ministry.  The  meaning  is  that  Moses,  in  his  entire ministry,  was  but  a  testimony  to  what  was  to  be  spoken  in the  future  by  another  and  a  greater  than  he.  Comp.

Textually, there  is  some  doubt  about  these  words.  Westcott  and  Hort bracket  them.  Tischendorf  retains,  and  Weiss  rejects  them.

We  are  God's  house  if  we steadfastly  hold  fast  our  Christian  hope,  and  do  not  lose  our faith  as  Israel  did  in  the  wilderness.

Christian  salvation,  having  been  presented  as  lordship  over the  world  to  come,  and  as  deliverance  from  the  fear  of  death, is  now  to  be  presented  as  participation  in  the  rest  of  God.  The purpose  of  vv.  1-11  is  to  confirm  the  hope  of  that  rest,  and to  warn  against  forfeiting  it.  There  is  a  possibility  of  your forfeiting  it.  The  rest  of  God  was  proclaimed  to  your  fore- fathers, but  they  did  not  enter  into  it  because  of  their  unbe- lief. It  has  been  proclaimed  to  you.  You  may  fail  as  did they,  and  for  the  same  reason.  1.  Being  left  (/caraXftTro/i^^).  Still  remaining :  not  being neglected.  It  is  not  a  reason  for  fearing  that  is  given,  but  a circumstance  connected  with  the  tiling  to  be  avoided.  As there  is  now  left  a  promise,  let  us  fear.  Being  left  announces the  thought  which  is  afterward  emphasised,  and  on  which the  whole  treatment  of  the  subject  turns — that  God's  original promise  of  rest  remains  unchanged^  and  still  holds  good.  Such being  the  ciise,  he  wJio  doubts  the  promise  itself,  or  thinks that  it  is  too  late  for  him  to  enjoy  its  fulfilment,  runs  a  risk.  Should  seem  to  come  short  (hoKy  varefyrjKevai).

For  one  to  think that  he  has  come  too  late  to  inherit  the  promise  is  to  disbe- lieve an  immutable  promise  of  God.

V.  is  unfortunate,  since  it conveys  the  technical  and  conventional  idea  of  preaching  the gospeU  which  is  entirely  out  of  place  here.  The  reference  is to  the  special  announcement  of  the  rest  of  God ;  the  glad tidings  that  God  has  provided  a  rest  for  his  people.  This announcement  was  made  to  the  fathers,  and  signified  to  them the  promise  of  the  rest  in  Canaan.  It  has  been  proclaimed to  us,  and  to  us  is  the  announcement  of  the  heavenly  rest.

More- over, in  ch.  iii.  16,  the  writer  has  declared  that  there  were practically  no  believing  hearers.  He  says  that  although  the good  tidings  were  announced  to  them,  they  did  not  profit them.  The  word  did  not  profit  them  because  it  (the  word) was  not  assimilated  by  faith  in  those  that  heard.  They  did not  make  the  promise  of  rest  their  own.  Their  history  was marked  by  continual  renewals  and  rejections  of  the  promise.  8.    For  we  which    have    believed  do  enter    into   rest  (elaepx'if^ffo'  y^p  w  t^p  tcardirauaip  oi  irurmuravTei).

We  enter  m  aeeordanee  with the  saying  which  follows.  As  I  have  sworn — if  they  shall  enter.  The  statement is  somewhat  obscure.  The  meaning  is,  we  (who  believed) enter  into  rest  in  accordance  with  God's  declaration  that  thejf (who  did  not  believe)  should  not  enter.  The  point  is  faiA as  the  condition  of  entering  into  the  rest.  Although  the  works  were  finished  (jcaCroi,  r&v  Spy^p yevrjOdmoDv).

He  passes  over the  fact  that  the  rest  had  not  been  entered  into  at  any  later period  of  IsraeFs  history.  Man's  portion  in  the  divine  rest inaugurated  at  creation  has  never  been  really  appropriated  : but  it  still  remaineth.

The  Sabbath  rest  points  back  to God's  original  rest,  and  marks  the  ideal  rest — the  rest  of  per- fect adjustment  of  all  things  to  God,  such  as  ensued  upon the  completion  of  his  creative  work,  when  he  pronounced  all things  good.  This  falls  in  with  the  ground-thought  of  the Epistle,  the  restoration  of  all  things  to  God's  archetype.  The sin  and  unbelief  of  Israel  were  incompatible  with  that  rest. It  must  remain  unappropriated  until  harmony  with  Gt>d  is restored.  The  Sabbath-rest  is  the  consummation  of  the  new creation  in  Christ,  through  whose  priestly  mediation  recon- ciliation with  God  will  come  to  pass.

The  statement is  a  general  proposition :  any  one  who  has  entered  into  God's rest  has  ceased  from  his  works.  As  God  did  from  his  (Jkairep  hirh  r&v  lUmv  o  Beii).

Rather,  works  pecvdiarly  his  own,  thus  hint- ing at  the  perfect  nature  of  the  original  works  of  creation  as corresponding  with  God's  nature  and  bearing  his  impress. The  blessing  of  the  Sabbath-rest  is  thus  put  as  a  cessation from  labours.  The  basis  of  the  conception  is  Jewish,  the rest  of  the  Sabbath  being  conceived  as  mere  abstinence  from labour,  and  not  according  to  Christ's  conception  of  the  Sab- bath, as  a  season  of  refreshment  and  beneficent  activity, Mk.  ii.  27 ;  J.  v.  17.

The  form  of  expression  is  poetical,  and  signifies  that  the word  penetrates  to  the  inmost  recesses  of  our  spiritual  being as  a  sword  cuts  through  the  joints  and  marrow  of  the  body.

The  idea  at  the  root  seems to  be  the  bending  back  of  the  neck,  and  the  last  explanation, better  than  any  other,  suits  the  previous  figure  of  the  sword. The  custom  of  drawing  back  the  victim's  neck  for  sacrifice is  familiar  to  all  classical  students.  See  Hom.  11.  i.  459; ii.  422 ;  Pindar,  01.  xiii.  114.

The  fall  name  of  the  city  was  Alexandria  Troas. It  was  founded  by  Antigonus,  one  of  the  successors  of  Alex- ander the  Great,  and  originally  called  by  him  Antigonia  Troas. It  was  finished  by  Lysitnachus,  another  of  Alexander's  generals, and  called  by  him  Alexandria  Troas.  It  stood  upon  the  sea- shore, about  four  miles  from  ancient  Troy,  and  six  miles  south of  the  entrance  to  the  Hellespont.  It  was,  for  many  centuries, the  key  of  the  traffic  between  Europe  and  Asia,  having  an  ar- tificial port  consisting  of  two  basins.  Its  ruins,  with  their immense  arches  and  great  columns  of  granite,  indicate  a  city of  much  splendor.  The  Bomans  had  a  peculiar  interest  in  it, connected  with  the  tradition  of  their  own  origin  from  Troy ; and  the  jtis  Italicum  was  accorded  it  by  Augustus,  by  which its  territory  enjoyed  the  same  immunity  from  taxation  which attached  to  land  in  Italy.

It  is  derived  from ^plafi^tK  a  hymn  to  Baechua,  sung  in  festal  processions,  and was  used  to  denote  the  Roman  \"triumph,\"  celebrated  by  vic- torious generals  on  their  return  frem  their  campaigns.  Tlie general  entered  the  city  in  a  chariot,  preceded  by  the  captives i;nd  spoils  taken  in  war,  and  followed  by  his  troops,  and  pro- ceeded in  state  along  the  sacred  way  to  the  Capitol,  where  he offered  saci'iGces  in  the  temple  of  Jupiter.  He  was  accom- panied in  his  chariot  by  his  young  children,  and  sometimes  by confidential  friends,  while  behind  hiin  stood  a  slave,  holding over  his  head  a  jewelled  crown.  The  body  of  the  infantry brought  up  the  rear,  their  spears  adorned  with  laurel.  They shouted  \"triumph!\"  and  sang  hymns  in  praise  of  the  gods  or of  their  leader.  Paul  describee  himself  and  the  other  subjects of  Christ's  grace  under  the  figure  of  this  triumphal  pomp,  in wliich  they  are  led  as  trophies  of  the  Eedeemer's  conquest.'-   ■  vt:>p   Sea,  further,  on  Col.  li   ir>,     O.

For  a  similar usage  see  on  ch.  i.  22.  The  idea  of  the  Roman  triumph  is  still preserved  in  this  figure.  On  these  occasions  the  temples  were all  thrown  open,  garlands  of  flowers  decorated  every  shrine  and image,  and  incense  smoked  on  every  altar,  so  that  the  victor was  greeted  with  a  cloud  of  perfume.

These  not  only  sold  their  wares  in  the market,  but  had  KairrfXela  wineshops  all  over  the  town,  where it  was  not  thonght  respectable  to  take  refreshments.  The whole  trade  was  greatly  despised.  In  Thebes  no  one  who  had sold  in  the  market  within  the  last  ten  years  was  allowed  to take  part  in  the  government.  So  Plato,  speaking  of  the  evils of  luxury  and  poverty :  \"  What  remedy  can  a  city  of  sense  find against  this  disease  ?  In  the  first  place,  they  must  have  as  few retail  traders  as  possible\"  (^^Laws,\"  919.  The  whole  passage is  well  worth  reading).  The  moral  application  of  the  term was  familiar  in  classical  Greek.  Lncian  says :  '^  The  philoso- phers deal  out  their  instructions  like  hucksters.\"  Plato :  ^^  Those who  carry  about  the  wares  of  knowledge,  and  make  the  round of  the  cities,  and  sell  or  retail  them  to  any  customer  who  is  in want  of  them,  praise  them  all  alike  ;  though  I  should  not  won- der if  many  of  them  were  really  ignorant  of  their  effect  upon the  soul ;  and  their  customers  equally  ignorant,  unless  he  who buys  of  them  happens  to  be  a  physician  of  the  soul \"  (\"  Pro- tagoras,\" 313).  Paul  here  uses  the  term  of  those  who  trade  in the  word  of  Qod,  adulterating  it  for  the  purpose  of  gain  or popularity.  Compare  1  Tim.  vi.  5,  Rev.  In  the  \"Teaching of  the  Twelve  Apostles\"  occurs  the  word  ypMrrifiiropo^  a Christ-monger  (ch.  xiL,  5).   CHAPTER  IIL  1.  Do  we  begin  again.  Rev.,  a/re  we  beginning.

The  figure  which  follows  is  freely  and somewhat  loosely  worked  out,  and  presents  different  faces  in rapid  succession.  The  ligure  itself  ia  that  of  a  cominendaUvj letter  representing  the  Corinthian  Church :  \"  Ye  are  our  letter.\" This  figure  is  carried  out  in  three  directions:  1,  As  related  to iAe  apmtlea'  own  consciousness.  The  Corinthian  Church  is  a letter  written  on  the  apostles'  hearts.  Their  own  conscious- nesB  testifies  that  that  Church  is  the  fruit  of  a  divinely  accred- ited, honest,  and  faithful  ministry.  3.  As  related  to  the  Cor- inthians themsel/oes.  The  Ciiurch  needs  no  letter  to  commend the  apostles  to  it.  It  is  its  own  commendation.  As  the  visible fruit  of  the  apostles'  iiiiniatry  they  are  a  commendatory  letter to  themselves.  If  the  question  arises  among  them,  \"Were Paul  and  his  colleagues  duly  commissioned  t  \" — the  answer  ie, \"  We  ourselves  are  the  proof  of  it.\"  3.  As  rdated  to  otlters outside  of  the  Corinthian,  Church.  The  answer  to  the  charge that  the  Corinthians  have  been  taught  by  irregular  and  uncom- missioned teachers  is  the  same :  \"  Behold  the  frnit  of  their labors  in  us.      We  are  their  commission.\"  At  this  point  the  figure  again  shifts ;  the  letter  being  now conceived  as  written  on  the  Corinthians'  hearts,  instead  of  on the  hearts  of  the  apostles:  written  by  Christ  through  the apostlea*  ministry.  This  suggests  the  comparison  with  the  law written  on  tables  of  stone,  which  are  used  as  a  figure  of  the ^^Mt,  fleshy  tables,  thus  introducing  two  incongruities,  namely, an  epistle  written  on  stone,  and  writing  imth  ink  on  stone  tahl^.

That  which  hath  been  made  gloH- 0(is  is  the  ministry  of  death  and  condemnation  (vv.  7,  9),  the ministry  of  Moses  in  the  giving  of  the  law,  which  ministry  was temporarily  glorified  in  the  shining  of  Moses'  face.

The  figure  which  pervades  the  whole  passage  (7-11) is  that  of  a  glorified fa/ie.  The  ministration  of  the  law,  impers- onated in  Moses,  is  described  as  having  its  face  glorified.  It is  to  this  that  in  this  respect  refers.  Paul  says  that  the  minis- try of  the  law,  which  was  temporarily  glorified  in  the  face  of Moses,  is  no  longer  glorified  in  this  respect;  that  is,  it  no  longer appears  with  glorified  face,  because  of  the  glory  that  excellethj the  glory  of  Christ  ministering  the  Oospel,  before  which  it  fades away  and  is  as  if  it  had  not  been.  This  accords  with  ch.  iv., whore  the  theme  is  the  same  as  here,  ministry  or  ministration (ver.  1);  and  where  the  christian  revelation  is  described  as \"  the  glory  of  God  in  the  face  of  Jesus  Christ \"  (ver.  6).  This is  tho  key  to  our  passage.  To  the  same  purpose  is  ver.  18, where  the  Christian  is  represented  as  gazing,  through  tho  Gos- pel, with  unveiled  face,  upon  tho  glory  of  God  in  Christ,  and as  being  changed  thereby  into  the  imago  of  Christ.

Wilkinson thinks that it was from this, and not from Apis, that the Israelites borrowed their notions of the golden calf. “The offerings, dancing, and rejoicings practised on the occasion, were doubtless in imitation of a ceremony they had witnessed in honor of Mnevis during their sojourn in Egypt ” (“ Ancient Egyptians,” 2 ser., vol. i1., p. 197).

Star-worship, or Sabaeanism, the rem- nant of the ancient heathenism of Western Asia, which con- sisted in the worship of the stars, and spread into Syria, though the Chaldaean religion was far from being the simple worship of the host of heaven; the heavenly bodies being regarded as real persons, and not mere metaphorical representations of as- tronomical phenomena. It is to the Sabaean worship that Job alludes when, in asserting the purity of his life (xxxi. 26, 27), he says: “If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walk- ing in brightness, and my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hands: this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.” Though not a part of the religion of the Egyp- tians, Rawlinson thinks it may have been connected with their earlier belief, since prayer is represented in hieroglyphics by a man holding up his hands, accompanied by a star (Herodo- tus, vol. ii., p. 291).   43.

The preposition may be explained as combining the ideas of en- trance into and subsequent rest ; and this seems to be the explanation adopted by the Rev. Alford’s rendering, at their taking possession of the Gentiles, is condemned by the fact that xardoxeois does not mean taking possession, but holding possession, which is clearly the meaning in ver. 5, the only other New Testament passage where it occurs, Meyer, in his anxiety to preserve the strict force of év, renders during the possession of the Gentiles, or while the Gen- tiles were in the state of possession, which, though grammatically defensible, I eannot help thinking forced and unnatural.

In 1 Cor. xi. 34, it is translated set in order. The reference is most probably to the Jewish tradition that the law was given through the agency of angels. See Deut. xxxiii. 2. Compare Ps.

Though the pagan authors sometimes used sleep to signify death, it was only as a poetic figure. When Christ, on the other hand, said, ‘ Our friend Lazarus sleepeth (kexoiwnrat),” he used the word, not as a figure, but as the expression of a fact. In that mystery of death, in which the pagan saw only nothingness, Jesus saw continued life, rest, waking—the ele- ments which enter into sleep. And thus, in Christian speech and thought, as the doctrine of the resurrection struck its roots deeper, the word dead, with its hopeless finality, gave place to the more gracious and hopeful word sleep. The pagan burying- place carried in its name no suggestion of hope or comfort. It was a burying-place, a hiding-place, a monumentum, a mere memoreal of something gone; a columbarium, or dove-cot, with its little pigeon-holes for cinerary urns; but the Christian thought of death as sleep, brought with it into Christian speech the kindred thought of a chamber of rest, and embodied it in the word cemetery (Kotuntnpiov)—the place to lie down to sleep.

XUIL   there is a reference to the earlier period of his life. Various explanations are given of the change of name. The most sat- isfactory seems to be that it was customary for Hellenistic Jews to have two names, the one Hebrew and the other Greek or Latin. Thus John was also called Marcus ; Symeon, Viger ; Barsabas, Justus. As Paul now comes prominently forward as the apostle to the Gentiles, Luke now retains his Gentile name, as he did his Jewish name during his ministry among the Jews. The connection of the name Paul with that of the deputy seems to me purely accidental. It was most unlike Paul to assume the name of another man, converted by his instrumen- tality, out of respect to him or as a memorial of his conversion. Farrar justly observes that there would have been in this “an element of vulgarity impossible to St. Paul.”   Set his eyeson him. See on Luke iv. 20.   10. Mischief (faScoupyias). Only here in New Testament. Originally, case or facility in doing ; hence readiness in turning the hand to anything, bad or good; and so recklessness, unscru- pulousness, wickedness. A kindred word (paduotpynpa, lewdness, Rev., vedlany) occurs at ch. xviii. 14.   Right ways. Or straight, possibly with an allusion to Ely- mas’ crooked ways.   11. Mist (ayAvs). Only here in New Testament. The word is used by medical writers as a name for a disease of the eyes. The mention of the successive stages, first dimmess, then total darkness, are characteristic of the physician. “ The first mira- cle which Paul performed was the infliction of a judgment ; and that judgment the same which befell himself when arrested on his way to Damascus” (Gloag).   12.

Lit., those around Paul. In later writers, used to denote the principal person alone, as John xi. 19, came to Mary and Martha; where the Greek literally reads, came to the women around Mary and Martha. Paul, and not Barnabas, now appears as the principal person.   15. Exhortation. See on ch. ix. 31. 16. Beckoning. See on ch. xii. 17. Men of Israel. See on ch. ili. 12.   17. People (Aaod). Restricted in the Acts to the people of Israel.   18. Suffered he their manners (étporopdpycev). From tporros, fashion or manner, and dopéw, to bear or suffer. The preferable reading, however, is érpopopopyeev ; from Tpopos, & nurse; and the figure is explained by, and probably was drawn from, Dent. i.31. The American revisers properly insist on the rendering, as a nursing-father bare he them.   19. Divided by lot (xatexAnpovouncev). The A. V. gives the literal rendering. The Rev., gave them their land for an inheritance, is correct, so far as the meaning inheritance is concerned (see on 1 Pet. i. 4), but does not give the sense of distribution which is contained in the word.   94. Before his coming (apo mpocwrov Ths eicddou avTod). Lit., before the face of his entrance. A Hebrew form of expres- sion.   95. Think ye (iovocire). Originally, to think secretly: hence to suspect, conjecture.   26. To you. The best texts read to us.   33. Hath fulfilled (éeemAjpaxe). Completely fulfilled ; force of éx, out and out.   518 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XIIL   34. The sure mercies (ra dova ta morta). Lit., the holy things, the sure.

Declare (éxdunyfjtav). Only here and ch. xv. 3. See on shew, Luke viii. 39. The word is a very strong expression for the fullest and clearest declaration: declare throughout.   42. Next (werafd). The word commonly means énterme- diate, and hence is explained by some as referring to the in- termediate week. But the meaning is fixed by ver. 44; and though the word does not occur in the New Testament else- where in the sense of neat, it has that meaning sometimes in later Greek.   43. Religious (ceBouévar). Lit., worshipping. Compare ver. 50 and ch. xvi. 14.   Proselytes (zpoondvtwv). Originally, one who arrives at a place; @ stranger ; thence of one who comes over to another faith.  45. Envy (&Aov). Rev., jealousy. See on Jas. iii. 14.   46. Put (arwdJeiode). Not strong enough. Better, as Rev., thrust, denoting violent rejection.   Lo (i500). Marking a crisis.   50. Honorable (evoyjuovas). See on Mark xv. 43. Women of rank, or, as Rev., of honorable estate.   Car. XIV.)

In  the  Septuagint  it does  not  occur,  but  its  kindred  words  are  limited  to  the  sense of  private,  jKraonal.  Trench  (\"  Synonyms  \")  illustrates  the  fact that  in  classical  Greek  there  lies  habitually  in  the  word  \"  a negative  of  the  particular  skill,  knowledge,  profession,  or  stand- ing, over  against  which  it  is  antithetically  set ;  and  not  of  any other  except  that  alone.\"  As  over  against  the  physician,  for instance,  he  is  ISuan}^  in  being  unskilled  in  medicine.  This  is plainly  the  case  here — the  man  who  is  unlearned  as  respects the  gift  of  tongues.  From  llie  original  meaning  of  a  private individual,  the  word  came  to  denote  one  who  was  unfit  for  pub- lic life,  and  therefore  uneducated,  and  dually,  one  whose  mental powers  were  deficient.  Hence  our  idiot.  Idiot,  however,  in earlier  English,  was  used  in  the  milder  sense  of  an  uneducated person.  Thus  \"Christ  was  received  of  idiots,  of  the  vulgar people,  and  of  the  simpler  sort\"  (Blount).  \"What,  wenest thou  make  an  idiot  of  our  dame?\"  (Chaucer,  5893).

In  every  case  the word  means  an  abortion,  a  sttll-bom  embryo.  In  the  same Beuse  it  is  found  frequently  in  Greek  medical  writers,  as  Galen and  Hippocrates,  and  in  the  writings  of  Aristotle  on  physical science.  This  is  the  rendering  of  the  liheims  Version  :  an abortive.  Wye,  a  dead-bom  child.  The  rendering  of  the A.  V.  and  Rev,  is  nn satisfactory,  since  it  introduces  the  notion of  tirne  which  is  not  in  the  original  word,  and  fails  to  express the  abortive  character  of  the  product ;  leaving  it  to  be  inferred that  it  is  merely  jfremaiure,  but  living  and  not  dead.  The word  does  not  mean  an  untim^y  living  birth,  but  a  dead  abor- tion, and  suggests  no  notion  of  lateness  of  birth,  but  rather  of being  born  before  the  time.  The  words  as  uiUo  the  abortion are  not  to  be  connected  with  last  of  aU—last  of  aU  as  to  tlie abortion — because  there  is  no  eongruity  nor  analogy  between the  figure  of  an  aboition  and  the  fact  that  Christ  appeared  to him  last.  Connect  rather  with  He  aj>peared:  last  of  all  lie ajipeared  unto  me  as  unto  the  abortion.  Paul  means  that  when Clirist  appeared  to  bim  and  called  him,  he  was — as  compared with  the  disciples  who  had  known  and  followed  Ilim  from  the first,  and  whom  he  had  been  persecuting — no  better  than  an unperfected  foetus  among  living  men.  The  comparison  em- phasizes his  condition  at  the  time  of  his  call.  The  attempt  to explain  by  a  reference  to  Paul's  insignificant  appearance,  from which  he  was  nicknamed  *'  The  Abortion \"  by  his  enemies, requires  no  refutation.*  10.  Was  not  (oy  iyev^Si})-  Eflv.,  better,  was  not  fou-nd : did  not  turn  out  to  be.  11.  Ye  believed  {tTTurTevaare).  When  the  Gospel  was  first preached :  with  a  suggestion  of  a  subsequent  wavering  from the  faith.  12.  There  is  no  resurrection.  Compare  Aeschylus:  \"But who  can  recall  by  charms  a  man's  dark  blood  shed  in  death, when  once  it  has  fallen  to  the  ground  at  hia  feet  ?     Ilad  this   Ob.

Vain  (leevov).    Empty,  a  mere  chimaera.  17.  Vain  Qutraia).  A  di£Ferent  word,  signifying  fruiden^. The  difference  is  between  reality  and  resnlt.  19.  Only.  To  be  taken  with  the  whole  clause,  at  the  end of  which  it  stands  emphatically.  If  in  this  life  we  are  hopers in  Christ,  and  if  that  is  all.  If  we  are  not  such  as  shall  have hope  in  Christ  after  we  shall  have  fallen  asleep.  20.  The  first-fruits  (aTrop^).  See  on  Jas.  L  18.  Omit become.    Compare  Col.  i.  18,  and  see  on  Apoc.  i.  5.   22.  All — all.  What  the  all  means  in  the  one  case  it  means in  the  other.  23.  Order  (roy/orri).  Only  here  in  the  New  Testament. In  Sept.,  a  hcmdj  troop^  or  cohort;  also  a  etcmdard;  Num.  x. 14 ;  xviii.  22,  25.  How  the  one  idea  ran  into  the  other  may be  perceived  from  the  analogy  of  the  Latin  tnantjnUitSj  a  hand- ful of  hay  twisted  round  a  pole  and  used  by  the  Romans  as  the standard  of  a  company  of  soldiers,  from  which  the  company  itself was  called  numijnUtis.  In  classical  Greek,  besides  the  meaning of  comjxmyy  it  means  an  ordinance  and  a  Jboed  aeeeesment. Here  in  the  sense  of  handy  or  compa/nyj  in  pursuance  of  the principle  of  a  descending  series  of  ranks,  and  of  consequent subordinations  which  is  assumed  by  Paul.  The  series  runs, Gody  Christy  man.  See  ch.  iii.  21-23 ;  xi.  3.  The  reference is  not  to  time  or  merit,  but  simply  to  the  fact  that  each  occupies his  own  place  in  the  economy  of  resurrection,  which  is  one great  process  in  several  acts.  Band  after  band  rises.  First Christ,  then  Christians.  The  same  idea  appears  in  the  first- fruits  and  the  harvest.   *  AeflonUpim.  ",

Coneeniing  this  expression,  of  wliich  some  thirty  different  ex- planations are  given,  it  is  best  to  admit  frankly  that  we  lack the  facts  for  a  decisive  interpretation.  None  of  the  explana- tions proposed  are  free  from  objection.  Paul  is  evidently  al- hiding  to  a  usage  familiar  to  liin  readers;  and  the  term  em- ployed was,  as  Godet  remarks,  in  their  vocabuiary,  a  sort  of technical  phrase.  A  large  number  of  both  ancient  and  modern conmientators  *  adopt  the  view  that  a  living  Christian  was  bap- tized for  an  nnbaptized  dead  Christian.  The  Greek  expositors regarded  the  words  tiie  dead  as  equivalent  to  the  resurrection of  the  dead,  and  the  baptism  aa  a  manifestation  of  belief  in  the doctrine  of  the  resurrection.  Godet  adopts  the  explanation wliieh  refers  baptism  to  martyrdom— the  baptism  of  blood — and cites  Luke  xii.  50,  and  Mark  x.  3S.

Paul,  as  a  Roman  citizen, would  not  have  been  set  to  fight  with  beasts  in  the  arena ;  and such  an  incident  would  not  have  been  likely  to  be  passed  over by  Luke  in  the  Acts.

There  was  a  legend  that  Paul  was thrown,  first  of  all,  to  a  lion ;  then  to  other  beasts,  but  was  left untouched  by  them  all.  In  the  Epistle  of  Ignatius  to  the  Rom- ans occur  these  words :  \"  From  Syria  even  unto  Rome,  I  fight with  beasts,  both  by  land  and  sea,  both  night  and  day,  being bound  to  ten  leopards.

The  traditional  founder  of Tarsus  was  Sardanapalus,  who  was  worshipped,  along  witli Serairamis,  with  licentious  ritea  which  resembled  those  of  the Feast  of  Tabernacles.  Paul  had  probably  witnessed  this  fest- ival, and  had  seen,  at  the  neighboring  town  of  Anchiale,  the statue  of  Sardanapalus,  represented  as  snapping  his  fingers,  and with  tlie  inscription  upon  the  pedestal,  \"Eat,  drink,  enjoy  thy- self.

How,  etc.,  is,  the  body  is raised  through  death  (ver.  36) ;  to  the  second,  with  what  kind of  a  body,  the  answer,  expanded  throughout  nearly  the  whole chapter,  is,  a  spiritual  body.  Body  (a-dfiari).  Organism.  The  objection  assumes  that the  risen  man  must  exist  in  some  kind  of  an  organism ;  and  as this  cannot  be  the  fleshly  body  which  is  corrupted  and  dissolved, resurrection  is  impossible.  S&fjui  body  is  related  to  adpl^  flesh, as  general  to  special;  a&fia  denoting  the  material  organism, not  apart  from  any  matter,  but  apart  from  any  definite  matter - and  adp^  the  definite  earthly,  animal  organism.  See  on  Rom. vi.  6.  The  question  is  not,  what  will  be  the  substance  of  the risen  body,  but  what  will  be  its  organisation  (Wendt)  f  36.  Thou  sowest  {urif  (nrelpei^).  Thou  is  emphatic.  Every time  thou  sowest,  thou  sowest  something  which  is  quickened only  through  dying.  Paul  is  not  partial  to  metaphors  from nature,  and  his  references  of  this  character  are  mostly  to  nature in  connection  with  human  labor.  Dean  Howson  says :  ^^  We find  more  of  this  kind  of  illustration  in  the  one  short  epistle  of St.  James  than  in  all  the  writings  of  St.  Paul \"  (\"  Metaphors of  St.  Paul.\"    Compare  Pamir's  \"  Paul,\"  i.,  20,  21).   280  WORD  STUDIES   IN   THE   NEW   TESTAMENT.

Paul  says :  \"  What  you  sow  is  one body,  and  a  different  body  arises;\"  yet  the  identity  is  pre- served. Dissolution  is  not  loss  of  identity.  The  full  heads  of wheat  are  different  from  the  wheat-grain,  yet  both  are  wheat. Clement  of  Borne,  in  liis  first  Epistle  to  the  Corinthians,  argu- ing for  the  resurrection  of  the  body,  cites  in  illustration  thu fable  of  the  phoenix,  the  Arabian  bird,  the  only  one  of  its  kind, and  which  lives  for  a  hundred  years.  \"When  the  time  of  its death  draws  near  it  builds  itself  a  nest  of  frankincense,  myrrh, and  other  spices,  and  entering  it,  dies.  In  the  decay  of  ils  flesh a  worm  is  produced,  which,  being  nourished  by  the  juices  of the  dead  bird,  brings  forth  feathera.  Then,  when  it  has  ac- quired strength,  it  takes  up  the  nest  with  the  bones  of  its  pa- rent and  bears  them  to  Ileliopolia  in  Egypt.  Bare  {yvii-vov).  Naked.

There  is  a great  variety  of  organization  an>ong  bodies  which  we  know:  it may  fairly  be  inferred  that  there  may  be  a  new  and  different organization  in  those  which  we  do  not  know.

It is  to  be  observed  that  the  apostle  makes  two  general  categories — terrestrial  and  celestial  bodies,  and  shows  the  distinctions  of organization  subsisting  between  the  members  of  each — men, beasts,  fishes,  birds,  and  the  sun,  moon,  stars ;  and  that  he  also shows  the  distinction  between  the  two  categories  regarded  as wholes.

Ilavicig  ai^ied  that  newness  of  organization is  no  argument  against  its  poseibility,  Paul  now  shows  that the  substantial  diversity  of  organism  between  the  earthly  and  the new  man  is  founded  in  a  diversity  of  the  whole  nature  in  the state  before  and  in  the  state  after  the  resurrection.

This  reading  pre- sents a  similar  difficulty  to  that  oi  let  us  ha^oe  in  Rom.  v.  1  (see note).  The  context  and  the  general  drift  of  the  argument  are certainly  against  it.  The  preceptive  or  hortative  subjunctive is,  as  Ellicott  remarks,  singularly  out  of  place  and  nnlooked  for. It  may  possibly  be  a  case  of  itacism^  i.e.,  the  confusing  of  one vowel  with  another  in  pronunciation  leading  to  a  loose  mode  of orthography.  51.

There  will  be some  of  us  Christians  living  when  the  Lord  comes,  but  we  shall be  changed.  The  other  rendering  would  commit  the  apostle  to the  extent  of  believing  that  not  one  Christian  would  die  before the  coming  of  Christ.  52.  Moment  (arofup).

In  a  restricted  sense,  the  northwest  of  Pelop- onnesus ;  but  often  used  by  the  poets  for  the  whole  of  Greece. Under  the  Romans  Greece  was  divided  into  two  provinces, Macedonia  and  Achaia;  the  former  including  Macedonia  proper, with  Illyricum,  Epirus,  and  Thessaly,  and  the  latter  all  that  lay south  of  these.

Thus Demosthenes calls Apollo the watpdos (ancestral god) of Athens. Socrates is asked (Plato, “ Euthydemus,” 302), “ Have you an ancestral Zeus (Zeds ratp@os)?” So, frequently, in the classics. Simi- larly, the Roman phrase, Di patria, “the gods of the forefa- thers.” On the Roman reverence for the ancestral religion, see note on ch. xvi. 21. The Roman’s own sentiment would pre- pare him to respect Paul’s.   15. Allow (mpocdéyovra). Or, as Rev., look for. The word admits of either sense.   582 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.

Of the kindred adjective doxnticds, our word ascetic is a transcript.   Void of offence (drpockorov). Lit., without stumbling ; un- shaken. The word is used thus in a passive sense here, as in Philip. i. 10. In 1 Cor. x. 82, it oceurs in the actwe sense of giving offence to others, or causing them to stumble.   18. Whereupon (év ofs). More correctly, in which (occupa- tion) ; while so engaged. The best texts, however, read év ais, in which, the pronoun agreeing in gender with offerings. The sense, according to this, is, as Rev., margin, 7n presenting which   (offerings).   22. Deferred (adveBadero). Adjourned the case. Only here in New Testament.   | will know the uttermost (dvayvecoua:). Better, as Rev., I will determine. See on ch. xxiii. 15.   23. Liberty (aveow). From avinut, to send up ; thence, to loosen, release. It is almost exactly expressed by our vulgarism, to let up. The noun here is more correctly rendered by Rey., indulgence. In all the other New Testament passages it is ren- dered rest, ease, or relief. See 2 Cor. ii. 13; vii. 5; viii. 18; 2 Thess. i. 7.   To minister (vwnperetv). See on officer, Matt. v. 25.   25. Righteousness, temperance, the judgment to come. Three topics which bore directly upon the character of Felix. Tacitus says of him that he “exercised the authority of a king with the spirit of a slave ;” and that, by reason of the powerful influence at his command, “he supposed he might perpetrate with impunity every kind of villany.” He had persuaded his wife Drusilla to forsake her husband and marry him. He had   Cu. XXV.] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 583   employed assassins to murder the high-priest Jonathan, and might well tremble at the preaching of the judgment to come. Temperance (éyxpateva) is, properly, self-control ; holding the passions in hand.   Trembled (udoBos yevduevos). Lit., having become in fear. Rev., better, was terrified.   For this time (rd viv éyov). Or, for the present. Very literally, as to what has ttself now.   26. He hoped also (dua Sé xa édrrifwv). A comma should be placed after thee (ver. 25), and the participle édaion, hoping, joined with answered: “ Felix answered, ‘Go thy way, CLC, hoping withal that money would be given him.”   Communed (auirec). See on talked, ch. xx. 11.   27. Porcius Festus came into Felix’s room (édaBe Sua- Soxyov 6 PAE TIépxvov Pforov). Kev., better, Feliz was suc- ceeded by Porcius Festus. The Greek idiom is, Melix received Porcius Festus as a successor.   To shew the Jews a pleasure (ydpitas xatatéodar Tots \"Iovdalois). Lit., to lay up thanks for himself with the Jews. Rev., correctly, to gain favor with the Jews.   CHAPTER XX V.   1. Was come into the province (éiBas rh érapyia). Lit., having entered upon the province.   9. Besought.

With an underlying sense of giv- ing him up as @ favor to the Jews.   | appeal (émcxadodpar). The technical phrase for lodging an appeal. The Greek rendering of the Latin formula appello.   12. The council. A body of men chosen by the governor himself from the principal Romans of the province. These were called assessors, sometimes friends, sometimes captains. Though a Roman citizen had the right of appeal to the emperor, a certain discretion was allowed the governors of provinces as to admitting the appeal. It might be disallowed if the affair did not admit of delay, or if the appellant were a known robber or pirate. In doubtful cases the governor was bound to consult with his council, and his failure to do so exposed him to censure. Cicero, in his impeachment of Verres, the brutal governor of Sicily, says: “Will you deny that you dismissed your council,   Cu. XXV.] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 585   the men of rank with whom your predecessor and yourself had been wont to consult, and decided the case yourself?” (ii., 33). That Festus exercised this discretion in Paul’s case is shown by his conferring with the council.   13. Agrippa the king. Herod Agrippa IIL., son of the Herod whose death is recorded in Acts xii. 20-23.   Bernice. Sister of Drusilla, the wife of Felix. She is said to have lived in incestuous relations with her brother. Juvenal, in his sixth satire, alludes to this: “A most notable diamond, made more precious by having been worn on the finger of Ber- nice. This a barbarian king once gave to his incestuous love. This Agrippa gave to his sister.”   16. Opportunity (ré7ov). Lit., place. An unclassical use of the word.   18. Stood up (cra3évtes). See on Luke xviii. 11; xix. 8.   19. Superstition (SevcvSauovias). See on ch. xvii. 22. Ber- ter, religion, as Rev. As Agrippa was a Jew by religion, Fes- tus would not have insulted him by applying the word super- stition to his faith. Note, however, that he speaks of it as their own religion, not identifying Agrippa with them. It was anon-committal expression, since the word meant either religion or superstition according to circumstances. He left Agrippa “to take the word in a good sense, but reserved his own view, which was certainly the Roman one” (Meyer). There is, in- deed, a similar tact in Paul’s use of the word to the Athenians. He selected “a word which almost imperceptibly shaded off from praise to blame” (Trench).*      * ¢¢Bernhardy very aptly remarks that the entrance of the word decrdamovla marks a critical point in the history of the life of the Greek people. Itmarks the wavering between scepticism and despondency. It leaves the conception of the object of religious reverence wavering between God and demon, and thus fearing becomes the dominant notion. Hence the word carries more re- proach than credit” (Zeschwitz, Profangricitat und Biblischer Sprachgeist ).   586 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. XXVI   Affirmed (é¢acxev).

The title “lord ” was refused by the first two emperors, Augustus and Tiberius. The emperors who followed accepted it. In the time of Domitian it was a recognized title. Antoninus Pius was the first who put it on his coins.   27. Crimes (airias). Rev., more correctly, charges.   CHAPTER XX VI. 2. Happy (uaxdpiov). See on blessed, Matt. v. 3. Answer (azronoyeio Sar).

He does not put it asa supposition, but asa fact: ¢f God raises the dead, as you admit that he has the power to do, and as your own writ- ings tell you that he has done.   10. Saints (Trav dyiov). Lit., the holy ones. Paul did not eall the Christians by this name when addressing the Jews, for this would have enraged them; but before Agrippa he uses the word without fear of giving offence. On this word ayios, holy, which occurs over two hundred times in the New Testament, it is to be noted how the writers of the Greek scriptures, both in the New Testament and, what is more remarkable, in the Sep- tuagint, bring it out from the background in which it was left by classical writers, and give preference to it over words which, in pagan usage, represented conceptions of mere externality in religion. Even in the Old Testament, where externality 1s em- phasized, dytos is the standard word for holy.*      * Thus, though the priest is fepeds, the holy place is 7d &yioy, and the most holy place, 7a ayia ray arylov: iepdy is never used in the Septuagint for the temple, except in 1 Chron. xxix. 4; Ezek. xlv. 19; and in both cases the temple is referred to in its outward aspect. In Ezek. xxvii. 6; xxviii. 18, ra iepd is used of the heathen sanctuaries of Tyre. In the New Testament iepds never implies moral excellence. Excepting in the neuter form, 7d fepdr, the temple, it occurs but twice (1 Cor. ix. 18; 2 Tim. iii. 15), and is never used ofa person. Seuvds is reverend ; aryvds, pure, in the sense of chastity, freedom from admixture of evil; and is applied once to God himself (1 John ili. 3). “Oguos is holy by sanction. Trench remarks the sharp distinction maintained   588 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Ca. XXVE   Gave my voice (xarjveyxca Widov). Lit., laid down my vote. See on cownteth, Luke xiv. 28. Some suppose that Paul here refers to casting his vote as a member of the Sanhedrim ; in which case he must have been married and the father of a family. But this there is no reason for believing (compare 1 Cor. vii. 7, 8); and the phrase may be taken as expressing merely moral assent and approval.   12. Whereupon (év ois). See on ch. xxiv. 18. Better, on which errand ; in which affairs of persecution.   13. Above the brightness of the sun. Peculiar to this third account of Paul’s conversion. The other peculiarities are: the falling of his companions to the ground along with himself ; the voice addressing him in Hebrew; and the words, “It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.”   14. It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. Or, goads. The sharp goad carried in the ploughman’s hand, against which the oxen kick on being pricked. The metaphor, though not found in Jewish writings, was common in Greek and Ro- man writings. Thus, Euripides (“ Bacchae,” 791): “ Being en- raged, I would kick against the goads, a mortal against a god.” Plautus (“Truculentus, 4, 2, 55): “If you strike the goads with your fists, you hurt your hands more than the goads.” “Who knows whether at that moment the operation of plough- ing might not be going on within sight of the road along which the persecutor was travelling? (Howson, “ Metaphors of St. Paul”).   16. Have I appeared (d¢9nv). See on Luke xxii. 43.   To make (poxetpicacda). Better, as Rev., appoint. See on ch. iii. 20.      by the Septuagint translators between it and &yos; the two words being used to render two different Hebrew words, and never interchanged. The Greek student will find an interesting discussion of this subject in Zeschwitz, Pro fangracitét und Biblischer Sprachgeist.   Cu. XXVL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 589   A minister and a witness. See on Matt. v. 25; Acts i. 22. 17. The people. The Jews.   22. Help of God (érixovpias tis mapa tod Oeod). Lit., “help that 7s from God.” The article defines the nature of the help more sharply than A. V. The word for help originally meant alliance.   23. That Christ should suffer (ei mantos 0 Xpictos). Rather, ¢7f or whether the Messiah is liable to suffering. He expresses himself in a problematic form, because it was the point of debate among the Jews whether a suffering Messiah was to be believed in. They believed in a triumphant Mes- siah, and the doctrine of his sufferings was an obstacle to their receiving him as Messiah. Note the article, “the Christ,” and see on Matt. i. 1.   24. Much learning doth make thee mad (7a zoddd ce ypdppara eis paviay trepitpére). The A. V. omits the article with much learning: “the much knowledge ” with which thou art busied. Rev., “thy much learning.” Doth make thee mad: literally, is turning thee to madness.   25. Speak forth (azopIéyyouas). See on ch. ii. 4.   28. Almost thou persuadest (€v oAdly@ pe treiJeus). Lit., in alittle thou persuadest. The rendering almost must be rejected, being without sufficient authority. The phrase, im a little, is adverbial, and means in brief; summarily. We may supply pains or talk. “ With little pains, or with a few words.” The words are ironical, and the sense is, “ You are trying to per- suade me off hand to be a Christian.” Thou persuadest (meideus) is, rather, thou art for persuading ; thou attemptest to persuade ; a force which both the present and the imperfect sometimes have.*      * Asin John x. 32: ‘‘ For which of these works ave you for stoning me (Aiwd- ere)?” John xiii. 6: ‘‘ Dost thou mean to wash (vimreis) my feet?” Luke 1.59: “They were for calling (éxédovy) him Zacharias.” Matt, iii. 14: ‘John tried to prevent (S:exddrvey).”   590 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.

Mentioned in the order of their rank.   31. Doeth. Referring, not to Paul’s past conduct, but to the general character of his life.   CHAPTER XX VII. 1. Sail (azromheiv). Lit., sacl away. Band. See on Mark xv. 16.   2. Meaning to sail (wéAXovtes wAciv). This refers the in- tention to the voyagers ; but the best texts read wéAXovTe, agree- ing with wAotw, shep ; so that the correct rendering is, as Rev., a ship—which was about to sail.   8. Touched (xatjyInyuev). From card, down, and dye, to lead or bring. To bring the ship down from deep water to the land. Opposed to dviyInuwev, put to sea (ver. 2); which is to bring the vessel wp (avd) from the land to deep water. See on Luke viii. 22. Youched is an inferential rendering. Landed would be quite as good. From Caesarea to Sidon, the distance was about seventy miles.   Courteously (¢iAavdpérws). Only here in New Testament. Lit., in @ man-loving way ; humanely ; kindly. Rev., kindly,      * So the best texts, instead of roaag, much.   Cu. XXVIL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 591   better than courteously. Courteous, from court, expresses rather polish of manners than real kindness.   To refresh himself (éaiperelas tuyeiv). Lit., to recede care or attention.   4. We sailed under (i7emAcvoaper). Rev., correctly, under the lee of: under the protection of the land.   6. A ship of Alexandria. Employed in the immense corn trade between Italy and Egypt. See ver. 38. The size of the vessel may be inferred from ver. 37.   7. Many (‘cavais). See on Luke vii. 6.   Scarce (uorus). Incorrect. Render, as Rev., with difficulty. So, also, hardly, in ver. 8. The meaning is not that they had scarcely reached Cnidus when the wind became contrary, nor that they had come only as far as Cnidus in many days; but that they were retarded by contrary winds between Myra and Cnidus, a distance of about one hundred and thirty miles, which, with a favorable wind, they might have accomplished in a day. Such a contrary wind would have been the northwesterly, which pre- vails during the summer months in that part of the Archi- pelago.   9. The Fast. The great day of atonement, called “the Fast ” by way of eminence. It occurred about the end of Sep- tember. Navigation was considered unsafe from the beginning of November until the middle of March.   10. I perceive (Sewpa). As the result of careful observa- tion. See on Luke x. 18.   Hurt (&8pews). The word literally means insolence, injury, and is used here metaphorically : insolence of the winds and waves, “like our ‘sport’ or ‘riot’ of the elements” (Hackett). Some take it literally, with presumption, as indicating the folly   592 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. XXVIL   of undertaking a voyage at that season ; but the use of the word in ver. 21 is decisive against this.   Damage (&uias). Better, as Rev., loss. Hurt and damage (A. V.) is tautological. See on the kindred verb, notes on Jose, Matt. xvi. 26, and cast away, Luke ix. 25.   11. Master (cuGepyyty). Only here and Apoc. xviii. 17. Lit., the steersman.   12. Not commodious (avev%érov). Lit., not well situated.   Lieth toward the southwest and northwest (@dé7rovra kata AiBa Kat kata Xepov). Instead of lieth, Rev., literally and correctly, renders looking. The difference between the Rev. and A. V., as to the points of the compass, turns on the rendering of the preposition card. The words southwest and northwest mean, literally, the southwest and northwest winds. According to the A. V., «ard means toward, and has reference to the quarter from which these winds blow. According to the Rev., card means down: “looking down the southwest and northwest winds,” 2.¢., in the direction toward which they blow, viz., northeast and southeast. This latter view assumes that Phenice and Lutro are the same, which is uncertain. For full discussion of the point, see Smith, “ Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul;” Hackett, “Commentary on Acts;” Conybeare and Howson, “ Life and Epistles of St. Paul.”   13. Loosing thence (apavres). Lit., having taken up. It is the nautical phrase for weighing anchor. So Rev.   14. There arose against it ({8anre Kar’ adrfs). Against what? Some say, the island of Crete; in which case they would have been driven against the island, whereas we are told that they were driven away from it. Others, the ship. It is objected that the pronoun avdrijs, tt, is feminine, while the feminine noun for ship (vais) is not commonly used by Luke, but rather the neuter, wAofov. I do not think this objection   Cu. XXVIL] THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. 593   entitled to much weight. Luke is the only New Testament writer who uses vads (see ver. 41), though he uses it but once ; and, as Hackett remarks, “it would be quite accidental which of the terms would shape the pronoun at this moment, as they were both so familiar.’ A third explanation refers the pro- noun to the island of Crete, and renders, “there beat down from it.’ This is grammatical, and according toa well-known usage of the preposition. The verb 8dAXo is also used intran- sitively in the sense of to fall; thus Homer (“ Iliad,” xi., 722), of a river falling into the sea. Compare Mark iv. 87: “the waves beat (éméBadXev) into the ship ; ” and Luke xv. 12: “the portion of goods that falleth (émyBddXor) to me.” The rendering of the Rev. is, therefore, well supported, and, on the whole, preferable: there beat down from it. It is also according to the analogy of the expression in Luke viii. 23, there came down a storm. See note there, and on Matt. vill. 24.   A tempestuous wind (dveuos tupavixds). Lit., a typhonie wind. The word tudav means a typhoon, and the adjective formed from it means of the character of a typhoon.   Euroclydon (EvpoxAvéov). The best texts read Evpaxthon, Euraquilo: i.e. between Hurus, “the E.S.E. wind,” and Aquilo, “the north-wind, or, strictly, N. 4 E.” Hence, E. N. E.   15. Bear up (dvtofJarpeiv). Only here in New Testament. From dvri, opposite, and dpIaruos, the eye. Lit., to look the wind in the eye. The ancient ships often had an eye painted on each side of the bow. To sail “into the eye of the wind” is a modern nautical phrase.   We let her drive (émvddvres ehepopeda). Lit., having gwen up to it, we were borne along.   16.

In modern nautical language, Frapping : passing cables or chains round the ship’s hull in order to support her in a storm. Mr. Smith (“ Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul”) cites the following from the account of the voyage of Captain George Back from the arctic regions in 1837: “A length of the stream chain-cable was passed under the bottom of the ship four feet before the mizzen-mast, hove tight by the capstan, and finally immovably fixed to six ring- bolts on the quarter-deck. The effect was at once manifest by a great diminution in the working of the parts already men- tioned ; and, in a less agreeable way, by impeding her rate of sailing.”   Quicksands (77 ciptw). Therendering of the A. V. is too general. The word is a proper name, and has the article. There were two shoals of this name—the ‘ Greater Syrtis” (Syrtis Major), and the “Smaller Syrtis” (Syrtis Minor). It was the former upon which they were in danger of being driven ; a shallow on the African coast, between Tripoli and Barca, southwest of the island of Crete.   Strake sail (yaddcavtes 70 cxevos). Lit., as Rev., lowered the gear. See on goods, Matt. xii. 29. It is uncertain what is referred to here. To strike sail, it is urged, would be a sure way of running upon the Syrtis, which they were trying to avoid. It is probably better to understand it generally of the gear connected with the fair-weather sails. ‘ Every ship sit- uated as this one was, when preparing for a storm, sends down upon deck the ‘ top-hamper,’ or gear connected with the fair- weather sails, such as the topsails. A modern ship sends down top-gallant masts and yards; a cutter strikes her topmast when preparing for a gale” (Smith, “Voyage,” etc.). The storm: sails were probably set.   Cu.

Some suppose it to refer to the main-yard ; an immense spar which would re- quire the united efforts of passengers and crew to throw over- board. It seems improbable, however, that they would have sacrificed so large a spar, which, in case of shipwreck, would support thirty or forty men in the water.

Besides the resemblance to Second Peter, the epistle is marked by its apocryphal references, especially to the Book of Enoch (see notes on 9, 14). In style it is terse and picturesque. “Tt is Greek as learned by a foreigner, and partly from books, and it is mixed up with Hebrew phrases.” It contains at least fifteen words not found elsewhere in the New Testament. Dean Alford says: “It is an impassioned invective, in which the writer heaps epithet on epithet, and image on image, and re- turns again and again to the licentious apostates against whom he warns the church, as though all language were insufficient to give an adequate idea of their profligacy, and of his own abhor- rence of their perversion of the grace and doctrines of the Gospel.”   THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER.

Tur name “catholic” is applied to the epistle of James, the two epistles of Peter, the three of John, and the epistle of Jude. The term is variously explained, some regarding it as equivalent to canonical, others as opposed to heretical, and as applied to writings which agree with the doctrines of the uni- versal church. Others, again, suppose that this group of epistles was so designated, in order to distinguish it from the two other groups formed by the Gospels and Acts, and the Pauline epis- tles, as a general collection of the writings of other apostles.  The better explanation is that they are called “catholic,” or general, because addressed to no particular church or individual, but to a number of scattered churches or people (see 1 Pet. i. 1, and James i. 1). In this sense the term does not strictly apply to the second and third epistles of John, which are addressed to individuals, and includes them only when regarded in the light of appendices to the first epistle. We speak in this Intro- duction of the epistles of James, Peter, and Jude only, reserving remarks on the epistles of John for the general introduction to the Johannine writings, in the second volume.   THE EPISTLE OF JAMES.   According to the oldest arrangement of the New Testament, the epistle of James stands first in order of all the apostolical epistles. The most competent critics generally agree in desig-   616 INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE.   nating as its author James, the president of the church at Jerusalem, and known as the Lord’s brother.  “No doubt,” says Dean Stanley, “if we look at James’ in- fluence and authority from the more general point of view, whether of the whole Jewish Christian world or of the whole Gentile Christian world, it sinks into nothing before the majesty of Peter and Paul;” but within the circle of the purely Pales- tinian Christians, and in Jerusalem, James is the chief repre- sentative of the Christian society. The later traditions of the Jewish Christians invest him with a priestly sanctity. His austerities and devotions are described in extravagant terms. He is said to have kneeled until his knees were as hard as the knees of camels, and to have been constant in prayer in the temple. He went barefoot, and practised abstinence from wine, and wore the long hair, the linen ephod, and the unshorn beard of the Nazarites, and even abstained from washing. He was known as ‘The Just.” The people vied with each other to touch the hem of his garment; and he is reputed to have called down rain in the drought, after the manner of Elijah. THis chair was preserved as a relic until the fourth century, and a pil- lar in the valley of Jehoshaphat marked the spot where he fell.  The account of his martyrdom is given by Eusebius from the lost work of Hegesippus, by Josephus, and in the Clementine Recognitions. In Hegesippus and the Recognitions, the story is dramatic and deeply tinged with romance. The narrative of the former “is,” says Dr. Schaff, “an overdrawn picture of the middle of the second century, colored by Judaizing traits, which may have been derived from ‘the Ascents of James’ and other apocryphal sources.” It is, substantially, as follows: Having been asked, “ What is the gate of Jesus?” he replied that he was the Saviour; from which some be- lieved that Jesus is the Christ. The Jews and Scribes and Pharisees, becoming alarmed, came to James, and besought him to restrain the people from going after Jesus, to persuade against him all that came to the Passover, and, with this view, to stand on the pinnacle of the temple, where he might be seen and heard by all the people. They accordingly placed him there, and said, “O Just One, to whom we all give heed, inas-   INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE. 617   much as the people is gone astray after Jesus who is crucified, tell us what is the gate of Jesus?” He answered, with a loud voice, “Why ask ye me concerning Jesus, the Son of man ? He sits in heaven, on the right hand of the mighty power, and he is also about to come in the clouds of heaven.” Many being convinced, and saying, “ Hosanna to the Son of David!” the Scribes and Pharisees said, “ We have done ill in furnishing so great a testimony to Jesus. Let us go and cast him down.” They went up then and threw him down, and as he was not killed by the fall they began to stone him. And he, turning round, knelt and said, “I beseech thee, Lord God and Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” But while they were thus stoning him, one of the priests, of the sons of Rechab, cried, saying, “Stop! whatdoye? The Just One prays for you;” and one of them, one of the fullers, took the club with which he used to press the cloths, and struck it on the head of the Just One. And so he bore witness, and they buried him on the place by the temple.  The epistle was probably written from Jerusalem, where James would be likely to become acquainted with the condition of the Jews, through those who came up at the feasts. Certain allusions in the epistle go to confirm this. The comparison of the double-minded man to a wave of the sea (i. 6), and the pict- ure of the ships (iii. 4), might well be written by one dwelling near the sea and familiar with it. The illustrations in. i. 11; 12—the figs, the oil, the wine, the salt and bitter springs—are furnished by Palestine, as are the drought (v. 17, 18), the former and the latter rain (v. 7), and the hot, parching wind (i. 11), for which the name xavowv was specially known in Palestine.  The epistle is written from a Jewish stand-point. “ Chris- tianity appears in it, not as a new dispensation, but as a develop- ment and perfection of the old. The Christian’s highest honor is not that he is a member of the universal church, but that he is the genuine type of the ancient Israelite. It reveals no new principle of spiritual life, such as those which were to turn the world upside down in the teaching of Paul or of John, but only that pure and perfect morality which was the true fulfilment of   618 INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE.   the law” (Stanley). Twice only the name of Christ occurs (i. 1; ii. 1); the word “gospel” not at all; and there isno allusion to Redemption, Incarnation, Resurrection, or Ascension. The rules of morality which he lays down are enforced by Jewish rather than by Christian motives and sanctions. The violation of the “royal law” is menaced with the sentence of the law (ii. 8, 18); and uncharitable judgment is deprecated on the ground of the law’s condemnation, and not as alien to the spirit of Christ.  At the same time, the very legalism of the epistle is the out- growth of the Sermon on the Mount, the language of which it reflects more than any other book of the New Testament. It meets the formalism, the fatalism, the hypocrisy, the arrogance, insolence, and oppression engendered by the sharp social dis- tinctions of the age, with a teaching conceived in the spirit, and often expressed in the forms of the Great Teacher’s moral code. “The epistle,” says Dr. Scott, “strikes the ear from beginning to end as an echo of the oral teaching of our Lord. There is scarcely a thought in it which cannot be traced to Christ’s per- sonal teaching. If John has lain on the Saviour’s bosom, James has sat at his feet.”  The following correspondences may be noted :   Marruew.

Links connecting them with the historic individuality of the writer, which are so numerous in the case of Peter, are almost entirely wanting. The expression, ‘“ Hearken, my beloved brethren ” (ii. 5), suggests the similar phrase, Acts xv. 13; and the ordinary Greek greeting, yalpew, hail (Acts xv. 23), is re- peated in Jas. i. 1; the only two places where it occurs in a Christian epistle. The purity of the Greek, and its comparative freedom from Hebraisms, are difficult to account for in a writer who had passed his life in Jerusalem. The style is sententious and antithetic; the thoughts not linked in logical connection, but massed in groups of short sentences, like the proverbial say- ings of the Jews; with which class of literature the writer was evidently familiar. His utterance glows with the fervor of his spirit; it is rapid, exclamatory, graphic, abrupt, sometimes poetical in form, and moving with a rhythmical cadence. “ It combines pure and eloquent and rhythmical Greek with He. brew intensity of expression.”   THE EPISTLES OF PETER.   The life and character of the apostle Peter are familiar to all readers of the Gospels and Acts. It has already been shown in the Introduction to the Gospel of Mark how the style and diction of that gospel exhibit the influence of Peter, and how the characteristics which appear in the Acts, in those scenes in which Peter was the only or the principal actor, reappear in the second gospel. If these epistles are from his pen, we may therefore expect to find in them traces of the keen-sightedness, the ready application of what is observed, and the impulsiveness   620 INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE.   and promptness which appear in the other two books, always allowing for the difference between a narrative and a hortatory style.  It has been observed that “the sight, and what it should do and reap, fills a great space in Peter’s letters.” Accordingly, we read that God’s salvation is ready to be revealed in the last time (1, i. 5); the angels desire to look into the mysteries of the gospel (1, i. 12); Christ was manifested at the end of the times (1, i. 20); the Gentiles shall behold your good works (1, ii. 12); unbelieving husbands shall be convinced by behold- ing the chaste behavior of their wives (1, iii. 2); the apostle was a witness of Christ’s sufferings (1, v. 1), and an eye-witness of his majesty (2, i. 16); the elders must exercise oversight of the flock (1, v. 2). Similarly he speaks of the day of wzsza- tion, or, lit., overlooking (1, ii. 12); Christ is the beshop, lit., overseer, of souls (1, ii. 25); he who lacks Christian graces is blind, seeing only what is near (2, i. 9); Lot was vexed at seemng the wickedness of his neighbors (2, ii. 8); the wicked have eyes full of adultery (2, ii. 14).  Equally apparent is his readiness to apply what he sees and hears. ‘Not one thought,” says Canon Cook, “ connected with the mystery of salvation is presented without an instant and emphatic reference to what a Christian ought to feel, and what he ought to do. No place in the spiritual temple is so humble that he who holds it has not before him the loftiest sphere of spiritual action and thought. Injunctions which touch the heart most powerfully are impressed upon us as we contemplate the eternal glory, the manifestations of Christ’s love.’ Thus we have sanctification of the spirit wnto obedience (1, i. 2); be holy in deweng (1,1. 15). The first epistle abounds in exhorta- tions to personal religion (ii. 10-18 5 iii. 1-16; iv. 1-11 ; v. 1-9). Christian graces shall make believers to be neither zd@le nor wn- Sruitful (2, i. 8); they shall not fall if they do these things (2, 1. 10); he exhorts to holy dwg and godliness (2, iii. T1). z  It is in such pointed and practical exhortations as these that the prompt and energetic character of the apostle reappears. Dr. Davidson observes that the writer is “zealous, but mild, earnest, but not fervid;” a statement which is adapted to pro-   INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE. 621   voke a smile from one who has felt the nervous grip of the first epistle, and which becomes palpably absurd if we admit, as of course Dr. Davidson does not, the authenticity of the second. The “mild tone” assuredly is not dominant there; but, in any event, it would be strange if the letters did not show traces of the mellowing of years, and of the ripening of the spirit of Christ in this once passionate and headstrong disciple. The second chapter of the second epistle is no feeble reminder of the Peter who smote off the ear of Malchus.  The graphic and picturesque character of these letters is nota- ble. In the two epistles, containing eight chapters, the longest of which consists of but twenty-five verses, there are one hun- dred and nineteen words which occur nowhere else in the New Testament. Picture-words abound, such as @pudpevos, roaring (1, v. 8); drdlcacSe, arm yourselves (1, iv. 1); émuxadvppa, cloke (1, ii. 16); dysotv, put to silence, lit., muzzle (1, ii. 15); oxor.s, froward, lit., awry or twisted (1, ii. 18); exrevdis, Ser- vently, lit., on the stretch (1, i. 22); dmdtecis, putting off (2, i. 14); é£o80s, decease (2, i. 15); Stavydfew, dawn (QALeieys aiyynpos, dark or dry (2, i. 19); eidvors, interpretation, lit., untying (2, i. 20); otpeBrodow, wrest, as with a windlass (2, ili, 16), and many others.  The same graphic character appears in what may be styled reminiscent words or phrases, in which the former personal ex- perience of the writer is mirrored. Thus, gird yourselves with humility (1, v.5, see note there) recalls the picture of the Lord girded with a towel and washing the disciples’ feet. Zo look into (1, i. 12) expresses a stooping down to gaze intently, and carries us back to the visit of Peter and John to the sepulchre on the morning of the resurrection, when they stooped down and looked into the tomb. In feed the flock (Rev., zend, 1, v. 2) is reflected Christ’s charge to Peter at the lake. The recurrence of the word dpocwromjprras, without respect of persons (1, i. 17), used in a kindred form by Peter, Acts x. 34, would seem to indicate that the scene in the house of Cornelius was present to his mind ; and be watchful (1, v. 8) may have been suggested by the remembrance of his own drowsiness in Gethsemane, and of Christ’s exhortation to watch. So, too, it is interesting to read   622 INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE.   the words buffeted (A, ii. 20), the tree (ro EvAov, an unusual word, used by him, Acts v. 30; x. 39), and stripe or weal (1, il. 24), in the light of the gospel narratives of Christ’s sufferings. Christ had called Simon @ rock, and a little later a stwmbling-block. Peter combines both words into one phrase, a rock of offence (1, ii. 8). A very striking instance appears in the reference to the Transfiguration (2, i. 17, 18), where he uses the peculiar word é£060s, decease ; lit., going out, which occurs in Luke ix. 31, and also in Heb. xi. 22. Compare, also, tabernacle, in 2,.1. 13, 14, with let ws make three tabernacles.  Both epistles are pervaded with an Old-Testament atmos- phere. The testimony of Old-Testament prophecy, teaching, and history is emphasized (1, i. 10-12; iii. 5, 6, 20; 2, 1. 19- 21; ii. 1, 4-8, 15, 16; iii. 2, 5, 6). Old-Testament quotations and references are brought into the text, though the intro- ductory formulas, because it ts written, and wherefore it is con- tained in scripture, do not occur in the second epistle; and the interweaving, as of familiar expressions, is not so conspicuous there as in the first. epistle (see 1, i. 16, 24, 25; ii. 6, 7, 9, 10, 23,124,010; 6,, 1014: eiy. 8) 18% ty 259 (342, .15 19-21 ser ba; 7, 15, 21; iii. 5, 6, 8, 13). The church of Christ is repre- sented as the church of Israel perfected and spiritualized (1, ii. 4-10); the exhortation to holiness (1, i. 15, 16) is given in the language of Lev. xi. 44; Christ is described (1, ii. 6) in the terms of Isaiah xxviii. 16, and Ps. exviii. 22; and the prophetic utterance of Isaiah concerning the servant of Jehovah (lii. 13- lili. 12) reappears in 1, ii. 28, 24.  The epistles are evidently the work of a Jew. We find, as we might expect, the writer illustrating his positions from Jew- ish history and tradition, as in his references to Noah, Sarah, Balaam, and his use of the word pavticpos, sprinkling (A, i. 2), a peculiarly Levitical term. He shows how the spirit of Christ dwelt in the Old-Testament prophets, and how Christians are a royal priesthood.  The resemblance, both in ideas and expressions, to pas- sages in the epistles of Paul and James is marked, especially in the first epistle. It will be instructive to compare the fol- lowing :   INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE. 623   JAMES. 1 Perer. Te We 3), 1, One pee KO a inl i 24s i. 18. Tes iv. 6, 10. Vans 05 v. 20. iv. 8.

Nor are such resemblances wanting in the second epistle, though they are resemblances in tone, subject, and spirit, rather than verbal. It is in this epistle that Peter designates Paul’s writings as scripture (ili. 16). Compare   Pauvt. 2 Pater. Rom. i. 28; iii. 20. sh 7.

Gal. ii. 4. rirt, ab   Into the much-vexed question of the authenticity of the sec- ond epistle we are not called upon to enter. The point of dif- ferences of style between the two epistles is a fair one. There   624 INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE.   are such differences, and very decided ones, though perhaps they are no more and no greater than can be explained by diversity of subject and circumstances, and the difference in the author’s age. Some of the expressions peculiar to the second epistle are—granting things which pertain unto life and godli- ness (i. 8); precious and exceeding great (i. 4) ; adding all dili- gence, and supply virtue (i. 5); an entrance richly supplied (i. 11); receiving forgetfulness (i. 9) ; sects of perdition (ii. 1) 5 cast down to Tartarus (ii.4); the world compacted out of water and by means of water (iii. 5), ete.  But, while allowing for these differences, and recognizing the weakness of the external evidence for the authenticity of the epistle, the internal evidence of style and tone seems to us to outweigh the differences, and to show that both epistles were from the same hand. There is the same picturesqueness of diction, and a similar fertility of unusual words. Of the one hundred and twenty words which occur only in the writings of Peter, fifty-seven are peculiar to the second epistle; and, what is still more noteworthy, only one of these words, azrodeats, putting off, is common to the two epistles—a fact which tells very strongly against the hypothesis of a forgery. That hypoth- esis, it may be observed, is in the highest degree improbable. The Christian earnestness, the protest against deception, the tender and adoring reminiscence of Christ, the emphasis upon the person and doctrine of the Lord Jesus which mark this epistle, imply a moral standard quite inconsistent with the per- petration of a deliberate forgery.  Comparisons of expressions in this epistle with those used or inspired by Peter in the Acts of the Apostles exhibit a close correspondence ; and a correspondence, which, however, must not be too strongly pressed, appears on a comparison with cer- tain passages in the gospels. Thus the verb dwpéopas, to give, occurs only in Mark xv. 45, and 2 Pet. i. 3, 4 (see Introduction to Mark, on the relations between Mark and Peter); and the recurrence of the words exodus, or decease, and tabernacle in the same connection (2 Pet. i. 138-15, 17, 18) is very striking from the pen of one who, at the Transfiguration, heard the heavenly visitants conversing of Christ’s decease, and who pro   INTRODUCTION TO JAMES, PETER, AND JUDE. 625   posed to build ¢abernacles for their abode. The repeated use of the word ornpite, stablish, and its derivatives (i. 12; ili. 17; ii. 14; iii. 16) is also suggestive, in view of the admonition of Jesus to Peter by the same word—strengthen thy brethren (Luke xxii. 32).  There is the same retrospective character in both epistles. In both the writer teaches that prophecy does not carry its own interpretation ; in both he alludes to the small number saved from the flood; both have the same sentiments on the nature and right use of Christian liberty, and on the value of prophecy ; in both dper7, virtue, is attributed to God, a use of the word occurring nowhere else in the New Testament.  The style of both epistles is vigorous rather than elegant, strong, and sometimes rough, the work of a plain, practical man, and of an observer rather than a reasoner, whose thoughts do not follow each other in logical sequence. The fervid spirit of the writer appears in his habit of massing epithets, and repeating his thoughts in nearly the same words and forms (see, for in- stance, 1 Pet. 1.4; ii 4,11; 1.19; i1.9. Also, i. 7, and iv. 12; i. 13, and iv. 7, v.8; i.14, and ii. 11, iv. 2; ii. 15, and ii. 1,16; ii. 19, and iii. 14, iv. 14. 2 Pet. i. 4, 8,17; ii. 10, 11, 12-15; iii. 15). Professor Ezra Abbot has brought out some remark- able correspondences between this epistle and the writings of Josephus, and maintains that the author of the letter is largely dependent upon the Jewish historian (Hzpositor, 2d series, iii., 49). The second epistle of Peter cannot be studied apart from   THE EPISTLE OF JUDE.   This brief letter is assigned to the Judas of Matt. xii. 55, one of the brethren of Jesus, and of James, the author of the catholic epistle. It is a hotly debated question whether Peter’s second letter or Jude’s epistle is the earlier, and, consequently, which writer drew upon the other. It is quite evident, either that the one used the other’s epistle or that both drew from a common source. A satisfactory decision is impossible in the present state of the evidence.

IL] THE FIRST GENERAL EPISTLE OF PETER. 6438   bodied in Christ’s commission to him, of a building erected upon a rock. The metaphor of a house built of living stones is violent, and sufficiently characteristic of Peter; yet it pict- ures, in a very striking way, the union of stability, growth, and activity in the ideal church. Note the transition from babes growing (ver. 2) to stones built up. But, as Salmond remarks, “In Paul we have even bolder instances of apparent confusion of metaphors, as when, in one breath, he represents believers as at once walking, rooted, and built up in Christ (Col. ii. 6, 7).   To offer up (avevéyxar). The usual Old-Testament (Septua- gint) term for offering of sacrifice. Lit., to bring up to the altar. Compare Heb. xiii. 15. The force of avd, wp, appears in the fact of the altar being raised. The word is often used of carry- ing from a lower to a higher place. Thus Matt. xvii. 1; Luke xxiy. 51. In this sense ver. 24 of this chapter is suggestive, where it is said that Christ bare (avijveyxey) our sins: carried them up to the cross. See note there.   6. It is contained (aepséyer).

The distinction between these three words cannot be closely pressed. /?ace emphasizes the idea of descent ; nation, of community. Aaos, people, oc- curring very often in the Septuagint, is used there mostly of the Israelites, the chosen people. The same use is also fre- quent in the New Testament; but it is employed in a more general sense, as by Luke ii. 10. It would seem that this idea, however, in its metaphorical and Christian application, the chosen Israel of God, directed Peter’s choice of the word, since he adds, a people for God’s own possession.   Peculiar (es wepimoinow). Lit., a people for acquasition. Rev., a people for God’s own possession. Wyec., a people of purchasing. Cranmer, a people which are won. The word occurs 1 Thess. v. 9, rendered obtaining (Rev.); Eph. i. 14, God's own possession (Rev.).

It is a technical word, meaning one who was admitted to the highest degree of initiation in the Eleusinian mysteries. Here it con- veys the idea of personal witness ; behold with their own eyes.   Evil-doers (xaxoroiwv). The word occurs four times in Peter, and nowhere else in the New Testament except John xviii. 30, where it is applied by the priests to Christ himself.   Visitation (éicxomfjs). The radical idea of the word is that of observing or inspecting. Hence émicxorros, an overseer or bishop. Visiting grows naturally out of this, as wsitare from visere, to look at attentively. See Introduction, on Peter’s em- phasis upon sight; and compare behold, in this verse. The “day of visitation ” is the day of looking upon: “ When God   646 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu.

In classical Greek it is an ignorance arising from not coming into contact with the person or thing to be known. It occurs only once again in the New Testament, 1 Cor. xv. 34.

Paul uses the kindred verb (Rom. iv. 7) of the covering of sins. On the sentiment, compare Gal. v. 13.   18. Servants (oixéras). Household servants. So Rev., in margin. Not a common term in the New Testament, occur- ring only in three other passages: Luke xvi. 13 ; INGE 9:0. 1S Rom. xiv. 4. Some suppose that Peter intended to cover by it freedmen and other dependants in the household, or that he uses it with a conciliatory purpose, as presenting the slave in closer relation with the family.   Gentle (évexéow). A common derivation of this word is from elke, to yield. Hence the meaning, md, yrelding, wn- dulgent. But the true derivation is from eixos, reasonable , and the word implies rather the not being unduly rigorous ¢ “Wherein not strictness of legal right, but consideration for one another, is the rule of practice” (Alford). Compare Philip. iv. 5, where, for moderation (rd émuetkés), Rev. gives forbear- ance, with gentleness in margin. According to Aristotle, the word stands in contrast with dxpiBodlxasos, one who rs exuct- ingly just, as one who is satisfied with less than has due.   Froward (cxodwois). Lit., crooked. See Luke iii. 5. Peter uses the word in Acts ii. 40 (wntoward) ; and Paul, in Philip. ii. 15 (crooked). The word froward is Anglo-Saxon fream-ward or from-ward,the opposite of to-ward. (See untoward, above.) Thus Ben Jonson:   “¢ Those that are froward to an appetite ; ”   ie., averse. Compare the phrases to- God-ward (2 Cor. iii. 4); to-us-ward.   19. Conscience toward God (cuveidnow Oeod). Rev., in margin, conscience of God. The idea is not conscientiousness in the ordinary sense, but the conscious sense of one’s relation to God; his consciousness of God. Thus one suffers patiently,   648 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu. IL   not from a conscientious sense of duty, but from an inner con- sciousness of his relation to God as a son, and to Christ as a joint-heir, which involves his suffering with him no less than his being glorified with him.   20. What glory (crofov xréos). Lit., what kind of glory. This word for glory occurs nowhere else in the New Testament.   Buffeted (xoradifowevor). See Matt. xxvi. 67: struck with the fist. This whole passage, vv. 19-24, bears the mark of Peter’s memories of the scene of Christ’s last sufferings (see Introduction)—the blows of the servants, the scorn of the high- priest, the silent submission of Jesus, the cross, the stripes.   21. Leaving (i7roArdvev). Only here in the New Testa- ment.   An example (izoypaupyov). Only here in the New Testa- ment. A graphic word, meaning a copy set by writing-masters for their pupils. Some explain it as a copy of characters over which the student is to trace the lines.   Follow (éraxorovdnonte). Lit., follow wpon. The com- pound verb implies close following. From writers and painters, the metaphor changes now to a guide.   22. Found (evpédn). Stronger than the simple was, and in- dicating a guilelessness which had stood the test of scrutiny. Compare Matt. xxvi. 60; John xviii. 88; xix. 4, 6. Christ’s sinlessness had also stood the test of Peter’s intimacy.   23. Reviled—again (dvteAoddper). Only here in the New Testament.   Committed himself (rapediéov). But this gives a reflexive force to the verb which has no parallel.

Peter uses the same pecu- liar term for the cross, Acts v. 30; x. 39.   Being dead (dmoyevouevor). Rev., more strictly, having died. Used here only in the New Testament. The rendering of the verb can be given only in a clumsy way, having become off unto sins ; not becoming separate from sins, but having ceased to exist as regards them. Compare Rom. vi. 18.   Stripes (uérw7s). Lit., bruese. So Rev., in margin.

For ye were as sheep going astray (ire yap ws mpoBata TAaV@pEvol) ; 2.€., a8 commonly understood, ye were like straying sheep.

Answer (émepérnua). Only here in New Testament. In classical Greek the word means a question and nothing else. The meaning here is much disputed, and can hardly be settled satisfactorily. The rendering answer has no warrant. The meaning seems to be (as Alford), “the seeking after God of a good and pure conscience, which is the aim and end of the Christian baptismal life.” So Lange: “The thing asked may be conceived as follows: ‘ How shall Irid myself of an evil con- science? Wilt thou, most holy God, again accept me, a sin- ner? Wilt thou, Lord Jesus, grant me the communion of thy death and life? Wilt thou, O Holy Spirit, assure me of grace and adoption, and dwell in my heart?’ To these questions the triune Jehovah answers in baptism, ‘Yea!’ Now is laid the solid foundation for a good conscience. The conscience is not only purified from its guilt, but it receives new vital power by means of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.”  This is the sense of éwepwrav eis, in the only place where it occurs in scripture, 2 Sam. xi. 7 (Sept.): “David asked of him how Joab did (érepworncev eis eipyynv’IwaB).” Lit., woth reference to the peace of Joab.

V. and Rev.), which would not attract attention in an assembly where most persons wore a ring, but @ gold-ringed man, having his hands conspicuously loaded with rings and jewels. The ring was regarded as an indispensable article of a Hebrew’s at- tire, since it contained his signet; and the name of the ring, tabbath, was derived from a root signifying to impress a seal. It was a proverbial expression for a most valued object. See Isa. xxii. 24; Hag. ii. 23. The Greeks and Romans wore them in great profusion. Hannibal, after the battle of Cannae, sent as a trophy to Carthage, three bushels of gold rings from the fingers of the Roman knights slain in battle. To wear rings on the right hand was regarded as a mark of effemi- nacy ; but they were worn profusely on the left. Martial says of one Charinus that he wore six on each finger, and never laid them aside, either at night or when bathing. The fops had rings of different sizes for summer and winter. Aristophanes distinguishes between the populace and those who wear rings, and in his comedy of “The Clouds” uses the formidable word ofppayidovuyapyoxophtat, lazy, long-haired fops, with rings and well-trimmed nails. Demosthenes was so conspicuous for this kind of ornament that, at a time of public disaster, it was stigmatized as unbecoming vanity. Frequent mention is made of their enormous cost. They were of gold and silver, some- times of both ; sometimes of iron inlaid with gold. The pos- sible beauty of these latter will be appreciated by those who have seen the elegant gold and iron jewellery made at Toledo, in Spain. Sometimes they were of amber, ivory, or porcelain. The practice of wearing rings was adopted by the early Chris- tians. Many of their rings were adorned with the symbols of the faith—the cross, the anchor, the monogram of Christ, etc. Among the rings found in the catacombs are some with a key, and some with both a key and a seal, for both locking and seal- ing a casket.   Goodly apparel (éo9/7 Xaurpa). Lit. bright or shining clothes. Rev., fine clothing.   Cn It THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 739   Vile (6u7rapa). Compare ch. i. 21; and see on 1 Pet. in. 21.   3.

Under. Not literally wnderneath, but down on the ground beside. Compare Matt. xxiii. 6, on the fondness of the Jews for the chief places in the synagogue.   4. Are ye not partial in yourselves ? (ov Svexpidnre év éavrois). Wrong. The constant sense of the verb in the New Testament is doubt, except Acts xi. 2; Jude 9, where it means dispute. Compare ch. i. 6. The meaning here is, therefore, that, in making a distinction between the rich and the poor, they expressed a doubt concerning the faith which they professed, and which abolished such distinctions. Hence, Rev., rightly, Are ye not divided in your own mind ?   Judges of evil thoughts («pital Siaroywouav rovnpdy). Better, as Rev., “judges with evil thoughts.” The form of ex- pression is the same as in Luke xviii. 6, «pestis Tis aducias, the judge of injustice, ie., the unjust judge. So Jas. 1. 25, a hearer of forgetfulness. The word thoughts is, rather, reason- ings. See on deceiving yourselves (ch. i. 22). Compare Luke v.21. Their evil processes of thought lead to these unjust dis- criminations.   5. Hearken, my beloved brethren. Alford cites this phrase as one of the very few links which connect this epistle with the speech of James in Acts xv. 13.   The poor of this world (rods mra@xovds Tod Koopov). But the correct reading is 7 xiao, to the world ; and the ex- pression is to be explained in the same way as dotetos TO Oe,   740 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu.

The Rev., properly, inserts to be, since the words are not in apposition with poor, but express the object for which God has chosen them. Faith is not the gualeéy in which they are to be rich, but the sphere or element ; rich in their position as believers. ‘Not the measure of faith, in virtue of which one man is richer than another, is before the writer’s mind, but the substance of the faith, by virtue of which every believer is rich” (Wiesinger, cited by Alford).   6. Despised (jryudcate). Not strong enough. They had manifested their contempt ; had done despite to them. Rev., correctly, dishonored. From the use of the aorist tense, ye dis- honored, which the A. V. and Rev. render as a perfect, ye have dishonored, the reference would appear to be to a specific act like that described in vv. 2, 3.   Oppress (xataSuvacrtevovorv). Only here and Acts x. 38. The preposition card, against, implies a power exercised for harm. Compare being lords over, 1 Pet. v. 3, and ewercise do- minion, Matt. xx. 25, both compounded with this preposition.   Draw (éacovow). Not strong enough. The word implies violence. Wence, better, as Rev., drag. Compare Livy’s phrase, “ g lictoribus trahi, to be dragged by the lictors to judgment ; ” Acts viii. 3, of Saul haling or hauling men and women to prison ; and Luke xii. 58.

By this epithet the disgracefulness of the blasphemy is empha- sized.   Cu, IL.]j THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 741   By the which ye are called (70 érucrndev ef vuas).  Lit., which is called upon you ; the name of Christ, invoked in bap- tism. The phrase is an Old-Testament one. See Deut. xxviii. 10, where the Septuagint reads that the name of the Lord has been called upon thee. Also, 2 Chron. vii. 14; Isa. iv. 1. Com- pare Acts xv. 17.   8. Fulfil the royal law (vouov terete Baoihixov). The phrase occurs only here and Rom. ii. 27. Teretv, fulfil, is stronger than the more common word tnpety, observe or keep, which appears in ver. 10. Compare, also, Matt. xix. 17; xxii. 3; John xiv. 15, etc. James here speaks of a single com- mandment, the proper word for which is évtody, while voyos is the body of commandments. It is appropriate here, how- ever, since this special commandment sums up the entire law. See Rom. xiii. 10; Gal. v.14. It is the royal law; the king of all laws.  The phrase royal law is of Roman origin (Jew regia). In the kingly period of Roman history it did not signify a law pro- mulgated by the absolute authority of the king, but a law passed by a popular assembly under the presidency of the king. In later times the term was applied to all laws the origin of which was attributed to the time of the kings. Gradually the term came to represent less of the popular will, and to include all the rights and powers which the Roman people had formerly pos- sessed, so that the emperor became what formerly the people had been, sovereign. “It was not,” says Gibbon, “before the ideas and even the language of the Romans had been corrupted, that a royal law (dew regia) and an irrevocable gift of the people were created. . . . The pleasure of the emperor, accord- ing to Justinian, has the vigor and effect of law, since the Roman people, by the royal law, have transferred to their prince the full extent of their own power and sovereignty. The will of a single man, of a child, perhaps, was allowed to prevail over the wisdom of ages and the inclinations of millions; and the degenerate Greeks were proud to declare that in his hands alone the arbitrary exercise of legislation could be safely depos- ited ” (“ Decline and Fall,” ch. xliv.).   742 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. IL   9, Ve have respect to persons (apoowmoAnpr retire). Only here in New Testament. See on ver. 1.   Ye commit sin (duapriav epydgeo9e). Lit., “work sin.” Compare Matt. vii. 28; Acts x. 35 ; Heb. xi. 33. The phrase is rather stronger than the more common duaprtiav rovetv, to do sin, John viii. 34; Jas. v.15; 1 Pet. ii. 22. The position of sin is emphatic: “it is se that ye are working.”   And are convinced (éreyxdpevor). Rather, as Rev., con- victed. The word, which is variously rendered in A. V. tell a fault, reprove, rebuke, convince, while it carries the idea of 7e- buke, implies also a rebuke which produces a conviction of the error or sin. See on John viii. 46. Compare John iii. 20; viii. 9; 1 Cor. xiv. 24, 25.   10. Keep (tnpjon). See on ver. 8. Offend (araicy). Lit., as Rev., stumble.   He is guilty (yéyovev evoyos).

Huther cites a Talmudic parallel : “ But if he perform all, but omit one, he is guilty of every single one.”   11. A transgressor (zapaBdrns). From mapa, beyond, and Balve, to go. A transgressor, therefore, is one who goes beyond the line. So, also, trespass, which is transpass, from the Latin trans, across, aud passus, a step. A similar word occurs in Homer, bmepBacia, a transgression or trespass, from vb7rép, over, and Baiva, to go.   12. So. With reference to what follows, speak and do.   13. He shall have judgment without mercy that hath shewed no mercy (7) yap Kplois dvirews TO un) ToinoavTs   Cu. II.) THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 743   eos). Lit., as Rev., judgment is without mercy to him that hath shewed no mercy. Both A. V. and Rev. omit the article “the judgment,” that, namely, which is coming. [TZath shewed, or, lit., shewed (aorist tense). The writer puts himself at the stand-point of the judgment, and looks backward.   Rejoiceth (cataxavyatat). The simple verb xavydopas means to speak loud, to be loud-tongued ; hence, to boast. Better, therefore, as Rev., glorieth. Judgment and mercy are personified. While judgment threatens condemnation, mercy interposes and prevails over judgment. “Mercy is clothed with the divine glory, and stands by the throne of God. When we are in danger of being condemned, she rises up and pleads for us, and covers us with her defence, and enfolds us with her wings” (Chrysostom, cited by Gloag).   14. What doth it profit 2? (ri 7d dgedos). Lit., what is the profit? \"Odedos, profit, only here, ver. 16, and 1 Cor. xv. 32.   15. Be (irdpywow). The distinction between this word and the simple eivau, to be, is very subtle. The verb vTrapY® origi- nally means to make a beginning ; hence, to begin or to come into being ; and, though used substantially as a synonym of elvat, of a thing actually existing and at hand, it has a back- ward look to an antecedent condition which has been protracted into the present. Thus we might paraphrase here, “If a brother or sister, having been in a destitute condition, be found by you in that condition.” Eivas, on the other hand, would simply state the present fact of destitution. See on 2 Pet. i. 8.   Destitute (Aevmopuevor). Lit., left behind ; and hence lacking, as Rev. Compare ch. i. 4,5. This usage of the word occurs in James only.   Daily (é¢nyépov).

Only here in New Testament. It means, originally, to be rough on the surface; to bristle. Hence, used of the fields with ears of corn; of a line of battle bristling with shields and spears; of a silver or golden vessel rough with embossed gold. Aeschylus, describing a crowd holding up their hands to vote, says, the air bristled with right hands. Hence, of a horror which makes the hair stand on end and contracts the surface of the skin, making ‘‘ goose- flesh.” Rev., much better, shudder.   20. Vain (xevé).

Not was confirmed, which the word does not mean either in New-Testament or in classi- cal usage, but was actually and fully realized. James here uses the formula which in the Old Testament is employed of the realizing of a former utterance. See 1 Kings ii. 27; 2 Chron. xxxvi. 22 (Sept.).   Imputed (€doyicIn). Lit., as Rey., reckoned.   He was called the friend of God. The term, however, does not occur either in the Hebrew or Septuagint, though it is found in the A. V. and retained in Rev. Old Testament. In 2 Chron. xx. 7 (Sept.), thy friend is To Ayarnwev@ cou, thy be- loved. In Isa. xli. 8 (Sept.), my friend is bv yyarnoa, whom T loved. “The friend of God” is still the favorite title of Abraham among the Jews and Mohammedans.   95. Rahab. Also referred to in Heb. xi. 31, among the ex- amples of faith. Dante places her in the third heaven:   “ Thou fain wouldst know who is within this light That here beside me thus is scintillating, Even as a sunbeam in the limpid water. Then know thon, that within there is at rest Rahab, and being to our order joined, With her in its supremest grade ’tis sealed.   First of Christ’s Triumph was she taken up.  Full meet it was to leave her in some heaven, Even as a palm of the high victory  Which he acquired with one palm and the other, Because she favored the first glorious deed   Of Joshua upon the Holy Land.” Paradise, ix., 112-125.

As the ship which conveyed Paul to Malta, which contained two hundred and seventy-six persons (Acts xxvii. 37).   Fierce (cxdnpav). More literally, and better, as Rev., rough.

III.   mind. The authorized version has taken the word in one of its secondary senses, hardly the philosophical sense it would seem ; but any departure from the earlier sense was not only needless, but impaired the vividness of the figure, the familiar and nat- ural image of a forest on fire. So Homer:   ‘* As when a fire Seizes a thick-grown forest, and the wind Drives it along in eddies, while the trunks Fall with the boughs amid devouring flames.” Miad, xi., 155.   Hence, Rev., rightly, “‘ Behold how much wood or how great a Sorest is kindled by how small a fire.  This, too, is the rendering of the Vulgate: guam magnam silvam.   6. World of iniquity («dopos tis aduxias). Koopos, prima- rily, means order, and is applied to the world or universe as an orderly system. A world of iniquity is an organism con- taining within itself all evil essence, which from it permeates the entire man. World is used in the same sense as in the lat- ter part of Prov. xvii. 6 (Sept.), which is not given in the A.V. “The trusty hath the whole world of things, but the faithless not a groat.”   Is the tongue (ka¥icratat). This differs a little from the simple zs, though it is not easy to render it accurately. The verb means to appoint, establish, institute, and is used of the tongue as having an appointed and definite place in a system (among our members). It might be rendered hath dts place.   Defileth (omAotca). Lit., defiling. Only here and Jude 23. See on 2 Pet. ii. 13.   Setteth on fire (proylfouca). Lit., setting on fire. Only in this verse in New Testament.

IL] THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 749   tpéxo, to rwn, applies generally to anything round or cireular which runs or rolls, as a wheel or sphere. Hence, often a wheel. Used of the circuit of fortifications and of circles or zones of land or sea. From the radical sense, to run, comes the meaning course, as the course of the sun; and from this a place for running, a race-course. Tevécews, rendered nature, means origin, beginning, birth, manner of birth, production, and is used by Plato for the creation, or the sum of created things. It also means a race, and a generation or age. In the New Testament it occurs but twice outside of this epistle, viz., at Matt. i. 1, “the book of the generation of Jesus Christ,” where the meaning is origin or birth ; the birth-book of Jesus Christ. The other passage is Matt. i: 18, according to the best texts, also meaning birth. In Jas. i. 23, as we have seen, mpocwroy Ths yevecens is the face of his birth. We may then safely translate tpoyds by wheel ; and as birth is the meaning of yéveous in every New-Testament passage where it occurs, we may give it the preference here and render the wheel of birth— i.e., the wheel which is set in motion at birth and runs on to the close of life. It is thus a figurative description of human life. So Anacreon:   “The chariot-wheel, like life, runs rolling round.”   Tertullian says: “The whole revolving wheel of existence bears witness to the resurrection of the dead.” The Rev., which gives nature, puts berth in margin. This revolving wheel is kindled by the tongue, and rolls on in destructive blaze. The image is justified by the fact. The tongue works the chief mischief, kindles the most baleful fires in the course of life.   7. Kind (dors). Wrong. James is not speaking of the rela- tion between individual men and individual beasts, but of the relation between the nature of man and that of beasts, which may be different in different beasts. Hence, as Rev., in margin, nature.   Beasts (Inpiwv). Quadrupeds. Not beasts generally, nor wild beasts only. In Acts xxviii. 4, 5, the word is used of the   750 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.

Doth a fountain, etc. The interrogative particle, uyru, which begins the sentence, expects a negative answer. Foun- tain has the article, “‘ the fountain,” generic. See Introduction, on James’ local allusions. The Land of Promise was pictured to the Hebrew as a land of springs (Deut. viii. 7; xi. 11). “ Palestine,” says Dean Stanley, “was the only country where an Eastern could have been familiar with the language of the Psalmist: ‘ He sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the mountains.’ Those springs, too, however short- lived, are remarkable for their copiousness and beauty. Not only not in the East, but hardly in the West, can any fountains and sources of streams be seen, so clear, so full-grown even at their birth, as those which fall into the Jordan and its lakes throughout its whole course from north to south” (“ Sinai and Palestine”). The Hebrew word for a fountain or spring is dyin, meaning an eye. “The spring,” says the same author, ‘“‘is the bright, open source, the eye of the landscape.”*   Send forth (pve). An expressive word, found nowhere else in the New Testament, and denoting a full, copious dis- charge. Primarily it means éo be full to bursting ; and is used, therefore, of budding plants, teeming soil, etc., as in the charm- ing picture of the sacred grove at the opening of the ‘‘Oedi- pus Coloneus” of Sophocles: “full (Bptwv) of bay, olive, and vine.” Hence, to burst forth or gush. Though generally in- transitive, it is used transitively here.   Place (dmfs). Rather, opening or hole in the earth or rock. Rev., opening. Compare caves, Heb. xi. 38. The word is pleasantly suggestive in connection with the image of the eye of the landscape. See above.      * See Scott's ‘‘ Castle Dangerous,” ch. i,   752 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu.

So can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. The best texts omit so can no fountain, and the and between salt and fresh. Thus the text reads, ovre GAVKOV YAVKV TroLhoat HSwp. Render, as Rev., neither can salt water yield sweet. An- other of James’ local allusions, salé waters. The Great Salt Sea was but sixteen miles from Jerusalem. Its shores were lined with salt-pits, to be filled when the spring freshets should raise the waters of the lake. A salt marsh also terminated the valley through which the Jordan flows from the Lake of Tiberias to the Dead Sea, and the adjoining plain was covered with salt streams and brackish springs. Warm springs impregnated with sulphur abound in the voleanic valley of the Jordan. “Advxov, salt, occurs only here in the New Testament.   13. Wise and endued with knowledge (codds Kai émic- anv). A rendering needlessly verbose, yet substantially cor- rect. Probably no very nice distinction was intended by the writer. It is somewhat difficult to fix the precise sense of cogos, since there is no uniformity in its usage in the New Testament. In classical Greek it primarily means skilled in a handicrafé or art. Thence it runs into the sense of clever, in matters of com- mon life, worldly wise. Then, in the hands of the philosophers, it acquires the sense of learned in the sciences ; and, ironically, abstruse, subtle, obscure, like the English cwnning, which origi- nally meant knowing or skilful, and is often used in that sense in the English Bible (see Gen. xxv. 27; 1 Sam. xvi. 16).  In the New Testament codds is used—1. In the original classi- cal sense, skilled in handicraft (1 Cor. iii. 10). 2. Accomplished in letters, learned (Rom. i. 14, 22; 1 Cor. i. 19, 26; iii. 18). So of the Jewish theologians and doctors (Matt. xi. 25), and of Christian teachers (Matt. xxiii. 34). 3. In a practical sense, of the practice of the law of piety and honesty; so Eph. v. 15, where it is joined with walking circumspectly, and 1 Cor. vi. 5, where it is represented as the quality adapted to adjust differ-   Cu. IIL] THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF JAMES. 753   ences in the church. 4. In the higher, philosophical sense, of devising the best counsels and employing the best means to carry them out. So of God, Rom. xvi. 27; 1 Tim. i. 17; Jude 25; 1 Cor. i. 25. In this passage the word appears to be used in the sense of 3: practical wisdom in pious living.  ’Emotijpev occurs only here in the New Testament. In clas sical Greek it is often used like codés, in the sense of skilled, versed ; and by the philosophers in the higher sense of scventy- cally versed, in which sense it is opposed by Plato to dofacrHs, a mere conjecturer. In this passage copds would seem to be the broader, more general, and perhaps more dignified term of the two, as denoting the habit or quality, while eTLOTHULOV indicates the special development and intelligent application of the quality to particular things. The Rev., wise and under- standing, gives the distinction, on the whole, as nearly as is necessary.   Conversation (dvactpodijs). See on 1 Pet. i. 15.   Meekness of wisdom. On meekness, see on Matt. v. 5. The meekness which is the proper attribute of wisdom.   ‘« Knowledge is proud that she has learned so much, Wisdom is humble that she knows no more.”   14. Envying (&j\\ov). The word is used in the New Testa- ment both in a bad and a good sense. For the latter, see John ii. 17; Rom. x. 2; 2 Cor. ix.2. From it is our word zeal, which may be either good or bad, wise or foolish. The bad sense is predominant in the New Testament. See Acts v. 17; Rom. xiii. 13; Gal. v. 20, and here, where the bad sense is de- fined and emphasized by the epithet better. It is often joined with épus, strife, as here with épidea, intriguing or faction. The rendering envying, as A. V., more properly belongs to @9évos, which is never used in a good sense. mulation is the better general rendering, which does not necessarily include envy, but may be full of the spirit of self-devotion. .

It is a word in which the sound sug- gests the sense (rhoizedon) ; and the kindred noun, potfos, is used in classical Greek of the whistling of an arrow; the sound of a shepherd’s pipe; the rush of wings ; the plash of water ; the hiss- ing of a serpent; and the sound of filing.   The elements (ctovyeta). Derived from ototyos, a row, and meaning originally one of a row or series ; hence a compo- nent or element. The name for the letters of the alphabet, as being set inrows. Applied to the four elements—fire, air, earth, water; and in later times to the planets and signs of the zodiac. It is used in an ethical sense in other passages; as in Gal. iv. 3, “elements or rudiments of the world.” Also of elementary teaching, such as the law, which was fitted for an earlier stage in the world’s history ; and of the first principles of religious knowledge among men. In Col. ii. 8, of formal ordinances. Compare Heb. v. 12. The kindred verb orovyéw, to walk, car- ries the idea of keeping in line, according to the radical sense. Thus, walk according to rule (Gal. vi. 16); walkest orderly (Acts xxi. 24). So, too, the compound ovatovyéw, only in Gal. iv. 25, answereth to, lit., belongs to the same row or column with. The Greek grammarians called the categories of letters arranged according to the organs of speech ovotovyiat. Here the word is of course used in a physical sense, meaning the parts of which this system of things is composed. Some take it as meaning the heavenly bodies, but the term is too late and technical in that sense. Compare Matt. xxiv. 29, the powers of the heaven.   Shall melt (AvIjcovrat). More literally, as Rev., shall be dissolved.   With fervent heat (kavoovpeva). Lit., being scorched up.   11. To be dissolved (Avoyévwv). So Rev.

Iam inclined to adopt, with Alford, Huther, Salmond, and Trench, the transitive mean- ing, hastening on; i.e., “causing the day of the Lord to come more quickly by helping to fulfil those conditions without which it cannot come; that day being no day inexorably fixed, but one the arrival of which it is free to the church to hasten on by faith and by prayer” (Trench, on “The Authorized Version of the New Testament”). See Matt. xxiv. 14: the gospel shall be preached in the whole world, “and ¢hen shall the end come.” Compare the words of Peter, Acts iii. 19: “Repent and be converted,” etc., “that so there may come seasons of refreshing ” (so Rev., rightly) ; and the prayer, “ Thy kingdom come.” Sal- mond quotes a rabbinical saying, “If thou keepest this precept thou hastenest the day of Messiah.” This meaning is given in margin of Rey.

Jude. Rev., Judas. One of the brethren of Jesus ; not the brother of James the Apostle, the son of Alphaeus, but of James the superintendent of the church at Jerusalem. He is named among the brethren of the Lord. Matt. xiii. 55; Mark vi. 3.   Servant. He does not call himself an apostle, as Paul and Peter in their introductions, and seems to distinguish himself from the apostles in vv. 17,18: “The apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, how that they said,” etc. We are told that Christ’s brethren did not believe on him (John vii. 5); and in Acts i. the brethren of Jesus (ver. 14) are mentioned in a way which seems to separate them from the apostles. AotaAos, bond-servant, occurs in the introductions to Romans, Philip- pians, Titus, James, and 2 Peter.   Brother of James. That Jude does not allude to his rela- tionship to the Lord may be explained by the fact that the natural relationship in his mind would be subordinate to the spiritual (see Luke xi. 27, 28), and that such a designation would, as Dean Alford remarks, “ have been in harmony with those later and superstitious feelings with which the next and following ages regarded the Lord’s earthly relatives.” He would shrink from emphasizing a distinction to which none of the other disciples or apostles could have a claim, the more so because of his former'unbelief in Christ’s authority and mission. It is noticeable that James likewise avoids such a designation.   732 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu L   Kept. See on 1 Pet.i.4. Compare John xvii. 6, 12.   In Jesus Christ (Incod Xpictd).

The verb means to get in by the side (aapd), to slip in by a side-door. Only here in New Testament.   Cx. LJ THE EPISTLE OF JUDE. M3   Ordained (poyeypaypévor). The meaning is in dispute. The word occurs four times in New Testament. In two of these instances po has clearly the temporal sense before (Rom. xv. 4; Eph. iii. 3). In Gal. iii. 1, it is taken by some in the sense of openly, publicly (see note there). It seems better, on the whole, to take it here in the temporal sense, and to render written of beforehand, i.e., in prophecy as referred to in vv. 14, 15. So the American Rev.   Lasciviousness. See on 1 Pet. iv. 3.   Lord God. God is omitted in the best texts. On Lord (Sec7rornv), see on 2 Pet. ii. 1.   5. Ye once knew (eidotas da). Entirely wrong. The participle is to be rendered as present, and the once is not for- merly, but once for all, as ver. 3. So Rev., rightly, though ye know all things once for alt.   6. First estate (apy7v). The word originally signifies be- ginning, and so frequently in New Testament, mostly in the Gospels, Acts, Hebrews, Catholic Epistles, and Apocalypse. From this comes a secondary meaning of soverecgnty, dominion, magistracy, as being the beginning or first place of power. So mostly by Paul, as principalities (Rom. viii. 38); rude (L Cor. xv. 24). Compare Luke xii. 11, magistrates ; Rev., rulers ; and Luke xx. 20, power. Rev., rule. A peculiar use of the word occurs at Acts x. 11, “the sheet knit at the four corners (apyais);” the corners being the beginnings of the sheet. In this passage the A. V. has adopted the first meaning, beginning, in its rendering jirst estate. Rev. adopts the second, rendering principality. The Jews regarded the angels as having do- minion over earthly creatures ; and the angels are often spoken of in the New Testament as apyat, principalities; as Rom. viii. 838; Eph. i. 21; so that this term would be appropriate to designate their dignity, which they forsook.

Under darkness (ro Sédov). Under carries the sense of the darkness brooding over the fallen spirits. On darkness, see on 2 Pet. ii. 4.

The force of é« is out and out; giving themselves up utterly. See on followed, 2 Pet. 1. 16.   Going after (amedJotcat omicw). The aorist participle. Rev., having gone. The phrase occurs Mark i. 20; James and John leaving their father and going after Jesus. “The world is gone after him” (John xii. 19). Here metaphorical. The force of avo is away; turning away from purity, and going after strange flesh.   Strange flesh. Compare 2 Pet. ii. 10; and see Rom.i. 27; Ley. xviii. 22,23. Also Jowett’s introduction to Plato’s “ Sym- posium ;” Plato’s “ Laws,” vill., 836, 841; Déllinger, “The Gentile and the Jew,” Darnell’s trans., ii., 238 sq.   Are set forth (apoxewrar). The verb means, literally, to ie exposed. Used of meats on the table ready for the guests; of a corpse laid out for burial; of a question under discussion. Thus the corruption and punishment of the cities of the plain are laid out in plain sight.   As an example (defyya). Only here in New Testament. From delevum, to display or exhibit; something, therefore, which is held up to view as a warning.   Cx. I] THE EPISTLE OF JUDE. 715   Suffering the vengeance of eternal fire (arupos aiwviov dikenv Uréxovoa). Reyv., rightly, substitutes punishment for ven- geance, since dix carries the underlying idea of right or justice, which is not necessarily implied in vengeance. Some of the best modern expositors render are set forth as an example of eternal fire, suffering punishment. This meaning seems, on the whole, more natural, though the Greek construction favors the others, since eternal fire is the standing term for the finally condemned in the last judgment, and could hardly be correctly said of Sodom and Gomorrah. Those cities are most truly an example of eternal fire. “A destruction so utter and so per- manent as theirs has been, is the nearest approach that can be found in this world to the destruction which awaits those who are kept under darkness to the judgment of the great day” (Lumby). Suffering (iréyoveat). Only here in New Testa- ment. The participle is present, indicating that they are suffer- ing to this day the punishment which came upon them in Lot’s time. The verb means, literally, to hold under ; thence to up- hold or support, and so to suffer or undergo.   8. Vet (uévror). Not rendered by A. V., but expressing that though they have these fearful examples before them, yet they persist in their sin.   Dominion—dignities (xvpidrnta—dd£as). It is not easy to determine the exact meaning of these two terms. Kupiérns, ‘dominion, occurs in three other passages, Eph. i. 21; Col. i. 16; 2 Pet. ii. 10. In the first two, and probably in the third, the reference is to angelic dignities. Some explain this passage and the one in Peter, of evd angels. In Colossians the term is used with thrones, principalities, and powers, with reference to the orders of the celestial hierarchy as conceived by Gnostic teach- ers, and with a view to exalt Christ above all these. Glories or dignities is used in this concrete sense only here and at 2 Pet. iat).   9. Michael the archangel. Here we strike a peculiarity of this epistle which caused its authority to be impugned in very   716 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. (Cu.   early times, viz., the apparent citations of apocryphal writings. The passages are vv. 9, 14, 15. This reference to Michael was said by Origen to be founded on a Jewish work called “The Assumption of Moses,” the first part of which was lately found in an old Latin translation at Milan; and this is the view of Davidson, so far at least as the words “ the Lord rebuke thee” are concerned. Others refer it to Zech. iii. 1; but there is nothing there about Moses’ body, or Michael, or a dispute about the body. Others, again, to a rabbinical comment on Deut. xxxiv. 6, where Michael is said to have been made guardian of Moses’ grave. Doubtless Jude was referring to some accepted story or tradition, probably based on Deut. xxxiv. 6. Fora similar reference to tradition compare 2 Tim. ili. 8; Acts vii. 22.   Michael. Angels are described in scripture as forming a society with different orders and dignities. This conception is developed in the books written during and after the exile, especially Daniel and Zechariah. Michael ( Who 7s like God ?) is one of the seven archangels, and was regarded as the special protector of the Hebrew nation. He is mentioned three times in the Old Testament (Dan. x. 13, 21; xii. 1), and twice in the New Testament (Jude 9 ; Apoc. xii. 7). He is adored as a saint in the Romish Church. For legends, see Mrs. Jameson, “ Sacred and Legendary Art,” i., 94 sq.   A railing accusation (xpicw Bracdnpias). Lit., a judg- ment of railing; a sentence savoring of impugning his dignity. Michael remembered the high estate from which he fell, and left his sentence to God.   10. Compare 2 Pet. ii. 12.   They know not (ov« oiéacw).

Often used by our Lord, but never else- where except here and in the Apocalypse. The expression in 1 Cor. ix. 16 is different. There the word is not used as an impreca- tion, but almost as a noun: “* Woe is unto me.” So Hos. ix. 12   (Sept.).   Ran greedily (éfeyvIncav). Lit., were poured out. Rev., ran riotously. A strong expression, indicating a reckless, aban- doned devotion of the energies, like the Latin effundi. So Tacitus says of Maecenas, “ he was given up to love for Bathy]- lus ;” lit., poured out into love.   After. Better, as Rev., im ; as, “in the way of Cain.” The error was their sphere of action. Similarly,   In the gainsaying (79 dvtiAoyia). In the practice of gain- saying like Korah’s. ’Avtvdoyia is from art, against, and déyo, to speak. Hence, literally, contradiction. Gainsay is a literal translation, being compounded of the Anglo-Saxon gegn, which reappears in the German gegen, against, and say.   Korah. Who spake against Moses (Num. xvi. 3). The water which Moses brought from the rock at Kadesh was called the water of Meribah (Strife), or, in Septuagint, dowp avriAoyias, the water of contradiction.   12. Spots (omirdées). Only here in New Testament. So rendered in A. V., because understood as kindred to omivor (2 Pet. ii. 13); but rightly, as Rev., hidden rocks. So Homer, (“« Odyssey,” iii., 298), “ the waves dashed the ship against the rocks (amtrdbeccw).” See on deceivings, 2 Pet. ii. 13. These men were no longer mere Doés, but elements of danger and wreck.   718 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu. L   When they feast with you. See on 2 Pet. ii. 13.   Feeding (aowpatvorres).

Clouds without water. Compare 2 Pet. ii. 17, springs without water. As clouds which seem to be charged with re- freshing showers, but are borne past (wapadepdpevar) and yield no rain.

Not only the apparent death of winter, but a real death ; so that it only remains to pluck them up by the roots.   13. Raging (@ypia).

Blackness (%édos). See on 2 Pet. ii. 4.   Of darkness (rod cxorous). Lit., “the darkness,” the article pointing back to the darkness already mentioned, ver. 6.   14. Enoch prophesied. This is the second of the apocry- phal passages referred to in notes on ver. 9. It is quoted from the apocryphal book of Enoch, directly, or from a tradition based upon it. The passage in Enoch is as follows: “ Behold he comes with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon them, and to destroy the wicked, and to strive (at law) with all the carnal for everything which the sinful and ungodly have done and committed against him.” The Book of Enoch, which was known to the fathers of the second century, was lost for some centuries with the exception of a few fragments, and was found entire in a copy of the Ethiopic Bible, in 1773, by Bruce. It became known to modern students through a translation from this into English by Archbishop Lawrence, in 1821. It was probably written in Hebrew. It consists of rev- elations purporting to have been given to Enoch and Noah, and its object is to vindicate the ways of divine providence, to set forth the retribution reserved for sinners, angelic or human, and “to repeat in every form the great principle that the world— natural, moral, and spiritual—is under the immediate govern- ment of God.” Besides an introduction it embraces five parts: 1. A narrative of the fall of the angels, and of a tour of Enoch in company with an angel through heaven and earth, and of the mysteries seen by him. 2. Parables concerning the king- dom of God, the Messiah, and the Messianic future. 3. Astro- nomical and physical matter; attempting to reduce the images of the Old Testament to a physical system. 4. Two visions, representing symbolically the history of the world to the Mes- sianic completion. 5. Exhortations of Enoch to Methuselah and his descendants. The book shows no Christian influence,   720 WORD STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. [Cu, L   is highly moral in tone, and imitates the Old Testament myths.   With ten thousands of his saints (év dylaus pupidow). Lit., in or among holy myriads. Compare Deut. xxxili. 2; Zech. xiv. 5.   Ungodly (aceBeis)—ungodly deeds (épywv daceBelas, lit., works of ungodliness) which they have ungodly committed (jo¢8noav), and of all their hard speeches which ungodly (aceBeis) sinners, etc. The evident play upon the word wn- godly can be rendered but clumsily into English. Rev., trans- lates, All the ungodly, of all their works of ungodliness which they have ungodly wrought, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. The words ungodly sinners are placed in an unusual position, at the end of the sen- tence, for emphasis; ungodliness being the key-note of the writ- er’s thought.   Hard (trav cxAnpav). Speeches issupplied. Lit., hard things. So Rev. The railing, gainsaying ; the profane and vain bab- blings (2 Tim. ii. 16). Compare John vi. 60, @ hard saying, where the word means not abuswe but dificult. In Jas. iii. 4, rough, used of the winds. In Acts xxvi. 14, of Saul of Tarsus ; “ hard to kick against the pricks.”   16. Murmurers (yoyyvorat). Only herein New Testament. Doubtless, originally, with some adaptation of sound to sense, gongustat. It is used of the cooing of doves.   Complainers (jeuipospor). From péudopar, to find fault with, and potpa, a part or lot. Lit., blamers of their lot.   Great swelling words. See on 2 Pet. ii. 18. Having men’s persons in admiration (Savudfovtes mpdc-   wa). The Rey., shewing respect of persons, is neater, but the A.

See 2 Pet. ii. 3, 14. Beloved. Compare ver. 3. 18. Mockers. See on 2 Pet. iii. 3.   Ungodly lusts (é7iIupudas tov doeBedv). Lit., lusts of ungodlinesses.   19. Separate themselves (dzrodvopifovres). Only here in New Testament. Zhemselves is unnecessary. Better, as Rev., make separations ; i.e., cause divisions in the church. The verb is compounded with ard, away ; did, through ; Bpos, a boundary line. Of those who draw a line through the church and set off one part from another.   Sensual (uyuKo/). See on Mark xii. 30. As apuyy denotes life in the distinctness of individual existence, “the centre of the personal being, the T of each individual,” so this adjective derived from it denotes what pertains to man as man, the natural personality as distinguished from the renewed man. So 1 Cor. ii. 14; xv. 44. The rendering senswal, here and Jas. iii. 15, is inferential: senswal because natural and wnrenewed: In contrast with this is   The spirit. The higher spiritual life. So the adjective avevpatixos, spiritual, is everywhere in the New Testament opposed to uyines, natural. See 1 Cor. xv. 44, 46.   22. And of some have compassion, making a difference.

Thb  life  and  labors  of  Paul  are  folly  treated  in  well-known and  easily  accessible  works.  His  language  and  style  will  be discussed  in  the  fourth  and  final  volume  of  this  work.  I  shall confine  this  introduction  to  an  account  of  the  several  epistles treated  in  the  present  volume.  1*HB   EPISTLB  TO  THB  BOMAllB.  The  Roman  Church  had  been  for  some  tinie  in  existence when  Paul  wrote  this  epistle  (see  ch.  i.  8,  10,  12,  13  ;  xv.  23). That  he  was  acquamted  with  many  of  its  members  appears from  the  salutations  in  the  sixteenth  chapter.  In  Acts  xxviii. 15,  the  existence  of  the  Church  is  assumed  as  well  known,  and the  company  which  meets  the  apostle  at  Appii  Forum  has  clear- ly the  character  of  a  deputation.  The  date  and  circumstances of  the  origin  and  organization  of  the  Church  cannot,  however, be  certainly  determined.  The  Church  consisted  of  both  Jews  and  Gentiles ;  but  the predominance  of  the  Gentile  element  is  apparent  from  the epistle  itself  (see  ch.  i.  5,  12-16  ;  iii.  27-30  ;  iv.  6  ;  vi.  19  ;  xi. 13,  25,  28,  30 ;  xv.  1,  8,  15).*  Paul  had  long  desired  to  preach  the  Gospel  at  Rome,  but when,  apparently,  on  the  eve  of  accomplishing  his  wish,  his plan  was  complicated  by  the  necessity  of  visiting  Jerusalem with  the  collection  for  \"  the  poor  saints.\"  He  did  not,  in  any event,  contemplate  a  long  stay  in  Rome,  intending  to  take  it en  routs  for  £pain.     Being  thus  delayed,  he  determined  to   *  The  itndent  will  find  a  dear  tammarj  of  the  eridenoes  for  the  Gentile charaeter  of  the  Church  in  Weias*  **  Introduction  to  the  New  Testament**   X  DiTHODCCTION.  write  at  once,  in  order  botli  to  meet  the  immediate  needs  of  the Church  and  to  prepare  the  way  for  his  personal  presence.  The epistle  was  written  during  his  last  visit  at  Corinth  (Acts  xx.  2, 3),  and  was  despatclied  by  the  liands  of  Phoebe  the  deaconess,* about  A.D.  59-  Its  authenticity  is  generally  conceded,  together with  the  fact  that  it  was  written  in  Greek,  though  some  Roman Catholic  critics  have  maintained  that  it  was  written  in  Latin, There  is  nothing  surprising  in  its  having  been  written  in Greek,  since  the  Greek  language  was  prevalent  at  Rome,  hav- ing become  indeed  the  general  language  of  the  world,  and  the composition  of  the  letter  in  Greek  accords  with  Paul's  Hellenic associations  and  training.  The  Latin  fathers  never  claim  their own  language  as  the  original  of  any  part  of  the  Xew  Testa- ment, and  Ignatius,  Justin,  and  Irenaeua  all  wrote  in  Greek  to Eomans.  The  aim  of  the  epistle  is  didactic  rather  than  polemic,  though it  acquires  a  polemic  flavor  in  its  opposition  of  Christianity  to legalism.  It  is  distinguished  among  the  epistles  by  its  system- atic character.  Its  object  is  to  present  a  comprehensive  state- ment of  the  doctrine  of  salvation  through  Christ,  not  a  com- plete system  of  christian  doctrine.  Its  theme  is,  The  Gospel, the  power  of  God  -unto  aaVoation  to  Jew  and  Gentile  alike  ;  a power  because  of  its  revelation  of  a  righteous7tees  of  God  for believers.  In  the  development  of  this  theme  Paul  shows  that  Jew  and Gentile  are  alike  violators  of  divine  law,  and  are  consequently exposed  to  the  divine  wrath,  from  which  there  is  no  deliverance through  works  or  ordinances,  but  only  through  the  Gospel  of Jesus  Christ  accepted  by  faith.  In  insisting  upon  thi$  universal  condition  of  salvation,  God neither  violates  Ris  original  covenant  with  Israel,  nor  deprives Himself  of  the  right  to  judge  sin.  The  truth  of  justification  by  faith  is  an  Old-Testament  truth, illustrated  in  tlie  case  of  Abraham,  and  applicable  to  both  Jews and  Gentiles.     The  troe  seed  of  Abraham  are  those  who  fol-   J   INTRODUCTION.  XI  low  him,  not  in  circumcision  but  in  faith.  The  saving  provi- sion in  Christ  is  coextensive  with  the  results  of  the  fall  in Adam,  and  assures  present  and  future  salvation  to  its  subjects. The  office  of  the  law  was  to  develop  and  manifest  the  sin  which originated  in  Adam's  fall,  and  thus  to  give  full  scope  to  the  re* demptive  work  of  Christ.  This  truth  neither  encourages  immorality  nor  convicts  Ood of  unfaithfulness  to  His  covenant  with  IsraeL  Justification  bj faith  involves  personal  union  with  Christ,  and  consequent  death to  sin  and  moral  resurrection  to  newness  of  life.  Grace  does not  imply  liberty  to  sin,  but  a  change  of  masters  and  a  new obedience  and  service.  Grace  does  not  do  away  with  God's holy  law,  but  only  with  the  false  relation  of  the  natural  man  to that  law ;  in  which  sin  made  use  of  the  law  to  excite  man's opposition  to  it,  and  thus  to  bring  him  into  bondage  and  death. This  is  illustrated  from  Paul's  own  experience.  The  deliverance  from  this  bondage,  which  the  law  could  not effect,  is  wrought  by  the  law  of  the  Spirit  of  life  in  Christ Jesus,  which  frees  from  condemnation  and  initiates  a  life  of sonship  inspired  and  controlled  by  the  Spirit  of  Qod.  The power  of  this  life  appears  in  the  assurance  of  hope  which  it imparts  amid  the  trials  of  this  mortal  state,  a  hope  founded  in the  divine  election.  To  the  claim  that  Qod  cannot  reject  the  unbelieving  Jew without  breaking  His  own  covenant  and  stultifying  His  decree, is  opposed  the  doctrine  of  absolute  divine  sovereignty,  uncon- ditioned by  human  merit  or  service,  but  exercised  in  perfect righteousness  and  mercy,  which  are  vindicated  by  God's  forming for  Himself  a  people  of  believers,  both  Jew  and  Gentile.  It  is further  shown  that  this  divine  economy  includes  the  operation of  human  froe  agency  no  less  than  of  divine  sovereignty,  and that  the  rejection  of  Israel  was  therefore  due  to  their  blind reliance  on  their  original  election,  and  their  refusal  of  the  right- eousness which  is  through  faith  in  Christ.  This  rejection  is only  partial  and  temporary.  God  has  not  cast  off  His  people, but  has  overruled  their  unbelief  for  the  salvation  of  the  Gen- tiles, who,  in  turn,  shall  be  the  means  of  the  restoration  of  the Jews.     See  note  at  the  end  of  ch.  xi.   INTBODUCTIOS.  .A,.  The  practical  and  hortatory  portion  of  the  epistle,  which begins  with  eh,  xii.,  treats  of  the  cultivation  of  different  graces, civil  duties,  the  right  of  private  judgment,  and  the  doctrine  of christian  expediency  in  its  relations  to  weak  faith.  Critics  are  not  unanimoiis  as  to  the  integrity  of  the  epistle. The  authenticity  of  the  dojtology  has  been  questioned,  and  the Tiibingen  critics  declared  the  fifteenth  and  sixteenth  chapters to  be  spurious.  By  some,  the  greater  part  of  eh.  xvi.  is  sup- posed to  be  addressed  to  the  Ephesians.  See  on  ch.  xiv.  23  ; xvi.  25.  The  epistle  is  characterized  by  system,  masculine  vigor,  logic- al acuteneag,  copiougness  of  thought,  and  depth  of  feeling. Logic  is  backed  by  history,  and  christian  doctrine  and  precept are  iliumined  from  the  Prophets  and  Psalms.  Neither  personal feeling  nor  national  sentiment  is  allowed  to  turn  the  keen  edge of  truth.  The  opening  theme — all  alike  under  sin — is  evolved with  remorseless  sternness.  The  picture  of  tlie  moral  condition of  the  pagan  world  is  the  work  of  an  eye-witness,  and  is  terri- ble in  its  stark  realism.  Tet  the  logic  is  aglow  with  intense feeling,  which  rieea  st  times  toward  the  level  of  the  Ephesian epistle.  The  emotion  is  as  deep  as  in  Second  Corinthians,  but leas  turbulent.  The  irony  of  that  epietle  is  almost  wholly abeent.  The  opening  of  the  ninth  chapter  is  a  veritable  sob. The  perBonal  expressions  are  affectionate  and  laudatory,  but the  companion  and  friend  who  appears  in  First  Thessalonians, Philippians,  and  Philemon,  mostly  gives  place  to  the  apostle  and teacher.  The  powerful  dramatic  element  in  the  epistle  is  over- looked in  the  popular  impression  of  a  hard  theological  treatise. It  appears  in  the  forensic  moulds  in  which  the  great  spiritual processes  are  occasionally  cast ;  in  the  embodiment  of  the  an- tagonism of  sin  and  holiness  in  a  personal  struggle ;  in  the introduction  of  objections  as  by  an  interlocutor;  in  the  vivid contrasts  of  life  and  death,  spirit  and  flesh,  bondage  and  free- dom, condemnation  and  acquittal ;  in  the  impersonation  of  the whole  creation  groaning  and  travailing  for  deliverance  from  the bondage  of  corrnption.  Tlie  transitions  are  as  easy  and  natural  as  the  contrasts  are sharp.     The  nervous  but  steady  movement  of  cha.  ii.,  iii.,  iv.,   fe.   are  ■   INTRODUCnON.  xiii  suddenly  subsides  with  the  opening  of  ch.  v.,  and  one  can  pause and  bare  his  forehead  to  the  sweet  air  ere  he  begins  upon  the new  ascent  from  ver.  12.  The  first  words  of  the  eighth  chapter succeed  the  seventh  like  a  quiet  melody  given  out  by  flute  or horn  after  the  tumultuous  harmonies  of  the  ochestra ;  and  one is  conscious  of  no  shock  in  the  descent  from  the  high  themes  of sovereignty  and  grace  to  their  applications  in  common  life  and duty.     .  The  epistle  must  be  grasped  entire.  No  portion  of  the  New Testament  lends  itself  to  more  dangerous  distortions  of  truth through  fragmentary  use.  No  one  of  Paul's  epistles  is  so dependent  for  its  just  effect  upon  the  perception  of  the  relation of  its  parts  to  the  whole.  Its  logic  and  its  feeling  are  inseparable. It  answers  the  highest  test  of  eloquence  in  stimulating  emotion with  profound  thought,  and  in  fusing  thought  in  feeling.  But  to  acquire  such  a  grasp  is  no  easy  task,  especiaUy  for  the English  reader.  It  requires  far  more  than  close  grammatical analysis,  and  adjustment  of  the  special  theological  problems raised  by  the  epistle.  The  letter  must  be  studied  in  the  light of  the  whole  body  of  the  Pauline  writings,  and  with  the  largest possible  acquaintance  with  the  logical  and  rhetorical  habits of  the  apostle.  The  fulness  and  impetuosity  of  his  thought sometimes  render  him  careless  of  its  arrangement.  Sugges- tions, striking  into  the  main  line  of  reasoning,  are  pursued  with an  eagerness  and  to  a  length  which  may  easily  divert  the  reader from  the  principal  track.  Possible  qualifications  of  a  truth  are temporarily  neglected  in  the  concentration  of  thought  upon  a single  aspect.  It  is  not  always  easy  to  discover  where  the  mat- ter of  a  parenthesis  gives  place  to  the  resumption  of  the  main thought ;  sometimes  indeed  the  parenthesis  is  carried  on  as  if it  were  the  main  thought.  The  first  member  of  a  proposition often  acquires  a  headway  which  makes  him  forget  to  offset  it with  its  complementary  member.  His  antiUieses  are  not always  evenly  balanced,  and  one  member  may  be  literal  and  the other  metaphorical.  Certain  expressions  depend  for  their  force upon  word-plays  which  cannot  be  translated,  and  prepositions are  accumulated  with  reference  to  shades  of  meaning  which  tax the  utmost  resources  of  the  translator  and  commentator.   ISTRODUCnON.   THE   FIBBT   EFIBTLE  TO   THE   OOBINTHIAMS.  The  account  of  Paul's  first  visit  to  Corinth  ie  given  in  Acta xvii.  lie  continued  there  a  year  and  six  inonthe,  going  thetice to  Syria,  and  making  a  hrief  stay  on  bis  way  to  Jenisalem  at Epheans,  to  which  he  returned  and  remained  for  over  two years.  The  church  at  Corinth  became  the  moat  important  of those  founded  by  tlie  apostle,  and  probably  embraced  the church  at  the  adjoining  aeaport  of  Cencbreae  (see  on  Horn, xvi.  1),  and  the  Cbristiatia  scattered  throughout  Acbaia  (2  Cor. i.  1).  After  Paul's  departure  from  Corinth,  ApoUos,  commended by  the  Kpbeeian  cburcb,  waa  sent  to  labor  there.  Kotwitb- standing  his  e£&ciency  he  involuntarily  became  the  cause  of division  in  the  church,  as  the  nucleus  of  a  party  which  pre- ferred liis  polished  rhetoric  to  the  plainer  utterances  of  Paul (1  Cor.  iii.  4,  5).  Besides  this,  tbe  characteristic  sensuous  and  pleasure-loving tendencies  of  the  Corinthiana  began  to  assert  themselves  within the  church.  The  majority  of  the  converts  were  of  a  low  social grade,  many  of  thera  slaves,  and  the  seductions  of  the  gay  city often  proved  too  atrong  for  resistance.  Tbe  report  of  these  evils,  brought  to  Ephesus  by  Apollos  on hia  return  from  Corinth,  called  out  a  letter  from  Paul  which  is loat,  but  which  is  referred  to  in  1  Cor,  v.  9.  Additional  tidings came  in  a  letter  from  tlie  church  to  Paul,  aaking  advice  on  tlie following  points:  1.  Celibacy  and  marriage.  Was  married life  a  lower  condition  than  celibacy,  or  was  it  wrong  in  itself  ? Were  marriages  allowable  between  Christians  and  heathen  ? Bhould  a  Christian  wife  or  husband  abandon  a  lieathen  spouae  ? 2,  MeaiB  offered  to  idols.  Idol  sacrifices  were  festivals.  Gen- tile converts  refused  to  abandon  the  society  of  their  heathen friends,  and  mingled  with  them  at  the  idol  feasts ;  while  a  meal at  a  public  festival  was  a  aubatantial  help  to  the  poor.  Might Christiana  attend  these  festivals?  Might  they  buy  in  the  mar- ket the  resold  meat  which  had  been  offered  to  idols  ?  3.  StUea in  astembUea.     Should  men  cover  their  heads  \\     Should  women   J   INTRODOCnON.  XV  appear  uncovered  ?  Might  women  speak  and  teach  in  public } 4.  SpirtttuU  gifts.  Which  was  the  more  important,  speaking with  tongnes  or  preaching  ?  What  should  be  done  when  sev- eral began  to  speak  at  once  ?  5.  77ie  resurrection.  Some maintained  that  it  was  purely  spiritual  and  that  it  was  already past.  6.  They  also  desired  to  hear  something  more  about  the collection  for  the  poor  in  Judaea,  and  to  have  Apollos  sent back.  The  bearers  of  the  letter,  Stephanas,  Fortunatus,  and  Achai- cus,  together  with  those  of  the  household  of  Chloe  (1  Cor.  i. 11),  also  brought  tidings  of  the  factions  which  had  divided  the church  and  the  quarrels  over  the  different  preachers.  Certain Judaic  teachers  had  come,  with  commendatory  letters  from Jerusalem,  claiming  the  authority  of  Peter  and  impugning  that of  Paul,  declaring  that  Peter  was  the  true  head  of  the  Christian Church  and  Paul  an  interloper.  A  fourth  distinct  party  is supposed  by  some  to  be  indicated  by  the  words  ^^  I  of  Christ \" (see  on  1  Cor.  L  10).  It  also  appeared  that  the  assemblies  of the  church  had  become  disorderly;  that  the  agapae  and  the eucharist  were  scenes  of  gluttony,  brawling,  and  drunk- enness; while  the  gatherings  for  worship  were  thrown  into confusion  by  the  simultaneous  speaking  of  those  who  professed the  gift  of  tongues.  Women  were  speaking  unveiled  in  these assemblies.  One  prominent  church-member  was  living  crim- inally with  his  stepmother.  On  the  receipt  of  this  letter  Paul  abandoned  his  intended visit  to  Corinth,  sent  Titus  to  inform  the  church  of  his  change of  plan  and  to  arrange  for  the  collection,  and  dictated  to  Sos- thenes  the  first  epistle  to  the  Corinthians.  Notwithstanding the  subscription  of  the  letter,  \"  written  from  Philippi,\"  a  mis- take which  grew  out  of  1  Cor.  xvi.  5,  it  was  written  at  Ephesus, as  appears  from  1  Cor.  xvi  8, 19.  He  begins  by  stating  his  complaints  against  the  church (i.  10-vi.  20).  He  then  answers  the  questions  contained  in their  letter :  Marriage  (vii,  1-40) ;  Sacrificial  feasts  (viii.  1-13). From  this  he  diverges  to  the  insinuations  against  his  character and  authority,  noticing  the  charge  based  upon  his  refnsal  to receive  pecuniary  support,  and  asserting  his  unselfish  devo-   XTl  INTRODUCTION.  tion  to  the  Go6pel  (ix.).  lie  returns  to  the  sftcrificial  feaets (x.).  Then  he  p^ees  to  the  regulation  of  the  assemblies  (xi.). The  difFereot  epiritu&l  gifts  and  their  mutual  relation  are  dis- cussed in  ch.  xii.,  and  Love  is  shown  to  be  greater  and  more euduring  than  all  gifts  (xiii.).  The  subject  of  speaking  witli tongues  is  tlieii  taken  up,  and  the  superiority  of  prophecy  to the  gift  of  tongues  is  asserted  (xiv.  1-40).  Ch.  xv.  discusGes the  resurrection,  and  the  epistle  concludes  with  references  to  cer- tain personal  and  incidental  matters,  including  the  collection.  Authorities  are  generally  agreed  in  placing  the  date  of  the epiatle  a.d.  57.     Its  authenticity  is  conceded  on  all  hands.  The  key-note  of  the  epistle  is  struck  in  two  correlated thoughts — the  supreme  headship  of  Christ,  and  the  union  of believers  as  one  body  in  and  with  Him,  Tlie  former  thought finds  expression  in  Paul's  humble  disclaimer  of  all  merely  per- sonal authority,  and  of  all  right  to  a  hearing  save  as  Christ's ggeut  and  mouthpiece.  The  power  of  preaching  resides  in  its theme — Christ  crucified — and  not  in  its  philosophic  wisdom nor  in  the  personal  culture  of  its  preachers.  The  gifts  and graces  of  the  Church  are  due  to  Christ  alone.  The  other thought  is  the  standing  confutation  and  rebuke  of  all  the  errors and  abuses  which  liave  invaded  the  Church.  Faction,  fornica- tion, litigation,  fellowship  with  idolaters — all  are  sufBciently condemned  by  the  fact  that  they  break  the  sacred  tie  between the  Church  and  Christ,  and  between  individuals  and  the Church,  Union  in  Christ  implies  divine  order  in  the  Church, The  sexes  fall  into  their  true  relation.  The  subordinations  of the  heavenly  hierarchies  are  perpetuated  in  the  Church.  Con- fusion is  banished  from  public  worship,  and  the  mystery  of  the eucharist  is  expounded  in  the  mutual  love  and  helpfulness  of the  participants.  Diversities  of  spiritual  gifts  are  harmonized and  utilized  through  their  relation  to  the  one  body  and  the informing  power  of  one  divine  Spirit — the  Spirit  of  love. Christian  expediency,  involving  individual  sacrifice  for  the  com- mon welfare,  becomes  an  authoritative  principle.  This  unity finds  its  crowning  exhibition  in  the  resurrection,  in  which  be- lievers share  the  resurrection  of  their  Lord,  and  enter  into  final and  perfect  communion  with  His  glorified  life.   t   INTRODUCTION.  xvii  It  has  been  tmthfally  said  that  no  portion  of  the  11  ew  Test- ament discusses  so  directly  the  moral  problems  of  that  age  or of  our  own.  Many  of  the  same  questions  emerge  in  the  social and  church-life  of  modem  times.  Such  are  the  rally  of  cliques round  popular  preachers;  the  antithesis  of  asceticism  and christian  liberty ;  of  christian  zeal  and  christian  wisdom ;  the true  relation  of  the  sexes  and  the  proper  position  and  function of  woman  in  the  Church  ;  the  assertion  of  individual  inspiration against  the  canons  of  christian  decency;  the  antagonism  be- tween individualism  and  the  subordination  of  the  members  to the  body;  the  resurrection  in  the  light  of  modem  science; aestheticism  and  morals.  No  epistle  of  the  New  Testament,  therefore,  should  be  more carefully  studied  by  the  modem  pastor.  THB  SBOOND  BPI8TLB  TO  THB  OOKINTHIANB.  Paul's  stay  at  Ephesus  was  cut  short  by  the  riot  He  de- parted to  Troas,  and  thence  to  Macedonia  (Acts  xx.),  where  he met  Titus,  for  whose  arrival  he  had  anxiously  waited  in  order to  leam  the  effect  of  his  letter  (2  Cor.  i.  8 ;  ii.  13 ;  vii.  6). Titus'  report  was  both  gratifying  and  disheartening.  Be  had been  cordially  received,  and  the  epistle  had  caused  penitence and  amendment ;  but  the  influence  of  the  anti-Pauline  parties had  increased,  and  they  were  openly  assailing  Paul's  character and  insisting  on  their  own  superior  apostolic  claims.  Accord- ingly Titus  was  again  sent  to  Corinth  with  a  second  epistle, written  from  some  point  in  Macedonia.  The  statement  of  the sabscription  that  it  was  written  from  Philippi,  lacks  evidence, besides  being  in  itself  improbable.  The  date  is  the  autumn  of AJD.  57.  The  epistle  is  among  the  least  systematic  of  Paul's  writings, for  the  reason  that  it  was  written  in  a  conflict  of  feeling,  in which  joy,  grief,  and  indignation  straggled  for  the  mastery. Its  main  motives  are  three  in  number.  1.  Thankfulness  for the  effect  of  his  first  letter.  2.  Indignation  at  the  work  and increasing  influence  of  the  false  teachers.  3.  Anxiety  for  the completion  of  the  collection,  and  that  the  Corinthians  should   XTllT  INTRODUCTION.  imitate  the  good  example  of  the  Macedonian  cbnrches.  \"  Tlie tliree  objects  of  tLe  epistle  are,  in  point  of  arrangement,  kupt distinct ;  but  eo  velieraent  were  tiie  feelings  under  whicli  he wrote,  that  the  thankful  expreBsion  of  the  first  part  ia  darkened by  the  indignation  of  the  third  ;  and  the  directions  about  the business  of  the  contribution  are  colored  by  tlie  reflections  botli of  his  joy  and  of  his  grief  \"  (Stanley).  The  style  accords  with  tliis  turbulence  of  feeling.  It  ie  sur- charged with  passionate  emotion.  No  one  of  Paul's  epistles  in BO  intensely  personal.  Hero  only  he  reveals  two  of  those  great spiritual  e.fperiences  which  belong  to  a  Christian's  inmost heart-life — persona!  crises  which  are  secrets  between  a  man and  his  God.  One  of  these — the  thorn  in  the  flesh — is  a  crisis of  agony ;  the  other — the  rapture  into  the  third  heaven — a  crisis of  ecstasy.  Bengel's  remark  is  familiar,  that  the  epistle  is  an itinerary.  \"  The  very  stages  of  his  journey  are  impressed  upon it ;  the  troubles  at  Ephesus,  the  repose  at  Troas,  the  anxieties and  consolations  of  Macedonia,  the  prospect  of  removing  to Corinth  \"  (Stanley).  His  self -vindication  is  not  only  a  remark- able piece  of  personal  history,  bnt  a  revelation  of  his  high  sense of  honor  and  his  keen  eensitiveness,  llis  \"  boasting,\"  into which  he  is  driven  by  persistent  alander,  throws  into  relief  his aversion  to  self-praise.  lie  formally  announces  his  intention to  boast,  as  though  he  can  bring  himself  to  the  task  only  by committing  himself  to  it.  Thrice  he  repeats  the  annonncement, and  each  time  seems  to  catch,  with  a  sense  of  relief,  at  an  oppor- tunity for  digressing  to  a  different  subject.  Ecstatic  thanks- giving and  cutting  irony,  self-assertion  and  self-abnegation, commendation,  warning  and  authority,  paradox,  apology,  all meet  and  cross  and  seethe ;  yet  out  of  the  swirling  eddies  rise, like  rocks,  grand  Christian  principles  and  inspiring  hopes. Such  are  the  double  power  of  the  Gospel  for  life  or  death  ;  the freedom  and  energy  of  the  dispensation  of  the  Spirit ;  suffering the  path  to  glory ;  the  divine  purpose  in  the  decay  of  the  fleshly tabernacle ;  the  new  and  heavenly  investment  of  the  mortal Hfe;  the  universal  judgment ;  the  nature  of  repentance  as  dis- tinguished from  sorrow,  and  the  principles  of  christian  liberal- ity.    Fnll  and  swift  as  is  the  torrent,  there  is  ever  a  hand  on   INTRODUCnON.  XIX  the  floodgate.  In  the  most  indignant  ontborst  the  sense  of suppression  asserts  itself.  Indignation  and  irony  never  run into  malediction.  We  cease  to  be  surprised  at  the  apostle's capability  of  indignation  when  we  catch  glimpses,  as  we  do throughout  the  epistle,  into  the  depths  of  his  tenderness.  It  is  not  strange  that  sach  a  tempest  should  set  its  mark  upon the  style  and  diction,  especially  if  we  assume  that  the  epistle  was dictated  to  an  amanuensis.  In  some  particulars  the  epistle  is  the most  difficult  in  the  New  Testament.  The  style  is  broken,  in- volved, at  times  obscure.  The  impetuosity  of  the  thought  car- ries it  from  point  to  point  with  a  rapidity  which  makes  it  often hard  to  grasp  the  sequence  and  connection.  It  is  preeminently picturesque,  abounding  in  metaphors  which  sometimes  lie  un- developed in  the  heart  of  single  words,  and  sometimes  are strangely  mixed  or  suddenly  shifted.  Building  and  clothing blend  in  describing  the  heavenly  investiture  of  the  believer ; now  the  Corinthians  are  a  commendatory  letter  written  in  the apostles'  hearts,  now  the  letter  is  written  by  Christ  on  the  Co- rinthians' hearts ;  the  rush  of  thought  does  not  stop  at  the  in- congruity of  an  epistle  on  stone  and  of  ink  on  stone  tables ; now  the  knowledge  of  Christ,  now  the  apostles  themselves  are a  sweet  odor.  Paul  does  not  huckster  the  word  of  God.  He does  not  ienumb  his  converts  like  a  toi*pedo.  Here  a  word  calls up  Gideon's  lamps  and  pitchers,  there  the  rocky  strongholds  of the  Cilician  pirates.  A  rapid  series  of  participles  carries  us through  the  successive  stages  of  a  battle — the  hemming  in,  the cutting  the  way  out,  the  pursuit,  the  blow  of  the  enemy's sword.  The  high  citadel  is  stormed,  the  lofty  towers  are  over- thrown, the  captives  are  led  away.  Paul  bears  about  a  daily death :  affliction  is  a  light  weight,  glory  an  overwhelming  bur- den :  the  fleshly  body  is  a  tent,  the  glorifled  body  an  eternal building,  or  a  garment  dropped  from  above.  Certain  words  appear  to  have  a  peculiar  fascination  for  the writer,  as  if  they  gathered  up  into  themselves  the  signiflcance  of whole  masses  of  thought  Without  arresting  its  main  current, the  stream  eddies  round  these.  Sometimes  he  dwells  on  them caressingly,  as  \"  the  Qod  of  all  comfort^  who  comforteth  us,  that we  may  be  able  to  comfort  with  the  comfort  wherewith  we  are   XI  INTRODUCTION.  oonifofied\"  Sometimes  he  ringe  them  out  like  a  challenge,  aa contmend,  eomfnsjidatuyn,  boast.  Sometimes  lie  touches  and  re- touches them  with  a  sarcastic  emphasis,  as  bear  with  me,  bear witii  them.  \"  So  full  of  turns  is  he  everywhere,\"  saj-s  Eraeiims, \"  fio  great  is  the  skill,  you  would  nut  believe  that  the  eanie  man was  speaking.  Now,  as  some  limpid  fountain,  he  gently  bubbles forth;  anon,  like  a  mighty  torrent,  he  rolls  crashing  on,  whirl- ing many  things  aloug  in  his  course :  again  he  flows  calmly  and Bmoothly,  or  spreads  out  into  a  lake.\"  The  authenticity  of  the  epistle  is  conceded.  Unsuccessful attempts  have  been  made  against  its  integrity,  aa  the  eSort  to ihow  that  it  coDfiietfl  of  three  separate  epistles,  or  of  two.   THE    EPISTLES    OF    THE    IMPRISONMENT.  This  name  is  given  to  the  Epistles  to  the  Philippiana,  Ephes- ians,  Golossians,  and  Philemon,  because  they  were  composed during  Paul's  first  imprisonment  at  Rome.  By  a  few  critics they  have  been  assigned  to  the  period  of  the  confinement  at   '   Paul  arrived  in  Rome,  under  guard,  after  his  shipwreck  at Malta,  in  March,  a.d.  61,  in  the  seventh  year  of  the  reigu  of  Nero. He  was  placed  in  charge  of  the  Praetorian  Guard,  the  mem- bei-B  of  which  relieved  each  other  in  his  custody,  each  soldier being  chained  to  his  hand.  This  interruption  of  liis  missionary labors  was  a  blessing  in  disguise.  Twenty  years  of  exh.iusting toil  had  brought  the  necessity  for  rest  and  meditation.  The two  years  of  confiuemeut  in  Caesarea  afforded  the  apostle  the leisure  for  sinking  his  thought  deeper  into  the  mystery  of  the Gospel.  The  effect  is  apparent  in  the  epistles  from  his  Roman prison.  Nothing  in  these,  indeed,  contradicts  his  previous  writ- ings; the  fundamental  tliemcs  of  the  earlier  epistles  recnr,  and Philippians  in  particular  exhibits  marked  parallels  with  Ro- mans. In  all  Christ  is  central.  In  Romans  and  in  the  Corin- thian epistles  there  are  not  wanting  instances  of  the  exalted feeling  which  is  so  marked  in  Ephesians,  Colossians,  and  Phi-   J   INTRODUCTION.  XXi  lippiana.  The  Jndaizing  iDaolence,  castigated  in  Gralatians,  is sharply  toached  again  in  Philippians.  The  relations  of  Jew and  Gentile  reappear  in  Ephesians ;  and  Christ's  headship  of the  Chnrch,  assumed  in  First  Corinthians,  is  developed  and  em- phasized in  Ephesians  and  Colossians.  Nevertheless,  the  Epistles  of  the  Imprisonment  carry  us  into a  new  atmosphere.  The  thought  takes  new  directions  and  a wider  range.  The  apostle's  personality  appears  in  an  aspect which  it  is  not  easy  to  analyze,  but  which  carries  with  it  the sense  of  a  broadening  and  deepening  of  the  whole  man.  In the  discussion  of  christian  truth  the  points  of  emphasis  are shifted.  In  the  earlier  epistles  he  deals  largely  with  unbeliev- ers, in  the  latter  with  Christians.  In  the  one  he  is  aiming  to initiate  union  with  Christ ;  in  the  other  to  develop  communion. In  the  one  he  points  to  the  cross,  in  the  other  from  the  cross  to the  inheritance  of  grace  and  glory  which  it  commands.  In  the one  he  emphasizes  Christ  crucified,  in  the  other  Christ  risen, ascended,  and  reigning.  In  all  alike  the  cross  is  central,  but  in these  latter  epistles  it  is  coordinated  with  the  vast  economy  of creation,  redemption,  the  Church  on  earth  and  in  heaven,  as  it lies  entire  in  the  eternal  counsels  of  God.  Here  the  person rather  than  the  work  of  Christ  is  in  the  foreground :  here,  for the  first  time  in  the  Pauline  writings,  the  eye  is  distinctly  fixed upon  the  pre-iucamate  Son  of  God.  While  in  the  earlier  groups of  epistles  the  moral  applications  of  doctrine  are  not  overlooked, in  these,  the  ethical  element  is  more  evenly  balanced  with  the theological.  In  Philippians  the  ethical  element  dominates  the theological.  The  great  christological  truths  are  translated  into christian  experience,  and  brought  to  bear  as  the  principles  and motives  of  duty.  ^^  No  duty  is  too  small  to  illustrate  one  or other  of  the  principles  which  inspired  the  divinest  acts  of Christ.  The  commonest  acts  of  humility  and  beneficence  are to  be  imitations  of  the  condescension  which  brought  Him  from the  position  of  equality  with  God  to  the  obedience  of  the  cross ; and  the  ruling  motive  of  the  love  and  kindness  practised  by Christians  to  one  another  is  to  be  the  recollection  of  their  com- mon connection  with  Him.'*  *  *  StaUcer.   Xxii  1NTBOD0CTION.  A  difference  from  tlie  earlier  epiBtlea  also  develops  throiigli tlie  new  pbaee  of  error  with  wliicii  tlie  apoBtle  has  to  de:il. Epaphraa  announced  the  apjiearauee  of  a  new  enemy  in  the churchee  of  the  Lycus.  The  point  of  assanlt  had  begun  to  shift from  legalism  to  philosophic  niyBticiein,  LegaliBm  itself  be- trayed the  infusion  of  Essenic  asceticism  and  Gnostic  specula- tiveness.  These  were  the  forces  which  brought  to  the  front  the doctrines  of  Christ's  person  and  of  the  Church ;  the  one  as  the bulwark  against  the  fancy  of  mediate  creation  and  the  affected humility  of  angel- worship,  and  the  other,  in  its  exhibition  of Christ  as  the  head  of  the  body  of  believers,  contesting  the claim  of  philosophy  to  be  the  euprcnie  source  of  wisdom,  and the  right  of  legal  ordinances  to  give  the  law  to  life.   For  Philippi,  see  on  Philip.  !.  1.  With  the  arrival  of  Paul  at  Philippi  (Acts  svi.),  the  Gospel entered  Europe.  On  Iiis  departure  he  left  Luke  to  complete the  organization  of  the  Chnrch.  He  subsequently  visited  the city  twice,  after  which  we  hear  nothing  of  the  Philippian church  until  be  writes  to  it  from  bis  Roman  prison.  On  hear- ing of  his  transfer  to  Rome,  the  Philippians,  with  the  same generosity  which  they  had  shown  on  former  occasions  (Philip, iv.  15,  16  ;  2  Cor.  xi.  8,  9),  sent  a  supply  of  money  by  Epaph- roditus,  who,  on  his  return,  brought  this  letter.  The  epistle  is  unofficial  and  familiar  in  character,  even  the spoEtolic  title  being  dropped  in  the  opening  salutation.  In  its unsystematic  strnclnre  it  rivals  Second  Corinthians.  It  opens with  an  account  of  the  progress  of  the  Gospel  in  Kome  since his  arrival,  the  efforts  of  his  opposers,  and  the  zeal  of  hie friends,  and  an  expression  of  his  own  feelings  as  to  his  pos- sible death  or  continued  life.  An  exhortation  follows  to  christ- ian unity,  courage,  and  humility,  the  latter  illustrated  by  the great  act  of  Christ's  humiliation.  He  hopes  soon  to  be  re- leased :  he  is  about  to  send  Timothy  to  Philippi ;  Epaphrodi- tus  has  been  sick,  and  is  about  to  retni-n  home.  Let  them beware  of  the  Judaizere — the  doge,  the  concision.     Their  arro-   INTRODUCTION.  xxiii  gant  claims  are  contrasted  with  the  rights  and  privileges  of Christians,  and  the  contrast  is  pointed  bj  his  own  spiritual history  and  a  recital  of  the  legal  privileges  which  he  relin- qnished  for  Christ.  Then  follow  an  exhortation  to  steadfast- ness, a  lament  over  the  victims  of  sensuality,  and  a  contrast of  such  with  those  whose  life  and  hope  are  heavenly.  Two prominent  ladies  are  entreated  to  reconcile  their  differences, after  which  come  some  parting  admonitions  to  entertain  pure thoughts  and  high  aims,  and  a  grateful  acknowledgment  of  the gift  brought  by  Epaphroditus.  In  the  tone  of  strong  personal  attachment  which  pervades the  epistle,  it  resembles  the  first  to  the  Thessalonians.  It  con- tains no  formulated  doctrinal  teaching,  and  no  indication  of the  presence  of  doctrinal  errors  within  the  Church.  Only  the severe  allusions  in  the  third  chapter,  to  Judaizers  and  Antino- mian  loose-livers,  have  the  flavor  of  controversy,  and  the  treat- ment of  these  is  not  argumentative,  but  denunciatory,  hortative, and  expostulatory.  The  only  warning  to  the  Church  is  against internal  dissensions.  Christ  is  set  forth,  not  in  His  relation  to great  christian  mysteries,  but  as  a  living  power  in  personal experience — notably  in  the  apostle's  own.  The  words  and  imagery  reveal  occasional  traces  of  the  con- tact of  Stoicism,  as  citizenship  (i.  28 ;  iii.  20) ;  content^  or  self' sufficient  (iv.  2) ;  and  the  passage,  i,  21-27,  presents  a  vivid contrast  with  the  Stoic's  theory  of  life  and  his  justification  of suicide.  The  epistle  abounds  in  picturesque  words,  as  earnest expectation  (i.  20);  terrified  (i.  28);  depaH  (L  23);  robbery (ii.  6) ;  holding  forth  (ii.  16) ;  offered  (ii.  17) ;  not  regarding (ii.  30) ;  keep  (iv.  7) ;  learned  (iv.  11),  etc.     See  notes.  Bishop  Lightfoot  observes :  ^^  The  Epistle  to  the  Philippians is  not  only  the  noblest  reflection  of  Paul's  personal  character and  spiritual  illumination,  his  large  sympathies,  his  womanly tenderness,  his  delicate  courtesy,  his  frank  independence,  his entire  devotion  to  the  Master's  service — ^but  as  a  monument  of the  power  of  the  Gospel  it  yields  in  importance  to  none  of  the apostolic  writings.  ...  To  all  ages  of  the  Church — to  our own  especially — this  epistle  reads  a  great  lesson.  While  we  are expendying  our  strength  on  theological  definitions  or  ecclesias-   xxiv  INTRODUCTION.  tical  I'ulee,  it  recalls  ns  from  these  distractioDs  to  the  very  liearE and  centre  of  the  Gospel — the  ]ife  of  Chrifit  and  the  life  in Christ.  Here  is  tlie  meeting-point  of  all  our  differences,  the healing  of  all  our  feuds,  the  true  life  alike  of  individuals  and Becta  and  churches;  here  doctrine  and  practice  are  wedded  to- gether ;  for  here  is  the  '  creed  of  creeds '  involved  in  and  arising out  of  the  '  work  of  works.'  \"  The  authenticity  and  genuineness  are  generally  conceded, though  violently  assailed  by  the  Tubingen  critics.  The  date  of composition  is  probably  about  il.d.  62,  and  the  epistle  is,  I  thinks to  be  placed  in  order  before  the  other  three.*   THK   EPISTLE   TO   THE   EFHEBIANB.   L   For  Ephesos,  see  on  Apoc.  ii.  1.  The  church  in  Ephesua  was  founded  during  Paul's  long  reei- denee  there  (Acta  xix.  10 ;  xx.  31j.  He  left  the  city  unnjedi- ately  after  the  great  riot  (Acts  six.),  and  never  returned.  Hia last  personal  coutaut  with  the  church  was  when  he  met  its eldei-s  at  Miletus  (Acts  xx.  IS,  35).  There  has  been  much  discussion  aa  to  the  destination  of  the epistle.  The  principal  views  are  three;  1.  That  it  was  ad- dressed to  the  church  at  Ephesus.  2.  To  the  church  at  Laodi- caoa.  3.  That  it  was  an  encyclical  or  circular  epistle,  intended for  the  church  at  Ephesus  along  with  a  body  of  neighboring churches.  Some  also  have  regarded  it  aa  designed  for  the churches  of  Ephesus  and  Laodieaea,  and  others  for  the  Lao- dicaean  church  along  with  a  circle  of  churches.  I  regard  the  epistle  as  addressed  to  the  Churcli  at  Ephesut;. Such  was  the  general  opinion  of  the  early  church.  The  words \"  in  Ephesus\"  (i.  1),  though  omitted  in  two  important  manu- Bcripts,  are  found  in  the  majority  of  manuscripts  and  in  all  the old  versions.  The  Laodicaean  theory  f  was  started  bj-  Mai-cion, who  was  severely  taken  to  task  by  Tertullian  for  altering  the title  to  \"  the  Epistle  to  the  Laodicaeans.\"     Marcion  himself  in-  *  Agftinst  ths  lUkjorltT  of  anthorltlM. f  Advooated  bj  BUhop  LIghtfoot  ",

Bnt  when  ad- dressing a  circle  of  churches,  Paul  is  wont  to  specify  the  fact, as  in  First  and  Second  Corinthians  and  Galatians.  If  the  words ^^  in  Ephesus  \"  be  rejected,  the  epistle  is  entirely  without  local designation,  and  is  catholic  rather  than  encyclical.  Moreover, whenever  Paul,  in  the  address  of  an  epistle,  uses  roU  oiatv which  are^  he  follows  these  with  the  name  of  a  place,  as  *'  at Rome,''  \"  at  Philippi,\"  «  at  Corinth.\"  The  Ephesian  church,  so  far  as  is  indicated  by  the  letter, furnished  no  special  reason  for  its  composition.  It  contains  no references  to  the  dangers  which  Paul  predicted  at  Miletus,  no allusions  to  his  personal  relations  with  the  church,  and  no  salu- tations to  individuals.  Its  theme  is  the  Church  of  Christy founded  in  the  will  of  the  Father^  developed  hy  the  work  of  the Sany  and  united  in  him  ihrovgh  the  indwelling  and  energy  of the  Holy  Spirit,  The  body  of  believers  is  chosen  of  God :  their  privilege  is adoption :  the  motive  of  adoption  is  grace,  its  medium  Jesus Christ,  its  element  love,  its  end  holiness  and  the  glorification  of divine  grace  (i.  3-6).  The  work  of  the  Son  in  this  scheme  is  redemption,  remission of  sins,  and  the  gift  of  wisdom  and  discernment  His  central position  in  the  divine  plan  will  appear  in  the  consummation, which  will  consist  in  the  summing  up  of  all  things  in  Him  (i. 7-12).  The  agent  and  earnest  of  this  inheritance  of  believers  is  the Holy  Spirit  (i.  13-14).  Hence  the  prayer  that  the  operation  of  the  Spirit  may  appear in  the  bestowment  of  wisdom  and  revelation  (compare  i.  8),  and of  quickened  spiritual  discernment ;  so  that  believers  may recognize  the  divine  call,  and  experience  the  hope  which  it  en- genders, the  riches  of  the  inheritance  which  it  assures  (compare i.  11),  and  the  efficiency  of  the  divine  power  which  is  exhibited   JXVl  INTRODUCTION.  aod  pledged  to  them  in  tbe  resurrection  and  exaltation  of Christ  (i.  15-22).  The  election,  the  call,  the  redemptive  work,  the  adoption, the  personal  holiiiegs,  the  knowledge  and  diBcernment—all  find their  embodiment  in  the  Church,  the  body  of  Christ,  in  which the  divine  fnlneBS  dwells  (i.  22,  23).  Tbe  scope  of  this  plan  is  universal,  inclnding  both  Jews  and Gentiles.  Its  operation  ia  illustrated  in  the  turning  of  tbe Gentiles  from  their  sins,  and  in  the  destnictiou  of  tbe  national and  religious  barriers  between  them  and  the  Jews,  making  of the  two  one  Church  in  Christ,  the  dwelling- place  of  the  Spirit, built  on  the  foundation  of  the  apostles  and  prophets,  with Christ  as  the  corner-stone  {ii.  1-22).  The  inclusion  of  the  Gentiles  in  the  divine  covenant  ia  a mjstery  of  which  Paul  lias  been  made  the  minister.  The intent  of  this  mystery  is  to  manifest  through  the  Church  to  the heavenly  powers  the  manifold  wisdom  of  God  (iii.  2-10),  Thus  far  the  theme,  the  Church,  is  struck  at  i.  22,  23;  it 19-22 ;  iii.  10.  The  prayer  (iii.  14-21)  includes  the  points  already  touched — the  universal  fatherhood  of  God;  the  sonship  of  Christ;  the work  of  the  Spirit  in  believers;  the  indwelling  of  Christ  by faith  ;  love  as  tiie  element  of  christian  life  ;  knowledge  of  the deep  things  of  God — and  returns  to  the  main  theme,  tbe Church.  The  key-note  of  the  practical  portion  of  the  epistle  is  given in  eh.  iv.  1 :  \"  Walk  wortliy  of  your  calling.\"  Tbe  practical exhortations  contemplate  individuals  in  their  relation  to  the Church.  The  fundamental  duty  is  unily  through  the  one  in- formiug  Spirit  (iv.  3,  4).  The  great  factors  of  chui-ch  feliow- ehip  are  specified  :  \"  One  Lord  \"  (Christ) ;  one  principle  of \"  faith,\"  uniting  to  Christ ;  one  formal  sign,  \"  baptism,\"  mark- ing admission  to  the  body  of  Christ ;  one  universal  \"  Father,\" ruling,  pervading,  and  dwelling  in  all  (iv.  5,  d).  Tliis  unity  of  the  Church  includes  and  is  furthered  by  various manifeetationa  of  the  Spirit  in  the  form  of  different  gifts ;  and the  authority  of  Christ  to  confer  and  distribute  these  gifts is  indicated  by  His  descent  to  earth  and  Hades,  and  His  ascent   J   iNTRODucnoir.  xxvii  to  the  glory  of  the  Father  (iv.  7-16).  In  the  thought  that  tne purpose  of  these  gifts  is  the  edifying  of  the  body  of  Christ,  the theme — the  Church — is  again  sounded.  Practical  exhortations  follow,  to  spiritual  renewal,  truthful- ness, peace,  honesty,  purity  of  speech  and  life,  love,  godly caution,  temperance,  holy  meditation  and  christian  interchange, gratitude,  and  the  reciprocal  duties  of  husband  and  wife,  in which  last  the  church-theme  is  once  more  enunciated  in  typ- ifying by  the  marriage-rite  Christ's  love  for  the  Church (iv.  7-v.).  The  Church  includes  the  household.  The  exhortations  to fidelity  in  household  relations  are  continued  (vi.  1-9).  The ideal  of  the  Church  and  of  individual  character  is  realized  only through  conflict  with  the  evil  world  and  the  powers  of  dark- ness, in  which  the  power  of  God  alone  can  insure  victory. Hence  the  Christian  is  urged  to  clothe  himself  with  the  divine panoply  (vi.  10-18).  The  authenticity  of  the  epistle  has  been  challenged  on  the ground  of  dissimilarity  to  the  other  writings  of  Paul,  unusual words  and  phrases,  and  a  general  un-Pauline  character  in  doc- trine and  diction.  As  regards  doctrine,  the  charge  is  beneath notice.  As  to  diction,  the  argument  from  unusual  expressions would  bear  equally  against  the  genuineness  of  some  of  the  best- attested  epistles.  While  there  are  forty-two  unique  words  in this  letter,  there  are  thirty-eight  in  Colossians,  above  a  hundred in  Romans,  and  two  hundred  and  thirty  in  First  Corinthians ; while  the  well-known  peculiarities  of  Paul's  style  are  as  evident in  this  as  in  the  other  epistles.  The  epistle  has  also  been  assailed  as  '^  a  mere  verbose  expan- sion \"  of  the  Colossian  letter.  There  are,  indeed,  marked  resem- blances between  the  two  both  in  matter  and  form,  and  some- times literal  correspondences,  as  might  be  expected  in  two  epis- tles written  about  the  same  time ;  but  both  the  subject  and  the treatment  of  the  two  epistles  present  too  many  differences  to bear  out  this  charge  of  amplification.  On  the  contrary,  the same  subject  is  sometimes  treated  more  concisely  in  Ephesians than  in  Colossians  (Eph.  i.  16-17 ;  Col.  i.  3-6 ;  Eph.  iv.  32 ; Col.  iii.  12-14).     Ephesians,  moreover,  contains  matter   not   XXviii  INTRODUCTION.  found  in  CoIosBians  (Epli.  i.  13-14;  iv.  8-15;  v.  7-14,  23-31 ; vi.  10-17).  The  polemic  element  in  Coloseiane  ia  wanting  in  Ephesians. The  Chriatologjof  ColoBsiana  is  more  metaphysical  than  that of  Epheeiane,  while  the  predeetinarianiBm  of  Ephesians  does not  appear  in  Cotoasians.  This  epistle  presents  peculiar  difficulties  to  the  student. Dean  Alford  says  :  \"  Tiie  difficulties  lie  altogetlier  beneath  tlie surface ;  are  not  discernible  by  the  cursory  reader,  wlio  liuda all  very  atraight forward  and  simple.  .  ,  .  But  wiien  we begin  to  inquire  why  thought  succeeds  to  thought,  and  one cumbrous  parenthesis  to  another — depths  under  depths  disclose themselTes,  wonderful  syatetns  of  parallel  alhiaton,  frequent  and complicated  underplots — every  word,  the  more  we  search,  ap- provea  itself  as  set  in  its  esact  logical  place;  ws  see  every phrase  contributing  by  its  own  similar  organization  and  articu- lation to  the  carrying  out  of  the  organic  whole.  But  this  result IB  not  won  without  much  labor  of  tliougJit,  without  repeated uid  minute  laying  together  of  portions  and  expressions,  with- out bestowing  on  single  words  and  plirases,  and  their  aucceasion tad  aiTangeraent,  as  much  atudy  aa  would  suffice  for  whole  sec- tioDS  of  more  exoteric  epistles.\"  While  the  diction  is  marked  by  a  peculiar  sonorousness  and depth  of  tone,  it  does  not  surpass  in  variety  and  picturesqueness that  of  some  other  epistles.  Second  Corinthiana,  for  instance. The  shorter  epiatle  to  the  Colossians  contains  thirty-eight unique  words  to  forty-two  in  Epheaiaiia.  But  no  writing  of Paul  equala  this  in  the  liturgical  majeaty  of  its  movement. The  Epistle  to  the  Romans  is  the  ever-deepening  flow  of  a stately  i-iver ;  Second  Corintliians  is  the  rush  of  a  rapid  ;  Ephes- iana  is  the  solemn  swell  of  a  calm  sea.  Not  a  familiar  and personal  letter  like  Philippians  and  Philemon,  it  is,  equally  with these,  devoid  of  official  stateliness.  Its  dignity  is  that  of  the seer  rather  than  of  the  bishop  and  teacher.  It  riaes  at  times to  the  height  of  apocalypse.  The  impression  of  a  teacher  ex- pounding his  theme  ia  largely  merged  in  the  impression  of  a great  mind  and  an  adoring  aoul  maatered  and  swept  onward by  the  theme.   i   INTRODUCTION.  xxix  The  figure  of  a  cathedral,  into  which  Professor  Longfellow  has BO  finely  cast  his  general  conception  of  the  '^  Divina  Commedia,\" eqnaUj  well,  perhaps,  even  better,  suits  the  Ephesian  letter. If  the  expression  may  be  allowed,  that  epistle  is  the  veritable high-Grothic  of  sacred  literature  ;  every  line  and  detail  carrying the  eye  upward,  and  the  whole  combining  in  one  great  upreach, irradiated  with  the  rich  hues  of  ^^  the  many-tinted  wisdom  of God.''  Even  as  St.  Ouen  mirrors  its  lines  in  the  font  at  the portal,  the  whole  magnificent  ideal  of  the  Church  of  Christ condenses  itself  into  the  inscription  round  the  baptismal  laver — \"one  Lord,  one  Faith,  one  Baptism.\"  Every  window  is blazoned  with  its  story,  but  in  eadi  the  central  figure  is  the same— now  the  Victim  of  the  cross,  now  the  Conqueror  with  his train  of  captives,  now  the  King  ascended  and  throned  in  light. No  partition  with  its  rigid  lines  sunders  the  band  of  wor- shippers.  Jew  and  Gentile  kneel  side  by  side,  every  face turned  toward  the  cross.  On  the  very  threshold  the  ear  is greeted  with  a  burst  of  choral  thunder.  The  vast  aisles  throb with  praise,  crossed  with  the  minor  chords  of  penitent  rehearsal, and  the  deep  sighs  of  tempted  souls  struggHng  with  the  powers of  darkness ;  while  from  the  side-chapels  fioat  the  words  of admonition  to  the  newly-wedded,  and  of  homely  precept  for the  children  and  servants ;  and  over  all  the  sweet,  sad,  trium- phant tumult  is  heard  the  voice  of  the  great  apostle,  rising with  the  incense-cloud  from  before  the  altar  in  that  wondrous prayer,  never  surpassed  save  by  the  intercessions  of  Jesus  Him- self— \"  That  He  would  grant  you,  according  to  the  riches  of His  glory,  to  be  strengthened  with  might  by  His  Spirit  in  the inner  man ;  that  Christ  may  dwell  in  your  hearts  by  faith ; that  ye,  being  rooted  and  grounded  in  love,  may  be  able  to comprehend,  with  all  saints,  what  is  the  breadth,  and  length, and  depth,  and  height ;  and  to  know  the  love  of  Christ  which passeth  knowledge,  that  ye  might  be  filled  unto  all  the  fulness of  God.''   INTRODUCnOB.   THE   EPISTtK  •]   i   COL08SIAN8.   For  Ck>Ioe8ae,  Bee  on  Col.  i.  2.  The  GoBpel  was  first  preached  in  the  cities  of  the  Ljcub  by Epaphras  (Col.  i.  7 ;  iv.  12 ;  Phileiii.  23),  who  may  also  have founded  the  churches  there.  Tlie  theory  that  tlie  church  at ColoBsae  was  founded  by  Paul  lias  no  sufficient  foundation.* The  church  had  never  been  personally  visited  by  Paul.  Thougli his  missionary  journeys  had  carried  hira  into  the  Galatian  and Phrygian  country  (Acts  xvi.  6),  the  indefinite  usage  of  these terms,  the  absence  of  all  hints  of  a  visit  in  the  epistle  itself, and  the  notices  of  his  route  in  the  Acts,  go  to  show  that  bis path  did  not  lie  through  the  valley  of  the  Lycus.  Ch.  ii.  1, appears  to  indicate  that  the  Colossians  were  personally  unknown to  him.  The  occasion  of  the  letter  was  the  visit  of  Epaphras  to  the apostle  in  prison,  and  Paul's  communication  with  Colossae  in the  matter  of  the  restoration  of  Onesimus.  Whether  Epaphras ahared  his  captivity  or  not  (see  on  Fhilem.  23),  he  did  not  re- turn to  Colossae  witli  this  letter,  but  remained  in  Paul's  com- pany (Col.  iv.  12);  and  his  stay  in  Kome  was  long  enough  to put  the  apostle  fnlly  in  possesston  of  the  dangers  which  men- aced the  Colossian  chureli.  Paul  took  the  opportunity  of  Ty- chicus'  jonmey  to  Colossae  with  Onesimus,  to  send  this  letter.  Phrygia  was  a  favorable  soil  for  the  development  of  error. \"  Cosmological  speculation,  mystic  theosophy,  religious  fanati- cism, all  had  their  home  there.\"  +  The  leading  worship  was tliat  of  Cybele,  the  great  Mother  of  the  Gods,  which  was  spread over  Asia  Minor  generally,  and  especially  prevailed  in  Mysia and  Galatia.  It  was  orgiastic,  accompanied  with  frenzied dances,  howlings,  and  self-tnntilations.  Phrygia  was  also  the home  of  Ophitism,  or  serpent-worship.

XXXI  ecstasy  and  trance,  its  faith-cores,  its  glooinj  asceticism,  its  pas- sion for  martjrrdom,  and  its  savage  intolerance,  owed  to  Phry- gia  its  leader ;  and  the  earlier  name  of  the  sect  was  '^  the  S^t of  the  Phrygians.\"  Under  Antiochas  the  Great,  two  thousand  Jewish  families had  been  transplanted  into  Phrygia  and  Lydia ;  and  while  the staple  of  the  chnrch  was  GtentQe,  the  epistle  distinctly  recog- nizes the  presence  and  operation  of  Jewish  inflaences  (ii.  16-21).  The  form  of  error  which  prevailed  at  Colossae  included  three elements :  Jewish  formalism ;  speculative  mysticism,  represent- ing the  germs  of  what  afterward  developed  as  Gnosticism  ;  and Essenism,  the  medium  through  which  the  Jewish  and  Gnostic elements  came  into  combination.  Though  Gnosticism,  as  such,  had  not  developed  itself  at  this time,  a  knowledge  of  its  principal  features  is  necessary  to  an intelligent  reading  of  this  epistle.  It  took  its  name  from  grums  hnawledgej  since  it  claimed  for a  select  few  the  possession  of  a  superior  acquaintance  with truth.  Its  tendencies  were  thus  exclusive  and  aristocratic.  The Gnostics  denied  the  direct  creation  of  the  world  by  God,  be- cause Grod  would  thus  be  shown  to  be  the  creator  of  evil.  Ghxl's creative  energy  was  thwarted  by  the  world  of  matter,  which  is essentially  evil,  in  eternal  antagonism  to  God,  and  with  which Gk)d  could  not  come  into  direct  contact  without  tainting  His nature.  Hence  creation  became  possible  only  through  a  series of  emanations  from  God,  each  successive  emanation  being  less divine,  until  the  point  was  reached  where  contact  with  matter became  possible.  These  emanations  were  called  aeonSy  spirits, or  angels  ;  and  to  these  worship  was  rendered  with  an  affecta- tion of  humility  in  approaching  the  lower  grades  of  divinity,  in- stead of  venturing  into  the  immediate  presence  of  the  Supreme. The  evil  of  matter  was  to  be  escaped  either  by  rigid  abstinence from  the  world  of  sense,  or  by  independence  of  it.  The  system therefore  tended  to  the  opposite  extremes  of  asceticism  and licentiousness.  Essenism,  in  the  apostolic  age,  had  established  itself  in  Asia Minor.  The  Essenes  combined  the  ritualism  of  the  Jew  with the  asceticism  and  mysticism  of  the  Gnostic.     They  rigorously   xxxii  rSTRODUCTION.  observed  the  Mosaic  ritual,  except  id  the  matter  of  slain  sacri ficGB,  which  tliey  refueed  to  offer,  regarding  their  ordinary meals  bb  eacrificial  rites.  The;  discountenanced  nuarriage,  and foreswore  oil,  wine,  and  animal  food.  Their  theology  revealed traces  of  son-worship.  Holding  the  immortality  of  the  soul, they  denied  the  resurrection  of  the  body.  They  also  held some  mystical  doctrine  of  emanations,  as  agents  in  creation, akin  to  that  of  the  Gnostic  aeoDS.  Like  the  Gnostics,  they maintained  the  evil  of  matter.  Id  this  epistle  Paul  strikes  at  the  intellectnal  exclusiveness of  the  Colossian  heretics  with  the  doctrino  of  the  universality  of the  Gospel  (i.  6,  23,  28;  iii.  11).  Their  pnoaw — the  pretended higher,  esoteric  wisdom — is  met  with  the  assertion  of  the  Gos- pel as  the  true  wisdom,  the  common  property  of  all  believers.

Divine  wisdom  is  offered  and  prayed  for  as the  privilege  of  Chrietians  (i.  9,  27,  2S;  iii.  10,  16).  The  pre- tended wisdom  is  denounced  as  deceitful  philosophy,  founded in  tradition,  and  both  its  Gentile  and  its  Jewish  phases  are characterized  aa  more  elemenU  or  rudiTnetiie,  unworthy  of  men in  Christ  (ii.  8,  20).  It  is  presumptuous  and  arrogant;  a  mere show  of  wisdom  (ii.  18,  23).  The  doctrine  of  angelic  mediators  in  the  creation  and  govern- ment of  the  world  is  offset  by  the  truth  of  tJie  Eternal  Son, begotten  before  the  creation,  by  whom  all  things  were  created and  are  maintained,  and  who  is  also  the  only  and  absolute  head of  the  Church  (i.  15-18).  For  a  succession  of  augeJic  emana- tions,  each  less  divine  than  its  predecessor,  is  substituted  the Son  of  God,  in  whom  dwells  the  sum-total  of  the  divine  powers and  attributes  (i.  19;  ii.  9).  An  angel  or  spirit,  who  is  neither God  nor  man,  cannot  reconcile  God  and  man.  For  the  hazi- nese  which  invests  the  personality  and  character  of  these  inter- mediaries, we  have  the  sliarply  defined  personality  of  Christ, the  Word  made  flesh,  uniting  in  Himself  the  human  and  tlio divine,  human  even  unto  death,  divine  unto  the  eternal  life  and   A   INTBODUCnON.  XXXiii  power  of  the  Godhead,  and  thus  reconciling  and  bringing  into perfect  nnity  all  things  in  Himself  (i.  19,  22 ;  ii.  9,  10).  The  person  of  Christ  is  thus  exhibited  in  two  aspects,  the oosmical  and  the  theological,  in  its  relations  to  the  nniverse and  to  the  Church.  On  the  one  hand,  Christ  is  supreme  in  the creation  and  administration  of  the  world  (i.  15-17).  ^^  He  is the  beginning,  middle,  and  end  of  creation.\"  On  the  other hand,  Christ  is  supreme  in  the  spiritual  economy.  *^If  the function  of  Christ  is  unique  in  the  universe,  so  is  it  also  in the  Church.\"  In  Him  alone  man  is  reconciled  and  united  to Gk>d.  In  Him  alone  the  individual  children  of  Qtod  are  com- pacted into  one  body,  propelled  and  guided  in  their  several  ac- tivities, and  each  placed  and  held  in  due  relation  to  the  whole (L  18,  22 ;  ii.  10-15, 19).  In  this  rigorous  insistence  upon  the  person  of  Christ  as  alone solving  the  problem  of  God's  relation  to  the  world,  Paul  strikes not  only  at  the  Colossian  error,  but  also  at  the  later  error  of Arius,  whose  Christ  is  of  a  different  essence  from  God,  His participation  in  the  divine  attributes  partial,  and  His  revelation therefore  limited  and  imperfect.  Arianism  furnishes  a  prin- ciple of  conduct,  but  not  a  basis  of  communion  between  the  di- vine and  the  human.  ^^  The  supernatural  being  whom  Arius sets  forth  as  a  mediator  between  God  and  man,  does  not  unite, but  separates  them,  for  He  serves  to  reveal  the  infinite,  impass- able gulf  that  lies  between  them.\"  *  Bishop  Lightfoot  most  truthfully  remarks :  ^^  Christ's  media- torial function  in  the  Church  is  represented  as  flowing  from His  mediatorial  function  in  the  world.  With  oui^selves  this idea  has  retired  very  much  into  the  background.  Though  in the  creed  common  to  all  the  churches  we  profess  our  belief  in Him  as  the  Being  through  whom  all  things  were  created,  yet in  reality  this  confession  seems  to  exercise  very  little  influence on  our  thoughts.  And  the  loss  is  serious.  How  much  our theological  conceptions  suffer  in  breadth  and  fulness  by  the neglect,  a  moment's  reflection  will  show.     How  much  more   *  Alexander  V.  6.  AUen,  *'The  Gontinaity  of  Christian  Thought.\"    See alio  Newman's  **  Ariana  of  the  Fourth  Oentnry,**  oh.  iL,  seo.  ▼.

Cbriet  is presented  as  the  legitimate  object  of  adoration,  the  refusal  of which  is  a  ruptnre  of  the  connection  between  the  membera  of the  body  and  tiieir  Head  (ii.  18,  19).  AJl  things  must  be  done in  His  name.  The  intercourse  of  the  Church,  the  relations  of the  household,  are  to  take  their  impulse  and  character  directly from  the  indwelling  word  of  Christ  (iii.  16-25),  The  Essene view  of  marriage  is  tlius  assailed  (iii.  18,  19).  Asceticisin, legalism,  ritualism  are  condemned  as  fixing  the  mind  upon mere  external  things.  Their  precepts  are  the  merest  rudiments of  an  earthly  and  sensual  economy—\"  shadows  of  things  to come.\"  The  imposition  of  these  precepts  is  a  moral  tyranny  ; \"mere  legal  obligations  are  a  part  of  a  dead  compact,  a  torn and  cancelled  bond,  which  is  now  nailed  to  Christ's  cross.\" Tliey  do  not  lift  the  life  into  the  higher  moral  and  spiritual plane;  they  do  not  protect  it  against  tiie  temptations  of  the flesh;  they  furnish  no  efficient  remedy  for  sin  (ii.  8,  16,  20, 23).  Reconciliation  with  God  through  the  blood  of  the  cross will  set  the  thoughts  on  heavenly  things,  will  strangle  unholy passions  and  indulgences,  and  will  create  a  new  man  in  tlio image  of  Christ  (i.  20 ;  ii.  11,  14;  iii.  1-10).  By  this,  asceti- cism and  licentiousness  are  alike  branded  (iii.  5).  The  genuineness  and  authenticity  of  the  epistle  were  uni- versally acknowledged  by  the  early  Church,  and  not  seriously questioned  until  the  attack  of  Mayerhoff  in  1838,  followed  by Baiir  and  Schwegler.  Holtzmann  (1872)  held  that  it  was  partly spurious,  though  containing  a  genuine  epistle,  which  he  fancied   *  Introduotlon   to   the    \"  CommenUrj   on   ColoMUas.\"     Sea   »1bo   Aubrey Modts'b  Biwy,  \"  The  Chriitlaa  Doctrine  of  Ood,\"  in  \"  Lnx  Haiidi,\"  p.  M   INTRODUCTION.  XXXV  that  he  could  extract  Dr.  Davidson  denies  the  Pauline  author- aliip,  and  thinks  it  was  written  about  120  a.d.  The  assaults  are, in  part,  on  the  same  grounds  as  those  against  Ephesians — textual and  grammatical  departures  from  Paul's  style,  unique  forms  of expression,  and  differences  of  idea.  Against  Colossians  in  par- ticular it  is  urged  that  the  errors  it  attacks  are  later  than  Paul's date.  The  Pauline  authorship  cannot  be  overthrown  by  any  of these  considerations.  As  to  the  errors  treated  in  the  epistle, it  has  already  been  shown  that  they  contained  the  germs  of later  Gnosticism.  The  variations  in  style  are  no  greater  than those  which  appear  in  different  writings  by  the  same  author. They  are  easily  explained  by  difference  of  subject,  and  by the  mental  changes  in  the  writer  himself.  Many  of  the unique  words  are  echoes  of  the  vocabulary  of  the  heretical teachers  (see  especially  in  ch.  iL  and  notes),  and  every  epistle of  Paul  contains  numerous  words  which  are  found  nowhere else.  Not  counting  those  which  occur  in  the  Septuagint,  there are  over  a  hundred  in  both  Romans  and  First  Corinthians ;  over ninety  in  Second  Corinthians;  thirty-three  or  four  in  6ala- tians ;  forty-one  in  Philippians ;  over  thirty  in  the  two  Thes- salonian  letters,  and  above  one  hundred  and  fifty  in  the  three Pastorals.  The  absence  of  peculiarly  Pauline  words  and  phrases it  is  only  necessary  flatly  to  deny.  Any  Greek  student  may satisfy  himself  on  that  point  by  means  of  a  Concordance.  The  Christology  of  the  epistle  is  that  of  the  earlier  epis- tles, only  more  fully  developed.  Notably  the  preexistence  of Christ  is  emphasized.  The  doctrine  of  Christ's  person  is  more fully  and  precisely  stated  than  in  any  other  of  Paul's  letters.  The  style  lacks  the  richness  and  rhythmical  sonorousness  of Ephesians.  This  arises  in  part  from  its  more  controversial character,  which  betrays  itself  in  Paul's  style,  here  as  elsewhere, by  his  employment  of  unusual  words  and  long  compounds. The  earlier  chapters  especially  are  marked  by  a  certain  stiffness which  is  imparted  by  the  rarity  of  the  ordinary  connecting particles,  and  the  connection  of  the  sentences  by  participial constructions  and  relative  pronouns,  or  by  \"  causal  and  inferen- tial conjunctions  \"  (see  ch.  i.).    Bishop  Lightfoot  observes  that   XIXVl  UJTRODDCTIOM.  \"  the  absence  of  all  personal  connection  with  tlie  Colossiaa church  will  partially,  if  not  wholly,  explain  the  dimiiiifihed fluency  of  this  letter.  At  the  eanie  time  no  epistle  of  Paul  is more  vigorous  in  conception  or  more  instinct  with  meaning. It  is  the  very  compreaflion  of  the  thoughts  which  creates  the difficulty.  If  there  is  a  want  of  fluency,  there  is  no  want  of force.\"  THE   EPISTLK  TO    PHILEMON.  This  epistle  is  the  only  private  letter  of  Paul  which  has  been preserved,  and  the  only  one  in  the  Kew  Testament  except  3 John.*  Oneaimus,  a  shive,  had  run  away  from  his  master,  Philemon, of  Colossae,  and  had  hidden  himself  in  Rome,  where  he  came under  Paul's  influence  and  was  converted  to  Christianity.  In  Ilia  loyalty  to  the  civil  law,  Paul  felt  that  Onesimus,  in fulfilment  of  his  Christian  duty,  should  return  to  his  master. Ue  had  probably  robbed  Philemon,  and  should  make  at  least this  restitution.  Ue  therefore  sent  Onesimus  back  to  Colossae under  the  escort  of  Tychicus,  who  carried  this  letter  to  Phile- mon.  Paul  did  not  attack  slavery  aa  an  institution.  He  did  not charge  Philemon  to  emancipate  his  slave.  For  the  final  extinc- tion of  slavery  he  relied  on  the  spirit  of  the  Gospel,  and  on  its principle  that  all  men  are  brethren  in  Christ  and  alike  servants of  tlie  one  heavenly  Master.  After  salutations  to  Philemon  and  his  household,  and  ac- knowledgments of  Philemon's  loving  service  to  the  Church  and to  himself,  he  introduces  the  main  subject  of  the  letter.  He asks  as  a  personal  favor  that  Philemon  will  kindly  receive Onesimus.  He  praises  the  ministries  of  the  latter  to  himself, playing  upon  his  name,  \"  once  ■unprojUahle  but  -aoviprojitaih\" and  expressing  his  desire  to  keep  him  with  himself.  This,  how- ever, he  will  not  do  without  Philemon's  consent.  If  Philemon shall  see  flt  to  retain  him  in  his  own  service,  he  will  find  him,  *  Possibly  2d  Jolin,  lliough  tu^la  lady  m«y  refer  to  a  ohurcb.  See  on  3 John,  ver.  1.   L   INTRODUCTION.  XXXVii  as  a  Christian,  far  more  valnable  than  he  was  as  a  pagan  slave. Perhaps  his  flight  was  divinely  permitted,  in  order  that  he might  retnm  to  his  master  as  a  Christian  brother.  He  hints delicately  at  Onesimos'  possible  thefts,  offering  his  personal security  for  the  amount  stolen,  though  intimating  that  Phile- mon is  already  in  his  debt  for  his  own  conversion.  He  is  sure that  Philemon  will  comply  with  his  request  He  thinks  he  will soon  be  released  from  prison,  and  asks  his  friend  to  prepare him  a  lodging  in  view  of  his  visit  The  epistle  has  always  been  celebrated  as  a  model  of  Christ- ian tact  and  courtesy.  Paul  waives  his  apostolic  right  to  com* mand,  and  throws  himself  upon  the  appeal  of  Christian  friend- ship, backing  it  with  a  delicate  allusion  to  his  sufferings  for  the Gospel's  sake.  Without  palliating  Onesimus'  fault,  he  throws round  him  the  protection  of  his  own  confidence  and  esteem. He  softens  the  phrases  which  describe  the  slave's  flight  and theft  He  does  not  say  ^^  he  ran  away,\"  but  ^^  he  was  separated from  thee.\"  He  does  not  say  ^^he  stole,\"  but,  ^^if  he  hath wronged  thee  or  oweth  thee  aught.\"  With  exquisite  tact  he assumes  that  Philemon  will  regard  Onesimus'  ministries  to  the prisoner  as  his  own,  and  will  rejoice  in  them  as  an  expression of  his  own  affection.  Few  sections  of  Scripture  contain  within  the  same  space  more topics  for  the  preacher.  Among  these  may  be  noted.  Fellowship in  Christian  service  (1,  2,  11,  12,  13,  19) :  Friendship  founded in  faith  (3,  5-7,  20) :  The  practical  quality  of  love  and  faith  (2, 5,  6,  7) :  The  true  method  of  Christian  persuasion  :  The  power of  the  Gospel  to  deal  with  the  worst :  The  Christian  method  of dealing  with  bad  social  institutions :  The  union  of  all  classes and  conditions  in  Christ.''^  The  letter  has  often  been  compared  with  the  younger  Pliny's epistle  to  Sabinianns,  written  under  similar  circumstances. Doddridge  remarks  that  although  antiquity  furnishes  no  exam- ple of  the  epistolary  style  equal  to  Pliny's  letter,  Paul's  letter   *  These  and  other  topics  are  most  beantifnUj  and  foroefnUj  treated  bj  the Rey.

Dr. Davidson  says :  \"  It  puts  Paul's  character  in  a  light  which  none other  of  his  writings  exhibit.  The  qualities  which  dictated  its composition  are  eminently  attractive.  Dignity,  generosity,  pru- dence, friendship,  politeness,  skilful  address,  purity,  are  appar- ent. Hence  it  has  been  called,  with  great  propriety, '  the  polite epiatle.'  Trne  delicacy,  fine  address,  consummate  courtesy,  nice strokes  of  rhetoric,  make  it  a  unique  specimen  of  the  epistolary style.  It  shows  the  perfect  Christian  gentleman.\"  Ewald : \"  Nowhere  can  the  sensibility  and  warmth  of  tender  friendship blend  more  beautifully  with  the  higher  feeling  of  a  eupeiior raiad,  nay,  of  a  teacher  and  apostle,  than  this  brief  and  yet  so eminently  significant  letter.\"  Kenan  :  \"  A  little  chef-d'oeitvro of  the  art  of  letter-writing.\"  Calvin  :  \"  Though  he  bandleth  a subject  which  otherwise  were  low  and  mean,  yet  after  bis  man- ner he  is  borne  up  aloft  unto  God.  With  such  modest  entreaty doth  he  humble  himself  on  behalf  of  the  lowest  of  men,  that scarce  anywhere  else  is  the  gentleness  of  his  spirit  portrayed more  truly  to  the  life.\"  Maclaren :  \"  Without  thought  of effect,  and  with  complete  imconsciousneBB,  this  man  beats  all the  famous  letter-writers  on  their  own  ground.  That  nnist have  been  a  great  intellect,  and  closely  conversant  witli  the Fountain  of  all  light  and  beauty,  which  could  shape  the  pro- found and  far-reaching  teachings  of  the  epistle  to  the  Colossians, and  pass  from  thera  to  the  graceful  simplicity  and  sweet  kind- liness of  this  exquisite  letter;  as  if  Michael  Angelo  had  gone straight  from  smiting  his  magnificent  Moses  from  the  marble mass,  to  incise  some  delicate  and  tiny  figure  of  Love  or  Friend- ship on  a  cameo.\"  The  authenticity  of  the  epistle  is  conceded.

God  did  hwden  of  old, and  Elill  He  bardenB  when  sin  is  cheriBhed.\"     (Uorison. )  And  jet  the  operation  of  these  forces  did  not  esclude  moral agency  or  moral  freedom.  No  irresistible  constraiut  compelleil Pharaoh  to  yield  to  this  preBsure  toward  evil.  Hia  power  of  choice was  recognized,  assumed,  and  appealed  to.  He  could  not  plead ignorance,  for  God  instructed  him  through  Moses.  He  could  not plead  doubt  of  God's  power,  for  God  wrought  before  his  eyes  an unexampled  seriea  of  wonders.  If  any  \"  viaitinga  of  nature  \"  could have  power  over  him,  the  misery  of  his  slave  population  was  before his  eyes.  Only  when  all  these  influences  hod  been  repelled,  and all  opportunities  for  yielding  scornfully  rejected,  did  God  have  re- course to  judgment.  God  raised  up  Pharaoh  in  order  to  show  His power ;  but  two  opposite  exhibitions  of  God's  power  in  Pharaoh were  poasible.  If  he  had  yielded,  he  would  have  been  a  co-worker ■n-ith  God  in  the  evolution  of  the  Jewish  commonwealth.  God's power  would  have  been  displayed  in  the  prosperity  of  his  kingdom, as  it  was  through  the  presence  of  Joseph.  He  resisted,  and  God's power  was  terribly  manifested  in  his  torment  and  final  destruction.  \"No  one,\"  as  Muller  observes,  \"can  withdraw  himself  from  the range  and  influence  of  God's  revelations,  without  altering  his  moral atatua.\"*  Hence,  though  it  ia  affirmed  that  God  hardened  Pha- raoh's heart — the  side  of  the  statement  which  best  suits  the  imme- diate purpose  of  Paul's  argument — it  ia  also  affirmed  that  Pharaoh hardened  his  own  heart  (compare  Exod.  iv,  21  ;  vii  3  ;  ix.  12  ;  x. 20,  27;  XL  10;  and  viii.  15,  32;  ix.  34)  |.  The  divine  and  the human  agencies  work  freely  side  by  side.  Tlio  cases  of  both  Moses  and  Pharaoh  make  against  the  charge of  God's  injuatice  toward  the  unbeheving  Jews,  since  they  show  •  \"  Dootrine  of  Bin.\"  f  ChsTns,  on  Taaiah  vi.  9,  10,  whlah  Bboald  be  oompared  with  this  passage, ujl  that  the  phrase  \"  hardening  of  the  heait \"  iB  oa\\y  twiae  applied  to  indi- viduals ia  books  of  the  Old  Testament ;  Dunel}-,  to  Pharaoh,  and  to  Sihon, King  of  Heahbon  (Deut.  ii.  30).

HS  thnt  He  acts  conaistently  on  the  pnDciple  of  exercising  His  diviin' Bovereignty  according  to  Hia  supreme  will ;  but  tbey  also  furnis!; another  argument  to  the  Bame  effect,  by  ehoning  that  He  exerciser His  sorereigntj  with  long-Buffering  and  mercy.  The  God  who  acts with  mercy  and  forbearance  cannot  be  unrighteouH.  God'a  revelii- tion  to  Moses  was  a  diaplay  of  His  great  mercy.  In  it  He  repealed \"  the  Lord  God,  merciful  and  gracious,  long-suffering,  and  abund- ant in  goodness  and  truth,  keeping  mercy  for  thousands,  forpjiv- ing  iniquity,  transgression,  and  ain,  and  that  will  by  no  means clear  the  Ruilty  \"  (Exod.  xxxiv.  6,  7).  God'a  dealing  with  Pharaoh was  marked  by  forbearance,  opportunities  for  repentance,  instruct- ion, and  chastisement.  Verses  19,  20,  21  are  not  properly  port  of  the  proof,  but  are  in- troduced by  way  of  rebuke  to  a  presumptuous  question  or  chal- lenge ;  so  that,  in  the  regular  line  of  the  argument,  we  may  pro- ceed directly  from  the  close  of  ver,  18  to  ver.  22.  (19.)  The  objector  now  catches  at  the  words,  \"whom  He  wiU He  bai-denetb,\"  as  an  opportunity  (or  shifting  the  responsibility from  himself  to  God.  If  God  hardens,  why  blame  the  hardened  ? If  God  ordains,  who  can  resist  His  will  ?  The  fault  of  interpretation  at  this  point  Ues  in  construing  Paul's answer  as  a  counter- argument ;  whereas  Paul  does  not  entertain tbe  objector's  words  as  an  argument  at  alL  He  neither  admits, denies,  nor  answers  them  as  an  argument  His  reply  is  directed solely  at  the  objector's  attUade  as  a  challenger  of  God.  It  is  a  re- buke of  the  creature  for  charging  his  sin  upon  tbe  Creator.  Paul is  not  dealing  with  tbe  objector's  logic,  but  with  the  sublime  im- pudence of  the  objector  himself.  He  ia  not  vindicating  God against  the  charge,  nor  exposing  the  falsity  of  the  charge  itself.  For  if  this  answer  of  Paul,  with  tbe  similitude  of  the  potter  and tbe  clay,  is  to  be  taken  as  an  argument  for  God's  right  to  harden men  at  Hi>t  arbitrary  pleasure,  then  Paul  ia  open  to  rebuke  quite as  much  as  his  opponent.  For,  in  the  first  place,  the  answer  is  a tacit  admission  of  the  Jew's  premiss,  and,  in  tbe  second  place,  re- garded as  an  answer  to  an  argument,  it  ia  a  specimen  of  the  moat brutal  dogmatism,  and  of  tbe  most  faUacious  and  shallow  logic,  if it  can  be  called  logic  at  all.  This  is  the  case,  in  brief.  The  Jew. \"God  hardens  at  Hia  arbitrary  will  and  pleasure.     If,  therefore,   u   144  WORD  STUDIES  IN  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT.  (Ch.  XI  He  hardened  me  so  that  I  could  not  believe,  He  is  to  blame,  not  1 Why  does  He  find  fault  with  me  for  not  believing?  If  He  is  su- preme, who  can  resist  Hia  will  ?  \"  Paul.  \"  Suppose  He  did  harden you  so  that  you  could  not  believe,  what  have  you  to  say  about  it? Shut  your  mouth  I  God  does  as  He  pieaees  with  you.  You  are simply  a  lump  of  clay  m  the  hands  of  a  potter,  and  must  be  con- tent to  be  what  tbe  potter  makes  you.\"  From  this  point  of  view  it  must  be  said  that  tbe  objector  baa the  best  of  it,  and  that  Paul's  answer  is  no  answer.  Regarded  as au  ar^ment,  it  is  an  argument  from  an  analogy  wbich  is  no  anal- ogy. Man,  on  God's  own  showing,  is  not  a  lump  of  senseless  clay. He  is  a  sentient,  reasoning  being,  endowed  by  God  with  the  power of  self-determination.  God  Himself  cannot  and  does  not  treat  him as  a  lump  of  clay ;  and  to  assert  such  a  relation  between  God  and man  made  in  God's  image,  is  to  assert  what  is  contrary  to  common sense  and  to  God's  own  declarations  and  assumptions  in  Scripture. The  objector  might  well  turn  upon  Paul  and  say,  \"  Well,  then,  if man  ia  only  a  lump  of  clay,  and  therefore  without  right  or  power to  reply,  who,  pray,  art  thou  that  repliest/or  God  ?  Thou  art,  on thine  own  showing,  a  lump  of  clay  like  myself.  If  clay  cannot  and must  not  reason  nor  answer,  what  is  the  peculiar  quality  of  (/ly clay  which  entitles  thee  to  apeak  as  God's  advocate?\"  It  is  quite  safe  to  say  that  Paul  is  too  good  a  reasoner,  and  too well  acquainted  with  the  character,  the  word,  ond  tbe  economy  of God  as  displayed  in  the  history  of  his  own  race,  to  bo  betrayed into  any  such  logical  absurdity  as  this :  too  thoroughly  humane, too  mindful  of  his  own  deep  doubts  and  questionings,  too  trans- parently candid  to  meet  even  a  conceited  and  presumptuous  argu- ment with  a  counter-argument  consisting  of  a  bare  dogma  and  a false  analogy.  Paul  does  not  admit  that  God  made  the  Jew  siu. He  does  not  admit  that  God  made  the  Jew  incapable  of  believing. He  does  not  admit  that  the  responsibility  for  tlie  Jew's  rejection lies  anywhere  but  with  himself.  Yet  even  the  figure  of  the  potter  and  the  clay,  properly  under- stood, might  have  suggested  to  tbe  angry  Jew  something  beside the  thought  of  sovereign  power  and  will  arbitrarily  moulding  help- less matter.   THE  EPISTLB  TO  THE  ROMANS.   THR    POTTKB    AND    THB    OUT.   The  iUnBtnitioQ  is  a  common  one  in  tlie  Old  Testament  and  it is  reasonable  tbat  Paul's  use  of  it  should  be  uolored  hy  its  usage there.  It  occurs  in  Jeremiah  sviji.  1-10.  Jeremiah,  in  great  deBpond- encj  over  the  demoralization  of  Israel,  was  bidden  to  go  down  to the  potter's  house.  The  potter  shaped  a  vessel  on  the  wheel,  but, owing  to  some  defect  in  the  clay,  the  veBsel  was  marred.  So  the potter  made,  of  the  same  lump,  another  vessel  different  from  that which  he  had  at  first  designed.  He  did  not  throw  away  the  claj, but  his  skill  prevailed  to  triumph  over  the  defect,  and  to  make  a vessel,  perhaps  inferior  to  the  first,  yet  still  capable  of  use.  So God  had  designed  Israel  for  a  high  destiny,  a  royal  nation,  a  pe- culiar people  ;  but  Israel  defeated  this  destiny  by  its  idolatries and  rebellious.  Hence  God  made  it  another  and  baser  vessel. \"  The  pressure  of  the  potter's  hand  waa  to  be  harder.  Shame  and suffering  and  exile — their  land  left  desolate,  and  they  themselves weeping  by  the  waters  of  Babylon — this  was  the  process  to  which they  were  now  called  on  to  submit.\"  The  potter  exercised  his power  by  making  the  vessel  unto  dishonor  which  he  originally  de- signed unto  honor.  Side  by  side  with  the  potter's  power  over  the clay,  there  goes,  figuratively  speaking,  in  the  prophet's  representa- tion, the  power  of  change  and  choice  in  the  lump.  \"  Ye  are  in  my hand  as  this  clay  in  the  hand  of  the  potter.  If,  when  I  am  about to  degrade  the  nation,  they  turn  from  their  evil.  I  will  repent  of the  evit.  On  the  contrary,  when  I  am  planning  for  an  honorable and  powerful  kingdom,  if  the  people  turn  to  evil,  then  I  will  re- pent of  the  good  wherewith  I  aaid  that  I  would  benefit  them.\" Israel  has  a  power  of  choice.  If  it  is  made  into  a  vessel  unto  dis- honor, the  fault  is  its  own,  but  repentance  and  suhmissioQ  may change  the  issue.  Look  again  at  Isaiah  xxix.  IG.  This  passage  occurs  iu  the  pro- phecy concerning  Jerusalem  under  the  name  of  Ariel.  The  prophet predicts  siege,  thunder,  and  earthquake.  He  says  that  the  Lord hath  poured  on  the  people  the  spirit  of  deep  sleep,  and  hath  closed their  eyes  and  covered  their  heads,  so  that  the  prophetic  viaiou  ap- Voi^  III.— 10   i   liG  WORD  STUDIES  IN  TUK  NKW  TKaTAMBNT.

Thie  IB  OD  the  same  line  with  the  hardening  of  Pharaoh's  heart.  It is  ascribed  to  the  direct  agency  of  God.  But  immediately  there follows  the  statement  of  their  owu  responsibility  for  their  sin.  The people  have  removed  their  heart  from  the  Lord  and  worship  Him with  the  hps  only.  Therefore,  God  will  proceed  to  do  marvellous  and terrible  works  among  them.  0  your  perverseness  I  Tliiiik  you  you can  hide  your  counsel  from  God?  \"Surely  your  turning  of  things upside  down  shall  be  esteemed  as  the  potter's  clay ;  for  shall  the work  aay  of  him  that  made  it,  '  He  made  me  not? '  or  shall  the  thinf; framed  say  of  him  that  framed  it,  'He  hath  no  understanding?'\" In  other  words,  why  do  men  think  that  they  can  escape  God  by  hid- ing their  purposes  fromffim?  Shall  God  (the  potter)  be  accounted as  clay  (the  man)  ?  Shall  man  ignore  the  fact  that  he  was  made  by Ood,  and  act  as  if  God  had  no  understanding?  The  parallel  be- tween this  utterance  and  that  in  Romans  ix.  will  be  evident  at  a  Isa.  xlv,  9.  The  prophecy  concerning  Cyrus.  God  calls  hini, though  a  heathen,  for  the  soke  of  Jacob  His  servant,  and  Israel  His elect  In  this  call  God  asserts  His  sovereignty:  \"lam  Jehovah, and  there  is  none  else.  I  girded  thee  when  thou  knewest  me  not.\" This  idea  is  further  carried  out  by  the  figure  of  the  potter  and  the clay.  \"  Woe  to  him  that  striveth  with  his  maker.  Let  the  potsherd strive  with  the  potsherds  of  the  earth.  Shall  the  clay  say  to  bjm that  fashioned  it,  'What  makest  thou?' or  thy  work,  'He  hath  no hands?'\"  The  same  thought  appears  in  ver.  10.  Shall  a  child remonstrate  with  its  parents  because  they  have  brought  into  the world  a  being  weak,  ugly,  or  deformed?  And  again,  in  ver.  11: \"Concerning  the  things  to  come  will  ye  question  me?  Concerning my  children  and  the  work  of  my  hands  will  ye  lay  commands  upon me  ?    It  was  I  that  made  the  earth  and  created  the  men  upon  it,\"  etc.  Along  with  these  declarations  of  absolute  sovereignty,  which silence  the  hps  of  men,  stand  exhortations  which  assume  the  power of  free  choice.  \"  I  said  not  unto  the  seed  of  Jacob  '  Seek  ye  me in  vain.'\"  \"Assemble  yourselves  and  come.\"  \"Let  them  take counsel  together.\"     \"  Turn  ye  unto  me  and  be  ye  saved.\"  Isa.

Either  that  the  intent  of  the  law  was  to make  men  righteous,  which  was  accomplished  in  Christ,  or  that the  law  led  to  Him  as  a  paedagogue  (Gal.  iii.  24).  2,  The  fxd- jUment,  as  Matt,  v.

The  last  is  prefer- able. Paul  is  discussing  two  materially  exclusive  systems,  tiio one  based  on  doing,  the  other  on  Mi,eving.  The  system  of faith,  represented  by  Christ,  brings  to  an  end  and  excludes  the system  of  law ;  and  the  Jews,  in  holding  by  the  system  of  law, fail  of  the  righteousness  wliich  is  by  faith.

Paul  recognizes a  secondary  meaning  in  Moses'  words,  and  thus  changes  the original  expressions  so  as  to  apply  them  to  the  Christian  faith- system.  His  object  in  the  change  is  indicated  by  the  explana- tory words  which  he  adds.  lie  does  not  fonnally  declare  that Moses  describes  the  righteousness  of  faith  in  these  words,  but appropriates  the  words  of  Moses,  putting  them  into  the  mouth of  the  personified  faith-righteousness.

The  two  ideas  may  be  reconciled  in  the  fac'. that  the  Jew  conceived  the  sea  as  the  abyss  of  waters  on  which the  earth  rested.  Compare  £xod.  xx.  4.  Thus  the  ideas  heyond the  sea  and  heneaih  the  earth  coincide  in  designating  the  realm of  the  dead.

See  ver.  9.  Moses  used  it  of  tlie  law.  See  on  Luke  i.  37.  The whole  quotation  in  the  Hebrew  is  as  follows:  \"It  (the  coci- mandmentj  is  not  in  heaven,  that  ye  should  say,  Who  will ascend  for  us  to  heaven,  and  bring  it  to  us,  and  make  us  hear it  that  we  may  do  it?

But  the  word is  very  near  thee,  in  thy  mouth  and  in  thy  heart,  to  do  it.\"' The  object  of  the  passage  is  to  contrast  the  system  of  faith  with the  system  of  law,  and  that,  especially,  with  reference  to  the remoteness  and  difficulty  of  righteousness.  Moses  says  that  the comroaodment  of  God  to  Israel  is  not  incapable  of  aiscoinpiieh- ment,  nor  is  it  a  distant  thing  to  be  attained  only  by  long  and laborious  effort.  The  people,  on  the  contrary,  carries  it  in  its mouth,  and  it  is  stamped  upon  its  heart.  Compare  Exod.  xiii. 9 ;  DeuL  vi,  6-9.  In  applying  these  words  to  the  system  of faith,  Paul,  in  like  manner,  denies  that  this  system  involves any  painful  search  or  laborious  work.  Christ  has  accomp- lished the  two  great  things  necessary  for  salvation.  He  has descended  to  earth  and  has  risen  from  the  dead.  All  that  is necessary  is  to  accept  by  faith  the  incarnate  and  risen  Clirist, instead  of  having  recourse  to  the  long  and  painful  way  of  es- tablishing one's  own  righteousness  by  obedience  to  the  law.

The  voice  of  the  gospel  message  is  like that  of  the  starry  sky  proclaiming  Ood^s  glory  to  all  tlie  earth. The  Septuagint  sotmd  seems  to  be  a  free  rendering  in  order  to secure  parallelism  with  words.*  Of  the  world  (r^  oueovfievi]^).  See  on  Luke  ii.  1;  John i.  9.  19.

Human  per- sonality is  derived  from  spirit  {irv€vfAa\\  and  finds  expression  in soul  or  life  i^^vx^).  The  New- Testament  usage  follows  the  Old,  in  denoting  all individuals  from  the  point  of  view  of  individual  life.  Thus the  phrase  Traa-a  y^vx^  every  eoulj  i.e.,  every  j>er8on  (Rom.  ii.  9 ; xiii.  1),  marking  them  ofiF  from  inanimate  nature.

These  and  other  passages  are  opposed  to  the  view  which  lim- its the  term  to  a  mere  animal  life-principle.

See,  especially  1  Thess.  v.  23.  As  to  the  distinction  between  '^^vj(ri  soul  and  irvevfui  spirity it  is  to  be  said :  1.  That  there  are  cases  where  the  meanings  approach  very closely,  if  they  are  not  practically  synonymous;  especially  where the  individuid  life  is  referred  to.  See  Luke  i.  47 ;  John  xi.  33, and  xii.  27 ;  Matt.  xi.  29,  and  1  Cor.  xvi.  18.  2.  That  the  distinction  is  to  be  rejected  which  rests  on  the restriction  of  y^vxn  to  the  principle  of  animal  life.  This  cannot be  maintained  in  the  face  of  1  Cor.  xv.  45 ;  ii.  14,  in  which latter  the  kindred  adjective  ^^vx^^fco^  natural  has  reference  to the  faculty  of  discerning  spiritual  truth.

It  is  rather  between  two sides  of  the  one  immaterial  nature  whicti  stands  in  contrast  with the  body.  Spirit  expresses  the  conception  of  that  nature  more generally,  being  used  hoth  of  the  earthly  and  of  the  non-earthly spirit,  while  soul  designates  it  on  the  side  of  the  creature.

Eotli  the  first-fruits  and  the root  represent  the  patriarchs  (or  Abraham  singly,  compare  ver. 28).  The  holiness  by  call  and  destination  of  the  nation  as represented  by  its  fathers  (first-fruits,  root)  implies  their  future restoration,  the  holiness  of  the  lump  and  branches.  17.

Paul's  figure  is:  The  Jewish  nation  is  a  tree  from  which some  branches  have  been  cut,  but  which  remains  living  because the  root  (and  therefore  all  the  branches  connected  with  it)  is still  alive.  Into  this  living  tree  the  wild  branch,  the  Gentile, is  grafted  among  the  living  branches,  and  thus  draws  life  from the  root.  The  insertion  of  the  wild  branches  takes  place  in connection  with  the  cutting  ofiF  of  the  natural  branches  (the bringing  in  of  the  Gentiles  in  connection  with  the  rejection  of the  Jews).  But  the  grafted  branches  should  not  glory  over  the natural  branches  because  of  the  cutting  ofiF  of  some  of  the  latter, since  they  derive  their  life  from  the  common  root  ^^  The  life- force  and  the  blessing  are  received  by  the  Gentile  through  the Jew,  and  not  by  the  Jew  through  the  Gentile.  The  spiritual plan  moves  from  the  Abrahamic  covenant  downward,  and  from the  Israelitish  nation  outward\"  (Dwight).  The  figure  is  challenged  on  the  ground  that  the  process  of grafting  is  the  insertion  of  the  good  into  the  inferior  stock, while  here  the  case  is  reversed.  It  has  been  suggested  in  ex- f)lanation  that  Paul  took  the  figure  merely  at  the  point  of  in- serting  one  piece  into  another ;  that  he  was  ignorant  of  the   J28  WORD  BTUDIB9   IN  THE   SEVf   TESTAMENT.

It  is  only  in  the  kingdom  of  grace  that a  process  thus  contrary  to  natnre  can  be  successful;  and  it  is tliis  circumstance  which  the  apostle  has  seized  upon  to  magnify the  mercy  shown  to  the  Gentiles  by  grafting  them,  a  wild  race, contrary  to  the  nature  of  such  operations,  into  the  good  olive- tree  of  tlie  church,  and  causing  them  to  flourish  there  and bring  forth  fruit  unto  eternal  life.  The  apostle  lived  in  the land  of  the  olive,  and  was  in  no  danger  of  falling  into  a  blunder in  founding  liis  argument  upon  such  a  circumstance  in  its  cult- ivation\" (\"  Land  and  Book,  Lebanon,  Damascus  and  Beyond Joi-dan,\"  p.  35).  Meyer  says:  \"The  subject-matter  did  not require  the  figure  of  the  ordinary  grafting,  but  the  coni-erse — the  grafting  of  the  wild  scion  and  its  ennobteraent  thereby. The  Gentile  scion  was  to  receive,  not  to  impart,  fertility.\"  18.  The  branches.  Of  the  oHve-trea  generally,  Jewish Christians  and  unbelieving  Jews.

PAUL'S  ARGUMENT  IN  BOMANS  IX.,  X.,  AND  XL  Thkb  chapierSy  as  they  are  the  meet  difficult  of  Pftol's  writings, Lave  been  most  misunderstood  and  misapplied.  Their  most  dan- gerous perversion  is  that  which  draws  from  them  the  doctrine  of Crod's  arbitrary  predestination  of  individuals  to  eternal  life  or  etern- al perdition.  It  can  be  shown  that  such  is  not  the  intent  of  these  chapters. They  do  not  discuss  the  doctrine  of  individual  election  and  repro- bation with  reference  to  eternal  destiny.  The  treatment  of  this question  is  subordinate  to  a  different  purpose,  and  is  not,  as  it  is not  intended  to  be,  exhaustive.  At  the  time  when  the  epistle  was  written,  this  question  was  not agitating  the  Church  at  large  nor  the  Eoman  church  in  particular. Had  this  been  the  case,  we  may  be  sure,  from  the  analogy  of  other epistles  of  Paul,  that  he  would  have  treated  it  specifically,  as he  does  the  doctrine  of  justification  by  faith,  in  this  epistle, and  the  questions  of  idol-meats  and  the  resurrection  in  first  Corin- thians.  Such  a  discussion  would  not  have  been  germane  to  the  design  of this  epistle,  which  was  to  imfold  the  Christian  doctrine  of  justifica- tion by  faith,  as  against  the  Jewish  doctrine  of  justification  by work&  The  great  question  which  was  then  agitating  the  Church  was  the relation  of  Judaism  to  Christianity.  Paul  declared  that  Christian- ity had  superseded  Judaism.  The  Jew  maintained,  either,  that  the Messiah  had  not  come  in  the  person  of  Jesus  Christ,  and  that Christianity  was  therefore  an  imposture  ;  or  that,  admitting  Jesus to  be  the  Messiah,  He  had  come  to  maintain  the  law  and  the  insti- tutions of  Judaism  :  that,  therefore,  entrance  into  the  messianic kingdom  was  possible  only  through  the  gate  of  Judaism  ;  and  that the  true  Christian  must  remain  constant  to  all  the  ordinances  and commandments  of  the  law  of  Moses.

Hence  the  Jew  \"  compassed  sea  and  laud  to  make one  proselyte  \"  (Matt.  iiiiL  15).  Every  Gentile  who  shoulJ  resist the  conquest  of  the  world  by  Israel  would  be  destroyed  by  Mes- siah. The  Jew  had  no  doubts  aa  to  the  absoluteneaa  of  the  divine sovereignty,  since  its  fancied  application  flattered  his  self-compla- cency and  national  pride.  All  Jews  were  elect,  and  all  others  were reprobate.  Paul's  proclamation  of  Messianic  privilege  to  the  Gen- tiles did,  perhaps,  quite  as  much  to  evoke  Jewish  hatred  against himself,  as  his  allegiance  to  the  Jesus  whom  the  Jews  had  crucified aa  a  malefactor.  The  discussion  in  these  three  chapters  fits  perfectly  into  this question.  It  is  aimed  at  the  Jews'  national  and  religious  conceit. It  is  designed  to  show  them  that,  notwithstanding  their  claim  to  be Qod's  elect  people,  the  great  mass  of  their  nation  has  been  justly rejected  by  God  ;  and  furtlier,  that  God's  elective  purpose  includes the  Gentiles.  Hence,  whOe  maintaining  the  truth  of  divine  sover- eignty in  the  strongest  and  most  positive  manner,  it  treats  it  on  a. grander  scale,  and  brings  it  to  bear  against  the  very  elect  thetn-   Early  in  the  discassion,  Paul  had  asserted  that  the  measianio salvation  had  been  decreed  to  the  Jevjfintl  (L  IC  ;  iL  10  :  compare John  i.  11).  In  the  face  of  this  stood  the  fact  that  the  Jewish  peo- ple generally  hod  rejected  the  offer  of  God  in  Christ,  Paul  him- self, after  offering  the  Gospel  to  the  Jews  at  Antioch  in  Pisidia,  had said  :  \"  It  was  necessary  that  the  word  of  Ood  should  Jirat  have been  spoken  to  you  ;  but  seeing  ye  put  it  from  you,  aad  judge yoiirselvei  unworthy  of  everlasting  life,  lo,  we  turn  to  the  Gentiles  \" (Acts  xiii.  46  ;  compare  Acts  sviii.  C).  Tiie  Jew  had  ^leii  under  the judgment  of  God  (Rom.  ii.  1,  2).  Resting  in  the  law,  ninkiug  bis boast  of  God,  claiming  to  be  a  guide  of  the  blind,  a  light  of  them which  are  in  darkness,  an  instructor  of  the  foolish,  and  haviug  the   Ch.  XI]  TUB  BPISTLB  TO  THB  BOMAKa  135  form  of  knowledge  and  of  the  truth  in  the  law,  he  had  made  him- self a  scandal  in  the  eyes  of  the  Oentiles  by  his  notorious  deprav- ity, and  had  proved  himself  to  be  not  a  Jew,  since  his  circumcision was  not  of  the  heart  (Bom.  iL  17-29).  Notwithstanding  these  facts,  the  Jew  claimed  that  because  he  uxu a  Jew  Ckxl  could  not  reject  him  consistently  with  His  own  election and  coTcnant  promise.  If  the  (Gospel  were  true,  and  Jesus  really the  Messiah,  the  promises  made  to  the  Jewish  people,  who  rejected the  Messiah,  were  nullified.  Or,  if  the  election  of  Ood  held,  Israel was  and  foreyer  remained  the  people  of  Ood,  in  which  case  the Oospel  was  false,  and  Jesus  an  impostor.  \"  Thus  the  dilemma seemed  to  be :  either  to  affirm  Gk>d's  faithfulness  to  His  own  elect- ion and  deny  the  Oospel,  or  to  affirm  the  Oospel,  but  give  the  lie to  the  divine  election  and  &ithfulnes&\"  (Gbdei)  Paul  must  face  this  problem.  It  lies  in  the  straight  line  of  his argument  Hints  of  it  have  already  appeared  in  chs.  iiL  1  sqq. ; iv.  L  The  discussion  necessarily  involves  the  truth  of  the  divine sovereignty  and  election.  In  studying  Paul's  treatment  of  this  question,  mistake  and  mis- construction are  easy,  because  the  truths  of  divine  sovereignty  and elective  freedom  require  to  be  presented  in  their  most  absolute  as- pect as  against  man's  right  to  dictate  to  Ood.  The  parallel  facts of  man's  free  agency  and  consequent  responsibility,  which  are equally  patent  in  these  chapters,  are,  at  certain  points,  thrown  into the  shade ;  so  that,  if  the  attention  is  fastened  upon  particular passages  or  groups  of  passages,  the  result  will  be  a  one-sided  and untruthful  conception  of  the  divine  economy,  which  may  easily  run into  a  challenge  of  Ood's  justice  and  benevolence.  The  assertion Ood  must  act  according  to  my  construction  of  His  promise  and  de- crecy  can  be  met  only  by  the  bare,  hard,  crushing  counter-statement Ood  is  supreme  and  does  as  lie  urill,  and  has  the  right  to  do  as  Ee toilL  This  assertion,  we  repeat,  does  not  exclude  the  element  of individual  freedom ;  it  does  not  imply  that  Ood  will  do  violence  to it ;  it  is  consistent  with  the  assumption  of  the  most  impartial  just- ice, the  most  expansive  benevolence,  the  tenderest  mercy,  the  pur- est love  on  Ood's  pari  The  argument  merely  sets  these  elements aside  for  the  time  being  and  for  a  purpose,  only  to  emphasize  them at  a  later  stage.

He  then returns  (vv.  30  sqq)  from  that  abatracllon  to  the  human  mora!  stand  point  of practloe,  10  that  be  allows  the  claims  of  both  modes  of  consideration  to  stand dde  by  aide,  joat  aa  the;  exist  side  b;  side  within  the  llmlta  of  human  thonght. The  ooutempUtion^ whioh  lies  bejond  theae  limiU — of  the  metaphyaical  rela- tion of  easentlal  interdependence  between  the  two — namelv,  objectivel;  di- vine and  subjectively  human,  freedom  and  activity  of  wilt — neceaaarilj  re- mained outxide  nnd  lieroiid  hia  aphere  of  view  ;  aa  he  would  have  had  no  oc- casion at  all  iu  this  place  to  enter  npon  tbig  problem,  seeing  that  it  was  in- oiimbeut  npon  him  to  crush  the  Jewish  pretensions  with  the  one  side  only  of 11— the  absoluteness  of  Qod.\"  That  tbe  factor  of  human  freedom  haa  full  scope  in  the  divioe economy  is  too  obvious  to  require  proof.  It  appears  in  numerous utterances  of  Paul  himself,  and  in  the  entire  drift  of  fw;ript«re, where  man's  power  of  moral  choice  is  both  asserted,  assumed,  and appealed  to  ;  where  tbe  punishment  of  unbelief  and  disobedience is  clearly  shown  to  be  due  to  man's  own  obstinacy  and  perversenessi. \"Were  this  not  tbe  case,  if  human  destiny  were  absolutely  and  un- changeably fixed  by  an  arbitrary  decree,  the  eihortationa  to  carry out  our  own  salvation,  to  obedience  and  perseverance  in  right- doing,  the  cautions  against  moml  Inpse,  tbe  plain  suggestions  of the  possibility  of  forfeiting  divine  blessings,  the  use  of  the  divine promises  themselves  as  appeals  to  repentance  and  holiness,  the recognitions  of  the  possibiUty  of  moral  transformation,  would  assert themselves  as  a  stupendous  farce,  a  colossal  and  cruel  satire.  It  must  suffice  for  us  that  these  two  factors  of  divine  sovereignty   Ch.  XL]  THE  EPISTLE  TO  THE  ROMANa  137  and  human  freedom  are  both  alike  distinctly  recognized  in  Script- ure. Their  interplay  and  mutual  adjustment  in  the  divine  adminis' tration  carry  us  out  of  our  depth.  Thai  matter  must  be  left  with Ood,  and  faced  by  man  with/ai^A,  not  with  knowledge.  That  there is  a  divine  election — the  act  of  Gkxl's  holy  will  in  selecting  His  own methods,  instruments,  and  times  for  carrying  out  His  own  pur- poses— is  a  fact  of  history  and  of  daily  observation.  It  appears  in the  different  natural  endowments  of  men ;  in  the  distribution  of those  natural  advantages  which  minister  to  the  strength  or  weak- ness of  nations ;  in  the  inferiority  of  the  Ethiopian  to  the  Caucasian ; in  the  inteUectual  superiority  of  a  Kant  or  a  Descartes  to  a  Chinese coolie.  '*  It  is  true,  and  no  argnment  can  gainsay  it,  that  men  are  placed  in  the world  unequally  favored,  both  in  inward  disposition  and  outward  oiroum- stances.  Some  children  are  bom  with  temperaments  which  make  a  life  of innocence  and  purity  natural  and  easy  to  them  ;  others  are  bom  with  violent passions,  or  even  with  distinct  tendencies  to  evil,  inherited  from  their  ances- tors and  seemingly  unconquerable  ;  some  are  constitutionally  brave,  others are  constitutionally  cowards  ;  some  are  bom  in  religious  families  and  are  care- fully educated  and  watched  over  ;  others  draw  their  first  breath  in  an  atmo- sphere of  crime,  and  cease  to  inhale  it  only  when  thej  pass  into  their  graves. Only  a  fourth  part  of  mankind  are  bom  Christians.  The  remainder  nevet hear  the  name  of  Christ  except  as  a  reproach.*'    (Froude,  \"CalvinisnL\")  Such  election  must  needs  be  arbitrary  ;  not  as  not  having  good and  sufficient  reasons  behind  it,  but  as  impelled  by  such  reasons as  are  either  beyond  human  apprehension  or  are  withheld  from  it in  God's  good  pleasure.  All  that  we  can  say  in  our  ignorance  of these  reasons  is :  Ood  did  thus  because  it  pleased  Him.  Certain  it is  that,  could  we  penetrate  to  these  reasons,  we  should  come,  in every  case,  at  last,  upon  perfect  wisdom  and  perfect  love,  working out  along  hidden  lines  to  such  results  as  will  fill  heaven  with  ador- ing joy  and  wonder.  THB  OOUBSB  OF  THB  ABOTJlCENTi  This  we  shall  follow  in  detail  through  cb.  ix.,  and  in  general  out- lines through  chs.  x.  and  xL  (w.  1-3.)  I  have  great  sorrow  of  heart  for  my  Jewish  kinsmen because  of  their  spiritual  condition  arising  from  their  rejection  of   138  WOBD  STUDIES  IN  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT.  (Oh.  XL  JeeuH,  and  their  consequent  exclusion  from  the  blessings  of  Mes- siah's kingdom.  (4,  6.)  Thia  condition  ia  the  more  lamentable  because  of  their original  privileges  involved  in  Ck>d's  election  of  them  to  be  Hia chosen  people — adoption,  viflible  manifestations  of  God,  covenants, a  divine  legislation,  a  divinely  arranged  order  of  worship,  mes- sianic promises,  descent  from  the  revered  fathers,  selection  as  the race  from  whom  the  Christ  was  to  spring  (compare  Isa.  xlv,  3,  4).  (6.)  There  is,  however,  no  inconsistency  between  their  posses- sion of  these  original  privileges  and  their  present  exclusion.  The case  does  not  stand  so  as  that  God's  word  has  failed  of  fulfilment. Those  who  make  this  charge,  aasuming  that  tbey  are  entitled  to acceptance  with  God  on  the  mere  ground  of  descent,  are  to  remem- ber the  general  principle  that  messianic  blessing  is  not  conditioned by  mere  descent ;  that  not  all  who  are  phyaicaily  descended  from Israel  are  the  true,  ideal  Israel  of  God  (compare  Bom.  iii.  28).  (7-9.)  This  appears  from  the  history  of  the  patriarchal  lineage. Though  Abraham  had  two  sons,  Ishmael  and  Isaac,  Isaac  was selected  as  the  channel  of  the  messianic  seed  of  Abraham,  according to  the  promise,  \"  In  Isaac  shall  thy  seed  be  called  \"  (compare  Gal. iv.  23),  and  not  Ishmael,  who  was  the  child  of  Abraham  in  a  physic- al sense  merely,  and  not  the  child  of  the  promise  which  is  recorded in  Gen.  xviii.  10.  (10-13.)  Not  only  have  we  an  example  of  divine  selection  in  the casa  of  children  of  different  mothers,  but  we  have  an  example  in the  case  of  the  children  of  the  same  mother.  Between  Jacob  and Esau,  representatives  of  the  two  nations  of  Israel  and  Bklom  (Gen. sxv.  23),  a  divine  choice  was  mode,  and  it  was  declared  by  God that  the  elder  should  serve  the  younger.  This  choice  was  not  based upon  purity  of  descent,  since  both  children  were  by  the  aame  father and  lawful  mother.  Nor  was  it  based  upon  moral  superiority, since  it  was  made  before  they  had  done  eitlier  good  or  evil  The choice  was  made  according  to  God's  sovereign  will,  so  that  Hia messianic  purpose  might  remain  intact ;  the  characteristic  of  which purpose  was  that  it  was  ficconling  to  election  ;  that  is,  not  determ- ined by  ment  or  descent,  but  by  the  sovereign  pleasure  of  God.  (14.)  If  it  be  asked,  therefore.  \"Is  there  unrighteousness  with God  ?    Does  God  contradict  Himself  in  His  rejection  of  unbeliev   Ch.  XL]  THE  EPISTLB  TO  THE  BOMAN&  189  ing  Israel?\"— it  must  be  answered,  \"No!\"  If  there  was  no unrighteousness  in  the  exclusion  of  Ishmael  and  Edom  from  the temporal  privileges  of  the  chosen  people,  there  is  none  in  the exclusion  of  the  persistently  rebellious  Israelites  from  the  higher privileges  of  the  kingdom  of  heaven.  If  not  all  the  physical descendants  of  Abraham  and  Isaac  can  claim  their  father's  name and  rights,  it  follows  that  Gk>d's  promise  is  not  violated  in  exclud- ing from  His  kingdom  a  portion  of  the  descendants  of  Jacob. Descent  cannot  be  gleaded  against  God's  right  to  exclude,  since He  has  already  excluded  from  the  messianic  line  without  regard  to descent  This  choice  Israel  approved  and  cannot,  therefore,  repud- iate it  when  the  same  choice  and  exclusion  are  applied  to  unbe- lieving Israel  Gbd  is  not  restricted  to  the  Hebrew  race,  nor bound  by  the  claims  of  descent  As  He  chose  between  the  chOd- ren  of  the  flesh  and  the  children  of  the  promise,  so  He  may  choose between  mere  descendants  and  true  believers,  whether  Jew  or Gentile.  It  is  to  be  remarked  on  this  passage  that  the  matter  of  eternal, individual  salvation  or  pretention  is  not  contemplated  in  the  argu- ment, as  it  is  not  in  MaL  L  2,  3,  from  which  the  words  \"  Jacob have  I  loved,\"  etc.,  are  quoted.  The  matter  in  question  is  the  part played  by  the  two  nations  regarded  from  the  theocratic  stand- point  (15.)  God  cannot  be  unrighteous.  This  is  apparent  from  your own  Scriptures,  which,  as  you  admit,  glorify  Gk>d's  righteousness, and  which  give  you  God's  own  statements  concerning  Himself  in the  cases  of  Moses  and  Pharaoh.  There  can,  therefore,  be  no  dis- crepancy between  God's  righteousness  and  the  principle  for  which I  am  contending,  since  Gk>d  represents  Himself  as  acting  on  this very  principle ;  Divine  choice  is  not  founded  upon  human  desert. Man  has  no  right  to  Ood' a  favors.  For  when  Moses  asked  God  to show  him  His  glory,  Qod,  in  complying,  assured  him  that  He  did not  grant  the  request  on  the  ground  of  Moses'  merit  or  services, but  solely  of  His  own  free  mercy.  He  would  have  mercy  and  com- passion upon  whom  He  would.  Moses  had  no  claim  upon  that revelation.  (16.)  Thus  it  appears  that  the  divine  bestowment  proceeds  from sovereign  grace,  and  not  from  the  will  or  the  effort  of  the  recipient   140  WORD   STDDIES    IN    THE   NEW  TESTAMENT.  ICa.  XL  Hence  the  Jew  cannot  claim  it  on  the  ground  of  race  or  of  moi-a] striTiog.  It  is  right  to  ivish  and  right  to  run.  Paul  elaewhere  aaya,  \"So run  that  ye  may  obtain  \"  (1  Cor.  ix.  24),  But  that  is  iiot  now  the point  in  riew.  The  point  is  to  emphasize  the  fact  of  God's  sovereign right  to  dispenae  Hia  favora  aa  He  will,  in  opposition  to  the  Jew's claim  that  God  iiiuHt  dit>peuae  His  favors  to  him  on  the  ground  of his  descent  Hence  the  argument  bears  alao  on  the  divine  dealing with  the  Qentilea.  The  Jew  says,  \"  The  Jewa  alone  are  subjects  of the  divine  mercy ;  the  Gentiles  are  excluded.\"  Paul  replies,  \"  Tour own  Scripturea  show  j'ou  that  God  has  the  right  to  ahow  mercy  to whom  He  will  The  fact  that  He  originally  did  not  chooae  the Gentile,  but  chose  the  Jew,  doea  not  exclude  Him  from  extending Hia  aalvation  to  the  Gentile  if  Ho  so  wilL  The  fact  that  He  did  ao chooae  the  Jew,  doea  not  aave  the  Jew  from  the  peril  of  exclusion and  rejection.\"  (17.)  A.gain,  God  ia  vindicated  against  the  charge  of  iujuatice  by Hia  declaration  of  the  same  principle  applied  to  the  matter  of  with- holding  mercy  in  the  case  of  Fbaraoh.  The  one  statement  impliea the  other.  The  right  to  beatow  at  will  implies  the  right  to  with- hold at  will.  Thus  He  aaya  to  Pharaoh  that  He  has  raiaed  him  up in  order  to  ahow  Hia  power  through  hia  defeat  and  deatruction.  (18.)  Hence  the  concluaion,  God  has  the  absolute  right  to  dia- pense  or  to  withhold  mercy  at  pleasure.  \"He  hath  mercy  upon whom  He  will  have  mercy,  and  whom  He  will  He  hardeneth.\"  Thia  last  statement,  on  its  face,  appears  to  be  the  assertion  of  a rigid,  inexorable  predeterminiam.  But  let  it  be  at  once  said  that Paul  commits  himself  to  no  such  theory.  For  to  interpret  this  pas- sage ns  meaning  that  God  takes  deliberate  measures  to  harden  any man  against  holy  and  gracious  iuflueucea,  ao  as  to  encourage  him to  sin  in  order  that  He  may  show  Hia  power  in  destroying  him,  Is :  L  To  ascribe  to  God  the  most  monstrous  cruelty  and  injustice, according  to  the  standard  of  Hia  own  revealed  character  and law.  2.

The  key-uote  ut  the  discuBsion  must  be  kept  clearly  in  mind  aa Bhaping  this  particular  form  of  atatemeot.  To  repeat :  Paul  is strikiug  sharply  at  the  osBumption  of  the  Jew  that  God  munt  dis- pense mesaianic  blessing  to  him,  and  muM  not  exclude  him,  he- cause  he  is  a  Jew.  Paul  meets  this  with  the  hare  statement  of God's  sovereign  right  to  dispose  of  men  aa  He  will.  He  does  not ignore  the  efforts  which  God  mokes  to  save  men  from  blindness and  hardness  of  heart,  but  the  attitude  of  the  Jew  does  not  call for  the  assertion  of  these  :  ouly  for  the  assertion  of  God's  absolute Borereigntj  against  an  iusolent  and  presumptuous  claim.  Bearing  this  in  mind,  we  are  here  confronted  with  n  class  of  facts which  we  cannot  explain — certain  arrangements  the  reasons  for which  lie  back  in  the  sovereign  will  of  God.  Moses  was  placed  uu- der  circumstances  which  promoted  his  becoming  the  leader  and lawgiver  of  God's  people.  Pharaoh  was  bom  to  an  inheritance  of despotic  power  and  inhaled  from  his  birth  the  traditions  of  Oiient- nl  tyranny.  These  influences  went  to  harden  him  against  God's command.  Apparently  the  circumstances  favored  Pharaoh's  he- coming  a  cruel  tyrant.  Why  the  difference  ?  We  cannot  tell. These  causes  operated  acconHng  to  their  natural  law.  There  was also  the  operation  of  a  psychological  and  moral  law,  according  to which  the  indulgence  of  any  evil  passion  or  impulse  confirms  it and  fosters  its  growth.  Pride  begets  pride ;  resistance  intensifies obstinacy,  encourages  presumption,  blunts  susceptibihty  to  bett«r influences.  Again,  the  penal  element  entered  into  the  case.  Per- sistent disobedience  and  resistance,  working  their  natural  result  of inflated  pride  and  presumptuous  foolhardineas,  wrought  out  a  con- dition of  heart  which  invited  and  insured  judgment.  A  parallel  is found  in  the  first  chapter  of  this  epistle,  where  it  is  said  that  the heathen,  having  a  certain  revelation  of  God,  refused  to  improve  it ; wherefore,  as  they  did  not  like  to  retain  God  in  their  knowledge, God  gave  them  up  to  uncleanness,  vile  passions,  and  a  reprobate mind  (i.  24,  26,  28).

God  does  not  make  men in  order  to  destroy  them.  God  ordaioa  no  man  to  eternal  death. He  desires  to  honor  humanity,  not  to  dishonor  It ;  and  the  fact that  men  do  become  vessels  unto  dishonor,  merely  proves  the power  which  God  boa  lodged  in  the  human  will  of  modifying,  and in  a  aense  defeating,  Hia  sovereign  purpose  of  love.  He  \"  will have  all  men  to  be  saved  and  come  to  a  knowledge  of  the truth;\"  yet  Christ  cornea  to  His  own,  and  Hia  own  receive  Him not,  aud  He  weeps  as  He  exclaims,  \"  Te  will  not  come  unto  me that  ye  might  have  life.\"  (22.)  The  argument  now  proceeds  in  regular  course  from  ver.  18, flhowiug  that  the  exercise  of  God's  sovereign  right  ia  marked  by mercy  even  toward  those  who  deserve  His  wrath.  Are  you  diij- poaed  to  construe  the  words  \"  whom  He  will  He  hardeneth  \"  into an  assertion  of  the  arbitrary,  relentless,  and  unjust  severity  of dod?  Suppose  it  can  be  shown  that  Gk>d,  though  the  spontan- eous  recoil  of  His  holy  nature  from  sin  moved  Him  to  display  Hia wrath  and  make  known  Hia  power  againat  men  who  were  fit  for  de- atxuction — endured  these  with  much  long-suffering.

What  hoe  Israel  to  aay  ?  The  word  of  God  has  not  been  brought to  nought  by  his  rejection.  The  principle  of  divine  selection  which operated  in  Abraham  and  Jacob  is  carried  out  in  the  selection  of believing  Isriiel  from  the  unbelieving  mass,  and  in  the  call  of  the Gentiles.  The  elective  purpose  of  Goil  was  broader  than  Israel thought  In  choosing  Israel  God  was  contemplating  the  salvation of  the  world,  and  did  not  abdicate  His  liberty  to  reject  unbelievers, or  to  call  others  not  Jews.  With  this  should  be  compared  the  discourse  of  Jesus  in  John  vL After  having  given  a  sign  of  His  divine  power  and  commission  by the  feeding  of  the  multitudes.  His  announcement  of  Himself  as  the bread  from  heaven,  the  true  and  only  life  of  the  world,  is  met  with a  stupid,  materiuliatic  construction  of  Hia  words,  and  with  obstin- ate incredulity ;  whereupon  He  says,  \"  Ye  also  have  seen  me  and believe  not \"  (ver.  36).  At  this  point  He  seems  to  pause  and  con- template His  failure  to  roach  the  Jews,  and  to  ask  Himself  if  His indeed  for  nought  It  is  the  answer  to  this  inward question  which  exphuns  the  apparent  disconnection  of  ver.  37  with what  precedes.  Though  the  Jews  reject,  yet  God  will  have  a people  for  Himself.  \"  All  that  the  Father  giveth  me  shall  come to  me.\"  There  is  a  clear  foreshadowing  here  of  the  call  of  the Gentiles.  (25,  26.)  But  not  only  is  God's  word  not  annulled  ;  it  is  ful- filled. For  He  says,  by  the  prophet  Hosea,  that  He  will  call  by  the name  my  peoph  those  who  are  not  His  people,  and  that  nation beloved  which  was  not  beloved  ;  and  in  the  Gentile  lands,  where Ck>d,  hj  tlie  punishment  of  exile,  said  to  Israel,  \"  Ye  are  not  my   d   Cu.  XI.]  THB  EPISTLE  TO  THB  ROHAN&  149  people,\"  there  Qod  would  visit  them  and  recall  them  along  with the  Gentiles.  Here  the  apostle  applies  to  the  Gentiles  what  Hosea  said  of  the Jews  only.  The  tribes,  by  their  lapse  into  idolatry,  had  placed themselves  on  the  same  footing  with  the  Gbntiles  (not  His  people), so  that  the  general  truth  could  be  appUed  to  both.  In  Isaiah xlix.  22,  the  Gentiles  are  represented  as  restored  to  grace  along with  the  Jews.  (27-29.)  But  this  people  shall  not  consist  of  Gentiles  only ;  for God  says  by  Isaiah  that  a  remnant  shall  be  preserved  out  of  Israel, a  small  number  out  of  the  great  unbeHeving  mass»  which  shall  at- tain to  the  salvation  and  privileges  of  the  messianic  kingdom :  a remnant,  for  Qod  in  His  righteous  judgment  wiU  make  a  summary reckoning  with  the  Jewish  nation,  and  the  great  body  of  it  shall  be cut  o£f ;  but  a  remnant  shall  be  left  as  a  seed  by  which  the  true  peo- ple of  Qod  shall  be  perpetuated.  This  preservation  of  a  remnant  is a  mark  of  divine  mercy.  But  for  this,  the  whole  nation  would have  been  destroyed  like  Sodom.  (30.)  Paul  now  turns  to  the  facts  of  human  agency,  moral  free- dom, and  consequent  responsibility,  which,  up  to  this  point,  have been  kept  in  the  shadow  of  the  truth  of  divine  sovereignty.  There is  a  correspondence  between  God's  freedom  in  His  government  and the  freedom  of  men  in  their  faith  and  unbelief.  He  summarily states  the  truth  which  he  develops  in  ch.  x. ;  namely,  that  Israel  toas the  cause  of  Us  own  rejection,  alluding  at  the  same  time  incidentally to  the  cause  of  the  Gfrentiles*  reception.  The  reason  why  the  Jews  were  rejected  was  because  they  did  not seek  after  the  righteousness  which  is  by  faith,  but  dung  to  the  law, and  sought  to  be  justified  by  its  worka  The  Gentiles,  who  had  no revelation,  and  who  therefore  did  not  seek  after  righteousness  in the  New-Testament  sense,  nevertheless  attained  it^  accepting  it when  it  was  offered,*  and  not  being  hindered  by  the  legal  bigotry and  pretension  of  the  Jew ;  but  Israel,  following  after  the  law, which,  in  itself,  is  holy  and  just  and  good,  and  which  was  intended to  lead  to  Christ,  pursued  it  only  as  an  external  standard  of  right- eousness, and  on  the  side  of  legal  observance,  and  so  found  a  stumb- li Tig-block  in  the  very  Messiah  to  whom  it  led  them.  *  Godet  compares  the  parable  of  the  man  fiudiiig  treasure  hid  iu  the  field.   WORD   STUDIES   IN  THE   NEW   TESTAMENT.   Ohaptbb  X.  Tbe  general  statement  in  ix.  30-33  is  developed.  (1-3.)  Israel  woB  zealous  fur  God,  but  without  diBcemment  ot tlie  true  meaning  luiiJ  t«DdeDCy  of  the  law.  Hence,  iu  the  endeavor to  establish  its  own  legal  righteoiisnesa,  it  missed  the  rigbteous- neaa  of  faith,  tbe  nature  of  which  is  expounded  iu  this  epistle.  (1-11.)  They  did  not  perceive  that  Christ  briugs  tbe  legal  dis- pensation to  aa  end  iu  ititroducing  Himself  as  tbe  object  of  faith and  tbe  source  of  justifyLug  righteousness.  They  accepted  onlj the  declaration  of  Moaes  concerning  righteousness,  that  tbe  man who  keeps  tbe  law  shall  Uve  bj  it,  and  did  not  see  that  the  law, properly  understood,  implied  also  the  work  of  grace  and  depend- ence on  God.  They  regarded  righteousneBB  as  aomething  remote and  to  be  attained  only  by  laborious  effort ;  whereas  even  Moses would  have  told  them  that  Jehovah's  help  was  near  at  band  to  as- sist them  iu  tbe  daily  understanding  and  keeping  of  the  law.  No one  need  be  sent  to  heaven  nor  beyond  tbe  aea  to  bring  back  tbe explanation  of  its  commandments,  or  to  enable  them  to  fulfil  them. Still  more  plainly,  to  the  same  effect,  spoke  tbe  righteousness  of faith  in  Christ,  No  need  to  ascend  to  heaven  to  bring  Him  down. He  has  already  descended  to  earth.  No  need  to  dive  into  the depths  of  the  earth  to  bring  Him  up.  He  baa  already  risen  from the  dead.  They  have  only  to  actrept  by  faith  His  death  and  hie resurrection,  and  to  confess  Him  who  has  accompliabed  In  Himself the  two  great  things  which  needed  to  be  done.  Such  faith  shall  not put  them  to  shame.  They  shall  be  saved  as  if  they  bad  fulfilled  all I  he  necessary  conditions  themselves.  (12,  13.)  Not  only  is  this  salvation /ree.  It  is  also  umuersai, to  whosoever  shall  believe.  T)jus  it  appeals  to  the  Gentile  no  less than  to  the  Jew.  It  strikes  at  the  notion  that  the  Jew  alone  is  tbe subject  of  messianic  salvation  ;  that  the  Gentile  must  enter  tbe kingdom  through  the  gate  of  Judaism.  Both  Jew  and  Gentile enter  through  faith  only.  There  is  no  difference  between  the  Jew and  tbe  Gentile.  Tbe  Lord,  who  is  Lord  of  both  alike,  dispenses His  riches  to  all  of  both  nations  who  call  upon  Him.  (14-21.)  The  Jew  cannot  plead  in  excuse  for  rejecting  this  sal-   Ch.  XL]  THB  EPISTLE  TO  THE  ROMA1I8.  151  vation,  either  that  he  has  not  heard  it  announoed,  or  that  its  ani« vers»ality  is  inconsistent  with  Old-Testament  teaching.  Both  ex- cuses are  shattered  upon  Old-Testament  dedarationa  It  was  pro- phesied by  Isaiah  that  Israel  would  not  all  submit  themselves  to the  Gospel  The  good  tidings  has  been  proclaimed,  but  they  have not  believed  the  report  Faith  comes  by  hearing,  and  they  have heard  the  Gbspel  in  their  cities  and  synagogues.*  Had  Israel  any reason  to  be  surprised  at  the  universality  of  the  Gk>8pel — its  pro- clamation to  the  Gentiles  ?  On  the  contrary,  did  not  Israel  know  ? Had  not  Moses  and  Isaiah  prophesied  that  God  would  manifest  His grace  to  the  Gentiles,  and  that  the  Gentiles  would  receive  it — yea, that  through  the  Gentiles  Israel  should  be  brought  back  to  Gk>d  ? Did  not  Isaiah  prophesy  that,  notwithstanding  God's  long-suffer- ing and  entreaty,  Israel  would  prove  a  disobedient  and  gainsaying nation  ?  Thus  the  argument  is,  Israel  is  responsible  for  its  own  rejection. In  blind  reliance  on  its  original  election,  it  has  claimed  a  monopoly of  divine  favor,  has  made  a  stand  for  legal  righteousness,  and  has rejected  the  gospel  message  of  salvation  by  faith.  It  has  thus  re- pelled the  offer  of  a  free  and  un%\\XT9al  salvation.  For  this  it  is without  excuse.  It  was  warned  by  its  own  Scriptures  of  the  danger of  being  superseded  by  the  Gentiles,  and  the  salvation  of  Christ was  offered  to  it  along  with  the  Gentiles  by  Christ's  mini8ter&  Chapter  XL  In  ch.  ix.  it  is  shown  that  when  Gk)d  elected  Israel  He  did  not fibjure  the  right  to  reject  them  for  good  reason.

X.  this  reason  is  shown  to  be  their  unbeliel  The  question  now  arises  :  1%  this  rejection  complete  and  forever  f Paul  proceeds  to  show  that  the  rejection  is  not  total,  but  partial ; not  eternal,  but  temporary  ;  and  that  it  shall  subserve  the  salva- tion of  mankind  and  of  the  Israelitish  nation  itsell  (2-6.)  From  the  history  of  Elijah  be  shows  how,  in  the  midst of  general  moral  defection  and  decline,  Gk>d  preserved  a  remnant  of faithful  ones  ;  and  declares  that  the  same  is  true  at  the  present  time.  In  virtue  of  His  free  grace  displayed  in  His  original  election,  God  *  Compare  John  vi  44.   \\   152  WORD  STUDIES  IN  THE  KEW  TB8TAMENT.  [Cil  XI.  hae  not  left  the  nation  without  a  believing  remnant.  The  elective purpose  holds,  though  operating  in  a  way  different  from  larael's ■vuiu  and  narrow  conception  of  its  nature  aud  extent  The  preser- vation of  this  remnant  is  a  matter  of  God's  fiee  grace,  not  of  In- rael's  merit  (T'lO.)  The  case  then  stands  that  Israel  has  not  attained  the righteouanesB  which  it  sought  (in  the  wrong  way),  but  tiie  chosen remnant  has  attained  it,  while  the  great  mass  of  the  nation  was blinded  according  to  the  prophesy  in  Isaiah  xxix.  and  Psalm  Ixtx.  It  is  to  be  observed  that,  in  those  very  chapters,  the  full  respon- dbility  of  those  who  are  punished  is  asserted  ;  aud  that,  in  citing the  Paalm,  Paul  renders  the  Hebrew/or  Iho.ie  toko  are  in  security by  the  worda/or  a  recompense,  thus  indicating  a  just  retribution.  (11,  12.)  The  rejection  of  the  Jews,  however,  is  not  total  nor final,  and  it  works  for  two  ulterior  ends  :  first,  the  conversion  of the  Oentile  ;  second,  the  restoration  of  the  Jews  by  means  of  the converted  Oen tiles.  (13-15.)  Hence  Paul  labors  the  more  earnestly  for  the  Genliles, with  B.  view  to  promote  the  salvation  of  his  own  race.  (lG-24.)  The  Gentiles,  however,  are  warned  against,  entertain- ing contempt  for  the  Jews  on  account  of  their  own  position  in the  messianic  kingdom.  However  lapsed,  Israel  still  retains  the character  of  God's  holy  nation  impressed  iu  its  original  call ; and  this  original  call,  represented  in  the  fathere,  implies  its  future restoration.  So  far  from  despising  them,  the  Gentiles  are  to  re- member that  they  themselves  are  not  the  origiu:d  stock,  but  outy a  graft ;  aud  to  take  warning  by  the  history  of  Israel,  that  tlje called  may  he  rejected,  and  that  they,  by  unbelief,  disobedience, and  rebellion,  may,  like  Israel,  forfeit  their  high  privilege.  \"  If  God spared  not  the  natural  branches,  take  heed  lest  He  also  spare  not thee,\"  \"  Behold,  therefore,  the  goodness  and  aeverity  of  God  :  on them  which  fell,  severity,  but  toward  thee  goodness,  if  thou  conliniie in  His  goodness ;  otherwise  thou  also  shall  6«  cut  off\"'  Israel,  too, shall  be  restored  to  its  place  in  God's  kingdom,  grafFed  in  again, if  they  continue  not  in  nnbdifif;  much  more,  since  they  are  natural branches,  and  the  tree  is  their  own  native  stock.  (25-32.)  Tlius,  then,  the  plan  of  (rod  shall  work  H self  out :  the purpose,  so  much  of  which  was  enshrouded  in  mystery,  shall  at   Ch.

Through  the  Gentile,  Is- rael shall  attain  the  righteousness  of  faith  in  the  Deliverer  out  of Zion.  Qod  has  made  no  mistake.  He  does  not  repent  His  origi- nal call,  nor  the  displays  of  His  divine  grace  to  Israel,  nor  the special  aptitudes  with  which  He  endowed  it,  in  order  to  make  it the  special  vehicle  of  His  salvation.  Jew  and  G^tile  have  alike been  unbelievers  and  disobedient,  but  the  unbelief  of  both  has been  overruled  to  the  inclusion  of  both  in  Qod*B  messianic  king- dom.

The word  is  appropriate  to  the  image  which  follows,  in  which  Paul represents  himself  as  the  marriage-friend  who  has  betrothed the  bride  to  the  bridegroom,  and  consequently  shares  the  bride- groom's jealousy  of  his  bride  (see  on  John  iii.  29).

The  compound  verb  used  here  occurs in  Hippocrates  in  the  sense  of  growi/ng  quite  stiff.

Now  )ie  . superiority,^^!  more;\"  and  ironically  characterizes  this  si ment  from  their  stand-point  as  madness.  Mo Rev.  Stripes  above  measure  (vTrepiSaXXaWo?).  Ttiis  peculiar form  of  suffering  is  emphasized  by  details.  He  specifies  three Roman  scourginga,  and  five  at  the  hands  of  the  Jews.  Of  the former,  only  one  is  recorded,  that  at  Philippi  (Acts  xvi.  22,  23. See  on  Acts  xxii.  25),  and  none  of  the  latter.  Tlie  Jewish scourge  consisted  of  two  thongs  made  of  calf's  or  ass's  skin, passing  through  a  hole  in  a  handle.  Thirteen  blows  were  in- flicted on  the  breast,  thirteen  on  the  right,  and  thirteen  on  the left  shoulder.  The  law  in  Deut.  xxv.  3  permitted  forty  blows, but  only  tUirty-nino  were  given,  in  order  to  avoid  a  possible miscount.  During  the  punishment  the  chief  judge  read  aloud Dent,  xxviii.  58,  5ft ;  Deut.  xxix.  9 ;  Ps.  Ixviii.  38,  39.  The possibility  of  death  under  the  infliction  was  contemplated  in the  provision  which  exonerated  the  executioner  unless  he  should exceed  the  legal  number  of  blows.  Paul  escaped  Roman  scoui^- ingat  Jerusalem  on  the  ground  of  his  Roman  citizenship.  It is  not  related  that  he  and  Silas  urged  this  privilege  at  Philippi nntil  after  the  scourging.  It  is  evident  from  the  narrative  that they  were  not  allowed  a  formal  hearing  before  the  magistrates  ■ and,  if  they  asserted  their  citizenship,  it  may  have  been  that their  voices  were  drowned  by  the  mob.

See  on  Mark  ii.  26,  Paul  refers not  to  preaching,  but  to  the  work  of  atonement  itself,  in  which God'e  righteousness  is  displayed.  Some  render  purposed  or determine,  as  Horn.  1. 13 ;  £ph.  i.  9,  and  according  to  the  usual meaning  of  irpo^aK purpose,  in  t!ie  New  Testament.  But  the meaning  adopted  here  is  Sxed  by  to  declare.  Propitiation  (tXcumjpiov).  This  word  is  most  important, since  it  is  the  key  to  the  conception  of  Olirist's  atoning  work.  In  the  New  Testament  it  occurs  only  here  and  Heb.  ix.  5; and  must  be  studied  in  connection  with  the  following  kindred words:  iKdvKOfLOi  which  occurs  in  the  Kew  Testament  only Luke  sriiL  13,  God  be  Tnervifal.,  and  Heb.  ii.  17,  to  make  reofm~ ciliation.

'IXdaKOfuu,  which  is  comparatively  rare,  occurs  as  a  transla- tion of  kipher  lo  cover  sin,  Ps.  Ixiv.  3;  Ixxvii.  38;  Ixxviii. 9 ;  A.  v.,  purge  away,  forgive,  pardon.

'E^iXaaxofuu  mostly  represents  kipker  to  cover,  and  is  more common  than  the  simple  verh.  Thus,  purge  the  altar,  Ezek. xliii.  26;  cleanse  the  sanctuary,  Ezek.  xlv.  20;  reconcile  the house,  Dan.  ix.  24.

There  are  but  two instances  of  the  accusative  of  the  person  propitiated  :  appease AiTM,  Gen.  xxxii.  20;  pray  before  (propitiate)  the  Zord,  Zech, vii.  2.  'I\\a<rr^piov,  A.  V.,  propitiation,  is  almost  always  used  in  the Old  Testairient  of  the  mercy-seat  or  golden  cover  of  the  ark, and  this  is  its  meaning  in  Heb.  ix.  5,  t!ie  only  other  passage  of the  New  Testament  in  which  it  is  found.

This  term  has  been  intdiily  pressed  into  the  sense  of  e.rpia- tory  sacrljlce.  In  the  case  of  the  kindred  verbs,  the  dominant Old-Testament  sense  is  not  propitiation  in  the  sense  of  some- thing offered  to  placate  or  appease  anger;  bnt  atonement  or reconciliation,  iiiTO\\i^\\  i\\\\Q  covering,  aaA  bo  getting  rid  of  the   k   Cit  IIL)   THE  EPISTLE  TO  THE  ROMANS.   sin  which  Btands  between  God  and  man.

Compare  Lev.  xvi.  20,  The  Hebrew  terms  are  also uned  coordinately.  Oar  tranalatora  frequently  render  the  verb  kc^har  by  recon- cile. Lev.  vi.  30 ;  xvi.  20 ;  Ezek.  xlv,  20.  Ia  Lev.  viii.  15, Moses  put  blood  upon  the  horns  of  the  altar  and  cleansed  {ixaS- dpurt)  the  altar,  and  sanctijled  {fulaaev)  it,  to  make  reconcUi- atinn  (tov  i^tXtia-aa^at)  upon  it  Compare  Ezek.  xlv.  15,  17; Dan.  ix.  24.  The  verb  and  its  derivatives  occur  where  the  ordinary  idea of  expiation  is  excluded.  As  applied  to  an  altar  or  to  the walls  of  a  house  {Lev.  xiv.  4S-53j,  this  idea  conid  have  no force,  because  these  inanimate  things,  though  ceremonially  un- clean, could  have  no  sin  to  be  expiated,  Moses,  when  he  went up  to  make  atonement  for  the  idolatry  at  Sinai,  offered  no  sac- rifice, but  only  intercession.  See  also  the  case  of  Korah,  Num. xvi.  46  ;  the  cleansing  of  leprosy  and  of  mothers  after  child- birth, Lev.  xiv,  1-20;  xii.  7;  xv.  30;  the  reformation  of Josiah,  2  Chron.  xxxiv. ;  the  fasting  and  confession  of  Ezra, Ezra  X.  1-15  ;  the  offering  of  the  Israelite  army  after  the  de- feat of  Midian.  They  brought  bracelets,  rings,  etc.,  to  make  an atonement  {e^iXatraaSai)  before  the  Lord ;  not  expiatory,  but  a memorial.  Num.  xxxi.  50-54.  The  Passover  was  in  no  sense expiatory  ;  but  Paul  says,  \"  Christ  our  Passover  was  sacrificed for  ns ;  therefore  purge  out  (eKKa^part)  the  old  leaven.  Let us  keep  the  feast  with  sincerity  and  tnUh  ;\"  1  Cor.  v.  7,  8.  In  the  Old  Testament  the  idea  of  sacrifice  as  in  itself  a  pro- pitiation continually  ret^edes  before  that  of  the  personal  char- acter lying  back  of  sacrifice,  and  which  alone  gives  virtue  to  it. See  1  Sam.  xv.  22 ;  Fs.  xl.  6-10  ;  1.  8-14,  23  ;  li.  16,  17 ;  Isa. i.  11-18;  Jer.  vii.  21-23;  Amos  v.  21-24;  Mic,  vi,  6-8.     Thia   46  WORD  STDDLES  IN  THE  NEW   TESTAMENT.  [Cii.  IIL  idea  does  not  recede  in  tbe  Old  Testament  to  be  re-emphaBized in  the  New.  On  the  contrary,  tbe  New  Testament  emp)iaaizes the  recession,  and  laye  tbe  strese  upon  tbe  cleansing  and  life- giving  effect  of  tlie  sacrifice  of  Christ.  See  Jobn  i.  29;  Col.  i. 20-22 ;  Heb.  i.\\.  14 ;  x.  19-21 ;  1  Pet.  ii.  24 ;  1  John  i.  7 ;  iv. 10-13.  Tlie  true  meaning  of  the  offering  of  Christ  concentrates, therefore,  not  npon  divine  justice,  bat  upon  kuinan  character  ; not  upon  tbe  remission  of  penalty  for  a  consideration,  but npon  tlie  deliverance  from  penalty  tbrongli  moral  transform- ation; not  upon  satisfying  divine  justice,  but  upon  bring- ing estranged  man  into  harmony  with  God.  As  Canon  Weet- cott  remarks :  \"  The  scripture  conception  of  iKaaKcaSai  is  not tliat  of  appeasing  one  who  is  angry  with  a  personal  feeling against  tbe  offender,  but  of  altering  tbe  character  of  that  which, from  without,  occasions  a  necessary  alienation,  and  interposes an  inevitable  obstacle  to  feUowsliip\"  (Commentary  on  St, John's  Epistles,  p.  85).  In  the  light  of  this  conception  we  are  brought  back  to  that rendering  of  iKa/rrripiov  which  prevails  in  the  Septuagint,  and which  it  has  in  the  only  other  New-Testament  passage  where it  occurs  (Ileb.  is.  5) — mercy-seat ;  a  rendering  maintained  by a  lai^e  number  of  tbe  earlier  expositors,  and  by  some  of  tbe ablest  of  the  moderns.  That  it  is  the  sole  instance  of  its  occur- rence in  this  sense  is  a  fact  which  has  its  parallel  in  tbe  terms J-'assowr,  Dooi,  Rock,  A-men,  Day-sjrrintj.  and  others,  applied to  Clirist.  To  say  that  the  metaphor  is  awkward  counts  for nothing  in  the  light  of  other  metaphors  of  Paul.  To  say  that the  concealment  of  the  ark  is  inconsistent  with  set  forth  is  to adduce  the  strongest  argument  in  favor  of  this  rendering.  The contrast  with  set  forth  falls  in  perfectly  with  the  general  con- ception. That  mercy-seat  which  was  veiled,  and  which  the Jew  could  approach  oniy  once  a  year,  and  then  tiirongh  the medium  of  the  Iligh-Priest,  is  now  brought  out  where  all  can draw  nigh  and  experience  its  reconciling  power  (Heb.  x.  19, 22 ; compare  Heb.  tx.  8).  \"The  word  became  flesh  and  dwelt among  us.  We  beheld  His  glory.  We  saw  and  handled\" (John  i.  14  ;  1  John  i  1-3).     The  mercy-seat  was  the  meeting-   k   Cu.

Tliroiigli Christ,  the  antitype  of  the  mercy-seat,  the  Mediator,  man  liaB access  to  the  Father  (Eph.  ii.  18),  As  the  golden  surface covered  the  tables  of  the  law,  so  Christ  stands  over  the  law, vindicating  it  as  holy  and  just  and  good,  and  therewith  vindi- cating the  divine  claim  to  obedience  and  holiness.  As  the blood  was  annnally  sprinkled  on  the  golden  cover  by  the  Uigh- Priest,  so  Christ  is  set  forth  \"in  His  blood,\"  not  ehed  to  ap- pease God's  wrath,  to  satisfy  God's  justice,  nor  to  compensate  for man's  disobedience,  but  as  the  highest  expression  of  divine  love for  man,  taking  common  part  with  humanity  even  unto  death, that  it  might  reconcile  it  throngh  faith  and  self- surrender  to  God.  Through  faith.  Connect  with  propiti-ation  (mercy-seat). The  sacrifiee  of  Christ  becomes  effective  through  the  faith which  appropriates  it.  ^Reconciliation  implies  two  parties. \"  No  propitiation  reaches  the  mark  that  does  not,  on  its  way, reconcile  or  bring  into  faith,  the  subject  for  whom  it  is  made.

The  righteousness  of  God  here  is  not  Hia \"judicial\"  or  \"punitive\"  righteousness,  but  His  righteous character,  revealing  its  antagonism  to  sin  in  its  effort  to  save man  from  bis  sin,  and  put  forward  as  a  grouJid  of  mercy,  not as  an  obstacle  to  mercy.

It  is  not  found in  the  Septuagint  proper,  and  is  not  frequent  in  classical Greek,  where  it  is  used  of  a  holding  back  or  stojyping  of  hos- tilities; a  truce;  in  later  Greek,  ojwrmts«'on.  The  passage  has  given  much  trouble  to  expositors,  largely,  I think,  through  their  insisting  on  the  sense  of  forhearajice  with reference  to  sins — the  toleratio'i  or  refraining  from  punish- nkwii  o/\"*/*!*  done  aforetime.  But  it  is  a  fair  construction  of the  term  to  apply  it,  in  its  primary  sense  of  holding  hack,  to the  divine  method  of  dealing  with  gin.  It  cannot  be  said  that God  passed  over  the  sins  of  the  world  before  Christ  without penalty,  for  that  is  plainly  contradicted  by  Rom.  i.  18-32  ;  but He  did  pass  them  over  in  the  sense  that  He  did  not  apply,  but held  hack  the  redeeming  agency  of  God  manifest  in  the  flesh until  the  \"fulness  of  time.\"  The  sacrifices  were  a  homage rendered  to  God's  righteousness,  but  they  did  not  touch  sin with  the  power  and  depth  which  attached  to  Christ's  sacriflce. Ko  demonstration  of  God's  righteousness  and  consequent  hatred of  sin,  could  be  given  equal  to  that  of  the  life  and  death  of Jesus.  Hence  Paul,  as  I  take  it,  says :  God  set  forth  Christ  as the  world's  mercy-seat,  for  the  showing  forth  of  His  righleous- ness,  because  previously  lie  had  given  no  such  manifestation  of Uis  righteousness,  but  had  held  it  back,  passing  over,  with  the temporary  institution  of  sacrifices,  the  sin  at  the  roots  of  which He  finally  struck  in  the  sacrifice  of  Christ.  26.

It is  introduced  on  dogmatic  grounds,  and  implies  a  problem  in the  divine  nature  itself,  namely,  to  bring  God's  essential  justice into  consistency  witli  His  merciful  restoration  of  the  sinner. On  the  contrary,  the  words  are  coordinate — righteovs  and  mak- ing believers  righteous.  It  is  of  the  essence  of  divine  right- eousness to  bring  men  into  perfect  sympathy  with  itself.  Paul's object  is  not  to  show  fiow  God  is  vindicated^  but  how  man  is mad^  right  with  the  righteovs  Ood.  Theology  may  safely leave  God  to  take  care  for  the  adjustment  of  the  different  sides of  His  own  character.  The  very  highest  and  strongest  reason why  God  should  make  men  right  lies  in  His  own  righteousness. Because  He  is  righteous  He  must  hate  sin,  and  the  antagonism ean  be  removed  only  by  removing  iSi'Q  sin,  not  by  compounding it.

'Atroinepeiv  iavrov was  a  regular  phrase  for  separation  from  civic  life.

The  maidens  say:  \"May  King  Zeus  avert  the  hateful  mar- riage\" (Aeschylus,  \"Suppliants,\"  1063).  In  the  New  Testa- ment the  word  occurs  five  times.  In  Mark  x.  19,  defraud  not is  apparently  Mark'u  rendering  of  the  tenth  commandment. According  to  the  inner  meaning  of  the  commandment  as  con- ceived by  Jesus,  the  coveting  of  another's  goods  is,  in  heart,  a depriving  him  of  them.

Mar- riage was  regarded  as  a  duty  among  the  Jews,  so  that  a  man was  considered  to  have  sinned  if  he  had  reached  the  age  of twenty  without  marrying.  The  Mishna  fixed  the  age  of  mar- riage at  seventeen  or  eighteen,  and  the  Babylonish  Jews  as  early as  fourteen.  A  rabbinical  precept  declared  that  a  Jew  who has  no  wife  is  not  a  man.  It  is  not  certain,  but  most  probable, tliat  Saul  was  a  member  of  the  Sanhedrim  (Acts  xxvi.  10).   *  On  the  whole  question,  see  Sohaif.  \"  Historj  of  the  Apostolic  Chnrch,**  p. 448  sqq.  ;  *' Historj  of  the  Christian  Chnrch/'  ii.,  868  sqq.

Not  the  condition  or  oooiipationj  a meaning  which  the  word  does  not  have  in  classical  Greek,  nor in  the  New  Testament,  where  it  always  signifies  the  call  of  God into  His  kingdom  through  conversion.  Paul  means :  If  God's call  was  to  you  as  a  circumcised  man  or  as  an  uncircumcised man ;  as  a  slave  or  as  a  freedman — abide  in  that  condition. Compare  ch.  i.  26.  21.

Tiie  force  of  koI  even, and  the  positive  injunction  of  the  apostle  in  w.  20  and  24, seem  to  favor  the  meaning,  remain  in  slavery.*  The  injunc- tion is  to  be  read  in  the  light  of  ver.  22,  and  of  Gal.  iii.  28 ; Col,  iii.  11 ;  1  Cor.  xii.  13,  that  freeman  and  slave  are  one  in Christ;  and  also  of  the  feeling  pervading  the  Church  of  the speedy  termination  of  the  present  economy  by  the  second  com- ing of  the  Lord.

Not  the  unmarried  of  both  sexes, as  Bengcl,  The  nse  of  the  word  by  ecclesiastical  writers  for an  unmarried  man  has  no  warrant  in  classical  usage,  and  may have  arisen  from  the  misinterpretation  of  Apoc.  xiv.  4,  where it  is  employed  adjectivally  and  metaphorically.  In  every  other cage  in  the  New  Testament  the  meaning  is  nnquestionahle.  26.  The  present  distress  (t^h  hiea-rHiaav  ayay/crji').    'Eiw-  Toxrav present  may  also  express  fioniething  which  is  not  siniply present,  but  tiie  presence  of  whieli  foreshadows  and  inaugurates something  to  come.  Hence  it  may  be  rendered  impendiug  or aettiitg  in.  See  on  Bom.  viii.  38.  ^Avar/icq  means  originally force,  conalraint,  Tteceaaity,  and  this  is  its  usual  meaning  in classical  Greek ;  though  in  the  poets  it  sometimes  has  the  mean- ing of  distress,  anguish,  which  ia  very  common  in  Hellenistic   *  So  Edwards,  EUlootl,  Muver.

In  the  Attic  orators  it  occurs  in  the  sense  of  Uood- reUUionshvpy  like  the  Latin  necesaitudo  a  binding  tie.  In  this sense  never  in  the  New  Testament.  For  the  original  sense  of necessity^  see  Matt,  xviii.  7 ;  Luke  xiv.  18 ;  2  Cor.  ix.  7 ;  Heb. ix.  16.  For  distress^  Luke  xxi.  23 ;  1  Thess.  iii.  7.

The  meaning  is:  I  give  you  these  in- junctions in  order  to  spare  you  the  tribulation  of  the  flesh.  29.  Time  (Koipo^).

Rev.,  correctly,  giving  the  force  of the  participle,  shortened.  Compare  Mark  xiii.  20,  and  see  on hasting  untOj  2  Pet.  iii.  12.  The  word  means  to  draw  together or  contract.  Only  here  and  Acts  v.  6,  where  it  is  used  of  the winding  up  of  Ananias'  corpse.  In  classical  Oreek  of  furling sails,  packing  luggage,  reducing  expenses,  etc  Applied  to time,  the  word  is  very  graphic.  It  remaineth  that  {ro  XoittSv  tva).  The  meaning  is  rather henceforth^  or  for  the  future.  That  (S/a)  in  any  case  is  to  be construed  with  the  time  is  shortened.  According  to  the  punct- uation by  difiPerent  editors,  we  may  read  either :  the  lime  is shortened  that  henceforth  hoth  those^  etc. ;  or,  the  time  is  short- ened henceforth,  that  hoth  thosCy  etc.  The  former  is  preferable.* The  time  is  shortened  that  henceforth  Christians  may  hold earthly  ties  and  possessions  but  loosely.  *  So  Rer. ;  Weatoott  and  Hort,  Tiaohendorf,  Brown,  Mej«r,  EUioott,  Staiki lej.

The  repetition  of his  own  cmphaBizes  the  fact  lliat  the  disposal  of  t)ie  daughter lay  wholly  in  the  parent's  power.  Among  tlie  Greeks  and Romans  the  choice  of  a  wife  was  rarely  grounded  upon  affect- ion. In  many  cases  the  father  chose  for  his  son  a  wife  whom the  latter  had  never  seen,  or  compelled  him  to  marry  for  the sake  of  checking  his  extravagances.  Thus  Terence  pictures  a fatJier  meeting  his  son  in  the  forum,  and  saying,  \"  You  are  to  be married  to-day,  get  ready  \"  {\"  Andria,\"  i.,  5).  Nor  was  the  con- sent of  a  woman  generally  thouglit  necessary.  She  was  obliged to  submit  to  t!ie  wishes  of  her  parents,  and  perhaps  to  receive  a stranger.  Thus  Ilermione  says:  \"My  marriage  is  mj'  father's care:  it  is  not  for  me  to  decide  about  that\"  (Euripides,  \"  An- Iromache,\"  987).

After  the  Exile  the  parents  could  betroth  their  children,  while minors,  at  their  pleasure ;  but  when  they  became  of  age  their consent  was  required,  and  if  betrothed  during  minority,  they had  afterward  the  right  of  insisting  upon  divorce.  39.
