A. T. Robertson 


THIS SIX-VOLUME COMMENTARY on the 
New Testament was published in 
1930-33. Ministers and other Bible stu- 
dents still acclaim it for combining 
thorough scholarship with teaching 
skill and insight. 

“It is a verse by verse commentary 
on the English text (with the corre- 
sponding Greek in English letters) 
stressing those meaningful and _ picto- 
rial suggestions which are often im- 
plicit in the original significance of 
the words but are lost in translation. 
. . . The author makes available for 
those who do not know Greek a large 
amount of critical and exegetical ma- 
terial and of interpretative insight di- 
rectly connected with studies in the 
original text.”—The Christian Century 

Dr. Robertson’s scholarship was at 
all times unimpeachable, his spiritual 
insight was profound, and his style was 
of the highest order. His genial wit, his 
human touch and interest, and_ his 
unique phrasing carry an appeal for 
every reader.

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


Not a Happy TITLE 


There are various explanations of the term catholic (ka- 
tholikat epistolai) as applied to this group of seven short 
letters by four writers (one by James, two by Peter, one by 
Jude, three by John). The Latin for katholikos is generalis, 
though the Vulgate terms these letters Catholicae. The 
meaning is not orthodox as opposed to heretical or canon- 
ical, though they are sometimes termed Epistolae canonicae. - 
As a matter of fact five of the seven (all but First Peter and 
First John) Eusebius placed among the “disputed” (anfi- 
legomena) books of the New Testament. “A canonical book 
is primarily one which has been measured and tested, and 
secondarily that which is itself a measure or standard” 
(Alfred Plummer). Canon is from kanon (cane) and is like 
a yardstick cut to the right measure and then used as a 
measure. Some see in the term katholikos the idea that these 
Epistles are meant for both Jews and Gentiles, but the 
Epistle of James seems addressed to Jewish Christians. 
There were two other chief groups of New Testament writ- 
ings in the old Greek manuscripts (the Gospels and Acts, 
then the Epistles of Paul). This group of seven Epistles 
and the Apocalypse constitute the remainder of the New 
Testament. The usual interpretation of the term katholikos 
here is that these seven Epistles were not addressed to any 
particular church, but are general in their distribution. 
This is clearly true of I Peter, as is shown by the language 
in I Peter 1:1, where seven Roman provinces are mentioned. 
The language of II Peter 3:1 bears the same idea. Appar- 
ently the Epistle of Jude is general also as is I John. But 

x1 


xli BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


II John is addressed to “an elect lady” (verse 1) and III 
John to Gaius (verse 1), both of them individuals, and there- 
fore in no sense are these two brief letters general or catholic. 
The earliest instance of the word katholikos is in an inscrip- 
tion (B.c. 6) with the meaning “‘general” (427 katholikéi mou 
prothesei, my general purpose). It was common after that. 
The earliest example of it in Christian literature is in Igna- 
tius’ Epistle to the Church of Smyrna (VIII) where he has 
“the catholic church” (Aé@ katholiké ekklesia), “the general 
church,” not a local body. Clement of Alexandria (Strom. 
IV. xv) applies this adjective to the letter sent to the Gen- 
tile Christians “in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia” from the 
Jerusalem Conference (Acts 15:23). 


ORDER AND DATES 


The oldest Greek manuscripts give these General Epistles 
immediately after the Acts, and Westcott and Hort so print 
them in their Greek New Testament. But the English Ver- 
sions follow the Textus Receptus and put them just before 
the Apocalypse. The order of the seven letters varies 
greatly in the different manuscripts, though usually James 
comes first and Jude last (as the last accepted and the least 
known of the four authors). It is possible that the order of 
James, Peter, and John (omitting Jude) represented a sort 
of chronological precedence in some minds. It is possible 
also that no importance is to be attached to this order. 
Certainly John wrote last and after the destruction of Jeru- 
salem, while the others come before that great event if they 
are genuine, as I believe, though there are difficulties of a 
serious nature concerning II Peter. James may be very 
early. If so, these seven Epistles are scattered all. the 
way from A.D. 45 to go. They have no connection with 
He another save in the case of the Epistles of Peter and 

ude. 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION xiii 


IMPORTANCE OF THE GENERAL EPISTLES 


Without them we should be deprived of much concerning 
three outstanding personalities in early Christianity. We 
should know much less of ‘“‘James, and Cephas, and John, 
they who were reputed to be pillars” (Gal. 2:9). We should 
know less also of the Judaic (not Judaizing) form of Chris- 
tianity seen in the Epistles of James and Jude in contrast 
with, though not opposed to, the Pauline type. In Peter’s 
Epistles we see, indeed, a mediating position without com- 
promise of principle, for Peter in the Jerusalem Conference 
loyally supported Paul and Barnabas even if he did flicker 
for a moment later in Antioch. In the Johannine Epistles 
we see the great Eagle soar as in his Gospel in calm serenity 
in spite of conflict with the Gnostics who struck at the very 
life of Christianity itself. ‘The only opposition which re- 
mains worthy of a Christian’s consideration is that between 
light and darkness, truth and falsehood, love and hate, God 
and the world, Christ and Antichrist, life and death” (Plum- 
mer). So we can be grateful for the preservation of these 
little Epistles which reveal differences in the development 
of the great Christian leaders and the adaptation of the 
- gospel message to changing world conditions then and now.

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


_ Tue AvuTHoR 


He claims to be James, and so the book is not anonymous. 
It is either genuine or pseudonymous. He does not claim 
to be the brother of the Lord Jesus, as one might expect. 
James the brother of John was put to death by Herod 
Agrippa I about a.p. 44 (Acts 12:2). But James the brother 
of Jesus (Gal. 1:19) was still alive and became a leader of 
the church in Jerusalem (Acts 12:17), presiding over the © 
Conference in Jerusalem (Acts 15:13-21) and apparently 
writing the message from the Conference to the Gentile 
churches (15:22-29), and was still the leading elder in Jeru- 
salem on Paul’s last visit (21:18-25). James does not claim 
here to be an apostle and he was not one of the twelve 
apostles, and the dispute about accepting it of which Eu- 
sebius spoke was about its apostolicity since James was only 
an apostle by implication (Gal. 1:19) in the general sense of 
_ that term like Barnabas (Acts 14:14), perhaps Silas and 
Timothy (I Thess. 2:7), certainly not on a par with Paul, 
who claimed equality with the twelve. James, like the other 
brothers of Jesus, had once disbelieved his claims to be the 
Messiah (John 7:6f.), but he was won by a special vision of 
the Risen Christ (I Cor. 15:7) and was in the upper room 
before the great pentecost (Acts 1:14). It is plain that he 
had much to overcome as a zealous Jew to become a Chris- 
tian, though he was not a mere cousin of Jesus or a son of 
Joseph by a former marriage. He was strictly the half- 
brother of Jesus, since Joseph was not the actual father of 
Jesus. There is no reason to believe that he was a Nazirite. 
We know that he was married (I Cor. 9:5). He came to be 

3

called James the Just and was considered very devout. The 
Judaizers had counted on him to agree with them against 
Paul and Barnabas, but he boldly stood for Gentile freedom 
from the ceremonial law. The Judaizers still claimed him 
at Antioch and used his name wrongly to frighten Peter 
thereby (Gal. 2:12). But to the end he remained the loyal 
friend to Paul and his gospel rightly understood (Acts 21:18- 
25). Clement of Alexandria (Hypot. vii) says that, when he 
bore strong testimony to Jesus as the Son of man, they flung 
him down from the gable of the temple, stoned him, and 
beat him to death with a club. But Josephus (dnt. XX. 
ix. 1) says that the Sadducees about a.p. 62 had James and 
some others brought before the Sanhedrin (Ananus presiding) 
and had them stoned as transgressors of the law. At any 
rate he won a martyr’s crown like Stephen and James the 


brother of John. 


THE DaTE 


If the Epistle is genuine and James was put to death about 
A.D. 62, it was clearly written before that date. There are 
two theories about it, one placing it about a.p. 48, the other 
about a.p. 58. To my mind the arguments of Mayor for the 
early date are conclusive. There is no allusion to Gentile 
Christians, as would be natural after a.p. 50. If written 
after A.D. 70, the tone would likely be different, with some 
allusion to that dreadful calamity. The sins condemned are 
those characteristic of early Jewish Christians. The book 
itself is more like the Sermon on the Mount than the Epis- 
tles. The discussion of faith and works in chapter 2 reveals 
an absence of the issues faced by Paul in Rom. 4 and Gal. 3 
after the Jerusalem Conference (a.p. 49). Hence the date 
before that Conference has decidedly the better of the argu- 
ment. Ropes in his Commentary denies the genuineness of 
the Epistle and locates it between a.D. 75 and 125, but Hort 
holds that the evidence for a late date rests “on very slight 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 5 


and intangible grounds.” So we place the book before .p. 
49. It may indeed be the earliest New Testament book. 


THE READERS 


The author addresses himself ‘‘to the twelve tribes which 
are of the Dispersion” (James 1:1). Clearly, then, he is not 
writing to Gentiles, unless he includes the spiritual children 
of Abraham in the term Diaspora as Paul does for believers 
(Gal. 3:29; Rom. 9:6f.). The word diaspora occurs elsewhere 
in the N.T. only in John 7:35; I Pet. 1:1. It apparently has 
the spiritual significance in I Pet. 1:1, but in John 7:35 the 
usual meaning of Jews scattered over the world. The use 
here of ‘‘the twelve tribes”’ makes the literal sense probable . 
here. Clearly also James knew nothing of any “lost”’ tribes, 
for the Jews of the Dispersion were a blend of all the twelve 
tribes. It is probable also that James is addressing chiefly 
the Eastern Dispersion in Syria, Mesopotamia, and Baby- 
lonia as Peter writes to five provinces in the Western Dis- 
persion in Asia Minor. It is possible that James has in 
mind Christian and non-Christian Jews, not wholly non- 
Christian Jews as some hold. He may have in mind merely 
Christian Jews outside of Palestine, of whom there were al- 
ready many scattered since the great pentecost. The use of 
synagogue as a place of worship (2:2) like church (5:14) 
argues somewhat for this view. He presents the Mosaic 
law as still binding (2:g-11; 4:11). As the leading elder of 
the great church in Jerusalem and as a devout Jew and half- 
brother of Jesus, the message of James had a special appeal 
to these widely scattered Jewish Christians. 


THE Purpose 


If James is writing solely to non-Christian Jews, the pur- 
pose is to win them to Christ, and so he puts the gospel 
message in a way to get a hearing from the Jews. That is 
true, whether he has them in mind or not, though he does 


6 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


not do it by the suppression of the deity of Jesus Christ. 
In the very first verse he places him on a par with God as 
“the Lord Jesus Christ.”” In 2:1 he presents Jesus as the 
object of faith: “‘as you believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, 
who is the Glory” (Moffatt’s Translation), where Jesus is 
termed the Shekinah Glory of God. It is true that there is 
no discussion in the Epistle of the cross and the resurrection 
of Jesus, but there is an allusion to the murder of Jesus in 
§:6 and the second coming in 5:8. The chief aim of the 
Epistle is to strengthen the faith and loyalty of the Jewish 
Christians in the face of persecution from rich and over- 
bearing Jews who were defrauding and oppressing them. It 
is a picture of early Christian life in the midst of difficult 
social conditions between capital and labor which also exist 
today. So then it is a very modern message even if it 1s 
the earliest New Testament book. The glory of the New 
Testament lies precisely at this point in that the revelation 
of God in Christ meets our problems today because it did 
meet those of the first century a.p. Christian principles 
stand out clearly for our present-day living. 


THE STYLE 


James assumes the doctrinal features of Christianity, but 
he is concerned mainly with the ethical and social aspects 


of the gospel that Jewish followers of Christ may square . 


their lives with the gospel which they believe and profess. 
But this fact does not justify Luther in calling the Epistle 
of James ‘‘a veritable Epistle of straw.” Luther imagined 
that James contradicted Paul’s teaching of justification by 
faith. That is not true and the criticism of Luther is unjust. 
We shall see that, though James and Paul use the same 
words (faith, works, justify), they mean different things by 
them. It is possible that both Paul and Peter had read the 
Epistle of James, though by no means certain. M. Jones 
(New Testament in the Twentieth Century, >. 316) thinks that 


Me 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 7 


the author was familiar with Stoic philosophy. This is also 
possible, though he may have learned it only indirectly 
through the Wisdom of Solomon and Philo. What is true 
is that the author writes in the easy and accurate Koiné 
Greek of a cultivated Jew (the literary Koiné, not the ver- 
nacular), though not the artificial or stilted language of a 
professional stylist. Principal Patrick (ames the Lord’s 
Brother, p. 298) holds that he “‘had a wide knowledge of 
Classical Greek.” This does not follow, though he does use 
the manner “‘of the Hellenistic diatribe” (Ropes, Int. and 
Crit. Comm., p. 19) so common at that time. Ropes (pp. 
10 to 22) points out numerous parallels between James and 
the popular moral addresses of the period, familiar since the 
days of Socrates and at its height in Seneca and Epictetus. 
The use of an imaginary interlocutor is one instance (James 
2:18f.; 5:13f.) as is the presence of paradox (1:2, 10; 2:5; 
etc.). But the style of James is even more kin to that seen 
in the Jewish wisdom literature like Proverbs, the Wisdom 
of Solomon, etc. It is thus both tract and Epistle, a brief 
Christian sermon on a high plane for a noble purpose. But 
it is all natural and not artificial. The metaphors are many, 
but brief and remind one constantly of the Master’s use of 
them in the Sermon on the Mount. Did not Mary the 
mother of Jesus and James make frequent use of such homely 
parables? The author shows acquaintance with the LXX, 
but there are few Hebraisms in the language, though the 
style is Hebraic, as is the whole tone of the book (Hebraic 
and Christian). “The style is especially remarkable for con- 
stant hidden allusions to our Lord’s sayings, such as we find 
in the first three Gospels” (Hort).

of the Hebrew Jakob (so LXX). Common name among the 
Jews, and this man in Josephus (4nt. XX.9.1) and three 
others of this name in Josephus also. Servant (doulos). 
Bond-servant or slave as Paul (Rom. 1:1; Phil. 1:1; Tit. 
1:1). Of the Lord Fesus Christ (kuriou Iésou Christou). Were 
on a par with God (¢heou) and calls himself not adelphos 
(brother) of Jesus, but doulos. The three terms here as in 
2:1 have their full significance: Jesus is the Messiah and 
Lord. James is not an Ebionite. He accepts the deity of 
Jesus his brother, difficult as it was for him to. do so. The 
word kurios is frequent in the LXX for Elohim and Fahweh 
as the Romans applied it to the emperor in their emperor 
worship. See I Cor. 12:3 for Kurios Iésous and Phil. 2:11 
for Kurios Iésous Christos. To the twelve tribes (tais dodeka 
phulais). Dative case. The expression means “Israel in its 
fulness and completeness” (Hort), regarded as a unity (Acts 
26:7) with no conception of any “lost” tribes. Which are of 
the Dispersion (tais en téi diasporai). ‘Those in the Dis- 
persion” (repeated article). The term appears in Deut. 
28:25 (LXX) and comes from diaspeiré, to scatter (sow) 
abroad. In its literal sense we have it in John 7:34, but 
here and in I Pet. 1:1 Christian Jews are chiefly, if not wholly, 
in view. The Jews at this period were roughly divided into 
Palestinian Jews (chiefly agriculturists) and Jews of the Dis- 
persion (dwellers in cities and mainly traders). In Palestine 
Aramaic was spoken as a rule, while in the Western Diaspora 
the language was Greek (Koiné, LXX), though the Eastern 
Diaspora spoke Aramaic and Syriac. The Jews of the Dias- 
pora were compelled to compare their religion with the 

72 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 11 


various cults around them (comparative religion) and had 
a wider outlook on life. James writes thus in cultural Koiné 
but in the Hebraic tone. Greeting (chairein). Absolute in- 
finitive (present active of. chaird) as in Acts 15:23 (the 
Epistle to Antioch and the churches of Syria and Galatia). 
It is the usual idiom in the thousands of papyri letters 
known to us, but in no other New Testament letter. But 
note chairein legete in II John to and 11. 

2. Count it (hégésasthe). First aorist middle imperative of 
hégeomat, old verb to consider. Do it now and once for all. 
All joy (pasan charan). ‘‘Whole joy,” “unmixed joy,” as 
in Phil. 2:29. Not just “some joy” along with much grief. 
When (hotan). “Whenever,” indefinite temporal conjunc- 
tion. Ye fall into (peripeséte). Second aorist active sub- 
junctive (with the indefinite hotan) from peripip#o, literally 
to fall around (into the midst of), to fall among as in Luke 
10:30 /éistais periepesen (he fell among robbers). Only other 
N.T. example of this old compound is in Acts 27:41. Thu- 
cydides uses it of falling into affliction. It is the picture of 
being surrounded (peri) by trials. Manifold temptations 
(peirasmois poikilois). Associative instrumental case. The 
English word temptation is Latin and originally meant trials 
whether good or bad, but the evil sense has monopolized 
the word in our modern English, though we still say “at- 
tempt.” The word peirasmos (from peirazd, late form for 
the old peiraéd as in Acts 26:21, both in good sense as in 
John 6:6, and in bad sense as in Matt. 16:1) does not occur 
outside of the LXX and the N.T. except in Dioscorides 
(a.D. 100?) of experiments on diseases. ‘‘Trials” is clearly 
the meaning here, but the evil sense appears in verse 12 
(clearly in peirazo in verse 13) and so in Heb. 3:8. Trials 
rightly faced are harmless, but wrongly met become temp- 
tations to evil. The adjective poikilos (manifold) is as old 
as Homer and means variegated, many coloured as in Matt. 


12 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


4:24; 2 Tim. 3:6; Heb. 2:4. In I Pet. 1:6 we have this same 
phrase. It is a bold demand that James here makes. 

3. Knowing (gindskontes). Present active participle of 
ginosko (experimental knowledge, the only way of getting 
this view of “‘trials” as “all joy”). The proof (to dokimion). 
Now known (Deissmann, Bible Studies, pp. 259ff.) from the 
papyri examples of dokimios as an adjective in the same 
sense (good gold, standard gold) as dokimos proved or tested 
(James 1:12). The use of to dokimion (neuter article with 
neuter single adjective) here and in I Pet. 1:7, clearly means 
“the genuine element in your faith,” not “crucible” nor 
“proving.” Your faith like gold stands the test of fire and 
is approved as standard. James here, as in verse 6; 2:1; 
§:15, regards faith (pistis) like Paul “as the very foundation 
of religion” (Mayor). Worketh (katergazetai). Present (du- 
rative) middle indicative of the compound verb with the 
perfective sense of kata as in Phil. 2:12, which see. Patience 
(hupomonén). Old and common word for remaining under 
(Aupomend), “staying power” (Ropes), as in Col. 1:11. 

4. Let have (echetd). Present active imperative of echd, let 
it keep on having. Perfect (teleion). See Rom. 5:3f. for a 
like chain of blessings. Carry on the work to the end or 
completion (from ¢e/os, end) as in John 17:4 (¢o ergon telei- 
dsas, having finished the work). That ye may be (hina éte). 
Purpose clause with hina and present active subjunctive of 
eimi. This is the goal of patience. Perfect and entire (teleioi 
kai holokleroi). Perfected at the end of the task (¢e/os) and 
complete in all parts (Aolok/éroi, holos whole and kiéros lot or 
part). “Perfected all over.” These two adjectives often 
occur together in Philo, Plutarch, etc. See Acts 3:16 for 
holoklérian (perfect soundness). Lacking in nothing (en 
médeni leipomenoi). Present passive participle of /eipd.to 
leave. Negative statement of the preceding positive as 
often in James (cf. 1:6). There is now a digression (verses 
5 to 8) from the discussion of peirasmos, which is taken up 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 13 


again in verse 9. The word J/eipomenoi (lacking) suggests 
the digression. 

5. Lacketh wisdom (leipetai sophias). Condition of first 
class, assumed as true, ei and present passive indicative of 
leipo to be destitute of, with ablative case sophias. “If any 
one falls short of wisdom.” A banking figure, to have a 
shortage of wisdom (not just knowledge, gvdseds, but wisdom 
sophias, the practicaluseof knowledge). Let him ask (aiteito). 
Present active imperative of aited, “let him keep on ask- 
ing.” Of God (para tou theou). ‘From (from beside) God,” 
ablative case with para. Liberally (haplos). This old adverb 
occurs here only in the N.T. (from hap/ous, single-fold, Matt. 
6:22, and haplofés, simplicity, generosity, is common—II Cor. 
8:2; Rom. 12:8). But the adverb is common in the papyri 
by way of emphasis as simply or at all (Moulton and Milli- 
gan’s Vocabulary). Mayor argues for the sense of ‘“‘uncon- 
ditionally”’ (the logical moral sense) while Hort and Ropes 
agree and suggest “graciously.” The other sense of “‘abun- 
dantly” or “‘liberally” suits the idea in Aaplotés in II Cor. 
8:2 and Rom. 12:8, but no example of the adverb in this 
sense has been found unless this is one here. See Is. 55:1 
for the idea of God’s gracious giving and the case of Solomon 
(I Kings 3:9-12; Prov. 2:3). Upbraideth not (mé oneidi- 
zontos). Present active participle of oneidizd (old verb to 
reproach, to cast in one’s teeth, Matt. 5:11) in the ablative 
case like didontos agreeing with theou and with the usual 
negative of the participle (mé). This is the negative state- 
ment of didontos haplos (giving graciously). The evil habit 
of giving stinging words along with the money is illustrated 
in Sirach 41:22 and Plutarch (De adulat., p. 64A). Cf. Heb. 
4:16. And it shall be given him (kai dothésetai autoi). First 
future passive of didomi, a blessed promise in accord with 
the words of Jesus (Matt. 7:7, 11; Luke 11:13), meaning 
here not only “wisdom,” but all good gifts, including the 


14 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Holy Spirit. There are frequent reminiscences of the words 
of Jesus in this Epistle. 

6. In faith (en pistei). Faith here “is the fundamental 
religious attitude” (Ropes), belief in God’s beneficent ac- 
tivity and personal reliance on him (Oesterley). Nothing 
doubting (méden diakrinomenos). Negative way of saying 
en pistei (in faith), present passive participle of diakrind, old 
verb to separate (krind) between (dia), to discriminate as 
shown clearly in Acts 11:12, 15:9, but no example of the 
sense of divided against oneself has been found earlier than 
the N.T., though it appears in later Christian writings. It 
is like the use of diamerizomai in Luke 11:18 and occurs in 
Matt. 21:21; Mark 11:23; Acts 10:20; Rom. 2:4; 4:20; 14:23. 
It is a vivid picture of internal doubt. Js like (eoiken). 
Second perfect active indicative with the linear force alone 
from eiké to be like. Old form, but in N.T. only here and 
verse 23 (a literary touch, not in LXX). The surge of the 
sea (kludoni thalassés). Old word (from k/uzd to wash 
against) for a dashing or surging wave in contrast with kuma 
(successive waves), in N.T. only here and Luke 8:24. In 
associative instrumental case after eoiken. In Eph. 4:14 we 
have kludonizé (from kludoén), to toss by waves. Driven by 
the wind (anemizomendi). Present passive participle (agree- 
ing in case with k/udoni) of anemiz6, earliest known example 
and probably coined by James (from anemos), who is fond 
of verbs in -izd (Mayor). The old Greek used anemod. In 
Eph. 4:14 Paul uses both k/udonizo and peripherod anemot. 
It is a vivid picture of the sea whipped into white-caps by 
the winds. Tossed (ripizomendi). Present passive participle 
also in agreement with k/udoni from ripizd, rare verb (Aris- 
tophanes, Plutarch, Philo) from ripis (a bellows or fire-fan), 
here only in N.T. It is a picture of “the restless swaying 
to and fro of the surface of the water, blown upon by shift- 
ing breezes”’ (Hort), the waverer with slight rufflement. 

4. That man (ho anthropos ekeinos). Emphatic use of 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 15 


ekeinos. Of the Lord (para tou kuriou). Ablative case with 
para like theou in verse 5. 

8. Man (anér). Instead of anthropos (general term) in 
verse 7, perhaps for variety (Ropes), but often in James 
(1:12, 23; 2:2; 3:2), though in other Epistles usually in dis- 
tinction from guné (woman). Double-minded (dipsuchos). 
First appearance of this compound known and in N.T. only 
here and 4:8. Apparently coined by James, but copied often 
in early Christian writings and so an argument for the early 
date of James’ Epistle (Moulton and Milligan’s Vocabulary). 
From dis twice and psuché soul, double-souled, double- 
minded, Bunyan’s “Mr. Facing-both-ways.” Cf. the rebuke 
to Peter (edistasas) in Matt. 14:31. Unstable (akatastatos). 
Late double compound (alpha privative and katastatos verbal 
from kathistémi), in LXX once (Is. 54:11) and in Polybius, 
in N.T. only here and 3:8. It means unsteady, fickle, stagger- 
ing, reeling like a drunken man. Surely to James such 
“doubt” is no mark of intellectuality. 

g. But (de). Return to the point of view in verse 2. Of 
low degree (ho tapeinos). “The lowly” brother, in outward 
condition (Luke 1:52), humble and poor as in Ps. 9:39; Prov. 
30:14, not the spiritually humble as in Matt. 11:29; James 
4:6. In the LXX sapeinos was used for either the poor in 
goods or the poor in spirit. Christianity has glorified this 
word in both senses. Already the rich and the poor in the 
churches had their occasion for jealousies. Glory in his high 
estate (kauchasthd en toi hupsei autou). Paradox, but true. 
In his low estate he is “in his height” (Aupsos, old word, 
in N.T., also in Luke 1:78; Eph. 3:1; etc.). 

10. In that he is made low (en téi tapeindsei autou). “In 
his low estate.” Play on tapeindsis (from tapeinod, Phil. 
3:7), like tapeinos of verse 9, old word in various senses, 
in N.T. only here, Luke 1:48; Acts 8:33; Phil. 3:21. The 
Cross of Christ lifts up the poor and brings down the high. 
It is the great leveller of men. 4s the flower of the grass 


1 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(hos anthos chortou). From the LXX (Is. 40:6). Chortos 
means pasture, then grass (Mark 6:39) or fodder. <Anthos 
is old word, in N.T. only here, verse 11, and I Pet. 1:24 
(same quotation). This warning is here applied to “the 
rich brother,” but it is true of all. He shall pass away 
(pareleusetai). Wuture middle indicative (effective aoristic 
future, shall pass completely away from earth). 

11. Ariseth (aneteilen). Gnomic or timeless aorist active 
indicative of the old compound azatellé, used here of plants 
(cf. anathallé in Phil. 4:10), often of the sun (Matt. 13:6). 
With the scorching wind (sun toi kausoni). Associative in- 
strumental case with sun. In the LXX this late word (from 
kausos) is usually the sirocco, the dry east wind from the 
desert (Job 1:19). In Matt. 20:12 and Luke 12:56 it is the 
burning heat of the sun. Either makes sense here. With- 
ereth (exéranen). Another gnomic aorist active indicative 
(Robertson, Grammar, p. 837) of xéraind, old verb (from 
xéros, dry or withered, Matt. 12:10), to dry up. Grass and 
flowers are often used to picture the transitoriness of human 
life, Falleth (exepesen). Another gnomic aorist (second 
aorist active indicative) of ekpipto to fall out (off). The 
grace (hé euprepeia). Old word (from euprepés well-looking, 
not in the N.T.), only here in N.T. Goodly appearance, 
beauty. Of the fashion of it (tou prosopou autou). ““Of the 
face of it.” The flower is pictured as having a “‘face,” like 
a rose or lily. Perisheth (apoleto). Another gnomic aorist 
(second aorist middle indicative of apollumi, to destroy, but 
intransitive here, to perish). The beautiful rose is pitiful 
when withered. Shall fade away (maranthésetai). Future 
passive indicative of maraind, old verb, to extinguish a flame, 
a light. Used of roses in Wisdom 2:8. Goings (poreiais). 
Old word from poreud to journey, in N.T. only here and 
Luke 13:22 (of Christ’s journey toward Jerusalem). The 
rich man’s travels will come to “journey’s end.” | 

12. Endureth (hupomenei). Present active indicative of 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 17 


hupomend. Cf. verse 3. Temptation (peirasmon). Real 
temptation here. See verse 2 for “‘trials.” When he hath 
been approved (dokimos genomenos). “Having become ap- 
proved,” with direct reference to fo dokimion in verse 3. 
See also Rom. 5:4 for dokimé (approval after test as of gold 
or silver). This beatitude (makarios) is for the one who has 
come out unscathed. See I Tim. 6:9. The crown of life 
(ton stephanon tés xoés). The same phrase occurs in Rev. 
2:10. It is the genitive of apposition, life itself being the 
crown as in I Pet. 5:4. This crown is “an honourable orna- 
ment” (Ropes), with possibly no reference to the victor’s 
crown (garland of leaves) as with Paul in I Cor. 9:25; II 
Tim. 4:8, nor to the linen fillet (diadema) of royalty (Ps. 
20:3, where stephanos is used like diadéma, the kingly crown). 
Stephanos has a variety of uses. Cf. the thorn chaplet on 
Jesus (Matt. 27:29). The Lord. Not in the oldest Greek 
MSS., but clearly implied as the subject of epéggeilato (he 
promised, first aorist middle indicative). 

13. Let no one say (médeis legeto). Present active im- 
perative, prohibiting such a habit. When he is tempted 
(peirazomenos). Present passive participle of peirazd, here 
in evil sense of tempt, not test, as in Matt. 4:1. Verses 12 
to 18 give a vivid picture of temptation. I am tempted of 
God (apo theou peirazomai). The use of apo shows origin 
(apo with ablative case), not agency (Aupo), as in Mark 
1:13, of Satan. It is contemptible, but I have heard wicked 
and weak men blame God for their sins. Cf. Prov. 19:3; 
Sirach 15:11f. Temptation does not spring “from God.” 
Cannot be tempted with evil (apeirastos kakon). Verbal com- 
pound adjective (alpha privative and peirazo), probably 
with the ablative case, as is common with alpha privative 
(Robertson, Grammar, p. 516), though Moulton (Proleg- 
omena, p. 74) treats it as the genitive of definition. The 
ancient Greek has apeiratos (from peirad), but this is the 
earliest example of apeirastos (from peirazd) made on the 


LCIBRARY OF JESS COOKE 


18 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


same model. Only here in the N.T. Hort notes apetratos 
kakon as a proverb (Diodorus, Plutarch, Josephus) “‘free 
from evils.” That is possible here, but the context calls 
for ““untemptable” rather than “untempted.” And he him- 
self tempteth no man (petrazei de autos oudena). Because 
“untemptable.” 

14. When he is drawn away by his own lust (hupo tés idias 
epithumias exelkomenos). Epithumia is old word for craving 
(from epithumed, to have a desire for) either good (Phil. 
1:23) or evil (Rom. 7:7) as here. Like a fish drawn out 
from his retreat. Enticed (deleazomenos). Present passive 
participle of deleazd, old verb from delear (bait), to catch 
fish by bait or to hunt with snares and Philo has huph’ 
hédonés deleazetai (is enticed by pleasure). In N.T. only 
here and II Pet. 2:14, 18. Allured by definite bait. 

15. Then (eita). The next step. The lust (hé epithumia). 
Note article, the lust (verse 14) which one has. When it 
hath conceived (sullabousa). Second aorist active participle 
of sullambano, old word to grasp together, in hostile sense 
(Acts 26:21), in friendly sense of help (Phil. 4:3), in tech- 
nical sense of a woman taking a man’s seed in conception 
(Luke 1:24), here also of lust (as a woman), “having con- 
ceived.” The will yields to lust and conception takes place. 
Beareth sin (tiktet hamartian). Present active indicative of 
tikto to bring forth as a mother or fruit from seed, old verb, 
often in N.T., here only in James. Sin is the union of the 
will with lust. See Ps. 7:14 for this same metaphor. The — 
sin (hé hamartia). The article refers to hamartia just men- 
tioned. When it is’ full-grown (apotelestheisa). First aorist 
passive participle of apoteled, old compound verb with per- 
fective use of apo, in N.T. only here and Luke 13:32. It 
does not mean “full-grown” like ¢e/eiod, but rather com- 
pleteness of parts or functions as opposed to rudimentary 
state (Hort) like the winged insect in contrast with the 
chrysalis or grub (Plato). The sin at birth is fully equipped 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 19 


for its career (Rom. 6:6; Col. 3:5). Bringeth forth death 
(apokuei thanaton). Late compound (kweé to be pregnant, 
perfective use of apo) to give birth to, of animals and women, 
for normal birth (papyrus example) and abnormal birth 
(Hort). A medical word (Ropes) rather than a literary one 
like tiktd. The child of lust is sin, of sin is death, powerful 
figure of abortion. The child is dead at birth. For death 
as the fruit of sin see Rom. 6:21-23; 8:6. “‘The birth of 
death follows of necessity when one sin is fully formed” 
(Hort). 

16. Be not deceived (mé plandsthe). Prohibition with mé 
and the present passive imperative of planad, common verb 
to lead astray. This is the way of sin to deceive and to kill © 
(Rom. 7:7-14). The devil is a pastmaster at blinding men’s 
eyes about sin (II Cor. 4:4; Rom. 1:27; Eph. 4:14; etc.). 

17. Gift (dosis)—boon (déréma). Both old substantives 
from the same original verb (diddmi), to give. Dosis is the 
act of giving (ending -sis), but sometimes by metonymy 
for the thing given like ktisis for ktisma (Col. 1:15). But 
dorema (from dored, from déron a gift) only means a gift, a 
benefaction (Rom. 5:16). The contrast here argues for 
“giving” as the idea in dosis. Curiously enough there is 
a perfect hexameter line here: pasa do / sis aga / thé kai / 
pan do / rema te / leion. Such accidental rhythm occurs 
occasionally in many writers. Ropes (like Ewald and 
Mayor) argues for a quotation from an unknown source 
because of the poetical word doréma, but that is not con- 
clusive. From above (anothen). That is, from heaven. Cf. 
John 3:31; 19:11. Coming down (katabainon). Present ac- 
tive neuter singular participle of katabaind agreeing with 
dorema, expanding and explaining andthen (from above). 
From the Father of lights (apo tou patros ton photon). “Of 
the lights” (the heavenly bodies). For this use of pasér see 
Job 38:28 (Father of rain); II Cor. 1:3; Eph. 1:17. God 
is the Author of light and lights. With whom (par’ hdi). 


20 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


For para (beside) with locative sense for standpoint of God 
see para toi theoi (Mark 10:27; Rom. 2:11; 9:14; Eph. 6:9. 
Can be no (ouk eni). This old idiom (also in Gal. 3:28; 
Col. 3:11) may be merely the original form of en with reces- 
sive accent (Winer, Mayor) or a shortened form of enesti. 
The use of evi en in I Cor. 6:5 argues for this view, as does 
the use of eine (einai) in Modern Greek (Robertson, Gram- 
mar, p. 313). Variation (parallagé). Old word from paral- 
lasso, to make things alternate, here only in N.T. In 
Aristeas in sense of alternate stones in pavements. Dio 
Cassius has parallaxis without reference to the modern 
astronomical parallax, though James here is comparing God 
(Father of the lights) to the sun (Mal. 4:2), which does 
have periodic variations. Shadow that is cast by turning 
(tropes aposkiasma). Tropé is an old word for “turning” 
(from trepé to turn), here only in N.T. Aposkiasma is a 
late and rare word (aposkiasmos in Plutarch) from aposkiazé 
(apo, skia) a shade cast by one object on another. It is 
not clear what the precise metaphor is, whether the shadow 
thrown’ on the dial (aposkiazé in Plato) or the borrowed 
light of the moon lost to us as it goes behind the earth. In 
fact, the text is by no means certain, for Aleph B papyrus 
of fourth century actually read hé tropés aposkiasmatos (the 
variation of the turning of the shadow). Ropes argues 
strongly for this reading, and rather convincingly. At any 
rate there is no such periodic variation in God like that we 
see in the heavenly bodies. 

18. Of his own will (boulétheis). First aorist passive par- 
ticiple of doulomai. Repeating the metaphor of birth in 
verse 15, but in good sense. God as Father acted deliber- 
ately of set purpose. He brought us forth (apekuésen). First 
aorist active indicative of apokued (verse 15), only here of 
the father (4 Macc. 15:17), not of the mother. Regenera- 
tion, not birth of all men, though God is the Father in the 
sense of creation of all men (Acts 17:28f.). By the word of 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 21 


truth (logoi alétheias). Instrumental case Jogdi. The refer- 
ence is thus to the gospel message of salvation even without 
the article (II Cor. 6:7) as here, and certainly with the 
article (Col. 1:5; Eph. 1:13; II Tim. 2:15). The message 
marked by truth (genitive case alétheias). That we should 
be (eis to einai hemas). Purpose clause eis to and the in- 
finitive einai with the accusative of general reference hemds 
(as to us). 4 kind of first-fruits (aparchén tina). “Some 
first-fruits” (old word from aparchomai), of Christians of 
that age. See Rom. 16:5. 

19. Ye know this (iste). Or “know this.” Probably the 
perfect active indicative (literary form as in Eph. §:5; Heb. 
12:17, unless both are imperative, while in James 4:4 we 
have oidate, the usual vernacular Koiné perfect indicative). 
The imperative uses only iste and only the context can de- 
cide which it is. Esto (let be) is imperative. Swift to hear 
(tachus eis to akousai). For this use of eis to with the in- 
finitive after an adjective see I Thess. 4:9. For eis to after 
adjectives see Rom. 16:19. The picture points to listening 
to the word of truth (verse 18) and is aimed against violent 
and disputatious speech (chapter 3:1-12). The Greek moral- 
ists often urge a quick and attentive ear. Slow to speak 
(bradus eis to lalésai). Same construction and same ingres- 
sive aorist active infinitive, slow to begin speaking, not 
slow while speaking. Slow to anger (bradus eis orgen). He 
drops the infinitive here, but he probably means that slow- 
ness to speak up when angry will tend to curb the anger. 

20. The wrath of man (orgé andros). Here anér (as op- 
posed to guné woman), not anthropos of verse 19 (inclusive 
of both man and woman). If taken in this sense, it means 
that a man’s anger (settled indignation in contrast with 
thumos, boiling rage or fury) does not necessarily work God’s 
righteousness. There is such a thing as righteous indigna- 
tion, but one is not necessarily promoting the cause of God 
by his own personal anger. See Acts 10:35 for “working 


22 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


righteousness,” and James 2:9 for ‘working sin” (ergazomat 
both times). 

21. Wherefore (dio). Because of this principle. See Eph. 
4:25. Putting away (apothemenoi). Second aorist middle 
participle of apotithémi, to put off, metaphor of removing 
clothing as in Rom. 13:12; Col. 3:8; Eph. 4:22, 25; I Pet. 
2:1, Filthiness (ruparian). Late word (Plutarch) from 
ruparos, dirty (James 2:2), here only in N.T. Surely a 
dirty garment. Overflowing of wickedness (perisseian kakias). 
Perisseia is a late word (from perissos, abundant, exceeding), 
only four times in N.T., in II Cor. 8:2 with charas (of joy), 
in Rom. 5:17 with charitos (of grace). Kakia (from kakos, 
evil) can be either general like ruparia (filthiness, naughti- 
ness), or special like “‘malice.” But any of either sense is 
a “superfluity.” With meekness (en praiitéti). In docility. 
“The contrast is with org@ rather than kakias” (Ropes). 
The implanted word (ton emphuton logon). This old verbal 
adjective (from emphué to implant, to grow in), only here 
in N.T., meaning properly ingrown, inborn, not emphuteuton 
(engrafted). It is “the rooted word” (verse 18), sown in 
the heart as the soil or garden of God (Matt. 13:3-23; 
15:13; I Cor. 3:6). Able to save (dunamenon sisai). CE. 
I Pet. 1:9; James 2:14; 4:12; 5:20; Rom. 1:16. Ultimate 
salvation (effective aorist active infinitive sdsai from 5020). 

22. But be ye (ginesthe de). Rather, “But keep on be- 
coming” (present middle imperative of ginomai). Doers of 
the word (poietai logou). Old word for agent (-tés) from 
poied to do as in 4:11; Rom. 2:13, but in Acts 17:28 our 
“poet” (long regarded as a “doer” or “‘maker”). Hearers 
(akroatai). Old word for agent again from akroamai (to be 
a hearer), in N.T. only here and Rom. 2:13. Deluding your- 
selves (paralogizomenoi heautous). Present middle (direct) 
participle of paralogizomai, to reckon aside (para) and so 
wrong, to cheat, to deceive. Redundant reflexive heautous 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 23 
with the middle. In N.T. only here and Col. 2:4. Such a 


man does not delude anyone but himself. 

23. And not a doer (kai ou poiétés). Condition of first 
class, assumed as true, and ow (rather than mé) contrasts 
potetés with akroatés. Unto a man beholding (andri kata- 
noounti). Associative instrumental case after eoitken as in 
1:6. Note andri as in 1:8 in contrast with gunaiki (woman), 
not anthropoi (general term for man). Present active par- 
ticiple of katanoed to put the mind down on (kata, nous), 
to consider attentively, to take note of, as in verse 24 
(katenoesen). His natural face (to prosopon tés geneseds au- 
tou). ““The face of his birth” (origin, lineage, nativity). 
For this use of genesis see 3:6; Matt. 1:1, 18; Luke 1:13: 
In a mirror (en esoptroi). Old word (from eis, opto) in N.T. 
only here and I Cor. 13:12. The mirrors of the ancients 
were not of glass, but of polished metal (of silver or usually 
of copper and tin). See katoptrizomai in II Cor. 3:18. 

24. He beholdeth himself (katenoésen heauton). Usually ex- 
plained as gnomic aorist like those in 1:11, but the ordinary 
force of the tenses is best here. “He glanced at himself 
(katenoésen aorist) and off he has gone (apeléluthen perfect 
active) and straightway forgot (epelatheto, second aorist 
middle indicative of epilanthanomai) what sort of a man he 
was” (hopoios én, back in the picture, imperfect tense). 
The tenses thus present a vivid and lifelike picture of the 
careless listener to preaching (Christ’s wayside hearer). 

25. He that looketh into (ho parakupsas). First aorist ac- 
tive articular participle of parakupto, old verb, to stoop and 
look into (John 20:5, 11), to gaze carefully by the side of, 
to peer into or to peep into (I Pet. 1:12). Here the notion 
of beside (para) or of stooping (kuptd) 1s not strong. Some- 
times, as Hort shows, the word means only a cursory glance, 
but the contrast with verse 24 seems to preclude that here. 
The perfect law (nomon teleion). For teleion see 1:17. See 
Rom. 7:12 for Paul’s idea of the law of God. James here 


24 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


refers to the word of truth (1:18), the gospel of grace (Gal. 
6:2; Rom. 12:2). The law of liberty (ton tés eleutherias). 
“That of liberty,” explaining why it is “perfect” (2:12 
also), rests on the work of Christ, whose truth sets us free 
(John 8:32; II Cor. 3:16; Rom. 8:2). And so continueth 
(kai parameinas). First aorist active articular participle 
again of paramend, parallel with parakupsas. Parameno is 
to stay beside, and see Phil. 1:25 for contrast with the 
simplex mend. Being (genomenos). Rather, “having be- 
come” (second aorist middle participle of ginomai to be- 
come). Nota hearer that forgetteth (ouk akroatés epilesmonés). 
“Not a hearer of forgetfulness” (descriptive genitive, marked 
by forgetfulness). Epilésmoné is a late and rare word (from 
epilésmon, forgetful, from epilanthomai, to forget, as in verse 
24), here only in N.T. But a doer that worketh (alla poiétés 
ergou). “But a doer of work,” a doer marked by work 
(descriptive genitive ergou), not by mere listening or mere 
talk. In his doing (en téi poiései autou). Another beatitude 
with makarios as in 1:12, like the Beatitudes in Matt. 
§:3-12.° Poiésis is an old word (from poieo for the act of 
doing), only here in N.T. 

26. Thinketh himself to be religious (dokei thréskos einai). 
Condition of first class (ei-dokei). Thréskos (of uncertain et- 
ymology, perhaps from threomai, to mutter forms of prayer) 
is predicate nominative after einai, agreeing with the sub- 
ject of dokei (either “he seems” or “he thinks’). This 
source of self-deception is in saying and doing. The word 
threskos is found nowhere else except in lexicons. Hatch 
(Essays in Biblical Greek, pp. 55-57) shows that it refers 
to the external observances of public worship, such as 
church attendance, almsgiving, prayer, fasting (Matt. 6:1- 
18). Itis the Pharisaic element in Christian worship. While 
he bridleth not his tongue (mé chalinagogon glossan heautou). 
“Not bridling his own tongue.” A reference to verse 19 
and the metaphor is repeated in 3:12. This is the earliest 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 25 


known example of the compound chalinagoged (chalinos, 
bridle agd, to lead). It occurs also in Lucian. The picture 
is that of a man putting the bridle in his own mouth, not 
in that of another. See the similar metaphor of muzzling 
(phimod) one’s mouth (Matt. 22:12 ephimothé). Deceiveth 
(apaton). Present active participle from apaté (deceit). He 
plays a trick on himself. Religion (thréskeia). Later form 
of thréskié (Herodotus) from thréskos above. It means re- 
ligious worship in its external observances, religious exer- 
cise or discipline, but not to the exclusion of reverence. In 
the N.T. we have it also in Acts 26:5 of Judaism and in 
Col. 2:18 of worshipping angels. It is vain (mataios, fem- 
inine form same as masculine) or empty. Comes to nothing. 

27. Pure religion and undefiled (thréskeia kathara kai ami- 
antos). Numerous examples in papyri and inscriptions of 
thréskeia for ritual and reverential worship in the Roman 
Empire (Moulton and Milligan’s Vocabulary; Deissmann, 
St. Paul, p. 251). As Hort shows, this is not a definition 
of religion or religious worship, but only a pertinent illus- 
tration of the right spirit of religion which leads to such 
acts. Before our God and Father (para toi theot kai patri). 
By the side of (para) and so from God’s standpoint (Mark 
10:27). Amiantos (compound verbal adjective, alpha priva- 
tive, miaino to defile), puts in negative form (cf. 1:4, 6) 
the idea in kathara (pure, clean). This (haute). Feminine 
demonstrative pronoun in the predicate agreeing with thrés- 
keia. To visit (episkeptesthai). Epexegetic (explaining haute) 
present middle infinitive of episkeptomai, common verb to 
go to see, to inspect, present tense for habit of going to see. 
See Matt. 25:36, 43 for visiting the sick. The fatherless and 
widows (orphanous kai chéras). “The natural objects of 
charity in the community” (Ropes). Orphanos is old word 
for bereft of father or mother or both. In N.T. only here 
and John 14:18. Note order (orphans before widows). Un- 
spotted (aspilon). Old adjective (alpha privative and spilos, 


26 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


spot), spotless. This the more important of the two illus- 
trations and the hardest to execute. To keep (férein). 
Present active infinitive, “to keep on keeping oneself un- 
specked from the world” (a world, kosmos, full of dirt and 
slime that bespatters the best of men). 


CHAPTER II 


1. My brethren (adelphoi mou). Transition to a new topic 
as in 1:19; 2:5, 14; 3:1; 5:7. Hold not (mé echete). Present 
active imperative of echd with negative mé, exhortation to 
stop holding or not to have the habit of holding in the 
fashion condemned. The faith of our Lord Fesus Christ (ten 
pistin tou kuriou hémon Iésou Christou). Clearly objective 
genitive, not subjective (faith of), but “faith in our Lord 
Jesus Christ,” like echete pistin theou (Mark 11:22), “‘have 
faith in God.”” See the same objective genitive with pistis 
in Acts 3:6; Gal. 2:16; Rom. 3:22; Rev. 14:12. Note also 
the same combination as in 1:1 “our Lord Jesus Christ” 
(there on a par with God). The Lord of Glory (tés doxés). 
Simply ‘“‘the Glory.” No word for “Lord” (kuriou) in the 
Greek text. Tés doxés clearly in apposition with tou kuriou 
Iésou Christou. James thus terms ‘“‘our Lord Jesus Christ” 
the Shekinah Glory of God. See Heb. 9:5 for “‘the cherubim 
of Glory.”” Other New Testament passages where Jesus 1s 
pictured as the Glory are Rom. g:4; II Cor. 4:6; Eph. 1:17; 
Heb. 1:3. Cf. II Cor. 8:9; Phil. 2:5-11. With respect of 
persons (en prosopolempsiais). A Christian word, like proso- 
polémptés (Acts 10:34) and prosdpolempteite (James 2:9), not 
in LXX or any previous Greek, but made from prosopon 
lambanein (Luke 20:21; Gal. 2:6), which is a Hebrew idiom 
for panim nasa, “to lift up the face on a person,” to be 
favorable and so partial to him. See prosdpolempsia in this 
sense of partiality (respect of persons) in Rom. 2:11; Col. 
3:25; Eph. 6:9 (nowhere else in N.T.). Do not show 
partiality. 

2. For (gar). An illustration of the prohibition. Jf there 
come in (ean eiselthéi). Condition of third class (supposable 

27 


28 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


case) with ean and second (ingressive) aorist active sub- 
junctive of eiserchomai. Into your synagogue (eis sunagogén 
humoén). The common word for the gathering of Jews for 
worship (Luke 12:11) and particularly for the building where 
they met (Luke 4:15, 20, 28, etc.). Here the first is the 
probable meaning as it clearly is in Heb. 10:25 (té episuna- 
gogén heauton), where the longer compound occurs. It may 
seem a bit odd for a Christian church (ekk/ésia) to be termed 
sunagogé, but James is writing to Jewish Christians and 
this is another incidental argument for the early date. 
Epiphanius (Haer. XXX. 18) states that the Ebionites call 
their church sunagogé, not ekklésia. In the fourth century 
an inscription has sunagdgé for the meeting-house of certain 
Christians. 4 man with a gold ring (anér chrusodaktulios). 
“A gold-fingered man,” “wearing a gold ring.” The word 
occurs nowhere else, but Lucian has chrusocheir (gold- 
handed) and Epictetus has chrusous daktulious (golden seal- 
rings). ‘‘Hannibal, after the battle of Cannae, sent as a 
great trophy to Carthage, three bushels of gold-rings from 
the fingers of Roman knights slain in battle” (Vincent). 
In fine clothing (en esthéti lamprai). “In bright (brilliant) 
clothing” as in Luke 23:11; Acts 10:30; Rev. 18:41. In 
contrast with “‘vile clothing” (en rupardi esthéti), “new 
glossy clothes and old shabby clothes” (Hort). Ruparos 
(late word from rupos, filth, I Pet. 3:21) means filthy, dirty. 
In N.T. only here and Rev. 22:11 (filthy). Poor man 
(ptochos). Beggarly mendicant (Matt. 19:21), the opposite 
of plousios (rich). | 

3. And ye have regard to (epiblepséte de epi). First aorist 
active subjunctive (still with ean of verse 2) of epiblepéo, 
followed by repeated preposition epi, to gaze upon, old com- 
pound, in N.T. only here and Luke 1:48; 9:38. Weareth 
(phorounta). ‘‘Wearing,” present active participle of the 
old frequentative verb phored (from pherd), to bear con- 
stantly, to wear (Matt. 11:8). Note repeated article tén 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 29 


(the) with esthéta pointing to verse 2. And say (kai eipéte). 
Continuing tne third-class condition with ean and second 
aorist active subjunctive of eipon. Sit thou here in a good 
place (su kathou hide kalés). Emphatic position of su, ‘Do 
thou sit here in a good place.” Present middle imperative 
of kathémai to sit for the literary kathéso. See Matt. 23:6 
for the first seats in the synagogue (places of honour). And 
ye say to the poor man (kai toi ptochoi eipéte). Third class 
condition with ean continued as before (eipéte). Note article 
Oi pointing to verse 2. Stand thou there (su stéthi ekei). 
Second aorist (intransitive) active imperative of hist@mi, to 
place. Ingressive aorist, Take a stand. Su emphatic again. 
The MSS. vary in the position of ekei (there). Or sit under 
my footstool (@ kathou hupo to hupopodion mou). For this 
use of hupo “down against” or “down beside” see Ex. 
19:17 hupo to oros (“at the foot of the mountain”) and 
hupo se (“at thy feet”) (Deut. 33:3). Conquerors often 
placed their feet on the necks of the victims (Luke 20:43). 

4. Are ye not divided in your own mind? (ou diekrithéte en 
heautois;). First aorist (gnomic) passive indicative of diak- 
rind, to separate, conclusion of the third-class condition 
(future) in a rhetorical question in the gnomic aorist (as if 
past) with ow expecting an affirmative answer. For this 
idiom (gnomic aorist) in a conclusion of the third-class con- 
dition see I Cor. 7:28. “Were ye not divided in (among) 
yourselves?” Cf.1:6; Matt. 21:21. Fudges with evil thoughts 
(kritait dialogismon poneron). Descriptive genitive as in 
1:25. Dialogismos is an old word for reasoning (Rom. 1:21). 
Reasoning is not necessarily evil, but see Matt. 15:19 
(ponéroi) and Mark 7:21 (kakoi) for evil reasonings, and I 
Tim. 2:8 without an adjective. See James 1:8 and 4:8 for 
dipsuchos. ‘They are guilty of partiality (a divided mind) 
as between the two strangers. 

5. Did not God choose? (ouch ho theos exelexato;). Affirma- 
tive answer expected. First aorist middle (indirect, God 


30 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


chose for himself) indicative of ek/egd, the very form used 
by Paul three times of God’s choice in I Cor. 1:27f. 4s to 
the world (toi kosmoi). ‘The ethical dative of interest, as 
the world looks at it as in Acts 7:20; I Cor. 1:18; II Cor. 
10:4; James 4:4. By the use of the article (the poor) James 
does not affirm that God chose all the poor, but only that 
he did choose poor people (Matt. 10:23-26; I Cor. 1:26-28). 
Rich in faith (plousious en pistei). Rich because of their 
faith. As he has shown in t:of. Which he promised (hés 
epeggeilato). Genitive of the accusative relative hén at- 
tracted to the case of the antecedent dasileias (the Messianic 
kingdom), the same verb and idea already in 1:12 (epég- 
geilato). Cf. the beatitude of Jesus in Matt. 5:3 for the 
poor in spirit. 

6. But ye have dishonoured the poor man (humeis de éti- 
masate ton ptochon). First aorist active indicative of ati- 
mazo, old verb from atimos, dishonoured (Matt. 13:57). In 
the act of partiality pictured in 2:3. Oppress you (kata- 
dunasteuousin humon). Not very common compound (kata- 
dunasteud, present active indicative, from kata and dunastés, 
potentate, Luke 1:52), used of the devil in Acts 10-38 (only 
other N.T. example). Examples in papyri of harsh treat- 
ment by men in authority. Already poor Christians are 
feeling pressure from rich Jews as overlords. Drag you 
(helkousin humas). Old and vigorous word for violent treat- 
ment, as of Paul in Acts 16:19; 21:30. Cf. such violence in 
Luke 12:58; Acts 8:3. Before the judgment-seats (eis kriteria). 
“To courts of justice” as in I Cor. 6:2, 4 (only other N.T. 
examples). Common in the papyri in this sense. From 
kriné to judge, krités (judge), place where judgment is given 

7. Blaspheme (blasphémousin). Present active indicative 
of common verb dlasphémed (from blasphémos, speaking evil, 
blax or blapté and phémé), as in Luke 22:65. The honourable 
name (to kalon onoma). ‘‘The beautiful name.” By the 
which ye were called (to epikléthen eph’ humas). “The one 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 31 


called upon you” (first aorist passive articular participle 
of epikaled, to put a name upon, to give a surname to, as 
Acts 10:18). What name’ is that? Almost certainly the 
name of Christ as we see it in Acts 11:26; 26:28; I Pet. 
4:14, 16. It was blasphemy to speak against Christ as some 
Jews and Gentiles were doing (Acts 13:45; 18:6; 26:11; I 
Corena:3; Tims 4 319) Cf Acts 16:17: 

8. Howbe-t (mentoi). Probably not adversative here, but 
simply confirmatory, “if now,” “if indeed,” “‘if really.” 
Common in Xenophon in this sense. See the contrast (de) 
in verse 9. If ye fulfil (ei teleite). Condition of first class, 
assumed as true with ei and present active indicative of 
teled, old verb, to bring to completion, occurring in Rom. 
2:27 also with nomos (law). Jesus used plérod in Matt. 
4:17. James has ¢éred in 2:10. The royal law (nomon basil- 
ikon). Old adjective for royal, regal (from dasileus king), 
as of an officer (John 4:46). But why applied to nomos? 
The Romans had a phrase, /ex regia, which came from the 
king when they had kings. The absence of the article is 
common with nomos (4:11). It can mean a law fit to guide 
a king, or such as a king would choose, or even the king of 
laws. Jesus had said that on the law of love hang all the 
law and the prophets (Matt. 22:40), and he had given the 
Golden Rule as the substance of the Law and the prophets 
(Matt. 7:12). This is probably the royal law which is 
violated by partiality (James 2:3). It is in accord with the 
Scripture quoted here (Lev. 19:18) and ratified by Jesus 
(Luke 10:28). © 

9. But if ye have respect of persons (ei de prosopolempteite). 
Condition of first class by contrast with that in verse 8. 
For this verb (present active indicative), formed from pro- 
sopon lamband, here alone in the N.T., see in 2:1. A direct 
reference to the partiality there pictured. Ye commit sin 
(hamartian ergazesthe). ““Ye work asin.” A serious charge, 
apparently, for what was regarded as a trifling fault. See 


32 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Matt. 7:23, hoi ergazomenoi ten anomian (ye that work 
iniquity), an apparent reminiscence of the words of Jesus 
there (from Ps. 6:8). Being convicted (elegchomenoi). Pres- 
ent passive participle of elegchd, to convict by proof of guilt 
(John 3:20; 8:9, 46; I Cor. 14:24). 4s transgressors (hos 
parabatai). For this word from parabaind, to step across, 
to transgress, see Gal. 2:18; Rom. 2:25, 27. See this very 
sin of partiality condemned in Lev. 19:15; Deut. 1:17; 16:19. 
To the law and to the testimony. 

10. Whosoever shall keep (hostis téréséi). Indefinite rela- 
tive clause with Aostis and aorist active subjunctive of téred, 
old verb, to guard (from /éros guarding), as in Matt. 27:36, 
without am (though often used, but only one example of 
modal ean =an in James, viz., 4:4). This modal an (ean) 
merely interprets the sentence as either more indefinite or 
more definite (Robertson, Grammar, p. 957f.). And yet 
stumble in one point (ptaiséi de en heni). First aorist active 
subjunctive also of ptaid, old verb, to trip, as in 3:2 and 
Rom. 11:11. “It is incipient falling” (Hort). He is become 
(gegonen). Second perfect indicative of ginomai, “‘he has 
become” by that one stumble. Guilty of all (panton enochos). 
Genitive of the crime with enochos, old adjective from enechd 
(to hold on or in), held in, as in Mark 3:29. This is law. 
To be a lawbreaker one does not have to violate all the laws, 
but he must keep all the law (Aolon ton nomon) to be a law- 
abiding citizen, even laws that one does not like. See Matt. 
5:18f. for this same principle. There is Talmudic parallel: 
“Tf a man do all, but omit one, he is guilty for all and each.” 
This is a pertinent principle also for those who try to save 
themselves. But James is urging obedience to all God’s 
laws. 

11. He that said (ho eipon)—said also (eipen kai). The 
unity of the law lies in the Lawgiver who spoke both pro- 
hibitions (mé and the aorist active subjunctive in each one, 
moicheuséis, phoneuséis). The order here is that of B in 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 33 


Ex. 20 (Luke 18:20; Rom. 13:9), but not in Matt. 5:21, 27 
(with ou and future indicative). Now if thou dost not com- 
mit adultery, but killest (ei de ou moicheueis, phoneueis de). 
Condition of first class with ou (not mé) because of the con- 
trast with de, whereas ei mé would mean ‘“‘unless,” a differ- 
ent idea. So ou in 1:23. J transgressor of the law (parabatés 
nomou) as in verse 9. Murder springs out of anger (Matt. 
§:21-26). People free from fleshly sins have often “made 
their condemnation of fleshly sins an excuse for indulgence 
towards spiritual sins” (Hort). 

12. So speak ye, and so do (houtos laleite kai houtos poieite). 
Present active imperatives as a habit. For the combination 
see I:19-21 contrasted with 1:22-25, and 1:26 with 1:27. 
By a law of liberty (dia nomou eleutherias). ‘The law pic- 
tured in 1:25, but law, after all, not individual caprice of 
“personal liberty.” See Rom. 2:12 for this same use of 
dia with krind in the sense of accompaniment as in Rom. 
2:27; 4:11; 14:20. “‘Under the law of liberty.” 

13. Without mercy (aneleos). Found here only save a 
doubtful papyrus example (aze/eds) for the vernacular ani~ 
leds and the Attic anéleés. For this principle of requital 
see Matt. 5:7; 6:14; 7:1f.; 18:33. Glorieth against (katakau- 
chatai). Present middle indicative of the old compound verb 
katakauchaomai, to exult over (down), in N.T. only here, 
3:14; Rom. 11:18. Only mercy can triumph over justice 
with God and men. ‘Mercy is clothed with the divine glory 
and stands by the throne of God” (Chrysostom). See Rom. 
8:31-39; Matt. 9:13; 12:7. 

14. What doth it profit? (ti ophelos;). Rhetorical question, 
almost of impatience. Old word from ophellé, to increase, 
in N.T. only here, verse 16, and I Cor. 15:32. “Ti ophelos 
was a common expression in the vivacious style of a moral 
diatribe”’ (Ropes). Jf @ man say (ean legéi tis). Condition 
of third class with ean and the present active subjunctive 
of lego, “if one keep on saying.” He hath faith (pistin 


34 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


echein). Infinitive in indirect assertion after /egéi. But have 
not works (erga de mé echéi). Third-class condition continued, 
“but keeps on not having (mé and present active subjunc- 
tive echéi) works.” It is the spurious claim to faith that 
James here condemns. Can that faith save him? (mé dunatai 
hé pistis sdsai auton;). Negative answer expected (mé). 
Effective aorist active infinitive sdsai (from 5020). The 
article @ here is almost demonstrative in force as it is in 
origin, referring to the claim of faith without works just 
made. 

15. If a brother or sister be naked (ean adelphos é adelphé 
gumnoi huparchosin). Condition again of third class (sup- 
posable case) with ean and present active subjunctive of 
huparchd, to exist, in the plural though @ (or) is used and 
not kai (and). Hence gumnoi is masculine plural in the 
predicate nominative. It does not here mean absolutely 
naked, but without sufficient clothing as in Matt. 25:36ff.; 
John 21:7; Acts 19:16. In lack of daily food (letpomenoi 
tés ephémerou trophés). Present passive participle of /eipd 
and ablative case trophés like leipetai sophias (1:5). The 
old adjective ephémeros (ho epi hémeran On, that which is 
for a day) occurs here only in the N.T., though ephémeria 
(daily routine) is found in Luke 1:5, 8. This phrase occurs 
in Diodorus, but not in LXX. 

16. And one of you say unto them (eipéi de tis autois ex 
humon). Third-class condition again continued from verse 
15 with second aorist active subjunctive eipéi. Go in peace 
(hupagete en eirénéi). Present active imperative of hupago. 
Common Jewish farewell (Judges 18:6; I Sam. 1:17; 20:42; 
II Sam. 15:9). Used by Jesus (Mark 5:34; Luke 7:50). 
Be ye warmed and filled (thermainesthe kat chortazesthe). 
Present imperative either middle (direct) or passive. We 
have thermainomai as a direct middle in John 18:18 (were 
warming themselves) and that makes good sense here: 
“Warm yourselves.” Chortazd was originally used for pas- 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 35 


turing cattle, but came to be used of men also as here. 
“Feed yourselves” (if middle, as is likely). Instead of warm 
clothes and satisfying food they get only empty words to 
look out for themselves. And yet ye give not (mé dote de). 
Third-class condition with de (and yet) and mé and the 
second aorist active subjunctive of diddmi, to give, cold 
deeds with warm words. . The things needful to the body (ta 
epitédeia tou sdmatos). ‘‘The necessities of the body” (the 
necessaries of life). Old adjective from adverb epitédes 
(enough), only herein N.T. What doth it profit? (ti ophelos;). 
As in verse 14 and here the conclusion (apodosis) of the long 
condition begun in verse 15. 

17. If it have not works (ean mé echéi erga). Another con- 
dition of the third class with eam and mé and the present 
active subjunctive of echd, “‘if it keep on not having works.” 
In itself (kath? heauten). In and of itself (according to it- 
self), inwardly and outwardly dead (nekra). Same idiom 
in Acts 28:16; Rom. 14:22. It is a dead faith. 

18. Yea, a man will say (all erei tis). Future active of 
eipon. But all’ here is almost certainly adversative (But 
someone will say), not confirmatory. James introduces an 
imaginary objector who speaks one sentence: “Thou hast 
faith and I have works” (Su pistin echeis kagd erga echo). 
Then James answers this objector. The objector can be 
regarded as asking a short question: “Hast thou faith?” 
In that case James replies: ““I have works also.” Show me 
thy faith apart from thy works (deixon moi ten pistin sou 
choris ton ergon). This is the reply of James to the objector. 
First aorist active imperative of deiknumi, tense of urgency. 
The point lies in choris, which means not “without,” but 
“apart from,” as in Heb. 11:6 (with the ablative case), ‘‘the 
works that properly belong to it and should characterise it” 
(Hort). James challenges the objector to do this. dnd I 
by my works will shew thee my faith (kagd soi detxo ek ton 
ergin mou tén pistin). It is not faith or works, but proof 


36 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


of real faith (live faith vs. dead faith). The mere profession 
of faith with no works or profession of faith shown to be 
alive by works. This is the alternative clearly stated. Note 
pistin (faith) in both cases. James is not here discussing 
“‘works”’ (ceremonial works) as a means of salvation as 
Paul in Gal. 3 and Rom. 4, but works as proof of faith. 

19. Thou believest that God is one (su pisteueis hoti heis 
theos estin). James goes on with his reply and takes up 
mere creed apart from works, belief that God exists (there 
is one God), a fundamental doctrine, but that is not belief 
or trust in God. It may be mere creed. Thou doest well 
(kalos poieis). That is good as far as it goes, which is not 
far. The demons also believe (kai ta daimonia pisteuousin). 
They go that far (the same verb pisteud). They never 
doubt the fact of God’s existence. And shudder (kai phris- 
sousin). Present active indicative of phrissd, old onomato- 
poetic verb to bristle up, to shudder, only here in N.T. 
Like Latin horreo (horror, standing of the hair on end with 
terror). The demons do more than believe a fact. They 
shudder at it. 

20. But wilt thou know? (theleis de gnonai?). “But dost 
thou wish to know?” Ingressive aorist active infinitive of 
ginosko (come to know). James here introduces a new argu- 
ment like Rom. 13:3. O vain man (6 anthrope kene). Goes 
on with the singular objector and demolishes him. For 
“empty” (deficient) Paul uses aphron (fool) in I Cor. 15:36 
and just anthrope in Rom. 2:1; 9:20. Barren (arge). See 
II Pet. 1:8 (not idle nor unfruitful) and Matt. 12:36, but 
Hort urges “inactive” as the idea here, like money with no 
interest and land with no crops. 

21. Justified by works (ex ergin edikaiothé). First aorist 
passive indicative of dikaiod (see Galatians and Romans for 
this verb, to declare righteous, to set right) in a question 
with ouk expecting an affirmative answer. This is the phrase 
that is often held to be flatly opposed to Paul’s statement in 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 37 


Rom. 4:1-5, where Paul pointedly says that it was the faith 
of Abraham (Rom. 4:9) that was reckoned to Abraham for 
righteousness, not his works. But Paul is talking about the 
faith of Abraham before his circumcision (4:10) as the basis 
of his being set right with God, which faith is symbolized in 
the circumcision. James makes plain his meaning also. In 
that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar (anenegkas 
Isaak ton huion autou epi to thusiasterion). They use the 
same words, but they are talking of different acts. James 
points to the offering (anenegkas second aorist—with first 
aorist ending—active participle of anaphero) of Isaac on the 
altar (Gen. 22:16f.) as proof of the faith that Abraham 
already had. Paul discusses Abraham’s faith as the basis 
of his justification, that and not his circumcision. There is 
no contradiction at all between James and Paul. Neither 
is answering the other. Paul may or may not have seen 
the Epistle of James, who stood by him loyally in the Con- » 
ference in Jerusalem (Acts 15 and Gal. 2). 

22. Thou seest (blepeis). Obvious enough with any eyes 
to see. This may be a question, seest thou? Wrought with 
(sunérgei). Imperfect active of sunerged, old verb for which 
see Rom. 8:28. Followed by associative-instrumental case 
ergois. Faith codperated with the deed of offering up Isaac. 
Was made perfect (eteleiothé). First aorist passive indica- 
tive of teleiod, to carry to the end, to complete like love in 
I John 4:18. See James 1:4 for teleion ergon. 

23. Was fulfilled (eplerothé). First aorist passive indica- 
tive of plérod, the usual verb for fulfilling Scripture. So 
James quotes Gen. 15:6 as proving his point in verse 21 
that Abraham had works with his faith, the very same pas- 
sage that Paul quotes in Rom. 4:3 to show that Abraham's 
faith preceded his circumcision and was the basis of his 
justification. And both James and Paul are right, each to 
illustrate a different point. And he was called the friend of 
God (kai philos theou ekléthé). First aorist passive indicative 


38 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


of kal@o. Not a part of the Scripture quoted. Philo calls 
Abraham the friend of God and ‘see Fubilees 19:9; 30:20. 
The Arabs today speak of Abraham as God’s friend. ‘It 
was evidently a common description before James used ‘it, 
as in Is. 41:8; II Chron. 20:7. 

24. Ye see (horate). Present indicative active of horaé. 
Now he uses the plural again as in 2:14. Is justified (dikai- 
outai). Present passive indicative of dikaiod, here not “‘is 
made righteous,” but “‘is shown to be righteous.” James 
is discussing the proof of faith, not the initial act of being 
set right with God (Paul’s idea in Rom. 4:1-10). And not 
only by faith (kai ouk ek pisteds monon). This phrase clears 
up the meaning of James. Faith (live faith) is what we must 
all have (2:18), only it must shew itself also in deeds as 
Abraham’s did. 

25. Rahab the harlot (Raab hé porné). Wer vicious life 
she left behind, but the name clung to her always. For our 
purposes the argument of James may seem stronger with- 
out the example of Rahab (Josh. 2:1-21, 6:17, 22-25; Matt. 
1:5; Heb. 11:31). It is even said in Jewish Midrash that 
Rahab married Joshua‘and became an ancestor of Jeremiah 
and Ezekiel. In that she received (hupodexamené).: First 
aorist middle participle of hupodechomai, to welcome. The 
messengers (tous aggelous). Original meaning of aggelos 
(Matt. 11:10). In Heb. 11:31 we have kataskopous (spies, 
scouts). Sent out (ekbalousa). Second aorist active par- 
ticiple of ekballé, to hurl out. Another way (heterai hoddi). 
“By another way” (instrumental case), by a window in- 
stead of a door (Josh. 2:15f.). 

26. Apart from the spirit (choris pneumatos). ‘Apart from 
breath” (the breath of life). It is not easy to tell when one 
is dead, but the absence of a sign of breath on a glass before 
the mouth and nose is proof of death. Startling picture of 
dead faith in our churches and church members with only 
a name to live (Rev. 3:2). 


CHAPTER III 


1. Be not many teachers (mé polloi didaskaloi ginesthe). 
Prohibition with mé and present middle imperative of gino- 
mai. ‘Stop becoming many teachers” (so many of you). 
There is thus a clear complaint that too many of the Jewish 
Christians were attempting to teach what they did not 
clearly comprehend. There was a call for wise teachers 
(verses 13f.), not for foolish ones. This soon became an. 
acute question, as one can see in I Cor. 12 to14. They were 
not all teachers (I Cor. 12:28f.; 14:26). The teacher is 
here treated as the wise man (3:13-18) as he ought to be. 
The rabbi was the teacher (Matt. 23:7f.; John 1:38; 3:10; 
20:16). ‘Teachers occupied an honourable position among 
the Christians (Eph. 4:11; Acts 13:1). James counts him- 
self a teacher (we shall receive, 3:1) and this discussion is 
linked on with 1:19-27. Teachers are necessary, but in- 
competent and unworthy ones do much harm. Heavier 
judgment (meizon krima). “Greater sentence.” See Mark 
12:40 and Luke 20:47 for perrisoteron krima (the sentence 
from the judge, Rom. 13:2). The reason is obvious. The 
pretence of knowledge adds to the teacher’s responsibility 
and condemnation. 

2. In many things (polla). Accusative neuter plural either 
cognate with piaiomen or accusative of general reference. 
On ptaiomen (stumble) see on 2:10. James includes him- 
self in this list of stumblers. Jf not (ei-ou). Condition of 
first class with ou (not mé) negativing the verb ptaiei. In 
word (en logoi). In speech. The teacher uses his tongue 
constantly and so is in particular peril on this score. The 
same (houtos). “This one” (not ho autos the same). 4 
perfect man (teleios anér). “A perfect husband” also, for 

39 


40 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


anér is husband as well as man in distinction from woman 
(guné). The wife is at liberty to test her husband by this 
rule of the tongue. To bridle the whole body also (chalina- 
gogesai kai holon to soma). See 1:26 for this rare verb ap- 
plied to the tongue (g/éssan). Here the same metaphor is 
used and shown to apply to the whole body as horses are 
led by the mouth. The man follows his own mouth whether 
he controls the bridle therein (1:26) or someone else holds 
the reins. James apparently means that the man who 
bridles his tongue does not stumble in speech and is able 
also to control his whole body with all its passions. See 
Titus 1:11 about stopping people’s mouths (epistomizé). 

— 3. If we put (ei ballomen). Condition of the first class 
assumed as true. The horses’ bridles (tin hippon tous chalin- 
ous). Hippon (genitive plural of hippos, horse, old word, 
in N.T. only here except in the Apocalypse), put first be- 
cause the first of the several illustrations of the power and 
the peril of the tongue. This is the only N.T. example 
of chalinos, old word for bridle (from chalaé to slacken, 
let down), except Rev. 14:20. That they may obey us (eis to 
petthesthat autous hémin). Present middle infinitive of 
peitho with eis to as a purpose clause with the dative hémin 
after peithesthai and autous the accusative of general refer- 
ence. We turn about (metagomen). Present active indica- 
tive of metago, late compound to change the direction (meta, 
ago), to guide, in N.T. only here and verse 4. The body 
of the horse follows his mouth, guided by the bridle. 

4. The ships also (kai ta ploia). Old word from pled, to 
sail (Matt. 4:21). Another metaphor like “horses” (Aippoi). 
“There is more imagery drawn from mere natural phe- 
nomena in the one short Epistle of James than in all St. 
Paul’s epistles put together” (Howson). Though they are 
$o great (télikauta onta). Concessive participle of eimi. The 
quantitative pronoun /é/ikoutos occurs in the N.T. only here, 
II Cor. 1:10; Heb. 2:3; Rev. 16:18. If James had only seen 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 41 


‘the modern mammoth ships. But the ship on which Paul 
went to Malta carried 276 persons (Acts 27:37). And are 
driven (kai elaunomena). Present passive participle of ela- 
und, old verb, in this sense (II Pet. 2:17) for rowing (Mark 
6:48; John 6:19). Rough (skléron). Old adjective (from 
skelld, to dry up), harsh, stiff, hard (Matt. 25:24). Are yet 
turned (metagetai). Present passive indicative of the same 
verb, metagé, in verse 3. James is fond of repeating words 
(1:13f.; 2:14, 16; 2:21, 25). By @ very small rudder (hupo 
elachistou pédaliou). For the use of hupo (under) with 
things see Luke 8:14; II Pet. 2:7. There is possibly per- 
sonification in the use of hupo for agency in James 1:14; 
2:9; Col. 2:18. Pédaliou (from pédon, the blade of an oar): 
is an old word, in N.T. only here and Acts 27:40. Elachistau 
is the elative superlative as in I Cor. 4:3 (from the Epic 
elachus for mikros). The impulse (hé hormé). Old word for 
rapid, violent motion, here of the hand that worked the 
rudder, in N.T. only here and Acts 14:5 (rush or onset of 
the people). Of the steersman (tou euthunontos). Present 
active genitive articular participle of euthund, old verb, to 
make straight (from euthus, straight, level, Mark 1:3), in 
N.T. only here and John 1:23. Used also of the shepherd, 
the charioteer, and today it would apply to the chauffeur. 
“The twin figure of the control of horse and of ship are 
frequently found together in later Greek writers” (Ropes). 
As in Plutarch and Philo. Wéilleth (bouletai). Present mid- 
dle indicative of Zoulomai, common verb to will. Here in- 
tention of the steersman lies back of the impact of the hand 
on the rudder. 

5. A little member (mikron melos). Melos is old and com- 
mon word for members of the human body (I Cor, 12:12, 
etc.; Rom. 6:13, etc.). Boasteth great things (megala auchet). 
Present active indicative of auched, old verb, here only in 
N.T. The best MSS. here separate megala from aucheo, 
though megalauched does occur in AEschylus, Plato, etc. 


42 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Megala is in contrast with mikron. How much—how small 
(héelikon—hélikén). The same relative form for two indirect 
questions together, “‘What-sized fire kindles what-sized for- 
est?” For double interrogatives see Mark 15:24. The verb 
anaptei is present active indicative of anapfo, to set fire to, 
to kindle (Luke 12:49, only other N.T. example except some 
MSS. in Acts 28:2). Hulén is accusative case, object of 
anaptei, and occurs here only in N.T., though old word for 
forest, wood. Forest fires were common in ancient times 
as now, and were usually caused by small sparks carelessly 
thrown. 

6. The tongue is a fire (hé glossa pur). So necessarily 
since there is no article with pur (apparently same word as 
German feuer, Latin purus, English pure, fire). This meta- 
phor of fire is applied to the tongue in Prov. 16:27; 26:18-22; 
Sirach 28:22. The world of iniquity (ho kosmos tés adikias). 
A difficult phrase, impossible to understand according to 
Ropes as it stands. If the comma is put after pur instead 
of after adikias, then the phrase may be the predicate with 
kathistatai (present passive indicative of kathistémi, ‘is con- 
stituted,” or the present middle “presents itself”). Even 
so, kosmos remains a difficulty, whether it means the “‘or- 
nament” (I Pet. 3:3) or “evil world” (James 1:27) or just 
“world” in the sense of widespread power for evil. The 
genitive adikias is probably descriptive (or qualitative). 
Clearly James means to say that the tongue can play havoc 
in the members of the human body. Which defileth the whole 
body (hé spilousa holon to soma). Present active participle 
of spilod late Koiné, verb, to stain from spilos (spot, also 
late word, in N.T. only in Eph. 5:27; II Pet. 2:13), in N.T. 
only here and Jude 23. Cf. 1:27 aspilon (unspotted). Set- 
teth on fire (phlogizousa). Present active participle of phlo- 
giz0, old verb, to set on fire, to ignite, from phlox (flame), 
in N.T. only in this verse. See anaptei (verse 5). The 
wheel of nature (ton trochon geneseds). Old word for wheel 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 43 


(from ¢rechd, to run), only here in N.T. “One of the hard- 
est passages in the Bible” (Hort). To what does trochon 
refer? For geneseds see 1:23 apparently in the same sense. 
Vincent suggests ‘‘the wheel of birth” (cf. Matt. 1:1, 18). 
The ancient writers often use this same phrase (or kuk/los, 
cycle, in place of ¢rochos), but either in a physiological or a 
philosophical sense. James may have caught the metaphor 
from the current use, but certainly he has no such Orphic 
or Pythagorean doctrine of the transmigration of souls, “the 
unending round of death and rebirth” (Ropes). The wheel 
of life may be considered either in motion or standing stili, 
though setting on fire implies motion. There is no reference 
to the zodiac. And is set on fire by hell (kai phlogizomené 
hupo gehennés). Present passive participle of phlogizd, giv- 
ing the continual source of the fire in the tongue. For the 
metaphor of fire with gehenna see Matt. 5:22. 

7. Kind (phusis). Old word from phué, order of nature 
(Rom. 1:26), here of all animals and man, in II Pet. 1:4 
of God and redeemed men. Of beasts (thérion). Old word 
diminutive from thér and so “‘little beasts” originally, then 
wild animals in general (Mark 1:13), or quadrupeds as here. 
These four classes of animals come from Gen. g:2f. Birds 
(peteindn). Old word for flying animals (from petomaz, to 
fly), as in Matt. 13:4. Creeping things (herpeton). Old 
word from herpd, to crawl (Latin serpo), hence serpents. 
Things in the sea (enalion). Old adjective (en, hals, sea, 
salt) in the sea, here only in N.T. The four groups are 
put in two pairs here by the use of ¢e kai with the first two 
and the second two. See a different classification in Acts 
10:12; 11:6. Is tamed (damazetai). Present passive indica- 
tive of damazé, old verb kin to Latin dominus and English 
tame, in N.T. only in this passage and Mark 5:4. The 
present tense gives the general picture of the continuous 
process through the ages of man’s lordship over the animals 
as stated in Gen. 1:28. Hath been tamed (dedamastai). Per- 


44 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


fect passive indicative of the same verb, repeated to present 
the state of conquest in some cases (domestic animals, for 
instance). By mankind (téi phusei tei anthropinéi). Instru- 
mental case with repeated article and repetition also of 
phusis, “by the nature the human.” For anthropinos see 
Act 1722: 

8. No one (oudeis). Especially his own tongue and by 
himself, but one has the help of the Holy Spirit. 4 restless 
evil (akatastaton kakon). Correct reading, not akatascheton, 
for which see 1:8. The tongue is evil when set on fire by 
hell, not evil necessarily. Full of deadly poison (mesté iou 
thanatéphorou). Feminine adjective agreeing with g/dssa, 
not with kakon (neuter). Jou (poison here, as in Rom. 
3:13, but rust in §:3, only N.T. examples), old word. Geni- 
tive case after mesté (full of). Thanat@phorou, old compound 
adjective (from thanatos, death, pherd, to bear or bring), 
death-bringing. Here only in N.T. Like the restless death- 
bringing tongue of the asp before it strikes. 

9. Therewith (en autzi). This instrumental use of em is 
not merely Hebraistic, but appears in late Koiné writers 
(Moulton, Pro/., pp. 11f., 61f.). See also Rom. 15:6. We 
bless (eulogoumen). Present active indicative of euloged, old 
verb from eulogos (a good word, eu, Jogos), as in Luke 1:64 
of God. “This is the highest function of speech” (Hort). 
The Lord and Father (ton kurion kai patera). Both terms 
applied to God. Curse we (katardmetha). Present middle 
indicative of the old compound verb kataraomai, to curse 
(from katara a curse), as in Luke 6:28. Which are made 
after the likeness of God (tous kath’ homoidsin theou gegonotas). 
Second perfect articular participle of ginomai and homoidsis, 
old word from homoiod (to make like), making like, here only 
in N.T. (from Gen. 1:26; 9:6), the usual word being homo- 
16ma, resemblance (Phil. 2:7). It is this image of God which 
sets man above the beasts. Cf. II Cor. 3:18. 

10. Ought not (ou chre). The only use of this old im- 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 45 


personal verb (from chrad) in the N.T. It is more like 
prepei (it is appropriate) than dei (it is necessary). It is 
a moral incongruity for blessing and cursing to come out 
of the same mouth. So to be (houtos ginesthai). “So to 
keep on happening,” not just “to be,” present middle in- 
finitive of ginomai. . 

11. The fountain (hé pége). Old word for spring (John 
4:14). Opening (opés). Old word for fissure in the earth, 
in N.T. only here and Heb. 11:38 (caves). Send forth 
(ruei). Present active indicative of drud, old verb, to 
bubble up, to gush forth, here only in N.T. The use of 
meti shows that a negative answer is expected in this rhetor 
ical question. The sweet and the bitter (to gluku kai to pikron). 
Cognate accusatives with brucei. Separate articles to dis- 
tinguish sharply the two things. The neuter singular artic- 
ular adjective is a common way of presenting a quality. 
Glukus is an old adjective (in N.T. only here and Rev. 
10:9f.), the opposite of pikron (from old root, to cut, to 
prick), in N.T. only here and verse 14 (sharp, harsh). 

12. Can? (mé dunatai;). Negative answer expected. See 
the same metaphor in Matt. 7:16f. Fig-tree (suké). Old 
and common word (Matt. 21:10f.). Figs (suka). Ripe 
fruit of hé suké. Olives (elaias). Elsewhere in the N.T. 
for olive-trees as Matt. 21:1. Vine (ampelos). Old word 
(Matt. 26:29). Salt water (halukon). Old adjective from 
hals (halas salt), here only in N.T. 

13. Who (Tis). Rhetorical interrogative like Luke 11:11. 
Common in Paul and characteristic of the diatribe. James 
here returns to the standpoint of verse 1 about many teach- 
ers. Speech and wisdom are both liable to abuse (I Cor. 
1:5, 173 2:1-3:20). Wise and understanding (sophos kat 
epistemon). Sophos is used for the practical teacher (verse 
1), epistemon (old word from epistamai, here only in N.T.) 
for an expert, a skilled and scientific person with a tone of 
superiority. In Deut. 1:13, 15; 4:6, the two terms are prac- 


46 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


tically synonyms. Let him shew (deixaté). First aorist ac- 
tive imperative of deiknumi, old verb to show. As about 
faith in 2:18. Emphatic position of this verb. By his good 
life (ek tes kalés anastrophés). For this literary Koiné word 
from anastrephomai (walk, conduct) see Gal. 1:13. Actions 
speak louder than words even in the case of the professional 
wise man. Cf. I Pet. 1:15. In meekness of wisdom (en 
prauteti sophias). As in 1:21 of the listener, so here of the 
teacher. Cf. Matt. 5:5; 11:29 and Zach. 9:9 of King Mes- 
siah quoted in Matt. 21:5. Startling combination. 

14. Bitter jealousy (zélon pikron). Zélos occurs in N.T. 
in good sense (John 2:17) and bad sense (Acts 5:17). Pride 
of knowledge is evil (I Cor. 8:1) and leaves a bitter taste. 
See “root of bitterness” in Heb. 12:14 (cf. Eph. 4:31). 
This is a condition of the first class. Faction (erithian). 
wate word, from erithos (hireling, from eritheud to spin wool), 
a pushing forward for personal ends, partisanship, as in 
Phil. 1:16. In your heart (en tei kardiai humén). The real 
fountain (pégé, verse 11). Glory not (mé katakauchasthe). 
Present middle imperative of katakauchaomai, for which see 
2:13. Wisdom is essential for the teacher. Boasting ar- 
rogance disproves the possession of wisdom. Lie not against 
the truth (pseudesthe kata tés alétheias). Present middle im- 
perative of pseudomai, old verb, to play false, with mé car- 
ried over. Lying against the truth is futile. By your con- 
duct do not belie the truth which you teach; a solemn and 
needed lesson. Cf. Rom. 1:18f., 2:18, 20. 

15. This wisdom (hauté hé sophia). All talk and disproved 
by the life, counterfeit wisdom, not real wisdom (1:5; 3:17). 
Coming down from above (katerchomené anothen). As in 135, 
17. All true wisdom comes from God. Earthly (epigeios). 
Old adjective, on earth (epi, g@), as in John 3:12, then with 
earthly limitations (Phil. 3:19), as here. Sensual (psuchiké). 
Old adjective, belonging to the psuché, the sensuous or ani- 
mal life (I Cor. 2:14 and here). Devilish (daimoniddés). 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 47 


Late adjective from daimonion (demon) and so demoniacal 
or demon-like, here only in N.T. 

16. Confusion (akatastasia). Late word (from akatasta- 
tos, 1:8; 3:8), a state of disorder (I Cor. 14:33). Vile 
(phaulon). Kin to German faul, first slight, ordinary, then 
bad. The steps are cheap, paltry, evil. Opposed to agatha 
(good) in John 5:39. . 

17. First pure (proton men hagné). First in rank and 
time. Hagnos is from the same root as hagios (holy), old 
adjective, pure from fault, not half-good and half-bad, like 
that above. Then peaceable (epeita eiréniké). Old adjective 
from eirené (peace), loving peace here, bringing peace in 
Heb. 12:11 (only N.T. examples). But clearly great as 
peace is, purity (righteousness) comes before peace and 
peace at any price is not worth the having. Hence Jesus 
spurned the devil’s peace of surrender. Gentle (epieikés). 
Old adjective (from eikos, reasonable, fair), equitable (Phil. 
4:5; I Pet. 2:18). No English word renders it clearly. Easy 
to be entreated (eupeithés). Old adjective (eu, peithomai), 
compliant, approachable. Only herein N.T. Mercy (eleous). 
Practical help (2:13, 16). Good fruits (karpon agathon). 
Kaloi karpoi in Matt. 7:17f. Good deeds the fruit of right- 
eousness (Phil. 1:11). Without variance (adiakritos). Late 
verbal adjective (from alpha privative and diakrinod, to 
distinguish). ‘‘Unhesitating,” not doubting (diakrinomenos) 
like the man in 1:6. Here only in N.T. This wisdom does 
not put a premium on doubt. Without hypocrisy (anu- 
pokritos). Late and rare verbal adjective (alpha privative 
and hupokrino). Not hypocritical, sincere, unfeigned (Rom. 
12:9). 

18. Is sown in peace (en eirénéi speiretai). Present pas- 
sive indicative of speird, to sow. The seed which bears the 
fruit is sown, but James catches up the metaphor of karpos 
(fruit) from verse 17. Only in peace is the fruit of right- 
eousness found. For them that make peace (tois potousin 


48 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


eirénén). Dative case of the articular participle of poied. 
See Eph. 2:15 for this phrase (doing peace), and Col. 1:20 
for eirénopoied, of Christ, and Matt. 5:9 for eirénopoioi 
(peacemakers). Only those who act peaceably are entitled 
to peace. 


CHAPTER 1V 


1. Whence (pothen). This old interrogative adverb (here 
twice) asks for the origin of wars and fights. James is 
full of interrogatives, like all diatribes. Wars (polemoi)— 
Jightings (machai). War (polemos, old word, Matt. 24:6) 
pictures the chronic state or campaign, while maché (also 
old word, II Cor. 7:5) presents the separate conflicts or 
battles in the war. So James covers the whole ground by 
using both words. The origin of a war or of any quarrel 
is sometimes hard to find, but James touches the sore spot 
here. Of your pleasures (ek ton hédonon humon). Old word 
from Aédomai. Ablative case here after ek, “out of your 
sinful, sensual lusts,” the desire to get what one does not 
have and greatly desires. That war (ton strateuomendn). 
Present middle articular participle (ablative case agreeing 
with hedonon) of strateud, to carry on a campaign, here as 
in I Pet. 2:11 of the passions in the human body. James 
seems to be addressing nominal Christians, ““among you” 
(en humin). Modern church disturbances are old enough 
in practice. 

2. Ye lust (epithumeite). Present active indicative of 
epithumed, old word (from epi, thumos, yearning passion for), 
not necessarily evil as clearly not in Luke 22:15 of Christ, 
but usually so in the N.T., as here. Coveting what a man 
or nation does not have is the cause of war according to 
James. Ye kill and covet (phoneuete kai zéloute). Present 
active indicatives of phoneud (old verb from phoneus, mur- 
derer) and zé/od, to desire hotly to possess (I Cor. 12:31). 
It is possible (perhaps probable) that a full stop should 
come after phoneuete (ye kill) as the result of lusting and 
not having. Then we have the second situation: ‘“‘Ye covet 

49 


so WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


and cannot obtain (epituchein, second aorist active infini- 
tive of epitugchand), and (as a result) ye fight and war.” 
This punctuation makes better sense than any other and 
is in harmony with verse 1. Thus also the anticlimax in 
phoneuete and zéloute is avoided. Mayor makes the words 
a hendiadys, “‘ye murderously envy.” Ye have not, because 
ye ask not (ouk echete dia to mé aiteisthai humas). James 
refers again to ouk echete (ye do not have) in verse 2. Such 
sinful lusting will not obtain. “Make the service of God 
your supreme end, and then your desires will be such as 
God can fulfil in answer to your prayer’ (Ropes). Cf. 
Matt. 6:31-33. The reason here is expressed by dia and 
the accusative of the articular present middle infinitive of 
aited, used here of prayer to God as in Matt. 7:7f. Humds 
(you) is the accusative of general reference. Note the mid- 
dle voice here as in aifeisthe in 3. Mayor argues that the 
middle here, in contrast with the active, carries more the 
spirit of prayer, but Moulton (Pro/., p. 160) regards the 
distinction between aifed and aiteomai often “an extinct 
subtlety.” 

3. Because ye ask amiss (dioti kakos aiteisthe). Here the 
indirect middle does make sense, “ye ask for yourselves” 
and that is “evilly” or amiss (kakés), as James explains. 
That ye may spend it in your pleasures (hina en tais hédonais 
humon dapanéséte). Purpose clause with hina and the first 
aorist subjunctive of dapanad, old verb from dapané, cost — 
(Luke 14:28 only in N.T.), to squander (Luke 15:14). God 
does not hear prayers like this. 

4. Ye adulteresses (motchalides). Moichoi kai (ye adul- 
terers) is spurious (Syrian text only). The feminine form 
here is a common late word from the masculine moichoi. It 
is not clear whether the word is to be taken literally here as 
in Rom. 7:3, or figuratively for all unfaithful followers of Christ 
(like an unfaithful bride), as in II Cor. 11:1f.; Eph. 5:24~28 
(the Bride of Christ). Either view makes sense in this 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 51 


context, probably the literal view being more in harmony 
with the language of verses 2f. In that case James may 
include more than Christians in his view, though Paul talks 
plainly to church members about unchastity (Eph. 5:3-5). 
Enmity with God (echthra tou theou). Objective genitive 
theou with echthra (predicate and so without article), old 
word from echthros, enemy (Rom. §:10), with eis theon (below 
and Rom. 8:7). Whosoever therefor? would be (hos ean oun 
boulethéi). Indefinite relative clause with fos and modal ean 
and the first aorist passive (deponent) subjunctive of 
boulomai, to will (purpose). 4 friend of the world (philos tou 
kosmou). Predicate nominative with infinitive eimai agreeing _ 
with hos. See 2:23 for philos theou (friend of God). Maketh 
himself (kathistatat). Present passive (not middle) indicative 
as in 3:6, “‘is constituted,” “‘is rendered.” 4n enemy of God 
(echthros tou theou). Predicate nominative and anarthrous 
and objective genitive (theou). 

5. The Scripture (hé graphé). Personification as in Gal. 3:8 
and James 2:23. But no O.T. passage is precisely like this, 
though it is “‘a poetical rendering” (Ropes) of Ex.20:5. The 
general thought occurs also in Gen. 6:3-5; Is. 63:8-16, etc. 
Paul has the same idea also (Gal. 5:17, 21; Rom. 8:6, 8). It 
is possible that the reference is really to the quotation in 
verse 6 from Prov. 3:34 and treating all before as a parenthe- 
sis. There is no way to decide positively. In vain (kends). 
Old adverb (Aristotle) from kenos (2:20), here alone in N.T. 
“Emptily,” not meaning what it says. Made to dwell 
(katoikisen). First aorist active of katoikizd, old verb, to give 
a dwelling to, only here in N.T. Long unto envying (pros 
phthonon epipothei). A difficult phrase. Some even take 
pros phthonon with legei rather than with epipothei, as it 
naturally does go, meaning “jealously.” But even sc, with 
God presented as a jealous lover, does to pneuma refer to the 
Holy Spirit as the subject of epipothei or to man’s spirit as 


52 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


the object of epipothei? Probably the former and epipothet 
then means to yearn after in the good sense as in Phil. 1:8. 

6. More grace (meizona charin). “Greater grace.” Greater 
than what? “Greater grace in view of the greater require- 
ment” (Ropes), like Rom. §:20f. God does this. Wherefore 
(dio). To prove this point James quotes Prov. 3:34. God 
resisteth the proud (ho theos huperéphanois antitassetai). Pres- 
ent middle (direct) indicative of antitassd, old military term, 
to range in battle against, with dative case (Rom. 13:2) as in 
5:6. Huperéphanois (huper, phainomai) is like our vernacu- 
lar “‘stuck-up folks” (Rom. 1:30), “haughty persons.” But 
giveth grace to the humble (tapeinois de didosin charin). 
Anarthrous adjective again, “to humble or lowly persons,” 
for which word see 1:9f. Cf. 2:5-73 5:1-6. 

7. Be subject therefore unto God (hupotagete oun toi thedt). 
Second aorist (ingressive) passive imperative of hupotassé, 
old verb, to range under (military term also). Same form in 
I Pet. 2:23; 5:5. With the dative case thedi (unto God). 
The aorist has the note of urgency in the imperative. Note 
the ten aorist imperatives in verses 7 to 10 (hupotagéte, anti- 
stete, eggisate, katharisate, hagnisate, talaiporésate, penthésate, 
klausate, metatrapéto, tapeinothéte). But resist the devil (anti- 
stéte de toi diaboloi). Second aorist (ingressive) active (in- 
transitive) imperative of anthisté@mi, “take a stand against.” 
Dative case diaboloi. Result of such a stand is that the devil 
will flee (pheuxetai, future middle of pheugod). See I Pet. 
§:8f.; Eph. 6:11f.; Luke 10:17. 

8. Draw nigh to God (eggisate toi thedi). First aorist active 
imperative of eggizd, late verb from eggus (near) as in Matt. 
3:2. With dative case again of personal relation. The 
priests in the sanctuary drew nigh to God (Ex. 19:22), as we 
should now. Cleanse your hands (katharisate cheiras). First 
aorist active imperative of katharizd, to cleanse, from dirt ina 
ritual sense (Ex. 30:19-21; Mark 7:3, 19). Here it is figura- 
tive, as in Hos. 1:16; Ps. 24:4. If we always had clean (from 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 53 


sin) hands and hearts? Ye sinners (hamartoloi). A sharp 
term to strike the conscience, “‘a reproach meant to startle 
and sting” (Ropes). Purify your hearts (hagnisate kardias). 
First aorist active imperative of hagnizd, old verb from 
hagnos (James 3:17), ceremonially (Acts 21:24, 26), but here 
morally as in I Pet. 1:22; I John 3:3. Anarthrous use of 
kardias as of cheiras (wash hands, purify hearts). Ye double- 
minded (dipsuchoi). As in 1:8. 

9. Be afflicted (talaiporésate). First aorist active impera- 
tive talaipored, old verb from talaiporos (Rom. 7:24), to 
endure toils, here only in N.T. Cf. salaiporiais in 5:1. 
Mourn (penthésate). First aorist active imperative of 
penthed, old verb from penthos (mourning, 4:9), as in Matt. 
5:4f. Often in N.T. joined as here with k/aid, to weep 
(Mark 16:10; Luke 6:25). Avcall to the godly sorrow spoken 
of in II Cor. 7:10 (Mayor), like an O.T. prophet. Weep 
(klausate). First aorist active imperative of k/aio. Laughter 
(gelés). Old word from Homer down, only here in N.T. as 
gelad, to laugh (opposite of k/aid), in N.T. only in Luke 
6:21, 25, but katagelad in Luke 8:53 (=Mark 5:40 =Matt. 
9:24). Be turned (metatrapéto). Second aorist passive im- 
perative of metatrepd, old word, to turn about, to transmute, 
in Homer (not in Attic), here only in N.T. Heaviness 
(katépheian). Old word from katéphés (of a downcast look, 
from kata, phaé eyes), hanging down of the eyes like the 
publican in Luke 18:13, here only in N.T. 

10. Humble yourselves (tapeinothéte). First aorist passive 
imperative of tapeinod, old verb from tapeinos (1:9), as in 
Matt. 18:4. The passive here has almost the middle or 
reflexive sense. The middle voice was already giving way 
to the passive. See I Pet. 5:6 for this same form with the 
same promise of exaltation. He shall exalt you (hupsoset 
humas). Future active indicative of hupsod, common verb 
from hupsos (height), used by Jesus in contrast with sapeinod 
as here (Matt. 23:12; Luke 14:11; 18:14). 


4 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


11. Speak not one against another (mé katalaleite allelon). 
Prohibition against such a habit or a command to quit doing 
it, with mé and the present imperative of katalaleo, old com- 
pound usually with the accusative in ancient Greek, in N.T. 
only with the genitive (here, I Pet. 2:12; 3:16). Often harsh 
words about the absent. James returns to the subject of the 
tongue as he does again in 5:12 (twice before, 1:26; 3:1-12). 
Fudgeth (krinon). In the sense of harsh judgment as in 
Matt. 7:1; Luke 6:37 (explained by katadikazo). Not a doer 
of the law, but a judge (ouk poiétés nomou, alla krités). ‘This 
tone of superiority to law is here sharply condemned. James 
has in mind God’s law, of course, but the point is the same 
for all laws under which we live. We cannot select the laws 
which we will obey unless some contravene God’s law, and so 
our own conscience (Acts 4:20). Then we are willing to give 
our lives for our rebellion if need be. 

12. One only (heis). No “only” in the Greek, but heis 
here excludes all others but God. The lawgiver (ho nomo- 
thetes). Old compound (from nomos, tithémi), only here in 
N.T. In Ps.9:20. Cf. nomotheted in Heb. 7:11; 8:6. To save 
(s0sai, first aorist active infinitive of 5020) and to destroy (kai 
apolesai, first aorist active infinitive of apollumi to destroy). 
Cf. the picture of God’s power in Matt. 10:28, a common 
idea in the O.T. (Deut. 32:39; I Sam. 2:16; II Kings 5:7). 
But who art thou? (su de tis ei;). Proleptic and emphatic 
position of sw (thou) in this rhetorical question as in Rom. 
9:20; 14:4. Thy neighbour (ton plésion). “The neighbour” 
as in James 2:8. 

13. Go to now (age nun). Interjectional use of age (from 
ago) as in §:1 (only N.T. instances) with a plural verb (Aoi 
legontes, present active articular participle, ye that say) as is 
common in ancient Greek like ide nun ékousate (Matt. 26:65). 
Today or tomorrow (sémeron é aurion). Correct text (Aleph 
B), not kai (and). Into this city (eis ténde ten polin). Old 
demonstrative 4ode, rare in N.T. (Luke 10:39) save in neuter 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 55 


plural tade (these things Acts 21:11). One would point out 
the city on the map (Mayor) as he made the proposal (we 
will go, poreusometha). And spend a year there (kai poié- 
somen ekei eniauton). Another future (active of poied). ““We 
will do a year there.” 4nd trade (kai emporeusometha). Future 
middle of emporeuomai (en, poreuomai, to go in), old verb 
from emporos (a merchant or trader, a drummer, one going in 
and getting the trade, Matt. 13:45), a vivid picture of the 
Jewish merchants of the time. 4nd get gain (kai kerdésomen). 
Future (Ionic form) active of kerdaind, old verb from kerdos 
(gain, Phil. 1:21), as in Matt. 16:26. 

14. Whereas ye know not (hoitines ouk epistasthe). The 
longer relative hostis defines here more precisely (like Latin 
qui) hoi legontes (ye who say) of verse 13 in a causal sense, 
as in Acts 10:47, ‘““who indeed do not know” (present mid- 
dle indicative of epistamai). What shall be on the morrow 
(t@s aurion). Supply hémeras (day) after aurion. This is 
the reading of B (Westcott) ‘‘on the morrow” (genitive of 
time), but Aleph K L cursives have to #és aurion (“the 
matter of tomorrow’’), while A P cursives have ¢a tés aurion 
(“the things of tomorrow”). The sense is practically the 
same, though /o #@s aurion is likely correct. What ts your 
life? (poia hé xé humon). ‘Thus Westcott and Hort punctu- 
ate it as an indirect question, not direct. Poia is a qualita- 
tive interrogative (of what character). 4 vapour (atmis). 
This is the answer. Old word for mist (like atmos, from which 
our “‘atmosphere”), in N.T. only here and Acts 2:19 with 
kapnou (vapour of smoke (from Joel 2:30). For a little 
time (pros oligon). See same phrase in I Tim. 4:8, pros 
kairon in Luke 8:13, pros horan in John 5:35. That appear- 
eth and then vanisheth away (phainomené epeita kai aphani- 
zomené). Present middle participles agreeing with atmis, 
“appearing, then also disappearing,” with play on the two 
verbs (phainomai, aphaniz0 as in Matt. 6:19, from aphanés 


56 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


hidden Heb. 4:13) with the same root phan (phaino, 
a-phan-és). 

15. For that ye ought to say (anti tou legein humas). “In- 
stead of the saying as to you” (genitive of the articular 
infinitive with the preposition anti and the accusative of 
general reference with /egein), ‘‘instead of your saying.” Jf 
the Lord will (ean ho kurios theléi). Condition of the third 
class with ean and the present active subjunctive (or first 
aorist active theleséi in some MSS). The proper attitude 
of mind (Acts 18:21; I Cor. 4:19; 16:7; Rom. 1:19; Phil. 
2:19, 24; Heb. 6:3), not to be uttered always in words like 
acharm. This Hellenistic formula was common among the 
ancient heathen, as today among modern Arabs like the 
Latin deo volente. This or that (touto é ekeino). Applicable 
to every act. 

16. In your vauntings (en tais alazoniais humon). Old 
word for braggart talk (from alazoneuomai, to act the alazon 
empty boaster Rom. 1:30), common in Aristophanes, in 
N.T. only here and I John 2:16. Glorying (kauchésis). Act 
of glorying, late word from kauchaomai, good if for Christ 
(I Thess. 2:19), bad if for self as here. 

17. To him that knoweth (eidoti). Dative case of second 
perfect participle eidds (from oida), and with the infinitive 
to know how, “‘to one knowing how.” To do good (kalon 
potein). “To do a good deed.” And doeth it not (kai mé 
potounti). Dative again of the present active participle of 
poied, “and to one not doing it.” Cf. “not a doer” (1:23) 
and Matt. 7:26. Sin (hamartia). Unused knowledge of 
one’s duty is sin, the sin of omission. Cf. Matt. 23:23. 


CHAPTER V 


1. Come now, ye rich (age nun hoi plousioi). Exclamatory 
interjection as in 4:13. Direct address to the rich as a class 
as in I Tim. 6:17. Apparently here James has in mind the 
rich as a class, whether believer, as in 1:10f., or unbeliever, 
as in 2:1f., 6. The plea here is not directly for reform, but 
a warning of certain judgment (5:1-6) and for Christians 
“a certain grim comfort in the hardships of poverty” 
(Ropes) in 5:7-11. Weep and howl (klausate ololuzontes). 
“Burst into weeping (ingressive aorist active imperative of 
klaid as in 4:9), howling with grief” (present active par- 
ticiple of the old onomatopoetic verb o/o/uzé, here only in 
N.T., like Latin ululare, with which compare alalazo in 
Matt. 5:38. For your miseries (epi tais talaiporiais humon). 
Old word from falaiporos (Rom. 7:24) and like talaipored 
in James 4:9 (from ¢/a0 to endure and poros a callus). That 
are coming upon you (tais eperchomenais). Present middle 
participle of the old compound eperchomai to come upon, 
used here in futuristic prophetic sense. 

2. Riches (ho ploutos). Masculine singular, but occasion- 
ally neuter ¢o ploutos in nominative and accusative (II Cor. 
8:2). Apparently p/eotos fulness (from pleos full, pimplemi 
to fill). “Wealth.” re corrupted (sesépen). Second per- 
fect active indicative of sép0 (root sap as in sapros, rotten), 
to corrupt, to destroy, here intransitive “‘has rotted.” Only 
here in N.T. On the worthlessness of mere wealth see 
Matt. 6:19, 24. Are moth-eaten (setobrita gegonen). “Have 
become (second perfect indicative of ginomai, singular num- 
ber, though himatia, neuter plural, treated collectively) 
moth-eaten” (sétobrata, late and rare compound from sés, 
moth, Matt. 6:19f. and dratos, verbal adjective of didrosko 

57 


58 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


to eat John 6:13. This compound found only here, Job 
13:28, Sibyll. Orac. Proem. 64). Rich robes as heirlooms, 
but moth-eaten. Vivid picture. Witness the 250 “‘lost 
millionaires” in the United States in 1931 as compared 
with 1929. Riches have wings. 

3. Are rusted (katidtai). Perfect passive indicative (sin- 
gular for chrusos and arguros are grouped as one) of katiod, 
late verb (from ios, rust) with perfective sense of kata, to 
rust through (down to the bottom), found only here, Sir. 
12:11, Epictetus (Diss. 4, 6, 14). Rust (ios). Poison in 
James 3:8; Rom. 3:13 (only N.T. examples of old word). 
Silver does corrode and gold will tarnish. Dioscorides (V.g1) 
tells about gold being rusted by chemicals. Modern chem- 
ists can even transmute metals as the alchemists claimed. 
For a testimony (eis marturion). Common idiom as in Matt. 
8:4 (use of eis with accusative in predicate). Against you 
(humin). Dative of disadvantage as in Mark 6:11 (eis 
marturion autois) where in the parallel passage (Luke 9:5) 
we have. eis marturion ep autous. “To you” will make 
sense, as in Matt. 8:4; 10:18, but “against” is the idea here 
as in Luke 21:13. Shall eat (phagetai). Future middle (late 
form from ephagon) of defective verb esthid, to eat. Your 
Jlesh (tas sarkas). The plural is used for the fleshy parts 
of the body like pieces of flesh (Rev. 17:16; 19:18, 21). 
Rust eats like a canker, like cancer in the body. 4s fire 
(40s pur). Editors differ here whether to connect this phrase 
with phagetai, just before (as Mayor), for fire eats up more 
rapidly than rust, or with the following, as Westcott and 
Hort and Ropes, that is the eternal fire of Gehenna which 
awaits them (Matt. 25:41; Mark 9:44). This interpretation 
makes a more vivid picture for ethésaurisate (ye have laid 
up, first aorist active indicative of thésaurizd, Matt. 6:19 
and see Prov. 16:27), but it is more natural to take it with 
phagetai. 

4- The hire (ho misthos). Old word for wages (Matt. 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 59 


20:8). Labourers (ergatén). Any one who works (ergazo- 
mai), especially agricultural workers (Matt. 9:37). Who 
mowed (ton amésanton). Genitive plural of the articular 
first aorist active participle of amad (from hama, together), 
old verb, to gather together, to reap, here only in N.T. 
Fields (choras). Estates or farms (Luke 12:16). Which is 
of you kept back by fraud (ho aphusterémenos aph’ humon). 
Perfect passive articular participle of aphustered, late com- 
pound (simplex Austereo common as Matt. 19:20), to be 
behindhand from, to fail of, to cause to withdraw, to de- 
fraud. Pitiful picture of earned wages kept back by rich 
Jews, old problem of capital and labour that is with us 
yet in acute form. The cries (hai boai). Old word from 
which 4oad comes (Matt. 3:3), here only in N.T. The stolen 
money “cries out”’ (krazei), the workers cry out for venge- 
ance. That reaped (ton therisanton). Genitive plural of the 
articular participle first aorist active of therizd (old verb 
from theros, sammer, Matt. 24:32), to reap, to harvest while 
summer allows (Matt. 6:26). Have entered (eiseléluthan). 
Perfect active third person plural indicative of eiserchomai, 
old and common compound, to go or come into. This late 
form is by analogy of the aorist for the usual form in -asi. 
Of the Lord of Sabaoth (Kuriou Sabaoth). “Of the Lord of 
Hosts,” quotation from Is. 5:9 as in Rom. 9:29, transliterat- 
ing the Hebrew word for “Hosts,” an expression for the 
omnipotence of God like Pantokrator (Rev. 4:8). God hears 
the cries of the oppressed workmen even if the employers 
are deaf. 

5. Ye have lived delicately (etruphésate). First aorist (con- 
stative, summary) active indicative of truphad, old verb 
from ¢ruphé (luxurious living as in Luke 7:25, from thrupto, 
to break down, to enervate), to lead a soft life, only here 
in N.T. Taken your pleasure (espatalésate). First aorist 
(constative) active indicative of spatalad, late and rare verb 
to live voluptuously or wantonly (from spatalé, riotous liv-

ing, wantonness, once as bracelet), in N.T. only here and 
I Tim. 5:6. Ye have nourished (ethrepsate). First aorist 
(constative) active indicative of trephd, old verb, to feed, 
to fatten (Matt. 6:26). They are fattening themselves like 
sheep or oxen all unconscious of “‘the day of slaughter” 
(en hémerai sphagés, definite without the article) ahead of 
them. For this use of sphagés see Rom. 8:36 (probata 
sphages, sheep for the slaughter, sphagé from sphazd, to 
slay), consummate sarcasm on the folly of sinful rich people. 

6. Ye have condemned (katedikasate). First aorist active 
indicative of katadikazé, old verb (from katadiké, condemna- 
tion, Acts 25:15). The rich controlled the courts of justice. 
Ye have killed the righteous one (ephoneusate ton dikaion). 
First aorist active indicative of phoneud (2:11; 4:2). “The 
righteous one”’ (ton dikaion) is the generic use of the singular 
with article for the class. There is probably no direct refer- 
ence to one individual, though it does picture well the death 
of Christ and also the coming death of James himself, who 
was called the Just (Eus. H.£. 11.23). Stephen (Acts 7:52) 
directly accuses the Sanhedrin with being betrayers and 
murderers (prodotai kai phoneis) of the righteous one (tou 
dikaiou). He doth not resist you (ouk antitassetai humin). 
It is possible to treat this as a question. Present middle 
indicative of antitassd, for which see James 4:6. Without 
a question the unresisting end of the victim (ton dikaion) 
is pictured. With a question (ovk, expecting an affirmative 
answer) God or Lord is the subject, with the final judgment 
in view. There is no way to decide definitely. 

7. Be patient therefore (makrothumésate oun). A direct 
corollary (oun, therefore) from the coming judgment on the 
wicked rich (5:1-6). First aorist (constative) active im- 
perative of makrothumed, late compound (Plutarch, LXX) 
from makrothumos (makros, thumos, of long spirit, not losing 
heart), as in Matt. 18:26. The appeal is to the oppressed 
brethren. Catch your wind for a long race (long-tempered 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 61 


as opposed to short-tempered). See already the exhorta- 
tion to patience (hupomoné) in 1:3f., 12 and repeated in 
5:11. They will need both submission (hupomené 5:11) 
and steadfastness (makrothumia 5:10). Until the coming of the 
Lord (heds tés parousias). The second coming of Christ he 
means, the regular phrase here and in verse 8 for that idea 
(Matt. 24:3, 37, 39; I Thess. 2:19, etc.). The hushandman 
(ho georgos). The worker in the ground (gé, ergo) as in 
Matt. 21:33f. Waiteth for (ekdechetai). Present middle in- 
dicative of ekdechomai, old verb for eager expectation as in 
Acts 17:16. Precious (timion). Old adjective from timé 
(honor, price), dear to the farmer because of his toil for it.. 
See I Pet. 1:19. Being patient over it (makrothumon ep’ 
autoi). Present active participle of makrothumed just used 
in the exhortation, picturing the farmer longing and hoping 
over his precious crop (cf. Luke 18:7 of God). Until it re- 
ceive (heos labei). Temporal clause of the future with eds 
and the second aorist active subjunctive of /amband, vividly 
describing the farmer’s hopes and patience. The early and 
latter rain (proimon kai opsimon). ‘The word for rain (Aueton 
Acts 14:17) is absent from the best MSS. The adjective 
proimos (from proi, early) occurs here only in N.T., though 
old in the form proimos and prois. See Deut. 11:14; Jer. 
5:24, etc. for these terms for the early rain in October or 
November for the germination of the grain, and the latter 
rain (opsimon, from opse, late, here only in N.T.) in April 
and May for maturing the grain. 

8. Ye also (kai humeis). Aswellasthe farmers. Stablish 
(stérixate). First aorist active imperative of stérizd, old verb, 
(from sférigx, a support) to make stable, as in Luke 22:32; 
I Thess. 3:13. Is at hand (éggiken). Present perfect active 
indicative of eggizd, common verb, to draw near (from eggus), 
in James 4:8, for drawing near. Same form used by John in 
his preaching (Matt. 3:2). In I Pet. 4:7 the same word 
appears to have an eschatological sense as apparently here. 


62 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


How “near” or “nigh” did James mean? Clearly, it could 
only be a hope, for Jesus had distinctly said that no one knew 
when he would return. 

g. Murmur not (mé stenazete). Prohibition with mé and 
the present active imperative of stenazd, old verb, to groan. 
“Stop groaning against one another,” as some were already 
doing in view of their troubles. In view of the hope of the 
Second Coming lift up your heads. That ye be not judged 
(hina mé krithéte). Negative purpose clause with hina mé 
and the first aorist passive subjunctive of krind. As already 
indicated (2:12f.; 4:12) and repeated in 5:12. Reminiscence 
of the words of Jesusin Matt. 7:1f. Standeth before the doors 
(pro tin thuron hestéken). Perfect active indicative of 
histemi, “is standing now.” Again like the language of 
Jesus in Matt. 24:33 (epi thurais) and Mark 13:29. Jesus 
the Judge is pictured as ready to enter for the judgment. 

10. For an example (hupodeigma). Late word for the old 
paradeigma, from hupodeiknumi, to copy under, to teach 
(Luke 6:47), here for copy to be imitated as in John 13:15, 
as a warning (Heb. 4:11). Here predicate accusative with 
tous prophétas (the prophets) as the direct object of labete 
(second aorist active imperative of /ambano). Of suffering 
(tés kakopathias). Old word from kakopathés (suffering evil, 
kakopatheo in verse 13 and II Tim. 2:3, 9), here only in N.T. 
Of patience (makrothumias). Like makrothumeod in 5:7. See 
both makrothumia and hupomoné in II Cor. 4:6; Col. 1:11 
(the one restraint from retaliating, the other not easily suc- 
cumbing). In the name of (en toi onomati). As in Jer. 20:9. 
With the authority of the Lord (Deissmann, Bible Studies, 
p- 198). Oxy 

11. We call blessed (makarizomen). Old word (present 
active indicative of makarizd), from makarios (happy), in 
N.T. only here and Luke 1:48. “We felicitate.” As in 
1:3, 12 and Dan. 12:12. Ye have heard (ékousate). First 
aorist (constative) active indicative of akoud. As in Matt. 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 63 


5:21, 27, 33, 38, 43. Ropes suggests in the synagogues. Of 
Fob (I0b). Job did complain, but he refused to renounce 
God (Job 1:21; 2:10; 13:15; 16:19; 19:25f.). He had become 
a stock illustration of loyal endurance. Ye have seen (eidete). 
Second aorist (constative) active indicative of horad. In 
Job’s case. The end of the Lord (to telos kuriou). The con- 
clusion wrought by the Lord in Job’s case (Job 42:12). Full 
of pity (polusplagchnos). Late and rare compound (polus, 
splagchnon), only here in N.T. It occurs also in Hermas 
(Sim. v. 7. 4; Mand. iv, 3). “Very kind.” Merciful 
(oiktirmon). Late and rare adjective (from oikteiro to pity), 
in N.T. only here and Luke 6:36. 

12. Above all things (pro panton). No connection with 
what immediately precedes. Probably an allusion to the 
words of Jesus (Matt. 5:34-37). It is not out of place here. 
See the same phrase in I Pet. 4:8. Robinson (Ephesians, 
p- 279) cites like examples from the papyri at the close of 
letters. Here it means “But especially” (Ropes). Swear 
not (mé omnuete). Prohibition of the habit (or to quit doing 
it if guilty) with mé and the present active imperative of 
omnud. The various oaths (profanity) forbidden (méte, 
thrice) are in the accusative case after omnuete, according to 
rule (ouranon, gén, horkon). The Jews were wont to split 
hairs in their use of profanity, and by avoiding God’s name 
imagine that they were not really guilty of this sin, just as 
professing Christians today use “pious oaths” which violate 
the prohibition of Jesus. Let be (0). Imperative active 
third singular of eimi, late form (I Cor. 16:22) for esto. 
“Your yea be yea” (and no more). A different form from 
that in Matt. 5:37. That ye fall not under judgment (hina mé 
hupo krisin peséte). Negative purpose with hina mé and the 
second aorist active subjunctive of pipfa, to fall. See hina 
mé krithéte in verse 9. Krisis (from krind) is the act of judg- 
ing rather than the judgment rendered (krima James 3:1). 

13. Is any suffering? (kakopathet tis;). See verse to for 


64 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


kakopathia. The verb in N.T. occurs only here and in 
II Tim. 2:3, 9; 4:5. The lively interrogative is common in 
the diatribe and suits the style of James. Among you 
(en humin). As in 3:13. Let him pray (proseuchestho). 
Present middle imperative, “let him keep on praying” 
(instead of cursing as in verse 12). Is any cheerful (euthumei;). 
Present active indicative of euthumed, old verb from euthumos 
(Acts 27:36), in N.T. only here and Acts 27:22, 25. Let him 
sing praise (psalleto). Present active imperative of psallo, 
originally to twang a chord as on a harp, to sing praise to God 
whether with instrument or without, in N.T. only here, I Cor. 
14:15; Rom. 15:9; Eph. 5:19. “‘Let him keep on making 
melody.” 

14. Is any among you sick? (asthenei tis en humin;). 
Present active indicative of asthened, old verb, to be weak 
(without strength), often in N.T. (Matt. 10:8). Let him call 
for (proskalesastho). First aorist (ingressive) middle impera- 
tive of proskaled. Note change of tense (aorist) and middle 
(indirect) voice. Care for the sick is urged in I Thess. 5:14 
(“help the sick”). Note the plural here, “elders of the 
church,” as in Acts 20:17; 15:6, 22; 21:18; Phil. 1:1 (bishops). 
Let them pray over him (proseuxasthisan ep auton). First 
aorist middle imperative of proseuchomai. Prayer for the 
sick is clearly enjoined. Anointing him with oil (aleipsantes 
elaioi). First aorist active participle of a/eiphd, old verb, to 
anoint, and the instrumental case of elaion (oil). The aorist 
participle can be either simultaneous or antecedent with 
proseuxasthosan (pray). See the same use of aleipho elaioi 
in Mark 6:13. The use of olive oil was one of the best 
remedial agencies known to the ancients. They used it 
internally and externally. Some physicians prescribe it 
today. Itis clear both in Mark 6:13 and here that medicinal 
value is attached to the use of the oil and emphasis is placed 
on the worth of prayer. There is nothing here of the pagan 
magic or of the later practice of “extreme unction”’ (after the 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 65 


eighth century). It is by no means certain that aleiphd here 
and in Mark 6:13 means “anoint” in a ceremonial fashion 
rather than “rub” as.it commonly does in medical treatises. 
Trench (N.T. Synonyms) says: “‘4/eiphein is the mundane 
and profane, chriein the sacred and religious, word.” At 
bottom in James we have God and medicine, God and the 
doctor, and that is precisely where we are today. The best 
physicians believe in God and want the help of prayer. 

15. The prayer of faith (hé euché tés pisteds). Cf. 1:6 for 
prayer marked by faith. Shall save (sdsei). Future active 
of s0z0, to make well. As in Matt. 9:21f.; Mark 6:56. No 
reference here to salvation of the soul. The medicine does 
not heal the sick, but it helps nature (God) do it. The 
doctor codperates with God in nature. The sick (ton kam- 
nonta). Present active articular participle of kamnd, old 
verb, to grow weary (Heb. 12:3), to be sick (here), only 
N.T. examples. The Lord shall raise him up (egerei auton 
ho kurios). Future active of egeird. Precious promise, but 
not for a professional “‘faith-healer” who scoffs at medicine 
and makes merchandise out of prayer. And if he have com- 
mitted sins (kan hamartias @i pepoiékos). Periphrastic per- 
fect active subjunctive (unusual idiom) with kai ean (crasis 
kdn) in condition of third class. Supposing that he has 
committed sins as many sick people have (Mark 2:5ff.; 
John 5:14; 9:2f.; I Cor. 11:30). It shall be forgiven him 
(aphethésetai autdi). Future passive of aphiémi (impersonal 
passive as in Matt. 7:2, 7; Rom. 10:10). Not in any magical 
way, not because his sickness has been healed, not without 
change of heart and turning to God through Christ. Much 
is assumed here that is not expressed. 

16. Confess therefore your sins one to another (exomolo- 
geisthe oun allélois tas hamartias). Present middle (indirect) 
of exomologed. Confession of sin to God is already assumed. 
But public confession of certain sins to one another in the 
meetings is greatly helpful in many ways. This is not con- 


66 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


fessing to one man like a priest in place of the public con- 
fession. One may confess to the pastor without confessing 
to God or to the church, with little benefit to anybody. 
Pray for one another (proseuchesthe huper allélin). Present 
middle imperative. Keep this up. That ye may be healed 
(hopos iathéte). Purpose clause with hopds and the first 
aorist passive subjunctive of iaomai. Probably of bodily 
healing (verse 14), though iaomai is used also of healing of 
the soul (Matt. 13:15; I Pet. 2:24; Heb. 12:13) as Mayor 
takes it here. vaileth much (polu ischuei). ‘‘Has much 
force.” Present active indicative of ischud (from ischus, 
strength). Jn its working (energoumené). Probably the 
present middle participle of energed as Paul apparently uses 
it in Gal. 5:6; I] Cor. 4:12; II Thess. 2:7, meaning “when 
it works.” The passive is possible, as is the usual idiom 
elsewhere. Mayor argues strongly for the passive here, 
“when it is exercised” (Ropes). 

17. Of like passions with us (homoiopathés hémin). As- 
sociative-instrumental case hémin as with homoios. This old 
compound adjective (homoios, pascho), suffering the like with 
another, in N.T. only here and Acts 14:15. He prayed 
fervently (proseuchéi proséuxato). First aorist middle in- 
dicative of proseuchomai and the instrumental case proseu- 
chéi (cognate substantive), after idiom for intensity in clas- 
sical Greek, like pheugein phugéi, to flee with all speed 
(figura etymologica), but particularly frequent in the LXX 
(Gen. 2:17; 31:30) in imitation of the Hebrew infinitive 
absolute. So Luke 22:15; John 3:29; Acts 4:17. That it 
might not rain (tou mé brexai). Genitive of the articular 
infinitive (4rexai, first aorist active of brechd, old verb, to 
moisten, Luke 7:38, to rain, Matt. 5:45) with negative me 
used either for direct purpose, for an object clause as here 
and Acts 3:12; 15:20, or even for result. For three years and 
six months (eniautous treis kai ménas hex). Accusative of 
extent of time. | 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 67 


18. Gave rain (hueton eddken). This idiom is in the LXX 
of God as here of heaven (I Sam. 12:17; I Kings 18:1) and 
also in Acts 14:17 instead of ebrexen of verse 17. Hueton 
is old word for rain (from Aud, to rain), genuine here, but 
not in verse 7. Brought forth (eblastésen). First aorist ac- 
tive of dlastand, old verb, to sprout (intransitive as Mark 
4:27), here as occasionally in later Greek transitive with 
accusative karpon. 

19. If any one among you do err (ean tis en humin plané- 
thei). Third-class condition (supposed case) with ean and 
the first aorist passive subjunctive of planaéd, old verb, to 
go astray, to wander (Matt. 18:12), figuratively (Heb. 5:2). 
From the truth (apo tés alétheias). For truth see 1:18; 3:14; 
John 8:32; I John 1:6; 3:18f. It was easy then, and is now, 
to be led astray from Christ, who is the Truth. 4nd one 
convert him (kai epistrepséi tis auton). Continuation of the 
third-class condition with the first aorist active subjunctive 
of epistrephd, old verb, to turn (transitive here as in Luke 
1:16f., but intransitive often as Acts 9:35). 

20. Let him know (ginosketo). Present active imperative 
third person singular of gindskd, but Westcott and Hort read 
ginoskete (know ye) after B. In either case it is the con- 
clusion of the condition in verse 19. He which converteth 
(ho epistrepsas). First aorist active articular participle of 
epistrepho of verse 19. From the error (ek planés). “Out of 
the wandering” of verse 19 (plané, from which planaé is 
made). See I John 4:6 for contrast between “truth” and 
“error.” 4 soul from death (psuchéen ek thanatou). The soul 
of the sinner (Aamartolon) won back to Christ, not the soul 
of the man winning him. A few MSS. have autou added 
(his soul), which leaves it ambiguous, but aufou is not gen- 
uine. It is ultimate and final salvation here meant by the 
future (sdsei). Shall cover a multitude of sins (kalupset 
plethos hamartion). Future active of kaluptd, old verb, to 
hide, to veil. But whose sins (those of the converter or the 


68 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


converted)? The Roman Catholics (also Mayor and Ropes) 
take it of the sins of the converter, who thus saves himself 
by saving others. The language here will allow that, but 
not New Testament teaching in general. It is apparently 
a proverbial saying which Resch considers one of the un- 
written sayings of Christ (Clem. Al. Paed. iii. 12). It oc- 
curs also in I Pet. 4:8, where it clearly means the sins of 
others covered by love as a veil thrown over them. The 
saying appears also in Prov. 10:12: “Hatred stirs up strife, 
but love hides all transgressions” —that is “love refuses to 
see faults” (Mayor admits). That is undoubtedly the mean- 
ing in I Pet. 4:8 and James §:20.

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


THE AUTHOR 


The Epistle is not anonymous, but claims to be written 
by ‘‘Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ” (1:1), that is Cephas 
(Simon Peter). If this is not true, then the book is pseu- 
donymous by a late writer who assumed Peter’s name, as 
in the so-called Gospel of Peter, Apocalypse of Peter, etc. 
“There is no book in the New Testament which has earlier, - 
better, or stronger attestation, though Irenzus is the first 
to quote it by name” (Bigg). Eusebius (H.EZ. i. Gee) 
places it among the acknowledged books, those accepted 
with no doubt at all. We here assume that Simon Peter 
wrote this Epistle or at any rate dictated it by an amanu- 
ensis, as Paul did in Romans (16:22). Bigg suggests Sil- 
vanus (Silas) as the amanuensis or interpreter (I Pet. 5:12), 
the obvious meaning of the language (dia, through). He 
may also have been the bearer of the Epistle. It happens 
that we know more of Peter’s life than of any of the twelve 
apostles because of his prominence in the Gospels and in 
the first fifteen chapters of the Acts. In the Student's 
Chronological New Testament 1 have given a full list of the 
passages in the Gospels where Peter appears with any clear- 
ness and the material is rich and abundant. The account 
in Acts is briefer, though Peter is the oustanding man in 
the first five chapters during his career in Jerusalem. After 
the conversion of Saul he begins to work outside of Jeru- 
salem and after escaping death at the hands of Herod 
Agrippa I (Acts 12:3ff.) he left for a while, but is back in 
Jerusalem at the Conference called by Paul and Barnabas 
(Acts 15:6-14; Gal. 2:1-10). After that we have no more 

71 


72 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


about him in Acts, though he reappears in Antioch and is 
rebuked by Paul for cowardice because of the Judaizers 
(Gal. 11-21). He travelled for the Gospel among the Jews 
of the Dispersion (Gal. 2:9) with his wife (I Cor. 9:5), and 
went to Asia Minor (I Pet. 1:1) and as far as Babylon or 
Rome (I Pet. 5:13). Besides Silvanus he had John Mark 
with him also (I Pet. 5:13), who was said by the early 
Christian writers to have been Peter’s “interpreter” in his 
preaching, since Peter was not expert in the Greek (Acts 
4:13), and who also wrote his Gospel under the inspiration 
of Peter’s preaching. We are not able to follow clearly the 
close of his life or to tell precisely the time of his death. 
He was apparently put to death in a.p. 67 or 68, but some 
think that he was executed in Rome in a.p. 64. 


Tue Date 


This question is tied up with that of the genuineness of 
the Epistle, the time of Peter’s death, the use of Paul’s 
Epistles, the persecution referred to in the Epistle. As- 
suming the genuineness of the Epistle and the death of 
Peter about a.p. 67 or 68 and the persecution to be not that 
under Domitian or Trajan, but under Nero, the date can 
be assumed to be about a.p. 65. 


Tue Use or Paut’s Episties 


There are two extremes about the relation of Peter to 
Paul. One is that of violent antithesis, with Peter and Paul 
opposing one another by exaggerating and prolonging Paul’s 
denunciation of Peter’s cowardice in Antioch (Gal. 2:11-21) 
and making Peter also the exponent of a Jewish type of 
Christianity (practically a Judaizing type). This view of 
Baur once had quite a following, but it has nearly disap- 
peared. Under its influence Acts and Peter’s Epistles were 
considered not genuine, but documents designed to patch 
up the disagreement between Peter and Paul. The other 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 73 


extreme is to deny any Pauline influence on Peter or of 
Peter on Paul. Paul was friendly to Peter (Gal. 1:18), but 
was independent of his ecclesiastical authority (Gal. 2:1-10) 
and Peter championed Paul’s cause in the Jerusalem Con- 
ference (Acts 15:7-13). Peter was certainly not a Judaizer 
(Acts 11:1-18), in spite of his temporary defection in Anti- 
och. Undoubtedly Peter was won back to cordial relations 
with Paul if any confidence can be placed in II Pet. 3:15f. 
There is no reason for doubting that Peter was familiar 
with some of Paul’s Epistles as there indicated. There is 
some indication of Peter’s use of Romans and Ephesians in 
this Epistle. It is not always conclusive to find the same - 
words and even ideas which are not formally quoted, be- 
cause there was a Christian vocabulary and a body of 
doctrinal ideas in common though with personal variations 
in expression. Peter may have read James, but not the 
Pastoral Epistles. There are points of contact with Hebrews 
which Von Soden considers sufficiently accounted for by 
the fact that Peter and the author of Hebrews were con- 
temporaries. 


Tue PERSECUTION PICTURED IN THE EPISTLE 


Peter himself knew what persecution was at the hands 
of the Sanhedrin and of Herod Agrippa I (both church and 
state). If First Peter was written A.D. 65, there was time 
enough for the persecution of Nero in Rome in A.D. 64 to 
spread to Asia Minor. The province easily imitated the 
capital city. Paul’s life in the Acts and his Epistles abun- 
dantly show how early persecution arose in Asia Minor. 
The Apocalypse, written during the reign of Domitian, 
shows that persecution from the state had been on hand 
long before and was an old burden. We know too little of 
the history of Christianity in Asia Minor from a.p. 60 to 
70 to deny that the fiery trials and suffering as a Christian 


74 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(I Pet. 4:16) can be true of this period. So we locate the 
persecution at this time as an echo from Rome. 


Tue Puiace or WrirtInc 


Peter states that he is in Babylon (I Pet. 5:13), appar- 
ently with his wife (I Cor. 9:5). It is not certain whether 
he means actual Babylon, where Jews had been numerous, 
or mystical Babylon (Rome) as in the Apocalypse. We 
do not know when Rome began to be called Babylon. It 
may have started as a result of Nero’s persecution of the 
Christians after the burning of Rome. The Christians were 
called “‘evil-doers” (I Pet. 2:12) in the time of Nero (Taci- 
tus, dun. XV. 44). So we can think of Rome as the place 
of writing and that Peter uses “Babylon” to hide his actual 
location from Nero. Whether Peter came to Rome while 
Paul was still there we do not know, though John Mark 
was there with Paul (Col. 4:10). “At the time when it 
was written Babylon had not yet unmasked all its terrors, 
and the ordinary Christian was not in immediate danger of 
the tunica ardens, or the red-hot iron chair, or the wild 
beasts, or the stake” (Bigg). 


Tue READERS 


Peter writes “to the elect who are sojourners of the Dis- 
persion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia” 
(1:1). These five Roman provinces are naturally given from | 
the standpoint of Babylon. In Galatia and Asia Paul had 
labored, though not all over these provinces. At any rate, 
there is no reason to wonder that Peter should himself 
work in the same regions where Paul had been. In a gen- 
eral way Paul and Peter had agreed on separate spheres of 
activity, Paul to the Gentiles and Peter to the Jews (Gal. 
21:7ff.), though the distinction was not absolute, for Paul 
usually began his work in the Jewish synagogue. Probably 
the readers are mainly Jewish Christians. but not to the 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 75 


exclusion of Gentiles. Peter has clearly Paul’s idea that 
Christianity is the true Judaism of God’s promise (I Pet. 
24-10). 


THE Purpose 


Evidently Peter’s object is to cheer and strengthen the 
Christians in these five provinces who are undergoing fiery 
trials (1:7f.). There is every reason why Peter, as the lead- 
ing apostle to the circumcision, should write to these be- 
lievers in the provinces, especially since Paul’s long imprison- 
ment in Caesarea and Rome had removed him from his 
accustomed activities and travel. 


THE STYLE AND VOCABULARY 


Like Peter’s discourses in the Acts, the Epistle is mainly 
hortatory, with a minimum of argument and little of the 
closely knit reasoning seen in Romans. There is frequent 
use of the LXX and the Greek is decent Koiné with little 
of the uncouth Aramaic of the Galilean (Matt. 26:73), or 
of the vernacular Koiné as seen in the papyri or in II Peter 
(Acts 4:13). This fact may be accounted for by the help 
of Silvanus as amanuensis. There are sixty-two words in 
the Greek of the Epistle not occurring elsewhere in the 
N.T. There is verbal iteration as in II Peter. ‘“‘One idea 
haunts the whole Epistle; to the author, as to the patriarch 
Jacob, life is a pilgrimage; it is essentially an old man’s 
view” (Bigg). But it is an old man who has lived long with 
Christ. Peter has learned the lesson of humility and pa- 
tience from Jesus his Lord.

CHAPTER I 


1. Peter (Petros). Greek form for the Aramaic (Chaldaic) 
Cephas, the nickname given Simon by Jesus when he first 
saw him (John 1:42) and reaffirmed in the Greek form on 
his great confession (Matt. 16:18), with an allusion to petra, 
another form for a rock, ledge, or cliff. In II Peter 1:1 we 
have both Simon and Petros. Paul in his Epistles always 
terms himself Paul, not Saul. So Peter uses this name, not 
Cephas or Simon, because he is writing to Christians scat- 
tered over Asia Minor. The nominative absolute occurs 
here as in James 1:1, but without chairein as there, the 
usual form of greeting in letters (Acts 23:26) so common in 
the papyri. An apostle of Fesus Christ (apostolos Tésou 
Christou). This is his official title, but in II Pet. 1:1 doulos 
is added, which occurs alone in James 1:1. In II and III 
John we have only ho presbuteros (the elder), as Peter terms 
himself sunpresbuteros in I Pet. 5:1. Paul’s usage varies 
greatly: only the names in I and II Thessalonians, the title 
apostolos added and defended in Galatians and Romans as 
also in I and II Corinthians and Colossians and Ephesians 
and II Timothy with ‘“‘by the will of God” added, and in 
I Timothy with the addition of “according to the command 
of God.” In Philippians Paul has only ‘‘doulos (slave) 
Christou Iésou,” like James and Jude. In Romans and 
Titus Paul has both doulos and apostolos, like II Peter, 
while in Philemon he uses only desmios (prisoner) Jésou 
Christou. To the elect (eklektois). Without article (with the 
article in Matt. 24:22, 24, 31) and dative case, “‘to elect 
persons” (viewed as a group). Bigg takes ek/ektois (old, but 
rare verbal adjective from ek/egd, to pick out, to select) as 
an adjective describing the next word, ‘“‘to elect sojourn- 

78 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 49 


ers.” That is possible and is like genos eklekton in 2:9. See 
the distinction between k/étoi (called) and ek/ektoi (chosen) 
in Matt. 22:14. Who are sojourners (parepidémois). Late 
double compound adjective (para, epidé@mountes, Acts 2:10, 
to sojourn by the side of natives), strangers sojourning for 
a while in a particular place. So in Polybius, papyri, in 
LXX only twice (Gen. 23:4; 38 or 39 12), in N.T. only 
here, 2:11; Heb. 11:13. The picture in the metaphor here 
is that heaven is our native country and we are only tem- 
porary sojourners here on earth. Of the Dispersion (dias- 
poras). See John 7:35 for literal sense of the word for scat- 
tered (from diaspeird, to scatter abroad, Acts 8:1) Jews 
outside of Palestine, and James 1:1 for the sense here to 
Jewish Christians, including Gentile Christians (only N.T. 
examples). Note absence of the argicle, though a definite 
conception (of the Dispersion). The Christian is a pilgrim 
on his way to the homeland. These five Roman provinces 
include what we call Asia Minor north and west of the 
Taurus mountain range (Hort). Hort suggests that the 
order here suggests that Silvanus (bearer of the Epistle) 
was to land in Pontus from the Euxine Sea, proceed through 
Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, to Bithynia, where he would re- 
embark for Rome. This, he holds, explains the separation 
of Pontus and Bithynia, though the same province. Only 
Galatia and Asia are mentioned elsewhere in the N.T. as 
having Christian converts, but the N.T. by no means gives 
a full account of the spread of the Gospel, as can be judged 
from Col. 1:6, 23. 

2. According to (kata). Probably to be connected with 
eklektois rather than with apostolos in spite of a rather loose 
arrangement of words and the absence of articles in verses 
1 and 2. The foreknowledge (prognosin). Late substantive 
(Plutarch, Lucian, papyri) from progindsk6é (1:20), to know 
beforehand, only twice in N.T. (here and Acts 2:23 in Peter’s 
sermon). In this Epistle Peter often uses substantives 


80 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


rather than verbs (cf. Rom. 8:29). Of God the Father (theou 
patros). Anarthous again and genitive case. See pater ap- 
plied to God also in 1:3, 17 as often by Paul (Rom. 1:7, etc.). 
Peter here presents the Trinity (God the Father, the Spirit, 
Jesus Christ). In sanctification of the Spirit (en hagiasmot 
pneumatos). Clearly the Holy Spirit, though anarthrous 
like theou patros. Late word from hagiazd, to render holy 
(hagios), to consecrate, as in 1 Thess. 4:7. The subjective 
genitive here, sanctification wrought by the Spirit as in 
2 Thess. 2:13 (where the Trinity mentioned as here). Unto 
obedience (eis hupakoén). Obedience (from hupakoué, to 
hear under, to hearken) to the Lord Jesus as in 1:22 “to 
the truth,” result of “the sanctification.” And sprinkling 
of the blood of Fesus Christ (rantismon haimatos Iésou Chris- 
tou). Late substantive from rantizd, to sprinkle (Heb. 9:13), 
a word used in the LXX of the sacrifices (Numb. 19:9, 13, 
20, etc.), but not in any non-biblical source so far as known, 
in N.T. only here and Heb. 12:24 (of the sprinkling of blood). 
Reference to the death of Christ on the Cross and to the 
ratification of the New Covenant by the blood of Christ as 
given in Heb. g:19f.; 12:24 with allusion to Ex. 24:3-8. 
Paul does not mention this ritual use of the blood of Christ, 
but Jesus does (Matt. 26:28=Mark. 14:24). Hence it is 
not surprising to find the use of it by Peter and the author 
of Hebrews. Hort suggests that Peter may also have.an 
ulterior reference to the blood of the martyrs as in Rev. | 
7:14f.; 12:11, but only as illustration of what Jesus did for 
us, not as having any value. The whole Epistle is a com- 
mentary upon prognosis theou, hagiasmos pneumatos, haima 
Christou (Bigg). Peter is not ashamed of the blood of Christ. 
Be multiplied (pléthuntheié). First aorist passive optative 
(volitive) of pléthund, old verb (from plethus, fulness), in a 
wish. So in II Pet. 1:2 and Jude 2, but nowhere else in 
N.T. salutations. Grace and peace (charis kai eiréné) occur 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 81 


together in II Pet. 1:2, in II John 2 (with e/eos), and in all 
Paul’s Epistles (with e/eos added in I and II Timothy). 

3. Blessed be (eulogétos). No copula in the Greek (estd, 
let be, or estin, is, or eié, may be). The verbal adjective 
(from euloged) occurs in the N.T. only of God, as in the 
LXX (Luke 1:68). See also II Cor. 1:3; Eph. 1:3. The 
God and Father of our Lord Fesus Christ (ho theos kai patér 
tou kuriou hémon Iésou Christou). ‘This precise language in 
II Cor. 1:3; Eph. 1:3; and part of it in II Cor. 11:31, Rom. 
15:6. See John 20:17 for similar language by Jesus. Great 
(polu). Much. Begat us again (anagennésas hemas). First 
aorist active articular (40, who) participle of anagennad, — 
late, and rare word to beget again, in Aleph for Sirach 
(Prol. 20), in Philo, in Hermetic writings, in N.T. only here 
and verse 23. “It was probably borrowed by the New 
Paganism from Christianity” (Bigg). The Stoics used ana- 
gennésis for palingenesia (Titus 3:5). If andthen in John 
3:3 be taken to mean “again,” the same idea of regeneration 
is there, and if “from above” it is the new birth, anyhow. 
Unto a living hope (eis elpida zosan). Peter is fond of the 
word “living” (present active participle of za) as in 1:23; 
2:4, 5, 24; 4:5, 6. The Pharisees cherished the hope of the 
resurrection (Acts 23:6), but the resurrection of Jesus gave 
it proof and permanence (I Cor. 15:14, 17). It is no longer 
a dead hope like dead faith (James 2:17, 26). This revival 
of hope was wrought “by the resurrection of Jesus Christ” 
(dia anastaseos). WHope rose up with Christ from the dead, 
though the disciples (Peter included) were slow at first to 
believe it. 

4. Unto an inheritance (eis kleronomian). Old word (from 
kléronomos, heir) for the property received by the heir 
(Matt. 21:38), here a picture of the blessedness in store for 
us pilgrims (Gal. 3:18). Incorruptible (aphtharton). Old 
compound adjective (alpha privative and phtheird, to cor- 
rupt), imperishable. So many inheritances vanish away 


82 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


before they are obtained. Undefiled (amianton). Old verbal 
adjective (note alliteration) from alpha privative and miainé, 
to defile, without defect or flaw in the title, in N.T. only 
here, Jamcs 1:27; Heb. 13:4. That fadeth not away (ama- 
ranton). Alliterative and verbal adjective again from alpha 
privative and maraino (to dry up, to wither, as in James 
1:11), late and rare word in several inscriptions on tombs, 
here only in N.T. These inscriptions will fade away, but 
not this inheritance in Christ. It will not be like a faded 
rose. Reserved (tetér?emenén). Perfect passive participle of 
téred, old verb, to take care of, to guard. No burglars or 
bandits can break through where this inheritance is kept 
(Matt. 6:19f.; John 17:11f.). Cf. Col. 1:5, where “laid 
away” (apokeimenén) occurs. For you (eis humas). More 
graphic than the mere dative. 

5. By the power of God (en dunamei theou). No other 
dunamis (power) like this (Col. 1:3). Are guarded (phrou- 
roumenous). Present (continuous process) passive articular 
(tous) participle of phroured, to garrison, old verb (from 
phrouros sentinel), a military term (Acts 9:24; II Cor. 
11:32), used of God’s love (Phil. 4:7) as here. “The in- 
heritance is kept; the heirs are guarded” (Bengel). Through 
faith (dia pisteds). Intermediate agency (dia), the immedi- 
ate being (ev, in, by) God’s power. Unto a salvation (eis 
sotérian). Deliverance is the goal (eis) of the process and 
final salvation here, consummation as in I Thess. 5:8, from © 
sotér (Saviour, from 5020, to save). Ready (hetoimén). Pre- 
pared awaiting God’s will (Gal. 3:23; Rom. 8:18). To be 
revealed (apokaluphthenai). First aorist passive infinitive of 
apokalupto, to unveil. Cf. Col. 3:4 for phanerod (to mani- 
fest) in this sense. In the last time (en kairoi eschatoi). 
This precise phrase nowhere else, but similar ones in John 
6:39; Acts 2:17; James 5:3; II Tim. 3:1; II Pet. 3:3; Heb. 
1:2; Jude 18; I John 2:18. Hort translates it here “in a 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER — 83 


season of extremity,” but it is usually taken to refer to the 
Day of Judgment. That day no one knows, Jesus said. 

6. Wherein (en hoi). This translation refers the relative 
hadi to kairdi, but it is possible to see a reference to Christou 
(verse 3) or to theou (verse 5) or even to the entire content 
of verses 3 to 5. Either makes sense, though possibly 
kairdi is correct. Ye greatly rejoice (agalliasthe). Present 
middle indicative (rather than imperative) of agalliaomat, 
late verb from agallomai, to rejoice, only in LXX, N.T., 
and ecclesiastical literature as in Matt. 5:12. Now for a 
little while (oligon arti). Accusative case of time (o/igon) 
probably as in Mark 6:31, though it can be used of space 
(to a small extent) as in Luke 5:3. If need be (ei deon). - 
Present active neuter singular participle of dei (it is neces- 
sary). Some MSS. have estin after deon (periphrastic con- 
struction). Condition of first class. Though ye have been 
put to grief (Jupéthentes). First aorist passive participle 
(concessive circumstantial use) of /uped, to make sorrowful 
(from Jupé, sorrow), old and common verb. See II Cor. 
6:10. In manifold temptations (en poikilois peirasmois). Just 
the phrase in James 1:2, which see for discussion. “Trials” 
clearly right here as there. Seven N.T. writers use potkilos 
(varied). 

7. The proof of your faith (to dokimion humon tes pisteds). 
The identical phrase in James 1:3 and probably derived from 
there by Peter. See there for discussion of to dokimion (the 
test or touchstone of faith). Being more precious (polutimo- 
teron). No word for “‘being” (oz) in the Greek. The sec- 
ondary uncials have polu timidteron. The text is the 
comparative of polutimos, late adjective (Plutarch) from 
polu and timé (of great price) as in Matt. 1 3:46. Than gold 
(chrusiou). Ablative case after the comparative adjective. 
That perisheth (tou apollumenou). Present middle articular 
participle of apollumi to destroy. Even gold perishes (wears 
away). Though it is proved by fire (dia puros de dokimazo- 


84 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


menou). Present passive articular participle (in the ablative 
like chrusiou) of dokimazd (common verb for testing metals) 
with de, which gives a concessive sense to the participle 
Faith stands the test of fire better than gold, but even gold 
is refined by fire. That might be found (hina heurethéi). 
Purpose clause with Aina and the first aorist passive subjunc- 
tive of heuriskd, common verb, to find. As in II Pet. 3:14, 
this is the result of the probation by God as the Refiner of 
hearts. Unto praise and glory and honour (eis epainon kai 
doxan kai timén). Here probably both to God and man in 
the result. Cf. Matt. 5:11f.; Rom. 277,10; )/Mim has. it 
the revelation of Fesus Christ (en apokalupsei Iésou Christou). 
So also in 1:13; 4:13; II Thess. 1:7; I Cor. 1:7; Luke 17:30 of 
the second coming of Christ as the Judge and Rewarder (Bigg). 

8. Whom (hon). Relative referring to Christ just before 
and accusative case, object of both idontes and agapate (ye 
love). Not having seen (ouk idontes). Second aorist active 
participle of horad, to see, with ouk rather than mé because 
it negatives an actual experience in contrast with mé horantes 
(though not seeing, hypothetical case). On whom (eis hon) 
with pisteuontes common construction for “believing on” 
(pisteud eis). It is possible that Peter here has in mind the 
words of Jesus to Thomas as recorded in John 20:29 (““Happy 
are those not seeing and yet believing”). Peter was present 
and heard the words of Jesus to Thomas, and so he could use 
them before John wrote his Gospel. Ye rejoice greatly 
(agalliate). Same form as in verse 6, only active here instead — 
of middle. With joy (charai). Instrumental case (manner). 
Unspeakable (aneklalétoi). Wate and rare double compound 
verbal (alpha privative and eklaled), here only in N.T., in 
Dioscorides and Heliodorus, “unutterable,” like Paul’s 
“indescribable” (anekdiégétos) gift (II Cor. 9:15, here alone 
in N.T.). Full of glory (dedoxasmenéi). Perfect passive 
participle of doxazé, to glorify, “glorified joy,” like the glori- 
fied face of Moses (Ex. 34:20ff.; II Cor. BGs 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER — 85 


g. Receiving (komizomenoi). Present middle participle of 
komizo, old verb, to receive back, to get what is promised 
(5:4; Heb. 10:36). The end of your faith (to telos tés pistes). 
The conclusion, the culmination of faith (II Cor. 3:13; Rom. 
2:21f.; 10:4). See Heb. 12:2 of Jesus as “‘Pioneer and Per- 
fecter of Faith.” Even the salvation of your souls (soterian 
psuchin). No “even” in the text, just the accusative of 
apposition with feos, viz., final salvation. 

10. Concerning which salvation (peri hés sotérias). Another 
relative clause (taking up sdféria from verse g and incorpo- 
rating it) in this long sentence (verses 3 to 12, inclusive, ali 
connected by relatives). Peter lingers over the word sdtérta 
(salvation) with something new to say each time (Bigg). - 
Here it is the general sense of the gospel of grace. Sought 
(exezétésan). First aorist active indicative of ekzéted, to seek 
out (Acts 15:17), late and rare compound, only in LXX and 
N.T. save once in Aristides. Searched diligently (exérauné- 
san). First aorist active indicative of exeraunad, old and 
common compound (exereunad), to search out diligently, 
here only in N.T. Both of these words occur together in 
I Macc. 9:26. Of the grace that should come unto you (peri tes 
eis humas charitos). “Concerning the for you grace” (meant 
for you). 

11. Searching (eraunontes). Present active participle of 
eraunad, late form for older ereunaéd (both in the papyri), 
uncompounded verb (John 7:52), the compound occurring in 
verse 10 above. What time or what manner of time (eis tina é 
poion kairon). Proper sense of poios (qualitative interroga- 
tive) kept here as in I Cor. 15:35, Rom. 3:27, though it is 
losing its distinctive sense from ¢is (Acts 23 334). The 
prophets knew what they prophesied, but not at what time 
the Messianic prophecies would be fulfilled. The Spirit of 
Christ which was in them (to en autois pneuma Christou). 
Peter definitely asserts here that the Spirit of Jesus Christ 
(the Messiah) was in the Old Testament prophets, the Holy 


86 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Spirit called the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God 
(Rom. 8:9), who spoke to the prophets as he would speak ta 
the apostles (John 16:14). Did point unto (edélou). Imper- 
fect active of délod, to make plain, “did keep on pointing to,” 
though they did not clearly perceive the time. When it testi- 
Jied beforehand (promarturomenon). Present middle par- 
ticiple of promarturomai, a late compound unknown else- 
where save in a writer of the fourteenth century (Theodorus 
Mech.) and now in a papyrus of the eighth. It is neuter 
here because pueuma is neuter, but this grammatical gender 
should not be retained as “it” in English, but should be 
rendered “he” (and so as to Acts 8:15). Here we have pre- 
dictive prophecy concerning the Messiah, though some mod- 
ern critics fail to find predictions of the Messiah in the Old 
Testament. The sufferings of Christ (ta eis Christon pathé- 
mata). “The sufferings for (destined for) Christ” like the 
use of ¢is in verse 10 (¢is humas for you). The glories that 
should follow them (tas meta tauta doxas). ‘“‘The after these 
things (sufferings) glories.” The plural of doxa is rare, but 
occurs in Ex. 15:11; Hos. 9:11. The glories of Christ fol- 
lowed the sufferings as in 4:13; 5:1, 6. 

12. To whom (hois). Dative plural of the relative pro- 
noun. To the prophets who were seeking to understand. 
Bigg observes that “the connexion between study and in. 
spiration is a great mystery.” Surely, but that is no argu- 
ment for ignorance or obscurantism. We do the best that 
we can and only skirt the shore of knowledge, as Newton ~ 
said. It was revealed (apekaluphthé). First aorist passive 
indicative of apokaluptd, old verb, to reveal, to unveil. Here 
is revelation about the revelation already received, revelation 
after research. Did they minister (dikonoun). Imperfect 
active of diakoned, old verb, to minister, ‘“‘ were they minister- 
ing.” Have been announced (anéggelé). Second aorist pass- 
ive indicative of anaggellé, to report, to bring back tidings 
(John 4:25). Through them (dia ton). Intermediate agent 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER = 87 


(dia), “the gospelizers” (ton euaggelisamenon, articular first 
aorist middle participle of ewaggelizd, to preach the gospel). 
By the Holy Ghost (pneumati hagidi). Instrumental case of 
the personal agent, “by the Holy Spirit” (without article). 
Sent forth from heaven (apostalenti). Second aorist passive 
participle of apostel/é in instrumental case agreeing with 
pneumati hagidi (the Spirit of Christ of verse 11). Desire 
(epithumousin). Eagerly desire (present active indicative of 
epithumed, to long for). To look into (parakupsai). First 
aorist active infinitive of parakupto, old compound to peer 
into as in Luke 24:12; John 20:5, 11; James 1:25, which see. 
For the interest of angels in the Incarnation see Luke 2:13f. 

13. Wherefore (dio). ‘Because of which thing,” the glo- ~ 
rious free grace opened for Gentiles and Jews in Christ 
(verses 3-12). Girding up (anazdsamenoi). First aorist 
middle participle of anazdnnumi, late and rare verb (Judges 
18:16; Prov. 29:35; 31:17), here only in N.T., vivid metaphor 
for habit of the Orientals, who quickly gathered up their 
loose robes with a girdle when in a hurry or starting on a 
journey. The loins (tas osphuas). Old word for the part of 
the body where the girdle (zd”@) was worn. Metaphor here 
as in Luke 12:35; Eph. 6:14. Mind (dianoias). Old word 
for the faculty of understanding, of seeing through a thing 
(dia, noed) as in Matt. 22:37. Be sober (néphontes). “‘ Being 
sober” (present active participle of néphd, old verb, but in 
N.T. always as metaphor (I Thess. 5:6, 8, etc., and so in 4:7). 
Perfectly (teleids). Adverb, old word (here alone in N.T.), 
from adjective teleios (perfect), connected with e/pisate (set 
your hope, first aorist active imperative of e/pizd) in the 
Revised Version, but Bigg, Hort, and most modern com- 
mentators take it according to Peter’s usual custom with the 
preceding verb, néphontes (“being perfectly sober,” not 
“hope perfectly”). That is to be brought (ten pheromenén). 
Present passive articular participle of phero, picturing the 


88 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


process, ‘that is being brought.” For “revelation” (apoka- 
lupsei) see end of verse 7. 

14. 4s children of obedience (hos tekna hupakoés). A 
common Hebraism (descriptive genitive frequent in LXX 
and N.T., like huioi tés apeitheias, children of disobedience, 
in Eph. 2:2) suggested by Aupakoén in verse 2, “children 
marked by obedience.” Not fashioning yourselves (mé 
sunschematizomenoi). Usual negative mé with the par- 
ticiple (present direct middle of sunschématizo, a rare (Aris- 
totle, Plutarch) compound (sun, schématizd, from schema 
from echo), in N.T. only here and Rom. 12:2 (the outward 
pattern in contrast with the inward change metamorphod). 
See Phil. 2:6f. for contrast between schéma (pattern) and 
morphé (form). According to your former lusts (tais proteron 
epithumiais). Associative instrumental case after sunsché- 
matizomenoi and the bad sense of epithumia as in 4:2; II Pet. 
1:4; James 1:14f. In the time of your ignorance (en tei agnoiai 
humon). “In your ignorance,” but in attributive position 
before “lusts.” Agnoia (from agnoed, to be ignorant) is old 
word, in N.T. only here, Acts 3:17; 17:30; Eph. 4:18. 

15. But like as he which called you is holy (alla kata ton 
kalesanta humas hagion). ‘This use of kata is a regular Greek 
idiom (here in contrast with sunschématizomenoi). “But 
according to the holy one calling you or who called you” 
(first aorist articular participle of kaled, to call). God is our 
standard or pattern (kata), not our lusts. Be ye yourselves 
also holy (kai autoi hagioi genéthéte). First aorist (ingressive) 
passive imperative of ginomai, to become with allusion (kai 
also) to kata (God as our example), “Do ye also become 
holy.” For anastrophé (manner of life) see verse 18; 2:12; 
3:1-16; James 3:13; II Pet. 2:7. Peter uses anastrophé eight 
times. The original meaning (turning up and down, back 
and forth) suited the Latin word conversatio (converto), but 
not our modern “conversation” (talk, not walk). 

16. Because it is written (dioti gegraptai). ‘‘Because (dioti 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 89 


stronger than hofi below) it stands written” (regular formula 
for O.T. quotation, perfect passive indicative of graph). 
The quotation is from Lev. 11:44; 19:2; 20:7. Reénforced 
by Jesus in Matt. 5:48. The future esesthe here is volitive like 
an imperative. 

17. If ye call (ei epikaleisthe). Condition of first class and 
present middle indicative of epikaleo, to call a name on, to 
name (Acts 10:18). 4s Father (patera). Predicate accusa- 
tive in apposition with ton—krinonta. Without respect of 
persons (aprosopolémptos). Found nowhere else except in 
the later Ep. of Clem. of Rome and Ep. of Barn., from 
alpha privative and prosopolemptes (Acts 10:34. See James 
2:9 for prosdpolempted and 2:1 for prosdpolémpsia) from 
prosdpon lambano (in imitation of the Hebrew). According 
to each man’s work (kata to hekastou ergon). ‘According to 
the deed of each one” God judges (krinonta) just as Christ 
judges also (II Cor. 5:10). Pass (anastraphéte). Second 
aorist passive imperative of anastrephod, metaphorical sense 
as in II Cor. 1:12; 2 Pet. 2:18. The time (ton chronon). 
Accusative case of extent of time. Of your sojourning (tés 
paroikias humon). A late word, found in LXX (Ps. 119:5) 
and in N.T. only here and Acts 13:17 and in ecclesiastical 
writers (one late Christian inscription). It comes from 
paroiked, old verb, to dwell beside (in one’s neighbourhood), 
and so of pilgrims or strangers (paroikos Acts 7:6) as of 
Jews away from Palestine or of Christians here on earth, 
then of a local region (our “‘parish’””). Peter here recurs 
to 1:1 (“‘sojourners of the Dispersion”). In fear (en phobii). 
Emphatic position at beginning of the clause with ana- 
straphéte at the end. . 

18. Knowing (eidotes). Second perfect active participle 
of oida, causal participle. The appeal is to an elementary 
Christian belief (Hort), the holiness and justice of God with 
the added thought of the high cost of redemption (Bigg). 
Ye were redeemed (elutrothete). First aorist passive indica- 


go WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


tive of Jutrod, old verb from /utron (ransom for life as of a 
slave, Matt. 20:28), to set free by payment of ransom, 
abundant examples in the papyri, in N.T. only here, Luke 
24:21; Titus 2:14. The ransom is the blood of Christ. 
Peter here amplifies the language in Is. 52:3f. Not with cor- 
ruptible things (ou phthartois). Instrumental case neuter 
plural of the late verbal adjective from phtheird to destroy 
or to corrupt, and so perishable, in N.T. here, verse 23; 
I Cor. 9:25; 15:53f.; Rom. 1:23. Argurioi é chrusioi (silver 
or gold) are in explanatory apposition with phthartois and 
so in the same case. Slaves were set free by silver and 
gold. From your vain manner of life (ek tés mataias humon 
anastrophés). “Out of” (ek), and so away from, the pre- 
Christian anastrophé of verse 15, which was “vain” (mataias. 
Cf. Eph. 4:17-24). Handed down from your fathers (patro- 
paradotou). This adjective, though predicate in position, is 
really attributive in idea, like cheiropoiétou in Eph, 2:11 
(Robertson, Grammar, p. 777), like the French idiom. This 
double compound verbal adjective (pater, para, didomi), 
though here alone in N.T., occurs in Diodorus, Dion. Halic. 
and in several i ciseaad (Moulton and Milligan’s Vocad- 
ulary; Deissmann, Bible Studies, pp. 266f.). The Jews made 
a wrong use of tradition (Matt. 15:2ff.), but the reference 
here seems mainly to Gentiles (1 Pet. 2:12). 

19. But with precious blood (alla timidi haimati). Instru- 
mental case of haima after elutrothéte (repeated from verse 
18). Peter here applies the old adjective timios (from timé, 
of Christ in I Pet. 2:7) to Christ as in 1:7 polutimoteron to 
testing of faith. The blood of anyone is “precious” (costly), 
far above gold or silver, but that of Jesus immeasurably 
more so. 4s of a lamb (hos amnou). This word occurs in 
Lev. 12:8; Numb. 15:11; Deut. 14:4 of the lamb prescribed 
for the passover sachifice (Ex. 12:5). John the Baptist ap- 
plies it to Jesus (John 1:29, 36). It occurs also in Acts 
8:32 quoted from Is. 53:7f. Undoubtedly both the Baptist 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 1 


and Peter have this passage in mind. Elsewhere in the 
N.T. arnion is used of Christ (Rev. 5:6, 12). Jesus is the 
Paschal Lamb. Peter sees clearly that it was by the blood 
of Christ that we are redeemed from sin. Without blemish 
(amomou). Without (alpha privative) spot (mdmos) as the 
paschal lamb had to be (Lev. 22:21). So Heb. 9:14. With- 
out spot (aspilou). Without (alpha privative) stain (spilos 
spot) as in James 1:27; II Pet. 3:14; I Pet. 6:14. Even the 
blood of Christ (Christou). Genitive case with haimati, but 
in unusual position for emphasis and clearness with the 
participles following. 

20. Who was foreknown indeed (proegnosmenou men). Per-. 
fect passive participle (in genitive singular agreeing with 
Christou) of progindské, old verb, to know beforehand (Rom. 
8:29; Ii Pet. 3:17). See progndsin theou in verse 2. Before 
the foundation of the world (pro katabolés kosmou). This 
precise curious phrase occurs in John 17:24 in the Saviour’s 
mouth of his preincarnate state with the Father as here 
and in Eph. 1:4. We have apo kataboles kosmou in Matt. 
25:34 (kosmou omitted in Matt. 13:35); Luke 11:50; Heb. 
4:33 9:26; Rev. 13:8; 17:8. Katabolé (from kataballo) was 
originally laying the foundation of a house (Heb. 6:1). The 
preincarnate Messiah appears in the counsels of God also 
in I Cor. 2:7; Col. 1:26f.; Eph. r:9f; 3:9-11; Rom. 16:25; 
I Tim. 1:9. But was manifested (phanerothentos de). First 
aorist (ingressive) passive participle of phanerod, referring 
to the Incarnation in contrast with the preéxistence of 
Christ (cf. John 1:31; I John 3:5, 8). 4t the end of the times 
(ep’ eschatou ton chronon). Like ep’ eschatou ton hémeron 
(Heb. 1:2). The plural chronoi, doubtless referring to suc- 
cessive periods in human history until the fullness of the 
time came (Gal. 4:4). For your sake (di? humds). Proof 
of God’s love, not of their desert or worth (Acts 17:30f.; 
Heb. 11:39f.). 

21. Who through him are believers in God (tous di’ autou 


92 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


pistous eis theon). Accusative case in apposition with humas 
(you), ‘“‘the through him (that is Christ as in 1:8 and. Acts 
3:16) believers (pistous correct text of A B) in God.” Which 
raised (ton egeiranta). Accusative singular articular (agree- 
ing with ¢heon) first aorist active participle of egeird (cf. 
di’ anastaseos Iésou in verse 3). Gave glory to him (doxan 
autoi donta). Second aorist active participle of didomi agree- 
ing also with theon. See Peter’s speech in Acts 3:13 about 
God glorifying (edoxasen) Jesus and also the same idea by 
Peter in Acts 2:33-36; 5:31. So that your faith and hope 
might be in God (hoste ten pistin humon kai elpida eis theon). 
Hoste with the infinitive (einai) and the accusative of gen- 
eral reference (pistin kai elpida) is used in the N.T. as in 
the Koiné for either purpose (Matt. 10:1) or usually result 
(Mark 4:37). Hence here result (so that is) is more prob- 
able than design. 

22. Seeing ye have purified (hégnikotes). Perfect active 
participle of hagnizd, old verb from hagnos (pure), here with 
psuchas. (souls), with kardias (hearts) in James 4:8 as in 
I John 3:3 of moral cleansing also. See the ceremonial 
sense of the word as in LXX in John 11:55; Acts 21:24, 26; 
24:18. In your obedience (en téi hupakoéi). With repetition 
of the idea in 1:2, 2:14 (children of obedience). To the 
truth (tés aletheias). Objective genitive with which compare 
John 17:17, 19 about sanctification in the truth and 2 Thess. 
2:12 about believing the truth. There is cleansing power 
in the truth of God in Christ. Unfeigned (anupokriton). 
Late and rare double compound, here alone in Peter, but 
see James 3:17; II Cor. 6:6, etc. No other kind of phila. 
delphia (brotherly love) is worth having (I Thess. 4:9; Heb. 
13:1; II Pet. 1:7). From the heart fervently (ek kardias 
ektenos). Late adverb (in inscriptions, Polybius, LXX). 
The adjective ektenés is more common (I Pet. 4:8). 

23. Having been begotten again (anagegennémenoi). Per- 
fect passive participle of anagennad, which see in verse 2. 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER _ 93 


Not of corruptible seed (ouk ek sporas phthartés). Ablative 
with ek as the source, for phthartos see verse 18, and sporas 
(from speird to sow), old word (sowing, seed) here only in 
N.T., though sporos in Mark 4:26f., etc. For “‘incorrupt- 
ible” (aphthartou) see verse 4, 3:4. Through the word of God 
(dia logou theou). See James 1:18 for “by the word of 
truth,” verse 25 here, and Peter’s use of Jogos in Acts 10:36. 
It is the gospel message. Which liveth and abideth (zontos 
kai menontos). ‘These present active participles (from 240 
and meno) can be taken with ¢heou (God) or with Jogou 
(word). In verse 25 menei is used with réma (word). Still 
in Dan. 6:26 both menon and z6n are used with theos. Either - 
construction makes sense here. 

24f. Quotation from Is. 40:6-8 (partly like the LXX, 
partly like the Hebrew). For (dioti). As in verse 16 (dia 
and oti), ‘“‘for that.” So in 2:6. See a free use of this 
imagery about the life of man as grass and a flower in James 
1:11. The best MSS. here read autés (thereof) after doxa 
(glory) rather than anthropou (of man). Withereth (ex- 
éranthé). First aorist (gnomic, timeless) passive indicative 
of xéraind (see James 1:11). Falleth (exepesen). Second 
aorist (gnomic, timeless) active indicative of ekpiptd (see 
James 1:11). In verse 25 note eis humds (unto you) like 
eis humdas in 1:4 (=humin dative). 


CHAPTER II 


1. Putting away therefore (apothemenoi oun). Second aorist 
middle participle of apotithémi, old and common verb, in 
metaphorical sense either to cleanse defilements (3:21; James 
1:21) or to put off clothing (Rom. 13:12; Col. 3:5ff.; Eph. 
4:22). Either sense suits here. Therefore (oun) because of 
the new birth (1:23) and the new life demanded. Wicked- 
ness (kakian). This old word, from kakos (evil), in the an- 
cients meant vice of any kind and note pasan (all) here. 
Guile (dolon). Old word (from de/é, to catch with bait), 
deceit. Hypocrisies (hupokriseis). Singular (hupokrisin) in 
the best MSS. See 1:22 (anupokriton) and Mark 7:6f. for 
Christ’s denunciation of hypocrites which the disciples did 
not understand, including Peter (Matt. 15:16ff.). Envies 
(phthonous). Genuine here, not phonous (murders), as B 
has it. For the word see Matt. 27:18. Evil speakings 
(katalalias). Late word (from katalalos, defamer, Rom. 1:30), 
in N.T. only here and II Cor. 12:20. “Backbitings.” For 
verb see 2:12. 

2. 4s newborn babes (hos artigennéta brephé). Brephos, 
old word, originally unborn child (Luke 1:41, 44), then in- 
fant (Luke 2:12), here figuratively, like népioi. Artigennéta - 
is a late and rare compound (Lucian, imperial inscription) 
from arti and gennad, with evident allusion to anagegen- 
némenoi in 1:23, probably meaning that they were recent 
converts, possibly slight proof that the Epistle written be- 
fore Romans by Paul (Kuhl). Long Jor (epipothésate). First 
aorist (constative) active imperative of epipothed, old verb 
for intense yearning (Phil. 2:26). The spiritual milk which 
is without guile (to logikon adolon gala). Gala is old word 
for milk as in I Cor. 9:7 and as metaphor in I Cor. 3:2. 

94 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 95 


Adolos is an old compound (here alone in N.T.) adjective 
(alpha privative and do/os deceit), unadulterated milk which, 
alas, is so hard to get. Logikon is an old adjective in -ikos, 
from Jogos (reason, speech), in N.T. only here and Rom. 
12:1, used here with allusion to /ogou (1:23) and réma (1:25), 
“the sincere milk of the word” (“‘the milk belonging to the 
word,” either the milk which is the word or the milk con- 
tained in the word, that is Christ). So Bigg holds. But 
in Rom. 12:1 Paul uses /ogikon in the sense of ‘‘rational” 
or ‘“‘spiritual,” and that idea is possible here as Hort holds. 
In the Pelagia legend (Usener) we have the phrase son 
logikén probaton tou Christou (the spiritual or rational sheep . 
of Christ). That ye may grow thereby (hina en autoi auxé- 
thete). Purpose clause with hina and the first aorist passive 
subjunctive of auxand, old and common verb to grow. See 
this same metaphor in Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:15. Peter uses the 
word of God as the food for growth, especially for babes in 
Christ, not emphasizing the distinction from solid food 
(broma) made in I Cor. 3:2; Heb. 5:13. Salvation (sdtérian) 
here is final salvation. 

3. If ye have tasted (ei egeusasthe). Condition of first class 
with ei and first aorist middle indicative of geué in figurative 
sense as in Heb.6:4f. “‘A taste excites the appetite” (Bengel). 
Gracious (chréstos). Quotation from Ps. 33(34):9. The 
Hebrew for the LXX chréstos is simply tobh (good). Plato 
used the word for food also, and Peter carries out the meta- 
phor in gala (milk) as in Luke 5:39. 

4. Unto whom (pros hon). The Lord, carrying on the 
imagery and language of the Psalm. Coming (prosercho- 
menoi). Present middle participle masculine plural of pro- 
serchomai (proselthate in the Psalm) agreeing with the subject 
of oikodomeisthe. A living stone (lithon zdnta). Accusative 
case in apposition with on (whom, the Lord Christ). There 
is apparent an intentional contradiction between “living” 
and ‘“‘stone.” Cf. “living hope” in 1:3 and “living word” 


96 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


in 1:23. Rejected indeed of men (hupo anthropon men apode- 
dokimasmenon). Perfect passive participle of apodokimazé, 
old verb to repudiate after test (Luke 9:22), in the accusative 
case agreeing with lithon. But with God (para de thedi). “By 
the side of God,” as he looks at it, in contrast with the rejec- 
tion “by men” (hupo anthropon). Elect (eklekton). From 
Is. 28:6 as in entimon (precious, for which see Luke 7:2) 
rather than dokimon (proved) expected after apodedoki- 
masmenon as meaning far more in God’s sight, ‘“‘a pre- 
eminence of position with” (Hort). 

5. Ye also as living stones (kai autoi hos lithoi zontes). 
Peter applies the metaphor about Christ as the living stone 
to the readers, “‘ye yourselves also.” Are built up a spiritual 
house (otkodomeisthe oikos pneumatikos). Present passive 
indicative second person plural of oikodomed, the very verb 
used by Jesus to Peter in Matt. 16:18 (oikodomésd) of build- 
ing his church on the rock. If the metaphor of a house of 
living stones seems “‘violent” (Vincent), it should be remem- 
bered that Jesus employed the figure of a house of believers. 
Peter just carried it a bit farther and Paul uses a temple for 
believers in one place (I Cor. 3:16) and for the kingdom of 
God in general (Eph. 2:22), as does the author of Hebrews 
(3:6). This “spiritual house” includes believers in the five 
Roman provinces of 1:1 and shows clearly how Peter under- 
stood the metaphor of Christ in Matt. 16:18 to be not a local 
church, but the church general (the kingdom of Christ). 
To be a holy priesthood (eis hierateuma hagion). Late word 
(from hierateud, to serve as priest, Luke 1:8 alone in N.T.), in 
LXX (Ex. 19:6), in N.T. only here and verse 9, either the 
office of priest (Hort) or an order or body of priests. At any 
rate, Peter has the same idea of Rev. 1:6 (hiereis, priests) 
that all believers are priests (Heb. 4:16) and can approach 
God directly. To offer up (anenegkai). First aorist active 
infinitive (of purpose here) of anapherd, the usual word for 
offering sacrifices (Heb. 7:27). Only: these are: “spiritual” 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 97 


(pneumatikas) as pictured also in Heb. 13:15f. Acceptable 
(euprosdektous). Late (Plutarch) double compound verbal 
adjective (eu, pros, dechomai) as in II Cor. 6:2. 

6. It is contained (periechei). Present active (here intransi- 
tive, to contain, only N.T. example) of periechd, old verb, to 
surround, transitive in Luke 5:9 to seize (only other N.T. 
example). The formula with periechei is in Josephus (Ant. 
XI. 7). This Scripture (en graphéi) is Is. 28:16 with some 
changes. Peter had in verse 4 already quoted ek/ekton and 
entimon. Now note akrogoniaion (a chief corner stone), a 
word apparently invented by Isaiah (from akros, highest, and 
goniaios, Attic word for corner stone). Paul in Eph. 2:20 _ 
uses the same word, making Christ the chief corner stone 
(the only other N.T. example). In Isaiah the metaphor is 
rather a foundation stone. Peter and Paul make it “‘the 
primary foundation stone at the structure” (W. W. Lloyd). 
On him (ep’autdi). That is, “on it” (this corner stone, that is, 
Christ). Shall not be put to shame (ou mé kataischunthéi). 
Strong negatives ou mé with first aorist passive subjunctive 
of kataischund, old verb, to put to shame (Rom. 5:5). 

7. The preciousness (hé timé). Or “the honour.” Expla- 
nation of entimon and ou mé kataischunthéi and only true 
“for you which believe” (tois pisteuousin ethical dative of 
articular present active participle of pisteud to believe). But 
for such as disbelieve (apistousin de). Dative present active. 
participle again of apisted, opposite of pisteud (Luke 24:11). 
Was made the head of the corner (egenéthé eis kephalén gonias). 
This verse is from Ps..118:22 with evident allusion to Is. 
28:16 (kephalén gonias =akrogoniaion). See Matt. 21:42= 
Mark 12:10=Luke 20:17, where Jesus himself quotes Ps. 
118:22 and applies the rejection of the stone by the builders 
(hoi oikodomountes, the experts) to the Sanhedrin’s conduct 
toward him. Peter quoted it also (and applied it as Jesus 
had done) in his speech at the Beautiful Gate (Acts 4:11). 
Here he quotes it again to the same purpose. 


98 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


8. And (kai). Peter now quotes Is. 8:14 and gives a new 
turn to the previous quotation. To the disbelieving, Christ 
was indeed ‘‘a stone of stumbling (/ithos proskommatos) and 
rock of offence (petra skandalou),” quoted also by Paul in 
Rom. 9:32f., which see for discussion. Proskomma (from 
proskopto, to cut against) is an obstacle against which one 
strikes by accident, while skandalon is a trap set to trip one, 
but both make one fall. Too much distinction need not be 
made between /Jithos (a loose stone in the path) and petra 
(a ledge rising out of the ground). For they (hoi). Causal 
use of the relative pronoun. Stumble at the word, being disobe- 
dient (proskoptousin toi logoi apeithountes). Present active 
indicative of proskopté with dative case, Jogoi, and present 
active participle of apeithed (cf. apistousin in 2:7) as in 3:1. 
Toi logoi can be construed with apeithountes (stumble, being 
disobedient to the word). Whereunto also they were appointed 
(eis ho kai etethésan). First aorist passive indicative of 
tithemi. See this idiom in I Tim. 2:7. ‘‘Their disobedience 
is not ordained, the penalty of their disobedience is” (Bigg). 
They rebelled against God and paid the penalty. 

9. But ye (humeis de). In contrast with the disobedient 
ones. n elect race (genos eklekton). From Is. 43:20. The 
blood relation of the spiritual Israel (not the Jewish race) 
through the new birth (1:23). 4 royal priesthood (basileion 
hierateuma). From Ex. 19:6 (cf. Rev. 1:6; 5:10). The 
official in Christian churches is preshuteros =episcopos, not . 
hiereus. We are all hiereis (priests). Cf.2:5. 4 holy nation 
(ethnos hagion). Also from Ex. 19:6, but here applied, not to 
the national Israel, but to the spiritual Israel of believers 
(both Jews and Gentiles). 4 people for God’s own possession 
(Jaos eis peripoiésin). The idea here occurs in Ex. 19:5; 
Deut. 7:6; 14:2; 26:18, where we have /aos periousios as in 
Titus 2:14 (alone in the N.T.), and in Mal. 3:17 we find 
eis peripoiésin (for a possession). Periousios laos is a people 
over and above the others and peripoiésis is a possession in a 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 99 


special sense (Eph. 1:14). See Paul’s use of periepoiésato in 

Acts 20:28. The old rendering, “a peculiar people,” had this 

idea of possession, for “peculiar” is from pecus (Latin for 

flock). That ye may shew forth (hopos exaggeiléte). Purpose 
clause with Aopés, rather than hina, with the first aorist active 
subjunctive of exaggelld, old verb, to tell out, here alone 
in N.T. The excellencies (tas aretas). From Is. 43:21. Old 
word for any preéminence (moral, intellectual, military), 
often for “‘virtue,” but not in that sense in the O.T. or the 
N.T. The word has the sense of moral worth in II Pet. 

1:3, 5; Phil. 4:8; and the Apocrypha. Jn Isaiah (here quoted) 

it means praise and glory to God. So also Is. 42:12. See. 
Acts 2:11 ta megaleia tou theou (the mighty works of God). 

Darkness (skotous). Heathenism. His marvellous light ‘(to 

thaumaston autou phos). Christianity. For thaumaston (from 

thaumazo) see Matt. 21:42. For the change from heathenism 
to Christianity see Col. 1:12; Eph. 5:8-14. 

10. Which in time past (hoi pote). “‘Who once upon a 
time.” No people (ou laos). This phrase from Hos. 2:23. 
Note use of ou (not oudeis) with Jaos like Hebrew negative. 
Which had not obtained mercy (hoi ouk eleeémenoi). Perfect 
passive articular participle of e/eed and the emphatic negative 
ou, with which compare Paul’s use of Hos. 1 and 2:in Rom. 
9:25, which may have been known to Peter or not. But now 
have obtained mercy (nun de eleéthentes). Change to first 
aorist passive participle from “the long antecedent state” to 
“the single event of conversion which ended it” (Hort). 

11. As sojourners and pilgrims (hos paroikous kai parept- 
demous). This combination from the LXX (Gen. 33:4; 
Ps. 39:13). See 1:1 for parepid@mos and 1:17 for paroikia 
and Eph. 2:19 for paroikos (only there and here in N.T., 
Christians whose fatherland is heaven). To abstain from 
(apechesthai). Present middle (direct) infinitive of apeché, 
old verb, to hold back from (I Thess. 4:3). In indirect com- 
mand (to keep on abstaining from) after parakald (1 beseech). 


100 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


With the ablative case ¢6n sarkikin epithumion, the grosser 
sins of the flesh (for sarkikos see I Cor. 3:3) like the list in 4:3. 
Which (haitines). “‘Which very ones.” Like Latin guippe 
qui. War against the soul (strateuontai kata tes psuchés). 
Present middle indicative of strateud, to carry on a campaign 
(James 4:1). See this struggle between the flesh and the 
spirit vividly pictured by Paul in Gal. 5:16-24. 

12. Seemly (kalén). Predicate adjective with anastrophén, 
for which see 1:15, 18. The Gentiles are on the watch for 
slips in moral conduct by the Christians. That (hina). 
Final conjunction with doxasdsin (they may glorify, first 
aorist active subjunctive of doxazd, the purpose of the Chris- 
tians about the Gentiles. Wherein (en hoi).. “In what 
thing.” 4s evil-doers (hos kakopoion). As they did and do, 
old word (from kakon and poied, John 18:30), in N.T. only 
here and verse 14 in correct text. Heathen talk against us 
(katalalousin) gleefully. By your good works (ek tin kalin 
ergon). ‘“Out of (asa result of) your good (beautiful) deeds.” 
Which they behold (epopteuontes). Present active participle 
of epopteud, old verb (from, epopéés, overseer, spectator, II Pet. 
1:16), to be an overseer, to view carefully, in N.T. only here 
and 3:2. In the day of visitation (en hémerai episkopés). 
From Is. 10:33. Cf. its use in Luke 19:44, which see for 
the word episkopé (from episkoped, to inspect (Heb. 12:15). 
Clear echo here of Matt. 5:16. 

13. Be subject to (hupotagéte). Second aorist passive im- 
perative second person plural of hupotassé, to subject to, as in 
3:22. Every ordinance of man (paséi anthropinéi ktisei). 
Dative case of old and common word kfisis (from ktizd, to 
create, to found), act of creation (Rom. 1:20), a creature or 
creation (Rom. 1:25), all creation (Col. 1:15), an institution 
as here (in Pindar so). For anthropinos (human) see James 
3:7. Peter here approves no special kind of government, but 
he supports law and order as Paul does (Rom. 13:1-8) unless 
it steps in between God and man (Acts 4:20). For the Lord’s 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER . 1o1 


sake (dia ton kurion). For Jesus’ sake. That is reason 
enough for the Christian not to be an anarchist (Matt. 22:21). 
The heathen were keen to charge the Christians with any 
crime after Nero set the fashion. ‘It should not be forgot- 
ten that, in spite of the fine language of the philosophers, the 
really popular religions in Greece and Rome were forms of 
devil-worship, intimately blended with magic in all its 
grades” (Bigg). As supreme (hos huperechonti). Dative 
singular of present active participle of huperechd, old verb 
(intransitive), to stand out above (to have it over), as in 
Rom. 13:1. It is not the divine right of kings, but the fact 
of the king as the outstanding ruler. 

14. Unto governors (hégemosin). Dative again of hégemon, 
aleader (from hégeomai, to lead), oldand common word (Matt. 
10:18). As sent by him (hos di’ autou pempomenois). Present 
passive participle of pempéd. Di’autou is “by God,” as Jesus 
made plain to Pilate; even Pilate received his authority ultt- 
mately “from above” (John 18:11). For vengeance on evil- 
doers (eis ekdikésin kakopoion). Objective genitive with 
ekdikésin, for which see Luke 18:7f. For praise to them that 
do well (epainon agathopoion). Objective genitive again, 
agathopoios, a late word (Plutarch, Sirach) from agathon and 
poied here only in N.T. Found in a magical papyrus. 

15. By well-doing (agathopoiountas). Present active par- 
ticiple of agathopoied, only in LXX and N.T. (Mark 3:4). 
In accusative case agreeing with humds understood, accusa- 
tive of general reference with phimoin, present active infini- 
tive (epexegetic infinitive after to thel@ma tou theou, the will of 
God), late and rare verb (from phimos muzzle), as in Matt. 
22:12. The ignorance of foolish men (tén ton aphronon 
anthropon agnosian). Agnosia is late and rare word (in the 
papyri) from alpha privative and gnosis (knowledge), in 
N.T. only here and I Cor. 15:24 (disgraceful ignorance in 
both instances). Note alliteration. 

16. As free (hos eleutheroi). Note nominative again con- 


102 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


nected with Aupotagéte in verse 13, not with phimoin in 
verse 14 (a parenthesis in fact). For this ethical sense of 
eleutheros see Gal. 4:26. And not using your freedom (kai 
mé echontes tén eleutherian). ‘“‘And not holding your lib- 
erty” (present active participle of echd, with usual negative 
mé with participle. For a cloke of wickedness (hos eptka- 
lumma tes kakias). Epikalumma (from epikaluptd Rom. 4:7) 
is a rare word (Aristotle, LXX) for veil, here only in N.T. 
and in figurative sense for pretext to do wickedness under, 
a thing, alas, that sometimes happens. But as bondservants 
of God (all’ hos theou douloi). Paul’s proud title. There is 
no such thing as absolute freedom (personal freedom), for 
that is anarchy. Cf. Rom. 6:22 “enslaved to God.” 

17. Honour all men (pantas timésate). Not with the same 
honour. Constative use of the aorist imperative. Love the 
brotherhood (tén adelphoteta agapate). Present active impera- 
tive of agapad, keep on doing it. Note the abstract adel- 
photés (from adelphos, brother) in the collective sense, rare 
save in ecclesiastical literature, though in I Macc. 12:10; 
IV Macc. 10:3, and in late papyri. It is a word fer all 
Christians. Fear God (ton theon phobeisthe). In both senses 
of reverence and dread, and keep it up (present middle im- 
perative). Honour the king (ton basilea timate). Keep that 
up also. A fine motto in this verse. 

18. Servants (hoi oiketai). Note article with the class as 
with andres (3:7), though not with gunaikes (3:1). Ozketés, 
old word from oikos (house), means one in the same house 
with another (Latin domesticus), particularly house servants 
(slaves) in distinction from the general term doulos (slave). 
“Ye domestics.” See similar directions to Christian serv- 
ants (slaves) in Col. 3:22-25; Eph. 6:5-7; I Tim. 6:1f.; 
Titus 2:9f. Oiketés in N.T. occurs only here, Luke 16:13; 
Acts 10:7; Rom. 14:4. Be in subjection (hupotassomenot). 
Present middle participle of Aupotassd. common late com- 
pound to subject oneself to one (Luke 2:51). Either the 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 103 


participle is here used as an imperative (so in 3:1, 7) as in 
Rom. 12:16f., or the imperative este has to be supplied 
(Robertson, Grammar, p. 945). To your masters (tois des- 
potais). Dative case of despotés, old word for absolute owner 
in contrast with doulos. It is used also of God (Luke 2:29; 
Acts 4:24, 29) and of Christ (II Pet. 2:1; Jude 4). Kurios 
has a wider meaning and not necessarily suggesting absolute 
power. To the good and gentle (tois agathois kai epietkesin). 
Dative case also with the article with class. For epieikés 
see on James 3:17. There were slave-owners (masters) like 
this as there are housekeepers and employers of workmen 
today. This is no argument for slavery, but only a side- - 
light on a condition bad enough at its best. To the froward 
(tois skoliois). ‘‘To the crooked.” Old word, also in Luke 
3:5; Acts 2:40; Phil. 2:15. Unfortunately there were slave- 
holders as there are employers today, like this group. The 
test of obedience comes precisely toward this group. 

19. For this is acceptable (touto gar charis). “For this 
thing (neuter singular fouto, obedience to crooked masters) 
is grace” (charis is feminine, here “thanks” as in Rom. 
7:25). “‘Acceptable” calls for euprosdekton (2:5), which is 
not the text here. Jf a man endureth griefs (ei huopheret 
tis lupas). Condition of first class with ez and present ac- 
tive indicative of hupopherd, old verb, to bear up under, in 
N.T. only here, I Cor. 10:13; II Tim. 3:11. Note plural 
of lupé (grief). For conscience toward God (dia sunetdésin 
theou). Suffering is not a blessing in and of itself, but, if 
one’s duty to God is involved (Acts 4:20), then one can 
meet it with gladness of heart. Theou (God) is objective 
genitive. For suneidésis (conscience) see on Acts 23:1; I 
Cor. 8:7. It occurs again in I Pet. 3:16. Suffering wrong- 
fully (paschin adikos). Present active participle of paschd 
and the common adverb adikés, unjustly, here alone in N.T, 
This is the whole point, meade clear already by Jesus in 


1o4 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Matt. 5:10-12, where Jesus has also “falsely” (pseudo- 
menoi). See also Luke 6:32-34. 

20. For what glory (poion gar kleos). Qualitative inter- 
rogative (what kind of glory). ‘‘What price glory?” Kleos 
is old word from k/eo (kaled, to call), report, praise, glory, 
here only in N.T. Jf ye shall take it patiently (ei hupome- 
neite). First-class condition with ei and future active in- 
dicative of hupomeno, for which see James 1:12. Same 
condition also in next sentence (a/l’ ei, etc.). When ye sin 
(hamartanontes). Present active participle of hamartané (con- 
tinued repetition). And are buffeted for it (kai kolaphizo- 
menoi). Present passive participle of kolaphizd, late word 
(from kolaphos fist), only in N.T. (cf. Matt. 26:67) and 
ecclesiastical writers. Repeated action again. No posing 
as a martyr allowed here. Christians do sometimes deserve 
persecution, as Jesus implied (Matt. 5:10-12). When ye do 
well (agathopoiountes). Present active participle of agatho- 
poied as in verse 15. And suffer for it (kai paschontes). 
Present active participle of paschd (verse 19). No “for it” 
in the Greek here or in the previous sentence. This is ac- 
ceptable with God (touto charis para theoi). ‘‘This thing 
(neuter) is thanks (verse 19) by the side of (para) God (as 
God looks at it).” 

21. For hereunto were ye called (eis touto gar eklethéte). 
First aorist indicative of kaled, to call. They were called to 
suffer without flinching (Hort), if need be. Because (hoti). . 
The fact that Christ suffered (epathen) lifts their suffering 
to a new plane. Leaving you an example (humin hupolimp- 
anon hupogrammon). Present active participle of the late 
Ionic verb hupolimpané (in the papyri) for the common 
hupoleipo, to leave behind (under), here only in N.T. Hupo- 
grammos is also a late and rare word (from hupographd, to 
write under), a writing-copy for one to imitate, in II Macc. 
2:28; Philo, Clement of Rome, here only in N.T. Clement 
of Alex. (Strom. V. 8. 49) uses it of the copy-head at the 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER | 105 


top of a child’s exercise book for the child to imitate, in- 
cluding all the letters of the alphabet. The papyri give 
many examples of Aupographé and hupographo in the sense 
of copying a letter. That ye should follow his steps (hina 
epakolouthéséte tois ichnesin autou). Purpose clause with 
hina and first aorist active subjunctive of epakolouthed, old 
verb, to follow closely upon, with the associative-instru- 
mental (I Tim. 5:10, 24) or the locative here. Jchnos is 
old word (from iké, to go), tracks, footprints, in N.T. only 
here, II Cor. 12:18; Rom. 4:12. Peter does not mean that 
Christ suffered only as an example (1:18), but he did leave 
us his example for our copying (I John 2:6). 

22. Who did no sin (hos hamartian ouk epoiésen). Quota- 
tion from Is. 53:9. He has already expressed the sinlessness 
of Christ in 1:19. The next clause is a combination of Is. 
3:9 and Zeph. 3:13. For “guile” (dolos) see verse 1. Was 
found (heurethé). First aorist passive indicative of heurisko. 
Christ’s guilelessness stood the test of scrutiny (Vincent), 
as Peter knew (Matt. 26:60; John 18:38; 19:4, 6). 

23. When he was reviled (loidoroumenos). Present passive 
participle of Joidored, old verb (from Joidoros, reviler, I Cor. 
§:11) as in John 9:28. Reviled not again (ouk anteloidoret). 
Imperfect active (for repeated incidents) of antiloidored, late 
and rare compound (Plutarch, Lucian, one papyrus example 
with compound following the simplex verb as here, Moulton 
and Milligan’s Vocabulary), here only in N.T. Idiomatic 
use of anti (in turn, return, back). Threatened not (ouk 
épeilei). Imperfect again (repeated acts) of apeiled, old 
compound (from apeilé, threat, Acts 9:1), in N.T. only here 
and Acts 4:17. But committed himself (paredidou de). Im- 
perfect active again (kept on committing himself) of para- 
didomi, to hand over, usually of one to a judge, but here 
not of another (as the Sanhedrin), but himself (supply 
heauton), for Jesus uses this very idea in Luke 23:46 as he 
dies. Jesus thus handed himself and his cause over to the 


1066 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Father who judges righteously (tai krinonti dikaios, dative 
of present active articular participle of krind). 

24. Who his own self (hos autos). Intensive pronoun with 
the relative referring to Christ (note relatives also in verses 
22 and 23). Bare our sins (anénegken tas hamartias hémon). 
Second aorist active indicative of anapherd, common verb 
of bringing sacrifice to the altar. Combination here of Is. 
53:12 and Deut. 21:23. Jesus is the perfect sin offering 
(Heb. 9:28). For Christ’s body (sdma) as the offering see 
I Cor. 11:24. ‘“‘Here St. Peter puts the Cross in the place 
of the altar” (Bigg). Upon the tree (epi to xulon). Not tree 
here as in Luke 23:31, originally just wood (I Cor. 3:12), 
then something made of wood, as a gibbet or cross. So 
used by Peter for the Cross in Acts 5:30; 10:39; and by 
Paul in Gal. 3:13 (quoting Deut. 21:23). Having died unto 
sins (tais hamartiais apogenomenoi). Second aorist middle 
participle of apoginomai, old compound to get away from, 
with dative (as here) to die to anything, here only in N.T. 
That we might live unto righteousness (hina téi dikaiosungi 
zésomen). Purpose clause with Aina and the first aorist ac- 
tive subjunctive of zad with the dative (cf. Rom. 6:20). 
Peter’s idea here is like that of Paul in Rom. 6:1-23, espe- 
cially verses 2, 10f.). By whose stripes ye were healed (hou 
tot molopi iathéte). From Is. 53:5. First aorist passive in- 
dicative of iaomai, common verb to heal (James 5:16) and 
the instrumental case of m@/éps, rare word (Aristotle, Plu- . 
tarch) for bruise or bloody wound, here only in N.T. Cf. 
1:18. Writing to slaves who may have received such stripes, 
Peter’s word is effective. 

25. For ye were going astray like sheep (ée gar hos probata 
planomenoi). Brought from Is. 53:6, but changed to peri- 
phrastic imperfect indicative with ée and present middle 
participle of planaéd, to wander away. Recall the words of 
Jesus in Luke 15:4-7. But are now returned (alla epestraph- 
éte). Second aorist passive indicative of epistrephd, old verb, 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 107 


to turn, to return (Matt. 10:13). Unto the Shepherd and 
Bishop of your souls (epi ton poimena kai episkopon ton 
psuchon humon). Jesus called himself the Good Shepherd 
(John to:11, and see also Heb. 13:20). Here alone is Christ 
called our “Bishop” (overseer). See both ideas combined 
in Ezek. 34:11. Philo calls God Episcopos. Jesus is also 
Apostolos Heb. 3:1) and he-deserves all other titles of dig- 
nity that we can give him. 


CHAPTER III 


1. In like manner (homoios). Adverb closely connected 
with hupotassomenoi, for which see 2:18. Ye wives (gunatkes). 
Without article. About wives see also Col. 3:18; Eph. 5:22; 
Titus 2:4. To your own husbands (tois idiois andrasin). 
Idiois occurs also in Ephesians and Titus, but not in Colos- 
sians. It strengthens the idea of possession in the article 
tois. Wives are not enjoined to be in subjection to the hus- 
bands of other women, as some think it fine to be (affinities!) 
Even if any obey not the word (kai ei tines apetthousin toi 
logoi). Condition of first class and dative case of Jogos (1:23, 
25; 2:8), that is, remain heathen. That they be gained (hina 
kerdéthésontai). Purpose clause with Aina and first future 
passive indicative of kerdaind, old verb, to gain (from kerdos, 
gain, interest) as in Matt. 18:15. See the future with Aina 
also in Luke 20:10; Rev. 3:9. Without the word (aneu logou). 
Probably here “word from their wives” (Hart), the other 
sense of Jogos (talk, not technical “‘word of God”). By 
the behaviour of their wives (dia tés ton gunaikon anastrophés). 
Won by pious living, not by nagging. Many a wife has had 
this blessed victory of grace. 

2. Beholding (epopteusantes). First aorist active participle — 
of epopteud, for which see 2:12. See 2:12 also for anastrophén 
(manner of life). Chaste (hagnén). Pure because ‘in fear” 
(en phobdi), no word in the Greek for “‘coupled,” fear of 
God, though in Eph. 5:33 fear (reverence for) of the husband 
is urged. 

3. Whose adorning (hon kosmos). Genitive plural of the 
relative referring to gunaikon (wives). Kosmos has here its 
old meaning of ornament (cf. our cosmetics), not the com- 


mon one of world (John 17:5) considered as an orderly 
108 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER | 10g 


whole. Mundus in Latin is used in this double sense (orna- 
ment, world). Let it de (estd). Imperative third singular of 
etmt. Not the outward adorning of plaiting the hair (ouch ho 
exdthen emplokes trichon). ‘The use of ouch here rather than 
mé (usual negative with the imperative) because of the sharp 
contrast in verse 4 (a//’). The old adverb exdthen (from 
without) is in the attributive position like an adjective. 
Emploké is a late word (from empleké, to inweave, II. Tim. 
2:4; II Pet. 2:20) in Strabo, but often in the papyri for 
struggle as well as plaiting, here only in N.T. Of wearing 
(peritheseos). Late and rare word (Galen, Arrian) from 
peritithemi (Matt. 27:28), to put around, a placing around. 
Ornaments of gold were worn round the hair as nets and | 
round the finger, arm, or ankle. Or of putting on (enduseds). 
Old word from endud (to put on), here only in N.T. Peter is 
not forbidding the wearing of clothes and ornaments by 
women, but the display of finery by contrast. Cf. I Tim. 
2:9-13 and Is. 3:16ff. 

4. But the hidden man of the heart (all’ho kruptos tés kardias 
anthropos). Here anthropos is in contrast with kosmos just 
before. See Paul’s use of anthropos for the outer and old, 
the inner and new man (II Cor. 4:16; Rom. 7:22; Col. 3:9; 
Eph. 3:16; 4:22, 24). See also the Jew en kruptoi (Rom. 
2:29) and what Jesus said about God seeing “‘in secret” 
(Matt. 6:4, 6). In the incorruptible apparel of a meek and 
quiet spirit (en tot aphthartoi tou hésuchiou kai praeos pneu- 
matos). No word in the Greek for ‘“‘apparel” (kosmdi). For 
aphthartos see 1:4, 23. For praus see Matt. 5:5; 11:29. 
Pneuma (spirit) is here disposition or temper (Bigg), unlike 
any other use in the N.T. In 3:18, 19; 4:6 it means the 
whole inner man as opposed to sarx or sdma, very much as 
psuché is used as opposed to sdma. Which (ho). Spirit just 
mentioned. Of great price (poluteles). Old word (from polu 
and fe/os, cost), in N.T. only here, Mark 14:3; I Tim. 2:9. 

5. Adorned themselves (ekosmoun heautas). Imperfect active 


110 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


of customary action, “‘used to adorn themselves.” Kosme6 is 
old verb from kosmos in the sense in verse 3. See Heb. 
11:11, 36 for like tribute to holy women of the O.T. The 
participle hupotassomenai repeats verse I. 

6. As Sarah (hos Sarra). Obeyed Abraham (hupékouen tot 
Abraam). Imperfect active of hupakoud, “used to obey” 
(with dative). Calling him lord (kurion auton kalousa). 
Present active participle of kaled. See Gen. 18:12. Whose 
children ye now are (hes egenéthete tekna). First aorist passive 
indicative of ginomai, “whose children ye became.” Tf ye do 
well (agathopoiousai). Present active feminine plural par- 
ticiple of agathopoied (2:15), “doing good.” And are not put 
in fear by any terror (kai mé phoboumenai médemian ptoésin). 
Free quotation from Prov. 3:25, “and not fearing any terror” 
(cognate accusative of pfoésis, after phoboumenai, present 
middle participle, late and rare word from p/oed, to terrify, as 
in Luke 21:9, here only in N.T.). Perhaps Peter regards 
Sarah’s falsehood as the yielding to a sudden terror (Hart). 
Hannah could also be named along with Sarah. The women 
somehow do not organize “daughters of Sarah” societies. 

4. Ye husbands likewise (hoi andres homoios). Probably 
“likewise” here refers to honouring all men (2:17), not “like- 
wise” of 3:1. Dwell with (sunoikountes). Present active par- 
ticiple of sunoiked, old verb for domestic association, here 
only in N.T. Used as imperative here like the participle in 
2:18; 3:1. According to knowledge (kata gnosin). ‘‘With.an 
intelligent recognition of the nature of the marriage relation” — 
(Vincent). Giving honour unto the woman as unto the weaker ves- 
sel (hos asthenester0i skeuei toi gunaikeioi aponemontes timén). 
Present active participle of aponemd, old verb, to assign, to 
portion out (or off), here only in N.T. Skeuos is an old 
and common word for vessel, furniture, utensil (Matt. 12:29; 
II Tim. 2:20). Here both husband and wife are termed 
vessels or ‘“‘parts of the furniture of God’s house”’ (Bigg). 
See Paul’s use of skeuos for ministers (II Cor. 4:7). Gunai- 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 111 


keidi here is an adjective (female, feminine) from guné 
(woman, wife). She is termed “‘the weaker” (sai astheneste- 
rot), not for intellectual or moral weakness, but purely for 
physical reasons, which the husband must recognize with 
due consideration for marital happiness. Yoint-heirs of the 
grace of life (sunkléronomoi charitos zo@s). Late double com- 
pound found in an Ephesian inscription and the papyri, in 
N.T. only here, Rom. 8:17; Eph. 3:6; Heb. 11:9. God’s 
gift of life eternal belongs to woman as well as to man. In 
the eyes of God the wife may be superior to the husband, not 
merely equal. To the end that your prayers be not hindered 
(cis to mé egkoptesthai tas proseuchas humon). Purpose clause 
with eis to and the present passive infinitive (with negative 
mé) of egkopto, to cut in, to interrupt, late verb (Polybius), as 
in Rom. 15:22, etc. Very vivid to us now with our tele- 
phones and radios when people cut in on us. Proseuchas 
(prayers) is the accusative of general reference. Husbands 
surely have here cause to consider why their prayers are not 
answered. 

8. Finally (to telos). Adverbial accusative. Conclusion, 
not of the Epistle, but only of the addresses to various 
classes. No verb (este imperative, be) here. Likeminded 
(homophrones). Old compound (homos, phrén), here only in 
N.T. Compassionate (sumpatheis). Old adjective (sun, 
pascho), in N.T. only here and Rom. 12:15. Our “‘sympa- 
thetic” in original sense. Loving as brethren (philadelphoi). 
Old compound (philos, adelphos), here only in N.T. Tender- 
hearted (eusplagchnoi). Late and rare compound (eu and 
splagchnon), in Hippocrates, Apocrypha, in N.T. only here 
and Eph. 4:32. Humble minded (tapeinophrones). Late com- 
pound (¢apeinos, phrén), in Plutarch, Prov. 29:23, here only 
in N.T. 

g. Not rendering evil for evil (mé apodidontes kakon anti 
kakou). Mé and the present active participle of apodidomi, 
to give back. The same phrase in Rom. 12:17 and the same 


112 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


idea in I Thess. 5:15. Peter may have obtained it from Paul 
or both from Prov. 17:13; 20:22, “‘an approximation to 
Christ’s repeal of the /ex talionis (Matt. §:38ff.) which Plato 
first opposed among the Greeks” (Hart). Common use of 
anti for exchange. Reviling for reviling (loidorian anti 
loidorias). Allusion to 2:23 (Christ’s own example). But 
contrariwise blessing (tounantion de eulogountes). Adverbial 
accusative and crasis (to enantion) of the neuter article and 
the adjective enantios (en, antios, opposite, Matt. 14:24), “on 
the contrary.” For eulogountes (present active participle of 
euloged) see Luke 6:28; Rom. 12:14 (imperative eulogeite). 
For hereunto were ye called (hoti eis touto eklethéte). See 2:21 
for this verb and use of eis touto (pointing to the preceding 
argument). That ye should inherit a blessing (hina eulogian 
kléronoméséte). Purpose clause with hina and the first aorist 
active subjunctive of k/éronomed, a plain reference to Esau, 
who wanted ‘“‘to inherit the blessing” (Heb. 12:17) after he 
had sold his birthright. Christians are the new Israel (both 
Gentiles and Jews) and are the spiritual descendants of 
Isaac (Gal. 4:22ff.). 

10. For (gar). Reason for the entire exhortation in verses 
8 and g and introducing in verses 10 to 12 a quotation from 
Ps. 34:13-17 with some slight changes. Would love life 
(thelon zoén agapain). ‘Wishing to love life.” This present 
life. The LXX expressions are obscure Hebraisms. The 
LXX has agapon (participle present active of agapad, not the - 
infinitive agapain. Let him refrain (pausato). Third person 
singular first aorist active imperative of paud to make stop, 
whereas the LXX has pauson (second person singular). 
His tongue (tén glossan). See James 3:1-12. That they 
speak no guile (tou mé lalésai dolon). Purpose clause with 
genitive article tou (negative mé) and the first aorist active 
infinitive of /aled. But it can also be explained as the 
ablative case with the redundant negative mé after a verb of 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 113 


hindering (pausaté) like Luke 4:42. See Robertson, Gram- 
mar,p.1061. “Let him refrain his lips from speaking guile.” 

11. Let him turn away (ekklinato). First aorist active im- 
perative third person singular of ekk/ind, where the LXX has 
ekklinon (second person singular). Old verb, in N.T. only 
here, Rom. 3:12; 16:17. Peter adapted the passage all 
through to his own construction and use. So as to poiésaté 
(let him do) for poiéson (do thou), zéésaté (let him seek) for 
zeteson (do thou seek), didxaté (let him pursue) for didxon (do 
thou pursue), all first aorist active imperatives (of poied, 
zéted, diok0). See Heb. 12:14 for “pursuing peace.” If men 
only did! 

12. Upon (epi). In the case of righteous (dikaious, in the — 
O.T. sense like dikaion Lot in II Pet. 2:7) for their good, but 
in the case of men “that do evil” (epi poiountas kaka, “upon 
men doing evil things”) “the face of the Lord” (prosdpon 
kuriou) is not for their good, epi here approaching “against” 
in idea. 

13. That will harm you (ho kakosin humas). Future active 
articular participle of kakod, old verb (from kakos, bad) as in 
Acts 7:6, 1g. Any real hurt, either that wishes to harm you 
or that can harm. See the words in Is. 50:9. If ye be (ean 
genésthe). Rather, “if ye become” (condition of third class 
with ean and second aorist middle subjunctive of ginomai). 
Zealous of that which is good (tou agathou zélotai). ‘Zealots 
for the good” (objective genitive after zé/dtai (zealots, not 
zealous), old word from zé/od (I Cor. 12:12). 

14. But and if ye should suffer (all’ ei kai paschoite). “But 
if ye should also (or even) suffer.” Condition of the fourth 
class with ei and the optative (undetermined with less likeli- 
hood), a rare condition in the vernacular Koiné, since the 
optative was a dying mode. If matters, in spite of the 
prophetic note of victory in verse 13, should come to actual 
suffering “‘for righteousness’ sake” (dia dikaiosunén) as in 
Matt. 5:10 (heneken, not dia), then “blessed” (makarioi, the 


114 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


very word of Jesus there which see, a word meaning “happy,” 
not eulogétoi) “are ye” (not in the Greek). If the con- 
clusion were expressed regularly, it would be eiéte an (ye 
would be), not este (ye are). It is interesting to note the 
third-class condition in verse 13 just before the fourth-class 
one in verse 14. Fear not their fear (ton phobon auton mé 
phobéthéte). Prohibition with mé and the first aorist (in- 
gressive) passive subjunctive of phobeomai, to fear, and the 
cognate accusative phobon (fear, terror). “Do not fear 
their threats” (Bigg). Quotation from Is. 8:12f. Neither be 
troubled (méde taraxthéte). Prohibition with méde and the 
first aorist (ingressive) subjunctive of ¢arassd, to disturb 
(Matt. 2:6; John 12:27). Part of the same quotation. 
Cf. 3:6. 

15. Sanctify (hagiasate). First aorist active imperative of 
hagiazd. This instead of being afraid. Christ as Lord 
(kurion ton Christon). Ton Christon, direct object with 
article and kurion predicate accusative (without article). 
This is the correct text, not ton theon of the Textus Receptus. 
An adaptation to Christ of Is. 8:13. Being ready always 
(hetoimoi aei). No participle in the Greek, old adjective 
(Tit. 3:1). To give answer (pros apologian). “‘For an apol- 
ogy,” the old sense of apologia, an answer back, a defence 
(not excuse), as in Acts 22:1, from apologeomai to defend 
(not to apologize). 4 reason concerning the hope that ts tn 
you (logon peri tés en humin elpidos). Original sense of logon 
(accusative of the thing with aitounti with humds, accusative © 
of the person) “concerning the in you hope.” Ready with 
a spoken defence of the inward hope. This attitude calls for 
an intelligent grasp of the hope and skill in presenting it. In 
Athens every citizen was expected to be able to join in the 
discussion of state affairs. Yet with meekness and fear (alla 
meta prautétos kai phobou). Of God (2:18; 3:2, 4), not of man. 

16. Having a good conscience (suneidésin echontes agathén). 
Present active participle of ech. See 2:18 for suneidésin 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 115 


and 3:21 for suneidésis agathé again (‘‘a quasi-personifica- 
tion,” Hart). That they may be put to shame (hina katai- 
schunthosin). Purpose clause with hina and the first aorist 
passive subjunctive of kataischund, old verb, to put to shame 
(Luke 13:17; I Pet. 2:6). Wherein ye are spoken against (en 
hoi katalaleisthe). Present passive indicative of katalaled, 
for which see 2:12 with en hoi also. Peter may be recalling 
(Hart) his own experience at Pentecost when the Jews first 
scoffed and others were cut to the heart (Acts 2:13, 37). 
Who revile (hoi epéreazontes). Articular present active par- 
ticiple of epéreazd, old verb (from epéreia, spiteful abuse), 
to insult, in N.T. only here and Luke 6:28. In Christ (en 
Christoi). Paul’s common mystical phrase that Peter has 
three times (here, 5:10, 14), not in John, though the idea is 
constantly in John. Peter here gives a new turn (cf. 2:12) 
to anastrophé (manner of life). “Constantly the apostle 
repeats his phrases with new significance and in a new light” 
(Bigg). 

17. Better (kreitton). Comparative of kratus as in II Pet. 
2:21; Heb. 1:4. Patient endurance not only silences cal- 
umny (verse 16), is Christlike (verse 18), but it has a value 
of its own (verse 17). Jf the will of God should so will (ei 
theloi to theléma tou theou). Condition of the fourth class 
again (ei—theloi) with ei and the optative. For a like 
pleonasm see John 7:17. For well-doing than for evtl-doing 
(agathopoiountas & kakopoiountas). Accusative plural agree- 
ing with Aumas understood (accusative of general reference 
with the infinitive paschein (to suffer) of the participles from 
agathopoied (see 2:15) and kakopoied (Mark 3:4, and see 
I Pet. 2:14 for kakopoios). 

18. Because Christ also died (hoti kai Christos apethanen). 
So the best MSS.; later ones epathen (suffered). The exam- 
ple of Christ should stir us to patient endurance. For sins 
(peri hamartion). “‘ Concerning sins” (not his, but ours, 
1:18). Peri (around, concerning) with hamartias in the 


116 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


regular phrase for the sin offering (Lev. 5:7; 6:30), though 
huper hamartias does occur (Ezek. 43:25). So in the N.T. 
we find both peri hamartion (Heb. 5:3) and huper hamartion 
(Heb. 5:1). Once (hapax). Once for all (Heb. 9:28), not 
once upon a time (pote). The righteous for the unrighteous 
(dikaios huper adikon). Literally, “just for unjust” (no 
articles). See I Pet. 2:19 for the sinlessness of Christ as 
the one perfect offering for sin. This is what gives Christ’s 
blood value. He has no sin himself. Some men today fail 
to perceive this point. That he might bring us to God (hina 
hémas prosagagéi toi thedi). Purpose clause with hina, with 
second aorist active subjunctive of prosagd and the dative 
case toi thedi. The MSS. vary between hémas (us) and 
humas (you). The verb prosagd means to lead or bring to 
(Matt. 18:24), to approach God (cf. prosagdgén in Eph. 
2:18), to present us to God on the basis of his atoning death 
for us, which has opened the way (Rom. 3:25; Heb. 10:1of.) 
Being put to death in the flesh (thanatotheis men sarki). First 
aorist passive participle of thanatod, old verb (from thanatos 
death), to put to death. Sarki is locative case of sarx. But 
quickened in the spirit (zdopoiétheis de pneumati). First aorist 
passive participle of zdopoied rare (Aristotle) verb (from 
z0opoios making alive), to make alive. The participles are 
not antecedent to apethanen, but simultaneous with it. There 
is no such construction as the participle of subsequent ac- 
tion. The spirit of Christ did not die when his flesh did, . 
but “was endued with new and greater powers of life” 
(Thayer). See I Cor. 15:22 for the use of the verb for the 
resurrection of the body. But the use of the word pneumati 
(locative case) in contrast with sarki starts Peter’s mind off 
in a long comparison by way of illustration that runs from 
verses Ig to 22. The following verses have caused more 
controversy than anything in the Epistle. 

19. In which also (en hoi kai). That is, in spirit (relative 
referring to pneumati. But, a number of modern scholars 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 117 


have followed Griesbach’s conjecture that the original text 
was either Nde kai (Noah also), or Endch kai (Enoch also), 
or en hoi kai Enoch (in which Enoch also) which an early 
scribe misunderstood or omitted Endch kai in copying (hom- 
oioteleuton). It is allowed in Stier and Theile’s Po/yglott. 
It is advocated by J. Cramer in 1891, by J. Rendel Harris 
in The Expositor (1901), and Sidelights on N.T. Research 
(p. 208), by Nestle in 1902, by Moffatt’s New Translation 
of the New Testament. Windisch rejects it as inconsistent 
with the context. There is no manuscript for the conjec- 
ture, though it would relieve the difficulty greatly. Luther 
admits that he does not know what Peter means. Bigg has 
no doubt that the event recorded took place between Christ’s 
death and his resurrection and holds that Peter is alluding 
to Christ’s Descensus ad Inferos in Acts 2:27 (with which 
he compares Matt. 27:52f.; Luke 23:34; Eph. 4:9). With 
this Windisch agrees. But Wohlenberg holds that Peter 
means that Christ in his preéxistent state preached to those 
who rejected the preaching of Noah who are now in prison. 
Augustine held that Christ was in Noah when he preached. 
Bigg argues strongly that Christ during the time between 
his death and resurrection preached to those who once heard 
Noah (but are now in prison) and offered them another 
chance and not mere condemnation. If so, why did Jesus 
confine his preaching to this one group? So the theories 
run on about this passage. One can only say that it is a 
slim hope for those who neglect or reject Christ in this life 
to gamble with a possible second chance after death which 
rests on very precarious exegesis of a most difficult passage 
in Peter’s Epistle. Accepting the text as we have, what can 
we make of it? He went and preached (poreutheis ekéruxen). 
First aorist passive (deponent) participle of poreuomai and 
first aorist active indicative of kérussd, the verb commonly 
used of the preaching of Jesus. Naturally the words mean 
personal action by Christ “in spirit” as illustration of his 


118 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


“quickening” (verse 18) whether done before his death or 
afterwards. It is interesting to observe that, just as the 
relative en hoi here tells something suggested by the word 
pneumati (in spirit) just before, so in verse 21 the relative 
ho (which) tells another illustration of the words di’ hudatos 
(by water) just before. Peter jumps from the flood in Noah’s 
time to baptism in Peter’s time, just as he jumped back- 
wards from Christ’s time to Noah’s time. He easily goes 
off at a word. What does he mean here by the story that 
illustrates Christ’s quickening in spirit? Unto the spirits in 
prison (tois en phulakéi pneumasin). The language is plain 
enough except that it does not make it clear whether Jesus 
did the preaching to spirits in prison at the time or to people 
whose spirits are now in prison, the point of doubt already 
discussed. The metaphorical use of en phulakéi can be illus- 
trated by II Pet. 2:4; Jude 6; Rev. 20:7 (the final abode of 
the lost). See Heb. 12:23 for the use of pueumata for dis- 
embodied spirits. 

20. Which aforetime were disobedient (apeithésasin pote). 
First aorist active participle of apeithed (for which verb see 
3:20) in the dative plural agreeing with pueumasin. These 
spirits now in prison once upon a time (pote) were disobe- 
dient (typical rebels, Hart calls them). Waited (apexede- 
cheto). Imperfect middle of the double compound apek- 
dechomai, late verb, probably first by Paul (I Cor. 1:7), 
though in the aprocryphal Acta Pauli (iii) and other late . 
writings cited by Nageli (p. 43). Perfective use of the two 
prepositions (apo, ek) to wait out to the end, as for Christ’s 
Second Coming (Phil. 3:20). A hundred years apparently 
after the warning (Gen. 5:32; 6:3; 7:6) Noah was prepar- 
ing the ark and Noah as a preacher of righteousness (II Pet. 
2:5) forewarned the people, who disregarded it. While the. 
ark was a preparing (kataskeuazomenés kibdtou). Genitive 
absolute with present passive participle of kataskeuazd, old 
compound (Matt. 11:10), for kibdtos (ark) see on Matt. 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 119 


24:38. Wherein (eis hén). “Into which” (the ark). That 
is (tout estin). Explanatory expression like our English 
idiom (Rom. 10:6, etc.). Souls (psuchai). Persons of both 
sexes (living men) as in Acts 2:41; 27:37, etc. Were saved 
(diesdthésan). First aorist passive indicative of dias6zd, old 
compound, to bring safe through as in Acts 27:44. Through 
water (di? hudatos). “By means of water” as the inter- 
mediate agent, an apparent change in the use of dia in 
composition just before (local use) to the instrumental use 
here. They came through the water in the ark and so were 
saved by the water in spite of the flood around them. Peter 
lays stress (Hart) on the water rather than on the ark (Heb. - 
11:7) for the sake of the following illustration. 

21. Which also (ho kai). Water just mentioned. After a 
true likeness (antitupon). Water in baptism now as an anti- 
type of Noah’s deliverance by water. For daptisma see on 
Matt. 3:7. For antitupon see on Heb. 9:24 (only other N.T. 
example) where the word is used of the earthly tabernacle 
corresponding (antitupa) to the heavenly, which is the pat- 
tern (tupon Heb. 8:5) for the earthly. So here baptism is 
presented as corresponding to (prefigured by) the deliver- 
ance of Noah’s family by water. It is only a vague parallel, 
but not over-fanciful. Doth now save you (humas nun s0zei). 
Simplex verb (s6z0, not the compound diasézd). The sav- 
ing by baptism which Peter here mentions is only symbolic 
(a metaphor or picture as in Rom. 6:2-6), not actual as 
Peter hastens to explain. Not the putting away of the filth 
of the flesh (ou sarkos apothesis rupou). Apothesis is old 
word from apotithemi (2:1), in N.T. only here and II Pet. 
1:14. Rupou (genitive of rupos) is old word (cf. ruparos, 
filthy, in James 2:2; Rev. 22:11), here only in N.T. (cf. Is. 
3:33 4:4). Baptism, Peter explains, does not wash away the 
filth of the flesh either in a literal sense, as a bath for the 
body, or in a metaphorical sense of the filth of the soul. 
No ceremonies really affect the conscience (Heb. 9:13f.). 


1200 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Peter here expressly denies baptismal remission of sin. But 
the interrogation of a good conscience toward God (alla sunei- 
déseds agathés eperotema eis theon). Old word from eperotad 
(to question as in Mark 9:32; Matt. 16:1), here only in 
N.T. In ancient Greek it never means answer, but only 
inquiry. The inscriptions of the age of the Antonines use 
it of the Senate’s approval after inquiry. That may be the 
sense here, that is, avowal of consecration to God after 
inquiry, having repented and turned to God and now making 
this public proclamation of that fact by means of baptism 
(the symbol of the previous inward change of heart). Thus 
taken, it matters little whether eis theon (toward God) be 
taken with eperdtéma or suneidéseds. Through the resurrec- 
tion of Fesus Christ (di? anastaseds Iésou Christou). For 
baptism is a symbolic picture of the resurrection of Christ 
as well as of our own spiritual renewal (Rom. 6:2-6). See 
1:3 for regeneration made possible by the resurrection of 
Jesus. 

22. Having gone (poreutheis). First aorist (deponent) par- 
ticiple (not periphrastic) of poreuomai. Being made subject 
(hupotagenton). Second aorist passive participle of hupo- 
tassO (see 2:18; 3:1) in the genitive absolute construction. 
Unto him (autoi). Christ. See I Cor. 15:28. 


CHAPTER IV 


1. For as much then as Christ suffered in the flesh (Christou 
oun pathontos sarki). Genitive absolute with second aorist 
active participle of paschd, to suffer, and the locative case 
of sarx (fresh). The oun (then, therefore) draws and applies 
the main lesson of 3:18-22, the fact that Christ suffered 
for us. drm ye yourselves also (kai humeis hoplisasthe). 
Direct middle first aorist imperative of hoplizd, old verb - 
from hoplon (weapon, John 18:3), in metaphorical sense, 
here only in N.T. With the same mind (ten auteén ennoian). 
Accusative of the thing (content), exnoian, old word (from 
en, nous), putting in mind, thinking, will, in N.T. only here 
and Heb. 4:12. “Here again Christus Patiens is our hupo- 
grammos” (Bigg). For (hoti). Reason for the exhortation. 
Hath ceased from sin (pepautai hamartias). Perfect middle 
indicative of paud to make cease and the ablative singular 
hamartias, but B reads the dative plural hamartiais (cf. 
Rom. 6:1f.). Temptation has lost its appeal and power 
with such a man. 

2. That ye no longer should live (eis to méketi bidsai). Pur- 
pose clause with es fo (negative mé) and the first aorist (for 
the Attic second aorist Jidnai) active infinitive of Ji00, old 
verb, to spend a life (from dios, course of life, Luke 8:14), 
here only in N.T. The rest of your time in the flesh (ton 
epiloipon en sarki chronon). Accusative of time (chronon, 
period of time). Epiloipon is old adjective (epi, loipos, re- 
maining in addition), here only in N.T. But eis to here can 
be result (so that) as in Rom. 1:20; 4:18. 

3. Past (pareléluthos). Perfect active participle of the 
compound verb parerchomai, old verb, to go by (beside) as in 
Matt. 14:15 with ora (hour). May suffice (arketos). No 


121 


122 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


copula in the Greek, probably estin (is) rather than dunatai 
(can). Late and rare verbal adjective from arked, to suffice, 
in the papyri several times, in N.T. only here and Matt. 
6:34; 10:25, apparently referring to Christ’s words in Matt. 
6:34 (possibly an axiom or proverb). To have wrought 
(kateirgasthai). Perfect middle infinitive of katergazomai, 
common compound (kata, ergon work) asin I Cor. 5:3. The 
desire (to bouléma). Correct text, not theléma. Either 
means the thing desired, willed. Jews sometimes fell 
in with the ways of Gentiles (Rom. 2:21-24; 3:9-18; 
Eph. 2:1-3) as today some Christians copy the ways of the 
world. And to have walked (peporeumenous). Perfect mid- 
dle participle of poreuomai in the accusative plural of general 
reference with the infinitive kateirgasthai. Literally, ‘“‘hav- 
ing walked or gone.” In lasciviousness (en aselgeiais). All 
these sins are in the locative case with en. ‘“‘In unbridled 
lustful excesses” (II Pet. 2:7; II Cor. 12:21). Lusts (epithu- 
miais). Cf. 2:11; 4:2. Winebibbings (oinophlugiais). Old 
compound (010s, wine, phlud, to bubble up), for drunken- 
ness, here only in N.T. (also in Deut. 21:20). Revellings 
(komois). Old word (from keimai, to lie down), rioting 
drinking parties, in N.T. here and Gal. 5:21; Rom. 13:13. 
Carousings (potois). Old word for drinking carousal (from 
pind, to drink), here only in the N.T. In the light of these 
words it seems strange to find modern Christians justifying 
their “personal liberty” to drink and carouse, to say nothing | 
of the prohibition law. The Greeks actually carried lust and 
drunkenness into their religious observances (Aphrodite, for 
instance). Abominable idolatries (athemitois eiddlolatriais). 
To the Christian all “idolatry,” (eidolon, latreia), worship of 
idols, is “abominable,” not allowed (alpha privative and 
themitos, themistos the old form, verbal of themizd, to make 
lawful), but particularly those associated with drinking and 
licentiousness. The only other N.T. example of athemitos is 
by Peter also (Acts 10:28) and about the Mosaic law. That 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 123 


may be the idea here, for Jews often fell into idolatrous prac- 
tices (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p- 274). 

4. Wherein (en hoi). “In which thing” (manner of life). 
They think it strange (xenizontai). Present passive indicative 
of xenizd, old verb (from xenos, stranger), to entertain a 
guest (Acts 10:23), to’ astonish (Acts 17:20). See also 4:12. 
“They are surprised or astonished.” That ye run not with 
them (mé suntrechonton humon). Genitive absolute (nega- 
tive mé) with present active participle of suntrechd, old com- 
pound, to run together like a crowd or a mob as here (just 
like our phrase, “running with certain folks”). Into the 
same excess of riot (eis tén autén tés asodtias anachusin). — 
Anachusin (from anached to pour forth) is a late and rare 
word, our overflowing, here only in N.T. Asdtias is the 
character of an abandoned man (asétos, cf. asotds in Luke 
15:13), old word for a dissolute life, in N.T. only here, 
Eph. 5:18; Titus 1:6. Speaking evil of you (blasphémountes). 
Present active participle of dlasphémed as in Luke 22:65. 
“The Christians were compelled to stand aloof from all the 
social pleasures of the world, and the Gentiles bitterly 
resented their puritanism, regarding them as the enemies of 
all joy, and therefore of the human race”’ (Bigg). 

5. Who shall give account (hoi apodosousin logon). Future 
active indicative of apodidimi. For this use with logon 
(account) see Matt. 12:36; Luke 16:2; Acts 19:40; Heb. 
13:17. For the sudden use of the relative hoi see Rom. 3:8. 
To him that is ready to judge (toi hetoimés krinonti). Dative, 
“to the one readily judging,” correct text, not hetoimds 
echonti krinai, “‘to the one ready to judge,” which “‘softens 
the rugged original” (Hart). That is Christ apparently 
(1:13; II Cor. 5:10), but the Father in 1:17. The quick and 
the dead (zontas kai nekrous). “Living and dead.” Those 
living at the time and those already dead (I Thess. 4:15). 

6. Was the gospel preached (euéggelisthé). First aorist 
passive indicative of euaggelizo. Impersonal use. Even to 


124 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


the dead (kai nekrois). Does Peter here mean preached to 
men after they are dead or to men once alive but dead now or 
when the judgment comes? There are those (Augustine, 
Luther, etc.) who take “dead” here in the spiritual sense 
(dead in trespasses and sins as in Col. 2:13; Eph. 2:1), but 
consider it “‘impossible” for Peter to use the same word in 
two senses so close together; but Jesus did it in the same 
sentence, as in the case of psuché (life) in Matt. 16:25. Bigg 
takes it to mean that all men who did not hear the gospel 
message in this life will hear it in the next before the final 
judgment. That they might be judged (hina krithosin men). 
Purpose clause with Aina and the first aorist passive sub- 
junctive of krind, to judge, whereas zdsin de (by contrast) is 
the present active subjunctive of 2ad, to live. There is con- 
trast also between kata anthropous (according to men) and 
kata theon (according to God). 

7. But the end of all things is at hand (panton de to telos 
éggiken). Perfect active indicative of eggiz0, to draw near, 
common late verb (from eggus), same form used by the 
Baptist of the Messiah’s arrival (Matt. 3:2) and by James 
in 5:8 (of the second coming). How near Peter does not say, 
but he urges readiness (1:5f.; 4:6) as Jesus did (Mark 14:38) 
and Paul (I Thess. 5:6), though it is drawing nearer all the 
time (Rom. 12:11), but not at once (II Thess. 2:2). Be 
ye therefore of sound mind (sophronésate oun). In view of 
the coming of Christ. First aorist (ingressive) active im- 
perative of sdphroned (sds, sound, phrén, mind) as in Mark 
5:15. Be sober unto prayer (népsate eis proseuchas). First 
aorist (ingressive of néphd (see 1:13) and plural proseuchas, 
(prayers). Cf. Eph. 6:18. 

8. Above all things (pro panton). See this phrase in James 
5:12. Being fervent (ektené echontes). Present active -par- 
ticiple of echontes and predicate accusative of adjective 
ektenés (from ekteind, to stretch out), stretched out, here 
only in N.T., “holding intent you love among yourselves.” 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 125 


For love covereth a multitude of sins (hoti agapé kaluptei plethos 
hamartion). See James 5:20 for meaning, sins of the one 
loved, not of the one loving. 

9. Using hospitality (philoxenoi). ‘Friendly to strangers,” 
old word (from philos, xenos), in N.T. only here and I Tim. 
3:2; Titus 1:8. No-verb here in the Greek. Without mur- 
muring (aneu goggusmou). Like choris goggusmon in Phil. 
2:14. Complaint spoils hospitality. Jesus enjoined the 
entertainment of strangers (Matt. 25:35). Inns were rare 
and very poor. Hospitality made mission work possible 
(III John 5). . 

10. Gift (charisma). Late N.T. word (in late papyri) from 
charizomai, to give graciously. It is used here by Peter as 
one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit (I Cor. 12:4, 9, 29-31; Rom. 
12:6). Ministering (diakonountes). Present active par- 
ticiple plural of diakoned, common verb (Matt. 20:28), 
though hekastos (each) is singular. As good stewards (his 
kaloi oikonomoi). For “‘steward” (oitkonomos, house-man- 
ager) see Luke 16:1 and I Cor. 4:1 (used by Paul of himself) 
and of any bishop (Titus 1:7), but here of any Christian. 
See kalos used with diakonos in I Tim. 4:6. Of the manifold 
grace of God (poikilés charitos theou). For poikilos (many- 
colored) see on 1:6 and James 1:2. 

11. If any man speaketh (ei tis lalei). Condition of first 
class, assumed. as a fact. Speaking as it were oracles of God 
(hos logia theou). No predicate in this conclusion of the 
condition. For /ogia theou see Acts 7:38 (Mosaic law); 
Rom. 3:2 (the Old Testament); Heb. 5:12 (the substance of 
Christian teaching), here of the utterances of God through 
Christian teachers. Logion (old word) is a diminutive of 
logos (speech, word). It can be construed here as nomina- 
tive or as accusative. The verb has to be supplied. Jf any 
one ministereth (ei tis diakonei). First-class condition again. 
See Acts 6:2-4 for the twofold division of service involved 
here. Which God supplieth (hes choregei ho theos). Ablative 


1246 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


case (Aés) of the relative attracted from the accusative hén, 
object of chorégei (present active indicative of choréged, old 
verb, to supply from chorégos, chorus leader, in N.T. only 
here and II Cor. 9:10). Peter has the compound epichorégeo 
in II Pet. 1:5, 11. God is the supplier of strength. That 
God may be glorified (hina doxazétai ho theos). Purpose 
clause with hina and the present passive subjunctive of 
doxazd. See John 15:8. Whose is (hoi estin). “To whom 
(dative) is,” that is to Jesus Christ the immediate ante- 
cedent, but in Rom. 16:27 and Jude 25 the doxology is to 
God through Christ. For other doxologies see I Pet. 5:11; 
II Pet. 3:18; Gal. 1:5; Rom. 9:5; 11:36; Phil. 4:20; Eph. 3:21; 
LTimiia:ty 96216; Tim) 4S pdlebwag215 Revieasepipsiigs 
7:12, The others addressed to Christ are II Pet. 3:18; 
II Tim. 4:18; Rev. 1:6. 

12. Think it not strange (mé xenizesthe). Prohibition with 
mé and the present passive imperative of xenizd, for which 
verb see 4:4. “Be not amazed.” Concerning the fiery trial 
among you (tei en humin purosei). Instrumental case, “by 
the among you burning,” metaphorical sense of old word 
(since Aristotle), from purod, to burn (pur fire). See 1:7 for 
the metaphor. See Rev. 18:9, 18 only other N.T. examples. 
It occurs in Prov. 27:21 for the smelting of gold and silver 
and so in Ps. 56:10 (LXX 65:10): ‘‘Thou didst smelt us as 
silver is smelted” (epurdsas hémas hos puroutai to argurion). 
Which cometh upon you (humin ginomenéi). Present middle 
participle of ginomai (already coming) with dative case © 
humin. To prove you (pros peirasmon). ‘‘For testing.” As 
though a strange thing happened unto you (hos xenou humin 
sumbainontos). Genitive absolute with Ads, giving the al- 
leged reason, and humin, dative case with sumbainontos 
(present active participle of sumbaind, to go together, to 
happen (Mark 10:32), agreeing with xezou (strange, Heb. 
13:9). 

13. Inasmuch (katho). “In so far forth as” (‘‘according 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 127 


to which thing”), old conjunction, in N.T. only here and 
II Cor. 8:12; Rom. 8:26. Ye are partakers of (koinéneite). 
Present active indicative of koindned, old verb (from koind- 
nos, partner), to share in either with genitive (Heb. 2:14) 
or dative as here (pathémasin). That ye may rejoice with 
exceeding joy (hina charéte agallidmenoi). Purpose clause 
with hina and second aorist passive subjunctive of chaird, 
with the present middle participle of agalliaéd to exult (1:8), 
“that ye may rejoice exulting.” See 1:6 to 8 for this same 
idea associated with the second coming of Christ as here. 
14. If ye are reproached (ei oneidizesthe). Condition of 
first class assumed as true with ef and present passive indica- 
tive of oneidizd, for which verb see James 1:5. For the name 
of Christ (en onomati Christou). ‘‘In the matter of the name 
of Christ.” For the idea see Matt. 5:11f.; 19:29; Acts 5:41; 
9:16; 21:13. This is the only N.T. example of just onoma 
Christou, here used because of the use of Christianos in 
verse 16. For the beatitude makarioi see Matt. 5:11f. The 
Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God (to tes doxés kai to tou 
theou pneuma). Note repetition of the article (to) though 
pneuma only once. The reference is to the Holy Spirit, who 
is the Spirit of Glory and of God. Resteth upon you (eph’ 
hémas anapauetai). Quotation from Is. 11:2. Present 
middle indicative of anapaud, to give rest, refresh (Matt. 
11:28). “He rests upon the Christian as the Shechinah 
rested upon the tabernacle” (Bigg). Cf. 1:8; Matt. 3:16. 
15. Let no one of you suffer (mé tis humon pascheto). Pro- 
hibition with mé and present active imperative (habit pro- 
hibited). 4s (Ads). Charged as and being so. Two specific 
crimes (murderer, thief) and one general phrase (kakopoios, 
evildoer, I Pet. 2:12, 14), and one unusual term allotriepts- 
copos (a meddler in other men’s matters). Note @ Ads (or as) 
=or “also only as” (Wohlenberg). The word was appar- 
ently coined by Peter (occurring elsewhere only in Dionys. 
Areop. and late eccles. writers) from adlotrios (belonging to 


128 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


another, II Cor. 10:15) and episkopos, overseer, inspector, 
I Pet. 2:25). The idea is apparently one who spies out the 
affairs of other men. Deissmann (Bible Studies, p. 224) gives 
a second-century papyrus with allotrion epithumétés a specu- 
lator alienorum. Epictetus has a like idea (iii. 22.97). Biggs 
takes it to refer to “‘things forbidden.” Clement of Alex- 
andria tells of a disciple of the Apostle John who became a 
bandit chief. Ramsay (Church in the Roman Empire, pp. 
293, 348) thinks the word refers to breaking up family rela- 
tionships. Hart refers us to the gadders-about in I Thess. 
4:11; II Thess. 3:11 and women as gossipers in I Thess. 5:13. 
It is interesting to note also that episkopos here is the word 
for “‘bishop” and so suggests also preachers meddling in the 
work of other preachers. 

16. But if as a Christian (ei de hos Christianos). Supply 
the verb paschei (condition of first class, “if one suffer as a 
Christian”). This word occurs only three times in the N.T. 
(Acts 11:26; 26:28; I Pet. 4:16). It is word of Latin forma- 
tion coined to distinguish followers of Christ from Jews and 
Gentiles (Acts 11:26). Each instance bears that idea. It is 
not the usual term at first like mathétai (disciples), saints 
(hagioi), believers (pisteuontes), etc. The Jews used Nazo- 
raioi (Nazarenes) as a nickname for Christians (Acts 24:5). 
By a.p. 64 the name Christian was in common use in Rome 
(Tacitus, dun. XV. 44). Owing to itacism it was sometimes 
spelled Chréstianoi (i, ei and @ pronounced alike). Let him 
not be ashamed (mé aischunesthd). Prohibition with mé and © 
present passive imperative of aischund. Peter had once been 
ashamed to suffer reproach or even a sneer for being a dis- 
ciple of Christ (Mark 14:68). See the words of Jesus in 
Mark 8:38 and Paul’s in II Tim. 1:12. Peter is not ashamed 
now. In this name (en toi onomati toutoi). Of Christian as 
in Mark 9:41, “because ye are Christ’s.” 

17. For the time is come (hoti ho kairos). No predicate, 
probably estin (is) to be supplied. The phrase that follows 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 129 


comes from the vision of Ezekiel (chapter 9). The construc- 
tion is unusual with fou arxasthai (genitive articular aorist 
middle infinitive of archd), not exactly purpose or result, and 
almost in apposition (epexegetic), but note fou elthein used 
as subject in Luke 17:1. The persecution on hand (1:7) was 
a foretaste of more to come. By “house of God” he can 
mean the same. as the “spiritual house” of 2:5 or a local 
church. Biggs even takes it to refer to the family. And if 
it begin first at us (ei de proton aphhémon). Condition of 
first class again, with the verb archetai understood. “From 
us” (aph’hémon) more exactly. End (telos). Final fate. Of 
them that obey not the gospel of God (ton apeithounton toi tou 
theou euaggelidi). ‘“Of those disobeying the gospel of God.’” 
See the same idea in Rom. 2:8. See Mark 1:14 for believing 
in the gospel. 

18. And if the righteous is scarcely saved (kai ei ho dikaios 
molis sozetat). First-class condition again with e7 and present 
passive indicative of s0z0. Quotation from Prov. 11:31. See 
3:12, 14 and Matt. 5:20. But the Christian is not saved by 
his own righteousness (Phil. 3:9; Rev. 7:14). For molis see 
Acts 14:18 and for asebés (ungodly, without reverence) see 
Rom. 4:5; II Pet. 2:5. Will appear (phaneitai). Future 
middle of phaind, to show. For the question see Mark 
10:24-26. 

19. Wherefore (hoste). Picking up the thread of consola- 
tion again (Bigg). Commit their souls (paratithesthosan tas 
psuchas). Present (continuous) middle imperative third 
plural of paratithémi, old word, a banking figure, to deposit, 
as in I. Tim. 1:18; II Tim. 2:2, the word used by Jesus as 
he died (Luke 23:46). In well-doing (en agathopoiiai). Late 
and rare word, only here in N.T., from agathopoied (I Pet. 
Ding P20)é 


CHAPTER V 


1. Who am a fellow-elder (ho sunpresbuteros). Earliest use 
of this compound in an inscription of B.c. 120 for fellow- 
elders (alderman) in a town, here only in N.T.,-in eccles. 
writers. For the word presbuteros in the technical sense of 
officers in a Christian church (like elder in the local syna- 
gogues of the Jews) see Acts 11:30; 20:17. It is noteworthy 
that here Peter the Apostle (1:1) calls himself an elder along 
with (sum) the other “elders.” 4 witness (martus). This is 
what Jesus had said they must be (Acts 1:8) and what Peter 
claimed to be (Acts 3:15; 10:39). So Paul was to be a 
martus (Acts 22:15). Who am also a partaker (ho kai koino- 
nos). ‘“The partner also,” “the partaker also.” See Luke 
5:10; II Cor. 1:7; II Pet. 1:4. See same idea in Rom. 8:17. 
In Gal. 3:23 and Rom. 8:18 we have almost this about the 
glory about to be revealed to us where mellé as here is used 
with the infinitive. 

2. Tend (poimanate). First aorist active imperative of 
poimaind, old verb, from poimén (shepherd) as in Luke 17:7. 
Jesus used this very word to Peter in the interview by the 
Sea of Galilee (John 21:16) and Peter doubtless has this fact 
in mind here. Paul used the word to the elders at Miletus 
(Acts 20:28). See 2:25 for the metaphor. Flock (poimnion). 
Old word, likewise from poimén, contraction of poimenion 
(Luke 12:32). Exercising the oversight (episkopountes). Pres- 
ent active participle of episkoped, old word (in Heb. 12:15 
alone in N.T.), omitted here by Aleph B. Not by constraint 
(mé anagkastos). Negative mé because of the imperative. 
Old adverb from verbal adjective anagkastos, here alone in 
N.T. But willingly (alla hekousios). By contrast. Old ad- 
verb, in N.T. only here and Heb. 10:26. Nor yet for filthy 


130 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 131 


lucre (méde aischrokerdds). A compound adverb not found 
elsewhere, but the old adjective aischrokerdés is in I Tim. 
3:8; Titus 1:7. See also Titus 1:11 “for the sake of filthy 
lucre” (aischrou kerdous charin). Clearly the elders received 
stipends, else there could be no such temptation. But of a 
ready mind (alla prothumos). Old adverb from prothumos 
(Matt. 26:41), here only in N.T. 

3- Lording it over (katakurieuontes). Present active par- 
ticiple of katakurieud, late compound (kata, kurios) as in 
Matt. 20:25. The charge allotted to you (ton kléron). ‘‘The 
charges,” “the lots” or “the allotments.” See it in Acts 
1:17, 25 in this sense. The old word meant a die (Matt. 
27:25), a portion (Col. 1:12; I Pet. 1:4), here the charges © 
assigned (cf. Acts 17:4). From the adjective k/érikos come 
our cleric, clerical, clerk. Wycliff translated it here “neither 
as having lordship in the clergie.” Making yourselves en- 
samples (tupoi ginomenoi). Present active participle of gino- 
mai and predicate nominative tupoi (types, models) for 
which phrase see I Thess. 1:7. Continually becoming. See 
2:21 for hupogrammos (writing-copy). To the flock (tou poi- 
mniou). Objective genitive. 

4. When the chief Shepherd shall be manifested (phanero- 
thentos tou archipoimenos). Genitive absolute with first 
aorist passive participle of phanerod, to manifest, and geni- 
tive of archipoimén, a compound (archi, poimén) after anal- 
ogy of archiereus, here only in N.T., but in Testam. of Twelve 
Patrs. (Jud. #8) and on a piece of wood around an Egyptian 
mummy and also on a papyrus A.D. 338 (Deissmann, Light, 
etc., p. 100). See Heb. 13:20 for ho poiméen ho megas (the 
Shepherd the great). Ye shall receive (komieisthe). Future 
of komizo (1:9, which see). The crown of glory that fadeth 
not away (ton amarantinon tés doxés stephanon). For “‘crown”’ 
(stephanos) see James 1:12; I Cor. 9:25; Il Tim. 4:8; Rev. 
2:10; 3:10; 4:4. In the Gospels it is used only of the crown 
of thorns, but Jesus is crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 


132 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


2:9). In all these passages it is the crown of victory as it is 
here. See 1:4 for amarantos, unfading. Amarantinos is made 
from that word as the name of a flower amaranth (so called 
because it never withers and revives if moistened with water 
and so used as a symbol of immortality), “composed of ama- 
ranth” or “‘amarantine,” ‘“‘the amarantine (unfading) crown 
of glory.” 

5. Be subject (hopotagéte). Second aorist passive impera- 
tive of hupotasso. Unto the elder (presbuterois). Dative case. 
Here the antithesis between younger and elder shows that 
the word refers to age, not to office as in 5:1. See a like 
change in meaning in I Tim. 5:1,17. // (pantes). All ages, 
sexes, classes. Gird yourselves with humility (tén tapeino- 
phrosunén egkombosasthe). First aorist middle imperative 
of egkomboomai, \ate and rare verb (in Apollodorus, fourth 
cent. B.c.), here only in N.T., from en and koméos (knot, like 
the knot of a girdle). Egkomboma was the white scarf or 
apron of slaves. It is quite probable that Peter here is 
thinking of what Jesus did (John 13:4ff.) when he girded 
himself with a towel and taught the disciples, Peter in par- 
ticular (John 13:9ff.), the lesson of humility (John 13:15). 
Peter had at last learned the lesson (John 21:15-19). The 
proud (huperéphanois). Dative plural of huperéphanos (James 
4:6; Rom. 1:30) after antitassetai (present middle indicative 
of antitasso as in James 4:6 (quoted there as here from Prov. 


6. Humble yourselves therefore (tapeinothéte oun). First © 
aorist passive imperative of tapeinod, old verb, for which 
see Matt. 18:4. Peter is here in the réle of a preacher of 
humility. ‘Be humbled.” Under the mighty hand of God 
(hupo tén krataian cheira tou theou). Common O.T. picture 
(Ex. 3:19; 20:33, etc.). That he may exalt you (hina hupsosé). 
Purpose clause with Aina and first aorist active subjunctive 
of hupsod. Cf. Luke 14:11; Phil. 2:9. In due time (en kairéi). 
Same phrase in Matt. 24:45. 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 133 


7. Casting (epiripsantes). First aorist active participle of 
epiripto, old verb, to throw upon, in N.T. only here and 
Luke 19:35 (casting their clothes on the colt), here from 
Ps. 54 (55):23. For merimna see Matt. 6:25, 31, 34. He 
careth (autoi melei). Impersonal verb melei (present active 
indicative) with dative aufdi, ‘“‘it is a care to him.” God 
does care (Luke 21:18). 

8. Be watchful (grégorésate). First aorist active impera- 
tive of grégored, late present imperative from perfect egrégora 
(to be awake) from egeird (to arouse), as in Matt. 24:42. 
For népsate see 1:13; 4:7. Your adversary (ho antidikos 
humon). Old word for opponent in a lawsuit (Matt. 5:25). 
The devil (diabolos). Slanderer. See on Matt. 4:1. As ao 
roaring lion (hos Oruomenos leon). But Jesus is also pictured 
as the Lion of the tribe of Judah (Rev. 5:5). But Satan 
roars at the saints. Present middle participle druomai, old 
verb, here only in N.T., to howl like a wolf, dog, or lion, of 
men to sing loud (Pindar). See Ps. 21 (22):14. Whom he 
may devour (katapiein). Second aorist active infinitive of 
katapind, to drink down. B does not have ¢ina, Aleph has 
tina (somebody), “‘to devour some one,” while A has inter- 
rogative tina, “whom he may devour” (very rare idiom). 
But the devil’s purpose is the ruin of men. He is a “‘peri- 
patetic” (peripatei) like the peripatetic philosophers who 
walked as they talked. Satan wants all of us and sifts us 
all (Luke 22:31). 

9. Whom withstand (hoi antistéte). Imperative second 
aorist active (intransitive) of anthistémi; same form in James 
4:7, which see. Dative case of relative (A0i). For the im- 
perative in a subordinate clause see verse 12, II Thess. 3:10; 
II Tim. 4:15; Heb. 13:7. Cowardice never wins against the 
devil (II Tim. 1:7), but only courage. Steadfast in your faith 
(stereoi t@i pistei). Locative case pistei. Stereos is old ad- 
jective for solid like a foundacion (II Tim. 2:19). The same 
sufferings (ta auta ton pathématon). An unusual construc-

tion with the genitive rather than the usual ta auta pathé- 
mata, perhaps as Hofmann suggests, ‘‘the same tax of suffer- 
ings” (“the same things in sufferings”). Probably this is 
correct and is like Xenophon’s phrase in the Memorabilia 
(IV. 8. 8), ta tou géeros epiteleisthai (to pay the tax of old 
age). re accomplished (epiteleisthai). Present (and so 
process) middle (you are paying) or passive (is paid) infini- 
tive of epiteled, old verb, to accomplish (II Cor. 7:1). In 
your brethren who are in the world (tei en toi kosmoi humon 
adelphotéti). Associate-instrumental case adelphotéti (in N.T. 
only here and 2:17, which see) after ta auta (like I Cor. 11:5) 
or dative after epiteleisthai. Even so eidotes (second perfect 
active participle of oidz) with an infinitive usually means 
“knowing how to” (object infinitive) as in Luke 12:56; Phil. 
3:18 rather than “knowing that” (indirect assertion) as 
taken above. 

10. The God of all grace (ho theos tés charitos). See 4:10 
for poikilés charitos theou (of the variegated grace of God). 
In Christ (en Christoi). A Pauline phrase (II Cor. 5:17-19), 
but Petrine also. For God’s “‘calling” us (kalesas) see I 
Thess. 5:23f.; I Cor. 1:8f.; Rom. 8:29f. After that ye have 
suffered a little while (oligon pathontas). Second aorist active 
participle of paschd, antecedent to the principal verbs which 
are future active (katartisei, to mend, Mark 1:19; Gal. 6:1, 
sterixei, for which see Luke 9:51 and 22:32, sthendsei from 
sthenos and so far a hapax legomenon like enischud according - 
to Hesychius). For oligon see 1:6. 

11. To him (autoi). To God (dative case). Note kratos 
in the doxology as in I Tim. 6:16 and briefer than the 
doxology in I Pet. 4:11, to Christ. 

12. By Silvanus (dia Silouanou). Probably this post- 
script (12 to 14) is in Peter’s own handwriting, as Paul did 
(II Thess. 3:17f.; Gal. 6:11-18). If so, Silvanus (Silas) 
was the amanuensis and the bearer of the Epistle. 4s J

account him (hos logizomai). Peter uses Paul’s phrase (I 
Cor. 4:1; Rom. 8:18) in giving approval to Paul’s former 
companion (Acts 15:40). J have written (egrapsa). Epis- 
tolary aorist applying to this Epistle as in I Cor. 5:11 (not 
5:9); 9:15; Gal. 6:11; Rom. 15:15; Philemon 19, 21. Briefly 
(di’ oligon). ‘‘By few words,” as Peter looked at it, cer- 
tainly not a long letter in fact. Cf. Heb. 13:22. Testifying 
(epimarturon). Present active participle of epimartured, to 
bear witness to, old compound, here alone in N.T., though 
the double compound sunepimartured in Heb. 2:4. That this 
is the true grace of God (tautén einai aléthé charin tou theou). 
Infinitive einai in indirect assertion and accusative of gen- 
eral reference (tautén) and predicate accusative charin. Peter — 
includes the whole of the Epistle by God’s grace (1:10) and 
obedience to the truth (John 1:17; Gal. 2:5; Col. 1:6). 
Stand ye fast therein (eis hén stéte). “In which (grace) take 
your stand” (ingressive aorist active imperative of histemi). 

13. She that is in Babylon, elect together with you (hé en 
Babuloni suneklekté). Either actual Babylon or, as most 
likely, mystical Babylon (Rome) as in the Apocalypse. If 
Peter is in Rome about a.p. 65, there is every reason why 
he should not make that fact plain to the world at large 
and least of all to Nero. It is also uncertain whether é 
suneklekté (found here alone), “the co-elect woman,” means 
Peter’s wife (I Cor. 9:5) or the church in “Babylon.” The 
natural way to take it is for Peter’s wife. Cf. eklektét 
kuriai in II John 1 (also verse 13). Mark my son (Markos 
ho huios mou). So this fact agrees with the numerous state- 
ments by the early Christian writers that Mark, after leav- 
ing Barnabas, became Peter’s “interpreter” and under his 
influence wrote his Gospel. We know that Mark was with 
Paul in Rome some years before this time (Col. 4:10). 

14. With a kiss of love (en philémat: agapés). As in I Cor. 
16:20. The abuse of this custom led to its confinement to 


136 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


men with men and women with women and to its final 
abandonment (Apost. Const. ii. 57, 12). That are in Christ 
(tois en Christoi). This is the greatest of all secret orders 
and ties, one that is open to all who take Christ as Lord and 
Saviour.

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


Most Dovustrut New TestaMent Book 


Every book in the New Testament is challenged by some 
one, as indeed the historicity of Jesus Christ himself is and 
the very existence of God. But it is true that more modern 
scholars deny the genuineness of II Peter than that of any 
single book in the canon. This is done by men like F. H. 
Chase, J. B. Mayor, and R. D. Strachan, who are followers - 
of Christ as Lord and Saviour. One has to admit that the 
case concerning II Peter has problems of peculiar difficulty 
that call for careful consideration and balanced judgment. 
One other word needs to be said, which is that an adverse 
decision against the authenticity of II Peter stands by itself 
and does not affect the genuineness of the other books. It 
is easy to take an extreme position for or against it without 
full knowledge of all the evidence. 


Stow 1n GENERAL ACCEPTANCE 


It was accepted in the canon by the council at Laodicea 
(372) and at Carthage (397). Jerome accepted it for the 
Vulgate, though it was absent from the Peshito Syriac Ver- 
sion. Eusebius placed it among the disputed books, while 
Origen was inclined to accept it. Clement of Alexandria 
accepted it and apparently wrote a commentary on it. It 
is probable that the so-called Apocalypse of Peter (early 
second century) used it and the Epistle of Jude either used 
it or II Peter used Jude. There are undoubted allusions 
also to phrases in II Peter in Aristides, Justin Martyr, 
Ireneus, Ignatius, Clement of Rome. When one considers 
the brevity of the Epistle, the use of it is really as strong as 
139 


140 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


one can expect. Athanasius and Augustine accepted it as 
genuine, as did Luther, while Calvin doubted and Erasmus 
rejected it. It may be said for it that it won its way under 
criticism and was not accepted blindly. 


Ciaims PETRINE AUTHORSHIP 


Not only so, but in fuller form than I Peter 1:1, for the 
writer terms himself “Simon (Symeon in some MSS.) Peter,” 
a fact that has been used against the genuineness. If no 
claim had been made, that would have been considered de- 
cisive against him. Simon (Symeon was the Jewish form 
as used by James in Acts 15:14) is the real name (John 1:42) 
and Peter merely the Greek for Cephas, the nickname given 
by Christ. There is no reason why both could not properly 
be employed here. But the claim to Petrine authorship, if 
not genuine, leaves the Epistle pseudonymous. That was 
a custom among some Jewish writers and even: Christian 
writers, as the spurious Petrine literature testifies (Gospel 
of Peter, Apocalypse of Peter, etc.), works of a heretycal or 
curious nature. Whatever the motive for such a pious fraud, 
the fact remains that II Peter, if not genuine, has to take 
its place with this pseudonymous literature and can hardly 
be deemed worthy of a place in the New Testament. And 
yet there is no heresy in this Epistle, no startling new ideas 
that would lead one to use the name of Simon Peter. It is 
the rather full of edifying and orthodox teaching. | 


Anp PeEeRsonAL EXPERIENCES OF PETER 


The writer makes use of his own contact with Jesus, espe- 
cially at the Transfiguration of Christ (Mark 9:2-8 = Matt. 
17:1-8 =Luke g:28-36). This fact has been used against 
the genuineness of the Epistle on the plea that the writer 
is too anxious, anyhow, to show that he is Symeon Peter 
(1:1). But Bigg rightly replies that, if he had only given 
his name with no personal contacts with Jesus, the name 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 141 


would be called “‘a forged addition.” It is possible also 
that the experience on the Mount of Transfiguration may 
have been suggested by Peter’s use of exodos for his own 
death (1:15), the very word used by Luke (9:31) as the 
topic of discussion between Jesus and Moses and Elijah. 
There is also in 1:13 the use of “tent” (skénoma) for the 
life in the body, like Peter’s use of “tents” (skénas) to Jesus 
at that very time (Mark 9:5 =Matt. 17:4 =Luke 9:33). In 
1:14 Peter also refers to the plain words of Jesus about his 
coming death (John 21:18f.). In 1:15 Peter speaks of his 
own plan for preserving the knowledge of Jesus when he is 
gone (possibly by Mark’s Gospel). All this is in perfect 
keeping with Peter’s own nature. 


AND YET THE EpisTLe DiFFERS IN STYLE FROM FIRST PETER 


This is a fact, though one greatly exaggerated by some 
scholars. There are many points of similarity, for one thing, 
like the habit of repeating words (epichoréged in 1:10 and 
19, debaios in 1:12 and 13 and 15, prophéteia in 1:20 and 3:3, 
etc.). These repetitions occur all through the Epistle as in 
I Peter. “This is a matter of very high importance” (Bigg). 
Again in both Epistles there is a certain dignity of style 
with a tendency to iambic rhythm. There is more quotation 
of the Old Testament in I Peter, but frequent allusion to 
words and phrases in II Peter. There are more allusions 
to words and facts in the Gospels in I Peter than in II 
Peter, though some do occur in II Peter. Besides those al- 
ready given, note 1:8 (Luke 13:7f.), 2:1 (Matt. 10:33), 2:20 
(Matt. 12:45; Luke 11:26), 3:4 (Matt. 24:1ff.), and possibly 
1:3 to Christ’s calling the apostles. Both appear to know 
and use the O.T. Apocrypha. Both are fond of the plural 
of abstract substantives. Both make sparing use of Greek 
particles. Both use the article similarly, idiomatically, and 
sometimes not using it. There are some 361 words in I 
Peter not in II Peter, 231 in II Peter not in I Peter. There 


142 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


are 686 hapax legomena in N.T., 54 in II Peter instead of 
the average of 62, a large number when the brevity of the 
Epistle is considered. There are several ways of explaining 
these variations. One way is to say that they are written 
by different men, but difference of subject has to be borne 
in mind. All writers and artists have an early and a later 
manner. Another solution is that Peter employed different 
amanuenses. Silvanus was the one for I Peter (5:12). Mark 
was Peter’s usual interpreter, but we do not know who was 
the amanuensis for II Peter, if indeed one was used. We 
know from Acts 4:13 that Peter and John were considered 
unlettered men (agrammatoi kai ididtai). II Peter and the 
Apocalypse illustrate this statement. II Peter may have 
more of Peter’s real style than I Peter. 


He Accepts Paut’s EpisTtes AS SCRIPTURE 


This fact (3:15f.) has been used as conclusive proof by 
Baur and his school that Peter could not have written the 
Epistle. after the stern rebuke from Paul at Antioch (Gal. 
2:11f.). But this argument ignores one element in Peter’s 
impulsive nature and that is his coming back as he did with 
Jesus. Paul after that event in Antioch spoke kindly of 
Peter (I Cor. 9:5). Neither Peter nor Paul cherished a 
personal grudge where the Master’s work was involved. It 
is also objected that Peter would not have put Paul’s Epis- 
tles on the level with the O.T. and call them by implication | 
“Scripture.” But Paul claimed the help of the Holy Spirit 
in his writings and Peter knew the marks of the Holy Spirit’s 
power. Besides, in calling Paul’s Epistles Scripture he may 
not have meant to place them exactly on a par with the 
Old Testament. 


THE RESEMBLANCE TO THE EPISTLE OF JUDE 


This is undoubted, particularly between Jude and the 
second chapter of II Peter. Kuhl argues that II Peter 2:1 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 143 


to 3:2 is an interpolation, though the same style runs through- 
out the Epistle. “The theory of interpolation is always a 
last and desperate expedient” (Bigg). In II Peter 2 we 
have the fallen angels, the flood, the cities of the plain with 
Lot, Balaam. In Jude we have Israel in the wilderness, the 
fallen angels, the cities of the plain (with no mention of 
Lot, Cain, Balaam, Korah). Jude mentions the dispute be- 
tween Michael and Satan, quotes Enoch by name. There 
is rather more freshness in Jude than in II Peter, though 
II Peter is more intelligible. Evidently one had the other 
before him, besides other material. Which is the earlier? 
There is no way to decide this point clearly. Every point . 
is looked at differently and argued differently by different 
writers. My own feeling is that Jude was before (just be- 
fore) II Peter, though it is only a feeling and not a conviction. 


ANACHRONISMS 


It used to be said that it was impossible for II Peter to 
have been written in the first century, because it had the 
atmosphere of the second. But one fact is strongly against 
that argument. In II Pet. 3:8 occurs the quotation of Ps. 
go0:4 about the thousand years without any chiliastic turn 
at all, a thing sure to happen in the second century after 
chiliasm had come to have such a swing. Peter’s use of it 
suits the first century, not the second. As a matter of 
fact, the false teachers described in II Peter suit the first 
century precisely if one recalls Paul’s troubles with the 
Judaizers in Galatia and Corinth and with the Gnostics in 
Colosse and Ephesus. ‘Every feature in the description of 
the false teachers and mockers is to be found in the apostolic 


age” (Bigg). 
Tue READERS 


The author says that this is his second Epistle to them 
(3:1), and that means that he is writing to the saints in the 


144 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


five Roman provinces in Asia Minor to whom the first 
Epistle was sent (I Pet. 1:1). Spitta and Zahn deny this on 
the ground that the two Epistles do not discuss the same 
subjects, surely a flimsy objection. Zahn even holds that 
II Peter precedes I Peter and that the Epistle referred to in 
II Pet. 3:1 has been lost. He holds that II Peter was 
addressed to the church in Corinth. He considers the 
readers to be Jews while I Peter was addressed to Gentiles. 
But “there is nothing in II Peter to differentiate its first 
readers from those of I Peter” (Bigg). 


THE PurRPOSE 


Certainly Peter is here concerned chiefly with the heresies 
of that general region in Asia Minor that so disturbed Paul 
(Colossians, Ephesians, Pastoral Epistles) and John (Gospel, 
Epistles, Apocalypse). Paul early foresaw at Miletus these 
wolves that would ravish the sheep (Acts 20:20f.). In I 
Peter he is concerned chiefly with the fiery persecutions that 
are upon them, but here with the heretics that threaten to 
lead them astray. 


BALANCE OF PROBABILITY 


There are difficulties in any decision about the authorship 
and character of II Peter. But, when all things are con- 
sidered, I agree with Bigg that the Epistle is what it pro- 
fesses to be by Simon Peter. Else it is pseudonymous. The 
Epistle more closely resembles the other New Testament 
books than it does the large pseudepigraphic literature of the 
second and third centuries. 


Tue Date 


If we accept the Petrine authorship, it must come before 
his death, which was probably a.p. 67 or 68. Hence the 
Epistle cannot be beyond this date. There are those who 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 145 


argue for a.p. 64 as the date of Peter’s death, but on insuffi- 
cient grounds in my opinion.

CHAPTER I 


1. Simon Peter (Simon Petros). Aleph A K L P have 
Symeon as in Acts 15:14, while B has Simon. The two forms 
occur indifferently in I Macc. 2:3, 65 for the same man. 
Servant and apostle (doulos kai apostolos). Like Rom. 1:1; 
Titus 1:1. To them that have obtained (tois lachousin). Da- 
tive plural articular participle second aorist active of Jag- 
chand, old verb, to obtain by lot (Luke 1:9), here with the: 
accusative (pistin) asin Acts 1:17. Like precious (isotimon). 
Late compound adjective (isos, equal, timé, honor, price), 
here only in N.T. But this adjective (Field) is used in two 
ways, according to the two ideas in timé (value, honor), 
either like in value or like in honor. This second idea is the 
usual one with isotimos (inscriptions and papyri, Josephus, 
Lucian), while polutimos has the notion of price like timé 
in 1:7, 19; 2:4, 6f. The faith which they have obtained is 
like in honor and privilege with that of Peter or any of the 
apostles. With us (hémin). Associative-instrumental case 
after isotimon. Equal to téi hémon (the faith of us). In the 
righteousness (en dikaiosunéi). Definite because of the prep- 
Osition en and the following genitive even though anar- 
throus. The O.T. sense of dikaiosuné applied to God (Rom. 
1:17) and here to Christ. Of our God and Saviour Fesus 
Christ (tou theou hémon kai soteros Iésou Christou). So the 
one article (tou) with theou and sdtéros requires precisely as 
with tou kuriou hemon kai sotéros Iésou Christou (of our 
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ), one person, not two, in 
I:II as in 2:20; 3:2, 18. So in I Pet. 1:3 we have ho theos 
kai pater (the God and Father), one person, not two. The 
grammar is uniform and inevitable (Robertson, Grammar, 
p- 786), as even Schmiedel (Winer-Schmiedel, Grammatik, 

147 


148 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


p- 158) admits: “Grammar demands that one person be 
meant.” Moulton (Pro/., p. 84) cites papyri examples of 
like usage of theos for the Roman emperors. See the same 
idiom in Titus 2:13. The use of theos by Peter as a predicate 
with Jesus Christ no more disproves the Petrine authorship 
of this Epistle than a like use in John 1:1 disproves the 
Johannine authorship of the Fourth Gospel and the same 
use in Titus 2:13 disproves the genuineness of Titus. Peter 
had heard Thomas call Jesus God (John 20:28) and he 
himself had called him the Son of God (Matt. 16:16). 

2. Be multiplied (pléthuntheié). First aorist passive opta- 
tive of p/éthundé in a wish for the future (volitive use) as in 
I Pet. 1:2; Jude 2. In the knowledge (en epignosei). Full 
(additional, epi) knowledge as in 1:8 (only gvdsis in 1:5, 6; 
3:18), but epigndsin again in 1:3, 8; 2:20. As in Colossians, 
so here full knowledge is urged against the claims of the 
Gnostic heretics to special gndsis. Of God and of Fesus our 
Lord (tou theou kai Iésou tou kuriou hémén). At first sight 
the idiom here seems to require one person as in 1:1, though 
there is a second article (tou) before kuriou, and Tésou is a 
proper name. But the text here is very uncertain. Bengel, 
Spitta, Zahn, Nestle accept the short reading of P and some 
Vulgate MSS. and some minuscles with only tou kuriou 
hémon (our Lord) from which the three other readings may 
have come. Elsewhere in II Peter gndsis and epigndsis are 
used of Christ alone. The text of II Peter is not in a good 
state of preservation. 

3. Seeing that his divine power hath granted unto us (hos 
hémin tes theias dunameos autou dedorémenés). Genitive ab- 
solute with the causal particle 40s and the perfect middle 
participle of dared, old verb, to bestow (dorea, gift), usually 
middle as here, in N.T. elsewhere only Mark 15:45. Autou 
refers to Christ, who has “divine power” (tés theias duna- 
meos), since he is theos (1:1). Theios (from theos) is an old 
adjective in N.T. here and verse 4 only, except Acts 17:29, 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 149 


where Paul uses ¢o theion for deity, thus adapting his lan- 
guage to his audience as the papyri and inscriptions show. 
The use of theios with an imperial connotation is very com- 
mon in the papyri and the inscriptions. Deissmann (Bible 
Studies, pp. 360-368) has shown the singular linguistic like- 
ness between II Pet. 1:3 to 11 and a remarkable inscription 
of the inhabitants of Stratonicea in Caria to Zeus Pan- 
hemerios and Hecate dated a.p. 22 (in full in C I H ii No. 
2715 a b). One of the likenesses is the use of fés theias 
dunameods. Peter may have read this inscription (cf. Paul 
in Athens) or he may have used “the familiar forms and 
formule of religious emotion” (Deissmann), “the official . 
liturgical language of Asia Minor.”’ Peter is fond of dunamis 
in this Epistle, and the dunamis of Christ “is the sword 
which St. Peter holds over the head of the False Teachers” 
(Bigg). A/l things that pertain unto life and godliness (panta 
ta pros xoen kai eusebeian). “All the things for life and 
godliness.” The new life in Christ who is the mystery of 
godliness (I Tim. 3:16). Eusebeia with its cognates (eusedbés, 
eusebos, eusebed) occurs only in this Epistle, Acts, and the 
Pastoral Epistles (from ez, well, and sebomai, to worship). 
Of him that called us (tou kalesantos). Genitive of the artic- 
ular first aorist active participle of kaled. Christ called 
Peter and all other Christians. By his own glory and virtue 
(dia doxés kai aretés). So B KL, but Aleph A C P read 
idiai doxéi kai aretéi (either instrumental case “by” or da- 
tive “‘to”). Peter is fond of idios (own, I Pet. 3:1, 5; II 
Pet. 2:16, 22, etc.). ‘‘Glory” here is the manifestation of 
the Divine Character in Christ. For areté see on I Pet. 
2:9 and Phil. 4:8; II Pet. 1:5. 

4. Whereby (di? hon). Probably the “glory and virtue” 
just mentioned, though it is possible to take it with panta 
ta pros, etc., or with hémin (unto us, meaning “through 
whom”). He hath granted (dedorétai). Perfect middle in- 
dicative of dored, for which see verse 3. His precious and 


150 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


exceeding great promises (ta timia kai megista epaggelmata). 
Epaggelma is an old word (from epaggello) in place of the 
common epaggelia, in N.T. only here and 3:13. Timios 
(precious, from timé, value), three times by Peter (I Pet. 
1:7 of faith; 1:19 of the blood of Christ; II Pet. 1:4 of Christ’s 
promises). Megista is the elative superlative used along 
with a positive adjective (timia). That ye may become (hina 
genésthe). Purpose clause with hina and second aorist mid- 
dle subjunctive of ginomai. Through these (dia touton). The 
promises. Partakers (koindnoi). Partners, sharers in, for 
which word see I Pet. 5:1. Of the divine nature (theias 
phuseos). This phrase, like to theion in Acts 17:29, “‘belongs 
rather to Hellenism than to the Bible” (Bigg). It is a 
Stoic phrase, but not with the Stoic meaning. Peter is re- 
ferring to the new birth as I Pet. 1:23 (anagegennémenot). 
The same phrase occurs in an inscription possibly under the 
influence of Mithraism (Moulton and Milligan’s Vocabulary). 
Having escaped (apophugontes). Second aorist active par- 
ticiple of apopheugo, old compound verb, in N.T. only here 
and 2:18, 20, with the ablative here (phthords, old word 
from phtheird, moral decay as in 2:12) and the accusative 
there. By lust (en epithumiai). Caused by, consisting in, 
lust. “‘Man becomes either regenerate or degenerate” 
(Strachan). 

5. Yea, and for this very cause (kai auto touto de). Ad- 
verbial accusative (auto touto) here, a classic idiom, with . 
both kai and de. Cf. kai touto (Phil. 1:29), touto men—touto 
de (Heb. 10:33). ‘‘The soul of religion is the practical part” 
(Bunyan). Because of the new birth and the promises we 
have a part to play. Adding on your part (pareisenegkantes). 
First aorist active participle of pareispherd, old double com- 
pound, to bring in (eispherd), besides (para), here only in 
N.T. All diligence (spouden pasan). Old word from speudé 
to hasten (Luke 19:5f.). This phrase (pasan spoudén) oc- 
curs in Jude 3 with potoumenos and on the inscription in 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 151 


Stratonicea (verse 3) with ispheresthai (certainly a curious 
coincidence, to say the least, though common in the Koiné). 
In your faith (en ti pistei humon). Faith or pistis (strong 
conviction as in Heb. 11:1, 3, the root of the Christian life 
Eph. 2:8) is the foundation which goes through various steps 
up to love (agapé). See similar lists in James 1:30; I Thess. 
1:3; II Thess. 1:3f.; Gal. 5:22f.; Rom. 5:3f.; 8:29f. Hermas 
(Vis. iii. 8. 1-7) has a list called “daughters” of one an- 
other. Note the use of ex (in, on) with each step. Supply 
(epichorégésate). First aorist active imperative of epichoré- 
ged, late and rare double compound verb (epi and choréged 
I Pet. 4:11 from chorégos, chorus-leader, choros and hégeomat, 
to lead), to fit out the chorus with additional (complete) 
supplies. Both compound and simplex (more common) oc- 
cur in the papyri. In 1:11 and already in II Cor. 9:10; 
Gal. 3:5; Col. 2:19. Virtue (areten). Moral power, moral 
energy, vigor of soul (Bengel). See 3. Knowledge (gndsin). 
Insight, understanding (I Cor. 16:18; John 15:15). 

6. Temperance (tén egkrateian). Self-control. Old word 
(from egkratés, en and kratos, one holding himself in as in 
Titus 1:8), in N.T. only here, Acts 24:25; Gal. 5:23. The 
opposite of the pleonexia of the heretics. Patience (ten 
hupomonén). For which see James 1:3. Godliness (tén 
eusebeian). Yor which see verse 3. 

7. Love of the brethren (tén philadelphian). See I Pet. 1:22. 
Love (tén agapén). By deliberate choice (Matt. 5:44). Love 
for Christ as the crown of all (I Pet. 1:8) and so for all men. 
Love is the climax as Paul has it (I Cor. 13:13). 

8. For if these things are yours and abound (tauta gar humin 
huparchonta kai pleonazonta). Present active circumstantial 
(conditional) participles neuter plural of huparchd and ple- 
onazo (see I Thess. 3:12) with dative case humin, “‘these 
things existing for you (or in you) and abounding.” They 
make you to be (kathistésin). “Render” (present active in- 
dicative of kathistémi, old verb, James 3:6), singular because 


152 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


tauta neuter plural. Not idle nor unfruitful (ouk argous 
oude akarpous). Accusative predicative plural with humas 
understood, both adjectives with alpha privative, for argos 
see James 2:20 and for akarpos Matt. 13:22. Knowledge 
(epignosin). “Full (additional) knowledge” as in 1:2. 

9. He that lacketh these things (hoi mé parestin tauta). ““To 
whom (dative case of possession) these things are not (mé 
because a general or indefinite relative clause).” Seeing only 
what is near (muodpazon). Present active participle of muo- 
pazo, a rare verb from muops (in Aristotle for a near-sighted 
man) and that from mued tous Opas (to close the eyes in 
order to see, not to keep from seeing). The only other in- 
stance of mudpazo is given by Suicer from Ps. Dion. Eccl. 
Hier. ii. 3 (mudpasouséi kai apostrephomenéi) used of a soul 
on which the light shines (blinking and turning away). Thus 
understood the word here limits suphlos as a short-sighted 
man screwing up his eyes because of the light. Having 
forgotten (léthen labon). “Having received forgetfulness.” 
Second aorist active participle of /amband and accusative 
lethen, old word, from /éthomai, to forget, here only in N.T. 
See II Tim. 1:5 for a like phrase hupomnésin labon (having 
received remembrance). The cleansing (tou katharismou). 
See Heb. 1:3 for this word for the expiatory sacrifice of 
Christ for our sins as in I Pet. 1:18; 2:24; 3:18. In I Pet. 
3:21 Peter denied actual cleansing of sin by baptism (only 
symbolic). If there is a reference to baptism here, which 
is doubtful, it can only be in a symbolic sense. Old (palai). 
Of the language as in Heb. 1:1. 

10. Wherefore (dio). Because of the exhortation and ar- 
gument in verses 5-9. Give the more diligence (mallon spou- 
dasate). “‘Become diligent (first aorist ingressive active 
imperative of spoudazo as in II Tim. 2:15; II Pet. 1:15) the 
more” (mallon, not less). To make (poieisthai). Present 
middle infinitive of poicd, to make for yourselves. Calling 
and election (klésin kai eklogen). Both words (klésin, the 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 153 


invitation, eklogén, actual acceptance). See for eklogé I 
Thess. 1:4; Rom. 9:11. If ye do (poiountes). Present active 
circumstantial (conditional) - participle of poied, “doing.” 
Ye shall never stumble (ou mé ptaiséte pote). Strong double 
negative (ou mé pote) with first aorist active subjunctive 
of ptaid, old verb to stumble, to fall as in James 2:10; 3:2. 

11. Thus (houtés). As shown in verse 10. Shall be sup- 
plied (epichorégéthésetai). Future passive of epichoréged, for 
which see verse 5. You supply the virtues above and God 
will supply the entrance (Aé eisodos, old word already in 
I Thess. 1:9, etc.). Richly (plousids). See Col. 3:16 for 
this adverb. Into the eternal kingdom (eis ten aidnion basi-- 
leian). The believer’s inheritance of I Pet. 1:4 is here termed 
kingdom, but “eternal” (aidnion feminine same as mas- 
culine). Curiously again in the Stratonicea inscription we 
find ¢és aidniou archés (of the eternal rule) applied to “the 
lords of Rome.” But this is the spiritual reign of God in 
men’s hearts here on earth (I Pet. 2:9) and in heaven. Of 
our Lord and Saviour Fesus Christ (tou kuriou hémon kai 
sotéros Ié@sou Christou). For which idiom see on 1:1. 

12. Wherefore (dio). Since they are possessed of faith 
that conduces to godliness which they are diligently prac- 
tising now he insists on the truth and proposes to do his 
part by them about it. I shall be ready always (melléso aei). 
Future active of me//é (Matt. 24:6), old verb, to be on the 
point of doing and used with the infinitive (present, aorist, 
or future). It is not here a periphrastic future, but rather 
the purpose of Peter to be ready in the future as in the past 
and now (Zahn). To put you in remembrance (humas hupo- 
mimneéskein). Present active infinitive of hupomimnésko, 
old causative compound (Aupo, mimnéské, like our suggest), 
either with two accusatives (John 14:26) or peri with the 
thing as here), “to keep on reminding you of those things” 
(peri touton). Though ye know them (kaiper eidotas). Second 
perfect active concessive participle of oida, agreeing (acc. 


154 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


plural), with Aumas. Cf. Heb. 5:8. Are established (esterig- 
menous). Perfect passive concessive participle of sterizo (I 
Pet. 5:10). The very verb (stérison) used by Jesus to Peter 
(Luke 22:32). In the truth which is with you (en téi parouset 
aletheiai). ‘‘In the present truth” (the truth present to 
you), parouséi present active participle of pareimi, to be be- 
side one. See Col. 1:6 for this use of pardn. Firmly estab- 
lished in the truth, but all the same Peter is eager to make 
them stronger. 

13. I think it right (dikaion hégoumai). Peter considers 
this to be his solemn duty, “right” (dikaion). Cf. Phil. 
3:1; Eph. 6:1. So long as (eph’ hoson). For this phrase see 
Matt. 9:15; Rom. 11:13. Tabernacle (skéndmati). Old word, 
in literal sense in Deut. 33:18 for the usual skéné (Peter’s 
word at the Transfiguration, Mark 9:5), earliest use (in 
N.T. only here, verse 14; Acts 7:46 of the tabernacle of the 
covenant) in this metaphorical sense of life as a pilgrimage 
(I Pet. 1:1; 2:11), though Paul has skévos, so in II Cor. 
$:1, 4. Peter feels the nearness of death and the urgency 
upon him. To stir you up (diegeirein humas). Present ac- 
tive infinitive of diegeiro, late (Arist., Hippocr., Herodian, 
papyri), perfective (dia=thoroughly) compound, to wake 
out of sleep (Mark 4:39), “to keep on rousing you up.” 
By putting you in remembrance (en hupomnesei). Old word, 
from hupomimnésko (verse 12), in N.T. only here, 3:1; ul 
Tim. 15. “By way of reminding you.” 

14. The putting off of my tabernacle (hé apothesis tou skén- 
nomatos mou). For apothesis see on I Pet. 3:21 and for 
skéenoma verse 13. For the metaphor see II Cor. 5:3f. 
Cometh swiftly (tachiné estin). Wate adjective (Theocritus, 
LXX, inscription), in N.T. only here and 2:1. It is not 
clear whether ‘achinos means soon or speedy as in Is. 59:7 
and like tachus in James 1:19, or sudden, like ¢achus in 
Plato (Repudl. 553 D). Either sense agrees with the urgent 
tone of Peter here, whether he felt his death to be near or 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 155 


violent or both. Signified unto me (edelisen moi). First 
aorist active indicative of délod, old verb (from delos), as 
in I Pet. 1:11. Peter refers to the incident told in John 
21:18f., which he knew by personal experience before John 
wrote it down. ! 

15. Peter may also have had an intimation by vision of 
his approaching death (cf. the legend Domine quo vadis) as 
Paul often did (Acts 16:9; 18:9; 21:11; 23:11; a7 i gieeast 
every time (hekastote). As need arises, old adverb, here alone 
in N.T. After my decease (meta ten emén exodon). For 
exodos meaning death see Luke 9:31, and for departure from 
Egypt (way out, ex, hodos) see Heb. 11:22, the only other 
N.T. examples. Here again Peter was present on the Trans- 
figuration mount when the talk was about the “exodus” 
of Jesus from earth. That ye may be able (echein humas). 
Literally, “that ye may have it,” the same idiom with 
echo and the infinitive in Mark 14:8; Matt. 18:25. It is the 
object-infinitive after spoudasé (I will give diligence, for 
which see verse 10). To call these things to remembrance 
(tén toutén mnémén poicisthai). Present middle infinitive of 
poied (as in verse 10). Munémé is an old word (from mnao- 
mai), here alone in N.T. This idiom, like the Latin men- 
tionem facere, is common in the old writers (papyri also both 
for “mention” and “remembrance”), here only in N.T., 
but in Rom. 1:20 we have mneian poioumai (I make men- 
tion). Either sense suits here. It is possible, as Irenzeus 
(iii. 1. 1) thought, that Peter had in mind Mark’s Gospel, 
which would help them after Peter was gone. Mark’s 
Gospel was probably already written at Peter’s suggestion, 
but Peter may have that fact in mind here. 

16. We did not follow (ouk exakolouthésantes). First aorist 
active participle of exakolouthed, late compound verb, to 
follow out (Polybius, Plutarch, LXX, papyri, inscriptions 
as of death following for any Gentile in the temple violating 
the barrier), with emphatic negative ouk, “not having fol- 


1456 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


lowed.” See also 2:2 for this verb. Cunningly devised fables 
(sesophismenois muthois). Associative instrumental case of 
muthos (old term for word, narrative, story, fiction, fable, 
falsehood). In N.T. only here and the Pastoral Epistles 
(I Tim. 1:4, etc.). Perfect passive participle of sophizd, old 
word (from sophos), only twice in N.T., in causative sense 
to make wise (II Tim. 3:15), to play the sophist, to invent 
cleverly (here) and so also in the old writers and in the 
papyri. Some of the false teachers ‘apparently taught that 
the Gospel miracles were only allegories and not facts 
(Bigg). Cf. 2:3 for “feigned words.” When we made known 
unto you (egnorisamen humin). First aorist active indica- 
tive of gndrizd, to make known unto you. Possibly by Peter 
himself. The power and coming (tén dunamin kai parousian). 
These words can refer (Chase) to the Incarnation, just as 
is true of epiphancia in II Tim. 1:10 (second coming in 
I Tim. 6:14), and is true of parousia (II Cor. 7:6 of Titus). 
But elsewhere in the N.T. parousia (technical term in the 
papyri for the coming of a king or other high dignitary), 
when used of Christ, refers to his second coming (II Pet. 
3:4, 12). But we were eye-witnesses (all epoptai genéthentes). 
First aorist passive participle of ginomai, “but having be- 
come eye-witnesses.” Epoptai, old word (from epopto like 
epopteud in I Pet. 2:12; 3:2), used of those who attained the 
third or highest degree of initiates in the Eleusinian mys- 
teries (common in the inscriptions). Cf. autoptés in Luke . 
1:2. Of his majesty (tés ekeinou megaleiotétos). Late and 
rare word (LXX and papyri) from megaleios (Acts 2:11), 
in N.T. only here, Luke 9:43 (of God); Acts 19:27 (of 
Artemis). Peter clearly felt that he and James and John 
were lifted to the highest stage of initiation at the Trans- 
figuration of Christ. Emphatic ekeinou as in II Tim. 2:26. 

17. For he received (labon gar). Second aorist active par- 
ticiple nominative singular of Jamband, “he having received,” 
but there is no finite verb, anacoluthon, changing in verse 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 157 


19 (after parenthesis in 18) to echomen bebaioteron rather 
than ebebaidsen. When there came such a voice to him (phones 
enechthetsés autoi toiasde): Genitive absolute with first 
aorist passive participle feminine singular of pherad (cf. I 
Pet. 1:13), repeated enechtheisan in verse 18. Phdné (voice) 
is used also of Pentecost (Acts 2:6). Toiosde (classical de- 
monstrative) occurs here alone intheN.T. From the excellent 
glory (hupo tés megaloprepous doxés). “By the majestic 
glory.” Megaloprepés, old compound (megas, great, prepei, 
it is becoming), here only in N.T., several times in O.T., 
Apocr. (II Macc. 8:15), adverb in the inscriptions. Prob- 
ably a reference to nephelé phiteiné (bright cloud, shekinah) 
in Matt. 17:5. The words given here from the “voice” 
agree exactly with Matt. 17:5 except the order and the use 
of eis hon rather than en hoi. Mark (9:7) and Luke (9:35) 
have akouete. But Peter did not need any Gospel for his 
report here. 

18. This voice (tautén ten phonen). The one referred to 
in verse 17. We heard (ehousamen). First aorist active in- 
dicative of akoud, a definite experience of Peter. Brought 
(enechtheisan). ‘‘Borne” as in verse 17. When we were 
with him (sun autoi ontes). Present active participle of 
eimi, “being with him.” Jn the holy mount (en toi hagidi 
oret). Made holy by the majestic glory. See Ezek. 28:14 
for “holy mount of God,” there Sinai, this one probably 
one of the lower slopes of Hermon. Peter’s account is inde- 
pendent of the Synoptic narrative, but agrees with it in all 
essentials. 

19. The word of prophecy (ton prophétikon logon). ‘The 
prophetic word.” Cf. I Pet. 1:10, a reference to all the 
Messianic prophecies. Made more sure (bebaioteron). Pred- 
icate accusative of the comparative adjective bebaios (II 
Pet. 1:10). The Transfiguration scene confirmed the Mes- 
sianic prophecies and made clear the deity of Jesus Christ 
as God’s Beloved Son. Some with less likelihood take Peter 


158 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


to mean that the word of prophecy is a surer confirmation 
of Christ’s deity than the Transfiguration. Whereunto (ho1). 
Dative of the relative referring to “the prophetic word made 
more sure.” That ye take heed (prosechontes). Present ac- 
tive participle with zoun (mind) understood, “holding your 
mind upon” with the dative (402). As unto a lamp (hos 
luchnoi). Dative also after prosechontes of luchnos, old word 
(Matt. 5:15). Shining (phainonti). Dative also present 
active participle of phaind, to shine (John 1:5). So of the 
Baptist (John 5:35). In a dark place (en auchméroi topo). 
Old adjective, parched, squalid, dirty, dark, murky, here 
only in N.T., though in Aristotle and on tombstone for a 
boy. Until the day dawn (heds hou hémera diaugasét). First 
aorist active subjunctive of diaugazd with temporal con- 
junction Aeds hou, usual construction for future time. Late 
compound verb diaugazd (Polybius, Plutarch, papyri) from 
dia and augé, to shine through, here only in N.T. The 
day-star (phosphoros). Old compound adjective (phos, light, 
phero, to bring), light-bringing, light-bearer (Lucifer) applied 
to Venus as the morning star. Our word phosphorus is this 
word. In the LXX hedsphoros occurs. Cf. Mal. 4:2 and 
Luke 1:76-79; Rev. 22:16 for “dawn” applied to the Mes- 
siah. Arise (anateiléi). First aorist active subjunctive of 
anatelld (James 1:11; Matt. 5:45). 

20. Knowing this first (touto proton gindskontes). Agree- 
ing with poieite like prosechontes in verse 19. No prophecy 
of Scripture (pasa prophéteia ou). Like the Hebrew /o-kol, 
but also in the papyri as in I John 2:21 (Robertson, Gram- 
mar, p. 753). Is (ginetai). Rather “comes,” “springs” 
(Alford), not “‘is” (estin). Of private interpretation (idias 
epiluseds). Ablative case of origin or source in the predicate 
as with gndmés in Acts 20:3 and with tou theou and ex hémon 
in II Cor. 4:7. “No prophecy of Scripture comes out of 
private disclosure,” not “of private interpretation.” The 
usual meaning of epilusis is explanation, but the word does 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 159 


not occur elsewhere in the N.T. It occurs in the papyri in 
the sense of solution and even of discharge of a debt. Spitta 
urges “dissolved” as the idea here. The verb epilud, to 
unloose, to untie, to release, occurs twice in the N.T., once 
(Mark 4:34) where it can mean “disclose” about parables, 
the other (Acts 19:39) where it means to decide. It is the 
prophet’s grasp of the prophecy, not that of the readers 
that is here presented, as the next verse shows. 

21. For (gar). The reason for the previous statement 
that no prophet starts a prophecy himself. He is not a self- 
starter. Came (énechthé). First aorist passive indicative of 
phero (verses 17f.). By the will of man (thelemati anthropou). - 
Instrumental case of theléma. Prophecy is of divine origin, 
not of one’s private origination (idias epiluseds). Moved 
by the Holy Ghost (hupo pneumatos hagiou pheromenoi). 
Present passive participle of pherd, moved from time to 
time. There they “spoke from God.” Peter is not here 
warning against personal interpretation of prophecy as the 
Roman Catholics say, but against the folly of upstart 
prophets with no impulse from God. 


CHAPTER II 


1. But there arose (egenonto de). Second aorist middle in. 
dicative of ginomai (cf. ginetai in 1:20). False prophets also 
(kai pseudoprophétai). In contrast with the true prophets 
just pictured in 1:20f. Late compound in LXX and Philo, 
common in N.T. (Matt. 7:15). Allusion to the O.T. times 
like Balaam and others (Jer. 6:13; 28:9; Ezek. 13:9). False 
teachers (pseudodidaskaloi). Late and rare compound (pseu- 
dés, didaskalos) here alone in N.T. Peter pictures them as 
in the future here (esontai, shall be) and again as already 
present (eisin, are, verse 17), or in the past (eplanéthésan, 
they went astray, verse 15). Shall privily bring in (paret- 
saxousin). Future active of pareisagd, late double com- 
pound pareisagé, to bring in (eisagd), by the side (para), as 
if secretly, here alone in N.T., but see pareisaktous in Gal. 
2:4 (verbal adjective of this same verb). Destructive herestes 
(haireseis apoleias). Descriptive genitive, “heresies of de- 
struction” (marked by destruction) as in Luke 16:8. Haz- 
resis (from haired) is simply a choosing, a school, a sect like 
that of the Sadducees (Acts 5:17), of the Pharisees (Acts 
15:5), and of Christians as Paul admitted (Acts 24:5). These 
“tenets” (Gal. 5:20) led to destruction. Denying (arnou- . 
menoi). Present middle participle of arneomai. This the 
Gnostics did, the very thing that Peter did, alas (Matt. 
26:70) even after Christ’s words (Matt. 10:33). Even the 
Master (kai ton despotén). Old word for absolute master, 
here of Christ as in Jude 4, and also of God (Acts 4:24). 
Without the evil sense in our “despot.” That bought them 
(ton agorasanta autous). First aorist active articular par- 
ticiple of agorazd, same idea with /utrod in I Pet. 1:18f. 
These were professing Christians, at any rate, these heretics. 

160 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 161 


Swift destruction (tachinén apileian). See 1:14 for tachinén 
and note repetition of apdleian. This is always the tragedy 
of such false prophets, the fate that they bring on (epagontes) 
themselves. 

2. Lascivious doings (aselgeiais). Associative instrumental 
case after exakolouthésousin (future active, for which verb 
see 1:16). See I Pet. 4:3 for this word. By reason of whom 
(di’ hous). “Because of whom” (accusative case of relative, 
referring to polloi, many). 4uton (their) refers to pseudodi- 
daskaloi (false teachers) while polloi to their deluded fol- 
lowers. See Rom. 2:23f. for a picture of such conduct by 
Jews (quotation from Is. 52:5, with d/asphémed used as here 
with di’ humas, because of you). The way of truth (hé hodos 
tes alétheias). Hodos (way) occurs often in N.T. for Chris- 
tianity (Acts 9:2; 16:17; 18:25; 22:4; 24:14). This phrase 
is in Gen. 24:48 as “the right road,” and that is what Peter 
means here. So Ps. 119:30. See again 2:16, 21, 

3. In covetousness (en pleonexiai). As did Balaam (verse 
15). These licentious Gnostics made money out of their 
dupes. A merely intellectual Gnosticism had its fruit in 
immorality and fraud. With feigned words (plastois logois). 
Instrumental case. Plastos is verbal adjective (from plasso, 
to mould as from clay, for which see Rom. 9:20), here only 
in N.T. “With forged words.” See sample in 3:4. Shall 
make merchandise of you (humas emporeusontai). Future 
middle of emporeuomai (from emporos, a travelling mer- 
chant), old word, to go in for trade, in N.T. only here and 
James 4:13, which see. Cf. our emporium (John 2:16, 
market house). Whose sentence (hois to krima). ‘For whom 
(dative case) the sentence” (verdict, not process krisis). 
Now from of old (ekpalai). Wate and common compound 
adverb, in N.T. only here and 3:5. Lingereth not (ouk arget). 
“Ts not idle,” old verb, arged (from argos not working, alpha 
privative and ergon), here only in N.T. Slumbereth not (ou 
nustazei). Old and common verb (from nué to nod), in 


162 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


N.T. only here and Matt. 25:5. Note apdleia (destruction) 
three times in verses I to 3. 

4. For if God spared not (2i gar ho theos ouk epheisato). 
First instance (gar) of certain doom, that of the fallen 
angels. Condition of the first class precisely like that in 
Rom. 11:21 save that here the normal apodosis (humon ou 
pheisetat) is not expressed as there, but is simply implied 
in verse g by oiden kurios ruesthai (the Lord knows how to 
deliver) after the parenthesis in verse 8. Angels when they 
sinned (aggelon hamartésanton). Genitive case after epheisato 
(first aorist middle indicative of pheidomai) and anarthrous 
(so more emphatic, even angels), first aorist active participle 
of hamartanod, “having sinned.” Cast them down to hell 
(tartarosas). First aorist active participle of sartarod, late 
word (from tartaros, old word in Homer, Pindar, LXX Job 
40:15; 41:23, Philo, inscriptions, the dark and doleful abode 
of the wicked dead like the Gehenna of the Jews), found 
here alone save in a scholion on Homer. Tartaros occurs in 
Enoch 20:2 as the place of punishment of the fallen angels, 
while Gehenna is for apostate Jews. Committed (paredoken). 
First aorist active indicative of paradidomi, the very form 
solemnly used by Paul in Rom. 1:21, 26, 28. To pits of 
darkness (seirois zophou). Zophos (kin to gnophos, nephos) 
is an old word, blackness, gloom of the nether world in 
Homer, in N.T. only here, verse 17; Jude 13; Heb. 12:18. 
The MSS. vary between seirais (seira, chain or rope) and 
seirois (seiros, old word for pit, underground granary). 
Seirois is right (Aleph A B C), dative case of destination. 
To be reserved unto judgment (eis krisin teroumenous). Present 
(linear action) passive participle of téred. “Kept for judg- 
ment.” Cf. I Pet. 1:4. Aleph A have kolazomenous térein 
as in verse 9. Note krisis (act of judgment). 

s. The ancient world (archaiou kosmou). Genitive case 
after epheisato (with ei understood) repeated (the second 
example, the deluge). This example not in Jude. Absence 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 163 


of the article is common in the prophetic style like II Peter. 
For archaios see Luke 9:8. Preserved (ephulaxen). Still 
part of the long protasis with ¢, first aorist active indicative 
of phulassd. With seven others (ogdoon). “Eighth,” predi- 
cate accusative adjective (ordinal), classic idiom usually 
with auton. Seel Pet. 3:20 for this same item. Some take 
ogdoon with kéruka (eighth preacher), hardly correct. 4 
preacher of righteousness (dikaiosunés keruka). “Herald” as 
in I Tim. 2:7; II Tim. 1:11 alone in N.T., but kérussd is 
common. It is implied in I Pet. 3:20 that Noah preached 
to the men of his time during the long years. When he 
brought (epaxas). First aorist active participle (instead of 
the common second aorist active epagagin) of eisagd, old ~ 
compound verb to bring upon, in N.T. only here and Acts 
5:28 (by Peter herealso). 4 flood (kataklusmon). Old word 
(from katakluxd, to inundate), only of Noah’s flood in N.T. 
(Matt. 24:38.; Luke 17:27; II Pet. 2:5). Upon the world

of tephrod, late word from tephra, ashes (in Dio Cassius of an 
eruption of Vesuvius, Philo), here aloneinN.T. The cities of 
Sodom and Gomorrah (poleis Sodomin kai Gomorrdas). Geni- 
tive of apposition after poleis (cities), though it makes sense 
as possessive genitive, for Jude 7 speaks of the cities around 
these two. The third example, the cities of the plain. See 
Gen. 19:24f. Condemned them (katekrinen). First aorist 
active indicative of katakrind, still part of the protasis with e7. 
With an overthrow (katastrophéi). Instrumental case or even 
dative like thanatoi with katakrind in Matt. 20:18. But 
Westcott and Hort reject the word here because not in B C 
Coptic. Having made them (tethetkos). Perfect active par- 
ticiple of zith@mi. An example (hupodeigma). For which 
see James 5:10; John 13:15. Cf. I Pet. 2:21. Unto those 


1644 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


that should live ungodly (mellonton asebesin). Rather, “unto 
ungodly men of things about to be” (see Heb. 11:20 for this 
use of mellonton). But Aleph A C K L read asebein (present 
active infinitive) with mellonton =asebésonton (future active 
participle of asebed), from which we have our translation. 

7. And delivered (kai erusato). First aorist middle of 
ruomai as in Matt. 6:13, still part of the protasis with ¢i. 
Righteous Lot (dikaion Lot). This adjective dikaios occurs

aselgeiai anastrophés). “By the life in lasciviousness of the 
lawless.” Athesmos (alpha privative and thesmos), late and

participle of enkatoiked, old but rare double compound, here

Accusative of time and ablative with ex. Same idiom in 
Ps. 96:2 for the more common ex Aémeras eis hémeran.

basanizo, old word, to test metals, to-torment (Matt. 8:29).

in Matt. 7:11; James 4:17. The godly (eusebeis). Old 
anarthrous adjective (from ez and sebomai, to worship), in

Present active infinitive of téred after oiden. Unrighteous 
(adikous). As in I Pet. 3:18. Under punishment (kolaxo- 
menous). Present passive participle of ko/azo, old verb (from 
kolos, lopped off), in N.T. only here and Acts 4:21. Present 
tense emphasises continuity of the punishment. See kolasin 
aionion in Matt. 25:46. 

10. Chiefly (malista). Especially. He turns now to the 
libertine heretics (verses 2,7). After the flesh (opiso sarkos).

word (from miaind Tit. 1:15), here only in N.T. Despise 
dominion (kuriotétos kataphronountas). Kuriotés is ate word

Titus. 1:7. They tremble not to rail at dignities (doxas ou 
tremousin blasphémountes). ‘They tremble not blaspheming 
dignities.” Trem@ is old verb (Mark 5:33), used only in 
present as here and imperfect. Here with the complemen- 
tary participle d/asph?mountes rather than the infinitive 
blasphemein. See Jude 8. Perhaps these dignities (doxas) 
are angels (evz/). 

11. Whereas (hopou). Loose use of hopou (in Xenophon) = 
“wherein.” Though greater (meizones ontes). Than the evil 
doxai. Concessive participle and comparative adjective. In 


166 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT

(alive), Jude 10; Rev. 4, 6-9. Without reason (aloga). Old

stroyed (kai phthoran). “And for destruction” just like a 
beast of prey caught. See 1:4. In matters whereof they are 
ignorant (en hois agnoousin). ‘In which things they are 
ignorant.” Here en hois=en toutois ha (in those things 
which), a common Greek idiom. For agnoeo (present active 
indicative) see I Thess. 4:13 and I Tim. 1:7 for alike picture 
of loud ignoramuses posing as professional experts. Shall 
in their destroying surely be destroyed (en téi phthorai auton 
phtharésontai). Second future passive of phtheird. Rhe- 
torical Hebraism in the use of en phthorai (same root as 
phthetro), word four times in II Peter. See Jude 10. 

13. Suffering wrong (adikoumenoi). Present middle or 
passive participle of adiked to do wrong. So Aleph B P, 
but A C K L have komioumenoi (future middle participle 
of komizd), shall receive. As the hire: of wrong-doing (mis- 
thon adikias). The Elephantine papyrus has the passive of 
adikeo in the sense of being defrauded, and that may be the 
idea here. Peter plays on words again here as often in II 
Peter. The picture proceeds now with participles like hégou- 
menot (counting). Pleasure (hédonén). See James 4:1, 3. 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 167 


To revel in the daytime (tén en hémerai truphén). “The in 
the daytime revel” (old word ¢ruphé from thrupto, to ener- 
vate, in N.T. only here and Luke 7:25). Spots (spiloi). 
Old word for disfiguring spot, in N.T. only here and Eph. 
5:27. Blemishés (mimoi). Old word for blot (kin to mud), 
only here in N.T. See I Pet. 1:19 for amdmos kai aspilos. 
Revelling (entruphontes). Present active participle of en- 
truphad, old compound fér living in luxury, only here in 
N.T. In their love-feasts.(en tais agapais). So B Sah, but 
Aleph A C K L P read apatais (in their deceivings). If 
agapais is genuine as it is in Jude 12, they are the only N.T. 
examples of this use of agapé. While they feast with you 
(suneudchoumenoi). Present passive participle of late and 
rare verb suneudched (sun, together, and eudched, to feed 
abundantly) to entertain with. Clement of Alex. (Paed. 
ii. 1. 6) applies eudchia to the agapé. 

14. Of adultery (moichalidos). Rather, “of an adulteress,”’ 
like James 4:4. Vivid picture of a man who cannot see a 
woman without lascivious thoughts toward her (Mayor). . 
Cf. Matt. 5:28. That cannot cease (akatapastous). Reading 
of A B in place of akatapaustous (alpha privative and verbal 
of katapaus, to cease). “Unable to stop.” This a late 
verbal, only here in N.T. It is probable that akatapastous 
is merely a misspelling of akatapaustous. From sin (hamar- 
tias). Ablative case as in I Pet. 4:1 (hamartias). Insatiable 
lust. Enticing (deleazontes). Present active participle of 
deleazd, to catch by bait as in verse 18 and James 1:14. 
Unsteadfast (asteriktous). Late verbal adjective (alpha priva~ 
tive and siériza), in Longinus and Vettius Valens, here alone 
in N.T. Exercised (gegumnasmenén). Perfect passive pred- 
icate participle with echontes, from gumuazo precisely as in 
Heb. ¢:14. Rhetorical metaphor from the gymnasium. In

Children of cursing (kataras tekna). Hebraism like rekna 
hupakoés in I Pet. 1:14 =accursed (kataratot). 


168 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


15. Forsaking (kataleipontes). Present active participle of 
kataleipo (continually leaving) or katalipontes (second aorist 
active), having left. The right way (eutheian hodon). “‘The 
straight way” of I Sam. 12:23 (cf. Matt. 7:13f. for this 
use of hodos), “the way of truth” (2:2). They went astray 
(eplanéthésan). First aorist passive indicative of planad, 
like Mark 12:24. The way of Balaam (te hoddi tou Balaam). 
Associative instrumental case after exakolouthésantes, for 
which verb see 1:16; 2:2. These false teachers, as shown in 
verse 13, followed the way of Balaam, “who loved the hire 
of wrong-doing” (hos misthon adikias égapésen). 

16. But he was rebuked (elegxin de eschen). “But he had 
rebuke.” Second aorist active indicative of echd and accusa- 
tive of elegxis (late word from elegchi, a periphrasis for 
elegcho, here only in N.T. For his own transgression (idias 
paranomias). Objective genitive of paranomia, old word 
(from paranomos lawbreaker), here only in N.T. 4 dumb 
ass (hupozugion aphonon). Dumb is without voice, old word 
for idols and beasts. The adjective hupozugios (hupo zugon 
on) ‘being under a yoke,” is applied to the ass as the com- 
mon beast of burden (papyri, Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 
160), in N.T. only here and Matt. 21:5. Spake (phthegxa- 
menon). First aorist middle participle of phtheggomai, old 
verb, to utter a sound, in N.T. only here, verse 18, Acts 
4:18. Stayed (ekdlusen). First aorist active indicative of 
kolud, to hinder. Madness (paraphronian). Only known . 
example of this word instead of the usual paraphrosuné or 
paraphronésis. It is being beside one’s wits. 

17. Without water (anudroi). As in Matt. 12:43; Luke 
11:24. Old word for common and disappointing experience 
of travellers in the orient. Mists (homichlai). Old word for 
fog, here alone in N.T. Driven by a storm (hupo lailapos 
elaunomenai). Lailaps is a squall (Mark 4:37; Luke 8. 23, 
only other N.T. examples). See James 3:4 for another ex- 
ample of elauné for driving power of wind and waves. For 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 169 


whom (hois). Dative case of personal interest. The black- 
ness (ho zophos). See verse 4 for this word. Hath been re- 
served (teterétai). Perfect passive participle of séred, for 
which see verses 4andg.

jective (huper and ogkos, a swelling, swelling above and 
beyond), in N.T. only here and Jude 16. Of vanity (matai- 
otétos). Late and rare word (from mataios, empty, vain), 
often in LXX, in N.T. here, Rom. 8:20; Eph. 4:17. By 
lasciviousness (aselgeiais). Instrumental plural, “by lascivi- 
ous acts.” Note asyndeton as in 1:9, 17. Those who are 
just escaping (tous oligds apopheugontas). SoAB read oligos 
(slightly, a little), while Aleph C K L P read ontos (actually). 
Oligés late and rare, only here in N.T. So again the Textus 
Receptus has apophugontas (second aorist active participle, 
clean escaped) while the correct text is the present active 
apopheugontas. From them that live in error (tous en planéi 
anastrephomenous). Accusative case after apopheugontas 
(escaping from) according to regular idiom. Peter often 
uses anastrepho and anastrophe. 

19. Liberty (eleutherian). Promising “personal liberty,” 
that is license, after the fashion of advocates of liquor today, 
not the freedom of truth in Christ (John 8:32; Gal. 5:1, 13). 
Themselves bondservants (autoi douloi). “Themselves slaves” 
of corruption and sin as Paul has it in Rom. 6:20. Of whom 
(Adi). Instrumental case, but it may mean “of what.” 
Is overcome (héttétai). Perfect passive indicative of éttad 
(from hétton, less) old verb, in N.T. only here, verse 20; 
II Cor. 12:13. Of the same (toutdi). “By this one (or 
thing).” Is brought into bondage (dedoulotai). Perfect pas- 
sive indicative of doulod. Like Paul again (Rom. 6:16, 18; 
8:21). 

20. After they have escaped (apophugontes). Second aorist 
active participle here (see verse 18). The defilements (ta 
miasmata). Old word miasma, from miaind, here only in 


170 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


N.T. Our “miasma.” The body is. sacred to God. Cf. 
miasmou in verse 10. They are again entangled (palin em- 
plakentes). Second aorist passive participle of empleké, old 
verb, to inweave (noosed, fettered), in N.T. only here and 
II Tim. 2:4. Overcome (héttontai). Present passive indica- 
tive of héttaod, for which see verse 19, “are repeatedly 
worsted.” Predicate in the condition of first class with ei. 
It is not clear whether the subject here js “the deluded 
victims” (Bigg) or the false teachers themselves (Mayor). 
See Heb. 10:26 for a parallel. Therein (toutois). So locative 
case (in these “‘defilements”), but*it can be instrumental 
case (“‘by these,” Strachan). With them (autois). Dative 
of disadvantage, “for them.” Than the Jirst (ton proton). 
Ablative case after the comparative cheirona. See this moral 
drawn by Jesus (Matt. 12:45; Luke11:26),. 

21. Lt were better (kreitton én). Apodosis of a condition 
of second class without az, as is usual with clauses of pos- 
sibility, propriety, obligation (Matt. 26:24; I Cor. 5:10; 
Rom. 7:7; Heb. 9:26). Not to have known (mé epegnokenai). 
Perfect active infinitive of epiginasko (cf. epignosei, verse 
20) to know fully. The way of righteousness (t@n hodon tés 
dikatosunés). For the phrase see Matt. 21 233, also the way 
of truth (2:2), the straight way (2:15). After knowing it 
(epignousin). Second aorist active participle of epigindskd 
(just used) in the dative plural agreeing with autois (for 
them). To turn back (hupostrepsai). First aorist active in. 
finitive of hupostrepho, old and common verb, to turn back, 
to return. From (ek). Out of. So in Acts 12:25 with 
hupostrephd. With ablative case. See Rom. 7:12 for hagia 
applied to hé entolé (cf. I Tim. 6:14). II Peter strikes a 
high ethical note (1:¢ff.). Delivered (paradotheisés). First 
aorist passive participle feminine ablative singular of para- 
didomi. 

22. It has happened (sumbebéken). Perfect active indica- 
tive of sumbaind, for which see I Pet. 4:12. According to 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 171 


the true proverb (to tés aléthous paroimias). “The word (fo 
used absolutely, the matter of, as in Matt. 21:21; James 4:14) 
of the true proverb” (paroimia a wayside saying, for which 
see John 10:6; 16:25, 29). The first proverb here given 
comes from Prov. 26:11. Exerama is a late and rare word 
(here only in N.T., in Diosc. and Eustath.) from exerad, to 
vomit. The sow that had washed (his lousamené). His, old 
word for hog, here only in N.T. Participle first aorist direct 
middle of Joud shows that it is feminine (anarthrous). This 
second proverb does not occur in the O.T., probably from 
a Gentile source because about the habit of hogs. Epictetus 
and other writers moralize on the habit of hogs, having once _ 
bathed in a filthy mud-hole, to delight in it. To wallowing 
(eis kulismon). ‘To rolling.” Late and rare word (from 
kulio, Mark g:20), here only in N.T. In the mire (borborou). 
Objective genitive, old word for dung, mire, here only in 
N.T. J. Rendel Harris (Story of Ahikar, p. LXVII) tells 
of a story about a hog that went to the bath with people 
of quality, but on coming out saw a stinking drain and went 
and rolled himself in it. 


CHAPTER III 


1. Beloved (agapétoi). With this vocative verbal (four 
times in this chapter), Peter “turns away from the Libertines 
and their victims” (Mayor). This is now the second epistle 
that I write unto you (tauten édé deuteran humin grapho 
epistolén). Literally, “This already a second epistle I am 
writing to you.” For édé see John 21:24. It is the predicate 
use of deuteran epistolén in apposition with tautén, not “this 
second epistle.”” Reference apparently to I Peter. And in 
both of them (en hais). ‘In which epistles.” I stir up 
(diegeiro). Present active indicative, perhaps conative, “I 
try to stir up.” See 1:13. Mind (dianoian). Understand- 
ing (Plato) as in I Pet. 1:13. Sincere (eilikriné). Old ad- 
jective of doubtful etymology (supposed to be heilé, sun- 
light, and krind, to judge by it). Plato used it of ethical 
purity (psuché eilikrinés) as here and Phil. 1:10, the only 
N.T. examples. By putting you in remembrance (en hupo- 
mnései). As in 1:13. 

2. That ye should remember (mnésthénai). First aorist 
passive (deponent) infinitive of mimnéskd, to remind. Pur- 
pose (indirect command) is here expressed by this infinitive. 
Imperative in Jude 17. Spoken before (proeirémenén). Per- 
fect passive participle of proeipon (defective verb). Geni- 
tive case rématon after mnésthenai. And the commandment 
(kat tés entolés). Ablative case with hupo (agency). Of the 
Lord and Saviour through your apostles (ton apostolon humon 
tou kuriou kai sotéros). Humén (your) is correct, not hémon 
(our). But the several genitives complicate the sense. If 
dia (through) occurred before son apostolon, it would be 
clear. It is held by some that Peter would not thus speak 
of the twelve apostles, including himself, and that the forger 

172 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 173 


here allows the mask to slip, but Bigg rightly regards this 
a needless inference. The meaning is that they should re- 
member the teaching of their apostles and not follow the 
Gnostic libertines. 

3. Knowing this first (touto proton gindskontes). Present 
active participle of gindskd. See 1:20 for this identical 
phrase. Nominative absolute here where accusative ginds- 
kontas would be regular. Peter now takes up the parousta 
(1:16) after having discussed the dunamis of Christ. In 
the last days (ep’ eschaton ton hémerén). ‘‘Upon the last of 
the days.” Jude 18 has it ep’ eschatou chronou (upon the 
last time). In I Pet. 1:5 it is en kairdi eschatoi (in the last 
time), while I Pet. 1:20 has ep’ eschatou ton chronodn (upon 
the last of the times). John has usually s@i eschatéi hémerat 
(on the last day, 6:39f.). Here eschaton is a predicate ad- 
jective like summus mons (the top of the mountain). Mock- 
ers with mockery (empaigmonéi empaiktai). Note Peter's 
play on words again, both from empaizd (Matt. 2:16), to 
trifle with, and neither found elsewhere save empaiktés in 
Jude 18 and Is. 3:4 (playing like children). 

4. Where is the promise of his coming? (pou estin hé epag- 
gelia tés parousias autou;). This is the only sample of the 
questions raised by these mockers. Peter had mentioned 
this subject of the parousia in 1:16. Now he faces it squarely. 
Peter, like Paul (I Thess. 5:1f.; II Thess. 2:1f.), preached 
about the second coming (1:16; Acts 3:20f.), as Jesus him- 
self did repeatedly (Matt. 24:34) and as the angels promised 
at the Ascension (Acts 1:11). Both Jesus and Paul (II 
Thess. 2:1f.) were misunderstood on the subject of the time 
and the parables of Jesus urged readiness and forbade setting 
dates for his coming, though his language in Matt. 24:34 
probably led some to believe that he would certainly come 
while they were alive. From the day that (aph’ hes). “From 
which day.” See Luke 7:45. Fell asleep (ekoiméthésan). 
First aorist passive indicative of koimad, old verb, to put 


174 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


sleep, classic euphemism for death (John 11:11) like our 
cemetery (sleeping-place). Continue (diamenei). Present 
active indicative of diamend, to remain through (Luke 1:22). 
In statu quo. As they were (houtos). “Thus.” From the 
beginning of creation (ap’ arches ktiseds). Precisely so in 
Mark 10:6, which see. 

5. For this they wilfully forget (lanthanei gar autous touto 
thelontas). Literally, “for this escapes them being willing.” 
See this use of /anthand (old verb, to escape notice of, to be 
hidden from) in Acts 26:26. The present active participle 
thelontas (from theld, to wish) has almost an adverbial sense 
here. Compacted (sunestisa). See Paul’s sunestéken (Col. 
1:17) “consist.” Second perfect active (intransitive) par- 
ticiple of sunistémi, feminine singular agreeing with gé (near- 
est to it) rather than with ouranoi (subject of ésan imper- 
fect plural). There is no need to make Peter mean the 
Jewish mystical “‘seven heavens” because of the plural which 
was used interchangeably with the singular (Matt. 5:of.). 
Out of water and amidst water (ex hudatos kai di’ hudatos). 
Out of the primeval watery chaos (Gen. 1:2), but it is not 
plain what is meant by di’ Audatos, which naturally means 
“by means of water,” though dia with the genitive is used 
for a condition or state (Heb. 12:1). The reference may be 
to Gen. 1:9, the gathering together of the waters. By the 
word of God (toi tou theou logoi). Instrumental case logot, 
“by the fiat of God” (Gen. 1:3; Heb. 11:3 rémati theou). ; 

6. By which means (di’ hin). The two waters above or 
the water and the word of God. Mayor against the MSS. 
reads di’ hou (singular) and refers it to Jogéi alone. Being 
overflowed (kataklustheis). First aorist passive participle of 
katakluzd, old compound, here only in N.T., but see kata- 
klusmos in 2:5. With water (hudati). Instrumental case of 
hudor. Perished (apileto). Second aorist middle indicative 
of apollumi. 

7. That now are (nun). “The now heavens” over against 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 175 


“the then world” (ho tote kosmos verse 6). By the same-word 
(toi autoi logoi). Instrumental case again referring to Jogot 
in verse 6. Have been stored up (tethésaurismenoi eisin). 
Perfect passive indicative of ¢hésaurizd, for which verb see 
Matt. 6:19; Luke 12:21. For fire (puri). Dative case of 
pur, not with fire (instrumental case). The destruction of 
the world by fire is here pictured as in Joel 2:30f.; Ps. 50:3. 
Being reserved (téroumenoi). Present passive participle of 
tered, for which see 2:4. Against (eis). Unto. As in 2:4, 9 
and see I Pet. 1:4 for the inheritance reserved for the saints 
of God. 

8. Forget not this one thing (hen touto mé lanthanetd humas). 
Rather, “‘let not this one thing escape you.” For Janthaneto 
(present active imperative of /anthand) see verse 5. The 
“one thing” (hen) is explained by the Aoti (that) clause 
following. Peter applies the language of Ps. 89 (g0):4 about 
the eternity of God and shortness of human life to “the 
impatience of human expectations” (Bigg) about the second 
coming of Christ. ‘“‘The day of judgment is at hand (I Pet. 
4:7). It may come tomorrow; but what is tomorrow? 
What does God mean by a day? It may be a thousand 
years” (Bigg). Precisely the same argument applies to those 
who argue for a literal interpretation of the thousand years 
in Rev. 20:4-6. It may be a day or a day may be a thou- 
sand years. God’s clock (para kuridi, beside the Lord) does 
not run by our timepieces. The scoffers scoff ignorantly. 

g. Is not slack concerning his promise (ou bradunei tes 
epaggelias). Ablative case epaggelias after bradunei (pres- 
ent active indicative of bradund, from bradus, slow), old verb, 
to be slow in, to fall short of (like /eipetai sophias in James 
1:5), here and I Tim. 3:15 only in N.T. Slackness (bradu- 
téta). Old substantive from bradus (James 1:19), here only 
in N.T. God is not impotent nor unwilling to execute his 
promise. To youward (eis humas). Pros rather than eis 
after makrothumei in I Thess. 5:14 and epi in James 5:7, 


176 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


etc. Not wishing (mé boulomenos). Present middle par- 
ticiple of doulomai. Some will perish (verse 7), but that is 
not God’s desire. Any (tinas). Rather than “some” (tines) 
above. Accusative with the infinitive apolesthai (second 
aorist middle of apollumi. God wishes “all” (pantas) to 
come (chérésai first aorist active infinitive of chéred, old 
verb, to make room). See Acts 17:30; Rom. 11:32; I Tim. 
2:4; Heb. 2:9 for God’s provision of grace for all who will 
repent. 

10. The day of the Lord (hémera kuriou). So Peter in Acts 
2:20 (from Joel 3:4) and Paul in I Thess. 5:2, 4; II Thess. 
2:2; I Cor. 5:5; and day of Christ in Phil. 2:16 and day of 
God in 2:12 and day of judgment already in 2:9; 3:7. This 
great day will certainly come (Aéxei). Future active of 
héko, old verb, to arrive, but in God’s own time. As a thief 
(hos kleptes). That is suddenly, without notice. This very 
metaphor Jesus had used (Luke 12:39; Matt. 24:43) and 
Paul after him (I Thess. 5:2) and John will quote it also 
(Rev. 3:3; 16:15). In the which (en héi). The day when 
the Lord comes. Shall pass away (pareleusontai). Future 
middle of parerchomai, old verb, to pass by. With a great 
notse (roizedon). Late and rare adverb (from roized, roizos)— 
Lycophron, Nicander, here only in N.T., onomatopoetic, 
whizzing sound of rapid motion through the air like the 
flight of a bird, thunder, fierce flame. The elements (ta 
stoicheia). Old word (from stoichos a row), in Plato in this 
sense, in other senses also in N.T. as the alphabet, cere- 
monial regulations (Heb. 5:12; Gal. 4:3; 5:1; Col. 2:8). 
Shall be dissolved (luthésetai). Future passive of Jué, to 
loosen, singular because stoicheia is neuter plural. With 
fervent heat (kausoumena). Present passive participle of 
kausod, late verb (from kausos, usually medical term for 
fever) and nearly always employed for fever temperature. 
Mayor suggests a conflagration from internal heat. Bigg 
thinks it merely a vernacular (Doric) future for kausomena 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 177 


(from kaid, to burn). Shall be burned. up (katakaésetat). 
Repeated in verse 12. Second future passive of the com- 
pound verb katakaid, to burn down (up), according to A L. 
But Aleph B K P read heurethésetai (future passive of 
heurisk@, to find) “shall be found.” There are various other 
readings here. The text seems corrupt. 

11. To be dissolved (luomenon). Present passive participle 
(genitive absolute with toutdn panton, these things all) of 
Jud, either the futuristic present or the process of dissolution 
presented. What manner of persons (potapous). Late quali- 
tative interrogative pronoun for the older podapos as in 
Matt. 8:27, accusative case with dei huparchein agreeing 
with humds (you). See 1:8 for huparchd. In all holy living 
and godliness (en hagiais anastrophais kai eusebeiais). “In 
holy behaviours and pieties” (Alford). Plural of neither 
word elsewhere in N.T., but a practical plural in pasa 
anastrophé in I Pet. 1:15. 

12. Looking for (prosdokéntas). Present active participle 
of prosdokad (Matt. 11:3) agreeing in case (accusative plural) 
with Aumas. Earnestly desiring (speudontas). Present ac. 
tive participle, accusative also, of speuddo, old verb, to hasten 
(like our speed) as in Luke 2:16, but it is sometimes transi- 
tive as here either (preferably so) to “hasten on the parou- 
sia” by holy living (cf. I Pet. 2:12), with which idea com- 
pare Matt. 6:10 and Acts 3:19f., or to desire earnestly (Is. 
16:5). Being on fire (puroumenoi). Present passive par- 
ticiple of purod, old verb (from pur), same idea as in verse 
10. Shall melt (teketai). Futuristic present passive indica- 
tive of #2kd, old verb, to make liquid, here only in N.T. 
Hort suggests éxetai (future middle), though Is. 34:4 has 
takésontai (second future passive). The repetitions here 
make “an effective refrain” (Mayor). 

13. Promise (epaggelma). As in 1:4. The reference 1s to 
Is. 65:17f.; 66:22. See also Rev. 21:1. For kainos (new) 
see on Matt. 26:29. For the expectant attitude in pros- 


178 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


dokomen (we look for) repeated from verse 12 and again in 
verse 14, see apekdechometha (we eagerly look for) in Phil. 
3:20.. Wherein (en hois). The new heavens and earth. 
Dwelleth (katoikei). Has its home (oikos). Certainly “right- 
eousness” (dikaiosuné) is not at home in this present world 
either in individuals, families, or nations. 

14. Wherefore (dio). Asin 1:10, 12. Give diligence (spou- 
dasate). As in 1:10. That ye may be found (heurethénai). 
First aorist passive infinitive (cf. heurethésetai in verse 10). 
For this use of heuriskd about the end see II Cor. 5:3; Phil. 
3:9; I Pet. 1:7. Without spot and blameless (aspiloi kai 
amométot). Predicate nominative after heurethénai. See 
2:13 for position words spiloi kai momoi and I Pet. 1:19 for 
amomos (so Jude 24) kai aspilos (so James 1:27). Amodmétos 
(old verbal of mémaomai) only here in N.T. save some MSS. 
in Phil. 2:15. 

15. In his sight (autéi). Ethical dative. Referring to 
Christ. Js salvation (sétérian). Predicate accusative after 
hégeisthe in apposition with makrothumian (long-suffering), 
an opportunity for repentance (cf. I Pet. 3:20). The Lord 
here is Christ. Our beloved brother Paul (ho agapétos adelphos 
Paulos). Paul applies the verbal agapétos (beloved) to 
Epaphras (Col. 1:7), Onesimus (Col. 4:9; Philem. 16), to 
Tychicus (Col. 4:7; Eph. 6:21), and to four brethren in 
Rom. 16 (Epainetus 5, Ampliatus 8, Stachys 9, Persis 12). 
It is not surprising for Peter to use it of Paul in view of 
Gal. 2:9f., in spite of Gal, 2:11-14. Given to him (dotheisan 
autot). First aorist passive participle of diddmi with dative 
case. Peter claimed wisdom for himself, but recognises 
that Paul had the gift also. His language here may have 
caution in it as well as commendation. “St. Peter speaks 
of him with affection and respect, yet maintains the right 
to criticise” (Bigg). 

16. 4s also in all his epistles (hos kai en pasais epistolais). 
We do not know to how many Peter here refers. There is 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 179 


no difficulty in supposing that Peter “received every one of 
St. Paul’s Epistles within a month or two of its publication” 
(Bigg). And yet Peter does not here assert the formation 
of a canon of Paul’s Epistles. Speaking in them of these 
things (Jalon en autais peri touton). Present active participle 
of /aled. That is to say, Paul also wrote about the second 
coming of Christ, as is obviously true. Hard to be under- 
stood (dusnoéta). Late verbal from dus and-noeé (in Aris- 
totle, Lucian, Diog. Laert.), here only in N.T. We know 
that the Thessalonians persisted in misrepresenting Paul.on 
this very subject of the second coming as Hymenaeus and 
Philetus did about the resurrection (II Tim. 2:17) and Spitta 
holds that Paul’s teaching about grace was twisted to mean ~ 
moral laxity like Gal. 3:10; Rom. 3:20, 28; 5:20 (with which 
cf. 6:1 as a case in point), etc. Peter does not say that he 
himself did not understand Paul on the subject of.faith and 
freedom. Unlearned (amatheis).. Old word (alpha privative 
and manthané to learn), ignorant, here only in N.T. Un- 
steadfast (asteriktoi). See on 2:14. Wrest (streblousin). Pres- 
ent active indicative of streblod, old verb (from stredlos 
twisted, strephd, to turn), here only in N.T. The other scrip- 
tures (tas loipas graphas). There is no doubt that the 
apostles claimed to speak by the help of the Holy Spirit 
(I Thess. 5:27; Col. 4:16) just as the prophets of old did 
(II Pet. 1:20f.). Note Joipas (rest) here rather than allas 
(other). Peter thus puts Paul’s Epistles on the same plane 
with the O.T., which was also misused (Matt. 5:21—-44; 
16:3-6; 19:3-10). 

17. Knowing these things beforehand (progindskontes). Pres- 
ent active participle of progindsko as in I Pet. 1:20. CE 
proton gindsko (1:20; 3:1). Hence they are without excuse 
for misunderstanding Peter or Paul on this subject. Be- 
ware (phulassesthe). Present middle imperative of phulasso, 
common verb, to guard. Lest (hina mé). Negative purpose, 
“that not.” Being carried away (sunapachthentes). First 


18 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


aorist passive participle of sunapagod, old verb double com- 
pound, to carry away together with, in N.T. only here and 
Gal. 2:13. With the error (téi planéi). Instrumental case, 
“by the error” (the wandering). Of the wicked (tin athes- 
mon). See on 2:7. Ye fall from (ekpeséte). Second aorist 
active subjunctive with hina mé of ekpipta, old verb, to fall 
out of, with the ablative here (stérigmou, steadfastness, late 
word from stérizd, here alone in N.T.) as in Gal. 5:4. (tés 
charitos exepesate, ye fell out of grace). 

18. But grow (auxanete de). Present active imperative of 
auxano, in contrast with such a fate pictured in verse 17, 
“but keep on growing.” In the grace and knowledge (en 
chariti kat gnosei). Locative case with en. Grow in both. 
Keep it up. See on 1:1 for the idiomatic use of the single 
article (tou) here, “of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.” 
To him (autoi). To Christ. For ever (eis hémeran aionos). 
“Unto the day of eternity.” So Sirach 18:9f. One of the 
various ways of expressing eternity by the use of aién. So 
ets ton aiona in John 6:6; 12:34.

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


THE AUTHOR 


He calls himself Judas, but this was a very common name. 
In the N.T. itself we have Judas Iscariot and Judas not 
Iscariot (John 14:22; also called Judas of James, son or 
brother, Luke 6:6), Judas a brother of our Lord (Matt. 
13:55), Judas of Galilee (Acts 5:37), Judas of Damascus 
(Acts 9:11), Judas Barsabbas (Acts 15:22). The author ex-. 
plains that he is a “slave” of Jesus Christ as James did 
(1:1), and adds that he is also a brother of James. Clement 
of Alexandria thinks that, like James, he deprecated being 
called the brother of the Lord Jesus (as by Hegesippus later) 
as claiming too much authority. Keil identifies him with 
Jude the Apostle (not Iscariot), but that is most unlikely. 
The Epistle is one of the disputed books of Eusebius. It 
was recognized in the canon in the Third Council of Carthage 
(a.D. 397). It appears in the Muratorian Canon (a.D. 170). 


Tue Revation To II PETER 


Beyond a doubt one of these Epistles was used by the 
other, as one can see by comparing particularly Jude 3-18 
and II Peter 2:1-18. As already said concerning II Peter, 
scholars are greatly divided on this point, and in our present 
state of knowledge it does not seem possible to reach a solid 
conclusion. The probability is that not much time elapsed 
between them. Mayor devotes a whole chapter to the dis- 
cussion of the relation between II Peter and Jude and reaches 
the conclusion “that in Jude we have the first thought, in 
Peter the second thought.” That is my own feeling, but it 


is all so subjective that I have no desire to urge the point 
183 


i84 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


unduly. Bigg is equally positive that II Peter comes before 
Jude. 


Tue Use or ApocrypHaL Books 


Jude (verse 14) quotes from “Enoch” by name and says 
that he “‘prophesied.” What he quotes is a combination of 
various passages in the Book of Enoch as we have it now. 
It used to be held that part of Enoch was later than Jude, 
but Charles seems to have disproved that, though the book 
as we have it has many interpolations. Tertullian wanted 
to canonise Enoch because of what Jude says, whereas 
Chrysostom says that the authenticity of Jude was doubted 
because of the use of Enoch. In verse 9 there seems to be 
an allusion to the Assumption of Moses, another apocryphal 
book, but it is the use of “prophesied” in verse 14 about 
Enoch that gave most offence. It is possible, of course, 
that Jude did not attach the full sense to that term. 


THE STYLE 


It is terse and picturesque, with a fondness for triplets. 
The use of the O.T. is very much like that in II Peter. 
Alford notes that it is impassioned invective with epithet on 
epithet, image on image. Bigg remarks on the stern and 
unbending nature of the author, with no pathos and a harsh 
view of things and with frequent use of Pauline phraseology. 
There are some fifteen words not in the rest of the N.T. 
The grammar is less irregular than that of II Peter. There 
is often a poetic ring in his words. 


Tue Purpose 


The author undoubtedly has the Gnostics in mind and is 
seeking to warn his readers against them, as is true of II 
Peter. This same purpose appears in the Johannine Epistles, 
as was true also of Colossians, Ephesians, the Pastoral 


Epistles, 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 185 


THe READERS 


Of this we know nothing at all. Dr. Chase believes that 
the Epistle was sent to Antioch in Syria. That may be true, 
though it is mere conjecture. Any place or places in Asia 
Minor would suit so far as we know. The readers were 
probably both Jewish and Gentile Christians. Jerusalem 
and Alexandria are urged as the place of composition, but 
of that we have no real information. 


THe Date 


This really turns on the genuineness of the Epistle. Ther 
is no clear indication of the date, for the Gnostics describec 
can belong to the first or to the second century. If it wa 
used by II Peter, that would place it slightly before tha’ 
Epistle. The date suggested, 65 to 67 A.D., is purely cot.

1. Servant (doulos). Precisely as James (1:1), only James 
added kuriou (Lord). Brother of ‘fames (adelphos Iakobou). 
Thus Jude identifies himself. But not the “Judas of James” 
(Luke 6:16; Acts 1:13). To them that are called (tois—klétois). 
But this translation (treating k/étois as a substantive like 
Rom. 1:6; I Cor. 1:24) is by no means certain as two parti- 
ciples come in between fois and klétois. Kiétois may be in 
the predicate position (being called), not attributive. But 
see I Pet. 1:1. Beloved in God the Father (en thedi patri 
egapemenots). Perfect passive participle of agapad, but no 
precise parallel to this use of en with agapad. Kept for Fesus 
Christ (Lésou Christoi tetévémenois). Perfect passive parti- 
ciple again with dative, unless it is the instrumental, “kept 
by Jesus Christ,” a quite possible interpretation. 

2. Be multiplied (plethuntheié). First aorist passive opta- 
tive of pléthuné as in I Pet. 1:2 and II Pet. 1:2. 

3. Beloved (agapetoi). As in III John 2. All diligence 
(pasan spouden). As in II Pet. 1:5. Of our common salva- 
tion (peri tés koinés hémon sotérias). See this use of koinos 
(common to all) in Titus 1:4 with pistis, while in II Pet. 1:1 
we have isotimon pistin, which see. I was constrained 
(anagkén eschon). “I had necessity” like Luke 14:18; Heb. 
7:27. To contend earnestly (epagonizesthai). Late and rare 
(in Plutarch, inscriptions) compound, here only in N.T. A 
little additional (epi) striving to the already strong agoni- 
xesthat (agon contest). Cf. I Tim. 6:12 agénizou ton kalon 
agona. For the faith (tei—pistei). Dative of advantage. 
Here not in the original sense of trust, but rather of the 
thing believed as in verse 20 and in Gal. 1:23; 3:23; Phil. 
1:27. Once for all delivered (hapax paradotheiséi). First 

186 


THE EPISTLE OF JUDE 187 


aorist passive participle feminine dative singular of paradi- 
domi, for which see II Pet. 2:21. See also II Thess. 2:15; 
I Cor. 11:2; I Tim. 6:20. 

4. Are crept in (pareiseduésan). Second aorist passive in- 
dicative of pareisdué (-nd), late (Hippocrates, Plutarch, etc.) 
compound of para (beside) and eis (in) and dud to sink or 
plunge, so to slip in secretly as if by a side door, here only 
in N.T. Set forth (progegrammenoi). Perfect passive parti- 
ciple of prographd, to write of beforehand, for which verb 
see Gal. 3:1; Rom. 15:4. Unto this condemnation (eis touto 
to krima). See II Pet. 2:3 for krima and ekpalai. Palai 
here apparently alludes to verses 14 and 15 (Enoch). Un- 
godly men (asebeis). Keynote of the Epistle (Mayor), in 15 
again as in IJ Pet. 2:5; 3:7. Turning (metatithentes). Pres- 
ent active participle of metatithémi, to change, for which verb 
see Gal. 1:6. For the change of “grace” (charita) into “‘las- 
civiousness (eis aselgeian) see I Pet. 2:16; 4:3; II Pet. 2:19; 
3:16. Our only Master and Lord (ton monon despotén kai 
kurion hemon). For the force of the one article for one 
person see on II Pet. 1:1. For despoten of Christ see II Pet. 
2:1. Denying (arnoumenot). So II Pet. 2:1. See also Matt. 
aSieopbolini.5285 Titusia:16;/b John 2:22. 

5. To put you in remembrance (hupomnésai). See II Pet. 
1:12 hupomimnéskein (present active infinitive there, first 
aorist active infinitive here). Though ye know all things once 
for all (eidotas hapax panta). Concessive perfect (sense of 
present) active participle as in II Pet. 1:12, but without 
kaiper. The Lord (kurios). Some MSS. add Jésous. The 
use of kurios here is usually understood to mean the Lord 
Jesus Christ, as Clement of Alex. (4dumbér. p. 133) explains, 
Ex. 23:20, by ho mustikos ekeinos aggelos Iésous (that mys- 
tical angel Jesus). For the mystic reference to Christ see 
I Cor. 10:4, 9; Heb. 11:26. Some MSS. here add ¢heos in- 
stead of [ésous. Afterward (to deuteron). Adverbial accusa- 
tive, “‘the second time.” After having saved the people out

of Egypt. Destroyed (apolesen). First aorist active indicative 
of apollumi, old verb, todestroy. Them that believed not (tous 
mé pisteusantas). First aorist active articular participle of 
pisteud. The reference is to Numb. 14:27-37, when all the 
people rescued from Egypt perished except Caleb and Joshua. 
This first example by Jude is not in II Peter, but is discussed 
inal: Corl rers=117Hebiy 1184422. 

6. And angels (aggelous de). ‘The second example in Jude, 
the fallen angels, accusative case after teteréken (perfect 
active indicative of féred, for which verb see II Pet. 2:4, 7) 
at the end of the verse (two emphatic positions, beginning 
and end of the clause). Kept not (mé térésantas). First 
aorist active participle with negative mé, with play on “kept 
not” and “he hath kept.” Principality (archén). Literally, 
“beginning,” “rule,” (first place of power as in I Cor. 15:24; 
Rom. 8:38). In Acts 1o:11 it is used for ‘“‘corners” (begin- 
nings) of the sheet. In Eph. 6:12 the word is used for evil 
angels. See Deut. 32:8. Both Enoch and Philo (and Milton) 
discuss the fallen angels. But left (alla apolipontas). Second 
aorist active participle of apoleipd, old verb, to leave behind 
(II Tim. 4:13, 20). Their own proper habitation (to idion 
oikétérion). Old word for dwelling-place (from oikétér, dweller 
at home, from okos), in N.T. only here and II Cor. 5:2 (the 
body as the abode of the spirit). In everlasting bonds (desmois 
aidiois). Either locative (in) or instrumental (by, with). 
Aidios (from aei, always), old adjective, in N.T. only here 
and Rom. 1:20 (of God’s power and deity). It is synonymous 
with aidnios (Matt. 25:46). Mayor terms aidios an Aristo- 
telian word, while aidnios is Platonic. Under darkness (hupo 
zophon). See II Pet. 2:4 for zophos. In Wisd. 17:2 we find 
desmioi skotous (prisoners of darkness). Great (megaleés). 
Not in II Pet. 2:9, which see for discussion. 

7. Even as (hos). Just “as.” The third instance (Jude 
passes by the deluge) in Jude, the cities of the plain. The 
cities about them (hai peri autas poleis). These were also

included, Admah and Zeboiim (Deut. 29:23; Hos. 11:8). 
Zoar, the other city, was spared. In like manner (ton 
homoion tropon). Adverbial accusative (cf. hds). Like the 
fallen angels. Having given themselves over to fornication 
(ekporneusasai). First aorist active participle feminine plu- 
ral of ekporneud, late and rare compound (perfective use of 
ek, outside the moral law), only here in N.T., but in LXX 
(Gen. 38:24; Ex. 34:15f., etc.). Cf. aselgeian in verse 4. 
Strange flesh (sarkos heteras). Worrible licentiousness, not 
simply with women not their wives or in other nations, but 
even unnatural uses (Rom. 1:27) for which the very word 
“sodomy” is used (Gen. I9:4-11). The pronoun heteras. 
(other, strange) is not in II Pet. 2:10. Are set forth (pro- 
keintai). Present middle indicative of prokeimai, old verb, 
to lie before, as in Heb. 12:1f. 4s an example (deigma). 
Predicate nominative of deigma, old word (from deiknumi 
to show), here only in N.T., sample, specimen. II Pet. 2:6 
has hupodeigma (pattern). Suffering (hupechousai). Present 
active participle of hupechd, old compound, to hold under, 
often with dikén (right, justice, sentence II Thess. 1:9) to 
suffer sentence (punishment), here only in N.T. Of eternal 
fire (puros aidniou). Like desmois aidiois in verse 7. Cf. 
the hell of fire (Matt. 5:22) and also Matt. 25:46. Jude has 
no mention of Lot. 

8. Yet (mentoi). See John 4:27. In spite of these warn- 
ings. In like manner (homoids). Like the cities of the plain. 
These also (kai houtoi). The false teachers of verse 4. In 
their dreamings (enupniazomenoi). Present middle participle

Plutarch, papyri, LXX (Joel 2:28), here only in N.T. Cf. 
Col. 2:18. Defile (miainousin). Present active indicative 
of minaind, old verb, to stain, with sin (Titus 1:15) as here. 
II Pet. 2:10 has miasmou. Set at nought (athetousin). Pres- 
ent active indicative of atheted, to annul. Both. kuriotes. 


190 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(dominion) and dowxai (dignities) occur in II Pet. 2:10, which 
see for discussion. 

g. Michael the archangel (ho Michaél ho archaggelos). Mi- 
chael is mentioned also in Dan. 10:13, 21; 12:1; Rev. 12:7. 
Archaggelos in N.T. occurs only here and I Thess. 4:16, but 
in Dan. 10:13, 20; 12:1. Contending with the devil (toi 
diaboloi diakrinomenos). Present middle participle of dia- 
krino, to separate, to strive with as in Acts 11:2. Dative case 
diabolot. When he disputed (hote dielegeto). Imperfect middle 
of dialegomai as in Mark 9:34. Concerning the body of Moses 
(peri tou Mouseos sdmatos). Some refer this to Zech. 3:1, 
others to a rabbinical comment on Deut. 34:6. There is a 
similar reference to traditions in Acts 7:22; Gal. 3:19; Heb. 
2:2; II Tim. 3:8. But this explanation hardly meets the 
facts. Durst not bring (ouk etolmesen epenegkein). “‘Did not 
dare (first aorist active indicative of to/mao), to bring against 
him” (second aorist active infinitive of epipherd). A railing 
accusation (krisin blasphemias). “Charge of blasphemy” 
where II Pet. 2:11 has “‘dlasphémon krisin.” Peter also has 
para kurioi (with the Lord), not in Jude. The Lord rebuke 
thee (epitimésai soi kurios). First aorist active optative of 
epitimad, a wish about the future. These words occur in 
Zech. 3:1-10 where the angel of the Lord replies to the 
charges of Satan. Clement of Alex. (4dumb. in Ep. Fudae) 
says that Jude quoted here the Assumption of Moses, one 
of the apocryphal books. Origen says the same thing. 
Mayor thinks that the author of the Assumption of Moses 
took these words from Zechariah and put them in the mouth 
of the Archangel Michael. There is a Latin version of the 
Assumption. Some date it as early as B.c. 2, others after 
A.D. 44. 

10. Whatsoever things they know not (hosa ouk oidasin). 
Here II Pet. 2:12 has en hois agnoousin. The rest of the 
sentence is smoother than II Pet. 2:12. Naturally (phusikds). 
Here only in N.T. II Pet. 2:12 has gegennémena phusika. 


THE EPISTLE OF JUDE 191 


Jude has the article ¢a with aloga z0a and the present passive 
phtheirontai instead of the future passive phtharésontai. 

11. Woe to them (ouai autois). Interjection with the dative 
as is common in the Gospels (Matt. 11:21). Went (eporeu- 
thésan). First aorist passive (deponent) indicative of po- 
reuomat. In the way of Cain (téi hodoi tou Kain). Locative 
case hoddi. Cain is Jude’s-fourth example. Not in II Peter, 
but in Heb. 11:4; I John 3:11f. From Gen. 4:7. Ran riot- 
ously (exechuthésan). First aorist passive indicative of ekched, 
to pour out, “‘they were poured out,” vigorous metaphor for 
excessive indulgence. But it is used also of God’s love for 
us (Rom. 5:5). J the error of Balaam (téi planéi tou Balaam). 
The fifth example in Jude. In II Peter also (2:15). Either 
locative case (in) or instrumental (by). Plané (in Peter 
also) is the common word for such wandering (Matt. 24:4ff., 
etc.). Perished (apolonto). Second aorist middle (intransi- 
tive) of apollumi. In the gainsaying of Korah (tei antilogiai 
tou Kore). Again either locative or instrumental. The word 
antilogia is originally answering back (Heb. 6:16), but it 
may be by act also (Rom. 10:21) as here. This is the sixth 
example in Jude, not in II Peter. 

12. Hidden rocks (spilades). Old word for rocks in the 
sea (covered by the water), as in Homer, here only in N.T. 
II Pet. 2:13 has spiloi. Love-feasts (agapais). Undoubtedly 
the correct text here, though A C have apatais as in II Pet. 
2:14. For disorder at the Lord’s Supper (and love-feasts?) 
see I Cor. 11:17-34. The Gnostics made it worse, so that 
the love-feasts were discontinued. When they feast with you 
(suneuochoumenoi). See II Pet. 2:13 for this very word and 
form. Masculine gender with houtoi hoi rather than with 
the feminine spilades. Cf. Rev. 11:4. Construction accord- 
ing to sense. Shepherds that feed themselves (heautous pot- 
mainontes). ‘‘Shepherding themselves.” Cf. Rev. 7:17 for 
this use of poimaind. Clouds without water (nephelai anu- 
droi). Nephelé common word for cloud (Matt. 24:30). I 


192 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Pet. 2:17 has pégai anudroi (springs without water) and then 
homichlai (mists) and elaunomenai (driven) rather than 
peripheromenai here (borne around, whirled around, present 
passive participle of peripherd to bear around), a powerful 
picture of disappointed hopes. Autumn trees (dendra phthino- 
porina). Late adjective (Aristotle, Polybius, Strabo) from 
phthinod, to waste away, and opéra, autumn, here only in 
N.T. For akarpa (without fruit) see II Pet. 1:8. Twice 
dead (dis apothanonta). Second aorist active participle of 
apothnésko. Fruitless and having died. Having died and 
also “uprooted” (ekrizothenta). First aorist passive par- 
ticiple of ekrizod, late compound, to root out, to pluck up 
by the roots, as in Matt. 13:29. 

13. Wild waves (kumata agria). Waves (Matt. 8:24, from 
kued, to swell) wild (from agros, field, wild honey Matt. 
3:4) like untamed animals of the forest or the sea. Foaming 
out (epaphrizonta). Late and rare present active participle 
of epaphrizo, used in Moschus for the foaming waves as 
here. Cf. Is. 57:20. Shame (aischunas). Plural “shames” 
(disgraces). Cf. Phil. 3:19. Wandering stars (asteres plan- 
étai). “Stars wanderers.” Planétés, old word (from planad), 
here alone in N.T. Some refer this to comets or shooting 
stars. See Is. 14:12 for an allusion to Babylon as the day- 
star who fell through pride. For ever (eis aidna). The rest 
of the relative clause exactly as in II Pet. 2:17. 

14. And to these also (de kai toutois). Dative case, for 
these false teachers as well as for his contemporaries. Enoch 
the seventh from Adam (hebdomos apo Adam Henich). The 
genealogical order occurs in Gen. 5:4-20, with Enoch as 
seventh. He is so termed in Enoch 60:8; 93:3. Prophesied 
(eprophéteusen). First aorist active indicative of prophéteud. 
If the word is given its ordinary meaning as in I Pet. 1:10, 
then Jude terms the Book of Enoch an inspired book. The 
words quoted are “‘a combination of passages from Enoch” 
(Bigg), chiefly from Enoch 1:9. With ten thousand of his 


THE EPISTLE OF JUDE 193 


holy ones (en hagiais muriasin autou). “With (en of ac- 
companiment, Luke 14:31) his holy ten thousands” (murias 
regular word, feminine gender, for ten thousand, Acts 19:19, 
there an unlimited number like our myriads, Luke 12:1). 

15. To execute judgment (poiésai krisin). ‘‘To do justice.” 
To convict (elegxai). ‘First aorist (effective) active infinitive 
like poiésai before it. Ungodly (asebeis). See verse 4 and 
end of this verse. Of ungodliness (asebeias). Old word as 
in Rom. 1:18, plural in Jude 18 as in Rom. 11:26. Which 
(hon). Genitive by attraction from ha (cognate accusative 
with @sebésan, old verb, to act impiously, here alone in 
N.T. save some MSS. in II Pet. 2:6) to agree with the ante- 
cedent ergén (deeds). Hard things (skléron). Harsh, rough” 
things as in John 6:60. Which (hon). Genitive by attrac- 
tion from ha (object of e/alésan, first aorist active indicative 
of Jaleo) to the case of the antecedent sk/érén. Four times 
in this verse as a sort of refrain asebeis (twice), asebeias, 
ésebésan. 

16. Murmurers (goggustai). Late onomatopoetic word for 
agent, from gogguzd (Matt. 20:11; I Cor. 10:10) in the LXX 
(Ex. 16:8; Numb. 11:1, 14-29). Complainers (mempsimot- 
roi). Rare word (Isocrates, Aristotle, Plutarch) from mem- 
phomai to complain and moira lot or fate. Here alone in 
N.T. Lusts (epithumias). As in II Pet. 3:3. Swelling 
(huperogka). So in II Pet. 2:18 (big words). Showing re- 
spect of persons (thaumazontes prosopa). Present active par- 
ticiple of thaumazd to admire, to wonder at. Nowhere else 
in N.T. with prosdpa, but a Hebraism (in Lev. 19:15; Job 
13:10) like lambanein prosépon (Luke 20:21) and blepein 
prosipon (Matt. 22:16) and prosopédlempted (James 2:9). Cf. 
James 2:1. For the sake of advantage (opheleias charin). 
To themselves. See also verse 11. The covetousness of these 
Gnostic leaders is plainly shown in II Pet. 2:3, 14. For 
charin as preposition with genitive see Eph. 3:1, 14. 

17. Remember ye (humeis mnésthéte). First aorist passive 


194 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(deponent) imperative of mimnesko with genitive rématon 
(words). In II Pet. 3:2 we have the indirect form (infini- 
tive mnésthénai). The rest as in II Peter, but in simpler and 
more exact structure and with the absence of ton hagion 
prophéton (the holy prophets). 

18. How that (hoti). Declarative hoti as in verse 5. See 
discussion of II Pet. 3:3 for differences, no en empaigmonéi 
here and no ¢6n asebeion there. 

19. They who make separations (hoi apodiorizontes). Pres- 
ent active articular participle of the double compound 
apodiorizo (from apo, dia, horizo, horos, boundary, to make 
a horizon), rare word, in Aristotle for making logical dis- 
tinctions, here only in N.T. Diorizd occurs in Lev. 20:24 
and aphorizo in Matt. 25:32, etc. See Aaireseis in II Pet. 
2:1. Sensual (psuchikoi). Old adjective from psuché as in 
I Cor. 2:14; 15:44; James 3:15. Opposed to pueumatikos. 
Not used by Peter. Having not the Spirit (pneuma mé 
echontes). Usual negative mé with the participle (present 
active of echd). Probably pueuma here means the Holy 
Spirit, as is plain in verse 20. Cf. Rom. 8:9. 

20. Building up (epoikodomountes). Present active par- 
ticiple of epoikodomed, old compound with metaphor of a 
house (oikos), common in Paul (I Cor. 3:9-17; Col. 2:7; 
Eph. 2:20). On your most holy faith (tei hagidtatei humén 
pistei). For the spiritual temple see also I Pet. 2:3-5. See 
pistis (faith) in this sense (cf. Heb. 11:1) in II Pet. 1:5 with 
the list of graces added. A true superlative here hagidtatéi, 
not elative. Praying in the Holy Spirit (en pneumati hagidi 
proseuchomenoi). This is the way to build themselves up 
on iit faith. 

1. Keep yourselves (heautous sirsate): First aorist ac- 
tive ibipeeatins (of urgency) of #éred. In verse 1 they are 
said to be kept, but note the warning in verse 5 from the 
angels who did not keep their dominion. See also James 
1:27. In Phil. 2:12 both sides (human responsibility and 


THE EPISTLE OF JUDE 195 


divine sovereignty are presented side by side). Looking for 
(prosdechomenoi). Present middle participle of prosdecho- 
mai, the very form in Titus 2:13. The same idea in pros- 
dokontes in II Pet. 3:14. ; 

22. And on some (kai hous men). Demonstrative plural 
of hos men—hos de (hous de, below), not the relative hous, 
but by contrast (men, de). So Matt. 13:8. Have mercy 
(eleate). Present active imperative of e/ead (rare form in 
Rom. 9:16 also for the usual e/eed Matt. 9:27). But A C 
read elegchete, refute, in place of eledte. The text of this 
verse is in much confusion. Who are in doubt (diakrino- 
menous). Present middle participle of diakrind, in the ac- 
cusative case agreeing with hous men, though K L P have 
the nominative. If the accusative and eleate is read, see 
James 1:6 for the idea (doubters). If elegchete is read, see 
Jude 9 for the idea (disputers). 

23. And some save (hous de sozete). B omits hous de. 
Snatching them out of the fire (ek puros harpazontes). Present 
active participle of harpazd, old verb, to seize. Quotation 
from Amos 4:11 and Zech. 3:3. Cf. Ps. 106:18. Firemen 
today literally do this rescue work. Do Christians? And~ 
on some have mercy with fear (hous de eleate en phoboi). In 
fear “of the contagion of sin while we are rescuing them” 
(Vincent). For this idea see I Pet. 1:17; 3:15; II Cor. 7:1; 
Phil. 2:12. Spotted (espilomenon). Perfect passive par- 
ticiple of spilod, late and common verb (from spilos, spot, 
II Pet. 2:13), in N.T. only here and James 3:6. 

24. From stumbling (aptaistous). Verbal from ptaid, to 
stumble (James 3:2; II Pet. 1:10), sure-footed as of a 
horse that does not stumble (Xenophon), and so of a good 
man (Epictetus, Marcus Antoninus). Before the presence of 
his glory (katendpion tés doxés autou). Late compound prep- 
osition (kata, en, Ops), right down before the eye of his glory 
as in Eph. 1:4. Cf. Matt. 25:31-33; Col. 1:22, where Paul 
has parastesai like stésai here (first aorist active infinitive) 


196 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


and also amomous as here, but amémétos in II Pet. 3:14. 
In exceeding joy (en agalliasei). See Luke 1:14. 

25. To the only God our Saviour (mondi theoi sotéri hémon). 
Dative in the noble doxology. See Rom. 16:27, mondi 
sophoi thedi (to the alone wise God), where also we have dia 
L@sou Christou, but without tou kuriou hémén (our Lord) 
as here. Sdtér is used of God eight times in the N.T., six 
of them in the Pastoral Epistles. Doxa (glory) to God or 
Christ in all the doxologies except I Tim. 6:16.. Megalosuné 
(Majesty) is a late LXX word, in N.T. only here and Heb. 
1:3; 8:1. Before all time (pro pantos tou aionos). Eternity 
behind us. See same idea in I Cor. 2:7 pro ton aionon. Now 
(nun). The present. For ever more (eis pantas tous aionas). 
“Unto all the ages.” All the future. As complete a state- 
ment of eternity as can be made in human language.

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


RELATION TO THE FourTH GOSPEL 


There are few scholars who deny that the Epistles of John 
and the Fourth Gospel are by the same writer. As a matter 
of fact “in the whole of the First Epistle there is hardly a 
single thought that is not found in the Gospel” (Schulze). 
H. J. Holtzmann (Fahrbuch fur Protestantische Theologie, 
1882, p. 128) in a series of articles on the “Problem of the . 
First Epistle of St. John in its Relation to the Gospel” 
thinks that the similarities are closer than those between 
Luke’s Gospel and the Acts. Baur argued that this fact 
was explained by conscious imitation on the part of one or 
the other, probably by the author of the Epistle. The solu- 
tion lies either in identity of authorship or in imitation. 
If there is identity of authorship, Holtzmann argues that 
the Epistle is earlier, as seems to me to be true, while Brooke 
holds that the Gospel is the earlier and that the First Epis- 
tle represents the more complete ideas of the author. Both 
Holtzmann and Brooke give a detailed comparison of like- 
nesses between the First Epistle and the Fourth Gospel in 
vocabulary, syntax, style, ideas. The arguments are not 
conclusive as to the priority of Epistle or Gospel, but they 
are as to identity of authorship. One who accepts, as I do, 
the Johannine authorship of the Fourth Gospel for the rea- 
sons given in Volume V of this series, does not feel called 
upon to prove the Johannine authorship of the three Epis- 
tles that pass under the Apostle’s name. Westcott suggests 
that one compare John 1:1-18 with I John 1:1-4 to see how 
the same mind deals with the same ideas in different con- 
nections. ‘‘No theory of conscious imitation can reason- 

199

ably explain the subtle coincidences and differences in these 
two short crucial passages.” 


GNOSTICISM 


The Epistle is not a polemic primarily, but a letter for the 
edification of the readers in the truth and the life in Christ. 
And yet the errors of the Gnostics are constantly before 
John’s mind. The leaders had gone out from among the 
true Christians, but there was an atmosphere of sympathy 
that constituted a subtle danger. There are only two pas- 
sages (2:18f.; 4:1-6) in which the false teachers are specifically 
denounced, but “this unethical intellectualism” (Robert 
Law) with its dash of Greek culture and Oriental mysticism 
and licentiousness gave a curious attraction for many who 
did not know how to think clearly. John, like Paul in Co- 
lossians, Ephesians, and the Pastoral Epistles, foresaw this 
dire peril to Christianity. In the second century it gave 
pure Christianity a gigantic struggle. “The great Gnostics 
were the first Christian philosophers” (Robert Law, The 
Tests of Life, p. 27) and threatened to undermine the Gospel 
message by “deifying the devil” (i2., p. 31) along with de- 
throning Christ. There were two kinds of Gnostics, both 
agreeing in the essential evil of matter. Both had trouble 
with the Person of Christ. The Docetic Gnostics denied the 
actual humanity of Christ, the Cerinthian Gnostics distin- 
guished between the man Jesus and the gon Christ that came 
on him at his baptism and left him on the Cross. Some 
practised asceticism, some licentiousness. John opposes both 
classes in his Epistles. They claimed superior knowledge 
(gnosis) and so were called Gnostics (Gndstikoi). Nine times 
John gives tests for knowing the truth and uses the verb 
ginosko (know) each time (2:3, 5; 3:16, 19, 24; 4:2, 6, ry; 
5:2). Some of the leaders he calls antichrists. There are 
stories about John’s dread of Cerinthus and his unwillingness 
to be seen in the same public bath with him. The Apostle 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 201 


of love, as he is, is a real son of thunder when Gnosticism 
shows its head. Westcott thinks that the Fourth Gospel 
was written to prove the deity of Christ, assuming his hu- 
manity, while I John was written to prove the humanity of 
Christ, assuming his deity. Certainly both ideas appear in 
both books.

It is not clear to whom the Epistle is addressed. Like 
the Gospel, the Epistle of John came out of the Asiatic circle 
with Ephesus as the centre. Augustine has the strange 
statement that the Epistle was addressed to the Parthians. 
There are other ingenious conjectures which come to nothing. — 
The Epistle was clearly sent to those familiar with John’s 
message, possibly to the churches of the Province of Asia 
(cf. the Seven Churches in Revelation). 


Tue Date 


The time seems to be considerably removed from the 
atmosphere of the Pauline and Petrine Epistles. Jerusalem 
has been destroyed. If John wrote the Fourth Gospel by 
A.D. 9s, then the First Epistle would come anywhere from 
A.D. 85 to gs. The tone of the author is that of an old man. 
His urgent message that the disciples, his “little children,” 
love one another is like another story about the aged John, 
who, when too feeble to stand, would sit in his chair and 
preach “Little children, love one another.” The Mura- 
torian Fragment accepts the First Epistle and Origen makes 
full use of it, as does Clement of Alexandria. Irenzeus quotes 
it by name. Polycarp shows knowledge of it also.

CHAPTER I 


1. That which (ho). Strictly speaking, the neuter relative 
here is not personal, but the message “‘concerning the Word 
of life” (peri tou logou tes z0@s), a phrase that reminds one 
at once of the Word (Logos) in John 1:1, 14; Rev. 19:14 (an 
incidental argument for identity of authorship for all these 
books). For discussion of the Logos see on John 1:1-18 
(Vol. V). Here the Logos is described by #és 202s (of life), 
while in John 1:4 he is called Aé@ 202 (the Life) as here in 
verse 2 and as Jesus calls himself (John 11:25; 14:6), an ad- 
vance on the phrase here, and in Rev. 19:14 he is termed ho 
logos tou theou (the Word of God), though in John 1:1 the 
Logos is flatly named ho theos (God). John does use 4o in 
a collective personal sense in John 6:37, 39. See also pan 
ho in I John 5:4. From the beginning (ap archés). Anar- 
throus as in John 1:1; 6:64; 16:4. See same phrase in 2:7. 
The reference goes beyond the Christian dispensation, be- 
yond the Incarnation, to the eternal purpose of God in 
Christ (John 3:16), “coeval in some sense with creation” 
(Westcott). That which we have heard (ho akékoamen). Note 
fourfold repetition of ho (that which) without connectives 
(asyndeton). The perfect tense (active indicative of akoud) 
stresses John’s equipment to speak on this subject so slowly 
revealed. It is the literary plural unless John associates the 
elders of Ephesus with himself (Lightfoot) the men who © 
certified the authenticity of the Gospel (John 21:24). That 
which we have seen (ho heorakamen). Perfect active, again, 
of horad, with the same emphasis on the possession of knowl- 
edge by John. With our eyes (tois ophthalmois hémén). In- 
strumental case and showing it was not imagination. on 
John’s part, not an optical illusion as the Docetists claimed, 

204 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 205 


for Jesus had an actual human body. He could be heard 
and seen. That which we beheld (ho etheasametha). Repeti-. 
tion with the aorist middle indicative of theaomai (the very 
form in John 1:14), ‘“‘a spectacle which broke on our aston- 
ished vision” (D. Smith). Handled (epsélaphésan). First 
aorist active indicative of psélaphad, old and graphic verb 
(from psad, to touch), the very verb used by Jesus to prove 
that he was not a mere spirit (Luke 24:39). Three senses 
are here appealed to (hearing, sight, touch) as combining 
to show the reality of Christ’s humanity against the Docetic 
Gnostics and the qualification of John by experience to 
speak. But he is also “the Word of life” and so God 
Incarnate. 

2. Was manifested (ephanerothé). First aorist passive in- 
dicative of phanerod, to make known what already exists, 
whether invisible (B. Weiss) or visible, “intellectual or sensi- 
ble” (Brooke). In Col. 3:4 Paul employs it of the second 
coming of Christ. Verse 2 here is an important parenthesis, 
a mark of John’s style as in John 1:15. By the parenthesis 
John heaps reassurance upon his previous statement of the 
reality of the Incarnation by the use of hedrakamen (as in 
verse I) with the assertion of the validity of his “witness” 
(marturoumen) and “message” (apaggellomen), both present 
active indicatives (literary plurals), apaggel/6 being the pub- 
lic proclamation of the great news (John 16:25). The life, 
the eternal life (ten zoen ten aidnion). Taking up 20é of 
verse 1, John defines the term by the adjective aidnios, used 
71 times in the N.T., 44 times with z0¢ and 23 in John’s 
Gospel and Epistles (only so used in these books by John). 
Here it means the divine life which the Logos was and is 
(John 1:4; I John 1:1). Which (hétis). Qualitative relative, 
“which very life.” Was with the Father (én pros ton patera). 
Not egeneto, but é7, and pros with the accusative of intimate 
fellowship, precisely as in John 1:1 én pros ton theon (was 


206 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


with God). Then John closes the parenthesis by repeating 
ephanerothé. 

3. That which we have seen (ho heorakamen). Third use of 
this form (verses I, 2, 3), this time resumption after the 
parenthesis in verse 2. 4nd heard (kai akékoamen). Second 
(verse 1 for first) use of this form, a third in verse 5. Em- 
phasis by repetition is a thoroughly Johannine trait. De- 
clare we (apaggellomen). Second use of this word (verse 2 
for first), but aggelia (message) and anaggellomen (announce) 
in verse 5. That ye also may have (hina kai humeis echéte). 
Purpose clause with hina and present active subjunctive of 
echo (may keep on having). “‘Ye also” who have not seen 
Jesus in the flesh as well as those like John who have seen 
him. Like kai humin (to you also) just before. Fellowship 
with us (koinonian meth hémon). Common word in this 
Epistle, from koinodnos, partner (Luke 5:10), and koindned, 
to share, in (I Pet. 4:13), with meta emphasising mutual re- 
lationship (Acts 2:42). This Epistle often uses echd with 
a substantive rather than a verb. Yea, and our fellowship 
(kai hé koinonia de hé hémetera). Careful explanation of his 
meaning in the word “‘fellowship” (partnership), involving 
fellowship with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ 
and only possible in Christ. 

4. We write (graphomen hémeis). Literary plural present 
active indicative of graphd, which see in the singular in 
2:12-14. May be fulfilled (¢i pepléromené). Periphrastic — 
perfect passive subjunctive of p/érod, stressing the state of 
completion in the purpose (Aina), remain full, precisely as 
in John 16:24. See aorist subjunctive in John 15:11 and 
perfect indicative in John 17:13. The MSS. differ as often 
between hémon (our) and humén (your). 

5. And (kai). Mutual fellowship depends on mutual 
knowledge (Westcott). Message (aggelia). Old word (from 
aggelos, messenger), in N.T. only here and 3:11, and note 
ap autou (from God like apaggellé in verse 3) and anag- 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 207 


gellomen, to announce, to disclose, here as in John 4:25. 
God is light (ho theos phos estin). Precisely so the Logos is 
light (John 1:4-9) and what Jesus claimed to be (John 
8:12). John repeats it in negative form as he often does 
(John 1:3). 

6. [f we say (ean eipomen). Condition of third class with 
ean and second aorist (ingressive, up and say) active sub- 
junctive. Claiming fellowship with God (see verse 3) in- 
volves walking in the light with God (verse 5) and in the 
darkness (skotos here, but skotia in John 1:5). See 2:11 also 
for en tei skotidi peripated. We lie (pseudometha). Present 
middle indicative, plain Greek and plain English like that _ 
about the devil in John 8:44. Do not the truth (ou poioumen 
ten alétheian). Negative statement of the positive pseu- 
dometha as in John 8:44. See John 3:21 for “doing the 
truth,” like Neh. 9:33. 

7. If we walk (ean peripatimen). Condition of third class 
also with ean and present active subjunctive (keep on walk- 
ing in the light with God). 4s he (ds autos). As God is 
light (verse 5) and dwells in light unapproachable (I Tim. 
6:16). One with another (met’ allelén). As he has already 
said in verse 3. But we cannot have fellowship with one 
another unless we have it with God in Christ, and to do 
that we must walk in the light with God. nd the blood of 
Fesus his Son cleanseth us from all sin (kai to haima Iésou 
tou huiou autou katharizei hemas apo pasés hamartias). This 
clause with kai in true Johannine style is codrdinate with 
the preceding one. Walking in the light with God makes 
possible fellowship with one another and is made possible 
also by the blood of Jesus (real blood and no mere phantom, 
atoning blood of the sinless Son of God for our sins). John 
is not ashamed to use this word. It is not the mere “‘ex- 
ample” of Jesus that “cleanses” us from sin. It does cleanse 
the conscience and life and nothing else does (Heb. 9:13f.; 


208 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Titus 2:14). See in verse 9 both forgiveness and cleansing. 
Cf. I John 3:3. 

8. If we say (ean eipomen). See verse 6. We have no 
sin (hamartian ouk echomen). Yor this phrase see John 
9:41; 15:22, 24. That is, we have no personal guilt, no 
principle of sin. This some of the Gnostics held, since 
matter was evil and the soul was not contaminated by the 
sinful flesh, a thin delusion with which so-called Christian 
scientists delude themselves today. We deceive ourselves 
(heautous planodmen). Present active indicative of planad, 
to lead astray. We do not deceive others who know us. 
Negative statement again of the same idea, “‘the truth is 
not in us.” 

9. If we confess (ean homologomen). Third-class condi- 
tion again with ean and present active subjunctive of homo- 
logeo, “if we keep on confessing.” Confession of sin to God 
and to one another (James 5:16) is urged throughout the 
N.T. from John the Baptist (Mark 1:5) on. Faithful (pistos). 
Jesus made confession of sin necessary to forgiveness. It is 
God’s promise and he is “righteous” (dikaios). To forgive 
(hina aphéi). Sub-final clause with Aina and second aorist 
active subjunctive of aphiémi. And to cleanse (kai hagiaséi). 
So again with hina and the first aorist active subjunctive 
of katharizo (verse 7). 

10. If we say (ean eipomen). As in verses 6, 8. We have 
not sinned (ouch hamartékamen). Perfect active indicative 
of hamartano. This is a denial of any specific acts of sin, — 
while in verse 8 we have the denial of the principle of sin. 
David Smith observes that the claim to personal perfec- 
tionism has two causes, one the stifling of conscience in 
making God a liar (pseustén, the word used of the devil by 
Jesus in John 8:44), and the other ignorance of God’s word, 
which is not in us, else we should not make such a claim. 


CHAPTER II 


1. My little children (teknia mou). ‘Tender tone with this 
diminutive of seknon (child), again in 2:12 and 3:18, but 
paidia in 2:14. John is now an old man and regards his 
readers as his little children. That attitude is illustrated 
in the story of his visit to the robber to win him to Christ. 
That ye may not sin (hina mé hamartéte). Purpose (negative) 
clause with hina mé and the second aorist (ingressive, com. 
mit sin) active subjunctive of hamartand, to sin. John has 
no patience with professional perfectionists (1:8-10), but he 
has still less with loose-livers like some of the Gnostics who © 
went to all sorts of excesses without shame. Jf any man sin 
(ean tis hamartéi). ‘Third-class condition with ean and second 
aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive again, “‘if one com- 
mit sin.” We have (echomen). Present active indicative of 
echo in the apodosis, a present reality like echomen in II 
Cor. 5:1. 4n advocate (parakléton). See on John 14:16, 26; 
15:26; 16:7 for this word, nowhere else in the N.T. The 
Holy Spirit is God’s Advocate on earth with men, while 
Christ is man’s Advocate with the Father (the idea, but 
not the word, in Rom. 8:31-39; Heb. 7:25). As dikaios 
(righteous) Jesus is qualified to plead our case and to enter 
the Father’s presence (Heb. 2:18). 

2. And he (kai autos). He himself in his own person, both 
priest and sacrifice (Heb. 9:14). The propitiation (hilasmos). 
Late substantive from hilaskomai (Luke 18:13; Heb. 2:17), 
in LXX, Philo, Plutarch, in N.T. only here and 4:10. 
Christ himself is the means of propitiation for (peri con- 
cerning) our sins. See Ailastérion in Rom. 3:25. For the 
whole world (peri holou tou kosmou). It is possible to supply 
the ellipsis here of td hamartion (the sins of) as we have it 

209 


210 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


in Heb. 7:27, but a simpler way is just to regard “the whole 
world” as a mass of sin (5:19). At any rate, the propitia- 
tion by Christ provides for salvation for all (Heb. 2:9) if 
they will only be reconciled with God (II Cor. 5:19-21). 

3. Hereby (en toutdi). See this phrase also in 2:5; 3:16, 19, 
243 4:2, 13; §:2. That is explained by the ean clause, “‘if we 
keep his commandments” (ean térdmen, condition of the 
third class, ean with present active subjunctive, “if we keep 
on keeping”), the clause itself in apposition with toutdi (loca- 
tive case). Know we that we know him (ginoskomen hoti egno- 
kamen auton). “‘Know we that we have come to know and 
still know him,” egndkamen the perfect active indicative of 
gindskd. The Gnostics boasted of their superior knowledge 
of Christ, and John here challenges their boast by an appeal 
to experimental knowledge of Christ which is shown by 
keeping his (autou, Christ’s) commandments, thoroughly 
Johannine phrase (12 times in the Gospel, 6 in this Epistle, 
6 in the Apocalypse). 

4. I know him (Egnoka auton). Perfect active indicative 
with recitative oti like quotation marks just before it. This 
is one of the pious platitudes, cheap claptrap of the Gnostics, 
who would bob up in meetings with such explosions. John 
punctures such bubbles with the sharp addition “and keep- 
eth not” (ho mé téron, present active linear participle). 
“The one who keeps on saying: ‘I have come to know hin,’ 
and keeps on not keeping his commandments is a liar” 
(pseustés, just like Satan, John 8:44 and like I John 1:8, 10), | 
followed by the negative statement as in 1:8 and 10. There 
is a whip-cracker effect in John’s words. 

5. But whoso keepeth (hos d’ an teréi). Indefinite relative 
clause with modal an and the present active subjunctive, 
“whoever keeps on keeping.” Verily (aléthos). Truly, of a 
truth. This prize is open to all, not confined to a few initi- 
ated Gnostic intellectuals or pneumatics. Hath the love of 
God been perfected (hé agapé tou theou teteleidtai). Perfect 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN ant 


passive indicative of teleiod, stands completed. Probably 
objective genitive, our love for God, which is realized in 
absolute obedience (Brooke). Hereby (en toutoi). That is 
by continuous keeping of Christ’s commandments, not by 
loud talk and loose living. 

6. Himself also to walk (kai autos peripatein). Present 
active infinitive after opheilei (ought), ‘“Himself also to keep 
on walking,” a continuous performance, not a spasmodic 
spurt. Even as he walked (kathos ekeinos periepatesen). Con- 
stative aorist active indicative summing up the life of Christ 
on earth with the emphatic use of the demonstrative ekeinos 
in reference to Christ as in 3:3, 5, 7, 16; 4:17 and John 7:11; 
GePay 28 3e19s21. 

+. Beloved (agapétoi). First instance of this favourite 
form of address in these Epistles (3:2, 21; 4:1, 7; III John 
I, 2, 5, 11). No new commandment (ouk entolén kainén). 
Not novel or new in kind (kainén as distinct from neos, new 
in time, for which distinction see Luke 5:33-38). But an 
old commandment (all’ entolén palaian). Ancient as opposed 
both to kainos and neos. The Mosaic law taught love for 
one’s neighbours and Christ taught love even of enemies. 
Which ye had (hén eichete). Imperfect active, reaching back 
to the beginning of their Christian lives (ap’ archés). They 
had heard it expressly from Jesus (John 13:34), who, how- 
ever, calls it ‘a new commandment.” 

8. Again a new commandment (palin entolén kainén). 
Paradox, but truth. Old in teaching (as old as the story of 
Cain and Abel, 3:11f.), but new in practice. For this use 
of palin for a new turn see John 16:28. To walk as Christ 
walked is to put in practice the old commandment and so 
make it new (ever new and fresh), as love is as old as man 
and fresh in every new experience. True in him and in you 
(aléthes en autoi kai en humin). This newness is shown 
supremely in Christ and in disciples when they walk as Jesus 
did (verse 6). Because (hoti). Explanation of the paradox. 


212 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Is passing away (paragetai). Present middle indicative of 
parago, old verb, to lead by, to go by (intransitive), as in 
Matt. 20:30. Night does pass by even if slowly. See this 
verb in verse 17 of the world passing by like a procession. 
True (aléthinon). Genuine, reliable, no false flicker. 4/- 
ready shineth (édé phainei). Linear present active, “‘is al- 
ready shining” and the darkness is already passing by. 
Dawn is here. Is John thinking of the second coming of 
Christ or of the victory of truth over error, of light over 
darkness (cf. John 1:5-9), the slow but sure victory of 
Christ over Satan as shown in the Apocalypse? See 1:5. 

9. And hateth his brother (kai ton adelphon autou mison). 
Sharp contrast between the love just described and hate. 
The only way to walk in the light (1:7) is to have fellowship 
with God who is light (1:3, 5). So the claim to be in the 
light is nullified by hating a brother. Even until now (hes 
arti). Up till this moment. In spite of the increasing light 
and his own boast he is in the dark. 

10. Abideth (menei). Present active indicative, continues 
in the light and so does not interrupt the light by hating 
his brother. Occasion of stumbling (skandalon). See on 
Matt. 13:41; 16:23 for this interesting word. It is a stum- 
bling-block or trap either in the way of others (its usual 
sense), as in Matt. 18:7, or in one’s own way, as is true of 
proskopto in John 11:9 and in verse 11 here. But, as West- 
cott argues, John may very well have the usual meaning here 
and the other in verse 11. . 

11. Blinded (etuphlosen). First aorist active indicative of 
tuphloo, the very verb and form used in II Cor. 4:4 of the 
god of this age to keep men from beholding the illumina- 
tion of the gospel of the glory of Christ who is tne image of 
God. The first part of the verse repeats verse 9, but adds 
this vivid touch of the blinding power of darkness. In the 
Mammoth Cave of Kentucky the fish in Echo River have 
eye-sockets, but no eyes. 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 213 


12. I write (grapho). Present active indicative, repeated 
three times, referring to this Epistle. For “the name” see 
3:23 and III John 7. They were loyal to the name of Christ 
(Matt. 10:22). Are forgiven (aphedntai). Doric perfect pas- 
sive indicative of aphiémi (seen also in Luke 5:20, 23) for 
the usual apheintai. \ Teknia (little children) probably in- 
cludes all, as in verse 1. 

13. Fathers (pateres). Those mature believers with long 
and rich experience (egndkate, ye have come to know and 
still know). Him which is from the beginning (ton ap’ archés). 
See 1:1 as explaining this crisp description of the Word of 
life (cf. John 1:1-18). Young men (neaniskoi). The younger 
element in contrast to the fathers, full of vigor and conflict — 
and victory. Ye have overcome the evil one (nenikékate ton 
ponéron). Perfect active indicative of nikad, a permanent 
victory after conflict. The masculine article ton shows that 
the prince of darkness is the one defeated in this struggle, 
the devil plain in 3:8, 10 (John 8:44; 13:2). 

14. I have written (egrapsa). Repeated three times. Epis- 
tolary aorist referring to this Epistle, not to a previous 
Epistle. Law (Tests of Life, p. 309) suggests that John was 
interrupted at the close of verse 13 and resumes here in 
verse 14 with a reference to what he had previously written 
in verse 13. But that is needless ingenuity. It is quite in 
John’s style to repeat himself with slight variations. The 
Father (ton patera). ‘The heavenly Father as all of God’s 
children should come to know him. He repeats from verse 
13 what he said to “fathers.” To the young men he adds 
ischuroi (strong) and the word of God abiding in them. 
That is what makes them powerful (ischuroi) and able to 
gain the victory over the evil one. 

15. Love not the world (mé agapate ton kosmon). Prohibi- 
tion with mé and the present active imperative of agapad, 
either stop doing it or do not have the habit of doing it. 
This use of kosmos is common in John’s Gospel (1:10; 


214 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


17:14ff.) and appears also in I John 5:19. In epitome the 
Roman Empire represented it. See it also in James 4:4. 
It confronts every believer today. Jf any man love (ean tis 
agapai). ‘Third-class condition with ean and present active 
subjunctive of agapad (same form as indicative), “if any 
keep on loving the world.” The love of the Father (hé agapé 
tou patros). Objective genitive, this phrase only here in 
N.T., with which compare “love of God” in 2:5. In an- 
tithesis to love of the world. 

16. All that (pan to). Collective use of the neuter singular 
as in §:4, like pan ho in John 6:37, 39. Three examples, not 
necessarily covering all sins, are given in the nominative in 
apposition with paz to. “The lust of the flesh” (hé epi- 
thumia tés sarkos, subjective genitive, lust felt by the flesh) 
may be illustrated by Mark 4:19 and Gal. 5:17. So the 
genitive with hé epithumia tin ophthalmon (the lust of the 
eyes) is subjective, lust with the eyes as organs as shown 
by Jesus in Matt. 5:28. The use of the “movies” today 
for gain by lustful exhibitions is a case in point. For ala- 
zoneia see on James 4:16, the only other N.T. example. 
Alazon (a boaster) occurs in Rom. 1:30; II Tim. 3:2. Bios 
(life) as in 3:17 is the external aspect (Luke 8:14), not the 
inward principle (zd@). David Smith thinks that, as in the 
case of Eve (Gen. 3:1-6) and the temptations of Jesus (Matt. 
4:I-11), these three sins include all possible sins. But they 
are all “‘of the world” (ek tou kosmou) in origin, in no sense | 
“of the Father” (ek tou patros). The problem for the be- 
liever is always how to be in the world and yet not of it 
(John 17:11, 14ff.). 

17. Passeth away (paragetai). “Is passing by” (linear 
action, present middle indicative), as in verse 8. There is 
consolation in this view of the transitoriness of the conflict 
with the world. Even the lust which belongs to the world 
passes also. The one who keeps on doing (poidn present 
active participle of poied) the will of God “abides for ever” 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 215 


(menei eis ton aidna) “amid the flux of transitory things” 
(D. Smith). 

18. It is the last hour (eschaté hora estin). This phrase 
only here in N.T., though John often uses Aéra for a crisis 
(John 2:4; 4:21, 23; 5:25, 28, etc.). It is anarthrous here 
and marks the character of the “hour.” John has seven 
times “the last day” in the Gospel. Certainly in verse 28 
John makes it plain that the parousia might come in the 
life of those then living, but it is not clear that here he 
definitely asserts it as a fact. It was his hope beyond a 
doubt. We are left in doubt about this ‘“‘last hour” whether 
it covers a period, a series, or the final climax of all just at 
hand. As ye heard (kathés ékousate). First aorist active 
indicative of akoud. Antichrist cometh (antichristos erchetat). 
“Ts coming.” Present futuristic or prophetic middle indica- 
tive retained in indirect assertion. So Jesus taught (Mark 
13:6, 22; Matt. 24:5, 15, 24) and so Paul taught (Acts 20:30; 
II Thess. 2:3). These false Christs (Matt. 24:24; Mark 
13:22) are necessarily antichrists, for there can be only one. 
Anti can mean substitution or opposition, but both ideas 
are identical in the word antichristos (in N.T. only here, 
2:22; 4:3; 11 John 7). Westcott rightly observes that John’s 
use of the word is determined by the Christian conception, 
not by the Jewish apocalypses. Have there arisen (gegonasin). 
Second perfect active indicative of ginomai. Many anti- 
christs (antichristoi polloi). Not just one, but the exponents 
of the Gnostic teaching are really antichrists, just as some 
modern deceivers deserve this title. Whereby (hothen). By 
the fact that these many antichrists have come. 

19. From us (ex hémon)—of us (ex hémon). The same 
idiom, ex and the ablative case (h@mon), but in different 
senses to correspond with exé/than (they went out from our 
membership) and owk ésan (they were not of us in spirit and 
life). For ex in the sense of origin see John 17:15, for ex in 
the sense of likeness, John 17:14. For if they had been of us 


216 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(ei gar ex hémon ésan). Condition of second class with ef 
and imperfect tense (no aorist for eimi). They would have 
continued (memenékeisan an). Past perfect of mend, to re- 
main, without augment, with am in apodosis of second-class 
condition. With us (meth hémon). In fellowship, for which 
see meta in 1:3. They had lost the inner fellowship and then 
apparently voluntarily broke the outward. But they went 
(all’). Ellipsis of the verb exélthan above, a common habit 
(ellipse) in John’s Gospel (1:8; 9:3; 13:18; 15:25). That 
they might be made manifest (hina phanerothosin). Purpose 
clause with Aina and the first aorist passive subjunctive of 
phaneroo, for which verb see John 21:1; Col. 3:4. See II 
Cor. 3:3 for the personal construction with Aofi as here. 
They all are not (ouk eisin pantes). Not just some, but all, 
as in 2:21; 3:5. These antichrists are thus revealed in their 
true light. 

20. Anointing (chrisma). Old word for result (mat) and 
for the material, from chrid, to anoint, perhaps suggested 
by the use of antichristoi in verse 18. Christians are 
“anointed ones,” christoi in this sense, with which compare 
Ps. 105:15:‘‘ Touch not my anointed ones” (mé hapsésthe ton 
christon mou). These antichrists posed as the equals of or 
even superior to Christ himself. But followers of Christ do 
have “‘the oil of anointing” (to elaion tou chrismatos, Ex. 
29:7), the Holy Spirit. This word in the N.T. only here 
and verse 27. Later the term was applied to baptism after 
baptismal remission came to be taught (Tertullian, etc.). 
From the Holy One (apo tou hagiou). They receive this 
anointing of the Holy Spirit from the Anointed One, Jesus 
Christ (the Holy One). Cf. John 6:69; Acts 3:14. And ye 
know all things (kai oidate panta). But the best MSS. read 
pantes rather than panta, “Ye all know it.” This anointing 
is open to all Christians, not just a select few. 

21. L have not written (ouk egrapsa). Not epistolary aorist 
(2:14), but a reference to what he has just said. And be- 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN oi7 


cause no lie is of the truth (kai hoti pan pseudos ek tés aletheias 
ouk estin). Not certain whether oti here is causal (be- 
cause) or declarative (that). Either makes sense. Note 
the idiomatic use of ek and pan—ouk=ouden (no) as in 
verse Ig. 

22. The liar (ho pseustés). The liar (with the article) 
par excellence. Rhetorical question to sharpen the point 
made already about lying in 1:6, 10; 2:4, 21. See 5:5 for 
a like rhetorical question. But (ei mé). Except, if not. 
That denieth that Fesus is the Christ (ho arnoumenos hoti 
Tésous ouk estin ho Christos). Common Greek idiom for 
ouk to appear after arneomai like redundant mé in Luke © 
20:27 and Heb. 12:19. The old Latin retains zon here as 
old English did (Shakespeare, Comedy of Errors IV. ii. 7, 
“He denied you had in him no right”). The Cerinthian 
Gnostics denied the identity of the man Jesus and Christ 
(an gon, they held) like the modern Jesus or Christ con- 
troversy. This is the antichrist (houtos estin ho antichristos). 
The one just mentioned, Cerinthus himself in particular. 
Even he that denieth the Father and the Son ( ho arnoumenos 
ton patera kai ton huion). This is the inevitable logic of 
such a rejection of the Son of God. Jesus had himself said 
this very same thing (John 5:23f.). 

23. Hath not the Father (oude ton patera echei). “Not 
even does he have the Father” or God (II John 9). He 
that confesseth the Son (ho homologon ton huion). Because 
the Son reveals the Father (John 1:18; 14:9). Our only 
approach to the Father is by the Son (John 14:6). Confes- 
sion of Christ before men is a prerequisite for confession 
by Christ before the Father (Matt. 10:32 =Luke 12:8). 

24. As for you (humeis). Emphatic proleptic position be- 
fore the relative ho and subject of @kousate, a familiar idiom 
in John 8:45; 10:29, etc. Here for emphatic contrast with 
the antichrists. See 1:1 for ap’ archés (from the beginning). 
Let abide in you (en humin meneto). Present active impera- 


218 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


tive of mend, to remain. Do not be carried away by the 
new-fangled Gnostic teaching. 

25. And this is the promise (kai hauté estin hé epaggelia). 
See 1:5 for the same idiom with agge/lia (message). This is 
the only instance of epaggelia in the Johannine writings. 
Here “‘the promise” is explained to be “the life eternal” 
(1:2). In Acts 1:4 the word is used for the coming of the 
Holy Spirit. He promised (autos epéggeilato). First aorist 
middle indicative of epaggelld. Autos (he) is Christ as is 
seen in 3:3 by ekeinos. 

26. Concerning them that would lead you astray (peri ton 
planontin humas). “Concerning those that are trying to 
lead you astray” (conative use of the present active artic- 
ular participle of planad. See 1:8 for this verb. John is 
doing his part to rescue the sheep from the wolves, as Paul 
did (Acts 20:29). 

27. And as for you (kai humeis). Prolepsis again as in 
verse 24. Which ye received of him (ho elabete ap’ autou). 
Second aorist active indicative of /amband, a definite ex- 
perience, this anointing (chrisma), from Christ himself as 
in verse 20. This Paraclete was promised by Christ (John 
14:26; 16:13ff.) and came on the great Pentecost, as they 
knew, and in the experience of all who yielded themselves 
to the Holy Spirit. That any one teach you (hina tis didaskét 
humas). Sub-final use of hina and the present active sub- 
junctive of didasko, “that any one keep on teaching you.” 
Teacheth you (didaskei humas). Present active indicative. 
The Holy Spirit was to bring all things to their remembrance 
(John 14:26) and to bear witness concerning Christ (John 
15:26; 16:12-15). Yet they need to be reminded of what 
they already know to be “true” (a/éthes) and “no lie” 
(ouk estin pseudos), according to John’s habit of positive 
and negative (1:5). So he exhorts them to “abide in him” 
(menete en autoi, imperative active, though same form as 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 219 


the indicative). Precisely so Jesus had urged that the 
disciples abide in him (John 15:4f.). 

28. dnd now (kai nun). John tenderly repeats the ex- 
hortation, “keep on abiding in him.” Jf he shall be man- 
ifested (ean phanerothéi). Condition of third class with ean 
and first aorist passive subjunctive as in verse 19 and Col. 
3:3. A clear reference to the second coming of Christ which 
may be at any time. That we have boldness (hina schimen 
parrésian). Purpose clause with hina and the ingressive 
second aorist active subjunctive of echd, “that we may get 
boldness.” And not be ashamed (kai mé aischunthimen). 
Likewise negative purpose (after John’s fashion) with mé 
and the first aorist passive subjunctive of aischund, to put 
to shame. Before him (ap’ autou). “From him,” as if 
shrinking away from Christ in guilty surprise. See II Thess. 
1:9 for this use of apo (from the face of the Lord). 

29. If ye know (ean eidéte). Third-class condition again 
with ean and second perfect active subjunctive of oida. If 
ye know by intuitive or absolute knowledge that Christ 
(because of verse 28) is righteous, then “‘ye know” or “know 
ye” (gindskete either indicative or imperative) by experi- 
mental knowledge (so gindskd means in contrast with vida). 
Is begotten (gegennétai). Perfect passive indicative of gennad, 
stands begotten, the second birth (regeneration) of John 
3:3-8. Of him (ex autou). Plainly “of God” in verse 9 and 
so apparently here in spite of dikaios referring to Christ. 
Doing righteousness is proof of the new birth. 


CHAPTER ‘ITI 


1. What manner of love (potapen agapén). Qualitative 
interrogative as in II Pet. 3:11; Matt. 8:27. Only here in 
John’s writings. Originally of what country or race. Hath 
bestowed (dedoken). Perfect active indicative of didémi, state 
of completion, “the endowment of the receiver” (Vincent). 
That we should be called (hina klethomen). Sub-final use of 
hina with the first aorist passive subjunctive of ka/eé, to call 
or name, asin Matt. 2:23. Children (tekna). Asin John 1:12 
and with an allusion to gegennétai in 2:29 in an effort “to 
restore the waning enthusiasm of his readers, and to recall 
them to their first love” (Brooke). And such we are (kai 
esmen). “And we are.” A parenthetical reflection char- 
acteristic of John (kai nun estin in John 5:25 and kai ouk 
eisin in Rev. 2:2; 3:9) omitted by Textus Receptus, though, 
in the old MSS. Because it knew him not (hoti ouk egno 
auton). Second aorist active indicative of gindskd, precisely 
the argument in John 15:18f. 

2. Now (nun). Without waiting for the parousia or 
second coming. We havea present dignity and duty, though 
there is greater glory to come. J¢ is not yet made manifest 
(oupo ephanerothe). First aorist passive indicative of phan- 
erod. For the aorist indicative with oupd with a future 
outlook Brooke notes Mark 11:2; I Cor. 8:2; Heb. 12:4; 
Rev. 17:10, 12. What we shall be (ti esometha). Not tines 
(who), but #2 (what) neuter singular predicate nominative. 
“This what suggests something unspeakable, contained in 
the likeness of God” (Bengel). Jf he shall be manifested 
(ean phanerothéi). As in 2:28, which see. The subject 
may be Christ as in verse g, or the future manifestation 
just mentioned. Either makes sense, probably ‘‘it” here 

220 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 221 


better than “he.” Like him (homoioi autéi). Autii is as- 
sociative instrumental case after homoioi. This is our des- 
tiny and glory (Rom. 8:29), to be like Jesus who is like 
God (II Cor. 4:6). We shall see him even as he is (opsometha 
auton kathos estin). Future middle indicative of horad. The 
transforming power of this vision of Christ (I Cor. 13:12) 
is the consummation of the glorious process begun at the 
new birth (II Cor. 3:18). 

3. Set on him (ep’ autdi). Resting upon (epi) with loca- 
tive rather than eis, looking to, Acts 24:15. That is upon 
Christ (Brooke), upon God (D. Smith), upon God in Christ 
(Westcott). Purifieth himself (hagnizei heauton). Present 
active indicative of hagnizd, old verb, from hagnos (pure 
from contamination), used of ceremonial purifications (John 
11:55; Acts 21:24, 26 as in Ex. 19:10) and then of personal 
internal cleansing of heart (James 4:8), soul (I Pet. 1:22), 
self (here). Cf. Phil. 2:12f. the work of both God and 
man. As he is pure (kathos ekeinos hagnos estin). As in 
2:6 and 3:9 ekeinos (emphatic demonstrative) refers to 
Christ. Christ can be termed hagnos “in virtue of the per- 
fection of his humanity” (Westcott). Our destiny is to be 
conformed to the image of God in Christ (Rom. 8:29). 

4. Sin is lawlessness (hé hamartia estin hé anomia). ‘The 
article with both subject and predicate makes them co- 
extensive and so interchangeable. Doing sin is the con- 
verse of doing righteousness (2:29). The present active par- 
ticiple (poidn) means the habit of doing sin. 

5. He (ekeinos). As in verse 3 and John 1:18. Was 
manifested (ephanerothé). Same form as in verse 2, but 
here of the Incarnation as in John 21:1, not of the second 
coming (I John 2:28). To take away sins (hina tas hamartias 
aréi). Purpose clause with hina and first aorist active sub- 
junctive of aird as in John 1:29. In Is. 53:11 we have 
anaphero for bearing sins, but gird properly means to lift 
up and carry away (John 2:16). So in Heb. 10:4 we find 


222 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


aphaired and Heb. 10:11 periaired, to take away sins com- 
pletely (the complete expiation wrought by Christ on Cal- 
vary). The plural Aamartias here, as in Col. 1:14, not 
singular (collective sense) hamartian as in John 1:29. And 
in him is no sin (kai hamartia en autoi ouk estin). ““And 
sin (the sinful principle) in him is not.” As Jesus had claimed 
about himself (John 7:18; 8:46) and as is repeatedly stated 
in'the N.T.. (II Cor) ¢:27sHeb. 4:19 j.-penGyiget 9) 

6. Sinneth not (ouch hamartanei). Linear present (linear 
menon, keeps on abiding) active indicative of hamartand, 
“‘does not keep on sinning.” For mend (abide) see 2:6 and 
John 15:4-10. Whosoever sinneth (ho hamartanin). Present 
(linear) active articular participle like mendn above, “the 
one who keeps on sinning” (lives a life of sin, not mere 
occasional acts of sin as hamartésas, aorist active participle, 
would mean). Hath not seen him (ouch heoraken auton). 
Perfect active indicative of horad. The habit of sin is proof 
that one has not the vision or the knowledge (egndken, 
perfect active also) of Christ. He means, of course, spiritual 
vision and spiritual knowledge, not the literal sense of 
horad in John 1:18; 20:29. 

7. Let no man lead you astray (médeis planatd humas). 
Present active imperative of planad, “let no one keep on 
leading you astray.” See 1:8 and 2:26. Break the spell 
of any Gnostic charmer. He that doeth righteousness (ho 
potion ten dikaiosunén). “‘He that keeps on doing (present 
active participle of poied) righteousness.” For this idiom 
with poied see 1:6; 3:4. He (ekeinos). Christ as in verse 5. 

8. He that doeth sin (ho potion ten hamartian). ‘‘He that 
keeps on doing sin” (the habit of sin). Of the devil (ek tou 
diabolou). In spiritual parentage as Jesus said of the Phar- 
isees in John 8:44. When one acts like the devil he shows 
that he is not a true child of God. Sinneth from the begin- 
ning (ap’ archés hamartanei). Linear progressive present 
active indicative, “he has been sinning from the beginning” 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 223 


of his career as the devil. This is his normal life and those 
who imitate him become his spiritual children. That he 
might destroy (hina luséi). Purpose clause with Aina and 
the first aorist active subjunctive of Jud. This purpose (eis 
touto) Jesus had and has. There is eternal conflict, with 
final victory over Satan certain. 

9. Doeth no sin (hamartian ou poiei). Linear present ac- 
tive indicative as in verse 4 like hamartanei in verse 8. 
The child of God does not have the habit of sin. His seed 
(sperma autou). God’s seed, “the divine principle of life” 
(Vincent). Cf. John 1. And he cannot sin (kai ou dunatai 
hamarianein). This is a wrong translation, for this English 
naturally means “‘and he cannot commit sin”’ as if it were 
kai ou dunatai hamartein or hamartésai (second aorist or 
first aorist active infinitive). The present active infinitive 
hamartanein can only mean “‘and he cannot go on sinning,” 
as is true of hamartanei in verse 8 and hamartanon in verse 6. 
For the aorist subjunctive to commit a sin see hamartéte 
and hamartéi in 2:1. A great deal of false theology has 
grown out of a misunderstanding of the tense of hamar- 
tanein here. Paul has precisely John’s idea in Rom. 6:1 
epimenomen téi hamartiai (shall we continue in sin, present 
active linear subjunctive) in contrast with hamartésdmen in 
Rom. 6:15 (shall we commit a sin, first aorist active sub- 
junctive). 

10. In this (en toutoi). As already shown. A life of sin 
is proof that one is a child of the devil and not of God. 
This is the line of cleavage that is obvious to all. See John 
8:33-39 for the claim of the Pharisees to be the children of 
Abraham, whereas their conduct showed them to be children 
of the devil. This is not a popular note with an age that 
wishes to remove all distinctions between Christians and 
the world. Doeth not righteousness (ho mé poion dikaiosunén). 
Habit (linear present participle) again of not doing right- 
eousness, as in verse 7 of doing it. Cf. poiei and mé poidn 


224 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(doing and not doing) in Matt. 7:24, 26. Neither (kai). 
Literally, “and,” but with the ellipsis of ouk estin ek tou 
theou (is not of God). The addition here of this one item 
about not loving (mé agapon) one’s brother is like Paul’s 
summary in Rom. 13:9, a striking illustration of the general 
principle just laid down and in accord with 2:9-11. 

11. Message (aggelia). In N.T. only here and 1:5, but 
epaggelia (promise) fifty-one times. From the beginning (ap’ 
archés). See 1:1 for this phrase and 2:7 for the idea. They 
had the message of love for the brotherhood from the be- 
ginning of the gospel and it goes back to the time of Cain 
and Abel (verse 12). That we should love one another (hina 
agapomen allélous). Sub-final clause (content of the agge/ia) 
with Aina and present active subjunctive. John repeats the 
message of 2:7f. 

12. Of the evil one (ek tou ponérou). Ablative case and the 
same for neuter and masculine singular, but verse 10 makes 
it clear that the reference is to the devil. Slew (esphaxen). 
First aorist active indicative of sphazd, old verb, to slay, 
to butcher, to cut the throat (Latin jugu/are) like an ox in 
the shambles, in N.T. only here and Rev. (5:6, 9, 12, etc.). 
Wherefore? (charin tinos;). “For the sake of what?” Post- 
positive preposition (Eph. 3:1, 14) except here. The inter- 
pretation of the act of Cain (Gen. 4:8ff.) is an addition to 
the narrative, but in accord with Heb. 11:4. Jealousy led 
to murder. | 

13. If (ei). Common construction after thaumazd (won- 
der) rather than Aoti (that, because). Present imperative 
here with mé means “cease wondering.” Note mé thau- 
maséis (do not begin to wonder) in John 3:6 (an individual 
case). See this same condition and language in John 15:18. 

14. We know (hémeis oidamen). Emphatic expression. of 
hémeis (we) in contrast to the unregenerate world, the 
Christian consciousness shared by writer and readers. We 
have passed (metabebékamen). Perfect active indicative of 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 225 


metabaind, old compound to pass over from one place to 
another (John 7:3), to migrate, out of death into life. We 
have already done it while here on earth. Because (hoti). 
Proof of this transition, not the ground of it. We love the 
brethren (agapomen tous adelphous). Just this phrase (plural) 
here alone, but see 2:9 for the singular. He that loveth not 
(ho mé agapon). “The not loving man,” general picture and 
picture of spiritual death. 

15. 4 murderer (anthropoktonos).. Old compound (Eu- 
ripides) from anthropos (man) and kteind (to kill), a man- 
killer, in N.T. only here and John 8:44 (of Satan). No 
(pads—ou). According to current Hebraistic idiom =oudeis 
as in 2:19, 21. Abiding (menousan). Present active fem-~ 
inine accusative predicate participle of mend, ‘“‘a continuous 
power and a communicated gift” (Westcott). 

16. Know we (egnokamen). Perfect active indicative, “we 
have come to know and still know.” See 2:3 for “hereby” 
(en toutoi). Love (tén agapén). ‘The thing called love” 
(D. Smith). He for us (ekeinos huper hémon). Ekeinos as 
in 2:6; 3:3, 5, Auper here alone in this Epistle, though com- 
mon in John’s Gospel (10:11, 15; 11:50, etc.) and in III 
John 7. Laid down his life (tén psuchén autou ethéken). 
First aorist active indicative of tithémi, the very idiom used 
by Jesus of himself in John 10:11, 17f. We ought (hémeis 
opheilomen). Emphatic hémeis again. For opheilé see 2:6. 
Of course our laying down our lives for the brethren has 
no atoning value in our cases as in that of Christ, but is a 
supreme ‘proof of one’s love (John 13:37f.; 15:13), as often 
happens. 

17. Whoso hath (hos an echéi). Indefinite relative clause 
with modal an with hos and the present: active subjunctive 
of echd. The world’s goods (ton bion tou kosmou). ‘“The 
living or livelihood (not 262, the principle of life, and see 
2:16 for bios) of the world” (not in the sense of evil or 
wicked, but simply this mundane sphere). Beholdeth (the- 


226 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


drei). Present active subjunctive of thedred, like echei just 
before. In need (chreian echonta). ‘Having need” (present 
active predicate participle of echd, agreeing with adelphon). 
See the vivid picture of a like case in James 2:15f. Shutteth 
up (kleiséi). First aorist (effective) active subjunctive of 
kleid, to close like the door, changed on purpose from present 
tense to aorist (graphic slamming the door of his compas- 
sion, splagchna, common in LXX and N.T. for the nobler 
viscera, the seat of the emotions, as in Phil. 2:11; Col. 3:12). 
Only here in John. How (pds). Rhetorical question like 
that in James 2:16 (what is the use?). It is practical, not 
speculative, that counts in the hour of need. 

18. In word, neither with the tongue (logoi méde téi glossé). 
Either instrumental or locative makes sense. What John 
means is “not merely by word or by the tongue.” He does 
not condemn kind words which are comforting and cheer- 
ing, but warm words should be accompanied by warm deeds 
to make real “in deed and in truth” (en ergdi kai alétheiat). 
Here is a case where actions do speak louder than mere 
words. 

19. Shall we know (gndsometha). Future middle indica- 
tive of gindsko, at any future emergency, we shall come to 
know by this (ez toutoi) “that we are of the truth” (Aoti ek 
tés alétheias esmen). Before him (emprosthen autou). In the 
very presence of God we shall have confident assurance 
(peisomen ten kardian hémon, either we shall persuade our 
heart or shall assure our heart) because God understands us. 

20. Whereinsoever our heart condemn us (hoti ean katagin- 
oskéi hémon hé kardia). A construction like hoti an, what- 
ever, in John 2:5; 14:13. Katagindsk6 occurs only three 
times in the N.T., here, verse 21, Gal. 2:11. It means to 
know something against one, to condemn. Because God is 
greater than our heart (hoti meizon estin tés kardias hémon). 
Ablative kardias after the comparative meizin. And knoweth 
all things (kai gindskei panta). Just so Peter replied to 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 227 


Jesus in spite of his denials (John 21:17). God’s omnis- 
cience is linked with his love and sympathy. God knows 
every secret in our hearts. This difficult passage strikes 
the very centre of Christian truth (Brooke). 

21. If our heart condemn us not (ean hé kardia mé katagin- 
6skéi). Condition of third class with ean mé and present 
active subjunctive. The converse of the preceding, but not 
a claim to sinlessness, but the consciousness of fellowship 
in God’s presence. Boldness toward God (parrésian pros ton 
theon). Even in prayer (Heb. 4:16). See also 2:28. 

22. Whatsoever we ask (ho ean aitomen). Indefinite rela- 
tive clause with modal am and the present active subjunc- 
tive, like oti ean kataginoskéi in verse 20. In form no- 
limitations are placed here save that of complete fellowship 
with God, which means complete surrender of our will to 
that of God our Father.’ See the clear teaching of Jesus on 
this subject in Mark 11:24; Luke 11:9; John 14:12f.; 16:23 
and his example (Mark 14:36 =Matt. 26:39 =Luke 22:42). 
The answer may not always be in the form that we expect, 
but it will be better. We receive of him (lambanomen ap’. 
autou).. See 1:5 for ap’ autou (from him). Because (hoti). 
Twofold reason why we receive regularly (lambanomen) the 
answer to our prayers (1) “we keep” (téroumen, for which 
see 2:3) his commandments and (2) “we do” (poioumen, 
we practise regularly) “the things that are pleasing” (¢a 
aresta, old verbal adjective from areskd, to please, with 
dative in John 8:29 with same phrase; Acts 12:3 and in- 
finitive in Acts 6:2, only other N.T. examples) “in his 
sight” (endpion autou, common late vernacular preposition 
in papyri, LXX, and in N.T., except Matthew and Mark, 
chiefly by Luke and in the Apocalypse), in God’s eye, as in 
Heb..19:21:. 

23. His commandment (hé entolé autou). That (hina). 
Subfinal use of Aina in apposition with entole (command- 
ment) and explanatory of it, as in John 15:12 (entolé hina). 


228 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


See Christ’s summary of the commandments (Mark 12:28- 
31 =Matt. 22:34-40). So these two points here (1) We 
should believe (pisteusdmen, first aorist active subjunctive 
according to B K L, though Aleph A C read the present 
subjunctive pisteudmen) either in a crisis (aorist) or the 
continuous tenor (present) of our lives. The “name” of 
Jesus Christ here stands for all that he is, ““a compressed 
creed” (Westcott) as in 1:3. Note dative onomati here 
with pisteud as in 5:10, though eis onoma (on the name) 
in §:13; John 1:12; 2:23; 3:18. But (2) “we should love 
one another” (agapomen allélous), as he has already urged 
(2:7f.; 3:11) and as he will repeat (4:7, 11f.; II John 5) as 
Jesus (even as he gave us commandment, that is Christ) 
had previously done (John 13:34; 15:12, 17). There are 
frequent points of contact between this Epistle and the 
words of Jesus in John 13 to 17. 

24. And he in him (kai autos en autoi). That is “‘God 
abides in him” as in 4:15. We abide in God and God abides 
in us through the Holy Spirit (John 14:10, 17, 23; 17:21). 
“Therefore let God be a home to thee, and be thou the 
home of God: abide in God, and let God abide in thee” 
(Bede). By the Spirit (ek tou pneumatos). It is thus (by 
the Holy Spirit, first mention in this Epistle and ‘‘Holy” 
not used with “Spirit” in this Epistle or the Apocalypse) 
that we know that God abides in us. Which (hou). Abla- 
tive case by attraction from accusative ho (object of eddken) 
to agree with pueumatos as often, though not always. It 
is a pity that the grammatical gender (which) is retained 
here in the English instead of “‘whom,” as it should be. 


CHAPTER IV 


1. Beloved (agapétoi). Three times in this chapter (1, 7, 
11) we have this tender address on love. Believe not every 
Spirit (mé panti pneumati pisteuete). “‘Stop believing,” as 
some were clearly carried away by the spirits of error ram- 
pant among them, both Docetic and Cerinthian Gnostics. 
Credulity means gullibility and some believers fall easy 
victims to the latest fads in spiritualistic humbuggery. 
Prove the spirits (dokimazete ta pneumata). Put them to the — 
acid test of truth as the metallurgist does his metals. If it 
stands the test like a coin, it is acceptable (dokimos, II Cor. 
10:18), otherwise it is rejected (adokimos, I Cor. 9:27; II 
Cor. 13:5-7). Many false prophets (pollot pseudoprophétat). 
Jesus had warned people against them (Matt. 7:15), even 
when they as false Christs work portents (Matt. 24:11, 24; 
Mark 13:22). It is an old story (Luke 6:26) and recurs 
again and again (Acts 13:6; Rev. 16:13; 19:20; 20:10) along 
with false teachers (II Pet. 2:1). Are gone out (exeléluthasin). 
Perfect active indicative of exerchomai. Cf. aorist in 2:19. 
They are abroad always. 

2. Hereby know ye (en toutodi gindskete). Either present 
active indicative or imperative. The test of “‘the Spirit 
of God” (to pneuma tou theou) here alone in this Epistle, 
save verse 13. With the clamour of voices then and now 
this is important. The test (en toutdi, as in 3:19) follows. 
That Fesus Christ is come in the flesh (I@soun Christon en 
sarki eléluthota). The correct text (perfect active participle 
predicate accusative), not the infinitive (¢/é/uthenai, B Vg). 
The predicate participle (see John 9:22 for predicate accusa- 
tive with homologed) describes Jesus as already come in the 
flesh (his actual humanity, not a phantom body as the 

229 


230 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Docetic Gnostics held). See this same idiom in II John 7 
with erchomenon (coming). A like test is proposed by Paul 
for confessing the deity of Jesus Christ in I Cor. 12:3 and 
for the Incarnation and Resurrection of Jesus in Rom. 
10:6-10. 

3. Confesseth not (mé homologei). Indefinite relative clause 
with the subjective negative mé rather than the usual ob- 
jective negative ou (verse 6). It is seen also in II Pet. 1:9 
and Titus 1:11, a survival of the literary construction 
(Moulton, Prolegomena, p. 171). The Vulgate (along with 
Irenzus, Tertullian, Augustine) reads so/vit (/uei) instead 
of mé homologei, which means “separates Jesus,” apparently 
an allusion to the Cerinthian heresy (distinction between 
Jesus and Christ) as the clause before refers to the Docetic 
heresy. Many MSS. have here also en sarki eléluthota re- 
peated from preceding clause, but not A B Vg Cop. and not 
genuine. The spirit of the antichrist (to tou antichristou). 
Pneuma (spirit) not expressed, but clearly implied by the 
neuter singular article ¢o. It is a repetition of the point 
about antichrists made in 2:18-25. Whereof (ho). Accusa- 
tive of person (grammatical neuter referring to pneuma) 
with akoud along with accusative of the thing (Aoti erchetai, 
as in 2:18, futuristic present middle indicative). Here the 
perfect active indicative (akékoate), while in 2:18 the aorist 
(@kousate). And now already (kai nun édé). As in 2:18 also 
(many have come). “The prophecy had found fulfilment 
before the Church had looked for it” (Westcott). It is — 
often so. For édé see John 4:35; 9:27. 

4. Have overcome them (nenikékate autous). Perfect active 
indicative of uikad, calm confidence: of final victory as in 
2:13 and John 16:33. The reference in autous (them) is 
to the false prophets in 4:1. Because (hoti). The reason for 
the victory lies in God, who abides in them (3:20, 24; John 
14:20; 1§:4f.). God is greater than Satan, “‘he that is in 
the world” (ho en toi kosméi), the prince of this world 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 231 


(John 12:31; 14:30), the god of this age (II Cor. 4:4), 
powerful as he seems. 

5. Of the world (ek tou kosmou). As Jesus is not and as 
the disciples are not (John 17:14ff.). 4s of the world (ek 
tou kosmou). No “‘as” (Ads), but that is the idea, for their 
talk proceeds from the world and wins a ready hearing. 
The false prophets and the world are in perfect unison. 

6. We (hémeis). In sharp contrast with the false prophets 
and the world. We are in tune with the Infinite God. 
Hence “‘he that knoweth God” (ho gindskon ton theon, pres- 
ent active articular participle, the one who keeps on getting 
acquainted with God, growing in his knowledge of God) 
“hears us” (akouei hémon). This is one reason why sermons — 
are dull (some actually are, others so to dull hearers) or 
inspiring. There is a touch of mysticism here, to be sure, 
but the heart of Christianity is mysticism (spiritual con- 
tact with God in Christ by the Holy Spirit). John states 
the same idea negatively by a relative clause parallel with 
the preceding articular participle, the negative with both 
clauses. John had felt the cold, indifferent, and hostile 
stare of the worldling as he preached Jesus. By this (ek 
toutou). “From this,” deduction drawn from the preceding; 
only example in the Epistle for the common en toutdi as in 
4:2. The power of recognition (gindskomen, we know by 
personal experience) belongs to all believers (Westcott). 
There is no reason for Christians being duped by ‘“‘the spirit 
of error” (to pneuma tés planés), here alone in the N.T., 
though we have pueumasin planois (misleading spirits) in 
I Tim. 4:1. Rejection of the truth may be due also to our 
not speaking the truth in love (Eph. 4:15). 

7. Of God (ek tou theou). Even human love comes from 
God, ‘‘a reflection of something in the Divine nature itself” 
(Brooke). John repeats the old commandment of 2:7f. 
Persistence in loving (present tense agapomen indicative and 
agapon participle) is proof that one “has been begotten of 


232 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


God” (ek tou theou gegennétai as in 2:29) and is acquainted 
with God. Otherwise mere claim to loving God accompanied 
by hating one’s brother is a lie (2:9-11). 

8. He that loveth not (ho mé agapon). Present active ar- 
ticular participle of agapaé “keeps on not loving.” Knoweth 
not God (ouk egnoé ton theon). ‘Timeless aorist active indica- 
tive of gindsk0, has no acquaintance with God, never did get 
acquainted with him. God is love (ho theos agapé estin). 
Anarthrous predicate, not hé agapé. John does not say that 
love is God, but only that God is love. The two terms are 
not interchangeable. God is also light (1:5) and spirit (John 
4:24). 

9. Was manifested (ephanerothé). First aorist passive in- 
dicative of phanerod. The Incarnation as in 3:5. Subjective 
genitive as in 2:5. In us (en hemin). In our case, not 
“among us” nor “to us.” Cf. Gal. 1:16. Hath sent (apes- 
talken). Perfect active indicative of apostellé, as again in 
verse 14, the permanent mission of the Son, though in verse 
10 the aorist apesteilen occurs for the single event. See John 
3:16 for this great idea. His only-begotten Son (ton huion 
autou ton monogené). “‘His Son the only-begotten” as in 
John 3:16. John applies monogenés to Jesus alone (John. 
1:14, 18), but Luke (7:12; 8:42; 9:38) to others. Jesus alone 
completely reproduces the nature and character of God 
(Brooke). That we might live through him (hina zésimen di’ 
autou). Purpose clause with hina and the first aorist (in- 
gressive, get life) active subjunctive of 24d. “Through him” | 
is through Christ, who is the life (John 14:6). Christ also 
lives in us (Gal. 2:20). This life begins here and now. 

10. Not that (ouch hoti)—but that (all’ hoti). Sharp con- 
trast as in John 7:22; II Cor. 7:9; Phil. 4:17. We loved 
(2gapésamen). First aorist active indicative, but B reads 
égapekamen (perfect active, we have loved). He (autos). 
Emphatic nominative (God). To be the propitiation (hilas- 
mon). Merely predicate accusative in apposition with huion 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 233 


(Son). For the word see 2:2 and Rom. 3:25 for hilastérion, 
and for peri see also 2:2. 

11. If God so loved us (ei houtds ho theos égapésen hémas). 
Condition of first class with ¢i and the first aorist active 
indicative. As in John 3:16, so here houtds emphasises the 
manifestation of God’s love both in its manner and in its 
extent (Rom. 8:32). Ought-(opheilomen). As in 2:6. No- 
blesse oblige. ‘“Keep on loving,” (agapdin) as in 3:11. 

12. No one hath beheld God at any time (theon oudeis popote 
tetheatai). Perfect middle indicative of theaomai (John 1:14). 
Almost the very words of John 1:18 theon oudeis popote heo- 
raken (instead of tetheatai). If we love one another (ean aga- 
pomen allélous). Third-class condition with ean and the © 
present active subjunctive, “if we keep on loving one an- 
other.” God abideth in us (ho theos en hémin menei). Else 
we cannot go on loving one another. His love (hé agapé 
autou). More than merely subjective or objective (2:5; 4:9). 
“Mutual love is a sign of the indwelling of God in men” 
(Brooke). Is perfected (teteleidmené estin). Periphrastic (see 
usual form teteleidtai in 2:5 and 4:17) perfect passive indic- 
ative of feleiod (cf. 1:4). See verse 18 for “perfect love.” 

13. Hereby know we (en toutdi gindskomen). The Chris- 
tian’s consciousness of the fact of God dwelling in him is due 
to the Spirit of God whom God has given (dedoken, perfect 
active indicative here, though the aorist eddken in 3:24). 
This gift of God is proof of our fellowship with God. 

14. We have beheld (tetheametha). Perfect middle of thea- 
omai as in verse 12, though the aorist in 1:1 and John 1:14 
(etheasametha). John is qualified to bear witness (marturou- 
men as in 1:2) as Jesus had charged the disciples to do (Acts 
1:8). Hath sent (apestalken). As in verse 9, though apes- 
teilen in verse 10. To be the Saviour of the world (sotera tou 
kosmou). Predicate accusative of sdtér (Saviour), like Ailas- 
mon in verse 10. This very phrase occurs elsewhere only in 


234 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


John 4:42 as the confession of the Samaritans, but the idea 
is in John 3:17. 

15. Whosoever shall confess (hos ean homoldgéséi). Indefi- 
nite relative clause with modal ean (=am) and the first 
aorist active subjunctive, “whoever confesses.” See 2:23 
and 4:2f. for homologed. That (hoti). Object clause (indirect 
assertion) after homologed. This confession of the deity of 
Jesus Christ implies surrender and obedience also, not mere 
lip service (cf. I Cor. 12:3; Rom. 10:6-12). This confession 
is proof (if genuine) of the fellowship with God (1:3f.; 3:24). 

16. We know (egnokamen). Perfect active indicative, ‘‘we 
have come to know and still know” as in John 6:9, only 
there order is changed (pepisteukamen coming before egnd- 
kamen). Confession (homologeo) follows experimental knowl- 
edge (gindsk0) and confident trust (pisteud). Believers are 
the sphere (e” hémin, in our case) in which the love of God 
operates (Westcott). See John 13:35 for ““having love.” 
God 1s love (ho theos agapé estin). Repeated from verse 8. 
So he gathers up the whole argument that one who is abiding 
in love is abiding in God and shows that God is abiding in 
him. Thoroughly Johannine style. 

17. Herein (en toutoi). It is not clear whether the hina 
clause (sub-final use) is in apposition with ev toutéi as in 
John 15:8 or the oti clause (because) with the hina clause 
as parenthesis. Either makes sense. Westcott argues for 
the latter idea, which is reinforced by the preceding sentence. 
With us (meth hémon). Construed with the verb feteleidtai ~ 
(is perfected). In contrast to en hémin (verses 12, 16), em- 
phasising codperation. ‘God works with man” (Westcott). 
For boldness (parrésian) in the day of judgment (only here 
with both articles, but often with no articles as in II Pet. 
2:9) see 2:28. As he is (kathos ekeinos estin). That is Christ 
as in 2:6; 3:3, 5, 7, 16. Same tense (present) as in 3:7. 
“Love is a heavenly visitant” (David Smith). We are in 
this world to manifest Christ. 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 235 


18. Fear (phobos). Like a bond-slave (Rom. 8:15), not 
the reverence of a son (eulabeia, Heb. §:7f.) or the obedi- 
ence to a father (en phodbdi, I Pet. 1:17). This kind of dread 
is the opposite of parrésia (boldness). Perfect love (hé teleia 
agape). ‘There is such a thing, perfect because it has been 
perfected (verses 12, 17). Cf. James 1:4. Casteth out fear 
(exd ballei ton phobon). ‘“‘Drives fear out” so that it does 
not exist in real love. See ekballé exd in John 6:37; 9:34f.; 
12:31; 15:6 to turn out-of-doors, a powerful metaphor. Per- 
fect love harbours no suspicion and no dread (I Cor. 13). 
Hath punishment (kolasin echei). Old word, in N.T. only 
here and Matt. 25:46. Timdoria has only the idea of penalty, . 
kolasis has also that of discipline, while paideia has that of 
chastisement (Heb. 12:7). The one who still dreads (pho- 
boumenos) has not been made perfect in love (ou teteletdtat). 
Bengel graphically describes different types of men: “sine 
timore et amore; cum timore sine amore; cum timore et amore; 
sine timore cum amore.” 

19. He first (autos protos). Note protos (nominative), not 
proton, as in John 20:4, 8. God loved us efore we loved him 
(John 3:16). Our love is in response to his love for us. 
Agapomen is indicative (we love), not subjunctive (let us 
love) of the same form. There is no object expressed here. 

20. If a man say (ean tis eipéi). Condition of third class 
with ean and second aorist active subjunctive. Suppose one 
say. Cf. 1:6. I love God (Agapo ton theon). Quoting an 
imaginary disputant as in 2:4. And hateth (kai miset). 
Continuation of the same condition with eam and the pres- 
ent active subjunctive, “and keep on hating.” See 2:9 and 
3:15 for use of mised (hate) with adelphos (brother). 4 liar 
(pseustés). Blunt and to the point as in 1:10; 2:4. That 
loveth not (ho mé agapon). “The one who does not keep on 
loving” (present active negative articular participle). Hath 
seen (heoraken). Perfect active indicative of horad, the form 
in John 1:18 used of seeing God. Cannot love (ou dunatai 


236 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


agapain). “Is not able to go on loving,” with which com- 
pare 2:9, 0u dunatai hamartanein (is not able to go on sin- 
ning). The best MSS. do not have pds (how) here. 

21. That (hina). Sub-final object clause in apposition 
with entolén as in John 13:34; 15:13. From him (ap’ autou). 
Either God or Christ. See Mark 12:29-31 for this old com- 
mandment (2:7f.). 


CHAPTER V 


1. That Fesus is the Christ (hoti [ésous estin ho Christos). 
The Cerinthian antichrist denies the identity of Jesus and 
Christ (2:22). Hence John insists on this form of faith 
(pisteuon here in the full sense, stronger than in 3:23; 4:16, 
seen also in pistis in verse 4, where English and Latin fall 
down in having to use another word for the verb) as he 
does in verse 5 and in accord with the purpose of John’s 
Gospel (20:31). Nothing less will satisfy John, not merely © 
intellectual conviction, but full surrender to Jesus Christ as 
Lord and Saviour. “The Divine Begetting is the antecedent, 
not the consequent of the believing” (Law). For “‘is be- 
gotten of God” (ek tou theou gegennétai) see 2:29; 3:93 4:73 
5:4, 18. John appeals here to family relationship and family 
love. Him that begat (ton gennésanta). First aorist active 
articular participle of gennad, to beget, the Father (our 
heavenly Father). Him also that is begotten of him (ton 
gegennémenon ex autou). Perfect passive articular participle 
of gennad, the brother or sister by the same father. So 
then we prove our love for the common Father by our con- 
duct towards our brothers and sisters in Christ. 

2. Hereby (en toutdi). John’s usual phrase for the test of 
the sincerity of our love. ‘The love of God and the love 
of the brethren do in fact include each the other” (West- 
cott). Each is a test of the other. So put 3:14 with 5:2. 
When (hotan). ‘‘Whenever” indefinite temporal clause with 
hotan and the present active subjunctive (the same form 
agapomen as the indicative with hoti (that) just before, 
“whenever we keep on loving God.” And do (kai poidmen) 
“‘and whenever we keep on doing (present active subjunc- 

237 


238 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


tive of poied) his commandments.” See 1:6 for ‘“‘doing the 
truth.” 

3. This (haut@)—that (hina). Explanatory use of hina 
with hauté, as in John 17:3, to show what “the love of 
God” (4:9, 12) in the objective sense is, not mere declama- 
tory boasting (4:20), but obedience to God’s commands, 
“that we keep on keeping (present active subjunctive as in 
2:3) his commandments.” This is the supreme test. re 
not grievous (bareiai ouk eisin). “Not heavy,” the adjective 
in Matt. 23:4 with phortia (burdens), with /upoi (wolves) in 
Acts 20:29, of Paul’s letters in II Cor. 10:10, of the charges 
against Paul in Acts 25:7. Love for God lightens his com~ 
mands. 

4. For (hoti). The reason why God’s commandments are 
not heavy is the power that comes with the new birth from 
God. Whatsoever is begotten of God (pan to gegennémenon 
ek tou theou). Neuter singular perfect passive participle of 
gennao rather than the masculine singular (verse 1) to ex- 
press sharply the universality of the principle (Rothe) as 
in John 3:6, 8; 6:37, 39. Overcometh the world (ntkai ton 
kosmon). Present active indicative of nikad, a continuous 
victory because a continuous struggle, “Keeps on conquer- 
ing the world” (“the sum of all the forces antagonistic to 
the spiritual life,” D. Smith). This is the victory (hauté 
estin hé ntké). Yor this form of expression see 1:5; John 
1:19. Niké (victory, cf. nikad), old word, here alone in 
N.T., but the later form nikos in Matt. 12:20 and I Cor. 
15: af 57. That overcometh (hé nikésasa). First aorist ac- 
tive articular participle of nikad. The English cannot re- 
produce the play on the word here. The aorist tense singles 
out an individual experience when one believed or when 
one met temptation with victory. Jesus won the victory 
over the world (John 16:33) and God in us (I John 4:4) 
gives us the victory. Even our faith (hé pistis hemon). The 
only instance of pistis in the Johannine Epistles (not in 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 239 


John’s Gospel, though in the Apocalypse). It is our faith 
in Jesus Christ as shown by our confession (verse 1) and 
by our life (verse 2). 

5. And who is he that overcometh? (tis estin de ho nikon?). 
Not a mere rhetorical question (2:22), but an appeal. to 
experience and fact. ‘Note the present active articular par- 
ticiple (zikdn) like nikai (present active indicative in verse 
4), ‘‘the one who keeps on conquering the world.” See I 
Cor. 15:57 for the same note of victory (mikos) through 
Christ. See verse 1 for ho pisteudn (the one who believes) 
as here. Fesus is the Son of God (Iésous estin ho huios tou 
theou). As in verse 1 save that here ho huios tou theou in 
place of Christos and see both in 2:22f. Here there is sharp — 
antithesis between “Jesus” (humanity) and “‘the Son of 
God” (deity) united in the one personality. 

6. This (houtos). Jesus the Son of God (verse 5). He 
that came (ho elthon). Second aorist active articular par- 
ticiple of erchomai, referring to the Incarnation as a definite 
historic event, the preéxistent Son of God “‘sent from heaven 
to do God’s will” (Brooke). By water and blood (di’ hudatos 
kai haimatos). Accompanied by (dia used with the genitive 
both as instrument and accompaniment, as in Gal. 5:13) 
water (as at the baptism) and blood (as on the Cross). 
These two incidents in the Incarnation are singled out be- 
cause at the baptism Jesus was formally set apart to his 
Messianic work by the coming of the Holy Spirit upon him 
and by the Father’s audible witness, and because at the 
Cross his work reached its culmination (“It is finished,” 
Jesus said). There are other theories that do not accord 
with the language and the facts. It is true that at the Cross 
both water and blood came out of the side of Jesus when 
pierced by the soldier, as John bore witness (John 19:34), a 
complete refutation of the Docetic denial of an actual human 
body for Jesus and of the Cerinthian distinction between 
Jesus and Christ. There is thus a threefold witness to the 


240 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


fact of the Incarnation, but he repeats the twofold witness 
before giving the third. The repetition of both preposition 
(en this time rather than dia) and the article (¢0i locative 
case) argues for two separate events with particular em- 
phasis on the blood (“‘not only” ouk monon, “but” all’) 
which the Gnostics made light of or even denied. It is the 
Spirit that beareth witness (to pneuma estin to marturoun). 
Present active articular participle of martured with article 
with both subject and predicate, and so interchangeable as 
in 3:4. The Holy Spirit is the third and the chief witness 
at the baptism of Jesus and all through his ministry. Be- 
cause (hoti). Or declarative ‘“‘that.” Either makes sense. 
In John 15:26 Jesus spoke of “the Spirit of truth” (whose 
characteristic is truth). Here John identifies the Spirit with 
truth as Jesus said of himself (John 14:6) without denying 
personality for the Holy Spirit. 

7. For there are three who bear witness (hoti treis eisin hoi 
_ marturountes). At this point the Latin Vulgate gives the 
words in the Textus Receptus, found in no Greek MS. save 
two late cursives (162 in the Vatican Library of the fifteenth 
century, 34 of the sixteenth century in Trinity College, 
Dublin). Jerome did not have it. Cyprian applies the 
language of the Trinity and Priscillian has it. Erasmus did 
not have it in his first edition, but rashly offered to insert 
it if a single Greek MS. had it and 34 was produced with 
the insertion, as if made to order. The spurious addition is: 
en toi ouranodi ho pater, ho logos kai to hagion pneuma kai 
houtoi hoi treis hen eisin kai treis eisin hoi marturountes en 
tet géi (in heaven, the Father, the. Word, and the Holy 
Ghost: and these three are one. And there are three that 
bear witness in earth). The last clause belongs to verse 8. 
The fact and the doctrine of the Trinity do not depend on 
this spurious addition. Some Latin scribe caught up Cyp- 
rian’s exegesis and wrote it on the margin of his text, and 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 241 


so it got into the Vulgate and finally into the Textus Re- 
ceptus by the stupidity of Erasmus. 

8. The Spirit and the water and the blood (to pneuma kai 
to hudor kai to haima). The same three witnesses of verses 
6 and 7 repeated with the Spirit first. The three (hoi treis). 
The resumptive article. Agree in one (eis to hen eisin). 
“Are for the one thing,” to: bring us to faith in Jesus as the 
Incarnate Son of God, the very purpose for which John 
wrote his Gospel (20:31). 

g. If we receive (ei lambanomen). Condition of first class 
with ei and the present active indicative, assumed as true. 
The conditions for a legally valid witness are laid down in — 
Deut. 19:15 (cf. Matt. 18:16; John 8:17f.; 10:25; II Cor. 
13:1). Greater (meizon). Comparative of megas, because 
God is always true. For (hoti). So it applies to this case. 
That (hoti). Thus taken in the declarative sense (the fact 
that) as in John 3:19, though it can be causal (because) or 
indefinite relative with memarturzken (what he hath testi- 
fied, perfect active indicative of martured, as in John 1:32; 
4:44, etc.), a harsh construction here because of marturia, 
though some MSS. do read hen to agree with it (cf. verse 
10). See oti ean in 3:20 for that idiom. Westcott notes 
the Trinity in verses 6 to g: the Son comes, the Spirit wit- 
nesses, the Father has witnessed. 

10. Believeth on (pisteuon eis). John draws a distinction 
between “not believing God” (mé pisteudn toi thedi) in next 
clause, the testimony of God about his Son, and surrender 
to and reliance on the Son as here (eis and the accusative). 
See the same distinction less clearly drawn in John 6:30f. 
See also eis ten marturian after pepisteuken in this same verse 
and John 2:23. In him (en hautoi). “In himself,” though 
the evidence is not decisive between hautoi and autoi. Hath 
made (pepoiéken). Perfect active indicative of poied like 
memarturéken and pepisteuken, permanent state. 4 liar 
(pseustén). As in 1:10, which see. Because he hath not be- 


242 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


lieved (hoti ou pepisteuken). Actual negative reason with 
negative ou, not the subjective reason as in John 3:18, where 
we have hoti mé pepisteuken). The subjective negative is 
regular with ho mé pisteudn. Relative clause here repeats 
close of verse g. 

11. That God gave (hoti edoken ho theos). Declarative hoti 
in apposition with marturia as in verse 14 and John 3:19. 
Note aorist active indicative edoken (from didémi) as in 
3:23f., the great historic fact of the Incarnation (John 3:16), 
but the perfect dedoken in I John 3:1 to emphasize the abid- 
ing presence of God’s love. Eternal life (zéén aionion). An- 
arthrous emphasizing quality, but with the article in 1:2. 
In his Son (en toi huioi autou). This life and the witness 
also. This is why Jesus who is life (John 14:6) came to give 
us abundant life (John 10:10). 

12. Hath the life (echei ten z0én). The life which God gave 
(verse 11). This is the position of Jesus himself (John 5:24; 
14:6). 

13. I have written (egrapsa). Not epistolary aorist, but 
refers to verses I to 12 of this Epistle as in 2:26 to the pre- 
ceding verses. That ye may know (hina eidéte). Purpose 
clause with hina and the second perfect active subjunctive of 
oida, to know with settled intuitive knowledge. He wishes 
them to have eternal life in Christ (John 20:31) and to know 
that they have it, but not with flippant superficiality (2:3ff.). 
Unto you that believe on (tois pisteuousin eis). Dative of the 
articular present active participle of pistewd and eis as in 
verse 10. For this use of oxoma (name) with pisteud see 
3:23; John 2:23. 

14. Toward him (pros auton). Fellowship with (pros, face 
to face) Christ. For boldness see 2:28. That (hoti). De- 
clarative again, as in verse 11. Jf we ask anything (ean ti 
aitometha). Condition of third class with eam and present 
middle (indirect) subjunctive (personal interest as in James 
4:3, though the point is not to be pressed too far, for see 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 243 


Matt. 20:20, 22; John 16:24, 26). According to his will (kata 
to theléma autou). This is the secret in all prayer, even in 
the case of Jesus himself. For the phrase see I Pet. 4:19; 
Gal. 1:4; Eph. 1:5, 11. He heareth us (akouei hemon). Even 
when God does not give us what we ask, in particular then 
(Heb. 5:7f.). 

15. And if we know (kai ean oidamen). Condition of first 
class with ean (usually e2) and the perfect active indicative, 
assumed as true. See I Thess. 3:8 and Acts 8:31 for the 
indicative with ean as in the papyri. ‘“‘An amplification of 
the second limitation” (D. Smith). Wahatsoever we ask (ho 
ean aitometha). Indefinite relative clause with modal ean 
(=an) and the present middle (as for ourselves) subjunctive — 
of aited. This clause, like Aémén, is also the object of akouei. 
We know that we have (oidamen hoti echomen). Repetition of 
oidamen, the confidence of possession by anticipation. The 
petitions (ta aitemata). Old word, from aited, requests, here 
only in John, elsewhere in N.T. Luke 23:24; Phil. 4:6. We 
have the answer already as in Mark 11:24. We have asked 
(zitékamen). Perfect active indicative of aited, the asking 
abiding. y 

16. If any man see (ean tis idéi). Third-class condition 
with ean and second aorist active subjunctive of eidon (horad). 
Sinning a sin (hamartanonta hamartian). Present active 
predicate (supplementary) participle agreeing with adelphon 
and with cognate accusative hamartian. Not unto death (mé 
pros thanaton). Repeated again with hamartanousin and in 
contrast with hamartia pros thanaton (sin unto death). Most 
sins are not mortal sins, but clearly John conceives of a sin 
that is deadly enough to be called “unto death.” This dis- 
tinction is common in the rabbinic writings and in Numb. 
18:22 the LXX has Jabein hamartian thanatéphoron “to incur 
a death-bearing sin” as many crimes then and now bear 
the death penalty. There is a distinction in Heb. 10:26 
between sinning wilfully after full knowledge and sins of 


244 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


ignorance (Heb. 5:2). Jesus spoke of the unpardonable sin 
(Mark 3:29; Matt. 12:32; Luke 12:10), which was attributing 
to the devil the manifest work of the Holy Spirit. It is pos- 
sible that John has this idea in mind when he applies it to 
those who reject Jesus Christ as God’s Son and set themselves 
up as antichrists. Concerning this (peri ekeinés). This sin 
unto death. That he should make request (hina erotéséi). 
Sub-final use of hina with the first aorist active subjunctive 
of erdtad, used here as in John 17:15 and 20 (and often) for 
request rather than for question. John does not forbid 
praying for such cases; he simply does not command prayer 
for them. He leaves them to God. 

17. All unrighteousness is sin (pasa adikia hamartia estin). 
Unrighteousness is one manifestation of sin as lawlessness 
(3:4) 1s another (Brooke). The world today takes sin too 
lightly, even jokingly as a mere animal inheritance. Sin is 
a terrible reality, but there is no cause for despair. Sin not 
unto death can be overcome in Christ. 

18. We know (oidamen). As in 3:2, 14; 5:15, 19, 20. He 
has “‘ye know” in 2:20; 3:5, 15. Sinneth not (ouch hamar- 
tanei). Lineal present active indicative, “does not keep on 
sinning,” as he has already shown in 3:4-10. He that was 
begotten of God (ho gennétheis ek tou theou). First aorist 
passive articular participle referring to Christ, if the reading 
of A B is correct (térei auton, not térei heauton). It is Christ 
who keeps the one begotten of God (gegennémenos ek tou 
theou as in 3:9 and so different from ho gennétheis here). It 
is a difficult phrase, but this is probably the idea. Jesus 
(John 18:37) uses gegennémai of himself and uses also téred 
of keeping the disciples (John 17:12, 15; Rev. 3:10). The 
evil one (ho ponéros). Masculine and personal as in 2:13, 
not neuter, and probably Satan as in Matt. 6:13, not just 
any evil man. Touchest him not (ouch haptetai autou). 
Present middle indicative of haptd, elsewhere in John only. 
John 20:17. It means to lay hold of or to grasp rather than 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 245 


a mere superficial touch (¢higgand, both in Col. 2:21). Here 
the idea is to touch to harm. The devil cannot snatch such 
a man from Christ (John 6:38f.). 

19. Of God (ek tou theou). See 3:10 and 4:6 for this idiom. 
Lieth in the evil one (en toi ponéroi keitai). Present middle 
indicative of the deféctive verb keimai, to lie, as in Luke 
2:12. Ponérdi is masculine, like ho ponéros in verse 18. 
This is a terrible picture of the Graeco-Roman world of the 
first century A.D., which is confirmed by Paul in Romans 
I and 2 and by Horace, Seneca, Juvenal, Tacitus. 

20. Is come (hékei). Present active indicative, but the 
root has a perfect sense, ‘has come.” See exélthon kai héki 
in John 8:42. An understanding (dianoian). Here alone in 
John’s writings, but in Paul (Eph. 4:18) and Peter (I Pet. 
1:13). John does not use gwdsis (knowledge) and nous 
(mind) only in Rev. 13:18; 17:9. That we know (hina ginos- 
komen). Result clause with Aina and the present active 
indicative, as is common with Aina and the future indicative 
(John 7:3). It is possible that here o was pronounced 6 as 
a subjunctive, but many old MSS. have hina gindskousin 
(plainly indicative) in John 17:3, and in many other places 
in the N.T. the present indicative with hina occurs as a 
variant reading as in John 5:20. Him that is true (ton alé- 
thinon). That is, God. Cf. 1:8. In him that is true (en toi 
aléthinoi). In God in contrast with the world “‘in the evil 
one” (verse 19). See John 17:3. Even in his Son Fesus 
Christ (en toi huidi autou Ié@sou Christoi). The autou refers 
clearly to en toi aléthinoi (God). Hence this clause is not in 
apposition with the preceding, but an explanation as to how 
we are “in the True One” by being “‘in his Son Jesus Christ.” 
This (houtos). Grammatically houtos may refer to Jesus 
Christ or to “the True One.” It is a bit tautological to 
refer it to God, but that is probably correct, God in Christ, 
at any rate. God is eternal life (John 5:26) and he gives it 
to us through Christ. 


246 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


21. Yourselves (heauta). Neuter plural reflexive because 
of teknia. The active voice phulassete with the reflexive ac- 
cents the need of effort on their part. Idolatry was every- 
where and the peril was great. See Acts 7:41: I Thess. 1:9 
for this word.

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


There is little to add to what was said about the First 
Epistle except that here the author terms himself “‘the elder” 
(ho presbuteros) and writes to “the elect lady” (eklektei 
kuriai). ‘There is dispute about both of these titles. Some 
hold that it is the mythical “presbyter John” of whom 
Papias may speak, if so understood, but whose very existence 
is disproved by Dom Chapman in Fohn the Presbyter and 
the Fourth Gospel (1911). Peter the apostle (I Pet. 1:1) © 
calls himself “‘fellow-elder” (sunpresbuteros) with the other 
elders (I Pet. 5:1). The word referred originally to age 
(Luke 15:25), then to rank or office as in the Sanhedrin 
(Matt. 16:21; Acts 6:12) and in the Christian churches (Acts 
11:30; 20:17; I Tim. 5:17, 19) as here also. A few even deny 
that the author is the same as in the First Epistle of John, 
but just an imitator. But the bulk of modern scholarly 
opinion agrees that the same man wrote all three Epistles 
and the Fourth Gospel (the Beloved Disciple, and many 
still say the Apostle John) whatever is true of the Apoca- 
lypse. There is no way of deciding whether “the elect lady” 
is a woman or achurch. The obvious way of taking it is to 
a woman of distinction in one of the churches, as is true of 
“the co-elect lady in Babylon” (I Pet. 5:13), Peter’s wife, 
who travelled with him (I Cor. 9:5). Some even take kuria 
to be the name of the lady (Cyria). Some also take it to 
be “Eklecta the lady.” Dr. Findlay (Fellowship in the Life 
Eternal, p. 31) holds that Pergamum is the church to which 
the letter was sent. The same commentaries treat I, II, 
and III John as a rule, though Poggel has a book on II, 
III John (1896) and Bresky (1906) has Das Verhaltnis des 
Zweiten Fohannesbriefes zum dritten. Dr. J. Rendel Harris 

249 


250 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


has an interesting article in The Expositor of London for 
March, 1901, on “‘The Problem of the Address to the Second 
Epistle of John,” in which he argues from papyri examples 
that kuria here means “my dear” or ‘‘my lady.” But Find- 
lay (Fellowship in the Life Eternal, p. 26) argues that ‘the 
qualifying adjunct ‘elect’ lifts us into the region of Christian 
calling and dignity.” It is not certain that II John was 
written after I John, though probable. Origen rejected it 
and the Peshitta Syriac does not have II and III John. 

1. And her children (kai tois teknois autés). As with eklekté 
kuria, so here tekna may be understood either literally as in 
I Tim. 3:4, or spiritually, as in Gal. 4:19, 25; I Tim. 1:2. 
For the spiritual sense in teknia see I John 2:1, 12. Whom 
(hous). Masculine accusative plural, though ¢eknois is neuter 
plural (dative), construction according to sense, not accord- 
ing to grammatical gender, “embracing the mother and 
the children of both sexes” (Vincent). See thus fous in 
Gal. 4:19. I (Egd). Though ho presbuteros is third person, 
he passes at once after the Greek idiom to the first and there 
is also special emphasis here in the use of agapd with the 
addition of en a/letheidi (in truth, in the highest sphere, as in 
John 17:19 and III John 1) and ouk egd monos (not I only, 
“not I alone”). Brooke argues that this language is unsuit- 
able if to a single family and not to a church. But Paul 
employs this very phrase in sending greetings to Prisca 
and Aquila (Rom. 16:4). That know (hoi egnokotes). Per- 
fect active articular participle of gindskd, “those that have 
come to know and still know.” 

2. For the truth’s sake (dia ten alétheian). Repetition of 
the word, one of which John is very fond (I John 1:6, “the 
truth, as revealed by the Christ, and gradually unfolded 
by the Spirit, who is truth” (Brooke). Which abideth in us 
(t2n menousan en hémin). See John 17:19 for “sanctified 
in truth” and I John 2:6 for abiding in Christ, and so it 
includes all who are in Christ. It shall be with us (meth 


SECOND EPISTLE OF JOHN oo 


hemon estat). Confident assertion, not a mere wish. Note 
the order of the words, ‘‘With us it shall be” (estai future 
middle of eimi). 

3. Shall be with us (estai meth’ hémon). He picks up the 
words before in reverse order. Future indicative here, not 
a wish with the optative (eie) as we have in I Pet. 1:2; II 
Pet. 1:2. The salutation is like that in the Pastoral Epis- 
tles: ‘Charis, the wellspring in the heart of God; eleos, its 
outpourings; ezréné, its blessed effect” (David Smith). And 
from Fesus Christ (kai para Iesou Christou). The repetition 
of para (with the ablative) is unique. “It serves to bring 
out distinctly the twofold personal relation of man to the_ 
Father and to the Son” (Westcott). “The Fatherhood of 
God, as revealed by one who being His Son can reveal the 
Father, and who as man (Jésou) can make him known to 
men” (Brooke). 

4. I rejoice (echarén). Second aorist passive of chairé as 
in III John 3, “of a glad surprise” (D. Smith), as in Mark 
14:11, over the discovery about the blessing of their godly 
home on these lads. Greatly (lian). Only here and III 
John 3 in John’s writings. I have found (heuréka). Perfect 
active indicative of heuriské as in John 1:41, our “eureka,” 
here with its usual force, a continued discovery. ‘‘He sits 
down at once and writes to Kyria. How glad she would be 
that her lads, far away in the great city, were true to their 
early faith” (David Smith). Certain of thy children (ek ton 
teknon). No tinas as one would expect before ek, a not in- 
frequent idiom in the N.T. (John 16:17). Walking (peri- 
patountas). Present active accusative supplementary par- 
ticiple agreeing with ¢inas understood. Probably members 
of the church off here in Ephesus. In truth (en alétheiai). 
As in verse 1 and III John 4. We received (elabomen). 
Second aorist active (possibly, though not certainly, liter- 
ary plural) of Jamband. This very idiom (entolen lambano) 


252 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


in John 10:18; Acts 17:15; Col. 4:10. Perhaps the reference 
here is to I John 2:7f.; 3:23. 

5. Beseech (eroto). For pray as in I John 5:16. Lady 
(kuria). Vocative case and in the same sense as in I. 4s 
though I wrote (hos graphon). Common idiom /és with the 
participle (present active) for the alleged reason. New 
(kainén). Asin I John 2:7f., which see. We had (eichamen). 
Imperfect active (late -a form like eichan in Mark 8:7) of 
echo and note eichete with ap’ archés in I John 2:7. Not 
literary plural, John identifying all Christians with himself 
in this blessing. That we love one another (hina agapomen 
allélous). Either a final clause after erdtd as in John 17:15 
or an object clause in apposition with ento/én, like I John 
2:27; 3:23 and like verse 6. 

6. Love (hé agapé). The love just mentioned. That we 
Should walk (hina peripatomen). Object clause in nominative 
case in apposition with agapé, with hina and the present 
active subjunctive of peripated, “that we keep on walking.” 
The commandment (hé entolé). The one just mentioned with 
the same construction with hina as in I John 3:23. John 
changes from the first person plural to the second (@kousate 
as in I John 2:7, peripatéte) as in I John 2:5, 7. In it (en 
autéi). Either to alétheiai (truth) of verse 4, agapé of this 
verse, or entolé of this verse. Either makes good sense, prob- 
ably “in love.” With peripated (walk) we have often en 
(I John 1:7, 11, etc.) or kata (according to) as in Mark 7:5; 

I Cor. 3:3; II Cor. 10:2, ete. 

7. Deceivers (planoi). Late adjective (Diodorus, Josephus) 
meaning wandering, roving (I Tim. 4:1). As a substantive 
in N.T. of Jesus (Matt. 27:63), of Paul (II Cor. 6:8), and 
here. See the verb (tén planontin humas) in I John 2:26 
of the Gnostic deceivers as here and also of Jesus (John 
7:12). Cf. I John 1:8. Are gone forth (exélthan, alpha end- 
ing). Second aorist active indicative of exerchomai, per- 
haps an allusion to the crisis when they left the churches 


SECOND EPISTLE OF JOHN 253 


(I John 2:19, same form). Even they that confess not (hot 
mé homologountes). ‘“The ones not confessing” (mé regular 
negative with the participle). The articular participle de- 
scribes the deceivers (planoi). That Fesus Christ cometh in 
the flesh (Iésoun Christon erchomenon en sarki). “Jesus 
Christ coming in the flesh.” Present middle participle of 
erchomai treating the Incarnation as a continuing fact which 
the Docetic Gnostics flatly denied. In I John 4:2 we have 
eléluthota (perfect active participle) in this same construc- 
tion with homologed, because there the reference is to the 
definite historical fact of the Incarnation. There is no allu- 
sion here to the second coming of Christ. This (houtos). 
See I John 2:18, 22; 5:6, 20. The deceiver and the antichrist — 
(ho planos kai ho antichristos). Article with each word, as 
in Rey. 1:17, to bring out sharply each separate phrase, 
though one individual is referred to. The one par excellence 
in popular expectation (I John 2:22), though many in reality 
(I John 2:18; III John 7). 

8. Look to yourselves (blepete heautous). Imperative ac- 
tive with reflexive pronoun as in Mark 13:9. The verb 
often used absolutely (Phil. 3:2) like our “look out.” That 
ye lose not (hina mé apoleséte). Negative purpose with hina 
mé and first aorist active subjunctive of apollumi. This is 
the correct text (B), not apolesomen (we). Likewise apola- 
bete (that ye receive), not apolabomen (we). Which we have 
wrought (ha érgasametha). This is also correct, first aorist 
middle indicative of ergazomai, to work (John 6:27f.). John 
does not wish his labour to be lost. See Rom. 1:27 for this 
use of apolamband for receiving. See John 4:36 for misthos 
in the harvest. The “full reward” (misthon pléré) is the 
full day’s wages which each worker will get (I Cor. 3:8). 
John is anxious that they shall hold on with him to the 
finish. 

9. Whosoever goeth onward (pas ho proagin). “Every one 
who goes ahead. Proagé literally means to go on before 


254 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(Mark 11:9). That in itself is often the thing to do, but 
here the bad sense comes out by the parallel clause. And 
abideth not in the teaching of Christ (kai mé menon en téi 
didachéi tou Christou). Not the teaching about Christ, but 
that of Christ which is the standard of Christian teaching 
as the walk of Christ is the standard for the Christian’s 
walk (I John 2:6). See John 7:16; 18:19. These Gnostics 
claimed to be the progressives, the advanced thinkers, and 
were anxious to relegate Christ to the past in their onward 
march. This struggle goes on always among those who 
approach the study of Christ. Is he a “landmark” merely 
or is he our goal and pattern? Progress we all desire, but 
progress toward Christ, not away from him. Reactionary 
obscurantists wish no progress toward Christ, but desire to 
stop and camp where they are. “True progress includes 
the past” (Westcott). Jesus Christ is still ahead of us all 
calling us to come on to him. 

10. If any one cometh and bringeth not (ei tis erchetai kai 
ou pherei). Condition of first class with ei and two present 
indicatives (erchetai, pherei). This teaching (tautén tén dida- 
chén). This teaching of Christ of verse 9, which is the stand- 
ard by which to test Gnostic deceivers (verse 7). John does 
not refer to entertaining strangers (Heb. 13:2; I Tim. 5:10), 
but to the deceiving propagandists who were carrying dis- 
sension and danger with them. Receive him not (mé lam- 
banete auton). Present active imperative with mé. For 
lambané in this sense see John 1:12; 6:21; 13:20. Into your 
house (eis oikian). Definite without the article like our at 
home, to town. Give him no greeting (chairein autoi mé 
legete). ““Say not farewell to him.”- Apparently chairein 
here (present active infinitive, object of /egete present active 
imperative with negative mé) is used of farewell as in II 
Cor. 13:11, though usually in the N.T. (Acts 15:23; 23:26; 
James 1:1) of the salutation. But here the point turns on 
the stranger bringing into the house (or trying to do so) 


SECOND EPISTLE OF JOHN S25 


his heretical and harmful teaching which seems to be after 
the salutation is over. The usual greeting to a house is 
given in Luke 10:5. On the other hand, if chairein means 
greeting, not farewell, here, it can very well be understood 
of the peril of allowing these Gnostic propagandists to 
spread their pernicious teachings (cf. Mormons or Bolshe- 
vists) in home and church. (usually meeting in the home). 
This is assuming that the men were known and not mere 
strangers. 

11. Partaketh in his evil works (koinonei tois ergois autou 
tois ponérois). Associative instrumental case with koindnet 
as in I Tim. 5:22, common verb from koinonos (partner). 
It is to be borne in mind that the churches often met in 
private homes (Rom. 16:5; Col. 4:15), and if these travelling 
deceivers were allowed to spread their doctrines in these 
homes and then sent on with endorsement as Apollos was 
from Ephesus to Corinth (Acts 18:27), there was no way 
of escaping responsibility for the harm wrought by these 
propagandists of evil. It is not a case of mere hospitality 
to strangers. 

12. I would not (ouk ebouléthén). Epistolary aorist (first 
passive indicative). With paper and ink (dia chartou kat 
melanos). ‘The chartés was a leaf of papyrus prepared for 
writing by cutting the pith into strips and pasting together, 
old word (Jer. 43:23), here only in N.T. Méelas is old ad- 
jective for black (Matt. 5:36; Rev. 6:5, 12), and for black 
ink here, III John 13; II Cor. 3:3. Apparently John wrote 
this little letter with his own hand. To come (genesthat). 
Second aorist middle infinitive of ginomai after elpiz0, I 
hope. Face to face (stoma pros stoma). “Mouth to mouth.” 
So in III John 14 and Numb. 12:8. “Face to face” (pros- 
dpon pros prosopon) we have in I Cor. 13:12. Your (humon). 
Or “our” (amon). Both true. That may be fulfilled (hina 
pepléromené 2). Purpose clause with hina and the peri- 


256 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


phrastic perfect passive subjunctive of p/érod, as in I John 
1:4, which see. 

13. Of thine elect sister (tés adelphés sou tes eklektés). Same 
word ek/ekté as in verse 1 and Rev. 17:4. Apparently chil- 
dren of a deceased sister of the lady of verse 1 who lived 
in Ephesus and whom John knew as members of his church 
there.

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


Certainly ITI John‘is addressed to an individual, not to 
a church, though which Gaius we do not know. There are 
three friends of Paul with this name; Gaius of Corinth (I 
Cor. 1:14), Gaius of Macedonia (Acts 19:29), Gaius of Derbe 
(Acts 20:4), but it is unlikely that this Gaius of Pergamum 
(Findlay would call him) is either of these, though the 
Apostolical Constitutions does identify him with Gaius of 
Derbe. It is possible that in III John g there is an allusion © 
to II John and, if so, then both letters went to individuals 
in the same church (one a loyal woman, the other a loyal 
man). Three persons are sharply sketched in III John 
(Gaius, Diotrephes, Demetrius). Gaius is the dependable 
layman in the church, Diotrephes the dominating official, 
Demetrius the kindly messenger from Ephesus with the 
letter, a vivid picture of early church life and missionary 
work. John is at Ephesus, the last of the apostles, and with 
an eagle’s eye surveys the work in Asia Minor. The same 
Gnostic deceivers are at work as in the other Johannine 
Epistles. Pergamum is described in Rev. 2:13 as the place 
“‘where Satan’s throne is.” 

1. The beloved (toi agapétoi). Four times in this short 
letter this verbal adjective is used of Gaius (here, 2, 5, 11). 
See II John 1 for the same phrase here, “whom I love in 
truth.” 

2. I pray (euchomai). Here only in John’s writings. See 
Rom. 9:3. In all things (peri panton). To be taken with 
euodousthai and like peri in I. Cor. 16:1, “concerning all 
things.” Thou mayest prosper (se euodousthai). Infinitive 
in indirect discourse (object infinitive) after euchomai, with 
accusative of general reference se (as to thee). Euodod is old 

259 


260 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


verb (from euodos, eu and hodos, prosperous in a journey), 
to have a good journey, to prosper, in LXX, in N.T. only 
this verse (twice), I Cor. 16:2; Rom. 1:10. Be in health 
(hugiainein). In Paul this word always means sound teach- 
ing (I Tim. 1:10; 6:3), but here and in Luke 5:31; 7:10; 
15:27, of bodily health. Brooke wonders if Gaius’ health 
had caused his friends anxiety. Even as thy soul prospereth 
(kathos euodoutai sou hé psuché). A remarkable comparison 
which assumes the welfare (present middle indicative of 
euodod) of his soul (psuché here as the principle of the higher 
life as in John 12:27, not of the natural life as in Matt. 6:25). 

3. I rejoiced greatly (echarén lian). As in II John 4 and 
Phil. 4:10, not epistolary aorist, but reference to his emo- 
tions at the good tidings about Gaius. When brethren came 
(erchomenon adelphin). Genitive absolute with present mid- 
dle participle of erchomai, and so with marturounton (bare 
witness, present active participle of martured). Present par- 
ticiple here denotes repetition, from time to time. To the 
truth (tet alétheiai). Dative case. “As always in the Johan- 
nine writings, ‘truth’ covers every sphere of life, moral, 
intellectual, spiritual” (Brooke). Even as thou walkest in 
truth (kathos su en alétheiai peripateis). “Thou” in contrast 
to Diotrephes (verse g) and others like him. On peripated 
see I John 1:6 and on en alétheiai see II John 4. 

4. Greater (meizoteran). A double comparative with -teros 
added to meizon, like our “‘lesser” and like mallon kreisson 
(more better) in Phil. 1:23. In Eph. 3:8 we have elachisto- 
teroi, a comparative on a superlative. Like forms occur in 
the vernacular papyri and even in Homer (cheiroteros, more 
worse) as also in Shakespeare. oy (charan). B reads 
charin (grace). Than this (touton). Ablative neuter plural 
after the comparative. To hear of (hina akoud). Object 
clause (epexegetic) with hina and akoud, the present active 
subjunctive (keep on hearing of) in apposition with souti».. 
Walking in truth (en alétheiai peripatounta). As in II John 


THIRD EPISTLE OF JOHN 261 


4, which see. By the use of tekna John may mean that 
Gaius is one of his converts (I Tim. 1:1). 

5. A faithful work (piston). Either thus or “thou makest 
sure,’ after an example in Xénophon quoted by Wettstein 
(potein pista) and parallel to kaina poied in Rev. 21:5. But 
It is not certain. In-whatsoever thou doest (ho ean ergasét). 
Indefinite relative with modal ean (=an) and the first aorist 
middle subjunctive of ergazomai. See Col. 3:23 for both 
poteo and ergazomai in the same sentence. And strangers 
withal (kai touto xenous). ‘And that too” (accusative of 
general reference as in I Cor. 6:6; Phil. 1:28; Eph. 2:8). 
This praise of hospitality (Rom. 12:13; I Pet. 4:9; 1 Tim. 3:2; 
§:10; Titus 1:8; Heb. 13:2) shows that in II John 10 John © 
has a peculiar case in mind. 

6. Before the church (endpion ekklesias). Public meeting as 
the anarthrous use of ekk/ésia indicates, like en ekklésiai in I 
Cor. 14:19, 35. Thou wilt do well (kalos poiéseis). Future 
active of poied with adverb kalds, a common polite phrase 
in letters (papyri) like our “‘please.” See also Acts 10:33; 
James 2:19; I Cor. 7:37f.; Phil. 4:14; II Pet. 1:19. To set 
forward on their journey (propempsas). First aorist active 
participle (simultaneous action) of propempd, to send for- 
ward, “sending forward,” old word, in N.T. in Acts 15:3; 
20:385 212531 Cor..16:6, 115-1] Cori1:16;:Rom. 15:24; Titue 
3:13. Worthily of God (axids tou theou). Precisely this 
phrase in I Thess. 2:12 and the genitive with ax70s also in 
Rom. 16:2; Phil. 1:27; Col. 1:10; Eph. 4:1. See John 13:20 
for Christ’s words on the subject. “Since they are God’s 
representatives, treat them as you would God” (Holtzmann). 
From Homer’s time (Od. XV. 74) it was customary to speed 
the parting guest, sometimes accompanying him, sometimes 
providing money and food. Rabbis were so escorted and 
Paul alludes to the same gracious custom in Rom. 15:24 
and Titus 3:13. 

7. For the sake of the Name (huper tou onomatos). The 


262 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


name of Jesus. See Acts 5:4; Rom. 1:5 for huper tou ono- 
matos and James 2:7 for the absolute use of “the name” as 
in I Pet. 4:16. ‘This name is in essence the sum of the 
Christian creed” (Westcott) as in I Cor. 12:3; Rom. 10:9. 
It is like the absolute use of “the Way” (Acts 9:2; 19:9, 233 
24:22). Taking nothing (méden lambanontes). Present active 
participle with the usual negative with participles (I John 
2:4). Of the Gentiles (apo ton ethnikon). Instead of the usual 
ethnon (Luke 2:32), late adjective for what is peculiar to a 
people (ethnos) and then for the people themselves (Polyb- 
ius, Diodorus, not in LXX), in N.T. only here, Matt. 5:47; 
6:7; 18:17. Like our heathen, pagan. John is anxious that 
Christian missionaries receive nothing from the heathen, as 
our missionaries have to watch against the charge of being 
after money. There were many travelling lecturers out for 
money. Paul in I Cor. g defends the right of preachers to 
pay, but refuses himself to accept it from Corinth because 
it would be misunderstood (cf. I Thess. 2:6ff.; II Cor. 12:16ff. 
12:16ff.). Note apo here as in collecting taxes (Matt. 17:25) 
rather than para, which may be suggestive. 

8. Ought (opheilomen). See for this word I John 2:6; 3:16; 
4:11. To welcome (hupolambanein). Present active infinitive 
(habit of welcoming) of hupolambané, old word, to take up 
under, to carry off (Acts 1:9), to reply (Luke 10:30), to 
suppose (Acts 2:15), only here in N.T. in this sense of receiv- 
ing hospitably or to take under one’s protection like Aupo- 
dechomai (Luke 10:38). Such (tous toioutous). “The such” ~ 
according to the Greek idiom (I Cor. 16:16, 18). That we 
may be (hina gindmetha). Purpose clause with hina and the 
present middle subjunctive of ginomai, “that we may keep 
on becoming.” Fellow-workers (sunergoi). Old compound 
(sun, ergon). With the truth (téi alétheiai). So associative 
instrumental case with sun in sunergoi, but it is not certain 
that this is the idea, though suzerged is so used with ergois 
in James 2:22. Swnergos itself occurs with the genitive of 


THIRD EPISTLE OF JOHN 263 


the person as in theou sunergoi (I Cor. 3:9) or with genitive 
of the thing ¢és charas (I Cor. 3:9). So then here the meaning 
may be either “co-workers with such brethren for the truth” 
(dative of advantage) or “‘co-workers with the truth” (asso- 
ciative instrumental case). 

g. I wrote somewhat unto the church (egrapsa ti téi ekklesiat). 
A few MSS. add az to indicate that he had not written (con- 
clusion of second-class condition), clearly spurious. Not 
epistolary aorist nor a reference to II John as Findlay holds, 
but an allusion to a brief letter of commendation (Acts 18:27; 
II Cor. 3:1; Col. 4:10) sent along with the brethren in verses 
§ to 7 or to some other itinerant brethren. Westcott wrongly 
thinks that fi is never used of anything important in the — 
N.T. (Acts 8:9; Gal. 6:3), and hence that this lost letter 
was unimportant. It may have been brief and a mere intro- 
duction. Diotrephes (Dios and trephé, nourished by Zeus). 
This ambitious leader and sympathiser with the Gnostics 
would probably prevent the letter referred to being read to 
the church, whether it was II John condemning the Gnostics 
or another letter commending Demetrius and John’s mis- 
sionaries. Hence he sends Gaius this personal letter warning 
against Diotrephes. Who loveth to have the preéminence among 
them (ho philoproteuon auton). Present active articular par- 
ticiple of a late verb, so far found only here and in ecclesi- 
astical writers (the example cited by Blass being an error, 
Deissmann, Light etc., p. 76), from philoprotos, fond of being 
first (Plutarch), and made like philoponed (papyri), to be 
fond of toil. This ambition of Diotrephes does not prove 
that he was a bishop over elders, as was true in the second 
century (as Ignatius shows). He may have been an elder 
(bishop) or deacon, but clearly desired to rule the whole 
church. Some forty years ago I wrote an article on Diotre- 
phes for a denominational paper. The editor told me that 
twenty-five deacons stopped the paper to show their resent- 
ment against being personally attacked in the paper. Ke- 


264 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


ceiveth us not (ouk epidechetai hémas). Present active indica- 
tive of this old compound, in N.T. only here and verse Io. 
Diotrephes refused to accept John’s authority or those who 
sided with him, John’s missionaries or delegates (cf. Matt. 
10:40). 

10. If I come (ean eltho).. Condition of third class with 
ean and second aorist active subjunctive of erchomai. He 
hopes to come (verse 14), as he had said in II John 12 (one 
argument for identifying II John with the letter in III 
John 9). JI will bring to remembrance (hupomnéso). Future 
active indicative of hupomimnéskod, old compound (John 
14:26; II Pet. 1:12). The aged apostle is not afraid of 
Diotrephes and here defies him. Which he doeth (ha poiei). 
Present active indicative, “which he keeps on doing.” 
Prating against us (phluaron hémas). Present active parti- 
ciple of old verb (from phluaros, babbling I Tim. 5:13), to 
accuse idly and so falsely, here only in N.T. with accusative 
hémas (us). With wicked words (logois ponérois). Instru- 
mental case. Not simply foolish chatter, but malevolent 
words. Not content (mé arkoumenos). Present passive par- 
ticiple of arked with usual negative mé. For this verb in 
this sense see I Tim. 6:8 and Heb. 13:5, only there epi is 
absent. John knows that the conduct of Diotrephes will 
not stand the light. See Paul’s threats of exposure (I Cor. 
4:21; II Cor. 10:11; 13:1-3). And John is the apostle of 
love all the same. He himself (autos). That was bad enough. 
Them that would (tous boulomenous). “Those willing or wish- | 
ing or receive the brethren” from John. He forbiddeth 
(koluei). “‘He hinders.” Present active indicative of kolud 
and means either actual success in one case (punctiliar use 
of the present indicative) or repetition in several instances 
(linear action) or conative action attempted, but not suc- 
cessful as in Matt. 3:14 (this same verb) and John 10:32. 
Casteth them out of the church (ek tés ekklésias ekballei). Were 
again ekballei can be understood in various ways, like ko/uei. 


THIRD EPISTLE OF JOHN 265 


This verb occurs in John 2:15 for casting out of the temple 
the profaners of it and for casting the blind man out of the 
synagogue (John 9:34f.). If this ancient “church-boss” did 
not succeed in expelling John’s adherents from the church, 
he certainly tried to do it. 

11. [mitate not (mé mimou). Present middle imperative in 
prohibition (do not have the habit of imitating) of mimeomai 
(from mimos, actor, mimic), old word, in N.T. only here, 
II Thess. 3:7, 9; Heb. 13:7. That which is evil (to kakon). 
“The bad,” as in Rom. 12:21 (neuter singular abstract). 
But that which is good (alla to agathon). “But the good.” 
As in Rom. 12:21 again. Probably by the contrast between 
Diotrephes and Demetrius. He that doeth good (ho agatho- ~ 
poidn). Articular present active participle of agathopoied, 
late and rare verb, in contrast with ho kakopoion (old and 
common verb) as in Mark 3:4; Luke 6:9; I Pet. 3:17. Js of 
God (ek tou theou estin). Asin I John 3:9f. Hath not seen 
God (ouch heoraken ton theon). As in I John 3:6. He 
does not say ek tou diabolou as Jesus does in John 8:44, but 
he means it. 

12. Demetrius hath the witness of all men (Démétriot memar- 
turétai hupo panton). Perfect passive indicative of martureo, 
“it has been witnessed to Demetrius (dative case) by all.” 
We know nothing else about him, unless, as is unlikely, he be 
identified with Demas as a shortened form (Philemon 24; 
Col. 4:4; II Tim. 4:10), who has come back after his desertion 
or with the Ephesian silversmith (Acts 19:21ff.), who may 
have been converted under John’s ministry, which one would 
like to believe, though there is no evidence for it. He may 
indeed be the bearer of this letter from Ephesus to Gaius and 
may also have come under suspicion for some reason and 
hence John’s warm commendation. And of the truth itself (kat 
hupo autés tés alétheias). A second commendation of Deme- 
trius. It is possible, in view of I John 5:6 (the Spirit is the 
truth), that John means the Holy Spirit and not a mere 


266 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


personification of the truth. Yea we also (kai hémeis de). A 
third witness to Demetrius, that is John himself (literary 
plural). Thou knowest (oidas). “The words in John 21:24 
sound like an echo of this sentence” (Westcott). John 
knew Demetrius well in Ephesus. 

13. I had (eichon). Imperfect active of echd, when I 
began to write (grapsai, ingressive aorist active infinitive of 
grapho). I am unwilling to write (ou thelo graphein). ‘1 do 
not wish to go on writing them. With ink and pen (dia 
melanos kai kalamou), ‘by means of (dia) black (ink) and 
reed (used as pen).” See II John 12 for melanos and Matt. 
11:7 for kalamos, used for papyrus and parchment, as 
grapheion (a sharp stilus) for wax tablets. 

14. I hope (elpizd)—We shall speak (lalésomen). Literary 
plural really singular like e/pizd. Face to face (stoma pros 
stoma). As in II John 12. 

15. Peace to thee (eirené soi). Pax tibi like the Jewish 
greeting shalom (Luke 10:5; 24:36; John 20:19, 21). The 
friends (hoi philoi). Those in Ephesus. By name (kat’ 
onoma). John knew the friends in the church (at Pergamum 
or wherever it was) as the good shepherd calls his sheep by 
name (John 10:3, the only other N.T. example of kag’ 
onoma). ‘The idiom is common in the papyri letters (Deiss- 
mann, Light, etc., p. 193, note 21).

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


DIFFICULTY IN THE PROBLEM 


Perhaps no single book in the New Testament presents so 
many and so formidable problems as the Apocalypse of John. 
These difficulties concern the authorship, the date, the 
apocalyptic method, the relation to the other Johannine 
books, the purpose, the historical environment, the reception 
of the book in the New Testament canon, the use and misuse 
of the book through the ages, etc. In the eastern churches 
the recognition of the Apocalypse of John was slower than 
in the west, since it was not in the Peshitta Syriac Version. 
Caius of Rome attributed the book to Cerinthus the Gnostic, 
but he was ably answered by Hippolytus, who attributed it 
to the Apostle John. The Council of Laodicea (about a.p. 
360) omitted it, but the third Council of Carthage (a.p. 397) 
accepted it. The dispute about millenarianism led Dionysius 
of Alexandria (middle of the third century, a.p.) to deny the 
authorship to the Apostle John, though he accepted it as 
canonical. Eusebius suggested a second John as the author. 
But finally the book was accepted in the east as Hebrews 
was in the west after a period of doubt. 


Poor STATE OF THE TEXT 


There are only five uncials that give the text of John’s 
Apocalypse (Aleph AC PQ). Of these Aleph belongs to the 
fourth century, A and C to the fifth, Q (really Bz, B ending 
with Heb. 9:13, both in the Vatican Library) to the eighth, 
P to the ninth. Only Aleph A Q (= B,) are complete, 
Crlacla nee sr 519 21955614507 FAH 17 5> 885-921 Og Os1OTI 13; 
14:13-18:2, 19:5-21, P lacking 16:12-17:1, 19:21-20:9, 

269 


270 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


22:6-21. Both C and P are palimpsests. In the 400 verses 
of the book ‘‘over 1,600 variants have been counted” 
(Moffatt). Erasmus had only one cursive (of the twelfth cen- 
tury numbered 1°) for his first edition, and the last six verses 
of the Apocalypse, save verse 20, were a translation from the 
Vulgate. The result is that the versions are of special im- 
portance for the text of the book, since in no single MS. or 
group of MSS. do we have a fairly accurate text, though 
Aleph A C and A C Vulgate are the best two groups. 


THE APOCALYPTIC STYLE 


The book claims to be an apocalypse (1:1) and has to be 
treated as such. It is an unveiling (apokalupsis, from 
apokalupto) or revelation of Jesus Christ, a prophecy, in 
other words, of a special type, like Ezekiel, Zechariah, and 
Daniel in the Old Testament. There was a considerable 
Jewish apocalyptic literature by this time when John wrote, 
much of it B.c., some of it a.D., like the Book of Enoch, the 
Apocalypse of Baruch, the Book of Jubilees, the Assumption 
of Moses, the Psalms of Solomon, the Testaments of the 
Twelve Patriarchs, the Sibylline Oracles, some of them evi- 
dently “worked over by Christian hands” (Swete). Jesus 
himself used the apocalyptic style at times (Mark 13 = Matt. 
24 and 25 =Luke 21). Paulin I Cor. 14 spoke of the unpre- 
meditated apocalyptic utterances in the Christian meetings 
and suggested restraints concerning them. “The Revela-_ 
tion of John is the only written apocalypse, as it is the only 
written prophecy of the Apostolic age. . . . The first Chris- 
tian apocalypse came on the crest of this long wave of 
apocalyptic effort” (Swete). The reason for this style of 
writing is usually severe persecution and the desire to deliver 
a message in symbolic form. The effort of Antiochus 
Epiphanes, who claimed to be “‘a god manifest,” to hellenize 
the Jews aroused violent opposition and occasioned many 
apocalypses to cheer the persecuted Jews.

Emperor Worsuip as THE Occasion FOR JOHN’s 
APOCALYPSE 


There is no doubt at all that the emperor cult (emperor 
worship) played a main part in the persecution of the 
Christians that was the occasion for this great Christian 
apocalypse. The book itself bears ample witness to this 
fact, if the two beasts refer to the Roman power as the 
agent of Satan. It is not possible to single out each in- 
dividual emperor in the graphic picture. Most would take 
the dragon to be Satan and the first and the second beasts 
to be the imperial and provincial Roman power. The 
Roman emperors posed as gods and did the work of Satan. 
In particular there were two persecuting emperors (Nero 
and Domitian) who were responsible for many martyrs for 
Christ. But emperor worship began before Nero. Julius 
Cesar was worshipped in the provinces. Octavius was called 
Augustus (Sedastos, Reverend). The crazy Emperor Caius 
Caligula not simply claimed to be divine, but actually de- 
manded that his statue be set up for worship in the Holy 
of Holies in the Temple in Jerusalem. He was killed in 
January a.p. 41 before he could execute his dire purpose. 
But the madcap Nero likewise demanded worship and 
blamed in a.p. 64 the burning of Rome on the Christians, 
though guilty of it himself. He set the style for persecuting 
Christians, which slumbered on and burst into flames again 
under Domitian, who had himself commonly termed Dom- 
inus ac Deus noster (Our Lord and God). The worship of 
the emperor did not disturb the worshippers of other gods 
save the Jews and the Christians, and in particular the 
Christians were persecuted after the burning of Rome when 
they were distinguished from the Jews. Up till then Chris- 
tians were regarded (as by Gallio in Corinth) as a variety 
of Jews and so entitled to tolerance as a religio licita, but 
they had no standing in law by themselves and their re- 


272 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


fusal to worship the emperor early gave offence, as Paul 
indicates in I Cor. 12:3. It was Kurios Ié@sous or Kurios 
Kaisar. On this very issue Polycarp lost his life. The em- 
perors as a rule were tolerant about it, save Nero and 
Domitian, who was called Nero redivivous, or Nero back 
again. Trajan in his famous letter to Pliny advised toler- 
ance except in stubborn cases, when the Christians had to 
be put to death. After Nero it was a crime to be a Chris- 
tian and all sorts of slanders about them were circulated. 
We have seen already in II Thess. 2:3ff., the man of sin 
who sets himself above God as the object of worship. We 
have seen also in I John 2:18, 22; 4:3; II John 7 the term 
antichrist applied apparently to Gnostic heretics. One may 
wonder if, as Beckwith argues, in the Apocalypse the man 
of sin and the antichrist are united in the beast. 


THe AUTHOR 


The writer calls himself John (1:1, 4, 9; 22:8). But what 
John? The book can hardly be pseudonymous, though, 
with the exception of the Shepherd of Hermas, that is the 
rule with apocalypses. There would have been a clearer 
claim than just the name. The traditional and obvious 
way to understand the name is the Apostle John, though 
Dionysius of Alexandria mentions John Mark as held by 
some and he himself suggests another John, like the so- 
called Presbyter John of Papias as quoted by Eusebius. 
The uncertain language of Papias has raised a deal of ques- 
tioning. Swete thinks that the majority of modern critics 
ascribe the Apocalypse to this Presbyter John, to whom 
Moffatt assigns probably II and II -John. Irenzus repre- 
sents the Apostle John as having lived to the time of Trajan, 
at least to a.D. 98. Most ancient writers agree with this 
extreme old age of John. Justin Martyr states expressly 
that the Apostle John wrote the Apocalypse. Irenzus called 
it the work of a disciple of Jesus. In the ninth century lived 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION a78 


Georgius Hamartolus, and a MS. of his alleges that Papias 
says that John the son of Zebedee was beheaded by the 
Jews and there is an extract in an Oxford MS. of the 
seventh century which alleges that Papias says John and 
James were put to death by the Jews. On the basis of this 
slim evidence some today argue that John did not live to 
the end of the century and so did not write any of the 
Johannine books. But a respectable number of modern 
scholars still hold to the ancient view that the Apocalypse 
of John is the work of the Apostle and Beloved Disciple, 
the son of Zebedee. 


RELATION TO THE FourTH GOSPEL 


Here scholars divide again. Many who deny the Johan- 
nine authorship of the Fourth Gospel and the Epistles ac- 
cept the apostolic authorship of the Apocalypse, Baur, for 
instance. Hort, Lightfoot, and Westcott argued for the 
Johannine authorship on the ground that the Apocalypse 
was written early (time of Nero or Vespasian) when John 
did not know Greek so well as when the Epistles and the 
Gospel were written. There are numerous grammatical 
laxities in the Apocalypse, termed by Charles a veritable 
grammar of its own. They are chiefly retention of the 
nominative case in appositional words or phrases, particu- 
larly participles, many of them sheer Hebraisms, many of 
them clearly intentional (as in Rev. 1:4), all of them on 
purpose according to Milligan (Revelation in Schaff’s Pop. 
Comm.) and Heinrici (Der Litterarische Charakter der neutest. 
Schriften, p. 85). Radermacher (Neutestamentliche Gram- 
matik, p. 3) calls it “the most uncultured literary production 
that has come down to us from antiquity,” and one finds 
frequent parallels to the linguistic peculiarities in later illit- 
erate papyri. J. H. Moulton (Grammar, Vol. II, Part I, 
Pp. 3) says: “Its grammar is perpetually stumbling, its idiom 
is that of a foreign language, its whole style that of a writer 


274 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


who neither knows nor cares for literary form.” But we 
shall see that the best evidence is for a date in Domitian’s 
reign and not much later than the Fourth Gospel. It is 
worth noting that in Acts 4:13 Peter and John are both 
termed by the Sanhedrin agrammatoi kai idiotai (unlettered 
and unofficial men). We have seen the possibility that II 
Peter represents Peter’s real style or at least that of a 
different amanuensis from Silvanus in I Pet. 5:12. It seems 
clear that the Fourth Gospel underwent careful scrutiny and 
possibly by the elders in Ephesus (John 21:24). If John 
wrote the Apocalypse while in Patmos and so away from 
Ephesus, it seems quite possible that here we have John’s 
own uncorrected style more than in the Gospel and Epistles. 
There is also the added consideration that the excitement 
of the visions played a part along with a certain element of 
intentional variations from normal grammatical sequence. 
An old man’s excitement would bring back his early style. 
There are numerous coincidences in vocabulary and style 


between the Fourth Gospel and the Apocalypse. 


Tue Unity oF THE APOCALYPSE 


Repeated efforts have been made to show that the Apoca- 
lypse of John is not the work of one man, but a series of 
Jewish and Christian apocalypses pieced together in a more 
or less bungling fashion. Spitta argued for this in 1889. 
Vischer was followed by Harnack in the view there was a | 
Jewish apocalypse worked over by a Christian. Gunkel 
(Creation and Chaos, 1895) argued for a secret apocalyptic 
tradition of Babylonian origin. In 1904 J. Weiss carried 
on the argument for sources behind the Apocalypse. Many 
of the Jewish apocalypses do show composite authorship. 
There was a current eschatology which may have been 
drawn on without its being a written source. It is in chap- 
ter 12 where the supposed Jewish source is urged more 
vigorously about the woman, the dragon, and the man 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 275 


child. There are no differences in language (vocabulary or 
grammar) that argue for varied sources. The author may 
indeed make use of events in the reign of Nero as well as 
in the reign of Domitian, but the essential unity of the book 
has stood the test of the keenest criticism. 


THE DaTE 


There are two chief theories, the Neronic, soon after 
Nero’s death, the other in the reign of Domitian. Irenzeus 
is quoted by Eusebius as saying expressly that the Apoca- 
lypse of John was written at the close of the reign of Domi- 
tian. This testimony is concurred in by Clement of Alex- 
andria, by Origen, by Eusebius, by Jerome. In harmony 
with this clear testimony the severity of the persecutions 
suit the later date better than the earlier one. There is, 
besides, in Rev. 17:11f. an apparent reference to the story 
that Nero would return again. The fifth king who is one 
of the seven is an eighth. There was a Nero legend, to be 
sure, that Nero either was not dead but was in Parthia, or 
would be redivivus after death. Juvenal termed Domitian 
“a bald Nero” and others called Domitian “a second Nero.” 
But in spite of all this Hort, Lightfoot, Sanday, Westcott 
have argued strongly for the Neronic era. Peake is willing 
to admit allusions to the Neronic period as Swete is also, 
but both consider the Domitianic date the best supported. 
Moffatt considers any earlier date than Domitian “almost 
impossible.” 


Tue VISIONS 


No theory of authorship, sources, or date should ignore 
the fact that the author claims to have had a series of visions 
in Patmos. It does not follow that he wrote them down at 
once and without reflection, but it seems hardly congruous 
to think that he waited till he had returned from exile in 
Patmos to Ephesus before writing them out. In fact, there 


276 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


is a note of sustained excitement all through the book, 
combined with high literary skill in the structure of the 
book in spite of the numerous grammatical lapses. The 
series of sevens bear a relation to one another, but more in 
the fashion of a kaleidoscope than of a chronological pano- 
rama. And yet there is progress and power in the arrange- 
ment and the total effect. There is constant use of Old 
Testament language and imagery, almost a mosaic, but 
without a single formal quotation. There is constant repeti- 
tion of words and phrases in true Johannine style. Each of 
the messages to the seven churches picks out a metaphor in 
the first picture of Christ in chapter 1 and there are frequent 
other allusions to the language in this picture. In fact 
there is genuine artistic skill in the structure of the book, 
in spite of the deflections from ordinary linguistic standards. 
In the visions and all through the book there is constant 
use of symbols, as is the fashion in apocalypses like the 
beasts, the scorpions, the horses, etc. These symbols prob- 
ably were understood by the first readers of the book, 
though the key to them is lost to us. Even the numbers in 
the book (314, 7, 3, 4, 12, 24, 1000) cannot be pressed, though 
some do so. Even Harnack called the Apocalypse the 
plainest book in the New Testament, by using Harnack’s 
key for the symbols. 


THEORIES OF INTERPRETATION 


They are literally many. There are those who make the 
book a chart of Christian and even of human history even 
to the end. These divide into two groups, the continuous 
and the synchronous. The continuous historical theory 
takes each vision and symbol in succession as an unfolding 
panorama. Under the influence of this theory there have 
been all sorts of fantastic identifications of men and events. 
The synchronous theory takes the series of sevens (seals, 
trumpets, bowls) as parallel with each other, each time 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 277 


going up to the end. But in neither case can any satis- 
factory program be arranged. Another historical interpre- 
tation takes it all as over and done, the preterist theory. 
This theory again breaks into two, one finding the fulfil- 
ment all in the Neronic period, the other in the Domitianic 
era. Something can be said for each view, but neither satis- 
fies the whole picture by. any means. Roman Catholic 
scholars have been fond of the preterist view to escape the 
Protestant interpretation of the second beast in chapter 13 
as papal Rome. There is still another interpretation, the 
futurist, which keeps the fulfilment all in the future and 
which can be neither proved nor disproved. There is also 
the purely spiritual theory which finds no historical allusion 
anywhere. This again can be neither proved nor disproved. 
One of the lines of cleavage is the millennium in chapter 20. 
Those who take the thousand years literally are either pre- 
millennialists who look for the second coming of Christ to 
be followed by a thousand years of personal reign here on 
earth or the postmillennialists who place the thousand years 
before the second coming. There are others who turn to 
II Pet. 3:8 and wonder if, after all, in a book of symbols 
this thousand years has any numerical value at all. There 
seems abundant evidence to believe that this apocalypse, 
written during the stress and storm of Domitian’s persecu- 
tion, was intended to cheer the persecuted Christians with 
a view of certain victory at last, but with no scheme of 
history in view. 


A PractTicaAL PuRPOSE 


So considered, this vision of the Reigning Christ in heaven 
with a constant eye on the suffering saints and martyrs is a 
guarantee of certain triumph in heaven and ultimate triumph 
on earth. The picture of Christ in heaven is a glorious one. 
He is the Lamb that was slain, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, 
the Word of God, the Victor over his enemies, worshipped in 


278 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


heaven like the Father, the Light and Life of men. Instead 
of trying to fit the various symbols on particular individuals 
one will do better to see the same application to times of 
persecution from time to time through the ages. The 
same Christ who was the Captain of salvation in the time of 
Domitian is the Pioneer and Perfecter of our faith today. 
The Apocalypse of John gives glimpses of heaven as well as 
of hell. Hope is the word that it brings to God’s people at 


all times. 


THE READERS OF THE Book 


The whole book is sent to the seven churches in Asia (1:4). 
There is a special message to each of the seven (chapters 2 
and 3), suited to the peculiar needs of each church and witha 
direct reference to the geography and history of each church 
and city, so Ramsay holds (The Letters to the Seven Churches). 
The book is to be read aloud in each church (1:3). One can 
imagine the intense interest that the book would arouse in 
each church. Children are charmed to hear the Apocalypse 
read. They do not understand the symbols, but they see 
the pictures in the unfolding panorama. There were other 
churches in the Province of Asia besides these seven, but 
these form a circle from Ephesus where John had lived and 
wrought. They do present a variety of churches, not 
necessarily all types, and by no means a chart of seven dis- 
pensations of Christian history.

CHAPTER I 


1. The Revelation (apokalupsis). Late and rare word out- 
_ side of N.T. (once in Plutarch and so in the vernacular 
Koiné), only once in the Gospels (Luke 2:32), but in LXX 
and common in the Epistles (II Thess. 1:7), though only 
here in this book besides the title, from apokalupto, old verb, 
to uncover, to unveil. In the Epistles apokalupsis is used 
for insight into truth (Eph. 1:17) or for the revelation of 
God or Christ at the second coming of Christ (II Thess. 1:7; 
I Pet. 1:7). It is interesting to compare apokalupsis with 
epiphaneia (II Thess. 2:8) and phanerosis (I Cor. 12:7). The 
precise meaning here turns on the genitive following. Of 
Fesus Christ ([ésou Christou). Hort takes it as objective 
genitive (revelation about Jesus Christ), but Swete rightly 
argues for the subjective genitive because of the next clause. 
Gave him (edoken autoi). It is the Son who received the 
revelation from the Father, as is usual (John §:20f., 26, etc.). 
To shew (deixai). First aorist active infinitive of deiknumi, — 
purpose of God in giving the revelation to Christ. Unto his — 
servants (tois doulois autou). Believers in general and not 
just to officials. Dative case. God’s servants (or Christ’s). 
Must shortly come to pass (dei genesthai en tachei). Second 
aorist middle infinitive of ginomai with dei. See this same 
adjunct (en tachei) in Luke 18:8; Rom. 16:20; Rev. 22:6. 
It is a relative term to be judged in the light of II Pet. 3:8 
according to God’s clock, not ours. And yet undoubtedly 
the hopes of the early Christians looked for a speedy return 
of the Lord Jesus. This vivid panorama must be read in 
the light of that glorious hope and of the blazing fires of 
persecution from Rome. Sent and signified (es¢manen apos- 
teilas). ‘‘Having sent (first aorist active participle of apo- 
283 


284 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


stello, Matt. 10:16 and again in Rev. 22:6 of God sending 
his angel) signified” (first aorist active indicative of s@maind, 
from séma, sign or token, for which see John 12:33; Acts 
11:28). See 12:1 for sémeion, though sémaino (only here in 
the Apocalypse) suits admirably the symbolic character of 
the book. By his angel (dia tou aggelou autou). Christ’s 
angel as Christ is the subject of the verb es@manen, as in 
22:16 Christ sends his angel, though in 22:6 God sends. 
Unto his servant Fohn (toi douloi autou Idanei). Dative case. 
John gives his name here, though not in Gospel or Epistles, 
because “‘prophecy requires the guarantee of the individual 
who is inspired to utter it” (Milligan). ‘‘The genesis of the 
Apocalypse has now been traced from its origin in the Mind 
of God to the moment when it reached its human inter- 
preter” (Swete). ‘‘Jesus is the medium of all revelation” 
(Moffatt). 

2. Bare witness (emarturésen). First aorist active indica- 
tive of martured, which, along with martus and marturia, is 
common in all the Johannine books (cf. 22:18, 20), usually 
with peri or hoti, but with cognate accusative as here in 
22:16, 20; I John 5:10. Epistolary aorist here, referring to 
this book. The word of God (ton logon tou theou). Subjective 
genitive, given by God. The prophetic word as in 1:9; 6:9; 
20:4, not the personal Word as in 19:14. The testimony of 
Jesus Christ (tén marturian Tsou Christou). Subjective gen- 
itive again, borne witness to by Jesus Christ. Even of all 
the things that he saw (hosa eiden). Relative clause in appo- 
sition with Jogon and marturian. 

3. Blessed (makarios). As in Matt. 5:3ff. This endorses 
the book as a whole. He that readeth (ho anaginoskon). 
Present active singular articular participle of anagindsko (as 
in Luke 4:16). Christians in their public worship followed 
the Jewish custom of public reading of the Scriptures (II 
Cor, 3:14f.). The church reader (anagndstés, lector) gradu- 
ally acquired an official position. John expects this book to 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 285 


be read in each of the seven churches mentioned (1:4) and 
elsewhere. Today the public reading of the Bible is an 
important part of worship that is often poorly done. They 
that hear (hot akouontes). Present active plural articular 
participle of akoud (the audience). And keep (kai térountes). 
Present active participle of #@red, a common Johannine word 
(I John 2:4, etc.). Cf. Matt. 7:24. ‘‘The content of the 
Apocalypse is not merely prediction; moral counsel and re- 
ligious instruction are the primary burdens of its pages” 
(Moffatt). Written (gegrammena). Perfect passive parti- 
ciple of grapho. For the time is at hand (ho gar kairos eggus). 
Reason for listening and keeping. On kairos see Matt. 12:1, 
time of crisis as in I Cor. 7:29. How near eggus (at hand) 
is we do not know any more than we do about en tachei 
(shortly) in 1:1. 

4. To the seven churches which are in Asia (tais hepta ekkle- 
siais tais en tei Asiai). Dative case as in a letter (Gal. 1:1). 
John is writing, but the revelation is from God and Christ 
through an angel. It is the Roman province of Asia which 
included the western part of Phrygia. There were churches 
also at Troas (Acts 20:5ff.) and at Colossz and Hierapolis 
(Col.-1:1; 2:1; 4:13) and possibly at Magnesia and Tralles. 
But these seven were the best points of communication with 
seven districts (Ramsay) and, besides, seven is a favorite 
number of completion (like the full week) in the book (1:4, 12, 
163 4353 §:1, 6; 8:25 10:33 11:13; 12:3; 13:1; 14:6f.). From 
him which is (apo ho Gn). This use of the articular nomina- 
tive participle of eimi after apo instead of the ablative is not 
due to ignorance or a mere slip (/apsus pennae), for in the 
next line we have the regular idiom with apo ton hepta 
pneumaton. It is evidently on purpose to call attention to 
the eternity and unchangeableness of God. Used of God in 
Ex. 3:14. And which was (kai ho én). Here again there is 
a deliberate change from the articular participle to the rela- 
tive use of o (used in place of hos to preserve identity of 


286 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


form in the three instances like Ionic relative and since no 
aorist participle of eimi existed). The oracle in Pausanias 
X. 12 has it: Zeus én, Zeus esti, Zeus essetai (Zeus was, Zeus 
is, Zeus will be). Which is to come (ho erchomenos). “The 
Coming One,” futuristic use of the present participle instead 
of ho esomenos. See the same idiom in verse 8 and 4:8 and 
(without ho erchomenos) in 11:17; 16:5. From the seven 
Spirits (apo ton hepta pneumaton). A difficult symbolic rep- 
resentation of the Holy Spirit here on a par with God and 
Christ, a conclusion borne out by the symbolic use of the 
seven spirits in 3:1; 4:5; 5:6 (from Zech. 4:2-10). There is 
the one Holy Spirit with seven manifestations here to the 
seven churches (Swete, The Holy Spirit in the N.T., p. 374), 
unity in diversity (I Cor. 12:4). Which are (ton article 
Aleph A, ha relative P). Before his throne (endpion tou 
thronou autou). As in 4:6f. 

5. Who ts the faithful witness (ho martus ho pistos). “The 
witness the faithful,” nominative in apposition like proto- 
tokos and archon with the preceding ablative Jésou Christou 
with apo, a habit of John in this book (apparently on pur- 
pose) as in 2:13, 20; 3:12, etc. See this same phrase in 2:13; 
3:14. The use of martus of Jesus here is probably to the 
witness (1:1) in this book (22:16f.), not to the witness of 
Jesus before Pilate (I Tim. 6:13). The first-born of the dead 
(ho prototokos ton nekron). A Jewish Messianic title (Ps. 
88:28) and as in Col. 1:18 refers to priority in the resurrec- 
tion to be followed by others. See Luke 2:7 for the word. 
The ruler of the kings of the earth (ho archin ton basileon ts 
gés). Jesus by his resurrection won lordship over the kings 
of earth (17:14; 19:16), what the devil offered him by sur- 
render (Matt. 4:8f.). Unto him that loveth us (t0i agaponti 
hémas). Dative of the articular present (not aorist agapé- 
santi) active participle of agapad in a doxology to Christ, 
the first of many others to God and to Christ (1:6; GEL eStgy 
12f.; 7:10, 12, etc.). For the thought see John 3:16. Loosed 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 287 


(Jusanti). First aorist active participle of /ud (Aleph A C), 
though some MSS. (P Q) read /ousanti (washed), a manifest 
correction. Note the change of tense. Christ loosed us once 
for all, but loves us always. By his blood (en toi haimati 
autou). Asin §:9. John here as in the Gospel and Epistles 
states plainly and repeatedly the place of the blood of 
Christ in the work of redemption. 

6. And he made (kai epoiésen). Change from the par- 
ticiple construction, which would be kai poiésanti (first 
aorist active of poied) like /usanti just before, a Hebraism 
Charles calls it, but certainly an anacoluthon of which John 
is very fond, as in 1:18; 2:2, 9, 20; 3:95 7:14; 14:2f.5 15:3. 
Kingdom (basileian). So correctly Aleph A C, not dasilets 
(P cursives). Perhaps a reminiscence of Ex. 19:6, a kingdom 
of priests. In 5:10 we have again “a kingdom and priests.” 
The idea here is that Christians are the true spiritual Israel 
in God’s promise to Abraham as explained by Paul in Gal. 
3 and Rom. 9. To be priests (hiereis). In apposition with 
basileian, but with kai (and) in 5:10. Each member of this 
true kingdom is a priest unto God, with direct access to 
him at all times. Unto his God and Father (toi theoi kat 
patri autou). Dative case and autou (Christ) applies to 
both thedi and patri. Jesus spoke of the Father as his God 
(Matt. 27:46; John 20:17) and Paul uses like language (Eph. 
1:17), as does Peter (I Pet. 1:3). To him (autoi). Another 
doxology to Christ. ‘The adoration of Christ which vi- 
brates in this doxology is one of the most impressive fea- 
tures of the book” (Moffatt). Like doxologies to Christ 
appear in 5:13; 7:10; I Pet. 4:11; II Pet. 3:18; Il Tim. 4:18; 
Heb. 13:21. These same words (hé doxa kai to kratos) in 
I Pet. 4:11, only Aé doxa in II Pet. 3:18 and IL Tim. 4:18, 
but with several others in Rev. 5:13 and 7:10. 

7. Behold, he cometh with the clouds (idou erchetai meta ton 
nephelon). Futuristic present middle indicative of erchomai, 
a reminiscence of Dan. 7:13 (Theodotion). “It becomes a 


288 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


common eschatological refrain” (Beckwith) as in Mark 
13:26; 14:62; Matt. 24:30; 26:64; Luke 21:27. ‘‘Compare 
the manifestation of God in the clouds at Sinai, in the cloudy 
pillar, the Shekinah, at the transfiguration” (Vincent). Shall 
see (opsetai). Future middle of horad, a reminiscence of 
Zech. 12:10 according to the text of Theodotion (Aquila 
and Symmachus) rather than the LXX and like that of 
Matt. 24:30 (similar combination of Daniel and Zechariah) 
and 26:64. This picture of the victorious Christ in his 
return occurs also in 14:14, 18-20; I9:11-21; 20:7-10. And 
they which (kai hoitines). “And the very ones who,” Romans 
and Jews, all who shared in this act. Pierced (exekentésan). 
First aorist active indicative of ekkented, late compound 
(Aristotle, Polybius, LXX), from ek and kented (to stab, to 
pierce), in N.T., only here and John 19:37, in both cases 
from Zech. 12:10, but not the LXX text (apparently proof 
that John used the original Hebrew or the translation of 
Theodotion and Aquila). Shall mourn (kopsontai). Future 
middle (direct) of koptd, old verb, to cut, “they shall cut 
themselves,” as was common for mourners (Matt. Liskz3 
Luke 8:52; 23:27). From Zech. 12:12. See also Rev. 18:9. 
Tribes (phulai). Not just the Jewish tribes, but the spiritual 
Israel of Jews and Gentiles as in 7:4-8. No nation had then 
accepted Christ as Lord and Saviour, nor has any yet 
done so. 

8. The Alpha and the Omega (to Alpha kai to 0). The 
first and the last letters of the Greek alphabet, each with 
its own neuter (grammatical gender) article. This descrip- 
tion of the eternity of God recurs in 21:6 with the added 
explanation hé arché kai to telos (the Beginning and the End) 
and of Christ in 22:13 with the still further explanation ho 
protos kai ho eschatos (the First and the Last). This last 
phrase appears also in 1:17 and 2:8 without fo Alpha kai 
to O. The change of speaker here is unannounced, as in 
16:15; 18:20. Only here and a1:sf. is God introduced as 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 289 


the speaker. The eternity of God guarantees the prophecy 
just made. The Lord God (Kurios ho theos). ‘‘The Lord 
the God.”” Common phrase in Ezekiel (6:3, 11; 7:2, etc.) 
and in this book (4:8; 11:17; 15:3; 16:7; 19:6; 21:22). See 
1:4 and 4:8 for the triple use of ho, etc. to express the 
eternity of God. The Almighty (ho pantokrator). Late com- 
pound (pas and krated), in Cretan inscription and a legal 
papyrus, common in LXX and Christian papyri, in N.T. 
only in II Cor. 6:18 (from Jer. 38:35) and Rev. 1:85; 4:8; 
ERE PS WSepetbeps Laprigths.0 551212202) 

g. I Fohn (Ego Ioanés). So 22:8. In apocalyptic litera- 
ture the personality of the writer is always prominent to 
guarantee the visions (Dan. 8:1; 10:2). Partaker with you 
(sunkoinonos). See already I Cor. 9:23. “‘Co-partner with 
you” (Rom. 11:17). One article with adelphos and sun- 
koinénos unifying the picture. The absence of apostolos 
here does not show that he is not an apostle, but merely his 
self-effacement, as in the Fourth Gospel, and still more his 
oneness with his readers. So there is only one article (¢é) 
with shlipsei (tribulation), basileiai (kingdom), hupomonéi 
(patience), ideas running all through the book. Both the 
tribulation (see Matt. 13:21 for ¢hlipsis) and the kingdom 
(see Matt. 3:2 for dasileia) were present realities and called 
for patience (hupomoné being “the spiritual alchemy” ac- 
cording to Charles for those in the kingdom, for which see 
Luke 8:15; James 5:7). All this is possible only “in Jesus”’ 
(en Iésou), a phrase on a par with Paul’s common ex 
Christoi (in Christ), repeated in 14:13. Cf. 3:20 and II 
Thess. 3:5. Was (egenomén). Rather, “I came to be,” 
second aorist middle indicative of ginomai. In the isle that 
is called Patmos (en téi nésoi tei kaloumenét Patmoi). Patmos 
is a rocky sparsely settled island some ten miles long and 
half that wide, one of the Sporades group in the Aigean 
Sea, south of Miletus. The present condition of the island 
is well described by W. E. Geil in The Isle That Is Called 


290 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Patmos (1905). Here John saw the visions described in the 
book, apparently written while still a prisoner there in exile. 
For the word of God and the testimony of Fesus (dia ton logon 
tou theou kat ten marturian Iésou). The reason for (dia and 
the-accusative) John’s presence in Patmos, naturally as a 
result of persecution already alluded to, not for the purpose 
of preaching there or of receiving the visions. See verse 2 
for the phrase. 

10. [ was in the Spirit (egenomén en pneumati). Rather, 
“I came to be (as in 1:9) in the Spirit,” came into an ec- 
static condition as in Acts 1o:1of.; 22:17, not the normal 
spiritual condition (einai en pneumati, Rom. 8:9). On the 
Lord’s Day (en tei kuriakéi hémerai). Deissmann has proven 
(Bible Studies, p. 217f.; Light, etc., P- 357ff.) from inscrip- 
tions and papyri that the word kuriakos was in common 
use for the sense “imperial” as imperial finance and im- 
perial treasury and from papyri and ostraca that Aémera 
Sebasté (Augustus Day) was the first day of each month, 
Emperor’s Day on which money payments were made (cf. 
I Cor. 16:1f.). It was easy, therefore, for the Christians to 
take this term, already in use, and apply it to the first day 
of the week in honour of the Lord Jesus Christ’s resurrection 
on that day (Didache 14, Ignatius Magn. 9). In the N.T. 
the word occurs only here and I Cor. 11:20 (kuriakon deipnon 
the Lord’s Supper). It has no reference to Aémera kuriou 
(the day of judgment, II Pet. 3:10). Behind me (opisd 
mou). “The unexpected, overpowering entrance of the 
divine voice” (Vincent). Cf. Ezek. 3:12. Voice (phonén). 
Of Christ, as is plain in verses 12f. As of a trumpet (hos 
salpiggos). So in 4:1 referring to this. Saying (degousés). 
Present active participle genitive case agreeing with salpiggos 
rather than /egousan, accusative agreeing with phonéen. So 
on purpose, as is clear from 4:1, where /alousés also agrees 
with salpiggos. 

11, Write in a book (grapson eis biblion). First aorist ac- 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 2gt 


tive imperative of graphd for instantaneous action. The 
commission covers the whole series of visions which all grow 
out of this first vision of the Risen Christ. Send (pempson). 
First aorist active imperative of pempd. Part of the com- 
mission from Christ.. The names of the seven churches of 
1:4 are now given, and the particular message to each church 
comes in chapters 2 and 3 and in the same order, the geo- 
graphical order going north from Ephesus, then east and 
south to Laodicea. But apparently the whole book was to 
be read to each of the seven churches. It would probably 
also be copied at each church. 

12. To see the voice (blepein ten phonén). The voice put - 
for the person speaking. Having turned (epistrepsas). First 
aorist active participle of epistrephd, from which also epes- 
trepsa, just before, for which verb see Acts 15:36; 16:18, 
Seven golden candlesticks (hepta luchnias chrusas). See Matt. 
5:15 for /uchnia (lampstand). Symbols of the seven churches 
as explained in verse 20. See Ex. 25:35ff. for description 
of a seven-branched candlestick, but here the lampstands 
are separate. 

13. One like unto a son of man (homoion huion anthropou). 
Note accusative here with homoion (object of eidon) as in 
14:14 and not the associative-instrumental as is usual (1:15; 
4:3, 6). Charles holds that homoion here has the sense of hés 
(as) and compares 4:6 with 22:1 for proof. The absence of 
the article here shows also (Charles) that the idea is not 
“like the Son of man” for Christ is the Son of man. He is 
like ‘‘a son of man,” but nota man. Clothed (endedumenon). 
Perfect passive participle of endud, accusative case agreeing 
with homoion. A garment down to the foot (podéré). Old 
adjective podérés (from pous, foot, and aird), here only in 
N.T., accusative singular retained with the passive par- 
ticiple as often with verbs of clothing. Supply chitona or 
esthéta (garment). Girt about (periezodsmenon). Perfect pas- 
sive participle of perizonnumi, accusative singular agreeing 


292 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


with homoion. At the breasts (pros tois mastois). Old word 
for breasts of a woman (Luke 11:27; 23:29) and nipples of 
aman, as here. High girding like this was a mark of dignity 
as of the high priest (Josephus, 4nt. III. 7. 2). For pros 
with the locative see Mark 5:11. With a golden girdle 
(zonén chrusan). Accusative case again retained with the 
passive participle (verb of clothing). Note also chrusan 
(vernacular Koiné) rather than the old form, chrusén. 

14. 4s white wool (hos erion leukon). Erion (wool) in 
N.T. only here and Heb. 9:19, though old word. The per- 
son of the Lord Jesus is here described in language largely 
from Dan. 7:9 (the Ancient of Days). White as snow (hos 
chin). Just “as snow,” also in Dan. 7:9. In N.T. only 
here and Matt. 28:3. 4s a flame of fire (hos phlox puros). 
In Dan. 7:9 the throne of the Ancient of Days is phlox puros, 
while in Dan. 10:6 the eyes of the Ancient of Days are 
lampades puros (lamps of fire). See also 2:18 and 19:12 for 
this bold metaphor (like Heb. 1:7). 

15. Burnished brass (chalkolibanoi). Associative-instru- 
mental case after homoioi. This word has so far been found 
nowhere else save here and 2:18. Suidas defines it as an 
élecktron (amber) or a compound of copper and gold and 
silver (aurichalcum in the Latin Vulgate). It is in reality 
an unknown metal. ds if it had been refined (hos pepuro- 
menés). Perfect passive participle of purod, old verb, to 
set on fire, to glow, as in Eph. 6:16; Rev. 3:18. The fem- - 
inine gender shows that 4é chalkolibanos is referred to with 
tes chalkolibanou understood, for it does not agree in case 
with the associative-instrumental chalkolibandi just before. 
Some would call it a slip for pepuromendi as Aleph, and some 
cursives have it (taking chalkolibandi to be neuter, not 
feminine). But P Q read pepurdmenoi (masculine plural), 
a correction, making it agree in number and gender with 
podes (feet). In a furnace (en kamindi). Old word, in 
N.T. also 9:2; Matt. 13:42, 50. 4s the voice of many waters 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 293 


(hos phoné hudatoin polloin). So the voice of God in the 
Hebrew (not the LXX) of Ezek. 43:2. Repeated in 14:2; 
19:6. : 
16. And he had (kai echon). “And having,” present ac- 
tive participle of echd, loose use of the participle (almost like 
eiche, imperfect) and not in agreement with autou, genitive 
case. This is a common idiom in the book; a Hebraism, 
Charles calls it. In his right hand (en téi dexidi cheiri). For 
safe keeping as in John 10:28. Seven stars (asteras hepta). 
Symbols of the seven churches (verse 20), seven planets 
rather than Pleiades or any other constellation like the 
bear. Proceeded (ekporeuomené). Present middle participle - 
of ekporeuomai, old compound (Matt. 3:5) used loosely 
again like echon. A sharp two-edged sword (romphaia dis- 
tomos oxeia). “A sword two-mouthed sharp.” Romphaia 
(as distinct from machaira) is a long sword, properly a 
Thracian javelin, in N.T. only Luke 2:35 and Rev. 1:16; 
2:12; Heb. 4:12. See stoma used with machairés in Luke 
21:24 (by the mouth of the sword). Countenance (opsis). 
Old word (from op#d), in N.T. only here, John 7:24; 11:44. 
As the sun shineth (hos ho hélios phainei). Brachylogy, “as 
the sun when it shines.” For phainei see John 1:5. 

17. I fell (epesa). Late form for the old epeson (second 
aorist active indicative of piptd, to fall). Under the over- 
powering influence of the vision as in 19:10. He laid (eth- 
éken). First aorist active indicative of ‘ithémi. The act 
restored John’s confidence. Fear not (mé phobou). Cf. 
Luke 1:13 to Zacharias to give comfort. J am the first and 
the last (ego eimi ho protos kai ho eschatos). Used in Is. 
44:6 and 48:12 of God, but here, 2:8; 22:13 of Christ. dnd 
the Living One (kai ho zon). Present active articular par- 
ticiple of za0, another epithet of God common in the O.T. 
(Deut. 32:40; Is. 49:18, etc.) and applied purposely to 
Jesus, with which see John 5:26 for Christ’s own words 
about it. 


294 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


18. And I was dead (kai egenomén nekros). “And I be- 
came dead” (aorist middle participle of ginomai as in 1:9, 
10, definite reference to the Cross). J am alive (zon eimi). 
Periphrastic present active indicative, “I am living,” as 
the words ho zon just used mean. Forevermore (eis tous 
aionas ton aidnon). “‘Unto the ages of the ages,” a stronger 
expression of eternity even than in 1:6. The keys (tas kleis). 
One of the forms for the accusative plural along with 
kleidas, the usual one (Matt. 16:19). Of death and of Hades 
(tou thanatou kai tou haidou). Conceived as in Matt. 16:18 
as a prison house or walled city. The keys are the symbol 
of authority, as we speak of honouring one by giving him 
the keys of the city. Hades here means the unseen world 
to which death is the portal. Jesus has the keys because of 
his victory over death. See this same graphic picture in 
6:8; 20:13f. For the key of David see 3:7, for the key of 
the abyss see 9:1; 20:1. 

19. Therefore (oun). In view of Christ’s words about 
himself in verse 18 and the command in verse 11. Which 
thou sawest (ha eides). The vision of the Glorified Christ 
in verses 13-18. The things which are (ha eisin). Plural 
verb (individualising the items) though 4a is neuter plural, 
certainly the messages to the seven churches (1:20 to 3:22) 
in relation to the world in general, possibly also partly 
epexegetic or explanatory of ha eides. The things which 
shall come to pass hereafter (ha mellei ginesthai meta tauta). ~ 
Present middle infinitive with me//ei, though both aorist and 
future are also used. Singular verb here (mellei) blending in 
a single view the future. In a rough outline this part begins 
in 4:1 and goes to end of chapter 22, though the future ap- 
pears also in chapters 2 and 3 and the present occurs in 
4 to 22 and the elements in the vision of Christ (1:13-18) 
reappear repeatedly. 

20. The mystery of the seven stars (to musterion ton hepta 
asteron). On the word mustérion see on Matt. 13:11; II 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 295 


Thess. 2:7; Col. 1:26. Here it means the inner meaning 
(the secret symbol) of a symbolic vision (Swete) as in 10:7; 
13:18; 17:7, 9 and Dan. 2:47. Probably the accusative ab- 
solute (Charles), “as for the mystery” (Robertson, Gram- 
mar, pp. 490, 1130), .as in Rom. 8:3. This item is picked 
out of the previous vision (1:16) as needing explanation at 
once and as affording a clue to what follows (2:1, 5). Which 
(hous). Masculine accusative retained without attraction 
to case of asteroén (genitive, hon). In my right hand (epi 
tés dexias mou). Or “‘upon,” but em /éi, etc., in verse 16. 
And the seven golden candlesticks (kai tas hepta luchnias tas 
chrusas). “‘The seven lampstands the golden,” identifying ~ 
the stars of verse 16 with the lampstands of verse 12. The 
accusative case here is even more peculiar than the accusa- 
tive absolute mustérion, since the genitive /uchnion after 
mustérion is what one would expect. Charles suggests that 
John did not revise his work. The angels of the seven 
churches (aggeloi ton hepta ekklesion). Anarthrous in the 
predicate (angels of, etc.). ‘“‘The seven churches” men- 
tioned in 1:4, 11. Various views of agge/os here exist. The 
simplest is the etymological meaning of the word as mes- 
senger from agge//d (Matt. 11:10) as messengers from the 
seven churches to Patmos or by John from Patmos to the 
churches (or both). Another view is that aggelos is the 
pastor of the church, the reading tén gunaika sou (thy wife) 
in 2:20 (if genuine) confirming this view. Some would even 
take it to be the bishop over the elders as episcopos in Igna- 
tius, but a separate agge/os in each church is against this 
idea. Some take it to be a symbol for the church itself or 
the spirit and genius of the church, though distinguished in 
this very verse from the churches themselves (the lamp- 
stands). Others take it to be the guardian angel of each 
church assuming angelic patrons to be taught in Matt. 
18:10; Acts 12:15. Each view is encompassed with diffi- 
culties, perhaps fewer belonging to the view that the “angel” 


296 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


is the pastor. Are seven churches (hepta ekklésiai eisin). 
These seven churches (1:4, 11) are themselves lampstands 
(1:12) reflecting the light of Christ to the world (Matt. 
5:14-16; John 8:12) in the midst of which Christ walks 
(i233), 


CHAPTER II 


1. In Ephesus (en Ephesoi). Near the sea on the river 
Cayster, the foremost city of Asia Minor, the temple-keeper 
of Artemis and her wonderful temple (Acts 19:35), the home 
of the magic arts (Ephesian letters, Acts 19:19) and of the 
mystery-cults, place of Paul’s three years’ stay (Acts I9:1— 
10; 20:17-38), where Aquila and Priscilla and Apollos la- 
boured (Acts 18:24-28), where Timothy wrought (I and II . 
Tim.), where the Apostle John preached in his old age. 
Surely it was a place of great privilege, of great preaching. 
It was about sixty miles from Patmos and the messenger 
would reach Ephesus first. It is a free city, a seat of pro- 
consular government (Acts 19:38), the end of the great road 
from the Euphrates. The port was a place of shifting sands, 
due to the silting up of the mouth of the Cayster. Ramsay 
(Letters to the Seven Churches, p. 210) calls it “the City of 
Change.” These things (tade). This demonstrative seven 
times here, once with the message to each church (2:1, 8, 
12, 18; 2:1, 7, 14), only once elsewhere in N.T. (Acts 21:11). 
He that holdeth (ho kraton). Present active articular parti- 
ciple of krated, a stronger word than echdn in 1:16, to which 
it refers. He that walketh (ho peripaton). Present active 
articular participle of peripated, an allusion to 1:13. These 
two epithets are drawn from the picture of Christ in 1:13-18, 
and appropriately to conditions in Ephesus describe Christ’s 
power over the churches as he moves among them. 

2. I know (oida). Rather than gindsko and so “‘empha- 
sizes better the absolute clearness of mental vision which 
photographs all the facts of life as they pass” (Swete). So 
also in 2:9, 13, 19; 3:1, 8, 15. For the distinction see John 
21:17, “where the universal knowledge passes into the field 

297 


298 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


of special observation.” Works (erga). The whole life and 
conduct as in John 6:29. And thy toil and patience (kai ton 
kopon kai ten hupomonén sou). “Both thy toil and patience,” 
in.explanation of erga, and see I Thess. 1:3, where all three 
words (ergon, kopos, hupomoné) occur together as here. See 
14:13 for sharp distinction between erga (activities) and 
kopot (toils, with weariness). Endurance (hupomoné) in 
hard toil (kopos). And that (kai hoti). Further explanation 
of kopos (hard toil). Not able (ou dunéi). This Koiné form 
for the Attic dunasai (second person singular indicative 
middle) occurs also in Mark 9:22; Luke 16:2. Bear (basta- 
sat). First aorist active infinitive of dastazd, for which verb 
see John 10:31; 12:6; Gal. 6:2. These evil men were indeed 
a heavy burden. And didst try (kai epeirasas). First aorist 
active indicative of peirazd, to test, a reference to a recent 
crisis when these Nicolaitans (verse 6) were condemned. 
The present tenses (dunéi, echeis) indicate the continuance 
of this attitude. Cf. I John 4:1. Which call themselves 
apostles (tous legontas heautous apostolous). Perhaps itin- 
erant missionaries of these Nicolaitans who posed as equal 
to or even superior to the original apostles, like the Judaizers 
so described by Paul (II Cor. 11:5, 13; 12:11). Paul had 
foretold such false teachers (Gnostics), grievous wolves, in 
Acts 20:29; in sheep’s clothing, Jesus had said (Matt. yeceys 
And they are not (kai ouk eisin). A parenthesis in Johannine 
style (John 2:9; 3:9; I John 3:1) for kai ouk ontas to corre. - 
spond to /egontas. And didst find (kai heures). Second 
aorist active indicative of heurisko. Dropping back to the 
regular structure parallel with epeirasas. False (pseudeis). 
Predicate accusative plural of pseudés, self-deceived deceiv- 
ers as in 21:8. 

3- Thou hast (echeis). Continued possession of patience. 
Didst bear (ebastasas). First aorist indicative of bastazo, re- 
peated reference to the crisis in verse 2. And hast not grown 
weary (kai ou kekopiakes). Perfect active indicative of 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 299 


kopiaé, old verb, to grow weary (Matt. 6:28), play on the 
word kopos, late form in -es, for the regular -as (/elukas). 
like aphékes (verse 4) and peptokes (verse 5). “Tired in 
loyalty, not of it. The Ephesian church can bear anything 
except the presence: of impostors in her membership” 
(Moffatt). 

4. This against thee, that (kata sou hoti). For the phrase 
“have against” see Matt. 5:23. The Aofi clause is the object 
of echd. Thou didst leave (aphekes). First aorist active 
(kappa aorist, but with -es instead of -as) of aphiemi, a defi- 
nite and sad departure. Thy first love (tén agapén sou ten 
proten). “Thy love the first.” This early love, proof of © 
the new life in Christ (I John 3:13f.), had cooled off in spite 
of their doctrinal purity. They had remained orthodox, 
but had become unloving partly because of the controversies 
with the Nicolaitans. 

5. Remember (mnémoneue). Present active imperative of 
mnemoneud, “continue mindful” (from mnémoin). Thou art 
fallen (peptokes). Perfect active indicative of pipta, state of 
completion. Down in the valley, look up to the cliff where 
pure love is and whence thou hast fallen down. And repent 
(kai metanoéson). First aorist active imperative of metanoed, 
urgent appeal for instant change of attitude and conduct 
before it is too late. And do (kai poiéson). First aorist 
active imperative of poied, “Do at once.” The first works 
(ta prota erga). Including the first love (Acts 19:20; 20:37; 
Eph. 1:3ff.) which has now grown cold (Matt. 24:12). Or 
else (ei de mé). Elliptical condition, the verb not expressed 
(metanoeis), a common idiom, seen again in verse 16, the 
condition expressed in full by ean mé in this verse and verse 
22. I come (erchomai). Futuristic present middle (John 
14:2f.). To thee (soi). Dative, as in 2:16 also. Will move 
(kinéso). Future active of kined. In Ignatius’ Epistle to 
Ephesus it appears that the church heeded this warning. 
Except thou repent (ean mé metanoésétis). Condition of third 


300 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


class with ean mé instead of ei mé above, with the first 
aorist active subjunctive of metanoeo. 

6. That thou hatest (hoti miseis). Accusative object clause 
in apposition with foufo (this). Trench tells of the words 
used in ancient Greek for hatred of evil (misoponéria) and 
misoponeéros (hater of evil), neither of which occurs in the 
N.T., but which accurately describe the angel of the church 
in Ephesus. Of the Nicolaitans (ton Nikolaiton). Mentioned 
again in verse 15 and really meant in verse 2. Irenzeus and 
Hippolytus take this sect to be followers of Nicolaus of 
Antioch, one of the seven deacons (Acts 6:5), a Jewish 
proselyte, who is said to have apostatized. There was such 
a sect in the second century (Tertullian), but whether de- 
scended from Nicolaus of Antioch is not certain, though 
possible (Lightfoot). It is even possible that the Balaamites 
of verse 14 were a variety of this same sect (verse 15). 
Which I also hate (ha kago miso). Christ himself hates the 
teachings and deeds of the Nicolaitans (Aa, not hous, deeds, 
not people), but the church in Pergamum tolerated them. 

7. He that hath an ear (ho echon ous). An individualizing 
note calling on each of the hearers (1:3) to listen (2:7, 11, 
17, 28; 3:3, 6, 13, 22) and a reminiscence of the words of 
Jesus in the Synoptics (Matt. 11:15; 13:9, 43; Mark 4:9, 
23; Luke 8:8; 14:35), but not in John’s Gospel. The spirit 
(to pneuma). The Holy Spirit as in 14:13; 22:17. Both 
Christ and the Holy Spirit deliver this message. ‘The’ 
Spirit of Christ in the prophet is the interpreter of Christ’s 
voice” (Swete). To him that overcometh (toi nikonti). Da- 
tive of the present (continuous victory) active articular par- 
ticiple of nikad, a common Johannine verb (John 16:33; 
I John 2:13f.; 4:4; §:4f.; Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21; 
$353 12:11; 15:2; 17:14; 21:7). Faith is dominant in Paul, 
victory in John, faith is victory (I John 5:4). So in each 
promise to these churches. J will give (dosd). Future ac- 
tive of diddmi as in 2:10, 17, 23, 26, 28; 3:8, 21; 6:4; DPEZs 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 301 


21:6. To eat (phagein). Second aorist active infinitive of 
esthio. Of the tree of life (ek tou xulou tés 2dés). Note ek 
with the ablative with phagein, like our “eat of” (from or 
part of). From Gen. 2:9; 3:22. Again in Rev. 22:2, 14 as 
here for immortality. . This tree is now in the Garden of 
God. For the water of life see 21:6; 22:17 (Cf. John 4:10, 
13f.). Which (ho). The xulon (tree). In the Paradise of 
God (en toi paradeisoi tou theou). Persian word, for which 
see Luke 23:43; II Cor. 12:4. The abode of God and the 
home of the redeemed with Christ, not a mere intermediate 
state. It was originally a garden of delight and finally 
heaven itself (Trench), as here. 

8. In Smyrna (en Smurnéi). North of Ephesus, on a gulf 
of the Agean, one of the great cities of Asia (province), a 
seat of emperor-worship with temple to Tiberius, with many 
Jews hostile to Christianity who later join in the martyrdom 
of Polycarp, poor church (rich in grace) which receives only 
praise from Christ, scene of the recent massacre of Greeks 
by the Turks. Ramsay (op. cit., p. 251) terms Smyrna “‘the 
City of Life.” Christianity has held on here better than 
in any city of Asia. The first and the last (ho protos kai ho 
eschatos). Repeating the language of 1:17. Which was dead 
(hos egeneto nekros). Rather, “who became dead” (second 
aorist middle indicative of ginomai) as in 1:18. And lived 
again (kai ezesen). First aorist (ingressive, came to life) 
active of 2a6 (ho zon in 1:18). Emphasis on the resurrection 
of Christ. 

9. Thy tribulation and thy poverty (sou tén thlipsin kai 
ptocheian). Separate articles of same gender, emphasizing 
eachitem. The tribulation was probably persecution, which 
helped to intensify the poverty of the Christians (James 
2:5; I Cor. 1:26; II Cor. 6:10; 8:2). In contrast with the 
wealthy church in Laodicea (3:17). But thou art rich (alla 
plousios ei). Parenthesis to show the spiritual riches of 
this church in contrast with the spiritual poverty in Lao- 


302 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


dicea (3:17), this a rich poor church, that a poor rich church. 
Rich in grace toward God (Luke 12:21) and in good deeds 
(I Tim. 6:18). Perhaps Jews and pagans had pillaged their 
property (Heb. 10:34), poor as they already were. Blas- 
phemy (blasphémian). Reviling believers in Christ. See 
Mark 7:22. The precise charge by these Jews is not in- 
dicated, but see Acts 13:45. Of them which say (ek ton 
legonton). “From those saying” (ek with the ablative plural 
of the present active articular participle of /ego). They are 
Fews (Ioudaious einai heautous). ‘This is the accusative of 
general reference and the infinitive in indirect discourse after 
lego (Acts 5:36; 8:9) even though /egonton is here ablative 
(cf. 3:9), common idiom. These are actual Jews and only 
Jews, not Christians. dud they are not (kai ouk etsin). 
Another parenthesis like that in 2:2. These are Jews in 
name only, not spiritual Jews (Gal. 6:15f., Rom. 2:28). 4 
synagogue of Satan (sunagogé tou Satana). In 3:9 again and 
note 2:13, 24, serving the devil (John 8:44) instead of the 
Lord (Numb. 16:3; 20:4). 

10. Fear not (mé phobou). Asin 1:17. Worse things are 
about to come than poverty and blasphemy, perhaps prison 
and death, for the devil “is about to cast” (mellei ballein), 
“is going to cast.”’ Some of you (ex humon). Without tinas 
(some) before ex humon, a common idiom as in 3:9; 11:19; 
Luke 11:49. That ye may be tried (hina peirasthéte). Pur- 
pose clause with hina and the first aorist passive subjunctive : 
of peirazd. John himself is in exile. Peter and John had 
often been in prison together. James the brother of John, 
Paul, and Peter had all suffered martyrdom. In 3:10 a 
general persecution is outlined by peirasmos.. Ye shall have 
(hexete). Future active, but some MSS. read echéte (present 
active subjunctive with Aina, “that ye may have”). Tribu- 
lation ten days (thlipsin hémeron deka). ‘Tribulation of ten 
days” (or “within ten days’’). It is unwise to seek a literal 
meaning for ten days. Even ten days of suffering might 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 303 


seem an eternity while they lasted. Be thou faithful (ginou 
pistos). “Keep on becoming faithful” (present middle im- 
perative of ginomai), “keep on proving faithful unto death” 
(Heb. 12:4) as the martyrs have done (Jesus most of all). 
The crown of life (ton stephanon tes zxoés). See this very 
image in James 1:12, a familiar metaphor in the games at 
Smyrna and elsewhere in which the prize was a garland. 
See also 3:11. The crown consists in life (2:7). See Paul’s 
use of stephanos in I Cor. 9:25; II Tim. 4:8. 

11. Shall not be hurt (ou mé adikéthéi). Strong double 
negative with first aorist passive subjunctive of adiked, old 
verb, to act unjustly (from adikos), here to do harm or wrong ~ 
to one, old usage as in 6:6; 7:2f.; 9:4, 10; 11:5. Of the second 
death (ek tou thanatou tou deuterou). Ek here used for the 
agent or instrument as often (3:18; 9:2; 18:1). See 20:6, 14; 
21:8 where “the second death” is explained as “the lake of 
fire.” The idea is present in Dan. 12:3 and John 5:29 and is 
current in Jewish circles as in the Jerusalem Targum on 
Deut. 33:6 and in Philo. Itis not annihilation. The Chris. 
tians put to death in the persecution will at least escape this 
second death (eternal punishment). 

12. In Pergamum (en Pergamdi). Ina north-easterly di- 
rection from Smyrna in the Caicus Valley, some fifty-five 
miles away, in Mysia, on a lofty hill, a great political and 
religious centre. Ramsay (op. cit., p. 281) calls it “the royal 
city, the city of authority.” Eumenes II (8.c. 197-159) 
extended it and embellished it with many great buildings, 
including a library with 200,000 volumes, second only to 
Alexandria. The Kingdom of Pergamum became a Roman 
province B.c. 130. Pliny termed it the most illustrious city 
of Asia. Parchment (charta Pergamena) derived its name 
from Pergamum. It was a rival of Ephesus in the temples 
to Zeus, Athena, Dionysos, in the great grove Nicephorium 
(the glory of the city). Next to this was the grove and 
temple of Asklepios, the god of healing, called the god of 


304 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Pergamum, with a university for medical study. Pergamum 
was the first city in Asia (A.D. 29) with a temple for the 
worship of Augustus (Octavius Cesar). Hence in the 
Apocalypse Pergamum is a very centre of emperor-worship 
“where Satan dwells” (2:13). Here also the Nicolaitans 
flourished (2:15) as in Ephesus (2:6) and in Thyatira (2:20f.). 
Like Ephesus this city is called temple-sweeper (medkoros) for 
the gods. The sharp two-edged sword (ten romphaian tén 
distomon tén oxeian). This item repeated from 1:16 in the 
same order of words with the article three times (the sword 
the two-mouthed the sharp) singling out each point. 

13. Where (pou—hopou). Pou is interrogative adverb 
used here in an indirect question as in John 1:39. Hopou is 
relative adverb referring to pou. Satan’s throne (ho thronos 
tou Satana). Satan not simply resided in Pergamum, but his 
“throne” or seat of power of king or judge (Matt. 19:28; 
Luke 1:32, 52). The symbol of Asklepios was the serpent 
as it is of Satan (12:9; 20:2). There was, besides, a great 
throne altar to Zeus cut on the Acropolis rock, symbol of 
“rampant paganism” (Swete) and the new Czsar-worship 
with the recent martyrdom of Antipas made Pergamum 
indeed a very throne of Satan. Holdest fast my name 
(krateis to onoma sou). Present active indicative of krated, 
“dost keep on holding,” as in 2:25, 3:11. This church re- 
fused to say Kurios Kaisar (Martyrd. Polyc. 8f.) and con- 
tinued to say Kurios Iésous (I Cor. 12:3). They stood true - 
against the emperor-worship. Didst not deny (ouk érnéso). 
First aorist middle second person singular of arneomai. 
Reference to a specific incident not known to us. My faith 
(tén pistin mou). Objective genitive, “thy faith in me.” 
Of Antipas (Antipas). Indeclinable in this form. It is pos- 
sible that Antipa (genitive) was really written, though unim- 
portant as the nominative follows in apposition. Nothing is 
really known of this early martyr in Pergamum before the 
writing of the Apocalypse. One legend is that he was burnt 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 305 


to death in a brazen bull. Other martyrs followed him at 
Pergamum (Agathonice, Attalus, Carpus, Polybus). My 
witness (ho martus mou). Nominative in apposition with a 
genitive as in 1:5 (with ablative), common solecism in the 
Apocalypse. “Witness” as Jesus had said they should be 
(Acts 1:8) and Stephen was (Acts 22:20) and others were 
(Rev. 17:6). The word later (by third century) took on the 
modern meaning of martyr. My faithful one (ho pistos mou). 
Nominative also, with mou also. Jesus gives Antipas his 
own title (Swete) asin 1:5;3:14. Faithfuluntodeath. Was 
killed (apektanthe). First aorist passive indicative of apok- 
teind, this passive form common in the Apocalypse (2:13; 
6:11; 5:9, 13; 13:10, 15; 18, 20; 19:21). Among you (par’ 
humin). By your side. Proof of the throne of Satan, 
“where Satan dwells” (hopou ho Satandas katoikei), repeated 
for emphasis. 

14. There (ekei). That is par’ humin (among you). A 
party in the church that resisted emperor-worship, to the 
death in the case of Antipas, yet were caught in the insidious 
wiles of the Nicolaitans which the church in Ephesus with- 
stood. Some that hold (kratountas). ‘‘Men holding” (pres- 
ent active participle of krated). The teaching of Balaam (ten 
didachén Balaam). Indeclinable substantive Balaam (Numb. 
25:1-g; 31:15f.). The point of likeness of these heretics 
with Balaam is here explained. Taught Balak (edidasken 
toi Balak). Imperfect indicative of didask6é, Balaam’s habit, 
“as the prototype of all corrupt teachers” (Charles). These 
early Gnostics practised licentiousness as a principle since 
they were not under law, but under grace (Rom. 6:15). The 
use of the dative with didasko is a colloquialism rather than 
a Hebraism. Two accusatives often occur with didaské. 
To cast a stumbling-block (balein skandalon). Second aorist 
active infinitive (accusative case after edidasken) of ballé, 
regular use with skandalon (trap) like tithémi skandalon in 
Rom. 14:13. Balaam, as Josephus and Philo also say, 


306 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


showed Balak how to set a trap for the Israelites by beguiling 
them into the double sin of idolatry and fornication, which 
often went together (and do so still). To eat things sacrificed 
to idols (phagein eidolothuta). Second aorist active infinitive 
of esthid and the verbal adjective (from eidélon and thud), 
quoted here from Numb. 25:1f., but in inverse order, re- 
peated in other order in verse 20. See Acts 15:29; 21:25; 
I Cor. 8:1ff. for the controversy over the temptation to 
Gentile Christians to do what in itself was harmless, but 
which led to evil if it led to participation in the pagan feasts. 
Perhaps both ideas are involved here. Balaam taught 
Balak how to lead the Israelites into sin in both ways. 

15. So thou also (houtos kai su). Thou and the church at 
Pergamum as Israel had the wiles of Balaam. The teaching 
of the Nicolaitans likewise (tén didachén ton WNikolaiton 
homoids). See on 1:6 for the Nicolaitans. The use of 
homoids (likewise) here shows that they followed Balaam in 
not obeying the decision of the Conference at Jerusalem 
(Acts 15:20, 29) about idolatry and fornication, with the 
result that they encouraged a return to pagan laxity of 
morals (Swete). Some wrongly hold that these Nicolaitans 
were Pauline Christians in the face of Col. 3:5-8; Eph. 5:3-6. 

16. Repent therefore (metanoéson oun). First aorist (tense 
of urgency) active imperative of metanoed with the inferential 
particle oun (as a result of their sin). J come (erchomai). 
Futuristic present middle indicative, “I am coming” (immi- 
nent), as in 2:5 with tachu as in 3:11; 11:14; 22:7,12,20. As 
with en tachei (1:1), we do not know how soon “quickly”’ is 
meant to be understood. But it is a real threat. Against 
them (met? auton). This proposition with polemed rather 
than kata (against) is common in the LXX, but in the N.T. 
only in Rev. 2:16; 12:7; 13:4; 17:14 and the verb itself 
nowhere else in N.T. except James 4:2. ‘“‘An eternal roll of 
thunder from the throne” (Renan). “The glorified Christ 
is in this book a Warrior, who fights with the sharp sword of 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 307 


the word” (Swete). With (en). Instrumental use of en. 
For the language see 1:16; 2:12; 19:15. 

17. Of the hidden manna (tou manna tou kekrummenou). 
“Of the manna the hidden” (perfect passive articular par- 
ticiple of krupto). The partitive genitive, the only N.T. 
example with diddmi, though Q reads fo (accusative) here. 
For examples of the ablative with apo and ek see Robertson, 
Grammar, p. 519. See John 6:31, 49 for the indeclinable 
word manna. ‘The golden pot of manna was “laid up before 
God in the ark” (Ex. 16:23). It was believed that Jeremiah 
hid the ark, before the destruction of Jerusalem, where it 
would not be discovered till Israel was restored (II Macc. 
2:5ff.). Christ is the true bread from heaven (John 6:31-33, 
48-51) and that may be the idea here. Those faithful to 
Christ will have transcendent fellowship with him. Swete 
takes it to be “the life-sustaining power of the Sacred 
Humanity now hid with Christ in God.” 4 white stone 
(pséphon leuken). This old word for pebble (from psad, to 
rub) was used in courts of justice, black pebbles for con- 
demning, white pebbles for acquitting. The only other use 
of the word in the N.T. is in Acts 26:10, where Paul speaks 
of “depositing his pebble” (katénegka pséphon) or casting his 
vote. The white stone with one’s name on it was used to 
admit one to entertainments and also as an amulet or charm. 
A new name written (onoma kainon gegrammenon). Perfect 
passive predicate participle of graphd. Not the man’s own 
name, but that of Christ (Heitmiller, Im Namen Feésu, 
p- 128-265). See 3:12 for the name of God so written on 
one. The man himself may be the pséphos on which 
the new name is written. “The true Christian has a 
charmed life” (Moffatt). But he that receiveth it (ei mé ho 
lambanon). “‘Except the one receiving it.” See Matt. 
11:27 for like intimate and secret knowledge between the 
Father and the Son and the one to whom the Son wills to 
reveal the Father. See also Rev. 19:12. 


308 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


18. In Thyatira (en Thuateirois). Some forty miles south- 
east of Pergamum, a Lydian city on the edge of Mysia, under 
Rome since B.c. 190, a centre of trade, especially for the royal 
purple, home of Lydia of Philippi (Acts 16:14f.), shown by 
inscriptions to be full of trade guilds, Apollo the chief deity 
with no emperor-worship, centre of activity by the Nico- 
laitans with their idolatry and licentiousness under a 
‘“prophetess” who defied the church there. Ramsay calls 
it ““Weakness Made Strong” (op. cit., p. 316). The Son of 
God (ho huios tou theou). Here Jesus is represented as calling 
himself by this title as in John 11:4 and as he affirms on 
path in Matt. 26:63f. ‘The Word of God” occurs in 19:13. 
His eyes like a flame of fire (tous ophthalmous autou hos 
phloga puros). Asin 1:14. His feet like burnished brass (hoi 
podes autou homoioi chalkolibandi). As in 1:15. 

19. Thy works (sou ta erga). As in 2:2 and explained 
(explanatory use of kai=namely) by what follows. Four 
items are given, with separate feminine article for each (téz 
agapen, tén pistin, tén diakonian, ten hupomonen), a longer list 
of graces than in 2:2 for Ephesus. More praise is given in 
the case of Ephesus and Thyatira when blame follows than 
in the case of Smyrna and Philadelphia when no fault is 
found. Love comes first in this list in true Johannine 
fashion. Faith (pistin) here may be “faithfulness,” and 
ministry (diakonian) is ministration to needs of others (Acts 
11:29; 1 Cor. 16:15). And that (kai). Only kai (and) in the - 
Greek, but doubtless oti (that) is understood. Than the 
first (ton proton). Ablative after the comparative pleiona 
(more). 

20. Thou sufferest (apheis). Late vernacular present active 
indicative second person singular as if from a form aphed 
instead of the usual aphiémi forms. The woman Fezebel 
(ten gunaika Iezabel). Symbolical name for some prominent 
woman in the church in Thyatira, like the infamous wife of 
Ahab who was guilty of whoredom and witchcraft (I Kings 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 309 


16:31; II Kings 9:22) and who sought to drive out the 
worship of God from Israel. Some MSS. here (A Q 40 min.s) 
have sou (thy wife, thy woman Ramsay makes it), but surely 
Aleph C P rightly reject sow. Otherwise she is the pastor’s 
wife! Which calleth. herself a prophetess (hé legousa heautén 
prophétin). Nominative articular participle of /egd in appo- 
sition with the accusative gunaika like ho martus in apposition 
with Antipas in 2:13. Prophétis is an old word, feminine 
form for prophétés, in N.T. only here and Luke 2:36 (Anna), 
two extremes surely. See Acts 21:9 for the daughters of 
Philip who prophesied. And she teacheth and seduceth (kai 
didaskei kai planai). A resolution of the participles (didas- 
kousa kai plandsa) into finite verbs (present active indica- 
tives) asin 1:5f. This woman was not a real prophetess, but 
a false one with loud claims and loose living. One is puzzled 
to know how such a woman had so much shrewdness and 
sex-appeal as to lead astray the servants of God in that 
church. The church tolerated the Nicolaitans and this 
leader whose primary object was sexual immorality (Charles) 
and became too much involved with her to handle the heresy. 

21. I gave her time (edoka autéi chronon). First aorist 
active indicative of diddmi, allusion to a definite visit or 
message of warning to this woman. That she should repent 
(hina metanoéséi). Sub-final use of hina with first aorist 
active subjunctive of metanoed. And she willeth not (kai ou 
thelei). “And she is not willing.” Blunt and final like Matt. 
23:37. To repent of (metanoésai ek). First aorist (ingressive) 
active infinitive with ek, “to make a change out of,” the 
usual construction with metanoed in this book (2:22; 9:20ff.; 
16:11), with apo in Acts 8:22. Porneia (fornication) here, 
but moicheud (to commit adultery) in verse 22. 

22. I do cast (ballo). Futuristic present active indicative 
rather than the future Ja/d, since judgment is imminent. 
Into a bed (eis klinén). “A bed of sickness in contrast with 
the bed of adultery” (Beckwith). Them that commit adultery 


310 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


with her (tous moicheuontas met autés). Present active ar- 
ticular participle accusative plural of moicheud. The actual 
paramours of the woman Jezebel, guilty of both porneia 
(fornication, verse 21) and moicheia (adultery), works of 
Jezebel of old and of this Jezebel. There may be also an 
allusion to the spiritual adultery (II Cor. 11:2) towards God 
and Christ as of old (Jer. 3:8; 5:7; Ezek. 16:22). Except they 
repent (ean mé metanoésousin). Condition of first class with 
ean mé and the future active indicative of metanoed, put in 
this vivid form rather than the aorist subjunctive (-dsin) 
third-class condition. Of her works (ek ton ergin autés). 
Autes (her) correct rather than autén (their). Jezebel was 
chiefly responsible. 

23. I will kill with death (apokteno en thanatoi). Future 
(volitive) active of apokteind with the tautological (cognate) 
en thanatoi (in the sense of pestilence) as in Ezek. 33:27. 
Her children (ta tekna autés). Either her actual children, 
like the fate of Ahab’s sons (II Kings 10:7) or “‘her spiritual 
progeny’’ (Swete) who have completely accepted her Nico- 
laitan practices. Shall know (gndsontai). Future (ingressive 
punctiliar) middle of gindskd, “shall come to know.” “The 
doom of the offenders was to be known as widely as the 
scandal had been” (Charles). Searcheth (eraundn). Present 
active articular participle of eraunad, to follow up, to track 
out, late form for eréunad, from Jer. 17:10. Reins (nephrous). 
Old word for kidneys, here only in N.T., quoted also with — 
kardias from Jer. 17:10. ‘See 22:17 for the reward of pun- 
ishment. 

24. To you the rest (humin tois loipois). Dative case. 
Those who hold out against Jezebel, not necessarily a minor- 
ity (9:20; 19:21; I Thess. 4:13). 4s many as (hosoi). In- 
clusive of all “the rest.” This teaching (tén didachén tauten). 
That of Jezebel. Which (hoitines). “Which very ones,” 
generic of the class, explanatory definition as in 1:7. Know 
not (ouk egnosan). Second aorist (ingressive) active of 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 311 


ginosko, “did not come to know by experience.” The deep 
things of Satan (ta bathea tou Satana). The Ophites. (wor- 
shippers of the serpent) and-other later Gnostics (Cainites, 
Carpocratians, Naassenes) boasted of their knowledge of 
“the deep things,” some claiming this very language about 
Satan (the serpent) as Paul did of God (I Cor. 2:10). It is 
not clear whether the words here quoted are a boast of the 
Nicolaitans or a reproach on the other Christians for not 
knowing the depths of sin. Some even claimed that they 
could indulge in immorality without sinning (I John 1:10; 
3:10). Perhaps both ideas are involved. As they say (his 
legousin). Probably referring to the heretics who ridicule - 
the piety of the other Christians. None other burden (ou— 
allo baros). Baros refers to weight (Matt. 20:12), phortion, 
from pherd, to bear, refers to load (Gal. 6:5), ogkos to bulk 
(Heb. 12:1). Apparently a reference to the decision of the 
Jerusalem Conference (Acts 15:28) where the very word 
baros is used and mention is made about the two items in 
verse 20 (fornication and idolatry) without mentioning the 
others about things strangled, etc. See the Pharisaic narrow- 
ness in Matt. 23:4. 

25. Howbeit (plen). Common after ouk allo as a preposi- 
tion with the ablative (Mark 12:32), but here a conjunction 
as in Phil. 1:18. Hold fast (kratésate). First aorist active 
imperative of krated, either ingressive (get a grip on) or con- 
stative (hold on as a single decisive effort). See present 
imperative kratei in 3:11 (keep on holding). Til] I come 
(achri hou an héxd). Indefinite temporal clause with achri 
hou (until which time) with modal av and either the future 
active indicative or the first aorist active subjunctive of héké 
(usual idiom with achri in Revelation as in 7:3; 15:8; 20:3, 5). 

26. He that overcometh and he that keepeth (ho nikon kai ho 
téron). Present active articular participles of nikaé and ¢éred 
in the nominative absolute (xominativus pendens) as in 3:12, 
21, resumed by the dative autoi (to him), as in verses 7, 17. 


312 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Unto the end (achri telous). That is, achri hou an héxo above. 
Authority over the nations (exousian epi ton ethnon). From 
Ps. 2:8f. The followers of the Messiah will share in his 
victory over his enemies (1:6; 12:5; 19:15). 

27. He shall rule (poimanei). Future active of poimaind, 
to shepherd (from poimén, shepherd), also from Ps. 2:8f. 
See again Rev. 7:17; 12:5; 19:15. With a rod of iron (en 
rabdoi siderai). Continuing the quotation. Instrumental 
use of en. Rabdos (feminine) is the royal sceptre and indi- 
cates rigorous rule. The vessels of the potter (ta skeué ta 
keramika). Old adjective, belonging to a potter (kerameus, 
keramos), here only in N.T. Are broken to shivers (suntri- 
betai). Present passive indicative of suntribé, old verb, to 
rub together, to break in pieces (Mark 14:3). 

28. 4s I also have received (hos kago eilépha). Perfect ac- 
tive indicative of /amband. Christ still possesses the power 
from the Father (Acts 2:33; Ps. 2:7). The morning star 
(ton astera ton proinon). “The star the morning one.” In 
22:16 Christ is the bright morning star. The victor will 
nave Christ himself. 


CHAPTERVWIILI 


1. In Sardis (en Sardesin). Some thirty miles south-east 
of Thyatira, old capital of Lydia, wealthy and the home of 
Croesus, conquered by Cyrus and then by Alexander the 
Great, in B.c. 214 by Antiochus the Great, at the crossing 
of Roman roads, in a plain watered by the river Pactolus, 
according to Pliny the place where the dyeing of wool was 
discovered, seat of the licentious worship of Cybele and the- 
ruins of the temple still there, called by Ramsay (op. cit., 
P- 354) “the city of Death,” city of softness and luxury, 
of apathy and immorality, “a contrast of past splendour 
and present unresting decline” (Charles). Along with Lao- 
dicea it was blamed most of all the seven churches. That 
hath the seven Spirits of God (ho echin ta hepta pneumata tou 
theou). For which picture of the Holy Spirit see 1:4. And 
the seven stars (kai tous hepta asteras). As in 1:16, 20. 4 
name that thou livest (onoma hoti zéis). A name in contrast 
with reality. The oti clause in apposition with onoma. 
And thou art dead (kai nekros ei). “The paradox of death 
under the name of life’ (Swete). Not complete (a nucleus 
of life) death (verse 2), but rapidly dying. See the picture 
in James 2:17; II Cor. 6:9; II Tim. 3:5. 

2. Be thou watchful (ginou grégoron). Periphrastic im- 
perative with present middle of ginomai (keep on becoming) 
and present active participle of grégored (late present from 
perfect egrégora and that from egeird, as in Matt. 24:42) 
and see 16:15 for grégored also. He does not say “‘Arise 
from the dead” (Eph. 5:14), for there are vestiges of life. 
Those still alive are addressed through the angel of the 
church. Stablish the things that remain (sterison ta loipa). 
First aorist active imperative of stérizd, to make stable. 

313 


314 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Those not actually dead, but in grave peril. See a like 
command to Titus in Crete (1:5). Every new pastor faces 
such a problem. Which were ready to die (ha emellon apoth- 
anein). Imperfect active plural because the individuals, 
though neuter plural, are regarded as living realities. The 
imperfect looking on the situation “with a delicate opti- 
mism” (Swete) as having passed the crisis, a sort of epistolary 
imperfect. For I have found no works of thine (ou gar heureka 
sou erga). “‘For I have not found any works of thine.” 
Perfect active indicative of heuriskd. The church as a whole 
represented by sou (thy). Fulfilled (pepléromena). Perfect 
passive predicate participle of pl/érod. Their works have not 
measured up to God’s standard (endpion tou theou mou). 

3- Remember (mnémoneue). ‘‘Keep in mind,” as in 2:5. 
Therefore (oun). Resumptive and coérdinating as in 1:19; 
2:5. Thou hast received (eiléphas). Perfect active indicative 
of lamband, “as a permanent deposit” (Vincent). Didst 
hear (ékousas). First aorist active indicative, the act of 
hearing at the time. And keep it (kai térei). Present active 
imperative of téred, “hold on to what thou hast.” And re- 
pent (kai metanoéson). First aorist active imperative of 
metanoed, “Turn at once.” If therefore thou shalt not watch 
(can oun mé grégoréséis). Condition of third class with ean 
mé and the first aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive of 
grégored, ‘“if then thou do not wake up.” J will come (héxd). 
Certainly future active here, though probably aorist sub- - 
junctive in 2:25. 4s a thief (hos kleptes). As Jesus had 
already said (Matt. 24:43; Luke 12:39), as Paul had said 
(I Thess. 5:2), as Peter had said (II Pet. 3:10), as Jesus 
will say again (Rev. 16:15). Thou shalt not know (ou mé 
gndis). Strong double negative ow mé with second aorist 
active subjunctive of gindskd, though some MSS. have the 
future middle indicative gndséi. What hour (poian horan). 
A rare classical idiom (accusative) surviving in the Koiné 
rather than the genitive of time, somewhat like John 4:52; 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 315 


Acts 20:16 (Robertson, Grammar, p. 470f.). Indirect ques- 
tion with poian. 

4. 4 few names (oliga onomata). This use of onoma for 
persons is seen in the Koiné (Deissmann, Bidle Studies, p. 
196f.) as in Acts 1:15; Rev. 11:13. Did not defile (ouk 
emolunan). First aorist active indicative of moluno (I Cor. 
8:7; I Pet. 1:4), pollution. They shall walk (peripatésousin). 
Future active of peripated, promise of fellowship with Christ 
(met emou, with me) “in white” (en Jeukois), as symbols of 
purity (7:9, 13) like the angel (Matt. 28:3), with possibly 
a reference to Enoch (Gen. 5:22). For they are worthy (hoti 
axioi eisin). ‘To walk with Christ, not worthy in the same 
sense as God and Christ (4:11; 5:9), but in a relative sense. 
See Rev. 16:6 for bad sense of axios. 

§. Shall be arrayed (peribaleitai). Future middle indica- 
tive of periballo, to fling around one, here and in 4:4 with 
en and the locative, but usually in this book with the ac- 
cusative of the thing, retained in the passive or with the 
rete leh opens rer pas Hest Fh 724 08167) 193873)? 
In white garments (en himatiois leukois). Apparently the 
spiritual bodies in the risen life as in II Cor. §:1, 4 and often 
in Revelation (3:4, 5; 6:11; 7:9, 13f.; 19:8). J will in no 
wise blot out (ou mé exaleipso). Strong double negative ou 
mé and the first aorist active (or future) of exaleipho, old 
word, to wipe out (Acts 3:19). Of the book of life (ek tés 
biblou tés zoés). Ablative case with ek. This divine register 
first occurs in Ex. 32:32f. and often in the O.T. See Luke 
10:20; Phil. 4:3; Rev. 13:8; 20:15; 21:27. The book is in 
Christ’s hands (13:8; 21:27). His name (to onoma autou). 
The name of the one who overcomes (fo nikon). Clear 
reminiscence of the words of Christ about confessing to the 
Father those who confess him here (Matt. 10:32; Mark 
$:38; Luke 9:26; 12:8). Whether John knew the Synoptic 
Gospels (and why not?) he certainly knew such sayings of 
Tesus.

7. In Philadelphia (en Philadelphiai). Some twenty-eight 
miles south-east of Sardis, in Lydia, subject to earthquakes, 
rebuilt by Tiberius after the great earthquake of a.D. 17, 
for a time called in coins Neo-Cesarea, in wine-growing 
district with Bacchus (Dionysos) as the chief deity, on fine 
Roman roads and of commercial importance, though not a 
large city, called by Ramsay (op. cit., p. 392) ‘“‘the Mission- 
ary City” to promote the spread of the Graeco-Roman 
civilization and then of Christianity, later offering stubborn 
resistance to the Turks (1379-90 a.D.) and now called Ala- 
Sheher (reddish city, Charles, from the red hills behind it). 
The chief opposition to the faithful little church is from the 
Jews (cf. Rom. 9-11). There are some 1,000 Christians 
there today. The holy, he that is true (ho hagios, ho alethinos). 
Separate articles (four in all) for each item in this descrip- 
tion. ‘“‘The holy, the genuine.’’ Asyndeton in the Greek. 
Latin Vulgate, Sanctus et Verus. Ho hagios is ascribed to 
God in 4:8; 6:10 (both hagios and aléthinos as here), but 
to Christ in Mark 1:24; Luke 4:34; John 6:69; Acts 4:27, 
30; I John 2:20, a recognized title of the Messiah as the 
consecrated one set apart. Swete notes that aléthinos is 
verus as distinguished from verax (aléthés). So it is applied 
to God in 6:10 and to Christ in 3:14; 19:11 as in John 1:9; 
6:32; 15:1. He that hath the key of David (ho echon tén klein 
Daueid). This epithet comes from Is. 22:22, where Eliakim 
as the chief steward of the royal household holds the keys 
of power. Christ as the Messiah (Rev. 5:5; 22:16) has ex- 
clusive power in heaven, on earth, and in Hades (Matt. 
16:19; 28:18; Rom. 14:9; Phil. 2:9f.; Rev. 1:18). Christ 
has power to admit and exclude of his own will (Matt. 
25:10f.; Eph. 1:22; Rev. 3:21; 19:11-16; 20:4; 22:16). And 
none shall shut (kai oudeis kleisei). Charles calls the struc- 
ture Hebrew (future active indicative of kleid), and not 
Greek because it does not correspond to the present artic- 
ular participle just before ho anoigdn (the one opening), but 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 317 


it occurs often in this book as in the very next clause, “and 
none openeth” (kai oudeis anoigei) over against kleidn 
(present active participle, opening) though here some MSS. 
read kieiei (present active indicative, open). 

8. I have set (dedoka). Perfect active indicative of didomi, 
“TI have given” (a gift of Christ, this open door). See Luke 
12:51 for a like use of diddmi. A door .opened (thuran 
Enedigmenén). Perfect (triple reduplication) passive pred- 
icate participle of anoigé (verse 7) accusative feminine singu- 
lar. The metaphor of the open door was a common one 
(John 10:7-9; Acts 14:27; I Cor. 16:9; II Cor. 2:12; Col. 
4:3; Rev. 3:20; 4:1). Probably it means here a good oppor. 
tunity for missionary effort in spite of the Jewish hostility. 
Which (hén—autén). Pleonastic vernacular and Hebrew 
repetition of the personal pronoun au/én (it) after the rela- 
tive hén (which). Direct reference to the statement in verse 
7. That (hoti). This conjunction resumes the construction 
of oida sou ta erga (1 know thy works) after the parenthesis 
(tdou—autén, Behold—shut). 4 little power (mikran duna, 
min). Probably “little power,” little influence or weight 
in Philadelphia, the members probably from the lower classes 
(I Cor. 1:26f.). And didst keep (kai etérésas). “And yet 
(adversative use of kai) didst keep” (first aorist active in- 
dicative of téred) my word in some crisis of trial. See John 
17:6 for the phrase “‘keeping the word.” Didst not deny 
(ouk érnésé). First aorist middle indicative second person 
singular of arneomai. ‘The issue was probably forced by 
the Jews (cf. 2:9), but they stood true. 

g. I give (dido). Late omega form for didémi, but the 
-mi form in 17:13 (didoasin). These Jewish converts are a 
gift from Christ. For this use of diddmi see Acts 2:27; 
10:40; 14:3. There is ellipse of sivas before ek as in 2:10 
(ex humon) and see 2:9 for ‘‘the synagogue of Satan.” Of 
them which say (ton legonton). Ablative plural in apposition 
with sunagogés. On the construction of heautous Ioudaious 


318 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


einai see on 2:9 (Loudaious einai heautous, the order of 
words being immaterial). But do lie (alla pseudontai). Pres- 
ent middle indicative of pseudomai, explanatory positive, 
addition here to kai ouk eisin of 2:9, in contrast also with 
ho aléthinos of verse 7 and in Johannine style (John 8:44; 
I John 1:10; 2:4). J will make them (poiéso autous). Future 
active indicative of poied, resuming the prophecy after the 
parenthesis (tén—pseudontai, which say—but do lie). To 
come and worship (hina hexousin kai proskunésousin). “That 
they come and worship” (final clause, like facio ut in Latin, 
with hina and the future active of hé@kd and proskuned). 
The language is based on Is. 45:14; 60:14. The Jews ex- 
pected homage (not worship in the strict sense) from the 
Gentiles, but it will come to the Christians at last (I Cor. 
14:24). Later Ignatius (Philad. 6) warns this church against 
Judaizing Christians, perhaps one result of an influx of Jews. 
And to know (kai gnésin). Continuation of the purpose 
clause with Aina, but with the second aorist active subjunc- 
tive rather than the less usual future indicative. See both 
constructions also with Aina in 22:14. Probably a reminis- 
cence of Is. 43:4 in egd égapésa se (I loved thee), first aorist 
active indicative. 

10. Patience (hupomenés). “Endurance” as in 13:10; 
14:12 as also in II Thess. 3:5. Thou didst keep (etérésas)—I 
also will keep (kago teréso). Aorist active indicative and 
future active corresponding to each other. For a like play " 
on the tenses of this verb by Christ see John 17:6 (tetérékan), 
II (¢éréson), 12 (eteroun). From the hour of trial (ek tés horas 
tou peirasmou). ‘This use of ek after téred in John 17:15, apo 
in James 1:27. Trial brings temptation often (James 1:2, 
13). Jesus endured (Heb. 12:1f.) and he will help them. 
There is still a church in Philadelphia in spite of the Turks. 
Which is to come (és mellousés erchesthai). Agreeing with 
horas (feminine), not with peirasmou (masculine). Upon the 
whole world (epi tes epoikoumenés holés). The inhabited 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 319 


earth (gés) as in Rev. 12:19; Luke 2:1; Acts 16:6, etc.), not 
the physical earth, but the world of men as explained by 
the next clause. To try (peirasai). First aorist active in- 
finitive of purpose from peirazd, probably to tempt (cf. the 
demons in g:I-21), not merely to afflict (2:10). That dwell 
upon the earth (tous katoikountas epi tés gés). Present active 
articular participle of katoiked, explaining “‘the whole world” 
just before. 

11. [ come quickly (erchomai tachu). As in 2:16; 22:7, 
12, 20. “The keynote of the book” (Beckwith). But 
allow the author’s own meaning of “quickly.” Hold fast 
that which thou hast (kratei ho echeis). Sort of motto for each 
church (2:25). That no one take (hina médeis labéi). Pur- 
pose clause with Aina and second aorist active subjunctive of 
lambano. Here to take away “thy crown” (2:10) which will 
be thine if really won and not forfeited by failure (II Tim. 
4:8). In that case it will go to another (Matt. 25:28; Rom. 
11:17f.). 

12. He that overcometh (ho nikin). Nominative absolute 
as in 2:26, resumed by the accusative auton (him). 4 pillar 
(stulon). Old word for column, in N.T. only here, 10:1; 
Gal. 2:9; I Tim. 3:15. Metaphorical and personal use with 
a double significance of being firmly fixed and giving stability 
to the building. Philadelphia was a city of earthquakes. 
“Temple” (zaos) here is also metaphorical (7:15), as in 
I Tim. 3:15 for the people of God. In 21:22 we read that 
there is no temple in the heavenly Jerusalem (21:10-22:5) 
descending as the new Jerusalem with God himself as the 
temple, though the metaphorical temple is mentioned in 7:15. 
He shall go out thence no more (exd ou mé elthéi). Strong 
double negative ou mé with the second aorist active subjunc- 
tive of erchomai. The subject is ho nikon (the one over- 
coming). “Fixity of character is at last achieved” (Charles). 
He, like the stulos (pillar), remains in place. Upon him 
(ep’ auton). Upon ho nikon (the victor), not upon the pillar 


320 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(stulos). He receives this triple name (of God, of the city of 
God, of Christ) on his forehead (14:1; 7:3; 17:5; 22:4) just 
as the high-priest wore the name of Jehovah upon his fore- 
head (Ex. 28:36, 38), the new name (2:17), without any 
magical or talismanic power, but as proof of ownership by 
God, as a citizen of the New Jerusalem, with the new symbol 
of the glorious personality of Christ (Rev. 19:12), in contrast 
with the mark of the beast on others (13:17; 14:17). For 
citizenship in God’s city see Gal. 4:26; Phil. 3:20; Heb. 11:10; 
12:22; 13:14. The new Ferusalem (tes kainés Ierousalém). 
Not neas (young), but kainés (fresh). See also 21:2, 10 and 
already Gal. 4:26 and Heb. 12:22. Charles distinguishes 
between the Jerusalem before the final judgment and this 
new Jerusalem after thatevent. Perhapsso! In the Apoca- 
lypse always this form Jerousalém (3:12; 21:2, 10), but in 
John’s Gospel Hierosoluma (1:19, etc.). Which cometh down 
(hé katabainousa). Nominative case in apposition with the 
preceding genitive poleds as in 1:5; 2:20, etc. Mine own new 
name (to onoma mou to kainon). For which see 2:17; 19:12, 
16. Christ himself will receive a new name along with all 
else in the future world (Gressmann). 

14. In Laodicea (en Laodikiai). Forty miles south-east of 
Philadelphia and some forty miles east of Ephesus, the last 
of the seven churches addressed with special messages, on 
the river Lycus on the border of Phrygia, near Colossz and 
Hierapolis, recipient of two letters by Paul (Col. 4:16), on 
the great trade-route from Ephesus to the east and seat of 
large manufacturing and banking operations (especially of 
woollen carpets and clothing, Ramsay, Cities and Bishoprics 
of Phrygia, p. 4off.), centre of the worship of Asklepios and 
seat of a medical school and also of a provincial court where 
Cicero lived and wrote many of his letters, home of many 
Jews, called by Ramsay (op. cit., p. 413) “the City of Com- 
promise,” the church here founded apparently by Epaphras 
(Col. 1:7; 4:12f.), now a deserted ruin, one of six cities with 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 321 


this name (meaning justice of the people). No praise is 

bestowed on this church, but only blame for its lukewarm- 

ness. The Amen (ho Amén). Personal (masculine article) 

name here alone, though in Is. 65:16 we have “the God of 

Amen” understood in the LXX as “‘the God of truth”’ (ton 

theon ton aléthinon). Here applied to Christ. See 1:5 for 

ho martus ho pistos (the faithful witness) and 3:7 for ho a/e- 

thinos (the genuine), ‘““whose testimony never falls short of 
the truth” (Swete). The beginning of the creation of God (hé 
arché tes ktiseds tou theou). Not the first of creatures as the 

Arians held and Unitarians do now, but the originating 
source of creation through whom God works (Col. 1:15, 18,. 
a passage probably known to the Laodiceans, John 1:3; Heb. 

¥-oJ-asis;madeclearsby, 1 2185 (228393 3215 15:313)s 

15. Neither cold (oute psuchros). Old word from psucho, 
to grow cold (Matt. 24:12), in N.T. only Matt. 10:42 and this 
passage. Nor hot (oute zestos). Late verbal from zed, to boil, 
(Rom. 12:11), boiling hot, here only in N.T. J would thou 
wert (ophelon és). Wish about the present with ophelon 
(really Gphelon, second aorist active indicative of ophezlo, 
without augment) with the imperfect és (instead of the in- 
finitive) as in II Cor. 11:1, when the old Greek used ezthe or et 
gar. SeeI Cor. 4:8 for the aorist indicative and Gal. 5:12 for 
the future. 

16. Lukewarm (chliaros). Tepid. Old adjective from chiia, 
to liquefy, to melt, here alone in N.T. J will (mello). “I 
am about to,” on the point of. Spew thee (se emesai). First 
aorist active infinitive of emed, old verb to vomit, to reject 
with extreme disgust, here alone in N.T. 

17. I am rich (hoti plousios eimi). Recitative hoti like 
quotation marks before direct quotation. Old adjective 
from ploutos, riches, wealth. Laodicea was a wealthy city 
and the church “carried the pride of wealth into its 
spiritual life” (Swete). Have gotten riches (peploutéka). Per- 
fect active indicative of plouted, old verb from ploutos, used 


322 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


here of imagined spiritual riches which the church did not 
possess, just the opposite of church in Smyrna (poor in 
wealth, rich in grace). This church was in a rich city and 
was rich in pride and conceit, but poor in grace and ignorant 
of its spiritual poverty (ouk oidas, knowest not). The 
wretched one (ho talaiporos). Old adjective from ¢lad, to 
endure, and péros, a callus, afflicted, in N.T. only here and 
Rom. 7:24. Note the one article in the predicate with all 
these five adjectives unifying the picture of sharp emphasis 
on “thou” (sz), “thou that boastest.” Miserable (eleeinos). 
Pitiable as in I Cor. 15:19. Poor (ptachos). See 2:9 for 
spiritual poverty. Perhaps some local example of self-com- 
placency is in mind. Blind (tuphios). Spiritual blindness 
as often (Matt. 23:17), and note “‘eye-salve” in verse 18. 
Naked (gumnos). “The figure completes the picture of 
actual poverty” (Beckwith). See 15 and 16. 

18. [ counsel (sumbouleud). Present active indicative, old 
compound from sumboulos, counsellor (Rom. 11:34), as in 
John 18:14. Almost ironical in tone. To buy (agorasai). 
First aorist active infinitive of agorazd (from agora, market- 
place), rich as they think themselves to be. From me (par’ 
emou). Krom my side, emphatic. Refined by fire (pepuré- 
menon ek puros). Perfect passive participle of purod (as in 
1:15) and the metaphor carried on by ek puros, “fired by 
fire.” Purity by removing dross (Ps. 66:10) like I Pet. ery. 
That thou mayest become rich (hina ploutéséis). Purpose - 
clause with hina and the ingressive first aorist active of 
plouteo, spiritual riches. That thou mayest clothe thyself 
(Aina peribaléi). Purpose clause with hina and second aorist 
middle (direct) subjunctive of periballa, to fling round one as 
in 3:5. Be not made manifest (mé phanerathéi). Continued 
purpose clause with negative mé and first aorist passive sub- 
junctive of phanerod. Nakedness (gumnotétos). Late and 
rare word from gumnos, naked, in N.T. only here, II Cor. 


11:27; Rom. 8:35. Cf. Rev. 16:15; 20:13; II Cor. 5:2f. Eye- 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 323 


salve (kollourion). Diminutive of kollura (coarse bread of 
cylindrical shape), object of agorasai, name for a famous 
Phrygian powder for the eyes made in Laodicea (Charles), 
Latin collyrium (used for eye-salve by Horace and Juvenal). 
To anoint (egchrisai).. First aorist active infinitive (epexe- 
getic) of egchrid, late compound (en, chrid, Strabo, Epictetus), 
to rub in, here only in N.T. That thou mayest see (hine 
blepeis). Another purpose clause with hina and the present 
active subjunctive (keep on seeing). 

19. Free rendering of Prov. 3:12 (in Heb. 12:6), but with 

hous ean (indefinite relative plural) for hon (definite relative 
singular), with pAilé instead of agapai and with the first - 
person paideud for paideuei (the Lord chastens, from pais, 
child, training a child) and with e/egché (reprove) added. Be 
zealous (zéleue). Present active imperative of zé/eud, in good 
sense (from zé/os, zed, to boil), in opposition to their luke- 
warmness, here only in N.T. (elsewhere 22/00), “keep on 
being zealous.” Repent (metanoéson). Ingressive first aorist 
active imperative of metanoed. 
_ 20. I stand at the door (hestéka epi tén thuran). Perfect 
active of histémi (intransitive). Picture of the Lord’s advent 
as in Matt. 24:33; James 5:9, but true also of the individual 
response to Christ’s call (Luke 12:36) as shown in Holman 
Hunt’s great picture. Some see a use also of Song of Solo- 
mon 5:2. If any man hear—and open (ean tis akouséi kai 
anoixei). Condition of third class with eam and first aorist 
(ingressive) active subjunctive of akoud and anoigd. See 
John 10:3; 18:37. See the picture reversed (Swete) in Luke 
13:25 and Matt. 25:10. J will come in to him (eiseleusomai). 
Future middle of ezserchomai. See Mark 15:43; Acts 11:3 
for eiserchomai pros, to go into a man’s house. Cf. John 
14:23. Will sup (deipnéso). Future active of deipned, old 
verb, from deipnon (supper), asin Luke 17:8. Fellowship in 
the Messianic kingdom (Luke 22:30; Mark 14:25; Matt. 
26:29). Purely metaphorical, as is plain from I Cor. 6:13. 


324 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


21. He that overcometh (ho nikon). Absolute nominative 
again as in 3:12, but resumed this time by the dative autoi 
as in 2:26. To sit (kathisai). First aorist active infinitive 
of kathizd. This promise grows out of the prophecy that the 
saints will share in the Messiah’s rule, made to the twelve 
(Matt. 19:28; Luke 22:20f.), repeated by Paul (I Cor. 6:2f.), 
enlarged in Rev. 22:1-5 (to last forever, II Tim. 2:11f.). 
James and John took this hope and promise literally (Mark 
10:40) not metaphorically. 4s I also overcame (hos kago 
enikésa). First aorist active indicative of nikad, looking 
back on the victory as over in the past. In John 16:33 
before the Cross Jesus says Egd nenikéka ton kosmon (perfect 
active), emphasizing the abiding effect of the victory. Sat 
down (ekathisa). “I took my seat” (Heb. 1:3) where Christ 
is now (Rev. 22:3; Col. 3:1). Cf. I John 5:4; Rev. 2:27f. 
Each of these seven messages begins alike and ends alike. 
Each is the message of the Christ and of the Holy Spirit 
to the angel of the church. Each has a special message 
suited to the actual condition of each church. In each case 
the individual who overcomes has a promise of blessing. 
Christ the Shepherd knows his sheep and lays bare the par- 


ticular peril in each case. 


CHAPTER IV 


1. After these things (meta tauta). Change in the pano- 
rama, not chronology (7:1, 9; 15:5; 18:1; 19:1). This vision 
is of heaven, not of earth as was true of chapters 1 and 2. 
The first vision of Christ and the messages to the seven 
churches began in 1:12f. This new vision of the throne in 
heaven (4:1-11) succeeds that to which it here alludes. J 
saw (eidon). Second aorist active indicative of horad. Be- 
hold (idou). Exclamation of vivid emotion as John looked. 
No effect on the structure and nominative case ¢hura (door) 
follows it. Opened (énedigmené). Perfect (triple reduplication) 
passive participle of avoigé as in 3:8 (door of opportunity) 
and 3:20 (door of the heart), here the door of revelation 
(Swete). In heaven (en toi ourandi). As in Ezek. 1:1; Mark 
1:10; John 1:51. In Revelation always in singular except 
12:12. The first (hé prote). Reference is to 1:10. Speaking 
(lalousés). From Jaleé, rather legousés of 1:10 from /egd, both 
agreeing with sa/piggos (trumpet). Saying (/egon). Present 
active participle of /egd repeating the idea of Jalousés, but 
in the nominative masculine singular construed with phoné 
(feminine singular), construction according to sense because 
of the person behind the voice as in 11:15; 19:14. Come up 
(anaba). Short Koiné form for anabdéthi (second aorist active 
imperative second person singular of anabaind). Hither 
(hode). Originally ‘“‘here,” but vernacular use (John 6:25; 
10:27). J will show (deixo). Future active of detknumi in 
same sense in 1:1. Hereafter (meta tauta). Some editors 
(Westcott and Hort) connect these words with the beginning 
of verse 2. 

2. Straightway I was in the Spirit (eutheds egenomén en 
pneumati). But John had already “come to be in the 

325 


326 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Spirit” (1:10, the very same phrase). Perhaps here effective 
aorist middle indicative while ingressive aorist in 1:10 (sequel 
or result, not entrance), ‘“‘At once I found myself in the 
Spirit”? (Swete), not “I came to be in the Spirit”’ as in 1:10. 
Was set (ekeito). Imperfect middle of keimai, old verb, used 
as passive of tithémi. As the vision opens John sees the 
throne already in place as the first thing in heaven. This 
bold imagery comes chiefly from I Kings 22:19; Is. 6:1ff.; 
Ezek. 1:26-28; Dan. 7:9f. One should not forget that this 
language is glorious imagery, not actual objects in heaven. 
God is spirit. The picture of God on the throne is common 
in the O.T. and the N.T. (Matt. 5:34f.; 23:22; Heb. 1:3 and 
in nearly every chapter in the Revelation, 1:4, etc.). The 
use of kathémenos (sitting) for the name of God is like the 
Hebrew avoidance of the name Yahweh and is distinguished 
from the Son in 6:16 and 7:10. Upon the throne (epi ton 
thronon). Epi with the accusative, as in 4:4; 6:2, 4f.; 11:16; 
20:4, but in verses g and 10, 4:1, 7, 13; 6:16; 7:15 we have 
epi tou thronou (genitive), while in 7:10; 19:14; 21:5 we have 
epi toi thronoi (locative) with no great distinction in the 
resultant idea. 

3. To look upon (horasei). WLocative case of horasis, old 
word (from horaé, to see) for appearance (in appearance) as 
in Ezek. 1:5, 26. Like a jasper stone (homoios iaspidi). As- 
sociative-instrumental case of iaspis, old word (Persian), 
used for stones of different colors, one opaque like opal, one 
translucent (21:11, 18f.; possibly here, only N.T. examples), 
one a red or yellow stone (Is. 54:12). Some even take it for 
the diamond. Certainly not our cheap modern jasper. 4 
sardius (sardioi). Old word, in N.T. only here and 21:20. 
The carnelian or other red stone, derived from Sardis (Pliny). 
Rainbow (iris). Old word, in N.T. only here and 10:1. 
From Ezek. 1:28. 4n emerald (smaragdindi). Adjective 
(from smaragdos, Rev. 21:19), of emerald (supply /ithdi), in 
associative instrumental case after homoios. John sees no 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 327 


form for God (Ex. 24:10), but only the brilliant flashing 
gems. “In the vision the flashing lustre of the iaspis and 
the fiery red of the sard are-relieved by the halo (iris) of 
emerald which encircled the Throne” (Swete). A complete 
circle. ; 
4. Round about the throne (kuklothen tou thronou). Here 
as a preposition with the genitive, though only adverb in 
4:8 (only N.T. examples save Textus Rec. in 5:11). Four 
and twenty thrones (thronoi etkosi tessares). So P Q, but 
Aleph A have accusative ¢hronous (supply eidon from 4:1) 
and ¢essares (late accusative in -es). This further circle of 
thrones beyond the great throne. J saw four and twenty 
elders (eikosi tessaras presbuterous). No eidon in the text, 
but the accusative case calls for it. Twenty-four as a 
symbolic number occurs only in this book and only for 
these elders (4:4, 10; 5:8; 11:16; 19:4). We do not really 
know why this number is chosen, perhaps two elders for 
each tribe, perhaps the twelve tribes and the twelve apostles 
(Judaism and Christianity), perhaps the twenty-four courses 
of the sons of Aaron (I Chron. 24:1-19), perhaps some angelic 
rank (Col. 1:16) of which we know nothing. Cf. Eph. 2:6. 
Sitting (kathémenous). Upon their thrones. Arrayed (peri- 
beblemenous). Perfect passive participle of peridalld (to 
throw around). In white garments (himatiois leukois). Loca- 
tive case here as in 3:5 (with ev), though accusative in 7:9, 
13. Crowns of gold (stephanous chrusous). Accusative case 
again like presbuterous after eidon (4:1), not idou. In 19:14 
echon (having) is added. John uses diadéma (diadem) for 
the kingly crown in 12:3; 13:1; 19:12, but it is not certain 
that the old distinction between diadem as the kingly crown 
and stephanos as the victor’s wreath is always observed in 
late Greek. 

5. Out of the throne (ek tou thronou). Back to the throne 
itself. The imagery is kin to that in Ex. 19:16; 24:9f.; 
Ezek. 1:22, 27. Proceed (ekporeuontai). Graphic historical 


328 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


present. Lightnings and voices and thunders (astrapai kat 
phonai kai brontai). So exactly in 11:19; 16:18, but in 8:5 
with drontai first, astrapai last, all old and common words. 
“The thunderstorm is in Hebrew poetry a familiar symbol 
of the Divine power: cf., e.g., I Sam. 2:10; Ps. 18:9f.; Job 
37:4f.” (Swete). Seven lamps of fire (hepta lampades puros). 
Return to the nominative (idou, not eidon) with ésan (were) 
understood. Metaphor drawn from Ezek. 1:13 and Zech. 
4:12ff. Our word “lamp,” but here a torch as in 8:10, 
identified with the Holy Spirit (the Seven Spirits of God) 
as in 1:4; 3:1, not /uchniai (lampstands) as in 1:12, 20, nor 
luchnos a hand-lamp with oil (Matt. 5:15). ‘‘These torches 
blaze perpetually before the throne of God” (Swete). 

6. As it were a glassy sea (hos thalassa hualiné). Old 
adjective (from hualos, glass, 21:18, 21), in N.T. only here 
and 15:2. Possibly from hwei (it rains), like a raindrop. 
At any rate here it is the appearance, not the material. 
Glass was made in Egypt 4,000 years ago. In Ex. 24:10 the 
elders see under the feet of God in the theophany a paved 
work of sapphire stone (cf. Ezek. 1:26). The likeness of the 
appearance of sky to sea suggests the metaphor here (Beck- 
with). Like crystal (homoia krustalloi). Associative-instru- 
mental case after homoia. Old word, from kruos (ice and 
sometimes used for ice), in N.T. only here and 22:1, not 
semiopaque, but clear like rock-crystal. In the midst of 
the throne (en mesoi tou thronou). As one looks from the © 
front, really before. Round about the throne (kukléi tou 
thronou). Merely an adverb in the locative case (Rom. 
15:19), as a preposition in N.T. only here, 5:11; 7:11. This 
seems to mean that on each of ihe four sides of the throne 
was one of the four living creatures either stationary or mov- 
ing rapidly round (Ezek. 1:12f.). Four living creatures 
(tessera z0a). Not théria (beasts), but living creatures. Cer- 
tainly kin to the zd¢ of Ezek. 1 and 2 which are cherubim 
(Ezek. 10:2, 20), though here the details vary as to faces 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 329 


and wings with a significance of John’s own, probably rep- 
resenting creation in contrast with the redeemed (the elders). 
Full of eyes (gemonta ophthalmon). Present active participle 
of gemé, to be full of, with the genitive, signifying here un- 
limited intelligence (Beckwith), the ceaseless vigilance of 
nature (Swete). 

7. Like a lion (homoion leonti). Associative-instrumental 
case again. In Ezek. (1:6, 10) each 200m has four faces, but 
here each has a different face. “The four forms represent 
whatever is noblest, strongest, wisest, and swiftest in na- 
ture” (Swete). But it is not necessary to try to find a 
symbolism in each face here like the early baseless identifica- 
tion with the Four Evangelists (the lion for Mark, the man 
for Matthew, the calf for Luke, the eagle for John). Moschos 
is first a sprout, then the young of animals, then a calf 
(bullock or heifer) as in Luke 15:23, 27, 30, or a full-grown 
ox (Ezek. 1:10). Had (echon). Masculine singular (some 
MSS. echon neuter singular agreeing with 2007) present ac- 
tive participle of echd, changing the construction with the 
triton zoon almost like a finite verb as in verse 8. 4 face 
as of a man (prosipon hos anthrépou). Shows that the like- 
ness in each instance extended only to the face. Like an 
eagle flying (homoion aetoi petomendi). Present middle par- 
ticiple of petomai, to fly, old verb, in N.T. only in Rev. 
4:7; 8:13; 12:14; 14:6; 19:17. The aetos in Matt. 24:28 and 
Luke 17:37 may be a form of vulture going after carrion, 
but not in Rev. 8:13; 12:14. 

8. Each one of them (hen kath’ hen auton). ‘““One by one 
of them,” a vernacular idiom like heis kata heis in Mark 
14:19. Having (echoén). Masculine participle again as in 
verse 7, though zdon neuter. Six wings (ana pterugas hex). 
Distributive use of ana, “‘six wings apiece” as in Luke 10:1 
(ana duo, by twos). Like Is. 6:2, not like Ezek. 1:6, where 
only four wings are given apiece. Are full of (gemousin), 
Plural verb, though zd¢ neuter, to individualize each one. 


330 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Round about and within (kuklothen kai esothen). Perhaps 
before and behind (4:6) and under the wings, “pointing to 
the secret energies of nature” (Swete). Rest (anapausin). 
See also 14:11. Old word (from anapaud, to relax), as in 
Matt. 11:29. God and Christ cease not their activity (John 
5:17). “This ceaseless activity of nature under the hand 
of God is a ceaseless tribute of praise” (Swete). Day and 
night (hémeras kai nuktos). Genitive of time, by day and 
by night. Holy, holy, holy (hagios, hagios, hagios). “The 
task of the Cherubim together with the Seraphim and 
Ophannim is to sing the praises of God” (Charles) in the 
trisagion (triple repetition of hagios). Is the Lord God 
(Kurios ho theos). See Is. 6:3. The copula estin (is) is not 
expressed, but is implied. The Almighty (ho pantokrator). 
See on 1:8. Which was and which is and which is to come 
(ho én kai ho in kai ho erchomenos). Just as in 1:4, 8, but 
with the order changed. 

9. When the living creatures shall give (hotan dosousin ta 
z0a). Indefinite temporal clause with hotan and the future 
active indicative (ddsousin) rather than the more common 
second aorist active subjunctive (ddsin) with the notion of 
repetition rather than unbroken continuance, “whenever 
they give.” The giving of praise and glory to God by the 
four living creatures (representatives of nature) is met by 
corresponding worship by the redeemed (the four and twenty . 
elders). “‘Created life adores the Uncreated”’ (Swete), “to 
the one living for ages of ages.” 

10. Shall fall down (pesountai, future middle of pipto), 
shall worship (proskunésousin, future active of proskuned), 
shall cast their crowns (balousin tous stephanous, future ac- 
tive of dallo). The two actions by the two groups (living 
creatures, elders) are codrdinated (simultaneous in the rep- 
etition). They thus acknowledge that all this kingly dig- 
nity comes from God, who is King of kings and Lord ‘of 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 331 


lords. Charles takes the elders, however, to be angels, not 
redeemed men. 

11. Our Lord and our God (ho kurios kai ho theos hémon). 
The nominative form here used as vocative as in John 20:28 
and often. To receive (Jabein). Epexegetic second aorist 
active infinitive of Jambano with axios (worthy). The glory 
(ten doxan). The article referring to doxan in verse g and 
so with fé7 timén (the honour), though ¢én dunamin (the 
power) is not in verse g, but is the power due to be ascribed 
to God. Thou didst create (su ektisas). Emphasis on su 
(thou), first aorist active indicative of ktizd, the verb used 
about the act of creation by Paul in Col. 1:16 (ektisthé, 
ektistai), constative aorist giving a summary picture of the 
whole (not as a process). Because of thy will (dia to thelema 
sou). Reason for creation of the universe as in Heb. 2:10 
(di’ hon). They were (@san). Imperfect tense with a cursory 
glance at the universe as a fact, possibly a potential ex- 
istence in God’s purpose in the eternal past before the actual 
creation in time. And were created (kai ektisthésan). First 
aorist passive indicative of the same verb, fiz0, just used 
and in the plural, while Paul (Col. 1:16) uses the singular 
ektisthe. See I Cor. 8:6. God’s will wrought through the 
Logos (Christ). 


GHAPTERGY 


1. In the right hand (epi tén dexian). “Upon the right 
hand”’ (epi, not ez), the open palm. Anthropomorphic lan- 
guage drawn from Ezek. 2:9f. 4 book (diblion). Diminu- 
tive of didlos, but no longer so used, diblaridion occurring 
instead (10:2). Written (gegrammenon). Perfect passive 
predicate participle of graphd. Within and on the back 
(esothen kai opisthen). ‘‘Within and behind.” Description 
of a roll like that in Luke 4:17, not a codex as some scholars 
think. Usually these papyrus rolls were written only on the 
inside, but this one was so full of matter that it was written 
also on the back side (opisthen), and so was an opisthographon 
like that in Ezek. 2:10. There are many allegorical interpre- 
tations of this fact which are all beside the point. Sealed 
(katesphragismenon). Perfect passive predicate participle of 
katasphragizo, old compound (perfective use of kata), to seal 
up (down), here only in N.T. With seven seals (sphragisin 
hepta). Instrumental case of sphragis, old word used in 
various senses, proof or authentication (I Cor. 9:2; Rom. 
4:11), signet-ring (Rev. 7:2), impression made by the seal 
(Rev. 9:4; II Tim. 2:19), the seal on books closing the book 
(Rev. 5:1, 2, 5, 93 6:1, 3, 5) 7, 9) 12; 8:1). “‘A will in Roman - 
law bore the seven seals of the seven witnesses”’ (Charles). 
But this sealed book of doom calls for no witnesses beyond 
God’s own will. Alford sees in the number seven merely 
the completeness of God’s purposes. 

2. 4 strong angel (aggelon ischuron). One needed (10:1; 
18:21) “whose call could reach to the farthest limits of the 
universe” (Beckwith) and so ‘“‘with a great voice” (en 
phonéi megaléi, in a great voice, as in 14:7, 9, 15, and with- 
out ¢” 5:12; 6:10; 7:2, 10; 8:13; 10:3, etc.). See en ischurai 

332 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 333 


phonéi (18:2). Proclaiming (kérussonta). Present active 
predicate participle of kérussd, to herald, to preach. Worthy 
to open and to loose (axios anoixai kai lusai). Worthy by 
rank and character (cf. John 1:27) as well as by ability 
(edunato, verse 3), followed by two infinitives (first aorist 
active) of anoigd and /ué, though hina and the subjunctive 
can be used after axios as in John 1:27. Here axios is like 
hikanos (capable, qualified) as in Matt. 8:8. The articles 
here (40, tas) refer to the book and the seals in verse 1. It 
is a husteron-proteron, since the loosing of the seals pre- 
cedes the opening of the book. 

3. En (in) with locative (ourandi), epi (apon) with geni- 
tive (gés), hupokato (under) with ablative (gés), as in verse 
13, including the whole universe, as in Ex. 20:4 (Phil. 2:10). 
The MSS. vary in the negative conjunctions after oudeis 
(no one) between oude—oude (continuative, and not—nor) 
and oute—oute (disjunctive, neither—nor). To look thereon 
(6lepein auto). Into the contents of the book. The uni- 
verse declines the challenge. 

4. I wept much (ego eklaion polu). Imperfect active of 
klaid, picturesque, descriptive, I kept on weeping much; 
natural tense in these vivid visions (1:12; 2:14; 5:4, 143 
6:8, 9; 10:10; 19:14; 21:15). Perhaps weeping aloud. Was 
found (heurethé). First aorist passive indicative of heurisko. 
Worthy (axios). Predicative nominative after heurethé. 

5. One of the elders (heis ek ton presbuteron). ‘““One from 
among the elders” of 4:4, 10 (ek with the ablative 8 times 
in the Apocalypse, 12 in the Fourth Gospel, 10 in rest of 
the N.T., in place of the mere partitive genitive). No par- 
ticular reason for one elder as the agent over another (7:13). 
Saith (legei). Dramatic vivid present. Weep not (mé kiaie). 
“Cease weeping” (prohibition with mé and the present ac- 
tive imperative of k/aid. The Lion (ho leon). Satan 1s 
called a lion by Peter (I Pet. 5:8), but the metaphor belongs 
to Jesus also. Judah is called a lion in the blessing of Jacob

(Gen. 49:9) and Jesus as the greatest of the tribe of Judah, 
“the Root of David” (hé riza Daueid, Is. 11:1, 10) or the 
Branch from this root (the Messiah). Hath overcome (ent- 
késen). First aorist active indicative of nikad, “did over- 
come,” coming first in the sentence as “the great historical 
fact of the victory of the Christ” (Swete). 

6. And I saw (kai eidon). Stirred by the words of the 
elder in verse 5 (idou, behold). “I beheld.” In the midst 
(en mesoi). See 4:6 for this idiom. It is not quite clear 
where the Lamb was standing in the vision, whether close 
to the throne or in the space between the throne and the 
elders (perhaps implied by “came” in verse 7, but nearness 
to the throne is implied by 14:1 and Acts 7:56; Heb. 10:11). 
A Lamb (arnion). Elsewhere in the N.T. 4o amnos is used 
of Christ (John 1:29, 36; Acts 8:32; I Pet. 1:19 like Is. 53:7), 
but in the Apocalypse fo arnion occurs for the Crucified 
Christ 29 times in twelve chapters. Standing (hestékos). 
Second perfect active (intransitive of Aist@mi) neuter ac- 
cusative singular (grammatical gender like arnion), though 
some MSS. read hestékés (natural gender masculine and 
nominative in spite of eidon construction according to sense). 
As though it had been slain (hos esphagmenon). Perfect pas- 
sive predicate participle of sphazd, old word, in N.T. only 
in Rev. 5:6, 9, 123 6:4, 93 13:3; 18:24; and I John 3:12. 
Hos (as if) is used because the Lamb is now alive, but (in 
appearance) with the marks of the sacrifice. The Christ as - 
the Lamb is both sacrifice and Priest (Heb. g:12f.; 10:11). 
Having (echon). Construction according to sense again with 
masculine nominative participle instead of echonta (mascu- 
line accusative singular) or echon (neuter accusative singular). 
Seven horns (keras) is a common symbol in the O.T. for 
strength and kingly power (I Sam. 2:10; I Kings 22:11; Ps. 
12:93"Dan.. 7:7; 20ff.)and: often in) Rev..(1223301g 15/1733} 
12). Fulness of power (the All-powerful one) is symbolized 
by seven. Seven eyes (ophthalmous hepta). Like Zech. 3:9; 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 335 


4:10 and denotes here, as there, omniscience. Here they 
are identified with the seven Spirits of Christ, while in 1:4 
the seven Spirits are clearly the Holy Spirit of God (3:1), 
and blaze like torches (4:5), like the eyes of Christ (1:14). 
The Holy Spirit is both Spirit of God and of Christ (Rom. 
8:9). Sent forth (apestalmenoi). Perfect passive predicate 
participle of apostelld, masculine plural (agreeing with hot 
and ophthalmous in gender), but some MSS. have apestal- 
mena agreeing with the nearer pneumata. 

7. He taketh (eil@éphen). Perfect active indicative of /am- 
bané, not used for the aorist (cf. 2/then, he came), but vivid 
dramatic picture of the actual scene, ‘“‘he has taken it.” 

8. He had taken (elaben). Were John drops back to the 
narrative tense (the second aorist active indicative of /am- 
bano), not the past perfect as the English rendering might 
indicate, merely “when he took.”’ For like vivid variation 
(not confusion) of tenses with ei/éphen see 3:3; 8:5; 11:17 and 
with eiréka in 7:13f.; 19:3. Fell down (epesan). Second 
aorist active indicative of piptd with first aorist (-az) ending, 
just “fell.” Having (echontes). “Holding.” Aharp (kitharan). 
Old word, the traditional instrument (lyre or zithern) for 
psalmody (Ps. 33:2; 98:5, etc.). Golden bowls (phialas 
chrusas). Broad shallow saucers, old word, in N.T. only 
in Rev. 5:8; 15:7; 16:1-4, 8, 10, 12, 17; 17:1; 21:9. Of 
incense (thumiamaton). Old word from thumiad, to burn 
incense (Luke 1:9), as in Luke 1:10. Which are (hai eisin). 
““Which (these bowls of incense) symbolize the prayers of 
the saints” as in Ps. 140:2; Luke 1:10. 

g. They sing (aidousin). Present active indicative of 
aido. Old verb, to chant with lyrical emotion (Col. 3:16. 
A new song (didén kainén). Cognate accusative for oide 
(did@, song) is Zoide from Geidd, that is dido (the verb used), 
old word already used (Col. 3:16; Eph. 5:19), called kainén 
because a fresh song for new mercies (Is. 42:10; Ps. 33:33 
4033, etc.), here in praise of redemption to Christ (14:3) like 


336 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


the new name (2:17; 3:12), the new Jerusalem (3:12; 21:2), 
the new heaven and the new earth (21:1), not the old song of 
creation (4:8, 11) toGod. For thou wast slain (hoti esphagés). 
Second aorist passive indicative of sphazd. Agorazd used by 
Paul and Peter of our purchase from sin by Christ (I Cor. 
Gr203h7223 Gal zinqeeyisss Ti PetmmengeciiiePersis 18192 
Unto God (toi thedi). Dative case of advantage as also in 
verse 10. With thy blood (en toi haimati sou). Instrumental 
use of em as in 1:5. The blood of Christ as the price of our 
redemption runs all through the Apocalypse. This is the 
reason why Christ is worthy to “take the book and open 
its seals.” That is, he is worthy to receive adoration and 
worship (4:11) as the Father does. Men of every (ek pasés). 
No anthropous (men) or tinas (some) before ek in the Greek. 
See a like ellipsis in 11:9 with a like grouping of words for 
all mankind, representatives of all races and nations (7:9; 
1BR7S) LAO) 

10. Madest (epoiésas). First aorist active indicative of 
poied, a prophetic use anticipating the final result. 4 king- 
dom and priests (basileian kai hiereis). As the correct text in 
1:6. They reign (basileuousin). Present active indicative, 
futuristic use, though Aleph P have the future Jasileusousin 
(shall reign) as in 20:6. 

11. And I saw (kai eidon). A new feature introduced by 
the outer and vaster circle (kuk/0i) of angels who catch up 
the new song of redemption in antiphonal singing, answering 
the song of the four living creatures and the twenty-four 
elders. Some MSS. read ds (as if) before phdnén (voice). 
Ten thousand times ten thousand (muriades muriadon kai 
chiliades chiliadon). Literally, “myriads of myriads and 
thousands of thousands,” a mild husteron-proteron. The 
regular order in I Enoch 40:1. See Dan. 7:10 for chiliai 
chiliades (thousand thousands) and muriai muriades (count- 
less myriads). They are all efforts to express the innumer- 
able hosts of the angels. 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 337 


12. Worthy (axion). Agreeing in gender (grammatical 
neuter) with arnion, but some MSS. have axios (masculine, 
natural gender). Note change to third person estin instead 
of second ei. The point of the song is the same as that in 
verses g and Io, but the language differs. Note the repeated 
article fo (the lamb the slain) referring to verses 6 and 9. 
Note also the one article #én before dunamin for all the seven 
grounds of praise (dunamin, power, plouton, wealth, sophian, 
wisdom, ischun, strength, timén, honor, doxan, glory, eulo- 
gian, blessing), though p/outon is masculine, in contrast with 
separate article for each item (all three feminine) in 4:11, 
here grouping them all together, “a heptad of praise” 
(Swete). 

13. Every created thing (pan ktisma). Every creature in a 
still wider antiphonal circle beyond the circle of angels 
(from ktizd, for which see I Tim. 4:4; James 1:18), from all 
the four great fields of life (in heaven, upon the earth, under 
the earth as in verse 3, with on the sea epi tés thalassés 
added). No created thing is left out. This universal 
chorus of praise to Christ from all created life reminds one 
of the profound mystical passage in Rom. 8:20-22 con- 
cerning the sympathetic agony of creation (kfisis) in hope 
of freedom from the bondage of corruption. If the trail of 
the serpent is on all creation, it will be ultimately thrown off. 
Saying (legontas). Masculine (construction according to 
sense, personifying the created things) if genuine, though 
some MSS. have J/egonta (grammatical gender agreeing with 
panta) present active participle of /egd, to say. And to the 
Lamb (kai toi arnidi). Dative case. Praise and worship 
are rendered to the Lamb precisely as to God on the throne. 
Note separate articles here in the doxology as in 4:11 and the 
addition of to kratos (active power) in place of ischus (reserve 
of strength) in 5:12. 

14. 4men (Amén). The four living creatures give their 
approval to the doxology after the antiphonal songs Fe/I 


338 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


down and worshipped (epesan kai prosekunésan). In silent 
adoration that closes the whole service of praise to the One 
upon the throne and to the Lamb. As in 4:10 so here the 
representatives of the redeemed bow in silent worship. 
Pliny says that the Christians sing a song to Christ as to 
God. He is here worshipped by the universe (Phil. 2:10f.). 


CHAPTER VI 


1. And I saw (kai eidon). As in 4:1; 5:1. The vision 
unfolds without anything being said about opening the book 
and reading from it. Ina more vivid and dramatic fashion 
the Lamb breaks the seals one by one and reveals the contents 
and the symbolism. The first four seals have a common 
note from one of the four za and the appearance of a horse. 
No effort will be made here to interpret these seals as refer- 
ring to persons or historical events in the past, present, or 
future, but simply to relate the symbolism to the other 
symbols in the book. It is possible that there is some allu- 
sion here to the symbolism in the so-called “Little Apoca- 
lypse” of Mark 13=Matt. 24f.= Luke 21. The imagery 
of the four horses is similar to that in Zech. 1:7-11; 6:1-8 
(ef Jer. 14:12; 24:10; 42217)/ In the Old Testament’ ‘the 
horse is often the emblem of war (Job 39:25; Ps. 76:6; 
Prov. 21:31; Ezek. 26:10). “‘Homer pictures the horses of 
Rhesus as whiter than snow, and swift as the wind” (Vin- 
cent). When the Lamb opened (hote énoixen to arnion). First 
aorist active indicative of anoigd. This same phrase recurs 
in rhythmical order at the opening of each seal (6:1, 3, 5,7, 9, 
12) till the last (8:1), where we have hotan énoixen (hotan 
rather than Aofe calling particular attention to it). One 
(mian). Probably used here as an ordinal (the first) as in 
Matt. 28:1. See Robertson, Grammar, p. 671f. Of (ek). 
This use of ek with the ablative in the partitive sense is 
common in the Apocalypse, as twice in this verse (ek #67, etc.). 
So henos ek ton (one of the four living creatures) is “‘the first 
of,” etc. In a voice of thunder (en phonéi brontes). Old word 
used of John and James (Mark 3:17) and elsewhere in N.T. 
only John 12:29 and a dozen times in the Apocalypse. 

339 


340 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Come (Erchou). Present middle imperative of erchomai, but 
with exclamatory force (not strictly linear). The command 
is not addressed to the Lamb nor to John (the correct text 
omits kai ide “and see”) as in 17:1; 21:9, but to one of the 
four horsemen each time. Swete takes it as a call to Christ 
because erchou is so used in 22:17, 20, but that is not con- 
clusive. 

2. And I saw and behold (kai eidon kai idou). This com- 
bination is frequent in the Apocalypse (4:1; 6:2, 5, 8; 14:1, 
14; 19:11). A white horse (hippos leukos). In Zech. 6:1-8 
we have red, black, white, and grizzled bay horses like the 
four winds of heaven, ministers to do God’s will. White 
seems to be the colour of victory (cf. the white horse of the 
Persian Kings) like the white horse ridden by the Roman 
conqueror in a triumphant procession. Had (echon). Agree- 
ing in gender and case with ho kathémenos. A bow (toxon). 
Old word (Zech. 9:13f. of a great bow), here only in N.T. 
Was given (edothé). First aorist passive indicative of didomi. 
A crown (stephanos). See on 4:4 for this word. He came 
forth (exélthen). Second aorist active indicative of exer- 
chomai, either to come out or to go out (went forth). 
Conquering (nikon). Present active participle of nikad. And 
to conquer (kai hina nikéséi). Purpose clause with hina and 
the first aorist active subjunctive of mikad. Here hos 
nikéson (future active participle with 40s) could have been 
used. The aorist tense here points to ultimate victory. . 
Commentators have been busy identifying the rider of the 
white horse according to their various theories. “It is 
tempting to identify him with the Rider on the white horse 
in 19:11f., whose name is ‘the Word of God’” (Swete). 
Tempting “but the two riders have nothing in common 
beyond the white horse.” 

3. The second seal (tén sphragida tén deuteran). ‘The 
seal the second.” The white horse with his rider vanished 
from the scene. bent on his conquering career. 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 341 


4. 4 red horse (hippos purros). Old adjective from pur 
(fire), flame-coloured, blood-red (II Kings 3:22), in N.T. 
only here and 12:3, like Zech. 1:8; 6:2 (roan horse). To take 
peace from the earth (labein tén eirénén ek tés gés). Second 
aorist active infinitive of Jamband, and here the nominative 
case, the subject of edothé (see verse 2), “‘to take peace out of 
the earth.” Alas, how many red horses have been ridden 
through the ages. dnd that they should slay one another (kat 
hina allélous sphaxousin). Epexegetical explanatory pur- 
pose clause with Aina and the future active of sphazd (5:6) 
instead of the more usual subjunctive (verse 2). Cf. Rob- 
ertson, Grammar, p. 998f. This is what war does to per-. 
fection, makes cannon fodder (cf. John 14:27) of men. 
A great sword (machaira megalé). Machaira may be a knife 
carried in a sheath at the girdle (John 18:10) or a long sword 
in battle as here. Romphaia, also a large sword, is the only 
other word for sword in the N.T. (Rev. 1:16; 2:12, 16; 6:85 
19%15, 21). 

5. A black horse (hippos melas). Lust of conquest brings 
bloodshed, but also famine and hunger. “The colour of 
mourning and famine. See Jer. 4:28; 8:21; Mal. 3:14, where 
mournfully is, literally, in black” (Vincent). Had (echon) 
as in verse 2. 4 balance (zugon). Literally, a yoke (old 
word from zeugnumi, to join), of slavery (Acts 15:10; Gal. 
s:1), of teaching (Matt. 11:29), of weight or measure like a 
pair of scales evenly balancing as here (Ezek. 5:1; 45:10). 
The rider of this black horse, like the spectral figure of 
hunger, carries in his hand a pair of scales. This is also one 
of the fruits of war. 

6. As it were a voice (hos phonén). ‘This use of hds, giving 
a certain vagueness or mysteriousness to a phrase, is one of 
the characteristics of the writer’s style, e.g., 8:1; 14:33 19:1, 
6” (Beckwith). This voice comes from the midst of the 
four living creatures, “‘the protest of nature against the 
horrors of famine” (Swete). 4 measure (choinix). Old word 


342 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


for less than a quart with us, here only in N.T. Of wheat 
(sitou). Old word for wheat, a number of times in N.T., 
in Rev. only here and 18:13. This was enough wheat to 
keep a man of moderate appetite alive for a day. For a 
penny (dénariou). Genitive of price, the wages of a day 
laborer (Matt. 20:2), about eighteen cents in our money 
today. Of barley (krithon). Old word krithé, usually in 
plural as here. Barley was the food of the poor and it was 
cheaper even in the famine and it took more of it to support 
life. Here the proportion is three to one (cf. II Kings 7:18). 
The proclamation forbids famine prices for food (solid and 
liquid). Hurt thou not (mé adikéséis). Prohibition with mé 
and the ingressive first aorist active subjunctive of adiked. 
See 7:3 and 9:4 for adiked for injury to vegetable life. “The 
prohibition is addressed to the nameless rider who represents 
Dearth” (Swete). Wheat and barley, oil and the vine, were 
the staple foods in Palestine and Asia Minor. 

8. A pale horse (hippos chloros). Old adjective. Con- 
tracted from chloeros (from chloé, tender green grass) used 
of green grass (Mark 6:39; Rev. 8:7; 9:4), here for yellowish, 
common in both senses in old Greek, though here only in 
N.T. in this sense, greenish yellow. We speak of a sorrel 
horse, never of a green horse. Zechariah (6:3) uses poikilos 
(grizzled or variegated). Homer used chléros of the ashen 
colour of a face blanched by fear (pallid) and so the pale 
horse is a symbol of death and of terror. His name was - 
Death (onoma autoi ho thanatos). Anacoluthon in gram- 
matical structure like that in John 3:1 (cf. Rev. 2:26) and 
common enough. Death is the name of this fourth rider (so 
personified) and there is with Death “his inseparable com- 
rade, Hades (1:16; 20:13f.)”” (Swete). Hades (Adidés, alpha 
privative, and idein, to see, the unseen) is the abode of the 
dead, the keys of which Christ holds (Rev. 1:18). Followed 
(2kolouthei). Imperfect active of akolouthed, kept step with 
death, whether on the same horse or on another horse by 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 343 


his side or on foot John does not say. Over the fourth part 
of the earth (epi to tetarton tes ges). Partitive genitive gés 
after fetarton. Wider authority (exousia) was given to this 
rider than to the others, though what part of the earth is 
included in the fourth part is not indicated. To kill (apok- 
teinat). Wirst aorist active infinitive of apokteind, explana- 
tion of the exousia (authority). The four scourges of Ezek. 
14:21 are here reproduced with instrumental en with the 
inanimate things (romphaidi, limoi thanatoi) and hupo for 
the beasts (théridn). Death here (thanatoi) seems to mean 
pestilence as the Hebrew does (/oimos—cf. limos famine). 
Cf. the “‘black death” for a plague. 

g. Under the altar (hupokato tou thusiastériou). “Under” 
(hupokato), for the blood of the sacrifices was poured at the 
bottom of the altar (Lev. 4:7). The altar of sacrifice (Ex. 
393393 40: 29), not of incense. The imagery, as in Hebrews, 
is from the tabernacle. For the word see Matt. 5:23f., often 
Me Rew 5 (8.sg39 5.00213 p 10 04218) 0627). or Thiscaltariin 
heaven is symbolic, of course, ‘the antitype for the tabernacle 
altar (Heb. 8:5). The Lamb was slain (5:6, 9, 12) and these 
martyrs have followed the example of their Lord. The souls 
(tas psuchas). The lives, for the life is in the blood (Lev. 
17:11), were given for Christ (Phil. 2:17; II Tim. 4:6). Of 
the slain (ton esphagmenon). See 5:6. Christians were slain 
during the Neronian persecution and now again under Do- 
mitian. A long line of martyrs has followed. For the word 
of God (dia ton logon tou theou). As in 1:9, the confession of 
loyalty to Christ as opposed to emperor-worship. nd for 
the testimony which they held (kai dia ten marturian hen 
eichon). See also 1:9. Probably kai equals “even” here, 
explaining the preceding. The imperfect tense eichon suits 
the repetition of the witness to Christ and the consequent 
death. 

10. How long (heds pote). “Until when.” Cf. Matt. 7:17; 
John 10:24. O Master (ho despotés). Nominative articular 


344 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


form, but used as vocative (despota) as in 4:11 (John 20:28). 
On despotes (correlative of doulos) see Luke 2:29. Here 
(alone in the Apocalypse) it is applied to God as in Luke 
2:29; Acts 4:24, but to Christ in Jude 4; II Pet. 2:1. The 
holy and true (ho hagios kai aléthinos). See 3:7 for these 
attributes of God. Avenge our blood on them that dwell upon 
the earth (ekdtkeis to haima hémon ek ton katotkounton epi tés 
gés). This same idiom in 19:2 and see it also in Luke 18 :7f., 
“a passage which goes far to answer many questions in the- 
odicy”’ (Swete). We find ekdiked, late compound, used with 
ek as here in Deut. 18:19; I Sam. 24:13, but with apo in 
Luke 18:3. For epi és gés (upon the earth) see 3:10. 

11. 4 white robe (stolé leuké). Old word from stellé, to 
equip, an equipment in clothes, a flowing robe (Mark 12:38). 
For the white robe for martyrs see 3:4f.; 4:43 7:9, 133 19:14. 
That they should rest (hina anapausontai). Sub-final clause 
with Aina and the future indicative (as in 3:9; 6:4) middle 
rather than the aorist middle subjunctive anapausontai of 
Aleph C. Yet for a little time (eti chronon mikron). Accusa- 
tive of extension of time as in 20:3. Perhaps rest from their 
cry for vengeance and also rest in peace (14:13). For the 
verb anapaud see on Matt. 11:28. Until should be fulfilled 
(heos plérothosin). Future indefinite temporal clause with 
heos and the first aorist passive subjunctive of p/érod, to fill 
full (Matt. 23:32; Col. 2:10), “until be filled full’? (the number 
of), regular Greek idiom. Which should be killed (hoi mel- - 
lontes apoktennesthai). Regular construction of articular 
present active participle of me//o (about to be, going to be) 
with the present passive infinitive of apoktennd, AKolic and 
late form for apokteind, to kill (also in Mark 12:5). John 
foresees more persecution coming (2:103 3:10). 

12. There was a great earthquake (seismos megas egeneto). 
“There came a great earthquake.” Jesus spoke of earth- 
quakes in his great eschatological discourse (Mark 13:8). 
In Matt. 24:29 the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 345 


Seismos is from seid, to shake, and occurs also in Rev. 8:5; 
11:13, 19; 16:18. The reference is not a local earthquake 
like those so common in Asia Minor. 4s sackcloth of hair 
(hos sakkos trichinos). Sakkos (Attic sakos), Latin saccus, 
English sack, originally a bag for holding things (Gen. 
42:25, 35), then coarse garment of hair (trichinos, old word 
from thrix, here only in N.T.) clinging to one like a sack, of 
mourners, suppliants, prophets leading austere lives (Matt. 
3:43 11:21; Luke 10:13). Here the hair is that of the black 
Boats (Iss) corg)iae Chaoeht2:10;! ozek.) 327h.godsy 13810; 
Mark 13:24f. See Eccl. 12:2 for eclipses treated as symbols 
of old age. Apocalyptic pictures all have celestial phe- 
nomena following earthquakes. 4s blood (hos haima). In 
Acts 2:20 we find Peter interpreting the apocalyptic eschato- 
logical language of Joel 2:31 about the sun being turned into 
darkness and the moon into blood as pointing to the events 
of the day of Pentecost as also ‘‘the great day of the Lord.” 
Peter’s interpretation of Joel should make us cautious about 
too literal an exegesis of these grand symbols. 

13. Her unripe figs (tous olunthous autés). An old word 
(Latin grossi) for figs that grow in winter and fall off in the 
spring without getting ripe (Song of Solomon 2:11f.), here 
only in N.T. Jesus used the fig tree (Mark 13:28) as a sign 
of the “end of the world’s long winter” (Swete). Cf. Is. 
34:4; Nah. 3:12. When she is shaken of a great wind (hupo 
anemou megalou seiomené). Present passive participle of 
seid, “being shaken by a great wind.” See Matt. 11:7 for 
the reed so shaken. 

14. Was removed (apechoristhé). First aorist passive in- 
dicative of apochorizd, to separate, to part (Acts 15:39). 
“The heaven was parted.” 4s a scroll when it is rolled up 
(hos biblion helissomenon). Present passive participle of 
helisso, old verb, to roll up, in N.T. only here (from Is. 34:4) 
and Heb. 1:12 (from Ps. 102:27). Vivid picture of the 
expanse of the sky rolled up and away as a papyrus roll 


346 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(Luke 4:17). Were moved (ekinéthésan). First aorist pas- 
sive indicative of kined, to move. Out of their places (ek ton 
topin auton). See also 16:20 for these violent displacements 
in the earth’s crust. Cf. Nah. 1:5 and Jer. 4:24. Jesus 
spoke of faith removing mountains (of difficulty) as in Mark 
prey (cfs Coreg). 

15. The princes (hoi megistanes). Late word from the 
superlative megistos, in LXX, Josephus, papyri, in N.T. only 
in Mark 6:21; Rev. 6:15; 18:23, for the grandees, the perse- 
cuting proconsuls (Swete). The chief captains (hoi chili- 
archoi). ‘The commanders of thousands, the military trib- 
unes (Mark 6:21; 19:18). The rich (hoi plousiot). Not 
merely those in civil and military authority will be terror- 
stricken, but the self-satisfied and complacent rich (James 
5:4f.). The strong (hoi ischuroi). Who usually scoff at fear. 
See the list in 13:16 and 19:18. Cf. Luke 21:26. Every 
bondman (pas doulos) and freeman (kai eleutheros). The two 
extremes of society. Hid themselves in the caves and in the 
rocks of the mountains (ekrupsan heautous eis ta spélaia kai eis 
tas petras ton oredn). Based on Is. 2:10, 18f. First aorist 
active indicative of krupto with the reflexive pronoun. For 
the old word spélaion see Matt. 21:13; Heb. 11:38. Oredn 
is the uncontracted Ionic form (for ordn) of the genitive 
plural of oros (mountain). 

16. They say (legousin). Vivid dramatic present active 
indicative, asisnatural here. Fallon us (Pesate eph’ hemas). - 
Second aorist (first aorist ending) imperative of piptd, tense 
of urgency, do it now. And hide us (kai krupsate hemas). 
Same tense of urgency again from krup/o (verb in verse 15). 
Both imperatives come in inverted order from Hos. 10:8 
with kalupsate (cover) in place of krupsate (hide), quoted by 
Jesus on the way to the Cross (Luke 23:30) in the order here, 
but with kalupsate, not krupsate. From the face of him that 
(apo prosdpou tou, etc.). ‘“What sinners dread most is not 


death, but the revealed Presence of God” (Swete). Cf. Gen. 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 347 


3:8. And from the wrath of the Lamb (kai apo tes orgés tou 
arniou). Repetition of “the grave irony” (Swete) of 5:5f. 
The Lamb is the Lion again in the terribleness of his wrath. 
Recall the mourning in 1:7. See Matt. 25:41ff. where Jesus 
pronounces the woes on the wicked. 

17. The great day (hé .hémera hé megalé). The phrase 
occurs in the O.T. prophets (Joel 2:11, 31; Zeph. 1:14. Cf. 
Jude 6) and is here combined with “of their wrath”? (¢és 
orgés auton) as in Zeph. 1:15, 18; 2:3; Rom. 2:5. “Their” 
(auton) means the wrath of God and of the Lamb put here 
on an equality as in 1:17f., 22:3, 13; as in I Thess. 3:11; 
II Thess. 2:16. Beckwith holds that this language about 
the great day having come “is the mistaken cry of men in 
terror caused by the portents which are bursting upon them.” 
There is something, to be sure, to be said for this view which 
denies that John commits himself to the position that this 
is the end of the ages. And who is able to stand? (kai tis 
dunatat stathenai?). Very much like the words in Nah. 1:6 
and Mal. 3:2. First aorist passive infinitive of Aist@mi. It 
is a rhetorical question, apparently by the frightened crowds 
of verse 15. Swete observes that the only possible answer 
to that cry is the command of Jesus in Luke 21:36: “Keep 
awake on every occasion, praying that ye may get strength 
to stand (stathénai, the very form) before the Son of Man.” 


CHAPTER VII 


1. “After this (meta touto). Instead of the seventh seal (8:1) 
being opened, two other episodes or preliminary visions 
occupy chapter 7 (the sealing of the servants of God 7:1-8 
and the vision of the redeemed before the throne 7:9-17). 
Standing (hestotas). Second perfect predicate participle of 
histémi, intransitive and followed by epi and the accusative 
case gontas as already in 3:20 (epi thurian) and often again 
(8:3 some MSS., others genitive; 11:11; 12:18; 14:1; 15:2), 
but note epi with genitive ¢halassés in the next clause, like 
epi kephalés in 12:1 and in 7:3. Corners (gonias). Old word 
for angle (Matt. 6:5), also in 20:8. Holding (kratountas). 
Present active participle of krated, to hold fast (Mark 7:3; 
John 20:23). The four winds (cf. Matt. 24:31) are held 
prisoner by angels at each of the four corners. Some Jews 
held the winds from due north, south, east, west to be favour- 
able, while those from the angles (see Acts 27:14) were un- 
favourable (Charles). There is an angel of the fire (14:18) 
and an angel of the waters (16:5). That no wind should blow 
(hina mé pneéi anemos). Negative purpose clause with hina 
mé and the present active subjunctive, “lest a wind keep on 
blowing.” Upon any tree (epi pan dendron). Accusative 
case here with epi rather than the preceding genitives (gés, 
thalassés), ““upon the land or upon the sea,” but “against 
any tree” (picture of attack on the tree like a tornado’s 
path). 

2. Ascend (anabainonta). Present active participle of 
anabaino, “ascending,” “‘going up,” picturing the process. 
From the sun-rising (apo anatolés héliou). Same phrase in 
16:12. From the east, though why is not told. Swete sug- 
gests it is because Palestine is east of Patmos. The plural 

348 : 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 349 


apo anatolon occurs in Matt. 2:1 without Aé/iou (sun). The 
seal of the living God (sphragida theou xontos). Here the 
signet ring, like that used by an Oriental monarch, to give 
validity to the official documents. The use of zdntos with 
theou accents the eternal life of God (1:18; 10:6; 15:7) as 
opposed to the ephemeral pagan gods. To whom it was given 
(hots edothé autois). For edothé see on 6:2, 4, etc. The repe- 
tition of autois in addition to hois (both dative) is a redun- 
dant Hebraism (in vernacular Koiné to some extent) often 
in the Apocalypse (3:8). The angels are here identified with 
the winds as the angels of the churches with the churches 
(1:20). To hurt (adikésai). First aorist active infinitive of 
adikeo, subject of edothé, common use of adiked in this sense 
of to hurt in the Apocalypse (2:11; 6:6 already), in Luke 
10:19 also. The injury is to come by letting loose the winds, 
not by withholding them. 

3. Hurt not (mé adikéséte). Prohibition with mé and the 
ingressive aorist active subjunctive of adiked, not to begin to 
hurt. Till we shall have sealed (achri sphragisomen). Tem- 
poral clause of indefinite action for the future with achri 
(sometimes achris hou or achris hou an) and the aorist sub- 
junctive as in 15:8; 20:3, 5 or the future indicative (17:7), 
usually with the notion of ascent (up to) rather than extent 
like mechri. An (modal) sometimes occurs, but it is not 
necessary. But there is no futurum exactum idea in the 
aorist subjunctive, simply “till we seal,” not ‘‘till we shall 
have sealed.” Upon their foreheads (epi tin metopon). From 
Ezek. 9:4. Old word (meta, Gps, after the eye, above the 
eye, the space above or between the eyes), in N.T. only in 
the Apocalypse (7:3; 9:43 13:16; 14:1, 93 17:5; 20:4; 22:4). 
For “the servants of God” (tous doulous tou theou) who are 
to be thus marked linked with angels in the service of God 
seewRevent 113722805 (1gity §9122:95 6. 

4. The number of the sealed (ton arithmon ton esphragis- 
menon). Accusative case object of ékousa and genitive of 


350 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


the perfect passive articular participle of sphragizo. He did 
not see the sealing or count them himself, but only heard. 
A hundred and forty and four thousand (hekaton tesserakonta 
tessares chiliades). Symbolical, of course, and not meant 
to be a complete number of the sealed (or saved) even in 
that generation, let alone for all time. The number con- 
notes perfection (Alford), 12X12 X100o=a hundred and 
forty-four thousands (chiliades, 5:11). Nominative abso- 
lute, not agreeing in case either with arithmon (accusative) 
or esphragismenon (genitive). So as to the case of esphra- 
gismenot. Out of every tribe of the children of Israel (ek pasés 
phules huion Israel). ‘There are two opposite views here, 
one taking the sealed as referring only to Jews (either actual 
Jews as a remnant or just Jewish Christians), the other 
including Gentiles as well as Jewish Christians, that is the 
true Israel as in 2:9; 3:9ff. and like Paul in Galatians and 
Romans. This is the more probable view and it takes the 
twelve tribes in a spiritual sense. But in either view there 
remains the difficulty about names of the tribes. The list is 
not geographical, since Levi is included, but Dan is omitted 
and Manasseh put in his place, though he as the son of 
Joseph is included in Joseph. Irenzeus suggested that Anti- 
christ was expected to come from the tribe of Dan and hence 
the omission here. There are various lists of the tribes in 
the O.T. (Gen. 35:22f.; 46:8ff., 49; Ex. 1:1ff.; Num. 1:2; 
13:4ff.; 26:34; Deut. 27:11f.; 33:6ff.; Josh. 13-22; Judges 5; © 
I Chron. 2-8; 12:24ff.; 27:16ff.; Ezek. 48) and given in 
various orders. In I Chron. 7:12 both Dan and Zebulon 
areomitted. Joseph is given herein placeof Ephraim. The 
distribution is equal (12,000) to each tribe. 

9. Which no man could number (hon arithmésai auton 
oudeis edunato). Redundant repetition of the pronoun auton 
after the relative hon as in 7:5 and 3:8. Edunato imperfect 
indicative and arithmésai first aorist active infinitive of 
arithmed, old verb, in N.T. only here, Matt. 10:30; Luke 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 351 


12:7. See §:9 (also 11:9; 13:73; 14:10; 17:15) for the list of 
words after ek (the spiritual Israel carried on all over the 
world), “a polyglott cosmopolitan crowd” (Swete). Stand- 
ing (hestotes). Same form in 7:1, only nominative masculine 
plural referring to ochlos (masculine singular), construction 
according to sense like the plural /egonton with ochlou in 
19:1. Arrayed (peribeblémenous). Perfect passive partici- 
ple of peridallo, but in the accusative plural (not nominative 
like hestdtes), a common variation in this book when pre- 
ceded by eidon and idou as in 4:4 (thronoi, presbuterous). 
Charles regards this as a mere slip which would have been 
changed to peribeblemenoi if John had read the MS. over. 
In white robes (stolas leukas). Predicate accusative retained 
with this passive verb of clothing as in 7:13; 10:1; 11:3; 12:1; 
17:4; 18:16; 19:13. Palms (phoinikes). Nominative again, 
back to construction with idou, not eidon. Old word, in 
N.T. only here for palm branches and John 12:13 for palm 
trees. Both these and the white robes are signs of victory 
and joy. 

10. They cry (krazousi). Vivid dramatic present. With 
a great voice (phonéi megaléi). As in 6:10; 7:2. “The poly- 
glott multitude shouts its praises as with one voice” (Swete). 
Salvation (hé soteria). Asin 12:10;19:1. Nominative abso- 
lute. Salvation here is regarded as an accomplished act on 
the part of those coming out of the great tribulation (verse 
14) and the praise for it is given to God (#02 thedi, dative 
case) and to the Lamb (di arnidi, dative also). Both God 
and Christ are thus called sdtér as in the Pastoral Epistles, as 
to God (I Tim. 1:1; 2:3; Titus 1:3; 3:4) and to Christ 
(Titus 1:4; 2:13; 3:6). For hé sdtéria see John 4:22; Acts 
4:12; Jude 3. 

11. Were standing (histekeisan). Past perfect active of 
histémi intransitive and used like an imperfect as in John 
19:26. Round about (kuklot). Preposition (in a circle) with 
genitive as in 4:6; 5:11. The angels here rejoice in the sal- 


352 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


vation of men (Luke 15:7, 10; 1 Pet. 1:12). Upon their faces 
(epi ta prosdpa auton). In reverential worship of God as in 
11:16. For this worship (fell and worshipped) see also 
4:10; $:14; 11:16; 19:4, 10; 22:8. The dative 407 theoi (God) 
with proskuned (to worship) is the usual construction for 
that meaning. When it means merely to do homage the 
accusative case is usual in this book (Charles). But in the 
Fourth Gospel the reverse order is true as to the cases with 
proskuneo (Abbott, Foh. Vocab. pp. 138-142). 

12. Note amén at the beginning and the close of the 
doxology. Note also separate feminine article with each of 
the seven attributes given God, as in 4:11; 5:12, 13. 

13. Answered (apekrithé). First aorist passive (depo- 
nent) of apokrinomai with legon (saying), a common (only 
here in the Apocalypse) Hebrew redundancy in the Gospels 
(Mark 9:5). An elder intervenes, though no question has 
been asked to interpret the vision (Swete). These (houtoi). 
Prophetic predicate nominative put before tines eisin (who 
are they). Note article repeated with stolas pointing to 
verse g, and accusative also retained after peribeblémenoi as 
there. Both “who” and “whence” as in Josh. 9:8. 

14. I say (eireka). Perfect active indicative of eipon, “I 
have said.” ‘‘To the Seer’s mind the whole scene was still 
fresh and vivid” (Swete) like kekragen in John 1:15 and 
eiléphen in Rev. §:7, not the so-called “aoristic perfect” 
which even Moulton (Pro/. p. 145) is disposed to admit. ~ 
My lord (Kurie mou). “An address of reverence to a heav- 
enly being” (Vincent), not an act of worship on John’s 
part. Thou knowest (su oidas). ‘‘At once a confession of 
ignorance, and an appeal for information” (Swete), not of 
full confidence like su oidas in John 21:15ff. They which 
come out of the great tribulation (hoi erchomenoi ek tes thlipseos 
tes megalés). Present middle participle with the idea of 
continued repetition. ‘“‘The martyrs are still arriving from 
the scene of the great tribulation” (Charles). Apparently 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 353 


some great crisis is contemplated (Matt. 13:toff.; 24:21; 
Mark 13:10), though the whole series may be in mind and 
so may anticipate final judgment. dnd they washed (kai 
eplunan). First aorist active indicative of plund, old verb, 
to wash, in N.T. only Luke 5:2; Rev. 7:14; 22:14. This 
change of construction after hoi erchomenoi from hoi plun- 
ésantes to kai eplunan is common in the Apocalypse, one of 
Charles’s Hebraisms, like kai epoiésen in 1:6 and kai planai 
in 2:20. Made them white (eleukanan). First aorist active 
indicative of /eukaind, to whiten, old verb from Jeukos 
(verse 13), in N.T. only here and Mark 9:3. “Milligan 
remarks that rodes are the expression of character, and com-- 
pares the word Aadit used of dress” (Vincent). The lan- 
guage here comes partly from Gen. 49:11 and partly from 
Ex. 19:10, 14. For the cleansing power of Christ’s blood 
seetalsonhoniiegsegsisngsColinr 20: kph une7; lo Peteias23 
Hebott4mand In Johns tz; Reveotss3g29p 02:14. fol the 
aorists look back to the life on earth when the cleansing 
was effected”’ (Swete). See Phil. 2:12f. for both divine and 
human aspects of salvation. In the blood of the Lamb (en 
toi haimati tou arniou). There is power alone in the blood 
of Christ to cleanse from sin {I John 1:7), not in the blood 
of the martyrs themselves. The result is “white,” not 
“red,” as one might imagine. 

15. Therefore (dia touto). Because of the washing de- 
scribed in verse 14. They serve him (latreuousin autot). 
Dative case with /atreud (present active indicative, old verb, 
originally to serve for hire /atron, then service in general, 
then religious service to God, Matt. 4:10, then in particular 
ritual worship of the priests, Heb. 8:5). All the redeemed. 
are priests (Rev. 16:5, 10) in the heavenly temple (6:9) as 
here. But this service is that of spiritual worship, not of 
external rites (Rom. 12:1; Phil. 3:3). Day and night (hém- 
eras kai nuktos). Genitive of time, “by day and night,” 
as in 4:8 of the praise of the four living creatures. Shall 


354 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


spread his tabernacle over them (skénosei ep’ autous). Future 
«change of tense from present in /atreuousin) active of 
skénoo, old verb from skénos (tent, tabernacle), used in 
John 1:14 of the earthly life of Christ, elsewhere in N.T. 
only in Rev. (7:14; 12:12; 13:6; 21:3). In 12:12 and 13:6 
of those who dwell in tents, here of God spreading his tent 
“over” (ep’ autous) the redeemed in heaven, in 21:3 of 
God tabernacling “with” (me? auton) the redeemed, in both 
instances a picture of sacred fellowship, and “the further 
idea of God’s Presence as a protection from all fear of evil”’ 
(Swete) like the overshadowing of Israel by the Shekinah 
and a possible allusion also to the tents (skéai) of the feast 
of tabernacles and to the tent of meeting where God met 
Moses (Ex. 33:7-11). 

16. They shall hunger no more (ou peinasousin eti). Fu- 
ture tense of peinad, old verb with late form instead of 
peinésousin like Luke 6:25. It is a free translation of Is. 
49:10 (not quotation from the LXX). Neither thirst any 
more (oude dipsésousin eti). Future tense of dipsad, the 
ewo strong human appetites will be gone, a clear refutation 
of a gross materialistic or sensual conception of the future 
dfe. Cf. John 6:35. Neither shall strike (oude mé peséi). 
Strong double negative oude mé with second aorist active 
subjunctive of pipto, to fall. They will no longer be under 
the rays of the sun as upon earth. Nor any heat (oude pan 
kauma). Old word from kaié, to burn, painful and burning - 
heat, in N.T. only here and 16:9 (picture of the opposite 
condition). The use of the negative with pam (all) for “not 
any” is common in N.T. Cf. Ps. 121:6. 

17. In the midst (ana meson). In 5:6 we have en mesdi 
fou thronou as the position of the Lamb, and so that is ap- 
parently the sense of ana meson here as in Matt. 13:25, 
though it can mean “between,” as clearly so in I Cor. 6:5. 
Shall be their shepherd (paimanei autous). ‘Shall shepherd 
them,” future active of poimaind (from poimén, shepherd), 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 355 


in John 21:16; Acts 20:28; I Pet. 5:2; Rev. 2:27; 7:17; 
12:5; 19:15. Jesus is still the Good Shepherd of his sheep 
(John to:11, 14ff.). Cf. Ps. 23:1. Snall guide them (hode- 
gései autous). Future active of hodéged, old word (from 
hodégos, guide, Matt. 15:14), used of God’s guidance of 
Israel (Ex. 15:13), of God’s guidance of individual lives 
(Ps. 5:9), of the guidance of the Holy Spirit (John 16:13), 
of Christ’s own guidance here (cf. John 14:4; Rev. 14:4). 
Unto fountains of waters of life (epi zoes pégas hudaton). 
The language is like that in Is. 49:10 and Jer. 2:13. Note 
the order, “‘to life’s water springs” (Swete) like the Vulgate 
ad vite fontes aquarum, with emphasis on 2éés (life’s). For- 
this idea see also John 4:12, 14; 7:38f.; Rev. 21:6; 22:1, 17. 
No special emphasis on the plural here or in 8:10; 14:7; 
16:4. And God shall wipe away (kai exaleipsei ho theos). 
Repeated in 21:4 from Is. 25:8. Future active of exaleipho, 
old compound, to wipe out (ex), off, away, already in 3:5 
for erasing a name and in Acts 3:19 for removing the stain 
(guilt) of sin. Every tear (pan dakruon). Old word, with 
other form, dakru, in Luke 7:38, 44. Note repetition of ek 
with ophthalmén (out of their eyes). “Words like these of 
vv. 15-17 must sound as a divine music in the ears of the 
persecuted. God will comfort as a mother comforts” 


(Baljon). 


CHAPTER VIII 


1. And when he opened (kai hotan énoixen). Were modal 
an is used with hote (used about the opening of the preceding 
six seals), but Aotan is not here rendered more indefinite, as 
is sometimes true (Mark 3:11; Rev. 4:9), but here and pos- 
sibly (can be repetition) in Mark 11:19 it is a particular 
instance, not a general rule (Robertson, Grammar, p. 973). 
There followed a silence (egeneto sigé). Second aorist middle 
of ginomai. ‘“‘There came silence.” Dramatic effect by this 
profound stillness with no elder or angel speaking, no chorus 
of praise nor cry of adoration, no thunder from the throne 
(Swete), but a temporary cessation in the revelations. See 
10:4. About the space of half an hour (hos hémioron). Late 
and rare word (hémi, half, hora, hour), here only in N.T. 
Accusative of extent of time. 

2. Stand (hestekasin). Perfect active of hist@mi (intransi- 
tive). Another “hebdomad” so frequent in the Apocalypse. 
The article (the seven angels) seems to point to seven well- 
known angels. In Enoch 20:7 the names of seven archangels 
are given (Uriel, Raphael, Raguel, Michael, Sariel, Gabriel, 
Remiel) and “angels of the Presence”’ is an idea like that 
in Is. 63:9. We do not know precisely what is John’s idea - 
here. Seven trumpets (hepta salpigges). We see trumpets 
assigned to angels in Matt. 24:31; I Thess. 4:16; I Cor. 
15:52; Rev. 4:1, 4. See also the use of trumpets in Josh. 
6:13; Joel 2:1. These seven trumpets are soon to break the 
half-hour of silence. Thus the seven trumpets grow out of 
the opening of the seventh seal, however that fact is to be 
interpreted. . 

3. Another angel (allos aggelos). Not one of the seven of 
verse 2 and before they began to sound the trumpets. This

preliminary incident of the offering of incense on the altar 
covers verses 3 to 6. Stood (estathé). Ingressive first aorist 
passive of Aistémi (intransitive), “took his place.” Over the 
altar (epi tou thusiastériou). See 6:9 for the word for the 
burnt-offering, here apparently the altar of incense (clearly 
so in Luke 1:11; possibly also Rev. 9:13), but it is not clear 
that in apocalyptic the distinction between the two altars 
of the tabernacle and temple is preserved. Aleph C Q have 
the genitive, while A P have the accusative epi to thusiasté- 
rion. A golden censer (libaniton chrusoun). Old word for 
frankincense (from /ibanos, Matt. 2:11; Rev. 18:13), but here 
alone in N.T. and for censer, as is plain by the use of chrusoun - 
(golden) with it. Cf. I Kings 7:50. Much incense (thumt- 
amata polla). See 5:8 for thumiama (the aromatic substance 
burnt, also in 18:13), but here for the live coals on which 
the incense falls. That he should add (hina dosei). Sub-final 
clause (subject of edothé, was given, singular because ¢humt- 
amata neuter plural) with hina and the future active indica- 
tive of didémi, to give, instead of ddi, the second aorist 
subjunctive. Unto the prayers (tais proseuchais). Dative 
case. In 5:18 the thumiamata are the prayers. Upon the 
golden altar (epi to thusiastérion to chrusoun to). Accusative 
case here, not genitive as above, and apparently the altar 
of incense as indicated by the word golden (Ex. 30:1ff.; Lev. 
4:17). Note triple article here fo (once before the substan- 
tive, once before the adjective, once before the adjunct “the 
one before the throne”). 

4. The smoke (ho kapnos). Old word, in N.T. only Acts 
2:19 and Rev. 8:4; 9:2f., 17f.; 14:11; 15:8; 18:9, 18; 19:3. 
Here from the incense in the angel’s hand. With the prayers 
(tais proseuchais). So associative-instrumental case, but it 
may be dative as in verse 3 (for). 

s. Taketh (ciléphen). Vivid dramatic perfect active in- 
dicative of Jambani as in §:7, “has taken.” The angel had 
apparently laid aside the censer. Hardly merely the pleo-

nastic use of /ambano (John 19:23). John pictures the scene 
for us. Filled (egemisen). He drops back to the narrative 
use of the first aorist active indicative of gemizo. With the 
Jire (ek tou puros), live coals from the altar (cf. Is. 6:6). 
Cast (ebalen). Second aorist active indicative of dal/d. See 
Gen. 19:24 (Sodom); Ezek. 10:2 and Christ’s bold metaphor 
in Luke 12:49. See this use of da//é also in Rev. 8:7; 12:4, 
9, 13; 14:19. Followed (egenonto). Came to pass naturally 
after the casting of fire on the earth. Same three elements 
in 4:5, but in different order (lightnings, voices, thunders), 
lightning naturally preceding thunder as some MSS. have 
it here. Perhaps phdnai, the voices of the storm (wind, etc.). 

6. Prepared themselves (hétoimasan hautous). First aorist 
active indicative of hetoimazod. They knew the signal and 
got ready. To sound (hina salpisosin). Sub-final (object) 
clause with hina and the first aorist ingressive active sub- 
junctive of sa/pizd. The infinitive could have been used. 

7. Sounded (esalpisen). First aorist active indicative of 
salpizo, repeated with each angel in turn (8:8, 10, 12; 9:1, 
13; 11:15). Hail and fire mingled with blood (chalaza kai pur 
memigmena en haimati). Like the plague of hail and fire in 
Ex. 9:24. The first four trumpets are very much like the 
plagues in Egypt, this one like a semitropical thunderstorm 
(Swete) with blood like the first plague (Ex. 7:17ff.; Ps. 
106:35). The old feminine word chalaza (hail) is from the . 
verb chalad, to let down (Mark 2:4), in N.T. only in Rey. 
8:7; 11:19; 16:21. The perfect passive participle memigmena 
(from mignumi, to mix) is neuter plural because of pur (fire). 
Were cast (eblethé). First aorist passive singular because 
chalaza and pur treated as neuter plural. “The storm flung 
itself on the earth” (Swete). Was burnt up (katekaé@). Sec- 
ond aorist (effective) passive indicative of katakaid, old verb 
to burn down (effective use of kata, up, we say). Repeated 
here three times for dramatic effect. See 7:1-3 about the 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 359 


trees and 9:4 where the locusts are forbidden to injure the 
grass. 

8. As it were (hos). “As if,” not a great mountain, but 
a blazing mass as large as a mountain. Burning with fire 
(puri kaiomenon). Present middle participle of kaid. Some- 
what like Enoch 18:13, but perhaps with the picture of a 
great volcanic eruption like that of Vesuvius in A.D. 79. 
Strabo tells of an eruption B.c. 196 which made a new island 
(Palea Kaumene). Became blood (egeneto haima). Like the 
Nile in the first plague (Ex. 7:20ff.). Cf. also 16:3. 

g. Of the creatures (ton ktismaton). See 5:13 for this word 
ktisma. Even they that had life (ta echonta psuchas). Here 
the nominative articular participle is in apposition with the 
genitive ktismaton, as often in this book. See Ex. 7:20 for 
the destruction of fish, and Zeph. 1:3. Was destroyed 
(diephtharésan). Second aorist passive indicative of dia- 
phtheird, old compound, to corrupt, to consume, to destroy 
(perfective use of dia), also 11:18. The plural ploion just 
before the verb makes the idea plural. 

10. Burning as a torch (kaiomenos his lampas). See 4:5 
and Matt. 2:2, perhaps a meteor, striking at the fresh-water 
supply (rivers potamén, springs pégas) as in the first Egyp- 
tian plague also. 

11. Wormwood (ho Apsinthos). Absinthe. Usually fem- 
inine (42), but masculine here probably because aséér 1s 
masculine. Only here in N.T. and not in LXX (pikria, 
bitterness, cholé, gall, etc.) except by Aquila in Prov. 5:4; 
Jer. 9:15: 23:15. There are several varieties of the plant 
in Palestine. Became wormwood (egeneto eis apsinthon). 
This use of eis in the predicate with ginomai is common in 
the LXX and the N.T. (16:19; John 16:20; Acts 5:36). Of 
the waters (ek ton hudaton). As a result of (ek) the use of 
the poisoned waters. Were made bitter (epikranthésan). 
First aorist passive indicative of pikraind. Old verb (from 


360 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


pikros, bitter), as in to:gf. In a metaphorical sense to 
embitter in Col. 3:19. 

12. Was smitten (eplége). Second aorist passive indica- 
tive of pléssd, old verb (like plégé@ plague), here only in 
N.T. That should be darkened (hina skotisthéi). Purpose 
clause with Aina and the first aorist passive subjunctive of 
Skotizd, from skotos (darkness) as in Matt. 24:29, but skotod 
in Rev. 9:2. And the day should not shine (kai hé hémera 
mé phanéi). Negative purpose clause with hina mé and the 
first aorist active subjunctive of phaind, to shed light upon, 
as in 18:23, not the second aorist passive subjunctive phanéi 
with different accent. The eclipse here is only partial and 
is kin to the ninth Egyptian plague (Ex. 10:21). 

13. An eagle (henos aetou). ‘One eagle,” perhaps henos 
(heis) used as an indefinite article (9:13; 18:21; 19:17). See 
4:7 also for the flying eagle, the strongest of birds, some- 
times a symbol of vengeance (Deut. 28:49; Hos. 8:1; Hab. 
1:8). Flying in mid-heaven (petomenou en mesouranémati). 
Like the angel in 14:6 and the birds in 19:17. Mesouranéma 
(from mesouraned to be in mid-heaven) is a late word 
(Plutarch, papyri) for the sun at noon, in N.T. only these 
three examples. This eagle is flying where all can see, and 
crying so that all can hear. Woe, woe, woe (ouai, ouai, ouai). 
Triple because three trumpets yet to come. In 18:10, 16, 
19 the double ouai is merely for emphasis. For them that 
dwell on the earth (tous katoikountas). Accusative of the ~ 
articular present active participle of katoiked, is unusual 
(Aleph Q here and also in 12:12) as in Matt. 11:21. There 
Is even a nominative in 18:10. By reason of the other voices 
(ck ton loipon phonon). “As a result of (ek) the rest of the 
voices.” There is more and worse to come, “of the three 
angels who are yet to sound” (ton tridn aggelon tin mellonton 
salpizein). 


CHAPTER IX 


1. Fallen (peptokota). Perfect active participle of pipso, 
already down. In Luke 10:18 note pesonta (constative 
aorist active, like a flash of lightning) after ethedroun and 
in Rev. 7:2 note anabainonta (present active and linear, 
coming up, picturing the process) after eidon. Of the pit 
of the abyss (tou phreatos tés abussou). Abussos is an old 
adjective (alpha privative and duthos, depth, without depth), - 
but 2 abussos (supply chéra place), the bottomless place. 
It occurs in Rom. 10:7 for the common receptacle of the 
dead for Hades (Sheol), but in Luke 8:31 a lower depth is 
sounded (Swete), for the abode of demons, and in this sense 
it occurs in Rev. 9:1, 2, 11; 11:7; 17:8; 20:1, 3. Phrear is 
an old word for well or cistern (Luke 14:5; John 4:11f.) and 
it occurs in Rev. g:1f. for the mouth of the abyss which is 
pictured as a cistern with a narrow orifice at the entrance 
and this fifth angel holds the key to it. 

2. Opened (énoixen). First aorist active indicative of 
anoignumi. With the “key” (kleis). As the smoke of a 
great furnace (hos kapnos kaminou megalés). The plague of 
demonic locusts is here turned loose. Kaminos is old word 
for a smelting-furnace, already in 1:15. Were darkened 
(eskotothé). First aorist passive indicative of skotod, old 
causative verb from skotos, in N.T. only here, 16:10; Eph. 
4:18. By reason of (ek). “Out of,” as a result of (8:13). 

3. Locusts (akrides). Also verse 7 and already in Matt. 
3:4; Mark 1:6 (diet of the Baptist). The Israelites were 
permitted to eat them, but when the swarms came like the 
eighth Egyptian plague (Ex. 10:13ff.) they devoured every 
green thing. The smoke was worse than the fallen star 
and the locusts that came out of the smoke were worse 

361 


362 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


still, “a swarm of hellish locusts” (Swete). The scorpions 
(hoi skorpioi). Old name for a little animal somewhat like 
a lobster that lurks in stone walls in warm regions, with a 
venomous sting in its tail, in N.T. in Luke 10:19; 11:12; 
Rev. 9:3, 5, 10. The scorpion ranks with the snake as 
hostile to man. 

4. It was said (errethé). First aorist passive indicative 
of eipon. That they should not hurt (hina mé adikésousin). 
Sub-final (object clause subject of erreth2) with hina mé and 
the future active of adiked as in 3:9; 8:3. Vegetation had 
been hurt sufficiently by the hail (8:7). But only such men 
as (ei mé tous anthropous hoitines). “‘Except (elliptical use 
of ei mé, if not, unless) the men who (the very ones who).” 
For this use of hostis see 1:7; 2:24; 20:4. The seal of God 
upon their foreheads (ten sphragida tou theou epi ton metopon). 
Provided for in 7:3ff. ‘“‘As Israel in Egypt escaped the 
plagues which punished their neighbours, so the new Israel 
is exempted from the attack of the locusts of the Abyss” 
(Swete). 

5. That they should not kill them (hina mé apokteindsin 
autous). Sub-final object clause (subject of edothé) with 
hina mé and the subjunctive of apokteind either present 
(continued action) or aorist (constative, form the same), 
the usual construction with hina. The locusts are charged 
to injure men, but not to kill them. But that they should be 
tormented (all’ hina basanisthésontai). Sub-final clause again - 
with Aina, but this time with the first future passive indica- 
tive (like 3:9; 6:4; 8:3; 13:12) of dasanizd, old verb, to test 
metals (from éasanos, Matt. 4:24) by touchstone, then to 
torture like Matt. 8:29, further in Rev. 11:10; 12:2; 14:10; 
20:10. Five months (ménas pente). Accusative of extent 
of time. The actual locust is born in the spring and dies 
at the end of summer (about five months). Torment (basan- 
ismos). Late word for torture, from dasanizo, in N.T. only 
in Rev. 9:5; 14:11; 18:7, 10, 15. The wound of the scorpion 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 363 


was not usually fatal, though exceedingly painful. When it 
striketh a man (hotan paiséi anthropon). Indefinite tem- 
poral clause with hotan and the first aorist active subjunc- 
tive of paid (Matt. 26:51), old verb, to smite, “whenever 
it smites a man.” 

6. Men (hoi anthropoi). Generic use of the article (men 
as a class). Shall not find it (ou mé heurésousin auton). 
Strong double negative ou mé with the future active indica- 
tive according to Aleph Q, but heurésin (second aorist ac- 
tive subjunctive) according to A P (either construction 
regular). The idea here is found in Job 3:21 and Jer. 8:3. 
“Such a death as they desire, a death which will end their 
sufferings, is impossible; physical death is no remedy for 
the dasanismos of an evil conscience” (Swete). They shall 
desire to die (epithumésousin apothanein). Future active of 
epithumed, a climax to zétésousin (they shall seek), to desire 
vehemently. Paul in Phil. 1:23 shows a preference for death 
if his work is done, in order to be with Christ, a very differ- 
ent feeling from what we have here. Fleeth (pheuget). 
Vivid futuristic present active indicative of pheugd. Even 
death does not come to their relief. 

7. The shapes (ta homoidmata). Old word from homoiod, 
to make like (from homoios, like), likeness, in N.T. only 
here, Rom. 5:14; Phil. 2:7, ‘“‘the likenesses were like” 
(homoia). Homoidma is ‘‘midway between morphé and 
schema” (Lightfoot). Unto horses (hippois). Associative- 
instrumental case, as is the rule with homoios (1:15; 2:18; 
4:6ff.; g:10, 193 11:1; 13:2, 11), but with the accusative in 
1:13; 14:14. So also homoioi chrusdi (like gold) in this 
same verse. Prepared for war (hétoimasmenois eis polemon). 
Perfect passive participle of hetoimazd. This imagery of 
war-horses is like that in Joel 2:4f. “The likeness of a 
locust to a horse, especially to a horse equipped with armour, 
is so striking that the insect is named in German Heupferd 
(hay-horse), and in Italian cavalett a little horse” (Vincent). 


364 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


As it were crowns (hos stephanoi). Not actual crowns, but 
what looked like crowns of gold, as conquerors, as indeed 
they were (4:4; 6:2; 12:1; 14:14). These locusts of the abyss 
have another peculiar feature. 4s men’s faces (hos prosopa 
anthropon). Wuman-looking faces in these demonic locusts 
to give added terror, “suggesting the intelligence and ca- 
pacity of man” (Swete). Vincent actually sees ‘“‘a distinct 
resemblance to the human countenance in the face of the 
locust.” 

8. They had (eichan). Imperfect active, late form as in 
Mark 8:7 in place of the usual eichon. As hair of women 
(hos trichas gunaikon). That is long hair (I Cor. 11:15), 
with no reference to matters of sex at all, for anthropodn just 
before is used, not andron (men as distinct from women). 
Perhaps the antenne of the locust were unusually long. 
As the teeth of lions (his leontén). Supply hoi odontes (the 
teeth) before /eontén. See Joel 1:6. The locust is voracious. 

g. As it were breastplates of iron (hos thorakas siderous). 
The thorax was originally the breast (from the neck to the 
navel), then the breastplate, only N.T. usage (Rev. 9:9, 17; 
I Thess. 5:8; Eph. 6:14). The armour for the breastplate 
was usually of iron (siderous, Rev. 2:27), but with the locusts 
it only seemed to be so (40s). However, the scaly backs and 
flanks of the locusts do resemble coats of mail. ‘‘The 
locusts of the Abyss may be the memories of the past 
brought home at times of Divine visitation” (Swete). The . 
sound of their wings (hé phoné ton pterugon). Graphic picture 
of the onrush of the swarms of demonic locusts and the 
hopelessness of resisting them. 4s the sound of chariots, of 
many horses rushing to war (hos phoné harmaton hippon pollon 
trechonton eis polemon). Both metaphors here, the clatter 
and clangour of the chariot wheels and the prancing of the 
horses are found in Joel 2:4f. Trechonton is present active 
predicate participle of trechd, torun. Cf. II Kings 7:6; Jer. 


4733- 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 365 


10. Tails (ouras). Old word, in N.T. only in Rev. 9:10, 
19; 12:4. Like unto scorpions (homoias skorpiois). Aleph A 
wrongly have homoiois (agreeing with skorpiois instead of 
with ouras). It is a condensed idiom for “like unto the 
tails of the scorpions” as we have it in 13:11 (cf. Matt. 5:20; 
I John 2:2). Stings (kentra). Old word from kentred (to 
prick, to sting), in N.T. only here, Acts 26:14 (about Paul); 
I Cor. 15:55 (about death). It is used “of the spur of a 
cock, the quill of the porcupine, and the stings of insects” 
(Vincent). It was the goad used for oxen (Prov. 26:3; Acts 
26:14). In their tails (en tais ourais autin). ‘This locates 
“their power to hurt” (Aé exousia auton adikésai, infinitive — 
here, hina adikésousin in 9:4) in their tails. It might have 
been in other organs. 

11. As king (basilea). Predicate accusative and anar- 
throus. In Prov. 30:27 it is stated that the locust has no 
king, but this is not true of these demonic locusts. Their 
king is “the angel of the abyss (verse 1) whose orders they 
obey.” His name is (onoma autoi). “Name to him” (nomi- 
native absolute and dative, asin 6:8). In Hebrew (Ebraisti). 
Adverb'as in 16:16; John 5:2; 19:13, 17, 20; 20:16. Abaddon. 
A word almost confined to the Wisdom books (Job 26:6; 
Ps. 88:11; Prov. 15:11). It is rendered in the LXX by 
Apdleia, destruction. In the Greek tongue (en tet Hellénikéi). 
With glosséi or dialektdi understood. As usual, John gives 
both the Hebrew and the Greek. pollyon (Apolluén). 
Present active masculine singular participle of apolluo, mean- 
ing “destroying,” used here as a name and so “Destroyer,” 
with the nominative case retained though in apposition with 
the accusative onoma. ‘The personification of Abaddon 
occurs in the Talmud also. It is not clear whether by Apol- 
lyon John means Death or Satan. Bousset even finds in 
the name Apollyon an indirect allusion to Apollo, one of 
whose symbols was the locust, a doubtful point assuredly. 

12. The first woe (hé ouai hé mia). Note feminine gender 


366 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


ascribed to the interjection ouai as in 11:14, perhaps because 
thlipsis is feminine, though we really do not know. Note 
also the ordinal use of mia (one) like proté (first) as in 6:1; 
Mark 16:2. There come yet two Woes (erchetai eti duo Ouat). 
Singular number erchetai instead of erchontai, though duo 
ouai. Itis true that ouai is an interjection and indeclinable, 
but it is here used with duo and is feminine just before, and 
not neuter. 

13. 4 voice (phonén mian). For mian as indefinite article 
see 8:13. Accusative case here after ekousa, though genitive 
in 8:13, a distinction between sound and sense sometimes 
exists (Acts 9:7; 22:9), but not here as the words are clearly 
heard in both instances. From (ek). “Out of the horns.” 
Note triple use of the genitive article here as of the accusa- 
tive article with this identical phrase in 8:3 (“the altar the 
golden the one before the throne’’). 

14. One saying to the sixth angel (legonta toi hektoi). Ac- 
cusative masculine singular active participle of /egd, per- 
sonifying phonén and agreeing with it in case, though not in 
gender. This voice speaks to the sixth angel (dative case). 
Which had the trumpet (ho echon tén salpigga). Nominative 
case in apposition with agge/di (dative), the same anomalous 
phenomenon in 2:20; 3:12; 14:12. Swete treats it as a paren- 
thesis, like 4:1; 11:15. Loose (/uson). First aorist (ingres- 
Sive) active imperative of /ud, “let loose.” Another group 
of four angels (7:1) like Acts 12:4, described here ‘“‘which . 
are bound” (tous dedemenous). Perfect passive articular 
participle of ded, evidently the leaders of the demonic horse- 
men (9:1 5ff.) as the four angels let loose the demonic locusts 
(7:1ff.), both quaternions agents of God’s wrath. ft the 
great river Euphrates (epi toi potamdi toi megaloi Euphrateéi). 
A regular epithet of the Euphrates (16:12; Gen. 15:18; Deut. 
1:7). It rises in Armenia and joins the Tigris in lower 
Babylonia, a total length of nearly 1800 miles, the eastern 
boundary of the Roman Empire next to Parthia. 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 367 


15. Were loosed (eluthésan). First aorist (ingressive) pas- 
sive indicative of /ud, “‘were let loose.” Which had been 
prepared (hoi hétoimasmenoi). Perfect passive articular par- 
ticiple of hetoimazd, to make ready (hetoimos), in a state of 
readiness prepared by God (12:6; 16:12; Matt. 25:34). For 
the hour and day and month and year (eis tén horan kat 
hémeran kai ména kai eniauton). For this use of eis with 
hétoimasmenon see II Tim. 2:21. All preparation over, the 
angels are waiting for the signal to begin. That they should 
kill (hina apokteinosin). ‘The same idiom in verse § about 
the fifth trumpet, which brought torture. This one brings 
death. | 

16. Of the horsemen (tou hippikou). Old adjective hippikos 
from hippos (horse), equestrian. The neuter articular singu- 
lar to hippikon, the horse or the cavalry in contrast with fo 
pezikon (the infantry), here only in N.T. For the numbers 
here see on §:11; 7:4. 

17. And thus I saw in the vision (kai houtos eidon en tet 
horasei). Nowhere else does John allude to his own vision, 
though often in Dan. (7:2; 8:2, 153; 9:21). Having (echontas). 
Accusative masculine plural of echd, probably referring to 
the riders (tous kath@menous ep auton) rather than to the 
horses (tous hippous). Breastplates as of fire and of hyacinth 
and of brimstone (thorakas purinous kai huakinthinous kat 
theiddeis). There is no Ads (as) in the Greek, but that is 
the idea of these three adjectives which are only metaphors. 
Purinos is an old adjective (from pur, fire), here only in 
N.T. Huakinthos is also an old word (from huakinthos, 
hyacinth, then of a sapphire stone Rev. 21:20), of a red 
color bordering on black, here only in the N.T. Theiddes 
is a late word (from theion, brimstone), sulphurous, here 
only in N.T. As the heads of lions (hos kephalai leonton). 
This of the horses, war-horses as always in the Bible except 
in Is. 28:28. These horses likewise have “fire and smoke 
and brimstone”’ (¢heion, brimstone, is old word, in N.T. only 


368 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


in Rev. and Luke 17:29) proceeding (ekporeuetai, singular 
because it comes first and the subjects afterwards) out of 
their mouths. Both rider and horse are terrible. 

18. By these three plagues (apo ton tridn plégon touton). 
Our “plague” or stroke from p/éssd, as in Luke 10:30 and 
often in Rev. (9:20; 11:6; 15:1, 6, 8; 16:9; 18:4, 8; 22:18). 
It is used in Ex. 11:1ff. for the plagues in Egypt. The 
three plagues here are the fire, smoke, and brimstone which 
proceed from the mouths of the horses. Was killed (apek- 
tanthésan). First aorist passive indicative of apokteind, to 
kill, third person plural, though /o friton is neuter singular 
because a collective idea. See same form in verse 20. 

19. The power (hé exousia). As in 2:26; 6:8. This power 
of the horses is both in their mouths (because of the fire, 
smoke, brimstone) and in their tails, “for their tails are 
like unto serpents” (hai gar ourai auton homoiai ophesin). 
Associative-instrumental case ophesin after homoiai. Ophis 
is old word for snake (Matt. 7:10). Having heads (echousai 
kephalas). Feminine present active participle of echd, agree- 
ing with ourai (tails). With them (en autais). Instrumental 
use of en. Surely dreadful monsters. 

20. Repented not (ou metenoésan). First aorist active in- 
dicative of metanoed. The two-thirds of mankind still spared 
did not change their creed or their conduct. Of the works 
(ek ton ergon). For this use of ek after metanoed see 2:21; 
9:21; 16:11. By “works” (ergom) here idolatries are meant, . 
as the next verse shows. _ That they should not worship (hina 
mé proskunésousin). Negative purpose clause with hina mé 
and the future active of proskuned as in 9:5. Devils (ta 
daimonia). Both in the O.T. (Deut. 32:17; Ps. 96:5; 106:37) 
and in the N.T. (I Cor. 10:21) the worship of idols is called 
the worship of unclean spirits. Perhaps this is one explana- 
tion of the hideous faces given these images. ‘‘The idols” 
(ta eidola I John §:21, from eidos, form, appearance) repre- 
sented “demons,” whether made of gold (ta chrusa) or of 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 369 


silver (ta argura) or of brass (ta chalkd) or of stone (ta 
lithina) or of wood (ta xulina). See Dan. 5:23 for this pic- 
ture of heathen idols. The helplessness of these idols, 
“which can neither see nor hear nor walk” (ha oute blepein 
dunantai oute akouein oute peripatein), is often presented in 
the OFF. (Peshrgstofts: 1.15 :4). 

21. Of their murders (ek ton phonon auton). Heads the 
list, but “sorceries” (ek ton pharmakon) comes next. Phar- 
makon was originally enchantment, as also in Rev. 21:8, 
then drug. For pharmakia see Rev. 18:34; Gal. 5:20. The 
two other items are fornication (porneias) and thefts (klem- 
maton, old word from kleptd, here alone in N.T.), all four . 
characteristic of demonic worship and idolatry. See other 
lists of vices in Mark 7:21; Gal. 5:20; Rev. 21:8; 22:15. 
Our word “pharmacy” as applied to drugs and medicine 
has certainly come a long way out of a bad environment, 
but there is still a bad odour about “‘patent medicines.” 


CHAPTER*®X 


1. Another strong angel (allon aggelon ischuron). But the 
seventh trumpet does not sound till 11:15. This angel is 
not one of the seven or of the four, but like the other strong 
angel in 5:2 and 18:21 or the other angel in 14:6, 15. The 
sixth trumpet of 9:13 ends in 9:21. The opening of the 
seventh seal was preceded by two visions (chapter 7) and 
so here the sounding of the seventh trumpet (11:15) is pre- 
ceded by a new series of visions (10:1 to 11:14). Coming 
down out of heaven (katabainonta ek tou ouranou). Present 
active participle of katabaind picturing the process of the 
descent as in 20:1 (cf. 3:12). Arrayed with a cloud (peri- 
beblemenon nephelen). Perfect passive participle of periballo 
with accusative case retained as in 7:9, 13. Not proof that 
this angel is Christ, though Christ will come on the clouds 
(1:7) as he ascended on a cloud (Acts 1:9). God’s chariot 
is in the clouds (Ps. 104:3), but this angel is a special mes- 
senger of God’s. The rainbow (hé iris). See 4:3 for this 
word. The construction here is changed from the accusa- 
tive to the nominative. 4s the sun (hos ho hélios). The 
very metaphor applied to Christ in 1:16. 4s pillars of fire 
(hos stuloi puros). Somewhat like the metaphor of Christ: 
in 1:15, but still no proof that this angel is Christ. On 
stulos see 3:12 and Gal. 2:9. 

2. And he had (kai echon). This use of the participle 
in place of eichen (imperfect) is like that in 4:7f.; 12:25 
1g:12; 21:12, 14, a Semitic idiom (Charles), or as if kata- 
bainon (nominative) had preceded in place of katabainonta. 
A little book (biblaridion). A diminutive of diblarion (papyri), 
itself a diminutive of Jiblion (5:1) and perhaps in contrast 
with it, a rare form in Hermas and Rev. 10:2, g, 10. In 


37s 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN aan 


10:8 Tischendorf reads diblidarion, diminutive of diblidion 
(Aristophanes) instead of did/ion (Westcott and Hort). The 
contents of this little book-are found in 11:1-13. Open 
(énedigmenon). See Ezek. 2:9f. Perfect (triple reduplica- 
tion) passive participle of anoigd, in contrast to the closed 
book in 5:1. There also we have epi (upon) tén dexian (the 
right hand), for it was a large roll, but here the little open 
roll is held in the hand (em té cheiri), apparently the left 
hand (verse 5). He set (eth@ken). First aorist active indica- 
tive of tithémi. The size of the angel is colossal, for he be- 
strides both land and sea. Apparently there is no special 
point in the right foot (ton poda ton dexion) being on the - 
sea (epi tés thalassés) and the left (ton eudnumon) upon the 
land (epi tes gés). It makes a bold and graphic picture. 
As a lion roareth (hosper lein mukdatai). Only instance of 
hosper in the Apocalypse, but Ads in the same sense several 
times. Present middle indicative of mukaomai, an old 
onomatopoetic word from mu or moo (the sound which a 
cow utters), common for the lowing and bellowing of cattle, 
Latin mugire, but in Theocritus for the roaring of a lion 
as here, though in I Pet. 5:3 we have druomai. Homer uses 
mukaomai for the clangour of the shield and Aristophanes 
for thunder. It occurs here alone in the N.T. It does not 
mean that what the angel said was unintelligible, only loud. 
Bi WUOs 6 223, 3Rsby1057732,-10, etc. 

3. The seven thunders (hai hepta brontai). A recognized 
group, but not explained here, perhaps John assuming them 
to be known. For drontai see already 4:5; 6:1; 8:5. In Ps. 
29 the Lord speaks in the sevenfold voice of the thunder- 
storm upon the sea. Their voices (tas heauton phonas). 
Cognate accusative with e/alésan and heauton (reflexive) 
means “‘their own.” In John 12:28 the voice of the Father 
to Christ was thought by some to be thunder. 

4. I was about to write (émellon graphein). Imperfect ac- 


372 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


tive of mello (double augment as in John 4:47; 12:33; 18:32) 
and the present (inchoative) active infinitive of grapho, “I 
was on the point of beginning to write,” as commanded in 
I:11, 19. Seal up (sphragison). Aorist active imperative 
of sphragizd, tense of urgency, “seal up at once.” And 
write them not (kai mé auta grapséis). Prohibition with mé 
and the ingressive aorist active subjunctive of graphd, ‘Do 
not begin to write.” It is idle to conjecture what was in 
the utterances. Compare Paul’s silence in II Cor. 12:4. 

5. Standing (hestota). Second perfect active participle of 
hist@mi (intransitive). John resumes the picture in verse 2. 
Lifted up (éren). First aorist active indicative of aird, to 
lift up. To heaven (eis ton ouranon). Toward heaven, the 
customary gesture in taking a solemn oath (Gen. 14:22; 
Deut. 32:40; Dan. 12:7). 

6. Sware (Gmosen). First aorist indicative of omnud to 
swear. By him that liveth (en toi zonti). This use of en 
after omnuo instead of the usual accusative (James 5:12) is 
like the Hebrew (Matt. 5:34, 36). ‘“The living one for ages 
of ages” is a common phrase in the Apocalypse for God as 
eternally existing (1:18; 4:9, 10; 15:7). This oath proves 
that this angel is not Christ. Who created (hos ektisen). 
First aorist active indicative of ktizd, a reference to God’s 
creative activity as seen in Gen. 1:1ff.; Ex. 20:11; Is. 37:16; 
42:5; Ps. 33:6; 145:6, etc. That there shall be time no longer . 
(Aoti chronos ouketi estai). Future indicative indirect dis- 
course with oti. But’ this does not mean that chronos 
(time), Einstein’s “fourth dimension” (added to length, 
breadth, height), will cease to exist, but only that there 
will be no more delay in the fulfillment of the seventh 
trumpet (verse 7), in answer to the question, “How long?” 
(6:10). 

7. When he is about to sound (hotan melléi salpizein). In- 
definite temporal clause with hotan and the present active 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 373 


subjunctive of me//é and the present (inchoative) active in- 
finitive of sa/pizd, “whenever he is about to begin to sound” 
(in contrast to the aorist in 11:15). Then (kai). So in 
apodosis often (14:10). Js finished (etelesthé). First aorist 
passive indicative of. ¢e/ed, proleptic or futuristic use of the 
aorist as in I Cor. 7:28. So also 15:1. The mystery of God 
(to mustérion tou theou). This same phrase by Paul in I 
Cor. 2:1; Col. 2:2. Here apparently the whole purpose of 
God in human history is meant. According to the good tidings 
which he declared (hos euéggelisen). ‘“As he gospelized to,” 
first aorist active indicative of euaggelizd, a rare use of the 
active as in 14:6 with the accusative. See the middle so- 
used) iniGalisn:g7 [Petzerz122id See Amosay273\ Jerni7:253 
25:4 for this idea in the O.T. prophets who hoped for a 
cleaning up of all mysteries in the last days. 

8. Again speaking and saying (palin lalousan kai legousan). 
Present active predicate participles feminine accusative sin- 
gular agreeing with Aén (object of ékousa), not with phoné 
(nominative) as most of the cursives have it (/alousa kai 
legousa). Ordinarily it would be elalei kai elegen. See 4:1 
for like idiom. This is the voice mentioned in verse 4. No 
great distinction is to be made here between /a/ed and Jegé. 
Go, take (Hupage labe). Present active imperative of hupago 
and second aorist active imperative of Jamband. The use 
of hupage (exclamation like ide) is common in N.T. (Matt. 
5:24; 8:4; 19:21; John 4:16; 9:7). Charles calls it a He-: 
braism (16:1). Note the repeated article here (¢o) referring 
to the open book in the hand of the angel (verse 2), only 
here diblion is used, not the diminutive of Jiblaridion of 
verses 2, 9, I0. 

g. I went (apéltha). Second aorist active indicative (-a 
form), “I went away” (ap-) to the angel. John left his 
position by the door of heaven (4:1). That he should give 
(dounai). Second aorist active infinitive of didomi, indirect 


374 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


command after /egon (bidding) for dos in the direct discourse 
(second aorist active imperative second person singular). 
This use of /egd to bid occurs in 13:14; Acts 21:21. He saith 
(Jegei). Dramatic vivid present active indicative of J/egé. 
Take it and eat it up (labe kai kataphage auto). Second aorist 
(effective) active imperatives of Jambané and katesthio (per- 
fective use of kata, “‘eat down,” we say “eat up”). See the 
same metaphor in Ezek. 3:1-3; Jer. 15:6f. The book was 
already open and was not to be read aloud, but to be digested 
mentally by John. I¢ shall make thy belly bitter (pikranei 
sou ten koilian). Future active of pikraind, for which verb 
see 8:11; 10:10; and Col. 3:19. There is no reference in 
Ezekiel or Jeremiah to the bitterness here mentioned. Sweet 
as honey (gluku hos meli). Yor the sweetness of the roll see 
Ps. 19:10f.; 119:103. “‘Every revelation of God’s purposes, 
even though a mere fragment, a did/aridion, is ‘bitter-sweet,’ 
disclosing judgement as well as mercy” (Swete). Deep and 
bitter sorrows confront John as he comes to understand 
God’s will and way. 

10. [ took—and ate it up (elabon—kai katephagon auto). 
Second aorist active indicatives of the same verbs to show 
John’s prompt obedience to the command. The order of the 
results is here changed to the actual experience (sweet in the 
mouth, bitter in the belly). The simplex verb ephagon 
(I ate) is now used, not the compound katephagon (I ate up). | 

11. They say (legousin). Present active of vivid dramatic 
action and the indefinite statement in the plural as in 13:16; 
16:15. It is possible that the allusion is to the heavenly 
voice (10:4, 8) and to the angel (10:9): Thou must prophesy 
again (det se palin propheteusai). Not a new commission 
(1:19), though now renewed. Cf. Ezek. 4:7; 6:2; Jer. 1:10. 
The palin (again) points to what has preceded and also to 
what is to come in 11:15. Here it is predictive prophecy 
(prophéteusai, first aorist active infinitive of prophéteud). 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 375 


Over (epi). In the case, in regard to as in John 12:16 (with 
grapho), not in the presence of (epi with genitive, Mark 13:9) 
nor against (epi with the accusative, Luke 22:53). For 
this list of peoples see 5:9, occurring seven times in the 
Apocalypse. 


CHAPTER XI 


1. A reed (kalamos). Old word for a growing reed (Matt. 
11:7) which grew in immense brakes in the Jordan valley, a 
writer’s reed (III John 7), a measuring-rod (here, 21:15f.5 
Ezek. 40:3-6; 42:16-19). Like a rod (homoios rabdoi). See 
2:27; Mark 6:8 for rabdos. And one said (legon). “Saying” 
(present active masculine participle of /ego) is all that the 
Greek has. The participle implies edoken (he gave), not 
edothé, a harsh construction seen in Gen. 22:20; 38:24, etc. 
Rise and measure (egeire kai metréson). Present active im- 
perative of egeird (intransitive, exclamatory use as in Mark 
2:11) and first aorist active imperative of metred. In Ezek. 
42:2ff. the prophet measures the temple and that passage is 
probably in mind here. But modern scholars do not know 
how to interpret this interlude (11:1-13) before the seventh 
trumpet (11:15). Some (Wellhausen) take it to be a scrap 
from the Zealot party before the destruction of Jerusalem, 
which event Christ also foretold (Mark 13:2 =Matt. 24:2 = 
Luke 21:6) and which was also attributed to Stephen (Acts 
6:14). Charles denies any possible literal interpretation and 
takes the language in a wholly eschatological sense. There . 
are three points in the interlude, however understood: the 
chastisement of Jerusalem or Israel (verses 1 and 2), the 
mission of the two witnesses (3-12), the rescue of the rem- 
nant (13). There is a heavenly sanctuary (7:15; 11:19; 
14:15, etc.), but here aos is on earth and yet not the actual 
temple in Jerusalem (unless so interpreted). Perhaps here 
it is the spiritual (3:12; IT Thess. 2:4; I Cor. 3:16f.; II Cor. 
6:16; Eph. 2:19ff.). For altar (thusiastérion) see 8:3. Per- 
haps measuring as applied to “‘them that worship therein” 

376 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 377; 


(tous proskunountas en autodi) implies a word like numbering, 
with an allusion to the 144,000 in chapter 7 (a zeugma). 

2. The court (tén aulen). The uncovered yard outside the 
house. There were usually two, one between the door and 
the street, the outer court, the other the inner court sur- 
rounded by the buildings (Mark 14:66). This is here the 
outer court, “which is without the temple” (té7 exdthen tou 
naou), outside of the sanctuary, but within the Aieron where 
the Gentiles could go (carrying out the imagery of the 
Jerusalem temple). Leave without (ekbale exithen). Liter- 
ally, “‘cast without” (second aorist active imperative of 
ekballo. Do not measure it (mé autéen metréséis). Prohibition © 
with mé and the first aorist active (ingressive) subjunctive 
of metred. This outer court is left to its fate. In Herod’s 
temple the outer court was marked off from the inner by 
“the middle wall of partition” (to mesoitoichon tou phragmou, 
Eph. 2:15), beyond which a Gentile could not go. In this 
outer court was a house of prayer for the Gentiles (Mark 
11:17), but now John is to cast it out and leave to its fate 
(given to the Gentiles in another sense) to be profaned by 
them. They shall tread under foot (patésousin). Future 
active of pated, here to trample with contempt as in Luke 
21:24, even the holy city (Matt. 4:5; Is. 48:2; Neh. 11:1). 
Charles thinks that only the heavenly city can be so called 
here (21:2, 10; 22:19) because of 11:8 (Sodom and Gomor- 
rah). But the language may be merely symbolical. See 
Dan. 9:24. Forty and two months (ménas tesserakonta kai 
duo). Accusative of extent of time. This period in Dan. 
7:25; 12:7. It occurs in three forms in the Apocalypse 
(forty-two months, here and 13:5; 1260 days, 11:3 and 12:6; 
time, times and half a time or 34 years, 12:14 and so in 
Daniel). This period, however its length may be con- 
strued, covers the duration of the triumph of the Gentiles, 
of the prophesying of the two witnesses, of the sojourn of the 
woman in the wilderness. 


378 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


3. I will give (doéso). Future active of didimi. The 
speaker may be God (Beckwith) or Christ (Swete) as in 
2:13; 21:6 or his angel representative (22:7, 12ff.). The 
idiom that follows is Hebraic instead of either the infinitive 
after didomi as in 2:73 3:21; 6:4; 7:23 13:7, 15; 16:8 or hina 
with the subjunctive (9:5; 19:8) we have kai prophéteu- 
sousin (and they shall prophesy). Unto my two witnesses 
(tois dusin martusin mou). Dative case after doso. The 
article seems to point to two well-known characters, like 
Elijah, Elisha, but there is no possible way to determine 
who they are. All sorts of identifications have been at- 
tempted. Clothed (periblemenous). Perfect passive par- 
ticiple of periballd as often before (7:9, 13; 10:1, etc.). But 
Aleph A P Q here read the accusative plural in -ous, while 
C has the nominative in -oi. Charles suggests a mere slip 
for the nominative, but Hort suggests a primitive error in 
early MSS. for the dative peribeblemenois agreeing with 
martusin. In sackcloth (sakkous). Accusative retained with 
this passive verb as in 7:9, 13. See 6:12 for sakkos and also 
Matt. 3:4. The dress suited the message (Matt. 11:21). 

4. The two olive trees (hai duo elaiai). The article seems 
to point to what is known. For this original use of elaia 
see Rom. 11:17, 24. In Zech. 4:2, 3, 14 the lampstand or 
candlestick (/uchnia) is Israel, and the two olive trees ap- 
parently Joshua and Zerubbabel, but John makes his own 
use of this symbolism. Here the two olive trees and the © 
candlesticks are identical. Standing (hestotes). Masculine 
perfect active participle agreeing with Aoufoi instead of 
hestosai (read by P and cursives) agreeing with elaiai kai 
luchniai, even though hai (feminine plural article) be ac- 
cepted before endpion tou kuriou (before the Lord). 

5. If any man desireth to hurt them (ei tis autous thelei 
note Condition of first class, assumed to be true, with 
ei and present active indicative (¢helei) “if any one wants to 
hurt” (adikésai first aorist active infinitive). It is impos- 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 379 


sible to hurt these two witnesses till they do their work. 
The fire proceeding out of the mouths of the witnesses is 
like Elijah’s experience (II Kings 1:10). Devoureth (kates- 
thiei). “Eats up (down),” present active indicative of 
katesthio. If any man shall desire (ei tis theléséi). Condi- 
tion of third class with ei and first aorist active subjunctive 
of theld as in Luke 9:13; Phil. 3:12, but MSS. also read 
either thelei (present active indicative) or thelései (future ac- 
tive, condition of the first class like the preceding one. The 
condition is repeated in this changed form, as less likely to 
happen and with inevitable death (dei auton apoktanthénai, 
must be killed, first aorist passive infinitive of apokteind 
with dei). 

6. To shut the heaven (kleisai ton ouranon). First aorist 
active infinitive of k/eid. As Elijah did by prayer (I Kings 
17:1; Luke 4:25; James 5:17). That it rain not (hina mé 
huetos brechéi). Sub-final use of hina mé with the present 
active subjunctive of drechd, old verb to rain (Matt. 5:45), 
here with huetos as subject. During the days (tas hémeras). 
Accusative of extent of time. In Luke 4:25 and James 5:17 
the period of the drouth in Elijah’s time was three and a 
half years, just the period here. Of their prophecy (¢és 
prophéteias auton). Not here the gift of prophecy (I Cor. 
12:10) or a particular prophecy or collection of prophecies 
(Rev. 1:3; 22:7f.), but “the execution of the prophetic 
office’”’ (Swete). Over the waters (epi ton hudaton). “Upon 
the waters.” As Moses had (Ex. 7:20). Into blood (eis 
haima). As already stated in 8:8 about the third trumpet 
and now again here. To smite (pataxai). First aorist ac- 
tive infinitive of patassd, used here with exousian echousin 
(they have power), as is strephein (to turn). With every 
plague (en paséi plégei). In I Kings 4:8, but with reference 
to the plagues in Egypt. 4s often as they shall desire (hosakis 
ean thelésosin). Indefinite temporal clause with hosakis and 


380 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


modal ean (=an) and the first aorist active subjunctive of 
theld, ‘‘as often as they will.” 

7. When they shall have finished (hotan telesosin). Merely 
the first aorist active subjunctive of teled with hotan in an 
indefinite temporal clause with no futurum exactum (future 
perfect), “whenever they finish.” The beast (to thérion). 
“The wild beast comes out of the abyss” of g:1f. He re- 
appears in 13:1; 17:8. In Dan. 7:3 théria occurs. Nothing 
less than antichrist will satisfy the picture here. Some see 
the abomination of Dan. 7:7 and Matt. 24:15. Some see 
Nero redivivus. He shall make war with them (poiései met’ 
auton polemon). ‘This same phrase occurs in 12:17 about 
the dragon’s attack on the woman. It is more the picture 
of single combat (2:16). He shall overcome them (nikései 
autous). Future active of nikad. The victory of the beast 
over the two witnesses is certain, asin Dan. 7:21. And kill 
them (kai apoktenei). Future active of apokteind. Without 
attempting to apply this prophecy to specific individuals or 
times, one can agree with these words of Swete: ‘“‘But his 
words cover in effect all the martyrdoms and massacres of 
history in which brute force has seemed to triumph over 
truth and righteousness.” 

8. Their dead bodies lie (to pt0ma auton). Old word from 
pipto (to fall), a fall, especially of bodies slain in battle, a 
corpse, a carcase (Matt. 14:12), here the singular (some 
MSS. ptomata, plural) as belonging to each of the auton - 
(their) like stomatos auton (their mouth) in verse 5. So also 
in verse 9. No word in the Greek for “lie.” In (epi). 
“Upon,” as in verse 6, with genitive (¢@s plateias), the broad 
way (hodou understood), from platus (broad) as in Matt. 
6:5, old word (Rev. 21:21; 22:2). Of the great city (tés 
poleds tés megalés). Clearly Jerusalem in view of the closing 
clause (hopou—estaurothé), though not here called “the holy 
city”’ as in verse 2, and though elsewhere in the Apocalypse 
Babylon (Rome) is so described (14:8; 16:19; 17:5; 18:2, 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 381 


10, 16, 18, 19, 21). Which (hétis). “Which very city,” not 
“whichever.” Spiritually (pneumatikos). This late adverb 
from pneumatikos (spiritual)-occurs in the N.T. only twice, 
in I Cor. 2:14 (13) for the help of the Holy Spirit -in in- 
terpreting God’s message and here in a hidden or mystical 
(allegorical sense). For this use of pneumatikos see 1 Cor. 
10:3f. Judah is called Sodom in Is. 1:9f.; Ezek. TOG EE: 
See also Matt. 10:15; 11:23. Egypt is not applied to Israel 
in the O.T., but is “an obvious symbol of oppression and 
slavery” (Swete). Where also their Lord was crucified (hopou 
kai ho kurios auton estauroth@). First aorist passive indica- 
tive of staurod, to crucify, a reference to the fact of Christ’s - 
crucifixion in Jerusalem. This item is one of the sins of 
Jerusalem and the disciple is not greater than the Master 
(John 15:20). 

9. Men from among (ek ton etc.). No word for “men” 
(anthropoi or polloi) before ek ton, but it is implied (partitive 
use of ek) as in 2:10 and often. See also 5:9; 7:9 for this 
enumeration of races and nations. Do look upon (blepousin). 
Present (vivid dramatic) active indicative of blepd. Three 
days and a half (hémeras treis kai hemisu). Accusative of 
extent of time. Hémisu is neuter singular though hémeras 
(days) is feminine as in Mark 6:23; Rev. 12:14. The days 
of the gloating over the dead bodies are as many as the 
years of the prophesying by the witnesses (11:3), but there 
is no necessary correspondence (day for a year). This de- 
light of the spectators “‘is represented as at once fiendish 
and childish” (Swete). Suffer not (ouk aphiousin). Present 
active indicative of aphid, late form for aphiémi, as in 
Mark 1:34 (cf. apheis in Rev. 2:20). This use of aphiemi 
with the infinitive is here alone in the Apocalypse, though 
common elsewhere (John 11:44, 48; 12:7; 18:8). Their dead 
bodies (ta ptomata auton). “Their corpses,” plural here, 
though singular just before and in verse 8. To be laid in a 
tomb (tethénai eis mnéma). First aorist passive of stithémi, 


382 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


to place. Mnéma (old word from mimnésko, to remind) is 
a memorial, a monument, a sepulchre, a tomb (Mark 5:3). 
“Tn a country where burial regularly took place on the day 
of death the time of exposure and indignity would be re- 
garded long” (Beckwith). See Tobit 1:18ff. 

10. They that dwell upon the earth (hoi katoikountes epi 
tés gés). Present active articular participle of katoiked, “an 
Apocalyptic formula” (Swete) for the non-Christian world 
(3:10; 6:10; 8:13; 13:8, 12, 14; 17:8). Rejoice (chairousin). 
Present active indicative of chaird. Over them (ep’ autois). 
Locative (or dative) case with epi as in 10:11. Make merry 
(euphrainontai). Present middle indicative of euphraind, 
old verb (eu, phrén, jolly mind), as in Luke 15:32; Rev. 
12:12; 18:20. Jubilant jollification over the cessation of the 
activity of the two prophets. They shall send gifts to one 
another (dora pempsousin allélois). Future active of pempo 
with dative allélois. Just as we see it done in Esther 9:19, 
22; Neh. 8:10, 12. Tormented (ebasanisan). First aorist 
active indicative of basanizd, for which see 9:5. This is 
the reason (Aoti) of the fiendish glee of Jew and Gentile, 
who no longer will have to endure the prophecies (11:3f.) 
and dread miracles (11:5f.) of these two prophets. ‘“‘Such 
a sense of relief is perhaps not seldom felt today by bad 
men when a preacher of righteousness or a signal example 
of goodness is removed” (Swete). 

11. After the (meta tas etc.). The article tas (the) points ~ 
back to 11:9. The breath of life from God (pneuma xoés ek 
tou theou). ‘This phrase (pneuma xz0és) occurs in Gen. 6:17; 
7:15, 22 of the lower animals, but here there is clearly an 
allusion to Ezek. 37:5, 10 (also II Kings 13:21), where the 
dead bones lived again. Entered into them (eisélthen en 
autois). Second aorist active indicative of eiserchomai with 
en rather than eis after it (cf. Luke 9:46). The prophecy 
has here become fact (change from future pempsousin to 
aorist eisélthen). They stood upon their feet (estésau epi tous 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 383 


podas auton). Ingressive second aorist active indicative of 
histémi (intransitive). Reference to Ezek. 37:10, but with 
the accusative in place of genitive there after epi as in II 
Kings 13:21. Fell upon (epepesen epi). Second aorist ac- 
tive indicative of epipiptd with repetition of epi. The same 
prophetic use of the aorist as in eisélthen and estésan. Be- 
held (theorountas). Present active articular participle of 
theored. “The spectators were panic-stricken” (Swete). 

12. Saying (Jegousés). Present active predicate participle 
of /egd, feminine genitive agreeing with phonés, though some 
MSS. have the accusative phdnén legousan, either construc- 
tion being proper after @kousan (they heard). There is a 
little evidence for @kousa like 12:10 (24 times in the book). 
Cf. John 5:28. Come up hither (anabate hide). Second 
aorist active imperative of anabaind. The ascension of these 
two witnesses is in full view of their enemies, not just in 
the presence of a few friends as with Christ (Acts 1:9). 
They went up (anebésan). Second aorist active indicative 
of anabaino. In the cloud (en tei nepheléi). As Jesus did 
(Acts 1:9) and like Elijah (II Kings 2:11). Their triumph 
is openly celebrated before their enemies and is like the 
rapture described by Paul in I Thess. 4:17. 

13. There was (egeneto). ‘““There came to pass” (second 
aorist middle indicative of ginomai). Earthquakes are often 
given as a symbol of great upheavals in social and spiritual 
order (Swete) as in Ezek. 37:7; 38:19; Hagg. 2:6; Mark 
13:8; Heb. 12:26f.; Rev. 6:12; 16:18. Fell (epesen). Second 
aorist active indicative of pipfd, to fall. Only the tenth (¢o 
dekaton) of the city fell. Cf. to triton (the third) in 8:7-12, 
perhaps a conventional number. Were killed (apektanthésan). 
First aorist passive indicative of apokteind as in 9:18. Seven 
thousand persons (onomata anthropon chiliades hepta). ‘This 
use of onomata (names of men here) is like that in 3:4; Acts 
1:15 and occurs in the papyri (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 
196f.). Were affrighted (emphoboi egenonto). ‘Became ter- 


384 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


rified,” old adjective (en, phobos, fear) as in Luke 24:5; Acts 
10:43 24:25. “‘A general movement toward Christianity, 
induced by fear or despair—a prediction fulfilled more than 
once in ecclesiastical history” (Swete). Gave glory (edokan 
doxan). First aorist active indicative of didimi, when they 
saw the effect of the earthquake, recognition of God’s power 
(John 9:24; Acts 12:23; Rom. 4:20). 

14. Is past (apélthen). Second aorist active indicative of 
aperchomai. See 9:12 for this use and 21:1, 4. The second 
woe (hé ouai hé deutera) is the sixth trumpet (9:12) with the 
two episodes attached (10:1-11:13). The third woe (hé ouai 
hé trité, feminine as in 9:12) is the seventh trumpet, which 
now “cometh quickly” (erchetai tachu), for which phrase 
see 2:16; 3:11; 22:7, 12,20. Usually pointing to the Parousia. 

15. There followed (egenonto). “There came to pass.” 
There was silence in heaven upon the opening of the seventh 
seal (8:1), but here ‘“‘great voices.” Perhaps the great 
voices are the 20a of 4:6ff.; 5:8. Saying (legontes). Con- 
struction according to sense; /egontes, masculine participle 
(not /egousai), though phdnai, feminine. John understood 
what was said. Is become (egeneto). ‘Did become,” pro- 
phetic use of the aorist participle, already a fact. See 
egeneto in Luke 19:9. The kingdom of our Lord and of his 
Christ (tou kuriou hémon kai tou Christou autou). Repeat 
hé basileia from the preceding. God the Father is meant 
here by kuriou (Lord), as autou (his) shows. This is the . 
certain and glorious outcome of the age-long struggle against 
Satan, who wields the kingdom of the world which he offered 
to Christ on the mountain for one act of worship. But Jesus 
scorned partnership with Satan in the rule of the world, 
and chose war, war up to the hilt and to the end. Now the 
climax has come with Christ as Conqueror of the kingdom 
of this world for his Father. This is the crowning lesson 
of the Apocalypse. He shall reign (basileusei). Future ac- 
tive of basileud. God shall reign, but the rule of God and 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 385 


of Christ is one as the kingdom is one (I Cor. 15:27). Jesus 
is the Lord’s Anointed (Luke 2:26; 9:20). 

16. The four and twenty elders (hoi eikosi tessares pres- 
buteroi). They follow the living creatures (verse 15, if cor- 
rectly interpreted) in their adoration, as in 4:9ff. Though 
seated on thrones of their own (4:4), yet they fall upon their 
faces in every act of worship to God and Christ (4:10; 
5:8, 14; 19:4). Here epi ta prosdpa auton (upon their faces) 
is added as in 7:11 about the angels. The elders here again 
represent the redeemed, as the four living creatures the 
forces of nature, in the great thanksgiving here (eucharis- 
toumen, present active indicative of eucharisted). 

17. O Lord God (Kurie ho theos). Vocative form kurie and 
nominative form ho theos (vocative in use). See 1:8; 4:8 for 
this combination with ho pantokrator (the Almighty). For 
ho 6n kat ho én (which art and which wast) see 1:4, 8; 4:8; 
16:5. Thou hast taken (eiléphes). Perfect active indicative of 
lambano, emphasizing the permanence of God’s rule, “Thou 
hast assumed thy power.” Didst reign (ebasileusas). In- 
gressive first aorist active indicative of basileud, “Didst be- 
gin to reign.” See this combination of tenses (perfect and 
aorist) without confusion in 3:33 5:7; 8:5. 

18. Were wroth (orgisthésan). Ingressive first aorist ac- 
tive indicative of orgizomai, “became angry.” The culmina- 
tion of wrath against God (16:13ff.; 20:8f.). Cf. Ps. 2:1, 5, 
12; 99:1; Acts 4:25ff. John sees the hostility of the world 
against Christ. Thy wrath came (élthen hé orgé sou). Second 
aorist active indicative of erchomai, the prophetic aorist 
again. The Dies Ire is conceived as already come. The 
time of the dead to be judged (ho kairos ton nekron krithénat). 
For this use of kairos see Mark 11:13; Luke 21:24. By “the 
dead” John apparently means both good and bad (John 
5:25; Acts 24:21), coincident with the resurrection and judg- 
ment (Mark 4:29; Rev. 14:15ff.; 20:1-15). The infinitive 
krithénai is the first aorist passive of krind, epexegetic use 


386 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


with the preceding clause, as is true also of dounai (second 
aorist active infinitive of diddmi), to give. Their reward (ton 
misthon). This will come in the end of the day (Matt. 20:8), 
from God (Matt. 6:1), at the Lord’s return (Rev. 22:12), 
according to each one’s work (I Cor. 3:8). The small and 
the great (tous mikrous kai tous megalous). The accusative 
here is an anacoluthon and fails to agree in case with the 
‘preceding datives after dounai ton misthon, though some 
MSS. have the dative tois mikrois, etc. John is fond of this 
phrase “the small and the great” (13:16; 19:5, 18; 20:12). 
To destroy (diaphtheirai). First aorist active infinitive of 
diaphtheiro, carrying on the construction with kairos. Note 
tous diaphtheirontas, “those destroying” the earth (cor- 
rupting the earth). There is a double sense in diaphtheird 
that justifies this play on the word. See 19:2. In I Tim. 
6:5 we have those “corrupted in mind” (diaphtharmenoi ton 
noun). God will destroy the destroyers (I Cor. 3:16f.). 

19. Was opened (énoigé). Second aorist passive indicative 
of anoigd, with augment on the preposition as in 15:5. For 
the sanctuary (aos) of God in heaven see 3:12; 7:15; 
15:6ff.; 21:22. Was seen (Ophthé). First aorist passive in- 
dicative of horad. The ark of his covenant (hé kibotos tés 
diathékés autou). The sacred ark within the second veil of 
the tabernacle (Heb. 9:4) and in the inner chamber of Sol- 
omon’s temple (I Kings 8:6) which probably perished when 
Nebuchadrezzar burnt the temple (II Kings 25:9; Jer. 3:16). -

CHAPTER XII 


1. 4 great sign (sémeion mega). The first of the visions 
to be so described (13:3; 15:1), and it is introduced by 
ophthé as in 11:19 and 12:3, not by meta tauto or by eidon 
or by etdon kai idou as heretofore. This “sign” is really a 
teras (wonder), as it is so by association in Matt. 24:24; 
John 4:48; Acts 2:22; 5:12. The element of wonder is not 
in the word sémeion as in teras, but often in the thing itself ~ 
as in Luke 21:11; John 9:16; Rev. 13:13ff.; 1521: ¥rotig: 
19:20. 4 woman (guné). Nominative case in apposition 
with sémeion. “The first ‘sign in heaven’ is a Woman—the 
earliest appearance of a female figure in the Apocalyptic 
vision” (Swete). Arrayed with the sun (peribeblémené ton 
hélion). Perfect passive participle of periballd, with the 
accusative retained as so often (9 times) in the Apocalypse. 
Both Charles and Moffatt see mythological ideas and sources 
behind the bold imagery here that leave us all at sea. Swete 
understands the Woman to be “‘the church of the Old Testa- 
ment” as “the Mother of whom Christ came after the flesh. 
But here, as everywhere in the Book, no sharp dividing line 
is drawn between the Church of the Old Testament and the 
Christian Society.” Certainly she is not the Virgin Mary, 
as verse 17 makes clear. Beckwith takes her to be “‘the 
heavenly representative of the people of God, the ideal Zion, 
which, so far as it is embodied in concrete realities, is repre- 
sented alike by the people of the Old and the New Cove- 
nants.” John may have in mind Is. 7:14 (Matt. 1:23; 
Luke 1:31) as well as Mic. 4:10; Is. 26:17f.; 66:7 without a 
definite picture of Mary. The metaphor of childbirth is 
common enough (John 16:21; Gal. 4:19). The figure is a 
bold one with the moon “under her feet” (hupokatd tin 

387 


388 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


podoin autés) and “‘a crown of twelve stars” (stephanos 
asteron dodeka), a possible allusion to the twelve tribes 
(James 1:1; Rev. 21:12) or to the twelve apostles (Rev. 
21:14). 

2. And she was with child (kai en gastri echousa). Perhaps 
estin to be supplied or the participle used as a finite verb 
as in 10:2. This is the technical idiom for pregnancy as in 
Matt. 1:18, 23, etc. Travailing in birth (Odinousa). Present 
active participle of ddind, old verb (from odin birth-pangs 
I Thess. 5:3), in N.T. only here and Gal. 4:27. And in pain 
(kat basanizomené). “And tormented” (present passive par- 
ticiple of dasanizo, for which see already 9:5; 11:10), only 
here in N.T. in sense of childbirth. To be delivered (tekein). 
Second aorist active infinitive of tiktd, to give birth, epexe- 
getical use. Also in verse 4. 

3- Another sign (allo semeion). “A second tableau fol- 
lowing close upon the first and inseparable from it” (Swete). 
And behold (kai idou). As often (4:1; 6:2, 5, 8, etc.). 4 
great red dragon (drakon megas purros). Homer uses this 
old word (probably from derkomai, to see clearly) for a great 
monster with three heads coiled like a serpent that ate 
poisonous herbs. The word occurs also in Hesiod, Pindar, 
#Eschylus. The Babylonians feared a seven-headed hydra 
and Typhon was the Egyptian dragon who persecuted 
Osiris. One wonders if these and the Chinese dragons are 
not race memories of conflicts with the diplodocus and like - 
monsters before their disappearance. Charles notes in the 
O.T. this monster as the chief enemy of God under such title 
as Rahab (Is. §1:9f.; Job 26:12f.), Behemoth (Job 40:1 5-24), 
Leviathan (Is. 27:1), the Serpent (Amos graff ones 
74:13 we read of “the heads of the dragons.’ On purros 
(red) see 6:4. Here (12:9) and in 20:2 the great dragon is 
identified with Satan. See Dan. 7 for many of the items 
here, like the ten horns (Dan. 7:7) and hurling the stars 
(Dan. 8:10). The word occurs in the Apocalypse alone in 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 389 


the N.T. Seven diadems (hepta diadémata). Old word from 
diadeé (to bind around), the blue band marked with white 
with which Persian kings used to bind on the tiara, so a 
royal crown in contrast with stephanos (chaplet or wreath 
like the Latin corona as in 2:10), in N.T. only here, 13:1; 
19:12. If Christ as Conqueror has “many diadems,” it is 
not strange that Satan should wear seven (ten in 13:1). 

4. His tail (hé oura autou). See g:10,19. Draweth (surei). 
Present active indicative of surd, old verb, to drag, here 
alone in the Apocalypse, but see John 21:8. The third part 
of the stars (to triton ton asteron). Like a great comet is this 
monster. See Dan. 8:10. Perhaps only the third is meant 
to soften the picture as in Rev. 8:7f. Did cast them (ebalen 
autous). Second aorist active indicative. Charles takes this 
to refer to a war in heaven between the good angels and 
Satan, with the fall of some angels (Jude 6). But John 
may have in mind the martyrs before Christ (Heb. 11:32f.) 
and after Christ’s ascension (Matt. 23:35). Stood (estéken). 
Imperfect active of a late verb, stékd, from the perfect 
hestéka of histemi, graphic picture of the dragon’s challenge 
of the woman who is about to give birth. When she was 
delivered (hotan tekéi). Indefinite temporal clause with hotan 
and the second aorist active subjunctive of #iktd, “whenever 
she gives birth.” That he might devour (hina kataphagii). 
Purpose clause with hing and the second aorist active sub- 
junctive of katesthid, to eat up (down). Cf. Jer. 28:34. 
This is what Pharaoh did to Israel (Ex. 1:15-22; Ps. 85:13; 
Is. 27:1; 51:9; Ezek. 29:3). Precisely so the devil tried to 
destroy the child Jesus on his birth. 

5. She was delivered of a son (eteken huion). Literally, 
“she bore a son” (second aorist active indicative of sikto). 
A man child (arsen). So A C with the neuter teknon or 
paidion in mind, as often in O.T. (eteken arsen, Ex. 1:16ff.; 
2:2; Lev. 12:2, 7; Is. 66:7; Jer. 20:15, etc.), but P and some 
cursives read arsena (masculine accusative), as in verse 13 


390 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(ton arsena), while Aleph Q have arrena. The word is old 
(either arsén or arrén), as in Matt. 19:4, only in this chapter 
in the Apocalypse. It is really redundant after Auion (son), 
as in Tob. 6:12 (Aleph). Who is to rule all the nations with 
a-rod of iron (hos mellei poimainein panta ta ethné en rabdoi 
sidérai). See 2:27 for these words (from Ps. 2:9) applied 
there to victorious Christians also, and in 19:15 to the tri- 
umphant Christian. His rule will go beyond the Jews 
(Matt. 2:6). There is here, of course, direct reference to 
the birth of Jesus from Mary, who thus represented in her 
person this “ideal woman” (God’s people). Was caught 
unto God (herpasthé). First aorist passive indicative of 
harpazd, old verb for seizing or snatching away, as in John 
10:12, here alone in the Apocalypse. Reference to the as- 
cension of Christ, with omission of the ministry, crucifixion, 
and resurrection of Christ because he is here simply show- 
ing that “the Dragon’s vigilance was futile” (Swete). “The 
Messiah, so far from being destroyed, is caught up to a share 
in God’s throne” (Beckwith). 

6. Fled into the wilderness (ephugen eis ten erémon). Second 
aorist active indicative of pheugd. Here, of course, not 
Mary, but “‘the ideal woman” (God’s people) of the pre- 
ceding verses, who fled under persecution of the dragon. 
God’s people do not at once share the rapture of Christ, 
but the dragon is unable to destroy them completely. The 
phrases used here seem to be reminiscent of Deut. 8:2ff.. 
(wanderings of Israel in the wilderness), I Kings 17:2f. and 
19:3f. (Elijah’s flight), I Macc. 2:29 (flight of the Jews 
from Antiochus Epiphanes), Matt. 2:13 (flight of Joseph 
and Mary to Egypt), Mark 13:14 (the flight of Christians 
at the destruction of Jerusalem). Where (hopou—ekei). 
Hebrew redundancy (where—there) as in 3:8; 8:2, 9; 13:8, 
12; 17:9; 20:8. Prepared (hétoimasmenon). Perfect passive 
predicate participle of hetoimazd, for which verb see Matt. 
20:23; Rev. ‘8:63 927, 1539162123 19:73) 27:2} and forvits ‘use

with ¢opos John 14:2f. and for the kind of fellowship meant 
by it (Ps. 31:21; II Cor. 13:13; Col. 3:3; I John 1:3). Of 
God (apo tou theou). ‘Krom (by) God,” marking the source 
as God (9:18; James 1:13). This anticipatory symbolism 
is repeated in 12:13f. . That there they may nourish her (hina 
ekei trephosin autén). Purpose clause with hina and the 
present for continued action: active subjunctive according 
to A P though C reads trephousin, present active indicative, 
as is possible also in 13:17 and certainly so in I John 5:20 
(Robertson, Grammar, p. 984), a solecism in late vernacular 
Greek. The plural is indefinite “they” as in 10:11; 11:9. 
One MSS. has ¢rephetai (is nourished). The stereotyped - 
phrase occurs here, as in 11:2f., for the length of the dragon’s 
power, repeated in 12:14 in more general terms and again 
MARZ: 

7. There was war in heaven (egeneto polemos en toi ourandi). 
“There came to be war in heaven” (egeneto, not én). “An- 
other tableau, not a sémeion (vv. 1, 3), but consequent upon 
the two sémeia which precede it. The birth and rapture 
of the Woman’s Son issue in a war which invades the 
epourania”’ (Swete). The reference is not to the original 
rebellion of Satan, as Andreas held. As the coming of 
Christ brought on fresh manifestations of diabolic power 
(Mark 1:13; Luke 22:3, 31; John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11), just 
so Christ’s return to heaven is pictured as being the occasion 
of renewed attacks there. We are not to visualize it too 
literally, but certainly modern airplanes help us to grasp the 
notion of battles in the sky even more than the phalanxes of 
storm-clouds (Swete). John even describes this last con- 
flict as in heaven itself. Cf. Luke 10:18; I Kings 22:1ff.; 
Job 1 and 2; Zech. 3:1ff. Michael and his angels (ho Michaél 
kai hoi aggeloi autou). The nominative here may be in 
apposition with polemos, but it is an abnormal construction 
with no verb, though egeneto (arose) can be understood as 
repeated. Michael is the champion of the Jewish people 


392 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(Dan. 10:13, 21; 12:1) and is called the archangel in Jude 9. 
Going forth to war (tou polemésai). This genitive articular 
infinitive is another grammatical problem in this sentence. 
If egeneto (arose) is repeated as above, then we have the 
infinitive for purpose, a common enough idiom. Otherwise 
it is anomalous, not even like Acts 10:25. With the dragon 
(meta tou drakontos). On the use of meta with polemeé see 
2:16; 13:4; 17:14 (nowhere else in N.T.). The devil has 
angels under his command (Matt. 25:41) and preachers also 
(II Cor. 11:14f.). Warred (epolemésen). Constative aorist 
active indicative of polemed, picturing the whole battle in 
one glimpse. 

8. And they prevailed not (kai ouk ischusan). Here kai 
equals “and yet” or “but.” A few MSS. read the singular 
ischusen like epolemésen, but wrongly so. Neither was their 
place found any more (oude topos heurethé auton eti). First 
aorist passive indicative of heuriskd, to find. Probably 
auton is the objective genitive (place for them), just as in 
20:11 autois (dative, for them) is used with topos ouch 
heurethé. The phrase occurs in Dan. 2:35 Theod. and Zech. 
10:10. The dragon is finally expelled from heaven (cf. Job 
1:6), though to us it seems a difficult conception to think of 
Satan having had access to heaven. 

9. Was cast down (eblethé). Effective first aorist passive 
indicative of ball, cast down for good and all, a glorious 
consummation. This vision of final victory over Satan is ° 
given by Jesus in Luke 10:18; John 12:31. It has not come 
yet, but it is coming, and the hope of it should be a spur 
to missionary activity and zeal. The word megas (great) 
occurs here with drakdn as in 12:3, and the whole picture is 
repeated in 20:2. The dragon in both places is identified 
with the old serpent (Gen. 3:1ff.) and called archaios (from 
arché, beginning), as Jesus said that the devil was a mur- 
derer “from the beginning” (John 8:44). Both diabolos 
(slanderer) and Satan (Satands) are common in N.T. for 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 393 


this great dragon and old serpent, the chief enemy of man- 
kind. See on Matt. 4:1 and Rev. 2:10 for diabolos and 
Luke 10:18 for Satanads. The-deceiver of the whole world (ho 
planon tén oikoumenén holén). This is his aim and his oc- 
cupation, pictured here by the nominative articular present 
active participle of planad, to lead astray. For “the in- 
habited world” see Luke 2:1; Rev. 3:10; 16:14. Satan can 
almost “lead astray” the very elect of God (Matt. 24:24), 
so artful is he in his beguilings as he teaches us how to de- 
ceive ourselves (I John 1:8). He was cast down to the earth 
(cblethé eis tén gén). Effective aorist repeated from the be- 
ginning of the verse. “The earth was no new sphere of . 
Satan’s working” (Swete). Were cast down (ebléthésan). 
Triple use of the same verb applied to Satan’s minions. 
The expulsion is complete. 

10. 4 great voice saying (phonén megalen legousan). Ac- 
cusative after ékousa in this phrase as in 5:11; 10:4; 14:2; 
18:4, but the genitive phonés legousés in 11:12; 14:13. We 
are not told whence this voice or song comes, possibly from 
one of the twenty-four elders (Swete) or some other heavenly 
beings (11:15) who can sympathize with human beings 
(19:10), the martyrs in heaven (Charles). Now 1s come 
(arti egeneto). Arti (John 13:33) shows how recent the 
downfall of Satan here proleptically pictured as behind us 
in time (aorist tense egeneto). The salvation (hé sotéria). 
Here ‘‘the victory” asin 7:10;19:1. The power (hé dunamis). 
God’s power over the dragon (cf. 7:12; 11:17; 19:1). The 
kingdom (hé basileia). “The empire of God” asin 11:15. The 
authority of his Christ (hé exousia tou Christou autou). Which 
Christ received from the Father (Matt. 28:18; John 17:2). 
See 11:15 (Ps. 2:2) for “his Anointed.” The accuser (ho 
kategor). The regular form, katégoros, occurs in John 8:10; 
Acts 23:30, 35; 25:16, 18 and in many MSS. here in Rev. 
12:10, but A reads katégor, which Westcott and Hort accept. 
It was once considered a Greek transliteration of a Hebrew

word, but Deissmann (Light, etc., p. 93f.) quotes it from a 
vernacular magical papyrus of the fourth century a.p. with 
no sign of Jewish or Christian influence, just as diakon 
appears as a vernacular form of diakonos. Only here is the 
word applied to Satan in the N.T. In late Judaism Satan 
is the accuser, and Michael the defender, of the faithful. 
Of our brethren (tin adelphin hémén). The saints still on 
earth battling with Satan and his devices. Which accuseth 
them (ho kategoron autous). Articular present active par- 
ticiple of katégored, old verb, to accuse, usually with the 
genitive of the person (John 5:45), but here with the ac- 
cusative. This is the devil’s constant occupation (Job 1:6f.). 
Day and night (hémeras kai nuktos). Genitive of time. “By 
day and by night.” 

11. They overcame him (autoi enikésan). First aorist ac- 
tive indicative of nikad, the verb used by Jesus of his own 
victory (John 16:33) and about him (Rev. 3:21; 5:5). “The 
victory of the martyrs marks the failure of Satan’s en- 
deavours” (Swete). Because of the blood of the Lamb (dia 
to haima tou arniou). As in 1:5; 5:6, 9; 7:14. The blood of 
Christ is here presented by dia as the ground for the victory 
and not the means, as by em in 1:5; 5:9. Both ideas are 
true, but dia with the accusative gives only the reason. 
The blood of Christ does cleanse us from sin (John 1:29; 
I John 1:7). Christ conquered Satan, and so makes our 
victory possible (Luke 11:21f.; Heb. 2:18). ‘Thus the — 
Lamb is the true sunégoros [like Michael] of the New Israel, 
its paraklétos pros ton patera (I John 2:1)” (Swete). Because 
of the Word of their testimony (dia ton logon tés marturias 
auton). The same use of dia, “because of their testimony 
to Jesus” as in John’s own case in 1:9. These martyrs 
have been true to their part. They loved not their life even 
unto death (ouk égapésan tén psuchén auton achri thanatou). 
First aorist active indicative of agapaé. They did resist 
“unto blood” (mechris haimatos Heb. 12:4) and did not put 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 395 


their own lives before loyalty to Christ. There is a direct 
reference to the words of Jesus in John 12:25 as illustrated 
also in Mark 8:35; Matt. 10:39; 16:25; Luke 9:24; 17:33. 
Paul’s own example is pertinent (Acts 21:13; Phil. 1:20ff.). 
Jesus himself had been “‘obedient unto death” (Phil. 2:8). 
These martyrs seem to be still alive on earth, but their 
heroism is proleptically pictured. 

12. Therefore (dia touto). “‘For this reason”’ as in 7:15; 
18:8 (15 times in John’s Gospel, Charles notes). It points 
back to verse 10. Rejoice (euphrainesthe). Present middle 
imperative of euphraind as in 11:10; 18:20. O heavens (hoi 
ouranoi). Plurai here alone in the Apocalypse, though com- 
mon elsewhere in the N.T. Satan is no longer in the heavens. 
They that dwell therein (hot en autois skénountes). Present 
active articular participle of skénod (see 7:15 and 13:6) to 
dwell (tabernacle) as of Christ in John 1:14 and of God in 
Rev. 21:3. The inhabitants of heaven (angels and saints) 
have cause to rejoice, and earth reason to mourn. Woe for 
the earth and for the sea (ouai ten gén kai ten thalassan). 
The accusative after ouai as in 8:13, but nominative in 
18:10, 16, 19 in place of the usual dative (Matt. 11:21; 
18:7, etc.). Is gone down (katebé). Second aorist (effective). 
active indicative of katabaind, “did go down.” But a short 
time (oligon kairon). Accusative of extent of time, “a little 
time.” The devil’s departure from his warfare in the heavens 
reveals (eidds, knowing, perfect active participle) to him 
that his time for doing harm to men is limited, and hence 
his great wrath (thumon, boiling rage). 

13. He persecuted (edidxen). First aorist active participle 
of diodkd, to pursue, to chase, hostile pursuit here as in 
Matt. 5:10f.; 10:23, etc. John now, after the “voice” in 
10 to 13, returns to the narrative in verse 9. The child was 
caught away in verse 5, and now the woman (the true Israel 
on earth) is given deadly persecution. Perhaps events since 


A.D. 64 (burning of Rome by Nero) amply illustrated this 


>

vision, and they still do so. Which (hétis). “‘Which very 


one. 

14. There were given (edothésan). As in 8:2; 9:1, 3. The 
two wings of the great eagle (hai duo pteruges tou aetou tou 
megalou). Not the eagle of 8:13, but the generic use of 
the article. Every eagle had two wings. Probably here, 
as in Matt. 24:28, the griffon or vulture rather than the 
true eagle is pictured. For the eagle in the O.T. see Ex. 
19:4; Is. 40:31; Job 9:26; Prov. 24:54. That she might fly 
(hina petetai). Purpose clause with hina and present middle 
subjunctive of petomai, old verb, to fly, in N.T. only in the 
Apocalypse (4:7; 8:13; 12:14; 14:6; 19:17). Resumption of 
the details in verse 6 (which see) about the “wilderness,” 
her “place,” the redundant ekei with hopou, the “‘time and 
times, and half a time” (kairon kai kairous kai hémisu), 
1260 days, but with trephetai (present passive indicative) 
instead of trephosin (general plural of the present active 
subjunctive), and with the addition of ‘“‘from the face of 
the serpent” (apo prosdpou tou opheds), because the serpent 
rules the earth for that period. “To the end of the present 
order the Church dwells in the wilderness” (Swete), and 
yet we must carry on for Christ. 

15. Water as a flood (hudor hos potamon). “Water as a 
river,” accusative case after edalen (cast). The serpent 
could not follow the woman or stop her flight and so sought 
to drown her. That he might cause her to be carried away 
by the stream (hina autén potamophoréton poiéséi). Purpose 
clause with Aina and the first aorist active subjunctive of 
poied. For this use of poied see 17:16. This compound 
verbal potamophoréton in the predicate accusative (potamos, 
river, phoréton from phored, to bear) was not coined by 
John, but occurs in a papyrus of B.c. 110 and in several 
others after N.T. times. It means simply “carried awav 
by the river.” 

16. Helped the woman (eboéthésen tei gunaiki). First aorist 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 397 


active indicative of doéthed, old verb with the dative as in 
Heb. 2:18, which see. Herodotus tells of the Lycus dis- 
appearing underground near Colossae. But this vivid sym- 
bol is not dependent on historical examples. Swallowed up 
(katepien). Second aorist active indicative of katapind, lit- 
erally “drank down.” 

17. Waxed wroth (orgisthé). First aorist (ingressive) pas- 
sive indicative of orgizomai, “became angry.” With the 
woman (epi tei gunaiki). “At the woman,” “because of 
the woman.” Went away (apélthen). ‘Went off” in his 
rage to make war with the scattered followers of the Lamb 
not in the wilderness, perhaps an allusion to Gen. 3:15.” 
The devil carries on relentless war with all those ‘which 
keep the commandments of God and hold the testimony 
of Jesus” (¢6n térounton tas entolas tou theou kai echonton 
tén marturian Iésou). These two marks excite the wrath of 
the devil then and always. Cf. 1:9; 6:9; 14:12; 19:10; 20:4. 

18. He stood (estathé). First aorist passive indicative of 
histémi (intransitive), as in 8:3. “He stopped” on his way 
to war with the rest of the woman’s seed. P Q read here 
estathen (I stood) when it has to be connected with chapter 
13. Upon the sand (epi ten ammon). The accusative case 
as in 7:1; 8:3, etc. Ammos is an old word for sand, for 
innumerable multitude in 20:8. 


CHAPTER XIII 


1. Out of the sea (ek tés thalassés). See 11:7 for “the beast 
coming up out of the abyss.” The imagery comes from 
Dan. 7:3. See also Rev. 17:8. This “wild beast from the 
sea,” as in Dan. 7:17, 23, is a vast empire used in the in- 
terest of brute force. This beast, like the dragon (12:3), 
has ten horns and seven heads, but the horns are crowned, 
not the heads. The Roman Empire seems to be meant 
here (17:9, 12). On “diadems”’ (diadémata) see 12:3, only 
ten here, not seven as there. Names of blasphemy (onomata 
blasphémias). See 17:3 for this same phrase. The meaning 
is made plain by the blasphemous titles assumed by the 
Roman emperors in the first and second centuries, as shown 
by the inscriptions in Ephesus, which have ¢heos constantly 
applied to them. 

2. Like unto a leopard (homoion pardalei). Associative- 
instrumental case of pardalis, old word for panther, leopard, 
here only in N.T. The leopard (/eo, pard) was considered a 
cross between a panther and a lioness. 4s the feet of a bear 
(és arkou). Old word, also spelled arktos, here only in 
N.T. From Dan. 7:4. No word in the Greek for “feet” 
before “bear.” 4s the mouth of a lion (hds stoma leontos). ° 
From Dan. 7:4. This beast combines features of the first 
three beasts in Dan. 7:2ff. The strength and brutality of 
the Babylonian, Median, and Persian empires appeared in 
the Roman Empire. The catlike vigilance of the leopard, 
the slow and crushing power of the bear, and the roar of 
the lion were all familiar features to the shapes in Pales- 
tine (Swete). The dragon gave him (edoken autoi ho drakon). 
First aorist active indicative of diddmi (to give) and dative 
case autoi (the beast). The dragon works through this beast. 

398 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 399 


The beast is simply Satan’s agent. Satan claimed this power 
to Christ (Matt. 4:9; Luke 4:6) and Christ called Satan the 
prince of this world (John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11). So the 
war is on. 

3. And I saw (kai). No verb (eidon) in the old MSS., 
but clearly understood from verse 2. 4s though it had been 
smitten (his esphagmenén). Perfect passive participle of 
Sphazo, as in §:6, accusative singular agreeing with mian 
(one of the heads), object of eidon understood, ‘‘as though 
slain” (so the word means in seven other instances in the 
book). There is a reference to the death and new life of 
the Lamb in 5:6. And his death-stroke was healed (kai hé- 
plégé autou etherapeuthé). First aorist passive indicative of 
therapeuod. ““The stroke of death” (that led to death). 
Apparently refers to the death of Nero in June 68 a.p. by 
his own hand. But after his death pretenders arose claim- 
ing to be Nero redivivus even as late as 89 (Tacitus, Hist. 
i. 78, ii. 8, etc.). John seems to regard Domitian as Nero 
over again in the persecutions carried on by him. The dis- 
tinction is not always preserved between the beast (Roman 
Empire) and the seven heads (emperors), but in 17:10 the 
beast survives the loss of five heads. Here it is the death- 
stroke of one head, while in verses 12, 14 the beast himself 
receives a mortal wound. Wondered after the beast (ethau- 
masthé opiso tou thériou). First aorist passive (deponent) 
indicative of thaumazd, to wonder at, to admire, as in 17:8. 
For this pregnant use of opisd see John 12:9; Acts §:37; 
20:30; I Tim. 5:15. “All the earth wondered at and fol- 
lowed after the beast,” that is Antichrist as represented by 
Domitian as Nero redivivus. But Charles champions the 
view that Caligula, not Nero, is the head that received the 
death-stroke and recovered and set up statues of himself 
for worship, even trying to do it in Jerusalem. 

4. They worshipped the dragon (prosekunésan toi drakonti). 
First aorist active indicative of proskuned, with dative case 


400 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


drakonti (from drakon). They really worshipped Satan (the 
dragon) when “they worshipped the beast” (prosekunésan 
toi theridi) or any one of the heads (like Caligula, Nero, 
Domitian) of the beast. The beast is merely the tool of 
the devil for worship. Recall the fact that the devil even 
proposed that Jesus worship him. Emperor-worship, like 
all idolatry, was devil-worship. The same thing is true 
today about self-worship (humanism or any other form of 
it). Who is like unto the beast? (tis homotios toi thériot;). 
Associative-instrumental case after homoios. An echo, per- 
haps parody, of like language about God in Ex. 15:11; Ps. 
35:10; 113:5. ““The worship of such a monster as Nero was 
indeed a travesty of the worship of God” (Swete). dnd 
who is able to war with him? (kai tis dunatai polemésai met 
autou;). Worship of the devil and the devil’s agent is justi- 
fied purely on the ground of brute force. It is the doctrine 
of Nietzsche that might makes right. 

5. There was given to him (edothé autoi). First aorist 
passive indicative of diddmi, to give, as in next line and 
verse 7. Perhaps a reference to edoken (he gave) in verse 4, 
where the dragon (Satan) gave the beast his power. The 
ultimate source of power is God, but the reference seems 
to be Satan here. Speaking great things and blasphemies 
(laloun megala kai blasphémias). Present active participle 
of Jaled, agreeing with stoma (nominative neuter singular 
and subject of edothé). The words are like Daniel’s descrip- 
tion of the Little Horn (7:8, 20, 25) and like the description 
of Antiochus Epiphanes (I Macc. 1:24). Cf. II Pet. 2:11. 
To continue (poiésai). First aorist active infinitive (epexe- 
getic use) of poied, either in the sense of working (signs), 
as in Dan. 8:12, 14, with the accusative of duration of time 
(ménas months), or more likely in the sense of doing time, 
with ménas as the direct object as in Matt. 20:12; Acts 
20:3; James 4:13. 

6. For blasphemies (eis blasphémias). “For the purpose 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 401 


of blasphemies.” Against God (pros ton theon). ‘Face to 
face with God” in sheer defiance, like Milton’s picture of 
Satan in Paradise Lost. See Dan. 7:25; 8:10. The aorist 
énoixen is probably constative, for he repeated the blas- 
phemies, though the phrase (anoigd to stoma, to open the 
mouth) is normally ingressive of the beginning of an utter- 
ance (Matt. 5:2; Acts 8:35). This verse explains verse 5. 
The Roman emperors blasphemously assumed divine names 
in public documents. They directed their blasphemy against 
heaven itself (“his tabernacle,” sé skénén autou, 7:15; 
12:12; 21:3) and against “them that dwell in the heaven” 
(tous en toi ourandi skénountas), the same phrase of 12:12 
(either angels or the redeemed or both). 

7. To make war with the saints and to overcome them 
(poiésai polemon meta ton hagion kai nikésai autous). ‘This 
clause with two epexegetical first aorist active infinitives 
(polemésai and nikésai) is omitted in A C P, but probably 
by homeoteleuton (like ending) because of the repetition of 
edothé. The words seem to come from Dan. 7:21, 23. There 
was no escape from the beast’s rule in the Mediterranean 
world. See 5:9 for the phrases here used, there for praise 
to the Lamb. 

8. Shall worship him (proskunésousin auton). Future ac- 
tive of proskuned with the accusative here as some MSS. 
in 13:4 (¢o thérion), both constructions in this book. Whose 
(hou—autou). Redundant use of genitive autou (his) with 
hou (whose) as common in this book, and singular instead 
of plural hon with antecedent pantes (all, plural), thus call- 
ing attention to the responsibility of the individual in em- 
peror-worship. Hath not been written (ou gegraptai). Per- 
fect passive indicative of graphd, permanent state, stands 
written. In the book of life of the Lamb (en toi biblio: tes 
z0és tou arniou). See 3:5 for this phrase and the O.T. 
references. It occurs again in 17:8; 20:12, 15; 21:27. “Here 
and in 21:27, the Divine Register is represented as belong- 


402 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


ing to ‘the Lamb that was slain’”’ (Swete). That hath been 
slain from the foundation of the world (tou esphagmenou (for 
which see 5:6) apo katabolés kosmou). For the phrase apo 
katabolés kosmou (not in the LXX) there are six other N.T. 
uses (Matt. 13:35 without kosmou; 25:34; Luke 11:50; Heb. 
4:3; 9:26; Rev. 17:8), and for pro kataboles kosmou three 
(John 17:24; Eph. 1:4; I Pet. 1:20). It is doubtful here 
whether it is to be taken with tou esphagmenou (cf. I Pet. 
1:20) or with gegraptai as in Rev. 17:8. Either makes sense, 
and here the most natural use is with esphagmenou. At any 
rate the death of Christ lies in the purpose of God, as in 
John 3:16. 

g. If any one hath an ear (ei tis echei ous). Condition of 
first class, repetition of the saying in 2:7, II, 17, 29, etc. 

10. If any man is for captivity (ei tis eis aichmalosian). 
Condition of first class, but with no copula (esti) expressed. 
For aichmalosian (from aichmalotos captive) see Eph. 4:8, 
only other N.T. example. Apparently John means this as 
a warning to the Christians not to resist force with force, 
but to accept captivity as he had done as a means of grace. 
Cf. Jer. 15:2. The text is not certain, however. If any 
man shall kill with the sword (ei tis en machairéi apoktenet). 
First-class condition with future active of apokteind, not 
future passive, for it is a picture of the persecutor drawn 
here like that by Jesus in Matt. 26:52. Must he be killed 
(dei auton en machairéi apoktanthénai). First aorist passive: 
infinitive of apokteind. The inevitable conclusion (dei) of 
such conduct. The killer is killed. Here (Adde). In this 
attitude of submission to the inevitable. For hdde see 13:18; 
14:12; 17:9. “Faith” (pistis) here is more like faithfulness, 
fidelity. 

11. Another beast (allo therion). Like the first beast (verse 
1), not a heteron thérion (a different beast). Out of the earth 
(ek tes gés). Not “out of the sea” as the first (verse 1), 
perhaps locating him in Asia Minor without world-wide 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 403 


scope, but plainly the agent of the first beast and so of the 
dragon. He had (eichen). Imperfect active of echd. Only 
two horns (not ten like the first, verse 1). Like unto a lamb 
(homoia arnioi). Usual construction. Only the two horns 
of a young lamb and without the ferocity of the other beast, 
but “he spake as a dragon” (elalei hos drakon). Gunkel and 
Charles confess their inability to make anything out of 
this item. But Swete thinks that he had the roar of a 
dragon with all the looks of a lamb (weakness and innocence). 
Cf. the wolves in sheep’s clothing (Matt. 7:15). 

12. He exerciseth (poiei). Present active dramatic present 
of poied. In his sight (endpion autou). In the eye of the. 
first beast who gets his authority from the dragon (13:2). 
The second beast carries on the succession of authority from 
the dragon and the first beast. It has been a common 
Protestant interpretation since the Reformation of Luther 
to see in the first beast Pagan Rome and in the second beast 
Papal Rome. There is undoubted verisimilitude in this 
interpretation, but it is more than doubtful if any such view 
comes within the horizon of the imagery here. Ramsay 
takes the first beast to be the power of imperial Rome and 
the second beast to be the provincial power which imitated 
Rome in the persecutions. To worship the first beast (hina 
proskunésousin to thérion to proton). Sub-final clause with 
hina after poiei seen in John 11:37; Col. 4:16; Rev. 3:9, 
usually with the subjunctive, but here with the future in- 
dicative as in 3:9. Note the accusative after proskuneo as 
in verse 8. Here the death-stroke of one of the heads (verse 
3) is ascribed to the beast. Clearly the delegated authority 
of the provincial priests of the emperor-worship is rigorously 
enforced, if this is the correct interpretation. 

13. That he should even make fire come down out of heaven 
(hina kai pur poiti ck tou ouranou katabainein). Purpose 
clause again with hina and the present active subjunctive - 
of poied and the object infinitive of katabaind after potei. 


404 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Christ promised great signs to the disciples (John 14:12), 
but he also warned them against false prophets and false 
christs with their signs and wonders (Mark 13:22). So also 
Paul had pictured the power of the man of sin (II Thess. 
2:9). Elijah had called down fire from heaven (I Kings 
18:38; II Kings 1:10) and James and John had once even 
urged Jesus to do this miracle (Luke 9:54). 

14. And he deceiveth (kai planai). Present active (dra- 
matic) indicative of planad, the very thing that Jesus had 
said would happen (Matt. 24:24, “So as to lead astray” 
hoste planasthai, the word used here, if possible the very 
elect). It is a constant cause for wonder, the gullibility of 
the public at the hands of new charlatans who continually 
bob up with their pipe-dreams. That they should make an 
image to the beast (poiésai eikona toi thérioi). Indirect com- 
mand (this first aorist active infinitive of poied) after legin 
as in Acts 21:21, not indirect assertion. This “image” 
(etkon, for which word see Matt. 22:20; Col. 1:15) of the 
emperor could be his head upon a coin (Mark 12:16), an 
imago painted or woven upon a standard, a bust in metal or 
stone, a statue, anything that people could be asked to 
bow down before and worship. This test the priests in the 
provinces pressed as it was done in Rome itself. The phrase 
“the image of the beast,” occurs ten times in this book 
(13:14,°15 fers 1429, 13 15:2; 16:2; '19:20;:20:4), »Emperor- 
worship is the issue and that involves worship of the devil. . 
The stroke of the sword (tén plegén tés machairés). This 
language can refer to the death of Nero by his own sword. 
And lived (kai exésen). “And he came to life” (ingressive 
first aorist active indicative of za0). - Perhaps a reference to 
Domitian as a second Nero in his persecution of Christians. 

15. To give breath to it (dounai pneuma aut?i). This sec- 
ond beast, probably a system like the first (not a mere 
person), was endowed with the power to work magical 
tricks, as was true of Simon Magus and Apollonius of Tyana 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 405 


and many workers of legerdemain since. Pneuma here has 
its original meaning of breath or wind like pneuma xoés 
(breath of life) in 11:11. Even to the image (tei eikoni). 
No “even” in the Greek, just apposition with auféi (her). 
That should both speak and cause (hina kai laleséi kai poiéséi). 
Final clause with Aina and the first aorist active subjunctive 
of Jaled and poied. Ventriloquism like that in Acts 16:16. 
That should be killed (hina apoktanthosin). Sub-final clause 
with Aina and the first aorist passive subjunctive of apok- 
teind, after poiéséi, as in verse 12 (future indicative). 4s 
many as should not worship (hosoi ean mé proskunésosin). 
Indefinite relative clause with modal ean (=an) and the. 
first aorist active subjunctive of proskuned with the accusa- 
tive én eikona (some MSS. the dative). Note the triple 
use of “the image of the beast” in this sentence. ‘‘That 
refusal to worship the image of the emperor carried with 
it capital punishment in Trajan’s time is clear from Pliny’s 
letter to Trajan (X. 96)” (Charles). 

16. He causeth all (same use of poied as in 12 and 15). 
Note article here with each class (the small and the great, 
etc.). That there be given them (hina dosin autois). Same 
use of hina after poied as in 12 and 15, only here with in- 
definite plural désin (second aorist active subjunctive), “that 
they give themselves,” as in 10:11; 12:6; 16:15. 4 mark 
(charagma). Old word from charassd, to engrave, in Acts 
17:29 of idolatrous images, but in Rev. (13:16, 17; 14:9, 
I1; 16:2; 19:20; 20:4) of the brand of the beast on the right 
hand or on the forehead or on both. Deissmann (Bible 
Studies, pp. 240ff.) shows that in the papyri official business 
documents often have the name and image of the emperor, 
with the date as the official stamp or seal and with charagma 
as the name of this seal. Animals and slaves were often 
branded with the owner’s name, as Paul (Gal. 6:17) bore 
the stigmata of Christ. Ptolemy Philadelphus compelled 


some Alexandrian Jews to receive the mark of Dionysus 


406 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


as his devotees (III Macc. 3:29). The servants of God re- 
ceive on their foreheads the stamp of the divine seal (Rev. 
7:3). Charles is certain that John gets his metaphor from 
the ¢ephillin (phylacteries) which the Jew wore on his left 
hand and on his forehead. At any rate, this ‘“mark of the 
beast” was necessary for life and all social and business 
relations. On the right hand, that is in plain sight. Upon 
their forehead (epi to metopon auton). Accusative with epi, 
though genitive Just before with cheiros (hand). See already 
7:33 9:4 (genitive epi ton metopon). Only in the Apocalypse 
in N.T. 

17. That no man should be able to buy or to sell (hina mé 
tis dunétai agorasai @ polésai). Final clause with hina and 
present middle subjunctive of dunamai with aorist active 
infinitives. This is a regular boycott (Ramsay, Seven Letters, 
p. 106f.) against all not worshippers of the emperor. Save 
(et me). “If not,” “except.” Even the name (to onoma). 
No “even,” just apposition with charagma (the mark). Or 
the number (é ton arithmon). The stamp (the mark) may 
bear either the name or the number of the beast. The name 
and the number are one and the same. They could write 
the name in numerals, for numbers were given by letters. 
Swete suggests that it was “‘according to a sort of gematria 
known to the Apocalyptist and his Asian readers, but not 
generally intelligible.” 

18. Here is wisdom (hide hé sophia). The puzzle that . 
follows as in 17:9. See Eph. 1:17 for “a spirit of wisdom 
and of understanding.” He that understands (ho echon noun). 
“The one having intelligence” in such matters. Cf. the 
adverb nounechdos (discreetly) in Mark 12:34. Let him count 
(psephisato). First active imperative of pséphizd, old verb 
(from pséphos pebble), to count, in N.T. only here and Luke 
14:28. The number of a man (arithmos anthripou). “A 
man’s number.” But what man and what name? Six 
hundred and sixty-six (hexakosioi hexekonta hex). Unfor- 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 407 


tunately some MSS. here read 616 instead of 666. Alf sorts 
of solutions are offered for this conundrum. Charles is 
satisfied with the Hebrew letters for Nero Cesar, which 
give 666, and with the Latin form of Nero (without the 
final n), which makes 616. Surely this is ingenious and it 
may be correct. But who can really tell? 


CHAPTER XIV 


1. The Lamb (to arnion). See 5:6; 7:17; 12:11; 13:8 and 
is in contrast with the anarthrous arnion in 13:11. This 
proleptic vision of the Lamb “standing on the mount Zion” 
(hestos epi to oros Sion, second perfect active participle 
neuter of histémi with epi and accusative) is reasoning after 
the visions of the two beasts. Mount Zion is the site of 
the new city of God (Heb. 12:22), the Jerusalem above 
(Gal. 4:26), the seat of the Messianic Kingdom whether 
heaven or the new earth (Rev. 21 and 22). These victors 
have the name of the Lamb and God upon their foreheads 
as in 3:12 and 22:4, in place of the mark of the beast above 
(13:16; 14:11). This seal protects them (9:4). 4 hundred 
and forty and four thousand (hekaton tesserakonta tessares 
chiliades). “Thousands” literally (chi/ias feminine word for 
a thousand and so echousai feminine plural). For the 144,000 
see 7:5, 8, though some scholars seek a distinction somehow. 

2. As a voice of many waters (hos phonén hudaton pollon). 
For which see 1:15. Of a@ great thunder (brontés megalés). 
For which see 6:1; 19:6. For this voice out of heaven see 
10:4; 14:15; 18:4 and note accusative with @kousa. As the 
voice of harpers harping with their harps (hos kitharoidon. 
kitharizonton en tais kitharais auton). Triple use of kithara 
(5:8), kitharoidon (18:22), kitharizonton (old verb kithariz6, 
in N.T. only here and I Cor. 14:7). Wonderful melody in 
this chorus by the angels, not by the 144,000. 

3. They sing as it were a new song (aidousin hos oiden 
kainén). See §:9 for this phrase (cognate accusative) save 
that here Ads (as if) is added. There the new song was 
sung by the four living creatures and the elders, but here 
“before” (endpion) them and so apparently by the thron 

408 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 409 


who were themselves redeemed by the Lamb. No man could 
learn the song save (oudeis edunato mathein tén didén ei mé). 
Imperfect (edunato) of dunamai and second aorist (ingres- 
sive) active infinitive of manthand. In 5:9-12 the angels 
join in the song. In.15:3 it is the Song of Moses and the 
Lamb. Even they that had been purchased out of the earth 
(hoi égorasmenoi apo tés gés). Perfect passive articular par- 
ticiple of agorazd, purchased by the blood of the Lamb (5:9), 
masculine plural in apposition with chiliades (thousands) 
feminine plural (7:5, 8; 14:1). 4po (from) here, though e& 
(out of) in §:9. The 144,000 are not yet separated from the 
earth (John 17:15). Whether the 144,000 here are identical ~ 
with that number in 7:4-8 or not, they must embrace both 
men and women. 

4. Were not defiled with women (meta gunaikon ouk emo- 
lunthésan). First aorist passive indicative of molund, old 
verb, to stain, already in 3:4, which see. The use of this 
word rules out marriage, which was not considered sinful. 
For they are virgins (parthenoi gar eisin). Parthenos can be 
applied to men as well as women. Swete takes this lan- 
guage “‘metaphorically, as the symbolical character of the 
Book suggests.” Charles considers it an interpolation in 
the interest of celibacy for both men and women. If taken 
literally, the words can refer only to adultery or fornication 
(Beckwith). Jesus recognised abstinence only for those able 
to receive it (Matt. 19:12), as did Paul (I Cor. 7:1, 8, 32, 36). 
Marriage is approved by Paul in I Tim. 4:3 and by Heb. 
13:4. The New Testament exalts marriage and this passage 
should not be construed as degrading it. Whithersoever he 
goeth (hopou an hupagei). Indefinite local clause with modal 
an and the present active indicative of hupagd. The Chris- 
tian life is following the Lamb of God as Jesus taught 
(Mark 2:14; 10:21; Luke 9:59; John 1:43; 21:19, etc.) and 
as Peter taught (I Pet. 2:21) and John (I John 2:6). Were 
purchased from among men (égorasthésan apo ton anthropon). 


410 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


First aorist passive indicative of agorazd, repeating the close 
of verse 3. First fruits (aparché). See for this word I Cor. 
16:15; Rom. 11:16; 16:5. This seems to mean that the 
144,000 represent not the whole, but only a portion of the 
great harvest to come (Matt. 9:37), not only the first in- 
stalment, but those marked by high spiritual service to 
God and the Lamb (Rom. 12:1; Heb. 13:15; I Pet. 2:5). 

5. Was found no lie (ouch heurethé pseudos). First aorist 
passive indicative of heuriskd. In I Pet. 2:23 this passage 
(Is. 53:9) is quoted with dolos (deceit, guile) instead of 
pseudos (lie), but the difference is not great. Without 
blemish (amomoi). Alpha privative and mdmos (blemish, 
spot). As Christ the Paschal Lamb is (I Pet. 1:19; Heb. 
g:14), so the followers of the Lamb are to be in the end 
(Phil $233 ae 

6. Another angel (allon aggelon). A new turn in the drama 
comes with each angel (7:2; 8:3, 13; 10:1). Here the angel 
is seen “flying in mid heaven” (petomenon en mesourané- 
mati), while in 8:13 John heard him “flying in mid heaven” 
(genitive case of same participle, which see). This one is 
in the sight and hearing of all. Having (echonta). Accusa- 
tive singular agreeing with agge/on like petomenon (flying), 
but /egdn in verse 7 is nominative, as if a new sentence like 
legon in 4:1. An eternal gospel (euaggelion aionion). ‘The 
only use of euaggelion i in John’ s writings, though the verb 
euaggelisai (first aorist active infinitive epexegetical with 
echonta like John 16:12) occurs here and in 10:7. Here it 
Is not fo euaggelion (the gospel), but merely a proclamation 
of God’s eternal (aidnios here alone in the Apocalypse, 
though common in the Fourth Gospel and I John) purpose. 
Origen even took this ‘“‘eternal gospel” to be another book 
to be written! Note the double use of epi (with accusative 
after euaggelisai and the genitive with gés). See §:9 for 
the races, etc. 


7. And he saith (legon). See above. Fear God (phobéethéte 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 4Il 


ton theon). First aorist passive (deponent) imperative of 
phobeomai, here transitive with the accusative as in Luke 
12:5. It is a call to judgment with no hope offered except 
by implication (Acts 14:15ff.). Give him glory (dote autoi 
doxan). Second aorist active indicative of didami. For 
the phrase see 11:13. The hour is come (hé hora élthen). 
Second aorist (prophetic use) active indicative of erchomai. 
Common idiom in John’s Gospel (2:4; 4:21, 23; 5:25, 28; 
7:30, etc.). Worship (proskunésate). First aorist active 
imperative of proskuned with the dative case. Solemn call 
to the pagan world to worship God as Creator (4:11; 10:6), 
as in Ps. 96:6; Acts 14:15. For “the fountains of waters” — 
see 8:10. 

8. Another, a second angel (allos deuteros aggelos). This 
second angel “‘followed”’ (2kolouthésen, first aorist active in- 
dicative of akolouthed) and interpreted in part the first one. 
Fallen, fallen (epesen, epesen). Prophetic aorist active in- 
dicative of pipto, repeated as a solemn dirge announcing 
the certainty of the fall. The English participle “fallen, 
fallen” is more musical and rhythmical than the literal 
rendering “fell, fell.” The language is an echo of Is. 21:9, 
though B in the LXX has peptoken, peptoken (perfect). 
Babylon the great (Babulon hé magalé). The adjective megalé 
occurs with Babulon each time in the Apocalypse (14:8; 
16:19; 17:5; 18:2, 10, 21) as a reminder of Nebuchadrezzar. 
There is no doubt that Rome is meant by Babylon, as is 
probably seen already in I Pet. 5:13. As a prisoner in 
Patmos John can speak his mind by this symbolism. Hath 
made to drink (pepotiken). Perfect active indicative of 
potizd, old causative verb (from potos drinking, I Pet. 4:3), 
as in Matt. 25:35. The remarkable phrase that follows 
seems based on Jer. 51:8 (25:15). It is a combination also 
of Rev. 14:10 (the wine of God’s wrath, also in 16:19; 
19:15) and 17:2. There is no doubt of the dissoluteness of 
the old Babylon of Jeremiah’s day as of the Rome of John’s 


412 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


time. Rome is pictured as the great courtesan who in- 
toxicates and beguiles the nations to fornication (17:2, 4, 6), 
but the cup of God’s wrath for her and her paramours is 
full (14:10; 16:19; 18:2). 

g. A third (tritos). “The third of this succession of herald 
angels denounces the Cesar-worshippers” (Swete). Cf. 
13:12. This counter proclamation (verses 9-12) warns 
those tempted to yield to the threats of the second beast 
about boycott and death (13:11-17). If any man worship- 
peth the beast and his image (ei tis proskunei to thérion kat 
tén eikona autou). Condition of first class challenging those 
afraid of the beast. Note accusative (thérion) after pros- 
kunei, not dative as in verse 7. And receiveth a mark (kat 
lambanei charagma). Carries on the same condition and 
picks up the very language of 13:16. These Czsar-wor- 
shippers are guilty of an “eternal sin” (Mark 3:29). 

10. He also shall drink (kai autos pietai). Future middle 
of pind. Certainty for him as for Babylon and her para- 
mours (16:17). Of the wine of the wrath of God (ek tou oinou 
tou thumou tou theou). Note ek (partitive) after pietai. In 
16:19 and 19:15 we have both thumou and orgés (wrath of 
the anger of God). The white heat of God’s anger, held 
back through the ages, will be turned loose. Prepared un- 
mixed (tou kekerasmenou akratou). A bold and powerful 
oxymoron, “the mixed unmixed.” Akratos is an old ad- 
jective (alpha privative and kerannumi to mix) used of 
wine unmixed with water (usually so mixed), here only in 
N.T. So it is strong wine mixed (perfect passive participle 
of kerannumi) with spices to make it still stronger (cf. Ps. 
75:9). In the cup of his anger (en toi potéerioi tés orgés autou). 
Both thumos (vehement fury) and orgé (settled indignation). 
He shall be tormented (basanisthésetai). Future passive of 
basanizo. See 9:5; 11:10. With fire and brimstone (en puri 
kai theioi). See 9:17 for fire and brimstone and also 19:20; 
20:10; 21:8. The imagery is already in Gen. 19:24; Is. 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 413 


30:33; Ezek. 38:22. In the presence of the holy angels and 
in the presence of the Lamb (endpion aggelon hagion kai 
enopion tou arniou). This holy environment adds to the 
punishment. 

11. The smoke of their torment (ho kapnos tou basanismou 
auton). See 9:5 for basanismos, only there it was a limited 
penalty, here it is “for ever and ever” (eis aionas aionon, 
unto ages of ages). See also 18:9; 19:3; 20:10. They have 
no rest (ouk echousin anapausin). The very language used 
in 4:8 of the four living creatures in praising God. “Those 
who desert Christ for Czsar will be the victims of a remorse 
that never dies or sleeps” (Swete). The rest of the verse 
repeats the solemn challenge of verse 9. 

12. Here is the patience of the saints (Hide hé hupomoné 
ton hagion estin). John’s own comment as in 13:10; 17:9. 
In this struggle against emperor worship lay their oppor- 
tunity (Rom. 5:3). It was a test of loyalty to Christ. They 
that keep (hoi térountes). In apposition with ton hagion 
(genitive), though nominative, a frequent anacoluthon in 
this book (2:20, etc.). Cf. 12:17. The faith of Fesus (tén 
pistin Iésou). “The faith in Jesus” (objective genitive) as 
in 2:13; Mark 11:22; James 2:1. 

13. Write (Grapson). First aorist active imperative of 
grapho as in 1:11. John’s meditation is broken by this 
command. This new beatitude (makarioi, Blessed) for the 
Christian dead goes farther than Paul’s words (I Thess. 
4:14-16; I Cor. 15:18). Probably “from henceforth” (ap’ 
arti) goes with “those who die in the Lord,” giving comfort 
to those facing persecution and death. That they may rest 
(hina anapaesontai). Purpose clause with hina and the 
second future passive of anapaud. From their labours (ek 
ton kopon auton). From the toils, the wearinesses, but not 
from the activities (erga), for these “follow with them.” 
There is this to comfort us for all our growth here. Even 


414 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


if cut short, it can be utilized in heaven, which is not a 
place of idleness, but of the highest form of spiritual service. 

14. 4 white cloud (nephelé leuké). Like the “bright cloud” 
of Matt. 17:5 (Transfiguration), a familiar object in the 
Mediterranean lands. See Dan. 7:13; Matt. 24:30; 26:64; 
Acts 1:9, 11 for the picture of Christ’s return. I saw one 
sitting (kathémenon). No eidon here, but the accusative 
follows the eidon at the beginning, as nephelé is nominative 
after idou, as in 4:1, 4. Like unto a son of man (homoion 
huion anthropou). Accusative here after homoion as in 1:13, 
instead of the usual associative instrumental (13:4). Having 
(echon). Nominative again after the idou construction, just 
before, not after, eidon. A golden crown (stephanon chru- 
soun). Here a golden wreath, not the diadems of 19:12. 
4 sharp sickle (drepanon oxu). Old form drepané (from 
drepo, to pluck), pruning-hook, in N.T. only in this chapter 
and Mark 4:29. Christ is come for reaping this time (Heb. 
9:28) for the harvesting of earth (verses 15-17). The priest- 
hood of Christ is the chief idea in 1:12-20 and “‘as the true 
Imperator” (Swete) in chapter 19. 

15. Send forth (pempson). First aorist (urgency) active 
imperative of pempo. “Thrust in thy sickle now,” this 
angel urges Christ. And reap (kai therison). First aorist 
(urgency) active imperative of ¢herizd, old verb (from theros, 
summer), as in Matt. 6:26. See verse 7 for “‘the hour 1s 
come.” Therisai (to reap) is epexegetical infinitive (first 
aorist active of therizo). The harvest (ho therismos). Old, 
but rare word (from therizd, to harvest), as in Matt. 13:30; 
John 4:35, here only in Revelation. Is over-ripe (exéranthé). 
First aorist (prophetic as in 10:17; 15:1) passive of xéraind 
(cf. James 1:11), to wither, to dry up. Perhaps just “ripe,” 
hot Sower-riper? Ch Joel sary: 

16. Cast (ebalen). Second aorist active indicative of da/lé. 
No violence by the use of ebalen as is seen in Matt. 10:34 
(balein eirénén, to bring peace). Was reaped (etheristhé). 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 4ts 


First aorist passive indicative of therizd. Both prophetic 
aorists again. Christ puts in the sickle as he wills with his 
own agents (Matt. 9:37f.; 13:39, 41). 

17. He also (kai autos). As well as the Reaper on the 
cloud. This is the fifth angel who is God’s messenger from 
heaven (temple where God dwells). This fifth angel with 
his sharp sickle is to gather the vintage (18-20) as Christ 
did the wheat. 

18. Another angel (allos aggelos). The fifth angel above 
Swete terms “the Angel of vengeance.”” He responds to the 
call of the sixth angel here as Christ does to the call of the 
fourth angel in verse 15. Out from the altar (ek tou thusias- 
tériou). From the altar of incense where he is in charge of 
the fire (exousian epi tou puros). If it is the altar of burnt 
offering (6:9; 11:1), we are reminded of the blood of the 
martyrs (Swete), but if the altar of incense (8:3, 5; 9:13; 
16:7), then of the prayers of the saints. The sharp sickle 
(to drepanon to oxu). Useful for vintage as for harvesting. 
So “‘send forth” (pempson) asin verse 15. Gather (trugéson). 
First aorist active imperative of trugad, old verb (from trugé 
dryness, ripeness), in N.T. only Rev. 15:18f. and Luke 6:44. 
The clusters (tous botruas). Old word dotrus, here only in 
N.T. (Gen. 40:10). Her grapes (hai staphulai autés). Old 
word again for grapes, bunch of grapes, in N.T. only here, 
Matt. 7:16; Luke 6:44. re fully ripe (ékmasan). Old and 
common verb (from akmé, Matt. 15:16), to come to ma- 
turity, to reach its acme, here only in N.T. 

19. Cast (ebalen). As in verse 16. Gathered (etrugésen). 
Like etheristhé in verse 16, in obedience to the instructions 
in verse 18 (¢rugéson). The vintage of the earth (ten ampelon 
tés gés). ‘‘The vine of the earth.” Here ampelos is used 
for the enemies of Christ collectively pictured. And cast it 
(ebalen). Repeating ebalen and referring to ampelon (vin- 
tage) just before. Into the winepress the great winepress (eis 
tén lénon ton megan). Lénos is either feminine as in verse 


416 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


20 and 19:15, or masculine sometimes in ancient Greek. 
Here we have both genders, a solecism frequent in the 
Apocalypse (21:14 to teichos echon). See Matt. 21:33. For 
this metaphor of God’s wrath see 14:10; 15:1, 7; 16:1, 193 
19:15. 

20. Was trodden (epatethé). First aorist passive indicative 
of pated, to tread. The image of treading out the grapes is 
a familiar one in the East. Perhaps Is. 63:3 is in mind. 
Without the city (exdthen tés poleds). Ablative case with 
exothen (like exd). This was the usual place (Heb. 13:12). 
See exdthen in 11:2. Joel (3:12) pictures the vally of Jeho- 
shaphat as the place of the slaughter of God’s enemies. Cf. 
Zech. 14:4. Blood from the winepress (haima ek tés lénou). 
Bold imagery suggested by the colour of the grapes. Unto 
the bridles (achri ton chalinén). Old word (from chalad to 
slacken), in N.T. only here and James 3:3. Bold picture. 
As far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs (apo stadion 
chilion hexakosion). A peculiar use of apo, for “distance 
from (of)” as also in John 11:18; 21:8, somewhat like the 
use of pro in John 12:1. The distance itself covers the 
length of Palestine, but it is more likely that “‘the metaphor 
is worked out with the exuberance of apocalyptic symbol- 
ism” (Swete) for the whole earth. 


CHAPTER XV 


1. Another sign in heaven (allo sémeion en toi ourandi). 
Looking back to 12:1, 3, after the series intervening. The 
Seven Bowls are parallel with the Seven Seals (ch. 6) and 
the Seven Trumpets (chapters 8 to 11), but there is an even 
closer connection with chapters 12 to 14, “the drama of 
the long conflict between the church and the world” (Swete). 
Great and marvellous (mega kai thaumaston). Thaumastos 
is an old verbal adjective (from thaumazd, to wonder) and 
is already in Matt. 21:42. The wonder extends to the end 
of this vision or sign (16:21). Seven angels (aggelous hepta). 
Accusative case in apposition with sémeion after eidon. Cf. 
8:2. Which are the last (tas eschatas). “Seven plagues the 
last.” As in 21:9, “the final cycle of such visitations” 
(Swete). Js finished (etelesth@). Proleptic prophetic first 
aorist passive indicative of fe/ed as in 10:7. The number 
seven seems particularly appropriate here for finality and 
completeness. 

2. As it were a glassy sea (hos thalassan hualinen). Ac- 
cusative case after eidon and hos here, not in 4:6, which see 
for the symbol. Mingled with fire (memigmenén puri). Per- 
fect passive participle of mignumi, to mix, and the associa- 
tive instrumental case puri. This item not in 4:6 (a vision 
of peace), but here it adds to the splendour of the vision. 
This parenthesis (2 to 4) gives a picture of the martyrs in 
their state of bliss. Them that come off victorious (tous 
nikontas). Present active articular participle of nikad, ac- 
cusative after eidon, ‘‘those that come off victorious” (14:4). 
From the beast and from his image (ek tou theriou kai ek tés 
eikonos autou). ‘This use of ek after ikad is unusual, also 
with ek tou arithmou. For these items see 13:1, 14, 173 

417 


418 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


14:9, 11; 19:20; 20:4. By the glassy sea (epi tén thalassan 
ten hualinén). Or “upon” more likely (4:6) with the ac- 
cusative as in Matt. 14:25ff. Harps of God (kitharas tou 
theou). Objective genitive, for the worship of God (5:8; 
r420%.1¢Chron: 16.42), 

3. The song of Moses (tén cidén tou Mouseds). Ex. 14:31; 
15:1-19. A song of victory like that of Moses after crossing 
the Red Sea. And the song of the Lamb (tén didén tou arniou). 
A separate note of victory like that of Moses, though one 
song, not two. Charles finds it impossible to reconcile the 
two expressions, if genuine, but it is a needless objection. 
The words come from the O.T.: “great” (megala) from Ps. 
111:2, “wonderful” (¢haumasta) from Ps. 139:14, ““O Lord 
God the Almighty” (Kurie ho theos ho pantokrator) from 
Amos 4:13 (Rev. 4:8), “righteous and true” (dikaiai kai 
aléthinai) from Deut. 32:4, “Thou King of the ages” (ho 
basileus ton aidnon) like Jer. 10:10 and I Tim. 1:17. Some 
MSS. have “the king of the saints” and some “the king 
of the nations,” like Jer. 10:7. John thus combines in 
Hebraic tone the expressions of the old and the new in the 
song to the Glorified Messiah. 

4. Who shall not fear? (tis ou mé phobéthéi;). Rhetorical 
question with ou mé (double negative) and first aorist pas- 
sive subjunctive of phobeomai (future passive in Jer. 10:7). 
And glorify (kai doxasei). Change here to the future in- 
dicative instead of the aorist subjunctive, as often. Cf. © 
Ps. 86:9. Thou only art holy (monos hosios). Both predicate 
adjectives, “Thou art alone holy.” God alone is perfectly 
holy (16:5). Shall come (héxousin). . Future active of héko. 
And worship (kai proskunésousin). Future active of pros- 
kuneod. Both from Ps. 86:9. Have been made manifest 
(ephanerothésan). Prophetic first aorist passive indicative 
of phanerod. This martyr’s song has the ring of great 
poetry. 

5. The temple of the tabernacle of the testimony (ho naos 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 419 


tes skénés tou marturiou). Charles calls this “strange” lan- 
guage. Probably the tabernacle or tent of witness (Numb. 
9:15; 17:7) is in mind and the tent of meeting (Ex. 27:21) 
rather than the temple in Jerusalem. Was opened (énoigé'. 
Second aorist passive indicative of anoigd as in 11:19. For 
NGOS SCC 32125 7:153 14215, 173 1621, 17. 

6. There came out (exélthan). Second aorist active indica 
tive of exerchomai with -an rather than -on. Proleptic and 
prophetic aorist. The seven angels (hoi hepta aggeloi). Those 
in verse 1. The seven plagues (tas hepta plégas). The bowls 
are not given them till verse 7. Arrayed (endedumenoi). 
Perfect passive participle of endud. With precious stone pure 
and bright (lithon katharon lampron). Accusative case re- 
tained with verb of clothing as so often, literally “with a 
stone pure bright.” For both adjectives together see 19:8, 
14. Some MSS. read /inon (linen). For lithon see 17:4; 
18:16; Ezek. 28:13. Girt (periezdsmenoi). Perfect passive 
participle of perizinnud. See 1:13 for both participles. For 
stéthos (breast) see Luke 18:13. With golden girdles (zonas 
chrusas). Accusative case after the perfect passive par- 
ticiple periezosmenoi as in 1:13. 

7. Seven golden bowls (hepta phialas chrusas). Golden 
saucers, but not full of incense as in 5:8, but “full (gemousas 
for which see 5:8) of the wrath of God who liveth for eves 
and ever” (tou thumou tou theou tou zontos eis tous aionas 
ton aionon). Portents of dreadful events. 

8. Was filled with smoke (egemisthé kapnou). First aorist 
passive indicative of gemizd (from gemé), to fill full, and 
with the genitive kapnou (smoke). Smoke is here the sym- 
bol of God’s presence (Ex. 19:18; Is. 6:5). Till should be 
finished (achri telesthisin). ‘Temporal clause for future time 
with achri (equal to Aeds in import) and the first aorist 
passive subjunctive of te/ed, a metaphorical and symbolic 
“smoke screen” to keep all out of the sanctuary for the 
time being. 


CHAPTER XVI 


1. A great voice (megalés phonés). Not an angel as in 
$325 7:23 10:3; 14:7, 9, 15, 18, but of God as 15:8 shows, 
since no one could enter the naos. Pour out (ekcheete). 
Second aorist active imperative of ekched (same form as 
present active imperative). Blass would change to ekcheate 
(clearly aorist) as in verse 6. The seven bowls (tas hepta 
phialas). The article points to verse 7. 

2. Went and poured out (apélthen kai execheen). Second 
aorist active indicative of aperchomai (redundant use like 
hupagete with ekcheete, ““go and pour out,” in verse 1) and 
of ekched. Each angel “went off” to perform his task. 
For execheen see it repeated in verses 3, 4, 8, 10, 12,17. Into 
the earth (eis ten gen). This same use of eis after execheen 
in verses 3, 4. It became (egeneto). ‘There came” (second 
aorist middle indicative of ginomai). A noisome and griev- 
ous sore (helkos kakon kai ponéron). “Bad and malignant 
sore.” felkos is old word for a suppurated wound (Latin 
ulcus), here, verse 11, and Luke 16:21. See the sixth Egyp- 
tian plague (Ex. 9:10; Deut. 28:27, 35) and Job 2:7. The 
magicians were attacked in Egypt and the worshippers. of 
Ceesar here (13:17; 14:9, 11; 19:20). 

3- Into the sea (eis ten thalassan). Like the first Egyptian 
plague (Ex. 7:12-41) though only the Nile affected then. 
Blood as of a dead man (haima hos nekrou). At the trumpet 
(8:11) the water becomes wormwood. Here Ads nekrou is 
added to Ex. 7:19, “the picture of a murdered man welter- 
ing in his blood” (Swete). “Coagulated blood, fatal to 
animal life” (Moffatt). Every living soul (pasa psuché xdés). 
“Every soul of life” (Hebraism, Gen. 1:21, marked by life). 
Even the things that were in the sea (ta en t#i thalass#i). “The 

420 , 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 421 


’ 


things in the sea,” in apposition with psuché. Complete 
destruction, not partial as in 8:9. 

4. Into the rivers and the fountains of waters (eis tous 
potamous kai tas péegas ton hudaton). See 8:10 for this phrase. 
Contamination of the fresh-water supply by blood follows 
that of the sea. Complete again. 

5. The angel of the waters (tou aggelou ton hudaton). Geni- 
tive case object of @kousa. See 7:1 for the four angels in 
control of the winds and 14:18 for the angel with power over 
fire. The rabbis spoke also of an angel with power over the 
earth and another over the sea. Which art and which wast 
(ho On kai ho én). See this peculiar idiom for God’s eternity ~ 
with ho as relative before én” in 1:4, 8; 4:8, but without ho 
erchomenos (the coming on, the one who is to be) there for 
the future as in 11:17. Thou Holy One (ho hosios). Nom- 
inative form, but vocative case, as often. Note both dikaios 
and hosios applied to God as in 3:1 and 15:3f. Because 
thou didst thus judge (hott tauta ekrinas). Reason for calling 
God dikaios and hosios. The punishment on the waters is 
deserved. First aorist active indicative of krind, to judge. 

6. For (hoti). Second causal conjunction (Aoti) explana- 
tory of the first Aoti, like the two cases of Aoti in 15:4. They 
poured out (exechean). Second aorist active indicative of 
ekcheo with -an instead of -on. Blood hast thou given them 
to drink (haima autois dedokas pein). Haima (blood) is 
the emphatic word, measure for measure for shedding the 
blood of saints and prophets (11:18; 18:24). Perfect active 
indicative of diddmi, and so a permanent and just punish- 
ment. Pein is the abbreviated second aorist active infini- 
tive of pind for piein (epion). It is the epexegetical infini- 
tive after dedokas. There was no more drinking-water, but 
only this coagulated blood. They are worthy (axioi eisin). 
“Terrible antithesis” (Swete) to 3:4. The asyndeton adds 
to it (Alford). 

7. O Lord God, the Almighty (Kurie ho theos ho pantokrator). 


422 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Just as in 15:3 in the Song of Moses and of the Lamb, 
vocative with the article ho. “Judgments” (kriseis) here 
instead of “ways” (hodoi) there, and with the order of the 
adjectives reversed (aléthinai kai dikaiai, true and righteous). 

8. Upon the sun (epi ton hélion). Not eis (into) as in 
verses 2, 3, 4. The fourth trumpet (8:12) affected a third 
of the sun, moon, and stars with a plague of darkness, but 
here it is a plague of extreme heat. To scorch with fire 
(kaumatisai en puri). First aorist active infinitive of kau- 
matizo, late (Plutarch, Epictetus) causative verb (from 
kauma, heat), in N.T. only here and verse 9, Matt. 1 3:6; 
Mark 4:6. The addition of en puri (in fire, with fire) in- 
tensifies the picture. 

9. Were scorched (ekaumatisthésan). First aorist passive 
indicative of same verb. With great heat (kauma mega). 
Cognate accusative retained with the passive verb. Old 
word (from kaid to burn), in N.T. only 7:16 and here. For 
blaspheming the name of God see 13:6; James 2:7; Rom. 
2:24; I Tim. 6:1. They blamed God for the plagues. They 
repented not (ou metenoésan). This solemn negative aorist 
of metanoed is a refrain like a funeral dirge (9:20f.; 16:11). 
In 11:13 some did repent because of the earthquake. Even 
deserved punishment may harden the heart. To give him 
glory (dounai autoi doxan). Second aorist active infinitive 
of didomi, almost result. For the phrase see 11:13; 14:7; 
19:7. 

10. Upon the throne of the beast (epi ton thronon iou 
theriou). ‘That is Rome (13:2). The dragon gave the beast 
his throne (2:13). Was darkened (egeneto eskotomené). Peri- 
phrastic past perfect passive with ginomai and skotoa (9:2). 
Like the darkness of the Egyptian plague (Ex. 10:22) and 
worse, for the effects of the previous plagues continue. 
They gnawed their tongues (emasonto tas glossas auton). Im- 
perfect middle of masaomai, old verb (to chew), from maa 
(to knead), only here in N.T. For pain (ek tou ponon). 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 423 


“Out of distress” (cf. ek in 8:13), rare sense of old word 
(from penomai to work for one’s living), in N.T. only here, 
ania? Colig 197° See: Matt. '8:12. 

11. They blasphemed (eblasphemésan) and they repented not 
(kai ou metenoésan): Precisely as in verse 9, which see. 
Not just because of the supernatural darkness, but also 
“because of their pains” (ek ton pondn auton, plural here 
and same use of ek) and their sores (kai ek ton helkin auton, 
as in verse 2, only plural, and same use of ek). Of their 
works (ek ton ergon auton). “Out of their deeds,” and ad- 
dition to verse 9. The God of heaven (ton theon tou ouranou). 
As in Dan. 2:44. Like the pride of Nebuchadrezzar against 
Jehovah. 

12. Upon the great river, the river Euphrates (epi ton 
potamon ton megan ton Euphratén). The sixth trumpet 
brings up the river Euphrates also (9:14), only there eps 
with the locative, while here epi with the accusative. Note 
triple use of the article ton here. Was dried up (exéranthé). 
First aorist (prophetic) passive of xéraind (14:15). Cf. 
Zech. 10:11. That may be made ready (hina hetoimasthéi). 
Purpose clause with Aina and the first aorist passive of 
hetoimazo. Common verb in Rev. (8:6; 9:7, 15; 12:6; 19:7; 
21:2). The way for the kings (hé hodos ton basiledn). Objec- 
tive genitive dasiledn. That come from the sunrising (ton 
apo anatolés héliou). “Those from the rising of the sun,” 
the kings from the east (cf. Matt. 2:2) in their march against 
Rome. Parthia in particular resisted Rome before Trajan’s 
day. 

i Coming out of (ek alone, no participle erchomena). 
Of the dragon (tou drakontos). That is Satan (12:3, 9). Of 
the beast (tou thériou). The first beast (13:1, 12) and then 
just “the beast” (13:14ff.; 14:9, 11; 15:2; 16:2, 10), “the 
brute force of the World-power represented by the Roman 
Empire” (Swete). Of the false prophet (tou pseudoprophétou). 
Cf. Matt. 7:15; Acts 13:6; I John 2:22; 4:3; II John 7. 


424 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Identified with the second beast (13:11-14) in 19:20; 20:10. 
So the sixth bowl introduces the dragon and his two sub- 
alterns of chapters 12 and 13 (the two beasts). Three un- 
clean spirits (pneumata tria akatharta). Out of the mouths 
of each of the three evil powers (the dragon and the two 
beasts) comes an evil spirit. See the use of mouth in 1:16 
(g:17f.; 11:5; 12:15; 19:15, 21) as a chief seat of influence. 
In II Thess. 2:8 we have ‘“‘the breath of his mouth” (the 
other sense of pneuma). For akatharton (unclean) with 
pneuma see Mark 1:23f.; 3:115 5:2ff.; Acts 5:16; 8:7. “Christ 
expelled unclean spirits, but His enemies send them forth” 
(Swete). See Zech. 13:2 “the false prophets and the un- 
clean spirits.” 4s it were frogs (his batrachoi). Cf. Ex. 
8:5; Lev. 11:10ff. Old word, here alone in N.T. Like 
loathsome frogs in form. 

14. Spirits of devils (pneumata daimonion). “Spirits of 
demons.” Explanation of the simile Ads batrachoi. See I 
Tim. 4:1 about “deceiving spirits and teachings of demons.” 
Working signs (poiounta sémeia). ‘Doing signs” (present 
active participle of poied). The Egyptian magicians wrought 
“signs” (tricks), as did Simon Magus and later Apollonius 
of Tyana. Houdini claimed that he could reproduce every 
trick of the spiritualistic mediums. Which go forth (ha 
ekporeuetai). Singular verb with neuter plural (collective) 
subject. Unto the kings (epi tous basileis). The three evil 
spirits (dragon and the two beasts) spur on the kings of the ~ 
whole world to a real world war. “There have been times 
when nations have been seized by a passion for war which 
the historian can but imperfectly explain” (Swete). To 
gather them together (sunagagein). Second aorist active in- 
finitive of sunagd, to express purpose (that of the unclean 
spirits). Unto the war of the great day of God, the Almighty 
(eis ton polemon tés hémeras tes megalés tou theou tou panto- 
kratoros). Some take this to be war between nations, like 
Mark 13:8, but it is more likely war against God (Ps. 2:2) 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 425 


and probably the battle pictured in 17:14 and 19:19. Cf. 
II Pet. 3:12, “the day of God,” his reckoning with the na- 
tions. See Joel 2:11; 3:4. -Paul uses “‘that day” for the 
day of the Lord Jesus (the Parousia) as in I Thess. 5:2; 
[ivPhessien:t0;9030; 1 Corier:8311[:Cors 1:14; Phil. 1:6; 2216; 
II Tim. 1:12, 18; 4:8. 

15. Behold, I come as a thief (idou erchomai hos kleptes). 
The voice of Christ breaks in with the same metaphor as 
in 3:3, which see. There comes one of seven beatitudes in 
Rey. (1:3; 14:13; 16:15; 19:9; 20:6; 22:7, 14). For grégoron 
(watching) see 3:2, and for séron (keeping), 1:3. Lest he 
walk naked (hina mé gumnos peripatéi). Negative purpose: 
clause with hina mé and the present active subjunctive of 
peripated, and note predicate nominative gumnos (naked). 
And they see his shame (kai bleposin tén aschemosunén autou). 
Continuation of the final clause with present active sub- 
junctive of blepd. Aschémosunén is old word (from aschémon, 
indecent, I Cor. 12:23), in N.T. only here and Rom. 1:27, 
a euphemism for sén aischunéen (Rev. 3:18). 

16. They gathered (sunégagen). Second aorist active in- 
dicative of sunagd, singular (the three unclean spirits), like 
ekporeuetai in verse 14. Har-Magedon (Har-Magedon). John 
proceeds now after the interruption in verse 15. Perhaps 
“the mountains of Megiddo” though not certain. Megiddo 
is in the valley of Esdraelon, and by the waters of Megiddo 
(the Kishon) Israel gained a decisive victory over Sisera 
(Judges 5:19), celebrated in Deborah’s song. See also Rev. 
20:8ff. and Ezek. 39:2, 4. 

17. Upon the air (epi ton aera). All men breathe the air 
and this is worse than the smiting of the earth (verse 2), 
the sea (3), the fresh waters (4), the sun (8). 4 great voice 
(phoné megalé). The voice of God as in 16:1. I¢ is done 
(Gegonen). Perfect active indicative of ginomai. Like 
Gegonan in 21:6. The whole series of plagues is now com- 
plete. 


426 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


18. And there were (kai egenonto). “And there came” 
(same verb ginomai). See 8:5; 11:19 for this list of terrible 
sounds and lightnings, and for the great earthquake (seismos 
megas) see 6:12; 11:13 (cf. Luke 21:11). Such as was not 
(hoios ouk egeneto). Qualitative relative with ginomai again, 
“such as came not.” Since there were men (aph’ hou an- 
thropoi egenonto). “Since which time (chronou understood) 
men came.” So great an earthquake, so mighty (télikoutos 
seismos houto megas). Quantitative correlative télikoutos 
rather than the qualitative toioutos, to correspond with 
hoios (not hosos). And then houtd megas repeats (redundant) 
telikoutos. Cf. Mark 13:19 for hoia—toiaut@ about like 
tribulation (thlipsis). 

19. Was divided into three parts (egeneto eis tria meré). 
“Came into three parts” (gizomai again). In 11:3 a tenth 
part of the city fell. Babylon (Rome) is meant (17:18). 
Fell (epesan). Second aorist active indicative of pipta (-an 
form in place of -on). Was remembered (emnésthé). First 
aorist (prophetic) passive indicative of mimnéskd. Babylon 
(Rome) had not been overlooked. God was simply biding 
his time with Rome. To give unto her (dounai autét). 
Second aorist active infinitive of diddmi, epexegetic use as 
in 11:18; 16:9. The cup of the wine of the fierceness of his 
wrath (to potérion tou oinou tou thumou tés orgés autou). 
“The cup of the wine of the wrath of his anger,” using both 
thumos (boiling rage) and orgé (settled anger). See both in 
Jer. 37 (30): 24. ) 

20. Filed (ephugen). Second aorist active indicative of 
pheugo. Islands sometimes sink in the sea in earthquakes 
(6:14). Were not found (ouch heurethésan). . First aorist 
passive indicative of heuriskd. See 20:11 for the same idea. 

21. Hail (chalaza). As in 8:17; 11:19. Every stone about 
the weight of a talent (hos talantiaia). Old adjective (from 
talanton), here only in N.T., but in Polybius and Josephus. 
See Ex. 9:24 for the great hail in Egypt and also Josh. 10:11; 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 427 
Is. 28:2; Ezek. 38:22 for hail as the symbol of God’s wrath. 
In the LXX a ¢alanton ranged in weight from 108 to 130 
pounds. Because of the plague of hail (ek tes plégés tes 
chalazes). “As a result of the plague of hail.” This punish- 
ment had the same effect as in verses 9 and 11. Exceeding 
great (Megale—sphrodra). Emphatic positions at ends of 
the clause (great—exceedingly). 


CHAPTER XVII 


1. I will show thee (deixé soi). Future active of deiknumi. 
It is fitting that one of the seven angels that had the seven 
bowls should explain the judgment on Babylon (16:19) al- 
ready pronounced (14:8). That is now done in chapters 
17 and 18. The judgment of the great harlot (to krima tés 
pornés tés megalés). The word krima is the one used about 
the doom of Babylon in Jer. 28(51):9. Already in 14:8 
Babylon is called the harlot. Pornés is the objective geni- 
tive, “the judgment on the great harlot.” That sitteth upon 
many waters (tes kathémenés epi hudaton pollon). Note triple 
use of the article /és. In Jer. 28(51):13 we have eph’ hudasi 
pollois (locative in piace of genitive as here). Babylon got 
its wealth by means of the Euphrates and the numerous 
canals for irrigation. Rome does not have such a system 
of canals, but this item is taken and applied to the New 
Babylon in 17:15. Nahum (3:4) calls Nineveh a harlot, 
as Isaiah (23:16f.) does Tyre. 

2. The kings of the earth (hoi basileis tés gés). Repeated 
in 1:5; 6:15; 17:18; 18:3, 9; 19:19; 21:24 and “the kings 
of the inhabited earth” (16:14) either for human rulers in 
general or the vassal kings absorbed by the Roman Empire. 
Committed fornication (eporneusan). First aorist active in- 
dicative of porneud. “In purchasing the favour of Rome 
by accepting her suzerainty and with it her vices and idola- 
tries” (Swete). Were made drunken (emethusthésan). First 
aorist passive indicative of methuskd, old verb (from methu), 
as in Luke 12:45, here only in the Apocalypse. Cf. Is. 
51:7 and pepotiken in Rev. 14:8. See 18:3. 

3. He carried me away (apénegken me). Second aorist ac- 
tive indicative of apopherd, to bear away, prophetic aorist. 

428 ; 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 429 


This verb is used of angels at death (Luke 16:22) or in an 
ecstasy (Rev. 21:10 and here). In the Spirit (en pneumati). 
Probably his own spirit, though the Holy Spirit is possible 
(1:10; 4:2; 21:10), without Paul’s uncertainty (II Cor. 12:2). 
Cf. Ezek. 3:14f.; 8:3; 11:24. Into a wilderness (eis erémon). 
In Is. 21 there is to horama tés eremou (the vision of the 
deserted one, Babylon), and in Is. 14:23 Babylon is called 
eremon. John may here picture this to be the fate of Rome 
or it may be that he himself, in the wilderness (desert) this 
side of Babylon, sees her fate. In 21:10 he sees the New 
Jerusalem from a high mountain. Sitting (kathémenén). 
Present middle participle of kath@mai as in verse 1. “To. 
manage and guide the beast” (Vincent). Upon a scarlet- 
coloured beast (epi therion kokkinon). Accusative with epi 
here, though genitive in verse 1. Late adjective (from 
kokkos, a parasite of the ilex coccifera), a crimson tint for 
splendour, in Rev. 17:3, 4; 18:12, 16 and Matt. 27:28; Heb. 
g:19. Full of names of blasphemy (gemonta onomata blas- 
phemias). See 13:1 for “names of blasphemy” on the seven 
heads of the beast, but here they cover the whole body of 
the beast (the first beast of 13:1; 19:20). The harlot city 
(Rome) sits astride this beast with seven heads and ten 
horns (Roman world power). The beast is here personified 
with masculine participles instead of neuter, like thérion 
(gemonta accusative singular, echon nominative singular, 
though some MSS. read echonta), construction according 
to sense in both instances. The verb gemé always has the 
genitive after it in the Apocalypse (4:6, 8; 5:8; 15:73 17:45 
21:9) save here and apparently once in 17:4. 

4. Was arrayed (én peribeblémené). Periphrastic past per- 
fect indicative of periballd, to fling round one. In purple 
and scarlet (porphuroun kai kokkinon). Accusative retained 
after this passive verb of clothing, as so often. Porphurous 
is old adjective for purple (from porphura), in N.T. only 
here and John 19:2, 5. See preceding verse for kokkinos. 


430 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Decked (kechrusoOmené). Perfect passive participle of chrusod, 
old verb, to gild, to adorn with gold, here alone in N.T. 
With gold and precious stone and pearls (chrusioi kai lithoi 
timioi kai margaritais). Instrumental case. Chrusidi is 
cognate with the participle. Lithdi timidi is collective 
(18:12, 16; 21:19). There is a zeugma also with margaritais 
(18:12, 16; 21:21), for which word see Matt. 7:6. Probably 
John is thinking of the finery of the temple prostitutes in 
Asia Minor. Full of abominations (gemon bdelugmatin). 
Agreeing with potérion, “cup” (neuter singular accusative). 
Some MSS. read gemén (nominative masculine like echon 
in verse 3, quite irregular). For ddelugmaton (genitive after 
gemon) see Matt. 24:15; (Mark 13:14), common in the LXX 
for idol worship and its defilements (from ddelussd, to render 
foul), both ceremonial and moral. See Jer. 15:7. Even the 
unclean things of her fornication (kai ta akatharta tés porneias 
auiés). Hither the accusative after gemon as in verse 3 
(and full of the unclean things of her fornication) or the 
object of echousa, like potérion. 

5. Upon her forehead a name written (epi to metipon autes 
onoma gegrammenon). Roman harlots wore a label with 
their names on their brows (Seneca, Rhet. I. 2. 7; Juvenal 
VI. 122f.), and so here. In 19:16 Christ has a name on 
his garments and on his thigh, while in 14:1 and 22:4 the 
redeemed have the name of God on their foreheads. There 
is undoubtedly a contrast between this woman here and . 
the woman in chapter 12. Mystery (mustérion). Either in 
apposition with onoma or as part of the inscription on her 
forehead. In either case the meaning is the same, that the 
name Babylon is to be interpreted miystically or spiritually 
(cf. pneumatikos 11:8) for Rome. The Mother of the Harlots 
and of the Abominations of the Earth (H@ Métér ton Pornén 
kai ton Bdelugmaton tés Gés). The Metropolis of the Em- 
pire is the mother of harlotry and of the world’s idolatries. 
Charles quotes Tacitus (4mm. XV. 44) about Rome as the 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 431 


c 


city “guo cuncta undique atrocia aut pudenda confluunt 
celebranturque.” 

6. Drunken with the blood of the saints (methuousan ek 
tou haimatos ton hagion). Present active feminine accusa- 
tive singular participle of methud, old verb, to be drunk 
(Matt. 24:49). Of the martyrs of Fesus (ton marturon Tésou). 
“Witnesses” (2:13) for Jesus (objective genitive) unto blood 
(16:6; 18:24) and so martyrs in the modern sense of the 
word. “Drunk with blood” is a common idea with the 
ancients (Euripides, Josephus, Philo, Cicero, Pliny). With 
@ great wonder (thauma mega). Cognate accusative with 
ethaumasa. 

7. I will tell thee the mystery (eg6 ero soi to mustérion). 
The angel gives his interpretation of the woman and the 
beast (17:7-18). ré is the future active of eipon (defec- 
tive verb), to tell, to say. 

8. Was and is not (én kai ouk estin). Imperfect and present 
of eimi, an apparent antithesis to ho én kai ho on of 1:4. 
This is a picture of the beast of 13:1ff. which the woman is 
riding, but no longer just the empire, but one of the empe- 
rors who died (ouk estin, is not). And is about to come up out 
of the abyss (kai mellei anabainein ek tes abussou). That is, 
he is going to come to life again. nd to go into perdition 
(kai eis apoleian hupagei). So (and he goes into perdition) 
the best MSS. read rather than the infinitive Aupagein. 
Most interpreters see here an allusion to the “‘Nero redi- 
vivus” expectancy realized in Domitian, who was ruling 
when John wrote and who was called Nero redivivus. Shall 
wonder (thaumasthésontai). First future passive (deponent) 
of thaumazo, with which compare ethaumasthé in 13:3. John 
had wondered (ethaumasa) in verse 6 “with the amazement 
of a horrible surprise; the world will wonder and admire” 
(Swete). Whose name (hon onoma). Singular onoma, like 
ptoma in 11:8. See 13:8 for the same description of those 
who worship the beast and for discussion of details. When 


432 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


they behold (bleponton). Genitive plural of the present active 
participle of d/epd, agreeing with hon (genitive relative) 
rather than with hoi katoikountes (nominative just before 
hon). How that (hoti). “Namely that.” He was, and is not, 
and shall come (én kai ouk estin kai parestai). Repetition 
of what is in verse 7 with parestai (future of pareimi, from 
which parousia comes) in place of mellei, “parody of the 
divine name” (Charles) in 1:4, 8; 4:8, “as the hellish anti- 
type of Christ.”” The Neronic Antichrist has also a parousia. 

9. Here is the mind which hath wisdom (Hode ho nous ho 
echon sophian). “Here is the intelligence which has wisdom” 
(Charles). A variation of 13:18, but the same idea. Seven 
mountains (hepta oré). Rome was known as the city on 
seven hills (Vergil, Horace, Ovid, Cicero, etc.). On which 
(hopou—ep’ auton). ‘‘Where—upon them.” Pleonasm like 
hopou—ekei in 12:6. In 13:1ff. it is the beast that has the 
seven heads, while here the woman riding the beast has 
seven heads, a slight change in the symbolism, and the 
heads. are further identified as kings. 

10. Seven kings (basileis hepta). This is another change 
in the symbolism. The identification of these seven kings 
is one of the puzzles of the book. The five are fallen (hoi 
pente epesan). Second aorist active indicative of piptd with 
the -an ending. Common for the downfall of kings (Ezek. 
29:5; 30:6; Is. 21:9, etc.). See II Sam. 3:38. The one is 
(ho heis estin). The one when this vision is dated. The. 
other is not yet come (ho allos oupé élthen). Prophetic second 
aorist active of erchomai. Charles takes this as the date of 
this “‘source” or part of the Apocalypse. But John could 
himself have used this language in the time of Domitian 
even if he was the one who had not yet come. The difficulty 
about counting these emperors is that Galba, Otho, Vitellius 
reigned so briefly that they hardly merit being included. 
When he cometh (hotan elthéi). Indefinite temporal clause 
for the future, with Aotan and the second aorist active sub- 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 433 


junctive of erchomai, “whenever he comes.” He must con- 
tinue a little while (oligon auton dei meinai). Swete takes this 
to be Titus, who died September 13, 81, after a short reign. 

11. Ls himself also an eighth and is of the seven (kai autos 
ogdoos kai ek ton hepta). This is the angel’s interpretation 
and it looks like a reference to Domitian as the eighth, whe 
is regarded as one of the seven because he was considered a 
second Nero (Nero redivivus). For ek tin hepta see Acts 21:8. 
John may have used ek ¢dn instead of heis ek tin to avoid 
absolute identity between Domitian and Nero (Beckwith). 
And he goeth unto perdition (kai eis apoleian hupagei). As 
in verse 8. “Domitian was assassinated (September 18, 96), - 
after a terrible struggle with his murderers. The tyrant’s 
end was a symbol of the end to which the Beast which he 
personated was hastening” (Swete). Cf. 19:11-21. 

12. Which have received no kingdom as yet (hoitines basi- 
leian oupod elabon). Second aorist (proleptic and prophetic) 
active indicative of Jamband. The heads are emperors and 
the horns are kings (both called dasileis). As kings (hos 
basileis). Compared to kings (see Ads in 1:10; 4:63 9:73 13:33 
14:3; 16:21) without identification with the emperors, though 
succeeding them with ‘“‘quasi-imperial powers” with the 
beast. For one hour (mian horan). Accusative of extent of 
time, and that a brief time (18:10, 16, 19) in comparison 
with the beast (13:2). 

13. Have one mind (mian gnomén echousin). ‘‘One pur- 
pose” (gnomé from gindsko) as in Acts 20:3 and I Cor. 1:10. 
The new powers are allies of the beast. They give their power 
and authority unto the beast (ten dunamin kai ten exousian 
auton toi théridi didoasin). Present active indicative of 
didomi. Just as the dragon gave both power and authority 
to the beast (13:2), so they are wholly at the service of the 
beast. 

14. These (houtoi). These ten kings. Shall war against 
the Lamb (meta tou thériou polemésousin). Future active of 


434 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


polemeo, to war. As allies of the beast (the servant of the 
dragon, 12:7) they will wage war with the Lamb (the enemy 
of the dragon). These kings gather for battle as in 16:13f. 
And the Lamb shall overcome them (kai to arnion nikéset 
autous). Future active of nikad. This is the glorious out- 
come, victory by the Lamb over the coalition of kings as 
against the beast before. For he is Lord of lords and King 
of kings (hoti Kurios kurion estin kai Basileus basileon). 
The same words are again descriptive of Christ in 19:16, 
as of God in Deut. 10:17 (God of gods and Lord of lords) 
and Dan. 10:17 (God of gods and Lord of kings). Cf. also 
I Tim. 6:15 and Rev. 1:5. Crowned heads are Christ’s 
subjects. And they also shall overcome that are with him 
(kai hoi met’ autou). ‘And those with him shall also over- 
come” (supply nikésousin, not eisin). They will share in 
the triumph of the Lamb, as they shared in the conflict. 
Cf. meta tou thériou in verse 12. Called and chosen and faith- 
ful (klétoi kai eklektoi kai pistoi). ‘These are the three notes 
of those who share in the victory. For k/étos and eklektos 
see Matt. 22:14 (contrasted); Rom. 8:28ff.; II Pet. 1:10; 
Rev. 2:10, 13. The elect are called and prove faithful. 

15. Where the harlot sitteth (hou hé pornos kathétai). Rela- 
tive adverb hou (where) referring to the waters (Audata) of 
verse 1 on which the harlot sits. Present middle indicative 
of kathémai. Are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and 
tongues (laoi kai ochloi eisin kai ethné kai glossai). The 
O.T. uses “waters” as symbol for “peoples”’ (Is. 8:7; Jer. 
47:2; Ps. 29:10, etc.). “Rome’s greatest danger lay in the 
multitudes which were under her sway” (Swete). 

16. These shall hate the harlot (houtoi misésousin tén por- 
nén). Future active of mised. Houtoi is resumptive dem- 
onstrative pronoun (masculine) referring to the ten horns 
and the beast (neuter); construction according to sense. 
The downfall of Rome will come from the sudden change 
in subject peoples. Shall make her desolate and naked 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 435 


(2rémomenén poiesousin autén kai gumnén). Future active 
of poied and perfect passive predicate accusative participle 
of erémod, old verb (from erémos desolate), again in 18:16, 
19. Gumnén (naked) is predicate adjective. Shall eat her 
flesh (tas sarkas autés phagontai). Future middle of the de- 
fective verb esthid, to eat. Note plural sarkas, portions of 
flesh (James 5:3) as in Ps. 27:2 and Mic. 3:3. Shall burn 
her utterly with fire (autén katakausousin en puri). Future 
active of katakaid, to burn down (perfective use of aid). 
John wrote before the days of Alaric, Genseric, Ricimer, 
Totila, with their hordes which devastated Rome and the 


west in the fifth and sixth centuries. ‘‘No reader of the © 


Decline and Fall can be at a loss for materials which will 
at once illustrate and justify the general trend of St. John’s 
prophecy” (Swete). 

17. Did put (edoken). “Did give” (first aorist active of 
didomi. To do his mind (poiésai tén gnomén autou). Ep- 
exegetic first aorist active infinitive of poied after eddken, as 
often in this book. They are of one mind (verse 13) be- 
cause God put them up to it, clear statement of God’s over- 
ruling hand among the nations. Until the words of God should 
be accomplished (achri telesthesontai hoi logot tou theou). 
Temporal clause about the future with achri (like heos), 
with the future indicative of ¢e/ed, but with aorist passive 
subjunctive ¢elesthdsin in 15:8. For teled see also 10:7. For 
“the words of God”’ see 19:9. They will be fulfilled. 

18. The woman (hé gunz). She is now explained after 
the beast has been interpreted. Verse g made it plain 
enough, but this verse demonstrates that the woman is the 
city of Rome “which reigneth (hé echousa basileian, the one 
having a kingdom) over the kings of the earth (epi ton 
basilein tés gés).” Rome followed Babylon, and other cities 
may follow in their train. 


CHAPTER XVIII 


1. Coming down out of heaven (katabainonta ek tou ouranou). 
Present active predicate participle. Not the angel of 17:1, 
7, 15 (John’s guide), but one announcing the doom of Baby- 
lon (Rome). As in 10:1; 20:1. Was lightened (ephotisthé). 
First aorist passive of phdtizd, old causative verb (from 
phos, light), common in N.T. as in Rev. 18:1; 21:23; 22:5. 
With his glory (ek tés doxés autou). ‘By reason of (ek as in 
8:13; 16:10) his glory.” “So recently has he come from 
the Presence that in passing he flings a broad belt of light 
across the dark earth” (Swete). 

2. Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great (epesen, epesen Babu- 
lon hé megalé). The very words of 14:8: “Did fall, did fall 
Babylon the great.” Prophetic aorists of piptd repeated like 
a solemn dirge of the damned. Js become (egeneto). Pro- 
phetic aorist middle. 4 habitation of devils (katoikétérion). 
Late word (from katoiked, to dwell), in N.T. only here and 
Eph. 2:22. Devils should be demons, of course. So Isaiah 
prophesied of Babylon (12:21f.) and also Jeremiah (50:39) 
and Zephaniah of Nineveh (2:14). Both Babylon and Nine- 
veh are ruins. 4 hold of every unclean spirit (phulaké pantos 
pneumatos akathartou). Phulaké is garrison or watch-tower 
as in Hab. 2:1, rather than a prison (20:7). 2 hold of every 
unclean and hateful bird (phulaké pantos orneou akathartou 
kai memisémenou). Orneou is old word for bird, in N.T. 
only Rev. 18:2; 19:17, 21. ““The evil spirits, watching over 
fallen Rome like night-birds or harpies that wait for their 
prey, build their eyries in the broken towers which rise from 
the ashes of the city” (Swete). Long ago true of Babylon 
and Nineveh, some day to be true of Rome. 

3. By (ek). “As a result of.” Some MSS. omit ‘of the 

436 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 437 


wine” (fou oinou). Cf. 14:10; 16:10. Have fallen (peptokan). 
Perfect active third personal of pipfd for usual peptokasi. 
Some MSS. read pepdkan (have drunk), from pino like the 
metaphor in 14:8, 10; 16:19; 17:2. See 17:2 for the same 
charge about the kings of the earth. The merchants of the 
earth (hoi emporoi tés gés). Old word for one on a journey 
for trade (from en, poros), like drummers, in N.T. only 
Matt. 13:45; Rev. 18:3, 11, 15, 23. Like emporion (John 
2:16) and emporeuomai (James 4:13). Waxed rich (eplou: 
tesan). First ingressive aorist active indicative of plouted, 
to be rich (cf. 3:17). Here alone in the N.T. do we catch 
a glimpse of the vast traffic between east and west that made 
Rome rich. Of her wantonness (tou strénous autés). Late 
word for arrogance, luxury, here alone in N.T. See stréniaé 
in verses 7 and g, to live wantonly. 

4. Come forth, my people, out of her (exelthate, ho laos mou, 
ex autes). Second aorist (urgency) active imperative (-a 
form) of exerchomai. Like Is. 48:20; 52:11; Jer. 50:8; 51:6 
(about Babylon). See also the call of Abram (Gen. 12:1), 
the rescue of Lot (Gen. 19:12ff.). In the N.T. see Mark 
13:4; Il Cor. 6:14; Eph. 5:11; I Tim. 5:11. Ho Jaos is voca- 
tive with the form of the nominative. That ye have no 
Sellowship with her sins (hina mé sunkoinonéséte tais hamar- 
tais autés). Purpose clause with hina mé and the first aorist 
active subjunctive of sunkoindned, old compound (sun, to- 
gether, koindnos, partner), in N.T. only here, Phil. 4:14; 
Eph. 5:11. With associative instrumental case hamartiais. 
And that ye receive not of her plagues (kai ek ton plegon autés 
hina mé labéte). Another purpose clause dependent on the 
preceding, with hina mé and the second aorist active sub- 
junctive of /amband, and with proleptic emphatic position of 
ek ton plégon autes before hina mé. 

5. Have reached (ekolléthésan). First aorist passive (de- 
ponent) indicative of kollad, old verb (from kolla, gluten, 
glue), to cleave to, to join one another in a mass “up to 


438 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


heaven” (achri tou ouranou). Cf. Jer. 51:9; Zech. 14:5. 
Hath remembered (emnémoneusen). First aorist (prophetic) 
active indicative of mnémoneud, here with the accusative 
(adikémata, iniquities) instead of the genitive (Col. 4:18). 

6. Render as she rendered (apodote his apediken). Second 
aorist (effective) active imperative and first aorist (effective) 
active of apodidémi, old and common verb for requital, to 
give back, the /ex talionis which is in the O.T. (Jer. 50:15, 
29; 51:24, 56; Ps. 137:8), and in the N.T. also (Matt. 7:2). 
Here the reference is to persecutions by Rome, particularly 
the martyrdom of the saints (18:24; 19:2). Double the double 
(diplosate ta dipla). First aorist imperative of diplod, old 
verb (from diploos, double, Matt. 23:15), here only in N.T. 
Dipla is simply the neuter plural accusative (cognate) con- 
tract form for diploa (not diplo). Requite here in double 
measure, a ful] requital (Ex. 22:4, 7, 9; Is. 40:2; Jer. 16:18; 
17:18; Zech. 9:12). The double recompense was according 
to the Levitical law. Which she mingled (hoi ekerasen). 
First aorist active indicative of kerannumi. The relative 
hoi is attracted to the locative case of its antecedent poteri6i 
(cup), for which see 14:8, 10; 17:4; 18:3. Mingle unto her 
double (kerasate autéi diploun). First aorist active impera- 
tive of the same verb kerannumi, with the same idea of 
double punishment. 

7. How much soever (hosa). Indefinite quantitative rela- 
tive pronoun /osos in the accusative (cognate) neuter plural ° 
object of edoxasen (first aorist active indicative of doxaz0). 
Herself (hautén). Reflexive pronoun, accusative also with 
edoxasen. Waxed wanton (estréniasen). First aorist (ingres- 
sive) active indicative of stréniad (to live luxuriously), verb 
in late comedy instead of truphad (James 5:5), from strénos 
(Rev. 18:3), only here in N.T. So much give her of torment 
and mourning (tosouton dote autéi basanismon kai penthos). 
Second aorist active imperative of didomi, to give. The cor- 
relative pronoun fosouton is masculine singular accusative, 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 439 


agreeing with dasanismon, for which see 9:5 and 14:11, and 
is understood with the neuter word penthos (mourning), in 
N.T. only in James 4:9; Rev. 18:7ff.; 21:4 (kin to pathos, 
penomat). I sit a queen (kathémai basilissa). Predicate nom- 
inative for the old form basileia (dasilis), as in Matt. 12:42. 
Babylon and Tyre had preceded Rome in such boasting (Is. 
4777-9; Ezek. 27:3; 28:2; Zeph. 2:15). And am no widow 
(kai chéra ouk eimi). Feminine of the adjective chéros (bar- 
ren), old word (Mark 12:40). Shall in no wise see mourning 
(penthos ou mé ido). Confident boast of security with em- 
phatic position of penthos (see above) and double negative 
ou mé with the second aorist active subjunctive of horad 
(defective verb). 

8. Therefore (dia touto). Because of her presumption 
added to her crimes. In one day (en miai hémerai). Sym- 
bolical term for suddenness like midi hérai, in one hour 
(18:10, 16, 19). John has in mind still Is. 47:7-9. Shall 
come (hexousin). Future active of A2kd. Her plagues are 
named (death, mourning, famine). She shall be utterly 
burned (katakauthésetai). Future passive of katakaio (per- 
fective use of kata). With fire (en puri). “In fire,” as in 
17:16. Which judged her (ho krinas autén). Articular first 
aorist active participle of krind referring to kurios ho theos 
(the Lord God). The doom of Babylon is certain because 
of the power of God. 

g. Shall weep (klausousin). Future active of klaid, mid- 
dle k/ausontai in Attic, as in John 16:20. And wail over her 
(kai kopsontai ep’ autén). Future direct middle of kopto, 
old verb, to beat, to cut, middle to beat oneself (Rev. 1:7). 
For combination with k/aid as here see Luke 8:52. See 
17:2; 18:3, 7 for hoi porneusantes kai stréniasantes). When 
they look upon (hotan bleposin). Indefinite temporal clause 
with hotan and the present active subjunctive of dlepa. 
The smoke of her burning (ton kapnon tés puroseds autes). 
Purosis is an old word (from purod to burn), in N.T. only 


440 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


I Pet. 4:12; Rev. 18:9, 18. See verse 8 for other plagues 
on Rome, but fire seems to be the worst (17:16; 18:8, 9, 
1i7$.1933)s 

10. Standing afar off (apo makrothen hestékotes). Perfect 
active (intransitive) participle of Aistémi. Vivid picture of 
the terrible scene, fascinated by the lurid blaze (cf. Nero’s 
delight in the burning of Rome in a.p. 64), and yet afraid 
to draw near. On apo makrothen see Mark 5:6. There is 
a weird charm in a burning city. They feared the same fate 
(cf. verse 7 for dasanismou, torment). W oe, woe, the great 
city (ouai, ouai, hé polis hé megal@). Only example in the 
Apocalypse of the nominative with ouai except verses 16, 
19, though in Luke 6:25 and common in LXX (ls. §:7, 11, 
etc.). For the dative see Rev. 8:13, once so “strong” (hé 
ischura)! In one hour (midi horai). Repeated in verses 
16, 19, and like midi hémerdi (in one day) in verse 8. Some 
MSS. have here mian horan, like poian horan (accusative of 
extent of time) in 3:3. See verse 8 (ho krinas) for hé krisis 
sou (thy judgment). This is the dirge of the kings. 

11. The merchants (hoi emporoi). As in 18:3, 15, 23. The 
dirge of the merchants follows the wail of the kings. Weep 
and mourn (klaiousin kai penthousin). Present active in- 
dicatives of k/aid and penthed as in verses g (for k/aio), 15, 
19. For no man buyeth their merchandise any more (hoti ton 
gomon auton oudeis agorazei ouketi). Reason enough for 
their sorrow over Rome’s fall. Gomos is old word (from: 
gemo to be full) for a ship’s cargo (Acts 21:3) and then any 
merchandise (Rev. 18:11f.). Galen, Pliny, Aristides tell of 
the vastness of the commerce and luxury of Rome, the 
world’s chief market. Many of the items here are like those 
in the picture of the destruction of Tyre in Ezek. 26 and 
27. There are twenty-nine items singled out in verses 12 
and 13 of this merchandise or cargo (gomon), imports into 
the port of Rome. Only a few need any comment. 

12. Of fine linen (bussinou). Genitive case after gomon, 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 441 


as are all the items to kokkinou. Old adjective from dussos 
(linen, Luke 16:19), here a garment of linen, in N.T. only 
Rev. 18:12, 16; 19:8, 14. Purple (porphuras). Fabric col- 
ored with purple dye (porphureos, 17:4; 18:16), as in Mark 
1§:17, 20; Luke 16:19. Silk (sirikou). So the uncials here. 
To sérikon (the silken fabric) occurs in Plutarch, Strabo, 
Arrian, Lucian, only here in N.T. Probably from the name 
of the Indian or Chinese people (hoi Séres) from whom the 
fabric came after Alexander invaded India. Silk was a 
costly article among the Romans, and for women as a rule. 
Scarlet (kokkinou). See 17:4 and 18:16. All thyine wood | 
(pan xulon thuinon). Now accusative again without gomon 
dependence. An odoriferous North African citrus tree, 
prized for the colouring of the wood for dining-tables, like 
a peacock’s tail or the stripes of a tiger or panther. Here 
only in N.T. Of ivory (elephantinon). Old adjective (from 
elephas elephant) agreeing with skeuos (vessel), here only 
in N.T. Cf. Ahab’s ivory palace (I Kings 22:39). Of mar- 
ble (marmarou). Old word (from marmairé, to glisten), 
genitive after skeuos (vessel), here only in N.T. 

13. Cinnamon (kinnamomon). Old word transliterated 
into English, here only in N.T. Of Phcenician origin (Hero- 
dotus) as to name and possibly from South China. Spice 
(amomon). A fragrant plant of India, amomum, for per- 
fume. Incense (thumiamata). See 5:8; 8:3. Ointment 
(muron). See Matt. 26:7. Frankincense (libanon). See 
8:3. Fine flour (semidalin). Old word for finest wheaten 
flour, here only in N.T. Of horses (hippon). Here then is 
a return to the construction of the genitive after gomon in 
verse 12, though not used here, an anomalous genitive con- 
struction (Charles). Of chariots (redon). A Gallic word for 
a vehicle with four wheels, here only in N.T. Of slaves 
(somaton). “Of bodies,” treated as animals or implements, 
like the horses and the chariots (cf. rickshaw men in China). 
This use of sdma for slave occurs in Gen. 34:29; Tob. 10:11 


442 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(somata kai ktené, slaves and cattle); II Macc. 8:11. Souls 
of men (psuchas anthropon). Deissmann (Bible Studies, p. 
160) finds this use of soma for slave in the Egyptian Delta. 
Return to the accusative psuchas. From Numb. 31:35; I 
Chron. 5:21; Ezek. 27:13. ‘This addition is an explanation 
of the use of sdmata for slaves, “human live stock” (Swete), 
but slaves all the same. Perhaps kai here should be ren- 
dered “‘even,”’ not ‘‘and”: “bodies even souls of men.” 
The slave merchant was called sdmatemporos (body mer- 
chant). 

14. The fruits (hé opora). The ripe autumn fruit (Jer. 
40:10, 12). Here only in N.T. Of uncertain etymology 
(possibly opos, sap, Adra, hour, time for juicy sap). See 
Jude 12 for dendra phthinoporinos (autumn trees). Which 
thy soul lusteth after (sou tes epithumias tes psuchés). “Of 
the lusting of thy soul.” Are gone from thee (apélthen apo 
sou). Prophetic aorist active indicative of aperchomai with 
repetition of apo. All things that were dainty and sumptuous 
(panta ta lipara kai ta lampra). “All the dainty and the 
gorgeous things.” Liparos is fram /ipos (grease) and so fat, 
about food (here only in N.T.), while /ampros is bright and 
shining (James 2:2f.), about clothing. dre perished from 
thee (apoleto apo sou). Prophetic second aorist middle in- 
dicative of apollumi (intransitive). Shall find them no more 
at all (ouketi ou mé auta heurésousin). Doubled double 
negative with future active, as emphatic a negation as the 
Greek can make. 

15. Of these things (touton). Listed above in verses 12 to 
14. Who were made rich by her (hoi ploutésantes ap’ autes). 
“Those who grew rich (ingressive aorist active participle of 
plouteo, for which see verses 3 and 13) from her.” Shall 
stand afar off (apo makrothen stesontai). Future middle of 
histemi. Repeating the picture in verse 10. Again in verse 
17. See verse 11 for the two participles k/aiontes kai pen- 
thountes. 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 443 


16. For the Woe see verses 10, 19. For the next clause 
see 17:4 with the addition here of bussinon (18:12). For in 
one hour so great riches is made desolate (hoti midi horai 
eremothé ho tosoutos ploutos). The reason (hoti) for the 
“woe.” First aorist .passive indicative of er@mod, for which 
verb see 17:16 and 18:19. This is the dirge of the merchants. 

17. Shipmaster (kubernétés). Old word (from kubernad, 
to steer), helmsman, sailing-master, in N.T. only here and 
Acts 27:11. Subordinate to the naukléros (supreme com- 
mander). That saileth any whither (ho epi topon pleon). 
“The one sailing to a place.” See Acts 27:2, tous kata ten 
Asian pleontas (those sailing down along Asia). Nestle 
suggests ponton (sea) here for topon (place), but it makes 
sense as it is. Mariners (nautai). Old word (from naus, 
ship), in N.T. only here and Acts 27:27, 30. Gain their 
living by the sea (tén thalassan ergazontai). ‘Work the sea.” 
This idiom is as old as Hesiod for sailors, fishermen, etc. 
See verses 10, 15. 

18. As they looked (blepontes). Present active participle 
of blepd. See hotan bleposin in verse 10. What city is like 
the great city? (tis homoia tei polei tei megaléi;). No polis 
with ¢is, but implied. Associative instrumental case, as 
usual, with homoia. “The eternal city” is eternal no longer. 

19. They cast dust (ebalon choun). Second aorist active 
of dallo. Chous is old word (from ched to pour) for heap of 
earth, dust, in N.T. only here and Mark 6:11. Cf. Ezek. 
27:30; Luke 10:13. This is the dirge of the sea-folk (cf. 
verses 10, 16). By reason of her costliness (ek tés timiotétos 
autes). Occasionally in later literary Greek, though here 
only in N.T. and not in LXX. The same use of timé ap- 
pears in I Pet. 2:7. Common in the papyri as a title like 
“Your Honor” (Moulton and Milligan’s Vocabulary). 

20. Rejoice over her (Euphrainou ep’ autéi). Present mid- 
dle imperative of euphraind, for which verb see 11:10, used 
there of the joy of the wicked over the death of the two 


444 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


witnesses, just the opposite picture to this. “The song of 
doom” (Charles) here seems to be voiced by John himself. 
God hath judged your judgment (ekrinen ho theos to krima). 
First aorist (prophetic) active of krind and cognate accusa- 
tive krima, here a case for trial (Ex. 18:22; I Cor. 6:7), 
not a sentence as in 17:1. God has approved the case of 
heaven. 

a1. A strong angel (heis aggelos ischuros). Here heis=a, 
just an indefinite article, not “one” as a numeral. Took 
up (éren). First aorist active indicative of aird. As it were 
a great millstone (hos mulinon megan). Late adjective, in 
inscriptions, here only in N.T., made of millstone (mu/os, 
Matt. 18:6; Rev. 18:22), while mulikos (Luke 17:2) means 
belonging to a mill. This is not a small millstone turned 
by women (Matt. 24:41), but one requiring an ass to turn 
it (Mark 9:42), and so “a great” one. Cast (ebalen). 
Second aorist active of da/lé, to hurl. With a mighty fall 
(hormémati). Instrumental case (manner) of horméma, a 
rush, old word from hormad, to rush (Matt. 8:32), here only 
in N.T. Shall be cast down (blethésetai). Future (first) pas- 
sive of dallé, the same verb (ebalen), effective punctiliar 
future. Like a bowlder hurled into the sea. Shall be found 
no more at all (ou mé heurethéi eti). Double negative with 
first aorist passive subjunctive of heuriskd. See 9:6 for 
ou mé with the active voice of heuriskd. Already the old 
Babylon was a desert waste (Strabo, XVI. 1073). Pag - 

22. The voice (phoné). Cf. Ezek. 26:13. Or “‘sound” as 
in I Cor. 14:8 with salpigx (trumpet). For this song of 
judgment see Jer. 25:10. Of harpers (kithardidon). Old 
word (from kithara, harp, and didos, singer) as in 14:2. 
Of minstrels (mousikon). Old word (from mousa, music), 
here only in N.T., one playing on musical instruments. Of 
flute-players (aulétén). Old word (from auled, to play on-a 
flute, Matt. 11:17, aulos, flute, I Cor. 14:7), in N.T. only 
here and Matt. 9:23. Of trumpeters (salpiston). Late form 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 445 


for the earlier salpigktés (from salpizo), here only in N.T. 
Shall be heard no more at all (ou mé akousthéi). First aorist 
passive subjunctive of akoud with the double negative as 
below, with phoné mulou (sound of the millstone), and as 
in verse 21 with ou me heurethéi and again with pas technités 
(craftsman). This old word is from techné, art, as here in 
some MSS. (“‘of whatsoever craft,” pasés technés). Tech- 
nités occurs also in this sense in Acts 19:24, 38 and in Heb. 
11:10 of God as the Architect. There is power in this four- 
fold sonorous repetition of ou mé and the subjunctive with 
two more examples in verse 23. 

23. Of a lamp (luchnou). Old word (Matt. Rri¢ ys lapain= 
in Rev. 22:5. Shall shine no more at all (ou mé phaniét). 
Fifth instance in these verses of ou mé with the aorist sub- 
junctive, here the active of phaind as in Rev. 8:12. It is 
not known whether Rome had street lights or not. The 
voice of the bridegroom and of the bride (phoné numphiou kai 
numphés). See John 3:29 and Jer. 7:34; 16:9. “Even the 
occasional flash of the torches carried by bridal processions 
(Matt. 25:1ff.) is seen no more” (Swete). The sixth instance 
of ou mé, in verses 21 to 23, occurs with akousthéi (third in- 
stance of akousthéi, two in verse 22). Were the princes of 
the earth (ésan hoi megistanes tés gés). For megistan see Rev. 
6:15, and Mark 6:21. “Thy merchants were the grandees” 
once, but now these merchant princes are gone. With thy 
sorcery (en tei pharmakiai sou). En (instrumental use) and 
the locative case of pharmakia, old word (from pharmakeud, 
to prepare drugs, from pharmakon, sorcery, Rev. 9:21), in 
N.T. only here and Gal. 5:20 for sorcery and magical arts. 
If one is puzzled over the connection between medicine and 
sorcery as illustrated by this word (our pharmacy), he has 
only to recall quackery today in medicine (patent medicines 
and cure-alls), witch-doctors, professional faith-healers, med- 
icine-men in Africa. True medical science has had a hard 
fight to shake off chicanery and charlatanrv. Were deceived 


446 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(eplanéthésan). First aorist passive indicative of planao. 
These charlatans always find plenty of victims. See Mark 
2 c24x 

24. In her (en autéi). In Rome. Was found (heurethé). 
First aorist passive indicative of heuriskd. See 16:6; 17:6 
for the blood already shed by Rome. Rome “butchered to 
make a Roman holiday” (Dill, Roman Society, p. 242) not 
merely gladiators, but prophets and saints from Nero’s mas- 
sacre A.D. 64 to Domitian and beyond. Of all that have been 
slain (panton ton esphagmenon). Perfect passive articular 
participle genitive plural of sphazé, the verb used of the Lamb 
slain (5:9, 12; 13:8). Cf. Matt. 23:35 about Jerusalem. 


CHAPTER XIX 


1. After these things (meta tauta). Often when a turn 
comes in this book. But Beckwith is probably correct in 
seeing in 19:1—5 the climax of chapter 18. This first voice 
(verses 1 and 2) hds phonén megalén ouchlou pollou (as it 
were great voice of much multitude) is probably the response 
of the angelic host (Rev. 5:11; Heb. 12:22). There is re- 
sponsive singing (grand chorus) as in chapters 4 and i. 
Saying (legonton). Present active participle of /egd, genitive 
plural, though och/ou is genitive singular (collective sub- 
stantive, agreement in sense). Hallelujah (Allélouia). Trans- 
literation of the Hebrew seen often in the Psalms (LXX) 
and in III. Macc. 7:13, in N.T. only in Rev. 19:1, 3, 4, 6. 
It means, “‘Praise ye the Lord.” Fifteen of the Psalms 
begin or end with this word. The Great Hallel (a title for 
“Psalms 104 to 109”’) is sung chiefly at the feasts of the 
passover and tabernacles. This psalm of praise uses lan- 
guage already in 12:10. 

2. For (hoti). Because. The reason for God’s judgments 
is given in 15:3; 16:7. The doom of Babylon seen in 14:7 is 
now realized. For (hoti). Second use of hoti, explaining the 
first. He hath judged (ekrinen). First aorist (prophetic and 
climacteric, effective) active indicative of krind. Which 
(Aétis). The very one which. Did corrupt (ephtheiren). 
This is the terrible fact. First aorist active indicative of 
phtheiro. Cf. 11:18; 14:8; 17:2; 18:3. And he hath avenged 
(kai exedikésen). God has exacted vengeance for the blood 
of his servants from (ek) her. Prophetic aorist again of 
ekdiked with accusative and ek with ablative as in 6:10. 

3: 4 second time (deuteron). Adverbial accusative, a 
heavenly encore. They say (eirékan). Perfect active indica- 

447 


448 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


tive of eipon. “They have said,” not an “aoristic” perfect 
for “‘they say,” but vivid dramatic perfect as in 5:7 and the 
form in -an instead of -asin as in 18:3; 21:6. Goeth up (ana- 
bainei). Linear present active indicative of anabaind, 
“keeps on going up,” “‘a last touch to the description al- 
ready given (18:21ff.) of Babylon’s utter collapse” (Swete). 
The smoke of the city’s ruin (14:11; 18:8f., 18) instead of 
incense (8:4). Cf. Is. 34:9f. 

4. Fell down and worshipped God (epesan kai prosekunésan 
toi thedi). Precisely as in 7:11, which see. The twenty-four 
elders and the four living creatures take up the antiphonal 
chorus of the angels. 

5. A voice from the throne (phoné apo tou thronou). Not 
the voice of God, nor of the Lamb, nor ek tou naou (16:17), 
but from an angel of the Presence. This angel summons all 
the servants of God to join in the antiphonal praise to God. 
Give praise to our God (aineite toi thedi hémon). Present 
active imperative of ained, old verb, with the accusative 
elsewhere in N.T., but here with the dative as occasionally 
in the LXX (I Chron. 16:36, etc.). 

6. As it were the voice (hos phonén). Used here three 
times, as once in verse I: once of a second great multitude 
(ochlou pollou), not of angels as in verse 1, but the innumer- 
able multitude of the redeemed of 7:9; then “of many 
waters” (hudaton pollon) as in 1:15 and 14:2 like “the roar 
of a cataract”’ (Swete); and once more “‘the voice of mighty - 
thunders” (dronton ischuron) as in 6:1 and 10:3ff. Saying 
(legonton). ‘The best attested reading, genitive plural of 
legd, agreeing with och/ou (genitive singular), for roll of the 
waters and the roar of the thunders were not articulate. 
Some MSS. have /egontes (nominative plural) referring also 
to ochlou, though nominative instead of genitive. The fourth 
“Hallelujah” comes from this vast multitude. The Lord 
our God, the Almighty (Kurios, ho theos, ho pantokrator). For 
this designation of God see also 1:8; 4:8; 11:17; 15:3; 16:7, 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 449 


145 19:15; 21:22. Cf. deus et dominus noster used of the 
Roman emperor. Reigneth (ebasileusen). First aorist ac- 
tive of basileud. Probably ingressive prophetic aorist, “God 
became king” in fulness of power on earth with the fall 
of the world power. | 

7. Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad (chairmen kai 
agalliomen). Present active subjunctive (volitive) of chaira 
and agalliad (elsewhere in N.T. in the middle except Luke 
1:47; I Pet. 1:8). For both verbs together see Matt. Rene: 
Let us give (ddmen). Second aorist active subjunctive of 
didomi, but A reads dosomen (future active) and P dosamen. 
If the future indicative is read, the tone is changed from - 
exhortation to declaration (we shall give glory unto him). 
The marriage of the Lamb (ho gamos tou arniou). In the 
O.T. God is the Bridegroom of Israel (Hos. 2:16; Is. 54:6; 
Ezek. 16:7ff.). In the N.T. Christ is the Bridegroom of the 
Kingdom (the universal spiritual church as seen by Paul, 
If Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:25ff., and by John in Rev. 3:20; 19:7, 
9; 21:2, 9; 22:17. In the Gospels Christ appears as the 
Bridegroom (Mark 2:19f.; Matt. 9:15; Luke 5:34f.; John 
3:29). The figure of gamos occurs in Matt. 22:2-14. Three 
metaphors of women appear in the Apocalypse (the Mother 
in chapter 12, the Harlot in 17 to 19, and the Bride of Christ 
here to the end). “The first and third present the Church 
under two different aspects of her life, while the second 
answers to her great rival and enemy” (Swete). Js come 
(é/then). Prophetic aorist, come at last. Made herself ready 
(hétoimasen heautén). First aorist active indicative of hetoi.- 
mazo and the reflexive pronoun. See 22:2 for hétoimasmenén 
hos numphén (prepared as a bride). There is something for 
her to do (I John 3:3; Jude 21; II Cor. 7:1), but the chief 
preparation is the act of Christ (Eph. 5:25ff.). 

8. That she should array herself (hina peribalétai). Sub- 
final object clause subject of edothé (was given to her) with 
hina and the second aorist middle (direct) of periballé to 


450 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


fling around. This bridal dress is a gift from Christ. This 
form, edothé (it was given), occurs some 20 times in this 
book. In fine linen, bright and pure (bussinon lampron 
katharon). See 19:14 for the same raiment on those accom- 
panying “The Word of God” and for the seven angels in 
16:6. See by contrast the garments of the harlot (17:4; 
18:16). For dussinon see 18:16. The righteous acts of the 
saints (ta dikaidmata ton hagion). This is the explanation 
(gar) of the bridal dress and explains why there is work for 
the Bride as well as for Christ (Phil. 2:12f.). See 15:4 for 
dikaioma (also Rom. 5:18). 

9. Write (Grapson). First aorist active imperative of 
graphd as in 1:11; 14:13. The speaker may be the angel 
guide of 17:1. It is another beatitude (makarioi, Blessed) 
like that in 14:13 (fourth of the seven in the book). They 
which are bidden (hoi keklémenoi). Articular perfect passive 
participle of kaled, like Matt. 22:3; Luke 14:17. Cf. Rev. 
17:14. This beatitude reminds us of that in Luke 14:15. 
(Cf. Matt. 8:11; 26:29.) These are true words of God (Houtot 
hoi logoi aléthinoi tou theou eisin). Undoubtedly, but one 
should bear in mind that apocalyptic symbolism “has its 
own methods and laws of interpretation, and by these the 
student must be guided” (Swete). 

10. To worship him (proskunésai autoi). First aorist ac- 
tive infinitive of purpose. John either felt that the angel 
represented God or he was beside himself with excitement . 
over the glorious consummation. He was tempted to wor- 
ship an angel (Col. 2:18). See thou do it not (hora mé). 
Repeated in 22:9. Here there is no verb after mé (ellipse 
of poiéséis touto) as in Mark 1:44; I Thess. 5:15), the aorist 
subjunctive of negative purpose with mé after hora (present 
active imperative of horad), a common enough idiom. ° Fe/- 
low-servant (sundoulos). The angel refuses worship from 
John on this ground. All Christians are sundouloi (fellow- 
servants) as Christ taught (Matt. 18:28ff.; 24:49) and as 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 451 


Paul (Col. 1:7; 4:7) and John (Rev. 6:11) taught. Angels 
are God’s servants also (Heb. 1:4-14). For “the testimony 
of Jesus” see 1:2, 9; 6:9; 12:17; 22:4. Worship God (tii 
thedi proskunéson). And Christ, who is the Son of God 
(5:13f.). The spirit of prophecy (to pneuma tes prophéteias). 
Explanatory use of gar (for) here as in 8. The possession 
of the prophetic spirit shows itself in witness to Jesus. In 
illustration see Mark 1:10; Matt. 3:16; Luke 3:21; John 
Papi; RevitgsnsptOstsi11s193 142175152553) 18:13 19:1; 7-9. 

11. The heaven opened (ton ouranon énedigmenon). Per- 
fect passive participle (triple reduplication) of anoigd. Ac- 
cusative case after eidon. So Ezekiel (1:1) begins his 
prophecy. See also the baptism of Jesus (Matt. 3:16= 
Luke 3:21, but schizomenous in Mark 1:10). Jesus predicted 
the opened heavens to Nathanael (John 1:51). In Rev. 4:1 
a door is opened in heaven, the sanctuary is opened (11:19; 
15:5), angels come out of heaven (10:1; 14:17; 18:1), and 
sounds come from heaven (19:1). Behold, a white horse 
(idou hippos leukos). Nominative case because of idou, not 
eidon. Cf. 6:2 for hippos leukos. The emblem of victory in 
both cases, but the riders are very different. Here it is 
the Messiah who is the Warrior, as is made plain by “‘Faith- 
ful and True”’ (pistos kai alethinos), epithets already applied 
to Christ (1:5; 3:7, 14). Cf. also 22:6. In righteousness he 
doth judge and make war (en dikaiosunéi krinei kai polemei). 
See Is. 11:3ff. The Messiah is both Judge and Warrior, 
but he does both in righteousness (15:3; 16:5, 7; 19:2). 
He passes judgment on the beast (antichrist) and makes 
war on him. Satan had offered Christ a victory of com- 
promise which was rejected. 

12. A flame of fire (phlox puros). As in the opening vision 
of Christ in 1:14 (2:18). Many diadems (diadémata polla). 
A new feature, but the dragon has a diadem on each of his 
seven heads (12:3) and the first beast one upon each of 
his ten horns (13:1). So the victorious Messiah will wear 


452 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


many royal diadems and not mere crowns, because he is 
King of kings (19:16). And he hath (kai echon). Nomina- 
tive active present participle of echd either used absolutely 
as an independent verb (like indicative) or in an anacoluthon, 
though autou (his) is genitive. 4 name written (onoma 
gegrammenon). Perfect passive participle of graphd as in 
2:17 (cf. 3:12). But he himself (ei mé autos). ““Except 
himself” (common ellipsis of the verb after ef mé, “if not”’). 
See 2:17 and 3:12 for the new name there described. See 
14:1 for the name of Christ on the forehead of the 144,000, 
and 17:5 for the name on the forehead of the harlot. This 
word here supplements what Jesus says in Matt. 11:27. 

13. Arrayed (peribeblemenos). Perfect passive participle 
of periballé, to clothe, often in this book. Jn a garment 
(himation). Accusative case after the passive participle 
peribeblémenos. Sprinkled (rerantismenon). Perfect passive 
participle of rantizd, in the predicate accusative case agree- 
ing with Aimation. A Q here read bebammenon (perfect pas- 
sive participle of dapto, to dip). Probably rerantismenon 
(sprinkled) is correct, because the picture comes from Is. 
63:3, where Aquila and Symmachus use rantizd. The use 
of bebammenon (dipped) is a bolder figure and Charles con- 
siders it correct. In either case it is the blood of Christ’s 
enemies with which his raiment (Aimation, perhaps a chlamus 
Matt. 27:28, 31) is sprinkled or dipped as the case may be, 
not his own blood on Calvary (1:5; 5:9; 7:14; 12:11), but | 
proleptically and prophetically the blood of Christ’s en- 
emies. Haimati can be either locative case with debam- 
menon (dipped in blood) or instrumental with rerantismenon 
(sprinkled with blood). The Word of God (ho Logos tou 
theou). Some scholars hold this addition inconsistent with 
verse 12, but it may be merely the explanation of the secret 
name or still another name besides that known only to 
himself. The personal use of the Logos applied to Christ 
occurs only in the Johannine writings unless that is the idea 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 453 


in Heb. 4:12. In John 1:1, 14 it is merely Ao Logos (the 
Word), in I John 1:1 Ao Logos tés zd@s (the Word of Life), 
while here it is ho Logos tou theou (the Word of God), one 
of the strongest arguments for identity of authorship. The 
idiom here is one common in Luke and Paul for the teach- 
ing of Christ (Luke 5:1; 8:11, etc.; I Cor. 14:36; II Cor. 
2:17, etc.). Jesus is himself the final and perfect revelation 
of God to men (Heb. 1:1f.). 

14. The armies which are in heaven (ta strateumata ta en 
t0i ourandt). See 12:7 for Michael and angels warring with 
the dragon, and also Matt. 26:53 for the angels at Christ’s 
call, not to say Heb. 1:6f., 14; Matt. 13:41; Rev. s:11f. . 
Followed (ékolouthei). Imperfect active and singular (strate- 
umata, neuter plural) of akolouthed, graphic picture of the 
celestial Warrior with his angelic hosts “upon white horses” 
(eph’ hippois leukois) like the Leader and, like him “‘clothed 
in fine linen white and pure” (endedumenoi bussinon leukon 
katharon) like the Leader again (19:8). Note endedumenoi 
here as in 1:13 and 15:6. 

15. 4 sharp sword (romphaia oxeia). As in 1:16 and 2:12, 
15. That he should smite (hina pataxéi). Purpose clause 
with hina and the first aorist active subjunctive of patassd, 
old verb already in 11:6 and like Is. 11:4, a figure here for 
forensic and judicial condemnation. And he shall rule them 
(kai autos poimanei). Emphatic use of autos twice (he him- 
self). Future active of poimaind, to shepherd as in 2:27, 
and 12:5 “with a rod of iron” (en rabdoi sidérdi) as there. 
See I] Pet. 2:25 and Heb. 13:20 for Christ as Shepherd. 
And he treadeth (kai autos patei). Change to present tense 
of pated, to tread (here transitive), with solemn repetition 
of kai autos. The winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of 
Almighty God (ten lenon tou oinou tou thumou tés orges tou 
theou tou pantokratoros). Literally, “the winepress of the 
wine of the wrath of the anger of God the Almighty” (four 
genitives dependent on one another and on /énon). These 


4s4 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


images are here combined from 14:8, 10, 19f.; 16:19. The 
fact is already in 19:13 after Is. 63:1ff. 

16. And on his thigh (kai epi ton méron autou). “Even 
upon his thigh.” Old word, here alone in N.T. King of 
kings, and Lord of lords (Basileus basileon kai Kurios kurion). 
The title already given to the Lamb in 17:14, but in reverse 
order. See the same idea in I Tim. 6:15. 

17. An angel (hena aggelon). Like heis in 18:21, just 
“an,” not “one.” Standing in the sun (hestota en toi héli61). 
Second perfect active participle of Aist@mi (intransitive). 
“Where all the birds of prey would behold him” (Beck- 
with). For orneois (birds) see 18:2 and for en mesouranémati 
(in mid heaven) see 18:13; 14:6. Come and be gathered to- 
gether (Deute sunachthéte). Deute is the adverb deuro (hither), 
used when two or more are addressed, possibly from deuro 
ite (come here). Asyndeton also without kai (and). First 
aorist passive imperative of sunagd. The metaphor is drawn 
from Ezek. 39:17. Unto the great supper of God (eis to 
deipnon to mega tou theou). The habits of vultures are de- 
scribed by Christ in Matt. 24:28. This is a bold and power- 
ful picture of the battlefield after the victory of the Messiah, 
“a sacrificial feast spread on God’s table for all the vultures 
of the sky” (Swete). Is this battle the same as that of Har 
Magedon (16:16) and that of Gog and Magog (20:8ff.) men- 
tioned after the thousand years? The language in 20:8ff. 
seems like this derived from Ezek. 39:17ff., and “in the. 
Apocalypse priority in the order of sequence does not always 
imply priority in time” (Swete). There seems no way to 
decide this point save that the end seems to be at hand. 

18. That ye may eat (hina phagéte). Purpose clause with 
hina and the second aorist active subjunctive of esthid. The 
flesh of kings (sarkas basiledn). “Pieces of flesh” (plural of 
sarx, flesh) and of all classes and conditions of men who fell 
in the battle (6:18; 11:13; 13:16; 19:5; 20:12). War is no 
respecter of persons. 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 455 


19. Gathered together (sunégmena). Perfect passive par- 
ticiple of sunagd. In battle array. To make war against 
(poiésai polemon meta). First aorist active infinitive of 
poied, to express purpose. See polemed meta in 12:7 and the 
use of sunagd eis polemon in 16:14; 20:8. The beast (for 
his army see 16:13f.) led a league of ten kings against 
Babylon in 17:16f., but with the purpose also of fighting 
the Lamb (17:14). 

20. Was taken (epiasthé). First aorist (prophetic) passive 
indicative of the Doric piazd (Attic piezo). Cf. II Thess. 
2:8. The false prophet (ho pseudoprophétés). Possibly the 
second beast of 13:11-17; 16:13; 20:10. Charles takes him - 
to be “the priesthood of the Imperial cult, which practised 
all kinds of magic and imposture to beguile men to worship 
the Beast.” That wrought the signs in his sight (ho poiésas 
ta sémeia endpion autou). Asin 13:14. Wherewith (en hois). 
“In which” signs. He deceived (eplanésen). First aorist 
active indicative of planad. He was only able to deceive 
“them that had received” (tous Jabontas, articular second 
aorist active participle of /amband, ‘those receiving’’) “the 
mark of the beast” (13:16; 14:9ff.; 16:2; 20:4) “‘and them 
that worshipped his image” (tous proskunountas tei eikoni 
autou) as in 13:15. They twain (hoi duo). “The two.” 
Were cast (ebléthésan). First aorist passive indicative of 
ballo. They fall together as they fought together. ‘‘The 
day that sees the end of a false statecraft will see also that 
of a false priestcraft” (Swete). live (zdntes). Present ac- 
tive participle of zd, predicative nominative, “living.” 
Into the lake of fire (eis tén limnén tou puros). Genitive puros 
describes this /imnén (lake, cf. Luke 5:1) as it does gehenna 
in Matt. 5:22. See also 20:10; 21:8. It is a different figure 
from the “abyss” in g:1ff. and 20:1ff. This is the final 
abode of Satan, the beast, the false prophet, and wicked 
men. That burneth with brimstone (tés kaiomenés en thei0t). 
Note the genitive here in place of the accusative limnén, 


456 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


perhaps because of the intervening genitive puros (neuter, 
not feminine). The agreement is regular in 21:8. For en 
theioi (with brimstone) see 14:10; 20:10; 21:8. The fact 
of hell is clearly taught here, but the imagery is not to be 
taken literally any more than that of heaven in chapters 
4, 5) 21, 22 is to be so understood. Both fall short of the 
reality. 

21. The rest (hoi loipoi). Of the enemy (the kings and 
their hosts of verse 19). Were killed (apektanthésan). First 
aorist (effective) passive indicative of apokteind. Those 
affected by the Cesar-worship (14:9ff.) were not at once 
cast into the lake with the two beasts. Were filled (echortas- 
thésan). First aorist (effective) passive of chortazd. As they 
had been invited to do in verse 17. 


CHAPTER XX 


1. Coming down out of heaven (katabainonta ek tou ouranou). 
As in 10:1; 18:1. The key of the abyss (tén klein tés abussou). 
As in 9:1. 4 great chain (halusin megalen). Paul wore a 
halusis (alpha privative and /ué, to loose) in Rome (II Tim. 
1:16), as did Peter in prison in Jerusalem (Acts 12:6). In 
his hand (epi tén cheira autou). “Upon his hand,” ready 
for use. See epi with the genitive in 1:20. 

2. He laid hold on (ekratésen). First aorist active indica- 
tive of krated, to seize. The dragon (ton drakonta). Accusa- 
tive after ekratésen instead of the genitive as in 2:1. He has 
been behind the beast and the false prophet from the start. 
Now he is seized. The old serpent (ho ophis ho archaios). 
Precisely the description in 12:9, only the nominative is here 
retained, though in apposition with the accusative fon 
drakonta, a frequent anacoluthon in the Apocalypse (1:5, 
etc.). Swete calls it a parenthesis. Which is (hos estin). 
The relative here relieves the construction and takes the 
place of ho kaloumenos in 12:9 before Diabolos kai ho Satanas. 
And bound him (kai edésen auton). First aorist active in- 
dicative of deo. For a thousand years (chilia et@). Accusative 
of extent of time. Here we confront the same problem found 
in the 1260 days. In this book of symbols how long is a 
thousand years? All sorts of theories are proposed, none 
of which fully satisfy one. Perhaps Peter has given us the 
only solution open to us in II Pet. 3:8 when he argues that 
“one day with the Lord is as a thousand years and a thou- 
sand years as one day.” It will help us all to remember 
that God’s clock does not run by ours and that times and 
seasons and programs are with him. This wonderful book 

457 


458 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


was written to comfort the saints in a time of great trial, 
not to create strife among them. 

3. Into the abyss (eis ten abusson). The one in g:1f. and 
the one spoken of by the legion of demons in Luke 8:31 
under the charge of the angel of the abyss (Apollyon, Rev. 
g:11) who is either Satan himself or a kindred power. 
“Already he has been cast out of Heaven (12:9), now he 
is cast out of the earth, and returns to his own place” 
(Swete). Shut it and sealed it (ekleisen kai esphragisen). 
Effective first aorists active indicative of k/eid and sphragizo. 
That he should deceive no more (hina mé planéséi). Negative 
purpose clause with hina mé and the first aorist active sub- 
junctive of planad. Glorious relief after the strain of the 
previous visions of conflict. Small wonder that Christians 
today cherish this blessed hope whatever the actual mean- 
ing may be. Until should be finished (achri telesthéi). Tem- 
poral clause of future purpose with achri (as a conjunction 
like eds) and the first aorist passive subjunctive of ¢eled. 
Repeated in verse 5 and see achri and the subjunctive in 
7:33 15:8. He must be loosed (dei luthénai). Sad necessity, 
alas, with dei and the first aorist passive infinitive of Jud. 
For a little time (mikron chronon). Accusative of time. 
Whatever the thousand years means, it is here said plainly 
that after it is over the devil will again have power on earth 
“for a little time.” 

4. And they sat upon them (kai ekathisan ep’ autous).. 
First aorist active indicative of kathizd. Another period 
here apparently synchronous (verse 7) with the confinement 
of Satan in the abyss. No subject is given for this plural 
verb. Apparently Christ and the Apostles (Matt. 19:28; 
Luke 22:30) and some of the saints (I Cor. 6:3), martyrs 
some hold. Yudgment was given unto them (krima édoth? 
autois). First aorist passive of diddmi. Picture of the 
heavenly court of assizes. The souls (tas psuchas). Accusa- 
tive after eidon at the beginning of the verse. Of them that 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 459 


had been beheaded (tin pepelekismenon). Genitive of the 
articular perfect passive participle of pelekizd, old word 
(from pelekus an axe, the traditional instrument for execu- 
tion in republican Rome, but later supplanted by the sword), 
to cut off with an axe, here only in N.T. See 6:9; 18:24; 
19:2 for previous mention of these martyrs for the witness 
of Jesus (1:9; 12:17; 19:10). Others also besides martyrs 
shared in Christ’s victory, those who refused to worship the 
beast or wear his mark as in 13:15; 14:9ff.; 16:2; 19:20. 
And they lived (kai ezésan). First aorist active indicative 
of za0. If the ingressive aorist, it means “came to life” ; 
or “‘lived again” as in 2:8 and so as to verse 5. If it is the 
constative aorist here and in verse 5, then it could mean 
increased spiritual life. See John 5:21-29 for the double 
sense of life and death (now literal, now spiritual) precisely 
as we have the second death in Rev. 2:11; 20:6, 14. And 
reigned with Christ (kai ebasileusan meta tou Christou). Same 
use of the first aorist active indicative of basileud, but more 
clearly constative. Beckwith and Swete take this to apply 
solely to the martyrs, the martyrs’ reign with Christ. 

5. The rest of the dead (hoi loipoi ton nekron). “All except 
the martyrs, both the righteous and the unrighteous” (Beck- 
with). But some take this to mean only the wicked. Lived 
not until the thousand years should be finished (ouk ezésan 
achri telesthét ta chilia et@). See verse 4 for the items here. 
“To infer from this statement, as many expositors have 
done, that the ezésan of v. 4 must be understood of bodily 
resuscitation, is to interpret apocalyptic prophecy by meth- 
ods of exegesis which are proper to ordinary narrative” 
(Swete). I sympathize wholly with that comment and con- 
fess my own ignorance therefore as to the meaning of the 
symbolism without any predilections for post-millennialism 
or premillennialism. This is the first resurrection (hauté hé 
anastasis hé proté). Scholars differ as to the genuineness of 
this phrase. Accepting it as genuine, Swete applies it to 


460 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


“the return of the martyrs and confessors to life at the 
beginning of the Thousand Years.” According to this view 
the first resurrection is a special incident in the present life 
before the Parousia. It has no parallel with I Thess. 4:16, 
where the dead in Christ are raised before those living are 
changed. Some think that John here pictures the “Re- 
generation” (palingenesia) of Matt. 19:28 and the “Res- 
toration” (apokatastasis) of Acts 3:21. No effort is here 
made to solve this problem, save to call attention to the 
general judgment out of the books in 20:12 and to the 
general resurrection in John 5:29 and Acts 24:15. 

6. Blessed and holy (makarios kai hagios). A fifth beati- 
tude (1:3; 14:13; 16:15; 19:9) already and two more to 
come (22:7, 14, seven in all). Here Aagios is added to the 
usual makarios. The second death (ho deuteros thanatos). 
The spiritual death of 2:11; 20:14; 21:8 in contrast to the 
first or physical death. This language raises a question 
about the interpretation of the first and the second resur- 
rections, whether both are of the body or one of the spirit. 
There seems no way to reach a solid conception about it. 
In I Cor. 15:23 there is no mention of the resurrection of 
any save “those of Christ” (hoi tou Christou), though the 
end follows (verse 24). However, Paul elsewhere (Acts 
24:15) speaks of the resurrection of the just and of the un- 
just as if one event. Priests of God and of Christ (hiereis 
tou theou kai tou Christou). As in 1:6; 5:10; 22:3, 5. Shall 
reign with him (basileusousin met autou). As promised in 
the same passages. The servants of God are to be priests 
with Christ and to reign with him (Matt. 19:28). In 5:10 
epi tes gés (upon earth) occurs, but this item does not appear 
here. “No hint is given as to where this service is to be 
rendered and this royalty to be exercised” (Swete). 

7. When are finished (hotan telesthéi). Indefinite future 
temporal clause with otan and the first aorist passive sub- 
junctive of teed, “‘whenever are finished.” Shall be loosed 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 461 


(futhésetai). Future passive of Jud, no longer bound as in 
20:2f. He uses the future as a prophet in verses 7 and 8, 
but in 9 and 10 he uses the aorist as a seer. Out of his prison 
(ck tés phulakés autou). For phulaké in this sense see 2:10. 
Out of the abyss of verses 2 and 3. 

8. To deceive the nations (planésai ta ethné). First aorist 
active infinitive of purpose of planad, Satan’s chief task 
(chapters 12 to 18, in particular 12:9; 13:14; 193203112033) 
10). Which are in the four corners of the earth (ta en tais 
tessarst goniais tes gés). Clearly the reign with Christ, if 
on earth, was not shared in by all on earth, for Satan finds 
a large and ready following on his release. See 7:1 (Is. 
11:12) for “the four corners of the earth.” Gog and Magog 
(ton Gog kai Magog). Accusative in explanatory apposition 
with ¢a ethné (the nations). Magog is first mentioned in 
Gen. 10:2. The reference here seems to be Ezek. g8ang 
where both are mentioned. Josephus (4nt. I. 6.1) iden- 
tifies Magog with the Scythians, with Gog as their prince. 
In the rabbinical writings Gog and Magog appear as the 
enemies of the Messiah. Some early Christian writers 
thought of the Goths and Huns, but Augustine refuses to 
narrow the imagery and sees only the final protest of the 
world against Christianity. To gather them together to the 
war (sunagagein autous eis ton polemon). Second aorist ac- 
tive infinitive of purpose of sunagd, a congenial task for 
Satan after his confinement. See 16:14 for this very phrase 
and also 17:14; 19:19. Of whom (hon—auton). Pleonasm 
or redundant pronoun as in 3:8 and often (of whom—of 
them). 4s the sand of the sea (hos h@ ammos tés thalassés). 
Already in 12:18. Clearly then the millennium, whatever 
it is, does not mean a period when Satan has no following 
on earth, for this vast host rallies at once to his standard. 

9. They went up (anebésan). Second aorist active indica- 
tive of anabaind, a return to the manner of the seer as in 
verses 4 and 5. Over the breadth of the earth (epi to platos 


q62 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


tés gés). Platos is old word, in N.T. only here, 21:16; Eph. 
3:18. The hosts of Satan spread over the earth. Compassed 
(ekukleusan). First aorist (prophetic) active indicative of 
kukleué, to encircle, late verb (Strabo) from kuk/os (circle), 
in N.T. only here and margin in John 10:24 (for ekuklosan 
from kukloo). The camp of the saints (ten parembolén ton 
hagion). Parembolé (para, en, ballo) is common late word 
for military camp, in LXX for the Israelites in the desert 
(Ex. 29:14, etc.), in N.T. for Roman barracks (Acts 24:34, 
37) and for an army in line of battle (Heb. 11:34; Rev. 
20:9). The beloved city (tén polin ten égapémenén). Perfect 
passive participle of agapad, “the city the beloved.” See 
Ps. 78:68; 87:2 for Jerusalem so described. So Charles takes 
it here, but Swete holds it to be “the Church the New Zion” 
that is meant. 4nd fire came down out of heaven (kai katebé 
pur ek tou ouranou). Second aorist (prophetic) active in- 
dicative of katabaind. Cf. Gen. 19:24; 39:6; Ezek. 38:22; 
II Kings 1:10, 12; Luke 9:54 (about John). Devoured them 
(katephagen autous). Second aorist (prophetic) active of 
katesthio, to eat up (down). Vivid climax to this last great 
battle with Satan. 

10. Was cast (ebléthé). First aorist (prophetic, affective) 
passive indicative of dalld (verse 3). Into the lake of fire 
and brimstone (eis ten limnén tou puros kai theiou). As in 
19:20 with the two beasts, as he adds, “‘where are also the 
beast and the false prophet” (hopou kai to thérion kai ho 
pseudoprophetés). They shall be tormented (basanisthésontai). 
Return to the prophetic future of verses 7 and 8. For 
basanizd see 9:5; 14:10. For “day and night” (Aémeras 
kai nuktos) see 4:8; 7:15; 12:10; 14:11. For “for ever and 
ever” (eis tous aidnas ton aidnodn) see 1:6, 18; 4:9, 103 5:13; 
7:12; 10:6; 11:15, etc. The devil was cast down from 
heaven (12:9), then imprisoned (20:2ff.), now he received 
his final doom. 

11. 4 great white throne (thronon megan leukon). Were 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 463 


megan (great) is added to the throne pictures in 4:4; 20:4. 
The scene is prepared for the last judgment often mentioned 
in the N.T. (Matt. 25:31-46; Rom. 14:10; IIT Cor. 5:10). 
“The absolute purity of this Supreme Court is symbolized 
by the colour of the Throne” (Swete) as in Dan. 7:9; Ps. 
9:1; 97:2. The name of God is not mentioned, but the 
Almighty Father sits upon the throne (4:2f., OM S2tp Mig: 
6:16; 7:10, 15; 19:4; 21:5), and the Son sits there with him 
(Heb. 1:3) and works with the Father (John §s19-21 102303 
Matt. 25:31ff.; Acts 17:31; II Cor. §:10; II Tim. 4:1). 
From whose face the earth and the heaven fled away (hou apo 
prosopou ephugen hé gé kai ho ouranos). Second aorist 
(prophetic) active of pheugd. See 16:20. The non-eternity 
of matter is a common teaching in the O.T. (Ps. OFi5y 
102:27; Is. 51:6) as in the N.T. (Mark 13:31; II Pet. Rs10): 
Was found (heurethé). First aorist passive indicative of 
heurisko. All is now spiritual. Even scientists today are 
speaking of the non-eternity of the universe. 

12. The dead, the great. and the small (tous nekrous tous 
megalous kai tous mikrous). The general resurrection of 
verse 13 is pictured by anticipation as already over. No 
living are mentioned after the battle of verses 7-10, though 
some will be living when Jesus comes to judge the quick 
and the dead (II Tim. 4:1; I Thess. 4:13ff.). All classes 
and conditions (11:18; 13:16; 19:5, 18) John saw “standing 
before the throne” (hestdtas endpion tou thronou). Books 
were opened (biblia énoichthésan). First aorist passive of 
anoigd. Like Dan. 7:10. The record of each human being 
has been kept in God’s books. Were judged (ekrithésan). 
First aorist passive indicative of krind. The sentence upon 
each rests upon written evidence. Another book which is 
the book of life (allo biblion ho estin tés z0és). This book has 
already been mentioned (3:5; 13:8; 17:8). “It is the roll 
of living citizens of Jerusalem” (Swete), “‘the church of the 
first born enrolled in heaven” (Heb. 12:23). The books are 


464 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


“the vouchers for the book of life” (Alford). We are saved 
by grace, but character at last (according to their works) 
is the test as the fruit of the tree (Matt. 7:16, 20; 10:32f.; 
26:31-46; John 15:6; II Cor. 5:10; Rom. 2:10; Rev. 2:23; 
20312; 22:12): 

13. Gave up (eddken). Just “gave” (first aorist active 
indicative of didémi), but for the sea to give is to give up 
(effective aorist). Sea as well as land delivers its dead (all 
kinds of dead, good and bad). Swete notes that accidental 
deaths will not prevent any from appearing. Milligan is 
sure that the sea here means “the sea of the troubled and 
sinful world.” Death and Hades (ho thanatos kai ho haidés). 
“An inseparable pair” (Swete) as in 1:18; 6:8; 20:14. So 
in Matt. 16:18 “the gates of Hades” means the power of 
death. Etymologically Hades is the unseen world where all 
who die are as opposed to this visible world, but in actual 
use Hades is sometimes treated as the abode of the un- 
righteous (Luke 16:23). Charles thinks that this is true 
here, though there is nothing to show it apart from the 
personification of death and Hades and the casting of both 
into the lake of fire in verse 14. Here again “each man” 
(hekastos) receives judgment according to his deeds (Matt. 
16:27 -Ti-Corin 3233 Te Corng:t03;Romig2i6s 24:12 yl Pet 
feds REV02223)3 

14. Were cast (ebléthésan). As the devil (20:10) followed 
the two beasts (19:20) into the same dread lake of fire. 
Death is personified and is disposed of, “‘the last enemy” 
(I Cor. 15:26) and Paul sings the pean of victory over 
death (I Cor. 15:54f., from Hos. 13:14). Hades has no more 
terrors, for the saints are in heaven. There is no more fear 
of death (Heb. 2:15), for death is no more (Rev. 21:4). 
The second death (2:11; 20:6; 21:8) is here identified as in 
21:8 with the lake of fire. 

15. If any was not found written in the book of life (ei tis 
ouch heurethé en téi bibloi tés z0é@s). Condition of first class 


<¢ 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 465 


with ei and the first aorist passive indicative of heuriské. 
In this short sentence the doom is told of all who are out 
of Christ, for they too follow the devil and the two beasts 
into the lake of fire (the counterpart of the Gehenna of fire, 
Matt. 5:22). There-is no room here for soul sleeping, for 
an intermediate state, for a second chance, or for annihila- 
tion of the wicked. In Dan. 12:2 there is a resurrection to 
death as well as to life and so in John §:29; Acts 24:15. 


CHAPTER XXI 


1. 4 new heaven and a new earth (ouranon kainon kai gen 
kainén). This new vision (eidon) is the picture of the bliss 
of the saints. The first heaven and the first earth (ho protos 
ouranos kai hé proté gé) are passed away (apélthan, went 
away, second aorist active indicative of aperchomai). “Fled 
away” (ephugen) in 20:11. And the sea is no more (kai hé 
thalassa ouk estin eti). The sea had given up its dead (20:13). 
There were great risks on the sea (18:17ff.). The old phys- 
ical world is gone in this vision. It is not a picture of reno- 
vation of this earth, but of the disappearance of this earth 
and sky (not heaven where God dwells). It is a glorious 
picture here in 21:1-8 in sharp contrast to the lake of fire 
in 20:11-15. The symbolism in neither case is to be pressed 
too literally, but a stern and a glorious reality exists behind 
it all. 

2. The holy city, new Ferusalem (ten polin ten hagian 
Terousalém kainén). “The New Earth must have a new 
metropolis, not another Babylon, but another and greater 
Jerusalem” (Swete), and not the old Jerusalem which was 
destroyed a.p. 70. It was called the Holy City in a conven- 
tional way (Matt. 4:5; 27:53), but now in reality because it is - 
new and fresh (kainén), this heavenly Jerusalem of hope 
(Heb. 12:22), this Jerusalem above (Gal. 4:26ff.) where our 
real citizenship is (Phil. 3:20). Coming down out of heaven 
from God (katabainousan ek tou ouranou apo tou theou). 
Glorious picture caught by John and repeated from 3:12 and 
again in 21:10. But Charles distinguishes this new city of 
God from that in 21:9 to 22:2 because there is no tree of life 
in this one. But one shrinks from too much manipulation of 
this symbolism. It is better to see the glorious picture with 

466 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 467 


John and let it tell its own story. Made ready (hétoimas- 
menen). Perfect passive participle of hetoimazd as in 19:7. 
The Wife of the Lamb made herself ready in her bridal 
attire. 4s a bride adorned (hos numphén kekosméemenén). 
Perfect passive participle of kosmed, old verb (from kosmos 
ornament like our cosmetics), as in 21:19. Only here the 
figure of bride is not the people of God as in 19:7, but the 
abode of the people of God (the New Jerusalem). For her 
husband (toi andri autés). Dative case of personal interest. 

3. The tabernacle of God is with men (hé skéné tou theou 
meta ton anthropon). It is one of the angels of the Presence 
(16:17; 19:5) speaking. And he shall dwell with them (kai 
skénosei met’ auton). Future active of skénod, already in 7:15 
from Ezek. 37:27; Zech. 2:10; 8:8 and used of the Incarnate 
Christ on earth by John (1:14), now a blessed reality of the 
Father. The metaphor stands for the Shekinah Glory of 
God in the old tabernacle (7:15; 13:6; 15:5), the true taber- 
nacle of which it was a picture (Heb. 8:2;9:11). God is now 
Immanuel in fact, as was true of Christ (Matt. 1:23). 

4. Shall wipe away every tear from their eyes (exaleipset pan 
dakruon ek ton ophthalmon auton). More exactly, “shall wipe 
out every tear out of their eyes” (repetition of ex) like a 
tender mother as in 7:17 (Is. 25:8). There is no more 
that ought to cause a tear, for death (thanatos) is no more, 
mourning (penthos), associated with death and crying 
(kraugé, wailing), and pain (ponos as in 16:10) are all gone. 
There is peace and bliss. 

5. Behold, I make all things new (Idou kaina poio panta). 
The first time since 1:8 that God has been represented as 
speaking directly, though voices have come out of the throne 
before (21:3) and out of the sanctuary (16:1, 17), which may 
be from God himself, though more likely from one of the 
angels of the Presence. This message is not addressed to 
John (7:14; 17:73 21:6; 22:6), but to the entire world of the 
blessed. See Is. 43:18f. for the words (Idou ego poid kaina).

The idea of a new heaven and a new earth is in Is. 65:17; 
66:22; Ps. 102:25f. For the locative here with epi (epi toi 
thronot) see 7:10; 19:4 (genitive more usual, 4:9f.; 5:1, 7, 13, 
etc.). See 20:11 for the picture. And he saith (kai legei). 
Probably this means a change of speakers, made plain by moi 
(to me) in many MSS. An angel apparently (as in 14:13; 
1g:9f.) assures John and urges him to write (grapson as in 
Ts1T;) 2:1, 8, 12, 185 3:15. 7, 145:14:3). 1! The reason given 
(hoti, for) is precisely the saying in 22:6 and he uses the two 
adjectives (pistoi kai aléthinoi) employed in 19:11 about God 
himself, and 3:14 about Christ. In 19:9 aléthinoi occurs also 
about “the words of God” as here. They are reliable and 
genuine. 

6. They are come to pass (Gegonan). Second perfect active 
indicative of ginomai with -an for -asi. See 16:17 for a like 
use of gegonen, “They have come to pass.” Here again it is 
the voice of God because, as in 1:8, He says: I am the Alpha 
and the Omega (Ego to Alpha kai to O) with the addition “the 
beginning and the end” (Aé arché kai to telos), the whole used 
in 22:13 of Christ. In Is. 44:6 there is something like the 
addition, and in Col. 1:18 and Rev. 3:14 4é arch? is applied 
to Christ, while here God is the First Cause (arché) and the 
Finality (¢e/os) as in Rom. 11:36 and Eph. 4:6. But God 
works through Christ (John 1:3; Heb. 1:2f.; Col. 1:12—20). 
God is the bountiful Giver (James 1:5, 17) of the Water of 
Life. See 7:17; 22:1, 17 for this metaphor, which is based . 
on Is. 55:1. It is God’s own promise (Egéd désd), “I will 
give.” Of the fountain (ek tés pégés). For this partitive use 
of ek see Matt. 25:8, without ek Rev. 2:17. Freely (dorean). 
See Matt. 10:8; John 4:10; Rom. 3:24; Acts 8:20; Rev. 22:17. 

7. He that overcometh (ho nikon). Recalls the promises at 
the close of each of the Seven Letters in chapters 2 and 3. 
Shall inherit (kleronomései). Future active of kléronomeo, 
word with great history (Mark 10:17; I Pet. 1:4; Gal. 4:7; 
Rom. 8:17), here interpreted for the benefit of these who 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 469 


share in Christ’s victory. J will be his God (Esomai autoi 
theos). Repeated Old Testament promise (first to Abraham, 
Gen. 17:7f.). Cf. Rev. 21:3. He shall be my son (autos 
estai moi huios). Made first of Solomon (II Sam. 7:14) and 
applied to David later in Ps. 89:26f. 

8. Their part shall be (to meros auton). In contrast to 
the state of the blessed (verses 3 to 7) the state of “those 
who have disfranchised themselves from the Kingdom of 
God”’ (Charles) is given. They are with Satan and the 
two beasts, and are the same with those not in the book of 
life (20:15) in the lake of fire and brimstone (19:20; 20:10, 
14f.), that is the second death (2:11; 20:6, 14). See also 
14:10. There are eight epithets here used which apply to 
various sections of this direful list of the doomed and the 
damned, all in the dative (case of personal interest). For 
the fearful (tois deilois). Old word (from deidé, to fear) for 
the cowardly, who recanted under persecution, in N.T. only 
here, Matt. 8:26; Mark 4:40. Unbelieving (apistois). “Faith- 
less,” “untrustworthy,” in contrast with Christ “ho pistos” 
(1:5). Cf. 2:10, 13; 3:14; 17:14. Disloyalty is close kin to 
cowardice. Abominable (ebdelugmenois). Perfect passive 
participle of ddelussd, old verb, in N.T. only here and Rom. 
2:22, common in LXX, to pollute (Ex. 5:21). Those who 
have become defiled by the impurities of emperor-worship 
(7:4f.; 21:27; Rom. 2:22; Titus 1:16). Murderers (phoneu- 
sin). As a matter of course and all too common always 
(Mark 7:21; Rom. 1:29; Rev. 9:21). Fornicators (pornos). 
Again all too common always, then and now (I Cor. 5:10; 
I Tim. 1:9f.). These two crimes often go together. Sorcer- 
ers (pharmakois). Old word, in N.T. only here and 22:15. 
Closely connected with idolatry and magic (9:21; 13:13f.). 
Idolaters (eidélolatrais). See 1 Cor. §:10f.; 10:7; Eph. 5:5; 
Rey. 22:15. With a powerful grip on men’s lives then and 
now. All liars (pasi tois pseudesin). Repeated in 22:15 


470 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


and stigmatized often (2:2; 3:9; 14:5; 21:8, 27; 22:15). Not 
a “light” sin. 

g. One of the seven angels (heis ek ton hepta aggelon). As 
in 17:1 with the same introduction when the angel made 
the announcement about the harlot city (Babylon), so here 
the description of the heavenly city, the New Jerusalem, is 
given by one of the same group of angels who had the seven 
bowls. Thus the numphé (Bride) is placed in sharp con- 
trast with the porné (Harlot). The New Jerusalem was 
briefly presented in verse 2, but now is pictured at length 
(21:9-22:5) in a nearer and clearer vision. The bride the 
wife of the Lamb (tén numphén ten gunaika tou arniou). 
Twice already the metaphor of the Bride has been used 
(19:7; 21:2), here termed “‘wife” (gunaika), mentioned pro- 
leptically as in 19:7 if the marriage is not yet a reality. For 
the use of the same metaphor elsewhere in the N.T. see on 
19:7. 

10. He carried me away in the Spirit (apénegken me en 
pneumati). See same language in 17:7 when John received 
a vision of the Harlot City in a wilderness. Here it is “to 
a mountain great and high” (epi oros mega kai hupsélon). 
So it was with Ezekiel (40:2) and so the devil took Jesus 
(Matt. 4:8). It was apparently not Mount Zion (14:1), 
for the New Jerusalem is seen from this mountain. ‘The 
Seer is carried thither ‘in spirit’ (cf. 1:10; 4:1); the Angel’s 
deuro is a sursum cor to which his spirit under the influence ~ 
of the ‘Spirit of revelation’ (Eph. 1:17) at once responds” 
(Swete). And he shewed me (kai edeixen moi). First aorist 
active indicative of deiknumi, just as he had said he would 
do in verse 9 (deixd soi, I will shew thee). Precisely the 
same words about Jerusalem as in verse 2, save the absence 
of kainén (New). 

11. Having the glory of God (echousan tén doxan tou theou). 
Syntactically this clause goes with verse 10, the feminine 
accusative singular participle echousan agreeing with po/in, 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 47 


the radiance of the dazzling splendour of God as seen in 
Is. 60:1; Ezek. 43:5. God’s very presence is in the Holy 
City (the Bride). Light (phdstér). “Luminary,” late word 
(in LXX, papyri), in N.T. only here and Phil. 2:15. Christ 
is the light (pAds) of the world (John 8:12) and so are Chris- 
tians (Matt. 5:14) who have received the illumination 
(photismos) of God in the face of Christ (II Cor. 4:6) and 
who radiate it to men (Phil. 2:15). See both words in Gen. 
1:3, 14. “The ‘luminary’ of the Holy City is her witness 
to Christ” (Swete). Like unto a stone most precious (homoios 
lith0i timidtatoi). Associative instrumental case after homoi- 
os. Timtdtatoi is the elative superlative. As it were a- 
jasper stone (hos lithoi iaspidi). As in 4:3, which see. Clear 
as crystal (krustallizonti). Verb not found elsewhere from 
krustallos (old word, 4:6; 22:1), ‘‘of crystalline brightness 
and transparency” (Thayer), “transparent and gleaming as 
rock-crystal”’ (Moffatt). 

12. Having a wall great and high (echousa teichos mega kai 
hupsélon). John returns, after the parenthesis in verse 11, 
to the structure in verse 10, only to use the accusative 
echousan as before to agree with po/in, but the nominative 
echousa as again with “twelve gates” (pulonas dodeka). 
Pulon is an old word (from pu/é gate) for a large gate as in 
Luke 16:20 and six times in Rev. for the gate tower of a 
city wall (21:12, 13, 15, 21, 25; 22:14) as in I Kings 17:10; 
Acts 14:13. See Ezek. 48:31ff. for these twelve gates, one 
for each tribe (cf. Rev. 7:1-8). At the gates (epi tois pulosin). 
“Upon the gate towers.” Twelve angels (aggelous dodeka). 
As puloroi or phulakes according to Is. 62:6; II Chron. 8:14. 
Names written thereon (onomata epigegrammena). Perfect 
passive participle of epigraphd. Which are the names (ha 
estin). Just as in Ezekiel’s vision (48:31ff.), so here the 
names of the twelve tribes of Israel appear, one on each 

ate. 
r 13. Three gates (pulones treis) on each of the four sides 


472 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


as in Ezek. 42:16ff.; “on the east” (apo anatolés, as in 
16:12, starting from the east), “‘on the north” (apo dorra, 
from the north, as in Luke 13:29), ‘“‘on the south” (apo 
notou, from the south, as in Luke 13:29), “on the west” 
(apo dusmon, from the west, as in Matt. 8:11). 

14. Had (echon). Masculine present active participle of 
echo instead of echon (neuter like to teichos), and the par- 
ticiple occurs independently as if a principal verb (eichen) as 
often in this book. Twelve foundations (themelious dodeka). 
Foundation stones, old adjective (from thema, from tithémi), 
here as in I Cor. 3:11ff. and II Tim. 2:19, with /ithous (stones 
understood), though often neuter substantive to themelion 
(Luke 6:48f.; Acts 16:26). See Is. 28:16; Heb. 11:10. 
Twelve because of the twelve apostles as foundation stones 
(Eph. 2:20). On them (ep’ auton). On the twelve founda- 
tion stones. Names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (ono- 
mata ton dodeka apostolon tou arniou). Jesus had spoken of 
twelve thrones for the apostles (Matt. 19:28); names of all 
twelve are here written, not just that of Peter, as some would 
argue from Matt. 16:18. As a matter of fact, Christ is the 
corner stone or akrogoniaion (I Pet. 2:6; I Cor. 3:10; Eph. 
2:20), though rejected by the Sanhedrin (Matt. 21:42ff.). 
One may wonder if the name of Judas is on that stone or 
that of Matthias. 

15. Had (eichen). Regular imperfect here, no longer 
echon. For a measure a golden reed (metron kalamon chrusoun).. 
See 11:1 for kalamos (reed). Metron is an old word, kin to 
méter (mother, moulder, manager), an instrument for measur- 
ing (metred) as in Matt. 7:2, here in the predicate accusative. 
To measure (hina metrései). Purpose clause with Aina and 
the first aorist active subjunctive of metred. The rod of 
gold was in keeping with the dignity of the service of God 
(x22 5155857803 hageTGs Ne vay 

16. Lieth foursquare (tetragonos keitai). Present middle 
indicative of keimai. The predicate adjective is from tetra 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 473 


(olic for tessares four) and gonos (gonia corner, Matt. 6:5) 
here only in N.T. As in Ezek. 48:16, 20. It is a tetragon 
or quadrilateral quadrangle (21:12f.). The length thereof is as 
great as the breadth (to mékos autés hoson to platos). It is 
rectangular, both walls and city within. Babylon, according 
to Herodotus, was a square, each side being 120 stadia. 
Diodorus Siculus says that Nineveh was also foursquare. 
With the reed (toi kalaméi). Instrumental case (cf. verse 15 
for kalamos) and for metred (aorist active indicative here). 
Twelve thousand furlongs (epi stadion dideka chiliadon). This 
use of the genitive stadién with epi is probably correct (read- 
ing of Aleph P), though A Q have stadious (more usual, but - 
confusing here with chiliadon). Thucydides and Xenophon 
use epi with the genitive in a like idiom (in the matter of). 
It is not clear whether the 1500 miles (12,000 furlongs) is 
the measurement of each of the four sides or the sum total. 
Some of the rabbis argued that the walls of the New Jeru- 
salem of Ezekiel would reach to Damascus and the height 
would be 1500 miles high. Egual (isa). That is, it is a 
perfect cube like the Holy of Holies in Solomon’s temple 
(I Kings 6:19f.). This same measurement (platos, mékos, 
hupsos) is applied to Christ’s love in Eph. 3:18, with dathos 
(depth) added. It is useless to try to reduce the measure- 
ments or to put literal interpretations upon this highly 
wrought symbolic language. Surely the meaning is that 
heaven will be large enough for all, as Jesus said (John 
14:1ff.) without insisting on the materialistic measurement 
of a gorgeous apartment house full of inside rooms. 

17. 4 hundred and forty and four cubits (hekaton tessera- 
konta tessaron pechon). Another multiple of 12 (12X12= 
144) as in 7:4; 14:1. It is not clear whether it is the height 
or the breadth of the wall that is meant, though hupsos 
(height) comes just before. That would be 216 feet high 
(cf. verse 12), not enormous in comparison with the 7,000,000 
feet (1500 miles) height of the city. According to the measure 


474 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


of a man, that is, of an angel (metron anthropou, ho estin 
aggelou). No preposition for “according to,” just the accu- 
sative case of general reference in apposition with the verb 
emetrésen. ‘Though measured by an angel, a human stand- 
ard was employed, man’s measure which is angel’s (Bengel). 

18. The building of the wall (hé endomésis tou teichous). 
Or endomésis, elsewhere so far only in Josephus (At. XV. 9.6, 
a mole or breakwater) and in an inscription (Sy//. 583%), 
apparently from endomeo, to build in, and so the fact of 
building in. The wall had jasper (verse 11) built into it. 
Was pure gold (chrusion katharon). No copula én (was) 
expressed. The city shone like a mass of gold in contrast 
with the jasper lustre of the wall. Pure glass (hual0i katharoi). 
Associative instrumental case after homoion. Hualos (ap- 
parently from wei, it rains, and so raindrop) in N.T. only 
Rev. 21:18, 21. 

19. Were adorned (kekosmémenot). Perfect passive par- 
ticiple of kosmed as in verse 2, but without the copula ésan 
(were), followed by instrumental case /ithdi (stone). With 
all manner of precious stones (panti lithoi timioi). “With 
every precious stone.” The list of the twelve stones in 
verses Ig and 20 has no necessary mystical meaning. 
“The writer is simply trying to convey the impression of a 
radiant and superb structure” (Moffatt). The twelve gems 
do correspond closely (only eight in common) with. the 
twelve stones on the high priest’s breastplate (Ex. 28:17-20; 
39:10ff.; Ezek. 28:13; Is. 54:11f.). Charles identifies them 
with the signs of zodiac in reverse order, a needless perform- 
ance here. See the stones in Rev..4:3. These foundation 
stones are visible. For jasper (iaspis) see 4:33 21:11, 18; 
Is. 54:12; sapphire (sappheiros) see Ex. 24:10; Is. 54:11 
(possibly the /apis lazuli of Turkestan); chalcedony (chalké- 
don) we have no other reference in N.T. or LXX (described 
by Pliny, H.N. XXXIII.21), possibly a green silicate of 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 475 


copper from near Chalcedon; emerald (smaragdos) here only 
in N.T., see 4:3 smaragdinos, and like it a green stone. 

20. Sardonyx (sardonux), here only in N.T., white with 
layers of red, from sardion (red carnelian) and onyx (white); 
for sardius (sardion) see 4:3; chrysolite (chrusolithos), here only 
in N.T. (Ex. 28:20), stone of a golden colour like our topaz 
or amber or a yellow beryl or golden jasper; beryl (dérullos), 
again here only in N.T. (Ex. 28:20), note the difficulty of 
identification, much like the emerald according to Pliny; 
for topaz (topazion), here only in N.T. (Ex. 28:17), a golden- 
greenish stone; chrysoprase (chrusoprasos), here only in 
N.T. (not in LXX), in colour like a teek, translucent golden- 
green; jacinth (Auakinthos), of the colour of the hyacinth, 
a violet colour (Pliny), already in 9:17 like blue smoke, like 
achates in LXX; amethyst (amethustos), only here in N.T. 
(Ex. 28:19), of a violet and purple colour, more brilliant 
than the huakinthos. Swete sums up the colours thus: blue 
(sapphire, jacinth, amethyst), green (jasper, chalcedony, 
emerald, beryl, topaz, chrysoprase), red (sardonyx, sardius), 
yellow (chrysolite). But even so there is great variety in 
hue and brilliancy and in the reaction on each other. Clement 
of Alexandria argues that this variety illustrates the variety 
of gifts and graces in the twelve apostles. Possibly so. 

21. Twelve pearls (dodeka margaritai). These gate towers 
(pulones) were mentioned in verses 12f. Each of these (cf. 
Is. 54:12) is a pearl, one of the commonest of jewels (Matt. 
7:6; 13:46; I Tim. 2:9). Each one (ana heis hekastos). Dis- 
tributive use of ava, but with the nominative (used as ad- 
verb, not preposition) rather than the accusative (as a 
preposition) as appears also in Mark 14:19; John 8:9; with 
kata in Rom. 12:5, “a barbaric construction” according to 
Charles. Street (plateia). For which word (broad way, 
hodos understood) see Matt. 6:5, here the singular, but in- 
cludes all the streets. Transparent (diaugés). Old word 


476 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(from dia, through, augé, ray, shining through), here alone 
in N.T. 

22. I saw no temple therein (naon ouk eidon en autéi). 
“Temple I did not see in it.” The whole city is a temple in 
one sense (verse 16), but it is something more than a temple 
even with its sanctuary and Shekinah Glory in the Holy of 
Holies. For the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb are 
the temple thereof (ho gar Kurios ho theos ho pantokrator, 
naos autés estin kai to arnion). “For the Lord God, the 
Almighty, is the sanctuary of it and the Lamb.” The 
Eternal Presence is the Shekinah Glory of God (verse 3). 
In II Cor. 6:16 we are the sanctuary of God here, but now 
God is our Sanctuary, and so is the Lamb as in chapters 
4and 5. See 1:8 and often for the description of God here. 

23. To shine upon it (hina phainosin autéi). Purpose 
clause with Aina and the present active subjunctive of 
phainé, to keep on shining. Light is always a problem in 
our cities. See Is. 60:19ff. Did lighten it (ephotisen autéen). 
First aorist active indicative of phdtizd, to illumine, old verb 
from phos (Luke 11:36). If the sun and moon did shine, 
they would give no added light in the presence of the 
Shekinah Glory of God. See verse 11 for “the glory of 
God.” Cf. 18:1 and 21:3. “‘Their splendour is simply put 
to shame by the glory of God Himself” (Charles). And the 
lamp thereof is the Lamb (kai ho luchnos autés to arnion). 
Charles takes ho /uchnos as predicate, ‘“‘and the Lamb is the 
lamp thereof.” Bousset thinks that John means to com- 
pare Christ to the moon the lesser light (Gen. 1:16), but 
that contrast is not necessary. Swete sees Christ as the one 
lamp for all in contrast with the many /uchniai of the 
churches on earth (1:12, 20). ‘“‘No words could more clearly 
demonstrate the purely spiritual character of St. John’s 
conception of the New Jerusalem” (Swete). 

24. Amidst the light thereof (dia tou photos autés). Rather 
*by the light thereof.” From Is. 60:3, 11, 20. All the 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 477 


moral and spiritual progress of moderns is due to Christ, 
and the nations of earth will be represented, including “the 
kings” (hoi basileis), mentioned also in Isaiah 60:3, ‘““do 
bring their glory into it” (pherousin tén doxan auion eis 
autén). Present active indicative of pherd. Swete is un- 
certain whether this is a picture of heaven itself or “some 
gracious purpose of God towards humanity which has not 
yet been revealed” and he cites 22:2 in illustration. The 
picture is beautiful and glorious even if not realized here, 
but only in heaven. 

25. Shall in no wise be shut (ou mé kleisthosin). Double 
negative with the first aorist passive subjunctive of kei. - 
By day (hémeras). Genitive of time. Mentioned alone 
without nuktos (by night), “for there shall be no night 
there” (nux gar ouk estai ekei). This looks like a continued 
picture of heaven. 

26. They shall bring (oisousin). Future active indicative 
of pherd. Rome gathered the merchandise of the world 
(18:11ff.). The City of God will have the best of all the 
nations (Is. 60:5, 11), an expansion of verse 24. 

27. There shall in no wise enter into it (ou mé eiselthéi eis 
auten). Double negative again with the second aorist ac- 
tive subjunctive of eiserchomai with eis repeated. Like Is. 
52:1 and Ezek. 44:9. Anything unclean (pan koinon). Com- 
mon use of pan with negative like ouden, and the use of 
koinos for defiled or profane as in Mark 7:2; Acts 10:14, 
not just what is common to all (Titus 1:4). Or he that (kai 
ho). “And he that.” Maketh an abomination and a lie 
(poidn bdelugma kai pseudos). Like Babylon (17:4 which 
see for bdelugma) and 21:8 for those in the lake of fire and 
brimstone, and 22:15 for “every one loving and doing a 
lie.” These recurrent glimpses of pagan life on earth and 
of hell in contrast to heaven in this picture raise the ques- 
tion already mentioned whether John is just running par- 
allel pictures of heaven and hell after the judgment or 


478 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


whether, as Charles says: “The unclean and the abominable 
and the liars are still on earth, but, though the gates are 
open day and night, they cannot enter.” In apocalyptic 
writing literalism and chronology cannot be insisted on as 
in ordinary books. The series of panoramas continue to the 
end. But only they which are written (ei mé hoi gegram- 
menoi). “Except those written.” For “the book of life”

of life) see 7:17; 21:6; 22:17; John 4:14. There was a river 
in the Garden of Eden (Gen. 2:10). The metaphor of river 
reappears in Zech. 14:8; Ezek. 47:9, and the fountain of life 
in Joel 3:18; Jer. 2:13; Prov. ro:11; Deny yor 4227 a oe, 
Ps. 36:10. Bright as crystal (lampron hos krustallon). See 
4:6 for krustallon and 15:6; 19:8; 22:16 for lampron. “Spark- 
ling like rock crystal” (Swete), shimmering like mountain 
water over the rocks. Proceeding out of the throne of God 
and of the Lamb (ekporeuomenon ek tou thronou tou theou 
kai tou arniou). Cf. Ezek. 47:1; Zech. 14:8. Already in 
3:21 Christ is pictured as sharing the Father’s throne as in 
Heb. 1:3. See also 22:3. This phrase has no bearing on 
the doctrine of the Procession of the Holy Spirit. 

2. In the midst of the street thereof (en mesoi tés plateias 
autes). Connected probably with the river in verse 1, though 
many connect it with verse 2. Only one street mentioned 
here as in 21:21. On this side of the river and on that (tou 
potamou enteuthen kai ekeithen). Enteuthen occurs as a 
preposition in Daniel 12:5 (Theodoret) and may be so here 
(post-positive), purely adverbial in John 19:18. The tree 
of life («ulon z0és). For the metaphor see Gen. 1:11f. and 
Rev. 2:7; 22:14. Xulon is used for a green tree in Luke 
23:31; Ezek. 47:12. Bearing (poioun). Neuter active par- 
ticiple of poied (making, producing, as in Matt. 7:17). Some 
MSS. have poidn (masculine), though xu/on is neuter. Twelve 
manner of fruits (karpous dodeka). “Twelve fruits.” Yield- 
ing (apodidoun). Neuter active participle of apodidomi, to 

479 


480 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


give back, but some MSS. have apodidous (masculine) like 
poison. For the healing of the nations (eis therapeian ton 
ethnon). Spiritual healing, of course, as leaves (phulla) are 
often used for obtaining medicines. Here again the prob- 
lem occurs whether this picture is heaven before the judg- 
ment or afterwards. Charles distinguishes sharply between 
the Heavenly City for the millennial reign and the New 
Jerusalem that descends from heaven after the judgment. 
Charles rearranges these chapters to suit his theory. But 
chronology is precarious here. 

3. There shall be no curse any more (pan katathema ouk 
estai eti). No other example of katathema has been found 
outside of the Didache XVI. 5, though the verb katathe- 
matizd occurs in Matt. 26:74, meaning to curse, while we 
have anathematizo in Mark 14:71 in the same sense. It 
may be a syncopated form of katanathema. ‘The usual ana- 
thema (curse) occurs in I Cor. 16:22; Gal. 1:8; Rom. 9:3. 
For pan with ouk =ouden see 21:27. Shall do him service 
(Jatreusousin autoi). Future active of Jatreud, linear idea, 
“shall keep on serving.” See 7:15 for present active in- 
dicative of this same verb with the dative autdi as here, 
picturing the worship of God in heaven. See 27:1 for “the 
throne of God and of the Lamb.” 

4. They shall see his face (opsontai to prosdpon autou). 
Future active of Aorad. This vision of God was withheld 
from Moses (Ex. 33:20, 23), but promised by Jesus to the. 
pure in heart (Matt. 5:8) and mentioned in Heb. 12:14 as 
possible only to the holy, and promised in Ps. 17:15. Even 
here on earth we can see God in the face of Christ (II Cor. 
4:6), but now in the New Jerusalem we can see Christ face 
to face (I Cor. 13:12), even as he is after we are made really 
like him (II Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29; I John 3:2). It is an- 
thropomorphic language, to be sure, but it touches the es- 
sential reality of religion. ‘The supreme felicity is reached, 
immediate presence with God and the Lamb” (Beckwith). 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 481 


His name on their foreheads (to onoma autou epi ton metopon 
auton). As in 3:12; 7:3; 14:1. 

5. Shall be night no more (nux ouk estai eti). As in 21:25. 
They need (echousin chreian). Present active indicative, 
“They have need,” though A has hexousin (shall have), 
future like estai. Here again there is repetition of part of 
21:23, but for the purpose of showing the delightsomeness 
of the New Jerusalem with no need of lamp or sun (change 
to phos with héliou instead of photos, “they have no light 
of sun”). Shall give them light (photisei). Future active of 
photizd, while aorist ephdtisen in 21:23. They shail reign 
(Zasileusousin). Future active of basileus. Reign eternally 
in contrast with the limited millennial reign of 20:4, 6. 
This glorious eternal reign with Christ occurs repeatedly in 
the book (1:6; 3:21; 5:10) as in Luke 22:30. Christ’s King- 
dom is spiritual (John 18:36f.). “The visions of the Apoca- 
lypse are now ended; they have reached their climax in the 
New Jerusalem” (Swete). Now John gives the parting 
utterances of some of the speakers, and it is not always 
clear who is speaking. 

6. He said unto me (eipen moi). Apparently the same 
angel as in 22:1 (21:9, 15). These words (houtoi hoi logoi). 
The same words used in 21:5 by the angel there. Whatever 
the application there, here the angel seems to endorse as 
“faithful and true” (pistoi kai aléthinoi) not merely the 
preceding vision (21:9-22:5), but the revelations of the 
entire book. The language added proves this: ‘‘Sent his 
angel to shew unto his servants the things which must 
shortly come to pass” (apesteilen ton aggelon autou deixat 
tc1s doulois autou ha dei genesthai en tachei), a direct refer- 
ence to I:I concerning the purpose of Christ’s revelation to 
John in this book. For “the God of the spirits of the 
prophets” (ho theos ton pneumaton ton prophéton) see 19:10 
and I Cor. 14:32. Probably the prophets’ own spirits en- 
lightened by the Holy Spirit (10:7; 11:8; 22:9). 


482 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


7. And behold, I come quickly (kai idou erchomai tachu). 
Christ is the speaker, either through this angel or more 
probably directly from Christ without introduction as in 
verses 12, 16. About Christ coming quickly see 2:5, 16; 
3:11; 16:15, and already in 1:2f. Once more we must re- 
call that tachu and en tachei are according to God’s time, 
not ours (II Pet. 3:8). Blessed (makarios). This beatitude 
is like in substance the first (1:3) and is in Christ’s own 
words like the one in 16:15. This book is here called a 
“prophecy” (prophéteias) as in verses 10, 18, Ig. It is 
Christ’s revelation from God, a direct message from God. 
Part of it is prediction of doom on Christ’s enemies, but 
most of it is a comforting picture of final triumph and bliss 
for the faithful in a time of great distress and persecution. 

8. And I Fohn (Kdgo Idannés). Here John the Seer is 
the speaker. He had already given his name (1:1, 4, 9). 
Here he claims to be the “one who hears and sees these 
things” (ho akouon kai blepon tauta). I fell down to worship 
(epesa proskunésai). Second aorist active indicative of pipto 
(with -a form) and the first aorist active infinitive of pur- 
pose of proskuneo. It was a natural, though a wrong, thing 
to do, especially after Christ’s own voice followed that of 
the angel ‘which shewed me these things” (tou deiknuontos 
tauta). Genitive singular of the articular present active 
participle of detknuod. Cf. 1:1; 4:13 17:1; 21:9f.; 22:1, 6. 

g. See thou do it not (Hora mé). The angel promptly in-. 
terposes (/egei, dramatic present). See 19:10 for discussion 
of this same phrase hora mé when John had once before 
started to worship the angel in his excitement. Here we 
have added to the words in 19:10 “‘the prophets (ton pro- 
phéton) and also “them which keep the words of this book”’ 
(ton terounton tous logous tou bibliou toutou), the last a repeti- 
tion from 22:7. In both places we have “‘ Worship God” 
(toi thedi proskunéson}. And not an angel. 

10. And he saith unto me (kai legei moi). The angel re- 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 483 


sumes asin 19:9. Seal not up (mé sphragiséis). Prohibition 
with mé and the ingressive first aorist active subjunctive of 
sphragizo. Charles takes this to be the command of Christ 
because in verses 7 and 18 “the words of the prophecy of 
this book” come from Christ. But that is not a conclusive 
argument, though Charles, as already stated, rearranges 
these chapters to suit his own notion. Once only (10:4) was 
John directed to seal and not to write. See there for dis- 
cussion of sphragizd. This book is to be left open for all 
to read (1:3; 13:18; 17:9; 22:7, 18). dt hand (eggus). 
As in 1:3. 

11. Let him do unrighteousness still (adikésato eti). First 
aorist (constative) active imperative of adiked, viewed here 
as a whole. The language is probably ironical, with a re- 
minder of Dan. 12:10, in no sense a commendation of their 
lost estate. Charles rejects this verse as not like John. It 
is the hopelessness of the final state of the wicked which is 
here pictured. So as to “Let him be made filthy still” 
(rupanthéto eti). First aorist (constative) passive impera- 
tive of rupaind, old verb, to make foul or filthy (from rupos, 
filth, I Pet. 3:21, as is ruparos, filthy), here only in N.T. 
The use of efi is not perfectly clear, whether “still” or “yet 
more.” It is the time when Christ has shut the door to 
those outside who are now without hope (Matt. 25:10; Luke 
13:25). Ruparos occurs elsewhere in N.T. only in James 
2:2, and ruparia (filthiness) only in James 1:21. So then 
“the righteous” (ho dikaios) is to do righteousness still 
(dikaiosunén poiésato eti, first constative aorist active im- 
perative of poied) and “‘the holy” (ho hagios) to be made 
holy still (Aagiasthéto eti, first constative aorist passive im- 
perative of hagiazo). The states of both the evil and the 
good are now fixed forever. There is no word here about a 
“second chance” hereafter. 

12. My reward is with me (ho misthos mou met’ emou). 
It is Christ speaking again and he repeats his promise of 


484 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


coming quickly as in verse 7. He speaks now as the Re- 
warder (ho misthapodotés) of Heb. 11:6. Cf. Rev. 11:18; Is. 
40:10; 62:11. To render (apodounai). Second aorist active 
infinitive of purpose of apodididmi, to give back. Each will 
receive the reward according to his own work (Rev. 2:23; 
II Cor. 5:10; Rom. 2:26). 

13. I am the Alpha and the Omega (Ego to Alpha kai to O). 
Applied to God in 1:8; 21:6, and here alone to Christ, 
crowning proof in this book of Christ’s deity. So in 21:6 
God is termed, as Christ is here, A@ arché kai to telos (the 
beginning and the end), while ho protos kai ho eschatos (the 
first and the last) is applied only to Christ (1:17; 2:8). 
Solemn assurance is thus given that Christ is qualified to 
be the Judge of verse 12 (cf. Matt. 25:31-46). In Heb. 12:2 
Jesus is the archégos kai teleiotés t@s pisteds (the author and 
finisher of faith). Christ was the Creator of the universe 
for the Father. So now he is the Consummation of redemp- 
tion. 

14. Blessed (makarioi). This is the last beatitude of the 
book and “deals with the issues of the higher life’ (Swete). 
They that wash their robes (hoi plunontes tas stolas auton). 
Present active articular participle of plund. See 7:14 for 
this very verb with sto/as, while in 3:4 the negative statement 
occurs. Cf. I Cor. 6:11. That they may have the right (hina 
estat hé exousia auton). Purpose clause with hina and the 
future middle of eimi (a common construction in this book, 
6:4, II; 9:5, 20; 13:12; 14:13), ‘‘that there may be their 
right.” To come to the tree of life (epi to xulon tés 208s). 
“Over the tree of life.”” On exousia epi =“ power over” see 
6:8; 13:7; 16:9; Luke g:1. On “the tree of life” see 2:7; 
22:2. May enter in (eiselthosin). Purpose clause with hina 
and the second aorist active subjunctive of eiserchomai par- 
allel with hina estai (future). By the gates (tois puldsin). 
Associative instrumental case of pulon (21:12), “‘by the gate 
towers.” 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 485 


15. Without (exo). Outside the holy city, with which com- 
pare 21:8, 27. Diuistierdieck supplies an imperative: “Out, 
ye dogs.” The dogs (hoi kunes). Not literal dogs, but the 
morally impure (Deut. 23:18; II Kings 8:13; Ps. 22:17, 21; 
Matt. 7:6; Mark 7:27; Phil. 3:3). Dogs in the Oriental 
cities are the scavengers and excite unspeakable contempt. 
The sorcerers (hoi pharmakoi). As in 21:8, where are listed 
“the fornicators and the murderers and the idolaters,” all 
“outside” the holy city here as there “in the lake that 
burns with fire and brimstone, the second death.” Both are 
pictures (symbolic language) of hell, the eternal absence 
from fellowship with God. Another time Jesus spoke of 
“the outer darkness” (eis to skotos to exdteron, Matt. 8:12; 
22:13; 25:30), outside of lighted house, as the abode of the 
damned. Another symbol is the worm that dies not (Mark 
9:48). Every one that loveth and maketh a lie (pas philon kai 
potion pseudos). An interpretation of pasin tois pseudesin 
(all liars) of 21:8 and of poidn pseudos (doing a lie) of 21:27. 
Satan is the father of lying (John 8:44) and Satan’s home 
is a congenial place for those who love and practise lying 
(II Thess. 2:12). See I John 1:6 for not doing the truth and 
see also Rom. 1:25; Eph. 4:25. 

16. I Fesus (Ego [ésous). The last and most solemn at- 
testation to the book that from Jesus (the historic Jesus 
known to the churches), in harmony with 1:1f. Have sent 
(epempsa). First aorist active indicative of pempo, used 
here in the same sense as aposteilas in 1:1 as his personal 
messenger. It is the Jesus of history here speaking, who 
is also the Christ of theology and the Lamb of God. For 
the churches (epi tais ekklésiais). For this use of epi see 
10:11; John 12:16. It is not just for the seven churches 
(1:4), but for all the churches in the world then and now. 
I am the root and the offspring of David (Ego eimi hé riza 
kai to genos Daueid). See 5:5 for ‘“‘the root of David,” to 
which John now adds ¢o genos in the sense of “offspring” 


486 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(Acts 17:28f.), not of family or race (Acts 4:6; 7:13). Cf. 
Matt. 22:42-45. The bright, the morning star (ho aster ho 
lampros ho proinos). The Davidic King is called a star in 
Numb. 24:17; Luke 1:78. This “day-star” (phdsphoros) 1s 
interpreted as Christ (II Pet. 1:19). In Rev. 2:28 the phrase 
“the morning star” occurs in Christ’s words, which is here 
interpreted. Christ is the Light that was coming into the 
world (John 1:9; 8:12). 

17. The Spirit and the bride (to pneuma kai hé numphé). 
The Holy Spirit, speaking through the prophets or the Spirit 
of prophecy (2:7; 16:4; 18:24), joins with the bride (21 22), 
the people of God, in a response to the voice of Jesus just 
heard. After the picture of heaven in 22:1-5 there is in- 
tense longing (19:7) of God’s people for the consummation 
of the marriage of the Lamb and the Bride. So now “the 
prophets and the saints” (Swete) make a common plea to 
the Lord Jesus to “come” (Erchou, present middle impera- 
tive of erchomai, Come on) as he has just said twice that 
he would do (22:1, 12). The call for Christ is to be repeated 
by every hearer (40 akoudn) asin 1:3. Let him come (erches- 
tho). Change of person and this verb applied not to Christ 
as just before, but to the one who wishes to greet Christ. 
The thirsty man is bidden to come himself before it is too 
late. See 5:6 for dipsad, used for spiritual thirst, and in 
particular John 6:35 and 7:37 for one thirsting for the water 
of life (21:6; 22:1). Cf. Is. 55:1. He that will (ho thelon). 
Even if not yet eagerly thirsting. This one is welcome also. 
For this use of ¢helo see Phil. 2:13. Let him take (labeto). 
Second ingressive aorist active imperative of lamband. In 
accordance with the free promise in 21:6, “freely” (dorean) 
here as there. This gracious and wide invitation is cheering 
after the gloomy picture of the doomed and the damned. 
The warnings against the dragon and the two beasts with 
all their dreadful consequences are meant to deter men from 
falling victims to all the devil’s devices then and now. The 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 487 


door of mercy still stands wide open today, for the end has 
not yet come. The series of panoramas is over, with the 
consummation pictured as.a reality. Now we drop back to 
the standpoint before we saw the visions through John’s 
eyes. In verse 17 we hear the voice of the Spirit of God in- 
viting all who hear and see to heed and to come and drink 
of the water of life freely offered by the Lamb of God. 

18. J testify (Egé marturo). Commentators disagree keenly 
about the words in verses 18 and 19. Charles rejects them 
as an interpolation and out of harmony with the rest of the 
book. Beckwith takes them to be John’s own warning, 
drawn from Deut. 4:2 “to every man that heareth” (panti 
tot akouonti, dative of the articular present active participle 
of akoud, which compare 1:3). Swete properly holds these 
verses to be from Jesus himself, still bearing solemn witness 
to this book, with warning against wilful perversion of its 
teachings. If any man shall add (ean tis epith?i). Condi- 
tion of the third class with ean and the second aorist active 
subjunctive of epitithémi, with epi added with auta, as also 
in the conclusion epithései ep’ auton (future active). This 
warning is directed against perversions of this book, not 
about the New Testament or the Bible as a whole, though 
it may be true there also. Surely no warning was more 
needed when we consider the treatment accorded the Apoca- 
lypse, so that Dr. Robert South said that the Apocalypse 
either found one crazy or left him so. 

19. If any man shall take away (ean tis apheléi). Also 
condition of the third class with ean and second aorist ac- 
tive subjunctive of aphaired, with apo repeated both in the 
condition and in the conclusion (aphelei apo, future active 
indicative of aphaired for the more usual aphairései). Which 
are written in this book (ton gegrammenon en toi biblidi toutoi). 
Ablative neuter plural articular perfect passive participle in 
apposition with ek tou xulou tés z0es (from the tree of life) 


488 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


and ek tés poleds tes hagias (out of the holy city). Such a 
man is unworthy of his inheritance. 

20. He which testifieth (ho marturon). That is Jesus (1:2) 
who has just spoken (22:18). Yea: I come quickly (Nat, 
erchomai tachu). Affirmation again of the promise in 22:7, 
12. On Nai (Yes) see 1:7 for the Lord’s assent to the call. 
Then John expresses his absolute belief in the Lord’s prom- 
ise: “Amen: come, Lord Jesus” (4mén, erchou, Kurie I@sou). 
On Amén see 1:7. On erchou see 22:17. Note Kurie with 
Tésou. As in I Cor. 12:3; Phil. 2:11. For Paul’s confidence 
in the deity of Christ and the certainty of his second com- 
ing see Titus 2:13 and II Tim. 4:8. Marana tha (I Cor. 
16:22); 

a1. The grace of the Lord Fesus be with the saints (hé charis 
tou Kuriou I@sou meta ton hagion). John’s own benediction, 
an unusual ending for an apocalypse, but suitable for one 
meant to be read in the churches (1:3f.). Grace is Paul’s 
unvarying word in conclusion of his letters, as is true of 
Heb. 13:25. “‘The saints” or the consecrated (hot hagiot) 
is John’s constant word for believers in Christ (8:3f.; 11:18; 
13:7, 10; 14:12; 16:6; 17:6; 18:20, 24; 19:8; 20:9). It is a 
good word for the close of this marvellous picture of God’s 
gracious provision for his people in earth and heaven.

A. T. Robertson 


A. T. RoBErRTSON, professor of inter- 
pretation of the Greek New Testament: 
at Southern Baptist Theological Semi- 
nary for nearly a half century, was one 
of the most brilliant and popular Bible 
scholars of his day. 

A world-famous authority on the 
Greek New Testament, Dr. Robertson 
was a powerful preacher and lecturer, 
and a prolific writer with forty-five vol- 
umes on both popular and profound 
subjects to his credit. A Grammar of 
the Greek New Testament in the Light 
of Historical Research was his greatest 
contribution to the serious Bible stu- 
dent, but his many more concise New 
Testament interpretations have been 
equally helpful to the average Chris- 
tian. 

Among his most popular works are: 
A Harmony of the Gospels for Students 
of the Life of Christ, Paul and the In- 
tellectuals, Studies in Mark’s Gospel, 
Studies in the Epistle of James, Epochs 
in the Life of Jesus, and Epochs in the 
Life of Paul. 


Other Aids in 
New Testament Study 


JESUS AND HIS TEACHINGS 
Fred L. Fisher 


Quite aware of the views of some scholars, Dr. Fisher develops 
a strong case for the reliability of the Gospels and their portrait 
of Jesus. He compresses the teachings of Jesus into three well- 
argued chapters. 


PAUL AND HIS TEACHINGS 
Fred L. Fisher 


Revealing both his indebtedness to some New Testament 
scholars on Paul and his disagreement with others, Dr. Fisher 
provides a well-balanced interpretation of Paul, the man and 
the Christian interpreter. 


NEW TESTAMENT THEOLOGY 
Frank Stagg 


This study emphasizes the New Testament’s unity of thought 
and defines its basic concern as proclaiming the story of sal- 
vation. Dealing with various New Testament theological ques- | 
tions—Christ, salvation, the church, ordinances, eschatology, and 
others—Dr. Stagg gives fresh meaning and understanding of 
the Bible for today. 


THE NEW TESTAMENT WORLD 
H. E. Dana 


Pictures the life and world in the days of Jesus and Paul. 
Briefly sets forth the Jewish thinking and writing, the political 
parties, institutions, home life, and other pertinent aspects of 
that day. Also contains a good summary of the two great streams 
of thought during the time—Judaism and Hellenism.
