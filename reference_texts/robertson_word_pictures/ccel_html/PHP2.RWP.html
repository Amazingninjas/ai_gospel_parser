</TD></TR></TABLE>
 <HR>
<p>2:1 <B>{If}</B> <b><i>(\ei\)</i></b>. Paul uses four conditions in this verse, all of<br>
 the first class, assuming the condition to be true. <B>{Comfort}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\parakl&#275;sis\)</i></b>. Rather, "ground of appeal to you in Christ." See<br>
 <!-#-->1Co 1:10; Eph 4:1. <B>{Consolation}</B> <b><i>(\paramuthion\)</i></b>. Old word from<br>
 \paramutheomai\, persuasive address, incentive. <B>{Of love}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\agap&#275;s\)</i></b>. Objective genitive, "in love" <b><i>(undefined as in <!-#-->1Co<br>
 13)</i></b>. <B>{Fellowship}</B> <b><i>(\koin&#333;nia\)</i></b>. Partnership in the Holy Spirit<br>
 "whose first fruit is love" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 5:22)</i></b>. <B>{Any tender mercies}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\tis splagchna\)</i></b>. Common use of this word for the nobler<br>
 \viscera\ and so for the higher emotions. But \tis\ is masculine<br>
 singular and \splagchna\ is neuter plural. Lightfoot suggests an<br>
 error of an early transcriber or even of the amanuensis in<br>
 writing \ei tis\ instead of \ei tina\.<br>
 <br>
 2:2 <B>{Fulfil}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;r&#333;sate\)</i></b>. Better here, "fill full." Paul's cup<br>
 of joy will be full if the Philippians will only keep on having<br>
 unity of thought and feeling <b><i>(\to auto phron&#275;te\, present active<br>
 subjunctive, keep on thinking the same thing)</i></b>. <B>{Being of one<br>
 accord}</B> <b><i>(\sunpsuchoi\)</i></b>. Late word here for the first time, from<br>
 \sun\ and \psuch&#275;\, harmonious in soul, souls that beat together,<br>
 in tune with Christ and with each other. <B>{Of one mind}</B> <b><i>(\to hen<br>
 phronountes\)</i></b>. "Thinking the one thing." Like clocks that strike<br>
 at the same moment. Perfect intellectual telepathy. Identity of<br>
 ideas and harmony of feelings.<br>
 <br>
 2:3 <B>{Through vainglory}</B> <b><i>(\kata kenodoxian\)</i></b>. Late word, only here<br>
 in N.T., from \kenodoxos\ <b><i>(\kenos, doxa\, <!-#-->Ga 5:26, only here in<br>
 N.T.)</i></b>, empty pride. <B>{In lowliness of mind}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i<br>
 tapeinophrosun&#275;i\)</i></b>. Late and rare word. Not in O.T. or early<br>
 Greek writers. In Josephus and Epictetus in bad sense<br>
 <b><i>(pusillanimity)</i></b>. For ostentatious humility in <!-#-->Co 2:18,23. One<br>
 of the words, like \tapeinos\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 11:29)</i></b> and \tapeinophr&#333;n\<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 3:8, here alone in N.T.)</i></b> that Christianity has ennobled<br>
 and dignified <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:19)</i></b>. <B>{Better than himself}</B> <b><i>(\huperechontas<br>
 heaut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present active participle of \huperech&#333;\ in<br>
 intransitive sense to excel or surpass with the ablative,<br>
 "excelling themselves." See <!-#-->Ro 12:10.<br>
 <br>
 2:4 <B>{Looking}</B> <b><i>(\skopountes\)</i></b>. Present active participle of<br>
 \skope&#333;\ from \skopos\ <b><i>(aim, goal)</i></b>. Not keeping an eye on the<br>
 main chance for number one, but for the good of others.<br>
 <br>
 2:5 <B>{Have this mind in you}</B> <b><i>(\touto phroneite en humin\)</i></b>. "Keep<br>
 on thinking this in you which was also in Christ Jesus" <b><i>(\ho kai<br>
 en Christ&#333;i I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. What is that? Humility. Paul presents Jesus<br>
 as the supreme example of humility. He urges humility on the<br>
 Philippians as the only way to secure unity.<br>
 <br>
 2:6 <B>{Being}</B> <b><i>(\huparch&#333;n\)</i></b>. Rather, "existing," present active<br>
 participle of \huparch&#333;\. In the form of God <b><i>(\en morph&#275;i<br>
 theou\)</i></b>. \Morph&#275;\ means the essential attributes as shown in the<br>
 form. In his preincarnate state Christ possessed the attributes<br>
 of God and so appeared to those in heaven who saw him. Here is a<br>
 clear statement by Paul of the deity of Christ. <B>{A prize}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\harpagmon\)</i></b>. Predicate accusative with \h&#275;g&#275;sato\. Originally<br>
 words in \-mos\ signified the act, not the result <b><i>(\-ma\)</i></b>. The<br>
 few examples of \harpagmos\ <b><i>(Plutarch, etc.)</i></b> allow it to be<br>
 understood as equivalent to \harpagma\, like \baptismos\ and<br>
 \baptisma\. That is to say Paul means a prize to be held on to<br>
 rather than something to be won <b><i>("robbery")</i></b>. <B>{To be on an<br>
 equality with God}</B> <b><i>(\to einai isa theoi\)</i></b>. Accusative articular<br>
 infinitive object of \h&#275;g&#275;sato\, "the being equal with God"<br>
 <b><i>(associative instrumental case \the&#333;i\ after \isa\)</i></b>. \Isa\ is<br>
 adverbial use of neuter plural with \einai\ as in <!-#-->Re 21:16.<br>
 <B>{Emptied himself}</B> <b><i>(\heauton eken&#333;se\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of \keno&#333;\, old verb from \kenos\, empty. Of what did<br>
 Christ empty himself? Not of his divine nature. That was<br>
 impossible. He continued to be the Son of God. There has arisen a<br>
 great controversy on this word, a \Kenosis\ doctrine. Undoubtedly<br>
 Christ gave up his environment of glory. He took upon himself<br>
 limitations of place <b><i>(space)</i></b> and of knowledge and of power,<br>
 though still on earth retaining more of these than any mere man.<br>
 It is here that men should show restraint and modesty, though it<br>
 is hard to believe that Jesus limited himself by error of<br>
 knowledge and certainly not by error of conduct. He was without<br>
 sin, though tempted as we are. "He stripped himself of the<br>
 insignia of majesty" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:7 <B>{The form of a servant}</B> <b><i>(\morph&#275;n doulou\)</i></b>. He took the<br>
 characteristic attributes <b><i>(\morph&#275;n\ as in verse <!-#-->6)</i></b> of a slave.<br>
 His humanity was as real as his deity. <B>{In the likeness of men}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\en homoi&#333;mati anthr&#333;p&#333;n\)</i></b>. It was a likeness, but a real<br>
 likeness <b><i>(Kennedy)</i></b>, no mere phantom humanity as the Docetic<br>
 Gnostics held. Note the difference in tense between \huparch&#333;n\<br>
 <b><i>(eternal existence in the \morph&#275;\ of God)</i></b> and \genomenos\<br>
 <b><i>(second aorist middle participle of \ginomai\, becoming, definite<br>
 entrance in time upon his humanity)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:8 <B>{In fashion}</B> <b><i>(\sch&#275;mati\)</i></b>. Locative case of \sch&#275;ma\, from<br>
 \ech&#333;\, to have, to hold. Bengel explains \morph&#275;\ by _forma_,<br>
 \homoi&#333;ma\ by _similitudo_, \sch&#275;ma\ by _habitus_. Here with<br>
 \sch&#275;ma\ the contrast "is between what He is in Himself, and what<br>
 He _appeared_ in the eyes of men" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. <B>{He humbled<br>
 himself}</B> <b><i>(\etapein&#333;sen heauton\)</i></b>. First aorist active of<br>
 \tapeino&#333;\, old verb from \tapeinos\. It is a voluntary<br>
 humiliation on the part of Christ and for this reason Paul is<br>
 pressing the example of Christ upon the Philippians, this supreme<br>
 example of renunciation. See Bruce's masterpiece, _The<br>
 Humiliation of Christ_. <B>{Obedient}</B> <b><i>(\hup&#275;koos\)</i></b>. Old adjective,<br>
 giving ear to. See <!-#-->Ac 7:39; 2Co 2:9. <B>{Unto death}</B> <b><i>(\mechri<br>
 thanatou\)</i></b>. "Until death." See "until blood" <b><i>(\mechris haimatos\,<br>
 <!-#-->Heb 12:4)</i></b>. <B>{Yea, the death of the cross}</B> <b><i>(\thanatou de<br>
 staurou\)</i></b>. The bottom rung in the ladder from the Throne of God.<br>
 Jesus came all the way down to the most despised death of all, a<br>
 condemned criminal on the accursed cross.<br>
 <br>
 2:9 <B>{Wherefore}</B> <b><i>(\dio\)</i></b>. Because of which act of voluntary and<br>
 supreme humility. <B>{Highly exalted}</B> <b><i>(\huperups&#333;se\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 indicative of \huperupso&#333;\ <b><i>(\huper\ and \hupsos\)</i></b> late and rare<br>
 word <b><i>(LXX and Byzantine)</i></b>. Here only in N.T. Because of Christ's<br>
 voluntary humiliation God lifted him above or beyond <b><i>(\huper\)</i></b><br>
 the state of glory which he enjoyed before the Incarnation. What<br>
 glory did Christ have after the Ascension that he did not have<br>
 before in heaven? What did he take back to heaven that he did not<br>
 bring? Clearly his humanity. He returned to heaven the Son of Man<br>
 as well as the Son of God. <B>{The name which is above every name}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\to onoma to huper pan onoma\)</i></b>. What name is that? Apparently<br>
 and naturally the name <B>{Jesus}</B>, which is given in verse <!-#-->10.<br>
 Some think it is "Jesus Christ," some "Lord," some the ineffable<br>
 name Jehovah, some merely dignity and honour.<br>
 <br>
 2:10 <B>{That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow}</B> <b><i>(\hina en<br>
 t&#333;i onomati I&#275;sou pan gonu kamps&#275;i\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 subjunctive of \kampt&#333;\, old verb, to bend, to bow, in purpose<br>
 clause with \hina\. Not perfunctory genuflections whenever the<br>
 name of Jesus is mentioned, but universal acknowledgment of the<br>
 majesty and power of Jesus who carries his human name and nature<br>
 to heaven. This universal homage to Jesus is seen in <!-#-->Ro 8:22;<br>
 Eph 1:20-22 and in particular <!-#-->Re 5:13. <B>{Under the earth}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katachthoni&#333;n\)</i></b>. Homeric adjective for departed souls,<br>
 subterranean, simply the dead. Here only in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 2:11 <B>{Should confess}</B> <b><i>(\exomolog&#275;s&#275;tai\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 subjunctive of \exomologeomai\ with \hina\ for purpose. <B>{Lord}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Kurios\)</i></b>. Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 2:36)</i></b> claimed that God made Christ<br>
 "Lord." See also <!-#-->1Co 8:6; 12:3; Ro 10:9. Kennedy laments that<br>
 the term Lord has become one of the most lifeless in the<br>
 Christian vocabulary, whereas it really declares the true<br>
 character and dignity of Jesus Christ and "is the basis and the<br>
 object of worship."<br>
 <br>
 2:12 <B>{Not as in my presence only}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; h&#333;s en t&#275;i parousi&#257;i<br>
 monon\)</i></b>. B and a few other MSS. omit \h&#333;s\. The negative \m&#275;\<br>
 goes with the imperative \katergazesthe\ <b><i>(work out)</i></b>, not with<br>
 \hup&#275;kousate\ <b><i>(obeyed)</i></b> which would call for \ouch\. <B>{Much more}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\poll&#333;i mallon\)</i></b>. They are not to render eye-service only when<br>
 Paul is there, but much more when he is away. <B>{Work out}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katergazesthe\)</i></b>. Perfective use of \kata\ <b><i>(down)</i></b> in<br>
 composition, work on to the finish. This exhortation assumes<br>
 human free agency in the carrying on the work of one's salvation.<br>
 <B>{With fear and trembling}</B> <b><i>(\meta phobou kai tromou\)</i></b>. "Not<br>
 slavish terror, but wholesome, serious caution" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. "A<br>
 nervous and trembling anxiety to do right" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. Paul has<br>
 no sympathy with a cold and dead orthodoxy or formalism that<br>
 knows nothing of struggle and growth. He exhorts as if he were an<br>
 Arminian in addressing men. He prays as if he were a Calvinist in<br>
 addressing God and feels no inconsistency in the two attitudes.<br>
 Paul makes no attempt to reconcile divine sovereignty and human<br>
 free agency, but boldly proclaims both.<br>
 <br>
 2:13 <B>{Which worketh in you}</B> <b><i>(\ho energ&#333;n en humin\)</i></b>. Articular<br>
 present active participle of \energe&#333;\ from \energos\ <b><i>(\en,<br>
 ergon\)</i></b> one at work, common verb from Aristotle on, to be at<br>
 work, to energize. God is the Energy and the Energizer of the<br>
 universe. Modern scientists, like Eddington, Jeans, and Whitney,<br>
 are not afraid to agree with Paul and to put God back of all<br>
 activity in nature. <B>{Both to will and to work}</B> <b><i>(\kai to thelein<br>
 kai to energein\)</i></b>. "Both the willing and the working <b><i>(the<br>
 energizing)</i></b>." God does it all, then. Yes, but he puts us to work<br>
 also and our part is essential, as he has shown in verse <!-#-->12,<br>
 though secondary to that of God. <B>{For his good-pleasure}</B> <b><i>(\huper<br>
 t&#275;s eudokias\)</i></b>. So Whitney puts "the will of God" behind<br>
 gravitation and all the laws of nature.<br>
 <br>
 2:14 <B>{Without murmurings}</B> <b><i>(\ch&#333;ris goggusm&#333;n\)</i></b>. See on <!-#-->Ac 6:1<br>
 for this late onomatopoetic word from \gogguz&#333;\, to mutter, to<br>
 grumble. <B>{Disputings}</B> <b><i>(\dialogism&#333;n\)</i></b>. Or questionings as in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 24:38. The grumblings led to disputes.<br>
 <br>
 2:15 <B>{That ye may be}</B> <b><i>(\hina gen&#275;sthe\)</i></b>. Rather, "that ye may<br>
 become" <b><i>(second aorist middle subjunctive of \ginomai\, to<br>
 become)</i></b>. <B>{Blameless}</B> <b><i>(\amemptoi\)</i></b>. Free from censure<br>
 <b><i>(\memphomai\, to blame)</i></b>. <B>{Harmless}</B> <b><i>(\akeraioi\)</i></b>. Unmixed,<br>
 unadulterated as in <!-#-->Ro 16:19. <B>{Without blemish}</B> <b><i>(\am&#333;ma\)</i></b>.<br>
 Without spot, "unblemished in reputation and in reality"<br>
 <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. <B>{In the midst of}</B> <b><i>(\meson\)</i></b>. Preposition with<br>
 genitive. <B>{Crooked}</B> <b><i>(\skolias\)</i></b>. Old word, curved as opposed to<br>
 \orthos\, straight. See on &#175;Ac 2:40. <B>{Perverse}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\diestrammen&#275;s\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of \diastreph&#333;\, to<br>
 distort, to twist, to turn to one side <b><i>(\dia\, in two)</i></b>. Old word.<br>
 See <!-#-->Mt 17:17; Ac 13:10.<br>
 <br>
 2:16 <B>{As lights in the world}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s ph&#333;st&#275;res en kosm&#333;i\)</i></b>. As<br>
 luminaries like the heavenly bodies. Christians are the light of<br>
 the world <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:14)</i></b> as they reflect the light from Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 1:4; 8:12)</i></b>, but here the word is not \ph&#333;s\ <b><i>(light)</i></b>, but<br>
 \ph&#333;st&#275;res\ <b><i>(luminaries, stars)</i></b>. The place for light is the<br>
 darkness where it is needed. <B>{Holding forth}</B> <b><i>(\epechontes\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present active participle of \epech&#333;\. Probably not connected<br>
 with the preceding metaphor in \ph&#333;st&#275;res\. The old meaning of<br>
 the verb \epech&#333;\ is to hold forth or to hold out <b><i>(the word of<br>
 life as here)</i></b>. The context seems to call for "holding fast." It<br>
 occurs also with the sense of attending to <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 3:5)</i></b>. <B>{That I<br>
 may have}</B> <b><i>(\emoi\)</i></b>. Ethical dative, "to me as a ground of<br>
 boasting."<br>
 <br>
 2:17 <B>{And if I am offered}</B> <b><i>(\ei kai spendomai\)</i></b>. Though I am<br>
 poured out as a libation. Old word. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->2Ti<br>
 4:6. Paul pictures his life-blood as being poured upon<br>
 <b><i>(uncertain whether heathen or Jewish offerings meant and not<br>
 important)</i></b> the sacrifice and service of the faith of the<br>
 Philippians in mutual service and joy <b><i>(both \chair&#333;\ and<br>
 \sunchair&#333;\ twice in the sentence)</i></b>. Joy is mutual when the<br>
 service is mutual. Young missionaries offer their lives as a<br>
 challenge to other Christians to match their money with their<br>
 blood.<br>
 <br>
 2:19 <B>{That I also may be of good comfort}</B> <b><i>(\hina kag&#333; eupsuch&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present subjunctive with \hina\ in purpose clause of the late and<br>
 rare verb \eupsuche&#333;\, from \eupsuchos\ <b><i>(cheerful, of good<br>
 spirit)</i></b>. In papyri and \eupsuchei\ <b><i>(be of good cheer)</i></b> common in<br>
 sepulchral inscriptions. <B>{When I know}</B> <b><i>(\gnous\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active participle of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 2:20 <B>{Likeminded}</B> <b><i>(\isopsuchon\)</i></b>. Old, but very rare adjective<br>
 <b><i>(\isos, psuch&#275;\)</i></b>, like \isotimos\ in <!-#-->2Pe 1:1. Only here in N.T.<br>
 Likeminded with Timothy, not with Paul. <B>{Truly}</B> <b><i>(\gn&#275;si&#333;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 "Genuinely." Old adverb, only here in N.T., from \gn&#275;sios\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Php<br>
 4:3)</i></b>, legitimate birth, not spurious.<br>
 <br>
 2:21 <B>{They all}</B> <b><i>(\hoi pantes\)</i></b>. "The whole of them." Surely Luke<br>
 was away from Rome at this juncture.<br>
 <br>
 2:22 <B>{The proof}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n dokim&#275;n\)</i></b>. "The test" as of metals <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co<br>
 2:9; 9:13)</i></b>. Three times they had seen Timothy <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 16:13; 19:22;<br>
 20:3f.)</i></b>. <B>{With me}</B> <b><i>(\sun emoi\)</i></b>. Paul's delicacy of feeling made<br>
 him use \sun\ rather than \emoi\ alone. Timothy did not serve<br>
 Paul. <B>{In furtherance of}</B> <b><i>(\eis\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Php 1:5 for this use of<br>
 \eis\.<br>
 <br>
 2:23 <B>{So soon as I shall see}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s an aphid&#333;\)</i></b>. Indefinite<br>
 temporal clause with \h&#333;s an\ and the second aorist active<br>
 subjunctive of \aphora&#333;\. The oldest MSS. <b><i>(Aleph A B D)</i></b> have<br>
 \aphid&#333;\ <b><i>(old aspirated form)</i></b> rather than \apid&#333;\. <B>{How it will<br>
 go with me}</B> <b><i>(\ta peri eme\)</i></b>. On the force of \apo\ with \hora&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(look away)</i></b> see <!-#-->Heb 12:2. "The things concerning me," the<br>
 outcome of the trial. Cf. <!-#-->1Co 4:17,19.<br>
 <br>
 2:24 <B>{In the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\en Kuri&#333;i\)</i></b>. Not a perfunctory use of this<br>
 phrase. Paul's whole life is centred in Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 2:20)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:25 <B>{I counted it}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;g&#275;sam&#275;n\)</i></b>. Epistolary aorist from the<br>
 point of view of the readers. <B>{Epaphroditus}</B> <b><i>(\Epaphroditon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Common name, though only in Philippians in N.T., contracted into<br>
 Epaphras, though not the same man as Epaphras in <!-#-->Col 1:7. Note<br>
 one article \ton\ <b><i>(the)</i></b> with the three epithets given in an<br>
 ascending scale <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>, brother <b><i>(\adelphon\, common<br>
 sympathy)</i></b>, fellow-worker <b><i>(\sunergon\, common work)</i></b>,<br>
 fellow-soldier <b><i>(\sunstrati&#333;t&#275;n\, common danger as in <!-#-->Phm 1:2)</i></b>.<br>
 \Mou\ <b><i>(my)</i></b> and \hum&#333;n\ <b><i>(your)</i></b> come together in sharp contrast.<br>
 <B>{Messenger}</B> <b><i>(\apostolon\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->2Co 8:23 for this use of<br>
 \apostolos\ as messenger <b><i>(missionary)</i></b>. <B>{Minister}</B> <b><i>(\leitourgon\)</i></b>.<br>
 See on &#175;Ro 13:6; 15:16 for this ritualistic term.<br>
 <br>
 2:26 <B>{He longed after}</B> <b><i>(\epipoth&#333;n &#275;n\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect<br>
 of \epipothe&#333;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 1:8)</i></b>, "he was yearning after." <B>{You all}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pantas humas\)</i></b>. So again <b><i>(<!-#-->1:5,7,8)</i></b>. <B>{Was sore troubled}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ad&#275;mon&#333;n\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect again <b><i>(repeat \&#275;n\)</i></b> of the<br>
 old word \ad&#275;mone&#333;\ either from an unused \ad&#275;m&#333;n\ <b><i>(\a\ privative<br>
 and \d&#275;mos\, away from home, homesick)</i></b> or from \ad&#275;m&#333;n, ad&#275;sai\<br>
 <b><i>(discontent, bewilderment)</i></b>. The _Vocabulary_ of Moulton and<br>
 Milligan gives one papyrus example in line with the latter<br>
 etymology. See already <!-#-->Mt 26:37; Mr 14:33. In any case the<br>
 distress of Epaphroditus was greatly increased when he knew that<br>
 the Philippians <b><i>(the home-folks)</i></b> had learned of his illness,<br>
 "because ye had heard that he was sick" <b><i>(\dioti &#275;kousate hoti<br>
 &#275;sthen&#275;se\)</i></b>, "because ye heard that he fell sick" <b><i>(ingressive<br>
 aorist)</i></b>. <B>{He was sick}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;sthen&#275;se\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist, "he did<br>
 become sick." <B>{Nigh unto death}</B> <b><i>(\parapl&#275;sion thanat&#333;i\)</i></b>. Only<br>
 example in N.T. of this compound adverbial preposition <b><i>(from the<br>
 adjective \parapl&#275;sios\)</i></b> with the dative case.<br>
 <br>
 2:28 <B>{Ye may rejoice}</B> <b><i>(\char&#275;te\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive<br>
 subjunctive with \hina\ in final clause of \chair&#333;\, to rejoice.<br>
 <B>{That I may be the less sorrowful}</B> <b><i>(\kag&#333; alupoteros &#333;\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 subjunctive with \hina\ and comparative of old compound adjective<br>
 \alupos\ <b><i>(\a\ privative and \lup&#275;\, more free from grief)</i></b>.<br>
 Beautiful expression of Paul's feelings for the Philippians and<br>
 for Epaphroditus.<br>
 <br>
 2:29 <B>{In honour}</B> <b><i>(\entimous\)</i></b>. Old compound adjective <b><i>(\en,<br>
 tim&#275;\)</i></b>, prized, precious <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 7:2; 14:8; 1Pe 2:4,6)</i></b>. Predicate<br>
 accusative. Noble plea in behalf of Christ's minister.<br>
 <br>
 2:30 <B>{Hazarding his life}</B> <b><i>(\paraboleusamenos t&#275;i psuch&#275;i\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist middle participle of \paraboleu&#333;\ <b><i>(from the adjective<br>
 \parabolos\)</i></b>, to place beside. The old Greek writers used<br>
 \paraballomai\, to expose oneself to danger. But Deissmann<br>
 <b><i>(_Light from the Ancient East_, p. 88)</i></b> cites an example of<br>
 \paraboleusamenos\ from an inscription at Olbia or the Black Sea<br>
 of the second century A.D. where it plainly means "exposing<br>
 himself to danger" as here. Lightfoot renders it here "having<br>
 gambled with his life." The word \parabolani\ <b><i>(riskers)</i></b> was<br>
 applied to the Christians who risked their lives for the dying<br>
 and the dead.<br>
