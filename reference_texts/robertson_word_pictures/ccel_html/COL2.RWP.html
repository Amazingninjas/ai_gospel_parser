<p>2:1 <B>{How greatly I strive}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;likon ag&#333;na ech&#333;\)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 "how great a contest I am having." The old adjectival relative<br>
 \h&#275;likos\ <b><i>(like Latin _quantus_)</i></b> is used for age or size in N.T.<br>
 only here and <!-#-->Jas 3:5 <b><i>(twice, how great, how small)</i></b>. It is an<br>
 inward contest of anxiety like the \merimna\ for all the churches<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:28)</i></b>. \Ag&#333;na\ carries on the metaphor of \ag&#333;nizomenos\<br>
 in <!-#-->1:29. <B>{For them at Laodicea}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n en Laodiki&#257;i\)</i></b>. <B>{Supply}</B><br>
 \huper\ as with \huper hum&#333;n\. Paul's concern extended beyond<br>
 Colossae to Laodicea <b><i>(<!-#-->4:16)</i></b> and to Hierapolis <b><i>(<!-#-->4:13)</i></b>, the<br>
 three great cities in the Lycus Valley where Gnosticism was<br>
 beginning to do harm. Laodicea is the church described as<br>
 lukewarm in <!-#-->Re 3:14. <B>{For as many as have not seen my face}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hosoi ouch heorakan to pros&#333;pon mou\)</i></b>. The phrase undoubtedly<br>
 includes Hierapolis <b><i>(<!-#-->4:13)</i></b>, and a few late MSS. actually insert<br>
 it here. Lightfoot suggests that Hierapolis had not yet been<br>
 harmed by the Gnostics as much as Colossae and Laodicea. Perhaps<br>
 so, but the language includes all in that whole region who have<br>
 not seen Paul's face in the flesh <b><i>(that is, in person, and not in<br>
 picture)</i></b>. How precious a real picture of Paul would be to us<br>
 today. The antecedent to \hosoi\ is not expressed and it would be<br>
 \tout&#333;n\ after \huper\. The form \heorakan\ <b><i>(perfect active<br>
 indicative of \hora&#333;\ instead of the usual \he&#333;rakasin\ has two<br>
 peculiarities \o\ in Paul's Epistles <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 9:1)</i></b> instead of \&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(see <!-#-->Joh 1:18 for \he&#333;raken\)</i></b> and \-an\ by analogy in place of<br>
 \-asin\, which short form is common in the papyri. See <!-#-->Lu 9:36<br>
 \he&#333;rakan\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:2 <B>{May be comforted}</B> <b><i>(\parakl&#275;th&#333;sin\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 subjunctive of \parakale&#333;\ <b><i>(for which see <!-#-->2Co 1:3-7)</i></b> in final<br>
 clause with \hina\. <B>{Being knit together}</B> <b><i>(\sunbibasthentes\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive participle of \sunbibaz&#333;\, old verb, causal<br>
 of \bain&#333;\, to make go together, to coalesce in argument <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 16:10)</i></b>, in spiritual growth <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 2:19)</i></b>, in love as here. Love<br>
 is the \sundesmos\ <b><i>(<!-#-->3:14)</i></b> that binds all together. <B>{Unto all<br>
 riches}</B> <b><i>(\eis pan ploutos\)</i></b>. Probably some distinction intended<br>
 between \en\ <b><i>(in love as the sphere)</i></b> and \eis\ <b><i>(unto as the<br>
 goal)</i></b>. <B>{Of the full assurance of understanding}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;s<br>
 pl&#275;rophorias t&#275;s sunese&#333;s\)</i></b>. On \pl&#275;rophoria\, see <!-#-->1Th 1:5.<br>
 From \pl&#275;rophore&#333;\ <b><i>(see <!-#-->Lu 1:1)</i></b> and only in N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 1:5; Col<br>
 2:2; Heb 6:11; 10:22)</i></b>, Clement of Rome <b><i>(_Cor_. 42)</i></b> and one<br>
 papyrus example. Paul desires the full use of the intellect in<br>
 grasping the great mystery of Christ and it calls for the full<br>
 and balanced exercise of all one's mental powers. <B>{That they may<br>
 know}</B> <b><i>(\eis epign&#333;sin\)</i></b>. "Unto full knowledge." This use of<br>
 \epign&#333;sis\ <b><i>(full, additional knowledge)</i></b> is Paul's reply to the<br>
 Gnostics with the limited and perverted \gn&#333;sis\ <b><i>(knowledge)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{The mystery of God, even Christ}</B> <b><i>(\tou must&#275;riou tou theou,<br>
 Christou\)</i></b>. The MSS. differ widely here, but this is Westcott and<br>
 Hort's reading. Genitive <b><i>(objective)</i></b> with \epign&#333;sin\ and<br>
 \Christou\ in apposition. Christ is "the mystery of God," but no<br>
 longer hidden, but manifested <b><i>(<!-#-->1:26)</i></b> and meant for us to know<br>
 to the fulness of our capacity.<br>
 <br>
 2:3 <B>{In whom}</B> <b><i>(\en h&#333;i\)</i></b>. This locative form can refer to<br>
 \must&#275;riou\ or to \Christou\. It really makes no difference in<br>
 sense since Christ is the mystery of God. <B>{All the treasures of<br>
 wisdom and knowledge}</B> <b><i>(\pantes hoi th&#275;sauroi t&#275;s sophias kai<br>
 gn&#333;se&#333;s\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 2:11; 6:19-21 for this old word, our<br>
 thesaurus, for coffer, storehouse, treasure. Paul confronts these<br>
 pretentious intellectuals <b><i>(Gnostics)</i></b> with the bold claim that<br>
 Christ sums up all wisdom and knowledge. These treasures are<br>
 hidden <b><i>(\apokruphoi\, old adjective from \apokrupt&#333;\, to hide<br>
 away, <!-#-->Mr 4:22)</i></b> whether the Gnostics have discovered them or<br>
 not. They are there <b><i>(in Christ)</i></b> as every believer knows by fresh<br>
 and repeated discovery.<br>
 <br>
 2:4 <B>{This I say}</B> <b><i>(\touto leg&#333;\)</i></b>. Paul explains why he has made<br>
 this great claim for Christ at this point in his discussion. <B>{May<br>
 delude}</B> <b><i>(\paralogiz&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Present middle subjunctive of<br>
 \paralogizomai\, old verb, only here in N.T., from \para\ and<br>
 \logizomai\, to count aside and so wrong, to cheat by false<br>
 reckoning, to deceive by false reasoning <b><i>(Epictetus)</i></b>. <B>{With<br>
 persuasiveness of speech}</B> <b><i>(\en pithanologi&#257;i\)</i></b>. Rare word <b><i>(Plato)</i></b><br>
 from \pithanos\ and \logos\, speech, adapted to persuade, then<br>
 speciously leading astray. Only here in N.T. One papyrus example.<br>
 The art of persuasion is the height of oratory, but it easily<br>
 degenerates into trickery and momentary and flashy deceit such as<br>
 Paul disclaimed in <!-#-->1Co 2:4 <b><i>(\ouk en pithois sophias logois\)</i></b><br>
 where he uses the very adjective \pithos\ <b><i>(persuasive)</i></b> of which<br>
 \pithanos\ <b><i>(both from \peith&#333;\)</i></b> is another form. It is curious<br>
 how winning champions of error, like the Gnostics and modern<br>
 faddists, can be with plausibility that catches the gullible.<br>
 <br>
 2:5 <B>{Though}</B> <b><i>(\ei kai\)</i></b>. Not \kai ei\ <b><i>(even if)</i></b>. <B>{Yet}</B> <b><i>(\alla\)</i></b>.<br>
 Common use of \alla\ in the apodosis <b><i>(conclusion)</i></b> of a<br>
 conditional or concessive sentence. <B>{Your order}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n taxin\)</i></b>.<br>
 The military line <b><i>(from \tass&#333;\)</i></b>, unbroken, intact. A few<br>
 stragglers had gone over to the Gnostics, but there had been no<br>
 panic, no breach in the line. <B>{Steadfastness}</B> <b><i>(\stere&#333;ma\)</i></b>. From<br>
 \stereo&#333;\ <b><i>(from \stereos\)</i></b> to make steady, and probably the same<br>
 military metaphor as in \taxin\ just before. The solid part of<br>
 the line which can and does stand the attack of the Gnostics. See<br>
 <!-#-->Ac 16:5 where the verb \stereo&#333;\ is used with \pistis\ and <!-#-->1Pe<br>
 5:9 where the adjective \stereos\ is so used. In <!-#-->2Th 3:6,8,11<br>
 Paul speaks of his own \taxis\ <b><i>(orderly conduct)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:6 <B>{As therefore ye received}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s oun parelabete\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active indicative of \paralamban&#333;\ in same sense as in<br>
 <!-#-->1Th 4:1; Php 4:9 <b><i>(both \manthan&#333;\ and \paralamban&#333;\)</i></b> that is<br>
 like \manthan&#333;\, to learn <b><i>(<!-#-->1:7)</i></b>, from Epaphras and others.<br>
 <B>{Christ Jesus the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\ton Christon I&#275;soun ton Kurion\)</i></b>. This<br>
 peculiar phrase occurs nowhere else by Paul. We have often \ho<br>
 Christos\ <b><i>(the Christ or Messiah)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Php 1:15, \I&#275;sous<br>
 Christos\ <b><i>(Jesus Christ)</i></b>, \Christos I&#275;sous\ <b><i>(Christ Jesus)</i></b>, \ho<br>
 Kurios I&#275;sous\ <b><i>(the Lord Jesus, very often)</i></b>, but nowhere else \ho<br>
 Christos I&#275;sous\ and \I&#275;sous ho Kurios\. Hence it is plain that<br>
 Paul here meets the two forms of Gnostic heresy about the Person<br>
 of Christ <b><i>(the recognition of the historical Jesus in his actual<br>
 humanity against the Docetic Gnostics, the identity of the Christ<br>
 or Messiah with this historical Jesus against the Cerinthian<br>
 Gnostics, and the acknowledgment of him as Lord)</i></b>. "As therefore<br>
 ye received the Christ <b><i>(the Messiah)</i></b>, Jesus the Lord." Ye were<br>
 taught right. <B>{Walk in him}</B> <b><i>(\en aut&#333;i peripateite\)</i></b>. "Go on<br>
 walking in him" <b><i>(present active indicative of \peripate&#333;\)</i></b>. Stick<br>
 to your first lessons in Christ.<br>
 <br>
 2:7 <B>{Rooted}</B> <b><i>(\erriz&#333;menoi\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of old<br>
 verb \rizo&#333;\ from \riza\, root. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->Eph 3:17.<br>
 Paul changes the figure from walk to growing tree. <B>{Builded up in<br>
 him}</B> <b><i>(\epoikodomoumenoi en aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Present passive participle<br>
 <b><i>(rooted to stay so)</i></b> of \epoikodome&#333;\, old verb, to build upon as<br>
 in <!-#-->1Co 3:10,12. The metaphor is changed again to a building as<br>
 continually going up <b><i>(present tense)</i></b>. <B>{Stablished}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\bebaioumenoi\)</i></b>. Present passive participle of \bebaio&#333;\, old<br>
 verb from \bebaios\ <b><i>(from \bain&#333;, bai&#333;\)</i></b>, to make firm or stable.<br>
 <B>{In your faith}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i pistei\)</i></b>. Locative case, though the<br>
 instrumental case, <B>{by your faith}</B>, makes good sense also. <B>{Even<br>
 as ye were taught}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s edidachth&#275;te\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative of \didask&#333;\, an allusion to \parelabete\ in verse <!-#-->6<br>
 and to \emathete\ in <!-#-->1:7. <B>{In thanksgiving}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 eucharisti&#257;i\)</i></b>. Hence they had no occasion to yield to the<br>
 blandishments of the Gnostic teachers.<br>
 <br>
 2:8 <B>{Take heed}</B> <b><i>(\blepete\)</i></b>. Present active imperative second<br>
 person plural of \blep&#333;\, common verb for warning like our "look<br>
 out," "beware," "see to it." <B>{Lest there shall be any one}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;<br>
 tis estai\)</i></b>. Negative purpose with the future indicative, though<br>
 the aorist subjunctive also occurs as in <!-#-->2Co 12:6. <B>{That maketh<br>
 spoil of you}</B> <b><i>(\ho sulag&#333;g&#333;n\)</i></b>. Articular present active<br>
 participle of \sulag&#333;ge&#333;\, late and rare <b><i>(found here first)</i></b> verb<br>
 <b><i>(from \sul&#275;\, booty, and \ag&#333;\, to lead, to carry)</i></b>, to carry off<br>
 as booty a captive, slave, maiden. Only here in N.T. Note the<br>
 singular here. There was some one outstanding leader who was<br>
 doing most of the damage in leading the people astray. <B>{Through<br>
 his philosophy}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#275;s philosophias\)</i></b>. The only use of the<br>
 word in the N.T. and employed by Paul because the Gnostics were<br>
 fond of it. Old word from \philosophos\ <b><i>(\philos, sophos\, one<br>
 devoted to the pursuit of wisdom)</i></b> and in N.T. only in <!-#-->Ac 17:18.<br>
 Paul does not condemn knowledge and wisdom <b><i>(see verse <!-#-->2)</i></b>, but<br>
 only this false philosophy, "knowledge falsely named"<br>
 <b><i>(\pseud&#333;numos gn&#333;sis\, <!-#-->1Ti 6:20)</i></b>, and explained here by the<br>
 next words. <B>{And vain deceit}</B> <b><i>(\kai ken&#275;s apat&#275;s\)</i></b>. Old word for<br>
 trick, guile, like riches <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 13:22)</i></b>. Descriptive of the<br>
 philosophy of the Gnostics. <B>{Tradition}</B> <b><i>(\paradosin\)</i></b>. Old word<br>
 from \paradid&#333;mi\, a giving over, a passing on. The word is<br>
 colourless in itself. The tradition may be good <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 2:15; 3:6)</i></b><br>
 or bad <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 7:3)</i></b>. Here it is worthless and harmful, merely the<br>
 foolish theories of the Gnostics. <B>{Rudiments}</B> <b><i>(\stoicheia\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 word for anything in a \stoichos\ <b><i>(row, series)</i></b> like the letters<br>
 of the alphabet, the materials of the universe <b><i>(<!-#-->2Pe 3:10,12)</i></b>,<br>
 elementary teaching <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 5:12)</i></b>, elements of Jewish ceremonial<br>
 training <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:10; Gal 4:3,9)</i></b>, the specious arguments of the<br>
 Gnostic philosophers as here with all their aeons and rules of<br>
 life. <B>{And not after Christ}</B> <b><i>(\kai ou kata Christon\)</i></b>. Christ is<br>
 the yardstick by which to measure philosophy and all phases of<br>
 human knowledge. The Gnostics were measuring Christ by their<br>
 philosophy as many men are doing today. They have it backwards.<br>
 Christ is the measure for all human knowledge since he is the<br>
 Creator and the Sustainer of the universe.<br>
 <br>
 2:9 <B>{For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hoti en aut&#333;i katoikei p&#257;n to pl&#275;r&#333;ma t&#275;s theot&#275;tos<br>
 s&#333;matik&#333;s\)</i></b>. In this sentence, given as the reason <b><i>(\hoti\,<br>
 because)</i></b> for the preceding claim for Christ as the measure of<br>
 human knowledge Paul states the heart of his message about the<br>
 Person of Christ. There dwells <b><i>(at home)</i></b> in Christ not one or<br>
 more aspects of the Godhead <b><i>(the very \essence\ of God, from<br>
 \theos, deitas\)</i></b> and not to be confused with \theiotes\ in <!-#-->Ro<br>
 1:20 <b><i>(from \theios\, the <B>{quality}</B> of God, _divinitas_)</i></b>, here<br>
 only in N.T. as \theiot&#275;s\ only in <!-#-->Ro 1:20. The distinction is<br>
 observed in Lucian and Plutarch. \Theiot&#275;s\ occurs in the papyri<br>
 and inscriptions. Paul here asserts that "all the \pl&#275;r&#333;ma\ of<br>
 the Godhead," not just certain aspects, dwells in Christ and in<br>
 bodily form <b><i>(\s&#333;matik&#333;s\, late and rare adverb, in Plutarch,<br>
 inscription, here only in N.T.)</i></b>, dwells now in Christ in his<br>
 glorified humanity <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 2:9-11)</i></b>, "the body of his glory" <b><i>(\t&#333;i<br>
 s&#333;mati t&#275;s dox&#275;s\)</i></b>. The fulness of the God-head was in Christ<br>
 before the Incarnation <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:1,18; Php 2:6)</i></b>, during the<br>
 Incarnation <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:14,18; 1Jo 1:1-3)</i></b>. It was the Son of God who<br>
 came in the likeness of men <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 2:7)</i></b>. Paul here disposes of<br>
 the Docetic theory that Jesus had no human body as well as the<br>
 Cerinthian separation between the man Jesus and the aeon Christ.<br>
 He asserts plainly the deity and the humanity of Jesus Christ in<br>
 corporeal form.<br>
 <br>
 2:10 <B>{Ye are made full}</B> <b><i>(\este pepl&#275;r&#333;menoi\)</i></b>. Periphrastic<br>
 perfect passive indicative of \pl&#275;ro&#333;\, but only one predicate,<br>
 not two. Christ is our fulness of which we all partake <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 1:16; Eph 1:23)</i></b> and our goal is to be made full of God in Christ<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph 3:19)</i></b>. "In Christ they find the satisfaction of every<br>
 spiritual want" <b><i>(Peake)</i></b>. <B>{The head}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; kaphal&#275;\)</i></b>. There is no<br>
 other place for Christ. He is first <b><i>(<!-#-->1:18)</i></b> in time and in rank.<br>
 All rule and authority comes after Christ whether angels, aeons,<br>
 kings, what not.<br>
 <br>
 2:11 <B>{Ye were also circumcised}</B> <b><i>(\kai perietm&#275;th&#275;te\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive indicative of \peritemn&#333;\, to circumcise. But used<br>
 here as a metaphor in a spiritual sense as in <!-#-->Ro 2:29 "the<br>
 circumcision of the heart." <B>{Not made with hands}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\acheiropoi&#275;t&#333;i\)</i></b>. This late and rare negative compound verbal<br>
 occurs only in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:58; 2Co 5:1; Col 2:11)</i></b> by merely<br>
 adding \a\ privative to the old verbal \cheiropoi&#275;tos\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 7:48;<br>
 Eph 2:11)</i></b>, possibly first in <!-#-->Mr 14:58 where both words occur<br>
 concerning the temple. In <!-#-->2Co 5:1 the reference is to the<br>
 resurrection body. The feminine form of this compound adjective<br>
 is the same as the masculine. <B>{In the putting off}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i<br>
 apekdusei\)</i></b>. As if an old garment <b><i>(the fleshly body)</i></b>. From<br>
 \apekduomai\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 2:15, possibly also coined by Paul)</i></b> and<br>
 occurring nowhere else so far as known. The word is made in a<br>
 perfectly normal way by the perfective use of the two Greek<br>
 prepositions <b><i>(\apo, ek\)</i></b>, "a resource available for and generally<br>
 used by any real thinker writing Greek" <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan,<br>
 _Vocabulary_)</i></b>. Paul had as much right to mint a Greek compound as<br>
 any one and surely no one ever had more ideas to express and more<br>
 power in doing it. <B>{Of Christ}</B> <b><i>(\tou Christou\)</i></b>. Specifying<br>
 genitive, the kind of circumcision that belongs to Christ, that<br>
 of the heart.<br>
 <br>
 2:12 <B>{Having been buried with him in baptism}</B> <b><i>(\suntaphentes<br>
 aut&#333;i en t&#333;i baptismati\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive participle of<br>
 \sunthapt&#333;\, old word, in N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ro 6:4, followed<br>
 by associative instrumental case <b><i>(\aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Thayer's Lexicon<br>
 says: "For all who in the rite of baptism are plunged under the<br>
 water, thereby declare that they put faith in the expiatory death<br>
 of Christ for the pardon of their past sins." Yes, and for all<br>
 future sins also. This word gives Paul's vivid picture of baptism<br>
 as a symbolic burial with Christ and resurrection also to newness<br>
 of life in him as Paul shows by the addition "wherein ye were<br>
 also raised with him" <b><i>(\en h&#333;i kai sun&#275;gerth&#275;te\)</i></b>. "In which<br>
 baptism" <b><i>(\baptismati\, he means)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative of \sunegeir&#333;\, late and rare verb <b><i>(Plutarch for<br>
 waking up together)</i></b>, in LXX, in N.T. only in <!-#-->Col 2:12; 3:1; Eph<br>
 2:6. In the symbol of baptism the resurrection to new life in<br>
 Christ is pictured with an allusion to Christ's own resurrection<br>
 and to our final resurrection. Paul does not mean to say that the<br>
 new life in Christ is caused or created by the act of baptism.<br>
 That is grossly to misunderstand him. The Gnostics and the<br>
 Judaizers were sacramentalists, but not so Paul the champion of<br>
 spiritual Christianity. He has just given the spiritual<br>
 interpretation to circumcision which itself followed Abraham's<br>
 faith <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 4:10-12)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Ga 3:27. Baptism gives a picture of<br>
 the change already wrought in the heart "through faith" <b><i>(\dia t&#275;s<br>
 piste&#333;s\)</i></b>. <B>{In the working of God}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;s energeias tou theou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Objective genitive after \piste&#333;s\. See <!-#-->1:29 for \energeia\.<br>
 God had power to raise Christ from the dead <b><i>(\tou egeirantos\,<br>
 first aorist active participle of \egeir&#333;\, the fact here stated)</i></b><br>
 and he has power <b><i>(energy)</i></b> to give us new life in Christ by faith.<br>
 <br>
 2:13 <B>{And you}</B> <b><i>(\kai humas\)</i></b>. Emphatic position, object of the<br>
 verb \sunez&#333;opoi&#275;sen\ <b><i>(did he quicken)</i></b> and repeated <b><i>(second<br>
 \hum&#257;s\)</i></b>. You Gentiles as he explains. <B>{Being dead through your<br>
 trespasses}</B> <b><i>(\nekrous ontas tois parapt&#333;masin\)</i></b>. Moral death, of<br>
 course, as in <!-#-->Ro 6:11; Eph 2:1,5. Correct text does not have<br>
 \en\, but even so \parapt&#333;masin\ <b><i>(from \parapipt&#333;\, to fall<br>
 beside or to lapse, <!-#-->Heb 6:6)</i></b>, a lapse or misstep as in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 6:14; Ro 5:15-18; Ga 6:1, can be still in the locative, though<br>
 the instrumental makes good sense also. <B>{And the uncircumcision<br>
 of your flesh}</B> <b><i>(\kai t&#275;i akrobousti&#257;i t&#275;s sarkos hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. "Dead<br>
 in your trespasses and your alienation from God, of which the<br>
 uncircumcision of your flesh was a symbol" <b><i>(Abbott)</i></b>. Clearly so,<br>
 "the uncircumcision" used merely in a metaphorical sense. <B>{Did he<br>
 quicken together with him}</B> <b><i>(\sunez&#333;opoi&#275;sen sun aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active indicative of the double compound verb<br>
 \sunz&#333;opoie&#333;\, to make alive <b><i>(\z&#333;os, poie&#333;\)</i></b> with <b><i>(\sun\,<br>
 repeated also with \aut&#333;i\, associative instrumental)</i></b>, found only<br>
 here and in <!-#-->Eph 2:5, apparently coined by Paul for this<br>
 passage. Probably \theos\ <b><i>(God)</i></b> is the subject because expressly<br>
 so stated in <!-#-->Eph 2:4f. and because demanded by \sun aut&#333;i\ here<br>
 referring to Christ. This can be true even if Christ be the<br>
 subject of \&#275;rken\ in verse <!-#-->14. <B>{Having forgiven us}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\charisamenos h&#275;min\)</i></b>. First aorist middle participle of<br>
 \charizomai\, common verb from \charis\ <b><i>(favour, grace)</i></b>. Dative<br>
 of the person common as in <!-#-->3:13. The act of forgiving is<br>
 simultaneous with the quickening, though logically antecedent.<br>
 <br>
 2:14 <B>{Having blotted out}</B> <b><i>(\exaleipsas\)</i></b>. And so "cancelled."<br>
 First aorist active participle of old verb \exaleiph&#333;\, to rub<br>
 out, wipe off, erase. In N.T. only in <!-#-->Ac 3:19 <b><i>(LXX)</i></b>; <!-#-->Re 3:5;<br>
 Col 2:14. Here the word explains \charisamenos\ and is<br>
 simultaneous with it. Plato used it of blotting out a writing.<br>
 Often MSS. were rubbed or scraped and written over again<br>
 <b><i>(palimpsests, like Codex C)</i></b>. <B>{The bond written in ordinances that<br>
 was against us}</B> <b><i>(\to kath' h&#275;m&#333;n cheirographon tois dogmasin\)</i></b>.<br>
 The late compound \cheirographon\ <b><i>(\cheir\, hand, \graph&#333;\)</i></b> is<br>
 very common in the papyri for a certificate of debt or bond, many<br>
 of the original \cheirographa\ <b><i>(handwriting, "chirography")</i></b>. See<br>
 Deissmann, _Bible Studies_, p. 247. The signature made a legal<br>
 debt or bond as Paul says in <!-#-->Phm 1:18f.: "I Paul have written<br>
 it with mine own hand, I will repay it." Many of the papyri<br>
 examples have been "crossed out" thus X as we do today and so<br>
 cancelled. One decree is described as "neither washed out nor<br>
 written over" <b><i>(Milligan, N. T. _Documents_,  p. 16)</i></b>. Undoubtedly<br>
 "the handwriting in decrees" <b><i>(\dogmasin\, the Mosaic law, <!-#-->Eph<br>
 2:15)</i></b> was against the Jews <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 24:3; De 27:14-26)</i></b> for they<br>
 accepted it, but the Gentiles also gave moral assent to God's law<br>
 written in their hearts <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 2:14f.)</i></b>. So Paul says "against us"<br>
 <b><i>(\kath' h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b> and adds "which was contrary to us" <b><i>(\ho &#275;n<br>
 hupenantion h&#275;min\)</i></b> because we <b><i>(neither Jew nor Gentile)</i></b> could<br>
 not keep it. \Hupenantios\ is an old double compound adjective<br>
 <b><i>(\hupo, en, antios\)</i></b> set over against, only here in N.T. except<br>
 <!-#-->Heb 10:27 when it is used as a substantive. It is striking that<br>
 Paul has connected the common word \cheirographon\ for bond or<br>
 debt with the Cross of Christ <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light, etc._, p. 332)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{And he hath taken it out of the way}</B> <b><i>(\kai &#275;rken ek tou mesou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Perfect active indicative of \air&#333;\, old and common verb, to lift<br>
 up, to bear, to take away. The word used by the Baptist of Jesus<br>
 as "the Lamb of God that bears away <b><i>(\air&#333;n\)</i></b> the sin of the<br>
 world" <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:29)</i></b>. The perfect tense emphasizes the permanence<br>
 of the removal of the bond which has been paid and cancelled and<br>
 cannot be presented again. Lightfoot argues for Christ as the<br>
 subject of \&#275;rken\, but that is not necessary, though Paul does<br>
 use sudden anacolutha. God has taken the bond against us "out of<br>
 the midst" <b><i>(\ek tou mesou\)</i></b>. Nailing it to the cross <b><i>(\pros&#275;l&#333;sas<br>
 auto t&#333;i staur&#333;i\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle of old and<br>
 common verb \pros&#275;lo&#333;\, to fasten with nails to a thing <b><i>(with<br>
 dative \staur&#333;i\)</i></b>. Here alone in N.T., but in III Macc. 4:9 with<br>
 the very word \staur&#333;i\. The victim was nailed to the cross as<br>
 was Christ. "When Christ was crucified, God nailed the Law to His<br>
 cross" <b><i>(Peake)</i></b>. Hence the "bond" is cancelled for us. Business<br>
 men today sometimes file cancelled accounts. No evidence exists<br>
 that Paul alluded to such a custom here.<br>
 <br>
 2:15 <B>{Having put off from himself}</B> <b><i>(\apekdusamenos\)</i></b>. Only here<br>
 and <!-#-->3:9 and one MS. of Josephus <b><i>(\apekdus\)</i></b>. Both \apodu&#333;\ and<br>
 \ekdu&#333;\ occur in ancient writers. Paul simply combines the two<br>
 for expression of complete removal. But two serious problems<br>
 arise here. Is God or Christ referred to by \apekdusamenos\? What<br>
 is meant by "the principalities and the powers" <b><i>(\tas archas kai<br>
 tas exousias\)</i></b>? Modern scholars differ radically and no full<br>
 discussion can be attempted here as one finds in Lightfoot,<br>
 Haupt, Abbott, Peake. On the whole I am inclined to look on God<br>
 as still the subject and the powers to be angels such as the<br>
 Gnostics worshipped and the verb to mean "despoil" <b><i>(American<br>
 Standard Version)</i></b> rather than "having put off from himself." In<br>
 the Cross of Christ God showed his power openly without aid or<br>
 help of angels. <B>{He made a show of them}</B> <b><i>(\edeigmatisen\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active indicative of \deigmatiz&#333;\, late and rare verb from<br>
 \deigma\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Jude 1:7)</i></b>, an example, and so to make an example of.<br>
 Frequent in the papyri though later than \paradeigmatiz&#333;\ and in<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mt 1:19 of Joseph's conduct toward Mary. No<br>
 idea of disgrace is necessarily involved in the word. The<br>
 publicity is made plain by "openly" <b><i>(\en parr&#275;si&#257;i\)</i></b>. <B>{Triumphing<br>
 over them on it}</B> <b><i>(\thriambeusas autous en aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. On the Cross<br>
 the triumph was won. This late, though common verb in _Koin&#275;_<br>
 writers <b><i>(\ekthriambeu&#333;\ in the papyri)</i></b> occurs only twice in the<br>
 N.T., once "to lead in triumph" <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 2:14)</i></b>, here to celebrate a<br>
 triumph <b><i>(the usual sense)</i></b>. It is derived from \thriambos\, a hymn<br>
 sung in festal procession and is kin to the Latin _triumphus_<br>
 <b><i>(our triumph)</i></b>, a triumphal procession of victorious Roman<br>
 generals. God won a complete triumph over all the angelic<br>
 agencies <b><i>(\autous\, masculine regarded as personal agencies)</i></b>.<br>
 Lightfoot adds, applying \thriambeusas\ to Christ: "The convict's<br>
 gibbet is the victor's car." It is possible, of course, to take<br>
 \aut&#333;i\ as referring to \cheirographon\ <b><i>(bond)</i></b> or even to Christ.<br>
 <br>
 2:16 <B>{Let no one judge you}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; tis humas krinet&#333;\)</i></b>. Prohibition<br>
 present active imperative third singular, forbidding the habit of<br>
 passing judgment in such matters. For \krin&#333;\ see on &#175;Mt 7:1.<br>
 Paul has here in mind the ascetic regulations and practices of<br>
 one wing of the Gnostics <b><i>(possibly Essenic or even Pharisaic<br>
 influence)</i></b>. He makes a plea for freedom in such matters on a par<br>
 with that in <!-#-->1Co 8-9; Ro 14; 15. The Essenes went far beyond<br>
 the Mosaic regulations. For the Jewish feasts see on &#175;Ga 4:10.<br>
 Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. III. 10, 1)</i></b> expressly explains the "seventh day"<br>
 as called "_sabbata_" <b><i>(plural form as here, an effort to<br>
 transliterate the Aramaic _sabbathah_)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:17 <B>{A shadow}</B> <b><i>(\skia\)</i></b>. Old word, opposed to substance <b><i>(\s&#333;ma\,<br>
 body)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Heb 10:1 \skia\ is distinguished from \eik&#333;n\<br>
 <b><i>(picture)</i></b>, but here from \s&#333;ma\ <b><i>(body, substance)</i></b>. The \s&#333;ma\<br>
 <b><i>(body)</i></b> casts the \skia\ <b><i>(shadow)</i></b> and so belongs to Christ<br>
 <b><i>(\Christou\, genitive case)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:18 <B>{Rob you of your prize}</B> <b><i>(\katabrabeuet&#333;\)</i></b>. Late and rare<br>
 compound <b><i>(\kata, brabeu&#333;\, <!-#-->Col 3:15)</i></b> to act as umpire against<br>
 one, perhaps because of bribery in Demosthenes and Eustathius<br>
 <b><i>(two other examples in Preisigke's _Worterbuch_)</i></b>, here only in<br>
 the N.T. So here it means to decide or give judgment against. The<br>
 judge at the games is called \brabeus\ and the prize \brabeion\<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 9:24; Php 3:14)</i></b>. It is thus parallel to, but stronger<br>
 than, \krinet&#333;\ in verse <!-#-->16. <B>{By a voluntary humility}</B> <b><i>(\thel&#333;n<br>
 en tapeinophrosun&#275;i\)</i></b>. Present active participle of \thel&#333;\, to<br>
 wish, to will, but a difficult idiom. Some take it as like an<br>
 adverb for "wilfully" somewhat like \thelontas\ in <!-#-->2Pe 3:5.<br>
 Others make it a Hebraism from the LXX usage, "finding pleasure<br>
 in humility." The Revised Version margin has "of his own mere<br>
 will, by humility." Hort suggested \en ethelotapeinophrosun&#275;i\<br>
 <b><i>(in gratuitous humility)</i></b>, a word that occurs in Basil and made<br>
 like \ethelothr&#275;skia\ in verse <!-#-->23. <B>{And worshipping of the<br>
 angels}</B> <b><i>(\kai thr&#275;skei&#257;i t&#333;n aggel&#333;n\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->3:12 humility<br>
 <b><i>(\tapeinophrosun&#275;n\)</i></b> is a virtue, but it is linked with worship<br>
 of the angels which is idolatry and so is probably false humility<br>
 as in verse <!-#-->23. They may have argued for angel worship on the<br>
 plea that God is high and far removed and so took angels as<br>
 mediators as some men do today with angels and saints in place of<br>
 Christ. <B>{Dwelling in the things which he hath seen}</B> <b><i>(\ha heoraken<br>
 embateu&#333;n\)</i></b>. Some MSS. have "not," but not genuine. This verb<br>
 \embateu&#333;\ <b><i>(from \embat&#275;s\, stepping in, going in)</i></b> has given much<br>
 trouble. Lightfoot has actually proposed \kenembateu&#333;n\ <b><i>(a verb<br>
 that does not exist, though \kenembate&#333;\ does occur)</i></b> with<br>
 \ai&#333;ra\, to tread on empty air, an ingenious suggestion, but now<br>
 unnecessary. It is an old word for going in to take possession<br>
 <b><i>(papyri examples also)</i></b>. W. M. Ramsay <b><i>(_Teaching of Paul_, pp.<br>
 287ff.)</i></b> shows from inscriptions in Klaros that the word is used<br>
 of an initiate in the mysteries who "set foot in" <b><i>(\enebateusen\)</i></b><br>
 and performed the rest of the rites. Paul is here quoting the<br>
 very work used of these initiates who "take their stand on" these<br>
 imagined revelations in the mysteries. <B>{Vainly puffed up}</B> <b><i>(\eik&#275;i<br>
 phusioumenos\)</i></b>. Present passive participle of \phusio&#333;\, late and<br>
 vivid verb from \phusa\, pair of bellows, in N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->1Co 4:6,18f.; 8:1. Powerful picture of the self-conceit of<br>
 these bombastic Gnostics.<br>
 <br>
 2:19 <B>{Not holding fast the Head}</B> <b><i>(\ou krat&#333;n t&#275;n kephal&#275;n\)</i></b>. Note<br>
 negative \ou\, not \m&#275;\, actual case of deserting Christ as the<br>
 Head. The Gnostics dethroned Christ from his primacy <b><i>(<!-#-->1:18)</i></b> and<br>
 placed him below a long line of aeons or angels. They did it with<br>
 words of praise for Christ as those do now who teach Christ as<br>
 only the noblest of men. The headship of Christ is the keynote of<br>
 this Epistle to the Colossians and the heart of Paul's<br>
 Christology. <B>{From whom}</B> <b><i>(\ex hou\)</i></b>. Masculine ablative rather<br>
 than \ex h&#275;s\ <b><i>(\kephal&#275;s\)</i></b> because Christ is the Head. He<br>
 develops the figure of the body of which Christ is Head<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1:18,24)</i></b>. <B>{Being supplied}</B> <b><i>(\epichor&#275;goumenon\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 passive participle <b><i>(continuous action)</i></b> of \epichor&#275;ge&#333;\, for<br>
 which interesting verb see already <!-#-->2Co 9:10; Ga 3:5 and further<br>
 <!-#-->2Pe 1:5. <B>{Knit together}</B> <b><i>(\sunbibazomenon\)</i></b>. Present passive<br>
 participle also <b><i>(continuous action)</i></b> of \sunbibaz&#333;\, for which see<br>
 <!-#-->Col 2:2. <B>{Through the joints}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#333;n haph&#333;n\)</i></b>. Late word<br>
 \haph&#275;\ <b><i>(from \hapt&#333;\, to fasten together)</i></b>, connections<br>
 <b><i>(_junctura_ and _nexus_ in the Vulgate)</i></b>. <B>{And bonds}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 sundesm&#333;n\)</i></b>. Old word from \sunde&#333;\, to bind together. Aristotle<br>
 and Galen use it of the human body. Both words picture well the<br>
 wonderful unity in the body by cells, muscles, arteries, veins,<br>
 nerves, skin, glands, etc. It is a marvellous machine working<br>
 together under the direction of the head. <B>{Increaseth with the<br>
 increase of God}</B> <b><i>(\auxei t&#275;n aux&#275;sin tou theou\)</i></b>. Cognate<br>
 accusative <b><i>(\aux&#275;sin\)</i></b> with the old verb \auxei\.<br>
 <br>
 2:20 <B>{If ye died}</B> <b><i>(\ei apethanete\)</i></b>. Condition of the first<br>
 class, assumed as true, \ei\ and second aorist active indicative<br>
 of \apothn&#275;sk&#333;\, to die. He is alluding to the picture of burial<br>
 in baptism <b><i>(<!-#-->2:12)</i></b>. <B>{From the rudiments of the world}</B> <b><i>(\apo t&#333;n<br>
 stoichei&#333;n tou kosmou\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->2:8. <B>{As though living in the<br>
 world}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s z&#333;ntes en kosm&#333;i\)</i></b>. Concessive use of the participle<br>
 with \h&#333;s\. The picture is that of baptism, having come out <b><i>(F.<br>
 B. Meyer)</i></b> on the other side of the grave, we are not to act as<br>
 though we had not done so. We are in the Land of Beulah. <B>{Why do<br>
 ye subject yourselves to ordinances?}</B> <b><i>(\ti dogmatizesthe?\)</i></b>. Late<br>
 and rare verb <b><i>(three examples in inscriptions and often in LXX)</i></b><br>
 made from \dogma\, decree or ordinance. Here it makes good sense<br>
 either as middle or passive. In either case they are to blame<br>
 since the bond of decrees <b><i>(<!-#-->2:14)</i></b> was removed on the Cross of<br>
 Christ. Paul still has in mind the rules of the ascetic wing of<br>
 the Gnostics <b><i>(<!-#-->2:16ff.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:21 <B>{Handle not, nor taste, nor touch}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; haps&#275;i m&#275;de geus&#275;i<br>
 m&#275;de thig&#275;is\)</i></b>. Specimens of Gnostic rules. The Essenes took the<br>
 Mosaic regulations and carried them much further and the<br>
 Pharisees demanded ceremonially clean hands for all food. Later<br>
 ascetics <b><i>(the Latin commentators Ambrose, Hilary, Pelagius)</i></b><br>
 regard these prohibitions as Paul's own instead of those of the<br>
 Gnostics condemned by him. Even today men are finding that the<br>
 noble prohibition law needs enlightened instruction to make it<br>
 effective. That is true of all law. The Pharisees, Essenes,<br>
 Gnostics made piety hinge on outward observances and rules<br>
 instead of inward conviction and principle. These three verbs are<br>
 all in the aorist subjunctive second person singular with \m&#275;\, a<br>
 prohibition against handling or touching these forbidden things.<br>
 Two of them do not differ greatly in meaning. \Haps&#275;i\ is aorist<br>
 middle subjunctive of \hapt&#333;\, to fasten to, middle, to cling to,<br>
 to handle. \Thig&#275;is\ is second aorist active subjunctive of<br>
 \thiggan&#333;\, old verb, to touch, to handle. In N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->Heb 11:28; 12:20. \Geus&#275;i\ is second aorist middle subjunctive<br>
 of \geu&#333;\, to give taste of, only middle in N.T. to taste as<br>
 here.<br>
 <br>
 2:22 <B>{Are to perish with the using}</B> <b><i>(\estin eis phthoran t&#275;i<br>
 apochr&#275;sei\)</i></b>. Literally, "are for perishing in the using."<br>
 \Phthora\ <b><i>(from \phtheir&#333;\)</i></b> is old word for decay, decomposition.<br>
 \Apochr&#275;sis\ <b><i>(from \apochraomai\, to use to the full, to use up)</i></b>,<br>
 late and rare word <b><i>(in Plutarch)</i></b>, here only in N.T. Either<br>
 locative case here or instrumental. These material things all<br>
 perish in the use of them.<br>
 <br>
 2:23 <B>{Which things}</B> <b><i>(\hatina\)</i></b>. "Which very things," these<br>
 ascetic regulations. <B>{Have indeed a show of wisdom}</B> <b><i>(\estin logon<br>
 men echonta sophias\)</i></b>. Periphrastic present indicative with<br>
 \estin\ in the singular, but present indicative \echonta\ in the<br>
 plural <b><i>(\hatina\)</i></b>. \Logon sophias\ is probably "the repute of<br>
 wisdom" <b><i>(Abbott)</i></b> like Plato and Herodotus. \Men\ <b><i>(in deed)</i></b> has no<br>
 corresponding \de\. <B>{In will-worship}</B> <b><i>(\en ethelothr&#275;ski&#257;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 This word occurs nowhere else and was probably coined by Paul<br>
 after the pattern of \ethelodouleia\, to describe the voluntary<br>
 worship of angels <b><i>(see <!-#-->2:18)</i></b>. <B>{And humility}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 tapeinophrosun&#275;i\)</i></b>. Clearly here the bad sense, "in mock<br>
 humility." <B>{And severity to the body}</B> <b><i>(\kai apheidi&#257;i s&#333;matos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Old word <b><i>(Plato)</i></b> from \apheid&#275;s\, unsparing <b><i>(\a\ privative,<br>
 \pheidomai\, to spare)</i></b>. Here alone in N.T. Ascetics often<br>
 practice flagellations and other hardnesses to the body. <B>{Not of<br>
 any value}</B> <b><i>(\ouk en tim&#275;i tini\)</i></b>. \Tim&#275;\ usually means honour or<br>
 price. <B>{Against the indulgence of the flesh}</B> <b><i>(\pros pl&#275;smon&#275;n t&#275;s<br>
 sarkos\)</i></b>. These words are sharply debated along with \tim&#275;\ just<br>
 before. It is not unusual for \pros\ to be found in the sense of<br>
 "against" rather than "with" or "for." See \pros\ in sense of<br>
 <B>{against}</B> in <!-#-->3:13; Eph 6:11f.; 2Co 5:12; 1Co 6:1. \Pl&#275;smon&#275;\ is<br>
 an old word from \pimpl&#275;mi\, to fill and means satiety. It occurs<br>
 here only in the N.T. Peake is inclined to agree with Hort and<br>
 Haupt that there is a primitive corruption here. But the<br>
 translation in the Revised Version is possible and it is true<br>
 that mere rules do not carry us very far in human conduct as<br>
 every father or mother knows, though we must have some<br>
 regulations in family and state and church. But they are not<br>
 enough of themselves.<br>
