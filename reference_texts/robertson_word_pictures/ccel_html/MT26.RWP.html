<p>26:2 <B>{Cometh}</B> <b><i>(\ginetai\)</i></b>. Futuristic use of the present middle<br>
 indicative. This was probably our Tuesday evening <b><i>(beginning of<br>
 Jewish Wednesday)</i></b>. The passover began on our Thursday evening<br>
 <b><i>(beginning of Jewish Friday)</i></b>. <B>{After two days}</B> <b><i>(\meta duo<br>
 h&#275;meras\)</i></b> is just the familiar popular mode of speech. The<br>
 passover came technically on the second day from this time. <B>{Is<br>
 delivered up}</B> <b><i>(\paradidotai\)</i></b>. Another instance of the futuristic<br>
 present passive indicative. The same form occurs in verse <!-#-->24.<br>
 Thus Jesus sets a definite date for the coming crucifixion which<br>
 he has been predicting for six months.<br>
 <br>
 26:3 <B>{Then were gathered together the chief priests and elders of<br>
 the people}</B> <b><i>(\Tote sun&#275;chth&#275;san hoi archiereis kai hoi<br>
 presbuteroi tou laou\)</i></b>. A meeting of the Sanhedrin as these two<br>
 groups indicate <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->21:23)</i></b>. <B>{Unto the court}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n<br>
 aul&#275;n\)</i></b>. The _atrium_ or court around which the palace buildings<br>
 were built. Here in this open court this informal meeting was<br>
 held. Caiaphas was high priest A.D. 18 to 36. His father-in-law<br>
 Annas had been high priest A.D. 6 to 15 and was still called high<br>
 priest by many.<br>
 <br>
 26:4 <B>{They took counsel together}</B> <b><i>(\sunebouleusanto\)</i></b>. Aorist<br>
 middle indicative, indicating their puzzled state of mind. They<br>
 have had no trouble in finding Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 11:57)</i></b>. Their problem<br>
 now is how to <B>{take Jesus by subtilty and kill him}</B> <b><i>(\hina ton<br>
 I&#275;soun dol&#333;i krat&#275;sosin kai apoktein&#333;sin\)</i></b>. The Triumphal Entry<br>
 and the Tuesday debate in the temple revealed the powerful<br>
 following that Jesus had among the crowds from Galilee.<br>
 <br>
 26:5 <B>{A tumult}</B> <b><i>(\thorubos\)</i></b>. They feared the uprising in behalf<br>
 of Jesus and were arguing that the matter must be postponed till<br>
 after the feast was over when the crowds had scattered. Then they<br>
 could catch him "by craft" <b><i>(\dol&#333;i\)</i></b> as they would trap a wild<br>
 beast.<br>
 <br>
 26:6 <B>{In the house of Simon the leper}</B> <b><i>(\en oiki&#257;i Sim&#333;nos tou<br>
 leprou\)</i></b>. Evidently a man who had been healed of his leprosy by<br>
 Jesus who gave the feast in honour of Jesus. All sorts of<br>
 fantastic theories have arisen about it. Some even identify this<br>
 Simon with the one in <!-#-->Lu 7:36ff., but Simon was a very common<br>
 name and the details are very different. Some hold that it was<br>
 Martha's house because she served <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 12:2)</i></b> and that Simon was<br>
 either the father or husband of Martha, but Martha loved to serve<br>
 and that proves nothing. Some identify Mary of Bethany with the<br>
 sinful woman in <!-#-->Lu 7 and even with Mary Magdalene, both<br>
 gratuitous and groundless propositions. For the proof that Mary<br>
 of Bethany, Mary Magdalene, and the sinful woman of <!-#-->Lu 7 are<br>
 all distinct see my _Some Minor Characters in the New Testament_.<br>
 John <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 12:1)</i></b> apparently locates the feast six days before<br>
 the passover, while Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:3)</i></b> and Matthew <b><i>(<!-#-->26:6)</i></b> seem to<br>
 place it on the Tuesday evening <b><i>(Jewish Wednesday)</i></b> just two days<br>
 before the passover meal. It is possible that John anticipates<br>
 the date and notes the feast at Bethany at this time because he<br>
 does not refer to Bethany again. If not, the order of Mark must<br>
 be followed. According to the order of Mark and Matthew, this<br>
 feast took place at the very time that the Sanhedrin was plotting<br>
 about the death of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:1f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 26:7 <B>{An alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\alabastron murou barutimou\)</i></b>. The flask was of alabaster, a<br>
 carbonate of lime or sulphate of lime, white or yellow stone,<br>
 named alabaster from the town in Egypt where it was chiefly<br>
 found. It was used for a phial employed for precious ointments in<br>
 ancient writers, inscriptions and papyri just as we speak of a<br>
 glass for the vessel made of glass. It had a cylindrical form at<br>
 the top, as a rule, like a closed rosebud <b><i>(Pliny)</i></b>. Matthew does<br>
 not say what the ointment <b><i>(\murou\)</i></b> was, only saying that it was<br>
 "exceeding precious" <b><i>(\barutimou\)</i></b>, of weighty value, selling at<br>
 a great price. Here only in the N.T. "An alabaster of nard<br>
 <b><i>(\murou\)</i></b> was a present for a king" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. It was one of five<br>
 presents sent by Cambyses to the King of Ethiopia <b><i>(Herodotus,<br>
 iii. 20)</i></b>. <B>{She poured it upon his head}</B> <b><i>(\katecheen epi t&#275;s<br>
 kephal&#275;s autou\)</i></b>. So Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:3)</i></b>, while John <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 12:3)</i></b><br>
 says that she "anointed the feet of Jesus." Why not both? The<br>
 verb \katecheen\ is literally to pour down. It is the first<br>
 aorist active indicative, unusual form.<br>
 <br>
 26:8 <B>{This waste}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; ap&#333;leia haut&#275;\)</i></b>. Dead loss <b><i>(\ap&#333;leia\)</i></b><br>
 they considered it, nothing but sentimental aroma. It was a cruel<br>
 shock to Mary of Bethany to hear this comment. Matthew does not<br>
 tell as John does <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 12:4)</i></b> that it was Judas who made the<br>
 point which the rest endorsed. Mark explains that they mentioned<br>
 "three hundred pence," while Matthew <b><i>(<!-#-->26:9)</i></b> only says "for<br>
 much" <b><i>(\pollou\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 26:10 <B>{Why trouble ye the woman?}</B> <b><i>(\ti kopous parechete t&#275;i<br>
 gunaiki?\)</i></b> A phrase not common in Greek writers, though two<br>
 examples occur in the papyri for giving trouble. \Kopos\ is from<br>
 \kopt&#333;\, to beat, smite, cut. It is a beating, trouble, and often<br>
 work, toil. Jesus champions Mary's act with this striking phrase.<br>
 It is so hard for some people to allow others liberty for their<br>
 own personalities to express themselves. It is easy to raise<br>
 small objections to what we do not like and do not understand. <B>{A<br>
 good work upon me}</B> <b><i>(\ergon kalon eis eme\)</i></b>. A beautiful deed upon<br>
 Jesus himself.<br>
 <br>
 26:12 <B>{To prepare me for burial}</B> <b><i>(\pros to entaphiasai me\)</i></b>. Mary<br>
 alone had understood what Jesus had repeatedly said about his<br>
 approaching death. The disciples were so wrapped up in their own<br>
 notions of a political kingdom that they failed utterly to<br>
 sympathize with Jesus as he faced the cross. But Mary with the<br>
 woman's fine intuitions did begin to understand and this was her<br>
 way of expressing her high emotions and loyalty. The word here is<br>
 the same used in <!-#-->Joh 19:40 about what Joseph of Arimathea and<br>
 Nicodemus did for the body of Jesus before burial with the<br>
 addition of \pros to\ showing the purpose of Mary <b><i>(the infinitive<br>
 of purpose)</i></b>. Mary was vindicated by Jesus and her noble deed has<br>
 become a "memorial of her" <b><i>(\eis mn&#275;mosumon aut&#275;s\)</i></b> as well as of<br>
 Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 26:15 <B>{What are ye willing to give me?}</B> <b><i>(\ti thelete moi<br>
 dounai?\)</i></b> This "brings out the _chaffering_ aspect of the<br>
 transaction" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. "Mary and Judas extreme opposites: she<br>
 freely spending in love, he willing to sell his Master for money"<br>
 <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. And her act of love provoked Judas to his despicable<br>
 deed, this rebuke of Jesus added to all the rest. <B>{And I will<br>
 deliver him unto you}</B> <b><i>(\kag&#333; h&#8211;min parad&#333;s&#333; auton\)</i></b>. The use of<br>
 \kai\ with a co-ordinate clause is a colloquialism <b><i>(common in the<br>
 _Koin&#275;_ as in the Hebrew use of _wav_. "A colloquialism or a<br>
 Hebraism, the traitor mean in style as in spirit" (Bruce)</i></b>. The<br>
 use of \eg&#333;\ seems to mean "I though one of his disciples will<br>
 hand him over to you if you give me enough." <B>{They weighed unto<br>
 him}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de est&#275;san auto\)</i></b>. They placed the money in the<br>
 balances or scales. "Coined money was in use, but the shekels may<br>
 have been weighed out in antique fashion by men careful to do an<br>
 iniquitous thing in the most orthodox way" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. It is not<br>
 known whether the Sanhedrin had offered a reward for the arrest<br>
 of Jesus or not. <B>{Thirty pieces of silver}</B> <b><i>(\triakonta arguria\)</i></b>.<br>
 A reference to <!-#-->Zec 11:12. If a man's ox gored a servant, he had<br>
 to pay this amount <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 21:32)</i></b>. Some manuscripts have \stat&#275;ras\<br>
 <b><i>(staters)</i></b>. These thirty silver shekels were equal to 120<br>
 \denarii\, less than five English pounds, less than twenty-five<br>
 dollars, the current price of a slave. There was no doubt<br>
 contempt for Jesus in the minds of both the Sanhedrin and Judas<br>
 in this bargain.<br>
 <br>
 26:16 <B>{Sought opportunity}</B> <b><i>(\ez&#275;tei eukarian\)</i></b>. A good chance.<br>
 Note imperfect tense. Judas went at his business and stuck to it.<br>
 <br>
 26:17 <B>{To eat the passover}</B> <b><i>(\phagein to pascha\)</i></b>. There were two<br>
 feasts rolled into one, the passover feast and the feast of<br>
 unleavened bread. Either name was employed. Here the passover<br>
 meal is meant, though in <!-#-->Joh 18:28 it is probable that the<br>
 passover feast is referred to as the passover meal <b><i>(the last<br>
 supper)</i></b> had already been observed. There is a famous controversy<br>
 on the apparent disagreement between the Synoptic Gospels and the<br>
 Fourth Gospel on the date of this last passover meal. My view is<br>
 that the five passages in John <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 13:1f.,27; 18:28; 19:14,31)</i></b><br>
 rightly interpreted agree with the Synoptic Gospels <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 26:17,20; Mr 14:12,17; Lu 22:7,14)</i></b> that Jesus ate the passover<br>
 meal at the regular time about 6 P.M. beginning of 15 Nisan. The<br>
 passover lamb was slain on the afternoon of 14 Nisan and the meal<br>
 eaten at sunset the beginning of 15 Nisan. According to this view<br>
 Jesus ate the passover meal at the regular time and died on the<br>
 cross the afternoon of 15 Nisan. See my _Harmony of the Gospels<br>
 for Students of the Life of Christ_, pp.279-284. The question of<br>
 the disciples here assumes that they are to observe the regular<br>
 passover meal. Note the deliberative subjunctive <b><i>(\hetoimas&#333;men\)</i></b><br>
 after \theleis\ with \hina\. For the asyndeton see Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 935.<br>
 <br>
 26:18 <B>{To such a man}</B> <b><i>(\pros ton deina\)</i></b>. The only instance in<br>
 the N.T. of this old Attic idiom. The papyri show it for "Mr. X"<br>
 and the modern Greek keeps it. Jesus may have indicated the man's<br>
 name. Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:13)</i></b> and Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:10)</i></b> describe him as a<br>
 man bearing a pitcher of water. It may have been the home of Mary<br>
 the mother of John Mark. <B>{I keep the passover at thy house}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pros se poi&#333; to pascha\)</i></b>. Futuristic present indicative. The<br>
 use of \pros se\ for "at thy house" is neat Greek of the classic<br>
 period. Evidently there was no surprise in this home at the<br>
 command of Jesus. It was a gracious privilege to serve him thus.<br>
 <br>
 26:20 <B>{He was sitting at meat}</B> <b><i>(\anekeito\)</i></b>. He was reclining,<br>
 lying back on the left side on the couch with the right hand<br>
 free. Jesus and the Twelve all reclined. The paschal lamb had to<br>
 be eaten up entirely <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 12:4,43)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 26:21 <B>{One of you}</B> <b><i>(\heis ex hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. This was a bolt from the<br>
 blue for all except Judas and he was startled to know that Jesus<br>
 understood his treacherous bargain.<br>
 <br>
 26:22 <B>{Is it I, Lord?}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;ti eg&#333; eimi, Kurie;\)</i></b>. The negative<br>
 expects the answer No and was natural for all save Judas. But he<br>
 had to bluff it out by the same form of question <b><i>(verse <!-#-->25)</i></b>.<br>
 The answer of Jesus, <B>{Thou hast said}</B> <b><i>(\su eipas\)</i></b>, means Yes.<br>
 <br>
 26:23 <B>{He that dipped}</B> <b><i>(\ho embapsas\)</i></b>. They all dipped their<br>
 hands, having no knives, forks, or spoons. The aorist participle<br>
 with the article simply means that the betrayer is the one who<br>
 dips his hand in the dish <b><i>(\en t&#333;i trubli&#333;i\)</i></b> or platter with the<br>
 broth of nuts and raisins and figs into which the bread was<br>
 dipped before eating. It is plain that Judas was not recognized<br>
 by the rest as indicated by what Jesus has said. This language<br>
 means that one of those who had eaten bread with him had violated<br>
 the rights of hospitality by betraying him. The Arabs today are<br>
 punctilious on this point. Eating one's bread ties your hands and<br>
 compels friendship. But Judas knew full well as is shown in verse<br>
 <!-#-->25 though the rest apparently did not grasp it.<br>
 <br>
 26:24 <B>{Good were it for that man}</B> <b><i>(\kalon &#275;n aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Conclusion<br>
 of second-class condition even though \an\ is not expressed. It<br>
 is not needed with verbs of obligation and necessity. There are<br>
 some today who seek to palliate the crime of Judas. But Jesus<br>
 here pronounces his terrible doom. And Judas heard it and went on<br>
 with his hellish bargain with the Sanhedrin. Apparently Judas<br>
 went out at this stage <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 13:31)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 26:26 <B>{And blessed and brake it}</B> <b><i>(\eulog&#275;sas eklasen\)</i></b>. Special<br>
 "Grace" in the middle of the passover meal, "as they were<br>
 eating," for the institution of the Supper. Jesus broke one of<br>
 the passover wafers or cakes that each might have a piece, not as<br>
 a symbol of the breaking of his body as the Textus Receptus has<br>
 it in <!-#-->1Co 11:24. The correct text there has only to \huper<br>
 hum&#333;n\ without \kl&#333;menon\. As a matter of fact the body of Jesus<br>
 was not "broken" <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:33)</i></b> as John expressly states. <B>{This is<br>
 my body}</B> <b><i>(\touto estin to s&#333;ma mou\)</i></b>. The bread as a symbol<br>
 _represents_ the body of Jesus offered for us, "a beautifully<br>
 simple, pathetic, and poetic symbol of his death" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. But<br>
 some have made it "run into fetish worship" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Jesus, of<br>
 course, does not mean that the bread actually becomes his body<br>
 and is to be worshipped. The purpose of the memorial is to remind<br>
 us of his death for our sins.<br>
 <br>
 26:28 <B>{The Covenant}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;s diath&#275;k&#275;s\)</i></b>. The adjective \kain&#275;s\ in<br>
 Textus Receptus is not genuine. The covenant is an agreement or<br>
 contract between two <b><i>(\dia, duo, th&#275;ke\, from \tith&#275;mi\)</i></b>. It is<br>
 used also for will <b><i>(Latin, _testamentum_)</i></b> which becomes operative<br>
 at death <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 9:15-17)</i></b>. Hence our _New Testament_. Either<br>
 covenant or will makes sense here. Covenant is the idea in <!-#-->Heb<br>
 7:22; 8:8 and often. In the Hebrew to make a covenant was to cut<br>
 up the sacrifice and so ratify the agreement <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 15:9-18)</i></b>.<br>
 Lightfoot argues that the word \diath&#275;ke\ means covenant in the<br>
 N.T. except in <!-#-->Heb 9:15-17. Jesus here uses the solemn words of<br>
 <!-#-->Ex 24:8 "the blood of the covenant" at Sinai. "My blood of the<br>
 covenant" is in contrast with that. This is the New Covenant of<br>
 <!-#-->Jer 31; Heb 8. <B>{Which is shed for many}</B> <b><i>(\to peri poll&#333;n<br>
 ekchunnomenon\)</i></b>. A prophetic present passive participle. The act<br>
 is symbolized by the ordinance. Cf. the purpose of Christ<br>
 expressed in <!-#-->20:28. There \anti\ and here \peri\. <B>{Unto<br>
 remission of sins}</B> <b><i>(\eis aphesin hamarti&#333;n\)</i></b>. This clause is in<br>
 Matthew alone but it is not to be restricted for that reason. It<br>
 is the truth. This passage answers all the modern sentimentalism<br>
 that finds in the teaching of Jesus only pious ethical remarks or<br>
 eschatological dreamings. He had the definite conception of his<br>
 death on the cross as the basis of forgiveness of sin. The<br>
 purpose of the shedding of his blood of the New Covenant was<br>
 precisely to remove <b><i>(forgive)</i></b> sins.<br>
 <br>
 26:29 <B>{When I drink it new with you}</B> <b><i>(\hotan auto pin&#333; meth'<br>
 hum&#333;n kaimon\)</i></b>. This language rather implies that Jesus himself<br>
 partook of the bread and the wine, though it is not distinctly<br>
 stated. In the Messianic banquet it is not necessary to suppose<br>
 that Jesus means the language literally, "the fruit of the vine."<br>
 Deissmann <b><i>(_Bible Studies_, pp. 109f.)</i></b> gives an instance of<br>
 \gen&#275;ma\ used of the vine in a papyrus 230 B.C. The language here<br>
 employed does not make it obligatory to employ wine rather than<br>
 pure grape juice if one wishes the other.<br>
 <br>
 26:30 <B>{Sang a hymn}</B> <b><i>(\humn&#275;santes\)</i></b>. The _Hallel_, part of <!-#-->Ps<br>
 115-118. But apparently they did not go out at once to the<br>
 Garden of Gethsemane. Jesus tarried with them in the Upper Room<br>
 for the wonderful discourse and prayer in <!-#-->Joh 14-17. They may<br>
 have gone out to the street after <!-#-->Joh 14:31. It was no longer<br>
 considered obligatory to remain in the house after the passover<br>
 meal till morning as at the start <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 12:22)</i></b>. Jesus went out to<br>
 Gethsemane, the garden of the agony, outside of Jerusalem, toward<br>
 the Mount of Olives.<br>
 <br>
 26:33 <B>{I will never be offended}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; oudepote<br>
 skandalisth&#275;somai\)</i></b>. "Made to stumble," not "offended." Volitive<br>
 future passive indicative. Peter ignored the prophecy of the<br>
 resurrection of Jesus and the promised meeting in Galilee <b><i>(<!-#-->32)</i></b>.<br>
 The quotation from <!-#-->Zec 13:7 made no impression on him. He was<br>
 intent on showing that he was superior to "all" the rest. Judas<br>
 had turned traitor and all were weak, Peter in particular, little<br>
 as he knew it. So Jesus has to make it plainer by pointing out<br>
 "this night" as the time <b><i>(<!-#-->34)</i></b>. <B>{Before the cock crows}</B> <b><i>(\prin<br>
 alektora ph&#333;n&#275;sai\)</i></b>. No article in the Greek, "before a cock<br>
 crow." Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:30)</i></b> says that Peter will deny Jesus thrice<br>
 before the cock crows twice. When one cock crows in the morning,<br>
 others generally follow. The three denials lasted over an hour.<br>
 Some scholars hold that chickens were not allowed in Jerusalem by<br>
 the Jews, but the Romans would have them.<br>
 <br>
 26:35 <B>{Even if I must die with thee}</B> <b><i>(\k&#8230;n de&#275;i me sun soi<br>
 apothanein\)</i></b>. Third-class condition. A noble speech and meant<br>
 well. His boast of loyalty is made still stronger by \ou m&#275; se<br>
 aparn&#275;somai\. The other disciples were undoubtedly embarrassed by<br>
 Peter's boast and lightheartedly joined in the same profession of<br>
 fidelity.<br>
 <br>
 26:36 <B>{Gethsemane}</B> <b><i>(\Geths&#275;manei\)</i></b>. The word means oil-press in<br>
 the Hebrew, or olive vat. The place <b><i>(\ch&#333;rion\)</i></b> was an enclosed<br>
 plot or estate, "garden," or orchard <b><i>(\k&#275;pos\)</i></b>. It is called<br>
 _villa_ in the Vulgate according to <!-#-->Joh 18:1. It was beyond the<br>
 torrent Kedron at the foot of the Mount of Olives about<br>
 three-fourths of a mile from the eastern walls of Jerusalem.<br>
 There are now eight old olive trees still standing in this<br>
 enclosure. One cannot say that they are the very trees near which<br>
 Jesus had his Agony, but they are very old. "They will remain so<br>
 long as their already protracted life is spared, the most<br>
 venerable of their race on the surface of the earth. Their<br>
 guarded trunks and scanty foliage will always be regarded as the<br>
 most affecting of the sacred memorials in or about Jerusalem"<br>
 <b><i>(Stanley, _Sinai and Palestine_)</i></b>. <B>{Here}</B> <b><i>(\autou\)</i></b>, <B>{Yonder}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ekei\)</i></b>. Jesus clearly pointed to the place where he would pray.<br>
 Literally "there."<br>
 <br>
 26:37 <B>{He took with him}</B> <b><i>(\paralab&#333;n\)</i></b>. Taking along, by his side<br>
 <b><i>(\para-\)</i></b>, as a mark of special favour and privilege, instead of<br>
 leaving this inner circle of three <b><i>(Peter, James, and John)</i></b> with<br>
 the other eight. The eight would serve as a sort of outer guard<br>
 to watch by the gate of the garden for the coming of Judas while<br>
 the three would be able to share the agony of soul already upon<br>
 Jesus so as at least to give him some human sympathy which he<br>
 craved as he sought help from the Father in prayer. These three<br>
 had been with Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration and now they<br>
 are with him in this supreme crisis. The grief of Christ was now<br>
 severe. The word for <B>{sore troubled}</B> <b><i>(\ad&#275;monein\)</i></b> is of doubtful<br>
 etymology. There is an adjective \ad&#275;mos\ equal to \apod&#275;mos\<br>
 meaning "not at home," "away from home," like the German<br>
 _unheimisch, unheimlich_. But whatever the etymology, the notion<br>
 of intense discomfort is plain. The word \ad&#275;monein\ occurs in<br>
 P.Oxy. II, 298,456 of the first century A.D. where it means<br>
 "excessively concerned." See <!-#-->Php 2:26 where Paul uses it of<br>
 Epaphroditus. Moffatt renders it here "agitated." The word occurs<br>
 sometimes with \apore&#333;\ to be at a loss as to which way to go.<br>
 The _Braid Scots_ has it "sair putten-aboot." Here Matthew has<br>
 also "to be sorrowful" <b><i>(\lupeisthai\)</i></b>, but Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:33)</i></b> has<br>
 the startling phrase <B>{greatly amazed and sore troubled}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ekthambeisthai kai ad&#275;monein\)</i></b>, a "feeling of terrified<br>
 surprise."<br>
 <br>
 26:38 <B>{Watch with me}</B> <b><i>(\gr&#275;goreite met' emou\)</i></b>. This late present<br>
 from the perfect \egr&#275;gora\ means to keep awake and not go to<br>
 sleep. The hour was late and the strain had been severe, but<br>
 Jesus pleaded for a bit of human sympathy as he wrestled with his<br>
 Father. It did not seem too much to ask. He had put his sorrow in<br>
 strong language, "even unto death" <b><i>(\he&#333;s thanatou\)</i></b> that ought<br>
 to have alarmed them.<br>
 <br>
 26:39 <B>{He went forward a little}</B> <b><i>(\proelth&#333;n mikron\)</i></b>. As if he<br>
 could not fight the battle in their immediate presence. He was on<br>
 his face, not on his knees <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. <B>{This cup}</B> <b><i>(\to pot&#275;rion<br>
 touto\)</i></b>. The figure can mean only the approaching death. Jesus<br>
 had used it of his coming death when James and John came to him<br>
 with their ambitious request, "the cup which I am about to drink"<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 20:22)</i></b>. But now the Master is about to taste the bitter<br>
 dregs in the cup of death for the sin of the world. He was not<br>
 afraid that he would die before the Cross, though he<br>
 instinctively shrank from the cup, but instantly surrendered his<br>
 will to the Father's will and drank it to the full. Evidently<br>
 Satan tempted Christ now to draw back from the Cross. Here Jesus<br>
 won the power to go on to Calvary.<br>
 <br>
 26:40 <B>{What}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s\)</i></b>. The Greek adverb is not interrogation or<br>
 exclamatory \ti\, but only "so" or "thus." There is a tone of sad<br>
 disappointment at the discovery that they were asleep after the<br>
 earnest plea that they keep awake <b><i>(verse <!-#-->38)</i></b>. "Did you not thus<br>
 have strength enough to keep awake one hour?" Every word struck<br>
 home.<br>
 <br>
 26:41 <B>{Watch and pray}</B> <b><i>(\gr&#275;goreite kai proseuchesthe\)</i></b>. Jesus<br>
 repeats the command of verse <!-#-->38 with the addition of prayer and<br>
 with the warning against the peril of temptation. He himself was<br>
 feeling the worst of all temptations of his earthly life just<br>
 then. He did not wish then to enter such temptation <b><i>(\peirasmon\,<br>
 here in this sense, not mere trial)</i></b>. Thus we are to understand<br>
 the prayer in <!-#-->Mt 6:13 about leading <b><i>(being led)</i></b> into<br>
 temptation. Their failure was due to weakness of the flesh as is<br>
 often the case. <B>{Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\pneuma\)</i></b> here is the moral life<br>
 <b><i>(\intellect, will, emotions\)</i></b> as opposed to the flesh <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Isa<br>
 31:3; Ro 7:25)</i></b>. <B>{Except I drink it}</B> <b><i>(\ean m&#275; auto pi&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 Condition of the third class undetermined, but with likelihood of<br>
 determination, whereas <B>{if this cannot pass away}</B> <b><i>(\ei ou dunatai<br>
 touto parelthein\)</i></b> is first-class condition, determined as<br>
 fulfilled, assumed to be true. This delicate distinction<br>
 accurately presents the real attitude of Jesus towards this<br>
 subtle temptation.<br>
 <br>
 26:43 <B>{For their eyes were heavy}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san gar aut&#333;n hoi ophthalmoi<br>
 bebar&#275;menoi\)</i></b>. Past perfect passive indicative periphrastic.<br>
 Their eyes had been weighted down with sleep and still were as<br>
 they had been on the Mount of Transfiguration <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:32)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 26:45 <B>{Sleep on now and take your rest}</B> <b><i>(\katheudete loipon kai<br>
 anapauesthe\)</i></b>. This makes it "mournful irony" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b> or<br>
 reproachful concession: "Ye may sleep and rest indefinitely so<br>
 far as I am concerned; I need no longer your watchful interest"<br>
 <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. It may be a sad query as Goodspeed: "Are you still<br>
 sleeping and taking your rest?" So Moffatt. This use of \loipon\<br>
 for now or henceforth is common in the papyri. <B>{The hour is at<br>
 hand}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;ggiken h&#275; h&#333;ra\)</i></b>. Time for action has now come. They<br>
 have missed their chance for sympathy with Jesus. He has now won<br>
 the victory without their aid. "The Master's time of weakness is<br>
 past; He is prepared to face the worst" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. <B>{Is betrayed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\paradidotai\)</i></b>. Futuristic present or inchoative present, the<br>
 first act in the betrayal is at hand. Jesus had foreseen his<br>
 "hour" for long and now he faces it bravely.<br>
 <br>
 26:46 <B>{He is at hand}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;ggiken\)</i></b>. The same verb and tense used<br>
 of the hour above, present perfect active of \eggiz&#333;\, to draw<br>
 near, the very form used by John the Baptist of the coming of the<br>
 kingdom of heaven <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 3:2)</i></b>. Whether Jesus heard the approach of<br>
 the betrayer with the crowd around him or saw the lights or just<br>
 felt the proximity of the traitor before he was there <b><i>(J. Weiss)</i></b>,<br>
 we do not know and it matters little. The scene is pictured as it<br>
 happened with lifelike power.<br>
 <br>
 26:47 <B>{While he yet spake}</B> <b><i>(\eti autou lalountos\)</i></b>. It was an<br>
 electric moment as Jesus faced Judas with his horde of helpers as<br>
 if he turned to meet an army. <B>{Let us go}</B> <b><i>(\ag&#333;men\)</i></b>, Jesus had<br>
 said. And here he is. The eight at the gate seemed to have given<br>
 no notice. Judas is described here as "one of the twelve" <b><i>(\heis<br>
 t&#333;n d&#333;deka\)</i></b> in all three Synoptic Gospels <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:43; Mt 26:47;<br>
 Lu 22:47)</i></b>. The very horror of the thing is thus emphasized, that<br>
 one of the chosen twelve apostles should do this dastardly deed.<br>
 <B>{A great multitude}</B> <b><i>(\ochlos polus\)</i></b>. The chief priests and<br>
 Pharisees had furnished Judas a band of soldiers from the<br>
 garrison in Antonia <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:3)</i></b> and the temple police <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 22:52)</i></b> with swords <b><i>(knives)</i></b> and staves <b><i>(clubs)</i></b> with a hired<br>
 rabble who had lanterns also <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:3)</i></b> in spite of the full<br>
 moon. Judas was taking no chances of failure for he well knew the<br>
 strange power of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 26:48 <B>{Gave them a sign}</B> <b><i>(\ed&#333;ken autois s&#275;meion\)</i></b>. Probably just<br>
 before he reached the place, though Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:44)</i></b> has "had<br>
 given" <b><i>(\ded&#333;kei\)</i></b> which certainly means before arrival at<br>
 Gethsemane. At any rate Judas had given the leaders to understand<br>
 that he would kiss <b><i>(\phil&#275;s&#333;\)</i></b> Jesus in order to identify him for<br>
 certain. The kiss was a common mode of greeting and Judas chose<br>
 that sign and actually "kissed him fervently" <b><i>(\katephil&#275;sen\,<br>
 verse <!-#-->49)</i></b>, though the compound verb sometimes in the papyri has<br>
 lost its intensive force. Bruce thinks that Judas was prompted by<br>
 the inconsistent motives of smouldering love and cowardice. At<br>
 any rate this revolting ostentatious kiss is "the most terrible<br>
 instance of the \hekousia phil&#275;mata echthrou\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Pr 27:6)</i></b>," the<br>
 profuse kisses of an enemy <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. This same compound verb<br>
 occurs in <!-#-->Lu 7:38 of the sinful woman, in <!-#-->Lu 15:20 of the<br>
 Father's embrace of the Prodigal Son, and in <!-#-->Ac 20:37 of the<br>
 Ephesian elders and Paul.<br>
 <br>
 26:50 <B>{Do that for which thou art come}</B> <b><i>(\eph' ho parei\)</i></b>.<br>
 Moffatt and Goodspeed take it: "Do your errand." There has been a<br>
 deal of trouble over this phrase. Deissmann <b><i>(_Light from the<br>
 Ancient East_, pp. 125 to 131)</i></b> has proven conclusively that it is<br>
 a question, \eph' ho\ in late Greek having the interrogative<br>
 sense of \epi ti\ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 725)</i></b>. The use of<br>
 \eph' ho\ for "why here" occurs on a Syrian tablet of the first<br>
 century A.D. 50 that it "was current coin in the language of the<br>
 people" <b><i>(Deissmann)</i></b>. Most of the early translations <b><i>(Old Latin,<br>
 Old Syriac)</i></b> took it as a question. So the Vulgate has _ad quid<br>
 venisti_. In this instance the Authorized Version is correct<br>
 against the Revised. Jesus exposes the pretence of Judas and<br>
 shows that he does not believe in his paraded affection <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 26:51 <B>{One of them that were with Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\heis t&#333;n meta I&#275;sou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Like the other Synoptics Matthew conceals the name of Peter,<br>
 probably for prudential reasons as he was still living before<br>
 A.D. 68. John writing at the end of the century mentions Peter's<br>
 name <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:10)</i></b>. The sword or knife was one of the two that<br>
 the disciples had <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:38)</i></b>. Bruce suggests that it was a<br>
 large knife used in connexion with the paschal feast. Evidently<br>
 Peter aimed to cut off the man's head, not his ear <b><i>(\&#333;tion\ is<br>
 diminutive in form, but not in sense, as often in the _Koin&#275;_)</i></b>.<br>
 He may have been the leader of the band. His name, Malchus, is<br>
 also given by John <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:10)</i></b> because Peter was then dead and<br>
 in no danger.<br>
 <br>
 26:52 <B>{Put up again thy sword}</B> <b><i>(\apostrepson t&#275;n machairan sou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Turn back thy sword into its place. It was a stern rebuke for<br>
 Peter who had misunderstood the teaching of Jesus in <!-#-->Lu 22:38<br>
 as well as in <!-#-->Mt 5:39 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Joh 18:36)</i></b>. The reason given by<br>
 Jesus has had innumerable illustrations in human history. The<br>
 sword calls for the sword. Offensive war is here given flat<br>
 condemnation. The Paris Pact of 1928 <b><i>(the Kellogg Treaty)</i></b> is<br>
 certainly in harmony with the mind of Christ. The will to peace<br>
 is the first step towards peace, the outlawing of war. Our<br>
 American cities are often ruled by gangsters who kill each other<br>
 off.<br>
 <br>
 26:53 <B>{Even now}</B> <b><i>(\arti\)</i></b>. Just now, at this very moment.<br>
 <B>{Legions}</B> <b><i>(\legi&#333;nas\)</i></b>. A Latin word. Roman soldiers in large<br>
 numbers were in Palestine later in A.D. 66, but they were in<br>
 Caesarea and in the tower of Antonia in Jerusalem. A full Roman<br>
 legion had 6,100 foot and 726 horse in the time of Augustus. But<br>
 Jesus sees more than twelve legions at his command <b><i>(one for each<br>
 apostle)</i></b> and shows his undaunted courage in this crisis. One<br>
 should recall the story of Elisha at Dothan <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ki 6:17)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 26:54 <B>{Must be}</B> <b><i>(\dei\)</i></b>. Jesus sees clearly his destiny now that<br>
 he has won the victory in Gethsemane.<br>
 <br>
 26:55 <B>{As against a robber}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s epi l&#275;ist&#275;n\)</i></b>. As a robber, not<br>
 as a thief, but a robber hiding from justice. He will be<br>
 crucified between two robbers and on the very cross planned for<br>
 their leader, Barabbas. They have come with no warrant for any<br>
 crime, but with an armed force to seize Jesus as if a highway<br>
 robber. Jesus reminds them that he used to sit <b><i>(imperfect,<br>
 \ekathezom&#275;n\)</i></b> in the temple and teach. But he sees God's purpose<br>
 in it all for the prophets had foretold his "cup." The desertion<br>
 of Jesus by the disciples followed this rebuke of the effort of<br>
 Peter. Jesus had surrendered. So they fled.<br>
 <br>
 26:58 <B>{To see the end}</B> <b><i>(\idein to telos\)</i></b>. Peter rallied from the<br>
 panic and followed afar off <b><i>(\makrothen\)</i></b>, "more courageous than<br>
 the rest and yet not courageous enough" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. John the Beloved<br>
 Disciple went on into the room where Jesus was. The rest remained<br>
 outside, but Peter "sat with the officers" to see and hear and<br>
 hoping to escape notice.<br>
 <br>
 26:59 <B>{Sought false witness against Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\ez&#275;toun<br>
 pseudomarturian\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense, kept on seeking. Judges have<br>
 no right to be prosecutors and least of all to seek after false<br>
 witness and even to offer bribes to get it.<br>
 <br>
 26:60 <B>{They found it not}</B> <b><i>(\kai ouch heuron\)</i></b>. They found false<br>
 witnesses in plenty, but not the false witness that would stand<br>
 any sort of test.<br>
 <br>
 26:61 <B>{I am able to destroy the temple of God}</B> <b><i>(\dunamai<br>
 katalusai ton naon tou theou\)</i></b>. What he had said <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 2:19)</i></b><br>
 referred to the temple of his body which they were to destroy<br>
 <b><i>(and did)</i></b> and which he would raise again in three days as he did.<br>
 It was a pitiful perversion of what Jesus had said and even so<br>
 the two witnesses disagreed in their misrepresentation <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 14:59)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 26:63 <B>{Held his peace}</B> <b><i>(\esi&#333;pa\)</i></b>. Kept silent, imperfect tense.<br>
 Jesus refused to answer the bluster of Caiaphas. <B>{I adjure thee<br>
 by the living God}</B> <b><i>(\exorkiz&#333; se kata tou theou tou z&#333;ntos\)</i></b>. So<br>
 Caiaphas put Jesus on oath in order to make him incriminate<br>
 himself, a thing unlawful in Jewish jurisprudence. He had failed<br>
 to secure any accusation against Jesus that would stand at all.<br>
 But Jesus did not refuse to answer under solemn oath, clearly<br>
 showing that he was not thinking of oaths in courts of justice<br>
 when he prohibited profanity. The charge that Caiaphas makes is<br>
 that Jesus claims to be the Messiah, the Son of God. To refuse to<br>
 answer would be tantamount to a denial. So Jesus answered knowing<br>
 full well the use that would be made of his confession and claim.<br>
 <br>
 26:64 <B>{Thou hast said}</B> <b><i>(\su eipas\)</i></b>. This is a Greek affirmative<br>
 reply. Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:62)</i></b> has it plainly, "I am" <b><i>(\eimi\)</i></b>. But<br>
 this is not all that Jesus said to Caiaphas. He claims that the<br>
 day will come when Jesus will be the Judge and Caiaphas the<br>
 culprit using the prophetic language in <!-#-->Da 7:13 and <!-#-->Ps 109:1.<br>
 It was all that Caiaphas wanted.<br>
 <br>
 26:65 <B>{He hath spoken blasphemy}</B> <b><i>(\eblasph&#275;m&#275;sen\)</i></b>. There was no<br>
 need of witnesses now, for Jesus had incriminated himself by<br>
 claiming under oath to be the Messiah, the Son of God. Now it<br>
 would not be blasphemy for the real Messiah to make such a claim,<br>
 but it was intolerable to admit that Jesus could be the Messiah<br>
 of Jewish hope. At the beginning of Christ's ministry he<br>
 occasionally used the word Messiah of himself, but he soon<br>
 ceased, for it was plain that it would create trouble. The people<br>
 would take it in the sense of a political revolutionist who would<br>
 throw off the Roman yoke. If he declined that role, the Pharisees<br>
 would have none of him for that was the kind of a Messiah that<br>
 they desired. But the hour has now come. At the Triumphal Entry<br>
 Jesus let the Galilean crowds hail him as Messiah, knowing what<br>
 the effect would be. Now the hour has struck. He has made his<br>
 claim and has defied the High Priest.<br>
 <br>
 26:66 <B>{He is worthy of death}</B> <b><i>(\enochos thanatou estin\)</i></b>. Held in<br>
 the bonds of death <b><i>(\en, ech&#333;\)</i></b> as actually guilty with the<br>
 genitive <b><i>(\thanatou\)</i></b>. The dative expresses liability as in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 5:21 <b><i>(\t&#275;i krisei\)</i></b> and as \eis\ and the accusative <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:22)</i></b>.<br>
 They took the vote though it was at night and they no longer had<br>
 the power of death since the Romans took it away from them. Death<br>
 was the penalty of blasphemy <b><i>(<!-#-->Le 24:15)</i></b>. But they enjoyed<br>
 taking it as their answer to his unanswerable speeches in the<br>
 temple that dreadful Tuesday a few days before. It was unanimous<br>
 save that Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus did not agree. They<br>
 were probably absent and not even invited as being under<br>
 suspicion for being secret disciples of Christ.<br>
 <br>
 26:68 <B>{Thou Christ}</B> <b><i>(\Christe\)</i></b>. With definite sneer at his<br>
 claims under oath in <!-#-->26:63. With uncontrolled glee and abandon<br>
 like a lot of hoodlums these doctors of divinity insulted Jesus.<br>
 They actually spat in his face, buffeted him on the neck<br>
 <b><i>(\ekolaphisan\, from \kolaphos\ the fist)</i></b>, and struck him in the<br>
 face with the palms of their hands <b><i>(\erapisan\, from \rapis\, a<br>
 rod)</i></b>, all personal indignities after the legal injustice already<br>
 done. They thus gave vent to their spite and hatred.<br>
 <br>
 26:69 <B>{Thou also}</B> <b><i>(\kai su\)</i></b>. Peter had gone within <b><i>(\es&#333;\)</i></b> the<br>
 palace <b><i>(<!-#-->26:58)</i></b>, but was sitting <B>{without}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#333;\)</i></b> the hall<br>
 where the trial was going on in the open central court with the<br>
 servants or officers <b><i>(\hup&#275;ret&#333;n\, under rowers, literally,<br>
 <!-#-->26:58)</i></b> of the Sanhedrin. But he could possibly see through the<br>
 open door above what was going on inside. It is not plain at what<br>
 stage of the Jewish trial the denials of Peter took place nor the<br>
 precise order in which they came as the Gospels give them<br>
 variously. This maid <b><i>(\paidisk&#275;\, slave girl)</i></b> stepped up to Peter<br>
 as he was sitting in the court and pointedly said: "Thou also<br>
 wast with Jesus the Galilean." Peter was warming himself by the<br>
 fire and the light shone in his face. She probably had noticed<br>
 Peter come in with John the Beloved Disciple who went on up into<br>
 the hall of trial. Or she may have seen Peter with Jesus on the<br>
 streets of Jerusalem.<br>
 <br>
 26:70 <B>{I know not what thou sayest}</B> <b><i>(\ouk oida ti legeis\)</i></b>. It<br>
 was an affectation of extreme ignorance <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b> that deceived no<br>
 one. It was an easy and ancient dodge and easy subterfuge. Dalman<br>
 <b><i>(_Words of Jesus_, 80f.)</i></b> suggests that Peter used the Galilean<br>
 Aramaean word for know instead of the Judean Aramaean word which<br>
 betrayed at once his Galilean residence.<br>
 <br>
 26:71 <B>{Into the porch}</B> <b><i>(\eis ton pul&#333;na\)</i></b>. But Peter was not safe<br>
 out here, for another maid recognized him and spoke of him as<br>
 "this fellow" <b><i>(\houtos\)</i></b> with a gesture to those out there.<br>
 <br>
 26:72 <B>{With an oath}</B> <b><i>(\meta horkou\)</i></b>. This time Peter added an<br>
 oath, probably a former habit so common to the Jews at that time,<br>
 and denied acquaintance with Jesus. He even refers to Jesus as<br>
 "the man" <b><i>(\ton anthr&#333;pon\)</i></b>, an expression that could convey<br>
 contempt, "the fellow."<br>
 <br>
 26:73 <B>{They that stood by}</B> <b><i>(\hoi hest&#333;tes\)</i></b>. The talk about Peter<br>
 continued. Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:59)</i></b> states that the little while was<br>
 about an hour. The bystanders came up to Peter and bluntly assert<br>
 that he was "of a truth" <b><i>(\al&#275;th&#333;s\)</i></b> one of the followers of<br>
 Jesus for his speech betrayed him. Even the Revised Version<br>
 retains "bewrayeth," quaint old English for "betrayeth." The<br>
 Greek has it simply "makes thee evident" <b><i>(\d&#275;lon se poiei\)</i></b>. His<br>
 dialect <b><i>(\lalia\)</i></b> clearly revealed that he was a Galilean. The<br>
 Galileans had difficulty with the gutterals and Peter's second<br>
 denial had exposed him to the tormenting raillery of the loungers<br>
 who continued to nag him.<br>
 <br>
 26:74 <B>{Then began he to curse and to swear}</B> <b><i>(\tote &#275;rxato<br>
 katathematizein kai omnuein\)</i></b>. He repeated his denial with the<br>
 addition of profanity to prove that he was telling the truth<br>
 instead of the lie that they all knew. His repeated denials gave<br>
 him away still more, for he could not pronounce the Judean<br>
 gutterals. He called down on himself <b><i>(\katathematizein\)</i></b><br>
 imprecations in his desperate irritation and loss of self-control<br>
 at his exposure. <B>{The cock crew}</B> <b><i>(\alekt&#333;n eph&#333;n&#275;sen\)</i></b>. No<br>
 article in the Greek, just "a cock crew" at that juncture,<br>
 "straightway" <b><i>(\euthus\)</i></b>. But it startled Peter.<br>
 <br>
 26:75 <B>{Peter remembered}</B> <b><i>(\emn&#275;sth&#275; ho Petros\)</i></b>. A small thing,<br>
 but _magna circumstantia_ <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>. In a flash of lightning<br>
 rapidity he recalled the words of Jesus a few hours before <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 26:34)</i></b> which he had then scouted with the proud boast that "even<br>
 if I must die with thee, yet will I not deny thee" <b><i>(<!-#-->26:35)</i></b>. And<br>
 now this triple denial was a fact. There is no extenuation for<br>
 the base denials of Peter. He had incurred the dread penalty<br>
 involved in the words of Jesus in <!-#-->Mt 10:33 of denial by Jesus<br>
 before the Father in heaven. But Peter's revulsion of feeling was<br>
 as sudden as his sin. <B>{He went out and wept bitterly}</B> <b><i>(\exelth&#333;n<br>
 ex&#333; eklausen pikr&#333;s\)</i></b>. Luke adds that the Lord turned and looked<br>
 upon Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:61)</i></b>. That look brought Peter back to his<br>
 senses. He could not stay where he now was with the revilers of<br>
 Jesus. He did not feel worthy or able to go openly into the hall<br>
 where Jesus was. So outside he went with a broken heart. The<br>
 constative aorist here does not emphasize as Mark's imperfect<br>
 does <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:72, \eklaien\)</i></b> the continued weeping that was now<br>
 Peter's only consolation. The tears were bitter, all the more so<br>
 by reason of that look of understanding pity that Jesus gave him.<br>
 One of the tragedies of the Cross is the bleeding heart of Peter.<br>
 Judas was a total wreck and Peter was a near derelict. Satan had<br>
 sifted them all as wheat, but Jesus had prayed specially for<br>
 Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:31f.)</i></b>. Will Satan show Peter to be all chaff as<br>
 Judas was?<br>
