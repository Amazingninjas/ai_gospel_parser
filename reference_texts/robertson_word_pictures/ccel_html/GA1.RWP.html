<p>1:1 <B>{Not from men, neither through men}</B> <b><i>(\ouk ap' anthr&#333;p&#333;n oude<br>
 di' anthr&#333;pou\)</i></b>. The bluntness of Paul's denial is due to the<br>
 charge made by the Judaizers that Paul was not a genuine apostle<br>
 because not one of the twelve. This charge had been made in<br>
 Corinth and called forth the keenest irony of Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 10-12)</i></b>.<br>
 In <!-#-->Ga 1; 2 Paul proves his independence of the twelve and his<br>
 equality with them as recognized by them. Paul denies that his<br>
 apostleship had a human source <b><i>(\ouk ap' anthr&#333;p&#333;n\)</i></b> and that it<br>
 had come to him through <b><i>(\di' anthr&#333;pou\)</i></b> a human channel<br>
 <b><i>(Burton)</i></b>. <B>{But through Jesus Christ and God the Father}</B> <b><i>(\alla<br>
 dia I&#275;sou Christou kai theou patros\)</i></b>. The call to be an apostle<br>
 came to Paul through Jesus Christ as he claimed in <!-#-->1Co 9:1 and<br>
 as told in <!-#-->Ac 9:4-6; 22:7ff.; 26:16ff. He is apostle also by<br>
 the will of God. <B>{Who raised him from the dead}</B> <b><i>(\tou egeirantos<br>
 auton ek nekr&#333;n\)</i></b>. And therefore Paul was qualified to be an<br>
 apostle since he had seen the Risen Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 9:1; 15:8f.)</i></b>.<br>
 This verb \egeir&#333;\ is often used in N.T. for raising from the<br>
 sleep of death, to wake up the dead.<br>
 <br>
 1:2 <B>{All the brethren which are with me}</B> <b><i>(\hoi sun emoi pantes<br>
 adelphoi\)</i></b>. The same phrase in <!-#-->Php 4:21 in distinction from the<br>
 saints in verse <!-#-->22. Probably the small company of travelling<br>
 companions. <B>{Unto the churches of Galatia}</B> <b><i>(\tais ekkl&#275;siais t&#275;s<br>
 Galatias\)</i></b>. A circular letter therefore to all the churches in<br>
 the province <b><i>(both South Galatia and North Galatia if he really<br>
 laboured there)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:3 <B>{Grace to you and peace}</B> <b><i>(\charis humin kai eir&#275;n&#275;\)</i></b>. As in I<br>
 Thess., II Thess., I Cor., II Cor. <b><i>(already written)</i></b> and in all<br>
 the later Epistles save that in I and II Timothy "mercy" is<br>
 added. But this customary salutation <b><i>(see on &#175;1Th 1:1)</i></b> is not a<br>
 perfunctory thing with Paul. He uses it here even when he has so<br>
 much fault to find just as he did in I and II Corinthians.<br>
 <br>
 1:4 <B>{For our sins}</B> <b><i>(\huper t&#333;n hamarti&#333;n\)</i></b>. Some MSS. have \peri\<br>
 <b><i>(concerning)</i></b>. In the _Koin&#275;_ this use of \huper\ as like \peri\<br>
 has come to be common. He refers to the death of Christ <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1Co<br>
 15:3; Ga 2:20; Ro 5:6f.)</i></b>. As a rule \peri\ occurs of things,<br>
 \huper\ of persons. <B>{Deliver}</B> <b><i>(\exel&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle<br>
 subjunctive <b><i>(final clause with \hop&#333;s\)</i></b> of \exaire&#333;\, old verb to<br>
 pluck out, to rescue <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 23:27)</i></b>. "Strikes the keynote of the<br>
 epistle. The gospel is a rescue, an emancipation from a state of<br>
 bondage" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. <B>{Out of this present evil world}</B> <b><i>(\ek tou<br>
 ai&#333;nos tou enest&#333;tos pon&#275;rou\)</i></b>. Literally, "out of the age the<br>
 existing one being evil." The predicate position of \pon&#275;rou\<br>
 calls emphatic attention to it. Each word here is of interest and<br>
 has been already discussed. See on &#175;Mt 13:22 for \ai&#333;n\, <!-#-->Mt<br>
 6:23 for \pon&#275;ros\. \Enest&#333;tos\ is genitive masculine singular<br>
 of \enest&#333;s\ second perfect <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b> participle of<br>
 \enist&#275;mi\ for which see on &#175;2Th 2:12; 1Co 3:22; 7:26. It is<br>
 present as related to future <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 8:38; Heb 9:9)</i></b>. <B>{According to<br>
 the will of God}</B> <b><i>(\kata to thel&#275;ma tou theou\)</i></b>. Not according to<br>
 any merit in us.<br>
 <br>
 1:5 <B>{To whom be the glory}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;i h&#275; doxa\)</i></b>. No verb in the Greek.<br>
 For like doxologies see <!-#-->Ro 9:5; 11:36; 16:27; Eph 3:21; 1Ti<br>
 1:17.<br>
 <br>
 1:6 <B>{Ye are so quickly removing}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s tache&#333;s<br>
 metatithesthe\)</i></b>. The present middle indicative of \metatith&#275;mi\,<br>
 to change places, to transfer. "You are transferring yourselves"<br>
 and doing it "so quickly" either from the time of their<br>
 conversion or most likely from the time when the Judaizers came<br>
 and tempted them. So easily some of them are falling victims to<br>
 these perverters of the gospel. That is a continuous amazement<br>
 <b><i>(\thaumaz&#333;\)</i></b> to Paul and to men today that so many are so silly<br>
 and so gullible to modern as to ancient charlatans. <B>{Unto a<br>
 different gospel}</B> <b><i>(\eis heteron euaggelion\)</i></b>. See on &#175;2Co 11:4<br>
 for distinction between \allo\ and \heteron\ as here. It is not<br>
 here or there a mere difference in emphasis or spirit as in &#175;Php<br>
 1:18 so long as Christ is preached. These men as in <!-#-->2Co 11:4<br>
 preach "another Jesus" and a "different gospel" and so have<br>
 fallen away from grace and have done away with Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 5:4)</i></b>.<br>
 Hence the vehemence of Paul's words.<br>
 <br>
 1:7 <B>{Which is not another}</B> <b><i>(\ho ouk estin allo\)</i></b>. It is no<br>
 "gospel" <b><i>(good news)</i></b> at all, but a yoke of bondage to the law and<br>
 the abolition of grace. There is but one gospel and that is of<br>
 grace, not works. The relative \ho\ <b><i>(which)</i></b> refers to \heteron<br>
 euaggelion\ <b><i>(a different gospel)</i></b> "taken as a single term and<br>
 designating the erroneous teachings of the Judaizers" <b><i>(Burton)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Only}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275;\)</i></b>. Literally, "except," that is, "Except in this<br>
 sense," "in that it is an attempt to pervert the one true gospel"<br>
 <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. <B>{Who disturb you}</B> <b><i>(\hoi tarassontes\)</i></b>. The<br>
 disturbers. This very verb \tarass&#333;\ is used in <!-#-->Ac 17:8 of the<br>
 Jews in Thessalonica who "disturbed" the politarchs and the<br>
 people about Paul. <B>{Would pervert}</B> <b><i>(\thelontes metastrepsai\)</i></b>.<br>
 "Wish to turn about," change completely as in <!-#-->Ac 2:20; Jas 4:9.<br>
 The very existence of the gospel of Christ was at stake.<br>
 <br>
 1:8 <B>{If we}</B> <b><i>(\ean h&#275;meis\)</i></b>. Condition of third class <b><i>(\ean\ and<br>
 aorist middle subjunctive \euaggelis&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Suppose I <b><i>(literary<br>
 plural)</i></b> should turn renegade and preach "other than" <b><i>(\par' ho\)</i></b>,<br>
 "contrary to that which we preached." Preachers have turned away<br>
 from Christ, alas, and preached "humanism" or some other<br>
 new-fangled notion. The Jews termed Paul a renegade for leaving<br>
 Judaism for Christianity. But it was before Paul had seen Christ<br>
 that he clung to the law. Paul is dogmatic and positive here, for<br>
 he knows that he is standing upon solid ground, the fact of<br>
 Christ dying for us and rising again. He had seen the Risen Jesus<br>
 Christ. No angel can change Paul now. <B>{Let him be anathema}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anathema est&#333;\)</i></b>. See on &#175;1Co 12:3 for this word.<br>
 <br>
 1:9 <B>{So say I now again}</B> <b><i>(\kai arti palin leg&#333;\)</i></b>. Paul knows that<br>
 he has just made what some will consider an extreme statement.<br>
 But it is a deliberate one and not mere excitement. He will stand<br>
 by it to the end. He calls down a curse on any one who proclaims<br>
 a gospel to them contrary to that which they had received from<br>
 him.<br>
 <br>
 1:10 <B>{Am I persuading?}</B> <b><i>(\peith&#333;?\)</i></b>. Conative present, trying to<br>
 persuade like \z&#275;t&#333; areskein\ <b><i>(seeking to please)</i></b> where the<br>
 effort is stated plainly. See <!-#-->2Co 5:11. <B>{I should not be}</B> <b><i>(\ouk<br>
 an &#275;m&#275;n\)</i></b>. Conclusion of second class condition, determined as<br>
 unfulfilled. Regular construction here <b><i>(\ei\ and imperfect<br>
 indicative in the condition \&#275;reskon, ouk an\ and imperfect in<br>
 the conclusion)</i></b>. About pleasing men see on &#175;1Th 2:4. In <!-#-->Col<br>
 3:22; Eph. 6:6 Paul uses the word "men-pleasers"<br>
 <b><i>(\anthr&#333;pareskoi\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:11 <B>{Which was preached}</B> <b><i>(\to euaggelisthen\)</i></b>. Play on the word<br>
 \euaggelion\ by first aorist passive participle of \euaggeliz&#333;\,<br>
 "the gospel which was gospelized by me." <B>{It is not after man}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ouk estin kata anthr&#333;pon\)</i></b>. Not after a human standard and so<br>
 he does not try to conform to the human ideal. Paul alone <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 3:3; 9:8; 15:32; Ro 3:15)</i></b> in the N.T. uses this old and common<br>
 idiom.<br>
 <br>
 1:12 <B>{Nor was I taught it}</B> <b><i>(\oute edidachth&#275;n\)</i></b>. He did not<br>
 receive it "from man" <b><i>(\para anthr&#333;p&#333;n\, which shuts out both<br>
 \apo\ and \dia\ of verse <!-#-->1)</i></b>, whether Peter or any other<br>
 apostle, nor was he taught it in the school of Gamaliel in<br>
 Jerusalem or at the University of Tarsus. He "received" his<br>
 gospel in one way, "through revelation of Jesus Christ" <b><i>(\di'<br>
 apokalupse&#333;s I&#275;sou Christou\)</i></b>. He used \parelabon\ in <!-#-->1Co 15:3<br>
 about the reception of his message from Christ. It is not<br>
 necessary to say that he had only one <b><i>(because of the aorist<br>
 active \parelabon\, from \paralamban&#333;\, for it can very well be<br>
 constative aorist)</i></b> revelation <b><i>(unveiling)</i></b> from Christ. In fact,<br>
 we know that he had numerous visions of Christ and in <!-#-->1Co 11:23<br>
 he expressly says concerning the origin of the Lord's Supper: "I<br>
 received <b><i>(\parelabon\, again)</i></b> from the Lord." The Lord Jesus<br>
 revealed his will to Paul.<br>
 <br>
 1:13 <B>{My manner of life}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n em&#275;n anastroph&#275;n\)</i></b>. Late word in<br>
 this sense from Polybius on from \anastrephomai\. In the older<br>
 writers it meant literally "return" or "turning back." See <!-#-->1Pe<br>
 1:15. It is absent in this sense in the papyri though the verb<br>
 is common. <B>{In the Jews' religion}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i Ioudaism&#333;i\)</i></b>. "In<br>
 Judaism." The word in N.T. only here and next verse, already in<br>
 II Macc. 2:21; 8:1; 14:38; IV Macc. 4:26. In these passages it<br>
 means the Jewish religion as opposed to the Hellenism that the<br>
 Syrian Kings were imposing upon the Jews. So later Justin Martyr<br>
 <b><i>(386 D)</i></b> will use \Christianismos\ for Christianity. Both words<br>
 are made from verbs in \-iz&#333;\. <B>{Beyond measure}</B> <b><i>(\kath'<br>
 huperbol&#275;n\)</i></b>. "According to excess" <b><i>(throwing beyond,<br>
 \huperbol&#275;\)</i></b>. <B>{I persecuted}</B> <b><i>(\edi&#333;kon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, "I<br>
 used to persecute" <b><i>(see <!-#-->Ac 7-9 for the facts)</i></b>. <B>{Made havock of<br>
 it}</B> <b><i>(\eporthoun aut&#275;n\)</i></b>. Customary action again, imperfect of old<br>
 verb \porthe&#333;\, to lay waste, to sack. In N.T. only here, verse<br>
 <!-#-->23, and <!-#-->Ac 9:31 <b><i>(used by Christians in Damascus of Saul after<br>
 his conversion of his former conduct, the very word of Paul<br>
 here)</i></b>. Paul heard them use it of him and it stuck in his mind.<br>
 <br>
 1:14 <B>{I advanced}</B> <b><i>(\proekopton\)</i></b>. Imperfect active again of<br>
 \prokopt&#333;\, old verb, to cut forward <b><i>(as in a forest)</i></b>, to blaze a<br>
 way, to go ahead. In N.T. only here, <!-#-->Ro 13:12; 2Ti 2:16;<br>
 3:9,13. Paul was a brilliant pupil under Gamaliel. See <!-#-->Php<br>
 3:4-6. He was in the lead of the persecution also. <B>{Beyond many<br>
 of mine own age}</B> <b><i>(\huper pollous sun&#275;liki&#333;tas\)</i></b>. Later compound<br>
 form for the Attic \h&#275;liki&#333;t&#275;s\ which occurs in Dion Hal. and<br>
 inscriptions <b><i>(from \sun\, with, and \h&#275;likia\, age)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 modestly claims that he went "beyond" <b><i>(\huper\)</i></b> his<br>
 fellow-students in his progress in Judaism. <B>{More exceedingly<br>
 zealous}</B> <b><i>(\perissoter&#333;s z&#275;lot&#275;s\)</i></b>. Literally, "more exceedingly a<br>
 zealot." See on &#175;Ac 1:13; 21:20; 1Co 14:12. Like Simon Zelotes.<br>
 <B>{For the traditions of my fathers}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n patrik&#333;n mou<br>
 paradose&#333;n\)</i></b>. Objective genitive after \z&#275;lot&#275;s\. \Patrik&#333;n\ only<br>
 here in N.T., though old word from \pat&#275;r\ <b><i>(father)</i></b>, paternal,<br>
 descending from one's father. For \patr&#333;ios\ see <!-#-->Ac 22:3,14.<br>
 Tradition <b><i>(\paradosis\)</i></b> played a large part in the teaching and<br>
 life of the Pharisees <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 7:1-23)</i></b>. Paul now taught the<br>
 Christian tradition <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 2:15)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:15 <B>{It was the good pleasure of God}</B> <b><i>(\eudok&#275;sen ho theos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul had no doubt about God's purpose in him <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 2:8)</i></b>. <B>{Who<br>
 separated me}</B> <b><i>(\ho aphorisas me\)</i></b>. \Aphoriz&#333;\ is old word <b><i>(from<br>
 \apo\ and \horos\)</i></b> to mark off from a boundary or line. The<br>
 Pharisees were the separatists who held themselves off from<br>
 others. Paul conceives himself as a spiritual Pharisee "separated<br>
 unto the gospel of God" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:1, the same word \aph&#333;rismenos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Before his birth God had his plans for him and called him.<br>
 <br>
 1:16 <B>{To reveal his Son in me}</B> <b><i>(\apokalupsai ton huion autou en<br>
 emoi\)</i></b>. By "in me" <b><i>(\en emoi\)</i></b> Paul can mean to lay emphasis on<br>
 his inward experience of grace or he may refer objectively to the<br>
 vision of Christ on the way to Damascus, "in my case." Paul uses<br>
 \en emoi\ in this sense <b><i>(in my case)</i></b> several times <b><i>(verse <!-#-->24;<br>
 2Co 13:3; Php 1:30; 1Ti 1:16)</i></b>. Once <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 14:11)</i></b> \en emoi\ is<br>
 almost equivalent to the dative <b><i>(to me)</i></b>. On the whole Lightfoot<br>
 seems correct here in taking it to mean "in my case," though the<br>
 following words suit either idea. Certainly Paul could not preach<br>
 Christ among the Gentiles without the rich inward experience and<br>
 in the objective vision he was called to that task. <B>{I conferred<br>
 not with flesh and blood}</B> <b><i>(\ou prosanethem&#275;n sarki kai haimati\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist middle indicative of \prosanatith&#275;mi\, old verb,<br>
 double compound <b><i>(\pros, ana\)</i></b>, to lay upon oneself in addition,<br>
 to betake oneself to another, to confer with, dative case as<br>
 here. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->2:6.<br>
 <br>
 1:17 <B>{Before me}</B> <b><i>(\pro emou\)</i></b>. The Jerusalem apostles were<br>
 genuine apostles, but so is Paul. His call did not come from them<br>
 nor did he receive confirmation by them. <B>{Into Arabia}</B> <b><i>(\eis<br>
 Arabian\)</i></b>. This visit to Arabia has to come between the two<br>
 visits to Damascus which are not distinguished in <!-#-->Ac 9:22f. In<br>
 verse <!-#-->23 Luke does speak of "considerable days" and so we must<br>
 place the visit to Arabia between verses <!-#-->22,23.<br>
 <br>
 1:18 <B>{Then after three years}</B> <b><i>(\epeita meta tria et&#275;\)</i></b>. A round<br>
 number to cover the period from his departure from Jerusalem for<br>
 Damascus to his return to Jerusalem. This stay in Damascus was an<br>
 important episode in Paul's theological readjustment to his new<br>
 experience. <B>{To visit Cephas}</B> <b><i>(\histor&#275;sai K&#275;ph&#257;n\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 infinitive of \histore&#333;\, old verb <b><i>(from \hist&#333;r\, one who knows<br>
 by inquiry)</i></b>, to gain knowledge by visiting. Only here in N.T. If<br>
 we turn to <!-#-->Ac 9:26-30, we shall see that the visit of two weeks<br>
 to Peter came after Barnabas endorsed Paul to the suspicious<br>
 disciples in Jerusalem and probably while he was preaching in the<br>
 city. It was a delightful experience, but Peter did not start<br>
 Paul upon his apostleship. He visited him as an equal. Peter no<br>
 doubt had much to say to Paul.<br>
 <br>
 1:19 <B>{Except James the brother of the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275; Iak&#333;bon ton<br>
 adelphon tou Kuriou\)</i></b>. James the son of Zebedee was still living<br>
 at that time. The rest of the twelve were probably away preaching<br>
 and James, brother of the Lord, is here termed an apostle, though<br>
 not one of the twelve as Barnabas is later so called. Paul is<br>
 showing his independence of and equality with the twelve in<br>
 answer to the attacks of the Judaizers.<br>
 <br>
 1:20 <B>{I lie not}</B> <b><i>(\ou pseudomai\)</i></b>. So important does he deem the<br>
 point that he takes solemn oath about it.<br>
 <br>
 1:21 <B>{Into the region of Syria and Cilicia}</B> <b><i>(\eis ta klimata t&#275;s<br>
 Syrias kai t&#275;s Kilikias\)</i></b>. This statement agrees with the record<br>
 in <!-#-->Ac 9:30. On \klimata\, see <!-#-->2Co 11:10. Paul was not idle,<br>
 but at work in Tarsus and the surrounding country.<br>
 <br>
 1:22 <B>{And I was still unknown}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;m&#275;n de agnoumenos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic imperfect passive of \agnoe&#333;\, not to know. <B>{By<br>
 face}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i pros&#333;p&#333;i\)</i></b>. Associative instrumental case. <B>{Of Judea}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\t&#275;s Ioudaias\)</i></b>. As distinct from Jerusalem, for he had once<br>
 scattered the church there and had revisited them before coming<br>
 to Tarsus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 9:26-30)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Ac 9:31 the singular of \ekkl&#275;sia\<br>
 is used, but in a geographic sense for Judea, Samaria, and<br>
 Galilee.<br>
 <br>
 1:23 <B>{They only heard}</B> <b><i>(\monon akouontes &#275;san\)</i></b>. Periphrastic<br>
 imperfect, "They were only hearing from time to time." <B>{That once<br>
 persecuted us}</B> <b><i>(\ho di&#333;k&#333;n h&#275;mas pote\)</i></b>. Present active articular<br>
 participle, a sort of participle of antecedent time suggested by<br>
 \pote\, "the one who used to persecute us once upon a time." <B>{The<br>
 faith}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n pistin\)</i></b>. Here used in the sense of "the gospel" as<br>
 in <!-#-->Ac 6:7.<br>
 <br>
 1:24 <B>{They glorified}</B> <b><i>(\edoxazon\)</i></b>. Imperfect, kept on doing it.<br>
 <B>{In me}</B> <b><i>(\en emoi\)</i></b>. In my case as in <!-#-->1:16.<br>
