<p>18:1 <B>{Who then is greatest}</B> <b><i>(\tis ara meiz&#333;n estin\)</i></b>. The \ara\<br>
 seems to point back to the tax-collection incident when Jesus had<br>
 claimed exemption for them all as "sons" of the Father. But it<br>
 was not a new dispute, for jealousy had been growing in their<br>
 hearts. The wonderful words of Jesus to Peter on Mount Hermon<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 16:17-19)</i></b> had evidently made Peter feel a fresh sense of<br>
 leadership on the basis of which he had dared even to rebuke<br>
 Jesus for speaking of his death <b><i>(<!-#-->16:22)</i></b>. And then Peter was one<br>
 of the three <b><i>(James and John also)</i></b> taken with the Master up on<br>
 the Mount of Transfiguration. Peter on that occasion had spoken<br>
 up promptly. And just now the tax-collectors had singled out<br>
 Peter as the one who seemed to represent the group. Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 9:33)</i></b> represents Jesus as asking them about their dispute on the<br>
 way into the house, perhaps just after their question in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 18:1. Jesus had noticed the wrangling. It will break out again<br>
 and again <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 20:20-28; Lu 22:24)</i></b>. Plainly the primacy of Peter<br>
 was not yet admitted by the others. The use of the comparative<br>
 \meiz&#333;n\ <b><i>(so \ho meiz&#333;n\ in verse <!-#-->4)</i></b> rather than the<br>
 superlative \megistos\ is quite in accord with the _Koin&#275;_ idiom<br>
 where the comparative is displacing the superlative <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, pp. 667ff.)</i></b>. But it is a sad discovery to find the<br>
 disciples chiefly concerned about their own places <b><i>(offices)</i></b> in<br>
 the political kingdom which they were expecting.<br>
 <br>
 18:2 <B>{Called to him}</B> <b><i>(\proskalesamenos\)</i></b>. Indirect middle voice<br>
 aorist participle. It may even be Peter's "little child"<br>
 <b><i>(\paidion\)</i></b> as it was probably in Peter's house <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 9:33)</i></b>. <B>{Set<br>
 him}</B> <b><i>(\est&#275;sen\)</i></b>. Transitive first aorist active indicative, not<br>
 intransitive second aorist, \est&#275;\. <B>{In the midst of them}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 mes&#333;i aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Luke adds <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:47)</i></b> "by his side" <b><i>(\par'<br>
 heaut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Both are true.<br>
 <br>
 18:3 <B>{Except ye turn and become}</B> <b><i>(\ean m&#275; straph&#275;te kai<br>
 gen&#275;sthe\)</i></b>. Third-class condition, undetermined but with prospect<br>
 of determination. \Straph&#275;te\ is second aorist passive<br>
 subjunctive and \gen&#275;sthe\ second aorist middle subjunctive. They<br>
 were headed in the wrong direction with their selfish ambition.<br>
 "His tone at this time is markedly severe, as much as when He<br>
 denounces the Pharisaism in the bud He had to deal with" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 The strong double negative \ou m&#275; eiselth&#275;te\ means that they<br>
 will otherwise not get into the kingdom of heaven at all, let<br>
 alone have big places in it.<br>
 <br>
 18:4 <B>{This little child}</B> <b><i>(\to paidion touto\)</i></b>. This saying about<br>
 humbling oneself Jesus repeated a number of times as for instance<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 23:12. Probably Jesus pointed to the child by his side.<br>
 The ninth-century story that the child was Ignatius is worthless.<br>
 It is not that the child humbled himself, but that the child is<br>
 humble from the nature of the case in relation to older persons.<br>
 That is true, however "bumptious" the child himself may be. Bruce<br>
 observes that to humble oneself is "the most difficult thing in<br>
 the world for saint as for sinner."<br>
 <br>
 18:5 <B>{In my name}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#333;i onomati mou\)</i></b>. For "one such little<br>
 child" <b><i>(\any believer in Christ\)</i></b> Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:48)</i></b> has "this<br>
 little child" as a representative or symbol. "On the basis or<br>
 ground of my name," "for my sake." Very much like \eis onoma\ in<br>
 <!-#-->10:41 which does not differ greatly from \en onomati\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 10:48)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:6 <B>{These little ones}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n mikr&#333;n tout&#333;n\)</i></b>. In the same sense<br>
 as "one such little one" above. The child is the type of<br>
 believers. <B>{A great millstone}</B> <b><i>(\mulos onikos\)</i></b>, literally, "a<br>
 millstone turned by an ass." The upper millstone was turned by an<br>
 ass <b><i>(\onos\)</i></b>. There were no examples of the adjective \onikos\<br>
 <b><i>(turned by an ass)</i></b> outside the N.T. until the papyri revealed<br>
 several for loads requiring an ass to carry them, stones<br>
 requiring an ass to move them, etc. Deissmann <b><i>(_Light from the<br>
 Ancient East_, p. 81)</i></b> notes it also in papyri examples about the<br>
 sale of an ass and tax for an ass's burden of goods. <B>{The depth<br>
 of the sea}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i pelagei t&#275;s thalass&#275;s\)</i></b>. "The sea of the sea."<br>
 \Pelagos\ probably from \pl&#275;sso\, to beat, and so the beating,<br>
 splashing waves of the sea. "Far out into the open sea, a vivid<br>
 substitute for \eis t&#275;n thalassan\" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:7 <B>{Through whom}</B> <b><i>(\di' ou\)</i></b>. Jesus recognizes the<br>
 inevitableness of stumbling-blocks, traps, hindrances, the world<br>
 being as it is, but he does not absolve the man who sets the trap<br>
 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Lu 17:1)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:8 In verses <!-#-->8 and <!-#-->9 we have one of the dualities or<br>
 doublets in Matthew <b><i>(<!-#-->5:29-30)</i></b>. Jesus repeated his pungent<br>
 sayings many times. Instead of \eis geennan\ <b><i>(<!-#-->5:29)</i></b> we have<br>
 \eis to pur to ai&#333;nion\ and at the end of verse <!-#-->9 \tou puros\<br>
 is added to \t&#275;n geennan\. This is the first use in Matthew of<br>
 \ai&#333;nios\. We have it again in <!-#-->19:16,29 with \zo&#275;\, in <!-#-->25:41<br>
 with \pur\, in <!-#-->25:46 with \kolasin\ and \zo&#275;n\. The word means<br>
 ageless, without beginning or end as of God <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 16:26)</i></b>, without<br>
 beginning as in <!-#-->Ro 16:25, without end as here and often. The<br>
 effort to make it mean "\aeonian\" fire will make it mean<br>
 "\aeonian\" life also. If the punishment is limited, _ipso facto_<br>
 the life is shortened. In verse <!-#-->9 also \monophthalmon\ occurs.<br>
 It is an Ionic compound in Herodotus that is condemned by the<br>
 Atticists, but it is revived in the vernacular _Koin&#275;_. Literally<br>
 one-eyed. Here only and <!-#-->Mr 9:47 in the New Testament.<br>
 <br>
 18:10 <B>{Despise}</B> <b><i>(\kataphron&#275;s&#275;te\)</i></b>. Literally, "think down on,"<br>
 with the assumption of superiority. <B>{Their angels}</B> <b><i>(\hoi aggeloi<br>
 aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. The Jews believed that each nation had a guardian angel<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Da 10:13,20f.; 12:1)</i></b>. The seven churches in Revelation <b><i>(<!-#-->Re<br>
 1:20)</i></b> have angels, each of them, whatsoever the meaning is. Does<br>
 Jesus mean to teach here that each little child or child of faith<br>
 had a special angel who appears in God's presence, "see the face<br>
 of my Father" <b><i>(\blepousin to pros&#333;pon tou patros mou\)</i></b> in special<br>
 intimacy? Or does he simply mean that the angels do take an<br>
 interest in the welfare of God's people <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 1:14)</i></b>? There is<br>
 comfort to us in that thought. Certainly Jesus means that the<br>
 Father takes special care of his "little ones" who believe in<br>
 Him. There are angels in God's presence <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:19)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:12 <B>{Leave the ninety and nine}</B> <b><i>(\aph&#275;sei ta enen&#275;konta ennea<br>
 epi ta or&#275; kai poreutheis z&#275;tei to plan&#333;menon?\)</i></b>. This is the<br>
 text of Westcott and Hort after BL, etc. This text means: "Will<br>
 he not leave the ninety and nine upon the mountains and going<br>
 does he not seek <b><i>(change to present tense)</i></b> the wandering one?" On<br>
 the high pastures where the sheep graze at will one has wandered<br>
 afield. See this parable later in <!-#-->Lu 15:4-7. Our word "planet"<br>
 is from \planaomai\, wandering <b><i>(moving)</i></b> stars they were called as<br>
 opposed to fixed stars. But now we know that no stars are fixed.<br>
 They are all moving and rapidly.<br>
 <br>
 18:14 <B>{The will of your Father}</B> <b><i>(\thel&#275;ma emprosthen\)</i></b>. Observe<br>
 that Westcott and Hort read \mou\ here rather than \h&#8211;m&#333;n\ after<br>
 B Sahidic Coptic. Either makes good sense, though "your" carries<br>
 on the picture of God's care for "each one of these little ones"<br>
 <b><i>(\hen t&#333;n mikr&#333;n tout&#333;n\)</i></b> among God's children. The use of<br>
 \emprosthen\ with \thel&#275;ma\ is a Hebraism like \emprosthen sou\<br>
 in <!-#-->11:25 with \eudokia\, "before the face" of God.<br>
 <br>
 18:15 <B>{If thy brother sin against thee}</B> <b><i>(\ean hamart&#275;s&#275;i adelphos<br>
 sou\)</i></b>. Literally, commit a sin <b><i>(ingressive aorist subjunctive of<br>
 \hamartan&#333;\)</i></b>. Aleph B Sahidic do not have "against thee" <b><i>(\eis<br>
 se\)</i></b>. <B>{Shew him his fault}</B> <b><i>(\elegxon\)</i></b>. Such private reproof is<br>
 hard to do, but it is the way of Christ. <B>{Thou hast gained}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ekerd&#275;sas\)</i></b>. Aorist active indicative of \kerdain&#333;\ in<br>
 conclusion of a third-class condition, a sort of timeless aorist,<br>
 a blessed achievement already made.<br>
 <br>
 18:16 <B>{Take with thee}</B> <b><i>(\paralabe meta sou\)</i></b>. Take alone <b><i>(\para\)</i></b><br>
 with <b><i>(\meta\)</i></b> thee.<br>
 <br>
 18:17 <B>{Refuse to hear}</B> <b><i>(\parakous&#275;i\)</i></b>. Like <!-#-->Isa 65:12. Many<br>
 papyri examples for ignoring, disregarding, hearing without<br>
 heeding, hearing aside <b><i>(\para-\)</i></b>, hearing amiss, overhearing <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 5:36)</i></b>. <B>{The church}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i ekkl&#275;si&#257;i\)</i></b>. The local body, not the<br>
 general as in <!-#-->Mt 16:18 which see for discussion. The problem<br>
 here is whether Jesus has in mind an actual body of believers<br>
 already in existence or is speaking prophetically of the local<br>
 churches that would be organized later <b><i>(as in Acts)</i></b>. There are<br>
 some who think that the Twelve Apostles constituted a local<br>
 \ekkl&#275;sia\, a sort of moving church of preachers. That could only<br>
 be true in essence as they were a band of ministers and not<br>
 located in any one place. Bruce holds that they were "the<br>
 nucleus" of a local church at any rate.<br>
 <br>
 18:18 <B>{Shall be bound in heaven}</B> <b><i>(\estai dedemena en ouran&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Future passive periphrastic perfect indicative as in "shall be<br>
 loosed" <b><i>(\estai lelumena\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->16:19 this same unusual form<br>
 occurs. The binding and the loosing is there addressed to Peter,<br>
 but it is here repeated for the church or for the disciples as<br>
 the case may be.<br>
 <br>
 18:19 <B>{Shall agree}</B> <b><i>(\sumph&#333;n&#275;s&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Our word "symphony" is<br>
 this very root. It is no longer looked at as a concord of voices,<br>
 a chorus in harmony, though that would be very appropriate in a<br>
 church meeting rather than the rasping discord sometimes heard<br>
 even between two brethren or sisters. <B>{Of my Father}</B> <b><i>(\para tou<br>
 patros mou\)</i></b>. From the side of, "by my Father."<br>
 <br>
 18:20 <B>{There am I}</B> <b><i>(\ekei eimi\)</i></b>. This blessed promise implies<br>
 that those gathered together are really disciples with the spirit<br>
 of Christ as well as "in his name" <b><i>(\eis to emon onoma\)</i></b>. One of<br>
 the Oxyrhynchus _Sayings of Our Lord_ is: "Wherever there are<br>
 <b><i>(two)</i></b> they are not without God, and wherever there is one alone I<br>
 say I am with him." Also this: "Raise the stone and there thou<br>
 shalt find me, cleave the wood and there am I." See <!-#-->Mal 3:16.<br>
 <br>
 18:21 <B>{Until seven times?}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s heptakis?\)</i></b> Peter thought that<br>
 he was generous as the Jewish rule was three times <b><i>(<!-#-->Am 1:6)</i></b>.<br>
 His question goes back to verse <!-#-->15. "Against me" is genuine<br>
 here. "The man who asks such a question does not really know what<br>
 forgiveness means" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:22 <B>{Until seventy times seven}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s hebdom&#275;kontakis hepta\)</i></b>.<br>
 It is not clear whether this idiom means seventy-seven or as the<br>
 Revised Version has it <b><i>(490 times)</i></b>. If \heptakis\ were written it<br>
 would clearly be 490 times. The same ambiguity is seen in <!-#-->Ge<br>
 4:24, the LXX text by omitting \kai\. In the _Test. of the<br>
 Twelve Patriarchs, Benj._ vii. 4, it is used in the sense of<br>
 seventy times seven. But it really makes little difference<br>
 because Jesus clearly means unlimited forgiveness in either case.<br>
 "The unlimited revenge of primitive man has given place to the<br>
 unlimited forgiveness of Christians" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:23 <B>{Make a reckoning}</B> <b><i>(\sun&#257;rai logon\)</i></b>. Seen also in <!-#-->25:19.<br>
 Perhaps a Latinism, _rationes conferre_. First aorist active<br>
 infinitive of \sunair&#333;\, to cast up accounts, to settle, to<br>
 compare accounts with. Not in ancient Greek writers, but in two<br>
 papyri of the second century A.D. in the very sense here and the<br>
 substantive appears in an ostracon from Nubia of the early third<br>
 century <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient East_, p. 117)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:24 <B>{Ten thousand talents}</B> <b><i>(\muri&#333;n talant&#333;n\)</i></b>. A talent was<br>
 6,000 denarii or about a thousand dollars or 240 pounds. Ten<br>
 thousand times this is about ten or twelve million dollars, an<br>
 enormous sum for that period. We live today in the age of<br>
 national debts of billions of dollars or even of pounds sterling.<br>
 The imperial taxes of Judea, Idumea, and Samaria for one year<br>
 were only 600 talents while Galilee and Perea paid 200 <b><i>(Josephus,<br>
 _Ant_. xi. 4)</i></b>. But oriental kings were free in the use of money<br>
 and in making debts like the native kings of India today.<br>
 <br>
 18:25 <B>{Had not wherewith to pay}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; echontos autou apodounai\)</i></b>.<br>
 There is no "wherewith" in the Greek. This idiom is seen in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 7:42; 14:14; Heb 6:13. Genitive absolute though \auton\ in the<br>
 same clause as often in the N.T. <B>{To be sold}</B> <b><i>(\prath&#275;nai\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive infinitive of \piprask&#333;\. This was according<br>
 to the law <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 22:3; Le 25:39,47)</i></b>. Wife and children were<br>
 treated as property in those primitive times.<br>
 <br>
 18:27 <B>{The debt}</B> <b><i>(\to danion\)</i></b>. The loan. Common in the papyri<br>
 for a loan. The interest had increased the debt enormously. "This<br>
 heavy oriental usury is of the scenery of the parable" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:28 <B>{A hundred pence}</B> <b><i>(\hekaton d&#275;naria\)</i></b>. A denarius was worth<br>
 about eight and a half pence. The hundred denarii here were equal<br>
 to some "fifty shillings" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>, "about 4 pounds" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>,<br>
 "twenty pounds" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>, "twenty dollars" <b><i>(Goodspeed)</i></b>, "100<br>
 shillings" <b><i>(Weymouth)</i></b> . These are various efforts to represent in<br>
 modern language the small amount of this debt compared with the<br>
 big one. <B>{Took him by the throat}</B> <b><i>(\epnigen\)</i></b>. "Held him by the<br>
 throat" <b><i>(Allen)</i></b>. It is imperfect, probably inchoative, "began to<br>
 choke or throttle him." The Roman law allowed this indignity.<br>
 Vincent quotes Livy <b><i>(iv. 53)</i></b> who tells how the necks were twisted<br>
 <b><i>(_collum torsisset_)</i></b> and how Cicero <b><i>(_Pro Cluentio_, xxi.)</i></b> says:<br>
 "Lead him to the judgment seat with twisted neck <b><i>(_collo<br>
 obtorto_)</i></b>." <B>{What thou owest}</B> <b><i>(\ei ti opheileis\)</i></b>. Literally, "if<br>
 thou owest anything," however little. He did not even know how<br>
 much it was, only that he owed him something. "The 'if' is simply<br>
 the expression of a pitiless logic" <b><i>(Meyer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:30 <B>{And he would not}</B> <b><i>(\ho de ouk &#275;thelen\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense<br>
 of persistent refusal. <B>{Till he should pay}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s apod&#333;i\)</i></b>. This<br>
 futuristic aorist subjunctive is the rule with \he&#333;s\ for a<br>
 future goal. He was to stay in prison till he should pay. "He<br>
 acts on the instinct of a base nature, and also doubtless in<br>
 accordance with long habits of harsh tyrannical behaviour towards<br>
 men in his power" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. On imprisonment for debt among the<br>
 Greeks and Romans see Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient East_,<br>
 pp. 270,330.<br>
 <br>
 18:31 <B>{Told}</B> <b><i>(\diesaph&#275;san\)</i></b>. Made wholly clear to their own<br>
 lord. That is the usual result in the long run. There is a limit<br>
 to what people will put up with.<br>
 <br>
 18:33 <B>{Shouldst thou not?}</B> <b><i>(\ouk edei se?\)</i></b> "Was it not<br>
 necessary?" The king fits the cap on this wicked slave that he<br>
 put on the poor debtor.<br>
 <br>
 18:34 <B>{The tormentors}</B> <b><i>(\tois basanistais\)</i></b>. Not to prison<br>
 simply, but to terrible punishment. The papyri give various<br>
 instances of the verb \basaniz&#333;\, to torture, used of slaves and<br>
 others. "Livy <b><i>(ii. 23)</i></b> pictures an old centurion complaining that<br>
 he was taken by his creditor, not into servitude, but to a<br>
 workhouse and torture, and showing his back scarred with fresh<br>
 wounds" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. <B>{Till he should pay all}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s [hou] apod&#333;i<br>
 pan\)</i></b>. Just as in verse <!-#-->30, his very words. But this is not<br>
 purgatorial, but punitive, for he could never pay back that vast<br>
 debt.<br>
 <br>
 18:35 <B>{From your hearts}</B> <b><i>(\apo t&#333;n kardi&#333;n h&#8211;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. No sham or<br>
 lip pardon, and as often as needed. This is Christ's full reply<br>
 to Peter's question in <!-#-->18:21. This parable of the unmerciful<br>
 servant is surely needed today.<br>
