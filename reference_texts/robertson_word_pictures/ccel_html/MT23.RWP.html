<p>23:2 <B>{Sit on Moses' seat}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;s M&#333;use&#333;s kathedras<br>
 ekathisan\)</i></b>. The gnomic or timeless aorist tense, \ekathisan\,<br>
 not the aorist "for" the perfect. The "seat of Moses" is a brief<br>
 form for the chair of the professor whose function it is to<br>
 interpret Moses. "The heirs of Moses' authority by an unbroken<br>
 tradition can deliver _ex cathedra_ pronouncements on his<br>
 teaching" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 23:3 <B>{For they say and do not}</B> <b><i>(\legousin kai ou poiousin\)</i></b>. "As<br>
 teachers they have their place, but beware of following their<br>
 example" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. So Jesus said: "Do not ye after their works "<br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275; poieite\)</i></b>. Do not practice their practices. They are only<br>
 preachers. Jesus does not here disapprove any of their teachings<br>
 as he does elsewhere. The point made here is that they are only<br>
 teachers <b><i>(or preachers)</i></b> and do not practice what they teach as<br>
 God sees it.<br>
 <br>
 23:4 <B>{With their finger}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i daktul&#333;i aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. A picturesque<br>
 proverb. They are taskmasters, not burden-bearers, not<br>
 sympathetic helpers.<br>
 <br>
 23:5 <B>{To be seen of men}</B> <b><i>(\pros to theath&#275;nai tois anthr&#333;pois\)</i></b>.<br>
 See <!-#-->6:1 where this same idiom occurs. Ostentation regulates the<br>
 conduct of the rabbis. <B>{Phylacteries}</B> <b><i>(\phulakt&#275;ria\)</i></b>. An<br>
 adjective from \phulakt&#275;r, phulass&#333;\ <b><i>(to guard)</i></b>. So a fortified<br>
 place, station for garrison, then a safeguard, protecting charm<br>
 or amulet. The rabbis wore \tephillin\ or prayer-fillets, small<br>
 leather cases with four strips of parchment on which were written<br>
 the words of <!-#-->Ex 13:1-10,11-16; De 6:4-9; 11:13-21. They took<br>
 literally the words about "a sign unto thy hand," "a memorial<br>
 between thine eyes," and "frontlets." "That for the head was to<br>
 consist of a box with four compartments, each containing a slip<br>
 of parchment inscribed with one of the four passages. Each of<br>
 these strips was to be tied up with a well-washed hair from a<br>
 calf's tail; lest, if tied with wool or thread, any fungoid<br>
 growth should ever pollute them. The phylactery of the arm was to<br>
 contain a single slip, with the same four passages written in<br>
 four columns of seven lines each. The black leather straps by<br>
 which they were fastened were wound seven times round the arm and<br>
 three times round the hand. They were reverenced by the rabbis as<br>
 highly as the scriptures, and, like them, might be rescued from<br>
 the flames on a sabbath. They profanely imagined that God wore<br>
 the _tephillin_" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. It is small wonder that Jesus<br>
 ridiculed such minute concern for pretentious externalism and<br>
 literalism. These _tephillin_ "are still worn at the present day<br>
 on the forehead and left arm by Jews at the daily Morning Prayer"<br>
 <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b> . "The size of the phylacteries indexed the measure of<br>
 zeal, and the wearing of large ones was apt to take the place of<br>
 obedience" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Hence they made them "broad." The<br>
 superstitious would wear them as mere charms to ward off evil.<br>
 <B>{Enlarge the borders}</B> <b><i>(\megalunousin ta kraspeda\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->9:20 we<br>
 see that Jesus, like the Jews generally, wore a tassel or tuft,<br>
 hem or border, a fringe on the outer garment according to <!-#-->Nu<br>
 15:38. Here again the Jewish rabbi had minute rules about the<br>
 number of the fringes and the knots <b><i>(see on &#175;9:20)</i></b>. They made a<br>
 virtue of the size of the fringes also. "Such things were useful<br>
 as reminders; they were fatal when they were regarded as charms"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 23:6 <B>{The chief place at feasts}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n pr&#333;toklisian en tois<br>
 deipnois\)</i></b>. Literally, the first reclining place on the divan at<br>
 the meal. The Persians, Greeks, Romans, Jews differed in their<br>
 customs, but all cared for the post of honour at formal functions<br>
 as is true of us today. Hostesses often solve the point by<br>
 putting the name of each guest at the table. At the last passover<br>
 meal the apostles had an ugly snarl over this very point of<br>
 precedence <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:24; Joh 13:2-11)</i></b>, just two days after this<br>
 exposure of the Pharisees in the presence of the apostles. <B>{The<br>
 chief seats in the synagogues}</B> <b><i>(\tas pr&#333;tokathedrias en tais<br>
 sunag&#333;gais\)</i></b>. "An insatiable hunger for prominence" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 These chief seats <b><i>(Zuchermandel)</i></b> were on the platform looking to<br>
 the audience and with the back to the chest in which were kept<br>
 the rolls of scripture. The Essenes had a different arrangement.<br>
 People today pay high prices for front seats at the theatre, but<br>
 at church prefer the rear seats out of a curious mock-humility.<br>
 In the time of Jesus the hypocrites boldly sat up in front. Now,<br>
 if they come to church at all, they take the rear seats.<br>
 <br>
 23:7 <B>{Salutations}</B> <b><i>(\aspasmous\)</i></b>. The ordinary courtiers were<br>
 coveted because in public. They had an itch for notice. There are<br>
 occasionally today ministers who resent it if they are not called<br>
 upon to take part in the services at church. They feel that their<br>
 ministerial dignity has not been recognized.<br>
 <br>
 23:8 <B>{But be not ye called Rabbi}</B> <b><i>(\humeis de m&#275; kl&#275;th&#275;te<br>
 Rabbei\)</i></b>. An apparent aside to the disciples. Note the emphatic<br>
 position of \humeis\. Some even regard verses <!-#-->8-10 as a later<br>
 addition and not part of this address to the Pharisees, but the<br>
 apostles were present. Euthymius Zigabenus says: "Do not seek to<br>
 be called <b><i>(ingressive aorist subjunctive)</i></b>, if others call you<br>
 this it will not be your fault." This is not far from the<br>
 Master's meaning. Rabbi means "my great one," "my Master,"<br>
 apparently a comparatively new title in Christ's time.<br>
 <br>
 23:9 <B>{Call no man your father}</B> <b><i>(\patera m&#275; kales&#275;te h&#8211;m&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Jesus meant the full sense of this noble word for our heavenly<br>
 Father. "Abba was not commonly a mode of address to a living<br>
 person, but a title of honour for Rabbis and great men of the<br>
 past" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. In Gethsemane Jesus said: "Abba, Father" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 14:36)</i></b>. Certainly the ascription of "Father" to pope and priest<br>
 seems out of harmony with what Jesus here says. He should not be<br>
 understood to be condemning the title to one's real earthly<br>
 father. Jesus often leaves the exceptions to be supplied.<br>
 <br>
 23:10 <B>{Masters}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#275;g&#275;tai\)</i></b>. This word occurs here only in the<br>
 N.T. It is found in the papyri for teacher <b><i>(Latin, _doctor_)</i></b>. It<br>
 is the modern Greek word for professor. "While \didaskalos\<br>
 represents \Rab\, \kath&#275;g&#275;tes\ stands for the more honourable<br>
 \Rabban, -b&#333;n\" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. Dalman <b><i>(_Words of Jesus_, p. 340)</i></b><br>
 suggests that the same Aramaic word may be translated by either<br>
 \didaskalos\ or \kath&#275;g&#275;tes\. <B>{The Christ}</B> <b><i>(\ho Christos\)</i></b>. The<br>
 use of these words here by Jesus like "Jesus Christ" in his<br>
 Prayer <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 17:3)</i></b> is held by some to show that they were added<br>
 by the evangelist to what Jesus actually said, since the Master<br>
 would not have so described himself. But he commended Peter for<br>
 calling him "the Christ the Son of the living God" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 16:16f.)</i></b>. We must not empty the consciousness of Jesus too much.<br>
 <br>
 23:12 <B>{Exalt himself}</B> <b><i>(\hups&#333;sei heauton\)</i></b>. Somewhat like <!-#-->18:4;<br>
 20:26. Given by Luke in other contexts <b><i>(<!-#-->14:11; 18:14)</i></b>.<br>
 Characteristic of Christ.<br>
 <br>
 23:13 <B>{Hypocrites}</B> <b><i>(\hupokritai\)</i></b>. This terrible word of Jesus<br>
 appears first from him in the Sermon on the Mount <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 6:2,5,16;<br>
 7:5)</i></b>, then in <!-#-->15:7 and <!-#-->22:18. Here it appears "with terrific<br>
 iteration" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b> save in the third of the seven woes<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->23:13,15,23,25,27,29)</i></b>. The verb in the active <b><i>(\hupokrin&#333;\)</i></b><br>
 meant to separate slowly or slightly subject to gradual inquiry.<br>
 Then the middle was to make answer, to take up a part on the<br>
 stage, to act a part. It was an easy step to mean to feign, to<br>
 pretend, to wear a masque, to act the hypocrite, to play a part.<br>
 This hardest word from the lips of Jesus falls on those who were<br>
 the religious leaders of the Jews <b><i>(Scribes and Pharisees)</i></b>, who<br>
 had justified this thunderbolt of wrath by their conduct toward<br>
 Jesus and their treatment of things high and holy. The _Textus<br>
 Receptus has eight woes, adding verse <!-#-->14 which the Revised<br>
 Version places in the margin <b><i>(called verse <!-#-->13 by Westcott and<br>
 Hort and rejected on the authority of Aleph B D as a manifest<br>
 gloss from <!-#-->Mr 12:40 and <!-#-->Lu 20:47)</i></b>. The MSS. that insert it<br>
 put it either before 13 or after 13. Plummer cites these seven<br>
 woes as another example of Matthew's fondness for the number<br>
 seven, more fancy than fact for Matthew's Gospel is not the<br>
 Apocalypse of John. These are all illustrations of Pharisaic<br>
 saying and not doing <b><i>(Allen)</i></b>. <B>{Ye shut the kingdom of heaven}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kleiete t&#275;n basileian t&#333;n ouran&#333;n\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Lu 11:52 the lawyers<br>
 are accused of keeping the door to the house of knowledge locked<br>
 and with flinging away the keys so as to keep themselves and the<br>
 people in ignorance. These custodians of the kingdom by their<br>
 teaching obscured the way to life. It is a tragedy to think how<br>
 preachers and teachers of the kingdom of God may block the door<br>
 for those who try to enter in <b><i>(\tous eiserchomenous\, conative<br>
 present middle participle)</i></b>. <B>{Against}</B> <b><i>(\emprosthen\)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 before. These door-keepers of the kingdom slam it shut in men's<br>
 faces and they themselves are on the outside where they will<br>
 remain. They hide the key to keep others from going in.<br>
 <br>
 23:15 <B>{Twofold more a son of hell than yourselves}</B> <b><i>(\huion<br>
 geenn&#275;s diploteron h&#8211;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. It is a convert to Pharisaism rather<br>
 than Judaism that is meant by "one proselyte" <b><i>(\hena<br>
 pros&#275;luton\)</i></b>, from \proserchomai\, newcomers, aliens. There were<br>
 two kinds of proselytes: of the gate <b><i>(not actual Jews, but<br>
 God-fearers and well-wishers of Judaism, like Cornelius)</i></b>, of<br>
 righteousness who received circumcision and became actual Jews.<br>
 But a very small per cent of the latter became Pharisees. There<br>
 was a Hellenistic Jewish literature <b><i>(Philo, Sibylline Oracles,<br>
 etc.)</i></b> designed to attract Gentiles to Judaism. But the Pharisaic<br>
 missionary zeal <b><i>(compass, \periag&#275;te\, go around)</i></b> was a<br>
 comparative failure. And success was even worse, Jesus says with<br>
 pitiless plainness. The "son of Gehenna" means one fitted for and<br>
 so destined for Gehenna. "The more converted the more perverted"<br>
 <b><i>(H.J. Holtzmann)</i></b>. The Pharisees claimed to be in a special sense<br>
 sons of the kingdom <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 8:12)</i></b>. They were more partisan than<br>
 pious. \Diplous\ <b><i>(twofold, double)</i></b> is common in the papyri. The<br>
 comparative here used, as if from \diplos\, appears also in<br>
 Appian. Note the ablative of comparison h&#8211;m&#333;n. It was a withering<br>
 thrust.<br>
 <br>
 23:16 <B>{Ye blind guides}</B> <b><i>(\hod&#275;goi tuphloi\)</i></b>. Note omission of<br>
 "Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites" with this third woe. In<br>
 <!-#-->15:14 Jesus had already called the Pharisees "blind guides"<br>
 <b><i>(leaders)</i></b>. They split hairs about oaths, as Jesus had explained<br>
 in <!-#-->5:33-37, between the temple and the gold of the temple. <B>{He<br>
 is a debtor}</B> <b><i>(\opheilei\)</i></b>. He owes his oath, is bound by his<br>
 oath. A.V., <B>{is guilty}</B>, is old English, obsolete sense of guilt<br>
 as fine or payment.<br>
 <br>
 23:17 <B>{Ye fools}</B> <b><i>(\m&#333;roi\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->5:22 Jesus had warned against<br>
 calling a man \m&#333;ros\ in a rage, but here he so terms the blind<br>
 Pharisees for their stupidity, description of the class. "It<br>
 shows that not the word but the spirit in which it is uttered is<br>
 what matters" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 23:23 <B>{Ye tithe}</B> <b><i>(\apodekatoute\)</i></b>. The tithe had to be paid upon<br>
 "all the increase of thy seed" <b><i>(<!-#-->De 14:22; Le 27:30)</i></b>. The<br>
 English word tithe is tenth. These small aromatic herbs, mint<br>
 <b><i>(\to h&#275;duosmon\, sweet-smelling)</i></b>, anise or dill <b><i>(\an&#275;thon\)</i></b>,<br>
 cummin <b><i>(\kuminon\, with aromatic seeds)</i></b>, show the Pharisaic<br>
 scrupulous conscientiousness, all marketable commodities. "The<br>
 Talmud tells of the ass of a certain Rabbi which had been so well<br>
 trained as to refuse corn of which the tithes had not been taken"<br>
 <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. <B>{These ye ought}</B> <b><i>(\tauta edei\)</i></b>. Jesus does not<br>
 condemn tithing. What he does condemn is doing it to the neglect<br>
 of the <B>{weightier matters}</B> <b><i>(\ta barutera\)</i></b>. The Pharisees were<br>
 externalists; cf. <!-#-->Lu 11:39-44.<br>
 <br>
 23:24 <B>{Strain out the gnat}</B> <b><i>(\diulizontes ton k&#333;n&#333;pa\)</i></b>. By<br>
 filtering through <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b>, not the "straining at" in swallowing<br>
 so crudely suggested by the misprint in the A.V. <B>{Swallow the<br>
 camel}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n de kam&#275;lon katapinontes\)</i></b>. Gulping or drinking down<br>
 the camel. An oriental hyperbole like that in <!-#-->19:24. See also<br>
 <!-#-->5:29,30; 17:20; 21:21. Both insects and camels were<br>
 ceremonially unclean <b><i>(<!-#-->Le 11:4,20,23,42)</i></b>. "He that kills a flea<br>
 on the Sabbath is as guilty as if he killed a camel" <b><i>(Jer.<br>
 _Shabb._ 107)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 23:25 <B>{From extortion and excess}</B> <b><i>(\ex harpag&#275;s kai akrasias\)</i></b>. A<br>
 much more serious accusation. These punctilious observers of the<br>
 external ceremonies did not hesitate at robbery <b><i>(\harpages\)</i></b> and<br>
 graft <b><i>(\akrasias\)</i></b>, lack of control. A modern picture of<br>
 wickedness in high places both civil and ecclesiastical where the<br>
 moral elements in life are ruthlessly trodden under foot. Of<br>
 course, the idea is for both the outside \ektos\ and the inside<br>
 <b><i>(\entos\)</i></b> of the cup and the platter <b><i>(fine side dish)</i></b>. But the<br>
 inside is the more important. Note the change to singular in<br>
 verse <!-#-->26 as if Jesus in a friendlier tone pleads with a<br>
 Pharisee to mend his ways.<br>
 <br>
 23:27 <B>{Whited sepulchre}</B> <b><i>(\taphois kekoniamenois\)</i></b>. The perfect<br>
 passive participle is from \konia&#333;\ and that from \konia\, dust<br>
 or lime. Whitened with powdered lime dust, the sepulchres of the<br>
 poor in the fields or the roadside. Not the rock-hewn tombs of<br>
 the well-to-do. These were whitewashed a month before the<br>
 passover that travellers might see them and so avoid being<br>
 defiled by touching them <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 19:16)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Ac 23:3 Paul called<br>
 the high priest a whited wall. When Jesus spoke the sepulchres<br>
 had been freshly whitewashed. We today speak of whitewashing<br>
 moral evil.<br>
 <br>
 23:29 <B>{The tombs of the prophets}</B> <b><i>(\tous taphous t&#333;n proph&#275;t&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Cf. <!-#-->Lu 11:48-52. They were bearing witness against themselves<br>
 <b><i>(\heautois\, verse <!-#-->31)</i></b> to "the murder-taint in your blood"<br>
 <b><i>(Allen)</i></b>. "These men who professed to be so distressed at the<br>
 murdering of the Prophets, were themselves compassing the death<br>
 of Him who was far greater than any Prophet" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. There are<br>
 four monuments called Tombs of the Prophets <b><i>(Zechariah, Absalom,<br>
 Jehoshaphat, St. James)</i></b> at the base of the Mount of Olives. Some<br>
 of these may have been going up at the very time that Jesus<br>
 spoke. In this seventh and last woe Jesus addresses the Jewish<br>
 nation and not merely the Pharisees.<br>
 <br>
 23:32 <B>{Fill ye up}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;r&#333;sate\)</i></b>. The keenest irony in this<br>
 command has been softened in some MSS. to the future indicative<br>
 <b><i>(\pl&#275;r&#333;sete\)</i></b>. "Fill up the measure of your fathers; crown their<br>
 misdeeds by killing the prophet God has sent to you. Do at last<br>
 what has long been in your hearts. The hour is come" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 23:33 <B>{Ye serpents, ye offspring of vipers}</B> <b><i>(\opheis genn&#275;mata<br>
 echidn&#333;n\)</i></b>. These blistering words come as a climax and remind<br>
 one of the Baptist <b><i>(<!-#-->3:17)</i></b> and of the time when the Pharisees<br>
 accused Jesus of being in league with Beelzebub <b><i>(<!-#-->12:34)</i></b>. They<br>
 cut to the bone like whip-cords. <B>{How shall ye escape}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;s<br>
 phug&#275;te\)</i></b>. Deliberate subjunctive. There is a curse in the Talmud<br>
 somewhat like this: "Woe to the house of Annas! Woe to their<br>
 serpent-like hissings."<br>
 <br>
 23:35 <B>{Zachariah son of Barachiah}</B> <b><i>(\Zachariou huiou Barachiou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Broadus gives well the various alternatives in understanding and<br>
 explaining the presence of "son of Barachiah" here which is not<br>
 in <!-#-->Lu 11:51. The usual explanation is that the reference is to<br>
 Zachariah the son of Jehoiada the priest who was slain in the<br>
 court of the temple <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ch 24:20ff.)</i></b>. How the words, "son of<br>
 Barachiah," got into Matthew we do not know. A half-dozen<br>
 possibilities can be suggested. In the case of Abel a reckoning<br>
 for the shedding of his blood was foretold <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 4:10)</i></b> and the<br>
 same thing was true of the slaying of Zachariah <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ch 24:22)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 23:37 <B>{How often would I have gathered}</B> <b><i>(\posakis &#275;thel&#275;sa<br>
 episunagein\)</i></b>. More exactly, how often did I long to gather to<br>
 myself <b><i>(double compound infinitive)</i></b>. The same verb <b><i>(\episunagei\)</i></b><br>
 is used of the hen with the compound preposition \hupokat&#333;\.<br>
 Everyone has seen the hen quickly get together the chicks under<br>
 her wings in the time of danger. These words naturally suggest<br>
 previous visits to Jerusalem made plain by John's Gospel.<br>
