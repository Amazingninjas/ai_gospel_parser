<p>15:1 <B>{From Jerusalem}</B> <b><i>(\apo Ierosolum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Jerusalem is the<br>
 headquarters of the conspiracy against Jesus with the Pharisees<br>
 as the leaders in it. Already we have seen the Herodians<br>
 combining with the Pharisees in the purpose to put Jesus to death<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 3:6; Mt 12:14; Lu 6:11)</i></b>. Soon Jesus will warn the disciples<br>
 against the Sadducees also <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 16:6)</i></b>. Unusual order here,<br>
 "Pharisees and scribes." "The guardians of tradition in the<br>
 capital have their evil eye on Jesus and co-operate with the<br>
 provincial rigorists" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>, if the Pharisees were not all from<br>
 Jerusalem.<br>
 <br>
 15:2 <B>{The tradition of the elders}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n paradosin t&#333;n<br>
 presbuter&#333;n\)</i></b>. This was the oral law, handed down by the elders<br>
 of the past in _ex cathedra_ fashion and later codified in the<br>
 Mishna. Handwashing before meals is not a requirement of the Old<br>
 Testament. It is, we know, a good thing for sanitary reasons, but<br>
 the rabbis made it a mark of righteousness for others at any<br>
 rate. This item was magnified at great length in the oral<br>
 teaching. The washing <b><i>(\niptontai\, middle voice, note)</i></b> of the<br>
 hands called for minute regulations. It was commanded to wash the<br>
 hands before meals, it was one's duty to do it after eating. The<br>
 more rigorous did it between the courses. The hands must be<br>
 immersed. Then the water itself must be "clean" and the cups or<br>
 pots used must be ceremonially "clean." Vessels were kept full of<br>
 clean water ready for use <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 2:6-8)</i></b>. So it went on _ad<br>
 infinitum_. Thus a real issue is raised between Jesus and the<br>
 rabbis. It was far more than a point of etiquette or of<br>
 hygienics. The rabbis held it to be a mortal sin. The incident<br>
 may have happened in a Pharisee's house.<br>
 <br>
 15:3 <B>{Ye also}</B> <b><i>(\kai h&#8211;meis\)</i></b>. Jesus admits that the disciples<br>
 had transgressed the rabbinical traditions. Jesus treats it as a<br>
 matter of no great importance in itself save as they had put the<br>
 tradition of the elders in the place of the commandment of God.<br>
 When the two clashed, as was often the case, the rabbis<br>
 transgress the commandment of God "because of your tradition"<br>
 <b><i>(\dia t&#275;n paradosin h&#8211;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. The accusative with \dia\ means<br>
 that, not "by means of." Tradition is not good or bad in itself.<br>
 It is merely what is handed on from one to another. Custom tended<br>
 to make these traditions binding like law. The Talmud is a<br>
 monument of their struggle with tradition. There could be no<br>
 compromise on this subject and Jesus accepts the issue. He stands<br>
 for real righteousness and spiritual freedom, not for bondage to<br>
 mere ceremonialism and tradition. The rabbis placed tradition<br>
 <b><i>(the oral law)</i></b> above the law of God.<br>
 <br>
 15:5 <B>{But ye say}</B> <b><i>(\h&#8211;meis de legete\)</i></b>. In sharp contrast to the<br>
 command of God. Jesus had quoted the fifth commandment <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex<br>
 20:12,16)</i></b> with the penalty "die the death" <b><i>(\thanat&#333;i<br>
 teleutat&#333;\)</i></b>, "go on to his end by death," in imitation of the<br>
 Hebrew idiom. They dodged this command of God about the penalty<br>
 for dishonouring one's father or mother by the use "Corban"<br>
 <b><i>(\korban\)</i></b> as Mark calls it <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 7:11)</i></b>. All one had to do to<br>
 evade one's duty to father or mother was to say "Corban" or<br>
 "Gift" <b><i>(\D&#333;ron\)</i></b> with the idea of using the money for God. By an<br>
 angry oath of refusal to help one's parents, the oath or vow was<br>
 binding. By this magic word one set himself free <b><i>(\ou m&#275;<br>
 tim&#275;sei\, he shall not honour)</i></b> from obedience to the fifth<br>
 commandment. Sometimes unfilial sons paid graft to the rabbinical<br>
 legalists for such dodges. Were some of these very faultfinders<br>
 guilty?<br>
 <br>
 15:6 <B>{Ye have made void the word of God}</B> <b><i>(\ekur&#333;sate ton logon<br>
 tou theou\)</i></b>. It was a stinging indictment that laid bare the<br>
 hollow pretence of their quibbles about handwashing. \Kuros\<br>
 means force or authority, \akuros\ is without authority, null and<br>
 void. It is a late verb, \akuro&#333;\ but in the LXX, <!-#-->Gal 3:17; and<br>
 in the papyri Adjective, verb, and substantive occur in legal<br>
 phraseology like cancelling a will, etc. The moral force of God's<br>
 law is annulled by their hairsplitting technicalities and immoral<br>
 conduct.<br>
 <br>
 15:7 <B>{Well did Isaiah prophesy of you}</B> <b><i>(\kal&#333;s eproph&#275;teusen peri<br>
 h&#8211;m&#333;n Esaias\)</i></b>. There is sarcasm in this pointed application of<br>
 Isaiah's words <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 29:13)</i></b> to these rabbis. He "beautifully<br>
 pictured" them. The portrait was to the very life, "teaching as<br>
 their doctrines the commandments of men." They were indeed far<br>
 from God if they imagined that God would be pleased with such<br>
 gifts at the expense of duty to one's parents.<br>
 <br>
 15:11 <B>{This defileth the man}</B> <b><i>(\touto koinoi ton anthr&#333;pon\)</i></b>.<br>
 This word is from \koinos\ which is used in two senses, either<br>
 what is "common" to all and general like the _Koin&#275;_ Greek, or<br>
 what is unclean and "common" either ceremonially or in reality.<br>
 The ceremonial "commonness" disturbed Peter on the housetop in<br>
 Joppa <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10:14)</i></b>. See also <!-#-->Ac 21:28; Heb 9:13. One who is<br>
 thus religiously common or unclean is cut off from doing his<br>
 religious acts. "Defilement" was a grave issue with the<br>
 rabbinical ceremonialists. Jesus appeals to the crowd here: <B>{Hear<br>
 and understand}</B> <b><i>(\akouete kai suniete\)</i></b>. He has a profound<br>
 distinction to draw. Moral uncleanness is what makes a man<br>
 common, defiles him. That is what is to be dreaded, not to be<br>
 glossed over. "This goes beyond the tradition of the elders and<br>
 virtually abrogates the Levitical distinctions between clean and<br>
 unclean" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. One can see the pettifogging pretenders shrivel<br>
 up under these withering words.<br>
 <br>
 15:12 <B>{Were offended}</B> <b><i>(\eskandalisth&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist passive.<br>
 "Were caused to stumble," "have taken offence" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>, "have<br>
 turned against you" <b><i>(Weymouth)</i></b>, "were shocked" <b><i>(Goodspeed)</i></b>, "War<br>
 ill-pleased" <b><i>(Braid Scots)</i></b>. They took umbrage at the public<br>
 rebuke and at such a scorpion sting in it all. It cut to the<br>
 quick because it was true. It showed in the glowering<br>
 countenances of the Pharisees so plainly that the disciples were<br>
 uneasy. See on &#175;5:29.<br>
 <br>
 15:14 <B>{They are blind guides}</B> <b><i>(\tuphloi eisin hod&#275;goi\)</i></b>. Graphic<br>
 picture. Once in Cincinnati a blind man introduced me to his<br>
 blind friend. He said that he was showing him the city. Jesus is<br>
 not afraid of the Pharisees. Let them alone to do their worst.<br>
 Blind leaders and blind victims will land in the ditch. A<br>
 proverbial expression in the O.T.<br>
 <br>
 15:15 <B>{Declare unto us the parable}</B> <b><i>(\phrason h&#8211;min t&#275;n<br>
 parabol&#275;n\)</i></b>. Explain the parable <b><i>(pithy saying)</i></b> in verse <!-#-->11,<br>
 not in verse <!-#-->14. As a matter of fact, the disciples had been<br>
 upset by Christ's powerful exposure of the "Corban" duplicity and<br>
 the words about "defilement" in verse <!-#-->11.<br>
 <br>
 15:16 <B>{Are ye also even yet without understanding?}</B> <b><i>(\Akm&#275;n kai<br>
 h&#8211;meis asunetoi este\)</i></b>. \Akm&#275;n\ is an adverbial accusative<br>
 <b><i>(classic \aichm&#275;\, point <b><i>(of a weapon)</i></b>=\akm&#275;n chronou\)</i></b> at this<br>
 point of time, just now=\eti\. It occurs in papyri and<br>
 inscriptions, though condemned by the old grammarians. "In spite<br>
 of all my teaching, are ye also like the Pharisees without<br>
 spiritual insight and grasp?" One must never forget that the<br>
 disciples lived in a Pharisaic environment. Their religious<br>
 world-outlook was Pharisaic. They were lacking in spiritual<br>
 intelligence or sense, "totally ignorant" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:17 <B>{Perceive ye not?}</B> <b><i>(\ou noeite\)</i></b>. Christ expects us to make<br>
 use of our \nous\, intellect, not for pride, but for insight. The<br>
 mind does not work infallibly, but we should use it for its<br>
 God-given purpose. Intellectual laziness or flabbiness is no<br>
 credit to a devout soul.<br>
 <br>
 15:18 <B>{Out of the mouth}</B> <b><i>(\ek tou stomatos\)</i></b>. Spoken words come<br>
 out of the heart and so are a true index of character. By "heart"<br>
 <b><i>(\kardias\)</i></b> Jesus means not just the emotional nature, but the<br>
 entire man, the inward life of "evil thoughts" <b><i>(\dialogismoi<br>
 pon&#275;roi\)</i></b> that issue in words and deeds. "These defile the man,"<br>
 not "eating with unwashed hands." The captious quibblings of the<br>
 Pharisees, for instance, had come out of evil hearts.<br>
 <br>
 15:22 <B>{A Canaanitish woman}</B> <b><i>(\gun&#275; Chananaia\)</i></b>. The Phoenicians<br>
 were descended from the Canaanites, the original inhabitants of<br>
 Palestine. They were of Semitic race, therefore, though pagan.<br>
 <B>{Have pity on me}</B> <b><i>(\ele&#275;son me\)</i></b>. She made her daughter's case<br>
 her own, "badly demonized."<br>
 <br>
 15:23 <B>{For she crieth after us}</B> <b><i>(\hoti krazei opisthen h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 The disciples greatly disliked this form of public attention, a<br>
 strange woman crying after them. They disliked a sensation. Did<br>
 they wish the woman sent away with her daughter healed or<br>
 unhealed?<br>
 <br>
 15:24 <B>{I was not sent}</B> <b><i>(\ouk apestal&#275;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive<br>
 indicative of \apostell&#333;\. Jesus takes a new turn with this woman<br>
 in Phoenicia. He makes a test case of her request. In a way she<br>
 represented the problem of the Gentile world. He calls the Jews<br>
 "the lost sheep of the house of Israel" in spite of the conduct<br>
 of the Pharisees.<br>
 <br>
 15:27 <B>{Even the dogs}</B> <b><i>(\kai ta kunaria\)</i></b>. She took no offence at<br>
 the implication of being a Gentile dog. The rather she with quick<br>
 wit took Christ's very word for little dogs <b><i>(\kunaria\)</i></b> and<br>
 deftly turned it to her own advantage, for the little dogs eat of<br>
 the crumbs <b><i>(\psichi&#333;n\, little morsels, diminutive again)</i></b> that<br>
 fall from the table of their masters <b><i>(\kuri&#333;n\)</i></b>, the children.<br>
 <br>
 15:28 <B>{As thou wilt}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s theleis\)</i></b>. Her great faith and her<br>
 keen rejoinder won her case.<br>
 <br>
 15:29 <B>{And sat there}</B> <b><i>(\ekath&#275;to ekei\)</i></b>. "Was sitting there" on<br>
 the mountain side near the sea of Galilee, possibly to rest and<br>
 to enjoy the view or more likely to teach.<br>
 <br>
 15:30 <B>{And they cast them down at his feet}</B> <b><i>(\kai eripsan autous<br>
 para tous podas autou\)</i></b>. A very strong word, flung them down,<br>
 "not carelessly, but in haste, because so many were coming on the<br>
 same errand" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. It was a great day for "they glorified<br>
 the God of Israel."<br>
 <br>
 15:32 <B>{Three days}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;merai treis\)</i></b>. A parenthetic nominative<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 460)</i></b>. <B>{What to eat}</B> <b><i>(\ti phag&#333;sin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Indirect question with the deliberative subjunctive retained. In<br>
 the feeding of the five thousand Jesus took compassion on the<br>
 people and healed their sick <b><i>(<!-#-->14:14)</i></b>. Here the hunger of the<br>
 multitude moves him to compassion <b><i>(\splagchnizomai\, in both<br>
 instances)</i></b>. So he is unwilling <b><i>(\ou thel&#333;\)</i></b> to send them away<br>
 hungry. <B>{Faint}</B> <b><i>(\ekluth&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Unloosed, <b><i>(\eklu&#333;\)</i></b> exhausted.<br>
 <br>
 15:33 <B>{And the disciples say to him}</B> <b><i>(\kai legousin aut&#333;i hoi<br>
 math&#275;tai\)</i></b>. It seems strange that they should so soon have<br>
 forgotten the feeding of the five thousand <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 14:13-21)</i></b>, but<br>
 they did. Soon Jesus will remind them of both these<br>
 demonstrations of his power <b><i>(<!-#-->16:9,10)</i></b>. They forgot both of<br>
 them, not just one. Some scholars scout the idea of two miracles<br>
 so similar as the feeding of the five thousand and the four<br>
 thousand, though both are narrated in detail by both Mark and<br>
 Matthew and both are later mentioned by Jesus. Jesus repeated his<br>
 sayings and wrought multitudes of healings. There is no reason in<br>
 itself why Jesus should not on occasion repeat a nature miracle<br>
 like this elsewhere. He is in the region of Decapolis, not in the<br>
 country of Philip <b><i>(\Trachonitis\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:34 <B>{A few small fishes}</B> <b><i>(\oliga ichthudia\, diminutive again)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:35 <B>{On the ground}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;n g&#275;n\)</i></b>. No mention of "grass" as<br>
 in <!-#-->14:19 for this time, midsummer, the grass would be parched<br>
 and gone.<br>
 <br>
 15:36 <B>{Gave thanks}</B> <b><i>(\eucharist&#275;sas\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->14:19 the word used<br>
 for "grace" or "blessing" is \eulog&#275;sen\. Vincent notes that the<br>
 Jewish custom was for the head of the house to say the blessing<br>
 only if he shared the meal unless the guests were his own<br>
 household. But we need not think of Jesus as bound by the<br>
 peccadilloes of Jewish customs.<br>
 <br>
 15:39 <B>{The borders of Magadan}</B> <b><i>(\eis ta horia Magadan\)</i></b>. On the<br>
 eastern side of the Sea of Galilee and so in Galilee again. Mark<br>
 terms it Dalmanutha <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 8:10)</i></b>. Perhaps after all the same place<br>
 as Magdala, as most manuscripts have it.<br>
