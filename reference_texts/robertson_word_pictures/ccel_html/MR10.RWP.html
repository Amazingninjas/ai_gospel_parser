<p>10:1 <B>{Into the border of Judea and beyond Jordan}</B> <b><i>(\eis ta horia<br>
 t&#275;s Ioudaias kai peran tou Iordanou\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 19:1 for<br>
 discussion of this curious expression. Matthew adds "from<br>
 Galilee" and <!-#-->Lu 17:11 says that Jesus "was passing through the<br>
 midst of Samaria and Galilee" after leaving Ephraim <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 11:54)</i></b>. A great deal has intervened between the events at the<br>
 close of Mark 9 and those in the beginning of Mark 10. For these<br>
 events see <!-#-->Mt 18; Joh 7-11; Lu 9:57-18:14 <b><i>(one-third of Luke's<br>
 Gospel comes in here)</i></b>. It was a little over six months to the end<br>
 at the close of Mark 9. It is just a few weeks now in Mark 10.<br>
 Jesus has begun his last journey to Jerusalem going north through<br>
 Samaria, Galilee, across the Jordan into Perea, and back into<br>
 Judea near Jericho to go up with the passover pilgrims from<br>
 Galilee. <B>{Multitudes}</B> <b><i>(\ochloi\)</i></b>. Caravans and caravans<br>
 journeying to Jerusalem. Many of them are followers of Jesus from<br>
 Galilee or at least kindly disposed towards him. They go together<br>
 <b><i>(\sunporeuontai\)</i></b> with Jesus. Note dramatic historical present.<br>
 <B>{As he was wont}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s ei&#333;thei\)</i></b>. Second past perfect used like<br>
 an imperfect from \ei&#333;tha\, second perfect active. Jesus <B>{was<br>
 teaching}</B> <b><i>(\edidasken\, imperfect, no longer present tense)</i></b> this<br>
 moving caravan.<br>
 <br>
 10:2 <B>{Tempting him}</B> <b><i>(\peirazontes\)</i></b>. As soon as Jesus appears in<br>
 Galilee the Pharisees attack him again <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->7:5; 8:11)</i></b>. Gould<br>
 thinks that this is a test, not a temptation. The word means<br>
 either <b><i>(see on &#175;Mt 4:1)</i></b>, but their motive was evil. They had<br>
 once involved the Baptist with Herod Antipas and Herodias on this<br>
 subject. They may have some such hopes about Jesus, or their<br>
 purpose may have been to see if Jesus will be stricter than Moses<br>
 taught. They knew that he had already spoken in Galilee on the<br>
 subject <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:31f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:3 <B>{What did Moses command you?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti humin eneteilato<br>
 M&#333;us&#275;s;\)</i></b>. Jesus at once brought up the issue concerning the<br>
 teaching of Moses <b><i>(<!-#-->De 24:1)</i></b>. But Jesus goes back beyond this<br>
 concession here allowed by Moses to the ideal state commanded in<br>
 <!-#-->Ge 1:27.<br>
 <br>
 10:4 <B>{To write a bill of divorcement and to put her away}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\biblion apostasiou grapsai kai apolusai\)</i></b>. The word for "bill"<br>
 <b><i>(\biblion\)</i></b> is a diminutive and means "little book," like the<br>
 Latin _libellus_, from which comes our word _libel_ <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>.<br>
 Wycliff has it here "a libel of forsaking." This same point the<br>
 Pharisees raise in <!-#-->Mt 19:7, showing probably that they held to<br>
 the liberal view of Hillel, easy divorce for almost any cause.<br>
 That was the popular view as now. See on &#175;Mt 19:7 for this and<br>
 for discussion of "for your hardness of heart" <b><i>(\skl&#275;rokardia\)</i></b>.<br>
 Jesus expounds the purpose of marriage <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 2:24)</i></b> and takes the<br>
 stricter view of divorce, that of the school of Shammai. See on<br>
 &#175;Mt 19:1-12 for discussion. <!-#-->Mr 10:10 notes that the disciples<br>
 asked Jesus about this problem "in the house" after they had gone<br>
 away from the crowd.<br>
 <br>
 10:11 Mark does not give the exception stated in <!-#-->Mt 19:9<br>
 "except for fornication" which see for discussion, though the<br>
 point is really involved in what Mark does record. Mere formal<br>
 divorce does not annul actual marriage consummated by the<br>
 physical union. Breaking that bond does annul it.<br>
 <br>
 10:12 <B>{If she herself shall put away her husband and marry<br>
 another}</B> <b><i>(\ean aut&#275; apolusasa ton andra aut&#275;s gam&#275;s&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Condition of the third class <b><i>(undetermined, but with prospect of<br>
 determination)</i></b>. Greek and Roman law allowed the divorce of the<br>
 husband by the wife though not provided for in Jewish law. But<br>
 the thing was sometimes done as in the case of Herodias and her<br>
 husband before she married Herod Antipas. So also Salome, Herod's<br>
 sister, divorced her husband. Both Bruce and Gould think that<br>
 Mark added this item to the words of Jesus for the benefit of the<br>
 Gentile environment of this Roman Gospel. But surely Jesus knew<br>
 that the thing was done in the Roman world and hence prohibited<br>
 marrying such a "grass widow."<br>
 <br>
 10:13 <B>{They brought}</B> <b><i>(\prosepheron\)</i></b>. Imperfect active tense,<br>
 implying repetition. So also <!-#-->Lu 18:15, though <!-#-->Mt 19:13 has<br>
 the constative aorist passive <b><i>(\pros&#275;nechth&#275;san\)</i></b>. "This incident<br>
 follows with singular fitness after the Lord's assertion of the<br>
 sanctity of married life" <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. These children <b><i>(\paidia\, Mark<br>
 and Matthew; \breph&#275;\ in Luke)</i></b> were of various ages. They were<br>
 brought to Jesus for his blessing and prayers <b><i>(Matthew)</i></b>. The<br>
 mothers had reverence for Jesus and wanted him to touch<br>
 <b><i>(\haps&#275;tai\)</i></b> them. There was, of course, no question of baptism<br>
 or salvation involved, but a most natural thing to do.<br>
 <br>
 10:14 <B>{He was moved with indignation}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;ganakt&#275;sen\)</i></b>. In Mark<br>
 alone. The word is ingressive aorist, became indignant, and is a<br>
 strong word of deep emotion <b><i>(from \agan\ and \achthomai\, to feel<br>
 pain)</i></b>. Already in <!-#-->Mt 21:15; 26:8. Old and common word. <B>{Suffer<br>
 the little children to come unto me}</B> <b><i>(\aphete ta paidia<br>
 erchesthai pros me\)</i></b>. Mark has the infinitive \erchesthai\ <b><i>(come)</i></b><br>
 not in Matthew, but in Luke. Surely it ought to be a joy to<br>
 parents to bring their children to Jesus, certainly to allow them<br>
 to come, but to hinder their coming is a crime. There are parents<br>
 who will have to give answer to God for keeping their children<br>
 away from Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 10:15 <B>{As a little child}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s paidion\)</i></b>. How does a little<br>
 child receive the kingdom of God? The little child learns to obey<br>
 its parents simply and uncomplainingly. There are some new<br>
 psychologists who argue against teaching obedience to children.<br>
 The results have not been inspiring. Jesus here presents the<br>
 little child with trusting and simple and loving obedience as the<br>
 model for adults in coming into the kingdom. Jesus does not here<br>
 say that children are in the kingdom of God because they are<br>
 children.<br>
 <br>
 10:16 <B>{He took them in his arms}</B> <b><i>(\enagkalisamenos\)</i></b>. A distinct<br>
 rebuke to the protest of the over-particular disciples. This word<br>
 already in <!-#-->Mr 9:36. In <!-#-->Lu 2:28 we have the full idiom, to<br>
 receive into the arms <b><i>(\eis t&#257;s agkalas dechesthai\)</i></b>. So with<br>
 tender fondling Jesus repeatedly blessed <b><i>(\kateulogei\,<br>
 imperfect)</i></b>, laying his hands upon each of them <b><i>(\titheis\,<br>
 present participle)</i></b>. It was a great moment for each mother and<br>
 child.<br>
 <br>
 10:17 <B>{Ran}</B> <b><i>(\prosdram&#333;n\)</i></b>. Jesus had left the house <b><i>(<!-#-->10:10)</i></b><br>
 and was proceeding with the caravan on the way <b><i>(\eis hodon\)</i></b> when<br>
 this ruler eagerly ran and kneeled <b><i>(\gonupet&#275;sas\)</i></b> and was asking<br>
 <b><i>(\ep&#275;r&#333;t&#257;\, imperfect)</i></b> Jesus about his problem. Both these<br>
 details alone in Mark.<br>
 <br>
 10:18 <B>{Why callest thou me good?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti me legeis agathon;\)</i></b>. So<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 18:19. <!-#-->Mt 19:17 has it: "Why asketh thou concerning that<br>
 which is good? "The young ruler was probably sincere and not<br>
 using mere fulsome compliment, but Jesus challenges him to define<br>
 his attitude towards him as was proper. Did he mean "good"<br>
 <b><i>(\agathos\)</i></b> in the absolute sense as applied to God? The language<br>
 is not a disclaiming of deity on the part of Jesus. <B>{That I may<br>
 inherit}</B> <b><i>(\hina kl&#275;ronom&#275;s&#333;\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 19:16 has <b><i>(\sch&#333;\)</i></b>, that I<br>
 may "get."<br>
 <br>
 10:20 <B>{All these}</B> <b><i>(\tauta panta\)</i></b>. Literally, <B>{these all}</B> <b><i>(of<br>
 them)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:21 <B>{Looking upon him loved him}</B> <b><i>(\emblepsas aut&#333;i &#275;gap&#275;sen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Mark alone mentions this glance of affection, ingressive aorist<br>
 participle and verb. Jesus fell in love with this charming youth.<br>
 <B>{One thing thou lackest}</B> <b><i>(\Hen se husterei\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu 18:22 has it:<br>
 "One thing thou lackest yet" <b><i>(\Eti hen soi leipei\)</i></b>. Possibly two<br>
 translations of the same Aramaic phrase. <!-#-->Mt 19:20 represents<br>
 the youth as asking "What lack I yet?" <b><i>(\Ti eti huster&#333;;\)</i></b>. The<br>
 answer of Jesus meets that inquiry after more than mere outward<br>
 obedience to laws and regulations. The verb \huster&#333;\ is from the<br>
 adjective \husteros\ <b><i>(behind)</i></b> and means to be too late, to come<br>
 short, to fail of, to lack. It is used either with the<br>
 accusative, as here, or with the ablative as in <!-#-->2Co 11:5, or<br>
 the dative as in Textus Receptus here, \soi\.<br>
 <br>
 10:22 <B>{But his countenance fell}</B> <b><i>(\ho de stugnasas\)</i></b>. In the LXX<br>
 and Polybius once and in <!-#-->Mt 16:3 <b><i>(passage bracketed by Westcott<br>
 and Hort)</i></b>. The verb is from \stugnos\, sombre, gloomy, like a<br>
 lowering cloud. See on &#175;Mt 19:22 for discussion of "sorrowful"<br>
 <b><i>(\lupoumenos\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:23 <B>{Looked round about}</B> <b><i>(\periblepsamenos\)</i></b>. Another picture<br>
 of the looks of Jesus and in Mark alone as in <!-#-->3:5,34. "To see<br>
 what impression the incident had made on the Twelve" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 "When the man was gone the Lord's eye swept round the circle of<br>
 the Twelve, as he drew for them the lesson of the incident"<br>
 <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. <B>{How hardly}</B> <b><i>(\P&#333;s duskol&#333;s\)</i></b>. So <!-#-->Lu 18:24. <!-#-->Mt 19:23<br>
 has it: "With difficulty <b><i>(\duskol&#333;s\)</i></b> shall a rich man." See on<br>
 Matthew for this word.<br>
 <br>
 10:24 <B>{Were amazed}</B> <b><i>(\ethambounto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive. A look of<br>
 blank astonishment was on their faces at this statement of Jesus.<br>
 They in common with other Jews regarded wealth as a token of<br>
 God's special favour. <B>{Children}</B> <b><i>(\tekna\)</i></b>. Here alone to the<br>
 Twelve and this tender note is due to their growing perplexity.<br>
 <B>{For them that trust in riches}</B> <b><i>(\tous pepoithotas epi tois<br>
 chr&#275;masin\)</i></b>. These words do not occur in Aleph B Delta Memphitic<br>
 and one Old Latin manuscript. Westcott and Hort omit them from<br>
 their text as an evident addition to explain the difficult words<br>
 of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 10:25 <B>{Needle's eye}</B> <b><i>(\trumali&#257;s rhaphidos\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 19:24<br>
 for discussion. Luke uses the surgical needle, \belon&#275;s\. Matthew<br>
 has the word \rhaphis\ like Mark from \rhapt&#333;\, to sew, and it<br>
 appears in the papyri. Both Matthew and Luke employ \tr&#275;matos\<br>
 for eye, a perforation or hole from \titra&#333;\, to bore. Mark's<br>
 word \trumalias\ is from \tru&#333;\, to wear away, to perforate. In<br>
 the LXX and Plutarch.<br>
 <br>
 10:26 <B>{Then who}</B> <b><i>(\kai tis\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 19:25 has \Tis oun\. Evidently<br>
 \kai\ has here an inferential sense like \oun\.<br>
 <br>
 10:27 <B>{Looking on them}</B> <b><i>(\emblepsas autois\)</i></b>. So in <!-#-->Mt 19:26.<br>
 Their amazement increased <b><i>(<!-#-->26)</i></b>. <B>{But not with God}</B> <b><i>(\all' ou<br>
 para the&#333;i\)</i></b>. Locative case with \para\ <b><i>(beside)</i></b>. The impossible<br>
 by the side of men <b><i>(\para anthr&#333;pois\)</i></b> becomes possible by the<br>
 side of God. That is the whole point and brushes to one side all<br>
 petty theories of a gate called needle's eye, etc.<br>
 <br>
 10:28 <B>{Peter began to say}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rxato legein ho Petros\)</i></b>. It was<br>
 hard for Peter to hold in till now. <!-#-->Mt 19:27 says that "Peter<br>
 answered" as if the remark was addressed to him in particular. At<br>
 any rate Peter reminds Jesus of what they had left to follow him,<br>
 four of them that day by the sea <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:20; Mt 4:22; Lu 5:11)</i></b>.<br>
 It was to claim obedience to this high ideal on their part in<br>
 contrast with the conduct of the rich young ruler.<br>
 <br>
 10:30 <B>{With persecutions}</B> <b><i>(\meta di&#333;gm&#333;n\)</i></b>. This extra touch is<br>
 in Mark alone. There is a reminiscence of some of "the<br>
 apocalyptic of the familiar descriptions of the blessings of the<br>
 Messianic kingdom. But Jesus uses such language from the<br>
 religious idiom of this time only to idealize it" <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>. The<br>
 apostles were soon to see the realization of this foreshadowing<br>
 of persecution. Vincent notes that Jesus omits "a hundred wives"<br>
 in this list, showing that Julian the Apostate's sneer on that<br>
 score was without foundation.<br>
 <br>
 10:31 See on &#175;Mt 19:30 for the use of the paradox about <B>{first}</B><br>
 and <B>{last}</B>, probably a rebuke here to Peter's boast.<br>
 <br>
 10:32 <B>{And they were amazed}</B> <b><i>(\kai ethambounto\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense<br>
 describing the feelings of the disciples as Jesus was walking on<br>
 in front of them <b><i>(\&#275;n proag&#333;n autous\, periphrastic imperfect<br>
 active)</i></b>, an unusual circumstance in itself that seemed to bode no<br>
 good as they went on through Perea towards Jerusalem. In fact,<br>
 <B>{they that followed were afraid}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de akolouthountes<br>
 ephobounto\)</i></b> as they looked at Jesus walking ahead in solitude.<br>
 The idiom <b><i>(\hoi de\)</i></b> may not mean that all the disciples were<br>
 afraid, but only some of them. "The Lord walked in advance of the<br>
 Twelve with a solemnity and a determination which foreboded<br>
 danger" <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Lu 9:5. They began to fear coming disaster<br>
 as they neared Jerusalem. They read correctly the face of Jesus.<br>
 <B>{And he took again the twelve}</B> <b><i>(\kai paralab&#333;n tous d&#333;deka\)</i></b>.<br>
 Matthew has "apart" from the crowds and that is what Mark also<br>
 means. Note \paralab&#333;n\, taking to his side. <B>{And began to tell<br>
 them the things that were to happen to him}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rxato autois<br>
 legein ta mellonta aut&#333;i sumbainein\)</i></b>. He had done it before<br>
 three times already <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 8:31; 9:13; 9:31)</i></b>. So Jesus tries once<br>
 more. They had failed utterly heretofore. How is it now? Luke<br>
 adds <b><i>(<!-#-->18:34)</i></b>: "They understood none of these things." But Mark<br>
 and Matthew show how the minds of two of the disciples were<br>
 wholly occupied with plans of their own selfish ambition while<br>
 Jesus was giving details of his approaching death and<br>
 resurrection.<br>
 <br>
 10:35 <B>{There come near unto him James and John}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 prosporeuontai Iak&#333;bos kai I&#333;an&#275;s\)</i></b>. Dramatic present tense.<br>
 Matthew has \tote\, then, showing that the request of the two<br>
 brothers with their mother <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 20:20)</i></b> comes immediately after<br>
 the talk about Christ's death. <B>{We would}</B> <b><i>(\thelomen\)</i></b>. We wish,<br>
 we want, bluntly told. <B>{She came worshipping}</B> <b><i>(\proskunousa\)</i></b><br>
 Matthew says. The mother spoke for the sons. But they try to<br>
 commit Jesus to their desires before they tell what they are,<br>
 just like spoiled children.<br>
 <br>
 10:37 <B>{In thy glory}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i dox&#275;i\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 20:21 has "in thy<br>
 kingdom." See on &#175;Mt 20:20 for the literal interpretation of <!-#-->Mt<br>
 19:28. They are looking for a grand Jewish world empire with<br>
 apocalyptic features in the eschatological culmination of the<br>
 Messiah's kingdom. That dream brushed aside all the talk of Jesus<br>
 about his death and resurrection as mere pessimism.<br>
 <br>
 10:38 <B>{Or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275; to baptisma ho eg&#333; baptizomai baptisth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. Cognate<br>
 accusative with both passive verbs. <!-#-->Mt 20:22 has only the cup,<br>
 but Mark has both the cup and the baptism, both referring to<br>
 death. Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane will refer to his death<br>
 again as "the cup" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:36; Mt 26:39; Lu 22:42)</i></b>. He had<br>
 already used baptism as a figure for his death <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 12:50)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 will use it several times <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:29; Ro 6:3-6; Col 2:12)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:39 See on &#175;Mt 20:23-28 for discussion on these memorable<br>
 verses <b><i>(<!-#-->39-45)</i></b> identical in both Matthew and Mark. In<br>
 particular in verse <!-#-->45 note the language of Jesus concerning<br>
 his death as "a ransom for many" <b><i>(\lutron anti poll&#333;n\)</i></b>, words of<br>
 the Master that were not understood by the apostles when spoken<br>
 by Jesus and which have been preserved for us by Peter through<br>
 Mark. Some today seek to empty these words of all real meaning as<br>
 if Jesus could not have or hold such a conception concerning his<br>
 death for sinners.<br>

 10:45 See on &#175;39<br>
 <br>
 10:46 <B>{From Jericho}</B> <b><i>(\apo Iereich&#333;\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 20:29 for<br>
 discussion of this phrase and Luke's <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 18:35)</i></b> "nigh unto<br>
 Jericho" and the two Jerichos, the old and the new Roman <b><i>(Luke)</i></b>.<br>
 The new Jericho was "about five miles W. of the Jordan and<br>
 fifteen E. of Jerusalem, near the mouth of the _Wady Kelt_, and<br>
 more than a mile south of the site of the ancient town" <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Great multitude}</B> <b><i>(\ochlou hikanou\)</i></b>. Considerable, more than<br>
 sufficient. Often in Luke and the papyri in this sense. See <!-#-->Mt<br>
 3:11 for the other sense of fit for \hikanos\. <B>{Bartimaeus}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Bartimaios\)</i></b>. Aramaic name like Bartholomew, \bar\ meaning son<br>
 like Hebrew _ben_. So Mark explains the name meaning "the son of<br>
 Timaeus" <b><i>(\ho huios Timaiou\)</i></b>. Mark alone gives his name while<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 20:30 mentions two which see for discussion. <B>{Blind beggar}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\tuphlos prosait&#275;s\)</i></b>, "begging" <b><i>(\epait&#333;n\)</i></b> Luke has it <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 18:35)</i></b>. All three Gospels picture him as <B>{sitting by the<br>
 roadside}</B> <b><i>(\ekath&#275;to para t&#275;n hodon\)</i></b>. It was a common sight.<br>
 Bartimaeus had his regular place. Vincent quotes Thomson<br>
 concerning Ramleh: "I once walked the streets counting all that<br>
 were either blind or had defective eyes, and it amounted to about<br>
 one-half the male population. The women I could not count, for<br>
 they are rigidly veiled" <b><i>(_The Land and the Book_)</i></b>. The dust, the<br>
 glare of the sun, the unsanitary habits of the people spread<br>
 contagious eye-diseases.<br>
 <br>
 10:48 <B>{Rebuked him}</B> <b><i>(\epetim&#333;n aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense. Kept<br>
 rebuking repeatedly. So <!-#-->Lu 18:39. Aorist tense in <!-#-->Mt 20:31.<br>
 <B>{Should hold his peace}</B> <b><i>(\si&#333;p&#275;s&#275;i\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist<br>
 subjunctive, become silent. <B>{The more a great deal}</B> <b><i>(\poll&#333;i<br>
 m&#257;llon\)</i></b>. So <!-#-->Lu 18:39. Only \meizon\ in <!-#-->Mt 20:31.<br>
 <br>
 10:49 <B>{Stood still}</B> <b><i>(\stas\)</i></b>. Second aorist active ingressive<br>
 participle. So <!-#-->Mt 20:32. <!-#-->Lu 18:40 has \statheis\, aorist<br>
 passive participle. <B>{He calleth thee}</B> <b><i>(\ph&#333;nei se\)</i></b>. That was<br>
 joyful news to Bartimaeus. Vivid dramatic presents here in Mark.<br>
 <br>
 10:50 <B>{Casting away his garment}</B> <b><i>(\apobal&#333;n to himation autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist active participle. Outer robe in his haste. <B>{Sprang<br>
 up}</B> <b><i>(\anap&#275;d&#275;sas\)</i></b>. Leaping up, vivid details again in Mark.<br>
 <br>
 10:51 <B>{That I should do}</B> <b><i>(\poi&#275;s&#333;\)</i></b>. Neat Greek idiom with aorist<br>
 subjunctive without \hina\ after \theleis\. For this asyndeton<br>
 <b><i>(or parataxis)</i></b> see Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 430. <B>{Rabboni}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Rabbounei\)</i></b>. The Aramaic word translated Lord <b><i>(Kurie)</i></b> in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 20:33 and <!-#-->Lu 18:41. This very form occurs again in <!-#-->Joh<br>
 20:16. <B>{That I may receive my sight}</B> <b><i>(\hina anableps&#333;\)</i></b>. To<br>
 recover sight <b><i>(\ana-\)</i></b>, see again. Apparently he had once been<br>
 able to see. Here \hina\ is used though \thel&#333;\ is not <b><i>(cf.<br>
 <!-#-->10:35)</i></b>. The Messiah was expected to give sight to the blind<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 61:1; Lu 4:18; 7:22)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:52 <B>{Followed}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kolouthei\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense picturing joyful<br>
