 <HR>
<p>16:1 <B>{The Pharisees and Sadducees}</B> <b><i>(\hoi Pharisaioi kai<br>
 Saddoukaioi\)</i></b>. The first time that we have this combination of<br>
 the two parties who disliked each other exceedingly. Hate makes<br>
 strange bedfellows. They hated Jesus more than they did each<br>
 other. Their hostility has not decreased during the absence of<br>
 Jesus, but rather increased. <B>{Tempting him}</B> <b><i>(\peirazontes\)</i></b>.<br>
 Their motive was bad. <B>{A sign from heaven}</B> <b><i>(\s&#275;meion ek tou<br>
 ouranou\)</i></b>. The scribes and Pharisees had already asked for a sign<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->12:38)</i></b>. Now this new combination adds "from heaven." What did<br>
 they have in mind? They may not have had any definite idea to<br>
 embarrass Jesus. The Jewish apocalypses did speak of spectacular<br>
 displays of power by the Son of Man <b><i>(the Messiah)</i></b>. The devil had<br>
 suggested that Jesus let the people see him drop down from the<br>
 pinnacle of the temple and the people expected the Messiah to<br>
 come from an unknown source <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 7:27)</i></b> who would do great signs<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 7:31)</i></b>. Chrysostom <b><i>(_Hom_. liii.)</i></b> suggests stopping the<br>
 course of the sun, bridling the moon, a clap of thunder.<br>
 <br>
 16:2 <B>{Fair weather}</B> <b><i>(\eudia\)</i></b>. An old poetic word from \eu\ and<br>
 \Zeus\ as the ruler of the air and giver of fair weather. So men<br>
 today say "when the sky is red at sunset." It occurs on the<br>
 Rosetta Stone and in a fourth century A.D. Oxyr. papyrus for<br>
 "calm weather" that made it impossible to sail the boat. Aleph<br>
 and B and some other MSS. omit verses 2 and 3. W omits part of<br>
 verse 2. These verses are similar to <!-#-->Lu 12:54-56. McNeile<br>
 rejects them here. Westcott and Hort place in brackets. Jesus<br>
 often repeated his sayings. Zahn suggests that Papias added these<br>
 words to Matthew.<br>
 <br>
 16:3 <B>{Lowring}</B> <b><i>(\stugnaz&#333;n\)</i></b>. A sky covered with clouds. Used<br>
 also of a gloomy countenance as of the rich young ruler in <!-#-->Mr<br>
 10:22. Nowhere else in the New Testament. This very sign of a<br>
 rainy day we use today. The word for "foul weather" <b><i>(\cheim&#333;n\)</i></b><br>
 is the common one for winter and a storm. <B>{The signs of the<br>
 times}</B> <b><i>(\ta s&#275;meia t&#333;n kair&#333;n\)</i></b>. How little the Pharisees and<br>
 Sadducees understood the situation. Soon Jerusalem would be<br>
 destroyed and the Jewish state overturned. It is not always easy<br>
 to discern <b><i>(\diakrinein\, discriminate)</i></b> the signs of our own<br>
 time. Men are numerous with patent keys to it all. But we ought<br>
 not to be blind when others are gullible.<br>
 <br>
 16:4 Same words in <!-#-->12:39 except \tou proph&#275;tou\, a real<br>
 doublet.<br>
 <br>
 16:5 <B>{Came}</B> <b><i>(\elthontes\)</i></b>. Probably= "went" as in <!-#-->Lu 15:20<br>
 <b><i>(\ire\, not \venire\)</i></b>. So in <!-#-->Mr 8:13 \ap&#275;lthen\. <B>{Forgot}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epelathonto\)</i></b>. Perhaps in the hurry to leave Galilee, probably<br>
 in the same boat by which they came across from Decapolis.<br>
 <br>
 16:7 <B>{They reasoned}</B> <b><i>(\dielogizonto\)</i></b>. It was pathetic, the<br>
 almost jejune inability of the disciples to understand the<br>
 parabolic warning against "the leaven of the Pharisees and<br>
 Sadducees" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->6)</i></b> after the collision of Christ just before<br>
 with both parties in Magadan. They kept it up, imperfect tense.<br>
 It is "loaves" <b><i>(\artous\)</i></b> rather than "bread."<br>
 <br>
 16:8 Jesus asks four pungent questions about the intellectual<br>
 dulness, refers to the feeding of the five thousand and uses the<br>
 word \kophinous\ <b><i>(<!-#-->14:20)</i></b> for it and \sphuridas\ for the four<br>
 thousand <b><i>(<!-#-->15:37)</i></b>, and repeats his warning <b><i>(<!-#-->16:11)</i></b>. Every<br>
 teacher understands this strain upon the patience of this Teacher<br>
 of teachers.<br>
 <br>
 16:12 <B>{Then understood they}</B> <b><i>(\tote sun&#275;kan\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active indicative of \suni&#275;mi\, to grasp, to comprehend. They saw<br>
 the point after this elaborate rebuke and explanation that by<br>
 "leaven" Jesus meant "teaching."<br>
 <br>
 16:13 <B>{Caesarea Philippi}</B> <b><i>(\Kaisarias t&#275;s Philippou\)</i></b>. Up on a<br>
 spur of Mt. Hermon under the rule of Herod Philip. <B>{He asked}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;r&#333;t&#257;\)</i></b>. Began to question, inchoative imperfect tense. He was<br>
 giving them a test or examination. The first was for the opinion<br>
 of men about the Son of Man.<br>
 <br>
 16:14 <B>{And they said}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de eipan\)</i></b>. They were ready to<br>
 respond for they knew that popular opinion was divided on that<br>
 point <b><i>(<!-#-->14:1f.)</i></b>. They give four different opinions. It is always<br>
 a risky thing for a pastor to ask for people's opinions of him.<br>
 But Jesus was not much concerned by their answers to this<br>
 question. He knew by now that the Pharisees and Sadducees were<br>
 bitterly hostile to him. The masses were only superficially<br>
 following him and they looked for a political Messiah and had<br>
 vague ideas about him. How much did the disciples understand and<br>
 how far have they come in their development of faith? Are they<br>
 still loyal?<br>
 <br>
 16:15 <B>{But who say ye that I am?}</B> <b><i>(\h&#8211;meis de tina me legete<br>
 einai?\)</i></b>. This is what matters and what Jesus wanted to hear.<br>
 Note emphatic position of <B>{h&#8211;meis}</B>, "But _you_, who say ye that I<br>
 am?"<br>
 <br>
 16:16 Peter is the spokesman now: "Thou art the Christ, the Son<br>
 of the living God" <b><i>(\Su ei ho Christos ho huios tou theou tou<br>
 z&#333;ntos\)</i></b>. It was a noble confession, but not a new claim by<br>
 Jesus. Peter had made it before <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:69)</i></b> when the multitude<br>
 deserted Jesus in Capernaum. Since the early ministry <b><i>(John 4)</i></b><br>
 Jesus had avoided the word Messiah because of its political<br>
 meaning to the people. But now Peter plainly calls Jesus the<br>
 Anointed One, the Messiah, the Son of the God the living one<br>
 <b><i>(note the four Greek articles)</i></b>. This great confession of Peter<br>
 means that he and the other disciples believe in Jesus as the<br>
 Messiah and are still true to him in spite of the defection of<br>
 the Galilean populace <b><i>(John 6)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:17 <B>{Blessed art thou}</B> <b><i>(\makarios ei\)</i></b>. A beatitude for Peter.<br>
 Jesus accepts the confession as true. Thereby Jesus on this<br>
 solemn occasion solemnly claims to be the Messiah, the Son of the<br>
 living God, his deity in other words. The disciples express<br>
 positive conviction in the Messiahship or Christhood of Jesus as<br>
 opposed to the divided opinions of the populace. "The terms in<br>
 which Jesus speaks of Peter are characteristic--warm, generous,<br>
 unstinted. The style is not that of an ecclesiastical editor<br>
 laying the foundation for church power, and prelatic pretentions,<br>
 but of a noble-minded Master eulogizing in impassioned terms a<br>
 loyal disciple" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. The Father had helped Peter get this<br>
 spiritual insight into the Master's Person and Work.<br>
 <br>
 16:18 <B>{And I also say unto thee}</B> <b><i>(\k'ag&#333; de soi leg&#333;\)</i></b>. "The<br>
 emphasis is not on 'Thou art Peter' over against 'Thou art the<br>
 Christ,' but on \Kag&#333;\: 'The Father hath revealed to thee one<br>
 truth, and I also tell you another" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. Jesus calls Peter<br>
 here by the name that he had said he would have <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:42)</i></b>.<br>
 Peter <b><i>(\Petros\)</i></b> is simply the Greek word for Cephas <b><i>(Aramaic)</i></b>.<br>
 Then it was prophecy, now it is fact. In verse <!-#-->17 Jesus<br>
 addresses him as "Simon Bar-Jonah," his full patronymic <b><i>(Aramaic)</i></b><br>
 name. But Jesus has a purpose now in using his nickname "Peter"<br>
 which he had himself given him. Jesus makes a remarkable play on<br>
 Peter's name, a pun in fact, that has caused volumes of<br>
 controversy and endless theological strife. <B>{On this rock}</B> <b><i>(\epi<br>
 taut&#275;i t&#275;i petr&#257;i\)</i></b> Jesus says, a ledge or cliff of rock like<br>
 that in <!-#-->7:24 on which the wise man built his house. \Petros\ is<br>
 usually a smaller detachment of the massive ledge. But too much<br>
 must not be made of this point since Jesus probably spoke Aramaic<br>
 to Peter which draws no such distinction <b><i>(\K&#275;ph&#257;\)</i></b>. What did<br>
 Jesus mean by this word-play?<br>
 <br>
 <B>{I will build my church}</B> <b><i>(\oikodom&#275;s&#333; mou t&#275;n ekkl&#275;sian\)</i></b>. It is<br>
 the figure of a building and he uses the word \ekkl&#275;sian\ which<br>
 occurs in the New Testament usually of a local organization, but<br>
 sometimes in a more general sense. What is the sense here in<br>
 which Jesus uses it? The word originally meant "assembly" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 19:39)</i></b>, but it came to be applied to an "unassembled assembly"<br>
 as in <!-#-->Ac 8:3 for the Christians persecuted by Saul from house<br>
 to house. "And the name for the new Israel, \ekkl&#275;sia\, in His<br>
 mouth is not an anachronism. It is an old familiar name for the<br>
 congregation of Israel found in Deut. <b><i>(<!-#-->De 18:26; 23:2)</i></b> and<br>
 Psalms <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps 22:36)</i></b>, both books well known to Jesus" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. It<br>
 is interesting to observe that in <!-#-->Ps 89 most of the important<br>
 words employed by Jesus on this occasion occur in the LXX text.<br>
 So \oikodom&#275;s&#333;\ in <!-#-->Ps 89:5; \ekkl&#275;sia\ in <!-#-->Ps 89:6;<br>
 \katischu&#333;\ in <!-#-->Ps 89:22; \Christos\ in <!-#-->Ps 89:39,52; \h&#257;id&#275;s\<br>
 in <!-#-->Ps 89:49 <b><i>(\ek cheiros h&#257;idou\)</i></b>. If one is puzzled over the<br>
 use of "building" with the word \ekkl&#275;sia\ it will be helpful to<br>
 turn to <!-#-->1Pe 2:5. Peter, the very one to whom Jesus is here<br>
 speaking, writing to the Christians in the five Roman provinces<br>
 in Asia <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 1:1)</i></b>, says: "You are built a spiritual house"<br>
 <b><i>(\oikodomeisthe oikos pneumatikos\)</i></b>. It is difficult to resist<br>
 the impression that Peter recalls the words of Jesus to him on<br>
 this memorable occasion. Further on <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 2:9)</i></b> he speaks of them<br>
 as an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, showing<br>
 beyond controversy that Peter's use of building a spiritual house<br>
 is general, not local. This is undoubtedly the picture in the<br>
 mind of Christ here in <!-#-->16:18. It is a great spiritual house,<br>
 Christ's Israel, not the Jewish nation, which he describes. What<br>
 is the rock on which Christ will build his vast temple? Not on<br>
 Peter alone or mainly or primarily. Peter by his confession was<br>
 furnished with the illustration for the rock on which His church<br>
 will rest. It is the same kind of faith that Peter has just<br>
 confessed. The perpetuity of this church general is guaranteed.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{The gates of Hades}</B> <b><i>(\pulai h&#257;idou\)</i></b> <B>{shall not prevail against<br>
 it}</B> <b><i>(\ou katischusousin aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Each word here creates<br>
 difficulty. Hades is technically the unseen world, the Hebrew<br>
 Sheol, the land of the departed, that is death. Paul uses<br>
 \thanate\ in <!-#-->1Co 15:55 in quoting <!-#-->Ho 13:14 for \h&#257;id&#275;\. It is<br>
 not common in the papyri, but it is common on tombstones in Asia<br>
 Minor, "doubtless a survival of its use in the old Greek<br>
 religion" <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan, _Vocabulary_)</i></b>. The ancient<br>
 pagans divided Hades <b><i>(\a\ privative and \idein\, to see, abode of<br>
 the unseen)</i></b> into Elysium and Tartarus as the Jews put both<br>
 Abraham's bosom and Gehenna in Sheol or Hades <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Lu 16:25)</i></b>.<br>
 Christ was in Hades <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 2:27,31)</i></b>, not in Gehenna. We have here<br>
 the figure of two buildings, the Church of Christ on the Rock,<br>
 the House of Death <b><i>(Hades)</i></b>. "In the Old Testament the 'gates of<br>
 Hades' <b><i>(Sheol)</i></b> never bears any other meaning <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 38:10; Wisd.<br>
 16:3; 3Macc. 5:51)</i></b> than death," McNeile claims. See also <!-#-->Ps<br>
 9:13; 107:18; Job 38:17 <b><i>(\pulai thanatou pul&#333;roi h&#257;idou\)</i></b>. It is<br>
 not the picture of Hades _attacking_ Christ's church, but of<br>
 death's possible victory over the church. "The \ekkl&#275;sia\ is<br>
 built upon the Messiahship of her master, and death, the gates of<br>
 Hades, will not prevail against her by keeping Him imprisoned. It<br>
 was a mysterious truth, which He will soon tell them in plain<br>
 words <b><i>(verse <!-#-->21)</i></b>; it is echoed in <!-#-->Ac 2:24,31" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 Christ's church will prevail and survive because He will burst<br>
 the gates of Hades and come forth conqueror. He will ever live<br>
 and be the guarantor of the perpetuity of His people or church.<br>
 The verb \katischu&#333;\ <b><i>(literally have strength against, \ischu&#333;\<br>
 from \ischus\ and \kat-\)</i></b> occurs also in <!-#-->Lu 21:36; 23:23. It<br>
 appears in the ancient Greek, the LXX, and in the papyri with the<br>
 accusative and is used in the modern Greek with the sense of<br>
 gaining the mastery over. The wealth of imagery in <!-#-->Mt 16:18<br>
 makes it difficult to decide each detail, but the main point is<br>
 clear. The \ekkl&#275;sia\ which consists of those confessing Christ<br>
 as Peter has just done will not cease. The gates of Hades or bars<br>
 of Sheol will not close down on it. Christ will rise and will<br>
 keep his church alive. _Sublime Porte_ used to be the title of<br>
 Turkish power in Constantinople.<br>
 <br>
 16:19 <B>{The Keys of the kingdom}</B> <b><i>(\tas kleidas t&#275;s basileias\)</i></b>.<br>
 Here again we have the figure of a building with keys to open<br>
 from the outside. The question is raised at once if Jesus does<br>
 not here mean the same thing by "kingdom" that he did by "church"<br>
 in verse <!-#-->18. In <!-#-->Re 1:18; 3:7 Christ the Risen Lord has "the<br>
 keys of death and of Hades." He has also "the keys of the kingdom<br>
 of heaven" which he here hands over to Peter as "gatekeeper" or<br>
 "steward" <b><i>(\oikonomos\)</i></b> provided we do not understand it as a<br>
 special and peculiar prerogative belonging to Peter. The same<br>
 power here given to Peter belongs to every disciple of Jesus in<br>
 all the ages. Advocates of papal supremacy insist on the primacy<br>
 of Peter here and the power of Peter to pass on this supposed<br>
 sovereignty to others. But this is all quite beside the mark. We<br>
 shall soon see the disciples actually disputing again <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 18:1)</i></b><br>
 as to which of them is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven as<br>
 they will again <b><i>(<!-#-->20:21)</i></b> and even on the night before Christ's<br>
 death. Clearly neither Peter nor the rest understood Jesus to say<br>
 here that Peter was to have supreme authority. What is added<br>
 shows that Peter held the keys precisely as every preacher and<br>
 teacher does. To "bind" <b><i>(\d&#275;s&#275;is\)</i></b> in rabbinical language is to<br>
 forbid, to "loose" <b><i>(\lus&#275;is\)</i></b> is to permit. Peter would be like a<br>
 rabbi who passes on many points. Rabbis of the school of Hillel<br>
 "loosed" many things that the school of Schammai "bound." The<br>
 teaching of Jesus is the standard for Peter and for all preachers<br>
 of Christ. Note the future perfect indicative <b><i>(\estai dedemenon,<br>
 estai lelumenon\)</i></b>, a state of completion. All this assumes, of<br>
 course, that Peter's use of the keys will be in accord with the<br>
 teaching and mind of Christ. The binding and loosing is repeated<br>
 by Jesus to all the disciples <b><i>(<!-#-->18:18)</i></b>. Later after the<br>
 Resurrection Christ will use this same language to all the<br>
 disciples <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 20:23)</i></b>, showing that it was not a special<br>
 prerogative of Peter. He is simply first among equals, _primus<br>
 inter pares_, because on this occasion he was spokesman for the<br>
 faith of all. It is a violent leap in logic to claim power to<br>
 forgive sins, to pronounce absolution, by reason of the technical<br>
 rabbinical language that Jesus employed about binding and<br>
 loosing. Every preacher uses the keys of the kingdom when he<br>
 proclaims the terms of salvation in Christ. The proclamation of<br>
 these terms when accepted by faith in Christ has the sanction and<br>
 approval of God the Father. The more personal we make these great<br>
 words the nearer we come to the mind of Christ. The more<br>
 ecclesiastical we make them the further we drift away from him.<br>
 <br>
 16:20 <B>{That they should tell no man}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275;deni eip&#333;sin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Why? For the very reason that he had himself avoided this claim<br>
 in public. He was the Messiah <b><i>(\ho Christos\)</i></b>, but the people<br>
 would inevitably take it in a political sense. Jesus was plainly<br>
 profoundly moved by Peter's great confession on behalf of the<br>
 disciples. He was grateful and confident of the final outcome.<br>
 But he foresaw peril to all. Peter had confessed him as the<br>
 Messiah and on this rock of faith thus confessed he would build<br>
 his church or kingdom. They will all have and use the keys to<br>
 this greatest of all buildings, but for the present they must be<br>
 silent.<br>
 <br>
 16:21 <B>{From that time began}</B> <b><i>(\apo tote &#275;rxato\)</i></b>. It was a<br>
 suitable time for the disclosure of the greatest secret of his<br>
 death. It is now just a little over six months before the cross.<br>
 They must know it now to be ready then. The great confession of<br>
 Peter made this seem an appropriate time. He will repeat the<br>
 warnings <b><i>(<!-#-->17:22f. with mention of betrayal; <!-#-->20:17-19 with the<br>
 cross)</i></b> which he now "began." So the necessity <b><i>(\dei\, must)</i></b> of<br>
 his suffering death at the hands of the Jerusalem ecclesiastics<br>
 who have dogged his steps in Galilee is now plainly stated. Jesus<br>
 added his resurrection "on the third day" <b><i>(\t&#275;i trit&#275;i h&#275;mer&#257;i\)</i></b>,<br>
 not "on the fourth day," please observe. Dimly the shocked<br>
 disciples grasped something of what Jesus said.<br>
 <br>
 16:22 <B>{Peter took him}</B> <b><i>(\proslabomenos auton ho Petros\)</i></b>. Middle<br>
 voice, "taking to himself," aside and apart, "as if by a right of<br>
 his own. He acted with greater familiarity after the token of<br>
 acknowledgment had been given. Jesus, however, reduces him to his<br>
 level" <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>. "Peter here appears in a new character; a minute<br>
 ago speaking under inspiration from heaven, now under inspiration<br>
 from the opposite quarter" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Syriac Sinaitic for <!-#-->Mr 8:32<br>
 has it "as though pitying him." But this exclamation and<br>
 remonstrance of Peter was soon interrupted by Jesus. <B>{God have<br>
 mercy on thee}</B> <b><i>(\hile&#333;s\. Supply \ei&#275;\ or \est&#333; ho theos\)</i></b>. <B>{This<br>
 shall never be}</B> <b><i>(\ou m&#275; estai soi touto\)</i></b>. Strongest kind of<br>
 negation, as if Peter would not let it happen. Peter had perfect<br>
 assurance.<br>
 <br>
 16:23 <B>{But he turned}</B> <b><i>(\ho de strapheis\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive<br>
 participle, quick ingressive action, away from Peter in<br>
 revulsion, and toward the other disciples <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 8:33 has<br>
 \epistrapheis\ and \id&#333;n tous math&#275;tas autou\)</i></b>. <B>{Get thee behind<br>
 me, Satan}</B> <b><i>(\Hupage opis&#333; mou, Satan&#257;\)</i></b>. Just before Peter played<br>
 the part of a rock in the noble confession and was given a place<br>
 of leadership. Now he is playing the part of Satan and is ordered<br>
 to the rear. Peter was tempting Jesus not to go on to the cross<br>
 as Satan had done in the wilderness. "None are more formidable<br>
 instruments of temptation than well-meaning friends, who care<br>
 more for our comfort than for our character" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. "In Peter<br>
 the banished Satan had once more returned" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{A<br>
 stumbling-block unto me}</B> <b><i>(\skandalon ei emou\)</i></b>. Objective<br>
 genitive. Peter was acting as Satan's catspaw, in ignorance,<br>
 surely, but none the less really. He had set a trap for Christ<br>
 that would undo all his mission to earth. "Thou art not, as<br>
 before, a noble block, lying in its right position as a massive<br>
 foundation stone. On the contrary, thou art like a stone quite<br>
 out of its proper place, and lying right across the road in which<br>
 I must go--lying as a stone of stumbling" <b><i>(Morison)</i></b>. <B>{Thou<br>
 mindest not}</B> <b><i>(\ou phroneis\)</i></b>. "Your outlook is not God's, but<br>
 man's" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>. You do not think God's thoughts. Clearly the<br>
 consciousness of the coming cross is not a new idea with Jesus.<br>
 We do not know when he first foresaw this outcome any more than<br>
 we know when first the Messianic consciousness appeared in Jesus.<br>
 He had the glimmerings of it as a boy of twelve, when he spoke of<br>
 "My Father's house." He knows now that he must die on the cross.<br>
 <br>
 16:24 <B>{Take up his cross}</B> <b><i>(\arat&#333; ton stauron autou\)</i></b>. Pick up at<br>
 once, aorist tense. This same saying in <!-#-->10:38, which see. But<br>
 pertinent here also in explanation of Christ's rebuke to Peter.<br>
 Christ's own cross faces him. Peter had dared to pull Christ away<br>
 from his destiny. He would do better to face squarely his own<br>
 cross and to bear it after Jesus. The disciples would be familiar<br>
 with cross-bearing as a figure of speech by reason of the<br>
 crucifixion of criminals in Jerusalem. <B>{Follow}</B> <b><i>(\akaloutheit&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present tense. Keep on following.<br>
 <br>
 16:25 <B>{Save his life}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n psuch&#275;n autou s&#333;sai\)</i></b>. Paradoxical<br>
 play on word "life" or "soul," using it in two senses. So about<br>
 "saving" and "losing" <b><i>(\apolesei\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:26 <B>{Gain}</B> <b><i>(\kerd&#275;s&#275;i\)</i></b> and <B>{profit}</B> <b><i>(\z&#275;mi&#333;th&#275;i\)</i></b>. Both aorist<br>
 subjunctives <b><i>(one active, the other passive)</i></b> and so punctiliar<br>
 action, condition of third class, undetermined, but with prospect<br>
 of determination. Just a supposed case. The verb for "forfeit"<br>
 occurs in the sense of being fined or mulcted of money. So the<br>
 papyri and inscriptions. <B>{Exchange}</B> <b><i>(\antallagma\)</i></b>. As an<br>
 exchange, accusative in apposition with \ti\. The soul has no<br>
 market price, though the devil thinks so. "A man must give,<br>
 surrender, his life, and nothing less to God; no \antallagma\ is<br>
 possible" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. This word \antallagma\ occurs twice in the<br>
 _Wisdom of Sirach_: "There is no exchange for a faithful friend"<br>
 <b><i>(6:15)</i></b>; "There is no exchange for a well-instructed soul"<br>
 <b><i>(26:14)</i></b>.<br>

 16:28 <B>{Some of them that stand here}</B> <b><i>(\tines t&#333;n hode hest&#333;t&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 A _crux interpretum_ in reality. Does Jesus refer to the<br>
 Transfiguration, the Resurrection of Jesus, the great Day of<br>
 Pentecost, the Destruction of Jerusalem, the Second Coming and<br>
 Judgment? We do not know, only that Jesus was certain of his<br>
 final victory which would be typified and symbolized in various<br>
 ways. The apocalyptic eschatological symbolism employed by Jesus<br>
 here does not dominate his teaching. He used it at times to<br>
 picture the triumph of the kingdom, not to set forth the full<br>
 teaching about it. The kingdom of God was already in the hearts<br>
 of men. There would be climaxes and consummations.<br>
