<p>5:1 <B>{The Gerasenes}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n Geras&#275;n&#333;n\)</i></b>. Like <!-#-->Lu 8:26 while <!-#-->Mt<br>
 8:28 has "the Gadarenes." The ruins of the village Khersa<br>
 <b><i>(Gerasa)</i></b> probably point to this site which is in the district of<br>
 Gadara some six miles southeastward, not to the city of Gerasa<br>
 some thirty miles away.<br>
 <br>
 5:2 <B>{Out of the boat}</B> <b><i>(\ek tou ploiou\)</i></b>. Straightway <b><i>(\euthus\)</i></b><br>
 Mark says, using the genitive absolute <b><i>(\exelthontos autou\)</i></b> and<br>
 then repeating \aut&#333;i\ associative instrumental after<br>
 \ap&#275;nt&#275;sen\. The demoniac greeted Jesus at once. Mark and <!-#-->Lu<br>
 9:27 mention only one man while Matthew notes two demoniacs,<br>
 perhaps one more violent than the other. Each of the Gospels has<br>
 a different phrase. Mark has "a man with an unclean spirit" <b><i>(\en<br>
 pneumati akathart&#333;i\)</i></b>, <!-#-->Mt 8:28 "two possessed with demons"<br>
 <b><i>(\duo daimonizomenoi\)</i></b>, <!-#-->Lu 8:27 "one having demons" <b><i>(\tis ech&#333;n<br>
 daimonia\)</i></b>. Mark has many touches about this miracle not retained<br>
 in Matthew and Luke. See on &#175;Mt 8:28.<br>
 <br>
 5:3 <B>{No man could any more bind him, no, not with a chain}</B> <b><i>(\oude<br>
 halusei oudeis edunato auton d&#275;sai\)</i></b>. Instrumental case<br>
 \halusei\, a handcuff <b><i>(\a\ privative and \lu&#333;\, to loosen)</i></b>. But<br>
 this demoniac snapped a handcuff as if a string.<br>
 <br>
 5:4 <B>{Often bound}</B> <b><i>(\pollakis dedesthai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 infinitive, state of completion. With fetters <b><i>(\pedais\, from<br>
 \peza\, foot, instep)</i></b> and chains, bound hand and foot, but all to<br>
 no purpose. The English plural of foot is feet <b><i>(Anglo-Saxon<br>
 _fot_, _fet_)</i></b> and fetter is _feeter_. <B>{Rent asunder}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\diesp&#257;sthai\)</i></b>. Drawn <b><i>(\spa&#333;\)</i></b> in two <b><i>(\dia-\ same root as<br>
 \duo\, two)</i></b>. Perfect passive infinitive. <B>{Broken in pieces}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\suntetriphthai\.)</i></b> Perfect passive infinitive again, from<br>
 \suntrib&#333;\, to rub together. Rubbed together, crushed together.<br>
 Perhaps the neighbours who told the story could point to broken<br>
 fragments of chains and fetters. The fetters may have been cords,<br>
 or even wooden stocks and not chains. <B>{No man had strength to<br>
 tame him}</B> <b><i>(\oudeis ischuen auton damasai\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense. He<br>
 roamed at will like a lion in the jungle.<br>
 <br>
 5:5 <B>{He was crying out, and cutting himself with stones}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n<br>
 kraz&#333;n kai katakopt&#333;n heauton lithois\)</i></b>. Further vivid details by<br>
 Mark. Night and day his loud scream or screech could be heard<br>
 like other demoniacs <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1:26; 3:11; 9:26)</i></b>. The verb for<br>
 cutting himself occurs here only in the N.T., though an old verb.<br>
 It means to _cut down_ <b><i>(perfective use of \kata-\)</i></b>. We say _cut<br>
 up_, gash, hack to pieces. Perhaps he was scarred all over with<br>
 such gashes during his moments of wild frenzy night and day in<br>
 the tombs and on the mountains. Periphrastic imperfect active<br>
 with \&#275;n\ and the participles.<br>
 <br>
 5:6 <B>{Ran and worshipped}</B> <b><i>(\edramen kai prosekun&#275;sen\)</i></b>. "At first<br>
 perhaps with hostile intentions. The onrush of the naked yelling<br>
 maniac must have tried the newly recovered confidence of the<br>
 Twelve. We can imagine their surprise when, on approaching, he<br>
 threw himself on his knees" <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:7 <B>{I adjure thee by God}</B> <b><i>(\horkiz&#333; se ton theon\)</i></b>. The demoniac<br>
 puts Jesus on oath <b><i>(two accusatives)</i></b> after the startled outcry<br>
 just like the one in <!-#-->1:24, which see. He calls Jesus here "son<br>
 of the Most High God" <b><i>(\huie tou theou tou hupsistou\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 8:28 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ge 14:18f.)</i></b>. <B>{Torment me not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; me basanis&#275;is\)</i></b>.<br>
 Prohibition with \m&#275;\ and the ingressive aorist subjunctive. The<br>
 word means to test metals and then to test one by torture <b><i>(cf.<br>
 our "third degree")</i></b>. Same word in all three Gospels.<br>
 <br>
 5:8 <B>{For he said}</B> <b><i>(\elegen gar\)</i></b>. For he had been saying<br>
 <b><i>(progressive imperfect)</i></b>. Jesus had already repeatedly ordered the<br>
 demon to come out of the man whereat the demon made his outcry to<br>
 Jesus and protested. <!-#-->Mt 8:29 had "before the time" <b><i>(\pro<br>
 kairou\)</i></b> and <!-#-->8:31 shows that the demons did not want to go back<br>
 to the abyss <b><i>(\t&#275;n abusson\)</i></b> right now. That was their real home,<br>
 but they did not wish to return to the place of torment just now.<br>
 <br>
 5:9 <B>{My name is Legion}</B> <b><i>(\Legi&#333;n onoma moi\)</i></b>. So <!-#-->Lu 8:30, but<br>
 not Matthew. Latin word <b><i>(_legio_)</i></b>. A full Roman legion had 6,826<br>
 men. See on &#175;Mt 26:53. This may not have been a full legion, for<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 5:13 notes that the number of hogs was "about two thousand."<br>
 Of course, a stickler for words might say that each hog had<br>
 several demons.<br>
 <br>
 5:13 <B>{And he gave them leave}</B> <b><i>(\kai epetrepsen autois\)</i></b>. These<br>
 words present the crucial difficulty for interpreters as to why<br>
 Jesus allowed the demons to enter the hogs and destroy them<br>
 instead of sending them back to the abyss. Certainly it was<br>
 better for hogs to perish than men, but this loss of property<br>
 raises a difficulty of its own akin to the problem of tornadoes<br>
 and earthquakes. The question of one man containing so many<br>
 demons is difficult also, but not much more so than how one demon<br>
 can dwell in a man and make his home there. One is reminded of<br>
 the man out of whom a demon was cast, but the demon came back<br>
 with seven other demons and took possession. Gould thinks that<br>
 this man with a legion of demons merely makes a historical<br>
 exaggeration. "I feel as if I were possessed by a thousand<br>
 devils." That is too easy an explanation. See on &#175;Mt 8:32 for<br>
 "rushed down the steep." <B>{They were choked}</B> <b><i>(\epnigonto\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect tense picturing graphically the disappearance of pig<br>
 after pig in the sea. <!-#-->Lu 8:33 has \apegnig&#275;\, <B>{choked off}</B>,<br>
 constative second aorist passive indicative, treated as a whole,<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 8:32 merely has "perished" <b><i>(\apethanon\; died)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:14 <B>{And in the country}</B> <b><i>(\kai eis tous agrous\)</i></b>. Mark adds this<br>
 to "the city." In the fields and in the city as the excited men<br>
 ran they told the tale of the destruction of the hogs. They came<br>
 to see <b><i>(\&#275;lthon idein\)</i></b>. All the city came out <b><i>(Matthew)</i></b>, they<br>
 went out to see <b><i>(Luke)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:15 <B>{They come to Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\erchontai pros ton I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. Vivid<br>
 present. To Jesus as the cause of it all, "to meet Jesus" <b><i>(\eis<br>
 hupant&#275;sin I&#275;sou\, <!-#-->Mt 8:34)</i></b>. <B>{And behold}</B> <b><i>(\the&#333;rousin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present tense again. <B>{And they were afraid}</B> <b><i>(\kai ephob&#275;th&#275;san\)</i></b>.<br>
 They became afraid. Mark drops back to the ingressive aorist<br>
 tense <b><i>(passive voice)</i></b>. They had all been afraid of the man, but<br>
 there he was "sitting clothed and in his right mind,"<br>
 <b><i>(\kath&#275;menon himatismenon kai s&#333;phronounta\. Note the<br>
 participles)</i></b>. "At the feet of Jesus," Luke adds <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:35)</i></b>. For<br>
 a long time he had worn no clothes <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:17)</i></b>. Here was the<br>
 healing of the wild man and the destruction of the hogs all by<br>
 this same Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 5:17 <B>{To depart from their borders}</B> <b><i>(\apelthein apo t&#333;n hori&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Once before the people of Nazareth had driven Jesus out of the<br>
 city <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 4:16-31)</i></b>. Soon they will do it again on his return<br>
 there <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 6:1-6; Mt 13:54-58)</i></b>. Here in Decapolis pagan<br>
 influence was strong and the owners of the hogs cared more for<br>
 the loss of their property than for the healing of the wild<br>
 demoniac. In the clash between business and spiritual welfare<br>
 business came first with them as often today. All three Gospels<br>
 tell of the request for Jesus to leave. They feared the power of<br>
 Jesus and wanted no further interference with their business<br>
 affairs.<br>
 <br>
 5:18 <B>{As he was entering}</B> <b><i>(\embainontos autou\)</i></b>. The man began to<br>
 beseech him <b><i>(\parekalei\)</i></b> before it was too late.<br>
 <br>
 5:19 <B>{Go to thy house unto thy friends}</B> <b><i>(\Hupage eis ton oikon<br>
 sou pros tous sous\)</i></b>. "To thy own folks" rather than "thy<br>
 friends." Certainly no people needed the message about Christ<br>
 more than these people who were begging Jesus to leave. Jesus had<br>
 greatly blessed this man and so gave him the hardest task of all,<br>
 to go home and witness there for Christ. In Galilee Jesus had<br>
 several times forbidden the healed to tell what he had done for<br>
 them because of the undue excitement and misunderstanding. But<br>
 here it was different. There was no danger of too much enthusiasm<br>
 for Christ in this environment.<br>
 <br>
 5:20 <B>{He went his way}</B> <b><i>(\ap&#275;lthen\)</i></b>. He went off and did as Jesus<br>
 told him. He heralded <b><i>(\k&#275;russein\)</i></b> or published the story till<br>
 all over Decapolis men marvelled <b><i>(\ethaumazon\)</i></b> at what Jesus<br>
 did, kept on marvelling <b><i>(imperfect tense)</i></b>. The man had a greater<br>
 opportunity for Christ right in his home land than anywhere else.<br>
 They all knew this once wild demoniac who now was a new man in<br>
 Christ Jesus. Thousands of like cases of conversion under<br>
 Christ's power have happened in rescue missions in our cities.<br>
 <br>
 5:23 <B>{My little daughter}</B> <b><i>(\to thugatrion mou\)</i></b>. Diminutive of<br>
 \thugat&#275;r\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 9:18)</i></b>. "This little endearing touch in the use<br>
 of the diminutive is peculiar to Mark" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. "Is at the<br>
 point of death" <b><i>(\eschat&#333;s echei\)</i></b>. Has it in the last stages.<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 9:18 has: "has just died" <b><i>(\arti eteleusen\)</i></b>, Luke "she lay<br>
 a dying" <b><i>(\apethn&#275;sken\, imperfect, she was dying)</i></b>. It was a<br>
 tragic moment for Jairus. <B>{I pray thee}</B>, not in the Greek. This<br>
 ellipsis before \hina\ not uncommon, a sort of imperative use of<br>
 \hina\ and the subjunctive in the _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_,<br>
 p. 943)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:24 <B>{He went with him}</B> <b><i>(\ap&#275;lthen\)</i></b>. Aorist tense. Went off with<br>
 him promptly, but a great multitude followed him <b><i>(\&#275;kolouthei\)</i></b>,<br>
 was following, kept following <b><i>(imperfect tense)</i></b>. <B>{They thronged<br>
 him}</B> <b><i>(\sunethlibon auton\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense again. Only example<br>
 of <b><i>(here and in verse <!-#-->31)</i></b> this compound verb in the N.T.,<br>
 common in old Greek. Were pressing Jesus so that he could hardly<br>
 move because of the jam, or even to breathe <b><i>(\sunepnigon\, <!-#-->Lu<br>
 8:42)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:26 <B>{Had suffered many things of many physicians}</B> <b><i>(\polla<br>
 pathousa hupo poll&#333;n iatr&#333;n\)</i></b>. A pathetic picture of a woman with<br>
 a chronic case who had tried doctor after doctor. <B>{Had spent all<br>
 that she had}</B> <b><i>(\dapan&#275;sasa ta par' aut&#275;s panta\)</i></b>. Having spent<br>
 the all from herself, all her resources. For the idiom with<br>
 \para\ see <!-#-->Lu 10:7; Php 4:18. The tragedy of it was that she<br>
 "was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse" <b><i>(\m&#275;den<br>
 &#333;phel&#275;theisa alla m&#257;llon eis to cheiron elthousa\)</i></b>. Her money was<br>
 gone, her disease was gaining on her, her one chance came now<br>
 with Jesus. Matthew says nothing about her experience with the<br>
 doctors and <!-#-->Lu 8:43 merely says that she "had spent all her<br>
 living upon physicians and could not be healed of any," a plain<br>
 chronic case. Luke the physician neatly takes care of the<br>
 physicians. But they were not to blame. She had a disease that<br>
 they did not know how to cure. Vincent quotes a prescription for<br>
 an issue of blood as given in the Talmud which gives one a most<br>
 grateful feeling that he is not under the care of doctors of that<br>
 nature. The only parallel today is Chinese medicine of the old<br>
 sort before modern medical schools came.<br>
 <br>
 5:28 <B>{If I touch but his garments}</B> <b><i>(\Ean haps&#333;mai k'an t&#333;n<br>
 himati&#333;n autou\)</i></b>. She was timid and shy from her disease and did<br>
 not wish to attract attention. So she crept up in the crowd and<br>
 touched the hem or border of his garment <b><i>(\kraspedon\)</i></b> according<br>
 to <!-#-->Mt 9:20 and <!-#-->Lu 8:44.<br>
 <br>
 5:29 <B>{She felt in her body}</B> <b><i>(\egn&#333; t&#333;i s&#333;mati\)</i></b>. She knew, the<br>
 verb means. She said to herself, <B>{I am healed}</B> <b><i>(\i&#257;mai\)</i></b>. \I&#257;tai\<br>
 retains the perfect passive in the indirect discourse. It was a<br>
 vivid moment of joy for her. The plague <b><i>(\mastigos\)</i></b> or scourge<br>
 was a whip used in flagellations as on Paul to find out his guilt<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 22:24, cf. <!-#-->Heb 11:26)</i></b>. It is an old word that was used<br>
 for afflictions regarded as a scourge from God. See already on<br>
 &#175;Mr 3:10.<br>
 <br>
 5:30 <B>{Perceiving in himself}</B> <b><i>(\epignous en heaut&#333;i\)</i></b>. She<br>
 thought, perhaps, that the touch of Christ's garment would cure<br>
 her without his knowing it, a foolish fancy, no doubt, but one<br>
 due to her excessive timidity. Jesus felt in his own<br>
 consciousness. The Greek idiom more exactly means: "Jesus<br>
 perceiving in himself the power from him go out" <b><i>(\t&#275;n ex autou<br>
 dunamin exelthousan\)</i></b>. The aorist participle here is punctiliar<br>
 simply and timeless and can be illustrated by <!-#-->Lu 10:18: "I was<br>
 beholding Satan fall" <b><i>(\ethe&#333;roun ton Satan&#257;n pesonta\)</i></b>, where<br>
 \pesonta\ does not mean _fallen_ <b><i>(\pept&#333;kota\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Re 9:1 nor<br>
 falling <b><i>(\piptonta\)</i></b> but simply the constative aorist <B>{fall}</B><br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 684)</i></b>. So here Jesus means to say: "I<br>
 felt in myself the power from me go." Scholars argue whether in<br>
 this instance Jesus healed the woman by conscious will or by<br>
 unconscious response to her appeal. Some even argue that the<br>
 actual healing took place after Jesus became aware of the woman's<br>
 reaching for help by touching his garment. What we do know is<br>
 that Jesus was conscious of the going out of power from himself.<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 8:46 uses \egn&#333;n\ <b><i>(personal knowledge)</i></b>, but Mark has<br>
 \epignous\ <b><i>(personal and additional, clear knowledge)</i></b>. One may<br>
 remark that no real good can be done without the outgoing of<br>
 power. That is true of mother, preacher, teacher, doctor. <B>{Who<br>
 touched my garments?}</B> <b><i>(\Tis mou h&#275;psato t&#333;n himati&#333;n;\)</i></b>. More<br>
 exactly, <B>{Who touched me on my clothes}</B>; The Greek verb uses two<br>
 genitives, of the person and the thing. It was a dramatic moment<br>
 for Jesus and for the timid woman. Later it was a common practice<br>
 for the crowds to touch the hem of Christ's garments and be<br>
 healed <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 6:56)</i></b>. But here Jesus chose to single out this case<br>
 for examination. There was no magic in the garments of Jesus.<br>
 Perhaps there was superstition in the woman's mind, but Jesus<br>
 honoured her darkened faith as in the case of Peter's shadow and<br>
 Paul's handkerchief.<br>
 <br>
 5:31 <B>{Thronging thee}</B> <b><i>(\sunthlibonta se\)</i></b>. See verse <!-#-->24. The<br>
 disciples were amazed at the sensitiveness of Jesus to the touch<br>
 of the crowd. They little understood the drain on Jesus from all<br>
 this healing that pulled at his heart-strings and exhausted his<br>
 nervous energy even though the Son of God. He had the utmost<br>
 human sympathy.<br>
 <br>
 5:32 <B>{And he looked round about}</B> <b><i>(\kai perieblepeto\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 middle indicative. He kept looking around to find out. The answer<br>
 of Jesus to the protest of the disciples was this scrutinizing<br>
 gaze <b><i>(see already <!-#-->3:5,34)</i></b>. Jesus knew the difference between<br>
 touch and touch <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:33 <B>{Fearing and trembling, knowing}</B> <b><i>(\phob&#275;theisa kai tremousa,<br>
 eiduia\)</i></b>. These participles vividly portray this woman who had<br>
 tried to hide in the crowd. She had heard Christ's question and<br>
 felt his gaze. She had to come and confess, for something "has<br>
 happened" <b><i>(\gegonen\, second perfect active indicative, still<br>
 true)</i></b> to her. <B>{Fell down before him}</B> <b><i>(\prosepesen aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. That<br>
 was the only proper attitude now. <B>{All the truth}</B> <b><i>(\p&#257;san t&#275;n<br>
 al&#275;theian\)</i></b>. Secrecy was no longer possible. She told "the<br>
 pitiful tale of chronic misery" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:34 <B>{Go in peace}</B> <b><i>(\Hupage eis eir&#275;n&#275;n\)</i></b>. She found sympathy,<br>
 healing, and pardon for her sins, apparently. Peace here may have<br>
 more the idea of the Hebrew _shal&#333;m_, health of body and soul. So<br>
 Jesus adds: "Be whole of thy plague" <b><i>(\isthi hugi&#275;s apo t&#275;s<br>
 mastigos sou\)</i></b>. Continue whole and well.<br>
 <br>
 5:35 <B>{While he yet spake}</B> <b><i>(\Eti autou lalountos\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute. Another vivid touch in Mark and <!-#-->Lu 8:49. The phrase<br>
 is in <!-#-->Ge 29:9. Nowhere does Mark preserve better the lifelike<br>
 traits of an eyewitness like Peter than in these incidents in<br>
 chapter 5. The arrival of the messengers from Jairus was<br>
 opportune for the woman just healed of the issue of blood <b><i>(\en<br>
 husei haimatos\)</i></b> for it diverted attention from her. Now the<br>
 ruler's daughter has died <b><i>(\apethane\)</i></b>. <B>{Why troublest thou the<br>
 master any further?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti eti skulleis ton didaskalon;\)</i></b>. It was<br>
 all over, so they felt. Jesus had raised from the dead the son of<br>
 the widow of Nain <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 7:11-17)</i></b>, but people in general did not<br>
 expect him to raise the dead. The word \skull&#333;\, from \skulon\<br>
 <b><i>(_skin, pelt, spoils_)</i></b>, means to skin, to flay, in Aeschylus.<br>
 Then it comes to mean to vex, annoy, distress as in <!-#-->Mt 9:36,<br>
 which see. The middle is common in the papyri for bother, worry,<br>
 as in <!-#-->Lu 7:6. There was no further use in troubling the Teacher<br>
 about the girl.<br>
 <br>
 5:36 <B>{Not heeding}</B> <b><i>(\parakousas\)</i></b>. This is the sense in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 18:17 and uniformly so in the LXX. But here the other sense of<br>
 hearing aside, overhearing what was not spoken directly to him,<br>
 probably exists also. "Jesus might overhear what was said and<br>
 disregard its import" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Certainly he ignored the<br>
 conclusion of the messengers. The present participle \laloumenon\<br>
 suits best the idea of overhearing. Both Mark and <!-#-->Lu 8:50 have<br>
 "Fear not, only believe" <b><i>(\m&#275; phobou, monon pisteue\)</i></b>. This to<br>
 the ruler of the synagogue <b><i>(\t&#333;i archisunag&#333;g&#333;i\)</i></b> who had<br>
 remained and to whom the messenger had spoken.<br>
 <br>
 5:37 <B>{Save Peter, and James, and John}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275; Petron kai lak&#333;bon<br>
 kai I&#333;an&#275;n\)</i></b>. Probably the house was too small for the other<br>
 disciples to come in with the family. The first instance of this<br>
 inner circle of three seen again on the Mount of Transfiguration<br>
 and in the Garden of Gethsemane. The one article in the Greek<br>
 treats the group as a unit.<br>
 <br>
 5:38 <B>{Wailing greatly}</B> <b><i>(\alalazontas polla\)</i></b>. An onomatopoetic<br>
 word from Pindar down. The soldiers on entering battle cried<br>
 \Al&#257;la\. Used of clanging cymbals <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 13:1)</i></b>. Like \ololuz&#333;\ in<br>
 <!-#-->Jas 5:1. It is used here of the monotonous wail of the hired<br>
 mourners.<br>
 <br>
 5:39 <B>{Make a tumult}</B> <b><i>(\thorubeisthe\)</i></b>. Middle voice. Jesus had<br>
 dismissed one crowd <b><i>(verse <!-#-->37)</i></b>, but finds the house occupied by<br>
 the hired mourners making bedlam <b><i>(\thorubos\)</i></b> as if that showed<br>
 grief with their ostentatious noise. <!-#-->Mt 9:23 spoke of<br>
 flute-players <b><i>(\aul&#275;tas\)</i></b> and the hubbub of the excited throng<br>
 <b><i>(\thoruboumenon\. Cf. <!-#-->Mr 14:2; Ac 20:1,21,34)</i></b>. Mark, Matthew,<br>
 and Luke all quote Jesus as saying that "the child is not dead,<br>
 but sleepeth." Jesus undoubtedly meant that she was not dead to<br>
 stay dead, though some hold that the child was not really dead.<br>
 It is a beautiful word <b><i>(she is <B>{sleeping}</B>, \katheudei\)</i></b> that<br>
 Jesus uses of death.<br>
 <br>
 5:40 <B>{And they laughed him to scorn}</B> <b><i>(\kai kategel&#333;n\)</i></b>. "They<br>
 jeered at him" <b><i>(Weymouth)</i></b>. Note imperfect tense. They kept it up.<br>
 And note also \kat-\ <b><i>(perfective use)</i></b>. Exactly the same words in<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 9:24 and <!-#-->Lu 8:53. The loud laughter was ill suited to the<br>
 solemn occasion. But Jesus on his part <b><i>(\autos de\)</i></b> took charge<br>
 of the situation. <B>{Taketh the father of the child and her mother<br>
 and them that were with him}</B> <b><i>(\paralambanei ton patera tou<br>
 paidiou kai t&#275;n m&#275;tera kai tous met' autou\)</i></b>. Having put out<br>
 <b><i>(\ekbal&#333;n\)</i></b> the rest by a stern assertion of authority as if he<br>
 were master of the house, Jesus takes along with him these five<br>
 and enters the chamber of death "where the child was" <b><i>(\hopou &#275;n<br>
 to paidion\)</i></b>. He had to use pressure to make the hired mourners<br>
 leave. The presence of some people will ruin the atmosphere for<br>
 spiritual work.<br>
 <br>
 5:41 <B>{Talitha cumi}</B>. These precious Aramaic words, spoken by<br>
 Jesus to the child, Peter heard and remembered so that Mark gives<br>
 them to us. Mark interprets the simple words into Greek for those<br>
 who did not know Aramaic <b><i>(\to korasion, egeire\)</i></b>, that is,<br>
 <B>{Damsel, arise}</B>. Mark uses the diminutive \korasi&#333;n\, a little<br>
 girl, from \kor&#275;\, girl. _Braid Scots_ has it: "Lassie, wauken."<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 8:5-9 has it \H&#275; pais, egeire\, <B>{Maiden, arise}</B>. All three<br>
 Gospels mention the fact that Jesus took her by the hand, a touch<br>
 of life <b><i>(\krat&#275;sas t&#275;s cheiros\)</i></b>, giving confidence and help.<br>
 <br>
 5:42 <B>{Rose up, and walked}</B> <b><i>(\anest&#275; kai periepatei\)</i></b>. Aorist<br>
 tense <b><i>(single act)</i></b> followed by the imperfect <b><i>(<B>{the walking went<br>
 on}</B>)</i></b>. <B>{For she was twelve years old}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n gar et&#333;n d&#333;deka\)</i></b>. The<br>
 age mentioned by Mark alone and here as explanation that she was<br>
 old enough to walk. <B>{Amazed}</B> <b><i>(\exest&#275;san\)</i></b>. We have had this word<br>
 before in <!-#-->Mt 12:23 and <!-#-->Mr 2:12, which see. Here the word is<br>
 repeated in the substantive in the associative instrumental case<br>
 <b><i>(\ekstasei megal&#275;i\)</i></b>, with a great ecstasy, especially on the<br>
 part of the parents <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:56)</i></b>, and no wonder.<br>
 <br>
 5:43 <B>{That no one should know this}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275;deis gnoi touto\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist active subjunctive, \gnoi\. But would they keep<br>
 still about it? There was the girl besides. Both Mark and Luke<br>
 note that Jesus ordered that food be given to the child <B>{given<br>
 her to eat}</B>, <b><i>(\doth&#275;nai aut&#275;i phagein\)</i></b>, a natural care of the<br>
 Great Physician. Two infinitives here <b><i>(first aorist passive and<br>
 second aorist active)</i></b>. "She could walk and eat; not only alive,<br>
 but well" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
