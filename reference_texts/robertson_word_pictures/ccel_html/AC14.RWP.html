<p>14:1 <B>{They entered together}</B> <b><i>(\kata to auto eiselthein\)</i></b>. Like<br>
 \epi to auto\ in <!-#-->3:1. The infinitive \eiselthein\ is the<br>
 subject of \egeneto\. <B>{So spake that}</B> <b><i>(\lal&#275;sai hout&#333;s h&#333;ste\)</i></b>.<br>
 Infinitive again parallel to \eiselthein\. With the result that,<br>
 actual result here stated with \h&#333;ste\ and the aorist infinitive<br>
 \pisteusai\ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 999f.)</i></b> rather than \h&#333;ste\<br>
 and the indicative like <!-#-->Joh 3:16. It was a tremendous first<br>
 meeting.<br>
 <br>
 14:2 <B>{That were disobedient}</B> <b><i>(\hoi apeith&#275;santes\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active articular participle, not the present \apeithountes\ as<br>
 the Textus Receptus has it. But the meaning is probably the Jews<br>
 that disbelieved, rather than that disobeyed. Strictly \apeithe&#333;\<br>
 does mean to disobey and \apiste&#333;\ to disbelieve, but that<br>
 distinction is not observed in <!-#-->Joh 3:36 nor in <!-#-->Ac 19:9;<br>
 28:24. The word \apeithe&#333;\ means to be \apeith&#275;s\, to be<br>
 unwilling to be persuaded or to withhold belief and then also to<br>
 withhold obedience. The two meanings run into one another. To<br>
 disbelieve the word of God is to disobey God. <B>{Made them evil<br>
 affected}</B> <b><i>(\ekak&#333;san\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of<br>
 \kako&#333;\, old verb from \kakos\, to do evil to, to ill-treat, then<br>
 in later Greek as here to embitter, to exasperate as in <!-#-->Ps<br>
 105:32 and in Josephus. In this sense only here in the N.T.<br>
 Evidently Paul preached the same message as in Antioch for it won<br>
 both Jews and Gentiles, and displeased the rabbis. Codex Bezae<br>
 adds here that "the chiefs of the synagogue and the rulers"<br>
 brought persecution upon Paul and Barnabas just as was argued<br>
 about Antioch. Outside the synagogue the Jews would poison the<br>
 minds of the Gentiles against Paul and Barnabas. "The story of<br>
 Thecla suggests a means, and perhaps the apostles were brought<br>
 before the magistrates on some charge of interference with family<br>
 life. The magistrates however must have seen at once that there<br>
 was no legal case against them; and by a sentence of acquittal or<br>
 in some other way the Lord gave peace" <b><i>(Rackham)</i></b>. As we have it,<br>
 the story of Paul and Thecla undoubtedly has apocryphal features,<br>
 though Thecla may very well be an historical character here at<br>
 Iconium where the story is located. Certainly the picture of Paul<br>
 herein drawn cannot be considered authentic though a true<br>
 tradition may underlie it: "bald, bowlegged, strongly built,<br>
 small in stature, with large eyes and meeting eyebrows and<br>
 longish nose; full of grace; sometimes looking like a man,<br>
 sometimes having the face of an angel."<br>
 <br>
 14:3 <B>{Long time therefore}</B> <b><i>(\hikanon men oun chronon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Accusative of duration of time <b><i>(possibly six months)</i></b> and note<br>
 \men oun\. There is an antithesis in \eschisth&#275; de\ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->4)</i></b><br>
 and in verse <!-#-->5 <b><i>(\egeneto de\)</i></b>. After the persecution and<br>
 vindication there was a season of great opportunity which Paul<br>
 and Barnabas used to the full, "speaking boldly"<br>
 <b><i>(\parr&#275;siazomenoi\ as in <!-#-->13:46 at Antioch in Pisidia, "in the<br>
 Lord" (\epi t&#333;i kuri&#333;i\)</i></b>, upon the basis of the Lord Jesus as in<br>
 <!-#-->4:17f. And the Lord Jesus "bore witness to the word of his<br>
 grace" as he always does, "granting signs and wonders to be done<br>
 by their hands" <b><i>(\didonti s&#275;meia kai terata ginesthai dia t&#333;n<br>
 cheir&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present participle <b><i>(\didonti\)</i></b> and present<br>
 infinitive <b><i>(\ginesthai\)</i></b> repetition of both signs and wonders<br>
 <b><i>(note both words)</i></b> just as had happened with Peter and John and<br>
 the other apostles <b><i>(<!-#-->2:43; 4:29f.; 5:12; cf. <!-#-->Heb 2:4)</i></b>. The<br>
 time of peace could not last forever with such a work of grace as<br>
 this. A second explosion of persecution was bound to come and<br>
 some of the MSS. actually have \ek deuterou\ <b><i>(a second time)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:4 <B>{But the multitude of the city was divided}</B> <b><i>(\eschisth&#275; de<br>
 to pl&#275;thos t&#275;s pole&#333;s\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of<br>
 \schiz&#333;\, old verb to split, to make a schism or factions as<br>
 Sadducees and Pharisees <b><i>(<!-#-->23:7)</i></b>. This division was within the<br>
 Gentile populace. Part held <b><i>(\hoi men &#275;san\)</i></b>, literally "some<br>
 were with the Jews" <b><i>(\sun tois Ioudaiois\)</i></b>, part with the<br>
 apostles <b><i>(\hoi de sun tois apostolois\)</i></b>. Common demonstrative of<br>
 contrast <b><i>(\hoi men, hoi de\, Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 694)</i></b>. The<br>
 Jewish leaders made some impression on the Gentiles as at Antioch<br>
 in Pisidia and later at Thessalonica <b><i>(<!-#-->17:4f.)</i></b>. This is the<br>
 first time in the Acts that Paul and Barnabas are termed<br>
 "apostles" <b><i>(see also verse <!-#-->14)</i></b>. Elsewhere in the Acts the word<br>
 is restricted to the twelve. Certainly Luke does not here employ<br>
 it in that technical sense. To have followed Jesus in his<br>
 ministry and to have seen the Risen Christ was essential to the<br>
 technical use <b><i>(<!-#-->1:22f.)</i></b>. Whether Barnabas had seen the Risen<br>
 Christ we do not know, but certainly Paul had <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 9:1f.;<br>
 15:8)</i></b>. Paul claimed to be an apostle on a par with the twelve<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 1:1,16-18)</i></b>. The word originally means simply one sent <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 13:16)</i></b> like messengers of the churches with the collection <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co<br>
 8:23)</i></b>. The Jews used it of those sent from Jerusalem to collect<br>
 the temple tribute. Paul applies the word to James the Lord's<br>
 brother <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 1:19)</i></b>, to Epaphroditus <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 2:25)</i></b> as the<br>
 messenger of the church in Philippi, to Silvanus and Timothy<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 2:6; Ac 18:5)</i></b>, apparently to Apollos <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 4:9)</i></b>, and to<br>
 Andronicus and Junias <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 16:6f.)</i></b>. He even calls the Judaizers<br>
 "false apostles" <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:13)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:5 <B>{An onset}</B> <b><i>(\horm&#275;\)</i></b>. A rush or impulse as in <!-#-->Jas 3:4. Old<br>
 word, but only twice in the N.T. <b><i>(here and James)</i></b>. It probably<br>
 denotes not an actual attack so much as the open start, the<br>
 co-operation of both Jews and Gentiles <b><i>(the disaffected portion)</i></b>,<br>
 "with their rulers" <b><i>(\sun tois archousin aut&#333;n\)</i></b>, that is the<br>
 rulers of the Jewish synagogue <b><i>(<!-#-->13:27)</i></b>. The city officials<br>
 would hardly join in a mob like this, though Hackett and Rackham<br>
 think that the city magistrates were also involved as in Antioch<br>
 in Pisidia <b><i>(<!-#-->13:50)</i></b>. <B>{To entreat them shamefully}</B> <b><i>(\hubrisai\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active infinitive of \hubriz&#333;\, old verb to insult<br>
 insolently. See on &#175;Mt 22:6; Lu 18:32. <B>{To stone}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\lithobol&#275;sai\)</i></b>. First aorist active infinitive of \lithobole&#333;\,<br>
 late verb from \lithobolos\ <b><i>(\lithos\, stone, \ball&#333;\, to throw)</i></b><br>
 to pelt with stones, the verb used of the stoning of Stephen<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->7:58)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 21:35. The plan to stone them shows that<br>
 the Jews were in the lead and followed by the Gentile rabble.<br>
 "Legal proceedings having failed the only resource left for the<br>
 Jews was illegal violence" <b><i>(Rackham)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:6 <B>{They became aware of it}</B> <b><i>(\sunidontes\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active participle of \sunora&#333;\ <b><i>(\suneidon\)</i></b>, old<br>
 word to see together, to become conscious of as already in<br>
 <!-#-->12:12. In the N.T. only by Luke and Paul. <B>{Fled}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katephugon\)</i></b>. Second aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b> active indicative of<br>
 \katapheug&#333;\, old verb, but in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Heb 6:18.<br>
 Paul and Barnabas had no idea of remaining to be stoned <b><i>(lynched)</i></b><br>
 by this mob. It is a wise preacher who always knows when to stand<br>
 his ground and when to leave for the glory of God. Paul and<br>
 Barnabas were following the directions of the Lord Jesus given to<br>
 the twelve on their special tour of Galilee <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:23)</i></b>. Lystra<br>
 and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia <b><i>(still part of the Province of<br>
 Galatia, though in another _Regio_)</i></b>, not far from the base of the<br>
 Black Mountain. Professor Sterrett has apparently identified<br>
 Lystra by an inscription about six hours <b><i>(18 miles)</i></b><br>
 south-southwest from Iconium near the village Khatyn Serai and<br>
 Derbe probably near the village Losta or Zosta though its<br>
 location is really not known. Lystra had been made a colony in<br>
 B.C. 6 and Derbe was the frontier city of the Roman empire in the<br>
 southeast. These are the only cities mentioned, but they were of<br>
 importance and show that Paul kept to his plan of going to<br>
 centres of influence. The new imperial road from Antioch and<br>
 Iconium reached these cities. <B>{The region round about}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n<br>
 perich&#333;ron\)</i></b> was "a high table land, ill-watered, bleak, but<br>
 suited for sheep pasture" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:7 <B>{And there they preached the gospel}</B> <b><i>(\kakei euaggelizomenoi<br>
 &#275;san\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect middle. We are to think of<br>
 extensive evangelistic work perhaps with the assistance of<br>
 disciples from Antioch and Iconium since Paul and Barnabas could<br>
 not speak Lycaonian. \Kakei\ is crasis for \kai ekei\.<br>
 <br>
 14:8 <B>{At Lystra}</B> <b><i>(\en Lustrois\)</i></b>. Neuter plural as in <!-#-->16:2; 2Ti<br>
 3:11 while feminine singular in <!-#-->14:6,21; 16:1. There was<br>
 apparently no synagogue in Lystra and so not many Jews. Paul and<br>
 Barnabas had to do open-air preaching and probably had difficulty<br>
 in being understood by the natives though both Greek and Latin<br>
 inscriptions were discovered here by Professor Sterrett in 1885.<br>
 The incident narrated here <b><i>(verses <!-#-->8-18)</i></b> shows how they got a<br>
 real hearing among these rude heathen. <B>{There sat}</B> <b><i>(\ekath&#275;to\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect middle of \kath&#275;mai\. Was sitting. This case is very<br>
 much like that in <!-#-->3:1-11, healed by Peter. Possibly outside the<br>
 gate <b><i>(verse <!-#-->13)</i></b> or some public place. <B>{Impotent in his feet}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\adunatos tois posin\)</i></b>. Old verbal, but only here in the N.T. in<br>
 this sense except figuratively in <!-#-->Ro 15:1. Elsewhere it means<br>
 "impossible" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 19:26)</i></b>. Locative case. Common in medical<br>
 writers in the sense of "impotent." So Tobit 2:10; 5:9. <B>{Had<br>
 walked}</B> <b><i>(\periepat&#275;sen\)</i></b>. So best MSS., first aorist active<br>
 indicative "walked," not \periepepat&#275;kei\, "had walked" <b><i>(past<br>
 perfect active)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:9 <B>{The same}</B> <b><i>(\houtos\)</i></b>. Just "this one." <B>{Heard}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kouen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active, was listening to Paul speaking <b><i>(\lalountos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Either at the gate or in the market place <b><i>(<!-#-->17:17)</i></b> Paul was<br>
 preaching to such as would listen or could understand his Greek<br>
 <b><i>(_Koin&#275;_)</i></b>. Ramsay <b><i>(_St. Paul the Traveller_, pp. 114, 116)</i></b> thinks<br>
 that the cripple was a proselyte. At any rate he may have heard<br>
 of the miracles wrought at Iconium <b><i>(verse <!-#-->3)</i></b> and Paul may have<br>
 spoken of the work of healing wrought by Jesus. This man was "no<br>
 mendicant pretender," for his history was known from his birth.<br>
 <B>{Fastening his eyes upon him}</B> <b><i>(\atenisas aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Just as in<br>
 <!-#-->13:9 of Paul and <!-#-->1:10 which see. Paul saw a new hope in the<br>
 man's eyes and face. <B>{He had faith}</B> <b><i>(\echei pistin\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 active indicative retained in indirect discourse. <B>{To be made<br>
 whole}</B> <b><i>(\tou s&#333;th&#275;nai\)</i></b>. Genitive of articular first aorist<br>
 passive infinitive <b><i>(purpose and result combined)</i></b> of \s&#333;z&#333;\, to<br>
 make sound and also to save. Here clearly to make whole or well<br>
 as in <!-#-->Lu 7:50 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ac 3:16; 4:10)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:10 <B>{Upright}</B> <b><i>(\orthos\)</i></b>. Predicate adjective. In this sense<br>
 Galen and Hippocrates frequently use \orthos\ <b><i>(erect, straight)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul spoke in a loud <b><i>(\megal&#275;i\)</i></b> voice so that all could hear and<br>
 know. <B>{He leaped up and walked}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;lato kai periepatei\)</i></b>.<br>
 Rather, He leaped up with a single bound and began to walk. The<br>
 second aorist middle indicative <b><i>(with first aorist vowel \a\)</i></b> of<br>
 \hallomai\ <b><i>(late verb, in papyri)</i></b> and inchoative imperfect active<br>
 of \peripate&#333;\, common verb to walk around. This graphic picture<br>
 is concealed by the usual English rendering. It is possible that<br>
 Luke obtained the vivid report of this incident from Timothy who<br>
 may have witnessed it and who was probably converted during<br>
 Paul's stay here <b><i>(<!-#-->16:3)</i></b>. His father was a prominent Greek and<br>
 his mother Eunice, possibly a widow, may have lived here with her<br>
 mother Lois <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 1:5)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:11 <B>{Lifted up their voice}</B> <b><i>(\ep&#275;ran t&#275;n ph&#333;n&#275;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active of \epair&#333;\. In their excitement they elevated<br>
 their voices. <B>{In the speech of Lycaonia}</B> <b><i>(\Lukaonisti\)</i></b>. Adverb<br>
 from verb \lukaoniz&#333;\, to use the language of Lycaonia found here<br>
 alone, but formed regularly like \Ebraisti\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 5:2)</i></b>,<br>
 \Hell&#275;nisti\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 21:37)</i></b>, \R&#333;maisti\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:20)</i></b>. Paul was<br>
 speaking in Greek, of course, but the excitement of the crowd<br>
 over the miracle made them cry out in their native tongue which<br>
 Paul and Barnabas did not understand. Hence it was not till<br>
 preparations for offering sacrifice to them had begun that Paul<br>
 understood the new role in which he and Barnabas were held. <B>{In<br>
 the likeness of men}</B> <b><i>(\homoi&#333;thentes anthr&#333;pois\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive participle of \homoi&#333;\, to liken, with the associative<br>
 instrumental case. In this primitive state the people hold to the<br>
 old Graeco-Roman mythology. The story of Baucis and Philemon<br>
 tells how Jupiter <b><i>(Zeus)</i></b> and Mercury <b><i>(Hermes)</i></b> visited in human<br>
 form the neighbouring region of Phrygia <b><i>(Ovid, _Meta_. VIII.<br>
 626)</i></b>. Jupiter <b><i>(Zeus)</i></b> had a temple in Lystra.<br>
 <br>
 14:12 <B>{They called}</B> <b><i>(\ekaloun\)</i></b>. Inchoative imperfect began to<br>
 call. <B>{Barnabas, Jupiter}</B> <b><i>(\ton Barnaban Dia\)</i></b>. Because Barnabas<br>
 was the older and the more imposing in appearance. Paul admits<br>
 that he was not impressive in looks <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 10:10)</i></b>. <B>{And Paul,<br>
 Mercury}</B> <b><i>(\ton de Paulon Herm&#275;n\)</i></b>. Mercury <b><i>(\Herm&#275;s\)</i></b> was the<br>
 messenger of the gods, and the spokesman of Zeus. \Herm&#275;s\ was of<br>
 beautiful appearance and eloquent in speech, the inventor of<br>
 speech in legend. Our word hermeneutics or science of<br>
 interpretation comes from this word <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 7:2; Joh 1:38)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Because he was the chief speaker}</B> <b><i>(\epeid&#275; autos &#275;n ho<br>
 h&#275;goumenos tou logou\)</i></b>. Paul was clearly "the leader of the<br>
 talk." So it seemed a clear case to the natives. If preachers<br>
 always knew what people really think of them! Whether Paul was<br>
 alluding to his experience in Lystra or not in <!-#-->Ga 4:14,<br>
 certainly they did receive him as an angel of God, as if<br>
 "Mercury" in reality.<br>
 <br>
 14:13 <B>{Whose temple was before the city}</B> <b><i>(\tou ontos pro t&#275;s<br>
 p&#333;le&#333;s\)</i></b>. The god <b><i>(Zeus)</i></b> is identified with his temple. He had a<br>
 statue and temple there. <B>{Oxen and garlands}</B> <b><i>(\taurous kai<br>
 stemmata\)</i></b>. Probably garlands to put on the oxen before they were<br>
 slain. It was common to sacrifice bullocks to Jupiter and<br>
 Mercury. <B>{Would have done sacrifice}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;thelen thuein\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect indicative, wanted to offer sacrifice. He was planning<br>
 to do it, and his purpose now became plain to Paul and Barnabas.<br>
 <br>
 14:14 <B>{Having heard}</B> <b><i>(\akousantes\)</i></b>. Such elaborate preparation<br>
 "with the multitudes" <b><i>(\sun tois ochlois\)</i></b> spread rumours and<br>
 some who spoke Greek told Paul and Barnabas. It is possible that<br>
 the priest of Jupiter may have sent a formal request that the<br>
 visiting "gods" might come out to the statue by the temple gates<br>
 to make it a grand occasion. They rent their garments<br>
 <b><i>(\diarr&#275;xantes\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle from<br>
 \diarr&#275;gnumi\, old verb to rend in two. Like the high priest in<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 26:65 as if an act of sacrilege was about to be committed.<br>
 It was strange conduct for the supposed gods! <B>{Sprang forth}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\exep&#275;d&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active indicative of<br>
 \ekp&#275;da&#333;\ <b><i>(note \ek\)</i></b>, old verb, here only in the N.T. It was all<br>
 a sign of grief and horror with loud outcries <b><i>(\krazontes\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:15 <B>{Sirs}</B> <b><i>(\andres\)</i></b>. Literally, Men. Abrupt, but courteous.<br>
 <B>{We also are men of like passions with you}</B> <b><i>(\kai h&#275;meis<br>
 homoiopatheis esmen humin anthr&#333;poi\)</i></b>. Old adjective from<br>
 \homoios\ <b><i>(like)</i></b> and \pasch&#333;\, to experience. In the N.T. only<br>
 here and <!-#-->Jas 5:17. It means "of like nature" more exactly and<br>
 affected by like sensations, not "gods" at all. Their conduct was<br>
 more serious than the obeisance of Cornelius to Peter<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->10:25f.)</i></b>. \Humin\ is associative instrumental case. <B>{And bring<br>
 you good tidings}</B> <b><i>(\euaggelizomenoi\)</i></b>. No "and" in the Greek,<br>
 just the present middle participle, "gospelizing you." They are<br>
 not gods, but evangelists. Here we have Paul's message to a pagan<br>
 audience without the Jewish environment and he makes the same<br>
 line of argument seen in <!-#-->Ac 17:21-32; Ro 1:18-23. At Antioch in<br>
 Pisidia we saw Paul's line of approach to Jews and proselytes<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 13:16-41)</i></b>. <B>{That ye should turn from these vain things}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\apo tout&#333;n t&#333;n matai&#333;n epistrephein\)</i></b>. He boldly calls the<br>
 worship of Jupiter and Mercury and all idols "vain" or empty<br>
 things, pointing to the statues and the temple. <B>{Unto the living<br>
 God}</B> <b><i>(\epi theon z&#333;nta\)</i></b>. They must go the whole way. Our God is<br>
 a live God, not a dead statue. Paul is fond of this phrase <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co<br>
 6:16; Ro 9:26)</i></b>. <B>{Who made}</B> <b><i>(\hos epoi&#275;sen\)</i></b>. The one God is<br>
 alive and is the Creator of the Universe just as Paul will argue<br>
 in Athens <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 17:24)</i></b>. Paul here quotes <!-#-->Ps 146:6 and has <!-#-->Ge<br>
 1:1 in mind. See also <!-#-->1Th 1:9 where a new allegiance is also<br>
 claimed as here.<br>
 <br>
 14:16 <B>{In the generations gone by}</B> <b><i>(\en tais par&#333;ich&#275;menais<br>
 geneais\)</i></b>. Perfect middle participle from \paroichomai\, to go<br>
 by, old verb, here alone in the N.T. <B>{Suffered}</B> <b><i>(\eiasen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Constative aorist active indicative of \ea&#333;\ <b><i>(note syllabic<br>
 augment)</i></b>. Paul here touches God in history as he did just before<br>
 in creation. God's hand is on the history of all the nations<br>
 <b><i>(Gentile and Jew)</i></b>, only with the Gentiles he withdrew the<br>
 restraints of his grace in large measure <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 17:30; Ro<br>
 1:24,26,28)</i></b>, judgment enough for their sins. <B>{To walk in their<br>
 ways}</B> <b><i>(\poreuesthai tais hodois aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 infinitive, to go on walking, with locative case without \en\.<br>
 This philosophy of history does not mean that God was ignorant or<br>
 unconcerned. He was biding his time in patience.<br>
 <br>
 14:17 <B>{And yet}</B> <b><i>(\kaitoi\)</i></b>. Old Greek compound particle <b><i>(\kai<br>
 toi\)</i></b>. In the N.T. twice only, once with finite verb as here,<br>
 once with the participle <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 4:3)</i></b>. <B>{Without witness}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\amarturon\)</i></b>. Old adjective <b><i>(\a\ privative and \martus\,<br>
 witness)</i></b>, only here in the N.T. <B>{Left}</B> <b><i>(\aph&#275;ken\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active <b><i>(\k\ aorist indicative of \aphi&#275;mi\)</i></b>. <B>{In that he did<br>
 good}</B> <b><i>(\agathourg&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present active causal participle of<br>
 \agathourge&#333;\, late and rare verb <b><i>(also \agathoerge&#333;\ <!-#-->1Ti<br>
 6:18)</i></b>, reading of the oldest MSS. here for \agathopoie&#333;\, to do<br>
 good. Note two other causal participles here parallel with<br>
 \agathourg&#333;n\, viz., \didous\ <b><i>("giving you")</i></b> present active of<br>
 \did&#333;mi, empipl&#333;n\ <b><i>("filling")</i></b> present active of \empimpla&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(late form of \empimpl&#275;mi\)</i></b>. This witness to God <b><i>(his doing good,<br>
 giving rains and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food<br>
 and gladness)</i></b> they could receive without the help of the Old<br>
 Testament revelation <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:20)</i></b>. Zeus was regarded as the god of<br>
 rain <b><i>(Jupiter Pluvius)</i></b> and Paul claims the rain and the fruitful<br>
 <b><i>(\karpophorous, karpos\, and \pher&#333;\, fruit bearing, old word,<br>
 here alone in N.T.)</i></b> seasons as coming from God. Lycaonia was<br>
 often dry and it would be an appropriate item. "Mercury, as the<br>
 God of merchandise, was also the dispenser of food" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul does not talk about laws of nature as if they governed<br>
 themselves, but he sees the living God "behind the drama of the<br>
 physical world" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. These simple country people could<br>
 grasp his ideas as he claims everything for the one true God.<br>
 <B>{Gladness}</B> <b><i>(\euphrosun&#275;s\)</i></b>. Old word from \euphr&#333;n\ <b><i>(\eu\ and<br>
 \phr&#275;n\)</i></b>, good cheer. In the N.T. only <!-#-->Ac 2:28 and here.<br>
 Cheerfulness should be our normal attitude when we consider God's<br>
 goodness. Paul does not here mention Christ because he had the<br>
 single definite purpose to dissuade them from worshipping<br>
 Barnabas and himself.<br>
 <br>
 14:18 <B>{Scarce}</B> <b><i>(\molis\)</i></b>. Adverb in same sense as old \mogis\,<br>
 from \molos\, toil. <B>{Restrained}</B> <b><i>(\katepausan\)</i></b>. Effective first<br>
 aorist active indicative of \katapau&#333;\, old verb in causative<br>
 sense to make abstain from. <B>{From doing sacrifice unto them}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\tou m&#275; thuein autois\)</i></b>. Ablative case of the articular<br>
 infinitive with redundant negative after \katepausan\, regular<br>
 Greek idiom <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 1094, 1171)</i></b>. It had been a<br>
 harrowing and well-nigh a horrible ordeal, but finally Paul had<br>
 won. If only nobody else had interposed!<br>
 <br>
 14:19 <B>{But there came thither Jews from Antioch and Iconium}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Ep&#275;lthan de apo Antiocheias kai Ikoniou Ioudaioi\)</i></b>. Came to or<br>
 upon them, \ep&#275;lthan\, second aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> indicative of<br>
 \eperchomai\. Whether news of the miracle had reached those<br>
 cities we do not know. These may have been travelling grain<br>
 merchants. At any rate there was an interval in which Paul and<br>
 Barnabas won some disciples <b><i>(verse <!-#-->22)</i></b>. There would be a<br>
 natural reaction, even revulsion, in the minds of many who had<br>
 come so near to worshipping Paul and Barnabas. The pendulum<br>
 swings easily from one extreme to the other. The hostile Jews<br>
 from Antioch and Iconium may even have followed Paul and Barnabas<br>
 along the fine Roman road on purpose to keep them on the run.<br>
 They had driven them out of Antioch and out of Iconium and now<br>
 appear at Lystra at an opportune moment for their work. <B>{Having<br>
 persuaded the multitudes}</B> <b><i>(\peisantes tous ochlous\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b> active participle of \peith&#333;\. They had<br>
 complete success with many and struck at the psychological<br>
 moment. <B>{They stoned Paul}</B> <b><i>(\lithasantes ton Paulon\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active participle of \lithaz&#333;\, late verb from \lithos\<br>
 for throwing stones <b><i>(used by Paul referring to this one incident<br>
 when alone he was stoned, <!-#-->2Co 11:25)</i></b>. The wounds inflicted may<br>
 have left some of the scars <b><i>(\stigmata\)</i></b> mentioned in <!-#-->Ga 6:17.<br>
 They stoned Paul as the chief speaker <b><i>(Mercury)</i></b> and passed by<br>
 Barnabas <b><i>(Jupiter)</i></b>. It was a Jewish mode of punishment as against<br>
 Stephen and these Jews knew that Paul was the man that they had<br>
 to deal with. Hackett notes that the Jews with two exceptions<br>
 incited the persecutions which Paul endured. The exceptions were<br>
 in Philippi <b><i>(<!-#-->16:16-40)</i></b> and Ephesus <b><i>(<!-#-->19:23-41)</i></b>. <B>{Dragged him<br>
 out of the city}</B> <b><i>(\esuron ex&#333; t&#275;s pole&#333;s\)</i></b>. They hurled Stephen<br>
 outside of the city before stoning him <b><i>(\7:58\)</i></b>. It was a hurried<br>
 and irregular proceeding, but they were dragging <b><i>(imperfect<br>
 active of \sur&#333;\, old verb)</i></b> Paul out now. <B>{Supposing that he were<br>
 dead}</B> <b><i>(\nomizontes auton tethn&#275;kenai\)</i></b>. Present active participle<br>
 with infinitive <b><i>(second perfect active of \thn&#275;sk&#333;\)</i></b> in indirect<br>
 discourse with accusative of general reference. The Jews are<br>
 jubilant this time with memories of Paul's escape at Antioch and<br>
 Iconium. The pagan mob feel that they have settled accounts for<br>
 their narrow escape from worshipping two Jewish renegade<br>
 preachers. It was a good day's work for them all. Luke does not<br>
 say that Paul was actually dead.<br>
 <br>
 14:20 <B>{Stood round about him}</B> <b><i>(\kukl&#333;sant&#333;n auton\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute with first aorist active participle of \kuklo&#333;\, old<br>
 verb from \kuklos\ <b><i>(circle, cycle)</i></b> to make a circle round, to<br>
 encircle. The would-be murderers left and a group of disciples<br>
 gathered round to see if Paul was dead or alive and, if dead, to<br>
 bury him. In that group Timothy may very well have been along<br>
 with Eunice and Barnabas. Timothy, a lad of about fifteen, would<br>
 not soon forget that solemn scene <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 3:11)</i></b>. But Paul suddenly<br>
 <b><i>(apparently a miraculous recovery)</i></b> rose up <b><i>(\anastas\)</i></b> and<br>
 entered the city to the surprise and joy of the disciples who<br>
 were willing to brave persecution with Paul. <B>{With Barnabas}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sun t&#333;i Barnab&#257;i\)</i></b>. With the assistance of Barnabas. It was<br>
 plainly unwise to continue in Lystra so that they set out on the<br>
 next day <b><i>(\t&#275;i epaurion\, ten times in Acts)</i></b>, shaken and bruised<br>
 as Paul was. Derbe was some forty miles distant, near the pass to<br>
 the Cilician Gates.<br>
 <br>
 14:21 <B>{When they had preached the gospel to that city}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\euaggelisamenoi t&#275;n polin ekein&#275;n\)</i></b>. Having evangelized <b><i>(first<br>
 aorist middle participle)</i></b> that city, a smaller city and<br>
 apparently with no trouble from the Jews. <B>{Had made many<br>
 disciples}</B> <b><i>(\math&#275;teusantes hikanous\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 participle of \math&#275;teu&#333;\ from \math&#275;t&#275;s\, a learner or disciple.<br>
 Late verb in Plutarch, to be a disciple <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:57 like <!-#-->Joh<br>
 19:38)</i></b> and then to disciple <b><i>(old English, Spenser)</i></b>, to make a<br>
 disciple as in <!-#-->Mt 28:19 and here. Paul and Barnabas were<br>
 literally here obeying the command of Jesus in discipling people<br>
 in this heathen city. <B>{They returned to Lystra and to Iconium,<br>
 and to Antioch}</B> <b><i>(\hupestrepsan eis t&#275;n Lustran kai eis Ikonion<br>
 kai eis Antiocheian\)</i></b>. Derbe was the frontier city of the Roman<br>
 empire. The quickest way to return to Antioch in Syria would have<br>
 been by the Cilician Gates or by the pass over Mt. Taurus by<br>
 which Paul and Silas will come to Derbe in the second tour <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 15:41-16:1)</i></b>, but difficult to travel in winter. But it was<br>
 necessary to revisit the churches in Lystra, Iconium, Antioch in<br>
 Pisidia and to see that they were able to withstand persecution.<br>
 Paul was a Roman citizen though he had not made use of this<br>
 privilege as yet for his own protection. Against mob violence it<br>
 would count for little, but he did not hesitate. Paul had been<br>
 stoned in Lystra, threatened in Iconium, expelled in Antioch. He<br>
 shows his wisdom in conserving his work.<br>
 <br>
 14:22 <B>{Confirming}</B> <b><i>(\epist&#275;rizontes\)</i></b>. Late verb <b><i>(in LXX)</i></b>, in<br>
 N.T. only in <!-#-->Ac 14:22; 15:32,41, to make more firm, to give<br>
 additional <b><i>(\epi\)</i></b> strength. Each time in Acts the word is used<br>
 concerning these churches. <B>{To continue in the faith}</B> <b><i>(\emmenein<br>
 t&#275;i pistei\)</i></b>. To remain in with locative, old verb. It is<br>
 possible that \pistis\ here has the notion of creed as Paul uses<br>
 it later <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 1:23 with \epimen&#333;\; <!-#-->1Ti 5:8)</i></b>. It seems to be<br>
 here more than trust or belief. These recent converts from<br>
 heathenism were ill-informed, were persecuted, had broken family<br>
 and social ties, greatly needed encouragement if they were to<br>
 hold out. <B>{We must}</B> <b><i>(\dei h&#275;m&#257;s\)</i></b>. It does not follow from this<br>
 use of "we" that Luke was present, since it is a general<br>
 proposition applying to all Christians at all times <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 3:12)</i></b>.<br>
 Luke, of course, approved this principle. Knowling asks why<br>
 Timothy may not have told Luke about Paul's work. It all sounds<br>
 like quotation of Paul's very language. Note the change of<br>
 construction here after \parakalountes\ <b><i>(infinitive of indirect<br>
 command, \emmenein\, but \hoti dei\, indirect assertion)</i></b>. They<br>
 needed the right understanding of persecution as we all do. Paul<br>
 frankly warned these new converts in this heathen environment of<br>
 the many tribulations through which they must enter the Kingdom<br>
 of God <b><i>(the culmination at last)</i></b> as he did at Ephesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 20:20)</i></b> and as Jesus had done <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 16:33)</i></b>. These saints were<br>
 already converted.<br>
 <br>
 14:23 <B>{And when they had appointed for them elders in every<br>
 church}</B> <b><i>(\cheiroton&#275;santes de autois kat' ekkl&#275;sian<br>
 presbuterous\)</i></b>. They needed also some form of organization,<br>
 though already churches. Note distributive use of \kata\ with<br>
 \ekkl&#275;sian\ <b><i>(<!-#-->2:46; 5:42; Tit 1:5)</i></b>. \Cheirotone&#333;\ <b><i>(from<br>
 \cheirotonos\, extending the hand, \cheir\, hand, and \tein&#333;\, to<br>
 stretch)</i></b> is an old verb that originally meant to vote by show of<br>
 the hands, finally to appoint with the approval of an assembly<br>
 that chooses as in <!-#-->2Co 8:19, and then to appoint without regard<br>
 to choice as in Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. XIII. 2, 2)</i></b> of the appointment<br>
 of Jonathan as high priest by Alexander. So in <!-#-->Ac 10:41 the<br>
 compound \procheiratone&#333;\ is used of witnesses appointed by God.<br>
 But the seven <b><i>(deacons)</i></b> were first selected by the Jerusalem<br>
 church and then appointed <b><i>(\katast&#275;somen\)</i></b> by the apostles. That<br>
 is probably the plan contemplated by Paul in his directions to<br>
 Titus <b><i>(<!-#-->Tit 1:5)</i></b> about the choice of elders. It is most likely<br>
 that this plan was the one pursued by Paul and Barnabas with<br>
 these churches. They selected the elders in each instance and<br>
 Paul and Barnabas "ordained" them as we say, though the word<br>
 \cheirotone&#333;\ does not mean that. "Elders" were mentioned first<br>
 in <!-#-->11:30. Later Paul will give the requirements expected in<br>
 these "elders" or "bishops" <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 1:1)</i></b> as in <!-#-->1Ti 3:1-7; Tit<br>
 1:5-9. It is fairly certain that these elders were chosen to<br>
 correspond in a general way with the elders in the Jewish<br>
 synagogue after which the local church was largely copied as to<br>
 organization and worship. Paul, like Jesus, constantly worshipped<br>
 and spoke in the synagogues. Already it is plain, as at Antioch<br>
 in Syria <b><i>(<!-#-->11:26)</i></b>, that the Christians can no longer count on<br>
 the use of the Jewish synagogue. They must have an organization<br>
 of their own. The use of the plural here implies what was true at<br>
 Philippi <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 1:1)</i></b> and Ephesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:17,28)</i></b> that each church<br>
 <b><i>(one in each city)</i></b> "had its college of elders" <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b> as in<br>
 Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->21:18)</i></b>. Elder <b><i>(\presbuteros\)</i></b> was the Jewish name<br>
 and bishop <b><i>(\episkopos\)</i></b> the Greek name for the same office.<br>
 "Those who are called elders in speaking of Jewish communities<br>
 are called bishops in speaking of Gentile communities" <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>.<br>
 Hovey rightly holds against Hackett that teaching was a normal<br>
 function of these elders, pastors or bishops as they were<br>
 variously called <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 3:2; Tit 1:9; 1Co 12:28,30; Eph 4:11)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Had prayed with fasting}</B> <b><i>(\proseuxamenoi meta n&#275;stei&#333;n\)</i></b>. It was<br>
 a serious matter, this formal setting apart of these "elders" in<br>
 the churches. So it was done in a public meeting with prayer and<br>
 fasting as when Paul and Barnabas were sent forth from Antioch in<br>
 Syria <b><i>(<!-#-->13:3)</i></b> on this mission tour. <B>{They commended them to the<br>
 Lord}</B> <b><i>(\parethento autous t&#333;i kuri&#333;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle<br>
 indicative of \paratith&#275;mi\. Old and solemn word, to entrust, to<br>
 deposit as in a bank <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 1:18; 2Ti 2:2)</i></b>. Cf. \parath&#275;k&#275;\ in<br>
 <!-#-->1Ti 6:20; 2Ti 1:12,14. It was all that they could now do, to<br>
 commit them to the Lord Jesus. Jesus used this word on the cross<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:32)</i></b>. <B>{On whom they had believed}</B> <b><i>(\eis hon<br>
 pepisteukeisan\)</i></b>. Past perfect indicative <b><i>(without augment)</i></b> of<br>
 \pisteu&#333;\. They had "trusted" in Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 1:12)</i></b> and Paul now<br>
 "entrusts" them to him with confidence. It was a solemn and<br>
 serious occasion in each instance as it always is to set apart<br>
 men for the ministry. These men may not have been ideal men for<br>
 this service, but they were the only ones available and they were<br>
 chosen from the actual membership in each instance, men who knew<br>
 local conditions and problems.<br>
 <br>
 14:24 <B>{When they had spoken the word in Perga}</B> <b><i>(\lal&#275;santes en<br>
 Perg&#275;i ton logon\)</i></b>. Now they stopped and preached in Perga which<br>
 they had apparently not done before <b><i>(see <!-#-->13:13f.)</i></b>. After<br>
 leaving Antioch they passed on through Pisidia, as if Antioch was<br>
 not strictly in Pisidia <b><i>(see on <!-#-->13:14)</i></b> and into Pamphylia. They<br>
 crossed from Perga to Attaleia, the port of Perga, sixteen miles<br>
 down the Cestus, and capital of Pamphylia, to find a ship for<br>
 Antioch in Syria. It is now called Adala and for long was the<br>
 chief harbour of the south coast of Asia Minor. We do not know<br>
 why they did not revisit Cyprus, perhaps because no permanent<br>
 Gentile churches were founded there.<br>
 <br>
 14:26 <B>{They sailed away to Antioch}</B> <b><i>(\apepleusan eis<br>
 Antiocheian\)</i></b>. Effective aorist active indicative of \apople&#333;\,<br>
 to sail off. They had been gone some eighteen months. <B>{They had<br>
 been committed}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san paradedomenoi\)</i></b>. Periphrastic past perfect<br>
 passive of \paradid&#333;mi\, old and common verb. High and serious<br>
 thoughts filled the hearts of these first returned missionaries<br>
 as they neared home. The grace of God had been with them. They<br>
 had fulfilled <b><i>(\epl&#275;r&#333;san\)</i></b> the work to which they had been set<br>
 apart by the Holy Spirit with the prayers of the Antioch church.<br>
 They now had a wondrous story to tell.<br>
 <br>
 14:27 <B>{Gathered the church together}</B> <b><i>(\sunagagontes t&#275;n<br>
 ekkl&#275;sian\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of \sunag&#333;\. It "was<br>
 the first missionary meeting in history" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. It was not<br>
 hard to get the church together when the news spread that Paul<br>
 and Barnabas had returned. "The suitability of the Gospel to<br>
 become the religion of the world had not before been put to the<br>
 test" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. Doubtless many "wise-acres" had predicted<br>
 failure as they did for William Carey and for Adoniram Judson and<br>
 Luther Rice. <B>{Rehearsed}</B> <b><i>(\an&#275;ggellon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. It was<br>
 a long story for they had many things to tell of God's dealings<br>
 "with them" <b><i>(\met' aut&#333;n\)</i></b> for God had been "with them" all the<br>
 while as Jesus had said he would be <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 28:20, \meth' h&#8211;m&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul could recount some of the details given later in <!-#-->2Co 11.<br>
 <B>{And how}</B> <b><i>(\kai hoti\)</i></b>. Or "and that" in particular, as the<br>
 upshot of it all. <B>{He had opened a door of faith unto the<br>
 Gentiles}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;noixen tois ethnesin thuran piste&#333;s\)</i></b>. Three times<br>
 in Paul's Epistles <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 16:9; 2Co 2:12; Col 4:3)</i></b> he employed<br>
 the metaphor of "door," perhaps a reminiscence of the very<br>
 language of Paul here. This work in Galatia gained a large place<br>
 in Paul's heart <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 4:14f.)</i></b>. The Gentiles now, it was plain,<br>
 could enter the kingdom of God <b><i>(verse <!-#-->22)</i></b> through the door of<br>
 faith, not by law or by circumcision or by heathen philosophy or<br>
 mythology.<br>
 <br>
 14:28 <B>{And they tarried no little time}</B> <b><i>(\dietribon de chronon<br>
 ouk oligon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \diatrib&#333;\, old verb to rub<br>
 hard, to consume, with accusative of extent of time. It was a<br>
 happy time of fellowship. The experiment entered upon by the<br>
 church of Antioch was now a pronounced success. It was at the<br>
 direct command of the Holy Spirit, but they had prayed for the<br>
 absent missionaries and rejoiced at their signal success. There<br>
 is no sign of jealousy on the part of Barnabas when Paul returns<br>
 as the chief hero of the expedition. A new corner has been turned<br>
 in the history of Christianity. There is a new centre of<br>
 Christian activity. What will Jerusalem think of the new<br>
 developments at Antioch? Paul and Barnabas made no report to<br>
 Jerusalem.<br>
