 <HR>
<p>11:1 <B>{Imitators of me}</B> <b><i>(\mim&#275;tai mou\)</i></b>. In the principle of<br>
 considerate love as so clearly shown in chapters <!-#-->1Co 8-10 and<br>
 in so far as <b><i>(\kath&#333;s\)</i></b> Paul is himself an imitator of Christ.<br>
 The preacher is a leader and is bound to set an example or<br>
 pattern <b><i>(\tupos\)</i></b> for others <b><i>(<!-#-->Tit 2:7)</i></b>. This verse clearly<br>
 belongs to the preceding chapter and not to chapter 11.<br>
 <br>
 11:2 <B>{Hold fast the traditions}</B> <b><i>(\tas paradoseis katechete\)</i></b>.<br>
 Hold down as in <!-#-->15:2. \Paradosis\ <b><i>(tradition)</i></b> from \paradid&#333;mi\<br>
 <b><i>(\pared&#333;ka\, first aorist active indicative)</i></b> is an old word and<br>
 merely something handed on from one to another. The thing handed<br>
 on may be bad as in <!-#-->Mt 15:2f. <b><i>(which see)</i></b> and contrary to the<br>
 will of God <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 7:8f.)</i></b> or it may be wholly good as here. There<br>
 is a constant conflict between the new and the old in science,<br>
 medicine, law, theology. The obscurantist rejects all the new and<br>
 holds to the old both true and untrue. New truth must rest upon<br>
 old truth and is in harmony with it.<br>
 <br>
 11:3 <B>{But I would have you know}</B> <b><i>(\thel&#333; de humas eidenai\)</i></b>. But<br>
 I wish you to know, censure in contrast to the praise in verse<br>
 <!-#-->2. <B>{The head of Christ is God}</B> <b><i>(\kephal&#275; tou Christou ho<br>
 theos\)</i></b>. Rather, God is the head of Christ, since \kephal&#275;\ is<br>
 anarthrous and predicate.<br>
 <br>
 11:4 <B>{Having his head covered}</B> <b><i>(\kata kephal&#275;s ech&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, having a veil <b><i>(\kalumma\ understood)</i></b> down from the<br>
 head <b><i>(\kephal&#275;s\ ablative after \kata\ as with \kata\ in <!-#-->Mr<br>
 5:13; Ac 27:14)</i></b>. It is not certain whether the Jews at this time<br>
 used the _tallith_, "a four-corned shawl having fringes<br>
 consisting of eight threads, each knotted five times" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b><br>
 as they did later. Virgil <b><i>(_Aeneid_ iii., 545)</i></b> says: "And our<br>
 heads are shrouded before the altar with a Phrygian vestment."<br>
 The Greeks <b><i>(both men and women)</i></b> remained bareheaded in public<br>
 prayer and this usage Paul commends for the men.<br>
 <br>
 11:5 <B>{With her head unveiled}</B> <b><i>(\akatakalupt&#333;i t&#275;i kephal&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Associative instrumental case of manner and the predicative<br>
 adjective <b><i>(compound adjective and feminine form same as<br>
 masculine)</i></b>, "with the head unveiled." Probably some of the women<br>
 had violated this custom. "Amongst Greeks only the \hetairai\, so<br>
 numerous in Corinth, went about unveiled; slave-women wore the<br>
 shaven head--also a punishment of the adulteress" <b><i>(Findlay)</i></b>. Cf.<br>
 <!-#-->Nu 5:18. <B>{One and the same thing as if she were shaven}</B> <b><i>(\hen<br>
 kai to auto t&#275;i exur&#275;men&#275;i\)</i></b>. Literally, "One and the same thing<br>
 with the one shaven" <b><i>(associative instrumental case again,<br>
 Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 530)</i></b>. Perfect passive articular<br>
 participle of the verb \xura&#333;\, later form for the old \xure&#333;\.<br>
 It is public praying and prophesying that the Apostle here has in<br>
 mind. He does not here condemn the act, but the breach of custom<br>
 which would bring reproach. A woman convicted of adultery had her<br>
 hair shorn <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 7:20)</i></b>. The Justinian code prescribed shaving<br>
 the head for an adulteress whom the husband refused to receive<br>
 after two years. Paul does not tell Corinthian Christian women to<br>
 put themselves on a level with courtesans.<br>
 <br>
 11:6 <B>{Let her also be shorn}</B> <b><i>(\kai keirasth&#333;\)</i></b>. Aorist middle<br>
 imperative of \keir&#333;\, to shear <b><i>(as sheep)</i></b>. Let her cut her hair<br>
 close. A single act by the woman. <B>{If it is a shame}</B> <b><i>(\ei de<br>
 aischron\)</i></b>. Condition of first class assumed to be true.<br>
 \Aischron\ is old adjective from \aischos\, bareness, disgrace.<br>
 Clearly Paul uses such strong language because of the effect on a<br>
 woman's reputation in Corinth by such conduct that proclaimed her<br>
 a lewd woman. Social custom varied in the world then as now, but<br>
 there was no alternative in Corinth. <B>{To be shorn or shaven}</B> <b><i>(\to<br>
 keirasthai kai xurasthai\)</i></b>. Articular infinitives subject of<br>
 copula \estin\ understood, \keirasthai\ first aorist middle,<br>
 \xurasthai\ present middle. Note change in tense. <B>{Let her be<br>
 veiled}</B> <b><i>(\katakaluptesth&#333;\)</i></b>. Present middle imperative of old<br>
 compound \kata-kalupt&#333;\, here alone in N.T. Let her cover up<br>
 herself with the veil <b><i>(down, \kata\, the Greek says, the veil<br>
 hanging down from the head)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:7 <B>{The image and glory of God}</B> <b><i>(\eik&#333;n kai doxa theou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Anarthrous substantives, but definite. Reference to <!-#-->Ge 1:28;<br>
 2:26 whereby man is made directly in the image <b><i>(\eik&#333;n\)</i></b> of God.<br>
 It is the moral likeness of God, not any bodily resemblance.<br>
 Ellicott notes that man is the glory <b><i>(\doxa\)</i></b> of God as the crown<br>
 of creation and as endowed with sovereignty like God himself.<br>
 <B>{The glory of the man}</B> <b><i>(\doxa andros\)</i></b>. Anarthrous also, man's<br>
 glory. In <!-#-->Ge 2:26 the LXX has \anthr&#333;pos\ <b><i>(Greek word for both<br>
 male and female)</i></b>, not \an&#275;r\ <b><i>(male)</i></b> as here. But the woman<br>
 <b><i>(\gun&#275;\)</i></b> was formed from the man <b><i>(\an&#275;r\)</i></b> and this priority of<br>
 the male <b><i>(verse <!-#-->8)</i></b> gives a certain superiority to the male. On<br>
 the other hand, it is equally logical to argue that woman is the<br>
 crown and climax of all creation, being the last.<br>
 <br>
 11:9 <B>{For the woman}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#275;n gunaika\)</i></b>. Because of <b><i>(\dia\ with<br>
 accusative case)</i></b> the woman. The record in Genesis gives the man<br>
 <b><i>(\an&#275;r\)</i></b> as the origin <b><i>(\ek\)</i></b> of the woman and the reason for<br>
 <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> the creation <b><i>(\ektisth&#275;\, first aorist passive of<br>
 \ktiz&#333;\, old verb to found, to create, to form)</i></b> of woman.<br>
 <br>
 11:10 <B>{Ought}</B> <b><i>(\opheilei\)</i></b>. Moral obligation therefore <b><i>(\dia<br>
 touto\, rests on woman in the matter of dress that does not <b><i>(\ouk<br>
 opheilei\ in verse <!-#-->7)</i></b> rest on the man.)</i></b><B>{To have a sign of<br>
 authority}</B> <b><i>(\exousian echein\)</i></b>. He means \s&#275;meion exousias\<br>
 <b><i>(symbol of authority)</i></b> by \exousian\, but it is the sign of<br>
 authority of the man over the woman. The veil on the woman's head<br>
 is the symbol of the authority that the man with the uncovered<br>
 head has over her. It is, as we see it, more a sign of subjection<br>
 <b><i>(\hypotag&#275;s\, <!-#-->1Ti 2:10)</i></b> than of authority <b><i>(\exousias\)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Because of the angels}</B> <b><i>(\dia tous aggelous\)</i></b>. This startling<br>
 phrase has caused all kinds of conjecture which may be dismissed.<br>
 It is not preachers that Paul has in mind, nor evil angels who<br>
 could be tempted <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 6:1f.)</i></b>, but angels present in worship <b><i>(cf.<br>
 <!-#-->1Co 4:9; Ps 138:1)</i></b> who would be shocked at the conduct of the<br>
 women since the angels themselves veil their faces before Jehovah<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 6:2)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:11 <B>{Howbeit}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;n\)</i></b>. This adversative clause limits the<br>
 preceding statement. Each sex is incomplete without <b><i>(\ch&#333;ris\,<br>
 apart from, with the ablative case)</i></b> the other. <B>{In the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 Kuri&#333;i\)</i></b>. In the sphere of the Lord, where Paul finds the<br>
 solution of all problems.<br>
 <br>
 11:12 <B>{Of}</B> <b><i>(\ek\)</i></b> <B>{--by}</B> <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b>. Ever since the first creation<br>
 man has come into existence by means of <b><i>(\dia\ with genitive)</i></b> the<br>
 woman. The glory and dignity of motherhood. Cf. _The Fine Art of<br>
 Motherhood_ by Ella Broadus Robertson.<br>
 <br>
 11:13 <B>{Is it seemly?}</B> <b><i>(\prepon estin;\)</i></b>. Periphrastic present<br>
 indicative rather than \prepei\. See on &#175;Mt 3:15. Paul appeals<br>
 to the sense of propriety among the Corinthians.<br>
 <br>
 11:14 <B>{Nature itself}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; phusis aut&#275;\)</i></b>. He reenforces the<br>
 appeal to custom by the appeal to nature in a question that<br>
 expects the affirmative answer <b><i>(\oude\)</i></b>. \Phusis\, from old verb<br>
 \phu&#333;\, to produce, like our word nature <b><i>(Latin _natura_)</i></b>, is<br>
 difficult to define. Here it means native sense of propriety <b><i>(cf.<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 2:14)</i></b> in addition to mere custom, but one that rests on the<br>
 objective difference in the constitution of things.<br>
 <br>
 11:15 <B>{Have long hair}</B> <b><i>(\kom&#257;i\)</i></b>. Present active subjunctive of<br>
 \koma&#333;\ <b><i>(from \kom&#275;\, hair)</i></b>, old verb, same contraction<br>
 <b><i>(\-a&#275;i=&#257;i\)</i></b> as the indicative <b><i>(\aei = &#257;i\)</i></b>, but subjunctive here<br>
 with \ean\ in third class condition. Long hair is a glory to a<br>
 woman and a disgrace to a man <b><i>(as we still feel)</i></b>. The long-haired<br>
 man! There is a papyrus example of a priest accused of letting<br>
 his hair grow long and of wearing woollen garments. <B>{For a<br>
 covering}</B> <b><i>(\anti peribolaiou\)</i></b>. Old word from \periball&#333;\ to<br>
 fling around, as a mantle <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 1:12)</i></b> or a covering or veil as<br>
 here. It is not in the place of a veil, but answering to <b><i>(\anti\,<br>
 in the sense of \anti\ in <!-#-->Joh 1:16)</i></b>, as a permanent endowment<br>
 <b><i>(\dedotai\, perfect passive indicative)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:16 <B>{Contentious}</B> <b><i>(\philoneikos\)</i></b>. Old adjective <b><i>(\philos,<br>
 neikos\)</i></b>, fond of strife. Only here in N.T. If he only existed in<br>
 this instance, the disputatious brother. <B>{Custom}</B> <b><i>(\sun&#275;theian\)</i></b>.<br>
 Old word from \sun&#275;th&#275;s\ <b><i>(\sun, &#275;thos\)</i></b>, like Latin _consuetudo_,<br>
 intercourse, intimacy. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->8:7 which see. "In<br>
 the sculptures of the catacombs the women have a close-fitting<br>
 head-dress, while the men have the hair short" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:17 <B>{This}</B> <b><i>(\touto\)</i></b>. Probably the preceding one about the<br>
 head-dress of women, and transition to what follows. <B>{I praise<br>
 you not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk epain&#333;\)</i></b>. In contrast to the praise in <!-#-->11:2.<br>
 <B>{For the better}</B> <b><i>(\eis to kreisson\)</i></b>. Neuter articular<br>
 comparative of \kratus\, but used as comparative of \kalos\,<br>
 good. Attic form \kreitton\. <B>{For the worse}</B> <b><i>(\eis to h&#275;sson\)</i></b>.<br>
 Old comparative from \h&#275;ka\, softly, used as comparative of<br>
 \kakos\, bad. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->2Co 12:15.<br>
 <br>
 11:18 <B>{First of all}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;ton men\)</i></b>. There is no antithesis<br>
 <b><i>(\deuteron de\, secondly, or \epeita de\, in the next place)</i></b><br>
 expressed. This is the primary reason for Paul's condemnation and<br>
 the only one given. <B>{When ye come together in the church}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sunerchomen&#333;n h&#275;m&#333;n en ekkl&#275;si&#257;i\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute. Here<br>
 \ekkl&#275;sia\ has the literal meaning of assembly. <B>{Divisions}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\schismata\)</i></b>. Accusative of general reference with the<br>
 infinitive \huparchein\ in indirect discourse. Old word for<br>
 cleft, rent, from \schiz&#333;\. Example in papyri for splinter of<br>
 wood. See on <!-#-->1:10. Not yet formal cleavages into two or more<br>
 organizations, but partisan divisions that showed in the<br>
 love-feasts and at the Lord's Supper. <B>{Partly}</B> <b><i>(\meros ti\)</i></b>.<br>
 Accusative of extent <b><i>(to some part)</i></b> like \panta\ in <!-#-->10:33. He<br>
 could have said \ek merous\ as in <!-#-->13:9. The rumours of strife<br>
 were so constant <b><i>(I keep on hearing, \akou&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:19 <B>{Must be}</B> <b><i>(\dei einai\)</i></b>. Since moral conditions are so bad<br>
 among you <b><i>(cf. chapters 1 to 6)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Mt 18:7. <B>{Heresies}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\haireseis\)</i></b>. The schisms naturally become <B>{factions}</B> or<br>
 <B>{parties}</B>. Cf. strifes <b><i>(\erides\)</i></b> in <!-#-->1:11. See on &#175;Ac 15:5 for<br>
 \haireseis\, a choosing, taking sides, holding views of one<br>
 party, heresy <b><i>(our word)</i></b>. "Heresy is theoretical schism, schism<br>
 practical heresy." Cf. <!-#-->Tit 3:10; 2Pe 2:1. In Paul only here and<br>
 <!-#-->Ga 5:20. <B>{That}</B> <b><i>(\hina\)</i></b>. God's purpose in these factions makes<br>
 <B>{the proved ones}</B> <b><i>(\hoi dokimoi\)</i></b> become <B>{manifest}</B> <b><i>(\phaneroi\)</i></b>.<br>
 "These \haireseis\ are a magnet attracting unsound and unsettled<br>
 minds" <b><i>(Findlay)</i></b>. It has always been so. Instance so-called<br>
 Christian Science, Russellism, New Thought, etc., today.<br>
 <br>
 11:20 <B>{To eat the Lord's Supper}</B> <b><i>(\Kuriakon deipnon phagein\)</i></b>.<br>
 \Kuriakos\, adjective from \Kurios\, belonging to or pertaining<br>
 to the Lord, is not just a biblical or ecclesiastical word, for<br>
 it is found in the inscriptions and papyri in the sense of<br>
 imperial <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient East_, p. 358)</i></b>, as<br>
 imperial finance, imperial treasury. It is possible that here the<br>
 term applies both to the \Agap&#275;\ or Love-feast <b><i>(a sort of church<br>
 supper or club supper held in connection with, before or after,<br>
 the Lord's Supper)</i></b> and the Eucharist or Lord's Supper. \Deipnon\,<br>
 so common in the Gospels, only here in Paul. The selfish conduct<br>
 of the Corinthians made it impossible to eat a Lord's Supper at<br>
 all.<br>
 <br>
 11:21 <B>{Taketh before}</B> <b><i>(\prolambanei\)</i></b>. Before others. Old verb to<br>
 take before others. It was conduct like this that led to the<br>
 complete separation between the Love-feast and the Lord's Supper.<br>
 It was not even a common meal together <b><i>(\koinon deipnon\)</i></b>, not to<br>
 say a Lord's \deipnon\. It was a mere <B>{grab-game}</B>. <B>{This one is<br>
 hungry}</B> <b><i>(\hos de pein&#257;i\)</i></b>. Demonstrative \hos\. Nothing is left<br>
 for him at the love-feast. <B>{Another is drunken}</B> <b><i>(\hos de<br>
 methuei\)</i></b>. Such disgusting conduct was considered shameful in<br>
 heathen club suppers. "Hungry poor meeting intoxicated rich, at<br>
 what was supposed to be a supper of the Lord" <b><i>(Robertson and<br>
 Plummer)</i></b>. On \methu&#333;\, to be drunk, see on &#175;Mt 24:49; Ac 2:15.<br>
 <br>
 11:22 <B>{What? Have ye not houses?}</B> <b><i>(\M&#275; gar oikias ouk echete;\)</i></b><br>
 The double negative <b><i>(\m&#275;--ouk\)</i></b> in the single question is like<br>
 the idiom in <!-#-->9:4f. which see. \M&#275;\ expects a negative answer<br>
 while \ouk\ negatives the verb \echete\. "For do you fail to have<br>
 houses?" Paul is not approving gluttony and drunkenness but only<br>
 expressing horror at their sacrilege <b><i>(despising, \kataphroneite\)</i></b><br>
 of the church of God. <B>{That have not}</B> <b><i>(\tous m&#275; echontas\)</i></b>. Not<br>
 those without houses, but those who have nothing, "the have-nots"<br>
 <b><i>(Findlay)</i></b> like <!-#-->2Co 8:12, in contrast with \hoi echontes\ "the<br>
 haves" <b><i>(the men of property)</i></b>. <B>{What shall I say to you?}</B> <b><i>(\ti<br>
 eip&#333; humin;\)</i></b> Deliberative subjunctive that well expresses Paul's<br>
 bewilderment.<br>
 <br>
 11:23 <B>{For I received of the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\ego gar parelabon apo tou<br>
 Kuriou\)</i></b>. Direct claim to revelation from the Lord Jesus on the<br>
 origin of the Lord's Supper. Luke's account <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:17-20)</i></b> is<br>
 almost identical with this one. He could easily have read I<br>
 Corinthians before he wrote his Gospel. See <!-#-->15:3 for use of<br>
 both \parelabon\ and \pared&#333;ka\. Note \para\ in both verbs. Paul<br>
 received the account from <b><i>(\para--apo\)</i></b> the Lord and passed it on<br>
 from himself to them, a true \paradosis\ <b><i>(tradition)</i></b> as in<br>
 <!-#-->11:2. <B>{He was betrayed}</B> <b><i>(\paredideto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive<br>
 indicative <b><i>(irregular form for \paredidoto\, Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 340)</i></b>. Same verb as \pared&#333;ka\ <b><i>(first aorist active<br>
 indicative just used for "I delivered")</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:24 <B>{When he had given thanks}</B> <b><i>(\eucharist&#275;sas\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active participle of \euchariste&#333;\ from which word our word<br>
 Eucharist comes, common late verb <b><i>(see on &#175;1:14)</i></b>. <B>{Which is for<br>
 you}</B> <b><i>(\to huper hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. \Kl&#333;menon\ <b><i>(broken)</i></b> of the Textus<br>
 Receptus <b><i>(King James Version)</i></b> is clearly not genuine. Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 22:19)</i></b> has \didomenon\ <b><i>(given)</i></b> which is the real idea here. As a<br>
 matter of fact the body of Jesus was not broken <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:36)</i></b>.<br>
 The bread was broken, but not the body of Jesus. <B>{In remembrance<br>
 of me}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n em&#275;n anamn&#275;sin\)</i></b>. The objective use of the<br>
 possessive pronoun \em&#275;n\. Not my remembrance of you, but your<br>
 remembrance of me. \Anamn&#275;sis\, from \anamimn&#275;sk&#333;\, to remind or<br>
 to recall, is an old word, but only here in N.T. save <!-#-->Lu 22:19<br>
 which see.<br>
 <br>
 11:25 <B>{After supper}</B> <b><i>(\meta to deipn&#275;sai\)</i></b>. \Meta\ and the<br>
 articular aorist active infinitive, "after the dining" <b><i>(or the<br>
 supping)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Lu 22:20. <B>{The new covenant}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; kain&#275;<br>
 diath&#275;k&#275;\)</i></b>. For \diath&#275;k&#275;\ see on &#175;Mt 26:28. For \kainos\ see on<br>
 &#175;Lu 5:38; 22:20. The position of \estin\ before \en t&#333;i haimati\<br>
 <b><i>(in my blood)</i></b> makes it a secondary or additional predicate and<br>
 not to be taken just with \diath&#275;k&#275;\ <b><i>(covenant or will)</i></b>. <B>{As oft<br>
 as ye drink it}</B> <b><i>(\hosakis an pin&#275;te\)</i></b>. Usual construction for<br>
 general temporal clause of repetition <b><i>(\an\ and the present<br>
 subjunctive with \hosakis\)</i></b>. So in verse <!-#-->26.<br>
 <br>
 11:26 <B>{Till he come}</B> <b><i>(\achri hou elth&#275;i\)</i></b>. Common idiom <b><i>(with or<br>
 without \an\)</i></b> with the aorist subjunctive for future time<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 975)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Lu 22:18 we have \he&#333;s hou<br>
 elth&#275;i\. The Lord's Supper is the great preacher <b><i>(\kataggellete\)</i></b><br>
 of the death of Christ till his second coming <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 26:29)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:27 <B>{Unworthily}</B> <b><i>(\anaxi&#333;s\)</i></b>. Old adverb, only here in N.T.,<br>
 not genuine in verse <!-#-->29. Paul defines his meaning in verse<br>
 <!-#-->29f. He does not say or imply that we ourselves must be<br>
 "worthy" <b><i>(\axioi\)</i></b> to partake of the Lord's Supper. No one would<br>
 ever partake on those terms. Many pious souls have abstained from<br>
 observing the ordinance through false exegesis here. <B>{Shall be<br>
 guilty}</B> <b><i>(\enochos estai\)</i></b>. Shall be held guilty as in <!-#-->Mt 5:21f.<br>
 which see. Shall be guilty of a crime committed against the body<br>
 and blood of the Lord by such sacrilege <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Heb 6:6; 10:29)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:28 <B>{Let a man prove himself}</B> <b><i>(\dokimazet&#333; anthr&#333;pos heauton\)</i></b>.<br>
 Test himself as he would a piece of metal to see if genuine. Such<br>
 examination of one's motives would have made impossible the<br>
 disgraceful scenes in verses <!-#-->20ff.<br>
 <br>
 11:29 <B>{If he discern not the body}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; diakrin&#333;n to s&#333;ma\)</i></b>.<br>
 So-called conditional use of the participle, "not judging the<br>
 body." Thus he eats and drinks judgment <b><i>(\krima\)</i></b> on himself. The<br>
 verb \dia-krin&#333;\ is an old and common word, our <B>{dis-cri-minate}</B>,<br>
 to distinguish. Eating the bread and drinking the wine as symbols<br>
 of the Lord's body and blood in death probes one's heart to the<br>
 very depths.<br>
 <br>
 11:30 <B>{And not a few sleep}</B> <b><i>(\kai koim&#333;ntai hikanoi\)</i></b>. Sufficient<br>
 number <b><i>(\hikanoi\)</i></b> are already asleep in death because of their<br>
 desecration of the Lord's table. Paul evidently had knowledge of<br>
 specific instances. A few would be too many.<br>
 <br>
 11:31 <B>{But if we discerned ourselves}</B> <b><i>(\ei de heautous<br>
 diekrinomen\)</i></b>. This condition of the second class, determined as<br>
 unfulfilled, assumes that they had not been judging themselves<br>
 discriminatingly, else they would not be judged <b><i>(\ekrinometha\)</i></b>.<br>
 Note distinction in the two verbs.<br>
 <br>
 11:32 <B>{Ye are chastened of the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\hupo tou Kuriou<br>
 paideuometha\)</i></b>. On this sense of \paideu&#333;\, from \pais\, child,<br>
 to train a child <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 7:22)</i></b>, to discipline with words <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti<br>
 2:25)</i></b>, to chastise with scourges see on &#175;Lu 23:16 <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 12:7)</i></b>,<br>
 and so by afflictions as here <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 12:6)</i></b>. \Hupo tou Kuriou\ can<br>
 be construed with \krinomenoi\ instead of with \paideuometha\.<br>
 <B>{With the world}</B> <b><i>(\sun t&#333;i kosm&#333;i\)</i></b>. Along with the world.<br>
 Afflictions are meant to separate us from the doom of the wicked<br>
 world. Final use of \hina m&#275;\ here with \katakrith&#333;men\ <b><i>(first<br>
 aorist passive subjunctive)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:33 <B>{Wait one for another}</B> <b><i>(\all&#275;lous ekdechesthe\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->Joh<br>
 5:3; Ac 17:16. That is common courtesy. Wait in turn. Vulgate<br>
 has _invicem expectate_.<br>
 <br>
 11:34 <B>{At home}</B> <b><i>(\en oik&#333;i\)</i></b>. If so hungry as all that <b><i>(verse<br>
 <!-#-->22)</i></b>. <B>{The rest}</B> <b><i>(\ta loipa\)</i></b>. He has found much fault with this<br>
 church, but he has not told all. <B>{I will set in order}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\diataxomai\)</i></b>. Not even Timothy and Titus can do it all.<br>
 <B>{Whensoever I come}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s an elth&#333;\)</i></b>. Common idiom for temporal<br>
 clause of future time <b><i>(conjunction like \h&#333;s\ with \an\ and<br>
 aorist subjunctive \elth&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
