<p>7:1 <B>{Are these things so?}</B> <b><i>(\ei tauta hout&#333;s echei\)</i></b>. On this use<br>
 of \ei\ in a direct question see on &#175;1:6. Literally "Do these<br>
 things hold thus?" A formal question by the high priest like our<br>
 "Do you plead guilty, or not guilty?" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. The abrupt<br>
 question of the high priest would serve to break the evident<br>
 spell of the angelic look on Stephen's face. Two charges had been<br>
 made against Stephen <b><i>(1)</i></b> speaking against the holy temple, <b><i>(2)</i></b><br>
 changing the customs which Moses had delivered. Stephen could not<br>
 give a yes or no answer to these two charges. There was an<br>
 element of truth in each of them and a large amount of error all<br>
 mixed together. So he undertakes to explain his real position by<br>
 the historical method, that is to say, by a rapid survey of God's<br>
 dealing with the people of Israel and the Gentiles. It is the<br>
 same method adopted by Paul in Pisidian Antioch <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 13:16ff.)</i></b><br>
 after he had become the successor of Stephen in his<br>
 interpretation of the universal mission of Christianity. If one<br>
 is disposed to say that Luke made up this speech to suit<br>
 Stephen's predicament, he has to explain how the style is less<br>
 Lukan than the narrative portions of Acts with knowledge of<br>
 Jewish traditions that a Greek would not be likely to know.<br>
 Precisely how Luke obtained the data for the speech we do not<br>
 know, but Saul heard it and Philip, one of the seven, almost<br>
 certainly. Both could have given Luke help about it. It is even<br>
 possible that some one took notes of this important address. We<br>
 are to remember also that the speech was interrupted at the end<br>
 and may not include all that Stephen meant to say. But enough is<br>
 given to give us a good idea of how Stephen met the first charge<br>
 "by showing that the worship of God is not confined to Jerusalem<br>
 or the Jewish temple" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. Then he answers the second charge<br>
 by proving that God had many dealings with their fathers before<br>
 Moses came and that Moses foretold the coming of the Messiah who<br>
 is now known to be Jesus. It is at this point <b><i>(verse <!-#-->51)</i></b> that<br>
 Stephen becomes passionate and so powerful that the wolves in the<br>
 Sanhedrin lose all self-control. It is a great and masterful<br>
 exposition of the worldwide mission of the gospel of Christ in<br>
 full harmony with the Great Commission of Christ. The apostles<br>
 had been so busy answering the Sadducees concerning the<br>
 Resurrection of Christ and maintaining their freedom to teach and<br>
 preach that they had not pushed the world-wide propaganda of the<br>
 gospel as Jesus had commanded after they had received the Promise<br>
 of the Father. But Stephen had proclaimed the same message of<br>
 Christ and was now facing the same fate. Peter's mind had been<br>
 enlightened by the Holy Spirit so that he could rightly interpret<br>
 Joel and David in the light of Pentecost. "So Stephen read the<br>
 history of the Old Testament with new eyes in the light of the<br>
 life and death of Jesus" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:2 <B>{Brethren and fathers}</B> <b><i>(\andres adelphoi kai pateres\)</i></b>. The<br>
 spectators <b><i>(brethren)</i></b> and members of the Sanhedrin <b><i>(fathers)</i></b> as<br>
 Paul in <!-#-->Ac 22:1. <B>{Hearken}</B> <b><i>(\akousate\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active imperative, Give me your attention now. <B>{The<br>
 God of glory}</B> <b><i>(\Ho theos t&#275;s dox&#275;s\)</i></b>. The God characterized by<br>
 glory <b><i>(genitive case, genus or kind)</i></b> as seen in the Shekinah, the<br>
 visible radiance of God. Jesus is also called "the Glory"=the<br>
 Shekinah in <!-#-->Jas 2:1. Cf. <!-#-->Ex 25:22; 40:34; Le 9:6; Heb 9:5. By<br>
 these words Stephen refutes the charge of blasphemy against God<br>
 in <!-#-->Ac 6:11. <B>{Appeared}</B> <b><i>(\&#333;phth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative of \hora&#333;\. See on &#175;Lu 23:43. Before there was temple<br>
 or tabernacle and away over in Mesopotamia <b><i>(Ur of the Chaldees,<br>
 <!-#-->Ge 11:31)</i></b>, even before <b><i>(\prin &#275;\ with the infinitive)</i></b> he dwelt<br>
 in Haran <b><i>(\Charran\, or Carrae not far from Edessa, where Crassus<br>
 met death after his defeat by the Parthians B.C. 53)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:3 <B>{Which I shall shew thee}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;n an soi deix&#333;\)</i></b>. Indefinite<br>
 relative clause with \an\ and the aorist active subjunctive <b><i>(same<br>
 form in first person singular as the future active indicative)</i></b>.<br>
 Abraham followed on as God led him.<br>
 <br>
 7:4 <B>{When his father was dead}</B> <b><i>(\meta to apothanein auton\)</i></b>.<br>
 \Meta\ with the accusative of the articular infinitive and the<br>
 accusative of general reference <b><i>(\auton\)</i></b>, regular Greek idiom.<br>
 In <!-#-->Ge 11:32 it is stated that Terah died at Haran at the age of<br>
 205. There are various explanations of the discrepancy, but no<br>
 one that seems certain. It is possible <b><i>(Hackett, Felten)</i></b> that<br>
 Abraham is mentioned first in <!-#-->Ge 11:26 because he became the<br>
 most prominent and was really younger than Haran his brother who<br>
 died before the first migration who was really sixty years older<br>
 than Abraham. According to this view Terah was 130 years old at<br>
 the birth of Abraham, leaving Abraham 75 at the death of Terah<br>
 <b><i>(205)</i></b>. <B>{Wherein ye now dwell}</B> <b><i>(\eis h&#275;n humeis nun katoikeite\)</i></b>.<br>
 Note \eis\ in the sense of \en\ as often. Note also emphatic use<br>
 of \humeis\ <b><i>(ye)</i></b> and now <b><i>(\nun\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:5 <B>{Not so much as to set his foot on}</B> <b><i>(\oude b&#275;ma podos\)</i></b>. From<br>
 <!-#-->De 2:5. Old word from \bain&#333;\, to go, to step. "Stepping of a<br>
 foot," only instance of this original meaning in the N.T. From<br>
 this it comes to mean a platform reached by steps, official seat<br>
 of a judge <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:19)</i></b>. The field purchased by Abraham <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge<br>
 23:9-17)</i></b> was not a gift from God. <B>{Promised}</B> <b><i>(\ep&#275;ggeilato\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist middle indicative of \epaggell&#333;\, common verb. See<br>
 <!-#-->Ge 12:7; 17:8; 48:4 for this promise. So God appeared again to<br>
 Abraham in a strange land. <B>{In possession}</B> <b><i>(\eis kataschesin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Late word, in LXX, and in N.T. only here and verse <!-#-->45. From<br>
 \katech&#333;\, to hold back, then to hold fast <b><i>(or down)</i></b>, to possess.<br>
 It was fulfilled in the descendants of Abraham. <B>{When as yet he<br>
 had no child}</B> <b><i>(\ouk ontos aut&#333;i teknou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute with<br>
 negative \ouk\ rather than \m&#275;\ to emphasize actual absence of a<br>
 child. He had only the promise of God about the land and the<br>
 child.<br>
 <br>
 7:6 <B>{On this wise}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s\)</i></b>. A free quotation from <!-#-->Ge 15:13.<br>
 <B>{Should sojourn}</B> <b><i>(\estai paroikon\)</i></b>. Shall be a sojourner,<br>
 \Paroikos\ <b><i>(\para\, beside, \oikos\, home)</i></b>, one dwelling near<br>
 one's home, but not of it, so a stranger, foreigner, old word,<br>
 often in LXX, temporary residence without full rights of<br>
 citizenship <b><i>(<!-#-->7:29; 13:17)</i></b>, and descriptive of Christians <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph<br>
 2:19; 1Pe 1:17; 2:11)</i></b>. <B>{In a strange land}</B> <b><i>(\en g&#275;i allotri&#257;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 In a land not one's own, that belongs to another, alien as in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 17:25f., which see. <B>{Four hundred years}</B> <b><i>(\et&#275; tetrakosia\)</i></b>.<br>
 Accusative of duration of time. As in <!-#-->Ge 15:13, but a round<br>
 number as in <!-#-->Ex 12:40 the time is 430 years. But in <!-#-->Ga 3:17<br>
 Paul, following the LXX in <!-#-->Ex 12:40, takes the 430 years to<br>
 cover the period in Canaan and the stay in Egypt, cutting the<br>
 sojourn in Egypt to about half. Josephus gives it both ways.<br>
 Hackett suggests two solutions, one that there were two ways of<br>
 reckoning the period among the Jews with no way of settling it,<br>
 the other that by the 430 years in Egypt the writers meant to<br>
 include Canaan also as merely the preliminary to the period in<br>
 Egypt.<br>
 <br>
 7:7 <B>{Will I judge}</B> <b><i>(\krin&#333; eg&#333;\)</i></b>. Future <b><i>(accent on \&#333;\)</i></b> active<br>
 indicative of \krin&#333;\ and \eg&#333;\ <b><i>(I)</i></b> expressed is emphatic. <B>{In<br>
 this place}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i top&#333;i tout&#333;i\)</i></b>. Quoted from <!-#-->Ex 3:12 and<br>
 referring to Sinai or Horeb, but Stephen applies it to the<br>
 Promised Land.<br>
 <br>
 7:8 <B>{The covenant of circumcision}</B> <b><i>(\diath&#275;k&#275;n peritom&#275;s\)</i></b>. A<br>
 covenant marked by <b><i>(genitive)</i></b> circumcision <b><i>(no article)</i></b> of which<br>
 circumcision is the sign <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 4:11)</i></b> as set forth in <!-#-->Ge<br>
 17:9-14. In the ancient Greek \diath&#275;k&#275;\ was usually will<br>
 <b><i>(Latin, _testamentum_)</i></b> and \sunth&#275;k&#275;\ was used for covenant<br>
 <b><i>(\sun\, together, rather than \dia\, between)</i></b>. But the LXX and<br>
 the N.T. use \diath&#275;k&#275;\ for covenant <b><i>(will in <!-#-->Heb 9:15f.)</i></b> as<br>
 Lightfoot on <!-#-->Ga 3:16 says: "The LXX translation and New<br>
 Testament writers probably preferred \diath&#275;k&#275;\ as better<br>
 expressing the <B>{free grace}</B> of God than \sunth&#275;k&#275;\." <B>{And so}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai hout&#333;s\)</i></b>. After the covenant was made and as a sign and<br>
 seal of it.<br>
 <br>
 7:9 <B>{Moved with jealousy}</B> <b><i>(\z&#275;l&#333;santes\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 participle of \z&#275;lo&#333;\, old verb from \z&#275;los\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 5:17)</i></b>, to burn<br>
 or boil with zeal, and then with envy as here <b><i>(<!-#-->17:5, etc.)</i></b> and<br>
 <!-#-->Ge 37:11.<br>
 <br>
 7:10 <B>{Delivered him out}</B> <b><i>(\exeilato auton ek\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 middle indicative of \exaire&#333;\, old verb to take out, snatch out.<br>
 Note repetition of \ek\. <B>{Pharaoh King of Egypt}</B> <b><i>(\Phara&#333;<br>
 basile&#333;s Aiguptou\)</i></b>. Pharaoh is not a name, but a title, the<br>
 Egyptian _per&#257;&#257;_ meaning great house.<br>
 <br>
 7:11 <B>{Found no sustenance}</B> <b><i>(\ouch h&#275;uriskon chortasmata\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active, kept on not finding. <B>{Chortasmata}</B> is from<br>
 <B>{chortaz&#333;}</B>, originally to feed with grass <b><i>(\chortos\)</i></b> or herbs.<br>
 Old word, but only here in the N.T. and includes food for both<br>
 men and animals. In <!-#-->Ge 24:25,32 it is fodder for the cattle, a<br>
 first necessity for owners of herds of cattle.<br>
 <br>
 7:12 <B>{That there was corn}</B> <b><i>(\onta sitia\)</i></b>. Participle <b><i>(present<br>
 active of \eimi\)</i></b> in indirect discourse, after \akousas\, "heard<br>
 of corn being in Egypt." \Sitia\ is diminutive of \sitos\ and<br>
 means grain <b><i>(wheat, barley, not our maize or Indian corn)</i></b>, old<br>
 word also for provisions, victuals, here only in the N.T. <B>{The<br>
 first time}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;ton\)</i></b>. While Jacob himself remained in Canaan<br>
 before he went down to Egypt and died there <b><i>(verse <!-#-->15f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:13 <B>{At the second time}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i deuter&#333;i\)</i></b>. This expression<br>
 only here in the N.T. This second visit is recorded in <!-#-->Ge<br>
 45:1ff. <B>{Became manifest}</B> <b><i>(\phaneron egeneto\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Ge 41:12<br>
 the fact that Joseph was a Hebrew had been incidentally mentioned<br>
 to Pharaoh, but now it was made clear to him.<br>
 <br>
 7:14 <B>{Three-score and fifteen souls}</B> <b><i>(\en psuchais hebdom&#275;konta<br>
 pente\)</i></b>. Stephen follows the LXX which counts some grandchildren<br>
 of Joseph and so makes it 75 whereas <!-#-->Ge 46:26 has 66 and then<br>
 the next verse makes it <!-#-->70 including Jacob and Joseph with his<br>
 two sons. The use of \en\ means "consisting in."<br>
 <br>
 7:16 <B>{They were carried over unto Shechem}</B> <b><i>(\meteteth&#275;san eis<br>
 Suchem\)</i></b>. First aorist passive of \metatith&#275;mi\, only here in the<br>
 N.T. in this sense of changing places. Jacob was buried in the<br>
 cave of Machpelah <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 50:13)</i></b>. The O.T. does not say where the<br>
 sons of Jacob were buried save that Joseph was buried in Shechem<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Jos 24:32)</i></b>. Possibly only "our fathers" without Jacob is the<br>
 subject of "were carried." <B>{Which Abraham bought}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;i &#333;n&#275;sato<br>
 Abraam\)</i></b>. Hackett is sure that our present text is wrong. Hort<br>
 notes some sixty "primitive errors" in the critical text of the<br>
 N.T. It is possible that this is also one. If "Jacob" is<br>
 substituted for "Abraham," the matter is cleared up. "It is quite<br>
 as likely, judging _a priori_, that the word producing the error<br>
 escaped from some early copyist as that so glaring an error was<br>
 committed by Stephen" <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>. At any rate Abraham bought a<br>
 burying-place, the cave of Machpelah, from Ephron the Hittite at<br>
 Hebron <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 23:16)</i></b>, while Jacob bought a field from the sons of<br>
 Hamor at Shechem <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 33:19; Jos 24:32)</i></b>. Abraham had built an<br>
 altar at Shechem when he entered Canaan <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 12:6f.)</i></b>. It is<br>
 possible, of course, that Abraham also bought the ground on which<br>
 the altar stood. <B>{In Shechem}</B> <b><i>(\en Suchem\)</i></b>. This is the reading<br>
 of Aleph B C instead of the Textus Receptus \tou Suchem\ which<br>
 makes it "Hamar the father of Sichem." "In Shechem" is the true<br>
 reading.<br>
 <br>
 7:17 <B>{Drew nigh}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;ggizen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, was drawing nigh.<br>
 <br>
 7:18 <B>{Another king}</B> <b><i>(\basileus heteros\)</i></b>. A different kind of<br>
 king also, probably a king of the new dynasty after the shepherd<br>
 kings had been expelled from Egypt. <B>{Who knew not Joseph}</B> <b><i>(\hos<br>
 ouk &#275;idei ton I&#333;s&#275;ph\)</i></b>. Second past perfect of \oida\ used like<br>
 an imperfect. Joseph's history and services meant nothing to the<br>
 new king. "The previous dynasty had been that of the Hyksos: the<br>
 new king was Ahmes who drove out the Hyksos" <b><i>(Knobel)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:19 <B>{Dealt subtilly}</B> <b><i>(\katasophisamenos\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 participle of \katasophizomai\, late compound <b><i>(\kata\ and<br>
 \sophiz&#333;\, old verb, to make wise, to become wise, then to play<br>
 the sophist)</i></b>, perfective use of \kata\. In the LXX, but here only<br>
 in the N.T. To use fraud, craft, deceit. <B>{That they should cast<br>
 out their babes}</B> <b><i>(\tou poiein ta breph&#275; ektheta\)</i></b>. \Tou poiein\<br>
 <b><i>(genitive of the articular present infinitive)</i></b> can be either<br>
 design or result. The Revised Version here takes it as purpose<br>
 while the Authorized as result. In either case Pharaoh required<br>
 the Israelites to expose their children to death, a possible<br>
 practice done voluntarily in heathen China and by heathen in<br>
 so-called Christian lands. But the Israelites fought against such<br>
 an iniquity. The word \ektheta\ <b><i>(exposed, cast out)</i></b> is a verbal<br>
 adjective from \ektith&#275;mi\. It is an old word, but here only in<br>
 the N.T. and not in the LXX. <B>{To the end they might not live}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eis to m&#275; z&#333;ogoneisthai\)</i></b>. Purpose with \eis\ and the articular<br>
 infinitive <b><i>(present middle)</i></b>. This compound verb is from<br>
 \z&#333;ogonos\ <b><i>(from \z&#333;os\, alive, and \gen&#333;\, to bear)</i></b> and is used<br>
 by late writers and the LXX. It is three times in the N.T. <b><i>(here,<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 17:33; 1Ti 6:13)</i></b> in the sense to preserve alive.<br>
 <br>
 7:20 <B>{Exceeding fair}</B> <b><i>(\asteios t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>. Ethical dative, fair<br>
 to God <b><i>(as God looked at him)</i></b>. \Asteios\ is from \astu\, city,<br>
 and so means "of the city," with city manners and polish. Old<br>
 word, only twice in the N.T. <b><i>(here and <!-#-->Heb 11:23)</i></b> and both<br>
 times about Moses and taken from <!-#-->Ex 2:2. <B>{He was nourished}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anetraph&#275;\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive indicative of \anatreph&#333;\.<br>
 He was brought up at home for three months in defiance of the new<br>
 Pharaoh.<br>
 <br>
 7:21 <B>{When he was cast out}</B> <b><i>(\ektethentos autou\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute with first aorist passive participle of \ektith&#275;mi\.<br>
 <B>{Took up}</B> <b><i>(\aneilato\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle indicative <b><i>(with<br>
 first aorist vowel \a\ instead of \e\ as often in the _Koin&#275;_)</i></b> of<br>
 \anaire&#333;\, common in the N.T. in the sense of take up and make<br>
 away with, to kill as in verse <!-#-->28, but here only in the N.T. in<br>
 the original sense of taking up from the ground and with the<br>
 middle voice <b><i>(for oneself)</i></b>. Quoted here from <!-#-->Ex 2:5. The word<br>
 was used of old for picking up exposed children as here. Vincent<br>
 quotes Aristophanes <b><i>(_Clouds_, 531)</i></b>: "I exposed <b><i>(the child)</i></b>, and<br>
 some other women, having taken it, adopted <b><i>(\aneileto\)</i></b> it."<br>
 Vulgate has _sustulit_. "Adopted" is the idea here. "After the<br>
 birth of a child the father took it up to his bosom, if he meant<br>
 to rear it; otherwise it was doomed to perish" <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Nourished him for her own son}</B> <b><i>(\anethrepsato auton heaut&#275;i eis<br>
 huion\)</i></b>. Literally, "she nursed him up for herself <b><i>(\heaut&#275;i\<br>
 besides middle voice)</i></b> as a son." This use of \eis\=as occurs in<br>
 the old Greek, but is very common in the LXX as a translation of<br>
 the Hebrew _le_. The tradition is that she designed Moses for the<br>
 throne as the Pharaoh had no son <b><i>(Josephus, _Ant_. ii. 9, 7)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:22 <B>{Was instructed}</B> <b><i>(\epaideuth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative of \paideu&#333;\, to train a child <b><i>(\pais\)</i></b>, the usual<br>
 idea in ancient Greek as here. The notion of chastisement <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb<br>
 12:6)</i></b> is also in the old Greek and especially in the LXX and the<br>
 N.T. Here with instrumental case <b><i>(\pas&#275;i sophi&#257;i\)</i></b> or the<br>
 locative. The accusative would usually be retained after this<br>
 verb. The priestly caste in Egypt was noted for their knowledge<br>
 of science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics. This reputation<br>
 was proverbial <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ki 4:30)</i></b>. Modern discoveries have thrown much<br>
 light on the ancient civilization of Egypt. Moses, like Paul, was<br>
 a man of the schools. <B>{Mighty in his words and works}</B> <b><i>(\dunatos<br>
 en logois kai ergois autou\)</i></b>. The same phrase used of Jesus in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 24:19. The adjective \dunatos\ is employed of Apollos as an<br>
 interpreter of the Scriptures <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:24)</i></b>. Moses did not have<br>
 the rhetorical skill or eloquence of Aaron <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 4:10)</i></b>, but his<br>
 words like his deeds carried weight and power.<br>
 <br>
 7:23 <B>{When he was well-nigh forty years old}</B> <b><i>(\H&#333;s epl&#275;routo<br>
 aut&#333;i tessarakontaet&#275;s chronos\)</i></b>. A rather awkward Greek idiom<br>
 for the English: "When a forty year old time <b><i>(same idiom in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 13:18 and only twice in the N.T.)</i></b> was being fulfilled<br>
 <b><i>(\epl&#275;routo\, imperfect passive)</i></b> for him <b><i>(dative case)</i></b>." The life<br>
 of Moses is divided into three periods of forty years each <b><i>(in<br>
 Egypt 40 years, in Midian 40, governed Israel 40, 120 when he<br>
 died, <!-#-->De 34:7)</i></b>. <B>{It came into his heart}</B> <b><i>(\aneb&#275; epi t&#275;n<br>
 kardian autou\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative of \anabain&#333;\,<br>
 common verb. Came up as if from the lower deeps of his nature.<br>
 This Hebrew image occurs in <!-#-->Jer 3:16; Isa 65:17; 1Co 2:9. <B>{To<br>
 visit}</B> <b><i>(\episkepsasthai\)</i></b>. First aorist middle infinitive of<br>
 \episkeptomai\, old verb to go to see for oneself, with his own<br>
 eyes, to help if possible. Used of God visiting his people <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 7:16)</i></b>. Our "visit" is from Latin _video_, to see, _visito_, to<br>
 go to see. During the Welsh mining troubles the Prince of Wales<br>
 made a sympathetic visit to see for himself the actual condition<br>
 of the coal miners. Moses desired to know first hand how his<br>
 kinsmen were faring.<br>
 <br>
 7:24 <B>{Suffer wrong}</B> <b><i>(\adikoumenon\)</i></b>. Present passive participle<br>
 of \adik&#275;o\. By blows <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 2:11)</i></b>. <B>{Avenged}</B> <b><i>(\epoi&#275;sen<br>
 ekdik&#275;sin\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of \poie&#333;\. This<br>
 idiom occurs in <!-#-->Lu 18:7 with \ekdik&#275;sin\ <b><i>(this from \ekdike&#333;\<br>
 and that from \ekdikos\ without right or law \dik&#275;\ and then<br>
 exacting law of right out of \ek\ one, exacting vengeance)</i></b>. <B>{Him<br>
 that was oppressed}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i kataponoumen&#333;i\)</i></b>. Present passive<br>
 articular participle in the dative case of \kataponeo\, to tire<br>
 down with toil, to treat roughly, common in late Greek, in the<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->2Pe 2:7 <b><i>(sore distressed)</i></b>. The man was on<br>
 the point of being overcome. <B>{Smiting}</B> <b><i>(\pataxas\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active participle of \patass&#333;\, in the old Greek the beat of the<br>
 heart, only in the LXX and N.T. to smite a deadly blow as here<br>
 like \pl&#275;ss&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 7:25 <B>{He supposed}</B> <b><i>(\enomizen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \nomiz&#333;\. He<br>
 was supposing, Stephen explains, when he smote the Egyptian.<br>
 <B>{That his brethren understood}</B> <b><i>(\sunienai tous adelphous\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present active infinitive of \suni&#275;mi\, to send <b><i>(put)</i></b> together,<br>
 to grasp, to comprehend, in indirect discourse with the<br>
 accusative of general reference. <B>{By his hand was giving them<br>
 deliverance}</B> <b><i>(\dia cheiros autou did&#333;sin sot&#275;rian autois\)</i></b>.<br>
 Picturesque use of "hand" as in <!-#-->2:23, present active indicative<br>
 of \did&#333;mi\ retained in indirect discourse after imperfect<br>
 \enomizen\. But they understood not <b><i>(\hoi de ou sun&#275;kan\)</i></b>. Page<br>
 notes "the rhetorical power of these words" from Stephen.<br>
 \Sun&#275;kan\ <b><i>(first aorist indicative, \k\ aorist)</i></b> refers to<br>
 \sunienai\ just before.<br>
 <br>
 7:26 <B>{The day following}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i epious&#275;i h&#275;mer&#257;i\)</i></b>. Locative case,<br>
 "on the following day" <b><i>(from \epeimi\, to come upon, to approach,<br>
 present active participle \epi&#333;n -ousa, -on\)</i></b>. Common phrase in<br>
 old Greek both with \h&#275;mera\ <b><i>(day)</i></b> as here and without as<br>
 <!-#-->16:11. Only in Acts in the N.T. <B>{Appeared}</B> <b><i>(\&#333;phth&#275;\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive indicative of \hora&#333;\ not with idea that only a<br>
 vision but rather that it was sudden or unexpected. <B>{As they<br>
 strove}</B> <b><i>(\machomenois\)</i></b>. Present middle participle of \machomai\,<br>
 actually fighting. <B>{Would have set them at one again}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sun&#275;llassen autous eis eir&#275;nen\)</i></b>. Better, he tried to reconcile<br>
 them <b><i>(or change them into peace)</i></b>. It is the conative imperfect<br>
 active as in <!-#-->Mt 3:14 of \sunallass&#333;\, only here in the N.T.<br>
 though common in the old Greek. Vulgate has _reconciliabat_. The<br>
 usual word in the N.T. for reconcile is \katallass&#333;\. <B>{Do ye<br>
 wrong one to another}</B> <b><i>(\adikeite all&#275;lous\)</i></b>. The same word used<br>
 in verse <!-#-->24 of the wrong done one of the Hebrews by the<br>
 Egyptian, but here both are "brethren."<br>
 <br>
 7:27 <B>{Thrust him away}</B> <b><i>(\ap&#333;sato auton\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 indicative <b><i>(_Koin&#275;_ for Attic \ape&#333;sato\)</i></b> of \ap&#333;the&#333;\, to push<br>
 away from oneself in middle voice as here, common in old Greek.<br>
 Again in verse <!-#-->39; 13:46; Ro 11:1; 1Ti 1:19. It is always the<br>
 man who is doing the wrong who is hard to reconcile.<br>
 <br>
 7:28 <B>{Wouldest thou kill me?}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; anelein me su theleis\)</i></b>.<br>
 Expecting the answer no, but a thrust direct at Moses, Do you<br>
 wish to kill me <b><i>(note \me su\ right together, <B>{me thou}</B>)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ex<br>
 2:14 quoted by Stephen.<br>
 <br>
 7:29 <B>{Sojourner}</B> <b><i>(\paroikos\)</i></b>. Temporary dweller <b><i>(cf. Abraham in<br>
 verse <!-#-->6)</i></b> in Midian though for forty years.<br>
 <br>
 7:30 Sentence begins with genitive absolute again. <B>{In a flame of<br>
 fire in a bush}</B> <b><i>(\en phlogi puros batou\)</i></b>. Horeb in <!-#-->Ex 3:1; but<br>
 Sinai and Horeb were "probably peaks of one mountain range"<br>
 <b><i>(Page)</i></b>, Horeb "the mountain of the dried-up ground," Sinai "the<br>
 mountain of the thorns." Literally, "in the flame of fire of a<br>
 bush" <b><i>(two genitives, \puros\ and \batou\ dependent on \phlogi\,<br>
 flame)</i></b>. Descriptive genitives as in <!-#-->9:15; 2Th 1:8. \Batos\<br>
 <b><i>(bush)</i></b> is the wild acacia <b><i>(_mimosa nilotica_)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Ex 3:20 it is<br>
 Jehovah who speaks. Hence "angel" here with Stephen is understood<br>
 to be the Angel of the Presence, the Eternal Logos of the Father,<br>
 the Angel of Jehovah.<br>
 <br>
 7:31 <B>{The sight}</B> <b><i>(\to horama\)</i></b>. Used of visions in the N.T. as in<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 17:9. <B>{As he drew near}</B> <b><i>(\proserchomenou autou\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute with present middle participle of \proserchomai\. <B>{A<br>
 voice of the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\ph&#333;n&#275; kuriou\)</i></b>. Here the angel of Jehovah of<br>
 verse <!-#-->30 is termed Jehovah himself. Jesus makes powerful use of<br>
 these words in his reply to the Sadducees in defence of the<br>
 doctrine of the resurrection and the future life <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 12:26; Mt<br>
 22:32; Lu 20:37f.)</i></b> that God here describes himself as the God of<br>
 the living. <B>{Trembled}</B> <b><i>(\entromos genomenos\)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 becoming tremulous or terrified. The adjective \entromos\ <b><i>(\en,<br>
 tromos\ from \trem&#333;\, to tremble, to quake)</i></b> occurs in Plutarch<br>
 and the LXX. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ac 16:29. <B>{Durst not}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ouk etolma\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, was not daring, negative<br>
 conative imperfect.<br>
 <br>
 7:33 <B>{Holy ground}</B> <b><i>(\g&#275; hagia\)</i></b>. The priests were barefooted when<br>
 they ministered in the temple. Moslems enter their mosques<br>
 barefooted today. Cf. <!-#-->Jos 5:15. <B>{Sandal}</B> <b><i>(\hupod&#275;ma\, bound<br>
 under)</i></b> is here "a distributive singular" <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>. Even the<br>
 ground near the bush was "holy," a fine example for Stephen's<br>
 argument.<br>
 <br>
 7:34 <B>{I have surely seen}</B> <b><i>(\id&#333;n eidon\)</i></b>. Imitation of the Hebrew<br>
 infinitive absolute, <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 3:7)</i></b> "Seeing I saw" <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Heb 6:14)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{The affliction}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n kak&#333;sin\)</i></b>. From \kako&#333;\, to treat evilly<br>
 <b><i>(from \kakos\, evil)</i></b>. Old word, here only in the N.T. and from<br>
 <!-#-->Ex 3:7. <B>{Groaning}</B> <b><i>(\stenagmou\)</i></b>. Old word from \stenaz&#333;\, to<br>
 sigh, to groan. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ro 8:26. Root \sten\<br>
 in our word stentorian. <B>{I am come down}</B> <b><i>(\kateb&#275;n\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active indicative of \katabain&#333;\, I came down. <B>{To<br>
 deliver}</B> <b><i>(\exelesthai\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle infinitive of<br>
 \exaire&#333;\, to take out for myself. <B>{I will send}</B> <b><i>(\aposteil&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active subjunctive <b><i>(hortatory of \apostell&#333;\, "Let<br>
 me send")</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:35 <B>{This Moses}</B> <b><i>(\Touton ton M&#333;us&#275;n\)</i></b>. Rhetorical repetition<br>
 follows this description of Moses <b><i>(five times, anaphora, besides<br>
 the use here, six cases of \houtos\ here about Moses: verse <!-#-->35<br>
 twice, <!-#-->36,37,38,40)</i></b>. Clearly Stephen means to draw a parallel<br>
 between Moses and Jesus. They in Egypt <B>{denied}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rn&#275;santo\)</i></b><br>
 Moses as now you the Jews denied <b><i>(\&#275;rn&#275;sasthe\, <!-#-->3:13)</i></b> Jesus.<br>
 Those in Egypt scouted Moses as "ruler and judge" <b><i>(verses<br>
 <!-#-->27,35, \archonta kai dikast&#275;n\)</i></b> and God "hath sent"<br>
 <b><i>(\apestalken\, perfect active indicative, state of completion)</i></b><br>
 Moses "both a ruler and a deliverer" <b><i>(\archonta kai lutr&#333;t&#275;n\)</i></b> as<br>
 Jesus was to be <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:68; 2:38; Heb 9:12; Tit 2:14)</i></b>. "Ransomer"<br>
 or "Redeemer" <b><i>(\lutr&#333;t&#275;s\)</i></b> is not found elsewhere, \lutron\<br>
 <b><i>(ransom)</i></b>, \lutro&#333;\, to ransom, and \lutr&#333;sis\, ransoming or<br>
 redemption, are found often. In <!-#-->Ac 5:31 Christ is termed<br>
 "Prince and Saviour." <B>{With the hand}</B> <b><i>(\sun cheiri\)</i></b>. So the<br>
 correct text. The Pharisees had accused Stephen of blaspheming<br>
 "against Moses and God" <b><i>(<!-#-->6:11)</i></b>. Stephen here answers that<br>
 slander by showing how Moses led the people out of Egypt in<br>
 co-operation <b><i>(\sun\)</i></b> with the hand of the Angel of Jehovah.<br>
 <br>
 7:37 <B>{Like unto me}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s eme\)</i></b>. This same passage Peter quoted<br>
 to the crowd in Solomon's Porch <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 3:22)</i></b>. Stephen undoubtedly<br>
 means to argue that Moses was predicting the Messiah as a prophet<br>
 like himself who is no other than Jesus so that these Pharisees<br>
 are in reality opposing Moses. It was a neat turn.<br>
 <br>
 7:38 <B>{In the church in the wilderness}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i ekkl&#275;si&#257;i en t&#275;i<br>
 er&#275;m&#333;i\)</i></b>. Better rendered "congregation" here as in <!-#-->Heb 2:12<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps 22:22)</i></b>, the people of Israel gathered at Mt. Sinai, the<br>
 whole nation. Moses is here represented as receiving the law from<br>
 an angel as in <!-#-->Heb 2:2; Ga 3:19 <b><i>(<!-#-->De 33:2, LXX)</i></b> and so was a<br>
 mediator <b><i>(\mesit&#275;s\)</i></b> or middle man between the angel and the<br>
 people whereas Jesus is the Mediator of a better covenant <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb<br>
 8:6)</i></b>. But Exodus does not speak of an angel. <B>{Living oracles}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\logia z&#333;nta\)</i></b>. A \logion\ is a little word <b><i>(diminutive of<br>
 \logos\)</i></b>. Common in the old Greek, LXX, Philo, in ecclesiastical<br>
 writers for sayings of Christ, Papias <b><i>(for instance)</i></b> saying that<br>
 Matthew wrote in Hebrew <b><i>(Aramaic)</i></b> "Logia of Jesus." Oxyrhynchus<br>
 papyri fragments called "Logia of Jesus" are of much interest<br>
 though only fragments. The Greeks used it of the "oracles" or<br>
 brief sayings from Delphi. In the N.T. the word occurs only four<br>
 times <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 7:38; Ro 3:2; Heb 5:12; 1Pe 4:11)</i></b>. Here the<br>
 participle \z&#333;nta\, living, is the same used by Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe<br>
 2:4f.)</i></b>, stone <b><i>(\lithos\)</i></b> of Christ and Christians. The words<br>
 from God to Moses are still "living" today. In <!-#-->1Pe 4:11 the<br>
 word is applied to one who speaks \logia theou\ <b><i>(oracles of God)</i></b>.<br>
 In <!-#-->Ro 3:2 Paul refers to the substance of the law and of<br>
 prophecy. In <!-#-->Heb 5:12 the writer means the substance of the<br>
 Christian religious teaching.<br>
 <br>
 7:39 <B>{To whom}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;i\)</i></b>. That is Moses, this Moses. <B>{Would not be}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ouk &#275;thel&#275;san genesthai\)</i></b>. Aorist active, negative aorist, were<br>
 unwilling to become <b><i>(\genesthai\)</i></b> obedient. <B>{Thrust him from<br>
 them}</B> <b><i>(\ap&#333;santo\)</i></b>. Indirect middle of the very verb used of the<br>
 man <b><i>(verse <!-#-->27)</i></b> who "thrust" Moses away from him. <B>{Turned back}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\estraph&#275;san\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive indicative of \streph&#333;\,<br>
 to turn. They yearned after the fleshpots of Egypt and even the<br>
 gods of Egypt. It is easy now to see why Stephen has patiently<br>
 led his hearers through this story. He is getting ready for the<br>
 home-thrust.<br>
 <br>
 7:40 <B>{Gods which shall go before us}</B> <b><i>(\theous hoi proporeusontai<br>
 h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Ex 32:1. As guides and protectors, perhaps with some<br>
 allusion to the pillar of fire and of cloud that had gone before<br>
 them <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 13:21)</i></b>. The future indicative here with \hoi\<br>
 <b><i>(relative)</i></b> expresses purpose. <B>{Ye wot not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk oidamen\)</i></b>. We do<br>
 not know. How quickly they had forgotten both God and Moses while<br>
 Moses was absent in the mount with God. <B>{Become of him}</B> <b><i>(\egeneto<br>
 aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Happened to him. "This" <b><i>(\houtos\)</i></b> here is a<br>
 contemptuous allusion to Moses by the people.<br>
 <br>
 7:41 <B>{They made a calf}</B> <b><i>(\emoschopoi&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of \moschopoie&#333;\, here only in the N.T. and unknown<br>
 elsewhere. The LXX <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 32:3)</i></b> has \epoi&#275;se moschon\ from which<br>
 phrase the word is evidently made. Aaron made the calf, but so<br>
 did the people <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 32:35)</i></b>. <B>{The idol}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i eid&#333;l&#333;i\)</i></b>. Stephen<br>
 calls it by the right name. The people said it was their way of<br>
 worshipping Jehovah! So the Egyptians worshipped the bull Apis at<br>
 Memphis as the symbol of Osiris <b><i>(the sun)</i></b>. They had another<br>
 sacred bull Mnevis at Leontopolis. \Eid&#333;lon\ <b><i>(from \eidos\, form<br>
 or figure)</i></b> is the image or likeness of anything. The heathen<br>
 worship the god through the image or idol. <B>{Rejoiced}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\euphrainonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect, middle, kept on rejoicing <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex<br>
 32:6,18)</i></b> or making merry.<br>
 <br>
 7:42 <B>{Gave them up}</B> <b><i>(\pared&#333;ken\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative<br>
 of \paradid&#333;mi\. This same form occurs three times like clods on<br>
 a coffin in a grave in <!-#-->Ro 1:24,26,28 where Paul speaks of God<br>
 giving the heathen up to their lusts. <B>{To serve the host of<br>
 heaven}</B> <b><i>(\latreuein t&#275;i strati&#257;i tou ouranou\)</i></b>. The verb<br>
 \latreu&#333;\ is used of the worship of God <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 4:10)</i></b> as well as of<br>
 idols as here <b><i>(from \latron\, hire, \latris\, hireling, then to<br>
 serve)</i></b>. But the worship of the host of heaven <b><i>(<!-#-->De 17:3; 2Ki<br>
 17:16; 21:3; 2Ch 33:3,5; Jer 8:2; 19:13)</i></b> is Sabaism or worship<br>
 of the host <b><i>(\stratia\)</i></b> of heaven <b><i>(sun, moon, and stars)</i></b> instead<br>
 of the Lord of hosts. This star-worship greatly injured the Jews.<br>
 <B>{In the book of the prophets}</B> <b><i>(\en bibl&#333;i t&#333;n proph&#275;t&#333;n\)</i></b>. That<br>
 is the twelve minor prophets which the Jews counted as one book<br>
 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ac 13:40)</i></b>. This quotation is from <!-#-->Am 5:25-27. The<br>
 greater prophets were Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel. <B>{Slain beasts}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sphagia\)</i></b>. Here only in the N.T. <b><i>(from <!-#-->Am 5:25)</i></b> \sphag&#275;\,<br>
 slaughter, \sphaz&#333;\, to slay.<br>
 <br>
 7:43 <B>{The tabernacle of Moloch}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n sk&#275;n&#275;n tou Moloch\)</i></b>. Or<br>
 tent of Moloch which they took up after each halt instead of the<br>
 tabernacle of Jehovah. Moloch was the god of the Amorites to whom<br>
 children were offered as live sacrifices, an ox-headed image with<br>
 arms outstretched in which children were placed and hollow<br>
 underneath so that fire could burn underneath. <B>{The star of the<br>
 god Rephan}</B> <b><i>(\to astron tou theou Rompha\)</i></b>. Spelled also Romphan<br>
 and Remphan. Supposed to be Coptic for the star Saturn to which<br>
 the Egyptians, Arabs, and Phoenicians gave worship. But some<br>
 scholars take the Hebrew _Kiyyoon_ to mean statues and not a<br>
 proper name at all, "statues of your gods" carried in procession,<br>
 making "figures" <b><i>(\tupous\)</i></b> with both "tabernacle" and "star"<br>
 which they carried in procession. <B>{I will carry}</B> <b><i>(\metoiki&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 Attic future of \metoikis&#333;\ from \metoikiz&#333;\. <B>{Beyond Babylon}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epekeina Babul&#333;nos\)</i></b>. The Hebrew and the LXX have "beyond<br>
 Damascus." An adverbial preposition <b><i>(\ep' ekeina\ with \mer&#275;\<br>
 understood)</i></b> used in the old Greek and the LXX with the ablative<br>
 case and meaning "beyond." Here only in the N.T. in quotation<br>
 from <!-#-->Am 5:27.<br>
 <br>
 7:44 <B>{The tabernacle of the testimony}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; sk&#275;n&#275; tou<br>
 marturiou\)</i></b>. Probably suggested by the mention of "the tabernacle<br>
 of Moloch" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->43)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 17:4 for discussion of<br>
 \sk&#275;n&#275;\ <b><i>(from \skia\, shadow, root \ska\, to cover)</i></b>. This first<br>
 sanctuary was not the temple, but the tent in the wilderness.<br>
 "Stephen passes on from the conduct of the Israelites to his<br>
 other argument that God is not necessarily worshipped in a<br>
 particular spot" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. <B>{According to the figure}</B> <b><i>(\kata ton<br>
 tupon\)</i></b>. According to the type or pattern. \Tupos\ is from<br>
 \tupt&#333;\, to strike, to smite, and is the print of the blow <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 20:25)</i></b>, then the figure formed by a blow or impression like our<br>
 type, a model or example. Quoted from <!-#-->Ex 25:40. Common word in<br>
 the old Greek. <B>{That he had seen}</B> <b><i>(\hon he&#333;rakei\)</i></b>. Past perfect<br>
 active of \hora&#333;\, to see <b><i>(double reduplication)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:45 <B>{Which}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;n\)</i></b>. Agreeing with \sk&#275;n&#275;n\, not with \tupon\.<br>
 <B>{In their turn}</B> <b><i>(\diadexamenoi\)</i></b>. First aorist middle participle<br>
 of \diadechomai\, to receive through another, to receive in<br>
 sucession or in turn. Late Greek, only here in N.T. Deissmann<br>
 <b><i>(_Bible Studies_, p. 115)</i></b> argues from a second century B.C.<br>
 papyrus that \diadochos\ means rather deputy or court official<br>
 than successor. <B>{With Joshua}</B> <b><i>(\meta I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. With Jesus, the<br>
 Greek form of Joshua <b><i>(contracted from Jehoshua, <!-#-->Mt 1:21)</i></b>, as in<br>
 <!-#-->Heb 4:8. <B>{When they entered on the possession of the nations}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\en t&#275;i kataschesei t&#333;n ethn&#333;n\)</i></b>. Literally "in <b><i>(or at the time<br>
 of)</i></b> the possession of the nations." See on &#175;7:5 for the only<br>
 other N.T. instance of \kataschesis\. <B>{Which}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;n\)</i></b>. The<br>
 nations, genitive by attraction to case of \ethn&#333;n\. <B>{Thrust out}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ex&#333;sen\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of \ex&#333;the&#333;\, to push<br>
 out, common verb, here, only in N.T. save some MSS. in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 27:39.<br>
 <br>
 7:46 <B>{Asked}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;it&#275;sato\)</i></b>. Aorist middle <b><i>(indirect)</i></b> indicative,<br>
 asked for himself <b><i>(as a favour to himself)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->2Sa 7:2f. <B>{A<br>
 habitation}</B> <b><i>(\sk&#275;n&#333;ma\)</i></b>. Like <!-#-->Ps 132:5, but it was a house that<br>
 David proposed to build <b><i>(<!-#-->2Sa 7:2)</i></b>, not a tent <b><i>(\sk&#275;n&#275;\)</i></b> which<br>
 already existed. \Sk&#275;n&#333;ma\ here means a more permanent abode<br>
 <b><i>(\oikon\, house, in verse <!-#-->47)</i></b>, though from the same root as<br>
 \sk&#275;n&#275;\.<br>
 <br>
 7:48 <B>{Howbeit}</B> <b><i>(\all'\)</i></b>. By contrast with what Solomon did and<br>
 David planned. Note emphatic position of "not" <b><i>(\all' ouch\)</i></b>,<br>
 "But not does the Most High dwell." The presence of the Most High<br>
 is not confined in any building, even one so splendid as<br>
 Solomon's Temple as Solomon himself foresaw and acknowledged in<br>
 his prayer <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ki 8:27; 2Ch 6:18)</i></b>. <B>{In houses made with hands}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\en cheiropoi&#275;tois\)</i></b>. No word here for "houses" or "temples" in<br>
 correct text <b><i>(\naois\ temples in Textus Receptus)</i></b>. Literally, "In<br>
 things made with hands" <b><i>(\cheir\, hand, \poi&#275;tos\, verbal<br>
 adjective of \poie&#333;\)</i></b>. It occurs in <!-#-->Mr 14:58 of the temple and<br>
 of the sanctuary of Moab <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 16:12)</i></b>. It occurs also in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 7:24; Heb 9:11,24; Eph 2:11. Common in the old Greek. <B>{The<br>
 prophet}</B> <b><i>(\ho proph&#275;t&#275;s\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Isa 66:1. Isaiah taught plainly that<br>
 heaven is God's throne.<br>
 <br>
 7:49 <B>{What manner of house}</B> <b><i>(\Poion oikon\)</i></b>. What sort of a<br>
 house? This interrogative is sometimes scornful as in <!-#-->4:7; Lu<br>
 6:32ff. <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. So Stephen shows by Isaiah that Solomon was<br>
 right that the temple was not meant to "confine" God's presence<br>
 and that Jesus had rightly shown that God is a spirit and can be<br>
 worshipped anywhere by any individual of any race or land. It is<br>
 a tremendous argument for the universality and spirituality of<br>
 Christianity free from the shackles of Jewish racial and national<br>
 limitations, but its very strength only angered the Sanhedrin to<br>
 desperation.<br>
 <br>
 7:51 <B>{Stiffnecked}</B> <b><i>(\skl&#275;rotrach&#275;loi\)</i></b>. From \skl&#275;ros\ <b><i>(hard)</i></b> and<br>
 \trach&#275;los\, neck, both old words, but this compound only in the<br>
 LXX and here alone in the N.T. Critics assume that Stephen was<br>
 interrupted at this point because of the sharp tone of the<br>
 speech. That may be true, but the natural climax is sufficient<br>
 explanation. <B>{Uncircumcised in heart}</B> <b><i>(\aperitm&#275;toi kardiais\)</i></b>.<br>
 Late adjective common in LXX and here only in the N.T. Verbal of<br>
 \peritemn&#333;\, to cut around and \a\ privative. Both of these<br>
 epithets are applied to the Jews in the O.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 32:9; 33:3,5;<br>
 34:9; Le 26:41; De 9:6; Jer 6:10)</i></b>. \Kardiais\ is locative plural<br>
 like \&#333;sin\ <b><i>(ears)</i></b>, but some MSS. have genitive singular<br>
 \kardias\ <b><i>(objective genitive)</i></b>. No epithet could have been more<br>
 galling to these Pharisees than to be turned "uncircumcised in<br>
 heart" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 2:29)</i></b>. They had only the physical circumcision which<br>
 was useless. <B>{Ye always}</B> <b><i>(\humeis aei\)</i></b>. Emphatic position of<br>
 humeis and "always" looks backward over the history of their<br>
 forefathers which Stephen had reviewed. <B>{Resist}</B> <b><i>(\antipiptete\)</i></b>.<br>
 Old word to fall against, to rush against. Only here in the N.T.,<br>
 but used in the O.T. which is here quoted <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 27:14)</i></b>. Their<br>
 fathers had made "external worship a substitute for spiritual<br>
 obedience" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. Stephen has shown how God had revealed<br>
 himself gradually, the revelation sloping upward to Christ Jesus.<br>
 "And as he saw his countrymen repeating the old mistake--clinging<br>
 to the present and the material, while God was calling them to<br>
 higher spiritual levels--and still, as ever, resisting the Holy<br>
 Spirit, treating the Messiah as the patriarchs had treated<br>
 Joseph, and the Hebrews Moses--the pity of it overwhelmed him,<br>
 and his mingled grief and indignation broke out in words of fire,<br>
 such as burned of old on the lips of the prophets" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
 Stephen, the accused, is now the accuser, and the situation<br>
 becomes intolerable to the Sanhedrin.<br>
 <br>
 7:52 <B>{Which of the prophets}</B> <b><i>(\tina t&#333;n proph&#275;t&#333;n\)</i></b>. Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 11:47; Mt 23:29-37)</i></b> had charged them with this very thing. Cf.<br>
 <!-#-->2Ch 36:16. <B>{Which shewed before}</B> <b><i>(\prokataggeilantas\)</i></b>. The<br>
 very prophets who foretold the coming of the Messiah their<br>
 fathers killed. <B>{The coming}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;s eleuse&#333;s\)</i></b>. Not in ancient<br>
 Greek or LXX and only here in the N.T. <b><i>(in a few late writers)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Betrayers}</B> <b><i>(\prodotai\)</i></b>. Just like Judas Iscariot. He hurled<br>
 this old biting word at them. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 6:16;<br>
 2Ti 3:4. It cut like a knife. It is blunter than Peter in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 3:13. <B>{Murderers}</B> <b><i>(\phoneis\)</i></b>. The climax with this sharp word<br>
 used of Barabbas <b><i>(<!-#-->3:14)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:53 <B>{Ye who}</B> <b><i>(\hoitines\)</i></b>. The very ones who, _quippe qui_,<br>
 often in Acts when the persons are enlarged upon <b><i>(<!-#-->8:15; 9:35;<br>
 10:41,47)</i></b>. <B>{As it was ordained by angels}</B> <b><i>(\eis diatagas<br>
 aggel&#333;n\)</i></b>. About angels see on &#175;7:38. \Diatag&#275;\ <b><i>(from<br>
 \diatass&#333;\, to arrange, appoint)</i></b> occurs in late Greek, LXX,<br>
 inscriptions, papyri, Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient East_,<br>
 pp. 89ff., and in N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ro 13:2. At <b><i>(or as)</i></b> the<br>
 appointment of angels <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mt 10:41; 12:41 for this use of<br>
 \eis\)</i></b>. <B>{And kept it not}</B> <b><i>(\kai ouk ephulaxate\)</i></b>. Like a<br>
 whipcracker these words cut to the quick. They gloried in<br>
 possessing the law and openly violated it <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 2:23)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:54 <B>{When they heard}</B> <b><i>(\akouontes\)</i></b>. Present active participle<br>
 of \akou&#333;\, while hearing. <B>{They were cut to the heart}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dieprionto tais kardiais\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->5:33 where the same word and<br>
 form <b><i>(imperfect passive of \diapri&#333;\)</i></b> is used of the effect of<br>
 Peter's speech on the Sadducees. Here Stephen had sent a saw<br>
 through the hearts of the Pharisees that rasped them to the bone.<br>
 <B>{They gnashed on him with their teeth}</B> <b><i>(\ebruchon tous odontas<br>
 ep' auton\)</i></b>. Imperfect <b><i>(inchoative)</i></b> active of \bruch&#333;\ <b><i>(Attic<br>
 \bruk&#333;\)</i></b>, to bite with loud noise, to grind or gnash the teeth.<br>
 Literally, They began to gnash their teeth at <b><i>(\ep'\)</i></b> him <b><i>(just<br>
 like a pack of hungry, snarling wolves)</i></b>. Stephen knew that it<br>
 meant death for him.<br>
 <br>
 7:55 <B>{And Jesus standing}</B> <b><i>(\kai I&#275;soun hest&#333;ta\)</i></b>. Full of the<br>
 Holy Spirit, gazing steadfastly into heaven, he saw God's glory<br>
 and Jesus "standing" as if he had risen to cheer the brave<br>
 Stephen. Elsewhere <b><i>(save verse <!-#-->56 also)</i></b> he is pictured as<br>
 sitting at the right hand of God <b><i>(the Session of Christ)</i></b> as in<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 26:64; Mr 16:19; Ac 2:34; Eph 1:20; Col 3:1; Heb 1:3.<br>
 <br>
 7:56 <B>{Opened}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;noigmenous\)</i></b>. Perfect passive predicate<br>
 participle of \dianoignumi\ <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mt 3:16; Lu 3:21)</i></b>. <B>{The son of<br>
 man}</B> <b><i>(\ton huion tou anthr&#333;pou\)</i></b>. Elsewhere in the N.T. in<br>
 Christ's own words. Here Stephen may refer to the words of Jesus<br>
 as preserved in <!-#-->Mt 26:64.<br>
 <br>
 7:57 <B>{Stopped their ears}</B> <b><i>(\suneschon ta &#333;ta aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active of \sunech&#333;\, to hold together. They held their<br>
 ears together with their hands and affected to believe Stephen<br>
 guilty of blasphemy <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mt 26:65)</i></b>. <B>{Rushed upon him with one<br>
 accord}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;rm&#275;san homothumadon ep' auton\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist<br>
 active indicative of \horma&#333;\, to rush impetuously as the hogs<br>
 did down the cliff when the demons entered them <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:33)</i></b>. No<br>
 vote was taken by the Sanhedrin. No scruple was raised about not<br>
 having the right to put him to death <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 8:31)</i></b>. It may have<br>
 taken place after Pilate's recall and before his successor came<br>
 or Pilate, if there, just connived at such an incident that did<br>
 not concern Rome. At any rate it was mob violence like modern<br>
 lynching that took the law into the hands of the Sanhedrin<br>
 without further formalities. <B>{Out of the city}</B> <b><i>(\ek t&#275;s pole&#333;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 To keep from defiling the place with blood. But they sought to<br>
 kill Paul as soon as they got him out of the temple area <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 21:30f.)</i></b>. <B>{Stoned}</B> <b><i>(\elithoboloun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active indicative<br>
 of \lithobole&#333;\, began to stone, from \lithobolos\ <b><i>(\lithos\,<br>
 stone, \ball&#333;\, to throw)</i></b>, late Greek verb, several times in the<br>
 N.T. as <!-#-->Lu 13:34. Stoning was the Jewish punishment for<br>
 blasphemy <b><i>(<!-#-->Le 24:14-16)</i></b>. <B>{The witnesses}</B> <b><i>(\hoi martures\)</i></b>. The<br>
 false testifiers against Stephen suborned by the Pharisees <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 6:11,13)</i></b>. These witnesses had the privilege of casting the first<br>
 stones <b><i>(<!-#-->De 13:10; 17:7)</i></b> against the first witness for Christ<br>
 with death <b><i>(_martyr_ in our modern sense of the word)</i></b>. <B>{At the<br>
 feet of a young man named Saul}</B> <b><i>(\para tous podas neaniou<br>
 kaloumenou Saulou\)</i></b>. Beside <b><i>(\para\)</i></b> the feet. Our first<br>
 introduction to the man who became the greatest of all followers<br>
 of Jesus Christ. Evidently he was not one of the "witnesses"<br>
 against Stephen, for he was throwing no stones at him. But<br>
 evidently he was already a leader in the group of Pharisees. We<br>
 know from later hints from Saul <b><i>(Paul)</i></b> himself that he had been a<br>
 pupil of Gamaliel <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 22:3)</i></b>. Gamaliel, as the Pharisaic leader<br>
 in the Sanhedrin, was probably on hand to hear the accusations<br>
 against Stephen by the Pharisees. But, if so, he does not raise<br>
 his voice against this mob violence. Saul does not seem to be<br>
 aware that he is going contrary to the views of his master,<br>
 though pupils often go further than their teachers.<br>
 <br>
 7:59 <B>{They stoned}</B> <b><i>(\elithoboloun\)</i></b>. Same verb and tense<br>
 repeated, they kept on stoning, they kept it up as he was calling<br>
 upon the Lord Jesus and making direct prayer to him as "Lord<br>
 Jesus" <b><i>(\Kurie I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. <B>{Receive my spirit}</B> <b><i>(\dexai to pneuma<br>
 mou\)</i></b>. Aorist middle imperative, urgency, receive it now. Many<br>
 have followed Stephen into death with these words upon their<br>
 dying lips. See, <!-#-->9:14,21; 22:16.<br>
 <br>
 7:60 <B>{Kneeled down}</B> <b><i>(\theis ta gonata\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \tith&#275;mi\, placing the knees <b><i>(on the ground)</i></b>. This<br>
 idiom is not in the old Greek for kneeling, but Luke has it five<br>
 times <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:41; Ac 7:60; 9:40; 22:36; 21:5)</i></b> and Mark once<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->15:19)</i></b>. Jesus was standing at the right hand of God and<br>
 Stephen knelt before him in worship and called on him in prayer.<br>
 <B>{Lay not this sin to their charge}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; st&#275;s&#275;is autois taut&#275;n t&#275;n<br>
 hamartian\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active subjunctive with<br>
 \m&#275;\, regular Greek idiom, Place not to them or against them<br>
 <b><i>(dative \autois\)</i></b> this sin. The very spirit of Jesus towards his<br>
 enemies as he died upon the Cross <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:34)</i></b>. <B>{He fell asleep}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ekoim&#275;th&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of \koima&#333;\, to<br>
 put to sleep. Old verb and the metaphor of sleep for death is<br>
 common in all languages, but it is peculiarly appropriate here as<br>
 Jesus used it of Lazarus. See also <!-#-->Ac 13:36; 1Co 15:18, etc.<br>
 Our word cemetery <b><i>(\koim&#275;t&#275;rion\)</i></b> is the sleeping place of the<br>
 dead. Knowling calls \ekoim&#275;th&#275;\ here "a picture word of rest and<br>
 calmness which stands in dramatic contrast to the rage and<br>
 violence of the scene."<br>
