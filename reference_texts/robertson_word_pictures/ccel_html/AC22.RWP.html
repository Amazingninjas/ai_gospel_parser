<p>22:1 <B>{Brethren and fathers}</B> <b><i>(\Andres adelphoi kai pateres\)</i></b> Men,<br>
 brethren, and fathers. The very language used by Stephen <b><i>(<!-#-->7:2)</i></b><br>
 when arraigned before the Sanhedrin with Paul then present. Now<br>
 Paul faces a Jewish mob on the same charges brought against<br>
 Stephen. These words are those of courtesy and dignity <b><i>(_amoris<br>
 et honoris nomina_, Page)</i></b>. These men were Paul's brother Jews and<br>
 were <b><i>(many of them)</i></b> official representatives of the people<br>
 <b><i>(Sanhedrists, priests, rabbis)</i></b>. Paul's purpose is conciliatory,<br>
 he employs "his ready tact" <b><i>(Rackham)</i></b>. <B>{The defence which I now<br>
 make unto you}</B> <b><i>(\mou t&#275;s pros humas nuni apologias\)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 My defence to you at this time. \Nuni\ is a sharpened form <b><i>(by<br>
 \-i\)</i></b> of \nun\ <b><i>(now)</i></b>, just now. The term \apologia\ <b><i>(apology)</i></b> is<br>
 not our use of the word for apologizing for an offence, but the<br>
 original sense of defence for his conduct, his life. It is an old<br>
 word from \apologeomai\, to talk oneself off a charge, to make<br>
 defence. It occurs also in <!-#-->Ac 25:16 and then also in <!-#-->1Co 9:3;<br>
 2Co 7:11; Php 1:7,16; 2Ti 4:16; 1Pe 3:15. Paul uses it again in<br>
 <!-#-->Ac 25:16 as here about his defence against the charges made by<br>
 the Jews from Asia. He is suspected of being a renegade from the<br>
 Mosaic law and charged with specific acts connected with the<br>
 alleged profanation of the temple. So Paul speaks in Aramaic and<br>
 recites the actual facts connected with his change from Judaism<br>
 to Christianity. The facts make the strongest argument. He first<br>
 recounts the well-known story of his zeal for Judaism in the<br>
 persecution of the Christians and shows why the change came. Then<br>
 he gives a summary of his work among the Gentiles and why he came<br>
 to Jerusalem this time. He answers the charge of enmity to the<br>
 people and the law and of desecration of the temple. It is a<br>
 speech of great skill and force, delivered under remarkable<br>
 conditions. The one in chapter <!-#-->Ac 26 covers some of the same<br>
 ground, but for a slightly different purpose as we shall see. For<br>
 a discussion of the three reports in Acts of Paul's conversion<br>
 see chapter <!-#-->Ac 9. Luke has not been careful to make every<br>
 detail correspond, though there is essential agreement in all<br>
 three.<br>
 <br>
 22:2 <B>{He spake}</B> <b><i>(\proseph&#333;nei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, was speaking.<br>
 See aorist active \proseph&#333;n&#275;sen\ in <!-#-->21:40. <B>{They were the more<br>
 quiet}</B> <b><i>(\m&#257;llon pareschon h&#275;suchian\)</i></b>. Literally, The more<br>
 <b><i>(\m&#257;llon\)</i></b> they furnished or supplied <b><i>(second aorist active<br>
 indicative of \parech&#333;\)</i></b> quietness <b><i>(\h&#275;suchian\, old word, in the<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->2Th 3:12; 1Ti 2:11ff.)</i></b>. Precisely this idiom<br>
 occurs in Plutarch <b><i>(_Cor_. 18)</i></b> and the LXX <b><i>(<!-#-->Job 34:29)</i></b>.<br>
 Knowling notes the fondness of Luke for words of silence <b><i>(\sig&#275;,<br>
 siga&#333;, h&#275;suchaz&#333;\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Lu 14:4; 15:26; Ac 11:18; 12:17; 15:12;<br>
 21:14,40. It is a vivid picture of the sudden hush that swept<br>
 over the vast mob under the spell of the Aramaic. They would have<br>
 understood Paul's _Koin&#275;_ Greek, but they much preferred the<br>
 Aramaic. It was a masterstroke.<br>
 <br>
 22:3 <B>{I am a Jew}</B> <b><i>(\Eg&#333; eimi an&#275;r Ioudaios\)</i></b>. Note use of \Eg&#333;\<br>
 for emphasis. Paul recounts his Jewish advantages or privileges<br>
 with manifest pride as in <!-#-->Ac 26:4f.; 2Co 11:22; Ga 1:14; Php<br>
 3:4-7. <B>{Born}</B> <b><i>(\gegenn&#275;menos\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of<br>
 \genna&#333;\. See above in <!-#-->21:39 for the claim of Tarsus as his<br>
 birth-place. He was a Hellenistic Jew, not an Aramaean Jew <b><i>(cf.<br>
 <!-#-->Ac 6:1)</i></b>. <B>{Brought up}</B> <b><i>(\anatethrammenos\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle again of \anatreph&#333;\, to nurse up, to nourish up,<br>
 common old verb, but in the N.T. only here, <!-#-->7:20ff., and MSS.<br>
 in <!-#-->Lu 4:16. The implication is that Paul was sent to Jerusalem<br>
 while still young, "from my youth" <b><i>(<!-#-->26:4)</i></b>, how young we do not<br>
 know, possibly thirteen or fourteen years old. He apparently had<br>
 not seen Jesus in the flesh <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 5:16)</i></b>. <B>{At the feet of<br>
 Gamaliel}</B> <b><i>(\pros tous podas Gamali&#275;l\)</i></b>. The rabbis usually sat on<br>
 a raised seat with the pupils in a circle around either on lower<br>
 seats or on the ground. Paul was thus nourished in Pharisaic<br>
 Judaism as interpreted by Gamaliel, one of the lights of Judaism.<br>
 For remarks on Gamaliel see chapter <!-#-->5:34ff. He was one of the<br>
 seven Rabbis to whom the Jews gave the highest title \Rabban\<br>
 <b><i>(our Rabbi)</i></b>. \Rabbi\ <b><i>(my teacher)</i></b> was next, the lowest being<br>
 \Rab\ <b><i>(teacher)</i></b>. "As Aquinas among the schoolmen was called<br>
 _Doctor Angelicus_, and Bonaventura _Doctor Seraphicus_, so<br>
 Gamaliel was called _the Beauty of the Law_" <b><i>(Conybeare and<br>
 Howson)</i></b>. <B>{Instructed}</B> <b><i>(\pepaideumenos\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle again <b><i>(each participle beginning a clause)</i></b>, this time<br>
 of \paideu&#333;\, old verb to train a child <b><i>(\pais\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->7:22<br>
 which see. In this sense also in <!-#-->1Ti 1:20; Tit 2:12. Then to<br>
 chastise as in <!-#-->Lu 23:16,22 <b><i>(which see)</i></b>; <!-#-->2Ti 2:25; Heb 12:6f.<br>
 <B>{According to the strict manner}</B> <b><i>(\kata akribeian\)</i></b>. Old word,<br>
 only here in N.T. Mathematical accuracy, minute exactness as seen<br>
 in the adjective in <!-#-->26:5. See also <!-#-->Ro 10:2; Gal 1:4; Php<br>
 3:4-7. <B>{Of our fathers}</B> <b><i>(\patr&#333;iou\)</i></b>. Old adjective from<br>
 \pater\, only here and <!-#-->24:14 in N.T. Means descending from<br>
 father to son, especially property and other inherited<br>
 privileges. \Patrikos\ <b><i>(patrician)</i></b> refers more to personal<br>
 attributes and affiliations. <B>{Being zealous for God}</B> <b><i>(\z&#275;l&#333;t&#275;s<br>
 huparch&#333;n tou theou\)</i></b>. Not adjective, but substantive <B>{zealot}</B><br>
 <b><i>(same word used by James of the thousands of Jewish Christians in<br>
 Jerusalem, <!-#-->21:20 which see)</i></b> with objective genitive \tou theou\<br>
 <b><i>(for God)</i></b>. See also verse <!-#-->14; 28:17; 2Ti 1:3 where he makes a<br>
 similar claim. So did Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 3:13; 5:30)</i></b> and Stephen<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->7:32)</i></b>. Paul definitely claims, whatever freedom he demanded<br>
 for Gentile Christians, to be personally "a zealot for God" "even<br>
 as ye all are this day" <b><i>(\kath&#333;s pantes humeis este s&#275;meron\)</i></b>. In<br>
 his conciliation he went to the limit and puts himself by the<br>
 side of the mob in their zeal for the law, mistaken as they were<br>
 about him. He was generous surely to interpret their fanatical<br>
 frenzy as zeal for God. But Paul is sincere as he proceeds to<br>
 show by appeal to his own conduct.<br>
 <br>
 22:4 <B>{And I}</B> <b><i>(\hos\)</i></b>. <B>{I who}</B>, literally. <B>{This Way}</B> <b><i>(\taut&#275;n t&#275;n<br>
 hodon\)</i></b>. The very term used for Christianity by Luke concerning<br>
 Paul's persecution <b><i>(<!-#-->9:2)</i></b>, which see. Here it "avoids any<br>
 irritating name for the Christian body" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b> by using this<br>
 Jewish terminology. <B>{Unto the death}</B> <b><i>(\achri thanatou\)</i></b>. Unto<br>
 death, actual death of many as <!-#-->26:10 shows. <B>{Both men and<br>
 women}</B> <b><i>(\andras te kai gunaikas\)</i></b>. Paul felt ashamed of this fact<br>
 and it was undoubtedly in his mind when he pictured his former<br>
 state as "a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti<br>
 1:13)</i></b>, the first of sinners" <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 1:15)</i></b>. But it showed the<br>
 lengths to which Paul went in his zeal for Judaism.<br>
 <br>
 22:5 <B>{Doth bear me witness}</B> <b><i>(\marturei moi\)</i></b>. Present active<br>
 indicative as if still living. Caiaphas was no longer high priest<br>
 now, for Ananias is at this time <b><i>(<!-#-->23:2)</i></b>, though he may be still<br>
 alive. <B>{All the estate of the elders}</B> <b><i>(\pan to presbuterion\)</i></b>.<br>
 All the eldership or the Sanhedrin <b><i>(<!-#-->4:5)</i></b> of which Paul was<br>
 probably then a member <b><i>(<!-#-->26:10)</i></b>. Possibly some of those present<br>
 were members of the Sanhedrin then <b><i>(some 20 odd years ago)</i></b>. <B>{From<br>
 whom}</B> <b><i>(\par' h&#333;n\)</i></b>. The high priest and the Sanhedrin. <B>{Letters<br>
 unto the brethren}</B> <b><i>(\epistalas pros tous adelphous\)</i></b>. Paul still<br>
 can tactfully call the Jews his "brothers" as he did in <!-#-->Ro 9:3.<br>
 There is no bitterness in his heart. <B>{Journeyed}</B> <b><i>(\eporeuom&#275;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect middle indicative of \poreuomai\, and a vivid reality<br>
 to Paul still as he was going on towards Damascus. <B>{To bring<br>
 also}</B> <b><i>(\ax&#333;n kai\)</i></b>. Future active participle of \ag&#333;\, to express<br>
 purpose, one of the few N.T. examples of this classic idiom<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1118)</i></b>. <B>{Them which were there}</B> <b><i>(\tous<br>
 ekeise ontas\)</i></b>. _Constructio praegnans_. The usual word would be<br>
 \ekei\ <b><i>(there)</i></b>, not \ekeise\ <b><i>(thither)</i></b>. Possibly the Christians<br>
 who had fled to Damascus, and so were there <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 548)</i></b>. <B>{In bonds}</B> <b><i>(\dedemenous\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle of \de&#333;\, predicate position, "bound." <B>{For to be<br>
 punished}</B> <b><i>(\hina tim&#333;r&#275;th&#333;sin\)</i></b>. First aorist passive subjunctive<br>
 of \tim&#333;re&#333;\, old verb to avenge, to take vengeance on. In the<br>
 N.T. only here, and <!-#-->26:11. Pure final clause with \hina\. He<br>
 carried his persecution outside of Palestine just as later he<br>
 carried the gospel over the Roman empire.<br>
 <br>
 22:6 <B>{And it came to pass}</B> <b><i>(\egeneto de\)</i></b>. Rather than the common<br>
 \kai egeneto\ and with the infinitive <b><i>(\periastrapsai\)</i></b>, one of<br>
 the three constructions with \kai <b><i>(de)</i></b> egeneto\ by Luke<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 1042f.)</i></b>, followed by \kai\, by finite<br>
 verb, by subject infinitive as here. <B>{As I made my journey}</B> <b><i>(\moi<br>
 poreuomen&#333;i\)</i></b>. To me <b><i>(dative after \egeneto\, happened to me)</i></b><br>
 journeying <b><i>(participle agreeing with \moi\)</i></b>. See this same idiom<br>
 in verse <!-#-->17. Luke uses \egeneto de\ seventeen times in the<br>
 gospel and twenty-one in the Acts. <B>{Unto Damascus}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i<br>
 Damask&#333;i\)</i></b>. Dative after \eggizonti\ <b><i>(drawing nigh to)</i></b>. <B>{About<br>
 noon}</B> <b><i>(\peri mes&#275;mbrian\)</i></b>. Mid <b><i>(\mesos\)</i></b> day <b><i>(\h&#275;mera\)</i></b>, old<br>
 word, in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->8:26 which see where it may<br>
 mean "toward the south." An item not in ch. 9. <B>{Shone round about<br>
 me}</B> <b><i>(\periastrapsai peri eme\)</i></b>. First aorist active infinitive of<br>
 \periastrapt&#333;\, to flash around, in LXX and late Greek, in the<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->9:3 which see. Note repetition of \peri\. <B>{A<br>
 great light}</B> <b><i>(\ph&#333;s hikanon\)</i></b>. Luke's favourite word \hikanon\<br>
 <b><i>(considerable)</i></b>. Accusative of general reference with the<br>
 infinitive.<br>
 <br>
 22:7 <B>{I fell}</B> <b><i>(\epesa\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative with<br>
 \-a\ rather than \epeson\, the usual form of \pipt&#333;\. <B>{Unto the<br>
 ground}</B> <b><i>(\eis to edaphos\)</i></b>. Old word, here alone in N.T. So the<br>
 verb \edaphiz&#333;\, is in <!-#-->Lu 19:44 alone in the N.T. <B>{A voice<br>
 saying}</B> <b><i>(\ph&#333;n&#275;s legous&#275;s\)</i></b>. Genitive after \&#275;kousa\, though in<br>
 <!-#-->26:14 the accusative is used after \&#275;kousa\, as in <!-#-->22:14<br>
 after \akousai\, either being allowable. See on &#175;9:7 for<br>
 discussion of the difference in case. Saul's name repeated each<br>
 time <b><i>(<!-#-->9:4; 22:7; 26:14)</i></b>. Same question also in each report:<br>
 "Why persecuted thou me?" <b><i>(\Ti me di&#333;keis?\)</i></b>. These piercing<br>
 words stuck in Paul's mind.<br>
 <br>
 22:8 <B>{Of Nazareth}</B> <b><i>(\ho Naz&#333;raios\)</i></b>. The Nazarene, not in <!-#-->9:5;<br>
 26:15 and here because Jesus is mentioned now for the first time<br>
 in the address. The form \Naz&#333;raios\ as in <!-#-->Mt 2:23 <b><i>(which see)</i></b><br>
 is used also in <!-#-->24:5 for the followers of Jesus instead of<br>
 \Nazar&#275;nos\ as in <!-#-->Mr 1:24, etc. <b><i>(which see)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:9 <B>{But they heard not the voice}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n de ph&#333;n&#275;n ouk<br>
 &#275;kousan\)</i></b>. The accusative here may be used rather than the<br>
 genitive as in verse <!-#-->7 to indicate that those with Paul did not<br>
 understand what they heard <b><i>(<!-#-->9:7)</i></b> just as they beheld the light<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->22:9)</i></b>, but did not see Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->9:7)</i></b>. The difference in cases<br>
 allows this distinction, though it is not always observed as just<br>
 noticed about <!-#-->22:14; 26:14. The verb \akou&#333;\ is used in the<br>
 sense of understand <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 4:33; 1Co 14:2)</i></b>. It is one of the<br>
 evidences of the genuineness of this report of Paul's speech that<br>
 Luke did not try to smooth out apparent discrepancies in details<br>
 between the words of Paul and his own record already in ch. 9.<br>
 The Textus Receptus adds in this verse: "And they became afraid"<br>
 <b><i>(\kai emphoboi egenonto\)</i></b>. Clearly not genuine.<br>
 <br>
 22:10 <B>{Into Damascus}</B> <b><i>(\eis Damaskon\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->9:6 simply "into the<br>
 city" <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n polin\)</i></b>. <B>{Of all things which}</B> <b><i>(\peri pant&#333;n<br>
 h&#333;n\)</i></b>. \H&#333;n\, relative plural attracted to genitive of antecedent<br>
 from accusative \ha\, object of \poi&#275;sai\ <b><i>(do)</i></b>. <B>{Are appointed<br>
 for thee}</B> <b><i>(\tetaktai soi\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative of<br>
 \tass&#333;\, to appoint, to order, with dative \soi\. Compare with<br>
 \hoti se dei\ of <!-#-->9:6. The words were spoken to Paul, of course,<br>
 in the Aramaic, Saoul, Saoul.<br>
 <br>
 22:11 <B>{I could not see}</B> <b><i>(\ouk eneblepon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of<br>
 \emblep&#333;\, I was not seeing, same fact stated in <!-#-->9:8. Here the<br>
 reason as "for the glory of that light" <b><i>(\apo t&#275;s dox&#275;s tou<br>
 ph&#333;tos ekeinou\)</i></b>. <B>{Being led by the hand}</B> <b><i>(\cheirag&#333;goumenos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present passive participle of \cheirag&#333;ge&#333;\, the same verb used<br>
 in <!-#-->9:8 <b><i>(\cheirag&#333;gountes\)</i></b> which see. Late verb, in the N.T.<br>
 only in these two places. In LXX.<br>
 <br>
 22:12 <B>{A devout man according to the law}</B> <b><i>(\eulab&#275;s kata ton<br>
 nomon\)</i></b>. See on &#175;2:5; 8:2; Lu 2:25 for the adjective \eulab&#275;s\.<br>
 Paul adds "according to the law" to show that he was introduced<br>
 to Christianity by a devout Jew and no law-breaker <b><i>(Lewin)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:13 <B>{I looked up on him}</B> <b><i>(\anablepsa eis auton\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active indicative and same word as \anablepson\ <b><i>(Receive thy<br>
 sight)</i></b>. Hence here the verb means as the margin of the Revised<br>
 Version has it: "I received my sight and looked upon him." For<br>
 "look up" see <!-#-->Joh 9:11.<br>
 <br>
 22:14 <B>{Hath appointed thee}</B> <b><i>(\proecheirisato\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 middle indicative of \procheiriz&#333;\, old verb to put forth into<br>
 one's hands, to take into one's hands beforehand, to plan,<br>
 propose, determine. In the N.T. only in <!-#-->Ac 3:20; 22:14; 26:16.<br>
 Three infinitives after this verb of God's purpose about Paul:<br>
 <B>{to know}</B> <b><i>(\gn&#333;nai\, second aorist active of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b> his will,<br>
 <B>{to see}</B> <b><i>(\idein\, second aorist active of \hora&#333;\)</i></b> the Righteous<br>
 One <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->3:14)</i></b>, <B>{to hear}</B> <b><i>(\akousai\, first aorist active of<br>
 \akou&#333;\)</i></b> a voice from his mouth.<br>
 <br>
 22:15 <B>{A witness for him}</B> <b><i>(\martus aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->1:8. <B>{Of<br>
 what}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;n\)</i></b>. Attraction of the accusative relative \ha\ to the<br>
 genitive case of the unexpressed antecedent \tout&#333;n\. <B>{Thou hast<br>
 seen and heard}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;rakas\, present perfect active indicative<br>
 \kai &#275;kousas\, first aorist active indicative)</i></b>. This subtle<br>
 change of tense is not preserved in the English. Blass properly<br>
 cites the perfect \he&#333;raka\ in <!-#-->1Co 9:1 as proof of Paul's<br>
 enduring qualification for the apostleship.<br>
 <br>
 22:16 <B>{By baptized}</B> <b><i>(\baptisai\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 <b><i>(causative)</i></b>, not passive, Get thyself baptized <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 808)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->1Co 10:2. Submit yourself to baptism.<br>
 So as to \apolousai\, Get washed off as in <!-#-->1Co 6:11. It is<br>
 possible, as in <!-#-->2:38, to take these words as teaching baptismal<br>
 remission or salvation by means of baptism, but to do so is in my<br>
 opinion a complete subversion of Paul's vivid and picturesque<br>
 language. As in <!-#-->Ro 6:4-6 where baptism is the picture of death,<br>
 burial and resurrection, so here baptism pictures the change that<br>
 had already taken place when Paul surrendered to Jesus on the way<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->10)</i></b>. Baptism here pictures the washing away of sins by<br>
 the blood of Christ.<br>
 <br>
 22:17 <B>{When I had returned}</B> <b><i>(\moi hupostrepsanti\)</i></b>, <B>{while I<br>
 prayed}</B> <b><i>(\proseuchomenou mou\)</i></b>, <B>{I fell}</B> <b><i>(\genesthai me\)</i></b>. Note<br>
 dative \moi\ with \egeneto\ as in verse <!-#-->6, genitive \mou\<br>
 <b><i>(genitive absolute with \proseuchomenou\)</i></b>, accusative of general<br>
 reference \me\ with \genesthai\, and with no effort at<br>
 uniformity, precisely as in <!-#-->15:22,23 which see. The participle<br>
 is especially liable to such examples of anacolutha <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 439)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:18 <B>{Saw him saying}</B> <b><i>(\idein auton legonta\)</i></b>. The first visit<br>
 after his conversion when they tried to kill him in Jerusalem<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->9:29)</i></b>. <B>{Because}</B> <b><i>(\dioti, dia\ and \hoti\)</i></b>, <B>{for that}</B>.<br>
 <br>
 22:19 <B>{Imprisoned and beat}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;m&#275;n phulakiz&#333;n kai der&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic imperfect active of \phulakiz&#333;\ <b><i>(LXX and late<br>
 _Koin&#275;_, here alone in the N.T.)</i></b> and \der&#333;\ <b><i>(old verb to skin, to<br>
 beat as in <!-#-->Mt 21:35 which see)</i></b>. <B>{In every synagogue}</B> <b><i>(\kata tas<br>
 sunagogas\)</i></b>. Up and down <b><i>(\kata\)</i></b> in the synagogues.<br>
 <br>
 22:20 <B>{Was shed}</B> <b><i>(\exechunneto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive of \ekchunn&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(see on &#175;Mt 23:35)</i></b>, was being shed. <B>{Witness}</B> <b><i>(\marturos\)</i></b>. And<br>
 "martyr" also as in <!-#-->Re 2:13; 17:6. Transition state for the<br>
 word here. <B>{I also was standing by}</B> <b><i>(\kai autos &#275;m&#275;n ephest&#333;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic second past perfect in form, but imperfect <b><i>(linear)</i></b><br>
 in sense since \hest&#333;s=histamenos\ <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b>. <B>{Consenting}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\suneudok&#333;n\)</i></b>. The very word used by Luke in <!-#-->Ac 8:1 about<br>
 Paul. _Koin&#275;_ word for being pleased at the same time with <b><i>(cf.<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 11:48)</i></b>. Paul adds here the item of "guarding the clothes of<br>
 those who were slaying <b><i>(\anairount&#333;n\ as in <!-#-->Lu 23:32; Ac 12:2)</i></b><br>
 him" <b><i>(Stephen)</i></b>. Paul recalls the very words of protest used by<br>
 him to Jesus. He did not like the idea of running away to save<br>
 his own life right where he had helped slay Stephen. He is<br>
 getting on dangerous ground.<br>
 <br>
 22:21 <B>{I will send thee forth far hence unto the Gentiles}</B> <b><i>(\Eg&#333;<br>
 eis ethn&#275; makran exapostel&#333; se\)</i></b>. Future active of the double<br>
 <b><i>(\ex\, out, \apo\, off or away)</i></b> compound of \exapostell&#333;\, common<br>
 word in the _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Lu 24:49)</i></b>. This is a repetition by<br>
 Jesus of the call given in Damascus through Ananias <b><i>(<!-#-->9:15)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul had up till now avoided the word Gentiles, but at last it<br>
 had to come, "the fatal word" <b><i>(Farrar)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:22 <B>{They gave him audience}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kouon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, they<br>
 kept on listening, at least with respectful attention. <B>{Unto this<br>
 word}</B> <b><i>(\achri toutou tou logou\)</i></b>. But "this word" was like a<br>
 spark in a powder magazine or a torch to an oil tank. The<br>
 explosion of pent-up indignation broke out instantly worse than<br>
 at first <b><i>(<!-#-->21:30)</i></b>. <B>{Away with such a fellow from the earth}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Aire apo t&#275;s g&#275;s ton toiouton\)</i></b>. They renew the cry with the<br>
 very words in <!-#-->21:36, but with "from the earth" for vehemence.<br>
 <B>{For it is not fit}</B> <b><i>(\ou gar kath&#275;ken\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of<br>
 \kath&#275;k&#333;\, old verb to come down to, to become, to fit. In the<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ro 1:28. The imperfect is a neat Greek idiom<br>
 for impatience about an obligation: It was not fitting, he ought<br>
 to have been put to death long ago. The obligation is conceived<br>
 as not lived up to like our "ought" <b><i>(past of owe)</i></b>. See Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 886.<br>
 <br>
 22:23 <B>{As they cried out}</B> <b><i>(\kraugazont&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute with present active participle of \kraugaz&#333;\, a rare<br>
 word in the old Greek from \kraug&#275;\ <b><i>(a cry)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 12:19.<br>
 Two other genitive absolutes here, \rhiptount&#333;n\ <b><i>(throwing off,<br>
 present active participle, frequent active variation of \rhipt&#333;\)</i></b><br>
 and \ballont&#333;n\ <b><i>(present active participle of \ball&#333;\, flinging)</i></b>.<br>
 These present participles give a lively picture of the<br>
 uncontrolled excitement of the mob in their spasm of wild rage.<br>
 <br>
 22:24 <B>{That he be examined by scourging}</B> <b><i>(\mastixin anetazesthai<br>
 auton\)</i></b>. The present passive infinitive of \anetaz&#333;\ in indirect<br>
 command after \eipas\ <b><i>(bidding)</i></b>. This verb does not occur in the<br>
 old Greek <b><i>(which used \exetaz&#333;\ as in <!-#-->Mt 2:8)</i></b>, first in the<br>
 LXX, in the N.T. only here and verse <!-#-->29, but Milligan and<br>
 Moulton's _Vocabulary_ quotes an Oxyrhynchus papyrus of A.D. 127<br>
 which has a prefect using the word directing government clerks to<br>
 "examine" <b><i>(\anetazein\)</i></b> documents and glue them together into<br>
 volumes <b><i>(\tomoi\)</i></b>. The word was evidently in use for such<br>
 purposes. It was a kind of "third degree" applied to Paul by the<br>
 use of scourges <b><i>(\mastixin\)</i></b>, instrumental plural of \mastix\,<br>
 old word for whip, as in <!-#-->Heb 11:36. But this way of beginning<br>
 an inquiry by torture <b><i>(inquisition)</i></b> was contrary to Roman law<br>
 <b><i>(Page)</i></b>: _Non esse a tormentis incipiendum, Divus Augustus<br>
 statuit_. <B>{That he might know}</B> <b><i>(\hina epign&#333;i\)</i></b>. Final clause<br>
 with \hina\ and second aorist active subjunctive of \epign&#333;sk&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(full knowledge)</i></b>. Lysias was as much in the dark as ever, for<br>
 Paul's speech had been in Aramaic and this second explosion was a<br>
 mystery to him like the first. <B>{They so shouted}</B> <b><i>(\houtos<br>
 epeph&#333;noun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active progressive imperfect had been so<br>
 shouting.<br>
 <br>
 22:25 <B>{When they had tied him up}</B> <b><i>(\hos proeteinan auton\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active indicative of \protein&#333;\, old verb to stretch<br>
 forward, only here in the N.T. Literally, "When they stretched<br>
 him forward." <B>{With the thongs}</B> <b><i>(\tois himasin\)</i></b>. If the<br>
 instrumental case of \himas\, old word for strap or thong <b><i>(for<br>
 sandals as <!-#-->Mr 1:7, or for binding criminals as here)</i></b>, then Paul<br>
 was bent forward and tied by the thongs to a post in front to<br>
 expose his back the better to the scourges. But \tois himasin\<br>
 may be dative case and then it would mean "for the lashes." In<br>
 either case it is a dreadful scene of terrorizing by the<br>
 chiliarch. <B>{Unto the centurion that stood by}</B> <b><i>(\pros ton hest&#333;ta<br>
 hekatontarchon\)</i></b>. He was simply carrying out the orders of the<br>
 chiliarch <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mt 27:54)</i></b>. Why had not Paul made protest before<br>
 this? <B>{Is it lawful?}</B> <b><i>(\ei exestin?\)</i></b>. This use of \ei\ in<br>
 indirect questions we have had before <b><i>(<!-#-->1:6)</i></b>. <B>{A Roman and<br>
 uncondemned}</B> <b><i>(\Romaion kai akatakriton\)</i></b>. Just as in <!-#-->16:37<br>
 which see. Blass says of Paul's question: _Interrogatio<br>
 subironica est confidentiae plena_.<br>
 <br>
 22:26 <B>{What art thou about to do?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti melleis poiein?\)</i></b>. On the<br>
 point of doing, sharp warning.<br>
 <br>
 22:27 <B>{Art thou a Roman?}</B> <b><i>(\Su Romaios ei?\)</i></b>. <B>{Thou}</B> <b><i>(emphatic<br>
 position)</i></b> a Roman? It was unbelievable.<br>
 <br>
 22:28 <B>{With a great sum}</B> <b><i>(\pollou kephalaiou\)</i></b>. The use of<br>
 \kephalaiou\ <b><i>(from \kephal&#275;\, head)</i></b> for sums of money <b><i>(principal<br>
 as distinct from interest)</i></b> is old and frequent in the papyri. Our<br>
 word capital is from \caput\ <b><i>(head)</i></b>. The genitive is used here<br>
 according to rule for price. "The sale of the Roman citizenship<br>
 was resorted to by the emperors as a means of filling the<br>
 exchequer, much as James I. made baronets" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. Dio Cassius<br>
 <b><i>(LX., 17)</i></b> tells about Messalina the wife of Claudius selling<br>
 Roman citizenship. Lysias was probably a Greek and so had to buy<br>
 his citizenship. <B>{But I am a Roman born}</B> <b><i>(\Eg&#333; de kai<br>
 gegenn&#275;mai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative of \genna&#333;\. The word<br>
 "Roman" not in the Greek. Literally, "But I have been even born<br>
 one," <b><i>(i.e. born a Roman citizen)</i></b>. There is calm and simple<br>
 dignity in this reply and pardonable pride. Being a citizen of<br>
 Tarsus <b><i>(<!-#-->21:39)</i></b> did not make Paul a Roman citizen. Tarsus was an<br>
 _urbs libera_, not a _colonia_ like Philippi. Some one of his<br>
 ancestors <b><i>(father, grandfather)</i></b> obtained it perhaps as a reward<br>
 for distinguished service. Paul's family was of good social<br>
 position. "He was educated by the greatest of the Rabbis; he was<br>
 at an early age entrusted by the Jewish authorities with an<br>
 important commission; his nephew could gain ready access to the<br>
 Roman tribune; he was treated as a person of consequence by<br>
 Felix, Festus, Agrippa, and Julius" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:29 <B>{Departed from him}</B> <b><i>(\apest&#275;san ap' autou\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active indicative <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b> of \aphist&#275;mi\, stood off from<br>
 him at once. <B>{Was afraid}</B> <b><i>(\ephob&#275;th&#275;\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist<br>
 passive indicative of \phobeomai\, became afraid. He had reason<br>
 to be. <B>{That he was a Roman}</B> <b><i>(\hoti Romaios estin\)</i></b>. Indirect<br>
 assertion with tense of \estin\ retained. <B>{Because he had bound<br>
 him}</B> <b><i>(\hoti auton &#275;n dedek&#333;s\)</i></b>. Causal \hoti\ here after<br>
 declarative \hoti\ just before. Periphrastic past perfect active<br>
 of \de&#333;\, to bind.<br>
 <br>
 22:30 <B>{To know the certainty}</B> <b><i>(\gn&#333;nai to asphales\)</i></b>. Same idiom<br>
 in <!-#-->21:34 which see. <B>{Wherefore he was accused}</B> <b><i>(\to ti<br>
 kategoreitai\)</i></b>. Epexegetical after to \asphales\. Note article<br>
 <b><i>(accusative case)</i></b> with the indirect question here as in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 22:1,23,24 <b><i>(which see)</i></b>, a neat idiom in the Greek. <B>{Commanded}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ekeleusen\)</i></b>. So the Sanhedrin had to meet, but in the Tower of<br>
 Antonia, for he brought Paul down <b><i>(\katagag&#333;n\, second aorist<br>
 active participle of \katag&#333;\)</i></b>. <B>{Set him}</B> <b><i>(\est&#275;sen\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active <b><i>(transitive)</i></b> indicative of \hist&#275;mi\, not the<br>
 intransitive second aorist \est&#275;\. Lysias is determined to find<br>
 out the truth about Paul, more puzzled than ever by the important<br>
 discovery that he has a Roman citizen on his hands in this<br>
 strange prisoner.<br>
