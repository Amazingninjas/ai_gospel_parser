<p>2:1 <B>{Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epeita dia dekatessar&#333;n et&#333;n palin aneb&#275;n\)</i></b> This use of \dia\<br>
 for interval between is common enough. Paul is not giving a<br>
 recital of his visits to Jerusalem, but of his points of contact<br>
 with the apostles in Jerusalem. As already observed, he here<br>
 refers to the Jerusalem Conference given by Luke in <!-#-->Ac 15 when<br>
 Paul and Barnabas were endorsed by the apostles and elders and<br>
 the church over the protest of the Judaizers who had attacked<br>
 them in Antioch <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:1f.)</i></b>. But Paul passes by another visit<br>
 to Jerusalem, that in <!-#-->Ac 11:30 when Barnabas and Saul brought<br>
 alms from Antioch to Jerusalem and delivered them to "the elders"<br>
 with no mention of the apostles who were probably out of the city<br>
 since the events in <!-#-->Ac 12 apparently preceded that visit and<br>
 Peter had left for another place <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 12:17)</i></b>. Paul here gives<br>
 the inside view of this private conference in Jerusalem that came<br>
 in between the two public meetings <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:4,6-29)</i></b>. <B>{With<br>
 Barnabas}</B> <b><i>(\meta Barnab&#257;\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->Ac 15:2. <B>{Taking Titus also<br>
 with me}</B> <b><i>(\sunparalab&#333;n kai Titon\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \sunparalamban&#333;\ the very verb used in <!-#-->Ac 15:37f.<br>
 of the disagreement between Paul and Barnabas about Mark. Titus<br>
 is not mentioned in Acts 15 nor anywhere else in Acts for some<br>
 reason, possibly because he was Luke's own brother. But his very<br>
 presence was a challenge to the Judaizers, since he was a Greek<br>
 Christian.<br>
 <br>
 2:2 <B>{By revelation}</B> <b><i>(\kata apokalupsin\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Ac 15:2 the church<br>
 sent them. But surely there is no inconsistency here. <B>{I laid<br>
 before them}</B> <b><i>(\anethem&#275;n autois\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle<br>
 indicative of old word \anatith&#275;mi\, to put up, to place before,<br>
 with the dative case. But who were the "them" <b><i>(\autois\)</i></b>?<br>
 Evidently not the private conference for he distinguishes this<br>
 address from that, "but privately" <b><i>(\kat' idian\)</i></b>. Just place <!-#-->Ac<br>
 15:4f. beside the first clause and it is clear: "I laid before<br>
 them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles," precisely as<br>
 Luke has recorded. Then came the private conference after the<br>
 uproar caused by the Judaizers <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:5)</i></b>. <B>{Before them who were<br>
 of repute}</B> <b><i>(\tois dokousin\)</i></b>. He names three of them <b><i>(Cephas,<br>
 James, and John)</i></b>. James the Lord's brother, for the other James<br>
 is now dead <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 12:1f.)</i></b>. But there were others also, a select<br>
 group of real leaders. The decision reached by this group would<br>
 shape the decision of the public conference in the adjourned<br>
 meeting. So far as we know Paul had not met John before, though<br>
 he had met Peter and James at the other visit. Lightfoot has much<br>
 to say about the Big Four <b><i>(St. Paul and the Three)</i></b> who here<br>
 discuss the problems of mission work among Jews and Gentiles. It<br>
 was of the utmost importance that they should see eye to eye. The<br>
 Judaizers were assuming that the twelve apostles and James the<br>
 Lord's brother would side with them against Paul and Barnabas.<br>
 Peter had already been before the Jerusalem Church for his work<br>
 in Caesarea <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:1-18)</i></b>. James was considered a very loyal<br>
 Jew. <B>{Lest by any means I should be running or had run in vain}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275; p&#333;s eis kenon trech&#333; &#275; edramon\)</i></b>. Negative purpose with the<br>
 present subjunctive <b><i>(\trech&#333;\)</i></b> and then by a sudden change the<br>
 aorist indicative <b><i>(\edramon\)</i></b>, as a sort of afterthought or<br>
 retrospect <b><i>(Moulton, _Prolegomena_, p. 201; Robertson, _Grammar_,<br>
 p. 988)</i></b>. There are plenty of classical parallels. See also <!-#-->1Th<br>
 3:5 for both together again.<br>
 <br>
 2:3 <B>{Being a Greek}</B> <b><i>(\Hell&#275;n &#333;n\)</i></b>. Concessive participle, though<br>
 he was a Greek. <B>{Was compelled to be circumcised}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;nagkasth&#275;<br>
 peritm&#275;th&#275;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of \anagkaz&#333;\<br>
 and first aorist passive infinitive of \peritemn&#333;\. Curiously<br>
 enough some scholars interpret this language to mean that Paul<br>
 voluntarily had Titus circumcised, instead of being compelled to<br>
 do it, an impossible view in my opinion in the light of verse <!-#-->5<br>
 and wholly inconsistent with the whole context. Paul means that<br>
 he stood his ground against compulsion and all force.<br>
 <br>
 2:4 <B>{But because of the false brethren privately brought in}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dia de tous pareisaktous pseudadelphous\)</i></b>. Late verbal<br>
 adjective \pareisaktos\ from the double compound verb<br>
 \pareisag&#333;\, found in papyri in the sense of brought in by the<br>
 side or on the sly as here. Evidently some of the Judaizers or<br>
 sympathizers whom Paul had not invited had come in as often<br>
 happens. Paul terms them "false brethren" like "the false<br>
 apostles" in <!-#-->2Co 11:13 of the Judaizers in Corinth. <B>{Who came<br>
 in privily}</B> <b><i>(\hoitines pareis&#275;lthon\)</i></b>. Repetition of the charge<br>
 of their slipping in unwanted <b><i>(\pareiserchomai\, late double<br>
 compound, in Plutarch, in N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ro 5:20)</i></b>. <B>{To spy<br>
 out}</B> <b><i>(\kataskop&#275;sai\)</i></b>. First aorist active infinitive of<br>
 \kataskope&#333;\, old Greek verb from \kataskopos\, a spy, to<br>
 reconnoitre, to make a treacherous investigation. <B>{That they<br>
 might bring us into bondage}</B> <b><i>(\hina h&#275;mas katadoul&#333;sousin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Future active indicative of this old compound, to enslave<br>
 completely <b><i>(\kata-\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->2Co 11:20. Nowhere else in N.T. This<br>
 was their purpose <b><i>(\hina\ and future active indicative of this<br>
 causative verb)</i></b>. It was as serious a conflict as this. Spiritual<br>
 liberty or spiritual bondage, which?<br>
 <br>
 2:5 <B>{No, not for an hour}</B> <b><i>(\oude pros h&#333;ran\)</i></b>. Pointed denial<br>
 that he and Barnabas yielded at all "in the way of subjection"<br>
 <b><i>(\t&#275;i hupotag&#275;i\, in the subjection demanded of them)</i></b>. The<br>
 compromisers pleaded for the circumcision of Titus "because of<br>
 the false brethren" in order to have peace. The old verb \eik&#333;\,<br>
 to yield, occurs here alone in the N.T. See <!-#-->2Co 9:13 for<br>
 \hupotag&#275;\. <B>{The truth of the gospel}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; al&#275;theia tou<br>
 euaggeliou\)</i></b>. It was a grave crisis to call for such language.<br>
 The whole problem of Gentile Christianity was involved in the<br>
 case of Titus, whether Christianity was to be merely a modified<br>
 brand of legalistic Judaism or a spiritual religion, the true<br>
 Judaism <b><i>(the children of Abraham by faith)</i></b>. The case of Timothy<br>
 later was utterly different, for he had a Jewish mother and a<br>
 Greek father. Titus was pure Greek.<br>
 <br>
 2:6 <B>{Somewhat}</B> <b><i>(\ti\)</i></b>. Something, not somebody. Paul refers to<br>
 the Big Three <b><i>(Cephas, James, and John)</i></b>. He seems a bit<br>
 embarrassed in the reference. He means no disrespect, but he<br>
 asserts his independence sharply in a tangled sentence with two<br>
 parentheses <b><i>(dashes in Westcott and Hort)</i></b>. <B>{Whatsoever they were}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hopoioi pote &#275;san\)</i></b>. Literally, "What sort they once were."<br>
 <B>{Hopoioi}</B> is a qualitative word <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 1:9; 1Co 3:13; Jas 1:24)</i></b>.<br>
 Lightfoot thinks that these three leaders were the ones who<br>
 suggested the compromise about Titus. That is a possible, but not<br>
 the natural, interpretation of this involved sentence. The use of<br>
 \de\ <b><i>(but)</i></b> in verse <!-#-->6 seems to make a contrast between the<br>
 three leaders and the pleaders for compromise in verses <!-#-->4f.<br>
 <B>{They, I say, imparted nothing to me}</B> <b><i>(\emoi gar ouden<br>
 prosanethento\)</i></b>. He starts over again after the two parentheses<br>
 and drops the construction \apo t&#333;n dokount&#333;n\ and changes the<br>
 construction <b><i>(anacoluthon)</i></b> to \hoi dokountes\ <b><i>(nominative case)</i></b>,<br>
 the men of reputation and influences whom he names in verses<br>
 <!-#-->8f. See the same verb in <!-#-->1:16. They added nothing in the<br>
 conference to me. The compromisers tried to win them, but they<br>
 finally came over to my view. Paul won his point, when he<br>
 persuaded Peter, James, and John to agree with him and Barnabas<br>
 in their contention for freedom for the Gentile Christians from<br>
 the bondage of the Mosaic ceremonial law.<br>
 <br>
 2:7 <B>{But contrariwise}</B> <b><i>(\alla tounantion\)</i></b>. But on the contrary<br>
 <b><i>(accusative of general reference, \to enantion\)</i></b>. So far from the<br>
 three championing the cause of the Judaizers as some hoped or<br>
 even the position of the compromisers in verses <!-#-->4f., they came<br>
 boldly to Paul's side after hearing the case argued in the<br>
 private conference. This is the obvious interpretation rather<br>
 than the view that Peter, James, and John first proposed the<br>
 circumcision of Titus and afterwards surrendered to Paul's bold<br>
 stand. <B>{When they saw}</B> <b><i>(\idontes\)</i></b>. After seeing, after they<br>
 heard our side of the matter. <B>{That I had been intrusted with the<br>
 gospel of the uncircumcision}</B> <b><i>(\hoti pepisteumai to euaggelion<br>
 t&#275;s akrobustias\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative of \pisteu&#333;\, to<br>
 intrust, which retains the accusative of the thing <b><i>(\to<br>
 euaggelion\)</i></b> in the passive voice. This clear-cut agreement<br>
 between the leaders "denotes a distinction of sphere, and not a<br>
 difference of type" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. Both divisions in the work<br>
 preach the same "gospel" <b><i>(not like <!-#-->1:6f., the Judaizers)</i></b>. It<br>
 seems hardly fair to the Three to suggest that they at first<br>
 championed the cause of the Judaizers in the face of Paul's<br>
 strong language in verse <!-#-->5.<br>
 <br>
 2:8 <B>{He that wrought for Peter unto the apostleship of the<br>
 circumcision}</B> <b><i>(\ho gar energ&#275;sas Petr&#333;i eis apostol&#275;n t&#275;s<br>
 peritom&#275;s\)</i></b>. Paul here definitely recognizes Peter's leadership<br>
 <b><i>(apostleship, \apostol&#275;n\, late word, already in <!-#-->Ac 1:25; 1Co<br>
 9:2)</i></b> to the Jews and asserts that Peter acknowledges his<br>
 apostleship to the Gentiles. This is a complete answer to the<br>
 Judaizers who denied the genuineness of Paul's apostleship<br>
 because he was not one of the twelve.<br>
 <br>
 2:9 <B>{They who were reputed to be pillars}</B> <b><i>(\hoi dokountes stuloi<br>
 einai\)</i></b>. They had that reputation <b><i>(\dokountes\)</i></b> and Paul accepts<br>
 them as such. \Stuloi\, old word for pillars, columns, as of fire<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 10:1)</i></b>. So of the church <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 3:15)</i></b>. These were the Pillar<br>
 Apostles. <B>{Gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dexias ed&#333;kan emoi kai Barnab&#257;i koin&#333;nias\)</i></b>. Dramatic and<br>
 concluding act of the pact for cooperation and coordinate,<br>
 independent spheres of activity. The compromisers and the<br>
 Judaizers were brushed to one side when these five men shook<br>
 hands as equals in the work of Christ's Kingdom.<br>
 <br>
 2:10 <B>{Only}</B> <b><i>(\monon\)</i></b>. One item was emphasized. <B>{We should<br>
 remember}</B> <b><i>(\mn&#275;moneu&#333;men\)</i></b>. Present active subjunctive, "that we<br>
 should keep on remembering." <B>{Which very thing}</B> <b><i>(\ho--auto<br>
 touto\)</i></b>. Repetition of relative and demonstrative, tautology,<br>
 "which this very thing." In fact Barnabas and Saul had done it<br>
 before <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:30)</i></b>. It was complete victory for Paul and<br>
 Barnabas. Paul passes by the second public meeting and the<br>
 letters to Antioch <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:6-29)</i></b> and passes on to Peter's<br>
 conduct in Antioch.<br>
 <br>
 2:11 <B>{I resisted him to the face}</B> <b><i>(\kata pros&#333;pon aut&#333;i<br>
 antest&#275;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b> of<br>
 \anthist&#275;mi\. "I stood against him face to face." In Jerusalem<br>
 Paul faced Peter as his equal in rank and sphere of work. In<br>
 Antioch he looked him in the eye as his superior in character and<br>
 courage. <B>{Because he stood condemned}</B> <b><i>(\hoti kategn&#333;smenos &#275;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic past perfect passive of \kataginosk&#333;\, old verb to<br>
 know against, to find fault with. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->1Jo<br>
 3:20f.<br>
 <br>
 2:12 <B>{For before that certain came from James}</B> <b><i>(\pro tou gar<br>
 elthein tinas apo Iak&#333;bou\)</i></b>. The reason <b><i>(\gar\)</i></b> for Paul's<br>
 condemnation of Peter. Articular infinitive in the genitive after<br>
 \pro\ with the accusative of general reference <b><i>(\tinas\)</i></b>, "for<br>
 before the coming as to some from James." Does Paul mean to say<br>
 that these "certain" ones had been sent by James to Antioch to<br>
 inspect the conduct of Peter and the other Jewish brethren? Some<br>
 scholars think so. No doubt these brethren let the idea get out<br>
 that they were emissaries "from James." But that idea is<br>
 inconsistent with the position of James as president of the<br>
 conference and the author of the resolution securing liberty to<br>
 the Gentile Christians. No doubt these brethren threatened Peter<br>
 to tell James and the church about his conduct and they reminded<br>
 Peter of his previous arraignment before the Jerusalem Church on<br>
 this very charge <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:1-18)</i></b>. As a matter of fact the<br>
 Jerusalem Conference did not discuss the matter of social<br>
 relations between Jews and Gentiles though that was the charge<br>
 made against Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:1ff.)</i></b>. <B>{He did eat with the Gentiles}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\meta t&#333;n ethn&#333;n sun&#275;sthien\)</i></b>. It was his habit <b><i>(imperfect<br>
 tense)</i></b>. <B>{He drew back}</B> <b><i>(\hupestellen\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense,<br>
 inchoative action, "he began to draw himself <b><i>(\heauton\)</i></b> back."<br>
 Old word \hupostell&#333;\. See middle voice to dissemble <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 20:20,27)</i></b>, to shrink <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 10:38)</i></b>. <B>{Separated himself}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aph&#333;rizen heauton\)</i></b>. Inchoative imperfect again, "began to<br>
 separate himself" just like a Pharisee <b><i>(see on &#175;1:15)</i></b> and as if<br>
 afraid of the Judaizers in the Jerusalem Church, perhaps half<br>
 afraid that James might not endorse what he had been doing.<br>
 <B>{Fearing them that were of the circumcision}</B> <b><i>(\phoboumenos tous<br>
 ek peritom&#275;s\)</i></b>. This was the real reason for Peter's cowardice.<br>
 See <!-#-->Ac 11:2 for "\hoi ek peritom&#275;s\" <b><i>(they of the<br>
 circumcision)</i></b>, the very phrase here. It was not that Peter had<br>
 changed his views from the Jerusalem resolutions. It was pure<br>
 fear of trouble to himself as in the denials at the trial of<br>
 Christ.<br>
 <br>
 2:13 <B>{Dissembled likewise with him}</B> <b><i>(\sunupekrith&#275;san aut&#333;i<br>
 kai\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of the double compound<br>
 verb \sunupokrinomai\, a late word often in Polybius, only here<br>
 in N.T. One example in Polybius means to pretend to act a part<br>
 with. That idea here would help the case of the rest of the Jews,<br>
 but does not accord with Paul's presentation. <B>{Insomuch that even<br>
 Barnabas}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste kai Barnabas\)</i></b>. Actual result expressed by<br>
 \h&#333;ste\ and the indicative and \kai\ clearly means "even." <B>{Was<br>
 carried away with their dissimulation}</B> <b><i>(\sunap&#275;chth&#275; aut&#333;n t&#275;i<br>
 hupokrisei\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of \sunapag&#333;\, old<br>
 verb, in N.T. only here and <!-#-->2Pe 3:17. \Hupokrisei\ is in the<br>
 instrumental case and can only mean hypocrisy in the bad sense<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 23:28)</i></b>, not merely acting a part. It was a solemn moment<br>
 when Paul saw the Jerusalem victory vanish and even Barnabas<br>
 desert him as they followed the timid cowardice of Peter. It was<br>
 _Paulus contra mundum_ in the cause of spiritual freedom in<br>
 Christ.<br>
 <br>
 2:14 <B>{But when I saw}</B> <b><i>(\All' hote eidon\)</i></b>. Paul did see and saw<br>
 it in time to speak. <B>{That they walked not uprightly}</B> <b><i>(\hoti<br>
 orthopodousin\)</i></b>. Present active indicative retained in indirect<br>
 discourse, "they are not walking straight." \Orthopode&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(\orthos\, straight, \pous\, foot)</i></b>. Found only here and in later<br>
 ecclesiastical writers, though \orthopodes bainontes\ does occur.<br>
 <B>{According to the truth of the gospel}</B> <b><i>(\pros t&#275;n al&#275;theian tou<br>
 euaggeliou\)</i></b>. Just as in <!-#-->2:5. Paul brought them to face<br>
 <b><i>(\pros\)</i></b> that. <B>{I said unto Cephas before them all}</B> <b><i>(\eipon t&#333;i<br>
 K&#275;ph&#257;i emprosthen pant&#333;n\)</i></b>. <B>{Being a Jew}</B> <b><i>(\Ioudaios huparch&#333;n\,<br>
 though being a Jew)</i></b>. Condition of first class, assumed as true.<br>
 It was not a private quarrel, but a matter of public policy. One<br>
 is a bit curious to know what those who consider Peter the first<br>
 pope will do with this open rebuke by Paul, who was in no sense<br>
 afraid of Peter or of all the rest. <B>{As do the Gentiles}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ethnik&#333;s\)</i></b>. Late adverb, here only in N.T. Like Gentiles. <B>{As<br>
 do the Jews}</B> <b><i>(\Ioudaik&#333;s\)</i></b>. Only here in N.T., but in Josephus.<br>
 <B>{To live as do the Jews}</B> <b><i>(\Iouda&#8249;zein\)</i></b>. Late verb, only here in<br>
 the N.T. From \Ioudaios\, Jew. Really Paul charges Peter with<br>
 trying to compel <b><i>(conative present, \anagkazeis\)</i></b> the Gentiles to<br>
 live all like Jews, to Judaize the Gentile Christians, the very<br>
 point at issue in the Jerusalem Conference when Peter so loyally<br>
 supported Paul. It was a bold thrust that allowed no reply. But<br>
 Paul won Peter back and Barnabas also. If II Peter is genuine, as<br>
 is still possible, he shows it in <!-#-->2Pe 3:15. Paul and Barnabas<br>
 remained friends <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:39f.; 1Co 9:6)</i></b>, though they soon<br>
 separated over John Mark.<br>
 <br>
 2:15 <B>{Not sinners of the Gentiles}</B> <b><i>(\ouk ex ethn&#333;n hamart&#333;loi\)</i></b>.<br>
 The Jews regarded all Gentiles as "sinners" in contrast with<br>
 themselves <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mt 26:45 "sinners" and <!-#-->Lu 18:32 "Gentiles")</i></b>.<br>
 It is not clear whether verses <!-#-->15-21 were spoken by Paul to<br>
 Peter or whether Paul is now simply addressing the Galatians in<br>
 the light of the controversy with Peter. Burton thinks that he is<br>
 "mentally addressing Peter, if not quoting from what he said to<br>
 him."<br>
 <br>
 2:16 <B>{Is not justified}</B> <b><i>(\ou dikaioutai\)</i></b>. Present passive<br>
 indicative of \dikaio&#333;\, an old causative verb from \dikaios\,<br>
 righteous <b><i>(from \dike\, right)</i></b>, to make righteous, to declare<br>
 righteous. It is made like \axio&#333;\, to deem worthy, and \koino&#333;\,<br>
 to consider common. It is one of the great Pauline words along<br>
 with \dikaiosun&#275;\, righteousness. The two ways of getting right<br>
 with God are here set forth: by faith in Christ Jesus <b><i>(objective<br>
 genitive)</i></b>, by the works of the law <b><i>(by keeping all the law in the<br>
 most minute fashion, the way of the Pharisees)</i></b>. Paul knew them<br>
 both <b><i>(see <!-#-->Ro 7)</i></b>. In his first recorded sermon the same contrast<br>
 is made that we have here <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 13:39)</i></b> with the same word<br>
 \dikaio&#333;\, employed. It is the heart of his message in all his<br>
 Epistles. The terms faith <b><i>(\pistis\)</i></b>, righteousness<br>
 <b><i>(\dikaiosun&#275;\)</i></b>, law <b><i>(\nomos\)</i></b>, works <b><i>(\erga\)</i></b> occur more<br>
 frequently in Galatians and Romans because Paul is dealing<br>
 directly with the problem in opposition to the Judaizers who<br>
 contended that Gentiles had to become Jews to be saved. The whole<br>
 issue is here in an acute form. <B>{Save}</B> <b><i>(\ean m&#275;\)</i></b>. Except. <B>{Even<br>
 we}</B> <b><i>(\kai h&#275;meis\)</i></b>. We Jews believed, had to believe, were not<br>
 saved or justified till we did believe. This very point Peter had<br>
 made at the Jerusalem Conference <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:10f.)</i></b>. He quotes <!-#-->Ps<br>
 143:2. Paul uses \dikaiosun&#275;\ in two senses <b><i>(1)</i></b> Justification,<br>
 on the basis of what Christ has done and obtained by faith. Thus<br>
 we are set right with God. <!-#-->Ro 1-5. <b><i>(2)</i></b> Sanctification. Actual<br>
 goodness as the result of living with and for Christ. <!-#-->Ro 6-8.<br>
 The same plan exists for Jew and Gentile.<br>
 <br>
 2:17 <B>{We ourselves were found sinners}</B> <b><i>(\heureth&#275;men kai autoi<br>
 hamart&#333;loi\)</i></b>. Like the Gentiles, Jews who thought they were not<br>
 sinners, when brought close to Christ, found that they were. Paul<br>
 felt like the chief of sinners. <B>{A minister of sin}</B> <b><i>(\hamartias<br>
 diakonos\)</i></b>. Objective genitive, a minister to sin. An illogical<br>
 inference. We were sinners already in spite of being Jews. Christ<br>
 simply revealed to us our sin. <B>{God forbid}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; genoito\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "May it not happen." Wish about the future <b><i>(\m&#275;\ and<br>
 the optative)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:18 <B>{A transgressor}</B> <b><i>(\parabat&#275;n\)</i></b>. Peter, by his shifts had<br>
 contradicted himself helplessly as Paul shows by this condition.<br>
 When he lived like a Gentile, he tore down the ceremonial law.<br>
 When he lived like a Jew, he tore down salvation by grace.<br>
 <br>
 2:19 <B>{I through the law died to the law}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; dia nomou nom&#333;i<br>
 apethanon\)</i></b>. Paradoxical, but true. See <!-#-->Rom 7:4,6 for picture<br>
 of how the law waked Paul up to his real death to the law through<br>
 Christ.<br>
 <br>
 2:20 <B>{I have been crucified with Christ}</B> <b><i>(\Christ&#333;i<br>
 sunestaur&#333;mai\)</i></b>. One of Paul's greatest mystical sayings. Perfect<br>
 passive indicative of \sustauro&#333;\ with the associative<br>
 instrumental case <b><i>(\Christ&#333;i\)</i></b>. Paul uses the same word in <!-#-->Ro<br>
 6:6 for the same idea. In the Gospels it occurs of literal<br>
 crucifixion about the robbers and Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:44; Mr 15:32;<br>
 Joh 19:32)</i></b>. Paul died to the law and was crucified with Christ.<br>
 He uses often the idea of dying with Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 5:24; 6:14; Ro<br>
 6:8; Col 2:20)</i></b> and burial with Christ also <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 6:4; Col 2:12)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{No longer I}</B> <b><i>(\ouketi eg&#333;\)</i></b>. So complete has become Paul's<br>
 identification with Christ that his separate personality is<br>
 merged into that of Christ. This language helps one to understand<br>
 the victorious cry in <!-#-->Ro 7:25. It is the union of the vine and<br>
 the branch <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 15:1-6)</i></b>. <B>{Which is in the Son of God}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i tou<br>
 huiou tou theou\)</i></b>. The objective genitive, not the faith of the<br>
 Son of God. <B>{For me}</B> <b><i>(\huper emou\)</i></b>. Paul has the closest<br>
 personal feeling toward Christ. "He appropriates to himself, as<br>
 Chrysostom observes, the love which belongs equally to the whole<br>
 world. For Christ is indeed the personal friend of each man<br>
 individually" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:21 <B>{I do not make void the grace of God}</B> <b><i>(\ouk athet&#333; t&#275;n<br>
 charin tou theou\)</i></b>. Common word in LXX and Polybius and on, to<br>
 make ineffective <b><i>(\a\ privative and \tith&#275;mi\, to place or put)</i></b>.<br>
 Some critic would charge him with that after his claim to such a<br>
 close mystic union with Christ. <B>{Then Christ died for nought}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ara Christos d&#333;rean apethanen\)</i></b>. Condition of first class,<br>
 assumed as true. If one man apart from grace can win his own<br>
 righteousness, any man can and should. Hence <b><i>(\ara\, accordingly)</i></b><br>
 Christ died gratuitously <b><i>(\d&#333;rean\)</i></b>, unnecessarily. Adverbial<br>
 accusative of \d&#333;rea\, a gift. This verse is a complete answer to<br>
 those who say that the heathen <b><i>(or any mere moralist)</i></b> are saved<br>
 by doing the best that they know and can. No one, apart from<br>
 Jesus, ever did the best that he knew or could. To be saved by<br>
 law <b><i>(\dia nomou\)</i></b> one has to keep all the law that he knows. That<br>
 no one ever did.<br>
