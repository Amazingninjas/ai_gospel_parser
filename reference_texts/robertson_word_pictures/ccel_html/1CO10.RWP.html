<p>10:1 <B>{For}</B> <b><i>(\gar\)</i></b>. Correct text, not \de\. Paul appeals to the<br>
 experience of the Israelites in the wilderness in confirmation of<br>
 his statement concerning himself in <!-#-->9:26f. and as a powerful<br>
 warning to the Corinthians who may be tempted to flirt with the<br>
 idolatrous practices of their neighbours. It is a real, not an<br>
 imaginary peril. <B>{All under the cloud}</B> <b><i>(\pantes hupo t&#275;n<br>
 nephel&#275;n\)</i></b>. They all marched under the pillar of cloud by day<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 13:21; 14:19)</i></b> which covered the host <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 14:14; Ps<br>
 95:39)</i></b>. This mystic cloud was the symbol of the presence of the<br>
 Lord with the people.<br>
 <br>
 10:2 <B>{Were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pantes eis ton M&#333;us&#275;n ebaptisanto en t&#275;i nephel&#275;i kai en t&#275;i<br>
 thalass&#275;i\)</i></b>. The picture is plain enough. The mystic cloud<br>
 covered the people while the sea rose in walls on each side of<br>
 them as they marched across. B K L P read \ebaptisanto\<br>
 <b><i>(causative first aorist middle, got themselves baptized)</i></b> while<br>
 Aleph A C D have \ebaptisth&#275;san\ <b><i>(first aorist passive, were<br>
 baptized)</i></b>. The immersion was complete for all of them in the sea<br>
 around them and the cloud over them. Moses was their leader then<br>
 as Christ is now and so Paul uses \eis\ concerning the relation<br>
 of the Israelites to Moses as he does of our baptism in relation<br>
 to Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 3:27)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:3 <B>{The same spiritual meat}</B> <b><i>(\to auto pneumatikon br&#333;ma\)</i></b>.<br>
 Westcott and Hort needlessly bracket to \auto\. \Br&#333;ma\ is food,<br>
 not just flesh. The reference is to the manna <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 16:13ff.)</i></b><br>
 which is termed "spiritual" by reason of its supernatural<br>
 character. Jesus called himself the true bread from heaven <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 6:35)</i></b> which the manna typified.<br>
 <br>
 10:4 <B>{For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epinon ek pneumatik&#275;s akolouthous&#275;s petras\)</i></b>. Change to the<br>
 imperfect \epinon\ shows their continual access to the<br>
 supernatural source of supply. The Israelites were blessed by the<br>
 water from the rock that Moses smote at Rephidim <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 17:6)</i></b> and<br>
 at Kadesh <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 20:11)</i></b> and by the well of Beer <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 21:16)</i></b>. The<br>
 rabbis had a legend that the water actually followed the<br>
 Israelites for forty years, in one form a fragment of rock<br>
 fifteen feet high that followed the people and gushed out water.<br>
 Baur and some other scholars think that Paul adopts this<br>
 "Rabbinical legend that the water-bearing Rephidim rock journeyed<br>
 onwards with the Israelites" <b><i>(Findlay)</i></b>. That is hard to believe,<br>
 though it is quite possible that Paul alludes to this fancy and<br>
 gives it a spiritual turn as a type of Christ in allegorical<br>
 fashion. Paul knew the views of the rabbis and made use of<br>
 allegory on occasion <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 4:24)</i></b>. <B>{And the rock was Christ}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;<br>
 petra de &#275;n ho Christos\)</i></b>. He definitely states here in symbolic<br>
 form the preexistence of Christ. But surely "we must not disgrace<br>
 Paul by making him say that the pre-incarnate Christ followed the<br>
 march of Israel in the shape of a lump of rock" <b><i>(Hofmann)</i></b>. He<br>
 does mean that Christ was the source of the water which saved the<br>
 Israelites from perishing <b><i>(Robertson and Plummer)</i></b> as he is the<br>
 source of supply for us today.<br>
 <br>
 10:5 <B>{With most of them}</B> <b><i>(\en tois pleiosin aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. "A mournful<br>
 understatement," for only two <b><i>(Caleb and Joshua)</i></b> actually reached<br>
 the Promised Land <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 14:30-32)</i></b>. All the rest were rejected or<br>
 \adokimoi\ <b><i>(<!-#-->9:27)</i></b>. <B>{Were overthrown}</B> <b><i>(\katestr&#333;th&#275;san\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive indicative of \katastr&#333;nnumi\, old compound verb,<br>
 to stretch or spread down as of a couch, to lay low <b><i>(Euripides)</i></b>,<br>
 as if by a hurricane. Powerful picture of the desolation wrought<br>
 by the years of disobedience and wanderings in the desert by this<br>
 verb quoted from <!-#-->Nu 14:16.<br>
 <br>
 10:6 <B>{Were our examples}</B> <b><i>(\tupoi h&#275;m&#333;n egen&#275;th&#275;san\)</i></b>. More<br>
 exactly, examples for us <b><i>(objective genitive \h&#275;m&#333;n\, not<br>
 subjective genitive, of us)</i></b>. The word \tupoi\ <b><i>(our types)</i></b> comes<br>
 from \tupt&#333;\, to strike, and meant originally the mark of a blow<br>
 as the print of the nails <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 20:25)</i></b>, then a figure formed by<br>
 a blow like images of the gods <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 7:43)</i></b>, then an example to be<br>
 imitated <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 5:3; 1Ti 4:12; 1Th 1:7; 2Th 3:9)</i></b>, or to be<br>
 avoided as here, and finally a type in a doctrinal sense <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro<br>
 5:14; Heb 9:24)</i></b>. <B>{To the intent we should not lust after}</B> <b><i>(\eis<br>
 to m&#275; einai h&#275;mas epithum&#275;tas\)</i></b>. Purpose expressed by \eis\ with<br>
 the articular infinitive \to einai\ and the accusative of general<br>
 reference with \epithum&#275;tas\ <b><i>(lusters)</i></b> in the predicate.<br>
 <br>
 10:7 <B>{Neither be ye idolaters}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;de eid&#333;lolatrai ginesthe\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, stop becoming idolaters, implying that some of them<br>
 had already begun to be. The word \eid&#333;lolatr&#275;s\ seems to be a<br>
 Christian formation to describe the Christian view. Eating \ta<br>
 eid&#333;lothuta\ might become a stepping-stone to idolatry in some<br>
 instances. <B>{Drink}</B> <b><i>(\pein\)</i></b>. Short form for \piein\, sometimes<br>
 even \pin\ occurs <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 204)</i></b>. <B>{To play}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\paizein\)</i></b>. This old verb to play like a child occurs nowhere<br>
 else in the N.T., but is common in the LXX and it is quoted here<br>
 from <!-#-->Ex 32:6. In idolatrous festivals like that witnessed by<br>
 Moses when he saw the people singing and dancing around the<br>
 golden calf <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 32:18f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:8 <B>{Neither let us commit fornication}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;de porneu&#333;men\)</i></b>.<br>
 More exactly, And let us cease practicing fornication as some<br>
 were already doing <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 6:11; 7:2)</i></b>. The connection between<br>
 idolatry and fornication was very close <b><i>(see Jowett, _Epistles of<br>
 Paul_, II, p. 70)</i></b> and see about Baal-Peor <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 25:1-9)</i></b>. It was<br>
 terribly true of Corinth where prostitution was part of the<br>
 worship of Aphrodite. <B>{In one day}</B> <b><i>(\mi&#257;i h&#275;mer&#257;i\)</i></b>. An item that<br>
 adds to horror of the plague in <!-#-->Nu 25:9 where the total number<br>
 is 24,000 instead of 23,000 as here for one day.<br>
 <br>
 10:9 <B>{Neither let us tempt the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;de ekpeiraz&#333;men ton<br>
 Kurion\)</i></b>. So the best MSS. instead of Christ. This compound<br>
 occurs in LXX and in N.T. always about Christ <b><i>(here and <!-#-->Mt 4:7;<br>
 Lu 4:12; 10:25)</i></b>. Let us cease sorely <b><i>(\ek-\)</i></b> tempting the Lord<br>
 by such conduct. <B>{And perished by the serpents}</B> <b><i>(\kai hupo t&#333;n<br>
 ophe&#333;n ap&#333;llunto\)</i></b>. Vivid imperfect middle <b><i>(cf. aorist middle<br>
 \ap&#333;lonto\ in verse <!-#-->10)</i></b>, were perishing day by day. The story<br>
 is told in <!-#-->Nu 21:6. The use of \hupo\ for agent with the<br>
 intransitive middle of \apollumi\ is regular. Note the Ionic<br>
 uncontracted genitive plural \ophe&#333;n\ rather than \oph&#333;n\.<br>
 <br>
 10:10 <B>{Neither murmur ye}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;de gogguzete\)</i></b>. Implying that some<br>
 of them were murmuring. For this late picturesque onomatopoetic<br>
 verb see on &#175;Mt 20:11. The reference seems to be to <!-#-->Nu 16:41f.<br>
 after the punishment of Korah. <B>{By the destroyer}</B> <b><i>(\hupo tou<br>
 olothreutou\)</i></b>. This word, from \olothreu&#333;\ <b><i>(late verb from<br>
 \olethros\, destruction)</i></b> occurs only here, so far as known. The<br>
 reference is to the destroying angel of <!-#-->Ex 12:23 <b><i>(\ho<br>
 olothreu&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:11 <B>{Now these things happened unto them}</B> <b><i>(\tauta de sunebainon<br>
 ekeinois\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense because they happened from time to<br>
 time. <B>{By way of example}</B> <b><i>(\tupik&#333;s\)</i></b>. Adverb in sense of \tupoi\<br>
 in verse <!-#-->6. Only instance of the adverb except in<br>
 ecclesiastical writers after this time, but adjective \tupikos\<br>
 occurs in a late papyrus. <B>{For our admonition}</B> <b><i>(\pros nouthesian<br>
 h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. Objective genitive <b><i>(\h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b> again. \Nouthesia\ is late<br>
 word from \nouthete&#333;\ <b><i>(see on &#175;Ac 20:31; 1Th 5:12,14)</i></b> for<br>
 earlier \nouthet&#275;sis\ and \nouthetia\. <B>{The ends of the ages have<br>
 come}</B> <b><i>(\ta tel&#275; t&#333;n ai&#333;n&#333;n kat&#275;nt&#275;ken\)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Heb 9:26 \h&#275;<br>
 sunteleia t&#333;n ai&#333;n&#333;n\, the consummation of the ages <b><i>(also <!-#-->Mt<br>
 13:40)</i></b>. The plural seems to point out how one stage succeeds<br>
 another in the drama of human history. \Kat&#275;nt&#275;ken\ is perfect<br>
 active indicative of \katanta&#333;\, late verb, to come down to <b><i>(see<br>
 on &#175;Ac 16:1)</i></b>. Does Paul refer to the second coming of Christ as<br>
 in <!-#-->7:26? In a sense the ends of the ages like a curtain have<br>
 come down to all of us.<br>
 <br>
 10:12 <B>{Lest he fall}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; pes&#275;i\)</i></b>. Negative purpose with \m&#275;\ and<br>
 second aorist active subjunctive of \pipt&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 10:13 <B>{Hath taken}</B> <b><i>(\eil&#275;phen\)</i></b>. Perfect active indicative of<br>
 \lamban&#333;\. <B>{But such as man can bear}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275; anthr&#333;pinos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Except a human one. Old adjective meaning falling to the lot of<br>
 man. <B>{Above that ye are able}</B> <b><i>(\huper ho dunasthe\)</i></b>. Ellipsis,<br>
 but plain. There is comfort in that God is faithful, trustworthy<br>
 <b><i>(\pistos\)</i></b>. <B>{The way of escape}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n ekbasin\)</i></b>. "The way out" is<br>
 always there right along with <b><i>(\sun\)</i></b> the temptation. This old<br>
 word only here in N.T. and <!-#-->Heb 13:7 about death. It is cowardly<br>
 to yield to temptation and distrustful of God.<br>
 <br>
 10:14 <B>{Wherefore}</B> <b><i>(\dioper\)</i></b>. Powerfully Paul applies the example<br>
 of the Israelites to the perilous state of the Corinthians about<br>
 idolatry. See on verse &#175;7 for word \eid&#333;lolatreia\.<br>
 <br>
 10:15 <B>{As to wise men}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s phronimois\)</i></b>. No sarcasm as in <!-#-->2Co<br>
 11:19, but plea that they make proper use of the mind <b><i>(\phren\)</i></b><br>
 given them.<br>
 <br>
 10:16 <B>{The cup of blessing}</B> <b><i>(\to pot&#275;rion t&#275;s eulogias\)</i></b>. The cup<br>
 over which we pronounce a blessing as by Christ at the<br>
 institution of the ordinance. <B>{A communion of the blood of<br>
 Christ}</B> <b><i>(\koin&#333;nia tou haimatos tou Christou\)</i></b>. Literally, a<br>
 participation in <b><i>(objective genitive)</i></b> the blood of Christ. The<br>
 word \koin&#333;nia\ is an old one from \koin&#333;nos\, partner, and so<br>
 here and <!-#-->Php 2:1; 3:10. It can mean also fellowship <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 2:9)</i></b><br>
 or contribution <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 8:4; Php 1:5)</i></b>. It is, of course, a<br>
 spiritual participation in the blood of Christ which is<br>
 symbolized by the cup. Same meaning for \koin&#333;nia\ in reference<br>
 to "the body of Christ." <B>{The bread which we break}</B> <b><i>(\ton arton<br>
 hon kl&#333;men\)</i></b>. The loaf. Inverse attraction of the antecedent<br>
 <b><i>(\arton\)</i></b> to the case <b><i>(accusative)</i></b> of the relative <b><i>(\hon\)</i></b><br>
 according to classic idiom <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 488)</i></b>.<br>
 \Artos\ probably from \ar&#333;\, to join or fit <b><i>(flour mixed with<br>
 water and baked)</i></b>. The mention of the cup here before the bread<br>
 does not mean that this order was observed for see the regular<br>
 order of bread and then cup in <!-#-->11:24-27.<br>
 <br>
 10:17 <B>{One bread}</B> <b><i>(\heis artos\)</i></b>. One loaf. <B>{Who are many}</B> <b><i>(\hoi<br>
 polloi\)</i></b>. The many. <B>{We all}</B> <b><i>(\hoi pantes\)</i></b>. We the all, the<br>
 whole number, \hoi pantes\ being in apposition with the subject<br>
 <B>{we}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meis\ unexpressed)</i></b>. <B>{Partake}</B> <b><i>(\metechomen\)</i></b>. Have a<br>
 part with or in, share in. See on &#175;9:12; Heb 2:14; 5:13<br>
 <b><i>(partaking of milk)</i></b>. <B>{Of the one bread}</B> <b><i>(\tou henos artou\)</i></b>. Of<br>
 the one loaf, the article \tou\ referring to one loaf already<br>
 mentioned. <B>{One body}</B> <b><i>(\hen s&#333;ma\)</i></b>. Here the mystical spiritual<br>
 body of Christ as in <!-#-->12:12f., the spiritual kingdom or church<br>
 of which Christ is head <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 1:18; Eph 5:23)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:18 <B>{After the flesh}</B> <b><i>(\kata sarka\)</i></b>. The literal Israel, the<br>
 Jewish people, not the spiritual Israel <b><i>(\Isra&#275;l kata pneuma\)</i></b><br>
 composed of both Jews and Gentiles, the true children of faith<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 2:28; 9:8; Gal 3:7)</i></b>. <B>{Communion with the altar}</B> <b><i>(\koin&#333;noi<br>
 tou thusiast&#275;riou\)</i></b>. Same idea in \koin&#333;noi\ participators in,<br>
 partners in, sharers in <b><i>(with objective genitive)</i></b>. The word<br>
 \thusiast&#275;rion\ is from late verb \thusiaz&#333;\, to offer sacrifice,<br>
 and that from \thusia\, sacrifice, and that from \thu&#333;\, common<br>
 verb to slay, to sacrifice <b><i>(verse <!-#-->20)</i></b>. The Israelites who offer<br>
 sacrifices have a spiritual participation in the altar.<br>
 <br>
 10:19 <B>{A thing sacrificed to idols}</B> <b><i>(\eid&#333;lothuton\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Ac<br>
 15:29; 1Co 8:1,4. <B>{Idol}</B> <b><i>(\eid&#333;lon\)</i></b>. Image of a god. See on &#175;Ac<br>
 7:41; 15:20; 1Co 8:4,7.<br>
 <br>
 10:20 <B>{But I say that}</B> <b><i>(\all' hoti\)</i></b>. The verb \ph&#275;mi\ <b><i>(I say)</i></b><br>
 must be repeated from verse <!-#-->19 before \hoti\. <B>{To demons, and<br>
 not to God}</B> <b><i>(\daimoniois kai ou the&#333;i\)</i></b>. Referring to LXX text of<br>
 <!-#-->De 32:17. It is probable that by \ou the&#333;i\ Paul means "to a<br>
 no-god" as also in <!-#-->De 32:21 \ep' ouk ethnei\ <b><i>(by a no-people)</i></b>.<br>
 This is Paul's reply to the heathen who claimed that they<br>
 worshipped the gods represented by the images and not the mere<br>
 wood or stone or metal idols. The word \daimonia\ is an adjective<br>
 \daimonios\ from \daim&#333;n\, an inferior deity, and with same idea<br>
 originally, once in this sense in N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 17:18)</i></b>. Elsewhere in<br>
 N.T. it has the notion of evil spirits as here, those spiritual<br>
 forces of wickedness <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph 6:12)</i></b> that are under the control of<br>
 Satan. The word \daimonia\, so common in the Gospels, occurs in<br>
 Paul's writings only here and <!-#-->1Ti 4:1. Demonology is a deep and<br>
 dark subject here pictured by Paul as the explanation of<br>
 heathenism which is a departure from God <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:19-23)</i></b> and a<br>
 substitute for the worship of God. It is a terrible indictment<br>
 which is justified by the licentious worship associated with<br>
 paganism then and now.<br>
 <br>
 10:21 <B>{Ye cannot}</B> <b><i>(\ou dunasthe\)</i></b>. Morally impossible to drink<br>
 the Lord's cup and the cup of demons, to partake of the Lord's<br>
 table and the table of demons. <B>{Of the table of the Lord}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\trapez&#275;s Kuriou\)</i></b>. No articles, but definite idea. \Trapeza\ is<br>
 from \tetra\ <b><i>(four)</i></b> and \peza\ <b><i>(a foot)</i></b>, four-footed. Here<br>
 <B>{table}</B> means, as often, what is on the table. See <!-#-->Lu 22:30<br>
 where Jesus says "at my table" <b><i>(\epi t&#275;s trapez&#275;s mou\)</i></b>,<br>
 referring to the spiritual feast hereafter. Here the reference is<br>
 plainly to the Lord's Supper <b><i>(\Kuriakon deipnon\, <!-#-->1Co 11:20)</i></b>.<br>
 See allusions in O.T. to use of the table in heathen idol feasts<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 65:11; Jer 7:18; Eze 16:18f.; 23:41)</i></b>. The altar of<br>
 burnt-offering is called the table of the Lord in <!-#-->Mal 1:7<br>
 <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:22 <B>{Provoke to jealousy}</B> <b><i>(\paraz&#275;loumen\)</i></b>. The very word used<br>
 in <!-#-->De 32:21 of the insolence of the old Israelites. Quoted in<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 10:19. Such double-dealing now will do this very thing.<br>
 <B>{Stronger than he}</B> <b><i>(\ischuroteroi autou\)</i></b>. Comparative adjective<br>
 followed by the ablative.<br>
 <br>
 10:23 See on &#175;6:12 for <B>{lawful}</B> <b><i>(\exestin\)</i></b> and <B>{expedient}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sumpherei\)</i></b>. <B>{Edify not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk oikodomei\)</i></b>. Build up.<br>
 Explanation of <B>{expedient}</B> <b><i>(\sumpherei\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:24 <B>{Let no man seek his own}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;deis to heautou z&#275;teit&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 This is Paul's rule for social relations <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 13:5; Ga 6:2; Ro<br>
 14:7; 15:2; Php 2:1ff.)</i></b> and is the way to do what is expedient<br>
 and what builds up. <B>{His neighbour's good}</B> <b><i>(\to tou heterou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "the affair of the other man." Cf. \ton heteron\ in<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 13:8 for this idea of \heteros\ like \ho pl&#275;sion\ <b><i>(the nigh<br>
 man, the neighbour)</i></b> in <!-#-->Ro 15:2. This is loving your neighbour<br>
 as yourself by preferring your neighbour's welfare to your own<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 2:4)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:25 <B>{In the shambles}</B> <b><i>(\en makell&#333;i\)</i></b>. Only here in N.T. A<br>
 transliterated Latin word _macellum_, possibly akin to \maceria\<br>
 and the Hebrew word for enclosure, though occurring in Ionic and<br>
 Laconian and more frequent in the Latin. It occurs in Dio Cassius<br>
 and Plutarch and in the papyri and inscriptions for "the<br>
 provision market." Deissmann <b><i>(_Light from the Ancient East_, p.<br>
 276)</i></b> says: "In the Macellum at Pompeii we can imagine to<br>
 ourselves the poor Christians buying their modest pound of meat<br>
 in the Corinthian Macellum <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 10:25)</i></b>, with the same life-like<br>
 reality with which the Diocletian maximum tariff called up the<br>
 picture of the Galilean woman purchasing her five sparrows."<br>
 <B>{Asking no questions for conscience sake}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;den anakrinontes<br>
 dia t&#275;n suneid&#275;sin\)</i></b>. As to whether a particular piece of meat<br>
 had been offered to idols before put in the market. Only a part<br>
 was consumed in the sacrifices to heathen gods. The rest was sold<br>
 in the market. Do not be over-scrupulous. Paul here champions<br>
 liberty in the matter as he had done in <!-#-->8:4.<br>
 <br>
 10:26 This verse gives the reason for Paul's advice. It is a<br>
 quotation from <!-#-->Ps 24:1 and was a common form of grace before<br>
 meals. <B>{Fulness}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;r&#333;ma\)</i></b>. Old word from \pl&#275;ro&#333;\, to fill,<br>
 here that with which a thing is filled, whatever fills the earth.<br>
 <br>
 10:27 <B>{Biddeth you}</B> <b><i>(\kalei humas\)</i></b>. To a general banquet, but<br>
 not to a temple feast <b><i>(<!-#-->8:10)</i></b> which is prohibited. If a pagan<br>
 invites Christians to their homes to a banquet, one is to act<br>
 like a gentleman.<br>
 <br>
 10:28 <B>{But if any man say unto you}</B> <b><i>(\ean de tis humin eip&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Condition of third class. Suppose at such a banquet a "weak"<br>
 brother makes the point to you: "This hath been offered in<br>
 sacrifice" <b><i>(\touto hierothuton estin\)</i></b>. \Hierothuton\, late word<br>
 in Plutarch, rare in inscriptions and papyri, only here in N.T.<br>
 <B>{Eat not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; esthiete\)</i></b>. Present imperative with \m&#275;\<br>
 prohibiting the habit of eating then. Pertinent illustration to<br>
 the point of doing what is expedient and edifying. <B>{That shewed<br>
 it}</B> <b><i>(\ton m&#275;nusanta\)</i></b>. First aorist active articular participle<br>
 <b><i>(accusative case because of \dia\)</i></b> from \m&#275;nu&#333;\, old verb, to<br>
 point out, to disclose. See <!-#-->Lu 20:37.<br>
 <br>
 10:29 <B>{For why is my liberty judged by another conscience?}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hina ti gar h&#275; eleutheria mou krinetai hupo all&#275;s<br>
 suneid&#275;se&#333;s;\)</i></b>. Supply \gen&#275;tai\ <b><i>(deliberative subjunctive)</i></b> after<br>
 \ti\. Paul deftly puts himself in the place of the strong brother<br>
 at such a banquet who is expected to conform his conscience to<br>
 that of the weak brother who makes the point about a particular<br>
 piece of meat. It is an abridgment of one's personal liberty in<br>
 the interest of the weak brother. Two individualities clash. The<br>
 only reason is love which builds up <b><i>(<!-#-->8:2 and all of chapter<br>
 <!-#-->1Co 13)</i></b>. There is this eternal collision between the forces of<br>
 progress and reaction. If they work together, they must consider<br>
 the welfare of each other.<br>
 <br>
 10:30 Paul carries on the supposed objective to his principle of<br>
 love. Why incur the risk of being evil spoken of<br>
 <b><i>(\blasph&#275;moumai\)</i></b> for the sake of maintaining one's liberty? Is<br>
 it worth it? See <!-#-->Ro 14:6 where Paul justifies the conscience of<br>
 one who eats the meat and of one who does not. Saying grace over<br>
 food that one should not eat seems inconsistent. We have this<br>
 very word _blaspheme_ in English.<br>
 <br>
 10:31 <B>{To the glory of God}</B> <b><i>(\eis doxan theou\)</i></b>. This is the<br>
 ruling motive in the Christian's life, not just having his own<br>
 way about whims and preferences.<br>
 <br>
 10:32 <B>{Give no occasion of stumbling}</B> <b><i>(\aproskopoi\)</i></b>. Late word<br>
 and in papyri, only three times in N.T. <b><i>(here; <!-#-->Php 1:10; Ac<br>
 24:16)</i></b>. See on &#175;Acts 24:16. Here in active sense, not tripping<br>
 others by being a stumbling-block, as in Sirach 32:21, but<br>
 passive in <!-#-->Ac 24:16.<br>
 <br>
 10:33 <B>{Mine own profit}</B> <b><i>(\to emoutou sumpheron\)</i></b>. Old word from<br>
 \sumpher&#333;\, to bear together, and explains use of verb in verse<br>
 <!-#-->23. <B>{That they may be saved}</B> <b><i>(\hina s&#333;th&#333;sin\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive subjunctive of \s&#333;z&#333;\, to save, with \hina\ purpose<br>
 clause with same high motive as in <!-#-->9:22. This is the ruling<br>
 passion of Paul in his dealings with men.<br>
