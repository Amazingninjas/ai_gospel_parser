 <HR>
<p>2:1 <B>{Was now come}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i sunpl&#275;rousthai\)</i></b>. Luke's favourite<br>
 idiom of \en\ with the articular present infinitive passive and<br>
 the accusative of general reference, "in the being fulfilled<br>
 completely <b><i>(perfective use of \sun-\)</i></b> as to the day of<br>
 Pentecost." Common verb, but only in Luke in N.T. In literal<br>
 sense of filling a boat in <!-#-->Lu 8:23, about days in <!-#-->Lu 9:51 as<br>
 here. Whether the disciples expected the coming of the Holy<br>
 Spirit on this day we do not know. Blass holds that the present<br>
 tense shows that the day had not yet come. It is a Hebrew idiom<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 7:25)</i></b> and Luke may mean that the day of Pentecost was not<br>
 yet over, was still going on, though Hackett takes it for the<br>
 interval <b><i>(fifty days)</i></b> between Passover and Pentecost. Apparently<br>
 this day of Pentecost fell on the Jewish Sabbath <b><i>(our Saturday)</i></b>.<br>
 It was the feast of first fruits. <B>{All together in one place}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pantes homou epi to auto\)</i></b>. All together in the same place.<br>
 Note \homou\ here <b><i>(correct text)</i></b>, not \homothumadon\ as in<br>
 <!-#-->1:14, and so a bit of tautology.<br>
 <br>
 2:2 <B>{Suddenly}</B> <b><i>(\aphn&#333;\)</i></b>. Old adverb, but in the N.T. only in<br>
 Acts <b><i>(<!-#-->2:2; 16:26; 28:6)</i></b>. Kin to \exaiphn&#275;s\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 22:61)</i></b>. <B>{A<br>
 sound}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;chos\)</i></b>. Our \echo\. Old word, already in <!-#-->Lu 4:37 for<br>
 rumour and <!-#-->Lu 21:25 for the roar of the sea. It was not wind,<br>
 but a roar or reverberation "as of the rushing of a mighty wind"<br>
 <b><i>(\h&#333;sper pheromen&#275;s pno&#275;s biaias\)</i></b>. This is not a strict<br>
 translation nor is it the genitive absolute. It was "an echoing<br>
 sound as of a mighty wind borne violently" <b><i>(or rushing along like<br>
 the whirr of a tornado)</i></b>. \Pno&#275;\ <b><i>(wind)</i></b> is used here <b><i>(in the N.T.<br>
 only here and <!-#-->17:25 though old word)</i></b> probably because of the<br>
 use of \pneuma\ in verse <!-#-->4 of the Holy Spirit. In <!-#-->Joh 3:5-8<br>
 \pneuma\ occurs for both wind and Spirit. <B>{Filled}</B> <b><i>(\epl&#275;r&#333;sen\)</i></b>.<br>
 "As a bath is filled with water, that they might be baptized with<br>
 the Holy Ghost, in fulfilment of <!-#-->Ac 1:5" <b><i>(Canon Cook)</i></b>. <B>{They<br>
 were sitting}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san kath&#275;menoi\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect middle<br>
 of \kath&#275;mai\.<br>
 <br>
 2:3 <B>{Parting asunder}</B> <b><i>(\diamerizomenai\)</i></b>. Present middle <b><i>(or<br>
 passive)</i></b> participle of \diameriz&#333;\, old verb, to cleave asunder,<br>
 to cut in pieces as a butcher does meat <b><i>(aorist passive in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 11:17f.)</i></b>. So middle here would mean, parting themselves asunder<br>
 or distributing themselves. The passive voice would be "being<br>
 distributed." The middle is probably correct and means that "the<br>
 fire-like appearance presented itself at first, as it were, in a<br>
 single body, and then suddenly parted in this direction and that;<br>
 so that a portion of it rested on each of those present"<br>
 <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>. The idea is not that each tongue was cloven, but each<br>
 separate tongue looked like fire, not real fire, but looking like<br>
 <b><i>(\h&#333;sei\, as if)</i></b> fire. The audible sign is followed by a visible<br>
 one <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. "Fire had always been, with the Jews, the symbol<br>
 of the Divine presence <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ex 3:2; De 5:4)</i></b>. No symbol could be<br>
 more fitting to express the Spirit's purifying energy and<br>
 refining energy" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. The Baptist had predicted a<br>
 baptizing by the Messiah in the Holy Spirit and in fire <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 3:11)</i></b>. <B>{It sat}</B> <b><i>(\ekathisen\)</i></b>. Singular verb here, though plural<br>
 \&#333;pth&#275;san\ with tongues <b><i>(\gl&#333;ssai\)</i></b>. A tongue that looked like<br>
 fire sat upon each one.<br>
 <br>
 2:4 <B>{With other tongues}</B> <b><i>(\heterais gl&#333;ssais\)</i></b>. Other than their<br>
 native tongues. Each one began to speak in a language that he had<br>
 not acquired and yet it was a real language and understood by<br>
 those from various lands familiar with them. It was not jargon,<br>
 but intelligible language. Jesus had said that the gospel was to<br>
 go to all the nations and here the various tongues of earth were<br>
 spoken. One might conclude that this was the way in which the<br>
 message was to be carried to the nations, but future developments<br>
 disprove it. This is a third miracle <b><i>(the sound, the tongues like<br>
 fire, the untaught languages)</i></b>. There is no blinking the fact that<br>
 Luke so pictures them. One need not be surprised if this occasion<br>
 marks the fulfilment of the Promise of the Father. But one is not<br>
 to confound these miraculous signs with the Holy Spirit. They are<br>
 merely proof that he has come to carry on the work of his<br>
 dispensation. The gift of tongues came also on the house of<br>
 Cornelius at Caesarea <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10:44-47; 11:15-17)</i></b>, the disciples of<br>
 John at Ephesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 19:6)</i></b>, the disciples at Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 14:1-33)</i></b>. It is possible that the gift appeared also at Samaria<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 8:18)</i></b>. But it was not a general or a permanent gift. Paul<br>
 explains in <!-#-->1Co 14:22 that "tongues" were a sign to unbelievers<br>
 and were not to be exercised unless one was present who<br>
 understood them and could translate them. This restriction<br>
 disposes at once of the modern so-called tongues which are<br>
 nothing but jargon and hysteria. It so happened that here on this<br>
 occasion at Pentecost there were Jews from all parts of the<br>
 world, so that some one would understand one tongue and some<br>
 another without an interpreter such as was needed at Corinth. The<br>
 experience is identical in all four instances and they are not<br>
 for edification or instruction, but for adoration and wonder and<br>
 worship. <B>{As the Spirit gave them utterance}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s to pneuma<br>
 edidou apophtheggesthai autois\)</i></b>. This is precisely what Paul<br>
 claims in <!-#-->1Co 12:10,28, but all the same without an interpreter<br>
 the gift was not to be exercised <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 14:6-19)</i></b>. Paul had the<br>
 gift of tongues, but refused to exercise it except as it would be<br>
 understood. Note the imperfect tense here <b><i>(\edidou\)</i></b>. Perhaps<br>
 they did not all speak at once, but one after another.<br>
 \Apophtheggesthai\ is a late verb <b><i>(LXX of prophesying, papyri)</i></b>.<br>
 Lucian uses it of the ring of a vessel when it strikes a reef. It<br>
 is used of eager, elevated, impassioned utterance. In the N.T.<br>
 only here, verse <!-#-->14; 26:25. \Apophthegm\ is from this verb.<br>
 <br>
 2:5 <B>{Were dwelling}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san katoikountes\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect<br>
 active indicative. Usually \katoike&#333;\ means residence in a place<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->4:16; 7:24; 9:22,32)</i></b> as in verse <!-#-->14 <b><i>(<!-#-->Luke 13:4)</i></b>. Perhaps<br>
 some had come to Jerusalem to live while others were here only<br>
 temporarily, for the same word occurs in verse <!-#-->9 of those who<br>
 dwell in Mesopotamia, etc. <B>{Devout}</B> <b><i>(\eulabeis\)</i></b>. Reverent <b><i>(\eu\,<br>
 well, \lamban&#333;\, to take)</i></b>. See on &#175;Lu 2:25 like Simeon waiting<br>
 for the consolation of Israel or hoping to die and be buried in<br>
 the Holy City and also <!-#-->Ac 8:2.<br>
 <br>
 2:6 <B>{When this sound was heard}</B> <b><i>(\genomen&#275;s t&#275;s ph&#333;n&#275;s taut&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute with aorist middle participle. Note \ph&#333;n&#275;\<br>
 this time, not \&#275;cho\ as in verse <!-#-->1. \Ph&#333;n&#275;\ originally meant<br>
 sound as of the wind <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 3:8)</i></b> or an instrument <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 14:7,8,10)</i></b>, then voice of men. The meaning seems to be that the<br>
 excited "other tongues" of verse <!-#-->4 were so loud that the noise<br>
 drew the crowd together. The house where the 120 were may have<br>
 been <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b> on one of the avenues leading to the temple. <B>{Were<br>
 confounded}</B> <b><i>(\sunechuth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of<br>
 \sunche&#333;\ or \sunchun&#333;\, to pour together precisely like the<br>
 Latin _confundo_, to confound. The Vulgate has it _mente confusa<br>
 est_. It is an old verb, but in the N.T. only in Acts five times<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2:6; 9:22; 19:32; 21:27,31)</i></b>. <B>{In his own language}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i idi&#257;i<br>
 dialekt&#333;i\)</i></b>. Locative case. Each one could understand his own<br>
 language when he heard that. Every one that came heard somebody<br>
 speaking in his native tongue.<br>
 <br>
 2:7 <B>{Were amazed}</B> <b><i>(\existanto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of \exist&#275;mi\,<br>
 to stand out of themselves, wide-open astonishment. <B>{Marvelled}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ethaumazon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. The wonder grew and grew.<br>
 <B>{Galileans}</B> <b><i>(\Galilaioi\)</i></b>. There were few followers of Jesus as<br>
 yet from Jerusalem. The Galileans spoke a rude Aramaic <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 14:70)</i></b> and probably crude Greek vernacular also. They were not<br>
 strong on language and yet these are the very people who now show<br>
 such remarkable linguistic powers. These people who have come<br>
 together are all Jews and therefore know Aramaic and the<br>
 vernacular _Koin&#275;_, but there were various local tongues "wherein<br>
 we were born" <b><i>(\en h&#275;i egenn&#275;th&#275;men\)</i></b>. An example is the<br>
 Lycaonian <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 14:11)</i></b>. These Galilean Christians are now heard<br>
 speaking these various local tongues. The lists in verses <!-#-->9-11<br>
 are not linguistic, but geographical and merely illustrate how<br>
 widespread the Dispersion <b><i>(\Diaspora\)</i></b> of the Jews was as<br>
 represented on this occasion. Jews were everywhere, these "Jews<br>
 among the nations" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 21:21)</i></b>. Page notes four main divisions<br>
 here: <b><i>(I)</i></b> The Eastern or Babylonian, like the Parthians, Medes,<br>
 Elamites, Mesopotamians. <b><i>(2)</i></b> The Syrian like Judea, Cappadocia,<br>
 Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia. <b><i>(3)</i></b> The Egyptian like Egypt,<br>
 Libya, Cyrene. <b><i>(4)</i></b> The Roman. <B>{Jews and proselytes}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pros&#275;lutoi\)</i></b>. These last from \proserchomai\, to come to, to<br>
 join, Gentile converts to Judaism <b><i>(circumcision, baptism,<br>
 sacrifice)</i></b>. This proselyte baptism was immersion as is shown by<br>
 I. Abrahams <b><i>(_Studies in Pharisaism and the Gospels_, p. 38)</i></b>.<br>
 Many remained uncircumcised and were called proselytes of the<br>
 gate.<br>
 <br>
 2:11 <B>{Cretes and Arabians}</B>. These two groups "seem to have been<br>
 added to the list as an afterthought" <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. Crete is an<br>
 island to itself and Arabia was separate also though near Judea<br>
 and full of Jews. The point is not that each one of these groups<br>
 of Jews spoke a different language, but that wherever there was a<br>
 local tongue they heard men speaking in it. <B>{We do hear them<br>
 speaking}</B> <b><i>(\akouomen lalount&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive case \aut&#333;n\<br>
 with \akou&#333;\ the participle \lalount&#333;n\ agreeing with \aut&#333;n\, a<br>
 sort of participial idiom of indirect discourse <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, pp. 1040ff.)</i></b>. <B>{The mighty works}</B> <b><i>(\ta megaleia\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 adjective for magnificent. In LXX, but only here <b><i>(not genuine in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 1:49)</i></b> in the N.T. Cf. <!-#-->2Pe 1:16 for \megaleiot&#275;s\<br>
 <b><i>(majesty)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:12 <B>{Were perplexed}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;porounto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of<br>
 \diapore&#333;\ <b><i>(\dia\, \a\ privative, \poros\)</i></b> to be wholly at a<br>
 loss. Old verb, but in N.T. only in Luke and Acts. They continued<br>
 amazed <b><i>(\existanto\)</i></b> and puzzled. <B>{What meaneth this?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti<br>
 thelei touto einai\)</i></b>. Literally, what does this wish to be?<br>
 <br>
 2:13 <B>{Mocking}</B> <b><i>(\diachleuazontes\)</i></b>. Old verb, but only here in<br>
 the N.T., though the simple verb <b><i>(without \dia\)</i></b> in <!-#-->17:32.<br>
 \Chleu&#275;\ means a joke. <B>{With new wine}</B> <b><i>(\gleukous\)</i></b>. Sweet wine,<br>
 but intoxicating. Sweet wine kept a year was very intoxicating.<br>
 Genitive case here after \memest&#333;menoi eisin\ <b><i>(periphrastic<br>
 perfect passive indicative)</i></b>, old verb \mesto&#333;\, only here in the<br>
 N.T. Tanked up with new wine, state of fulness.<br>
 <br>
 2:14 <B>{Standing up with the eleven}</B> <b><i>(\statheis sun tois hendeka\)</i></b>.<br>
 Took his stand with the eleven including Matthias, who also rose<br>
 up with them, and spoke as their spokesman, a formal and<br>
 impressive beginning. The Codex Bezae has "ten apostles." Luke is<br>
 fond of this pictorial use of \statheis\ <b><i>(first aorist passive<br>
 participle of \hist&#275;mi\)</i></b> as seen nowhere else in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 18:11,40; 19:8; Ac 5:20; 17:22; 27:21)</i></b>. <B>{Lifted up his voice}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ep&#275;ren t&#275;n ph&#333;n&#275;n autou\)</i></b>. This phrase only in Luke in the N.T.<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 11:29; Ac 2:14; 14:11; 22:22)</i></b>, but is common in the old<br>
 writers. First aorist active indicative of \epair&#333;\. The large<br>
 crowd and the confusion of tongues demanded loud speaking. "This<br>
 most solemn, earnest, yet sober speech" <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>. Codex Bezae<br>
 adds "first" after "voice." Peter did it to win and hold<br>
 attention. <B>{Give ear unto my words}</B> <b><i>(\en&#333;tisasthe ta rh&#275;mata<br>
 mou\)</i></b>. Late verb in LXX and only here in the N.T. First aorist<br>
 middle from \en&#333;tizomai\ <b><i>(\en, ous\, ear)</i></b> to give ear to, receive<br>
 into the ear. People's ears differ greatly, but in public speech<br>
 they have to be reached through the ear. That puts an obligation<br>
 on the speaker and also on the auditors who should sit where they<br>
 can hear with the ears which they have, an obligation often<br>
 overlooked.<br>
 <br>
 2:15 <B>{As ye suppose}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s humeis hupolambanete\)</i></b>. Note use of<br>
 \humeis\ <b><i>(ye)</i></b> for decided emphasis. <B>{The third hour}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ra<br>
 trit&#275;\)</i></b>. Three o'clock in the day Jewish time, nine Roman.<br>
 Drunkenness belongs to the night <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 5:7)</i></b>. It was a quick,<br>
 common sense reply, and complete answer to their suspicion.<br>
 <br>
 2:16 <B>{This is that which hath been spoken by the prophet Joel}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\touto estin to eir&#275;menon dia tou proph&#275;tou I&#333;&#275;l\)</i></b>. Positive<br>
 interpretation of the supernatural phenomena in the light of the<br>
 Messianic prophecy of <!-#-->Joe 2:28-32. Peter's mind is now opened<br>
 by the Holy Spirit to understand the Messianic prophecy and the<br>
 fulfilment right before their eyes. Peter now has spiritual<br>
 insight and moral courage. The <B>{power}</B> <b><i>(\dunamis\)</i></b> of the Holy<br>
 Spirit has come upon him as he proceeds to give the first<br>
 interpretation of the life and work of Jesus Christ since his<br>
 Ascension. It is also the first formal apology for Christianity<br>
 to a public audience. Peter rises to the height of his powers in<br>
 this remarkable sermon. Jesus had foretold that he would be a<br>
 Rock and now he is no longer shale, but a solid force for<br>
 aggressive Christianity. He follows here in verses <!-#-->17-21<br>
 closely the LXX text of Joel and then applies the passage to the<br>
 present emergency <b><i>(<!-#-->22-24)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:17 <B>{In the last days}</B> <b><i>(\en tais eschatais h&#275;merais\)</i></b>. Joel does<br>
 not have precisely these words, but he defines "those days" as<br>
 being "the day of the Lord" <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Isa 2:2; Mic 4:1)</i></b>. <B>{I will<br>
 pour forth}</B> <b><i>(\ekche&#333;\)</i></b>. Future active indicative of \ekche&#333;\.<br>
 This future like \edomai\ and \piomai\ is without tense sign,<br>
 probably like the present in the futuristic sense <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 354)</i></b>. Westcott and Hort put a different accent on<br>
 the future, but the old Greek had no accent. The old Greek had<br>
 \ekcheus&#333;\. This verb means to pour out. <B>{Of my Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\apo tou<br>
 pneumatos\)</i></b>. This use of \apo\ <b><i>(of)</i></b> is either because of the<br>
 variety in the manifestations of the Spirit <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 12)</i></b> or because<br>
 the Spirit in his entirety remains with God <b><i>(Holtzmann, Wendt)</i></b>.<br>
 But the Hebrew has it: "I will pour out my Spirit" without the<br>
 partitive idea in the LXX. <B>{And your daughters}</B> <b><i>(\kai hai<br>
 thugateres h&#8211;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. Anna is called a prophetess in <!-#-->Lu 2:36 and<br>
 the daughters of Philip prophesy <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 21:9)</i></b> and verse <!-#-->18<br>
 <b><i>(handmaidens)</i></b>. See also <!-#-->1Co 11:5 <b><i>(\proph&#275;tousa\)</i></b>. <B>{Visions}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\horaseis\)</i></b>. Late word for the more common \horama\, both from<br>
 \hora&#333;\, to see. In <!-#-->Re 4:3 it means appearance, but in <!-#-->Re<br>
 9:17 as here an ecstatic revelation or vision. <B>{Dream dreams}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\enupniois enupniasth&#275;sontai\)</i></b>. Shall dream with <b><i>(instrumental<br>
 case)</i></b> dreams. First future passive of \enupniaz&#333;\ from \enupnios\<br>
 <b><i>(\en\ and \hupnos\, in sleep)</i></b>, a common late word. Only here in<br>
 the N.T. <b><i>(this from Joel as all these verses <!-#-->17-21 are)</i></b> and<br>
 <!-#-->Jude 1:8. <B>{Yea and}</B> <b><i>(\kai ge\)</i></b>. Intensive particle \ge\ added<br>
 to \kai\ <b><i>(and)</i></b>, an emphatic addition <b><i>(=Hebrew _vegam_)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Servants}</B> <b><i>(\doulous\)</i></b>, <B>{handmaidens}</B> <b><i>(\doulas\)</i></b>. Slaves, actual<br>
 slaves of men. The humblest classes will receive the Spirit of<br>
 God <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1Co 1:26-31)</i></b>. But the word "prophesy" here is not in<br>
 the LXX <b><i>(or the Hebrew)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:19 <B>{Wonders}</B> <b><i>(\terata\)</i></b>. Apparently akin to the verb \t&#275;re&#333;\,<br>
 to watch like a wonder in the sky, <B>{miracle}</B> <b><i>(\miraculum\)</i></b>,<br>
 marvel, portent. In the New Testament the word occurs only in the<br>
 plural and only in connection with \s&#275;meia\ <b><i>(signs)</i></b> as here and<br>
 in verse <!-#-->43. But <B>{signs}</B> <b><i>(\s&#275;meia\)</i></b> here is not in the LXX. See<br>
 on <!-#-->Mt 11:20. In verse <!-#-->22 all three words occur together:<br>
 powers, wonders, signs <b><i>(\dunamesi, terasi, s&#275;meiois\)</i></b>. <B>{As above}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\an&#333;\)</i></b>. This word is not in the LXX nor is "beneath" <b><i>(\kat&#333;\)</i></b>,<br>
 both probably being added to make clearer the contrast between<br>
 heaven and earth. <B>{Blood and fire and vapour of smoke}</B> <b><i>(\haima<br>
 kai pur kai atmida kapnou\)</i></b>. A chiasm as these words illustrate<br>
 bloodshed and destruction by fire as signs here on earth.<br>
 <br>
 2:20 <B>{Shall be turned}</B> <b><i>(\metastraph&#275;setai\)</i></b>. Second future<br>
 passive of \metastreph&#333;\, common verb, but only three times in<br>
 the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 2:20 from Joel; <!-#-->Jas 4:9; Ga 1:7)</i></b>. These are the<br>
 "wonders" or portents of verse <!-#-->19. It is worth noting that<br>
 Peter interprets these "portents" as fulfilled on the Day of<br>
 Pentecost, though no such change of the sun into darkness or of<br>
 the moon into blood is recorded. Clearly Peter does not interpret<br>
 the symbolism of Joel in literal terms. This method of Peter may<br>
 be of some service in the Book of Revelation where so many<br>
 apocalyptic symbols occur as well as in the great Eschatological<br>
 Discourse of Jesus in <!-#-->Mt 24,25. In <!-#-->Mt 24:6,29 Jesus had<br>
 spoken of wars on earth and wonders in heaven. <B>{Before the day of<br>
 the Lord come, that great and notable day}</B> <b><i>(\prin elthein h&#275;meran<br>
 kuriou t&#275;n megal&#275;n kai epiphan&#275;\)</i></b>. The use of \prin\ with the<br>
 infinitive and the accusative of general reference is a regular<br>
 Greek idiom. The use of the adjectives with the article is also<br>
 good Greek, though the article is not here repeated as in <!-#-->1:25.<br>
 The Day of the Lord is a definite conception without the article.<br>
 <B>{Notable}</B> <b><i>(\epiphan&#275;\)</i></b> is the same root as epiphany<br>
 <b><i>(\epiphaneia\)</i></b> used of the Second Coming of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 2:8; 1Ti<br>
 6:14; 2Ti 4:1; Tit 2:13)</i></b>. It translates here the Hebrew word for<br>
 "terrible." In the Epistles the Day of the Lord is applied<br>
 <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b> to the Coming of Christ for judgment <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 5:2; 1Co<br>
 1:8; 2Co 1:14; Php 1:10)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:21 <B>{Shall call on}</B> <b><i>(\epikales&#275;tai\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 subjunctive of \epikale&#333;\, common verb, to call to, middle voice<br>
 for oneself in need. Indefinite relative clause with \ean\ and so<br>
 subjunctive, punctiliar idea, in any single case, and so aorist.<br>
 <br>
 2:22 <B>{Hear these words}</B> <b><i>(\akousate tous logous toutous\)</i></b>. Do it<br>
 now <b><i>(aorist tense)</i></b>. With unerring aim Peter has found the<br>
 solution for the phenomena. He has found the key to God's work on<br>
 this day in his words through Joel. <B>{as ye yourselves know}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kath&#333;s autoi oidate\)</i></b>. Note \autoi\ for emphasis. Peter calls<br>
 the audience to witness that his statements are true concerning<br>
 "Jesus the Nazarene." He wrought his miracles by the power of God<br>
 in the midst of these very people here present.<br>
 <br>
 2:23 <B>{Him}</B> <b><i>(\touton\)</i></b>. "This one," resumptive and emphatic object<br>
 of "did crucify and slay." <B>{Being delivered up}</B> <b><i>(\ekdoton\)</i></b>.<br>
 Verbal adjective from \ekdid&#333;mi\, to give out or over. Old word,<br>
 but here only in the N.T. Delivered up by Judas, Peter means. <B>{By<br>
 the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i<br>
 h&#333;rismen&#275;i boul&#275;i kai progn&#333;s&#275;i tou theou\)</i></b>. Instrumental case.<br>
 Note both purpose <b><i>(\boul&#275;\)</i></b> and foreknowledge <b><i>(\progn&#333;sis\)</i></b> of<br>
 God and "determined" <b><i>(\h&#333;rismen&#275;\, perfect passive participle,<br>
 state of completion)</i></b>. God had willed the death of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 3:16)</i></b> and the death of Judas <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 1:16)</i></b>, but that fact did not<br>
 absolve Judas from his responsibility and guilt <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:22)</i></b>. He<br>
 acted as a free moral agent. <B>{By the hand}</B> <b><i>(\dia cheiros\)</i></b>. Luke<br>
 is fond of these figures <b><i>(hand, face, etc.)</i></b> very much like the<br>
 Hebrew though the vernacular of all languages uses them. <B>{Lawless<br>
 men}</B> <b><i>(\anom&#333;n\)</i></b>. Men without law, who recognize no law for their<br>
 conduct, like men in high and low stations today who defy the<br>
 laws of God and man. Old word, very common in the LXX. <B>{Ye did<br>
 crucify}</B> <b><i>(\prosp&#275;xantes\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle of<br>
 \prosp&#275;gnumi\, rare compound word in Dio Cassius and here only in<br>
 the N.T. One must supply \t&#333;i staur&#333;i\ and so it means "fastened<br>
 to the cross," a graphic picture like Paul's "nailed to the<br>
 cross" <b><i>(\pros&#275;l&#333;sas t&#333;i staur&#333;i\)</i></b> in <!-#-->Col 2:14. <B>{Did slay}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aneilate\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative with first aorist<br>
 vowel \a\ instead of \o\ as is common in the _Koin&#275;_. This verb<br>
 \anaire&#333;\, to take up, is often used for kill as in <!-#-->Ac 12:2.<br>
 Note Peter's boldness now under the power of the Holy Spirit. He<br>
 charges the people to their faces with the death of Christ.<br>
 <br>
 2:24 <B>{God raised up}</B> <b><i>(\ho theos anest&#275;sen\)</i></b>. _Est hoc summum<br>
 orationis_ <b><i>(Blass)</i></b>. Apparently this is the first public<br>
 proclamation to others than believers of the fact of the<br>
 Resurrection of Jesus. "At a time it was still possible to test<br>
 the statement, to examine witnesses, to expose fraud, the Apostle<br>
 openly proclaimed the Resurrection as a fact, needing no<br>
 evidence, but known to his hearers" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. <B>{The pangs of<br>
 death}</B> <b><i>(\tas &#333;dinas tou thanatou\)</i></b>. Codex Bezae has "Hades"<br>
 instead of death. The LXX has \&#333;dinas thanatou\ in <!-#-->Ps 18:4, but<br>
 the Hebrew original means "snares" or "traps" or "cords" of death<br>
 where sheol and death are personified as hunters laying snares<br>
 for prey. How Peter or Luke came to use the old Greek word<br>
 \&#333;dinas\ <b><i>(birth pangs)</i></b> we do not know. Early Christian writers<br>
 interpreted the Resurrection of Christ as a birth out of death.<br>
 "Loosing" <b><i>(\lusas\)</i></b> suits better the notion of "snares" held a<br>
 prisoner by death, but birth pangs do bring deliverance to the<br>
 mother also. <B>{Because}</B> <b><i>(\kathoti\)</i></b>. This old conjunction <b><i>(\kata,<br>
 hoti\)</i></b> occurs in the N.T. only in Luke's writings. <B>{That he<br>
 should be holden}</B> <b><i>(\krateisthai auton\)</i></b>. Infinitive present<br>
 passive with accusative of general reference and subject of \&#275;n<br>
 adunaton\. The figure goes with "loosed" <b><i>(\lusas\)</i></b> above.<br>
 <br>
 2:25 <B>{Concerning him}</B> <b><i>(\eis auton\)</i></b>. Peter interprets <!-#-->Ps<br>
 16:8-11 as written by David and with reference to the Messiah.<br>
 There is but one speaker in this Psalm and both Peter here and<br>
 Paul in <!-#-->Ac 13:36 make it the Messiah. David is giving his own<br>
 experience which is typical of the Messiah <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. <B>{I beheld}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\proor&#333;m&#275;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle without augment of \proora&#333;\,<br>
 common verb, but only twice in the N.T., to see beforehand <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 21:29)</i></b> or to see right before one as here. This idea of \pro-\<br>
 is made plainer by "before my face" <b><i>(\en&#333;pion mou\)</i></b>. <B>{On my right<br>
 hand}</B> <b><i>(\ek dexi&#333;n mou\)</i></b>. The Lord Jehovah like a defender or<br>
 advocate stands at David's right hand as in trials in court <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps<br>
 109:31)</i></b>. <B>{That}</B> <b><i>(\hina\)</i></b> here is almost result. <B>{Moved}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\saleuth&#333;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive subjunctive of \saleu&#333;\, to<br>
 shake like an earthquake.<br>
 <br>
 2:26 <B>{Was glad}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;uphranth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(timeless here like<br>
 the Hebrew perfect)</i></b> passive indicative of \euphrain&#333;\ <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Lu<br>
 15:32)</i></b>. Timeless also is "rejoiced" <b><i>(\&#275;galliasato\)</i></b>. <B>{Shall<br>
 dwell}</B> <b><i>(\katask&#275;n&#333;sei\)</i></b>. Shall tabernacle, pitch a tent, make<br>
 one's abode <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mt 13:32)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 8:20 about<br>
 \katask&#275;n&#333;seis\ <b><i>(nests)</i></b> <B>{In hope}</B> <b><i>(\ep' elpidi\)</i></b>. On hope, the<br>
 hope of the resurrection.<br>
 <br>
 2:27 <B>{In Hades}</B> <b><i>(\eis H&#257;id&#275;n\)</i></b>. Hades is the unseen world, Hebrew<br>
 Sheol, but here it is viewed as death itself "considered as a<br>
 rapacious destroyer" <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>. It does not mean the place of<br>
 punishment, though both heaven and the place of torment are in<br>
 Hades <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 16:23)</i></b>. "Death and Hades are strictly parallel terms:<br>
 he who is dead is in Hades" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. The use of \eis\ here=\en\ is<br>
 common enough. The Textus Receptus here reads \eis H&#257;idou\<br>
 <b><i>(genitive case)</i></b> like the Attic idiom with \domon\ <b><i>(abode)</i></b><br>
 understood. "Hades" in English is not translation, but<br>
 transliteration. The phrase in the Apostles' Creed, "descended<br>
 into hell" is from this passage in Acts <b><i>(Hades, not Gehenna)</i></b>. The<br>
 English word "hell" is Anglo-Saxon from \helan\, to hide, and was<br>
 used in the Authorized Version to translate both Hades as here<br>
 and Gehenna as in <!-#-->Mt 5:22. <B>{Thy Holy One}</B> <b><i>(\ton hosion sou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Peter applies these words to the Messiah. <B>{Corruption}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\diaphthoran\)</i></b>. The word can mean destruction or putrefaction<br>
 from \diaphtheir&#333;\, old word, but in N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ac<br>
 13:34-37. The Hebrew word in <!-#-->Ps 16 can mean also the pit or<br>
 the deep.<br>
 <br>
 2:28 <B>{The ways of life}</B> <b><i>(\hodous z&#333;&#275;s\)</i></b>. Though dead God will<br>
 show him the ways back to life.<br>
 <br>
 2:29 <B>{I may say}</B> <b><i>(\exon eipein\)</i></b>. Supply \estin\ before \exon\,<br>
 periphrastic present indicative of \exeimi\, to allow, permit.<br>
 The Authorized Version has "Let me speak," supplying \esto\<br>
 present imperative. <B>{Freely}</B> <b><i>(\meta parr&#275;sias\)</i></b>. Telling it all<br>
 <b><i>(\pan, rh&#275;sia\ from \eipon\, to speak)</i></b>, with fulness, with<br>
 boldness. Luke is fond of the phrase <b><i>(as in <!-#-->4:13)</i></b>. It is a new<br>
 start for Simon Peter, full of boldness and courage. <B>{The<br>
 patriarch}</B> <b><i>(\tou patriarchou\)</i></b>. Transliteration of the word, from<br>
 \patria\, family, and \arch&#333;\, to rule, the founder of a family.<br>
 Late word in LXX. Used of Abraham <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 7:4)</i></b>, of the twelve sons<br>
 of Jacob as founders of the several tribes <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 7:8)</i></b>, and here<br>
 of David as head of the family from whom the Messiah comes. <B>{Was<br>
 buried}</B> <b><i>(\etaph&#275;\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive indicative of \thapt&#333;\.<br>
 His tomb was on Mt. Zion where most of the kings were buried. The<br>
 tomb was said to have fallen into ruins in the time of the<br>
 Emperor Hadrian. Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. XVI. 7, 1)</i></b> attributes most of<br>
 the misfortunes of Herod's family to the fact that he tried to<br>
 rifle the tomb of David.<br>
 <br>
 2:31 <B>{Foreseeing}</B> <b><i>(\proid&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle.<br>
 Did it as a prophet. <B>{Of the Christ}</B> <b><i>(\tou Christou\)</i></b>. Of the<br>
 Messiah. See under verse <!-#-->32. This is a definite statement by<br>
 Peter that David knew that in <!-#-->Ps 16 he was describing the<br>
 resurrection of the Messiah.<br>
 <br>
 2:32 <B>{This Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\touton ton I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. Many of the name<br>
 "Jesus," but he means the one already called "the Nazarene"<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->22)</i></b> and foretold as the Messiah in <!-#-->Ps 16 and raised<br>
 from the dead by God in proof that he is the Messiah <b><i>(<!-#-->2:24,32)</i></b>,<br>
 "this Jesus whom ye crucified" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->36)</i></b>. Other terms used of<br>
 him in the Acts are the Messiah, verse <!-#-->31, the one whom God<br>
 "anointed" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10:38)</i></b>, as in <!-#-->Joh 1:41, Jesus Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->9:34)</i></b>.<br>
 In <!-#-->2:36 God made this Jesus Messiah, in <!-#-->3:20 the Messiah<br>
 Jesus, in <!-#-->17:3 Jesus is the Messiah, in <!-#-->18:5 the Messiah is<br>
 Jesus, in <!-#-->24:24 Christ Jesus. <B>{Whereof}</B> <b><i>(\hou\)</i></b>. Or "of whom."<br>
 Either makes sense and both are true. Peter claims the whole 120<br>
 as personal witnesses to the fact of the Resurrection of Jesus<br>
 from the dead and they are all present as Peter calls them to<br>
 witness on the point. In Galilee over 500 had seen the Risen<br>
 Christ at one time <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:6)</i></b> most of whom were still living<br>
 when Paul wrote. Thus the direct evidence for the resurrection of<br>
 Jesus piles up in cumulative force.<br>
 <br>
 2:33 <B>{By the right hand of God}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i dexi&#257;i tou theou\)</i></b>. This<br>
 translation makes it the instrumental case. The margin has it<br>
 "at" instead of "by," that is the locative case. And it will make<br>
 sense in the true dative case, "to the right hand of God." These<br>
 three cases came to have the same form in Greek. <!-#-->Ro 8:24<br>
 furnishes another illustration of like ambiguity <b><i>(\t&#275;i elpidi\)</i></b>,<br>
 saved by hope, in hope, or for hope. Usually it is quite easy to<br>
 tell the case when the form is identical. <B>{Exalted}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hups&#333;theis\)</i></b>. First aorist passive participle of \hupso&#333;\, to<br>
 lift up. Here both the literal and tropical sense occurs. Cf.<br>
 <!-#-->Joh 12:32. <B>{The promise of the Holy Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n epaggelian<br>
 tou pneumatos tou hagiou\)</i></b>. The promise mentioned in <!-#-->1:4 and<br>
 now come true, consisting in the Holy Spirit "from the Father"<br>
 <b><i>(\para tou patros\)</i></b>, sent by the Father and by the Son <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 15:26; 16:7)</i></b>. See also <!-#-->Ga 3:14. <B>{He hath poured forth}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\execheen\)</i></b>. Aorist active indicative of \ekche&#333;\ the verb used<br>
 by Joel and quoted by Peter already in verses <!-#-->17,18. Jesus has<br>
 fulfilled his promise. <B>{This which ye see and hear}</B> <b><i>(\touto ho<br>
 humeis kai blepete kai akouete\)</i></b>. This includes the sound like<br>
 the rushing wind, the tongues like fire on each of them, the<br>
 different languages spoken by the 120. "The proof was before<br>
 their eyes in this new energy from heaven" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>, a<br>
 culminating demonstration that Jesus was the Messiah.<br>
 <br>
 2:34 <B>{Ascended not}</B> <b><i>(\ou--aneb&#275;\)</i></b>. It is more emphatic than that:<br>
 For not David ascended into the heavens. Peter quotes <!-#-->Ps 110:1<br>
 as proof. No passage in the O.T. is so constantly quoted as<br>
 Messianic as this. "St. Peter does not demand belief upon his own<br>
 assertion, but he again appeals to the Scriptures, and to words<br>
 which could not have received a fulfilment in the case of David"<br>
 <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. <B>{Sit thou}</B> <b><i>(\kathou\)</i></b>. Late _Koin&#275;_ form for earlier<br>
 \kath&#275;so\, present middle imperative second singular of<br>
 \kath&#275;mai\.<br>
 <br>
 2:35 <B>{Till I make}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s an th&#333;\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 subjunctive of \tith&#275;mi\ with \an\ after \he&#333;s\ for the future, a<br>
 common Greek idiom. This dominion of Christ as Mediator will last<br>
 till the plan of the kingdom is carried out <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:23-28)</i></b>.<br>
 Complete subjugation will come, perhaps referring to the custom<br>
 of victorious kings placing their feet upon the necks of their<br>
 enemies <b><i>(<!-#-->Jos 10:24)</i></b>. <B>{Therefore assuredly}</B> <b><i>(\Asphal&#333;s oun\)</i></b>.<br>
 Assuredly therefore, without any slip or trip <b><i>(\asphal&#275;s\ from<br>
 \a\ privative and \sphall&#333;\, to trip, to slip. Peter draws a<br>
 powerfully pungent conclusion by the use of the adverb \asphal&#333;s\<br>
and the inferential conjunction \oun\.)</i></b> Peter's closing sentence<br>
 drives home the point of his sermon: "This very Jesus whom ye<br>
 crucified <b><i>(note \humeis\, strongly emphatic <B>{ye}</B>)</i></b>, him God made<br>
 both Lord and Messiah" <b><i>(\kai kurion kai Christon\)</i></b>, as David<br>
 foretold in <!-#-->Ps 110 and as the events of this day have<br>
 confirmed. The critics are disturbed over how Luke could have<br>
 gotten the substance of this masterful address spoken on the spur<br>
 of the moment with passion and power. They even say that Luke<br>
 composed it for Peter and put the words in his mouth. If so, he<br>
 made a good job of it. But Peter could have written out the notes<br>
 of the address afterwards. Luke had plenty of chances to get hold<br>
 of it from Peter or from others.<br>
 <br>
 2:37 <B>{They were pricked in their heart}</B> <b><i>(\katenug&#275;san t&#275;n<br>
 kardian\)</i></b>. Second aorist indicative of \katanuss&#333;\, a rare verb<br>
 <b><i>(LXX)</i></b> to pierce, to sting sharply, to stun, to smite. Homer used<br>
 it of horses dinting the earth with their hoofs. The substantive<br>
 \katanuxis\ occurs in <!-#-->Ro 11:8. Here only in the N.T. It is<br>
 followed here by the accusative of the part affected, the heart.<br>
 <B>{What shall we do?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti poi&#275;s&#333;men\)</i></b>. Deliberative subjunctive<br>
 first aorist active. The sermon went home, they felt the sting of<br>
 Peter's words, compunction <b><i>(\compungo\)</i></b>. Codex Bezae adds: "Show<br>
 us."<br>
 <br>
 2:38 <B>{Repent ye}</B> <b><i>(\metano&#275;sate\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b><br>
 active imperative. Change your mind and your life. Turn right<br>
 about and do it now. You _crucified_ this Jesus. Now _crown_ him<br>
 in your hearts as Lord and Christ. This first. <B>{And be baptized<br>
 every one of you}</B> <b><i>(\kai baptisth&#275;t&#333; hekastos h&#8211;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. Rather,<br>
 "And let each one of you be baptized." Change of number from<br>
 plural to singular and of person from second to third. This<br>
 change marks a break in the thought here that the English<br>
 translation does not preserve. The first thing to do is make a<br>
 radical and complete change of heart and life. Then let each one<br>
 be baptized after this change has taken place, and the act of<br>
 baptism be performed "in the name of Jesus Christ" <b><i>(\en t&#333;i<br>
 onomati I&#275;sou Christou\)</i></b>. In accordance with the command of Jesus<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 28:19 <b><i>(\eis to onoma\)</i></b>. No distinction is to be insisted<br>
 on between \eis to onoma\ and \en t&#333;i onomati\ with \baptiz&#333;\<br>
 since \eis\ and \en\ are really the same word in origin. In <!-#-->Ac<br>
 10:48 \en t&#333;i onomati I&#275;sou Christou\ occurs, but \eis\ to<br>
 \onoma\ in <!-#-->8:16; 19:5. The use of \onoma\ means in the name or<br>
 with the authority of one as \eis onoma proph&#275;tou\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:41)</i></b><br>
 as a prophet, in the name of a prophet. In the Acts the full name<br>
 of the Trinity does not occur in baptism as in <!-#-->Mt 28:19, but<br>
 this does not show that it was not used. The name of Jesus Christ<br>
 is the distinctive one in Christian baptism and really involves<br>
 the Father and the Spirit. See on &#175;Mt 28:19 for discussion of<br>
 this point. "Luke does not give the form of words used in baptism<br>
 by the Apostles, but merely states the fact that they baptized<br>
 those who acknowledged Jesus as Messiah or as Lord" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. <B>{Unto<br>
 the remission of your sins}</B> <b><i>(\eis aphesin t&#333;n hamarti&#333;n h&#8211;m&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 This phrase is the subject of endless controversy as men look at<br>
 it from the standpoint of sacramental or of evangelical theology.<br>
 In themselves the words can express aim or purpose for that use<br>
 of \eis\ does exist as in <!-#-->1Co 2:7 \eis doxan h&#275;m&#333;n\ <b><i>(for our<br>
 glory)</i></b>. But then another usage exists which is just as good Greek<br>
 as the use of \eis\ for aim or purpose. It is seen in <!-#-->Mt 10:41<br>
 in three examples \eis onoma proph&#275;tou, dikaiou, math&#275;tou\ where<br>
 it cannot be purpose or aim, but rather the basis or ground, on<br>
 the basis of the name of prophet, righteous man, disciple,<br>
 because one is, etc. It is seen again in <!-#-->Mt 12:41 about the<br>
 preaching of Jonah <b><i>(\eis to k&#275;rugma I&#333;na\)</i></b>. They repented because<br>
 of <b><i>(or at)</i></b> the preaching of Jonah. The illustrations of both<br>
 usages are numerous in the N.T. and the _Koin&#275;_ generally<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 592)</i></b>. One will decide the use here<br>
 according as he believes that baptism is essential to the<br>
 remission of sins or not. My view is decidedly against the idea<br>
 that Peter, Paul, or any one in the New Testament taught baptism<br>
 as essential to the remission of sins or the means of securing<br>
 such remission. So I understand Peter to be urging baptism on<br>
 each of them who had already turned <b><i>(repented)</i></b> and for it to be<br>
 done in the name of Jesus Christ on the basis of the forgiveness<br>
 of sins which they had already received. <B>{The gift of the Holy<br>
 Ghost}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n d&#333;rean tou hagiou pneumatos\)</i></b>. The gift consists<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 8:17)</i></b> in the Holy Spirit <b><i>(genitive of identification)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:39 <B>{The promise}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; epaggelia\)</i></b>. The promise made by Jesus<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1:4)</i></b> and foretold by Joel <b><i>(verse <!-#-->18)</i></b>. <B>{To you}</B> <b><i>(\humin\)</i></b>.<br>
 You Jews. To your descendants, sons and daughters of verse <!-#-->17.<br>
 <B>{To all that are afar off}</B> <b><i>(\p&#257;sin tois eis makran\.)</i></b> The horizon<br>
 widens and includes the Gentiles. Those "afar off" from the Jews<br>
 were the heathen <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 49:1; 57:19; Eph 2:13,17)</i></b>. The rabbis so<br>
 used it. <B>{Shall call}</B> <b><i>(\an proskales&#275;tai\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 subjunctive with \an\ in an indefinite relative clause, a<br>
 perfectly regular construction. The Lord God calls men of every<br>
 nation anywhere whether Jews or Gentiles. It may be doubted how<br>
 clearly Peter grasped the significance of these words for he will<br>
 have trouble over this very matter on the housetop in Joppa and<br>
 in Caesarea, but he will see before long the full sweep of the<br>
 great truth that he here proclaims under the impulse of the Holy<br>
 Spirit. It was a great moment that Peter here reaches.<br>
 <br>
 2:40 <B>{With many other words}</B> <b><i>(\heterois logois pleiosin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Instrumental case. Not necessarily "different" <b><i>(\heterois\)</i></b>, but<br>
 "further," showing that Luke does not pretend to give all that<br>
 Peter said. This idea is also brought out clearly by \pleiosin\<br>
 <b><i>("more," not "many")</i></b>, more than these given by Luke. <B>{He<br>
 testified}</B> <b><i>(\diemarturato\)</i></b>. First aorist middle of<br>
 \diamarturomai\, old verb, to make solemn attestation or call to<br>
 witness <b><i>(perfective use of \dia\)</i></b>, while \marture&#333;\ is to bear<br>
 witness. Page insists that here it should be translated<br>
 "protested solemnly" to the Jews as it seems to mean in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 16:28; Ac 20:23; 1Ti 5:21; 2Ti 2:14; 4:1. <B>{And exhorted}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 parekalei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, kept on exhorting. <B>{Save<br>
 yourselves}</B> <b><i>(\s&#333;th&#275;te\)</i></b>. First aorist passive of \s&#333;z&#333;\.<br>
 Literally, Be ye saved. <B>{Crooked}</B> <b><i>(\skolias\)</i></b>. Old word, opposite<br>
 of \orthos\, straight. _Pravus_ the opposite of _rectus_, a<br>
 perversity for turning off from the truth. Cf. <!-#-->Lu 9:41; Php<br>
 2:15.<br>
 <br>
 2:41 <B>{They then}</B> <b><i>(\Hoi men oun\)</i></b>. A common phrase in Acts either<br>
 without antithesis as in <!-#-->1:6; 5:41; 8:4,25; 9:31; 11:19; 16:5;<br>
 or with it as here, <!-#-->8:25; 13:4; 14:3; 17:17; 23:31; 25:4. \Oun\<br>
 connects with what precedes as the result of Peter's sermon while<br>
 \men\ points forward to what is to follow. <B>{Were baptized}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ebaptisth&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative, constative<br>
 aorist. Note that only those who had already received the word<br>
 and were converted were baptized. <B>{There were added}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\proseteth&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of<br>
 \prostith&#275;mi\, old verb to add, to join to. Luke means that the<br>
 3,000 were added to the 120 already enlisted. It is not stated<br>
 they were all baptized by Peter or the twelve or all on the same<br>
 day, though that is the natural implication of the language. The<br>
 numerous pools in Jerusalem afforded ample opportunity for such<br>
 wholesale baptizing and Hackett notes that the habit of orientals<br>
 would place no obstacle in the way of the use of the public<br>
 reservoirs. Furneaux warns us that all the 3,000 may not have<br>
 been genuine converts and that many of them were pilgrims at the<br>
 passover who returned home. <B>{Souls}</B> <b><i>(\psuchai\)</i></b>. Persons as in<br>
 verse <!-#-->43.<br>
 <br>
 2:42 <B>{They continued steadfastly}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san proskarturountes\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic active imperfect of \proskarture&#333;\ as in <!-#-->Ac 1:14<br>
 <b><i>(same participle in verse <!-#-->46)</i></b>. <B>{Fellowship}</B> <b><i>(\koin&#333;ni&#257;i\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 word from \koin&#333;nos\ <b><i>(partner, sharer in common interest)</i></b> and<br>
 this from \koinos\ what is common to all. This partnership<br>
 involves participation in, as the blood of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 2:1)</i></b> or<br>
 co-operation in the work of the gospel <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 1:5)</i></b> or<br>
 contribution for those in need <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 8:4; 9:13)</i></b>. Hence there is<br>
 wide diversity of opinion concerning the precise meaning of<br>
 \koin&#333;nia\ in this verse. It may refer to the distribution of<br>
 funds in verse <!-#-->44 or to the oneness of spirit in the community<br>
 of believers or to the Lord's Supper <b><i>(as in <!-#-->1Co 10:16)</i></b> in the<br>
 sense of communion or to the fellowship in the common meals or<br>
 \agapae\ <b><i>(love-feasts)</i></b>. <B>{The breaking of bread}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i klasei tou<br>
 artou\)</i></b>. The word \klasis\ is an old word, but used only by Luke<br>
 in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:35; Ac 2:42)</i></b>, though the verb \kla&#333;\ occurs<br>
 in other parts of the N.T. as in verse <!-#-->46. The problem here is<br>
 whether Luke refers to the ordinary meal as in <!-#-->Lu 24:35 or to<br>
 the Lord's Supper. The same verb \kla&#333;\ is used of breaking bread<br>
 at the ordinary meal <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:30)</i></b> or the Lord's Supper <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 22:19)</i></b>. It is generally supposed that the early disciples<br>
 attached so much significance to the breaking of bread at the<br>
 ordinary meals, more than our saying grace, that they followed<br>
 the meal with the Lord's Supper at first, a combination called<br>
 \agapai\ or love-feasts. "There can be no doubt that the<br>
 Eucharist at this period was preceded uniformly by a common<br>
 repast, as was the case when the ordinance was instituted"<br>
 <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>. This led to some abuses as in <!-#-->1Co 11:20. Hence it is<br>
 possible that what is referred to here is the Lord's Supper<br>
 following the ordinary meal. "To simply explain \t&#275;i klasei tou<br>
 artou\ as='The Holy Communion' is to pervert the plain meaning of<br>
 words, and to mar the picture of family life, which the text<br>
 places before us as the ideal of the early believers" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. But<br>
 in <!-#-->Ac 20:7 they seem to have come together especially for the<br>
 observance of the Lord's Supper. Perhaps there is no way to<br>
 settle the point conclusively here. <B>{The prayers}</B> <b><i>(\tais<br>
 proseuchais\)</i></b>. Services where they prayed as in <!-#-->1:14, in the<br>
 temple <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 3:1)</i></b>, in their homes <b><i>(<!-#-->4:23)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:43 <B>{Came}</B> <b><i>(\egineto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, kept on coming. <B>{Were<br>
 done}</B> <b><i>(\egineto\)</i></b>. Same tense. Awe kept on coming on all and<br>
 signs and wonders kept on coming through the apostles. The two<br>
 things went on \pari passu\, the more wonders the more fear.<br>
 <br>
 2:44 <B>{Were together}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san epi to auto\)</i></b>. Some MSS. \&#275;san kai\<br>
 <b><i>(were and)</i></b>. But they were together in the same place as in <!-#-->2:1.<br>
 <B>{And had}</B> <b><i>(\kai eichon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, kept on having, a<br>
 habit in the present emergency. <B>{Common}</B> <b><i>(\koina\)</i></b>. It was not<br>
 actual communism, but they held all their property ready for use<br>
 for the common good as it was needed <b><i>(<!-#-->4:32)</i></b>. This situation<br>
 appears nowhere else except in Jerusalem and was evidently due to<br>
 special conditions there which did not survive permanently. Later<br>
 Paul will take a special collection for the poor saints in<br>
 Jerusalem.<br>
 <br>
 2:45 <B>{Sold}</B> <b><i>(\epipraskon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, a habit or custom<br>
 from time to time. Old and common verb, \piprask&#333;\. <B>{Parted}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\diemerizon\)</i></b>. Imperfect again of \diameriz&#333;\, old verb for<br>
 dividing or distributing between <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> people. <B>{According as<br>
 any man had need}</B> <b><i>(\kathoti an tis chreian eichen\)</i></b>. Regular<br>
 Greek idiom for comparative clause with \an\ and imperfect<br>
 indicative corresponding precisely with the three preceding<br>
 imperfects <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 967)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:46 <B>{With one accord in the temple}</B> <b><i>(\homothumadon en t&#333;i<br>
 hier&#333;i\)</i></b>. See on &#175;1:14 for \homothumadon\. They were still<br>
 worshipping in the temple for no breach had yet come between<br>
 Christians and Jews. Daily they were here and daily breaking<br>
 bread at home <b><i>(\kat' oikon\)</i></b> which looks like the regular meal.<br>
 <B>{They did take their food}</B> <b><i>(\metelambanon troph&#275;s\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 tense again and clearly referring to the regular meals at home.<br>
 Does it refer also to the possible \agapai\ or to the Lord's<br>
 Supper afterwards as they had common meals "from house to house"<br>
 <b><i>(\kat' oikon\)</i></b>? We know there were local churches in the homes<br>
 where they had "worship rooms," the church in the house. At any<br>
 rate it was "with singleness" <b><i>(\aphelot&#275;ti\)</i></b> of heart. The word<br>
 occurs only here in the N.T., though a late _Koin&#275;_ word<br>
 <b><i>(papyri)</i></b>. It comes from \aphel&#275;s\, free from rock <b><i>(\phelleus\ is<br>
 stony ground)</i></b>, smooth. The old form was \apheleia\.<br>
 <br>
 2:47 <B>{Having favor}</B> <b><i>(\echontes charin\)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Lu 2:52 of the Boy<br>
 Jesus. <B>{Added}</B> <b><i>(\prosetithei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, kept on adding.<br>
 If the Lord only always "added" those who join our churches. Note<br>
 verse <!-#-->41 where same verb is used of the 3,000. <B>{To them}</B> <b><i>(\epi<br>
 to auto\)</i></b>. Literally, "together." Why not leave it so? "To the<br>
 church" <b><i>(\t&#275;i ekkl&#275;si&#257;i\)</i></b> is not genuine. Codex Bezae has "in the<br>
 church." <B>{Those that were being saved}</B> <b><i>(\tous s&#333;zomenous\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present passive participle. Probably for repetition like the<br>
 imperfect \prosetithei\. Better translate it "those saved from<br>
 time to time." It was a continuous revival, day by day. \S&#333;z&#333;\<br>
 like \s&#333;t&#275;ria\ is used for "save" in three senses <b><i>(beginning,<br>
 process, conclusion)</i></b>, but here repetition is clearly the point of<br>
 the present tense.<br>
