<p>5:1 <B>{Being therefore justified by faith}</B> <b><i>(\dikai&#333;thentes oun ek<br>
 piste&#333;s\)</i></b>. First aorist passive participle of \dikaio&#333;\, to set<br>
 right and expressing antecedent action to the verb \ech&#333;men\. The<br>
 \oun\ refers to the preceding conclusive argument <b><i>(chapters 1 to<br>
 4)</i></b> that this is done by faith. <B>{Let us have peace with God}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eir&#275;n&#275;n ech&#333;men pros ton theon\)</i></b>. This is the correct text<br>
 beyond a doubt, the present active subjunctive, not \echomen\<br>
 <b><i>(present active indicative)</i></b> of the Textus Receptus which even the<br>
 American Standard Bible accepts. It is curious how perverse many<br>
 real scholars have been on this word and phrase here. Godet, for<br>
 instance. Vincent says that "it is difficult if not impossible to<br>
 explain it." One has only to observe the force of the _tense_ to<br>
 see Paul's meaning clearly. The mode is the volitive subjunctive<br>
 and the present tense expresses linear action and so does not<br>
 mean "make peace" as the ingressive aorist subjunctive \eir&#275;n&#275;n<br>
 sch&#333;men\ would mean. A good example of \sch&#333;men\ occurs in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 21:38 <b><i>(\sch&#333;men t&#275;n kl&#275;ronomian autou\)</i></b> where it means: "Let us<br>
 get hold of his inheritance." Here \eir&#275;n&#275;n ech&#333;men\ can only<br>
 mean: "Let us enjoy peace with God" or "Let us retain peace with<br>
 God." We have in <!-#-->Ac 9:31 \eichen eir&#275;n&#275;n\ <b><i>(imperfect and so<br>
 linear)</i></b>, the church "enjoyed peace," not "made peace." The<br>
 preceding justification <b><i>(\dikai&#333;thentes\)</i></b> "made peace with God."<br>
 Observe \pros\ <b><i>(face to face)</i></b> with \ton theon\ and \dia\<br>
 <b><i>(intermediate agent)</i></b> with \tou kuriou\.<br>
 <br>
 5:2 <B>{We have had}</B> <b><i>(\esch&#275;kamen\)</i></b>. Perfect active indicative of<br>
 \ech&#333;\ <b><i>(same verb as \ech&#333;men\)</i></b>, still have it. <B>{Our access}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ten prosag&#333;g&#275;n\)</i></b>. Old word from \prosag&#333;\, to bring to, to<br>
 introduce. Hence "introduction," "approach." Elsewhere in N.T.<br>
 only <!-#-->Eph 2:18; 3:12. <B>{Wherein we stand}</B> <b><i>(\en h&#275;i hest&#275;kamen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Perfect active <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b> indicative of \hist&#275;mi\. Grace is<br>
 here present as a field into which we have been introduced and<br>
 where we stand and we should enjoy all the privileges of this<br>
 grace about us. <B>{Let us rejoice}</B> <b><i>(\kauch&#333;metha\)</i></b>. "Let us exult."<br>
 Present middle subjunctive <b><i>(volitive)</i></b> because \ech&#333;men\ is<br>
 accepted as correct. The exhortation is that we keep on enjoying<br>
 peace with God and keep on exulting in hope of the glory of God.<br>
 <br>
 5:3 <B>{But let us also rejoice in our tribulations}</B> <b><i>(\alla kai<br>
 kauch&#333;metha en tais thlipsesin\)</i></b>. Present middle subjunctive of<br>
 same verb as in verse <!-#-->2. \Kauch&#333;mai\ is more than "rejoice,"<br>
 rather "glory," "exult." These three volitive subjunctives<br>
 <b><i>(\ech&#333;men, kauch&#333;metha\, twice)</i></b> hold up the high ideal for the<br>
 Christian after, and because of, his being set right with God. It<br>
 is one thing to submit to or endure tribulations without<br>
 complaint, but it is another to find ground of glorying in the<br>
 midst of them as Paul exhorts here.<br>
 <br>
 5:4 <B>{Knowing}</B> <b><i>(\eidotes\)</i></b>. Second perfect participle of \eidon\<br>
 <b><i>(\oida\)</i></b>, giving the reason for the previous exhortation to glory<br>
 in tribulations. He gives a linked chain, one linking to the<br>
 other <b><i>(tribulation \thlipsis\, patience \hupomon&#275;\, experience<br>
 \dokim&#275;\, hope \elpis\)</i></b> running into verse <!-#-->5. On \dokim&#275;\, see<br>
 <!-#-->2Co 2:9.<br>
 <br>
 5:5 <B>{Hath been shed abroad}</B> <b><i>(\ekkechutai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 indicative of \ekche&#333;\, to pour out. "Has been poured out" in our<br>
 hearts.<br>
 <br>
 5:6 <B>{For}</B> <b><i>(\eti gar\)</i></b>. So most documents, but B reads \ei ge\<br>
 which Westcott and Hort use in place of \gar\. <B>{While we were yet<br>
 weak}</B> <b><i>(\ont&#333;n h&#275;m&#333;n asthen&#333;n eti\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute. The second<br>
 \eti\ <b><i>(yet)</i></b> here probably gave rise to the confusion of text over<br>
 \eti gar\ above. <B>{In due season}</B> <b><i>(\kata kairon\)</i></b>. Christ came<br>
 into the world at the proper time, the fulness of the time <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga<br>
 4:4; Eph 1:10; Tit 1:3)</i></b>. <B>{I or the ungodly}</B> <b><i>(\huper aseb&#333;n\)</i></b>. In<br>
 behalf, instead of. See about \huper\ on <!-#-->Ga 3:13 and also verse<br>
 <!-#-->7 here.<br>
 <br>
 5:7 <B>{Scarcely}</B> <b><i>(\molis\)</i></b>. Common adverb from \molos\, toil. See<br>
 on <!-#-->Ac 14:18. As between \dikaios\, righteous, and \agathos\,<br>
 good, Lightfoot notes "all the difference in the world" which he<br>
 shows by quotations from Plato and Christian writers, a<br>
 difference of sympathy mainly, the \dikaios\ man being<br>
 "absolutely without sympathy" while the \agathos\ man "is<br>
 beneficent and kind." <B>{Would even dare}</B> <b><i>(\kai tolm&#257;i\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 active indicative of \tolma&#333;\, to have courage. "Even dares to."<br>
 Even so in the case of the kindly sympathetic man courage is<br>
 called for to make the supreme sacrifice. <B>{Perhaps}</B> <b><i>(\tacha\)</i></b>.<br>
 Common adverb <b><i>(perhaps instrumental case)</i></b> from \tachus\ <b><i>(swift)</i></b>.<br>
 Only here in N.T.<br>
 <br>
 5:8 <B>{His own love}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n heautou agap&#275;n\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Joh 3:16 as the<br>
 best comment here. <B>{While we were yet sinners}</B> <b><i>(\eti hamart&#333;l&#333;n<br>
 ont&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again. Not because we were Jews or<br>
 Greeks, rich or poor, righteous or good, but plain sinners. Cf.<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 18:13, the plea of the publican, "\moi t&#333;i hamart&#333;l&#333;i\."<br>
 <br>
 5:9 <B>{Much more then}</B> <b><i>(\poll&#333;i oun mallon\)</i></b>. Argument from the<br>
 greater to the less. The great thing is the justification in<br>
 Christ's blood. The final salvation <b><i>(\s&#333;th&#275;sometha\, future<br>
 passive indicative)</i></b> is less of a mystery.<br>
 <br>
 5:10 <B>{We were reconciled to God}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;llag&#275;men t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist passive indicative of \katallass&#333;\ for which great<br>
 Pauline word see on &#175;2Co 5:18f. The condition is the first<br>
 class. Paul does not conceive it as his or our task to reconcile<br>
 God to us. God has attended to that himself <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 3:25f.)</i></b>. We<br>
 become reconciled to God by means of the death of God's Son.<br>
 "Much more" again we shall be saved "by his life" <b><i>(\en t&#275;i z&#333;&#275;i<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. "In his life," for he does live, "ever living to<br>
 intercede for them" <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 7:25)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:11 <B>{But also glorying in God}</B> <b><i>(\alla kai kauch&#333;menoi en t&#333;i<br>
 the&#333;i\)</i></b>. Basis of all the exultation above <b><i>(verses <!-#-->1-5)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Through whom we have now received the reconciliation}</B> <b><i>(\di hou<br>
 nun t&#275;n katallag&#275;n elabomen\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative of<br>
 \lamban&#333;\, looked at as a past realization, "now" <b><i>(\nun\)</i></b> in<br>
 contrast with the future consummation and a sure pledge and<br>
 guarantee of it.<br>
 <br>
 5:12 <B>{Therefore}</B> <b><i>(\dia touto\)</i></b>. "For this reason." What reason?<br>
 Probably the argument made in verses <!-#-->1-11, assuming our<br>
 justification and urging exultant joy in Christ because of the<br>
 present reconciliation by Christ's death and the certainty of<br>
 future final salvation by his life. <B>{As through one man}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;sper<br>
 di' henos anthr&#333;pou\)</i></b>. Paul begins a comparison between the<br>
 effects of Adam's sin and the effects of the redemptive work of<br>
 Christ, but he does not give the second member of the comparison.<br>
 Instead of that he discusses some problems about sin and death<br>
 and starts over again in verse <!-#-->15. The general point is plain<br>
 that the effects of Adam's sin are transmitted to his<br>
 descendants, though he does not say how it was done whether by<br>
 the natural or the federal headship of Adam. It is important to<br>
 note that Paul does not say that the whole race receives the full<br>
 benefit of Christ's atoning death, but only those who do. Christ<br>
 is the head of all believers as Adam is the head of the race. In<br>
 this sense Adam "is a figure of him that was to come." <B>{Sin<br>
 entered into the world}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; hamartia eis ton kosmon eis&#275;lthen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Personification of sin and represented as coming from the outside<br>
 into the world of humanity. Paul does not discuss the origin of<br>
 evil beyond this fact. There are some today who deny the fact of<br>
 sin at all and who call it merely "an error of mortal mind" <b><i>(a<br>
 notion)</i></b> while others regard it as merely an animal inheritance<br>
 devoid of ethical quality. <B>{And so death passed unto all men}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai hout&#333;s eis pantas anthr&#333;pous di&#275;lthen\)</i></b>. Note use of<br>
 \dierchomai\ rather than \eiserchomai\, just before, second<br>
 aorist active indicative in both instances. By "death" in <!-#-->Ge<br>
 2:17; 3:19 physical death is meant, but in verses <!-#-->17,21<br>
 eternal death is Paul's idea and that lurks constantly behind<br>
 physical death with Paul. <B>{For that all sinned}</B> <b><i>(\eph' h&#333;i pantes<br>
 h&#275;marton\)</i></b>. Constative <b><i>(summary)</i></b> aorist active indicative of<br>
 \hamartan&#333;\, gathering up in this one tense the history of the<br>
 race <b><i>(committed sin)</i></b>. The transmission from Adam became facts of<br>
 experience. In the old Greek \eph' h&#333;i\ usually meant "on<br>
 condition that," but "because" in N.T. <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 963)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:13 <B>{Until the law}</B> <b><i>(\achri nomou\)</i></b>. Until the Mosaic law. Sin<br>
 was there before the Mosaic law, for the Jews were like Gentiles<br>
 who had the law of reason and conscience <b><i>(<!-#-->2:12-16)</i></b>, but the<br>
 coming of the law increased their responsibility and their guilt<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2:9)</i></b>. <B>{Sin is not imputed}</B> <b><i>(\hamartia de ouk ellogeitai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present passive indicative of late verb \elloga&#333;\ <b><i>(\-e&#333;\)</i></b> from<br>
 \en\ and \logos\, to put down in the ledger to one's account,<br>
 examples in inscription and papyri. <B>{When there is no law}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;<br>
 ontos nomou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute, no law of any kind, he means.<br>
 There was law _before_ the Mosaic law. But what about infants and<br>
 idiots in case of death? Do they have responsibility? Surely not.<br>
 The sinful nature which they inherit is met by Christ's atoning<br>
 death and grace. No longer do men speak of "elect infants."<br>
 <br>
 5:14 <B>{Even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of<br>
 Adam's transgression}</B> <b><i>(\kai epi tous m&#275; hamart&#275;santas epi t&#333;i<br>
 homoi&#333;mati t&#275;s parabase&#333;s Adam\)</i></b>. Adam violated an express<br>
 command of God and Moses gave the law of God clearly. And yet sin<br>
 and death followed all from Adam on till Moses, showing clearly<br>
 that the sin of Adam brought terrible consequences upon the race.<br>
 Death has come upon infants and idiots also as a result of sin,<br>
 but one understands Paul to mean that they are not held<br>
 responsible by the law of conscience. <B>{A figure}</B> <b><i>(\tupos\)</i></b>. See<br>
 on &#175;Ac 7:43; 1Th 1:7; 2Th 3:9; 1Co 10:6 for this word. Adam is a<br>
 type of Christ in holding a relation to those affected by the<br>
 headship in each case, but the parallel is not precise as Paul<br>
 shows.<br>
 <br>
 5:15 <B>{But not as the trespass}</B> <b><i>(\all' ouch h&#333;s\)</i></b>. It is more<br>
 contrast than parallel: "the trespass" <b><i>(\to parapt&#333;ma\, the slip,<br>
 fall to one side)</i></b> over against the free gift <b><i>(\to charisma\, of<br>
 grace \charis\)</i></b>. <B>{Much more}</B> <b><i>(\poll&#333;i mallon\)</i></b>. Another _a<br>
 fortiori_ argument. Why so? As a God of love he delights <B>{much<br>
 more}</B> in showing mercy and pardon than in giving just punishment<br>
 <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. The gift surpasses the sin. It is not necessary to<br>
 Paul's argument to make "the many" in each case correspond, one<br>
 relates to Adam, the other to Christ.<br>
 <br>
 5:16 <B>{Through one that sinned}</B> <b><i>(\di' henos hamart&#275;santos\)</i></b>.<br>
 "Through one having sinned." That is Adam. Another contrast,<br>
 difference in source <b><i>(\ek\)</i></b>. <B>{Of one}</B> <b><i>(\ex henos\)</i></b>. Supply<br>
 \parapt&#333;matos\, Adam's one transgression. <B>{Of many trespasses}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ek poll&#333;n parapt&#333;mat&#333;n\)</i></b>. The gift by Christ grew out of<br>
 manifold sins by Adam's progeny. <B>{Justification}</B> <b><i>(\dikai&#333;ma\)</i></b>.<br>
 Act of righteousness, result, ordinance <b><i>(<!-#-->1:32; 2:26; 8:4)</i></b>,<br>
 righteous deed <b><i>(<!-#-->5:18)</i></b>, verdict as here <b><i>(acquittal)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:17 <B>{Much more}</B> <b><i>(\poll&#333;i mallon\)</i></b>. Argument _a fortiori_ again.<br>
 Condition of first class assumed to be true. Note balanced words<br>
 in the contrast <b><i>(transgression \parapt&#333;mati\, grace \charitos\;<br>
 death \thanatos\, life \z&#333;&#275;i\; the one or <B>{Adam}</B> \tou henos\, the<br>
 one <B>{Jesus Christ}</B>; reign \basileu&#333;\ in both)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:18 <B>{So then}</B> <b><i>(\ara oun\)</i></b>. Conclusion of the argument. Cf.<br>
 <!-#-->7:3,25; 8:12, etc. Paul resumes the parallel between Adam and<br>
 Christ begun in verse <!-#-->12 and interrupted by explanation<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->13f.)</i></b> and contrast <b><i>(<!-#-->15-17)</i></b>. <B>{Through one trespass}</B> <b><i>(\di'<br>
 henos parapt&#333;matos\)</i></b>. That of Adam. <B>{Through one act of<br>
 righteousness}</B> <b><i>(\di' henos dikai&#333;matos\)</i></b>. That of Christ. The<br>
 first "unto all men" <b><i>(\eis pantas anthr&#333;pous\)</i></b> as in verse <!-#-->12,<br>
 the second as in verse <!-#-->17 "they that receive, etc."<br>
 <br>
 5:19 Here again we have "the one" <b><i>(\tou henos\)</i></b> with both Adam<br>
 and Christ, but "disobedience" <b><i>(\parako&#275;s\, for which see <!-#-->2Co<br>
 10:6)</i></b> contrasted with "obedience" <b><i>(\hupako&#275;s\)</i></b>, the same verb<br>
 \kathist&#275;mi\, old verb, to set down, to render, to constitute<br>
 <b><i>(\katestath&#275;san\, first aorist passive indicative,<br>
 \katastath&#275;sontai\, future passive)</i></b>, and "the many" <b><i>(\hoi<br>
 polloi\)</i></b> in both cases <b><i>(but with different meaning as with "all<br>
 men" above)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:20 <B>{Came in beside}</B> <b><i>(\pareis&#275;lthen\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative of double compound \pareiserchomai\, late verb, in<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ga 2:4 which see. See also \eis&#275;lthen\ in<br>
 verse <!-#-->12. The Mosaic law came into this state of things, in<br>
 between Adam and Christ. <B>{That the trespass might abound}</B> <b><i>(\hina<br>
 pleonas&#275;i to parapt&#333;ma\)</i></b>. It is usual to explain \hina\ here as<br>
 final, as God's ultimate purpose. So Denney who refers to <!-#-->Ga<br>
 3:19ff.; Ro 7:7f. But Chrysostom explains \hina\ here as<br>
 \ekbasis\ <b><i>(result)</i></b>. This is a proper use of \hina\ in the _Koin&#275;_<br>
 as we have seen. If we take it so here, the meaning is "so that<br>
 the trespass abounded" <b><i>(aorist active subjunctive of \pleonas&#333;\,<br>
 late verb, see on &#175;2Th 1:3; 2Co 8:15)</i></b>. This was the actual<br>
 effect of the Mosaic law for the Jews, the necessary result of<br>
 all prohibitions. <B>{Did abound more exceedingly}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hupereperisseusen\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of<br>
 \huperperisseu&#333;\. Late verb, in N.T. only here and <!-#-->2Co 7:4<br>
 which see. A strong word. If \pleonaz&#333;\ is comparative <b><i>(\pleon\)</i></b><br>
 \perisseu&#333;\ is superlative <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b> and then \huperperisseu&#333;\<br>
 goes the superlative one better. See \huperpleonaz&#333;\ in <!-#-->1Ti<br>
 1:14. The flood of grace surpassed the flood of sin, great as<br>
 that was <b><i>(and is)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:21 <B>{That--even so grace might reign}</B> <b><i>(\hina--houtos kai h&#275;<br>
 charis basileus&#275;i\)</i></b>. Final \hina\ here, the purpose of God and<br>
 the goal for us through Christ. Lightfoot notes the force of the<br>
 aorist indicative <b><i>(\ebasileusen\, established its throne)</i></b> and the<br>
 aorist subjunctive <b><i>(\basileus&#275;i\, might establish its throne)</i></b>,<br>
 the ingressive aorist both times. "This full rhetorical close has<br>
 almost the value of a doxology" <b><i>(Denney)</i></b>.<br>
