<p>21:1 <B>{Were parted from them}</B> <b><i>(\apospasthentas ap' aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive participle of \apospa&#333;\ same verb as in <!-#-->20:30; Lu<br>
 22:41. <B>{Had set sail}</B> <b><i>(\anachth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist passive of<br>
 \anag&#333;\, the usual verb to put out <b><i>(up)</i></b> to sea as in verse <!-#-->2<br>
 <b><i>(\an&#275;chth&#275;men\)</i></b>. <B>{We came with a straight course}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\euthudrom&#275;santes &#275;lthomen\)</i></b>. The same verb <b><i>(aorist active<br>
 participle of \euthudrome&#333;\)</i></b> used by Luke in <!-#-->16:11 of the<br>
 voyage from Troas to Samothrace and Neapolis, which see. <B>{Unto<br>
 Cos}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n Ko\)</i></b>. Standing today, about forty nautical miles<br>
 south from Miletus, island famous as the birthplace of<br>
 Hippocrates and Apelles with a great medical school. Great<br>
 trading place with many Jews. <B>{The next day}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i hex&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Locative case with \h&#275;mer&#257;i\ <b><i>(day)</i></b> understood. The adverb \hex&#275;s\<br>
 is from \ech&#333;\ <b><i>(future \hex&#333;\)</i></b> and means successively or in<br>
 order. This is another one of Luke's ways of saying "on the next<br>
 day" <b><i>(cf. three others in <!-#-->20:15)</i></b>. <B>{Unto Rhodes}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n<br>
 Rhodon\)</i></b>. Called the island of roses. The sun shone most days and<br>
 made roses luxuriant. The great colossus which represented the<br>
 sun, one of the seven wonders of the world, was prostrate at this<br>
 time. The island was at the entrance to the Aegean Sea and had a<br>
 great university, especially for rhetoric and oratory. There was<br>
 great commerce also. <B>{Unto Patara}</B> <b><i>(\eis Patara\)</i></b>. A seaport on<br>
 the Lycian coast on the left bank of the Xanthus. It once had an<br>
 oracle of Apollo which rivalled that at Delphi. This was the<br>
 course taken by hundreds of ships every season.<br>
 <br>
 21:2 <B>{Having found a ship}</B> <b><i>(\heurontes ploion\)</i></b>. Paul had used a<br>
 small coasting vessel <b><i>(probably hired)</i></b> that anchored each night<br>
 at Cos, Rhodes, Patara. He was still some four hundred miles from<br>
 Jerusalem. But at Patara Paul caught a large vessel <b><i>(a<br>
 merchantman)</i></b> that could sail across the open sea. <B>{Crossing over<br>
 unto Phoenicia}</B> <b><i>(\diaper&#333;n eis Phoinik&#275;n\)</i></b>. Neuter singular<br>
 accusative <b><i>(agreeing with \ploion\)</i></b> present active participle of<br>
 \diapera&#333;\, old verb to go between <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> and so across to Tyre.<br>
 <B>{We went aboard}</B> <b><i>(\epibantes\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle<br>
 of \epibain&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 21:3 <B>{When we had come in sight of Cyprus}</B> <b><i>(\anaphanantes t&#275;n<br>
 Kupron\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle of \anaphain&#333;\ <b><i>(Doric<br>
 form \-phan&#257;ntes\ rather than the Attic \-ph&#275;nantes\)</i></b>, old verb<br>
 to make appear, bring to light, to manifest. Having made Cyprus<br>
 visible or rise up out of the sea. Nautical terms. In the N.T.<br>
 only here and <!-#-->Lu 19:11 which see. <B>{On the left hand}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eu&#333;numon\)</i></b>. Compound feminine adjective like masculine. They<br>
 sailed south of Cyprus. <B>{We sailed}</B> <b><i>(\epleomen\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active of common verb \ple&#333;\, kept on sailing till we came to<br>
 Syria. <B>{Landed at Tyre}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;lthomen eis Turon\)</i></b>. Came down to<br>
 Tyre. Then a free city of Syria in honour of its former greatness<br>
 <b><i>(cf. the long siege by Alexander the Great)</i></b>. <B>{There}</B> <b><i>(\ekeise\)</i></b>.<br>
 Thither, literally. Only one other instance in N.T., <!-#-->22:5 which<br>
 may be pertinent = \ekei\ <b><i>(there)</i></b>. <B>{Was to unlade}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n<br>
 apophortizomenon\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect middle of<br>
 \apophortiz&#333;\, late verb from \apo\ and \phortos\, load, but here<br>
 only in the N.T. Literally, "For thither the boat was unloading<br>
 her cargo," a sort of "customary" or "progressive" imperfect<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 884)</i></b>. <B>{Burden}</B> <b><i>(\gomon\)</i></b>. Cargo, old<br>
 word, from \gem&#333;\, to be full. Only here and <!-#-->Re 18:11f. in N.T.<br>
 Probably a grain or fruit ship. It took seven days here to unload<br>
 and reload.<br>
 <br>
 21:4 <B>{Having found}</B> <b><i>(\aneurontes\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \aneurisk&#333;\, to seek for, to find by searching<br>
 <b><i>(\ana\)</i></b>. There was a church here, but it was a large city and the<br>
 number of members may not have been large. Probably some of those<br>
 that fled from Jerusalem who came to Phoenicia <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:19)</i></b><br>
 started the work here. Paul went also through Phoenicia on the<br>
 way to the Jerusalem Conference <b><i>(<!-#-->15:3)</i></b>. As at Troas and<br>
 Miletus, so here Paul's indefatigible energy shows itself with<br>
 characteristic zeal. <B>{Through the Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\dia tou pneumatos\)</i></b>.<br>
 The Holy Spirit undoubtedly who had already told Paul that bonds<br>
 and afflictions awaited him in Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->20:23)</i></b>. <B>{That he<br>
 should not set foot in Jerusalem}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; epibainein eis<br>
 Ierosoluma\)</i></b>. Indirect command with \m&#275;\ and the present active<br>
 infinitive, not to keep on going to Jerusalem <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 1046)</i></b>. In spite of this warning Paul felt it his<br>
 duty as before <b><i>(<!-#-->20:22)</i></b> to go on. Evidently Paul interpreted the<br>
 action of the Holy Spirit as information and warning although the<br>
 disciples at Tyre gave it the form of a prohibition. Duty called<br>
 louder than warning to Paul even if both were the calls of God.<br>
 <br>
 21:5 <B>{That we had accomplished the days}</B> <b><i>(\exartisai h&#275;m&#257;s tas<br>
 h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. First aorist active infinitive of \exartiz&#333;\, to<br>
 furnish perfectly, rare in ancient writers, but fairly frequent<br>
 in the papyri. Only twice in the N.T., here and <!-#-->2Ti 3:17.<br>
 Finish the exact number of days <b><i>(seven)</i></b> of verse <!-#-->4. The<br>
 accusative of general reference \h&#275;m&#257;s\ is the usual construction<br>
 and the infinitive clause is the subject of \egeneto\. We<br>
 departed and went on our journey <b><i>(\exelthontes eporeuometha\)</i></b>.<br>
 Sharp distinction between the first aorist active participle<br>
 \exelthontes\ <b><i>(from \exerchomai\, to go out)</i></b> and the imperfect<br>
 middle \eporeuometha\ from \poreu&#333;\ <b><i>(we were going on)</i></b>. <B>{And they<br>
 all, with wives and children, brought us on our way}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\propempont&#333;n h&#275;m&#257;s pant&#333;n sun gunaixi kai teknois\)</i></b>. No "and"<br>
 in the Greek, simply genitive absolute, "They all with wives and<br>
 children accompanying us," just as at Miletus <b><i>(<!-#-->20:28)</i></b>, same<br>
 verb \propemp&#333;\ which see. The first mention of children in<br>
 connection with the apostolic churches <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. Vivid picture<br>
 here as at Miletus, evident touch of an eyewitness. <B>{Till we were<br>
 out of the city}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s ex&#333; t&#275;s pole&#333;s\)</i></b>. Note both adverbial<br>
 prepositions <b><i>(\he&#333;s ex&#333;\)</i></b> clear outside of the city.<br>
 <br>
 21:6 <B>{Beach}</B> <b><i>(\aigialon\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->Mt 13:2 which see. This scene<br>
 is in public as at Miletus, but they did not care. <B>{Bade each<br>
 other farewell}</B> <b><i>(\apespasametha all&#275;lous\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 of \apaspazomai\. Rare compound, here alone in the N.T. Tender<br>
 scene, but "no bonds of long comradeship, none of the clinging<br>
 love" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b> seen at Miletus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:37f.)</i></b>. <B>{Home again}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eis ta idia\)</i></b>. To their own places as of the Beloved Disciple<br>
 in <!-#-->Joh 19:27 and of Jesus in <!-#-->Joh 1:11. This idiom in the<br>
 papyri also.<br>
 <br>
 21:7 <B>{Had finished}</B> <b><i>(\dianusantes\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 participle of \dianu&#333;\, old verb to accomplish <b><i>(\anu&#333;\)</i></b><br>
 thoroughly <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b>, only here in the N.T. <B>{From Tyre}</B> <b><i>(\apo<br>
 Turou\)</i></b>. Page takes <b><i>(Hackett also)</i></b> with \kat&#275;nt&#275;samen\ <b><i>(we<br>
 arrived)</i></b> rather than with "\ton ploun\" <b><i>(the voyage)</i></b> and with<br>
 good reason: "And we, having <b><i>(thereby)</i></b> finished the voyage,<br>
 arrived from Tyre at Ptolemais." Ptolemais is the modern Acre,<br>
 called Accho in <!-#-->Jud 1:31. The harbour is the best on the coast<br>
 of Palestine and is surrounded by mountains. It is about thirty<br>
 miles south of Tyre. It was never taken by Israel and was<br>
 considered a Philistine town and the Greeks counted it a<br>
 Phoenician city. It was the key to the road down the coast<br>
 between Syria and Egypt and had successively the rule of the<br>
 Ptolemies, Syrians, Romans. <B>{Saluted}</B> <b><i>(\aspasamenoi\)</i></b>. Here<br>
 greeting as in <!-#-->21:19 rather than farewell as in <!-#-->20:1. The<br>
 stay was short, one day <b><i>(\h&#275;meran mian\, accusative)</i></b>, but "the<br>
 brethren" Paul and his party found easily. Possibly the scattered<br>
 brethren <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:19)</i></b> founded the church here or Philip may have<br>
 done it.<br>
 <br>
 21:8 <B>{On the morrow}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i epaurion\)</i></b>. Another and the more<br>
 common way of expressing this idea of "next day" besides the<br>
 three in <!-#-->20:15 and the one in <!-#-->21:1. <B>{Unto Caesarea}</B> <b><i>(\eis<br>
 Kaisarian\)</i></b>. Apparently by land as the voyage <b><i>(\ploun\)</i></b> ended at<br>
 Ptolemais <b><i>(verse <!-#-->7)</i></b>. Caesarea is the political capital of Judea<br>
 under the Romans where the procurators lived and a city of<br>
 importance, built by Herod the Great and named in honour of<br>
 Augustus. It had a magnificent harbour built Most of the<br>
 inhabitants were Greeks. This is the third time that we have seen<br>
 Paul in Caesarea, on his journey from Jerusalem to Tarsus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 9:30)</i></b>, on his return from Antioch at the close of the second<br>
 mission tour <b><i>(<!-#-->18:22)</i></b> and now. The best MSS. omit \hoi peri<br>
 Paulou\ <b><i>(we that were of Paul's company)</i></b> a phrase like that in<br>
 <!-#-->13:13. <B>{Into the house of Philip the evangelist}</B> <b><i>(\eis ton<br>
 oikon Philippou tou euaggelistou\)</i></b>. Second in the list of the<br>
 seven <b><i>(<!-#-->6:5)</i></b> after Stephen and that fact mentioned here. By this<br>
 title he is distinguished from "Philip the apostle," one of the<br>
 twelve. His evangelistic work followed the death of Stephen <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 8)</i></b> in Samaria, Philistia, with his home in Caesarea. The word<br>
 "evangelizing" <b><i>(\eu&#275;ggelizeto\)</i></b> was used of him in <!-#-->8:40. The<br>
 earliest of the three N.T. examples of the word "evangelist" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 21:8; Eph 4:11; 2Ti 4:5)</i></b>. Apparently a word used to describe one<br>
 who told the gospel story as Philip did and may have been used of<br>
 him first of all as John was termed "the baptizer" <b><i>(\ho<br>
 baptiz&#333;n\, <!-#-->Mr 1:4)</i></b>, then "the Baptist" <b><i>(\ho baptist&#275;s\, <!-#-->Mt<br>
 3:1)</i></b>. It is found on an inscription in one of the Greek islands<br>
 of uncertain date and was used in ecclesiastical writers of later<br>
 times on the Four Gospels as we do. As used here the meaning is a<br>
 travelling missionary who "gospelized" communities. This is<br>
 probably Paul's idea in <!-#-->2Ti 4:5. In <!-#-->Eph 4:11 the word seems<br>
 to describe a special class of ministers just as we have them<br>
 today. Men have different gifts and Philip had this of<br>
 evangelizing as Paul was doing who is the chief evangelist. The<br>
 ideal minister today combines the gifts of evangelist, herald,<br>
 teacher, shepherd. "<B>{We abode with him}</B>" <b><i>(\emeinamen par'<br>
 aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Constative aorist active indicative. \Par aut&#333;i\ <b><i>(by his<br>
 side)</i></b> is a neat idiom for "at his house." What a joyful time Paul<br>
 had in conversation with Philip. He could learn from him much of<br>
 value about the early days of the gospel in Jerusalem. And Luke<br>
 could, and probably did, take notes from Philip and his daughters<br>
 about the beginnings of Christian history. It is generally<br>
 supposed that the "we" sections of Acts represent a travel<br>
 document by Luke <b><i>(notes made by him as he journeyed from Troas to<br>
 Rome)</i></b>. Those who deny the Lukan authorship of the whole book<br>
 usually admit this. So we may suppose that Luke is already<br>
 gathering data for future use. If so, these were precious days<br>
 for him.<br>
 <br>
 21:9 <B>{Virgins which did prophesy}</B> <b><i>(\parthenoi proph&#275;teusai\)</i></b>. Not<br>
 necessarily an "order" of virgins, but Philip had the honour of<br>
 having in his home four virgin daughters with the gift of<br>
 prophecy which was not necessarily predicting events, though that<br>
 was done as by Agabus here. It was more than ordinary preaching<br>
 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->19:6)</i></b> and was put by Paul above the other gifts like<br>
 tongues <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 14:1-33)</i></b>. The prophecy of Joel <b><i>(<!-#-->2:28f.)</i></b> about<br>
 their sons and daughters prophesying is quoted by Peter and<br>
 applied to the events on the day of Pentecost <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 2:17)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 in <!-#-->1Co 11:5 gives directions about praying and prophesying by<br>
 the women <b><i>(apparently in public worship)</i></b> with the head uncovered<br>
 and sharply requires the head covering, though not forbidding the<br>
 praying and prophesying. With this must be compared his demand<br>
 for silence by the women in <!-#-->1Co 14:34-40; 1Ti 2:8-15 which it<br>
 is not easy to reconcile. One wonders if there was not something<br>
 known to Paul about special conditions in Corinth and Ephesus<br>
 that he has not told. There was also Anna the prophetess in the<br>
 temple <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:36)</i></b> besides the inspired hymns of Elizabeth <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 1:42-45)</i></b> and of Mary <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:46-55)</i></b>. At any rate there was no<br>
 order of women prophets or official ministers. There were Old<br>
 Testament prophetesses like Miriam, Deborah, Huldah. Today in our<br>
 Sunday schools the women do most of the actual teaching. The<br>
 whole problem is difficult and calls for restraint and reverence.<br>
 One thing is certain and that is that Luke appreciated the<br>
 services of women for Christ as is shown often in his writings<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:1-3, for instance)</i></b> before this incident.<br>
 <br>
 21:10 <B>{As we tarried}</B> <b><i>(\epimenont&#333;n h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute.<br>
 Note \epi\ <b><i>(additional)</i></b> with \men&#333;\ as in <!-#-->12:16. <B>{Many days}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\h&#275;meras pleious\)</i></b>. More days <b><i>(than we expected)</i></b>, accusative of<br>
 time. <B>{A certain prophet named Agabus}</B> <b><i>(\proph&#275;t&#275;s onomati<br>
 Agabos\)</i></b>. A prophet like the daughters of Philip, mentioned<br>
 already in connection with the famine predicted by him <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 11:28)</i></b>, but apparently not a man of prominence like Barnabas,<br>
 and so no allusion to that former prophecy.<br>
 <br>
 21:11 <B>{Coming}</B> <b><i>(\elth&#333;n\, second aorist active participle of<br>
 \erchomai\)</i></b>, taking <b><i>(\aras\, first aorist active participle of<br>
 \air&#333;\, to take up)</i></b>, <B>{binding}</B> <b><i>(\d&#275;sas\, first aorist active<br>
 participle of \de&#333;\, to bind)</i></b>. Vivid use of three successive<br>
 participles describing the dramatic action of Agabus. <B>{Paul's<br>
 girdle}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n z&#333;n&#275;n tou Paulou\)</i></b>. Old word from \z&#333;nnumi\, to<br>
 gird. See on &#175;12:8. <B>{His own feet and hands}</B> <b><i>(\heautou tous<br>
 podas kai tas cheiras\)</i></b>. Basis for the interpretation. Old<br>
 Testament prophets often employed symbolic deeds <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ki 22:11; Jas<br>
 2:2; Jer 13:1-7; Eze 4:1-6)</i></b>. Jesus interpreted the symbolism of<br>
 Peter's girding himself <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 21:18)</i></b>. <B>{So}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s\)</i></b>. As Agabus<br>
 had bound himself. Agabus was just from Jerusalem and probably<br>
 knew the feeling there against Paul. At any rate the Holy Spirit<br>
 revealed it to him as he claims. <B>{Shall deliver}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\parad&#333;sousin\)</i></b>. Like the words of Jesus about himself <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 20:19)</i></b>. He was "delivered" into the hands of the Gentiles and it<br>
 took five years to get out of those hands.<br>
 <br>
 21:12 <B>{Both we and they of that place}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meis te kai hoi<br>
 entopioi\)</i></b>. Usual use of \te kai\ <b><i>(both--and)</i></b>. \Entopioi\, old<br>
 word, only here in N.T. <B>{Not to go up}</B> <b><i>(\tou m&#275; anabainein\)</i></b>.<br>
 Probably ablative of the articular present active infinitive with<br>
 redundant negative \me\ after \parekaloumen\ <b><i>(imperfect active,<br>
 conative)</i></b>. We tried to persuade him from going up. It can be<br>
 explained as genitive, but not so likely: We tried to persuade<br>
 him in respect to not going up. Vincent cites the case of Regulus<br>
 who insisted on returning from Rome to Carthage to certain death<br>
 and that of Luther on the way to the Diet of Worms. Spalatin<br>
 begged Luther not to go on. Luther said: "Though devils be as<br>
 many in Worms as tiles upon the roofs, yet thither will I go."<br>
 This dramatic warning of Agabus came on top of that in Tyre<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->21:4)</i></b> and Paul's own confession in Miletus <b><i>(<!-#-->20:23)</i></b>. It is<br>
 small wonder that Luke and the other messengers together with<br>
 Philip and his daughters <b><i>(prophetesses versus prophet?)</i></b> joined in<br>
 a chorus of dissuasion to Paul.<br>
 <br>
 21:13 <B>{What are you doing weeping?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti poieite klaiontes?\)</i></b><br>
 Strong protest as in <!-#-->Mr 11:5. <B>{Breaking my heart}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sunthruptontes mou t&#275;n kardian\)</i></b>. The verb \sunthrupt&#333;\, to<br>
 crush together, is late _Koin&#275;_ for \apothrupt&#333;\, to break off,<br>
 both vivid and expressive words. So to enervate and unman one,<br>
 weakening Paul's determination to go on with his duty. <B>{I am<br>
 ready}</B> <b><i>(\Eg&#333; hetoim&#333;s ech&#333;\)</i></b>. I hold <b><i>(myself)</i></b> in readiness<br>
 <b><i>(adverb, \hetoim&#333;s\)</i></b>. Same idiom in <!-#-->2Co 12:14. <B>{Not only to be<br>
 bound}</B> <b><i>(\ou monon deth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist passive infinitive of<br>
 \de&#333;\ and note \ou monon\ rather than \m&#275; monon\, the usual<br>
 negative of the infinitive because of the sharp contrast<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1095)</i></b>. Paul's readiness to die, if need<br>
 be, at Jerusalem is like that of Jesus on the way to Jerusalem<br>
 the last time. Even before that Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->9:51)</i></b> said that "he set<br>
 his face to go on to Jerusalem." Later the disciples will say to<br>
 Jesus, "Master, the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and<br>
 goest thou thither?" <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 11:8)</i></b>. The stature of Paul rises here<br>
 to heroic proportions "for the name of the Lord Jesus" <b><i>(\huper<br>
 tou onomatos tou kuriou I&#275;sou\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 21:14 <B>{When he would not be persuaded}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; peithomenou autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute of the present passive participle of \peith&#333;\.<br>
 Literally, "he not being persuaded." That was all. Paul's will<br>
 <b><i>(\kardia\)</i></b> was not broken, not even bent. <B>{We ceased}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\h&#275;suchasamen\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist active indicative of<br>
 \h&#275;suchaz&#333;\, old verb to be quiet, silent. <B>{The will of the Lord<br>
 be done}</B> <b><i>(\tou kuriou to thel&#275;ma ginesth&#333;\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 imperative of \ginomai\. There is a quaint naivete in this<br>
 confession by the friends of Paul. Since Paul would not let them<br>
 have their way, they were willing for the Lord to have his way,<br>
 acquiescence after failure to have theirs.<br>
 <br>
 21:15 <B>{We took up our baggage}</B> <b><i>(\episkeuasamenoi\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 middle participle of \episkeuaz&#333;\, old verb to furnish <b><i>(\skeuos,<br>
 epi\)</i></b> with things necessary, to pack up, saddle horses here<br>
 Ramsay holds. Here only in the N.T. <B>{Went up}</B> <b><i>(\anebainomen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Inchoative imperfect active of \anabain&#333;\, we started to go up.<br>
 <br>
 21:16 <B>{Certain of the disciples}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n math&#275;t&#333;n\)</i></b>. The genitive<br>
 here occurs with \tines\ understood as often in the Greek idiom,<br>
 the partitive genitive used as nominative <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_,<br>
 p. 502)</i></b>. <B>{Bringing}</B> <b><i>(\agontes\)</i></b>. Nominative plural participle<br>
 agreeing with \tines\ understood, not with case of \math&#275;t&#333;n\.<br>
 <B>{One Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should<br>
 lodge}</B> <b><i>(\par h&#333;i xenisth&#333;men Mnas&#333;ni tini Kupri&#333;i archai&#333;i<br>
 math&#275;t&#275;i\)</i></b>. A thoroughly idiomatic Greek idiom, incorporation and<br>
 attraction of the antecedent into the relative clause <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 718)</i></b>. \Mnas&#333;ni\ is really the object of \agontes\<br>
 or the accusative with \para\ or \pros\ understood and should be<br>
 accusative, but it is placed in the clause after the relative and<br>
 in the same locative case with the relative \h&#333;i\ <b><i>(due to \par'\,<br>
 beside, with)</i></b>. Then the rest agrees in case with \Mnas&#333;ni\. He<br>
 was originally from Cyprus, but now in Caesarea. The Codex Bezae<br>
 adds \eis tina k&#333;m&#275;n\ <b><i>(to a certain village)</i></b> and makes it mean<br>
 that they were to lodge with Mnason at his home there about<br>
 halfway to Jerusalem. This may be true. The use of the<br>
 subjunctive \xenisth&#333;men\ <b><i>(first aorist passive of \xeniz&#333;\, to<br>
 entertain strangers as in <!-#-->Ac 10:6,23,32 already)</i></b> may be<br>
 volitive of purpose with the relative <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp.<br>
 955, 989)</i></b>. The use of \archai&#333;i\ for "early" may refer to the<br>
 fact that he was one of the original disciples at Pentecost as<br>
 Peter in <!-#-->15:7 uses \h&#275;mer&#333;n archai&#333;n\ <b><i>(early days)</i></b> to refer to<br>
 his experience at Ceasarea in <!-#-->Ac 10. "As the number of the<br>
 first disciples lessened, the next generation accorded a sort of<br>
 honour to the survivors" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 21:17 <B>{When we were come}</B> <b><i>(\genomen&#333;n h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute<br>
 again, "we having come." <B>{Received}</B> <b><i>(\apedexanto\)</i></b>.<br>
 \Apodechomai\, to receive from. This old compound only in Luke in<br>
 the N.T. <B>{Gladly}</B> <b><i>(\asmen&#333;s\)</i></b>. Old adverb \h&#275;smen&#333;s\ from<br>
 \h&#275;domai\, to be pleased. Here only in the N.T. Perhaps this<br>
 first glad welcome was from Paul's personal friends in Jerusalem.<br>
 <br>
 21:18 <B>{The day following}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i epious&#275;i\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->20:15 which<br>
 see. <B>{Went in}</B> <b><i>(\eis&#275;iei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \eiseimi\, old<br>
 classic verb used only four times in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 3:3; 21:18,26;<br>
 Heb 9:6)</i></b>, a mark of the literary style rather than the<br>
 colloquial _Koin&#275;_ use of \eiserchomai\. Together with us to<br>
 James <b><i>(\sun h&#275;min pros Iak&#333;bon\)</i></b>. So then Luke is present. The<br>
 next use of "we" is in <!-#-->27:1 when they leave Caesarea for Rome,<br>
 but it is not likely that Luke was away from Paul in Jerusalem<br>
 and Caesarea. The reports of what was done and said in both<br>
 places is so full and minute that it seems reasonable that Luke<br>
 got first hand information here whatever his motive was for so<br>
 full an account of these legal proceedings to be discussed later.<br>
 There are many details that read like an eye witness's story<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->21:30,35,40; 22:2,3; 23:12, etc.)</i></b>. It was probably the house<br>
 of James <b><i>(\pros\ and \para\ so used often)</i></b>. <B>{And all the elders<br>
 were present}</B> <b><i>(\pantes te paregenonto hoi presbuteroi\)</i></b>. Clearly<br>
 James is the leading elder and the others are his guests in a<br>
 formal reception to Paul. It is noticeable that the apostles are<br>
 not mentioned, though both elders and apostles are named at the<br>
 Conference in chapter 15. It would seem that the apostles are<br>
 away on preaching tours. The whole church was not called together<br>
 probably because of the known prejudice against Paul created by<br>
 the Judaizers.<br>
 <br>
 21:19 <B>{He rehearsed}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#275;geito\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of<br>
 \ex&#275;geomai\, old verb to lead out, to draw out in narrative, to<br>
 recount. So Paul is pictured as taking his time for he had a<br>
 great story to tell of what had happened since they saw him last.<br>
 <B>{One by one}</B> <b><i>(\kath' hena hekaston\)</i></b>. According to each one<br>
 <b><i>(item)</i></b> and the adverbial phrase used as an accusative after the<br>
 verb \ex&#275;geito\ as Demosthenes does <b><i>(1265)</i></b>, though it could be<br>
 like \kath' hena hekastos\ in <!-#-->Eph 5:33. <B>{Which}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive attracted from \ha\ <b><i>(accusative)</i></b> into the case of the<br>
 unexpressed antecedent \tout&#333;n\. <B>{God had wrought}</B> <b><i>(\epoi&#275;sen ho<br>
 theos\)</i></b>. Summary constative aorist active indicative that gathers<br>
 up all that God did and he takes pains to give God the glory. It<br>
 is possible that at this formal meeting Paul observed an absence<br>
 of warmth and enthusiasm in contrast with the welcome accorded by<br>
 his friends the day before <b><i>(verse <!-#-->17)</i></b>. Furneaux thinks that<br>
 Paul was coldly received on this day in spite of the generous<br>
 offering brought from the Gentile Christians. "It looks as though<br>
 his misgiving as to its reception <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 15:31)</i></b> was confirmed. Nor<br>
 do we hear that the Christians of Jerusalem later put in so much<br>
 as a word on his behalf with either the Jewish or the Roman<br>
 authorities, or expressed any sympathy with him during his long<br>
 imprisonment at Caesarea" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. The most that can be said<br>
 is that the Judaizers referred to by James do not appear actively<br>
 against him. The collection and the plan proposed by James<br>
 accomplished that much at any rate. It stopped the mouths of<br>
 those lions.<br>
 <br>
 21:20 <B>{Glorified}</B> <b><i>(\edoxazon\)</i></b>. Inchoative imperfect, began to<br>
 glorify God, though without special praise of Paul. <B>{How many<br>
 thousands}</B> <b><i>(\posai muriades\)</i></b>. Old word for ten thousand <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 19:19)</i></b> and then an indefinite number like our "myriads" <b><i>(this<br>
 very word)</i></b> as <!-#-->Lu 12:1; Ac 21:20; Jude 1:14; Re 5:11; 9:16. But<br>
 it is a surprising statement even with allowable hyperbole, but<br>
 one may recall <!-#-->Ac 4:4 <b><i>(number of the men--not women--about five<br>
 thousand)</i></b>; <!-#-->5:14 <b><i>(multitudes both of men and women)</i></b>; <!-#-->6:7.<br>
 There were undoubtedly a great many thousands of believers in<br>
 Jerusalem and all Jewish Christians, some, alas, Judaizers <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 11:2; 15:1,5)</i></b>. This list may include the Christians from<br>
 neighbouring towns in Palestine and even some from foreign<br>
 countries here at the Feast of Pentecost, for it is probable that<br>
 Paul arrived in time for it as he had hoped. But we do not have<br>
 to count the hostile Jews from Asia <b><i>(verse <!-#-->27)</i></b> who were clearly<br>
 not Christians at all. <B>{All zealous for the law}</B> <b><i>(\pantes z&#275;l&#333;tai<br>
 tou nomou\)</i></b>. Zealots <b><i>(substantive)</i></b> rather than zealous<br>
 <b><i>(adjective)</i></b> with objective genitive <b><i>(\tou nomou\)</i></b>. The word<br>
 zealot is from \z&#275;lo&#333;\, to burn with zeal, to boil. The Greek<br>
 used \z&#275;l&#333;t&#275;s\ for an imitator or admirer. There was a party of<br>
 Zealots <b><i>(developed from the Pharisees)</i></b>, a group of what would be<br>
 called "hot-heads," who brought on the war with Rome. One of this<br>
 party, Simon Zelotes <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 1:13)</i></b>, was in the number of the twelve<br>
 apostles. It is important to understand the issues in Jerusalem.<br>
 It was settled at the Jerusalem Conference <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15; Ga 2)</i></b> that<br>
 the Mosaic ceremonial law was not to be imposed upon Gentile<br>
 Christians. Paul won freedom for them, but it was not said that<br>
 it was wrong for Jewish Christians to go on observing it if they<br>
 wished. We have seen Paul observing the passover in Philippi <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 20:6)</i></b> and planning to reach Jerusalem for Pentecost <b><i>(<!-#-->20:16)</i></b>.<br>
 The Judaizers rankled under Paul's victory and power in spreading<br>
 the gospel among the Gentiles and gave him great trouble in<br>
 Galatia and Corinth. They were busy against him in Jerusalem also<br>
 and it was to undo the harm done by them in Jerusalem that Paul<br>
 gathered the great collection from the Gentile Christians and<br>
 brought it with him and the delegates from the churches. Clearly<br>
 then Paul had real ground for his apprehension of trouble in<br>
 Jerusalem while still in Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 15:25)</i></b> when he asked for<br>
 the prayers of the Roman Christians <b><i>(verses <!-#-->30-32)</i></b>. The<br>
 repeated warnings along the way were amply justified.<br>
 <br>
 21:21 <B>{They have been informed concerning thee}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;ch&#275;th&#275;san<br>
 peri sou\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of \kat&#275;che&#333;\. A word<br>
 in the ancient Greek, but a few examples survive in the papyri.<br>
 It means to sound <b><i>(echo, from \&#275;ch&#333;\, our word)</i></b> down <b><i>(\kata\)</i></b>, to<br>
 resound, re-echo, to teach orally. Oriental students today <b><i>(Arabs<br>
 learning the Koran)</i></b> often study aloud. In the N.T. only in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 1:4 which see; <!-#-->Ac 18:25; 21:21; 1Co 14:19; Ga 6:6; Ro 2:18.<br>
 This oral teaching about Paul was done diligently by the<br>
 Judaizers who had raised trouble against Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:2)</i></b> and<br>
 Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->15:1,5)</i></b>. They had failed in their attacks on Paul's world<br>
 campaigns. Now they try to undermine him at home. In Paul's long<br>
 absence from Jerusalem, since <!-#-->18:22, they have had a free hand,<br>
 save what opposition James would give, and have had great success<br>
 in prejudicing the Jerusalem Christians against Paul. So James,<br>
 in the presence of the other elders and probably at their<br>
 suggestion, feels called upon to tell Paul the actual situation.<br>
 <B>{That thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to<br>
 forsake Moses}</B> <b><i>(\hoti apostasian didaskeis apo M&#333;use&#333;s tous kata<br>
 ta ethn&#275; pantas Ioudaious\)</i></b>. Two accusatives with \didaskeis\<br>
 <b><i>(verb of teaching)</i></b> according to rule. Literally, "That thou art<br>
 teaching all the Jews among <b><i>(\kata\)</i></b> the Gentiles <b><i>(the Jews of<br>
 the dispersion as in <!-#-->2:9)</i></b> apostasy from Moses." That is the<br>
 point, the dreadful word \apostasian\ <b><i>(our apostasy)</i></b>, a late form<br>
 <b><i>(I Macc. 2:15)</i></b> for the earlier \apostasis\ <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->2Th 2:3 for<br>
 \apostasia\)</i></b>. "In the eyes of the church at Jerusalem this was a<br>
 far more serious matter than the previous question at the<br>
 Conference about the status of Gentile converts" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 had brought that issue to the Jerusalem Conference because of the<br>
 contention of the Judaizers. But here it is not the Judaizers,<br>
 but the elders of the church with James as their spokesman on<br>
 behalf of the church as a whole. They do not believe this false<br>
 charge, but they wish Paul to set it straight. Paul had made his<br>
 position clear in his Epistles <b><i>(I Corinthians, Galatians, Romans)</i></b><br>
 for all who cared to know. <B>{Telling them not to circumcise their<br>
 children}</B> <b><i>(\leg&#333;n m&#275; peritemnein autous ta tekna\)</i></b>. The<br>
 participle \leg&#333;n\ agrees with "thou" <b><i>(Paul)</i></b>, the subject of<br>
 \didaskeis\. This is not indirect assertion, but indirect<br>
 command, hence the negative \m&#275;\ instead of \ou\ with the<br>
 infinitive <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.1046)</i></b>. The point is not that<br>
 Paul stated what the Jewish Christians in the dispersion do, but<br>
 that he says that they <b><i>(\autous\ accusative of general reference)</i></b><br>
 are not to go on circumcising <b><i>(\peritemnein\, present active<br>
 infinitive)</i></b> their children. Paul taught the very opposite <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 7:18)</i></b> and had Timothy circumcised <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 16:3)</i></b> because he was<br>
 half Jew and half Greek. His own practice is stated in <!-#-->1Co 9:19<br>
 <b><i>("to the Jews as a Jew")</i></b>. <B>{Neither to walk after the customs}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275;de tois ethesin peripatein\)</i></b>. Locative case with infinitive<br>
 \peripatein\. The charge was here enlarged to cover it all and to<br>
 make Paul out an enemy of Jewish life and teachings. That same<br>
 charge had been made against Stephen when young Saul <b><i>(Paul)</i></b> was<br>
 the leader <b><i>(<!-#-->6:14)</i></b>: "Will change the customs <b><i>(\eth&#275;\ the very<br>
 word used here)</i></b> which Moses delivered unto us." It actually<br>
 seemed that some of the Jews cared more for Moses than for God<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 6:11)</i></b>. So much for the charge of the Judaizers.<br>
 <br>
 21:22 <B>{What is it therefore?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti oun estin?\)</i></b>. See this form of<br>
 question by Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 14:15,26)</i></b>. What is to be done about it?<br>
 Clearly James and the elders do not believe these<br>
 misrepresentations of Paul's teaching, but many do. <B>{They will<br>
 certainly hear}</B> <b><i>(\pant&#333;s akousontai\)</i></b>. \Pant&#333;s\ is old adverb, by<br>
 all means, altogether, wholly, certainly as here and <!-#-->28:4; Lu<br>
 4:23; 1Co 9:10. This future middle of \akou&#333;\ is the usual form<br>
 instead of \akous&#333;\. There was no way to conceal Paul's arrival<br>
 nor was it wise to do so. B C and several cursives omit \dei<br>
 pl&#275;thos sunelthein\ <b><i>(The multitude must needs come together)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 21:23 <B>{Do therefore this}</B> <b><i>(\touto oun poi&#275;son\)</i></b>. The elders had<br>
 thought out a plan of procedure by which Paul could set the whole<br>
 matter straight. <B>{We have}</B> <b><i>(\eisin h&#275;min\)</i></b>. "There are to us"<br>
 <b><i>(dative of possession as in <!-#-->18:10)</i></b>. Apparently members of the<br>
 Jerusalem church. <B>{Which have a vow on them}</B> <b><i>(\euch&#275;n echontes<br>
 aph'\-- or \eph' heaut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Apparently a temporary Nazarite vow<br>
 like that in <!-#-->Nu 6:1-21 and its completion was marked by several<br>
 offerings in the temple, the shaving of the head <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 6:13-15)</i></b>.<br>
 Either Paul or Aquila had such a vow on leaving Cenchreae <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 18:18)</i></b>. "It was considered a work of piety to relieve needy Jews<br>
 from the expenses connected with this vow, as Paul does here"<br>
 <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. The reading \aph' heaut&#333;n\ would mean that they had taken<br>
 the vow voluntarily or of themselves <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 12:57; 2Co 3:5)</i></b>, while<br>
 \eph' heaut&#333;n\ means that the vow lies on them still.<br>
 <br>
 21:24 <B>{These take}</B> <b><i>(\toutous paralab&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \paralamban&#333;\. Taking these alone. <B>{Purify thyself<br>
 with them}</B> <b><i>(\hagnisth&#275;ti sun autois\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 imperative of \hagniz&#333;\, old verb to purify, to make pure<br>
 <b><i>(\hagnos\)</i></b>. See the active voice in <!-#-->Jas 4:8; 1Pe 1:22; 1Jo 3:3.<br>
 It is possible to see the full passive force here, "Be purified."<br>
 But a number of aorist passives in the _Koin&#275;_ supplant the<br>
 aorist middle forms and preserve the force of the middle<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 819)</i></b>. That is possible here. Hence,<br>
 "Purify thyself" is allowable. The word occurs in <!-#-->Nu 6:1 for<br>
 taking the Nazarite vow. The point is that Paul takes the vow<br>
 with them. Note \hagnismou\ in verse <!-#-->26. <B>{Be at charges for<br>
 them}</B> <b><i>(\dapan&#275;son ep' autois\)</i></b>. First aorist active imperative of<br>
 old verb \dapana&#333;\, to incur expense, expend. Spend <b><i>(money)</i></b> upon<br>
 <b><i>(\ep'\)</i></b> them. Ramsay <b><i>(_St. Paul the Traveller_, etc., p. 310)</i></b><br>
 argues that Paul had use of considerable money at this period,<br>
 perhaps from his father's estate. The charges for five men would<br>
 be considerable. "A poor man would not have been treated with the<br>
 respect paid him at Caesarea, on the voyage, and at Rome"<br>
 <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. <B>{That they may shave their heads}</B> <b><i>(\hina xur&#275;sontai<br>
 t&#275;n kephal&#275;n\)</i></b>. Note \t&#275;n kephal&#275;n\, the head <b><i>(singular)</i></b>. Future<br>
 middle indicative of \xura&#333;\, late form for the old \xure&#333;\, to<br>
 shave, middle to shave oneself or <b><i>(causative)</i></b> to get oneself<br>
 shaved. This use of \hina\ with the future indicative is like the<br>
 classic \hop&#333;s\ with the future indicative and is common in the<br>
 N.T. as in the _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 984)</i></b>. <B>{And all<br>
 shall know}</B> <b><i>(\kai gn&#333;sontai\)</i></b>. This future middle indicative of<br>
 \gin&#333;sk&#333;\ <b><i>(cf. \akousontai\ in verse <!-#-->22)</i></b> may be independent of<br>
 \hina\ or dependent on it like \xur&#275;sontai\, though some MSS. <b><i>(H<br>
 L P)</i></b> have \gn&#333;sin\ <b><i>(second aorist subjunctive, clearly dependent<br>
 on \hina\)</i></b>. <B>{Of which}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive plural of the relative<br>
 \ha\ <b><i>(accusative)</i></b> object of the perfect passive verb<br>
 \kat&#275;ch&#275;ntai\ <b><i>(cf. verse <!-#-->21 \kat&#275;ch&#275;th&#275;san\)</i></b> attracted into the<br>
 case of the omitted antecedent \tout&#333;n\. The instruction still in<br>
 effect. <B>{But that thou thyself walkest orderly}</B> <b><i>(\alla stoicheis<br>
 kai autos\)</i></b>. \Stoicheis\ is an old verb to go in a row <b><i>(from<br>
 \stoichos\, row, rank, series)</i></b>, to walk in a line or by rule. In<br>
 the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ga 5:25; Ro 4:12; Php 3:16. The rule is<br>
 the law and Paul was not a sidestepper. The idea of the verb is<br>
 made plain by the participle \phulass&#333;n ton nomon\ <b><i>(keeping or<br>
 observing the law)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 21:25 <B>{We wrote}</B> <b><i>(\epesteilamen\)</i></b>. First aorist active of<br>
 \epistell&#333;\, to send to and so to write like our epistle<br>
 <b><i>(\epistol&#275;\)</i></b>. Old verb, but in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ac 15:20;<br>
 Heb 13:22. It is the very word used by James in this "judgment"<br>
 at the Conference <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:20, \episteilai\)</i></b>. B D here read<br>
 \apesteilamen\ from \apostell&#333;\, to send away, to give orders.<br>
 Wendt and Schuerer object to this as a gloss. Rather is it an<br>
 explanation by James that he does not refer to the Gentile<br>
 Christians whose freedom from the Mosaic ceremonial law was<br>
 guaranteed at the Jerusalem Conference. James himself presided at<br>
 that Conference and offered the resolution that was unanimously<br>
 adopted. James stands by that agreement and repeats the main<br>
 items <b><i>(four: anything sacrificed to idols, blood, anything<br>
 strangled, fornication, for discussion see <!-#-->Ac 15)</i></b> from which<br>
 they are to keep themselves <b><i>(direct middle \phulassesthai\ of<br>
 \phulass&#333;\, indirect command after \krinantes\ with accusative,<br>
 \autous\, of general reference)</i></b>. James has thus again cleared the<br>
 air about the Gentiles who have believed <b><i>(\pepisteukot&#333;n\,<br>
 perfect active participle genitive plural of \pisteu&#333;\)</i></b>. He asks<br>
 that Paul will stand by the right of Jewish Christians to keep on<br>
 observing the Mosaic law. He has put the case squarely and<br>
 fairly.<br>
 <br>
 21:26 <B>{Took the men}</B> <b><i>(\paralab&#333;n tous andras\)</i></b>. The very phrase<br>
 used in verse <!-#-->24 to Paul. <B>{The next day}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i echomen&#275;i\)</i></b>. One<br>
 of the phrases in <!-#-->20:15 for the coming day. Locative case of<br>
 time. <B>{Purifying himself with them}</B> <b><i>(\sun autois hagnistheis\,<br>
 first aorist passive participle of \hagniz&#333;\)</i></b>. The precise<br>
 language again of the recommendation in verse <!-#-->24. Paul was<br>
 conforming to the letter. <B>{Went into the temple}</B> <b><i>(\eis&#275;iei eis to<br>
 hieron\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \eiseimi\ as in verse <!-#-->18 which<br>
 see. Went on into the temple, descriptive imperfect. Paul joined<br>
 the four men in their vow of separation. <B>{Declaring}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\diaggell&#333;n\)</i></b>. To the priests what day he would report the<br>
 fulfilment of the vow. The priests would desire notice of the<br>
 sacrifice. This verb only used by Luke in N.T. except <!-#-->Ro 11:17<br>
 <b><i>(quotation from the LXX)</i></b>. It is not necessary to assume that the<br>
 vows of each of the five expired on the same day <b><i>(Rackham)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Until the offering was offered for every one of them}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s hou<br>
 pros&#275;nechth&#275; huper henos hekastou aut&#333;n h&#275; prosphora\)</i></b>. This use<br>
 of \he&#333;s hou\ <b><i>(like \he&#333;s\, alone)</i></b> with the first aorist passive<br>
 indicative \pros&#275;nechth&#275;\ of \prospher&#333;\, to offer, contemplates<br>
 the final result <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 974f.)</i></b> and is<br>
 probably the statement of Luke added to Paul's announcement. He<br>
 probably went into the temple one day for each of the brethren<br>
 and one for himself. The question arises whether Paul acted<br>
 wisely or unwisely in agreeing to the suggestion of James. What<br>
 he did was in perfect harmony with his principle of accommodation<br>
 in <!-#-->1Co 9:20 when no principle was involved. It is charged that<br>
 here on this occasion Paul was unduly influenced by<br>
 considerations of expediency and was willing for the Jewish<br>
 Christians to believe him more of a Jew than was true in order to<br>
 placate the situation in Jerusalem. Furneaux calls it a<br>
 compromise and a failure. I do not so see it. To say that is to<br>
 obscure the whole complex situation. What Paul did was not for<br>
 the purpose of conciliating his opponents, the Judaizers, who had<br>
 diligently spread falsehoods about him in Jerusalem as in<br>
 Corinth. It was solely to break the power of these "false<br>
 apostles" over the thousands in Jerusalem who have been deluded<br>
 by Paul's accusers. So far as the evidence goes that thing was<br>
 accomplished. In the trouble that comes in Jerusalem and Caesarea<br>
 the Judaizers cut no figure at all. The Jewish Christians do not<br>
 appear in Paul's behalf, but there was no opportunity for them to<br>
 do so. The explosion that came on the last day of Paul's<br>
 appearance in the temple was wholly disconnected from his<br>
 offerings for the four brethren and himself. It must be<br>
 remembered that Paul had many kinds of enemies. The attack on him<br>
 by these Jews from Asia had no connexion whatever with the<br>
 slanders of the Judaizers about Paul's alleged teachings that<br>
 Jewish Christians in the dispersion should depart from the Mosaic<br>
 law. That slander was put to rest forever by his following the<br>
 advice of James and justifies the wisdom of that advice and<br>
 Paul's conduct about it.<br>
 <br>
 21:27 <B>{The seven days}</B> <b><i>(\hai hepta h&#275;merai\)</i></b>. For which Paul had<br>
 taken the vow, though there may be an allusion to the pentecostal<br>
 week for which Paul had desired to be present <b><i>(<!-#-->20:16)</i></b>. There is<br>
 no necessary connexion with the vow in <!-#-->18:15. In <!-#-->24:17 Paul<br>
 makes a general reference to his purpose in coming to Jerusalem<br>
 to bring alms and offerings <b><i>(\prosphoras\, sacrifices)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 spent seven days in Troas <b><i>(<!-#-->20:6)</i></b>, Tyre <b><i>(<!-#-->21:4)</i></b>, and had<br>
 planned for seven here if not more. It was on the last of the<br>
 seven days when Paul was completing his offerings about the vows<br>
 on all five that the incident occurred that was to make him a<br>
 prisoner for five years. <B>{When they saw him in the temple}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\theasamenoi auton en t&#333;i hier&#333;i\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 participle of \theaomai\ <b><i>(from \thea\, a view, cf. theatre)</i></b> to<br>
 behold. In the very act of honouring the temple these Jews from<br>
 Asia raise a hue and cry that he is dishonouring it. Paul was not<br>
 known by face now to many of the Jerusalem Jews, though once the<br>
 leader of the persecution after the death of Stephen and the<br>
 outstanding young Jew of the day. But the Jews in Ephesus knew<br>
 him only too well, some of whom are here at the pentecostal<br>
 feast. They had plotted against him in Ephesus to no purpose <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 19:23-41; 20:19)</i></b>, but now a new opportunity had come. It is<br>
 possible that the cry was led by Alexander put forward by the<br>
 Jews in Ephesus <b><i>(<!-#-->19:33)</i></b> who may be the same as Alexander the<br>
 coppersmith who did Paul so much harm <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 4:14)</i></b>. Paul was not<br>
 in the inner sanctuary <b><i>(\ho naos\)</i></b>, but only in the outer courts<br>
 <b><i>(\to hieron\)</i></b>. <B>{Stirred up all the multitude}</B> <b><i>(\sunecheon panta<br>
 ton ochlon\)</i></b>. Imperfect <b><i>(kept on)</i></b> active of \sunche&#333;\ or<br>
 \sunchun&#333;\ <b><i>(\-unn&#333;\)</i></b>, to pour together, to confuse as in <!-#-->Ac 2:6;<br>
 9:22; 19:31,32; 21:31 and here to stir up by the same sort of<br>
 confusion created by Demetrius in Ephesus where the same word is<br>
 used twice <b><i>(<!-#-->19:31,32)</i></b>. The Jews from Ephesus had learned it<br>
 from Demetrius the silversmith. <B>{Laid hands on him}</B> <b><i>(\epebalan<br>
 ep' auton tas cheiras\)</i></b>. Second aorist <b><i>(ingressive, with endings<br>
 of the first aorist, \-an\)</i></b> active indicative of \epiball&#333;\, old<br>
 verb to lay upon, to attack <b><i>(note repetition of \epi\)</i></b>. They<br>
 attacked and seized Paul before the charge was made.<br>
 <br>
 21:28 <B>{Help}</B> <b><i>(\bo&#275;theite\)</i></b>. Present active imperative of<br>
 \bo&#275;the&#333;\, to run <b><i>(\the&#333;\)</i></b> at a cry <b><i>(\bo&#275;\)</i></b>, as if an outrage had<br>
 been committed like murder or assault. <B>{All men everywhere}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\panta pantach&#275;i\)</i></b>. Alliterative. \Pantach&#275;i\ is a variation in<br>
 MSS., often \pantachou\, and here only in the N.T. The charges<br>
 against Paul remind one of those against Stephen <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 6:13)</i></b> in<br>
 which Paul had participated according to his confession<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->22:20)</i></b>. Like the charges against Stephen and Jesus before him<br>
 truth and falsehood are mixed. Paul had said that being a Jew<br>
 would not save a man. He had taught the law of Moses was not<br>
 binding on Gentiles. He did hold, like Jesus and Stephen, that<br>
 the temple was not the only place to worship God. But Paul<br>
 gloried himself in being a Jew, considered the Mosaic law<br>
 righteous for Jews, and was honouring the temple at this very<br>
 moment. <B>{And moreover also he brought Greeks also into the<br>
 temple}</B> <b><i>(\eti te kai Hell&#275;nas eis&#275;gagen eis to hieron\)</i></b>. Note the<br>
 three particles <b><i>(\eti te kai\)</i></b>, <B>{and}</B> <b><i>(\te\)</i></b> <B>{still more}</B> <b><i>(\eti\)</i></b><br>
 <B>{also}</B> or <B>{even}</B> <b><i>(\kai\)</i></b>. Worse than his teaching <b><i>(\didask&#333;n\)</i></b> is<br>
 his dreadful deed: he actually brought <b><i>(\eis&#275;gagen\, second<br>
 aorist active indicative of \eisag&#333;\)</i></b>. This he had a right to do<br>
 if they only went into the court of the Gentiles. But these Jews<br>
 mean to imply that Paul had brought Greeks beyond this court into<br>
 the court of Israel. An inscription was found by Clermont-Ganneau<br>
 in Greek built into the walls of a mosque on the Via Dolorosa<br>
 that was on the wall dividing the court of Israel from the court<br>
 of the Gentiles. Death was the penalty to any Gentile who crossed<br>
 over into the Court of Israel <b><i>(_The Athenaeum_, July, 1871)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Hath defiled this holy place}</B> <b><i>(\kekoin&#333;ken ton hagion topon<br>
 touton\)</i></b>. Present perfect active of \koino&#333;\, to make common <b><i>(see<br>
 on &#175;10:14)</i></b>. Note vivid change of tense, the defilement lasts<br>
 <b><i>(state of completion)</i></b>. All this is the substance of the call of<br>
 these shrewd conspirators from Ephesus, Jews <b><i>(not Jewish<br>
 Christians, not even Judaizers)</i></b> who hated him for his work there<br>
 and who probably "spoke evil of the Way before the multitude"<br>
 there so that Paul had to separate the disciples from the<br>
 synagogue and go to the School of Tyrannus <b><i>(<!-#-->19:9f.)</i></b>. These<br>
 enemies of Paul had now raised the cry of "fire" and vanish from<br>
 the scene completely <b><i>(<!-#-->24:19)</i></b>. This charge was absolutely false<br>
 as we shall see, made out of inferences of hate and suspicion.<br>
 <br>
 21:29 <B>{For}</B> <b><i>(\gar\)</i></b>. Luke adds the reason for the wild charges<br>
 made against Paul. <B>{They had before seen}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san proe&#333;rakotes\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic past perfect of \proora&#333;\, old verb to see before,<br>
 whether time or place. Only twice in the N.T., here and <!-#-->Ac 2:25<br>
 quoted from <!-#-->Ps 15:8. Note the double reduplication in \-e&#333;-\ as<br>
 in Attic <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 364)</i></b>. <B>{With him in the city<br>
 Trophimus the Ephesian}</B> <b><i>(\Trophimon ton Ephesion en t&#275;i polei sun<br>
 aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. The Jews from Asia <b><i>(Ephesus)</i></b> knew Trophimus by sight as<br>
 well as Paul. One day they saw both of them together <b><i>(\sun\)</i></b> in<br>
 the city. That was a fact. They had just seized Paul in the<br>
 temple <b><i>(\hieron\)</i></b>. That was another fact. <B>{They supposed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\enomizon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \nomiz&#333;\, common to think or<br>
 suppose. Perfectly harmless word, but they did, as so many people<br>
 do, put their supposed inference on the same basis with the<br>
 facts. They did not see Trophimus with Paul now in the temple,<br>
 nor had they ever seen him there. They simply argued that, if<br>
 Paul was willing to be seen down street with a Greek Christian,<br>
 he would not hesitate to bring him <b><i>(therefore, did bring him,<br>
 \eis&#275;gagen\ as in verse <!-#-->28)</i></b> into the temple, that is into the<br>
 court of Israel and therefore both Paul and Trophimus were<br>
 entitled to death, especially Paul who had brought him in <b><i>(if he<br>
 had)</i></b> and, besides, they now had Paul. This is the way of the<br>
 mob-mind in all ages. Many an innocent man has been rushed to his<br>
 death by the fury of a lynching party.<br>
 <br>
 21:30 <B>{All the city was shaken}</B> <b><i>(\ekin&#275;th&#275; h&#275; polis hol&#275;\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive of \kine&#333;\, common verb for violent motion and<br>
 emotion. See also <!-#-->24:5 where the word is used by Tertullus of<br>
 Paul as the stirrer up of riots! <B>{The people ran together}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\egeneto sundrom&#275; tou laou\)</i></b>. Rather, There came a running<br>
 together <b><i>(\sun-drom&#275;\ from \sun-trech&#333;\)</i></b> of the people. The cry<br>
 spread like wildfire over the city and there was a pell-mell<br>
 scramble or rush to get to the place of the disturbance. <B>{They<br>
 laid hold on Paul}</B> <b><i>(\epilabomenoi tou Paulou\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 middle participle of \epilambanomai\ with the genitive <b><i>(cf.<br>
 \epebalan\ in verse <!-#-->27)</i></b>. <B>{Dragged}</B> <b><i>(\heilkon\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active of \helk&#333;\ <b><i>(and also \helku&#333;\)</i></b>, old verb to drag or draw.<br>
 Imperfect tense vividly pictures the act as going on. They were<br>
 saving the temple by dragging Paul outside. Curiously enough both<br>
 \epilabomenoi\ and \heilkusan\ occur in <!-#-->16:19 about the arrest<br>
 of Paul and Silas in Philippi. <B>{Straightway the doors were shut}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\euthe&#333;s ekleisth&#275;san hai thurai\)</i></b>. With a bang and at once.<br>
 First aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b> passive of \klei&#333;\. The doors between<br>
 the inner court and the court of the Gentiles. But this was only<br>
 the beginning, the preparation for the real work of the mob. They<br>
 did not wish to defile the holy place with blood. The doors were<br>
 shut by the Levites.<br>
 <br>
 21:31 <B>{As they were seeking to kill him}</B> <b><i>(\z&#275;tount&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute of \z&#275;te&#333;\, to seek, without \aut&#333;n\ <b><i>(they)</i></b>.<br>
 This was their real purpose. <B>{Tidings}</B> <b><i>(\phasis\)</i></b>. From \phain&#333;\,<br>
 to show. Old word for the work of informers and then the exposure<br>
 of secret crime. In LXX. Here only in the N.T. <B>{Came up}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aneb&#275;\)</i></b>. Naturally in the wild uproar. The Roman guard during<br>
 festivals was kept stationed in the Tower of Antonia at the<br>
 northwest corner of the temple overlooking the temple and<br>
 connected by stairs <b><i>(verse <!-#-->35)</i></b>. <B>{To the chief captain}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i<br>
 chiliarch&#333;i\)</i></b>. Commander of a thousand men or cohort <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 15:16)</i></b>. His name was Claudius Lysias. <B>{Of the band}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;s<br>
 speir&#275;s\)</i></b>. Each legion had six tribunes and so each tribune<br>
 <b><i>(chiliarch)</i></b> had a thousand if the cohort had its full quota. See<br>
 on &#175;10:1; 27:1. The word is the Latin _spira_ <b><i>(anything rolled<br>
 up)</i></b>. Note the genitive \speir&#275;s\ instead of \speiras\ <b><i>(Attic)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Was in confusion}</B> <b><i>(\sunchunnetai\)</i></b>. Present passive indicative<br>
 of \sunchunn&#333;\ <b><i>(see verse <!-#-->27, \sunecheon\)</i></b>. This is what the<br>
 conspirators had desired.<br>
 <br>
 21:32 <B>{Forthwith}</B> <b><i>(\exaut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Common in the _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(\ex aut&#275;s\,<br>
 supply \h&#333;ras\, hour)</i></b>. <B>{He took}</B> <b><i>(\paralab&#333;n\)</i></b>. See verses<br>
 <!-#-->24,26. <B>{Centurions}</B> <b><i>(\hekatontarchas\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Lu 7:2 for<br>
 discussion. Plural shows that Lysias the chiliarch took several<br>
 hundred soldiers along <b><i>(a centurion with each hundred)</i></b>. <B>{Ran<br>
 down}</B> <b><i>(\katedramen\)</i></b>. Effective second aorist active indicative<br>
 of \katatrech&#333;\. From the tower of Antonia, vivid scene. <B>{And<br>
 they}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de\)</i></b>. Demonstrative use of \hoi\. The Jewish mob who<br>
 had begun the work of killing Paul <b><i>(verse <!-#-->31)</i></b>. <B>{Left off<br>
 beating Paul}</B> <b><i>(\epausanto tuptontes ton Paulon\)</i></b>. The participle<br>
 with \pauomai\ describes what they were already doing, the<br>
 supplementary participle <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1121)</i></b>. They<br>
 stopped before the job was over because of the sudden onset of<br>
 the Roman soldiers. Some ten years before in a riot at the<br>
 passover the Roman guard marched down and in the panic several<br>
 hundred were trampled to death.<br>
 <br>
 21:33 <B>{Came near}</B> <b><i>(\eggisas\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle of<br>
 \eggiz&#333;\, to draw near, _Koin&#275;_ verb from \eggus\, near, and<br>
 common in the N.T. <B>{Laid hold on him}</B> <b><i>(\epelabeto antou\)</i></b>. See<br>
 same verb in verse <!-#-->30. <B>{To be bound}</B> <b><i>(\deth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive infinitive of \de&#333;\ <b><i>(see verse <!-#-->11)</i></b>. <B>{With two chains}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\halusesi dusi\)</i></b>. Instrumental case of \halusis\, old word from<br>
 \a\ privative and \lu&#333;\ <b><i>(not loosing, i.e. chaining)</i></b>. With two<br>
 chains as a violent and seditious person, probably leader of a<br>
 band of assassins <b><i>(verse <!-#-->38)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mr 5:4. <B>{Inquired}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epunthaneto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of \punthanomai\, old and<br>
 common verb used mainly by Luke in the N.T. Lysias repeated his<br>
 inquiries. <B>{Who he was}</B> <b><i>(\tis ei&#275;\)</i></b>. Present active optative of<br>
 \eimi\ changed from \estin\ <b><i>(present indicative)</i></b> in the indirect<br>
 question, a change not obligatory after a past tense, but often<br>
 done in the older Greek, rare in the N.T. <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_,<br>
 p. 1043f.)</i></b>. <B>{And what he had done}</B> <b><i>(\kai ti estin pepoi&#275;k&#333;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic perfect active indicative of \poie&#333;\ here retained,<br>
 not changed to the optative as is true of \ei&#275;\ from \estin\ in<br>
 the same indirect question, illustrating well the freedom about<br>
 it.<br>
 <br>
 21:34 <B>{Some shouting one thing, some another}</B> <b><i>(\alloi allo ti<br>
 epeph&#333;noun\)</i></b>. Same idiom of \alloi allo\ as in <!-#-->19:32 which see.<br>
 The imperfect of \epiph&#333;ne&#333;\, to call out to, suits well the<br>
 idiom. This old verb occurs in the N.T. only in Luke and Acts<br>
 <b><i>(already in <!-#-->12:22)</i></b>. <B>{When he could not know}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; dunamenou<br>
 autou gn&#333;nai\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute of present middle participle of<br>
 \dunamai\ with negative \m&#275;\ and second aorist active infinitive<br>
 of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\. <B>{The certainty}</B> <b><i>(\to asphales\)</i></b>. Neuter articular<br>
 adjective from \a\ privative and \sphall&#333;\, to make totter or<br>
 fall. Old word, in the N.T. only in <!-#-->Ac 21:34; 22:30; 25:26; Php<br>
 3:1; Heb 6:19. <B>{Into the castle}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n parembol&#275;n\)</i></b>. _Koin&#275;_<br>
 word from \paremball&#333;\, to cast in by the side of, to assign<br>
 soldiers a place, to encamp <b><i>(see on &#175;Lu 19:43)</i></b>. So \parembol&#275;\<br>
 comes to mean an interpolation, then an army drawn up <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb<br>
 11:34)</i></b>, but mainly an encampment <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 13:11,13)</i></b>, frequent in<br>
 Polybius and LXX. So here barracks of the Roman soldiers in the<br>
 tower of Antonia as in verse <!-#-->37; 22:24; 23:10,16,32.<br>
 <br>
 21:35 <B>{Upon the stairs}</B> <b><i>(\epi tous anabathmous\)</i></b>. From \ana\, up,<br>
 and \bain&#333;\, to go. Late word, in LXX and _Koin&#275;_ writers. In the<br>
 N.T. only here and verse <!-#-->40. <B>{So it was}</B> <b><i>(\suneb&#275;\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active of \sumbain&#333;\, to happen <b><i>(see on &#175;20:19)</i></b> with<br>
 infinitive clause as subject here as often in the old Greek. <B>{He<br>
 was borne}</B> <b><i>(\bastazesthai auton\)</i></b>. Accusative of general<br>
 reference with this subject infinitive, present passive of<br>
 \bastaz&#333;\, to take up with the hands, literally as here.<br>
 <B>{Violence}</B> <b><i>(\bian\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Ac 5:26. \Biaz&#333;\, to use force, is<br>
 from \bia\.<br>
 <br>
 21:36 <B>{Followed after}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kolouthei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of<br>
 \akoluthe&#333;\, was following. Cheated of their purpose to lynch<br>
 Paul, they were determined to have his blood. <B>{Crying out}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\krazontes\)</i></b>. Construction according to sense, plural masculine<br>
 participle agreeing with neuter singular substantive \pl&#275;thos\<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 401)</i></b>. <B>{Away with him}</B> <b><i>(\Aire auton\)</i></b>.<br>
 The very words used by the mob to Pilate when they chose Barabbas<br>
 in preference to Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:18, \Aire touton\)</i></b>. He will hear<br>
 it again from this same crowd <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 22:22)</i></b>. It is the present<br>
 imperative <b><i>(\aire\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Lu 23:18, but some may have used the<br>
 urgent aorist active imperative as also in the case of Jesus <!-#-->Joh<br>
 19:15, \&#257;ron, &#257;ron\ with \staur&#333;son\ added). Luke does not say<br>
 that this mob demanded crucifixion for Paul. He was learning what<br>
 it was to share the sufferings of Christ as the sullen roar of<br>
 the mob's yells rolled on and on in his ears.<br>
 <br>
 21:37 <B>{May I say something unto thee?}</B> <b><i>(\Ei exestin moi eipein ti<br>
 pros se?\)</i></b>. On this use of \ei\ in a direct question see on<br>
 &#175;1:6. The calm self-control of Paul in the presence of this mob<br>
 is amazing. His courteous request to Lysias was in Greek to the<br>
 chiliarch's amazement. <B>{Dost thou know Greek?}</B> <b><i>(\Hell&#275;nisti<br>
 gin&#333;skeis?\)</i></b>. Old Greek adverb in \-i\ from \Hell&#275;niz&#333;\, meaning<br>
 "in Greek." "Do you know it in Greek?" In the N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->Joh 19:20. <B>{Art thou not then the Egyptian?}</B> <b><i>(\Ouk ara su ei ho<br>
 Aiguptios?\)</i></b>. Expects the answer _Yes_ and \ara\ argues the<br>
 matter <b><i>(therefore)</i></b>. The well-known <b><i>(\ho\)</i></b> Egyptian who had given<br>
 the Romans so much trouble. <B>{Stirred up to sedition}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anastat&#333;sas\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle of \anastato&#333;\, a<br>
 late verb from \anastatos\, outcast, and so to unsettle, to stir<br>
 up, to excite, once known only in LXX and <!-#-->Ac 17:6 <b><i>(which see)</i></b>;<br>
 <!-#-->21:38; Ga 5:12, but now found in several papyri examples with<br>
 precisely this sense to upset. <B>{Of the Assassins}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n<br>
 sikari&#333;n\)</i></b>. Latin word _sicarius_, one who carried a short sword<br>
 \sica\ under his cloak, a cutthroat. Josephus uses this very word<br>
 for bands of robbers under this Egyptian <b><i>(_War_ II. 17,6 and<br>
 13,5; _Ant_. XX. 8,10)</i></b>. Josephus says that there were 30,000 who<br>
 gathered on the Mount of Olives to see the walls of Jerusalem<br>
 fall down and not merely 4,000 as Lysias does here. But Lysias<br>
 may refer to the group that were armed thus <b><i>(banditti)</i></b> the core<br>
 of the mob of 30,000. Lysias at once saw by Paul's knowledge of<br>
 Greek that he was not the famous Egyptian who led the Assassins<br>
 and escaped himself when Felix attacked and slew the most of<br>
 them.<br>
 <br>
 21:39 <B>{I am}</B> <b><i>(\Eg&#333; men eimi\)</i></b>. In contrast with the wild guess of<br>
 Lysias Paul uses \men\ and \de\. He tells briefly who he is: <B>{a<br>
 Jew}</B> <b><i>(\Ioudaios\)</i></b> by race, <B>{of Tarsus in Cilicia}</B> <b><i>(\Tarseus t&#275;s<br>
 Kilikias\)</i></b> by country, belonging to Tarsus <b><i>(this adjective<br>
 \Tarseus\ only here and <!-#-->Ac 9:11)</i></b>, and proud of it, one of the<br>
 great cities of the empire with a great university. <B>{A citizen of<br>
 no mean city}</B> <b><i>(\ouk as&#275;mou pole&#333;s polit&#275;s\)</i></b>. Litotes again, "no<br>
 mean" <b><i>(\as&#275;mos\, old adjective, unmarked, \a\ privative and<br>
 \s&#275;ma\, mark, insignificant, here only in the N.T.)</i></b>. This same<br>
 litotes used by Euripides of Athens <b><i>(_Ion_ 8)</i></b>. But Paul calls<br>
 himself a citizen <b><i>(\polit&#275;s\)</i></b> of Tarsus. Note the "effective<br>
 assonance" <b><i>(Page)</i></b> in \pole&#333;s polit&#275;s\. Paul now <b><i>(\de\)</i></b> makes his<br>
 request <b><i>(\deomai\)</i></b> of Lysias. <B>{Give me leave}</B> <b><i>(\epitrepson moi\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active imperative of \epitrep&#333;\, old and common verb<br>
 to turn to, to permit, to allow. It was a strange request and a<br>
 daring one, to wish to speak to this mob howling for Paul's<br>
 blood.<br>
 <br>
 21:40 <B>{When he had given him leave}</B> <b><i>(\epitrepsantos autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute of aorist active participle of the same verb<br>
 \epitrep&#333;\. <B>{Standing on the stairs}</B> <b><i>(\hest&#333;s epi t&#333;n<br>
 anabathm&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second perfect active participle of \hist&#275;mi\, to<br>
 place, but intransitive to stand. Dramatic scene. Paul had faced<br>
 many audiences and crowds, but never one quite like this. Most<br>
 men would have feared to speak, but not so Paul. He will speak<br>
 about himself only as it gives him a chance to put Christ before<br>
 this angry Jewish mob who look on Paul as a renegade Jew, a<br>
 turncoat, a deserter, who went back on Gamaliel and all the<br>
 traditions of his people, who not only turned from Judaism to<br>
 Christianity, but who went after Gentiles and treated Gentiles as<br>
 if they were on a par with Jews. Paul knows only too well what<br>
 this mob thinks of him. <B>{Beckoned with the hand}</B> <b><i>(\kateseise t&#275;i<br>
 cheiri\)</i></b>. He shook down to the multitude with the hand<br>
 <b><i>(instrumental case \cheiri\)</i></b>, while Alexander, Luke says<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->19:33)</i></b>, "shook down the hand" <b><i>(accusative with the same verb,<br>
 which see)</i></b>. In <!-#-->26:1 Paul reached out the hand <b><i>(\ekteinas t&#275;n<br>
 cheira\)</i></b>. <B>{When there was made a great silence}</B> <b><i>(\poll&#275;s sig&#275;s<br>
 genomen&#275;s\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again with second aorist middle<br>
 participle of \ginomai\, "much silence having come." Paul waited<br>
 till silence had come. <B>{In the Hebrew language}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i Ebraidi<br>
 dialekt&#333;i\)</i></b>. The Aramaean which the people in Jerusalem knew<br>
 better than the Greek. Paul could use either tongue at will. His<br>
 enemies had said in Corinth that "his bodily presence was weak<br>
 and his speech contemptible" <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 10:10)</i></b>. But surely even they<br>
 would have to admit that Paul's stature and words reach heroic<br>
 proportions on this occasion. Self-possessed with majestic poise<br>
 Paul faces the outraged mob beneath the stairs.<br>
