<p>2:1 <B>{For yourselves know}</B> <b><i>(\autoi gar oidate\)</i></b>. This explanatory<br>
 \gar\ takes up in verses <!-#-->1-12 the allusion in <!-#-->1:9 about the<br>
 "report" concerning the entrance <b><i>(\eisodon\, way in, \eis,<br>
 hodon\)</i></b>, <B>{unto you}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n pros hum&#257;s\)</i></b>. Note repeated article to<br>
 sharpen the point. This proleptic accusative is common enough. It<br>
 is expanded by the epexegetic use of the \hoti\ clause <B>{that it<br>
 hath not been found vain}</B> <b><i>(\hoti ou ken&#275; gegonen\)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 <B>{that it has not become empty}</B>. Second perfect active <b><i>(completed<br>
 state)</i></b> of \ginomai\. Every pastor watches wistfully to see what<br>
 will be the outcome of his work. Bengel says: _Non inanis, sed<br>
 plena virtutis_. Cf. <!-#-->1:5. \Kenos\ is hollow, empty, while<br>
 \mataios\ is fruitless, ineffective. In <!-#-->1Co 15:14,17 Paul<br>
 speaks of \kenon to k&#275;rugma\ <b><i>(<B>{empty the preaching}</B>)</i></b> and \mataia<br>
 h&#275; pistis\ <b><i>(<B>{vain the faith}</B>)</i></b>. One easily leads to the other.<br>
 <br>
 2:2 <B>{But having suffered before}</B> <b><i>(\alla propathontes\)</i></b>. Strong<br>
 adversative \alla\, antithesis to \ken&#275;\. Appeal to his personal<br>
 experiences in Thessalonica known to them <b><i>(<B>{as ye know}</B>, \kath&#333;s<br>
 oidate\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of \propasch&#333;\, old<br>
 compound verb, but here alone in the N.T. The force of \pro-\<br>
 <b><i>(before)</i></b> is carried over to the next verb. The participle may be<br>
 regarded as temporal <b><i>(Ellicott)</i></b> or concessive <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>. <B>{And<br>
 been shamefully entreated in Philippi}</B> <b><i>(\kai hubristhentes en<br>
 Philippois\)</i></b>. First aorist passive participle of \hubriz&#333;\, old<br>
 verb, to treat insolently. "More than the bodily suffering it was<br>
 the personal indignity that had been offered to him as a Roman<br>
 citizen" <b><i>(Milligan)</i></b>, for which account see <!-#-->Ac 16:16-40, an<br>
 interesting example of how Acts and the Epistles throw light on<br>
 each other. Luke tells how Paul resented the treatment accorded<br>
 to him as a Roman citizen and here Paul shows that the memory<br>
 still rankled in his bosom. <B>{We waxed bold in our God}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eparr&#275;siasametha en t&#333;i the&#333;i h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. Ingressive first aorist<br>
 middle of \parr&#275;siazomai\, old deponent verb from \parr&#275;sia\<br>
 <b><i>(full story, \pan-, r&#275;sia\)</i></b>. In his reply to Festus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 26:26)</i></b><br>
 Paul uses \parr&#275;siazomenos lal&#333;\, <B>{being bold I speak}</B>, while<br>
 here he has <B>{we waxed bold to speak}</B> <b><i>(\eparr&#275;siasametha<br>
 lal&#275;sai\)</i></b>. The insult in Philippi did not close Paul's mouth, but<br>
 had precisely the opposite effect "in our God." It was not wild<br>
 fanaticism, but determined courage and confidence in God that<br>
 spurred Paul to still greater boldness in Thessalonica, <B>{unto<br>
 you}</B> <b><i>(\pros hum&#257;s\)</i></b>, be the consequences what they might, <B>{the<br>
 gospel of God in much conflict}</B>, <b><i>(\to euaggelion tou theou en<br>
 poll&#333;i ag&#333;ni\)</i></b>. This figure of the athletic games <b><i>(\ag&#333;n\)</i></b> may<br>
 refer to outward conflict like <!-#-->Php 1:30 or inward anxiety <b><i>(<!-#-->Col<br>
 2:1)</i></b>. He had both in Thessalonica.<br>
 <br>
 2:3 <B>{Exhortation}</B> <b><i>(\parakl&#275;sis\)</i></b>. Persuasive discourse, calling<br>
 to one's side, for admonition, encouragement, or comfort. <B>{Not of<br>
 error}</B> <b><i>(\ouk ek plan&#275;s\)</i></b>. This word is same as \plana&#333;\, to lead<br>
 astray <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 3:13)</i></b> like Latin _errare_. Passive idea of <B>{error}</B><br>
 here rather than deceit. That is seen in <B>{nor in guile}</B> <b><i>(\oude en<br>
 dol&#333;i\)</i></b> from \del&#333;\, to catch with bait. Paul is keenly sensitive<br>
 against charges against the correctness of his message and the<br>
 purity of his life. <B>{Nor of uncleanness}</B> <b><i>(\oude ex akatharsias\)</i></b>.<br>
 "This disclaimer, startling as it may seem, was not unneeded<br>
 amidst the impurities consecrated by the religions of the day"<br>
 <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. There was no necessary connection in the popular<br>
 mind between religion and morals. The ecstatic initiations in<br>
 some of the popular religions were grossly sensual.<br>
 <br>
 2:4 <B>{But even as we have been approved by God}</B> <b><i>(\alla kath&#333;s<br>
 dedokimasmetha hupo tou theou\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative of<br>
 \dokimaz&#333;\, old verb to put to the test, but here the tense for<br>
 completed state means tested and proved and so approved by God.<br>
 Paul here claims the call of God for his ministry and the seal of<br>
 God's blessing on his work and also for that of Silas and<br>
 Timothy. <B>{To be entrusted with the gospel}</B> <b><i>(\pisteuth&#275;nai to<br>
 euaggelion\)</i></b>. First aorist passive infinitive of \pisteu&#333;\,<br>
 common verb for believing, from \pistis\ <b><i>(faith)</i></b>, but here to<br>
 entrust rather than to trust. The accusative of the thing is<br>
 retained in the passive according to regular Greek idiom as in<br>
 <!-#-->1Co 9:17; Ga 2:7; Ro 3:2; 1Ti 1:11; Tit 1:3, though the active<br>
 had the dative of the person. <B>{So we speak}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s laloumen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Simple, yet confident claim of loyalty to God's call and message.<br>
 Surely this should be the ambition of every preacher of the<br>
 gospel of God. <B>{Not as pleasing men}</B> <b><i>(\ouch h&#333;s anthr&#333;pois<br>
 areskontes\)</i></b>. Dative case with \aresk&#333;\ as in <!-#-->Ga 1:10. Few<br>
 temptations assail the preacher more strongly than this one to<br>
 please men, even if God is not pleased, though with the dim hope<br>
 that God will after all condone or overlook. Nothing but<br>
 experience will convince some preachers how fickle is popular<br>
 favour and how often it is at the cost of failure to please God.<br>
 And yet the preacher wishes to win men to Christ. It is all as<br>
 subtle as it is deceptive. God tests our hearts <b><i>(the very verb<br>
 \dokimaz&#333;\ used in the beginning of this verse)</i></b> and he is the<br>
 only one whose approval matters in the end of the day <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 4:5)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:5 <B>{Using words of flattery}</B> <b><i>(\en log&#333;i kolakeias\)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 <B>{in speech of flattery or fawning}</B>. Old word, only here in N.T.,<br>
 from \kolaks\, a flatterer. An Epicurean, Philodemus, wrote a<br>
 work \Peri Kolakeias\ <b><i>(Concerning Flattery)</i></b>. Milligan<br>
 <b><i>(_Vocabulary_, etc.)</i></b> speaks of "the selfish conduct of too many<br>
 of the rhetoricians of the day," conduct extremely repugnant to<br>
 Paul. The third time <b><i>(verses <!-#-->1,2,5)</i></b> he appeals to their<br>
 knowledge of his work in Thessalonica. Frame suggests "cajolery."<br>
 <B>{Nor a cloke of covetousness}</B> <b><i>(\oute prophasei pleonexias\)</i></b>.<br>
 Pretext <b><i>(\prophasis\ from \prophain&#333;\, to show forth, or perhaps<br>
 from \pro-ph&#275;mi\, to speak forth)</i></b>. This is the charge of<br>
 self-interest rather than the mere desire to please people.<br>
 Pretext of greediness is Frame's translation. \Pleonexia\ is<br>
 merely "having more" from \pleonekt&#275;s\, one eager for more, and<br>
 \pleonekte&#333;\, to have more, then to over-reach, all old words,<br>
 all with bad meaning as the result of the desire for more. In a<br>
 preacher this sin is especially fatal. Paul feels so strongly his<br>
 innocence of this charge that he calls God as witness as in <!-#-->2Co<br>
 1:23; Ro 9:1; Php 1:8, a solemn oath for his own veracity.<br>
 <br>
 2:6 <B>{Nor seeking glory of men}</B> <b><i>(\oute z&#275;tountes ex anthr&#333;p&#333;n<br>
 doxan\)</i></b>. "Upon the repudiation of covetousness follows naturally<br>
 the repudiation of worldly ambition" <b><i>(Milligan)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ac 20:19;<br>
 2Co 4:5; Eph 4:2. This third disclaimer is as strong as the<br>
 other two. Paul and his associates had not tried to extract<br>
 praise or glory out of <b><i>(\ex\)</i></b> men. <B>{Neither from you nor from<br>
 others}</B> <b><i>(\oute aph' hum&#333;n oute aph' all&#333;n\)</i></b>. He widens the<br>
 negation to include those outside of the church circles and<br>
 changes the preposition from \ex\ <b><i>(out of)</i></b> to \apo\ <b><i>(from)</i></b>. <B>{When<br>
 we might have been burdensome, as apostles of Christ}</B> <b><i>(\dunamenoi<br>
 en barei einai h&#333;s Christou apostoloi\)</i></b>. Westcott and Hort put<br>
 this clause in verse <!-#-->7. Probably a concessive participle,<br>
 <B>{though being able to be in a position of weight}</B> <b><i>(either in<br>
 matter of finance or of dignity, or a burden on your funds or<br>
 "men of weight" as Moffatt suggests)</i></b>. Milligan suggests that Paul<br>
 "plays here on the double sense of the phrase" like the Latin<br>
 proverb: _Honos propter onus_. So he adds, including Silas and<br>
 Timothy, <B>{as Christ's apostles}</B>, as missionaries clearly, whether<br>
 in the technical sense or not <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ac 14:4,14; 2Co 8:23; 11:13;<br>
 Ro 16:7; Php 2:25; Re 2:2)</i></b>. They were entitled to pay as<br>
 "Christ's apostles" <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1Co 9; 2Co 11:7ff.)</i></b>, though they had<br>
 not asked for it.<br>
 <br>
 2:7 <B>{But we were gentle in the midst of you}</B> <b><i>(\alla egen&#275;th&#275;men<br>
 n&#275;pioi en mes&#333;i hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Note \egen&#275;th&#275;men\ <b><i>(became)</i></b>, not<br>
 \&#275;metha\ <b><i>(were)</i></b>. This rendering follows \&#275;pioi\ instead of<br>
 \n&#275;pioi\ <b><i>(Aleph B D C Vulg. Boh.)</i></b> which is clearly correct,<br>
 though Dibelius, Moffatt, Ellicott, Weiss prefer \&#275;pioi\ as<br>
 making better sense. Dibelius terms \n&#275;pioi\ _unmoglich_<br>
 <b><i>(impossible)</i></b>, but surely that is too strong. Paul is fond of the<br>
 word \n&#275;pioi\ <b><i>(babes)</i></b>. Lightfoot admits that he here works the<br>
 metaphor to the limit in his passion, but does not mar it as<br>
 Ellicott holds. <B>{As when a nurse cherishes her own children}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\h&#333;s ean trophos thalp&#275;i ta heaut&#275;s tekna\)</i></b>. This comparative<br>
 clause with \h&#333;s ean\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 4:26; Ga 6:10 without \ean\ or \an\)</i></b><br>
 and the subjunctive <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 968)</i></b> has a sudden<br>
 change of the metaphor, as is common with Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 5:24; 2Co<br>
 3:13ff.)</i></b> from <B>{babes}</B> to <B>{nurse}</B> <b><i>(\trophos\)</i></b>, old word, here<br>
 only in the N.T., from \treph&#333;\, to nourish, \troph&#275;\,<br>
 nourishment. It is really the mother-nurse "who suckles and<br>
 nurses her own children" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>, a use found in Sophocles,<br>
 and a picture of Paul's tender affection for the Thessalonians.<br>
 \Thalp&#333;\ is an old word to keep warm, to cherish with tender<br>
 love, to foster. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->Eph 5:29.<br>
 <br>
 2:8 <B>{Even so, being affectionately desirous of you}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s<br>
 omeiromenoi hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Clearly the correct text rather than<br>
 \himeiromenoi\ from \himeir&#333;\, old verb to long for. But the verb<br>
 \homeiromai\ <b><i>(Westcott and Hort _om_., smooth breathing)</i></b> occurs<br>
 nowhere else except MSS. in <!-#-->Job 3:21; Ps 62:2 <b><i>(Symmachus)</i></b> and<br>
 the Lycaonian sepulchral inscription <b><i>(4th cent. A.D.)</i></b> about the<br>
 sorrowing parents \homeiromenoi peri paidos\, <B>{greatly desiring<br>
 their son}</B> <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan, _Vocabulary_)</i></b>. Moulton suggests<br>
 that it comes from a root \smer\, remember, and that \o-\ is a<br>
 derelict preposition \o\ like \o-duromai, o-kell&#333;, &#333;-keanos\.<br>
 Wohlenberg <b><i>(Zahn, _Kommentar_)</i></b> calls the word "a term of<br>
 endearment," "derived from the language of the nursery"<br>
 <b><i>(Milligan)</i></b>. <B>{We were well pleased}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;udokoumen\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active of \eudoke&#333;\, common verb in later Greek and in N.T. <b><i>(see<br>
 on <!-#-->Mt 3:17)</i></b>, picturing Paul's idea of their attitude while in<br>
 Thessalonica. Paul often has it with the infinitive as here. <B>{To<br>
 impart}</B> <b><i>(\metadounai\)</i></b>. Second aorist active infinitive of<br>
 \metadid&#333;mi\, old verb to share with <b><i>(see on <!-#-->Lu 3:11)</i></b>. Possible<br>
 zeugma with <B>{souls}</B> <b><i>(\psuchas\)</i></b>, though Lightfoot renders<br>
 "lives." Paul and his associates held nothing back. <B>{Because ye<br>
 were become very dear to us}</B> <b><i>(\dioti agap&#275;toi h&#275;min egen&#275;th&#275;te\)</i></b>.<br>
 Note \dioti\ <b><i>(double cause, \dia, hoti\, for that)</i></b>, use of<br>
 \ginomai\ again for become, and dative \h&#275;min\ with verbal<br>
 \agap&#275;toi\, beloved and so dear. A beautiful picture of the<br>
 growth of Paul's affection for them as should be true with every<br>
 pastor.<br>
 <br>
 2:9 <B>{Travail}</B> <b><i>(\mochthon\)</i></b>. Old word for difficult labour, harder<br>
 than \kopos\ <b><i>(toil)</i></b>. In the N.T. only here, <!-#-->2Th 3:8; 2Co 11:27.<br>
 Note accusative case here though genitive with \mn&#275;moneu&#333;\ in<br>
 <!-#-->1:3. <B>{Night and day}</B> <b><i>(\nuktos kai h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. Genitive case,<br>
 both by day and by night, perhaps beginning before dawn and<br>
 working after dark. So in <!-#-->3:10. <B>{That we might not burden any<br>
 of you}</B> <b><i>(\pros to m&#275; epibar&#275;sai tina hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Use of \pros\ with<br>
 the articular infinitive to express purpose <b><i>(only four times by<br>
 Paul)</i></b>. The verb \epibare&#333;\ is late, but in the papyri and<br>
 inscriptions for laying a burden <b><i>(\baros\)</i></b> on <b><i>(\epi-\)</i></b> one. In<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->2Th 3:8; 2Co 2:5. Paul boasted of his<br>
 financial independence where he was misunderstood as in<br>
 Thessalonica and Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 9-12)</i></b>, though he vindicated his<br>
 right to remuneration. <B>{We preached}</B> <b><i>(\ek&#275;ruxamen\)</i></b>. <B>{We<br>
 heralded}</B> <b><i>(from \k&#275;rux\, herald)</i></b> to you, common verb for preach.<br>
 <br>
 2:10 <B>{How holily and righteously and unblameably}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s hosi&#333;s<br>
 kai dikai&#333;s kai amempt&#333;s\)</i></b>. Paul calls the Thessalonians and God<br>
 as witnesses <b><i>(\martures\)</i></b> to his life toward you the believers<br>
 <b><i>(\humin tois pisteuousin\)</i></b> dative of personal interest. He<br>
 employs three common adverbs that show how holily toward God and<br>
 how righteously toward men so that they did not blame him and his<br>
 associates in either respect. So there is a reason for each<br>
 adverb. All this argues that Paul spent a considerable time in<br>
 Thessalonica, more than the three sabbaths mentioned by Luke. The<br>
 pastor ought to live so that his life will bear close inspection.<br>
 <br>
 2:11 <B>{As a father with his own children}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s pat&#275;r tekna<br>
 heautou\)</i></b>. Change from the figure of the mother-nurse in verse<br>
 <!-#-->7. There is ellipse of a principal verb with the participles<br>
 \parakalountes, paramuthoumenoi, marturoumenoi\. Lightfoot<br>
 suggests \enouthetoumen\ <b><i>(we admonished)</i></b> or \egen&#275;th&#275;men\ <b><i>(we<br>
 became)</i></b>. The three participles give three phases of the<br>
 minister's preaching <b><i>(exhorting, encouraging or consoling,<br>
 witnessing or testifying)</i></b>. They are all old verbs, but only the<br>
 first <b><i>(\parakale&#333;\)</i></b> is common in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 2:12 <B>{To the end that}</B> <b><i>(\eis to\)</i></b>. Final use of \eis\ and the<br>
 articular infinitive, common idiom in the papyri and Paul uses<br>
 \eis\ to and the infinitive fifty times <b><i>(see again in <!-#-->3:2)</i></b>,<br>
 some final, some sub-final, some result <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_,<br>
 pp. 989-91)</i></b>. <B>{Walk worthily of God}</B> <b><i>(\peripatein axi&#333;s tou<br>
 theou\)</i></b>. Present infinitive <b><i>(linear action)</i></b>, and genitive case<br>
 with adverb \axi&#333;s\ as in <!-#-->Col 1:10 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Php 1:27; Eph 4:1)</i></b>,<br>
 like a preposition. <B>{Calleth}</B> <b><i>(\kalountos\)</i></b>. Present active<br>
 participle, keeps on calling. Some MSS. have \kalesantos\,<br>
 called. <B>{Kingdom}</B> <b><i>(\basileian\)</i></b> here is the future consummation<br>
 because of glory <b><i>(\doxan\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->2Th 1:5; 1Co 6:9; 15:50; Ga<br>
 5:21; 2Ti 4:1,18)</i></b>, but Paul uses it for the present kingdom of<br>
 grace also as in <!-#-->1Co 4:20; Ro 14:17; Col 1:13.<br>
 <br>
 2:13 <B>{And for this cause we also}</B> <b><i>(\kai dia touto kai h&#275;meis\)</i></b>.<br>
 Note \kai\ twice. We as well as you are grateful for the way the<br>
 gospel was received in Thessalonica. <B>{Without ceasing}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\adialeipt&#333;s\)</i></b>. Late adverb for which see on <!-#-->1:2 and for<br>
 \eucharistoumen\ see on &#175;1:2. <B>{The word of the message}</B> <b><i>(\logon<br>
 ako&#275;s\)</i></b>. Literally, <B>{the word of}</B> hearing, as in Sir. 42:1 and<br>
 <!-#-->Heb 4:2 \ho logos t&#275;s ako&#275;s\, the word marked by hearing<br>
 <b><i>(genitive case)</i></b>, the word which you heard. Here with \tou theou\<br>
 <b><i>(of God)</i></b> added as a second descriptive genitive which Paul<br>
 expands and justifies. <B>{Ye received it so}</B> <b><i>(\paralabontes\)</i></b> and<br>
 <B>{accepted or welcomed it}</B> <b><i>(\edexasthe\)</i></b> so, <B>{not as the word of<br>
 men}</B> <b><i>(\ou logou anthr&#333;p&#333;n\)</i></b>, <B>{but as the word of God}</B> <b><i>(\alla<br>
 logon theou\)</i></b>, <B>{as it is in truth}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s al&#275;th&#333;s estin\)</i></b>. This<br>
 last clause is literally, <B>{as it truly is}</B>. Paul had not a doubt<br>
 that he was proclaiming God's message. Should any preacher preach<br>
 his doubts if he has any? God's message can be found and Paul<br>
 found it. <B>{Worketh in you}</B> <b><i>(\energeitai en humin\)</i></b>. Perhaps<br>
 middle voice of \energe&#333;\ <b><i>(\en, ergon\, work)</i></b> late verb, not in<br>
 ancient Greek or LXX, but in papyri and late writers <b><i>(Polybius,<br>
 etc.)</i></b> and in N.T. only by Paul and James. If it is passive, as<br>
 Milligan thinks, it means "is set in operation," as Polybius has<br>
 it. The idea then is that the word of God is set in operation in<br>
 you that believe.<br>
 <br>
 2:14 <B>{Imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\mim&#275;tai t&#333;n ekkl&#275;si&#333;n tou theou t&#333;n ous&#333;n en t&#275;i Ioudai&#257;i\)</i></b>. On<br>
 \mim&#275;tai\ see on &#175;1:5. "This passage, implying an affectionate<br>
 admiration of the Jewish churches on the part of St. Paul, and<br>
 thus entirely bearing out the impression produced by the<br>
 narrative in the Acts, is entirely subversive of the theory<br>
 maintained by some and based on a misconception of <!-#-->Ga 2, and by<br>
 the fiction of the Pseudo-Clementines, of the feud existing<br>
 between St. Paul and the Twelve" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. <B>{In Christ Jesus}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\en Christ&#333;i I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. It takes this to make a _Christian_ church<br>
 of God. Note order here <B>{Christ Jesus}</B> as compared with <B>{Jesus<br>
 Christ}</B> in <!-#-->1:1,3. <B>{Ye also--even as they}</B> <b><i>(\kai humeis--kai<br>
 autoi\)</i></b>. Note \kai\ twice <b><i>(correlative use of \kai\)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Countrymen}</B> <b><i>(\sumphulet&#333;n\)</i></b>. Fellow-countrymen or tribesmen.<br>
 Late word that refers primarily to Gentiles who no doubt joined<br>
 the Jews in Thessalonica who instigated the attacks on Paul and<br>
 Silas so that it "was taken up by the native population, without<br>
 whose co-operation it would have been powerless" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Own}</B> <b><i>(\idi&#333;n\)</i></b> here has apparently a weakened force. Note \hupo\<br>
 here with the ablative both with \sumphulet&#333;n\ and \Ioudai&#333;n\<br>
 after the intransitive \epathete\ <b><i>(suffered)</i></b>. The persecution of<br>
 the Christians by the Jews in Judea was known everywhere.<br>
 <br>
 2:15 <B>{Who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n kai<br>
 ton Kurion apokteinant&#333;n I&#275;soun kai tous proph&#275;tas\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active participle of \apoktein&#333;\. Vivid justification of<br>
 his praise of the churches in Judea. The Jews killed the prophets<br>
 before the Lord Jesus who reminded them of their guilt <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 23:29)</i></b>. Paul, as Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 2:23)</i></b>, lays the guilt of the death<br>
 of Christ on the Jews. <B>{And drove us out}</B> <b><i>(\kai h&#275;m&#257;s<br>
 ekdi&#333;xant&#333;n\)</i></b>. An old verb to drive out or banish, to chase out<br>
 as if a wild beast. Only here in N.T. It is Paul's vivid<br>
 description of the scene told in <!-#-->Ac 17:5ff. when the rabbis and<br>
 the hoodlums from the agora chased him out of Thessalonica by the<br>
 help of the politarchs. <B>{Please not God}</B> <b><i>(\The&#333;i m&#275; areskont&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 The rabbis and Jews thought that they were pleasing God by so<br>
 doing as Paul did when he ravaged the young church in Jerusalem.<br>
 But Paul knows better now. <B>{And are contrary to all men}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 pasin anthr&#333;pois enanti&#333;n\)</i></b>. Dative case with the adjective<br>
 \enanti&#333;n\ <b><i>(old and common word, face to face, opposite)</i></b>. It<br>
 seems like a bitter word about Paul's countrymen whom he really<br>
 loved <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 9:1-5; 10:1-6)</i></b>, but Paul knew only too well the<br>
 middle wall of partition between Jew and Gentile as he shows in<br>
 <!-#-->Eph 2 and which only the Cross of Christ can break down.<br>
 Tacitus <b><i>(_Hist_. V. 5)</i></b> says that the Jews are _adversus omnes<br>
 alios hostile odium_.<br>
 <br>
 2:16 <B>{Forbidding us}</B> <b><i>(\k&#333;luont&#333;n h&#275;m&#257;s\)</i></b>. Explanatory participle<br>
 of the idea in \enanti&#333;n\. They show their hostility to Paul at<br>
 every turn. Right here in Corinth, where Paul is when he writes,<br>
 they had already shown venomous hostility toward Paul as Luke<br>
 makes plain <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:6ff.)</i></b>. They not simply oppose his work among<br>
 the Jews, but also to the Gentiles <b><i>(\ethnesi\, nations outside of<br>
 the Abrahamic covenant as they understood it)</i></b>. <B>{That they may be<br>
 saved}</B> <b><i>(\hina s&#333;th&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Final use of \hina\ with first aorist<br>
 passive subjunctive of \s&#333;z&#333;\ old verb to save. It was the only<br>
 hope of the Gentiles, Christ alone and not the mystery-religions<br>
 offered any real hope. <B>{To fill up their sins alway}</B> <b><i>(\eis to<br>
 anapl&#275;r&#333;sai aut&#333;n tas hamartias pantote\)</i></b>. Another example of<br>
 \eis to\ and the infinitive as in verse <!-#-->12. It may either be<br>
 God's conceived plan to allow the Jews to go on and fill up<br>
 <b><i>(\anapl&#275;r&#333;sai\, note \ana\, fill up full, old verb)</i></b> or it may be<br>
 the natural result from the continual <b><i>(\pantote\)</i></b> sins of the<br>
 Jews. <B>{Is come}</B> <b><i>(\ephthasen\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(timeless aorist)</i></b><br>
 active indicative of \phthan&#333;\ which no longer means to come<br>
 before as in <!-#-->1Th 4:15 where alone in the N.T. it retains the<br>
 old idea of coming before. Some MSS. have the perfect active<br>
 \ephthaken\, prophetic perfect of realization already. Frame<br>
 translates it: "But the wrath has come upon them at last." This<br>
 is the most likely meaning of \eis telos\. Paul vividly foresees<br>
 and foretells the final outcome of this attitude of hate on the<br>
 part of the Jews. _Tristis exitus_, Bengel calls it. Paul speaks<br>
 out of a sad experience.<br>
 <br>
 2:17 <B>{Being bereaved of you}</B> <b><i>(\aporphanisthentes aph' hum&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive participle of the rare compound verb<br>
 <b><i>(\aporphaniz&#333;\, in Aeschylus, but nowhere else in N.T.)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, <B>{being orphaned from you}</B> <b><i>(\aph' hum&#333;n\, ablative<br>
 case)</i></b>. Paul changes the figure again <b><i>(\trophos\ or mother nurse<br>
 in verse <!-#-->7, \n&#275;pios\ or babe in verse <!-#-->7, \pat&#275;r\ or father in<br>
 verse <!-#-->11)</i></b> to <B>{orphan}</B> <b><i>(\orphanos\)</i></b>. He refers to the period of<br>
 separation from them, <B>{for a short season}</B> <b><i>(\pros kairon h&#333;ras\)</i></b><br>
 for a season of an hour. This idiom only here in N.T., but \pros<br>
 kairon\ in <!-#-->Lu 8:13 and \pros h&#333;ran\ in <!-#-->2Co 7:8. But it has<br>
 seemed long to Paul. Precisely how long he had been gone we do<br>
 not know, some months at any rate. <B>{In presence, not in heart}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pros&#333;p&#333;i ou kardi&#257;i\)</i></b>. Locative case. \Pros&#333;pon\, old word<br>
 <b><i>(\pros, ops\, in front of the eye, face)</i></b> for face, look, person.<br>
 Literally, <B>{in face or person}</B>. His heart was with them, though<br>
 they no longer saw his face. Heart, originally \kardia\, is the<br>
 inner man, the seat of the affections and purposes, not always in<br>
 contrast with intellect <b><i>(\nous\)</i></b>. "Out of sight, not out of mind"<br>
 <b><i>(Rutherford)</i></b>. <B>{Endeavoured the more exceedingly}</B> <b><i>(\perissoter&#333;s<br>
 espoudasamen\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist active indicative of<br>
 \spoudaz&#333;\, old word to hasten <b><i>(from \spoud&#275;, speud&#333;\)</i></b>. <B>{We<br>
 became zealous}</B>. Comparative adverb \perissoter&#333;s\ from<br>
 \perisson\, more abundantly than before being orphaned from you.<br>
 <B>{Your face}</B> <b><i>(\to pros&#333;pon hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Cf. his <B>{face}</B> above. <B>{With<br>
 great desire}</B> <b><i>(\en poll&#275;i epithumi&#257;i\)</i></b>. <B>{In much longing}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epithumia\ from \epi\ and \thumos\, \epithume&#333;\, to run after,<br>
 to yearn after, whether good or bad)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:18 <B>{Because}</B> <b><i>(\dioti\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->2:8. <B>{We would fain have come<br>
 to you}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;thel&#275;samen elthein pros humas\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of \thel&#333;\. Literally, <B>{we desired to come to you. I<br>
 Paul}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; men Paulos\)</i></b>. Clear example of literary plural<br>
 \&#275;thelesamen\ with singular pronoun \eg&#333;\. Paul uses his own name<br>
 elsewhere also as in <!-#-->2Co 10:1; Ga 5:2; Col 1:23; Eph 3:1; Phm<br>
 1:19. <B>{Once and again}</B> <b><i>(\kai hapax kai dis\)</i></b>. <B>{Both once and<br>
 twice}</B> as in <!-#-->Php 4:16. Old idiom in Plato. <B>{And Satan hindered<br>
 us}</B> <b><i>(\kai enekopsen h&#275;mas ho Satanas\)</i></b>. Adversative use of \kai=\<br>
 but or and yet. First aorist active indicative of \enkopt&#333;\, late<br>
 word to cut in, to hinder. Milligan quotes papyrus example of<br>
 third century, B.C. Verb used to cut in a road, to make a road<br>
 impassable. So Paul charges Satan with cutting in on his path.<br>
 Used by Paul in <!-#-->Ac 24:4; Ga 5:7 and passive \enekoptom&#275;n\ in<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 15:22; 1Pe 3:7. This hindrance may have been illness,<br>
 opposition of the Jews in Corinth, what not.<br>
 <br>
 2:19 <B>{Crown of glorying}</B> <b><i>(\stephanos kauch&#275;se&#333;s\)</i></b>. When a king or<br>
 conqueror came on a visit he was given a chaplet of glorying.<br>
 Paul is answering the insinuation that he did not really wish to<br>
 come. <B>{At his coming}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i autou parousi&#257;i\)</i></b>. This word<br>
 \parousia\ is untechnical <b><i>(just _presence_ from \pareimi\)</i></b> in<br>
 <!-#-->2Th 2:9; 1Co 16:17; 2Co 7:6f.; 10:10; Php 1:26; 2:12. But here<br>
 <b><i>(also <!-#-->1Th 3:13; 4:15; 5:23; 2Th 2:1,8; 1Co 15:23)</i></b> we have the<br>
 technical sense of the second coming of Christ. Deissmann <b><i>(_Light<br>
 from the Ancient East_, pp. 372ff.)</i></b> notes that the word in the<br>
 papyri is almost technical for the arrival of a king or ruler who<br>
 expects to receive his "crown of coming." The Thessalonians, Paul<br>
 says, will be his crown, glory, joy when Jesus comes.<br>
