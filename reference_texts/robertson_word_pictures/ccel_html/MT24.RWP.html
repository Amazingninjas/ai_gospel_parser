<p>24:1 <B>{Went out from the temple}</B> <b><i>(\exelth&#333;n apo tou hierou\)</i></b>. All<br>
 the discourses since <!-#-->Mt 21:23 have been in the temple courts<br>
 <b><i>(\hieron\, the sacred enclosure)</i></b>. But now Jesus leaves it for<br>
 good after the powerful denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees<br>
 in chapter 23. His public teaching is over. It was a tragic<br>
 moment. As he was going out <b><i>(\eporeueto\, descriptive imperfect)</i></b><br>
 the disciples, as if to relieve the thought of the Master came to<br>
 him <b><i>(\pros&#275;lthon\)</i></b> to show <b><i>(\epideixai\, ingressive aorist<br>
 infinitive)</i></b> the buildings of the temple <b><i>(\tas oikodomas tou<br>
 hierou\)</i></b>. They were familiar to Jesus and the disciples, but<br>
 beautiful like a snow mountain <b><i>(Josephus, _Wars_ V,5,6)</i></b>, the<br>
 monument that Herod the Great had begun and that was not yet<br>
 complete <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 2:20)</i></b>. Great stones were there of polished<br>
 marble.<br>
 <br>
 24:2 <B>{One stone upon another}</B> <b><i>(\lithos epi lithon\)</i></b>. Stone upon<br>
 stone. A startling prediction showing that the gloomy current of<br>
 the thoughts of Jesus were not changed by their words of<br>
 admiration for the temple.<br>
 <br>
 24:3 <B>{As he sat}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#275;menou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute. Picture of<br>
 Jesus sitting on the Mount of Olives looking down on Jerusalem<br>
 and the temple which he had just left. After the climb up the<br>
 mountain four of the disciples <b><i>(Peter, James, John, Andrew)</i></b> come<br>
 to Jesus with the problem raised by his solemn words. They ask<br>
 these questions about the destruction of Jerusalem and the<br>
 temple, his own second coming <b><i>(\parousia\, presence, common in<br>
 the papyri for the visit of the emperor)</i></b>, and the end of the<br>
 world. Did they think that they were all to take place<br>
 simultaneously? There is no way to answer. At any rate Jesus<br>
 treats all three in this great eschatological discourse, the most<br>
 difficult problem in the Synoptic Gospels. Many theories are<br>
 advanced that impugn the knowledge of Jesus or of the writers or<br>
 of both. It is sufficient for our purpose to think of Jesus as<br>
 using the destruction of the temple and of Jerusalem which did<br>
 happen in that generation in A.D. 70, as also a symbol of his own<br>
 second coming and of the end of the world <b><i>(\sunteleias tou<br>
 ai&#333;nos\)</i></b> or consummation of the age. In a painting the artist by<br>
 skilful perspective may give on the same surface the inside of a<br>
 room, the fields outside the window, and the sky far beyond.<br>
 Certainly in this discourse Jesus blends in apocalyptic language<br>
 the background of his death on the cross, the coming destruction<br>
 of Jerusalem, his own second coming and the end of the world. He<br>
 now touches one, now the other. It is not easy for us to separate<br>
 clearly the various items. It is enough if we get the picture as<br>
 a whole as it is here drawn with its lessons of warning to be<br>
 ready for his coming and the end. The destruction of Jerusalem<br>
 came as he foretold. There are some who would date the Synoptic<br>
 Gospels after A.D. 70 in order to avoid the predictive element<br>
 involved in the earlier date. But that is to limit the<br>
 fore-knowledge of Jesus to a merely human basis. The word<br>
 \parousia\ occurs in this chapter alone <b><i>(<!-#-->3,27,37,39)</i></b> in the<br>
 Gospels, but often in the Epistles, either of presence as opposed<br>
 to absence <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 2:12)</i></b> or the second coming of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th<br>
 2:1)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:4 <B>{Lead you astray}</B> <b><i>(\h&#8211;m&#257;s plan&#275;s&#275;i\)</i></b>. This warning runs all<br>
 through the discourse. It is amazing how successful deceivers<br>
 have been through the ages with their eschatological programs.<br>
 The word in the passive appears in <!-#-->18:12 when the one sheep<br>
 wanders astray. Here it is the active voice with the causative<br>
 sense to lead astray. Our word planet comes from this root.<br>
 <br>
 24:5 <B>{In my name}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#333;i onomati mou\)</i></b>. They will arrogate to<br>
 themselves false claims of Messiahship in <b><i>(on the basis of)</i></b> the<br>
 name of Christ himself. Josephus <b><i>(_Wars_ VI, 54)</i></b> gives there<br>
 false Christs as one of the reasons for the explosion against<br>
 Rome that led to the city's destruction. Each new hero was<br>
 welcomed by the masses including Barcochba. "I am the Messiah,"<br>
 each would say. Forty odd years ago two men in Illinois claimed<br>
 to be Messiah, each with followers <b><i>(Schlatter, Schweinfurth)</i></b>. In<br>
 more recent years Mrs. Annie Besant has introduced a theosophical<br>
 Messiah and Mrs. Eddy made claims about herself on a par with<br>
 those of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 24:6 <B>{See that ye be not troubled}</B> <b><i>(\horate m&#275; throeisthe\)</i></b>.<br>
 Asyndeton here with these two imperatives as <!-#-->Mr 8:15 \orate<br>
 blepete\ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 949)</i></b>. Look out for the wars<br>
 and rumours of wars, but do not be scared out of your wits by<br>
 them. \Throe&#333;\ means to cry aloud, to scream, and in the passive<br>
 to be terrified by an outcry. Paul uses this very verb <b><i>(\m&#275;de<br>
 throeisthai\)</i></b> in <!-#-->2Th 2:2 as a warning against excitement over<br>
 false reports that he had predicted the immediate second coming<br>
 of Christ. <B>{But the end is not yet}</B> <b><i>(\all' oup&#333; estin to telos\)</i></b>.<br>
 It is curious how people overlook these words of Jesus and<br>
 proceed to set dates for the immediate end. That happened during<br>
 the Great War and it has happened since.<br>
 <br>
 24:8 <B>{The beginning of travail}</B> <b><i>(\arch&#275; odin&#333;n\)</i></b>. The word means<br>
 birth-pangs and the Jews used the very phrase for the sufferings<br>
 of the Messiah which were to come before the coming of the<br>
 Messiah <b><i>(Book of Jubilees, 23:18; Apoc. of Baruch 27-29)</i></b>. But the<br>
 word occurs with no idea of birth as the pains of death <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps<br>
 18:5; Ac 2:24)</i></b>. These woes, says Jesus, are not a proof of the<br>
 end, but of the beginning.<br>
 <br>
 24:9 <B>{Ye shall be hated}</B> <b><i>(\esesthe misoumenoi\)</i></b>. Periphrastic<br>
 future passive to emphasize the continuous process of the linear<br>
 action. For tribulation <b><i>(\thlipsin\ see <!-#-->13:21)</i></b>, a word common<br>
 in the Acts, Epistles, and Apocalypse for the oppression<br>
 <b><i>(pressure)</i></b> that the Christians received. <B>{For my name's sake}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dia to onoma mou\)</i></b>. The most glorious name in the world today,<br>
 but soon to be a byword of shame <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 5:41)</i></b>. The disciples would<br>
 count it an honour to be dishonoured for the Name's sake.<br>
 <br>
 24:11 <B>{False prophets}</B> <b><i>(\pseudoproph&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Jesus had warned<br>
 against them in the Sermon on the Mount <b><i>(<!-#-->7:15)</i></b>. They are still<br>
 coming.<br>
 <br>
 24:12 <B>{Shall wax cold}</B> <b><i>(\psug&#275;setai\)</i></b>. Second future passive<br>
 indicative from \psuch&#333;\. To breathe cool by blowing, to grow<br>
 cold, "spiritual energy blighted or chilled by a malign or<br>
 poisonous wind" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. <B>{The love of many}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; agap&#275; t&#333;n<br>
 poll&#333;n\)</i></b>. Love of the brotherhood gives way to mutual hatred and<br>
 suspicion.<br>
 <br>
 24:14 <B>{Shall be preached}</B> <b><i>(\keruchth&#275;setai\)</i></b>. Heralded in all the<br>
 inhabited world. \En hol&#275;i t&#275;i oikoumen&#275;i\ supply \g&#275;i\. It is<br>
 not here said that all will be saved nor must this language be<br>
 given too literal and detailed an application to every<br>
 individual.<br>
 <br>
 24:15 <B>{The abomination of desolation}</B> <b><i>(\to bdelugma t&#275;s<br>
 erem&#333;se&#333;s\)</i></b>. An allusion to <!-#-->Da 9:27; 11:31; 12:11. Antiochus<br>
 Epiphanes erected an altar to Zeus on the altar of Jehovah<br>
 <b><i>(1Macc. 1:54,59; 6:7; 2Macc. 6:1-5)</i></b>. The desolation in the mind<br>
 of Jesus is apparently the Roman army <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 21:20)</i></b> in the temple,<br>
 an application of the words of Daniel to this dread event. The<br>
 verb \bdelussomai\ is to feel nausea because of stench, to abhor,<br>
 to detest. Idolatry was a stench to God <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 16:15; Re 17:4)</i></b>.<br>
 Josephus tells us that the Romans burned the temple and offered<br>
 sacrifices to their ensigns placed by the eastern gate when they<br>
 proclaimed Titus as Emperor.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Let him that readeth understand}</B> <b><i>(\ho anaginosk&#333;n noeit&#333;\)</i></b>. This<br>
 parenthesis occurs also in <!-#-->Mr 13:14. It is not to be supposed<br>
 that Jesus used these words. They were inserted by Mark as he<br>
 wrote his book and he was followed by Matthew.<br>
 <br>
 24:16 <B>{Flee unto the mountains}</B> <b><i>(\pheuget&#333;san eis ta or&#275;\)</i></b>. The<br>
 mountains east of the Jordan. Eusebius <b><i>(_H.E._ iii,5,3)</i></b> says that<br>
 the Christians actually fled to Pella at the foot of the<br>
 mountains about seventeen miles south of the Sea of Galilee. They<br>
 remembered the warning of Jesus and fled for safety.<br>
 <br>
 24:17 <B>{On the housetop}</B> <b><i>(\epi tou d&#333;matos\)</i></b>. They could escape<br>
 from roof to roof and so escape, "the road of the roofs," as the<br>
 rabbis called it. There was need for haste.<br>
 <br>
 24:18 <B>{In the field}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i agr&#333;i\)</i></b>. The peasant worked in his<br>
 time and left his mantle at home then as now.<br>
 <br>
 24:20 <B>{In winter nor on a sabbath}</B> <b><i>(\cheim&#333;nos\, genitive of<br>
 time, \m&#275;de sabbat&#333;i\, locative of time)</i></b>. In winter because of<br>
 the rough weather. On a sabbath because some would hesitate to<br>
 make such a journey on the sabbath. Josephus in his _Wars_ gives<br>
 the best illustration of the horrors foretold by Jesus in verse<br>
 <!-#-->21.<br>
 <br>
 24:22 <B>{Had been shortened}</B> <b><i>(\ekolob&#333;th&#275;san\)</i></b>. From \kolobos\,<br>
 lopped, mutilated, as the hands, the feet. It is a second-class<br>
 condition, determined as unfulfilled. It is a prophetic figure,<br>
 the future regarded as past. <B>{For the elect's sake}</B> <b><i>(\dia tous<br>
 eklektous\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mt 22:14 for another use of this phrase by<br>
 Jesus and also <!-#-->24:31. The siege was shortened by various<br>
 historical events like the stopping of the strengthening of the<br>
 walls by Herod Agrippa by orders from the Emperor, the sudden<br>
 arrival of Titus, the neglect of the Jews to prepare for a long<br>
 siege. "Titus himself confessed that God was against the Jews,<br>
 since otherwise neither his armies nor his engines would have<br>
 availed against their defences" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:23 <B>{Lo, here is the Christ, or here}</B> <b><i>(\idou h&#333;de ho Christos &#275;<br>
 h&#333;de\)</i></b>. The false prophets <b><i>(<!-#-->24:11)</i></b> create the trouble and now<br>
 false Christs <b><i>(\pseudo-Christoi\, verse <!-#-->24)</i></b> offer a way out of<br>
 these troubles. The deluded victims raise the cries of "Lo,<br>
 here," when these false Messiahs arise with their panaceas for<br>
 public ills <b><i>(political, religious, moral, and spiritual)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:24 <B>{Great signs and wonders}</B> <b><i>(\s&#275;meia megala kai terata\)</i></b>. Two<br>
 of the three words so often used in the N.T. about the works<br>
 <b><i>(\erga\)</i></b> of Jesus, the other being \dunameis\ <b><i>(powers)</i></b>. They<br>
 often occur together of the same work <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 4:48; Ac 2:22; 4:30;<br>
 2Co 12:12; Heb 2:4)</i></b>. \Teras\ is a wonder or prodigy, \dunamis\,<br>
 a mighty work or power, \s&#275;meion\, a sign of God's purpose.<br>
 Miracle <b><i>(\miraculum\)</i></b> presents only the notion of wonder or<br>
 portent. The same deed can be looked at from these different<br>
 angles. But the point to note here is that mere "signs and<br>
 wonders" do not of themselves prove the power of God. These<br>
 charlatans will be so skilful that they will, <B>{if possible}</B> <b><i>(\ei<br>
 dunaton\)</i></b>, lead astray the very elect. The implication is that it<br>
 is not possible. People become excited and are misled and are<br>
 unable to judge of results. Often it is _post hoc, sed non<br>
 propter hoc_. Patent-medicine men make full use of the credulity<br>
 of people along this line as do spiritualistic mediums.<br>
 Sleight-of-hand men can deceive the unwary.<br>
 <br>
 24:26 <B>{In the wilderness}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i er&#275;m&#333;i\)</i></b>. Like Simon son of<br>
 Gioras <b><i>(Josephus, _War_, IV,9,5,&7)</i></b>. <B>{In the inner chambers}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 tois tameiois\)</i></b>. Like John of Giscala <b><i>(Josephus, _War_, V,6,1)</i></b>.<br>
 False Messiahs act the role of the Great Unseen and Unknown.<br>
 <br>
 24:27 <B>{As seen}</B> <b><i>(\phainetai\)</i></b>. Visible in contrast to the<br>
 invisibility of the false Messiahs. Cf. <!-#-->Re 1:7. Like a flash of<br>
 lightning.<br>
 <br>
 24:28 <B>{Carcase}</B> <b><i>(\pt&#333;ma\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->14:12, the corpse. Originally<br>
 a fallen body from \pipt&#333;\, to fall, like Latin _cadaver_ from<br>
 _cado_, to fall. The proverb here as in <!-#-->Lu 17:37, is like that<br>
 in <!-#-->Job 39:30; Pr 30:17. <B>{Eagles}</B> <b><i>(\aetoi\)</i></b>. Perhaps the griffon<br>
 vulture, larger than the eagle, which <b><i>(Aristotle)</i></b> was often seen<br>
 in the wake of an army and followed Napoleon's retreat from<br>
 Russia.<br>
 <br>
 24:29 <B>{Immediately}</B> <b><i>(\euthe&#333;s\)</i></b>. This word, common in Mark's<br>
 Gospel as \euthus\, gives trouble if one stresses the time<br>
 element. The problem is how much time intervenes between "the<br>
 tribulation of those days" and the vivid symbolism of verse <!-#-->29.<br>
 The use of \en tachei\ in <!-#-->Re 1:1 should make one pause before<br>
 he decides. Here we have a prophetic panorama like that with<br>
 foreshortened perspective. The apocalyptic pictures in verse <!-#-->29<br>
 also call for sobriety of judgment. One may compare Joel's<br>
 prophecy as interpreted by Peter in <!-#-->Ac 21:16-22. Literalism is<br>
 not appropriate in this apocalyptic eschatology.<br>
 <br>
 24:30 <B>{The sign of the Son of Man in heaven}</B> <b><i>(\to s&#275;meion tou<br>
 huiou tou anthr&#333;pou en ouran&#333;i\)</i></b>. Many theories have been<br>
 suggested like the cross in the sky, etc. Bruce sees a reference<br>
 to <!-#-->Da 7:13 "one like the Son of man" and holds that Christ<br>
 himself is the sign in question <b><i>(the genitive of apposition)</i></b>.<br>
 This is certainly possible. It is confirmed by the rest of the<br>
 verse: "They shall see the Son of man coming." See <!-#-->Mt 16:27;<br>
 26:64. The Jews had repeatedly asked for such a sign <b><i>(Broadus)</i></b><br>
 as in <!-#-->Mt 12:38; 16:1; Joh 2:18.<br>
 <br>
 24:31 <B>{With a great sound of a trumpet}</B> <b><i>(\meta salpiggos ph&#333;n&#275;s<br>
 megal&#275;s\)</i></b>. Some MSS. omit <b><i>(\ph&#333;n&#275;s\)</i></b> "sound." The trumpet was the<br>
 signal employed to call the hosts of Israel to march as to war<br>
 and is common in prophetic imagery <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 27:13)</i></b>. Cf. the seventh<br>
 angel <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 11:15)</i></b>. Clearly "the coming of the son of man is not<br>
 to be identified with the judgment of Jerusalem but rather forms<br>
 its preternatural background" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:32 <B>{Putteth forth its leaves}</B> <b><i>(\ta phulla ekphu&#275;i\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 active subjunctive according to Westcott and Hort. If accented<br>
 \ekphu&#275;i\ <b><i>(last syllable)</i></b>, it is second aorist passive<br>
 subjunctive <b><i>(Erasmus)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:34 <B>{This generation}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; genea haut&#275;\)</i></b>. The problem is<br>
 whether Jesus is here referring to the destruction of Jerusalem<br>
 or to the second coming and end of the world. If to the<br>
 destruction of Jerusalem, there was a literal fulfilment. In the<br>
 Old Testament a generation was reckoned as forty years. This is<br>
 the natural way to take verse <!-#-->34 as of <!-#-->33 <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>, "all<br>
 things" meaning the same in both verses.<br>
 <br>
 24:36 <B>{Not even the Son}</B> <b><i>(\oude ho huios\)</i></b>. Probably genuine,<br>
 though absent in some ancient MSS. The idea is really involved in<br>
 the words "but the Father only" <b><i>(\ei m&#275; ho pat&#275;r monos\)</i></b>. It is<br>
 equally clear that in this verse Jesus has in mind the time of<br>
 his second coming. He had plainly stated in verse <!-#-->34 that those<br>
 events <b><i>(destruction of Jerusalem)</i></b> would take place in that<br>
 generation. He now as pointedly states that no one but the Father<br>
 knows the day or the hour when these things <b><i>(the second coming<br>
 and the end of the world)</i></b> will come to pass. One may, of course,<br>
 accuse Jesus of hopeless confusion or extend his confession of<br>
 ignorance of the date of the second coming to the whole chain of<br>
 events. So McNeile: "It is impossible to escape the conclusion<br>
 that Jesus as Man, expected the End, within the lifetime of his<br>
 contemporaries." And that after his explicit denial that he knew<br>
 anything of the kind! It is just as easy to attribute ignorance<br>
 to modern scholars with their various theories as to Jesus who<br>
 admits his ignorance of the date, but not of the character of the<br>
 coming.<br>
 <br>
 24:37 <B>{The days of Noah}</B> <b><i>(\hai h&#275;merai tou N&#333;e\)</i></b>. Jesus had used<br>
 this same imagery before to the Pharisees <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 17:26-30)</i></b>. In<br>
 Noah's day there was plenty of warning, but utter unpreparedness.<br>
 Most people are either indifferent about the second coming or<br>
 have fanciful schemes or programs about it. Few are really eager<br>
 and expectant and leave to God the time and the plans.<br>
 <br>
 24:38 <B>{Were eating}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san tr&#333;gontes\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect.<br>
 The verb means to chew raw vegetables or fruits like nuts or<br>
 almonds.<br>
 <br>
 24:41 <B>{At the mill}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i mul&#333;i\)</i></b>. So Westcott and Hort and<br>
 not \mul&#333;ni\ <b><i>(millhouse)</i></b> Textus Receptus. The millstone and then<br>
 hand-mill which was turned by two women <b><i>(\al&#275;thousai\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Ex<br>
 11:5. This verb is a late form for \ale&#333;\. There was a handle<br>
 near the edge of the upper stone.<br>
 <br>
 24:42 <B>{Watch therefore}</B> <b><i>(\gr&#275;g&#333;reite oun\)</i></b>. A late present<br>
 imperative from the second perfect \egr&#275;gora\ from \egeir&#333;\. Keep<br>
 awake, be on the watch "therefore" because of the uncertainty of<br>
 the time of the second coming. Jesus gives a half dozen parables<br>
 to enforce the point of this exhortation <b><i>(the Porter, the Master<br>
 of the House, the Faithful Servant and the Evil Servants, the Ten<br>
 Virgins, the Talents, the Sheep and the Goats)</i></b>. Matthew does not<br>
 give the Parable of the Porter <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 13:35-37)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:43 <B>{In what watch}</B> <b><i>(\poi&#257;i phulak&#275;i\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->14:25 <b><i>(four<br>
 watches of the night)</i></b>. <B>{Broken through}</B> <b><i>(\dioruchth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. Digged<br>
 through the tile roof or under the floor <b><i>(dirt in the poorer<br>
 houses)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:44 <B>{That ye think not}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;i ou dokeite h&#333;r&#257;i\)</i></b>. It is useless<br>
 to set the day and hour for Christ's coming. It is folly to<br>
 neglect it. This figure of the thief will be used also by Paul<br>
 concerning the unexpectedness of Christ's second coming <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th<br>
 5:2)</i></b>. See also <!-#-->Mt 24:50 for the unexpectedness of the coming<br>
 with punishment for the evil servant.<br>
 <br>
 24:48 <B>{My lord tarrieth}</B> <b><i>(\chronizei mou ho kurios\)</i></b>. That is the<br>
 temptation and to give way to indulge in fleshly appetites or to<br>
 pride of superior intellect. Within a generation scoffers will be<br>
 asking where is the promise of the coming of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->2Pe 3:4)</i></b>.<br>
 They will forget that God's clock is not like our clock and that<br>
 a day with the Lord may be a thousand years or a thousand years<br>
 as one day <b><i>(<!-#-->2Pe 3:8)</i></b>.<br>
