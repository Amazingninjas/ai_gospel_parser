<p>5:1 <B>{If--be dissolved}</B> <b><i>(\ean--kataluth&#275;i\)</i></b>. Third class<br>
 condition, \ean\ and first aorist passive subjunctive. The very<br>
 word used <b><i>(\katalu&#333;\)</i></b> for striking down a tent. <B>{The earthly<br>
 house of our tabernacle}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; epigeios h&#275;m&#333;n oikia tou sk&#275;nous\)</i></b>.<br>
 Rather, "If our earthly <b><i>(see on &#175;1Co 15:40 for \epigeios\)</i></b> house<br>
 of the tent <b><i>(\sk&#275;nos\, another form of \sk&#275;n&#275;\, tent, from root<br>
 \ska\, to cover)</i></b>." Appositive genitive, the house <b><i>(\oikia\)</i></b> is<br>
 the tent. <B>{We have}</B> <b><i>(\echomen\)</i></b>. Present indicative. We possess<br>
 the title to it now by faith. "Faith is the title-deed<br>
 <b><i>(\hupostasis\)</i></b> to things hoped for" <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 11:7)</i></b>. <B>{A building<br>
 from God}</B> <b><i>(\oikodom&#275;n ek theou\)</i></b>. This \oikodom&#275;\ <b><i>(found in<br>
 Aristotle, Plutarch, LXX, etc., and papyri, though condemned by<br>
 Atticists)</i></b> is more substantial than the \sk&#275;nos\. <B>{Not made with<br>
 hands}</B> <b><i>(\acheiropoi&#275;ton\)</i></b>. Found first in <!-#-->Mr 14:58 in charge<br>
 against Jesus before the Sanhedrin <b><i>(both the common verbal<br>
 \cheiropoi&#275;ton\ and the newly made vernacular \acheiropoi&#275;ton\,<br>
 same verbal with \a\ privative)</i></b>. Elsewhere only here and <!-#-->Col<br>
 2:11. Spiritual, eternal home.<br>
 <br>
 5:2 <B>{To be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\to oik&#275;t&#275;rion h&#275;m&#333;n to ex ouranou ependusasthai\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 middle infinitive of late verb \ependu&#333;\, double compound <b><i>(\ep,<br>
 en\)</i></b> to put upon oneself. Cf. \ependut&#275;s\ for a fisherman's linen<br>
 blouse or upper garment <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 21:7)</i></b>. \Oik&#275;t&#275;rion\ is old word<br>
 used here of the spiritual body as the abode of the spirit. It is<br>
 a mixed metaphor <b><i>(putting on as garment the dwelling-place)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:3 <B>{Being clothed}</B> <b><i>(\endusamenoi\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 participle, having put on the garment. <B>{Naked}</B> <b><i>(\gumnoi\)</i></b>. That<br>
 is, disembodied spirits, "like the souls in Sheol, without form,<br>
 and void of all power of activity" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:4 <B>{Not for that we would be unclothed}</B> <b><i>(\eph' h&#333;i ou thelomen<br>
 ekdusasthai\)</i></b>. Rather, "For that <b><i>(\eph' h&#333;i\)</i></b> we do not wish to<br>
 put off the clothing, but to put it on" <b><i>(\all' ependusasthai\)</i></b>.<br>
 The transposition of the negative \ou\ weakens the sense. Paul<br>
 does not wish to be a mere disembodied spirit without his<br>
 spiritual garment. <B>{That what is mortal may be swallowed up of<br>
 life}</B> <b><i>(\hina katapoth&#275;i to thn&#275;ton hupo t&#275;s z&#333;&#275;s\)</i></b>. "Only what is<br>
 mortal perishes; the personality, consisting of soul and body,<br>
 survives," <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. See on &#175;1:22 for "the earnest of the<br>
 spirit."<br>
 <br>
 5:6 <B>{At home in the body}</B> <b><i>(\end&#275;mountes en t&#333;i s&#333;mati\)</i></b>. Rare<br>
 verb \end&#275;me&#333;\ from \end&#275;mos\ <b><i>(one among his own people as<br>
 opposed to \ekd&#275;mos\, one away from home)</i></b>. Both \ekd&#275;me&#333;\ <b><i>(more<br>
 common in the old Greek)</i></b> and \end&#275;me&#333;\ occur in the papyri with<br>
 the contrast made by Paul here.<br>
 <br>
 5:7 <B>{By sight}</B> <b><i>(\dia eidous\)</i></b>. Rather, by appearance.<br>
 <br>
 5:8 <B>{We are of good courage}</B> <b><i>(\tharroumen\)</i></b>. Good word for cheer<br>
 and same root as \tharse&#333;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 9:2,22)</i></b>. Cheer up. <B>{Are willing<br>
 rather}</B> <b><i>(\eudokoumen\)</i></b>. Rather, "We are well-pleased, we prefer"<br>
 if left to ourselves. Cf. <!-#-->Php 1:21f. Same \eudoke&#333;\ used in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 3:22. <B>{To be at home with the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\end&#275;m&#275;sai pros ton<br>
 Kurion\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active infinitive, to attain<br>
 that goal is bliss for Paul.<br>
 <br>
 5:9 <B>{We make it our aim}</B> <b><i>(\philotimoumetha\)</i></b>. Old and common<br>
 verb, present middle, from \philotimos\ <b><i>(\philos, tim&#275;\, fond of<br>
 honour)</i></b>, to act from love of honour, to be ambitious in the good<br>
 sense <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 4:11; 2Co 5:9; Ro 15:20)</i></b>. The Latin _ambitio_ has a<br>
 bad sense from _ambire_, to go both ways to gain one's point. <B>{To<br>
 be well-pleasing to him}</B> <b><i>(\euarestoi aut&#333;i einai\)</i></b>. Late<br>
 adjective that shows Paul's loyalty to Christ, his Captain. Found<br>
 in several inscriptions in the _Koin&#275;_ period <b><i>(Deissmann, _Bible<br>
 Studies_, p. 214; Moulton and Milligan's _Vocabulary_)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:10 <B>{Before the judgment-seat of Christ}</B> <b><i>(\emprosthen tou<br>
 b&#275;matos tou Christou\)</i></b>. Old word \b&#275;ma\, a step <b><i>(from \bain&#333;\)</i></b>, a<br>
 platform, the seat of the judge <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:19)</i></b>. Christ is Saviour,<br>
 Lord, and Judge of us all <b><i>(\tous pantas\, the all)</i></b>. <B>{That each<br>
 may receive}</B> <b><i>(\hina komis&#275;tai hekastos\)</i></b>. Receive as his due,<br>
 \komiz&#333;\ means, old verb. See on &#175;Mt 25:27. <B>{Bad}</B> <b><i>(\phaulon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Old word, akin to German _faul_, worthless, of no account, base,<br>
 wicked.<br>
 <br>
 5:11 <B>{The fear of the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\ton phobon tou Kuriou\)</i></b>. Many today<br>
 regard this a played-out motive, but not so Paul. He has in mind<br>
 verse <!-#-->10 with the picture of the judgment seat of Christ. <B>{We<br>
 persuade}</B> <b><i>(\peithomen\)</i></b>. Conative present active, we try to<br>
 persuade. It is always hard work. <B>{Unto God}</B> <b><i>(\the&#333;i\)</i></b>. Dative<br>
 case. God understands whether men do or not. <B>{That we are made<br>
 manifest}</B> <b><i>(\pephaner&#333;sthai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive infinitive of<br>
 \phanero&#333;\ in indirect discourse after \elpiz&#333;\. Stand<br>
 manifested, state of completion.<br>
 <br>
 5:12 <B>{As giving you occasion of glorying}</B> <b><i>(\aphorm&#275;n didontes<br>
 humin kauch&#275;matos\)</i></b>. An old Greek word <b><i>(\apo, horm&#275;\, onset,<br>
 rush)</i></b>, a base of operations, material with which to glory, as we<br>
 say "a tip" only much more. <B>{That ye may have wherewith to<br>
 answer}</B> <b><i>(\hina ech&#275;te pros\)</i></b>. Literally, "That ye may have<br>
 something against <b><i>(for facing those, etc.)</i></b>." Paul wishes his<br>
 champions in Corinth to know the facts. <B>{In appearance, and not<br>
 in heart}</B> <b><i>(\en pros&#333;p&#333;i kai m&#275; en kardi&#257;i\)</i></b>. He means the<br>
 Judaizers who were braggarts about their orthodox Judaism.<br>
 <br>
 5:13 <B>{Whether we are beside ourselves}</B> <b><i>(\eite exest&#275;men\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active indicative of \exist&#275;mi\, old verb, here to stand<br>
 out of oneself <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b> from \ekstasis\, ecstasy, comes as<br>
 in <!-#-->Mr 5:42. It is literary plural, for Paul is referring only<br>
 to himself. See on &#175;1:6 for \eite--eite\. It is a condition of<br>
 the first class and Paul assumes as true the charge that he was<br>
 crazy <b><i>(if I was crazy)</i></b> for the sake of argument. Festus made it<br>
 later <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 26:24)</i></b>. He spoke with tongues <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 14:18)</i></b> and had<br>
 visions <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 12:1-6)</i></b> which probably the Judaizers used against<br>
 him. A like charge was made against Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 3:21)</i></b>. People<br>
 often accuse those whom they dislike with being a bit off.<br>
 <br>
 5:14 <B>{The love of Christ}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; agap&#275; tou Christou\)</i></b>. Subjective<br>
 genitive, Christ's love for Paul as shown by verse <!-#-->15.<br>
 <B>{Constraineth us}</B> <b><i>(\sunechei h&#275;mas\)</i></b>. Old and common verb, to<br>
 hold together, to press the ears together <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 7:57)</i></b>, to press<br>
 on every side <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:45)</i></b>, to hold fast <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:63)</i></b>, to hold<br>
 oneself to <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:5)</i></b>, to be pressed <b><i>(passive, <!-#-->Lu 12:50; Php<br>
 1:23)</i></b>. So here Paul's conception of Christ's love for him holds<br>
 him together to his task whatever men think or say. <B>{Judging<br>
 this}</B> <b><i>(\krinantas touto\)</i></b>. Having reached this conclusion, ever<br>
 since his conversion <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 1:17f.)</i></b>. <B>{One died for all}</B> <b><i>(\heis<br>
 huper pant&#333;n apethanen\)</i></b>. This is the central tenet in Paul's<br>
 theology and Christology. \Huper\ <b><i>(over)</i></b> here is used in the<br>
 sense of substitution as in <!-#-->Joh 11:50; Ga 3:13, death in behalf<br>
 so that the rest will not have to die. This use of \huper\ is<br>
 common in the papyri <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 631)</i></b>. In fact,<br>
 \huper\ in this sense is more usual in Greek than \anti, pro\ or<br>
 any other preposition. <B>{Therefore all died}</B> <b><i>(\ara hoi pantes<br>
 apethanon\)</i></b>. Logical conclusion <b><i>(\ara\, corresponding)</i></b>, the one<br>
 died for the all and so the all died when he did, all the<br>
 spiritual death possible for those for whom Christ died. This is<br>
 Paul's gospel, clear-cut, our hope today.<br>
 <br>
 5:15 <B>{Should no longer live unto themselves}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275;keti<br>
 heautois z&#333;sin\)</i></b>. The high doctrine of Christ's atoning death<br>
 carries a correspondingly high obligation on the part of those<br>
 who live because of him. Selfishness is ruled out by our duty to<br>
 live "unto him who for their sakes died and rose again."<br>
 <br>
 5:16 <B>{Henceforth}</B> <b><i>(\apo tou nun\)</i></b>. From the time that we gained<br>
 this view of Christ's death for us. <B>{After the flesh}</B> <b><i>(\kata<br>
 sarka\)</i></b>. According to the flesh, the fleshy way of looking at<br>
 men. He, of course, knows men "in the flesh <b><i>(\en t&#275;i sarki\)</i></b>, but<br>
 Paul is not speaking of that. Worldly standards and distinctions<br>
 of race, class, cut no figure now with Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 3:28)</i></b> as he<br>
 looks at men from the standpoint of the Cross of Christ. <B>{Even<br>
 though we have known Christ after the flesh}</B> <b><i>(\ei kai egn&#333;kamen<br>
 kata sarka Christon\)</i></b>. Concessive clause <b><i>(\ei kai\, if even or<br>
 also)</i></b> with perfect active indicative. Paul admits that he had<br>
 once looked at Christ \kata sarka\, but now no longer does it.<br>
 Obviously he uses \kata sarka\ in precisely the same sense that<br>
 he did in verse <!-#-->15 about men. He had before his conversion<br>
 known Christ \kata sarka\, according to the standards of the men<br>
 of his time, the Sanhedrin and other Jewish leaders. He had led<br>
 the persecution against Jesus till Jesus challenged and stopped<br>
 him <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 9:4)</i></b>. That event turned Paul clean round and he no<br>
 longer knows Christ in the old way \kata sarka\. Paul may or may<br>
 not have seen Jesus in the flesh before his death, but he says<br>
 absolutely nothing on that point here.<br>
 <br>
 5:17 <B>{A new creature}</B> <b><i>(\kain&#275; ktisis\)</i></b>. A fresh start is made<br>
 <b><i>(\kain&#275;\)</i></b>. \Ktisis\ is the old word for the act of creating <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro<br>
 1:20)</i></b>, but in N.T. by metonymy it usually bears the notion of<br>
 \ktisma\, the thing created or creature as here. <B>{The old things<br>
 are passed away}</B> <b><i>(\ta archaia par&#275;lthen\)</i></b>. Did pass by, he means.<br>
 Second aorist active of \parerchomai\, to go by. The ancient<br>
 <b><i>(\archaia\)</i></b> way of looking at Christ among other things. And yet<br>
 today there are scholars who are trying to revive the old<br>
 prejudiced view of Jesus Christ as a mere man, a prophet, to give<br>
 us "a reduced Christ." That was once Paul's view, but it passed<br>
 by forever for him. It is a false view and leaves us no gospel<br>
 and no Saviour. <B>{Behold, they are become new}</B> <b><i>(\idou, gegone<br>
 kaina\)</i></b>. Perfect active indicative of \ginomai\, have become new<br>
 <b><i>(fresh, \kaina\)</i></b> to stay so.<br>
 <br>
 5:18 <B>{Who reconciled us to himself through Christ}</B> <b><i>(\tou<br>
 katallaxantos h&#275;mas heaut&#333;i dia Christou\)</i></b>. Here Paul uses one of<br>
 his great doctrinal words, \katallass&#333;\, old word for exchanging<br>
 coins. \Diallass&#333;\, to change one's mind, to reconcile, occurs in<br>
 N.T. only in <!-#-->Mt 5:24 though in papyri <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light from<br>
 the Ancient East_, p. 187)</i></b>, and common in Attic. \Katallass&#333;\ is<br>
 old verb, but more frequent in later writers. We find<br>
 \sunallass&#333;\ in <!-#-->Ac 7:26 and \apokatallass&#333;\ in <!-#-->Col 1:20f.; Eph<br>
 2:16 and the substantive \katallag&#275;\ in <!-#-->Ro 5:11; 11:15 as well<br>
 as here. It is hard to discuss this great theme without apparent<br>
 contradiction. God's love <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 3:16)</i></b> provided the means and<br>
 basis for man's reconciliation to God against whom he had sinned.<br>
 It is all God's plan because of his love, but God's own sense of<br>
 justice had to be satisfied <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 3:26)</i></b> and so God gave his Son<br>
 as a propitiation for our sins <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 3:25; Col 1:20; 1Jo 2:2;<br>
 4:10)</i></b>. The point made by Paul here is that God needs no<br>
 reconciliation, but is engaged in the great business of<br>
 reconciling us to himself. This has to be done on God's terms and<br>
 is made possible through <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> Christ. <B>{And gave unto us the<br>
 ministry of reconciliation}</B> <b><i>(\kai dontos h&#275;min t&#275;n diakonian t&#275;s<br>
 katallag&#275;s\)</i></b>. It is a ministry marked by reconciliation, that<br>
 consists in reconciliation. God has made possible through Christ<br>
 our reconciliation to him, but in each case it has to be made<br>
 effective by the attitude of each individual. The task of winning<br>
 the unreconciled to God is committed to us. It is a high and holy<br>
 one, but supremely difficult, because the offending party <b><i>(the<br>
 guilty)</i></b> is the hardest to win over. We must be loyal to God and<br>
 yet win sinful men to him.<br>
 <br>
 5:19 <B>{To wit, that}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s hoti\)</i></b>. Latin puts it _quoniam quidem_.<br>
 It is an unclassical idiom, but occurs in the papyri and<br>
 inscriptions <b><i>(Moulton, _Prol_., p. 212; Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 1033)</i></b>. It is in <!-#-->Es 4:14. See also <!-#-->2Co 11:21; 2Th 2:2. It<br>
 probably means "how that." <B>{Not reckoning}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; logizomenos\)</i></b>.<br>
 What Jesus did <b><i>(his death for us)</i></b> stands to our credit <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro<br>
 8:32)</i></b> if we make our peace with God. This is our task, "the word<br>
 of reconciliation," that we may receive "the righteousness of<br>
 God" and be adopted into the family of God.<br>
 <br>
 5:20 <B>{We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ}</B> <b><i>(\huper<br>
 Christou oun presbeuomen\)</i></b>. Old word from \presbus\, an old man,<br>
 first to be an old man, then to be an ambassador <b><i>(here and <!-#-->Eph<br>
 6:20 with \en halus&#275;i\ in a chain added)</i></b>, common in both senses<br>
 in the Greek. "The proper term in the Greek East for the<br>
 Emperor's Legate" <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient East_, p.<br>
 374)</i></b>, in inscriptions and papyri. So Paul has a natural pride in<br>
 using this dignified term for himself and all ministers. The<br>
 ambassador has to be _persona grata_ with both countries <b><i>(the one<br>
 that he represents and the one to which he goes)</i></b>. Paul was<br>
 Christ's _Legate_ to act in his behalf and in his stead. <B>{As<br>
 though God were intreating by us}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s tou theou parakalountos<br>
 di' h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute with \h&#333;s\ used with the<br>
 participle as often to give the reason <b><i>(apparent or real)</i></b>. Here<br>
 God speaks through Christ's Legate. <B>{Be ye reconciled to God}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katallag&#275;te t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive imperative of<br>
 \katallass&#333;\ and used with the dative case. "Get reconciled to<br>
 God," and do it now. This is the ambassador's message as he bears<br>
 it to men from God.<br>
 <br>
 5:21 <B>{Him who knew no sin}</B> <b><i>(\ton m&#275; gnonta hamartian\)</i></b>. Definite<br>
 claim by Paul that Jesus did not commit sin, had no personal<br>
 acquaintance <b><i>(\m&#275; gnonta\, second aorist active participle of<br>
 \gin&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b> with it. Jesus made this claim for himself <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 8:46)</i></b>. This statement occurs also in <!-#-->1Pe 2:22; Heb 4:15; 7:26;<br>
 1Jo 3:5. Christ was and is "a moral miracle" <b><i>(Bernard)</i></b> and so<br>
 more than mere man. <B>{He made to be sin}</B> <b><i>(\hamartian epoi&#275;sen\)</i></b>.<br>
 The words "to be" are not in the Greek. "Sin" here is the<br>
 substantive, not the verb. God "treated as sin" the one "who knew<br>
 no sin." But he knew the contradiction of sinners <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 12:3)</i></b>.<br>
 We may not dare to probe too far into the mystery of Christ's<br>
 suffering on the Cross, but this fact throws some light on the<br>
 tragic cry of Jesus just before he died: "My God, My God, why<br>
 didst thou forsake me?" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:46)</i></b>. <B>{That we might become}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hina h&#275;meis gen&#333;metha\)</i></b>. Note "become." This is God's purpose<br>
 <b><i>(\hina\)</i></b> in what he did and in what Christ did. Thus alone can we<br>
 obtain God's righteousness <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:17)</i></b>.<br>
