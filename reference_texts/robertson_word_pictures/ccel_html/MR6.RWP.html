<p>6:1 <B>{Into his own country}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n patrida autou\)</i></b>. So <!-#-->Mt<br>
 13:54. There is no real reason for identifying this visit to<br>
 Nazareth with that recorded in <!-#-->Lu 4:26-31 at the beginning of<br>
 the Galilean Ministry. He was rejected both times, but it is not<br>
 incongruous that Jesus should give Nazareth a second chance. It<br>
 was only natural for Jesus to visit his mother, brothers, and<br>
 sisters again. Neither Mark nor Matthew mention Nazareth here by<br>
 name, but it is plain that by \patrida\ the region of Nazareth is<br>
 meant. He had not lived in Bethlehem since his birth.<br>
 <br>
 6:2 <B>{Began to teach}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rxato didaskein\)</i></b>. As was now his custom<br>
 in the synagogue on the sabbath. The ruler of the synagogue<br>
 <b><i>(\archisunag&#333;gos\, see <!-#-->Mt 5:22)</i></b> would ask some one to speak<br>
 whensoever he wished. The reputation of Jesus all over Galilee<br>
 opened the door for him. Jesus may have gone to Nazareth for<br>
 rest, but could not resist this opportunity for service. <B>{Whence<br>
 hath this man these things?}</B> <b><i>(\Pothen tout&#333;i tauta;\)</i></b>. Laconic<br>
 and curt, <B>{Whence these things to this fellow?}</B> With a sting and<br>
 a fling in their words as the sequel shows. They continued to be<br>
 amazed <b><i>(\exepl&#275;ssonto\, imperfect tense passive)</i></b>. They challenge<br>
 both the apparent <B>{wisdom}</B> <b><i>(\sophia\)</i></b> with which he spoke and<br>
 <B>{the mighty works}</B> or powers <b><i>(\hai dunameis\)</i></b> <B>{such as those}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\toiautai\)</i></b> <B>{coming to pass}</B> <b><i>(\ginomenai\, present middle<br>
 participle, repeatedly wrought)</i></b> <B>{by his hands}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#333;n<br>
 cheir&#333;n\)</i></b>. They felt that there was some hocus-pocus about it<br>
 somehow and somewhere. They do not deny the wisdom of his words,<br>
 nor the wonder of his works, but the townsmen knew Jesus and they<br>
 had never suspected that he possessed such gifts and graces.<br>
 <br>
 6:3 <B>{Is not this the carpenter?}</B> <b><i>(\Ouch houtos estin ho<br>
 tekt&#333;n;\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 13:55 calls him "the carpenter's son" <b><i>(\ho tou<br>
 tektonos huios\)</i></b>. He was both. Evidently since Joseph's death he<br>
 had carried on the business and was "the carpenter" of Nazareth.<br>
 The word \tekt&#333;n\ comes from \tekein, tikt&#333;\, to beget, create,<br>
 like \techn&#275;\ <b><i>(craft, art)</i></b>. It is a very old word, from Homer<br>
 down. It was originally applied to the worker in wood or builder<br>
 with wood like our carpenter. Then it was used of any artisan or<br>
 craftsman in metal, or in stone as well as in wood and even of<br>
 sculpture. It is certain that Jesus worked in wood. Justin Martyr<br>
 speaks of ploughs, yokes, et cetera, made by Jesus. He may also<br>
 have worked in stone and may even have helped build some of the<br>
 stone synagogues in Galilee like that in Capernaum. But in<br>
 Nazareth the people knew him, his family <b><i>(no mention of Joseph)</i></b>,<br>
 and his trade and discounted all that they now saw with their own<br>
 eyes and heard with their own ears. This word carpenter "throws<br>
 the only flash which falls on the continuous tenor of the first<br>
 thirty years from infancy to manhood, of the life of Christ"<br>
 <b><i>(Farrar)</i></b>. That is an exaggeration for we have <!-#-->Lu 2:41-50 and<br>
 "as his custom was" <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 4:16)</i></b>, to go no further. But we are<br>
 grateful for Mark's realistic use of \tekt&#333;n\ here. <B>{And they<br>
 were offended in him}</B> <b><i>(\kai eskandalizonto en aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. So exactly<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 13:56, <B>{were made to stumble in him}</B>, trapped like game by<br>
 the \skandalon\ because they could not explain him, having been<br>
 so recently one of them. "The Nazarenes found their stumbling<br>
 block in the person or circumstances of Jesus. He became--\petra<br>
 skandalou\ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 2:7,8; Ro 9:33)</i></b> to those who disbelieved"<br>
 <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. Both Mark and <!-#-->Mt 13:57, which see, preserve the retort<br>
 of Jesus with the quotation of the current proverb about a<br>
 prophet's lack of honour in his own country. <!-#-->Joh 4:44 quoted it<br>
 from Jesus on his return to Galilee long before this. It is to be<br>
 noted that Jesus here makes a definite claim to being a prophet<br>
 <b><i>(\proph&#275;t&#275;s\, forspeaker for God)</i></b>, a seer. He was much more than<br>
 this as he had already claimed to be Messiah <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 4:26; Lu<br>
 4:21)</i></b>, the Son of man with power of God <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:10; Mt 9:6; Lu<br>
 5:24)</i></b>, the Son of God <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 5:22)</i></b>. They stumble at Jesus today<br>
 as the townspeople of Nazareth did. <B>{In his own house}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i<br>
 oiki&#257;i autou\)</i></b>. Also in <!-#-->Mt 13:57. This was the saddest part of<br>
 it all, that his own brothers in his own home disbelieved his<br>
 Messianic claims <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 7:5)</i></b>. This puzzle was the greatest of<br>
 all.<br>
 <br>
 6:6 <B>{And he marvelled because of their unbelief}</B> <b><i>(\kai ethaumasen<br>
 dia t&#275;n apistian aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Aorist tense, but Westcott and Hort put<br>
 the imperfect in the margin. Jesus had divine knowledge and<br>
 accurate insight into the human heart, but he had human<br>
 limitations in certain things that are not clear to us. He<br>
 marvelled at the faith of the Roman centurion where one would not<br>
 expect faith <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 8:10; Lu 7:9)</i></b>. Here he marvels at the lack of<br>
 faith where he had a right to expect it, not merely among the<br>
 Jews, but in his own home town, among his kinspeople, even in his<br>
 own home. One may excuse Mary, the mother of Jesus, from this<br>
 unbelief, puzzled, as she probably was, by his recent conduct<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 3:21,31)</i></b>. There is no proof that she ever lost faith in her<br>
 wonderful Son. <B>{He went round about the villages teaching}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\peri&#275;gen t&#257;s k&#333;mas kukl&#333;i didask&#333;n\)</i></b>. A good illustration of<br>
 the frequent poor verse division. An entirely new paragraph<br>
 begins with these words, the third tour of Galilee. They should<br>
 certainly be placed with verse <!-#-->7. The Revised Version would be<br>
 justified if it had done nothing else than give us paragraphs<br>
 according to the sense and connection. "Jesus resumes the role of<br>
 a wandering preacher in Galilee" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Imperfect tense,<br>
 \peri&#275;gen\.<br>
 <br>
 6:7 <B>{By two and two}</B> <b><i>(\duo duo\)</i></b>. This repetition of the numeral<br>
 instead of the use of \ana duo\ or \kata duo\ is usually called a<br>
 Hebraism. The Hebrew does have this idiom, but it appears in<br>
 Aeschylus and Sophocles, in the vernacular _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(Oxyrhynchus<br>
 Papyri No. 121)</i></b>, in Byzantine Greek, and in modern Greek<br>
 <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient East_, pp. 122f.)</i></b>. Mark<br>
 preserves the vernacular _Koin&#275;_ better than the other Gospels<br>
 and this detail suits his vivid style. The six pairs of apostles<br>
 could thus cover Galilee in six different directions. Mark notes<br>
 that he "began to send them forth" <b><i>(\&#275;rxato autous apostellein\)</i></b>.<br>
 Aorist tense and present infinitive. This may refer simply to<br>
 this particular occasion in Mark's picturesque way. But the<br>
 imperfect tense \edidou\ means he kept on giving them all through<br>
 the tour, a continuous power <b><i>(authority)</i></b> over unclean spirits<br>
 singled out by Mark as representing "all manner of diseases and<br>
 all manner of sickness" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:1)</i></b>, "to cure diseases"<br>
 <b><i>(\iasthai\, <!-#-->Lu 9:1)</i></b>, healing power. They were to preach and to<br>
 heal <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:1; Mt 10:7)</i></b>. Mark does not mention preaching as a<br>
 definite part of the commission to the twelve on this their first<br>
 preaching tour, but he does state that they did preach <b><i>(<!-#-->6:12)</i></b>.<br>
 They were to be missioners or missionaries <b><i>(\apostellein\)</i></b> in<br>
 harmony with their office <b><i>(\apostoloi\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:8 <B>{Save a staff only}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275; rabdon monon\)</i></b>. Every traveller<br>
 and pilgrim carried his staff. Bruce thinks that Mark has here<br>
 preserved the meaning of Jesus more clearly than <!-#-->Mt 10:10 <b><i>(nor<br>
 staff)</i></b> and <!-#-->Lu 9:3 <b><i>(neither staff)</i></b>. This discrepancy has given<br>
 trouble to commentators. Grotius suggests no second staff for<br>
 Matthew and Luke. Swete considers that Matthew and Luke report<br>
 "an early exaggeration of the sternness of the command." "Without<br>
 even a staff is the _ne plus ultra_ of austere simplicity, and<br>
 self-denial. Men who carry out the spirit of these precepts will<br>
 not labour in vain" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:9 <B>{Shod with sandals}</B> <b><i>(\hupodedemenous sandalia\)</i></b>. Perfect<br>
 passive participle in the accusative case as if with the<br>
 infinitive \poreuesthai\ or \poreuth&#275;nai\, <b><i>(to go)</i></b>. Note the<br>
 aorist infinitive middle, \endusasthai\ <b><i>(text of Westcott and<br>
 Hort)</i></b>, but \endus&#275;sthe\ <b><i>(aorist middle subjunctive)</i></b> in the<br>
 margin. Change from indirect to direct discourse common enough,<br>
 not necessarily due to "disjointed notes on which the Evangelist<br>
 depended" <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 10:10 has "nor shoes" <b><i>(\m&#275;de<br>
 hupod&#275;mata\)</i></b>, possibly preserving the distinction between "shoes"<br>
 and "sandals" <b><i>(worn by women in Greece and by men in the east,<br>
 especially in travelling)</i></b>. But here again extra shoes may be the<br>
 prohibition. See on &#175;Mt 10:10 for this. <B>{Two coats}</B> <b><i>(\duo<br>
 chit&#333;nas\)</i></b>. Two was a sign of comparative wealth <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. The<br>
 mention of "two" here in all three Gospels probably helps us to<br>
 understand that the same thing applies to shoes and staff. "In<br>
 general, these directions are against luxury in equipment, and<br>
 also against their providing themselves with what they could<br>
 procure from the hospitality of others" <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:10 <B>{There abide}</B> <b><i>(\ekei menete\)</i></b>. So also <!-#-->Mt 10:11; Lu 9:4.<br>
 Only Matthew has city or village <b><i>(<!-#-->10:11)</i></b>, but he mentions house<br>
 in verse <!-#-->12. They were to avoid a restless and dissatisfied<br>
 manner and to take pains in choosing a home. It is not a<br>
 prohibition against accepting invitations.<br>
 <br>
 6:11 <B>{For a testimony unto them}</B> <b><i>(\eis marturion autois\)</i></b>. Not in<br>
 Matthew. <!-#-->Lu 9:5 has "for a testimony against them" <b><i>(\eis<br>
 marturion epi autous\)</i></b>. The dative \autois\ in Mark is the dative<br>
 of disadvantage and really carries the same idea as \epi\ in<br>
 Luke. The dramatic figure of <B>{shaking out}</B> <b><i>(\ektinaxate\,<br>
 effective aorist imperative, Mark and Matthew)</i></b>, <B>{shaking off}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\apotinassete\, present imperative, Luke)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:12 <B>{Preached that men should repent}</B> <b><i>(\ek&#275;ruxan hina<br>
 metano&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Constative aorist <b><i>(\ek&#275;ruxan\)</i></b>, summary<br>
 description. This was the message of the Baptist <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 3:2)</i></b> and<br>
 of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:15)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:13 <B>{They cast out many demons and they anointed with oil}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\exeballon kai &#275;leiphon elai&#333;i\)</i></b>. Imperfect tenses, continued<br>
 repetition. Alone in Mark. This is the only example in the N.T.<br>
 of \aleiph&#333; elai&#333;i\ used in connection with healing save in <!-#-->Jas<br>
 5:14. In both cases it is possible that the use of oil <b><i>(olive<br>
 oil)</i></b> as a medicine is the basis of the practice. See <!-#-->Lu 10:34<br>
 for pouring oil and wine upon the wounds. It was the best<br>
 medicine of the ancients and was used internally and externally.<br>
 It was employed often after bathing. The papyri give a number of<br>
 examples of it. The only problem is whether \aleiph&#333;\ in Mark and<br>
 James is used wholly in a ritualistic and ceremonial sense or<br>
 partly as medicine and partly as a symbol of divine healing. The<br>
 very word \aleiph&#333;\ can be translated rub or anoint without any<br>
 ceremony. "Traces of a ritual use of the unction of the sick<br>
 appear first among Gnostic practices of the second century"<br>
 <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. We have today, as in the first century, God and<br>
 medicine. God through nature does the real healing when we use<br>
 medicine and the doctor.<br>
 <br>
 6:14 <B>{Heard}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kousen\)</i></b>. This tour of Galilee by the disciples<br>
 in pairs wakened all Galilee, for the name of Jesus thus became<br>
 known <b><i>(\phaneron\)</i></b> or known till even Herod heard of it in the<br>
 palace. "A palace is late in hearing spiritual news" <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Therefore do these powers work in him}</B> <b><i>(\dia touto energousin<br>
 hai dunameis en aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. "A snatch of Herod's theology and<br>
 philosophy" <b><i>(Morison)</i></b>. John wrought no miracles <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 10:41)</i></b>,<br>
 but if he had risen from the dead perhaps he could. So Herod may<br>
 have argued. "Herod's superstition and his guilty conscience<br>
 raised this ghost to plague him" <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>. Our word _energy_ is<br>
 this same Greek word here used <b><i>(\energousin\)</i></b>. It means at work.<br>
 Miraculous powers were at work in Jesus whatever the explanation.<br>
 This all agreed, but they differed widely as to his personality,<br>
 whether Elijah or another of the prophets or John the Baptist.<br>
 Herod was at first much perplexed <b><i>(\di&#275;porei\, <!-#-->Lu 9:7 and <!-#-->Mr<br>
 6:20)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:16 <B>{John, whom I beheaded}</B> <b><i>(\hon ego apekephalisa I&#333;an&#275;n\)</i></b>. His<br>
 fears got the best of him and so Herod settled down on this<br>
 nightmare. He could still see that charger containing John's head<br>
 coming towards him in his dreams. The late verb \apokephaliz&#333;\<br>
 means to cut off the head. Herod had ordered it done and<br>
 recognizes his guilt.<br>
 <br>
 6:17 <B>{For Herod himself}</B> <b><i>(\Autos gar ho H&#275;r&#333;id&#275;s\)</i></b>. Mark now<br>
 proceeds to give the narrative of the death of John the Baptist<br>
 some while before these nervous fears of Herod. But this _post<br>
 eventum_ narrative is very little out of the chronological order.<br>
 The news of John's death at Machaerus may even have come at the<br>
 close of the Galilean tour. "The tidings of the murder of the<br>
 Baptist seem to have brought the recent circuit to an end"<br>
 <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. The disciples of John "went and told Jesus. Now when<br>
 Jesus heard it, he withdrew from thence in a boat" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 14:12f.)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 14:3-12 for the discussion about Herod<br>
 Antipas and John and Herodias.<br>
 <br>
 6:18 <B>{Thy brother's wife}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n gunaika tou adelphou\)</i></b>. While the<br>
 brother was alive <b><i>(<!-#-->Le 18:16; 20:21)</i></b>. After a brother's death it<br>
 was often a duty to marry his widow.<br>
 <br>
 6:19 <B>{And Herodias set herself against him}</B> <b><i>(\H&#275; de H&#275;r&#333;idias<br>
 eneichen aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Dative of disadvantage. Literally, <B>{had it in<br>
 for him}</B>. This is modern slang, but is in exact accord with this<br>
 piece of vernacular _Koin&#275;_. No object of \eichen\ is expressed,<br>
 though \org&#275;n\ or \cholon\ may be implied. The tense is imperfect<br>
 and aptly described the feelings of Herodias towards this upstart<br>
 prophet of the wilderness who had dared to denounce her private<br>
 relations with Herod Antipas. Gould suggests that she "kept her<br>
 eye on him" or kept up her hostility towards him. She never let<br>
 up, but bided her time which, she felt sure, would come. See the<br>
 same idiom in <!-#-->Ge 49:23. She <B>{desired to kill him}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;thelen<br>
 auton apokteinai\)</i></b>. Imperfect again. <B>{And she could not}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 ouk &#275;dunato\)</i></b>. \Kai\ here has an adversative sense, but she could<br>
 not. That is, not yet. "The power was wanting, not the will"<br>
 <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:20 <B>{Feared John}</B> <b><i>(\ephobeito ton I&#333;an&#275;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense,<br>
 continual state of fear. He feared John and also Herodias.<br>
 Between the two Herod vacillated. He knew him to be righteous and<br>
 holy <b><i>(\dikaion kai hagion\)</i></b> and so innocent of any wrong. So he<br>
 <B>{kept him safe}</B> <b><i>(\sunet&#275;rei\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense again. Late Greek<br>
 verb. From the plots and schemes of Herodias. She was another<br>
 Jezebel towards John and with Herod. <B>{Much perplexed}</B> <b><i>(\polla<br>
 &#275;porei\)</i></b>. This the correct text not \polla epoiei\, did many<br>
 things. Imperfect tense again. <B>{He heard him gladly}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;de&#333;s<br>
 &#275;kouen\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense again. This is the way that Herod<br>
 really felt when he could slip away from the meshes of Herodias.<br>
 These interviews with the Baptist down in the prison at Machaerus<br>
 during his occasional visits there braced "his jaded mind as with<br>
 a whiff of fresh air" <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. But then he saw Herodias again and<br>
 he was at his wits' end <b><i>(\&#275;porei\, lose one's way, \a\ privative<br>
 and \poros\, way)</i></b>, for he knew that he had to live with Herodias<br>
 with whom he was hopelessly entangled.<br>
 <br>
 6:21 <B>{When a convenient day was come}</B> <b><i>(\genomen&#275;s h&#275;meras<br>
 eukairou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute. A day well appointed \eu\, well,<br>
 \kairos\, time)</i></b> for the purpose, the day for which she had long<br>
 waited. She had her plans all laid to spring a trap for her<br>
 husband Herod Antipas and to make him do her will with the<br>
 Baptist. Herod was not to know that he was the mere catspaw of<br>
 Herodias till it was all over. See on &#175;Mt 14:6 for discussion of<br>
 Herod's birthday <b><i>(\genesiois\, locative case or associative<br>
 instrumental of time)</i></b>. <B>{Made a supper}</B> <b><i>(\deipnon epoi&#275;sen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Banquet. <B>{To his lords}</B> <b><i>(\tois megist&#257;sin autou\)</i></b>. From<br>
 \megistan\ <b><i>(that from \megas\, great)</i></b>, common in the LXX and<br>
 later Greek. Cf. <!-#-->Re 6:15; 18:23. In the papyri. The grandees,<br>
 magnates, nobles, the chief men of civil life. <B>{The high<br>
 captains}</B> <b><i>(\tois chiliarchois\)</i></b>. Military tribunes, commanders of<br>
 a thousand men. <B>{The chief men of Galilee}</B> <b><i>(\tois pr&#333;tois t&#275;s<br>
 Galilaias\)</i></b>. The first men of social importance and prominence. A<br>
 notable gathering that included these three groups at the banquet<br>
 on Herod's birthday.<br>
 <br>
 6:22 <B>{The daughter of Herodias herself}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;s thugatros aut&#275;s<br>
 H&#275;r&#333;idiados\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again. Some ancient manuscripts<br>
 read \autou\ <b><i>(his, referring to Herod Antipas. So Westcott and<br>
 Hort)</i></b> instead of \aut&#275;s\ <b><i>(herself)</i></b>. In that case the daughter of<br>
 Herodias would also have the name Herodias as well as Salome, the<br>
 name commonly given her. That is quite possible in itself. It was<br>
 toward the close of the banquet, when all had partaken freely of<br>
 the wine, that Herodias made her daughter come in and dance<br>
 <b><i>(\eiselthous&#275;s kai orch&#275;samen&#275;s\)</i></b> in the midst <b><i>(Matthew)</i></b>. "Such<br>
 dancing was an almost unprecedented thing for women of rank, or<br>
 even respectability. It was mimetic and licentious, and performed<br>
 by professionals" <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>. Herodias stooped thus low to degrade<br>
 her own daughter like a common \hetaira\ in order to carry out<br>
 her set purpose against John. <B>{She pleased Herod and them that<br>
 sat at meat}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;resen H&#275;r&#333;id&#275;i kai tois sunanakeimenois\)</i></b>. The<br>
 maudlin group lounging on the divans were thrilled by the<br>
 licentious dance of the half-naked princess. <B>{Whatsoever thou<br>
 wilt}</B> <b><i>(\ho ean thel&#275;is\)</i></b> The drunken Tetrarch had been caught in<br>
 the net of Herodias. It was a public promise.<br>
 <br>
 6:23 <B>{And he sware unto her}</B> <b><i>(\kai &#333;mosen aut&#275;i\)</i></b>. The girl was<br>
 of marriageable age though called \korasion\ <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Es 2:9)</i></b>.<br>
 Salome was afterward married to Philip the Tetrarch. The<br>
 swaggering oath to the half of the kingdom reminds one of <!-#-->Es<br>
 5:3f., the same oath made to Esther by Ahasuerus.<br>
 <br>
 6:24 <B>{What shall I ask?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti ait&#275;s&#333;mai;\)</i></b>. The fact that she<br>
 went and spoke to her mother proves that she had not been told<br>
 beforehand what to ask. <!-#-->Mt 14:8 does not necessarily mean that,<br>
 but he simply condenses the account. The girl's question implies<br>
 by the middle voice that she is thinking of something for<br>
 herself. She was no doubt unprepared for her mother's ghastly<br>
 reply.<br>
 <br>
 6:25 <B>{Straightway with haste}</B> <b><i>(\euthus meta spoud&#275;s\)</i></b>. Before the<br>
 king's rash mood passed and while he was still under the spell of<br>
 the dancing princess. Herodias knew her game well. See on &#175;Mt<br>
 14:8f.<br>
 <br>
 6:26 <B>{He would not reject her}</B> <b><i>(\ouk &#275;thel&#275;sen athet&#275;sai aut&#275;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 He was caught once again between his conscience and his<br>
 environment. Like many since his day the environment stifled his<br>
 conscience.<br>
 <br>
 6:27 <B>{A soldier of his guard}</B> <b><i>(\spekoulatora\)</i></b>. Latin word<br>
 _speculator_. A spy, scout, lookout, and often executioner. It<br>
 was used of the bodyguard of the Roman emperor and so for one of<br>
 Herod's spies. He was used to do errands of this sort and it was<br>
 soon done. It was a gruesome job, but he soon brought John's head<br>
 to the damsel, apparently in the presence of all, and she took it<br>
 to her mother. This miserable Tetrarch, the slave of Herodias,<br>
 was now the slave of his fears. He is haunted by the ghost of<br>
 John and shudders at the reports of the work of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 6:29 <B>{His corpse}</B> <b><i>(\to pt&#333;ma autou\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 24:28. It was a<br>
 mournful time for the disciples of John. "They went and told<br>
 Jesus" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 14:12)</i></b>. What else could they do?<br>
 <br>
 6:30 <B>{And the apostles gather themselves together unto Jesus}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai sunagontai hoi apostoloi pros ton I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. Vivid<br>
 historical present. <B>{All things whatsoever they had done and<br>
 whatsoever they had taught}</B> <b><i>(\panta hosa epoi&#275;san kai hosa<br>
 edidaxan\)</i></b>. Not past perfect in the Greek, just the aorist<br>
 indicative, constative aorist that summed it all up, the story of<br>
 this their first tour without Jesus. And Jesus listened to it all<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:10)</i></b>. He was deeply concerned in the outcome.<br>
 <br>
 6:31 <B>{Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest<br>
 awhile}</B> <b><i>(\Deute humeis autoi kat' idian eis er&#275;mon topon kai<br>
 anapauesthe oligon\)</i></b>. It was plain that they were over-wrought<br>
 and excited and needed refreshment <b><i>(\anapauesthe\, middle voice,<br>
 refresh yourselves, "rest up" literally)</i></b>. This is one of the<br>
 needed lessons for all preachers and teachers, occasional change<br>
 and refreshment. Even Jesus felt the need of it. <B>{They had no<br>
 leisure so much as to eat}</B> <b><i>(\oude phagein eukairoun\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 tense again. Crowds were coming and going. Change was a<br>
 necessity.<br>
 <br>
 6:32 <B>{And they went away in a boat}</B> <b><i>(\kai ap&#275;lthon en t&#333;i<br>
 ploi&#333;i\)</i></b>. They accepted with alacrity and off they went.<br>
 <br>
 6:33 <B>{Outwent them}</B> <b><i>(\pro&#275;lthon autous\)</i></b>. The crowds were not to<br>
 be outdone. They recognized <b><i>(\egn&#333;san\)</i></b> Jesus and the disciples<br>
 and ran around the head of the lake on foot <b><i>(\pez&#275;i\)</i></b> and got<br>
 there ahead of Jesus and were waiting for Him when the boat came.<br>
 <br>
 6:34 <B>{They were as sheep not having a shepherd}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san h&#333;s<br>
 probata m&#275; echonta poimena\)</i></b>. Matthew has these words in another<br>
 context <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 9:26)</i></b>, but Mark alone has them here. \M&#275;\ is the<br>
 usual negative for the participle in the _Koin&#275;_. These excited<br>
 and exciting people <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b> greatly needed teaching. <!-#-->Mt 14:14<br>
 mentions healing as does <!-#-->Lu 9:11 <b><i>(both preaching and healing)</i></b>.<br>
 But a vigorous crowd of runners would not have many sick. The<br>
 people had plenty of official leaders but these rabbis were for<br>
 spiritual matters blind leaders of the blind. Jesus had come over<br>
 for rest, but his heart was touched by the pathos of this<br>
 situation. So "he began to teach them many things" <b><i>(\&#275;rxato<br>
 didaskein autous polla\)</i></b>. Two accusatives with the verb of<br>
 teaching and the present tense of the infinitive. He kept it up.<br>
 <br>
 6:35 <B>{When the day was now far spent}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;d&#275; h&#333;ras poll&#275;s<br>
 genomen&#275;s\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute. \H&#333;ra\ used here for day-time <b><i>(so<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 14:15)</i></b> as in Polybius and late Greek. <B>{Much day-time already<br>
 gone}</B>. <!-#-->Lu 9:12 has it began to <B>{incline}</B> <b><i>(\klinein\)</i></b> or wear<br>
 away. It was after 3 P.M., the first evening. Note second evening<br>
 or sunset in <!-#-->Mr 6:47; Mt 14:23; Joh 6:16. The turn of the<br>
 afternoon had come and sunset was approaching. The idiom is<br>
 repeated at the close of the verse. See on &#175;Mt 14:15.<br>
 <br>
 6:36 <B>{Into the country and villages round about}</B> <b><i>(\eis tous<br>
 kukl&#333;i agrous kai k&#333;mas\)</i></b>. The fields <b><i>(\agrous\)</i></b> were the<br>
 scattered farms <b><i>(Latin, _villae_)</i></b>. The villages <b><i>(\k&#333;mas\)</i></b> may<br>
 have included Bethsaida Julias not far away <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:10)</i></b>. The<br>
 other Bethsaida was on the Western side of the lake <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 6:45)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Somewhat to eat}</B> <b><i>(\ti phag&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Literally, <B>{what to eat}</B>,<br>
 <B>{what they were to eat}</B>. Deliberative subjunctive retained in the<br>
 indirect question.<br>
 <br>
 6:38 <B>{Go and see}</B> <b><i>(\hupagete idete\)</i></b>. John says that Jesus asked<br>
 Philip to find out what food they had <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:5f.)</i></b> probably<br>
 after the disciples had suggested that Jesus send the crowd away<br>
 as night was coming on <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 6:35f.)</i></b>. On this protest to his<br>
 command that they feed the crowds <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 6:37; Mt 14:16; Lu 9:13)</i></b><br>
 Jesus said "Go see" how many loaves you can get hold of. Then<br>
 Andrew reports the fact of the lad with five barley loaves and<br>
 two fishes <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:8f.)</i></b>. They had suggested before that two<br>
 hundred pennyworth <b><i>(\d&#275;nari&#333;n diakosi&#333;n\. See on &#175;Mt 18:28)</i></b> was<br>
 wholly inadequate and even that <b><i>(some thirty-five dollars)</i></b> was<br>
 probably all that or even more than they had with them. John's<br>
 Gospel alone tells of the lad with his lunch which his mother had<br>
 given him.<br>
 <br>
 6:39 <B>{By companies}</B> <b><i>(\sumposia sumposia\)</i></b>. Distribution expressed<br>
 by repetition as in <!-#-->Mr 6:7 <b><i>(\duo duo\)</i></b> instead of using \ana\<br>
 or \kata\. Literally our word _symposium_ and originally a<br>
 drinking party, Latin _convivium_, then the party of guests of<br>
 any kind without the notion of drinking. So in Plutarch and the<br>
 LXX <b><i>(especially I Macca.)</i></b>. <B>{Upon the green grass}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#333;i<br>
 chl&#333;r&#333;i chort&#333;i\)</i></b>. Another Markan touch. It was passover time<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:4)</i></b> and the afternoon sun shone upon the orderly groups<br>
 upon the green spring grass. See on &#175;Mt 14:15. They may have<br>
 been seated like companies at tables, open at one end.<br>
 <br>
 6:40 <B>{They sat down in ranks}</B> <b><i>(\anepesan prasiai prasiai\)</i></b>. They<br>
 half-way reclined <b><i>(\anaklith&#275;nai\, verse <!-#-->39)</i></b>. Fell up here <b><i>(we<br>
 have to say fell down)</i></b>, the word \anepesan\ means. But they were<br>
 arranged in groups by hundreds and by fifties and they looked<br>
 like garden beds with their many-coloured clothes which even men<br>
 wore in the Orient. Then again Mark repeats the word, \prasiai<br>
 prasiai\, in the nominative absolute as in verse <!-#-->39 instead of<br>
 using \ana\ or \kata\ with the accusative for the idea of<br>
 distribution. Garden beds, garden beds. Peter saw and he never<br>
 forgot the picture and so Mark caught it. There was colour as<br>
 well as order in the grouping. There were orderly walks between<br>
 the rows on rows of men reclining on the green grass. The grass<br>
 is not green in Palestine much of the year, mainly at the<br>
 passover time. So here the Synoptic Gospels have an indication of<br>
 more than a one-year ministry of Jesus <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>. It is still one<br>
 year before the last passover when Jesus was crucified.<br>
 <br>
 6:41 <B>{Brake the loaves; and he gave to the disciples}</B> <b><i>(\kai apo<br>
 t&#333;n ichthu&#333;n\)</i></b>. Apparently the fishes were in excess of the<br>
 twelve baskets full of broken pieces of bread. See on &#175;Mt 14:20<br>
 for discussion of \kophinos\ and \sphuris\, the two kinds of<br>
 baskets.<br>
 <br>
 6:44 <B>{Men}</B> <b><i>(\andres\)</i></b>. Men as different from women as in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 14:21. This remarkable miracle is recorded by all Four Gospels,<br>
 a nature miracle that only God can work. No talk about<br>
 accelerating natural processes will explain this miracle. And<br>
 three eyewitnesses report it: the Logia of Matthew, the eyes of<br>
 Peter in Mark, the witness of John the Beloved Disciple <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>.<br>
 The evidence is overwhelming.<br>
 <br>
 6:45 <B>{To Bethsaida}</B> <b><i>(\pros B&#275;thsaidan\)</i></b>. This is Bethsaida on the<br>
 Western side, not Bethsaida Julias on the Eastern side where they<br>
 had just been <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:10)</i></b>. <B>{While he himself sendeth the<br>
 multitude away}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s autos apoluei ton ochlon\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 14:22 has<br>
 it "till he should send away" <b><i>(\he&#333;s hou apolus&#275;i\)</i></b> with the<br>
 aorist subjunctive of purpose. Mark with the present indicative<br>
 \apoluei\ pictures Jesus as personally engaged in persuading the<br>
 crowds to go away now. <!-#-->Joh 6:41f. explains this activity of<br>
 Jesus. The crowds had become so excited that they were in the<br>
 mood to start a revolution against the Roman government and<br>
 proclaim Jesus king. He had already forced in reality the<br>
 disciples to leave in a boat <B>{to go before him}</B> <b><i>(\proagein\)</i></b> in<br>
 order to get them out of this atmosphere of overwrought<br>
 excitement with a political twist to the whole conception of the<br>
 Messianic Kingdom. They were in grave danger of being swept off<br>
 their feet and falling heedlessly into the Pharisaic conception<br>
 and so defeating the whole teaching and training of Jesus with<br>
 them. See on &#175;Mt 14:22,23. To this pass things had come one year<br>
 before the Crucifixion. He had done his best to help and bless<br>
 the crowds and lost his chance to rest. No one really understood<br>
 Jesus, not the crowds, not the disciples. Jesus needed the Father<br>
 to stay and steady him. The devil had come again to tempt him<br>
 with world dominion in league with the Pharisees, the populace,<br>
 and the devil in the background.<br>
 <br>
 6:47 <B>{When even was come}</B> <b><i>(\opsias genomen&#275;s\)</i></b>. The second or<br>
 late evening, six P.M. at this season, or sunset on. <B>{He alone on<br>
 the land}</B> <b><i>(\kai autos monos &#275;pi t&#275;s g&#275;s\)</i></b>. Another Markan touch.<br>
 Jesus had come down out of the mountain where he had prayed to<br>
 the Father. He is by the sea again in the late twilight.<br>
 Apparently Jesus remained quite a while, some hours, on the<br>
 beach. "It was now dark and Jesus had not yet come to them" <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 6:17)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:48 <B>{Seeing them distressed in rowing}</B> <b><i>(\id&#333;n autous<br>
 basanizomenous en t&#333;i elaunein\)</i></b>. See also <!-#-->Mt 8:29 for the word<br>
 \basaniz&#333;\, to torture, torment <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 4:24)</i></b> with a touch-stone,<br>
 then to distress as here. Papyri have \dia basan&#333;n\ used on<br>
 slaves like our third degree for criminals. \Elaunein\ is<br>
 literally to drive as of ships or chariots. They drove the boat<br>
 with oars. Common in Xenophon for marching. <B>{About the fourth<br>
 watch of the night}</B> <b><i>(\peri tetart&#275;n phulak&#275;n t&#275;s nuktos\)</i></b>. That<br>
 is, between three and six A.M. The wind was <B>{contrary to them}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\enantios autois\)</i></b>, that is in their faces and rowing was<br>
 difficult, "a great wind" <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:18)</i></b>, and as a result the<br>
 disciples had made little progress. They should have been over<br>
 long before this. <B>{And he would have passed by them}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 &#275;thelen parelthein autous\)</i></b>. Only in Mark. He wished to pass by<br>
 them, _praeterire eos_ <b><i>(Vulgate)</i></b>. Imperfect tense \&#275;thelen\.<br>
 <B>{They thought}</B> <b><i>(\edoxan\)</i></b>. A natural conclusion. <B>{And cried out}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anekraxan\)</i></b>. <B>{Cried up}</B>, literally, a shriek of terror, or<br>
 scream.<br>
 <br>
 6:50 <B>{It is I}</B> <b><i>(\ego eimi\)</i></b>. These were the astounding words of<br>
 cheer. They did not recognize Jesus in the darkness. They had<br>
 never seen him or any one walk on the water. His voice reassured<br>
 them.<br>
 <br>
 6:51 <B>{They were sore amazed in themselves}</B> <b><i>(\lian en heautois<br>
 existanto\)</i></b>. Only in Mark. Imperfect tense picturing vividly the<br>
 excited disciples. Mark does not give the incident of Peter's<br>
 walking on the water and beginning to sink. Perhaps Peter was not<br>
 fond of telling that story.<br>
 <br>
 6:52 <B>{For they understood not}</B> <b><i>(\ou gar sun&#275;kan\)</i></b>. Explanation of<br>
 their excessive amazement, viz., their failure to grasp the full<br>
 significance of the miracle of the loaves and fishes, a nature<br>
 miracle. Here was another, Jesus walking on the water. Their<br>
 reasoning process <b><i>(\kardia\ in the general sense for all the<br>
 inner man)</i></b> <B>{was hardened}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n pep&#333;r&#333;men&#275;\)</i></b>. See on &#175;3:5 about<br>
 \p&#333;r&#333;sis\. Today some men have such intellectual hardness or<br>
 denseness that they cannot believe that God can or would work<br>
 miracles, least of all nature miracles.<br>
 <br>
 6:53 <B>{And moored to the shore}</B> <b><i>(\kai pros&#333;rmisth&#275;san\)</i></b>. Only here<br>
 in the New Testament, though an old Greek verb and occurring in<br>
 the papyri. \Hormos\ is roadstead or anchorage. They cast anchor<br>
 or lashed the boat to a post on shore. It was at the plain of<br>
 Gennesaret several miles south of Bethsaida owing to the night<br>
 wind.<br>
 <br>
 6:54 <B>{Knew him}</B> <b><i>(\epignontes auton\)</i></b>. Recognizing Jesus, knowing<br>
 fully <b><i>(\epi\)</i></b> as nearly all did by now. Second aorist active<br>
 participle.<br>
 <br>
 6:55 <B>{Ran about}</B> <b><i>(\periedramon\)</i></b>. Vivid constative aorist<br>
 picturing the excited pursuit of Jesus as the news spread that he<br>
 was in Gennesaret. <B>{On their beds}</B> <b><i>(\epi tois krabattois\)</i></b>.<br>
 Pallets like that of the man let down through the roof <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 2:4)</i></b>. <B>{Where they heard he was}</B> <b><i>(\hopou &#275;kouon hoti estin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect tense of \akou&#333;\ <b><i>(repetition)</i></b>, present indicative<br>
 \estin\ retained in indirect discourse.<br>
 <br>
 6:56 <B>{Wheresoever he entered}</B> <b><i>(\hopou an eiseporeueto\)</i></b>. The<br>
 imperfect indicative with \an\ used to make a general indefinite<br>
 statement with the relative adverb. See the same construction at<br>
 the close of the verse, \hosoi an h&#275;psanto auton\ <b><i>(aorist<br>
 indicative and \an\ in a relative clause)</i></b>, <B>{as many as touched<br>
 him}</B>. One must enlarge the details here to get an idea of the<br>
 richness of the healing ministry of Jesus. We are now near the<br>
 close of the Galilean ministry with its many healing mercies and<br>
 excitement is at the highest pitch <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
