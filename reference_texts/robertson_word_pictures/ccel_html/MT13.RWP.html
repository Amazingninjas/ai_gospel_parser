<p>13:1 <B>{On that day}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i h&#275;merai ekein&#275;i\)</i></b>. So this group of<br>
 parables is placed by Matthew on the same day as the blasphemous<br>
 accusation and the visit of the mother of Jesus. It is called<br>
 "the Busy Day," not because it was the only one, but simply that<br>
 so much is told of this day that it serves as a specimen of many<br>
 others filled to the full with stress and strain. <B>{Sat by the<br>
 seaside}</B> <b><i>(\ekath&#275;to para t&#275;n thalassan\)</i></b>. The accusative case<br>
 need give no difficulty. Jesus came out of the stuffy house and<br>
 took his seat <b><i>(\ekath&#275;to\, imperfect)</i></b> along the shore with the<br>
 crowds stretched up and down, a picturesque scene.<br>
 <br>
 13:2 <B>{And all the multitude stood on the beach}</B> <b><i>(\kai pas ho<br>
 ochlos epi ton aigialon hist&#275;kei\)</i></b>. Past perfect tense of<br>
 \hist&#275;mi\ with imperfect sense, had taken a stand and so stood.<br>
 Note accusative also with \epi\ upon the beach where the waves<br>
 break one after the other <b><i>(\aigialos\ is from \hals\, sea, and<br>
 \agnumi\, to break, or from \aiss&#333;\, to rush)</i></b>. Jesus had to get<br>
 into a boat and sit down in that because of the crush of the<br>
 crowd.<br>
 <br>
 13:3 <B>{Many things in parables}</B> <b><i>(\polla en parabolais\)</i></b>. It was<br>
 not the first time that Jesus had used parables, but the first<br>
 time that he had spoken so many and some of such length. He will<br>
 use a great many in the future as in Luke 12 to 18 and Matt. 24<br>
 and 25. The parables already mentioned in Matthew include the<br>
 salt and the light <b><i>(<!-#-->5:13-16)</i></b>, the birds and the lilies<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->6:26-30)</i></b>, the splinter and the beam in the eye <b><i>(<!-#-->7:3-5)</i></b>, the<br>
 two gates <b><i>(<!-#-->7:13f.)</i></b>, the wolves in sheep's clothing <b><i>(<!-#-->7:15)</i></b>,<br>
 the good and bad trees <b><i>(<!-#-->7:17-19)</i></b>, the wise and foolish builders<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->7:24-27)</i></b>, the garment and the wineskins <b><i>(<!-#-->9:16f.)</i></b>, the<br>
 children in the market places <b><i>(<!-#-->11:16f.)</i></b>. It is not certain how<br>
 many he spoke on this occasion. Matthew mentions eight in this<br>
 chapter <b><i>(the Sower, the Tares, the Mustard Seed, the Leaven, the<br>
 Hid Treasure, the Pearl of Great Price, the Net, the<br>
 Householder)</i></b>. Mark adds the Parable of the Lamp <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 4:21; Lu<br>
 8:16)</i></b>, the Parable of the Seed Growing of Itself <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 4:26-29)</i></b>,<br>
 making ten of which we know. But both Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 4:33)</i></b> and<br>
 Matthew <b><i>(<!-#-->13:34)</i></b> imply that there were many others. "Without a<br>
 parable spake he nothing unto them" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 13:34)</i></b>, on this<br>
 occasion, we may suppose. The word parable <b><i>(\parabol&#275;\ from<br>
 \paraball&#333;\, to place alongside for measurement or comparison<br>
 like a yardstick)</i></b> is an objective illustration for spiritual or<br>
 moral truth. The word is employed in a variety of ways <b><i>(a)</i></b> as for<br>
 sententious sayings or proverbs <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 15:15; Mr 3:23; Lu 4:23;<br>
 5:36-39; 6:39)</i></b>, for a figure or type <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb. 9:9; 11:19)</i></b>; <b><i>(b)</i></b> a<br>
 comparison in the form of a narrative, the common use in the<br>
 Synoptic Gospels like the Sower; <b><i>(c)</i></b> "A narrative illustration<br>
 not involving a comparison" <b><i>(Broadus)</i></b>, like the Rich Fool, the<br>
 Good Samaritan, etc. "The oriental genius for picturesque speech<br>
 found expression in a multitude of such utterances" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 There are parables in the Old Testament, in the Talmud, in<br>
 sermons in all ages. But no one has spoken such parables as these<br>
 of Jesus. They hold the mirror up to nature and, as all<br>
 illustrations should do, throw light on the truth presented. The<br>
 fable puts things as they are not in nature, Aesop's Fables, for<br>
 instance. The parable may not be actual fact, but it could be so.<br>
 It is harmony with the nature of the case. The allegory<br>
 <b><i>(\all&#275;goria\)</i></b> is a speaking parable that is self-explanatory all<br>
 along like Bunyan's _Pilgrim's Progress_. All allegories are<br>
 parables, but not all parables are allegories. The Prodigal Son<br>
 is an allegory, as is the story of the Vine and Branches <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 15)</i></b>. John does not use the word parable, but only \paroimia\, a<br>
 saying by the way <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 10:6; 16:25,29)</i></b>. As a rule the parables<br>
 of Jesus illustrate one main point and the details are more or<br>
 less incidental, though sometimes Jesus himself explains these.<br>
 When he does not do so, we should be slow to interpret the minor<br>
 details. Much heresy has come from fantastic interpretations of<br>
 the parables. In the case of the Parable of the Sower <b><i>(<!-#-->13:3-8)</i></b><br>
 we have also the careful exposition of the story by Jesus<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->18-23)</i></b> as well as the reason for the use of parables on this<br>
 occasion by Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->9-17)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Behold, the sower went forth}</B> <b><i>(\idou &#275;lthen ho speir&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Matthew is very fond of this exclamation \idou\. It is "the<br>
 sower," not "a sower." Jesus expects one to see the man as he<br>
 stepped forth to begin scattering with his hand. The parables of<br>
 Jesus are vivid word pictures. To understand them one must see<br>
 them, with the eyes of Jesus if he can. Christ drew his parables<br>
 from familiar objects.<br>
 <br>
 13:4 <B>{As he sowed}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i speirein auton\)</i></b>. Literally, "in the<br>
 sowing as to him," a neat Greek idiom unlike our English temporal<br>
 conjunction. Locative case with the articular present infinitive.<br>
 <B>{By the wayside}</B> <b><i>(\para t&#275;n hodon\)</i></b>. People will make paths along<br>
 the edge of a ploughed field or even across it where the seed<br>
 lies upon the beaten track. <B>{Devoured}</B> <b><i>(\katephagen\)</i></b>.  "Ate<br>
 down." We say, "ate up." Second aorist active indicative of<br>
 \katesthi&#333;\ <b><i>(defective verb)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:5 <B>{The rocky places}</B> <b><i>(\ta petr&#333;d&#275;\)</i></b>. In that limestone country<br>
 ledges of rock often jut out with thin layers of soil upon the<br>
 layers of rock. <B>{Straightway they sprang up}</B> <b><i>(\euthe&#333;s<br>
 exaneteilen\)</i></b>. "Shot up at once" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>. Double compound<br>
 <b><i>(\ex\, out of the ground, \ana\, up)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist of<br>
 \exanatell&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 13:6 <B>{The sun was risen}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;liou anateilantos\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute. "The sun having sprung up" also, same verb except the<br>
 absence of \ex\ <b><i>(\anatell&#333;, exanatell&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:7 <B>{The thorns grew up}</B> <b><i>(\aneb&#275;san hai akanthai\)</i></b>. Not "sprang<br>
 up" as in verse <!-#-->5, for a different verb occurs meaning "came<br>
 up" out of the ground, the seeds of the thorns being already in<br>
 the soil, "upon the thorns" <b><i>(\epi tas akanthas\)</i></b> rather than<br>
 "among the thorns." But the thorns got a quick start as weeds<br>
 somehow do and "choked them" <b><i>(\apepnixan auta\, effective aorist<br>
 of \apopnig&#333;\)</i></b>, "choked them off" literally. Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:33)</i></b><br>
 uses it of the hogs in the water. Who has not seen vegetables and<br>
 flowers and corn made yellow by thorns and weeds till they sicken<br>
 and die?<br>
 <br>
 13:8 <B>{Yielded fruit}</B> <b><i>(\edidou karpon\)</i></b>. Change to imperfect tense<br>
 of \did&#333;mi\, to give, for it was continuous fruit-bearing. <B>{Some<br>
 a hundredfold}</B> <b><i>(\ho men hekaton\)</i></b>. Variety, but fruit. This is<br>
 the only kind that is worth while. The hundredfold is not an<br>
 exaggeration <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ge 26:12)</i></b>. Such instances are given by<br>
 Wetstein for Greece, Italy, and Africa. Herodotus <b><i>(i. 93)</i></b> says<br>
 that in Babylonia grain yielded two hundredfold and even to three<br>
 hundredfold. This, of course, was due to irrigation as in the<br>
 Nile Valley.<br>
 <br>
 13:9 <B>{He that hath ears let him hear}</B> <b><i>(\ho ech&#333;n &#333;ta akouet&#333;\)</i></b>,<br>
 So also in <!-#-->11:15 and <!-#-->13:43. It is comforting to teachers and<br>
 preachers to observe that even Jesus had to exhort people to<br>
 listen and to understand his sayings, especially his parables.<br>
 They will bear the closest thought and are often enigmatical.<br>
 <br>
 13:10 <B>{Why speakest thou unto them in parables?}</B> <b><i>(\dia ti en<br>
 parabolais laleis autois\)</i></b>. Already the disciples are puzzled<br>
 over the meaning of this parable and the reason for giving them<br>
 to the people. So they "came up" closer to Jesus and asked him.<br>
 Jesus was used to questions and surpassed all teachers in his<br>
 replies.<br>
 <br>
 13:11 <B>{To know the mysteries}</B> <b><i>(\gn&#333;nai ta must&#275;ria\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active infinitive of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\. The word \must&#275;rion\ is<br>
 from \must&#275;s\, one initiated, and that from \mue&#333;\ <b><i>(\mu&#333;\)</i></b>, to<br>
 close or shut <b><i>(Latin, _mutus_)</i></b>. The mystery-religions of the east<br>
 had all sorts of secrets and signs as secret societies do today.<br>
 But those initiated knew them. So the disciples have been<br>
 initiated into the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. Paul will<br>
 use it freely of the mystery once hidden, but now revealed, now<br>
 made known in Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 16:25; 1Co 2:7, etc.)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Php 4:12<br>
 Paul says: "I have learned the secret or been initiated"<br>
 <b><i>(\memu&#275;mai\)</i></b>. So Jesus here explains that his parables are open<br>
 to the disciples, but shut to the Pharisees with their hostile<br>
 minds. In the Gospels \must&#275;rion\ is used only here and in the<br>
 parallel passages <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 4:11; Lu 8:10)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:13 <B>{Because seeing}</B> <b><i>(\hoti blepontes\)</i></b>. In the parallel<br>
 passages in <!-#-->Mr 4:12 and <!-#-->Lu 8:10 we find \hina\ with the<br>
 subjunctive. This does not necessarily mean that in Mark and Luke<br>
 \hina=hoti\ with the causal sense, though a few rare instances of<br>
 such usage may be found in late Greek. For a discussion of the<br>
 problem see my chapter on "The Causal Use of _Hina_"  in _Studies 
 in Early Christianity_ <b><i>(1928)</i></b> edited by Prof. S.J. Case. Here in<br>
 Matthew we have first "an adaptation of <!-#-->Isa 6:9f. which is<br>
 quoted in full in v. <!-#-->14f." <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. Thus Matthew presents "a<br>
 striking paradox, 'though they see, they do not <b><i>(really)</i></b> see'"<br>
 <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Joh 9:41. The idiom here in Matthew gives no<br>
 trouble save in comparison with Mark and Luke which will be<br>
 discussed in due turn. The form \suniousin\ is an omega verb form<br>
 <b><i>(\suni&#333;\)</i></b> rather than the \mi\ verb <b><i>(\suni&#275;mi\)</i></b> as is common in<br>
 the _Koin&#275;_.<br>
 <br>
 13:14 <B>{Is fulfilled}</B> <b><i>(\anapl&#275;routai\)</i></b>. Aoristic present passive<br>
 indicative. Here Jesus points out the fulfilment and not with<br>
 Matthew's usual formula <b><i>(\hina\ or \hop&#333;s pl&#333;r&#275;th&#275;i to rh&#275;then\)</i></b><br>
 <b><i>(see <!-#-->1:22)</i></b>. The verb \anapl&#275;ro&#333;\ occurs nowhere else in the<br>
 Gospels, but occurs in the Pauline Epistles. It means to fill up<br>
 like a cup, to fill another's place <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 14:16)</i></b>, to fill up<br>
 what is lacking <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 2:30)</i></b>. Here it means that the prophecy of<br>
 Isaiah is fully satisfied in the conduct of the Pharisees and<br>
 Jesus himself points it out. Note two ways of reproducing the<br>
 Hebrew idiom <b><i>(infinitive absolute)</i></b>, one by \ako&#275;i\ the other by<br>
 \blepontes\. Note also the strong negative \ou m&#275;\ with aorist<br>
 subjunctive.<br>
 <br>
 13:15 <B>{Is waxed gross}</B> <b><i>(\epachunth&#275;\)</i></b>. Aorist passive tense. From<br>
 \pachus\, thick, fat, stout. Made callous or dull -- even fatty<br>
 degeneration of the heart. <B>{Dull of hearing}</B> <b><i>(\tois &#333;sin bare&#333;s<br>
 &#275;kousan\)</i></b>. Another aorist. Literally, "They heard <b><i>(or hear)</i></b><br>
 heavily with their ears." The hard of hearing are usually<br>
 sensitive. <B>{Their eyes they have closed}</B> <b><i>(\tous ophthalmous aut&#333;n<br>
 ekammusan\)</i></b>. The epic and vernacular verb \kammu&#333;\ is from<br>
 \katamu&#333;\ <b><i>(to shut down)</i></b>. We say shut up of the mouth, but the<br>
 eyes really shut down. The Hebrew verb in <!-#-->Isa 6:10 means to<br>
 smear over. The eyes can be smeared with wax or cataract and thus<br>
 closed. "Sealing up the eyes was an oriental punishment"<br>
 <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Isa 29:10; 44:18. <B>{Lest}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;pote\)</i></b>. This<br>
 negative purpose as a judgment is left in the quotation from<br>
 Isaiah. It is a solemn thought for all who read or hear the word<br>
 of God. <B>{And I should heal them}</B> <b><i>(\kai iasomai autous\)</i></b>. Here the<br>
 LXX changes to the future indicative rather than the aorist<br>
 subjunctive as before.<br>
 <br>
 13:16 <B>{Blessed are your eyes}</B> <b><i>(\hum&#333;n de makarioi hoi<br>
 ophthalmoi\)</i></b>. A beatitude for the disciples in contrast with the<br>
 Pharisees. Note position of "Happy" here also as in the<br>
 Beatitudes in <!-#-->Mt 5.<br>
 <br>
 13:18 <B>{Hear then ye the parable}</B> <b><i>(\humeis oun akousate t&#275;n<br>
 parabol&#275;n\)</i></b>. Jesus has given in <!-#-->13:13 one reason for his use of<br>
 parables, the condemnation which the Pharisees have brought on<br>
 themselves by their spiritual dulness: "Therefore I speak to them<br>
 in parables" <b><i>(\dia touto en parab&#333;lais antois lal&#333;\)</i></b>. He can go<br>
 on preaching the mysteries of the kingdom without their<br>
 comprehending what he is saying, but he is anxious that the<br>
 disciples really get personal knowledge <b><i>(\gn&#333;nai\, verse <!-#-->11)</i></b> of<br>
 these same mysteries. So he explains in detail what he means to<br>
 teach by the Parable of the Sower. He appeals to them <b><i>(note<br>
 position of \h&#8211;meis\)</i></b> to listen as he explains.<br>
 <br>
 13:19 <B>{When anyone heareth}</B> <b><i>(\pantos akouontos\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute and present participle, "while everyone is listening and<br>
 not comprehending" <b><i>(\m&#275; sunientos\)</i></b>, "not putting together" or<br>
 "not grasping." Perhaps at that very moment Jesus observed a<br>
 puzzled look on some faces.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Cometh the evil one and snatcheth away}</B> <b><i>(\erchetai ho pon&#275;ros<br>
 kai harpazei\)</i></b>. The birds pick up the seeds while the sower sows.<br>
 The devil is busy with his job of snatching or seizing like a<br>
 bandit or rogue the word of the kingdom before it has time even<br>
 to sprout. How quickly after the sermon the impression is gone.<br>
 "This is he" <b><i>(\houtos estin\)</i></b>. Matthew, like Mark, speaks of the<br>
 people who hear the words as the seed itself. That creates some<br>
 confusion in this condensed form of what Jesus actually said, but<br>
 the real point is clear. <B>{The seed sown in his heart}</B> <b><i>(\to<br>
 esparmenon en t&#275;i kardi&#257;i autou\, perfect passive participle of<br>
 \speir&#333;\, to sow)</i></b> and "the man sown by the wayside" <b><i>(\ho para t&#275;n<br>
 hodon spareis\, aorist passive participle, along the wayside)</i></b> are<br>
 identified. The seed in the heart is not of itself responsible,<br>
 but the man who lets the devil snatch it away.<br>
 <br>
 13:21 <B>{Yet hath he not root in himself}</B> <b><i>(\ouk echei de rhizan en<br>
 heaut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Col 2:7 and <!-#-->Eph 3:18 \erriz&#333;memoi\. Stability<br>
 like a tree. Here the man has a mushroom growth and "endureth for<br>
 a while" <b><i>(\proskairos\)</i></b>, temporary, quick to sprout, quick to<br>
 stumble <b><i>(\skandalizetai\)</i></b>. What a picture of some converts in our<br>
 modern revivals. They drop away overnight because they did not<br>
 have the root of the matter in them. This man does not last or<br>
 hold out.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Tribulation}</B> <b><i>(\thlipse&#333;s\)</i></b>. From \thlib&#333;\, to press, to oppress,<br>
 to squeeze <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->7:14)</i></b>. The English word is from the Latin<br>
 _tribulum_, the roller used by the Romans for pressing wheat. Cf.<br>
 our "steam roller" Trench <b><i>(_Synonyms of the N.T._, pp. 202-4)</i></b>:<br>
 "When, according to the ancient law of England, those who<br>
 wilfully refused to plead, had heavy weights placed on their<br>
 breasts, and were pressed and crushed to death, this was<br>
 literally \thlipsis\." The iron cage was \stenoch&#333;ria\.<br>
 <br>
 13:22 <B>{Choke the word}</B> <b><i>(\sunpnigei ton logon\)</i></b>. We had<br>
 \apepnixan\ <b><i>(choked off)</i></b> in <!-#-->13:7. Here it is \sunpnigei\ <b><i>(choke<br>
 together)</i></b>, historical present and singular with both subjects<br>
 lumped together. "Lust for money and care go together and between<br>
 them spoil many an earnest religious nature" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>, "thorns"<br>
 indeed. The thorns flourish and the character sickens and dies,<br>
 choked to death for lack of spiritual food, air, sunshine.<br>
 <br>
 13:23 <B>{Verily beareth fruit}</B> <b><i>(\d&#275; karpophorei\)</i></b>. Who in reality<br>
 <b><i>(\d&#275;\)</i></b> does bear fruit <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mt 7:16-20)</i></b>. The fruit reveals the<br>
 character of the tree and the value of the straw for wheat. Some<br>
 grain must come else it is only chaff, straw, worthless. The<br>
 first three classes have no fruit and so show that they are<br>
 unfruitful soil, unsaved souls and lives. There is variety in<br>
 those who do bear fruit, but they have some fruit. The lesson of<br>
 the parable as explained by Jesus is precisely this, the variety<br>
 in the results of the seed sown according to the soil on which it<br>
 falls. Every teacher and preacher knows how true this is. It is<br>
 the teacher's task as the sower to sow the right seed, the word<br>
 of the kingdom. The soil determines the outcome. There are<br>
 critics today who scout this interpretation of the parable by<br>
 Jesus as too allegorical with too much detail and probably not<br>
 that really given by Jesus since modern scholars are not agreed<br>
 on the main point of the parable. But the average Christian sees<br>
 the point all right. This parable was not meant to explain all<br>
 the problems of human life.<br>
 <br>
 13:24 <B>{Set he before them}</B> <b><i>(\pareth&#275;ken\)</i></b>. So again in <!-#-->13:31.<br>
 He placed another parable beside <b><i>(\para\)</i></b> the one already given<br>
 and explained. The same verb <b><i>(\paratheinai\)</i></b> occurs in <!-#-->Lu 9:16.<br>
 <B>{Is likened}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;moi&#333;th&#275;\)</i></b>. Timeless aorist passive and a common<br>
 way of introducing these parables of the kingdom where a<br>
 comparison is drawn <b><i>(<!-#-->18:23; 22:2; 25:1)</i></b>. The case of<br>
 \anthr&#333;p&#333;i\ is associative instrumental.<br>
 <br>
 13:25 <B>{While men slept}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i katheudein tous anthr&#333;pous\)</i></b>.<br>
 Same use of the articular present infinitive with \en\ and the<br>
 accusative as in <!-#-->13:4. <B>{Sowed tares also}</B> <b><i>(\epespeiren ta<br>
 zizania\)</i></b>. Literally "sowed upon," "resowed" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>. The enemy<br>
 deliberately sowed "the darnel" <b><i>(\zizania\ is not "tares," but<br>
 "darnel," a bastard wheat)</i></b> over <b><i>(\epi\)</i></b> the wheat, "in the midst<br>
 of the wheat." This bearded darnel, _lolium temulentum_, is<br>
 common in Palestine and resembles wheat except that the grains<br>
 are black. In its earlier stages it is indistinguishable from the<br>
 wheat stalks so that it has to remain till near the harvest.<br>
 Modern farmers are gaining more skill in weeding it out.<br>
 <br>
 13:26 <B>{Then appeared also}</B> <b><i>(\tote ephan&#275; kai\)</i></b>. The darnel became<br>
 plain <b><i>(\ephan&#275;\, second aorist passive, effective aorist of<br>
 \phain&#333;\ to show)</i></b> by harvest.<br>
 <br>
 13:29 <B>{Ye root up the wheat with them}</B> <b><i>(\ekriz&#333;s&#275;te hama autois<br>
 ton siton\)</i></b>. Literally, "root out." Easy to do with the roots of<br>
 wheat and darnel intermingled in the field. So \sullegontes\ is<br>
 not "gather up," but "gather together," here and verses <!-#-->28 and<br>
 <!-#-->30. Note other compound verbs here, "grow together"<br>
 <b><i>(\sunauxanesthai\)</i></b>, "burn up" <b><i>(\katakausai\, burn down or<br>
 completely)</i></b>, "bring together" <b><i>(\sunagete\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:30 <B>{My barn}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n apoth&#275;k&#275;n mou\)</i></b>. See already <!-#-->3:12; 6:26.<br>
 Granary, storehouse, place for putting things away.<br>
 <br>
 13:31 <B>{Is like}</B> <b><i>(\homoia estin\)</i></b>. Adjective for comparison with<br>
 associative instrumental as in <!-#-->13:13,44,45,47,52. <B>{Grain of<br>
 mustard seed}</B> <b><i>(\kokk&#333;i sinape&#333;s\)</i></b>. Single grain in contrast with<br>
 the collective \sperma\ <b><i>(<!-#-->17:20)</i></b>. <B>{Took and sowed}</B> <b><i>(\lab&#333;n<br>
 espeiren\)</i></b>. Vernacular phrasing like Hebrew and all<br>
 conversational style. In _Koin&#275;_.<br>
 <br>
 13:32 <B>{A tree}</B> <b><i>(\dendron\)</i></b>. "Not in nature, but in size" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 "An excusable exaggeration in popular discourse."<br>
 <br>
 13:33 <B>{Is like unto leaven}</B> <b><i>(\homoia estin zum&#275;i\)</i></b>. In its<br>
 pervasive power. Curiously enough some people deny that Jesus<br>
 here likens the expanding power of the Kingdom of heaven to<br>
 leaven, because, they say, leaven is the symbol of corruption.<br>
 But the language of Jesus is not to be explained away by such<br>
 exegetical jugglery. The devil is called like a lion by Peter<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 5:8)</i></b> and Jesus in Revelation is called the Lion of the<br>
 Tribe of Judah <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 5:5)</i></b>. The leaven permeates all the "wheaten<br>
 meal" <b><i>(\aleurou\)</i></b> till the whole is leavened. There is nothing in<br>
 the "three measures," merely a common amount to bake. Dr. T.R.<br>
 Glover in his _Jesus of History_ suggests that Jesus used to<br>
 notice his mother using that amount of wheat flour in baking<br>
 bread. To find the Trinity here is, of course, quite beside the<br>
 mark. The word for leaven, \zum&#275;\, is from \ze&#333;\, to boil, to<br>
 seethe, and so pervasive fermentation.<br>
 <br>
 13:35 <B>{I will utter}</B> <b><i>(\ereuxomai\)</i></b>. To cast forth like a river,<br>
 to gurgle, to disgorge, the passion of a prophet. From <!-#-->Ps 19:2;<br>
 78:2. The Psalmist claims to be able to utter "things hidden<br>
 from the foundation of the world" and Matthew applies this<br>
 language to the words of Jesus. Certain it is that the life and<br>
 teaching of Jesus throw a flood of light on the purposes of God<br>
 long kept hidden <b><i>(\kekrummena\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:36 <B>{Explain unto us}</B> <b><i>(\diasaph&#275;son h&#275;min\)</i></b>. Also in <!-#-->18:31.<br>
 "Make thoroughly clear right now" <b><i>(aorist tense of urgency)</i></b>. The<br>
 disciples waited till Jesus left the crowds and got into the<br>
 house to ask help on this parable. Jesus had opened up the<br>
 Parable of the Sower and now they pick out this one, passing by<br>
 the mustard seed and the leaven.<br>
 <br>
 13:38 <B>{The field is the world}</B> <b><i>(\ho de agros estin ho kosmos\)</i></b>.<br>
 The article with both "field" and "world" in Greek means that<br>
 subject and predicate are coextensive and so interchangeable. It<br>
 is extremely important to understand that both the good seed and<br>
 the darnel <b><i>(tares)</i></b> are sown in the world, not in the Kingdom, not<br>
 in the church. The separation comes at the consummation of the<br>
 age <b><i>(\sunteleia ai&#333;nos\, <!-#-->39)</i></b>, the harvest time. They all grow<br>
 together in the field <b><i>(the world)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:41 <B>{Out of his kingdom}</B> <b><i>(\ek t&#275;s basileias autou\)</i></b>. Out from<br>
 the midst of the kingdom, because in every city the good and the<br>
 bad are scattered and mixed together. Cf. \ek mesou t&#333;n dikai&#333;n\<br>
 in <!-#-->13:49 "from the midst of the righteous." What this means is<br>
 that, just as the wheat and the darnel are mixed together in the<br>
 field till the separation at harvest, so the evil are mixed with<br>
 the good in the world <b><i>(the field)</i></b>. Jesus does not mean to say<br>
 that these "stumbling-blocks" <b><i>(\ta skandala\)</i></b> are actually in the<br>
 Kingdom of heaven and really members of the Kingdom. They are<br>
 simply mixed in the field with the wheat and God leaves them in<br>
 the world till the separation comes. Their destiny is "the<br>
 furnace of fire" <b><i>(\t&#275;n kaminon tou puros\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:43 <B>{Shine forth}</B> <b><i>(\eklampsousin\)</i></b>. Shine out as the sun comes<br>
 from behind a cloud <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b> and drive away the darkness after<br>
 the separation has come <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Da 12:3)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:44 <B>{And hid}</B> <b><i>(\kai ekrupsen\)</i></b>. Not necessarily bad morality.<br>
 "He may have hid it to prevent it being stolen, or to prevent<br>
 himself from being anticipated in buying a field" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. But<br>
 if it was a piece of sharp practice, that is not the point of the<br>
 parable. That is, the enormous wealth of the Kingdom for which<br>
 any sacrifice, all that one has, is not too great a price to pay.<br>
 <br>
 13:46 <B>{He went and sold}</B> <b><i>(\apelth&#333;n pepraken\)</i></b>. Rather eagerly<br>
 and vividly told thus, "He has gone off and sold." The present<br>
 perfect indicative, the dramatic perfect of vivid picture. Then<br>
 he bought it. Present perfect, imperfect, aorist tenses together<br>
 for lively action. \Empor&#333;i\ is a merchant, one who goes in and<br>
 out, travels like a drummer.<br>
 <br>
 13:47 <B>{A net}</B> <b><i>(\sag&#275;n&#275;i\)</i></b>. Drag-net. Latin, _sagena_, English,<br>
 seine. The ends were stretched out and drawn together. Only<br>
 example of the word in the N.T. Just as the field is the world,<br>
 so the drag-net catches all the fish that are in the sea. The<br>
 separation comes afterwards. Vincent pertinently quotes Homer's<br>
 _Odyssey_ <b><i>(xxii. 384-389)</i></b> where the slain suitors in the halls of<br>
 Ulysses are likened to fishes on the shore caught by nets with<br>
 myriad meshes.<br>
 <br>
 13:48 <B>{Vessels}</B> <b><i>(\agg&#275;\)</i></b>. Here only in the N.T. In <!-#-->Mt 25:4 we<br>
 have \aggeia\.<br>
 <br>
 13:52 <B>{Made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven}</B> <b><i>(\matheteutheis<br>
 t&#275;i basilei&#257;i t&#333;n ouran&#333;n\)</i></b>. First aorist passive participle. The<br>
 verb is transitive in <!-#-->28:19. Here a scribe is made a learner to<br>
 the kingdom. "The mere scribe, Rabbinical in spirit, produces<br>
 only the old and stale. The disciple of the kingdom like the<br>
 Master, is always fresh-minded, yet knows how to value all old<br>
 spiritual treasures of Holy Writ, or Christian tradition"<br>
 <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. So he uses things fresh <b><i>(\kaina\)</i></b> and ancient<br>
 <b><i>(\palaia\)</i></b>. "He hurls forth" <b><i>(\ekballei\)</i></b> both sorts.<br>
 <br>
 13:54 <B>{Is not this the carpenter's son?}</B> <b><i>(\ouch houtos estin ho<br>
 tou tekt&#333;nos huios?\)</i></b>. The well-known, the leading, or even for a<br>
 time the only carpenter in Nazareth till Jesus took the place of<br>
 Joseph as the carpenter. What the people of Nazareth could not<br>
 comprehend was how one with the origin and environment of Jesus<br>
 here in Nazareth could possess the wisdom which he appeared to<br>
 have in his teaching <b><i>(\edidasken\)</i></b>. That has often puzzled people<br>
 how a boy whom they knew could become the man he apparently is<br>
 after leaving them. They knew Joseph, Mary, the brothers <b><i>(four of<br>
 them named)</i></b> and sisters <b><i>(names not given)</i></b>. Jesus passed here as<br>
 the son of Joseph and these were younger brothers and sisters<br>
 <b><i>(half brothers and sisters technically)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:57 <B>{And they were offended in him}</B> <b><i>(\kai eskandalizonto en<br>
 aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Graphic imperfect passive. Literally, "They stumbled at<br>
 him," "They were repelled by him" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>, "They turned against<br>
 him" <b><i>(Weymouth)</i></b>. It was unpardonable for Jesus not to be<br>
 commonplace like themselves. <B>{Not without honour}</B> <b><i>(\ouk estin<br>
 atimos\)</i></b>. This is a proverb found in Jewish, Greek, and Roman<br>
 writers. Seen also in the _Logia of Jesus_ <b><i>(_Oxyr. Papyri_ i. 3)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:58 <B>{Mighty works}</B> <b><i>(\dunameis\)</i></b>. Powers. The "disbelief"<br>
 <b><i>(\apistian\)</i></b> of the townspeople blocked the will and the power of<br>
 Jesus to work cures.<br>
