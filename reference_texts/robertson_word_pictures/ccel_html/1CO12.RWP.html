<p>12:1 <B>{Now concerning spiritual gifts}</B> <b><i>(\peri de t&#333;n<br>
 pneumatik&#333;n\)</i></b>. Clearly one of the items asked about in the letter<br>
 to Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->7:1)</i></b> and introduced precisely as the problem of meats<br>
 offered to idols <b><i>(<!-#-->8:1)</i></b>. This question runs to the end of<br>
 chapter 14. Plainly much trouble had arisen in Corinth in the<br>
 exercise of these gifts.<br>
 <br>
 12:2 <B>{Ye were led away}</B> <b><i>(\apagomenoi\)</i></b>. The copula \&#275;te\ is not<br>
 expressed <b><i>(common ellipsis)</i></b> with the participle <b><i>(periphrastic<br>
 imperfect passive)</i></b>, but it has to be supplied to make sense. Some<br>
 scholars would change \hote\ <b><i>(when)</i></b> to \pote\ <b><i>(once)</i></b> and so<br>
 remove the difficulty. <B>{Unto those dumb idols}</B> <b><i>(\pros ta eid&#333;la<br>
 ta aph&#333;na\)</i></b>. "Unto the idols the dumb." See <!-#-->Ps 95:5-7 for the<br>
 voicelessness <b><i>(\a-ph&#333;na\, old adjective, without voice, \ph&#333;n&#275;\)</i></b><br>
 of the idols. Pagans were led astray by demons <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 10:19f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Howsoever ye might be led}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s an &#275;gesthe\)</i></b>. Rather, "as often<br>
 as ye were led." For this use of \h&#333;s an\ for the notion of<br>
 repetition, regular _Koin&#275;_ idiom, see Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 974. Cf. \hopou an\ in <!-#-->Mr 6:56.<br>
 <br>
 12:3 <B>{Wherefore I give you to understand}</B> <b><i>(\dio gn&#333;riz&#333; humin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Causative idea <b><i>(only in Aeschylus in old Greek)</i></b> in papyri <b><i>(also<br>
 in sense of recognize)</i></b> and N.T., from root \gn&#333;\ in \gin&#333;sk&#333;\, to<br>
 know. <B>{Speaking in the Spirit of God}</B> <b><i>(\en pneumati theou<br>
 lal&#333;n\)</i></b>. Either sphere or instrumentality. No great distinction<br>
 here between \lale&#333;\ <b><i>(utter sounds)</i></b> and \leg&#333;\ <b><i>(to say)</i></b>. <B>{Jesus<br>
 is anathema}</B> <b><i>(\anathema I&#275;sous\)</i></b>. On distinction between<br>
 \anathema\ <b><i>(curse)</i></b> and \anath&#275;ma\ <b><i>(offering <!-#-->Lu 21:5)</i></b> see<br>
 discussion there. In LXX \anath&#275;ma\ means a thing devoted to God<br>
 without being redeemed, doomed to destruction <b><i>(<!-#-->Le 27:28f.; Jos<br>
 6:17; 7:12)</i></b>. See <!-#-->1Co 16:22; Ga 1:8f.; Ro 9:3. This blasphemous<br>
 language against Jesus was mainly by the Jews <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 13:45; 18:6)</i></b>.<br>
 It is even possible that Paul had once tried to make Christians<br>
 say \Anathema I&#275;sous\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 26:11)</i></b>. <B>{Jesus is Lord}</B> <b><i>(\Kurios<br>
 I&#275;sous\)</i></b>. The term \Kurios\, as we have seen, is common in the<br>
 LXX for God. The Romans used it freely for the emperor in the<br>
 emperor worship. "Most important of all is the early<br>
 establishment of a polemical parallelism between the cult of<br>
 Christ and the cult of Caesar in the application of the term<br>
 \Kurios\, 'lord.' The new texts have here furnished quite<br>
 astonishing revelations" <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient<br>
 East_, p. 349)</i></b>. Inscriptions, ostraca, papyri apply the term to<br>
 Roman emperors, particularly to Nero when Paul wrote this very<br>
 letter <b><i>(_ib._, p. 353f.)</i></b>: "One with 'Nero Kurios' quite in the<br>
 manner of a formula <b><i>(without article, like the 'Kurios Jesus' in<br>
 <!-#-->1Co 12:3." "The battle-cries of the spirits of error and of<br>
 truth contending at Corinth"(Findlay)</i></b>. One is reminded of the<br>
 demand made by Polycarp that he say \Kurios Caesar\ and how each<br>
 time he replied \Kurios I&#275;sous\. He paid the penalty for his<br>
 loyalty with his life. Lighthearted men today can say "Lord<br>
 Jesus" in a flippant or even in an irreverent way, but no Jew or<br>
 Gentile then said it who did not mean it.<br>
 <br>
 12:4 <B>{Diversities}</B> <b><i>(\diaireseis\)</i></b>. Old word for distinctions,<br>
 differences, distributions, from \diaire&#333;\, to distribute, as<br>
 \diairoun\ <b><i>(dividing, distributing)</i></b> in verse <!-#-->11. Only here in<br>
 the N.T. <B>{Of gifts}</B> <b><i>(\charismat&#333;n\)</i></b>. Late word and chiefly in<br>
 Paul <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ro 12:6)</i></b> in N.T. <b><i>(except <!-#-->1Pe 4:19)</i></b>, but some<br>
 examples in papyri. It means a favour <b><i>(from \charizomai\)</i></b><br>
 bestowed or received without any merit as in <!-#-->Ro 1:11.<br>
 <br>
 12:5 <B>{Of ministrations}</B> <b><i>(\diakoni&#333;n\)</i></b>. This old word is from<br>
 \diakonos\ and has a general meaning of service as here <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro<br>
 11:13)</i></b> and a special ministration like that of Martha <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 10:40)</i></b> and the collection <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 16:15; 2Co 8:4)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:6 <B>{Of workings}</B> <b><i>(\energ&#275;mat&#333;n\)</i></b>. Late word, here only in N.T.,<br>
 the effect of a thing wrought <b><i>(from \energe&#333;\, to operate,<br>
 perform, energize)</i></b>. Paul uses also the late kindred word<br>
 \energeia\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 1:29; 2:12)</i></b> for efficiency. <B>{Who worketh all<br>
 things in all}</B> <b><i>(\ho energ&#333;n ta panta en pasin\)</i></b>. Paul is not<br>
 afraid to say that God is the Energy and the Energizer of the<br>
 Universe. "I say that the magnet floats in space by the will of<br>
 God" <b><i>(Dr. W. R. Whitney, a world figure in science)</i></b>. This is his<br>
 philosophic and scientific theory of the Cosmos. No one has shown<br>
 Paul's philosophy and science to be wrong. Here he is speaking<br>
 only of spiritual gifts and results as a whole, but he applies<br>
 this principle to the universe <b><i>(\ta panta\)</i></b> in <!-#-->Col 1:16 <b><i>(of<br>
 Christ)</i></b> and in <!-#-->Ro 11:36 <b><i>(of God)</i></b>. Note the Trinity in these<br>
 verses: the same Spirit <b><i>(verse <!-#-->4)</i></b>, the same Lord <b><i>(Jesus)</i></b> in<br>
 verse <!-#-->5, the same God <b><i>(the Father)</i></b> in verse <!-#-->6.<br>
 <br>
 12:7 <B>{Manifestation}</B> <b><i>(\phaner&#333;sis\)</i></b>. Late word, in papyri, in<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->2Co 4:2, from \phanero&#333;\, to make manifest<br>
 <b><i>(\phaneros\)</i></b>. Each instance of the whole <b><i>(verse <!-#-->6)</i></b> is<br>
 repeatedly given <b><i>(\didotai\, present passive indicative of<br>
 \did&#333;mi\)</i></b>. <B>{To profit withal}</B> <b><i>(\pros to sumpheron\)</i></b>. See on<br>
 <!-#-->6:12; 10:23,33 for Paul's guiding principle in such matters.<br>
 <br>
 12:8 <B>{To one}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;i men\)</i></b>. Demonstrative \hos\ with \men\ in<br>
 dative case, to this one. The distribution or correlation is<br>
 carried on by \all&#333;i de\ <b><i>(verses <!-#-->8,9,10)</i></b>, \heter&#333;i de\ <b><i>(verses<br>
 <!-#-->9,10)</i></b> for variety, nine manifestations of the Spirit's work in<br>
 verses <!-#-->8-10. <B>{The Word of wisdom}</B> <b><i>(\logos sophias\)</i></b>. Old words.<br>
 \Logos\ is reason, then speech. Wisdom is intelligence, then<br>
 practical action in accord with it. Here it is speech full of<br>
 God's wisdom <b><i>(<!-#-->2:7)</i></b> under the impulse of the Spirit of God. This<br>
 gift is placed first <b><i>(revelation by the Spirit)</i></b>. <B>{The word of<br>
 knowledge}</B> <b><i>(\logos gn&#333;se&#333;s\)</i></b>. This gift is insight <b><i>(illumination)</i></b><br>
 according to <b><i>(\kata\)</i></b> the same Spirit.<br>
 <br>
 12:9 <B>{Faith}</B> <b><i>(\pistis\)</i></b>. Not faith of surrender, saving faith,<br>
 but wonder-working faith like that in <!-#-->13:2 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 17:20; 21:21)</i></b>.<br>
 Note here \en t&#333;i aut&#333;i pneumati\ <b><i>(in the same Spirit)</i></b> in<br>
 contrast with \dia\ and \kata\ in verse <!-#-->8. <B>{Gifts of healings}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\charismata iamat&#333;n\)</i></b>. \Iama\, old word from \iaomai\, common in<br>
 LXX, in N.T. only in this chapter. It means acts of healing as in<br>
 <!-#-->Ac 4:30 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Jas 5:14)</i></b> and <!-#-->Lu 7:21 <b><i>(of Jesus)</i></b>. Note \en\<br>
 here as just before.<br>
 <br>
 12:10 <B>{Workings of miracles}</B> <b><i>(\energ&#275;mata duname&#333;n\)</i></b>. Workings of<br>
 powers. Cf. \energ&#333;n dunameis\ in <!-#-->Ga 3:5; Heb 2:4 where all<br>
 three words are used <b><i>(\s&#275;meia\, signs, \terata\, wonders,<br>
 \dunameis\, powers)</i></b>. Some of the miracles were not healings as<br>
 the blindness on Elymas the sorcerer. <B>{Prophecy}</B> <b><i>(\proph&#275;teia\)</i></b>.<br>
 Late word from \proph&#275;t&#275;s\ and \proph&#275;mi\, to speak forth. Common<br>
 in papyri. This gift Paul will praise most <b><i>(chapter <!-#-->1Co 14)</i></b>.<br>
 Not always prediction, but a speaking forth of God's message<br>
 under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. <B>{Discernings of spirits}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\diakriseis pneumat&#333;n\)</i></b>. \Diakrisis\ is old word from \diakrin&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(see <!-#-->11:29)</i></b> and in N.T. only here; <!-#-->Ro 14:1; Heb 5:14. A most<br>
 needed gift to tell whether the gifts were really of the Holy<br>
 Spirit and supernatural <b><i>(cf. so-called "gifts" today)</i></b> or merely<br>
 strange though natural or even diabolical <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 4:1; 1Jo 4:1f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Divers kinds of tongues}</B> <b><i>(\gen&#275; gl&#333;ss&#333;n\)</i></b>. No word for "divers"<br>
 in the Greek. There has arisen a great deal of confusion<br>
 concerning the gift of tongues as found in Corinth. They prided<br>
 themselves chiefly on this gift which had become a source of<br>
 confusion and disorder. There were varieties <b><i>(kinds, \gen&#275;\)</i></b> in<br>
 this gift, but the gift was essentially an ecstatic utterance of<br>
 highly wrought emotion that edified the speaker <b><i>(<!-#-->14:4)</i></b> and was<br>
 intelligible to God <b><i>(<!-#-->14:2,28)</i></b>. It was not always true that the<br>
 speaker in tongues could make clear what he had said to those who<br>
 did not know the tongue <b><i>(<!-#-->14:13)</i></b>: It was not mere gibberish or<br>
 jargon like the modern "tongues," but in a real language that<br>
 could be understood by one familiar with that tongue as was seen<br>
 on the great Day of Pentecost when people who spoke different<br>
 languages were present. In Corinth, where no such variety of<br>
 people existed, it required an interpreter to explain the tongue<br>
 to those who knew it not. Hence Paul placed this gift lowest of<br>
 all. It created wonder, but did little real good. This is the<br>
 error of the Irvingites and others who have tried to reproduce<br>
 this early gift of the Holy Spirit which was clearly for a<br>
 special emergency and which was not designed to help spread the<br>
 gospel among men. See on &#175;Ac 2:13-21; 10:44-46; 19:6. <B>{The<br>
 interpretation of tongues}</B> <b><i>(\herm&#275;neia gl&#333;ss&#333;n\)</i></b>. Old word, here<br>
 only and <!-#-->14:26 in N.T., from \herm&#275;neu&#333;\ from \Herm&#275;s\ <b><i>(the god<br>
 of speech)</i></b>. Cf. on \dierm&#275;neu&#333;\ in <!-#-->Lu 24:27; Ac 9:36. In case<br>
 there was no one present who understood the particular tongue it<br>
 required a special gift of the Spirit to some one to interpret it<br>
 if any one was to receive benefit from it.<br>
 <br>
 12:11 <B>{Worketh}</B> <b><i>(\energei\)</i></b>. The same word that was used in verse<br>
 <!-#-->6 of God. <B>{Severally}</B> <b><i>(\idi&#257;i\)</i></b>. Separately. <B>{Even as he will}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kath&#333;s bouletai\)</i></b>. Hence there is no occasion for conceit,<br>
 pride, or faction <b><i>(<!-#-->4:7)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:12 <B>{So also is Christ}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s kai ho Christos\)</i></b>. One would<br>
 naturally expect Paul here to say \hout&#333;s kai to s&#333;ma tou<br>
 Christou\ <b><i>(so also is the body of Christ)</i></b>. He will later call<br>
 Christ the Head of the Body the Church as in <!-#-->Col 1:18,24; Eph<br>
 5:23,30. Aristotle had used \s&#333;ma\ of the state as the body<br>
 politic. What Paul here means is Christ as the Head of the Church<br>
 has a body composed of the members who have varied gifts and<br>
 functions like the different members of the human body. They are<br>
 all vitally connected with the Head of the body and with each<br>
 other. This idea he now elaborates in a remarkable manner.<br>
 <br>
 12:13 <B>{Were we all baptized into one body}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meis pantes eis<br>
 hen s&#333;ma ebaptisth&#275;men\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of<br>
 \baptiz&#333;\ and so a reference to a definite past event with each<br>
 of them of different races, nations, classes, when each of them<br>
 put on the outward badge of service to Christ, the symbol of the<br>
 inward changes already wrought in them by the Holy Spirit <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga<br>
 3:27; Ro 6:2ff.)</i></b>. <B>{And were all made to drink of one Spirit}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai pantes hen pneuma epotisth&#275;men\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative of \potiz&#333;\, old verb, to give to drink. The<br>
 accusative \hen pneuma\ is retained in the passive as often with<br>
 verbs that in the active take two accusatives. The reference is<br>
 to a definite act in the past, probably to the inward experience<br>
 of the Holy Spirit symbolized by the act of baptism.<br>
 <br>
 12:14 <B>{Is not one member}</B> <b><i>(\ouk estin hen melos\)</i></b>. The point<br>
 sounds like a truism, but it is the key to the whole problem of<br>
 church life both local and general. Vincent refers to the fable<br>
 of the body and the members by Menenius Agrippa <b><i>(Livy, II, 32)</i></b>,<br>
 but it was an old parable. Socrates pointed out how absurd it<br>
 would be if feet and hands should work against one another when<br>
 God made them to cooperate <b><i>(Xen., _Mem_. II. iii. 18)</i></b>. Seneca<br>
 alludes to it as does Marcus Aurelius and Marcus Antoninus.<br>
 <br>
 12:15 <B>{If the foot shall say}</B> <b><i>(\ean eip&#275;i ho pous\)</i></b>. Condition of<br>
 third class <b><i>(\ean\ and second aorist subjunctive \eip&#275;i\)</i></b>. In<br>
 case the foot say. <B>{I am not of the body}</B> <b><i>(\ouk eimi ek tou<br>
 s&#333;matos\)</i></b>. I am independent of the body, not dependent on the<br>
 body. <B>{It is not therefore not of the body}</B> <b><i>(\ou para touto ouk<br>
 estin ek tou s&#333;matos\)</i></b>. Thinking or saying so does not change the<br>
 fact. \Para touto\ here means "alongside of this" <b><i>(cf. IV Macc.<br>
 10:19)</i></b> and so "because of," a rare use <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 616)</i></b>. The two negatives <b><i>(\ou--ouk\)</i></b> do not here destroy one<br>
 another. Each retains its full force.<br>
 <br>
 12:16 Points explained precisely as in verse <!-#-->15.<br>
 <br>
 12:17 <B>{If the whole body were an eye}</B> <b><i>(\ei holon to s&#333;ma<br>
 ophthalmos\)</i></b>. The eye is the most wonderful organ and supremely<br>
 useful <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 10:31)</i></b>, the very light of the body <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 11:34)</i></b>. And<br>
 yet how grotesque it would be if there were nothing else but a<br>
 great round rolling eye! A big "I" surely! <B>{The smelling}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;<br>
 osphr&#275;sis\)</i></b>. Old word from \osphrainomai\, to smell. Here alone<br>
 in N.T.<br>
 <br>
 12:18 <B>{But now}</B> <b><i>(\nun de\)</i></b>. But as things are, in contrast to<br>
 that absurdity. <B>{Hath God set}</B> <b><i>(\ho theos etheto\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 middle indicative. God did it and of himself. <B>{Even as it pleased<br>
 him}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s &#275;thel&#275;sen\)</i></b>. Why challenge God's will? Cf. <!-#-->Ro<br>
 9:20.<br>
 <br>
 12:19 <B>{One member}</B> <b><i>(\hen melos\)</i></b>. Paul applies the logic of verse<br>
 <!-#-->17 to any member of the body. The application to members of the<br>
 church is obvious. It is particularly pertinent in the case of a<br>
 "church boss."<br>
 <br>
 12:20 <B>{Many members, but one body}</B> <b><i>(\polla mel&#275;, hen de s&#333;ma\)</i></b>.<br>
 The argument in a nutshell, in one epigram.<br>
 <br>
 12:21 <B>{Cannot say}</B> <b><i>(\ou dunatai eipein\)</i></b>. And be truthful. The<br>
 superior organs need the inferior ones <b><i>(the eye, the hand, the<br>
 head, the feet)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:22 <B>{Nay, much rather}</B> <b><i>(\alla poll&#333;i mallon\)</i></b>. Adversative<br>
 sense of \alla\, on the contrary. So far from the more dignified<br>
 members like the eye and the head being independent of the<br>
 subordinate ones like the hands and feet, they are "much more"<br>
 <b><i>(_argumentum a fortiori_, "by much more" \poll&#333;i mallon\,<br>
 instrumental case)</i></b> in need of therm. <B>{Those members of the body<br>
 which seem to be more feeble are necessary}</B> <b><i>(\ta dokounta mel&#275;<br>
 tou s&#333;matos asthenestera huparchein anagkaia estin\)</i></b>. Things are<br>
 not always what they seem. The vital organs <b><i>(heart, lungs, liver,<br>
 kidneys)</i></b> are not visible, but life cannot exist without them.<br>
 <br>
 12:23 <B>{We bestow}</B> <b><i>(\peritithemen\)</i></b>. Literally, We place around as<br>
 if a garland <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 15:17)</i></b> or a garment <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:28)</i></b>. <B>{More<br>
 abundant comeliness}</B> <b><i>(\eusch&#275;mosun&#275;n perissoteran\)</i></b>. One need<br>
 only mention the mother's womb and the mother's breast to see the<br>
 force of Paul's argument here. The word, common in old Greek,<br>
 from \eusch&#275;m&#333;n\ <b><i>(\eu\, well, \sch&#275;ma\, figure)</i></b>, here only in<br>
 N.T. One may think of the coal-miner who digs under the earth for<br>
 the coal to keep us warm in winter. So \asch&#275;m&#333;n\ <b><i>(deformed,<br>
 uncomely)</i></b>, old word, here only in N.T., but see <!-#-->7:36 for<br>
 \asch&#275;mone&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 12:24 <B>{Tempered the body together}</B> <b><i>(\sunekerasen to s&#333;ma\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active indicative of \sunkerannumi\, to mix together, old<br>
 word, but in N.T. only here and <!-#-->Heb 4:2. Plato used this very<br>
 word of the way God compounded <b><i>(\sunekerasato\)</i></b> the various<br>
 elements of the body in creating soul and body. Paul rejects the<br>
 idea of the later Gnostics that matter is evil and the physical<br>
 organs degrading. He gives a noble picture of the body with its<br>
 wonderful organs planned to be the temple of God's Spirit<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->6:19)</i></b> in opposition to the Epicurean sensualists in Corinth.<br>
 <B>{To that part which lacked}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i husteroumen&#333;i\)</i></b>. It is a true<br>
 instinct that gives superior honour to the unseen organs of life.<br>
 <br>
 12:25 <B>{That there should be no schism}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275; &#275;i schisma\)</i></b>.<br>
 Purpose of God in his plan for the body. Trouble in one organ<br>
 affects the whole body. A headache may be due to trouble<br>
 elsewhere and usually is. <B>{Have the same care}</B> <b><i>(\to auto<br>
 merimn&#333;sin\)</i></b>. The very verb \merimna&#333;\ used by Jesus of our<br>
 anxiety <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 6:27,31)</i></b>. Paul here personifies the parts of the<br>
 body as if each one is anxious for the others. The modern<br>
 knowledge of the billions of cells in the body co-working for the<br>
 whole confirms Paul's argument.<br>
 <br>
 12:26 <B>{Suffer with it}</B> <b><i>(\sunpaschei\)</i></b>. Medical term in this sense<br>
 in Hippocrates and Galen. In N.T only here and <!-#-->Ro 8:17 <b><i>(of our<br>
 suffering with Christ)</i></b>. One of Solon's Laws allowed retaliation<br>
 by any one for another's injuries. Plato <b><i>(_Republic_, V, 462)</i></b><br>
 says the body politic "feels the hurt" as the whole body feels a<br>
 hurt finger. <B>{Rejoice with it}</B> <b><i>(\sunchairei\)</i></b>. This is<br>
 fortunately true also. One may tingle with joy all over the body<br>
 thanks to the wonderful nervous system and to the relation<br>
 between mind and matter. See <!-#-->13:6 for joy of love with truth.<br>
 <br>
 12:27 <B>{Severally}</B> <b><i>(\ek merous\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ro 11:25 \apo merous\ <b><i>(in<br>
 part)</i></b>. Each has his own place and function in the body of Christ.<br>
 <br>
 12:28 <B>{God hath set some}</B> <b><i>(\hous men etheto ho theos\)</i></b>. See verse<br>
 <!-#-->18 for \etheto ho theos\. Note middle voice <b><i>(for his own use)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul begins as if he means to say \hous men apostolous, hous de<br>
 proph&#275;tas\ <b><i>(some apostles, some prophets)</i></b>, but he changes the<br>
 construction and has no \hous de\, but instead \pr&#333;ton, deuteron,<br>
 epeita\ <b><i>(first, second, then, etc.)</i></b>. <B>{In the church}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i<br>
 ekkl&#275;si&#257;i\)</i></b>. The general sense of \ekkl&#275;sia\ as in <!-#-->Mt 16:18 and<br>
 later in <!-#-->Col 1:18,24; Eph 5:23,32; Heb 12:23. See list also in<br>
 <!-#-->Eph 4:11. See on &#175;Mt 10:2 for \apostolous\, the official title<br>
 given the twelve by Jesus, and claimed by Paul though not one of<br>
 the twelve. <B>{Prophets}</B> <b><i>(\proph&#275;tas\)</i></b>. For-speakers for God and<br>
 Christ. See the list of prophets and teachers in <!-#-->Ac 13:1 with<br>
 Barnabas first and Saul last. Prophets are needed today if men<br>
 will let God's Spirit use them, men moved to utter the deep<br>
 things of God. <B>{Teachers}</B> <b><i>(\didaskalous\)</i></b>. Old word from<br>
 \didask&#333;\, to teach. Used to the Baptist <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 3:12)</i></b>, to Jesus<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 3:10; 13:13)</i></b>, and of Paul by himself along with<br>
 \apostolos\ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 2:7)</i></b>. It is a calamity when the preacher is no<br>
 longer a teacher, but only an exhorter. See <!-#-->Eph 4:11. <B>{Then<br>
 miracles}</B> <b><i>(\epeita dunameis\)</i></b>. Here a change is made from the<br>
 concrete to the abstract. See the reverse in <!-#-->Ro 12:7. See these<br>
 words <b><i>(\dunameis, iam&#275;t&#333;n, gl&#333;ss&#333;n\)</i></b> in verses <!-#-->9,10 with<br>
 \gl&#333;ss&#333;n\, last again. But these two new terms <b><i>(helps,<br>
 governments)</i></b>. <B>{Helps}</B> <b><i>(\antil&#275;mpseis\)</i></b>. Old word, from<br>
 \antilambanomai\, to lay hold of. In LXX, common in papyri, here<br>
 only in N.T. Probably refers to the work of the deacons, help<br>
 rendered to the poor and the sick. <B>{Governments}</B> <b><i>(\kubern&#275;seis\)</i></b>.<br>
 Old word from \kuberna&#333;\ <b><i>(cf. \Kubern&#275;t&#275;s\ in <!-#-->Ac 27:11)</i></b> like<br>
 Latin _gubernare_, our govern. So a governing. Probably Paul has<br>
 in mind bishops <b><i>(\episcopoi\)</i></b> or elders <b><i>(\presbuteroi\)</i></b>, the<br>
 outstanding leaders <b><i>(\hoi proistamenoi\ in <!-#-->1Th 5:12; Ro 12:8;<br>
 \hoi h&#275;goumenoi\ in <!-#-->Ac 15:22; Heb 13:7,17,24)</i></b>. Curiously<br>
 enough, these two offices <b><i>(pastors and deacons)</i></b> which are not<br>
 named specifically are the two that survive today. See <!-#-->Php 1:1<br>
 for both officers.<br>
 <br>
 12:29 <B>{Are all}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; pantes\)</i></b>. The \m&#275;\ expects a negative answer<br>
 with each group.<br>
 <br>
 12:30 <B>{Do all interpret?}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; pantes dierm&#275;neuousin?\)</i></b>. He adds<br>
 this query to the list in <!-#-->28, but it is in <!-#-->10.<br>
 <br>
 12:31 <B>{The greater gifts}</B> <b><i>(\ta charismata ta meizona\)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 unhesitatingly ranks some spiritual gifts above others. \Z&#275;lo&#333;\<br>
 here has good sense, not that of envy as in <!-#-->Ac 7:9; 1Co 13:4.<br>
 <B>{And a still more excellent way}</B> <b><i>(\kai eti kath' huperbol&#275;n<br>
 hodon\)</i></b>. In order to gain the greater gifts. "I show you a way<br>
 _par excellence_," beyond all comparison <b><i>(superlative idea in<br>
 this adjunct, not comparative)</i></b>, like \kath' huperbol&#275;n eis<br>
 huperbol&#275;n\ <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 4:17)</i></b>. \Huperbol&#275;\ is old word from<br>
 \huperball&#333;\, to throw beyond, to surpass, to excel <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 3:10;<br>
 Eph 1:19)</i></b>. "I show you a supremely excellent way." Chapter <!-#-->1Co<br>
 13 is this way, the way of love already laid down in <!-#-->8:1<br>
 concerning the question of meats offered to idols <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1Jo<br>
 4:7)</i></b>. Poor division of chapters here. This verse belongs with<br>
 chapter <!-#-->1Co 13.<br>
