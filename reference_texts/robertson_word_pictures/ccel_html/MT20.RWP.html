<p>20:1 <B>{For}</B> <b><i>(\gar\)</i></b>. The parable of the house illustrates the<br>
 aphorism in <!-#-->19:30. <B>{A man that is a householder}</B> <b><i>(\anthr&#333;p&#333;i<br>
 oikodespot&#275;i\)</i></b>. Just like \anthr&#333;p&#333;i basilei\ <b><i>(<!-#-->18:23)</i></b>. Not<br>
 necessary to translate \anthr&#333;p&#333;i\, just "a householder."<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Early in the morning}</B> <b><i>(\hama pr&#333;i\)</i></b>. A classic idiom. \Hama\ as<br>
 an "improper" preposition is common in the papyri. \Pr&#333;i\ is just<br>
 an adverb in the locative. At the same time with early dawn,<br>
 break of day, country fashion for starting to work. <B>{To hire}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\misth&#333;sasthai\)</i></b>. The middle voice aorist tense, to hire for<br>
 oneself.<br>
 <br>
 20:2 <B>{For a penny a day}</B> <b><i>(\ek d&#275;nariou t&#275;n h&#275;meran\)</i></b>. See on<br>
 &#175;18:28. "Penny" is not adequate, "shilling" Moffatt has it. The<br>
 \ek\ with the ablative represents the agreement <b><i>(\sunph&#333;n&#275;sas\)</i></b><br>
 with the workmen <b><i>(\ergat&#333;n\)</i></b>. "The day" the Greek has it, an<br>
 accusative of extent of time.<br>
 <br>
 20:3 <B>{Standing in the marketplace idle}</B> <b><i>(\hest&#333;tas agor&#257;i<br>
 argous\)</i></b>. The market place was the place where men and masters<br>
 met for bargaining. At Hamadan in Persia, Morier in _Second<br>
 Journey through Persia_, as cited by Trench in his _Parables_,<br>
 says: "We observed every morning, before the sun rose, that a<br>
 numerous band of peasants were collected, with spades in their<br>
 hands, waiting to be hired for the day to work in the surrounding<br>
 fields."<br>
 <br>
 20:4 <B>{Whatsoever is right}</B> <b><i>(\ho ean &#275;i dikaion\)</i></b>. "Is fair"<br>
 <b><i>(Allen)</i></b>, not anything he pleased, but a just proportionate wage.<br>
 Indefinite relative with subjunctive \ean=an\.<br>
 <br>
 20:6 <B>{All the day idle}</B> <b><i>(\hol&#275;n t&#275;n h&#275;meran argoi\)</i></b>. Extent of<br>
 time <b><i>(accusative)</i></b> again. \Argoi\ is \a\ privative and \ergon\,<br>
 work, no work. The problem of the unemployed.<br>
 <br>
 20:10 <B>{Every man a penny}</B> <b><i>(\ana d&#275;narion kai autoi\)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 "themselves also a denarius apiece" <b><i>(distributive use of \ana\)</i></b>.<br>
 Bruce asks if this householder was a humorist when he began to<br>
 pay off the last first and paid each one a denarius according to<br>
 agreement. False hopes had been raised in those who came first<br>
 who got only what they had agreed to receive.<br>
 <br>
 20:11 <B>{They murmured}</B> <b><i>(\egogguzon\)</i></b>. Onomatopoetic word, the<br>
 meaning suiting the sound. Our words murmur and grumble are<br>
 similar. Probably here inchoative imperfect, began to grumble. It<br>
 occurs in old Ionic and in the papyri.<br>
 <br>
 20:12 <B>{Equal unto us}</B> <b><i>(\isous autous h&#275;min\)</i></b>. Associative<br>
 instrumental case \h&#275;min\ after \isous\. It was a regular protest<br>
 against the supposed injustice of the householder. <B>{The burden of<br>
 the day and the scorching wind}</B> <b><i>(\to baros t&#275;s h&#275;meras kai ton<br>
 kaus&#333;na\)</i></b>. These last "did" work for one hour. Apparently they<br>
 worked as hard as any while at it. A whole day's work on the part<br>
 of these sweat-stained men who had stood also the sirocco, the<br>
 hot, dry, dust-laden east wind that blasted the grain in<br>
 Pharaoh's dream <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 41:6)</i></b>, that withered Jonah's gourd <b><i>(<!-#-->Jon<br>
 4:8)</i></b>, that blighted the vine in Ezekiel's parable <b><i>(<!-#-->Eze 17:10)</i></b>.<br>
 They seemed to have a good case.<br>
 <br>
 20:13 <B>{To one of them}</B> <b><i>(\heni aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Evidently the spokesman of<br>
 the group. "Friend" <b><i>(\hetaire\)</i></b>. Comrade. So a kindly reply to<br>
 this man in place of an address to the whole gang. <!-#-->Ge 31:40; Job<br>
 27:21; Ho 13:15. The word survives in modern Greek.<br>
 <br>
 20:14 <B>{Take up}</B> <b><i>(\aron\)</i></b>. First aorist active imperative of<br>
 \air&#333;\. Pick up, as if he had saucily refused to take it from the<br>
 table or had contemptuously thrown the denarius on the ground. If<br>
 the first had been paid first and sent away, there would probably<br>
 have been no murmuring, but "the murmuring is needed to bring out<br>
 the lesson" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. The \d&#275;narius\ was the common wage of a<br>
 day labourer at that time. <B>{What I will}</B> <b><i>(\ho thel&#333;\)</i></b>. This is<br>
 the point of the parable, the _will_ of the householder. <B>{With<br>
 mine own}</B> <b><i>(\en tois emois\)</i></b>. In the sphere of my own affairs.<br>
 There is in the _Koin&#275;_ an extension of the instrumental use of<br>
 \en\.<br>
 <br>
 20:15 <B>{Is thine eye evil?}</B> <b><i>(\ho ophthalmos sou pon&#275;ros estin?\)</i></b><br>
 See on &#175;6:22-24 about the evil eye and the good eye. The<br>
 complainer had a grudging eye while the householder has a liberal<br>
 or generous eye. See <!-#-->Ro 5:7 for a distinction between \dikaios\<br>
 and \agathos\.<br>
 <br>
 20:16 <B>{The last first and the first last}</B> <b><i>(\hoi esch&#257;toi pr&#333;toi<br>
 kai hoi pr&#333;toi eschatoi\)</i></b>. The adjectives change places as<br>
 compared with <!-#-->19:30. The point is the same, though this order<br>
 suits the parable better. After all one's work does not rest<br>
 wholly on the amount of time spent on it. "Even so hath Rabbi Bun<br>
 bar Chija in twenty-eight years wrought more than many studious<br>
 scholars in a hundred years" <b><i>(Jer. _Berak._ ii. 5c)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 20:17 <B>{Apart}</B> <b><i>(\kat' idian\)</i></b>. This is the prediction in Matthew<br>
 of the cross <b><i>(<!-#-->16:21; 17:22; 20:17)</i></b>. "Aside by themselves"<br>
 <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>. The verb is \parelaben\. Jesus is having his inward<br>
 struggle <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 10:32)</i></b> and makes one more effort to get the Twelve<br>
 to understand him.<br>
 <br>
 20:19 <B>{And to crucify}</B> <b><i>(\kai staur&#333;sai\)</i></b>. The very word now. The<br>
 details fall on deaf ears, even the point of the resurrection on<br>
 the third day.<br>
 <br>
 20:20 <B>{Then}</B> <b><i>(\tote\)</i></b>. Surely an inopportune time for such a<br>
 request just after the pointed prediction of Christ's<br>
 crucifixion. Perhaps their minds had been preoccupied with the<br>
 words of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->19:28)</i></b> about their sitting on twelve thrones<br>
 taking them in a literal sense. The mother of James and John,<br>
 probably Salome, possibly a sister of the Master's mother <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 19:25)</i></b>, apparently prompted her two sons because of the family<br>
 relationship and now speaks for them. <B>{Asking a certain thing}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aitousa ti\)</i></b>. "Asking something," "plotting perhaps when their<br>
 Master was predicting" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. The "something" put forward as a<br>
 small matter was simply the choice of the two chief thrones<br>
 promised by Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->19:28)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 20:22 <B>{Ye know not what ye ask}</B> <b><i>(\ouk oidate ti aiteisthe\)</i></b>. How<br>
 often that is true. \Aiteisthe\ is indirect middle voice, "ask<br>
 for yourselves," "a selfish request." <B>{We are able}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dunametha\)</i></b>. Amazing proof of their ignorance and<br>
 self-confidence. Ambition had blinded their eyes. They had not<br>
 caught the martyr spirit.<br>
 <br>
 20:23 <B>{Ye shall drink}</B> <b><i>(\piesthe\)</i></b>. Future middle from \pin&#333;\.<br>
 Christ's cup was martyrdom. James was the first of the Twelve to<br>
 meet the martyr's death <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 12:2)</i></b> and John the last if reports<br>
 are true about him. How little they knew what they were saying.<br>
 <br>
 20:24 <B>{Moved with indignation}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;ganakt&#275;san\)</i></b>. A strong word for<br>
 angry resentment. In the papyri. The ten felt that James and John<br>
 had taken advantage of their relation to Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 20:25 <B>{Called them unto him}</B> <b><i>(\proskalesamenos autous\)</i></b>. Indirect<br>
 middle again, calling to him.<br>
 <br>
 20:26 <B>{Would become great}</B> <b><i>(\hos an thel&#275;i megas genesthai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Jesus does not condemn the desire to become great. It is a<br>
 laudable ambition. There are "great ones" <b><i>(\megaloi\)</i></b> among<br>
 Christians as among pagans, but they do not "lord it over" one<br>
 another <b><i>(\katakurieuousin\)</i></b>, a LXX word and very expressive, or<br>
 "play the tyrant" <b><i>(\katexousiazousin\)</i></b>, another suggestive word.<br>
 <B>{Your minister}</B> <b><i>(\h&#8211;m&#333;n diakonos\)</i></b>. This word may come from \dia\<br>
 and \konis\ <b><i>(dust)</i></b>, to raise a dust by one's hurry, and so to<br>
 minister. It is a general word for servant and is used in a<br>
 variety of ways including the technical sense of our "deacon" in<br>
 <!-#-->Php. 1:1. But it more frequently is applied to ministers of the<br>
 Gospel <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 3:5)</i></b>. The way to be "first" <b><i>(\pr&#333;tos\)</i></b>, says Jesus,<br>
 is to be your "servant" <b><i>(\doulos\)</i></b>, "bond-servant" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->27)</i></b>.<br>
 This is a complete reversal of popular opinion then and now.<br>
 <br>
 20:28 <B>{A ransom for many}</B> <b><i>(\lutron anti poll&#333;n\)</i></b>. The Son of man<br>
 is the outstanding illustration of this principle of<br>
 self-abnegation in direct contrast to the self-seeking of James<br>
 and John. The word translated "ransom" is the one commonly<br>
 employed in the papyri as the price paid for a slave who is then<br>
 set free by the one who bought him, the purchase money for<br>
 manumitting slaves. See examples in Moulton and Milligan's<br>
 _Vocabulary_ and Deissmann's _Light from the Ancient East_, pp.<br>
 328f. There is the notion of exchange also in the use of \anti\.<br>
 Jesus gave his own life as the price of freedom for the slaves of<br>
 sin. There are those who refuse to admit that Jesus held this<br>
 notion of a substitutionary death because the word in the N.T.<br>
 occurs only here and the corresponding passage in <!-#-->Mr 10:45. But<br>
 that is an easy way to get rid of passages that contradict one's<br>
 theological opinions. Jesus here rises to the full consciousness<br>
 of the significance of his death for men.<br>
 <br>
 20:29 <B>{From Jericho}</B> <b><i>(\apo Iereich&#333;\)</i></b>. So <!-#-->Mr 10:46. But Luke<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 18:35)</i></b> places the incident as they were drawing near to<br>
 Jericho <b><i>(\eis Iereich&#333;\)</i></b>. It is probable that Mark and Matthew<br>
 refer to the old Jericho, the ruins of which have been<br>
 discovered, while Luke alludes to the new Roman Jericho. The two<br>
 blind men were apparently between the two towns. Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 10:46)</i></b> and Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 18:35)</i></b> mention only one blind man,<br>
 Bartimaeus <b><i>(Mark)</i></b>. In Kentucky there are two towns about a half<br>
 mile apart both called Pleasureville <b><i>(one Old Pleasureville, the<br>
 other New Pleasureville)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 20:30 <B>{That Jesus was passing by}</B> <b><i>(\hoti I&#275;sous paragei\)</i></b>. These<br>
 men "were sitting by the wayside" <b><i>(\kath&#275;menoi para ten hodon\)</i></b><br>
 at their regular stand. They heard the crowd yelling that Jesus<br>
 of Nazareth was passing by <b><i>(\paragei\, present indicative of<br>
 direct discourse retained in the indirect)</i></b>. It was their one<br>
 opportunity, now or never. They had heard of what he had done for<br>
 other blind men. They hail him as "the son of David" <b><i>(the<br>
 Messiah)</i></b>. It is just one of many such incidents when Jesus stood<br>
 still and opened their eyes, so many that even the multitude was<br>
 impatient with the cries of these poor men that their eyes be<br>
 opened <b><i>(\anoig&#333;sin\, second aorist passive subjunctive)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 20:34 <B>{Touched their eyes}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;psato t&#333;n ommat&#333;n\)</i></b>. A synonym for<br>
 \ophthalm&#333;n\ in <!-#-->Mr 8:23 and here alone in the N.T. In the LXX<br>
 and a common poetic word <b><i>(Euripides)</i></b> and occurs in the papyri. In<br>
 modern Greek \matia mou\ <b><i>(abbreviation)</i></b> means "light of my eye,"<br>
 "my darling." The verb \haptomai\ is very common in the Synoptic<br>
 Gospels. The touch of Christ's hand would sooth the eyes as they<br>
 were healed.<br>
