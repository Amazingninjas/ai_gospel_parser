<p>4:1 <B>{Full of the Holy Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;r&#275;s pneumatos hagiou\)</i></b>. An<br>
 evident allusion to the descent of the Holy Spirit on Jesus at<br>
 his baptism <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 3:21f.)</i></b>. The distinctness of the Persons in the<br>
 Trinity is shown there, but with evident unity. One recalls also<br>
 Luke's account of the overshadowing of Mary by the Holy Spirit<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1:35)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 4:1 says that "Jesus was led of the Spirit" while<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 1:12 states that "the Spirit driveth him forth" which see<br>
 for discussion. "Jesus had been endowed with supernatural power;<br>
 and He was tempted to make use of it in furthering his own<br>
 interests without regard to the Father's will" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{Was<br>
 led by the Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;geto en toi pneumati\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive,<br>
 continuously led. \En\ may be the instrumental use as often, for<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 4:1 has here \hupo\ of direct agency. But Matthew has the<br>
 aorist passive \an&#275;chth&#275;\ which may be ingressive as he has \eis<br>
 t&#275;n er&#275;mon\ <b><i>(into the wilderness)</i></b> while Luke has \en t&#333;i er&#275;m&#333;i\<br>
 <b><i>(in the wilderness)</i></b>. At any rate Luke affirms that Jesus was now<br>
 continuously under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Hence in this<br>
 same sentence he mentions the Spirit twice. <B>{During the forty<br>
 days}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;mer&#257;s tesserakonta\)</i></b>. Accusative of duration of time,<br>
 to be connected with "led" not with "tempted." He was led in the<br>
 Spirit during these forty days <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->De 8:2, forty years)</i></b>. The<br>
 words are amphibolous also in <!-#-->Mr 1:13. <!-#-->Mt 4:2 seems to imply<br>
 that the three recorded temptations came at the close of the<br>
 fasting for forty days. That can be true and yet what Luke states<br>
 be true also. These three may be merely specimens and so<br>
 "representative of the struggle which continued throughout the<br>
 whole period" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:2 <B>{Being tempted}</B> <b><i>(\peirazomenos\)</i></b>. Present passive participle<br>
 and naturally parallel with the imperfect passive \&#275;geto\ <b><i>(was<br>
 led)</i></b> in verse <!-#-->1. This is another instance of poor verse<br>
 division which should have come at the end of the sentence. See<br>
 on &#175;Mt 4:1; Mr 1:13 for the words "tempt" and "devil." The devil<br>
 challenged the Son of man though also the Son of God. It was a<br>
 contest between Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, and the slanderer<br>
 of men. The devil had won with Adam and Eve. He has hopes of<br>
 triumph over Jesus. The story of this conflict is given only in<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 4:1-11; Lu 4:1-13. There is a mere mention of it in <!-#-->Mr<br>
 1:12f. So then here is a specimen of the Logia of Jesus <b><i>(Q)</i></b>, a<br>
 non-Markan portion of Matthew and Luke, the earliest document<br>
 about Christ. The narrative could come ultimately only from<br>
 Christ himself. It is noteworthy that it bears all the marks of<br>
 the high conception of Jesus as the Son of God found in the<br>
 Gospel of John and in Paul and Hebrews, the rest of the New<br>
 Testament in fact, for Mark, Matthew, Luke, Acts, Peter, and Jude<br>
 follow in this same strain. The point is that modern criticism<br>
 has revealed the Messianic consciousness of Jesus as God's Son at<br>
 his Baptism and in his Temptations at the very beginning of his<br>
 ministry and in the oldest known documents about Christ <b><i>(The<br>
 Logia, Mark's Gospel)</i></b>. <B>{He did eat nothing}</B> <b><i>(\ouk ephagen<br>
 ouden\)</i></b>. Second aorist <b><i>(constative)</i></b> active indicative of the<br>
 defective verb \esthi&#333;\. Mark does not give the fast. <!-#-->Mt 4:2<br>
 has the aorist active participle \n&#275;steusas\ which usually means<br>
 a religious fast for purposes of devotion. That idea is not<br>
 excluded by Luke's words. The entrance of Jesus upon his<br>
 Messianic ministry was a fit time for this solemn and intense<br>
 consecration. This mental and spiritual strain would naturally<br>
 take away the appetite and there was probably nothing at hand to<br>
 eat. The weakness from the absence of food gave the devil his<br>
 special opportunity to tempt Jesus which he promptly seized.<br>
 <B>{When they were completed}</B> <b><i>(\suntelestheis&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute with the first aorist passive participle feminine plural<br>
 because \hemer&#333;n\ <b><i>(days)</i></b> is feminine. According to Luke the<br>
 hunger <b><i>(\epeinasen\, became hungry, ingressive aorist active<br>
 indicative)</i></b> came at the close of the forty days as in <!-#-->Mt 4:2.<br>
 <br>
 4:3 <B>{The Son of God}</B> <b><i>(\huios tou theou\)</i></b>. No article as in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 4:3. So refers to the relationship as Son of God rather than to<br>
 the office of Messiah. Manifest reference to the words of the<br>
 Father in <!-#-->Lu 3:22. Condition of the first class as in Matthew.<br>
 The devil assumes that Jesus is Son of God. <B>{This stone}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i<br>
 lith&#333;i tout&#333;i\)</i></b>. Perhaps pointing to a particular round stone<br>
 that looked in shape and size like a loaf of bread. Stanley<br>
 <b><i>(_Sinai and Palestine_, p. 154)</i></b> on Mt. Carmel found<br>
 crystallizations of stones called "Elijah's melons." The hunger<br>
 of Jesus opened the way for the diabolic suggestion designed to<br>
 inspire doubt in Jesus toward his Father. Matthew has "these<br>
 stones." <B>{Bread}</B> <b><i>(\artos\)</i></b>. Better "loaf." For discussion of this<br>
 first temptation see on &#175;Mt 4:3f. Jesus felt the force of each<br>
 of the temptations without yielding at all to the sin involved.<br>
 See discussion on Matthew also for reality of the devil and the<br>
 objective and subjective elements in the temptations. Jesus<br>
 quotes <!-#-->De 8:3 in reply to the devil.<br>
 <br>
 4:5 <B>{The world}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;s oikoumen&#275;s\)</i></b>. The inhabited world. In <!-#-->Mt<br>
 4:8 it is \tou kosmou\. <B>{In a moment of time}</B> <b><i>(\en stigm&#275;i<br>
 chronou\)</i></b>. Only in Luke and the word \stigm&#275;\ nowhere else in the<br>
 N.T. <b><i>(from \stiz&#333;\, to prick, or puncture)</i></b>, a point or dot. In<br>
 Demosthenes, Aristotle, Plutarch. Like our "second" of time or<br>
 tick of the clock. This panorama of all the kingdoms of the world<br>
 and the glory of them in a moment of time was mental, a great<br>
 feat of the imagination <b><i>(a mental satanic "movie" performance)</i></b>,<br>
 but this fact in no way discredits the idea of the actual visible<br>
 appearance of Satan also. This second temptation in Luke is the<br>
 third in Matthew's order. Luke's order is geographical<br>
 <b><i>(wilderness, mountain, Jerusalem)</i></b>. Matthew's is climacteric<br>
 <b><i>(hunger, nervous dread, ambition)</i></b>. There is a climax in Luke's<br>
 order also <b><i>(sense, man, God)</i></b>. There is no way to tell the actual<br>
 order.<br>
 <br>
 4:6 <B>{All this authority}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n exousian taut&#275;n hapasan\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 4:9 has "all these things." Luke's report is more specific. <B>{And<br>
 the glory of them}</B> <b><i>(\kai t&#275;n doxan aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 4:8 has this in<br>
 the statement of what the devil did, not what he said. <B>{For it<br>
 hath been delivered unto me}</B> <b><i>(\hoti emoi paradedotai\)</i></b>. Perfect<br>
 passive indicative. Satan here claims possession of world power<br>
 and Jesus does not deny it. It may be due to man's sin and by<br>
 God's permission. Jesus calls Satan the ruler of this world <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 12:31; 14:30; 16:11)</i></b>. <B>{To whomsoever I will}</B> <b><i>(\hoi an thel&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present subjunctive with \an\ in an indefinite relative sentence.<br>
 This audacious claim, if allowed, makes one wonder whether some<br>
 of the world rulers are not, consciously or unconsciously, agents<br>
 of the devil. In several American cities there has been proven a<br>
 definite compact between the police and the underworld of crime.<br>
 But the tone of Satan here is one of superiority to Jesus in<br>
 world power. He offers him a share in it on one condition.<br>
 <br>
 4:7 <B>{Wilt worship before me}</B> <b><i>(\proskun&#275;s&#275;is en&#333;pion emou\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 4:9 has it more bluntly "worship me." That is what it really<br>
 comes to, though in Luke the matter is more delicately put. It is<br>
 a condition of the third class <b><i>(\ean\ and the subjunctive)</i></b>. Luke<br>
 has it "thou therefore if" <b><i>(\su oun ean\)</i></b>, in a very emphatic and<br>
 subtle way. It is the ingressive aorist <b><i>(\proskun&#275;s&#275;is\)</i></b>, just<br>
 bow the knee once up here in my presence. The temptation was for<br>
 Jesus to admit Satan's authority by this act of prostration <b><i>(fall<br>
 down and worship)</i></b>, a recognition of authority rather than of<br>
 personal merit. <B>{It shall all be thine}</B> <b><i>(\estai sou p&#257;sa\)</i></b>. Satan<br>
 offers to turn over all the keys of world power to Jesus. It was<br>
 a tremendous grand-stand play, but Jesus saw at once that in that<br>
 case he would be the agent of Satan in the rule of the world by<br>
 bargain and graft instead of the Son of God by nature and world<br>
 ruler by conquest over Satan. The heart of Satan's program is<br>
 here laid bare. Jesus here rejected the Jewish idea of the<br>
 Messiah as an earthly ruler merely. "He rejects Satan as an ally,<br>
 and thereby has him as an implacable enemy" <b><i>(Plummer.)</i></b><br>
 <br>
 4:8 <B>{Thou shalt worship}</B> <b><i>(\proskun&#275;seis\)</i></b>. Satan used this verb<br>
 to Jesus who turns it against him by the quotation from <!-#-->De<br>
 6:13. Jesus clearly perceived that one could not worship both<br>
 Satan and God. He had to choose whom he would serve. Luke does<br>
 not give the words, "Get thee hence, Satan" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 4:10)</i></b>, for he<br>
 has another temptation to narrate.<br>
 <br>
 4:9 <B>{Led him}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;gagen\)</i></b>. Aorist active indicative of \ag&#333;\. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 4:5 has \paralambanei\ <b><i>(dramatic present)</i></b>. <B>{The wing of the<br>
 temple}</B> <b><i>(\to pterugion tou hierou\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 4:5. It is not<br>
 easy to determine precisely what it was. <B>{From hence}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\enteuthen\)</i></b>. This Luke adds to the words in Matthew, which see.<br>
 <B>{To guard thee}</B> <b><i>(\tou diaphulaxai se\)</i></b>. Not in <!-#-->Mt 4:6 quoted by<br>
 Satan from <!-#-->Ps 91:11,12. Satan does not misquote this Psalm, but<br>
 he misapplies it and makes it mean presumptuous reliance on God.<br>
 This compound verb is very old, but occurs here alone in the N.T.<br>
 and that from the LXX. Luke repeats \hoti\ <b><i>(recitative \hoti\<br>
 after \gegraptai\, is written)</i></b> after this part of the quotation.<br>
 <br>
 4:12 <B>{It is said}</B> <b><i>(\eir&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative, stands<br>
 said, a favourite way of quoting Scripture in the N.T. In <!-#-->Mt<br>
 4:7 we have the usual "it is written" <b><i>(\gegraptai\)</i></b>. Here Jesus<br>
 quotes <!-#-->De 6:16. Each time he uses Deuteronomy against the<br>
 devil. The LXX is quoted. It is the volitive future indicative<br>
 with \ouk\, a common prohibition. Jesus points out to the devil<br>
 that testing God is not trusting God <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:13 <B>{Every temptation}</B> <b><i>(\panta peirasmon\)</i></b>. These three kinds<br>
 exhaust the avenues of approach <b><i>(the appetites, the nerves, the<br>
 ambitions)</i></b>. Satan tried them all. They formed a cycle <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>.<br>
 Hence "he was in all points tempted like as we are" <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 4:15)</i></b>.<br>
 "The enemy tried all his weapons, and was at all points defeated"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. Probably all during the forty days the devil tempted<br>
 him, but three are representatives of all. <B>{For a season}</B> <b><i>(\achri<br>
 kairou\)</i></b>. Until a good opportunity should return, the language<br>
 means. We are thus to infer that the devil returned to his attack<br>
 from time to time. In the Garden of Gethsemane he tempted Jesus<br>
 more severely than here. He was here trying to thwart the purpose<br>
 of Jesus to go on with his Messianic plans, to trip him at the<br>
 start. In Gethsemane the devil tried to make Jesus draw back from<br>
 the culmination of the Cross with all its agony and horror. The<br>
 devil attacked Jesus by the aid of Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 8:33)</i></b>, through the<br>
 Pharisees <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 8:40ff.)</i></b>, besides Gethsemane <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:42,53)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:14 <B>{Returned}</B> <b><i>(\hupestrepsen\)</i></b>. Luke does not fill in the gap<br>
 between the temptations in the wilderness of Judea and the<br>
 Galilean Ministry. He follows the outline of Mark. It is John's<br>
 Gospel alone that tells of the year of obscurity <b><i>(Stalker)</i></b> in<br>
 various parts of the Holy Land. <B>{In the power of the Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 t&#275;i dunamei tou pneumatos\)</i></b>. Luke in these two verses <b><i>(<!-#-->14,15)</i></b><br>
 gives a description of the Galilean Ministry with three marked<br>
 characteristics <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>: the power of the spirit, rapid spread<br>
 of Christ's fame, use of the Jewish synagogues. Luke often notes<br>
 the power of the Holy Spirit in the work of Christ. Our word<br>
 dynamite is this same word \dunamis\ <b><i>(power)</i></b>. <B>{A fame}</B> <b><i>(\ph&#275;m&#275;\)</i></b>.<br>
 An old Greek word found in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mt 9:26. It<br>
 is from \ph&#275;mi\, to say. Talk ran rapidly in every direction. It<br>
 assumes the previous ministry as told by John.<br>
 <br>
 4:15 <B>{And he taught}</B> <b><i>(\kai autos edidasken\)</i></b>. Luke is fond of<br>
 this mode of transition so that it is not certain that he means<br>
 to emphasize "he himself" as distinct from the rumour about him.<br>
 It is the imperfect tense, descriptive of the habit of Jesus. The<br>
 synagogues were an open door to Jesus before the hostility of the<br>
 Pharisees was aroused. <B>{Being glorified}</B> <b><i>(\doxazomenos\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 passive participle, durative action like the imperfect<br>
 \edidasken\. General admiration of Jesus everywhere. He was the<br>
 wonder teacher of his time. Even the rabbis had not yet learned<br>
 how to ridicule and oppose Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 4:16 <B>{Where he had been brought up}</B> <b><i>(\hou &#275;n tethrammenos\)</i></b>. Past<br>
 perfect passive periphrastic indicative, a state of completion in<br>
 past time, from \treph&#333;\, a common Greek verb. This visit is<br>
 before that recorded in <!-#-->Mr 6:1-6; Mt 13:54-58 which was just<br>
 before the third tour of Galilee. Here Jesus comes back after a<br>
 year of public ministry elsewhere and with a wide reputation <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 4:15)</i></b>. Luke may have in mind <!-#-->2:51, but for some time now<br>
 Nazareth had not been his home and that fact may be implied by<br>
 the past perfect tense. <B>{As his custom was}</B> <b><i>(\kata to ei&#333;thos<br>
 aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Second perfect active neuter singular participle of an<br>
 old \eth&#333;\ <b><i>(Homer)</i></b>, to be accustomed. Literally according to what<br>
 was customary to him <b><i>(\aut&#333;i\, dative case)</i></b>. This is one of the<br>
 flashlights on the early life of Jesus. He had the habit of going<br>
 to public worship in the synagogue as a boy, a habit that he kept<br>
 up when a grown man. If the child does not form the habit of<br>
 going to church, the man is almost certain not to have it. We<br>
 have already had in Matthew and Mark frequent instances of the<br>
 word synagogue which played such a large part in Jewish life<br>
 after the restoration from Babylon. <B>{Stood up}</B> <b><i>(\anest&#275;\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active indicative and intransitive. Very common verb. It<br>
 was the custom for the reader to stand except when the Book of<br>
 Esther was read at the feast of Purim when he might sit. It is<br>
 not here stated that Jesus had been in the habit of standing up<br>
 to read here or elsewhere. It was his habit to go to the<br>
 synagogue for worship. Since he entered upon his Messianic work<br>
 his habit was to teach in the synagogues <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 4:15)</i></b>. This was<br>
 apparently the first time that he had done so in Nazareth. He may<br>
 have been asked to read as Paul was in Antioch in Pisidia <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 13:15)</i></b>. The ruler of the synagogue for that day may have invited<br>
 Jesus to read and speak because of his now great reputation as a<br>
 teacher. Jesus could have stood up voluntarily and appropriately<br>
 because of his interest in his home town. <B>{To read}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anagn&#333;nai\)</i></b>. Second aorist active infinitive of \anagin&#333;sk&#333;\,<br>
 to recognize again the written characters and so to read and then<br>
 to read aloud. It appears first in Pindar in the sense of read<br>
 and always so in the N.T. This public reading aloud with<br>
 occasional comments may explain the parenthesis in <!-#-->Mt 24:15<br>
 <b><i>(Let him that readeth understand)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:17 <B>{Was delivered}</B> <b><i>(\epedoth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative of \epidid&#333;mi\, to give over to, a common verb. At the<br>
 proper stage of the service "the attendant" or "minister"<br>
 <b><i>(\hup&#275;ret&#275;s\, under rower)</i></b> or "beadle" took out a roll of the law<br>
 from the ark, unwrapped it, and gave it to some one to read. On<br>
 sabbath days some seven persons were asked to read small portions<br>
 of the law. This was the first lesson or _Parashah_. This was<br>
 followed by a reading from the prophets and a discourse, the<br>
 second lesson or _Haphtarah_. This last is what Jesus did. <B>{The<br>
 book of the prophet Isaiah}</B> <b><i>(\biblion tou proph&#275;tou Esaiou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "a roll of the prophet Isaiah." Apparently Isaiah was<br>
 handed to Jesus without his asking for it. But certainly Jesus<br>
 cared more for the prophets than for the ceremonial law. It was a<br>
 congenial service that he was asked to perform. Jesus used<br>
 Deuteronomy in his temptations and now Isaiah for this sermon.<br>
 The Syriac Sinaitic manuscript has it that Jesus stood up after<br>
 the attendant handed him the roll. <B>{Opened}</B> <b><i>(\anoixas\)</i></b>. Really<br>
 it was <B>{unrolled}</B> <b><i>(\anaptuxas\)</i></b> as Aleph D have it. But the more<br>
 general term \anoixas\ <b><i>(from \anoig&#333;\, common verb)</i></b> is probably<br>
 genuine. \Anaptuss&#333;\ does not occur in the N.T. outside of this<br>
 passage if genuine. <B>{Found the place}</B> <b><i>(\heuren ton topon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist active indicative. He continued to unroll <b><i>(rolling<br>
 up the other side)</i></b> till he found the passage desired. It may have<br>
 been a fixed lesson for the day or it may have been his own<br>
 choosing. At any rate it was a marvellously appropriate passage<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 61:1,2 with one clause omitted and some words from <!-#-->Isa<br>
 58:6)</i></b>. It is a free quotation from the Septuagint. <B>{Where it was<br>
 written}</B> <b><i>(\hou &#275;n gegrammenon\)</i></b>. Periphrastic pluperfect passive<br>
 again as in <!-#-->4:16.<br>
 <br>
 4:18 <B>{Anointed me}</B> <b><i>(\echrisen me\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of the verb \chri&#333;\ from which <B>{Christ}</B> <b><i>(\Christos\)</i></b><br>
 is derived, the Anointed One. Isaiah is picturing the Jubilee<br>
 year and the release of captives and the return from the<br>
 Babylonian exile with the hope of the Messiah through it all.<br>
 Jesus here applies this Messianic language to himself. "The<br>
 Spirit of the Lord is upon me" as was shown at the baptism <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 3:21)</i></b> where he was also "anointed" for his mission by the<br>
 Father's voice <b><i>(<!-#-->3:22)</i></b>. <B>{To the poor}</B> <b><i>(\pt&#333;chois\)</i></b>. Jesus<br>
 singles this out also as one of the items to tell John the<br>
 Baptist in prison <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 7:22)</i></b>. Our word _Gospel_ is a translation<br>
 of the Greek \Euaggelion\, and it is for the poor. <B>{He hath sent<br>
 me}</B> <b><i>(\apestalken me\)</i></b>. Change of tense to perfect active<br>
 indicative. He is now on that mission here. Jesus is God's<br>
 _Apostle_ to men <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 17:3, Whom thou didst send)</i></b>. <B>{Proclaim}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\k&#275;ruxai\)</i></b>. As a herald like Noah <b><i>(<!-#-->2Pe 2:5)</i></b>. <B>{To the captives}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aichmal&#333;tois\)</i></b>. Prisoners of war will be released <b><i>(\aichm&#275;\, a<br>
 spear point, and \hal&#333;tos\, from \haliskomai\, to be captured)</i></b>.<br>
 Captured by the spear point. Common word, but here only in the<br>
 N.T. <B>{Set at liberty}</B> <b><i>(\aposteilai\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 infinitive of \apostell&#333;\. Same verb as \apestalken\, above.<br>
 Brought in here from <!-#-->Isa 58:6. Plummer suggests that Luke<br>
 inserts it here from memory. But Jesus could easily have turned<br>
 back the roll and read it so. <B>{Them that are bruised}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\tethrausmenous\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of \thrau&#333;\, an<br>
 old verb, but here only in the N.T. It means to break in pieces<br>
 broken in heart and often in body as well. One loves to think<br>
 that Jesus felt it to be his mission to mend broken hearts like<br>
 pieces of broken earthenware, real rescue-mission work. Jesus<br>
 mends them and sets them free from their limitations.<br>
 <br>
 4:19 <B>{The acceptable year of the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\eniauton Kuriou<br>
 dekton\)</i></b>. He does not mean that his ministry is to be only one<br>
 year in length as Clement of Alexandria and Origen argued. That<br>
 is to turn figures into fact. The Messianic age has come, Jesus<br>
 means to say. On the first day of the year of Jubilee the priests<br>
 with sound of trumpet proclaimed the blessings of that year <b><i>(<!-#-->Le<br>
 25:8-17)</i></b>. This great passage justly pictures Christ's conception<br>
 of his mission and message.<br>
 <br>
 4:20 <B>{He closed the book}</B> <b><i>(\ptuxas to biblion\)</i></b>. Aorist active<br>
 participle of \ptuss&#333;\. Rolled up the roll and gave it back to<br>
 the attendant who had given it to him and who put it away again<br>
 in its case. <B>{Sat down}</B> <b><i>(\ekathisen\)</i></b>. Took his seat there as a<br>
 sign that he was going to speak instead of going back to his<br>
 former seat. This was the usual Jewish attitude for public<br>
 speaking and teaching <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 5:3; Mt 5:1; Mr 4:1; Ac 16:13)</i></b>. <B>{Were<br>
 fastened on him}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san atenizontes aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Periphrastic<br>
 imperfect active and so a vivid description. Literally, the eyes<br>
 of all in the synagogue were gazing fixedly upon him. The verb<br>
 \ateniz&#333;\ occurs in Aristotle and the Septuagint. It is from the<br>
 adjective \aten&#275;s\ and that from \tein&#333;\, to stretch, and<br>
 copulative or intensive \a\, not \a\ privative. The word occurs<br>
 in the N.T. here and in <!-#-->22:56, ten times in Acts, and in <!-#-->2Co<br>
 3:7,13. Paul uses it of the steady eager gaze of the people at<br>
 Moses when he came down from the mountain when he had been<br>
 communing with God. There was something in the look of Jesus here<br>
 that held the people spellbound for the moment, apart from the<br>
 great reputation with which he came to them. In small measure<br>
 every effective speaker knows what it is to meet the eager<br>
 expectations of an audience.<br>
 <br>
 4:21 <B>{And he began to say}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rxato de legein\)</i></b>. Aorist<br>
 ingressive active indicative and present infinitive. He began<br>
 speaking. The moment of hushed expectancy was passed. These may<br>
 or may not be the first words uttered here by Jesus. Often the<br>
 first sentence is the crucial one in winning an audience.<br>
 Certainly this is an arresting opening sentence. <B>{Hath been<br>
 fulfilled}</B> <b><i>(\pepl&#275;r&#333;tai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative, <B>{stands<br>
 fulfilled}</B>. "Today this scripture <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 61:1,2, just read)</i></b><br>
 stands fulfilled in your ears." It was a most amazing statement<br>
 and the people of Nazareth were quick to see the Messianic claim<br>
 involved. Jesus could only mean that the real year of Jubilee had<br>
 come, that the Messianic prophecy of Isaiah had come true today,<br>
 and that in him they saw the Messiah of prophecy. There are<br>
 critics today who deny that Jesus claimed to be the Messiah. To<br>
 be able to do that, they must reject the Gospel of John and all<br>
 such passages as this one. And it is no apocalyptic<br>
 eschatological Messiah whom Jesus here sets forth, but the one<br>
 who forgives sin and binds up the broken-hearted. The words were<br>
 too good to be true and to be spoken here at Nazareth by one of<br>
 their own townsmen!<br>
 <br>
 4:22 <B>{Bare him witness}</B> <b><i>(\emarturoun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, perhaps<br>
 inchoative. They all began to bear witness that the rumours were<br>
 not exaggerations <b><i>(<!-#-->4:14)</i></b> as they had supposed, but had<br>
 foundation in fact if this discourse or its start was a fair<br>
 sample of his teaching. The verb \marture&#333;\ is a very old and<br>
 common one. It is frequent in Acts, Paul's Epistles, and the<br>
 Johannine books. The substantive \martur\ is seen in our English<br>
 \martyr\, one who witnesses even by his death to his faith in<br>
 Christ. <B>{And wondered}</B> <b><i>(\kai ethaumazon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active also,<br>
 perhaps inchoative also. They began to marvel as he proceeded<br>
 with his address. This verb is an old one and common in the<br>
 Gospels for the attitude of the people towards Jesus. <B>{At the<br>
 words of grace}</B> <b><i>(\epi tois logois t&#275;s charitos\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Lu<br>
 1:30; 2:52 for this wonderful word \charis\ so full of meaning<br>
 and so often in the N.T. The genitive case <b><i>(case of genus or<br>
 kind)</i></b> here means that the words that came out of the mouth of<br>
 Jesus in a steady stream <b><i>(present tense, \ekporeuomenois\)</i></b> were<br>
 marked by fascination and charm. They were "winning words" as the<br>
 context makes plain, though they were also "gracious" in the<br>
 Pauline sense of "grace." There is no necessary antithesis in the<br>
 ideas of graceful and gracious in these words of Jesus. <B>{Is not<br>
 this Joseph's son?}</B> <b><i>(\Ouchi huios estin I&#333;s&#275;ph houtos;\)</i></b>. Witness<br>
 and wonder gave way to bewilderment as they began to explain to<br>
 themselves the situation. The use of \ouchi\ intensive form of<br>
 \ouk\ in a question expects the answer "yes." Jesus passed in<br>
 Nazareth as the son of Joseph as Luke presents him in <!-#-->3:23. He<br>
 does not stop here to correct this misconception because the<br>
 truth has been already amply presented in <!-#-->1:28-38; 2:49. This<br>
 popular conception of Jesus as the son of Joseph appears also in<br>
 <!-#-->Joh 1:45. The puzzle of the people was due to their previous<br>
 knowledge of Jesus as the carpenter <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 6:3; the carpenter's<br>
 son, <!-#-->Mt 13:55)</i></b>. For him now to appear as the Messiah in<br>
 Nazareth where he had lived and laboured as the carpenter was a<br>
 phenomenon impossible to credit on sober reflection. So the mood<br>
 of wonder and praise quickly turned with whispers and nods and<br>
 even scowls to doubt and hostility, a rapid and radical<br>
 transformation of emotion in the audience.<br>
 <br>
 4:23 <B>{Doubtless}</B> <b><i>(\pant&#333;s\)</i></b>. Adverb. Literally, at any rate,<br>
 certainly, assuredly. Cf. <!-#-->Ac 21:22; 28:4. <B>{This parable}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n<br>
 parabol&#275;n taut&#275;n\)</i></b>. See discussion on &#175;Mt 13. Here the word has<br>
 a special application to a crisp proverb which involves a<br>
 comparison. The word physician is the point of comparison. Luke<br>
 the physician alone gives this saying of Jesus. The proverb means<br>
 that the physician was expected to take his own medicine and to<br>
 heal himself. The word \parabol&#275;\ in the N.T. is confined to the<br>
 Synoptic Gospels except <!-#-->Heb 9:9; 11:19. This use for a proverb<br>
 occurs also in <!-#-->Lu 5:36; 6:39. This proverb in various forms<br>
 appears not only among the Jews, but in Euripides and Aeschylus<br>
 among the Greeks, and in Cicero's _Letters_. Hobart quotes the<br>
 same idea from Galen, and the Chinese used to demand it of their<br>
 physicians. The point of the parable seems to be that the people<br>
 were expecting him to make good his claim to the Messiahship by<br>
 doing here in Nazareth what they had heard of his doing in<br>
 Capernaum and elsewhere. "Establish your claims by direct<br>
 evidence" <b><i>(Easton)</i></b>. This same appeal <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b> was addressed to<br>
 Christ on the Cross <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:40,42)</i></b>. There is a tone of sarcasm<br>
 towards Jesus in both cases. <B>{Heard done}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kousamen genomena\)</i></b>.<br>
 The use of this second aorist middle participle \genomena\ after<br>
 \&#275;kousamen\ is a neat Greek idiom. It is punctiliar action in<br>
 indirect discourse after this verb of sensation or emotion<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 1040-42, 1122-24)</i></b>. <B>{Do also here}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\poi&#275;son kai h&#333;de\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist active imperative. Do it<br>
 here in thy own country and town and do it now. Jesus applies the<br>
 proverb to himself as an interpretation of their real attitude<br>
 towards himself.<br>
 <br>
 4:24 <B>{And he said}</B> <b><i>(\eipen de\)</i></b>. Also in <!-#-->1:13. The interjection<br>
 of these words here by Luke may indicate a break in his address,<br>
 though there is no other indication of an interval here. Perhaps<br>
 they only serve to introduce solemnly the new proverb like the<br>
 words <B>{Verily I say unto you}</B> <b><i>(\am&#275;n leg&#333; humin\)</i></b>. This proverb<br>
 about the prophet having no honour in his own country Jesus had<br>
 already applied to himself according to <!-#-->Joh 4:44. Both <!-#-->Mr 6:4<br>
 and <!-#-->Mt 13:57 give it in a slightly altered form on the last<br>
 visit of Jesus to Nazareth. The devil had tempted Jesus to make a<br>
 display of his power to the people by letting them see him<br>
 floating down from the pinnacle of the temple <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 4:9-11)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:25 <B>{Three years and six months}</B> <b><i>(\et&#275; tria kai m&#275;nas hex\)</i></b>.<br>
 Accusative of duration of time without \epi\ <b><i>(doubtful)</i></b>. The same<br>
 period is given in <!-#-->Jas 5:17, the popular Jewish way of<br>
 speaking. In <!-#-->1Ki 18:1 the rain is said to have come in the<br>
 third year. But the famine probably lasted still longer.<br>
 <br>
 4:26 <B>{Unto Zarephath}</B> <b><i>(\eis Sarepta\)</i></b>. The modern village<br>
 Surafend on the coast road between Tyre and Sidon. <B>{Unto a woman<br>
 that was a widow}</B> <b><i>(\pros gunaika ch&#275;ran\)</i></b>. Literally, unto a<br>
 woman a widow <b><i>(like our vernacular widow woman)</i></b>. This is an<br>
 illustration of the proverb from the life of Elijah <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ki<br>
 17:8,9)</i></b>. This woman was in the land of Sidon or Phoenicia, a<br>
 heathen, where Jesus himself will go later.<br>
 <br>
 4:27 <B>{In the time of Elisha the prophet}</B> <b><i>(\epi Elisaiou tou<br>
 proph&#275;tou\)</i></b>. This use of \epi\ with the genitive for "in the time<br>
 of" is a good Greek idiom. The second illustration of the proverb<br>
 is from the time of Elisha and is another heathen, <B>{Naaman the<br>
 Syrian}</B> <b><i>(\Naiman ho Syros\)</i></b>. He was the lone leper that was<br>
 cleansed by Elisha <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ki 5:1,14)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:28 <B>{They were all filled with wrath}</B> <b><i>(\epl&#275;sth&#275;san pantes<br>
 thumou\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of the common verb<br>
 \pimpl&#275;mi\ followed by the genitive case. The people of Nazareth<br>
 at once caught on and saw the point of these two Old Testament<br>
 illustrations of how God in two cases blessed the heathen instead<br>
 of the Jewish people. The implication was evident. Nazareth was<br>
 no better than Capernaum if as good. He was under no special<br>
 obligation to do unusual things in Nazareth because he had been<br>
 reared there. Town pride was insulted and it at once exploded in<br>
 a burst of rage.<br>
 <br>
 4:29 <B>{They rose up and cast him forth}</B> <b><i>(\anastantes exebalon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist ingressive active participle and second aorist<br>
 effective active indicative. A movement towards lynching Jesus.<br>
 <B>{Unto the brow of the hill}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;os ophruos tou orous\)</i></b>. Eyebrow<br>
 <b><i>(\ophrus\)</i></b>, in Homer, then any jutting prominence. Only here in<br>
 the N.T. Hippocrates speaks of the eyebrow hanging over. <B>{Was<br>
 built}</B> <b><i>(\&#333;ikodom&#275;to\)</i></b>. Past perfect indicative, stood built.<br>
 <B>{That they might throw him down headlong}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste katakr&#275;mnisai<br>
 auton\)</i></b>. Neat Greek idiom with \h&#333;ste\ for intended result, "so<br>
 as to cast him down the precipice." The infinitive alone can<br>
 convey the same meaning <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 2:2; 20:28; Lu 2:23)</i></b>. \Kr&#275;mnos\ is<br>
 an overhanging bank or precipice from \kremannumi\, to hang.<br>
 \Kata\ is down. The verb occurs in Xenophon, Demosthenes, LXX,<br>
 Josephus. Here only in the N.T. At the southwest corner of the<br>
 town of Nazareth such a cliff today exists overhanging the<br>
 Maronite convent. Murder was in the hearts of the people. By<br>
 pushing him over they hoped to escape technical guilt.<br>
 <br>
 4:30 <B>{He went his way}</B> <b><i>(\eporeueto\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense, he was<br>
 going on his way.<br>
 <br>
 4:31 <B>{Came down}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;lthen\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr 1:21 has the historical<br>
 present, <B>{they go into}</B> <b><i>(\eisporeuontai\)</i></b>. Capernaum <b><i>(Tell Hum)</i></b><br>
 is now the headquarters of the Galilean ministry, since Nazareth<br>
 has rejected Jesus. <!-#-->Lu 4:31-37 is parallel with <!-#-->Mr 1:21-28<br>
 which he manifestly uses. It is the first of Christ's miracles<br>
 which they give. <B>{Was teaching them}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n didask&#333;n autous\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic imperfect. Mark has \edidasken\ first and then \en<br>
 didask&#333;n\. "Them" here means the people present in the synagogue<br>
 on the sabbath, construction according to sense as in <!-#-->Mr 1:22.<br>
 <br>
 4:32 Rest of the sentence as in Mark, which see, except that Luke<br>
 omits "and not as their scribes" and uses \hoti &#275;n\ instead of<br>
 \h&#333;s ech&#333;n\.<br>
 <br>
 4:33 <B>{Which had}</B> <b><i>(\ech&#333;n\)</i></b>. Mark has \en\. <B>{A spirit of an<br>
 unclean demon}</B> <b><i>(\pneuma daimoniou akathartou\)</i></b>. Mark has "unclean<br>
 spirit." Luke's phrase here is unique in this combination.<br>
 Plummer notes that Matthew has \daimonion\ ten times and<br>
 \akatharton\ twice as an epithet of \pneuma\; Mark has<br>
 \daimonion\ thirteen times and \akatharton\ eleven times as an<br>
 epithet of \pneuma\. Luke's Gospel uses \daimonion\ twenty-two<br>
 times and \akatharton\ as an epithet, once of \daimonion\ as here<br>
 and once of \pneuma\. In Mark the man is in <b><i>(\en\)</i></b> the power of<br>
 the unclean spirit, while here the man "has" a spirit of an<br>
 unclean demon. <B>{With a loud voice}</B> <b><i>(\ph&#333;n&#275;i megal&#275;i\)</i></b>. Not in<br>
 Mark. Really a scream caused by the sudden contact of the demon<br>
 with Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 4:34 <B>{Ah!}</B> <b><i>(\Ea\)</i></b>. An interjection frequent in the Attic poets,<br>
 but rare in prose. Apparently second person singular imperative<br>
 of \ea&#333;\, to permit. It is expressive of wonder, fear,<br>
 indignation. Here it amounts to a diabolical screech. For the<br>
 rest of the verse see discussion on &#175;Mr 1:24 and &#175;Mt 8:29. The<br>
 muzzle <b><i>(\phimos\)</i></b> occurs literally in <!-#-->1Co 9:9, 1Ti 5:18, and<br>
 metaphorically here and <!-#-->Mr 1:25; 4:39; Mt 22:12.<br>
 <br>
 4:35 <B>{Had thrown him down in the midst}</B> <b><i>(\rhipsan auton eis to<br>
 meson\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b> participle of \rhipt&#333;\, an old<br>
 verb with violent meaning, to fling, throw, hurl off or down.<br>
 <B>{Having done him no hurt}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;den blapsan auton\)</i></b>. Luke as a<br>
 physician carefully notes this important detail not in Mark.<br>
 \Blapt&#333;\, to injure, or hurt, occurs in the N.T. only here and in<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 16:18, though a very common verb in the old Greek.<br>
 <br>
 4:36 <B>{Amazement came}</B> <b><i>(\egeneto thambos\)</i></b>. Mark has<br>
 \ethamb&#275;th&#275;san\. <B>{They spake together one with another}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sunelaloun pros all&#275;lous\)</i></b>. Imperfect indicative active and the<br>
 reciprocal pronoun. Mark has simply the infinitive \sunz&#275;tein\<br>
 <b><i>(question)</i></b>. <B>{For}</B> <b><i>(\hoti\)</i></b>. We have here an ambiguous \hoti\ as<br>
 in <!-#-->1:45, which can be either the relative "that" or the casual<br>
 \hoti\ "because" or "for," as the Revised Version has it. Either<br>
 makes good sense. Luke adds here \dunamei\ <b><i>(with power)</i></b> to Mark's<br>
 "authority" <b><i>(\exousian\)</i></b>. <B>{And they come out}</B> <b><i>(\exerchontai\)</i></b>. So<br>
 Luke where Mark has "and they obey him" <b><i>(\kai upakouousin<br>
 aut&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:37 <B>{Went forth a rumour}</B> <b><i>(\exeporeueto &#275;chos\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 middle, kept on going forth. Our very word \echo\ in this word.<br>
 Late Greek form for \&#275;ch&#333;\ in the old Greek. Used for the roar of<br>
 the waves on the shore. So in <!-#-->Lu 21:25. Vivid picture of the<br>
 resounding influence of this day's work in the synagogue, in<br>
 Capernaum.<br>
 <br>
 4:38 <B>{He rose up}</B> <b><i>(\anastas\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of<br>
 \anist&#275;mi\, a common verb. B. Weiss adds here "from the teacher's<br>
 seat." Either from his seat or merely leaving the synagogue. This<br>
 incident of the healing of Peter's mother-in-law is given in <!-#-->Mr<br>
 1:29-34 and <!-#-->Mt 8:14-17, which see for details. <B>{Into the house<br>
 of Simon}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n oikian Sim&#333;nos\)</i></b>. "Peter's house" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 8:14)</i></b>. "The house of Simon and Andrew" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:29)</i></b>. Paul's<br>
 reference to Peter's wife <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 9:5)</i></b> is pertinent. They lived<br>
 together in Capernaum. This house came also to be the Capernaum<br>
 home of Jesus. <B>{Simon's wife's mother}</B> <b><i>(\penthera tou Sim&#333;nos\)</i></b>.<br>
 The word \penthera\ for mother-in-law is old and well established<br>
 in usage. Besides the parallel passages <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:30; Mt 8:14; Lu<br>
 4:38)</i></b> it occurs in the N.T. only in <!-#-->Lu 12:53. The<br>
 corresponding word \pentheros\, father-in-law, occurs in <!-#-->Joh<br>
 18:13 alone in the N.T. <B>{Was holden with a great fever}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n<br>
 sunechomen&#275; puret&#333;i megal&#333;i\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect passive,<br>
 the analytical tense accenting the continuous fever, perhaps<br>
 chronic and certainly severe. Luke employs this verb nine times<br>
 and only three others in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 4:24 passive with<br>
 diseases here; <!-#-->2Co 5:14 active; <!-#-->Php 1:23 passive)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Ac<br>
 28:8 the passive "with dysentery" is like the construction here<br>
 and is a common one in Greek medical writers as in Greek<br>
 literature generally. Luke uses the passive with "fear," <!-#-->Lu<br>
 8:37, the active for holding the hands over the ears <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 7:57)</i></b><br>
 and for pressing one or holding together <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:45; 19:43;<br>
 22:63)</i></b>, the direct middle for holding oneself to preaching <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 18:5)</i></b>. It is followed here by the instrumental case. Hobart<br>
 <b><i>(_Medical Language of Luke_, p. 3)</i></b> quotes Galen as dividing<br>
 fevers into "great" <b><i>(\megaloi\)</i></b> and "small" <b><i>(\smikroi\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:39 <B>{He stood over her}</B> <b><i>(\epistas epan&#333; aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active participle. Only in Luke. Surely we are not to take Luke<br>
 to mean that Jesus here took the exorcist's position and was<br>
 rebuking a malignant personality. The attitude of Jesus is<br>
 precisely that of any kindly sympathetic physician. <!-#-->Mr 1:31; Mt<br>
 8:15 mention the touch of her hand rather than the tender look<br>
 over her head. <B>{Rebuked}</B> <b><i>(\epetim&#275;sen\)</i></b>. Only in Luke. Jesus bade<br>
 the fever leave her as he spoke to the wind and the waves and<br>
 Luke uses this same verb <b><i>(<!-#-->8:24)</i></b>. <B>{Rose up and ministered}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anast&#257;sa di&#275;konei\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle as in<br>
 verse <!-#-->38, but inchoative imperfect tense \di&#275;konei\, from<br>
 \diakone&#333;\ <b><i>(note augment of compound verb)</i></b>. She rose up<br>
 immediately, though a long high fever usually leaves one very<br>
 weak. The cure was instantaneous and complete. She began to<br>
 minister at once and kept it up.<br>
 <br>
 4:40 <B>{When the sun was setting}</B> <b><i>(\dunontos tou h&#275;liou\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute and present participle <b><i>(\dun&#333;\, late form of \du&#333;\)</i></b><br>
 picturing the sunset scene. Even <!-#-->Mr 1:32 has here the aorist<br>
 indicative \edusen\ <b><i>(punctiliar active)</i></b>. It was not only cooler,<br>
 but it was the end of the sabbath when it was not regarded as<br>
 work <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b> to carry a sick person <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 5:10)</i></b>. And also by<br>
 now the news of the cure of the demoniac of Peter's mother-in-law<br>
 had spread all over the town. <B>{Had}</B> <b><i>(\eichon\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense<br>
 including all the chronic cases. <B>{With divers diseases}</B> <b><i>(\nosois<br>
 poikilais\)</i></b>. Instrumental case. For "divers" say "many coloured"<br>
 or "variegated." See on &#175;Mt 4:24; Mr 1:34. <B>{Brought}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;gagon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Constative summary second aorist active indicative like <!-#-->Mt<br>
 8:16, \prosenegkan\, where <!-#-->Mr 1:32 has the imperfect<br>
 \epheron\, brought one after another. <B>{He laid his hands on every<br>
 one of them and healed them}</B> <b><i>(\ho de heni hekast&#333;i aut&#333;n tas<br>
 cheiras epititheis etherapeuen autous\)</i></b>. Note the present active<br>
 participle \epititheis\ and the imperfect active \etherapeuen\,<br>
 picturing the healing one by one with the tender touch upon each<br>
 one. Luke alone gives this graphic detail which was more than a<br>
 mere ceremonial laying on of hands. Clearly the cures of Jesus<br>
 reached the physical, mental, and spiritual planes of human<br>
 nature. He is Lord of life and acted here as Master of each case<br>
 as it came.<br>
 <br>
 4:41 <B>{Came out}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#275;rcheto\, singular, or \ex&#275;rchonto\, plural)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect tense, repetition, from one after another. <B>{Thou art<br>
 the Son of God}</B> <b><i>(\Su ei ho huios tou theou\)</i></b>. More definite<br>
 statement of the deity of Jesus than the witness of the demoniac<br>
 in the synagogue <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 4:34; Mr 1:24)</i></b>, like the words of the<br>
 Father <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 3:22)</i></b> and more so than the condition of the devil<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 4:3,9)</i></b>. In the Canterbury Revision "devils" should always<br>
 be "demons" <b><i>(\daimonia\)</i></b> as here. <B>{Suffered them not to speak}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ouk eia auta lalein\)</i></b>. Imperfect third singular active of<br>
 \ea&#333;\, very old and common verb with syllabic augment \ei\. The<br>
 tense accents the continued refusal of Jesus to receive testimony<br>
 to his person and work from demons. Cf. <!-#-->Mt 8:4 to the lepers.<br>
 <B>{Because they knew}</B> <b><i>(\hoti &#275;ideisan\)</i></b>. Causal, not declarative,<br>
 \hoti\. Past perfect of the second perfect \oida\. <B>{That he was<br>
 the Christ}</B> <b><i>(\ton Christon auton einai\)</i></b>. Infinitive in indirect<br>
 assertion with the accusative of general reference. \Ton<br>
 Christon\ = <B>{the Anointed}</B>, the Messiah.<br>
 <br>
 4:42 <B>{When it was day}</B> <b><i>(\genomen&#275;s h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute<br>
 with aorist middle participle. <!-#-->Mr 1:35 notes it was "a great<br>
 while before day" <b><i>(which see for discussion)</i></b> when Jesus rose up<br>
 to go after a restless night. No doubt, because of the excitement<br>
 of the previous sabbath in Capernaum. He went out to pray <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 1:35)</i></b>. <B>{Sought after him}</B> <b><i>(\epez&#275;toun auton\)</i></b>. Imperfect active<br>
 indicative. The multitudes kept at it until "they came unto him"<br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;lthon he&#333;s autou\, aorist active indicative)</i></b>. They<br>
 accomplished their purpose, \he&#333;s autou\, right up to him. <B>{Would<br>
 have stayed him}</B> <b><i>(\kateichon auton\)</i></b>. Better, <B>{They tried to<br>
 hinder him}</B>. The conative imperfect active of \katech&#333;\, an old<br>
 and common verb. It means either to hold fast <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:15)</i></b>, to<br>
 take, get possession of <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 14:9)</i></b> or to hold back, to retain,<br>
 to restrain <b><i>(<!-#-->Phm 1:13; Ro 1:18; 7:6; 2Th 2:6; Lu 4:42)</i></b>. In this<br>
 passage it is followed by the ablative case. <B>{That he should not<br>
 go from them}</B> <b><i>(\tou m&#275; poreuesthai ap' aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Literally, "from<br>
 going away from them." The use of \m&#275;\ <b><i>(not)</i></b> after \kateichon\ is<br>
 the neat Greek idiom of the redundant negative after a verb of<br>
 hindering like the French _ne_ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1171)</i></b> .<br>
 <br>
 4:43 <B>{I must}</B> <b><i>(\me dei\)</i></b>. Jesus felt the urge to go with the work<br>
 of evangelism "to the other cities also," to all, not to a<br>
