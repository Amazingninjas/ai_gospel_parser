<p>3:1 <B>{But as unto carnal}</B> <b><i>(\all' h&#333;s sarkinois\)</i></b>. Latin _carneus_.<br>
 "As men o' flesh," Braid Scots; "as worldlings," Moffatt. This<br>
 form in \-inos\ like \lithinos\ in <!-#-->2Co 3:3 means the material<br>
 of flesh, "not on tablets of stone, but on fleshen tablets on<br>
 hearts." So in <!-#-->Heb 7:16. But in <!-#-->Ro 7:14 Paul says, "I am<br>
 fleshen <b><i>(\sarkinos\)</i></b> sold under sin," as if \sarkinos\<br>
 represented the extreme power of the \sarx\. Which does Paul mean<br>
 here? He wanted to speak the wisdom of God among the adults <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 2:6)</i></b>, the spiritual <b><i>(\hoi pneumatikoi\, <!-#-->2:15)</i></b>, but he was<br>
 unable to treat them as \pneumatikoi\ in reality because of their<br>
 seditions and immoralities. It is not wrong to be \sarkinos\, for<br>
 we all live in the flesh <b><i>(\en sarki\, <!-#-->Ga 2:20)</i></b>, but we are not<br>
 to live according to the flesh <b><i>(\kata sarka\, <!-#-->Ro 8:12)</i></b>. It is<br>
 not culpable to a babe in Christ <b><i>(\n&#275;pios\, <!-#-->1Co 13:11)</i></b>, unless<br>
 unduly prolonged <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 14:20; Heb 5:13f.)</i></b>. It is one of the<br>
 tragedies of the minister's life that he has to keep on speaking<br>
 to the church members "as unto babes in Christ" <b><i>(\h&#333;s n&#275;piois en<br>
 Christ&#333;i\)</i></b>, who actually glory in their long babyhood whereas<br>
 they ought to be teachers of the gospel instead of belonging to<br>
 the cradle roll. Paul's goal was for all the babes to become<br>
 adults <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 1:28)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:2 <B>{I fed you with milk, not with meat}</B> <b><i>(\gala humas epotisa, ou<br>
 br&#333;ma\)</i></b>. Note two accusatives with the verb, \epotisa\, first<br>
 aorist active indicative of \potiz&#333;\, as with other causative<br>
 verbs, that of the person and of the thing. In the LXX and the<br>
 papyri the verb often means to irrigate. \Br&#333;ma\ does not mean<br>
 meat <b><i>(flesh)</i></b> as opposed to bread, but all solid food as in "meats<br>
 and drinks" <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 9:7)</i></b>. It is a zeugma to use \epotisa\ with<br>
 \br&#333;ma\. Paul did not glory in making his sermons thin and<br>
 watery. Simplicity does not require lack of ideas or dulness. It<br>
 is pathetic to think how the preacher has to clip the wings of<br>
 thought and imagination because the hearers cannot go with him.<br>
 But nothing hinders great preaching like the dulness caused by<br>
 sin on the part of auditors who are impatient with the high<br>
 demands of the gospel.<br>
 <br>
 3:3 <B>{For ye are yet carnal}</B> <b><i>(\eti gar sarkikoi este\)</i></b>.<br>
 \Sarkikos\, unlike \sarkinos\, like \ikos\ formations, means<br>
 adapted to, fitted for the flesh <b><i>(\sarx\)</i></b>, one who lives<br>
 according to the flesh <b><i>(\kata sarka\)</i></b>. Paul by \psuchikos\<br>
 describes the unregenerate man, by \pneumatikos\ the regenerate<br>
 man. Both classes are \sarkinoi\ made in flesh, and both may be<br>
 \sarkikoi\ though the \pneumatikoi\ should not be. The<br>
 \pneumatikoi\ who continue to be \sarkinoi\ are still babes<br>
 <b><i>(\n&#275;pioi\)</i></b>, not adults <b><i>(\teleioi\)</i></b>, while those who are still<br>
 \sarkikoi\ <b><i>(carnal)</i></b> have given way to the flesh as if they were<br>
 still \psuchikoi\ <b><i>(unregenerate)</i></b>. It is a bold and cutting<br>
 figure, not without sarcasm, but necessary to reveal the<br>
 Corinthians to themselves. <B>{Jealousy and strife}</B> <b><i>(\z&#275;los kai<br>
 eris\)</i></b>. Zeal <b><i>(\z&#275;los\ from \ze&#333;\, to boil)</i></b> is not necessarily<br>
 evil, but good if under control. It may be not according to<br>
 knowledge <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 10:2)</i></b> and easily becomes jealousy <b><i>(same root<br>
 through the French _jaloux_)</i></b> as zeal. Ardour may be like the<br>
 jealousy of God <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:2)</i></b> or the envy of men <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 5:17)</i></b>.<br>
 \Eris\ is an old word, but used only by Paul in N.T. <b><i>(see on &#175;1Co<br>
 1:11)</i></b>. Wrangling follows jealousy. These two voices of the<br>
 spirit are to Paul proof that the Corinthians are still<br>
 \sarkikoi\ and walking according to men, not according to the<br>
 Spirit of Christ.<br>
 <br>
 3:4 <B>{For when one saith}</B> <b><i>(\hotan gar leg&#275;i tis\)</i></b>. Indefinite<br>
 temporal clause with the present subjunctive of repetition<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 972)</i></b>. Each instance is a case in point<br>
 and proof abundant of the strife. <B>{Of Paul}</B> <b><i>(\Paulou\)</i></b>. Predicate<br>
 genitive, belong to Paul, on Paul's side. <B>{Of Apollos}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Apoll&#333;\)</i></b>. Same genitive, but the form is the so-called Attic<br>
 second declension. See the nominative \Apoll&#333;s\ in verse <!-#-->5.<br>
 <B>{Men}</B> <b><i>(\anthr&#333;poi\)</i></b>. Just mere human creatures <b><i>(\anthr&#333;poi\,<br>
 generic term for mankind)</i></b>, in the flesh <b><i>(\sarkinoi\)</i></b>, acting like<br>
 the flesh <b><i>(\sarkikoi\)</i></b>, not \pneumatikoi\, as if still<br>
 \psuchikoi\. It was a home-thrust. Paul would not even defend his<br>
 own partisans.<br>
 <br>
 3:5 <B>{What then?}</B> <b><i>(\ti oun;\)</i></b>. He does not say \tis\ <b><i>(who)</i></b>, but<br>
 \ti\ <b><i>(what)</i></b>, neuter singular interrogative pronoun. <B>{Ministers}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\diakonoi\)</i></b>. Not leaders of parties or sects, but merely<br>
 servants through whom ye believed. The etymology of the word<br>
 Thayer gives as \dia\ and \konis\ "raising dust by hastening." In<br>
 the Gospels it is the servant <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 20:26)</i></b> or waiter <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 2:5)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul so describes himself as a minister <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 1:23,25)</i></b>. The<br>
 technical sense of deacon comes later <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 1:1; 1Ti 3:8,12)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{As the Lord gave to him}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s ho Kurios ed&#333;ken\)</i></b>. Hence no<br>
 minister of the Lord like Apollos and Paul has any basis for<br>
 pride or conceit nor should be made the occasion for faction and<br>
 strife. This idea Paul enlarges upon through chapters <!-#-->1Co 3; 4<br>
 and it is made plain in chapter <!-#-->1Co 12.<br>
 <br>
 3:6 <B>{I planted}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; ephuteusa\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative<br>
 of old verb \phuteu&#333;\. This Paul did as Luke tells us in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 18:1-18. <B>{Apollos watered}</B> <b><i>(\Apoll&#333;s epotisen\)</i></b>. Apollos<br>
 irrigated the church there as is seen in <!-#-->Ac 18:24-19:1. Another<br>
 aorist tense as in verse <!-#-->2. <B>{But God gave the increase}</B> <b><i>(\alla<br>
 ho theos &#275;uxanen\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense here <b><i>(active indicative)</i></b> for<br>
 the continuous blessing of God both on the work of Paul and<br>
 Apollos, co-labourers with God in God's field <b><i>(verse <!-#-->9)</i></b>.<br>
 Reports of revivals sometimes give the glory to the evangelist or<br>
 to both evangelist and pastor. Paul gives it all to God. He and<br>
 Apollos cooperated as successive pastors.<br>
 <br>
 3:7 <B>{So then neither--neither--but}</B> <b><i>(\H&#333;ste oute--oute--all'\)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul applies his logic relentlessly to the facts. He had asked<br>
 <B>{what}</B> <b><i>(\ti\)</i></b> is Apollos or Paul <b><i>(verse <!-#-->5)</i></b>. The answer is here.<br>
 <B>{Neither is anything}</B> <b><i>(\ti\)</i></b> <B>{the one who plants nor the one who<br>
 waters}</B>. God is the whole and we are not anything.<br>
 <br>
 3:8 <B>{Are one}</B> <b><i>(\hen eisin\)</i></b>. The neuter singular again <b><i>(\hen\,<br>
 not \heis\)</i></b> as with the interrogative \ti\ and the indefinite<br>
 \ti\. By this bold metaphor which Paul expands he shows how the<br>
 planter and the waterer work together. If no one planted, the<br>
 watering would be useless. If no one watered, the planting would<br>
 come to naught as the dreadful drouth of 1930 testifies while<br>
 these words are written. <B>{According to his own labour}</B> <b><i>(\kata ton<br>
 idion kopon\)</i></b>. God will bestow to each the reward that his labour<br>
 deserves. That is the pay that the preacher is sure to receive.<br>
 He may get too little or too much here from men. But the due<br>
 reward from God is certain and it will be adequate however<br>
 ungrateful men may be.<br>
 <br>
 3:9 <B>{God's fellow-workers}</B> <b><i>(\theou sunergoi\)</i></b>. This old word<br>
 <b><i>(co-workers of God)</i></b> has a new dignity here. God is the major<br>
 partner in the enterprise of each life, but he lets us work with<br>
 him. Witness the mother and God with the baby as the product.<br>
 <B>{God's husbandry}</B> <b><i>(\theou ge&#333;rgion\)</i></b>. God's tilled land <b><i>(\g&#275;,<br>
 ergon\)</i></b>. The farmer works with God in God's field. Without the<br>
 sun, the rains, the seasons the farmer is helpless. <B>{God's<br>
 building}</B> <b><i>(\theou oikodom&#275;\)</i></b>. God is the Great Architect. We work<br>
 under him and carry out the plans of the Architect. It is<br>
 building <b><i>(\oikos\, house, \dem&#333;\, to build)</i></b>. Let us never forget<br>
 that God sees and cares what we do in the part of the building<br>
 where we work for him.<br>
 <br>
 3:10 <B>{As a wise masterbuilder}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s sophos architekt&#333;n\)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 does not shirk his share in the work at Corinth with all the sad<br>
 outcome there. He absolves Apollos from responsibility for the<br>
 divisions. He denies that he himself is to blame. In doing so he<br>
 has to praise himself because the Judaizers who fomented the<br>
 trouble at Corinth had directly blamed Paul. It is not always<br>
 wise for a preacher to defend himself against attack, but it is<br>
 sometimes necessary. Factions in the church were now a fact and<br>
 Paul went to the bottom of the matter. God gave Paul the grace to<br>
 do what he did. This is the only New Testament example of the old<br>
 and common word \architekt&#333;n\, our architect. \Tekt&#333;n\ is from<br>
 \tikt&#333;\, to beget, and means a begetter, then a worker in wood or<br>
 stone, a carpenter or mason <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 13:55; Mr 6:3)</i></b>. \Archi-\ is an<br>
 old inseparable prefix like \archaggelos\ <b><i>(archangel)</i></b>,<br>
 \archepiscopos\ <b><i>(archbishop)</i></b>, \archiereus\ <b><i>(chiefpriest)</i></b>.<br>
 \Architekt&#333;n\ occurs in the papyri and inscriptions in an even<br>
 wider sense than our use of architect, sometimes of the chief<br>
 engineers. But Paul means to claim primacy as pastor of the<br>
 church in Corinth as is true of every pastor who is the architect<br>
 of the whole church life and work. All the workmen <b><i>(\tektones\,<br>
 carpenters)</i></b> work under the direction of the architect <b><i>(Plato,<br>
 _Statesman_, 259)</i></b>. "As a wise architect I laid a foundation"<br>
 <b><i>(\themelion eth&#275;ka\)</i></b>. Much depends on the wisdom of the architect<br>
 in laying the foundation. This is the technical phrase <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:48;<br>
 14:29)</i></b>, a cognate accusative for \themelion\. The substantive<br>
 \themelion\ is from the same root \the\ as \eth&#275;ka\ <b><i>(\ti-th&#275;mi\)</i></b>.<br>
 We cannot neatly reproduce the idiom in English. "I placed a<br>
 placing" does only moderately well. Paul refers directly to the<br>
 events described by Luke in <!-#-->Ac 18:1-18. The aorist \eth&#275;ka\ is<br>
 the correct text, not the perfect \tetheika\. <B>{Another buildeth<br>
 thereon}</B> <b><i>(\allos epoikodomei\)</i></b>. Note the preposition \epi\ with<br>
 the verb each time <b><i>(<!-#-->10,11,12,14)</i></b>. The successor to Paul did not<br>
 have to lay a new foundation, but only to go on building on that<br>
 already laid. It is a pity when the new pastor has to dig up the<br>
 foundation and start all over again as if an earthquake had come.<br>
 <B>{Take heed how he buildeth thereon}</B> <b><i>(\blepet&#333; p&#333;s epoikodomei\)</i></b>.<br>
 The carpenters have need of caution how they carry out the plans<br>
 of the original architect. Successive architects of great<br>
 cathedrals carry on through centuries the original design. The<br>
 result becomes the wonder of succeeding generations. There is no<br>
 room for individual caprice in the superstructure.<br>
 <br>
 3:11 <B>{Other foundation}</B> <b><i>(\themelion allon\)</i></b>. The gender of the<br>
 adjective is here masculine as is shown by \allon\. If neuter, it<br>
 would be \allo\. It is masculine because Paul has Christ in mind.<br>
 It is not here \heteron\ a different kind of gospel <b><i>(\heteron<br>
 euaggelion\, <!-#-->Ga 1:6; 2Co 11:4)</i></b> which is not another <b><i>(\allo\,<br>
 <!-#-->Ga 1:7)</i></b> in reality. But another Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:4, \allon<br>
 I&#275;soun\)</i></b> is a reflection on the one Lord Jesus. Hence there is no<br>
 room on the platform with Jesus for another Saviour, whether<br>
 Buddha, Mahomet, Dowie, Eddy, or what not. Jesus Christ is the<br>
 one foundation and it is gratuitous impudence for another to<br>
 assume the role of Foundation. <B>{Than that which is laid, which is<br>
 Christ Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\para ton keimenon, hos estin I&#275;sous Christos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "alongside <b><i>(\para\)</i></b> the one laid <b><i>(\keimenon\)</i></b>,"<br>
 already laid <b><i>(present middle participle of \keimai\, used here as<br>
 often as the perfect passive of \tith&#275;mi\ in place of<br>
 \tetheimenon\)</i></b>. Paul scouts the suggestion that one even in the<br>
 interest of so-called "new thought" will dare to lay beside Jesus<br>
 another foundation for religion. And yet I have seen an article<br>
 by a professor in a theological seminary in which he advocates<br>
 regarding Jesus as a landmark, not as a goal, not as a<br>
 foundation. Clearly Paul means that on this one true foundation,<br>
 Jesus Christ, one must build only what is in full harmony with<br>
 the Foundation which is Jesus Christ. If one accuses Paul of<br>
 narrowness, it can be replied that the architect has to be narrow<br>
 in the sense of building here and not there. A broad foundation<br>
 will be too thin and unstable for a solid and abiding structure.<br>
 It can be said also that Paul is here merely repeating the claim<br>
 of Jesus himself on this very subject when he quoted <!-#-->Ps<br>
 118:22f. to the members of the Sanhedrin who challenged his<br>
 authority <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 11:10f.; Mt 21:42-45; Lu 20:17f.)</i></b>. Apostles and<br>
 prophets go into this temple of God, but Christ Jesus is the<br>
 chief corner stone <b><i>(\akrog&#333;naios\, <!-#-->Eph 2:20)</i></b>. All believers are<br>
 living stones in this temple <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 2:5)</i></b>. But there is only one<br>
 foundation possible.<br>
 <br>
 3:12 <B>{Gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\chrusion, argurion, lithous timious, xula, chorton, kalam&#275;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 The durable materials are three <b><i>(gold, silver, marble or precious<br>
 stones)</i></b>, perishable materials <b><i>(pieces of wood, hay, stubble)</i></b>, "of<br>
 a palace on the one hand, of a mud hut on the other" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>.<br>
 Gold was freely used by the ancients in their palaces. Their<br>
 marble and granite pillars are still the wonder and despair of<br>
 modern men. The wooden huts had hay <b><i>(\chortos\, grass, as in <!-#-->Mr<br>
 6:39)</i></b> and stubble <b><i>(\kalam&#275;\, old word for stubble after the<br>
 grain is cut, here alone in the N.T., though in LXX as <!-#-->Ex 5:12)</i></b><br>
 which were employed to hold the wood pieces together and to<br>
 thatch the roof. It is not made clear whether Paul's metaphor<br>
 refers to the persons as in God's building in verse <!-#-->9 or to the<br>
 character of the teaching as in verse <!-#-->13. Probably both ideas<br>
 are involved, for look at the penalty on shoddy work <b><i>(verse <!-#-->15)</i></b><br>
 and shoddy men <b><i>(verse <!-#-->17)</i></b>. The teaching may not always be<br>
 vicious and harmful. It may only be indifferent and worthless. A<br>
 co-worker with God in this great temple should put in his very<br>
 best effort.<br>
 <br>
 3:13 <B>{The day}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; h&#275;mera\)</i></b>. The day of judgment as in <!-#-->1Th 5:4<br>
 <b><i>(which see)</i></b>, <!-#-->Ro 13:12; Heb 10:25. The work <b><i>(\ergon\)</i></b> of each<br>
 will be made manifest. There is no escape from this final<br>
 testing. <B>{It is revealed in fire}</B> <b><i>(\en puri apokaluptetai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Apparently "the day" is the subject of the verb, not the work,<br>
 not the Lord. See <!-#-->2Th 1:8; 2:8. This metaphor of fire was<br>
 employed in the O.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Da 7:9f.; Mal 4:1)</i></b> and by John the<br>
 Baptist <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 3:12; Lu 3:16f.)</i></b>. It is a metaphor that must not be<br>
 understood as purgatorial, but simple testing <b><i>(Ellicott)</i></b> as every<br>
 fire tests <b><i>(<B>{the fire itself will test}</B>, \to pur auto dokimasei\)</i></b><br>
 the quality of the material used in the building, <B>{of what sort<br>
 it is}</B> <b><i>(\hopoion estin\)</i></b>, qualitative relative pronoun. Men today<br>
 find, alas, that some of the fireproof buildings are not<br>
 fireproof when the fire actually comes.<br>
 <br>
 3:14 <B>{If any man's work shall abide}</B> <b><i>(\ei tinos to ergon menei\)</i></b>.<br>
 Condition of the first class with future indicative, determined<br>
 as fulfilled, assumed as true. When the fire has done its work,<br>
 what is left? That is the fiery test that the work of each of us<br>
 must meet. Suitable reward <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 20:8)</i></b> will come for the work<br>
 that stands this test <b><i>(gold, silver, precious stones)</i></b><br>
 <br>
 3:15 <B>{Shall be burned}</B> <b><i>(\kataka&#275;setai\)</i></b>. First-class condition<br>
 again, assumed as true. Second future <b><i>(late form)</i></b> passive<br>
 indicative of \katakai&#333;\, to burn down, old verb. Note perfective<br>
 use of preposition \kata\, shall be burned down. We usually say<br>
 "burned up," and that is true also, burned up in smoke. <B>{He shall<br>
 suffer loss}</B> <b><i>(\z&#275;mi&#333;th&#275;setai\)</i></b>. First future passive indicative<br>
 of \z&#275;mi&#333;\, old verb from \z&#275;mia\ <b><i>(damage, loss)</i></b>, to suffer loss.<br>
 In <!-#-->Mt 16:26; Mr 8:36; Lu 9:25 the loss is stated to be the<br>
 man's soul <b><i>(\psuch&#275;n\)</i></b> or eternal life. But here there is no such<br>
 total loss as that. The man's work <b><i>(\ergon\)</i></b> is burned up<br>
 <b><i>(sermons, lectures, books, teaching, all dry as dust)</i></b>. <B>{But he<br>
 himself shall be saved}</B> <b><i>(\autos de s&#333;th&#275;setai\)</i></b>. Eternal<br>
 salvation, but not by purgatory. His work is burned up completely<br>
 and hopelessly, but he himself escapes destruction because he is<br>
 really a saved man a real believer in Christ. <B>{Yet so as through<br>
 fire}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s de h&#333;s dia puros\)</i></b>. Clearly Paul means with his<br>
 work burned down <b><i>(verse <!-#-->15)</i></b>. It is the tragedy of a fruitless<br>
 life, of a minister who built so poorly on the true foundation<br>
 that his work went up in smoke. His sermons were empty froth or<br>
 windy words without edifying or building power. They left no mark<br>
 in the lives of the hearers. It is the picture of a wasted life.<br>
 The one who enters heaven by grace, as we all do who are saved,<br>
 yet who brings no sheaves with him. There is no garnered grain<br>
 the result of his labours in the harvest field. There are no<br>
 souls in heaven as the result of his toil for Christ, no<br>
 enrichment of character, no growth in grace.<br>
 <br>
 3:16 <B>{Ye are a temple of God}</B> <b><i>(\naos theou este\)</i></b>. Literally, a<br>
 sanctuary <b><i>(\naos\, not \hieron\, the sacred enclosure, but the<br>
 holy place and the most holy place)</i></b> of God. The same picture of<br>
 building as in verse <!-#-->9 <b><i>(\oikodom&#275;\)</i></b>, only here the sanctuary<br>
 itself. <B>{Dwelleth in you}</B> <b><i>(\en humin oikei\)</i></b>. The Spirit of God<br>
 makes his home <b><i>(\oikei\)</i></b> in us, not in temples made with hands<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 7:48; 17:24)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:17 <B>{Destroyeth}</B> <b><i>(\phtheirei\)</i></b>. The outward temple is merely the<br>
 symbol of God's presence, the Shechinah <b><i>(the Glory)</i></b>. God makes<br>
 his home in the hearts of his people or the church in any given<br>
 place like Corinth. It is a terrible thing to tear down<br>
 ruthlessly a church or temple of God like an earthquake that<br>
 shatters a building in ruins. This old verb \phtheir&#333;\ means to<br>
 corrupt, to deprave, to destroy. It is a gross sin to be a<br>
 church-wrecker. There are actually a few preachers who leave<br>
 behind them ruin like a tornado in their path. <B>{Him shall God<br>
 destroy}</B> <b><i>(\phtherei touton ho theos\)</i></b>. There is a solemn<br>
 repetition of the same verb in the future active indicative. The<br>
 condition is the first class and is assumed to be true. Then the<br>
 punishment is certain and equally effective. The church-wrecker<br>
 God will wreck. What does Paul mean by "will destroy"? Does he<br>
 mean punishment here or hereafter? May it not be both? Certainly<br>
 he does not mean annihilation of the man's soul, though it may<br>
 well include eternal punishment. There is warning enough here to<br>
 make every pastor pause before he tears a church to pieces in<br>
 order to vindicate himself. <B>{Holy}</B> <b><i>(\hagios\)</i></b>. Hence deserves<br>
 reverential treatment. It is not the building or house of which<br>
 Paul speaks as "the sanctuary of God" <b><i>(\ton naon tou theou\)</i></b>, but<br>
 the spiritual organization or organism of God's people in whom<br>
 God dwells, "which temple ye are" <b><i>(\hoitines este humeis\)</i></b>. The<br>
 qualitative relative pronoun \hoitines\ is plural to agree with<br>
 \humeis\ <b><i>(ye)</i></b> and refers to the holy temple just mentioned. The<br>
 Corinthians themselves in their angry disputes had forgotten<br>
 their holy heritage and calling, though this failing was no<br>
 excuse for the ringleaders who had led them on. In <!-#-->6:19 Paul<br>
 reminds the Corinthians again that the body is the temple<br>
 <b><i>(\naos\, sanctuary)</i></b> of the Holy Spirit, which fact they had<br>
 forgotten in their immoralities.<br>
 <br>
 3:18 <B>{Let no man deceive himself}</B> <b><i>(\M&#275;deis heauton exapat&#333;\)</i></b>. A<br>
 warning that implied that some of them were guilty of doing it<br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275;\ and the present imperative)</i></b>. Excited partisans can easily<br>
 excite themselves to a pious phrenzy, hypnotize themselves with<br>
 their own supposed devotion to truth. <B>{Thinketh that he is wise}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dokei sophos einai\)</i></b>. Condition of first class and assumed to<br>
 be true. Predicate nominative \sophos\ with the infinitive to<br>
 agree with subject of \dokei\ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1038)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul claimed to be "wise" himself in verse <!-#-->10 and he desires<br>
 that the claimant to wisdom may become wise <b><i>(\hina gen&#275;tai<br>
 sophos\, purpose clause with \hina\ and subjunctive)</i></b> by becoming<br>
 a fool <b><i>(\m&#333;ros genesth&#333;\, second aorist middle imperative of<br>
 \ginomai\)</i></b> as this age looks at him. This false wisdom of the<br>
 world <b><i>(<!-#-->1:18-20,23; 2:14)</i></b>, this self-conceit, has led to strife<br>
 and wrangling. Cut it out.<br>
 <br>
 3:19 <B>{Foolishness with God}</B> <b><i>(\m&#333;ria para t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>. Whose<br>
 standard does a church <b><i>(temple)</i></b> of God wish, that of this world<br>
 or of God? The two standards are not the same. It is a pertinent<br>
 inquiry with us all whose idea rules in our church. Paul quotes<br>
 <!-#-->Job 5:13. <B>{That taketh}</B> <b><i>(\ho drassomenos\)</i></b>. Old verb<br>
 \drassomai\, to grasp with the hand, is used here for the less<br>
 vivid word in the LXX \katalamban&#333;n\. It occurs nowhere else in<br>
 the N.T., but appears in the papyri to lay hands on. Job is<br>
 quoted in the N.T. only here and in <!-#-->Ro 11:35 and both times<br>
 with variations from the LXX. This word occurs in Ecclesiasticus<br>
 26:7; 34:2. In <!-#-->Ps 2:12 the LXX has \draxasthe paideias\, lay<br>
 hold on instruction. <B>{Craftiness}</B> <b><i>(\panourgi&#257;i\)</i></b>. The \panourgos\<br>
 man is ready for any or all work <b><i>(if bad enough)</i></b>. So it means<br>
 versatile cleverness <b><i>(Robertson and Plummer)</i></b>, _astutia_<br>
 <b><i>(Vulgate)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:20 <B>{And again}</B> <b><i>(\kai palin\)</i></b>. Another confirmatory passage from<br>
 <!-#-->Ps 94:11. <B>{Reasonings}</B> <b><i>(\dialogismous\)</i></b>. More than<br>
 _cogitationes_ <b><i>(Vulgate)</i></b>, sometimes disputations <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 2:14)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul changes "men" of LXX to wise <b><i>(\soph&#333;n\)</i></b> in harmony with the<br>
 Hebrew context. <B>{Vain}</B> <b><i>(\mataioi\)</i></b>. Useless, foolish, from<br>
 \mat&#275;\, a futile attempt.<br>
 <br>
 3:21 <B>{Wherefore let no one glory in men}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste m&#275;deis<br>
 kauchasth&#333; en anthr&#333;pois\)</i></b>. The conclusion <b><i>(\h&#333;ste\)</i></b> from the<br>
 self-conceit condemned. This particle here is merely inferential<br>
 with no effect on the construction <b><i>(\h&#333;s+te\ = and so)</i></b> any more<br>
 than \oun\ would have, a paratactic conjunction. There are thirty<br>
 such examples of \h&#333;ste\ in the N.T., eleven with the imperative<br>
 as here <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 999)</i></b>. The spirit of glorying in<br>
 party is a species of self-conceit and inconsistent with glorying<br>
 in the Lord <b><i>(<!-#-->1:31)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:22 <B>{Yours}</B> <b><i>(\hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Predicate genitive, belong to you. All<br>
 the words in this verse and <!-#-->23 are anarthrous, though not<br>
 indefinite, but definite. The English reproduces them all<br>
 properly without the definite article except \kosmos\ <b><i>(the<br>
 world)</i></b>, and even here just world will answer. Proper names do not<br>
 need the article to be definite nor do words for single objects<br>
 like world, life, death. Things present <b><i>(\enest&#333;ta\, second<br>
 perfect participle of \enist&#275;mi\)</i></b> and things to come divide two<br>
 classes. Few of the finer points of Greek syntax need more<br>
 attention than the absence of the article. We must not think of<br>
 the article as "omitted" <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 790)</i></b>. The<br>
 wealth of the Christian includes all things, all leaders, past,<br>
 present, future, Christ, and God. There is no room for partisan<br>
 wrangling here.<br>
