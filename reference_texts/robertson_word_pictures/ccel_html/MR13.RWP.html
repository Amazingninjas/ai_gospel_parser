<p>13:1 <B>{Master, behold, what manner of stones and what manner of<br>
 buildings}</B> <b><i>(\didaskale, ide potapoi lithoi kai potapai<br>
 oikodomai\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 24:1 and <!-#-->Lu 21:5 tell of the fact of the<br>
 comment, but Mark alone gives the precise words. Perhaps Peter<br>
 himself <b><i>(Swete)</i></b> was the one who sought thus by a pleasant<br>
 platitude to divert the Teacher's attention from the serious<br>
 topics of recent hours in the temple. It was not a new<br>
 observation, but the merest commonplace might serve at this<br>
 crisis. Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. xv. II, 3)</i></b> speaks of the great size of<br>
 these stones and the beauty of the buildings. Some of these<br>
 stones at the southeastern and southwestern angles survive today<br>
 and measure from twenty to forty feet long and weigh a hundred<br>
 tons. Jesus had, of course, often observed them.<br>
 <br>
 13:2 <B>{These great buildings}</B> <b><i>(\tautas tas oikodomas\)</i></b>. Jesus<br>
 fully recognizes their greatness and beauty. The more remarkable<br>
 will be their complete demolition <b><i>(\kataluth&#275;i\)</i></b>, <B>{loosened<br>
 down}</B>. Only the foundation stones remain.<br>
 <br>
 13:3 <B>{Over against the temple}</B> <b><i>(\katenanti tou hierou\)</i></b>. In full<br>
 view of the temple about which they had been speaking.<br>
 <B>{Privately}</B> <b><i>(\kat' idian\)</i></b>. Peter and James and John and Andrew<br>
 <b><i>(named only in Mark)</i></b> had evidently been discussing the strange<br>
 comment of Jesus as they were coming out of the temple. In their<br>
 bewilderment they ask Jesus a bit to one side, though probably<br>
 all the rest drew up as Jesus began to speak this great<br>
 eschatological discourse.<br>
 <br>
 13:4 <B>{Tell us, when shall these things be?}</B> <b><i>(\Eipon h&#275;min pote<br>
 tauta estai;\)</i></b>. The Revised Version punctuates it as a direct<br>
 question, but Westcott and Hort as an indirect inquiry. They<br>
 asked about the <B>{when}</B> <b><i>(\pote\)</i></b> and the <B>{what sign}</B> <b><i>(\ti<br>
 s&#275;meion\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 24:3 includes "the sign of thy coming and the end<br>
 of the world," showing that these tragic events are brought<br>
 before Jesus by the disciples. See discussion of the<br>
 interpretation of this discourse on &#175;Mt 24:3. This chapter in<br>
 Mark is often called "The Little Apocalypse" with the notion that<br>
 a Jewish apocalypse has been here adapted by Mark and attributed<br>
 to Jesus. Many of the theories attribute grave error to Jesus or<br>
 to the Gospels on this subject. The view adopted in the<br>
 discussion in Matthew is the one suggested here, that Jesus<br>
 blended in one picture his death, the destruction of Jerusalem<br>
 within that generation, the second coming and end of the world<br>
 typified by the destruction of the city. The lines between these<br>
 topics are not sharply drawn in the report and it is not possible<br>
 for us to separate the topics clearly. This great discourse is<br>
 the longest preserved in Mark and may be due to Peter. Mark may<br>
 have given it in order "to forewarn and forearm" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b> the<br>
 readers against the coming catastrophe of the destruction of<br>
 Jerusalem. Both Matthew <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 24)</i></b> and Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 21:5-36)</i></b> follow<br>
 the general line of Mark 13 though <!-#-->Mt 24:43-25:46 presents new<br>
 material <b><i>(parables)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:5 <B>{Take need that no man lead you astray}</B> <b><i>(\Blepete m&#275; tis<br>
 h&#8211;m&#257;s plan&#275;s&#275;i\)</i></b>. Same words in <!-#-->Mt 24:4. <!-#-->Lu 21:8 has it "that<br>
 ye be not led astray" <b><i>(\m&#275; plan&#275;th&#275;te\)</i></b>. This word \plana&#333;\ <b><i>(our<br>
 _planet_)</i></b> is a bold one. This warning runs through the whole<br>
 discussion. It is pertinent today after so many centuries. About<br>
 the false Christs then and now see on &#175;Mt 24:5. It is amazing<br>
 the success that these charlatans have through the ages in<br>
 winning the empty-pated to their hare-brained views. Only this<br>
 morning as I am writing a prominent English psychologist has<br>
 challenged the world to a radio communication with Mars asserting<br>
 that he has made frequent trips to Mars and communicated with its<br>
 alleged inhabitants. And the daily papers put his ebullitions on<br>
 the front page. For discussion of the details in verses <!-#-->6-8 see<br>
 on &#175;Mt 24:5-8. All through the ages in spite of the words of<br>
 Jesus men have sought to apply the picture here drawn to the<br>
 particular calamity in their time.<br>
 <br>
 13:7 <B>{Must needs come to pass}</B> <b><i>(\dei genesthai\)</i></b>. Already there<br>
 were outbreaks against the Jews in Alexandria, at Seleucia with<br>
 the slaughter of more than fifty thousand, at Jamnia, and<br>
 elsewhere. Caligula, Claudius, Nero will threaten war before it<br>
 finally comes with the destruction of the city and temple by<br>
 Titus in A.D. 70. Vincent notes that between this prophecy by<br>
 Jesus in A.D. 30 <b><i>(or 29)</i></b> and the destruction of Jerusalem there<br>
 was an earthquake in Crete <b><i>(A.D. 46 or 47)</i></b>, at Rome <b><i>(A.D. 51)</i></b>, at<br>
 Apamaia in Phrygia <b><i>(A.D. 60)</i></b>, at Campania <b><i>(A.D. 63)</i></b>. He notes<br>
 also four famines during the reign of Claudius A.D. 41-54. One of<br>
 them was in Judea in A.D. 44 and is alluded to in <!-#-->Ac 11:28.<br>
 Tacitus <b><i>(_Annals_ xvi. 10-13)</i></b> describes the hurricanes and storms<br>
 in Campania in A.D. 65.<br>
 <br>
 13:9 <B>{But take heed to yourselves}</B> <b><i>(\Blepete de humeis<br>
 heautous\)</i></b>. Only in Mark, but dominant note of warning all<br>
 through the discourse. Note \humeis\ here, very emphatic.<br>
 <B>{Councils}</B> <b><i>(\sunedria\)</i></b>. Same word as the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem.<br>
 These local councils <b><i>(\sun, hedra\, sitting together)</i></b> were<br>
 modelled after that in Jerusalem. <B>{Shall ye be beaten}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dar&#275;sesthe\)</i></b>. Second future passive indicative second person<br>
 plural. The word \der&#333;\ means to flay or skin and here has been<br>
 softened into <B>{beat}</B> like our tan or skin in the vernacular.<br>
 Aristophanes has it in this colloquial sense as have the papyri<br>
 in the _Koin&#275;_. Before governors and kings <b><i>(\epi h&#275;gemon&#333;n kai<br>
 basile&#333;n\)</i></b>. Gentile rulers as well as before Jewish councils.<br>
 <B>{Shall stand}</B> <b><i>(\stath&#275;sesthe\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative<br>
 second person plural of \hist&#275;mi\.<br>
 <br>
 13:10 <B>{Must first be preached}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;ton dei k&#275;ruchth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. This<br>
 only in Mark. It is interesting to note that Paul in <!-#-->Col 1:6,23<br>
 claims that the gospel has spread all over the world. All this<br>
 was before the destruction of Jerusalem.<br>
 <br>
 13:11 <B>{Be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;<br>
 promerimn&#257;te ti lal&#275;s&#275;te\)</i></b>. Negative with present imperative to<br>
 make a general prohibition or habit. Jesus is not here referring<br>
 to preaching, but to defences made before these councils and<br>
 governors. A typical example is seen in the courage and skill of<br>
 Peter and John before the Sanhedrin in Acts. The verb \merimna&#333;\<br>
 is from \meriz&#333;\ <b><i>(\meris\)</i></b>, to be drawn in opposite directions,<br>
 to be distracted. See on &#175;Mt 6:25. They are not to be stricken<br>
 with fright beforehand, but to face fearlessly those in high<br>
 places who are seeking to overthrow the preaching of the gospel.<br>
 There is no excuse here for the lazy preacher who fails to<br>
 prepare his sermon out of the mistaken reliance upon the Holy<br>
 Spirit. They will need and will receive the special help of the<br>
 Holy Spirit <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Joh 14-16)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:13 <B>{But he that endureth to the end}</B> <b><i>(\ho de hupomeinas eis<br>
 telos\)</i></b>. Note this aorist participle with the future verb. The<br>
 idea here is true to the etymology of the word, remaining under<br>
 <b><i>(\hupomen&#333;\)</i></b> until the end. The divisions in families Jesus had<br>
 predicted before <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 12:52f.; 14:25f.)</i></b>. <B>{Be saved}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\s&#333;th&#275;setai\)</i></b>. Here Jesus means final salvation <b><i>(effective<br>
 aorist future passive)</i></b>, not initial salvation.<br>
 <br>
 13:14 <B>{Standing where he ought not}</B> <b><i>(\hest&#275;kota hopou ou dei\)</i></b>.<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 24:15 has "standing in the holy place" <b><i>(\hestos en topoi<br>
 hagi&#333;i\)</i></b>, neuter and agreeing with \bdelugma\ <b><i>(abomination)</i></b>, the<br>
 very phrase applied in 1Macc. 1:54 to the altar to Zeus erected<br>
 by Antiochus Epiphanes where the altar to Jehovah was. Mark<br>
 personifies the abomination as personal <b><i>(masculine)</i></b>, while <!-#-->Lu<br>
 21:20 defines it by reference to the armies <b><i>(of Rome, as it<br>
 turned out)</i></b>. So the words of Daniel find a second fulfilment,<br>
 Rome taking the place of Syria <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 24:15 for<br>
 this phrase and the parenthesis inserted in the words of Jesus<br>
 <b><i>("Let him that readeth understand")</i></b>. See also on &#175;Mt 24:16-25<br>
 for discussion of details in <!-#-->Mr 13:14-22.<br>
 <br>
 13:16 <B>{In the field}</B> <b><i>(\eis ton agron\)</i></b>. Here <!-#-->Mt 24:18 has \en<br>
 t&#333;i agr&#333;i\, showing identical use of \eis\ with accusative and<br>
 \en\ with the locative.<br>
 <br>
 13:19 <B>{Which God created}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;n ektisen ho theos\)</i></b>. Note this<br>
 amplification to the quotation from <!-#-->Da 12:1.<br>
 <br>
 13:20 <B>{Whom he chose}</B> <b><i>(\hous exelexato\)</i></b>. Indirect aorist middle<br>
 indicative. In Mark alone. Explains the sovereign choice of God<br>
 in the end by and for himself.<br>
 <br>
 13:22 <B>{That they may lead astray}</B> <b><i>(\pros to apoplan&#257;in\)</i></b>. With a<br>
 view to leading off <b><i>(\pros\ and the infinitive)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 24:24 has<br>
 \h&#333;ste apopl&#257;sthai\, so as to lead off.<br>
 <br>
 13:23 <B>{But take ye heed}</B> <b><i>(\Humeis de blepete\)</i></b>. Gullibility is no<br>
 mark of a saint or of piety. Note emphatic position of you<br>
 <b><i>(\humeis\)</i></b>. Credulity ranks no higher than scepticism. God gave<br>
 us our wits for self-protection. Christ has warned us beforehand.<br>
 <br>
 13:24 <B>{The sun shall be darkened}</B> <b><i>(\ho helios skotisth&#275;setai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Future passive indicative. These figures come from the prophets<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 13:9f.; Eze 32:7f.; Joe 2:1f.,10f.; Am 8:9; Zep 1:14-16;<br>
 Zec 12:12)</i></b>. One should not forget that prophetic imagery was not<br>
 always meant to be taken literally, especially apocalyptic<br>
 symbols. Peter in <!-#-->Ac 2:15-21 applies the prophecy of Joel about<br>
 the sun and moon to the events on the day of Pentecost. See on<br>
 &#175;Mt 24:29-31 for details of verses <!-#-->24-27.<br>
 <br>
 13:25 <B>{The stars shall be falling}</B> <b><i>(\hoi asteres esontai<br>
 piptontes\)</i></b>. Periphrastic future indicative, \esontai\, future<br>
 middle indicative and \piptontes\, present active participle.<br>
 <br>
 13:27 <B>{Shall gather together his elect}</B> <b><i>(\episunaxei tous<br>
 eklektous autou\)</i></b>. This is the purpose of God through the ages.<br>
 <B>{From the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of<br>
 heaven}</B> <b><i>(\ap' akrou g&#275;s he&#333;s akrou ouranou\)</i></b>. The Greek is very<br>
 brief, "from the tip of earth to the tip of heaven." This precise<br>
 phrase occurs nowhere else.<br>
 <br>
 13:28 <B>{Coming to pass}</B> <b><i>(\ginomena\)</i></b>. Present middle participle,<br>
 linear action. See on &#175;Mt 24:32-36 for details of verses <!-#-->28-32<br>
 <b><i>(the Parable of the Fig Tree)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:32 <B>{Not even the Son}</B> <b><i>(\oude ho huios\)</i></b>. There is no doubt as<br>
 to the genuineness of these words here such as exists in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 24:36. This disclaimer of knowledge naturally interpreted<br>
 applies to the second coming, not to the destruction of Jerusalem<br>
 which had been definitely limited to that generation as it<br>
 happened in A.D. 70.<br>
 <br>
 13:34 <B>{Commanded also the porter to watch}</B> <b><i>(\kai t&#333;i thur&#333;r&#333;i<br>
 eneteilato hina gr&#275;gor&#275;i\)</i></b> . The porter or door-keeper<br>
 <b><i>(\thur&#333;ros\)</i></b>, as well as all the rest, to keep a watch <b><i>(present<br>
 subjunctive, \gr&#275;gor&#275;i\)</i></b>. This Parable of the Porter is only in<br>
 Mark. Our ignorance of the time of the Master's return is an<br>
 argument not for indifference nor for fanaticism, but for<br>
 alertness and eager readiness for his coming.<br>
 <br>
 13:35 The four watches of the night are named here: evening<br>
 <b><i>(\opse\)</i></b>, midnight <b><i>(\mesonuktion\)</i></b>, cock-crowing<br>
 <b><i>(\alektoroph&#333;nias\)</i></b>, morning <b><i>(\pr&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:37 <B>{Watch}</B> <b><i>(\gr&#275;goreite\)</i></b>. Be on the watch. Present imperative<br>
 of a verb made on the second perfect, \egr&#275;gora\, to be awake.<br>
 Stay awake till the Lord comes.<br>
