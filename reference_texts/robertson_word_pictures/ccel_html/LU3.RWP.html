<p>3:1 <B>{Now in the fifteenth year}</B> <b><i>(\en etei de pentekaidekat&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Tiberius Caesar was ruler in the provinces two years before<br>
 Augustus Caesar died. Luke makes a six-fold attempt here to<br>
 indicate the time when John the Baptist began his ministry. John<br>
 revived the function of the prophet <b><i>(\Ecce Homo\, p. <!-#-->2)</i></b> and it<br>
 was a momentous event after centuries of prophetic silence. Luke<br>
 begins with the Roman Emperor, then mentions Pontius Pilate<br>
 Procurator of Judea, Herod Antipas Tetrarch of Galilee <b><i>(and<br>
 Perea)</i></b>, Philip, Tetrarch of Iturea and Trachonitis, Lysanias,<br>
 Tetrarch of Abilene <b><i>(all with the genitive absolute construction)</i></b><br>
 and concludes with the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas<br>
 <b><i>(son-in-law and successor of Annas)</i></b>. The ancients did not have<br>
 our modern system of chronology, the names of rulers as here<br>
 being the common way. Objection has been made to the mention of<br>
 Lysanias here because Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. XXVII. I)</i></b> tells of a<br>
 Lysanias who was King of Abila up to B.C. 36 as the one referred<br>
 to by Luke with the wrong date. But an inscription has been found<br>
 on the site of Abilene with mention of "Lysanias the tetrarch"<br>
 and at the time to which Luke refers <b><i>(see my _Luke the Historian<br>
 in the Light of Research_, pp. 167f.)</i></b>. So Luke is vindicated<br>
 again by the rocks.<br>
 <br>
 3:2 <B>{The Word of God came unto John}</B> <b><i>(\egeneto rh&#275;ma theou epi<br>
 I&#333;an&#275;n\)</i></b>. The great epoch marked by \egeneto\ rather than \&#275;n\.<br>
 \Rh&#275;ma theou\ is some particular utterance of God <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>,<br>
 common in LXX, here alone in the N.T. Then John is introduced as<br>
 the son of Zacharias according to Chapter 1. Matthew describes<br>
 him as the Baptist, Mark as the Baptizer. No other Gospel<br>
 mentions Zacharias. Mark begins his Gospel here, but Matthew and<br>
 Luke have two Infancy Chapters before. Luke alone tells of the<br>
 coming of the word to John. All three Synoptics locate him "in<br>
 the wilderness" <b><i>(\en t&#275;i er&#275;m&#333;i\)</i></b> as here, <!-#-->Mr 1:4; Mt 3:1<br>
 <b><i>(adding "of Judea")</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:3 <B>{All the region round about Jordan}</B> <b><i>(\p&#257;san perich&#333;ron tou<br>
 Iordanou\)</i></b>. The wilderness was John's abode <b><i>(<!-#-->1:80)</i></b> so that he<br>
 began preaching where he was. It was the plain <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 13:10f.)</i></b> or<br>
 valley of the Jordan, El Ghor, as far north as Succoth <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ch<br>
 4:17)</i></b>. Sometimes he was on the eastern bank of the Jordan <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 10:40)</i></b>, though usually on the west side. His baptizing kept him<br>
 near the river. <B>{The baptism of repentance unto remission of<br>
 sins}</B> <b><i>(\baptisma metanoias eis aphesin hamarti&#333;n\)</i></b>. The same<br>
 phrase as in <!-#-->Mr 1:4, which see for discussion of these<br>
 important words. The word remission <b><i>(\aphesis\)</i></b> "occurs in Luke<br>
 more frequently than in all the other New Testament writers<br>
 combined" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. In medical writers it is used for the<br>
 relaxing of disease.<br>
 <br>
 3:4 <B>{As it is written}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s gegraptai\)</i></b>. The regular formula for<br>
 quotation, perfect passive indicative of \graph&#333;\. <B>{Isaiah the<br>
 prophet}</B> <b><i>(\Esaiou tou proph&#275;tou\)</i></b>. The same phrase in <!-#-->Mr 1:2<br>
 <b><i>(correct text)</i></b> and <!-#-->Mt 3:3. Mark, as we have seen, adds a<br>
 quotation from <!-#-->Mal 3:1 and Luke gives verses 4 and 5 of <!-#-->Isa.<br>
 40 not in Matthew or Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 3:5,6)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mt 3:3; Mr 1:3 for<br>
 discussion of Luke 4:4.<br>
 <br>
 3:5 <B>{Valley}</B> <b><i>(\pharagx\)</i></b>. Here only in the N.T., though in the<br>
 LXX and ancient Greek. It is a ravine or valley hedged in by<br>
 precipices. <B>{Shall be filled}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;r&#333;th&#275;setai\)</i></b>. Future passive<br>
 indicative of \pl&#275;ro&#333;\. In 1845 when the Sultan visited Brusa the<br>
 inhabitants were called out to clear the roads of rocks and to<br>
 fill up the hollows. Oriental monarchs often did this very thing.<br>
 A royal courier would go ahead to issue the call. So the Messiah<br>
 sends his herald <b><i>(John)</i></b> before him to prepare the way for him.<br>
 Isaiah described the preparation for the Lord's triumphal march<br>
 and John used it with great force. <B>{Hill}</B> <b><i>(\bounos\)</i></b>. Called a<br>
 Cyrenaic word by Herodotus, but later Greek writers use it as<br>
 does the LXX. <B>{Brought low}</B> <b><i>(\tapein&#333;th&#275;setai\)</i></b>. Future passive<br>
 indicative of \tapeino&#333;\. Literal meaning here of a verb common<br>
 in the metaphorical sense. <B>{Crooked}</B> <b><i>(\skolia\)</i></b>. Common word,<br>
 curved, opposite of \orthos\ or \euthus\, straight.<br>
 <br>
 3:6 <B>{All flesh}</B> <b><i>(\p&#257;sa sarx\)</i></b>. Used in the N.T. of the human race<br>
 alone, though in the LXX brutes are included. <B>{The salvation of<br>
 God}</B> <b><i>(\to sot&#275;rion tou theou\)</i></b>. The saving act of God. This<br>
 phrase aptly describes Luke's Gospel which has in mind the<br>
 message of Christ for all men. It is the universal Gospel.<br>
 <br>
 3:7 <B>{To the multitude that went out}</B> <b><i>(\tois exporeuomenois<br>
 ochlois\)</i></b>. Plural, <B>{Multitudes}</B>. The present participle also<br>
 notes the repetition of the crowds as does \elegen\ <b><i>(imperfect)</i></b>,<br>
 he used to say. <!-#-->Mt 3:7-10 singles out the message of John to<br>
 the Pharisees and Sadducees, which see for discussion of details.<br>
 Luke gives a summary of his preaching to the crowds with special<br>
 replies to these inquiries: the multitudes, <!-#-->10,11, the<br>
 publicans <!-#-->12,13, the soldiers <!-#-->14. <B>{To be baptized of him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\baptisth&#275;nai hup' autou\)</i></b>. This is the purpose of their coming.<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 3:7 has simply "to his baptism." John's metaphors are from<br>
 the wilderness <b><i>(vipers, fruits, axe, slave boy loosing sandals,<br>
 fire, fan, thrashing-floor, garner, chaff, stones)</i></b>. <B>{Who warned<br>
 you?}</B> <b><i>(\tis hepedeixen humin;\)</i></b>. The verb is like our "suggest"<br>
 by proof to eye, ear, or brain <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:47; 12:5; Ac 9:16; 20:35;<br>
 Mt 3:7)</i></b>. Nowhere else in the N.T. though common ancient word<br>
 <b><i>(\hupodeiknumi\, show under, point out, give a tip or private<br>
 hint)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:10 <B>{Asked}</B> <b><i>(\ep&#275;r&#333;t&#333;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense, repeatedly asked.<br>
 <B>{What then must we do?}</B> <b><i>(\ti oun poi&#275;s&#333;men;\)</i></b>. Deliberative<br>
 aorist subjunctive. More exactly, <B>{What then are we to do}</B>, <B>{What<br>
 then shall we do?}</B> Same construction in verses <!-#-->12,14. The \oun\<br>
 refers to the severe things already said by John <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 3:7-9)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:11 <B>{Coats}</B> <b><i>(\chit&#333;nas\)</i></b>. The inner and less necessary<br>
 undergarment. The outer indispensable \himation\ is not<br>
 mentioned. Note the specific and different message to each class.<br>
 John puts his finger on the weaknesses of the people right before<br>
 him.<br>
 <br>
 3:12 <B>{Also publicans}</B> <b><i>(\kai tel&#333;nai\)</i></b>. We have had the word<br>
 already in Matthew <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:46; 9:10; 11:19; 18:17; 21:31f.)</i></b> and<br>
 Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 11:15f.)</i></b>. It is sometimes coupled with harlots and<br>
 other sinners, the outcasts of society. The word is made up from<br>
 \telos\, tax, and \&#333;neomai\, to buy, and is an old one. The<br>
 renter or collector of taxes was not popular anywhere, but least<br>
 of all when a Jew collected taxes for the Romans and did it by<br>
 terrible graft and extortions. <B>{Extort}</B> <b><i>(\prassete\)</i></b>. The verb<br>
 means only to do or practice, but early the tax-collectors<br>
 learned how to "do" the public as regular "blood-suckers." Lucian<br>
 links them with crows and sycophants.<br>
 <br>
 3:14 <B>{Soldiers also}</B> <b><i>(\kai strateuomenoi\)</i></b>. Men on service,<br>
 _militantes_ rather than _milites_ <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. So Paul in <!-#-->2Ti<br>
 2:4. An old word like \strati&#333;t&#275;s\, soldier. Some of these<br>
 soldiers acted as police to help the publicans. But they were<br>
 often rough and cruel. <B>{Do violence to no man}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;dena<br>
 diaseis&#275;te\)</i></b>. Here only in the N.T., but in the LXX and common in<br>
 ancient Greek. It means to shake <b><i>(seismic disturbance,<br>
 earthquake)</i></b> thoroughly <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> and so thoroughly to terrify, to<br>
 extort money or property by intimidating <b><i>(3Macc. 7:21)</i></b>. The Latin<br>
 employs _concutere_, so. It was a process of blackmail to which<br>
 Socrates refers <b><i>(Xenophon, _Memorabilia_, ii. 9,1)</i></b>. This was a<br>
 constant temptation to soldiers. Might does not make right with<br>
 Jesus. <B>{Neither exact anything wrongfully}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;de<br>
 sukophant&#275;s&#275;te\)</i></b>. In Athens those whose business it was to inform<br>
 against any one whom they might find exporting figs out of Attica<br>
 were called fig-showers or sycophants <b><i>(\sukophantai\)</i></b>. From<br>
 \sukon\, fig, and \phain&#333;\, show. Some modern scholars reject<br>
 this explanation since no actual examples of the word meaning<br>
 merely a fig-shower have been found. But without this view it is<br>
 all conjectural. From the time of Aristophanes on it was used for<br>
 any malignant informer or calumniator. These soldiers were<br>
 tempted to obtain money by informing against the rich, blackmail<br>
 again. So the word comes to mean to accuse falsely. The<br>
 sycophants came to be a regular class of informers or slanderers<br>
 in Athens. Socrates is quoted by Xenophon as actually advising<br>
 Crito to employ one in self-defence, like the modern way of using<br>
 one gunman against another. Demosthenes pictures a sycophant as<br>
 one who "glides about the market like a scorpion, with his<br>
 venomous sting all ready, spying out whom he may surprise with<br>
 misfortune and ruin and from whom he can most easily extort<br>
 money, by threatening him with an action dangerous in its<br>
 consequences" <b><i>(quoted by Vincent)</i></b>. The word occurs only in Luke<br>
 in the N.T., here and in <!-#-->Lu 19:8 in the confession of Zaccheus.<br>
 It occurs in the LXX and often in the old Greek. <B>{Be content with<br>
 your wages}</B> <b><i>(\arkeisthe tois ops&#333;niois hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Discontent with<br>
 wages was a complaint of mercenary soldiers. This word for wages<br>
 was originally anything cooked <b><i>(\opson\, cooked food)</i></b>, and bought<br>
 <b><i>(from \&#333;neomai\, to buy)</i></b>. Hence, "rations," "pay," wages.<br>
 \Opsarion\, diminutive of \opson\, was anything eaten with bread<br>
 like broiled fish. So \ops&#333;nion\ comes to mean whatever is bought<br>
 to be eaten with bread and then a soldier's pay or allowance<br>
 <b><i>(Polybius, and other late Greek writers)</i></b> as in <!-#-->1Co 9:7. Paul<br>
 uses the singular of a preacher's pay <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:8)</i></b> and the plural<br>
 of the wages of sin <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 6:23)</i></b> = death <b><i>(death is the diet of<br>
 sin)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:15 <B>{Were in expectation}</B> <b><i>(\prosdok&#333;ntos\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute of<br>
 this striking verb already seen in <!-#-->1:21. <B>{Reasoned}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dialogizomen&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again. John's preaching<br>
 about the Messiah and the kingdom of God stirred the people<br>
 deeply and set them to wondering. <B>{Whether haply he were the<br>
 Christ}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;pote autos ei&#275; ho Christos\)</i></b>. Optative \ei&#275;\ in<br>
 indirect question changed from the indicative in the direct<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1031)</i></b>. John wrought no miracles and was<br>
 not in David's line and yet he moved people so mightily that they<br>
 began to suspect that he himself <b><i>(\autos\)</i></b> was the Messiah. The<br>
 Sanhedrin will one day send a formal committee to ask him this<br>
 direct question <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:19)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:16 <B>{He that is mightier than I}</B> <b><i>(\ho ischuroteros mou\)</i></b>. Like<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 1:7, "the one mightier than I." Ablative case <b><i>(\mou\)</i></b> of<br>
 comparison. John would not turn aside for the flattery of the<br>
 crowd. He was able to take his own measure in comparison with the<br>
 Messiah and was loyal to him <b><i>(see my _John the Loyal_)</i></b>. Compare<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 3:16 with <!-#-->Mr 1:7f. and <!-#-->Mt 3:11f. for discussion of<br>
 details. Luke has "fire" here after "baptize with the Holy Ghost"<br>
 as <!-#-->Mt 3:11, which see. This bold Messianic picture in the<br>
 Synoptic Gospels shows that John saw the Messiah's coming as a<br>
 judgment upon the world like fire and the fan of the<br>
 thrashing-floor, and with unquenchable fire for the chaff <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 3:17; Mt 3:12)</i></b>. But he had the spiritual conception also, the<br>
 baptism in the Holy Spirit which will characterize the Messiah's<br>
 Mission and so will far transcend the water baptism which marked<br>
 the ministry of John.<br>
 <br>
 3:18 <B>{Many other exhortations}</B> <b><i>(\polla men oun kai hetera\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, many and different things did John \evangelize\,<br>
 \euaggelizeto\, to the people. Luke has given a bare sample of<br>
 the wonderful messages of the Baptist. Few as his words preserved<br>
 are they give a definite and powerful conception of his<br>
 preaching.<br>
 <br>
 3:19 <B>{Reproved}</B> <b><i>(\elegchomenos\)</i></b>. Present passive participle of<br>
 \elegch&#333;\, an old verb meaning in Homer to treat with contempt,<br>
 then to convict <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 18:15)</i></b>, to expose <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph 5:11)</i></b>, to reprove<br>
 as here. The substantive \elegchos\ means proof <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 11:1)</i></b> and<br>
 \elegmos\, censure <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 3:16)</i></b>. Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. XVIII. V.4)</i></b><br>
 shows how repulsive this marriage was to Jewish feeling. <B>{Evil<br>
 things}</B> <b><i>(\pon&#275;r&#333;n\)</i></b>. Incorporated into the relative sentence. The<br>
 word is from \ponos, pone&#333;\, toil, work, and gives the active<br>
 side of evil, possibly with the notion of work itself as evil or<br>
 at least an annoyance. The "evil eye" <b><i>(\ophthalmos pon&#275;ros\ in<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 7:22)</i></b> was a "mischief working eye" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Mt 6:23<br>
 it is a diseased eye. So Satan is "the evil one" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:37;<br>
 6:13, etc.)</i></b>. It is a very common adjective in the N.T. as in the<br>
 older Greek. <B>{Had done}</B> <b><i>(\epoi&#275;sen\)</i></b>. Aorist active indicative,<br>
 not past perfect, merely a summary constative aorist, <B>{he did}</B>.<br>
 <br>
 3:20 <B>{Added}</B> <b><i>(\proseth&#275;ken\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative<br>
 <b><i>(kappa aorist)</i></b>. Common verb <b><i>(\prostith&#275;mi\)</i></b> in all Greek. In N.T.<br>
 chiefly in Luke and Acts. Hippocrates used it of applying wet<br>
 sponges to the head and Galen of applying a decoction of acorns.<br>
 There is no evidence that Luke has a medical turn to the word<br>
 here. The absence of the conjunction \hoti\ <b><i>(that)</i></b> before the<br>
 next verb \katekleisen\ <b><i>(shut up)</i></b> is asyndeton. This verb<br>
 literally means <B>{shut down}</B>, possibly with a reference to closing<br>
 down the door of the dungeon, though it makes sense as a<br>
 perfective use of the preposition, like our "shut up" without a<br>
 strict regard to the idea of "down." It is an old and common<br>
 verb, though here and <!-#-->Ac 26:10 only in the N.T. See <!-#-->Mt 14:3<br>
 for further statement about the prison.<br>
 <br>
 3:21 <B>{When all the people were baptised}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i baptisth&#275;nai<br>
 hapanta ton laon\)</i></b>. The use of the articular aorist infinitive<br>
 here with \en\ bothers some grammarians and commentators. There<br>
 is no element of time in the aorist infinitive. It is simply<br>
 punctiliar action, literally "in the being baptized as to all the<br>
 people." Luke does not say that all the people were baptized<br>
 before Jesus came or were baptized at the same time. It is merely<br>
 a general statement that Jesus was baptized in connexion with or<br>
 at the time of the baptizing of the people as a whole. <B>{Jesus<br>
 also having been baptized}</B> <b><i>(\kai I&#275;sou baptisthentos\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute construction, first aorist passive participle. In Luke's<br>
 sentence the baptism of Jesus is merely introductory to the<br>
 descent of the Holy Spirit and the voice of the Father. For the<br>
 narrative of the baptism see <!-#-->Mr 1:9; Mt 3:13-16. <B>{And praying}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai proseuchomenou\)</i></b>. Alone in Luke who so often mentions the<br>
 praying of Jesus. Present participle and so naturally meaning<br>
 that the heaven was opened while Jesus was praying though not<br>
 necessarily in answer to his prayer. <B>{The heaven was opened}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ane&#333;ichth&#275;nai ton ouranon\)</i></b>. First aorist passive infinitive<br>
 with double augment, whereas the infinitive is not supposed to<br>
 have any augment. The regular form would be \anoichth&#275;nai\ as in<br>
 D <b><i>(Codex Bezae)</i></b>. So the augment appears in the future indicative<br>
 \kateaxei\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 12:20)</i></b> and the second aorist passive subjunctive<br>
 \kateag&#333;sin\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:31)</i></b>. Such unusual forms appear in the<br>
 _Koin&#275;_. This infinitive here with the accusative of general<br>
 reference is the subject of \egeneto\ <b><i>(it came to pass)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 3:16 uses the same verb, but <!-#-->Mr 1:10 has \schizomenous\, rent<br>
 asunder.<br>
 <br>
 3:22 <B>{Descended}</B> <b><i>(\katab&#275;nai\)</i></b>. Same construction as the<br>
 preceding infinitive. <B>{The Holy Ghost}</B> <b><i>(\to pneuma to hagion\)</i></b>.<br>
 The Holy Spirit. <!-#-->Mr 1:10 has merely the Spirit <b><i>(\to pneuma\)</i></b><br>
 while <!-#-->Mt 3:16 has the Spirit of God <b><i>(\pneuma theou\)</i></b>. <B>{In a<br>
 bodily form}</B> <b><i>(\s&#333;matik&#333;i eidei\)</i></b>. Alone in Luke who has also "as<br>
 a dove" <b><i>(\h&#333;s peristeran\)</i></b> like Matthew and Mark. This probably<br>
 means that the Baptist saw the vision that looked like a dove.<br>
 Nothing is gained by denying the fact or possibility of the<br>
 vision that looked like a dove. God manifests his power as he<br>
 will. The symbolism of the dove for the Holy Spirit is<br>
 intelligible. We are not to understand that this was the<br>
 beginning of the Incarnation of Christ as the Cerinthian Gnostics<br>
 held. But this fresh influx of the Holy Spirit may have deepened<br>
 the Messianic consciousness of Jesus and certainly revealed him<br>
 to the Baptist as God's Son. <B>{And a voice came out of heaven}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai ph&#333;n&#275;n ex ouranou genesthai\)</i></b>. Same construction of<br>
 infinitive with accusative of general reference. The voice of the<br>
 Father to the Son is given here as in <!-#-->Mr 1:11, which see, and<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 3:17 for discussion of the variation there. The Trinity here<br>
 manifest themselves at the baptism of Jesus which constitutes the<br>
 formal entrance of Jesus upon his Messianic ministry. He enters<br>
 upon it with the Father's blessing and approval and with the<br>
 power of the Holy Spirit upon him. The deity of Christ here<br>
 appears in plain form in the Synoptic Gospels. The consciousness<br>
 of Christ is as clear on this point here as in the Gospel of John<br>
 where the Baptist describes him after his baptism as the Son of<br>
 God <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:34)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:23 <B>{Jesus Himself}</B> <b><i>(\autos I&#275;sous\)</i></b>. Emphatic intensive pronoun<br>
 calling attention to the personality of Jesus at this juncture.<br>
 When he entered upon his Messianic work. <B>{When he began to teach}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\archomenos\)</i></b>. The words "to teach" are not in the Greek text.<br>
 The Authorized Version "began to be about thirty years of age,"<br>
 is an impossible translation. The Revised Version rightly<br>
 supplies "to teach" <b><i>(\didaskein\)</i></b> after the present participle<br>
 \archomenos\. Either the infinitive or the participle can follow<br>
 \archomai\, usually the infinitive in the _Koin&#275;_. It is not<br>
 necessary to supply anything <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 1:22)</i></b>. <B>{Was about thirty years<br>
 of age}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n h&#333;sei et&#333;n triakonta\)</i></b>. Tyndale has it right "Jesus<br>
 was about thirty yere of age when he beganne." Luke does not<br>
 commit himself definitely to precisely thirty years as the age of<br>
 Christ. The Levites entered upon full service at that age, but<br>
 that proves nothing about Jesus. God's prophets enter upon their<br>
 task when the word of God comes to them. Jesus may have been a<br>
 few months under or over thirty or a year or two less or more.<br>
 <B>{Being Son <b><i>(as was supposed)</i></b> of Joseph, the son of Heli}</B> <b><i>(\&#333;n<br>
 huios h&#333;s enomizeto I&#333;s&#275;ph tou Helei\)</i></b>. For the discussion of the<br>
 genealogy of Jesus see on &#175;Mt 1:1-17. The two genealogies differ<br>
 very widely and many theories have been proposed about them. At<br>
 once one notices that Luke begins with Jesus and goes back to<br>
 Adam, the Son of God, while Matthew begins with Abraham and comes<br>
 to "Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus who is<br>
 called Christ" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 1:16)</i></b>. Matthew employs the word "begot" each<br>
 time, while Luke has the article \tou\ repeating \huiou\ <b><i>(Son)</i></b><br>
 except before Joseph. They agree in the mention of Joseph, but<br>
 Matthew says that "Jacob begat Joseph" while Luke calls "Joseph<br>
 the son of Heli." There are other differences, but this one makes<br>
 one pause. Joseph, of course, did not have two fathers. If we<br>
 understand Luke to be giving the real genealogy of Jesus through<br>
 Mary, the matter is simple enough. The two genealogies differ<br>
 from Joseph to David except in the cases of Zorobabel and<br>
 Salathiel. Luke evidently means to suggest something unusual in<br>
 his genealogy by the use of the phrase "as was supposed" <b><i>(\h&#333;s<br>
 enomizeto\)</i></b>. His own narrative in <!-#-->Lu 1:26-38 has shown that<br>
 Joseph was not the actual father of Jesus. Plummer objects that,<br>
 if Luke is giving the genealogy of Jesus through Mary, \huios\<br>
 must be used in two senses here <b><i>(son as was supposed of Joseph,<br>
 and grandson through Mary of Heli)</i></b>. But that is not an unheard of<br>
 thing. In neither list does Matthew or Luke give a complete<br>
 genealogy. Just as Matthew uses "begat" for descent, so does Luke<br>
 employ "son" in the same way for descendant. It was natural for<br>
 Matthew, writing for Jews, to give the legal genealogy through<br>
 Joseph, though he took pains to show in <!-#-->Mt 1:16,18-25 that<br>
 Joseph was not the actual father of Jesus. It was equally natural<br>
 for Luke, a Greek himself and writing for the whole world, to<br>
 give the actual genealogy of Jesus through Mary. It is in harmony<br>
 with Pauline universality <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b> that Luke carries the<br>
 genealogy back to Adam and does not stop with Abraham. It is not<br>
 clear why Luke adds "the Son of God" after Adam <b><i>(<!-#-->3:38)</i></b>.<br>
 Certainly he does not mean that Jesus is the Son of God only in<br>
 the sense that Adam is. Possibly he wishes to dispose of the<br>
 heathen myths about the origin of man and to show that God is the<br>
 Creator of the whole human race, Father of all men in that sense.<br>
 No mere animal origin of man is in harmony with this conception.<br>
