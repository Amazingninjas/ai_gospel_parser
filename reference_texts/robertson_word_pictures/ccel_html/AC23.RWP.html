<p>23:1 <B>{Looking steadfastly}</B> <b><i>(\atenisas\)</i></b>. See on this word <!-#-->1:10;<br>
 3:12; 6:15; 7:55; 13:9. Paul may have had weak eyes, but<br>
 probably the earnest gaze was to see if he recognized any faces<br>
 that were in the body that tried Stephen and to which he<br>
 apparently once belonged. <B>{I have lived before God}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pepoliteumai t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>. Perfect middle indicative of<br>
 \politeu&#333;\, old verb to manage affairs of city <b><i>(\polis\)</i></b> or<br>
 state, to be a citizen, behave as a citizen. In the N.T. only<br>
 here and <!-#-->Php 1:27. The idea of citizenship was Greek and Roman,<br>
 not Jewish. "He had lived as God's citizen, as a member of God's<br>
 commonwealth" <b><i>(Rackham)</i></b>. God <b><i>(\the&#333;i\)</i></b> is the dative of personal<br>
 interest. As God looked at it and in his relation to God. <B>{In all<br>
 good conscience unto this day}</B> <b><i>(\pas&#275;i suneid&#275;sei agath&#275;i achri<br>
 taut&#275;s t&#275;s h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. This claim seems to lack tact, but for<br>
 brevity's sake Paul sums up a whole speech in it. He may have<br>
 said much more than Luke here reports along the line of his<br>
 speech the day before, but Paul did not make this claim without<br>
 consideration. It appears to contradict his confession as the<br>
 chief of sinners <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 1:13-16)</i></b>. But that depends on one's<br>
 interpretation of "good conscience." The word \suneid&#275;sis\ is<br>
 literally "joint-knowledge" in Greek, Latin <b><i>(_conscientia_)</i></b> and<br>
 English "conscience" from the Latin. It is a late word from<br>
 \sunoida\, to know together, common in O.T., Apocrypha, Philo,<br>
 Plutarch, New Testament, Stoics, ecclesiastical writers. In<br>
 itself the word simply means consciousness of one's own thoughts<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 10:2)</i></b>, or of one's own self, then consciousness of the<br>
 distinction between right and wrong <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 2:15)</i></b> with approval or<br>
 disapproval. But the conscience is not an infallible guide and<br>
 acts according to the light that it has <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 8:7,10; 1Pe 2:19)</i></b>.<br>
 The conscience can be contaminated <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 10:22, evil \pon&#275;r&#257;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 All this and more must be borne in mind in trying to understand<br>
 Paul's description of his motives as a persecutor. Alleviation of<br>
 his guilt comes thereby, but not removal of guilt as he himself<br>
 felt <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 1:13-16)</i></b>. He means to say to the Sanhedrin that he<br>
 persecuted Christians as a conscientious <b><i>(though mistaken)</i></b> Jew<br>
 <b><i>(Pharisee)</i></b> just as he followed his conscience in turning from<br>
 Judaism to Christianity. It is a pointed disclaimer against the<br>
 charge that he is a renegade Jew, an opposer of the law, the<br>
 people, the temple. Paul addresses the Sanhedrin as an equal and<br>
 has no "apologies" <b><i>(in our sense)</i></b> to make for his career as a<br>
 whole. The golden thread of consistency runs through, as a good<br>
 citizen in God's commonwealth. He had the consolation of a good<br>
 conscience <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 3:16)</i></b>. The word does not occur in the Gospels<br>
 and chiefly in Paul's Epistles, but we see it at work in <!-#-->Joh<br>
 8:9 <b><i>(the interpolation <!-#-->7:53-8:11)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 23:2 <B>{Ananias}</B> <b><i>(\Hananias\)</i></b>. Not the one in <!-#-->Lu 3:2; Joh 18:13;<br>
 Ac 4:7, but the son of Nebedaeus, nominated high priest by<br>
 Herod, King of Chalcis, A.D. 48 and till A.D. 59. He was called<br>
 to Rome A.D. 52 to answer "a charge of rapine and cruelty made<br>
 against him by the Samaritans, but honourably acquitted" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>.<br>
 Though high priest, he was a man of bad character. <B>{Them that<br>
 stood by him}</B> <b><i>(\tois parest&#333;sin aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Dative case of second<br>
 perfect participle of \parist&#275;mi\, to place, and intransitive.<br>
 See the same form in verse <!-#-->4 <b><i>(\parest&#333;tes\)</i></b>. <B>{To smite him on<br>
 the mouth}</B> <b><i>(\tuptein autou to stoma\)</i></b>. See on &#175;12:45; 18:17. Cf.<br>
 the treatment of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:22)</i></b>. Ananias was provoked by<br>
 Paul's self-assertion while on trial before his judges. "The act<br>
 was illegal and peculiarly offensive to a Jew at the hands of a<br>
 Jew" <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. More self-control might have served Paul better.<br>
 Smiting the mouth or cheek is a peculiarly irritating offence and<br>
 one not uncommon among the Jews and this fact gives point to the<br>
 command of Jesus to turn the other check <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:29 where \tupt&#333;\<br>
 is also used)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 23:3 <B>{Thou whited wall}</B> <b><i>(\toiche kekoniamene\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle of \konia&#333;\ <b><i>(from \konia\, dust or lime)</i></b>. The same<br>
 word used in <!-#-->Mt 23:27 for "whited sepulchres" <b><i>(\taphoi<br>
 kekoniamenoi\)</i></b> which see. It is a picturesque way of calling<br>
 Ananias a hypocrite, undoubtedly true, but not a particularly<br>
 tactful thing for a prisoner to say to his judge, not to say<br>
 Jewish high priest. Besides, Paul had hurled back at him the word<br>
 \tuptein\ <b><i>(smite)</i></b> in his command, putting it first in the<br>
 sentence <b><i>(\tuptein se mellei ho theos\)</i></b> in strong emphasis.<br>
 Clearly Paul felt that he, not Ananias, was living as a good<br>
 citizen in God's commonwealth. <B>{And sittest thou to judge me?}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Kai su kath&#275;i krin&#333;n me?\)</i></b> Literally, "And thou <b><i>(being what<br>
 thou art)</i></b> art sitting <b><i>(\kath&#275;i\, second person singular middle of<br>
 \kath&#275;mai\, late form for \kath&#275;sai\, the uncontracted form)</i></b><br>
 judging me." Cf. <!-#-->Lu 22:30. \Kai su\ at the beginning of a<br>
 question expresses indignation. <B>{Contrary to the law}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\paranom&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present active participle of \paranome&#333;\, old verb<br>
 to act contrary to the law, here alone in the N.T., "acting<br>
 contrary to the law."<br>
 <br>
 23:4 <B>{Of God}</B> <b><i>(\tou theou\)</i></b>. As God's representative in spite of<br>
 his bad character <b><i>(<!-#-->De 17:8f.)</i></b>. Here was a charge of<br>
 irreverence, to say the least. The office called for respect.<br>
 <br>
 23:5 <B>{I wist not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk &#275;idein\)</i></b>. Second past perfect of \oida\<br>
 used as an imperfect. The Greek naturally means that Paul did not<br>
 know that it was the high priest who gave the order to smite his<br>
 mouth. If this view is taken, several things may be said by way<br>
 of explanation. The high priest may not have had on his official<br>
 dress as the meeting was called hurriedly by Lysias. Paul had<br>
 been away so long that he may not have known Ananias on sight.<br>
 And then Paul may have had poor eyesight or the high priest may<br>
 not have been sitting in the official seat. Another way of<br>
 explaining it is to say that Paul was so indignant, even angry,<br>
 at the command that he spoke without considering who it was that<br>
 gave the order. The Greek allows this idea also. At any rate Paul<br>
 at once recognizes the justice of the point made against him. He<br>
 had been guilty of irreverence against the office of high priest<br>
 as the passage from <!-#-->Ex 22:18 <b><i>(LXX)</i></b> shows and confesses his<br>
 fault, but the rebuke was deserved. Jesus did not threaten <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe<br>
 2:23)</i></b> when smitten on the cheek <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:22)</i></b>, but he did<br>
 protest against the act and did not turn the other cheek.<br>
 <br>
 23:6 <B>{But when Paul perceived}</B> <b><i>(\gnous de ho Paulos\)</i></b>. Perceiving<br>
 <b><i>(second aorist ingressive of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b>. Paul quickly saw that<br>
 his cause was ruined before the Sanhedrin by his unwitting attack<br>
 on the high priest. It was impossible to get a fair hearing.<br>
 Hence, Vincent says, "Paul, with great tact, seeks to bring the<br>
 two parties of the council into collision with each other." So<br>
 Alford argues with the motto "divide and conquer." Farrar<br>
 condemns Paul and takes <!-#-->24:21 as a confession of error here,<br>
 but that is reading into Paul's word about the resurrection more<br>
 than he says. Page considers Luke's report meagre and<br>
 unsatisfactory. Rackham thinks that the trial was already started<br>
 and that Paul repeated part of his speech of the day before when<br>
 "the Sadducees received his words with ostentatious scepticism<br>
 and ridicule: this provoked counter-expressions of sympathy and<br>
 credulity among the Pharisees." But all this is inference. We do<br>
 not have to adopt the Jesuitical principle that the end justifies<br>
 the means in order to see shrewdness and hard sense in what Paul<br>
 said and did. Paul knew, of course, that the Sanhedrin was nearly<br>
 evenly divided between Pharisees and Sadducees, for he himself<br>
 had been a Pharisee. <B>{I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees}</B> <b><i>(\Eg&#333;<br>
 Pharisaios eimi huios Pharisai&#333;n\)</i></b>. This was strictly true as we<br>
 know from his Epistles <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 3:5)</i></b>. <B>{Touching the hope and<br>
 resurrection of the dead I am called in question}</B> <b><i>(\peri elpidos<br>
 kai anastase&#333;s nekr&#333;n krinomai\)</i></b>. This was true also and this is<br>
 the point that Paul mentions in <!-#-->24:21. His failure to mention<br>
 again the fact that he was a Pharisee throws no discredit on<br>
 Luke's report here. The chief point of difference between<br>
 Pharisees and Sadducees was precisely this matter of the<br>
 resurrection. And this was Paul's cardinal doctrine as a<br>
 Christian minister. It was this fact that convinced him that<br>
 Jesus was the Messiah and was "the very centre of his faith"<br>
 <b><i>(Page)</i></b> and of his preaching. It was not a mere trick for Paul to<br>
 proclaim this fact here and so divide the Sanhedrin. As a matter<br>
 of fact, the Pharisees held aloof when the Sadducees persecuted<br>
 Peter and the other apostles for preaching resurrection in the<br>
 case of Jesus and even Gamaliel threw cold water on the effort to<br>
 punish them for it <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 5:34-39)</i></b>. So then Paul was really<br>
 recurring to the original cleavage on this point and was able to<br>
 score a point against the Sadducees as Gamaliel, his great<br>
 teacher, had done before him. Besides, "Paul and Pharisaism seem<br>
 to us such opposite ideas that we often forget that to Paul<br>
 Christianity was the natural development of Judaism" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 shows this in <!-#-->Ga 3; Ro 9-11.<br>
 <br>
 23:7 <B>{When he had so said}</B> <b><i>(\touto autou lalountos\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute of present participle <b><i>(Westcott and Hort)</i></b> rather than<br>
 aorist <b><i>(\eipontos\)</i></b>. While he was saying this. <B>{A dissension}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\stasis\)</i></b>. This old word for standing or station <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 9:8)</i></b><br>
 from \hist&#275;mi\, to place, we have seen already to mean<br>
 insurrection <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 19:40 which see)</i></b>. Here it is strife as in<br>
 <!-#-->15:2. <B>{Was divided}</B> <b><i>(\eschisth&#275;\)</i></b>. See on &#175;14:4.<br>
 <br>
 23:8 <B>{There is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;<br>
 einai anastasin m&#275;te aggelon m&#275;te pneuma\)</i></b>. Infinitive with<br>
 negative \m&#275;\ in indirect assertion. These points constitute the<br>
 chief doctrinal differences between the Pharisees and the<br>
 Sadducees. <B>{Both}</B> <b><i>(\amphotera\)</i></b>. Here used though three items of<br>
 belief are mentioned as in <!-#-->19:16 where the seven sons of Sceva<br>
 are thus described. This idiom is common enough in papyri and<br>
 Byzantine Greek <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 745)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 23:9 <B>{Strove}</B> <b><i>(\diemachonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of \diamachomai\,<br>
 old Attic verb, to fight it out <b><i>(between, back and forth,<br>
 fiercely)</i></b>. Here only in the N.T. It was a lively scrap and Luke<br>
 pictures it as going on. The Pharisees definitely take Paul's<br>
 side. <B>{And what if a spirit hath spoken to him or an angel?}</B> <b><i>(\ei<br>
 de pneuma elal&#275;sen aut&#333;i &#275; aggelos?\)</i></b>. This is aposiopesis, not<br>
 uncommon in the N.T., as in <!-#-->Lu 13:9; Joh 6:62 <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 1203)</i></b>. See one also in <!-#-->Ex 32:32.<br>
 <br>
 23:10 <B>{When there arose a great dissension}</B> <b><i>(\poll&#275;s t&#275;s<br>
 ginomen&#275;s stase&#333;s\)</i></b>. Present middle participle <b><i>(genitive<br>
 absolute)</i></b>. Literally, "dissension becoming much." <B>{Lest Paul<br>
 should be torn in pieces by them}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; diaspasth&#275;i ho Paulos\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive subjunctive of \diaspa&#333;\, to draw in two, to<br>
 tear in pieces, old verb, in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mr 5:4 of<br>
 tearing chains in two. The subjunctive with \m&#275;\ is the common<br>
 construction after a verb of fearing <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 995)</i></b>. <B>{The soldiers}</B> <b><i>(\to strateuma\)</i></b>. The army, the band of<br>
 soldiers and so in verse <!-#-->27. <B>{To go down}</B> <b><i>(\kataban\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active participle of \katabain&#333;\, having gone down. <B>{Take<br>
 him by force}</B> <b><i>(\harpasai\)</i></b>. To seize. The soldiers were to seize<br>
 and save Paul from the midst of <b><i>(\ek mesou\)</i></b> the rabbis or<br>
 preachers <b><i>(in their rage to get at each other)</i></b>. Paul was more of<br>
 a puzzle to Lysias now than ever.<br>
 <br>
 23:11 <B>{The night following}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i epious&#275;i nukti\)</i></b>. Locative<br>
 case, on the next <b><i>(following)</i></b> night. <B>{The Lord}</B> <b><i>(\ho kurios\)</i></b>.<br>
 Jesus. Paul never needed Jesus more than now. On a previous<br>
 occasion the whole church prayed for Peter's release <b><i>(<!-#-->12:5)</i></b>,<br>
 but Paul clearly had no such grip on the church as that, though<br>
 he had been kindly welcomed <b><i>(<!-#-->21:18)</i></b>. In every crisis Jesus<br>
 appears to him <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ac 18:9)</i></b>. It looked dark for Paul till<br>
 Jesus spoke. Once before in Jerusalem Jesus spoke words of cheer<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->22:18)</i></b>. Then he was told to leave Jerusalem. Now he is to have<br>
 "cheer" or "courage" <b><i>(\tharsei\)</i></b>. Jesus used this very word to<br>
 others <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 9:2,22; Mr 10:49)</i></b>. It is a brave word. <B>{Thou hast<br>
 testified}</B> <b><i>(\diemartur&#333;\)</i></b>. First aorist middle indicative second<br>
 person singular of \diamarturomai\, strong word <b><i>(see on &#175;22:18)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Must thou}</B> <b><i>(\se dei\)</i></b>. That is the needed word and on this Paul<br>
 leans. His hopes <b><i>(<!-#-->19:21)</i></b> of going to Rome will not be in vain.<br>
 He can bide Christ's time now. And Jesus has approved his witness<br>
 in Jerusalem.<br>
 <br>
 23:12 <B>{Banded together}</B> <b><i>(\poi&#275;santes sustroph&#275;n\)</i></b>. See on <!-#-->19:40<br>
 <b><i>(riot)</i></b>, but here conspiracy, secret combination, binding together<br>
 like twisted cords. <B>{Bound themselves under a curse}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anethematisan heautous\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of<br>
 \anathematiz&#333;\, a late word, said by Cremer and Thayer to be<br>
 wholly Biblical or ecclesiastical. But Deissmann <b><i>(_Light from the<br>
 Ancient East_, p. 95)</i></b> quotes several examples of the verb in an<br>
 Attic cursing tablet from Megara of the first or second century<br>
 A.D. This proof shows that the word, as well as \anathema\<br>
 <b><i>(substantive)</i></b> from which the verb is derived, was employed by<br>
 pagans as well as by Jews. Deissmann suggests that Greek Jews<br>
 like the seven sons of Sceva may have been the first to coin it.<br>
 It occurs in the LXX as well as <!-#-->Mr 14:71 <b><i>(which see and <!-#-->Luke<br>
 21:5)</i></b>; <!-#-->Ac 23:12,14,21. They placed themselves under an<br>
 anathema or curse, devoted themselves to God <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Le 27:28f.;<br>
 1Co 16:22)</i></b>. <B>{Drink}</B> <b><i>(\pein=piein\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 infinitive of \pin&#333;\. For this shortened form see Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 343. <B>{Till they had killed}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s hou<br>
 apoktein&#333;sin\)</i></b>. First aorist active subjunctive of \apoktein&#333;\,<br>
 common verb. No reason to translate "had killed," simply "till<br>
 they should kill," the aorist merely punctiliar action, the<br>
 subjunctive retained instead of the optative for vividness as<br>
 usual in the _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 974-6)</i></b>. Same<br>
 construction in verse <!-#-->14. King Saul took an "anathema" that<br>
 imperilled Jonathan <b><i>(<!-#-->1Sa 14:24)</i></b>. Perhaps the forty felt that<br>
 the rabbis could find some way to absolve the curse if they<br>
 failed. See this verse repeated in verse <!-#-->21.<br>
 <br>
 23:13 <B>{More than forty}</B> <b><i>(\pleious tesserakonta\)</i></b>. Without "than"<br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;\)</i></b> as in verse <!-#-->21; 24:11 and often in the ancient Greek.<br>
 <B>{Conspiracy}</B> <b><i>(\sun&#333;mosian\)</i></b>. Old word from \sunomnumi\, to swear<br>
 together. Only here in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 23:14 <B>{Came to the chief priests and the elders}</B> <b><i>(\proselthontes<br>
 tois archiereusin kai tois presbuterois\)</i></b>. The Sanhedrin, just as<br>
 Judas did <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:4)</i></b>. <B>{With a great curse}</B> <b><i>(\anathemati\)</i></b>. This<br>
 use of the same word as the verb repeated in the instrumental<br>
 case is in imitation of the Hebrew absolute infinitive and common<br>
 in the LXX, the very idiom and words of <!-#-->De 13:15; 20:17, an<br>
 example of translation Greek, though found in other languages<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 531)</i></b>. See on &#175;Lu 21:5 for the<br>
 distinction between \anathema\ and \anath&#275;ma\. Jesus had<br>
 foretold: "Whoso killeth you will think that he doeth God<br>
 service" <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 16:2)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 23:15 <B>{Ye}</B> <b><i>(\humeis\)</i></b>. Emphatic. <B>{Signify}</B> <b><i>(\emphanisate\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active imperative of \emphaniz&#333;\. Make plain from<br>
 \emphan&#275;s\, chiefly in Acts. Repeated in verse <!-#-->22. The<br>
 authority is with the chiliarch not with the Sanhedrin, but he<br>
 had appealed to the Sanhedrin for advice. <B>{As though ye would<br>
 judge of his case more exactly}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s mellontas diagin&#333;skein<br>
 akribesteron ta peri autou\)</i></b>. \H&#333;s\ with the participle gives the<br>
 alleged reason as here. So also in verse <!-#-->20. \Diagnosk&#333;\, old<br>
 verb to distinguish accurately, only here in N.T. and <!-#-->24:22.<br>
 <B>{Or ever come near}</B> <b><i>(\pro tou eggisai auton\)</i></b>. "Before the coming<br>
 near as to him." \Pro\ and the genitive of the articular<br>
 infinitive of \eggiz&#333;\ with accusative of general reference. <B>{We<br>
 are ready to slay him}</B> <b><i>(\hetoimoi esmen tou anelein auton\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive of purpose of the articular infinitive after the<br>
 adjective \hetoimoi\ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1061)</i></b>. \Anelein\,<br>
 second aorist active of \anaire&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 23:16 <B>{Their lying in wait}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n enedran\)</i></b>. Old word from \en\<br>
 <b><i>(in)</i></b> and \hedra\ <b><i>(seat)</i></b>, ambush. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->25:3.<br>
 Accusative object of \akousas\. <B>{He came}</B> <b><i>(\paragenomenos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist middle participle of \paraginomai\. It may mean,<br>
 "having come upon them" and so discount their plot, a graphic<br>
 touch. Vincent thinks that some Pharisee, since Paul was a<br>
 Pharisee and so a member of the "guild," told his nephew of the<br>
 plot. Perhaps, and perhaps not. <B>{Told Paul}</B> <b><i>(\ap&#275;ggeilen t&#333;i<br>
 Paul&#333;i\)</i></b>. This nephew is not known otherwise. He may be a student<br>
 here from Tarsus as Paul once was. Anyhow he knows what to do<br>
 when he catches on to the conspirators. He had enough address to<br>
 get into the barracks where Paul was. He ran the risk of death if<br>
 discovered.<br>
 <br>
 23:17 <B>{Called unto him}</B> <b><i>(\proskalesamenos\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 participle indirect middle, calling to himself. Paul laid his<br>
 plans as energetically as if Jesus had not promised that he would<br>
 see Rome <b><i>(<!-#-->23:11)</i></b>. <B>{Bring}</B> <b><i>(\apage\)</i></b>. "Take away."<br>
 <br>
 23:18 <B>{Paul the prisoner}</B> <b><i>(\ho desmios Paulos\)</i></b>. Bound<br>
 <b><i>(\desmios\)</i></b> to a soldier, but not with two chains <b><i>(<!-#-->21:33)</i></b>, and<br>
 with some freedom to see his friends as later <b><i>(<!-#-->28:16)</i></b>, in<br>
 military custody <b><i>(_custodia militaris_)</i></b>. This was better than<br>
 _custodia publica_ <b><i>(public custody)</i></b>, the common prison, but more<br>
 confining. <B>{Who hath something to say to thee}</B> <b><i>(\echonta ti<br>
 lal&#275;sai soi\)</i></b>. Same idiom as in verse <!-#-->17,19, but \lal&#275;sai\ here<br>
 instead of \apaggeilai\.<br>
 <br>
 23:19 <B>{Took him by the hand}</B> <b><i>(\epilabomenos t&#275;s cheiros autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Kindly touch in Lysias, _ut fiduciam adolescentis confirmaret_<br>
 <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>. Note genitive with the second aorist middle <b><i>(indirect,<br>
 to himself)</i></b> of \epilamban&#333;\ as in <!-#-->Lu 8:54 with \krat&#275;sas\ which<br>
 see. How old the young man <b><i>(\neanias\)</i></b> was we do not know, but it<br>
 is the very word used of Paul in <!-#-->7:58 when he helped in the<br>
 killing of Stephen, a young man in the twenties probably. See<br>
 also <!-#-->20:9 of Eutychus. He is termed \neaniskos\ in verse <!-#-->22.<br>
 <B>{Asked him privately}</B> <b><i>(\kat' idian epunthaneto\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 middle, began to ask <b><i>(inchoative)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 23:20 <B>{The Jews}</B> <b><i>(\hoi Ioudaioi\)</i></b>. As if the whole nation was in<br>
 the conspiracy and so in verse <!-#-->12. The conspirators may have<br>
 belonged to the Zealots, but clearly they represented the state<br>
 of Jewish feeling toward Paul in Jerusalem. <B>{Have agreed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sunethento\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle indicative of \suntith&#275;mi\,<br>
 old verb to join together, to agree. Already this form in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 22:5 which see. See also <!-#-->Joh 9:22; Ac 24:9. <B>{To bring down}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hop&#333;s katagag&#275;is\)</i></b>. Very words of the conspirators in verse<br>
 <!-#-->15 as if the young man overheard. Second aorist active<br>
 subjunctive of \katag&#333;\ with \hop&#333;s\ in final clause, still used,<br>
 but nothing like so common as \hina\ though again in verse <!-#-->23<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 985)</i></b>. <B>{As though thou wouldest inquire}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\h&#333;s mell&#333;n punthanesthai\)</i></b>. Just as in verse <!-#-->15 except that<br>
 here \mell&#333;n\ refers to Lysias instead of to the conspirators as<br>
 in verse <!-#-->15. The singular is used by the youth out of deference<br>
 to the authority of Lysias and so modifies a bit the scheming of<br>
 the conspirators, not "absurd" as Page holds.<br>
 <br>
 23:21 <B>{Do not therefore yield unto them}</B> <b><i>(\Su oun m&#275; peisth&#275;is<br>
 autois\)</i></b>. First aorist passive subjunctive of \peith&#333;\, common<br>
 verb, here to be persuaded by, to listen to, to obey, to yield<br>
 to. With negative and rightly. Do not yield to them <b><i>(dative)</i></b> at<br>
 all. On the aorist subjunctive with \m&#275;\ in prohibitions against<br>
 committing an act see Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 851-4. <B>{For there<br>
 lie in wait}</B> <b><i>(\enedreuousin gar\)</i></b>. Present active indicative of<br>
 \enedreu&#333;\, old verb from \enedra\ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->16)</i></b>, in the N.T. only<br>
 here and <!-#-->Lu 11:54 which see. <B>{Till they have slain him}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s<br>
 hou anel&#333;sin auton\)</i></b>. Same idiom as in verse <!-#-->12 save that here<br>
 we have \anel&#333;sin\ <b><i>(second aorist active subjunctive)</i></b> instead of<br>
 \apoktein&#333;sin\ <b><i>(another word for kill)</i></b>, "till they slay him."<br>
 <B>{Looking for the promise from thee}</B> <b><i>(\prosdechomenoi t&#275;n apo sou<br>
 epaggelian\)</i></b>. This item is all that is needed to put the scheme<br>
 through, the young man shrewdly adds.<br>
 <br>
 23:22 <B>{Tell no man}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;deni eklal&#275;sai\)</i></b>. Indirect command<br>
 <b><i>(_oratio obliqua_)</i></b> after \paraggeilas\ <b><i>(charging)</i></b> with first<br>
 aorist active infinitive of \eklale&#333;\ <b><i>(in ancient Greek, but here<br>
 only in N.T.)</i></b>, but construction changed to direct in rest of the<br>
 sentence <b><i>(_oratio recta_)</i></b> as in <!-#-->1:4, "that thou hast signified<br>
 these things to me" <b><i>(\hoti tauta enephanisas pros eme\)</i></b>. Same<br>
 verb here as in verse <!-#-->15. This change is common in the N.T.<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1047)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 23:23 <B>{Two}</B> <b><i>(\tinas duo\)</i></b>. "Some two" as in <!-#-->Lu 7:19, indicating<br>
 <b><i>(Page)</i></b> that they were not specially chosen. <B>{Soldiers}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\strati&#333;tas\)</i></b>, <B>{horsemen}</B> <b><i>(\hippeis\)</i></b>, <B>{spearmen}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dexiolabous\)</i></b>. The three varieties of troops in a Roman army<br>
 like the cohort of Lysias <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. The \strati&#333;tai\ were the<br>
 heavy-armed legionaries, the \hippeis\ belonged to every legion,<br>
 the \dexiolaboi\ were light-armed supplementary troops who<br>
 carried a lance in the right hand <b><i>(\dexios\, right, \lamban&#333;\, to<br>
 take)</i></b>. Vulgate, _lancearios_. At the third hour of the night<br>
 <b><i>(\apo trit&#275;s h&#333;ras t&#275;s nuktos\)</i></b>. About nine in the evening.<br>
 <br>
 23:24 <B>{Provide beasts}</B> <b><i>(\kten&#275; parast&#275;sai\)</i></b>. Change from direct<br>
 to indirect discourse just the opposite of that in verse <!-#-->22.<br>
 <B>{Beasts}</B> <b><i>(\kt&#275;n&#275;\)</i></b>. For riding as here or for baggage. See on &#175;Lu<br>
 10:34. Asses or horses, but not war-horses. Since Paul was<br>
 chained to a soldier, another animal would be required for<br>
 baggage. It was also seventy miles and a change of horses might<br>
 be needed. The extreme precaution of Lysias is explained in some<br>
 Latin MSS. as due to fear of a night attack with the result that<br>
 he might be accused to Felix of bribery. Luke also probably<br>
 accompanied Paul. <B>{To bring safe}</B> <b><i>(\hina dias&#333;s&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Final<br>
 clause with \hina\ and the first aorist active subjunctive of<br>
 \dias&#333;z&#333;\, old verb, to save through <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> to a finish. Eight<br>
 times in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 14:36; Lu 7:3; Ac 23:24; 27:43,44; 28:1,4;<br>
 1Pe 3:20)</i></b>. <B>{Unto Felix the governor}</B> <b><i>(\pros Ph&#275;lika ton<br>
 h&#275;gemona\)</i></b>. Felix was a brother of Pallas, the notorious<br>
 favourite of Claudius. Both had been slaves and were now<br>
 freedmen. Felix was made procurator of Judea by Claudius A.D. 52.<br>
 He held the position till Festus succeeded him after complaints<br>
 by the Jews to Nero. He married Drusilla the daughter of Herod<br>
 Agrippa I with the hope of winning the favour of the Jews. He was<br>
 one of the most depraved men of his time. Tacitus says of him<br>
 that "with all cruelty and lust he exercised the power of a king<br>
 with the spirit of a slave." The term "governor" <b><i>(\h&#275;gem&#333;n\)</i></b><br>
 means "leader" from \h&#275;geomai\, to lead, and was applied to<br>
 leaders of all sorts <b><i>(emperors, kings, procurators)</i></b>. In the N.T.<br>
 it is used of Pilate <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:2)</i></b>, of Felix, <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 23:24,26,33;<br>
 24:1)</i></b>, of Festus <b><i>(<!-#-->26:30)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 23:25 <B>{And he wrote}</B> <b><i>(\grapsas\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle<br>
 of \graph&#333;\, agreeing with the subject <b><i>(Lysias)</i></b> of \eipen\ <b><i>(said)</i></b><br>
 back in verse <!-#-->23 <b><i>(beginning)</i></b>. <B>{After this form}</B> <b><i>(\echousan ton<br>
 tupon touton\)</i></b>. Textus Receptus has \periechousan\. The use of<br>
 \tupon\ <b><i>(type or form)</i></b> like _exemplum_ in Latin <b><i>(Page who quotes<br>
 Cicero _Ad Att_. IX. 6. 3)</i></b> may give merely the purport or<br>
 substantial contents of the letter. But there is no reason for<br>
 thinking that it is not a genuine copy since the letter may have<br>
 been read in open court before Felix, and Luke was probably with<br>
 Paul. The Roman law required that a subordinate officer like<br>
 Lysias in reporting a case to his superior should send a written<br>
 statement of the case and it was termed _elogium_. A copy of the<br>
 letter may have been given Paul after his appeal to Caesar. It<br>
 was probably written in Latin. The letter is a "dexterous mixture<br>
 of truth and falsehood" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b> with the stamp of genuineness.<br>
 It puts things in a favourable light for Lysias and makes no<br>
 mention of his order to scourge Paul.<br>
 <br>
 23:26 <B>{Most excellent}</B> <b><i>(\kratist&#333;i\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Lu 1:3 to<br>
 Theophilus though not in <!-#-->Ac 1:1. It is usual in addressing men<br>
 of rank as here, like our "Your Excellency" in <!-#-->24:3 and Paul<br>
 uses it to Festus in <!-#-->26:25. <B>{Greeting}</B> <b><i>(\chairein\)</i></b>. Absolute<br>
 infinitive with independent or absolute nominative <b><i>(\Klaudios<br>
 Lusias\)</i></b> as is used in letters <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:23; Jas 1:1)</i></b> and in<br>
 countless papyri <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1092)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 23:27 <B>{Was seized}</B> <b><i>(\sull&#275;mphthenta\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 participle of \sullamban&#333;\. <B>{Rescued him having learned that he<br>
 was a Roman}</B> <b><i>(\exeilamen math&#333;n hoti Romaios estin\)</i></b>. Wendt,<br>
 Zoeckler, and Furneaux try to defend this record of two facts by<br>
 Lysias in the wrong order from being an actual lie as Bengel<br>
 rightly says. Lysias did rescue Paul and he did learn that he was<br>
 a Roman, but in this order. He did not first learn that he was a<br>
 Roman and then rescue him as his letter states. The use of the<br>
 aorist participle <b><i>(\math&#333;n\ from \manthan&#333;\)</i></b> after the principal<br>
 verb \exeilamen\ <b><i>(second aorist middle of \exaire&#333;\, to take out<br>
 to oneself, to rescue)</i></b> can be either simultaneous action or<br>
 antecedent. There is in Greek no such idiom as the aorist<br>
 participle of subsequent action <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp.<br>
 1112-14)</i></b>. Lysias simply reversed the order of the facts and<br>
 omitted the order for scourging Paul to put himself in proper<br>
 light with Felix his superior officer and actually poses as the<br>
 protector of a fellow Roman citizen.<br>
 <br>
 23:28 <B>{To know}</B> <b><i>(\epign&#333;nai\)</i></b>. To know fully, \epi\, second<br>
 aorist active infinitive. <B>{They accused him}</B> <b><i>(\enekaloun aut&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active indicative, were accusing him <b><i>(dative)</i></b>,<br>
 repeating their charges.<br>
 <br>
 23:29 <B>{Concerning questions of their law}</B> <b><i>(\peri z&#275;t&#275;mata tou<br>
 nomou aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. The very distinction drawn by Gallio in Corinth<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:14f.)</i></b>. On the word see on <!-#-->15:2. <B>{But to have nothing<br>
 laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;den de axion<br>
 thanatou &#275; desm&#333;n echonta enkl&#275;ma\)</i></b>. Literally, "having no<br>
 accusation <b><i>(or crime)</i></b> worthy of death or of bonds." This phrase<br>
 here only in the N.T. \Egkl&#275;ma\ is old word for accusation or<br>
 crime from \egkale&#333;\ used in verse <!-#-->28 and in the N.T. only here<br>
 and <!-#-->25:16. Lysias thus expresses the opinion that Paul ought to<br>
 be set free and the lenient treatment that Paul received in<br>
 Caesarea and Rome <b><i>(first imprisonment)</i></b> is probably due to this<br>
 report of Lysias. Every Roman magistrate before whom Paul appears<br>
 declares him innocent <b><i>(Gallio, Lysias, Felix, Festus)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 23:30 <B>{When it was shown to me that there would be a plot}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275;nutheis&#275;s moi epiboul&#275;s esesthai\)</i></b>. Two constructions<br>
 combined; genitive absolute <b><i>(\m&#275;nutheis&#275;s epiboul&#275;s\, first<br>
 aorist passive participle of \m&#275;nu&#333;\)</i></b> and future infinitive<br>
 <b><i>(\esesthai\ as if \epiboul&#275;n\ accusative of general reference<br>
 used)</i></b> in indirect assertion after \m&#275;nu&#333;\ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_,<br>
 p. 877)</i></b>. <B>{Charging his accusers also}</B> <b><i>(\paraggeilas kai tois<br>
 kat&#275;gorois\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle of \paraggell&#333;\ with<br>
 which compare \math&#333;n\ above <b><i>(verse <!-#-->27)</i></b>, not subsequent action.<br>
 Dative case in \kat&#275;gorois\. <B>{Before thee}</B> <b><i>(\epi sou\)</i></b>. Common<br>
 idiom for "in the presence of" when before a judge <b><i>(like Latin<br>
 _apud_)</i></b> as in <!-#-->24:20,21; 25:26; 26:2. What happened to the forty<br>
 conspirators we have no way of knowing. Neither they nor the Jews<br>
 from Asia are heard of more during the long five years of Paul's<br>
 imprisonment in Caesarea and Rome.<br>
 <br>
 23:31 <B>{As it was commanded them}</B> <b><i>(\kata to diatetagmenon<br>
 autois\)</i></b>. "According to that which was commanded them," perfect<br>
 passive articular participle of \diatass&#333;\. <B>{By night}</B> <b><i>(\dia<br>
 nuktos\)</i></b>. Through the night, travelling by night forty miles from<br>
 Jerusalem to Antipatris which was founded by Herod the Great and<br>
 was on the road from Jerusalem to Caesarea, a hard night's ride.<br>
 <br>
 23:33 <B>{And they}</B> <b><i>(\hoitines\)</i></b>. Which very ones, the cavalry, the<br>
 horsemen of verse <!-#-->31. <B>{Delivered}</B> <b><i>(\anadontes\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active participle of \anadid&#333;mi\, old verb to give up, to hand<br>
 over, here only in the N.T. <B>{Presented Paul also}</B> <b><i>(\parest&#275;san<br>
 kai ton Paulon\)</i></b>. First aorist active <b><i>(transitive, not second<br>
 aorist intransitive)</i></b> indicative of \parist&#275;mi\, common verb to<br>
 present or place beside. What would Paul's friends in Caesarea<br>
 <b><i>(Philip and his daughters)</i></b> think of the prophecy of Agabus now so<br>
 quickly come true.<br>
 <br>
 23:34 <B>{When he had read it}</B> <b><i>(\anagnous\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \anagin&#333;sk&#333;\, to know again, to read. <B>{Of what<br>
 province he was}</B> <b><i>(\ek poias eparcheias estin\)</i></b>. Tense of \estin\<br>
 <b><i>(is)</i></b> retained in indirect question. \Poias\ is strictly "of what<br>
 kind of" province, whether senatorial or imperial. Cilicia, like<br>
 Judea, was under the control of the propraetor of Syria <b><i>(imperial<br>
 province)</i></b>. Paul's arrest was in Jerusalem and so under the<br>
 jurisdiction of Felix unless it was a matter of insurrection when<br>
 he could appeal to the propraetor of Syria.<br>
 <br>
 23:35 <B>{I will hear thy cause}</B> <b><i>(\diakousomai\)</i></b>. "I will hear thee<br>
 fully" <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b>. <B>{When--are come}</B> <b><i>(\paragen&#333;ntai\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 middle subjunctive of \paraginomai\ with temporal conjunction<br>
 \hotan\, indefinite temporal clause of future time <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 972)</i></b>, "whenever thine accusers come." <B>{In Herod's<br>
 palace}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i prait&#333;ri&#333;i\)</i></b>. The Latin word \praetorium\. The<br>
 word meant the camp of the general, then the palace of the<br>
 governor as here and <!-#-->Mt 27:27 which see, and then the camp of<br>
 praetorian soldiers or rather the praetorian guard as in <!-#-->Php<br>
 1:13.<br>
