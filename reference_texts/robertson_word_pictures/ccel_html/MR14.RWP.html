<p>14:1 <B>{After two days}</B> <b><i>(\meta duo h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. This was Tuesday<br>
 evening as we count time <b><i>(beginning of the Jewish Wednesday)</i></b>. In<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 26:2 Jesus is reported as naming this same date which would<br>
 put it our Thursday evening, beginning of the Jewish Friday. The<br>
 Gospel of John mentions five items that superficially considered<br>
 seem to contradict this definite date in Mark and Matthew, but<br>
 which are really in harmony with them. See discussion on <!-#-->Mt<br>
 26:17 and my <B>{Harmony of the Gospels}</B>, pp. 279 to 284. Mark<br>
 calls it here the feast of "the passover and the unleavened<br>
 bread," both names covering the eight days. Sometimes "passover"<br>
 is applied to only the first day, sometimes to the whole period.<br>
 No sharp distinction in usage was observed. <B>{Sought}</B> <b><i>(\ez&#275;toun\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect tense. They were still at it, though prevented so far.<br>
 <br>
 14:2 <B>{Not during the feast}</B> <b><i>(\M&#275; en t&#275;i heort&#275;i\)</i></b>. They had first<br>
 planned to kill him at the feast <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 11:57)</i></b>, but the Triumphal<br>
 Entry and great Tuesday debate <b><i>(this very morning)</i></b> in the temple<br>
 had made them decide to wait till after the feast was over. It<br>
 was plain that Jesus had too large and powerful a following. See<br>
 on &#175;Mt 26:47.<br>
 <br>
 14:3 <B>{As he sat at meat}</B> <b><i>(\katakeimenou autou\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 26:7 uses<br>
 \anakeimenou\, both words meaning reclining <b><i>(leaning down or up<br>
 or back)</i></b> and in the genitive absolute. See on &#175;Mt 26:6 in proof<br>
 that this is a different incident from that recorded in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 7:36-50. See on &#175;Mt 26:6-13 for discussion of details.<br>
 <B>{Spikenard}</B> <b><i>(\nardou pistik&#275;s\)</i></b>. This use of \pistikos\ with<br>
 \nardos\ occurs only here and in <!-#-->Joh 12:3. The adjective is<br>
 common enough in the older Greek and appears in the papyri also<br>
 in the sense of genuine, unadulterated, and that is probably the<br>
 idea here. The word spikenard is from the Vulgate _nardi<br>
 spicati_, probably from the Old Latin _nardi pistici_. <B>{Brake}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\suntripsousa\)</i></b>. Only in Mark. She probably broke the narrow<br>
 neck of the vase holding the ointment.<br>
 <br>
 14:5 <B>{Above three hundred pence}</B> <b><i>(\epan&#333; d&#275;nari&#333;n triakosi&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Matthew has "for much" while <!-#-->Joh 12:5 has "for three hundred<br>
 pence." The use of "far above" may be a detail from Peter's<br>
 memory of Judas' objection whose name in this connection is<br>
 preserved in <!-#-->Joh 12:4. <B>{And they murmured against her}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 enebrim&#333;nto aut&#275;i\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense of this striking word used<br>
 of the snorting of horses and seen already in <!-#-->Mr 1:43; 11:38.<br>
 It occurs in the LXX in the sense of anger as here <b><i>(<!-#-->Da 11:30)</i></b>.<br>
 Judas made the complaint against Mary of Bethany, but all the<br>
 apostles joined in the chorus of criticism of the wasteful<br>
 extravagance.<br>
 <br>
 14:8 <B>{She hath done what she could}</B> <b><i>(\ho eschen epoi&#275;sen\)</i></b>. This<br>
 alone in Mark. Two aorists. Literally, "what she had she did."<br>
 Mary could not comprehend the Lord's death, but she at least<br>
 showed her sympathy with him and some understanding of the coming<br>
 tragedy, a thing that not one of her critics had done. <B>{She hath<br>
 anointed my body aforehand for the burying}</B> <b><i>(\proelaben murisai<br>
 to s&#333;ma mou eis ton entaphiasmon\)</i></b>. Literally, "she took<br>
 beforehand to anoint my body for the burial." She anticipated the<br>
 event. This is Christ's justification of her noble deed. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 26:12 also speaks of the burial preparation by Mary, using the<br>
 verb \entaphiasai\.<br>
 <br>
 14:9 <B>{For a memorial of her}</B> <b><i>(\eis mn&#275;mosunon aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. So in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 26:13. There are many mausoleums that crumble to decay. But this<br>
 monument to Jesus fills the whole world still with its fragrance.<br>
 What a hint there is here for those who wish to leave permanent<br>
 memorials.<br>
 <br>
 14:10 <B>{He that was one of the twelve}</B> <b><i>(\ho heis t&#333;n d&#333;deka\)</i></b>.<br>
 Note the article here, "the one of the twelve," Matthew has only<br>
 \heis\, "one." Some have held that Mark here calls Judas the<br>
 primate among the twelve. Rather he means to call attention to<br>
 the idea that he was the one of the twelve who did this deed.<br>
 <br>
 14:11 <B>{And they, when they heard it, were glad}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de<br>
 akousantes echar&#275;san\)</i></b>. No doubt the rabbis looked on the<br>
 treachery of Judas as a veritable dispensation of Providence<br>
 amply justifying their plots against Jesus. <B>{Conveniently}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eukair&#333;s\)</i></b>. This was the whole point of the offer of Judas. He<br>
 claimed that he knew enough of the habits of Jesus to enable them<br>
 to catch him "in the absence of the multitude" <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:6)</i></b><br>
 without waiting for the passover to be over, when the crowds<br>
 would leave. For discussion of the motives of Judas, see on &#175;Mt<br>
 26:15. Mark merely notes the promise of "money" while Matthew<br>
 mentions "thirty pieces of silver" <b><i>(<!-#-->Zec 11:12)</i></b>, the price of a<br>
 slave.<br>
 <br>
 14:12 <B>{When they sacrificed the passover}</B> <b><i>(\hote to pascha<br>
 ethuon\)</i></b>. Imperfect indicative, customary practice. The paschal<br>
 lamb <b><i>(note \pascha\)</i></b> was slain at 6 P.M., beginning of the<br>
 fifteenth of the month <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 12:6)</i></b>, but the preparations were<br>
 made beforehand on the fourteenth <b><i>(Thursday)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 26:17<br>
 for discussion of "eat the passover."<br>
 <br>
 14:13 <B>{Two of his disciples}</B> <b><i>(\duo t&#333;n math&#275;t&#333;n autou\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu<br>
 22:8 names them, Peter and John. <B>{Bearing a pitcher of water}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\keramion hudatos bastaz&#333;n\)</i></b>. This item also in Luke, but not in<br>
 Matthew.<br>
 <br>
 14:14 <B>{The goodman of the house}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i oikodespot&#275;i\)</i></b>. A<br>
 non-classical word, but in late papyri. It means master<br>
 <b><i>(\despot\)</i></b> of the house, householder. The usual Greek has two<br>
 separate words, \oikou despot&#275;s\ <b><i>(master of the house)</i></b>. <B>{My<br>
 guest-chamber}</B> <b><i>(\to kataluma mou\)</i></b>. In LXX, papyri, and modern<br>
 Greek for lodging-place <b><i>(inn, as in <!-#-->Lu 2:7 or guest-chamber as<br>
 here)</i></b>. It was used for \khan\ or \caravanserai\. <B>{I shall eat}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\phag&#333;\)</i></b>. Futuristic aorist subjunctive with \hopou\.<br>
 <br>
 14:15 <B>{And he}</B> <b><i>(\kai autos\)</i></b>. Emphatic, and he himself. <B>{A large<br>
 upper room}</B> <b><i>(\anagaion mega\)</i></b>. Anything above ground <b><i>(\g&#275;\)</i></b>, and<br>
 particularly upstairs as here. Here and in <!-#-->Lu 22:12. Example in<br>
 Xenophon. Jesus wishes to observe this last feast with his<br>
 disciples alone, not with others as was often done. Evidently<br>
 this friend of Jesus was a man who would understand. <B>{Furnished}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\estr&#333;menon\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of \str&#333;nnumi\, state<br>
 of readiness. "Strewed with carpets, and with couches properly<br>
 spread" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:17 <B>{He cometh}</B> <b><i>(\erchetai\)</i></b>. Dramatic historical present. It<br>
 is assumed here that Jesus is observing the passover meal at the<br>
 regular time and hour, at 6 P.M. at the beginning of the<br>
 fifteenth <b><i>(evening of our Thursday, beginning of Jewish Friday)</i></b>.<br>
 Mark and Matthew note the time as evening and state it as the<br>
 regular passover meal.<br>
 <br>
 14:18 <B>{As they sat}</B> <b><i>(\anakeimen&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Reclined, of course.<br>
 It is a pity that these verbs are not translated properly in<br>
 English. Even Leonardo da Vinci in his immortal painting of the<br>
 Last Supper has Jesus and his apostles sitting, not reclining.<br>
 Probably he took an artist's license for effect. <B>{Even he that<br>
 eateth with me}</B> <b><i>(\ho esthi&#333;n met' emou\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ps 4:9. To this<br>
 day the Arabs will not violate hospitality by mistreating one who<br>
 breaks bread with them in the tent.<br>
 <br>
 14:20 <B>{One of the twelve}</B> <b><i>(\heis t&#333;n d&#333;deka\)</i></b>. It is as bad as<br>
 that. The sign that Jesus gave, <B>{the one dipping in the dish with<br>
 me}</B> <b><i>(\ho embaptomenos met' emou eis to trublion\)</i></b>, escaped the<br>
 notice of all. Jesus gave the sop to Judas who understood<br>
 perfectly that Jesus knew his purpose. See on &#175;Mt 26:21-24 for<br>
 further details.<br>
 <br>
 14:23 <B>{A cup}</B> <b><i>(\pot&#275;rion\)</i></b>. Probably the ordinary wine of the<br>
 country mixed with two-thirds water, though the word for wine<br>
 <b><i>(\oinos\)</i></b> is not used here in the Gospels, but "the fruit of the<br>
 vine" <b><i>(\ek tou gen&#275;matos t&#275;s ampelou\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mt 26:26-29 for<br>
 discussion of important details. Mark and Matthew give<br>
 substantially the same account of the institution of the Supper<br>
 by Jesus, while <!-#-->Lu 22:17-20 agrees closely with <!-#-->1Co 11:23-26<br>
 where Paul claims to have obtained his account by direct<br>
 revelation from the Lord Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 14:26 <B>{Sung a hymn}</B> <b><i>(\humn&#275;santes\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mt 26:30 for<br>
 discussion.<br>
 <br>
 14:29 <B>{Yet will not I}</B> <b><i>(\all' ouk eg&#333;\)</i></b>. Mark records here<br>
 Peter's boast of loyalty even though all desert him. All the<br>
 Gospels tell it. See discussion on &#175;Mt 26:33.<br>
 <br>
 14:30 <B>{Twice}</B> <b><i>(\dis\)</i></b>. This detail only in Mark. One crowing is<br>
 always the signal for more. The Fayum papyrus agrees with Mark in<br>
 having \dis\. The cock-crowing marks the third watch of the night<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 13:35)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:31 <B>{Exceeding vehemently}</B> <b><i>(\ekperiss&#333;s\)</i></b>. This strong<br>
 compounded adverb only in Mark and probably preserves Peter's own<br>
 statement of the remark. About the boast of Peter see on &#175;Mt<br>
 26:35.<br>
 <br>
 14:32 <B>{Which was named}</B> <b><i>(\hou to onoma\)</i></b>. Literally, "whose name<br>
 was." On Gethsemane see on &#175;Mt 26:36. <B>{While I pray}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s<br>
 proseux&#333;mai\)</i></b>. Aorist subjunctive with \he&#333;s\ really with purpose<br>
 involved, a common idiom. Matthew adds "go yonder" <b><i>(\apelth&#333;n<br>
 ekei\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:33 <B>{Greatly amazed and sore troubled}</B> <b><i>(\ekthambeisthai kai<br>
 ad&#275;monein\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 26:37 has "sorrowful and sore troubled." See on<br>
 Matt. about \ad&#275;monein\. Mark alone uses \exthambeisthai\ <b><i>(here<br>
 and in <!-#-->9:15)</i></b>. There is a papyrus example given by Moulton and<br>
 Milligan's _Vocabulary_. The verb \thambe&#333;\ occurs in <!-#-->Mr 10:32<br>
 for the amazement of the disciples at the look of Jesus as he<br>
 went toward Jerusalem. Now Jesus himself feels amazement as he<br>
 directly faces the struggle in the Garden of Gethsemane. He wins<br>
 the victory over himself in Gethsemane and then he can endure the<br>
 loss, despising the shame. For the moment he is rather amazed and<br>
 homesick for heaven. "Long as He had foreseen the Passion, when<br>
 it came clearly into view its terror exceeded His anticipations"<br>
 <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. "He learned from what he suffered," <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 5:8)</i></b> and this<br>
 new experience enriched the human soul of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 14:35 <B>{Fell on the ground}</B> <b><i>(\epipten epi t&#275;s g&#275;s\)</i></b>. Descriptive<br>
 imperfect. See him falling. Matthew has the aorist \epesen\.<br>
 <B>{Prayed}</B> <b><i>(\pros&#275;ucheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect, prayed repeatedly or<br>
 inchoative, began to pray. Either makes good sense. <B>{The hour}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\h&#275; h&#333;ra\)</i></b>. Jesus had long looked forward to this "hour" and had<br>
 often mentioned it <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 7:30; 8:20; 12:23,27; 13:1)</i></b>. See again<br>
 in <!-#-->Mr 14:41. Now he dreads it, surely a human trait that all<br>
 can understand.<br>
 <br>
 14:36 <B>{Abba, Father}</B> <b><i>(\Abba ho pat&#275;r\)</i></b>. Both Aramaic and Greek<br>
 and the article with each. This is not a case of translation, but<br>
 the use of both terms as is <!-#-->Ga 4:6, a probable memory of Paul's<br>
 childhood prayers. About "the cup" see on &#175;Mt 26:39. It is not<br>
 possible to take the language of Jesus as fear that he might die<br>
 before he came to the Cross. He was heard <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 5:7f.)</i></b> and<br>
 helped to submit to the Father's will as he does instantly. <B>{Not<br>
 what I will}</B> <b><i>(\ou ti eg&#333; thel&#333;\)</i></b>. Matthew has "as" <b><i>(\h&#333;s\)</i></b>. We<br>
 see the humanity of Jesus in its fulness both in the Temptations<br>
 and in Gethsemane, but without sin each time. And this was the<br>
 severest of all the temptations, to draw back from the Cross. The<br>
 victory over self brought surrender to the Father's will.<br>
 <br>
 14:37 <B>{Simon, sleepest thou?}</B> <b><i>(\Sim&#333;n, katheudeis;\)</i></b>. The old<br>
 name, not the new name, Peter. Already his boasted loyalty was<br>
 failing in the hour of crisis. Jesus fully knows the weakness of<br>
 human flesh <b><i>(see on &#175;Mt 26:41)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:40 <B>{Very heavy}</B> <b><i>(\katabarunomenoi\)</i></b>. Perfective use of \kata-\<br>
 with the participle. Matthew has the simple verb. Mark's word is<br>
 only here in the N.T. and is rare in Greek writers. Mark has the<br>
 vivid present passive participle, while Matthew has the perfect<br>
 passive \bebar&#275;menoi\. <B>{And they wist not what to answer him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai ouk &#275;ideisan ti apokrith&#333;sin aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Deliberative<br>
 subjunctive retained in the indirect question. Alone in Mark and<br>
 reminds one of the like embarrassment of these same three<br>
 disciples on the Mount of Transfiguration <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 9:6)</i></b>. On both<br>
 occasions weakness of the flesh prevented their real sympathy<br>
 with Jesus in his highest and deepest experiences. "Both their<br>
 shame and their drowsiness would make them dumb" <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:41 <B>{It is enough}</B> <b><i>(\apechei\)</i></b>. Alone in Mark. This impersonal<br>
 use is rare and has puzzled expositors no little. The papyri<br>
 <b><i>(Deissmann's _Light from the Ancient East_ and Moulton and<br>
 Milligan's _Vocabulary_)</i></b> furnish many examples of it as a receipt<br>
 for payment in full. See also <!-#-->Mt 6:2ff.; Lu 6:24; Php 4:18 for<br>
 the notion of paying in full. It is used here by Jesus in an<br>
 ironical sense, probably meaning that there was no need of<br>
 further reproof of the disciples for their failure to watch with<br>
 him. "This is no time for a lengthened exposure of the faults of<br>
 friends; the enemy is at the gate" <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. See further on &#175;Mt<br>
 26:45 for the approach of Judas.<br>
 <br>
 14:43 <B>{And the scribes}</B> <b><i>(\kai t&#333;n grammate&#333;n\)</i></b>. Mark adds this<br>
 item while <!-#-->Joh 18:3 mentions "Pharisees." It was evidently a<br>
 committee of the Sanhedrin for Judas had made his bargain with<br>
 the Sanhedrin <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:1; Mt 26:3; Lu 22:2)</i></b>. See discussion of<br>
 the betrayal and arrest on &#175;Mt 26:47-56 for details.<br>
 <br>
 14:44 <B>{Token}</B> <b><i>(\suss&#275;mon\)</i></b>. A common word in the ancient Greek<br>
 for a concerted signal according to agreement. It is here only in<br>
 the New Testament. <!-#-->Mt 26:48 has \s&#275;meion\, sign. The signal was<br>
 the kiss by Judas, a contemptible desecration of a friendly<br>
 salutation. <B>{And lead him away safely}</B> <b><i>(\kai apagete asphal&#333;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Only in Mark. Judas wished no slip to occur. Mark and Matthew do<br>
 not tell of the falling back upon the ground when Jesus<br>
 challenged the crowd with Judas. It is given by John alone <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 18:4-9)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:47 <B>{A certain one}</B> <b><i>(\heis tis\)</i></b>. Mark does not tell that it<br>
 was Peter. Only <!-#-->Joh 18:10 does that after Peter's death. He<br>
 really tried to kill the man, Malchus by name, as John again<br>
 tells <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:10)</i></b>. Mark does not give the rebuke to Peter by<br>
 Jesus in <!-#-->Mt 26:52ff.<br>
 <br>
 14:48 <B>{Against a robber}</B> <b><i>(\epi l&#275;ist&#275;n\)</i></b>. Highway robbers like<br>
 Barabbas were common and were often regarded as heroes. Jesus<br>
 will be crucified between two robbers in the very place that<br>
 Barabbas would have occupied.<br>
 <br>
 14:51 <B>{A certain young man}</B> <b><i>(\neaniskos tis\)</i></b>. This incident<br>
 alone in Mark. It is usually supposed that Mark himself, son of<br>
 Mary <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 12:12)</i></b> in whose house they probably had observed the<br>
 passover meal, had followed Jesus and the apostles to the Garden.<br>
 It is a lifelike touch quite in keeping with such a situation.<br>
 Here after the arrest he was following with Jesus <b><i>(\sun&#275;kolouthei<br>
 aut&#333;i\, imperfect tense)</i></b>. Note the vivid dramatic present<br>
 \kratousin\ <b><i>(they seize him)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:52 <B>{Linen cloth}</B> <b><i>(\sindona\)</i></b>. An old Greek word of unknown<br>
 origin. It was fine linen cloth used often for wrapping the dead<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:59; Mr 15:46; Lu 23:53)</i></b>. In this instance it could have<br>
 been a fine sheet or even a shirt.<br>
 <br>
 14:54 <B>{Peter had followed him afar off}</B> <b><i>(\Ho Petros apo makrothen<br>
 &#275;kolouth&#275;sen aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Here Mark uses the constative aorist<br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;kolouth&#275;sen\)</i></b> where <!-#-->Mt 26:58, and <!-#-->Lu 22:54 have the<br>
 picturesque imperfect <b><i>(\&#275;kolouthei\)</i></b>, was following. Possibly<br>
 Mark did not care to dwell on the picture of Peter furtively<br>
 following at a distance, not bold enough to take an open stand<br>
 with Christ as the Beloved Disciple did, and yet unable to remain<br>
 away with the other disciples. <B>{Was sitting with}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n<br>
 sunkath&#275;menos\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect middle, picturing Peter<br>
 making himself at home with the officers <b><i>(\hup&#275;ret&#333;n\)</i></b>, under<br>
 rowers, literally, then servants of any kind. <!-#-->Joh 18:25<br>
 describes Peter as standing <b><i>(\hest&#333;s\)</i></b>. Probably he did now one,<br>
 now the other, in his restless weary mood. <B>{Warming himself in<br>
 the light}</B> <b><i>(\thermainomenos pr&#333;s to ph&#333;s\)</i></b>. Direct middle. Fire<br>
 has light as well as heat and it shone in Peter's face. He was<br>
 not hidden as much as he supposed he was.<br>
 <br>
 14:56 <B>{Their witness agreed not together}</B> <b><i>(\isai hai marturiai<br>
 ouk &#275;san\)</i></b>. Literally, the testimonies were not equal. They did<br>
 not correspond with each other on essential points. <B>{Many were<br>
 bearing false witness}</B> <b><i>(\epseudomarturoun\, imperfect, repeated<br>
 action)</i></b> <B>{against him}</B>. No two witnesses bore joint testimony to<br>
 justify a capital sentence according to the law <b><i>(<!-#-->De 19:15)</i></b>.<br>
 Note imperfects in these verses <b><i>(<!-#-->55-57)</i></b> to indicate repeated<br>
 failures.<br>
 <br>
 14:57 <B>{Bare false witness}</B> <b><i>(\epseudomarturoun\)</i></b>. In desperation<br>
 some attempted once more <b><i>(conative imperfect)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:58 <B>{Made with hands}</B> <b><i>(\cheiropoi&#275;ton\)</i></b>. In Mark alone. An old<br>
 Greek word. The negative form \acheiropoi&#275;ton\ here occurs<br>
 elsewhere only in <!-#-->2Co 5:1; Col 2:11. In <!-#-->Heb 9:11 the negative<br>
 \ou\ is used with the positive form. It is possible that a real<br>
 \logion\ of Jesus underlies the perversion of it here. Mark and<br>
 Matthew do not quote the witnesses precisely alike. Perhaps they<br>
 quoted Jesus differently and therein is shown part of the<br>
 disagreement, for Mark adds verse <!-#-->59 <b><i>(not in Matthew)</i></b>. "And not<br>
 even so did their witness agree together," repeating the point of<br>
 verse <!-#-->57. Swete observes that Jesus, as a matter of fact, did<br>
 do what he is quoted as saying in Mark: "He said what the event<br>
 has proved to be true; His death destroyed the old order, and His<br>
 resurrection created the new." But these witnesses did not mean<br>
 that by what they said. The only saying of Jesus at all like this<br>
 preserved to us is that in <!-#-->Joh 2:19, when he referred not to<br>
 the temple in Jerusalem, but to the temple of his body, though no<br>
 one understood it at the time.<br>
 <br>
 14:60 <B>{Stood up in the midst}</B> <b><i>(\anastas eis meson\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active participle. For greater solemnity he arose to make<br>
 up by bluster the lack of evidence. The high priest stepped out<br>
 into the midst as if to attack Jesus by vehement questions. See<br>
 on &#175;Mt 26:59-68 for details here.<br>
 <br>
 14:61 <B>{And answered nothing}</B> <b><i>(\kai ouk apekrinato ouden\)</i></b>. Mark<br>
 adds the negative statement to the positive "kept silent"<br>
 <b><i>(\esi&#333;p&#257;\)</i></b>, imperfect, also in Matthew. Mark does not give the<br>
 solemn oath in Matthew under which Jesus had to answer. See on<br>
 Matthew.<br>
 <br>
 14:62 <B>{I am}</B> <b><i>(\ego eimi\)</i></b>. Matthew has it, "Thou hast said,"<br>
 which is the equivalent of the affirmative. But Mark's statement<br>
 is definite beyond controversy. See on &#175;Mt 26:64-68 for the<br>
 claims of Jesus and the conduct of Caiaphas.<br>
 <br>
 14:64 <B>{They all}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de pantes\)</i></b>. This would mean that Joseph<br>
 of Arimathea was not present since he did not consent to the<br>
 death of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:51)</i></b>. Nicodemus was apparently absent<br>
 also, probably not invited because of previous sympathy with<br>
 Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 7:50)</i></b>. But all who were present voted for the death<br>
 of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 14:65 <B>{Cover his face}</B> <b><i>(\perikaluptein autou to pros&#333;pon\)</i></b>. Put a<br>
 veil around his face. Not in Matthew, but in <!-#-->Lu 22:64 where<br>
 Revised Version translates \perikalupsantes\ by "blind-folded."<br>
 All three Gospels give the jeering demand of the Sanhedrin:<br>
 "Prophesy" <b><i>(\proph&#275;teuson\)</i></b>, meaning, as Matthew and Luke add,<br>
 thereby telling who struck him while he was blindfolded. Mark<br>
 adds "the officers" <b><i>(same as in verse <!-#-->54)</i></b> of the Sanhedrin,<br>
 Roman lictors or sergeants-at-arms who had arrested Jesus in<br>
 Gethsemane and who still held Jesus <b><i>(\hoi sunechontes auton\, <!-#-->Lu<br>
 22:63)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 26:67 alludes to their treatment of Jesus without<br>
 clearly indicating who they were. <B>{With blows of their hands}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\rapismasin\)</i></b>. The verb \rapiz&#333;\ in <!-#-->Mt 26:67 originally meant<br>
 to smite with a rod. In late writers it comes to mean to slap the<br>
 face with the palm of the hands. The same thing is true of the<br>
 substantive \rapisma\ used here. A papyrus of the sixth century<br>
 A.D. uses it in the sense of a scar on the face as the result of<br>
 a blow. It is in the instrumental case here. "They caught him<br>
 with blows," Swete suggests for the unusual \elabon\ in this<br>
 sense. "With rods" is, of course, possible as the lictors carried<br>
 rods. At any rate it was a gross indignity.<br>
 <br>
 14:66 <B>{Beneath in the court}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#333; en t&#275;i aul&#275;i\)</i></b>. This implies<br>
 that Jesus was upstairs when the Sanhedrin met. <!-#-->Mt 22:69 has it<br>
 <B>{without in the court}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#333; en t&#275;i aul&#275;i\)</i></b>. Both are true. The<br>
 open court was outside of the rooms and also below.<br>
 <br>
 14:67 <B>{Warming himself}</B> <b><i>(\thermainomenon\)</i></b>. Mark mentions this<br>
 fact about Peter twice <b><i>(<!-#-->14:54,67)</i></b> as does John <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 18:18,25)</i></b>. He was twice beside the fire. It is quite difficult<br>
 to relate clearly the three denials as told in the Four Gospels.<br>
 Each time several may have joined in, both maids and men. <B>{The<br>
 Nazarene}</B> <b><i>(\tou Nazar&#275;nou\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Mt 26:69 it is "the Galilean."<br>
 A number were probably speaking, one saying one thing, another<br>
 another.<br>
 <br>
 14:68 <B>{I neither know nor understand}</B> <b><i>(\oute oida oute<br>
 epistamai\)</i></b>. This denial is fuller in Mark, briefest in John.<br>
 <B>{What thou sayest}</B> <b><i>(\su ti legeis\)</i></b>. Can be understood as a<br>
 direct question. Note position of <B>{thou}</B> <b><i>(\su\)</i></b>, proleptical.<br>
 <B>{Into the porch}</B> <b><i>(\eis to proaulion\)</i></b>. Only here in the New<br>
 Testament. Plato uses it of a prelude on a flute. It occurs also<br>
 in the plural for preparations the day before the wedding. Here<br>
 it means the vestibule to the court. <!-#-->Mt 26:71 has \pul&#333;na\, a<br>
 common word for gate or front porch. <B>{And the cock crew}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 alekt&#333;r eph&#333;n&#275;sen\)</i></b>. Omitted by Aleph B L Sinaitic Syriac. It is<br>
 genuine in verse <!-#-->72 where "the second time" <b><i>(\ek deuterou\)</i></b><br>
 occurs also. It is possible that because of verse <!-#-->72 it crept<br>
 into verse <!-#-->68. Mark alone alludes to the cock crowing twice,<br>
 originally <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:30)</i></b>, and twice in verse <!-#-->72, besides verse<br>
 <!-#-->68 which is hardly genuine.<br>
 <br>
 14:69 <B>{To them that stood by}</B> <b><i>(\tois parest&#333;sin\)</i></b>. This talk<br>
 about Peter was overheard by him. "This fellow <b><i>(\houtos\)</i></b> is one<br>
 of them." So in verse <!-#-->70 the talk is directly to Peter as in<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 26:73, but in <!-#-->Lu 22:59 it is about him. Soon the<br>
 bystanders <b><i>(\hoi parest&#333;tes\)</i></b> will join in the accusation to<br>
 Peter <b><i>(verse <!-#-->70; Mt 26:73)</i></b>, with the specially pungent question<br>
 in <!-#-->Joh 18:26 which was the climax. See on &#175;Mt 26:69-75 for<br>
 discussion of similar details.<br>
 <br>
 14:71 <B>{Curse}</B> <b><i>(\anathematizein\)</i></b>. Our word _anathema_ <b><i>(\ana,<br>
 thema\, an offering, then something devoted or a curse)</i></b>. Finally<br>
 the two meanings were distinguished by \anath&#275;ma\ for offering<br>
 and \anathema\ for curse. Deissmann has found examples at Megara<br>
 of \anathema\ in the sense of curse. Hence the distinction<br>
 observed in the N.T. was already in the _Koin&#275;_.  <!-#-->Mt 26:74 has<br>
 \katathematizein\, which is a \hapax legomenon\ in the N.T.,<br>
 though common in the LXX. This word has the notion of calling<br>
 down curses on one's self if the thing is not true.<br>
 <br>
 14:72 <B>{Called to mind}</B> <b><i>(\anemn&#275;sth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative. <!-#-->Mt 26:75 has the uncompounded verb \emn&#275;sth&#275;\ while<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 22:61 has another compound \hupemn&#275;sth&#275;\, was reminded.<br>
 <B>{When he thought thereon}</B> <b><i>(\epibal&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \epiball&#333;\. It is used absolutely here, though<br>
 there is a reference to \to rh&#275;ma\ above, the word of Jesus, and<br>
 the idiom involves \ton noun\ so that the meaning is to put the<br>
 mind upon something. In <!-#-->Lu 15:12 there is another absolute use<br>
 with a different sense. Moulton <b><i>(_Prolegomena_, p. 131)</i></b> quotes a<br>
 Ptolemaic papyrus Tb P 50 where \epibal&#333;n\ probably means "set<br>
 to," put his mind on. <B>{Wept}</B> <b><i>(\eklaien\)</i></b>. Inchoative imperfect,<br>
 began to weep. <!-#-->Mt 26:75 has the ingressive aorist \eklausen\,<br>
 burst into tears.<br>
