<p>3:1 <B>{Finally}</B> <b><i>(\to loipon\)</i></b>. Accusative of general reference. Cf.<br>
 \loipon\ <!-#-->1Th 4:1. <B>{Pray}</B> <b><i>(\proseuchesthe\)</i></b>. Present middle,<br>
 keep on praying. Note \peri\ as in <!-#-->1Th 5:25. <B>{That the word of<br>
 the Lord may run and be glorified}</B> <b><i>(\hina ho logos tou kuriou<br>
 trech&#275;i kai doxaz&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Usual construction of \hina\ after<br>
 \proseuchomai\, sub-final use, content and purpose combined. Note<br>
 present subjunctive with both verbs rather than aorist, may keep<br>
 on running and being glorified, two verbs joined together nowhere<br>
 else in the N.T. Paul probably derived this metaphor from the<br>
 stadium as in <!-#-->1Co 9:24ff.; Ga 2:2; Ro 9:16; Php 2:16; 2Ti 4:7.<br>
 Lightfoot translates "may have a triumphant career." On the word<br>
 of the Lord see on &#175;1Th 1:8. Paul recognizes the close relation<br>
 between himself and the readers. He needs their prayers and<br>
 sympathy and he rejoices in their reception of the word of the<br>
 Lord already, <B>{even as also it is with you}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s kai pros<br>
 humas\)</i></b>. "As it does in your case" <b><i>(Frame)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:2 <B>{And that we may be delivered}</B> <b><i>(\kai hina rusth&#333;men\)</i></b>. A<br>
 second and more personal petition <b><i>(Milligan)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive subjunctive of \ruomai\, old verb to rescue. Note change<br>
 in tense from present to aorist <b><i>(effective aorist)</i></b>. <B>{From<br>
 unreasonable and evil men}</B> <b><i>(\apo t&#333;n atop&#333;n kai pon&#275;r&#333;n<br>
 anthr&#333;p&#333;n\)</i></b>. Ablative case with \apo\. Originally in the old<br>
 Greek \atopos\ <b><i>(\a\ privative and \topos\)</i></b> is out of place, odd,<br>
 unbecoming, perverse, outrageous, both of things and persons.<br>
 \Pon&#275;ros\ is from \pone&#333;\, to work <b><i>(\ponos\)</i></b>, looking on labour<br>
 as an annoyance, bad, evil. Paul had a plague of such men in<br>
 Corinth as he had in Thessalonica. <B>{For all have not faith}</B> <b><i>(\ou<br>
 gar pant&#333;n h&#275; pistis\)</i></b>. Copula \estin\ not expressed. \Pant&#333;n\ is<br>
 predicate possessive genitive, faith <b><i>(article with abstract<br>
 substantive)</i></b> does not belong to all. Hence their evil conduct.<br>
 <br>
 3:3 <B>{But the Lord is faithful}</B> <b><i>(\pistos de estin ho kurios\)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{But faithful is the Lord}</B> <b><i>(correct rendition)</i></b>, with a play<br>
 <b><i>(paronomasia)</i></b> on \pistis\ by \pistos\ as in <!-#-->Ro 3:3 we have a<br>
 word-play on \apiste&#333;\ and \apistia\. The Lord can be counted on,<br>
 however perverse men may be. <B>{From the evil one}</B> <b><i>(\apo tou<br>
 pon&#275;rou\)</i></b>. Apparently a reminiscence of the Lord's Prayer in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 6:13 \rusai h&#275;mas apo tou pon&#275;rou\. But here as there it is not<br>
 certain whether \tou pon&#275;rou\ is neuter <b><i>(evil)</i></b> like to \pon&#275;ron\<br>
 in <!-#-->Ro 12:9 or masculine <b><i>(the evil one)</i></b>. But we have \ho<br>
 pon&#275;ros\ <b><i>(the evil one)</i></b> in <!-#-->1Jo 5:18 and \tou pon&#275;rou\ is<br>
 clearly masculine in <!-#-->Eph 6:16. If masculine here, as is<br>
 probable, is it "the Evil One" <b><i>(Ellicott)</i></b> or merely the evil man<br>
 like those mentioned in verse <!-#-->2? Perhaps Paul has in mind the<br>
 representative of Satan, the man of sin, pictured in <!-#-->2:1-12, by<br>
 the phrase here without trying to be too definite.<br>
 <br>
 3:4 <B>{And we have confidence}</B> <b><i>(\pepoithomen\)</i></b>. Second perfect<br>
 indicative of \peith&#333;\, to persuade, intransitive in this tense,<br>
 we are in a state of trust. <B>{In the Lord touching you}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 kuri&#333;i eph' humas\)</i></b>. Note the two prepositions, \en\ in the<br>
 sphere of the Lord <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 4:1)</i></b> as the _ground_ of Paul's<br>
 confident trust, \eph'\ <b><i>(\epi\)</i></b> with the accusative <b><i>(towards you)</i></b><br>
 where the dative could have been used <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->2Co 2:3)</i></b>. <B>{Ye both<br>
 do and will do}</B> <b><i>(\[kai] poieite kai poi&#275;sete\)</i></b>. Compliment and<br>
 also appeal, present and future tenses of \poie&#333;\. <B>{The things<br>
 which we command}</B> <b><i>(\ha paraggellomen\)</i></b>. Note of apostolic<br>
 authority here, not advice or urging, but command.<br>
 <br>
 3:5 <B>{Direct}</B> <b><i>(\kateuthunai\)</i></b>. First aorist active optative of<br>
 wish for the future as in <!-#-->2:17; 1Th 5:23 from \kateuthun&#333;\, old<br>
 verb, as in <!-#-->1Th 3:11 <b><i>(there <B>{way}</B>, here <B>{hearts}</B>)</i></b> and <!-#-->Lu 1:79<br>
 of <B>{feet}</B> <b><i>(\podas\)</i></b>. Perfective use of \kata\. Bold figure for<br>
 making smooth and direct road. The Lord here is the Lord Jesus.<br>
 <B>{Into the love of God}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n agap&#275;n tou theou\)</i></b>. Either<br>
 subjective or objective genitive makes sense and Lightfoot pleads<br>
 for both, "not only as an objective attribute of deity, but as a<br>
 ruling principle in our hearts," holding that it is "seldom<br>
 possible to separate the one from the other." Most scholars take<br>
 it here as subjective, the characteristic of God. <B>{Into the<br>
 patience of Christ}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n hupomn&#275;n tou Christou\)</i></b>. There is<br>
 the same ambiguity here, though the subjective idea, the patience<br>
 shown by Christ, is the one usually accepted rather than "the<br>
 patient waiting for Christ" <b><i>(objective genitive)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:6 <B>{Now we command you}</B> <b><i>(\paraggellomen de humin\)</i></b>. Paul puts<br>
 into practice the confidence expressed on their obedience to his<br>
 commands in verse <!-#-->4. <B>{In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\en onomati tou kuriou I&#275;sou Christou\)</i></b>. <B>{Name}</B> <b><i>(\onoma\)</i></b> here<br>
 for authority of Jesus Christ with which compare <B>{through the<br>
 Lord Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\dia tou kuriou I&#275;sou\)</i></b> in <!-#-->1Th 4:2. For a full<br>
 discussion of the phrase see the monograph of W. Heitmuller, _Im<br>
 Namen Jesu_. Paul wishes his readers to realize the<br>
 responsibility on them for their obedience to his command. <B>{That<br>
 ye withdraw yourselves}</B> <b><i>(\stellesthai humas\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 <b><i>(direct)</i></b> infinitive of \stell&#333;\, old verb to place, arrange, make<br>
 compact or shorten as sails, to move oneself from or to withdraw<br>
 oneself from <b><i>(with \apo\ and the ablative)</i></b>. In <!-#-->2Co 8:20 the<br>
 middle voice <b><i>(\stellomenoi\)</i></b> means taking care. <B>{From every<br>
 brother that walketh disorderly}</B> <b><i>(\apo pantos adelphou atakt&#333;s<br>
 peripatountos\)</i></b>. He calls him "brother" still. The adverb<br>
 \atakt&#333;s\ is common in Plato and is here and verse <!-#-->11 alone in<br>
 the N.T., though the adjective \ataktos\, equally common in Plato<br>
 we had in <!-#-->1Th 5:14 which see. Military term, out of ranks. <B>{And<br>
 not after the tradition}</B> <b><i>(\kai m&#275; kata t&#275;n paradosin\)</i></b>. See on<br>
 &#175;2:15 for \paradosin\. <B>{Which they received of us}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;n<br>
 parelabosan par h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. Westcott and Hort put this form of the<br>
 verb <b><i>(second aorist indicative third person plural of<br>
 \paralamban&#333;\, the \-osan\ form instead of \-on\, with slight<br>
 support from the papyri, but in the LXX and the Boeotian dialect,<br>
 Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 335f.)</i></b> in the margin with \parelabete\<br>
 <b><i>(ye received)</i></b> in the text. There are five different readings of<br>
 the verb here, the others being \parelabon, parelabe, elabosan\.<br>
 <br>
 3:7 <B>{How ye ought to imitate us}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;s dei mimeisthai h&#275;mas\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, how it is necessary to imitate us. The infinitive<br>
 \mimeisthai\ is the old verb \mimeomai\ from \mimos\ <b><i>(actor,<br>
 mimic)</i></b>, but in N.T. only here <b><i>(and verse <!-#-->9)</i></b>, <!-#-->Heb 13:7; 3Jo<br>
 1:11. It is a daring thing to say, but Paul knew that he had to<br>
 set the new Christians in the midst of Jews and Gentiles a model<br>
 for their imitation <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 3:17)</i></b>. <B>{For we behaved not ourselves<br>
 disorderly among you}</B> <b><i>(\hoti ouk &#275;takt&#275;samen en humin\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active indicative of old verb \atakte&#333;\, to be out of<br>
 ranks of soldiers. Specific denial on Paul's part in contrast to<br>
 verse <!-#-->6,17.<br>
 <br>
 3:8 <B>{For nought}</B> <b><i>(\d&#333;rean\)</i></b>. Adverbial accusative, as a gift,<br>
 gift-wise <b><i>(\d&#333;rea\, gift, from \did&#333;mi\)</i></b>. Same claim made to the<br>
 Corinthians <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:7)</i></b>, old word, in LXX, and papyri. He lodged<br>
 with Jason, but did not receive his meals _gratis_, for he paid<br>
 for them. Apparently he received no invitations to meals. Paul<br>
 had to make his financial independence clear to avoid false<br>
 charges which were made in spite of all his efforts. To eat bread<br>
 is merely a Hebraism for eat <b><i>(verse <!-#-->10)</i></b>. See <!-#-->1Th 2:9 for<br>
 labour and travail, and night and day <b><i>(\nuktos kai h&#275;meras\,<br>
 genitive of time, by night and by day)</i></b>. See <!-#-->1Th 2:9 for rest of<br>
 the verse in precisely the same words.<br>
 <br>
 3:9 <B>{Not because we have not the right}</B> <b><i>(\ouch hoti ouk echomen<br>
 exousian\)</i></b>. Paul is sensitive on his <B>{right}</B> to receive adequate<br>
 support <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 2:6; 1 Co 9:4 where he uses the same word<br>
 \exousian\ in the long defence of this <B>{right}</B>, <!-#-->1Co 9:1-27)</i></b>. So<br>
 he here puts in this limitation to avoid misapprehension. He did<br>
 allow churches to help him where he would not be misunderstood<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:7-11; Php 4:45f.)</i></b>. Paul uses \ouch hoti\ elsewhere to<br>
 avoid misunderstanding <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 1:24; 3:5; Php 4:17)</i></b>. <B>{But to make<br>
 ourselves an ensample unto you}</B> <b><i>(\all' hina heautous tupon d&#333;men<br>
 humin\)</i></b>. Literally, <B>{but that we might give ourselves a type to<br>
 you}</B>. Purpose with \hina\ and second aorist active subjunctive of<br>
 \did&#333;mi\. On \tupon\ see on &#175;1Th 1:7.<br>
 <br>
 3:10 <B>{This}</B> <b><i>(\touto\)</i></b>. What he proceeds to give. <B>{If any will not<br>
 work, neither let him eat}</B> <b><i>(\hoti ei tis ou thelei ergazesthai<br>
 m&#275;de esthiet&#333;\)</i></b>. Recitative \hoti\ here not to be translated,<br>
 like our modern quotation marks. Apparently a Jewish proverb<br>
 based on <!-#-->Ge 3:19. Wetstein quotes several parallels. Moffatt<br>
 gives this from Carlyle's _Chartism_: "He that will not work<br>
 according to his faculty, let him perish according to his<br>
 necessity." Deissmann <b><i>(_Light from the Ancient East_, p. 314)</i></b><br>
 sees Paul borrowing a piece of workshop morality. It was needed,<br>
 as is plain. This is a condition of the first class <b><i>(note<br>
 negative \ou\)</i></b> with the negative imperative in the conclusion.<br>
 <br>
 3:11 <B>{For we hear}</B> <b><i>(\akouomen gar\)</i></b>. Fresh news from Thessalonica<br>
 evidently. For the present tense compare <!-#-->1Co 11:18. The<br>
 accusative and the participle is a regular idiom for indirect<br>
 discourse with this verb <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 1040-2)</i></b>.<br>
 Three picturesque present participles, the first a general<br>
 description, \peripatountas atakt&#333;s\, the other two specifying<br>
 with a vivid word-play, <B>{that work not at all, but are<br>
 busy-bodies}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;den ergazomenous alla periergazomenous\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, <B>{doing nothing but doing around}</B>. Ellicott suggests,<br>
 <B>{doing no business but being busy bodies}</B>. "The first persecution<br>
 at Thessalonica had been fostered by a number of fanatical<br>
 loungers <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 17:5)</i></b>" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>. These theological dead-beats<br>
 were too pious to work, but perfectly willing to eat at the hands<br>
 of their neighbours while they piddled and frittered away the<br>
 time in idleness.<br>
 <br>
 3:12 <B>{We command and exhort}</B> <b><i>(\paraggellomen kai parakaloumen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul asserts his authority as an apostle and pleads as a man and<br>
 minister. <B>{That with quietness they work, and eat their own<br>
 bread}</B> <b><i>(\hina meta h&#275;suchias ergazomenoi ton heaut&#333;n arton<br>
 esthi&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Substance of the command and exhortation by \hina\<br>
 and the present subjunctive \esthi&#333;sin\. Literally, <B>{that working<br>
 with quietness they keep on eating their own bread}</B>. The precise<br>
 opposite of their conduct in verse <!-#-->11.<br>
 <br>
 3:13 <B>{But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing}</B> <b><i>(\humeis de,<br>
 adelphoi, m&#275; enkak&#275;s&#275;te kalopoiountes\)</i></b>. Emphatic position of<br>
 \humeis\ in contrast to these piddlers. \M&#275;\ and the aorist<br>
 subjunctive is a prohibition against beginning an act <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, pp. 851-4)</i></b>. It is a late verb and means to behave<br>
 badly in, to be cowardly, to lose courage, to flag, to faint,<br>
 <b><i>(\en, kakos\)</i></b> and outside of <!-#-->Lu 18:1 in the N.T. is only in<br>
 Paul's Epistles <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 3:13; 2Co 4:1,16; Ga 6:9; Eph 3:13)</i></b>. It<br>
 occurs in Polybius. The late verb \kalopoie&#333;\, to do the fair<br>
 <b><i>(\kalos\)</i></b> or honourable thing occurs nowhere else in the N.T.,<br>
 but is in the LXX and a late papyrus. Paul uses \to kalon poiein\<br>
 in <!-#-->2Co 13:7; Ga 6:9; Ro 7:21 with the same idea. He has<br>
 \agathopoie&#333;\, to do good, in <!-#-->1Ti 6:18.<br>
 <br>
 3:14 <B>{And if any one obeyeth not our word by this epistle}</B> <b><i>(\ei<br>
 de tis ouch hupakouei t&#333;i log&#333;i h&#275;m&#333;n dia t&#275;s epistol&#275;s\)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 sums up the issue bluntly with this ultimatum. Condition of the<br>
 first class, with negative \ou\, assuming it to be true. <B>{Note<br>
 that man}</B> <b><i>(\touton s&#275;meiousthe\)</i></b>. Late verb \s&#275;meio&#333;\, from<br>
 \s&#275;meion\, sign, mark, token. Put a tag on that man. Here only in<br>
 N.T. "The verb is regularly used for the signature to a receipt<br>
 or formal notice in the papyri and the ostraca of the Imperial<br>
 period" <b><i>(Moulton & Milligan's _Vocabulary_)</i></b>. How this is to be<br>
 done <b><i>(by letter or in public meeting)</i></b> Paul does not say. <B>{That ye<br>
 have no company with him}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; sunanamignusthai aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. The MSS.<br>
 are divided between the present middle infinitive as above in a<br>
 command like <!-#-->Ro 12:15; Php 3:16 or the present middle<br>
 imperative \sunanamignusthe\ <b><i>(\-ai\ and \-e\ often being<br>
 pronounced alike in the _Koin&#275;_)</i></b>. The infinitive can also be<br>
 explained as an indirect command. This double compound verb is<br>
 late, in LXX and Plutarch, in N.T. only here and <!-#-->1Co 5:9,11.<br>
 \Aut&#333;i\ is in associative instrumental case. <B>{To the end that he<br>
 may be ashamed}</B> <b><i>(\hina entrap&#275;i\)</i></b>. Purpose clause with \hina\.<br>
 Second aorist passive subjunctive of \entrep&#333;\, to turn on,<br>
 middle to turn on oneself or to put to shame, passive to be made<br>
 ashamed. The idea is to have one's thoughts turned in on oneself.<br>
 <br>
 3:15 <B>{Not as an enemy}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; h&#333;s echthron\)</i></b>. This is always the<br>
 problem in such ostracism as discipline, however necessary it is<br>
 at times. Few things in our churches are more difficult of wise<br>
 execution than the discipline of erring members. The word<br>
 \echthros\ is an adjective, hateful, from \echthos\, hate. It can<br>
 be passive, <B>{hated}</B>, as in <!-#-->Ro 11:28, but is usually active<br>
 <B>{hostile}</B>, enemy, foe.<br>
 <br>
 3:16 <B>{The Lord of peace himself}</B> <b><i>(\autos ho kurios t&#275;s eir&#275;n&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 See <!-#-->1Th 5:23 for <B>{the God of peace himself}</B>. <B>{Give you peace}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\doi&#275; humin t&#275;n eir&#275;n&#275;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active optative<br>
 <b><i>(_Koin&#275;_)</i></b> of \did&#333;mi\, not \d&#333;&#275;i\ <b><i>(subjunctive)</i></b>. So also <!-#-->Ro<br>
 15:5; 2Ti 1:16,18. The Lord Jesus whose characteristic is peace,<br>
 can alone give real peace to the heart and to the world. <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 14:27)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:17 <B>{Of me Paul with mine own hand}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i em&#275;i cheiri Paulou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Instrumental case \cheiri\. Note genitive \Paulou\ in apposition<br>
 with possessive idea in the possessive pronoun \em&#275;i\. Paul had<br>
 dictated the letter, but now wrote the salutation in his hand.<br>
 <B>{The token in every epistle}</B> <b><i>(\s&#275;meion en pas&#275;i epistol&#275;i\)</i></b>. Mark<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->14)</i></b> and proof of the genuineness of each epistle, Paul's<br>
 signature. Already there were spurious forgeries <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 2:2)</i></b>.<br>
 Thus each church was enabled to know that Paul wrote the letter.<br>
 If only the autograph copy could be found!<br>
 <br>
 3:18 Salutation just like that in <!-#-->1Th 5:28 with the addition of<br>
 \pant&#333;n\ <b><i>(all)</i></b>.<br>
