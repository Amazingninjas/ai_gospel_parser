<p>3:1 <B>{What advantage then hath the Jew?}</B> <b><i>(\ti oun to perisson tou<br>
 Ioudaiou?\)</i></b>. Literally, "What then is the overplus of the Jew?"<br>
 What does the Jew have over and above the Gentile? It is a<br>
 pertinent question after the stinging indictment of the Jew in<br>
 chapter 2. <B>{The profit}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; &#333;phelia\)</i></b>. The help. Old word, only<br>
 here in N.T. See <!-#-->Mr 8:36 for \&#333;phelei\, the verb to profit.<br>
 <br>
 3:2 <B>{Much every way}</B> <b><i>(\polu kata panta\)</i></b>. \Polu\ points back to<br>
 \to perisson\. So it means the overplus of the Jew is much from<br>
 every angle. <B>{First of all}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;ton men\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->1:8; 1Co<br>
 11:18 Paul does not add to his "first." He singles out one<br>
 privilege of the many possessed by the Jew. <B>{They were intrusted<br>
 with}</B> <b><i>(\episteuth&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of<br>
 \pisteu&#333;\, to intrust, with accusative of the thing and dative of<br>
 the person in the active. In the passive as here the accusative<br>
 of the thing is retained as in <!-#-->1Th 2:4. <B>{The oracles of God}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ta logia tou theou\)</i></b>. In the accusative case, therefore, the<br>
 object of \episteuth&#275;san\. \Logion\ is probably a diminutive of<br>
 \logos\, word, though the adjective \logios\ also occurs <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 18:24)</i></b>. The word was early used for "oracles" from Delphi and is<br>
 common in the LXX for the oracles of the Lord. But from Philo on<br>
 it was used of any sacred writing including narrative. It occurs<br>
 four times in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 7:38, which see; <!-#-->Ro 3:2; Heb 5:12;<br>
 1Pe 4:11)</i></b>. It is possible that here and in <!-#-->Ac 7:38 the idea<br>
 may include all the Old Testament, though the commands and<br>
 promises of God may be all.<br>
 <br>
 3:3 <B>{For what if?}</B> <b><i>(\ti gar ei?\)</i></b>. But Westcott and Hort print<br>
 it, \Ti gar? ei\. See <!-#-->Php 1:18 for this exclamatory use of \ti<br>
 gar\ <b><i>(for how? How stands the case?)</i></b>. <B>{Some were without faith}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;pist&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of \apiste&#333;\, old<br>
 verb, to disbelieve. This is the common N.T. meaning <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 24:11,41; Ac 28:24; Ro 4:20)</i></b>. Some of them "disbelieved," these<br>
 "depositaries and guardians of revelation" <b><i>(Denney)</i></b>. But the word<br>
 also means to be unfaithful to one's trust and Lightfoot argues<br>
 for that idea here and in <!-#-->2Ti 2:13. The Revised Version renders<br>
 it "faithless" there. Either makes sense here and both ideas are<br>
 true of some of the Jews, especially concerning the Messianic<br>
 promises and Jesus. <B>{The faithfulness of God}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n pistin tou<br>
 theou\)</i></b>. Undoubtedly \pistis\ has this sense here and not<br>
 "faith." God has been faithful <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 2:13)</i></b> whether the Jews<br>
 <b><i>(some of them)</i></b> were simply disbelievers or untrue to their trust.<br>
 Paul can use the words in two senses in verse <!-#-->3, but there is<br>
 no real objection to taking \&#275;pist&#275;san, apistian, pistin\, all to<br>
 refer to faithfulness rather than just faith.<br>
 <br>
 3:4 <B>{Let God be found true}</B> <b><i>(\ginesth&#333; ho theos al&#275;th&#275;s\)</i></b>. "Let<br>
 God continue to be true" <b><i>(present middle imperative)</i></b>. <B>{But every<br>
 man a liar}</B> <b><i>(\p&#257;s de anthr&#333;pos pseust&#275;s\)</i></b>. The contrast in \de\<br>
 really means, "though every man be found a liar." Cf. <!-#-->Ps<br>
 116:12. <B>{As it is written}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s gegraptai\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Ps 51:6.<br>
 <B>{That thou mightest be justified}</B> <b><i>(\hop&#333;s an dikai&#333;th&#275;is\)</i></b>.<br>
 \Hop&#333;s\ rather than the common \hina\ for purpose and \an\ with<br>
 the first aorist passive subjunctive of \dikaio&#333;\. Used of God<br>
 this verb here has to mean "declared righteous," not "made<br>
 righteous." <B>{Mightest prevail}</B> <b><i>(\nik&#275;seis\)</i></b>. Future active<br>
 indicative with \hop&#333;s\ of \nika&#333;\, to win a victory, though B L<br>
 have \nik&#275;s&#275;is\ <b><i>(first aorist active subjunctive, the usual<br>
 construction)</i></b>. <B>{When thou comest into judgement}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i<br>
 krinesthai se\)</i></b>. "In the being judged as to thee" <b><i>(present<br>
 passive infinitive or, if taken as middle, "in the entering upon<br>
 trial as to thee")</i></b>. Common construction in the LXX from the<br>
 Hebrew infinitive construct.<br>
 <br>
 3:5 <B>{What shall we say?}</B> <b><i>(\ti eroumen?\)</i></b>. Rhetorical question,<br>
 common with Paul as he surveys the argument. <B>{Commendeth}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sunist&#275;sin\)</i></b>. This common verb \sunist&#275;mi\, to send together,<br>
 occurs in the N.T. in two senses, either to introduce, to commend<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 3:1; 4:2)</i></b> or to prove, to establish <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 7:11; Ga 2:18;<br>
 Ro 5:8)</i></b>. Either makes good sense here. <B>{Who visiteth the wrath}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ho epipher&#333;n t&#275;n org&#275;n\)</i></b>. "Who brings on the wrath," "the<br>
 inflicter of the anger" <b><i>(Vaughan)</i></b>. <B>{I speak as a man}</B> <b><i>(\kata<br>
 anthr&#333;pon\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ga 3:15 for same phrase. As if to say, "pardon<br>
 me for this line of argument." Tholuck says that the rabbis often<br>
 used \kata anthr&#333;pon\ and \ti eroumen\. Paul had not forgotten<br>
 his rabbinical training.<br>
 <br>
 3:6 <B>{For then how}</B> <b><i>(\epei p&#333;s\)</i></b>. There is a suppressed condition<br>
 between \epei\ and \p&#333;s\, an idiom occurring several times in the<br>
 N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:29; Ro 11:6,22)</i></b>. "Since, if that were true, how."<br>
 <br>
 3:7 <B>{Through my lie}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i em&#333;i pseusmati\)</i></b>. ] Old word from<br>
 \pseudomai\, to lie, only here in N.T. Paul returns to the<br>
 imaginary objection in verse <!-#-->5. The MSS. differ sharply here<br>
 between \ei de\ <b><i>(but if)</i></b> and \ei gar\ <b><i>(for if)</i></b>. Paul "uses the<br>
 first person from motives of delicacy" <b><i>(Sanday and Headlam)</i></b> in<br>
 this supposable case for argument's sake as in <!-#-->1Co 4:6. So here<br>
 he "transfers by a fiction" <b><i>(Field)</i></b> to himself the objection.<br>
 <br>
 3:8 <B>{And why not}</B> <b><i>(\kai m&#275;\)</i></b>. We have a tangled sentence which<br>
 can be cleared up in two ways. One is <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b> to supply<br>
 \gen&#275;tai\ after \m&#275;\ and repeat \ti\ <b><i>(\kai ti m&#275; gen&#275;tai\,<br>
 deliberative subjunctive in a question)</i></b>: And why should it not<br>
 happen? The other way <b><i>(Sanday and Headlam)</i></b> is to take \m&#275;\ with<br>
 \poi&#275;s&#333;men\ and make a long parenthesis of all in between. Even<br>
 so it is confusing because \hoti\ also <b><i>(recitative \hoti\)</i></b> comes<br>
 just before \poi&#275;s&#333;men\. The parenthesis is necessary anyhow, for<br>
 there are two lines of thought, one the excuse brought forward by<br>
 the unbeliever, the other the accusation that Paul affirms that<br>
 very excuse that we may do evil that good may come. Note the<br>
 double indirect assertion <b><i>(the accusative and the infinitive<br>
 \h&#275;m&#257;s legein\ after \phasin\ and then the direct quotation with<br>
 recitative \hoti\ after \legein\, a direct quotation dependent on<br>
 the infinitive in indirect quotation.)</i></b> <B>{Let us do evil that good<br>
 may come}</B> <b><i>(\poi&#275;s&#333;men ta kaka hina elth&#275;i ta agatha\)</i></b>. The<br>
 volitive aorist subjunctive <b><i>(\poi&#275;s&#333;men\)</i></b> and the clause of<br>
 purpose <b><i>(\hina\ and the aorist subjunctive \elth&#275;i\)</i></b>. It sounds<br>
 almost uncanny to find this maxim of the Jesuits attributed to<br>
 Paul in the first century by Jews. It was undoubtedly the<br>
 accusation of Antinomianism because Paul preached justification<br>
 by faith and not by works.<br>
 <br>
 3:9 <B>{What then?}</B> <b><i>(\ti oun?\)</i></b>. Paul's frequent query, to be taken<br>
 with verses <!-#-->1,2. <B>{Are we in worse case than they?}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\proechometha?\)</i></b>. The American Revisers render it: "Are we in<br>
 better case than they?" There is still no fresh light on this<br>
 difficult and common word though it occurs alone in the N.T. In<br>
 the active it means to have before, to excel. But here it is<br>
 either middle or passive. Thayer takes it to be middle and to<br>
 mean to excel to one's advantage and argues that the context<br>
 demands this. But no example of the middle in this sense has been<br>
 found. If it is taken as passive, Lightfoot takes it to mean,<br>
 "Are we excelled" and finds that sense in Plutarch. Vaughan takes<br>
 it as passive but meaning, "Are we preferred?" This suits the<br>
 context, but no other example has been found. So the point<br>
 remains unsettled. The papyri throw no light on it. <B>{No, in no<br>
 wise}</B> <b><i>(\ou pant&#333;s\)</i></b>. "Not at all." See <!-#-->1Co 5:10. <B>{We before<br>
 laid to the charge}</B> <b><i>(\pro&#275;itiasametha\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 indicative of \proaitiaomai\, to make a prior accusation, a word<br>
 not yet found anywhere else. Paul refers to <!-#-->1:18-32 for the<br>
 Greeks and <!-#-->2:1-29 for the Jews. The infinitive \einai\ with the<br>
 accusative \pantas\ is in indirect discourse. <B>{Under sin}</B> <b><i>(\hupo<br>
 hamartian\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ga 3:22; Ro 7:14.<br>
 <br>
 3:10 <B>{As it is written}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s gegraptai hoti\)</i></b>. Usual formula<br>
 of quotation as in verse <!-#-->4 with recitative \hoti\ added as in<br>
 verse <!-#-->8. Paul here uses a catena or chain of quotations to<br>
 prove his point in verse <!-#-->9 that Jews are in no better fix than<br>
 the Greeks for all are under sin. Dr. J. Rendel Harris has shown<br>
 that the Jews and early Christians had _Testimonia_ <b><i>(quotations<br>
 from the Old Testament)</i></b> strung together for certain purposes as<br>
 proof-texts. Paul may have used one of them or he may have put<br>
 these passages together himself. Verses <!-#-->10-12 come from <!-#-->Ps<br>
 14:1-3; first half of <!-#-->13 as far as \edoliousan\ from <!-#-->Ps 4:9,<br>
 the second half from <!-#-->Ps 140:3; verse <!-#-->14 from <!-#-->Ps 10:7;<br>
 <!-#-->15-17 from an abridgment of <!-#-->Isa 59:7f.; verse <!-#-->18 from <!-#-->Ps<br>
 35:1. Paul has given compounded quotations elsewhere <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 6:16;<br>
 Ro 9:25f.,27f; 11:26f.,34f.; 12:19f.)</i></b>. Curiously enough this<br>
 compounded quotation was imported bodily into the text <b><i>(LXX)</i></b> of<br>
 <!-#-->Ps 14 after verse 4 in Aleph B, etc. <B>{There is none righteous,<br>
 no, not one}</B> <b><i>(\ouk estin dikaios oude heis\)</i></b>. "There is not a<br>
 righteous man, not even one." This sentence is like a motto for<br>
 all the rest, a summary for what follows.<br>
 <br>
 3:11 <B>{That understandeth}</B> <b><i>(\suni&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present active participle<br>
 of \suni&#333;\, late omega form of \-mi\ verb \suni&#275;mi\, to send<br>
 together, to grasp, to comprehend. Some MSS. have the article<br>
 \ho\ before it as before \ekz&#275;t&#333;n\ <b><i>(seeking out)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:12 <B>{They are together become unprofitable}</B> <b><i>(\hama<br>
 &#275;chre&#333;th&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of \achreo&#333;\.<br>
 Late word in Polybius and Cilician inscription of first century<br>
 A.D. Some MSS. read \&#275;chrei&#333;th&#275;san\ from \achreios\, useless <b><i>(\a\<br>
 privative and \chreios\, useful)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Lu 17:10; Mt 25:30, but<br>
 Westcott and Hort print as above from the rarer spelling<br>
 \achreos\. Only here in N.T. The Hebrew word means to go bad,<br>
 become sour like milk <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. <B>{No, not so much as one}</B> <b><i>(\ouk<br>
 estin he&#333;s henos\)</i></b>. "There is not up to one."<br>
 <br>
 3:13 <B>{Throat}</B> <b><i>(\larugx\)</i></b>. Old word, larynx. <B>{Open sepulchre}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\taphos ane&#333;igmenos\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of \anoig&#333;\,<br>
 "an opened grave." Their mouth <b><i>(words)</i></b> like the odour of a newly<br>
 opened grave. "Some portions of Greek and Roman literature stink<br>
 like a newly opened grave" <b><i>(Shedd)</i></b>. <B>{They have used deceit}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\edoliousan\)</i></b>. Imperfect <b><i>(not perfect or aorist as the English<br>
 implies)</i></b> active of \dolio&#333;\, only in LXX and here in the N.T.<br>
 from the common adjective \dolios\, deceitful <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:13)</i></b>. The<br>
 regular form would be \edolioun\. The \-osan\ ending for third<br>
 plural in imperfect and aorist was once thought to be purely<br>
 Alexandrian because so common in the LXX, but it is common in the<br>
 Boeotian and Aeolic dialects and occurs in \eichosan\ in the N.T.<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 15:22,24)</i></b>. "They smoothed their tongues" in the Hebrew.<br>
 <B>{Poison}</B> <b><i>(\ios\)</i></b>. Old word both for rust <b><i>(<!-#-->Jas 5:3)</i></b> and poison<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Jas 3:8)</i></b>. <B>{Of asps}</B> <b><i>(\aspid&#333;n\)</i></b>. Common word for round bowl,<br>
 shield, then the Egyptian cobra <b><i>(a deadly serpent)</i></b>. Often in LXX.<br>
 Only here in the N.T. The poison of the asp lies in a bag under<br>
 the lips <b><i>(\cheil&#275;\)</i></b>, often in LXX, only here in N.T. Genitive<br>
 case after \gemei\ <b><i>(is full)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:15 <B>{To shed}</B> <b><i>(\ekcheai\)</i></b>. First aorist active infinitive of<br>
 \ekche&#333;\, to pour out, old verb with aorist active \exechea\.<br>
 <br>
 3:16 <B>{Destruction}</B> <b><i>(\suntrimma\)</i></b>. Rare word from \suntrib&#333;\, to<br>
 rub together, to crush. In <!-#-->Le 21:19 for fracture and so in<br>
 papyri. Only here in N.T. <B>{Misery}</B> <b><i>(\talaip&#333;ria\)</i></b>. Common word<br>
 from \talaip&#333;ros\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 7:24)</i></b>, only here in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 3:17 <B>{The way of peace}</B> <b><i>(\hodon eir&#275;n&#275;s\)</i></b>. Wherever they go they<br>
 leave a trail of woe and destruction <b><i>(Denney)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:18 <B>{Before}</B> <b><i>(\apenanti\)</i></b>. Late double compound <b><i>(\apo, en,<br>
 anti\)</i></b> adverbial preposition in LXX and Polybius, papyri and<br>
 inscriptions. With genitive as here.<br>
 <br>
 3:19 <B>{That every mouth may be stopped}</B> <b><i>(\hina p&#257;n stoma<br>
 phrag&#275;i\)</i></b>. Purpose clause with \hina\ and second aorist passive<br>
 subjunctive of \phrass&#333;\, old verb to fence in, to block up. See<br>
 <!-#-->2Co 11:10. Stopping mouths is a difficult business. See <!-#-->Tit<br>
 1:11 where Paul uses \epistomizein\ <b><i>(to stop up the mouth)</i></b> for<br>
 the same idea. Paul seems here to be speaking directly to Jews<br>
 <b><i>(\tois en t&#333;i nom&#333;i\)</i></b>, the hardest to convince. With the previous<br>
 proof on that point he covers the whole ground for he made the<br>
 case against the Gentiles in <!-#-->1:18-32. <B>{May be brought under the<br>
 judgement of God}</B> <b><i>(\hupodikos gen&#275;tai t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>. "That all the<br>
 world <b><i>(Jew as well as Gentile)</i></b> may become <b><i>(\gen&#275;tai\)</i></b> answerable<br>
 <b><i>(\hupodikos\, old forensic word, here only in N.T.)</i></b> to God<br>
 <b><i>(dative case \t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>." Every one is "liable to God," in<br>
 God's court.<br>
 <br>
 3:20 <B>{Because}</B> <b><i>(\dioti\, again, \dia, hoti\)</i></b>. <B>{By the works of<br>
 the law}</B> <b><i>(\ex erg&#333;n nomou\)</i></b>. "Out of works of law." Mosaic law<br>
 and any law as the source of being set right with God. Paul<br>
 quotes <!-#-->Ps 43:2 as he did in <!-#-->Ga 2:16 to prove his point. <B>{The<br>
 knowledge of sin}</B> <b><i>(\epign&#333;sis hamartias\)</i></b>. The effect of law<br>
 universally is rebellion to it <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:56)</i></b>. Paul has shown this<br>
 carefully in <!-#-->Ga 3:19-22. Cf. <!-#-->Heb 10:3. He has now proven the<br>
 guilt of both Gentile and Jew.<br>
 <br>
 3:21 <B>{But now apart from the law}</B> <b><i>(\nuni de ch&#333;ris nomou\)</i></b>. He<br>
 now <b><i>(\nuni\ emphatic logical transition)</i></b> proceeds carefully in<br>
 verses <!-#-->21-31 the <B>{nature}</B> of the God-kind of righteousness<br>
 which stands manifested <b><i>(\dikaiosun&#275; theou pephaner&#333;tai\, perfect<br>
 passive indicative of \phanero&#333;\, to make manifest)</i></b>, the<br>
 <B>{necessity}</B> of which he has shown in <!-#-->1:18-3:20. This God kind<br>
 of righteousness is "apart from law" of any kind and all of grace<br>
 <b><i>(\chariti\)</i></b> as he will show in verse <!-#-->24. But it is not a new<br>
 discovery on the part of Paul, but "witnessed by the law and the<br>
 prophets" <b><i>(\marturoumen&#275;\, present passive participle, \hupo tou<br>
 nomou kai t&#333;n proph&#275;t&#333;n\)</i></b>, made plain continuously by God<br>
 himself.<br>
 <br>
 3:22 <B>{Even}</B> <b><i>(\de\)</i></b>. Not adversative here. It defines here.<br>
 <B>{Through faith in Jesus Christ}</B> <b><i>(\dia piste&#333;s [I&#275;sou] Christou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Intermediate agency <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> is faith and objective genitive, "in<br>
 Jesus Christ," not subjective "of Jesus Christ," in spite of<br>
 Haussleiter's contention for that idea. The objective nature of<br>
 faith in Christ is shown in <!-#-->Ga 2:16 by the addition \eis<br>
 Christon I&#275;soun episteusamen\ <b><i>(we believed in Christ)</i></b>, by \t&#275;s<br>
 eis Christon piste&#333;s hum&#333;n\ <b><i>(of your faith in Christ)</i></b> in <!-#-->Col<br>
 2:5, by \en pistei t&#275;i en Christ&#333;i I&#275;sou\ <b><i>(in faith that in<br>
 Christ Jesus)</i></b> in <!-#-->1Ti 3:13, as well as here by the added words<br>
 "unto all them that believe" <b><i>(\eis pantas tous pisteuontas\)</i></b> in<br>
 Jesus, Paul means. <B>{Distinction}</B> <b><i>(\diastol&#275;\)</i></b>. See on &#175;1Co 14:7<br>
 for the difference of sounds in musical instruments. Also in <!-#-->Ro<br>
 10:12. The Jew was first in privilege as in penalty <b><i>(<!-#-->2:9f.)</i></b>,<br>
 but justification or setting right with God is offered to both on<br>
 the same terms.<br>
 <br>
 3:23 <B>{Sinned}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;rmarton\)</i></b>. Constative second aorist active<br>
 indicative of \hamartan&#333;\ as in <!-#-->5:12. This tense gathers up the<br>
 whole race into one statement <b><i>(a timeless aorist)</i></b>. <B>{And fall<br>
 short}</B> <b><i>(\kai husterountai\)</i></b>. Present middle indicative of<br>
 \hustere&#333;\, to be \husteros\ <b><i>(comparative)</i></b> too late, continued<br>
 action, still fall short. It is followed by the ablative case as<br>
 here, the case of separation.<br>
 <br>
 3:24 <B>{Being justified}</B> <b><i>(\dikaioumenoi\)</i></b>. Present passive<br>
 participle of \dikaio&#333;\, to set right, repeated action in each<br>
 case, each being set right. <B>{Freely}</B> <b><i>(\d&#333;rean\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->Ga 2:21.<br>
 <B>{By his grace}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i autou chariti\)</i></b>. Instrumental case of this<br>
 wonderful word \charis\ which so richly expresses Paul's idea of<br>
 salvation as God's free gift. <B>{Through the redemption}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#275;s<br>
 apolutr&#333;se&#333;s\)</i></b>. A releasing by ransom <b><i>(\apo, lutr&#333;sis\ from<br>
 \lutro&#333;\ and that from \lutron\, ransom)</i></b>. God did not set men<br>
 right out of hand with nothing done about men's sins. We have the<br>
 words of Jesus that he came to give his life a ransom <b><i>(\lutron\)</i></b><br>
 for many <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 10:45; Mt 20:28)</i></b>. \Lutron\ is common in the papyri<br>
 as the purchase-money in freeing slaves <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light from<br>
 the Ancient East_, pp. 327f.)</i></b>. <B>{That is in Christ Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i en<br>
 Christ&#333;i I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. There can be no mistake about this redemption.<br>
 It is like <!-#-->Joh 3:16.<br>
 <br>
 3:25 <B>{Set forth}</B> <b><i>(\proetheto\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle indicative.<br>
 See on &#175;1:13 for this word. Also in <!-#-->Eph 1:9, but nowhere else<br>
 in N.T. God set before himself <b><i>(purposed)</i></b> and did it publicly<br>
 before <b><i>(\pro\)</i></b> the whole world. <B>{A propitiation}</B> <b><i>(\hilast&#275;rion\)</i></b>.<br>
 The only other N.T. example of this word is in <!-#-->Heb 9:5 where we<br>
 have the "cherubim overshadowing the mercy seat" <b><i>(\to<br>
 hilast&#275;rion\)</i></b>. In Hebrews the adjective is used as a substantive<br>
 or as "the propitiatory place " But that idea does not suit here.<br>
 Deissmann <b><i>(_Bible Studies_, pp. 124-35)</i></b> has produced examples<br>
 from inscriptions where it is used as an adjective and as meaning<br>
 "a votive offering" or "propitiatory gift." Hence he concludes<br>
 about <!-#-->Ro 3:25: "The crucified Christ is the votive gift of the<br>
 Divine Love for the salvation of men." God gave his Son as the<br>
 means of propitiation <b><i>(<!-#-->1Jo 2:2)</i></b>. \Hilast&#275;rion\ is an adjective<br>
 <b><i>(\hilast&#275;rios\)</i></b> from \hilaskomai\, to make propitiation <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb<br>
 2:17)</i></b> and is kin in meaning to \hilasmos\, propitiation <b><i>(<!-#-->1Jo<br>
 2:2; 4:10)</i></b>. There is no longer room for doubting its meaning in<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 3:25. <B>{Through faith, by his blood}</B> <b><i>(\dia piste&#333;s en t&#333;i<br>
 autou haimati\)</i></b>. So probably, connecting \en toi haimati\ <b><i>(in his<br>
 blood)</i></b> with \proetheto\. <B>{To show his righteousness}</B> <b><i>(\eis<br>
 endeixin t&#275;s dikaiosun&#275;s autou\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->2Co 8:24. "For showing of<br>
 his righteousness," the God-kind of righteousness. God could not<br>
 let sin go as if a mere slip. God demanded the atonement and<br>
 provided it. <B>{Because of the passing over}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#275;n paresin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Late word from \pari&#275;mi\, to let go, to relax. In Dionysius Hal.,<br>
 Xenophon, papyri <b><i>(Deissmann, _Bible Studies_, p. 266)</i></b> for<br>
 remission of punishment, especially for debt, as distinct from<br>
 \aphesis\ <b><i>(remission)</i></b>. <B>{Done aforetime}</B> <b><i>(\progegonot&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 perfect active genitive participle of \proginomai\. The sins<br>
 before the coming of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 14:16; 17:30; Heb 9:15)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Forbearance}</B> <b><i>(\anoch&#275;i\)</i></b>. Holding back of God as in <!-#-->2:4. In<br>
 this sense Christ tasted death for every man <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 2:9)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:26 <B>{For the shewing}</B> <b><i>(\pros t&#275;n endeixin\)</i></b>. Repeats point of<br>
 \eis endeixin\ of <!-#-->25 with \pros\ instead of \eis\. <B>{At this<br>
 present season}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i nun kair&#333;i\)</i></b>. "In the now crisis," in<br>
 contrast with "done aforetime." <B>{That he might himself be}</B> <b><i>(\eis<br>
 to einai auton\)</i></b>. Purpose with \eis\ to and the infinitive<br>
 \einai\ and the accusative of general reference. <B>{Just and the<br>
 justifier of}</B> <b><i>(\dikaion kai dikaiounta\)</i></b>. "This is the key phrase<br>
 which establishes the connexion between the \dikaiosun&#275; theou\<br>
 and the \dikaiosun&#275; ek piste&#333;s\" <b><i>(Sanday and Headlam)</i></b>. Nowhere<br>
 has Paul put the problem of God more acutely or profoundly. To<br>
 pronounce the unrighteous righteous is unjust by itself <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro<br>
 4:5)</i></b>. God's mercy would not allow him to leave man to his fate.<br>
 God's justice demanded some punishment for sin. The only possible<br>
 way to save some was the propitiatory offering of Christ and the<br>
 call for faith on man's part.<br>
 <br>
 3:27 <B>{It is excluded}</B> <b><i>(\exekleisth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b><br>
 passive indicative. "It is completely shut out." Glorying is on<br>
 man's part. <B>{Nay; but by a law of faith}</B> <b><i>(\ouchi, alla dia nomou<br>
 piste&#333;s\)</i></b>. Strong negative, and note "law of faith," by the<br>
 principle of faith in harmony with God's love and grace.<br>
 <br>
 3:28 <B>{We reckon therefore}</B> <b><i>(\logizometha oun\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 indicative. Westcott and Hort read \gar\ instead of \oun\. "My<br>
 fixed opinion" is. The accusative and infinitive construction<br>
 occurs after \logizometha\ here. On this verb \logizomai\, see<br>
 <!-#-->2:3; 4:3f.; 8:18; 14:14. Paul restates verses <!-#-->21f.<br>
 <br>
 3:29 <B>{Of Gentiles also}</B> <b><i>(\kai ethn&#333;n\)</i></b>. Jews overlooked it then<br>
 and some Christians do now.<br>
 <br>
 3:30 <B>{If so be that God is one}</B> <b><i>(\eiper heis ho theos\)</i></b>. Correct<br>
 text rather than \epeiper\. It means "if on the whole." "By a<br>
 species of rhetorical politeness it is used of that about which<br>
 there is no doubt" <b><i>(Thayer. Cf. <!-#-->1Co 8:5; 15:15; Ro 8:9. <B>{By<br>
 faith}</B> (\ek piste&#333;s\)</i></b>. "Out of faith," springing out of. <B>{Through<br>
 faith}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#275;s piste&#333;s\)</i></b>. "By means of the faith" <b><i>(just<br>
 mentioned)</i></b>. \Ek\ denotes source, \dia\ intermediate agency or<br>
 attendant circumstance.<br>
 <br>
 3:31 <B>{Nay, we establish the law}</B> <b><i>(\alla nomon histanomen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present indicative active of late verb \histan&#333;\ from \hist&#275;mi\.<br>
 This Paul hinted at in verse <!-#-->21. How he will show in chapter 4<br>
 how Abraham himself is an example of faith and in his life<br>
 illustrates the very point just made. Besides, apart from Christ<br>
 and the help of the Holy Spirit no one can keep God's law. The<br>
 Mosaic law is only workable by faith in Christ.<br>
