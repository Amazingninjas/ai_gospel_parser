<p>25:1 <B>{Ten virgins}</B> <b><i>(\deka parthenois\)</i></b>. No special point in the<br>
 number ten. The scene is apparently centered round the house of<br>
 the bride to which the bridegroom is coming for the wedding<br>
 festivities. But Plummer places the scene near the house of the<br>
 bridegroom who has gone to bring the bride home. It is not<br>
 pertinent to the point of the parable to settle it. <B>{Lamps}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\lampadas\)</i></b>. Probably torches with a wooden staff and a dish on<br>
 top in which was placed a piece of rope or cloth dipped in oil or<br>
 pitch. But sometimes \lampas\ has the meaning of oil lamp<br>
 <b><i>(\luchnos\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Ac 20:8. That may be the meaning here<br>
 <b><i>(Rutherford, _New Phrynichus_)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 25:3 <B>{Took no oil with them}</B> <b><i>(\ouk elabon meth' heaut&#333;n elaion\)</i></b>.<br>
 Probably none at all, not realizing their lack of oil till they<br>
 lit the torches on the arrival of the bridegroom and his party.<br>
 <br>
 25:4 <B>{In their vessels}</B> <b><i>(\en tois aggeiois\)</i></b>. Here alone in the<br>
 N.T., through \agg&#275;\ in <!-#-->13:48. Extra supply in these<br>
 receptacles besides the oil in the dish on top of the staff.<br>
 <br>
 25:5 <B>{They all slumbered and slept}</B> <b><i>(\enustaxan p&#257;sai kai<br>
 ekatheudon\)</i></b>. They dropped off to sleep, nodded <b><i>(ingressive<br>
 aorist)</i></b> and then went on sleeping <b><i>(imperfect, linear action)</i></b>, a<br>
 vivid picture drawn by the difference in the two tenses. Many a<br>
 preacher has seen this happen while he is preaching.<br>
 <br>
 25:6 <B>{There is a cry}</B> <b><i>(\kraug&#275; gegonen\)</i></b>. A cry has come.<br>
 Dramatic use of the present perfect <b><i>(second perfect active)</i></b><br>
 indicative, not the perfect for the aorist. It is not \estin\,<br>
 but \gegonen\ which emphasizes the sudden outcry which has rent<br>
 the air. The very memory of it is preserved by this tense with<br>
 all the bustle and confusion, the rushing to the oil-venders.<br>
 <B>{Come ye forth to meet him}</B> <b><i>(\exerchesthe eis apant&#275;sin\)</i></b>. Or, Go<br>
 out for meeting him, dependent on whether the cry comes from<br>
 outside the house or inside the house where they were sleeping<br>
 because of the delay. It was a ceremonial salutation neatly<br>
 expressed by the Greek phrase.<br>
 <br>
 25:7 <B>{Trimmed}</B> <b><i>(\ekosm&#275;san\)</i></b>. Put in order, made ready. The wicks<br>
 were trimmed, the lights being out while they slept, fresh oil<br>
 put in the dish, and lit again. A marriage ceremony in India is<br>
 described by Ward <b><i>(_View of the Hindoos_)</i></b> in Trench's _Parables_:<br>
 "After waiting two or three hours, at length near midnight it was<br>
 announced, as in the very words of Scripture, 'Behold the<br>
 bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.'"<br>
 <br>
 25:8 <B>{Are going out}</B> <b><i>(\sbennuntai\)</i></b>. Present middle indicative of<br>
 linear action, not punctiliar or aoristic. When the five foolish<br>
 virgins lit their lamps, they discovered the lack of oil. The<br>
 sputtering, flickering, smoking wicks were a sad revelation. "And<br>
 _perhaps_ we are to understand that there is something in the<br>
 coincidence of the lamps going out just as the Bridegroom<br>
 arrived. Mere outward religion is found to have no illuminating<br>
 power" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 25:9 <B>{Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275;pote ou m&#275; arkesei h&#275;m&#338;n kai hum&#338;n\)</i></b>. There is an elliptical<br>
 construction here that is not easy of explanation. Some MSS.<br>
 Aleph A L Z have \ouk\ instead of \ou m&#275;\. But even so \m&#275; pote\<br>
 has to be explained either by supplying an imperative like<br>
 \ginesth&#333;\ or by a verb of fearing like \phoboumetha\ <b><i>(this most<br>
 likely)</i></b>. Either \ouk\ or \ou m&#275;\ would be proper with the<br>
 futuristic subjunctive \arkesei\ <b><i>(Moulton, _Prolegomena_, p. 192;<br>
 Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 1161,1174)</i></b>. "We are afraid that there<br>
 is no possibility of there being enough for us both." This is a<br>
 denial of oil by the wise virgins because there was not enough<br>
 for both. "It was necessary to show that the foolish virgins<br>
 could not have the consequences of their folly averted at the<br>
 last moment" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. It is a courteous reply, but it is<br>
 decisive. The compound Greek negatives are very expressive,<br>
 \m&#275;pote--ou m&#275;\.<br>
 <br>
 25:10 <B>{And while they went away}</B> <b><i>(\aperchomen&#333;n de aut&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present middle participle, genitive absolute, while they were<br>
 going away, descriptive linear action. Picture of their<br>
 inevitable folly. <B>{Was shut}</B> <b><i>(\ekleisth&#275;\)</i></b>. Effective aorist<br>
 passive indicative, shut to stay shut.<br>
 <br>
 25:11 <B>{Afterward}</B> <b><i>(\husteron\)</i></b>. And find the door shut in their<br>
 faces. <B>{Lord, Lord, open to us}</B> <b><i>(\Kurie, Kurie, anoixon h&#275;min\)</i></b>.<br>
 They appeal to the bridegroom who is now master whether he is at<br>
 the bride's house or his own.<br>
 <br>
 25:12 <B>{I know you not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk oida hum&#257;s\)</i></b>. Hence there was no<br>
 reason for special or unusual favours to be granted them. They<br>
 must abide the consequences of their own negligence.<br>
 <br>
 25:13 <B>{Watch therefore}</B> <b><i>(\gr&#275;goreite oun\)</i></b>. This is the refrain<br>
 with all the parables. Lack of foresight is inexcusable.<br>
 Ignorance of the time of the second coming is not an excuse for<br>
 neglect, but a reason for readiness. Every preacher goes up<br>
 against this trait in human nature, putting off till another time<br>
 what should be done today.<br>
 <br>
 25:14 <B>{Going into another country}</B> <b><i>(\apod&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. About to go away<br>
 from one's people <b><i>(\d&#275;mos\)</i></b>, on the point of going abroad. This<br>
 word in ancient use in this sense. There is an ellipse here that<br>
 has to be supplied, <B>{It is as when}</B> or <B>{The kingdom of heaven is<br>
 as when}</B>. This Parable of the Talents is quite similar to the<br>
 Parable of the Pounds in <!-#-->Lu 19:11-28, but they are not<br>
 variations of the same story. Some scholars credit Jesus with<br>
 very little versatility. <B>{His goods}</B> <b><i>(\ta huparchonta autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 His belongings, neuter participle used as a substantive.<br>
 <br>
 25:15 <B>{To one}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;i men, h&#333;i de, h&#333;i de\)</i></b>. Demonstrative \hos\,<br>
 not the relative. Neat Greek idiom. <B>{According to his several<br>
 ability}</B> <b><i>(\kata t&#275;n idian dunamin\)</i></b>. According to his own<br>
 ability. Each had all that he was capable of handling. The use<br>
 that one makes of his opportunities is the measure of his<br>
 capacity for more. One talent represented a considerable amount<br>
 of money at that time when a \denarius\ was a day's wage. See on<br>
 &#175;18:24 for the value of a talent.<br>
 <br>
 25:16 <B>{Straightway}</B> <b><i>(\euthe&#333;s\)</i></b>. Beginning of verse 16, not the<br>
 end of verse <!-#-->15. The business temper of this slave is shown by<br>
 his promptness. <B>{With them}</B> <b><i>(\en autois\)</i></b>. Instrumental use of<br>
 \en\. He worked <b><i>(\&#275;rgasato\)</i></b>, did business, traded with them.<br>
 "The virgins wait, the servants work" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. <B>{Made}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epoi&#275;sen\)</i></b>. But Westcott and Hort read \ekerd&#275;sen\, gained, as<br>
 in verse <!-#-->17. \Kerdos\ means interest. This gain was a hundred<br>
 per cent.<br>
 <br>
 25:19 <B>{Maketh a reckoning}</B> <b><i>(\sunairei logon\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->18:23.<br>
 Deissmann <b><i>(_Light from the Ancient East_, p. 117)</i></b> gives two<br>
 papyri quotations with this very business idiom and one Nubian<br>
 ostracon with it. The ancient Greek writers do not show it.<br>
 <br>
 25:21 <B>{The joy of thy lord}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n charin tou kuriou sou\)</i></b>. The<br>
 word \chara\ or joy may refer to the feast on the master's<br>
 return. So in verse <!-#-->23.<br>
 <br>
 25:24 <B>{That had received the one talent}</B> <b><i>(\ho to talenton<br>
 eil&#275;ph&#333;s\)</i></b>. Note the perfect active participle to emphasize the<br>
 fact that he still had it. In verse <!-#-->20 we have \ho--lab&#333;n\<br>
 <b><i>(aorist active participle)</i></b>. <B>{I knew thee}</B> <b><i>(\egn&#333;n se\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active indicative. Experimental knowledge <b><i>(\gin&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b> and<br>
 proleptical use of \se\. <B>{A hard man}</B> <b><i>(\skl&#275;ros\)</i></b>. Harsh, stern,<br>
 rough man, worse than \aust&#275;ros\ in <!-#-->Lu 19:21, grasping and<br>
 ungenerous. <B>{Where thou didst not scatter}</B> <b><i>(\hothen ou<br>
 dieskorpisas\)</i></b>. But this scattering was the chaff from which<br>
 wheat was winnowed, not the scattering of seed.<br>
 <br>
 25:26 <B>{Thou wicked and slothful servant}</B> <b><i>(\pon&#275;re doule kai<br>
 okn&#275;re\)</i></b>. From \ponos\ <b><i>(work, annoyance, disturbance, evil)</i></b> and<br>
 \okne&#333;\ <b><i>(to be slow, "poky," slothful)</i></b>. Westcott and Hort make a<br>
 question out of this reply to the end of verse <!-#-->26. It is<br>
 sarcasm.<br>
 <br>
 25:27 <B>{Thou oughtest therefore}</B> <b><i>(\edsi se oun\)</i></b>. His very words<br>
 of excuse convict him. It was a necessity <b><i>(\edei\)</i></b> that he did<br>
 not see. <B>{The bankers}</B> <b><i>(\tois trapezeitais\)</i></b>. The benchers,<br>
 money-changers, brokers, who exchanged money for a fee and who<br>
 paid interest on money. Word common in late Greek. <B>{I should have<br>
 received back}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; ekomisam&#275;n an\)</i></b>. Conclusion of a condition<br>
 of the second class <b><i>(determined as unfulfilled)</i></b>. The condition is<br>
 not expressed, but it is implied. "If you had done that." <B>{With<br>
 interest}</B> <b><i>(\sun tok&#333;i\)</i></b>. Not with "usury" in the sense of<br>
 extortion or oppression. Usury only means "use" in itself. The<br>
 word is from \tikt&#333;\, to bring forth. Compound interest at six<br>
 per cent doubles the principal every twenty years. It is amazing<br>
 how rapidly that piles up if one carries it on for centuries and<br>
 millenniums. "In the early Roman Empire legal interest was eight<br>
 per cent, but in usurious transactions it was lent at twelve,<br>
 twenty-four, and even forty-eight" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. Such practices<br>
 exist today in our cities. The Mosaic law did not allow interest<br>
 in dealings between Hebrews, but only with strangers <b><i>(<!-#-->De<br>
 23:19,20; Ps 15:5)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 25:30 <B>{The unprofitable}</B> <b><i>(\ton achreion\)</i></b>. Useless <b><i>(\a\ privative<br>
 and \chreios\, useful)</i></b> and so unprofitable, injurious. Doing<br>
 nothing is doing harm.<br>
 <br>
 25:32 <B>{All the nations}</B> <b><i>(panta ta ethn&#275;)</i></b>. Not just Gentiles, but<br>
 Jews also. Christians and non-Christians. This program for the<br>
 general judgment has been challenged by some scholars who regard<br>
 it as a composition by the evangelist to exalt Christ. But why<br>
 should not Christ say this if he is the Son of Man and the Son of<br>
 God and realized it? A "reduced" Christ has trouble with all the<br>
 Gospels, not merely with the Fourth Gospel, and no less with Q<br>
 and Mark than with Matthew and Luke. This is a majestic picture<br>
 with which to close the series of parables about readiness for<br>
 the second coming. Here is the program when he does come. "I am<br>
 aware that doubt is thrown on this passage by some critics. But<br>
 the doubt is most wanton. Where is the second brain that could<br>
 have invented anything so original and so sublime as vv.<br>
 <!-#-->35-40,42-45?" <b><i>(Sanday, _Life of Christ in Recent Research_, p.<br>
 128)</i></b>. <B>{As the shepherd separates}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;sper ho poim&#275;n aphorizei\)</i></b>.<br>
 A common figure in Palestine. The sheep are usually white and the<br>
 goats black. There are kids <b><i>(\eriph&#333;n, eriphia\)</i></b> which have<br>
 grazed together. The goats devastate a field of all herbage.<br>
 "Indeed they have extirpated many species of trees which once<br>
 covered the hills" <b><i>(Tristram, _Natural History of the Bible_, pp.<br>
 89f.)</i></b>. The shepherd stands at the gate and taps the sheep to go<br>
 to the right and the goats to the left.<br>
 <br>
 25:34 <B>{From the foundation of the world}</B> <b><i>(\apo katabol&#275;s<br>
 kosmou\)</i></b>. The eternal purpose of the Father for his elect in all<br>
 the nations. The Son of Man in verse <!-#-->31 is the King here seated<br>
 on the throne in judgment.<br>
 <br>
 25:36 <B>{Clothed me}</B> <b><i>(\periebalete me\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle<br>
 indicative, cast something around me. <B>{Visited me}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epeskepsasthe me\)</i></b>. Looked after, came to see. Our "visit" is<br>
 from Latin _viso, video_. Cf. our English "go to see."<br>
 <br>
 25:40 <B>{Ye did it unto me}</B> <b><i>(\emoi epoi&#275;sate\)</i></b>. Dative of personal<br>
 interest. Christ identifies himself with the needy and the<br>
 suffering. This conduct is proof of possession of love for Christ<br>
 and likeness to him.<br>
 <br>
 25:42 <B>{No meat}</B> <b><i>(\ouk ed&#333;kate moi phagein\)</i></b>. You did not give me<br>
 anything to eat. The repetition of the negative \ou\ in <!-#-->42 and<br>
 <!-#-->43 is like the falling of clods on the coffin or the tomb. It<br>
 is curious the surprise here shown both by the sheep and the<br>
 goats. Some sheep will think that they are goats and some goats<br>
 will think that they are sheep.<br>
 <br>
 25:46 <B>{Eternal punishment}</B> <b><i>(\kolasin ai&#333;nion\)</i></b>. The word<br>
 \kolasin\ comes from \kolaz&#333;\, to mutilate or prune. Hence those<br>
 who cling to the larger hope use this phrase to mean age-long<br>
 pruning that ultimately leads to salvation of the goats, as<br>
 disciplinary rather than penal. There is such a distinction as<br>
 Aristotle pointed out between \m&#333;ria\ <b><i>(vengeance)</i></b> and \kolasis\.<br>
 But the same adjective \ai&#333;nios\ is used with \kolasin\ and<br>
 \z&#333;&#275;n\. If by etymology we limit the scope of \kolasin\, we may<br>
 likewise have only age-long \z&#333;&#275;n\. There is not the slightest<br>
 indication in the words of Jesus here that the punishment is not<br>
 coeval with the life. We can leave all this to the King himself<br>
 who is the Judge. The difficulty to one's mind about conditional<br>
 chastisement is to think how a life of sin in hell can be changed<br>
 into a life of love and obedience. The word \ai&#333;nios\ <b><i>(from<br>
 \ai&#333;n\, age, \aevum, aei\)</i></b> means either without beginning or<br>
 without end or both. It comes as near to the idea of eternal as<br>
 the Greek can put it in one word. It is a difficult idea to put<br>
 into language. Sometimes we have "ages of ages" <b><i>(\ai&#333;nes t&#333;n<br>
 ai&#333;n&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
