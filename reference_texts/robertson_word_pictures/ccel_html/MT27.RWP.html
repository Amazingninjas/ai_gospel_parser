<p>27:1 <B>{Now when morning was come}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;ias de genomen&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute. After dawn came the Sanhedrin held a formal<br>
 meeting to condemn Jesus and so ratify the illegal trial during<br>
 the night <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 15:1; Lu 22:66-71)</i></b>. Luke gives the details of<br>
 this second ratification consultation. The phrase used, <B>{took<br>
 counsel}</B> <b><i>(\sumboulion elabon\)</i></b> is a Latin idiom <b><i>(_consilium<br>
 ceperunt_)</i></b> for \sunebouleusanto\.<br>
 <br>
 27:2 <B>{Delivered him up to Pilate the governor}</B> <b><i>(\pared&#333;kan<br>
 Peilat&#333;i t&#333;i h&#275;gemoni\)</i></b>. What they had done was all a form and a<br>
 farce. Pilate had the power of death, but they had greatly<br>
 enjoyed the condemnation and the buffeting of Jesus now in their<br>
 power bound as a condemned criminal. He was no longer the master<br>
 of assemblies in the temple, able to make the Sanhedrin cower<br>
 before him. He had been bound in the garden and was bound before<br>
 Annas <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:12,24)</i></b>, but may have been unbound before<br>
 Caiaphas.<br>
 <br>
 27:3 <B>{Repented himself}</B> <b><i>(\metamel&#275;theis\)</i></b>. Probably Judas saw<br>
 Jesus led away to Pilate and thus knew that the condemnation had<br>
 taken place. This verb <b><i>(first aorist passive participle of<br>
 \metamelomai\)</i></b> really means to be sorry afterwards like the<br>
 English word _repent_ from the Latin _repoenitet_, to have pain<br>
 again or afterwards. See the same verb \metamel&#275;theis\ in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 21:30 of the boy who became sorry and changed to obedience. The<br>
 word does not have an evil sense in itself. Paul uses it of his<br>
 sorrow for his sharp letter to the Corinthians, a sorrow that<br>
 ceased when good came of the letter <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 7:8)</i></b>. But mere sorrow<br>
 avails nothing unless it leads to change of mind and life<br>
 <b><i>(\metanoia\)</i></b>, the sorrow according to God <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 7:9)</i></b>. This<br>
 sorrow Peter had when he wept bitterly. It led Peter back to<br>
 Christ. But Judas had only remorse that led to suicide.<br>
 <br>
 27:4 <B>{See thou to it}</B> <b><i>(\su ops&#275;i\)</i></b>. Judas made a belated<br>
 confession of his sin in betraying innocent blood to the<br>
 Sanhedrin, but not to God, nor to Jesus. The Sanhedrin ignore the<br>
 innocent or righteous blood <b><i>(\haima ath&#333;ion\ or \dikaion\)</i></b> and<br>
 tell Judas to look after his own guilt himself. They ignore also<br>
 their own guilt in the matter. The use of \su ops&#275;i\ as a<br>
 volitive future, an equivalent of the imperative, is commoner in<br>
 Latin <b><i>(_tu videris_)</i></b> than in Greek, though the _Koin&#275;_ shows it<br>
 also. The sentiment is that of Cain <b><i>(Grotius, Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 27:5 <B>{Hanged himself}</B> <b><i>(\ap&#275;gxato\)</i></b>. Direct middle. His act was<br>
 sudden after he hurled the money into the sanctuary <b><i>(\eis ton<br>
 naon\)</i></b>, the sacred enclosure where the priests were. The motives<br>
 of Judas in the betrayal were mixed as is usually the case with<br>
 criminals. The money cut a small figure with him save as an<br>
 expression of contempt as the current price of a slave.<br>
 <br>
 27:6 <B>{Into the treasury}</B> <b><i>(\eis ton korban&#257;n\)</i></b>. Josephus <b><i>(_War_<br>
 II. 9,4)</i></b> uses this very word for the sacred treasury. _Korban_ is<br>
 Aramaic for _gift_ <b><i>(\d&#333;ron\)</i></b> as is plain in <!-#-->Mr 7:11. The price<br>
 of blood <b><i>(blood-money)</i></b> was pollution to the treasury <b><i>(<!-#-->De<br>
 23:18f.)</i></b>. So they took the money out and used it for a secular<br>
 purpose. The rabbis knew how to split hairs about _Korban_ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 7:1-23; Mt 15:1-20)</i></b>, but they balk at this blood-money.<br>
 <br>
 27:7 <B>{The potter's field}</B> <b><i>(\tou agrou tou kerame&#333;s\)</i></b>. Grotius<br>
 suggests that it was a small field where potter's clay was<br>
 obtained, like a brickyard <b><i>(Broadus)</i></b>. Otherwise we do not know<br>
 why the name exists. In <!-#-->Ac 1:18 we have another account of the<br>
 death of Judas by bursting open <b><i>(possibly falling after hanging<br>
 himself)</i></b> after he obtained the field by the wages of iniquity.<br>
 But it is possible that \ekt&#275;sato\ there refers to the rabbinical<br>
 use of _Korban_, that the money was still that of Judas though he<br>
 was dead and so he really "acquired" the field by his<br>
 blood-money.<br>
 <br>
 27:8 <B>{The field of blood}</B> <b><i>(\agros haimatos\)</i></b>. This name was<br>
 attached to it because it was the price of blood and that is not<br>
 inconsistent with <!-#-->Ac 1:18f. Today potter's field carries the<br>
 idea here started of burial place for strangers who have no where<br>
 else to lie <b><i>(\eis taph&#275;n tois xenois\)</i></b>, probably at first Jews<br>
 from elsewhere dying in Jerusalem. In <!-#-->Ac 1:19 it is called<br>
 <B>{Aceldama}</B> or <B>{place of blood}</B> <b><i>(\ch&#333;rion haimatos\)</i></b> for the<br>
 reason that Judas' blood was shed there, here because it was<br>
 purchased by blood money. Both reasons could be true.<br>
 <br>
 27:9 <B>{By Jeremiah the prophet}</B> <b><i>(\dia Ieremiou\)</i></b>. This quotation<br>
 comes mainly from <!-#-->Zec 11:13 though not in exact language. In<br>
 <!-#-->Jer 18:18 the prophet tells of a visit to a potter's house and<br>
 in <!-#-->Jer 32:6ff. of the purchase of a field. It is in Zechariah<br>
 that the thirty pieces of silver are mentioned. Many theories are<br>
 offered for the combination of Zechariah and Jeremiah and<br>
 attributing it all to Jeremiah as in <!-#-->Mr 1:2f. the quotation<br>
 from Isaiah and Malachi is referred wholly to Isaiah as the more<br>
 prominent of the two. Broadus and McNeile give a full discussion<br>
 of the various theories from a mere mechanical slip to the one<br>
 just given above. Matthew has here <b><i>(<!-#-->27:10)</i></b> "the field of the<br>
 potter" <b><i>(\eis ton agron tou kerame&#333;s\)</i></b> for "the potter the house<br>
 of the Lord" in <!-#-->Zec 11:13. That makes it more parallel with the<br>
 language of <!-#-->Mt 27:7.<br>
 <br>
 27:11 <B>{Now Jesus stood before the governor}</B> <b><i>(\ho de I&#275;sous<br>
 estath&#275; emprosthen tou h&#275;gemonos\)</i></b>. Here is one of the dramatic<br>
 episodes of history. Jesus stood face to face with the Roman<br>
 governor. The verb \estath&#275;\, not \est&#275;\ <b><i>(second aorist active)</i></b>,<br>
 is first aorist passive and can mean "was placed" there, but he<br>
 stood, not sat. The term \h&#275;gem&#333;n\ <b><i>(from \h&#275;geomai\, to lead)</i></b> was<br>
 technically a _legatus Caesaris_, an officer of the Emperor, more<br>
 exactly procurator, ruler under the Emperor of a less important<br>
 province than propraetor <b><i>(as over Syria)</i></b>. The senatorial<br>
 provinces like Achaia were governed by proconsuls. Pilate<br>
 represented Roman law. <B>{Art thou the King of the Jews?}</B> <b><i>(\Su ei<br>
 ho basileus t&#333;n Ioudai&#333;n;\)</i></b>. This is what really mattered.<br>
 Matthew does not give the charges made by the Sanhedrin <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 23:2)</i></b> nor the private interview with Pilate <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:28-32)</i></b>. He<br>
 could not ignore the accusation that Jesus claimed to be King of<br>
 the Jews. Else he could be himself accused to Caesar for<br>
 disloyalty. Rivals and pretenders were common all over the<br>
 empire. So here was one more. By his answer <b><i>(<B>{thou sayest}</B>)</i></b> Jesus<br>
 confesses that he is. So Pilate has a problem on his hands. What<br>
 sort of a king does this one claim to be? <B>{Thou}</B> <b><i>(\su\)</i></b> the King<br>
 of the Jews?<br>
 <br>
 27:14 <B>{And he gave him no answer, not even to one word}</B> <b><i>(\kai ouk<br>
 apekrith&#275; aut&#333;i pros oude hen rh&#275;ma\)</i></b>. Jesus refused to answer<br>
 the charges of the Jews <b><i>(verse <!-#-->12)</i></b>. Now he continued silent<br>
 under the direct question of Pilate. The Greek is very precise<br>
 besides the double negative. "He did not reply to him up to not<br>
 even one word." This silent dignity amazed Pilate and yet he was<br>
 strangely impressed.<br>
 <br>
 27:17 <B>{Barabbas or Jesus which is called Christ?}</B> <b><i>(\Barabb&#257;n &#275;<br>
 I&#275;soun ton legomenon Christon;\)</i></b>. Pilate was catching at straws<br>
 or seeking any loophole to escape condemning a harmless lunatic<br>
 or exponent of a superstitious cult such as he deemed Jesus to<br>
 be, certainly in no political sense a rival of Caesar. The Jews<br>
 interpreted "Christ" for Pilate to be a claim to be King of the<br>
 Jews in opposition to Caesar, "a most unprincipled proceeding"<br>
 <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. So he bethought him of the time-honoured custom at the<br>
 passover of releasing to the people "a prisoner whom they wished"<br>
 <b><i>(\desmion hon &#275;thelon\)</i></b>. No parallel case has been found, but<br>
 Josephus mentions the custom <b><i>(_Ant_. xx. 9,3)</i></b>. Barabbas was for<br>
 some reason a popular hero, a notable <b><i>(\epis&#275;mon\)</i></b>, if not<br>
 notorious, prisoner, leader of an insurrection or revolution <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 15:7)</i></b> probably against Rome, and so guilty of the very crime<br>
 that they tried to fasten on Jesus who only claimed to be king in<br>
 the spiritual sense of the spiritual kingdom. So Pilate<br>
 unwittingly pitted against each other two prisoners who<br>
 represented the antagonistic forces of all time. It is an<br>
 elliptical structure in the question, "whom do you wish that I<br>
 release?" <b><i>(\tina thelete apolus&#333;;\)</i></b>, either two questions in one<br>
 <b><i>(asyndeton)</i></b> or the ellipse of \hina\ before \apolus&#333;\. See the<br>
 same idiom in verse <!-#-->21. But Pilate's question tested the Jews<br>
 as well as himself. It tests all men today. Some manuscripts add<br>
 the name Jesus to Barabbas and that makes it all the sharper.<br>
 Jesus Barabbas or Jesus Christ?<br>
 <br>
 27:18 <B>{For envy}</B> <b><i>(\dia phthonon\)</i></b>. Pilate was dense about many<br>
 things, but he knew that the Jewish leaders were jealous of the<br>
 power of Jesus with the people. He may have heard of the events<br>
 of the Triumphal Entry and the Temple Teaching. The envy, of<br>
 course, came primarily from the leaders.<br>
 <br>
 27:19 <B>{His wife}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; gun&#275; autou\)</i></b>. Poor Pilate was getting more<br>
 entangled every moment as he hesitated to set Jesus free whom he<br>
 knew to be free of any crime against Caesar. Just at the moment<br>
 when he was trying to enlist the people in behalf of Jesus<br>
 against the schemes of the Jewish leaders, his wife sent a<br>
 message about her dream concerning Jesus. She calls Jesus "that<br>
 righteous man" <b><i>(\t&#333;i dikai&#333;i ekein&#333;i\)</i></b> and her psychical<br>
 sufferings increased Pilate's superstitious fears. Tradition<br>
 names her Procla and even calls her a Christian which is not<br>
 probable. But it was enough to unnerve the weak Pilate as he sat<br>
 on the judgment-seat <b><i>(\epi tou b&#275;matos\)</i></b> up over the pavement.<br>
 <br>
 27:20 <B>{Persuaded}</B> <b><i>(\epeisan\)</i></b>. The chief priests <b><i>(Sadducees)</i></b> and<br>
 elders <b><i>(Pharisees)</i></b> saw the peril of the situation and took no<br>
 chances. While Pilate wavered in pressing the question, they used<br>
 all their arts to get the people to "ask for themselves"<br>
 <b><i>(\ait&#275;s&#333;ntai\, indirect middle ingressive aorist subjunctive)</i></b> and<br>
 to choose Barabbas and not Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 27:22 <B>{What then shall I do unto Jesus which is called Christ?}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ti oun poi&#275;s&#333; I&#275;soun ton legomenon Christon;\)</i></b>. They had asked<br>
 for Barabbas under the tutelage of the Sanhedrin, but Pilate<br>
 pressed home the problem of Jesus with the dim hope that they<br>
 might ask for Jesus also. But they had learned their lesson. Some<br>
 of the very people who shouted "Hosannah" on the Sunday morning<br>
 of the Triumphal Entry now shout <B>{Let him be crucified}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\staur&#333;th&#275;t&#333;\)</i></b>. The tide has now turned against Jesus, the hero<br>
 of Sunday, now the condemned criminal of Friday. Such is popular<br>
 favour. But all the while Pilate is shirking his own fearful<br>
 responsibility and trying to hide his own weakness and injustice<br>
 behind popular clamour and prejudice.<br>
 <br>
 27:23 <B>{Why, what evil hath he done?}</B> <b><i>(\ti gar kakon epoi&#275;sen\;)</i></b>.<br>
 This was a feeble protest by a flickering conscience. Pilate<br>
 descended to that level of arguing with the mob now inflamed with<br>
 passion for the blood of Jesus, a veritable lynching fiasco. But<br>
 this exhibition of weakness made the mob fear refusal by Pilate<br>
 to proceed. So they "kept crying exceedingly" <b><i>(\periss&#333;s<br>
 ekrazon\, imperfect tense of repeated action and vehemently)</i></b><br>
 their demand for the crucifixion of Jesus. It was like a<br>
 gladiatorial show with all thumbs turned down.<br>
 <br>
 27:24 <B>{Washed his hands}</B> <b><i>(\apenipsato tas cheiras\)</i></b>. As a last<br>
 resort since the hubbub <b><i>(\thorubos\)</i></b> increased because of his<br>
 vacillation. The verb \aponipt&#333;\ means to wash off and the middle<br>
 voice means that he washed off his hands for himself as a common<br>
 symbol of cleanliness and added his pious claim with a slap at<br>
 them. <B>{I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man}</B> <b><i>(or<br>
 <B>{this blood}</B>)</i></b>; <B>{see ye to it}</B>. <b><i>(\Ath&#333;ios eimi apo tou haimatos<br>
 tou dikaiou toutou\ or \tou haimatos toutou\ as some manuscripts<br>
 have it, \humeis opsesthe\.)</i></b> The Jews used this symbol <b><i>(<!-#-->De 21:6;<br>
 Ps 26:6; 73:13)</i></b>. Plummer doubts if Pilate said these words with<br>
 a direct reference to his wife's message <b><i>(<!-#-->26:19)</i></b>, but I fail to<br>
 see the ground for that scepticism. The so-called _Gospel of<br>
 Peter_ says that Pilate washed his hands because the Jews refused<br>
 to do so.<br>
 <br>
 27:25 <B>{His blood be upon us and upon our children}</B> <b><i>(\to haima<br>
 autou kai epi ta tekna h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. These solemn words do show a<br>
 consciousness that the Jewish people recognized their guilt and<br>
 were even proud of it. But Pilate could not wash away his own<br>
 guilt that easily. The water did not wash away the blood of Jesus<br>
 from his hands any more than Lady Macbeth could wash away the<br>
 blood-stains from her lily-white hands. One legend tells that in<br>
 storms on Mt. Pilatus in Switzerland his ghost comes out and<br>
 still washes his hands in the storm-clouds. There was guilt<br>
 enough for Judas, for Caiaphas and for all the Sanhedrin both<br>
 Sadducees and Pharisees, for the Jewish people as a whole <b><i>(\pas<br>
 ho laos\)</i></b>, and for Pilate. At bottom the sins of all of us nailed<br>
 Jesus to the Cross. This language is no excuse for race hatred<br>
 today, but it helps explain the sensitiveness between Jew and<br>
 Christians on this subject. And Jews today approach the subject<br>
 of the Cross with a certain amount of prejudice.<br>
 <br>
 27:26 <B>{Scourged}</B> <b><i>(\phragell&#333;sas\)</i></b>. The Latin verb _flagellare_.<br>
 Pilate apparently lost interest in Jesus when he discovered that<br>
 he had no friends in the crowd. The religious leaders had been<br>
 eager to get Jesus condemned before many of the Galilean crowd<br>
 friendly to Jesus came into the city. They had apparently<br>
 succeeded. The scourging before the crucifixion was a brutal<br>
 Roman custom. The scourging was part of the capital punishment.<br>
 Deissmann <b><i>(_Light from the Ancient East_, p. 269)</i></b> quotes a<br>
 Florentine papyrus of the year 85 A.D. wherein G. Septimius<br>
 Vegetus, governor of Egypt, says of a certain Phibion: "Thou<br>
 hadst been worthy of scourging ... but I will give thee to the<br>
 people."<br>
 <br>
 27:27 <B>{Into the palace}</B> <b><i>(\eis to prait&#333;rion\)</i></b>. In Rome the<br>
 praetorium was the camp of the praetorian <b><i>(from praetor)</i></b> guard of<br>
 soldiers <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 1:13)</i></b>, but in the provinces it was the palace in<br>
 which the governor resided as in <!-#-->Ac 23:35 in Caesarea. So here<br>
 in Jerusalem Pilate ordered Jesus and all the band or cohort<br>
 <b><i>(\hol&#275;n t&#275;n speiran\)</i></b> of soldiers to be led into the palace in<br>
 front of which the judgment-seat had been placed. The Latin<br>
 _spira_ was anything rolled into a circle like a twisted ball of<br>
 thread. These Latin words are natural here in the atmosphere of<br>
 the court and the military environment. The soldiers were<br>
 gathered together for the sport of seeing the scourging. These<br>
 heathen soldiers would also enjoy showing their contempt for the<br>
 Jews as well as for the condemned man.<br>
 <br>
 27:28 <B>{A scarlet robe}</B> <b><i>(\chlamuda kokkin&#275;n\)</i></b>. A kind of short<br>
 cloak worn by soldiers, military officers, magistrates, kings,<br>
 emperors <b><i>(2Macc. 12:35; Josephus, _Ant_. V. 1,10)</i></b>, a soldier's<br>
 _sagum_ or scarf. Carr <b><i>(_Cambridge Gk. Test._)</i></b> suggests that it<br>
 may have been a worn-out scarf of Pilate's. The scarlet colour<br>
 <b><i>(\kokkin&#275;n\)</i></b> was a dye derived from the female insect <b><i>(\kermes\)</i></b><br>
 which gathered on the \ilex coccifera\ found in Palestine. These<br>
 dried clusters of insects look like berries and form the famous<br>
 dye. The word occurs in Plutarch, Epictetus, Herodas, and late<br>
 papyri besides the Septuagint and New Testament. Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 15:17)</i></b> has "purple" <b><i>(\porphuran\)</i></b>. There are various shades of<br>
 purple and scarlet and it is not easy to distinguish these<br>
 colours or tints. The manuscripts vary here between "stripped"<br>
 <b><i>(\ekdusantes\)</i></b> and "clothed" <b><i>(\endusantes\)</i></b>. He had been stripped<br>
 for the scourging. If "clothed" is correct, the soldiers added<br>
 the scarlet <b><i>(purple)</i></b> mantle. Herodotus <b><i>(iii. 139)</i></b> relates that<br>
 Darius richly rewarded a Samian exile for a rare scarlet robe<br>
 which he obtained from him. This scarlet mantle on Jesus was mock<br>
 imitation of the royal purple.<br>
 <br>
 27:29 <B>{A crown of thorns}</B> <b><i>(\stephanon ex akanth&#333;n\)</i></b>. They wove a<br>
 crown out of thorns which would grow even in the palace grounds.<br>
 It is immaterial whether they were young and tender thorn bushes,<br>
 as probable in the spring, or hard bushes with sharp prongs. The<br>
 soldiers would not care, for they were after ridicule and mockery<br>
 even if it caused pain. It was more like a victor's garland<br>
 <b><i>(\stephanon\)</i></b> than a royal diadem <b><i>(\diad&#275;ma\)</i></b>, but it served the<br>
 purpose. So with the reed <b><i>(\kalamon\)</i></b>, a stalk of common cane<br>
 grass which served as sceptre. The soldiers were familiar with<br>
 the _Ave Caesar_ and copy it in their mockery of Jesus: <B>{Hail,<br>
 King of the Jews}</B> <b><i>(\chaire, Basileu t&#333;n Ioudai&#333;n\)</i></b>. The soldiers<br>
 added the insults used by the Sanhedrin <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 26:67)</i></b>, spitting on<br>
 him and smiting him with the reed. Probably Jesus had been<br>
 unbound already. At any rate the garments of mockery were removed<br>
 before the _via dolorosa_ to the cross <b><i>(verse <!-#-->31)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 27:32 <B>{Compelled}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;ggareusan\)</i></b>. This word of Persian origin was<br>
 used in <!-#-->Mt 5:41, which see. There are numerous papyri examples<br>
 of Ptolemaic date and it survives in modern Greek vernacular. So<br>
 the soldiers treat Simon of Cyrene <b><i>(a town of Libya)</i></b> as a Persian<br>
 courier <b><i>(\aggaros\)</i></b> and impress him into service, probably<br>
 because Jesus was showing signs of physical weakness in bearing<br>
 his own Cross as the victims had to do, and not as a mere jest on<br>
 Simon. "Gethsemane, betrayal, the ordeal of the past sleepless<br>
 night, scourging, have made the flesh weak" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Yes, and the<br>
 burden of sin of the world that was breaking his heart. <B>{His<br>
 cross}</B> <b><i>(\ton stauron autou\)</i></b>. Jesus had used the term cross about<br>
 himself <b><i>(<!-#-->16:24)</i></b>. It was a familiar enough picture under Roman<br>
 rule. Jesus had long foreseen and foretold this horrible form of<br>
 death for himself <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 20:19; 23:24; 26:2)</i></b>. He had heard the cry<br>
 of the mob to Pilate that he be crucified <b><i>(<!-#-->27:22)</i></b> and Pilate's<br>
 surrender <b><i>(<!-#-->27:26)</i></b> and he was on the way to the Cross <b><i>(<!-#-->27:31)</i></b>.<br>
 There were various kinds of crosses and we do not know precisely<br>
 the shape of the Cross on which Jesus was crucified, though<br>
 probably the one usually presented is correct. Usually the victim<br>
 was nailed <b><i>(hands and feet)</i></b> to the cross before it was raised and<br>
 it was not very high. The crucifixion was done by the soldiers<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->27:35)</i></b> in charge and two robbers were crucified on each side<br>
 of Jesus, three crosses standing in a row <b><i>(<!-#-->27:38)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 27:33 <B>{Golgotha}</B> <b><i>(\Golgotha\)</i></b>. Chaldaic or Aramaic _Gulgatha_,<br>
 Hebrew _Gulgoleth_, place of a skull-shaped mount, not place of<br>
 skulls. Latin Vulgate _Calvariae locus_, hence our Calvary.<br>
 Tyndale misunderstood it as a place of dead men's skulls. Calvary<br>
 or Golgotha is not the traditional place of the Holy Sepulchre in<br>
 Jerusalem, but a place outside of the city, probably what is now<br>
 called Gordon's Calvary, a hill north of the city wall which from<br>
 the Mount of Olives looks like a skull, the rock-hewn tombs<br>
 resembling eyes in one of which Jesus may have been buried.<br>
 <br>
 27:34 <B>{Wine mingled with gall}</B> <b><i>(\oinon meta chol&#275;s memigmenon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Late MSS. read <B>{vinegar}</B> <b><i>(\oxos\)</i></b> instead of wine and Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 15:23)</i></b> has myrrh instead of gall. The myrrh gave the sour wine a<br>
 better flavour and like the bitter gall had a narcotic and<br>
 stupefying effect. Both elements may have been in the drink which<br>
 Jesus tasted and refused to drink. Women provided the drink to<br>
 deaden the sense of pain and the soldiers may have added the gall<br>
 to make it disagreeable. Jesus desired to drink to the full the<br>
 cup from his Father's hand <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:11)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 27:36 <B>{Watched him there}</B> <b><i>(\et&#275;roun auton ekei\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense<br>
 descriptive of the task to prevent the possibility of rescue or<br>
 removal of the body. These rough Roman soldiers casting lots over<br>
 the garments of Christ give a picture of comedy at the foot of<br>
 the Cross, the tragedy of the ages.<br>
 <br>
 27:37 <B>{His accusation}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n aitian autou\)</i></b>. The title <b><i>(\titlos\,<br>
 <!-#-->Joh 19:19)</i></b> or placard of the crime <b><i>(the inscription, \he<br>
 epigraph&#275;\)</i></b> which was carried before the victim or hung around<br>
 his neck as he walked to execution was now placed above <b><i>(\ep'<br>
 an&#333;\)</i></b> the head of Jesus on the projecting piece <b><i>(\crux immurus\)</i></b>.<br>
 This inscription gave the name and home, <B>{Jesus of Nazareth}</B>, and<br>
 the charge on which he was convicted, <B>{the King of the Jews}</B> and<br>
 the identification, <B>{This is}</B>. The four reports all give the<br>
 charge and vary in the others. The inscription in full was: This<br>
 is Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews. The three languages<br>
 are mentioned only by John <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:20)</i></b>, Latin for law, Hebrew<br>
 <b><i>(Aramaic)</i></b> for the Jews, Greek for everybody. The accusation<br>
 <b><i>(charge, cause, \aitia\)</i></b> correctly told the facts of the<br>
 condemnation.<br>
 <br>
 27:38 <B>{Robbers}</B> <b><i>(\l&#275;istai\)</i></b>. Not thieves <b><i>(\kleptai\)</i></b> as in<br>
 Authorized Version. See <!-#-->Mt 26:55. These two robbers were<br>
 probably members of the band of Barabbas on whose cross Jesus now<br>
 hung.<br>
 <br>
 27:39 <B>{Wagging their heads}</B> <b><i>(\kinountes tas kephalas aut&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Probably in mock commiseration. "Jews again appear on the scene,<br>
 with a malice like that shewn in the trial before the Sanhedrin"<br>
 <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. "To us it may seem incredible that even his worst<br>
 enemies could be guilty of anything so brutal as to hurl taunts<br>
 at one suffering the agonies of crucifixion" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. These<br>
 passers-by <b><i>(\parat&#275;roumenoi\)</i></b> look on Jesus as one now down and<br>
 out. They jeer at the fallen foe.<br>
 <br>
 27:40 <B>{If thou art the Son of God}</B> <b><i>(\ei huios ei tou theou\)</i></b>.<br>
 More exactly, "If thou art a son of God," the very language of<br>
 the devil to Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 4:3)</i></b> in the early temptations, now<br>
 hurled at Jesus under the devil's prompting as he hung upon the<br>
 Cross. There is allusion, of course, to the claim of Jesus under<br>
 oath before the Sanhedrin "the Son of God" <b><i>(\ho huios tou theou\)</i></b><br>
 and a repetition of the misrepresentation of his words about the<br>
 temple of his body. It is a pitiful picture of human depravity<br>
 and failure in the presence of Christ dying for sinners.<br>
 <br>
 27:41 <B>{The chief priests mocking}</B> <b><i>(\hoi archiereis empaizontes\)</i></b>.<br>
 The Sanhedrin in fact, for "the scribes and elders" are included.<br>
 The word for mocking <b><i>(\empaizontes, en,\ and \paiz&#333;\, from<br>
 \pais\, child)</i></b> means acting like silly children who love to guy<br>
 one another. These grave and reverend seniors had already given<br>
 vent to their glee at the condemnation of Jesus by themselves<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 26:67f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 27:42 <B>{He saved others; himself he cannot save}</B> <b><i>(\allous es&#333;sen;<br>
 heauton ou dunatai s&#333;sai\)</i></b>. The sarcasm is true, though they do<br>
 not know its full significance. If he had saved himself now, he<br>
 could not have saved any one. The paradox is precisely the<br>
 philosophy of life proclaimed by Jesus himself <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:39)</i></b>. <B>{Let<br>
 him now come down}</B> <b><i>(\katabat&#333; nun\)</i></b>. Now that he is a condemned<br>
 criminal nailed to the Cross with the claim of being "the King of<br>
 Israel" <b><i>(the Jews)</i></b> over his head. Their spiteful assertion that<br>
 they would then believe upon Jesus <b><i>(\ep' auton\)</i></b> is plainly<br>
 untrue. They would have shifted their ground and invented some<br>
 other excuse. When Jesus wrought his greatest miracles, they<br>
 wanted "a sign from heaven." These "pious scoffers" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b> are<br>
 like many today who make factitious and arbitrary demands of<br>
 Christ whose character and power and deity are plain to all whose<br>
 eyes are not blinded by the god of this world. Christ will not<br>
 give new proofs to the blind in heart.<br>
 <br>
 27:43 <B>{Let him deliver him now}</B> <b><i>(\rhusasth&#333; nun\)</i></b>. They add the<br>
 word "now" to <!-#-->Ps 21; 22:8. That is the point of the sneer at<br>
 Christ's claim to be God's son thrown in his teeth again and at<br>
 the willingness and power of God to help his "son." The verb<br>
 \thel&#333;\ here may mean <B>{love}</B> as in the Septuagint <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps 18:20;<br>
 41:12)</i></b> or "cares for" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>, "gin he cares ocht for him"<br>
 <b><i>(_Braid Scots_)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 27:44 <B>{The robbers also}</B> <b><i>(\kai hoi l&#275;istai\)</i></b>. Probably "even the<br>
 robbers" <b><i>(Weymouth)</i></b> who felt a momentary superiority to Jesus<br>
 thus maligned by all. So the inchoative imperfect \&#333;neidizon\<br>
 means "began to reproach him."<br>
 <br>
 27:45 <B>{From the sixth hour}</B> <b><i>(\apo hekt&#275;s h&#333;ras\)</i></b>. Curiously<br>
 enough McNeile takes this to mean the trial before Pilate <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 18:14)</i></b>. But clearly John uses Roman time, writing at the close<br>
 of the century when Jewish time was no longer in vogue. It was<br>
 six o'clock in the morning Roman time when the trial occurred<br>
 before Pilate. The crucifixion began at the third hour <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 15:25)</i></b> Jewish time or nine A.M. The darkness began at noon, the<br>
 sixth hour Jewish time and lasted till 3 P.M. Roman time, the<br>
 ninth hour Jewish time <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 15:33; Mt 27:45; Lu 23:44)</i></b>. The<br>
 dense darkness for three hours could not be an eclipse of the sun<br>
 and Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:45)</i></b> does not so say, only "the sun's light<br>
 failing." Darkness sometimes precedes earthquakes and one came at<br>
 this time or dense masses of clouds may have obscured the sun's<br>
 light. One need not be disturbed if nature showed its sympathy<br>
 with the tragedy of the dying of the Creator on the Cross <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro<br>
 8:22)</i></b>, groaning and travailing until now.<br>
 <br>
 27:46 <B>{My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?}</B> <b><i>(\Thee mou,<br>
 thee mou, hina ti me egkatelipes;\)</i></b>. Matthew first transliterates<br>
 the Aramaic, according to the Vatican manuscript <b><i>(B)</i></b>, the words<br>
 used by Jesus: _El&#333;i, el&#333;i, lema sabachthanei_; Some of the MSS.<br>
 give the transliteration of these words from <!-#-->Ps 22:1 in the<br>
 Hebrew <b><i>(_Eli, Eli, lama Zaphthanei_)</i></b>. This is the only one of the<br>
 seven sayings of Christ on the Cross given by Mark and Matthew.<br>
 The other six occur in Luke and John. This is the only sentence<br>
 of any length in Aramaic preserved in Matthew, though he has<br>
 Aramaic words like amen, corban, mammon, pascha, raca, Satan,<br>
 Golgotha. The so-called Gospel of Peter preserves this saying in<br>
 a Docetic <b><i>(Cerinthian)</i></b> form: "My power, my power, thou hast<br>
 forsaken me!" The Cerinthian Gnostics held that the _aeon_ Christ<br>
 came on the man Jesus at his baptism and left him here on the<br>
 Cross so that only the man Jesus died. Nothing from Jesus so well<br>
 illustrates the depth of his suffering of soul as he felt himself<br>
 regarded as sin though sinless <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 5:21)</i></b>. <!-#-->Joh 3:16 comes to<br>
 our relief here as we see the Son of God bearing the sin of the<br>
 world. This cry of desolation comes at the close of the three<br>
 hours of darkness.<br>
 <br>
 27:48 <B>{Gave him to drink}</B> <b><i>(\epotizen\)</i></b>. Imperfect of conative<br>
 action, <B>{offered him a drink}</B> of vinegar on the sponge on a reed.<br>
 Others interrupted this kindly man, but Jesus did taste this mild<br>
 stimulant <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:30)</i></b> for he thirsted <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:28)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 27:49 <B>{Whether Elijah cometh to save him}</B> <b><i>(\ei erchetai Eleias<br>
 s&#333;s&#333;n auton\)</i></b>. The excuse had a pious sound as they misunderstood<br>
 the words of Jesus in his outcry of soul anguish. We have here<br>
 one of the rare instances <b><i>(\s&#333;s&#333;n\)</i></b> of the future participle to<br>
 express purpose in the N.T. though a common Greek idiom. Some<br>
 ancient MSS. add here what is genuine in <!-#-->Joh 19:34, but what<br>
 makes complete wreck of the context for in verse <!-#-->50 Jesus cried<br>
 with a loud voice and was not yet dead in verse <!-#-->49. It was a<br>
 crass mechanical copying by some scribe from <!-#-->Joh 19:34. See<br>
 full discussion in my _Introduction to the Textual Criticism of<br>
 the N.T._<br>
 <br>
 27:50 <B>{Yielded up his spirit}</B> <b><i>(\aph&#275;ken to pneuma\)</i></b>. The loud cry<br>
 may have been <!-#-->Ps 31:5 as given in <!-#-->Lu 23:46: "Father, into thy<br>
 hands I commend my spirit." John <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:30)</i></b> gives <B>{It is<br>
 finished}</B> <b><i>(\tetelestai\)</i></b>, though which was actually last is not<br>
 clear. Jesus did not die from slow exhaustion, but with a loud<br>
 cry. <B>{He breathed out}</B> <b><i>(\exepneusen\, <!-#-->Mr 15:37)</i></b>, <B>{sent back his<br>
 spirit}</B> <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:50)</i></b>, <B>{gave up his spirit}</B> <b><i>(\pared&#333;ken to<br>
 pneuma\, <!-#-->Joh 19:30)</i></b>. "He gave up his life because he willed it,<br>
 when he willed it, and as he willed it" <b><i>(Augustine)</i></b>. Stroud<br>
 <b><i>(_Physical Cause of the Death of Christ_)</i></b> considers the loud cry<br>
 one of the proofs that Jesus died of a ruptured heart as a result<br>
 of bearing the sin of the world.<br>
 <br>
 27:51 <B>{Was rent}</B> <b><i>(\eschisth&#275;\)</i></b>. Both Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 15:38)</i></b> and Luke<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:45)</i></b> mention also this fact. Matthew connects it with the<br>
 earthquake, "the earth did quake" <b><i>(\h&#275; g&#275; eseisth&#275;\)</i></b>. Josephus<br>
 <b><i>(_War_ VI. 299)</i></b> tells of a quaking in the temple before the<br>
 destruction and the Talmud tells of a quaking forty years before<br>
 the destruction of the temple. Allen suggests that "a cleavage in<br>
 the masonry of the porch, which rent the outer veil and left the<br>
 Holy Place open to view, would account for the language of the<br>
 Gospels, of Josephus, and of the Talmud." This veil was a most<br>
 elaborately woven fabric of seventy-two twisted plaits of<br>
 twenty-four threads each and the veil was sixty feet long and<br>
 thirty wide. The rending of the veil signified the removal of the<br>
 separation between God and the people <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 27:52 <B>{The tombs were opened}</B> <b><i>(\ta mn&#275;meia ane&#333;ichth&#275;san\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive indicative <b><i>(double augment)</i></b>. The splitting of the<br>
 rocks by the earthquake and the opening of tombs can be due to<br>
 the earthquake. But the raising of the bodies of the dead after<br>
 the resurrection of Jesus which appeared to many in the holy city<br>
 puzzles many today who admit the actual bodily resurrection of<br>
 Jesus. Some would brand all these portents as legends since they<br>
 appear in Matthew alone. Others would say that "after his<br>
 resurrection" should read "after their resurrection," but that<br>
 would make it conflict with Paul's description of Christ as the<br>
 first fruits of them that sleep <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:20)</i></b>. Some say that<br>
 Jesus released these spirits after his descent into Hades. So it<br>
 goes. We come back to miracles connected with the birth of Jesus,<br>
 God's Son coming into the world. If we grant the possibility of<br>
 such manifestations of God's power, there is little to disturb<br>
 one here in the story of the death of God's Son.<br>
 <br>
 27:54 <B>{Truly this was the Son of God}</B> <b><i>(\al&#275;th&#333;s theou huios &#275;n<br>
 houtos\)</i></b>. There is no article with God or Son in the Greek so<br>
 that it means "God's Son," either "the Son of God" or "a Son of<br>
 God." There is no way to tell. Evidently the centurion<br>
 <b><i>(\hekatontarchos\ here, ruler of a hundred, Latin word<br>
 _kenturi&#333;n_ in <!-#-->Mr 15:39)</i></b> was deeply moved by the portents which<br>
 he had witnessed. He had heard the several flings at Jesus for<br>
 claiming to be the Son of God and may even have heard of his<br>
 claim before the Sanhedrin and Pilate. How much he meant by his<br>
 words we do not know, but probably he meant more than merely "a<br>
 righteous man" <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:47)</i></b>. Petronius is the name given this<br>
 centurion by tradition. If he was won now to trust in Christ, he<br>
 came as a pagan and, like the robber who believed, was saved as<br>
 Jesus hung upon the Cross. All who are ever saved in truth are<br>
 saved because of the death of Jesus on the Cross. So the Cross<br>
 began to do its work at once.<br>
 <br>
 27:55 <B>{Many women}</B> <b><i>(\gunaikes pollai\)</i></b>. We have come to expect<br>
 the women from Galilee to be faithful, last at the Cross and<br>
 first at the tomb. Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:49)</i></b> says that "all his<br>
 acquaintance" <b><i>(\pantes hoi gn&#333;stoi aut&#333;i\)</i></b> stood at a distance<br>
 and saw the end. One may hope that the apostles were in that sad<br>
 group. But certainly many women were there. The Mother of Jesus<br>
 had been taken away from the side of the Cross by the Beloved<br>
 Disciple to his own home <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:27)</i></b>. Matthew names three of<br>
 the group by name. Mary Magdalene is mentioned as a well-known<br>
 person though not previously named in Matthew's Gospel. Certainly<br>
 she is not the sinful woman of <!-#-->Lu 7 nor Mary of Bethany. There<br>
 is another Mary, the mother of James and Joseph <b><i>(Joses)</i></b> not<br>
 otherwise known to us. And then there is the mother of the sons<br>
 of Zebedee <b><i>(James and John)</i></b>, usually identified with Salome <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 15:40)</i></b>. These noble and faithful women were "beholding from<br>
 afar" <b><i>(\apo makrothen the&#333;rousai\)</i></b>. These three women may have<br>
 drawn nearer to the Cross for Mary the Mother of Jesus stood<br>
 beside the Cross <b><i>(\para t&#333;i staur&#333;i\)</i></b> with Mary of Clopas and<br>
 Mary Magdalene <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:25)</i></b> before she left. They had once<br>
 ministered unto Jesus <b><i>(\diakonousai aut&#333;i\)</i></b> and now he is dead.<br>
 Matthew does not try to picture the anguish of heart of these<br>
 noble women nor does he say as Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:48)</i></b> does that "they<br>
 returned smiting their breasts." He drops the curtain on that<br>
 saddest of all tragedies as the loyal band stood and looked at<br>
 the dead Christ on Golgotha. What hope did life now hold for<br>
 them?<br>
 <br>
 27:57 <B>{And when even was come}</B> <b><i>(\opsias de genomen&#275;s\)</i></b>. It was<br>
 the Preparation <b><i>(\paraskeu&#275;\)</i></b>, the day before the sabbath <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 15:42; Lu 23:54; Joh 31:42)</i></b>. \Paraskeu&#275;\ is the name in modern<br>
 Greek today for Friday. The Jews were anxious that these bodies<br>
 should be taken down before the sabbath began at 6 P.M. The<br>
 request of Joseph of Arimathea for the body of Jesus was a relief<br>
 to Pilate and to the Jews also. We know little about this member<br>
 of the Sanhedrin save his name Joseph, his town Arimathea, that<br>
 he was rich, a secret disciple, and had not agreed to the death<br>
 of Jesus. Probably he now wished that he had made an open<br>
 profession. But he has courage now when others are cowardly and<br>
 asked for the personal privilege <b><i>(\&#275;it&#275;sato\, middle voice, asked<br>
 for himself)</i></b> of placing the body of Jesus in his new tomb. Some<br>
 today identify this tomb with one of the rock tombs now visible<br>
 under Gordon's Calvary. It was a mournful privilege and dignity<br>
 that came to Joseph and Nicodemus <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:39-41)</i></b> as they<br>
 wrapped the body of Jesus in clean linen cloth and with proper<br>
 spices placed it in this fresh <b><i>(\kain&#333;i\)</i></b> tomb in which no body<br>
 had yet been placed. It was cut in the rock <b><i>(\elatom&#275;sen\)</i></b> for<br>
 his own body, but now it was for Jesus. But now <b><i>(verse <!-#-->60)</i></b> he<br>
 rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and departed. That<br>
 was for safety. But two women had watched the sad and lonely<br>
 ceremony, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary <b><i>(mother of James and<br>
 Joseph)</i></b>. They were sitting opposite and looking in silence.<br>
 <br>
 27:63 <B>{Sir, we remember}</B> <b><i>(\kurie, emnesth&#275;men\)</i></b>. This was the<br>
 next day, on our Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, the day after the<br>
 Preparation <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:62)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist indicative, we have<br>
 just recalled. It is objected that the Jewish rulers would know<br>
 nothing of such a prediction, but in <!-#-->Mt 12:40 he expressly made<br>
 it to them. Meyer scouts as unhistorical legend the whole story<br>
 that Christ definitely foretold his resurrection on the third<br>
 day. But that is to make legendary much of the Gospels and to<br>
 limit Jesus to a mere man. The problem remains why the disciples<br>
 forgot and the Jewish leaders remembered. But that is probably<br>
 due on the one hand to the overwhelming grief of the disciples<br>
 coupled with the blighting of all their hopes of a political<br>
 Messiah in Jesus, and on the other hand to the keen nervous fear<br>
 of the leaders who dreaded the power of Jesus though dead. They<br>
 wanted to make sure of their victory and prevent any possible<br>
 revival of this pernicious heresy. <B>{That deceiver}</B> <b><i>(\ekeinos ho<br>
 planos\)</i></b> they call him, a vagabond wanderer <b><i>(\planos\)</i></b> with a<br>
 slur in the use of <B>{that}</B> <b><i>(\ekeinos\)</i></b>, a picturesque sidelight on<br>
 their intense hatred of and fear of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 27:64 <B>{The last error}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; eschat&#275; plan&#275;\)</i></b>. The last delusion,<br>
 imposture <b><i>(Weymouth)</i></b>, fraud <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>. Latin _error_ is used in<br>
 both senses, from _errare_, to go astray. The first fraud was<br>
 belief in the Messiahship of Jesus, the second belief in his<br>
 resurrection.<br>
 <br>
 27:65 <B>{Make it as sure as you can}</B> <b><i>(\asphalisasthe h&#333;s oidate\)</i></b>.<br>
 "Make it secure for yourselves <b><i>(ingressive aorist middle)</i></b> as you<br>
 know how." <B>{Have a guard}</B> <b><i>(\echete koust&#333;dian\)</i></b>, present<br>
 imperative, a guard of Roman soldiers, not mere temple police.<br>
 The Latin term _koust&#333;dia_ occurs in an Oxyrhynchus papyrus of<br>
 A.D. 22. "The curt permission to the Jews whom he despised is<br>
 suitable in the mouth of the Roman official" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 27:66 <B>{Sealing the stone, the guard being with them}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sphragisant&#275;s ton lithon meta t&#275;s koust&#333;dias\)</i></b>. Probably by a<br>
 cord stretched across the stone and sealed at each end as in <!-#-->Da<br>
 6:17. The sealing was done in the presence of the Roman guard<br>
 who were left in charge to protect this stamp of Roman authority<br>
 and power. They did their best to prevent theft and the<br>
 resurrection <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>, but they overreached themselves and<br>
 provided additional witness to the fact of the empty tomb and the<br>
 resurrection of Jesus <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
