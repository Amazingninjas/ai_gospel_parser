</TD></TR></TABLE>
 <HR>
<p>1:1 _The Title_ is simply _Acts_ <b><i>(\Praxeis\)</i></b> in Aleph, Origen,<br>
 Tertullian, Didymus, Hilary, Eusebius, Epiphanius. _The Acts of<br>
 the Apostles_ <b><i>(\Praxeis apostol&#333;n\)</i></b> is the reading of B D <b><i>(Aleph<br>
 in subscription)</i></b> Athanasius, Origen, Tertullian, Cyprian,<br>
 Eusebius, Cyril of Jerusalem, Theodoret, Hilary. _The Acts of the<br>
 Holy Apostles_ <b><i>(\Praxeis t&#333;n hagi&#333;n apostol&#333;n\)</i></b> is read by A2 E G<br>
 H A K Chrysostom. It is possible that the book was given no title<br>
 at all by Luke, for it is plain that usage varied greatly even in<br>
 the same writers. The long title as found in the Textus Receptus<br>
 <b><i>(Authorized Version)</i></b> is undoubtedly wrong with the adjective<br>
 "Holy." The reading of B D, "_The Acts of the Apostles_," may be<br>
 accepted as probably correct.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{The former treatise}</B> <b><i>(\ton men pr&#333;ton\)</i></b>. Literally, the first<br>
 treatise. The use of the superlative is common enough and by no<br>
 means implies, though it allows, a third volume. This use of<br>
 \pr&#333;tos\ where only two are compared is seen between the Baptist<br>
 and Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:15)</i></b>, John and Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 20:4)</i></b>. The idiom is<br>
 common in the papyri <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 662, 669)</i></b>. The<br>
 use of \men solitarium\ here, as Hackett notes, is common in<br>
 Acts. It is by no means true that \men\ requires a following \de\<br>
 by contrast. The word is merely a weakened form of \m&#275;n\=surely,<br>
 indeed. The reference is to the "first treatise" and merely<br>
 emphasizes that. The use of \logos\ <b><i>(word)</i></b> for treatise or<br>
 historical narrative is common in ancient Greek as in Herodotus 6<br>
 and 9. Plato <b><i>(_Phaedo_, p. 61 B)</i></b> makes a contrast between<br>
 \muthos\ and \logos\. <B>{I made}</B> <b><i>(\epoi&#275;sam&#275;n\)</i></b>. Aorist middle<br>
 indicative, the middle being the usual construction for mental<br>
 acts with \poie&#333;\. <B>{O Theophilus}</B> <b><i>(\O Theophile\)</i></b>. The<br>
 interjection \O\ here as is common, though not in <!-#-->Lu 1:3. But<br>
 the adjective \kratiste\ <b><i>(most excellent)</i></b> is wanting here. See<br>
 remarks on Theophilus on &#175;Lu 1:3. Hackett thinks that he lived<br>
 at Rome because of the way Acts ends. He was a man of rank. He<br>
 may have defrayed the expense of publishing both Luke and Acts.<br>
 Perhaps by this time Luke may have reached a less ceremonious<br>
 acquaintance with Theophilus. <B>{Which Jesus began}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;n &#275;rxato<br>
 I&#275;sous\)</i></b>. The relative is attracted from the accusative \ha\ to<br>
 the genitive \h&#333;n\ because of the antecedent \pant&#333;n\ <b><i>(all)</i></b>. The<br>
 language of Luke here is not merely pleonastic as Winer held.<br>
 Jesus "began" "both to do and to teach" <b><i>(\poiein te kai<br>
 didaskein\)</i></b>. Note present infinitives, linear action, still going<br>
 on, and the use of \te--kai\ binds together the life and<br>
 teachings of Jesus, as if to say that Jesus is still carrying on<br>
 from heaven the work and teaching of the disciples which he<br>
 started while on earth before his ascension. The record which<br>
 Luke now records is really the Acts of Jesus as much as the Acts<br>
 of the Apostles. Dr. A. T. Pierson called it "The Acts of the<br>
 Holy Spirit," and that is true also. The Acts, according to Luke,<br>
 is a continuation of the doings and teachings of Jesus. "The<br>
 following writings appear intended to give us, and do, in fact,<br>
 profess to give us, that which Jesus _continued_ to do and teach<br>
 after the day in which he was taken up" <b><i>(Bernard, _Progress of<br>
 Doctrine in the N.T._)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:2 <B>{Until the day in which}</B> <b><i>(\achri h&#275;s h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. Incorporation<br>
 of the antecedent into the relative clause and the change of case<br>
 \h&#275;i\ <b><i>(locative)</i></b> to \h&#275;s\ <b><i>(genitive)</i></b>. <B>{Was received up}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anel&#275;mpth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of \analamban&#333;\.<br>
 Common verb to lift anything up <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10:16)</i></b> or person as Paul<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:13)</i></b>. Several times of the Ascension of Jesus to heaven<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 16:19; Ac 1:2,11,22; 1Ti 3:16)</i></b> with or without "into<br>
 heaven" <b><i>(\eis ton ouranon\)</i></b>. This same verb is used of Elijah's<br>
 translation to heaven in the LXX <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ki 2:11)</i></b>. The same idea,<br>
 though not this word, is in <!-#-->Lu 24:51. See <!-#-->Lu 9:51 for<br>
 \anal&#275;mpsis\ of the Ascension. <B>{Had given commandment}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\enteilamenos\)</i></b>. First aorist middle participle of \entell&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(from \en\ and \tell&#333;\, to accomplish)</i></b>, usually in the middle,<br>
 old verb, to enjoin. This special commandment refers directly to<br>
 what we call the commission given the apostles before Christ<br>
 ascended on high <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 20:21-23; Mt 28:16-20; Mr 16:15-18; 1Co<br>
 15:6; Lu 24:44-49)</i></b>. He had given commands to them when they were<br>
 first chosen and when they were sent out on the tour of Galilee,<br>
 but the immediate reference is as above. <B>{Through the Holy<br>
 Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\dia pneumatos hagiou\)</i></b>. In his human life Jesus was<br>
 under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This applies to the choice<br>
 of the apostles <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:13)</i></b> and to these special commands before<br>
 the Ascension. <B>{Whom he had chosen}</B> <b><i>(\hous exelexato\)</i></b>. Aorist<br>
 middle indicative, not past perfect. The same verb<br>
 <b><i>(\eklexamenos\)</i></b> was used by Luke in describing the choice of the<br>
 twelve by Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:13)</i></b>. But the aorist does not stand "for"<br>
 our English pluperfect as Hackett says. That is explaining Greek<br>
 by English. The Western text here adds: "And ordered to proclaim<br>
 the gospel."<br>
 <br>
 1:3 <B>{To whom also}</B> <b><i>(\hois kai\)</i></b>. He chose them and then also<br>
 manifested himself to these very same men that they might have<br>
 personal witness to give. <B>{Shewed himself alive}</B> <b><i>(\parest&#275;sen<br>
 heauton z&#333;nta\)</i></b>. To the disciples the first Sunday evening <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 16:14; Lu 24:36-43; Joh 20:19-25)</i></b>, the second Sunday evening<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 20:26-29)</i></b>, at the Sea of Tiberias <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 21:1-23)</i></b>, on the<br>
 mountain in Galilee <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 28:16-20; Mr 16:15-18; 1Co 15:6)</i></b>, to<br>
 the disciples in Jerusalem and Olivet <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:44-53; Mr 16-19f.;<br>
 Ac 1:1-11)</i></b>. Luke uses this verb \parist&#275;mi\ 13 times in the Acts<br>
 both transitively and intransitively. It is rendered by various<br>
 English words <b><i>(present, furnish, provide, assist, commend)</i></b>. The<br>
 early disciples including Paul never doubted the fact of the<br>
 Resurrection, once they were convinced by personal experience. At<br>
 first some doubted like Thomas <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 16:14; Lu 24:41; Joh 20:24f.;<br>
 Mt 28:17)</i></b>. But after that they never wavered in their testimony<br>
 to their own experience with the Risen Christ, "whereof we are<br>
 witnesses" Peter said <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 3:15)</i></b>. They doubted at first, that we<br>
 may believe, but at last they risked life itself in defence of<br>
 this firm faith. <B>{After his passion}</B> <b><i>(\meta to pathein auton\)</i></b>.<br>
 Neat Greek idiom, \meta\ with the articular infinitive <b><i>(second<br>
 aorist active of \pasch&#333;\)</i></b> and the accusative of general<br>
 reference, "after the suffering as to him." For \pathein\ used<br>
 absolutely of Christ's suffering see also <!-#-->Ac 17:3; 26:23. <B>{By<br>
 many proofs}</B> <b><i>(\en pollois tekm&#275;riois\)</i></b>. Literally, "in many<br>
 proofs." \Tekm&#275;rion\ is only here in the N.T., though an old and<br>
 common word in ancient Greek and occurring in the _Koin&#275;_<br>
 <b><i>(papyri, etc.)</i></b>. The verb \tekmair&#333;\, to prove by sure signs, is<br>
 from \tekmar\, a sign. Luke does not hesitate to apply the<br>
 definite word "proofs" to the evidence for the Resurrection of<br>
 Christ after full investigation on the part of this scientific<br>
 historian. Aristotle makes a distinction between \tekm&#275;rion\<br>
 <b><i>(proof)</i></b> and \s&#275;meion\ <b><i>(sign)</i></b> as does Galen the medical writer.<br>
 <B>{Appearing}</B> <b><i>(\optanomenos\)</i></b>. Present middle participle from late<br>
 verb \optan&#333;\, late _Koin&#275;_ verb from root \opt&#333;\ seen in<br>
 \opsomai, &#333;phth&#275;n\. In LXX, papyri of second century B.C.<br>
 <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient East_, p. 83)</i></b>. Only here in<br>
 the N.T. For \optasia\ for vision see <!-#-->Ac 26:19; Lu 1:22; 24:23.<br>
 <B>{By the space of forty days}</B> <b><i>(\di' h&#275;mer&#333;n tesserakonta\)</i></b>. At<br>
 intervals <b><i>(\dia\, between)</i></b> during the forty days, ten appearances<br>
 being known to us. Jesus was not with them continually now in<br>
 bodily presence. The period of forty days is given here alone.<br>
 The Ascension was thus ten days before Pentecost when the Holy<br>
 Spirit came. Moses was in the mount forty days <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 24:18)</i></b> and<br>
 Jesus fasted forty days <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 4:2)</i></b>. In the Gospel of Luke 24 this<br>
 separation of forty days between the Resurrection and the<br>
 Ascension is not drawn. <B>{The things concerning the Kingdom of<br>
 God}</B> <b><i>(\ta peri t&#275;s basileias tou theou\)</i></b>. This phrase appears 33<br>
 times in Luke's Gospel, 15 times in Mark, 4 times in Matthew who<br>
 elsewhere has "the kingdom of heaven," once in John, and 6 times<br>
 in Acts. No essential distinction is to be drawn between the two<br>
 for the Jews often used "heaven" rather than "God" to avoid using<br>
 the Tetragrammaton. But it is noticeable how the word kingdom<br>
 drops out of Acts. Other words like gospel <b><i>(\euaggelion\)</i></b> take<br>
 the place of "kingdom." Jesus was fond of the word "kingdom" and<br>
 Luke is fond of the idiom "the things concerning" <b><i>(\ta peri\)</i></b>.<br>
 Certainly with Jesus the term "kingdom" applies to the present<br>
 and the future and covers so much that it is not strange that the<br>
 disciples with their notions of a political Messianic kingdom<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 1:6)</i></b> were slow to comprehend the spiritual nature of the<br>
 reign of God.<br>
 <br>
 1:4 <B>{Being assembled together with them}</B> <b><i>(\sunalizomenos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present passive participle from \sunaliz&#333;\, an old verb in<br>
 Herodotus, Xenophon, etc., from sun, with, and \haliz&#333;\, from<br>
 \hal&#275;s\, crowded. The margin of both the Authorized and the<br>
 Revised Versions has "eating with them" as if from \sun\ and<br>
 \hals\ <b><i>(salt)</i></b>. Salt was the mark of hospitality. There is the<br>
 verb \halisth&#275;te en aut&#333;i\ used by Ignatius _Ad Magnes_. X, "Be<br>
 ye salted in him." But it is more than doubtful if that is the<br>
 idea here though the Vulgate does have _convescens illis_ "eating<br>
 with them," as if that was the common habit of Jesus during the<br>
 forty days <b><i>(Wendt, Feine, etc.)</i></b>. Jesus did on occasion eat with<br>
 the disciples <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:41-43; Mr 16:14)</i></b>. <B>{To wait for the promise<br>
 of the Father}</B> <b><i>(\perimenein t&#275;n epaggelian tou patros\)</i></b>. Note<br>
 present active infinitive, to keep on waiting for <b><i>(around,<br>
 \peri\)</i></b>. In the Great Commission on the mountain in Galilee this<br>
 item was not given <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 28:16-20)</i></b>. It is the subjective<br>
 genitive, the promise given by the Father <b><i>(note this Johannine<br>
 use of the word)</i></b>, that is the Holy Spirit <b><i>("the promise of the<br>
 Holy Spirit," objective genitive)</i></b>. <B>{Which ye heard from me}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;n<br>
 &#275;kousate mou\)</i></b>. Change from indirect discourse <b><i>(command)</i></b>,<br>
 infinitives \ch&#333;rizesthai\ and \perimenein\ after \par&#275;ggeilen\<br>
 to direct discourse without any \eph&#275;\ <b><i>(said he)</i></b> as the English<br>
 <b><i>(Italics)</i></b>. Luke often does this <b><i>(_oratior ariata_)</i></b>. Note also the<br>
 ablative case of \mou\ <b><i>(from me)</i></b>. Luke continues in verse <!-#-->5<br>
 with the direct discourse giving the words of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 1:5 <B>{Baptized with water}</B> <b><i>(\ebaptisen hudati\)</i></b> <B>{and with the Holy<br>
 Ghost}</B> <b><i>(\en pneumati baptisth&#275;sesthe hagi&#333;i\)</i></b>. The margin has "in<br>
 the Holy Ghost" <b><i>(Spirit, it should be)</i></b>. The American Standard<br>
 Version renders "in" both with "water" and "Holy Spirit" as do<br>
 Goodspeed <b><i>(American Translation)</i></b> and Mrs. Montgomery <b><i>(Centenary<br>
 Translation)</i></b>. John's own words <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 3:11)</i></b> to which Jesus<br>
 apparently refers use \en\ <b><i>(in)</i></b> both with water and Spirit. There<br>
 is a so-called instrumental use of \en\ where we in English have<br>
 to say "with" <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 13:10 \en machair&#275;i\, like \machair&#275;i\, <!-#-->Ac<br>
 12:2)</i></b>. That is to say \en\ with the locative presents the act as<br>
 located in a certain instrument like a sword <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, pp. 589f.)</i></b>. But the instrumental case is more common<br>
 without \en\ <b><i>(the locative and instrumental cases having the same<br>
 form)</i></b>. So it is often a matter of indifference which idiom is<br>
 used as in <!-#-->Joh 21:8 we have \t&#333;i ploiari&#333;i\ <b><i>(locative without<br>
 \en\)</i></b>. They came <B>{in}</B> <b><i>(locative case without \en\)</i></b> the boat. So<br>
 in <!-#-->Joh 1:31 \en hudati baptiz&#333;n\ baptizing in water. No<br>
 distinction therefore can be insisted on here between the<br>
 construction \hudati\ and \en pneumati\ <b><i>(both being in the<br>
 locative case, one without, one with \en\)</i></b>. Note unusual position<br>
 of the verb \baptisth&#275;sesthe\ <b><i>(future passive indicative)</i></b> between<br>
 \pneumati\ and \hagi&#333;i\. This baptism of the Holy Spirit was<br>
 predicted by John <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 3:11)</i></b> as the characteristic of the<br>
 Messiah's work. Now the Messiah himself in his last message<br>
 before his Ascension proclaims that in a few days the fulfilment<br>
 of that prophecy will come to pass. The Codex Bezae adds here<br>
 "which ye are about to receive" and "until the Pentecost" to<br>
 verse <!-#-->5. <B>{Not many days hence}</B> <b><i>(\ou meta pollas tautas<br>
 h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. A neat Greek idiom difficult to render smoothly into<br>
 English: "Not after many days these." The litotes <b><i>(not many=few)</i></b><br>
 is common in Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 7:6; 15:13; Ac 17:27; 19:11; 20:12; 21:39;<br>
 28:14; 28:2)</i></b>. The predicate use of \tautas\ <b><i>(without article)</i></b> is<br>
 to be noted. "These" really means as a starting point, "from<br>
 these" <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 702)</i></b>. It was ten days hence.<br>
 This idiom occurs several times in Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:21; Ac 24:21)</i></b>,<br>
 as elsewhere <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 4:18; 2Pe 3:1)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Lu 2:12 the copula is<br>
 easily supplied as it exists in <!-#-->Lu 1:36; 2:2.<br>
 <br>
 1:6 <B>{They therefore}</B> <b><i>(\hoi men oun\)</i></b>. Demonstrative use of \hoi\<br>
 with \men oun\ without any corresponding \de\ just as in <!-#-->1:1<br>
 \men\ occurs alone. The combination \men oun\ is common in Acts<br>
 <b><i>(27 times)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Lu 3:18. The \oun\ is resumptive and refers to<br>
 the introductory verses <b><i>(<!-#-->1:1-5)</i></b>, which served to connect the<br>
 Acts with the preceding Gospel. The narrative now begins. <B>{Asked}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;r&#333;t&#333;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, repeatedly asked before Jesus<br>
 answered. <B>{Lord}</B> <b><i>(\kurie\)</i></b>. Here not in the sense of "sir" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 21:30)</i></b>, but to Jesus as Lord and Master as often in Acts<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->19:5,10, etc.)</i></b> and in prayer to Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->7:59)</i></b>. <B>{Dost thou<br>
 restore}</B> <b><i>(\ei apokathistaneis\)</i></b>. The use of \ei\ in an indirect<br>
 question is common. We have already seen its use in direct<br>
 questions <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 12:10; Lu 13:23 which see for discussion)</i></b>,<br>
 possibly in imitation of the Hebrew <b><i>(frequent in the LXX)</i></b> or as a<br>
 partial condition without conclusion. See also <!-#-->Ac 7:1; 19:2;<br>
 21:37; 22:25. The form of the verb \apokathistan&#333;\ is late <b><i>(also<br>
 \apokathista&#333;\)</i></b> omega form for the old and common<br>
 \apokathist&#275;mi\, double compound, to restore to its former state.<br>
 As a matter of fact the Messianic kingdom for which they are<br>
 asking is a political kingdom that would throw off the hated<br>
 Roman yoke. It is a futuristic present and they are uneasy that<br>
 Jesus may yet fail to fulfil their hopes. Surely here is proof<br>
 that the eleven apostles needed the promise of the Father before<br>
 they began to spread the message of the Risen Christ. They still<br>
 yearn for a political kingdom for Israel even after faith and<br>
 hope have come back. They need the enlightenment of the Holy<br>
 Spirit <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 14-16)</i></b> and the power of the Holy Spirit <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 1:4f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:7 <B>{Times or seasons}</B> <b><i>(\chronous &#275; kairous\)</i></b>. "Periods" and<br>
 "points" of time sometimes and probably so here, but such a<br>
 distinction is not always maintained. See <!-#-->Ac 17:26 for<br>
 \kairous\ in the same sense as \chronous\ for long periods of<br>
 time. But here some distinction seems to be called for. It is<br>
 curious how eager people have always been to fix definite dates<br>
 about the second coming of Christ as the apostles were about the<br>
 political Messianic kingdom which they were expecting. <B>{Hath set}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\etheto\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle indicative, emphasizing the<br>
 sovereignty of the Father in keeping all such matters to himself,<br>
 a gentle hint to people today about the limits of curiosity. Note<br>
 also "his own" <b><i>(\idi&#257;i\)</i></b> "authority" <b><i>(\exousi&#257;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:8 <B>{Power}</B> <b><i>(\dunamin\)</i></b>. Not the "power" about which they were<br>
 concerned <b><i>(political organization and equipments for empire on<br>
 the order of Rome)</i></b>. Their very question was ample proof of their<br>
 need of this new "power" <b><i>(\dunamin\)</i></b>, to enable them <b><i>(from<br>
 \dunamai\, to be able)</i></b>, to grapple with the spread of the gospel<br>
 in the world. <B>{When the Holy Ghost is come upon you}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epelthontos tou hagiou pneumatos eph' humas\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute and is simultaneous in time with the preceding verb<br>
 "shall receive" <b><i>(\l&#275;mpsesthe\)</i></b>. The Holy Spirit will give them<br>
 the "power" as he comes upon them. This is the baptism of the<br>
 Holy Spirit referred to in verse <!-#-->5. <B>{My witnesses}</B> <b><i>(\mou<br>
 martures\)</i></b>. Correct text. "Royal words of magnificent and Divine<br>
 assurance" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. Our word martyrs is this word \martures\.<br>
 In <!-#-->Lu 24:48 Jesus calls the disciples "witnesses to these<br>
 things" <b><i>(\martures tout&#333;n\, objective genitive)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Ac 1:22 an<br>
 apostle has to be a "witness to the Resurrection" of Christ and<br>
 in <!-#-->10:39 to the life and work of Jesus. Hence there could be no<br>
 "apostles" in this sense after the first generation. But here the<br>
 apostles are called "my witnesses." "His by a direct personal<br>
 relationship" <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. The expanding sphere of their witness<br>
 when the Holy Spirit comes upon them is "unto the uttermost part<br>
 of the earth" <b><i>(\he&#333;s eschatou t&#275;s g&#275;s\)</i></b>. Once they had been<br>
 commanded to avoid Samaria <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:5)</i></b>, but now it is included in<br>
 the world program as already outlined on the mountain in Galilee<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 28:19; Mr 16:15)</i></b>. Jesus is on Olivet as he points to<br>
 Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, the uttermost <b><i>(last, \eschatou\)</i></b> part<br>
 of the earth. The program still beckons us on to world conquest<br>
 for Christ. "The Acts themselves form the best commentary on<br>
 these words, and the words themselves might be given as the best<br>
 summary of the Acts" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. The events follow this outline<br>
 <b><i>(Jerusalem till the end of chapter 7, with the martyrdom of<br>
 Stephen, the scattering of the saints through Judea and Samaria<br>
 in chapter 8, the conversion of Saul, chapter 9, the spread of<br>
 the gospel to Romans in Caesarea by Peter <b><i>(chapter 10)</i></b>, to Greeks<br>
 in Antioch <b><i>(chapter 11)</i></b>, finally Paul's world tours and arrest<br>
 and arrival in Rome(chapters 11 to 28)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:9 <B>{As they were looking}</B> <b><i>(\blepont&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute. The present participle accents the fact that they were<br>
 looking directly at Jesus. <B>{He was taken up}</B> <b><i>(ep&#275;rth&#275;)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive indicative of \epair&#333;\, old and common verb<br>
 meaning to lift up. In <!-#-->Lu 24:51 we have "he was borne up"<br>
 <b><i>(\anephereto\)</i></b> and in <!-#-->Ac 1:2, 1:11; 1Ti 3:6 "was received up"<br>
 <b><i>(\anel&#275;mpth&#275;\)</i></b>. <B>{Received}</B> <b><i>(\hupelaben\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative of \hupolamban&#333;\, literally here "took under him." He<br>
 seemed to be supported by the cloud. "In glory" Paul adds in <!-#-->1Ti<br>
 3:16. <B>{Out of their sight}</B> <b><i>(\apo t&#333;n ophthalm&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. From<br>
 their eyes <b><i>(\apo\ with ablative case)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:10 <B>{Were looking steadfastly}</B> <b><i>(\atenizontes &#275;san\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic imperfect active of \ateniz&#333;\, a late intensive verb<br>
 <b><i>(intensive \a\ and \tein&#333;\, to stretch)</i></b>. Common in Acts and also<br>
 in <!-#-->Lu 4:20; 22:56 as well as <!-#-->Ac 10:4, which see. <B>{As he went}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\poreuomenou autou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute of present middle<br>
 participle. They saw him slipping away from their eyes as the<br>
 cloud bore him away. <B>{Stood by them}</B> <b><i>(\pareist&#275;keisan autois\)</i></b>.<br>
 Past perfect active indicative of \parist&#275;mi\ and intransitive<br>
 <b><i>(note \i\ in B instead of \ei\ for augment, mere itacism)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:11 <B>{Who also}</B> <b><i>(\hoi kai\)</i></b>. Common use of \kai\ pleonastic to<br>
 show that the two events were parallel. This is the simplest way<br>
 from Homer on to narrate two parallel events. <B>{Why?}</B> <b><i>(\ti\)</i></b>.<br>
 Jesus had told them of his coming Ascension <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:62; 20:17)</i></b><br>
 so that they should have been prepared. <B>{This Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\houtos ho<br>
 I&#275;sous\)</i></b>. _Qui vobis fuit eritque semper Jesus, id est, Salvator_<br>
 <b><i>(Corn. a Lapide)</i></b>. The personal name assures them that Jesus will<br>
 always be in heaven a personal friend and divine Saviour<br>
 <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. <B>{So in like manner}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s hon tropon\)</i></b>. Same idea<br>
 twice. "So in which manner" <b><i>(incorporation of antecedent and<br>
 accusative of general reference)</i></b>. The fact of his second coming<br>
 and the manner of it also described by this emphatic repetition.<br>
 <br>
 1:12 <B>{Olivet}</B> <b><i>(\Elai&#333;nos\)</i></b>. Genitive singular. Vulgate<br>
 _Olivetum_. Made like \ampel&#333;n\. Here only in the N.T., usually<br>
 \to oros t&#333;n Elai&#333;n\ <b><i>(the Mount of Olives)</i></b>, though some MSS. have<br>
 Olivet in <!-#-->Lu 19:29; 21:37. Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. VII. 9, 2)</i></b> has it<br>
 also and the papyri <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient East_, p.<br>
 170)</i></b>. <B>{A sabbath day's journey off}</B> <b><i>(\Sabbatou ech&#333;n hodon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Luke only says here that Olivet is a Sabbath day's journey from<br>
 Jerusalem, not that Jesus was precisely that distance when he<br>
 ascended. In the Gospel Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->24:50)</i></b> states that Jesus led them<br>
 "over against" <b><i>(\he&#333;s pros\)</i></b> Bethany <b><i>(about two miles or fifteen<br>
 furlongs)</i></b>. The top of Olivet is six furlongs or three-fourths of<br>
 a mile. The Greek idiom here is "having a journey of a Sabbath"<br>
 after "which is nigh unto Jerusalem" <b><i>(\ho estin eggus<br>
 Ierousal&#275;m\)</i></b>, note the periphrastic construction. Why Luke<br>
 mentions this item for Gentile readers in this form is not known,<br>
 unless it was in his Jewish source. See <!-#-->Ex 16:29; Nu 35:5; Jos<br>
 3:4. But it does not contradict what he says in <!-#-->Lu 24:50,<br>
 where he does not say that Jesus led them all the way to Bethany.<br>
 <br>
 1:13 <B>{Into the upper chamber}</B> <b><i>(\eis to huper&#333;ion\)</i></b>. The upstairs<br>
 or upper room <b><i>(\huper\ is upper or over, the adjective<br>
 \huper&#333;ios\)</i></b>, the room upstairs where the women staid in Homer,<br>
 then a room up under the flat roof for retirement or prayer <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 9:37,39)</i></b>, sometimes a large third story room suitable for<br>
 gatherings <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:9)</i></b>. It is possible, even probable, that this<br>
 is the "large upper room" <b><i>(\an&#333;geon mega\)</i></b> of <!-#-->Mr 14:15; Lu<br>
 22:12. The Vulgate has _coenaculum_ for both words. The word is<br>
 used in the N.T. only in Acts. It was in a private house as in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 22:11 and not in the temple as <!-#-->Lu 24:53 might imply,<br>
 "continually" <b><i>(\dia pantos\)</i></b> these words probably meaning on<br>
 proper occasions. <B>{They were abiding}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san katamenontes\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic imperfect active. Perfective use of \kata\, to abide<br>
 permanently. It is possible that this is the house of Mary the<br>
 mother of John Mark where the disciples later met for prayer <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 12:12)</i></b>. Here alone in the N.T., though old compound. Some MSS.<br>
 here read \paramenontes\. This could mean constant residence, but<br>
 most likely frequent resort for prayer during these days, some<br>
 being on hand all the time as they came and went. <B>{Simon the<br>
 Zealot}</B> <b><i>(\Simon ho Z&#275;l&#333;t&#275;s\)</i></b>. Called Simon the Cananaean <b><i>(\ho<br>
 Cananaios\)</i></b> in <!-#-->Mt 10:4, Mr 3:18, but Zealot in <!-#-->Lu 6:16 as<br>
 here giving the Greek equivalent of the Aramaic word because Luke<br>
 has Gentiles in mind. The epithet <b><i>(member of the party of<br>
 Zealots)</i></b> clung to him after he became an apostle and<br>
 distinguishes him from Simon Peter. See Vol. I on the Gospel of<br>
 Matthew for discussion of the four lists of the apostles. <B>{Judas<br>
 the son of James}</B> <b><i>(\Joudas Iak&#333;bou\)</i></b>. Literally, Judas of James,<br>
 whether son or brother <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Jude 1:1)</i></b> we do not really know.<br>
 "Of James" is added to distinguish him from Judas Iscariot <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 14:22)</i></b>. However we take it, he must be identified with the<br>
 Thaddaeus <b><i>(=Lebbaeus)</i></b> of Mark and Matthew to make the list in the<br>
 third group identical. No name appears in Acts for that of Judas<br>
 Iscariot.<br>
 <br>
 1:14 <B>{With one accord}</B> <b><i>(\homothumadon\)</i></b>. Old adverb in \-don\<br>
 from adjective \homothumos\ and that from \homos\, same, and<br>
 \thumos\, mind or spirit, with the same mind or spirit. Common in<br>
 ancient Greek and papyri. In the N.T. eleven times in Acts and<br>
 nowhere else save <!-#-->Ro 15:6. See <!-#-->Mt 18:19. <B>{Continued}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san<br>
 proskarterountes\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect active of<br>
 \proskartere&#333;\, old verb from \pros\ <b><i>(perfective use)</i></b> and<br>
 \kartere&#333;\ from \karteros\, strong, steadfast, like the English<br>
 "carry on." Already in <!-#-->Mr 3:9 which see and several times in<br>
 Acts and Paul's Epistles. They "stuck to" the praying <b><i>(\t&#275;i<br>
 proseuch&#275;i\, note article)</i></b> for the promise of the Father till the<br>
 answer came. <B>{With the women}</B> <b><i>(\sun gunaixin\)</i></b>. Associative<br>
 instrumental case plural of \gun&#275;\ after \sun\. As one would<br>
 expect when praying was the chief work on hand. More women<br>
 certainly included than in <!-#-->Lu 8:2; Mr 15:40f.; Mt 27:55f.; Lu<br>
 23:49; Mr 15:47; Mt 27:61; Lu 23:55f.; Mr 16:1; Mt 28:1; Lu<br>
 24:1f.; Joh 20:1, 11-18; Mt 28:9f. There were probably other<br>
 women also whose testimony was no longer scouted as it had been<br>
 at first. Codex Bezae adds here "and children." <B>{And Mary the<br>
 mother of Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\kai Mariam t&#275;i m&#275;tri tou I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. A delicate<br>
 touch by Luke that shows Mary with her crown of glory at last.<br>
 She had come out of the shadow of death with the song in her<br>
 heart and with the realization of the angel's promise and the<br>
 prophecy of Simeon. It was a blessed time for Mary. <B>{With his<br>
 brethren}</B> <b><i>(\sun tois adelphois autou\)</i></b>. With his brothers, it<br>
 should be translated. They had once disbelieved in him <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 7:5)</i></b>. Jesus had appeared to James <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:7)</i></b> and now it is a<br>
 happy family of believers including the mother and brothers<br>
 <b><i>(half-brothers, literally)</i></b> of Jesus. They continue in prayer for<br>
 the power from on high.<br>
 <br>
 1:15 <B>{Brethren}</B> <b><i>(\adelph&#333;n\)</i></b>. Codex Bezae has "disciples."<br>
 <B>{Multitude of persons}</B> <b><i>(\ochlos onomat&#333;n\)</i></b>. Literally, multitude<br>
 of names. This Hebraistic use of \onoma\=person occurs in the LXX<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 1:2; 18:20; 3:40,43; 26:53)</i></b> and in <!-#-->Re 3:4; 11:13.<br>
 <B>{Together}</B> <b><i>(\epi to auto\)</i></b>. The word "gathered" is not in the<br>
 Greek here, but it does occur in <!-#-->Mt 22:34 and that is<br>
 undoubtedly the idea in <!-#-->Lu 17:35 as in <!-#-->Ac 2:1,44,47; 1Co<br>
 11:20; 14:23. So also here. They were in the same place <b><i>(\to<br>
 auto\)</i></b>. <B>{About a hundred and twenty}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s hekaton eikosi\)</i></b>. A<br>
 crowd for "the upper room." No special significance in the number<br>
 120, just the number there.<br>
 <br>
 1:16 <B>{Brethren}</B> <b><i>(\andres adelphoi\)</i></b>. Literally, men, brethren or<br>
 brother men. More dignified and respectful than just "brethren."<br>
 Demosthenes sometimes said \Andres Ath&#275;naioi\. Cf. our "gentlemen<br>
 and fellow-citizens." Women are included in this address though<br>
 \andres\ refers only to men. <B>{It was needful}</B> <b><i>(\edei\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 tense of the impersonal \dei\ with the infinitive clause <b><i>(first<br>
 aorist passive)</i></b> and the accusative of general reference as a<br>
 loose subject. Peter here assumes that Jesus is the Messiah and<br>
 finds scripture illustrative of the treachery of Judas. He<br>
 applies it to Judas and quotes the two passages in verse <!-#-->20<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps 69:25; 109:8)</i></b>. The Holy Spirit has not yet come upon them,<br>
 but Peter feels moved to interpret the situation. He feels that<br>
 his mind is opened by Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:45)</i></b>. It is a logical, not a<br>
 moral, necessity that Peter points out. Peter here claims the<br>
 Holy Spirit as speaking in the scriptures as he does in <!-#-->2Pe<br>
 1:21. His description of Judas as "guide" <b><i>(\hod&#275;gou\)</i></b> to those<br>
 who seized <b><i>(\sullabousin\)</i></b> Jesus is that of the base traitor that<br>
 he was. This very verb occurs in <!-#-->Lu 22:54 of the arrest of<br>
 Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 1:17 <B>{Was numbered}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;rithmenos &#275;n\)</i></b>. Periphrastic past<br>
 perfect passive indicative of \katarithme&#333;\, old verb, but here<br>
 only in the N.T. <b><i>(perfective use of \kata\)</i></b>. <B>{Received his<br>
 portion}</B> <b><i>(\elachen ton kl&#275;ron\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative<br>
 of \lagchan&#333;\, old verb, to obtain by lot as in <!-#-->Lu 1:9; Joh<br>
 19:24, especially by divine appointment as here and <!-#-->2Pe 2:1.<br>
 \Kl&#275;ros\ also means lot, an object used in casting lots <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 1:26)</i></b>, or what is obtained by lot as here and <!-#-->8:21, of eternal<br>
 salvation <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 26:18; Col 1:12)</i></b>, of persons chosen by divine<br>
 appointment <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 5:3)</i></b>. From this latter usage the Latin<br>
 _cleros, clericus_, our clergy, one chosen by divine lot. So<br>
 Peter says that Judas "obtained by lot the lot of this ministry"<br>
 <b><i>(\diakonias\)</i></b> which he had when he betrayed Jesus. The Master<br>
 chose him and gave him his opportunity.<br>
 <br>
 1:18 <B>{Now this man}</B> <b><i>(\Houtos men oun\)</i></b>. Note \men oun\ again<br>
 without a corresponding \de\ as in <!-#-->1:6. Verses <!-#-->18,19 are a<br>
 long parenthesis of Luke by way of explanation of the fate of<br>
 Judas. In verse <!-#-->20 Peter resumes and quotes the scripture to<br>
 which he referred in verse <!-#-->16. <B>{Obtained}</B> <b><i>(\ekt&#275;sato\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist middle indicative of \ktaomai\, to acquire, only in the<br>
 middle, to get for oneself. With the covenant money for the<br>
 betrayal, acquired it indirectly apparently according to <!-#-->Mt<br>
 26:14-16; 27:3-8 which see. <B>{Falling headlong}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#275;n&#275;s<br>
 genomenos\)</i></b>. Attic form usually \pran&#275;s\. The word means, not<br>
 "headlong," but "flat on the face" as opposed to \huptios\ on the<br>
 back <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>. Hackett observes that the place suits admirably<br>
 the idea that Judas hung himself <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:5)</i></b> and, the rope<br>
 breaking, fell flat on his face and <B>{burst asunder in the midst}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\elak&#275;sen mesos\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of \lask&#333;\ old<br>
 verb <b><i>(here only in the N.T.)</i></b>, to clang, to crack, to crash, like<br>
 a falling tree. Aristophanes uses it of crashing bones. \Mesos\<br>
 is predicate nominative referring to Judas. <B>{Gushed out}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\exechuth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of \ekche&#333;\, to<br>
 pour out.<br>
 <br>
 1:19 <B>{Language}</B> <b><i>(\dialekt&#333;i\)</i></b>. Not a dialect of the Greek, but a<br>
 different language, the Aramaic. So also in <!-#-->2:6; 21:40.<br>
 \Dialektos\ is from \dialegomai\, to converse, to speak between<br>
 two <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b>. <B>{Akeldama}</B> <b><i>(\Hakeldamach\)</i></b>. This Aramaic word Peter<br>
 explains as "the field of blood." Two traditions are preserved:<br>
 one in <!-#-->Mt 27:7 which explains that the priests purchased this<br>
 potter's field with the money which Judas flung down as the price<br>
 of the blood of Jesus. The other in Acts describes it as the<br>
 field of blood because Judas poured out his blood there. Hackett<br>
 and Knowling argue that both views can be true. "The ill-omened<br>
 name could be used with a double emphasis" <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:20 <B>{For it is written}</B> <b><i>(\gegraptai gar\)</i></b>. Luke here returns to<br>
 the address of Peter interrupted by verses <!-#-->18,19. Perfect<br>
 passive indicative, the usual idiom in quoting scripture, stands<br>
 written. <!-#-->Ps 69 is often quoted as Messianic in Matthew and<br>
 John. <B>{His habitation}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; epaulis autou\)</i></b>. Only here in the<br>
 N.T., a country house, cottage, cabin. <B>{His office}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n<br>
 episkop&#275;n autou\)</i></b>. Our word bishopric <b><i>(Authorized Version)</i></b> is<br>
 from this word, office of bishop <b><i>(\episcopos\)</i></b>. Only that is not<br>
 the idea here, but over-seership <b><i>(\epi, skope&#333;\)</i></b> or office as in<br>
 <!-#-->1Pe 2:12. It means to visit and to inspect, to look over. The<br>
 ecclesiastical sense comes later <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 3:1)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:21 <B>{Must}</B> <b><i>(\dei\)</i></b>. Present necessity corresponding to the old<br>
 necessity <b><i>(\edei\)</i></b> about Judas <b><i>(verse <!-#-->16)</i></b>. This sentence in<br>
 verses <!-#-->21,22 begins with \dei\. <B>{That}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;i\)</i></b>. Locative case<br>
 of the relative attracted to the case of the antecedent. <B>{Went in<br>
 and went out}</B> <b><i>(\eis&#275;lthen kai ex&#275;lthen\)</i></b>. Constative aorist<br>
 active. <B>{With us}</B> <b><i>(\eph' h&#275;mas\)</i></b>. <B>{Over us}</B>, the margin has it.<br>
 But the full phrase would be \eph' h&#275;mas kai aph' h&#275;m&#333;n\. He came<br>
 to us and went from us <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:22 <B>{Beginning}</B> <b><i>(\arxamenos\)</i></b>. Aorist middle participle of<br>
 \arch&#333;\, agreeing <b><i>(nominative)</i></b> with \ho kurios I&#275;sous\ <b><i>(the Lord<br>
 Jesus)</i></b>. The ministry of Jesus began with the ministry of John.<br>
 Strictly speaking \arxamenos\ should be the accusative and agree<br>
 with \martura\ <b><i>(witness)</i></b> in verse <!-#-->22, but the construction is a<br>
 bit free. The ministry of Jesus began with the baptism of John<br>
 and lasted until the Ascension. <B>{A witness with us of his<br>
 resurrection}</B> <b><i>(\martura t&#275;s anastase&#333;s autou sun h&#275;min\)</i></b>. This<br>
 Peter considers the essential thing in a successor to Judas. The<br>
 one chosen should be a personal witness who can speak from his<br>
 own experience of the ministry, resurrection, and ascension of<br>
 the Lord Jesus. One can easily see that this qualification will<br>
 soon put an end to those who bear such personal testimony.<br>
 <br>
 1:23 <B>{They put forward two}</B> <b><i>(\est&#275;san duo\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative <b><i>(transitive)</i></b> of \hist&#275;mi\ <b><i>(not intransitive second<br>
 aorist, though same form in the third person plural)</i></b>. Somebody<br>
 nominated two names, Justus and Matthias.<br>
 <br>
 1:24 <B>{Show us the one whom thou hast chosen}</B> <b><i>(\anadeixon hon<br>
 exelex&#333;\)</i></b>. First aorist active imperative of \anadeiknumi\, to<br>
 show up, make plain. First aorist middle indicative second person<br>
 singular of \ekleg&#333;\, to pick out, choose, select. In this prayer<br>
 they assume that God has made a choice. They only wish to know<br>
 his will. They call God the <B>{heart-searcher}</B> or <B>{heart-knower}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kardiogn&#333;sta\, vocative singular)</i></b>, a late word, here and <!-#-->Ac<br>
 15:8 only in the N.T. Modern physicians have delicate apparatus<br>
 for studying the human heart.<br>
 <br>
 1:25 <B>{Apostleship}</B> <b><i>(\apostol&#275;s\)</i></b>. Jesus had called the twelve<br>
 apostles. An old word for sending away, then for a release, then<br>
 the office and dignity of an apostle <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 1:25; Ro 1:5; 1Co 9:2;<br>
 Gal 2:8)</i></b>. <B>{To his own place}</B> <b><i>(\eis ton topon ton idion\)</i></b>. A bold<br>
 and picturesque description of the destiny of Judas worthy of<br>
 Dante's _Inferno_. There is no doubt in Peter's mind of the<br>
 destiny of Judas nor of his own guilt. He made ready his own<br>
 berth and went to it.<br>
 <br>
 1:26 <B>{He was numbered}</B> <b><i>(\sunkateps&#275;phisth&#275;\)</i></b>. To the Jews the lot<br>
 did not suggest gambling, but "the O.T. method of learning the<br>
 will of Jehovah" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. The two nominations made a decision<br>
 necessary and they appealed to God in this way. This double<br>
 compound \sunkataps&#275;phiz&#333;\ occurs here alone in the N.T. and<br>
 elsewhere only in Plutarch <b><i>(_Them_. 21)</i></b> in the middle voice for<br>
 condemning with others. \Sunps&#275;phiz&#333;\ occurs in the middle voice<br>
 in <!-#-->Ac 19:19 for counting up money and also in Aristophanes.<br>
 \Ps&#275;phiz&#333;\ with \dapan&#275;n\ occurs in <!-#-->Lu 14:28 for counting the<br>
 cost and in <!-#-->Re 13:18 for "counting" the number of the beast.<br>
 The ancients used pebbles <b><i>(\ps&#275;phoi\)</i></b> in voting, black for<br>
 condemning, white <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 2:17)</i></b> in acquitting. Here it is used in<br>
 much the same sense as \katarithme&#333;\ in verse <!-#-->17.<br>
