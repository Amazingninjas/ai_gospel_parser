<p>6:1 <B>{Dare any of you?}</B> <b><i>(\tolm&#257;i tis hum&#333;n;\)</i></b>. Does any one of you<br>
 dare? Rhetorical question with present indicative of \tolma&#333;\,<br>
 old verb from \tolma\, daring. Bengel: _grandi verbo notatur<br>
 laesa majestas Christianorum_.  "The word is an argument in<br>
 itself" <b><i>(Robertson and Plummer)</i></b>. Apparently Paul has an actual<br>
 case in mind as in chapter <!-#-->1Co 5 though no name is called.<br>
 <B>{Having a matter against his neighbour}</B> <b><i>(\pragma ech&#333;n pros ton<br>
 heteron\)</i></b>. Forensic sense of \pragma\ <b><i>(from \prass&#333;\, to do, to<br>
 exact, to extort as in <!-#-->Lu 3:13)</i></b>, a case, a suit <b><i>(Demosthenes<br>
 1020, 26)</i></b>, with the other or the neighbour as in <!-#-->10:24; 14:17;<br>
 Ga 6:4; Ro 2:1. <B>{Go to law}</B> <b><i>(\krinesthai\)</i></b>. Present middle or<br>
 passive <b><i>(ch. <!-#-->Ro 3:4)</i></b> in the same forensic sense as \krith&#275;nai\<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 5:40. \Krit&#275;s\, judge, is from this verb. <B>{Before the<br>
 unrighteous}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#333;n adik&#333;n\)</i></b>. This use of \epi\ with the<br>
 genitive for "in the presence of" is idiomatic as in <!-#-->2Co 7:14,<br>
 \epi Titou\, in the case of Titus. The Jews held that to bring a<br>
 lawsuit before a court of idolaters was blasphemy against the<br>
 law. But the Greeks were fond of disputatious lawsuits with each<br>
 other. Probably the Greek Christians brought cases before pagan<br>
 judges.<br>
 <br>
 6:2 <B>{Shall judge the world}</B> <b><i>(\ton kosmon krinousin\)</i></b>. Future<br>
 active indicative. At the last day with the Lord Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 19:28; Lu 22:30)</i></b>. <B>{Are ye unworthy to judge the smallest<br>
 matters?}</B> <b><i>(\anaxioi este krit&#275;ri&#333;n elachist&#333;n;\)</i></b>. \Anaxios\ is an<br>
 old word <b><i>(\an\ and \axios\)</i></b>, though only here in the N.T. There<br>
 is dispute as to the meaning of \krit&#275;ria\ here and in verse <!-#-->4,<br>
 old word, but nowhere else in N.T. save in <!-#-->Jas 2:6. Naturally,<br>
 like other words in \-t&#275;rion\ <b><i>(\akroat&#275;rion\, auditorium, <!-#-->Ac<br>
 25:23)</i></b>, this word means the place where judgment is rendered, or<br>
 court. It is common in the papyri in the sense of tribunal. In<br>
 the _Apost. Const_. ii. 45 we have \m&#275; erchesth&#333; epi krit&#275;rion<br>
 ethnikon\ <b><i>(Let him not come before a heathen tribunal)</i></b>. Hence<br>
 here it would mean, "Are ye unworthy of the smallest tribunals?"<br>
 That is, of sitting on the smallest tribunals, of forming courts<br>
 yourselves to settle such things?<br>
 <br>
 6:3 <B>{How much more, things that pertain to this life?}</B> <b><i>(\M&#275;ti ge<br>
 bi&#333;tika;\)</i></b>. The question expects the answer no and \ge\ adds<br>
 sharp point to Paul's surprised tone, "Need I so much as say?" It<br>
 can be understood also as ellipsis, "let me not say" <b><i>(\m&#275;tige<br>
 leg&#333;\)</i></b>, not to say. \Bi&#333;tika\ occurs first in Aristotle, but is<br>
 common afterwards. In the papyri it is used of business matters.<br>
 It is from \bios\ <b><i>(manner of life in contrast to \z&#333;&#275;\, life<br>
 principle)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:4 <B>{If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\bi&#333;tika men oun krit&#275;ria ean ech&#275;te\)</i></b>. Note emphatic position<br>
 <b><i>(proleptic)</i></b> of \bi&#333;tika krit&#275;ria\ <b><i>(tribunals pertaining to this<br>
 life, as above)</i></b>. "If ye have tribunals pertaining to this life"<br>
 <b><i>(condition of third class, \ean ech&#275;te\)</i></b>. If \kathizete\ <b><i>(do ye<br>
 set)</i></b> is indicative and interrogative, then by "who are of no<br>
 account in the church" <b><i>(\tous exouthen&#275;menous en t&#275;i ekkl&#275;si&#257;i\)</i></b><br>
 Paul means the heathen as in verse <!-#-->1. If \kathizete\ be<br>
 imperative, then Paul means the least esteemed members of the<br>
 church for such unwished for work. It is a harsh term for the<br>
 heathen, but one of indignation toward Christians.<br>
 <br>
 6:5 <B>{I say this to move you to shame}</B> <b><i>(\pros entrop&#275;n humin<br>
 leg&#333;\)</i></b>. Old word \entrop&#275;\ from \entrep&#333;\, to turn in <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 4:14<br>
 which see)</i></b>. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->15:34. <B>{One wise man}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sophos\)</i></b>. From sarcasm to pathos Paul turns. <B>{Does there not<br>
 exist}</B> <b><i>(\eni\, short form for \enesti\)</i></b>? With double negative<br>
 \ouk--oudeis\, expecting the answer yes. Surely <B>{one}</B> such man<br>
 exists in the church. <B>{Who}</B> <b><i>(\hos\)</i></b>. Almost consecutive in idea,<br>
 of such wisdom that he will be able. <B>{To decide between his<br>
 brethren}</B> <b><i>(\diakrinai ana meson tou adelphou autou\)</i></b>. \Krinai\ is<br>
 to judge or decide <b><i>(first aorist active infinitive of \krin&#333;\ and<br>
 \dia\ <b><i>(two)</i></b> carries on the idea of between. Then \ana meson\<br>
 makes it still plainer, in the midst as <B>{arbitrator}</B> between<br>
 brother and brother like \ana meson emou kai sou\ (<!-#-->Ge 23:15)</i></b>.<br>
 It is even so a condensed expression with part of it unexpressed<br>
 <b><i>(\ana meson kai tou adelphou autou\)</i></b> between brother and his<br>
 brother. The use of \adelphos\ has a sharp reflection on them for<br>
 their going to heathen judges to settle disputes between brothers<br>
 in Christ.<br>
 <br>
 6:6 <B>{And that before unbelievers}</B> <b><i>(\kai touto epi apist&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Climactic force of \kai\. The accusative of general reference<br>
 with \touto\. "That there should be disputes about \bi&#333;tika\ is<br>
 bad; that Christian should go to law with Christian is worse;<br>
 that Christians should do this before unbelievers is worst of<br>
 all" <b><i>(Robertson and Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:7 <B>{Nay, already it is altogether a defect among you}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;d&#275; men<br>
 oun hol&#333;s h&#275;tt&#275;ma humin estin\)</i></b>. "Indeed therefore there is to<br>
 you already <b><i>(to begin with, \&#275;d&#275;\, before any question of courts)</i></b><br>
 wholly defeat." \H&#275;tt&#275;ma\ <b><i>(from \h&#275;ttaomai\)</i></b> is only here, <!-#-->Ro<br>
 11:12; Isa 31:8 and ecclesiastical writers. See \h&#275;ttaomai\<br>
 <b><i>(from \h&#275;tt&#333;n\, less)</i></b> in <!-#-->2Co 12:13; 2Pe 2:19f. \Nik&#275;\ was<br>
 victory and \h&#275;tta\ defeat with the Greeks. It is defeat for<br>
 Christians to have lawsuits <b><i>(\krimata\, usually decrees or<br>
 judgments)</i></b> with one another. This was proof of the failure of<br>
 love and forgiveness <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 3:13)</i></b>. <B>{Take wrong}</B> <b><i>(\adikeisthe\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present middle indicative, of old verb \adike&#333;\ <b><i>(from \adikos\,<br>
 not right)</i></b>. Better undergo wrong yourself than suffer <B>{defeat}</B> in<br>
 the matter of love and forgiveness of a brother. <B>{Be defrauded}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\apostereisthe\)</i></b>. Permissive middle again like \adikeisthe\.<br>
 Allow yourselves to be robbed <b><i>(old verb to deprive, to rob)</i></b><br>
 rather than have a lawsuit.<br>
 <br>
 6:8 <B>{Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong and defraud}</B> <b><i>(\alla humeis<br>
 adikeite kai apostereite\)</i></b>. "But <b><i>(adversative \alla\, on the<br>
 contrary)</i></b> you <b><i>(emphatic)</i></b> do the wronging and the robbing" <b><i>(active<br>
 voices)</i></b> "and that your brethren" <b><i>(\kai touto adelphous\)</i></b>. Same<br>
 idiom as at close of verse <!-#-->6. The very climax of wrong-doings,<br>
 to stoop to do this with one's brethren in Christ.<br>
 <br>
 6:9 <B>{The unrighteous}</B> <b><i>(\adikoi\)</i></b>. To remind them of the verb<br>
 \adike&#333;\ just used. <B>{The Kingdom of God}</B> <b><i>(\theou basileian\)</i></b>.<br>
 Precisely, God's kingdom. <B>{Be not deceived}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; plan&#257;sthe\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present passive imperative with negative \m&#275;\. Do not be led<br>
 astray by plausible talk to cover up sin as mere animal<br>
 behaviourism. Paul has two lists in verses <!-#-->9,10, one with<br>
 repetition of \oute\, neither <b><i>(fornicators, idolaters,<br>
 adulterers, effeminate, or \malakoi\, abusers of themselves with<br>
 men or \arsenokoitai\ or sodomites as in <!-#-->1Ti 1:10 a late word<br>
 for this horrid vice, thieves, covetous)</i></b>, the other with \ou\ not<br>
 <b><i>(drunkards, revilers, extortioners)</i></b>. All these will fall short of<br>
 the kingdom of God. This was plain talk to a city like Corinth.<br>
 It is needed today. It is a solemn roll call of the damned even<br>
 if some of their names are on the church roll in Corinth whether<br>
 officers or ordinary members.<br>
 <br>
 6:11 <B>{And such were some of you}</B> <b><i>(\kai tauta tines &#275;te\)</i></b>. A sharp<br>
 homethrust. Literally, "And these things <b><i>(\tauta\, neuter plural)</i></b><br>
 were ye <b><i>(some of you)</i></b>." The horror is shown by \tauta\, but by<br>
 \tines\ Paul narrows the picture to some, not all. But that was<br>
 in the past <b><i>(\&#275;te\, imperfect indicative)</i></b> like <!-#-->Ro 6:17. Thank<br>
 God the blood of Jesus does cleanse from such sins as these. But<br>
 do not go back to them. <B>{But ye were washed}</B> <b><i>(\apelousasthe\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist middle indicative, not passive, of \apolou&#333;\. Either<br>
 direct middle, ye washed yourselves, or indirect middle, as in<br>
 <!-#-->Ac 22:16, ye washed your sins away <b><i>(force of \apo\)</i></b>. This was<br>
 their own voluntary act in baptism which was the outward<br>
 expression of the previous act of God in cleansing<br>
 <b><i>(\h&#275;giasth&#275;te\, ye were sanctified or cleansed before the<br>
 baptism)</i></b> and justified <b><i>(\edikai&#333;th&#275;te\, ye were put right with<br>
 God before the act of baptism)</i></b>. "These twin conceptions of the<br>
 Christian state in its beginning appear commonly in the reverse<br>
 order" <b><i>(Findlay)</i></b>. The outward expression is usually mentioned<br>
 before the inward change which precedes it. In this passage the<br>
 Trinity appear as in the baptismal command in <!-#-->Mt 28:19.<br>
 <br>
 6:12 <B>{Lawful}</B> <b><i>(\exestin\)</i></b>. Apparently this proverb may have been<br>
 used by Paul in Corinth <b><i>(repeated in <!-#-->10:23)</i></b>, but not in the<br>
 sense now used by Paul's opponents. The "all things" do not<br>
 include such matters as those condemned in chapter <!-#-->1Co 5;<br>
 6:1-11. Paul limits the proverb to things not immoral, things<br>
 not wrong _per se_. But even here liberty is not license. <B>{But<br>
 not all things are expedient}</B> <b><i>(\all' ou panta sumpherei\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 word \sumpherei\, bears together for good and so worthwhile. Many<br>
 things, harmless in themselves in the abstract, do harm to others<br>
 in the concrete. We live in a world of social relations that<br>
 circumscribe personal rights and liberties. <B>{But I will not be<br>
 brought under the power of any}</B> <b><i>(\all ouk eg&#333; exousiasth&#275;somai<br>
 hupo tinos\)</i></b>. Perhaps a conscious play on the verb \exestin\ for<br>
 \exousiaz&#333;\ is from \exousia\ and that from \exestin\. Verb from<br>
 Aristotle on, though not common <b><i>(Dion. of Hal., LXX and<br>
 inscriptions)</i></b>. In N.T. only here, <!-#-->7:4; Lu 22:25. Paul is<br>
 determined not to be a slave to anything harmless in itself. He<br>
 will maintain his self-control. He gives a wholesome hint to<br>
 those who talk so much about personal liberty.<br>
 <br>
 6:13 <B>{But God shall bring to nought both it and them}</B> <b><i>(\ho de<br>
 theos kai taut&#275;n kai tauta katarg&#275;sei\)</i></b>. Another proverb about<br>
 the adaptation of the belly <b><i>(\koilia\)</i></b> and food <b><i>(\br&#333;mata\, not<br>
 just flesh)</i></b>, which had apparently been used by some in Corinth to<br>
 justify sexual license <b><i>(fornication and adultery)</i></b>. These Gentiles<br>
 mixed up matters not alike at all <b><i>(questions of food and<br>
 sensuality)</i></b>. " We have traces of this gross moral confusion in<br>
 the circumstances which dictated the Apostolic Letter <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 15:23-29)</i></b>, where things wholly diverse are combined, as<br>
 directions about meats to be avoided and a prohibition of<br>
 fornication" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. Both the belly <b><i>(\taut&#275;n\)</i></b> and the foods<br>
 <b><i>(\tauta\)</i></b> God will bring to an end by death and change. <B>{But the<br>
 body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for<br>
 the body}</B> <b><i>(\to de s&#333;ma ou t&#275;i pornei&#257;i alla t&#333;i kuri&#333;i, kai ho<br>
 kurios t&#333;i s&#333;mati\)</i></b>. Paul here boldly shows the fallacy in the<br>
 parallel about appetite of the belly for food. The human body has<br>
 a higher mission than the mere gratification of sensual appetite.<br>
 Sex is of God for the propagation of the race, not for<br>
 prostitution. Paul had already stated that God dwells in us as<br>
 the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit <b><i>(<!-#-->3:16f.)</i></b>. This higher function<br>
 of the body he here puts forward against the debased Greek<br>
 philosophy of the time which ignored completely Paul's idea, "the<br>
 body for the Lord and the Lord for the body" <b><i>(dative of personal<br>
 interest in both cases)</i></b>. "The Lord Jesus and \porneia\ contested<br>
 for the bodies of Christian men; loyal to him they must renounce<br>
 _that_, yielding to _that_ they renounce him" <b><i>(Findlay)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:14 <B>{Will raise up us}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;mas exegerei\)</i></b>. Future active<br>
 indicative of \exegeir&#333;\ though the MSS. vary greatly, some<br>
 having the present and some even the aorist. But the resurrection<br>
 of the body gives added weight to Paul's argument about the<br>
 dignity and destiny of the body <b><i>(_quanta dignitas_, Bengel)</i></b> which<br>
 should not be prostituted to sensuality.<br>
 <br>
 6:15 <B>{Members of Christ}</B> <b><i>(\mel&#275; Christou\)</i></b>. Old word for limbs,<br>
 members. Even the Stoics held the body to be common with the<br>
 animals <b><i>(Epictetus, _Diss_. l. iii. 1)</i></b> and only the reason like<br>
 the gods. Without doubt some forms of modern evolution have<br>
 contributed to the licentious views of animalistic sex<br>
 indulgence, though the best teachers of biology show that in the<br>
 higher animals monogamy is the rule. The body is not only adapted<br>
 for Christ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->13)</i></b>, but it is a part of Christ, in vital<br>
 union with him. Paul will make much use of this figure further on<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->12:12-31; Eph 4:11-16; 5:30)</i></b>. <B>{Shall I then take away?}</B> <b><i>(\aras<br>
 oun;\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle of \air&#333;\, old verb to<br>
 snatch, carry off like Latin _rapio_ <b><i>(our rape)</i></b>. <B>{Make}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\poi&#275;s&#333;\)</i></b>. Can be either future active indicative or first<br>
 aorist active subjunctive <b><i>(deliberative)</i></b>. Either makes good<br>
 sense. The horror of deliberately taking "members of Christ" and<br>
 making them "members of a harlot" in an actual union staggers<br>
 Paul and should stagger us. <B>{God forbid}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; genoito\)</i></b>. Optative<br>
 second aorist in a negative wish for the future. <B>{May it not<br>
 happen!}</B> The word "God" is not here. The idiom is common in<br>
 Epictetus though rare in the LXX. Paul has it thirteen times and<br>
 Luke once <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 20:16)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:16 <B>{One body}</B> <b><i>(\hen s&#333;ma\)</i></b>. With the harlot. That union is for<br>
 the harlot the same as with the wife. The words quoted from <!-#-->Ge<br>
 2:24 describing the sexual union of husband and wife, are also<br>
 quoted and explained by Jesus in <!-#-->Mt 19:5f. which see for<br>
 discussion of the translation Hebraism with use of \eis\. <B>{Saith<br>
 he}</B> <b><i>(\ph&#275;sin\)</i></b>. Supply either \ho theos\ <b><i>(God)</i></b> or \h&#275; graph&#275;\<br>
 <b><i>(the Scripture)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:17 <B>{One spirit}</B> <b><i>(\hen pneuma\)</i></b>. With the Lord, the inner vital<br>
 spiritual union with the Lord Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph 4:4; 5:30)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:18 <B>{Flee}</B> <b><i>(\pheugete\)</i></b>. Present imperative. Have the habit of<br>
 fleeing without delay or parley. Note abruptness of the asyndeton<br>
 with no connectives. Fornication violates Christ's rights in our<br>
 bodies <b><i>(verses <!-#-->13-17)</i></b> and also ruins the body itself. <B>{Without<br>
 the body}</B> <b><i>(\ektos tou s&#333;matos\)</i></b>. Even gluttony and drunkenness<br>
 and the use of dope are sins wrought on the body, not "within the<br>
 body" <b><i>(\entos tou s&#333;matos\)</i></b> in the same sense as fornication.<br>
 Perhaps the dominant idea of Paul is that fornication, as already<br>
 shown, breaks the mystic bond between the body and Christ and<br>
 hence the fornicator <b><i>(\ho porneu&#333;n\)</i></b> <B>{sins against his own body}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eis to idion s&#333;ma hamartanei\)</i></b> in a sense not true of other<br>
 dreadful sins. The fornicator takes his body which belongs to<br>
 Christ and unites it with a harlot. In fornication the body is<br>
 the instrument of sin and becomes the subject of the damage<br>
 wrought. In another sense fornication brings on one's own body<br>
 the two most terrible bodily diseases that are still incurable<br>
 <b><i>(gonorrhea and syphilis)</i></b> that curse one's own body and transmit<br>
 the curse to the third and fourth generation. Apart from the high<br>
 view given here by Paul of the relation of the body to the Lord<br>
 no possible father or mother has the right to lay the hand of<br>
 such terrible diseases and disaster on their children and<br>
 children's children. The moral and physical rottenness wrought by<br>
 immorality defy one's imagination.<br>
 <br>
 6:19 <B>{Your body is a temple}</B> <b><i>(\to s&#333;ma hum&#333;n naos estin\)</i></b>. A<br>
 sanctuary as in <!-#-->3:16 which see. Our spirits dwell in our bodies<br>
 and the Holy Spirit dwells in our spirits. Some of the Gnostics<br>
 split hairs between the sins of the body and fellowship with God<br>
 in the spirit. Paul will have none of this subterfuge. One's body<br>
 is the very shrine for the Holy Spirit. In Corinth was the temple<br>
 to Aphrodite in which fornication was regarded as consecration<br>
 instead of desecration. Prostitutes were there as priestesses of<br>
 Aphrodite, to help men worship the goddess by fornication. <B>{Ye<br>
 are not your own}</B> <b><i>(\ouk este heaut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Predicate genitive. Ye do<br>
 not belong to yourselves, even if you could commit fornication<br>
 without personal contamination or self-violation. Christianity<br>
 makes unchastity dishonour in both sexes. There is no double<br>
 standard of morality. Paul's plea here is primarily to men to be<br>
 clean as members of Christ's body.<br>
 <br>
 6:20 <B>{For ye were bought with a price}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;gorasth&#275;te gar tim&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive indicative of \agoraz&#333;\, old verb to buy in<br>
 the marketplace <b><i>(\agora\)</i></b>. With genitive of price. Paul does not<br>
 here state the price as Peter does in <!-#-->1Pe 1:19 <b><i>(the blood of<br>
 Christ)</i></b> and as Jesus does in <!-#-->Mt 20:28 <b><i>(his life a ransom)</i></b>. The<br>
 Corinthians understood his meaning. <B>{Glorify God therefore in<br>
 your body}</B> <b><i>(\doxasate d&#275; ton theon en t&#333;i s&#333;mati hum&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Passionate conclusion to his powerful argument against sexual<br>
 uncleanness. \D&#275;\ is a shortened form of \&#275;d&#275;\ and is an urgent<br>
 inferential particle. See on &#175;Lu 2:15. Paul holds to his high<br>
 ideal of the destiny of the body and urges glorifying God in it.<br>
 Some of the later Christians felt that Paul's words could be<br>
 lightened a bit by adding "and in your spirits which are his,"<br>
 but these words are found only in late MSS. and are clearly not<br>
 genuine. Paul's argument stands four-square for the dignity of<br>
 the body as the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit united to the Lord<br>
 Jesus.<br>
