<p>1:1 <B>{The Book}</B> <b><i>(\biblos\)</i></b>.  There is no article in the Greek, but<br>
 the following genitives make it definite. It is our word Bible<br>
 that is here used, _the_ Book as Sir Walter Scott called it as he<br>
 lay dying. The usual word for book is a diminutive form<br>
 <b><i>(\biblion\)</i></b>, a little book or roll such as we have in <!-#-->Lu 4:17,<br>
 "The roll of the prophet Isaiah." The pieces of papyrus<br>
 <b><i>(\papuros\)</i></b>, our paper, were pasted together to make a roll of<br>
 varying lengths according to one's needs. Matthew, of course, is<br>
 not applying the word book to the Old Testament, probably not to<br>
 his own book, but to "the genealogical table of Jesus Christ"<br>
 <b><i>(\biblos genese&#333;s I&#275;sou Christou\)</i></b>, "the birth roll of Jesus<br>
 Christ" Moffatt translates it. We have no means of knowing where<br>
 the writer obtained the data for this genealogy. It differs<br>
 radically from that in <!-#-->Lu 3:23-38. One can only give his own<br>
 theory of the difference. Apparently in Matthew we have the<br>
 actual genealogy of Joseph which would be the legal pedigree of<br>
 Jesus according to Jewish custom. In Luke we apparently have the<br>
 actual genealogy of Mary which would be the real line of Jesus<br>
 which Luke naturally gives as he is writing for the Gentiles.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Jesus Christ}</B>. Both words are used. The first is the name<br>
 <b><i>(\I&#275;sous\)</i></b> given by the angel to Mary <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 1:21)</i></b> which describes<br>
 the mission of the child. The second was originally a verbal<br>
 adjective <b><i>(\christos\)</i></b> meaning anointed from the verb to anoint<br>
 <b><i>(\chri&#333;\)</i></b>. It was used often in the Septuagint as an adjective<br>
 like "the anointed priest" <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ki 2:10)</i></b> and then as a substantive<br>
 to translate the Hebrew word "Messiah" <b><i>(\Messias\)</i></b>. So Andrew<br>
 said to Simon: "We have found the Messiah, which is, being<br>
 interpreted, Christ" <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:41)</i></b>. In the Gospels it is sometimes<br>
 "the Anointed One," "the Messiah," but finally just a proper name<br>
 as here, Jesus Christ. Paul in his later Epistles usually has it<br>
 "Christ Jesus."<br>
 <br>
 <B>{The Son of David, the son of Abraham}</B> <b><i>(\huiou Daueid huiou<br>
 Abraam\)</i></b>. Matthew proposes to show that Jesus Christ is on the<br>
 human side the son of David, as the Messiah was to be, and the<br>
 son of Abraham, not merely a real Jew and the heir of the<br>
 promises, but the promise made to Abraham. So Matthew begins his<br>
 line with Abraham while Luke traces his line back to Adam. The<br>
 Hebrew and Aramaic often used the word son <b><i>(\b&#275;n\)</i></b> for the<br>
 quality or character, but here the idea is descent. Christians<br>
 are called sons of God because Christ has bestowed this dignity<br>
 upon us <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 8:14; 9:26; Ga 3:26; 4:5-7)</i></b>. Verse 1 is the<br>
 description of the list in verses <!-#-->2-17. The names are given in<br>
 three groups, Abraham to David <b><i>(<!-#-->2-6)</i></b>, David to Babylon Removal<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->6-11)</i></b>, Jechoniah to Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->12-16)</i></b>. The removal to Babylon<br>
 <b><i>(\metoikesias Babul&#333;nos\)</i></b> occurs at the end of verse <!-#-->11, the<br>
 beginning of verse <!-#-->12, and twice in the resume in verse <!-#-->17.<br>
 This great event is used to mark off the two last divisions from<br>
 each other. It is a good illustration of the genitive as the case<br>
 of genus or kind. The Babylon removal could mean either to<br>
 Babylon or from Babylon or, indeed, the removal of Babylon. But<br>
 the readers would know the facts from the Old Testament, the<br>
 removal of the Jews to Babylon. Then verse <!-#-->17 makes a summary<br>
 of the three lists, fourteen in each by counting David twice and<br>
 omitting several, a sort of mnemonic device that is common<br>
 enough. Matthew does not mean to say that there were only<br>
 fourteen in actual genealogy. The names of the women <b><i>(Thamar,<br>
 Rahab, Ruth, Bathsheba the wife of Uriah)</i></b> are likewise not<br>
 counted. But it is a most interesting list.<br>
 <br>
 1:2 <B>{Begat}</B> <b><i>(\egenn&#275;sen\)</i></b>. This word comes, like some of the<br>
 early chapters of Genesis, with regularity through verse 16,<br>
 until the birth of Jesus is reached when there is a sudden<br>
 change. The word itself does not always mean immediate parentage,<br>
 but merely direct descent. In verse <!-#-->16 we have "Joseph the<br>
 husband of Mary, from whom was begotten Jesus who is called<br>
 Christ" <b><i>(\ton I&#333;s&#275;ph ton andra Marias ex h&#275;s egenn&#275;th&#275; I&#275;sous ho<br>
 legomenos Christos\)</i></b>. The article occurs here each time with the<br>
 object of "begat," but not with the subject of the verb to<br>
 distinguish sharply the proper names. In the case of David the<br>
 King <b><i>(<!-#-->1:6)</i></b> and Joseph the husband of Mary <b><i>(<!-#-->1:16)</i></b> the article<br>
 is repeated. The mention of the brethren of Judah <b><i>(<!-#-->1:2)</i></b> and of<br>
 both Phares and Zara <b><i>(<!-#-->1:3)</i></b> may show that Matthew was not<br>
 copying a family pedigree but making his own table. All the Greek<br>
 manuscripts give verse <!-#-->16 as above save the Ferrar Group of<br>
 minuscules which are supported by the Sinaitic Syriac Version.<br>
 Because of this fact Von Soden, whose text Moffatt translates,<br>
 deliberately prints his text "_Jacob begat Jesus_" <b><i>(\I&#333;s&#275;ph de<br>
 egenn&#275;sen I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. But the Sinaitic Syriac gives the Virgin<br>
 Birth of Jesus in Mt <!-#-->1:18-25. Hence it is clear that "begat"<br>
 here in <!-#-->1:16 must merely mean line of descent or the text has<br>
 been tampered with in order to get rid of the Virgin Birth idea,<br>
 but it was left untouched in <!-#-->1:18-25. I have a full discussion<br>
 of the problem in chapter XIV of _Studies in the Text of the New<br>
 Testament_. The evidence as it now stands does not justify<br>
 changing the text of the Greek uncials to suit the Sinaitic<br>
 Syriac. The Virgin Birth of Jesus remains in <!-#-->1:16. The spelling<br>
 of these Hebrew names in English is usually according to the<br>
 Hebrew form, not the Greek. In the Greek itself the Hebrew<br>
 spelling is often observed in violation of the Greek rules for<br>
 the ending of words with no consonants save _n,r,s_. But the list<br>
 is not spelled consistently in the Greek, now like the Hebrew as<br>
 in Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, now like the Greek as in Judah,<br>
 Solomon, Hezekiah, though the Hebrew style prevails.<br>
 <br>
 1:18 <B>{The birth of Jesus Christ}</B> <b><i>(\tou [I&#275;sou] Christou h&#275;<br>
 genesis\)</i></b>. In the Greek Jesus Christ comes before birth as the<br>
 important matter after <!-#-->1:16. It is not certain whether "Jesus"<br>
 is here a part of the text as it is absent in the old Syriac and<br>
 the Old Latin while the Washington Codex has only "Christ." The<br>
 Vatican Codex has "Christ Jesus." But it is plain that the story<br>
 of the birth of Jesus Christ is to be told briefly as follows,<br>
 "on this wise" <b><i>(\hout&#333;s\)</i></b>, the usual Greek idiom. The oldest and<br>
 best manuscripts have the same word genealogy <b><i>(\genesis\)</i></b> used in<br>
 <!-#-->1:1, not the word for birth <b><i>(begotten)</i></b> as in <!-#-->1:16<br>
 <b><i>(\genn&#275;sis\)</i></b>. "It is in fact the word Genesis. The evangelist is<br>
 about to describe, not the genesis of the heaven and the earth,<br>
 but the genesis of Him who made the heaven and the earth, and who<br>
 will yet make a new heaven and a new earth" <b><i>(Morison)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Betrothed to Joseph}</B> <b><i>(\Mn&#275;steutheis&#275;s t&#333;i I&#333;s&#275;ph\)</i></b>. Matthew<br>
 proceeds to explain his statement in <!-#-->1:16 which implied that<br>
 Joseph, though the legal father of Jesus in the royal line, was<br>
 not the actual father of Mary's Son. Betrothal with the Jews was<br>
 a serious matter, not lightly entered into and not lightly<br>
 broken. The man who betrothed a maiden was legally husband <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge<br>
 29:21; De 22:23f.)</i></b> and "an informal cancelling of betrothal was<br>
 impossible" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. Though they did not live together as<br>
 husband and wife till actual marriage, breach of faithfulness on<br>
 the part of the betrothed was treated as adultery and punished<br>
 with death. _The New Testament in Braid Scots_ actually has<br>
 "mairry't till Joseph" for "betrothed to Joseph." Matthew uses<br>
 the genitive absolute construction here, a very common Greek<br>
 idiom.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Of the Holy Ghost}</B> <b><i>(\ek pneumatos hagiou\)</i></b>. The discovery that<br>
 Mary was pregnant was inevitable and it is plain that she had not<br>
 told Joseph. She "was found with child" <b><i>(\heureth&#275; en gastri<br>
 echousa\)</i></b>. This way of putting it, the usual Greek idiom, plainly<br>
 shows that it was the discovery that shocked Joseph. He did not<br>
 as yet know what Matthew plainly asserts that the Holy Ghost, not<br>
 Joseph and not any man, was responsible for the pregnancy of<br>
 Mary. The problem of the Virgin Birth of Jesus has been a<br>
 disturbing fact to some through all the ages and is today to<br>
 those who do not believe in the pre-existence of Christ, the Son<br>
 of God, before his Incarnation on earth. This is the primal fact<br>
 about the Birth of Christ. The Incarnation of Christ is clearly<br>
 stated by Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 8:9; Php 2:5-11; and involved in <!-#-->Col<br>
 1:15-19)</i></b> and by John <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:14; 17:5)</i></b>. If one frankly admits<br>
 the actual pre-existence of Christ and the real Incarnation, he<br>
 has taken the longest and most difficult step in the matter of<br>
 the supernatural Birth of Christ. That being true, no merely<br>
 human birth without the supernatural element can possibly explain<br>
 the facts. Incarnation is far more than the Indwelling of God by<br>
 the Holy Spirit in the human heart. To admit real incarnation and<br>
 also full human birth, both father and mother, creates a greater<br>
 difficulty than to admit the Virgin Birth of Jesus begotten by<br>
 the Holy Spirit, as Matthew here says, and born of the Virgin<br>
 Mary. It is true that only Matthew and Luke tell the story of the<br>
 supernatural birth of Jesus, though <!-#-->Joh 1:14 seems to refer to<br>
 it. Mark has nothing whatever concerning the birth and childhood<br>
 of Jesus and so cannot be used as a witness on the subject. Both<br>
 Matthew and Luke present the birth of Jesus as not according to<br>
 ordinary human birth. Jesus had no human father. There is such a<br>
 thing in nature as parthenogenesis in the lower orders of life.<br>
 But that scientific fact has no bearing here. We see here God<br>
 sending his Son into the world to be the world's Saviour and he<br>
 gave him a human mother, but not a human father so that Jesus<br>
 Christ is both Son of God and Son of Man, the God Man. Matthew<br>
 tells the story of the birth of Jesus from the standpoint of<br>
 Joseph as Luke gives it from the standpoint of Mary. The two<br>
 narratives harmonize with each other. One credits these most<br>
 wonderful of all birth narratives according as he believes in the<br>
 love and power of Almighty God to do what he wills. There is no<br>
 miracle with God who has all power and all knowledge. The laws of<br>
 nature are simply the expression of God's will, but he has not<br>
 revealed all his will in the laws that we discover. God is<br>
 Spirit. He is Person. He holds in his own power all life. <!-#-->Joh<br>
 3:16 is called the Little Gospel because it puts briefly the<br>
 love of God for men in sending his own Son to live and die for<br>
 us.<br>
 <br>
 1:19 <B>{A Righteous Man}</B> <b><i>(\dikaios\)</i></b>. Or just, not benignant or<br>
 merciful. The same adjective is used of Zacharias and Elizabeth<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:6)</i></b> and Simeon <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:25)</i></b>. "An upright man," the _Braid<br>
 Scots_ has it. He had the Jewish conscientiousness for the<br>
 observance of the law which would have been death by stoning <b><i>(<!-#-->De<br>
 22:23)</i></b>. Though Joseph was upright, he would not do that. "As a<br>
 good Jew he would have shown his zeal if he had branded her with<br>
 public disgrace" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. <B>{And yet not willing}</B> <b><i>(\kai m&#275;<br>
 thel&#333;n\)</i></b>. So we must understand \kai\ here, "and yet." Matthew<br>
 makes a distinction here between "willing" <b><i>(\thel&#333;n\)</i></b> and<br>
 "wishing" <b><i>(\eboul&#275;th&#275;\)</i></b>, that between purpose <b><i>(\thel&#333;\)</i></b> and<br>
 desire <b><i>(\boulomai\)</i></b> a distinction not always drawn, though<br>
 present here. It was not his purpose to "make her a public<br>
 example" <b><i>(\deigmatisai\)</i></b>, from the root <b><i>(\deiknumi\ to show)</i></b>, a<br>
 rare word <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 2:15)</i></b>. The Latin Vulgate has it _traducere_, the<br>
 Old Latin _divulgare_, Wycliff _pupplische_ <b><i>(publish)</i></b>, Tyndale<br>
 _defame_,  Moffatt _disgrace_, Braid Scots "Be i the mooth o' the<br>
 public." The substantive <b><i>(\deigmatismos\)</i></b> occurs on the Rosetta<br>
 Stone in the sense of "verification." There are a few instances<br>
 of the verb in the papyri though the meaning is not clear<br>
 <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan's _Vocabulary_)</i></b>. The compound form appears<br>
 <b><i>(\paradeigmatiz&#333;\)</i></b> in <!-#-->Heb 6:6 and there are earlier instances<br>
 of this compound than of the uncompounded, curiously enough. But<br>
 new examples of the simple verb, like the substantive, may yet be<br>
 found. The papyri examples mean to furnish a sample <b><i>(P Tebt.<br>
 5.75)</i></b>, to make trial of <b><i>(P Ryl. I. 28.32)</i></b>. The substantive means<br>
 exposure in <b><i>(P Ryl. I. 28.70)</i></b>. At any rate it is clear that<br>
 Joseph "was minded to put her away privily." He could give her a<br>
 bill of divorcement <b><i>(\apolusai\)</i></b>, the \g&#275;t\ laid down in the<br>
 Mishna, without a public trial. He had to give her the writ<br>
 <b><i>(\g&#275;t\)</i></b> and pay the fine <b><i>(<!-#-->De 24:1)</i></b>. So he proposed to do this<br>
 privately <b><i>(\lathrai\)</i></b> to avoid all the scandal possible. One is<br>
 obliged to respect and sympathize with the motives of Joseph for<br>
 he evidently loved Mary and was appalled to find her untrue to<br>
 him as he supposed. It is impossible to think of Joseph as the<br>
 actual father of Jesus according to the narrative of Matthew<br>
 without saying that Matthew has tried by legend to cover up the<br>
 illegitimate birth of Jesus. The Talmud openly charges this sin<br>
 against Mary. Joseph had "a short but tragic struggle between his<br>
 legal conscience and his love" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:20 <B>{An angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aggelos kuriou kat' onar ephan&#275; aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. This expression<br>
 <b><i>(\aggelos kuriou\)</i></b> is without the article in the New Testament<br>
 except when, as in <!-#-->1:24, there is reference to the angel<br>
 previously mentioned. Sometimes in the Old Testament Jehovah<br>
 Himself is represented by this phrase. Surely Joseph needed God's<br>
 help if ever man did. If Jesus was really God's Son, Joseph was<br>
 entitled to know this supreme fact that he might be just to both<br>
 Mary and her Child. It was in a dream, but the message was<br>
 distinct and decisive for Joseph. He is called "Son of David" as<br>
 had been shown by Matthew in <!-#-->Mt 1:16. Mary is called his "wife"<br>
 <b><i>(\t&#275;n gunaika sou\)</i></b>. He is told "not to become afraid"<br>
 <b><i>(ingressive first aorist passive subjunctive in prohibition), (\m&#275;<br>
 phob&#275;th&#275;is\)</i></b>, "to take to his side" <b><i>(\paralabein\, ingressive<br>
 aorist active infinitive)</i></b> her whom he had planned<br>
 <b><i>(\enthum&#275;thentos\, genitive absolute again, from \en\ and<br>
 \thumos\)</i></b> to send away with a writ of divorce. He had pondered<br>
 and had planned as best he knew, but now God had called a halt<br>
 and he had to decide whether he was willing to shelter Mary by<br>
 marrying her and, if necessary, take upon himself whatever stigma<br>
 might attach to her. Joseph was told that the child was begotten<br>
 of the Holy Spirit and thus that Mary was innocent of any sin.<br>
 But who would believe it now if he told it of her? Mary knew the<br>
 truth and had not told him because she could not expect him to<br>
 believe it.<br>
 <br>
 1:21 <B>{Thou shalt call his name Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\Kalesies to onoma autou<br>
 I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. The rabbis named six whose names were given before<br>
 birth: "Isaac, Ishmael, Moses, Solomon, Josiah, and the name of<br>
 the Messiah, whom may the Holy One, blessed be His name, bring in<br>
 our day." The angel puts it up to Joseph as the putative father<br>
 to name the child. "Jesus is the same as Joshua, a contraction of<br>
 Jehoshuah <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 13:16; 1Ch 7:27)</i></b>, signifying in Hebrew, 'Jehovah<br>
 is helper,' or 'Help of Jehovah'" <b><i>(Broadus)</i></b>. So Jesus is the<br>
 Greek form of Joshua <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 4:8)</i></b>. He is another Joshua to lead<br>
 the true people of God into the Promised Land. The name itself<br>
 was common enough as Josephus shows. Jehovah is Salvation as seen<br>
 in Joshua for the Hebrews and in Jesus for all believers. "The<br>
 meaning of the name, therefore, finds expression in the title<br>
 _Saviour_ applied to our Lord <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:47; 2:11; Joh 4:42)</i></b>"<br>
 <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. He will save <b><i>(\s&#333;sei\)</i></b> his people from their sins and<br>
 so be their Saviour <b><i>(\S&#333;t&#275;r\)</i></b>. He will be prophet, priest, and<br>
 king, but "Saviour" sums it all up in one word. The explanation<br>
 is carried out in the promise, "for he is the one who <b><i>(\autos\)</i></b><br>
 will save <b><i>(\s&#333;sei\ with a play on the name Jesus)</i></b> his people from<br>
 their sins." Paul will later explain that by the covenant people,<br>
 the children of promise, God means the spiritual Israel, all who<br>
 believe whether Jews or Gentiles. This wonderful word touches the<br>
 very heart of the mission and message of the Messiah. Jesus<br>
 himself will show that the kingdom of heaven includes all those<br>
 and only those who have the reign of God in their hearts and<br>
 lives. <B>{From their sins}</B> <b><i>(\apo t&#333;n hamarti&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Both sins<br>
 of omission and of commission. The substantive <b><i>(\hamartia\)</i></b> is<br>
 from the verb <b><i>(\hamartanein\)</i></b> and means missing the mark as with<br>
 an arrow. How often the best of us fall short and fail to score.<br>
 Jesus will save us away from <b><i>(\apo\)</i></b> as well as out of <b><i>(\ex\)</i></b> our<br>
 sins. They will be cast into oblivion and he will cover them up<br>
 out of sight.<br>
 <br>
 1:22 <B>{That it may be fulfilled}</B> <b><i>(\hina pl&#275;r&#333;th&#275;i\)</i></b>. Alford says<br>
 that "it is impossible to interpret \hina\ in any other sense<br>
 than in order that." That was the old notion, but modern<br>
 grammarians recognize the non-final use of this particle in the<br>
 _Koin&#275;_ and even the consecutive like the Latin _ut_. Some even<br>
 argue for a causal use. If the context called for result, one<br>
 need not hesitate to say so as in <!-#-->Mr 11:28; Joh 9:36; 1Jo 1:9;<br>
 Re 9:20; 13:13. See discussion in my _Grammar of the Greek New<br>
 Testament in the Light of Historical Research_, pp. 997-9. All<br>
 the same it is purpose here, God's purpose, Matthew reports the<br>
 angel as saying, spoken "by <b><i>(\hupo\, immediate agent)</i></b> the Lord<br>
 through <b><i>(\dia\, intermediate agent)</i></b> the prophet." <B>{"All this has<br>
 happened"}</B> <b><i>(\touto de holon gegonen\, present perfect<br>
 indicative)</i></b>, stands on record as historical fact. But the Virgin<br>
 Birth of Jesus is not due to this interpretation of <!-#-->Isa 7:14.<br>
 It is not necessary to maintain <b><i>(Broadus)</i></b> that Isaiah himself saw<br>
 anything more in his prophecy than that a woman then a virgin,<br>
 would bear a son and that in the course of a few years Ahaz would<br>
 be delivered from the king of Syria and Israel by the coming of<br>
 the Assyrians. This historical illustration finds its richest<br>
 fulfilment in the birth of Jesus from Mary. "Words of themselves<br>
 are empty. They are useful only as vessels to convey things from<br>
 mind to mind" <b><i>(Morison)</i></b>. The Hebrew word for young woman is<br>
 translated by virgin <b><i>(\parthenos\)</i></b>, but it is not necessary to<br>
 conclude that Isaiah himself contemplated the supernatural birth<br>
 of Jesus. We do not have to say that the idea of the Virgin Birth<br>
 of Jesus came from Jewish sources. Certainly it did not come from<br>
 the pagan myths so foreign to this environment, atmosphere and<br>
 spirit. It is far simpler to admit the supernatural fact than try<br>
 to explain the invention of the idea as a myth to justify the<br>
 deification of Jesus. The birth, life, and death of Jesus throw a<br>
 flood of light on the Old Testament narrative and prophecies for<br>
 the early Christians. In Matthew and John in particular we often<br>
 see "that the events of Christ's life were divinely ordered for<br>
 the express purpose of fulfilling the Old Testament" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 See <!-#-->Mt 2:15,23; 4:14-17; 8:17; 12:17-21; 13:25; 21:4f.; Joh<br>
 12:38f.; 13:18; 19:24,28,36f.<br>
 <br>
 1:23 <B>{They shall call}</B> <b><i>(\kalesousin\)</i></b>. Men, people, will call his<br>
 name Immanuel, God with us. "The interest of the evangelist, as<br>
 of all New Testament writers, in prophecy, was purely religious"<br>
 <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. But surely the language of Isaiah has had marvellous<br>
 illustration in the Incarnation of Christ. This is Matthew's<br>
 explanation of the meaning of Immanuel, a descriptive appellation<br>
 of Jesus Christ and more than a mere motto designation. God's<br>
 help, Jesus=the Help of God, is thus seen. One day Jesus will say<br>
 to Philip: "He that has seen me has seen the Father" <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 14:9)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:24 <B>{Took unto him his wife}</B> <b><i>(\parelaben t&#275;n gunaika autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 The angel had told him not to be afraid to "take to his side"<br>
 Mary his wife <b><i>(<!-#-->1:20)</i></b>. So when he awoke from his sleep he<br>
 promptly obeyed the angel and "took his wife home" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>. One<br>
 can only imagine the relief and joy of Mary when Joseph nobly<br>
 rose to his high duty toward her. I have tried to sketch Mary's<br>
 problems in _Mary the Mother of Jesus: Her Problems and Her<br>
 Glory._<br>
 <br>
 1:25 <B>{And knew her not}</B> <b><i>(\kai ouk egin&#333;sken aut&#275;n\)</i></b>. Note the<br>
 imperfect tense, continuous or linear action. Joseph lived in<br>
 continence with Mary till the birth of Jesus. Matthew does not<br>
 say that Mary bore no other children than Jesus. "Her firstborn"<br>
 is not genuine here, but is a part of the text in <!-#-->Lu 2:7. The<br>
 perpetual virginity of Mary is not taught here. Jesus had<br>
 brothers and sisters and the natural meaning is that they were<br>
 younger children of Joseph and Mary and not children of Joseph by<br>
 a previous marriage. So Joseph "called his name Jesus" as the<br>
 angel had directed and the child was born in wedlock. Joseph<br>
 showed that he was an upright man in a most difficult situation.<br>
