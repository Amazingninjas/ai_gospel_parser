<p>17:1 <B>{After six days}</B> <b><i>(\meth' h&#275;mer&#257;s hex\)</i></b>. This could be on the<br>
 sixth day, but as Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:28)</i></b> puts it "about eight days" one<br>
 naturally thinks of a week as the probable time, though it is not<br>
 important. <B>{Taketh with him}</B> <b><i>(\paralambanei\)</i></b>. Literally, <B>{takes<br>
 along}</B>. Note historical present. These three disciples form an<br>
 inner group who have shown more understanding of Jesus. So at<br>
 Gethsemane. <B>{Apart}</B> <b><i>(\kat' idian\)</i></b> means "by themselves"<br>
 <b><i>(<B>{alone}</B>, \monous\, Mark has it)</i></b> up <b><i>(\anapherei\)</i></b> into a high<br>
 mountain, probably Mount Hermon again, though we do not really<br>
 know. "The Mount of Transfiguration does not concern geography"<br>
 <b><i>(Holtzmann)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:2 <B>{He was transfigured before them}</B> <b><i>(\metemorph&#333;th&#275; emprosthen<br>
 aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. The word is the same as the metamorphoses <b><i>(cf. Ovid)</i></b> of<br>
 pagan mythology. Luke does not use it. The idea is change<br>
 <b><i>(\meta-\)</i></b> of form <b><i>(\morph&#275;\)</i></b>. It really presents the essence of a<br>
 thing as separate from the \sch&#275;ma\ <b><i>(fashion)</i></b>, the outward<br>
 accident. So in <!-#-->Ro 12:2 Paul uses both verbs,<br>
 \sunschematizesthe\ <b><i>(be not fashioned)</i></b> and \metamorphousthe\ <b><i>(be<br>
 ye transformed in your inner life)</i></b>. So in <!-#-->1Co 7:31 \sch&#275;ma\ is<br>
 used for the fashion of the world while in <!-#-->Mr 16:12 \morph&#275;\ is<br>
 used of the form of Jesus after his resurrection. The false<br>
 apostles are described by \metasch&#275;matisomai\ in <!-#-->2Co 11:13-15.<br>
 In <!-#-->Php 2:6 we have \en morph&#275;i\ used of the Preincarnate state<br>
 of Christ and \morph&#275;n doulou\ of the Incarnate state <b><i>(<!-#-->Php<br>
 2:7)</i></b>, while \sch&#275;mati h&#333;s anthr&#333;pos\ emphasizes his being found<br>
 "in fashion as a man." But it will not do in <!-#-->Mt 17:2 to use the<br>
 English transliteration \metamorph&#333;sis\ because of its pagan<br>
 associations. So the Latin _transfigured_ <b><i>(Vulgate<br>
 _transfiguratus est_)</i></b> is better. "The deeper force of<br>
 \metamorphousthai\ is seen in <!-#-->2Co 3:18 <b><i>(with reference to the<br>
 shining on Moses' face)</i></b>, <!-#-->Ro 12:2" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. The word occurs in<br>
 a second-century papyrus of the pagan gods who are invisible.<br>
 Matthew guards against the pagan idea by adding and explaining<br>
 about the face of Christ "as the sun" and his garments "as the<br>
 light."<br>
 <br>
 17:3 <B>{There appeared}</B> <b><i>(\&#333;phth&#275;\)</i></b>. Singular aorist passive verb<br>
 with Moses <b><i>(to be understood also with Elijah)</i></b>, but the<br>
 participle \sunlalountes\ is plural agreeing with both.<br>
 "Sufficient objectivity is guaranteed by the vision being enjoyed<br>
 by all three" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. The Jewish apocalypses reveal popular<br>
 expectations that Moses and Elijah would reappear. Both had<br>
 mystery connected with their deaths. One represented law, the<br>
 other prophecy, while Jesus represented the gospel <b><i>(grace)</i></b>. They<br>
 spoke of his decease <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:31)</i></b>, the cross, the theme uppermost<br>
 in the mind of Christ and which the disciples did not comprehend.<br>
 Jesus needed comfort and he gets it from fellowship with Moses<br>
 and Elijah.<br>
 <br>
 17:4 <B>{And Peter answered}</B> <b><i>(\apokritheis de ho Petros\)</i></b>. "Peter to<br>
 the front again, but not greatly to his credit" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. It is<br>
 not clear what Peter means by his saying: "It is good for us to<br>
 be here" <b><i>(\kalon estin h&#275;m&#257;s h&#333;de einai\)</i></b>. Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:33)</i></b> adds<br>
 "not knowing what he said," as they "were heavy with sleep." So<br>
 it is not well to take Peter too seriously on this occasion. At<br>
 any rate he makes a definite proposal. <B>{I will make}</B> <b><i>(\pai&#275;s&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 Future indicative though aorist subjunctive has same form.<br>
 <B>{Tabernacles}</B> <b><i>(\sk&#275;nas\)</i></b>, booths. The Feast of Tabernacles was<br>
 not far away. Peter may have meant that they should just stay up<br>
 here on the mountain and not go to Jerusalem for the feast.<br>
 <br>
 17:5 <B>{Overshadowed}</B> <b><i>(\epeskiasen\)</i></b>. They were up in cloud-land<br>
 that swept round and over them. See this verb used of Mary <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 1:35)</i></b> and of Peter's shadow <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 5:15)</i></b>. <B>{This is}</B> <b><i>(\houtos<br>
 estin\)</i></b>. At the baptism <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 3:17)</i></b> these words were addressed to<br>
 Jesus. Here the voice out of the bright cloud speaks to them<br>
 about Jesus. <B>{Hear ye him}</B> <b><i>(\akouete autou\)</i></b>. Even when he speaks<br>
 about his death. A sharp rebuke to Peter for his consolation to<br>
 Jesus about his death.<br>
 <br>
 17:7 <B>{And touched them}</B> <b><i>(\kai hapsamenos aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Tenderness in<br>
 their time of fear.<br>
 <br>
 17:8 <B>{Lifting up their eyes}</B> <b><i>(\eparantes tous ophthalmous<br>
 aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. After the reassuring touch of Jesus and his words of<br>
 cheer. <B>{Jesus only}</B> <b><i>(\I&#275;soun monon\)</i></b>. Moses and Elijah were gone<br>
 in the bright cloud.<br>
 <br>
 17:9 <B>{Until}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s hou\)</i></b>. This conjunction is common with the<br>
 subjunctive for a future event as his Resurrection <b><i>(\egerth&#275;i\)</i></b><br>
 was. Again <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 9:10)</i></b> they were puzzled over his meaning. Jesus<br>
 evidently hopes that this vision of Moses and Elijah and his own<br>
 glory might stand them in good stead at his death.<br>
 <br>
 17:10 <B>{Elijah must first come}</B> <b><i>(\Eleian dei elthein pr&#333;ton\)</i></b>. So<br>
 this piece of theology concerned them more than anything else.<br>
 They had just seen Elijah, but Jesus the Messiah had come before<br>
 Elijah. The scribes used <!-#-->Mal 4:5. Jesus had also spoken again<br>
 of his death <b><i>(resurrection)</i></b>. So they are puzzled.<br>
 <br>
 17:12 <B>{Elijah is come already}</B> <b><i>(\Eleias &#275;d&#275; &#275;lthen\)</i></b>. Thus Jesus<br>
 identifies John the Baptist with the promise in Malachi, though<br>
 not the real Elijah in person which John denied <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:21)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{They knew him not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk epign&#333;san auton\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative of \epigin&#333;sk&#333;\, to recognize. Just as they do not<br>
 know Jesus now <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:26)</i></b>. They killed John as they will Jesus<br>
 the Son of Man.<br>
 <br>
 17:13 <B>{Then understood}</B> <b><i>(\tote sun&#275;kan\)</i></b>. One of the three k<br>
 aorists. It was plain enough even for them. John was Elijah in<br>
 spirit and had prepared the way for the Messiah.<br>
 <br>
 17:15 <B>{Epileptic}</B> <b><i>(\sel&#275;niazetai\)</i></b>. Literally, "moonstruck,"<br>
 "lunatic." The symptoms of epilepsy were supposed to be<br>
 aggravated by the changes of the moon <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->4:24)</i></b>. <B>{He has it<br>
 bad}</B> <b><i>(\kak&#333;s echei\)</i></b> as often in the Synoptic Gospels.<br>
 <br>
 17:17 <B>{Perverse}</B> <b><i>(\diestrammen&#275;\)</i></b>. Distorted, twisted in two,<br>
 corrupt. Perfect passive participle of \diastreph&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 17:20 <B>{Little faith}</B> <b><i>(\oligopistian\)</i></b>. A good translation. It was<br>
 less than "a grain of mustard seed" <b><i>(\kokkon sinape&#333;s\)</i></b>. See<br>
 <!-#-->13:31 for this phrase. They had no miracle faith. Bruce holds<br>
 "this mountain" to be the Mount of Transfiguration to which Jesus<br>
 pointed. Probably so. But it is a parable. Our trouble is always<br>
 with "this mountain" which confronts our path. Note the form<br>
 \metaba\ <b><i>(\meta\ and \b&#275;thi\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:23 <B>{And they were exceeding sorry}</B> <b><i>(\kai elup&#275;th&#275;san<br>
 sphodra\)</i></b>. So they at last understood that he was talking about<br>
 his death and resurrection.<br>
 <br>
 17:24 <B>{They that received the half-shekel}</B> <b><i>(\hoi ta didrachma<br>
 lambanontes\)</i></b>. This temple tax amounted to an Attic drachma or<br>
 the Jewish half-shekel, about one-third of a dollar. Every Jewish<br>
 man twenty years of age and over was expected to pay it for the<br>
 maintenance of the temple. But it was not a compulsory tax like<br>
 that collected by the publicans for the government. "The tax was<br>
 like a voluntary church-rate; no one could be compelled to pay"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. The same Greek word occurs in two Egyptian papyri of<br>
 the first century A.D. for the receipt for the tax for the temple<br>
 of Suchus <b><i>(Milligan and Moulton's _Vocabulary_)</i></b>. This tax for the<br>
 Jerusalem temple was due in the month Adar <b><i>(our March)</i></b> and it was<br>
 now nearly six months overdue. But Jesus and the Twelve had been<br>
 out of Galilee most of this time. Hence the question of the<br>
 tax-collectors. The payment had to be made in the Jewish coin,<br>
 half-shekel. Hence the money-changers did a thriving business in<br>
 charging a small premium for the Jewish coin, amounting to some<br>
 forty-five thousand dollars a year, it is estimated. It is<br>
 significant that they approached Peter rather than Jesus, perhaps<br>
 not wishing to embarrass "Your Teacher," "a roundabout hint that<br>
 the tax was overdue" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Evidently Jesus had been in the<br>
 habit of paying it <b><i>(Peter's)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:25 <B>{Jesus spake first to him}</B> <b><i>(\proephthasen auton ho I&#275;sous<br>
 leg&#333;n\)</i></b>. Here only in the N.T. One example in a papyrus B.C. 161<br>
 <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan, _Vocabulary_)</i></b>. The old idiomatic use of<br>
 \phthan&#333;\ with the participle survives in this example of<br>
 \prophthan&#333;\ in <!-#-->Mt 17:25, meaning to anticipate, to get before<br>
 one in doing a thing. The _Koin&#275;_ uses the infinitive thus with<br>
 \phthan&#333;\ which has come to mean simply to arrive. Here the<br>
 anticipation is made plain by the use of \pro-\. See Robertson's<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 1120. The "prevent" of the Authorized Version was<br>
 the original idea of _praevenire_, to go before, to anticipate.<br>
 Peter felt obliged to take the matter up with Jesus. But the<br>
 Master had observed what was going on and spoke to Peter first.<br>
 <B>{Toll or tribute}</B> <b><i>(\tel&#275; &#275; k&#275;nson\)</i></b>. Customs or wares collected<br>
 by the publicans <b><i>(like \phoros\, <!-#-->Ro 13:7)</i></b> and also the<br>
 capitation tax on persons, indirect and direct taxation. \K&#275;nsos\<br>
 is the Latin _census_, a registration for the purpose of the<br>
 appraisement of property like \h&#275; apograph&#275;\ in <!-#-->Lu 2:2; Ac<br>
 5:37. By this parable Jesus as the Son of God claims exemption<br>
 from the temple tax as the temple of his Father just as royal<br>
 families do not pay taxes, but get tribute from the foreigners or<br>
 aliens, subjects in reality.<br>
 <br>
 17:26 <B>{The sons}</B> <b><i>(\hoi huioi\)</i></b>. Christ, of course, and the<br>
 disciples also in contrast with the Jews. Thus a reply to Peter's<br>
 prompt "Yes." Logically <b><i>(\arage\)</i></b> free from the temple tax, but<br>
 practically not as he proceeds to show.<br>
 <br>
 17:27 <B>{Lest we cause them to stumble}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275; skandalis&#333;men<br>
 autous\)</i></b>. He does not wish to create the impression that he and<br>
 the disciples despise the temple and its worship. Aorist tense<br>
 <b><i>(punctiliar single act)</i></b> here, though some MSS. have present<br>
 subjunctive <b><i>(linear)</i></b>. "A hook" <b><i>(\agkistron\)</i></b>. The only example in<br>
 the N.T. of fishing with a hook. From an unused verb \agkiz&#333;\, to<br>
 angle, and that from \agkos\, a curve <b><i>(so also \agkal&#275;\ the inner<br>
 curve of the arm, <!-#-->Lu 2:38)</i></b>. <B>{First cometh up}</B> <b><i>(\ton anabanta<br>
 pr&#333;ton ichthun\)</i></b>. More correctly, "the first fish that cometh<br>
 up." <B>{A shekel}</B> <b><i>(\stat&#275;ra\)</i></b>. Greek stater = four drachmae, enough<br>
 for two persons to pay the tax. <B>{For me and thee}</B> <b><i>(\anti emou kai<br>
 sou\)</i></b>. Common use of \anti\ in commercial transactions, "in<br>
 exchange for." Here we have a miracle of foreknowledge. Such<br>
 instances have happened. Some try to get rid of the miracle by<br>
 calling it a proverb or by saying that Jesus only meant for Peter<br>
 to sell the fish and thus get the money, a species of nervous<br>
 anxiety to relieve Christ and the Gospel of Matthew from the<br>
 miraculous. "All the attempts have been in vain which were made<br>
 by the older Rationalism to put a non-miraculous meaning into<br>
 these words" <b><i>(B. Weiss)</i></b>. It is not stated that Peter actually<br>
 caught such a fish though that is the natural implication. Why<br>
 provision is thus only made for Peter along with Jesus we do not<br>
 know.<br>
