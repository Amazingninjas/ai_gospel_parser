<p>6:1 <B>{If a man be overtaken}</B> <b><i>(\ean kai prol&#275;mphth&#275;i anthr&#333;pos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Condition of third class, first aorist passive subjunctive of<br>
 \prolamban&#333;\, old verb to take beforehand, to surprise, to<br>
 detect. <B>{Trespass}</B> <b><i>(\parapt&#333;mati\)</i></b>. Literally, a falling aside, a<br>
 slip or lapse in the papyri rather than a wilful sin. In Polybius<br>
 and Diodorus. _Koin&#275;_ word. <B>{Ye which are spiritual}</B> <b><i>(\hoi<br>
 pneumatikoi\)</i></b>. See on &#175;1Co 3:1. The spiritually led <b><i>(<!-#-->5:18)</i></b>,<br>
 the spiritual experts in mending souls. <B>{Restore}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katartizete\)</i></b>. Present active imperative of \katartiz&#333;\, the<br>
 very word used in <!-#-->Mt 4:21 of mending nets, old word to make<br>
 \artios\, fit, to equip thoroughly. <B>{Looking to thyself}</B> <b><i>(\skop&#333;n<br>
 seauton\)</i></b>. Keeping an eye on as in <!-#-->2Co 4:18 like a runner on<br>
 the goal. <B>{Lest thou also be tempted}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; kai su peirasth&#275;is\)</i></b>.<br>
 Negative purpose with first aorist passive subjunctive. Spiritual<br>
 experts <b><i>(preachers in particular)</i></b> need this caution. Satan loves<br>
 a shining mark.<br>
 <br>
 6:2 <B>{Bear ye one another's burdens}</B> <b><i>(\all&#275;l&#333;n ta bar&#275;<br>
 bastazete\)</i></b>. Keep on bearing <b><i>(present active imperative of<br>
 \bastaz&#333;\, old word, used of Jesus bearing his Cross in <!-#-->Joh<br>
 19:17. \Baros\ means weight as in <!-#-->Mt 20:12; 2Co 4:17. It is<br>
 when one's load <b><i>(\phortion\, verse <!-#-->5)</i></b> is about to press one<br>
 down. Then give help in carrying it.)</i></b> <B>{Fulfil}</B> <b><i>(\anapl&#275;r&#333;sate\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active imperative of \anapl&#275;ro&#333;\, to fill up, old<br>
 word, and see on &#175;Mt 23:32; 1Th 2:16; 1Co 14:16. Some MSS. have<br>
 future indicative <b><i>(\anapl&#275;r&#333;sete\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:3 <B>{Something when he is nothing}</B> <b><i>(\ti m&#275;den &#333;n\)</i></b>. Thinks he is<br>
 a big number being nothing at all <b><i>(neuter singular pronouns)</i></b>. He<br>
 is really zero. <B>{He deceiveth himself}</B> <b><i>(\phrenapat&#257;i heauton\)</i></b>.<br>
 Late compound word <b><i>(\phr&#275;n\, mind, \apata&#333;\, lead astray)</i></b>, leads<br>
 his own mind astray. Here for first time. Afterwards in Galen,<br>
 ecclesiastical and Byzantine writers. He deceives no one else.<br>
 <br>
 6:5 <B>{Each shall bear his own burden}</B> <b><i>(\to idion phortion<br>
 bastasei\)</i></b>. \Phortion\ is old word for ship's cargo <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 27:10)</i></b>.<br>
 Christ calls his \phortion\ light, though he terms those of the<br>
 Pharisees heavy <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 23:4)</i></b>, meant for other people. The terms<br>
 are thus not always kept distinct, though Paul does make a<br>
 distinction here from the \bar&#275;\ in verse <!-#-->2.<br>
 <br>
 6:6 <B>{That is taught}</B> <b><i>(\ho kat&#275;choumenos\)</i></b>. For this late and rare<br>
 verb \kat&#275;che&#333;\, see on &#175;Lu 1:4; Ac 18:25; 1Co 14:19. It occurs<br>
 in the papyri for legal instruction. Here the present passive<br>
 participle retains the accusative of the thing. The active <b><i>(\t&#333;i<br>
 kat&#275;chounti\)</i></b> joined with the passive is interesting as showing<br>
 how early we find paid teachers in the churches. Those who<br>
 receive instruction are called on to "contribute" <b><i>(better than<br>
 "communicate" for \koin&#333;neit&#333;\)</i></b> for the time of the teacher<br>
 <b><i>(Burton)</i></b>. There was a teaching class thus early <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 5:12; 1Co<br>
 12:28; Eph 4:11; 1Th 5:17)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:7 <B>{Be not deceived}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; plan&#257;sthe\)</i></b>. Present passive<br>
 imperative with \m&#275;\, "stop being led astray" <b><i>(\plana&#333;\, common<br>
 verb to wander, to lead astray as in <!-#-->Mt 24:4f.)</i></b>. <B>{God is not<br>
 mocked}</B> <b><i>(\ou mukt&#275;rizetai\)</i></b>. This rare verb <b><i>(common in LXX)</i></b><br>
 occurs in Lysias. It comes from \mukt&#275;r\ <b><i>(nose)</i></b> and means to turn<br>
 the nose up at one. That is done towards God, but never without<br>
 punishment, Paul means to say. In particular, he means "an<br>
 evasion of his laws which men think to accomplish, but, in fact,<br>
 cannot" <b><i>(Burton)</i></b>. <B>{Whatsoever a man soweth}</B> <b><i>(\ho ean speir&#275;i<br>
 anthr&#333;pos\)</i></b>. Indefinite relative clause with \ean\ and the active<br>
 subjunctive <b><i>(either aorist or present, form same here)</i></b>. One of<br>
 the most frequent of ancient proverbs <b><i>(<!-#-->Job 4:8; Arist., _Rhet_.<br>
 iii. 3)</i></b>. Already in <!-#-->2Co 9:6. Same point in <!-#-->Mt 7:16; Mr 4:26f.<br>
 <B>{That}</B> <b><i>(\touto\)</i></b>. That very thing, not something different.<br>
 <B>{Reap}</B> <b><i>(\therisei\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 6:26 for this old verb.<br>
 <br>
 6:8 <B>{Corruption}</B> <b><i>(\phthoran\)</i></b>. For this old word from \phtheir&#333;\,<br>
 see on &#175;1Co 15:42. The precise meaning turns on the context,<br>
 here plainly the physical and moral decay or rottenness that<br>
 follows sins of the flesh as all men know. Nature writes in one's<br>
 body the penalty of sin as every doctor knows. <B>{Eternal life}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\z&#333;&#275;n ai&#333;nion\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 25:46 for this interesting phrase<br>
 so common in the Johannine writings. Plato used \ai&#333;nios\ for<br>
 perpetual. See also <!-#-->2Th 1:9. It comes as nearly meaning<br>
 "eternal" as the Greek can express that idea.<br>
 <br>
 6:9 <B>{Let us not be weary in well-doing}</B> <b><i>(\to kalon poiountes m&#275;<br>
 enkak&#333;men\)</i></b>. Volitive present active subjunctive of \enkake&#333;\ on<br>
 which see <!-#-->Lu 18:1; 2Th 3:13; 2Co 4:1,16 <b><i>(\en, kakos\, evil)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "Let us not keep on giving in to evil while doing the<br>
 good." It is curious how prone we are to give in and to give out<br>
 in doing the good which somehow becomes prosy or insipid to us.<br>
 <B>{In due season}</B> <b><i>(\kair&#333;i idi&#333;i\)</i></b>. Locative case, "at its proper<br>
 season" <b><i>(harvest time)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->1Ti 2:6; 6:15 <b><i>(plural)</i></b>. <B>{If we<br>
 faint not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; ekluomenoi\)</i></b>. Present passive participle<br>
 <b><i>(conditional)</i></b> with \m&#275;\. Cf. \eklu&#333;\, old verb to loosen out.<br>
 Literally, "not loosened out," relaxed, exhausted as a result of<br>
 giving in to evil <b><i>(\enkak&#333;men\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:10 <B>{As we have opportunity}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s kairon ech&#333;men\)</i></b>. Indefinite<br>
 comparative clause <b><i>(present subjunctive without \an\)</i></b>. "As we<br>
 have occasion at any time." <B>{Let us work that which is good}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ergaz&#333;metha to agathon\)</i></b>. Volitive present middle subjunctive<br>
 of \ergazomai\, "Let us keep on working the good deed." <B>{Of the<br>
 household of faith}</B> <b><i>(\tous oikeious t&#275;s piste&#333;s\)</i></b>. For the<br>
 obvious reason that they belong to the same family with necessary<br>
 responsibility.<br>
 <br>
 6:11 <B>{With how large letters}</B> <b><i>(\p&#275;likois grammasin\)</i></b>. Paul now<br>
 takes the pen from the amanuensis <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ro 16:22)</i></b> and writes the<br>
 rest of the Epistle <b><i>(verses <!-#-->11-18)</i></b> himself instead of the mere<br>
 farewell greeting <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 3:17; 1Co 16:21; Col 4:18)</i></b>. But what<br>
 does he mean by "with how large letters"? Certainly not "how<br>
 large a letter." It has been suggested that he employed large<br>
 letters because of defective eyesight or because he could only<br>
 write ill-formed letters because of his poor handwriting <b><i>(like<br>
 the print letters of children)</i></b> or because he wished to call<br>
 particular attention to this closing paragraph by placarding it<br>
 in big letters <b><i>(Ramsay)</i></b>. This latter is the most likely reason.<br>
 Deissmann, <b><i>(_St. Paul_, p. 51)</i></b> argues that artisans write clumsy<br>
 letters, yes, and scholars also. Milligan <b><i>(_Documents_, p. 24;<br>
 _Vocabulary_, etc.)</i></b> suggests the contrast seen in papyri often<br>
 between the neat hand of the scribe and the big sprawling hand of<br>
 the signature. <B>{I have written}</B> <b><i>(\egrapsa\)</i></b>. Epistolary aorist.<br>
 <B>{With mine own hand}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i em&#275;i cheiri\)</i></b>. Instrumental case as in<br>
 <!-#-->1Co 16:21.<br>
 <br>
 6:12 <B>{To make a fair show}</B> <b><i>(\eupros&#333;p&#275;sai\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 infinitive of \eupros&#333;pe&#333;\, late verb from \eupros&#333;pos\, fair of<br>
 face <b><i>(\eu, pros&#333;pon\)</i></b>. Here only in N.T., but one example in<br>
 papyri <b><i>(Tebt. I. 19 12 B.C. 114)</i></b> which shows what may happen to<br>
 any of our N.T. words not yet found elsewhere. It is in<br>
 Chrysostom and later writers. <B>{They compel}</B> <b><i>(\anagkazousin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Conative present active indicative, "they try to compel." <B>{For<br>
 the cross of Christ}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i staur&#333;i tou Christou\)</i></b>. Instrumental<br>
 case <b><i>(causal use, Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 532)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->2Co 2:13.<br>
 "For professing the cross of Christ" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:13 <B>{They who receive circumcision}</B> <b><i>(\hoi peritemnomenoi\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present causative middle of \peritemn&#333;\, those who are having<br>
 themselves circumcised. Some MSS. read \hoi peritetm&#275;menoi\)</i></b>,<br>
 "they who have been circumcised" <b><i>(perfect passive participle)</i></b>.<br>
 Probably the present <b><i>(\peritemnomenoi\)</i></b> is correct as the harder<br>
 reading.<br>
 <br>
 6:14 <B>{Far be it from me}</B> <b><i>(\emoi m&#275; genoito\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 middle optative of \ginomai\ in a negative <b><i>(\m&#275;\)</i></b> wish about the<br>
 future with dative case: "May it not happen to me." See <!-#-->2:17.<br>
 The infinitive \kauch&#257;sthai\ <b><i>(to glory)</i></b> is the subject of<br>
 \genoito\ as is common in the LXX, though not elsewhere in the<br>
 N.T. <B>{Hath been crucified unto me}</B> <b><i>(\emoi estaur&#333;tai\)</i></b>. Perfect<br>
 passive indicative of \stauro&#333;\, stands crucified, with the<br>
 ethical dative again <b><i>(\emoi\)</i></b>. This is one of the great sayings<br>
 of Paul concerning his relation to Christ and the world in<br>
 contrast with the Judaizers. Cf. <!-#-->2:19f.; 3:13; 4:4f.; 1Co<br>
 1:23f.; Ro 1:16; 3:21ff.; 4:25; 5:18. <B>{World}</B> <b><i>(\kosmos\)</i></b> has no<br>
 article, but is definite as in <!-#-->2Co 5:19. Paul's old world of<br>
 Jewish descent and environment is dead to him <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 3:3f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:15 <B>{A new creature}</B> <b><i>(\kain&#275; ktisis\)</i></b>. For this phrase see on<br>
 &#175;2Co 5:17.<br>
 <br>
 6:16 <B>{By this rule}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i kanoni tout&#333;i\)</i></b>. For \kan&#333;n\, see on<br>
 &#175;2Co 10:13,15f.<br>
 <br>
 6:17 <B>{From henceforth}</B> <b><i>(\tou loipou\)</i></b>. Usually \to loipon\, the<br>
 accusative of general reference, "as for the rest" <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 3:1;<br>
 4:8)</i></b>. The genitive case <b><i>(as here and <!-#-->Eph 6:10)</i></b> means "in<br>
 respect of the remaining time." <B>{The marks of Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\ta<br>
 stigmata tou I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. Old word from \stiz&#333;\, to prick, to stick,<br>
 to sting. Slaves had the names or stamp of their owners on their<br>
 bodies. It was sometimes done for soldiers also. There were<br>
 devotees also who stamped upon their bodies the names of the gods<br>
 whom they worshipped. Today in a round-up cattle are given the<br>
 owner's mark. Paul gloried in being the slave of Jesus Christ.<br>
 This is probably the image in Paul's mind since he bore in his<br>
 body brandmarks of suffering for Christ received in many places<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 6:4-6; 11:23ff.)</i></b>, probably actual scars from the<br>
 scourgings <b><i>(thirty-nine lashes at a time)</i></b>. If for no other<br>
 reason, listen to me by reason of these scars for Christ and "let<br>
 no one keep on furnishing trouble to me."<br>
 <br>
 6:18 The farewell salutation is much briefer than that in <!-#-->2Co<br>
 13:13, but identical with that in <!-#-->Phm 1:25. He calls them<br>
 "brethren" <b><i>(\adelphoi\)</i></b> in spite of the sharp things spoken to<br>
 them.<br>
