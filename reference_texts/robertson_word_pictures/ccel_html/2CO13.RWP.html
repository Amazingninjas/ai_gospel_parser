<p>13:1 <B>{The third time I am coming}</B> <b><i>(\triton erchomai\)</i></b>. Either the<br>
 third that he had planned to come or that he had been twice. The<br>
 warning is made by quoting <!-#-->De 19:15.<br>
 <br>
 13:2 <B>{As when I was present the second time}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s par&#333;n to<br>
 deuteron\)</i></b>. This translation assumes the second visit as already<br>
 made. It is a natural way to take the Greek \h&#333;s par&#333;n\. But<br>
 \h&#333;s\ with \par&#333;n\ can also mean "as if present" the second time<br>
 <b><i>(Authorized Version)</i></b>. Probably "as when" is the more natural<br>
 rendering, but the other cannot be ruled entirely out in view of<br>
 <!-#-->1:15-23. <B>{If I come again}</B> <b><i>(\ean elth&#333; eis to palin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Condition of third class. The use of \palin\ of itself suits the<br>
 idea that Paul had not yet made the second visit as it means<br>
 simply "again" or "back," but in <!-#-->Mt 26:44 we find \palin ek<br>
 tritou\ <b><i>(again a third time)</i></b> and so it is not decisive.<br>
 <br>
 13:3 <B>{A proof of Christ}</B> <b><i>(\dokim&#275;n tou Christou\)</i></b>. He will give<br>
 it to them. "I will not spare." He will show that Christ speaks<br>
 "in me" <b><i>(\en emoi\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:4 <B>{But we shall live with him through the power of God}</B> <b><i>(\alla<br>
 z&#275;somen sun aut&#333;i ek duname&#333;s theou\)</i></b>. So real is Paul's sense of<br>
 his union with Christ.<br>
 <br>
 13:5 <B>{Unless indeed ye be reprobate}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275;ti adokimoi este\)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul challenged his opposers in Corinth to try <b><i>(\peirazete\)</i></b><br>
 themselves, to test <b><i>(\dokimazete\)</i></b> themselves, whether they were<br>
 "in the faith" <b><i>(\en t&#275;i pistei\)</i></b>, a much more vital matter for<br>
 them than trying to prove Paul a heretic. Such tests can be made,<br>
 unless, alas, they are "reprobate" <b><i>(\adokimoi\, the very<br>
 adjective that Paul held up before himself as a dreadful outcome<br>
 to be avoided, <!-#-->1Co 9:27)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:6 <B>{That ye shall know}</B> <b><i>(\hoti epign&#333;sesthe\)</i></b>. Such a testing<br>
 of themselves will give them full knowledge that Paul is not<br>
 <B>{reprobate}</B> <b><i>(\adokimos\)</i></b>. The best way for vacillating Christians<br>
 to stop it is to draw close to Christ.<br>
 <br>
 13:7 <B>{Though we be as reprobate}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meis de h&#333;s adokimoi &#333;men\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "And that" <b><i>(\hina de\)</i></b>. Paul wishes them to do no<br>
 wrong <b><i>(\kakon m&#275;den\)</i></b>. He has no desire to exercise his apostolic<br>
 authority and "appear approved" <b><i>(\dokimoi phan&#333;men\, second<br>
 aorist passive subjunctive of \phain&#333;\)</i></b>. He had far rather see<br>
 them do "the noble thing" <b><i>(\to kalon\)</i></b> even if it should make him<br>
 appear disapproved after all that he has said.<br>
 <br>
 13:8 <B>{Against the truth}</B> <b><i>(\kata t&#275;s al&#275;theias\)</i></b>. He means in the<br>
 long run. We can hinder and hold down the truth by evil deeds<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:18)</i></b>, but in the end the truth wins.<br>
 <br>
 13:9 <B>{For we rejoice}</B> <b><i>(\chairomen gar\)</i></b>. Paul had far rather be<br>
 weak in the sense of failing to exercise his apostolic power<br>
 because they did the noble thing. He is no Jonah who lamented<br>
 when Ninevah repented. <B>{Your perfecting}</B> <b><i>(\hum&#333;n katartisin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Late word from \katartiz&#333;\, to fit, to equip <b><i>(see verb in verse<br>
 <!-#-->11)</i></b>. In Plutarch, only here in N.T.<br>
 <br>
 13:10 <B>{That I may not when present deal sharply}</B> <b><i>(\hina par&#333;n<br>
 apotom&#333;s chr&#275;s&#333;mai\)</i></b>. Late adverb from \apotomos\, curt, cut off.<br>
 In N.T. only here and <!-#-->Tit 1:13.<br>
 <br>
 13:12 <B>{With a holy kiss}</B> <b><i>(\en hagi&#333;i phil&#275;mati\)</i></b>. In the Jewish<br>
 synagogues where the sexes were separated, men kissed men, the<br>
 women, women. This apparently was the Christian custom also. It<br>
 is still observed in the Coptic and the Russian churches. It was<br>
 dropped because of charges made against the Christians by the<br>
 pagans. In England in 1250 Archbishop Walter of York introduced a<br>
 "pax-board" which was first kissed by the clergy and then passed<br>
 around. Think of the germ theory of disease and that kissing<br>
 tablet!<br>
 <br>
 13:13 <B>{The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God,<br>
 and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; charis<br>
 tou Kuriou I&#275;sou Christou kai h&#275; agap&#275; tou theou kai h&#275; koin&#333;nia<br>
 tou hagiou pneumatos meta pant&#333;n hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. This benediction is the<br>
 most complete of them all. It presents the persons of the Trinity<br>
 in full form. From <!-#-->2Th 3:17 it appears that Paul wrote the<br>
 greeting or benediction with his own hand. We know from <!-#-->Ro<br>
 15:19 that Paul went round about unto Illyricum before,<br>
 apparently, he came on to Corinth. When he did arrive <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 20:1-3)</i></b> the troubles from the Judaizers had disappeared.<br>
 Probably the leaders left after the coming of Titus and the<br>
 brethren with this Epistle. The reading of it in the church would<br>
 make a stir of no small proportions. But it did the work.<br>
