 <HR>
<p>18:1 <B>{To the end that}</B> <b><i>(\pros to dein\)</i></b>. <B>{With a view to the<br>
 being necessary}</B>, \pros\ and the articular infinitive. The<br>
 impersonal verb \dei\ here is in the infinitive and has another<br>
 infinitive loosely connected with it \proseuchesthai\, to pray.<br>
 <B>{Not to faint}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; enkakein\)</i></b>. Literally, not to give in to evil<br>
 <b><i>(\en, kake&#333;\, from \kakos\, bad or evil)</i></b>, to turn coward, lose<br>
 heart, behave badly. A late verb used several times in the N.T.<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 4:1,16, etc.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:2 Regarded not <b><i>(\m&#275; entrepomenos\)</i></b>. Present middle participle<br>
 of \entrep&#333;\, old verb, to turn one on himself, to shame one, to<br>
 reverence one. This was a "hard-boiled" judge who knew no one as<br>
 his superior. See on &#175;Mt 21:37.<br>
 <br>
 18:3 <B>{Came oft}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rcheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense denotes repetitions,<br>
 no adverb for "oft" in the Greek. <B>{Avenge me of}</B> <b><i>(\ekdik&#275;son me<br>
 apo\)</i></b>. A late verb for doing justice, protecting one from another<br>
 <b><i>(note both \ek\ and \apo\, here)</i></b>. Deissmann <b><i>(_Light from the<br>
 Ancient East_, pp. 420ff.)</i></b> quotes a \st&#275;l&#275;\ of the second century<br>
 B.C. with a prayer for vengeance for a Jewish girl that had been<br>
 murdered which has this very verb \ekdike&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 18:4 <B>{He would not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk &#275;thelen\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense of continued<br>
 refusal. <B>{Though}</B> <b><i>(\ei kai\)</i></b>. Concerning sentence, not \kai ei\<br>
 <b><i>(even if)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:5 <B>{Yet}</B> <b><i>(\ge\)</i></b>. Delicate intensive particle of deep feeling as<br>
 here. <B>{Because this widow troubleth me}</B> <b><i>(\dia to parechein moi<br>
 kopon t&#275;n ch&#275;ran taut&#275;n\)</i></b>. Literally, because of the furnishing<br>
 me trouble as to this widow <b><i>(accusative of general reference with<br>
 the articular infinitive)</i></b>. <B>{Lest she wear me out}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275;<br>
 hup&#333;piaz&#275;i me\)</i></b>. Some take it that the judge is actually afraid<br>
 that the widow may come and assault him, literally beat him under<br>
 the eye. That idea would be best expressed here by the aorist<br>
 tense.<br>
 <br>
 18:6 <B>{The unrighteous judge}</B> <b><i>(\ho krit&#275;s t&#275;s adikias\)</i></b>. The judge<br>
 of unrighteousness <b><i>(marked by unrighteousness)</i></b>, as in <!-#-->16:8 we<br>
 have "the steward of unrighteousness," the same idiom.<br>
 <br>
 18:7 <B>{And he is longsuffering}</B> <b><i>(\makrothumei\)</i></b>. This present<br>
 active indicative comes in awkwardly after the aorist subjunctive<br>
 \poi&#275;s&#275;i\ after \ou m&#275;\, but this part of the question is<br>
 positive. Probably \kai\ here means "and yet" as so often <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 9:30; 16:32, etc.)</i></b>. God delays taking vengeance on behalf of his<br>
 people, not through indifference, but through patient<br>
 forbearance.<br>
 <br>
 18:8 <B>{Howbeit}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;n\)</i></b>. It is not clear whether this sentence is<br>
 also a question or a positive statement. There is no way to<br>
 decide. Either will make sense though not quite the same sense.<br>
 The use of \&#257;ra\ before \heur&#275;sei\ seems to indicate a question<br>
 expecting a negative answer as in <!-#-->Ac 8:30; Ro 14:19. But here<br>
 \&#257;ra\ comes in the middle of the sentence instead of near the<br>
 beginning, an unusual position for either inferential \&#257;ra\ or<br>
 interrogative \&#257;ra\. On the whole the interrogative \&#257;ra\ is<br>
 probably correct, meaning to question if the Son will find a<br>
 persistence of faith like that of the widow.<br>
 <br>
 18:9 <B>{Set all others at naught}</B> <b><i>(\exouthenountas tous loipous\)</i></b>.<br>
 A late verb \exouthene&#333;\, like \oudene&#333;\, from \outhen\<br>
 <b><i>(\ouden\)</i></b>, to consider or treat as nothing. In LXX and chiefly in<br>
 Luke and Paul in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 18:10 <B>{Stood}</B> <b><i>(\statheis\)</i></b>. First aorist passive participle of<br>
 \hist&#275;mi\. Struck an attitude ostentatiously where he could be<br>
 seen. Standing was the common Jewish posture in prayer <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 6:5;<br>
 Mr 11:25)</i></b>. <B>{Prayed thus}</B> <b><i>(\tauta pros&#275;ucheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 middle, was praying these things <b><i>(given following)</i></b>. <B>{With<br>
 himself}</B> <b><i>(\pros heauton\)</i></b>. A soliloquy with his own soul, a<br>
 complacent recital of his own virtues for his own<br>
 self-satisfaction, not fellowship with God, though he addresses<br>
 God. <B>{I thank thee}</B> <b><i>(\eucharist&#333; soi\)</i></b>. But his gratitude to God<br>
 is for his own virtues, not for God's mercies to him. One of the<br>
 rabbis offers a prayer like this of gratitude that he was in a<br>
 class by himself because he was a Jew and not a Gentile, because<br>
 he was a Pharisee and not of the _am-haaretz_ or common people,<br>
 because he was a man and not a woman. <B>{Extortioners}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\harpages\)</i></b>. An old word, \harpax\ from same root as \harpaz&#333;\,<br>
 to plunder. An adjective of only one gender, used of robbers and<br>
 plunderers, grafters, like the publicans <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 3:13)</i></b>, whether<br>
 wolves <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 7:15)</i></b> or men <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 5:19f.)</i></b>. The Pharisee cites the<br>
 crimes of which he is not guilty. <B>{Or even}</B> <b><i>(\&#275; kai\)</i></b>. As the<br>
 climax of iniquity <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>, he points to "this publican."<br>
 Zaccheus will admit robbery <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 19:8)</i></b>. <B>{God}</B> <b><i>(\ho theos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Nominative form with the article as common with the vocative use<br>
 of \theos\ <b><i>(so verse <!-#-->13; Joh 20:28)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:12 <B>{Twice in the week}</B> <b><i>(\dis tou sabbatou\)</i></b>. One fast a year<br>
 was required by the law <b><i>(<!-#-->Le 16:29; Nu 29:7)</i></b>. The Pharisees<br>
 added others, twice a week between passover and pentecost, and<br>
 between tabernacles and dedication of the temple. <B>{I get}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kt&#333;mai\)</i></b>. Present middle indicative, not perfect middle<br>
 \kekt&#275;mai\ <b><i>(I possess)</i></b>. He gave a tithe of his income, not of his<br>
 property.<br>
 <br>
 18:13 <B>{Standing afar off}</B> <b><i>(\makrothen hest&#333;s\)</i></b>. Second perfect<br>
 active participle of \hist&#275;mi\, intransitive like \statheis\<br>
 above. But no ostentation as with the Pharisee in verse <!-#-->11. At<br>
 a distance from the Pharisee, not from the sanctuary. <B>{Would not<br>
 lift}</B> <b><i>(\ouk &#275;thelen oude ep&#257;rai\)</i></b>. Negatives <b><i>(double)</i></b> imperfect<br>
 of <B>{thel&#333;}</B>, was not willing even to lift up, refused to lift<br>
 <b><i>(\ep&#257;rai\, first aorist active infinitive of the liquid compound<br>
 verb, \ep-air&#333;\)</i></b>. Smote <b><i>(\etupte\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \tupt&#333;\,<br>
 old verb, kept on smiting or beating. Worshippers usually lifted<br>
 up their closed eyes to God. <B>{Be merciful}</B> <b><i>(\hilasth&#275;ti\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive imperative of \hilaskomai\, an old verb, found<br>
 also in LXX and inscriptions <b><i>(\exhilaskomai\, Deissmann, _Bible<br>
 Studies_, p. 224)</i></b>. <B>{A sinner}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i hamart&#333;l&#333;i\)</i></b>. The sinner, not<br>
 a sinner. It is curious how modern scholars ignore this Greek<br>
 article. The main point in the contrast lies in this article. The<br>
 Pharisee thought of others as sinners. The publican thinks of<br>
 himself alone as the sinner, not of others at all.<br>
 <br>
 18:14 <B>{This man}</B> <b><i>(\houtos\)</i></b>. This despised publican referred to<br>
 contemptuously in verse <!-#-->11 as "this" <b><i>(\houtos\)</i></b> publican.<br>
 <B>{Rather than the other}</B> <b><i>(\par' ekeinon\)</i></b>. In comparison with<br>
 <b><i>(placed beside)</i></b> that one. A neat Greek idiom after the perfect<br>
 passive participle \dedikaiomenos\. <B>{For}</B> <b><i>(\hoti\)</i></b>. This moral<br>
 maxim Christ had already used in <!-#-->14:11. Plummer pertinently<br>
 asks: "Why is it assumed that Jesus did not repeat his sayings?"<br>
 <br>
 18:15 <B>{They brought}</B> <b><i>(\prosepheron\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, they were<br>
 bringing. So <!-#-->Mr 10:13. <B>{Their babes}</B> <b><i>(\ta breph&#275;\)</i></b>. Old word<br>
 for <B>{infants}</B>. Here <!-#-->Mr 10:13; Mt 19:13 have \paidia\ <b><i>(little<br>
 children)</i></b>. Note "also" <b><i>(\kai\)</i></b> in Luke, not in Mark and Matthew.<br>
 <B>{That he should touch them}</B> <b><i>(\hina aut&#333;n hapt&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 middle subjunctive <b><i>(linear action, repeatedly touch or one after<br>
 the other)</i></b>, where <!-#-->Mr 10:13 has aorist middle subjunctive<br>
 <b><i>(\haps&#275;tai\)</i></b>. <B>{Rebuked}</B> <b><i>(\epetim&#333;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect indicative<br>
 active. Either inchoative began to rebuke, or continued, kept on<br>
 rebuking. Matthew and Mark have the aorist \epetim&#275;san\.<br>
 <br>
 18:16 <B>{Called}</B> <b><i>(\prosekalesato\)</i></b>. Indirect middle aorist<br>
 indicative, called the children with their parents to himself and<br>
 then rebuked the disciples for their rebuke of the parents. The<br>
 language of Jesus is precisely that of <!-#-->Mr 10:14 which see, and<br>
 nearly that of <!-#-->Mt 19:14 which see also. The plea of Jesus that<br>
 children be allowed to come to him is one that many parents need<br>
 to heed. It is a tragedy to think of parents "forbidding" their<br>
 children or of preachers doing the same or of both being<br>
 stumbling-blocks to children.<br>
 <br>
 18:17 <B>{As a little child}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s paidion\)</i></b>. Jesus makes the child<br>
 the model for those who seek entrance into the kingdom of God,<br>
 not the adult the model for the child. He does not say that the<br>
 child is already in the kingdom without coming to him. Jesus has<br>
 made the child's world by understanding the child and opening the<br>
 door for him.<br>
 <br>
 18:18 <B>{Ruler}</B> <b><i>(\arch&#333;n\)</i></b>. Not in <!-#-->Mr 10:17; Mt 19:16. <B>{What<br>
 shall I do to inherit?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti poi&#275;sas kl&#275;ronom&#275;s&#333;;\)</i></b>. "By doing<br>
 what shall I inherit?" Aorist active participle and future active<br>
 indicative. Precisely the same question is asked by the lawyer in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 10:25. This young man probably thought that by some one act<br>
 he could obtain eternal life. He was ready to make a large<br>
 expenditure for it. <B>{Good}</B> <b><i>(\agathon\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mr 10:17; Mt<br>
 19:16 for discussion of this adjective for absolute goodness.<br>
 Plummer observes that no Jewish rabbi was called "good" in direct<br>
 address. The question of Jesus will show whether it was merely<br>
 fulsome flattery on the part of the young man or whether he<br>
 really put Jesus on a par with God. He must at any rate define<br>
 his attitude towards Christ.<br>
 <br>
 18:22 <B>{One thing thou lackest yet}</B> <b><i>(\eti hen soi leipei\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, one thing still fails thee or is wanting to thee. An<br>
 old verb with the dative of personal interest. <!-#-->Mr 10:21 has<br>
 here \husterei se\, which see. It was an amazing compliment for<br>
 one who was aiming at perfection <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 19:21)</i></b>. The youth<br>
 evidently had great charm and was sincere in his claims.<br>
 <B>{Distribute}</B> <b><i>(\diados\)</i></b>. Second aorist active imperative of<br>
 \diadid&#333;mi\ <b><i>(give to various ones, \dia-\)</i></b>. Here Mark and Matthew<br>
 simply have \dos\ <b><i>(give)</i></b>. The rest the same in all three Gospels.<br>
 <br>
 18:23 <B>{Became}</B> <b><i>(\egen&#275;th&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of<br>
 \ginomai\. Like his countenance fell <b><i>(\stugnasas\)</i></b>, in <!-#-->Mr<br>
 10:22. <B>{Exceedingly sorrowful}</B> <b><i>(\perilupos\)</i></b>. Old adjective<br>
 <b><i>(\peri, lup&#275;\)</i></b> with perfective use of \peri\. <B>{Very rich}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\plousios sphodra\)</i></b>. Rich exceedingly. Today, a<br>
 multimillionaire.<br>
 <br>
 18:24 <B>{Shall they enter}</B> <b><i>(\eisporeuontai\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 indicative, futuristic present.<br>
 <br>
 18:25 <B>{Through a needle's eye}</B> <b><i>(\dia tr&#275;matos belon&#275;s\)</i></b>. Both<br>
 words are old. \Tr&#275;ma\ means a perforation or hole or eye and in<br>
 the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mt 19:24. \Belon&#275;\ means originally the<br>
 point of a spear and then a surgeon's needle. Here only in the<br>
 N.T. <!-#-->Mr 10:25; Mt 19:24 have \rhaphidos\ for needle. This is<br>
 probably a current proverb for the impossible. The Talmud twice<br>
 speaks of an elephant passing through the eye of a needle as<br>
 being impossible.<br>
 <br>
 18:26 <B>{Then who}</B> <b><i>(\kai tis\)</i></b>. Literally, <B>{and who}</B>. The \kai\<br>
 calls attention to what has just been said. Wealth was assumed to<br>
 be mark of divine favour, not a hindrance to salvation.<br>
 <br>
 18:27 <B>{The impossible with men possible with God}</B> <b><i>(\ta adunata<br>
 para anthr&#333;pois dunata para t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>. Paradoxical, but true.<br>
 Take your stand "beside" <b><i>(\para\)</i></b> God and the impossible becomes<br>
 possible. Clearly then Jesus meant the humanly impossible by the<br>
 parabolic proverb about the camel going through the needle's eye.<br>
 God can break the grip of gold on a man's life, but even Jesus<br>
 failed with this young ruler.<br>
 <br>
 18:28 <B>{Our own}</B> <b><i>(\ta idia\)</i></b>. Our own things <b><i>(home, business,<br>
 etc.)</i></b>. Right here is where so many fail. Peter speaks here not in<br>
 a spirit of boastfulness, but rather with his reactions from<br>
 their consternation at what has happened and at the words of<br>
 Jesus <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:30 <B>{Shall not receive}</B> <b><i>(\ouchi m&#275; lab&#275;i\)</i></b>. Very strong double<br>
 negative with aorist active subjunctive of \lamban&#333;\. <B>{Manifold<br>
 more}</B> <b><i>(\pollaplasiona\)</i></b>. Late Greek word, here alone in the N.T.<br>
 save <!-#-->Mt 19:29 where Westcott and Hort have it though many MSS.<br>
 there read \hekatonplasiona\ <b><i>(a hundredfold)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Mr 10:30.<br>
 <br>
 18:31 <B>{Took unto him}</B> <b><i>(\paralab&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \paralamban&#333;\. Taking along with himself. So <!-#-->Mr<br>
 10:32. <!-#-->Mt 20:17 adds \kat' idian\ <b><i>(apart)</i></b>. Jesus is making a<br>
 special point of explaining his death to the Twelve. <B>{We go up}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anabainomen\)</i></b>. Present active indicative, we are going up.<br>
 <B>{Unto the Son of man}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i hui&#333;i tou anthr&#333;pou\)</i></b>. Dative case of<br>
 personal interest. The position is amphibolous and the<br>
 construction makes sense either with "shall be accomplished"<br>
 <b><i>(\telesth&#275;setai\)</i></b> or "that are written" <b><i>(\ta gegrammena\)</i></b>,<br>
 probably the former. Compare these minute details of the prophecy<br>
 here <b><i>(verses <!-#-->32f.)</i></b> with the words in <!-#-->Mr 10:33f.; Mt 20:18f.,<br>
 which see.<br>
 <br>
 18:33 <B>{The third day}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i h&#275;mer&#257;i t&#275;i trit&#275;i\)</i></b>. The day the<br>
 third. In <!-#-->Mt 20:19 it is "the third day" while in <!-#-->Mr 10:34<br>
 "after three days" occurs in the same sense, which see.<br>
 <br>
 18:34 <B>{And they perceived not}</B> <b><i>(\kai ouk egin&#333;skon\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active. They kept on not perceiving. Twice already Luke has said<br>
 this in the same sentence. <B>{They understood none of these things}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ouden tout&#333;n sun&#275;kan\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative, a<br>
 summary statement. <B>{This saying was hid from them}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n to rh&#275;ma<br>
 touto kekrummenon ap' aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Past perfect passive indicative<br>
 <b><i>(periphrastic)</i></b>, state of completion. It was a puzzling<br>
 experience. No wonder that Luke tries three times to explain the<br>
 continued failure of the apostles to understand Jesus. The words<br>
 of Christ about his death ran counter to all their hopes and<br>
 beliefs.<br>
 <br>
 18:35 <B>{Unto Jericho}</B> <b><i>(\eis Iereich&#333;\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 20:29; Mr<br>
 10:46, for discussion of the two Jerichos in Mark and Matt. <b><i>(the<br>
 old and the new as here)</i></b>. <B>{Begging}</B> <b><i>(\epait&#333;n\)</i></b>. Asking for<br>
 something. He probably was by the wayside between the old Jericho<br>
 and the new Roman Jericho. Mark gives his name Bartimaeus<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->10:46)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 20:30 mentions two.<br>
 <br>
 18:36 <B>{Inquired}</B> <b><i>(\epunthaneto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle. Repeatedly<br>
 inquired as he heard the tramp of the passing crowd going by<br>
 <b><i>(\diaporeuomenou\)</i></b>. <B>{What this meant}</B> <b><i>(\Ti ei&#275; touto\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, What it was. Without \an\ the optative is due to<br>
 indirect discourse, changed from \estin\. With \an\ <b><i>(margin of<br>
 Westcott and Hort)</i></b> the potential optative of the direct discourse<br>
 is simply retained.<br>
 <br>
 18:37 <B>{Passeth by}</B> <b><i>(\parerchetai\)</i></b>. Present middle indicative<br>
 retained in indirect discourse as \paragei\ is in <!-#-->Mt 20:30. No<br>
 reason for differences of English tenses in the two passages <b><i>(was<br>
 passing by, passeth by)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:38 <B>{He cried}</B> <b><i>(\ebo&#275;sen\)</i></b>. Old verb, \boa&#333;\, to shout, as in<br>
 <!-#-->9:38. <B>{Son of David}</B> <b><i>(\huie Daueid\)</i></b>. Shows that he recognizes<br>
 Jesus as the Messiah.<br>
 <br>
 18:39 <B>{That he should hold his peace}</B> <b><i>(\hina sig&#275;s&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Ingressive aorist subjunctive. That he should become silent; as<br>
 with \hina si&#333;p&#275;s&#275;i\ in <!-#-->Mr 10:48. <B>{The more a great deal}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\poll&#333;i m&#257;llon\)</i></b>. By much more as in <!-#-->Mr 10:48.<br>
 <br>
 18:40 <B>{Stood}</B> <b><i>(\statheis\)</i></b>. First aorist passive where <!-#-->Mr 10:49;<br>
 Mt 20:32 have \stas\ <b><i>(second aorist active)</i></b> translated "stood<br>
 still." One is as "still" as the other. The first is that Jesus "<br>
 stopped." <B>{Be brought}</B> <b><i>(\achth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist infinitive in<br>
 indirect command.<br>
 <br>
 18:41 <B>{What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti soi<br>
 theleis poi&#275;s&#333;;\)</i></b>. Same idiom in <!-#-->Mr 10:51; Mt 20:32 which see,<br>
 the use of \thel&#333;\ without \hina\ with aorist subjunctive <b><i>(or<br>
 future indicative)</i></b>. See same references also for \hina anableps&#333;\<br>
 "that I may see again" without verb before \hina\. Three uses of<br>
 \anablep&#333;\ here <b><i>(verses <!-#-->41,42,43)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:43 <B>{Followed}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kolouthei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active as in <!-#-->Mr<br>
 10:52. Either inchoative he began to follow, or descriptive, he<br>
 was following.<br>
