<p>4:1 <B>{The captain of the temple}</B> <b><i>(\ho strat&#275;gos tou hierou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Twenty-four bands of Levites guarded the temple, one guard at a<br>
 time. They watched the gates. The commander of each band was<br>
 called captain <b><i>(\strat&#275;gos\)</i></b>. Josephus names this captain of the<br>
 temple police next to the high priest <b><i>(_War_. VI. 5, 3)</i></b>. <B>{The<br>
 Sadducees}</B> <b><i>(\hoi Saddoukaioi\)</i></b>. Most of the priests were<br>
 Sadducees now and all the chief priests since John Hyrcanus I<br>
 deserted the Pharisees <b><i>(Josephus, _Ant_. XVII. 10, 6; XVIII. 1,<br>
 4; XX. 9, 1)</i></b>. The Sadducees were slow to line up with the<br>
 Pharisees against Jesus, but they now take the lead against Peter<br>
 and John. <B>{Came upon them}</B> <b><i>(\epest&#275;san autois\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active indicative <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b>. Burst upon them suddenly or<br>
 stood by them in a hostile attitude here <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 20:1; 24:4; Ac<br>
 6:12; 17:5; 22:20; 23:11)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:2 <B>{Being sore troubled}</B> <b><i>(\diaponoumenoi\)</i></b>. Present passive<br>
 participle of old verb \diapone&#333;\ <b><i>(perfective use of \dia\)</i></b> to be<br>
 worked up, indignant. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->16:8. <B>{Because}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dia to\)</i></b>. The articular infinitive with two accusatives, one<br>
 the object <b><i>(the people)</i></b>, the other <b><i>("they")</i></b> of general reference.<br>
 <B>{In Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\en I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. In the case of Jesus, an actual instance<br>
 of resurrection which the Sadducees denied <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 22:23)</i></b>. This<br>
 same use of \en\ appears in <!-#-->1Co 4:6 <b><i>(in us)</i></b>. The Sadducees were<br>
 also aristocrats and political ecclesiastics who disliked popular<br>
 disturbances. In particular, they resented the claim about Jesus<br>
 whom they had helped crucify.<br>
 <br>
 4:3 <B>{In ward}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;r&#275;sin\)</i></b>. Probably in one of the chambers of<br>
 the temple. In safe keeping <b><i>(from \t&#275;re&#333;\, to guard)</i></b>. Old word,<br>
 in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ac 5:18; 1Co 7:19. So in papyri. <B>{Now<br>
 eventide}</B> <b><i>(\hespera &#275;d&#275;\)</i></b>. Hence no trial could take place before<br>
 the next day, a regulation violated in the case of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 4:4 <B>{Men}</B> <b><i>(\andr&#333;n\)</i></b>. Strictly, men and not women, for<br>
 \anthr&#333;pos\ is the term for both men and women. But in <!-#-->Lu 11:31<br>
 \andres\ seems to include both men and women and that is possible<br>
 here, though by no means certain, for see <!-#-->Mt 14:21 where the<br>
 women and children are expressly excepted.<br>
 <br>
 4:5 <B>{Rulers and elders and scribes}</B> <b><i>(\tous archontas kai tous<br>
 presbuterous kai tous grammateis\)</i></b>. The three classes composing<br>
 the Sanhedrin <b><i>(rulers=chief priests who were Sadducees, the<br>
 scribes usually Pharisees, the elders not in either class: 24<br>
 priests, 24 elders, 22 scribes)</i></b>. <B>{Were gathered together}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sunachth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist passive infinitive of \sunag&#333;\<br>
 with accusative of general reference and the subject of<br>
 \egeneto\.<br>
 <br>
 4:6 <B>{Annas}</B> <b><i>(\Hannas\)</i></b>. One of the rulers or chief priests,<br>
 ex-high priest <b><i>(A.D. 7-14)</i></b> and father-in-law of <B>{Caiaphas}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Kaiaphas\)</i></b> who was actual high priest at that time, though the<br>
 title clung to Annas as here <b><i>(both so called in <!-#-->Lu 3:2)</i></b>,<br>
 Caiaphas so by Roman law, Annas so in the opinion of the Jews.<br>
 They with John and Alexander are the leaders among the Sadducees<br>
 in pressing the case against Peter and John.<br>
 <br>
 4:7 <B>{In the midst}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i mes&#333;i\)</i></b>. The Sanhedrin sat in a<br>
 semicircle. <B>{They inquired}</B> <b><i>(\epunthanonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle,<br>
 began to inquire. <B>{Or in what name}</B> <b><i>(\&#275; en poi&#333;i onomati\)</i></b>. As if<br>
 by some magical formula such as exorcists practised <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 19:13)</i></b><br>
 as if to catch them by <b><i>(<!-#-->De 13:1)</i></b>. <B>{Have ye done this}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epoi&#275;sate touto humeis\)</i></b>. Note emphatic use of \humeis\ <b><i>(ye)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:8 <B>{Filled with the Holy Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;stheis pneumatos hagiou\)</i></b>.<br>
 For this occasion and so above all fear as in verse <!-#-->31 and as<br>
 in <!-#-->2:4.<br>
 <br>
 4:9 <B>{Concerning a good deed done to an impotent man}</B> <b><i>(\epi<br>
 euergesi&#257;i anthr&#333;pou asthenous\)</i></b>. Objective genitive. Note<br>
 \euergesia\ <b><i>(old word, in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->1Ti 6:2)</i></b>, as a<br>
 benefactor, not a malefactor. Skilful turn made by Peter. <B>{Is<br>
 made whole}</B> <b><i>(\ses&#333;stai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative of \s&#333;z&#333;\,<br>
 stands whole.<br>
 <br>
 4:10 <B>{Be it known}</B> <b><i>(\gn&#333;ston est&#333;\)</i></b>. Imperative present active<br>
 third singular of \eimi\, to be, and the verbal adjective<br>
 \gn&#333;ston\. <B>{Whom ye crucified}</B> <b><i>(\hon humeis estaur&#333;sate\)</i></b>. Too<br>
 good a chance to miss, and so Peter boldly charges the Sanhedrin<br>
 with responsibility for the death of Jesus. Note \humeis\ <b><i>(ye)</i></b><br>
 again. <B>{Whom God raised from the dead}</B> <b><i>(\hon ho theos &#275;geiren ek<br>
 nekr&#333;n\)</i></b>. Note repetition of \hon\ <b><i>(whom)</i></b>. This is God's answer<br>
 to their act of crucifixion. <B>{In him doth this man stand}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 tout&#333;i houtos parest&#275;ken\)</i></b>. Rather <b><i>(note play on \houtos\)</i></b>, "In<br>
 this one <b><i>(\hon, hon\)</i></b> this one stands <b><i>(present perfect active<br>
 indicative, intransitive)</i></b>." In Jesus this man stands before you<br>
 whole <b><i>(\hugi&#275;s\)</i></b>. It was a centre shot.<br>
 <br>
 4:11 <B>{Of you the builders}</B> <b><i>(\huph' hum&#333;n t&#333;n oikodom&#333;n\)</i></b>. The<br>
 experts, the architects, had rejected Jesus for their building<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps 118:22)</i></b> as Jesus himself had pointed out <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 21:42; Lu<br>
 21:17)</i></b>. This very Rejected Stone God had made the head of the<br>
 corner <b><i>(either the highest corner stone right under the roof or<br>
 the corner stone under the building, <!-#-->Isa 28:16)</i></b> as Jesus<br>
 showed, as Peter here declares and repeats later <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 2:6f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:12 <B>{Salvation}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; s&#333;t&#275;ria\)</i></b>. The Messianic salvation as in<br>
 <!-#-->5:31; 17:11 and as Jesus meant in <!-#-->Joh 4:22. It is amazing to<br>
 see Peter speaking thus to the Sanhedrin and proclaiming the<br>
 necessity of salvation <b><i>(\dei s&#333;th&#275;nai\)</i></b> in the name of Jesus<br>
 Christ and in no other. If this was true then, it is true today.<br>
 There is no second <b><i>(\heteron\)</i></b> name to go beside that of Jesus in<br>
 India, China, Japan, or America.<br>
 <br>
 4:13 <B>{The boldness}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n parr&#275;sian\)</i></b>. Telling it all <b><i>(\pan,<br>
 r&#275;sia\)</i></b>. See also verses <!-#-->29,31. Actually Peter had turned the<br>
 table on the Sanhedrin and had arraigned them before the bar of<br>
 God. <B>{Had perceived}</B> <b><i>(\katalabomenoi\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle<br>
 participle of \katalamban&#333;\, common verb to grasp strongly<br>
 <b><i>(\kata\)</i></b>, literally or with the mind <b><i>(especially middle voice)</i></b>,<br>
 to comprehend. The rulers recalled Peter and John from having<br>
 seen them often with Jesus, probably during the temple teaching,<br>
 etc. <B>{They were unlearned}</B> <b><i>(\agrammatoi eisin\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 indicative retained in indirect discourse. Unlettered men without<br>
 technical training in the professional rabbinical schools of<br>
 Hillel or Shammai. Jesus himself was so regarded <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 7:15,<br>
 "not having learned letters")</i></b>. <B>{And ignorant}</B> <b><i>(\kai idi&#333;tai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Old word, only here in the N.T. and <!-#-->1Co 14:24; 2Co 11:6. It<br>
 does not mean "ignorant," but a layman, a man not in office <b><i>(a<br>
 private person)</i></b>, a common soldier and not an officer, a man not<br>
 skilled in the schools, very much like \agrammatos\. It is from<br>
 \idios\ <b><i>(one's own)</i></b> and our "idiosyncracy" is one with an excess<br>
 of such a trait, while "idiot" <b><i>(this very word)</i></b> is one who has<br>
 nothing but his idiosyncracy. Peter and John were men of ability<br>
 and of courage, but they did not belong to the set of the rabbis.<br>
 <B>{They marvelled}</B> <b><i>(\ethaumazon\)</i></b>. Imperfect <b><i>(inchoative)</i></b> active,<br>
 began to wonder and kept it up. <B>{Took knowledge of them}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epegin&#333;skon autous\)</i></b>. Imperfect <b><i>(inchoative)</i></b> active again, they<br>
 began to recognize them as men that they had seen with Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 4:14 <B>{They could say nothing against it}</B> <b><i>(\ouden eichon<br>
 anteipein\)</i></b>. Imperfect again, they kept on having nothing to say<br>
 against it. The lame man was standing there before their eyes in<br>
 proof of what Peter had said.<br>
 <br>
 4:15 <B>{They conferred among themselves}</B> <b><i>(\suneballon pros<br>
 all&#275;lous\)</i></b>. Imperfect active again. With Peter and John and the<br>
 lame man outside, they began to compare <b><i>(\sun, ball&#333;\)</i></b> notes and<br>
 take stock of their predicament.<br>
 <br>
 4:16 <B>{What shall we do?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti poi&#275;s&#333;men\)</i></b>. Deliberative aorist<br>
 active subjunctive <b><i>(ingressive and urgent aorist)</i></b>. <B>{Notable<br>
 miracle}</B> <b><i>(\gn&#333;ston s&#275;meion\)</i></b>. Or sign. It was useless to deny it<br>
 with the man there. <B>{We cannot deny it}</B> <b><i>(\ou dunametha<br>
 arneisthai\)</i></b>. That is, it will do no good.<br>
 <br>
 4:17 <B>{That it spread no further}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275; epi pleion<br>
 dianem&#275;th&#275;i\)</i></b>. First aorist passive subjunctive of \dianem&#333;\, to<br>
 distribute with \hina m&#275;\, negative purpose. <B>{Let us threaten<br>
 them}</B> <b><i>(\apeil&#275;s&#333;metha autois\)</i></b>. Hortatory aorist middle<br>
 subjunctive of \apeile&#333;\, old verb <b><i>(note middle voice)</i></b>. In the<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->1Pe 2:23. <B>{That they speak henceforth to no<br>
 man in this name}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;keti lalein epi t&#333;i onomati tout&#333;i m&#275;deni<br>
 anthr&#333;p&#333;n\)</i></b>. Indirect command with the infinitive and double<br>
 negative <b><i>(\m&#275;keti, m&#275;deni\)</i></b>. They will not say "Jesus," but make<br>
 a slur at "this name," contemptuous use of \houtos\, though they<br>
 apparently do mention the name "Jesus" in verse <!-#-->18.<br>
 <br>
 4:18 <B>{Not to speak at all}</B> <b><i>(\katholou m&#275; phtheggesthai\)</i></b>. Same<br>
 construction as above, infinitive in indirect command with<br>
 negative \m&#275;\ <b><i>(and \m&#275;de\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:20 <B>{For we cannot but speak}</B> <b><i>(\ou dunametha gar h&#275;meis--m&#275;<br>
 lalein\)</i></b>. Both negatives hold here, "For we <b><i>(note emphatic<br>
 \h&#275;meis\)</i></b> are not able not to speak" <b><i>(what we saw and heard)</i></b>.<br>
 This is defiance of the civil and ecclesiastical authorities that<br>
 was justified, for the temple authorities stepped in between the<br>
 conscience and God. Peter and John were willing to pay the price<br>
 of this defiance with their lives. This is the courage of martyrs<br>
 through all the ages.<br>
 <br>
 4:21 <B>{When they had further threatened them}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\prosapeil&#275;samenoi\)</i></b>. The "further" is in "pros" <b><i>(in addition)</i></b>,<br>
 <B>{Finding nothing how they might punish them}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;den heuriskontes<br>
 to p&#333;s kolas&#333;ntai autous\)</i></b>. Note the article "to" before \p&#333;s\<br>
 <b><i>(how)</i></b>, "the how." Aorist middle deliberative subjunctive<br>
 \kolas&#333;ntai\ in indirect question after \p&#333;s\ from \kolaz&#333;\, to<br>
 lop <b><i>(\kolos\, lopped)</i></b>, to curb, to prune, to correct, to punish.<br>
 Old verb, in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->2Pe 2:9. <B>{Glorified God}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\edoxazon ton theon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, kept on glorifying God<br>
 while the Sanhedrin were threatening Peter and John. It was to<br>
 laugh at the helplessness of the Sanhedrin.<br>
 <br>
 4:22 <B>{Was wrought}</B> <b><i>(\gegonei\)</i></b>. Second past perfect active<br>
 without augment from \ginomai\.<br>
 <br>
 4:23 <B>{To their own company}</B> <b><i>(\pros tous idious\)</i></b>. Their own<br>
 people as in <!-#-->Joh 1:11; 13:1; Ac 24:23; 1Ti 5:8; Tit 3:14, not<br>
 merely the apostles <b><i>(all the disciples)</i></b>. In spite of Peter's<br>
 courageous defiance he and John told the brotherhood all that had<br>
 been said by the Sanhedrin. They had real apprehension of the<br>
 outcome.<br>
 <br>
 4:24 <B>{With one accord}</B> <b><i>(\homothumadon\)</i></b>. A concert of voices as<br>
 already seen by the word in <!-#-->1:14; 2:46 and later in <!-#-->5:12;<br>
 7:57; 15:25. <B>{O Lord}</B> <b><i>(\Despota\)</i></b>. Our word despot. Old word for<br>
 relation of master to slaves or household servants <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 6:1; 2Ti<br>
 2:21; Tit 2:9; 1Pe 2:18)</i></b>. Simeon thus addressed God <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:29)</i></b>.<br>
 So in <!-#-->2Pe 2:1; Jude 1:4; Re 6:10. See "slaves" in verse <!-#-->29.<br>
 <br>
 4:25 <B>{By the mouth of our father David}</B> <b><i>(\tou patros h&#275;m&#333;n dia<br>
 pneumatos hagiou stomatos Daueid\)</i></b>. From <!-#-->Ps 2:1f. here ascribed<br>
 to David. Baumgarten suggests that the whole company sang the<br>
 second Psalm and then Peter applied it to this emergency. The<br>
 Greek MSS. do not have \dia\ <b><i>(by)</i></b> here before \stomatos\, but<br>
 only \dia\ before \pneumatos hagiou\ <b><i>(the Holy Spirit)</i></b>. Hort<br>
 calls this a "primitive error" perhaps due to an early scribe who<br>
 omitted this second \dia\ so close to the first \dia\ <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Introduction to the Textual Criticism of the N.T._, p. 238)</i></b>. A<br>
 small list of such primitive errors is there given as suggested<br>
 by Dr. Hort. <B>{Why}</B> <b><i>(\hina ti\)</i></b>. This Greek idiom calls for<br>
 \gen&#275;tai\ <b><i>(second aorist middle subjunctive)</i></b>, <B>{That what may<br>
 happen}</B>. <B>{The Gentiles}</B> <b><i>(\ethn&#275;\)</i></b>. So always in LXX, while \laoi\<br>
 <b><i>(peoples)</i></b> can include Jews. <B>{Did rage}</B> <b><i>(\ephruaxan\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active indicative of \phruass&#333;\, late word, to neigh like<br>
 a horse, to prance or stamp the ground, to put on lofty airs.<br>
 Only here in the N.T. in this quotation from <!-#-->Ps 2:1. <B>{Imagine}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\emelet&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of \meleta&#333;\. Old<br>
 verb from \melet&#275;\ <b><i>(care)</i></b>, to practise, to caution, as orators<br>
 and rhetoricians. Only here in the N.T. in this quotation.<br>
 <br>
 4:26 <B>{Set themselves in array}</B> <b><i>(\parest&#275;san\)</i></b>. Literally, stood<br>
 by. <B>{Against his Anointed}</B> <b><i>(\kata tou Christou autou\)</i></b>. Against<br>
 his Messiah, his Christ.<br>
 <br>
 4:27 <B>{Both Herod and Pontios Pilate}</B> <b><i>(\H&#275;r&#333;id&#275;s te kai Pontius<br>
 Peilatos\)</i></b>. Luke alone <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:12)</i></b> tells of the reconciliation<br>
 between Herod and Pilate at the trial of Jesus. So Peter and the<br>
 rest interpret this prophecy as directly fulfilled in their<br>
 conduct towards Jesus Christ. <B>{Whom thou didst anoint}</B> <b><i>(\hon<br>
 echrisas\)</i></b>. As in verse <!-#-->26 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Lu 4:18; Isa 61:1)</i></b>.<br>
 Inaugurated as King Messiah.<br>
 <br>
 4:28 <B>{Foreordained}</B> <b><i>(\pro&#333;risen\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative<br>
 of \prooriz&#333;\, "They rise above sight and seem to see the Hand<br>
 which 'shapes men's ends, rough hew them how they will'"<br>
 <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:29 <B>{And now}</B> <b><i>(\kai ta nun\)</i></b>. "And as to <b><i>(accusative of general<br>
 reference)</i></b> the now things <b><i>(the present situation)</i></b>." Only in the<br>
 Acts in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->5:38; 17:30; 20:32; 27:22)</i></b>. <B>{Grant}</B> <b><i>(\dos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist active imperative of \did&#333;mi\, urgency of the<br>
 aorist, Do it now. <B>{To speak thy word with all boldness}</B> <b><i>(\meta<br>
 parr&#275;sias pas&#275;s lalein ton logon sou\)</i></b>. Literally, "with all<br>
 boldness to go on speaking <b><i>(present active infinitive)</i></b> thy word."<br>
 Peter and John had defied the Sanhedrin in verse <!-#-->20, but all<br>
 the same and all the more they pray for courage in deed to live<br>
 up to their brave words. A wholesome lesson.<br>
 <br>
 4:30 <B>{While thou stretchest forth thy hand}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i t&#275;n cheira<br>
 ekteinein se\)</i></b>. Luke's favourite idiom, "In the stretching out<br>
 <b><i>(articular present active infinitive)</i></b> the hand as to thee"<br>
 <b><i>(accusative of general reference)</i></b>, the second allusion to God's<br>
 "hand" in this prayer <b><i>(verse <!-#-->28)</i></b>. <B>{To heal}</B> <b><i>(\eis iasin\)</i></b>. For<br>
 healing. See verse <!-#-->22. <B>{And that signs and wonders may be done}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai s&#275;meia kai terata ginesthai\)</i></b>. Either to be taken as in the<br>
 same construction as \ekteinein\ with \en t&#333;i\ as Revised Version<br>
 has it here or to be treated as subordinate purpose to \en t&#333;i<br>
 ekteinein\ <b><i>(as Knowling, Page, Wendt, Hackett)</i></b>. The latter most<br>
 likely true. They ask for a visible sign or proof that God has<br>
 heard this prayer for courage to be faithful even unto death.<br>
 <br>
 4:31 <B>{The place was shaken}</B> <b><i>(\esaleuth&#275; ho topos\)</i></b>. By an<br>
 earthquake most likely as in <!-#-->16:26, but none the less a token<br>
 of God's presence and power <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps 114:7; Isa 2:19,21; Heb<br>
 12:26f.)</i></b>. <B>{Were gathered together}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san sun&#275;gmenoi\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic past perfect passive of \sunag&#333;\. <B>{They spake}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\elaloun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active indicative, began to speak, after<br>
 being filled <b><i>(\epl&#275;sth&#275;san\, aorist passive indicative)</i></b> with the<br>
 Holy Spirit. Luke uses the very words of the prayer in verse <!-#-->29<br>
 to describe their conduct.<br>
 <br>
 4:32 <B>{Of one heart and soul}</B> <b><i>(\kardia kai psuch&#275; mia\)</i></b>. It is not<br>
 possible to make sharp distinction between heart and soul here<br>
 <b><i>(see <!-#-->Mr 12:30)</i></b>, only that there was harmony in thought and<br>
 affection. But the English translation is curiously unlike the<br>
 Greek original. "There was one heart and soul <b><i>(nominative case,<br>
 not genitive as the English has it)</i></b> in the multitude <b><i>(\tou<br>
 pl&#275;thous\, subjective genitive)</i></b> of those who believed." <B>{Not one<br>
 of them}</B> <b><i>(\oude heis\)</i></b>. More emphatic than \oudeis\, "not even<br>
 one." <B>{Common}</B> <b><i>(\koina\)</i></b>. In the use of their property, not in<br>
 the possession as Luke proceeds to explain. The word \koinos\ is<br>
 kin to \sun\ <b><i>(together with)</i></b>=\xun\ <b><i>(Epic)</i></b> and so \xunos=koinos\.<br>
 See this word already in <!-#-->2:44. The idea of unclean <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10:15)</i></b><br>
 is a later development from the original notion of common to all.<br>
 <br>
 4:33 <B>{Gave their witness}</B> <b><i>(\apedidoun to marturion\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active of \apodid&#333;mi\, old verb to give back, to pay back a debt<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 7:42)</i></b>, but a late omega form instead of the usual<br>
 \apedidosan\. They kept on giving their witness with power after<br>
 the answer to their prayer <b><i>(verse <!-#-->31)</i></b>. <B>{Of the resurrection}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\t&#275;s anastase&#333;s\)</i></b>. It was on this issue that the Sadducees had<br>
 arrested them <b><i>(<!-#-->4:1-3)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:34 <B>{That lacked}</B> <b><i>(\ende&#275;s\)</i></b>. Literally, in need, old adjective,<br>
 here only in the N.T. <B>{Were}</B> <b><i>(\hup&#275;rchon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of<br>
 \huparch&#333;\, to exist. <B>{Sold them and brought}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;lountes<br>
 epheron\)</i></b>. Present active participle and imperfect active<br>
 indicative. Selling they brought from time to time, as there was<br>
 occasion by reason of need. Hence the wants were kept supplied.<br>
 <B>{Laid them}</B> <b><i>(\etithoun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active again, _repetition_,<br>
 of \tith&#275;mi\, late omega form for the usual \etithesan\.<br>

 4:35 <B>{Distribution was made}</B> <b><i>(\diedideto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive of<br>
 \diadid&#333;mi\, late omega form for \diedidoto\ <b><i>(the stem vowel \o\<br>
 displaced by \e\)</i></b>. Impersonal use of the verb here. <B>{According as<br>
 any one had need}</B> <b><i>(\kathoti an tis chreian eichen\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active of \ech&#333;\ with \kathoti\ and \an\ with the notion of<br>
 customary repetition in a comparative clause <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 967)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:36 <B>{Barnabas}</B> <b><i>(\Barnabas\)</i></b>. His name was Joseph <b><i>(correct text,<br>
 and not Jesus)</i></b> and he is mentioned as one illustration of those<br>
 in verse <!-#-->34 who selling brought the money. The apostles gave<br>
 him the nickname Barnabas by which later he was known because of<br>
 this noble deed. This fact argues that all did not actually sell,<br>
 but were ready to do so if needed. Possibly Joseph had a larger<br>
 estate than some others also. The meaning of the nickname is<br>
 given by Luke as "son of consolation or exhortation" <b><i>(\huios<br>
 parakl&#275;se&#333;s\)</i></b>. Doubtless his gifts as a preacher lay along this<br>
 same line. Rackham thinks that the apostles gave him this name<br>
 when he was recognized as a prophet. In <!-#-->Ac 11:23 the very word<br>
 \parekalei\ <b><i>(exhorted)</i></b> is used of Barnabas up at Antioch. He is<br>
 the type of preacher described by Paul in <!-#-->1Co 14:3.<br>
 Encouragement is the chief idea in \parakl&#275;sis\ though<br>
 exhortation, comfort, consolation are used to render it <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 9:31; 13:15; 15:31)</i></b>. See also <!-#-->16:9; 20:12. It is not necessary<br>
 to think that the apostles coined the name Barnabas for Joseph<br>
 which originally may have come from \Barnebous\ <b><i>(Deissmann,<br>
 _Bible Studies_, pp. 308-10)</i></b>, son of Nebo, or even the Hebrew<br>
 _Bar Nebi_ <b><i>(son of a prophet)</i></b>. But, whatever the origin, the<br>
 popular use is given by Luke. He was even called apostle along<br>
 with Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 14:14)</i></b> in the broad sense of that word.<br>
 <br>
 4:37 <B>{Having a held}</B> <b><i>(\huparchontos aut&#333;i agrou\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute with present active participle of \huparch&#333;\ and dative<br>
 of possession. <B>{Sold it and brought}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;l&#275;sas &#275;negken\)</i></b>. Aorist<br>
 active participle of \p&#333;le&#333;\ and second aorist active indicative<br>
 of \pher&#333;\ because a single definite instance. So also with<br>
 \eth&#275;ken\ <b><i>(laid)</i></b>, first aorist active.<br>
