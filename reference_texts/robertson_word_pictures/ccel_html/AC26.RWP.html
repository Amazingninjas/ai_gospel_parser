 <HR>
<p>26:1 <B>{Thou art permitted}</B> <b><i>(\epitrepetai soi\)</i></b>. Literally, It is<br>
 permitted thee. As if Agrippa were master of ceremonies instead<br>
 of Festus. Agrippa as a king and guest presides at the grand<br>
 display while Festus has simply introduced Paul. <B>{For thyself}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\huper seautou\)</i></b>. Some MSS. have \peri\ <b><i>(concerning)</i></b>. Paul is<br>
 allowed to speak in his own behalf. No charges are made against<br>
 him. In fact, Festus has admitted that he has no real proof of<br>
 any charges. <B>{Stretched forth his hand}</B> <b><i>(\ekteinas t&#275;n cheira\)</i></b>.<br>
 Dramatic oratorical gesture <b><i>(not for silence as in <!-#-->12:17;<br>
 13:16)</i></b> with the chain still upon it <b><i>(verse <!-#-->29)</i></b> linking him to<br>
 the guard. First aorist active participle of \ektein&#333;\, to<br>
 stretch out. <B>{Made his defence}</B> <b><i>(\apelogeito\)</i></b>. Inchoative<br>
 imperfect of \apologeomai\ <b><i>(middle)</i></b>, "began to make his defence."<br>
 This is the fullest of all Paul's defences. He has no word of<br>
 censure of his enemies or of resentment, but seizes the<br>
 opportunity to preach Christ to such a distinguished company<br>
 which he does with "singular dignity" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. He is now<br>
 bearing the name of Christ "before kings" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 9:15)</i></b>. In general<br>
 Paul follows the line of argument of the speech on the stairs<br>
 <b><i>(chapter <!-#-->Ac 22)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 26:2 <B>{I think myself happy}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;g&#275;mai emauton makarion\)</i></b>. See on<br>
 &#175;Mt 5:3 for \makarios\. Blass notes that Paul, like Tertullus,<br>
 begins with _captatio benevolentiae_, but _absque adulatione_. He<br>
 says only what he can truthfully speak. For \h&#275;g&#275;mai\ see <!-#-->Php<br>
 3:7; 1Ti 6:1 <b><i>(perfect middle indicative of \h&#275;geomai\)</i></b>, I have<br>
 considered. <B>{That I am to make my defence}</B> <b><i>(\mell&#333;n<br>
 apologeisthai\)</i></b>. Literally, "being about to make my defence."<br>
 <B>{Whereof I am accused}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;n egkaloumai\)</i></b>. Genitive with<br>
 \egkaloumai\ as in <!-#-->19:40 or by attraction from accusative of<br>
 relative <b><i>(\ha\)</i></b> to case of antecedent <b><i>(\pant&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 26:3 <B>{Especially because thou art expert}</B> <b><i>(\malista gn&#333;st&#275;n onta<br>
 se\)</i></b>. Or like the margin, "because thou art especially expert,"<br>
 according as \malista\ is construed. \Gn&#333;st&#275;n\ is from \gin&#333;sk&#333;\<br>
 and means a knower, expert, connoisseur. Plutarch uses it and<br>
 Deissmann <b><i>(_Light_, etc., p. 367)</i></b> restores it in a papyrus.<br>
 Agrippa had the care of the temple, the appointment of the high<br>
 priest, and the care of the sacred vestments. But the accusative<br>
 \onta se\ gives trouble here coming so soon after \sou\ <b><i>(genitive<br>
 with \epi\)</i></b>. Some MSS. insert \epistamenos\ or \eid&#333;s\ <b><i>(knowing)</i></b><br>
 but neither is genuine. Page takes it as "governed by the sense<br>
 of thinking or considering." Knowling considers it an<br>
 anacoluthon. Buttmann held it to be an accusative absolute after<br>
 the old Greek idiom. \Tuchon\ is such an instance though used as<br>
 an adverb <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 16:6)</i></b>. It is possible that one exists in <!-#-->Eph<br>
 1:18. See other examples discussed in Robertson's _Grammar_, pp.<br>
 490f. <B>{Customs and questions}</B> <b><i>(\eth&#333;n te kai z&#275;t&#275;mat&#333;n\)</i></b>. Both<br>
 _consuetudinum in practicis_ and _quaestionum in theoreticis_<br>
 <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>. Agrippa was qualified to give Paul an understanding and<br>
 a sympathetic hearing. Paul understands perfectly the grand-stand<br>
 play of the whole performance, but he refused to be silent and<br>
 chose to use this opportunity, slim as it seemed, to get a fresh<br>
 hearing for his own case and to present the claims of Christ to<br>
 this influential man. His address is a masterpiece of noble<br>
 apologetic. <B>{Patiently}</B> <b><i>(\makrothum&#333;s\)</i></b>. Adverb from<br>
 \makrothumos\. Only here in the N.T., though \makrothumia\ occurs<br>
 several times. Vulgate has _longanimiter_. Long spirit,<br>
 endurance, opposite of impatience. So Paul takes his time.<br>
 <br>
 26:4 <B>{My manner of life}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n men oun bi&#333;sin mou\)</i></b>. With \men<br>
 oun\ Paul passes from the _captatio benevolentiae_ <b><i>(verses <!-#-->1,2)</i></b><br>
 "to the _narratio_ or statement of his case" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. \Bi&#333;sis\ is<br>
 from \bio&#333;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 4:2)</i></b> and that from \bios\ <b><i>(course of life)</i></b>.<br>
 This is the only instance of \bi&#333;sis\ yet found except the<br>
 Prologue <b><i>(10)</i></b> of Ecclesiasticus and an inscription given in<br>
 Ramsay's _Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia_, Vol II, p. 650.<br>
 <B>{Know}</B> <b><i>(\is&#257;si\)</i></b>. Literary form instead of the vernacular _Koin&#275;_<br>
 \oidasin\. Paul's early life in Tarsus and Jerusalem was an open<br>
 book to all Jews.<br>
 <br>
 26:5 <B>{Having knowledge of me from the first}</B> <b><i>(\progin&#333;skontes me<br>
 an&#333;then\)</i></b>. Literally, "knowing me beforehand" <b><i>(both \pro\ and<br>
 \an&#333;then\)</i></b>, from the beginning of Paul's public education in<br>
 Jerusalem <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->2Pe 3:17. <B>{If they be willing to<br>
 testify}</B> <b><i>(\ean thel&#333;sin marturein\)</i></b>. Condition of third class<br>
 <b><i>(\ean\ and subjunctive)</i></b>. A neat turning of the tables on the<br>
 distinguished audience about Paul's Jerusalem reputation before<br>
 his conversion. <B>{After the straitest sect}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n akribestat&#275;n<br>
 hairesin\)</i></b>. This is a true superlative <b><i>(not elative)</i></b> and one of<br>
 the three <b><i>(also \hagi&#333;tatos\, <!-#-->Jude 1:20, \timi&#333;tatos\ <!-#-->Re<br>
 18:12; 21:11)</i></b> superlatives in \-tatos\ in the N.T. <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, pp. 279f., 670)</i></b>, though common enough in the LXX and<br>
 the papyri. \Hairesin\ <b><i>(choosing)</i></b> is properly used here with<br>
 Pharisees <b><i>(Josephus, _Life_, 38)</i></b>. <B>{Religion}</B> <b><i>(\thr&#275;skeias\)</i></b>. From<br>
 \thr&#275;skeu&#333;\ and this from \thr&#275;skos\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Jas 1:26)</i></b>, old word for<br>
 religious worship or discipline, common in the papyri and<br>
 inscriptions <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan's _Vocabulary_)</i></b> for reverent<br>
 worship, not mere external ritual. In N.T. only here, <!-#-->Jas<br>
 1:26f.; Col 2:18. <B>{I lived a Pharisee}</B> <b><i>(\ez&#275;sa Pharisaios\)</i></b>.<br>
 Emphatic position. Paul knew the rules of the Pharisees and<br>
 played the game to the full <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 1:14; Php 3:5f.)</i></b>. The Talmud<br>
 makes it plain what the life of a Pharisee was. Paul had become<br>
 one of the leaders and stars of hope for his sect.<br>
 <br>
 26:6 <B>{And now}</B> <b><i>(\kai nun\)</i></b>. Sharp comparison between his youth<br>
 and the present. <B>{To be judged for the hope}</B> <b><i>(\ep'<br>
 elpidi--krinomenos\)</i></b>. The hope of the resurrection and of the<br>
 promised Messiah <b><i>(<!-#-->13:32)</i></b>. Page calls verses <!-#-->6-8 a parenthesis<br>
 in the course of Paul's argument by which he shows that his life<br>
 in Christ is a real development of the best in Pharisaism. He<br>
 does resume his narrative in verse <!-#-->9, but verses <!-#-->6-8 are the<br>
 core of his defence already presented in <!-#-->Ga 3; Ro 9-11 where he<br>
 proves that the children of faith are the real seed of Abraham.<br>
 <br>
 26:7 <B>{Our twelve tribes}</B> <b><i>(\to d&#333;dekaphulon h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. A word found<br>
 only here in N.T. and in Christian and Jewish writings, though<br>
 \d&#333;dekam&#275;non\ <b><i>(twelve month)</i></b> is common in the papyri and<br>
 \dekaphulos\ <b><i>(ten tribes)</i></b> in Herodotus. Paul's use of this word<br>
 for the Jewish people, like <!-#-->Jas 1:1 <b><i>(\tais d&#333;deka phulais\, the<br>
 twelve tribes)</i></b>, shows that Paul had no knowledge of any "lost ten<br>
 tribes." There is a certain national pride and sense of unity in<br>
 spite of the dispersion <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. <B>{Earnestly}</B> <b><i>(\en ektenei&#257;i\)</i></b>. A<br>
 late word from \ektein&#333;\, to stretch out, only here in N.T., but<br>
 in papyri and inscriptions. Page refers to Simeon and Anna <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 2:25-28)</i></b> as instances of Jews looking for the coming of the<br>
 Messiah. Note the accusative of \nukta kai h&#275;meran\ as in<br>
 <!-#-->20:31. <B>{Hope to attain}</B> <b><i>(\elpizei katant&#275;sai\)</i></b>. This Messianic<br>
 hope had been the red thread running through Jewish history.<br>
 Today, alas, it is a sadly worn thread for Jews who refuse to see<br>
 the Messiah in Jesus. <B>{I am accused by Jews}</B> <b><i>(\egkaloumai hupo<br>
 Ioudai&#333;n\)</i></b>. The very word used in <!-#-->23:28 <b><i>(\enekaloun\)</i></b> which<br>
 see, and by Jews of all people in the world whose mainspring was<br>
 this very "hope." It is a tremendously effective turn.<br>
 <br>
 26:8 <B>{Incredible with you}</B> <b><i>(\apiston par' humin\)</i></b>. This old word<br>
 \apiston\ <b><i>(\a\ privative and \pistos\)</i></b> means either unfaithful<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 12:46)</i></b>, unbelieving <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 20:27)</i></b>, or unbelievable as<br>
 here). Paul turns suddenly from Agrippa to the audience <b><i>(\par'<br>
 humin\, plural)</i></b>, most of whom were probably Gentiles and scouted<br>
 the doctrine of the resurrection as at Athens <b><i>(<!-#-->17:32)</i></b>. <B>{If God<br>
 doth raise the dead}</B> <b><i>(\ei ho theos nekrous egeirei\)</i></b>. Condition<br>
 of the first class assuming that God does raise dead people. Only<br>
 God can do it. This rhetorical question needs no answer, though<br>
 the narrative resumed in verse <!-#-->9 does it in a way.<br>
 <br>
 26:9 <B>{I verily thought with myself}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; men oun edoxa<br>
 emaut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Personal construction instead of the impersonal, a<br>
 touch of the literary style. Paul's "egoism" is deceived as so<br>
 often happens. <B>{I ought}</B> <b><i>(\dein\)</i></b>. Infinitive the usual<br>
 construction with \doke&#333;\. Necessity and a sense of duty drove<br>
 Paul on even in this great sin <b><i>(see on &#175;23:1)</i></b>, a common failing<br>
 with persecutors. <B>{Contrary}</B> <b><i>(\enantia\)</i></b>. Old word <b><i>(adjective)</i></b>,<br>
 over against, opposite <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 27:4)</i></b>, then hostile to as here.<br>
 <br>
 26:10 <B>{I both shut up many}</B> <b><i>(\pollous te katekleisa\)</i></b>. Effective<br>
 aorist active of \kataklei&#333;\, old word to shut down like a trap<br>
 door, in N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 3:20. Double use of \te\<br>
 <b><i>(both--and)</i></b>. <B>{Having received authority from the chief priests}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\t&#275;n para t&#333;n archiere&#333;n exousian lab&#333;n\)</i></b>. "The authority," he<br>
 says. Paul was the official persecutor of the saints under the<br>
 direction of the Sanhedrin. He mentions "chief priests"<br>
 <b><i>(Sadducees)</i></b>, though a Pharisee himself. Both parties were<br>
 co-operating against the saints. <B>{And when they were put to<br>
 death}</B> <b><i>(\anairoumen&#333;n te aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute with present<br>
 passive participle of \anaire&#333;\. <B>{I gave my vote against them}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kat&#275;negka ps&#275;phon\)</i></b>. "I cast down my pebble" <b><i>(a black one)</i></b>. The<br>
 ancient Greeks used white pebbles for acquittal <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 2:17)</i></b>,<br>
 black ones for condemnation as here <b><i>(the only two uses of the<br>
 word in the N.T.)</i></b>. Paul's phrase <b><i>(not found elsewhere)</i></b> is more<br>
 vivid than the usual \kataps&#275;phiz&#333;\ for voting. They literally<br>
 cast the pebbles into the urn. Cf. \sumps&#275;phiz&#333;\ in <!-#-->Ac 19:19,<br>
 \sugkatapsephizo\ in <!-#-->Ac 1:26. If Paul's language is taken<br>
 literally here, he was a member of the Sanhedrin and so married<br>
 when he led the persecution. That is quite possible, though he<br>
 was not married when he wrote <!-#-->1Co 7:7f., but a widower. It is<br>
 possible to take the language figuratively for approval, but not<br>
 so natural.<br>
 <br>
 26:11 <B>{Punishing}</B> <b><i>(\tim&#333;r&#333;n\)</i></b>. Old word \tim&#333;re&#333;\ originally to<br>
 render help, to succor <b><i>(\tim&#333;ros\, from \tim&#275;\ and \ouros\)</i></b>, then<br>
 to avenge <b><i>(for honour)</i></b>. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->22:5. <B>{I strove<br>
 to make them blaspheme}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;nagkazon blasph&#275;mein\)</i></b>. Conative<br>
 imperfect active of \anagkaz&#333;\, old verb from \anagk&#275;\<br>
 <b><i>(necessity, compulsion)</i></b>. The tense, like the imperfect in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 3:14; Lu 1:59, leaves room to hope that Paul was not successful<br>
 in this effort, for he had already said that he brought many<br>
 "unto death" <b><i>(<!-#-->22:4)</i></b>. <B>{I persecuted}</B> <b><i>(\edi&#333;kon\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active again, repeated attempts. The old verb \di&#333;k&#333;\ was used to<br>
 run after or chase game and then to chase enemies. The word<br>
 "persecute" is the Latin _persequor_, to follow through or after.<br>
 It is a vivid picture that Paul here paints of his success in<br>
 hunting big game, a grand heresy hunt. <B>{Even unto foreign cities}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai eis ex&#333; poleis\)</i></b>. We know of Damascus, and Paul evidently<br>
 planned to go to other cities outside of Palestine and may even<br>
 have done so before the fateful journey to Damascus.<br>
 <br>
 26:12 <B>{Whereupon}</B> <b><i>(\en hois\)</i></b>. "In which things" <b><i>(affairs of<br>
 persecution)</i></b>, "on which errand." Cf. <!-#-->24:18. Paul made them<br>
 leave Palestine <b><i>(<!-#-->11:19)</i></b> and followed them beyond it <b><i>(<!-#-->9:2)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{With the authority and commission}</B> <b><i>(\met' exousias kai<br>
 epitrop&#275;s\)</i></b>. Not merely "authority" <b><i>(\exousia\)</i></b>, but express<br>
 appointment <b><i>(\epitrop&#275;\, old word, but here only in N.T., derived<br>
 from \epitropos\, steward, and that from \epitrep&#333;\, to turn over<br>
 to, to commit)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 26:13 <B>{At midday}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meras mes&#275;s\)</i></b>. Genitive of time and<br>
 idiomatic use of \mesos\, in the middle of the day, more vivid<br>
 than \mes&#275;mbrian\ <b><i>(<!-#-->22:6)</i></b>. <B>{Above the brightness of the sun}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\huper t&#275;n lamprot&#275;ta tou h&#275;liou\)</i></b>. Here alone not in <!-#-->Ac 9;<br>
 22, though implied in <!-#-->9:3; 22:6, "indicating the supernatural<br>
 character of the light" <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. Luke makes no effort to<br>
 harmonize the exact phrases here with those in the other accounts<br>
 and Paul here <b><i>(verse <!-#-->16)</i></b> blends together what Jesus said to him<br>
 directly and the message of Jesus through Ananias <b><i>(<!-#-->9:15)</i></b>. The<br>
 word \lamprot&#275;s\, old word, is here alone in the N.T. <B>{Shining<br>
 round about me}</B> <b><i>(\perilampsan me\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 participle of \perilamp&#333;\, common _Koin&#275;_ verb, in N.T. only here<br>
 and <!-#-->Lu 2:9.<br>
 <br>
 26:14 <B>{When we were all fallen}</B> <b><i>(\pant&#333;n katapesont&#333;n h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute with second aorist active participle of<br>
 \katapipt&#333;\. In the Hebrew language <b><i>(\t&#275;i Ebraidi dialekt&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Natural addition here, for Paul is speaking in Greek, not Aramaic<br>
 as in <!-#-->22:2. <B>{It is hard for thee to kick against the goad}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\skl&#275;ron soi pros kentra laktizein\)</i></b>. Genuine here, but not in<br>
 chapters <!-#-->9,22. A common proverb as Aeschylus _Ag_. 1624: \Pros<br>
 kentra m&#275; laktize\. "It is taken from an ox that being pricked<br>
 with a goad kicks and receives a severer wound" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. Cf. the<br>
 parables of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 13:35)</i></b>. Blass observes that Paul's<br>
 mention of this Greek and Latin proverb is an indication of his<br>
 culture. Besides he mentions <b><i>(not invents)</i></b> it here rather than in<br>
 chapter <!-#-->22 because of the culture of this audience. \Kentron\<br>
 means either sting as of bees <b><i>(II Macc. 14:19)</i></b> and so of death<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:55)</i></b> or an iron goad in the ploughman's hand as here<br>
 <b><i>(the only two N.T. examples)</i></b>. Note plural here <b><i>(goads)</i></b> and<br>
 \laktizein\ is present active infinitive so that the idea is "to<br>
 keep on kicking against goads." This old verb means to kick with<br>
 the heel <b><i>(adverb \lax\, with the heel)</i></b>, but only here in the N.T.<br>
 There is a papyrus example of kicking <b><i>(\laktiz&#333;\)</i></b> with the feet<br>
 against the door.<br>
 <br>
 26:16 <B>{Arise and stand}</B> <b><i>(\anast&#275;thi kai st&#275;thi\)</i></b>. "Emphatic<br>
 assonance" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. Second aorist active imperative of compound<br>
 verb <b><i>(\anist&#275;mi\)</i></b> and simplex <b><i>(\hist&#275;mi\)</i></b>. "Stand up and take a<br>
 stand." <B>{Have I appeared unto thee}</B> <b><i>(\&#333;phth&#275;n soi\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive indicative of \hora&#333;\. See on &#175;Lu 22:43. <B>{To appoint<br>
 thee}</B> <b><i>(\procheirisasthai se\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->3:30; 22:14 for this verb.<br>
 <B>{Both of the things wherein thou hast seen me}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;n te eides<br>
 me\)</i></b>. The reading \me\ <b><i>(not in all MSS.)</i></b> makes it the object of<br>
 \eides\ <b><i>(didst see)</i></b> and \h&#333;n\ is genitive of \ha\ <b><i>(accusative of<br>
 general reference)</i></b> attracted to the case of the unexpressed<br>
 antecedent \tout&#333;n\. Paul is thus a personal eyewitness of the<br>
 Risen Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:1; 1Co 4:1; 9:1)</i></b>. <B>{And of the things wherein<br>
 I will appear unto thee}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;n te ophth&#275;somai soi\)</i></b>. Here again<br>
 \h&#333;n\ is genitive of the accusative <b><i>(general reference)</i></b> relative<br>
 \ha\ attracted to the case of the antecedent \tout&#333;n\ or<br>
 \ekein&#333;n\ as before. But \ophth&#275;somai\ is first future passive of<br>
 \hora&#333;\ and cannot be treated as active or middle. Page takes it<br>
 to mean "the visions in which I shall be seen by you," the<br>
 passive form bringing out the agency of God. See those in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 18:9; 23:11; 2Co 12:2. The passive voice, however, like<br>
 \apekrith&#275;n\ and \ephob&#275;th&#275;n\, did become sometimes transitive in<br>
 the _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 819)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 26:17 <B>{Delivering thee}</B> <b><i>(\exairoumenos se\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 participle of \exaire&#333;\, old verb and usually so rendered, but<br>
 the old Greek also uses it for "choose" as also in LXX <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa<br>
 48:10)</i></b>. The papyri give examples of both meanings and either<br>
 makes good sense here. God was continually rescuing Paul "out of<br>
 the hands of Jews and Gentiles and Paul was a chosen vessel"<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->9:15)</i></b>. Modern scholars are also divided.<br>
 <br>
 26:18 <B>{To open}</B> <b><i>(\anoixai\)</i></b>. First aorist active infinitive of<br>
 purpose. <B>{That they may turn}</B> <b><i>(\tou epistrepsai\)</i></b>. Another<br>
 infinitive of purpose first aorist active <b><i>(genitive case and<br>
 articular)</i></b>, epexegetic to \anoixai\. <B>{That they may receive}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\tou labein\)</i></b>. Another genitive articular infinitive of purpose<br>
 subordinate <b><i>(epexegetic)</i></b> to \tou epistrepsai\. <B>{Sanctified by<br>
 faith in me}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;giasmenois pistei t&#275;i eis eme\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle of \hagiaz&#333;\, instrumental case of \pistei\, article<br>
 before \eis eme\ <b><i>("by faith, that in me")</i></b>. These important words<br>
 of Jesus to Paul give his justification to this cultured audience<br>
 for his response to the command of Jesus. This was the turning<br>
 point in Paul's career and it was a step forward and upward.<br>
 <br>
 26:19 <B>{Wherefore}</B> <b><i>(\hothen\)</i></b>. This relatival adverb <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->14:26;<br>
 28:13)</i></b> gathers up all that Paul has said. <B>{I was not<br>
 disobedient}</B> <b><i>(\ouk egenom&#275;n apeith&#275;s\)</i></b>. Litotes again, "I did not<br>
 become <b><i>(second aorist middle indicative of \ginomai\)</i></b><br>
 disobedient" <b><i>(\apeith&#275;s\, old word already in <!-#-->Lu 1:17)</i></b>. <B>{Unto<br>
 the heavenly vision}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i ourani&#333;i optasi&#257;i\)</i></b>. A later form of<br>
 \opsis\, from \optaz&#333;\, in LXX, and in N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:22; 24:23; Ac<br>
 26:19; 2Co 12:1)</i></b>. Only time that Paul uses it about seeing<br>
 Christ on the Damascus road, but no reflection on the reality of<br>
 the event.<br>
 <br>
 26:20 <B>{But declared}</B> <b><i>(\alla ap&#275;ggellon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of<br>
 \apaggell&#333;\, repeatedly. <B>{Throughout all the country of Judea}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\p&#257;san te t&#275;n ch&#333;ran t&#275;s Ioudaias\)</i></b>. The accusative here in the<br>
 midst of the datives <b><i>(\tois en Damask&#333;i, Ierosolumois, tois<br>
 ethnesin\)</i></b> seems strange and Page feels certain that \eis\ should<br>
 be here even though absent in Aleph A B. But the accusative of<br>
 extent of space will explain it <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 469)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Doing works worthy of repentance}</B> <b><i>(\axia t&#275;s metanoias erga<br>
 prassontas\)</i></b>. Accusative case of present active participle<br>
 \prassontas\ because of the implied \autous\ with the present<br>
 infinitive \metanoein\ <b><i>(repent)</i></b> and \epistrephein\ <b><i>(turn)</i></b>, though<br>
 the dative \prassousin\ could have been used to agree with<br>
 \ethnesin\ <b><i>(Gentiles)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Mt 3:8 for similar language used of<br>
 the Baptist. Paul, the greatest of theologians, was an<br>
 interesting practical preacher.<br>
 <br>
 26:21 <B>{Assayed to kill me}</B> <b><i>(\epeir&#333;nto diacheirisasthai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Conative imperfect middle of \peira&#333;\, the old form of the later<br>
 _Koin&#275;_ \peiraz&#333;\ so common in the _Koin&#275;_, but in N.T. here<br>
 only. Some MSS. have it in <!-#-->Ac 9:26; Heb 4:15. The old verb<br>
 \diacheiriz&#333;\, to take in hand, middle to lay hands on, to slay,<br>
 occurs in N.T. only here and <!-#-->5:30 which see.<br>
 <br>
 26:22 <B>{Having therefore obtained}</B> <b><i>(\oun tuch&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active participle of old verb \tugchan&#333;\. <B>{The help that is from<br>
 God}</B> <b><i>(\epikourias t&#275;s apo tou theou\)</i></b>. Old word from \epikoure&#333;\,<br>
 to aid, and that from \epikouros\, ally, assister. Only here in<br>
 N.T. God is Paul's ally. All of the plots of the Jews against<br>
 Paul had failed so far. <B>{I stand}</B> <b><i>(\hest&#275;ka\)</i></b>. Second perfect of<br>
 \hist&#275;mi\, to place, intransitive to stand. Picturesque word<br>
 <b><i>(Page)</i></b> of Paul's stability and fidelity <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Php 4:1; Eph<br>
 6:13)</i></b>. <B>{Both to small and great}</B> <b><i>(\mikr&#333;i te kai megal&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Dative singular <b><i>(rather than instrumental, taking \marturoumenos\<br>
 middle, not passive)</i></b> and use of \te kai\ links the two adjectives<br>
 together in an inclusive way. These two adjectives in the<br>
 singular <b><i>(representative singular rather than plural)</i></b> can apply<br>
 to age <b><i>(young and old)</i></b> or to rank <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 11:18)</i></b> as is specially<br>
 suitable here with Festus and Agrippa present. In <!-#-->Ac 8:10 <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb<br>
 8:11)</i></b> the phrase explains \pantes\ <b><i>(all)</i></b>. <B>{Saying nothing but<br>
 what}</B> <b><i>(\ouden ektos leg&#333;n h&#333;n\)</i></b>. "Saying nothing outside of those<br>
 things which." The ablative relative \h&#333;n\ is attracted into the<br>
 case of the unexpressed antecedent \tout&#333;n\ and so ablative after<br>
 \ektos\ <b><i>(adverbial preposition common in LXX, the papyri. In N.T.<br>
 here and <!-#-->1Co 6:18; 15:27; 2Co 12:2f.)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Lu 16:29 about<br>
 Moses and the prophets.<br>
 <br>
 26:23 <B>{How that the Christ must suffer}</B> <b><i>(\ei path&#275;tos ho<br>
 Christos\)</i></b>. Literally, "if the Messiah is subject to suffering."<br>
 \Ei\ can here mean "whether" as in <!-#-->Heb 7:15. This use of a<br>
 verbal in \-tos\ for capability or possibility occurs in the N.T.<br>
 alone in \path&#275;tos\ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 157)</i></b>. This word<br>
 occurs in Plutarch in this sense. It is like the Latin<br>
 _patibilis_ and is from _pasch&#333;_. Here alone in N.T. Paul is<br>
 speaking from the Jewish point of view. Most rabbis had not<br>
 rightly understood <!-#-->Isa 53. When the Baptist called Jesus "the<br>
 Lamb of God" <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:29)</i></b> it was a startling idea. It is not then<br>
 "must suffer" here, but "can suffer." The Cross of Christ was a<br>
 stumbling-block to the rabbis. <B>{How that he first by the<br>
 resurrection of the dead}</B> <b><i>(\ei pr&#333;tos ex anastase&#333;s nekr&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Same construction with \ei\ <b><i>(whether)</i></b>. This point Paul had often<br>
 discussed with the Jews: "whether he <b><i>(the Messiah)</i></b> by a<br>
 resurrection of dead people." Others had been raised from the<br>
 dead, but Christ is the first <b><i>(\pr&#333;tos\)</i></b> who arose from the dead<br>
 and no longer dies <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 6:19)</i></b> and proclaims light <b><i>(\ph&#333;s mellei<br>
 kataggellein\)</i></b>. Paul is still speaking from the Jewish<br>
 standpoint: "is about to <b><i>(going to)</i></b> proclaim light." See verse<br>
 <!-#-->18 for "light" and <!-#-->Lu 2:32. <B>{Both to the people and to the<br>
 Gentiles}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i te la&#333;i kai tois ethnesin\)</i></b>. See verse <!-#-->17. It<br>
 was at the word Gentiles <b><i>(\ethn&#275;\)</i></b> that the mob lost control of<br>
 themselves in the speech from the stairs <b><i>(<!-#-->22:21f.)</i></b>. So it is<br>
 here, only not because of that word, but because of the word<br>
 "resurrection" <b><i>(\anastasis\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 26:24 <B>{As he thus made his defence}</B> <b><i>(\tauta autou<br>
 apologoumenou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again with present middle<br>
 participle. Paul was still speaking when Festus interrupted him<br>
 in great excitement. <B>{With a loud voice}</B> <b><i>(\megal&#275;i t&#275;i ph&#333;n&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Associative instrumental case showing manner <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 530)</i></b> and the predicate use of the adjective, "with<br>
 the voice loud" <b><i>(elevated)</i></b>. <B>{Thou art mad}</B> <b><i>(\main&#275;i\)</i></b>. Old verb<br>
 for raving. See also <!-#-->Joh 10:20; Ac 12:15; 1Co 14:23. The<br>
 enthusiasm of Paul was too much for Festus and then he had spoken<br>
 of visions and resurrection from the dead <b><i>(verse <!-#-->8)</i></b>. "Thou art<br>
 going mad" <b><i>(linear present)</i></b>, Festus means. <B>{Thy much learning<br>
 doth turn thee to madness}</B> <b><i>(\ta polla se grammata eis manian<br>
 peritrepei\)</i></b>. "Is turning thee round." Old verb \peritrep&#333;\, but<br>
 only here in N.T. Festus thought that Paul's "much learning"<br>
 <b><i>(="many letters," cf. <!-#-->Joh 7:15 of Jesus)</i></b> of the Hebrew<br>
 Scriptures to which he had referred was turning his head to<br>
 madness <b><i>(wheels in his head)</i></b> and he was going mad right before<br>
 them all. The old word \mania\ <b><i>(our mania, frenzy, cf. maniac)</i></b><br>
 occurs here only in N.T. Note unusual position of \se\ between<br>
 \polla\ and \grammata\ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 418, 420)</i></b><br>
 <br>
 26:25 <B>{But speak forth}</B> <b><i>(\alla apophtheggomai\)</i></b>. Verb for<br>
 dignified and elevated discourse, a word from the literary<br>
 _Koin&#275;_, not the vernacular. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->2:4,14 which<br>
 see. It occurs three times in Vettius Valens in a "mantic" sense.<br>
 Paul was not ruffled by the rude and excited interruption of<br>
 Festus, but speaks with perfect courtesy in his reply "words of<br>
 truth and soberness." The old word \s&#333;phrosun&#275;\ <b><i>(soundness of<br>
 mind)</i></b> from \s&#333;phr&#333;n\ <b><i>(and that from \s&#333;s\ and \phr&#275;n\)</i></b> is<br>
 directly opposed to "madness" <b><i>(\mania\)</i></b> and in N.T. occurs only<br>
 here and <!-#-->1Ti 2:15.<br>
 <br>
 26:26 <B>{For the king knoweth of these things}</B> <b><i>(\epistatai gar peri<br>
 tout&#333;n ho basileus\)</i></b>. \Epistatai\ <b><i>(present middle probably Ionic<br>
 form of \ephist&#275;mi\)</i></b> is a literary word and suits well here <b><i>(cf.<br>
 <!-#-->24:10)</i></b>. <B>{Freely}</B> <b><i>(\parr&#275;siazomenos\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 participle, speaking fully, making a clean breast of it. From<br>
 \parr&#275;sia\ <b><i>(\pan, rh&#275;sis\)</i></b> <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->13:46)</i></b>. <B>{Is hidden from him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\lanthanein auton\)</i></b>. Escapes his notice. Infinitive in indirect<br>
 discourse after \peithomai\ <b><i>(I am persuaded)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 26:27 <B>{I know that thou believest}</B> <b><i>(\oida hoti pisteueis\)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 had "cornered" Agrippa by this direct challenge. As the Jew in<br>
 charge of the temple he was bound to confess his faith in the<br>
 prophets. But Paul had interpreted the prophets about the Messiah<br>
 in a way that fell in with his claim that Jesus was the Messiah<br>
 risen from the dead. To say, "Yes" would place himself in Paul's<br>
 hands. To say "No" would mean that he did not believe the<br>
 prophets. Agrippa had listened with the keenest interest, but he<br>
 slipped out of the coils with adroitness and a touch of humour.<br>
 <br>
 26:28 <B>{With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a<br>
 Christian}</B> <b><i>(\en olig&#333;i me peitheis Christianon poi&#275;sai\)</i></b>. The<br>
 Authorized rendering is impossible: "Almost thou persuadest me to<br>
 be a Christian." \En olig&#333;i\ does not mean "almost." That would<br>
 require \oligou, par' oligon\, or \dei oligou\. It is not clear,<br>
 however, precisely what \en oligoi\ does mean. It may refer to<br>
 time <b><i>(in little time)</i></b> or a short cut, but that does not suit well<br>
 \en megal&#333;i\ in verse <!-#-->29. Tyndale and Crammer rendered it<br>
 "somewhat" <b><i>(in small measure or degree)</i></b>. There are, alas, many<br>
 "somewhat" Christians. Most likely the idea is "in <b><i>(or with)</i></b><br>
 small effort you are trying to persuade <b><i>(\peitheis\, conative<br>
 present active indicative)</i></b> me in order to make me a Christian."<br>
 This takes the infinitive \poi&#275;sai\ to be purpose <b><i>(Page renders<br>
 it by "so as")</i></b> and thus avoids trying to make \poi&#275;sai\ like<br>
 \genesthai\ <b><i>(become)</i></b>. The aorist is punctiliar action for single<br>
 act, not "perfect." The tone of Agrippa is ironical, but not<br>
 unpleasant. He pushes it aside with a shrug of the shoulders. The<br>
 use of "Christian" is natural here as in the other two instances<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->11:26; 1Pe 4:16)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 26:29 <B>{I would to God}</B> <b><i>(\euxaim&#275;n an t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>. Conclusion of<br>
 fourth-class condition <b><i>(optative with \an\)</i></b>, undetermined with<br>
 less likelihood, the so-called potential optative <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 1021)</i></b>. Polite and courteous wish <b><i>(first aorist<br>
 middle optative of \euchomai\)</i></b>. <B>{Whether with little or with<br>
 much}</B> <b><i>(\kai en mikr&#333;i kai en megal&#333;i\)</i></b>. Literally, "both in<br>
 little and in great," or "both with little and with great pains"<br>
 or "both in some measure and in great measure." Paul takes kindly<br>
 the sarcasm of Agrippa. <B>{Such as I am}</B> <b><i>(\toioutous hopoios kai<br>
 eg&#333; eimi\)</i></b>. Accusative \toioutous\ with the infinitive<br>
 \genesthai\. Paul uses these two qualitative pronouns instead of<br>
 repeating the word "Christian." <B>{Except these bonds}</B> <b><i>(\parektos<br>
 t&#333;n desm&#333;n tout&#333;n\)</i></b>. Ablative case with \parektos\ <b><i>(late<br>
 preposition for the old \parek\)</i></b>. Paul lifts his right manacled<br>
 hand with exquisite grace and good feeling.<br>
 <br>
 26:30 <B>{Rose up}</B> <b><i>(\anest&#275;\)</i></b>. Second aorist active of \anist&#275;mi\<br>
 <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b>, agreeing only with "the king" <b><i>(\ho basileus\)</i></b>.<br>
 The entertainment was over.<br>
 <br>
 26:31 <B>{They spake one to another}</B> <b><i>(\elaloun pros all&#275;lous\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active, describing the eager conversation of the<br>
 dignitaries about Paul's wonderful speech. <B>{Nothing worthy of<br>
 death or bonds}</B> <b><i>(\ouden thanatou &#275; desm&#333;n axion\)</i></b>. This is the<br>
 unanimous conclusion of all these dignitaries <b><i>(Romans, Jews,<br>
 Greeks)</i></b> as it was of Festus before <b><i>(<!-#-->25:25)</i></b>. But Paul had not<br>
 won any of them to Christ. The conclusion leaves Festus in a<br>
 predicament. Why had he not set Paul free before this?<br>
 <br>
 26:32 <B>{This man might have been set at liberty}</B> <b><i>(\Apolelusthai<br>
 edunato ho anthr&#333;pos houtos\)</i></b>. Conclusion of the second class<br>
 condition <b><i>(determined as unfulfilled)</i></b> without \an\ as in <!-#-->24:19<br>
 because of \edunato\ <b><i>(verb of possibility, Robertson, _Grammar_,<br>
 p. 1014)</i></b>. Note perfect passive infinitive \apolelusthai\ from<br>
 \apolu&#333;\. He certainly "could have been set free." Why was it not<br>
 done? <B>{If he had not appealed unto Caesar}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275; epekekl&#275;to<br>
 Kaisara\)</i></b>. Condition of the second class with the past perfect<br>
 middle indicative <b><i>(_op. cit._, p. 1015)</i></b> of \epikale&#333;\ <b><i>(cf.<br>
 <!-#-->25:11f.)</i></b>. But Paul _only_ appealed to Caesar after Festus had<br>
 tried to shift him back to Jerusalem and had refused to set him<br>
 free in Caesarea. Festus comes out with no honour in the case.<br>
 Since Agrippa was a favourite at court perhaps Festus would be<br>
 willing to write favourably to Caesar.<br>
