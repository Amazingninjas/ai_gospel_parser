 <HR>
<p>17:1 <B>{It is impossible}</B> <b><i>(\anendekton estin\)</i></b>. See \ouk<br>
 endechetai\ in <!-#-->13:33. Alpha privative <b><i>(\an-\)</i></b> and \endektos\,<br>
 verbal adjective, from \endechomai\. The word occurs only in late<br>
 Greek and only here in the N.T. The meaning is inadmissible,<br>
 unallowable. <B>{But that occasions of stumbling should come}</B> <b><i>(\tou<br>
 ta skandala m&#275; elthein\)</i></b>. This genitive articular infinitive is<br>
 not easy to explain. In <!-#-->Ac 10:25 there is another example where<br>
 the genitive articular infinitive seems to be used as a<br>
 nominative <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1040)</i></b>. The loose Hebrew<br>
 infinitive construction may have a bearing here, but one may<br>
 recall that the original infinitives were either locatives<br>
 <b><i>(\-eni\)</i></b> or datives <b><i>(\-ai\)</i></b>. \Ta skandala\ is simply the<br>
 accusative of general reference. Literally, the not coming as to<br>
 occasions of stumbling. For \skandalon\ <b><i>(a trap)</i></b> see on &#175;Mt 5:29;<br>
 16:23. It is here only in Luke. The positive form of this saying<br>
 appears in <!-#-->Mt 18:7, which see.<br>
 <br>
 17:2 <B>{It were well for him}</B> <b><i>(\lusitelei aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. An old word, but<br>
 only here in the N.T., from \lusitel&#275;s\ and this from \lu&#333;\, to<br>
 pay, and \ta tel&#275;\, the taxes. So it pays the taxes, it returns<br>
 expenses, it is profitable. Literally here, "It is profitable for<br>
 him" <b><i>(dative case, \aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Matthew has \sumpherei\ <b><i>(it is<br>
 advantageous, bears together for)</i></b>. <B>{If a millstone were hanged}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ei lithos mulikos perikeitai\)</i></b>. Literally, "if a millstone is<br>
 hanged." Present passive indicative from \perikeimai\ <b><i>(to lie or<br>
 be placed around)</i></b>. It is used as a perfect passive of<br>
 \peritith&#275;mi\. So it is a first-class condition, determined as<br>
 fulfilled, not second-class as the English translations imply.<br>
 \Mulikos\ is simply a stone <b><i>(\lithos\)</i></b>, belonging to a mill. Here<br>
 only in the text of Westcott and Hort, not in <!-#-->Mr 9:42 which is<br>
 like <!-#-->Mt 18:6 \mulos onikos\ where the upper millstone is turned<br>
 by an ass, which see. <B>{Were thrown}</B> <b><i>(\erriptai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 indicative from \rhipt&#333;\, old verb. Literally, is thrown or has<br>
 been thrown or cast or hurled. Mark has \bebl&#275;tai\ and Matthew<br>
 \katapontisth&#275;i\, which see, all three verbs vivid and<br>
 expressive. Rather than <b><i>(\&#275;\)</i></b>. The comparative is not here<br>
 expressed before \&#275;\ as one would expect. It is implied in<br>
 \lusitelei\. See the same idiom in <!-#-->Lu 15:7.<br>
 <br>
 17:3 <B>{If thy brother sin}</B> <b><i>(\ean hamart&#275;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> subjunctive in condition of third class.<br>
 <br>
 17:4 <B>{Seven times in a day}</B> <b><i>(\heptakis t&#275;s h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. Seven times<br>
 within the day. On another occasion Peter's question <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 18:21)</i></b><br>
 brought Christ's answer "seventy times seven" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->22)</i></b>, which<br>
 see. Seven times during the day would be hard enough for the same<br>
 offender.<br>
 <br>
 17:5 <B>{Increase}</B> <b><i>(\prosthes\)</i></b>. Second aorist active imperative of<br>
 \prostith&#275;mi\, to add to. Bruce thinks that this sounds much like<br>
 the stereotyped petition in church prayers. A little reflection<br>
 will show that they should answer the prayer themselves.<br>
 <br>
 17:6 <B>{If ye have}</B> <b><i>(\ei echete\)</i></b>. Condition of the first class,<br>
 assumed to be true. <B>{Ye would say}</B> <b><i>(\elegete an\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active with \an\ and so a conclusion <b><i>(apodosis)</i></b> of the second<br>
 class, determined as unfulfilled, a mixed condition therefore.<br>
 <B>{Sycamine tree}</B> <b><i>(\sukamin&#333;i\)</i></b>. At the present time both the black<br>
 mulberry <b><i>(sycamine)</i></b> and the white mulberry <b><i>(sycamore)</i></b> exist in<br>
 Palestine. Luke alone in the N.T. uses either word, the sycamine<br>
 here, the sycamore in <!-#-->19:4. The distinction is not observed in<br>
 the LXX, but it is observed in the late Greek medical writers for<br>
 both trees have medicinal properties. Hence it may be assumed<br>
 that Luke, as a physician, makes the distinction. Both trees<br>
 differ from the English sycamore. In <!-#-->Mt 17:20 we have<br>
 "mountain" in place of "sycamine tree." <B>{Be thou rooted up}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ekriz&#333;th&#275;ti\)</i></b>. First aorist passive imperative as is<br>
 \phuteuth&#275;ti\. <B>{Would have obeyed}</B> <b><i>(\hup&#275;kousen an\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active indicative with \an\, apodosis of a second-class<br>
 condition <b><i>(note aorist tense here, imperfect \elegete\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:7 <B>{Sit down to meat}</B> <b><i>(\anapese\)</i></b>. Recline <b><i>(for the meal)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, fall up <b><i>(or back)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:8 <B>{And will not rather say}</B> <b><i>(\all' ouk erei\)</i></b>. <B>{But will not<br>
 say?}</B> \Ouk\ in a question expects the affirmative answer. <B>{Gird<br>
 thyself}</B> <b><i>(\periz&#333;samenos\)</i></b>. Direct middle first aorist participle<br>
 of \periz&#333;nnumi\, to gird around. <B>{Till I have eaten and drunken}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\he&#333;s phag&#333; kai pi&#333;\)</i></b>. More exactly, till I eat and drink. The<br>
 second aorist subjunctives are not future perfects in any sense,<br>
 simply punctiliar action, effective aorist. <B>{Thou shalt eat and<br>
 drink}</B> <b><i>(\phagesai kai piesai\)</i></b>. Future middle indicative second<br>
 person singular, the uncontracted forms \-esai\ as often in the<br>
 _Koin&#275;_. These futures are from the aorist stems \ephagon\ and<br>
 \epion\ without _sigma_.<br>
 <br>
 17:9 <B>{Does he thank?}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; echei charin;\)</i></b>. \M&#275;\ expects the<br>
 negative answer. \Ech&#333; charin\, to have gratitude toward one, is<br>
 an old Greek idiom <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 1:12; 2Ti 1:3; Heb 12:28)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:10 <B>{Unprofitable}</B> <b><i>(\achreioi\)</i></b>. The Syriac Sinaitic omits<br>
 "unprofitable." The word is common in Greek literature, but in<br>
 the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mt 25:30 where it means "useless" <b><i>(\a\<br>
 privative and \chreios\ from \chraomai\, to use)</i></b>. The slave who<br>
 only does what he is commanded by his master to do has gained no<br>
 merit or credit. "In point of fact it is not commands, but<br>
 demands we have to deal with, arising out of special emergencies"<br>
 <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. The slavish spirit gains no promotion in business life<br>
 or in the kingdom of God.<br>
 <br>
 17:11 <B>{Through the midst of Samaria and Galilee}</B> <b><i>(\dia meson<br>
 Samarias kai Galilaias\)</i></b>. This is the only instance in the N.T.<br>
 of \dia\ with the accusative in the local sense of "through."<br>
 Xenophon and Plato use \dia mesou\ <b><i>(genitive)</i></b>. Jesus was going<br>
 from Ephraim <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 11:54)</i></b> north through the midst of Samaria and<br>
 Galilee so as to cross over the Jordan near Bethshean and join<br>
 the Galilean caravan down through Perea to Jerusalem. The<br>
 Samaritans did not object to people going north away from<br>
 Jerusalem, but did not like to see them going south towards the<br>
 city <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:51-56)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:12 <B>{Which stood afar off}</B> <b><i>(\hoi anest&#275;san porr&#333;then\)</i></b>. The<br>
 margin of Westcott and Hort reads simply \est&#275;san\. The compound<br>
 read by B means "rose up," but they stood at a distance <b><i>(<!-#-->Le<br>
 13:45f.)</i></b>. The first healing of a leper <b><i>(<!-#-->5:12-16)</i></b> like this is<br>
 given by Luke only.<br>
 <br>
 17:13 <B>{Lifted up}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;ran\)</i></b>. First aorist active of the liquid<br>
 verb \air&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 17:14 <B>{As they went}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i hupagein autous\)</i></b>. Favourite Lukan<br>
 idiom of \en\ with articular infinitive as in <!-#-->17:11 and often.<br>
 <br>
 17:16 <B>{And he was a Samaritan}</B> <b><i>(\kai autos &#275;n Samareit&#275;s\)</i></b>. This<br>
 touch colours the whole incident. The one man who felt grateful<br>
 enough to come back and thank Jesus for the blessing was a<br>
 despised Samaritan. The \autos\ has point here.<br>
 <br>
 17:18 <B>{Save this stranger}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275; ho allogen&#275;s\)</i></b>. The old word<br>
 was \allophulos\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10:28)</i></b>, but \allogen&#275;s\ occurs in the LXX,<br>
 Josephus, and inscriptions. Deissmann <b><i>(_Light from the Ancient<br>
 East_, p. 80)</i></b> gives the inscription from the limestone block from<br>
 the Temple of Israel in Jerusalem which uses this very word which<br>
 may have been read by Jesus: <B>{Let no foreigner enter within the<br>
 screen and enclosure surrounding the sanctuary}</B> <b><i>(\M&#275;thena<br>
 allogen&#275; eisporeuesthai entos tou peri to hieron truphaktou kai<br>
 peribolou\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:20 <B>{With observation}</B> <b><i>(\meta parat&#275;se&#333;s\)</i></b>. Late Greek word<br>
 from \parat&#275;re&#333;\, to watch closely. Only here in the N.T. Medical<br>
 writers use it of watching the symptoms of disease. It is used<br>
 also of close astronomical observations. But close watching of<br>
 external phenomena will not reveal the signs of the kingdom of<br>
 God.<br>
 <br>
 17:21 <B>{Within you}</B> <b><i>(\entos hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. This is the obvious, and, as<br>
 I think, the necessary meaning of \entos\. The examples cited of<br>
 the use of \entos\ in Xenophon and Plato where \entos\ means<br>
 "among" do not bear that out when investigated. Field <b><i>(_Ot.<br>
 Norv_.)</i></b> "contends that there is no clear instance of \entos\ in<br>
 the sense of among" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>, and rightly so. What Jesus says to<br>
 the Pharisees is that they, as others, are to look for the<br>
 kingdom of God within themselves, not in outward displays and<br>
 supernatural manifestations. It is not a localized display "Here"<br>
 or "There." It is in this sense that in <!-#-->Lu 11:20 Jesus spoke of<br>
 the kingdom of God as "come upon you" <b><i>(\ephthasen eph' hum&#257;s\)</i></b>,<br>
 speaking to Pharisees. The only other instance of \entos\ in the<br>
 N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 23:26)</i></b> necessarily means "within" <b><i>("the inside of the<br>
 cup")</i></b>. There is, beside, the use of \entos\ meaning "within" in<br>
 the Oxyrhynchus Papyrus saying of Jesus of the Third Century<br>
 <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient East_, p. 426)</i></b> which is<br>
 interesting: "The kingdom of heaven is within you" <b><i>(\entos hum&#333;n\<br>
 as here in <!-#-->Lu 17:21)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:23 <B>{Go not away nor follow after them}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; apelth&#275;te m&#275;de<br>
 di&#333;x&#275;te\)</i></b>. Westcott and Hort bracket \apelth&#275;te m&#275;de\. Note<br>
 aorist subjunctive with \m&#275;\ in prohibition, ingressive aorist.<br>
 Do not rush after those who set times and places for the second<br>
 advent. The Messiah was already present in the first advent<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->21)</i></b> though the Pharisees did not know it.<br>
 <br>
 17:24 <B>{Lighteneth}</B> <b><i>(\astraptousa\)</i></b>. An old and common verb,<br>
 though only here and <!-#-->24:4 in the N.T. The second coming will be<br>
 sudden and universally visible. There are still some poor souls<br>
 who are waiting in Jerusalem under the delusion that Jesus will<br>
 come there and nowhere else.<br>
 <br>
 17:25 <B>{But first}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;ton de\)</i></b>. The second coming will be only<br>
 after the Cross.<br>
 <br>
 17:27 <B>{They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in<br>
 marriage}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;sthion, epinon, egamoun, egamizonto\)</i></b>. Imperfects<br>
 all of them vividly picturing the life of the time of Noah. But<br>
 the other tenses are aorists <b><i>(Noah entered \eis&#275;lthen\, the flood<br>
 came \&#275;lthen\, destroyed \ap&#333;lesen\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:28 Note the same sharp contrast between the imperfects here<br>
 <b><i>(<B>{ate}</B> \&#275;sthion\, <B>{drank}</B> \epinon\, <B>{bought}</B> \&#275;gorazon\, <B>{sold}</B><br>
 \ep&#333;loun\, <B>{planted}</B> \ephuteuon\, <B>{builded}</B> \&#333;ikodomoun\)</i></b> and the<br>
 aorists in verse <!-#-->29 <b><i>(<B>{went out}</B> \ex&#275;lthen\, <B>{rained}</B> \ebrexen\,<br>
 <B>{destroyed}</B> \ap&#333;lesen\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:30 <B>{Is revealed}</B> <b><i>(\apokaluptetai\)</i></b>. Prophetic and futuristic<br>
 present passive indicative.<br>
 <br>
 17:31 <B>{Let him not go down}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; katabat&#333;\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 imperative of \katabain&#333;\ with \m&#275;\ in a prohibition in the third<br>
 person singular. The usual idiom here would be \m&#275;\ and the<br>
 aorist subjunctive. See <!-#-->Mr 13:15f.; Mt 24:17f. when these words<br>
 occur in the great eschatological discussion concerning flight<br>
 before the destruction of Jerusalem. Here the application is<br>
 "absolute indifference to all worldly interests as the attitude<br>
 of readiness for the Son of Man" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:32 <B>{Remember Lot's wife}</B> <b><i>(\mn&#275;moneuete t&#275;s gunaikos L&#333;t\)</i></b>.<br>
 Here only in the N.T. A pertinent illustration to warn against<br>
 looking back with yearning after what has been left behind <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge<br>
 19:26)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:33 <B>{Shall preserve it}</B> <b><i>(\z&#333;ogon&#275;sei aut&#275;n\)</i></b>. Or save it alive.<br>
 Here only in the N.T. except <!-#-->1Ti 6:13; Ac 7:19. It is a late<br>
 word and common in medical writers, to bring forth alive <b><i>(\z&#333;os,<br>
 gen&#333;\)</i></b> and here to keep alive.<br>
 <br>
 17:34 <B>{In that night}</B> <b><i>(\taut&#275;i t&#275;i nukti\)</i></b>. More vivid still, "on<br>
 this night," when Christ comes.<br>
 <br>
 17:35 <B>{Shall be grinding}</B> <b><i>(\esontai al&#275;thousai\)</i></b>. Periphrastic<br>
 future active indicative of \al&#275;th&#333;\, an old verb only in the<br>
 N.T. here and <!-#-->Mt 24:41. <B>{Together}</B> <b><i>(\epi to auto\)</i></b>. In the same<br>
 place, near together as in <!-#-->Ac 2:1.<br>
 <br>
 17:37 <B>{The eagles}</B> <b><i>(\hoi aetoi\)</i></b>. Or the vultures attracted by<br>
 the carcass. This proverb is quoted also in <!-#-->Mt 24:28. See <!-#-->Job<br>
 39:27-30; Heb 1:8; Ho 8:1. Double compound <b><i>(\epi-sun-\)</i></b> in<br>
 \epi-sun-achth&#275;sontai\ completes the picture.<br>
