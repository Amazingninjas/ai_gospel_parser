<p>20:1 <B>{After the uproar was ceased}</B> <b><i>(\meta to pausasthai ton<br>
 thorubon\)</i></b>. Literally, after the ceasing <b><i>(accusative of articular<br>
 aorist middle infinitive of \pau&#333;\, to make cease)</i></b> as to the<br>
 uproar <b><i>(accusative of general reference)</i></b>. Noise and riot, already<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 26:5; 27:24; Mr 5:38; 14:2; and see in <!-#-->Ac 21:34; 24:18.<br>
 Pictures the whole incident as bustle and confusion. <B>{Took leave}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aspamenos\)</i></b>. First aorist middle participle of \aspazomai\, old<br>
 verb from \a\ intensive and \spa&#333;\, to draw, to draw to oneself<br>
 in embrace either in greeting or farewell. Here it is in farewell<br>
 as in <!-#-->21:6. Salutation in <!-#-->21:7,19. <B>{Departed for to go into<br>
 Macedonia}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#275;lthen poreuesthai eis Makedonian\)</i></b>. Both verbs,<br>
 single act and then process. Luke here condenses what was<br>
 probably a whole year of Paul's life and work as we gather from<br>
 II Corinthians, one of Paul's "weighty and powerful" letters as<br>
 his enemies called them <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 10:10)</i></b>. "This epistle more than<br>
 any other is a revelation of S. Paul's own heart: it is his<br>
 spiritual autobiography and _apologia pro vita sua_."<br>
 <br>
 20:2 <B>{Those parts}</B> <b><i>(\ta mer&#275; ekeina\)</i></b>. We have no way of knowing<br>
 why Luke did not tell of Paul's stay in Troas <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 2:12f.)</i></b> nor<br>
 of meeting Titus in Macedonia <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 2:13-7:16)</i></b> nor of Paul's<br>
 visit to Illyricum <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 15:19f.)</i></b> to give time for II Corinthians<br>
 to do its work <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 13)</i></b>, one of the most stirring experiences<br>
 in Paul's whole career when he opened his heart to the<br>
 Corinthians and won final victory in the church by the help of<br>
 Titus who also helped him round up the great collection in<br>
 Achaia. He wrote II Corinthians during this period after Titus<br>
 arrived from Corinth. The unity of II Corinthians is here<br>
 assumed. Paul probably met Luke again in Macedonia, but all this<br>
 is passed by except by the general phrase: "had given them much<br>
 exhortation" <b><i>(\parakalesas autous log&#333;i poll&#333;i\)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 "having exhorted them <b><i>(the Macedonian brethren)</i></b> with much talk"<br>
 <b><i>(instrumental case)</i></b>. <B>{Into Greece}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n Hellada\)</i></b>. That is,<br>
 Achaia <b><i>(<!-#-->18:12; 19:21)</i></b>, and particularly Corinth, whither he had<br>
 at last come again after repeated attempts, pauses, and delays<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 13:1)</i></b>. Now at last the coast was clear and Paul apparently<br>
 had an open door in Corinth during these three months, so<br>
 completely had Titus at last done away with the opposition of the<br>
 Judaizers there.<br>
 <br>
 20:3 <B>{When he had spent three months there}</B> <b><i>(\poi&#275;sas m&#275;nas<br>
 treis\)</i></b>. Literally, "having done three months," the same idiom in<br>
 <!-#-->Ac 14:33; 18:23; Jas 5:13. During this period Paul may have<br>
 written Galatians as Lightfoot argued and certainly did Romans.<br>
 We do not have to say that Luke was ignorant of Paul's work<br>
 during this period, only that he did not choose to enlarge upon<br>
 it. <B>{And a plot was laid against him by the Jews}</B> <b><i>(\genomen&#275;s<br>
 epiboul&#275;s aut&#333;i hupo t&#333;n Ioudai&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute, "a plot<br>
 by the Jews having come against him." \Epiboul&#275;\ is an old word<br>
 for a plot against one. In the N.T. only in Acts <b><i>(<!-#-->9:24; 20:3,19;<br>
 23:30)</i></b>. Please note that this plot is by the Jews, not the<br>
 Judaizers whom Paul discusses so vehemently in <!-#-->2Co 10-13. They<br>
 had given Paul much anguish of heart as is shown in I Cor. and in<br>
 <!-#-->2Co 1-7, but that trouble seems now past. It is Paul's old<br>
 enemies in Corinth who had cherished all these years their defeat<br>
 at the hands of Gallio <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:5-17)</i></b> who now took advantage of<br>
 Paul's plans for departure to compass his death if possible. <B>{As<br>
 he was about to set sail for Syria}</B> <b><i>(\mellonti anagesthai eis t&#275;n<br>
 Surian\)</i></b>. The participle \mellonti\ agrees in case <b><i>(dative)</i></b> with<br>
 \aut&#333;i\. For the sense of intending see also verse <!-#-->13.<br>
 \Anagesthai\ <b><i>(present middle infinitive)</i></b> is the common word for<br>
 putting out to sea <b><i>(going up, they said, from land)</i></b> as in<br>
 <!-#-->13:13. <B>{He determined}</B> <b><i>(\egeneto gn&#333;m&#275;s\)</i></b>. The best MSS. here<br>
 read \gn&#333;m&#275;s\ <b><i>(predicate ablative of source like \epiluse&#333;s\,<br>
 <!-#-->2Pe 1:20, Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 514)</i></b>, not \gn&#333;m&#275;\<br>
 <b><i>(nominative)</i></b>. "He became of opinion." The Jews had heard of<br>
 Paul's plan to sail for Syria and intended in the hurly-burly<br>
 either to kill him at the docks in Cenchreae or to push him<br>
 overboard from the crowded pilgrim ship bound for the passover.<br>
 Fortunately Paul learned of their plot and so eluded them by<br>
 going through Macedonia. The Codex Bezae adds here that "the<br>
 Spirit bade him return into Macedonia."<br>
 <br>
 20:4 <B>{Accompanied him}</B> <b><i>(\suneipeto aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Imperfect of<br>
 \sunepomai\, old and common verb, but only here in the N.T. The<br>
 singular is used agreeing with the first name mentioned<br>
 \S&#333;patros\ and to be supplied with each of the others. Textus<br>
 Receptus adds here "into Asia" <b><i>(\achri t&#275;s Asias\, as far as<br>
 Asia)</i></b>, but the best documents <b><i>(Aleph B Vulg. Sah Boh)</i></b> do not have<br>
 it. As a matter of fact, Trophimus went as far as Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 21:29)</i></b> and Aristarchus as far as Rome <b><i>(<!-#-->27:2; Col 4:10)</i></b>, The<br>
 phrase could apply only to Sopatros. It is not clear though<br>
 probable that Luke means to say that these seven brethren,<br>
 delegates of the various churches <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 8:19-23)</i></b> started from<br>
 Corinth with Paul. Luke notes the fact that they accompanied<br>
 Paul, but the party may really have been made up at Philippi<br>
 where Luke himself joined Paul, the rest of the party having gone<br>
 on to Troas <b><i>(<!-#-->20:5f.)</i></b>. These were from Roman provinces that<br>
 shared in the collection <b><i>(Galatia, Asia, Macedonia, Achaia)</i></b>. In<br>
 this list three were from Macedonia, Sopater of Beroea,<br>
 Aristarchus and Secundus of Thessalonica; two from Galatia, Gaius<br>
 of Derbe and Timothy of Lystra; two from Asia, Tychicus and<br>
 Trophimus. It is a bit curious that none are named from Achaia.<br>
 Had Corinth failed after all <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 8; 9)</i></b> to raise its share of<br>
 the collection after such eager pledging? Rackham suggests that<br>
 they may have turned their part over directly to Paul. Luke<br>
 joined Paul in Philippi and could have handled the money from<br>
 Achaia. It was an important event and Paul took the utmost pains<br>
 to remove any opportunity for scandal in the handling of the<br>
 funds.<br>
 <br>
 20:5 <B>{Were waiting for us in Troas}</B> <b><i>(\emenon h&#275;m&#257;s en Troiadi\)</i></b>.<br>
 Here again we have "us" for the first time since chapter 16 where<br>
 Paul was with Luke in Philippi. Had Luke remained all this time<br>
 in Philippi? We do not know, but he is with Paul now till Rome is<br>
 reached. The seven brethren of verse <!-#-->4 went on ahead from<br>
 Philippi to Troas while Paul remained with Luke in Philippi.<br>
 <br>
 20:6 <B>{After the days of unleavened bread}</B> <b><i>(\meta tas h&#275;mer&#257;s t&#333;n<br>
 azum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Paul was a Jew, though a Christian, and observed the<br>
 Jewish feasts, though he protested against Gentiles being forced<br>
 to do it <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 4:10; Col 2:16)</i></b>. Was Luke a proselyte because he<br>
 notes the Jewish feasts as here and in <!-#-->Ac 27:9? He may have<br>
 noted them merely because Paul observed them. But this passover<br>
 was a year after that in Ephesus when Paul expected to remain<br>
 there till Pentecost <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 16:8)</i></b>. He was hoping now to reach<br>
 Jerusalem by Pentecost <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:16)</i></b> as he did. We do not know the<br>
 precise year, possibly A.D. 56 or 57. <B>{In five days}</B> <b><i>(\achri<br>
 h&#275;mer&#333;n pente\)</i></b>. Up to five days <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Lu 2:37)</i></b>. D has<br>
 \pemptaioi\, "fifth day men," a correct gloss. Cf. \deuteraioi\,<br>
 second-day men <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 28:13)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Ac 16:11 they made the voyage<br>
 in two days. Probably adverse winds held them back here. <B>{Seven<br>
 days}</B> <b><i>(\hepta h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. To atone for the short stay in Troas<br>
 before <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 2:12f.)</i></b> when Paul was so restless. Now he preaches<br>
 a week to them.<br>
 <br>
 20:7 <B>{Upon the first day of the week}</B> <b><i>(\en de mi&#257;i t&#333;n<br>
 sabbat&#333;n\)</i></b>. The cardinal \mi&#257;i\ used here for the ordinal<br>
 \pr&#333;t&#275;i\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 16:9)</i></b> like the Hebrew _ehadh_ as in <!-#-->Mr 16:2; Mt<br>
 28:1; Lu 24:1; Joh 20:1 and in harmony with the _Koin&#275;_ idiom<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 671)</i></b>. Either the singular <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 16:9)</i></b><br>
 \sabbatou\ or the plural \sabbaton\ as here was used for the week<br>
 <b><i>(sabbath to sabbath)</i></b>. For the first time here we have services<br>
 mentioned on the first day of the week though in <!-#-->1Co 16:2 it is<br>
 implied by the collections stored on that day. In <!-#-->Re 1:10 the<br>
 Lord's day seems to be the day of the week on which Jesus rose<br>
 from the grave. Worship on the first day of the week instead of<br>
 the seventh naturally arose in Gentile churches, though <!-#-->Joh<br>
 20:26 seems to mean that from the very start the disciples began<br>
 to meet on the first <b><i>(or eighth)</i></b> day. But liberty was allowed as<br>
 Paul makes plain in <!-#-->Ro 14:5f. <B>{When we were gathered together}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sun&#275;gmen&#333;n h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute, perfect passive<br>
 participle of \sunag&#333;\, to gather together, a formal meeting of<br>
 the disciples. See this verb used for gatherings of disciples in<br>
 <!-#-->Ac 4:31; 11:26; 14:27; 15:6,30; 19:7,8; 1Co 5:4. In <!-#-->Heb 10:25<br>
 the substantive \episunag&#333;g&#275;n\ is used for the regular gatherings<br>
 which some were already neglecting. It is impossible for a church<br>
 to flourish without regular meetings even if they have to meet in<br>
 the catacombs as became necessary in Rome. In Russia today the<br>
 Soviets are trying to break up conventicles of Baptists. They<br>
 probably met on our Saturday evening, the beginning of the first<br>
 day at sunset. So these Christians began the day <b><i>(Sunday)</i></b> with<br>
 worship. But, since this is a Gentile community, it is quite<br>
 possible that Luke means our Sunday evening as the time when this<br>
 meeting occurs, and the language in <!-#-->Joh 20:19 "it being evening<br>
 on that day the first day of the week" naturally means the<br>
 evening following the day, not the evening preceding the day. <B>{To<br>
 break bread}</B> <b><i>(\klasai arton\)</i></b>. First aorist active infinitive of<br>
 purpose of \kla&#333;\. The language naturally bears the same meaning<br>
 as in <!-#-->2:42, the Eucharist or the Lord's Supper which usually<br>
 followed the \Agap&#275;\. See <!-#-->1Co 10:16. The time came, when the<br>
 \Agap&#275;\ was no longer observed, perhaps because of the abuses<br>
 noted in <!-#-->1Co 11:20ff. Rackham argues that the absence of the<br>
 article with bread here and its presence <b><i>(\ton arton\)</i></b> in verse<br>
 <!-#-->11 shows that the \Agap&#275;\ is ] referred to in verse <!-#-->7 and the<br>
 Eucharist in verse <!-#-->11, but not necessarily so because \ton<br>
 arton\ may merely refer to \arton\ in verse <!-#-->7. At any rate it<br>
 should be noted that Paul, who conducted this service, was not a<br>
 member of the church in Troas, but only a visitor. <B>{Discoursed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dielegeto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle because he kept on at length.<br>
 <B>{Intending}</B> <b><i>(\mell&#333;\)</i></b>. Being about to, on the point of. <B>{On the<br>
 morrow}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i epaurion\)</i></b>. Locative case with \h&#275;mer&#257;i\ understood<br>
 after the adverb \epaurion\. If Paul spoke on our Saturday<br>
 evening, he made the journey on the first day of the week <b><i>(our<br>
 Sunday)</i></b> after sunrise. If he spoke on our Sunday evening, then he<br>
 left on our Monday morning. <B>{Prolonged his speech}</B> <b><i>(\Pareteinen<br>
 ton logon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active <b><i>(same form as aorist)</i></b> of<br>
 \paratein&#333;\, old verb to stretch beside or lengthwise, to<br>
 prolong. Vivid picture of Paul's long sermon which went on and on<br>
 till midnight <b><i>(\mechri mesonuktiou\)</i></b>. Paul's purpose to leave<br>
 early next morning seemed to justify the long discourse.<br>
 Preachers usually have some excuse for the long sermon which is<br>
 not always clear to the exhausted audience.<br>
 <br>
 20:8 <B>{Many lights}</B> <b><i>(\lampades hikanai\)</i></b>. It was dark at night<br>
 since the full moon <b><i>(passover)</i></b> was three weeks behind. These<br>
 lamps were probably filled with oil and had wicks that flickered<br>
 and smoked. They would not meet in the dark. <B>{In the upper room}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\en t&#333;i huper&#333;i&#333;i\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->1:13 which see.<br>
 <br>
 20:9 <B>{Sat}</B> <b><i>(\kathezomenos\)</i></b>. Sitting <b><i>(present middle participle<br>
 describing his posture)</i></b>. <B>{In the window}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;s thuridos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Old word diminutive from \thura\, door, a little door. Latticed<br>
 window <b><i>(no glass)</i></b> opened because of the heat from the lamps and<br>
 the crowd. Our window was once spelt _windore_ <b><i>(Hudibras)</i></b>,<br>
 perhaps from the wrong idea that it was derived from _wind_ and<br>
 _door_. Eutychus <b><i>(a common slave name)</i></b> was sitting on <b><i>(\epi\)</i></b> the<br>
 window sill. Ahaziah "fell down through a lattice in his upper<br>
 chamber" <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ki 1:2)</i></b>. In the N.T. \thuris\ only here and <!-#-->2Co<br>
 11:33 <b><i>(\dia thuridos\)</i></b> through which Paul was let down through<br>
 the wall in Damascus. <B>{Borne down with deep sleep}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katapheromenos hupn&#333;i bathei\)</i></b>. Present passive participle of<br>
 \katapher&#333;\, to bear down, and followed by instrumental case<br>
 <b><i>(\hupn&#333;i\)</i></b>. Describes the gradual process of going into deep<br>
 sleep. Great medical writers use \bathus\ with \hupnos\ as we do<br>
 today <b><i>(deep sleep)</i></b>. D here has \basei\ <b><i>(heavy)</i></b> for \bathei\<br>
 <b><i>(deep)</i></b>. <B>{As Paul discoursed yet longer}</B> <b><i>(\dialegomenou tou Paulou<br>
 epi pleion\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute of present middle participle of<br>
 \dialegomai\ <b><i>(cf. verse <!-#-->7)</i></b>. with \epi pleion\. Eutychus<br>
 struggled bravely to keep awake, vainly hoping that Paul would<br>
 finish. But he went on "for more." <B>{Being born down by his sleep}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katenechtheis apo tou hupnou\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b><br>
 passive showing the final result of the process described by<br>
 \katapheromenos\, finally overcome as a result of <b><i>(\apo\)</i></b> the<br>
 <b><i>(note article \tou\)</i></b> sleep <b><i>(ablative case)</i></b>. These four<br>
 participles <b><i>(\kathezomenos, katapheromenos, dialegomenou,<br>
 katenechtheis\)</i></b> have no connectives, but are distinguished<br>
 clearly by case and tense. The difference between the present<br>
 \katapheromenos\ and the aorist \katenechtheis\ of the same verb<br>
 is marked. <B>{Fell down}</B> <b><i>(\epesen kat&#333;\)</i></b>. Effective aorist active<br>
 indicative of \pipt&#333;\ with the adverb \kat&#333;\, though \katapipt&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(compound verb)</i></b> could have been used <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 26:14; 28:6)</i></b>. Hobart<br>
 <b><i>(_Medical Language of St. Luke_)</i></b> thinks that Luke shows a<br>
 physician's interest in the causes of the drowsiness of Eutychus<br>
 <b><i>(the heat, the crowd, the smell of the lamps, the late hour, the<br>
 long discourse)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Lu 22:45. <B>{From the third story}</B> <b><i>(\apo tou<br>
 tristegou\)</i></b>. From \treis\ <b><i>(three)</i></b> and \steg&#275;\ <b><i>(roof)</i></b>, adjective<br>
 \tristegos\ having three roofs. <B>{Was taken up dead}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rth&#275;<br>
 nekros\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of \air&#333;\. Luke does<br>
 not say \h&#333;s\ <b><i>(as)</i></b> or \h&#333;sei\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 9:26 as if)</i></b>. The people<br>
 considered him dead and Luke the physician seems to agree with<br>
 that view.<br>
 <br>
 20:10 <B>{Fell on him}</B> <b><i>(\epepesen aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative of \epipipt&#333;\ with dative case as Elijah did <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ki<br>
 17:21)</i></b> and Elisha <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ki 4:34)</i></b>. <B>{Embracing}</B> <b><i>(\sunperilab&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist active participle of \sunperilamban&#333;\, old verb to<br>
 embrace completely <b><i>(take hold together round)</i></b>, but only here in<br>
 the N.T. In <!-#-->Ezr 5:3. <B>{Make ye no ado}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; thorubeisthe\)</i></b>. Stop<br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275;\ and present middle imperative of \thorube&#333;\)</i></b> making a noise<br>
 <b><i>(\thorubos\)</i></b> as the people did on the death of Jairus's daughter<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 9:23 \thoruboumenou\ and <!-#-->Mr 5:38 \thorubou\)</i></b> when Jesus<br>
 asked \Ti thorubeisthe?\ <B>{For his life is in him}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; gar psuch&#275;<br>
 autou en aut&#333;i estin\)</i></b>. This language is relied on by Ramsay,<br>
 Wendt, Zoeckler to show that Eutychus had not really died, but<br>
 had merely swooned. Paul's language would suit that view, but it<br>
 suits equally well the idea that he had just been restored to<br>
 life and so is indecisive. Furneaux urges also the fact that his<br>
 friends did not bring him back to the meeting till morning <b><i>(verse<br>
 <!-#-->12)</i></b> as additional evidence that it was a case of swooning<br>
 rather than of death. But this again is not conclusive as they<br>
 would naturally not take him back at once. One will believe here<br>
 as the facts appeal to him.<br>
 <br>
 20:11 <B>{When he was gone up}</B> <b><i>(\anabas\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle in sharp contrast to \katabas\ <b><i>(went down)</i></b> of verse<br>
 <!-#-->10. <B>{Had broken bread}</B> <b><i>(\klasas ton arton\)</i></b>. Probably the<br>
 Eucharist to observe which ordinance Paul had come and tarried<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->7)</i></b>, though some scholars distinguish between what took<br>
 place in verse <!-#-->7 and verse <!-#-->11, needlessly so as was stated on<br>
 verse <!-#-->7. <B>{And eaten}</B> <b><i>(\kai geusamenos\)</i></b>. The word is used in<br>
 <!-#-->10:10 of eating an ordinary meal and so might apply to the<br>
 \Agap&#275;\, but it suits equally for the Eucharist. The accident had<br>
 interrupted Paul's sermon so that it was observed now and then<br>
 Paul resumed his discourse. <B>{And had talked with them a long<br>
 while}</B> <b><i>(\eph' hikanon te homil&#275;sas\)</i></b>. Luke, as we have seen, is<br>
 fond of \hikanos\ for periods of time, for a considerable space<br>
 of time, "even till break of day" <b><i>(\achri aug&#275;s\)</i></b>. Old word for<br>
 brightness, radiance like German _Auge_, English eye, only here<br>
 in the N.T. Occurs in the papyri and in modern Greek for dawn.<br>
 This second discourse lasted from midnight till dawn and was<br>
 probably more informal <b><i>(as in <!-#-->10:27)</i></b> and conversational<br>
 <b><i>(\homil&#275;sas\, though our word homiletics comes from \homile&#333;\)</i></b><br>
 than the discourse before midnight <b><i>(\dialegomai\, verses <!-#-->7,9)</i></b>.<br>
 He had much to say before he left. <B>{So he departed}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s<br>
 ex&#275;lthen\)</i></b>. Thus Luke sums up the result. Paul left <b><i>(went forth)</i></b><br>
 only after all the events narrated by the numerous preceding<br>
 participles had taken place. Effective aorist active indicative<br>
 \exelthen\. \Hout&#333;s\ here equals \tum demum\, now at length <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 27:7)</i></b> as Page shows.<br>
 <br>
 20:12 <B>{They brought the lad alive}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;gagon ton paida z&#333;nta\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist active indicative of \ag&#333;\. Evidently the special<br>
 friends of the lad who now either brought him back to the room or<br>
 <b><i>(Rendall)</i></b> took him home to his family. Knowling holds that<br>
 \z&#333;nta\ <b><i>(living)</i></b> here is pointless unless he had been dead. He<br>
 had been taken up dead and now they brought him living. <B>{Not a<br>
 little}</B> <b><i>(\ou metri&#333;s\)</i></b>. Not moderately, that is a great deal.<br>
 Luke is fond of this use of the figure _litotes_ <b><i>(use of the<br>
 negative)</i></b> instead of the strong positive <b><i>(<!-#-->1:5, etc.)</i></b>. D <b><i>(Codex<br>
 Bezae)</i></b> has here instead of \&#275;gagon\ these words: \alpazomen&#333;n de<br>
 aut&#333;n &#275;gagen ton neaniskon z&#333;nta\ <b><i>(while they were saying<br>
 farewell he brought the young man alive)</i></b>. This reading pictures<br>
 the joyful scene over the lad's restoration as Paul was leaving.<br>
 <br>
 20:13 <B>{To the ship}</B> <b><i>(\epi to ploion\)</i></b>. Note article. It is<br>
 possible that Paul's party had chartered a coasting vessel from<br>
 Philippi or Troas to take them to Patara in Lycia. Hence the boat<br>
 stopped when and where Paul wished. That is possible, but not<br>
 certain, for Paul could simply have accommodated himself to the<br>
 plans of the ship's managers. <B>{To take in Paul}</B> <b><i>(\analambanein<br>
 ton Paulon\)</i></b>. So in verse <!-#-->14. Same use in <!-#-->2Ti 4:11: "Picking<br>
 up Mark" <b><i>(\Markon analab&#333;n\)</i></b>. Assos was a seaport south of Troas<br>
 in Mysia in the province of Asia. <B>{He had appointed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\diatetagmenos &#275;n\)</i></b>. Past perfect periphrastic middle of<br>
 \diatass&#333;\, old verb to give orders <b><i>(military in particular)</i></b>. <B>{To<br>
 go by land}</B> <b><i>(\pezeuein\)</i></b>. Present active infinitive of \pezeu&#333;\,<br>
 old verb to go on foot, not on horse back or in a carriage or by<br>
 ship. Here only in the N.T. It was about twenty miles over a<br>
 paved Roman road, much shorter <b><i>(less than half)</i></b> than the sea<br>
 voyage around Cape Lectum. It was a beautiful walk in the<br>
 spring-time and no doubt Paul enjoyed it whatever his reason was<br>
 for going thus to Assos while the rest went by sea. Certainly he<br>
 was entitled to a little time alone, this one day, as Jesus<br>
 sought the Father in the night watches <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 14:23)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 20:14 <B>{Met us}</B> <b><i>(\suneballen h&#275;min\)</i></b>. Imperfect active where the<br>
 aorist <b><i>(\sunebalen\, as C D have it)</i></b> would seem more natural. It<br>
 may mean that as soon as <b><i>(\h&#333;s\)</i></b> Paul "came near or began to meet<br>
 us" <b><i>(inchoative imperfect)</i></b>, we picked him up. Luke alone in the<br>
 N.T. uses \sunball&#333;\ to bring or come together either in a<br>
 friendly sense as here or as enemies <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 14:31)</i></b>. <B>{To Mitylene}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eis Mitul&#275;n&#275;n\)</i></b>. The capital of Lesbos about thirty miles from<br>
 Assos, an easy day's sailing.<br>
 <br>
 20:15 <B>{We came over against Chios}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;nt&#275;samen antikrus<br>
 Chiou\)</i></b>. Luke uses this _Koin&#275;_ verb several times <b><i>(<!-#-->16:1;<br>
 18:19)</i></b>, meaning to come right down in front of and the notion of<br>
 \anta\ is made plainer by \antikrus\, face to face with, common<br>
 "improper" preposition only here in the N.T. They probably lay<br>
 off the coast <b><i>(anchoring)</i></b> during the night instead of putting<br>
 into the harbour. The Island of Chios is about eight miles from<br>
 the mainland. <B>{The next day}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i heter&#257;i\)</i></b>. The third day in<br>
 reality from Assos <b><i>(the fourth from Troas)</i></b>, in contrast with \t&#275;i<br>
 epious&#275;i\ just before for Chios. <B>{We touched at Samos}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\parebalomen eis Samon\)</i></b>. Second aorist active of \paraball&#333;\,<br>
 to throw alongside, to cross over, to put in by. So Thucydides<br>
 III. 32. Only here in the N.T. though in Textus Receptus in <!-#-->Mr<br>
 4:30. The word parable <b><i>(\parabol&#275;\)</i></b> is from this verb. The<br>
 Textus Receptus adds here \kai meinantes en Trogulli&#333;i\ <b><i>(and<br>
 remaining at Trogyllium)</i></b>, but clearly not genuine. In passing<br>
 from Chios to Samos they sailed past Ephesus to save time for<br>
 Pentecost in Jerusalem <b><i>(verse <!-#-->16)</i></b>, if in control of the ship,<br>
 or because the captain allowed Paul to have his way. The island<br>
 of Samos is still further down the coast below Chios. It is not<br>
 stated whether a stop was made here or not. <B>{The day after}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i<br>
 echomen&#275;i\)</i></b>. The day holding itself next to the one before. Note<br>
 Luke's three terms in this verse <b><i>(\t&#275;i epious&#275;i, t&#275;i heter&#257;i, t&#275;i<br>
 echomen&#275;i\)</i></b>. This would be the fourth from Assos. <B>{To Miletus}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eis Mil&#275;ton\)</i></b>. About 28 miles south of Ephesus and now the site<br>
 is several miles from the sea due to the silt from the Maeander.<br>
 This city, once the chief city of the Ionian Greeks, was now<br>
 quite eclipsed by Ephesus.<br>
 <br>
 20:16 <B>{For Paul had determined}</B> <b><i>(\kekrikei gar ho Paulos\)</i></b>. Past<br>
 perfect active <b><i>(correct text)</i></b> of \krin&#333;\ and not the aorist<br>
 \ekrine\. Either Paul controlled the ship or the captain was<br>
 willing to oblige him. <B>{To sail past Ephesus}</B> <b><i>(\parapleusai t&#275;n<br>
 Epheson\)</i></b>. First aorist active infinitive of \paraple&#333;\, old verb<br>
 to sail beside, only here in the N.T. <B>{That he might not have}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hop&#333;s m&#275; gen&#275;tai aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Final clause <b><i>(negative)</i></b> with aorist<br>
 middle subjunctive of \ginomai\ and dative "that it might not<br>
 happen to him." <B>{To spend time}</B> <b><i>(\chronotrib&#275;sai\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active of the late compound verb \chronotribe&#333;\ <b><i>(\chronos\, time,<br>
 \trib&#333;\, to spend)</i></b>, only here in the N.T. The verb \trib&#333;\, to<br>
 rub, to wear out by rubbing, lends itself to the idea of wasting<br>
 time. It was only a year ago that Paul had left Ephesus in haste<br>
 after the riot. It was not expedient to go back so soon if he<br>
 meant to reach Jerusalem by Pentecost. Paul clearly felt <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro<br>
 15)</i></b> that the presentation of this collection at Pentecost to the<br>
 Jewish Christians would have a wholesome influence as it had done<br>
 once before <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:30)</i></b>. <B>{He was hastening}</B> <b><i>(\espeuden\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active of \speud&#333;\, old verb to hasten as in <!-#-->Lu 2:16;<br>
 19:56. <B>{If it were possible for him}</B> <b><i>(\ei dunaton ei&#275; aut&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Condition of the fourth class <b><i>(optative mode)</i></b>, if it should be<br>
 possible for him. The form is a remote possibility. It was only<br>
 some thirty days till Pentecost. <B>{The day of Pentecost}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n<br>
 h&#275;meran t&#275;s pent&#275;kost&#275;s\)</i></b>. Note the accusative case. Paul wanted<br>
 to be there for the whole day. See <!-#-->Ac 2:1 for this very phrase.<br>
 <br>
 20:17 <B>{Called to him}</B> <b><i>(\metekalesato\)</i></b>. Aorist middle <b><i>(indirect)</i></b><br>
 indicative of \metakale&#333;\, old verb to call from one place to<br>
 another <b><i>(\meta\ for "change")</i></b>, middle to call to oneself, only in<br>
 Acts in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->7:14; 10:32; 20:17; 24:25)</i></b>. Ephesus was some<br>
 thirty miles, a stiff day's journey each way. They would be with<br>
 Paul the third day of the stay in Miletus. <B>{The elders of the<br>
 church}</B> <b><i>(\tous presbuterous t&#275;s ekkl&#275;sias\)</i></b>. The very men whom<br>
 Paul terms "bishops" <b><i>(\episkopous\)</i></b> in verse <!-#-->28 just as in <!-#-->Tit<br>
 1:5,7 where both terms <b><i>(\presbuterous, ton episkopon\)</i></b> describe<br>
 the same office. The term "elder" applied to Christian ministers<br>
 first appears in <!-#-->Ac 11:30 in Jerusalem and reappears in<br>
 <!-#-->15:4,6,22 in connection with the apostles and the church. The<br>
 "elders" are not "apostles" but are "bishops" <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Php 1:1)</i></b> and<br>
 with "deacons" constitute the two classes of officers in the<br>
 early churches. Ignatius shows that in the early second century<br>
 the office of bishop over the elders had developed, but Lightfoot<br>
 has shown that it was not so in the first century. Each church,<br>
 as in Jerusalem, Philippi, Ephesus, had a number of "elders"<br>
 <b><i>("bishops")</i></b> in the one great city church. Hackett thinks that<br>
 other ministers from the neighbourhood also came. It was a noble<br>
 group of preachers and Paul, the greatest preacher of the ages,<br>
 makes a remarkable talk to preachers with all the earmarks of<br>
 Pauline originality <b><i>(Spitta, _Apostelgeschichte_, p. 252)</i></b> as<br>
 shown by the characteristic Pauline words, phrases, ideas current<br>
 in all his Epistles including the Pastoral <b><i>(testify, course,<br>
 pure, take heed, presbyter, bishop, acquire, apparel)</i></b>. Luke heard<br>
 this address as he may and probably did hear those in Jerusalem<br>
 and Caesarea <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 21-26)</i></b>. Furneaux suggests that Luke probably<br>
 took shorthand notes of the address since Galen says that his<br>
 students took down his medical lectures in shorthand: "At any<br>
 rate, of all the speeches in the Acts this contains most of Paul<br>
 and least of Luke. ... It reveals Paul as nothing else does. The<br>
 man who spoke it is no longer a man of eighteen centuries ago: he<br>
 is of yesterday; of today. He speaks as we speak and feels as we<br>
 feel; or rather as we fain would speak and feel." We have seen<br>
 and listened to Paul speak to the Jews in Antioch in Pisidia as<br>
 Luke pictures the scene, to the uneducated pagans at Lystra, to<br>
 the cultured Greeks in Athens. We shall hear him plead for his<br>
 life to the Jewish mob in Jerusalem, to the Roman governor Felix<br>
 in Caesarea, to the Jewish "King" Herod Agrippa II in Caesarea,<br>
 and at last to the Jews in Rome. But here Paul unbosoms himself<br>
 to the ministers of the church in Ephesus where he had spent<br>
 three years <b><i>(longer than with any other church)</i></b> and where he had<br>
 such varied experiences of prowess and persecution. He opens his<br>
 heart to these men as he does not to the average crowd even of<br>
 believers. It is Paul's _Apologia pro sua Vita_. He will probably<br>
 not see them again and so the outlook and attitude is similar to<br>
 the farewell discourse of Jesus to the disciples in the upper<br>
 room <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 13-17)</i></b>. He warns them about future perils as Jesus<br>
 had done. Paul's words here will repay any preacher's study<br>
 today. There is the same high conception of the ministry here<br>
 that Paul had already elaborated in <!-#-->2Co 2:12-6:10 <b><i>(see my<br>
 _Glory of the Ministry_)</i></b>. It is a fitting time and occasion for<br>
 Paul to take stock of his ministry at the close of the third<br>
 mission tour. What wonders had God wrought already.<br>
 <br>
 20:18 <B>{Ye yourselves know}</B> <b><i>(\humeis epistasthe\)</i></b>. Pronoun<br>
 expressed and emphatic. He appeals to their personal knowledge of<br>
 his life in Ephesus. <B>{From the first day that}</B> <b><i>(\apo pr&#333;t&#275;s<br>
 h&#275;meras aph' h&#275;s\)</i></b>. "From first day from which." He had first<br>
 "set foot" <b><i>(\epeb&#275;n\, second aorist active indicative of old verb<br>
 \epibain&#333;\, to step upon or step into)</i></b> in Ephesus four years ago<br>
 in the spring of 51 or 52, but had returned from Antioch that<br>
 autumn. It is now spring of 54 or 55 so that his actual ministry<br>
 in Ephesus was about two and a half years, roughly three years<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->31)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{After what manner I was with you}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;s meth' h&#8211;m&#333;n egenom&#275;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "How I came <b><i>(from Asia and so was)</i></b> with you." Cf. <!-#-->1Th<br>
 1:5; 2Th 2:1-10 where Paul likewise dares to refer boldly to his<br>
 life while with them "all the time" <b><i>(\ton panta chronon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Accusative of duration of time. So far as we know, Paul stuck to<br>
 Ephesus the whole period. He had devoted himself consecratedly to<br>
 the task in Ephesus. Each pastor is bishop of his field and has a<br>
 golden opportunity to work it for Christ. One of the saddest<br>
 things about the present situation is the restlessness of<br>
 preachers to go elsewhere instead of devoting themselves wholly<br>
 to the task where they are. <!-#-->19. <B>{Serving the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\douleu&#333;n<br>
 t&#333;i kuri&#333;i\)</i></b>. It was Paul's glory to be the \doulos\ <b><i>(bond-slave)</i></b><br>
 as in <!-#-->Ro 1:1; Php 1:1. Paul alone, save Jesus in <!-#-->Mt 6:24; Lu<br>
 16:13, uses \douleu&#333;\ six times for serving God <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. <B>{With<br>
 all lowliness of mind}</B> <b><i>(\meta pas&#275;s tapeinophrosun&#275;s\)</i></b>. Lightfoot<br>
 notes that heathen writers use this word for a grovelling, abject<br>
 state of mind, but Paul follows Christ in using it for humility,<br>
 humble-mindedness that should mark every Christian and in<br>
 particular the preacher. <B>{With tears}</B> <b><i>(\dakru&#333;n\)</i></b>. Construed with<br>
 \meta\. Paul was a man of the deepest emotion along with his high<br>
 intellectuality. He mentions his tears again in verse <!-#-->31, tears<br>
 of sorrow and of anxiety. He refers to his tears in writing the<br>
 sharp letter to the church in Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 2:4)</i></b> and in<br>
 denouncing the sensual apostates in <!-#-->Php 3:18. Adolphe Monod has<br>
 a wonderful sermon on the tears of Paul. Consider also the tears<br>
 of Jesus. <B>{Trials which befell me}</B> <b><i>(\peirasm&#333;n t&#333;n sumbant&#333;n<br>
 moi\)</i></b>. Construed also with \meta\. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \sunbain&#333;\, to walk with, to go with, to come<br>
 together, to happen, to befall. Very common in this sense in the<br>
 old Greek <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ac 3:10)</i></b>. <B>{By the plots of the Jews}</B> <b><i>(\en tais<br>
 epiboulais t&#333;n Ioudai&#333;n\)</i></b>. Like the plot <b><i>(\epiboul&#275;\)</i></b> against him<br>
 in Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->20:3)</i></b> as well as the earlier trial before Gallio<br>
 and the attacks in Thessalonica. In <!-#-->Ac 19:9 Luke shows the<br>
 hostile attitude of the Jews in Ephesus that drove Paul out of<br>
 the synagogue to the school of Tyrannus. He does not describe in<br>
 detail these "plots" which may easily be imagined from Paul's own<br>
 letters and may be even referred to in <!-#-->1Co 4:10; 15:30ff.; 16:9;<br>
 2Co 1:4-10; 7:5; 11:23. In fact, one has only to dwell on the<br>
 allusions in <!-#-->2Co 11 to picture what Paul's life was in Ephesus<br>
 during these three years. Luke gives in <!-#-->Ac 19 the outbreak of<br>
 Demetrius, but Paul had already fought with "wild-beasts" there.<br>
 <br>
 20:20 <B>{How that I shrank not}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s ouden hupesteilamen\)</i></b>. Still<br>
 indirect discourse <b><i>(question)</i></b> after \epistasthe\ <b><i>(ye know)</i></b> with<br>
 \h&#333;s\ like \p&#333;s\ in verse <!-#-->18. First aorist middle of<br>
 \hupostell&#333;\, old verb to draw under or back. It was so used of<br>
 drawing back or down sails on a ship and, as Paul had so recently<br>
 been on the sea, that may be the metaphor here. But it is not<br>
 necessarily so as the direct middle here makes good sense and is<br>
 frequent, to withdraw oneself, to cower, to shrink, to conceal,<br>
 to dissemble as in <!-#-->Hab 2:4 <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 10:38)</i></b>. Demosthenes so used<br>
 it to shrink from declaring out of fear for others. This open<br>
 candour of Paul is supported by his Epistles <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 2:4,11; 2Co<br>
 4:2; Ga 1:10)</i></b>. <B>{From declaring unto you}</B> <b><i>(\tou m&#275; anaggeilai<br>
 humin\)</i></b>. Ablative case of the articular first aorist active<br>
 infinitive of \anaggell&#333;\ with the redundant negative after verbs<br>
 of hindering, etc. <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1094)</i></b>. <B>{Anything<br>
 that was profitable}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n sumpheront&#333;n\)</i></b>. Partitive genitive<br>
 after \ouden\ of the articular present active participle of<br>
 \sumpher&#333;\, to bear together, be profitable. <B>{Publicly}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\d&#275;mosi&#257;i\, adverb)</i></b> <B>{and from house to house}</B> <b><i>(\kai kat'<br>
 oikous\)</i></b>. By <b><i>(according to)</i></b> houses. It is worth noting that this<br>
 greatest of preachers preached from house to house and did not<br>
 make his visits merely social calls. He was doing kingdom<br>
 business all the while as in the house of Aquila and Priscilla<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 16:19)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 20:21 <B>{Testifying}</B> <b><i>(\diamarturomenos\)</i></b>. As Peter did <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 2:40)</i></b><br>
 where Luke uses this same word thoroughly Lucan and Pauline. So<br>
 again in verses <!-#-->23,24. Paul here as in <!-#-->Ro 1:16 includes both<br>
 Jews and Greeks, to the Jew first. <B>{Repentance toward God}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n<br>
 eis theon metanoian\)</i></b> <B>{and faith toward our Lord Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 pistin eis ton kurion h&#275;m&#333;n I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. These two elements run<br>
 through the Epistle to the Romans which Paul had recently written<br>
 and sent from Corinth. These two elements appear in all Paul's<br>
 preaching whether "to Jews or Gentiles, to philosophers at Athens<br>
 or to peasants at Lystra, he preached repentance toward God and<br>
 faith toward the Lord Jesus" <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 20:22 <B>{Bound in the spirit}</B> <b><i>(\dedemenos t&#333;i pneumati\)</i></b>. Perfect<br>
 passive participle of \de&#333;\, to bind, with the locative case.<br>
 "Bound in my spirit" he means, as in <!-#-->19:21, from a high sense<br>
 of duty. The mention of "the Holy Spirit" specifically in verse<br>
 <!-#-->23 seems to be in contrast to his own spirit here. His own<br>
 spirit was under the control of the Holy Spirit <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 8:16)</i></b> and<br>
 the sense does not differ greatly. <B>{Not knowing}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; eid&#333;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second perfect active participle of \oida\ with \m&#275;\. <B>{That shall<br>
 befall me}</B> <b><i>(\ta sunant&#275;sonta emoi\)</i></b>. Articular future active<br>
 participle of \sunanta&#333;\, to meet with <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10:25)</i></b>, to befall<br>
 <b><i>(with associative instrumental case)</i></b> and compare with \sumbant&#333;n\<br>
 <b><i>(befell)</i></b> in verse <!-#-->19. One of the rare instances of the future<br>
 participle in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 20:23 <B>{Save that}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;n hoti\)</i></b>. The \hoti\ clause is really in<br>
 the ablative case after \pl&#275;n\, here a preposition as in <!-#-->Php<br>
 1:18, this idiom \pl&#275;n hoti\ occasionally in ancient Greek. <B>{In<br>
 every city}</B> <b><i>(\kata polin\)</i></b>. Singular here though plural in \kat'<br>
 oikous\ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->20)</i></b>. <B>{Bonds and afflictions}</B> <b><i>(\desma kai<br>
 thlipseis\)</i></b>. Both together as in <!-#-->Php 1:17; 2Co 1:8. Literal<br>
 bonds and actual pressures. <B>{Abide me}</B> <b><i>(\me menousin\)</i></b>. With the<br>
 accusative as in verse <!-#-->5 <b><i>(\emenon h&#275;mas\)</i></b> and nowhere else in<br>
 the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 20:24 <B>{But I hold not my life of any account}</B> <b><i>(\all' oudenos<br>
 logou poioumai t&#275;n psuch&#275;n\)</i></b>. Neat Greek idiom, accusative<br>
 \psuch&#275;n\ and genitive \logou\ and then Paul adds "dear unto<br>
 myself" <b><i>(\timian emaut&#333;i\)</i></b> in apposition with \psuch&#275;n\ <b><i>(really a<br>
 combination of two constructions)</i></b>. <B>{So that I may accomplish my<br>
 course}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s telei&#333;s&#333; dromon mou\)</i></b>. Rather, "In order that"<br>
 <b><i>(purpose, not result)</i></b>. Aleph and B read \telei&#333;s&#333;\ here <b><i>(first<br>
 aorist active subjunctive)</i></b> rather than \telei&#333;sai\ <b><i>(first aorist<br>
 active infinitive)</i></b>. It is the lone instance in the N.T. of \h&#333;s\<br>
 as a final particle <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 987)</i></b>. Paul in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 13:25 in his sermon at Antioch in Pisidia described John as<br>
 fulfilling his course and in <!-#-->2Ti 4:7 he will say: "I have<br>
 finished my course" <b><i>(\ton dromon teteleka\)</i></b>. He will run the race<br>
 to the end. <B>{Which I received from the Lord Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;n elabon<br>
 para tou kuriou I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. Of that fact he never had a doubt and it<br>
 was a proud boast <b><i>(<!-#-->Gal 1:1; Ro 11:13)</i></b>. <B>{The gospel of the grace<br>
 of God}</B> <b><i>(\to euaggelion t&#275;s charitos tou theou\)</i></b>. To Paul the<br>
 gospel consisted in the grace of God. See this word "grace"<br>
 <b><i>(\charis\)</i></b> in Romans and his other Epistles.<br>
 <br>
 20:25 <B>{And now, behold}</B> <b><i>(\kai nun, idou\)</i></b>. Second time and solemn<br>
 reminder as in verse <!-#-->22. <B>{I know}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; oida\)</i></b>. Emphasis on<br>
 \eg&#333;\ which is expressed. <B>{Ye all}</B> <b><i>(\humeis pantes\)</i></b>. In very<br>
 emphatic position after the verb \opsesthe\ <b><i>(shall see)</i></b> and the<br>
 object <b><i>(my face)</i></b>. Twice Paul will write from Rome <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 2:24; Phm<br>
 1:22)</i></b> the hope of coming east again; but that is in the future,<br>
 and here Paul is expressing his personal conviction and his<br>
 fears. The Pastoral Epistles show Paul did come to Ephesus again<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 1:3; 3:14; 4:13)</i></b> and Troas <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 4:13)</i></b> and Miletus <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti<br>
 4:20)</i></b>. There need be no surprise that Paul's fears turned out<br>
 otherwise. He had reason enough for them. <B>{Among whom I went<br>
 about}</B> <b><i>(\en hois di&#275;lthon\)</i></b>. Apparently Paul here has in mind<br>
 others beside the ministers. They represented the church in<br>
 Ephesus and the whole region where Paul laboured.<br>
 <br>
 20:26 <B>{I testify}</B> <b><i>(\marturomai\)</i></b>. Elsewhere in the N.T. only in<br>
 Paul's Epistles <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 5:3; Eph 4:17; 1Th 2:12)</i></b>. It means "I call<br>
 to witness" while \marture&#333;\ means "I bear witness." <B>{This day}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\en t&#275;i s&#275;meron h&#275;mer&#257;i\)</i></b>. The today day, the last day with you,<br>
 our parting day. <B>{I am pure from the blood of all men}</B> <b><i>(\katharos<br>
 eimi apo tou haimatos pant&#333;n\)</i></b>. Paul was sensitive on this point<br>
 as in Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:6)</i></b>. It is much for any preacher to claim<br>
 and it ought to be true of all. The papyri also give this use of<br>
 \apo\ with the ablative rather than the mere ablative after<br>
 \katharos\.<br>
 <br>
 20:27 Paul here repeats the very words and idioms used in verse<br>
 <!-#-->20, adding "the whole counsel of God" <b><i>(\p&#257;san t&#275;n boul&#275;n tou<br>
 theou\)</i></b>. All the counsel of God that concerned Paul's work and<br>
 nothing inconsistent with the purpose of God of redemption<br>
 through Christ Jesus <b><i>(Page)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 20:28 <B>{Take heed unto yourselves}</B> <b><i>(\prosechete heautois\)</i></b>. The<br>
 full phrase had \ton noun\, hold your mind on yourselves <b><i>(or<br>
 other object in the dative)</i></b>, as often in old writers and in <!-#-->Job<br>
 7:17. But the ancients often used the idiom with \noun\<br>
 understood, but not expressed as here and <!-#-->Ac 5:35; Lu 12:1;<br>
 17:3; 21:34; 1Ti 1:4; 3:8; 4:13. \Epeche\ is so used in <!-#-->1Ti<br>
 4:16. <B>{To all the flock}</B> <b><i>(\panti t&#333;i poimni&#333;i\)</i></b>. Contracted form<br>
 of \poimenion = poimn&#275;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 10:16)</i></b> already in <!-#-->Lu 12:32 and<br>
 also in <!-#-->Ac 20:29; 1Pe 5:2,3. Common in old Greek. <B>{Hath made}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\etheto\)</i></b>. Did make, second aorist middle indicative of<br>
 \tith&#275;mi\, did appoint. Paul evidently believed that the Holy<br>
 Spirit calls and appoints ministers. <B>{Bishops}</B> <b><i>(\episkopous\)</i></b>.<br>
 The same men termed elders in verse <!-#-->17 which see. <B>{To shepherd}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\poimainein\)</i></b>. Present active infinitive of purpose of<br>
 \poimain&#333;\, old verb to feed or tend the flock <b><i>(\poimn&#275;,<br>
 poimnion\)</i></b>, to act as shepherd <b><i>(\poim&#275;n\)</i></b>. These ministers are<br>
 thus in Paul's speech called elders <b><i>(verse <!-#-->17)</i></b>, bishops <b><i>(verse<br>
 <!-#-->28)</i></b>, and shepherds <b><i>(verse <!-#-->28)</i></b>. Jesus had used this very word<br>
 to Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 21:16, twice \boske\, feed, <!-#-->21:15,17)</i></b> and Peter<br>
 will use it in addressing fellow-elders <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 5:2)</i></b> with<br>
 memories, no doubt of the words of Jesus to him. The "elders"<br>
 were to watch over as "bishops" and "tend and feed as shepherds"<br>
 the flock. Jesus is termed "the shepherd and bishop of your<br>
 souls" in <!-#-->1Pe 2:25 and "the great Shepherd of the sheep" in<br>
 <!-#-->Heb 13:20. Jesus called himself "the good Shepherd" in <!-#-->Joh<br>
 10:11. <B>{The church of God}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n ekkl&#275;sian tou theou\)</i></b>. The<br>
 correct text, not "the church of the Lord" or "the church of the<br>
 Lord and God" <b><i>(Robertson, _Introduction to Textual Criticism of<br>
 the N.T._, p. 189)</i></b>. <B>{He purchased}</B> <b><i>(\periepoi&#275;sato\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist middle of \peripoie&#333;\, old verb to reserve, to preserve<br>
 <b><i>(for or by oneself, in the middle)</i></b>. In the N.T. only in Luke<br>
 <!-#-->17:33; Ac 20:28; 1Ti 3:13. The substantive \peripoi&#275;sin\<br>
 <b><i>(preservation, possession)</i></b> occurs in <!-#-->1Pe 2:9 <b><i>("a peculiar<br>
 people" = a people for a possession)</i></b> and in <!-#-->Eph 1:14. <B>{With his<br>
 own blood}</B> <b><i>(\dia tou haimatos tou idiou\)</i></b>. Through the agency of<br>
 <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> his own blood. Whose blood? If \tou theou\ <b><i>(Aleph B<br>
 Vulg.)</i></b> is correct, as it is, then Jesus is here called "God" who<br>
 shed his own blood for the flock. It will not do to say that Paul<br>
 did not call Jesus God, for we have <!-#-->Ro 9:5; Col 2:9; Tit 2:13<br>
 where he does that very thing, besides <!-#-->Col 1:15-20; Php 2:5-11.<br>
 <br>
 20:29 <B>{After my departing}</B> <b><i>(\meta t&#275;n aphixin mou\)</i></b>. Not his<br>
 death, but his departure from them. From \aphikneomai\ and<br>
 usually meant arrival, but departure in Herodotus IX. 17, 76 as<br>
 here. <B>{Grievous wolves}</B> <b><i>(\lukoi bareis\)</i></b>. \Bareis\ is heavy,<br>
 rapacious, harsh. Jesus had already so described false teachers<br>
 who would raven the fold <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 10:12)</i></b>. Whether Paul had in mind<br>
 the Judaizers who had given him so much trouble in Antioch,<br>
 Jerusalem, Galatia, Corinth or the Gnostics the shadow of whose<br>
 coming he already foresaw is not perfectly clear. But it will not<br>
 be many years before Epaphras will come to Rome from Colossae<br>
 with news of the new peril there <b><i>(Epistle to the Colossians)</i></b>. In<br>
 writing to Timothy <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 1:20)</i></b> Paul will warn him against some<br>
 who have already made shipwreck of their faith. In <!-#-->Re 2:2 John<br>
 will represent Jesus as describing false apostles in Ephesus.<br>
 <B>{Not sparing the flock}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; pheidomenoi tou poimniou\)</i></b>. Litotes<br>
 again as so often in Acts. Sparing the flock was not the fashion<br>
 of wolves. Jesus sent the seventy as lambs in the midst of wolves<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 10:3)</i></b>. In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus had pictured the<br>
 false prophets who would come as ravening wolves in sheep's<br>
 clothing <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 7:15)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 20:30 <B>{From among your own selves}</B> <b><i>(\ex hum&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. In sheep's<br>
 clothing just as Jesus had foretold. The outcome fully justified<br>
 Paul's apprehensions as we see in Colossians, Ephesians, I and II<br>
 Timothy, Revelation. False philosophy, immorality, asceticism<br>
 will lead some astray <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 2:8,18; Eph 4:14; 5:6)</i></b>. John will<br>
 picture "antichrists" who went out from us because they were not<br>
 of us <b><i>(<!-#-->1Jo 2:18f.)</i></b>. There is a false optimism that is<br>
 complacently blind as well as a despondent pessimism that gives<br>
 up the fight. <B>{Perverse things}</B> <b><i>(\diestrammena\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle of \diastreph&#333;\, old verb to turn aside, twist,<br>
 distort as in <!-#-->Ac 13:8,10. <B>{To draw away}</B> <b><i>(\tou aposp&#257;in\)</i></b>.<br>
 Articular genitive present active participle of purpose from<br>
 \apospa&#333;\, old verb used to draw the sword <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 26:51)</i></b>, to<br>
 separate <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:41; Ac 21:1)</i></b>. The pity of it is that such<br>
 leaders of dissension can always gain a certain following. Paul's<br>
 long residence in Ephesus enabled him to judge clearly of<br>
 conditions there.<br>
 <br>
 20:31 <B>{Wherefore watch ye}</B> <b><i>(\dio gr&#275;goreite\)</i></b>. Paul has concluded<br>
 his defence of himself and his warning. Now he exhorts on the<br>
 basis of it <b><i>(\dio\)</i></b> because of which thing. The very command of<br>
 Jesus concerning the perils before his return as in <!-#-->Mr 13:35<br>
 <b><i>(\gr&#275;goreite\)</i></b>, the very form <b><i>(late present imperative from the<br>
 second perfect \egr&#275;gora\ of \egeir&#333;\, to arouse)</i></b>. Stay awake. <B>{I<br>
 ceased not to admonish}</B> <b><i>(\ouk epausam&#275;n nouthet&#333;n\)</i></b>. Participle<br>
 describes Paul, I did not cease admonishing, night and day<br>
 <b><i>(\nukta kai h&#275;meran\, accusative of extent of time, for three<br>
 years \trietian\, accusative of extent of time also)</i></b>. \Nouthet&#333;n\<br>
 is from \nouthete&#333;\, to put sense into one. So Paul kept it up<br>
 with tears <b><i>(verse <!-#-->19)</i></b> if so be he could save the Ephesians from<br>
 the impending perils. Forewarned is to be forearmed. Paul did his<br>
 duty by them.<br>
 <br>
 20:32 <B>{And now}</B> <b><i>(\kai ta nun\)</i></b>. Same phrase as in verses <!-#-->22,25<br>
 save that \idou\ <b><i>(behold)</i></b> is wanting and the article \ta\ occurs<br>
 before \nun\, accusative of general reference. And as to the<br>
 present things <b><i>(or situation)</i></b> as in <!-#-->4:29. <B>{I commend}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\paratithemai\)</i></b>. Present middle indicative of \paratith&#275;mi\, old<br>
 verb to place beside, middle, to deposit with one, to interest as<br>
 in <!-#-->1Ti 1:18; 2Ti 2:2. Paul can now only do this, but he does it<br>
 hopefully. Cf. <!-#-->1Pe 4:19. <B>{The word of his grace}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i log&#333;i<br>
 t&#275;s charitos autou\)</i></b>. The instrumentality through preaching and<br>
 the Holy Spirit employed by God. Cf. <!-#-->Col 4:6; Eph 4:29. <B>{Which<br>
 is able to build up}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i dunamen&#333;i oikodom&#275;sai\)</i></b>. God works<br>
 through the word of his grace and so it is able to build up<br>
 <b><i>(edify)</i></b>; a favourite Pauline word <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 3:10-14; 3:9; 2Co 5:1;<br>
 Eph 2:20-22; 2Ti 3:15; etc.)</i></b>, and <!-#-->Jas 1:21. The very words<br>
 "build" and "inheritance among the sanctified" will occur in <!-#-->Eph<br>
 1:11; 2:30; 3:18 and which some may recall on reading. Cf. <!-#-->Col<br>
 1:12. Stephen in <!-#-->Ac 7:5 used the word "inheritance"<br>
 <b><i>(\kl&#275;ronomian\)</i></b>, nowhere else in Acts, but in <!-#-->Eph 1:14,18; 5:5.<br>
 In <!-#-->Eph 1:18 the very expression occurs "his inheritance among<br>
 the saints " <b><i>(\t&#275;n kl&#275;ronomian autou en tois hagiois\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 20:33 <B>{No man's silver or gold or apparel}</B> <b><i>(\arguriou &#275; chrusiou<br>
 &#275; himatismou oudenos\)</i></b>. Genitive case after \epethum&#275;sa\. One of<br>
 the slanders against Paul was that he was raising this<br>
 collection, ostensibly for the poor, really for himself <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co<br>
 12:17f.)</i></b>. He includes "apparel" because oriental wealth<br>
 consisted largely in fine apparel <b><i>(not old worn out clothes)</i></b>. See<br>
 <!-#-->Ge 24:53; 2Ki 5:5; Ps 45:13f.; Mt 6:19. Paul did not preach<br>
 just for money.<br>
 <br>
 20:34 <B>{Ye yourselves}</B> <b><i>(\autoi\)</i></b>. Intensive pronoun. Certainly<br>
 they knew that the church in Ephesus had not supported Paul while<br>
 there. <B>{These hands}</B> <b><i>(\hai cheires hautai\)</i></b>. Paul was not above<br>
 manual labour. He pointed to his hands with pride as proof that<br>
 he toiled at his trade of tent-making as at Thessalonica and<br>
 Corinth for his own needs <b><i>(\chreiais\)</i></b> and for those with him<br>
 <b><i>(probably Aquila and Priscilla)</i></b> with whom he lived and probably<br>
 Timothy because of his often infirmities <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 5:23)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Ministered}</B> <b><i>(\hup&#275;ret&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist active of \hup&#275;rete&#333;\,<br>
 to act as under rower, old verb, but in the N.T. only in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 13:36; 20:34; 24:23. While in Ephesus Paul wrote to Corinth: "We<br>
 toil, working with our own hands" <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 4:12)</i></b>. "As he held them<br>
 up, they saw a tongue of truth in every seam that marked them"<br>
 <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 20:35 <B>{I gave you an example}</B> <b><i>(\hupedeixa\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of \hupodeiknumi\, old verb to show under one's eyes,<br>
 to give object lesson, by deed as well as by word <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:47)</i></b>.<br>
 \Hupodeigma\ means example <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 13:15; Jas 5:10)</i></b>. So Paul<br>
 appeals to his example in <!-#-->1Co 11:1; Php 3:17. \Panta\ is<br>
 accusative plural of general reference <b><i>(in all things)</i></b>. <B>{So<br>
 labouring ye ought to help}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s kopi&#333;ntas dei<br>
 antilambanesthai\)</i></b>. So, as I did. Necessity <b><i>(\dei\)</i></b>. Toiling<br>
 <b><i>(\kopi&#333;ntas\)</i></b> not just for ourselves, but to help<br>
 <b><i>(\antilambanesthai\)</i></b>, to take hold yourselves <b><i>(middle voice)</i></b> at<br>
 the other end <b><i>(\anti\)</i></b>. This verb common in the old Greek, but in<br>
 the N.T. only in <!-#-->Lu 1:54; Ac 20:35; 1Ti 6:2. This noble plea to<br>
 help the weak is the very spirit of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 5:14; 1Co 12:28;<br>
 Ro 5:6; 14:1)</i></b>. In <!-#-->1Th 5:14 \antechesthe t&#333;n asthenount&#333;n\ we<br>
 have Paul's very idea again. Every Community Chest appeal today<br>
 re-echoes Paul's plea. <B>{He himself said}</B> <b><i>(\autos eipen\)</i></b>. Not in<br>
 the Gospels, one of the sayings of Jesus in current use that Paul<br>
 had received and treasured. Various other _Agrapha_ of Jesus have<br>
 been preserved in ancient writers and some in recently discovered<br>
 papyri which may be genuine or not. We are grateful that Paul<br>
 treasured this one. This Beatitude <b><i>(on \makarion\ see on <!-#-->Mt<br>
 5:3-11)</i></b> is illustrated by the whole life of Jesus with the Cross<br>
 as the culmination. Aristotle <b><i>(Eth. IV. I)</i></b> has a saying somewhat<br>
 like this, but assigns the feeling of superiority as the reason<br>
 <b><i>(Page)</i></b>, an utterly different idea from that here. This quotation<br>
 raises the question of how much Paul personally knew of the life<br>
 and sayings of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 20:36 <B>{He kneeled down}</B> <b><i>(\theis ta gonata autou\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active participle of \tith&#275;mi\, to place. The very idiom used in<br>
 <!-#-->7:60 of Stephen. Not in ancient writers and only six times in<br>
 the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 15:19; Lu 22:41; Ac 7:60; 9:40; 20:36; 21:5)</i></b>.<br>
 Certainly kneeling in prayer is a fitting attitude <b><i>(cf. Jesus,<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 22:41)</i></b>, though not the only proper one <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 6:5)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 apparently prayed aloud <b><i>(\pros&#275;uxato\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 20:37 <B>{They all wept sore}</B> <b><i>(\hikanos klauthmos egeneto pant&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, There came considerable weeping of all <b><i>(on the part of<br>
 all, genitive case)</i></b>. <B>{Kissed him}</B> <b><i>(\katephiloun auton\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active of \kataphile&#333;\, old verb, intensive with \kata\<br>
 and repetition shown also by the tense: They kept on kissing or<br>
 kissed repeatedly, probably one after the other falling on his<br>
 neck. Cf. also <!-#-->Mt 26:49.<br>
 <br>
 20:38 <B>{Sorrowing}</B> <b><i>(\odun&#333;menoi\)</i></b>. Present middle participle of<br>
 \oduna&#333;\, old verb to cause intense pain, to torment <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 16:24)</i></b>, middle to distress oneself <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:48; Ac 20:38)</i></b>.<br>
 Nowhere else in N.T. <B>{Which he had spoken}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;i eir&#275;kei\)</i></b>.<br>
 Relative attracted to the case of the antecedent \log&#333;i\ <b><i>(word)</i></b>.<br>
 Past perfect indicative of \eipon\. <B>{They brought him on his way}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\proepempon auton\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \propemp&#333;\, old verb to<br>
 send forward, to accompany as in <!-#-->Ac 15:3; 20:38; 21:5; 1Co<br>
 16:6,11; 2Co 1:16; Tit 3:13; 3Jo 1:6. Graphic picture of Paul's<br>
 departure from this group of ministers.<br>
