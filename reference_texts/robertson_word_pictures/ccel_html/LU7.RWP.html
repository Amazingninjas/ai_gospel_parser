<p>7:1 <B>{After}</B> <b><i>(\epeid&#275;, epei and d&#275;\)</i></b>. This conjunction was written<br>
 \epei d&#275;\ in Homer and is simple \epei\ with the intensive \d&#275;\<br>
 added and even \epei d&#275; per\ once in N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:1)</i></b>. This is the<br>
 only instance of the temporal use of \epeid&#275;\ in the N.T. The<br>
 causal sense occurs only in Luke and Paul, for \epei\ is the<br>
 correct text in <!-#-->Mt 21:46. <B>{Had ended}</B> <b><i>(\epl&#275;r&#333;sen\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active indicative. There is here a reference to the<br>
 conclusion of the Sermon on the Mount, but with nothing<br>
 concerning the impression produced by the discourse such as is<br>
 seen in <!-#-->Mt 7:28. This verse really belongs as the conclusion of<br>
 Chapter 6, not as the beginning of Chapter 7. <B>{In the ears of the<br>
 people}</B> <b><i>(\eis tas akoas tou laou\)</i></b>. \Ako&#275;\ from \akou&#333;\, to hear,<br>
 is used of the sense of hearing <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 12:17)</i></b>, the ear with which<br>
 one hears <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 7:35; Heb 5:11)</i></b>, the thing heard or the report<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Rom 10:16)</i></b> or oral instruction <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 3:2,5)</i></b>. Both <!-#-->Mt 8:5-13;<br>
 Lu 7:1-10 locate the healing of the centurion's servant in<br>
 Capernaum where Jesus was after the Sermon on the Mount.<br>
 <br>
 7:2 <B>{Centurion's servant}</B> <b><i>(\Hekatontarchou tinos doulos\)</i></b>. Slave<br>
 of a certain centurion <b><i>(Latin word \centurio\, commander of a<br>
 century or hundred)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr 15:39,44 has the Latin word in Greek<br>
 letters, \kenturi&#333;n\. The centurion commanded a company which<br>
 varied from fifty to a hundred. Each cohort had six centuries.<br>
 Each legion had ten cohorts or bands <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10:1)</i></b>. The centurions<br>
 mentioned in the N.T. all seem to be fine men as Polybius states<br>
 that the best men in the army had this position. See also <!-#-->Lu<br>
 23:47. The Greek has two forms of the word, both from \hekaton\,<br>
 hundred, and \arch&#333;\, to rule, and they appear to be used<br>
 interchangeably. So we have \hekatontarchos\; here, the form is<br>
 \-archos\, and \hekatontarch&#275;s\, the form is \-arch&#275;s\ in verse<br>
 <!-#-->6. The manuscripts differ about it in almost every instance.<br>
 The \-archos\ form is accepted by Westcott and Hort only in the<br>
 nominative save the genitive singular here in <!-#-->Lu 7:2 and the<br>
 accusative singular in <!-#-->Ac 22:25. See like variation between<br>
 them in <!-#-->Mt 8:5,8 <b><i>(\-archos\)</i></b> and <!-#-->Mt 8:13 <b><i>(\arch&#275;i\)</i></b>. So also<br>
 \-archon\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 22:25)</i></b> and \-arch&#275;s\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 22:26)</i></b>. <B>{Dear to him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aut&#333;i entimos\)</i></b>. Held in honour, prized, precious, dear <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 14:8; 1Pe 2:4; Php 2:29)</i></b>, common Greek word. Even though a slave<br>
 he was dear to him. <B>{Was sick}</B> <b><i>(\kak&#333;s ech&#333;n\)</i></b>. Having it bad.<br>
 Common idiom. See already <!-#-->Mt 4:24; 8:16; Mr 2:17; Lu 5:31, etc.<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 8:6 notes that the slave was a paralytic. <B>{And at the point<br>
 of death}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;mellen teleut&#257;in\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \mell&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(note double augment \&#275;\)</i></b> which is used either with the present<br>
 infinitive as here, the aorist <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 3:16)</i></b>, or even the future<br>
 because of the future idea in \mell&#333;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:28; 24:15)</i></b>. He was<br>
 about to die.<br>
 <br>
 7:3 <B>{Sent unto him elders of the Jews}</B> <b><i>(\apesteilen pros auton<br>
 presbouterous t&#333;n Ioudai&#333;n\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 8:5 says "the centurion came<br>
 unto him." For discussion of this famous case of apparent<br>
 discrepancy see discussion on Matthew. One possible solution is<br>
 that Luke tells the story as it happened with the details,<br>
 whereas Matthew simply presents a summary statement without the<br>
 details. What one does through another he does himself. <B>{Asking<br>
 him}</B> <b><i>(\er&#333;t&#333;n auton\)</i></b>. Present active participle, masculine<br>
 singular nominative, of the verb \er&#333;ta&#333;\ common for asking a<br>
 question as in the old Greek <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:68)</i></b>. But more frequently in<br>
 the N.T. the verb has the idea of making a request as here. This<br>
 is not a Hebraism or an Aramaism, but is a common meaning of the<br>
 verb in the papyri <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient East_, p.<br>
 168)</i></b>. It is to be noted here that Luke represents the centurion<br>
 himself as "asking" through the elders of the Jews <b><i>(leading<br>
 citizens)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Mt 8:6 the verb is \parakal&#333;n\ <b><i>(beseeching)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{That he would come and save}</B> <b><i>(\hop&#333;s elth&#333;n dias&#333;s&#275;i\)</i></b>. \Hina\<br>
 is the more common final or sub-final <b><i>(as here)</i></b> conjunction, but<br>
 \hop&#333;s\ still occurs. \Dias&#333;s&#275;i\ is effective aorist active<br>
 subjunctive, to bring safe through as in a storm <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 28:1,4)</i></b>.<br>
 Common word.<br>
 <br>
 7:4 <B>{Besought}</B> <b><i>(\parekaloun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, began and kept<br>
 on beseeching. This is the same verb used by Matthew in <!-#-->Mt 8:5<br>
 of the centurion himself. <B>{Earnestly}</B> <b><i>(\spoudai&#333;s\)</i></b>. From<br>
 \spoud&#275;\ haste. So eagerly, earnestly, zealously, for time was<br>
 short. <B>{That thou shouldst do this for him}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;i parex&#275;i<br>
 touto\)</i></b>. Second future middle singular of \parech&#333;\. Old and<br>
 common verb, furnish on thy part. \H&#333;i\ is relative in dative<br>
 case almost with notion of contemplated result <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 961)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:5 <B>{For}</B> <b><i>(\gar\)</i></b>. This clause gives the reason why the elders of<br>
 the Jews consider him "worthy" <b><i>(\axios\, drawing down the scale,<br>
 \axis\, \ago\)</i></b>. He was hardly a proselyte, but was a Roman who<br>
 had shown his love for the Jews. <B>{Himself}</B> <b><i>(\autos\)</i></b>. All by<br>
 himself and at his own expense. <B>{Us}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;min\)</i></b>. Dative case, for<br>
 us. It is held by some archaeologists that the black basalt ruins<br>
 in Tell Hum are the remains of the very synagogue <b><i>(\t&#275;n<br>
 sunag&#333;g&#275;n\)</i></b>. Literally, <B>{the synagogue}</B>, the one which we have,<br>
 the one for us.<br>
 <br>
 7:6 <B>{Went with them}</B> <b><i>(\eporeueto sun autois\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 indicative middle. He started to go along with them. <B>{Now}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;d&#275;\)</i></b>. Already like Latin _jam_. In <!-#-->1Co 4:8 \nun &#275;d&#275;\ like<br>
 _jam nunc_. <B>{Sent friends}</B> <b><i>(\epempsen philous\)</i></b>. This second<br>
 embassy also, wanting in Matthew's narrative. He "puts the<br>
 message of both into the mouth of the centurion himself"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. Note saying <b><i>(\leg&#333;n\)</i></b>, present active singular<br>
 participle, followed by direct quotation from the centurion<br>
 himself. <B>{Trouble not thyself}</B> <b><i>(\M&#275; skullou\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 <b><i>(direct use)</i></b> imperative of \skull&#333;\, old verb originally meaning<br>
 to skin, to mangle, and then in later Greek to vex, trouble,<br>
 annoy. Frequent in the papyri in this latter sense. <B>{For I am not<br>
 worthy that}</B> <b><i>(\ou gar hikanos eimi hina\)</i></b>. The same word<br>
 \hikanos\, not \axios\, as in <!-#-->Mt 8:8, which see for discussion,<br>
 from \hik&#333;, hikan&#333;\, to fit, to reach, be adequate for. \Hina\ in<br>
 both places as common in late Greek. See <!-#-->Mt 8:8 also for "roof"<br>
 <b><i>(\steg&#275;n\, covering)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:7 <B>{Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dio oude emauton &#275;xi&#333;sa pros se elthein\)</i></b>. Not in Matthew<br>
 because he represents the centurion as coming to Jesus. <B>{Speak<br>
 the word}</B> <b><i>(\eipe log&#333;i\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->Mt 8:8. Second aorist active<br>
 imperative with instrumental case, speak with a word. <B>{My servant<br>
 shall be healed}</B> <b><i>(\iath&#275;t&#333; ho pais mou\)</i></b>. Imperative first aorist<br>
 passive, let be healed. \Pais\ literally means "boy," an<br>
 affectionate term for the "slave," \doulos\ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->2)</i></b>, who was<br>
 "dear" to him.<br>
 <br>
 7:8 <B>{"Set"}</B> <b><i>(\tassomenos\)</i></b>. Genuine here, though doubtful in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 8:9 where see discussion of this vivid and characteristic speech<br>
 of the centurion.<br>
 <br>
 7:9 <B>{Turned}</B> <b><i>(\strapheis\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive participle of<br>
 \streph&#333;\, to turn. Common verb. A vivid touch not in Matthew's<br>
 account. In both Matthew and Luke Jesus marvels at the great<br>
 faith of this Roman centurion beyond that among the Jews. As a<br>
 military man he had learned how to receive orders and to execute<br>
 them and hence to expect obedience to his commands, He recognized<br>
 Jesus as Master over disease with power to compel obedience.<br>
 <br>
 7:10 <B>{Whole}</B> <b><i>(\hugiainonta\)</i></b>. Sound, well. See <!-#-->Lu 5:31.<br>
 <br>
 7:11 <B>{Soon afterwards}</B> <b><i>(\en toi hex&#275;s\)</i></b>. According to this<br>
 reading supply \chron&#333;i\, time. Other MSS. read \t&#275;i hex&#275;s\<br>
 <b><i>(supply \h&#275;mer&#257;i\, day)</i></b>. \Hex&#275;s\ occurs in Luke and Acts in the<br>
 N.T. though old adverb of time. <B>{That}</B> <b><i>(\Hoti\)</i></b>. Not in the<br>
 Greek, the two verbs \egeneto\ and \eporeuth&#275;\ having no<br>
 connective <b><i>(asyndeton)</i></b>. <B>{Went with him}</B> <b><i>(\suneporeuonto aut&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect middle picturing the procession of disciples and the<br>
 crowd with Jesus. Nain is not mentioned elsewhere in the N.T.<br>
 There is today a hamlet about two miles west of Endor on the<br>
 north slope of Little Hermon. There is a burying-place still in<br>
 use. Robinson and Stanley think that the very road on which the<br>
 crowd with Jesus met the funeral procession can be identified.<br>
 <br>
 7:12 <B>{Behold}</B> <b><i>(\kai idou\)</i></b>. The \kai\ introduces the apodosis of<br>
 the temporal sentence and has to be left out in translations. It<br>
 is a common idiom in Luke, \kai idou\. <B>{There was carried out}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\exekomizeto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive indicative. Common verb in<br>
 late Greek for carrying out a body for burial, though here only<br>
 in the N.T. <b><i>(\ekkomiz&#333;\)</i></b>. Rock tombs outside of the village exist<br>
 there today. <B>{One that was dead}</B> <b><i>(\tethn&#275;k&#333;s\)</i></b>. Perfect active<br>
 participle of \thn&#275;sk&#333;\, to die. <B>{The only son of his mother}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\monogen&#275;s huios t&#275;i m&#275;tri auto&#8211;\)</i></b>. Only begotten son to his<br>
 mother <b><i>(dative case)</i></b>. The compound adjective \monogen&#275;s\ <b><i>(\monos\<br>
 and \genos\)</i></b> is common in the old Greek and occurs in the N.T.<br>
 about Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 3:16,18)</i></b>. The "death of a widow's only son was<br>
 the greatest misfortune conceivable" <b><i>(Easton)</i></b>. <B>{And she was a<br>
 widow}</B> <b><i>(\kai aut&#275; &#275;n ch&#275;ra\)</i></b>. This word \ch&#275;ra\ gives the<br>
 finishing touch to the pathos of the situation. The word is from<br>
 \ch&#275;ros\, bereft. The mourning of a widow for an only son is the<br>
 extremity of grief <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{Much people}</B> <b><i>(\ochlos hikanos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Considerable crowd as often with this adjective \hikanos\. Some<br>
 were hired mourners, but the size of the crowd showed the real<br>
 sympathy of the town for her.<br>
 <br>
 7:13 <B>{The Lord saw her}</B> <b><i>(\id&#333;n aut&#275;n ho kurios\)</i></b>. The Lord of<br>
 Life confronts death <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b> and Luke may use \Kurios\ here<br>
 purposely. <B>{Had compassion}</B> <b><i>(\esplagchth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> passive indicative of \splagchnizomai\. Often love<br>
 and pity are mentioned as the motives for Christ's miracles <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 14:14; 15:32, etc.)</i></b>. It is confined to the Synoptics in the N.T.<br>
 and about Christ save in the parables by Christ. <B>{Weep not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;<br>
 klaie\)</i></b>. Present imperative in a prohibition. Cease weeping.<br>
 <br>
 7:14 <B>{Touched the bier}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;psato tou sorou\)</i></b>. An urn for the<br>
 bones or ashes of the dead in Homer, then the coffin <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 5:26)</i></b>,<br>
 then the funeral couch or bier as here. Only here in the N.T.<br>
 Jesus touched the bier to make the bearers stop, which they did<br>
 <b><i>(<B>{stood still}</B>, \est&#275;san\)</i></b>, second aorist active indicative of<br>
 \hist&#275;mi\.<br>
 <br>
 7:15 <B>{Sat up}</B> <b><i>(\anekathisen\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative.<br>
 The verb in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ac 9:40. Medical writers<br>
 often used it of the sick sitting up in bed <b><i>(Hobart, _Med. Lang.<br>
 of St. Luke_, p. 11)</i></b>. It is objected that the symmetry of these<br>
 cases <b><i>(daughter of Jairus raised from the death-bed, this widow's<br>
 son raised from the bier, Lazarus raised from the tomb)</i></b> is<br>
 suspicious, but no one Gospel gives all three <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{Gave<br>
 him to his mother}</B> <b><i>(\ed&#333;ken auton t&#275;i m&#275;tri autou\)</i></b>. Tender way<br>
 of putting it. "For he had already ceased to belong to his<br>
 mother" <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>. So in <!-#-->Lu 9:42.<br>
 <br>
 7:16 <B>{Fear seized all}</B> <b><i>(\elaben de phobos pantas\)</i></b>. Aorist active<br>
 indicative. At once. <B>{They glorified God}</B> <b><i>(\edoxazon ton theon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active, inchoative, began and increased.<br>
 <br>
 7:17 <B>{This report}</B> <b><i>(\ho logos houtos\)</i></b>. That God had raised up a<br>
 great prophet who had shown his call by raising the dead.<br>
 <br>
 7:18 <B>{And the disciples of John told him}</B> <b><i>(\kai ap&#275;ggeilan I&#333;an&#275;i<br>
 hoi math&#275;tai autou\)</i></b>. Literally, and his disciples announced to<br>
 John. Such news <b><i>(verse <!-#-->17)</i></b> was bound to come to the ears of the<br>
 Baptist languishing in the dungeon of Machaerus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 3:20)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu<br>
 7:18-35 runs parallel with <!-#-->Mt 11:2-19, a specimen of Q, the<br>
 non-Marcan portion of Matthew and Luke.<br>
 <br>
 7:19 <B>{Calling unto him}</B> <b><i>(\proskalesamenos\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 <b><i>(indirect)</i></b> participle. <B>{Two}</B> <b><i>(\duo tinas\)</i></b>. Certain two. Not in<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 11:2. <B>{Saying}</B> <b><i>(\leg&#333;n\)</i></b>. John saying by the two messengers.<br>
 The message is given precisely alike in <!-#-->Mt 11:3, which see. In<br>
 both we have \heteron\ for "another," either a second or a<br>
 different kind. In verse <!-#-->20 Westcott and Hort read \allon\ in<br>
 the text, \heteron\ in the margin. \Prosdok&#333;men\, may be present<br>
 indicative or present subjunctive <b><i>(deliberative)</i></b>, the same<br>
 contract form <b><i>(\ao= &#333;, a&#333; &#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:21 <B>{In that hour he cured}</B> <b><i>(\en ekein&#275;i t&#275;i hor&#257;i<br>
 etherapeusen\)</i></b>. This item is not in Matthew. Jesus gave the two<br>
 disciples of John an example of the direct method. They had<br>
 heard. Then they saw for themselves. <B>{Diseases}</B> <b><i>(\nos&#333;n\)</i></b>,<br>
 <B>{plagues}</B> <b><i>(\mastig&#333;n\)</i></b>, <B>{evil spirits}</B> <b><i>(\pneumat&#333;n pon&#275;r&#333;n\)</i></b>, all<br>
 kinds of bodily ills, and he singles out the <B>{blind}</B> <b><i>(\tuphlois\)</i></b><br>
 to whom in particular he bestowed sight <b><i>(\echarizato blepein\)</i></b>,<br>
 gave as a free gift <b><i>(from \charis\, grace)</i></b> seeing <b><i>(\blepein\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:22 <B>{What things ye have seen and heard}</B> <b><i>(\ha eidete kai<br>
 &#275;kousate\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Mt 11:4, present tense "which ye do hear and<br>
 see." Rest of verse <!-#-->22,23 as in <!-#-->Mt 11:4-6, which see for<br>
 details. Luke mentions no raisings from the dead in verse <!-#-->21,<br>
 but the language is mainly general, while here it is specific.<br>
 \Skandalizomai\ used here has the double notion of to trip up and<br>
 to entrap and in the N.T. always means causing to sin.<br>
 <br>
 7:24 <B>{When the messengers of John were departed}</B> <b><i>(\apelthont&#333;n<br>
 t&#333;n aggel&#333;n I&#333;anou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute of aorist active<br>
 participle. <!-#-->Mt 11:7 has the present middle participle<br>
 \poreuomen&#333;n\, suggesting that Jesus began his eulogy of John as<br>
 soon as the messengers <b><i>(angels, Luke calls them)</i></b> were on their<br>
 way. The vivid questions about the people's interest in John are<br>
 precisely alike in both Matthew and Luke.<br>
 <br>
 7:25 <B>{Gorgeously apparelled}</B> <b><i>(\en himatism&#333;i endox&#333;i\)</i></b>. In<br>
 splendid clothing. Here alone in this sense in the N.T. <B>{And live<br>
 delicately}</B> <b><i>(\truph&#275;i\)</i></b>. From \thrupt&#333;\ to break down, to<br>
 enervate, an old word for luxurious living. See the verb<br>
 \trupha&#333;\ in <!-#-->Jas 5:5. <B>{In kings' courts}</B> <b><i>(\en tois<br>
 basileiois\)</i></b>. Only here in the N.T. <!-#-->Mt 11:8 has it "in kings'<br>
 houses." Verses <!-#-->26,27 are precisely alike in <!-#-->Mt 11:9,10,<br>
 which see for discussion.<br>
 <br>
 7:26 <B>{A prophet?}</B> <b><i>(\proph&#275;t&#275;n;\)</i></b>. A real prophet will always get<br>
 a hearing if he has a message from God. He is a for-speaker,<br>
 forth-teller <b><i>(\pro-ph&#275;t&#275;s\)</i></b>. He may or may not be a fore-teller.<br>
 The main thing is for the prophet to have a message from God<br>
 which he is willing to tell at whatever cost to himself. The word<br>
 of God came to John in the wilderness of Judea <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 3:2)</i></b>. That<br>
 made him a prophet. There is a prophetic element in every real<br>
 preacher of the Gospel. Real prophets become leaders and moulders<br>
 of men.<br>
 <br>
 7:28 <B>{There is none}</B> <b><i>(\oudeis estin\)</i></b>. No one exists, this means.<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 11:11 has \ouk eg&#275;gertai\ <b><i>(hath not arisen)</i></b>. See Matthew for<br>
 discussion of "but little" and "greater."<br>
 <br>
 7:29 <B>{Justified God}</B> <b><i>(\edikai&#333;san ton theon\)</i></b>. They considered<br>
 God just or righteous in making these demands of them. Even the<br>
 publicans did. They submitted to the baptism of John<br>
 
<b><i>(\baptisthentes to baptisma tou I&#333;anou\).</i></b> First aorist passive<br>
 participle with the cognate accusative retained in the passive.<br>
 Some writers consider verses <!-#-->29,30 a comment of Luke in the<br>
 midst of the eulogy of John by Jesus. This would be a remarkable<br>
 thing for so long a comment to be interjected. It is perfectly<br>
 proper as the saying of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 7:30 <B>{Rejected for themselves}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;thet&#275;san eis heautous\)</i></b>. The<br>
 first aorist active of \athete&#333;\ first seen in LXX and Polybius.<br>
 Occurs in the papyri. These legalistic interpreters of the law<br>
 refused to admit the need of confession of sin on their part and<br>
 so set aside the baptism of John. They annulled God's purposes of<br>
 grace so far as they applied to them. <B>{Being not baptized by him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275; baptisthentes hup' autou\)</i></b>. First aorist passive participle.<br>
 \M&#275;\ is the usual negative of the participle in the _Koin&#275;_.<br>
 <br>
 7:31 <B>{And to what are they like?}</B> <b><i>(\kai tini eisin homoioi;\)</i></b>.<br>
 This second question is not in <!-#-->Mt 11:16. It sharpens the point.<br>
 The case of \tini\ is associative instrumental after \homoioi\.<br>
 See discussion of details in Matthew.<br>
 <br>
 7:32 <B>{And ye did not weep}</B> <b><i>(\kai ouk eklausate\)</i></b>. Here <!-#-->Mt 1:17<br>
 has "and ye did not mourn <b><i>(or beat your breast, \ouk<br>
 ekopsasthe\)</i></b>. They all did it at funerals. These children would<br>
 not play wedding or funeral.<br>
 <br>
 7:33 <B>{John the Baptist is come}</B> <b><i>(\el&#275;luthen\)</i></b>. Second perfect<br>
 active indicative where <!-#-->Mt 11:18 has \&#275;lthen\ second aorist<br>
 active indicative. So as to verse <!-#-->34. Luke alone has "bread"<br>
 and "wine." Otherwise these verses like <!-#-->Mt 11:18,19, which see<br>
 for discussion of details. There are actually critics today who<br>
 say that Jesus was called the friend of sinners and even of<br>
 harlots because he loved them and their ways and so deserved the<br>
 slur cast upon him by his enemies. If men can say that today we<br>
 need not wonder that the Pharisees and lawyers said it then to<br>
 justify their own rejection of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 7:35 <B>{Of all her children}</B> <b><i>(\apo pant&#333;n t&#333;n tekn&#333;n aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Here<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 11:19 has "by her works" <b><i>(\apo t&#333;n erg&#333;n aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Aleph has<br>
 \erg&#333;n\ here. The use of "children" personifies wisdom as in <!-#-->Pr<br>
 8; 9.<br>
 <br>
 7:36 <B>{That he would eat with him}</B> <b><i>(\hina phag&#275;i met' autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist active subjunctive. The use of \hina\ after<br>
 \er&#333;ta&#333;\ <b><i>(see also <!-#-->Lu 16:27)</i></b> is on the border between the pure<br>
 object clause and the indirect question <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 1046)</i></b> and the pure final clause. Luke has two other instances of<br>
 Pharisees who invited Jesus to meals <b><i>(<!-#-->11:37; 14:1)</i></b> and he alone<br>
 gives them. This is the Gospel of Hospitality <b><i>(Ragg)</i></b>. Jesus would<br>
 dine with a Pharisee or with a publican <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 5:29; Mr 2:15; Mt<br>
 9:10)</i></b> and even invited himself to be the guest of Zaccheus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 9:5)</i></b>. This Pharisee was not as hostile as the leaders in<br>
 Jerusalem. It is not necessary to think this Pharisee had any<br>
 sinister motive in his invitation though he was not overly<br>
 friendly <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:37 <B>{A woman which was in the city, a sinner}</B> <b><i>(\gun&#275; h&#275;tis en<br>
 t&#275;i polei hamart&#333;los\)</i></b>. Probably in Capernaum. The use of \h&#275;tis\<br>
 means "Who was of such a character as to be" <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->8:3)</i></b> and so<br>
 more than merely the relative \h&#275;\, who, that is, "who was a<br>
 sinner in the city," a woman of the town, in other words, and<br>
 known to be such. \Hamart&#333;los\, from \hamartan&#333;\, to sin, means<br>
 devoted to sin and uses the same form for feminine and masculine.<br>
 It is false and unjust to Mary Magdalene, introduced as a new<br>
 character in <!-#-->Lu 8:2, to identify this woman with her. Luke<br>
 would have no motive in concealing her name here and the life of<br>
 a courtesan would be incompatible with the sevenfold possession<br>
 of demons. Still worse is it to identify this courtesan not only<br>
 with Mary Magdalene, but also with Mary of Bethany simply because<br>
 it is a Simon who gives there a feast to Jesus when Mary of<br>
 Bethany does a beautiful deed somewhat like this one here <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 14:3-9; Mt 26:6-13; Joh 12:2-8)</i></b>. Certainly Luke knew full well<br>
 the real character of Mary of Bethany <b><i>(<!-#-->10:38-42)</i></b> so beautifully<br>
 pictured by him. But a falsehood, once started, seems to have<br>
 more lives than the cat's proverbial nine. The very name<br>
 Magdalene has come to mean a repentant courtesan. But we can at<br>
 least refuse to countenance such a slander on Mary Magdalene and<br>
 on Mary of Bethany. This sinful woman had undoubtedly repented<br>
 and changed her life and wished to show her gratitude to Jesus<br>
 who had rescued her. Her bad reputation as a harlot clung to her<br>
 and made her an unwelcome visitor in the Pharisee's house. <B>{When<br>
 she knew}</B> <b><i>(\epignousa\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle from<br>
 \epigin&#333;sk&#333;\, to know fully, to recognize. She came in by a<br>
 curious custom of the time that allowed strangers to enter a<br>
 house uninvited at a feast, especially beggars seeking a gift.<br>
 This woman was an intruder whereas Mary of Bethany was an invited<br>
 guest. "Many came in and took their places on the side seats,<br>
 uninvited and yet unchallenged. They spoke to those at table on<br>
 business or the news of the day, and our host spoke freely to<br>
 them" <b><i>(Trench in his _Parables_, describing a dinner at a<br>
 Consul's house at Damietta)</i></b>. <B>{He was sitting at meat}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katakeitai\)</i></b>. Literally, he is reclining <b><i>(present tense<br>
 retained in indirect discourse in Greek)</i></b>. <B>{An alabaster cruse of<br>
 ointment}</B> <b><i>(\alabastron murou\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 26:7 for discussion<br>
 of \alabastron\ and \murou\.<br>
 <br>
 7:38 <B>{Standing behind at his feet}</B> <b><i>(\st&#257;sa opis&#333; para tous podas<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle from \hist&#275;mi\ and<br>
 intransitive, first aorist \est&#275;sa\ being transitive. The guest<br>
 removed his sandals before the meal and he reclined on the left<br>
 side with the feet outward. She was standing beside <b><i>(\para\)</i></b> his<br>
 feet <B>{weeping}</B> <b><i>(\klaiousa\)</i></b>. She was drawn irresistibly by<br>
 gratitude to Jesus and is overcome with emotion before she can<br>
 use the ointment; her tears <b><i>(\tois dakrusin\, instrumental case<br>
 of \dakru\)</i></b> take the place of the ointment. <B>{Wiped them with the<br>
 hair of her head}</B> <b><i>(\tais thrixin t&#275;s kephal&#275;s aut&#275;s exemassen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Inchoative imperfect of an old verb \ekmass&#333;\, to rub out or off,<br>
 began to wipe off, an act of impulse evidently and of<br>
 embarrassment. "Among the Jews it was a shameful thing for a<br>
 woman to let down her hair in public; but she makes this<br>
 sacrifice" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. So Mary of Bethany wiped the feet of Jesus<br>
 with her hair <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 12:3)</i></b> with a similar sacrifice out of her<br>
 great love for Jesus. This fact is relied on by some to prove<br>
 that Mary of Bethany had been a woman of bad character, surely an<br>
 utter failure to recognize Mary's motive and act. <B>{Kissed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katephilei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \kataphile&#333;\, to kiss<br>
 repeatedly <b><i>(force of \kata\)</i></b>, and accented by the tense of<br>
 continued action here. The word in the N.T. occurs here, of the<br>
 prodigal's father <b><i>(<!-#-->15:20)</i></b>, of the kiss of Judas <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:45; Mt<br>
 26:49)</i></b>, of the Ephesian elders <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:37)</i></b>. " Kissing the feet<br>
 was a common mark of deep reverence, especially to leading<br>
 rabbis" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{Anointed them with the ointment}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;leiphen<br>
 t&#333;i mur&#333;i\)</i></b>. Imperfect active again of \aleiph&#333;\, a very common<br>
 verb. \Chri&#333;\ has a more religious sense. The anointing came<br>
 after the burst of emotional excitement.<br>
 <br>
 7:39 <B>{This man}</B> <b><i>(\houtos\)</i></b>. Contemptuous, this fellow. <B>{If he<br>
 were a <b><i>(the)</i></b> prophet}</B> <b><i>(\ei &#275;n [ho] proph&#275;t&#275;s\)</i></b>. Condition of the<br>
 second class, determined as unfulfilled. The Pharisee assumes<br>
 that Jesus is not a prophet <b><i>(or the prophet, reading of B, that<br>
 he claims to be)</i></b>. A Greek condition puts the thing from the<br>
 standpoint of the speaker or writer. It does not deal with the<br>
 actual facts, but only with the statement about the facts. <B>{Would<br>
 have perceived}</B> <b><i>(\egin&#333;sken an\)</i></b>. Wrong translation, would now<br>
 perceive or know <b><i>(which he assumes that Jesus does not do)</i></b>. The<br>
 protasis is false and the conclusion also. He is wrong in both.<br>
 The conclusion <b><i>(apodosis)</i></b>, like the condition, deals here with<br>
 the present situation and so both use the imperfect indicative<br>
 <b><i>(\an\ in the conclusion, a mere device for making it plain that<br>
 it is not a condition of the first class)</i></b>. <B>{Who and what manner<br>
 of woman}</B> <b><i>(\tis kai potap&#275; h&#275; gun&#275;\)</i></b>. She was notorious in person<br>
 and character.<br>
 <br>
 7:40 <B>{Answering}</B> <b><i>(\apokritheis\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 participle, redundant use with \eipen\. Jesus answers the<br>
 thoughts and doubts of Simon and so shows that he knows all about<br>
 the woman also. Godet notes a tone of Socratic irony here.<br>
 <br>
 7:41 <B>{A certain lender}</B> <b><i>(\danist&#275;i tini\)</i></b>. A lender of money with<br>
 interest. Here alone in the N.T. though a common word. <B>{Debtors}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\chreophiletai\)</i></b>. From \chre&#333;\ <b><i>(debt, obligation)</i></b> and \opheil&#333;\,<br>
 to owe. Only here and <!-#-->16:5 in the N.T., though common in late<br>
 Greek writers. <B>{Owed}</B> <b><i>(\&#333;pheilen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active and so<br>
 unpaid. Five hundred \d&#275;naria\ and fifty like two hundred and<br>
 fifty dollars and twenty-five dollars.<br>
 <br>
 7:42 <B>{Will love him most}</B> <b><i>(\pleion agap&#275;sei auton\)</i></b>. Strictly,<br>
 comparative <B>{more}</B>, \pleion\, not superlative \pleista\, but most<br>
 suits the English idiom best, even between two. Superlative forms<br>
 are vanishing before the comparative in the _Koin&#275;_. This is the<br>
 point of the parable, the attitude of the two debtors toward the<br>
 lender who forgave both of them <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:43 <B>{I suppose}</B> <b><i>(\hupolamban&#333;\)</i></b>. Old verb, originally to take up<br>
 from under, to bear away as on high, to take up in speech <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 10:30)</i></b>, to take up in mind or to assume as here and <!-#-->Ac 2:15.<br>
 Here with an air of supercilious indifference <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{The<br>
 most}</B> <b><i>(\to pleion\)</i></b>. The more. <B>{Rightly}</B> <b><i>(\orth&#333;s\)</i></b>. Correctly.<br>
 Socrates was fond of \panu orth&#333;s\. The end of the argument.<br>
 <br>
 7:44 <B>{Turning}</B> <b><i>(\strapheis\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive participle.<br>
 <B>{Seest thou}</B> <b><i>(\blepeis\)</i></b>. For the first time Jesus looks at the<br>
 woman and he asks the Pharisee to look at her. She was behind<br>
 Jesus. Jesus was an invited guest. The Pharisee had neglected<br>
 some points of customary hospitality. The contrasts here made<br>
 have the rhythm of Hebrew poetry. In each contrast the first word<br>
 is the point of defect in Simon: <B>{water}</B> <b><i>(44)</i></b>, <B>{kiss}</B> <b><i>(45)</i></b>, <B>{oil}</B><br>
 <b><i>(46)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:45 <B>{Hath not ceased to kiss}</B> <b><i>(\ou dielipen kataphilousa\)</i></b>.<br>
 Supplementary participle.<br>
 <br>
 7:46 <B>{With ointment}</B> <b><i>(\mur&#333;i\)</i></b>. Instrumental case. She used the<br>
 costly ointment even for the feet of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 7:47 <B>{Are forgiven}</B> <b><i>(\aphe&#333;ntai\)</i></b>. Doric perfect passive form.<br>
 See <!-#-->Lu 5:21,23. <B>{For she loved much}</B> <b><i>(\hoti &#275;gap&#275;sen polu\)</i></b>.<br>
 Illustration or proof, not reason for the forgiveness. Her sins<br>
 had been already forgiven and remained forgiven. <B>{But to whom<br>
 little is forgiven, the same loveth little}</B> <b><i>(\H&#333;i de oligon<br>
 aphietai oligon agap&#257;i\)</i></b>. This explanation proves that the<br>
 meaning of \hoti\ preceding is proof, not cause.<br>
 <br>
 7:48 <B>{Are forgiven}</B> <b><i>(\aphe&#333;ntai\)</i></b>. As in verse <!-#-->47. Remain<br>
 forgiven, Jesus means, in spite of the slur of the Pharisee.<br>
 <br>
 7:49 <B>{Who even forgiveth sins}</B> <b><i>(\hos kai hamartias aphi&#275;sin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present indicative active of same verb, \aphi&#275;mi\. Once before<br>
 the Pharisees considered Jesus guilty of blasphemy in claiming<br>
 the power to forgive sins <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 5:21)</i></b>. Jesus read their inmost<br>
 thoughts as he always does.<br>
