<p>1:1 <B>{Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy}</B> <b><i>(\Paulos kai Silouanos kai<br>
 Timotheos\)</i></b>. Nominative absolute as customary in letters. Paul<br>
 associates with himself Silvanus <b><i>(Silas of Acts, spelled<br>
 \Silbanos\ in D and the papyri)</i></b>, a Jew and Roman citizen, and<br>
 Timothy, son of Jewish mother and Greek father, one of Paul's<br>
 converts at Lystra on the first tour. They had both been with<br>
 Paul at Thessalonica, though Timothy is not mentioned by Luke in<br>
 Acts in Macedonia till Beroea <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 17:14f.)</i></b>. Timothy had joined<br>
 Paul in Athens <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 3:1f.)</i></b>, had been sent back to Thessalonica,<br>
 and with Silas had rejoined Paul in Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 3:5; Ac 18:5,<br>
 2Co 1:19)</i></b>. Silas is the elder and is mentioned first, but<br>
 neither is in any sense the author of the Epistle any more than<br>
 Sosthenes is co-author of I Corinthians or Timothy of II<br>
 Corinthians, though Paul may sometimes have them in mind when he<br>
 uses "we" in the Epistle. Paul does not here call himself<br>
 "apostle" as in the later Epistles, perhaps because his position<br>
 has not been so vigorously attacked as it was later. Ellicott<br>
 sees in the absence of the word here a mark of the affectionate<br>
 relations existing between Paul and the Thessalonians. <B>{Unto the<br>
 church of the Thessalonians}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i ekkl&#275;si&#257;i Thessalonike&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 The dative case in address. Note absence of the article with<br>
 \Thessalonike&#333;n\ because a proper name and so definite without<br>
 it. This is the common use of \ekkl&#275;sia\ for a local body<br>
 <b><i>(church)</i></b>. The word originally meant "assembly" as in <!-#-->Ac 19:39,<br>
 but it came to mean an organization for worship whether assembled<br>
 or unassembled <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ac 8:3)</i></b>. The only superscription in the<br>
 oldest Greek manuscripts <b><i>(Aleph B A)</i></b> is \Pros Thessalonikeis A\<br>
 <b><i>(<B>{To the Thessalonians First}</B>)</i></b>. But probably Paul wrote no<br>
 superscription and certainly he would not write A to it before he<br>
 had written II Thessalonians <b><i>(B)</i></b>. His signature at the close was<br>
 the proof of genuineness <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 3:17)</i></b> against all spurious<br>
 claimants <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 2:2)</i></b>. Unfortunately the brittle papyrus on which<br>
 he wrote easily perished outside of the sand heaps and tombs of<br>
 Egypt or the lava covered ruins of Herculaneum. What a treasure<br>
 that autograph would be! <B>{In God the Father and the Lord Jesus<br>
 Christ}</B> <b><i>(\en the&#333;i patri kai kuri&#333;i J&#275;sou Christ&#333;i\)</i></b>. This church<br>
 is grounded in <b><i>(\en\, with the locative case)</i></b> and exists in the<br>
 sphere and power of <B>{God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ}</B>.<br>
 No article in the Greek, for both \the&#333;i patri\ and \kuri&#333;i J&#275;sou<br>
 Christ&#333;i\ are treated as proper names. In the very beginning of<br>
 this first Epistle of Paul we meet his Christology. He at once<br>
 uses the full title, "Lord Jesus Christ," with all the<br>
 theological content of each word. The name "Jesus" <b><i>(Saviour, <!-#-->Mt<br>
 1:21)</i></b> he knew, as the "Jesus of history," the personal name of<br>
 the Man of Galilee, whom he had once persecuted <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 9:5)</i></b>, but<br>
 whom he at once, after his conversion, proclaimed to be "the<br>
 Messiah," <b><i>(\ho Christos\, <!-#-->Ac 9:22)</i></b>. This position Paul never<br>
 changed. In the great sermon at Antioch in Pisidia which Luke has<br>
 preserved <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 13:23)</i></b> Paul proved that God fulfilled his promise<br>
 to Israel by raising up "Jesus as Saviour" <b><i>(\s&#333;t&#275;ra I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. Now<br>
 Paul follows the Christian custom by adding \Christos\ <b><i>(verbal<br>
 from \chri&#333;\, to anoint)</i></b> as a proper name to Jesus <b><i>(Jesus Christ)</i></b><br>
 as later he will often say "Christ Jesus" <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 1:1)</i></b>. And he<br>
 dares also to apply \kurios\ <b><i>(Lord)</i></b> to "Jesus Christ," the word<br>
 appropriated by Claudius <b><i>(_Dominus_, \Kurios\)</i></b> and other emperors<br>
 in the emperor-worship, and also common in the Septuagint for God<br>
 as in <!-#-->Ps 32:1f. <b><i>(quoted by Paul in <!-#-->Ro 4:8)</i></b>. Paul uses<br>
 \Kurios\ of God <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 3:5)</i></b> or of Jesus Christ as here. In fact,<br>
 he more frequently applies it to Christ when not quoting the Old<br>
 Testament as in <!-#-->Ro 4:8. And here he places "the Lord Jesus<br>
 Christ" in the same category and on the same plane with "God the<br>
 father." There will be growth in Paul's Christology and he will<br>
 never attain all the knowledge of Christ for which he longs <b><i>(<!-#-->Php<br>
 3:10-12)</i></b>, but it is patent that here in his first Epistle there<br>
 is no "reduced Christ" for Paul. He took Jesus as "Lord" when he<br>
 surrendered to Jesus on the Damascus Road: "And I said, What<br>
 shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 22:10)</i></b>. It is<br>
 impossible to understand Paul without seeing clearly this first<br>
 and final stand for the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul did not get this<br>
 view of Jesus from current views of Mithra or of Isis or any<br>
 other alien faith. The Risen Christ became at once for Paul the<br>
 Lord of his life. <B>{Grace to you and peace}</B> <b><i>(\charis humin kai<br>
 eir&#275;n&#275;\)</i></b>. These words, common in Paul's Epistles, bear "the stamp<br>
 of Paul's experience" <b><i>(Milligan)</i></b>. They are not commonplace<br>
 salutations, but the old words "deepened and spiritualised"<br>
 <b><i>(Frame)</i></b>. The infinitive <b><i>(\chairein\)</i></b> so common in the papyri<br>
 letters and seen in the New Testament also <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:23; 23:26; Jas<br>
 1:1)</i></b> here gives place to \charis\, one of the great words of the<br>
 New Testament <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Joh 1:16f.)</i></b> and particularly of the Pauline<br>
 Epistles. Perhaps no one word carries more meaning for Paul's<br>
 messages than this word \charis\ <b><i>(from \chair&#333;\, rejoice)</i></b> from<br>
 which \charizomai\ comes. <B>{Peace}</B> <b><i>(\eir&#275;n&#275;\)</i></b> is more than the<br>
 Hebrew _shal&#333;m_ so common in salutations. One recalls the "peace"<br>
 that Christ leaves to us <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 14:27)</i></b> and the peace of God that<br>
 passes all understanding <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 4:7)</i></b>. This introduction is brief,<br>
 but rich and gracious and pitches the letter at once on a high<br>
 plane.<br>
 <br>
 1:2 <B>{We give thanks}</B> <b><i>(\eucharistoumen\)</i></b>. Late denominative verb<br>
 \euchariste&#333;\ from \eucharistos\ <b><i>(grateful)</i></b> and that from \eu\,<br>
 well and \charizomai\, to show oneself kind. See \charis\ in<br>
 verse <!-#-->1. "The plural implies that all three missionaries prayed<br>
 together" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>. <B>{Always}</B> <b><i>(\pantote\)</i></b>. Late word, rare in<br>
 LXX. So with \euchariste&#333;\ in <!-#-->2Th 1:3; 2:13; 1Co 1:4; Eph 5:20;<br>
 Php 1:3. Moffatt takes it to mean "whenever Paul was at his<br>
 prayers." Of course, he did not make audible prayer always, but<br>
 he was always in the spirit of prayer, "a constant attitude"<br>
 <b><i>(Milligan)</i></b>, "in tune with the Infinite." <B>{For you all}</B> <b><i>(\peri<br>
 pant&#333;n hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Paul "encircled <b><i>(\peri\, around)</i></b> them all,"<br>
 including every one of them and the church as a whole. Distance<br>
 lends enchantment to the memory of slight drawbacks. Paul is fond<br>
 of this phrase "you all," particularly in Phil. <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 1:3,7)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Making mention}</B> <b><i>(\mneian poioumenoi\)</i></b>. Paul uses this very idiom<br>
 in <!-#-->Rom 1:9; Eph 1:16; Phm 1:4. Milligan cites a papyrus example<br>
 of \mneian poioumenoi\ in prayer <b><i>(B. Y. U. 652, 5)</i></b>. Did Paul have<br>
 a prayer list of the Thessalonian disciples which he read over<br>
 with Silas and Timothy? <B>{In}</B> here is \epi=\"in the time of our<br>
 prayers." "Each time that they are engaged in prayers the writers<br>
 mention the names of the converts" <b><i>(Frame)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:3 <B>{Remembering}</B> <b><i>(\mn&#275;moneuontes\)</i></b>. Present active participle of<br>
 old verb from adjective \mn&#275;m&#333;n\ <b><i>(mindful)</i></b> and so to call to<br>
 mind, to be mindful of, used either with the accusative as in<br>
 <!-#-->1Th 2:9 or the genitive as here. <B>{Without ceasing}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\adialeipt&#333;s\)</i></b>. Double compound adverb of the _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(Polybius,<br>
 Diodorus, Strabo, papyri)</i></b> from the verbal adjective<br>
 \a-dia-leiptos\ <b><i>(\a\ privative and \dia-leip&#333;\, to leave off)</i></b>. In<br>
 the N.T. alone by Paul and always connected with prayer. Milligan<br>
 prefers to connect this adverb <b><i>(amphibolous in position)</i></b> with the<br>
 preceding participle \poioumenoi\ rather than with<br>
 \mn&#275;moneuontes\ as Revised Version and Westcott and Hort rightly<br>
 do. <B>{Your work of faith}</B> <b><i>(\hum&#333;n tou ergou t&#275;s piste&#333;s\)</i></b>. Note<br>
 article with both \ergou\ and \piste&#333;s\ <b><i>(correlation of the<br>
 article, both abstract substantives)</i></b>. \Ergou\ is genitive case<br>
 the object of \mn&#275;moneuontes\ as is common with verbs of emotion<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 508f.)</i></b>, though the accusative \kopon\<br>
 occurs in <!-#-->1Th 2:9 according to common Greek idiom allowing<br>
 either case. \Ergou\ is the general term for work or business,<br>
 employment, task. Note two genitives with \ergou\. \Hum&#333;n\ is the<br>
 usual possessive genitive, <B>{your work}</B>, while \t&#275;s piste&#333;s\ is<br>
 the descriptive genitive, marked by, characterized by, faith,<br>
 "the activity that faith inspires" <b><i>(Frame)</i></b>. It is interesting to<br>
 note this sharp conjunction of these two words by Paul. We are<br>
 justified by faith, but faith produces works <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 6-8)</i></b> as the<br>
 Baptist taught and as Jesus taught and as James does in <!-#-->Jas 2.<br>
 <B>{Labour of love}</B> <b><i>(\tou kopou t&#275;s agap&#275;s\)</i></b>. Note article with both<br>
 substantives. Here again \tou kopou\ is the genitive the object<br>
 of \mn&#275;moneuontes\ while \t&#275;s agap&#275;s\ is the descriptive genitive<br>
 characterizing the "labour" or "toil" more exactly. \Kopos\ is<br>
 from \kopt&#333;\, to cut, to lash, to beat the bread, to toil. In <!-#-->Re<br>
 14:13 the distinction is drawn between \kopou\ <b><i>(toil)</i></b> from which<br>
 the saints rest and \erga\ <b><i>(works, activities)</i></b> which follow with<br>
 them into heaven. So here it is the labour that love prompts,<br>
 assuming gladly the toil. \Agap&#275;\ is one of the great words of<br>
 the N.T. <b><i>(Milligan)</i></b> and no certain example has yet been found in<br>
 the early papyri or the inscriptions. It occurs in the Septuagint<br>
 in the higher sense as with the sensuous associations. The<br>
 Epistle of Aristeas calls love <b><i>(\agap&#275;\)</i></b> God's gift and Philo<br>
 uses \agap&#275;\ in describing love for God. "When Christianity first<br>
 began to think and speak in Greek, it took up \agap&#275;\ and its<br>
 group of terms more freely, investing them with the new glow with<br>
 which the N.T. writings make us familiar, a content which is<br>
 invariably religious" <b><i>(Moffatt, _Love in the New Testament_, p.<br>
 40)</i></b>. The New Testament never uses the word \er&#333;s\ <b><i>(lust)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Patience of hope}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;s hupomon&#275;s t&#275;s elpidos\)</i></b>. Note the two<br>
 articles again and the descriptive genitive \t&#275;s elpidos\. It is<br>
 patience marked by hope, "the endurance inspired by hope"<br>
 <b><i>(Frame)</i></b>, yes, and sustained by hope in spite of delays and<br>
 set-backs. \Hupomon&#275;\ is an old word <b><i>(\hupo, men&#333;\, to remain<br>
 under)</i></b>, but it "has come like \agap&#275;\ to be closely associated<br>
 with a distinctively Christian virtue" <b><i>(Milligan)</i></b>. The same order<br>
 as here <b><i>(\ergou, kopos, hupomon&#275;\)</i></b> appears in <!-#-->Re 2:2 and<br>
 Lightfoot considers it" an ascending scale as practical proofs of<br>
 self-sacrifice." The church in Thessalonica was not old, but<br>
 already they were called upon to exercise the sanctifying grace<br>
 of hope <b><i>(Denney)</i></b>. <B>{In our Lord Jesus Christ}</B> <b><i>(\tou Kuriou h&#275;m&#333;n<br>
 I&#275;sou Christou\)</i></b>. The objective genitive with \elpidos\ <b><i>(hope)</i></b><br>
 and so translated by "in" here <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 499f.)</i></b>.<br>
 Jesus is the object of this hope, the hope of his second coming<br>
 which is still open to us. Note "Lord Jesus Christ" as in verse<br>
 <!-#-->1. <B>{Before our God and Father}</B> <b><i>(\emprosthen tou theou kai<br>
 patros h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. The one article with both substantives precisely<br>
 as in <!-#-->Ga 1:4, not "before God and our Father," both article and<br>
 possessive genitive going with both substantives as in <!-#-->2Pe<br>
 1:1,11; Tit 2:13 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 785f.)</i></b>. The phrase<br>
 is probably connected with \elpidos\. \Emprosthen\ in the N.T.<br>
 occurs only of place, but it is common in the papyri of time. The<br>
 picture here is the day of judgment when all shall appear before<br>
 God.<br>
 <br>
 1:4 <B>{Knowing}</B> <b><i>(\eidotes\)</i></b>. Second perfect active participle of<br>
 \oida\ <b><i>(\eidon\)</i></b>, a so-called causal participle=since we know,<br>
 the third participle with the principal verb \eucharistoumen\,<br>
 the Greek being fond of the circumstantial participle and<br>
 lengthening sentences thereby <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, P. 1128)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Beloved by God}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;gap&#275;menoi hupo [tou] theou\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle of \agapa&#333;\, the verb so common in the N.T. for the<br>
 highest kind of love. Paul is not content with the use of<br>
 \adelphoi\ here <b><i>(often in this Epistle as <!-#-->2:1,14,17; 3:7;<br>
 4:1,10)</i></b>, but adds this affectionate phrase nowhere else in the<br>
 N.T. in this form <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Jude 1:3)</i></b> though in Sirach 45:1 and on<br>
 the Rosetta Stone. But in <!-#-->2Th 2:13 he quotes "beloved by the<br>
 Lord" from <!-#-->De 33:12. The use of \adelphoi\ for members of the<br>
 same brotherhood can be derived from the Jewish custom <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 2:29,37)</i></b> and the habit of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 12:48)</i></b> and is amply<br>
 illustrated in the papyri for burial clubs and other orders and<br>
 guilds <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan's _Vocabulary_)</i></b>. <B>{Your election}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\t&#275;n eklog&#275;n hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. That is the election of you by God. It is<br>
 an old word from \eklegomai\ used by Jesus of his choice of the<br>
 twelve disciples <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 15:16)</i></b> and by Paul of God's eternal<br>
 selection <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph 1:4)</i></b>. The word \eklog&#275;\ is not in the LXX and<br>
 only seven times in the N.T. and always of God's choice of men<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 9:15; 1Th 1:4; Ro 9:11; 11:5,7,58; 2Pe 1:10)</i></b>. The divine<br>
 \eklog&#275;\ was manifested in the Christian qualities of verse <!-#-->3<br>
 <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:5 <B>{How that}</B> <b><i>(\hoti\)</i></b>. It is not certain whether \hoti\ here<br>
 means "because" <b><i>(\quia\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->2Th 3:7; 1Co 2:14; Ro 8:27 or<br>
 declarative \hoti\ "how that," knowing the circumstances of your<br>
 election <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b> or explanatory, as in <!-#-->Ac 16:3; 1Th 2:1; 1Co<br>
 16:15; 2Co 12:3f.; Ro 13:11. <B>{Our gospel}</B> <b><i>(\to euaggelion<br>
 h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. The gospel <b><i>(see on &#175;Mt 4:23; Mr 1:1,15 for<br>
 \euaggelion\)</i></b> which we preach, Paul's phrase also in <!-#-->2Th 2:14;<br>
 2Co 4:3; Ro 2:16; 16:25; 2Ti 2:8. Paul had a definite, clear-cut<br>
 message of grace that he preached everywhere including<br>
 Thessalonica. This message is to be interpreted in the light of<br>
 Paul's own sermons in Acts and Epistles, not by reading backward<br>
 into them the later perversions of Gnostics and sacramentarians.<br>
 This very word was later applied to the books about Jesus, but<br>
 Paul is not so using the term here or anywhere else. In its<br>
 origin Paul's gospel is of God <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 2:2,8,9)</i></b>, in its substance<br>
 it is Christ's <b><i>(<!-#-->3:2; 2Th 1:8)</i></b>, and Paul is only the bearer of<br>
 it <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 2:4,9; 2Th 2:14)</i></b> as Milligan points out. Paul and his<br>
 associates have been entrusted with this gospel <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 2:4)</i></b> and<br>
 preach it <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 2:2)</i></b>. Elsewhere Paul calls it God's gospel <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co<br>
 11:7; Ro 1:1; 15:16)</i></b> or Christs <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 9:12; 2Co 2:12; 9:13;<br>
 10:14; Ga 1:7; Ro 15:19; Php 1:27)</i></b>. In both instances it is the<br>
 subjective genitive. <B>{Came unto you}</B> <b><i>(\egen&#275;th&#275; eis hum&#257;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive indicative of \ginomai\ in practically same<br>
 sense as \egeneto\ <b><i>(second aorist middle indicative as in the<br>
 late Greek generally)</i></b>. So also \eis hum&#257;s\ like the _Koin&#275;_ is<br>
 little more than the dative \humin\ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 594)</i></b>. <B>{Not only--but also}</B> <b><i>(\ouk--monon, alla kai\)</i></b>. Sharp<br>
 contrast, negatively and positively. The contrast between \logos\<br>
 <b><i>(word)</i></b> and \dunamis\ <b><i>(power)</i></b> is seen also in <!-#-->1Co 2:4; 4:20.<br>
 Paul does not refer to miracles by \dunamis\. <B>{In the Holy Spirit<br>
 and much assurance}</B> <b><i>(\en pneumati hagi&#333;i kai pl&#275;rophori&#257;i<br>
 poll&#275;i\)</i></b>. Preposition \en\ repeated with \log&#333;i, dunamei\, but<br>
 only once here thus uniting closely <B>{Holy Spirit}</B> and <B>{much<br>
 assurance}</B>. No article with either word. The word \pl&#275;rophori&#257;i\<br>
 is not found in ancient Greek or the LXX. It appears once in<br>
 Clement of Rome and one broken papyrus example. For the verb<br>
 \pl&#275;rophore&#333;\ see on &#175;Lu 1:1. The substantive in the N.T. only<br>
 here and <!-#-->Col 2:2; Heb 6:11; 10:22. It means the full confidence<br>
 which comes from the Holy Spirit. <B>{Even as ye know}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s<br>
 oidate\)</i></b>. Paul appeals to the Thessalonians themselves as<br>
 witnesses to the character of his preaching and life among them.<br>
 <B>{What manner of men we showed ourselves toward you}</B> <b><i>(\hoioi<br>
 egen&#275;th&#275;men humin\)</i></b>. Literally, <B>{What sort of men we became to<br>
 you}</B>. Qualitative relative \hoioi\ and dative \humin\ and first<br>
 aorist passive indicative \egen&#275;th&#275;men\, <b><i>(not \&#275;metha\, we were)</i></b>.<br>
 An epexegetical comment with <B>{for your sake}</B> <b><i>(\di' hum&#257;s\)</i></b> added.<br>
 It was all in their interest and for their advantage, however it<br>
 may have seemed otherwise at the time.<br>
 <br>
 1:6 <B>{Imitators of us and of the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\mim&#275;tai h&#275;m&#333;n kai tou<br>
 kuriou\)</i></b>. \Mim&#275;t&#275;s\ <b><i>(\-t&#275;s\ expresses the agent)</i></b> is from<br>
 \mimeomai\, to imitate and that from \mimos\ <b><i>(\mimic\, actor)</i></b>.<br>
 Old word, more than "followers," in the N.T. only six times <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th<br>
 1:6; 2:14; 1Co 4:16; 11:1; Eph 5:1; Heb 6:12)</i></b>. Again Paul uses<br>
 \ginomai\, to become, not \eimi\, to be. It is a daring thing to<br>
 expect people to "imitate" the preacher, but Paul adds "and of<br>
 the Lord," for he only expected or desired "imitation" as he<br>
 himself imitated the Lord Jesus, as he expressly says in <!-#-->1Co<br>
 11:1. The peril of it all is that people so easily and so<br>
 readily imitate the preacher when he does not imitate the Lord.<br>
 The fact of the "election" of the Thessalonians was shown by the<br>
 character of the message given them and by this sincere<br>
 acceptance of it <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. <B>{Having received the word}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dexamenoi ton logon\)</i></b>. First aorist middle participle of<br>
 \dechomai\, probably simultaneous action <b><i>(receiving)</i></b>, not<br>
 antecedent. <B>{In much affliction}</B> <b><i>(\en thlipsei poll&#275;i\)</i></b>. Late<br>
 word, pressure. Tribulation <b><i>(Latin _tribulum_)</i></b> from \thlib&#333;\, to<br>
 press hard on. Christianity has glorified this word. It occurs in<br>
 some Christian papyrus letters in this same sense. Runs all<br>
 through the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 1:4; Ro 5:3)</i></b>. Paul had his share of them<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 1:24; 2Co 2:4)</i></b> and so he understands how to sympathize<br>
 with the Thessalonians <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 3:3f.)</i></b>. They suffered after Paul<br>
 left Thessalonica <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 2:14)</i></b>. <B>{With joy of the Holy Spirit}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\meta charas pneumatos hagiou\)</i></b>. The Holy Spirit gives the joy<br>
 in the midst of the tribulations as Paul learned <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 5:3)</i></b>.<br>
 "This paradox of experience" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b> shines along the pathway<br>
 of martyrs and saints of Christ.<br>
 <br>
 1:7 <B>{So that ye became}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste genesthai humas\)</i></b>. Definite<br>
 result expressed by \h&#333;ste\ and the infinitive \genesthai\<br>
 <b><i>(second aorist middle of \ginomai\)</i></b> as is common in the _Koin&#275;_.<br>
 <B>{An ensample}</B> <b><i>(\tupon\)</i></b>. So B D, but Aleph A C have \tupous\<br>
 <b><i>(plural)</i></b>. The singular looks at the church as a whole, the plural<br>
 as individuals like \hum&#257;s\. \Tupos\ is an old word from \tupt&#333;\,<br>
 to strike, and so the mark of a blow, print as in John <!-#-->20:25.<br>
 Then the figure formed by the blow, image as in <!-#-->Ac 7:43. Then<br>
 the mould or form <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 6:17; Ac 23:25)</i></b>. Then an example or<br>
 pattern as in <!-#-->Ac 7:44, to be imitated as here, <!-#-->Php 3:17, etc.<br>
 It was a great compliment for the church in Thessalonica to be<br>
 already a model for believers in Macedonia and Achaia. Our word<br>
 _type_ for printers is this same word with one of its meanings.<br>
 Note separate article with both Macedonia <b><i>(\t&#275;i Makedoni&#257;i\)</i></b> and<br>
 Achaia <b><i>(\t&#275;i Achai&#257;i\)</i></b> treated as separate provinces as they<br>
 were.<br>
 <br>
 1:8 <B>{From you hath sounded forth}</B> <b><i>(\aph' hum&#333;n ex&#275;ch&#275;tai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Perfect passive indicative of \ex&#275;che&#333;\, late compound verb <b><i>(\ex,<br>
 &#275;chos, &#275;ch&#333;, &#275;ch&#275;\, our echo)</i></b> to sound out of a trumpet or of<br>
 thunder, to reverberate like our echo. Nowhere else in the N.T.<br>
 So "from you" as a sounding board or radio transmitting station<br>
 <b><i>(to use a modern figure)</i></b>. It marks forcibly "both the clear and<br>
 the persuasive nature of the \logos tou Kuriou\" <b><i>(Ellicott)</i></b>. This<br>
 phrase, the word of the Lord, may be subjective with the Lord as<br>
 its author or objective with the Lord as the object. It is both.<br>
 It is a graphic picture with a pardonable touch of hyperbole<br>
 <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b> for Thessalonica was a great commercial and political<br>
 centre for disseminating the news of salvation <b><i>(on the Egnation<br>
 Way)</i></b>. <B>{But in every place}</B> <b><i>(\all' en panti top&#333;i\)</i></b>. In contrast<br>
 to Macedonia and Achaia. The sentence would naturally stop here,<br>
 but Paul is dictating rapidly and earnestly and goes on. <B>{Your<br>
 faith to God-ward}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; pistis hum&#333;n h&#275; pros ton theon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, <B>{the faith of you that toward the God}</B>. The repeated<br>
 article makes clear that their faith is now directed toward the<br>
 true God and not toward the idols from which they had turned<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->10)</i></b>. <B>{Is gone forth}</B> <b><i>(\exel&#275;luthen\)</i></b>. Second perfect<br>
 active indicative of old verb \exerchomai\, to go out, state of<br>
 completion like \ex&#275;ch&#275;tai\ above. <B>{So that we need not to speak<br>
 anything}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste m&#275; chreian echein h&#275;m&#257;s lalein ti\)</i></b>. \H&#333;ste\<br>
 with the infinitive for actual result as in verse <!-#-->7. No vital<br>
 distinction between \lalein\ <b><i>(originally to chatter as of birds)</i></b><br>
 and \legein\, both being used in the _Koin&#275;_ for speaking and<br>
 preaching <b><i>(in the N.T.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:9 <B>{They themselves}</B> <b><i>(\autoi\)</i></b>. The men of Macedonia,<br>
 voluntarily. <B>{Report}</B> <b><i>(\apaggellousin\)</i></b>. Linear present active<br>
 indicative, keep on reporting. <B>{What manner of entering in}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hopoian eisodon\)</i></b>. What sort of entrance, qualitative relative<br>
 in an indirect question. <B>{We had}</B> <b><i>(\eschomen\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> indicative of the common verb \ech&#333;\. <B>{And<br>
 how}</B> <b><i>(\kai p&#333;s\)</i></b>. Here the interrogative adverb \p&#333;s\ in this<br>
 part of the indirect question. This part about "them" <b><i>(you)</i></b> as<br>
 the first part about Paul. The verb \epistreph&#333;\ is an old verb<br>
 for turning and is common in the Acts for Gentiles turning to<br>
 God, as here from idols, though not by Paul again in this sense.<br>
 In <!-#-->Ga 4:9 Paul uses it for turning to the weak and beggarly<br>
 elements of Judaism. <B>{From idols}</B> <b><i>(\apo t&#333;n eidol&#333;n\)</i></b>. Old word<br>
 from \eidos\ <b><i>(figure)</i></b> for image or likeness and then for the<br>
 image of a heathen god <b><i>(our _idol_)</i></b>. Common in the LXX in this<br>
 sense. In <!-#-->Ac 14:15 Paul at Lystra urged the people <B>{to turn<br>
 from these vain things to the living God}</B> <b><i>(\apo tout&#333;n t&#333;n<br>
 matai&#333;n epistrephein epi theon z&#333;nta\)</i></b>, using the same verb<br>
 \epistrephein\. Here also Paul has a like idea, <B>{to serve a<br>
 living and true God}</B> <b><i>(\douleuein the&#333;i z&#333;nti kai al&#275;thin&#333;i\)</i></b>. No<br>
 article, it is true, but should be translated "the living and<br>
 true God" <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ac 14:15)</i></b>. Not "dead" like the idols from which<br>
 they turned, but alive and genuine <b><i>(\al&#275;thinos\, not \al&#275;th&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:10 <B>{To wait for his Son from heaven}</B> <b><i>(\anamenein ton huion<br>
 autou ek t&#333;n ouran&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present infinitive, like \douleuein\, and<br>
 so linear, to keep on waiting for. The hope of the second coming<br>
 of Christ was real and powerful with Paul as it should be with<br>
 us. It was subject to abuse then as now as Paul will have to show<br>
 in this very letter. He alludes to this hope at the close of each<br>
 chapter in this Epistle. <B>{Whom he raised from the dead}</B> <b><i>(\hon<br>
 &#275;geiren ek [t&#333;n] nekr&#333;n\)</i></b>. Paul gloried in the fact of the<br>
 resurrection of Jesus from the dead of which fact he was himself<br>
 a personal witness. This fact is the foundation stone for all his<br>
 theology and it comes out in this first chapter. <B>{Jesus which<br>
 delivereth us from the wrath to come}</B> <b><i>(\I&#275;soun ton ruomenon h&#275;m&#257;s<br>
 ek t&#275;s org&#275;s t&#275;s erchomen&#275;s\)</i></b>. It is the historic, crucified,<br>
 risen, and ascended Jesus Christ, God's Son, who delivers from<br>
 the coming wrath. He is our Saviour <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 1:21)</i></b> true to his name<br>
 Jesus. He is our Rescuer <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 11:26, \ho ruomenos\, from <!-#-->Isa<br>
 59:20)</i></b>. It is eschatological language, this coming wrath of God<br>
 for sin <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 2:16; Ro 3:5; 5:9; 9:22; 13:5)</i></b>. It was Paul's<br>
 allusion to the day of judgment with Jesus as Judge whom God had<br>
 raised from the dead that made the Athenians mock and leave him<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 17:31f.)</i></b>. But Paul did not change his belief or his<br>
 preaching because of the conduct of the Athenians. He is certain<br>
 that God's wrath in due time will punish sin. Surely this is a<br>
 needed lesson for our day. It was coming then and it is coming<br>
 now.<br>
