<p>24:1 <B>{And with an Orator, one Tertullus}</B> <b><i>(\kai rh&#275;toros Tertullou<br>
 tinos\)</i></b>. A deputation of elders along with the high priest<br>
 Ananias, not the whole Sanhedrin, but no hint of the forty<br>
 conspirators or of the Asian Jews. The Sanhedrin had become<br>
 divided so that now it is probably Ananias <b><i>(mortally offended)</i></b><br>
 and the Sadducees who take the lead in the prosecution of Paul.<br>
 It is not clear whether after five days is from Paul's departure<br>
 from Jerusalem or his arrival in Caesarea. If he spent nine days<br>
 in Jerusalem, then the five days would be counted from then<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->11)</i></b>. The employment of a Roman lawyer <b><i>(Latin _orator_)</i></b><br>
 was necessary since the Jews were not familiar with Roman legal<br>
 procedure and it was the custom in the provinces <b><i>(Cicero _pro<br>
 Cael_. 30)</i></b>. The speech was probably in Latin which Paul may have<br>
 understood also. \Rh&#275;t&#333;r\ is a common old Greek word meaning a<br>
 forensic orator or advocate but here only in the N.T. The Latin<br>
 _rhetor_ was a teacher of rhetoric, a very different thing.<br>
 Tertullus is a diminutive of Tertius <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 16:22)</i></b>. <B>{Informed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\enephanisan\)</i></b>. Same verb as in <!-#-->23:15,22, somewhat like our<br>
 modern "indictment," certainly accusations "against Paul" <b><i>(\kata<br>
 tou Paulou\)</i></b>. They were down on Paul and the hired barrister was<br>
 prosecuting attorney. For the legal form see _Oxyrhynchus<br>
 Papyri_, Vol. II., p. 162, line 19.<br>
 <br>
 24:2 <B>{When he <b><i>(Paul)</i></b> was called}</B> <b><i>(\kl&#275;thentos autou\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute <b><i>(as so often in Acts)</i></b> with first aorist passive<br>
 participle of \kale&#333;\. Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace<br>
 <b><i>(\poll&#275;s eir&#275;n&#275;s tugchanontes dia sou\)</i></b>. Literally, obtaining<br>
 much peace by thee. A regular piece of flattery, _captatio<br>
 benevolentiae_, to ingratiate himself into the good graces of the<br>
 governor. Felix had suppressed a riot, but Tacitus <b><i>(_Ann_. XII.<br>
 54)</i></b> declares that Felix secretly encouraged banditti and shared<br>
 the plunder for which the Jews finally made complaint to Nero who<br>
 recalled him. But it sounded well to praise Felix for keeping<br>
 peace in his province, especially as Tertullus was going to<br>
 accuse Paul of being a disturber of the peace. <B>{And that by thy<br>
 providence}</B> <b><i>(\kai dia t&#275;s pronoias\)</i></b>. Forethought, old Greek word<br>
 from \pronoos\ <b><i>(\pronoe&#333;\ in <!-#-->1Ti 5:8; Ro 12:17; 2Co 8:21)</i></b>, in<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ro 13:14. "Providence" is Latin<br>
 _Providentia_ <b><i>(foreseeing, _provideo_)</i></b>. Roman coins often have<br>
 _Providentia Caesaris_. Post-Augustan Latin uses it of God<br>
 <b><i>(Deus)</i></b>. <B>{Evils are corrected for this nation}</B> <b><i>(\diorth&#333;mat&#333;n<br>
 ginomen&#333;n t&#333;i ethnei tout&#333;i\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again,<br>
 \ginomen&#333;n\, present middle participle describing the process of<br>
 reform going on for this nation <b><i>(dative case of personal<br>
 interest)</i></b>. \Diorth&#333;ma\ <b><i>(from \diortho&#333;\, to set right)</i></b> occurs<br>
 from Aristotle on of setting right broken limbs <b><i>(Hippocrates)</i></b> or<br>
 reforms in law and life <b><i>(Polybius, Plutarch)</i></b>. "Reform continually<br>
 taking place for this nation." Felix the Reform Governor of<br>
 Judea! It is like a campaign speech, but it doubtless pleased<br>
 Felix.<br>
 <br>
 24:3 <B>{In all ways and in all places}</B> <b><i>(\pant&#275;i te kai pantachou\)</i></b>.<br>
 \Pant&#275;i\, old adverb of manner only here in N.T. \Pantachou\ also<br>
 old adverb of place, several times in N.T. But these adverbs most<br>
 likely go with the preceding clause about "reforms" rather than<br>
 as here translated with "we accept" <b><i>(\apodechometha\)</i></b>. But "with<br>
 all gratitude" <b><i>(\meta pas&#275;s eucharistias\)</i></b> does naturally go with<br>
 \apodechometha\.<br>
 <br>
 24:4 <B>{That I be not further tedious unto thee}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275; epi<br>
 pleion se enkopt&#333;\)</i></b>. _Koin&#275;_ verb <b><i>(Hippocrates, Polybius)</i></b> to cut<br>
 in on <b><i>(or into)</i></b>, to cut off, to impede, to hinder. Our modern<br>
 telephone and radio illustrate it well. In the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 24:4;<br>
 1Th 2:18; Ga 5:7; Ro 15:22; 1Pe 3:7)</i></b>. "That I may not cut in on<br>
 or interrupt thee further <b><i>(\epi pleion\)</i></b> in thy reforms."<br>
 Flattery still. <B>{Of thy clemency}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i s&#275;i epieikei&#257;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Instrumental case of old word from \epieik&#275;s\ and this from \epi\<br>
 and \eikos\ <b><i>(reasonable, likely, fair)</i></b>. "Sweet Reasonableness"<br>
 <b><i>(Matthew Arnold)</i></b>, gentleness, fairness. An \epieik&#275;s\ man is "one<br>
 who makes reasonable concessions" <b><i>(Aristotle, _Eth_. V. 10)</i></b>,<br>
 while \dikaios\ is "one who insists on his full rights" <b><i>(Plato,<br>
 _Leg_. 757 D)</i></b> as translated by Page. <B>{A few words}</B> <b><i>(\suntom&#333;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Old adverb from \suntemn&#333;\, to cut together <b><i>(short)</i></b>, abbreviate.<br>
 Like \dia brache&#333;n\ in <!-#-->Heb 13:22. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mr 16<br>
 <b><i>(shorter conclusion)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:5 <B>{For we have found}</B> <b><i>(\heurontes gar\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \heurisk&#333;\, but without a principal verb in the<br>
 sentence. Probably we have here only a "summary of the charges<br>
 against Paul" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. <B>{A pestilent fellow}</B> <b><i>(\loimon\)</i></b>. An old<br>
 word for pest, plague, pestilence, Paul the pest. In N.T. only<br>
 here and <!-#-->Lu 21:11 <b><i>(\loimoi kai limoi\, pestilences and famines)</i></b><br>
 which see. Latin _pestis_. Think of the greatest preacher of the<br>
 ages being branded a pest by a contemporary hired lawyer. <B>{A<br>
 mover of insurrections}</B> <b><i>(\kinounta staseis\)</i></b>. This was an offence<br>
 against Roman law if it could be proven. "Plotted against at<br>
 Damascus, plotted against at Jerusalem, expelled from Pisidian<br>
 Antioch, stoned at Lystra, scourged and imprisoned at Philippi,<br>
 accused of treason at Thessalonica, haled before the proconsul at<br>
 Corinth, cause of a serious riot at Ephesus, and now finally of a<br>
 riot at Jerusalem" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. Specious proof could have been<br>
 produced, but was not. Tertullus went on to other charges with<br>
 which a Roman court had no concern <b><i>(instance Gallio in Corinth)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Throughout the world}</B> <b><i>(\kata t&#275;n oikoumen&#275;n\)</i></b>. The Roman<br>
 inhabited earth <b><i>(\g&#275;n\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->17:6. <B>{A ringleader of the sect<br>
 of the Nazarenes}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;tostat&#275;n t&#275;s t&#333;n Naz&#333;rai&#333;n hairese&#333;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 \Pr&#333;tostat&#275;s\ is an old word in common use from \pr&#333;tos\ and<br>
 \hist&#275;mi\, a front-rank man, a chief, a champion. Here only in<br>
 the N.T. This charge is certainly true. About "sect" <b><i>(\hairesis\)</i></b><br>
 see on &#175;5:17. \Naz&#333;raioi\ here only in the plural in the N.T.,<br>
 elsewhere of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 2:23; 26:71; Lu 18:37; Joh 18:5,7; 19:19;<br>
 Ac 2:22; 3:6; 4:10; 6:14; 22:8; 26:9)</i></b>. The disciple is not above<br>
 his Master. There was a sneer in the term as applied to Jesus and<br>
 here to his followers.<br>
 <br>
 24:6 <B>{Assayed to profane}</B> <b><i>(\epeirasen beb&#275;l&#333;sai\)</i></b>. A flat<br>
 untruth, but the charge of the Asian Jews <b><i>(<!-#-->21:28-30)</i></b>. _Verbum<br>
 optum ad calumnian_ <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>. <B>{We seized}</B> <b><i>(\ekrat&#275;samen\)</i></b>. As if<br>
 the Sanhedrin had arrested Paul, Tertullus identifying himself<br>
 with his clients. But it was the mob <b><i>(<!-#-->21:28-31)</i></b> that attacked<br>
 Paul and Lysias who rescued him <b><i>(<!-#-->21:32ff.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:7 This whole verse with some words at the end of verse <!-#-->6 and<br>
 the beginning of verse <!-#-->8 in the Textus Receptus <b><i>("And would<br>
 have judged according to our law. But the chief captain Lysias<br>
 came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our<br>
 hands, commanding his accusers to come unto thee")</i></b> is absent from<br>
 Aleph A B H L P 61 <b><i>(many other cursives)</i></b> Sahidic Bohairic. It is<br>
 beyond doubt a later addition to the incomplete report of the<br>
 speech of Tertullus. As the Revised Version stands, verse <!-#-->8<br>
 connects with verse <!-#-->6. The motive of the added words is clearly<br>
 to prejudice Felix against Lysias and they contradict the record<br>
 in <!-#-->Ac 21. Furneaux holds them to be genuine and omitted because<br>
 contradictory to <!-#-->Ac 21. More likely they are a clumsy attempt<br>
 to complete the speech of Tertullus.<br>
 <br>
 24:8 <B>{From whom}</B> <b><i>(\par' hou\)</i></b>. Referring to Paul, but in the<br>
 Textus Receptus referring to Lysias. <B>{By examining him thyself}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\autos anakrinas\)</i></b>. Not by torture, since Paul was a Roman<br>
 citizen, but by hearing what Paul has to say in defence of<br>
 himself. \Anakrin&#333;\ is to examine thoroughly up and down as in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 23:14.<br>
 <br>
 24:9 <B>{Joined in the charge}</B> <b><i>(\sunepethento\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 middle indicative of \sunepitith&#275;mi\, old verb, double compound,<br>
 to place upon <b><i>(\epi\)</i></b> together with <b><i>(\sun\)</i></b>, to make a joint<br>
 attack, here only in the N.T. <B>{Affirming}</B> <b><i>(\phaskontes\)</i></b>.<br>
 Alleging, with the accusative in indirect assertion as in <!-#-->25:19;<br>
 Ro 1:22 <b><i>(nominative with infinitive, Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 1038)</i></b>. <B>{Were so}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s echein\)</i></b>, "held thus," common idiom.<br>
 <br>
 24:10 <B>{When the governor had beckoned to him}</B> <b><i>(\neusantos aut&#333;i<br>
 tou h&#275;gemonos\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again with first aorist active<br>
 participle of \neu&#333;\, to give a nod, old word, in N.T. only here<br>
 and <!-#-->Joh 13:24. "The governor nodding to him." <B>{Forasmuch as I<br>
 know}</B> <b><i>(\epistamenos\)</i></b>. Knowing, from \epistamai\. <B>{That thou hast<br>
 been of many years a judge}</B> <b><i>(\ek poll&#333;n et&#333;n onta se krit&#275;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 The participle in indirect assertion after \epistamenos\<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1041)</i></b>. Paul goes as far as he can in<br>
 the way of a compliment. For seven years Felix has been governor,<br>
 \onta\ being a sort of progressive present participle with \ek<br>
 poll&#333;n et&#333;n\ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 892)</i></b>. <B>{Cheerfully}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\euthum&#333;s\)</i></b>. Old adverb from \euthumos\ <b><i>(\eu\ and \thumos\, good<br>
 spirit)</i></b>, here only in N.T. <B>{Make my defence}</B> <b><i>(\apologoumai\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 and regular word for this idea as in <!-#-->Lu 21:14 which see.<br>
 <br>
 24:11 <B>{Seeing that thou canst take knowledge}</B> <b><i>(\dunamenou sou<br>
 epign&#333;nai\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again. The same word and form<br>
 <b><i>(\epign&#333;nai\)</i></b> used by Tertullus, if in Greek, in verse <!-#-->8 to<br>
 Felix. Paul takes it up and repeats it. <B>{Not more than twelve<br>
 days}</B> <b><i>(\ou pleious h&#275;merai d&#333;deka\)</i></b>. Here \&#275;\ <b><i>(than)</i></b> is absent<br>
 without change of case to the ablative as usually happens. But<br>
 this idiom is found in the _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 666)</i></b>. <B>{Since}</B> <b><i>(\aph' h&#275;s\)</i></b>. Supply \h&#275;meras\, "from which day."<br>
 <B>{To worship}</B> <b><i>(\proskun&#275;s&#333;n\)</i></b>. One of the few examples of the<br>
 future participle of purpose so common in the old Attic.<br>
 <br>
 24:12 <B>{Disputing}</B> <b><i>(\dialegomenon\)</i></b>. Simply conversing,<br>
 discussing, arguing, and then disputing, common verb in old Greek<br>
 and in N.T. <b><i>(especially in Acts)</i></b>. <B>{Stirring up a crowd}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epistasin poiounta ochlou\)</i></b>. \Epistasis\ is a late word from<br>
 \ephist&#275;mi\, to make an onset or rush. Only twice in the N.T.,<br>
 <!-#-->2Co 11:28 <b><i>(the pressure or care of the churches)</i></b> and here<br>
 <b><i>(making a rush of a crowd)</i></b>. The papyri give examples also for<br>
 "onset." So Paul denies the two charges that were serious and the<br>
 only one that concerned Roman law <b><i>(insurrection)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:13 <B>{Prove}</B> <b><i>(\parast&#275;sai\)</i></b>. First aorist active infinitive of<br>
 \parist&#275;mi\, to place beside. They have made "charges," mere<br>
 assertions. They have not backed up these charges with proof,<br>
 "nor can they," says Paul. <B>{Now}</B> <b><i>(\nuni\)</i></b>. As if they had changed<br>
 their charges from the cries of the mob in Jerusalem which is<br>
 true. Paul has no hired lawyer to plead for him, but he has made<br>
 a masterly plea for his freedom.<br>
 <br>
 24:14 <B>{I confess}</B> <b><i>(\homolog&#333;\)</i></b>. The only charge left was that of<br>
 being a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. This Paul<br>
 frankly confesses is true. He uses the word in its full sense. He<br>
 is "guilty" of that. <B>{After the Way}</B> <b><i>(\kata t&#275;n hodon\)</i></b>. This<br>
 word Paul had already applied to Christianity <b><i>(<!-#-->22:4)</i></b>. He<br>
 prefers it to "sect" <b><i>(\hairesin\ which means a choosing, then a<br>
 division)</i></b>. Paul claims Christianity to be the real <b><i>(whole,<br>
 catholic)</i></b> Judaism, not a "sect" of it. But he will show that<br>
 Christianity is not a deviation from Judaism, but the fulfilment<br>
 of it <b><i>(Page)</i></b> as he has already shown in <!-#-->Ga 3; Ro 9. <B>{So serve I<br>
 the God of our fathers}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s latreu&#333; t&#333;i patr&#333;i&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul has not stretched the truth at all. He has confirmed the<br>
 claim made before the Sanhedrin that he is a spiritual Pharisee<br>
 in the truest sense <b><i>(<!-#-->23:6)</i></b>. He reasserts his faith in all the<br>
 law and the prophets, holding to the Messianic hope. A curious<br>
 "heretic" surely! <B>{Which these themselves also look for}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;n<br>
 kai autoi houtoi prosdechontai\)</i></b>. Probably with a gesture towards<br>
 his accusers. He does not treat them all as Sadducees. See <!-#-->Tit<br>
 2:13 for similar use of the verb <b><i>(\prosdechomenoi t&#275;n makarian<br>
 elpida\, looking for the happy hope)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:15 <B>{That there shall be a resurrection}</B> <b><i>(\anastasin mellein<br>
 esesthai\)</i></b>. Indirect assertion with infinitive and accusative of<br>
 general reference <b><i>(\anastasin\)</i></b> after the word \elpida\ <b><i>(hope)</i></b>.<br>
 The future infinitive \esesthai\ after \mellein\ is also<br>
 according to rule, \mell&#333;\ being followed by either present,<br>
 aorist, or future infinitive <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 870, 877,<br>
 878)</i></b>. <B>{Both of the just and the unjust}</B> <b><i>(\dikai&#333;n te kai<br>
 adik&#333;n\)</i></b>. Apparently at the same time as in <!-#-->Joh 5:29 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ac<br>
 17:31f.)</i></b>. Gardner thinks that Luke here misrepresents Paul who<br>
 held to no resurrection save for those "in Christ," a mistaken<br>
 interpretation of Paul in my opinion. The Talmud teaches the<br>
 resurrection of Israelites only, but Paul was more than a<br>
 Pharisee.<br>
 <br>
 24:16 <B>{Herein}</B> <b><i>(\en tout&#333;i\)</i></b>. His whole confession of belief in<br>
 verses <!-#-->14,15. <B>{Do I also exercise myself}</B> <b><i>(\kai autos ask&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 "Do I also myself take exercise," take pains, labour, strive. Old<br>
 word in Homer to work as raw materials, to adorn by art, then to<br>
 drill. Our word ascetic comes from this root, one who seeks to<br>
 gain piety by rules and severe hardship. Paul claims to be equal<br>
 to his accusers in efforts to please God. <B>{Void of offence}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aproskopon\)</i></b>. This word belongs to the papyri and N.T. <b><i>(only in<br>
 Paul)</i></b>, not in the ancient writers. The papyri examples <b><i>(Moulton<br>
 Milligan, _Vocabulary_)</i></b> use the word to mean "free from hurt or<br>
 harm." It is a privative and \proskopt&#333;\ <b><i>(to cut or stumble<br>
 against)</i></b>. Page likes "void of offence" since that can be either<br>
 active "not stumbling" as in <!-#-->Php 1:10 or passive "not stumbled<br>
 against" as in <!-#-->1Co 10:32 <b><i>(the first toward God and the second<br>
 toward men)</i></b>, the only other N.T. examples. Hence the word here<br>
 appears in both senses <b><i>(the first towards God, the second towards<br>
 men)</i></b>. Paul adds "alway" <b><i>(\dia pantos\)</i></b>, a bold claim for a<br>
 consistent aim in life. "Certainly his conscience acquitted him<br>
 of having caused any offence to his countrymen" <b><i>(Rackham)</i></b>.<br>
 Furneaux thinks that it must have been wormwood and gall to<br>
 Ananias to hear Paul repeat here the same words because of which<br>
 he had ordered Paul to be smitten on the mouth <b><i>(<!-#-->23:1f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:17 <B>{After many years}</B> <b><i>(\di' et&#333;n pleion&#333;n\)</i></b>. "At an interval<br>
 <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> of more <b><i>(\pleion&#333;n\)</i></b> years" <b><i>(than a few, one must add)</i></b>,<br>
 not "after many years." If, as is likely Paul went up to<br>
 Jerusalem in <!-#-->Ac 18:22, that was some five years ago and would<br>
 justify "\pleion&#333;n\" <b><i>(several years ago or some years ago)</i></b>. <B>{To<br>
 bring alms}</B> <b><i>(\ele&#275;mosunas poi&#275;son\)</i></b>. Another <b><i>(see \proskun&#275;s&#333;n\<br>
 in verse <!-#-->11)</i></b> example of the future participle of purpose in the<br>
 N.T. These "alms" <b><i>(on \ele&#275;mosunas\ see on &#175;Mt 6:1,4; Ac 10:2,<br>
 common in Tobit and is in the papyri)</i></b> were for the poor saints in<br>
 Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 16:1-4; 2Co 8; 9; Ro 15:26)</i></b> who were none the<br>
 less Jews. "And offerings" <b><i>(\kai prosphoras\)</i></b>. The very word used<br>
 in <!-#-->21:26 of the offerings or sacrifices made by Paul for the<br>
 four brethren and himself. It does not follow that it was Paul's<br>
 original purpose to make these "offerings" before he came to<br>
 Jerusalem <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->18:18)</i></b>. He came up to worship <b><i>(verse <!-#-->11)</i></b> and<br>
 to be present at Pentecost <b><i>(<!-#-->20:16)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:18 <B>{Amidst which}</B> <b><i>(\en hail\)</i></b>. That is, "in which offerings"<br>
 <b><i>(in presenting which offerings, <!-#-->21:27)</i></b>. <B>{They found me}</B> <b><i>(my<br>
 accusers here present, \heuron me\)</i></b>, <B>{purified in the temple}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\h&#275;gnismenon en t&#333;i hier&#333;i\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of<br>
 \hagniz&#333;\ <b><i>(same verb in <!-#-->21:24,26)</i></b> state of completion of the<br>
 Jewish sacrifices which had gone on for seven days <b><i>(<!-#-->21:27)</i></b>, the<br>
 very opposite of the charges made. <B>{With no crowd}</B> <b><i>(\ou meta<br>
 ochlou\)</i></b>. "Not with a crowd" till the Asiatic Jews gathered one<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->21:27)</i></b>. <B>{Nor yet with tumult}</B> <b><i>(\oude meta thorubou\)</i></b>. They<br>
 made the tumult <b><i>(<!-#-->27:30)</i></b>, not Paul. Till they made the stir, all<br>
 was quiet.<br>
 <br>
 24:19 <B>{But certain Jews from Asia}</B> <b><i>(\tines de apo t&#275;s Alias<br>
 Ioudaioi\)</i></b>. No verb appears in the Greek for these words. Perhaps<br>
 he meant to say that "certain Jews from Asia charged me with<br>
 doing these things." Instead of saying that, Paul stops to<br>
 explain that they are not here, a thoroughly Pauline anacoluthon<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 7:5)</i></b> as in <!-#-->26:9. "The passage as it stands is instinct<br>
 with life, and seems to exhibit the abruptness so characteristic<br>
 of the Pauline Epistles" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. <B>{Who ought to have been here<br>
 before thee}</B> <b><i>(\hous edei epi sou pareinai\)</i></b>. This use of \epi\<br>
 with genitive of the person is common. The imperfect indicative<br>
 with verbs of necessity and obligation to express failure to live<br>
 up to it is common in Greek <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 919-21)</i></b>.<br>
 "The accusers who were present had not witnessed the alleged<br>
 offence: those who could have given evidence at first-hand were<br>
 not present" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. There was no case in a Roman court.<br>
 These Asiatic Jews are never heard of after the riot, though they<br>
 almost succeeded in killing Paul then. <B>{If they had aught against<br>
 me}</B> <b><i>(\ei ti echoien pros eme\)</i></b>. A condition of the fourth class<br>
 or undetermined with less likelihood of being determined <b><i>(\ei\<br>
 with the optative, Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1021)</i></b>. This is a<br>
 "mixed condition" <b><i>(_op.cit._, p. 1022)</i></b> with a conclusion of the<br>
 second class.<br>
 <br>
 24:20 <B>{These men themselves}</B> <b><i>(\autoi houtoi\)</i></b>. Since the Asiatic<br>
 Jews are not present and these men are. <B>{Wrong doing}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\adik&#275;ma\)</i></b>. Or misdeed. Old word from \adike&#333;\, to do wrong. In<br>
 the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ac 18:14; Re 18:5. Paul uses "\adik&#275;ma\"<br>

 <br>
 24:22 <B>{Having more exact knowledge}</B> <b><i>(\akribesteron eid&#333;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 "Knowing" <b><i>(second perfect active participle of \oida\)</i></b> "more<br>
 accurately" <b><i>(comparative of adverb \akrib&#333;s\)</i></b>. More accurately<br>
 than what? Than the Sanhedrin supposed he had "concerning the<br>
 Way" <b><i>(\ta peri t&#275;s hodou\, the things concerning the Way, common<br>
 in Acts for Christianity)</i></b>. How Felix had gained this knowledge of<br>
 Christianity is not stated. Philip the Evangelist lived here in<br>
 Caesarea and there was a church also. Drusilla was a Jewess and<br>
 may have told him something. Besides, it is wholly possible that<br>
 Felix knew of the decision of Gallio in Corinth that Christianity<br>
 was a _religio licita_ as a form of Judaism. As a Roman official<br>
 he knew perfectly well that the Sanhedrin with the help of<br>
 Tertullus had failed utterly to make out a case against Paul. He<br>
 could have released Paul and probably would have done so but for<br>
 fear of offending the Jews whose ruler he was and the hope that<br>
 Paul <b><i>(note "alms" in verse <!-#-->17)</i></b> might offer him bribes for his<br>
 liberty. <B>{Deferred them}</B> <b><i>(\anebaleto autous\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 middle indicative of \anaball&#333;\, old verb <b><i>(only here in N.T.)</i></b> to<br>
 throw or toss up, to put back or off, in middle to put off from<br>
 one, to delay, to adjourn. Felix adjourned the case without a<br>
 decision under a plausible pretext, that he required the presence<br>
 of Lysias in person, which was not the case. Lysias had already<br>
 said that Paul was innocent and was never summoned to Caesarea,<br>
 so far as we know. Since Paul was a Roman citizen, Lysias could<br>
 have thrown some light on the riot, if he had any. <B>{Shall come<br>
 down}</B> <b><i>(\katab&#275;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist active subjunctive of<br>
 \katabain&#333;\. <B>{I will determine your matter}</B> <b><i>(\diagn&#333;somai ta<br>

 Joh 1:11)</i></b> or intimates. Of these we know the names of Luke,<br>
 Aristarchus, Trophimus, Philip the Evangelist.<br>
 <br>
 24:24 <B>{With Drusilla his wife}</B> <b><i>(\sun Drousill&#275;i t&#275;i idi&#257;i<br>
 gunaiki\)</i></b>. Felix had induced her to leave her former husband<br>
 Aziz, King of Emesa. She was one of three daughters of Herod<br>
 Agrippa I <b><i>(Drusilla, Mariamne, Bernice)</i></b>. Her father murdered<br>
 James, her great-uncle Herod Antipas slew John the Baptist, her<br>
 great-grandfather <b><i>(Herod the Great)</i></b> killed the babes of<br>
 Bethlehem. Perhaps the mention of Drusilla as "his own wife" is<br>
 to show that it was not a formal trial on this occasion. Page<br>
 thinks that she was responsible for the interview because of her<br>
 curiosity to hear Paul. <B>{Sent for}</B> <b><i>(\metepempsato\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 middle of \metapemp&#333;\ as usual <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10:5)</i></b>.<br>

 24:25 <B>{Was terrified}</B> <b><i>(\emphobos genomenos\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist<br>
 middle of \ginomai\, "becoming terrified." \Emphobos\ <b><i>(\en\ and<br>
 \phobos\)</i></b> old word, in the N.T. only <!-#-->Lu 24:5; Ac 10:5; 24:25; Re<br>
 11:13. Paul turned the tables completely around and expounded<br>
 "the faith in Christ Jesus" as it applied to Felix and Drusilla<br>
 and discoursed <b><i>(\dialegomenou autou\, genitive absolute)</i></b><br>
 concerning "righteousness" <b><i>(\dikaiosun&#275;s\)</i></b> which they did not<br>
 possess, "self-control" or temperance <b><i>(\egkrateias\)</i></b> which they<br>
 did not exhibit, and "the judgment to come" <b><i>(\tou krimatos tou<br>
 mellontos\)</i></b> which was certain to overtake them. Felix was brought<br>
 under conviction, but apparently not Drusilla. Like another<br>
 Herodias her resentment was to be feared <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. <B>{Go thy way<br>
 for this time}</B> <b><i>(\to nun echon poreuou\)</i></b>. The ancient Greek has<br>
 this use of \to nun echon\ <b><i>(Tobit 7:11)</i></b> in the accusative of<br>
 time, "as for the present or holding the now." <B>{When I have a<br>
 convenient season}</B> <b><i>(\kairon metalab&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of the old verb \metalamban&#333;\, to find a share in, to<br>
 obtain. It was his "excuse" for dodging the personal turn that<br>
 Paul had given.<br>
 <br>
 24:26 <B>{He hoped withal}</B> <b><i>(\hama kai elpiz&#333;n\)</i></b>. "At the same time<br>
 also hoping." Paul had mentioned the "alms" <b><i>(<!-#-->24:17)</i></b> and that<br>
 excited the avarice of Felix for "money" <b><i>(\chr&#275;mata\)</i></b>. Roman law<br>
 demanded exile and confiscation for a magistrate who accepted<br>
 bribes, but it was lax in the provinces. Felix had doubtless<br>
 received them before. Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. XX. 8, 9)</i></b> represents Felix<br>
 as greedy for money. <B>{The oftener}</B> <b><i>(\puknoteron\)</i></b>. Comparative<br>
 adverb of \puknos\, old word, in N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 5:33<br>
 which see and <!-#-->1Ti 5:23. Kin to \pugm&#275;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 7:3)</i></b> which see<br>
 from \puk&#333;\, thick, dense, compact. Paul kept on not offering a<br>
 bribe, but Felix continued to have hopes <b><i>(present tense<br>
 \elpiz&#333;n\)</i></b>, kept on sending for him <b><i>(present tense<br>
 \metapempomenos\)</i></b>, and kept on communing <b><i>(imperfect active<br>
 \h&#333;milei\ from \homile&#333;\, old word as in <!-#-->Ac 20:11; Lu 24:14,<br>

 disappointment. He was never terrified again.<br>
 <br>
 24:27 <B>{But when two years were fulfilled}</B> <b><i>(\dietias de<br>
 pl&#275;r&#333;theis&#275;s\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute first aorist passive of<br>
 \pl&#275;ro&#333;\, common verb to fill full. \Dietia\, late word in LXX<br>
 and Philo, common in the papyri, in N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ac<br>
 28:30. Compound of \dia\, two <b><i>(\duo, dis\)</i></b> and \etos\, year. So<br>
 Paul lingered on in prison in Caesarea, waiting for the second<br>
 hearing under Felix which never came. Caesarea now became the<br>
 compulsory headquarters of Paul for two years. With all his<br>
 travels Paul spent several years each at Tarsus, Antioch,<br>
 Corinth, Ephesus, though not as a prisoner unless that was true<br>
 part of the time at Ephesus for which there is some evidence<br>
 though not of a convincing kind. We do not know that Luke<br>
 remained in Caesarea all this time. In all probability he came<br>
 and went with frequent visits with Philip the Evangelist. It was<br>
 probably during this period that Luke secured the material for<br>
 his Gospel and wrote part or all of it before going to Rome. He<br>
 had ample opportunity to examine the eyewitnesses who heard Jesus<br>
 and the first attempts at writing including the Gospel of Mark<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:1-4)</i></b>. <B>{Was succeeded by}</B> <b><i>(\elaben diadochon\)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 "received as successor." \Diadochos\ is an old word from<br>
 \diadechomai\, to receive in succession <b><i>(\dia, duo\, two)</i></b> and<br>
 occurs here alone in the N.T. Deissmann <b><i>(_Bible Studies_, p. 115)</i></b><br>
 gives papyri examples where \hoi diadochoi\ means "higher<br>
 officials at the court of the Ptolemies," probably "deputies," a<br>
 usage growing out of the "successors" of Alexander the Great<br>
 <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan's _Vocabulary_)</i></b>, though here the original<br>
 notion of "successor" occurs <b><i>(cf. Josephus, _Ant_. XX. 8, 9)</i></b>.<br>
 Luke does not tell why Felix "received" a successor. The<br>
 explanation is that during these two years the Jews and the<br>
 Gentiles had an open fight in the market-place in Caesarea. Felix<br>
 put the soldiers on the mob and many Jews were killed. The Jews<br>
 made formal complaint to the Emperor with the result that Felix<br>
 was recalled and Porcius Festus sent in his stead. <B>{Porcius<br>
 Festus}</B> <b><i>(\Porkion Ph&#275;ston\)</i></b>. We know very little about this man.<br>
 He is usually considered a worthier man than Felix, but Paul<br>
 fared no better at his hands and he exhibits the same insincerity<br>
 and eagerness to please the Jews. Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. XX. 8, 9)</i></b> says<br>
 that "Porcius Festus was sent as a successor to Felix." The<br>
 precise year when this change occurred is not clear. Albinus<br>
 succeeded Festus by A.D. 62, so that it is probable that Festus<br>
 came A.D. 58 <b><i>(or 59)</i></b>. Death cut short his career in a couple of<br>
 years though he did more than Felix to rid the country of robbers<br>
 and _sicarii_. Some scholars argue for an earlier date for the<br>
 recall of Felix. Nero became Emperor Oct. 13, A.D. 54. Poppaea,<br>
 his Jewish mistress and finally wife, may have had something to<br>
 do with the recall of Felix at the request of the Jews. <B>{Desiring<br>
 to gain favour with the Jews}</B> <b><i>(\thel&#333;n te charita katathesthai<br>
 tois Ioudaiois\)</i></b>. Reason for his conduct. Note second aorist<br>
 <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> middle infinitive \katathesthai\ from \katatith&#275;mi\,<br>
 old verb to place down, to make a deposit, to deposit a favour<br>
 with, to do something to win favour. Only here and <!-#-->25:9 in<br>
 N.T., though in some MSS. in <!-#-->Mr 15:46. It is a banking figure.<br>
 <B>{Left Paul in bonds}</B> <b><i>(\katelipe ton Paulon dedemenon\)</i></b>. Effective<br>
 aorist active indicative of \kataleip&#333;\, to leave behind. Paul<br>
 "in bonds" <b><i>(\dedemenon\, perfect passive participle of \de&#333;\, to<br>
 bind)</i></b> was the "deposit" <b><i>(\katathesthai\)</i></b> for their favour. Codex<br>
 Bezae adds that Felix left Paul in custody "because of Drusilla"<br>
 <b><i>(\dia Drousillan\)</i></b>. She disliked Paul as much as Herodias did<br>
 John the Baptist. So Pilate surrendered to the Jews about the<br>
 death of Jesus when they threatened to report him to Caesar. Some<br>
 critics would date the third group of Paul's Epistles<br>
 <b><i>(Philippians, Philemon, Colossians, Ephesians)</i></b> to the<br>
 imprisonment here in Caesarea, some even to one in Ephesus. But<br>
 the arguments for either of these two views are more specious<br>
 than convincing. Furneaux would even put <!-#-->2Ti 4:9-22 here in<br>
 spite of the flat contradiction with <!-#-->Ac 21:29 about Trophimus<br>
 being in Jerusalem instead of Miletus <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 4:20)</i></b>, a "mistake"<br>
 which he attributes to Luke! That sort of criticism can prove<br>
 anything.<br>
