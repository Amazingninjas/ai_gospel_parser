<p>12:1 <B>{In the meantime}</B> <b><i>(\en hois\)</i></b>. It is a classic idiom to<br>
 start a sentence or even a paragraph as here with a relative, "in<br>
 which things or circumstances," without any expressed antecedent<br>
 other than the incidents in <!-#-->11:53f. In <!-#-->12:3 Luke actually<br>
 begins the sentence with two relatives \anth' h&#333;n hosa\<br>
 <b><i>(wherefore whatsoever)</i></b>. <B>{Many thousands}</B> <b><i>(\muriad&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute with \episunachtheis&#333;n\ <b><i>(first aorist passive participle<br>
 feminine plural because of \muriad&#333;n\)</i></b>, a double compound late<br>
 verb, \episunag&#333;\, to gather together unto. The word "myriads" is<br>
 probably hyperbolical as in <!-#-->Ac 21:20, but in the sense of ten<br>
 thousand, as in <!-#-->Ac 19:19, it means a very large crowd<br>
 apparently drawn together by the violent attacks of the rabbis<br>
 against Jesus. <B>{Insomuch that they trode one upon another}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\h&#333;ste katapatein all&#275;lous\)</i></b>. The imagination must complete the<br>
 picture of this jam. <B>{Unto his disciples first of all}</B> <b><i>(\pros<br>
 tous math&#275;tas autou pr&#333;ton\)</i></b>. This long discourse in <!-#-->Lu 12 is<br>
 really a series of separate talks to various groups in the vast<br>
 crowds around Jesus. This particular talk goes through verse<br>
 <!-#-->12. <B>{Beware of}</B> <b><i>(\prosechete heautois apo\)</i></b>. Put your mind<br>
 <b><i>(\noun\ understood)</i></b> for yourselves <b><i>(dative)</i></b> and avoid <b><i>(\apo\ with<br>
 the ablative)</i></b>. <B>{The leaven of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\t&#275;s zum&#275;s h&#275;tis estin hupocrisis t&#333;n Pharisai&#333;n\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Mr 8:15<br>
 Jesus had coupled the lesson of the Pharisees with that of Herod,<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 16:6 with that of the Sadducees also. He had long ago<br>
 called the Pharisees hypocrites <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 6:2,5,16)</i></b>. The occasion was<br>
 ripe here for this crisp saying. In <!-#-->Mt 13:33 leaven does not<br>
 have an evil sense as here, which see. See <!-#-->Mt 23:13 for<br>
 hypocrites. Hypocrisy was the leading Pharisaic vice <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b> and<br>
 was a mark of sanctity to hide an evil heart.<br>
 <br>
 12:2 <B>{Covered up}</B> <b><i>(\sugkekalummenon estin\)</i></b>. Periphrastic perfect<br>
 passive indicative of \sugkalupt&#333;\, an old verb, but here only in<br>
 the N.T., to cover up on all sides and so completely. Verses<br>
 <!-#-->2-9 here are parallel with <!-#-->Mt 10:26-33 spoken to the Twelve<br>
 on their tour of Galilee, illustrating again how often Jesus<br>
 repeated his sayings unless we prefer to say that he never did so<br>
 and that the Gospels have hopelessly jumbled them as to time and<br>
 place. See the passage in Matthew for discussion of details.<br>
 <br>
 12:3 <B>{In the inner chambers}</B> <b><i>(\en tois tameiois\)</i></b>. Old form<br>
 \tamieion\, a store chamber <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 12:24)</i></b>, secret room <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 6:6;<br>
 Lu 12:3)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:4 <B>{Unto you my friends}</B> <b><i>(\humin tois philois\)</i></b>. As opposed to<br>
 the Pharisees and lawyers in <!-#-->11:43,46,53. <B>{Be not afraid of}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275; phob&#275;th&#275;te apo\)</i></b>. First aorist passive subjunctive with<br>
 \m&#275;\, ingressive aorist, do not become afraid of, with \apo\ and<br>
 the ablative like the Hebrew _min_ and the English "be afraid<br>
 of," a translation Hebraism as in <!-#-->Mt 10:28 <b><i>(Moulton,<br>
 _Prolegomena_, p. 102)</i></b>. <B>{Have no more that they can do}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;<br>
 echont&#333;n perissoteron ti poi&#275;sai\)</i></b>. Luke often uses the<br>
 infinitive thus with \ech&#333;\, a classic idiom <b><i>(<!-#-->7:40,42; 12:4,50;<br>
 14:14; Ac 4:14, etc.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:5 <B>{Whom ye shall fear}</B> <b><i>(\tina phob&#275;th&#275;te\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive subjunctive deliberative retained in the indirect<br>
 question. \Tina\ is the accusative, the direct object of this<br>
 transitive passive verb <b><i>(note \apo\ in verse <!-#-->4)</i></b>. <B>{Fear him who}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\phob&#275;th&#275;te ton\)</i></b>. First aorist passive imperative, differing<br>
 from the preceding form only in the accent and governing the<br>
 accusative also. <B>{After he hath killed}</B> <b><i>(\meta to apokteinai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Preposition \meta\ with the articular infinitive. Literally,<br>
 "After the killing" <b><i>(first aorist active infinitive of the common<br>
 verb \apoktein&#333;\, to kill. <B>{Into hell}</B> (\eis t&#275;n geennan\)</i></b>. See<br>
 on &#175;Mt 5:22. Gehenna is a transliteration of _Ge-Hinnom_, Valley<br>
 of Hinnon where the children were thrown on to the red-hot arms<br>
 of Molech. Josiah <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ki 23:10)</i></b> abolished these abominations and<br>
 then it was a place for all kinds of refuse which burned<br>
 ceaselessly and became a symbol of punishment in the other world.<br>
 <B>{This one fear}</B> <b><i>(\touton phob&#275;th&#275;te\)</i></b>. As above.<br>
 <br>
 12:6 <B>{Is forgotten}</B> <b><i>(\estin epilel&#275;smenon\)</i></b>. Periphrastic perfect<br>
 passive indicative of \epilanthanomai\, common verb to forget.<br>
 See <!-#-->Mt 10:29 for a different construction.<br>
 <br>
 12:7 <B>{Numbered}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rithm&#275;ntai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative.<br>
 Periphrastic form in <!-#-->Mt 10:30 which see for details about<br>
 sparrows, etc.<br>
 <br>
 12:8 <B>{Everyone who shall confess me}</B> <b><i>(\pas hos an homolog&#275;sei en<br>
 emoi\)</i></b>. Just like <!-#-->Mt 10:32 except the use of \an\ here which<br>
 adds nothing. The Hebraistic use of \en\ after \homologe&#333;\ both<br>
 here and in Matthew is admitted by even Moulton <b><i>(_Prolegomena_,<br>
 p. 104)</i></b>. <B>{The Son of man}</B> <b><i>(\ho huios tou anthr&#333;pou\)</i></b>. Here <!-#-->Mt<br>
 10:32 has \k'ag&#333;\ <b><i>(I also)</i></b> as the equivalent.<br>
 <br>
 12:9 <B>{Shall be denied}</B> <b><i>(\aparn&#275;th&#275;setai\)</i></b>. First future passive<br>
 of the compound verb \aparneomai\. Here <!-#-->Mt 10:33 has<br>
 \arn&#275;somai\ simply. Instead of "in the presence of the angels of<br>
 God" <b><i>(\emprosthen t&#333;n aggel&#333;n tou theou\)</i></b> <!-#-->Mt 10:33 has "before<br>
 my Father who is in heaven."<br>
 <br>
 12:10 <B>{But unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\t&#333;i de eis to hagion pneuma blasph&#275;m&#275;santi\)</i></b>. This unpardonable<br>
 sin is given by <!-#-->Mr 3:28f.; Mt 12:31f. immediately after the<br>
 charge that Jesus was in league with Beelzebub. Luke here<br>
 separates it from the same charge made in Judea <b><i>(<!-#-->11:15-20)</i></b>. As<br>
 frequently said, there is no sound reason for saying that Jesus<br>
 only spoke his memorable sayings once. Luke apparently finds a<br>
 different environment here. Note the use of \eis\ here in the<br>
 sense of "against."<br>
 <br>
 12:11 <B>{Be not anxious}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; merimn&#275;s&#275;te\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 subjunctive with \m&#275;\ in prohibition. Do not become anxious. See<br>
 a similar command to the Twelve on their Galilean tour <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 10:19f.)</i></b> and in the great discourse on the Mount of Olives at<br>
 the end <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 13:11; Lu 21:14f.)</i></b>, given twice by Luke as we see.<br>
 <B>{How or what ye shall answer}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;s &#275; ti apolog&#275;s&#275;sthe\)</i></b>.<br>
 Indirect question and retaining the deliberative subjunctive<br>
 \apolog&#275;s&#275;sthe\ and also \eip&#275;te\ <b><i>(say)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:12 <B>{What ye ought to say}</B> <b><i>(\h&#257; dei eipein\)</i></b>. Literally, what<br>
 things it is necessary <b><i>(\dei\)</i></b> to say. This is no excuse for<br>
 neglect in pulpit preparation. It is simply a word for courage in<br>
 a crisis to play the man for Christ and to trust the issue with<br>
 God without fear.<br>
 <br>
 12:13 <B>{Bid my brother}</B> <b><i>(\eipe t&#333;i adelph&#333;i mou\)</i></b>. This volunteer<br>
 from the crowd draws attention to the multitude <b><i>(verses <!-#-->13-21)</i></b>.<br>
 He does not ask for arbitration and there is no evidence that his<br>
 brother was willing for that. He wants a decision by Jesus<br>
 against his brother. The law <b><i>(<!-#-->De 21:17)</i></b> was two-thirds to the<br>
 elder, one-third to the younger.<br>
 <br>
 12:14 <B>{A judge or a divider}</B> <b><i>(\krit&#275;n &#275; merist&#275;n\)</i></b>. Jesus<br>
 repudiates the position of judge or arbiter in this family fuss.<br>
 The language reminds one of <!-#-->Ex 2:14. Jesus is rendering unto<br>
 Caesar the things of Caesar <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 20:25)</i></b> and shows that his<br>
 kingdom is not of this world <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:36)</i></b>. The word for divider<br>
 or arbiter <b><i>(\merist&#275;s\)</i></b> is a late word from \merizomai\ <b><i>(verse<br>
 <!-#-->13)</i></b> and occurs here only in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 12:15 <B>{From all covetousness}</B> <b><i>(\apo pas&#275;s pleonexias\)</i></b>. Ablative<br>
 case. From every kind of greedy desire for more <b><i>(\pleon\, more,<br>
 \hexia\, from \ech&#333;\, to have)</i></b> an old word which we have robbed<br>
 of its sinful aspects and refined to mean business thrift. <B>{In<br>
 the abundance of the things which he possesseth}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i<br>
 perisseuein tini ek t&#333;n huparchont&#333;n aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. A rather awkward<br>
 Lukan idiom: "In the abounding <b><i>(articular infinitive)</i></b> to one out<br>
 of the things belonging <b><i>(articular participle)</i></b> to him."<br>
 <br>
 12:16 <B>{A parable unto them}</B> <b><i>(\parabol&#275;n pros autous\)</i></b>. The<br>
 multitude of verses <!-#-->13,15. A short and pungent parable<br>
 suggested by the covetousness of the man of verse <!-#-->13. <B>{Brought<br>
 forth plentifully}</B> <b><i>(\euphor&#275;sen\)</i></b>. Late word from \euphoros\<br>
 <b><i>(bearing well)</i></b>, in medical writers and Josephus, here only in the<br>
 N.T.<br>
 <br>
 12:17 <B>{Reasoned within himself}</B> <b><i>(\dielogizeto en haut&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect middle, picturing his continued cogitations over his<br>
 perplexity. <B>{Where to bestow}</B> <b><i>(\pou sunax&#333;\)</i></b>. Future indicative<br>
 deliberative, where I shall gather together. <B>{My fruits}</B> <b><i>(\tous<br>
 karpous mou\)</i></b>. So it is with the rich fool: my fruits, my barns,<br>
 my corn, my goods, just like Nabal whose very name means fool<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Sa 25:11)</i></b>, whether a direct reference to him or not.<br>
 <br>
 12:18 <B>{I will pull down}</B> <b><i>(\kathel&#333;\)</i></b>. Future active of<br>
 \kathaire&#333;\, an old verb, the usual future being \kathair&#275;s&#333;\.<br>
 This second form from the second aorist \katheilon\ <b><i>(from<br>
 obsolete \hel&#333;\)</i></b> like \aphelei\ in <!-#-->Re 22:19. <B>{My barns}</B> <b><i>(\mou<br>
 tas apoth&#275;kas\)</i></b>. From \apotith&#275;mi\, to lay by, to treasure. So a<br>
 granary or storehouse, an old word, six times in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 3:12; 6:26; 13:30; Lu 3:17; 12:18,24)</i></b>. <B>{All my corn}</B> <b><i>(\panta ton<br>
 siton\)</i></b>. Better grain <b><i>(wheat, barley)</i></b>, not maize or Indian corn.<br>
 <B>{My goods}</B> <b><i>(\ta agatha mou\)</i></b>. Like the English, my good things.<br>
 So the English speak of goods <b><i>(freight)</i></b> train.<br>
 <br>
 12:19 <B>{Laid up for many years}</B> <b><i>(\keimena eis et&#275; polla\)</i></b>. Not in<br>
 D and some other Latin MSS. The man's apostrophe to his "soul"<br>
 <b><i>(\psuch&#275;\)</i></b> is thoroughly Epicurean, for his soul feeds on his<br>
 goods. The asyndeton here <b><i>(take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry)</i></b><br>
 shows his eagerness. Note difference in tenses <b><i>(\anapauou\, keep<br>
 on resting, \phage\, eat at once, \pie\, drink thy fill,<br>
 \euphrainou\, keep on being merry)</i></b>, first and last presents, the<br>
 other two aorists.<br>
 <br>
 12:20 <B>{Thou foolish one}</B> <b><i>(\aphr&#333;n\)</i></b>. Fool, for lack of sense <b><i>(\a\<br>
 privative and \phr&#275;n\, sense)</i></b> as in <!-#-->11:40; 2Co 11:19. Old word,<br>
 used by Socrates in Xenophon. Nominative form as vocative. <B>{Is<br>
 thy soul required of thee}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n psuch&#275;n sou aitousin apo sou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Plural active present, not passive: "They are demanding thy soul<br>
 from thee." The impersonal plural <b><i>(aitousin)</i></b> is common enough<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:38; 12:11; 16:9; 23:31)</i></b>. The rabbis used "they" to avoid<br>
 saying "God."<br>
 <br>
 12:21 <B>{Not rich toward God}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; eis theon plout&#333;n\)</i></b>. The only<br>
 wealth that matters and that lasts. Cf. <!-#-->16:9; Mt 6:19f. Some<br>
 MSS. do not have this verse. Westcott and Hort bracket it.<br>
 <br>
 12:22 <B>{Unto his disciples}</B> <b><i>(\pros tous math&#275;tas autou\)</i></b>. So Jesus<br>
 turns from the crowd to the disciples <b><i>(verses <!-#-->22-40, when Peter<br>
 interrupts the discourse)</i></b>. From here to the end of the chapter<br>
 Luke gives material that appears in Matthew, but not in one<br>
 connection as here. In Matthew part of it is in the charge to the<br>
 Twelve on their tour in Galilee, part in the eschatological<br>
 discourse on the Mount of Olives. None of it is in Mark. Hence Q<br>
 or the Logia seems to be the source of it. The question recurs<br>
 again whether Jesus repeated on other occasions what is given<br>
 here or whether Luke has here put together separate discourses as<br>
 Matthew is held by many to have done in the Sermon on the Mount.<br>
 We have no way of deciding these points. We can only say again<br>
 that Jesus would naturally repeat his favourite sayings like<br>
 other popular preachers and teachers. So <!-#-->Lu 12:22-31<br>
 corresponds to <!-#-->Mt 6:25-33, which see for detailed discussion.<br>
 The parable of the rich fool was spoken to the crowd, but this<br>
 exhortation to freedom from care <b><i>(<!-#-->22-31)</i></b> is to the disciples.<br>
 So the language in <!-#-->Lu 12:22 is precisely that in <!-#-->Mt 6:25. See<br>
 there for \m&#275; merimn&#257;te\ <b><i>(stop being anxious)</i></b> and the<br>
 deliberative subjunctive retained in the indirect question<br>
 <b><i>(\phag&#275;te, endus&#275;sthe\)</i></b>. So verse <!-#-->23 here is the same in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 6:25 except that there it is a question with \ouch\ expecting<br>
 the affirmative answer, whereas here it is given as a reason<br>
 <b><i>(\gar\, for)</i></b> for the preceding command.<br>
 <br>
 12:24 <B>{The ravens}</B> <b><i>(\tous korakas\)</i></b>. Nowhere else in the N.T. The<br>
 name includes the whole crow group of birds <b><i>(rooks and jackdaws)</i></b>.<br>
 Like the vultures they are scavengers. <!-#-->Mt 6:26 has simply "the<br>
 birds" <b><i>(\ta peteina\)</i></b>. <B>{Storechamber}</B> <b><i>(tameion)</i></b>. Not in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 6:26. Means secret chamber in <!-#-->Lu 12:3. <B>{Of how much more}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pos&#333;i m&#257;llon\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 6:26 has question, \ouch m&#257;llon\.<br>
 <br>
 12:25 <B>{A cubit}</B> <b><i>(\p&#275;chun\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 6:27 has \p&#275;chun hena\ <b><i>(one<br>
 cubit, though \hena\ is sometimes merely the indefinite article.<br>
 <B>{Stature}</B> (\h&#275;likian\)</i></b> as in Matthew, which see.<br>
 <br>
 12:26 <B>{Not able to do even that which is least}</B> <b><i>(\oude elachiston<br>
 dunasthe\)</i></b>. Negative \oude\ in the condition of the first class.<br>
 Elative superlative, very small. This verse not in Matthew and<br>
 omitted in D. Verse <!-#-->27 as in <!-#-->Mt 6:28, save that the verbs for<br>
 toil and spin are plural in Matthew and singular here <b><i>(neuter<br>
 plural subject, \ta krina\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:28 <B>{Clothe}</B> <b><i>(\amphiazei\)</i></b>. Late Greek verb in the _Koin&#275;_<br>
 <b><i>(papyri)</i></b> for the older form \amphiennumi\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 6:30)</i></b>. See<br>
 Matthew for discussion of details. Matthew has "the grass of the<br>
 field" instead of "the grass in the field" as here.<br>
 <br>
 12:29 <B>{Seek not ye}</B> <b><i>(\humeis m&#275; z&#275;teite\)</i></b>. Note emphatic position<br>
 of "ye" <b><i>(\humeis\)</i></b>. Stop seeking <b><i>(\m&#275;\ and present imperative<br>
 active)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 6:31 has: "Do not become anxious" <b><i>(\m&#275;<br>
 merimn&#275;s&#275;te\)</i></b>, \m&#275;\ and ingressive subjunctive occur as direct<br>
 questions <b><i>(What are we to eat? What are we to drink? What are we<br>
 to put on?)</i></b> whereas here they are in the indirect form as in<br>
 verse <!-#-->22 save that the problem of clothing is not here<br>
 mentioned: <B>{Neither be ye of doubtful mind}</B> <b><i>(\kai m&#275;<br>
 mete&#333;rizesthe\)</i></b>. \M&#275;\ and present passive imperative <b><i>(stop being<br>
 anxious)</i></b> of \mete&#333;riz&#333;\. An old verb from \mete&#333;ros\ in midair,<br>
 high <b><i>(our meteor)</i></b>, to lift up on high, then to lift oneself up<br>
 with hopes <b><i>(false sometimes)</i></b>, to be buoyed up, to be tossed like<br>
 a ship at sea, to be anxious, to be in doubt as in late writers<br>
 <b><i>(Polybius, Josephus)</i></b>. This last meaning is probably true here. In<br>
 the LXX and Philo, but here only in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 12:31 See <!-#-->Mt 6:33 for this verse. Luke does not have "first"<br>
 nor "his righteousness" nor "all."<br>
 <br>
 12:32 <B>{Little flock}</B> <b><i>(\to mikron poimnion\)</i></b>. Vocative with the<br>
 article as used in Hebrew and often in the _Koin&#275;_ and so in the<br>
 N.T. See both \pater\ and \ho pat&#275;r\ in the vocative in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 10:21. See Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 465f. \Poimnion\ <b><i>(flock)</i></b> is<br>
 a contraction from \poimenion\ from \poim&#275;n\ <b><i>(shepherd)</i></b> instead<br>
 of the usual \poimn&#275;\ <b><i>(flock)</i></b>. So it is not a diminutive and<br>
 \mikron\ is not superfluous, though it is pathetic. <B>{For it is<br>
 your Father's good pleasure}</B> <b><i>(\hoti eudok&#275;sen ho pat&#275;r hum&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active indicative of \eudoke&#333;\. Timeless aorist as<br>
 in <!-#-->Lu 3:22. This verse has no parallel in Matthew.<br>
 <br>
 12:33 <B>{Sell that ye have}</B> <b><i>(\P&#333;l&#275;sate ta huparchonta hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Not<br>
 in Matthew. Did Jesus mean this literally and always? Luke has<br>
 been charged with Ebionism, but Jesus does not condemn property<br>
 as inherently sinful. "The attempt to keep the letter of the rule<br>
 here given <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 2:44,45)</i></b> had disastrous effects on the church of<br>
 Jerusalem, which speedily became a church of paupers, constantly<br>
 in need of alms <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 15:25,26; 1Co 16:3; 2Co 8:4; 9:1)</i></b>"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{Purses which wax not old}</B> <b><i>(\ballantia m&#275;<br>
 palaioumena\)</i></b>. So already \ballantion\ in <!-#-->Lu 10:4. Late verb<br>
 \palaio&#333;\ from \palaios\, old, to make old, declare old as in<br>
 <!-#-->Heb 8:13, is passive to become old as here and <!-#-->Heb 1:11.<br>
 <B>{That faileth not}</B> <b><i>(\anekleipton\)</i></b>. Verbal from \a\ privative and<br>
 \ekleip&#333;\, to fail. Late word in Diodorus and Plutarch. Only here<br>
 in the N.T. or LXX, but in papyri. "I prefer to believe that even<br>
 Luke sees in the words not a mechanical rule, but a law for the<br>
 spirit" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. <B>{Draweth near}</B> <b><i>(\eggizei\)</i></b>. Instead of <!-#-->Mt 6:19<br>
 "dig through and steal." <B>{Destroyeth}</B> <b><i>(\diaphtheirei\)</i></b>. Instead<br>
 of "doth consume" in <!-#-->Mt 6:19.<br>
 <br>
 12:34 <B>{Will be}</B> <b><i>(\estai\)</i></b>. Last word in the sentence in Luke.<br>
 Otherwise like <!-#-->Mt 6:21. See <!-#-->1Co 7:32-34 for similar<br>
 principle.<br>
 <br>
 12:35 <B>{Be girded about}</B> <b><i>(\est&#333;san periez&#333;smenai\)</i></b>. Periphrastic<br>
 perfect passive imperative third plural of the verb \periz&#333;nnumi\<br>
 or \periz&#333;nnu&#333;\ <b><i>(later form)</i></b>, an old verb, to gird around, to<br>
 fasten the garments with a girdle. The long garments of the<br>
 orientals made speed difficult. It was important to use the<br>
 girdle before starting. Cf. <!-#-->17:8; Ac 12:8. <B>{Burning}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kaiomenoi\)</i></b>. Periphrastic present middle imperative, already<br>
 burning and continuously burning. The same point of the Parable<br>
 of the Ten Virgins <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 25:1-13)</i></b> is found here in condensed<br>
 form. This verse introduces the parable of the waiting servants<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 12:35-40)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:36 <B>{When he shall return from the marriage feast}</B> <b><i>(\pote<br>
 analus&#275;i ek t&#333;n gam&#333;n\)</i></b>. The interrogative conjunction \pote\ and<br>
 the deliberative aorist subjunctive retained in the indirect<br>
 question. The verb \analu&#333;\, very common Greek verb, but only<br>
 twice in the N.T. <b><i>(here and <!-#-->Php 1:23)</i></b>. The figure is breaking<br>
 up a camp or loosening the mooring of a ship, to depart. Perhaps<br>
 here the figure is from the standpoint of the wedding feast<br>
 <b><i>(plural as used of a single wedding feast in <!-#-->Lu 14:8)</i></b>,<br>
 departing from there. See on &#175;Mt 22:2. <B>{When he cometh and<br>
 knocketh}</B> <b><i>(\elthontos kai krousantos\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute of the<br>
 aorist active participle without \autou\ and in spite of \autoi\<br>
 <b><i>(dative)</i></b> being used after \anoix&#333;sin\ <b><i>(first aorist active<br>
 subjunctive of \anoig&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:37 <B>{He shall gird himself}</B> <b><i>(\periz&#333;setai\)</i></b>. Direct future<br>
 middle. Jesus did this <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 13:4)</i></b>, not out of gratitude, but to<br>
 give the apostles an object lesson in humility. See the usual<br>
 course in <!-#-->Lu 17:7-10 with also the direct middle <b><i>(verse <!-#-->8)</i></b> of<br>
 \peris&#333;nnu&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 12:38 <B>{And if}</B> <b><i>(\k'an = kai + ean\)</i></b>. Repeated. \Elth&#275;i\ and<br>
 \heur&#275;i\, both second aorist subjunctive with \ean\, condition of<br>
 the third class, undetermined, but with prospect of being<br>
 determined. <B>{Blessed}</B> <b><i>(\makarioi\)</i></b>. Beatitude here as in verse<br>
 <!-#-->37.<br>
 <br>
 12:39 <B>{The thief}</B> <b><i>(\ho klept&#275;s\)</i></b>. The change here almost makes a<br>
 new parable to illustrate the other, the parable of the<br>
 housebreaking <b><i>(verses <!-#-->39,40)</i></b> to illustrate the parable of the<br>
 waiting servants <b><i>(<!-#-->35-38)</i></b>. This same language appears in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 24:43f. "The Master returning from a wedding is replaced by a<br>
 thief whose study it is to come to the house he means to plunder<br>
 at an unexpected time" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. The parallel in <!-#-->Mt 24:43-51<br>
 with <!-#-->Lu 12:39-46 does not have the interruption by Peter. <B>{He<br>
 would have watched}</B> <b><i>(\egr&#275;gor&#275;sen an\)</i></b>. Apodosis of second-class<br>
 condition, determined as unfulfilled, made plain by use of \an\<br>
 with aorist indicative which is not repeated with \ouk aph&#275;ken\<br>
 <b><i>(first aorist active indicative of \aphi&#275;mi\, \k\ aorist)</i></b>, though<br>
 it is sometimes repeated <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 24:43)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:40 <B>{Be ye}</B> <b><i>(\ginesthe\)</i></b>. Present middle imperative, keep on<br>
 becoming. <B>{Cometh}</B> <b><i>(\erchetai\)</i></b>. Futuristic present indicative.<br>
 See <!-#-->Mt 24:43-51 for details in the comparison with Luke.<br>
 <br>
 12:41 <B>{Peter said}</B> <b><i>(\Eipen de ho Petros\)</i></b>. This whole paragraph<br>
 from verse <!-#-->22-40 had been addressed directly to the disciples.<br>
 Hence it is not surprising to find Peter putting in a question.<br>
 This incident confirms also the impression that Luke is giving<br>
 actual historical data in the environment of these discourses. He<br>
 is certain that the Twelve are meant, but he desires to know if<br>
 others are included, for he had spoken to the multitude in verses<br>
 <!-#-->13-21. Recall <!-#-->Mr 13:37. This interruption is somewhat like<br>
 that on the Mount of Transfiguration <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:33)</i></b> and is<br>
 characteristic of Peter. Was it the magnificent promise in verse<br>
 <!-#-->37 that stirred Peter's impulsiveness? It is certainly more<br>
 than a literary device of Luke. Peter's question draws out a<br>
 parabolic reply by Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->42-48)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:42 <B>{Who then}</B> <b><i>(\tis ara\)</i></b>. Jesus introduces this parable of<br>
 the wise steward <b><i>(<!-#-->42-48)</i></b> by a rhetorical question that answers<br>
 itself. Peter is this wise steward, each of the Twelve is, anyone<br>
 is who acts thus. <B>{The faithful and wise steward}</B> <b><i>(\ho pistos<br>
 oikonomos ho phronimos\)</i></b>. The faithful steward, the wise one. A<br>
 steward is house manager <b><i>(\oikos, nem&#333;\, to manage)</i></b>. Each man is<br>
 a steward in his own responsibilities. <B>{Household}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\therapeias\)</i></b>. Literally, service from \therapeu&#333;\. medical<br>
 service as in <!-#-->Lu 9:11, by metonymy household <b><i>(a body of those<br>
 domestics who serve)</i></b>. <B>{Their portion of food}</B> <b><i>(\to sitometrion\)</i></b>.<br>
 Late word from \sitometre&#333;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 47:12)</i></b> for the Attic \ton siton<br>
 metre&#333;\, to measure the food, the rations. Here only in the N.T.<br>
 or anywhere else till Deissmann <b><i>(_Bible Studies_, p. 158)</i></b> found<br>
 it in an Egyptian papyrus and then an inscription in Lycia<br>
 <b><i>(_Light from the Ancient East_, p. 104)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:44 <B>{Over all}</B> <b><i>(\epi p&#257;sin\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mt 24-47 for \epi\ with<br>
 locative in this sense. Usually with genitive as in verse <!-#-->42<br>
 and sometimes with accusative as in verse <!-#-->14.<br>
 <br>
 12:45 <B>{Shall say}</B> <b><i>(\eip&#275;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist subjunctive, with<br>
 \ean\, condition of the third class, undetermined, but with<br>
 prospect of being determined. <B>{Delayeth}</B> <b><i>(\chronizei\)</i></b>. From<br>
 \chronos\, time, spends time, lingers. <B>{Shall begin}</B> <b><i>(\arx&#275;tai\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist middle subjunctive with \ean\ and the same condition<br>
 as \eip&#275;i\, above. <B>{The menservants}</B> <b><i>(\tous paidas\)</i></b> <B>{and the<br>
 maidservants}</B> <b><i>(\kai tas paidiskas\)</i></b>. \Paidisk&#275;\ is a diminutive<br>
 of \pais\ for a young female slave and occurs in the papyri,<br>
 orginally just a damsel. Here \pais\ can mean slave also though<br>
 strictly just a boy.<br>
 <br>
 12:46 <B>{Shall cut him asunder}</B> <b><i>(\dichotom&#275;sei\)</i></b>. An old and<br>
 somewhat rare word from \dichotomos\ and that from \dicha\ and<br>
 \temn&#333;\, to cut, to cut in two. Used literally here. In the N.T.<br>
 only here and <!-#-->Mt 24:51. <B>{With the unfaithful}</B> <b><i>(\meta t&#333;n<br>
 apist&#333;n\)</i></b>. Not here "the unbelieving" though that is a common<br>
 meaning of \apistos\ <b><i>(\a\ privative and \pistos\, from \peith&#333;\)</i></b>,<br>
 but the unreliable, the untrustworthy. Here <!-#-->Mt 24:51 has "with<br>
 the hypocrites," the same point. The parallel with <!-#-->Mt 24:43-51<br>
 ends here. <!-#-->Mt 24:51 adds the saying about the wailing and the<br>
 gnashing of teeth. Clearly there Luke places the parable of the<br>
 wise steward in this context while Matthew has it in the great<br>
 eschatological discourse. Once again we must either think that<br>
 Jesus repeated the parable or that one of the writers has<br>
 misplaced it. Luke alone preserves what he gives in verses<br>
 <!-#-->47,48.<br>
 <br>
 12:47 <B>{Which knew}</B> <b><i>(\ho gnous\)</i></b>. Articular participle <b><i>(second<br>
 aorist active, punctiliar and timeless)</i></b>. The one who knows. So as<br>
 to \m&#275; hetoimasas &#275; poi&#275;sas\ <b><i>(does not make ready or do)</i></b>. <B>{Shall<br>
 be beaten with many stripes}</B> <b><i>(\dar&#275;setai pollas\)</i></b>. Second future<br>
 passive of \der&#333;\, to skin, to beat, to flay <b><i>(see on <!-#-->Mt 21:35;<br>
 Mr 12:3,5)</i></b>. The passive voice retains here the accusative<br>
 \pollas\ <b><i>(supply \pl&#275;gas\, present in <!-#-->Lu 10:30)</i></b>. The same<br>
 explanation applies to \oligas\ in verse <!-#-->48.<br>
 <br>
 12:48 <B>{To whomsoever much is given}</B> <b><i>(\panti de h&#333;i edoth&#275; polu\)</i></b>.<br>
 Here is inverse attraction from \hoi\ to \panti\ <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, pp. 767f.)</i></b>. Note \par' autou\ <b><i>(from him)</i></b> without any<br>
 regard to \panti\. <B>{They commit}</B> <b><i>(\parethento\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 middle indicative, timeless or gnomic aorist. Note the impersonal<br>
 plural after the passive voice just before.<br>
 <br>
 12:49 <B>{I came to cast fire}</B> <b><i>(\Pur &#275;lthon balein\)</i></b>. Suddenly Jesus<br>
 lets the volcano in his own heart burst forth. The fire was<br>
 already burning. "Christ came to set the world on fire, and the<br>
 conflagration had already begun" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. The very passion in<br>
 Christ's heart would set his friends on fire and his foes in<br>
 opposition as we have just seen <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 11:53f.)</i></b>. It is like the<br>
 saying of Jesus that he came to bring not peace, but a sword, to<br>
 bring cleavage among men <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:34-36)</i></b>. <B>{And what will I, if it<br>
 is already kindled?}</B> <b><i>(\kai ti thel&#333; ei &#275;d&#275; an&#275;phth&#275;;\)</i></b>. It is not<br>
 clear what this passage means. Probably \ti\ is be taken in the<br>
 sense of "how" <b><i>(\p&#333;s\)</i></b>. How I wish. Then \ei\ can be taken as<br>
 equal to \hoti\. How I wish that it were already kindled.<br>
 \An&#275;phth&#275;\ is first aorist passive of \anapt&#333;\, to set fire to,<br>
 to kindle, to make blaze. Probably Luke means the conflagration<br>
 to come by his death on the Cross for he changes the figure and<br>
 refers to that more plainly.<br>
 <br>
 12:50 <B>{I have a baptism}</B> <b><i>(\baptisma de ech&#333;\)</i></b>. Once again Jesus<br>
 will call his baptism the baptism of blood and will challenge<br>
 James and John to it <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 10:32f.; Mt 20:22f.)</i></b>. So here. "Having<br>
 used the metaphor of fire, Christ now uses the metaphor of water.<br>
 The one sets forth the result of his coming as it affects the<br>
 world, the other as it affects himself. The world is lit up with<br>
 flames and Christ is bathed in blood" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{And how I am<br>
 straitened}</B> <b><i>(\kai p&#333;s sunechomai\)</i></b>. See this same vivid verb<br>
 \sunechomai\ in <!-#-->Lu 8:37; Ac 18:5; Php 1:23 where Paul uses it<br>
 of his desire for death just as Jesus does here. The urge of the<br>
 Cross is upon Jesus at the moment of these words. We catch a<br>
 glimpse of the tremendous passion in his soul that drove him on.<br>
 <B>{Till it be accomplished}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s hotou telesth&#275;i\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive subjunctive of \tele&#333;\ with \he&#333;s hotou\ <b><i>(until which<br>
 time)</i></b>, the common construction for the future with this<br>
 conjunction.<br>
 <br>
 12:51 <B>{But rather division}</B> <b><i>(\all' &#275; diamerismon\)</i></b>. Peace at any<br>
 price is not the purpose of Christ. It is a pity for family jars<br>
 to come, but loyalty to Christ counts more than all else. These<br>
 ringing words <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 12:51-53)</i></b> occur in <!-#-->Mt 10:34-36 in the<br>
 address to the Twelve for the Galilean tour. See discussion of<br>
 details there. These family feuds are inevitable where only part<br>
 cleave to Christ. In Matthew we have \kata\ with the genitive<br>
 whereas in Luke it is \epi\ with the dative <b><i>(and accusative<br>
 once)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:54 <B>{To the multitudes also}</B> <b><i>(\kai tois ochlois\)</i></b>. After the<br>
 strong and stirring words just before with flash and force Jesus<br>
 turns finally in this series of discourses to the multitudes<br>
 again as in verse <!-#-->15. There are similar sayings to these verses<br>
 <!-#-->54-59 in <!-#-->Mt 16:1f; 5:25f. There is a good deal of difference<br>
 in phraseology whether that is due to difference of source or<br>
 different use of the same source <b><i>(Q or Logia)</i></b> we do not know. Not<br>
 all the old MSS. give <!-#-->Mt 16:2,3. In Matthew the Pharisees and<br>
 Sadducees were asking for a sign from heaven as they often did.<br>
 These signs of the weather, "a shower" <b><i>(\ombros\, <!-#-->Lu 12:54)</i></b> due<br>
 to clouds in the west, "a hot wave" <b><i>(\kaus&#333;n\, verse 55)</i></b> due to a<br>
 south wind <b><i>(\noton\)</i></b> blowing, "fair weather" <b><i>(\eudia\, <!-#-->Mt 16:2)</i></b><br>
 when the sky is red, are appealed to today. They have a more or<br>
 less general application due to atmospheric and climatic<br>
 conditions.<br>
 <br>
 12:56 <B>{To interpret this time}</B> <b><i>(\ton kairon touton dokimazein\)</i></b>.<br>
 To test \dokimazein\ as spiritual chemists. No wonder that Jesus<br>
 here calls them "hypocrites" because of their blindness when<br>
 looking at and hearing him. So it is today with those who are<br>
 willfully blind to the steps of God among men. This ignorance of<br>
 the signs of the times is colossal.<br>
 <br>
 12:57 <B>{Even of yourselves}</B> <b><i>(\kai aph' heaut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Without the<br>
 presence and teaching of Jesus they had light enough to tell what<br>
 is right <b><i>(\to dikaion\)</i></b> and so without excuse as Paul argued in<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 1-3.<br>
 <br>
 12:58 <B>{Give diligence to be quit of him}</B> <b><i>(\dos ergasian<br>
 ap&#275;llachthai ap' autou\)</i></b>. Second aorist active imperative \dos\<br>
 from \did&#333;mi\. \Ap&#275;llachthai\, perfect passive infinitive of<br>
 \apallass&#333;\ an old verb common, but only twice in the N.T. <b><i>(here<br>
 and <!-#-->Ac 19:12)</i></b>. Used here in a legal sense and the tense<br>
 emphasizes a state of completion, to be rid of him for good.<br>
 <B>{Hale thee}</B> <b><i>(\katasur&#275;i\)</i></b>. Drag down forcibly, old verb, only<br>
 here in the N.T. <B>{To the officer}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i praktori\)</i></b>. The doer, the<br>
 proctor, the exactor of fines, the executor of punishment. Old<br>
 word, only here in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 12:59 <B>{Till thou have paid}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s apod&#333;is\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active subjunctive of \apodid&#333;mi\, to pay back in full. <B>{The last<br>
 mite}</B> <b><i>(\to eschaton lepton\)</i></b>. From \lep&#333;\, to peel off the bark.<br>
 Very small brass coin, one-eighth of an ounce. In the N.T. only<br>
 here and <!-#-->Lu 21:2; Mr 12:42 <b><i>(the poor widow's mite)</i></b> which see.<br>
