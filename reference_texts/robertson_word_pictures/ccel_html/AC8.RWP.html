 <HR>
<p>8:1 <B>{Was consenting}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n suneudok&#333;n\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect of<br>
 \suneudoke&#333;\, a late double compound <b><i>(\sun, eu, doke&#333;\)</i></b> that well<br>
 describes Saul's pleasure in the death <b><i>(\anairesis\, taking off,<br>
 only here in the N.T., though old word)</i></b> of Stephen. For the verb<br>
 see on &#175;Lu 23:32. Paul himself will later confess that he felt<br>
 so <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 22:20)</i></b>, coolly applauding the murder of Stephen, a<br>
 heinous sin <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:32)</i></b>. It is a gruesome picture. Chapter 7<br>
 should have ended here. <B>{On that day}</B> <b><i>(\en ekein&#275;i t&#275;i h&#275;mer&#257;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 On that definite day, that same day as in <!-#-->2:41. <B>{A great<br>
 persecution}</B> <b><i>(\di&#333;gmos megas\)</i></b>. It was at first persecution from<br>
 the Sadducees, but this attack on Stephen was from the Pharisees<br>
 so that both parties are now united in a general persecution that<br>
 deserves the adjective "great." See on &#175;Mt 13:21 for the old<br>
 word \di&#333;gmos\ from \di&#333;k&#333;\, to chase, hunt, pursue, persecute.<br>
 <B>{Were all scattered abroad}</B> <b><i>(\pantes diespar&#275;san\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 passive indicative of \diaspeir&#333;\, to scatter like grain, to<br>
 disperse, old word, in the N.T. only in <!-#-->Ac 8:1,4; 11:19.<br>
 <B>{Except the apostles}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;n t&#333;n apostol&#333;n\)</i></b>. Preposition \pl&#275;n\<br>
 <b><i>(adverb from \pleon\, more)</i></b> with the ablative often in Luke. It<br>
 remains a bit of a puzzle why the Pharisees spared the apostles.<br>
 Was it due to the advice of Gamaliel in <!-#-->Ac 5:34-40? Or was it<br>
 the courage of the apostles? Or was it a combination of both with<br>
 the popularity of the apostles in addition?<br>
 <br>
 8:2 <B>{Devout}</B> <b><i>(\eulabeis\)</i></b>. Only four times in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:25;<br>
 Ac 2:5; 8:2; 22:12)</i></b>. Possibly some non-Christian Jews helped.<br>
 The burial took place before the Christians were chiefly<br>
 scattered. <B>{Buried}</B> <b><i>(\sunekomisan\)</i></b>. Aorist active indicative of<br>
 \sunkomiz&#333;\, old verb to bring together, to collect, to join with<br>
 others in carrying, to bury <b><i>(the whole funeral arrangements)</i></b>.<br>
 Only here in the N.T. <B>{Lamentation}</B> <b><i>(\kopeton\)</i></b>. Late word from<br>
 \koptomai\, to beat the breast, in LXX, Plutarch, etc., only here<br>
 in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 8:3 <B>{Laid waste}</B> <b><i>(\elumaineto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of<br>
 \lumainomai\, old verb <b><i>(from \lum&#275;\, injury)</i></b>, to dishonour,<br>
 defile, devastate, ruin. Only here in the N.T. Like the laying<br>
 waste of a vineyard by a wild boar <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps 79:13)</i></b>. Picturesque<br>
 description of the havoc carried on by Saul now the leader in the<br>
 persecution. He is victor over Stephen now who had probably<br>
 worsted him in debate in the Cilician synagogue in Jerusalem.<br>
 <B>{Into every house}</B> <b><i>(\kata tous oikous\)</i></b>. But Luke terms it "the<br>
 church" <b><i>(\t&#275;n ekkl&#275;sian\)</i></b>. Plainly not just an "assembly," but an<br>
 organized body that was still "the church" when scattered in<br>
 their own homes, "an unassembled assembly" according to the<br>
 etymology. Words do not remain by the etymology, but travel on<br>
 with usage. <B>{Haling}</B> <b><i>(\sur&#333;n\)</i></b>. Literally, dragging forcibly<br>
 <b><i>(=hauling)</i></b>. Present active participle of \sur&#333;\, old verb. <B>{Men<br>
 and women}</B> <b><i>(\andras kai gunaikas\)</i></b>. A new feature of the<br>
 persecution that includes the women. They met it bravely as<br>
 through all the ages since <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->9:2; 22:4)</i></b>. This fact will be a<br>
 bitter memory for Paul always. <B>{Committed}</B> <b><i>(\paredidou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active of \paradid&#333;mi\, old verb, kept on handing them<br>
 over to prison.<br>
 <br>
 8:4 <B>{They therefore}</B> <b><i>(\hoi men oun\)</i></b>. Demonstrative \hoi\ as<br>
 often <b><i>(<!-#-->1:6, etc.)</i></b> though it will make sense as the article with<br>
 the participle \diasparentes\. The general statement is made here<br>
 by \men\ and a particular instance <b><i>(\de\)</i></b> follows in verse <!-#-->5.<br>
 The inferential particle <b><i>(\oun\)</i></b> points back to verse <!-#-->3, the<br>
 persecution by young Saul and the Pharisees. Jesus had commanded<br>
 the disciples not to depart from Jerusalem till they received the<br>
 Promise of the Father <b><i>(<!-#-->1:4)</i></b>, but they had remained long after<br>
 that and were not carrying the gospel to the other peoples<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1:8)</i></b>. Now they were pushed out by Saul and began as a result<br>
 to carry out the Great Commission for world conquest, that is<br>
 those "scattered abroad" <b><i>(\diasparentes\, second aorist passive<br>
 participle of \diaspeir&#333;\)</i></b>. This verb means disperse, to sow in<br>
 separate or scattered places <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> and so to drive people<br>
 hither and thither. Old and very common verb, especially in the<br>
 LXX, but in the N.T. only in <!-#-->Ac 8:1,4; 11:19. <B>{Went about}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\di&#275;lthon\)</i></b>. Constative second aorist active of \dierchomai\, to<br>
 go through <b><i>(from place to place, \dia\)</i></b>. Old and common verb,<br>
 frequent for missionary journeys in the Acts <b><i>(<!-#-->5:40; 8:40; 9:32;<br>
 11:19; 13:6)</i></b>. <B>{Preaching the word}</B> <b><i>(\euaggelizomenoi ton<br>
 logon\)</i></b>. Evangelizing or gospelizing the word <b><i>(the truth about<br>
 Christ)</i></b>. In <!-#-->11:19 Luke explains more fully the extent of the<br>
 labours of these new preachers of the gospel. They were emergency<br>
 preachers, not ordained clergymen, but men stirred to activity by<br>
 the zeal of Saul against them. The blood of the martyrs <b><i>(Stephen)</i></b><br>
 was already becoming the seed of the church. "The violent<br>
 dispersion of these earnest disciples resulted in a rapid<br>
 diffusion of the gospel" <b><i>(Alvah Hovey)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:5 <B>{Philip}</B> <b><i>(\Philippos\)</i></b>. The deacon <b><i>(<!-#-->6:5)</i></b> and evangelist<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->21:8)</i></b>, not the apostle of the same name <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 3:18)</i></b>. <B>{To the<br>
 city of Samaria}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n polin t&#275;s Samarias\)</i></b>. Genitive of<br>
 apposition. Samaria is the name of the city here. This is the<br>
 first instance cited of the expansion noted in verse <!-#-->4. Jesus<br>
 had an early and fruitful ministry in Samaria <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 4)</i></b>, though<br>
 the twelve were forbidden to go into a Samaritan city during the<br>
 third tour of Galilee <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:5)</i></b>, a temporary prohibition<br>
 withdrawn before Jesus ascended on high <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 1:8)</i></b>. <B>{Proclaimed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ek&#275;russen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, began to preach and kept on at<br>
 it. Note \euaggelizomenoi\ in verse <!-#-->4 of missionaries of good<br>
 news <b><i>(Page)</i></b> while \ek&#275;russen\ here presents the preacher as a<br>
 herald. He is also a teacher <b><i>(\didaskalos\)</i></b> like Jesus. Luke<br>
 probably obtained valuable information from Philip and his<br>
 daughters about these early days when in his home in Caesarea<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 21:8)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:6 <B>{Gave heed}</B> <b><i>(\proseichon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active as in verses<br>
 <!-#-->10,11, there with dative of the person <b><i>(\aut&#333;i\)</i></b>, here with the<br>
 dative of the thing <b><i>(\tois legomenois\)</i></b>. There is an ellipse of<br>
 \noun\ <b><i>(mind)</i></b>. They kept on giving heed or holding the mind on<br>
 the things said by Philip, spell-bound, in a word. <B>{When they<br>
 heard}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i akouein autous\)</i></b>. Favourite Lukan idiom, \en\ and<br>
 the locative case of the articlar infinitive with the accusative<br>
 of general reference "in the hearing as to them." <B>{Which he did}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ha epoiei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active again, which he kept on doing<br>
 from time to time. Philip wrought real miracles which upset the<br>
 schemes of Simon Magus.<br>
 <br>
 8:7 <B>{For many}</B> <b><i>(\polloi gar\)</i></b>. So the correct text of the best<br>
 MSS., but there is an anacoluthon as this nominative has no verb<br>
 with it. It was "the unclean spirits" that "came out"<br>
 <b><i>(\ex&#275;rchonto\, imperfect middle)</i></b>. The margin of the Revised<br>
 Version has it "came forth," as if they came out of a house, a<br>
 rather strained translation. The loud outcry is like the demons<br>
 cast out by Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 3:11; Lu 4:41)</i></b>. <B>{Palsied}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\paralelumenoi\, perfect passive participle)</i></b>. Luke's usual word,<br>
 loosened at the side, with no power over the muscles. Furneaux<br>
 notes that "the servant was reaping where the Master had sown.<br>
 Samaria was the mission field white for the harvest <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 4:35)</i></b>." The Samaritans who had been bewitched by Simon are now<br>
 carried away by Philip.<br>
 <br>
 8:9 <B>{Simon}</B> <b><i>(\Sim&#333;n\)</i></b>. One of the common names <b><i>(Josephus, _Ant_.<br>
 XX. 7, 2)</i></b> and a number of messianic pretenders had this name. A<br>
 large number of traditions in the second and third centuries<br>
 gathered round this man and Baur actually proposed that the Simon<br>
 of the Clementine Homilies is really the apostle Paul though Paul<br>
 triumphed over the powers of magic repeatedly <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 13:6-12;<br>
 19:11-19)</i></b>, "a perfect absurdity" <b><i>(Spitta, _Apostelgeschichte_,<br>
 p. 149)</i></b>. One of the legends is that this Simon Magus of Acts is<br>
 the father of heresy and went to Rome and was worshipped as a god<br>
 <b><i>(so Justin Martyr)</i></b>. But a stone found in the Tiber A.D. 1574 has<br>
 an inscription to _Semoni Sanco Deo Fidio Sacrum_ which is <b><i>(Page)</i></b><br>
 clearly to Hercules, Sancus being a Sabine name for Hercules.<br>
 This Simon in Samaria is simply one of the many magicians of the<br>
 time before the later gnosticism had gained a foothold. "In his<br>
 person Christianity was for the first time confronted with<br>
 superstition and religious imposture, of which the ancient world<br>
 was at this period full" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. <B>{Which beforetime used<br>
 sorcery}</B> <b><i>(\proup&#275;rchen mageu&#333;n\)</i></b>. An ancient idiom<br>
 <b><i>(periphrastic)</i></b>, the present active participle \mageu&#333;n\ with the<br>
 imperfect active verb from \prouparch&#333;\, the idiom only here and<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 23:12 in the N.T. Literally "Simon was existing previously<br>
 practising magic." This old verb \mageu&#333;\ is from \magos\ <b><i>(a<br>
 \magus\, seer, prophet, false prophet, sorcerer)</i></b> and occurs here<br>
 alone in the N.T. <B>{Amazed}</B> <b><i>(existan&#333;n)</i></b>. Present active participle<br>
 of the verb \existan&#333;\, later form of \exist&#275;mi\, to throw out of<br>
 position, displace, upset, astonish, chiefly in the Gospels in<br>
 the N.T. Same construction as \mageu&#333;n\. <B>{Some great one}</B> <b><i>(\tina<br>
 megan\)</i></b>. Predicate accusative of general reference <b><i>(infinitive in<br>
 indirect discourse)</i></b>. It is amazing how gullible people are in the<br>
 presence of a manifest impostor like Simon. The Magi were the<br>
 priestly order in the Median and Persian empires and were<br>
 supposed to have been founded by Zoroaster. The word \magoi\<br>
 <b><i>(magi)</i></b> has a good sense in <!-#-->Mt 2:1, but here and in <!-#-->Ac 13:6 it<br>
 has the bad sense like our "magic."<br>
 <br>
 8:10 <B>{That power of God which is called Great}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; Dunamis tou<br>
 theou h&#275; kaloumen&#275; Megal&#275;\)</i></b>. Apparently here already the oriental<br>
 doctrine of emanations or aeons so rampant in the second century.<br>
 This "power" was considered a spark of God himself and Jerome <b><i>(in<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 24)</i></b> quotes Simon <b><i>(Page)</i></b> as saying: _Ego sum sermo Dei, ...<br>
 ego omnipotens, ego omnia Dei_. Simon claimed to _impersonate<br>
 God_.<br>
 <br>
 8:11 <B>{Because that of long time he had amazed them with his<br>
 sorceries}</B> <b><i>(\dia to hikan&#333;i chron&#333;i tais magiais exestakenai<br>
 autous\)</i></b>. Causal use of \dia\ with the accusative articular<br>
 infinitive <b><i>(perfect active _Koin&#275;_ form and transitive,<br>
 \exestakenai\)</i></b>. Same verb as in verse <!-#-->9 participle \existan&#333;n\<br>
 and in verse <!-#-->13 imperfect passive \existato\ <b><i>(cf. also <!-#-->2:7<br>
 already)</i></b>. \Chron&#333;i\ is associative instrumental and \magiais\<br>
 instrumental case.<br>
 <br>
 8:12 <B>{They were baptized}</B> <b><i>(\ebaptizonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive<br>
 <b><i>(repetition, from time to time)</i></b>, while <B>{believed}</B> <b><i>(\episteusan\)</i></b><br>
 is constative aorist antecedent to the baptism. Note dative case<br>
 of Philip with \episteusan\. Note the gospel of Philip<br>
 "concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ."<br>
 <br>
 8:13 <B>{And Simon also himself believed}</B> <b><i>(\Ho de Sim&#333;n kai autos<br>
 episteusen\)</i></b>. Note the same verb in the aorist tense<br>
 \episteusen\. What did he believe? Evidently that Jesus was this<br>
 "power of God" not himself <b><i>(Simon)</i></b>. He saw that the miracles<br>
 wrought by Philip in the name of Christ were genuine while he<br>
 knew that his own were frauds. He wanted this power that Philip<br>
 had to add to his own pretensions. "He was probably half victim<br>
 of self-delusion, half conscious impostor" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. He was<br>
 determined to get this new "power," but had no sense of personal<br>
 need of Jesus as Saviour for his sins. So he submitted to baptism<br>
 <b><i>(\baptistheis\, first aorist passive participle of \baptiz&#333;\)</i></b>,<br>
 clear proof that baptism does not convey salvation. <B>{He continued<br>
 with Philip}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n proskarter&#333;n t&#333;i Philipp&#333;i\)</i></b>. Periphrastic<br>
 imperfect of the verb \proskartere&#333;\ <b><i>(see on &#175;2:46)</i></b>. He stuck to<br>
 Philip <b><i>(dative case)</i></b> to find out the secret of his power.<br>
 <B>{Beholding}</B> <b><i>(\the&#333;r&#333;n\)</i></b>. Watching the signs and miracles <b><i>(powers,<br>
 \dunameis\ that threw his "power" in the shade)</i></b> as they were<br>
 wrought <b><i>(\ginomenas\, present middle participle of \ginomai\)</i></b>.<br>
 The more he watched the more the wonder grew <b><i>(\existato\)</i></b>. He had<br>
 "amazed" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->9)</i></b> the people by his tricks and he was himself<br>
 more "amazed" than they by Philip's deeds.<br>
 <br>
 8:14 <B>{That Samaria had received}</B> <b><i>(\hoti dedektai h&#275; Samaria\)</i></b>.<br>
 The district here, not the city as in verse <!-#-->5. Perfect middle<br>
 indicative of \dechomai\ retained in indirect discourse. It was a<br>
 major event for the apostles for now the gospel was going into<br>
 Samaria as Jesus had predicted <b><i>(<!-#-->1:8)</i></b>. Though the Samaritans<br>
 were nominally Jews, they were not held so by the people. The<br>
 sending of Peter and John was no reflection on Philip, but was an<br>
 appropriate mission since "many Christian Jews would be<br>
 scandalized by the admission of Samaritans" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. If Peter<br>
 and John sanctioned it, the situation would be improved. John had<br>
 once wanted to call down fire from heaven on a Samaritan village<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:54)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:15 <B>{That they might receive}</B> <b><i>(\hop&#333;s lab&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active subjunctive of \lamban&#333;\, final clause with \hop&#333;s\. Did<br>
 they wish the Samaritan Pentecost to prove beyond a doubt that<br>
 the Samaritans were really converted when they believed? They had<br>
 been baptized on the assumption that the Holy Spirit had given<br>
 them new hearts. The coming of the Holy Spirit with obvious signs<br>
 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->10:44-48)</i></b> as in Jerusalem would make it plain.<br>
 <br>
 8:16 <B>{He was fallen}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n epipept&#333;kos\)</i></b>. Periphrastic past<br>
 perfect active of \epipipt&#333;\, old verb. The participle is neuter<br>
 here because of the grammatical gender of \pneuma\, but the<br>
 translation should be "he" <b><i>(natural gender)</i></b>, not "it." We should<br>
 not use "it" for the Holy Spirit. <B>{Only they had been baptized}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\monon de babaptismenoi hup&#275;rchon\)</i></b>. Periphrastic past perfect<br>
 passive of \baptiz&#333;\ with \huparch&#333;\ <b><i>(see verse <!-#-->9<br>
 \proup&#275;rchon\)</i></b>, instead of \&#275;san\. <B>{Into the name}</B> <b><i>(\eis to<br>
 onoma\)</i></b>. Better, in the name <b><i>(see on &#175;2:38)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:17 <B>{Laid they their hands}</B> <b><i>(\epetithesan tas cheiras\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active, repetition. The laying on of hands did not<br>
 occur at the great Pentecost <b><i>(<!-#-->2:4,33)</i></b> nor in <!-#-->4:31; 10:44 nor<br>
 is it mentioned in <!-#-->1Co 12; 14. It is mentioned in <!-#-->Ac 6:7<br>
 about the deacons and in <!-#-->13:3 when Barnabas and Saul left<br>
 Antioch. And in Saul's case it was Ananias who laid his hands on<br>
 him <b><i>(<!-#-->9:17)</i></b>. Hence it cannot be concluded that the Holy Spirit<br>
 was received only by the laying on of the hands of the apostles<br>
 or by the hands of anyone. The so-called practice of<br>
 "confirmation" appeals to this passage, but inconclusively. <B>{They<br>
 received}</B> <b><i>(\elambanon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, repetition as before<br>
 and \pari passu\ with the laying on of the hands.<br>
 <br>
 8:18 <B>{When Simon saw}</B> <b><i>(\Id&#333;n de ho Sim&#333;n\)</i></b>. This participle<br>
 <b><i>(second aorist active of \hora&#333;\)</i></b> shows plainly that those who<br>
 received the gift of the Holy Spirit spoke with tongues. Simon<br>
 now saw power transferred to others. Hence he was determined to<br>
 get this new power. <B>{He offered them money}</B> <b><i>(\pros&#275;negken<br>
 chr&#275;mata\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative of \prospher&#333;\. He<br>
 took Peter to be like himself, a mountebank performer who would<br>
 sell his tricks for enough money. Trafficking in things sacred<br>
 like ecclesiastical preferments in England is called "Simony"<br>
 because of this offer of Simon.<br>
 <br>
 8:19 <B>{Me also}</B> <b><i>(\kamoi\)</i></b>. This is the whole point with this<br>
 charlatan. He wants the power to pass on "this power." His notion<br>
 of "The Holy Spirit" was on this low level. He regarded spiritual<br>
 functions as a marketable commodity. Money "can buy diamonds, but<br>
 not wisdom, or sympathy, or faith, or holiness" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:20 <B>{Perish with thee}</B> <b><i>(\sun soi ei&#275; eis ap&#333;leian\)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 Be with thee for destruction. Optative for a future wish. The use<br>
 of \eis\ with the accusative in the predicate is especially<br>
 common in the LXX. The wish reveals Peter's indignation at the<br>
 base offer of Simon. Peter was no grafter to accept money for<br>
 spiritual power. He spurned the temptation. The natural meaning<br>
 of Peter's language is that Simon was on the road to destruction.<br>
 It is a warning and almost a curse on him, though verse <!-#-->22<br>
 shows that there was still room for repentance. <B>{To obtain}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kt&#257;sthai\)</i></b>. To acquire. Usual meaning of the present tense<br>
 <b><i>(infinitive middle)</i></b> of \ktaomai\.<br>
 <br>
 8:21 <B>{Lot}</B> <b><i>(\kl&#275;ros\)</i></b>. Same idea as "part" <b><i>(\meris\)</i></b>, only as a<br>
 figure. <B>{Matter}</B> <b><i>(\logoi\)</i></b>. Literally, word or subject <b><i>(as in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 1:4; Ac 15:6)</i></b>, the power of communicating the Holy Spirit. This<br>
 use of \logos\ is in the ancient Greek. <B>{Straight}</B> <b><i>(\eutheia\)</i></b>.<br>
 Quotation from <!-#-->Ps 78:37. Originally a mathematically straight<br>
 line as in <!-#-->Ac 9:11, then moral rectitude as here.<br>
 <br>
 8:22 <B>{Wickedness}</B> <b><i>(\kakias\)</i></b>. Only here in Luke's writings,<br>
 though old word and in LXX <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1Pe 2:1,16)</i></b>. <B>{If perhaps}</B> <b><i>(\ei<br>
 ara\)</i></b>. _Si forte_. This idiom, though with the future indicative<br>
 and so a condition of the first class <b><i>(determined as fulfilled)</i></b>,<br>
 yet minimizes the chance of forgiveness as in <!-#-->Mr 11:13. Peter<br>
 may have thought that his sin was close to the unpardonable sin<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 12:31)</i></b>, but he does not close the door of hope. <B>{The<br>
 thought}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; epinoia\)</i></b>. Old Greek word from \epinoe&#333;\, to think<br>
 upon, and so purpose. Only here in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 8:23 <B>{That thou art}</B> <b><i>(\se onta\)</i></b>. Participle in indirect<br>
 discourse after \hor&#333;\ <b><i>(I see)</i></b>. <B>{In the gall of bitterness}</B> <b><i>(\eis<br>
 chol&#275;n pikrias\)</i></b>. Old word from \cholas\ either from \che&#333;\, to<br>
 pour, or \chlo&#275;\, yellowish green, bile or gall. In the N.T. only<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 27:34 and here. In LXX in sense of wormwood as well as<br>
 bile. See <!-#-->De 29:18; 32:32; La 3:15; Job 16:14. "Gall and<br>
 bitterness" in <!-#-->De 29:18. Here the gall is described by the<br>
 genitive \pikrias\ as consisting in "bitterness." In <!-#-->Heb 12:15<br>
 "a root of bitterness," a bitter root. This word \pikria\ in the<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->Heb 12:15; Ro 3:14; Eph 4:31. The "bond of<br>
 iniquity" <b><i>(\sundesmon adikias\)</i></b> is from <!-#-->Isa 58:6. Paul uses<br>
 this word of peace <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph 4:3)</i></b>, of love <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 3:14)</i></b>, of the body<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 2:19)</i></b>. Peter describes Simon's offer as poison and a<br>
 chain.<br>
 <br>
 8:24 <B>{Pray ye for me}</B> <b><i>(\De&#275;th&#275;te humeis huper emou\)</i></b>. Emphasis on<br>
 \humeis\ <b><i>(you)</i></b>. First aorist passive imperative. Simon is<br>
 thoroughly frightened by Peter's words, but shows no sign of<br>
 personal repentance or change of heart. He wants to escape the<br>
 penalty for his sin and hopes that Peter can avert it. Peter had<br>
 clearly diagnosed his case. He was an unconverted man in spite of<br>
 his profession of faith and baptism. There is no evidence that he<br>
 ever changed his life at all. <B>{Which}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive by<br>
 attraction of the accusative relative \ha\ to case of the<br>
 unexpressed antecedent \tout&#333;n\ <b><i>(of those things)</i></b>, a common Greek<br>
 idiom.<br>
 <br>
 8:25 <B>{They therefore}</B> <b><i>(\hoi men oun\)</i></b>. Demonstrative \hoi\ with<br>
 \men\ <b><i>(no following \de\)</i></b> and the inferential \oun\ <b><i>(therefore)</i></b><br>
 as often in Acts <b><i>(<!-#-->1:6, etc.)</i></b>. <B>{Returned}</B> <b><i>(\hupestrephon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active picturing the joyful journey of preaching<br>
 <b><i>(\eu&#275;ggelizonto\, imperfect middle)</i></b> to the Samaritan villages.<br>
 Peter and John now carried on the work of Philip to the<br>
 Samaritans. This issue was closed.<br>
 <br>
 8:26 <B>{Toward the South}</B> <b><i>(\kata mes&#275;mbrian\)</i></b>. Old word from<br>
 \mesos\ and \h&#275;mera\, midday or noon as in <!-#-->Ac 22:16, the only<br>
 other example in the N.T. That may be the idea here also, though<br>
 "towards the South" gets support from the use of \kata liba\ in<br>
 <!-#-->Ac 27:12. <B>{The same is desert}</B> <b><i>(\haut&#275; estin er&#275;mos\)</i></b>. Probably<br>
 a parenthetical remark by Luke to give an idea of the way. One of<br>
 the ways actually goes through a desert. Gaza itself was a strong<br>
 city that resisted Alexander the Great five months. It was<br>
 destroyed by the Romans after war broke out with the Jews.<br>
 <br>
 8:27 <B>{A eunuch of great authority}</B> <b><i>(\eunouchos dunast&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Eunuchs were often employed by oriental rulers in high posts.<br>
 _Dynasty_ comes from this old word \dunast&#275;s\ used of princes in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 1:52 and of God in <!-#-->1Ti 6:15. Eunuchs were not allowed to<br>
 be Jews in the full sense <b><i>(<!-#-->De 23:1)</i></b>, but only proselytes of the<br>
 gate. But Christianity is spreading to Samaritans and to eunuchs.<br>
 <B>{Candace}</B> <b><i>(\Kandak&#275;s\)</i></b>. Not a personal name, but like Pharaoh and<br>
 Ptolemy, the title of the queens of Ethiopia. This eunuch<br>
 apparently brought the gospel to Ethiopia. <B>{Treasure}</B> <b><i>(\gaz&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Persian word, common in late Greek and Latin for the royal<br>
 treasure, here only in the N.T. <B>{For to worship}</B> <b><i>(\proskun&#275;s&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Future active participle expressing purpose, a common idiom in<br>
 the ancient Greek, but rare in the N.T. <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 1128)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:28 <B>{Was reading}</B> <b><i>(\anegin&#333;sken\)</i></b>. Imperfect active descriptive,<br>
 not periphrastic like the two preceding verbs <b><i>(was returning and<br>
 sitting)</i></b>. He was reading aloud as Philip "heard him reading"<br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;kousen auton anagin&#333;skontos\)</i></b>, a common practice among<br>
 orientals. He had probably purchased this roll of Isaiah in<br>
 Jerusalem and was reading the LXX Greek text. See imperfect again<br>
 in verse <!-#-->32.<br>
 <br>
 8:29 <B>{Join thyself}</B> <b><i>(\koll&#275;th&#275;ti\)</i></b>. See this vivid word <b><i>(be glued<br>
 to, first aorist passive imperative)</i></b> already in <!-#-->5:13; Lu 10:11;<br>
 15:15. Philip probably jumped on the running board on the side<br>
 of the chariot.<br>
 <br>
 8:30 <B>{Understandest thou what thou readest?}</B> <b><i>(\Ara ge gin&#333;skeis<br>
 ha anagin&#333;skeis?\)</i></b> The interrogative particle \ara\ and the<br>
 intensive particle \ge\ indicate doubt on Philip's part. The play<br>
 <b><i>(\paranomasia\)</i></b> upon the words in the Greek is very neat: <B>{Do you<br>
 know what you know again <b><i>(read)</i></b>?}</B> The verb for read<br>
 <b><i>(\anagin&#333;sko\)</i></b> means to know the letters again, recognize, read.<br>
 The famous comment of Julian about the Christian writings is<br>
 often quoted: \Anegn&#333;n, egn&#333;n, kategn&#333;n\ <b><i>(I read, I understood, I<br>
 condemned)</i></b>. The keen retort was: \Anegn&#333;s, all'ouk egn&#333;s, ei gar<br>
 egn&#333;s, ouk an kategn&#333;s\ <b><i>(You read, but did not understand; for if<br>
 you had understood, you would not have condemned)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:31 <B>{How can I, except some one shall guide me?}</B> <b><i>(\P&#333;s gar an<br>
 dunaim&#275;n ean me tis hod&#275;g&#275;sei me?\)</i></b>. This is a mixed condition,<br>
 the conclusion coming first belongs to the fourth class<br>
 <b><i>(undetermined with less likelihood of being determined)</i></b> with \an\<br>
 and the optative, but the condition <b><i>(\ean\, instead of the usual<br>
 \ei\, and the future indicative)</i></b> is of the first class<br>
 <b><i>(determined or fulfilled. Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1022)</i></b>, a<br>
 common enough phenomenon in the _Koin&#275;_. The eunuch felt the need<br>
 of some one to guide <b><i>(\hod&#275;ge&#333;\ from \hod&#275;gos\, guide, and that<br>
 from \hodos\, way, and \hegeomai\, to lead)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:32 <B>{The place}</B> <b><i>(\he perioch&#275;\)</i></b>. See the verb \periechei\ so<br>
 used in <!-#-->1Pe 2:6. The word is used either of the section as in<br>
 Codex A before the beginning of Mark or the contents of a<br>
 passage. He was here reading one particular passage <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa<br>
 53:7f.)</i></b>. The quotation is from the LXX which has some variations<br>
 from the Hebrew.<br>
 <br>
 8:33 <B>{Was taken away}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative<br>
 of \air&#333;\, to take away. It is not clear what the meaning is here<br>
 either in the Hebrew or the LXX. Knowling suggests that the idea<br>
 is that justice was withheld, done away with, in his death, as it<br>
 certainly was in the death of Christ.<br>
 <br>
 8:34 <B>{Of whom}</B> <b><i>(\peri tinos\)</i></b>. Concerning whom, a pertinent<br>
 inquiry surely and one that troubles many critics today.<br>
 <br>
 8:35 <B>{Beginning from this scripture}</B> <b><i>(\arxamenos apo t&#275;s graph&#275;s<br>
 taut&#275;s\)</i></b>. As a text. Philip needed no better opening than this<br>
 Messianic passage in Isaiah. <B>{Preached unto him Jesus}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eu&#275;ggelisato aut&#333;i ton I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. Philip had no doubt about the<br>
 Messianic meaning and he knew that Jesus was the Messiah. There<br>
 are scholars who do not find Jesus in the Old Testament at all,<br>
 but Jesus himself did <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:27)</i></b> as Philip does here.<br>
 Scientific study of the Old Testament <b><i>(historical research)</i></b><br>
 misses its mark if it fails to find Christ the Center of all<br>
 history. The knowledge of the individual prophet is not always<br>
 clear, but after events throw a backward light that illumines it<br>
 all <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 1:11f.; 2Pe 1:19-21)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:36 <B>{What doth hinder me to be baptized?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti k&#333;luei me<br>
 baptisth&#275;nai?\)</i></b>. Evidently Philip had said something about<br>
 baptism following faith and conversion. Verse <!-#-->37 is not a<br>
 genuine part of Acts, a western addition. Later baptismal<br>
 liturgies had it.<br>
 <br>
 8:39 <B>{Out of the water}</B> <b><i>(\ek tou hudatos\)</i></b>. Not from the edge of<br>
 the water, but up out of the water as in <!-#-->Mr 1:10. <B>{Caught away}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\h&#275;rpasen\)</i></b>. Suddenly and miraculously, for \harpaz&#333;\, like the<br>
 Latin _rapio_, means to carry off. Cf. <!-#-->2Co 12:2; 1Th 4:17.<br>
 <B>{Went on his way}</B> <b><i>(\eporeueto\)</i></b>. Kept on going, imperfect active.<br>
 <br>
 8:40 <B>{He preached the gospel}</B> <b><i>(\eu&#275;ggelizeto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle<br>
 describing the evangelistic tour of Philip "till he came to<br>
 Caesarea" <b><i>(\he&#333;s tou elthein auton\, genitive articular<br>
 infinitive with the preposition \he&#333;s\ and the accusative of<br>
 general reference)</i></b> where he made his home and headquarters<br>
 thereafter <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 21:28)</i></b> and was known as the Evangelist.<br>
