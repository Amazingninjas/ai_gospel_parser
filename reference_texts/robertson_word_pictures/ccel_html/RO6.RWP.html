<p>6:1 <B>{What shall we say then?}</B> <b><i>(\ti oun eroumen?\)</i></b>. "A debater's<br>
 phrase" <b><i>(Morison)</i></b>. Yes, and an echo of the rabbinical method of<br>
 question and answer, but also an expression of exultant victory<br>
 of grace versus sin. But Paul sees the possible perversion of<br>
 this glorious grace. <B>{Shall we continue in sin?}</B> <b><i>(\epimen&#333;men t&#275;i<br>
 hamarti&#257;i?\)</i></b>. Present active deliberative subjunctive of<br>
 \epimen&#333;\, old verb to tarry as in Ephesus <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 16:8)</i></b> with<br>
 locative case. The practice of sin as a habit <b><i>(present tense)</i></b> is<br>
 here raised. <B>{That grace may abound}</B> <b><i>(\hina h&#275; charis<br>
 pteonas&#275;i\)</i></b>. Final clause with ingressive aorist subjunctive, to<br>
 set free the superfluity of grace alluded to like putting money<br>
 in circulation. Horrible thought <b><i>(\m&#275; genoito\)</i></b> and yet Paul<br>
 faced it. There are occasionally so-called pietists who actually<br>
 think that God's pardon gives them liberty to sin without penalty<br>
 <b><i>(cf. the sale of indulgences that stirred Martin Luther)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:2 <B>{Died to sin}</B> <b><i>(\apethanomen t&#275;i hamarti&#257;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active of \apothn&#275;sk&#333;\ and the dative case. When we surrendered<br>
 to Christ and took him as Lord and Saviour. Qualitative relative<br>
 <b><i>(\hoitines\, we the very ones who)</i></b>. <B>{How}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;s\)</i></b>. Rhetorical<br>
 question.<br>
 <br>
 6:3 <B>{Were baptized into Christ}</B> <b><i>(\ebaptisth&#275;men eis Christon\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive indicative of \baptiz&#333;\. Better, "were<br>
 baptized unto Christ or in Christ." The translation "into" makes<br>
 Paul say that the union with Christ was brought to pass by means<br>
 of baptism, which is not his idea, for Paul was not a<br>
 sacramentarian. \Eis\ is at bottom the same word as \en\. Baptism<br>
 is the public proclamation of one's inward spiritual relation to<br>
 Christ attained before the baptism. See on &#175;Ga 3:27 where it is<br>
 like putting on an outward garment or uniform. <B>{Into his death}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eis ton thanaton autou\)</i></b>. So here "unto his death," "in<br>
 relation to his death," which relation Paul proceeds to explain<br>
 by the symbolism of the ordinance.<br>
 <br>
 6:4 <B>{We were buried therefore with him by means of baptism unto<br>
 death}</B> <b><i>(\sunetaph&#275;men oun aut&#333;i dia tou baptismatos eis ton<br>
 thanaton\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive indicative of \sunthapt&#333;\, old<br>
 verb to bury together with, in N.T. only here and <!-#-->Col 2:12.<br>
 With associative instrumental case <b><i>(\aut&#333;i\)</i></b> and "by means of<br>
 baptism unto death" as in verse <!-#-->3. <B>{In newness of life}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 kainot&#275;ti z&#333;&#275;s\)</i></b>. The picture in baptism points two ways,<br>
 backwards to Christ's death and burial and to our death to sin<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->1)</i></b>, forwards to Christ's resurrection from the dead and<br>
 to our new life pledged by the coming out of the watery grave to<br>
 walk on the other side of the baptismal grave <b><i>(F. B. Meyer)</i></b>.<br>
 There is the further picture of our own resurrection from the<br>
 grave. It is a tragedy that Paul's majestic picture here has been<br>
 so blurred by controversy that some refuse to see it. It should<br>
 be said also that a symbol is not the reality, but the picture of<br>
 the reality.<br>
 <br>
 6:5 <B>{For if we have become united with him by the likeness of his<br>
 death}</B> <b><i>(\ei gar sumphutoi gegonamen t&#333;i homoi&#333;mati tou thanatou<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. Condition of the first class, assumed to be true.<br>
 \Sumphutoi\ is old verbal adjective from \sumphu&#333;\, to grow<br>
 together. Baptism as a picture of death and burial symbolizes our<br>
 likeness to Christ in his death. <B>{We shall be also united in the<br>
 likeness of his resurrection}</B> <b><i>(\alla kai t&#275;s anastase&#333;s<br>
 esometha\)</i></b>. The conclusion to the previous condition introduced<br>
 by \alla kai\ as often and \toi homoi&#333;mati\ <b><i>(in the likeness)</i></b><br>
 must be understood before \t&#275;s anastase&#333;s\ <b><i>(of his resurrection)</i></b>.<br>
 Baptism is a picture of the past and of the present and a<br>
 prophecy of the future, the matchless preacher of the new life in<br>
 Christ.<br>
 <br>
 6:6 <B>{Our old man}</B> <b><i>(\ho palaios h&#275;m&#333;n anthr&#333;pos\)</i></b>. Only in Paul<br>
 <b><i>(here, <!-#-->Col 3:9; Eph 4:22)</i></b>. <B>{Was crucified with him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sunestaur&#333;th&#275;\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Ga 2:19 for this boldly picturesque<br>
 word. This took place not at baptism, but only pictured there. It<br>
 took place when "we died to sin" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->1)</i></b>. <B>{The body of sin}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\to s&#333;ma t&#275;s hamartias\)</i></b>. "The body of which sin has taken<br>
 possession" <b><i>(Sanday and Headlam)</i></b>, the body marked by sin. <B>{That<br>
 so we should no longer be in bondage to sin}</B> <b><i>(\tou m&#275;keti<br>
 douleuein h&#275;mas t&#275;i hamarti&#257;i\)</i></b>. Purpose clause with \tou\ and<br>
 the present active infinitive of \douleu&#333;\, continue serving sin<br>
 <b><i>(as slaves)</i></b>. Adds "slavery" to living in sin <b><i>(verse <!-#-->2)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:7 <B>{Is justified}</B> <b><i>(\dedikai&#333;tai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative of<br>
 \dikaio&#333;\, stands justified, set free from, adding this great<br>
 word to death and life of verses <!-#-->1,2.<br>
 <br>
 6:8 <B>{With Christ}</B> <b><i>(\sun Christ&#333;i\)</i></b>. As pictured by baptism, the<br>
 crucifixion with Christ of verse <!-#-->6.<br>
 <br>
 6:9 <B>{Dieth no more}</B> <b><i>(\ouketi apothn&#275;skei\)</i></b>. "Christ's particular<br>
 death occurs but once" <b><i>(Shedd)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Heb 10:10. A complete<br>
 refutation of the "sacrificial" character of the "mass."<br>
 <br>
 6:10 <B>{The death that he died}</B> <b><i>(\ho apethanen\)</i></b>. Neuter relative,<br>
 cognative accusative with \apethanen\. <B>{Once}</B> <b><i>(\ephapax\)</i></b>. Once<br>
 and once only <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 9:26f.)</i></b>, not \pote\ <b><i>(once upon a time)</i></b>. <B>{The<br>
 life that he liveth}</B> <b><i>(\ho z&#275;i\)</i></b>. Cognate accusative of the<br>
 relative.<br>
 <br>
 6:11 <B>{Reckon ye also yourselves}</B> <b><i>(\kai humeis logizesthe\)</i></b>.<br>
 Direct middle imperative of \logizomai\ and complete proof that<br>
 Paul does not mean that baptism makes one dead to sin and alive<br>
 to God. That is a spiritual operation "in Christ Jesus" and only<br>
 pictured by baptism. This is a plea to live up to the ideal of<br>
 the baptized life.<br>
 <br>
 6:12 <B>{Reign}</B> <b><i>(\basileuet&#333;\)</i></b>. Present active imperative, "let not<br>
 sin continue to reign" as it did once <b><i>(<!-#-->5:12)</i></b>. <B>{Mortal}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\thn&#275;toi\)</i></b>. Verbal adjective from \thn&#275;sk&#333;\, subject to death.<br>
 The reign of sin is over with you. Self-indulgence is<br>
 inconsistent with trust in the vicarious atonement. <B>{That ye<br>
 should obey}</B> <b><i>(\eis to hupakouein\)</i></b>. With a view to obeying.<br>
 <br>
 6:13 <B>{Neither present}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;de paristanete\)</i></b>. Present active<br>
 imperative in prohibition of \paristan&#333;\, late form of<br>
 \parist&#275;mi\, to place beside. Stop presenting your members or do<br>
 not have the habit of doing so, "do not go on putting your<br>
 members to sin as weapons of unrighteousness." <B>{Instruments}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hopla\)</i></b>. Old word for tools of any kind for shop or war <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 18:3; 2Co 6:7; 10:4; Ro 13:12)</i></b>. Possibly here figure of two<br>
 armies arrayed against each other <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 5:16-24)</i></b>, and see \hopla<br>
 dikaiosun&#275;s\ below. The two sets of \hopla\ clash. <B>{But present<br>
 yourselves unto God}</B> <b><i>(\alla parast&#275;sate heautous t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active imperative of \parist&#275;mi\, same verb, but<br>
 different tense, do it now and completely. Our "members" <b><i>(\mel&#275;\)</i></b><br>
 should be at the call of God "as alive from the dead."<br>
 <br>
 6:14 <B>{Shall not have dominion}</B> <b><i>(\ou kurieusei\)</i></b>. Future active<br>
 indicative of \kurieu&#333;\, old verb from \kurios\, "shall not lord<br>
 it over you," even if not yet wholly dead. Cf. <!-#-->2Co 1:24.<br>
 <br>
 6:15 <B>{What then?}</B> <b><i>(\ti oun?\)</i></b>. Another turn in the argument about<br>
 the excess of grace. <B>{Shall we sin?}</B> <b><i>(\hamartes&#333;men?\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active deliberative subjunctive of \hamartan&#333;\. "Shall we<br>
 commit sin" <b><i>(occasional acts of sin as opposed to the life of sin<br>
 as raised by \epimen&#333;men t&#275;i hamarti&#257;i\ in verse <!-#-->1)</i></b>? <B>{Because}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hoti\)</i></b>. The same reason as in verse <!-#-->1 and taken up from the<br>
 very words in verse <!-#-->14. Surely, the objector says, we may take<br>
 a night off now and then and sin a little bit "since we are under<br>
 grace."<br>
 <br>
 6:16 <B>{His servants ye are whom ye obey}</B> <b><i>(\douloi este h&#333;i<br>
 hupakouete\)</i></b>. Bondservants, slaves of the one whom ye obey,<br>
 whatever one's profession may be, traitors, spies sometimes they<br>
 are called. As Paul used the figure to illustrate death to sin<br>
 and resurrection to new life in Christ and not in sin, so now he<br>
 uses slavery against the idea of occasional lapses into sin.<br>
 Loyalty to Christ will not permit occasional crossing over to the<br>
 other side to Satan's line.<br>
 <br>
 6:17 <B>{Whereas ye were}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;te\)</i></b>. Imperfect but no "whereas" in the<br>
 Greek. Paul is not grateful that they were once slaves of sin,<br>
 but only that, though they once were, they turned from that<br>
 state. <B>{To that form of doctrine whereunto ye were delivered}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eis hon paredoth&#275;te tupon didach&#275;s\)</i></b>. Incorporation of the<br>
 antecedent <b><i>(\tupon didach&#275;s\)</i></b> into the relative clause: "to which<br>
 form of doctrine ye were delivered." See on &#175;5:14 for \tupon\.<br>
 It is hardly proper to take "form" here to refer to Paul's gospel<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2:16)</i></b>, possibly an allusion to the symbolism of baptism which<br>
 was the outward sign of the separation.<br>
 <br>
 6:18 <B>{Ye became servants of righteousness}</B> <b><i>(\edoul&#333;th&#275;te t&#275;i<br>
 dikaiosun&#275;i\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of \doulo&#333;\, to<br>
 enslave. "Ye were made slaves to righteousness." You have simply<br>
 changed masters, no longer slaves of sin <b><i>(set free from that<br>
 tyrant)</i></b>, but ye are slaves of righteousness. There is no middle<br>
 ground, no "no man's land" in this war.<br>
 <br>
 6:19 <B>{I speak after the manner of men}</B> <b><i>(\anthr&#333;pinon leg&#333;\)</i></b>. "I<br>
 speak a human word." He begs pardon for using "slaving" in<br>
 connection with righteousness. But it is a good word, especially<br>
 for our times when self-assertiveness and personal liberty bulk<br>
 so large in modern speech. See <!-#-->3:5; Ga 3:15 where he uses \kata<br>
 anthr&#333;pon\. <B>{Because of the infirmity of your flesh}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#275;n<br>
 astheneian t&#275;s sarkos hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Because of defective spiritual<br>
 insight largely due to moral defects also. <B>{Servants to<br>
 uncleanness}</B> <b><i>(\doula t&#275;i akatharsi&#257;i\)</i></b>. Neuter plural form of<br>
 \doulos\ to agree with \mel&#275;\ <b><i>(members)</i></b>. Patently true in sexual<br>
 sins, in drunkenness, and all fleshly sins, absolutely slaves<br>
 like narcotic fiends. <B>{So now}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s nun\)</i></b>. Now that you are<br>
 born again in Christ. Paul uses twice again the same verb<br>
 \parist&#275;mi\, to present <b><i>(\parest&#275;sate, parast&#275;sate\)</i></b>. <B>{Servants<br>
 to righteousness}</B> <b><i>(\doula t&#275;i dikaiosun&#275;i\)</i></b>. Repeats the idea of<br>
 verse <!-#-->18. <B>{Unto sanctification}</B> <b><i>(\eis hagiasmon\)</i></b>. This the<br>
 goal, the blessed consummation that demands and deserves the new<br>
 slavery without occasional lapses or sprees <b><i>(verse <!-#-->15)</i></b>. This<br>
 late word appears only in LXX, N.T., and ecclesiastical writers<br>
 so far. See on <!-#-->1Th 4:3; 1Co 1:30. Paul includes sanctification<br>
 in his conception of the God-kind <b><i>(<!-#-->1:17)</i></b> of righteousness <b><i>(both<br>
 justification, <!-#-->1:18-5:21 and sanctification, chapters <!-#-->6-8)</i></b>.<br>
 It is a life process of consecration, not an instantaneous act.<br>
 Paul shows that we ought to be sanctified <b><i>(<!-#-->6:1-7:6)</i></b> and<br>
 illustrates the obligation by death <b><i>(<!-#-->6:1-14)</i></b>, by slavery<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->6:15-23)</i></b>, and by marriage <b><i>(<!-#-->7:1-6)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:20 <B>{Free in regard of righteousness}</B> <b><i>(\eleutheroi t&#275;i<br>
 dikaiosun&#275;i\)</i></b>. Ye wore no collar of righteousness, but freely did<br>
 as ye pleased. They were "free." Note dative case, personal<br>
 relation, of \dikaiosun&#275;i\.<br>
 <br>
 6:21 <B>{What fruit then had ye at that time?}</B> <b><i>(\tina oun karpon<br>
 eichete tote?\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, used to have. A pertinent<br>
 question. Ashes in their hands now. They are ashamed now of the<br>
 memory of them. The end of them is death.<br>
 <br>
 6:22 <B>{Ye have your fruit unto sanctification}</B> <b><i>(\echete ton karpon<br>
 hum&#333;n eis hagiasmon\)</i></b>. Freedom from sin and slavery to God bring<br>
 permanent fruit that leads to sanctification. <B>{And the end<br>
 eternal life}</B> <b><i>(\to de telos z&#333;&#275;n ai&#333;nion\)</i></b>. Note accusative case<br>
 \z&#333;&#275;n ai&#333;nion\, object of \echete\ <b><i>(ye have)</i></b>, though \thanatos\<br>
 in contrast above is nominative.<br>
 <br>
 6:23 <B>{Wages}</B> <b><i>(\ops&#333;nia\)</i></b>. Late Greek for wages of soldier, here<br>
 of sin. See on &#175;Lu 3:14; 1Co 9:7; 2Co 11:8. Sin pays its wages<br>
 in full with no cut. But eternal life is God's gift <b><i>(\charisma\)</i></b>,<br>
 not wages. Both \thanatos\ and \z&#333;&#275;n\ are <B>{eternal}</B> <b><i>(\ai&#333;nion\)</i></b>.<br>
