<p>4:1 <B>{To be tempted of the devil}</B> <b><i>(\peirasth&#275;nai hupo tou<br>
 diabolou\)</i></b>. Matthew locates the temptation at a definite time,<br>
 "then" <b><i>(\tote\)</i></b> and place, "into the wilderness" <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n<br>
 er&#275;mon\)</i></b>, the same general region where John was preaching. It is<br>
 not surprising that Jesus was tempted by the devil immediately<br>
 after his baptism which signified the formal entrance upon the<br>
 Messianic work. That is a common experience with ministers who<br>
 step out into the open for Christ. The difficulty here is that<br>
 Matthew says that "Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the<br>
 Spirit to be tempted by the devil." Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:12)</i></b> puts it more<br>
 strongly that the Spirit "drives" <b><i>(\ekballei\)</i></b> Christ into the<br>
 wilderness. It was a strong impulsion by the Holy Spirit that led<br>
 Jesus into the wilderness to think through the full significance<br>
 of the great step that he had now taken. That step opened the<br>
 door for the devil and involved inevitable conflict with the<br>
 slanderer <b><i>(\tou diabolou\)</i></b>. Judas has this term applied to him<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:70)</i></b> as it is to men <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 3:3; Tit 2:3)</i></b> and women <b><i>(she<br>
 devils, <!-#-->1Ti 3:11)</i></b> who do the work of the arch slanderer. There<br>
 are those today who do not believe that a personal devil exists,<br>
 but they do not offer an adequate explanation of the existence<br>
 and presence of sin in the world. Certainly Jesus did not<br>
 discount or deny the reality of the devil's presence. The word<br>
 "tempt" here <b><i>(\peiraz&#333;\)</i></b> and in <!-#-->4:3 means originally to test,<br>
 to try. That is its usual meaning in the ancient Greek and in the<br>
 Septuagint. Bad sense of \ekpeiraz&#333;\ in <!-#-->4:7 as in <!-#-->De 6:16.<br>
 Here it comes to mean, as often in the New Testament, to solicit<br>
 to sin. The evil sense comes from its use for an evil purpose.<br>
 <br>
 4:2 <B>{Had fasted}</B> <b><i>(\n&#275;steusas\)</i></b>.  No perfunctory ceremonial fast,<br>
 but of communion with the Father in complete abstention from food<br>
 as in the case of Moses during forty days and forty nights <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex<br>
 34:28)</i></b>. "The period of the fast, as in the case of Moses was<br>
 spent in a spiritual ecstasy, during which the wants of the<br>
 natural body were suspended" <b><i>(Alford)</i></b>. "He afterward hungered"<br>
 and so at the close of the period of forty days.<br>
 <br>
 4:3 <B>{If thou art the Son of God}</B> <b><i>(\ei huios ei tou theou\)</i></b>. More<br>
 exactly, "If thou art Son of God," for there is no article with<br>
 "Son." The devil is alluding to the words of the Father to Jesus<br>
 at the baptism: "This is my Son the Beloved." He challenges this<br>
 address by a condition of the first class which assumes the<br>
 condition to be true and deftly calls on Jesus to exercise his<br>
 power as Son of God to appease his hunger and thus prove to<br>
 himself and all that he really is what the Father called him.<br>
 <B>{Become bread}</B> <b><i>(\artoi gen&#333;ntai\)</i></b>. Literally, "that these stones<br>
 <b><i>(round smooth stones which possibly the devil pointed to or even<br>
 picked up and held)</i></b> become loaves" <b><i>(each stone a loaf)</i></b>. It was<br>
 all so simple, obvious, easy. It would satisfy the hunger of<br>
 Christ and was quite within his power. <B>{It is written}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\gegraptai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative, stands written and is<br>
 still in force. Each time Jesus quotes Deuteronomy to repel the<br>
 subtle temptation of the devil. Here it is <!-#-->De 8:3 from the<br>
 Septuagint. Bread is a mere detail <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b> in man's dependence<br>
 upon God.<br>
 <br>
 4:5 <B>{Then the devil taketh him}</B> <b><i>(\tote paralambanei auton ho<br>
 diabolos\)</i></b>. Matthew is very fond of this temporal adverb<br>
 <b><i>(\tote\)</i></b>. See already <!-#-->2:7; 3:13; 4:1,5. Note historic present<br>
 with vivid picturesqueness. Luke puts this temptation third, the<br>
 geographical order. But was the person of Christ allowed to be at<br>
 the disposal of the devil during these temptations? Alford so<br>
 holds. <B>{On the pinnacle of the temple}</B> <b><i>(\epi to pterugion tou<br>
 hierou\)</i></b>. Literally "wing:" the English word "pinnacle" is from<br>
 the Latin _pinnaculum_, a diminutive of _pinna_ <b><i>(wing)</i></b>. "_The<br>
 temple_" <b><i>(\tou hierou\)</i></b> here includes the whole temple area, not<br>
 just the sanctuary <b><i>(\ho naos\)</i></b>, the Holy Place and Most Holy<br>
 Place. It is not clear what place is meant by "wing." It may<br>
 refer to Herod's royal portico which overhung the Kedron Valley<br>
 and looked down some four hundred and fifty feet, a dizzy height<br>
 <b><i>(Josephus, _Ant_. XV. xi. 5)</i></b>. This was on the south of the temple<br>
 court. Hegesippus says that James the Lord's brother was later<br>
 placed on the wing of the temple and thrown down therefrom.<br>
 <br>
 4:6 <B>{Cast thyself down}</B> <b><i>(\bale seauton kat&#333;\)</i></b>. The appeal to hurl<br>
 himself down into the abyss below would intensify the nervous<br>
 dread that most people feel at such a height. The devil urged<br>
 presumptuous reliance on God and quotes Scripture to support his<br>
 view <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps 91:11f.)</i></b>. So the devil quotes the Word of God,<br>
 misinterprets it, omits a clause, and tries to trip the Son of<br>
 God by the Word of God. It was a skilful thrust and would also be<br>
 accepted by the populace as proof that Jesus was the Messiah if<br>
 they should see him sailing down as if from heaven. This would be<br>
 a sign from heaven in accord with popular Messianic expectation.<br>
 The promise of the angels the devil thought would reassure Jesus.<br>
 They would be a spiritual parachute for Christ.<br>
 <br>
 4:7 <B>{Thou shall not tempt}</B> <b><i>(\ouk ekpeiraseis\)</i></b>. Jesus quotes<br>
 Deuteronomy again <b><i>(<!-#-->De 6:16)</i></b> and shows that the devil has wholly<br>
 misapplied God's promise of protection.<br>
 <br>
 4:8 <B>{And showeth him}</B> <b><i>(\kai deiknusin aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. This wonderful<br>
 panorama had to be partially mental and imaginative, since the<br>
 devil caused to pass in review "all the kingdoms of the world and<br>
 the glory of them." But this fact does not prove that all phases<br>
 of the temptations were subjective without any objective presence<br>
 of the devil. Both could be true. Here again we have the vivid<br>
 historical present <b><i>(\deiknusin\)</i></b>. The devil now has Christ upon a<br>
 very high mountain whether the traditional Quarantania or not. It<br>
 was from Nebo's summit that Moses caught the vision of the land<br>
 of Canaan <b><i>(<!-#-->De 34:1-3)</i></b>. Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 4:5)</i></b> says that the whole<br>
 panorama was "in a moment of time" and clearly psychological and<br>
 instantaneous.<br>
 <br>
 4:9 <B>{All these things will I give thee}</B> <b><i>(\tauta soi panta d&#333;s&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 The devil claims the rule of the world, not merely of Palestine<br>
 or of the Roman Empire. "The kingdoms of the cosmos" <b><i>(<!-#-->4:8)</i></b> were<br>
 under his sway. This word for world brings out the orderly<br>
 arrangement of the universe while \h&#275; oikoumen&#275;\ presents the<br>
 inhabited earth. Jesus does not deny the grip of the devil on the<br>
 world of men, but the condition <b><i>(\ean\ and aorist subjunctive,<br>
 second class undetermined with likelihood of determination)</i></b>, was<br>
 spurned by Jesus. As Matthew has it Jesus is plainly to "fall<br>
 down and worship me" <b><i>(\pes&#333;n prokun&#275;s&#275;is moi\)</i></b>, while Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 4:7)</i></b> puts it, "worship before me" <b><i>(\en&#333;pion emou\)</i></b>, a less<br>
 offensive demand, but one that really involved worship of the<br>
 devil. The ambition of Jesus is thus appealed to at the price of<br>
 recognition of the devil's primacy in the world. It was<br>
 compromise that involved surrender of the Son of God to the world<br>
 ruler of this darkness. "The temptation was threefold: to gain a<br>
 temporal, not a spiritual, dominion; to gain it at once; and to<br>
 gain it by an act of homage to the ruler of this world, which<br>
 would make the self-constituted Messiah the vice-regent of the<br>
 devil and not of God" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:10 <B>{Get thee hence, Satan}</B> <b><i>(\Hupage, Satan&#257;\)</i></b>. The words<br>
 "behind me" <b><i>(\opis&#333; mou\)</i></b> belong to <!-#-->Mt 16:23, not here.<br>
 "Begone" Christ says to Satan. This temptation is the limit of<br>
 diabolical suggestion and argues for the logical order in<br>
 Matthew. "Satan" means the adversary and Christ so terms the<br>
 devil here. The third time Jesus quotes Deuteronomy, this time<br>
 <!-#-->De 6:13, and repels the infamous suggestion by Scripture<br>
 quotation. The words "him alone thou shalt serve" need be<br>
 recalled today. Jesus will warn men against trying to serve God<br>
 and mammon <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 6:24)</i></b>. The devil as the lord of the evil world<br>
 constantly tries to win men to the service of the world and God.<br>
 This is his chief camouflage for destroying a preacher's power<br>
 for God. The word here in <!-#-->Mt 4:10 for serve is \latreuseis\<br>
 from \latris\ a hired servant, one who works for hire, then<br>
 render worship.<br>
 <br>
 4:11 <B>{Then the devil leaveth him}</B> <b><i>(\tote aphi&#275;sin auton ho<br>
 diabolos\)</i></b>. Note the use of "then" <b><i>(\tote\)</i></b> again and the<br>
 historical present. The movement is swift. "And behold" <b><i>(\kai<br>
 idou\)</i></b> as so often in Matthew carries on the life-like picture.<br>
 "<B>{Angels came}</B> <b><i>(aorist tense \pros&#275;lthon\ punctiliar action)</i></b> <B>{and<br>
 were ministering}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;konoun\, picturesque imperfect, linear<br>
 action)</i></b> <B>{unto him}</B>."  The victory was won in spite of the fast of<br>
 forty days and the repeated onsets of the devil who had tried<br>
 every avenue of approach. The angels could cheer him in the<br>
 inevitable nervous and spiritual reaction from the strain of<br>
 conflict, and probably also with food as in the case of Elijah<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ki 19:6f.)</i></b>. The issues at stake were of vast import as the<br>
 champions of light and darkness grappled for the mastery of men.<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 4:13 adds, that the devil left Jesus only "until a good<br>
 opportunity" <b><i>(\achri kairou\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:12 <B>{Now when he heard}</B> <b><i>(\akousas de\)</i></b>. The reason for Christ's<br>
 return to Galilee is given here to be that John had been<br>
 delivered up into prison. The Synoptic Gospels skip from the<br>
 temptation of Jesus to the Galilean ministry, a whole year. But<br>
 for <!-#-->Joh 1:19-3:36 we should know nothing of the "year of<br>
 obscurity" <b><i>(Stalker)</i></b>. John supplies items to help fill in the<br>
 picture. Christ's work in Galilee began after the close of the<br>
 active ministry of the Baptist who lingered on in prison for a<br>
 year or more.<br>
 <br>
 4:13 <B>{Dwelt in Capernaum}</B> <b><i>(\Kat&#333;ik&#275;sen eis Kapharnaoum\)</i></b>. He went<br>
 first to Nazareth, his old home, but was rejected there <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 4:16-31)</i></b>. In Capernaum <b><i>(probably the modern \Tell H&#8211;m\)</i></b> Jesus<br>
 was in a large town, one of the centres of Galilean political and<br>
 commercial life, a fishing mart, where many Gentiles came. Here<br>
 the message of the kingdom would have a better chance than in<br>
 Jerusalem with its ecclesiastical prejudices or in Nazareth with<br>
 its local jealousies. So Jesus "made his home" <b><i>(\kat&#333;ik&#275;sen\)</i></b><br>
 here.<br>
 <br>
 4:16 <B>{Saw a great light}</B> <b><i>(\ph&#333;s eiden mega\)</i></b>. Matthew quotes <!-#-->Isa<br>
 9:1f., and applies the words about the deliverer from Assyria to<br>
 the Messiah. "The same district lay in spiritual darkness and<br>
 death and the new era dawned when Christ went thither" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 Light sprang up from those who were sitting in the region and<br>
 shadow of death <b><i>(\en chor&#257;i kai ski&#257;i thanatou\)</i></b>. Death is<br>
 personified.<br>
 <br>
 4:17 <B>{Began Jesus to preach}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rxato ho I&#275;sous k&#275;russein\)</i></b>. In<br>
 Galilee. He had been preaching for over a year already elsewhere.<br>
 His message carries on the words of the Baptist about<br>
 "repentance" and the "kingdom of heaven" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 3:2)</i></b> being at<br>
 hand. The same word for "preaching" <b><i>(\k&#275;russein\)</i></b> from \k&#275;rux\,<br>
 herald, is used of Jesus as of John. Both proclaimed the good<br>
 news of the kingdom. Jesus is more usually described as the<br>
 Teacher, <b><i>(\ho didaskalos\)</i></b> who taught <b><i>(\edidasken\)</i></b> the people.<br>
 He was both herald and teacher as every preacher should be.<br>
 <br>
 4:18 <B>{Casting a net into the sea}</B> <b><i>(\ballantas amphibl&#275;stron eis<br>
 t&#275;n thalassan\)</i></b>. The word here for net is a casting-net <b><i>(compare<br>
 \amphiball&#333;\ in <!-#-->Mr 1:16, casting on both sides)</i></b>. The net was<br>
 thrown over the shoulder and spread into a circle <b><i>(\amphi\)</i></b>. In<br>
 <!-#-->4:20 and <!-#-->4:21 another word occurs for nets <b><i>(\diktua\)</i></b>, a word<br>
 used for nets of any kind. The large drag-net <b><i>(\sag&#275;n&#275;\)</i></b> appears<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 13:47.<br>
 <br>
 4:19 <B>{Fishers of men}</B> <b><i>(\haleeis anthr&#333;p&#333;n\)</i></b>. Andrew and Simon<br>
 were fishers by trade. They had already become disciples of Jesus<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:35-42)</i></b>, but now they are called upon to leave their<br>
 business and to follow Jesus in his travels and work. These two<br>
 brothers promptly <b><i>(\euthe&#333;s\)</i></b> accepted the call and challenge of<br>
 Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 4:21 <B>{Mending their nets}</B> <b><i>(\katartizontas ta diktua aut&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 These two brothers, James and John, were getting their nets ready<br>
 for use. The verb <b><i>(\katartiz&#333;\)</i></b> means to adjust, to articulate,<br>
 to mend if needed <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:40; Ro 9:22; Ga 6:1)</i></b>. So they promptly<br>
 left their boat and father and followed Jesus. They had also<br>
 already become disciples of Jesus. Now there are four who follow<br>
 him steadily.<br>
 <br>
 4:23 <B>{Went about in all Galilee}</B> <b><i>(\peri&#275;gen en hol&#275;i t&#275;i<br>
 Galilaiai\)</i></b>. Literally Jesus "was going around <b><i>(imperfect)</i></b> in all<br>
 Galilee." This is the first of the three tours of Galilee made by<br>
 Jesus. This time he took the four fishermen whom he had just<br>
 called to personal service. The second time he took the twelve.<br>
 On the third he sent the twelve on ahead by twos and followed<br>
 after them. He was teaching and preaching the gospel of the<br>
 kingdom in the synagogues chiefly and on the roads and in the<br>
 streets where Gentiles could hear. <B>{Healing all manner of<br>
 diseases and all manner of sickness}</B> <b><i>(\therapeu&#333;n p&#257;san noson kai<br>
 p&#257;san malakian\)</i></b>. The occasional sickness is called \malakian\,<br>
 the chronic or serious disease \noson\.<br>
 <br>
 4:24 <B>{The report of him went forth into all Syria}</B> <b><i>(\ap&#275;lthen h&#275;<br>
 ako&#275; autou eis hol&#275;n t&#275;n Syrian\)</i></b>. Rumour <b><i>(\ako&#275;\)</i></b> carries things<br>
 almost like the wireless or radio. The Gentiles all over Syria to<br>
 the north heard of what was going on in Galilee. The result was<br>
 inevitable. Jesus had a moving hospital of patients from all over<br>
 Galilee and Syria. "<B>{Those that were sick}</B>" <b><i>(\tous kak&#333;s<br>
 echontas\)</i></b>, literally "those who had it bad," cases that the<br>
 doctors could not cure. "<B>{Holden with divers diseases and<br>
 torments}</B>" <b><i>(\poikilais nosois kai basanois sunechomenous\)</i></b>. "Held<br>
 together" or "compressed" is the idea of the participle. The same<br>
 word is used by Jesus in <!-#-->Lu 12:50 and by Paul in <!-#-->Php 1:23 and<br>
 of the crowd pressing on Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:45)</i></b>. They brought these<br>
 difficult and chronic cases <b><i>(present tense of the participle<br>
 here)</i></b> to Jesus. Instead of "divers" say "various" <b><i>(\poikilais\)</i></b><br>
 like fever, leprosy, blindness. The adjective means literally<br>
 many colored or variegated like flowers, paintings, jaundice,<br>
 etc. Some had "torments" <b><i>(\basanois\)</i></b>. The word originally<br>
 <b><i>(oriental origin)</i></b> meant a touchstone, "Lydian stone" used for<br>
 testing gold because pure gold rubbed on it left a peculiar mark.<br>
 Then it was used for examination by torture. Sickness was often<br>
 regarded as "torture." These diseases are further described "in a<br>
 descending scale of violence" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b> as "demoniacs, lunatics,<br>
 and paralytics" as Moffatt puts it, "demoniacs, epileptics,<br>
 paralytics" as Weymouth has it, <b><i>(\daimonizomenous kai<br>
 sel&#275;niazomenous kai paralutikous\)</i></b>, people possessed by demons,<br>
 lunatics or "moon-struck" because the epileptic seizures<br>
 supposedly followed the phases of the moon <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b> as shown also<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 17:15, paralytics <b><i>(our very word)</i></b>. Our word "lunatic" is<br>
 from the Latin _luna_ <b><i>(moon)</i></b> and carries the same picture as the<br>
 Greek \sel&#275;niazomai\ from \sel&#275;n&#275;\ <b><i>(moon)</i></b>. These diseases are<br>
 called "torments."<br>
 <br>
 4:25 <B>{Great multitudes}</B> <b><i>(\ochloi polloi\)</i></b>.  Note the plural, not<br>
 just one crowd, but crowds and crowds. And from all parts of<br>
 Palestine including Decapolis, the region of the Ten Greek Cities<br>
 east of the Jordan. No political campaign was equal to this<br>
 outpouring of the people to hear Jesus and to be healed by Jesus.<br>
