<p>5:1 <B>{He went up into the mountain}</B> <b><i>(\aneb&#275; eis to oros\)</i></b>. Not "a"<br>
 mountain as the Authorized Version has it. The Greek article is<br>
 poorly handled in most English versions. We do not know what<br>
 mountain it was. It was the one there where Jesus and the crowds<br>
 were. "Delitzsch calls the Mount of Beatitudes the Sinai of the<br>
 New Testament" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. He apparently went up to get in closer<br>
 contact with the disciples, "seeing the multitudes." Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 6:12)</i></b> says that he went out into the mountain to pray, Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 3:13)</i></b> that he went up and called the twelve. All three purposes<br>
 are true. Luke adds that after a whole night in prayer and after<br>
 the choice of the twelve Jesus came down to a level place on the<br>
 mountain and spoke to the multitudes from Judea to Phoenicia. The<br>
 crowds are great in both Matthew and in Luke and include<br>
 disciples and the other crowds. There is no real difficulty in<br>
 considering the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew and the Sermon on<br>
 the Plain in Luke as one and the same. See full discussion in my<br>
 _Harmony of the Gospels_.<br>
 <br>
 5:2 <B>{Taught them}</B> <b><i>(\edidasken\)</i></b>. Inchoative imperfect, began to<br>
 teach. He sat down on the mountain side as the Jewish rabbis did<br>
 instead of standing. It was a most impressive scene as Jesus<br>
 opened his mouth wide and spoke loud enough for the great throng<br>
 to hear him. The newly chosen twelve apostles were there, "a<br>
 great number of disciples and a great number of the people" <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 6:17)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:3 <B>{Blessed}</B> <b><i>(\makarioi\)</i></b>. The English word "blessed" is more<br>
 exactly represented by the Greek verbal \eulog&#275;toi\ as in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 1:68 of God by Zacharias, or the perfect passive participle<br>
 \eulog&#275;menos\ as in <!-#-->Lu 1:42 of Mary by Elizabeth and in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 21:9. Both forms come from \euloge&#333;\, to speak well of <b><i>(\eu,<br>
 logos\)</i></b>. The Greek word here <b><i>(\makarioi\)</i></b> is an adjective that<br>
 means "happy" which in English etymology goes back to hap,<br>
 chance, good-luck as seen in our words haply, hapless, happily,<br>
 happiness. "Blessedness is, of course, an infinitely higher and<br>
 better thing than mere happiness" <b><i>(Weymouth)</i></b>. English has thus<br>
 ennobled "blessed" to a higher rank than "happy." But "happy" is<br>
 what Jesus said and the _Braid Scots New Testament_ dares to say<br>
 "Happy" each time here as does the _Improved Edition of the<br>
 American Bible Union Version_. The Greek word is as old as Homer<br>
 and Pindar and was used of the Greek gods and also of men, but<br>
 largely of outward prosperity. Then it is applied to the dead who<br>
 died in the Lord as in <!-#-->Re 14:13. Already in the Old Testament<br>
 the Septuagint uses it of moral quality. "Shaking itself loose<br>
 from all thoughts of outward good, it becomes the express symbol<br>
 of a happiness identified with pure character. Behind it lies the<br>
 clear cognition of sin as the fountain-head of all misery, and of<br>
 holiness as the final and effectual cure for every woe. For<br>
 knowledge as the basis of virtue, and therefore of happiness, it<br>
 substitutes faith and love" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. Jesus takes this word<br>
 "happy" and puts it in this rich environment. "This is one of the<br>
 words which have been transformed and ennobled by New Testament<br>
 use; by association, as in the Beatitudes, with unusual<br>
 conditions, accounted by the world miserable, or with rare and<br>
 difficult" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. It is a pity that we have not kept the word<br>
 "happy" to the high and holy plane where Jesus placed it. "If you<br>
 know these things, happy <b><i>(\makarioi\)</i></b> are you if you do them"<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 13:17)</i></b>. "Happy <b><i>(\makarioi\)</i></b> are those who have not seen<br>
 and yet have believed" <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 20:29)</i></b>. And Paul applies this<br>
 adjective to God, "according to the gospel of the glory of the<br>
 happy <b><i>(\makariou\)</i></b> God" <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 1:11. Cf. also <!-#-->Tit 2:13)</i></b>. The<br>
 term "Beatitudes" <b><i>(Latin _beatus_)</i></b> comes close to the meaning of<br>
 Christ here by \makarioi\. It will repay one to make a careful<br>
 study of all the "beatitudes" in the New Testament where this<br>
 word is employed. It occurs nine times here <b><i>(<!-#-->3-11)</i></b>, though the<br>
 beatitudes in verses 10 and 11 are very much alike. The copula is<br>
 not expressed in either of these nine beatitudes. In each case a<br>
 reason is given for the beatitude, "for" <b><i>(\hoti\)</i></b>, that shows the<br>
 spiritual quality involved. Some of the phrases employed by Jesus<br>
 here occur in the Psalms, some even in the Talmud <b><i>(itself later<br>
 than the New Testament, though of separate origin)</i></b>. That is of<br>
 small moment. "The originality of Jesus lies in putting the due<br>
 value on these thoughts, collecting them, and making them as<br>
 prominent as the Ten Commandments. No greater service can be<br>
 rendered to mankind than to rescue from obscurity neglected moral<br>
 commonplaces " <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Jesus repeated his sayings many times as<br>
 all great teachers and preachers do, but this sermon has unity,<br>
 progress, and consummation. It does not contain all that Jesus<br>
 taught by any means, but it stands out as the greatest single<br>
 sermon of all time, in its penetration, pungency, and power. <B>{The<br>
 poor in spirit}</B> <b><i>(\hoi pt&#333;choi t&#333;i pneumati\)</i></b>. Luke has only "the<br>
 poor," but he means the same by it as this form in Matthew, "the<br>
 pious in Israel, for the most part poor, whom the worldly rich<br>
 despised and persecuted" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. The word used here<br>
 <b><i>(\pt&#333;choi\)</i></b> is applied to the beggar Lazarus in <!-#-->Lu 16:20,22 and<br>
 suggests spiritual destitution <b><i>(from \pt&#333;ss&#333;\ to crouch, to<br>
 cower)</i></b>. The other word \pen&#275;s\ is from \penomai\, to work for<br>
 one's daily bread and so means one who works for his living. The<br>
 word \pt&#333;chos\ is more frequent in the New Testament and implies<br>
 deeper poverty than \pen&#275;s\. "The kingdom of heaven" here means<br>
 the reign of God in the heart and life. This is the _summum<br>
 bonum_ and is what matters most.<br>
 <br>
 5:4 <B>{They that mourn}</B> <b><i>(\hoi penthountes\)</i></b>. This is another<br>
 paradox. This verb "is most frequent in the LXX for mourning for<br>
 the dead, and for the sorrows and sins of others" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 "There can be no comfort where there is no grief" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Sorrow<br>
 should make us look for the heart and hand of God and so find the<br>
 comfort latent in the grief.<br>
 <br>
 5:5 <B>{The meek}</B> <b><i>(\hoi praeis\)</i></b>. Wycliff has it "Blessed be mild<br>
 men." The ancients used the word for outward conduct and towards<br>
 men. They did not rank it as a virtue anyhow. It was a mild<br>
 equanimity that was sometimes negative and sometimes positively<br>
 kind. But Jesus lifted the word to a nobility never attained<br>
 before. In fact, the Beatitudes assume a new heart, for the<br>
 natural man does not find in happiness the qualities mentioned<br>
 here by Christ. The English word "meek" has largely lost the fine<br>
 blend of spiritual poise and strength meant by the Master. He<br>
 calls himself "meek and lowly in heart" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 11:29)</i></b> and Moses is<br>
 also called meek. It is the gentleness of strength, not mere<br>
 effeminacy. By "the earth" <b><i>(\t&#275;n g&#275;n\)</i></b> Jesus seems to mean the<br>
 Land of Promise <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps 37:11)</i></b> though Bruce thinks that it is the<br>
 whole earth. Can it be the solid earth as opposed to the sea or<br>
 the air?<br>
 <br>
 5:6 <B>{They that hunger and thirst after righteousness}</B> <b><i>(\hoi<br>
 pein&#333;ntes kai dips&#333;ntes t&#275;n dikaiosun&#275;n\)</i></b>. Here Jesus turns one<br>
 of the elemental human instincts to spiritual use. There is in<br>
 all men hunger for food, for love, for God. It is passionate<br>
 hunger and thirst for goodness, for holiness. The word for<br>
 "filled" <b><i>(\chortasth&#275;sontai\)</i></b> means to feed or to fatten cattle<br>
 from the word for fodder or grass like <!-#-->Mr 6:39 "green grass"<br>
 <b><i>(\chortos chl&#333;ros\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:7 <B>{Obtain mercy}</B> <b><i>(\ele&#275;th&#275;sontai\)</i></b> "Sal win pitie theirsels"<br>
 <b><i>(_Braid Scots_)</i></b>. "A self-acting law of the moral world" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:8 <B>{Shall see God}</B> <b><i>(\ton theon opsontai\)</i></b>. Without holiness no<br>
 man will see the Lord in heaven <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 12:14)</i></b>. The Beatific<br>
 Vision is only possible here on earth to those with pure hearts.<br>
 No other can see the King now. Sin befogs and beclouds the heart<br>
 so that one cannot see God. Purity has here its widest sense and<br>
 includes everything.<br>
 <br>
 5:9 <B>{The peacemakers}</B> <b><i>(\hoi eir&#275;nopoioi\)</i></b>. Not merely "peaceable<br>
 men" <b><i>(Wycliff)</i></b> but "makkers up o' strife" <b><i>(_Braid Scots_)</i></b>. It is<br>
 hard enough to keep the peace. It is still more difficult to<br>
 bring peace where it is not. "The perfect peacemaker is the Son<br>
 of God <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph 2:14f.)</i></b>" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. Thus we shall be like our Elder<br>
 Brother.<br>
 <br>
 5:10 <B>{That have been persecuted for righteousness' sake}</B> <b><i>(\hoi<br>
 dedi&#333;gmenoi heneken dikaiosun&#275;s\)</i></b>. Posing as persecuted is a<br>
 favourite stunt. The kingdom of heaven belongs only to those who<br>
 suffer for the sake of goodness, not who are guilty of wrong.<br>
 <br>
 5:11 <B>{Falsely, for my sake}</B> <b><i>(\pseudomenoi heneken emou\)</i></b>. Codex<br>
 Bezae changes the order of these last Beatitudes, but that is<br>
 immaterial. What does matter is that the bad things said of<br>
 Christ's followers shall be untrue and that they are slandered<br>
 for Christ's sake. Both things must be true before one can wear a<br>
 martyr's crown and receive the great reward <b><i>(\misthos\)</i></b> in<br>
 heaven. No prize awaits one there who deserves all the evil said<br>
 of him and done to him here.<br>
 <br>
 5:13 <B>{Lost its savour}</B> <b><i>(\m&#333;ranth&#275;i\)</i></b>. The verb is from \m&#333;ros\<br>
 <b><i>(dull, sluggish, stupid, foolish)</i></b> and means to play the fool, to<br>
 become foolish, of salt become tasteless, insipid <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 9:50)</i></b>. It<br>
 is common in Syria and Palestine to see salt scattered in piles<br>
 on the ground because it has lost its flavour, "hae tint its<br>
 tang" <b><i>(_Braid Scots_)</i></b>, the most worthless thing imaginable. Jesus<br>
 may have used here a current proverb.<br>
 <br>
 5:15 <B>{Under the bushel}</B> <b><i>(\hupo ton modion\)</i></b>. Not a bushel. "The<br>
 figure is taken from lowly cottage life. There was a projecting<br>
 stone in the wall on which the lamp was set. The house consisted<br>
 of a single room, so that the tiny light sufficed for all"<br>
 <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. It was not put under the bushel <b><i>(the only one in the<br>
 room)</i></b> save to put it out or to hide it. The bushel was an<br>
 earthenware grain measure. "<B>{The stand}</B>" <b><i>(\t&#275;n luchnian\)</i></b>, not<br>
 "candlestick." It is "lamp-stand" in each of the twelve examples<br>
 in the Bible. There was the one lamp-stand for the single room.<br>
 <br>
 5:16 <B>{Even so}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s\)</i></b>. The adverb points backward to the<br>
 lamp-stand. Thus men are to let their light shine, not to glorify<br>
 themselves, but "your Father in heaven." Light shines to see<br>
 others by, not to call attention to itself.<br>
 <br>
 5:17 <B>{I came not to destroy, but to fulfil}</B> <b><i>(\ouk &#275;lthon<br>
 katalusai alla pl&#275;r&#333;sai\)</i></b>. The verb "destroy" means to "loosen<br>
 down" as of a house or tent <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 5:1)</i></b>. Fulfil is to fill full.<br>
 This Jesus did to the ceremonial law which pointed to him and the<br>
 moral law he kept. "He came to fill the law, to reveal the full<br>
 depth of meaning that it was intended to hold" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:18 <B>{One jot or one tittle}</B> <b><i>(\i&#333;ta hen &#275; mia kerea\)</i></b>. "Not an<br>
 iota, not a comma" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>, "not the smallest letter, not a<br>
 particle" <b><i>(Weymouth)</i></b>. The iota is the smallest Greek vowel, which<br>
 Matthew here uses to represent the Hebrew _yod_ <b><i>(jot)</i></b>, the<br>
 smallest Hebrew letter. "Tittle" is from the Latin _titulus_<br>
 which came to mean the stroke above an abbreviated word, then any<br>
 small mark. It is not certain here whether \kerea\ means a little<br>
 horn, the mere point which distinguishes some Hebrew letters from<br>
 others or the "hook" letter _Vav_. Sometimes _yod_ and _vav_ were<br>
 hardly distinguishable. "In _Vay_. R. 19 the guilt of altering<br>
 one of them is pronounced so great that if it were done the world<br>
 would be destroyed" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:19 <B>{Shall do and teach}</B> <b><i>(\poi&#275;s&#275;i kai didax&#275;i\)</i></b>. Jesus puts<br>
 practice before preaching. The teacher must apply the doctrine to<br>
 himself before he is qualified to teach others. The scribes and<br>
 Pharisees were men who "say and do not" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 23:3)</i></b>, who preach<br>
 but do not perform. This is Christ's test of greatness.<br>
 <br>
 5:20 <B>{Shall exceed}</B> <b><i>(\perisseus&#275;i pleion\)</i></b>. Overflow like a river<br>
 out of its banks and then Jesus adds "more" followed by an<br>
 unexpressed ablative <b><i>(\t&#275;s dikaiosun&#275;s\)</i></b>, brachylogy. A daring<br>
 statement on Christ's part that they had to be better than the<br>
 rabbis. They must excel the scribes, the small number of regular<br>
 teachers <b><i>(<!-#-->5:21-48)</i></b>, and the Pharisees in the Pharisaic life<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->6:1-18)</i></b> who were the separated ones, the orthodox pietists.<br>
 <br>
 5:22 <B>{But I say unto you}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; de leg&#333; humin\)</i></b>. Jesus thus<br>
 assumes a tone of superiority over the Mosaic regulations and<br>
 proves it in each of the six examples. He goes further than the<br>
 Law into the very heart. "<B>{Raca}</B>" <b><i>(\Raka\)</i></b> and "<B>{Thou fool}</B>"<br>
 <b><i>(\M&#333;re\)</i></b>. The first is probably an Aramaic word meaning "Empty,"<br>
 a frequent word for contempt. The second word is Greek <b><i>(dull,<br>
 stupid)</i></b> and is a fair equivalent of "raca." It is urged by some<br>
 that \m&#333;re\ is a Hebrew word, but Field <b><i>(_Otium Norvicense_)</i></b><br>
 objects to that idea. "_Raca_ expresses contempt for a man's<br>
 head=you stupid! _M&#333;re_ expresses contempt for his heart and<br>
 character=you scoundrel" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.  "<B>{The hell of fire}</B>" <b><i>(\t&#275;n<br>
 geennan tou puros\)</i></b>, "the Gehenna of fire," the genitive case<br>
 <b><i>(\tou puros\)</i></b> as the genus case describing Gehenna as marked by<br>
 fire. Gehenna is the Valley of Hinnom where the fire burned<br>
 continually. Here idolatrous Jews once offered their children to<br>
 Molech <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ki 23:10)</i></b>. Jesus finds one cause of murder to be<br>
 abusive language. Gehenna "should be carefully distinguished from<br>
 Hades <b><i>(\h&#257;id&#275;s\)</i></b> which is never used for the place of punishment,<br>
 but for the _place of departed spirits_, without reference to<br>
 their moral condition" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. The place of torment is in<br>
 Hades <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 16:23)</i></b>, but so is heaven.<br>
 <br>
 5:24 <B>{First be reconciled}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;ton diallag&#275;thi\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 passive imperative. Get reconciled <b><i>(ingressive aorist, take the<br>
 initiative)</i></b>. Only example of this compound in the New Testament<br>
 where usually \katallass&#333;\ occurs. Deissmann <b><i>(_Light from the<br>
 Ancient East_, p. 187, New Ed.)</i></b> gives a papyrus example second<br>
 century A.D. A prodigal son, Longinus, writes to his mother<br>
 Nilus: "I beseech thee, mother, be reconciled <b><i>(\dialag&#275;ti\)</i></b> with<br>
 me." The boy is a poor speller, but with a broken heart he uses<br>
 the identical form that Jesus does. "The verb denotes mutual<br>
 concession after mutual hostility, an idea absent from<br>
 \katallass&#333;\" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. This because of \dia\ <b><i>(two, between<br>
 two)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:25 <B>{Agree with}</B> <b><i>(\isthi euno&#333;n\)</i></b>. A present periphrastic active<br>
 imperative. The verb is from \eunoos\ <b><i>(friendly, kindly<br>
 disposed)</i></b>. "Mak up wi' yere enemy" <b><i>(_Braid Scots_)</i></b>. Compromise is<br>
 better than prison where no principle is involved, but only<br>
 personal interest. It is so easy to see principle where pride is<br>
 involved. <B>{The officer}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i hup&#275;ret&#275;i\)</i></b>. This word means "under<br>
 rower" on the ship with several ranks of rowers, the bottom rower<br>
 <b><i>(\hupo\ under and \&#275;ress&#333;\, to row)</i></b>, the galley-slave, then any<br>
 servant, the attendant in the synagogue <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 4:20)</i></b>. Luke so<br>
 describes John Mark in his relation to Barnabas and Saul <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 13:5)</i></b>. Then it is applied to the "ministers of the word" <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 1:2)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:26 <B>{The last farthing}</B> <b><i>(\ton eschaton kodrant&#275;n\)</i></b>. A Latin<br>
 word, _quadrans, 1/4 of an _as_ <b><i>(\assarion\)</i></b> or two mites <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 12:42)</i></b>, a vivid picture of inevitable punishment for debt. This<br>
 is emphasized by the strong double negative \ou m&#275;\ with the<br>
 aorist subjunctive.<br>
 <br>
 5:27 <B>{Thou shalt not commit adultery}</B> <b><i>(\ou moicheuseis\)</i></b>. These<br>
 quotations <b><i>(verses <!-#-->21,27,33)</i></b> from the Decalogue <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 20 and<br>
 <!-#-->De 5)</i></b> are from the Septuagint and use \ou\ and the future<br>
 indicative <b><i>(volitive future, common Greek idiom)</i></b>. In <!-#-->5:43 the<br>
 positive form, volitive future, occurs <b><i>(\agap&#275;seis\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->5:41<br>
 the third person <b><i>(\dot&#333;\)</i></b> singular second aorist active<br>
 imperative is used. In <!-#-->5:38 no verb occurs.<br>
 <br>
 5:28 <B>{In his heart}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i kardi&#257;i autou\)</i></b>. Not just the centre<br>
 of the blood circulation though it means that. Not just the<br>
 emotional part of man's nature, but here the inner man including<br>
 the intellect, the affections, the will. This word is exceedingly<br>
 common in the New Testament and repays careful study always. It<br>
 is from a root that means to quiver or palpitate. Jesus locates<br>
 adultery in the eye and heart before the outward act. Wunsche<br>
 <b><i>(_Beitrage_)</i></b> quotes two pertinent rabbinical sayings as<br>
 translated by Bruce: "The eye and the heart are the two brokers<br>
 of sin." "Passions lodge only in him who sees." Hence the peril<br>
 of lewd pictures and plays to the pure.<br>
 <br>
 5:29 <B>{Causeth thee to stumble}</B> <b><i>(\skandalizei se\)</i></b>. This is far<br>
 better than the Authorized Version "_Offend thee_."  _Braid<br>
 Scots_ has it rightly "ensnare ye." It is not the notion of<br>
 giving offence or provoking, but of setting a trap or snare for<br>
 one. The substantive <b><i>(\skandalon\, from \skandal&#275;thron\)</i></b> means<br>
 the stick in the trap that springs and closes the trap when the<br>
 animal touches it. Pluck out the eye when it is a snare, cut off<br>
 the hand, even the right hand. These vivid pictures are not to be<br>
 taken literally, but powerfully plead for self-mastery. Bengel<br>
 says: _Non oculum, sed scandalizentem oculum_. It is not<br>
 mutilating of the body that Christ enjoins, but control of the<br>
 body against sin. The man who plays with fire will get burnt.<br>
 Modern surgery finely illustrates the teaching of Jesus. The<br>
 tonsils, the teeth, the appendix, to go no further, if left<br>
 diseased, will destroy the whole body. Cut them out in time and<br>
 the life will be saved. Vincent notes that "the words scandal and<br>
 slander are both derived from \skandalon\. And Wyc. renders, 'if<br>
 thy right eye _slander_ thee.'" Certainly slander is a scandal<br>
 and a stumbling-block, a trap, and a snare.<br>
 <br>
 5:31 <B>{A writing of divorcement}</B> <b><i>(\apostasion\)</i></b>, "a divorce<br>
 certificate" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>, "a written notice of divorce" <b><i>(Weymouth)</i></b>.<br>
 The Greek is an abbreviation of \biblion apostasiou\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ma 19:7;<br>
 Mr 10:4)</i></b>. Vulgate has here _libellum repudii_. The papyri use<br>
 \suggraph&#275; apostasiou\ in commercial transactions as "a bond of<br>
 release" <b><i>(see Moulton and Milligan's _Vocabulary_, etc.)</i></b> The<br>
 written notice <b><i>(\biblion\)</i></b> was a protection to the wife against<br>
 an angry whim of the husband who might send her away with no<br>
 paper to show for it.<br>
 <br>
 5:32 <B>{Saving for the cause of fornication}</B> <b><i>(\parektos logou<br>
 porneias\)</i></b>. An unusual phrase that perhaps means "except for a<br>
 matter of unchastity." "Except on the ground of unchastity"<br>
 <b><i>(Weymouth)</i></b>, "except unfaithfulness" <b><i>(Goodspeed)</i></b>, and is<br>
 equivalent to \m&#275; epi pornei&#257;i\ in <!-#-->Mt 19:9. McNeile denies that<br>
 Jesus made this exception because Mark and Luke do not give it.<br>
 He claims that the early Christians made the exception to meet a<br>
 pressing need, but one fails to see the force of this charge<br>
 against Matthew's report of the words of Jesus. It looks like<br>
 criticism to meet modern needs.<br>
 <br>
 5:34 <B>{Swear not at all}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; omosai hol&#333;s\)</i></b>. More exactly "not to<br>
 swear at all" <b><i>(indirect command, and aorist infinitive)</i></b>.<br>
 Certainly Jesus does not prohibit oaths in a court of justice for<br>
 he himself answered Caiaphas on oath. Paul made solemn appeals to<br>
 God <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 5:27; 1Co 15:31)</i></b>. Jesus prohibits all forms of<br>
 profanity. The Jews were past-masters in the art of splitting<br>
 hairs about allowable and forbidden oaths or forms of profanity<br>
 just as modern Christians employ a great variety of vernacular<br>
 "cuss-words" and excuse themselves because they do not use the<br>
 more flagrant forms.<br>
 <br>
 5:38 <B>{An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth}</B> <b><i>(\ophthalmon<br>
 anti ophthalmou kai odonta anti odontos\)</i></b>. Note \anti\ with the<br>
 notion of exchange or substitution. The quotation is from <!-#-->Ex<br>
 21:24; De 19:21; Le 24:20. Like divorce this _jus talionis_ is a<br>
 restriction upon unrestrained vengeance. "It limited revenge by<br>
 fixing an exact compensation for an injury" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. A money<br>
 payment is allowed in the Mishna. The law of retaliation exists<br>
 in Arabia today.<br>
 <br>
 5:39 <B>{Resist not him that is evil}</B> <b><i>(\me antist&#275;nai t&#333;i pon&#275;r&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Here again it is the infinitive <b><i>(second aorist active)</i></b> in<br>
 indirect command. But is it "the evil man" or the "evil deed"?<br>
 The dative case is the same form for masculine and neuter.<br>
 Weymouth puts it "not to resist a <b><i>(the)</i></b> wicked man," Moffatt "not<br>
 to resist an injury," Goodspeed "not to resist injury." The<br>
 examples will go with either view. Jesus protested when smitten<br>
 on the cheek <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:22)</i></b>. And Jesus denounced the Pharisees<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 23)</i></b> and fought the devil always. The language of Jesus is<br>
 bold and picturesque and is not to be pressed too literally.<br>
 Paradoxes startle and make us think. We are expected to fill in<br>
 the other side of the picture. One thing certainly is meant by<br>
 Jesus and that is that personal revenge is taken out of our<br>
 hands, and that applies to "lynch-law." Aggressive or offensive<br>
 war by nations is also condemned, but not necessarily defensive<br>
 war or defence against robbery and murder. Professional pacifism<br>
 may be mere cowardice.<br>
 <br>
 5:40 <B>{Thy coat ... thy cloke also}</B> <b><i>(\ton chit&#333;na sou kai to<br>
 himation\)</i></b>. The "coat" is really a sort of shirt or undergarment<br>
 and would be demanded at law. A robber would seize first the<br>
 outer garment or cloke <b><i>(one coat)</i></b>. If one loses the undergarment<br>
 at law, the outer one goes also <b><i>(the more valuable one)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:41 <B>{Shall compel thee}</B> <b><i>(\aggareusei\)</i></b>. The Vulgate has<br>
 _angariaverit_. The word is of Persian origin and means public<br>
 couriers or mounted messengers <b><i>(\aggaroi\)</i></b> who were stationed by<br>
 the King of Persia at fixed localities, with horses ready for<br>
 use, to send royal messages from one to another. So if a man is<br>
 passing such a post-station, an official may rush out and compel<br>
 him to go back to another station to do an errand for the king.<br>
 This was called impressment into service. This very thing was<br>
 done to Simon of Cyrene who was thus compelled to carry the cross<br>
 of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:32, \&#275;ggareusan\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:42 <B>{Turn not thou away}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; apostraph&#275;is\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 passive subjunctive in prohibition. "This is one of the clearest<br>
 instances of the necessity of accepting the spirit and not the<br>
 letter of the Lord's commands <b><i>(see vv.<!-#-->32,34,38)</i></b>. Not only does<br>
 indiscriminate almsgiving do little but injury to society, but<br>
 the words must embrace far more than almsgiving" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 Recall again that Jesus is a popular teacher and expects men to<br>
 understand his paradoxes. In the organized charities of modern<br>
 life we are in danger of letting the milk of human kindness dry<br>
 up.<br>
 <br>
 5:43 <B>{And hate thine enemy}</B> <b><i>(\kai mis&#275;seis\)</i></b>. This phrase is not<br>
 in <!-#-->Le 19:18, but is a rabbinical inference which Jesus<br>
 repudiates bluntly. The Talmud says nothing of love to enemies.<br>
 Paul in <!-#-->Ro 12:20 quotes <!-#-->Pr 25:22 to prove that we ought to<br>
 treat our enemies kindly. Jesus taught us to pray for our enemies<br>
 and did it himself even when he hung upon the cross. Our word<br>
 "neighbour" is "nigh-bor," one who is nigh or near like the Greek<br>
 word \pl&#275;sion\ here. But proximity often means strife and not<br>
 love. Those who have adjoining farms or homes may be positively<br>
 hostile in spirit. The Jews came to look on members of the same<br>
 tribe as neighbours as even Jews everywhere. But they hated the<br>
 Samaritans who were half Jews and lived between Judea and<br>
 Galilee. Jesus taught men how to act as neighbours by the parable<br>
 of the Good Samaritan <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 10:29ff.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:48 <B>{Perfect}</B> <b><i>(\teleioi\)</i></b>. The word comes from \telos\, end,<br>
 goal, limit. Here it is the goal set before us, the absolute<br>
 standard of our Heavenly Father. The word is used also for<br>
 relative perfection as of adults compared with children.<br>
