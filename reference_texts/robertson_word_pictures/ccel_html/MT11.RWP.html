<p>11:1 <B>{He departed thence to teach and preach}</B> <b><i>(\meteb&#275; ekeithen<br>
 tou didaskein kai k&#275;russein\)</i></b>. In five instances <b><i>(<!-#-->7:28; 11:1;<br>
 13:53; 19:1; 26:1)</i></b> after great discourses by Jesus "the<br>
 transition to what follows is made with the formula, 'And it came<br>
 to pass when Jesus had ended'" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. This is a wrong chapter<br>
 division, for <!-#-->11:1 belongs with the preceding section.<br>
 "<B>{Commanding}</B>" <b><i>(\diatass&#333;n\, complementary participle with<br>
 \etelesen\)</i></b>, means giving orders in detail <b><i>(\dia-\)</i></b> for each of<br>
 them. Note both "teach and preach" as in <!-#-->4:23. Where did Jesus<br>
 go? Did he follow behind the twelve as he did with the seventy<br>
 "whither he himself was about to come" <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 10:1)</i></b>? Bruce holds<br>
 with Chrysostom that Jesus avoided the places where they were,<br>
 giving them room and time to do their work. But, if Jesus himself<br>
 went to the chief cities of Galilee on this tour, he would be<br>
 compelled to touch many of the same points. Jesus would naturally<br>
 follow behind at some distance. At the end of the tour the<br>
 apostles come together in Capernaum and tell Jesus all that they<br>
 had done and that they had taught <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 6:30)</i></b>. Matthew follows<br>
 the general outline of Mark, but the events are not grouped in<br>
 chronological order here.<br>
 <br>
 11:2 <B>{John heard in the prison}</B> <b><i>(\ho de I&#333;an&#275;s akousas en t&#333;i<br>
 desm&#333;t&#275;ri&#333;i\)</i></b>. Probably <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 7:18)</i></b> the raising of the son of the<br>
 widow of Nain. The word for prison here is the place where one<br>
 was kept bound <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 5:21,23; 16:26)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mt 4:12. It was in<br>
 Machaerus east of the Dead Sea which at this time belonged to the<br>
 rule of Herod Antipas <b><i>(Jos. _Ant_. XVIII. v.2)</i></b>. John's disciples<br>
 had access to him. So he sent word by <b><i>(\dia\, not \duo\ as in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 7:19)</i></b> them to Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 11:3 <B>{He that cometh}</B> <b><i>(\ho erchomenos\)</i></b>. This phrase refers to<br>
 the Messiah <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 11:9; Lu 13:35; 19:38; Heb 10:37; Ps 118:26; Da<br>
 7:13)</i></b>. Some rabbis applied the phrase to some forerunner of the<br>
 kingdom <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. Was there to be "another" <b><i>(\heteron\)</i></b> after<br>
 Jesus? John had been in prison "long enough to develop a _prison<br>
 mood_" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. It was once clear enough to him, but his<br>
 environment was depressing and Jesus had done nothing to get him<br>
 out of Machaerus <b><i>(see chapter IX in my _John the Loyal_)</i></b>. John<br>
 longed for reassurance.<br>
 <br>
 11:4 <B>{The things which ye do hear and see}</B> <b><i>(\ha akouete kai<br>
 blepete\)</i></b>. This symbolical message was for John to interpret, not<br>
 for them.<br>
 <br>
 11:5 <B>{And the dead are raised up}</B> <b><i>(\kai nekroi egeirontai\)</i></b>. Like<br>
 that of the son of the widow of Nain. Did he raise the dead also<br>
 on this occasion? "Tell John your story over again and remind him<br>
 of these prophetic texts, <!-#-->Isa 35:5; 61:1" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. The items<br>
 were convincing enough and clearer than mere eschatological<br>
 symbolism. "The poor" in particular have the gospel, a climax.<br>
 <br>
 11:6 <B>{Whosoever shall find none occasion of stumbling in me}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hos an m&#275; skandalisth&#275;i en emoi\)</i></b>. Indefinite relative clause<br>
 with first aorist passive subjunctive. This beatitude is a rebuke<br>
 to John for his doubt even though in prison. Doubt is not a proof<br>
 of superior intellect, scholarship, or piety. John was in the fog<br>
 and that is the time not to make serious decisions. "In some way<br>
 even the Baptist had found some occasion of stumbling in Jesus"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:7 <B>{As these went their way}</B> <b><i>(\tout&#333;n poreuomen&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 participle genitive absolute. The eulogy of Jesus was spoken as<br>
 the two disciples of John were going away. Is it a matter of<br>
 regret that they did not hear this wondrous praise of John that<br>
 they might cheer him with it? "It may almost be called the<br>
 funeral oration of the Baptist, for not long afterwards Herodias<br>
 compassed his death" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{A reed shaken by the wind}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kalamon hupo anemou saleuomenon\)</i></b>. Latin _calamus_. Used of the<br>
 reeds that grew in plenty in the Jordan Valley where John<br>
 preached, of a staff made of a reed <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:29)</i></b>, as a measuring<br>
 rod <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 11:1)</i></b>, of a writer's pen <b><i>(<!-#-->3Jo 1:13)</i></b>. The reeds by the<br>
 Jordan bent with the wind, but not so John.<br>
 <br>
 11:9 <B>{And much more than a prophet}</B> <b><i>(\kai perissoteron<br>
 proph&#275;tou\)</i></b>. Ablative of comparison after \perissoteron\ itself<br>
 comparative though meaning exceeding <b><i>(surrounded by,<br>
 overflowing)</i></b>. John had all the great qualities of the true<br>
 prophet: "Vigorous moral conviction, integrity, strength of will,<br>
 fearless zeal for truth and righteousness" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. And then he<br>
 was the Forerunner of the Messiah <b><i>(<!-#-->Mal 3:1)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:11 <B>{He that is but little}</B> <b><i>(\ho mikroteros\)</i></b>. The Authorized<br>
 Version here has it better, "he that is least." The article with<br>
 the comparative is a growing idiom in the vernacular _Koin&#275;_ for<br>
 the superlative as in the modern Greek it is the only idiom for<br>
 the superlative <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar of the Greek N.T._, p. 668)</i></b>.<br>
 The papyri and inscriptions show the same construction. The<br>
 paradox of Jesus has puzzled many. He surely means that John is<br>
 greater <b><i>(\meiz&#333;n\)</i></b> than all others in character, but that the<br>
 least in the kingdom of heaven surpasses him in privilege. John<br>
 is the end of one age, "until John" <b><i>(<!-#-->11:14)</i></b>, and the beginning<br>
 of the new era. All those that come after John stand upon his<br>
 shoulders. John is the mountain peak between the old and the new.<br>
 <br>
 11:12 <B>{Suffereth violence}</B> <b><i>(\biazetai\)</i></b>. This verb occurs only<br>
 here and in <!-#-->Lu 16:16 in the N.T. It seems to be middle in Luke<br>
 and Deissmann <b><i>(_Bible Studies_, p. 258)</i></b> quotes an inscription<br>
 "where \biazomai\ is without doubt reflexive and absolute" as in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 16:16. But there are numerous papyri examples where it is<br>
 passive <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan, _Vocabulary_, etc.)</i></b> so that "there<br>
 seems little that promises decisive help for the difficult Logion<br>
 of <!-#-->Mt 11:12; Lu 16:16." So then in <!-#-->Mt 11:12 the form can be<br>
 either middle or passive and either makes sense, though a<br>
 different sense. The passive idea is that the kingdom is forced,<br>
 is stormed, is taken by men of violence like "men of violence<br>
 take it by force" <b><i>(\biastai harpazousin aut&#275;n\)</i></b> or seize it like<br>
 a conquered city. The middle voice may mean "experiences<br>
 violence" or "forces its way" like a rushing mighty wind <b><i>(so Zahn<br>
 holds)</i></b>. These difficult words of Jesus mean that the preaching of<br>
 John "had led to a violent and impetuous thronging to gather<br>
 round Jesus and his disciples" <b><i>(Hort, _Judaistic Christianity_,<br>
 p. 26)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:14 <B>{This is Elijah}</B> <b><i>(\autos estin Eleias\)</i></b>. Jesus here<br>
 endorses John as the promise of Malachi. The people understood<br>
 <!-#-->Mal 4:1 to mean the return of Elijah in person. This John<br>
 denied as to himself <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:21)</i></b>. But Jesus affirms that John is<br>
 the Elijah of promise who has come already <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 17:12)</i></b>. He<br>
 emphasizes the point: "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."<br>
 <br>
 11:17 <B>{Children sitting in the market places}</B> <b><i>(\paidiois<br>
 kath&#275;menois en tais agorais\)</i></b>. This parable of the children<br>
 playing in the market place is given also in <!-#-->Lu 7:31f. Had<br>
 Jesus as a child in Nazareth not played games with the children?<br>
 He had certainly watched them often since. The interest of Christ<br>
 in children was keen. He has really created the modern child's<br>
 world out of the indifference of the past. They would not play<br>
 wedding or funeral in a peevish fret. These metaphors in the<br>
 Gospels are vivid to those with eyes to see. The \agora\ was<br>
 originally the assembly, then the forum or public square where<br>
 the people gathered for trade or for talk as in Athens <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 17:17)</i></b> and in many modern towns. So the Roman Forum. The<br>
 oriental bazaars today are held in streets rather than public<br>
 squares. Even today with all the automobiles children play in the<br>
 streets. In English the word "cheap" <b><i>(Cheapside)</i></b> meant only<br>
 barter and price, not cheap in our sense. The word for mourn<br>
 <b><i>(\ekopsasthe\)</i></b> means to beat the heart, direct middle, after the<br>
 fashion of eastern funeral lamentations.<br>
 <br>
 11:19 <B>{Wisdom is justified by her works}</B> <b><i>(\edikai&#333;th&#275; apo t&#333;n<br>
 erg&#333;n aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. A timeless aorist passive <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_,<br>
 p. 836f.)</i></b>. The word "justified" means "set right" Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 7:35)</i></b> has "by all her children" as some MSS. have here to make<br>
 Matthew like Luke. These words are difficult, but understandable.<br>
 God's wisdom has planned the different conduct of both John and<br>
 Jesus. He does not wish all to be just alike in everything. "This<br>
 generation" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->16)</i></b> is childish, not childlike, and full of<br>
 whimsical inconsistencies in their faultfinding. They exaggerate<br>
 in each case. John did not have a demon and Jesus was not a<br>
 glutton or a winebibber. "And, worse than either, for \philos\ is<br>
 used in a sinister sense and implies that Jesus was the comrade<br>
 of the worst characters, and like them in conduct. A malicious<br>
 nickname at first, it is now a name of honour: the sinner's<br>
 lover" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Lu 15:2. The plan of God is justified by<br>
 results.<br>
 <br>
 11:20 <B>{Most of his mighty works}</B> <b><i>(\hai pleistai dunameis autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "His very many mighty works" if elative as usual in<br>
 the papyri <b><i>(Moulton, _Prolegomena_, p. 79; Robertson, _Grammar_,<br>
 p. 670)</i></b>. But the usual superlative makes sense here as the<br>
 Canterbury translation has it. This word \dunamis\ for miracle<br>
 presents the notion of _power_ like our _dynamite_. The word<br>
 \teras\ is wonder, portent, _miraculum_ <b><i>(miracle)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 2:19. It occurs only in the plural and always with \s&#275;meia\. The<br>
 word \s&#275;meion\ means sign <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 12:38)</i></b> and is very common in<br>
 John's Gospel as well as the word \ergon\ <b><i>(work)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Joh<br>
 5:36. Other words used are \paradoxon\, our word _paradox_,<br>
 strange <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 5:26)</i></b>, \endoxon\, glorious <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 13:17)</i></b>,<br>
 \thaumasion\, wonderful <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 21:15)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:21 <B>{Chorazin}</B> <b><i>(\Chorazein\)</i></b>. Mentioned only here and in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 10:13. Proof of "the meagreness of our knowledge of Judaism in<br>
 the time of Christ" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b> and of the many things not told in<br>
 our Gospels <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 21:25)</i></b>. We know something of Bethsaida and<br>
 more about Capernaum as places of privilege. But <b><i>(\pl&#275;n\,<br>
 howbeit)</i></b> neither of these cities repented, changed their conduct.<br>
 Note condition of the second class, determined as unfulfilled in<br>
 verses <!-#-->21 and <!-#-->23.<br>
 <br>
 11:25 <B>{At that season Jesus answered and said}</B> <b><i>(\en ekein&#333;i t&#333;i<br>
 kair&#333;i apokritheis eipen\)</i></b>. Spoke to his Father in audible voice.<br>
 The time and place we do not know. But here we catch a glimpse of<br>
 Jesus in one of his moods of worship. "It is usual to call this<br>
 golden utterance a prayer, but it is at once prayer, praise, and<br>
 self-communing in a devout spirit" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Critics are disturbed<br>
 because this passage from the Logia of Jesus or Q of Synoptic<br>
 criticism <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 11:25-30; Lu 10:21-24)</i></b> is so manifestly Johannine<br>
 in spirit and very language, "the Father" <b><i>(\ho pat&#275;r\)</i></b>, "the son"<br>
 <b><i>(\ho huios\)</i></b>, whereas the Fourth Gospel was not written till the<br>
 close of the first century and the Logia was written before the<br>
 Synoptic Gospels. The only satisfying explanation lies in the<br>
 fact that Jesus did have this strain of teaching that is<br>
 preserved in John's Gospel. Here he is in precisely the same mood<br>
 of elevated communion with the Father that we have reflected in<br>
 John 14 to 17. Even Harnack is disposed to accept this Logion as<br>
 a genuine saying of Jesus. The word "thank" <b><i>(\homologoumai\)</i></b> is<br>
 better rendered "praise" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>. Jesus praises the Father "not<br>
 that the \sophoi\ were ignorant, but that the \n&#275;pioi\ knew"<br>
 <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:26 <B>{Wellpleasing in thy sight}</B> <b><i>(\eudokia emprosthen sou\)</i></b>.<br>
 "For such has been thy gracious will" <b><i>(Weymouth)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:27 <B>{All things have been delivered unto me of my Father}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\panta moi paredoth&#275; hupo tou patros mou\)</i></b>. This sublime claim<br>
 is not to be whittled down or away by explanations. It is the<br>
 timeless aorist like \edoth&#275;\ in <!-#-->28:18 and "points back to a<br>
 moment in eternity, and implies the pre-existence of the Messiah"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. The Messianic consciousness of Christ is here as clear<br>
 as a bell. It is a moment of high fellowship. Note \epigin&#333;skei\<br>
 twice for "fully know." Note also \boul&#275;tai\ =wills, is willing.<br>
 The Son retains the power and the will to reveal the Father to<br>
 men.<br>
 <br>
 11:28 <B>{Come unto me}</B> <b><i>(\deute pros me\)</i></b>. Verses 28 to 30 are not<br>
 in Luke and are among the special treasures of Matthew's Gospel.<br>
 No sublimer words exist than this call of Jesus to the toiling<br>
 and the burdened <b><i>(\pephortismenoi\, perfect passive participle,<br>
 state of weariness)</i></b> to come to him. He towers above all men as he<br>
 challenges us. "I will refresh you" <b><i>(\k'ago anapaus&#333; h&#8211;mas\)</i></b>. Far<br>
 more than mere rest, rejuvenation. The English slang expression<br>
 "rest up" is close to the idea of the Greek compound \ana-pau&#333;\.<br>
 It is causative active voice.<br>
 <br>
 11:29 <B>{Take my yoke upon you and learn of me}</B> <b><i>(\arate ton zugon<br>
 mou eph'humas kai mathete ap'emou\)</i></b>. The rabbis used yoke for<br>
 school as many pupils find it now a yoke. The English word<br>
 "school" is Greek for leisure <b><i>(\schol&#275;\)</i></b>. But Jesus offers<br>
 refreshment <b><i>(\anapausin\)</i></b> in his school and promises to make the<br>
 burden light, for he is a meek and humble teacher. Humility was<br>
 not a virtue among the ancients. It was ranked with servility.<br>
 Jesus has made a virtue of this vice. He has glorified this<br>
 attitude so that Paul urges it <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 2:3)</i></b>, "in lowliness of mind<br>
 each counting other better than himself." In portions of Europe<br>
 today people place yokes on the shoulders to make the burden<br>
 easier to carry. Jesus promises that we shall find the yoke<br>
 kindly and the burden lightened by his help. "Easy" is a poor<br>
 translation of \chr&#275;stos\. Moffatt puts it "kindly." That is the<br>
 meaning in the Septuagint for persons. We have no adjective that<br>
 quite carries the notion of kind and good. The yoke of Christ is<br>
 useful, good, and kindly. Cf. <!-#-->So 1:10.<br>
