<p>3:1 <B>{Had his hand withered}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#275;rammen&#275;n ech&#333;n t&#275;n cheira\)</i></b>. He<br>
 had his <b><i>(<B>{the}</B> in the Greek, common idiom with article as<br>
 possessive)</i></b> hand <b><i>(right hand, <!-#-->Lu 6:6)</i></b> in a withered state,<br>
 perfect passive participle <b><i>(adjective \x&#275;ran\ in Matthew and<br>
 Luke)</i></b>, showing that it was not congenital, but the result of<br>
 injury by accident or disease. Bengel: _Non ex utero, sed morbo<br>
 aut vulnere_.<br>
 <br>
 3:2 <B>{They watched}</B> <b><i>(\paret&#275;roun\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense, were watching<br>
 on the side <b><i>(or sly)</i></b>. Luke uses the middle voice, \paret&#275;rounto\,<br>
 to accent their personal interest in the proceedings. It was the<br>
 sabbath day and in the synagogue and they were there ready to<br>
 catch him in the act if he should dare to violate their rules as<br>
 he had done in the wheat fields on the previous sabbath. Probably<br>
 the same Pharisees are present now as then. <B>{That they might<br>
 accuse him}</B> <b><i>(\hina kat&#275;gor&#275;s&#333;sin autou\)</i></b>. So <!-#-->Mt 12:10. Luke has<br>
 it "that they might find how to accuse him" <b><i>(\hina heur&#333;sin<br>
 kat&#275;gorein autou\)</i></b>. They were determined to accuse him. The<br>
 sabbath controversy offered the best opening. So here they are<br>
 ready for business.<br>
 <br>
 3:3 <B>{Stand forth}</B> <b><i>(\egeire eis to meson\)</i></b>. Step into the middle<br>
 of the room where all can see. It was a bold defiance of the<br>
 Christ's spying enemies. Wycliff rightly puts it: <B>{They aspieden<br>
 him}</B>. They played the spy on Jesus. One can see the commotion<br>
 among the long-bearded hypocrites at this daring act of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 3:4 <B>{But they held their peace}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de esi&#333;p&#333;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 tense. In sullen silence and helplessness before the merciless<br>
 questions of Jesus as the poor man stood there before them all.<br>
 Jesus by his pitiless alternatives between doing good<br>
 <b><i>(\agathopoie&#333;\, late Greek word in LXX and N.T.)</i></b> and doing evil<br>
 <b><i>(\kakopoie&#333;\, ancient Greek word)</i></b>, to this man, for instance, <B>{to<br>
 save a life or to kill}</B> <b><i>(\psuch&#275;n s&#333;sai &#275; apokteinai\)</i></b>, as in<br>
 this case. It was a terrible exposure.<br>
 <br>
 3:5 <B>{When he had looked round on them with anger}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\periblepsamenos autous met' org&#275;s\)</i></b>. Mark has a good deal to<br>
 say about the looks of Jesus with this word <b><i>(<!-#-->3:5,34; 5:37; 9:8;<br>
 10:23; 11:11)</i></b> as here. So Luke only once, <!-#-->Lu 6:10. The eyes of<br>
 Jesus swept the room all round and each rabbinical hypocrite felt<br>
 the cut of that condemnatory glance. This indignant anger was not<br>
 inconsistent with the love and pity of Jesus. Murder was in their<br>
 hearts and Jesus knew it. Anger against wrong as wrong is a sign<br>
 of moral health <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>. <B>{Being grieved at the hardness of their<br>
 hearts}</B> <b><i>(\sunlupoumenos epi t&#275;i p&#333;r&#333;sei t&#275;s kardias aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Mark<br>
 alone gives this point. The anger was tempered by grief <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>.<br>
 Jesus is the Man of Sorrows and this present participle brings<br>
 out the continuous state of grief whereas the momentary angry<br>
 look is expressed by the aorist participle above. Their own heart<br>
 or attitude was in a state of moral ossification <b><i>(\p&#333;r&#333;sis\)</i></b> like<br>
 hardened hands or feet. \P&#333;ros\ was used of a kind of marble and<br>
 then of the _callus_ on fractured bones. "They were hardened by<br>
 previous conceptions against this new truth" <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>. See also on<br>
 &#175;Mt 12:9-14.<br>
 <br>
 3:6 <B>{And straightway with the Herodians took council}</B> <b><i>(\euthus<br>
 meta t&#333;n H&#275;r&#333;idian&#333;n\)</i></b>. The Pharisees could stand no more. So out<br>
 they stalked at once in a rage of madness <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:11)</i></b> and outside<br>
 of the synagogue took counsel <b><i>(\sumboulion epoi&#275;san\)</i></b> or gave<br>
 counsel <b><i>(\sumboulion edidoun\, as some MSS. have it, imperfect<br>
 tense, offered counsel as their solution of the problem)</i></b> with<br>
 their bitter enemies, the Herodians, on the sabbath day still<br>
 "how they might destroy him" <b><i>(\hop&#333;s auton apoles&#333;sin\)</i></b>, a<br>
 striking illustration of the alternatives of Jesus a few moments<br>
 before, "to save life or to kill." This is the first mention of<br>
 the Herodians or adherents of Herod Antipas and the Herod family<br>
 rather than the Romans. The Pharisees would welcome the help of<br>
 their rivals to destroy Jesus. In the presence of Jesus they<br>
 unite their forces as in <!-#-->Mr 8:15; 12:13; Mt 22:16.<br>
 <br>
 3:7 <B>{Withdrew to the sea}</B> <b><i>(\anech&#333;r&#275;sen eis t&#275;n thalassan\)</i></b>.<br>
 Evidently Jesus knew of the plot to kill him, "perceiving it"<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 12:15)</i></b>. "He and His would be safer by the open beach"<br>
 <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. He has the disciples with him. Vincent notes that on<br>
 eleven occasions Mark mentions the withdrawals of Jesus to escape<br>
 his enemies, for prayer, for rest, for private conference with<br>
 his disciples <b><i>(<!-#-->1:12; 3:7; 6:31,46; 7:24,31; 9:2; 10:1; 14:34)</i></b>.<br>
 But, as often, a great multitude <b><i>(\polu pl&#275;thos\)</i></b> from Galilee<br>
 followed him.<br>
 <br>
 3:8 <B>{Hearing what great things he did}</B> <b><i>(\akouontes hosa poiei\)</i></b>.<br>
 Masculine plural present participle, though \pl&#275;thos\ is neuter<br>
 singular <b><i>(construction according to sense in both number and<br>
 gender)</i></b>. This crowd by the sea came from Galilee, Judea,<br>
 Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond Jordan <b><i>(Decapolis and Perea)</i></b>, Tyre and<br>
 Sidon, Phoenicia, North, South, East, and Northwest, even from<br>
 Idumea <b><i>(mentioned here alone in the N.T.)</i></b> won by John Hyrcanus to<br>
 Palestine. "In our Lord's time Idumea was practically a part of<br>
 Judea with a Jewish circumcised population" <b><i>(George Adam Smith)</i></b>.<br>
 Many of these were probably Gentiles <b><i>(Phoenicia and Decapolis)</i></b><br>
 and may have known only the Greek language. The fame of Jesus had<br>
 spread through all the regions round about. There was a jam as<br>
 the crowds came to Jesus by the Sea of Galilee.<br>
 <br>
 3:9 <B>{That a little boat should wait on him}</B> <b><i>(\hina ploiarion<br>
 proskarter&#275;i aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. The boat was to keep close <b><i>(note present<br>
 tense subjunctive of \proskartere&#333;\)</i></b> to the shore in constant<br>
 readiness and move as Jesus did. Whether he needed it or not is<br>
 not told, but it was there at hand. <B>{Lest they should throng him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hina m&#275; thlib&#333;sin auton\)</i></b>. Press or crush him. Jesus stayed<br>
 with the crowds for they needed him. Present subjunctive again.<br>
 <br>
 3:10 <B>{Pressed upon him}</B> <b><i>(\epipiptein aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Were falling upon<br>
 him to such an extent that it was dangerous. They were not<br>
 hostile, but simply intensely eager, each to have his own case<br>
 attended to by Jesus. <B>{That they might touch him}</B> <b><i>(\hina autou<br>
 haps&#333;ntai\)</i></b>. If only that much. They hoped for a cure by contact<br>
 with Christ. Aorist subjunctive. It was a really pathetic scene<br>
 and a tremendous strain on Jesus. <B>{As many as had plagues}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hosoi eichon mastigas\)</i></b>. Strokes or scourges, terms used by us<br>
 today as a paralytic stroke, the influenza scourge. Our word<br>
 plague is from \pl&#275;g&#275;\ <b><i>(Latin _plaga_)</i></b>, from \pl&#275;gnumi\, to<br>
 strike a blow. Common in ancient Greek in this sense. See <!-#-->Mr<br>
 5:29,34; Lu 7:21 for the same use of \mastiges\ and also 2Macc.<br>
 9:11.<br>
 <br>
 3:11 <B>{Whensoever they beheld him}</B> <b><i>(\hotan auton ethe&#333;roun\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect indicative with \hotan\ of repeated action. They kept<br>
 falling down before him <b><i>(\prosepipton\)</i></b> and crying, <b><i>(\ekrazon\)</i></b><br>
 and he kept charging or rebuking <b><i>(\epitim&#257;\)</i></b> them, all<br>
 imperfects. The unclean spirits <b><i>(demons)</i></b> recognize Jesus as the<br>
 Son of God, as before. Jesus charged them not to make him known<br>
 as he had also done before. He did not wish this testimony. It<br>
 was a most exciting ordeal and is given only by Mark. Note<br>
 non-final use of \hina\.<br>
 <br>
 3:13 <B>{He goeth up into the mountain}</B> <b><i>(\anabainei eis to oros\)</i></b>.<br>
 So Matthew <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:1)</i></b> and Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:12)</i></b>, "to pray" Luke adds.<br>
 Historical present so common in Mark's vivid narrative. Neither<br>
 Gospel gives the name of the mountain, assuming it as well known,<br>
 probably not far from the lake. <B>{Whom he himself would}</B> <b><i>(\hous<br>
 &#275;thelen autos\)</i></b>. Emphatic use of \autos\ <b><i>(himself)</i></b> at end of<br>
 sentence. Whether by personal imitation or through the disciples<br>
 Jesus invites or calls to himself <b><i>(\proskaleitai\, historical<br>
 middle present indicative)</i></b> a select number out of the vast crowds<br>
 by the sea, those whom he really wished to be with him. <B>{They<br>
 went off to him}</B> <b><i>(\ap&#275;lthon pros auton\)</i></b>. Luke states that Jesus<br>
 "continued all night in prayer, to God." It was a crisis in the<br>
 ministry of Christ. This select group up in the hills probably<br>
 respected the long agony of Jesus though they did not comprehend<br>
 his motive. They formed a sort of spiritual body-guard around the<br>
 Master during his night vigil in the mountain.<br>
 <br>
 3:14 <B>{He appointed twelve}</B> <b><i>(\epoi&#275;sen d&#333;deka\)</i></b>. This was a second<br>
 selection out of those invited to the hills and after the night<br>
 of prayer and after day came <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:13)</i></b>. Why he chose twelve we<br>
 are not told, probably because there were twelve tribes in<br>
 Israel. It was a good round number at any rate. They were to be<br>
 princes in the new Israel <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mt 19:28; Lu 22:30; Re<br>
 21:14,15)</i></b>. Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:13-16)</i></b> also gives the list of the twelve<br>
 at this point while Matthew <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:1-4)</i></b> postpones giving the<br>
 names till they are sent out in Galilee. There is a fourth list<br>
 in <!-#-->Ac 1:13. See discussion of the names of the apostles on &#175;Mt<br>
 10:1-4 and pp. 271-3 of my _Harmony of the Gospels for Students<br>
 of the Life of Christ_. The three groups of four begin alike<br>
 <b><i>(Simon, Philip, James)</i></b>. There are some difficulties. <B>{Whom he<br>
 also named apostles}</B> <b><i>(\hous kai apostolous &#333;nomasen\)</i></b>. Margin of<br>
 Revised Version, the text of Westcott and Hort after Aleph, B, C,<br>
 etc. Genuine in <!-#-->Lu 6:13 and probably so here. The meaning is<br>
 that Jesus himself gave the name apostle or missionary<br>
 <b><i>(\apostell&#333;\, to send)</i></b> to this group of twelve. The word is<br>
 applied in the New Testament to others besides as delegates or<br>
 messengers of churches <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 8:23; Php 2:25)</i></b>, and messenger<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 13:16)</i></b>. It is applied also to Paul on a par with the<br>
 twelve <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 1:1,11f., etc.)</i></b> and also to Barnabas <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 14:14)</i></b>,<br>
 and perhaps also to Timothy and Silas <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 2:6f.)</i></b>. Two purposes<br>
 of Jesus are mentioned by Mark in the choice of these twelve,<br>
 <B>{that they might be with him}</B> <b><i>(\hina &#333;sin met' autou\)</i></b>, <B>{and that<br>
 he might send them forth}</B> <b><i>(\kai hina apostell&#275;i autous\)</i></b>. They<br>
 were not ready to be sent forth till they had been with Jesus for<br>
 some time. This is one of the chief tasks of Christ to train this<br>
 group of men. See Bruce's _The Training of the Twelve_. The very<br>
 word \apostolos\ is from \apostell&#333;\. There were two purposes in<br>
 sending them forth expressed by two infinitives, one to preach<br>
 <b><i>(\k&#275;russein\, from \k&#275;rux\, herald)</i></b>, the other to have power to<br>
 cast out demons <b><i>(\echein exousian ekballein ta daimonia\)</i></b>. This<br>
 double ministry of preaching and healing was to mark their work.<br>
 The two things are, however, different, and one does not<br>
 necessarily involve the other.<br>
 <br>
 3:16 <B>{Simon he surnamed Peter}</B> <b><i>(\epeth&#275;ken onoma t&#333;i Sim&#333;ni<br>
 Petron\)</i></b>. The Greek idiom seems awkward, but it is not. Peter is<br>
 in apposition with _name_ or \onoma\ <b><i>(accusative)</i></b>. This surname<br>
 Jesus gave in addition <b><i>(\epeth&#275;ken\)</i></b> to Simon <b><i>(dative case)</i></b>. Here<br>
 then is a direct reference to what is told in <!-#-->Joh 1:42 when<br>
 Jesus met Simon for the first time. Mark here reflects Peter's<br>
 own words. Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:14)</i></b> simply says "Whom he also surnamed<br>
 Peter." See <!-#-->Mt 16:18 for the full explanation of the name<br>
 Peter, a Rock, Cephas.<br>
 <br>
 3:17 <B>{Boanerges, which is Sons of thunder}</B> <b><i>(\Boan&#275;rges ho estin<br>
 huioi bront&#275;s\)</i></b>. This Hebrew nickname is given only by Mark and<br>
 the reason for it is not clear. It may refer to the fiery<br>
 temperament revealed in <!-#-->Lu 9:34 when James and John wanted to<br>
 call down fire on the Samaritan villages that were unfriendly to<br>
 them. The word literally means <B>{sons of tumult, sons of thunder}</B><br>
 in Syriac. No other epithets are given by Mark save descriptions<br>
 to distinguish as Simon the Cananaean <b><i>(or Zealot)</i></b> and Judas<br>
 Iscariot, who also betrayed him <b><i>(verse <!-#-->19)</i></b>. Andrew, <b><i>(from<br>
 \an&#275;r\, a man)</i></b> and Philip <b><i>(Philippos, fond of horses)</i></b> are both<br>
 Greek names. Bartholomew, son of Tolmai, is the Nathanael of<br>
 John's Gospel <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 21:2)</i></b>. He probably had both names. Matthew<br>
 is a Hebrew name meaning gift of God <b><i>(\Maththaios\)</i></b>. Thomas is<br>
 Hebrew and means Twin <b><i>(Didymus, <!-#-->Joh 11:16)</i></b>. There are two uses<br>
 of the name of James <b><i>(\Iac&#333;bos\, Jacob)</i></b>. Thaddeus is another name<br>
 for Lebbaeus.<br>
 <br>
 3:19 <B>{He cometh into a house}</B> <b><i>(\erchetai eis oikon\)</i></b>. Historical<br>
 present again and no article with noun. He comes home from the<br>
 mountain, probably the house of Simon as in <!-#-->1:29. Mark passes<br>
 by the Sermon on the Mount given by Matthew and Luke on the<br>
 mountain <b><i>(plateau on the mountain in Luke)</i></b>. We have to allow a<br>
 reasonable interval for Mark's narrative. Mark's Gospel is full<br>
 of action and does not undertake to tell all that Jesus did and<br>
 said.<br>
 <br>
 3:20 <B>{So that they could not so much as eat bread}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste m&#275;<br>
 dunasthai autous m&#275;de arton phagein\)</i></b>. Note infinitive with<br>
 \h&#333;ste\. Apparently Jesus and the disciples indoors with the<br>
 great crowd in the house and at the door as in <!-#-->1:32; 2:2 to<br>
 which Mark refers by "again." The jam was so great that they<br>
 could not rest, could not eat, and apparently Jesus could not<br>
 even teach. The crowd reassembled at once on Christ's return from<br>
 the mountain.<br>
 <br>
 3:21 <B>{His friends}</B> <b><i>(\hoi par' autou\)</i></b>. The phrase means literally<br>
 "those from the side of him <b><i>(Jesus)</i></b>." It could mean another<br>
 circle of disciples who had just arrived and who knew of the<br>
 crowds and strain of the Galilean ministry who now come at this<br>
 special juncture. But the idiom most likely means the kinspeople<br>
 or family of Jesus as is common in the LXX. The fact that in<br>
 verse <!-#-->31 "his mother and his brothers" are expressly mentioned<br>
 would indicate that they are "the friends" alluded to in verse<br>
 <!-#-->21. It is a mournful spectacle to think of the mother and<br>
 brothers saying, <B>{He is beside himself}</B> <b><i>(\exest&#275;\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active indicative intransitive. The same charge was brought<br>
 against Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 26:24; 2Co 5:13)</i></b>. We say that one is out of<br>
 his head. Certainly Mary did not believe that Jesus was in the<br>
 power of Beelzebub as the rabbis said already. The scribes from<br>
 Jerusalem are trying to discount the power and prestige of Jesus<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->3:22)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 9:32-34; 10:25; 12:24 for Beelzebub and<br>
 Beelzebul. Mary probably felt that Jesus was overwrought and<br>
 wished to take him home out of the excitement and strain that he<br>
 might get rest and proper food. See my _The Mother of Jesus: Her<br>
 Problems and Her Glory_. The brothers did not as yet believe the<br>
 pretensions and claims of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 7:5)</i></b>. Herod Antipas will<br>
 later consider Jesus as John the Baptist _redivivus_, the scribes<br>
 treat him as under demonic possession, even the family and<br>
 friends fear a disordered mind as a result of overstrain. It was<br>
 a crucial moment for Jesus. His family or friends came to take<br>
 him home, to lay hold of him <b><i>(\krat&#275;sai\)</i></b>, forcibly if need be.<br>
 <br>
 3:23 <B>{In parables}</B> <b><i>(\en parabolais\)</i></b>. In crisp pungent thrusts<br>
 that exposed the inconsistencies of the scribes and Pharisees.<br>
 See on &#175;Mt 13 for discussion of the word <B>{parable}</B> <b><i>(\parabol&#275;\,<br>
 placing beside for comparison)</i></b>. These short parabolic quips<br>
 concern Satan's casting out <b><i>(\ekballei\, the very word used of<br>
 casting out demons)</i></b> Satan <b><i>(rhetorical question)</i></b>, a kingdom<br>
 divided <b><i>(\meristh&#275;i\, for a mere portion)</i></b> against itself, a house<br>
 divided <b><i>(\meristh&#275;i\)</i></b> against itself, two conditions of the third<br>
 class undetermined, but with prospect of determination.<br>
 <br>
 3:27 <B>{Spoil}</B> <b><i>(\diarpasai\)</i></b>. Plunder, compound verb, thoroughly<br>
 ransack. Picture of Satan plundering the demons, the very tools<br>
 <b><i>(\skeu&#275;\)</i></b> by which he carried on his business. A _reductio ad<br>
 absurdum_. Jesus is the conqueror of Satan, not in league with<br>
 him.<br>
 <br>
 3:29 <B>{Guilty of an eternal sin}</B> <b><i>(\enochos estin ai&#333;niou<br>
 hamart&#275;matos\)</i></b>. The genitive of the penalty occurs here with<br>
 \enochos\. In saying that Jesus had an unclean spirit <b><i>(verse<br>
 <!-#-->30)</i></b> they had attributed to the devil the work of the Holy<br>
 Spirit. This is the unpardonable sin and it can be committed<br>
 today by men who call the work of Christ the work of the devil,<br>
 Nietzsche may be cited as an instance in point. Those who hope<br>
 for a second probation hereafter may ponder carefully how a soul<br>
 that eternally sins in such an environment can ever repent. That<br>
 is eternal punishment. The text here is \hamart&#275;matos\ <b><i>(sin)</i></b>, not<br>
 \krise&#333;s\ <b><i>(judgment)</i></b>, as the Textus Receptus has it.<br>
 <br>
 3:31 <B>{Standing without}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#333; st&#275;kontes\)</i></b>. A late present from<br>
 the perfect \hest&#275;ka\. Pathetic picture of the mother and<br>
 brothers standing on the outside of the house thinking that Jesus<br>
 inside is beside himself and wanting to take him home. They were<br>
 crowded out. <B>{They sent unto him, calling him}</B> <b><i>(\apesteilan pros<br>
 auton kalountes auton\)</i></b>. They were unwilling to disclose their<br>
 errand to take him home <b><i>(Swete)</i></b> and so get the crowd to pass word<br>
 unto Jesus on the inside, "calling him" through others. Some of<br>
 the MSS. add "sisters" to mother and brothers as seeking Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 3:32 <B>{Was sitting about him}</B> <b><i>(\ekath&#275;to peri auton\)</i></b>. They sat in<br>
 a circle <b><i>(\kukl&#333;i\)</i></b> around Jesus with the disciples forming a<br>
 sort of inner circle.<br>
 <br>
 3:34 <B>{Looking round on them}</B> <b><i>(\periblepsamenos\)</i></b>. Another of<br>
 Mark's life-like touches. Jesus calls those who do the will of<br>
 God his mother, brothers, and sisters. This does not prove that<br>
 the sisters were actually there. The brothers were hostile and<br>
 that gives point to the tragic words of Jesus. One's heart goes<br>
 out to Mary who has to go back home without even seeing her<br>
 wondrous Son. What did it all mean to her at this hour?<br>
