</TD></TR></TABLE>
 <HR>
<p>1:1 <B>{The beginning}</B> <b><i>(\arch&#275;\)</i></b>. There is no article in the Greek.<br>
 It is possible that the phrase served as a heading or title for<br>
 the paragraph about the ministry of the Baptist or as the<br>
 superscription for the whole Gospel <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b> placed either by Mark<br>
 or a scribe. And then the Gospel of Jesus Christ means the<br>
 Message about Jesus Christ <b><i>(objective genitive)</i></b>. The word Gospel<br>
 here <b><i>(\euaggelion\)</i></b> comes close to meaning the record itself as<br>
 told by Mark. Swete notes that each writer has a different<br>
 starting point <b><i>(\arch&#275;\)</i></b>. Mark, as the earliest form of the<br>
 evangelic tradition, begins with the work of the Baptist, Matthew<br>
 with the ancestry and birth of the Messiah, Luke with the birth<br>
 of the Baptist, John with the Preincarnate Logos, Paul with the<br>
 foundation of each of the churches <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 4:15)</i></b>. <B>{The Son of God}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Huiou theou\)</i></b>. Aleph 28, 255 omit these words, but B, D, L,<br>
 have them and the great mass of the manuscripts have \huiou tou<br>
 theou\. If this is a heading added to what Mark wrote, the<br>
 heading may have existed early in two forms, one with, one<br>
 without "Son of God." If Mark wrote the words, there is no reason<br>
 to doubt the genuineness since he uses the phrase elsewhere.<br>
 <br>
 1:2 <B>{In Isaiah, the prophet}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i Esai&#257;i t&#333;i proph&#275;t&#275;i\)</i></b>. The<br>
 quotation comes from <!-#-->Mal 3:1 and <!-#-->Isa 40:3. The Western and<br>
 Neutral classes read Isaiah, the Alexandrian and Syrian, "the<br>
 prophets," an evident correction because part of it is from<br>
 Malachi. But Isaiah is mentioned as the chief of the prophets. It<br>
 was common to combine quotations from the prophets in<br>
 _testimonia_ and _catenae_ <b><i>(chains of quotations)</i></b>. This is Mark's<br>
 only prophetic quotation on his own account <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:3 <B>{The voice of one crying}</B> <b><i>(\phon&#275; bo&#333;ntos\)</i></b>. God is coming to<br>
 his people to deliver them from their captivity in Babylon. So<br>
 the prophet cries like a voice in the wilderness to make ready<br>
 for the coming of God. When the committee from the Sanhedrin came<br>
 to ask John who he was, he used this very language of Isaiah<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:23)</i></b>. He was only a voice, but we can still hear the echo<br>
 of that voice through the corridor of the centuries. <B>{Paths<br>
 straight}</B> <b><i>(\eutheias tas tribous\)</i></b>. Automobile highways today<br>
 well illustrate the wonderful Persian roads for the couriers of<br>
 the king and then for the king himself. The Roman Empire was knit<br>
 together by roads, some of which survive today. John had a high<br>
 and holy mission as the forerunner of the Messiah.<br>
 <br>
 1:4 <B>{John came}</B> <b><i>(\egeneto I&#333;an&#275;s\)</i></b>. His coming was an epoch<br>
 <b><i>(\egeneto\)</i></b>, not a mere event <b><i>(\&#275;n\)</i></b>. His coming was in<br>
 accordance with the prophetic picture <b><i>(\kath&#333;s\, <!-#-->1:2)</i></b>. Note the<br>
 same verb about John in <!-#-->Joh 1:6. The coming of John the<br>
 Baptizer was the real beginning of the spoken message about<br>
 Christ. He is described as <B>{the baptizing one}</B> <b><i>(\ho haptiz&#333;n\)</i></b> in<br>
 the wilderness <b><i>(\en t&#275;i er&#275;m&#333;i\)</i></b>. The baptizing took place in the<br>
 River Jordan <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:5,9)</i></b> which was included in the general term<br>
 the wilderness or the deserted region of Judea. <B>{Preached the<br>
 baptism of repentance}</B> <b><i>(\k&#275;russ&#333;n baptisma metanoias\)</i></b>. Heralded<br>
 a repentance kind of baptism <b><i>(genitive case, genus case)</i></b>, a<br>
 baptism marked by repentance. See on &#175;Mt 3:2 for discussion of<br>
 repent, an exceedingly poor rendering of John's great word<br>
 \metanoias\. He called upon the Jews to change their minds and to<br>
 turn from their sins, "confessing their sins" <b><i>(\exomologoumenoi<br>
 tas hamartias aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mt 3:16. The public confessions<br>
 produced a profound impression as they would now. <B>{Unto remission<br>
 of sins}</B> <b><i>(\eis aphesin hamarti&#333;n\)</i></b>. This is a difficult phrase to<br>
 translate accurately. Certainly John did not mean that the<br>
 baptism was the means of obtaining the forgiveness of their sins<br>
 or necessary to the remission of sins. The trouble lies in the<br>
 use of \eis\ which sometimes is used when purpose is expressed,<br>
 but sometimes when there is no such idea as in <!-#-->Mt 10:41 and <!-#-->Mt<br>
 12:41. Probably "with reference to" is as good a translation<br>
 here as is possible. The baptism was on the basis of the<br>
 repentance and confession of sin and, as Paul later explained<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 6:4)</i></b>, was a picture of the death to sin and resurrection to<br>
 new life in Christ. This symbol was already in use by the Jews<br>
 for proselytes who became Jews. John is treating the Jewish<br>
 nation as pagans who need to repent, to confess their sins, and<br>
 to come back to the kingdom of God. The baptism in the Jordan was<br>
 the objective challenge to the people.<br>
 <br>
 1:5 <B>{Then went out unto him}</B> <b><i>(\exeporeueto pros auton\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect indicative describing the steady stream of people who<br>
 kept coming to the baptism <b><i>(\ebaptizonto\, imperfect passive<br>
 indicative, a wonderful sight)</i></b>. <B>{In the river Jordan}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i<br>
 Iordan&#275;i potam&#333;i\)</i></b>. In the Jordan river, literally.<br>
 <br>
 1:6 <B>{Clothed with camel's hair}</B> <b><i>(\endedumenos trichas kam&#275;lou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Matthew <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 3:4)</i></b> has it a garment <b><i>(\enduma\)</i></b> of camel's hair.<br>
 Mark has it in the accusative plural the object of the perfect<br>
 passive participle retained according to a common Greek idiom. It<br>
 was, of course, not camel's skin, but rough cloth woven of<br>
 camel's hair. For the locusts and wild honey, see on &#175;Mt 3:4.<br>
 Dried locusts are considered palatable and the wild honey, or<br>
 "mountain honey" as some versions give it <b><i>(\meli agrion\)</i></b>, was<br>
 bountiful in the clefts of the rocks. Some Bedouins make their<br>
 living yet by gathering this wild honey out of the rocks.<br>
 <br>
 1:7 <B>{Mightier than I}</B> <b><i>(\ho ischuroteros mou\)</i></b>. In each of the<br>
 Synoptics. Gould calls it a skeptical depreciation of himself by<br>
 John. But it was sincere on John's part and he gives a reason for<br>
 it. <B>{The Latchet}</B> <b><i>(\ton himanta\)</i></b>. The thong of the sandal which<br>
 held it together. When the guest comes into the house, performed<br>
 by a slave before one enters the bath. Mark alone gives this<br>
 touch.<br>
 <br>
 1:8 <B>{With water}</B> <b><i>(\hudati\)</i></b>. So Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 3:16)</i></b> the locative<br>
 case, <B>{in water}</B>. Matthew <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 3:11)</i></b> has \en\ <b><i>(in)</i></b>, both with<br>
 <b><i>(in)</i></b> water and the Holy Spirit. The water baptism by John was a<br>
 symbol of the spiritual baptism by Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 1:9 <B>{In the Jordan}</B> <b><i>(\eis ton Iordan&#275;n\)</i></b>. So in verse <!-#-->10, \ek<br>
 tou hudatos\, out of the water, after the baptism into the<br>
 Jordan. Mark is as fond of "straightway" <b><i>(\euthus\)</i></b> as Matthew is<br>
 of "then" <b><i>(\tote\)</i></b>. <B>{Rent asunder}</B> <b><i>(\schizomenous\)</i></b>. Split like a<br>
 garment, present passive participle. Jesus saw the heavens<br>
 parting as he came up out of the water, a more vivid picture than<br>
 the "opened" in <!-#-->Mt 3:16 and <!-#-->Lu 3:21. Evidently the Baptist<br>
 saw all this and the Holy Spirit coming down upon Jesus as a dove<br>
 because he later mentions it <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:32)</i></b>. The Cerinthian<br>
 Gnostics took the dove to mean the heavenly _aeon Christ_ that<br>
 here descended upon the man Jesus and remained with him till the<br>
 Cross when it left him, a sort of forecast of the modern<br>
 distinction between the Jesus of history and the theological<br>
 Christ.<br>
 <br>
 1:11 <B>{Thou art}</B> <b><i>(\su ei\)</i></b>. So <!-#-->Lu 3:22. <!-#-->Mt 3:17 has <B>{this is}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\houtos estin\)</i></b> which see. So both Mark and Luke have "in thee,"<br>
 while Matthew has "in whom."<br>
 <br>
 1:12 <B>{Driveth him forth}</B> <b><i>(\auton ekballei\)</i></b>. Vivid word, bolder<br>
 than Matthew's "was led up" <b><i>(\an&#275;chth&#275;\)</i></b> and Luke's "was led"<br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;geto\)</i></b>. It is the same word employed in the driving out of<br>
 demons <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:34,39)</i></b>. Mark has here "straightway" where Matthew<br>
 has "then" <b><i>(see on verse &#175;9)</i></b>. The forty days in the wilderness<br>
 were under the direct guidance of the Holy Spirit. The entire<br>
 earthly life of Jesus was bound up with the Holy Spirit from his<br>
 birth to his death and resurrection.<br>
 <br>
 1:13 <B>{With the wild beasts}</B> <b><i>(\meta t&#333;u th&#275;ri&#333;n\)</i></b>. Mark does not<br>
 give the narrative of the three temptations in Matthew and Luke<br>
 <b><i>(apparently from the Logia and originally, of course, from Jesus<br>
 himself)</i></b>. But Mark adds this little touch about the wild beasts<br>
 in the wilderness. It was the haunt at night of the wolf, the<br>
 boar, the hyena, the jackal, the leopard. It was lonely and<br>
 depressing in its isolation and even dangerous. Swete notes that<br>
 in <!-#-->Ps 90:13 the promise of victory over the wild beasts comes<br>
 immediately after that of angelic guardianship cited by Satan in<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 4:6. The angels did come and minister <b><i>(\di&#275;konoun\)</i></b>,<br>
 imperfect tense, kept it up till he was cheered and strengthened.<br>
 Dr. Tristram observes that some Abyssinian Christians are in the<br>
 habit of coming to the Quarantania during Lent and fasting forty<br>
 days on the summit amid the ruins of its ancient cells and<br>
 chapels where they suppose Jesus was tempted. But we are all<br>
 tempted of the devil in the city even worse than in the desert.<br>
 <br>
 1:14 <B>{Jesus came into Galilee}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;lthen ho I&#275;sous eis t&#275;n<br>
 Galilaian\)</i></b>. Here Mark begins the narrative of the active<br>
 ministry of Jesus and he is followed by Matthew and Luke. Mark<br>
 undoubtedly follows the preaching of Peter. But for the Fourth<br>
 Gospel we should not know of the year of work in various parts of<br>
 the land <b><i>(Perea, Galilee, Judea, Samaria)</i></b> preceding the Galilean<br>
 ministry. John supplements the Synoptic Gospels at this point as<br>
 often. The arrest of John had much to do with the departure of<br>
 Jesus from Judea to Galilee <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 4:1-4)</i></b>. <B>{Preaching the gospel<br>
 of God}</B> <b><i>(\k&#275;russ&#333;n to euaggelion tou theou\)</i></b>. It is the<br>
 subjective genitive, the gospel that comes from God. Swete<br>
 observes that repentance <b><i>(\metanoia\)</i></b> is the keynote in the<br>
 message of the Baptist as gospel <b><i>(\euaggelion\)</i></b> is with Jesus.<br>
 But Jesus took the same line as John and proclaimed both<br>
 repentance and the arrival of the kingdom of God. Mark adds to<br>
 Matthew's report the words "the time is fulfilled" <b><i>(\pepl&#275;r&#333;tai<br>
 ho kairos\)</i></b>. It is a significant fact that John looks backward to<br>
 the promise of the coming of the Messiah and signalizes the<br>
 fulfilment as near at hand <b><i>(perfect passive indicative)</i></b>. It is<br>
 like Paul's fulness of time <b><i>(\pl&#275;r&#333;ma tou chronou\)</i></b> in <!-#-->Ga 4:4<br>
 and fulness of the times <b><i>(\pl&#275;r&#333;ma ton kair&#333;n\)</i></b> in <!-#-->Eph 1:10<br>
 when he employs the word \kairos\, opportunity or crisis as here<br>
 in Mark rather than the more general term \chronos\. Mark adds<br>
 here also: "and believe in the gospel" <b><i>(\kai pisteuete en t&#333;i<br>
 euaggeli&#333;i\)</i></b>. Both repent and believe in the gospel. Usually<br>
 faith in Jesus <b><i>(or God)</i></b> is expected as in <!-#-->John 14:1. But this<br>
 crisis called for faith in the message of Jesus that the Messiah<br>
 had come. He did not use here the term Messiah, for it had come<br>
 to have political connotations that made its use at present<br>
 unwise. But the kingdom of God had arrived with the presence of<br>
 the King. It does make a difference what one believes. Belief or<br>
 disbelief in the message of Jesus made a sharp cleavage in those<br>
 who heard him. "Faith in the message was the first step; a creed<br>
 of some kind lies at the basis of confidence in the Person of<br>
 Christ, and the occurrence of the phrase \pistuete en t&#333;i<br>
 euaggeli&#333;i\ in the oldest record of the teaching of our Lord is a<br>
 valuable witness to this fact" <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:16 <B>{And passing along by the Sea of Galilee}</B> <b><i>(\kai parag&#333;n para<br>
 t&#275;n thalassan t&#275;s Galilaias\)</i></b>. Mark uses \para\ <b><i>(along, beside)</i></b><br>
 twice and makes the picture realistic. He catches this glimpse of<br>
 Christ in action. Casting a <B>{net}</B> <b><i>(\amphiballontas\)</i></b>. Literally<br>
 casting on both sides, now on one side, now on the other. Matthew<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 4:18)</i></b> has a different phrase which see. There are two<br>
 papyri examples of the verb \amphiball&#333;\, one verb absolutely for<br>
 fishing as here, the other with the accusative. It is fishing<br>
 with a net, making a cast, a haul. These four disciples were<br>
 fishermen <b><i>(\halieis\)</i></b> and were <B>{partners}</B> <b><i>(\metochoi\)</i></b> as Luke<br>
 states <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 5:7)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:17 <B>{Become}</B> <b><i>(\genesthai\)</i></b>. Mark has this word not in Matthew.<br>
 It would be a slow and long process, but Jesus could and would do<br>
 it. He would undertake to make fishers of men out of fishermen.<br>
 Preachers are made out of laymen who are willing to leave their<br>
 business for service for Christ.<br>
 <br>
 1:19 <B>{A little further}</B> <b><i>(\oligon\)</i></b>. A Marcan detail. <B>{Mending<br>
 their nets}</B> <b><i>(\katartizontas ta diktua\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 4:21.<br>
 Getting ready that they might succeed better at the next haul.<br>
 <br>
 1:20 <B>{With the hired servants}</B> <b><i>(\meta t&#333;n misth&#333;t&#333;n\)</i></b>. One hired<br>
 for wages <b><i>(\misthos\)</i></b>, a very old Greek word. Zebedee and his two<br>
 sons evidently had an extensive business in co-operation with<br>
 Andrew and Simon <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 5:7,10)</i></b>. Mark alone has this detail of the<br>
 hired servants left with Zebedee. They left the boat and their<br>
 father <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 4:22)</i></b> with the hired servants. The business would go<br>
 on while they left all <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 5:11)</i></b> and became permanent followers<br>
 of Jesus. Many a young man has faced precisely this problem when<br>
 he entered the ministry. Could he leave father and mother,<br>
 brothers and sisters, while he went forth to college and seminary<br>
 to become a fisher of men? Not the least of the sacrifices made<br>
 in the education of young preachers is that made by the home<br>
 folks who have additional burdens to bear because the young<br>
 preacher is no longer a bread-winner at home. Most young<br>
 preachers joyfully carry on such burdens after entering the<br>
 ministry.<br>
 <br>
 1:21 <B>{And taught}</B> <b><i>(\edidasken\)</i></b>. Inchoative imperfect, began to<br>
 teach as soon as he entered the synagogue in Capernaum on the<br>
 sabbath. The synagogue in Capernaum afforded the best opening for<br>
 the teaching of Jesus. He had now made Capernaum <b><i>(Tell Hum)</i></b> his<br>
 headquarters after the rejection in Nazareth as explained in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 4:16-31 and <!-#-->Mt 4:13-16. The ruins of this synagogue have been<br>
 discovered and there is even talk of restoring the building since<br>
 the stones are in a good state of preservation. Jesus both taught<br>
 <b><i>(\didask&#333;\)</i></b> and preached <b><i>(\k&#275;russ&#333;\)</i></b> in the Jewish synagogues as<br>
 opportunity was offered by the chief or leader of the synagogue<br>
 <b><i>(\archisunag&#333;gos\)</i></b>. The service consisted of prayer, praise,<br>
 reading of scripture, and exposition by any rabbi or other<br>
 competent person. Often Paul was invited to speak at such<br>
 meetings. In <!-#-->Lu 4:20 Jesus gave back the roll of Isaiah to the<br>
 attendant or beadle <b><i>(\t&#333;i hup&#275;ret&#275;i\)</i></b> whose business it was to<br>
 bring out the precious manuscript and return it to its place.<br>
 Jesus was a preacher of over a year when he began to teach in the<br>
 Capernaum synagogue. His reputation had preceded him <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 4:14)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:22 <B>{They were astonished}</B> <b><i>(\exepl&#275;ssonto\)</i></b>. Pictorial imperfect<br>
 as in <!-#-->Lu 4:32 describing the amazement of the audience,<br>
 "meaning strictly to strike a person out of his senses by some<br>
 strong feeling, such as fear, wonder, or even joy" <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>. <B>{And<br>
 not as their scribes}</B> <b><i>(\kai ouch h&#333;s hoi grammateis\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu 4:32<br>
 has only "with authority" <b><i>(\en exousi&#257;i\)</i></b>. Mark has it "as having<br>
 authority" <b><i>(\h&#333;s ech&#333;n exousian\)</i></b>. He struck a note not found by<br>
 the rabbi. They quoted other rabbis and felt their function to be<br>
 expounders of the traditions which they made a millstone around<br>
 the necks of the people. By so doing they set aside the word and<br>
 will of God by their traditions and petty legalism <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 7:9,13)</i></b>.<br>
 They were casuists and made false interpretations to prove their<br>
 punctilious points of external etiquette to the utter neglect of<br>
 the spiritual reality. The people noticed at once that here was a<br>
 personality who got his power <b><i>(authority)</i></b> direct from God, not<br>
 from the current scribes. "Mark omits much, and is in many ways a<br>
 meagre Gospel, but it makes a distinctive contribution to the<br>
 evangelic history _in showing by a few realistic touches_ <b><i>(this<br>
 one of them)</i></b> _the remarkable personality of Jesus_" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. See<br>
 on <!-#-->Mt 7:29 for the like impression made by the Sermon on the<br>
 Mount where the same language occurs. The chief controversy in<br>
 Christ's life was with these scribes, the professional teachers<br>
 of the oral law and mainly Pharisees. At once the people see that<br>
 Jesus stands apart from the old group. He made a sensation in the<br>
 best sense of that word. There was a buzz of excitement at the<br>
 new teacher that was increased by the miracle that followed the<br>
 sermon.<br>
 <br>
 1:23 <B>{With an unclean spirit}</B> <b><i>(\en pneumati akathart&#333;i\)</i></b>. This<br>
 use of \en\ "with" is common in the Septuagint like the Hebrew<br>
 _be_, but it occurs also in the papyri. It is the same idiom as<br>
 "in Christ," "in the Lord" so common with Paul. In English we<br>
 speak of our being in love, in drink, in his cups, etc. The<br>
 unclean spirit was in the man and the man in the unclean spirit,<br>
 a man in the power of the unclean spirit. Luke has "having," the<br>
 usual construction. See on &#175;Mt 22:43. Unclean spirit is used as<br>
 synonymous with <B>{demon}</B> <b><i>(\daimonion\)</i></b>. It is the idea of<br>
 estrangement from God <b><i>(<!-#-->Zec 13:2)</i></b>. The whole subject of<br>
 demonology is difficult, but no more so than the problem of the<br>
 devil. Jesus distinguishes between the man and the unclean<br>
 spirit. Usually physical or mental disease accompanied the<br>
 possession by demons. One wonders today if the degenerates and<br>
 confirmed criminals so common now are not under the power of<br>
 demons. The only cure for confirmed criminals seems to be<br>
 conversion <b><i>(a new heart)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:24 <B>{What have we to do with thee?}</B> <b><i>(\ti h&#275;min kai soi?\)</i></b> The<br>
 same idiom in <!-#-->Mt 8:29. Ethical dative. Nothing in common<br>
 between the demon and Jesus. Note "we." The man speaks for the<br>
 demon and himself, double personality. The recognition of Jesus<br>
 by the demons may surprise us since the rabbis <b><i>(the<br>
 ecclesiastics)</i></b> failed to do so. They call Jesus "The Holy One of<br>
 God" <b><i>(\ho hagios tou theou\)</i></b>. Hence the demon feared that Jesus<br>
 was come to destroy him and the man in his power. In <!-#-->Mt 8:29<br>
 the demon calls Jesus "Son of God." Later the disciples will call<br>
 Jesus "The Holy One of God" <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:69)</i></b>. The demon cried out<br>
 aloud <b><i>(\anekraxen\, late first aorist form, \anekragen\, common<br>
 second aorist)</i></b> so that all heard the strange testimony to Jesus.<br>
 The man says "I know" <b><i>(\oida\)</i></b>, correct text, some manuscripts<br>
 "we know" <b><i>(\oidamen\)</i></b>, including the demon.<br>
 <br>
 1:25 <B>{Hold thy peace}</B> <b><i>(\phim&#333;th&#275;ti\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 imperative of \phimo&#333;\. "Be quiet," Moffatt translates it. But it<br>
 is a more vigorous word, "Be muzzled" like an ox. So literally in<br>
 <!-#-->De 25:4, 1Co 9:9; 1Ti 5:18. It is common in Josephus, Lucian,<br>
 and the LXX. See <!-#-->Mt 22:12,34. Gould renders it "Shut up." "Shut<br>
 your mouth" would be too colloquial. Vincent suggests "gagged,"<br>
 but that is more the idea of \epistomazein\ in <!-#-->Tit 1:11, to<br>
 stop the mouth.<br>
 <br>
 1:26 <B>{Tearing him}</B> <b><i>(\sparaxan auton\)</i></b>. Margin, <B>{convulsing him}</B><br>
 like a spasm. Medical writers use the word for the rotating of<br>
 the stomach. <!-#-->Lu 4:35 adds "when the demon had thrown him down<br>
 in the midst." Mark mentions the "loud voice" <b><i>(\phon&#275;i megal&#275;i\)</i></b>,<br>
 a screech, in fact. It was a moment of intense excitement.<br>
 <br>
 1:27 <B>{They questioned among themselves}</B> <b><i>(\sunz&#275;tein autous\)</i></b>. By<br>
 look and word. <B>{A new teaching}</B> <b><i>(\didach&#275; kain&#275;\)</i></b>. One surprise<br>
 had followed another this day. The teaching was fresh <b><i>(\kain&#275;\)</i></b>,<br>
 original as the dew of the morning on the blossoms just blown.<br>
 That was a novelty in that synagogue where only staid and stilted<br>
 rabbinical rules had been heretofore droned out. This new<br>
 teaching charmed the people, but soon will be rated as heresy by<br>
 the rabbis. And it was with authority <b><i>(\kat' exousian\)</i></b>. It is<br>
 not certain whether the phrase is to be taken with "new<br>
 teaching," "It's new teaching with authority behind it," as<br>
 Moffatt has it, or with the verb; "with authority commandeth even<br>
 the unclean spirits" <b><i>(\kai tois pneumasin tois akathartois<br>
 epitassei\)</i></b>. The position is equivocal and may be due to the fact<br>
 that "Mark gives the incoherent and excited remarks of the crowd<br>
 in this natural form" <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. But the most astonishing thing of<br>
 all is that the demons "obey him" <b><i>(\hupakouousin aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. The<br>
 people were accustomed to the use of magical formulae by the<br>
 Jewish exorcists <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 12:27; Ac 19:13)</i></b>, but here was something<br>
 utterly different. Simon Magus could not understand how Simon<br>
 Peter could do his miracles without some secret trick and even<br>
 offered to buy it <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 8:19)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:28 <B>{The report of him}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; ako&#275; autou\)</i></b>. Vulgate, _rumor_. See<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 14:1; 24:6. They had no telephones, telegraphs, newspapers<br>
 or radio, but news has a marvellous way of spreading by word of<br>
 mouth. The fame of this new teacher went out "everywhere"<br>
 <b><i>(\pantachou\)</i></b> throughout all Galilee.<br>
 <br>
 1:29 <B>{The house of Simon and Andrew}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n oikian Sim&#333;nos kai<br>
 Andreou\)</i></b>. Peter was married and both he and Andrew lived<br>
 together in "Peter's house" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 8:14)</i></b> with Peter's wife and<br>
 mother-in-law. Peter was evidently married before he began to<br>
 follow Jesus. Later his wife accompanied him on his apostolic<br>
 journeys <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 9:5)</i></b>. This incident followed immediately after<br>
 the service in the synagogue on the sabbath. All the Synoptics<br>
 give it. Mark heard Peter tell it as it occurred in his own house<br>
 where Jesus made his home while in Capernaum. Each Gospel gives<br>
 touches of its own to the story. Mark has "lay sick of a fever "<br>
 <b><i>(\katekeito puressousa\)</i></b>, lay prostrate burning with fever.<br>
 Matthew puts it "stretched out <b><i>(\bebl&#275;men&#275;n\)</i></b> with a fever." Luke<br>
 has it "holden with a great fever" <b><i>(\&#275;n sunechomen&#275; puret&#333;i<br>
 megal&#333;i\)</i></b>, a technical medical phrase. They all mention the<br>
 instant recovery and ministry without any convalescence. Mark and<br>
 Matthew speak of the touch of Jesus on her hand and Luke speaks<br>
 of Jesus standing over her like a doctor. It was a tender scene.<br>
 <br>
 1:32 <B>{When the sun did set}</B> <b><i>(\hote edusen ho h&#275;lios\)</i></b>. This<br>
 picturesque detail Mark has besides "at even" <b><i>(\opsias<br>
 genomen&#275;s\, genitive absolute, evening having come)</i></b>. Matthew has<br>
 "when even was come," Luke "when the sun was setting." The<br>
 sabbath ended at sunset and so the people were now at liberty to<br>
 bring their sick to Jesus. The news about the casting out of the<br>
 demon and the healing of Peter's mother-in-law had spread all<br>
 over Capernaum. They brought them in a steady stream <b><i>(imperfect<br>
 tense, \epheron\)</i></b>. Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 4:40)</i></b> adds that Jesus laid his hand<br>
 on every one of them as they passed by in grateful procession.<br>
 <br>
 1:33 <B>{At the door}</B> <b><i>(\pros t&#275;n thuran\)</i></b>. At the door of Peter's<br>
 house. The whole city was gathered together there <b><i>(&#275;n<br>
 episun&#275;gmen&#275;, past perfect passive periphrastic indicative,<br>
 double compound \epi\ and \sun\)</i></b>. Mark alone mentions this vivid<br>
 detail. He is seeing with Peter's eyes again. Peter no doubt<br>
 watched the beautiful scene with pride and gratitude as Jesus<br>
 stood in the door and healed the great crowds in the glory of<br>
 that sunset. He loved to tell it afterwards. <B>{Divers diseases}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\poikilais nosois\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mt 4:24 about \poikilos\ meaning<br>
 many-coloured, variegated. All sorts of sick folk came and were<br>
 healed.<br>
 <br>
 1:34 <B>{Devils}</B> <b><i>(\daimonia\)</i></b>. Demons it should be translated<br>
 always. <B>{Suffered not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk &#275;phien\)</i></b>. Would not allow, imperfect<br>
 tense of continued refusal. The reason given is "because they<br>
 knew him" <b><i>(\hoti &#275;ideisan auton\)</i></b>. Whether "to be Christ"<br>
 <b><i>(\Christon einai\)</i></b> is genuine or not, that is the meaning and is<br>
 a direct reference to <!-#-->1:24 when in the synagogue the demon<br>
 recognized and addressed Jesus as the Holy One of God. Testimony<br>
 from such a source was not calculated to help the cause of Christ<br>
 with the people. He had told the other demon to be silent. See on<br>
 &#175;Mt 8:29 for discussion of the word demon.<br>
 <br>
 1:35 <B>{In the morning, a great while before day}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;i ennucha<br>
 lian\)</i></b>. Luke has only "when it was day" <b><i>(\genomen&#275;s h&#275;meras\)</i></b>.<br>
 The word \pr&#333;i\ in Mark means the last watch of the night from<br>
 three to six A.M. \Ennucha lian\ means in the early part of the<br>
 watch while it was still a bit dark <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mr 16:2 \lian pr&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Rose up and went out}</B> <b><i>(\anastas ex&#275;lthen\)</i></b>. Out of the house and<br>
 out of the city, off <b><i>(\ap&#275;lthen\, even if not genuine, possibly a<br>
 conflate reading from <!-#-->6:32,46)</i></b>. "Flight from the unexpected<br>
 reality into which His ideal conception of His calling had<br>
 brought Him" <b><i>(H.J. Holtzmann)</i></b>. Gould notes that Jesus seems to<br>
 retreat before his sudden popularity, to prayer with the Father<br>
 "that he might not be ensnared by this popularity, or in any way<br>
 induced to accept the ways of ease instead of duty." But Jesus<br>
 also had a plan for a preaching tour of Galilee and "He felt He<br>
 could not begin too soon. He left in the night, fearing<br>
 opposition from the people" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Surely many a popular<br>
 preacher can understand this mood of Jesus when in the night he<br>
 slips away to a solitary place for prayer. Jesus knew what it was<br>
 to spend a whole night in prayer. He knew the blessing of prayer<br>
 and the power of prayer. <B>{And there prayed}</B> <b><i>(\k'akei<br>
 pros&#275;ucheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense picturing Jesus as praying through<br>
 the early morning hours.<br>
 <br>
 1:36 <B>{Followed after him}</B> <b><i>(\katedi&#333;xen auton\)</i></b>. Hunted him out<br>
 <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>. Perfective use of the preposition \kata\ <b><i>(down to the<br>
 finish)</i></b>. The verb \di&#333;k&#333;\ is used for the hunt or chase, pursuit.<br>
 Vulgate has _persecutus est_. The personal story of Peter comes<br>
 in here. "Simon's intention at least was good; the Master seemed<br>
 to be losing precious opportunities and must be brought back"<br>
 <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. Peter and those with him kept up the search till they<br>
 found him. The message that they brought would surely bring Jesus<br>
 back to Peter's house.<br>
 <br>
 1:38 <B>{Into the next towns}</B> <b><i>(\eis tas echomenas k&#333;mopoleis\)</i></b>. It<br>
 was a surprising decision for Jesus to leave the eager, excited<br>
 throngs in Capernaum for the country town or village cities<br>
 without walls or much importance. Only instance of the word in<br>
 the N.T. Late Greek word. The use of \echomenas\ for next is a<br>
 classic use meaning clinging to, next to a thing. So in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 13:33; Ac 13:44; 20:15; Heb 6:9. "D" here has \eggus\ <b><i>(near)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:39 <B>{Throughout all Galilee}</B> <b><i>(\Eis hol&#275;n t&#275;n Galilaian\)</i></b>. The<br>
 first tour of Galilee by Jesus. We are told little about this<br>
 great preaching tour.<br>
 <br>
 1:40 <B>{Kneeling down to him}</B> <b><i>(\kai gonupet&#333;n\)</i></b>. Picturesque detail<br>
 omitted by some MSS. <!-#-->Lu 5:12 has "fell on his face."<br>
 <br>
 1:41 <B>{Being moved with compassion}</B> <b><i>(\splagchnistheis\)</i></b>. Only in<br>
 Mark. First aorist passive participle.<br>
 <br>
 1:43 <B>{Strictly charged}</B> <b><i>(\embrim&#275;samenos\)</i></b>. Only in Mark. <!-#-->Lu<br>
 5:14 has \par&#275;ggeilen\ <b><i>(commanded)</i></b>. Mark's word occurs also in<br>
 <!-#-->14:5 and in <!-#-->Mt 9:30 and <!-#-->Joh 11:38. See on &#175;Mt 9:30. It is<br>
 a strong word for the snorting of a horse and expresses powerful<br>
 emotion as Jesus stood here face to face with leprosy, itself a<br>
 symbol of sin and all its train of evils. The command to report<br>
 to the priests was in accord with the Mosaic regulations and the<br>
 prohibition against talking about it was to allay excitement and<br>
 to avoid needless opposition to Christ.<br>
 <br>
 1:44 <B>{For a testimony unto them}</B> <b><i>(\eis marturion autois\)</i></b>.<br>
 Without the formal testimony of the priests the people would not<br>
 receive the leper as officially clean.<br>
 <br>
 1:45 <B>{Began to publish it much}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rxato k&#275;russein polla\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu<br>
 5:15 puts it, "so much the more" <b><i>(\m&#257;llon\)</i></b>. One of the best<br>
 ways to spread a thing is to tell people not to tell. It was<br>
 certainly so in this case. Soon Jesus had to avoid cities and<br>
 betake himself to desert places to avoid the crowds and even then<br>
 people kept coming to Jesus <b><i>(\&#275;rchonto\, imperfect tense)</i></b>. Some<br>
 preachers are not so disturbed by the onrush of crowds.<br>
