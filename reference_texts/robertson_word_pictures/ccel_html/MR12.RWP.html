<p>12:1 <B>{He began to speak unto them in parables}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rxato autois en<br>
 parabolais lalein\)</i></b>. Mark's common idiom again. He does not mean<br>
 that this was the beginning of Christ's use of parables <b><i>(see<br>
 <!-#-->4:2)</i></b>, but simply that his teaching on this occasion took the<br>
 parabolic turn. "The circumstances called forth the parabolic<br>
 mood, that of one whose heart is chilled, and whose spirit is<br>
 saddened by a sense of loneliness, and who, retiring within<br>
 himself, by a process of reflection, frames for his thoughts<br>
 forms which half conceal, half reveal them" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Mark does<br>
 not give the Parable of the Two Sons <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 21:28-32)</i></b> nor that of<br>
 the Marriage Feast of the King's Son <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 22:1-14)</i></b>. He gives<br>
 here the Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen. Also in <!-#-->Mt 21:33-46<br>
 and <!-#-->Lu 20:9-19. See discussion in Matthew. <!-#-->Mt 21:33 calls the<br>
 man "a householder" <b><i>(\oikodespot&#275;s\)</i></b>. <B>{A pit for the winepress}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hupol&#275;nion\)</i></b>. Only here in the N.T. Common in the LXX and in<br>
 late Greek. Matthew had \l&#275;non\, winepress. This is the vessel or<br>
 trough under the winepress on the hillside to catch the juice<br>
 when the grapes were trodden. The Romans called it _lacus_ <b><i>(lake)</i></b><br>
 and Wycliff _dalf_ <b><i>(lake)</i></b>, like delved. See on Matthew for<br>
 details just alike. <B>{Husbandmen}</B> <b><i>(\ge&#333;rgois\)</i></b>. Workers in the<br>
 ground, tillers of the soil <b><i>(\ergon, g&#275;\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:2 <B>{At the season}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i kair&#333;i\)</i></b>. For fruits as in the end of<br>
 the sentence. <B>{A servant}</B> <b><i>(\doulon\)</i></b>. Bondslave. Matthew has<br>
 plural. <B>{That he might receive}</B> <b><i>(\hina lab&#275;i\)</i></b>. Purpose clause<br>
 with second aorist subjunctive. Matthew has infinitive \labein\,<br>
 purpose also. <B>{Wounded in the head}</B> <b><i>(\ekephali&#333;san\)</i></b>. An old verb<br>
 <b><i>(\kephalai&#333;\)</i></b>, to bring under heads <b><i>(\kephal&#275;\)</i></b>, to summarize.<br>
 Then to hit on the head. Only here in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 12:5 <B>{Beating some and killing some}</B> <b><i>(\hous men derontes, hous de<br>
 apoktennuntes\)</i></b>. This distributive use of the demonstrative<br>
 appears also in <!-#-->Mt 21:35 in the singular <b><i>(\hon men, hon de, hon<br>
 de\)</i></b>. Originally \der&#333;\ in Homer meant to skin, flay, then to<br>
 smite, to beat. \Apoktennuntes\ is a \mi\ form of the verb<br>
 <b><i>(\apoktennumi\)</i></b> and means to kill off.<br>
 <br>
 12:6 <B>{A beloved son}</B> <b><i>(\huion agap&#275;ton\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu 20:13 has \ton<br>
 huion ton agap&#275;ton\. Jesus evidently has in mind the language of<br>
 the Father to him at his baptism <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:11; Mt 3:17; Lu 3:22)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Last}</B> <b><i>(\eschaton\)</i></b>. Only in Mark. See on &#175;Mt 21:37 for<br>
 discussion of "reverence."<br>
 <br>
 12:7 <B>{Among themselves}</B> <b><i>(\pros heautous\)</i></b>. This phrase alone in<br>
 Mark. <!-#-->Lu 20:14 has "with one another" <b><i>(\pros all&#275;lous\)</i></b>,<br>
 reciprocal instead of reflexive, pronoun.<br>
 <br>
 12:8 <B>{Killed him and cast him forth}</B> <b><i>(\apekteinan auton, kai<br>
 exebalon auton\)</i></b>. Matthew and Luke reverse the order, cast forth<br>
 and killed.<br>
 <br>
 12:10 <B>{This scripture}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n graph&#275;n taut&#275;n\)</i></b>. This passage of<br>
 scripture <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 4:21; Joh 19:37; Ac 1:16)</i></b>. It is a quotation from<br>
 <!-#-->Ps 118:22f. See on &#175;Mt 21:42 for discussion.<br>
 <br>
 12:11 <B>{This}</B> <b><i>(\haut&#275;\)</i></b>. Feminine in LXX may refer to <B>{kephal&#275;}</B><br>
 <b><i>(head)</i></b> or may be due to the Hebrew original <B>{z&#333;th}</B> <b><i>(this thing)</i></b><br>
 which would be neuter \touto\ in a Greek original, a translation<br>
 Hebraism.<br>
 <br>
 12:12 <B>{Against them}</B> <b><i>(\pros autous\)</i></b>. So Luke. It was a straight<br>
 shot, this parable of the Rejected Stone <b><i>(<!-#-->12:10f.)</i></b> and the<br>
 longer one of the Wicked Husbandmen. There was no mistaking the<br>
 application, for he had specifically explained the application<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 21:43-45)</i></b>. The Sanhedrin were so angry that they actually<br>
 started or sought to seize him, but fear of the populace now more<br>
 enthusiastic for Jesus than ever held them back. They went off in<br>
 disgust, but they had to listen to the Parable of the King's Son<br>
 before going <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 22:1-14)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:13 <B>{That they might catch him in talk}</B> <b><i>(\hina auton agreus&#333;sin<br>
 log&#333;i\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist subjunctive. The verb is late from<br>
 \agra\ <b><i>(a hunt or catching)</i></b>. It appears in the LXX and papyri.<br>
 Here alone in the N.T. <!-#-->Lu 20:20 has the same idea, "that they<br>
 may take hold of his speech" <b><i>(\epilab&#333;ntai autou logon\)</i></b> while<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 22:15 uses \pagideus&#333;sin\ <b><i>(to snare or trap)</i></b>. See discussion<br>
 in Matthew. We have seen the scribes and Pharisees trying to do<br>
 this very thing before <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 11:33f.)</i></b>. Mark and Matthew note here<br>
 the combination of Pharisees and Herodians as Mark did in <!-#-->3:6.<br>
 Matthew speaks of "disciples" or pupils of the Pharisees while<br>
 Luke calls them "spies" <b><i>(\enkathetous\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:14 <B>{Shall we give or shall we not give?}</B> <b><i>(\d&#333;men &#275; m&#275;<br>
 d&#333;men;\)</i></b>. Mark alone repeats the question in this sharp form. The<br>
 deliberative subjunctive, aorist tense active voice. For the<br>
 discussion of the palaver and flattery of this group of<br>
 theological students see on &#175;Mt 22:16-22.<br>
 <br>
 12:15 <B>{Knowing their hypocrisy}</B> <b><i>(\eid&#333;s aut&#333;n t&#275;n hupocrisin\)</i></b>.<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 22:18 has "perceived their wickedness" <b><i>(\gnous t&#275;n pon&#275;rian<br>
 aut&#333;n\)</i></b> while <!-#-->Lu 20:23 says, "perceived their craftiness"<br>
 <b><i>(\katano&#275;sas aut&#333;n t&#275;n panourgian\)</i></b>. Each of these words throws a<br>
 flash-light on the spirit and attitude of these young men. They<br>
 were sly, shrewd, slick, but they did not deceive Jesus with<br>
 their pious palaver. See on Matthew for further details.<br>
 <br>
 12:17 <B>{Marvelled greatly at him}</B> <b><i>(\exethaumazon ep' aut&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect tense with perfective use of the preposition \ex\. Both<br>
 Matthew and Luke use the ingressive aorist. Luke adds that they<br>
 "held their peace" <b><i>(\esig&#275;san\)</i></b> while Matthew notes that they<br>
 "went their way" <b><i>(\ap&#275;lthan\)</i></b>, went off or away.<br>
 <br>
 12:18 <B>{There come unto him Sadducees}</B> <b><i>(\erchontai Saddoukaioi<br>
 pros auton\)</i></b>. Dramatic present. The Pharisees and Herodians had<br>
 had their turn after the formal committee of the Sanhedrin had<br>
 been so completely routed. It was inevitable that they should<br>
 feel called upon to show their intellectual superiority to these<br>
 raw Pharisaic and Herodian theologians. See on &#175;Mt 22:23-33 for<br>
 discussion of details. It was a good time to air their disbelief<br>
 in the resurrection at the expense of the Pharisees and to score<br>
 against Jesus where the Sanhedrin and then the Pharisees and<br>
 Herodians had failed so ignominiously.<br>
 <br>
 12:19 <B>{Moses wrote}</B> <b><i>(\M&#333;us&#275;s egrapsen\)</i></b>. So <!-#-->Lu 20:28 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 38:8;<br>
 De. 25:5f.)</i></b>. Matthew has "said" <b><i>(\eipen\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:20 <B>{Took a wife}</B> <b><i>(\elaben gunaika\)</i></b>. So <!-#-->Lu 20:29. Matthew<br>
 has "married" <b><i>(\g&#275;mas\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:22 <B>{Last of all}</B> <b><i>(\eschaton pant&#333;n\)</i></b>. Adverbial use of<br>
 \eschaton\.<br>
 <br>
 12:23 <B>{To wife}</B> <b><i>(\gunaika\)</i></b>. Predicate accusative in apposition<br>
 with "her" <b><i>(\aut&#275;n\)</i></b>. So Luke, but Matthew merely has "had her"<br>
 <b><i>(\eschon aut&#275;n\)</i></b>, constative aorist indicative active.<br>
 <br>
 12:24 <B>{Is it not for this cause that ye err?}</B> <b><i>(\Ou dia touto<br>
 plan&#257;sthe;\)</i></b>. Mark puts it as a question with \ou\ expecting the<br>
 affirmative answer. Matthew puts it as a positive assertion: "Ye<br>
 are." \Planaomai\ is to wander astray <b><i>(cf. our word _planet_,<br>
 wandering stars, \asteres plan&#275;tai\, <!-#-->Jude 1:13)</i></b> like the Latin<br>
 _errare_ <b><i>(our _error_, err)</i></b>. <B>{That ye know not the scriptures}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275; eidotes tas graphas\)</i></b>. The Sadducees posed as men of<br>
 superior intelligence and knowledge in opposition to the<br>
 traditionalists among the Pharisees with their oral law. And yet<br>
 on this very point they were ignorant of the Scriptures. How much<br>
 error today is due to this same ignorance among the educated!<br>
 <B>{Nor the power of God}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;de t&#275;n dunamin tou theou\)</i></b>. The two<br>
 kinds of ignorance generally go together <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1Co 15:34)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:25 <B>{When they shall rise from the dead}</B> <b><i>(\hotan ek nekr&#333;n<br>
 anast&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Second aorist active subjunctive with \hotan\<br>
 <b><i>(\hote\ plus \an\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 22:30 has it "in the resurrection," <!-#-->Lu<br>
 20:35 "to attain to the resurrection." The Pharisees regarded<br>
 the future resurrection body as performing marriage functions, as<br>
 Mohammedans do today. The Pharisees were in error on this point.<br>
 The Sadducees made this one of their objections to belief in the<br>
 resurrection body, revealing thus their own ignorance of the true<br>
 resurrection body and the future life where marriage functions do<br>
 not exist. <B>{As angels in heaven}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s aggeloi en t&#333;i ouran&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 So <!-#-->Mt 22:30. <!-#-->Lu 20:36 has "equal unto the angels"<br>
 <b><i>(\isaggeloi\)</i></b>. "Their equality with angels consists in their<br>
 deliverance from mortality and its consequences" <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. The<br>
 angels are directly created, not procreated.<br>
 <br>
 12:26 <B>{In the place concerning the Bush}</B> <b><i>(\epi tou batou\)</i></b>. This<br>
 technical use of \epi\ is good Greek, in the matter of, in the<br>
 passage about, the Bush. \Batos\ is masculine here, feminine in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 20:37. The reference is to <!-#-->Ex 3:3-6 <b><i>(in the book of Moses,<br>
 \en t&#275;i bibl&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:27 <B>{Ye do greatly err}</B> <b><i>(\polu plan&#257;sthe\)</i></b>. Only in Mark.<br>
 Solemn, severe, impressive, but kindly close <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:28 <B>{Heard them questioning together}</B> <b><i>(\akousas aut&#333;n<br>
 sunz&#275;tount&#333;n\)</i></b>. The victory of Christ over the Sadducees pleased<br>
 the Pharisees who now had come back with mixed emotions over the<br>
 new turn of things <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 22:34)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu 20:39 represents one of the<br>
 scribes as commending Jesus for his skilful reply to the<br>
 Sadducees. Mark here puts this scribe in a favourable light,<br>
 "knowing that he had answered them well" <b><i>(\eid&#333;s hoti kal&#333;s<br>
 apekrith&#275; autois\)</i></b>. "Them" here means the Sadducees. But <!-#-->Mt<br>
 22:35 says that this lawyer <b><i>(\nomikos\)</i></b> was "tempting"<br>
 <b><i>(\peiraz&#333;n\)</i></b> by his question. "A few, among whom was the scribe,<br>
 were constrained to admire, even if they were willing to<br>
 criticize, the Rabbi who though not himself a Pharisee, surpassed<br>
 the Pharisees as a champion of the truth." That is a just picture<br>
 of this lawyer. <B>{The first of all}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;t&#275; pant&#333;n\)</i></b>. First in<br>
 rank and importance. <!-#-->Mt 22:36 has "great" <b><i>(\megal&#275;\)</i></b>. See<br>
 discussion there. Probably Jesus spoke in Aramaic. "First" and<br>
 "great" in Greek do not differ essentially here. Mark quotes <!-#-->De<br>
 6:4f. as it stands in the LXX and also <!-#-->Le 19:18. <!-#-->Mt 22:40<br>
 adds the summary: "On these two commandments hangeth <b><i>(\krematai\)</i></b><br>
 the whole law and the prophets."<br>
 <br>
 12:32 <B>{And the scribe said}</B> <b><i>(\eipen aut&#333;i ho grammateus\)</i></b>. Mark<br>
 alone gives the reply of the scribe to Jesus which is a mere<br>
 repetition of what Jesus had said about the first and the second<br>
 commandments with the additional allusion to <!-#-->1Sa 15:22 about<br>
 love as superior to whole burnt offerings. <B>{Well}</B> <b><i>(\kal&#333;s\)</i></b>. Not<br>
 to be taken with "saidst" <b><i>(\eipes\)</i></b> as the Revised Version has it<br>
 following Wycliff. Probably \kal&#333;s\ <b><i>(well)</i></b> is exclamatory. "Fine,<br>
 Teacher. Of a truth <b><i>(\ep' al&#275;theias\)</i></b> didst thou say."<br>
 <br>
 12:34 <B>{Discreetly}</B> <b><i>(\nounech&#333;s\)</i></b>. From \nous\ <b><i>(intellect)</i></b> and<br>
 \ech&#333;\, to have. Using the mind to good effect is what the adverb<br>
 means. He had his wits about him, as we say. Here only in the<br>
 N.T. In Aristotle and Polybius. \Nounechont&#333;s\ would be the more<br>
 regular form, adverb from a participle. <B>{Not far}</B> <b><i>(\ou makran\)</i></b>.<br>
 Adverb, not adjective, feminine accusative, a long way <b><i>(\hodon\<br>
 understood)</i></b>. The critical attitude of the lawyer had melted<br>
 before the reply of Jesus into genuine enthusiasm that showed him<br>
 to be near the kingdom of God. <B>{No man after that}</B> <b><i>(\oudeis<br>
 ouketi\)</i></b>. Double negative. The debate was closed <b><i>(\etolma\,<br>
 imperfect tense, dared)</i></b>. Jesus was complete victor on every side.<br>
 <br>
 12:35 <B>{How say the scribes}</B> <b><i>(\P&#333;s legousin hoi grammateis\)</i></b>. The<br>
 opponents of Jesus are silenced, but he answers them and goes on<br>
 teaching <b><i>(\didask&#333;n\)</i></b> in the temple as before the attacks began<br>
 that morning <b><i>(<!-#-->11:27)</i></b>. They no longer dare to question Jesus,<br>
 but he has one to put to them "while the Pharisees were gathered<br>
 together" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 22:41)</i></b>. The question is not a conundrum or<br>
 scriptural puzzle <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>, but "He contents himself with pointing<br>
 out a difficulty, in the solution of which lay the key to the<br>
 whole problem of His person and work" <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. The scribes all<br>
 taught that the Messiah was to be the son of David <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 7:41)</i></b>.<br>
 The people in the Triumphal Entry had acclaimed Jesus as the son<br>
 of David <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 21:9)</i></b>. But the rabbis had overlooked the fact that<br>
 David in <!-#-->Ps 110:1 called the Messiah his Lord also. The deity<br>
 and the humanity of the Messiah are both involved in the problem.<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 22:45 observes that "no one was able to answer him a word."<br>
 <br>
 12:36 <B>{The footstool}</B> <b><i>(\hupopodion\)</i></b>. Westcott and Hort read<br>
 \hupokat&#333;\ <b><i>(under)</i></b> after Aleph B D L.<br>
 <br>
 12:37 <B>{The common people heard him gladly}</B> <b><i>(\ho polus ochlos<br>
 &#275;kouen autou hede&#333;s\)</i></b>. Literally, the much multitude <b><i>(the huge<br>
 crowd)</i></b> was listening <b><i>(imperfect tense)</i></b> to him gladly. Mark alone<br>
 has this item. The Sanhedrin had begun the formal attack that<br>
 morning to destroy the influence of Jesus with the crowds whose<br>
 hero he now was since the Triumphal Entry. It had been a colossal<br>
 failure. The crowds were drawn closer to him than before.<br>
 <br>
 12:38 <B>{Beware of the scribes}</B> <b><i>(\blepete apo t&#333;n grammate&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Jesus now turns to the multitudes and to his disciples <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 23:1)</i></b> and warns them against the scribes and the Pharisees while<br>
 they are still there to hear his denunciation. The scribes were<br>
 the professional teachers of the current Judaism and were nearly<br>
 all Pharisees. Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:38-40)</i></b> gives a mere summary sketch<br>
 of this bold and terrific indictment as preserved in <!-#-->Mt 23 in<br>
 words that fairly blister today. <!-#-->Lu 20:45-47 follows Mark<br>
 closely. See <!-#-->Mt 8:15 for this same use of \blepete apo\ with<br>
 the ablative. It is usually called a translation-Hebraism, a<br>
 usage not found with \blep&#333;\ in the older Greek. But the papyri<br>
 give it, a vivid vernacular idiom. "Beware of the Jews" <b><i>(\blepe<br>
 saton apo t&#333;n Ioudai&#333;n\, Berl. G. U. 1079. A.D. 41)</i></b>. See<br>
 Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 577. The pride of the pompous scribes is<br>
 itemized by Mark: <B>{To walk in long robes}</B> <b><i>(\stolais\)</i></b>, <B>{stoles}</B>,<br>
 the dress of dignitaries like kings and priests. <B>{Salutations in<br>
 the marketplaces}</B> <b><i>(\aspasmous en tais agorais\)</i></b>, where the people<br>
 could see their dignity recognized.<br>
 <br>
 12:39 <B>{First seats in the synagogues}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;tokathedrias\)</i></b>. As a<br>
 mark of special piety, seats up in front while now the hypocrites<br>
 present in church prefer the rear seats. <B>{Chief places at feasts}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pr&#333;toklisias en tois deipnois\)</i></b>. Recognizing proper rank and<br>
 station. Even the disciples fall victims to this desire for<br>
 precedence at table <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:24)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:40 <B>{Devour widows' houses}</B> <b><i>(\hoi katesthontes t&#257;s oikias t&#333;n<br>
 ch&#275;r&#333;n\)</i></b>. New sentence in the nominative. Terrible pictures of<br>
 civil wrong by graft grabbing the homes of helpless widows. They<br>
 inveigled widows into giving their homes to the temple and took<br>
 it for themselves. <B>{For a pretence make long prayers}</B> <b><i>(\prophasei<br>
 makra proseuchomenoi\)</i></b>. \Prophasei\ instrumental case of the same<br>
 word <b><i>(\proph&#275;mi\)</i></b> from which prophet comes, but here pretext,<br>
 pretence of extra piety while robbing the widows and pushing<br>
 themselves to the fore. Some derive it from \prophain&#333;\, to show<br>
 forth. <B>{Greater}</B> <b><i>(\perissoteron\)</i></b>. More abundant condemnation.<br>
 Some comfort in that at any rate.<br>
 <br>
 12:41 <B>{Sat down over against the treasury}</B> <b><i>(\kathisas katenanti<br>
 tou gazophulakiou\)</i></b>. The storm is over. The Pharisees, Sadducees,<br>
 Herodians, scribes, have all slunk away in terror ere the closing<br>
 words. Mark draws this immortal picture of the weary Christ<br>
 sitting by the treasury <b><i>(compound word in the LXX from \gaza\,<br>
 Persian word for treasure, and \phulak&#275;\, guard, so safe for<br>
 gifts to be deposited)</i></b>. <B>{Beheld}</B> <b><i>(\ethe&#333;rei\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense.<br>
 He was watching <B>{how the multitude cast money}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;s ho ochlos<br>
 ballei\)</i></b> into the treasury. The rich were casting in <b><i>(\eballon\,<br>
 imperfect tense)</i></b> as he watched.<br>
 <br>
 12:42 <B>{One poor widow}</B> <b><i>(\mia ch&#275;ra pt&#333;ch&#275;\)</i></b>. Luke has \penichra\,<br>
 a poetical late form of \pen&#275;s\. In the N.T. the \pt&#333;chos\ is the<br>
 pauper rather than the mere peasant, the extreme opposite of the<br>
 rich <b><i>(\plousioi\)</i></b>. The money given by most was copper<br>
 <b><i>(\chalkon\)</i></b>. <B>{Two mites}</B> <b><i>(\duo lepta\)</i></b>. \Leptos\ means peeled or<br>
 stripped and so very thin. Two \lepta\ were about two-fifths of a<br>
 cent. <B>{Farthing}</B> <b><i>(\kodrantes\, Latin _quadrans_, a quarter of an<br>
 _as_)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:43 <B>{Called unto him}</B> <b><i>(\proskalesamenos\)</i></b>. Indirect middle<br>
 voice. The disciples themselves had slipped away from him while<br>
 the terrific denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees had gone<br>
 on, puzzled at this turn of affairs. <B>{More than all}</B> <b><i>(\pleion<br>
 pant&#333;n\)</i></b>. Ablative of comparison <b><i>(\pant&#333;n\)</i></b>. It may mean, more<br>
 than all the rich put together. <B>{All that she had}</B> <b><i>(\panta hosa<br>
 eichen\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense. <B>{Cast in}</B> <b><i>(\ebalen\)</i></b>. Aorist tense, in<br>
 sharp contrast. <B>{All her living}</B> <b><i>(\holon ton bion aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Her<br>
 <B>{livelihood}</B> <b><i>(\bios\)</i></b>, not her life <b><i>(\z&#333;&#275;\)</i></b>. It is a tragedy to<br>
 see a stingy saint pose as giving the widow's mite when he could<br>
 give thousands instead of pennies.<br>
