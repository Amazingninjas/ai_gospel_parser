<p>15:1 <B>{I make known}</B> <b><i>(\gn&#333;riz&#333;\)</i></b>. See on &#175;12:3 for this common<br>
 verb. As if in reproach. <B>{The gospel which I preached unto you}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\to euaggelion ho eu&#275;ggelisam&#275;n humin\)</i></b>. Cognate accusative,<br>
 "the gospel which I gospelized unto you." Note augment \&#275;\ after<br>
 \eu-\ like compound verb with preposition. Note repetition of<br>
 relative <b><i>(\ho, en h&#333;i, di hou\, and \tini\ like relative)</i></b> without<br>
 \kai\ <b><i>(and)</i></b>, asyndeton.<br>
 <br>
 15:2 <B>{In what words I preached it unto you}</B> <b><i>(\tini logoi<br>
 eu&#275;ggelisam&#275;n humin\)</i></b>. Almost certainly \tis\ <b><i>(\tini logoi\,<br>
 locative or instrumental, in or with)</i></b> here is used like the<br>
 relative \hos\ as is common in papyri <b><i>(Moulton, _Prolegomena_, p.<br>
 93f.; Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 737f.)</i></b>. Even so it is not clear<br>
 whether the clause depends on \gn&#333;riz&#333;\ like the other relatives,<br>
 but most likely so. <B>{If we hold it fast}</B> <b><i>(\ei katechete\)</i></b>.<br>
 Condition of first class. Paul assumes that they are holding it<br>
 fast. <B>{Except ye believed in vain}</B> <b><i>(\ektos ei m&#275; eik&#275;i<br>
 episteusate\)</i></b>. For \ektos ei m&#275;\ see on &#175;14:5. Condition of<br>
 first class, unless in fact ye did believe to no purpose<br>
 <b><i>(\eik&#275;i\, old adverb, only in Paul in N.T.)</i></b>. Paul holds this<br>
 peril over them in their temptation to deny the resurrection.<br>
 <br>
 15:3 <B>{First of all}</B> <b><i>(\en pr&#333;tois\)</i></b>. Among first things. _In<br>
 primis_. Not to time, but to importance. <B>{Which I also received}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ho kai parelabon\)</i></b>. Direct revelation claimed as about the<br>
 institution of the Lord's Supper <b><i>(<!-#-->11:23)</i></b> and same verbs used<br>
 <b><i>(\pared&#333;ka, parelabon\)</i></b>. Four items given by Paul in explaining<br>
 "the gospel" which Paul preached. Stanley calls it <b><i>(verses<br>
 <!-#-->1-11)</i></b> the creed of the early disciples, but "rather a sample of<br>
 the exact form of the apostle's early teaching, than a profession<br>
 of faith on the part of converts" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. The four items are<br>
 presented by four verbs <b><i>(died, \apethanen\, was buried, \etaph&#275;\,<br>
 hath been raised, \eg&#275;gertai\, appeared, \&#333;phth&#275;\)</i></b>. <B>{Christ died}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Christos apethanen\)</i></b>. Historical fact and crucial event. <B>{For<br>
 our sins}</B> <b><i>(\huper t&#333;n hamarti&#333;n h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. \Huper\ means literally<br>
 over, in behalf, even instead of <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 3:13)</i></b>, where used of<br>
 persons. But here much in the sense of \peri\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 1:14)</i></b> as is<br>
 common in _Koin&#275;_. In <!-#-->1Pe 3:18 we have \peri hamarti&#333;n, huper<br>
 adik&#333;n\. <B>{According to the Scriptures}</B> <b><i>(\kata tas graphas\)</i></b>. As<br>
 Jesus showed <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:37; 24:25)</i></b> and as Peter pointed out <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 2:25-27; 3:35)</i></b> and as Paul had done <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 13:24f.; 17:3)</i></b>. Cf.<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 1:2ff.<br>
 <br>
 15:4 <B>{And that he was buried}</B> <b><i>(\kai hoti etaph&#275;\)</i></b>. Note \hoti\<br>
 repeated before each of the four verbs as a separate item. Second<br>
 aorist passive indicative of \thapt&#333;\, old verb, to bury. This<br>
 item is an important detail as the Gospels show. <B>{And that he<br>
 hath been raised}</B> <b><i>(\kai hoti eg&#275;gertai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 indicative, not \&#275;gerth&#275;\ like <B>{rose}</B> of the King James' Version.<br>
 There is reason for this sudden change of tense. Paul wishes to<br>
 emphasize the permanence of the resurrection of Jesus. He is<br>
 still risen. <B>{On the third day}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i h&#275;mer&#257;i t&#275;i trit&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Locative case of time. Whether Paul had seen either of the<br>
 Gospels we do not know, but this item is closely identified with<br>
 the fact of Christ's resurrection. We have it in Peter's speech<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10:40)</i></b> and Jesus points it out as part of prophecy <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 24:46)</i></b>. The other expression occasionally found "after three<br>
 days" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 10:34)</i></b> is merely free vernacular for the same idea<br>
 and not even <!-#-->Mt 12:40 disturbs it. See on &#175;Lu 24:1 for record<br>
 of the empty tomb on the first day of the week <b><i>(the third day)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:5 <B>{And that he appeared to Cephas}</B> <b><i>(\kai hoti &#333;phth&#275; K&#275;ph&#257;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive indicative of the defective verb \hora&#333;\, to<br>
 see. Paul means not a mere "vision," but actual appearance. John<br>
 uses \ephaner&#333;th&#275;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 21:14)</i></b> from \phanero&#333;\, to make<br>
 manifest, of Christ's appearance to the seven by the Sea of<br>
 Galilee. Peter was listed first <b><i>(\pr&#333;tos\)</i></b> among the Apostles<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:2)</i></b>. Jesus had sent a special message to him <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 16:7)</i></b><br>
 after his resurrection. This special appearance to Peter is made<br>
 the determining factor in the joyful faith of the disciples <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 24:34)</i></b>, though mentioned incidentally here. Paul had told all<br>
 these four facts to the Corinthians in his preaching. He gives<br>
 further proof of the fact of Christ's resurrection. There are ten<br>
 appearances given besides the one to Paul. Nine are in the<br>
 Gospels <b><i>(Mary Magdalene in John and Mark, the other women in<br>
 Matthew, the two going to Emmaus in Luke, Simon Peter in Luke and<br>
 I Corinthians, the ten apostles and others in Luke and John and<br>
 Mark, the eleven and others in John, the seven by the sea in<br>
 John, to over five hundred in Galilee in Matthew and Paul and<br>
 Mark, to the apostles in Jerusalem in Luke and Mark and Acts and<br>
 I Corinthians)</i></b> and one in I Corinthians above <b><i>(to James)</i></b>. It will<br>
 be seen that Paul mentions only five of the ten, one, that to<br>
 James, not given elsewhere. What he gives is conclusive evidence<br>
 of the fact, particularly when re-enforced by his own experience<br>
 <b><i>(the sixth appearance mentioned by Paul)</i></b>. The way to prove this<br>
 great fact is to start with Paul's own witness given in this<br>
 undoubted Epistle. The natural way to understand Paul's adverbs<br>
 of time here is chronological: <B>{then}</B> <b><i>(\eita\)</i></b>, <B>{then}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epeita\)</i></b>, <B>{then}</B> <b><i>(\epeita\)</i></b>, <B>{then}</B> <b><i>(\eita\)</i></b>, <B>{last of all}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eschaton pant&#333;n\)</i></b>. <B>{To the twelve}</B> <b><i>(\tois d&#333;deka\)</i></b>. The<br>
 technical name. Only ten were present, for Judas was dead and<br>
 Thomas was absent <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 20:24)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:6 <B>{To above five hundred brethren at once}</B> <b><i>(\epan&#333;<br>
 pentakosiois adelphois ephapax\)</i></b>. \Epan&#333;\ here is just an adverb<br>
 with no effect on the case. As a preposition with the ablative<br>
 see <!-#-->Mt 5:14. This incident is the one described in <!-#-->Mt 28:16<br>
 the prearranged meeting on the mountain in Galilee. The strength<br>
 of this witness lies in the fact that the majority <b><i>(\hoi<br>
 pleious\)</i></b> of them were still living when Paul wrote this Epistle,<br>
 say spring of A.D. 54 or 55, not over 25 years after Christ's<br>
 resurrection.<br>
 <br>
 15:7 <B>{To James}</B> <b><i>(\Iak&#333;b&#333;i\)</i></b>. The brother of the Lord. This fact<br>
 explains the presence of the brothers of Jesus in the upper room<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 1:14)</i></b>. <B>{To all the apostles}</B> <b><i>(\tois apostolois pasin\)</i></b>. The<br>
 Ascension of Christ from Olivet.<br>
 <br>
 15:8 <B>{As unto one born out of due time}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;sperei t&#333;i<br>
 ektr&#333;mati\)</i></b>. Literally, as to the miscarriage <b><i>(or untimely<br>
 birth)</i></b>. Word first occurs in Aristotle for abortion or<br>
 miscarriage and occurs in LXX <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 12:12; Job 3:16)</i></b> and papyri<br>
 <b><i>(for miscarriage by accident)</i></b>. The verb \titr&#333;sk&#333;\ means to wound<br>
 and \ek\ is out. Paul means that the appearance to him came after<br>
 Jesus had ascended to heaven.<br>
 <br>
 15:9 <B>{The least}</B> <b><i>(\ho elachistos\)</i></b>. True superlative, not<br>
 elative. Explanation of the strong word \ektr&#333;ma\ just used. See<br>
 <!-#-->Eph 3:8 where he calls himself "less than the least of all<br>
 saints" and <!-#-->1Ti 1:15 the "chief" <b><i>(\pr&#333;tos\)</i></b> of sinners. Yet<br>
 under attack from the Judaizers Paul stood up for his rank as<br>
 equal to any apostle <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:5f.,23)</i></b>. <B>{Because I persecuted the<br>
 church of God}</B> <b><i>(\edi&#333;xa t&#275;n ekkl&#275;sian tou theou\)</i></b>. There were<br>
 times when this terrible fact confronted Paul like a nightmare.<br>
 Who does not understand this mood of contrition?<br>
 <br>
 15:10 <B>{What I am}</B> <b><i>(\ho eimi\)</i></b>. Not, <B>{who}</B> <b><i>(\hos\)</i></b>, but <B>{what}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ho\)</i></b>, neuter singular. His actual character and attainments.<br>
 All "by the grace of God" <b><i>(\chariti theou\)</i></b>. <B>{I laboured more<br>
 abundantly than they all}</B> <b><i>(\perissoteron aut&#333;n pant&#333;n ekopiasa\)</i></b>.<br>
 This is sober fact as shown by the Acts and Paul's Epistles. He<br>
 had tremendous energy and used it. Genius is work, Carlyle said.<br>
 Take Paul as a specimen.<br>
 <br>
 15:11 <B>{So we preach, and so ye believed}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s k&#275;russomen, kai<br>
 hout&#333;s episteusate\)</i></b>. This is what matters both for preacher and<br>
 hearers. This is Paul's gospel. Their conduct in response to his<br>
 message was on record.<br>
 <br>
 15:12 <B>{Is preached}</B> <b><i>(\k&#275;russetai\)</i></b>. Personal use of the verb,<br>
 Christ is preached. <B>{How say some among you?}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;s legousin en<br>
 humin tines?\)</i></b>. The question springs naturally from the proof of<br>
 the fact of the resurrection of Christ <b><i>(verses <!-#-->1-11)</i></b> and the<br>
 continual preaching which Paul here assumes by condition of the<br>
 first class <b><i>(\ei--k&#275;russetai\)</i></b>. There were sceptics in Corinth,<br>
 possibly in the church, who denied the resurrection of dead<br>
 people just as some men today deny that miracles happen or ever<br>
 did happen. Paul's answer is the resurrection of Christ as a<br>
 fact. It all turns on this fact.<br>
 <br>
 15:13 <B>{Neither hath Christ been raised}</B> <b><i>(\oude Christos<br>
 eg&#275;gertai\)</i></b>. He turns the argument round with tremendous force.<br>
 But it is fair.<br>
 <br>
 15:14 <B>{Vain}</B> <b><i>(\kenon\)</i></b>. _Inanis_, Vulgate. Old word, empty. Both<br>
 Paul's preaching and their faith are empty if Christ has not been<br>
 raised. If the sceptics refuse to believe the fact of Christ's<br>
 resurrection, they have nothing to stand on.<br>
 <br>
 15:15 <B>{False witnesses of God}</B> <b><i>(\pseudomartures tou theou\)</i></b>. Late<br>
 word, but \pseudomarture&#333;\, to bear false witness, old and<br>
 common. The genitive <b><i>(\tou theou\)</i></b> can be either subjective <b><i>(in<br>
 God's service)</i></b> or objective <b><i>(concerning God)</i></b>. Either makes good<br>
 sense. <B>{Because we witnessed of God}</B> <b><i>(\hoti emartur&#275;samen kata<br>
 tou theou\)</i></b>. Vulgate has _adversus Deum_. This is the more<br>
 natural way to take \kata\ and genitive, <B>{against God}</B> not as<br>
 equal to \peri\ <b><i>(concerning)</i></b>. He would indeed make God play false<br>
 in that case, <B>{if so be that the dead are not raised}</B> <b><i>(\eiper ara<br>
 nekroi ouk egeirontai\)</i></b>. Condition of first class, assumed as<br>
 true. Note both \per\ intensive particle <B>{indeed}</B> and \ara\<br>
 inferential particle <B>{therefore}</B>.<br>
 <br>
 15:16 Repeats the position already taken in verse <!-#-->13.<br>
 <br>
 15:17 <B>{Vain}</B> <b><i>(\mataia\)</i></b>. Old word from adverb \mat&#275;n\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 15:9)</i></b>, devoid of truth, a lie. Stronger word than \kenon\ in<br>
 verse <!-#-->14. <B>{Ye are yet in your sins}</B> <b><i>(\eti este en tais<br>
 hamartiais hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Because the death of Christ has no atoning<br>
 value if he did not rise from the dead. In that case he was only<br>
 a man like other men and did not die for our sins <b><i>(verse <!-#-->3)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:18 <B>{Then also}</B> <b><i>(\ara kai\)</i></b>. Inevitable inference. <B>{Have<br>
 perished}</B> <b><i>(\ap&#333;lonto\)</i></b>. Did perish. Second aorist middle<br>
 indicative of \apollumi\, to destroy, middle, to perish<br>
 <b><i>(delivered up to eternal misery)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->8:11.<br>
 <br>
 15:19 <B>{We have hoped}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;lpikotes esmen\)</i></b>. Periphrastic perfect<br>
 active indicative. Hope limited to this life even if "in Christ."<br>
 <B>{Only}</B> <b><i>(\monon\)</i></b> qualifies the whole clause. <B>{Most pitiable}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eleeinoteroi\)</i></b>. Comparative form, not superlative, of old<br>
 adjective \eleeinos\, to be pitied, pitiable. If our hope is<br>
 limited to this life, we have denied ourselves what people call<br>
 pleasures and have no happiness beyond. The Epicureans have the<br>
 argument on us. Paul makes morality turn on the hope of<br>
 immortality. Is he not right? Witness the breaking of moral ties<br>
 today when people take a merely animal view of life.<br>
 <br>
 15:20 <B>{But now}</B> <b><i>(\nuni de\)</i></b>. Emphatic form of \nun\ with \-i\<br>
 added <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->12:18)</i></b>. It is the logical triumph of Paul after the<br>
 _reductio ad impossibile_ <b><i>(Findlay)</i></b> of the preceding argument.<br>
 <B>{The first-fruits}</B> <b><i>(\aparch&#275;\)</i></b>. Old word from \aparchomai\, to<br>
 offer firstlings or first-fruits. In LXX for first-fruits. In<br>
 papyri for legacy-duty, entrance-fee, and also first-fruits as<br>
 here. See also verse <!-#-->23; 16:15; Ro 8:23, etc. Christ is<br>
 "first-born from the dead" <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 1:18)</i></b>. Others raised from the<br>
 dead died again, but not so Jesus. <B>{That sleep}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n<br>
 kekoim&#275;men&#333;n\)</i></b>. Perfect middle participle as in <!-#-->Mt 27:52 which<br>
 see. Beautiful picture of death from which word <b><i>(\koimaomai\)</i></b><br>
 comes our \cemetery\.<br>
 <br>
 15:21 <B>{By man also}</B> <b><i>(\dai di' anthr&#333;pou\)</i></b>. That is Jesus, the<br>
 God-man, the Second Adam <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 5:12)</i></b>. The hope of the<br>
 resurrection of the dead rests in Christ.<br>
 <br>
 15:22 <B>{Shall be made alive}</B> <b><i>(\z&#333;opoi&#275;th&#275;sontai\)</i></b>. First future<br>
 passive indicative of \z&#333;opoie&#333;\, late verb <b><i>(Aristotle)</i></b> to give<br>
 life, to restore to life as here. In verse <!-#-->36 \z&#333;opoieitai\ is<br>
 used in the sense of natural life as in <!-#-->Joh 5:21; 6:63 of<br>
 spiritual life. It is not easy to catch Paul's thought here. He<br>
 means resurrection <b><i>(restoration)</i></b> by the verb here, but not<br>
 necessarily eternal life or salvation. So also \pantes\ may not<br>
 coincide in both clauses. All who die die in Adam, all who will<br>
 be made alive will be made alive <b><i>(restored to life)</i></b> in Christ.<br>
 The same problem occurs in <!-#-->Ro 5:18 about "all," and in verse<br>
 <!-#-->19 about "the many."<br>
 <br>
 15:23 <B>{Order}</B> <b><i>(\tagmati\)</i></b>. Old military term from \tass&#333;\, to<br>
 arrange, here only in N.T. Each in his own division, troop, rank.<br>
 <B>{At his coming}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i parousi&#257;i\)</i></b>. The word \parousia\ was the<br>
 technical word "for the arrival or visit of the king or emperor"<br>
 and can be traced from the Ptolemaic period into the second<br>
 century A.D. <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient East_, p. 368)</i></b>.<br>
 "Advent-coins were struck after a parousia of the emperor." Paul<br>
 is only discussing "those that are Christ's" <b><i>(<!-#-->3:23; Ga 5:24)</i></b><br>
 and so says nothing about judgment <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1Th 2:19; 3:13; 4:15;<br>
 5:23)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:24 <B>{Then cometh the end}</B> <b><i>(\eita to telos\)</i></b>. No verb \ginetai\<br>
 in the Greek. Supply "at his coming," the end or consummation of<br>
 the age or world <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 13:39,49; 1Pe 4:7)</i></b>, <B>{When he shall deliver<br>
 up}</B> <b><i>(\hotan paradid&#333;i\)</i></b>. Present active subjunctive <b><i>(not<br>
 optative)</i></b> of \paradid&#333;mi\ with \hotan\, whenever, and so quite<br>
 indefinite and uncertain as to time. Present subjunctive rather<br>
 than aorist \parad&#333;i\ because it pictures a future proceeding.<br>
 <B>{To God, even the Father}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i the&#333;i kai patri\)</i></b>. Better, "to<br>
 the God and Father" or to "His God and Father." The Kingdom<br>
 belongs to the Father. <B>{When he shall have abolished}</B> <b><i>(\hotan<br>
 katarg&#275;s&#275;i\)</i></b>. First aorist active subjunctive with \hotan\,<br>
 indefinite future time. Simply, "whenever he shall abolish," no<br>
 use in making it future perfect, merely aorist subjunctive. On<br>
 \katarge&#333;\ see <!-#-->1Co 6:13; 13:8,10,11. <B>{Rule}</B> <b><i>(\arch&#275;n\)</i></b>,<br>
 <B>{authority}</B> <b><i>(\exousian\)</i></b>, <B>{power}</B> <b><i>(\dunamin\)</i></b>. All forms of power<br>
 opposing the will of God. Constative aorist tense covering the<br>
 whole period of conflict with final victory as climax.<br>
 <br>
 15:25 <B>{Till he hath put}</B> <b><i>(\achri hou th&#275;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 subjunctive of \tith&#275;mi\, "till he put" <b><i>(no sense in saying "hath<br>
 put," merely effective aorist tense for climax. \Achri <b><i>(hou)</i></b>,<br>
 mechri <b><i>(hou)</i></b>, he&#333;s <b><i>(hou)</i></b>\ all are used for the same idea of<br>
 indefinite future time.)</i></b><br>
 <br>
 15:26 <B>{The last enemy that shall be abolished is death}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eschatos echthros katargeitai ho thanatos\)</i></b>. A rather free<br>
 translation. Literally, "death <b><i>(note article, and so subject)</i></b> is<br>
 done away <b><i>(prophetic or futuristic use of present tense of same<br>
 verb as in verse <!-#-->24)</i></b>, the last enemy" <b><i>(predicate and only one<br>
 "last" and so no article as in <!-#-->1Jo 2:18)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:27 <B>{He put}</B> <b><i>(\hupetaxen\)</i></b>. First aorist active of \hupotass&#333;\,<br>
 to subject. Supply God <b><i>(\theos\)</i></b> as subject <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps 8:7)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Heb<br>
 2:5-9 for similar use. Cf. <!-#-->Ps 8. <B>{But when he saith}</B> <b><i>(\hotan<br>
 de eip&#275;i\)</i></b>. Here Christ must be supplied as the subject if the<br>
 reference is to his future and final triumph. The syntax more<br>
 naturally calls for God as the subject as before. Either way<br>
 makes sense. But there is no need to take \eip&#275;i\ <b><i>(second aorist<br>
 active subjunctive)</i></b> as _a futurum exactum_, merely "whenever he<br>
 shall say." <B>{Are put in subjection}</B> <b><i>(\hupotetaktai\)</i></b>. Perfect<br>
 passive indicative, state of completion, final triumph. <B>{It is<br>
 evident that}</B> <b><i>(\d&#275;lon hoti\)</i></b>. Supply \estin\ <b><i>(is)</i></b> before \hoti\.<br>
 <B>{He is excepted who did subject}</B> <b><i>(\ektos tou hupotaxantos\)</i></b>.<br>
 "Except the one <b><i>(God)</i></b> who did subject <b><i>(articular aorist active<br>
 participle)</i></b> the all things to him <b><i>(Christ)</i></b>."<br>
 <br>
 15:28 <B>{And when all things have been subjected}</B> <b><i>(\hotan de<br>
 hupotag&#275;i ta panta\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive subjunctive of<br>
 \hupotass&#333;\, not perfect. Merely, "when the all things are<br>
 subjected unto him." The aorist subjunctive has given translators<br>
 a deal of needless trouble in this passage. It is prophecy, of<br>
 course. <B>{That God may be all in all}</B> <b><i>(\hina &#275;i ho theos panta en<br>
 pasin\)</i></b>. The final goal of all God's redemptive plans as Paul has<br>
 so well said in <!-#-->Ro 11:36. Precisely this language Paul will use<br>
 of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 3:11)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:29 <B>{Else}</B> <b><i>(\epei\)</i></b>. Otherwise, if not true. On this use of<br>
 \epei\ with ellipsis see on &#175;5:10; 7:14. <B>{Which are baptized for<br>
 the dead}</B> <b><i>(\hoi baptizomenoi huper t&#333;n nekr&#333;n\)</i></b>. This passage<br>
 remains a puzzle. Stanley gives thirteen interpretations, no one<br>
 of which may be correct. Over thirty have been suggested. The<br>
 Greek expositors took it to be about the dead <b><i>(\huper\ in sense<br>
 of \peri\ as often as in <!-#-->2Co 1:6)</i></b> since baptism is a burial and<br>
 a resurrection <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 6:2-6)</i></b>. Tertullian tells of some heretics<br>
 who took it to mean baptized in the place of dead people<br>
 <b><i>(unsaved)</i></b> in order to save them. Some take it to be baptism over<br>
 the dead. Others take it to mean that Paul and others were in<br>
 peril of death as shown by baptism <b><i>(see verse <!-#-->30)</i></b>. <B>{At all}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hol&#333;s\)</i></b>. See on &#175;5:1.<br>
 <br>
 15:30 <B>{Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?}</B> <b><i>(\ti kai<br>
 h&#275;meis kinduneuomen pasan h&#333;ran?\)</i></b>. We also as well as those who<br>
 receive baptism which symbolizes death. Old verb from \kindunos\<br>
 <b><i>(peril, danger)</i></b>, in N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 8:23. Paul's Epistles<br>
 and Acts <b><i>(especially chapter <!-#-->Ac 19)</i></b> throw light on Paul's<br>
 argument. He was never out of danger from Damascus to the last<br>
 visit to Rome. There are perils in Ephesus of which we do not<br>
 know <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 1:8f.)</i></b> whatever may be true as to an Ephesian<br>
 imprisonment. G. S. Duncan <b><i>(_St. Paul's Ephesian Ministry_, 1930)</i></b><br>
 even argues for several imprisonments in Ephesus. The accusative<br>
 of time <b><i>(\pasan h&#333;ran\)</i></b> naturally means all through every hour<br>
 <b><i>(extension)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:31 <B>{I protest by that glorying in you}</B> <b><i>(\n&#275; t&#275;n humeteran<br>
 kauch&#275;sin\)</i></b>. No word for "I protest." Paul takes solemn oath by<br>
 the use of \n&#275;\ <b><i>(common in Attic)</i></b> with the accusative. Only here<br>
 in N.T., but in LXX <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 42:15f.)</i></b>. For other solemn oaths by<br>
 Paul see <!-#-->2Co 1:18,23; 11:10f.,31; Ro 9:1. For \kauch&#275;sis\ see<br>
 on &#175;1Th 2:19. The possessive pronoun <b><i>(\humeteran\)</i></b> is objective<br>
 as \em&#275;n\ in <!-#-->1Co 11:24. <B>{I die daily}</B> <b><i>(\kath' h&#275;meran<br>
 apothn&#275;sk&#333;\)</i></b>. I am in daily peril of death <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 4:11; 11:23; Ro<br>
 8:36)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:32 <B>{After the manner of men}</B> <b><i>(\kata anthr&#333;pon\)</i></b>. Like men, for<br>
 applause, money, etc. <b><i>(<!-#-->4:9ff.; Php 3:7)</i></b>. <B>{If I fought with wild<br>
 beasts at Ephesus}</B> <b><i>(\ei eth&#275;riomach&#275;sa en Ephes&#333;i\)</i></b>. Late verb<br>
 from \th&#275;riomachos\, a fighter with wild beasts. Found in<br>
 inscriptions and in Ignatius. Those who argue for an Ephesian<br>
 imprisonment for Paul and Ephesus as the place where he wrote the<br>
 imprisonment epistles <b><i>(see Duncan's book just mentioned)</i></b> take the<br>
 verb literally. There is in the ruins of Ephesus now a place<br>
 called St. Paul's Prison. But Paul was a Roman citizen and it was<br>
 unlawful to make such a one be a \th&#275;riomachos\. If he were cast<br>
 to the lions unlawfully, he could have prevented it by claiming<br>
 his citizenship. Besides, shortly after this Paul wrote II<br>
 Corinthians, but he does not mention so unusual a peril in the<br>
 list in <!-#-->2Co 11:23f. The incident, whatever it was, whether<br>
 literal or figurative language, took place before Paul wrote I<br>
 Corinthians. <B>{What doth it profit me?}</B> <b><i>(\ti moi to ophelos?\)</i></b>.<br>
 What the profit to me? <B>{Let us eat and drink}</B> <b><i>(\phag&#333;men kai<br>
 pi&#333;men\)</i></b>. Volitive second aorist subjunctives of \esthi&#333;\ and<br>
 \pin&#333;\. Cited from <!-#-->Isa 22:13. It is the outcry of the people of<br>
 Jerusalem during the siege of Jerusalem by the Assyrians. At<br>
 Anchiale near Tarsus is a statue of Sardanapalus with the<br>
 inscription: "Eat, drink, enjoy thyself. The rest is nothing."<br>
 This was the motto of the Epicureans. Paul is not giving his own<br>
 view, but that of people who deny the resurrection.<br>
 <br>
 15:33 <B>{Be not deceived}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; plan&#257;sthe\)</i></b>. Do not be led astray<br>
 <b><i>(\plana&#333;\)</i></b> by such a false philosophy of life. <B>{Evil company}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\homiliai kakai\)</i></b>. Evil companionships. Old word, \homilia\,<br>
 from \homilos\ <b><i>(a crowd, gang, bunch)</i></b>. Only here in N.T. Good<br>
 manners <b><i>(\&#275;th&#275;\)</i></b>. Old word <b><i>(kin to \ethos\)</i></b> custom, usage,<br>
 morals. Good morals here. This line of poetry <b><i>(iambic)</i></b> occurs in<br>
 Menander. It may be a current proverb. Paul could have gotten it<br>
 from either source.<br>
 <br>
 15:34 <B>{Awake up righteously}</B> <b><i>(\ekn&#275;psate dikai&#333;s\)</i></b>. Wake up as if<br>
 from drunkenness. \Ekn&#275;ph&#333;\, only here in N.T. sin not <b><i>(\m&#275;<br>
 hamartanete\)</i></b>. Stop sinning. <B>{No knowledge of God}</B> <b><i>(\agn&#333;sian<br>
 theou\)</i></b>. Old word for ignorance, in N.T. only here and <!-#-->1Pe<br>
 2:15. Ignorance of God, agnosticism. Some today <b><i>(agnostics)</i></b> even<br>
 take pride in it instead of shame <b><i>(\entrop&#275;n\, turning in on<br>
 oneself)</i></b>. See on &#175;6:5 for \entrop&#275;\.<br>
 <br>
 15:35 <B>{But some one will say}</B> <b><i>(\alla erei tis\)</i></b>. Paul knows what<br>
 the sceptics were saying. He is a master at putting the<br>
 standpoint of the imaginary adversary. <B>{How}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;s\)</i></b>. This is<br>
 still the great objection to the resurrection of our bodies.<br>
 Granted that Jesus rose from the dead, for the sake of argument,<br>
 these sceptics refuse to believe in the possibility of our<br>
 resurrection. It is the attitude of Matthew Arnold who said,<br>
 "Miracles do not happen." Scientifically we know the "how" of few<br>
 things. Paul has an astounding answer to this objection. Death<br>
 itself is the way of resurrection as in the death of the seed for<br>
 the new plant <b><i>(verses <!-#-->36f.)</i></b>. <B>{With what manner of body}</B> <b><i>(\poi&#333;i<br>
 s&#333;mati\)</i></b>. This is the second question which makes plainer the<br>
 difficulty of the first. The first body perishes. Will that body<br>
 be raised? Paul treats this problem more at length <b><i>(verses<br>
 <!-#-->38-54)</i></b> and by analogy of nature <b><i>(Cf. Butler's famous<br>
 _Analogy_)</i></b>. It is a spiritual, not a natural, body that is<br>
 raised. \S&#333;ma\ here is an organism. <B>{Flesh}</B> <b><i>(\sarx\)</i></b> is the<br>
 \s&#333;ma\ for the natural man, but there is spiritual<br>
 <b><i>(\pneumatikon\)</i></b> \s&#333;ma\ for the resurrection.<br>
 <br>
 15:36 <B>{Thou foolish one}</B> <b><i>(\aphr&#333;n\)</i></b>. Old word <b><i>(\a\ privative,<br>
 \phr&#275;n\)</i></b>, lack of sense. It is a severe term and justified by the<br>
 implication "that the objector plumes himself on his acuteness"<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson and Plummer)</i></b>. Proleptic position of \su\ <b><i>(thou)</i></b><br>
 sharpens the point. Sceptics <b><i>(agnostics)</i></b> pose as unusually<br>
 intellectual <b><i>(the intelligentsia)</i></b>, but the pose does not make one<br>
 intelligent. <B>{Except it die}</B> <b><i>(\ean m&#275; apothan&#275;i\)</i></b>. Condition of<br>
 third class, possibility assumed. This is the answer to the "how"<br>
 question. In plant life death precedes life, death of the seed<br>
 and then the new plant.<br>
 <br>
 15:37 <B>{Not the body which shall be}</B> <b><i>(\ou to s&#333;ma to<br>
 gen&#275;somenon\)</i></b>. Articular future participle of \ginomai\,<br>
 literally, "not the body that will become." The new <B>{body}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\s&#333;ma\)</i></b> is not yet in existence, but only the seed <b><i>(\kokkos\,<br>
 grain, old word, as in <!-#-->Mt 13:31)</i></b>. <B>{It may chance}</B> <b><i>(\ei<br>
 tuchoi\)</i></b>. Fourth class condition as in <!-#-->14:10 which see. Paul is<br>
 rich in metaphors here, though usually not so <b><i>(Howson, _Metaphors<br>
 of St. Paul_)</i></b>. Paul was a city man. We sow seeds, not plants<br>
 <b><i>(bodies)</i></b>. The butterfly comes out of the dying worm.<br>
 <br>
 15:38 <B>{A body of its own}</B> <b><i>(\idion s&#333;ma\)</i></b>. Even under the<br>
 microscope the life cells or germ plasm may seem almost<br>
 identical, but the plant is quite distinct. On \sperma\, seed,<br>
 old word from \speir&#333;\, to sow, see on &#175;Mt 13:24f.<br>
 <br>
 15:39 <B>{The same flesh}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; aut&#275; sarx\)</i></b>. Paul takes up animal<br>
 life to show the great variety there is as in the plant kingdom.<br>
 Even if evolution should prove to be true, Paul's argument<br>
 remains valid. Variety exists along with kinship. Progress is<br>
 shown in the different kingdoms, progress that even argues for a<br>
 spiritual body after the body of flesh is lost. <B>{Of beasts}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kt&#275;n&#333;n\)</i></b>. Old word, from \ktaomai\, to possess, and so<br>
 property. See <!-#-->Lu 10:34. <B>{Of birds}</B> <b><i>(\pt&#275;n&#333;n\)</i></b>. Old word from<br>
 \petomai\, to fly, winged, flying. Only here in N.T.<br>
 <br>
 15:40 <B>{Celestial}</B> <b><i>(\epourania\)</i></b>. Old word, from \epi\, upon,<br>
 \ouranos\, heaven, existing in heaven. Paul now rises higher in<br>
 the range of his argument, above the merely <B>{terrestrial}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epigeia\, upon earth, \epi, ge\)</i></b> bodies. He has shown<br>
 differences in the bodies here on earth in plants and in the<br>
 animal kingdom and now he indicates like differences to be seen<br>
 in the heavens above us. <B>{Is one}</B> <b><i>(\hetera men\)</i></b> <B>{--is another}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hetera de\)</i></b>. Antithesis that admits glory for bodies on earth<br>
 and bodies in the heavens. Experience does not argue against a<br>
 glory for the spiritual body <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 3:21)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:41 <B>{For one star differeth from another star in glory}</B> <b><i>(\ast&#275;r<br>
 gar asteros diapherei en dox&#275;i\)</i></b>. A beautiful illustration of<br>
 Paul's point. \Asteros\ is the ablative case after \diapherei\<br>
 <b><i>(old verb \diapher&#333;\, Latin _differo_, our _differ_, bear apart)</i></b>.<br>
 On \ast&#275;r\ see <!-#-->Mt 2:7 and \astron\ <!-#-->Lu 21:25. Stars differ in<br>
 magnitude and brilliancy. The telescope has added more force to<br>
 Paul's argument. <B>{In glory}</B> <b><i>(\en dox&#275;i\)</i></b>. Old word from \doke&#333;\,<br>
 to think, to seem. So opinion, estimate, then the shekinah glory<br>
 of God in the LXX, glory in general. It is one of the great words<br>
 of the N.T. Jesus is termed the glory in <!-#-->Jas 2:1.<br>
 <br>
 15:42 <B>{So is the resurrection of the dead}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s kai h&#275;<br>
 anastasis t&#333;n nekr&#333;n\)</i></b>. Paul now applies his illustrations to his<br>
 argument to prove the kind of body we shall have after the<br>
 resurrection. He does it by a series of marvellous contrasts that<br>
 gather all his points. The earthly and the risen beings differ in<br>
 duration, value, power <b><i>(Wendt)</i></b>. <B>{It is sown}</B> <b><i>(\speiretai\)</i></b>. In<br>
 death, like the seed <b><i>(<!-#-->37)</i></b>. <B>{In incorruption}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 aphtharsi&#257;i\)</i></b>. Late word from \a\ privative and \phtheir&#333;\, to<br>
 corrupt. In LXX, Plutarch, Philo, late papyrus of a Gnostic<br>
 gospel, and quotation from Epicurus. Vulgate _incorruptio_. The<br>
 resurrection body has undergone a complete change as compared<br>
 with the body of flesh like the plant from the seed. It is<br>
 related to it, but it is a different body of glory.<br>
 <br>
 15:43 <B>{In weakness}</B> <b><i>(\en asthenei&#257;i\)</i></b>. Lack of strength as shown<br>
 in the victory of death. <B>{In power}</B> <b><i>(\en dunamei\)</i></b>. Death can<br>
 never conquer this new body, "conformed to the body of His glory"<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 3:21)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:44 <B>{A natural body}</B> <b><i>(\s&#333;ma psuchikon\)</i></b>. See on &#175;2:14 for this<br>
 word, a difficult one to translate since \psuch&#275;\ has so many<br>
 meanings. Natural is probably as good a rendering as can be made,<br>
 but it is not adequate, for the body here is not all \psuch&#275;\<br>
 either as soul or life. The same difficulty exists as to a<br>
 spiritual body <b><i>(\s&#333;ma pneumatikon\)</i></b>. The resurrection body is not<br>
 wholly \pneuma\. Caution is needed here in filling out details<br>
 concerning the \psuch&#275;\ and the \pneuma\. But certainly he means<br>
 to say that the "spiritual body" has some kind of germinal<br>
 connection with the "natural body," though the development is<br>
 glorious beyond our comprehension though not beyond the power of<br>
 Christ to perform <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 3:21)</i></b>. The force of the argument remains<br>
 unimpaired though we cannot follow fully into the thought beyond<br>
 us. <B>{If there is}</B> <b><i>(\ei estin\)</i></b>. "If there exists" <b><i>(\estin\ means<br>
 this with accent on first syllable)</i></b>, a condition of first class<br>
 assumed as true. <B>{There is also}</B> <b><i>(\estin kai\)</i></b>. There exists<br>
 also.<br>
 <br>
 15:45 <B>{Became a living soul}</B> <b><i>(\egeneto eis psuch&#275;n z&#333;san\)</i></b>.<br>
 Hebraistic use of \eis\ in predicate from LXX. God breathed a<br>
 soul <b><i>(\psuch&#275;\)</i></b> into "the first man." <B>{The last Adam became a<br>
 life-giving spirit}</B> <b><i>(\ho eschatos Adam eis pneuma z&#333;opoioun\)</i></b>.<br>
 Supply \egeneto\ <b><i>(became)</i></b>. Christ is the crown of humanity and<br>
 has power to give us the new body. In <!-#-->Ro 5:12-19 Paul calls<br>
 Christ the Second Adam.<br>
 <br>
 15:46 <B>{Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that<br>
 which is natural}</B> <b><i>(\all' ou pr&#333;ton to pneumatikon, alla to<br>
 psuchikon\)</i></b>. Literally, "But not first the spiritual, but the<br>
 natural." This is the law of growth always.<br>
 <br>
 15:47 <B>{Earthly}</B> <b><i>(\cho&#8249;kos\)</i></b>. Late rare word, from \chous\, dust.<br>
 <B>{The second man from heaven}</B> <b><i>(\ho deuteros anthr&#333;pos ex<br>
 ouranou\)</i></b>. Christ had a human <b><i>(\psuchikon\)</i></b> body, of course, but<br>
 Paul makes the contrast between the first man in his natural body<br>
 and the Second Man in his risen body. Paul saw Jesus after his<br>
 resurrection and he appeared to him "from heaven." He will come<br>
 again from heaven.<br>
 <br>
 15:48 <B>{As is the earthly}</B> <b><i>(\hoios ho choikos\)</i></b>. Masculine gender<br>
 because of \anthr&#333;pos\ and correlative pronouns <b><i>(\hoios,<br>
 toioutoi\)</i></b> of character or quality. All men of dust <b><i>(\cho&#8249;koi\)</i></b><br>
 correspond to "the man of dust" <b><i>(\ho cho&#8249;kos\)</i></b>, the first Adam.<br>
 <B>{As is the heavenly}</B> <b><i>(\hoios ho epouranios\)</i></b>. Christ in his<br>
 ascended state <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 4:16; 2Th 1:7; Eph 2:6,20; Php 3:20f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:49 <B>{We shall also bear}</B> <b><i>(\phoresomen kai\)</i></b>. Old MSS. <b><i>(so<br>
 Westcott and Hort)</i></b> read \phores&#333;men kai\. Volitive aorist active<br>
 subjunctive, Let us also bear. Ellicott strongly opposes the<br>
 subjunctive. It may be merely the failure of scribes to<br>
 distinguish between long o and short o. Paul hardly means to say<br>
 that our attaining the resurrection body depends on our own<br>
 efforts! A late frequentative form of \pher&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 15:50 <B>{Cannot inherit}</B> <b><i>(\kl&#275;ronom&#275;sai ou dunantai\)</i></b>. Hence there<br>
 must be a change by death from the natural body to the spiritual<br>
 body. In the case of Christ this change was wrought in less than<br>
 three days and even then the body of Jesus was in a transition<br>
 state before the Ascension. He ate and could be handled and yet<br>
 he passed through closed doors. Paul does not base his argument<br>
 on the special circumstances connected with the risen body of<br>
 Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 15:51 <B>{A mystery}</B> <b><i>(\must&#275;rion\)</i></b>. He does not claim that he has<br>
 explained everything. He has drawn a broad parallel which opens<br>
 the door of hope and confidence. <B>{We shall not all sleep}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pantes ou koim&#275;th&#275;sometha\)</i></b>. Future passive indicative of<br>
 \koimaomai\, to sleep. Not all of us shall die, Paul means. Some<br>
 people will be alive when he comes. Paul does not affirm that he<br>
 or any then living will be alive when Jesus comes again. He<br>
 simply groups all under the phrase "we all." <B>{But we shall all be<br>
 changed}</B> <b><i>(\pantes de allag&#275;sometha\)</i></b>. Second future passive<br>
 indicative of \allass&#333;\. Both living and dead shall be changed<br>
 and so receive the resurrection body. See this same idea at more<br>
 length in <!-#-->1Th 4:13-18.<br>
 <br>
 15:52 <B>{In a moment}</B> <b><i>(\en atom&#333;i\)</i></b>. Old word, from \a\ privative<br>
 and \temn&#333;\, to cut, indivisible: Scientific word for _atom_<br>
 which was considered indivisible, but that was before the day of<br>
 electrons and protons. Only here in N.T. <B>{In the twinkling of an<br>
 eye}</B> <b><i>(\en rip&#275;i ophthalmou\)</i></b>. Old word \rip&#275;\ from \ript&#333;\, to<br>
 throw. Only here in N.T. Used by the Greeks for the flapping of a<br>
 wing, the buzz of a gnat, the quivering of a harp, the twinkling<br>
 of a star. <B>{At the last trump}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i eschat&#275;i salpiggi\)</i></b>.<br>
 Symbolical, of course. See on &#175;1Th 4:16; Mt 24:31.<br>
 <br>
 15:53 <B>{Must put on}</B> <b><i>(\dei endusasthai\)</i></b>. Aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b><br>
 middle infinitive, put on as a garment. <B>{Immortality}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\athanasian\)</i></b>. Old word from \athanatos\, undying, and that from<br>
 \a\ privative and \thn&#275;sk&#333;\, to die. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->1Ti<br>
 6:16 where God is described as having immortality.<br>
 <br>
 15:54 <B>{Shall have put on}</B> <b><i>(\endus&#275;tai\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 subjunctive with \hotan\ whenever, merely indefinite future, no<br>
 _futurum exactum_, merely meaning, "whenever shall put on," not<br>
 "shall have put on." <B>{Is swallowed up}</B> <b><i>(\katepoth&#275;\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive indicative of \katapin&#333;\, old verb to drink down,<br>
 swallow down. Perfective use of \kata-\ where we say "up,"<br>
 "swallow up." Timeless use of the aorist tense. Paul changes the<br>
 active voice \katepien\ in <!-#-->Isa 25:8 to the passive. Death is no<br>
 longer victory. Theodotion reads the Hebrew verb <b><i>(_bulla_, for<br>
 _billa_,)</i></b> as passive like Paul. It is the "final overthrow of the<br>
 king of Terrors" <b><i>(Findlay)</i></b> as shown in <!-#-->Heb 2:15.<br>
 <br>
 15:55 <B>{Victory}</B> <b><i>(\nikos\)</i></b>. Late form of \nik&#275;\. <B>{O death}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\thanate\)</i></b>. Second instance. Here Paul changes Hades of the LXX<br>
 for Hebrew Sheol <b><i>(<!-#-->Hos 13:14)</i></b> to death. Paul never uses Hades.<br>
 <B>{Thy sting}</B> <b><i>(\sou to kentron\)</i></b>. Old word from \kentre&#333;\, to<br>
 prick, as in <!-#-->Ac 26:14. In <!-#-->Re 9:10 of the sting of locusts,<br>
 scorpions. The serpent death has lost his poison fangs.<br>
 <br>
 15:56 <B>{The power of sin}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; dunamis t&#275;s hamartias\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ro<br>
 4:15; 5:20; 6:14; 7; Ga 2:16; 3:1-5:4 for Paul's ideas here<br>
 briefly expressed. In man's unrenewed state he cannot obey God's<br>
 holy law.<br>
 <br>
 15:57 <B>{But thanks be to God}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i de the&#333;i charis\)</i></b>. Exultant<br>
 triumph through Christ over sin and death as in <!-#-->Ro 7:25.<br>
 <br>
 15:58 <B>{Be ye steadfast, unmovable}</B> <b><i>(\hedraioi ginesthe,<br>
 ametakin&#275;toi\)</i></b>. "Keep on becoming steadfast, unshaken." Let the<br>
 sceptics howl and rage. Paul has given rational grounds for faith<br>
 and hope in Christ the Risen Lord and Saviour. Note practical<br>
 turn to this great doctrinal argument. <B>{Work}</B> <b><i>(\ergon\)</i></b>, <B>{labour}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kopos\, toil)</i></b>. The best answer to doubt is work.<br>
