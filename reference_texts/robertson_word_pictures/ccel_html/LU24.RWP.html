<p>24:1 <B>{At early dawn}</B> <b><i>(\orthrou batheos\)</i></b>. Genitive of time.<br>
 Literally, at deep dawn. The adjective \bathus\ <b><i>(deep)</i></b> was often<br>
 used of time. This very idiom occurs in Aristophanes, Plato, et<br>
 cetera. <!-#-->Joh 20:1 adds "while it was yet dark." That is, when<br>
 they started, for the sun was risen when they arrived <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 16:2)</i></b>. <B>{Which they had prepared}</B> <b><i>(\ha h&#275;toimasan\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr 16:1<br>
 notes that they bought other spices after the sabbath was over<br>
 besides those which they already had <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:56)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:2 <B>{Rolled away}</B> <b><i>(\apokekulismenon\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle of \apokuli&#333;\, late verb and in the N.T. only in this<br>
 context <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 16:3; Mt 28:2)</i></b> while <!-#-->Joh 20:1 has \&#275;rmenon\<br>
 <b><i>(taken away)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:3 <B>{Of the Lord Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\tou kuriou I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. The Western family<br>
 of documents does not have these words and Westcott and Hort<br>
 bracket them as Western non-interpolations. There are numerous<br>
 instances of this shorter Western text in this chapter. For a<br>
 discussion of the subject see my _Introduction to the Textual<br>
 Criticism of the New Testament_, pp. 225-237. This precise<br>
 combination <b><i>(the Lord Jesus)</i></b> is common in the Acts, but nowhere<br>
 else in the Gospels.<br>
 <br>
 24:4 <B>{While they were perplexed thereabout}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i aporeisthai<br>
 autas peri toutou\)</i></b>. Luke's common Hebraistic idiom, \en\ with<br>
 the articular infinitive <b><i>(present passive \aporeisthai\ from<br>
 \apore&#333;\, to lose one's way)</i></b> and the accusative of general<br>
 reference. <B>{Two men}</B> <b><i>(\andres duo\)</i></b>. Men, not women. <!-#-->Mr 16:5<br>
 speaks of a young man <b><i>(\neaniskon\)</i></b> while <!-#-->Mt 28:5 has "an<br>
 angel." We need not try to reconcile these varying accounts which<br>
 agree in the main thing. The angel looked like a man and some<br>
 remembered two. In verse <!-#-->23 Cleopas and his companion call them<br>
 "angels." <B>{Stood by}</B> <b><i>(\epest&#275;san\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative of \ephist&#275;mi\. This common verb usually means to step<br>
 up suddenly, to burst upon one. <B>{In dazzling apparel}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 esth&#275;ti astraptous&#275;i\)</i></b>. This is the correct text. This common<br>
 simplex verb occurs only twice in the N.T., here and <!-#-->Lu 17:24<br>
 <b><i>(the Transfiguration)</i></b>. It has the same root as \astrap&#275;\<br>
 <b><i>(lightning)</i></b>. The "men" had the garments of "angels."<br>
 <br>
 24:5 <B>{As they were affrighted}</B> <b><i>(\emphob&#333;n genomen&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute with second aorist middle of \ginomai\, to<br>
 become. Hence, <B>{when they became affrighted}</B>. They had utterly<br>
 forgotten the prediction of Jesus that he would rise on the third<br>
 day.<br>
 <br>
 24:6 <B>{He is not here, but is risen}</B> <b><i>(\ouk estin h&#333;de, alla<br>
 &#275;gerth&#275;\)</i></b>. Another Western non-interpolation according to<br>
 Westcott and Hort. The words are genuine at any rate in <!-#-->Mr 16:6;<br>
 Mt 28:7. <B>{The third day rise again}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i trit&#275;i h&#275;mer&#257;i<br>
 anast&#275;nai\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->9:22; 18:32,33 where Jesus plainly foretold<br>
 this fact. And yet they had forgotten it, for it ran counter to<br>
 all their ideas and hopes.<br>
 <br>
 24:9 <B>{From the tomb}</B> <b><i>(\apo tou mn&#275;meiou\)</i></b>. Some documents omit<br>
 these words. This word for tomb is like our "memorial" from<br>
 \mimn&#275;sk&#333;\, to remind. <B>{Told}</B> <b><i>(\ap&#275;ggeilan\)</i></b>. It was a wonderful<br>
 proclamation. Luke does not separate the story of Mary Magdalene<br>
 from that of the other women as John does <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 20:2-18)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:11 <B>{As idle talk}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s l&#275;ros\)</i></b>. Old word for nonsense, only<br>
 here in the N.T. Medical writers used it for the wild talk of<br>
 those in delirium or hysteria. <B>{Disbelieved}</B> <b><i>(&#275;pistoun)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active of \apiste&#333;\, old verb from \apistos\, without<br>
 confidence or faith in. They kept on distrusting the story of the<br>
 women.<br>
 <br>
 24:12 This entire verse is a Western non-interpolation. This<br>
 incident is given in complete form in <!-#-->Joh 18:2-10 and most of<br>
 the words in this verse are there also. It is of a piece with<br>
 many items in this chapter about which it is not easy to reach a<br>
 final conclusion. <B>{Stooping and looking in}</B> <b><i>(\parakupsas\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active participle of \parakupt&#333;\, to stoop besides and<br>
 peer into. Old verb used also in <!-#-->Joh 20:5,11; Jas 1:25; 1Pe<br>
 1:12. <B>{By themselves}</B> <b><i>(\mona\)</i></b>. Without the body. <B>{To his home}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pros hauton\)</i></b>. Literally, "to himself."<br>
 <br>
 24:13 <B>{Were going}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san poreuomenoi\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect<br>
 middle of \poreuomai\. <B>{Sixty stadia}</B> <b><i>(\stadious hex&#275;konta\)</i></b>.<br>
 About seven miles.<br>
 <br>
 24:14 <B>{They communed}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;miloun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of<br>
 \homile&#333;\, old and common verb <b><i>(from \homilos\, in company with)</i></b>.<br>
 In the N.T. only here <b><i>(and verse <!-#-->15)</i></b> and <!-#-->Ac 20:11; 24:26. Our<br>
 word homiletics is derived from this word for preaching was at<br>
 first largely conversational in style and not declamatory.<br>
 <br>
 24:15 <B>{While they communed and questioned together}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i<br>
 homilein autous kai sunz&#275;tein\)</i></b>. Same idiom as in verse <!-#-->14,<br>
 which see. Note \sunz&#275;tein\; each questioned the other. <B>{Jesus<br>
 himself}</B> <b><i>(\autos I&#275;sous\)</i></b>. In actual person. <B>{Went with them}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\suneporeueto autois\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, was going along with<br>
 them.<br>
 <br>
 24:16 <B>{Were holden that they should not know him}</B> <b><i>(\ekratounto<br>
 tou m&#275; epign&#333;nai auton\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive of \krate&#333;\,<br>
 continued being held, with the ablative case of the articular<br>
 infinitive, "from recognizing him," from knowing him fully<br>
 <b><i>(\epi-gn&#333;nai\, ingressive aorist of \epigin&#333;sko\)</i></b>. The \m&#275;\ is a<br>
 redundant negative after the negative idea in \ekratounto\.<br>
 <br>
 24:17 <B>{That you have with another}</B> <b><i>(\hous antiballete pros<br>
 all&#275;lous\)</i></b>. \Anti-ball&#333;\ is an old verb and means to throw in<br>
 turn, back and forth like a ball, from one to another, a<br>
 beautiful picture of conversation as a game of words. Only here<br>
 in the N.T. <B>{They stood still}</B> <b><i>(\estath&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive of \hist&#275;mi\, intransitive. They stopped. <B>{Looking sad}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\skuthr&#333;poi\)</i></b>. This is the correct text. It is an old adjective<br>
 from \skuthros\, gloomy and \ops\, countenance. Only here in the<br>
 N.T.<br>
 <br>
 24:18 <B>{Dost thou alone sojourn?}</B> <b><i>(\su monos paroikeis;\)</i></b>. \Monos\<br>
 is predicate adjective. "Hast thou been dwelling alone <b><i>(all by<br>
 thyself)</i></b>?" <B>{And not know?}</B> <b><i>(\kai ouk egn&#333;s;\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active indicative and difficult to put into English as the aorist<br>
 often is. The verb \paroike&#333;\ means to dwell beside one, then as<br>
 a stranger like \paroikoi\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph 2:19)</i></b>. In Jerusalem everybody<br>
 was talking about Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 24:21 <B>{But we hoped}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meis de &#275;lpizomen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active,<br>
 we were hoping. Note emphasis in \h&#275;meis\ <b><i>(we)</i></b>. <B>{Redeem}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\lutrousthai\)</i></b>. From the bondage of Rome, no doubt. <B>{Yea and<br>
 beside all this}</B> <b><i>(\alla ge kai sun p&#257;sin toutois\)</i></b>. Particles<br>
 pile up to express their emotions. <B>{Yea}</B> <b><i>(\alla\ here<br>
 affirmative, as in verse <!-#-->22, not adversative)</i></b> at least <b><i>(\ge\)</i></b><br>
 also <b><i>(\kai\)</i></b> together with all these things <b><i>(\sun p&#257;sin<br>
 toutois\)</i></b>. Like Pelion on Ossa with them in their perplexity.<br>
 <B>{Now the third day}</B> <b><i>(\trit&#275;n taut&#275;n h&#275;meran agei\)</i></b>. A difficult<br>
 idiom for the English. "One is keeping this a third day." And he<br>
 is still dead and we are still without hope.<br>
 <br>
 24:22 <B>{Amazed us}</B> <b><i>(\exest&#275;san h&#275;mas\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 <b><i>(transitive)</i></b> indicative with accusative \h&#275;mas\ of \exist&#275;mi\.<br>
 The second aorist active is intransitive. <B>{Early}</B> <b><i>(\orthrinai\)</i></b>.<br>
 A poetic and late form for \orthrios\. In the N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->Re 24:22. Predicate adjective agreeing with the women.<br>
 <br>
 24:23 <B>{Had seen}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;rakenai\)</i></b>. Perfect active infinitive in<br>
 indirect assertion after \legousai\. Same construction for \z&#275;in\<br>
 after \legousin\. But all this was too indirect and uncertain<br>
 <b><i>(women and angels)</i></b> for Cleopas and his companion.<br>
 <br>
 24:25 <B>{Foolish men}</B> <b><i>(\ano&#275;toi\)</i></b>. Literally without sense<br>
 <b><i>(\nous\)</i></b>, not understanding. Common word. <B>{Slow of heart}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\bradeis t&#275;i kardi&#257;i\)</i></b>. Slow in heart <b><i>(locative case)</i></b>. Old word<br>
 for one dull, slow to comprehend or to act. <B>{All that}</B> <b><i>(\p&#257;sin<br>
 hois\)</i></b>. Relative attracted from the accusative \ha\ to the case<br>
 of the antecedent \p&#257;sin\ <b><i>(dative)</i></b>. They could only understand<br>
 part of the prophecies, not all.<br>
 <br>
 24:26 <B>{Behooved it not?}</B> <b><i>(\ouchi edei;\)</i></b>. Was it not necessary?<br>
 The very things about the death of Jesus that disturbed them so<br>
 were the strongest proof that he was the Messiah of the Old<br>
 Testament.<br>
 <br>
 24:27 <B>{Interpreted}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;rm&#275;neusen\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 <b><i>(constative aorist)</i></b> indicative of \dierm&#275;neu&#333;\ <b><i>(Margin has the<br>
 imperfect \di&#275;rm&#275;neuen\)</i></b>, intensive compound <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> of<br>
 \herm&#275;neu&#333;\, the old verb to interpret from \herm&#275;neus\,<br>
 interpreter, and that from \Herm&#275;s\, the messenger of the gods as<br>
 the people of Lystra took Paul to be <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 14:12)</i></b>. But what<br>
 wonderful exegesis the two disciples were now hearing!<br>
 <B>{Concerning himself}</B> <b><i>(\peri heauton\)</i></b>. Jesus found himself in the<br>
 Old Testament, a thing that some modern scholars do not seem able<br>
 to do.<br>
 <br>
 24:28 <B>{Made as though}</B> <b><i>(\prosepoi&#275;sato\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 middle <b><i>(Some MSS. have \prosepoieito\ imperfect)</i></b> indicative of<br>
 \prospoie&#333;\, old verb to conform oneself to, to pretend. Only<br>
 here in the N.T. Of course he would have gone on if the disciples<br>
 had not urged him to stay.<br>
 <br>
 24:29 <B>{Constrained}</B> <b><i>(\parebiasanto\)</i></b>. Strong verb \parabiazomai\,<br>
 to compel by use of force <b><i>(Polybius and LXX)</i></b>. In the N.T. only<br>
 here and <!-#-->Ac 16:15. It was here compulsion of courteous words.<br>
 <B>{Is far spent}</B> <b><i>(\kekliken\)</i></b>. Perfect active indicative of<br>
 \klin&#333;\. The day "has turned" toward setting.<br>
 <br>
 24:30 <B>{When he had sat down}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i kataklith&#275;nai auton\)</i></b>.<br>
 Luke's common idiom as in verses <!-#-->4,15. Note first aorist<br>
 passive infinitive <b><i>(on the reclining as to him)</i></b>. <B>{Gave}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epedidou\)</i></b>. Imperfect, inchoative idea, began to give to them,<br>
 in contrast with the preceding aorist <b><i>(punctiliar)</i></b> participles.<br>
 <br>
 24:31 <B>{Were opened}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;noichth&#275;san\)</i></b>. Ingressive first aorist<br>
 passive indicative of \dianoig&#333;\. <B>{Knew}</B> <b><i>(\epegn&#333;san\)</i></b>. Effective<br>
 first aorist active indicative fully recognized him. Same word in<br>
 verse <!-#-->16. <B>{Vanished}</B> <b><i>(\aphantos egeneto\)</i></b>. Became invisible or<br>
 unmanifested. \Aphantos\ from \a\ privative and \phainomai\, to<br>
 appear. Old word, only here in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 24:32 <B>{Was not our heart burning?}</B> <b><i>(\Ouchi h&#275; kardia hem&#333;n<br>
 kaiomen&#275; &#275;n;\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect middle. <B>{Spake}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\elalei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, was speaking. This common verb<br>
 \lale&#333;\ is onomatopoetic, to utter a sound, \la-la\ and was used<br>
 of birds, children chattering, and then for conversation, for<br>
 preaching, for any public speech. <B>{Opened}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;noigen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active indicative of the same verb used of the eyes in<br>
 verse <!-#-->31.<br>
 <br>
 24:33 <B>{That very hour}</B> <b><i>(\aut&#275;i t&#275;i h&#333;r&#257;i\)</i></b>. Locative case and<br>
 common Lukan idiom, at the hour itself. They could not wait.<br>
 <B>{Gathered}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;throismenous\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of<br>
 \athroiz&#333;\, old verb from \athroos\ <b><i>(copulative \a\ and \throos\,<br>
 crowd)</i></b>. Only here in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 24:34 <B>{Saying}</B> <b><i>(\legontas\)</i></b>. Accusative present active participle<br>
 agreeing with "the eleven and those with them" in verse <!-#-->33.<br>
 <B>{Indeed}</B> <b><i>(\ont&#333;s\)</i></b>. Really, because "he has appeared to Simon"<br>
 <b><i>(\&#333;pth&#275; Sim&#333;ni\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of \hora&#333;\.<br>
 This is the crucial evidence that turned the scales with the<br>
 disciples and explains "indeed." Paul also mentions it <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 15:5)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:35 <B>{Rehearsed}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#275;gounto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle indicative of<br>
 \ex&#275;geomai\, verb to lead out, to rehearse. Our word exegesis<br>
 comes from this verb. Their story was now confirmatory, not<br>
 revolutionary. The women were right then after all. <B>{Of them}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\autois\)</i></b>. To them, dative case. They did not recognize Jesus in<br>
 his exegesis, but did in the breaking of bread. One is reminded<br>
 of that saying in the _Logia of Jesus_: "Raise the stone and<br>
 there thou shalt find me, cleave the wood and there am I."<br>
 <br>
 24:36 <B>{He himself stood}</B> <b><i>(\autos est&#275;\)</i></b>. He himself stepped and<br>
 stood. Some documents do not have "Peace be unto you."<br>
 <br>
 24:37 <B>{Terrified}</B> <b><i>(\pto&#275;thentes\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 participle of \ptoe&#333;\, old verb and in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu<br>
 21:9 which see. <B>{Affrighted}</B> <b><i>(\emphoboi genomenoi\)</i></b>. Late<br>
 adjective from \en\ and \phobos\ <b><i>(fear)</i></b>. Both these terms of fear<br>
 are strong. <B>{Supposed}</B> <b><i>(\edokoun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \doke&#333;\,<br>
 kept on thinking so.<br>
 <br>
 24:38 <B>{Why are ye troubled?}</B> <b><i>(\ti tetaragmenoi este;\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic perfect passive indicative of \tarass&#333;\, old verb,<br>
 to agitate, to stir up, to get excited.<br>
 <br>
 24:39 <B>{Myself}</B> <b><i>(\autos\)</i></b>. Jesus is patient with his proof. They<br>
 were convinced before he came into the room, but that<br>
 psychological shock had unnerved them all. <B>{Handle}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ps&#275;laph&#275;sate\)</i></b>. This very word is used in <!-#-->1Jo 1:1 as proof of<br>
 the actual human body of Jesus. It is an old verb for touching<br>
 with the hand. <B>{Flesh and bones}</B> <b><i>(\sarka kai ostea\)</i></b>. At least<br>
 this proves that he is not just a ghost and that Jesus had a real<br>
 human body against the Docetic Gnostics who denied it. But<br>
 clearly we are not to understand that our resurrection bodies<br>
 will have "flesh and bones." Jesus was in a transition state and<br>
 had not yet been glorified. The mystery remains unsolved, but it<br>
 was proof to the disciples of the identity of the Risen Christ<br>
 with Jesus of Nazareth.<br>
 <br>
 24:40 Another Western non-interpolation according to Westcott and<br>
 Hort. It is genuine in <!-#-->Joh 20:20.<br>
 <br>
 24:41 <B>{Disbelieved for joy}</B> <b><i>(\apistount&#333;n aut&#333;n apo t&#275;s charas\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute and a quite understandable attitude. They were<br>
 slowly reconvinced, but it was after all too good to be true.<br>
 <B>{Anything to eat}</B> <b><i>(\br&#333;simon\)</i></b>. Only here in the N.T., though an<br>
 old word from \bibr&#333;sk&#333;\, to eat.<br>
 <br>
 24:42 <B>{A piece of broiled fish}</B> <b><i>(\ichthuos optou meros\)</i></b>. \Optos\<br>
 is a verbal from \opta&#333;\, to cook, to roast, to broil. Common<br>
 word, but only here in the N.T. The best old documents omit "and<br>
 a honeycomb" <b><i>(\kai apo melissiou k&#275;riou\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:44 <B>{While I was yet with you}</B> <b><i>(\eti &#333;n sun humin\)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 <B>{Being yet with you}</B>. The participle \&#333;n\ takes the time of the<br>
 principal verb.<br>
 <br>
 24:45 <B>{Opened he their mind}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;noixen aut&#333;n ton noun\)</i></b>. The<br>
 same verb as that in verses <!-#-->31,32 about the eyes and the<br>
 Scriptures. Jesus had all these years been trying to open their<br>
 minds that they might understand the Scriptures about the Messiah<br>
 and now at last he makes one more effort in the light of the<br>
 Cross and the Resurrection. They can now see better the will and<br>
 way of God, but they will still need the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
 before they will fully know the mind of Christ.<br>
 <br>
 24:46 <B>{It is written}</B> <b><i>(\gegraptai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative<br>
 of \graph&#333;\, to write, the usual phrase for quoting Scripture.<br>
 Jesus now finds in the Old Testament his suffering, his<br>
 resurrection, and the preaching of repentance and forgiveness of<br>
 sins to all nations. Note the infinitives \pathein, anast&#275;nai,<br>
 k&#275;ruchth&#275;nai\.<br>
 <br>
 24:47 <B>{Beginning}</B> <b><i>(\arxamenoi\)</i></b>. Aorist middle participle of<br>
 \arch&#333;\, but the nominative plural with no syntactical connection<br>
 <b><i>(an anacoluthon)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:49 <B>{Until ye be clothed}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s hou endus&#275;sthe\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 middle subjunctive of \endu&#333;\ or \endun&#333;\. It is an old verb for<br>
 putting on a garment. It is here the indirect middle, put on<br>
 yourselves power from on high as a garment. They are to wait till<br>
 this experience comes to them. This is "the promise of the<br>
 Father." It is an old metaphor in Homer, Aristophanes, Plutarch,<br>
 and Paul uses it often.<br>
 <br>
 24:50 <B>{Over against Bethany}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s pros B&#275;thanian\)</i></b>. That is on<br>
 Olivet. On this blessed spot near where he had delivered the<br>
 great Eschatological Discourse he could see Bethany and<br>
 Jerusalem.<br>
 <br>
 24:51 <B>{He parted from them}</B> <b><i>(\diest&#275; ap' aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b> indicative of \diist&#275;mi\. He stood apart<br>
 <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> and he was gone. Some manuscripts do not have the words<br>
 "and was carried into heaven." But we know that Jesus was taken<br>
 up into heaven on a cloud <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 1:9)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 24:52 <B>{Worshipped him}</B> <b><i>(\proskun&#275;santes auton\)</i></b>. Here again we<br>
 have one of Westcott and Hort's Western non-interpolations that<br>
 may be genuine or not. <B>{With great joy}</B> <b><i>(\meta charas megal&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Now that the Ascension has come they are no longer in despair.<br>
 Joy becomes the note of victory as it is today. No other note can<br>
 win victories for Christ. The bells rang in heaven to greet the<br>
 return of Jesus there, but he set the carillon of joy to ringing<br>
 on earth in human hearts in all lands and for all time.<br>
