<p>9:1 <B>{Till they see the kingdom of God come with power}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s an<br>
 id&#333;sin t&#275;n basileian tou theou el&#275;luthuian en dunamei\)</i></b>. In<br>
 <!-#-->8:38 Jesus clearly is speaking of the second coming. To what is<br>
 he referring in <!-#-->9:1? One is reminded of <!-#-->Mr 13:32; Mt 24:36<br>
 where Jesus expressly denies that anyone save the Father himself<br>
 <b><i>(not even the Son)</i></b> knows the day or the hour. Does he contradict<br>
 that here? It may be observed that Luke has only "see the kingdom<br>
 of God," while Matthew has "see the Son of man coming"<br>
 <b><i>(\erchomenon\, present participle, a process)</i></b>. Mark has "see the<br>
 kingdom of God come" <b><i>(\el&#275;luthuian\, perfect active participle,<br>
 already come)</i></b> and adds "with power." Certainly the second coming<br>
 did not take place while some of those standing there still<br>
 lived. Did Jesus mean that? The very next incident in the<br>
 Synoptic Gospels is the Transfiguration on Mount Hermon. Does not<br>
 Jesus have that in mind here? The language will apply also to the<br>
 coming of the Holy Spirit on the great Day of Pentecost. Some see<br>
 in it a reference to the destruction of the temple. It is at<br>
 least open to question whether the Master is speaking of the same<br>
 event in <!-#-->Mr 8:38; 9:1.<br>
 <br>
 9:2 <B>{By themselves}</B> <b><i>(\monous\)</i></b>. Alone. This word only in Mark.<br>
 See on &#175;Mt 17:1-8 for discussion of the Transfiguration. <!-#-->Lu<br>
 9:28 adds "to pray" as the motive of Jesus in taking Peter,<br>
 James, and John into the high mountain.<br>
 <br>
 9:3 <B>{Glistering, exceeding white}</B> <b><i>(\stilbonta leuka lian\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 words, all of them. <!-#-->Mt 17:2 has <B>{white as the light}</B> <b><i>(\leuka<br>
 h&#333;s to ph&#333;s\)</i></b>, <!-#-->Lu 9:29 "white and dazzling" <b><i>(\leukos<br>
 exastrapt&#333;n\)</i></b> like lightning. <B>{So as no fuller on earth can<br>
 whiten them}</B> <b><i>(\hoia gnapheus epi t&#275;s g&#275;s ou dunatai hout&#333;s<br>
 leuk&#257;nai\)</i></b>. \Gnaph&#333;\ is an old word to card wool. Note \hout&#333;s\,<br>
 so, so white. Some manuscripts in Matthew add \h&#333;s chi&#333;n\, as<br>
 snow. Probably the snow-capped summit of Hermon was visible on<br>
 this very night. See on &#175;Mt 17:2 for "transfigured."<br>
 <br>
 9:4 <B>{Elijah with Moses}</B> <b><i>(\Eleias sun M&#333;usei\)</i></b>. Matthew and Luke<br>
 have "Moses and Elijah." Both, as a matter of fact were prophets<br>
 and both dealt with law. Both had mysterious deaths. The other<br>
 order in <!-#-->Mr 9:5.<br>
 <br>
 9:6 <B>{For he wist not what to answer}</B> <b><i>(\ou gar &#275;idei ti<br>
 apokrith&#275;i\)</i></b>. Deliberative subjunctive retained in indirect<br>
 question. But why did Peter say anything? Luke says that he<br>
 spoke, "not knowing what he said," as an excuse for the<br>
 inappropriateness of his remarks. Perhaps Peter felt embarrassed<br>
 at having been asleep <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:32)</i></b> and the feast of tabernacles or<br>
 booths <b><i>(\sk&#275;nai\)</i></b> was near. See on &#175;Mt 17:4. Peter and the<br>
 others apparently had not heard the talk of Moses and Elijah with<br>
 Jesus about his decease <b><i>(\exodon\, exodus, departure)</i></b> and little<br>
 knew the special comfort that Jesus had found in this<br>
 understanding of the great approaching tragedy concerning which<br>
 Peter had shown absolute stupidity <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 8:32f.)</i></b> so recently. See<br>
 on &#175;Mt 17:5 about the overshadowing and the voice.<br>
 <br>
 9:8 <B>{Suddenly looking round about}</B> <b><i>(\exapina periblepsamenoi\)</i></b>.<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 17:8 has it "lifting up their eyes." Mark is more graphic.<br>
 The sudden glance around on the mountain side when the cloud with<br>
 Moses and Elijah was gone. <B>{Jesus only with themselves}</B> <b><i>(\meth'<br>
 heaut&#333;n ei m&#275; I&#275;soun monon\)</i></b>. Mark shows their surprise at the<br>
 situation. They were sore afraid <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 17:6)</i></b> before Jesus touched<br>
 them.<br>
 <br>
 9:9 <B>{Save when}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275; hotan\)</i></b>. Matthew has "until" <b><i>(\he&#333;s<br>
 hou\)</i></b>. <B>{Should have risen}</B> <b><i>(\anast&#275;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 subjunctive. More exactly, "should rise" <b><i>(punctiliar aorist and<br>
 futuristic, not with any idea of perfect tense)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu 9:36 merely<br>
 says that they told no man any of these things. It was a high and<br>
 holy secret experience that the chosen three had had for their<br>
 future good and for the good of all.<br>
 <br>
 9:10 <B>{They kept the saying}</B> <b><i>(\ton logon ekrat&#275;san\)</i></b> to themselves<br>
 as Jesus had directed, but <B>{questioning among themselves}</B> <b><i>(\pros<br>
 heautous sunz&#275;tountes\)</i></b>. Now they notice his allusion to rising<br>
 from the dead which had escaped them before <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 8:31)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:12 <B>{Restoreth all things}</B> <b><i>(\apokatistanei panta\)</i></b>. This late<br>
 double compound verb, usual form \apokathist&#275;mi\ in the papyri,<br>
 is Christ's description of the Baptist as the promised Elijah and<br>
 Forerunner of the Messiah. See on &#175;Mt 17:10-13. The disciples<br>
 had not till now understood that the Baptist fulfilled the<br>
 prophecy in <!-#-->Mal 3:5f. They had just seen Elijah on the<br>
 mountain, but Jesus as Messiah preceded this coming of Elijah.<br>
 But Jesus patiently enlightens his dull pupils as they argue<br>
 about the exegesis of the scribes.<br>
 <br>
 9:14 <B>{And scribes questioning with them}</B> <b><i>(\kai grammateis<br>
 sunz&#275;tountes pros autous\)</i></b>. Mark alone gives this item. He is<br>
 much fuller on this incident <b><i>(<!-#-->9:14-29)</i></b> than either Matthew <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 17:14-20)</i></b> or Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:37-43)</i></b>. It was just like the<br>
 professional scribes to take keen interest in the failure of the<br>
 nine disciples to cure this poor boy. They gleefully nagged and<br>
 quizzed them. Jesus and the three find them at it when they<br>
 arrive in the plain.<br>
 <br>
 9:15 <B>{Were greatly amazed}</B> <b><i>(\exethamb&#275;th&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive ingressive aorist with perfective compound \ex-\. The<br>
 sudden and opportune appearance of Jesus in the midst of the<br>
 dispute when no one was looking for him turned all eyes to him.<br>
 He would not fail, however the disciples might do so. The people<br>
 were awed for the moment and then running began to welcome him<br>
 <b><i>(\protrechontes &#275;spazonto\)</i></b>. Present participle and imperfect<br>
 middle indicative.<br>
 <br>
 9:16 <B>{What question ye with them?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti sunz&#275;teite pros<br>
 autous;\)</i></b>. Jesus had noticed the embarrassment of the nine and at<br>
 once takes hold of the situation.<br>
 <br>
 9:17 <B>{I brought unto thee my son}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;negka ton huion mou pros<br>
 se\)</i></b>. The father stepped out and gave the explanation of the<br>
 excited dispute in direct and simple pathos.<br>
 <br>
 9:18 <B>{Wheresoever it taketh him}</B> <b><i>(\hopou ean auton katalab&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Seizes him down. Our word catalepsy is this same word. The word<br>
 is used by Galen and Hippocrates for fits. The word is very<br>
 common in the papyri in various senses as in the older Greek.<br>
 Each of the verbs here in Mark is a graphic picture. <B>{Dashes<br>
 down}</B> <b><i>(\r&#275;ssei\)</i></b>. Also \r&#275;gnumi, mi\ form. Convulses, rends,<br>
 tears asunder. Old and common word. <B>{Foameth}</B> <b><i>(\aphrizei\)</i></b>. Here<br>
 only in the N.T. Poetic and late word. <B>{Grindeth}</B> <b><i>(\trizei\)</i></b>.<br>
 Another _hapax legomenon_ in the N.T. Old word for making a<br>
 shrill cry or squeak. <B>{Pineth away}</B> <b><i>(\x&#275;rainetai\)</i></b>. Old word for<br>
 drying or withering as of grass in <!-#-->Jas 1:11. <B>{And they were not<br>
 able}</B> <b><i>(\kai ouk ischusan\)</i></b>. They did not have the strength<br>
 <b><i>(\ischus\)</i></b> to handle this case. See <!-#-->Mt 17:16; Lu 9:40 <b><i>(\kai ouk<br>
 &#275;dun&#275;th&#275;san\, first aorist passive)</i></b>. It was a tragedy.<br>
 <br>
 9:19 <B>{Bring him unto me}</B> <b><i>(\pherete auton pros me\)</i></b>. The disciples<br>
 had failed and their unbelief had led to this fiasco. Even the<br>
 disciples were like and part of the <B>{faithless}</B> <b><i>(\apistos\,<br>
 unbelieving)</i></b> generation in which they lived. The word <B>{faithless}</B><br>
 does not here mean treacherous as it does with us. But Jesus is<br>
 not afraid to undertake this case. We can always come to Jesus<br>
 when others fail us.<br>
 <br>
 9:20 <B>{Tare him grievously}</B> <b><i>(\sunesparaxen auton\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu 9:42 has<br>
 both \err&#275;xen\ <b><i>(dashed down, like <!-#-->Mr 9:18, \r&#275;ssei\)</i></b> and<br>
 \sunesparaxen\ <b><i>(convulsed)</i></b>. This compound with \sun-\ <b><i>(together<br>
 with)</i></b>, strengthens the force of the verb as in \sunpnig&#333;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 4:7)</i></b> and \sunt&#275;re&#333;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->6:20)</i></b>. The only other instance of this<br>
 compound verb known is in Maximus Tyrius <b><i>(second century B.C.)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Wallowed}</B> <b><i>(\ekulieto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive, was rolled. A pitiful<br>
 sight. Late form of the old \kulind&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 9:22 <B>{But if thou canst}</B> <b><i>(\all 'ei ti dun&#275;i\)</i></b>. Jesus had asked<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->21)</i></b> the history of the case like a modern physician. The<br>
 father gave it and added further pathetic details about the fire<br>
 and the water. The failure of the disciples had not wholly<br>
 destroyed his faith in the power of Jesus, though the conditional<br>
 form <b><i>(first class, assuming it to be true)</i></b> does suggest doubt<br>
 whether the boy can be cured at all. It was a chronic and<br>
 desperate case of epilepsy with the demon possession added. <B>{Help<br>
 us}</B> <b><i>(\boeth&#275;son hemin\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist imperative. Do it now.<br>
 With touching tenderness he makes the boy's case his own as the<br>
 Syrophoenician woman had said, "Have mercy on me" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 15:21)</i></b>.<br>
 The leper had said: "If thou wilt" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:40)</i></b>. This father says:<br>
 "If thou canst."<br>
 <br>
 9:23 <B>{If thou canst}</B> <b><i>(\to ei dun&#275;i\)</i></b>. The Greek has a neat idiom<br>
 not preserved in the English translation. The article takes up<br>
 the very words of the man and puts the clause in the accusative<br>
 case of general reference. "As to the 'if thou canst,' all things<br>
 can <b><i>(\dunata\)</i></b> to the one who believes." The word for "possible"<br>
 is \dunata\, the same root as \dun&#275;i\ <b><i>(canst)</i></b>. This quick turn<br>
 challenges the father's faith. On this use of the Greek article<br>
 see Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 766.<br>
 <br>
 9:24 <B>{Cried out}</B> <b><i>(\kraxas\)</i></b>. Loud outcry and at once <b><i>(\euthus\)</i></b>.<br>
 The later manuscripts have "with tears" <b><i>(\meta dakru&#333;n\)</i></b>, not in<br>
 the older documents. <B>{I believe; help my unbelief}</B> <b><i>(\Pisteu&#333;:<br>
 bo&#275;thei t&#275;i apisti&#257;i\)</i></b>. An exact description of his mental and<br>
 spiritual state. He still had faith, but craved more. Note<br>
 present imperative here <b><i>(continuous help)</i></b> \bo&#275;thei\, while aorist<br>
 imperative <b><i>(instant help)</i></b> \bo&#275;th&#275;son\, verse <!-#-->22. The word comes<br>
 from \bo&#275;\, a cry and \the&#333;\, to run, to run at a cry for help, a<br>
 vivid picture of this father's plight.<br>
 <br>
 9:25 <B>{A multitude came running together}</B> <b><i>(\episuntrechei<br>
 ochlos\)</i></b>. A double compound here alone in the N.T. and not in the<br>
 old Greek writers. \Epitrech&#333;\ occurs in the papyri, but not<br>
 \episuntrech&#333;\. The double compound vividly describes the rapid<br>
 gathering of the crowd to Jesus and the epileptic boy to see the<br>
 outcome. <B>{Come out of him}</B> <b><i>(\exelthe ex autou\)</i></b>. Jesus addresses<br>
 the demon as a separate being from the boy as he often does. This<br>
 makes it difficult to believe that Jesus was merely indulging<br>
 popular belief in a superstition. He evidently regards the demon<br>
 as the cause in this case of the boy's misfortune.<br>
 <br>
 9:26 <B>{Having torn much}</B> <b><i>(\sparaxas\)</i></b>. The uncompounded verb used<br>
 in verse <!-#-->20. <B>{Became as one dead}</B> <b><i>(\egeneto h&#333;sei nekros\)</i></b>. As<br>
 if dead from the violence of the spasm. The demon did him all<br>
 possible harm in leaving him.<br>
 <br>
 9:28 <B>{Privately, saying}</B> <b><i>(\kat' idian hoti\)</i></b>. Indoors the nine<br>
 disciples seek an explanation for their colossal failure. They<br>
 had cast out demons and wrought cures before. The Revisers are<br>
 here puzzled over Mark's use of \hoti\ as an interrogative<br>
 particle meaning <B>{why}</B> where <!-#-->Mt 17:19 has \dia ti\. Some of the<br>
 manuscripts have \dia ti\ here in <!-#-->Mr 9:28 as all do in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 17:19. See also <!-#-->Mr 2:16 and <!-#-->9:11. It is probable that in<br>
 these examples \hoti\ really means <B>{why}</B>. See Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 730. The use of \hos\ as interrogative "is by no<br>
 means rare in the late Greek" <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient<br>
 East_, p. 126)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:29 <B>{Save by prayer}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275; en proseuch&#275;i\)</i></b>. The addition of<br>
 "and of fasting" does not appear in the two best Greek<br>
 manuscripts <b><i>(Aleph and B)</i></b>. It is clearly a late addition to help<br>
 explain the failure. But it is needless and also untrue. Prayer<br>
 is what the nine had failed to use. They were powerless because<br>
 they were prayerless. Their self-complacency spelled defeat. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 17:20 has "because of your little faith" <b><i>(\oligopistian\)</i></b>. That<br>
 is true also. They had too much faith in themselves, too little<br>
 in Christ. "They had trusted to the semi-magical power with which<br>
 they thought themselves invested" <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. "Spirits of such<br>
 malignity were quick to discern the lack of moral power and would<br>
 yield to no other" <b><i>(_ibid_.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:30 <B>{He would not that any man should know it}</B> <b><i>(\ouk &#275;thelen<br>
 hina tis gnoi\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense followed by ingressive aorist<br>
 subjunctive <b><i>(\gnoi = gn&#333;i\, the usual form)</i></b>. He was not willing<br>
 that any one should learn it. Back in Galilee Jesus was, but he<br>
 was avoiding public work there now <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->7:24)</i></b>. He was no longer<br>
 the hero of Galilee. He had left Caesarea Philippi for Galilee.<br>
 <br>
 9:31 <B>{For he taught}</B> <b><i>(\edidasken gar\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense, and the<br>
 reason given for secrecy. He was renewing again definitely the<br>
 prediction of his death in Jerusalem some six months ahead as he<br>
 had done before <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 8:31; Mt 16:21; Lu 9:22)</i></b>. Now as then Jesus<br>
 foretells his resurrection "after three days" <b><i>("the third day,"<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 17:23)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:32 <B>{But they understood not the saying}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de &#275;gnooun to<br>
 rh&#275;ma\)</i></b>. An old word. Chiefly in Paul's Epistles in the N.T.<br>
 Imperfect tense. They continued not to understand. They were<br>
 agnostics on the subject of the death and resurrection even after<br>
 the Transfiguration experience. As they came down from the<br>
 mountain they were puzzled again over the Master's allusion to<br>
 his resurrection <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 9:10)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 17:23 notes that "they were<br>
 exceeding sorry" to hear Jesus talk this way again, but Mark adds<br>
 that they "were afraid to ask him" <b><i>(\ephobounto auton<br>
 eper&#333;t&#275;sai\)</i></b>. Continued to be afraid <b><i>(imperfect tense)</i></b>, perhaps<br>
 with a bitter memory of the term "Satan" hurled at Peter when he<br>
 protested the other time when Jesus spoke of his death <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 8:33;<br>
 Mt 16:23)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu 9:45 explains that "it was concealed from them,"<br>
 probably partly by their own preconceived ideas and prejudices.<br>
 <br>
 9:33 <B>{In the house}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i oiki&#257;i\)</i></b>. Probably Peter's house in<br>
 Capernaum which was the home of Jesus when in the city. <B>{What<br>
 were ye reasoning in the way?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti en t&#275;i hod&#333;i<br>
 dielogiszethe;\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense. They had been disputing <b><i>(verse<br>
 <!-#-->34)</i></b>, not about the coming death of the Master, but about the<br>
 relative rank of each of them in the political kingdom which they<br>
 were expecting him to establish. Jesus had suspected the truth<br>
 about them and they had apparently kept it up in the house. See<br>
 on &#175;Mt 18:1 where the disciples are represented as bringing the<br>
 dispute to Jesus while here Jesus asks them about it. Probably<br>
 they asked Jesus first and then he pushed the matter further and<br>
 deeper to see if this had not been the occasion of the somewhat<br>
 heated discussion on the way in.<br>
 <br>
 9:34 <B>{But they held their peace}</B> <b><i>(\Hoi de esi&#333;p&#333;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 tense. Put thus to them, they felt ashamed that the Master had<br>
 discovered their jealous rivalry. It was not a mere abstract<br>
 query, as they put it to Jesus, but it was a canker in their<br>
 hearts.<br>
 <br>
 9:35 <B>{He sat down and called the twelve}</B> <b><i>(\kathisas eph&#333;n&#275;sen<br>
 tous d&#333;deka\)</i></b>. Deliberate action of Jesus to handle this delicate<br>
 situation. Jesus gives them the rule of greatness: "If any man<br>
 would be first <b><i>(\pr&#333;tos\)</i></b> he shall be last <b><i>(\eschatos\)</i></b> of all,<br>
 and minister <b><i>(\diakonos\)</i></b> of all." This saying of Christ, like<br>
 many others, he repeated at other times <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 10:43f.; Mt 23:8ff.;<br>
 Lu 22:24f.)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 18:2 says that he called a little child, one<br>
 there in the house, perhaps Peter's child. <!-#-->Lu 9:47 notes that<br>
 he "set him by his side." Then Jesus <B>{taking him in his arms}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\enagkalisamenos\, aorist middle participle, late Greek word<br>
 from \agkal&#275;\ as in <!-#-->Lu 2:28)</i></b> spoke again to the disciples.<br>
 <br>
 9:37 <B>{One of such little children}</B> <b><i>(\hen t&#333;n toiout&#333;n paidi&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 18:5 has "one such little child" and <!-#-->Lu 9:48 "this little<br>
 child." It was an object lesson to the arrogant conceit of the<br>
 twelve apostles contending for primacy. They did not learn this<br>
 lesson for they will again wrangle over primacy <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 10:33-45; Mt<br>
 20:20-28)</i></b> and they will be unable to comprehend easily what the<br>
 attitude of Jesus was toward children <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 10:13-16; Mt 19:13-15;<br>
 Lu 8:15-17)</i></b>. The child was used as a rebuke to the apostles.<br>
 <br>
 9:38 <B>{Because he followed not us}</B> <b><i>(\hoti ouk &#275;kolouthei h&#275;min\)</i></b>.<br>
 Note vivid imperfect tense again. John evidently thought to<br>
 change the subject from the constraint and embarrassment caused<br>
 by their dispute. So he told about a case of extra zeal on his<br>
 part expecting praise from Jesus. Perhaps what Jesus had just<br>
 said in verse <!-#-->37 raised a doubt in John's mind as to the<br>
 propriety of his excessive narrowness. One needs to know the<br>
 difference between loyalty to Jesus and stickling over one's own<br>
 narrow prejudices.<br>
 <br>
 9:39 <B>{Forbid him not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; k&#333;luete\)</i></b>. Stop hindering him <b><i>(\m&#275;\<br>
 and the present-imperative)</i></b> as John had been doing.<br>
 <br>
 9:40 <B>{He that is not against us is with us}</B> <b><i>(\hos ouk estin kath'<br>
 h&#275;m&#333;n huper h&#275;m&#333;n estin\)</i></b>. This profound saying throws a flood of<br>
 light in every direction. The complement of this logion is that<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 12:30: "He that is not with me is against me." Both are<br>
 needed. Some people imagine that they are really for Christ who<br>
 refuse to take a stand in the open with him and for him.<br>
 <br>
 9:41 <B>{Because ye are Christ's}</B> <b><i>(\hoti Christou este\)</i></b>. Predicate<br>
 genitive, belong to Christ. See <!-#-->Ro 8:9; 1Co 1:12; 2Co 10:7.<br>
 That is the bond of universal brotherhood of the redeemed. It<br>
 breaks over the lines of nation, race, class, sex, everything. No<br>
 service is too small, even a cup of cold water, if done for<br>
 Christ's sake. See on &#175;Mt 18:6f. for discussion on<br>
 stumbling-blocks for these little ones that believe on Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 9:42)</i></b>, a loving term of all believers, not just children.<br>
 <br>
 9:43 <B>{Into hell, into the unquenchable fire}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n geennan,<br>
 eis to p&#8211;r to asbeston\)</i></b>. Not Hades, but Gehenna. \Asbeston\ is<br>
 alpha privative and \sbestos\ from \sbennumi\ to quench. It<br>
 occurs often in Homer. Our word asbestos is this very word. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 18:8 has "into the eternal fire." The Valley of Hinnom had been<br>
 desecrated by the sacrifice of children to Moloch so that as an<br>
 accursed place it was used for the city garbage where worms<br>
 gnawed and fires burned. It is thus a vivid picture of eternal<br>
 punishment.<br>
 <br>
 9:44 The oldest and best manuscripts do not give these two<br>
 verses. They came in from the Western and Syrian <b><i>(Byzantine)</i></b><br>
 classes. They are a mere repetition of verse <!-#-->48. Hence we lose<br>
 the numbering 44 and 46 in our verses which are not genuine.<br>
 <br>
 9:46 See on &#175;44<br>
 <br>
 9:47 <B>{With one eye}</B> <b><i>(\monophthalmon\)</i></b>. Literally one-eyed. See<br>
 also <!-#-->Mt 18:9. Vernacular _Koin&#275;_ and condemned by the<br>
 Atticists. See <!-#-->Mt 18:8f. Mark has here "kingdom of God" where<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 18:9 has "life."<br>
 <br>
 9:48 <B>{Their worm}</B> <b><i>(\ho sk&#333;l&#275;x aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. "The worm, i.e. that preys<br>
 upon the inhabitants of this dread realm" <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>. Two bold<br>
 figures of Gehenna combined <b><i>(the gnawing worm, the burning<br>
 flame)</i></b>. No figures of Gehenna can equal the dread reality which<br>
 is here described. See <!-#-->Isa 66:24.<br>
 <br>
 9:50 <B>{Have salt in yourselves}</B> <b><i>(\echete en heautois hala\)</i></b>. Jesus<br>
 had once called them the salt of the earth <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:13)</i></b> and had<br>
 warned them against losing the saltness of the salt. If it is<br>
 \analon\, nothing can <B>{season}</B> <b><i>(\artu&#333;\)</i></b> it and it is of no use<br>
 to season anything else. It is like an exploded shell, a<br>
 burnt-out crater, a spent force. This is a warning for all<br>
 Christians.<br>
