<p>16:1 <B>{And he came also to Derbe and Lystra}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;nt&#275;sen de kai<br>
 eis Derb&#275;n kai eis Lustran\)</i></b>. First aorist active of \katanta&#333;\,<br>
 late verb to come down to, to arrive at. He struck Derbe first of<br>
 the places in the first tour which was the last city reached<br>
 then. <B>{Timothy}</B> <b><i>(\Timotheos\)</i></b>. Apparently a native of Lystra<br>
 <b><i>("there," \ekei\)</i></b>, his Hebrew mother named Eunice and grandmother<br>
 Lois <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 1:5)</i></b> and his Greek father's name not known. He may<br>
 have been a proselyte, but not necessarily so as Timothy was<br>
 taught the Scriptures by his mother and grandmother <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 3:15)</i></b>,<br>
 and, if a proselyte, he would have had Timothy circumcised. It is<br>
 idle to ask if Paul came on purpose to get Timothy to take Mark's<br>
 place. Probably Timothy was about eighteen years of age, a<br>
 convert of Paul's former visit a few years before <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 1:2)</i></b> and<br>
 still young twelve years later <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 4:12)</i></b>. Paul loved him<br>
 devotedly <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 1:3; 5:23; 2Ti 3:15; Php 2:19f.)</i></b>. It is a<br>
 glorious discovery to find a real young preacher for Christ's<br>
 work.<br>
 <br>
 16:2 <B>{Was well reported of}</B> <b><i>(\emartureito\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive.<br>
 It was a continuous witness that was borne the young disciple<br>
 both in his home town of Lystra and in Derbe. Already he had so<br>
 borne himself that his gifts and graces for the ministry were<br>
 recognized. It is a wise precaution that the approval of the<br>
 local church is necessary for the licensing and the ordaining of<br>
 a preacher. If God has called a man for the work signs of it will<br>
 be manifest to others.<br>
 <br>
 16:3 <B>{Him would Paul have to go forth with him}</B> <b><i>(\touton<br>
 &#275;thel&#275;sen ho Paulos sun aut&#333;i exelthein\)</i></b>. This one <b><i>(note<br>
 emphatic position)</i></b> Paul wanted <b><i>(first aorist active indicative of<br>
 \thel&#333;\ with temporal augment as if from \ethel&#333;\ the old form)</i></b>.<br>
 Here was a gifted young man who was both Jew and Greek. <B>{He took<br>
 and circumcised him}</B> <b><i>(\lab&#333;n perietemen auton\)</i></b>. Any one could<br>
 perform this rite. Paul had stoutly resisted circumcision in the<br>
 case of Titus, a pure Greek <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 2:3,5)</i></b>, because the whole<br>
 principle of Gentile liberty was at stake. But Timothy was both<br>
 Jew and Greek and would continually give offence to the Jews with<br>
 no advantage to the cause of Gentile freedom. So here for the<br>
 sake of expediency, "because of the Jews" <b><i>(\dia tous Ioudaious\)</i></b>,<br>
 Paul voluntarily removed this stumbling-block to the ministry of<br>
 Timothy. Otherwise Timothy could not have been allowed to preach<br>
 ln the synagogues. _Idem non est semper idem_. But Timothy's case<br>
 was not the case of Titus. Here it was a question of efficient<br>
 service, not an essential of salvation. Hovey notes that Timothy<br>
 was circumcised because of Jewish unbelievers, not because of<br>
 Jewish believers. <B>{Was a Greek}</B> <b><i>(\Hell&#275;n hup&#275;rchen\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active in indirect assertion where ordinarily the present<br>
 \huparchei\ would be retained, possibly indicating that his<br>
 father was no longer living.<br>
 <br>
 16:4 <B>{They delivered them}</B> <b><i>(\paredidosan autois\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active, kept on delivering to them in city after city. This is a<br>
 proof of Paul's loyalty to the Jerusalem compact <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. The<br>
 circumcision of Timothy would indicate also that the points<br>
 involved were under discussion and that Paul felt no<br>
 inconsistency in what he did. <B>{The decrees}</B> <b><i>(\ta dogmata\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 word from \doke&#333;\, to give an opinion. It is used of public<br>
 decrees of rulers <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:1; Ac 17:7)</i></b>, of the requirements of the<br>
 Mosaic law <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 2:14)</i></b>, and here of the regulations or<br>
 conclusions of the Jerusalem Conference. Silas was with Paul and<br>
 his presence gave added dignity to the passing out of the<br>
 decrees, a charter of Gentile freedom, since he was one of the<br>
 committee from Jerusalem to Antioch <b><i>(<!-#-->15:22,27,32)</i></b>. <B>{Which had<br>
 been ordained}</B> <b><i>(\ta kekrimena\)</i></b>. Perfect passive articular<br>
 participle of \krin&#333;\, to judge, emphasizing the permanence of<br>
 the conclusions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.<br>
 <B>{For to keep}</B> <b><i>(\phulassein\)</i></b>. This present active infinitive<br>
 likewise accents that it is a charter of liberty for continual<br>
 living, not a temporary compromise.<br>
 <br>
 16:5 <B>{Were strengthened}</B> <b><i>(\estereounto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive of<br>
 \stereo&#333;\, old verb to make firm and solid like the muscles <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 3:7,16)</i></b>, these three the only examples in the N.T. <B>{Increased}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eperisseuon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of the old and common verb<br>
 \perisseu&#333;\ from \perissos\ <b><i>(overplus)</i></b>. The blessing of God was<br>
 on the work of Paul, Silas, and Timothy in the form of a<br>
 continuous revival.<br>
 <br>
 16:6 <B>{The region of Phrygia and Galatia}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n Phrugian kai<br>
 Galatik&#275;n ch&#333;ran\)</i></b>. This is probably the correct text with one<br>
 article and apparently describes one "Region" or District in The<br>
 Province of Galatia which was also Phrygian <b><i>(the old-ethnographic<br>
 name with which compare the use of Lycaonia in <!-#-->14:6)</i></b>. Strictly<br>
 speaking Derbe and Lystra, though in the Province of Galatia,<br>
 were not Phrygian, and so Luke would here be not resumptive of<br>
 the record in verses <!-#-->1-5; but a reference to the country around<br>
 Iconium and Antioch in Pisidia in North Galatia is not included.<br>
 This verse is hotly disputed at every point by the advocates of<br>
 the North Galatian theory as represented by Chase and the South<br>
 Galatian theory by Ramsay. Whatever is true in regard to the<br>
 language of Luke here and in <!-#-->18:23, it is still possible for<br>
 Paul in <!-#-->Ga 1:2 to use the term Galatia of the whole province of<br>
 that name which could, in fact, apply to either South or North<br>
 Galatia or to both. He could, of course, use it also in the<br>
 ethnographic sense of the real Gauls or Celts who dwelt in North<br>
 Galatia. Certainly the first tour of Paul and Barnabas was in the<br>
 Province of Galatia though touching only the Regions of Pisidia,<br>
 Phrygia, and Lycaonia, which province included besides the Gauls<br>
 to the north. In this second tour Lycaonia has been already<br>
 touched <b><i>(Derbe and Lystra)</i></b> and now Phrygia. The question arises<br>
 why Luke here and in <!-#-->18:23 adds the term "of Galatia"<br>
 <b><i>(\Galatik&#275;n\)</i></b> though not in <!-#-->13:14 <b><i>(Pisidian Antioch)</i></b> nor in<br>
 <!-#-->14:6 <b><i>(cities of Lycaonia)</i></b>. Does Luke mean to use "of Galatia"<br>
 in the same ethnographic sense as "of Phrygia" or does he here<br>
 add the province <b><i>(Galatia)</i></b> to the name of the Region <b><i>(Phrygia)</i></b>?<br>
 In itself either view is possible and it really matters very<br>
 little except that the question is raised whether Paul went into<br>
 the North Galatian Region on this occasion or later <b><i>(<!-#-->18:23)</i></b>. He<br>
 could have done so and the Epistle be addressed to the churches<br>
 of South Galatia, North Galatia, or the province as a whole. But<br>
 the Greek participle \k&#333;luthentes\ <b><i>("having been forbidden")</i></b><br>
 plays a part in the argument that cannot be overlooked whether<br>
 Luke means to say that Paul went north or not. This aorist<br>
 passive participle of \k&#333;lu&#333;\, to hinder, can only express<br>
 simultaneous or antecedent action, not subsequent action as<br>
 Ramsay argues. No example of the so-called subsequent use of the<br>
 aorist participle has ever been found in Greek as all Greek<br>
 grammarians agree <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 860-63, 1112-14)</i></b>.<br>
 The only natural meaning of \k&#333;luthentes\ is that Paul with Silas<br>
 and Timothy "passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia"<br>
 because they were hindered by the Holy Spirit from speaking the<br>
 word in Asia <b><i>(the Province of Asia of which Ephesus was the chief<br>
 city and west of Derbe and Lystra)</i></b>. This construction implies<br>
 that the country called "the region of Phrygia and Galatia" is<br>
 not in the direct line west toward Ephesus. What follows in verse<br>
 <!-#-->7 throws further light on the point.<br>
 <br>
 16:7 <B>{Over against Mysia}</B> <b><i>(\kata t&#275;n Musian\)</i></b>. This was an<br>
 ill-defined region rather north and west of Phrygia. The Romans<br>
 finally absorbed most of it in the Province of Asia. <B>{They<br>
 assayed to go into Bithynia}</B> <b><i>(\epeirazon eis t&#275;n Bithunian<br>
 poreuth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. Conative imperfect of \peiraz&#333;\ and ingressive<br>
 aorist passive infinitive of \poreuomai\. Now Bithynia is<br>
 northeast of Mysia and north of Galatia <b><i>(province)</i></b>. Clearly Luke<br>
 means to say that Paul had, when hindered by the Holy Spirit from<br>
 going west into Asia, gone north so as to come in front of<br>
 Bithynia. This journey would take him directly through Phrygia<br>
 and the North Galatian country <b><i>(the real Gauls or Celts)</i></b>. This<br>
 is, to my mind, the strongest argument for the North Galatian<br>
 view in these verses <!-#-->6,7. The grammar and the topography bring<br>
 Paul right up to Bithynia <b><i>(north of the old Galatia)</i></b>. It is<br>
 verses <!-#-->6,7 that make me pause before accepting the plausible<br>
 arguments of Ramsay for the South Galatian theory. In itself the<br>
 problem is nothing like so important or so determinative as he<br>
 makes it. But shall we smash Luke's grammar to pieces to bolster<br>
 up a theory of criticism? <B>{And the Spirit of Jesus suffered them<br>
 not}</B> <b><i>(\kai ouk eiasen autous to pneuma I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. The same Spirit<br>
 who in verse <!-#-->6 had forbidden going into Asia now closed the<br>
 door into Bithynia. This expression occurs nowhere else, but we<br>
 have the spirit of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 8:9)</i></b> and the Spirit of Jesus<br>
 Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 1:19)</i></b>. \Eiasen\ is first aorist active indicative<br>
 of \ea&#333;\, old verb to allow.<br>
 <br>
 16:8 <B>{Passing by Mysia}</B> <b><i>(\parelthontes t&#275;n Musian\)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 passing alongside or skirting Mysia, neglecting it without<br>
 preaching there. Strictly they passed through part of it to reach<br>
 Troas. <B>{To Troas}</B> <b><i>(\eis Troiada\)</i></b>. This city, named Alexandria<br>
 Troas after Alexander the Great, was the seaport of Mysia, though<br>
 a Roman colony and not counted as part of either Asia or<br>
 Bithynia. New Ilium, on the site of the old Troy, was four miles<br>
 farther north. It was the place to take ship for Philippi. Twice<br>
 again Paul will be here <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 2:12; Ac 20:6)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:9 <B>{A vision}</B> <b><i>(\horama\)</i></b>. Old word, eleven times in Acts, once<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 17:9. Twice Paul had been hindered by the Holy Spirit<br>
 from going where he wanted to go. Most men would have gone back<br>
 home with such rebuffs, but not so Paul. Now the call is positive<br>
 and not negative, to go "far hence to the Gentiles" <b><i>(<!-#-->22:21)</i></b>. He<br>
 had little dreamed of such a call when he left Antioch. Paul's<br>
 frequent visions always came at real crises in his life. <B>{A man<br>
 of Macedonia}</B> <b><i>(\an&#275;r Maked&#333;n\)</i></b>. Ramsay follows Renan in the view<br>
 that this was Luke with whom Paul had conversed about conditions<br>
 in Macedonia. Verse <!-#-->10 makes it plain that Luke was now in the<br>
 party, but when he joined them we do not know. Some hold that<br>
 Luke lived at Antioch in Syria and came on with Paul and Silas,<br>
 others that he joined them later in Galatia, others that he<br>
 appeared now either as Paul's physician or new convert. Ramsay<br>
 thinks that Philippi was his home at this time. But, whatever is<br>
 true about Luke, the narrative must not be robbed of its<br>
 supernatural aspect <b><i>(<!-#-->10:10; 22:17)</i></b>. <B>{Was standing}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n<br>
 hest&#333;s\)</i></b>. Second perfect active participle of \hist&#275;mi\,<br>
 intransitive, periphrastic imperfect. Vivid picture. <B>{Help us}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\bo&#275;th&#275;son h&#275;min\)</i></b>. Ingressive first aorist active imperative of<br>
 \bo&#275;the&#333;\ <b><i>(\bo&#275;, the&#333;\)</i></b>, to run at a cry, to help. The man uses<br>
 the plural for all including himself. It was the cry of Europe<br>
 for Christ.<br>
 <br>
 16:10 <B>{We sought}</B> <b><i>(\ez&#275;t&#275;samen\)</i></b>. This sudden use of the plural,<br>
 dropped in <!-#-->17:1 when Paul leaves Philippi, and resumed in<br>
 <!-#-->20:5 when Paul rejoins Luke in Philippi, argues conclusively<br>
 that Luke, the author, is in the party <b><i>("we" portions of Acts)</i></b><br>
 and shows in a writer of such literary skill as Luke that he is<br>
 not copying a document in a blundering sort of way. Paul told his<br>
 vision to the party and they were all ready to respond to the<br>
 call. <B>{Concluding}</B> <b><i>(\sunbibazontes\)</i></b>. A very striking word,<br>
 present active participle of \sunbibaz&#333;\, old verb to make go<br>
 together, to coalesce or knit together, to make this and that<br>
 agree and so to conclude. Already in <!-#-->9:22 of Paul's preaching.<br>
 This word here gives a good illustration of the proper use of the<br>
 reason in connection with revelation, to decide whether it is a<br>
 revelation from God, to find out what it means for us, and to see<br>
 that we obey the revelation when understood. God had called them<br>
 to preach to the Macedonians. They had to go.<br>
 <br>
 16:11 <B>{Setting sail}</B> <b><i>(\anachthentes\)</i></b>. Same word in <!-#-->13:13 which<br>
 see. <B>{We made a straight course}</B> <b><i>(\euthudrom&#275;samen\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active indicative of compound verb \euthudrome&#333;\ <b><i>(in<br>
 Philo)</i></b> from adjective \euthudromos\ <b><i>(in Strabo)</i></b>, running a<br>
 straight course <b><i>(\euthus, dromos\)</i></b>. In the N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->21:1. It is a nautical term for sailing before the wind. Luke<br>
 has a true feeling for the sea. <B>{To Samothrace}</B> <b><i>(\eis<br>
 Samothr&#257;ik&#275;n\)</i></b>. A small island in the Aegean about halfway<br>
 between Troas and Neapolis. <B>{The day following}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i epious&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Locative case of time with \h&#275;mer&#257;i\ <b><i>(day)</i></b> to be supplied <b><i>(<!-#-->7:26;<br>
 20:15; 21:18; 23:11)</i></b>. With adverse winds it took five days to<br>
 make the run of 125 miles <b><i>(<!-#-->20:6)</i></b>. <B>{To Neapolis}</B> <b><i>(\eis Nean<br>
 Polin\)</i></b>. To New Town <b><i>(Newton, Naples, Neapolis)</i></b>. The port of<br>
 Philippi ten miles distant, Thracian, but reckoned as Macedonian<br>
 after Vespasian.<br>
 <br>
 16:12 <B>{To Philippi}</B> <b><i>(\eis Philippous\)</i></b>. The plural like \Ath&#275;nai\<br>
 <b><i>(Athens)</i></b> is probably due to separate sections of the city united<br>
 <b><i>(Winer-Moulton, _Grammar_, p. 220)</i></b>. The city <b><i>(ancient name<br>
 Krenides or Wells)</i></b> was renamed after himself by Philip, the<br>
 father of Alexander the Great. It was situated about a mile east<br>
 of the small stream Gangites which flows into the river Strymon<br>
 some thirty miles away. In this valley the Battle of Philippi was<br>
 fought B.C. 42 between the Second Triumvirate <b><i>(Octavius,<br>
 Antonius, Lepidus)</i></b> and Brutus and Cassius. In memory of the<br>
 victory Octavius made it a colony <b><i>(\kol&#333;nia\)</i></b> with all the<br>
 privileges of Roman citizenship, such as freedom from scourging,<br>
 freedom from arrest save in extreme cases, and the right of<br>
 appeal to the emperor. This Latin word occurs here alone in the<br>
 N.T. Octavius planted here a colony of Roman veterans with farms<br>
 attached, a military outpost and a miniature of Rome itself. The<br>
 language was Latin. Here Paul is face to face with the Roman<br>
 power and empire in a new sense. He was a new Alexander, come<br>
 from Asia to conquer Europe for Christ, a new Caesar to build the<br>
 Kingdom of Christ on the work of Alexander and Caesar. One need<br>
 not think that Paul was conscious of all that was involved in<br>
 destiny for the world. Philippi was on the Egnatian Way, one of<br>
 the great Roman roads, that ran from here to Dyrrachium on the<br>
 shores of the Adriatic, a road that linked the east with the<br>
 west. <B>{The first of the district}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;t&#275; t&#275;s meridos\)</i></b>. Philippi<br>
 was not the first city of Macedonia nor does Luke say so. That<br>
 honour belonged to Thessalonica and even Amphipolis was larger<br>
 than Philippi. It is not clear whether by \meris\ Luke means a<br>
 formal division of the province, though the _Koin&#275;_ has examples<br>
 of this geographical sense <b><i>(papyri)</i></b>. There is no article with<br>
 \pr&#333;t&#275;\ and Luke may not mean to stress unduly the position of<br>
 Philippi in comparison with Amphipolis. But it was certainly a<br>
 leading city of this district of Macedonia. <B>{We were tarrying}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;men diatribontes\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect active.<br>
 <br>
 16:13 <B>{By a river side}</B> <b><i>(\para potamon\)</i></b>. The little river<br>
 Gangites <b><i>(or Gargites)</i></b> was one mile west of the town. Philippi as<br>
 a military outpost had few Jews. There was evidently no synagogue<br>
 inside the city, but "without the gates" <b><i>(\ex&#333; t&#275;s pul&#275;s\)</i></b> they<br>
 had noticed an enclosure "where we supposed" <b><i>(\hou enomizomen\,<br>
 correct text, imperfect active)</i></b>, probably as they came into the<br>
 city, "was a place of prayer" <b><i>(\proscuch&#275;n einai\)</i></b>. Infinitive<br>
 with accusative of general reference in indirect discourse.<br>
 \Proseuch&#275;\ is common in the LXX and the N.T. for the act of<br>
 prayer as in <!-#-->Ac 2:42 then for a place of prayer either a<br>
 synagogue <b><i>(III Macc. 7:20)</i></b> or more often an open air enclosure<br>
 near the sea or a river where there was water for ceremonial<br>
 ablutions. The word occurs also in heathen writers for a place of<br>
 prayer <b><i>(Schurer, _Jewish People_, Div. II, Vol. II, p. 69, Engl.<br>
 Tr.)</i></b>. Deissmann <b><i>(_Bible Studies_, p. 222)</i></b> quotes an Egyptian<br>
 inscription of the third century B.C. with this sense of the word<br>
 and one from Panticapaeum on the Black Sea of the first century<br>
 A.D. <b><i>(_Light from the Ancient East_, p. 102)</i></b>. Juvenal <b><i>(III. 296)</i></b><br>
 has a sneering reference to the Jewish \proseucha\. Josephus<br>
 <b><i>(_Ant_. XIV. 10, 23)</i></b> quotes a decree of Halicarnassus which<br>
 allowed the Jews "to make their prayers <b><i>(\proseuchas\)</i></b> on the<br>
 seashore according to the custom of their fathers." There was a<br>
 synagogue in Thessalonica, but apparently none in Amphipolis and<br>
 Apollonia <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 17:1)</i></b>. The rule of the rabbis required ten men to<br>
 constitute a synagogue, but here were gathered only a group of<br>
 women at the hour of prayer. In pioneer days in this country it<br>
 was a common thing to preach under bush arbours in the open air.<br>
 John Wesley and George Whitfield were great open air preachers.<br>
 Paul did not have an inspiring beginning for his work in Europe,<br>
 but he took hold where he could. The conjecture was correct. It<br>
 was a place of prayer, but only a bunch of women had come<br>
 together <b><i>(\tais sunelthousais gunaixin\)</i></b>, excuse enough for not<br>
 preaching to some preachers, but not to Paul and his party. The<br>
 "man of Macedonia" turned out to be a group of women <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
 Macedonian inscriptions show greater freedom for women in<br>
 Macedonia than elsewhere at this time and confirm Luke's story of<br>
 the activities of women in Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea. <B>{We sat<br>
 down and spake}</B> <b><i>(\kathisantes elaloumen\)</i></b>. Having taken our seats<br>
 <b><i>(aorist active participle of \kathiz&#333;\)</i></b> we began to speak or<br>
 preach <b><i>(inchoative imperfect of \lale&#333;\, often used for<br>
 preaching)</i></b>. Sitting was the Jewish attitude for public speaking.<br>
 It was not mere conversation, but more likely conversational<br>
 preaching of an historical and expository character. Luke's use<br>
 of the first person plural implies that each of the four <b><i>(Paul,<br>
 Silas, Timothy, Luke)</i></b> preached in turn, with Paul as chief<br>
 speaker.<br>
 <br>
 16:14 <B>{Lydia}</B> <b><i>(\Ludia\)</i></b>. Her birthplace was Thyatira in Lydia.<br>
 She may have been named after the land, though Lydia is a common<br>
 female name <b><i>(see Horace)</i></b>. Lydia was itself a Macedonian colony<br>
 <b><i>(Strabo, XIII. 4)</i></b>. Thyatira <b><i>(note plural form like Philippi and<br>
 one of the seven churches of Asia here <!-#-->Re 2:18)</i></b> was famous for<br>
 its purple dyes as old as Homer <b><i>(Iliad, IV. 141)</i></b> and had a guild<br>
 of dyers <b><i>(\hoi bapheis\)</i></b> as inscriptions show. <B>{A seller of<br>
 purple}</B> <b><i>(\porphurop&#333;lis\)</i></b>. A female seller of purple fabrics<br>
 <b><i>(\porphura, p&#333;lis\)</i></b>. Late word, masculine form in an inscription.<br>
 There was a great demand for this fabric as it was used on the<br>
 official toga at Rome and in Roman colonies. We still use the<br>
 term "royal purple." See on &#175;Lu 16:19. Evidently Lydia was a<br>
 woman of some means to carry on such an important enterprise from<br>
 her native city. She may have been a freed-woman, since racial<br>
 names were often borne by slaves. <B>{One that worshipped God}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sebomen&#275; ton theon\)</i></b>. A God-fearer or proselyte of the gate.<br>
 There was a Jewish settlement in Thyatira which was especially<br>
 interested in the dyeing industry. She probably became a<br>
 proselyte there. Whether this was true of the other women we do<br>
 not know. They may have been Jewesses or proselytes like Lydia,<br>
 probably all of them employees of hers in her business. When Paul<br>
 writes to the Philippians he does not mention Lydia who may have<br>
 died meanwhile and who certainly was not Paul's wife. She was<br>
 wealthy and probably a widow. <B>{Heard us}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kouen\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active of \akou&#333;\, was listening, really listening and she kept<br>
 it up, listening to each of these new and strange preachers.<br>
 <B>{Opened}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;noixen\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of<br>
 \dianoig&#333;\, old word, double compound <b><i>(\dia, ana, oig&#333;\)</i></b> to open<br>
 up wide or completely like a folding door <b><i>(both sides, \dia\,<br>
 two)</i></b>. Only the Lord could do that. Jesus had opened <b><i>(the same<br>
 verb)</i></b> the mind of the disciples to understand the Scriptures <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 24:45)</i></b>. <B>{To give heed}</B> <b><i>(\prosechein\)</i></b>. To hold the mind <b><i>(\ton<br>
 noun\ understood)</i></b>, present active infinitive. She kept her mind<br>
 centred on the things spoken by Paul whose words gripped her<br>
 attention. She rightly perceived that Paul was the foremost one<br>
 of the group. He had personal magnetism and power of intellect<br>
 that the Spirit of God used to win the heart of this remarkable<br>
 woman to Christ. It was worth coming to Philippi to win this fine<br>
 personality to the Kingdom of God. She will be the chief spirit<br>
 in this church that will give Paul more joy and co-operation than<br>
 any of his churches. It is not stated that she was converted on<br>
 the first Sabbath, though this may have been the case. "One<br>
 solitary convert, a woman, and she already a seeker after God,<br>
 and a native of that very Asia where they had been forbidden to<br>
 preach" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. But a new era had dawned for Europe and for<br>
 women in the conversion of Lydia.<br>
 <br>
 16:15 <B>{And when she was baptized}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s de ebaptisth&#275;\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive indicative of \baptiz&#333;\. The river Gangites was<br>
 handy for the ordinance and she had now been converted and was<br>
 ready to make this public declaration of her faith in Jesus<br>
 Christ. <B>{And her household}</B> <b><i>(\kai ho oikos aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Who<br>
 constituted her "household"? The term \oikos\, originally means<br>
 the building as below, "into my house" and then it includes the<br>
 inmates of a house. There is nothing here to show whether Lydia's<br>
 "household" went beyond "the women" employed by her who like her<br>
 had heard the preaching of Paul and had believed. "Possibly<br>
 Euodia and Syntyche and the other women, <!-#-->Php 4:2,3, may have<br>
 been included in the family of Lydia, who may have employed many<br>
 slaves and freed women in her trade" <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. "This statement<br>
 cannot be claimed as any argument for infant baptism, since the<br>
 Greek word may mean her servants or her work-people" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
 In the household baptisms <b><i>(Cornelius, Lydia, the jailor, Crispus)</i></b><br>
 one sees "infants" or not according to his predilections or<br>
 preferences. <B>{If ye have judged me}</B> <b><i>(\ei kekrikate me\)</i></b>.<br>
 Condition of the first class, assumed to be true <b><i>(\ei\ and the<br>
 indicative, here perfect active of \krin&#333;\)</i></b>. She had confessed<br>
 her faith and submitted to baptism as proof that she was<br>
 "faithful to the Lord" <b><i>(\pist&#275;n t&#333;i kuri&#333;i\)</i></b>, believing on the<br>
 Lord. "If she was fit for that, surely she was fit to be their<br>
 hostess" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. And Paul and his party had clearly no<br>
 comfortable place to stay while in Philippi. The ancient hotels<br>
 or inns were abominable. Evidently Paul demurred for there were<br>
 four of them and he did not wish to sacrifice his independence or<br>
 be a burden even to a woman of wealth. <B>{And she constrained us}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai parebiasato h&#275;mas\)</i></b>. Effective first aorist middle of<br>
 \parabiazomai\, late word, in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 24:29.<br>
 Some moral force <b><i>(\bia\)</i></b> or hospitable persuasion was required<br>
 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1Sa 28:23)</i></b>, but Lydia had her way as women usually do. So<br>
 he accepted Lydia's hospitality in Philippi, though he worked for<br>
 his own living in Thessalonica <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 3:8)</i></b> and elsewhere <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co<br>
 11:9)</i></b>. So far only women have been won to Christ in Philippi.<br>
 The use of "us" shows that Luke was not a householder in<br>
 Philippi.<br>
 <br>
 16:16 <B>{A spirit of divination}</B> <b><i>(\pneuma puth&#333;na\)</i></b>. So the correct<br>
 text with accusative <b><i>(apparition, a spirit, a python)</i></b>, not the<br>
 genitive <b><i>(\puth&#333;nos\)</i></b>. Hesychius defines it as \daimonion<br>
 manikon\ <b><i>(a spirit of divination)</i></b>. The etymology of the word is<br>
 unknown. Bengel suggests \puthesthai\ from \punthanomai\, to<br>
 inquire. Python was the name given to the serpent that kept guard<br>
 at Delphi, slain by Apollo, who was called \Puthios Apollo\ and<br>
 the prophetess at Delphi was termed Pythia. Certainly Luke does<br>
 not mean to credit Apollo with a real existence <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 8:4)</i></b>. But<br>
 Plutarch <b><i>(A.D. 50-100)</i></b> says that the term \puth&#333;nes\ was applied<br>
 to ventriloquists <b><i>(\eggastrimuthoi\)</i></b>. In the LXX those with<br>
 familiar spirits are called by this word ventriloquists <b><i>(<!-#-->Le<br>
 19:31; 20:6,27, including the witch of Endor <!-#-->1Sa 28:7)</i></b>. It is<br>
 possible that this slave girl had this gift of prophecy "by<br>
 soothsaying" <b><i>(\manteuomen&#275;\)</i></b>. Present middle participle of<br>
 \manteuomai\, old heathen word <b><i>(in contrast with \proph&#275;teu&#333;\)</i></b><br>
 for acting the seer <b><i>(\mantis\)</i></b> and this kin to \mainomai\, to be<br>
 mad, like the howling dervishes of later times. This is the<br>
 so-called instrumental use of the circumstantial participles.<br>
 <B>{Brought}</B> <b><i>(\pareichen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \parech&#333;\, a steady<br>
 source of income. <B>{Much gain}</B> <b><i>(\ergasian poll&#275;n\)</i></b>. Work,<br>
 business, from \ergazomai\, to work. <B>{Her masters}</B> <b><i>(\tois kuriois<br>
 aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Dative case. Joint owners of this poor slave girl who<br>
 were exploiting her calamity, whatever it was, for selfish gain,<br>
 just as men and women today exploit girls and women in the "white<br>
 slave" trade. As a fortune-teller she was a valuable asset for<br>
 all the credulous dupes of the community. Simon Magus in Samaria<br>
 and Elymas Barjesus in Cyprus had won power and wealth as<br>
 soothsayers.<br>
 <br>
 16:17 <B>{The Most High God}</B> <b><i>(\tou theou tou hupsistou\)</i></b>. Pagan<br>
 inscriptions use this language for the Supreme Being. It looks<br>
 like supernatural testimony like that borne by the demoniacs to<br>
 Jesus as "son of the Most High God" <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:28. Cf; also <!-#-->Mr<br>
 1:24; 3:11; Mt 8:29; Lu 4:41, etc.)</i></b>. She may have heard Paul<br>
 preach about Jesus as the way of salvation. <B>{The way of<br>
 salvation}</B> <b><i>(\hodon s&#333;t&#275;rias\)</i></b>. A way of salvation, strictly<br>
 speaking <b><i>(no article)</i></b>. There were many "ways of salvation"<br>
 offered to men then as now.<br>
 <br>
 16:18 <B>{She did}</B> <b><i>(\epoiei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, kept it up for many<br>
 days. The strange conduct gave Paul and the rest an unpleasant<br>
 prominence in the community. <B>{Being sore troubled}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\diapon&#275;theis\)</i></b>. First aorist passive of \diapone&#333;\, old verb,<br>
 to work laboriously, then in passive to be "worked up,"<br>
 displeased, worn out. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->4:2 which see<br>
 <b><i>(there of the Sadducees about Peter's preaching)</i></b>. Paul was<br>
 grieved, annoyed, indignant. He wanted no testimony from a source<br>
 like this any more than he did the homage of the people of Lystra<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->14:14)</i></b>. <B>{That very hour}</B> <b><i>(\aut&#275;i t&#275;i h&#333;r&#257;i\)</i></b>. Locative case of<br>
 time and familiar Lukan idiom in his Gospel, "at the hour<br>
 itself." The cure was instantaneous. Paul, like Jesus,<br>
 distinguished between the demon and the individual.<br>
 <br>
 16:19 <B>{Was gone}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#275;lthen\)</i></b>. Was gone out of the slave girl,<br>
 second aorist active indicative of \exerchomai\. "The two most<br>
 important social revolutions worked by Christianity have been the<br>
 elevation of woman and the abolition of slavery" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. Both<br>
 are illustrated here <b><i>(Lydia and this slave girl)</i></b>. "The most<br>
 sensitive part of 'civilized' man is the pocket" <b><i>(Ramsay)</i></b>. <B>{Laid<br>
 hold on}</B> <b><i>(\epilabomenoi\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle participle of<br>
 \epilamban&#333;\ as in <!-#-->9:27; 17:19, but here with hostile intent.<br>
 <B>{Dragged}</B> <b><i>(\heilkusan\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of<br>
 \helku&#333;\, late form of the old verb \helk&#333;\ <b><i>(also in <!-#-->Jas 2:6)</i></b><br>
 to draw as a sword, and then to drag one forcibly as here and<br>
 <!-#-->21:30. It is also used of spiritual drawing as by Jesus in <!-#-->Joh<br>
 12:32. Here it is by violence. <B>{Into the marketplace}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n<br>
 agoran\)</i></b>. Into the Roman forum near which would be the courts of<br>
 law as in our courthouse square, as in <!-#-->17:17. Marketing went on<br>
 also <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 7:4)</i></b>, when the crowds collect <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 6:56)</i></b>, from<br>
 \ageir&#333;\, to collect or gather. <B>{Unto the rulers}</B> <b><i>(\epi tous<br>
 archontas\)</i></b>. General Greek term for "the magistrates."<br>
 <br>
 16:20 <B>{Unto the magistrates}</B> <b><i>(\tois strat&#275;gois\)</i></b>. Greek term<br>
 <b><i>(\stratos, ag&#333;\)</i></b> for leader of an army or general. But in civic<br>
 life a governor. The technical name for the magistrates in a<br>
 Roman colony was _duumviri_ or duumvirs, answering to consuls in<br>
 Rome. \Strat&#275;goi\ here is the Greek rendering of the Latin<br>
 _praetores_ <b><i>(praetors)</i></b>, a term which they preferred out of pride<br>
 to the term _duumviri_. Since they represented consuls, the<br>
 praetors or duumvirs were accompanied by lictors bearing rods<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->35)</i></b>. <B>{These men}</B> <b><i>(\houtoi hoi anthr&#333;poi\)</i></b>. Contemptuous<br>
 use. <B>{Being Jews}</B> <b><i>(\Ioudaioi huparchontes\)</i></b>. The people of<br>
 Philippi, unlike those in Antioch <b><i>(<!-#-->11:26)</i></b>, did not recognize<br>
 any distinction between Jews and Christians. These four men were<br>
 Jews. This appeal to race prejudice would be especially pertinent<br>
 then because of the recent decree of Claudius expelling Jews from<br>
 Rome <b><i>(<!-#-->18:2)</i></b>. It was about A.D. 49 or 50 that Paul is in<br>
 Philippi. The hatred of the Jews by the Romans is known otherwise<br>
 <b><i>(Cicero, _Pro Flacco_, XXVIII; Juvenal, XIV. 96-106)</i></b>. <B>{Do<br>
 exceedingly trouble}</B> <b><i>(\ektarassousin\)</i></b>. Late compound <b><i>(effective<br>
 use of \ek\ in composition)</i></b> and only here in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 16:21 <B>{Customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to<br>
 observe, being Romans}</B> <b><i>(\eth&#275; ha ouk estin h&#275;min paradechesthai<br>
 oude poiein R&#333;maiois ousin\)</i></b>. Note the sharp contrast between<br>
 "being Jews" in verse <!-#-->20 and "being Romans" here. This pose of<br>
 patriotism is all sound and fury. It is love of money that moves<br>
 these "masters" far more than zeal for Rome. As Roman citizens in<br>
 a colony they make full use of all their rights of protest.<br>
 Judaism was a _religio licita_ in the Roman empire, only they<br>
 were not allowed to make proselytes of the Romans themselves. No<br>
 Roman magistrate would pass on abstract theological questions<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->18:15)</i></b>, but only if a breach of the peace was made<br>
 <b><i>(\ektarassousin h&#275;m&#333;n t&#275;n polin\)</i></b> or the formation of secret<br>
 sects and organizations. Evidently both of these last points are<br>
 involved by the charges of "unlawful customs" by the masters who<br>
 are silent about their real ground of grievance against Paul and<br>
 Silas. \Ethos\ <b><i>(kin to \&#275;thos\, <!-#-->1Co 15:33)</i></b> is from \eth&#333;\, to<br>
 be accustomed or used to a thing. The Romans granted toleration<br>
 to conquered nations to follow their religious customs provided<br>
 they did not try to win the Romans. But the Jews had made great<br>
 headway to favour <b><i>(the God-fearers)</i></b> with increasing hatred also.<br>
 Emperor worship had in store grave peril for both Jews and<br>
 Christians. The Romans will care more for this than for the old<br>
 gods and goddesses. It will combine patriotism and piety.<br>
 <br>
 16:22 <B>{Rose up together}</B> <b><i>(\sunepest&#275;\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active of the double compound \sunephist&#275;mi\,<br>
 intransitive, old verb, but only here in the N.T. <b><i>(cf.<br>
 \katepest&#275;san\ in <!-#-->18:12)</i></b>. There was no actual attack of the mob<br>
 as Paul and Silas were in the hands of the officers, but a sudden<br>
 and violent uprising of the people, the appeal to race and<br>
 national prejudice having raised a ferment. <B>{Rent their garments<br>
 off them}</B> <b><i>(\perir&#275;xantes aut&#333;n ta himatia\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 participle of \perir&#275;gnumi\, old verb, to break off all around,<br>
 to strip or rend all round. Here only in the N.T. The duumvirs<br>
 probably gave orders for Paul and Silas to be stripped of their<br>
 outer garments <b><i>(\himatia\)</i></b>, though not actually doing it with<br>
 their own hands, least of all not stripping off their own<br>
 garments in horror as Ramsay thinks. That would call for the<br>
 middle voice. In II Macc. 4:38 the active voice is used as here<br>
 of stripping off the garments of others. Paul in <!-#-->1Th 2:2 refers<br>
 to the shameful treatment received in Philippi, "insulted"<br>
 <b><i>(\hubristhentas\)</i></b>. As a Roman citizen this was unlawful, but the<br>
 duumvirs looked on Paul and Silas as vagabond and seditious Jews<br>
 and "acted with the highhandedness characteristic of the fussy<br>
 provincial authorities" <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. <B>{Commanded}</B> <b><i>(\ekeleuon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active, repeatedly ordered. The usual formula of<br>
 command was: "Go, lictors; strip off their garments; let them be<br>
 scourged." <B>{To beat them with rods}</B> <b><i>(\rhabdizein\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 active infinitive of \rhabdiz&#333;\, old verb, but in the<br>
 N.T.=_virgis caedere_ only here and <!-#-->2Co 11:25 where Paul<br>
 alludes to this incident and two others not given by Luke <b><i>(\tris<br>
 erhabdisth&#275;n\)</i></b>. He came near getting another in Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 22:25)</i></b>. Why did not Paul say here that he was a Roman citizen as<br>
 he does later <b><i>(verse <!-#-->37)</i></b> and in Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->22:26f.)</i></b>? It might<br>
 have done no good in this hubbub and no opportunity was allowed<br>
 for defence of any kind.<br>
 <br>
 16:23 <B>{When they had laid}</B> <b><i>(\epithentes\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 <b><i>(constative)</i></b> active participle of \epitith&#275;mi\, to place upon.<br>
 <B>{Many stripes}</B> <b><i>(\pollas pl&#275;gas\)</i></b>. The Jewish law was forty<br>
 stripes save one <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:24)</i></b>. The Roman custom depended on the<br>
 caprice of the judge and was a terrible ordeal. It was the custom<br>
 to inflict the stripes on the naked body <b><i>(back)</i></b> as Livy 2.5 says:<br>
 "_Missique lictores ad sumendum supplicium, nudatos virgis<br>
 caedunt_." On \pl&#275;gas\ <b><i>(from \pl&#275;ss&#333;\, to strike a blow)</i></b> see on<br>
 &#175;Lu 10:30; 12:47f. <B>{The jailor}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i desmophulaki\)</i></b>. Late word<br>
 <b><i>(\desmos, phulax\, keeper of bonds)</i></b>, in the N.T. only here<br>
 <b><i>(verses <!-#-->23,27,36)</i></b>. The LXX has the word \archidesmophulax\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge<br>
 39:21-23)</i></b>. Chrysostom calls this jailor Stephanus, he was of<br>
 Achaia <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 16:15)</i></b>. <B>{To keep safely}</B> <b><i>(\asphal&#333;s t&#275;rein\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present active infinitive, to keep on keeping safely, perhaps "as<br>
 dangerous political prisoners" <b><i>(Rackham)</i></b>. He had some rank and<br>
 was not a mere turnkey.<br>
 <br>
 16:24 <B>{Into the inner prison}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n es&#333;teran phulak&#275;n\)</i></b>. The<br>
 comparative form from the adverb \es&#333;\ <b><i>(within)</i></b>, Ionic and old<br>
 Attic for \eis&#333;\. In the LXX, but in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Heb<br>
 6:19. The Roman public prisons had a vestibule and outer prison<br>
 and behind this the inner prison, a veritable dungeon with no<br>
 light or air save what came through the door when open. One has<br>
 only to picture modern cells in our jails, the dungeons in feudal<br>
 castles, London prisons before the time of Howard, to appreciate<br>
 the horrors of an inner prison cell in a Roman provincial town of<br>
 the first century A.D. <B>{Made their feet fast}</B> <b><i>(\tous podas<br>
 &#275;sphalisato aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b> middle of<br>
 \asphaliz&#333;\, from \asphal&#275;s\ <b><i>(safe)</i></b>, common verb in late Greek,<br>
 in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mt 24:64ff. The inner prison was safe<br>
 enough without this refinement of cruelty. <B>{In the stocks}</B> <b><i>(\eis<br>
 to xulon\)</i></b>. \Xulon\, from \xu&#333;\, to scrape or plane, is used for<br>
 a piece of wood whether a cross or gibbet <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 5:30; 10:39;<br>
 13:29; Ga 3:13; 1Pe 2:24)</i></b> or a log or timber with five holes<br>
 <b><i>(four for the wrists and ankles and one for the neck)</i></b> or two for<br>
 the feet as here, \xuloped&#275;\, Latin _vervus_, to shackle the feet<br>
 stretched apart <b><i>(<!-#-->Job 33:11)</i></b>. This torment was practiced in<br>
 Sparta, Athens, Rome, and Adonirom Judson suffered it in Burmah.<br>
 \Xulon\ is also used in the N.T. for stick or staff <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 26:47)</i></b><br>
 and even a tree <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:31)</i></b>. Tertullian said of Christians in<br>
 the stocks: _Nihil crus sentit in vervo, quum animus in caelo<br>
 est_ <b><i>(Nothing the limb feels in the stocks when the mind is in<br>
 heaven)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:25 <B>{About midnight}</B> <b><i>(\kata de mesonuktion\)</i></b>. Middle of the<br>
 night, old adjective seen already in <!-#-->Mr 13:35; Lu 11:5 which<br>
 see. <B>{Were praying and singing}</B> <b><i>(\proseuchomenoi humnoun\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present middle participle and imperfect active indicative:<br>
 Praying they were singing <b><i>(simultaneously, blending together<br>
 petition and praise)</i></b>. \Humne&#333;\ is an old verb from \humnos\ <b><i>(cf.<br>
 <!-#-->Isa 12:4; Da 3:23)</i></b>. Paul and Silas probably used portions of<br>
 the Psalms <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Lu 1:39f.,67f.; 2:28f.)</i></b> with occasional<br>
 original outbursts of praise. <B>{Were listening to them}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ep&#275;kro&#333;nto aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of \epakroaomai\. Rare<br>
 verb to listen with pleasure as to a recitation or music <b><i>(Page)</i></b>.<br>
 It was a new experience for the prisoners and wondrously<br>
 attractive entertainment to them.<br>
 <br>
 16:26 <B>{Earthquake}</B> <b><i>(\seismos\)</i></b>. Old word from \sei&#333;\, to shake.<br>
 Luke regarded it as an answer to prayer as in <!-#-->4:31. He and<br>
 Timothy were not in prison. <B>{So that the foundations of the<br>
 prison house were shaken}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste saleuth&#275;nai ta themelia tou<br>
 desm&#333;t&#275;riou\)</i></b>. Regular construction of the first aorist passive<br>
 infinitive and the accusative of general reference with \h&#333;ste\<br>
 for actual result just like the indicative. This old word for<br>
 prison house already in <!-#-->Mt 11:2; Ac 5:21,23 which see.<br>
 \Themelia\ is neuter plural of the adjective \themelios\, from<br>
 \thema\ <b><i>(thing laid down from \tith&#275;mi\)</i></b>. So already in <!-#-->Lu 6:48;<br>
 14:29. If the prison was excavated from rocks in the hillside,<br>
 as was often the case, the earthquake would easily have slipped<br>
 the bars of the doors loose and the chains would have fallen out<br>
 of the walls. <B>{Were opened}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;ne&#333;ichth&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive indicative of \anoig&#333;\ <b><i>(or \-numi\)</i></b> with triple augment<br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;, e, &#333;\)</i></b>, while there is no augment in \aneth&#275;\ <b><i>(first aorist<br>
 passive indicative of \ani&#275;mi\, were loosed)</i></b>, old verb, but in<br>
 the N.T. only here and <!-#-->27:40; Eph 6:9; Heb 13:5.<br>
 <br>
 16:27 <B>{Being roused out of sleep}</B> <b><i>(\exupnos genomenos\)</i></b>. Becoming<br>
 \exupnos\ <b><i>(rare word, only here in N.T., in LXX and Josephus)</i></b>. An<br>
 earthquake like that would wake up any one. <B>{Open}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ane&#333;igmenos\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle with double<br>
 reduplication in predicate position, standing open. <B>{Drew his<br>
 sword}</B> <b><i>(\spasamenos t&#275;n machairan\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 participle of \spa&#333;\, to draw, as in <!-#-->Mr 14:47, drawing his own<br>
 sword himself. Our word spasm from this old word. <B>{Was about}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;mellen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \mell&#333;\ with both syllabic and<br>
 temporal augment and followed here by present infinitive. He was<br>
 on the point of committing suicide as Brutus had done near here.<br>
 Stoicism had made suicide popular as the escape from trouble like<br>
 the Japanese _harikari_. <B>{Had escaped}</B> <b><i>(\ekpepheugenai\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 perfect active infinitive of \ekpheug&#333;\, old verb with perfective<br>
 force of \ek\, to flee out, to get clean away. This infinitive<br>
 and accusative of general reference is due to indirect discourse<br>
 after \nomiz&#333;n\. Probably the prisoners were so panic stricken by<br>
 the earthquake that they did not rally to the possibility of<br>
 escape before the jailor awoke. He was responsible for the<br>
 prisoners with his life <b><i>(<!-#-->12:19; 27:42)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:28 <B>{Do thyself no harm}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;den prax&#275;is seaut&#333;i kakon\)</i></b>. The<br>
 usual construction <b><i>(\m&#275;\ and the aorist subjunctive)</i></b> for a<br>
 prohibition not to <B>{begin}</B> to do a thing. The older Greek would<br>
 probably have used \poi&#275;s&#275;is\ here. The later Greek does not<br>
 always preserve the old distinction between \poie&#333;\, to do a<br>
 thing, and \prass&#333;\, to practice, though \prassete\ keeps it in<br>
 <!-#-->Php 4:9 and \poie&#333;\ is rightly used in <!-#-->Lu 3:10-14. As a<br>
 matter of fact \prass&#333;\ does not occur in Matthew or in Mark,<br>
 only twice in John, six times in Luke's Gospel, thirteen in Acts,<br>
 and elsewhere by Paul. <B>{Sprang in}</B> <b><i>(\eisep&#275;d&#275;sen\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active of \eisp&#275;da&#333;\, old verb, but here only in the N.T. Cf.<br>
 \ekp&#275;da&#333;\ in <!-#-->14:14. The jailor was at the outer door and he<br>
 wanted lights to see what was inside in the inner prison.<br>
 <br>
 16:29 <B>{Trembling for fear}</B> <b><i>(\entromos genomenos\)</i></b>. "Becoming<br>
 terrified." The adjective \entromos\ <b><i>(in terror)</i></b> occurs in N.T.<br>
 only here and <!-#-->7:32; Heb 12:21. <B>{Fell down}</B> <b><i>(\prosepesen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist active indicative of \prospipt&#333;\, old verb. An act<br>
 of worship as Cornelius before Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->10:25)</i></b>, when<br>
 \prosekun&#275;sen\ is used.<br>
 <br>
 16:30 <B>{Brought them out}</B> <b><i>(\progag&#333;n autous ex&#333;\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active participle of \proag&#333;\, to lead forward. He left the other<br>
 prisoners inside, feeling that he had to deal with these men whom<br>
 he had evidently heard preach or had heard of their message as<br>
 servants of the Most High God as the slave girl called them.<br>
 There may have been superstition behind his fear, but there was<br>
 evident sincerity.<br>
 <br>
 16:31 <B>{To be saved}</B> <b><i>(\hina s&#333;th&#333;\)</i></b>. Final clause with \hina\ and<br>
 first aorist passive subjunctive. What did he mean by "saved"?<br>
 Certainly more than escape from peril about the prisoners or<br>
 because of the earthquake, though these had their influences on<br>
 him. Cf. way of salvation in verse <!-#-->17. <B>{Believe on the Lord<br>
 Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\Pisteuson epi ton kurion I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. This is what Peter<br>
 told Cornelius <b><i>(<!-#-->10:43)</i></b>. This is the heart of the matter for<br>
 both the jailor and his house.<br>
 <br>
 16:32 <B>{They spake the word of God}</B> <b><i>(\elal&#275;san ton logon tou<br>
 theou\)</i></b>. So Paul and Silas gave fuller exposition of the way of<br>
 life to the jailor "with all that were in his house." It was a<br>
 remarkable service with keenest attention and interest, the<br>
 jailor with his warden, slaves, and family.<br>
 <br>
 16:33 <B>{Washed their stripes}</B> <b><i>(\elousen apo t&#333;n pl&#275;g&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Deissmann <b><i>(_Bible Studies_, p. 227)</i></b> cites an inscription of<br>
 Pergamum with this very construction of \apo\ and the ablative,<br>
 to wash off, though it is an old verb. This first aorist active<br>
 indicative of \lou&#333;\, to bathe, succinctly shows what the jailor<br>
 did to remove the stains left by the rods of the lictors <b><i>(verse<br>
 <!-#-->22)</i></b>. \Nipt&#333;\ was used for washing parts of the body. <B>{And was<br>
 baptized, he and all his, immediately}</B> <b><i>(\kai ebaptisth&#275; autos kai<br>
 hoi autou hapantes parachr&#275;ma\)</i></b>. The verb is in the singular<br>
 agreeing with \autos\, but it is to be supplied with \hoi autou\,<br>
 and it was done at once.<br>
 <br>
 16:34 <B>{He brought them up}</B> <b><i>(\anagag&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \anag&#333;\. It looks as if his house was above the<br>
 prison. The baptism apparently took place in the pool or tank in<br>
 which he bathed Paul and Silas <b><i>(De Wette)</i></b> or the rectangular<br>
 basin <b><i>(_impluvium_)</i></b> in the court for receiving the rain or even<br>
 in a swimming pool or bath <b><i>(\kolumb&#275;thra\)</i></b> found within the walls<br>
 of the prison <b><i>(Kuinoel)</i></b>. Meyer: "Perhaps the water was in the<br>
 court of the house; and the baptism was that of immersion, which<br>
 formed an essential part of the symbolism of the act." <B>{Set meat}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pareth&#275;ken trapezan\)</i></b>. Set a "table" before them with food on<br>
 it. They had probably had no food for a day. <B>{With all his house}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\panoikei\)</i></b>. Adverb, once in Plato, though usually \panoiki&#257;i\.<br>
 In LXX, but here alone in the N.T. It is in an amphibolous<br>
 position and can be taken either with "rejoiced" <b><i>(\&#275;galliasato\)</i></b><br>
 or "having believed" <b><i>(\pepisteuk&#333;s\, perfect active participle,<br>
 permanent belief)</i></b>, coming between them. The whole household<br>
 <b><i>(family, warden, slaves)</i></b> heard the word of God, believed in the<br>
 Lord Jesus, made confession, were baptized, and rejoiced.<br>
 Furneaux considers the haste in baptism here "precipitate" as in<br>
 the baptism of the eunuch. But why delay?<br>
 <br>
 16:35 <B>{The serjeants}</B> <b><i>(\tous rhabdouchous\)</i></b>. Fasces-bearers,<br>
 regular Greek word <b><i>(\rhabdos, ech&#333;\)</i></b> for Latin _lictores_ though<br>
 Cicero says that they should carry _baculi_, not _fasces_. Was<br>
 this message because of the earthquake, the influence of Lydia,<br>
 or a belated sense of justice on the part of the magistrates<br>
 <b><i>(praetors)</i></b>? Perhaps a bit of all three may be true. The Codex<br>
 Bezae expressly says that the magistrates "assembled together in<br>
 the market place and recollecting the earthquake that had<br>
 happened they were afraid."<br>
 <br>
 16:36 <B>{Now therefore}</B> <b><i>(\nun oun\)</i></b>. Note both particles <b><i>(time and<br>
 inference)</i></b>. It was a simple matter to the jailor and he was full<br>
 of glee over this happy outcome.<br>
 <br>
 16:37 <B>{Unto them}</B> <b><i>(\pros autous\)</i></b>. The lictors by the jailor. The<br>
 reply of Paul is a marvel of brevity and energy, almost every<br>
 word has a separate indictment showing the utter illegality of<br>
 the whole proceeding. <B>{They have beaten us}</B> <b><i>(\deirantes h&#275;mas\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active participle of \der&#333;\, old verb to flay, to<br>
 skin, to smite. The _Lex Valeria_ B.C. 509 and the _Lex Poscia_<br>
 B.C. 248 made it a crime to inflict blows on a Roman citizen.<br>
 Cicero says, "To fetter a Roman citizen was a crime, to scourge<br>
 him a scandal, to slay him--parricide." Claudius had "deprived<br>
 the city of Rhodes of its freedom for having crucified some<br>
 citizen of Rome" <b><i>(Rackham)</i></b>. <B>{Publicly}</B> <b><i>(\d&#275;mosi&#257;i\)</i></b>. This added<br>
 insult to injury. Common adverb <b><i>(\hod&#333;i\)</i></b> supplied with<br>
 adjective, associative instrumental case, opposed to \idi&#257;i\ or<br>
 \kat' oikous\, <!-#-->Ac 20:20) <B>{Uncondemned}</B> <b><i>(\akatakritous\)</i></b>. This<br>
 same verbal adjective from \kata-krin&#333;\ with \a\ privative is<br>
 used by Paul in <!-#-->22:25 and nowhere else in the N.T. Rare in late<br>
 Greek like \akatagn&#333;stos\, but in late _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(papyri,<br>
 inscriptions)</i></b>. The meaning is clearly "without being tried." Paul<br>
 and Silas were not given a chance to make a defence. They were<br>
 sentenced unheard <b><i>(<!-#-->25:16)</i></b>. Even slaves in Roman law had a right<br>
 to be heard. <B>{Men that are Romans}</B> <b><i>(\anthr&#333;pous Romaious<br>
 huparchontas\)</i></b>. The praetors did not know, of course, that Paul<br>
 and Silas were Roman citizens any more than Lysias knew it in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 22:27. Paul's claim is not challenged in either instance. It was<br>
 a capital offence to make a false claim to Roman citizenship.<br>
 <B>{Have cast us into prison}</B> <b><i>(\ebalan eis phulak&#275;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active indicative of \ball&#333;\, old verb, with first aorist ending<br>
 as often in the _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(\-an\, not \-on\)</i></b>. This was the climax,<br>
 treating them as criminals. <B>{And now privily}</B> <b><i>(\kai nun<br>
 lathr&#257;i\)</i></b>. Paul balances their recent conduct with the former.<br>
 <B>{Nay verily, but}</B> <b><i>(\ou gar, alla\)</i></b>. No indeed! It is the use of<br>
 \gar\ so common in answers <b><i>(\ge+ara\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Mt 27:23. \Alla\<br>
 gives the sharp alternative. <B>{Themselves}</B> <b><i>(\autoi\)</i></b>. As a public<br>
 acknowledgment that they had wronged and mistreated Paul and<br>
 Silas. Let them come themselves and lead us out <b><i>(\exagaget&#333;san\,<br>
 third person plural second aorist active imperative of \exag&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 It was a bitter pill to the proud praetors.<br>
 <br>
 16:39 <B>{They feared}</B> <b><i>(\ephob&#275;th&#275;san\)</i></b>. This is the explanation.<br>
 They became frightened for their own lives when they saw what<br>
 they had done to Roman citizens. <B>{They asked}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;r&#333;t&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active of \er&#333;ta&#333;\. They kept on begging them to leave<br>
 for fear of further trouble. The colonists in Philippi would turn<br>
 against the praetors if they learned the facts, proud as they<br>
 were of being citizens. This verb in the _Koin&#275;_ is often used as<br>
 here to make a request and not just to ask a question.<br>
 <br>
 16:40 <B>{Into the house of Lydia}</B> <b><i>(\pros t&#275;n Ludian\)</i></b>. No word in<br>
 the Greek for "house," but it means the house of Lydia. Note "the<br>
 brethren" here, not merely Luke and Timothy, but other brethren<br>
 now converted besides those in the house of the jailor. The four<br>
 missionaries were guests of Lydia <b><i>(verse <!-#-->15)</i></b> and probably the<br>
 church now met in her home. <B>{They departed}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#275;lthan\)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 and Silas, but not Luke and Timothy. Note "they" here, not "we."<br>
 Note also the \-an\ ending instead of \-on\ as above. The<br>
 movements of Timothy are not perfectly clear till he reappears at<br>
 Beroea <b><i>(<!-#-->17:15)</i></b>. It seems unlikely that he came to Thessalonica<br>
 with Paul and Silas since only Paul and Silas obtained security<br>
 there <b><i>(<!-#-->17:9)</i></b> and were sent on to Beroea <b><i>(<!-#-->17:10)</i></b>. Probably<br>
 Timothy was sent to Thessalonica from Philippi with gifts of<br>
 which Paul spoke later <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 4:15f.)</i></b>. Then he followed Paul and<br>
 Silas to Beroea.<br>
