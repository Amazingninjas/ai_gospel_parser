<p>15:1 <B>{And certain men came down from Judea}</B> <b><i>(\kai tines<br>
 katelthontes apo t&#275;s Ioudaias\)</i></b>. Evidently the party of the<br>
 circumcision in the church in Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->11:2)</i></b> had heard of the<br>
 spread of the gospel among the Gentiles in Cyprus, Pamphylia, and<br>
 South Galatia <b><i>(Phrygia, Pisidia, Lycaonia)</i></b>. Possibly John Mark<br>
 after his desertion at Perga <b><i>(<!-#-->13:13)</i></b> told of this as one of his<br>
 reasons for coming home. At any rate echoes of the jubilation in<br>
 Antioch in Syria would be certain to reach Jerusalem. The<br>
 Judaizers in Jerusalem, who insisted that all the Gentile<br>
 Christians must become Jews also, had acquiesced in the case of<br>
 Cornelius and his group <b><i>(<!-#-->11:1-18)</i></b> after plain proof by Peter<br>
 that it was the Lord's doing. But they had not agreed to a formal<br>
 campaign to turn the exception into the rule and to make<br>
 Christianity mainly Gentile with a few Jews instead of mainly<br>
 Jewish with a few Gentiles. Since Paul and Barnabas did not come<br>
 up to Jerusalem, the leaders among the Judaizers decided to go<br>
 down to Antioch and attack Paul and Barnabas there. They had<br>
 volunteered to go without church action in Jerusalem for their<br>
 activity is disclaimed by the conference <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:24)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Ga<br>
 2:4 Paul with some heat describes these Judaizers as "false<br>
 brethren, secretly introduced who sneaked in to spy out our<br>
 liberty." It is reasonably certain that this visit to Jerusalem<br>
 described in <!-#-->Ga 2:1-10 is the same one as the Jerusalem<br>
 Conference in Acts <!-#-->15:5-29 in spite of the effort of Ramsay to<br>
 identify it with that in <!-#-->11:29f. Paul in Galatians is not<br>
 giving a list of his visits to Jerusalem. He is showing his<br>
 independence of the twelve apostles and his equality with them.<br>
 He did not see them in <!-#-->11:29f., but only "the elders." In <!-#-->Ac<br>
 15 Luke gives the outward narrative of events, in <!-#-->Ga 2:1-10<br>
 Paul shows us the private interview with the apostles when they<br>
 agreed on their line of conduct toward the Judaizers. In <!-#-->Ga 2:2<br>
 by the use of "them" <b><i>(\autois\)</i></b> Paul seems to refer to the first<br>
 public meeting in Acts before the private interview that came in<br>
 between verses <!-#-->15:5-6. If we recall the difficulty that Peter<br>
 had on the subject of preaching the gospel to the heathen<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->10:1-11:18)</i></b>, we can the better understand the attitude of the<br>
 Judaizers. They were men of sincere convictions without a doubt,<br>
 but they were obscurantists and unable and unwilling to receive<br>
 new light from the Lord on a matter that involved their racial<br>
 and social prejudices. They recalled that Jesus himself had been<br>
 circumcised and that he had said to the Syro-Phoenician woman<br>
 that he had come only save to the lost sheep of the house of<br>
 Israel <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 15:24ff.)</i></b>. They argued that Christ had not repealed<br>
 circumcision. So one of the great religious controversies of all<br>
 time was begun, that between spiritual religion and ritualistic<br>
 or ceremonial religion. It is with us yet with baptism taking the<br>
 place of circumcision. These self-appointed champions of<br>
 circumcision for Gentile Christians were deeply in earnest.<br>
 <B>{Taught the brethren}</B> <b><i>(\edidaskon tous adelphous\)</i></b>. Inchoative<br>
 imperfect active, began to teach and kept it up. Their attitude<br>
 was one of supercilious superiority. They probably resented the<br>
 conduct of Barnabas, who, when sent by the Church in Jerusalem to<br>
 investigate the conversion of the Greeks in Antioch <b><i>(<!-#-->11:20-26)</i></b>,<br>
 did not return and report till a strong church had been<br>
 established there with the help of Saul and only then with a big<br>
 collection to confuse the issue. Paul and Barnabas were on hand,<br>
 but the Judaizers persisted in their efforts to force their views<br>
 on the church in Antioch. It was a crisis. <B>{Except ye be<br>
 circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved}</B> <b><i>(\ean<br>
 me peritm&#275;th&#275;te t&#333;i ethei M&#333;use&#333;s, ou dunasthe s&#333;th&#275;nai\)</i></b>. There<br>
 was the dictum of the Judaizers to the Gentiles. Paul and<br>
 Barnabas had been circumcised. This is probably the precise<br>
 language employed, for they spoke in Greek to these Greeks. It is<br>
 a condition of the third class <b><i>(undetermined, but with prospect<br>
 of being determined, \ean\ plus the first aorist passive<br>
 subjunctive of \peritemn&#333;\)</i></b>. There was thus hope held out for<br>
 them, but only on condition that they be circumcised. The issue<br>
 was sharply drawn. The associative instrumental case <b><i>(\t&#333;i<br>
 ethei\)</i></b> is customary. "Saved" <b><i>(\s&#333;th&#275;nai\)</i></b> here is the Messianic<br>
 salvation. This doctrine denied the efficacy of the work of<br>
 Christ.<br>
 <br>
 15:2 <B>{When Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and<br>
 questioning with them}</B> <b><i>(\Genomen&#275;s stase&#333;s kai z&#275;t&#275;se&#333;s ouk<br>
 olig&#275;s t&#333;i Paul&#333;i kai Barnab&#257;i pros autous\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute<br>
 of second aorist middle participle of \ginomai\, genitive<br>
 singular agreeing with first substantive \stase&#333;s\. Literally,<br>
 "No little <b><i>(litotes for much)</i></b> strife and questioning coming to<br>
 Paul and Barnabas <b><i>(dative case)</i></b> with them " <b><i>(\pros autous\, face<br>
 to face with them)</i></b>. Paul and Barnabas were not willing to see<br>
 this Gentile church brow-beaten and treated as heretics by these<br>
 self-appointed regulators of Christian orthodoxy from Jerusalem.<br>
 The work had developed under the leadership of Paul and Barnabas<br>
 and they accepted full responsibility for it and stoutly resisted<br>
 these Judaizers to the point of sedition <b><i>(riot, outbreak in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 23:25; Ac 19:40)</i></b> as in <!-#-->23:7. There is no evidence that the<br>
 Judaizers had any supporters in the Antioch church so that they<br>
 failed utterly to make any impression. Probably these Judaizers<br>
 compelled Paul to think through afresh his whole gospel of grace<br>
 and so they did Paul and the world a real service. If the Jews<br>
 like Paul had to believe, it was plain that there was no virtue<br>
 in circumcision <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 2:15-21)</i></b>. It is not true that the early<br>
 Christians had no disagreements. They had selfish avarice with<br>
 Ananias and Sapphira, murmuring over the gifts to the widows,<br>
 simony in the case of Simon Magus, violent objection to work in<br>
 Caesarea, and now open strife over a great doctrine <b><i>(grace vs.<br>
 legalism)</i></b>. <B>{The brethren appointed}</B> <b><i>(\etaxan\)</i></b>. "The brethren"<br>
 can be supplied from verse <!-#-->1 and means the church in Antioch.<br>
 The church clearly saw that the way to remove this deadlock<br>
 between the Judaizers and Paul and Barnabas was to consult the<br>
 church in Jerusalem to which the Judaizers belonged. Paul and<br>
 Barnabas had won in Antioch. If they can win in Jerusalem, that<br>
 will settle the matter. The Judaizers will be answered in their<br>
 own church for which they are presuming to speak. The verb<br>
 \etaxan\ <b><i>(\tass&#333;\, to arrange)</i></b> suggests a formal appointment by<br>
 the church in regular assembly. Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 2:2)</i></b> says that he went<br>
 up by revelation <b><i>(\kat' apokalupsin\)</i></b>, but surely that is not<br>
 contradictory to the action of the church. <B>{Certain others of<br>
 them}</B> <b><i>(\tinas allous\)</i></b>. Certainly Titus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 2:1,3)</i></b>, a Greek and<br>
 probably a brother of Luke who is not mentioned in Acts. Rackham<br>
 thinks that Luke was in the number. <B>{The apostles and elders}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\tous apostolous kai presbuterous\)</i></b>. Note one article for both<br>
 <b><i>(cf. "the apostles and the brethren" in <!-#-->11:1)</i></b>. "Elders" now<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->11:30)</i></b> in full force. The apostles have evidently returned now<br>
 to the city after the death of Herod Agrippa I stopped the<br>
 persecution.<br>
 <br>
 15:3 <B>{They therefore}</B> <b><i>(\hoi men oun\)</i></b>. Luke's favourite method of<br>
 resumptive narrative as we have seen <b><i>(<!-#-->11:19, etc.)</i></b>,<br>
 demonstrative \hoi\ with \men\ <b><i>(indeed)</i></b> and \oun\ <b><i>(therefore)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Being brought on their way by the church}</B> <b><i>(\propemphthentes hupo<br>
 t&#275;s ekkl&#275;sias\)</i></b>. First aorist passive participle of \propemp&#333;\,<br>
 old verb, to send forward under escort as a mark of honour as in<br>
 <!-#-->20:38; 21:5; 3Jo 1:6. They were given a grand send-off by the<br>
 church in Antioch. <B>{Passed through}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;rchonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 middle describing the triumphal procession through both <b><i>(\te<br>
 kai\)</i></b> Phoenicia and Samaria. <B>{The conversion}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n<br>
 epistroph&#275;n\)</i></b>. The turning. <B>{They caused great joy}</B> <b><i>(\epoioun<br>
 charan megal&#275;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. They were raising a constant<br>
 paean of praise as they proceeded toward Jerusalem. Probably the<br>
 Judaizers had gone on or kept still.<br>
 <br>
 15:4 <B>{Were received}</B> <b><i>(\paredechth&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative of \paradechomai\, old verb, to receive, to welcome.<br>
 Here it was a public reception for Paul and Barnabas provided by<br>
 the whole church including the apostles and elders, at which an<br>
 opportunity was given to hear the story of Paul and Barnabas<br>
 about God's dealings with them among the Gentiles. This first<br>
 public meeting is referred to by Paul in <!-#-->Ga 2:2 "I set before<br>
 them <b><i>(\autois\)</i></b> the gospel, etc."<br>
 <br>
 15:5 <B>{But there rose up}</B> <b><i>(\exanest&#275;san de\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b>. Note both \ex\ and \an\. These men<br>
 rose up out of the crowd at a critical moment. They were<br>
 believers in Christ <b><i>(\pepisteukotes\, having believed)</i></b>, but were<br>
 still members of "the sect of the Pharisees" <b><i>(\t&#275;s hairese&#333;s t&#333;n<br>
 Pharisai&#333;n\)</i></b>. Evidently they still held to the Pharisaic<br>
 narrowness shown in the attack on Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->11:2f.)</i></b>. Note the<br>
 dogmatism of their "must" <b><i>(\dei\)</i></b> after the opposition of Paul<br>
 and Barnabas to their "except" <b><i>(\ean me\)</i></b> at Antioch <b><i>(<!-#-->15:1)</i></b>.<br>
 They are unconvinced and expected to carry the elders with them.<br>
 Codex Bezae says that they had appealed to the elders <b><i>(<!-#-->15:2,5)</i></b>.<br>
 At any rate they have made the issue in open meeting at the<br>
 height of the jubilation. It is plain from verse <!-#-->6 that this<br>
 meeting was adjourned, for another gathering came together then.<br>
 It is here that the private conference of which Paul speaks in<br>
 <!-#-->Ga 2:1-10 took place. It was Paul's chance to see the leaders<br>
 in Jerusalem <b><i>(Peter, James, and John)</i></b> and he won them over to his<br>
 view of Gentile liberty from the Mosaic law so that the next<br>
 public conference <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:6-29)</i></b> ratified heartily the views of<br>
 Paul, Barnabas, Peter, James, and John. It was a diplomatic<br>
 triumph of the first order and saved Christianity from the<br>
 bondage of Jewish ceremonial sacramentalism. So far as we know<br>
 this is the only time that Paul and John met face to face, the<br>
 great spirits in Christian history after Jesus our Lord. It is a<br>
 bit curious to see men saying today that Paul surrendered about<br>
 Titus and had him circumcised for the sake of peace, the very<br>
 opposite of what he says in Galatians, "to whom I yielded, no not<br>
 for an hour." Titus as a Greek was a red flag to the Judaizers<br>
 and to the compromisers, but Paul stood his ground.<br>
 <br>
 15:6 <B>{Were gathered together}</B> <b><i>(\sun&#275;chth&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 <b><i>(effective)</i></b> passive indicative. The church is not named here as<br>
 in verse <!-#-->4, but we know from verses <!-#-->12-22 that the whole<br>
 church came together this time also along with the apostles and<br>
 elders. <B>{Of this matter}</B> <b><i>(\peri tou logou toutou\)</i></b>. Same idiom in<br>
 <!-#-->8:21; 19:38. They realized the importance of the issue.<br>
 <br>
 15:7 <B>{When there had been much questioning}</B> <b><i>(\poll&#275;s z&#275;t&#275;se&#333;s<br>
 genomen&#275;s\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute with second aorist middle<br>
 participle of \ginomai\. Evidently the Judaizers were given full<br>
 opportunity to air all their grievances and objections. They were<br>
 allowed plenty of time and there was no effort to shut off debate<br>
 or to rush anything through the meeting. <B>{Peter rose up}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anastas Petros\)</i></b>. The wonder was that he had waited so long.<br>
 Probably Paul asked him to do so. He was the usual spokesman for<br>
 the apostles and his activities in Jerusalem were well-known. In<br>
 particular his experience at Caesarea <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10)</i></b> had caused<br>
 trouble here in Jerusalem from this very same party of the<br>
 circumcism <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:1-18)</i></b>. It was fitting that Peter should<br>
 speak. This is the last time that Peter appears in the Acts. <B>{A<br>
 good while ago}</B> <b><i>(\aph' h&#275;mer&#333;n archai&#333;n\)</i></b>. From ancient days. The<br>
 adjective \archaios\ is from \arch&#275;\, beginning, and its actual<br>
 age is a matter of relativity. So Mnason <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 21:16)</i></b> is termed<br>
 "an ancient disciple." It was probably a dozen years since God<br>
 "made choice" <b><i>(\exelexato\)</i></b> to speak by Peter's mouth to<br>
 Cornelius and the other Gentiles in Caesarea. His point is that<br>
 what Paul and Barnabas have reported is nothing new. The<br>
 Judaizers made objection then as they are doing now.<br>
 <br>
 15:8 <B>{Which knoweth the heart}</B> <b><i>(\kardiogn&#333;st&#275;s\)</i></b>. Late word from<br>
 \kardia\ <b><i>(heart)</i></b> and \gn&#333;st&#275;s\ <b><i>(known, \gin&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b>. In the N.T.<br>
 only here and <!-#-->1:24 which see. <B>{Giving them the Holy Spirit}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dous to pneuma to hagion\)</i></b>. And before their baptism. This was<br>
 the Lord's doing. They had accepted <b><i>(<!-#-->11:18)</i></b> this witness of God<br>
 then and it was true now of these other Gentile converts.<br>
 <br>
 15:9 <B>{He made no distinction between us and them}</B> <b><i>(\outhen<br>
 diekrinen metaxu h&#275;m&#333;n te kai aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. He distinguished nothing<br>
 <b><i>(first aorist active ind.)</i></b> between <b><i>(both \dia\ and \metaxu\)</i></b> both<br>
 <b><i>(\te kai\)</i></b> us and them. In the matter of faith and conversion God<br>
 treated us Jews as heathen and the heathen as Jews. <B>{Cleansing<br>
 their hearts by faith}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i pistei katharisas tas kardias<br>
 aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Not by works nor by ceremonies. Peter here has a<br>
 thoroughly Pauline and Johannine idea of salvation for all both<br>
 Jew and Greek. Cf. <!-#-->10:15.<br>
 <br>
 15:10 <B>{Why tempt ye God?}</B> <b><i>(\ti peirazete ton theon;\)</i></b>. By<br>
 implying that God had made a mistake this time, though right<br>
 about Cornelius. It is a home-thrust. They were refusing to<br>
 follow the guidance of God like the Israelites at Massah and<br>
 Meribah <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 17:7; De 6:16; 1Co 10:9)</i></b>. <B>{That ye should put}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epitheinai\)</i></b>. Second aorist active infinitive of \epitith&#275;mi\,<br>
 epexegetic, explaining the tempting. <B>{A yoke upon the neck}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\zugon epi ton trach&#275;lon\)</i></b>. Familiar image of oxen with yokes<br>
 upon the necks. Paul's very image for the yoke of bondage of the<br>
 Mosaic law in <!-#-->Ga 5:1. It had probably been used in the private<br>
 interview. Cf. the words of Jesus about the Pharisees <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 23:4)</i></b><br>
 and how easy and light his own yoke is <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 11:30)</i></b>. <B>{Were able<br>
 to bear}</B> <b><i>(\ischusamen bastasai\)</i></b>. Neither our fathers nor we had<br>
 strength <b><i>(\ischu&#333;\)</i></b> to carry this yoke which the Judaizers wish<br>
 to put on the necks of the Gentiles. Peter speaks as the<br>
 spiritual emancipator. He had been slow to see the meaning of<br>
 God's dealings with him at Joppa and Caesarea, but he has seen<br>
 clearly by now. He takes his stand boldly with Paul and Barnabas<br>
 for Gentile freedom.<br>
 <br>
 15:11 <B>{That we shall be saved}</B> <b><i>(\s&#333;th&#275;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 infinitive in indirect discourse after \pisteuomen\. More<br>
 exactly, "We believe that we are saved through the grace of the<br>
 Lord Jesus in like manner as they also." This thoroughly Pauline<br>
 note shows that whatever hopes the Judaizers had about Peter were<br>
 false. His doctrine of grace is as clear as a bell. He has lifted<br>
 his voice against salvation by ceremony and ritualism. It was a<br>
 great deliverance.<br>
 <br>
 15:12 <B>{Kept silence}</B> <b><i>(\esig&#275;sen\)</i></b>. Ingressive first aorist active<br>
 of \siga&#333;\, old verb, to hold one's peace. All the multitude<br>
 became silent after Peter's speech and because of it. <B>{Hearkened}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;kouon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \akou&#333;\, descriptive of the rapt<br>
 attention, were listening. <B>{Unto Barnabas and Paul}</B> <b><i>(\Barnaba kai<br>
 Paulou\)</i></b>. Note placing Barnabas before Paul as in verse <!-#-->25,<br>
 possibly because in Jerusalem Barnabas was still better known<br>
 than Paul. <B>{Rehearsing}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#275;goumen&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 participle of \ex&#275;geomai\, old verb, to go through or lead out a<br>
 narrative of events as in <!-#-->Lu 24:35; Ac 10:8 which see. Three<br>
 times <b><i>(<!-#-->14:27; 15:4,12)</i></b> Paul is described as telling the facts<br>
 about their mission work, facts more eloquent than argument<br>
 <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. One of the crying needs in the churches is fuller<br>
 knowledge of the facts of mission work and progress with enough<br>
 detail to give life and interest. The signs and wonders which God<br>
 had wrought among the Gentiles set the seal of approval on the<br>
 work done through <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> Barnabas and Paul. This had been<br>
 Peter's argument about Cornelius <b><i>(<!-#-->11:17)</i></b>. This same verb<br>
 <b><i>(\ex&#275;g&#275;sato\)</i></b> is used by James in verse <!-#-->14 referring to Peter's<br>
 speech.<br>
 <br>
 15:13 <B>{After they had held their peace}</B> <b><i>(\meta to sig&#275;sai<br>
 autous\)</i></b>. Literally, "after the becoming silent <b><i>(ingressive<br>
 aorist active of the articular infinitive)</i></b> as to them <b><i>(Barnabas<br>
 and Paul, accusative of general reference)</i></b>." <B>{James answered}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\apekrith&#275; Iak&#333;bos\)</i></b>. First aorist passive <b><i>(deponent)</i></b><br>
 indicative. It was expected that James, as President of the<br>
 Conference, would speak last. But he wisely waited to give every<br>
 one an opportunity to speak. The challenge of the Judaizers<br>
 called for an opinion from James. Furneaux thinks that he may<br>
 have been elected one of the twelve to take the place of James<br>
 the brother of John since Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 1:19)</i></b> calls him apostle.<br>
 More likely he was asked to preside because of his great gifts<br>
 and character as chief of the elders.<br>
 <br>
 15:14 <B>{Hearken unto me}</B> <b><i>(\akousate mou\)</i></b>. Usual appeal for<br>
 attention. James was termed James the Just and was considered a<br>
 representative of the Hebraic as opposed to the Hellenistic wing<br>
 of the Jewish Christians <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 6:1)</i></b>. The Judaizers had doubtless<br>
 counted on him as a champion of their view and did later<br>
 wrongfully make use of his name against Peter at Antioch <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga<br>
 2:12)</i></b>. There was instant attention when James began to speak.<br>
 <B>{Symeon}</B> <b><i>(\Sume&#333;n\)</i></b>. The Aramaic form of Simon as in <!-#-->2Pe 2:1.<br>
 This little touch would show his affinities with the Jewish<br>
 Christians <b><i>(not the Judaizers)</i></b>. This Aramaic form is used also in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 2:25,34 of the old prophet in the temple. Possibly both<br>
 forms <b><i>(Symeon, Aramaic, and Simon, Greek)</i></b> were current in<br>
 Jerusalem. <B>{How}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s\)</i></b>. Strictly, "according as," here like<br>
 \hos\ in indirect discourse somewhat like the epexegetic or<br>
 explanatory use in <!-#-->3Jo 1:3. <B>{First}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;ton\)</i></b>. Told by Peter<br>
 in verse <!-#-->7. James notes, as Peter did, that this experience of<br>
 Barnabas and Paul is not the beginning of work among the<br>
 Gentiles. <B>{Did visit}</B> <b><i>(\epeskepsato\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 indicative of \episkeptomai\, old verb to look upon, to look<br>
 after, provide for. This same verb occurs in <!-#-->Jas 1:27 and is<br>
 one of various points of similarity between this speech of James<br>
 in Acts and the Epistle of James as shown by Mayor in his<br>
 _Commentary on James_. Somehow Luke may have obtained notes of<br>
 these various addresses. <B>{To take from the Gentiles a people for<br>
 his name}</B> <b><i>(\labein ex ethn&#333;n laon t&#333;i onomati autou\)</i></b>. Bengel<br>
 calls this _egregium paradoxon_, a chosen people <b><i>(\laon\)</i></b> out of<br>
 the Gentiles <b><i>(\ethn&#333;n\)</i></b>. This is what is really involved in what<br>
 took place at Caesarea at the hands of Peter and the campaign of<br>
 Barnabas and Paul from Antioch. But such a claim of God's purpose<br>
 called for proof from Scripture to convince Jews and this is<br>
 precisely what James undertakes to give. This new Israel from<br>
 among the Gentiles is one of Paul's great doctrines as set forth<br>
 in <!-#-->Ga 3; Ro 9-11. Note the use of God's "name" here for "the<br>
 Israel of God" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 6:16)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:15 <B>{To this agree}</B> <b><i>(\tout&#333;i sumph&#333;nousin\)</i></b>. Associative<br>
 instrumental case <b><i>(\tout&#333;i\)</i></b> after \sumph&#333;nousin\ <b><i>(voice together<br>
 with, symphony with, harmonize with)</i></b>, from \sumph&#333;ne&#333;\, old verb<br>
 seen already in <!-#-->Mt 18:19; Lu 5:36; Ac 5:9 which see. James<br>
 cites only <!-#-->Am 9:11,12 from the LXX as an example of "the words<br>
 of the prophets" <b><i>(\hoi logoi t&#333;n proph&#275;t&#333;n\)</i></b> to which he refers<br>
 on this point. The somewhat free quotation runs here through<br>
 verses <!-#-->16-18 of <!-#-->Ac 15 and is exceedingly pertinent. The<br>
 Jewish rabbis often failed to understand the prophets as Jesus<br>
 showed. The passage in Amos refers primarily to the restoration<br>
 of the Davidic empire, but also the Messiah's Kingdom <b><i>(the throne<br>
 of David his father," <!-#-->Lu 1:32)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:16 <B>{I will build again}</B> <b><i>(\anoikodom&#275;s&#333;\)</i></b>. Here LXX has<br>
 \anast&#275;s&#333;\. Compound <b><i>(\ana\, up or again)</i></b> of \oikodome&#333;\, the<br>
 verb used by Jesus in <!-#-->Mt 16:18 of the general church or kingdom<br>
 as here which see. <B>{The tabernacle of David}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n sk&#275;n&#275;n<br>
 Daueid\)</i></b>, a poetical figure of the throne of David <b><i>(<!-#-->2Sa 7:12)</i></b><br>
 now "the fallen tent" <b><i>(\t&#275;n pept&#333;kuian\)</i></b>, perfect active<br>
 participle of \pipt&#333;\, state of completion. <B>{The ruins thereof}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ta katestrammena aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Literally, "the ruined portions of<br>
 it." Perfect passive participle of \katastreph&#333;\, to turn down.<br>
 It is a desolate picture of the fallen, torn down tent of David.<br>
 <B>{I will let it up}</B> <b><i>(\anorth&#333;s&#333;\)</i></b>. Old verb from \anortho&#333;\ <b><i>(\ana,<br>
 orthos\)</i></b>, to set upright. See on <!-#-->Lu 3:13 of the old woman whose<br>
 crooked back was set straight.<br>
 <br>
 15:17 <B>{That the residue of men may seek after the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\hop&#333;s<br>
 an ekz&#275;t&#275;s&#333;sin hoi kataloipoi t&#333;n anthr&#333;p&#333;n ton kurion\)</i></b>. The use<br>
 of \hop&#333;s\ with the subjunctive <b><i>(effective aorist active)</i></b> to<br>
 express purpose is common enough and note \an\ for an additional<br>
 tone of uncertainty. On the rarity of \an\ with \hop&#333;s\ in the<br>
 _Koin&#275;_ see Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 986. Here the Gentiles are<br>
 referred to. The Hebrew text is quite different, "that they may<br>
 possess the remnant of Edom." Certainly the LXX suits best the<br>
 point that James is making. But the closing words of this verse<br>
 point definitely to the Gentiles both in the Hebrew and the LXX,<br>
 "all the Gentiles" <b><i>(\panta ta ethn&#275;\)</i></b>. Another item of similarity<br>
 between this speech and the Epistle of James is in the phrase "my<br>
 name is called" <b><i>(\epikekl&#275;tai to onoma mou\)</i></b> and <!-#-->Jas 2:7. The<br>
 purpose of God, though future, is expressed by this perfect<br>
 passive indicative \epikekl&#275;tai\ from \epi-kale&#333;\, to call on. It<br>
 is a Jewish way of speaking of those who worship God.<br>
 <br>
 15:18 <B>{From the beginning of the world}</B> <b><i>(\ap' ai&#333;nos\)</i></b>. Or, "from<br>
 of old." James adds these words, perhaps with a reminiscence of<br>
 <!-#-->Isa 45:21. His point is that this purpose of God, as set forth<br>
 in Amos, is an old one. God has an Israel outside of and beyond<br>
 the Jewish race, whom he will make his true "Israel" and so there<br>
 is no occasion for surprise in the story of God's dealings with<br>
 the Gentiles as told by Barnabas and Paul. God's eternal purpose<br>
 of grace includes all who call upon his name in every land and<br>
 people <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 2:1; Mic 4:1)</i></b>. This larger and richer purpose and<br>
 plan of God was one of the mysteries which Paul will unfold in<br>
 the future <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 16:25; Eph 3:9)</i></b>. James sees it clearly now. God<br>
 is making it known <b><i>(\poi&#333;n tauta gn&#333;sta\)</i></b>, if they will only be<br>
 willing to see and understand. It was a great deliverance that<br>
 James had made and it exerted a profound influence on the<br>
 assembly.<br>
 <br>
 15:19 <B>{Wherefore}</B> <b><i>(\dio\)</i></b>. "Because of which," this plain purpose<br>
 of God as shown by Amos and Isaiah. <B>{My judgment is}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333;<br>
 krin&#333;\)</i></b>. Note expression of \eg&#333;\. <B>{I give my judgment}</B>. <b><i>(\Ego<br>
 censeo\)</i></b>. James sums up the case as President of the Conference<br>
 in a masterly fashion and with that consummate wisdom for which<br>
 he is noted. It amounts to a resolution for the adoption by the<br>
 assembly as happened <b><i>(verse <!-#-->33)</i></b>. <B>{That we trouble not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;<br>
 parenochlein\)</i></b>. Present active infinitive with \m&#275;\ in an<br>
 indirect command <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1046)</i></b> of<br>
 \parenochle&#333;\, a common late verb, occurring here alone in the<br>
 N.T. This double compound <b><i>(\para, en\)</i></b> is from the old compound<br>
 \enochle&#333;\ <b><i>(\en\ and \ochlos\, crowd, annoyance)</i></b> seen in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 6:18; Heb 12:15, and means to cause trouble beside <b><i>(\para\)</i></b> one<br>
 or in a matter. This is the general point of James which he<br>
 explains further concerning "those who are turning from the<br>
 Gentiles unto God," the very kind of people referred to in Amos.<br>
 <br>
 15:20 <B>{But that we write unto them}</B> <b><i>(\alla episteilai autois\)</i></b>.<br>
 By way of contrast <b><i>(\alla\)</i></b>. First aorist active infinitive of<br>
 \epistell&#333;\, old verb to send to one <b><i>(message, letter, etc.)</i></b>. Our<br>
 word \epistle\ <b><i>(\epistol&#275;\ as in verse <!-#-->30)</i></b> comes from this<br>
 verb. In the N.T. only here, <!-#-->He 13:22, and possibly <!-#-->Ac 21:25.<br>
 <B>{That they abstain from}</B> <b><i>(\tou apechesthai\)</i></b>. The genitive of the<br>
 articular infinitive of purpose, present middle <b><i>(direct)</i></b> of<br>
 \apech&#333;\, old verb, to hold oneself back from. The best old MSS.<br>
 do not have \apo\, but the ablative is clear enough in what<br>
 follows. James agrees with Peter in his support of Paul and<br>
 Barnabas in their contention for Gentile freedom from the Mosaic<br>
 ceremonial law. The restrictions named by James affect the moral<br>
 code that applies to all <b><i>(idolatry, fornication, murder)</i></b>.<br>
 Idolatry, fornication and murder were the outstanding sins of<br>
 paganism then and now <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 22:15)</i></b>. Harnack argues ably against<br>
 the genuineness of the word \pniktou\ <b><i>(strangled)</i></b> which is absent<br>
 from D Irenaeus, Tertullian, Cyprian. It is a nice point, though<br>
 the best MSS. have it in accord with <!-#-->Le 17:10-16. The problem<br>
 is whether the words were added because "blood" was understood as<br>
 not "murder," but a reference to the Mosaic regulation or whether<br>
 it was omitted to remove the ceremonial aspect and make it all<br>
 moral and ethical. The Western text omits the word also in verse<br>
 <!-#-->29. But with the word retained here and in verse <!-#-->29 the<br>
 solution of James is not a compromise, though there is a wise<br>
 concession to Jewish feeling. <B>{Pollutions of idols}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\alisg&#275;mat&#333;n\)</i></b>. From \alisge&#333;\ only in the LXX and this<br>
 substantive nowhere else. The word refers to idolatrous practices<br>
 <b><i>(pollutions)</i></b> and things sacrificed to idols <b><i>(\eid&#333;luth&#333;n\)</i></b> in<br>
 verse <!-#-->29, not to sacrificial meat sold in the market <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 10:27)</i></b>, a matter not referred to here. Cf. <!-#-->Le 17:1-9. All the<br>
 four items in the position of James <b><i>(accepting \pniktou\)</i></b> are<br>
 mentioned in <!-#-->Le 17,18.<br>
 <br>
 15:21 <B>{For Moses}</B> <b><i>(\M&#333;us&#275;s gar\)</i></b>. A reason why these four<br>
 necessary things <b><i>(verse <!-#-->28)</i></b> are named. In every city are<br>
 synagogues where rabbis proclaim <b><i>(\k&#275;russontas\)</i></b> these matters.<br>
 Hence the Gentile Christians would be giving constant offence to<br>
 neglect them. The only point where modern Christian sentiment<br>
 would object would be about "things strangled" and "blood" in the<br>
 sense of any blood left in the animals, though most Christians<br>
 probably agree with the feeling of James in objecting to blood in<br>
 the food. If "blood" is taken to be "murder," that difficulty<br>
 vanishes. Moses will suffer no loss for these Gentile Christians<br>
 are not adherents of Judaism.<br>
 <br>
 15:22 <B>{Then it seemed good}</B> <b><i>(\Tote edoxen\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of \doke&#333;\. A regular idiom at the beginning of<br>
 decrees. This Eirenicon of James commended itself to the whole<br>
 assembly. Apparently a vote was taken which was unanimous, the<br>
 Judaizers probably not voting. The apostles and the elders <b><i>(\tois<br>
 apostolois kai tois presbuterois\, article with each, dative<br>
 case)</i></b> probably all vocally expressed their position. <B>{With the<br>
 whole church}</B> <b><i>(\sun holei t&#275;i ekkl&#275;si&#257;i\)</i></b>. Probably by<br>
 acclamation. It was a great victory. But James was a practical<br>
 leader and he did not stop with speeches and a vote. <B>{To choose<br>
 men out of their company}</B> <b><i>(\eklezamenous andras ex aut&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Accusative case, though dative just before <b><i>(\tois apostolois\,<br>
 etc.)</i></b>, of first aorist middle participle of \ekleg&#333;\, to select.<br>
 This loose case agreement appears also in \grapsantes\ in verse<br>
 <!-#-->23 and in MSS. in verse <!-#-->25. It is a common thing in all Greek<br>
 writers <b><i>(Paul, for instance)</i></b>, especially in the papyri and in the<br>
 Apocalypse of John. <B>{Judas called Barsabbas}</B> <b><i>(\Ioudan ton<br>
 kaloumenon Barsabban\)</i></b>. Not otherwise known unless he is a<br>
 brother of Joseph Barsabbas of <!-#-->1:23, an early follower of<br>
 Jesus. The other, Silas, is probably a shortened form of Silvanus<br>
 <b><i>(\Silouanos\, <!-#-->1Pe 5:12)</i></b>, the companion of Paul in his second<br>
 mission tour <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:32,41; 16:25)</i></b>. <B>{Chief men}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;goumenous\)</i></b>.<br>
 Leaders, leading men <b><i>(participle from \h&#275;geomai\, to lead)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:23 <B>{And they wrote}</B> <b><i>(\grapsantes\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 participle of \graph&#333;\ and the nominative as if a principal verb<br>
 \epempsan\ had been used instead of \pempsai\, the first aorist<br>
 active infinitive <b><i>(anacoluthon)</i></b>. This committee of four <b><i>(Judas,<br>
 Silas, Barnabas, Paul)</i></b> carried the letter which embodied the<br>
 decision of the Conference. This letter is the writing out of the<br>
 judgment of James and apparently written by him as the President.<br>
 <B>{The apostles and the elders, brethren}</B> <b><i>(\hoi apostoloi kai hoi<br>
 presbuteroi, adelphoi\)</i></b>. So the oldest and best MSS. without<br>
 \kai\ <b><i>(and)</i></b> before "brethren." This punctuation is probably<br>
 correct and not "elder brethren." The inquiry had been sent to<br>
 the apostles and elders <b><i>(verse <!-#-->2)</i></b> though the whole church<br>
 joined in the welcome <b><i>(verse <!-#-->4)</i></b> and in the decision <b><i>(verse<br>
 <!-#-->22)</i></b>. The apostles and elders send the epistle, but call<br>
 themselves "brothers to brothers," _Fratres Fratibus Salutem_.<br>
 "The brothers" <b><i>(\tois adelphois\)</i></b> addressed <b><i>(dative case)</i></b> are of<br>
 the Gentiles <b><i>(\ex ethn&#333;n\)</i></b> and those in Antioch, Syria, and<br>
 Cilicia, because they were immediately involved. But the decision<br>
 of this Conference was meant for Gentile Christians everywhere<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->16:4)</i></b>. <B>{Greeting}</B> <b><i>(\Chairein\)</i></b>. The customary formula in the<br>
 beginning of letters, the absolute infinitive <b><i>(usually<br>
 \chairein\)</i></b> with the nominative absolute also as in <!-#-->Jas 1:1; Ac<br>
 23:26 and innumerable papyri <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 1902f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:24 <B>{Certain which went from us}</B> <b><i>(\tines ex h&#275;m&#333;n\, Aleph B<br>
 omit \exelthontes\)</i></b>. A direct blow at the Judaizers, put in<br>
 delicate language <b><i>(we heard \&#275;kousamen\)</i></b> as if only at Antioch<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->15:1)</i></b>, and not also in Jerusalem in open meeting <b><i>(<!-#-->15:5)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Have troubled you with words}</B> <b><i>(\etaraxan humas logois\)</i></b>. What a<br>
 picture of turmoil in the church in Antioch, words, words, words.<br>
 Aorist tense of the common verb \tarass&#333;\, to agitate, to make<br>
 the heart palpitate <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 14:1,27)</i></b> and instrumental case of<br>
 \logois\. <B>{Subverting your souls}</B> <b><i>(\anaskeuazontes tas psuchas<br>
 hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present active participle of \anaskeuaz&#333;\, old verb<br>
 <b><i>(\ana\ and \skeuos\, baggage)</i></b> to pack up baggage, to plunder, to<br>
 ravage. Powerful picture of the havoc wrought by the Judaizers<br>
 among the simple-minded Greek Christians in Antioch. <B>{To whom we<br>
 gave no commandment}</B> <b><i>(\hois ou diesteilametha\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 middle indicative of \diastell&#333;\, old verb to draw asunder, to<br>
 distinguish, to set forth distinctly, to command. This is a flat<br>
 disclaimer of the whole conduct of the Judaizers in Antioch and<br>
 in Jerusalem, a complete repudiation of their effort to impose<br>
 the Mosaic ceremonial law upon the Gentile Christians.<br>
 <br>
 15:25 <B>{It seemed good unto us}</B> <b><i>(\edoxen h&#275;min\)</i></b>. See statement by<br>
 Luke in verse <!-#-->22, and now this definite decision is in the<br>
 epistle itself. It is repeated in verse <!-#-->28. <B>{Having come to one<br>
 accord}</B> <b><i>(\genomenois homothumadon\)</i></b>. On this adverb, common in<br>
 Acts, see on &#175;1:14. But \genomenois\ clearly means that the<br>
 final unity was the result of the Conference <b><i>(private and public<br>
 talks)</i></b>. The Judaizers are here brushed to one side as the<br>
 defeated disturbers that they really were who had lacked the<br>
 courage to vote against the majority. <B>{To choose out men and send<br>
 them}</B> <b><i>(\eklexamenois andras pempsai\ A B L, though Aleph C D read<br>
 \eklexamenous\ as in verse <!-#-->22)</i></b>. Precisely the same idiom as in<br>
 verse <!-#-->22, "having chosen out to send." <B>{With our beloved<br>
 Barnabas and Paul}</B> <b><i>(\sun tois agap&#275;tois h&#275;m&#333;n Barnab&#257;i kai<br>
 Paul&#333;i\)</i></b>. The verbal adjective \agap&#275;tois\ <b><i>(common in the N.T.)</i></b><br>
 definitely sets the seal of warm approval on Barnabas and Paul.<br>
 Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 2:9)</i></b> confirms this by his statement concerning the<br>
 right hand of fellowship given.<br>
 <br>
 15:26 <B>{Have hazarded their lives}</B> <b><i>(\paraded&#333;kosi tas psuchas<br>
 aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Perfect active participle dative plural of \paradid&#333;mi\,<br>
 old word, to hand over to another, and with \psuchas\, to hand<br>
 over to another their lives. The sufferings of Paul and Barnabas<br>
 in Pisidia and Lycaonia were plainly well-known just as the story<br>
 of Judson in Burmah is today. On the use of "name" here see on<br>
 &#175;3:6.<br>
 <br>
 15:27 <B>{Who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word<br>
 of mouth}</B> <b><i>(\kai autous dia logou apaggellontas ta auta\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "they themselves also by speech announcing the same<br>
 things." The present participle, as here, sometimes is used like<br>
 the future to express purpose as in <!-#-->3:26 \eulogounta\ after<br>
 \apesteilen\ and so here \apaggellontas\ after \apestalkamen\<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1128)</i></b>. Judas and Silas are specifically<br>
 endorsed <b><i>(perfect active indicative of \apostell&#333;\)</i></b> as bearers of<br>
 the epistle who will also verbally confirm the contents of the<br>
 letter.<br>
 <br>
 15:28 <B>{To the Holy Spirit and to us}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i pneumati t&#333;i hagi&#333;i<br>
 kai h&#275;min\)</i></b>. Dative case after \edoxen\ <b><i>(third example, verses<br>
 <!-#-->22,25,28)</i></b>. Definite claim that the church in this action had<br>
 the guidance of the Holy Spirit. That fact was plain to the<br>
 church from what had taken place in Caesarea and in this campaign<br>
 of Paul and Barnabas <b><i>(verse <!-#-->8)</i></b>. Jesus had promised that the<br>
 Holy Spirit would guide them into all truth <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 16:13)</i></b>. Even<br>
 so the church deliberated carefully before deciding. What a<br>
 blessing it would be if this were always true! But even so the<br>
 Judaizers are only silenced for the present, not convinced and<br>
 only waiting for a better day to start over again. <B>{No greater<br>
 burden}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;den pleon baros\)</i></b>. The restrictions named did<br>
 constitute some burden <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mt 20:12)</i></b>, for the old word \baros\<br>
 means weight or heaviness. Morality itself is a restraint upon<br>
 one's impulses as is all law a prohibition against license.<br>
 <br>
 15:29 <B>{Than these necessary things}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;n tout&#333;n t&#333;n<br>
 epanagkes\)</i></b>. This old adverb <b><i>(from \epi\ and \anagk&#275;\)</i></b> means on<br>
 compulsion, of necessity. Here only in the N.T. For discussion of<br>
 these items see on verses <!-#-->20,21. In comparison with the freedom<br>
 won this "burden" is light and not to be regarded as a compromise<br>
 in spite of the arguments of Lightfoot and Ramsay. It was such a<br>
 concession as any converted Gentile would be glad to make even if<br>
 "things strangled" be included. This "necessity" was not a matter<br>
 of salvation but only for fellowship between Jews and Gentiles.<br>
 The Judaizers made the law of Moses essential to salvation<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->15:16)</i></b>. <B>{It shall be well with you}</B> <b><i>(\eu praxete\)</i></b>. Ye shall<br>
 fare well. A classical idiom used here effectively. The peace and<br>
 concord in the fellowship of Jews and Gentiles will justify any<br>
 slight concession on the part of the Gentiles. This letter is not<br>
 laid down as a law, but it is the judgment of the Jerusalem<br>
 Christians for the guidance of the Gentiles <b><i>(<!-#-->16:4)</i></b> and it had a<br>
 fine effect at once <b><i>(<!-#-->15:30-35)</i></b>. Trouble did come later from the<br>
 Judaizers who were really hostile to the agreement in Jerusalem,<br>
 but that opposition in no way discredits the worth of the work of<br>
 this Conference. No sane agreement will silence perpetual and<br>
 professional disturbers like these Judaizers who will seek to<br>
 unsettle Paul's work in Antioch, in Corinth, in Galatia, in<br>
 Jerusalem, in Rome. <B>{Fare ye well}</B> <b><i>(\Err&#333;sthe\)</i></b>. _Valete_.<br>
 Perfect passive imperative of \rh&#333;nnumi\, to make strong. Common<br>
 at the close of letters. Be made strong, keep well, fare well.<br>
 Here alone in the N.T. though some MSS. have it in <!-#-->23:30.<br>
 <br>
 15:30 <B>{So they}</B> <b><i>(\hoi men oun\)</i></b>. As in verse <!-#-->3. <B>{When they were<br>
 dismissed}</B> <b><i>(\apoluthentes\)</i></b>. First aorist passive participle of<br>
 \apolu&#333;\, common verb to loosen, to dismiss. Possibly <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b><br>
 religious services were held as in verse <!-#-->33 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->13:3)</i></b> and<br>
 perhaps an escort for part of the way as in verse <!-#-->3. <B>{The<br>
 multitude}</B> <b><i>(\to pl&#275;thos\)</i></b>. Public meeting of the church as in<br>
 verses <!-#-->1-3. Deissmann <b><i>(_Bible Studies_, p. 232)</i></b> gives<br>
 illustrations from the inscriptions of the use of \pl&#275;thos\ for<br>
 official, political, and religious gatherings. The committee<br>
 formally "delivered" <b><i>(\eped&#333;kan\)</i></b> the epistle to the church<br>
 authorities.<br>
 <br>
 15:31 <B>{When they had read it}</B> <b><i>(\anagnontes\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active participle of \anagin&#333;sk&#333;\. Public reading, of course, to<br>
 the church. <B>{They rejoiced}</B> <b><i>(\echar&#275;san\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> passive indicative of \chair&#333;\. They burst into<br>
 exultant joy showing clearly that they did not consider it a weak<br>
 compromise, but a glorious victory of Gentile liberty. <B>{For the<br>
 consolation}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;i parakl&#275;sei\)</i></b>. The encouragement, the cheer<br>
 in the letter. See \parekalesan\ in verse <!-#-->32. Consolation and<br>
 exhortation run into one another in this word.<br>
 <br>
 15:32 <B>{Being themselves also prophets}</B> <b><i>(\kai autoi proph&#275;tai<br>
 ontes\)</i></b>. As well as Paul and Barnabas and like Agabus<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->11:27-30)</i></b>, for-speakers for Christ who justify the<br>
 commendation in the letter <b><i>(verse <!-#-->27)</i></b> "with many words" <b><i>(\dia<br>
 logou pollou\)</i></b>, "with much talk," and no doubt with kindly words<br>
 concerning the part played at the Conference by Paul and<br>
 Barnabas. <B>{Confirmed}</B> <b><i>(\epest&#275;rixan\)</i></b>. See on &#175;14:22. It was a<br>
 glorious time with no Judaizers to disturb their fellowship as in<br>
 <!-#-->1-3.<br>
 <br>
 15:33 <B>{Some time}</B> <b><i>(\chronon\)</i></b>. Accusative after \poi&#275;santes\,<br>
 "having done time." How long we do not know.<br>
 <br>
 15:34 <B>{But it seemed good unto Silas to abide there}</B> <b><i>(\edoxe de<br>
 Sil&#257;i epimeinai autou\)</i></b>. This verse is not in the Revised Version<br>
 or in the text of Westcott and Hort, being absent from Aleph A B<br>
 Vulgate, etc. It is clearly an addition to help explain the fact<br>
 that Silas is back in Antioch in verse <!-#-->40. But the "some days"<br>
 of verse <!-#-->36 afforded abundant time for him to return from<br>
 Jerusalem. He and Judas went first to Jerusalem to make a report<br>
 of their mission.<br>
 <br>
 15:35 <B>{Tarried}</B> <b><i>(\dietribon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \diatrib&#333;\,<br>
 old verb to pass time, seen already in <!-#-->12:19; 14:3,28. <B>{With<br>
 many others also}</B> <b><i>(\meta kai heter&#333;n poll&#333;n\)</i></b>. A time of general<br>
 revival and naturally so after the victory at Jerusalem. It is at<br>
 this point that it is probable that the sad incident took place<br>
 told by Paul in <!-#-->Ga 2:11-21. Peter came up to see how things<br>
 were going in Antioch after Paul's victory in Jerusalem. At first<br>
 Peter mingled freely with the Greek Christians without the<br>
 compunctions shown at Caesarea and for which he had to answer in<br>
 Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:1-18)</i></b>. Rumours of Peter's conduct reached<br>
 Jerusalem and the Judaizers saw a chance to reopen the<br>
 controversy on the line of social customs, a matter not passed on<br>
 at the Jerusalem Conference. These Judaizers threaten Peter with<br>
 a new trial and he surrenders and is followed by Barnabas and all<br>
 the Jewish brethren in Antioch to the dismay of Paul who boldly<br>
 rebuked Peter and Barnabas and won them back to his view. It was<br>
 a crisis. Some would even date the Epistle to the Galatians at<br>
 this time also, an unlikely hypothesis.<br>
 <br>
 15:36 <B>{Let us return now and visit the brethren}</B> <b><i>(\epistrepsantes<br>
 de episkeps&#333;metha tous adelphous\)</i></b>. Paul takes the initiative as<br>
 the leader, all the more so if the rebuke to Peter and Barnabas<br>
 in <!-#-->Ga 2:11-21 had already taken place. Paul is anxious, like a<br>
 true missionary, to go back to the fields where he has planted<br>
 the gospel. He uses the hortatory subjunctive <b><i>(\episkeps&#333;metha\)</i></b><br>
 for the proposal <b><i>(see on &#175;15:14 for this verb)</i></b>. Note the<br>
 repeated \epi\ <b><i>(\epi-strepsantes\ and \episkeps&#333;metha\)</i></b>. There is<br>
 special point in the use of \d&#275;\ <b><i>(shortened form of \&#275;d&#275;\)</i></b>, now<br>
 at this juncture of affairs <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->13:2)</i></b>. <B>{How they fare}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;s<br>
 echousin\)</i></b>. Indirect question, "how they have it." The<br>
 precariousness of the life of new converts in pagan lands is<br>
 shown in all of Paul's Epistles <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. So he wanted to go<br>

 <br>
 15:37 <B>{Was minded to take with them}</B> <b><i>(\ebouleto sunparalabein\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect middle <b><i>(\ebouleto\)</i></b>, not aorist middle \ebouleusato\ of<br>
 the Textus Receptus. Barnabas willed, wished and stuck to it<br>
 <b><i>(imperfect tense)</i></b>. \Sunparalabein\ is second aorist active<br>
 infinitive of the double compound \sunparalamban&#333;\, old verb to<br>
 take along together with, used already about John Mark in <!-#-->12:25<br>
 and by Paul in <!-#-->Ga 2:1 about Titus. Nowhere else in the N.T.<br>
 Barnabas used the ingressive aorist in his suggestion.<br>
 <br>
 15:38 <B>{But Paul thought not good to take with them}</B> <b><i>(\Paulos de<br>
 &#275;xiou--m&#275; sunparalambanein touton\)</i></b>. The Greek is far more<br>
 effective than this English rendering. It is the imperfect active<br>
 of \axio&#333;\, old verb to think meet or right and the present<br>
 active infinitive of the same verb <b><i>(\sunparalamban&#333;\)</i></b> with<br>
 negative used with this infinitive. Literally, "But Paul kept on<br>
 deeming it wise not to be taking along with them this one."<br>
 Barnabas looked on it as a simple punctiliar proposal <b><i>(aorist<br>
 infinitive)</i></b>, but Paul felt a lively realization of the problem of<br>
 having a quitter on his hands <b><i>(present infinitive)</i></b>. Each was<br>
 insistent in his position <b><i>(two imperfects)</i></b>. Paul had a definite<br>
 reason for his view describing John Mark as "him who withdrew<br>
 from them from Pamphylia" <b><i>(\ton apostanta ap' aut&#333;n apo<br>
 Pamphulias\)</i></b>. Second aorist active articular participle of<br>
 \aphist&#275;mi\, intransitive use, "the one who stood off from,<br>
 apostatized from" <b><i>(our very word "apostasy")</i></b>. And also as the one<br>
 who "went not with them to the work" <b><i>(\kai m&#275; sunelthonta autois<br>
 eis to ergon\)</i></b>. At Perga Mark had faced the same task that Paul<br>
 and Barnabas did, but he flinched and flickered and quit. Paul<br>
 declined to repeat the experiment with Mark.<br>
 <br>
 15:39 <B>{A sharp contention}</B> <b><i>(\paroxusmos\)</i></b>. Our very word paroxysm<br>
 in English. Old word though only twice in the N.T. <b><i>(here and <!-#-->Heb<br>
 10:24)</i></b>, from \paroxun&#333;\, to sharpen <b><i>(\para, oxus\)</i></b> as of a blade<br>
 and of the spirit <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 17:16; 1Co 13:5)</i></b>. This "son of<br>
 consolation" loses his temper in a dispute over his cousin and<br>
 Paul uses sharp words towards his benefactor and friend. It is<br>
 often so that the little irritations of life give occasion to<br>
 violent explosions. If the incident in <!-#-->Ga 2:11-21 had already<br>
 taken place, there was a sore place already that could be easily<br>
 rubbed. And if Mark also joined with Peter and Barnabas on that<br>
 occasion, Paul had fresh ground for irritation about him. But<br>
 there is no way to settle differences about men and we can only<br>
 agree to disagree as Paul and Barnabas did. <B>{So that they parted<br>
 asunder from one another}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste apoch&#333;risth&#275;nai autous ap'<br>
 all&#275;l&#333;n\)</i></b>. Actual result here stated by \h&#333;ste\ and the first<br>
 aorist passive infinitive of \apoch&#333;riz&#333;\, old verb to sever, to<br>
 separate, here only and <!-#-->Re 6:4 in the N.T. The accusative of<br>
 general reference <b><i>(\autous\)</i></b> is normal. For construction with<br>
 \h&#333;ste\ see Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 999f. <B>{And Barnabas took<br>
 Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus}</B> <b><i>(\ton te Barnaban<br>
 paralabonta ton Markon ekpleusai eis Kupron\)</i></b>. Second infinitival<br>
 clause \ekpleusai\ after \h&#333;ste\ connected by \te\. The same<br>
 participle is used here minus \sun, paralabonta\ <b><i>(second aorist<br>
 active)</i></b>. Barnabas and Mark sailed out <b><i>(\ekpleusai\ from \ekple&#333;\)</i></b><br>
 from the harbour of Antioch. This is the last glimpse that Luke<br>
 gives us of Barnabas, one of the noblest figures in the New<br>
 Testament. Paul has a kindly reference to him in <!-#-->1Co 9:6. No<br>
 one can rightly blame Barnabas for giving his cousin John Mark a<br>
 second chance nor Paul for fearing to risk him again. One's<br>
 judgment may go with Paul, but one's heart goes with Barnabas.<br>
 And Mark made good with Barnabas, with Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 5:13)</i></b> and<br>
 finally with Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 4:10; 2Ti 4:11)</i></b>. See my little book on<br>
 John Mark <b><i>(_Making Good in the Ministry_)</i></b>. Paul and Barnabas<br>
 parted in anger and both in sorrow. Paul owed more to Barnabas<br>
 than to any other man. Barnabas was leaving the greatest spirit<br>
 of the time and of all times.<br>
 <br>
 15:40 <B>{Chose}</B> <b><i>(\epilexamenos\)</i></b>. First aorist middle <b><i>(indirect)</i></b><br>
 participle of \epileg&#333;\, choosing for himself, as the successor<br>
 of Barnabas, not of Mark who had no place in Paul's plans at this<br>
 time. <B>{Commended}</B> <b><i>(\paradotheis\)</i></b>. First aorist passive of<br>
 \paradid&#333;mi\, the same verb employed about Paul and Barnabas<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->14:26)</i></b> on their return from the first tour. It is clear now<br>
 that the sympathy of the church at Antioch is with Paul rather<br>
 than with Barnabas in the cleavage that has come. The church<br>
 probably recalled how in the pinch Barnabas flickered and went to<br>
 the side of Peter and that it was Paul who for the moment stood<br>
 _Paulus contra mundum_ for Gentile liberty in Christ against the<br>
 threat of the Judaizers from Jerusalem. Silas had influence in<br>
 the church in Jerusalem <b><i>(verse <!-#-->22)</i></b> and was apparently a Roman<br>
 citizen <b><i>(<!-#-->16:37)</i></b> also. He is the Silas or Silvanus of the<br>
 epistles <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 1:1; 2Th 1:1; 2Co 1:19; 1Pe 5:12)</i></b>. It is<br>
 remarkable that Peter mentions both Mark and Silas as with him<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 5:12f.)</i></b> at the same time.<br>
 <br>
 15:41 <B>{Went through}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;rcheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle. So Paul<br>
 went forth on his second mission tour with heart-aches and high<br>
 hopes mingled together. <B>{Syria and Cilicia}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n Surian kai t&#275;n<br>
 Kilikian\)</i></b>. He took the opposite course from the first tour,<br>
 leaving Cyprus to Barnabas and Mark. Probably Paul had<br>
 established these churches while in Tarsus after leaving<br>
 Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 9:30; Ga 1:21)</i></b>. Paul would go "by the Gulf of<br>
 Issus through the Syrian Gates, a narrow road between steep rocks<br>
 and the sea, and then inland, probably past Tarsus and over Mt.<br>
 Taurus by the Cilician gates" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. This second tour will<br>
 occupy Luke's story in Acts through <!-#-->18:22.<br>
