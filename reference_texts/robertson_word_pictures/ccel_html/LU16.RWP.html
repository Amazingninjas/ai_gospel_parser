<p>16:1 <B>{Unto the disciples}</B> <b><i>(\kai pros tous math&#275;tas\)</i></b>. The three<br>
 preceding parables in chapter 15 exposed the special faults of<br>
 the Pharisees, "their hard exclusiveness, self-righteousness, and<br>
 contempt for others" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. This parable is given by Luke<br>
 alone. The \kai\ <b><i>(also)</i></b> is not translated in the Revised Version.<br>
 It seems to mean that at this same time, after speaking to the<br>
 Pharisees <b><i>(chapter 15)</i></b>, Jesus proceeds to speak a parable to the<br>
 disciples <b><i>(<!-#-->16:1-13)</i></b>, the parable of the Unjust Steward. It is a<br>
 hard parable to explain, but Jesus opens the door by the key in<br>
 verse <!-#-->9. <B>{Which had a steward}</B> <b><i>(\hos &#275;ichen oikonomon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active, continued to have. Steward is house-manager or<br>
 overseer of an estate as already seen in <!-#-->Lu 12:42. <B>{Was<br>
 accused}</B> <b><i>(\diebl&#275;th&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist indicative passive, of<br>
 \diaball&#333;\, an old verb, but here only in the N.T. It means to<br>
 throw across or back and forth, rocks or words and so to slander<br>
 by gossip. The word implies malice even if the thing said is<br>
 true. The word \diabolos\ <b><i>(slanderer)</i></b> is this same root and it is<br>
 used even of women, she-devils <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 3:11)</i></b>. <B>{That he was<br>
 wasting}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s diaskorpiz&#333;n\)</i></b>. For the verb see on &#175;15:13. The<br>
 use of \h&#333;s\ with the participle is a fine Greek idiom for giving<br>
 the alleged ground of a charge against one. <B>{His goods}</B> <b><i>(\ta<br>
 huparchonta autou\)</i></b>. "His belongings," a Lukan idiom.<br>
 <br>
 16:2 <B>{What is this that I hear?}</B> <b><i>(\ti touto akou&#333;;\)</i></b>. There are<br>
 several ways of understanding this terse Greek idiom. The Revised<br>
 Version <b><i>(above)</i></b> takes \ti\ to be equal to \ti estin touto ho<br>
 akou&#333;\; That is a possible use of the predicate \touto\. Another<br>
 way is to take \ti\ to be exclamatory, which is less likely.<br>
 Still another view is that \ti\ is " Why": "Why do I hear this<br>
 about thee?" See <!-#-->Ac 14:15 where that is the idiom employed.<br>
 <B>{Render}</B> <b><i>(\apodos\)</i></b>. Second aorist active imperative of<br>
 \apodid&#333;mi\, Give back <b><i>(and at once)</i></b>. <B>{The account}</B> <b><i>(\ton<br>
 logon\)</i></b>. The reckoning or report. Common use of \logos\.<br>
 <B>{Stewardship}</B> <b><i>(\oikonomias\)</i></b>. Same root as \oikonomos\ <b><i>(steward)</i></b>.<br>
 This demand does not necessarily mean dismissal if investigation<br>
 proved him innocent of the charges. But the reason given implies<br>
 that he is to be dismissed: <B>{Thou canst no longer}</B> <b><i>(\ou gar<br>
 dun&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:3 <B>{Within himself}</B> <b><i>(\en heaut&#333;i\)</i></b>. As soon as he had time to<br>
 think the thing over carefully. He knew that he was guilty of<br>
 embezzlement of the Master's funds. <B>{Taketh away}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aphaireitai\)</i></b>. Present <b><i>(linear)</i></b> middle indicative of<br>
 \aphaire&#333;\, old verb to take away. Here the middle present means,<br>
 He is taking away for himself. <B>{To beg I am not ashamed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epaitein aischunomai\)</i></b>. The infinitive with \aischunomai\ means<br>
 ashamed to begin to beg. The participle, \epait&#333;n aischunomai\<br>
 would mean, ashamed while begging, ashamed of begging while doing<br>
 it.<br>
 <br>
 16:4 <B>{I am resolved}</B> <b><i>(\egn&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative<br>
 of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\. A difficult tense to reproduce in English. I knew,<br>
 I know, I have known, all miss it a bit. It is a burst of<br>
 daylight to the puzzled, darkened man: I've got it, I see into it<br>
 now, a sudden solution. <B>{What to do}</B> <b><i>(\ti poi&#275;s&#333;\)</i></b>. Either<br>
 deliberative first aorist active subjunctive or deliberative<br>
 future active indicative. <B>{When I am put out}</B> <b><i>(\hotan<br>
 metastath&#333;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive subjunctive of \methist&#275;mi\,<br>
 <b><i>(\meta, hist&#275;mi\)</i></b>, old verb, to transpose, transfer, remove. He<br>
 is expecting to be put out. <B>{They may receive me}</B> <b><i>(\dex&#333;ntai\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist middle subjunctive of \dechomai\, common verb.<br>
 Subjunctive with final particle \hina\. He wishes to put the<br>
 debtors under obligation to himself. <B>{Debtors}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n<br>
 chreophilet&#333;n\)</i></b>. A late word. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 7:41<br>
 from \chreos\, loan, and \opheilet&#275;s\, debtor. It is probable<br>
 that he dealt with "each one" separately.<br>
 <br>
 16:6 <B>{Measures}</B> <b><i>(\batous\)</i></b>. Transliterated word for Hebrew<br>
 _bath_, between eight and nine gallons. Here alone in the N.T.<br>
 Not the same word as \batos\ <b><i>(<B>{bush}</B>)</i></b> in <!-#-->Lu 6:44. <B>{Thy bond}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sou ta grammata\)</i></b>. Thy writings, thy contracts, thy note.<br>
 <B>{Quickly}</B> <b><i>(\tache&#333;s\)</i></b>. It was a secret arrangement and speed was<br>
 essential.<br>
 <br>
 16:7 <B>{Measures}</B> <b><i>(\korous\)</i></b>. Another Hebrew word for dry measure.<br>
 The Hebrew _cor_ was about ten bushels. Data are not clear about<br>
 the Hebrew measures whether liquid <b><i>(<B>{bath}</B>)</i></b> or dry <b><i>(<B>{cor}</B>)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:8 <B>{His lord commended}</B> <b><i>(\ep&#275;inesen ho kurios\)</i></b>. The steward's<br>
 lord praised him though he himself had been wronged again <b><i>(see<br>
 verse <!-#-->1 "wasting his goods")</i></b>. <B>{The unrighteous steward}</B> <b><i>(\ton<br>
 oikonomon t&#275;s adikias\)</i></b>. Literally, the steward of<br>
 unrighteousness. The genitive is the case of genus, species, the<br>
 steward distinguished by unrighteousness as his characteristic.<br>
 See "the mammon of unrighteousness" in verse <!-#-->9. See "the<br>
 forgetful hearer" in <!-#-->Jas 1:25. It is a vernacular idiom common<br>
 to Hebrew, Aramaic, and the _Koin&#275;_. <B>{Wisely}</B> <b><i>(\phronim&#333;s\)</i></b>. An<br>
 old adverb, though here alone in the N.T. But the adjective<br>
 \phronimos\ from which it comes occurs a dozen times as in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 10:16. It is from \phrone&#333;\ and that from \phr&#275;n\, the mind<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 14:20)</i></b>, the discerning intellect. Perhaps "shrewdly" or<br>
 "discreetly" is better here than "wisely." The lord does not<br>
 absolve the steward from guilt and he was apparently dismissed<br>
 from his service. His shrewdness consisted in finding a place to<br>
 go by his shrewdness. He remained the steward of unrighteousness<br>
 even though his shrewdness was commended. <B>{For}</B> <b><i>(\hoti\)</i></b>.<br>
 Probably by this second \hoti\ Jesus means to say that he cites<br>
 this example of shrewdness because it illustrates the point.<br>
 "This is the moral of the whole parable. Men of the world in<br>
 their dealings with men like themselves are more prudent than the<br>
 children of light in their intercourse with one another"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. We all know how stupid Christians can be in their<br>
 co-operative work in the kingdom of God, to go no further. <B>{Wiser<br>
 than}</B> <b><i>(\phronim&#333;teroi huper\)</i></b>. Shrewder beyond, a common Greek<br>
 idiom.<br>
 <br>
 16:9 <B>{By the mammon of unrighteousness}</B> <b><i>(\ek tou mam&#333;n&#257; t&#275;s<br>
 adikias\)</i></b>. By the use of what is so often evil <b><i>(money)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Mt<br>
 6:24 mammon is set over against God as in <!-#-->Lu 16:13 below.<br>
 Jesus knows the evil power in money, but servants of God have to<br>
 use it for the kingdom of God. They should use it discreetly and<br>
 it is proper to make friends by the use of it. <B>{When it shall<br>
 fail}</B> <b><i>(\hotan eklip&#275;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist active subjunctive with<br>
 \hotan\, future time. The mammon is sure to fail. <B>{That they may<br>
 receive you into the eternal tabernacles}</B> <b><i>(\hina dex&#333;ntai humas<br>
 eis tas ai&#333;nious sk&#275;nas\)</i></b>. This is the purpose of Christ in<br>
 giving the advice about their making friends by the use of money.<br>
 The purpose is that those who have been blessed and helped by the<br>
 money may give a welcome to their benefactors when they reach<br>
 heaven. There is no thought here of purchasing an entrance into<br>
 heaven by the use of money. That idea is wholly foreign to the<br>
 context. These friends will give a hearty welcome when one gives<br>
 him mammon here. The wise way to lay up treasure in heaven is to<br>
 use one's money for God here on earth. That will give a cash<br>
 account there of joyful welcome, not of purchased entrance.<br>
 <br>
 16:10 <B>{Faithful in a very little}</B> <b><i>(\pistos en elachist&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Elative superlative. One of the profoundest sayings of Christ. We<br>
 see it in business life. The man who can be trusted in a very<br>
 small thing will be promoted to large responsibilities. That is<br>
 the way men climb to the top. Men who embezzle in large sums<br>
 began with small sums. Verses <!-#-->10-13 here explain the point of<br>
 the preceding parables.<br>
 <br>
 16:11 <B>{Faithful in the unrighteous mammon}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i adik&#333;i<br>
 mam&#333;n&#257;i\)</i></b>. In the use of what is considered "unrighteous" as it<br>
 so often is. Condition of the first class, "if ye did not prove<br>
 to be" <b><i>(\ei ouk egenesthe\)</i></b>. Failure here forfeits confidence in<br>
 "the true riches" <b><i>(\to al&#275;thinon\)</i></b>. There is no sadder story than<br>
 to see a preacher go down by the wrong use of money, caught in<br>
 this snare of the devil.<br>
 <br>
 16:12 <B>{That which is your own}</B> <b><i>(\to h&#8211;meteron\)</i></b>. But Westcott and<br>
 Hort read \to h&#275;meteron\ <b><i>(our own)</i></b> because of B L Origen. The<br>
 difference is due to itacism in the pronunciation of \h&#8211;-\ and<br>
 \h&#275;\ alike <b><i>(long \i\)</i></b>. But the point in the passage calls for<br>
 "yours" as correct. Earthly wealth is ours as a loan, a trust,<br>
 withdrawn at any moment. It belongs to another <b><i>(\en t&#333;i<br>
 allotri&#333;i\)</i></b>. If you did not prove faithful in this, who will give<br>
 you what is really yours forever? Compare "rich toward God" <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 12:21)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:13 <B>{Servant}</B> <b><i>(\oiket&#275;s\)</i></b>. Household <b><i>(\oikos\)</i></b> servant. This is<br>
 the only addition to <!-#-->Mt 6:24 where otherwise the language is<br>
 precisely the same, which see. Either Matthew or Luke has put the<br>
 \logion\ in the wrong place or Jesus spoke it twice. It suits<br>
 perfectly each context. There is no real reason for objecting to<br>
 repetition of favourite sayings by Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 16:14 <B>{Who were lovers of money}</B> <b><i>(\philarguroi huparchontes\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, being lovers of money. \Philarguroi\ is an old word,<br>
 but in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->2Ti 3:2. It is from \philos\ and<br>
 \arguros\. <B>{Heard}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kouon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, were listening<br>
 <b><i>(all the while Jesus was talking to the disciples <b><i>(verses<br>
 <!-#-->1-13)</i></b>. <B>{And they scoffed at him}</B> (\kai exemukt&#275;rizon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active again of \ekmukt&#275;riz&#333;\. LXX where late writers<br>
 use simple verb. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 23:35. It means<br>
 to turn out or up the nose at one, to sneer, to scoff. The Romans<br>
 had a phrase, _naso adunco suspendere_, to hang on the hooked<br>
 nose <b><i>(the subject of ridicule)</i></b>. These money-loving Pharisees were<br>
 quick to see that the words of Jesus about the wise use of money<br>
 applied to them. They had stood without comment the three<br>
 parables aimed directly at them <b><i>(the lost sheep, the lost coin,<br>
 the lost son)</i></b>. But now they do not remain quiet while they hear<br>
 the fourth parable spoken to the disciples. No words were<br>
 apparently spoken, but their eyes, noses, faces were eloquent<br>
 with a fine disdain.<br>
 <br>
 16:15 <B>{That justify yourselves}</B> <b><i>(\hoi dikaiountes heautous\)</i></b>.<br>
 They were past-masters at that and were doing it now by upturned<br>
 noses. <B>{An abomination in the sight of God}</B> <b><i>(\bdelugma en&#333;pion<br>
 tou theou\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 24:15; Mr 13:14 for this LXX word for a<br>
 detestable thing as when Antiochus Epiphanes set up an altar to<br>
 Zeus in place of that to Jehovah. There is withering scorn in the<br>
 use of this phrase by Jesus to these pious pretenders.<br>
 <br>
 16:16 <B>{Entereth violently into it}</B> <b><i>(\eis aut&#275;n biazetai\)</i></b>. A<br>
 corresponding saying occurs in <!-#-->Mt 11:12 in a very different<br>
 context. In both the verb \biazetai\, occurs also, but nowhere<br>
 else in the N.T. It is present middle here and can be middle or<br>
 passive in Matthew, which see. It is rare in late prose.<br>
 Deissmann <b><i>(_Bible Studies_, p. 258)</i></b> cites an inscription where<br>
 \biazomai\ is reflexive middle and used absolutely. Here the<br>
 meaning clearly is that everyone forces his way into the kingdom<br>
 of God, a plea for moral enthusiasm and spiritual passion and<br>
 energy that some today affect to despise.<br>
 <br>
 16:17 <B>{One tittle}</B> <b><i>(\mian kerean\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 5:18.<br>
 <br>
 16:18 <B>{Committeth adultery}</B> <b><i>(\moicheuei\)</i></b>. Another repeated<br>
 saying of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:32; Mr 10:11f.; Mt 19:9f.)</i></b>. Adultery<br>
 remains adultery, divorce or no divorce, remarriage or no<br>
 marriage.<br>
 <br>
 16:19 <B>{He was clothed}</B> <b><i>(\enedidusketo\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of<br>
 \endidusk&#333;\, a late intensive form of \endu&#333;\. He clothed himself<br>
 in or with. It was his habit. <B>{Purple}</B> <b><i>(\porphuran\)</i></b>. This purple<br>
 dye was obtained from the purple fish, a species of mussel or<br>
 \murex\ <b><i>(1Macc. 4:23)</i></b>. It was very costly and was used for the<br>
 upper garment by the wealthy and princes <b><i>(royal purple)</i></b>. They had<br>
 three shades of purple <b><i>(deep violet, deep scarlet or crimson,<br>
 deep blue)</i></b>. See also <!-#-->Mr 15:17,20; Re 18:12. <B>{Fine linen}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\busson\)</i></b>. <B>{Byssus}</B> or Egyptian flax <b><i>(India and Achaia also)</i></b>. It<br>
 is a yellowed flax from which fine linen was made for<br>
 undergarments. It was used for wrapping mummies. "Some of the<br>
 Egyptian linen was so fine that it was called _woven air_"<br>
 <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. Here only in the N.T. for the adjective \bussinos\<br>
 occurs in <!-#-->Re 18:12; 19:8,14. <B>{Faring sumptuously}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\euphrainomenos lampr&#333;s\)</i></b>. <B>{Making merry brilliantly}</B>. The verb<br>
 \euphrainomai\ we have already had in <!-#-->12:19; 15:23,25,32.<br>
 \Lampr&#333;s\ is an old adverb from \lampros\, brilliant, shining,<br>
 splendid, magnificent. It occurs here only in the N.T. This<br>
 parable apparently was meant for the Pharisees <b><i>(verse <!-#-->14)</i></b> who<br>
 were lovers of money. It shows the wrong use of money and<br>
 opportunity.<br>
 <br>
 16:20 <B>{Beggar}</B> <b><i>(\pt&#333;chos\)</i></b>. Original meaning of this old word.<br>
 See on &#175;Mt 5:3. The name Lazarus is from \Eleazaros\, "God a<br>
 help," and was a common one. _Lazar_ in English means one<br>
 afflicted with a pestilential disease. <B>{Was laid}</B> <b><i>(\ebebl&#275;to\)</i></b>.<br>
 Past perfect passive of the common verb \ball&#333;\. He had been<br>
 flung there and was still there, "as if contemptuous roughness is<br>
 implied" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{At his gate}</B> <b><i>(\pros ton pul&#333;na autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Right in front of the large portico or gateway, not necessarily a<br>
 part of the grand house, porch in <!-#-->Mt 26:71. <B>{Full of sores}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\heilk&#333;menos\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of \helko&#333;\, to make<br>
 sore, to ulcerate, from \helkos\, ulcer <b><i>(Latin _ulcus_)</i></b>. See use<br>
 of \helkos\ in verse <!-#-->21. Common in Hippocrates and other<br>
 medical writers. Here only in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 16:21 <B>{With the crumbs that fell}</B> <b><i>(\apo t&#333;n piptont&#333;n\)</i></b>. From the<br>
 things that fell from time to time. The language reminds one of<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 15:16 <b><i>(the prodigal son)</i></b> and the Syro-Phoenician woman <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 7:28)</i></b>. Only it does not follow that this beggar did not get the<br>
 scraps from the rich man's table. Probably he did, though nothing<br>
 more. Even the wild street dogs would get them also. <B>{Yea, even<br>
 the dogs}</B> <b><i>(\alla kai hoi kunes\)</i></b>. For \alla kai\ see also <!-#-->12:7;<br>
 24:22. \Alla\ can mean "yea," though it often means "but." Here<br>
 it depends on how one construes Luke's meaning. If he means that<br>
 he was dependent on casual scraps and it was so bad that even the<br>
 wild dogs moreover were his companions in misery, the climax came<br>
 that he was able to drive away the dogs. The other view is that<br>
 his hunger was unsatisfied, but even the dogs increased his<br>
 misery. <B>{Licked his sores}</B> <b><i>(\epeleichon ta helk&#275; autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active of \epileich&#333;\, a late vernacular _Koin&#275;_ verb,<br>
 to lick over the surface. It is not clear whether the licking of<br>
 the sores by the dogs added to the misery of Lazarus or gave a<br>
 measure of comfort, as he lay in his helpless condition. "Furrer<br>
 speaks of witnessing dogs and lepers waiting together for the<br>
 refuse" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. It was a scramble between the dogs and Lazarus.<br>
 <br>
 16:22 <B>{Was borne}</B> <b><i>(\apenechth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 infinitive from \apopher&#333;\, a common compound defective verb. The<br>
 accusative case of general reference <b><i>(\auton\)</i></b> is common with the<br>
 infinitive in such clauses after \egeneto\, like indirect<br>
 discourse. It is his soul, of course, that was so borne by the<br>
 angels, not his body. <B>{Into Abraham's bosom}</B> <b><i>(\eis ton holpon<br>
 Abraam\)</i></b>. To be in Abraham's bosom is to the Jew to be in<br>
 Paradise. In <!-#-->Joh 1:18 the Logos is in the bosom of the Father.<br>
 Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are in heaven and welcome those who<br>
 come <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 8:11; 4Macc. 14:17)</i></b>. The beloved disciple reclined on<br>
 the bosom of Jesus at the last passover <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 13:23)</i></b> and this<br>
 fact indicates special favour. So the welcome to Lazarus was<br>
 unusual. <B>{Was buried}</B> <b><i>(\etaph&#275;\)</i></b>. Second aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b><br>
 passive of the common verb \thapt&#333;\. Apparently in contrast with<br>
 the angelic visitation to the beggar.<br>
 <br>
 16:23 <B>{In Hades}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i H&#257;id&#275;i\)</i></b>. See on <!-#-->Mt 16:18 for<br>
 discussion of this word. Lazarus was in Hades also for both<br>
 Paradise <b><i>(Abraham's bosom)</i></b> and Gehenna are in the unseen world<br>
 beyond the grave. <B>{In torments}</B> <b><i>(\en basanois\)</i></b>. The touchstone<br>
 by which gold and other metals were tested, then the rack for<br>
 torturing people. Old word, but in the N.T. only here, <!-#-->Lu 16:28;<br>
 Mt 4:24. <B>{Sees}</B> <b><i>(\hor&#257;i\)</i></b>. Dramatic present indicative. The Jews<br>
 believed that Gehenna and Paradise were close together. This<br>
 detail in the parable does not demand that we believe it. The<br>
 picture calls for it. <B>{From afar}</B> <b><i>(\apo makrothen\)</i></b>. Pleonastic<br>
 use of \apo\ as \makrothen\ means <B>{from afar}</B>.<br>
 <br>
 16:24 <B>{That he may dip}</B> <b><i>(\hina baps&#275;i\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 subjunctive of \bapt&#333;\, common verb, to dip. <B>{In water}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hudatos\)</i></b>. Genitive, the specifying case, water and not<br>
 something else. <B>{Cool}</B> <b><i>(\katapsux&#275;i\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 subjunctive of \katapsuch&#333;\, a late Greek compound, to cool off,<br>
 to make cool. Only here in the N.T. but common in medical books.<br>
 Note perfective use of \kata-\ <b><i>(down)</i></b>. A small service that will<br>
 be welcome. <B>{For I am in anguish}</B> <b><i>(\hoti odun&#333;mai\)</i></b>. The active<br>
 has a causative sense to cause intense pain, the middle to<br>
 torment oneself <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:48; Ac 20:38)</i></b>, the passive to be<br>
 translated as here. Common verb, but no other examples in the<br>
 N.T.<br>
 <br>
 16:25 <B>{Receivedst}</B> <b><i>(\apelabes\)</i></b>. Second aorist indicative of<br>
 \apolamban&#333;\, old verb to get back what is promised and in full.<br>
 See also <!-#-->Lu 6:34; 18:30; 23:41. <B>{Evil things}</B> <b><i>(\ta kaka\)</i></b>. Not<br>
 "his," but "the evil things" that came upon him. <B>{Thou art in<br>
 anguish}</B> <b><i>(\odun&#257;sai\)</i></b>. Like \kauch&#257;sai\ in <!-#-->Ro 2:17. They<br>
 contracted \-aesai\ without the loss of \s\. Common in the<br>
 _Koin&#275;_.<br>
 <br>
 16:26 <B>{Beside all this}</B> <b><i>(\en p&#257;si toutois\)</i></b>. <B>{In all these<br>
 things}</B> <b><i>(or regions)</i></b>. <B>{Gulf}</B> <b><i>(\chasma\)</i></b>. An old word from<br>
 \chain&#333;\, to yawn, our chasm, a gaping opening. Only here in the<br>
 N.T. <B>{Is fixed}</B> <b><i>(\est&#275;riktai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative of<br>
 \st&#275;riz&#333;\, old verb <b><i>(see on &#175;Lu 9:51)</i></b>. Permanent chasm. <B>{May not<br>
 be able}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; dun&#333;ntai\)</i></b>. Present middle subjunctive of<br>
 \dunamai\. The chasm is there on purpose <b><i>(<B>{that not}</B>, \hop&#333;s m&#275;\)</i></b><br>
 to prevent communication.<br>
 <br>
 16:27 <B>{That you send him}</B> <b><i>(\hina pemps&#275;is auton\)</i></b>. As if he had<br>
 not had a fair warning and opportunity. The Roman Catholics<br>
 probably justify prayer to saints from this petition from the<br>
 Rich Man to Abraham, but both are in Hades <b><i>(the other world)</i></b>. It<br>
 is to be observed besides, that Abraham makes no effort to<br>
 communicate with the five brothers. But heavenly recognition is<br>
 clearly assumed. Dante has a famous description of his visit to<br>
 the damned <b><i>(_Purg_. iii, 114)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:28 <B>{That he may testify}</B> <b><i>(\hop&#333;s diamartur&#275;tai\)</i></b>. An old verb<br>
 for solemn and thorough <b><i>(\dia-\)</i></b> witness. The Rich Man labours<br>
 under the delusion that his five brothers will believe the<br>
 testimony of Lazarus as a man from the dead.<br>
 <br>
 16:29 <B>{Let them hear them}</B> <b><i>(\akousat&#333;san aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Even the<br>
 heathen have the evidence of nature to show the existence of God<br>
 as Paul argues in Romans so that they are without excuse <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro<br>
 1:20f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:30 <B>{They will repent}</B> <b><i>(\metano&#275;sousin\)</i></b>. The Rich Man had<br>
 failed to do this and he now sees that it is the one thing<br>
 lacking. It is not wealth, not poverty, not alms, not influence,<br>
 but repentance that is needed. He had thought repentance was for<br>
 others, not for all.<br>
 <br>
 16:31 <B>{Neither will they be persuaded}</B> <b><i>(\oud' peisth&#275;sontai\)</i></b>.<br>
 First future passive of \peith&#333;\. Gressmann calls attention to<br>
 the fact that Jesus is saying this in the conclusion of the<br>
 parable. It is a sharp discouragement against efforts today to<br>
 communicate with the dead. "Saul was not led to repentance when<br>
 he saw Samuel at Endor nor were the Pharisees when they saw<br>
 Lazarus come forth from the tomb. The Pharisees tried to put<br>
 Lazarus to death and to explain away the resurrection of Jesus"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. Alford comments on the curious fact that Lazarus was<br>
 the name of the one who did rise from the dead but whose return<br>
 from the dead "was the immediate exciting cause of their<br>
 <b><i>(Pharisees)</i></b> crowning act of unbelief."<br>
