 <HR>
<p>23:1 <B>{The whole company}</B> <b><i>(\hapan to pl&#275;thos\)</i></b>. All but 
  Nicodemus<br>
  and Joseph of Arimathea who were probably not invited to this<br>
  meeting.<br>
  <br>
  23:2 <B>{Began to accuse}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rxanto kat&#275;gorein\)</i></b>. They went 
  at it<br>
  and kept it up. Luke mentions three, but neither of them includes<br>
  their real reason nor do they mention their own condemnation of<br>
  Jesus. They had indulged their hatred in doing it, but they no<br>
  longer have the power of life and death. Hence they say nothing<br>
  to Pilate of that. <B>{We found}</B> <b><i>(\heuramen\)</i></b>. Second aorist 
  active<br>
  indicative with first aorist vowel \a\. Probably they mean that<br>
  they had caught Jesus in the act of doing these things <b><i>(_in<br>
  flagrante delicto_)</i></b> rather than discovery by formal trial.<br>
  <B>{Perverting our nation}</B> <b><i>(\diastrephonta to ethnos h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
  Present active participle of \diastreph&#333;\, old verb to turn this<br>
  way and that, distort, disturb. In the N.T. only here and 
  <!-#-->
  Ac<br>
  13:10. The Sanhedrin imply that the great popularity of Jesus<br>
  was seditious. <B>{Forbidding to give tribute to Caesar}</B>, <b><i>(\k&#333;luonta<br>
  phorous kaisari didonai\)</i></b>. Note object infinitive \didonai\ after<br>
  the participle \k&#333;luonta\. Literally, hindering giving tribute to<br>
  Caesar. This was a flat untruth. Their bright young students had<br>
  tried desperately to get Jesus to say this very thing, but they<br>
  had failed utterly <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  Lu 20:25)</i></b>. <B>{Saying that he himself is<br>
  Christ a king}</B> <b><i>(\legonta hauton Christon basilea einai\)</i></b>. 
  Note<br>
  the indirect discourse here after the participle \legonta\ with<br>
  the accusative <b><i>(\hauton\ where \auton\ could have been used)</i></b>, 
  and<br>
  the infinitive. This charge is true, but not in the sense meant<br>
  by them. Jesus did claim to be the Christ and the king of the<br>
  kingdom of God. But the Sanhedrin wanted Pilate to think that he<br>
  set himself up as a rival to Caesar. Pilate would understand<br>
  little from the word "Christ," but "King" was a different matter.<br>
  He was compelled to take notice of this charge else he himself<br>
  would be accused to Caesar of winking at such a claim by Jesus.<br>
  <br>
  23:3 <B>{Thou sayest}</B> <b><i>(\su legeis\)</i></b>. A real affirmative as 
  in<br>
  <!-#-->
  22:70. The Gospels all give Pilate's question about Jesus<br>
  asking of the Jews in precisely the same words <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  Mr 15:2; Mt<br>
  27:11; Lu 23:3; Joh 18:33)</i></b>.<br>
  <br>
  23:4 <B>{The multitude}</B> <b><i>(\tous ochlous\)</i></b>. The first mention 
  of them.<br>
  It is now after daybreak. The procession of the Sanhedrin would<br>
  draw a crowd <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b> and some may have come to ask for the<br>
  release of a prisoner <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  Mr 15:8)</i></b>. There was need of haste if the<br>
  condemnation went through before friends of Jesus came. <B>{I find<br>
  no fault}</B> <b><i>(\ouden heurisk&#333; aition\)</i></b>. In the N.T. Luke alone 
  uses<br>
  this old adjective \aitios\ <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  Lu 23:4,14,22; Ac 19:40)</i></b> except<br>
  <!-#-->
  Heb. 5:9. It means one who is the author, the cause of or<br>
  responsible for anything. Luke does not give the explanation of<br>
  this sudden decision of Pilate that Jesus is innocent. Evidently<br>
  he held a careful examination before he delivered his judgment on<br>
  the case. That conversation is given in 
  <!-#-->
  Joh 18:33-38. Pilate<br>
  took Jesus inside the palace from the upper gallery <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  Joh 18:33)</i></b><br>
  and then came out and rendered his decision to the Sanhedrin<br>
  <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  Joh 18:38)</i></b> who would not go into the palace of Pilate <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  Joh<br>
  18:28)</i></b>.<br>
  <br>
  23:5 <B>{But they were the more urgent}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de epischuon\)</i></b>.<br>
  Imperfect active of \epischu&#333;\, to give added <b><i>(\epi\)</i></b> strength<br>
  <b><i>(\ischu&#333;\)</i></b>. And they kept insisting. Evidently Pilate had taken<br>
  the thing too lightly. <B>{He stirred up the people}</B> <b><i>(\anaseiei ton<br>
  laon\)</i></b>. This compound is rare, though old <b><i>(Thucydides)</i></b>, 
  to shake<br>
  up <b><i>(back and forth)</i></b>. This is a more vigorous repetition of the<br>
  first charge <b><i>(verse 
  <!-#-->
  2, "perverting our nation")</i></b>. <B>{Beginning<br>
  from Galilee}</B> <b><i>(\arxamenos apo t&#275;s Galilaias\)</i></b>. These very 
  words<br>
  occur in the address of Peter to the group in the house of<br>
  Cornelius <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  Ac 10:37)</i></b>. The idiomatic use of \arxamenos\ appears<br>
  also in 
  <!-#-->
  Ac 1:22. Galilee <b><i>(Grote)</i></b> was the mother of seditious<br>
  men <b><i>(see Josephus)</i></b>.<br>
  <br>
  23:6 <B>{A Galilean}</B> <b><i>(\Galilaios\)</i></b>. If so, here was a way 
  out for<br>
  Herod without going back on his own decision.<br>
  <br>
  23:7 <B>{When he knew}</B> <b><i>(\epignous\)</i></b>. Second aorist active 
  participle<br>
  from \epigin&#333;sk&#333;\, having gained full <b><i>(\epi\, added knowledge)</i></b>.<br>
  <B>{Of Herod's jurisdiction}</B> <b><i>(\ek t&#275;s exousias H&#275;r&#333;idou\)</i></b>. 
  Herod was<br>
  naturally jealous of any encroachment by Pilate, the Roman<br>
  Procurator of Judea. So here was a chance to respect the<br>
  prerogative <b><i>(\exousia\)</i></b> of Herod and get rid of this troublesome<br>
  case also. <B>{Sent him up}</B> <b><i>(\anepempsen\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
  indicative of \anapemp&#333;\. This common verb is used of sending<br>
  back as in verse 
  <!-#-->
  11 or of sending up to a higher court as of<br>
  Paul to Caesar <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  Ac 25:21)</i></b>. <B>{Who himself also was}</B> <b><i>(\onta kai<br>
  auton\)</i></b>. Being also himself in Jerusalem. Present active<br>
  participle of \eimi\.<br>
  <br>
  23:8 <B>{Was exceeding glad}</B> <b><i>(\echar&#275; lian\)</i></b>. Second aorist 
  passive<br>
  indicative of \chair&#333;\, ingressive aorist, became glad. <B>{Of a<br>
  long time}</B> <b><i>(\ex hikan&#333;n chron&#333;n\)</i></b>. For this idiom see 
  <!-#-->
  8:27;<br>
  20:9; Ac 8:11). <B>{He hoped}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;lpizen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. 
  He was<br>
  still hoping. He had long ago gotten over his fright that Jesus<br>
  was John the Baptist come to life again <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  9:7-9)</i></b>. <B>{Done}</B><br>
  <b><i>(\ginomenon\)</i></b>. Present middle participle. He wanted to see a<br>
  miracle happening like a stunt of a sleight-of-hand performer.<br>
  <br>
  23:9 <B>{He questioned}</B> <b><i>(\ep&#275;r&#333;t&#257;\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, kept 
  on<br>
  questioning. <B>{In many words}</B> <b><i>(\en logois hikanois\)</i></b>. Same 
  use of<br>
  \hikanos\ as in verse 
  <!-#-->
  8.<br>
  <br>
  23:10 <B>{Stood}</B> <b><i>(\hist&#275;keisan\)</i></b>. Second perfect active intransitive<br>
  of \hist&#275;mi\ with sense of imperfect. They stood by while Herod<br>
  quizzed Jesus and when he refused to answer, they broke loose<br>
  with their accusations like a pack of hounds with full voice<br>
  <b><i>(\euton&#333;s\, adverb from adjective \eutonos\, from \eu\, well, and<br>
  \tein&#333;\, to stretch, well tuned)</i></b>. Old word, but in the N.T. only<br>
  here and 
  <!-#-->
  Ac 18:28.<br>
  <br>
  23:11 <B>{Set him at nought}</B> <b><i>(\exouthen&#275;sas\)</i></b>. First aorist 
  active<br>
  participle from \exouthene&#333;\, to count as nothing, to treat with<br>
  utter contempt, as zero. <B>{Arraying him in gorgeous apparel}</B><br>
  <b><i>(\peribal&#333;n esth&#275;ta lampran\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle 
  of<br>
  \periball&#333;\, to fling around one. \Lampran\ is brilliant, shining<br>
  as in 
  <!-#-->
  Jas 2:2, so different from the modest dress of the<br>
  Master. This was part of the shame.<br>
  <br>
  23:12 <B>{For before they were at enmity between themselves}</B><br>
  <b><i>(\proup&#275;rchon gar en echthr&#257;i ontes pros heautous\)</i></b>. A<br>
  periphrastic imperfect of the double compound \prouperch&#333;\, an<br>
  old verb, to exist <b><i>(\huparch&#333;\)</i></b> previously <b><i>(\pro-\)</i></b>, 
  here alone<br>
  in the N.T., with \ontes\ <b><i>(participle of \eimi\)</i></b> added.<br>
  <br>
  23:13 <B>{Called together}</B> <b><i>(\sunkalesamenos\)</i></b>. First aorist 
  middle<br>
  participle <b><i>(to himself)</i></b>. Pilate included "the people" in the hope<br>
  that Jesus might have some friends among them.<br>
  <br>
  23:14 <B>{As one that perverteth the people}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s apostrephonta ton<br>
  laon\)</i></b>. Pilate here condenses the three charges in verse 
  <!-#-->
  2 into<br>
  one <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. He uses a more common compound of \streph&#333;\ here,<br>
  \apostreph&#333;\, to turn away from, to seduce, to mislead, whereas<br>
  \diastreph&#333;\ in verse 
  <!-#-->
  2 has more the notion of disturbing<br>
  <b><i>(turning this way and that)</i></b>. Note the use of \h&#333;s\ with the<br>
  particle, the alleged reason. Pilate understands the charge<br>
  against Jesus to be that he is a revolutionary agitator and a<br>
  dangerous rival to Caesar, treason in plain words. <B>{Having<br>
  examined him before you}</B> <b><i>(\en&#333;pion hum&#333;n anakrinas\)</i></b>. Right<br>
  before your eyes I have given him a careful examination <b><i>(\ana\)</i></b><br>
  up and down, \krin&#333;\, to judge, sift. Old and common verb in the<br>
  general sense and in the forensic sense as here and which Luke<br>
  alone has in the N.T. <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  Lu 23:14; 4:9; 12:19; 28:18; Ac 24:8)</i></b><br>
  except 
  <!-#-->
  1Co 9:3. <B>{Whereof}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;n\)</i></b>. Attraction of the relative<br>
  \ha\ to the case <b><i>(genitive)</i></b> of the unexpressed antecedent<br>
  \tout&#333;n\.<br>
  <br>
  23:15 <B>{No nor yet}</B> <b><i>(\all' oude\)</i></b>. But not even. <B>{Hath 
  been done<br>
  by him}</B> <b><i>(\estin pepragmenon aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Periphrastic perfect 
  passive<br>
  indicative of \prass&#333;\, common verb, to do. The case of \aut&#333;i\<br>
  can be regarded as either the dative or the instrumental<br>
  <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 534,542)</i></b>.<br>
  <br>
  23:16 <B>{Chastise}</B> <b><i>(\paideusas\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle 
  of<br>
  \paideu&#333;\, to train a child <b><i>(\pais\)</i></b>, and then, as a part of the<br>
  training, punishment. Our English word chasten is from the Latin<br>
  _castus_, pure, chaste, and means to purify <b><i>(cf. 
  <!-#-->
  Heb 12:6f.)</i></b>.<br>
  Perhaps Pilate may have split a hair over the word as Wycliff<br>
  puts it: "I shall deliver him amended." But, if Jesus was<br>
  innocent, Pilate had no doubt to "chastise" him to satisfy a mob.<br>
  Verse 
  <!-#-->
  17 is omitted by Westcott and Hort as from 
  <!-#-->
  Mr 15:6; Mt<br>
  27:15.<br>
  <br>
  23:18 <B>{All together}</B> <b><i>(\panpl&#275;thei\)</i></b>. An adverb from the

  If<br>
  Jesus had raised insurrection against Caesar, these accusers<br>
  would have rallied to his standard. <B>{And for murder}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
  phonon\)</i></b>. They cared nought for this. In fact, the murderer was<br>
  counted a hero like bandits and gangsters today with some<br>
  sentimentalists. <B>{Was cast}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n bl&#275;theis\)</i></b>. Periphrastic 
  aorist<br>

  middle,<br>

  Barabbas was in prison "for insurrection and murder." <B>{To their<br>
  will}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i thel&#275;mati aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. This is mob law by the judge 
  who<br>
  surrenders his own power and justice to the clamour of the crowd.<br>

  23:26 <B>{They laid hold}</B> <b><i>(\epilabomenoi\)</i></b>. Second aorist 
  middle<br>
  participle of the common verb \epilamban&#333;\. The soldiers had no<br>
  scruples about taking hold of any one of themselves <b><i>(middle<br>
  voice)</i></b>.

  Cyrene. <B>{Laid on him}</B> <b><i>(\epeth&#275;kan\)</i></b>. \K\ first aorist of<br>

  Direct middle, they were smiting themselves on the breast. "In<br>
  the Gospels there is no instance of a woman being hostile to<br>
  Christ" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. Luke's Gospel is appropriately called the<br>
  Gospel of Womanhood <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  1:39-56; 2:36-38; 7:11-15, 37-50; 8:1-3;<br>
  10:38-42; 11:27; 13:11-16)</i></b>. <B>{Lamented}</B> <b><i>(\ethr&#275;noun\)</i></b>. 
  Imperfect<br>

  lament.<br>
  <br>
  23:28 <B>{Turning}</B> <b><i>(\strapheis\)</i></b>. Luke is fond of this second 
  aorist<br>
  passive participle of \streph&#333;\ <b><i>(

  Cyrenaic word. In the N.T. only here and 
  <!-#-->
  3:5. Quotation from<br>
  <!-#-->
  Ho 10:8.<br>
  <br>
  23:31 <B>{In the green tree}</B> <b><i>(\en hugr&#333;i xul&#333;i\)</i></b>. Green wood 
  is hard<br>
  to burn and so is used for the innocent. <B>{In the dry}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i<br>
  x&#275;r&#333;i\)</i></b>. Dry wood kindles easily and is a symbol for the guilty.<br>
  This common proverb has various applications. Here the point is<br>
  that if they can put Jesus to death, being who he is, what will<br>
  happen to Jerusalem when its day of judgment comes? <B>{What shall<br>
  be done}</B> <b><i>(\ti gen&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Deliberative subjunctive.<br>

  <b><i>(\anaireth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist passive infinitive of \anaire&#333;\,<br>
  old verb, to take up, to take away, to kill.<br>
  <br>
  23:33 <B>{The skull}</B> <b><i>(\to kranion\)</i></b>. Probably because it looked 
  like<br>
  a skull. See on &#175;Mt 27:33; Mr 15:22. <B>{There they crucified him}</B><br>
  <b><i>(\ekei estaur&#333;san\)</i></b>. There between the two robbers and on the<br>
  very cross on which Barabbas, the leader of the robber band, was<br>
  to have been crucified. <B>{One}</B> <b><i>(\hon men\)</i></b>, <B>{the other}</B> 
  <b><i>(\hon<br>

  <br>
  23:34 <B>{Father forgive them}</B> <b><i>(\Pater, aphes autois\)</i></b>. Second<br>
  aorist active imperative of \aphi&#275;mi\, with dative case. Some of<br>
  the oldest and best documents do not contain this verse, and yet,<br>
  while it is not certain that it is a part of Luke's Gospel, it is<br>
  certain that Jesus spoke these words, for they are utterly unlike<br>
  any one else. Jesus evidently is praying for the Roman soldiers,<br>
  who were only obeying, but not for the Sanhedrin. <B>{Cast lots}</B><br>
  <b><i>(\ebalon kl&#275;ron\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative of \ball&#333;\.<br>
  See 
  <!-#-->
  Mr 15:24; Mt 27:35.

  cast for the seamless garment, the four soldiers dividing the<br>
  other garments.<br>
  <br>
  23:35 <B>{The people stood beholding}</B> <b><i>(\hist&#275;kei\)</i></b>. Past perfect<br>
  active of \hist&#275;mi\, intransitive and like imperfect. A graphic<br>
  picture of the dazed multitude, some of whom may have been in the<br>

  Imperfect active, perhaps inchoative, began to turn up <b><i>(out,<br>
  \ex\)</i></b> at the dying Christ. The language comes from 
  <!-#-->
  Ps 22:7.<br>
  <B>{The Christ of God}</B> <b><i>(\ho Christos tou theou\)</i></b>. He had claimed 
  to<br>
  be just this <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  22:67,70)</i></b>. The sarcastic sneer <b><i>(he saved others;<br>
  let him save others, for himself he cannot save)</i></b> is in 
  <!-#-->
  Mr 15:31;<br>
  Mt 27:42. Luke alone gives the contemptuous use of \houtos\<br>
  <b><i>(this fellow)</i></b> and the fling in "the elect" <b><i>(\ho eklektos\)</i></b>. 
  These<br>
  rulers were having their day at last.<br>
  <br>
  23:36 <B>{Mocked}</B> <b><i>(\enepaixan\)</i></b>. Even the soldiers yielded 
  to the<br>
  spell and acted like boys in their jeers. Aorist tense here and<br>
  different verb also from that used of the rulers. They were not<br>
  so bitter and persistent.<br>
  <br>
  23:37 <B>{If}</B> <b><i>(\ei\)</i></b>. Condition of the first class as is text 
  in<br>
  verse 
  <!-#-->
  35 used by the rulers. The soldiers pick out "the king of<br>
  the Jews" as the point of their sneer, the point on which Jesus<br>
  was condemned. But both soldiers and rulers fail to understand<br>
  that Jesus could not save himself if he was to save others.<br>
  <br>
  23:38 <B>{A superscription}</B> <b><i>(\epigraph&#275;\)</i></b>. 
  <!-#-->
  Mr 15:26 has "the<br>
  superscription of his accusation" 
  <!-#-->
  Mt 27:37, "his accusation,"<br>
  <!-#-->
  Joh 19:19 "a title." But they all refer to the charge written<br>
  at the top on the cross giving, as was the custom, the accusation<br>
  on which the criminal was condemned, with his name and residence.<br>
  Put all the reports together and we have: This is Jesus of<br>
  Nazareth the King of the Jews. This full title appeared in Latin<br>
  for law, in Aramaic for the Jews, in Greek for everybody <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  Joh<br>
  19:20)</i></b>.<br>
  <br>
  23:39 <B>{Railed}</B> <b><i>(\eblasph&#275;mei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, implying 
  that<br>
  he kept it up. His question formally calls for an affirmative<br>
  answer <b><i>(\ouchi\)</i></b>, but the ridicule is in his own answer: "Save<br>
  thyself and us." It was on a level with an effort to break<br>
  prison. Luke alone gives this incident <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  39-43)</i></b>, though 
  <!-#-->
  Mr<br>
  15:32; Mt 27:44 allude to it.<br>
  <br>
  23:40 <B>{Rebuking}</B> <b><i>(\epitim&#333;n\)</i></b>. From what Mark and Matthew 
  say<br>
  both robbers sneered at Jesus at first, but this one came to<br>
  himself and turned on his fellow robber in a rage. <B>{Dost thou not<br>
  even fear God?}</B> <b><i>(\Oude phob&#275;i ton theon;\)</i></b>. \Oude\ here goes 
  with<br>
  the verb. \Phob&#275;i\<b><i> (second person singular present indicative<br>
  middle of \phobeomai\)</i></b>. Both of you will soon appear before God.<br>
  Jesus has nothing to answer for and you have added this to your<br>
  other sins.)<br>
  <br>
  23:41 <B>{Nothing amiss}</B> <b><i>(\ouden atopon\)</i></b>. Nothing out of 
  place <b><i>(\a\<br>
  privative, \topos\, place)</i></b>. Old word, three times in the N.T.<br>
  <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  Lu 23:44; Ac 28:6; 2Th 3:2)</i></b>. This can only mean that this<br>
  robber accepts the claims of Jesus to be true. He is dying for<br>
  claiming to be Messiah, as he is.<br>
  <br>
  23:42 <B>{In thy kingdom}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n basileian sou\, text of Westcott<br>
  and Hort or \en tei basilei&#257;i sou\, margin)</i></b>. Probably no<br>
  difference in sense is to be found, for \eis\ and \en\ are<br>
  essentially the same preposition. He refers to the Messianic rule<br>
  of Jesus and begs that Jesus will remember him. It is not clear<br>
  whether he hopes for immediate blessing or only at the judgment.<br>
  <br>
  23:43 <B>{Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise}</B> <b><i>(\S&#275;meron met'<br>
  emou es&#275;i en t&#333;i paradeis&#333;i\)</i></b>. However crude may have been the<br>
  robber's Messianic ideas Jesus clears the path for him. He<br>
  promises him immediate and conscious fellowship after death with<br>
  Christ in Paradise which is a Persian word and is used here not<br>
  for any supposed intermediate state; but the very bliss of heaven<br>
  itself. This Persian word was used for an enclosed park or<br>
  pleasure ground <b><i>(so Xenophon)</i></b>. The word occurs in two other<br>
  passages in the N.T. <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  2Co 12:4; Re 2:7)</i></b>, in both of which the<br>
  reference is plainly to heaven. Some Jews did use the word for<br>
  the abode of the pious dead till the resurrection, interpreting<br>
  "Abraham's bosom" <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  Lu 16:22f.)</i></b> in this sense also. But the<br>
  evidence for such an intermediate state is too weak to warrant<br>
  belief in it.<br>
  <br>
  23:45 <B>{The sun's light failing}</B> <b><i>(\tou h&#275;liou ekleipontos\)</i></b>.<br>
  Genitive absolute of the present active participle of \ekleip&#333;\,<br>
  an old verb, to leave out, omit, pass by, to fail, to die. The<br>
  word was used also of the eclipse of the sun or moon. But this<br>
  was impossible at this time because the moon was full at the<br>
  passover. Hence many documents change this correct text to "the<br>
  sun was darkened" <b><i>(\eskotisth&#275; ho h&#275;lios\)</i></b> to obviate the<br>
  difficulty about the technical eclipse. But the sun can be<br>
  darkened in other ways. In a London fog at noon the street lights<br>
  are often turned on. The Revised Version translates it correctly,<br>
  "the sun's light failing." Leave the darkness unexplained. <B>{In<br>
  the midst}</B> <b><i>(\meson\)</i></b>. In the middle. 
  <!-#-->
  Mr 15:38; Mt 27:51 have<br>
  "in two" <b><i>(\eis duo\)</i></b>.<br>
  <br>
  23:46 <B>{Father}</B> <b><i>(\Pater\)</i></b>. Jesus dies with the words of 
  <!-#-->
  Ps 31:5<br>
  on his lips. <B>{Gave up the ghost}</B> <b><i>(\exepneusen\)</i></b>. First 
  aorist<br>
  active indicative of \ekpne&#333;\, to breathe out, to expire, old<br>
  word, but in the N.T. only here and 
  <!-#-->
  Mr 15:37,39. There is no<br>
  special reason for retaining "ghost" in the English as both 
  <!-#-->
  Mt<br>
  27:50 <b><i>(yielded up his spirit, \aph&#275;ken to pneuma\)</i></b> and 
  <!-#-->
  Joh<br>
  19:30 <b><i>(gave up his spirit, \pared&#333;ken to pneuma\)</i></b> use \pneuma\<br>
  which is the root of \ekpne&#333;\, the verb in Mark and Luke.<br>
  <br>
  23:47 <B>{Glorified}</B> <b><i>(\edoxazen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. Began 
  to<br>
  glorify <b><i>(inchoative)</i></b> or kept on glorifying.<br>
  <br>
  23:48 <B>{Certainly}</B> <b><i>(\ont&#333;s\)</i></b>. Really, old adverb from the<br>
  participle \on\ from \eimi\, to be. Used also in 
  <!-#-->
  24:34 of the<br>
  resurrection of Jesus. <B>{A righteous man}</B> <b><i>(\dikaios\)</i></b>. 
  <!-#-->
  Mr 15:39<br>
  <b><i>(
  <!-#-->
  Mt 27:54)</i></b> which see, represents the centurion as saying \theou<br>
  huios\ <b><i>(God's Son)</i></b> which may mean to him little more than<br>
  "righteous man." <B>{That came together}</B> <b><i>(\sunparagenomenoi\)</i></b>.<br>
  Double compound <b><i>(\sun\, together, \para\, along)</i></b>, that came along<br>
  together. <B>{To this sight}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;n the&#333;rian taut&#275;n\)</i></b>. 
  This<br>
  spectacle <b><i>(\the&#333;rian\ from \the&#333;re&#333;\, verse 
  <!-#-->
  35)</i></b>. <B>{Returned}</B><br>
  <b><i>(\hupestrephon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \hupostreph&#333;\. See them<br>
  slowly wending their way back to the city from this Tragedy of<br>
  the Ages which they had witnessed in awe.<br>

  23:49 <B>{Stood afar off}</B> <b><i>(\hist&#275;keisan apo makrothen\)</i></b>. Same 
  verb<br>

  either to prevent them or to understand them. They could only<br>
  stand and look with blinded eyes.<br>
  <br>
  23:51 <B>{He had not consented to their counsel and deed}</B> <b><i>(\houtos<br>
  ouk &#275;n sunkatatetheimenos t&#275;i boul&#275;i kai t&#275;i praxei aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. This<br>
  parenthesis is given by Luke alone and explains that, though a<br>
  councillor <b><i>(\bouleut&#275;s\, 
  <!-#-->
  Mr 5:43)</i></b> he had not agreed to the vote<br>
  of the Sanhedrin. It is fairly certain that both Joseph and<br>
  Nicodemus were suspected of sympathy with Jesus and so were not<br>
  invited to the trial of Jesus. <B>{Was looking for}</B><br>
  <b><i>(\prosedecheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle. 
  <!-#-->
  Mr 15:43 has the<br>
  periphrastic imperfect <b><i>(\&#275;n prosdechomenos\)</i></b>.<br>
  <br>
  23:52 <B>{Asked for}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;it&#275;sato\)</i></b>. First aorist middle <b><i>(indirect)</i></b><br>
  indicative as in 
  <!-#-->
  Mr 15:43; Mt 27:58. The middle voice shows<br>
  that Joseph of Arimathea asked the body of Jesus as a personal<br>
  favour.<br>
  <br>
  23:53 <B>{Took it down}</B> <b><i>(\kathel&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
  participle of \kathaire&#333;\ as in 
  <!-#-->
  Mr 15:46. <B>{Wrapped}</B><br>
  <b><i>(\enetulixen\)</i></b>, as in 
  <!-#-->
  Mt 27:59 where 
  <!-#-->
  Mr 15:46 has \eneil&#275;sen\<br>
  <b><i>(wound)</i></b>, which see. 
  <!-#-->
  Joh 19:40 has "bound" <b><i>(\ed&#275;san\)</i></b>. See Matt.<br>
  and Mark also for the linen cloth <b><i>(\sindoni\)</i></b>. <B>{Hewn in stone}</B><br>
  <b><i>(\laxeut&#333;i\)</i></b>. From \laxeu&#333;\ <b><i>(\las\, a stone, \xe&#333;\, to polish)</i></b>.<br>
  In the LXX and here only in the N.T. Nowhere else so far as<br>
  known. See the usual Greek verb \latome&#333;\ in 
  <!-#-->
  Mr 15:46; Mt<br>
  27:60. <B>{Where never man had yet lain}</B> <b><i>(\hou ouk en oudeis oup&#333;<br>
  keimenos\)</i></b>. Triple negative and periphrastic past perfect passive<br>
  in sense <b><i>(\keimai\)</i></b>, though periphrastic imperfect passive in<br>
  form. Same item in 
  <!-#-->
  Joh 19:40 who uses \&#275;n tetheimenos\<br>
  <b><i>(periphrastic past perfect passive in form)</i></b>.<br>
  <br>
  23:54 <B>{The day of the Preparation}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;mera paraskeu&#275;s\)</i></b>. 
  The<br>
  technical Jewish phrase for the day before the sabbath for which<br>
  see discussion on &#175;Mt 27:62. <B>{Drew on}</B> <b><i>(\epeph&#333;sken\)</i></b>. 
  Imperfect<br>
  active, began to dawn or give light. However, it was sundown, not<br>
  sunrise when the Jewish sabbath <b><i>(twenty-four-hour day)</i></b> began. 
  The<br>
  confusion is to us, not to the Jews or the readers of the Greek<br>
  New Testament. Luke is not speaking of the twelve-hour day which<br>
  began with sunrise, but the twenty-four-hour day which began with<br>
  sunset.<br>
  <br>
  23:55 <B>{Had come with him}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san sunel&#275;luthuiai\)</i></b>. Periphrastic<br>
  past perfect active of \sunerchomai\. <B>{Followed after}</B><br>
  <b><i>(\katakolouth&#275;sasai\)</i></b>. Aorist active participle of<br>

  16:17. It is possible that they followed after Joseph and<br>
  Nicodemus so that they "beheld the tomb," <b><i>(\etheasanto to<br>
  mn&#275;meion\)</i></b>, and also "how his body was laid" <b><i>(\h&#333;s eteth&#275; to s&#333;ma<br>
  autou\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of \tith&#275;mi\. They may<br>
  in fact, have witnessed the silent burial from a distance. The<br>
  Syriac Sinaitic and the Syriac Curetonian give it thus: "and the<br>
  women, who came with Him from Galilee went to the sepulchre in<br>
  their footsteps, and saw the body when they had brought it in<br>
  there." At any rate the women saw "that" and "how" the body of<br>
  Jesus was laid in this new tomb of Joseph in the rocks.<br>
  <br>
  23:56 <B>{On the sabbath they rested}</B> <b><i>(\to sabbaton h&#275;suchasan\)</i></b>.<br>
  They returned and prepared spices before the sabbath began. Then<br>
  they rested all during the sabbath <b><i>(accusative of extent of time,<br>
  \to sabbaton\)</i></b>.<br>
