<p>2:1 <B>{Again into Capernaum after some days}</B> <b><i>(\palin eis<br>
 Kapharnaoum di' h&#275;mer&#333;n\)</i></b>. After the first tour of Galilee when<br>
 Jesus is back in the city which is now the headquarters for the<br>
 work in Galilee. The phrase \di' h&#275;mer&#333;n\ means days coming in<br>
 between <b><i>(\dia, duo\, two)</i></b> the departure and return. <B>{In the<br>
 house}</B> <b><i>(\en oik&#333;i\)</i></b>. More exactly, <B>{at home}</B>, in the home of<br>
 Peter, now the home of Jesus. Another picture directly from<br>
 Peter's discourse. Some of the manuscripts have here \eis oikon\,<br>
 illustrating the practical identity in meaning of \en\ and \eis\<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 591-6)</i></b>. <B>{It was noised}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kousth&#275;\)</i></b>.<br>
 It was heard <b><i>(first aorist, passive indicative from \akou&#333;\, to<br>
 hear)</i></b>. People spread the rumour, "He is at home, he is indoors."<br>
 <br>
 2:2 <B>{So that there was no longer room for them, no, not even<br>
 about the door}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste m&#275;keti ch&#333;rein m&#275;de ta pros t&#275;n thuran\)</i></b>.<br>
 Another graphic Markan detail seen through Peter's eyes. The<br>
 double compound negative in the Greek intensifies the negative.<br>
 This house door apparently opened into the street, not into a<br>
 court as in the larger houses. The house was packed inside and<br>
 there was a jam outside. <B>{And he spake the word unto them}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 elalei autois ton logon\)</i></b>. And he was speaking the word unto<br>
 them, Mark's favourite descriptive imperfect tense <b><i>(\elalei\)</i></b>.<br>
 Note this word \lale&#333;\ about the preaching of Jesus <b><i>(originally<br>
 just sounds like the chatter of birds, the prattling of children,<br>
but here of the most serious kind of speech.)</i></b> As contrasted with<br>
 \leg&#333;\ <b><i>(to say)</i></b> it is rather an onomatopoetic word with some<br>
 emphasis on the sound and manner of speaking. The word is com-<br>
 mon in the vernacular papyri examples of social inter-course.<br>
 <br>
 2:3 <B>{And they come}</B> <b><i>(\kai erchontai\)</i></b>. Fine illustration of<br>
 Mark's vivid dramatic historical present preserved by Luke <!-#-->Lu<br>
 5:18, but not by <!-#-->Mt 9:2 <b><i>(imperfect)</i></b>. <B>{Borne by four}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\airomenon hupo tessar&#333;n\)</i></b>. Another picturesque Markan detail<br>
 not in the others.<br>
 <br>
 2:4 <B>{Come nigh}</B> <b><i>(\proseggisai\)</i></b>. But Westcott and Hort read<br>
 \prosenegkai\, to bring to, after Aleph, B, L, 33, 63 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Joh<br>
 5:18)</i></b>. <B>{They uncovered the roof}</B> <b><i>(\apestegasan t&#275;n steg&#275;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 They unroofed the roof <b><i>(note paronomasia in the Greek and cognate<br>
 accusative)</i></b>. The only instance of this verb in the N.T. A rare<br>
 word in late Greek, no papyrus example given in Moulton and<br>
 Milligan _Vocabulary_. They climbed up a stairway on the outside<br>
 or ladder to the flat tile roof and dug out or broke up<br>
 <b><i>(\exoruxantes\)</i></b> the tiles <b><i>(the roof)</i></b>. There were thus tiles <b><i>(\dia<br>
 t&#333;n keram&#333;n\, <!-#-->Lu 5:19)</i></b> of laths and plaster and even slabs of<br>
 stone stuck in for strength that had to be dug out. It is not<br>
 clear where Jesus was <b><i>(\hopou &#275;n\)</i></b>, either downstairs,<br>
 <b><i>(Holtzmann)</i></b> or upstairs <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>, or in the quadrangle<br>
 <b><i>(_atrium_ or _compluvium_, if the house had one)</i></b>. "A composition<br>
 of mortar, tar, ashes and sand is spread upon the roofs, and<br>
 rolled hard, and grass grows in the crevices. On the houses of<br>
 the poor in the country the grass grows more freely, and goats<br>
 may be seen on the roofs cropping it" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. <B>{They let down<br>
 the bed}</B> <b><i>(\chal&#333;si ton krabatton\)</i></b>, historical present again,<br>
 aorist tense in <!-#-->Lu 5:19 <b><i>(\kath&#275;kan\)</i></b>. The verb means to lower<br>
 from a higher place as from a boat. Probably the four men had a<br>
 rope fastened to each corner of the pallet or poor man's bed<br>
 <b><i>(\krabatton\, Latin _grabatus_. So one of Mark's Latin words)</i></b>.<br>
 Matthew <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 9:2)</i></b> has \klin&#275;\, general term for bed. Luke has<br>
 \klinidion\ <b><i>(little bed or couch)</i></b>. Mark's word is common in the<br>
 papyri and is spelled also \krabbatos\, sometimes \krabatos\,<br>
 while W, Codex Washingtonius, has it \krabbaton\.<br>
 <br>
 2:5 <B>{Their faith}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n pistin aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. The faith of the four men<br>
 and of the man himself. There is no reason for excluding his<br>
 faith. They all had confidence in the power and willingness of<br>
 Jesus to heal this desperate case. <B>{Are forgiven}</B> <b><i>(\aphientai\,<br>
 aoristic present passive, cf. punctiliar action, Robertson's<br>
 _Grammar_, pp. 864ff.)</i></b>. So <!-#-->Mt 9:3, but <!-#-->Lu 5:20 has the Doric<br>
 perfect passive \aphe&#333;ntai\. The astonishing thing both to the<br>
 paralytic and to the four friends is that Jesus forgave his sins<br>
 instead of healing him. The sins had probably caused the<br>
 paralysis.<br>
 <br>
 2:6 <B>{Sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts}</B> <b><i>(\ekei<br>
 kath&#275;menoi kai dialogizomenoi en tais kardiais aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Another<br>
 of Mark's pictures through Peter's eyes. These scribes <b><i>(and<br>
 Pharisees, <!-#-->Lu 5:21)</i></b> were there to cause trouble, to pick flaws<br>
 in the teaching and conduct of Jesus. His popularity and power<br>
 had aroused their jealousy. There is no evidence that they spoke<br>
 aloud the murmur in their hearts, "within themselves" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 9:3)</i></b>.<br>
 It was not necessary, for their looks gave them away and Jesus<br>
 knew their thoughts <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 9:4)</i></b> and perceived their reasoning <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 5:22)</i></b>. <B>{Instantly Jesus recognized it in his own spirit}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\euthus epignous ho I&#275;sous t&#333;i pneumati autou\, <!-#-->Mr 2:8)</i></b>. The<br>
 Master at once recognizes the hostile atmosphere in the house.<br>
 The debate <b><i>(\dialogizomenoi\)</i></b> in their hearts was written on<br>
 their faces. No sound had come, but feeling did.<br>
 <br>
 2:7 <B>{He blasphemeth}</B> <b><i>(\blasph&#275;mei\)</i></b>. This is the unspoken charge<br>
 in their hearts which Jesus read like an open book. The correct<br>
 text here has this verb. They justify the charge with the<br>
 conviction that God alone has the power <b><i>(\dunatai\)</i></b> to forgive<br>
 sins. The word \blasph&#275;me&#333;\ means injurious speech or slander. It<br>
 was, they held, blasphemy for Jesus to assume this divine<br>
 prerogative. Their logic was correct. The only flaw in it was the<br>
 possibility that Jesus held a peculiar relation to God which<br>
 justified his claim. So the two forces clash here as now on the<br>
 deity of Christ Jesus. Knowing full well that he had exercised<br>
 the prerogative of God in forgiving the man's sins he proceeds to<br>
 justify his claim by healing the man.<br>
 <br>
 2:10 <B>{That ye may know}</B> <b><i>(\hina eid&#275;te\)</i></b>. The scribes could have<br>
 said either of the alternatives in verse <!-#-->9 with equal futility.<br>
 Jesus could say either with equal effectiveness. In fact Jesus<br>
 chose the harder first, the forgiveness which they could not see.<br>
 So he now performs the miracle of healing which all could see,<br>
 that all could know that <b><i>(the Son of Man, Christ's favourite<br>
 designation of himself, a claim to be the Messiah in terms that<br>
 could not be easily attacked)</i></b> he really had the authority and<br>
 power <b><i>(\exousian\)</i></b> to forgive sins. He has the right and power<br>
 here on earth to forgive sins, here and now without waiting for<br>
 the day of judgment. <B>{He saith to the sick of the palsy}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\legei\)</i></b>. This remarkable parenthesis in the middle of the<br>
 sentence occurs also in <!-#-->Mt 9:6 and <!-#-->Lu 5:24, proof that both<br>
 Matthew and Luke followed Mark's narrative. It is inconceivable<br>
 that all three writers should independently have injected the<br>
 same parenthesis at the same place.<br>
 <br>
 2:12 <B>{Before them all}</B> <b><i>(\emprosthen pant&#333;n\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu 5:25 follows<br>
 Mark in this detail. He picked up <b><i>(\aras\)</i></b> his pallet and walked<br>
 and went home as Jesus had commanded him to do <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 2:11)</i></b>. It<br>
 was an amazing proceeding and made it unnecessary for Jesus to<br>
 refute the scribes further on this occasion. The amazement<br>
 <b><i>(\existasthai\, our _ecstasy_, as <!-#-->Lu 5:26 has it)</i></b>, was too<br>
 general and great for words. The people could only say: "We never<br>
 saw it on this fashion" <b><i>(\Hout&#333;s oudepote eidamen\)</i></b>. Jesus had<br>
 acted with the power of God and claimed equality with God and had<br>
 made good his claim. They all marvelled at the <B>{paradoxes}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\paradoxa\, <!-#-->Lu 5:26)</i></b> of that day. For it all they glorified<br>
 God.<br>
 <br>
 2:13 <B>{By the seaside}</B> <b><i>(\para t&#275;n thalassan\)</i></b>. A pretty picture of<br>
 Jesus walking by the sea and a walk that Jesus loved <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:16;<br>
 Mt 4:18)</i></b>. Probably Jesus went out from the crowd in Peter's<br>
 house as soon as he could. It was a joy to get a whiff of fresh<br>
 air by the sea. But it was not long till all the crowd began to<br>
 come to Jesus <b><i>(\&#275;rcheto\, imperfect)</i></b> and Jesus was teaching them<br>
 <b><i>(\edidasken\, imperfect)</i></b>. It was the old story over again, but<br>
 Jesus did not run away.<br>
 <br>
 2:14 <B>{And as he passed by}</B> <b><i>(\kai parag&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present participle<br>
 active, was passing by. Jesus was constantly on the alert for<br>
 opportunities to do good. An unlikely specimen was Levi<br>
 <b><i>(Matthew)</i></b>, son of Alpheus, sitting at the toll-gate <b><i>(\tel&#333;nion\)</i></b><br>
 on the Great West Road from Damascus to the Mediterranean. He was<br>
 a publican <b><i>(\tel&#333;n&#275;s\)</i></b> who collected toll for Herod Antipas. The<br>
 Jews hated or despised these publicans and classed them with<br>
 sinners <b><i>(\hamart&#333;loi\)</i></b>. The challenge of Jesus was sudden and<br>
 sharp, but Levi <b><i>(Matthew)</i></b> was ready to respond at once. He had<br>
 heard of Jesus and quickly decided. Great decisions are often<br>
 made on a moment's notice. Levi is a fine object lesson for<br>
 business men who put off service to Christ to carry on their<br>
 business.<br>
 <br>
 2:16 <B>{The scribes of the Pharisees}</B> <b><i>(\hoi grammateis t&#333;n<br>
 Pharisai&#333;n\)</i></b>. This is the correct text. Cf. "their scribes" in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 5:30. Matthew gave a great reception <b><i>(\doch&#275;n\, <!-#-->Lu 5:29)</i></b><br>
 in his house <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 2:15)</i></b>. These publicans and sinners not simply<br>
 accepted Levi's invitation, but they imitated his example "and<br>
 were following Jesus" <b><i>(\kai &#275;kolouthoun aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. It was a motly<br>
 crew from the standpoint of these young theologues, scribes of<br>
 the Pharisees, who were on hand, being invited to pick flaws if<br>
 they could. It was probably in the long hall of the house where<br>
 the scribes stood and ridiculed Jesus and the disciples, unless<br>
 they stood outside, feeling too pious to go into the house of a<br>
 publican. It was an offence for a Jew to eat with Gentiles as<br>
 even many of the early Jewish Christians felt <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:3)</i></b> and<br>
 publicans and sinners were regarded like Gentiles <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 5:11)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:17 <B>{The righteous}</B> <b><i>(\dikaious\)</i></b>. Jesus for the sake of argument<br>
 accepts the claim of the Pharisees to be righteous, though, as a<br>
 matter of fact, they fell very far short of it. Elsewhere <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 23)</i></b> Jesus shows that the Pharisees were extortionate and<br>
 devoured widows' houses and wore a cloak of pride and<br>
 hypocritical respectability. The words "unto repentance" <b><i>(\eis<br>
 metanoian\)</i></b> are not genuine in Mark, but are in <!-#-->Lu 5:32. Jesus<br>
 called men to new spiritual life and away from sin and so to<br>
 repentance. But this claim stopped their mouths against what<br>
 Jesus was doing. The well or the strong <b><i>(\ischuontes\)</i></b> are not<br>
 those who need the physician in an epidemic.<br>
 <br>
 2:18 <B>{John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san hoi<br>
 math&#275;tai I&#333;anou kai hoi Pharisaioi n&#275;steuontes\)</i></b>. The<br>
 periphrastic imperfect, so common in Mark's vivid description.<br>
 Probably Levi's feast happened on one of the weekly fast-days<br>
 <b><i>(second and fifth days of the week for the stricter Jews)</i></b>. So<br>
 there was a clash of standpoints. The disciples of John sided<br>
 with the Pharisees in the Jewish ceremonial ritualistic<br>
 observances. John was still a prisoner in Machaerus. John was<br>
 more of an ascetic than Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 18f.; Lu 7:33-35)</i></b>, but<br>
 neither one pleased all the popular critics. These learners<br>
 <b><i>(\math&#275;tai\)</i></b> or disciples of John had missed the spirit of their<br>
 leader when they here lined up with the Pharisees against Jesus.<br>
 But there was no real congeniality between the formalism of the<br>
 Pharisees and the asceticism of John the Baptist. The Pharisees<br>
 hated John who had denounced them as broods of vipers. Here the<br>
 disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees <b><i>(\hoi<br>
 math&#275;tai I&#333;anou kai hoi math&#275;tai t&#333;n Pharisai&#333;n\)</i></b> join in<br>
 criticizing Jesus and his disciples. Later we shall see<br>
 Pharisees, Sadducees, and Herodians, who bitterly detested each<br>
 other, making com- mon cause against Jesus Christ. So today we<br>
 find various hostile groups combining against our Lord and<br>
 Saviour. See on &#175;Mt 9:14-17 for comments. Matthew has here<br>
 followed Mark closely.<br>
 <br>
 2:19 <B>{The sons of the bridechamber}</B> <b><i>(\hoi huioi tou numph&#333;nos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Not merely the groomsmen, but the guests also, the \paranymphs\<br>
 <b><i>(\paranumphoi\ of the old Greek)</i></b>. Jesus here adopts the Baptist's<br>
 own metaphor <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 3:29)</i></b>, changing the friend of the bridegroom<br>
 <b><i>(\ho philos tou numphiou\)</i></b> to sons of the bridechamber. Jesus<br>
 identifies himself with the bridegroom of the O.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Ho 2:21)</i></b>,<br>
 God in his covenant relation with Israel <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. Mourning does<br>
 not suit the wedding feast. Mark, Matthew, and Luke all give the<br>
 three parables <b><i>(bridegroom, unfulled cloth, new wineskins)</i></b><br>
 illustrating and defending the conduct of Jesus in feasting with<br>
 Levi on a Jewish fast-day. <!-#-->Lu 5:36 calls these parables. Jesus<br>
 here seems iconoclastic to the ecclesiastics and revolutionary in<br>
 emphasis on the spiritual instead of the ritualistic and<br>
 ceremonial.<br>
 <br>
 2:21 <B>{Seweth on}</B> <b><i>(\epirhaptei\)</i></b>. Here only in the N.T. or<br>
 elsewhere, though the uncompounded verb \rhapt&#333;\ <b><i>(to sew)</i></b> is<br>
 common enough, <B>{sews upon:}</B> in <!-#-->Mt 9:16 and <!-#-->Lu 5:37 use<br>
 \epiballei\, put upon or clap upon.<br>
 <br>
 2:22 <B>{But new wine into fresh wineskins}</B> <b><i>(\alla oinon neon eis<br>
 askous kainous\)</i></b>. Westcott and Hort bracket this clause as a<br>
 Western non-interpolation though omitted only in D and some old<br>
 Latin MSS. It is genuine in <!-#-->Lu 5:38 and may be so here.<br>
 <br>
 2:23 <B>{Through the cornfields}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#333;n sporim&#333;n\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt<br>
 12:1. So Matt. and <!-#-->Lu 6:1. But Mark uses \paraporeuesthai\, to<br>
 go along beside, unless \diaporeuesthai\ <b><i>(BCD)</i></b> is accepted.<br>
 Perhaps now on the edge, now within the grain. Mark uses also<br>
 \hodon poiein\, to <B>{make a way}</B> like the Latin _iter facere_, as<br>
 if through the standing grain, <B>{plucking the ears}</B> <b><i>(\tillontes<br>
 tous stachuas\)</i></b>. Work of preparing food the rabbis called it. The<br>
 margin of the Revised Version has it correctly: They began to<br>
 make their way plucking the ears of corn <b><i>(grain, wheat or barley,<br>
 we should say)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 12:1-8 for discussion of this<br>
 passage, parallel also in <!-#-->Lu 6:15.<br>
 <br>
 2:26 <B>{The house of God}</B> <b><i>(\ton oikon tou theou\)</i></b>. The tent or<br>
 tabernacle at Nob, not the temple in Jerusalem built by Solomon.<br>
 <B>{When Abiathar was high priest}</B> <b><i>(\epi Abiathar archiere&#333;s\)</i></b>. Neat<br>
 Greek idiom, in the time of Abiathar as high priest. There was<br>
 confusion in the Massoretic text and in the LXX about the<br>
 difference between Ahimelech <b><i>(Abimelech)</i></b> and Abiathar <b><i>(<!-#-->2Sa<br>
 8:17)</i></b>, Ahimelech's son and successor <b><i>(<!-#-->1Sa 21:2; 22:20)</i></b>.<br>
 Apparently Ahimelech, not Abiathar was high priest at this time.<br>
 It is possible that both father and son bore both names <b><i>(<!-#-->1Sa<br>
 22:20; 2Sa 8:17; 1Ch 18:16)</i></b>, Abiathar mentioned though both<br>
 involved. \Epi\ may so mean in the passage about Abiathar. Or we<br>
 may leave it unexplained. They had the most elaborate rules for<br>
 the preparation of the shewbread <b><i>(\tous artous t&#275;s prothese&#333;s\)</i></b>,<br>
 the loaves of presentation, the loaves of the face or presence of<br>
 God. It was renewed on the commencement of the sabbath and the<br>
 old bread deposited on the golden table in the porch of the<br>
 Sanctuary. This old bread was eaten by the priests as they came<br>
 and went. This is what David ate.<br>
 <br>
 2:27 <B>{For man}</B> <b><i>(\dia ton anthr&#333;pon\)</i></b>. Mark alone has this<br>
 profound saying which subordinates the sabbath to man's real<br>
 welfare <b><i>(mankind, observe, generic article with \anthr&#333;pos\,<br>
 class from class)</i></b>. Man was not made for the sabbath as the rabbis<br>
 seemed to think with all their petty rules about eating an egg<br>
 laid on the sabbath or looking in the glass, _et cetera_. See<br>
 2Macc. 5:19 and _Mechilta_ on <!-#-->Ex 31:13: "The sabbath is<br>
 delivered unto you and ye are not delivered unto the sabbath."<br>
 Christianity has had to fight this same battle about<br>
 institutionalism. The church itself is for man, not man for the<br>
 church.<br>
 <br>
 2:28 <B>{Even of the sabbath}</B> <b><i>(\kai tou sabbatou\)</i></b>. Mark, Matthew<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 12:8)</i></b>, and Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:5)</i></b> all give this as a climax in the<br>
 five reasons given by Christ on the occasion for the conduct of<br>
 the disciples, but Mark has the little word "even" <b><i>(\kai\)</i></b> not in<br>
 the others, showing that Jesus knew that he was making a great<br>
 claim as the Son of Man, the Representative Man, the Messiah<br>
 looked at from his human interest, to lordship <b><i>(\kurios\)</i></b> even of<br>
 the sabbath. He was not the slave of the sabbath, but the master<br>
 of it. "Even of the sabbath, so invaluable in your eyes. Lord,<br>
 not to abolish, but to interpret and keep in its own place, and<br>
 give it a new name" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
