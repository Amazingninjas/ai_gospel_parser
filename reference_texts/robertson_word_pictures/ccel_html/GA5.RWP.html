 <HR>
<p>5:1 <B>{With freedom}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i eleutheri&#257;i\)</i></b>. Rather dative case<br>
 instead of instrumental, "for freedom," "for the <b><i>(article)</i></b><br>
 freedom that belongs to us children of the freewoman" <b><i>(<!-#-->4:31)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Did Christ set us free}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;mas Christos &#275;leuther&#333;sen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Effective aorist active indicative of \eleuthero&#333;\ <b><i>(from<br>
 \erchomai\, to go, go free)</i></b>. <B>{Stand fast therefore}</B> <b><i>(\st&#275;kete<br>
 oun\)</i></b>. See on <!-#-->Mr 3:31; 1Co 16:13 for this late word from<br>
 perfect stem of \hist&#275;mi\, "keep on standing therefore," "stay<br>
 free since Christ set you free." <B>{Be not entangled again}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;<br>
 palin enechesthe\)</i></b>. "Stop being held in by a yoke of bondage."<br>
 Common word for ensnare by trap. The Judaizers were trying to<br>
 lasso the Galatians for the old yoke of Judaism.<br>
 <br>
 5:2 <B>{I Paul}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; Paulos\)</i></b>. Asserts all his personal and<br>
 apostolic authority. For both words see also <!-#-->1Th 2:16; 2Co 10:1;<br>
 Col 1:23; Eph 3:1. <B>{If ye receive circumcision}</B> <b><i>(\ean<br>
 peritemn&#275;sthe\)</i></b>. Condition of third class and present passive<br>
 subjunctive, a supposable case, but with terrible consequences,<br>
 for they will make circumcision a condition of salvation. In that<br>
 case Christ will help them not at all.<br>
 <br>
 5:3 <B>{A debtor}</B> <b><i>(\opheilet&#275;s\)</i></b>. Common word from \opheil&#333;\, to owe<br>
 for one who has assumed an obligation. See on &#175;Mt 6:12. See <!-#-->Ga<br>
 3:10. He takes the curse on himself.<br>
 <br>
 5:4 <B>{Ye are severed from Christ}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;rg&#275;th&#275;te apo Christou\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive of \katarge&#333;\, to make null and void as in<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 7:2,6. <B>{Who would be justified by the law}</B> <b><i>(\hoitines en<br>
 nom&#333;i dikaiousthe\)</i></b>. Present passive conative indicative, "ye who<br>
 are trying to be justified in the law." <B>{Ye are fallen away from<br>
 grace}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;s charitos exepesate\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative of \ekpipt&#333;\ <b><i>(with \a\ variable vowel of the first<br>
 aorist)</i></b> and followed by the ablative case. "Ye did fall out of<br>
 grace," "ye left the sphere of grace in Christ and took your<br>
 stand in the sphere of law" as your hope of salvation. Paul does<br>
 not mince words and carries the logic to the end of the course.<br>
 He is not, of course, speaking of occasional sins, but he has in<br>
 mind a far more serious matter, that of substituting law for<br>
 Christ as the agent in salvation.<br>
 <br>
 5:5 <B>{For we}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meis gar\)</i></b>. We Christians as opposed to the<br>
 legalists. <B>{Through the Spirit by faith}</B> <b><i>(\pneumati ek piste&#333;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 By the Spirit <b><i>(Holy Spirit)</i></b> out of faith <b><i>(not law)</i></b>. Clear-cut<br>
 repetition to make it plain.<br>
 <br>
 5:6 <B>{Availeth anything}</B> <b><i>(\ischuei ti\)</i></b>. Old word to have strength<br>
 <b><i>(\isch&#8211;s\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 5:13. Neither Jew nor Greek has any<br>
 recommendation in his state. See <!-#-->3:28. All stand on a level in<br>
 Christ. <B>{Faith working through love}</B> <b><i>(\pistis di' agap&#275;s<br>
 energoumen&#275;\)</i></b>. Middle voice of \energe&#333;\ and "through love," "the<br>
 moral dynamic" <b><i>(Burton)</i></b> of Paul's conception of freedom from law.<br>
 <br>
 5:7 Who did hinder you? <b><i>(\tis humas enekopsen?\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active indicative of \enkopt&#333;\, to cut in on one, for all the<br>
 world like our use of one cutting in on us at the telephone. For<br>
 this late verb see on &#175;Ac 24:4; 1Th 2:18. Note the singular<br>
 \tis\. There was some ringleader in the business. Some one "cut<br>
 in" on the Galatians as they were running the Christian race and<br>
 tried to trip them or to turn them.<br>
 <br>
 5:8 <B>{This persuasion}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; peismon&#275;\)</i></b>. "The art of persuasion,"<br>
 the effort of the Judaizers to persuade you. Only here and in<br>
 ecclesiastical writers.<br>
 <br>
 5:9 This proverb Paul has in <!-#-->1Co 5:6. It is merely the<br>
 pervasive power of leaven that is involved in the proverb as in<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 13:33, not the use of leaven as a symbol of evil.<br>
 <br>
 5:10 <B>{Whosoever he be}</B> <b><i>(\hostis ean &#275;i\)</i></b>. Indefinite relative<br>
 clause with \ean\ and subjunctive. It seems unlikely that Paul<br>
 knew precisely who the leader was. In <!-#-->1:6 he uses the plural of<br>
 the same verb \tarass&#333;\ and see also \anastatountes\ in verse<br>
 <!-#-->12.<br>
 <br>
 5:11 <B>{Why am I still persecuted?}</B> <b><i>(\ti eti di&#333;komai?\)</i></b>. Some of<br>
 the Judaizers even circulated the slander that Paul preached<br>
 circumcision in order to ruin his influence.<br>
 <br>
 5:12 <B>{I would}</B> <b><i>(\ophelon\)</i></b>. Would that, used as conjunction in<br>
 wishes. See on &#175;1Co 4:2; 2Co 11:1. Here a wish about the future<br>
 with future indicative. <B>{They which unsettle you}</B> <b><i>(\hoi<br>
 anastatountes humas\)</i></b>. Late verb from \anastatos\, driven from<br>
 one's abode, and in papyri in this sense as well as in sense of<br>
 upsetting or disturbing one's mind <b><i>(boy's letter)</i></b> as here. In <!-#-->Ac<br>
 17:6; 21:38 we have it in sense of making a commotion. <B>{Cut<br>
 themselves off}</B> <b><i>(\apokopsontai\)</i></b>. Future middle of \apokopt&#333;\,<br>
 old word to cut off as in <!-#-->Ac 27:32, here to mutilate.<br>
 <br>
 5:13 <B>{Ye were called for freedom}</B> <b><i>(\ep' eleutheri&#257;i ekl&#275;th&#275;te\)</i></b>.<br>
 The same point as in <!-#-->5:1 made plainer by the use of \ep'\ <b><i>(on<br>
 the basis of, for the purpose of)</i></b>. See <!-#-->1Th 4:7 for this use of<br>
 \epi\. <B>{Only use not}</B> <b><i>(\monon m&#275;\)</i></b>. No word for "use" in the<br>
 Greek. Probably supply \trepete\ or \strephete\, "turn not your<br>
 liberty into an occasion for the flesh" <b><i>(\eis aphorm&#275;n t&#275;i<br>
 sarki\)</i></b>, as a spring board for license. On \aphorm&#275;\, see on &#175;2Co<br>
 5:12. Liberty so easily turns to license.<br>
 <br>
 5:14 <B>{Even in this}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i\)</i></b>. Just the article with \en\, "in<br>
 the," but it points at the quotation from <!-#-->Le 19:18. Jews <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 10:29)</i></b> confined "neighbour" <b><i>(\pl&#275;sion\)</i></b> to Jews. Paul uses here<br>
 a striking paradox by urging obedience to the law against which<br>
 he has been arguing, but this is the moral law as proof of the<br>
 new love and life. See also <!-#-->Ro 13:8, precisely as Jesus did<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 22:40)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:15 <B>{If ye bite and devour one another}</B> <b><i>(\ei all&#275;lous daknete<br>
 kai katesthiete\)</i></b>. Condition of first class assumed as true. Two<br>
 common and old verbs often used together of wild animals, or like<br>
 cats and dogs. <B>{That ye be not consumed one of another}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; hup'<br>
 all&#275;l&#333;n anal&#333;th&#275;te\)</i></b>. Negative final clause with first aorist<br>
 passive subjunctive of \analisk&#333;\, old word to consume or spend.<br>
 In N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 9:54. There is a famous story of two<br>
 snakes that grabbed each other by the tail and each swallowed the<br>
 other.<br>
 <br>
 5:16 <B>{Ye shall not fulfil}</B> <b><i>(\ou m&#275; teles&#275;te\)</i></b>. Rather, "Ye will<br>
 not fulfil." Strong double negative with aorist active<br>
 subjunctive. <B>{The lust of the flesh}</B> <b><i>(\epithumian sarkos\)</i></b>. Bad<br>
 sense here as usual in Paul, but not so in <!-#-->1Th 2:17; Php 1:23.<br>
 The word is just craving or longing <b><i>(from \epi, thumos\, yearning<br>
 after)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:17 <B>{Lusteth against}</B> <b><i>(\epithumei kata\)</i></b>. Like a tug of war.<br>
 This use of \sarx\ as opposed to the Spirit <b><i>(Holy Spirit)</i></b><br>
 personifies \sarx\. Lightfoot argues that \epithumei\ cannot be<br>
 used with the Spirit and so some other verb must be supplied for<br>
 it. But that is wholly needless, for the verb, like \epithumia\,<br>
 does not mean evil desire, but simply to long for. Christ and<br>
 Satan long for the possession of the city of Man Soul as Bunyan<br>
 shows. <B>{Are contrary the one to the other}</B> <b><i>(\all&#275;lois<br>
 antikeitai\)</i></b>. Are lined up in conflict, face to face <b><i>(\anti-\)</i></b>, a<br>
 spiritual duel <b><i>(cf. Christ's temptations)</i></b>, with dative case of<br>
 personal interest <b><i>(\all&#275;lois\)</i></b>. <B>{That ye may not do}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275;<br>
 poi&#275;te\)</i></b>. "That ye may not keep on doing" <b><i>(present active<br>
 subjunctive of \poie&#333;\)</i></b>. <B>{That ye would}</B> <b><i>(\ha ean thel&#275;te\)</i></b>.<br>
 "Whatever ye wish" <b><i>(indefinite relative with \ean\ and present<br>
 subjunctive)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:18 <B>{Under the law}</B> <b><i>(\hupo nomon\)</i></b>. Instead of "under the flesh"<br>
 as one might expect. See <!-#-->Ga 3:2-6 for contrast between law and<br>
 spirit. The flesh made the law weak <b><i>(<!-#-->Rom 8:3; Heb 9:10,13)</i></b>.<br>
 They are one and the same in result. See same idea in <!-#-->Ro 8:14.<br>
 Note present tense of \agesthe\ <b><i>(if you are continually led by<br>
 the Spirit)</i></b>. See verse <!-#-->23.<br>
 <br>
 5:19 <B>{Manifest}</B> <b><i>(\phanera\)</i></b>. Opposed to "hidden" <b><i>(\krupta\)</i></b>.<br>
 Ancient writers were fond of lists of vices and virtues. Cf.<br>
 Stalker's sermons on _The Seven Cardinal Virtues_ and _The Seven<br>
 Deadly Sins_. There are more than seven in this deadly list in<br>
 verses <!-#-->19-21. He makes the two lists in explanation of the<br>
 conflict in verse <!-#-->17 to emphasize the command in verses <!-#-->13f.<br>
 There are four groups in Paul's list of manifest vices: <b><i>(I)</i></b><br>
 Sensual sins like fornication <b><i>(\porneia\, prostitution,<br>
 harlotry)</i></b>, uncleanness <b><i>(\akatharsia\, moral impurity)</i></b>,<br>
 lasciviousness <b><i>(\aselgeia\, wantonness)</i></b>, sexual vice of all kinds<br>
 prevailed in heathenism. <b><i>(2)</i></b> Idolatry <b><i>(\eid&#333;latreia\, worship of<br>
 idols)</i></b> and witchcraft <b><i>(\pharmakeia\ from \pharmakon\, a drug, the<br>
 ministering of drugs)</i></b>, but the sorcerers monopolized the word for<br>
 a while in their magical arts and used it in connection with<br>
 idolatry. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->Re 18:23. See <!-#-->Ac 19:19<br>
 \perierga\, curious arts. <b><i>(3)</i></b> Personal relations expressed by<br>
 eight words, all old words, sins of the spirit, like enmities<br>
 <b><i>(\exthrai\, personal animosities)</i></b>, strife <b><i>(\eris\, rivalry,<br>
 discord)</i></b>, jealousies <b><i>(\z&#275;los\ or \z&#275;loi\, MSS. vary, our very<br>
 word)</i></b>, wraths <b><i>(\thumoi\, stirring emotions, then explosions)</i></b>,<br>
 factions <b><i>(\eritheiai\, from \erithos\, day labourer for hire,<br>
 worker in wool, party spirit)</i></b>, divisions <b><i>(\dichostasiai\, splits<br>
 in two, \dicha\ and \stasis\)</i></b>, heresies <b><i>(\haireseis\, the very<br>
 word, but really choosings from \haireomai\, preferences)</i></b>,<br>
 envyings <b><i>(\phthonoi\, feelings of ill-will)</i></b>. Surely a lively<br>
 list. <b><i>(4)</i></b> <B>{Drunkenness}</B> <b><i>(\methai\, old word and plural, drunken<br>
 excesses, in N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 21:34; Ro 13:13)</i></b>, revellings<br>
 <b><i>(\k&#333;moi\, old word also for drinking parties like those in honour<br>
 of Bacchus, in N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ro 13:13; 1Pe 4:3)</i></b>. <B>{And such<br>
 like}</B> <b><i>(\kai ta homoia toutois\)</i></b>. And the things like these<br>
 <b><i>(associative instrumental \toutois\ after \homoia\, like)</i></b>. It is<br>
 not meant to be exhaustive, but it is representative.<br>
 <br>
 5:21 <B>{Forewarn}</B> <b><i>(\proleg&#333;\)</i></b> <B>{--did forewarn}</B> <b><i>(\proeipon\)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 repeats his warning given while with them. He did his duty then.<br>
 Gentile churches were peculiarly subject to these sins. But who<br>
 is not in danger from them? <B>{Practise}</B> <b><i>(\prassontes\)</i></b>. \Prass&#333;\<br>
 is the verb for habitual practice <b><i>(our very word, in fact)</i></b>, not<br>
 \poie&#333;\ for occasional doing. The <B>{habit}</B> of these sins is proof<br>
 that one is not in the Kingdom of God and will not inherit it.<br>
 <br>
 5:22 <B>{The fruit of the Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\ho karpos tou pneumatos\)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 changes the figure from <B>{works}</B> <b><i>(\erga\)</i></b> in verse <!-#-->19 to fruit<br>
 as the normal out-cropping of the Holy Spirit in us. It is a<br>
 beautiful tree of fruit that Paul pictures here with nine<br>
 luscious fruits on it: <B>{Love}</B> <b><i>(\agap&#275;\)</i></b>. Late, almost Biblical<br>
 word. First as in <!-#-->1Co 13, which see for discussion as superior<br>
 to \philia\ and \er&#333;s\. <B>{Joy}</B> <b><i>(\chara\)</i></b>. Old word. See on &#175;1Th<br>
 1:6. <B>{Peace}</B> <b><i>(\eir&#275;n&#275;\)</i></b>. See on &#175;1Th 1:1. <B>{Long-suffering}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\makrothumia\)</i></b>. See on &#175;2Co 6:6. <B>{Kindness}</B> <b><i>(\chr&#275;stot&#275;s\)</i></b>. See<br>
 on &#175;2Co 6:6. <B>{Goodness}</B> <b><i>(\agath&#333;sun&#275;\)</i></b>. See on &#175;2Th 1:11.<br>
 <B>{Faithfulness}</B> <b><i>(\pistis\)</i></b>. Same word as "faith." See on &#175;Mt<br>
 23:33; 1Co 13:7,13. <B>{Meekness}</B> <b><i>(\praut&#275;s\)</i></b>. See on &#175;1Co 4:21;<br>
 2Co 10:1. <B>{Temperance}</B> <b><i>(\egkrateia\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Ac 24:25. Old<br>
 word from \egkrat&#275;s\, one holding control or holding in. In N.T.<br>
 only in these passages and <!-#-->2Pe 1:6. Paul has a better list than<br>
 the four cardinal virtues of the Stoics <b><i>(temperance, prudence,<br>
 fortitude, justice)</i></b>, though they are included with better notes<br>
 struck. Temperance is alike, but kindness is better than justice,<br>
 long-suffering than fortitude, love than prudence.<br>
 <br>
 5:24 <B>{Crucified the flesh}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n sarka estaur&#333;san\)</i></b>. Definite<br>
 event, first aorist active indicative of \stauro&#333;\ as in <!-#-->2:19<br>
 <b><i>(mystical union with Christ)</i></b>. Paul uses \sarx\ here in the same<br>
 sense as in verses <!-#-->16,17,19, "the force in men that makes for<br>
 evil" <b><i>(Burton)</i></b>. <B>{With}</B> <b><i>(\sun\)</i></b>. "Together with," emphasizing "the<br>
 completeness of the extermination of this evil force" and the<br>
 guarantee of victory over one's passions and dispositions toward<br>
 evil.<br>
 <br>
 5:25 <B>{By the Spirit let us also walk}</B> <b><i>(\pneumati kai<br>
 stoich&#333;men\)</i></b>. Present subjunctive <b><i>(volitive)</i></b> of \stoiche&#333;\, "Let<br>
 us also go on walking by the Spirit." Let us make our steps by<br>
 the help and guidance of the Spirit.<br>
 <br>
 5:26 <B>{Let us not be}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; gin&#333;metha\)</i></b>. Present middle subjunctive<br>
 <b><i>(volitive)</i></b>, "Let us cease becoming vainglorious" <b><i>(\kenodoxoi\)</i></b>,<br>
 late word only here in N.T. <b><i>(\kenos, doxa\)</i></b>. Once in Epictetus in<br>
 same sense. <B>{Provoking one another}</B> <b><i>(\all&#275;lous prokaloumenoi\)</i></b>.<br>
 Old word \prokale&#333;\, to call forth, to challenge to combat. Only<br>
 here in N.T. and in bad sense. The word for "provoke" in <!-#-->Heb<br>
 10:24 is \paroxusmon\ <b><i>(our "paroxysm")</i></b>. <B>{Envying}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\phthonountes\)</i></b>. Old verb from \phthonos\. Only here in N.T.<br>
