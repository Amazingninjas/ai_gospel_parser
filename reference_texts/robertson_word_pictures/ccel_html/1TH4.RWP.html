<p>4:1 <B>{Finally}</B> <b><i>(\loipon\)</i></b>. Accusative of general reference of<br>
 \loipos\, as for the rest. It does not mean actual conclusion,<br>
 but merely a colloquial expression pointing towards the end<br>
 <b><i>(Milligan)</i></b> as in <!-#-->2Co 13:11; 2Ti 4:8. So \to loipon\ in <!-#-->2Th<br>
 3:1; Php 3:1; 4:8. <B>{We beseech}</B> <b><i>(\er&#333;t&#333;men\)</i></b>. Not "question" as<br>
 in ancient Greek, but as often in N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 5:12; 2Th 2:1; Php<br>
 4:3)</i></b> and also in papyri to make urgent request of one. <B>{How ye<br>
 ought}</B> <b><i>(\to p&#333;s dei hum&#257;s\)</i></b>. Literally, explanatory articular<br>
 indirect question <b><i>(\to p&#333;s\)</i></b> after \parelab&#275;te\ according to<br>
 common classic idiom in Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:62; 22:2,4,23,24)</i></b> and Paul<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 8:26)</i></b>. <B>{That ye abound}</B> <b><i>(\hina perisseu&#275;te\)</i></b>. Loose<br>
 construction of the \hina\ clause with present subjunctive after<br>
 two subordinate clauses with \kath&#333;s\ <b><i>(as, even as)</i></b> to be<br>
 connected with "beseech and exhort." <B>{More and more}</B> <b><i>(\mallon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Simply <B>{more}</B>, but added to same idea in \perisseu&#275;te\. See also<br>
 verse <!-#-->11.<br>
 <br>
 4:2 <B>{What charge}</B> <b><i>(\tinas paraggelias\)</i></b>. Plural, charges or<br>
 precepts, command <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 16:24)</i></b>, prohibition <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 5:28)</i></b>, right<br>
 living <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 1:5)</i></b>. Military term in Xenophon and Polybius.<br>
 <br>
 4:3 <B>{Your sanctification}</B> <b><i>(\ho hagiasmos hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Found only in<br>
 the Greek Bible and ecclesiastical writers from \hagiaz&#333;\ and<br>
 both to take the place of the old words \hagiz&#333;, hagismos\ with<br>
 their technical ideas of consecration to a god or goddess that<br>
 did not include holiness in life. So Paul makes a sharp and<br>
 pointed stand here for the Christian idea of sanctification as<br>
 being "the will of God" <b><i>(apposition)</i></b> and as further explained by<br>
 the epexegetic infinitive <B>{that ye abstain from fornication}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\apechesthai humas apo t&#275;s porneias\)</i></b>. Pagan religion did not<br>
 demand sexual purity of its devotees, the gods and goddesses<br>
 being grossly immoral. Priestesses were in the temples for the<br>
 service of the men who came.<br>
 <br>
 4:4 <B>{That each one of you know how}</B> <b><i>(\eidenai hekaston hum&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Further epexegetic infinitive <b><i>(second perfect active)</i></b>, learn how<br>
 and so know how <b><i>(learn the habit of purity)</i></b>. <B>{To possess himself<br>
 of his own vessel}</B> <b><i>(\to heautou skeuos ktasthai\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 infinitive of \ktaomai\, to acquire, not \kekt&#275;sthai\, to<br>
 possess. But what does Paul mean by "his own vessel"? It can only<br>
 mean his own body or his own wife. Objections are raised against<br>
 either view, but perhaps he means that the man shall acquire his<br>
 own wife "in sanctification and honour," words that elevate the<br>
 wife and make it plain that Paul demands sexual purity on the<br>
 part of men <b><i>(married as well as unmarried)</i></b>. There is no double<br>
 standard here. When the husband comes to the marriage bed, he<br>
 should come as a chaste man to a chaste wife.<br>
 <br>
 4:5 <B>{Not in the passion of lust}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; en pathei epithumias\)</i></b>.<br>
 Plain picture of the wrong way for the husband to come to<br>
 marriage. <B>{That know not God}</B> <b><i>(\ta m&#275; eidota ton theon\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 perfect participle of \oida\. The heathen knew gods as licentious<br>
 as they are themselves, but not God. One of the reasons for the<br>
 revival of paganism in modern life is professedly this very thing<br>
 that men wish to get rid of the inhibitions against<br>
 licentiousness by God.<br>
 <br>
 4:6 <B>{That no man transgress}</B> <b><i>(\to m&#275; huperbainein\)</i></b>. Old verb to<br>
 go beyond. Final use of \to\ <b><i>(accusative of general reference)</i></b><br>
 and the infinitive <b><i>(negative \m&#275;\)</i></b>, parallel to \apechesthai\ and<br>
 \eidenai ktasthai\ above. <B>{And wrong his brother}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 pleonektein ton adelphon autou\)</i></b>. To take more, to overreach, to<br>
 take advantage of, to defraud. <B>{In the matter}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i<br>
 pragmati\)</i></b>. The delicacy of Paul makes him refrain from plainer<br>
 terms and the context makes it clear enough as in <!-#-->2Co 7:11<br>
 <b><i>(\t&#333;i pragmati\)</i></b>. <B>{An avenger}</B> <b><i>(\ekdikos\)</i></b>. Regular term in the<br>
 papyri for legal avenger. Modern men and women need to remember<br>
 that God is the avenger for sexual wrongs both in this life and<br>
 the next.<br>
 <br>
 4:7 <B>{Not for uncleanness, but in sanctification}</B> <b><i>(\epi<br>
 akatharsi&#257;i all' en hagiasm&#333;i\)</i></b>. Sharp contrast made still<br>
 sharper by the two prepositions \epi\ <b><i>(on the basis of)</i></b> and \en\<br>
 <b><i>(in the sphere of)</i></b>. God has "called" us all for a decent sex life<br>
 consonant with his aims and purposes. It was necessary for Paul<br>
 to place this lofty ideal before the Thessalonian Christians<br>
 living in a pagan world. It is equally important now.<br>
 <br>
 4:8 <B>{Therefore}</B> <b><i>(\toigaroun\)</i></b>. This old triple compound particle<br>
 <b><i>(\toi, gar, oun\)</i></b> is in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Heb 12:1. Paul<br>
 applies the logic of the case. <B>{He that rejecteth}</B> <b><i>(\ho<br>
 athet&#333;n\)</i></b>. This late verb <b><i>(Polybius and LXX)</i></b> is from \a-thetos\<br>
 <b><i>(\a\ privative and verbal of \tith&#275;mi\, to proscribe a thing, to<br>
 annul it.)</i></b> <B>{But God}</B> <b><i>(\alla ton theon\)</i></b>. Paul sees this clearly<br>
 and modern atheists see it also. In order to justify their<br>
 licentiousness they do not hesitate to set aside God.<br>
 <br>
 4:9 <B>{Concerning love of the brethren}</B> <b><i>(\peri t&#275;s philadelphias\)</i></b>.<br>
 Late word, love of brothers or sisters. In profane Greek <b><i>(one<br>
 papyrus example)</i></b> and LXX the word means love of those actually<br>
 kin by blood, but in the N.T. it is the kinship in the love of<br>
 Christ as here. <B>{Are taught by God}</B> <b><i>(\theodidaktoi este\)</i></b>. Only<br>
 here and ecclesiastical writers. Passive verbal adjective in<br>
 \-tos\ from \didask&#333;\ as if \theo-\ in ablative case like<br>
 \didaktoi theou\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:45)</i></b>. <B>{To love one another}</B> <b><i>(\eis to<br>
 agap&#257;in all&#275;lous\)</i></b>. Another example of \eis to\ and the<br>
 infinitive. Only those taught of God keep on loving one another,<br>
 love neighbours and even enemies as Jesus taught <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:44)</i></b>.<br>
 Note the use of \agapa&#333;\, not \phile&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 4:10 <B>{Ye do it}</B> <b><i>(\poieite auto\)</i></b>. The \auto\ refers to \to<br>
 agap&#257;in all&#275;lous\ <b><i>(to love one another)</i></b>. Delicate praise.<br>
 <br>
 4:11 <B>{That ye study to be quiet}</B> <b><i>(\philotimeisthai h&#275;suchazein\)</i></b>.<br>
 First infinitive dependent on \parakaloumen\ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->10, we<br>
 exhort you)</i></b>, the second on \philotimeisthai\ <b><i>(old verb from<br>
 \philotimos\, fond of honour, \philos, tim&#275;\)</i></b>. The notion of<br>
 ambition appears in each of the three N.T. examples <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 4:11;<br>
 2Co 5:9; Ro 5:20)</i></b>, but it is ambition to do good, not evil. The<br>
 word ambition is Latin <b><i>(_ambitio_ from _ambo, ire_)</i></b>, to go on<br>
 both sides to accomplish one's aims and often evil)</i></b>. A preacher<br>
 devoid of ambition lacks power. There was a restless spirit in<br>
 Thessalonica because of the misapprehension of the second coming.<br>
 So Paul urges an ambition to be quiet or calm, to lead a quiet<br>
 life, including silence <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:18)</i></b>. <B>{To do your own business}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\prassein ta idia\)</i></b>. Present infinitive like the others, to have<br>
 the habit of attending to their own affairs <b><i>(\ta idia\)</i></b>. This<br>
 restless meddlesomeness here condemned Paul alludes to again in<br>
 <!-#-->2Th 3:11 in plainer terms. It is amazing how much wisdom people<br>
 have about other people's affairs and so little interest in their<br>
 own. <B>{To work with your own hands}</B> <b><i>(\ergazesthai tais chersin<br>
 hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Instrumental case <b><i>(\chersin\)</i></b>. Paul gave a new dignity<br>
 to manual labour by precept and example. There were "pious"<br>
 idlers in the church in Thessalonica who were promoting trouble.<br>
 He had commanded them when with them.<br>
 <br>
 4:12 <B>{That ye may walk honestly}</B> <b><i>(\hina peripat&#275;te eusch&#275;mon&#333;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present subjunctive <b><i>(linear action)</i></b>. Old adverb from \eusch&#275;m&#333;n\<br>
 <b><i>(\eu, sch&#275;ma\, Latin _habitus_, graceful figure)</i></b>, becomingly,<br>
 decently. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ro 13:13. This idea includes<br>
 honest financial transactions, but a good deal more. People<br>
 outside the churches have a right to watch the conduct of<br>
 professing Christians in business, domestic life, social life,<br>
 politics.<br>
 <br>
 4:13 <B>{We would not have}</B> <b><i>(\ou thelomen\)</i></b>. We do not wish. <B>{You<br>
 ignorant}</B> <b><i>(\humas agnoein\)</i></b>. Old word, not to know <b><i>(\a\<br>
 privative, \gno-\, root of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b>. No advantage in ignorance<br>
 of itself. <B>{Concerning them that fall asleep}</B> <b><i>(\peri t&#333;n<br>
 koim&#333;men&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present passive <b><i>(or middle)</i></b> participle <b><i>(Aleph B)</i></b><br>
 rather than the perfect passive \kekoim&#275;men&#333;n\ of many later MSS.<br>
 From old \koima&#333;\, to put to sleep. Present tense gives idea of<br>
 repetition, from time to time fall asleep. Greeks and Romans used<br>
 this figure of sleep for death as Jesus does <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 11:11)</i></b> and<br>
 N.T. generally <b><i>(cf. our word _cemetery_)</i></b>. Somehow the<br>
 Thessalonians had a false notion about the dead in relation to<br>
 the second coming. <B>{Even as the rest which have no hope}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s<br>
 hoi loipoi hoi m&#275; echontes elpida\)</i></b>. This picture of the<br>
 hopelessness of the pagan world about the future life is amply<br>
 illustrated in ancient writings and particularly by inscriptions<br>
 on tombs <b><i>(Milligan)</i></b>. Some few pagans clung to this hope, but most<br>
 had none.<br>
 <br>
 4:14 <B>{For if we believe}</B> <b><i>(\ei gar pisteuomen\)</i></b>. Condition of<br>
 first class, assuming the death and resurrection of Jesus to be<br>
 true. <B>{In Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\dia tou I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. Literally, through or by<br>
 means of Jesus. It is amphibolous in position and can be taken<br>
 either with \tous koim&#275;thentas\ <b><i>(that are fallen asleep in or<br>
 through Jesus)</i></b> like \hoi koim&#275;thentes en Christ&#333;i\ in <!-#-->1Co 15:18<br>
 and probably correct or with \axei\ <b><i>(through Jesus with God)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{With him}</B> <b><i>(\sun aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Together with Jesus. Jesus is the<br>
 connecting link <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> for those that sleep <b><i>(\koim&#275;thentas\<br>
 first aorist passive, but with middle sense)</i></b> and their<br>
 resurrection.<br>
 <br>
 4:15 <B>{By the word of the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\en log&#333;i Kuriou\)</i></b>. We do not<br>
 know to what word of the Lord Jesus Paul refers, probably Paul<br>
 meaning only the point in the teaching of Christ rather than a<br>
 quotation. He may be claiming a direct revelation on this<br>
 important matter as about the Lord's Supper in <!-#-->1Co 11:23. Jesus<br>
 may have spoken on this subject though it has not been preserved<br>
 to us <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mr 9:1)</i></b>. <B>{Ye that are alive}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meis hoi z&#333;ntes\)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul here includes himself, but this by no means shows that Paul<br>
 knew that he would be alive at the Parousia of Christ. He was<br>
 alive, not dead, when he wrote. <B>{Shall in no wise precede}</B> <b><i>(\ou<br>
 m&#275; phthas&#333;men\)</i></b>. Second aorist active subjunctive of \phthan&#333;\,<br>
 to come before, to anticipate. This strong negative with \ou m&#275;\<br>
 <b><i>(double negative)</i></b> and the subjunctive is the regular idiom<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 929)</i></b>. Hence there was no ground for<br>
 uneasiness about the dead in Christ.<br>
 <br>
 4:16 <B>{With a shout}</B> <b><i>(\en keleusmati\)</i></b>. Note this so-called<br>
 instrumental use of \en\. Old word, here only in N.T., from<br>
 \keleu&#333;\, to order, command <b><i>(military command)</i></b>. Christ will come<br>
 as Conqueror. <B>{With the voice of the archangel}</B> <b><i>(\en ph&#333;n&#275;i<br>
 archaggelou\)</i></b>. Further explanation of \keleusmati\ <b><i>(command)</i></b>. The<br>
 only archangel mentioned in N.T. is Michael in <!-#-->Jude 1:9. But<br>
 note absence of article with both \ph&#333;n&#275;i\ and \archaggelou\. The<br>
 reference may be thus indefinite. <B>{With the trump of God}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 salpiggi theou\)</i></b>. Trumpet. See same figure in <!-#-->1Co 15:52. <B>{The<br>
 dead in Christ shall rise first}</B> <b><i>(\hoi nekroi en Christ&#333;i<br>
 anast&#275;sontai pr&#333;ton\)</i></b>. <B>{First}</B> here refers plainly to the fact<br>
 that, so far from the dead in Christ having no share in the<br>
 Parousia, they will rise before those still alive are changed.<br>
 <br>
 4:17 <B>{Then}</B> <b><i>(\epeita\)</i></b>. The next step, not the identical time<br>
 <b><i>(\tote\)</i></b>, but immediately afterwards. <B>{Together with them}</B> <b><i>(\hama<br>
 sun autois\)</i></b>. Note both \hama\ <b><i>(at the same time)</i></b> and \sun\<br>
 <b><i>(together with)</i></b> with the associative instrumental case \autois\<br>
 <b><i>(the risen saints)</i></b>. <B>{Shall be caught up}</B> <b><i>(\harpag&#275;sometha\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second future passive indicative of \harpaz&#333;\, old verb to seize,<br>
 to carry off like Latin _rapio_. <B>{To meet the Lord in the air}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eis apant&#275;sin tou Kuriou eis aera\)</i></b>. This special Greek idiom<br>
 is common in the LXX like the Hebrew, but Polybius has it also<br>
 and it occurs in the papyri <b><i>(Moulton, _Proleg_., p. 14, n. 3)</i></b>.<br>
 This rapture of the saints <b><i>(both risen and changed)</i></b> is a glorious<br>
 climax to Paul's argument of consolation. <B>{And so}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 hout&#333;s\)</i></b>. This is the outcome, to be forever with the Lord,<br>
 whether with a return to earth or with an immediate departure for<br>
 heaven Paul does not say. To be with Christ is the chief hope of<br>
 Paul's life <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 5:10; Php 1:23; Col 3:4; 2Co 5:8)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:18 <B>{With these words}</B> <b><i>(\en tois logois toutois\)</i></b>. In these<br>
 words. They were a comfort to the Thessalonians as they still<br>
 comfort the people of God.<br>
