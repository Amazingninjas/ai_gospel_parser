 <HR>
<p>12:1 <B>{I must needs glory}</B> <b><i>(\kauchasthai dei\)</i></b>. This is the<br>
 reading of B L Latin Syriac, but Aleph D Bohairic have \de\ while<br>
 K M read \d&#275;\. The first is probably correct. He must go on with<br>
 the glorying already begun, foolish as it is, though it is not<br>
 expedient <b><i>(\ou sumpheron\)</i></b>. <B>{Visions}</B> <b><i>(\optasias\)</i></b>. Late word<br>
 from \optaz&#333;\. See on &#175;Lu 1:22; Ac 26:19. <B>{Revelations of the<br>
 Lord}</B> <b><i>(\apokalupseis Kuriou\)</i></b>. Unveilings <b><i>(from \apokalupt&#333;\ as<br>
 in <!-#-->Re 1:1)</i></b>. See on &#175;2Th 1:7; 1Co 1:7; 14:26. Paul had both<br>
 repeated visions of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 9:3; 16:9; 18:9; 22:17; 27:23f.)</i></b><br>
 and revelations. He claimed to speak by direct revelation <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 11:23; 15:3; Ga 1:12; Eph 3:3, etc.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:2 <B>{I know a man}</B> <b><i>(\oida anthr&#333;pon\)</i></b>. Paul singles out one<br>
 incident of ecstasy in his own experience that he declines to<br>
 describe. He alludes to it in this indirect way as if it were<br>
 some other personality. <B>{Fourteen years ago}</B> <b><i>(\pro et&#333;n<br>
 dekatessar&#333;n\)</i></b>. Idiomatic way of putting it, the preposition<br>
 \pro\ <b><i>(before)</i></b> before the date <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar, p. 621f.)</i></b> as<br>
 in <!-#-->Joh 12:1. The date was probably while Paul was at Tarsus<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 9:30; 11:25)</i></b>. We have no details of that period. <B>{Caught<br>
 up}</B> <b><i>(\harpagenta\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive participle of<br>
 \harpaz&#333;\, to seize <b><i>(see on <!-#-->Mt 11:12)</i></b>. <B>{Even to the third<br>
 heaven}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s tritou ouranou\)</i></b>. It is unlikely that Paul alludes<br>
 to the idea of seven heavens held by some Jews <b><i>(_Test. of the<br>
 Twelve Pat._, Levi ii. iii.)</i></b>. He seems to mean the highest heaven<br>
 where God is <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:3 <B>{I do not know}</B> <b><i>(\ouk oida\)</i></b>. Paul declines to pass on his<br>
 precise condition in this trance. We had best leave it as he has<br>
 told it.<br>
 <br>
 12:4 <B>{Into Paradise}</B> <b><i>(\eis paradeison\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Lu 23:43 for<br>
 this interesting word. Paul apparently uses paradise as the<br>
 equivalent of the third heaven in verse <!-#-->2. Some Jews <b><i>(_Book of<br>
 the Secrets of Enoch_, chapter viii)</i></b> make Paradise in the third<br>
 heaven. The rabbis had various ideas <b><i>(two heavens, three, seven)</i></b>.<br>
 We need not commit Paul to any "celestial gradation" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Unspeakable words}</B> <b><i>(\arr&#275;ta r&#275;mata\)</i></b>. Old verbal adjective <b><i>(\a\<br>
 privative, \r&#275;tos\ from \re&#333;\)</i></b>, only here in N.T. <B>{Not lawful}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ouk exon\)</i></b>. Copula \estin\ omitted. Hence Paul does <B>{not}</B> give<br>
 these words.<br>
 <br>
 12:5 <B>{But on mine own behalf}</B> <b><i>(\huper de emautou\)</i></b>. As if there<br>
 were two Pauls. In a sense there were. He will only glory in the<br>
 things mentioned above, the things of his weaknesses <b><i>(<!-#-->11:30)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:6 <B>{I shall not be foolish}</B> <b><i>(\ouk esomai aphr&#333;n\)</i></b>. Apparent<br>
 contradiction to <!-#-->11:1,16. But he is here speaking of the Paul<br>
 "caught up" in case he should tell the things heard <b><i>(condition of<br>
 the third class, \ean\ and first aorist subjunctive \thel&#275;s&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Of me}</B> <b><i>(\eis eme\)</i></b>. To my credit, almost like dative <b><i>(cf. \en<br>
 emoi\ in <!-#-->1Co 14:11)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:7 <B>{By reason of the exceeding greatness}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i huperbol&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Instrumental case, "by the excess." <B>{That I should not be exalted<br>
 overmuch}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275; huperair&#333;mai\)</i></b>. Present passive subjunctive<br>
 in final clause of \huperair&#333;\, old verb to lift up beyond, only<br>
 here in N.T. This clause is repeated at the end of the sentence.<br>
 <B>{A thorn in the flesh}</B> <b><i>(\skolops t&#275;i sarki\)</i></b>. This old word is<br>
 used for splinter, stake, thorn. In the papyri and inscriptions<br>
 examples occur both for splinter and thorn as the meaning. In the<br>
 LXX it is usually thorn. The case of \t&#275;i sarki\ can be either<br>
 locative <b><i>(in)</i></b> or dative <b><i>(for)</i></b>. What was it? Certainly it was some<br>
 physical malady that persisted. All sorts of theories are held<br>
 <b><i>(malaria, eye-trouble, epilepsy, insomnia, migraine or<br>
 sick-headache, etc.)</i></b>. It is a blessing to the rest of us that we<br>
 do not know the particular affliction that so beset Paul. Each of<br>
 us has some such splinter or thorn in the flesh, perhaps several<br>
 at once. <B>{Messenger of Satan}</B> <b><i>(\aggelos Satana\)</i></b>. Angel of Satan,<br>
 the affliction personified. <B>{Buffet}</B> <b><i>(\kolaphiz&#275;i\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt<br>
 26:67; 1Co 4:11 for this late and rare word from \kolaphos\,<br>
 fist. The messenger of Satan kept slapping Paul in the face and<br>
 Paul now sees that it was God's will for it to be so.<br>
 <br>
 12:8 <B>{Concerning this thing}</B> <b><i>(\huper toutou\)</i></b>. More likely,<br>
 "concerning this messenger of Satan." <B>{That it might depart from<br>
 me}</B> <b><i>(\hina apost&#275;i aph' emou\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b> subjunctive of \aphist&#275;mi\ in final clause, "that<br>
 he stand off from me for good."<br>
 <br>
 12:9 <B>{He hath said}</B> <b><i>(\eir&#275;ken\)</i></b>. Perfect active indicative, as if<br>
 a final word. Paul probably still has the thorn in his flesh and<br>
 needs this word of Christ. <B>{Is sufficient}</B> <b><i>(\arkei\)</i></b>. Old word of<br>
 rich meaning, perhaps kin to Latin _arceo_, to ward off against<br>
 danger. Christ's grace suffices and abides. <B>{Is perfected}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\teleitai\)</i></b>. Present passive indicative of \tele&#333;\, to finish.<br>
 It is linear in idea. Power is continually increased as the<br>
 weakness grows. See <!-#-->Php 4:13 for this same noble conception.<br>
 The human weakness opens the way for more of Christ's power and<br>
 grace. <B>{Most gladly rather}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;dista mallon\)</i></b>. Two adverbs, one<br>
 superlative <b><i>(\h&#275;dista\)</i></b>, one comparative <b><i>(\mallon\)</i></b>. "Rather"<br>
 than ask any more <b><i>(thrice already)</i></b> for the removal of the thorn<br>
 or splinter "most gladly will I glory in my weaknesses." Slowly<br>
 Paul had learned this supreme lesson, but it will never leave him<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 5:2; 2Ti 4:6-8)</i></b>. <B>{May rest upon me}</B> <b><i>(\episk&#275;n&#333;s&#275;i ep'<br>
 eme\)</i></b>. Late and rare verb in first aorist active subjunctive with<br>
 \hina\ <b><i>(final clause)</i></b>, to fix a tent upon, here upon Paul himself<br>
 by a bold metaphor, as if the Shechinah of the Lord was<br>
 overshadowing him <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Lu 9:34)</i></b>, the power <b><i>(\dunamis\)</i></b> of the<br>
 Lord Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 12:10 <B>{Wherefore I take pleasure}</B> <b><i>(\dio eudok&#333;\)</i></b>. For this noble<br>
 word see on &#175;Mt 3:17; 2Co 5:8. The enemies of Paul will have a<br>
 hard time now in making Paul unhappy by persecutions even unto<br>
 death <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 1:20-26)</i></b>. He is not courting martyrdom, but he does<br>
 not fear it or anything that is "for Christ's sake" <b><i>(\huper<br>
 Christou\)</i></b>. <B>{For when}</B> <b><i>(\hotan gar\)</i></b>. "For whenever," indefinite<br>
 time. <B>{Then I am strong}</B> <b><i>(\tote dunatos eimi\)</i></b>. At that very<br>
 time, but not in myself, but in the fresh access of power from<br>
 Christ for the emergency.<br>
 <br>
 12:11 <B>{I am become foolish}</B> <b><i>(\gegona aphr&#333;n\)</i></b>. Perfect active<br>
 indicative of \ginomai\. In spite of what he said in verse <!-#-->6<br>
 that he would not be foolish if he gloried in the other Paul. But<br>
 he feels that he has dropped back to the mood of <!-#-->11:1,16. He<br>
 has been swept on by the memory of the ecstasy. <B>{For I ought to<br>
 have been commended by you}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; gar &#333;pheilon huph' hum&#333;n<br>
 sunistasthai\)</i></b>. Explanation of "ye compelled me." Imperfect<br>
 active \&#333;pheilon\ of \opheil&#333;\, to be under obligation, and the<br>
 tense here expresses an unfulfilled obligation about the present.<br>
 But \sunistasthai\ is present passive infinitive, not aorist or<br>
 perfect passive. He literally means, "I ought now to be commended<br>
 by you" instead of having to glorify myself. He repeats his boast<br>
 already made <b><i>(<!-#-->11:5f.)</i></b>, that he is no whit behind "the<br>
 super-extra apostles" <b><i>(the Judaizers)</i></b>, "though I am nothing" <b><i>(\ei<br>
 kai ouden eimi\)</i></b>. Even boasting himself against those false<br>
 apostles causes a reaction of feeling that he has to express <b><i>(cf.<br>
 <!-#-->1Co 15:9; 1Ti 1:15f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:12 <B>{Of an apostle}</B> <b><i>(\tou apostolou\)</i></b>. "Of the apostle"<br>
 <b><i>(definite article)</i></b>. Note the three words here for miracles<br>
 wrought by Paul <b><i>(\s&#275;meia\, signs, \terata\, wonders, \dunameis\,<br>
 powers or miracles)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Heb 2:4.<br>
 <br>
 12:13 <B>{Wherein ye were made inferior}</B> <b><i>(\ho h&#275;ss&#333;th&#275;te\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive indicative of \h&#275;ssoomai\, the text of Aleph B D<br>
 instead of the usual \h&#275;tt&#275;th&#275;te\ from the common \h&#275;ttaomai\ to<br>
 be inferior or less from the comparative \h&#275;tt&#333;n\. See \h&#275;ss&#333;n\<br>
 in verse <!-#-->15. \Ho\ is the neuter accusative with the passive<br>
 verb <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 479)</i></b>. <B>{Forgive me this wrong}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\charisasthe moi t&#275;n adikian taut&#275;n\)</i></b>. Consummate irony to the<br>
 stingy element in this church <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->11:9)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:14 <B>{Third time I am ready to come}</B> <b><i>(\triton touto hetoim&#333;s<br>
 ech&#333;\)</i></b>. Had he been already twice or only once? He had changed<br>
 his plans once when he did not go <b><i>(<!-#-->1:15f.)</i></b>. He will not change<br>
 his plans now. This looks as if he had only been once <b><i>(that in<br>
 <!-#-->Ac 18)</i></b>. Note the third use of \katanarka&#333;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->11:9; 12:13,14)</i></b>.<br>
 They need not be apprehensive. He will be as financially<br>
 independent of them as before. "I shall not sponge on you." <B>{Not<br>
 yours, but you}</B> <b><i>(\ou ta hum&#333;n, alla humas\)</i></b>. The motto of every<br>
 real preacher. <B>{To lay up}</B> <b><i>(\th&#275;saurizein\)</i></b>. For this use of the<br>
 verb see <!-#-->1Co 16:2 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 6:19-21; Jas 5:3)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:15 <B>{I will most gladly spend and be spent}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;dista dapan&#275;s&#333;<br>
 kai ekdapan&#275;th&#275;somai\)</i></b>. Both future active of old verb \dapana&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 5:26)</i></b> to spend money, time, energy, strength and the future<br>
 passive of \ekdapana&#333;\, late compound to spend utterly, to spend<br>
 out, <b><i>(\ek-\)</i></b>, to spend wholly. Only here in N.T.<br>
 <br>
 12:16 <B>{I did not myself burden you}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; ou katebar&#275;sa humas\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active of late verb \katabare&#333;\, to press a burden<br>
 down on one. Only here in N.T. <B>{Crafty}</B> <b><i>(\panourgos\)</i></b>. Old word<br>
 from \pan\, all, and \ergo\, to do anything <b><i>(good or bad)</i></b>. Good<br>
 sense is skilful, bad sense cunning. Only here in N.T. and Paul<br>
 is quoting the word from his enemies. <B>{With guile}</B> <b><i>(\dol&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Instrumental case of \dolos\, bait to catch fish with. The<br>
 enemies of Paul said that he was raising this big collection for<br>
 himself. Moffatt has done well to put these charges in quotation<br>
 marks to make it plain to readers that Paul is ironical.<br>
 <br>
 12:17 <B>{Did I take advantage}</B> <b><i>(\epleonekt&#275;sa\)</i></b>. Paul goes right to<br>
 the point without hedging. For this verb from \pleon\ and \ech&#333;\,<br>
 to have more, see on &#175;2Co 2:11; 7:2. <B>{By any one of them}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\tina--di' autou\)</i></b>. An anacoluthon for \tina\ is left in the<br>
 accusative without a verb and \di' autou\ takes up the idea, "as<br>
 to any one by him." <B>{Whom}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;n\)</i></b>. The genitive relative is<br>
 attracted from the accusative \hous\ into the case of the<br>
 unexpressed antecedent \touton\)</i></b>. \M&#275;\ expects the negative<br>
 answer as does \m&#275;ti\ in <!-#-->18.<br>
 <br>
 12:18 <B>{The brother}</B> <b><i>(\ton adelphon\)</i></b>. Probably the brother of<br>
 Titus <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->8:18)</i></b>. <B>{Did Titus take advantage of you?}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;ti<br>
 epleonekt&#275;sen humas Titos?\)</i></b>. That puts the issue squarely. <B>{By<br>
 the same Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i aut&#333;i pneumati\)</i></b>. That translation refers<br>
 to the Holy Spirit and makes the case instrumental. The locative<br>
 case, "in the same spirit," makes it mean that Paul's attitude is<br>
 the same as that of Titus and most likely is correct, for "in the<br>
 same steps" <b><i>(\tois autois ichnesin\)</i></b> is in locative case.<br>
 <br>
 12:19 <B>{Ye think all this time}</B> <b><i>(\palai dokeite\)</i></b>. Progressive<br>
 present indicative, "for a long time ye have been thinking." <B>{We<br>
 are excusing ourselves}</B> <b><i>(\apologoumetha\)</i></b>. He is not just<br>
 apologizing, but is in deadly earnest, as they will find out when<br>
 he comes.<br>
 <br>
 12:20 <B>{Lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such<br>
 as I would}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; p&#333;s elth&#333;n ouch hoious thel&#333; heur&#333; humas\)</i></b>. An<br>
 idiomatic construction after the verb of fearing <b><i>(\phoboumai\)</i></b><br>
 with \m&#275; p&#333;s\ as the conjunction and with \ouch\ as the negative<br>
 of the verb \heur&#333;\ <b><i>(second aorist active subjunctive of<br>
 \heurisk&#333;\)</i></b>, \m&#275;\ the conjunction, \ouch\ the negative. See<br>
 Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 995.  <B>{And I be found}</B> <b><i>(\kag&#333;<br>
 heureth&#333;\)</i></b>. Same construction with first aorist passive<br>
 subjunctive. <B>{Such as ye would not}</B> <b><i>(\hoion ou thelete\)</i></b>. Neat<br>
 change in voice just before and position of the negative here.<br>
 <B>{Lest by any means}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; p&#333;s\)</i></b>. Still further negative purpose by<br>
 repeating the conjunction. With graphic pen pictures Paul<br>
 describes what had been going on against him during his long<br>
 absence. <B>{Backbitings}</B> <b><i>(\katalaliai\)</i></b>. Late and rare word. In<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->1Pe 2:1. If it only existed nowhere else!<br>
 <B>{Whisperings}</B> <b><i>(\psithurismoi\)</i></b>. Late word from \psithuriz&#333;\, to<br>
 whisper into one's ear. An onomatopoetic word for the sibilant<br>
 murmur of a snake charmer <b><i>(<!-#-->Ec 10:11)</i></b>. Only here in N.T.<br>
 <B>{Swellings}</B> <b><i>(\phusi&#333;seis\)</i></b>. From \phusio&#333;\, to swell up, late<br>
 word only here and in ecclesiastical writers. Did Paul make up<br>
 the word for the occasion? See on &#175;1Co 4:6 for verb. <B>{Tumults}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\akatastasiai\)</i></b>. See on <!-#-->2Co 6:5.<br>
 <br>
 12:21 <B>{When I come again}</B> <b><i>(\palin elthontos mou\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute. Paul assumes it as true. <B>{Lest my God humble me}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;<br>
 tapein&#333;s&#275;i me ho theos mou\)</i></b>. Negative final clause <b><i>(\m&#275;\ and<br>
 first aorist active subjunctive)</i></b>, going back to \phoboumai\ in<br>
 <!-#-->20. He means a public humiliation as his fear. The conduct of<br>
 the church had been a real humiliation whether he refers to a<br>
 previous visit or not. <B>{That have sinned heretofore}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n<br>
 pro&#275;mart&#275;kot&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive plural of the articular perfect active<br>
 participle of \proamartan&#333;\ to emphasize continuance of their<br>
 sinful state as opposed to \m&#275; metano&#275;sant&#333;n\ <b><i>(did not repent)</i></b> in<br>
 the aorist tense.<br>
