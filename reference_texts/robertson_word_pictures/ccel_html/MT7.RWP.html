</TD></TR></TABLE>
 <HR>
<p>7:1 <B>{Judge not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; krinete\)</i></b>. The habit of censoriousness,<br>
 sharp, unjust criticism. Our word critic is from this very word.<br>
 It means to separate, distinguish, discriminate. That is<br>
 necessary, but pre-judice <b><i>(prejudgment)</i></b> is unfair, captious<br>
 criticism.<br>
 <br>
 7:3 <B>{The mote}</B> <b><i>(\to karphos\)</i></b>. Not dust, but a piece of dried<br>
 wood or chaff, splinter <b><i>(Weymouth, Moffatt)</i></b>, speck <b><i>(Goodspeed)</i></b>, a<br>
 very small particle that may irritate. <B>{The beam}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n dokon\)</i></b>.<br>
 A log on which planks in the house rest <b><i>(so papyri)</i></b>, joist,<br>
 rafter, plank <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>, pole sticking out grotesquely. Probably<br>
 a current proverb quoted by Jesus like our people in glass houses<br>
 throwing stones. Tholuck quotes an Arabic proverb: "How seest<br>
 thou the splinter in thy brother's eye, and seest not the<br>
 cross-beam in thine eye?"<br>
 <br>
 7:5 <B>{Shalt thou see clearly}</B> <b><i>(\diablepseis\)</i></b>. Only here and <!-#-->Lu<br>
 6:42 and <!-#-->Mr 8:25 in the New Testament. Look through, penetrate<br>
 in contrast to \blepeis\, to gaze at, in verse <!-#-->3. Get the log<br>
 out of your eye and you will see clearly how to help the brother<br>
 get the splinter out <b><i>(\ekbalein\)</i></b> of his eye.<br>
 <br>
 7:6 <B>{That which is holy unto the dogs}</B> <b><i>(\to hagion tois kusin\)</i></b>.<br>
 It is not clear to what "the holy" refers, to ear-rings or to<br>
 amulets, but that would not appeal to dogs. Trench <b><i>(_Sermon on<br>
 the Mount_, p. 136)</i></b> says that the reference is to meat offered in<br>
 sacrifice that must not be flung to dogs: "It is not that the<br>
 dogs would not eat it, for it would be welcome to them; but that<br>
 it would be a profanation to give it to them, thus to make it a<br>
 _skubalon_, <!-#-->Ex 22:31." The yelping dogs would jump at it. Dogs<br>
 are kin to wolves and infest the streets of oriental cities.<br>
 <B>{Your pearls before the swine}</B> <b><i>(\tous margaritas h&#8211;m&#333;n emprosthen<br>
 t&#333;n choir&#333;n\)</i></b>. The word pearl we have in the name Margarita<br>
 <b><i>(Margaret)</i></b>. Pearls look a bit like peas or acorns and would<br>
 deceive the hogs until they discovered the deception. The wild<br>
 boars haunt the Jordan Valley still and are not far removed from<br>
 bears as they trample with their feet and rend with their tusks<br>
 those who have angered them.<br>
 <br>
 7:9 <B>{Loaf--stone}</B> <b><i>(\arton--lithon\)</i></b>. Some stones look like loaves<br>
 of bread. So the devil suggested that Jesus make loaves out of<br>
 stones <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 4:3)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:10 <B>{Fish--serpent}</B> <b><i>(\ichthun--ophin\)</i></b>. Fish, common article of<br>
 food, and water-snakes could easily be substituted. Anacoluthon<br>
 in this sentence in the Greek.<br>
 <br>
 7:11 <B>{How much more}</B> <b><i>(\pos&#333;i mallon\)</i></b>. Jesus is fond of the _a<br>
 fortiori_ argument.<br>
 <br>
 7:12 <B>{That men should do unto you}</B> <b><i>(\hina poi&#333;sin h&#8211;m&#338;n hoi<br>
 anthr&#333;poi\)</i></b>. Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:31)</i></b> puts the Golden Rule parallel with<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 5:42. The negative form is in Tobit 4:15. It was used by<br>
 Hillel, Philo, Isocrates, Confucius. "The Golden Rule is the<br>
 distilled essence of that 'fulfilment' <b><i>(<!-#-->5:17)</i></b> which is taught<br>
 in the sermon" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. Jesus puts it in positive form.<br>
 <br>
 7:13 <B>{By the narrow gate}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#275;s sten&#275;s pul&#275;s\)</i></b>. The<br>
 Authorized Version "at the strait gate" misled those who did not<br>
 distinguish between "strait" and "straight." The figure of the<br>
 Two Ways had a wide circulation in Jewish and Christian writings<br>
 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->De 30:19; Jer 21:8; Ps 1)</i></b>. See the _Didache_ i-vi;<br>
 Barnabas xviii-xx. "The narrow gate" is repeated in verse <!-#-->14<br>
 and <B>{straitened the way}</B> <b><i>(\tethlimmen&#275; h&#275; hodos\)</i></b> added. The way<br>
 is "compressed," narrowed as in a defile between high rocks, a<br>
 tight place like \stenoch&#333;ria\ in <!-#-->Ro 8:35. "The way that leads<br>
 to life involves straits and afflictions" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. Vincent<br>
 quotes the _Pinax_ or _Tablet_ of Cebes, a contemporary of<br>
 Socrates: "Seest thou not, then, a little door, and a way before<br>
 the door, which is not much crowded, but very few travel it? This<br>
 is the way that leadeth unto true culture." "The broad way"<br>
 <b><i>(\euruch&#333;ros\)</i></b> is in every city, town, village, with the glaring<br>
 white lights that lure to destruction.<br>
 <br>
 7:15 <B>{False prophets}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n pseudoproph&#275;t&#333;n\)</i></b>. There were false<br>
 prophets in the time of the Old Testament prophets. Jesus will<br>
 predict "false Messiahs and false prophets" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 24:24)</i></b> who will<br>
 lead many astray. They came in due time posing as angels of light<br>
 like Satan, Judaizers <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:13ff.)</i></b> and Gnostics <b><i>(<!-#-->1Jo 4:1;<br>
 1Ti 4:1)</i></b>. Already false prophets were on hand when Jesus spoke<br>
 on this occasion <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ac 13:6; 2Pe 2:1)</i></b>. In outward appearance<br>
 they look like sheep in the sheep's clothing which they wear, but<br>
 within they are "ravening wolves" <b><i>(\lukoi harpages\)</i></b>, greedy for<br>
 power, gain, self. It is a tragedy that such men and women<br>
 reappear through the ages and always find victims. Wolves are<br>
 more dangerous than dogs and hogs.<br>
 <br>
 7:16 <B>{By their fruits ye shall know them}</B> <b><i>(\apo t&#333;n karp&#333;n aut&#333;n<br>
 epign&#333;sesthe\)</i></b>. From their fruits you will recognize them." The<br>
 verb "know " <b><i>(\gin&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b> has \epi\ added, fully know. The<br>
 illustrations from the trees and vines have many parallels in<br>
 ancient writers.<br>
 <br>
 7:20 See on &#175;Mt 7:16.<br>
 <br>
 7:21 <B>{Not--but}</B> <b><i>(\ou--all'\)</i></b>. Sharp contrast between the mere<br>
 talker and the doer of God's will.<br>
 <br>
 7:22 <B>{Did we not prophesy in thy name?}</B> <b><i>(\ou t&#333;i s&#333;i onomati<br>
 eproph&#275;teusamen;\)</i></b>. The use of \ou\ in the question expects the<br>
 affirmative answer. They claim to have prophesied <b><i>(preached)</i></b> in<br>
 Christ's name and to have done many miracles. But Jesus will tear<br>
 off the sheepskin and lay bare the ravening wolf. "I never knew<br>
 you" <b><i>(\oudepote egn&#333;n h&#8211;m&#257;s\)</i></b>. "I was never acquainted with you"<br>
 <b><i>(experimental knowledge)</i></b>. Success, as the world counts it, is not<br>
 a criterion of one's knowledge of Christ and relation to him. "I<br>
 will profess unto them" <b><i>(\homolog&#275;s&#333; autois\)</i></b>, the very word used<br>
 of profession of Christ before men <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:32)</i></b>. This word Jesus<br>
 will use for public and open announcement of their doom.<br>
 <br>
 7:24 <B>{And doeth them}</B> <b><i>(\kai poiei autous\)</i></b>. That is the point in<br>
 the parable of the wise builder, "who digged and went deep, and<br>
 laid a foundation upon the rock" <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:48)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:25 <B>{Was founded}</B> <b><i>(\tethemeli&#333;to\)</i></b>. Past perfect indicative<br>
 passive state of completion in the past. It had been built upon<br>
 the rock and it stood. No augment.<br>
 <br>
 7:26 <B>{And doeth them not}</B> <b><i>(\kai m&#275; poi&#333;n autous\)</i></b>. The foolish<br>
 builder put his house on the sands that could not hold in the<br>
 storm. One is reminded of the words of Jesus at the beginning of<br>
 the Sermon in <!-#-->5:19 about the one "who does and teaches."<br>
 Hearing sermons is a dangerous business if one does not put them<br>
 into practice.<br>
 <br>
 7:28 <B>{The multitudes were astonished}</B> <b><i>(\exepl&#275;ssonto hoi<br>
 ochloi\)</i></b>. They listened spell-bound to the end and were left<br>
 amazed. Note the imperfect tense, a buzz of astonishment. The<br>
 verb means literally "were struck out of themselves."<br>
 <br>
 7:29 <B>{And not as their scribes}</B> <b><i>(\kai ouch h&#333;s hoi grammateis<br>
 aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. They had heard many sermons before from the regular<br>
 rabbis in the synagogues. We have specimens of these discourses<br>
 preserved in the Mishna and Gemara, the Jewish Talmud when both<br>
 were completed, the driest, dullest collection of disjounted<br>
 comments upon every conceivable problem in the history of<br>
 mankind. The scribes quoted the rabbis before them and were<br>
 afraid to express an idea without bolstering it up by some<br>
 predecessor. Jesus spoke with the authority of truth, the reality<br>
 and freshness of the morning light, and the power of God's<br>
 Spirit. This sermon which made such a profound impression ended<br>
 with the tragedy of the fall of the house on the sand like the<br>
 crash of a giant oak in the forest. There was no smoothing over<br>
 the outcome.<br>
