<p>2:1 <B>{Decree from Caesar Augustus}</B> <b><i>(\dogma para Kaisaros<br>
 Augoustou\)</i></b>. Old and common word from \doke&#333;\, to think, form an<br>
 opinion. No such decree was given by Greek or Roman historians<br>
 and it was for long assumed by many scholars that Luke was in<br>
 error. But papyri and inscriptions have confirmed Luke on every<br>
 point in these crucial verses <!-#-->2:1-7. See W.M. Ramsay's books<br>
 <b><i>(_Was Christ Born at Bethelehem?_ _Luke the Physician_. _The<br>
 Bearing of Recent Discovery on the Trustworthiness of the N.T._)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{The World}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n oikoumen&#275;n\)</i></b>. Literally, <B>{the inhabited}</B><br>
 <b><i>(<B>{land}</B>, \g&#275;n\)</i></b>. Inhabited by the Greeks, then by the Romans,<br>
 then the whole world <b><i>(Roman world, the world ruled by Rome)</i></b>. So<br>
 <!-#-->Ac 11:28; 17:6. <B>{Should be enrolled}</B> <b><i>(\apographesthai\)</i></b>. It was<br>
 a census, not a taxing, though taxing generally followed and was<br>
 based on the census. This word is very old and common. It means<br>
 to write or copy off for the public records, to register.<br>
 <br>
 2:2 <B>{The first enrolment}</B> <b><i>(\apograph&#275; pr&#333;t&#275;\)</i></b>. A definite<br>
 allusion by Luke to a series of censuses instituted by Augustus,<br>
 the second of which is mentioned by him in <!-#-->Ac 5:37. This second<br>
 one is described by Josephus and it was supposed by some that<br>
 Luke confused the two. But Ramsay has shown that a periodical<br>
 fourteen-year census in Egypt is given in dated papyri back to<br>
 A.D. 20. The one in <!-#-->Ac 5:37 would then be A.D. 6. This is in<br>
 the time of Augustus. The first would then be B.C. 8 in Egypt. If<br>
 it was delayed a couple of years in Palestine by Herod the Great<br>
 for obvious reasons, that would make the birth of Christ about<br>
 B.C. 6 which agrees with the other known data <B>{When Quirinius}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Kur&#275;niou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute. Here again Luke has been<br>
 attacked on the ground that Quirinius was only governor of Syria<br>
 once and that was A.D. 6 as shown by Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. XVIII.<br>
 I.I)</i></b>. But Ramsay has proven by inscriptions that Quirinius was<br>
 twice in Syria and that Luke is correct here also. See summary of<br>
 the facts in my _Luke the Historian in the Light of Research_,<br>
 pp. 118-29.<br>
 <br>
 2:3 <B>{Each to his own city}</B> <b><i>(\hekastos eis t&#275;n heautou polin\)</i></b>. A<br>
 number of papyri in Egypt have the heading enrolment by household<br>
 <b><i>(\apograph&#275; kat' oikian\)</i></b>. Here again Luke is vindicated. Each<br>
 man went to the town where his family register was kept.<br>
 <br>
 2:5 <B>{To enrol himself with Mary}</B> <b><i>(\apograpsasthai sun Mariam\)</i></b>.<br>
 Direct middle. "With Mary" is naturally taken with the infinitive<br>
 as here. If so, that means that Mary's family register was in<br>
 Bethlehem also and that she also belonged to the house of David.<br>
 It is possible to connect "with Mary" far back with "went up"<br>
 <b><i>(\aneb&#275;\)</i></b> in verse <!-#-->4, but it is unnatural to do so. There is no<br>
 real reason for doubting that Mary herself was a descendant of<br>
 David and that is the obvious way to understand Luke's genealogy<br>
 of Jesus in <!-#-->Lu 3:23-38). The Syriac Sinaitic expressly says<br>
 that both Joseph and Mary were of the house and city of David.<br>
 <B>{Betrothed}</B> <b><i>(\emn&#275;steumen&#275;n\)</i></b>. Same verb as in <!-#-->1:27, but here<br>
 it really means "married" or "espoused" as <!-#-->Mt 1:24f. shows.<br>
 Otherwise she could not have travelled with Joseph. <B>{Great with<br>
 child}</B> <b><i>(\enku&#333;i\)</i></b>. Only here in N.T. Common Greek word.<br>
 <br>
 2:6 <B>{That she should be delivered}</B> <b><i>(\tou tekein aut&#275;n\)</i></b>. <B>{For the<br>
 bearing the child as to her}</B>. A neat use of the articular<br>
 infinitive, second aorist active, with the accusative of general<br>
 reference. From \tikt&#333;\, common verb.<br>
 <br>
 2:7 <B>{Her firstborn}</B> <b><i>(\ton pr&#333;totokon\)</i></b>. The expression naturally<br>
 means that she afterwards had other children and we read of<br>
 brothers and sisters of Jesus. There is not a particle of<br>
 evidence for the notion that Mary refused to bear other children<br>
 because she was the mother of the Messiah. <B>{Wrapped in swaddling<br>
 clothes}</B> <b><i>(\espargan&#333;sen\)</i></b>. From \sparganon\, a swathing band.<br>
 Only here and verse <!-#-->12 in the N.T., but in Euripides,<br>
 Aristotle, Hippocrates, Plutarch. Frequent in medical works. <B>{In<br>
 a manger}</B> <b><i>(\en phatn&#275;i\)</i></b>. In a crib in a stall whether in a cave<br>
 <b><i>(Justin Martyr)</i></b> or connected with the inn we do not know. The<br>
 cattle may have been out on the hills or the donkeys used in<br>
 travelling may have been feeding in this stall or another near.<br>
 <B>{In the inn}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i katalumati\)</i></b>. A lodging-house or khan, poor<br>
 enough at best, but there was not even room in this public place<br>
 because of the crowds for the census. See the word also in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 22:11; Mr 14:14 with the sense of guest-room <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1Ki 1:13)</i></b>.<br>
 It is the Hellenistic equivalent for \katag&#333;geion\ and appears<br>
 also in one papyrus. See <!-#-->Ex 4:24. There would sometimes be an<br>
 inner court, a range or arches, an open gallery round the four<br>
 sides. On one side of the square, outside the wall, would be<br>
 stables for the asses and camels, buffaloes and goats. Each man<br>
 had to carry his own food and bedding.<br>
 <br>
 2:8 <B>{Abiding in the field}</B> <b><i>(\agraulountes\)</i></b>. From \agros\, field<br>
 and \aul&#275;\, court. The shepherds were making the field their<br>
 court. Plutarch and Strabo use the word. <B>{Keeping watch}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\phulassontes phulakas\)</i></b>. Cognate accusative. They were<br>
 bivouacking by night and it was plainly mild weather. In these<br>
 very pastures David had fought the lion and the bear to protect<br>
 the sheep <b><i>(<!-#-->1Sa 17:34f.)</i></b>. The plural here probably means that<br>
 they watched by turns. The flock may have been meant for the<br>
 temple sacrifices. There is no way to tell.<br>
 <br>
 2:9 <B>{Stood by them}</B> <b><i>(\epest&#275; autois\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist active<br>
 indicative. Stepped by their side. The same word in <!-#-->Ac 12:7 of<br>
 the angel there. Paul uses it in the sense of standing by in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 22:20. It is a common old Greek word, \ephist&#275;mi\. <B>{Were sore<br>
 afraid}</B> <b><i>(\ephob&#275;th&#275;san phobon megan\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative with cognate accusative <b><i>(the passive sense gone)</i></b>, they<br>
 feared a great fear.<br>
 <br>
 2:10 <B>{I bring you good tidings of great joy}</B> <b><i>(\euaggelizomai<br>
 h&#8211;min charan megal&#275;n\)</i></b>. Wycliff, "I evangelize to you a great<br>
 joy." The active verb \euaggeliz&#333;\ occurs only in late Greek<br>
 writers, LXX, a few papyri examples, and the N.T. The middle<br>
 <b><i>(deponent)</i></b> appears from Aristophanes on. Luke and Paul employ<br>
 both substantive \euaggelion\ and verb \euaggeliz&#333;\ very<br>
 frequently. It is to Paul's influence that we owe their frequency<br>
 and popularity in the language of Christendom <b><i>(George Milligan,<br>
 _The Epistles to the Thessalonians_, p. 143)</i></b>. The other Gospels<br>
 do not have the verb save <!-#-->Mt 11:5 and that in a quotation <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa<br>
 61:1)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:11 \Is born\ <b><i>(\etechth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative from<br>
 \tikt&#333;\. Was born. <B>{Saviour}</B> <b><i>(\s&#333;t&#275;r\)</i></b>. This great word is common<br>
 in Luke and Paul and seldom elsewhere in the N.T. <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. The<br>
 people under Rome's rule came to call the emperor "Saviour" and<br>
 Christians took the word and used it of Christ. See inscriptions<br>
 <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient East_, p. 344)</i></b>. <B>{Christ the<br>
 Lord}</B> <b><i>(\Christos Kurios\)</i></b>. This combination occurs nowhere else<br>
 in the N.T. and it is not clear what it really means. Luke is<br>
 very fond of \Kurios\ <b><i>(<B>{Lord}</B>)</i></b> where the other Gospels have<br>
 Jesus. It may mean "Christ the Lord," "Anointed Lord," "Messiah,<br>
 Lord," "The Messiah, the Lord," "An Anointed One, a Lord," or<br>
 "Lord Messiah." It occurs once in the LXX <b><i>(<!-#-->La 4:20)</i></b> and is in<br>
 Ps. of Sol. 17:36. Ragg suggests that our phrase "the Lord Jesus<br>
 Christ" is really involved in "A Saviour <b><i>(Jesus)</i></b> which is Christ<br>
 the Lord." See on &#175;Mt 1:1 for Christ and &#175;Mt 21:3 for Lord.<br>
 <br>
 2:13 <B>{Host}</B> <b><i>(\stratias\)</i></b>. A military term for a band of soldiers<br>
 common in the ancient Greek. Bengel says: "Here the army<br>
 announces peace." <B>{Praising}</B> <b><i>(\ainount&#333;n\)</i></b>. Construction<br>
 according to sense <b><i>(plural, though \stratias\ is singular)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:14 <B>{Among men in whom he is well pleased}</B> <b><i>(\en anthr&#333;pois<br>
 eudokias\)</i></b>. The Textus Receptus <b><i>(Authorized Version also has<br>
 \eudokia\, but the genitive \eudokias\ is undoubtedly correct,<br>
 supported by the oldest and best uncials.)</i></b> <b><i>(Aleph, A B D W)</i></b>. C has<br>
 a lacuna here. Plummer justly notes how in this angelic hymn<br>
 Glory and Peace correspond, in the highest and on earth, to God<br>
 and among men of goodwill. It would be possible to connect "on<br>
 earth" with "the highest" and also to have a triple division.<br>
 There has been much objection raised to the genitive \eudokias\,<br>
 the correct text. But it makes perfectly good sense and better<br>
 sense. As a matter of fact real peace on earth exists only among<br>
 those who are the subjects of God's goodwill, who are<br>
 characterized by goodwill toward God and man. This word \eudokia\<br>
 we have already had in <!-#-->Mt 11:26. It does not occur in the<br>
 ancient Greek. The word is confined to Jewish and Christian<br>
 writings, though the papyri furnish instances of \eudok&#275;sis\.<br>
 Wycliff has it "to men of goodwill."<br>
 <br>
 2:15 <B>{Said to one another}</B> <b><i>(\elaloun pros all&#275;lous\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 tense, inchoative, "began to speak," each to the other. It<br>
 suggests also repetition, they kept saying, <B>{Now}</B> <b><i>(\d&#275;\)</i></b>. A<br>
 particle of urgency. <B>{This thing}</B> <b><i>(\to rh&#275;ma touto\)</i></b>. A<br>
 Hebraistic and vernacular use of \rh&#275;ma\ <b><i>(something said)</i></b> as<br>
 something done. See on &#175;Lu 1:65. The ancient Greek used \logos\<br>
 in this same way.<br>
 <br>
 2:16 <B>{With haste}</B> <b><i>(\speusantes\)</i></b>. Aorist active participle of<br>
 simultaneous action. <B>{Found}</B> <b><i>(\aneuran\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative of a common Greek verb \aneurisk&#333;\, but only in Luke<br>
 in the N.T. The compound \ana\ suggests a search before finding.<br>
 <br>
 2:17 <B>{Made known}</B> <b><i>(\egn&#333;risan\)</i></b>. To others <b><i>(verse <!-#-->18)</i></b> besides<br>
 Joseph and Mary. The verb is common from Aeschylus on, from the<br>
 root of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\ <b><i>(to know)</i></b>. It is both transitive and<br>
 intransitive in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 2:19 <B>{Kept}</B> <b><i>(\sunet&#275;rei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. She kept on keeping<br>
 together <b><i>(\sun-\)</i></b> all these things. They were meat and drink to<br>
 her. She was not astonished, but filled with holy awe. The verb<br>
 occurs from Aristotle on. She could not forget. But did not Mary<br>
 keep also a Baby Book? And may not Luke have seen it? <B>{Pondering}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sunballousa\)</i></b>. An old Greek word. Placing together for<br>
 comparison. Mary would go over each detail in the words of<br>
 Gabriel and of the shepherds and compare the sayings with the<br>
 facts so far developed and brood over it all with a mother's high<br>
 hopes and joy.<br>
 <br>
 2:21 <B>{His name was called Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\kai ekl&#275;th&#275; to onoma autou<br>
 I&#275;sous\)</i></b>. The \kai\ is left untranslated or has the sense of<br>
 "then" in the apodosis. The naming was a part of the ceremony of<br>
 circumcision as is shown also in the case of John the Baptist<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:59-66)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:22 <B>{The days of their purification}</B> <b><i>(\hai h&#275;merai tou<br>
 katharismou aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. The old manuscripts have "their" <b><i>(\aut&#333;n\)</i></b><br>
 instead of "her" <b><i>(\aut&#275;s\)</i></b> of the later documents. But it is not<br>
 clear whether "their" refers to Mary and Joseph as is true of<br>
 "they brought" or to Mary and the child. The mother was<br>
 Levitically unclean for forty days after the birth of a son <b><i>(<!-#-->Le<br>
 12:1-8)</i></b>. <B>{To present him to the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\parast&#275;sai t&#333;i Kuri&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Every first-born son was thus redeemed by the sacrifice <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex<br>
 13:2-12)</i></b> as a memorial of the sparing of the Israelitish<br>
 families <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 18:15f.)</i></b>. The cost was about two dollars and a<br>
 half in our money.<br>
 <br>
 2:23 <B>{In the law of the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\en nom&#333;i Kuriou\)</i></b>. No articles,<br>
 but definite by preposition and genitive. Vincent notes that<br>
 "law" occurs in this chapter five times. Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->Gal 4:4)</i></b> will<br>
 urge that Jesus "was made under the law" as Luke here explains.<br>
 The law did not require that the child be brought to Jerusalem.<br>
 The purification concerned the mother, the presentation the son.<br>
 <br>
 2:24 <B>{A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons}</B> <b><i>(\Zeugos<br>
 trugon&#333;n &#275; duo nossous perister&#333;n\)</i></b>. The offspring of the poor,<br>
 costing about sixteen cents, while a lamb would cost nearly two<br>
 dollars. The "young of pigeons" is the literal meaning.<br>
 <br>
 2:25 <B>{Devout}</B> <b><i>(\eulab&#275;s\)</i></b>. Used only by Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 2:5; 8:2;<br>
 22:12)</i></b> in the N.T. Common in ancient Greek from Plato on. It<br>
 means taking hold well or carefully <b><i>(\eu\ and \labein\)</i></b> and so<br>
 reverently, circumspectly. <B>{Looking for the consolation of<br>
 Israel}</B> <b><i>(\prosdechomenos parakl&#275;sin tou Israel\)</i></b>. Old Greek verb<br>
 to admit to one's presence <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 15:2)</i></b> and then to expect as here<br>
 and of Anna in verse <!-#-->38. <B>{Parakl&#275;sin}</B> here means the Messianic<br>
 hope <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 11:10; 40:1)</i></b>, calling to one's side for cheer. <B>{Upon<br>
 him}</B> <b><i>(\ep' auton\)</i></b>. This is the explanation of his lively<br>
 Messianic hope. It was due to the Holy Spirit. Simeon and Anna<br>
 are representatives of real piety in this time of spiritual<br>
 dearth and deadness.<br>
 <br>
 2:26 <B>{It had been revealed unto him}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n aut&#333;i<br>
 kechr&#275;matismenon\)</i></b>. Periphrastic past perfect passive indicative.<br>
 Common Greek verb. First to transact business from \chr&#275;ma\ and<br>
 that from \chraomai\, to use, make use of; then to do business<br>
 with public officials, to give advice <b><i>(judges, rulers, kings)</i></b>,<br>
 then to get the advice of the Delphic and other oracles<br>
 <b><i>(Diodorus, Plutarch)</i></b>. The LXX and Josephus use it of God's<br>
 commands. A Fayum papyrus of 257 B.C. has the substantive<br>
 \chr&#275;mastismos\ for a divine response <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ro 11:4)</i></b>. See<br>
 Deissmann, _Light From the Ancient East_, p. 153. <B>{Before}</B> <b><i>(\prin<br>
 &#275;\)</i></b>. Classic Greek idiom after a negative to have subjunctive as<br>
 here <b><i>(only example in the N.T.)</i></b> or the optative after past tense<br>
 as in <!-#-->Ac 25:16 <b><i>(subjunctive changed to optative in indirect<br>
 discourse)</i></b>. Elsewhere in the N.T. the infinitive follows \prin\<br>
 as in <!-#-->Mt 1:18.<br>
 <br>
 2:27 <B>{When the parents brought in the child Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i<br>
 eisagagein tous goneis to paidion I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. A neat Greek and<br>
 Hebrew idiom difficult to render into English, very common in the<br>
 LXX; <B>{In the bringing the Child Jesus as to the parents}</B>. The<br>
 articular infinitive and two accusatives <b><i>(one the object, the<br>
 other accusative of general reference)</i></b>. <B>{After the custom of the<br>
 law}</B> <b><i>(\kata to eithismenon tou nomou\)</i></b>. Here the perfect passive<br>
 participle \eithismenon\, neuter singular from \ethiz&#333;\ <b><i>(common<br>
 Greek verb, to accustom)</i></b> is used as a virtual substantive like<br>
 \to ethos\ in <!-#-->1:8. Luke alone in the N.T. uses either word save<br>
 \ethos\ in <!-#-->Joh 19:40, though \ei&#333;tha\ from \eth&#333;\, occurs also<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 27:15; Mr 10:1.<br>
 <br>
 2:28 <B>{Then he}</B> <b><i>(\kai autos\)</i></b>. \Kai\ as in <!-#-->2:21. \Autos\,<br>
 emphatic subject, he after the parents. <B>{Arms}</B> <b><i>(\agkalas\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 Greek word, here only in the N.T. It means the curve or inner<br>
 angle of the arm.<br>
 <br>
 2:29 <B>{Now lettest thou}</B> <b><i>(\nun apolueis\)</i></b>. Present active<br>
 indicative, <B>{Thou art letting}</B>. The _Nunc Dimittis_, adoration<br>
 and praise. It is full of rapture and vivid intensity <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b><br>
 like the best of the Psalms. The verb \apolu&#333;\ was common for the<br>
 manumission of slaves and Simeon here calls himself "thy slave<br>
 <b><i>(\doulon sou\)</i></b>, Lord <b><i>(\Despota\, our despot)</i></b>." See <!-#-->2Pe 2:1.<br>
 <br>
 2:31 <B>{Of all the peoples}</B> <b><i>(\pant&#333;n t&#333;n la&#333;n\)</i></b>. Not merely Jews.<br>
 Another illustration of the universality of Luke's Gospel seen<br>
 already in <!-#-->1:70 in the hymn of Zacharias. The second strophe of<br>
 the song according to Plummer showing what the Messiah will be to<br>
 the world after having shown what the Messiah is to Simeon.<br>
 <br>
 2:32 <B>{Revelation to the Gentiles}</B> <b><i>(\apokalupsin ethn&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Objective genitive. The Messiah is to be light <b><i>(\ph&#333;s\)</i></b> for the<br>
 Gentiles in darkness <b><i>(<!-#-->1:70)</i></b> and glory <b><i>(\doxa\)</i></b> for Israel <b><i>(cf.<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 9:1-5; Isa 49:6)</i></b>. The word \ethnos\ originally meant just a<br>
 crowd or company, then a race or nation, then the nations other<br>
 than Israel <b><i>(the people, \ho laos\)</i></b> or the people of God. The<br>
 word Gentile is Latin from _gens_, a tribe or nation. But the<br>
 world-wide mission of the Messiah comes out clearly in these<br>
 early chapters in Luke.<br>
 <br>
 2:33 <B>{His father and his mother}</B> <b><i>(\ho pat&#275;r autou kai h&#275; m&#275;t&#275;r\)</i></b>.<br>
 Luke had already used "parents" in <!-#-->2:27. He by no means intends<br>
 to deny the Virgin Birth of Jesus so plainly stated in <!-#-->1:34-38.<br>
 He merely employs here the language of ordinary custom. The late<br>
 MSS. wrongly read "and Joseph" instead of "his father." <B>{Were<br>
 marvelling}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n thaumazontes\)</i></b>. The masculine gender includes<br>
 the feminine when both are referred to. But \&#275;n\ is singular, not<br>
 \&#275;san\, the normal imperfect plural in this periphrastic<br>
 imperfect. This is due to the wide space between copula and<br>
 participle. The copula \&#275;n\ agrees in number with \ho pat&#275;r\<br>
 while the participle coming last agrees with both \ho pater kai<br>
 h&#275; m&#275;t&#275;r\ <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mt 17:3; 22:40)</i></b>. If one wonders why they<br>
 marvelled at Simeon's words after what they had heard from<br>
 Gabriel, Elisabeth, and the Shepherds, he should bear in mind<br>
 that every parent is astonished and pleased at the fine things<br>
 others see in the child. It is a mark of unusual insight for<br>
 others to see so much that is obvious to the parent. Simeon's<br>
 prophecy had gone beyond the angel's outline and it was<br>
 surprising that he should know anything about the child's<br>
 destiny.<br>
 <br>
 2:34 <B>{Is set for the falling and the rising up of many in Israel}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Keitai eis pt&#333;sin kai anastasin poll&#333;n en t&#333;i Isra&#275;l\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 indicative of the old defective verb appearing only in present<br>
 and imperfect in the N.T. Sometimes it is used as the passive of<br>
 \tith&#275;mi\ as here. The falling of some and the rising up of<br>
 others is what is meant. He will be a stumbling-block to some<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 8:14; Mt 21:42,44; Ro 9:33; 1Pe 2:16f.)</i></b> who love darkness<br>
 rather than light <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 3:19)</i></b>, he will be the cause of rising<br>
 for others <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 6:4,9; Eph 2:6)</i></b>. "Judas despairs, Peter repents:<br>
 one robber blasphemes, the other confesses" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. Jesus is<br>
 the magnet of the ages. He draws some, he repels others. This is<br>
 true of all epoch-making men to some extent. <B>{Spoken against}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\antilegomenon\)</i></b>. Present passive participle, continuous action.<br>
 It is going on today. Nietzsche regarded Jesus Christ as the<br>
 curse of the race because he spared the weak.<br>
 <br>
 2:35 <B>{A sword}</B> <b><i>(\rhomphaia\)</i></b>. A large sword, properly a long<br>
 Thracian javelin. It occurs in the LXX of Goliath's sword <b><i>(<!-#-->1Sa<br>
 17:51)</i></b>. How little Mary understood the meaning of Simeon's words<br>
 that seemed so out of place in the midst of the glorious things<br>
 already spoken, a sharp thorn in their roses, a veritable<br>
 bitter-sweet. But one day Mary will stand by the Cross of Christ<br>
 with this Thracian javelin clean through her soul, \stabat Mater<br>
 Dolorosa\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:25)</i></b>. It is only a parenthesis here, and a<br>
 passing cloud perhaps passed over Mary's heart already puzzled<br>
 with rapture and ecstasy. <B>{May be revealed}</B> <b><i>(\apokaluphth&#333;sin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Unveiled. First aorist passive subjunctive after \hop&#333;s an\ and<br>
 expresses God's purpose in the mission of the Messiah. He is to<br>
 test men's thoughts <b><i>(\dialogismoi\)</i></b> and purposes. They will be<br>
 compelled to take a stand for Christ or against him. That is true<br>
 today.<br>
 <br>
 2:36 <B>{One Anna a prophetess}</B> <b><i>(\Hanna proph&#275;tis\)</i></b>. The word<br>
 \proph&#275;tis\ occurs in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Re 2:20. In old<br>
 Greek writers it means a woman who interprets oracles. The long<br>
 parenthesis into verse <!-#-->37 tells of her great age. Montefiore<br>
 makes it 106 as she was 15 when married, married 7 years, a widow<br>
 84.<br>
 <br>
 2:37 <B>{Which departed not}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; ouk aphistato\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 indicative middle. She kept on not leaving. The Spirit kept her<br>
 in the temple as he led Simon to the temple <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. The case<br>
 of "the temple" <b><i>(\tou hierou\)</i></b> is ablative. <B>{Night and day}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\nukta kai h&#275;meran\)</i></b>. Accusative of duration of time, all night<br>
 and all day. She never missed a service in the temple.<br>
 <br>
 2:38 <B>{Coming up}</B> <b><i>(\epist&#257;sa\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle.<br>
 The word often has the notion of coming suddenly or bursting in<br>
 as of Martha in <!-#-->Lu 10:40. But here it probably means coming up<br>
 and standing by and so hearing Simeon's wonderful words so that<br>
 her words form a kind of footnote to his. <B>{Gave thanks}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anth&#333;mologeito\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of a verb <b><i>(\anthomologe&#333;\)</i></b><br>
 in common use in Greek writers and in the LXX though here alone<br>
 in the N.T. It had the idea of a mutual agreement or of saying<br>
 something before one <b><i>(\anti\)</i></b>. Anna was evidently deeply moved<br>
 and repeated her thanksgiving and kept speaking <b><i>(\elalei\,<br>
 imperfect again)</i></b> "to all them that were looking for<br>
 <b><i>(\prosdechomenois\, as in <!-#-->1:35 of Simeon)</i></b> the redemption of<br>
 Jerusalem <b><i>(\lutr&#333;sin Ierousal&#275;m\)</i></b>." There was evidently a group<br>
 of such spirits that gathered in the temple either men around her<br>
 and Simeon or whom she met from time to time. There was thus a<br>
 nucleus of old saints in Jerusalem prepared for the coming of the<br>
 Messiah when he at last appears as the Messiah in Jerusalem <b><i>(John<br>
 2 and 3)</i></b>. These probably all passed away. But they had a happy<br>
 hour of hope and joy. The late MSS. have "in Jerusalem" but "of<br>
 Jerusalem" is correct. What they meant by the "redemption of<br>
 Jerusalem" is not clear, whether political or spiritual or both.<br>
 Simeon was looking for the consolation of Israel <b><i>(<!-#-->2:25)</i></b> and<br>
 Zacharias <b><i>(<!-#-->1:68)</i></b> sang of redemption for Israel <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 40:2)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:39 <B>{To their own city Nazareth}</B> <b><i>(\eis polin heaut&#333;n Nazaret\)</i></b>.<br>
 See on <!-#-->Mt 2:23 about Nazareth. Luke tells nothing of the flight<br>
 to Egypt and the reason for the return to Nazareth instead of<br>
 Bethlehem, the place of the birth of Jesus as told in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 2:13-23. But then neither Gospel gives all the details of this<br>
 period. Luke has also nothing about the visit of the wise men<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 2:1-12)</i></b> as Matthew tells nothing of the shepherds and of<br>
 Simeon and Anna <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:8-28)</i></b>. The two Gospels supplement each<br>
 other.<br>
 <br>
 2:40 <B>{The child grew}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;uxane\)</i></b>. Imperfect indicative of a very<br>
 ancient verb <b><i>(\auxan&#333;\)</i></b>. This child grew and waxed strong<br>
 <b><i>(\ekrataiouto\, imperfect middle)</i></b>, a hearty vigorous little boy<br>
 <b><i>(\paidion\)</i></b>. Both verbs Luke used in <!-#-->1:80 of the growth of John<br>
 the Baptist as a child. Then he used also \pneumati\, in spirit.<br>
 Here in addition to the bodily development Luke has "filled with<br>
 wisdom" <b><i>(\pl&#275;roumenon sophi&#257;i\)</i></b>. Present passive participle,<br>
 showing that the process of filling with wisdom kept pace with<br>
 the bodily growth. If it were only always true with others! We<br>
 need not be troubled over this growth in wisdom on the part of<br>
 Jesus any more than over his bodily growth. "The intellectual,<br>
 moral, and spiritual growth of the Child, like the physical, was<br>
 real. His was a perfect humanity developing perfectly, unimpeded<br>
 by hereditary or acquired defects. It was the first instance of<br>
 such a growth in history. For the first time a human infant was<br>
 realizing the ideal of humanity" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{The grace of God}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\charis theou\)</i></b>. In full measure.<br>
 <br>
 2:41 <B>{Every year}</B> <b><i>(\kat' etos\)</i></b>. This idiom only here in the<br>
 N.T., a common Greek construction. Every male was originally<br>
 expected to appear at the passover, pentecost, and tabernacles<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 23:14-17; 34:23; De 16:16)</i></b>. But the Dispersion rendered<br>
 that impossible. But pious Palestinian Jews made a point of going<br>
 at least to the passover. Mary went with Joseph as a pious habit,<br>
 though not required by law to go.<br>
 <br>
 2:42 <B>{Twelve years old}</B> <b><i>(\et&#333;n d&#333;deka\)</i></b>. Predicate genitive. Luke<br>
 does not say that Jesus had not been to Jerusalem before, but at<br>
 twelve a Jewish boy became a "son of the law" and began to<br>
 observe the ordinances, putting on the phylacteries as a<br>
 reminder. <B>{They went up}</B> <b><i>(\anabainont&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute with present active participle, a loose construction<br>
 here, for the incident narrated took place _after_ they had gone<br>
 up, not _while_ they were gong up. "On their usual going up"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:43 <B>{When they had fulfilled the days}</B> <b><i>(\telei&#333;sant&#333;n tas<br>
 h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again, but aorist participle<br>
 <b><i>(effective aorist)</i></b>. "The days" may mean the full seven days <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex<br>
 12:15f.; Le 23:6-8; De 16:3)</i></b>, or the two chief days after which<br>
 many pilgrims left for home. <B>{As they were returning}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i<br>
 hupostrephein antous\)</i></b>. The articular infinitive with \en\, a<br>
 construction that Luke often uses <b><i>(<!-#-->1:21; 2:27)</i></b>. <B>{The boy,<br>
 Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\I&#275;sous ho pais\)</i></b>. More exactly, "Jesus the boy." In<br>
 verse <!-#-->40 it was "the child " <b><i>(\to paidion\)</i></b>, here it is "the<br>
 boy" <b><i>(\ho pais\, no longer the diminutive form)</i></b>. It was not<br>
 disobedience on the part of "the boy" that made him remain<br>
 behind, but intense interest in the services of the temple;<br>
 "involuntary preoccupation" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b> held him fast.<br>
 <br>
 2:44 <B>{In the company}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i sunodi&#257;i\)</i></b>. The caravan going<br>
 together on the road or way <b><i>(\sun, hodos\)</i></b>, a journey in company,<br>
 then by metonymy the company itself. A common Greek word<br>
 <b><i>(Plutarch, Strabo, etc.)</i></b>. The women usually went ahead and the<br>
 men followed. Joseph may have thought Jesus was with Mary and<br>
 Mary that he was with Joseph. "The Nazareth caravan was so long<br>
 that it took a whole day to look through it" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{They<br>
 sought for him}</B> <b><i>(\anez&#275;toun auton\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. Common<br>
 Greek verb. Note force of \ana\. They searched up and down, back<br>
 and forth, a thorough search and prolonged, but in vain.<br>
 <br>
 2:45 <B>{Seeking for him}</B> <b><i>(\anaz&#275;tountes auton\)</i></b>. Present participle<br>
 of the same verb. This was all that was worth while now, finding<br>
 the lost boy.<br>
 <br>
 2:46 <B>{After three days}</B> <b><i>(\meta h&#275;meras treis\)</i></b>. One day out, one<br>
 day back, and on the third day finding him. <B>{In the temple}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 t&#333;i hier&#333;i\)</i></b>. Probably on the terrace where members of the<br>
 Sanhedrin gave public instruction on sabbaths and feast-days, so<br>
 probably while the feast was still going on. The rabbis probably<br>
 sat on benches in a circle. The listeners on the ground, among<br>
 whom was Jesus the boy in a rapture of interest. <B>{Both hearing<br>
 them and asking them questions}</B> <b><i>(\kai akouonta aut&#333;n kai<br>
 eper&#333;t&#333;nta autous\)</i></b>. Paul sat at the feet of Gamaliel <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 22:3)</i></b>. Picture this eager boy alive with interest. It was his<br>
 one opportunity in a theological school outside of the synagogue<br>
 to hear the great rabbis expound the problems of life. This was<br>
 the most unusual of all children, to be sure, in intellectual<br>
 grasp and power. But it is a mistake to think that children of<br>
 twelve do not think profoundly concerning the issues of life.<br>
 What father or mother has ever been able to answer a child's<br>
 questions?<br>
 <br>
 2:47 <B>{Were amazed}</B> <b><i>(\existanto\)</i></b>. Imperfect indicative middle,<br>
 descriptive of their continued and repeated astonishment. Common<br>
 verb \exist&#275;mi\ meaning that they stood out of themselves as if<br>
 their eyes were bulging out. The boy had a holy thirst for<br>
 knowledge <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>, and he used a boy's way of learning. <B>{At his<br>
 understanding}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;i sunesei\)</i></b>. Based on <b><i>(\epi\)</i></b>, the grasp<br>
 and comprehension from \suni&#275;mi\, comparing and combining things.<br>
 Cf. <!-#-->Mr 12:33. <B>{His answers}</B> <b><i>(\tais apokrisesin autou\)</i></b>. It is<br>
 not difficult to ask hard questions, but this boy had astounding<br>
 answers to their questions, revealing his amazing intellectual<br>
 and spiritual growth.<br>
 <br>
 2:48 <B>{They were astonished}</B> <b><i>(\exeplag&#275;san\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 passive indicative of an old Greek word <b><i>(\ekpl&#275;ss&#333;\)</i></b>, to strike<br>
 out, drive out by a blow. Joseph and Mary "were struck out" by<br>
 what they saw and heard. Even they had not fully realized the<br>
 power in this wonderful boy. Parents often fail to perceive the<br>
 wealth of nature in their children.<br>
 <br>
 2:49 <B>{Son}</B> <b><i>(\teknon\)</i></b>. Child, literally. It was natural for Mary<br>
 to be the first to speak. <B>{Why}</B> <b><i>(\Ti\)</i></b>. The mother's reproach of<br>
 the boy is followed by a confession of negligence on her part and<br>
 of Joseph <b><i>(<B>{sorrowing}</B>, \odun&#333;menoi\)</i></b>. <B>{Thy father}</B> <b><i>(\ho pater<br>
 sou\)</i></b>. No contradiction in this. Alford says: "Up to this time<br>
 Joseph had been so called by the holy child himself, but from<br>
 this time never." <B>{Sought}</B> <b><i>(\ez&#275;toumen\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense<br>
 describing the long drawn out search for three days. <B>{How is it<br>
 that}</B> <b><i>(\Ti hoti\)</i></b>. The first words of Jesus preserved to us. This<br>
 crisp Greek idiom without copula expresses the boy's amazement<br>
 that his parents should not know that there was only one possible<br>
 place in Jerusalem for him. <B>{I must be}</B> <b><i>(\dei einai me\)</i></b>.<br>
 Messianic consciousness of the necessity laid on him. Jesus often<br>
 uses \dei\ <b><i>(must)</i></b> about his work. Of all the golden dreams of any<br>
 boy of twelve here is the greatest. <B>{In my Father's house}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 tois tou patros mou\)</i></b>. Not "about my Father's business," but "in<br>
 my Father's house" <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ge 41:51)</i></b>. Common Greek idiom. And note<br>
 "my," not "our." When the boy first became conscious of his<br>
 peculiar relation to the Father in heaven we do not know. But he<br>
 has it now at twelve and it will grow within him through the<br>
 years ahead in Nazareth.<br>
 <br>
 2:50 <B>{They understood not}</B> <b><i>(\ou sun&#275;kan\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative <b><i>(one of the k aorists)</i></b>. Even Mary with all her<br>
 previous preparation and brooding was not equal to the dawning of<br>
 the Messianic consciousness in her boy. "My Father is God," Jesus<br>
 had virtually said, "and I must be in His house." Bruce observes<br>
 that a new era has come when Jesus calls God "Father," not<br>
 \Despotes\. "Even we do not yet fully understand" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b> what<br>
 Jesus the boy here said.<br>
 <br>
 2:51 <B>{He was subject unto them}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n hupotassomenos autois\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic imperfect passive. He continued subject unto them,<br>
 this wondrous boy who really knew more than parents and rabbis,<br>
 this gentle, obedient, affectionate boy. The next eighteen years<br>
 at Nazareth <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 3:23)</i></b> he remained growing into manhood and<br>
 becoming the carpenter of Nazareth <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 6:3)</i></b> in succession to<br>
 Joseph <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 13:55)</i></b> who is mentioned here for the last time. Who<br>
 can tell the wistful days when Jesus waited at Nazareth for the<br>
 Father to call him to his Messianic task? <B>{Kept}</B> <b><i>(\diet&#275;rei\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active. Ancient Greek word <b><i>(\diat&#275;re&#333;\)</i></b>, but only here<br>
 and <!-#-->Ac 15:29 in the N.T. though in <!-#-->Ge 37:11. She kept<br>
 thoroughly <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> all these recent sayings <b><i>(or things,<br>
 \rh&#275;mata\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->2:19 \sunet&#275;rei\ is the word used of Mary after<br>
 the shepherds left. These she kept pondering and comparing all<br>
 the things. Surely she has a full heart now. Could she foresee<br>
 how destiny would take Jesus out beyond her mother's reach?<br>
 <br>
 2:52 <B>{Advanced in wisdom and stature}</B> <b><i>(\proekopten t&#275;i sophi&#257;i<br>
 kai h&#275;liki&#257;i\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, he kept cutting his way forward<br>
 as through a forest or jungle as pioneers did. He kept growing in<br>
 stature <b><i>(\h&#275;likia\ may mean age, as in <!-#-->12:25, but stature here)</i></b><br>
 and in wisdom <b><i>(more than mere knowledge)</i></b>. His physical,<br>
 intellectual, moral, spiritual development was perfect. "At each<br>
 stage he was perfect for that stage" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{In favour}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\chariti\)</i></b>. Or grace. This is ideal manhood to have the favour<br>
 of God and men.<br>
