<p>1:1 <B>{And Timothy}</B> <b><i>(\kai Timotheos\)</i></b>. Timothy is with Paul, having<br>
 been sent on to Macedonia from Ephesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 19:22)</i></b>. He is in no<br>
 sense co-author any more than Sosthenes was in <!-#-->1Co 1:1. <B>{In all<br>
 Achaia}</B> <b><i>(\en hol&#275;i t&#275;i Achai&#257;i\)</i></b>. The Romans divided Greece into<br>
 two provinces <b><i>(Achaia and Macedonia)</i></b>. Macedonia included also<br>
 Illyricum, Epirus, and Thessaly. Achaia was all of Greece south<br>
 of this <b><i>(both Attica and the Peloponnesus)</i></b>. The restored Corinth<br>
 was made the capital of Achaia where the pro-consul resided <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 18:12)</i></b>. He does not mention other churches in Achaia outside of<br>
 the one in Corinth, but only "saints" <b><i>(\hagiois\)</i></b>. Athens was in<br>
 Achaia, but it is not clear that there was as yet a church there,<br>
 though some converts had been won <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 17:34)</i></b>, and there was a<br>
 church in Cenchreae, the eastern port of Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 16:1)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul in <!-#-->2Co 9:2 speaks of Achaia and Macedonia together. His<br>
 language here would seem to cover the whole <b><i>(\hol&#275;i\, all)</i></b> of<br>
 Achaia in his scope and not merely the environment around<br>
 Corinth.<br>
 <br>
 1:2 Identical with <!-#-->1Co 1:3 which see.<br>
 <br>
 1:3 <B>{Blessed}</B> <b><i>(\eulog&#275;tos\)</i></b>. From old verb \euloge&#333;\, to speak<br>
 well of, but late verbal in LXX and Philo. Used of men in <!-#-->Ge<br>
 24:31, but only of God in N.T. as in <!-#-->Lu 1:68 and chiefly in<br>
 Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:31; Ro 1:25)</i></b>. Paul has no thanksgiving or prayer<br>
 as in <!-#-->1Co 1:4-9, but he finds his basis for gratitude in God,<br>
 not in them. <B>{The God and Father}</B> <b><i>(\ho theos kai pat&#275;r\)</i></b>. So<br>
 rightly, only one article with both substantives as in <!-#-->2Pe 1:1.<br>
 Paul gives the deity of Jesus Christ as our Lord <b><i>(\Kuriou\)</i></b>, but<br>
 he does not hesitate to use the language here as it occurs. See<br>
 <!-#-->1Pe 1:3; Eph 1:3 where the language is identical with that<br>
 here. <B>{The father of mercies}</B> <b><i>(\ho pat&#275;r t&#333;n oiktirm&#333;n\)</i></b> and God<br>
 of all comfort <b><i>(\kai theos pas&#275;s parakl&#275;se&#333;s\)</i></b>. Paul adds an item<br>
 to each word. He is the compassionate Father characterized by<br>
 mercies <b><i>(\oiktirm&#333;n\, old word from \oikteir&#333;\, to pity, and here<br>
 in plural, emotions and acts of pity)</i></b>. He is the God of all<br>
 comfort <b><i>(\parakl&#275;se&#333;s\, old word from \parakale&#333;\, to call to<br>
 one's side, common with Paul)</i></b>. Paul has already used it of God<br>
 who gave eternal comfort <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 2:16)</i></b>. The English word comfort<br>
 is from the Latin _confortis_ <b><i>(brave together)</i></b>. The word used by<br>
 Jesus of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter or Paraklete is this<br>
 very word <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 14:16; 16:7)</i></b>. Paul makes rich use of the verb<br>
 \parakale&#333;\ and the substantive \parakl&#275;sis\ in this passage<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->3-7)</i></b>. He urges all sorrowing and troubled hearts to find<br>
 strength in God.<br>
 <br>
 1:4 <B>{In all our affliction}</B> <b><i>(\epi pas&#275;i t&#275;i thlipsei h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 \Thlipsis\ is from \thlib&#333;\, to press, old and common word, as<br>
 tribulation is from Latin _tribulum_ <b><i>(roller)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 13:21<br>
 and <!-#-->1Th 1:6. The English affliction is Latin _afflictio_ from<br>
 _ad-fligere_, to strike on. <B>{That we may be able to comfort}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eis to dunasthai h&#275;mas parakalein\)</i></b>. Purpose clause with \eis\<br>
 and the articular infinitive with the accusative of general<br>
 reference, a common idiom. Paul here gives the purpose of<br>
 affliction in the preacher's life, in any Christian's life, to<br>
 qualify him for ministry to others. Otherwise it will be<br>
 professional and perfunctory. <B>{Wherewith}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;s\)</i></b>. Genitive case<br>
 of the relative attracted to that of the antecedent<br>
 \parakl&#275;se&#333;s\. The case of the relative here could have been<br>
 either the accusative \h&#275;n\ with the passive verb retained as in<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 10:38 or the instrumental \h&#275;i\. Either is perfectly good<br>
 Greek <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Eph 1:6; 4:1)</i></b>. Personal experience of God's comfort<br>
 is necessary before we can pass it on to others.<br>
 <br>
 1:5 <B>{The sufferings of Christ}</B> <b><i>(\ta path&#275;mata tou Christou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Subjective genitive, Christ's own sufferings. <B>{Abound unto us}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\perisseuei eis h&#275;mas\)</i></b>. Overflow unto us so that we suffer like<br>
 sufferings and become fellow sufferers with Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->4:10f.; Ro<br>
 8:17; Php 3:10; Col 1:24)</i></b>. <B>{Through Christ}</B> <b><i>(\dia tou<br>
 Christou\)</i></b>. The overflow <b><i>(\perisseuei\)</i></b> of comfort comes also<br>
 through Christ. Is Paul thinking of how some of the Jewish<br>
 Christians in Corinth have become reconciled with him through<br>
 Christ? Partnership with Christ in suffering brings partnership<br>
 in glory also <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 8:17; 1Pe 4:13)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:6 <B>{Whether}</B> <b><i>(\eite\)</i></b> <B>{--or}</B> <b><i>(\eite\)</i></b>. The alternatives in<br>
 Paul's experience <b><i>(afflicted \thlibometha\, comforted<br>
 \parakaloumetha\)</i></b> work out for their good when they are called on<br>
 to endure like sufferings "which we also suffer" <b><i>(\h&#333;n kai h&#275;meis<br>
 paschomen\)</i></b>. The relative \h&#333;n\ is attracted from neuter<br>
 accusative plural \ha\ to genitive case of the antecedent<br>
 \path&#275;mat&#333;n\ <b><i>(sufferings)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:7 <B>{Our hope for you}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; elpis h&#275;m&#333;n huper hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. The old<br>
 word \elpis\, from \elpiz&#333;\, to hope, has the idea of waiting<br>
 with expectation and patience. So here it is "steadfast"<br>
 <b><i>(\bebaia\, stable, fast, from \bain&#333;\, to plant the feet down)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Partakers}</B> <b><i>(\koin&#333;noi\)</i></b>. Partners as in <!-#-->Lu 5:10.<br>
 <br>
 1:8 <B>{Concerning our affliction}</B> <b><i>(\huper t&#275;s thlipse&#333;s h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Manuscripts read also \peri\ for in the _Koin&#275;_ \huper\ <b><i>(over)</i></b><br>
 often has the idea of \peri\ <b><i>(around)</i></b>. Paul has laid down his<br>
 philosophy of afflictions and now he cites a specific<br>
 illustration in his own recent experience. <B>{In Asia}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 Asi&#257;i\)</i></b>. Probably in Ephesus, but what it was we do not know<br>
 whether sickness or peril. We do know that the disciples and the<br>
 Asiarchs would not allow Paul to face the mob in the amphitheatre<br>
 gathered by Demetrius <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:30f.)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Ro 16:4 Paul says that<br>
 Prisca and Aquila laid down their necks for him, risked their<br>
 very lives for him. It may have been a later plot to kill Paul<br>
 that hastened his departure from Ephesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:1)</i></b>. He had a<br>
 trial so great that "we were weighed down exceedingly beyond our<br>
 power" <b><i>(\kath' huperbol&#275;n huper dunamin ebar&#275;th&#275;men\)</i></b>. Old verb<br>
 from \baros\, weight, \barus\, weighty. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative. See on &#175;1Co 12:31 for \kath' huperbol&#275;n\ <b><i>(cf. our<br>
 hyperbole)</i></b>. It was beyond Paul's power to endure if left to<br>
 himself. <B>{Insomuch that we despaired even of life}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste<br>
 exapor&#275;th&#275;nai h&#275;mas kai tou z&#275;in\)</i></b>. Usual clause of result with<br>
 \h&#333;ste\ and the infinitive. First aorist passive infinitive<br>
 \exapor&#275;th&#275;nai\, late compound for utter despair <b><i>(perfective use<br>
 of \ex\ and at a complete loss, \a\ privative and \poros\, way)</i></b>.<br>
 There seemed no way out. <B>{Of life}</B> <b><i>(\tou z&#275;in\)</i></b>. Ablative case of<br>
 the articular infinitive, of living.<br>
 <br>
 1:9 <B>{Yea}</B> <b><i>(\alla\)</i></b>. Confirmatory use as in <!-#-->7:11, rather than<br>
 adversative. <B>{The answer of death}</B> <b><i>(\to apokrima tou thanatou\)</i></b><br>
 This late word from \apokrinomai\, to reply, occurs nowhere else<br>
 in N.T., but is in Josephus, Polybius, inscriptions and papyri<br>
 <b><i>(Deissmann, _Bible Studies_, p. 257; Moulton and Milligan's<br>
 _Vocabulary_)</i></b>, and always in the sense of decision or judgment<br>
 rendered. But Vulgate renders it by _responsum_ and that idea<br>
 suits best here, unless Paul conceives God as rendering the<br>
 decision of death. <B>{We ourselves have had within ourselves}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\autoi en heautois esch&#275;kamen\)</i></b>. Regular perfect of \ech&#333;\, to<br>
 have. And still have the vivid recollection of that experience.<br>
 For this lively dramatic use of the present perfect indicative<br>
 for a past experience see also \esch&#275;ka\ in <!-#-->2:13 <b><i>(Moulton,<br>
 _Prolegomena_, p. 143f.; Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 896f.)</i></b>. <B>{That<br>
 we should not trust in ourselves}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275; pepoithotes &#333;men eph'<br>
 heautois\)</i></b>. A further purpose of God in affliction beyond that in<br>
 verse <!-#-->4. "This dreadful trial was sent to him in order to give<br>
 him a precious spiritual lesson <b><i>(<!-#-->12:7-10)</i></b>" <b><i>(Robertson and<br>
 Plummer)</i></b>. Note periphrastic perfect active subjunctive of<br>
 \peith&#333;\, to persuade. <B>{In}</B> <b><i>(\epi\)</i></b>, upon, both ourselves and<br>
 God.<br>
 <br>
 1:10 <B>{Out of so great a death}</B> <b><i>(\ek t&#275;likoutou thanatou\)</i></b>. He had<br>
 considered himself as good as dead. <B>{Delivered}</B> <b><i>(\erusato\)</i></b><br>
 <B>{--will deliver}</B> <b><i>(\rusetai\)</i></b>. Old verb \ru&#333;\, middle, \ruomai\,<br>
 draw oneself, as out of a pit, rescue. So Paul faces death<br>
 without fear. <B>{On whom we have set our hope}</B> <b><i>(\eis hon<br>
 &#275;lpikamen\)</i></b>. Perfect active indicative of \elpiz&#333;\. We still have<br>
 that hope, emphasized by \eti rusetai\ <b><i>(he will still deliver)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:11 <B>{Ye also helping together on our behalf}</B> <b><i>(\sunupourgount&#333;n<br>
 kai hum&#333;n huper h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute with present active<br>
 participle of late compound verb <b><i>(\sun\ and \hupourge&#333;\ for<br>
 \hupo\ and \ergon\)</i></b>. Paul relied on God and felt the need of the<br>
 prayer of God's people. <B>{By means of many}</B> <b><i>(\ek poll&#333;n<br>
 pros&#333;p&#333;n\)</i></b>. \Pros&#333;pon\ means face <b><i>(\pros, ops\)</i></b>. The word is<br>
 common in all Greek. The papyri use it for face, appearance,<br>
 person. It occurs twelve times in II Corinthians. It certainly<br>
 means face in eight of them <b><i>(<!-#-->3:7,13,18; 8:24; 10:1,7; 11:20)</i></b>.<br>
 In <!-#-->5:12 it means outward appearance. It may mean face or person<br>
 here, <!-#-->2:10; 4:6. It is more pictorial to take it here as face<br>
 "that out of many upturned faces" thanks may be given<br>
 <b><i>(\hina--eucharist&#275;th&#275;i\ first aorist passive subjunctive)</i></b> for the<br>
 gift to us by means of many <b><i>(\dia pollon\)</i></b>. It is indeed a<br>
 difficult sentence to understand.<br>
 <br>
 1:12 <B>{Glorying}</B> <b><i>(\kauch&#275;sis\)</i></b>. Act of glorying, while in verse<br>
 <!-#-->14 \kauch&#275;ma\ is the thing boasted of. <B>{The testimony of our<br>
 conscience}</B> <b><i>(\to marturion t&#275;s suneid&#275;se&#333;s h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. In apposition<br>
 with \kauch&#275;sis\. <B>{Sincerity of God}</B> <b><i>(\eilikrinei&#257;i tou theou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Like \dikaiosun&#275; theou\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:17; 3:21)</i></b>, the God-kind of<br>
 righteousness. So the God-kind <b><i>(genitive case)</i></b> of sincerity. Late<br>
 word from \eilikrin&#275;s\. See on &#175;1Co 5:8. <B>{Not in fleshly wisdom}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ouk en sophi&#257;i sarkik&#275;i\)</i></b>. See on &#175;1Co 1:17; 2:4,13f. Paul<br>
 uses \sarkikos\ five times and it occurs only twice elsewhere in<br>
 N.T. See on &#175;1Co 3:3. <B>{We behaved ourselves}</B> <b><i>(\anestraph&#275;men\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist passive indicative of \anastreph&#333;\, old verb, to<br>
 turn back, to turn back and forth, to walk. Here the passive is<br>
 used as in late Greek as if middle. <B>{More abundantly to you-ward}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\perissoter&#333;s pros humas\)</i></b>. They had more abundant opportunity<br>
 to observe how scrupulous Paul was <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:11)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:13 <B>{Than what ye read}</B> <b><i>(\all' &#275; ha anagin&#333;skete\)</i></b>. Note<br>
 comparative conjunction \&#275;\ <b><i>(than)</i></b> after \all'\ and that after<br>
 \alla\ <b><i>(other things, same word in reality)</i></b>, "other than." Read<br>
 in Greek <b><i>(\anagin&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b> is knowing again, recognizing. See on &#175;Ac<br>
 8:30. <B>{Or even acknowledge}</B> <b><i>(\&#275; kai epigin&#333;skete\)</i></b>. Paul is fond<br>
 of such a play on words <b><i>(\anagin&#333;skete, epigin&#333;skete\)</i></b> or<br>
 paronomasia. Does he mean "read between the lines," as we say, by<br>
 the use of \epi\ <b><i>(additional knowledge)</i></b>? <B>{Unto the end}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s<br>
 telous\)</i></b>. The report of Titus showed that the majority now at<br>
 last understood Paul. He hopes that it will last <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 1:8)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:14 <B>{As also ye did acknowledge us in part}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s kai<br>
 epegn&#333;te h&#275;mas apo merous\)</i></b>. Gracious acknowledgment <b><i>(second<br>
 aorist active indicative of \epign&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b> to the original Pauline<br>
 party <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 1:12; 3:4)</i></b> that he had seemed to care so little for<br>
 them. And now in his hour of victory he shows that, if he is<br>
 their ground of glorying, they are his also <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1Th 2:19f.; Php<br>
 2:16)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:15 <B>{Confidence}</B> <b><i>(\pepoith&#275;sei\)</i></b>. This late word <b><i>(LXX Philo,<br>
 Josephus)</i></b> is condemned by the Atticists, but Paul uses it a half<br>
 dozen times <b><i>(<!-#-->3:4 also)</i></b>. <B>{I was minded to come}</B> <b><i>(\eboulom&#275;n<br>
 elthein\)</i></b>. Imperfect, I was wishing to come, picturing his former<br>
 state of mind. <B>{Before unto you}</B> <b><i>(\proteron pros humas\)</i></b>. This<br>
 was his former plan <b><i>(\proteron\)</i></b> while in Ephesus to go to Achaia<br>
 directly from Ephesus. This he confesses in verse <!-#-->16 "and by<br>
 you to pass into Macedonia." <B>{That ye might have a second<br>
 benefit}</B> <b><i>(\hina deuteran charin sch&#275;te\)</i></b>. Or second "joy" if we<br>
 accept \charan\ with Westcott and Hort. This would be a real<br>
 second blessing <b><i>(or joy)</i></b> if they should have two visits from<br>
 Paul.<br>
 <br>
 1:16 <B>{And again}</B> <b><i>(\kai palin\)</i></b>. This would have been the second<br>
 benefit or joy. But he changed his plans and did not make that<br>
 trip directly to Corinth, but came on to Macedonia first <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 19:21; 20:1f.; 1Co 16:2; 2Co 2:12)</i></b>. <B>{To be set forward by you}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\huph' hum&#333;n propemphth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist passive infinitive<br>
 of \propemp&#333;\. Paul uses this same verb in <!-#-->Ro 15:24 for the<br>
 same service by the Roman Christians on his proposed trip to<br>
 Spain. The Corinthians, especially the anti-Pauline party, took<br>
 advantage of Paul's change of plans to criticize him sharply for<br>
 vacillation and flippancy. How easy it is to find fault with the<br>
 preacher! So Paul has to explain his conduct.<br>
 <br>
 1:17 <B>{Did I shew fickleness?}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;ti ara t&#275;i elaphri&#257;i?\)</i></b>. An<br>
 indignant negative answer is called for by \m&#275;ti\. The<br>
 instrumental case of \elaphri&#257;i\ is regular after \echr&#275;sam&#275;n\<br>
 from \chraomai\, to use. \Elaphria\ is a late word for levity<br>
 from the old adjective, \elaphros\, light, agile <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 10:17; Mt<br>
 11:30)</i></b>. Here only in N.T. <B>{Purpose}</B> <b><i>(\bouleuomai\)</i></b>. Paul raises<br>
 the question of fickleness about any of his plans. <B>{Yea yea}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Nai nai\)</i></b> <B>{--nay nay}</B> <b><i>(\ou ou\)</i></b>. See a similar repetition in<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 5:37. It is plain in <!-#-->Jas 5:12 where "the yea" is "yea" and<br>
 "the nay" is "nay." That seems to be Paul's meaning here, "that<br>
 the Yea may be yea and the Nay may be nay."<br>
 <br>
 1:18 <B>{Is not yea and nay}</B> <b><i>(\ouk estin nai kai ou\)</i></b>. He is not a<br>
 Yes and No man, saying Yes and meaning or acting No. Paul calls<br>
 God to witness on this point.<br>
 <br>
 1:19 <B>{Was not Yea and Nay}</B> <b><i>(\ouk egeneto nai kai ou\)</i></b>. "Did not<br>
 become Yes and No." <B>{But in him is yea}</B> <b><i>(\alla Nai en aut&#333;i<br>
 gegonen\)</i></b>. Rather, "But in him Yes has become yes," has proved<br>
 true. So Paul appeals to the life of Christ to sustain his own<br>
 veracity.<br>
 <br>
 1:20 <B>{In him is the yea}</B> <b><i>(\en aut&#333;i to Nai\)</i></b>. Supply \gegonen\<br>
 from the preceding sentence, "In him was the Yea come true." This<br>
 applies to all God's promises. <B>{The Amen}</B> <b><i>(\to Am&#275;n\)</i></b>. In public<br>
 worship <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 14:16)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:21 <B>{Establishes}</B> <b><i>(\bebai&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present active participle from<br>
 \bebaios\, firm. An apt metaphor in Corinth where confirmation of<br>
 a bargain often took place <b><i>(\bebai&#333;sis\)</i></b> as Deissmann shows<br>
 <b><i>(_Bible Studies_, p. 109)</i></b> and as verse <!-#-->22 makes plain.<br>
 <B>{Anointed}</B> <b><i>(\chrisas\)</i></b>. From \chri&#333;\, to anoint, old verb, to<br>
 consecrate, with the Holy Spirit here as in <!-#-->1Jo 2:20.<br>
 <br>
 1:22 <B>{Sealed us}</B> <b><i>(\sphragisamenos h&#275;mas\)</i></b>. From \sphragiz&#333;\ old<br>
 verb, common in LXX and papyri for setting a seal to prevent<br>
 opening <b><i>(<!-#-->Da 6:17)</i></b>, in place of signature <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ki 21:18)</i></b>. Papyri<br>
 examples show a wide legal use to give validity to documents, to<br>
 guarantee genuineness of articles as sealing sacks and chests,<br>
 etc. <b><i>(Deissmann, _Bible Studies_, p. 238; Moulton and Milligan's<br>
 _Vocabulary_)</i></b>. <B>{The earnest of the Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\ton arrab&#333;na tou<br>
 pneumatos\)</i></b>. A word of Semitic origin <b><i>(possibly Phoenician)</i></b> and<br>
 spelled both \arab&#333;n\ and \arrab&#333;n\. It is common in the papyri<br>
 as earnest money in a purchase for a cow or for a wife <b><i>(a dowry)</i></b>.<br>
 In N.T. only here; <!-#-->5:5; Eph 1:14. It is part payment on the<br>
 total obligation and we use the very expression today, "earnest<br>
 money." It is God, says Paul, who has done all this for us and<br>
 God is Paul's pledge that he is sincere. He will come to Corinth<br>
 in due time. This earnest of the Spirit in our hearts is the<br>
 witness of the Spirit that we are God's.<br>
 <br>
 1:23 <B>{But I call God for a witness upon my soul}</B> <b><i>(\Eg&#333; de martura<br>
 ton theon epikaloumai epi t&#275;n em&#275;n psuch&#275;n\)</i></b>. Solemn attestation,<br>
 "calling heaven to witness is frequent in literature from Homer<br>
 onwards" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. Thus God is described above <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1Th 2:5,10;<br>
 Ro 1:9; Ga 1:20; Php 1:8)</i></b>. <B>{To spare you}</B> <b><i>(\pheidomenos hum&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present middle participle <b><i>(causal rather than final)</i></b> of<br>
 \pheidomai\, old verb, to hold back, to spare. Ablative case<br>
 \hum&#333;n\.<br>
 <br>
 1:24 <B>{We have lordship over}</B> <b><i>(\kurieuomen\)</i></b>. Old verb from<br>
 \kurios\, to be lord of or over. See <!-#-->Lu 22:25. <B>{Helpers of your<br>
 joy}</B> <b><i>(\sunergoi t&#275;s charas hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Co-workers <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 3:8)</i></b> in<br>
 your joy. A delicate correction to present misapprehension<br>
 <b><i>(\epanorth&#333;sis\)</i></b>.<br>
