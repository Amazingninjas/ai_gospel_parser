<p>4:1 <B>{That which is just and equal}</B> <b><i>(\to dikaion kai t&#275;n<br>
 isot&#275;ta\)</i></b>. Paul changes from \to ison\ <b><i>(like \to dikaion\, neuter<br>
 singular adjective with article for abstract idea)</i></b> to the<br>
 abstract substantive \isot&#275;s\, old word, in N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->2Co 8:13f. If employers always did this, there would be no<br>
 labour problem. <B>{A Master in heaven}</B> <b><i>(\Kurion en ouran&#333;i\)</i></b>. A<br>
 wholesome reminder to the effect that he keeps his eye on the<br>
 conduct of masters of men here towards their employees.<br>
 <br>
 4:2 <B>{Continue steadfastly}</B> <b><i>(\proskartereite\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mr 3:9; Ac<br>
 2:42,46 for this interesting word from \pros\ and \karteros\<br>
 <b><i>(strong)</i></b>, common in the _Koin&#275;_. <B>{Watching}</B> <b><i>(\gr&#275;gorountes\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present active participle of \gr&#275;gore&#333;\, late present made on<br>
 perfect active stem \egr&#275;gora\ with loss of \e-\, found first in<br>
 Aristotle.<br>
 <br>
 4:3 <B>{Withal}</B> <b><i>(\hama\)</i></b>. At the same time. <B>{That God may open}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hina ho theos anoix&#275;i\)</i></b>. Common use of \hina\ and the<br>
 subjunctive <b><i>(aorist)</i></b>, the sub-final use so common in the N.T. as<br>
 in the _Koin&#275;_. <B>{A door for the word}</B> <b><i>(\thuran tou logou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Objective genitive, a door for preaching. It is comforting to<br>
 other preachers to see the greatest of all preachers here asking<br>
 prayer that he may be set free again to preach. He uses this<br>
 figure elsewhere, once of a great and open door with many<br>
 adversaries in Ephesus <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 16:9)</i></b>, once of an open door that he<br>
 could not enter in Troas <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 2:12)</i></b>. <B>{The mystery of Christ}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\to must&#275;rion tou Christou\)</i></b>. The genitive of apposition, the<br>
 mystery which is Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->2:2)</i></b>, one that puts out of comparison<br>
 the foolish "mysteries" of the Gnostics. <B>{For which I am also in<br>
 bonds}</B> <b><i>(\di' ho kai dedemai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative of<br>
 \de&#333;\. Paul is always conscious of this limitation, this chain.<br>
 At bottom he is a prisoner because of his preaching to the<br>
 Gentiles.<br>
 <br>
 4:4 <B>{As I ought to speak}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s dei me lal&#275;sai\)</i></b>. Wonderful as<br>
 Paul's preaching was to his hearers and seems to us, he was never<br>
 satisfied with it. What preacher can be?<br>
 <br>
 4:5 <B>{Toward them that are without}</B> <b><i>(\pros tous ex&#333;\)</i></b>. A Pauline<br>
 phrase for those outside the churches <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 5:12; 1Co 5:12f.)</i></b>.<br>
 It takes wise walking to win them to Christ. <B>{Redeeming the time}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ton kairon exagorazomenoi\)</i></b>. We all have the same time. Paul<br>
 goes into the open market and buys it up by using it rightly. See<br>
 the same metaphor in <!-#-->Eph 5:16.<br>
 <br>
 4:6 <B>{Seasoned with salt}</B> <b><i>(\halati &#275;rtumenos\)</i></b>. The same verb<br>
 \artu&#333;\ <b><i>(old verb from \air&#333;\, to fit, to arrange)</i></b> about salt in<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 9:50; Lu 14:34. Nowhere else in the N.T. Not too much salt,<br>
 not too little. Plutarch uses salt of speech, the wit which<br>
 flavours speech <b><i>(cf. Attic salt)</i></b>. Our word salacious is this same<br>
 word degenerated into vulgarity. Grace and salt <b><i>(wit, sense)</i></b> make<br>
 an ideal combination. Every teacher will sympathize with Paul's<br>
 desire "that ye know how ye must answer each one" <b><i>(\eidenai p&#333;s<br>
 dei humas heni ekast&#333;i apokrinesthai\)</i></b>. Who does know?<br>
 <br>
 4:7 <B>{All my affairs}</B> <b><i>(\ta kat' eme panta\)</i></b>. "All the things<br>
 relating to me." The accusative case the object of \gn&#333;risei\.<br>
 The same idiom in <!-#-->Ac 25:14; Php 1:2. <B>{Tychicus}</B> <b><i>(\Tuchikos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Mentioned also in <!-#-->Eph 6:21 as the bearer of that Epistle and<br>
 with the same verb \gn&#333;risei\ <b><i>(future active of \gn&#333;riz&#333;\)</i></b> and<br>
 with the same descriptive epithet as here <b><i>(\ho agap&#275;tos adelphos<br>
 kai pistos diakonos en Kuri&#333;i\, the beloved brother and faithful<br>
 minister in the Lord)</i></b> except that here we have also \kai<br>
 sundoulos\ <b><i>(and fellow-servant)</i></b>. Abbott suggests that Paul adds<br>
 \sundoulos\ because he had used it of Epaphras in <!-#-->1:7. Perhaps<br>
 \pistos\ goes with both substantives and means faithful to Paul<br>
 as well as to Christ.<br>
 <br>
 4:8 <B>{I have sent}</B> <b><i>(\epempsa\)</i></b>. Epistolary aorist active<br>
 indicative of \pemp&#333;\ as in <!-#-->Eph 6:22. <B>{That ye may know}</B> <b><i>(\hina<br>
 gn&#333;te\)</i></b>. Second aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active subjunctive of<br>
 \gin&#333;sk&#333;\, "that ye may come to know." This the correct text, not<br>
 \gn&#333;i\ <b><i>(third singular)</i></b>. <B>{Our estate}</B> <b><i>(\ta peri h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. "The<br>
 things concerning us." <B>{May comfort}</B> <b><i>(\parakales&#275;i\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active subjunctive. Proper rendering here and not "may<br>
 exhort."<br>
 <br>
 4:9 <B>{Together with Onesimus}</B> <b><i>(\sun On&#275;sim&#333;i\)</i></b>. Co-bearer of the<br>
 letter with Tychicus and praised on a par with him, runaway slave<br>
 though he is. <B>{Who is one of you}</B> <b><i>(\hos estin ex hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Said<br>
 not as a reproach to Colossae for having such a man, but as a<br>
 privilege to the church in Colossae to give a proper welcome to<br>
 this returning converted slave and to treat him as a brother as<br>
 Paul argues to Philemon.<br>
 <br>
 4:10 <B>{Aristarchus}</B> <b><i>(\Aristarchos\)</i></b>. He was from Thessalonica and<br>
 accompanied Paul to Jerusalem with the collection <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 19:29;<br>
 20:4)</i></b> and started with Paul to Rome <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 27:2; Phm 1:24)</i></b>.<br>
 Whether he has been with Paul all the time in Rome we do not<br>
 know, but he is here now. <B>{My fellow-prisoner}</B> <b><i>(\ho<br>
 sunaichmal&#333;tos mou\)</i></b>. One of Paul's compounds, found elsewhere<br>
 only in Lucian. Paul uses it of Epaphras in <!-#-->Phm 1:23, but<br>
 whether of actual voluntary imprisonment or of spiritual<br>
 imprisonment like \sunstrati&#333;tes\ <b><i>(fellow-soldier)</i></b> in <!-#-->Php 2:25;<br>
 Phm 1:2 we do not know. Abbott argues for a literal imprisonment<br>
 and it is possible that some of Paul's co-workers <b><i>(\sun-ergoi\)</i></b><br>
 voluntarily shared imprisonment with him by turns. <B>{Mark}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Markos\)</i></b>. Once rejected by Paul for his defection in the work<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:36-39)</i></b>, but now cordially commended because he had made<br>
 good again. <B>{The cousin of Barnabas}</B> <b><i>(\ho anepsios Barnab&#257;\)</i></b>. It<br>
 was used for "nephew" very late, clearly "cousin" here and common<br>
 so in the papyri. This kinship explains the interest of Barnabas<br>
 in Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 12:25; 13:5; 15:36-39)</i></b>. <B>{If he come unto you,<br>
 receive him}</B> <b><i>(\ean elth&#275;i pros humas dexasthe auton\)</i></b>. This third<br>
 class conditional sentence <b><i>(\ean\ and second aorist active<br>
 subjunctive of \erchomai\)</i></b> gives the substance of the commands<br>
 <b><i>(\entolas\)</i></b> about Mark already sent, how we do not know. But<br>
 Paul's commendation of Mark is hearty and unreserved as he does<br>
 later in <!-#-->2Ti 4:11. The verb \dechomai\ is the usual one for<br>
 hospitable reception <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:14; Joh 4:45)</i></b> like \prosdechomai\<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 2:29)</i></b> and \hupodechomai\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 10:38)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:11 <B>{Jesus which is called Justus}</B> <b><i>(\I&#275;sous ho legomenos<br>
 Ioustos\)</i></b>. Another illustration of the frequency of the name<br>
 Jesus <b><i>(Joshua)</i></b>. The surname Justus is the Latin _Justus_ for the<br>
 Greek \Dikaios\ and the Hebrew _Zadok_ and very common as a<br>
 surname among the Jews. The name appears for two others in the<br>
 N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 1:23; 18:7)</i></b>. <B>{Who are of the circumcision}</B> <b><i>(\hoi ontes<br>
 ek peritom&#275;s\)</i></b>. Jewish Christians certainly, but not necessarily<br>
 Judaizers like those so termed in <!-#-->Ac 11:3 <b><i>(\hoi ek peritom&#275;s\.<br>
 Cf. <!-#-->Ac 35:1,5)</i></b>. <B>{These only}</B> <b><i>(\houtoi monoi\)</i></b>. "Of the<br>
 circumcision" <b><i>(Jews)</i></b> he means. <B>{A comfort unto me}</B> <b><i>(\moi<br>
 par&#275;goria\)</i></b>. Ethical dative of personal interest. \Par&#275;goria\ is<br>
 an old word <b><i>(here only in N.T.)</i></b> from \par&#275;gore&#333;\, to make an<br>
 address)</i></b> and means solace, relief. A medical term. Curiously<br>
 enough our word paregoric comes from it <b><i>(\par&#275;gorikos\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:12 <B>{Epaphras who is one of you}</B> <b><i>(\Epaphr&#257;s ho ex hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. See<br>
 <!-#-->1:7 for previous mention of this brother who had brought Paul<br>
 news from Colossae. <B>{Always striving for you}</B> <b><i>(\pantote<br>
 ag&#333;nizomenos huper h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->1:29 of Paul. <B>{That ye may<br>
 stand}</B> <b><i>(\hina stath&#275;te\)</i></b>. Final clause, first aorist passive<br>
 subjunctive <b><i>(according to Aleph B)</i></b> rather than the usual second<br>
 aorist active subjunctives <b><i>(\st&#275;te\)</i></b> of \hist&#275;mi\ <b><i>(according to A<br>
 C D)</i></b>. <B>{Fully assured}</B> <b><i>(\pepl&#275;rophor&#275;menoi\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle of \pl&#275;rophore&#333;\, late compound, for which see <!-#-->Lu<br>
 1:1; Ro 14:5.<br>
 <br>
 4:13 <B>{And for them in Hierapolis}</B> <b><i>(\kai t&#333;n en Hier&#257;i Polei\)</i></b>.<br>
 The third of the three cities in the Lycus Valley which had not<br>
 seen Paul's face <b><i>(<!-#-->2:1)</i></b>. It was across the valley from Laodicea.<br>
 Probably Epaphras had evangelized all three cities and all were<br>
 in peril from the Gnostics.<br>
 <br>
 4:14 <B>{Luke, the beloved physician}</B> <b><i>(\Loukas ho iatros ho<br>
 agap&#275;tos\)</i></b>. Mentioned also in <!-#-->Phm 1:24; 2Ti 4:11. The author of<br>
 the Gospel and the Acts. Both Mark and Luke are with Paul at this<br>
 time, possibly also with copies of their Gospels with them. The<br>
 article here <b><i>(repeated)</i></b> may mean "my beloved physician." It would<br>
 seem certain that Luke looked after Paul's health and that Paul<br>
 loved him. Paul was Luke's hero, but it was not a one-sided<br>
 affection. It is beautiful to see preacher and physician warm<br>
 friends in the community. <B>{Demas}</B> <b><i>(\D&#275;mas\)</i></b>. Just his name here<br>
 <b><i>(a contraction of Demetrius)</i></b>, but in <!-#-->2Ti 4:10 he is mentioned<br>
 as one who deserted Paul.<br>
 <br>
 4:15 <B>{Nymphas}</B> <b><i>(\Numphan\)</i></b>. That is masculine, if \autou\ <b><i>(his)</i></b><br>
 is genuine <b><i>(D E K L)</i></b> after \kat' oikon\, but \Numpha\ <b><i>(feminine)</i></b><br>
 if \aut&#275;s\ <b><i>(her)</i></b> is read <b><i>(B 67)</i></b>. Aleph A C P read \aut&#333;n\<br>
 <b><i>(their)</i></b>, perhaps including \adelphous\ <b><i>(brethren)</i></b> and so locating<br>
 this church <b><i>(\ekkl&#275;sia\)</i></b> in Laodicea. It was not till the third<br>
 century that separate buildings were used for church worship. See<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 16:5 for Prisca and Aquila. It is not possible to tell<br>
 whether it is "her" or "his" house here.<br>
 <br>
 4:16 <B>{When this epistle hath been read among you}</B> <b><i>(\hotan<br>
 anagn&#333;sth&#275;i par' humin h&#275; epistol&#275;\)</i></b>. Indefinite temporal clause<br>
 with \hotan\ <b><i>(\hote an\)</i></b> and the first aorist passive subjunctive<br>
 of \anagin&#333;sk&#333;\. The epistle was read in public to the church<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 1:3)</i></b>. <B>{Cause that}</B> <b><i>(\poi&#275;sate hina\)</i></b>. Same idiom in <!-#-->Joh<br>
 11:37; Re 13:15. Old Greek preferred \hop&#333;s\ for this idiom. See<br>
 <!-#-->1Th 5:27 for injunction for public reading of the Epistle.<br>
 <B>{That ye also read}</B> <b><i>(\kai humeis anagn&#333;te\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 subjunctive of \anagin&#333;sk&#333;\, to read. <B>{And the epistle from<br>
 Laodicea}</B> <b><i>(\kai t&#275;n ek Laodikias\)</i></b>. The most likely meaning is<br>
 that the so-called Epistle to the Ephesians was a circular letter<br>
 to various churches in the province of Asia, one copy going to<br>
 Laodicea and to be passed on to Colossae as the Colossian letter<br>
 was to be sent on to Laodicea. This was done usually by copying<br>
 and keeping the original. See <!-#-->Eph 1:1 for further discussion of<br>
 this matter.<br>
 <br>
 4:17 <B>{Take heed}</B> <b><i>(\blepe\)</i></b>. Keep an eye on. <B>{Thou hast received<br>
 in the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\parelabes en Kuri&#333;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative of \paralamban&#333;\, the verb used by Paul of getting his<br>
 message from the Lord <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:3)</i></b>. Clearly Archippus had a call<br>
 "in the Lord" as every preacher should have. <B>{That thou fulfil<br>
 it}</B> <b><i>(\hina aut&#275;n pl&#275;rois\)</i></b>. Present active subjunctive of<br>
 \pl&#275;ro&#333;\, "that thou keep on filling it full." It is a life-time<br>
 job.<br>
 <br>
 4:18 <B>{Of me Paul with mine own hand}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i em&#275;i cheiri Paulou\)</i></b>.<br>
 More precisely, "with the hand of me Paul." The genitive \Paulou\<br>
 is in apposition with the idea in the possessive pronoun \em&#275;i\,<br>
 which is itself in the instrumental case agreeing with \cheiri\.<br>
 So also <!-#-->2Th 3:17; 1Co 16:21. <B>{My bonds}</B> <b><i>(\mou t&#333;n desm&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive case with \mnemoneuete\ <b><i>(remember)</i></b>. The chain <b><i>(\en<br>
 halusei\ <!-#-->Eph 6:20)</i></b> clanked afresh as Paul took the pen to sign<br>
 the salutation. He was not likely to forget it himself<br>
 <br>
