<p>5:1 <B>{Pressed upon him}</B> <b><i>(\epikeisthai\)</i></b>. Luke in this paragraph<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->5:1-11; Mr 1:16-20; Mt 4:18-22)</i></b> does not follow the chronology<br>
 of Mark as he usually does. It seems reasonably clear that the<br>
 renewed call of the four fishermen came before the first tour of<br>
 Galilee in <!-#-->Lu 4:42-44. It is here assumed that Luke is<br>
 describing in his own way the incident given in Mark and Matthew<br>
 above. Luke singles out Simon in a graphic way. This verb<br>
 \epikeisthai\ is an old one and means to \lie upon\, rest upon as<br>
 of a stone on the tomb <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 11:38)</i></b> or of fish on the burning<br>
 coals <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 21:9)</i></b>. So it is used of a tempest <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 27:20)</i></b> and<br>
 of the urgent demands for Christ's crucifixion <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:23)</i></b>. Here<br>
 it vividly pictures the eager crowds around Jesus. \En t&#333;i<br>
 epikeisthai\ is a favourite idiom with Luke as we have already<br>
 seen, \en\ with the articular infinitive in the locative case.<br>
 <B>{That}</B> <b><i>(\kai\)</i></b>. \Kai\ does not technically mean the declarative<br>
 conjunction "that," but it is a fair rendering of the somewhat<br>
 awkward idiom of Luke to a certain extent imitating the Hebrew<br>
 use of _wav_. <B>{Was standing}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n hest&#333;s\)</i></b>. Periphrastic second<br>
 past perfect of \hist&#275;mi\ which here is equal to a practical<br>
 imperfect. <B>{By the lake}</B> <b><i>(\para t&#275;n limn&#275;n\)</i></b>. The use of the<br>
 accusative with \para\, alongside, after a verb of rest used to<br>
 be called the pregnant use, came and was standing. But that is no<br>
 longer necessary, for the accusative as the case of extension is<br>
 the oldest of the cases and in later Greek regains many of the<br>
 earlier uses of the other cases employed for more precise<br>
 distinctions. See the same idiom in verse <!-#-->2. We need not here<br>
 stress the notion of extension. "With characteristic accuracy<br>
 Luke never calls it a sea, while the others never call it a lake"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:2 <B>{Two boats}</B> <b><i>(\ploia duo\)</i></b>. Some MSS. have \ploiaria\, little<br>
 boats, but \ploia\ was used of boats of various sizes, even of<br>
 ships like \n&#275;es\. <B>{The fishermen}</B> <b><i>(\hoi haleeis\)</i></b>. It is an old<br>
 Homeric word that has come back to common use in the _Koin&#275;_. It<br>
 means "sea-folk" from \hals\, sea. <B>{Were washing}</B> <b><i>(\eplunon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active, though some MSS. have aorist \eplunan\. Vincent<br>
 comments on Luke's use of five verbs for washing: this one for<br>
 cleaning, \apomass&#333;\ for wiping the dust from one's feet<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->10:11)</i></b>, \ekmass&#333;\ of the sinful woman wiping Christ's feet<br>
 with her hair <b><i>(<!-#-->7:38,44)</i></b>, \apolou&#333;\ of washing away sins<br>
 <b><i>(symbolically, of course)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Ac 22:16, and \lou&#333;\ of washing<br>
 the body of Dorcas <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 9:37)</i></b> and the stripes of the prisoners<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 16:33)</i></b>. On "nets" see on &#175;Mt 4:20; Mr 1:18.<br>
 <br>
 5:3 <B>{To put out a little}</B> <b><i>(\epanagagein oligon\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 infinitive of the double compound verb \ep-an-ag&#333;\, found in<br>
 Xenophon and late Greek writers generally. Only twice in the N.T.<br>
 In <!-#-->Mt 21:18 in the sense of leading back or returning and here<br>
 in the sense of leading a ship up upon the sea, to put out to<br>
 sea, a nautical term. <B>{Taught}</B> <b><i>(\edikasken\)</i></b>. Imperfect active,<br>
 picturing Jesus teaching from the boat in which he was seated and<br>
 so safe from the jam of the crowd. "Christ uses Peter's boat as a<br>
 pulpit whence to throw the net of the Gospel over His hearers"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:4 <B>{Had left speaking}</B> <b><i>(\epausato lal&#333;n\)</i></b>. He ceased speaking<br>
 <b><i>(aorist middle indicative and present active participle, regular<br>
 Greek idiom)</i></b>. <B>{Put out into the deep}</B> <b><i>(\epanagage eis to<br>
 bathos\)</i></b>. The same double compound verb as in verse <!-#-->3, only<br>
 here second aorist active imperative second person singular. <B>{Let<br>
 down}</B> <b><i>(\chalasate\)</i></b>. Peter was master of the craft and so he was<br>
 addressed first. First aorist active imperative second person<br>
 plural. Here the whole crew are addressed. The verb is the<br>
 regular nautical term for lowering cargo or boats <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 27:17,30)</i></b>. But it was used for lowering anything from a higher<br>
 place <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 2:4; Ac 9:25; 2Co 11:33)</i></b>. For a catch <b><i>(\eis agran\)</i></b>.<br>
 This purpose was the startling thing that stirred up Simon.<br>
 <br>
 5:5 <B>{Master}</B> <b><i>(\epistata\)</i></b>. Used only by Luke in the N.T. and<br>
 always in addresses to Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->8:24,45; 9:33,49; 17:13)</i></b>. Common<br>
 in the older writers for superintendent or overseer <b><i>(one standing<br>
 over another)</i></b>. This word recognizes Christ's authority. <B>{We<br>
 toiled}</B> <b><i>(\kopiasantes\)</i></b>. This verb is from \kopos\ <b><i>(\work, toil\)</i></b><br>
 and occurs from Aristophanes on. It used to be said that the<br>
 notion of weariness in toil appears only in the LXX and the N.T.<br>
 But Deissmann <b><i>(_Light from the Ancient East_, pp. 312f.)</i></b> cites<br>
 examples from inscriptions on tombstones quite in harmony with<br>
 the use in the N.T. Peter's protest calls attention also to the<br>
 whole night of fruitless toil. <B>{But at thy word}</B> <b><i>(\epi de t&#333;i<br>
 rh&#275;mati sou\)</i></b>. On the base of \epi\. Acquiescence to show his<br>
 obedience to Christ as "Master," but with no confidence<br>
 whatsoever in the wisdom of this particular command. Besides,<br>
 fishing in this lake was Peter's business and he really claimed<br>
 superior knowledge on this occasion to that of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 5:6 <B>{They inclosed}</B> <b><i>(\sunekleisan\)</i></b>. Effective aorist active<br>
 indicative with perfective compound \sun\. <B>{They shut together.<br>
 Were breaking}</B> <b><i>(\dier&#275;sseto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive singular<br>
 <b><i>(\diktua\ being neuter plural)</i></b>. This is the late form of the old<br>
 verb \diar&#275;gnumi\. The nets were actually tearing in two <b><i>(\dia-\)</i></b><br>
 and so they would lose all the fish.<br>
 <br>
 5:7 <B>{They beckoned}</B> <b><i>(\kateneusan\)</i></b>. Possibly they were too far<br>
 away for a call to be understood. Simon alone had been ordered to<br>
 put out into the deep. So they used signs. <B>{Unto their partners}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\tois metechois\)</i></b>. This word \metochos\, from \metech&#333;\, to have<br>
 with, means participation with one in common blessings <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb<br>
 3:1,14; 6:4; 12:8)</i></b>. While \koin&#333;nos\ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->10 here of James<br>
 and John also)</i></b> has the notion of personal fellowship,<br>
 partnership. Both terms are here employed of the two pairs of<br>
 brothers who have a business company under Simon's lead. <B>{Help<br>
 them}</B> <b><i>(\sullabesthai\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle infinitive. Take<br>
 hold together with and so to help. Paul uses it in <!-#-->Php 4:3. It<br>
 is an old word that was sometimes employed for seizing a prisoner<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:54)</i></b> and for conception <b><i>(_con-capio_)</i></b> by a woman <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 1:24)</i></b>. <B>{So that they began to sink}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste buthizesthai auta\)</i></b>.<br>
 Consecutive use of \h&#333;ste\ and the infinitive <b><i>(present tense,<br>
 inchoative use, beginning to sink)</i></b>. An old verb from \buthos\. In<br>
 the N.T. only here and <!-#-->1Ti 6:9.<br>
 <br>
 5:8 <B>{Fell down at Jesus' knees}</B> <b><i>(\prosepesen tois gonasin<br>
 I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. Just like Peter, from extreme self-confidence and pride<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->5)</i></b> to abject humilation. But his impulse here was right<br>
 and sincere. His confession was true. He was a sinful man.<br>
 <br>
 5:9 <B>{For he was amazed}</B> <b><i>(\thambos gar perieschen\)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 <B>{For a wonder held him round}</B>. Aorist active indicative. It held<br>
 Peter fast and all the rest.<br>
 <br>
 5:10 <B>{Thou shalt catch men}</B> <b><i>(\es&#275;i z&#333;gr&#333;n\)</i></b>. Periphrastic future<br>
 indicative, emphasizing the linear idea. The old verb \Z&#333;gre&#333;\<br>
 means to catch alive, not to kill. So then Peter is to be a<br>
 catcher of men, not of fish, and to catch them alive and for<br>
 life, not dead and for death. The great Pentecost will one day<br>
 prove that Christ's prophecy will come true. Much must happen<br>
 before that great day. But Jesus foresees the possibilities in<br>
 Simon and he joyfully undertakes the task of making a fisher of<br>
 men out of this poor fisher of fish.<br>
 <br>
 5:11 <B>{They left all, and followed him}</B> <b><i>(\aphentes panta<br>
 &#275;kolouth&#275;san\)</i></b>. Then and there. They had already become his<br>
 disciples. Now they leave their business for active service of<br>
 Christ. The conduct of this group of business men should make<br>
 other business men to pause and see if Jesus is calling them to<br>
 do likewise.<br>
 <br>
 5:12 <B>{Behold}</B> <b><i>(\kai idou\)</i></b>. Quite a Hebraistic idiom, this use of<br>
 \kai\ after \egeneto\ <b><i>(almost like \hoti\)</i></b> with \idou\<br>
 <b><i>(interjection)</i></b> and no verb. <B>{Full of leprosy}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;r&#275;s lepras\)</i></b>.<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 1:40 and <!-#-->Mt 8:2 have simply "a leper" which see. Evidently<br>
 a bad case full of sores and far advanced as Luke the physician<br>
 notes. The law <b><i>(<!-#-->Le 13:12f.)</i></b> curiously treated advanced cases as<br>
 less unclean than the earlier stages. <B>{Fell on his face}</B> <b><i>(\pes&#333;n<br>
 epi pros&#333;pon\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of \pipt&#333;\,<br>
 common verb. <!-#-->Mr 1:40 has "kneeling" <b><i>(\gonupet&#333;n\)</i></b> and <!-#-->Mt 8:40<br>
 "worshipped" <b><i>(\prosekunei\)</i></b>. All three attitudes were possible<br>
 one after the other. All three Synoptics quote the identical<br>
 language of the leper and the identical answer of Jesus. His<br>
 condition of the third class turned on the "will" <b><i>(\thel&#275;is\)</i></b> of<br>
 Jesus who at once asserts his will <b><i>(\th&#275;l&#333;\)</i></b> and cleanses him.<br>
 All three likewise mention the touch <b><i>(\h&#275;psato\, verse <!-#-->13)</i></b> of<br>
 Christ's hand on the unclean leper and the instantaneous cure.<br>
 <br>
 5:14 <B>{To tell no man}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;deni eipein\)</i></b>. This is an indirect<br>
 command after the verb "charged" <b><i>(\par&#275;ggeilen\)</i></b>. But Luke<br>
 changes <b><i>(_constructio variata_)</i></b> to the direct quotation, a common<br>
 idiom in Greek and often in Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 1:4f.)</i></b>. Here in the direct<br>
 form he follows <!-#-->Mr 1:43; Mt 8:4. See discussion there about the<br>
 direction to go to the priest to receive a certificate showing<br>
 his cleansing, like our release from quarantine <b><i>(<!-#-->Le 13:39;<br>
 14:2-32)</i></b>. <B>{For a testimony unto them}</B> <b><i>(\eis marturion autois\)</i></b>.<br>
 The use of \autois\ <b><i>(them)</i></b> here is "according to sense," as we<br>
 say, for it has no antecedent in the context, just to people in<br>
 general. But this identical phrase with absence of direct<br>
 reference occurs in Mark and Matthew, pretty good proof of the<br>
 use of one by the other. Both <!-#-->Mt 8:4; Lu 5:14 follow <!-#-->Mr 1:44.<br>
 <br>
 5:15 <B>{So much the more}</B> <b><i>(\m&#257;llon\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr 1:45 has only "much"<br>
 <b><i>(\polla\, many)</i></b>, but Mark tells more about the effect of this<br>
 disobedience. <B>{Went abroad}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;rcheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense. The<br>
 fame of Jesus kept going. <B>{Came together}</B> <b><i>(\sun&#275;rchonto\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect tense again. The more the report spread, the more the<br>
 crowds came.<br>
 <br>
 5:16 <B>{But he withdrew himself in the deserts and prayed}</B> <b><i>(\autos<br>
 de &#275;n hupoch&#333;r&#333;n en tais er&#275;mois kai proseuchomenos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic imperfects. Literally, "But he himself was with<br>
 drawing in the desert places and praying." The more the crowds<br>
 came as a result of the leper's story, the more Jesus turned away<br>
 from them to the desert regions and prayed with the Father. It is<br>
 a picture of Jesus drawn with vivid power. The wild enthusiasm of<br>
 the crowds was running ahead of their comprehension of Christ and<br>
 his mission and message. \Hupoch&#333;re&#333;\ <b><i>(perhaps with the notion of<br>
 slipping away secretly, \hupo-\)</i></b> is a very common Greek verb, but<br>
 in the N.T. occurs in Luke alone. Elsewhere in the N.T.<br>
 \anach&#333;re&#333;\ <b><i>(to go back)</i></b> appears.<br>
 <br>
 5:17 <B>{That}</B> <b><i>(\kai\)</i></b>. Use of \kai\ = \hoti\ <b><i>(that)</i></b> like the Hebrew<br>
 _wav_, though found in Greek also. <B>{He}</B> <b><i>(\autos\)</i></b>. Luke sometimes<br>
 has \autos\ in the nominative as unemphatic "he" as here, not "he<br>
 himself." <B>{Was teaching}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n didask&#333;n\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect<br>
 again like our English idiom. <B>{Were sitting by}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san<br>
 kath&#275;menoi\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect again. There is no "by" in<br>
 the Greek. <B>{Doctors of the law}</B> <b><i>(\nomodidaskaloi\)</i></b>. A compound<br>
 word formed after analogy of \hierodidaskalos\, but not found<br>
 outside of the N.T. and ecclesiastical writers, one of the very<br>
 few words apparently N.T. in usage. It appears here and <!-#-->Ac 5:34;<br>
 1Ti 1:7. It is not likely that Luke and Paul made the word, but<br>
 they simply used the term already in current use to describe<br>
 teachers and interpreters of the law. Our word "doctor" is Latin<br>
 for "teacher." These "teachers of the law" are called elsewhere<br>
 in the Gospels "scribes" <b><i>(\grammateis\)</i></b> as in Matthew and Mark<br>
 <b><i>(see on &#175;Mt 5:20; 23:34)</i></b> and <!-#-->Lu 5:21; 19:47; 21:1; 22:2. Luke<br>
 also employs \nomikos\ <b><i>(one skilled in the law, \nomos\)</i></b> as in<br>
 <!-#-->10:25. One thinks of our LL.D. <b><i>(Doctors of Civil and Canon<br>
 Law)</i></b>, for both were combined in Jewish law. They were usually<br>
 Pharisees <b><i>(mentioned here for the first time in Luke)</i></b> for which<br>
 see on &#175;Mt 3:7,20. Luke will often speak of the Pharisees<br>
 hereafter. Not all the "Pharisees" were "teachers of the law" so<br>
 that both terms often occur together as in verse <!-#-->21 where Luke<br>
 has separate articles <b><i>(\hoi grammateis kai hoi Pharisaioi\)</i></b>,<br>
 distinguishing between them, though one article may occur as in<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 5:20 or no article as here in verse <!-#-->17. Luke alone<br>
 mentions the presence here of these Pharisees and doctors of the<br>
 law "which were come" <b><i>(\hoi &#275;san el&#275;luthotes\, periphrastic past<br>
 perfect active, <B>{had come}</B>)</i></b>. <B>{Out of every village of Galilee and<br>
 Judea and Jerusalem}</B> <b><i>(\ek pas&#275;s k&#333;m&#275;s t&#275;s Galilaias kai Ioudaias<br>
 kai Ierousal&#275;m\)</i></b>. Edersheim <b><i>(_Jewish Social Life_)</i></b> observes that<br>
 the Jews distinguished Jerusalem as a separate district in Judea.<br>
 Plummer considers it hyperbole in Luke to use "every village."<br>
 But one must recall that Jesus had already made one tour of<br>
 Galilee which stirred the Pharisees and rabbis to active<br>
 opposition. Judea had already been aroused and Jerusalem was the<br>
 headquarters of the definite campaign now organized against<br>
 Jesus. One must bear in mind that <!-#-->Joh 4:1-4 shows that Jesus<br>
 had already left Jerusalem and Judea because of the jealousy of<br>
 the Pharisees. They are here on purpose to find fault and to make<br>
 charges against Jesus. One must not forget that there were many<br>
 kinds of Pharisees and that not all of them were as bad as these<br>
 legalistic and punctilious hypocrites who deserved the indictment<br>
 and exposure of Christ in <!-#-->Mt 23. Paul himself is a specimen of<br>
 the finer type of Pharisee which, however, developed into the<br>
 persecuting fanatic till Jesus changed his whole life. <B>{The power<br>
 of the Lord was with him to heal}</B> <b><i>(\dunamis Kuriou &#275;n eis to<br>
 i&#257;sthai auton\)</i></b>. So the best texts. It is neat Greek, but awkward<br>
 English: "Then was the power of the Lord for the healing as to<br>
 him <b><i>(Jesus)</i></b>." Here \Kuriou\ refers to Jehovah. <B>{Dunamis}</B><br>
 <b><i>(dynamite)</i></b> is one of the common words for "miracles"<br>
 <b><i>(\dunameis\)</i></b>. What Luke means is that Jesus had the power of the<br>
 Lord God to heal with. He does not mean that this power was<br>
 intermittent. He simply calls attention to its presence with<br>
 Jesus on this occasion.<br>
 <br>
 5:18 <B>{That was palsied}</B> <b><i>(\hos &#275;n paralelumenos\)</i></b>. Periphrastic<br>
 past perfect passive where <!-#-->Mr 2:3; Mt 9:2 have \paralutikon\<br>
 <b><i>(our paralytic)</i></b>. Luke's phrase is the technical medical term<br>
 <b><i>(Hippocrates, Galen, etc.)</i></b> rather than Mark's vernacular word<br>
 <b><i>(Ramsay, _Luke the Physician_, pp. 57f.)</i></b>. <B>{They sought}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ez&#275;toun\)</i></b>. Conative imperfect.<br>
 <br>
 5:19 <B>{By what way they might bring him in}</B> <b><i>(\poias eis enegk&#333;sin<br>
 auton\)</i></b>. Deliberative subjunctive of the direct question retained<br>
 in the indirect. <B>{The housetop}</B> <b><i>(\to d&#333;ma\)</i></b>. Very old word. The<br>
 flat roof of Jewish houses was usually reached by outside<br>
 stairway. Cf. <!-#-->Ac 10:9 where Peter went for meditation. <B>{Through<br>
 the tiles}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#333;n keram&#333;n\)</i></b>. Common and old word for the tile<br>
 roof. <!-#-->Mr 2:4 speaks of digging a hole in this tile roof. <B>{Let<br>
 him down}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#275;kan auton\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(k aorist)</i></b> effective<br>
 active of \kathi&#275;mi\, common verb. <!-#-->Mr 2:4 has historical<br>
 present \chal&#333;si\, the verb used by Jesus to Peter and in Peter's<br>
 reply <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 5:4f.)</i></b>. <B>{With his couch}</B> <b><i>(\sun t&#333;i klinidi&#333;i\)</i></b>. Also<br>
 in verse <!-#-->24. Diminutive of \klin&#275;\ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->18)</i></b> occurring in<br>
 Plutarch and _Koin&#275;_ writers. <!-#-->Mr 2:4 has \krabatton\ <b><i>(pallet)</i></b>.<br>
 It doubtless was a pallet on which the paralytic lay. <B>{Into the<br>
 midst before Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\eis to meson emprosthen tou I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. The<br>
 four friends had succeeded, probably each holding a rope to a<br>
 corner of the pallet. It was a moment of triumph over<br>
 difficulties and surprise to all in the house <b><i>(Peter's<br>
 apparently, <!-#-->Mr 2:1)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:20 <B>{Their faith}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n pistin aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. In all three Gospels.<br>
 <B>{Man}</B> <b><i>(\anthr&#333;pe\)</i></b>. Mark and Matthew have "child" or "Son"<br>
 <b><i>(\teknon\)</i></b>. Are forgiven <b><i>(\aphe&#333;ntai\)</i></b>. This Doric form of the<br>
 perfect passive indicative is for the Attic \apheintai\. It<br>
 appears also in <!-#-->Lu 5:23; 7:47,48; Joh 20:23; 1Jo 2:12. <!-#-->Mr 2:6;<br>
 Mt 9:2 have the present passive \aphientai\. Possibly this man's<br>
 malady was due to his sin as is sometimes true <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 5:14)</i></b>. The<br>
 man had faith along with that of the four, but he was still a<br>
 paralytic when Jesus forgave his sins.<br>
 <br>
 5:21 <B>{But God alone}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275; monos ho theos\)</i></b>. Mark has \heis\<br>
 <b><i>(one)</i></b> instead of \monos\ <b><i>(alone)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:22 <B>{Perceiving}</B> <b><i>(\epignous\)</i></b>. Same form <b><i>(second aorist active<br>
 participle of \epigin&#333;sk&#333;\, common verb for knowing fully)</i></b> in <!-#-->Mr<br>
 2:8. <B>{Reason ye}</B> <b><i>(\dialogizesthe\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Mr 2:8. <!-#-->Mt 9:4 has<br>
 \enthumeisthe\.<br>
 <br>
 5:24 <B>{He saith unto him that was palsied}</B> <b><i>(\eipen t&#333;i<br>
 paralelumen&#333;i\)</i></b>. This same parenthesis right in the midst of the<br>
 words of Jesus is in <!-#-->Mr 2:11; Mt 9:6, conclusive proof of<br>
 interrelation between these documents. The words of Jesus are<br>
 quoted practically alike in all three Gospels, the same purpose<br>
 also \hina eid&#275;te\ <b><i>(second perfect active subjunctive)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:25 <B>{Whereon he lay}</B> <b><i>(\eph' ho katekeito\)</i></b>. Imperfect, upon<br>
 which he had been lying down. Luke uses this phrase instead of<br>
 repeating \klinidion\ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->24)</i></b>. <B>{Glorifying God}</B> <b><i>(\doxaz&#333;n<br>
 ton theon\)</i></b>. As one can well imagine.<br>
 <br>
 5:26 <B>{Amazement}</B> <b><i>(\ekstasis\)</i></b>. Something out of its place, as the<br>
 mind. Here the people were almost beside themselves as we say<br>
 with the same idiom. See on &#175;Mr 5:42. So they kept glorifying<br>
 God <b><i>(imperfect tense, \edoxazon\)</i></b> and at the same time "were<br>
 filled with fear" <b><i>(\epl&#275;sth&#275;san phobou\, aorist passive)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Strange things}</B> <b><i>(\paradoxa\)</i></b>. Our very word paradox, contrary to<br>
 <b><i>(\para\)</i></b> received opinion <b><i>(\doxa\)</i></b>. Plato, Xenophon, and Polybius<br>
 use it. Here alone in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 5:27 <B>{A publican named Levi}</B> <b><i>(\tel&#333;nen onomati Leuein\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr<br>
 2:13 has also "The son of Alphaeus" while <!-#-->Mt 9:9 calls him<br>
 "Matthew." He had, of course, both names. All three use the same<br>
 words <b><i>(\epi to tel&#333;nion\)</i></b> for the place of toll. See discussion<br>
 of <B>{publican}</B> <b><i>(\tel&#333;n&#275;s\)</i></b> on <!-#-->Mt 9:9. All three Gospels give the<br>
 command of Jesus, <B>{Follow me}</B> <b><i>(\akolouthei\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:28 <B>{He forsook all}</B> <b><i>(\katalip&#333;n panta\)</i></b>. This detail in Luke<br>
 alone. He left his profitable business for the service of Christ.<br>
 <B>{Followed him}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kolouthei aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, perhaps<br>
 inchoative. He began at once to follow him and he kept it up.<br>
 Both <!-#-->Mr 2:14; Mt 9:9 have the aorist <b><i>(\&#275;kolouth&#275;sen\)</i></b>, perhaps<br>
 ingressive.<br>
 <br>
 5:29 <B>{A great feast}</B> <b><i>(\doch&#275;n megal&#275;n\)</i></b>. Here and in <!-#-->Lu 14:13<br>
 only in the N.T. The word \doch&#275;\, from \dechomai\, means<br>
 reception. Occurs in Plutarch and LXX. Levi made Jesus a big<br>
 reception. <B>{Publicans and others}</B> <b><i>(\tel&#333;n&#333;n kai all&#333;n\)</i></b>. Luke<br>
 declines here to use "sinners" like <!-#-->Mr 2:15 and <!-#-->Mt 9:10<br>
 though he does so in verse <!-#-->30 and in <!-#-->15:1. None but social<br>
 outcasts would eat with publicans at such a feast or barbecue,<br>
 for it was a very large affair. <B>{Were sitting at meat with them}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;san met' aut&#333;n katakeimenoi\)</i></b>. Literally, were reclining with<br>
 them <b><i>(Jesus and the disciples)</i></b>. It was a motley crew that Levi<br>
 had brought together, but he showed courage as well as loyalty to<br>
 Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 5:30 <B>{The Pharisees and their scribes}</B> <b><i>(\hoi Pharisaioi kai hoi<br>
 grammateis aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Note article with each substantive and the<br>
 order, not "scribes and Pharisees," but "the Pharisees and the<br>
 scribes of them" <b><i>(the Pharisees)</i></b>. Some manuscripts omit "their,"<br>
 but <!-#-->Mr 2:16 <b><i>(the scribes of the Pharisees)</i></b> shows that it is<br>
 correct here. Some of the scribes were Sadducees. It is only the<br>
 Pharisees who find fault here. <B>{Murmured}</B> <b><i>(\egogguzon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active. Picturesque onomatopoetic word that sounds like<br>
 its meaning. A late word used of the cooing of doves. It is like<br>
 the buzzing of bees, like \tonthorruz&#333;\ of literary Greek. They<br>
 were not invited to this feast and would not have come if they<br>
 had been. But, not being invited, they hang on the outside and<br>
 criticize the disciples of Jesus for being there. The crowd was<br>
 so large that the feast may have been served out in the open<br>
 court at Levi's house, a sort of reclining garden party. <B>{The<br>
 publicans and sinners}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n tel&#333;n&#333;n kai hamart&#333;l&#333;n\)</i></b>. Here Luke<br>
 is quoting the criticism of the critics. Note one article making<br>
 one group of all of them.<br>
 <br>
 5:31 <B>{They that are whole}</B> <b><i>(\hoi hugiainontes\)</i></b>. Old Greek word<br>
 for good health from \hugi&#275;s\, sound in body. So also in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 7:10; 15:27; 3Jo 1:2. This is the usual word for good health<br>
 used by Greek medical writers. <!-#-->Mr 2:17; Mt 9:12 have \hoi<br>
 ischuontes\ <b><i>(those who have strength)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:32 <B>{To repentance}</B> <b><i>(\eis metanoian\)</i></b>. Alone in Luke not genuine<br>
 in <!-#-->Mr 2:17; Mt 9:12. Only sinners would need a call to<br>
 repentance, a change of mind and life. For the moment Jesus<br>
 accepts the Pharisaic division between "righteous" and "sinners"<br>
 to score them and to answer their criticism. At the other times<br>
 he will show that they only pretend to be "righteous" and are<br>
 "hypocrites" in reality. But Jesus has here blazed the path for<br>
 all soul-winners. The self-satisfied are the hard ones to win and<br>
 they often resent efforts to win them to Christ.<br>
 <br>
 5:33 <B>{Often}</B> <b><i>(\pukna\)</i></b>. Only in Luke. Common word for thick,<br>
 compact, often. <B>{And make supplications}</B> <b><i>(\kai de&#275;seis<br>
 poiountai\)</i></b>. Only in Luke. <B>{But thine}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de soi\)</i></b>. Sharp<br>
 contrast between the conduct of the disciples of Jesus and those<br>
 of John and the Pharisees who here appear together as critics of<br>
 Christ and his disciples <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 2:18; Mt 9:14)</i></b>, though Luke does<br>
 not bring that out sharply. It is probable that Levi had his<br>
 reception for Jesus on one of the Jewish fast days and, if so,<br>
 this would give special edge to their criticism.<br>
 <br>
 5:34 <B>{Can ye}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; dunasthe\)</i></b>. So Luke, adding <B>{make}</B>, \poi&#275;sai\,<br>
 where Mark and Matthew have \m&#275; dunantai\. All three have \m&#275;\<br>
 and expect the answer no.<br>
 <br>
 5:35 <B>{Then in those days}</B> <b><i>(\tote en ekeinais tais h&#275;merais\)</i></b>.<br>
 Here <!-#-->Mr 2:20 has "then in that day," and <!-#-->Mt 9:15 only "then."<br>
 <br>
 5:36 <B>{Also a parable}</B> <b><i>(\kai parabol&#275;n\)</i></b>. There are three parables<br>
 here in the answer of Jesus <b><i>(the bridegroom, the patch on the<br>
 garment, the wineskin)</i></b>. They are not called parables save here,<br>
 but they are parables and Luke's language means that. <B>{Rendeth}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\schisas\)</i></b>. This in Luke alone. Common verb. Used of splitting<br>
 rocks <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:51)</i></b>. Our word schism comes from it. <B>{Putteth it}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epiballei\)</i></b>. So <!-#-->Mt 9:16 when <!-#-->Mr 2:21 has \epiraptei\ <b><i>(sews<br>
 on)</i></b>. The word for "piece" or "patch" <b><i>(\epibl&#275;ma\)</i></b> in all the<br>
 three Gospels is from the verb \epiball&#333;\, to clap on, and is in<br>
 Plutarch, Arrian, LXX, though the verb is as old as Homer. See on<br>
 Matthew and Mark for distinction between \kainos\ <b><i>(fresh)</i></b>, \neos\<br>
 <b><i>(new)</i></b>, and \palaios\ <b><i>(old)</i></b>. <B>{He will rend the new}</B> <b><i>(\kai to<br>
 kainon schisei\)</i></b>. Future active indicative. So the best MSS.<br>
 <B>{Will not agree}</B> <b><i>(\ou sumph&#333;n&#275;sei\)</i></b>. Future active indicative. So<br>
 the best manuscripts again. <B>{With the old}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i palai&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Associative instrumental case. Instead of this phrase in Luke,<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 2:21; Mt 9:16 have "a worse rent" <b><i>(\cheiron schisma\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:38 <B>{Must be put}</B> <b><i>(\bl&#275;teon\)</i></b>. This verbal adjective in \-teos\<br>
 rather than \-tos\ appears here alone in the N.T. though it is<br>
 common enough in Attic Greek. It is a survival of the literary<br>
 style. This is the impersonal use and is transitive in sense here<br>
 and governs the accusative "new wine" <b><i>(\oinon neon\)</i></b>, though the<br>
 agent is not expressed <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1097)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:39 <B>{The old is good}</B> <b><i>(\Ho palaios chr&#275;stos estin\)</i></b>. So the best<br>
 MSS. rather that \chr&#275;stoteros\, comparative <b><i>(better)</i></b>. Westcott<br>
 and Hort wrongly bracket the whole verse, though occurring in<br>
 Aleph, B C L and most of the old documents. It is absent in D and<br>
 some of the old Latin MSS. It is the philosophy of the<br>
 obscurantist, that is here pictured by Christ. "The prejudiced<br>
 person will not even try the new, or admit that it has any<br>
 merits. He knows that the old is pleasant, and suits him; and<br>
 that is enough; he is not going to change" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. This is<br>
 Christ's picture of the reactionary Pharisees.<br>
