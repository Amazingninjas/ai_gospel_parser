<p>5:1 <B>{Actually}</B> <b><i>(\hol&#333;s\)</i></b>. Literally, wholly, altogether, like<br>
 Latin _omnino_ and Greek \pant&#333;s\ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 9:22)</i></b>. So papyri have it<br>
 for "really" and also for "generally" or "everywhere" as is<br>
 possible here. See also <!-#-->6:7. With a negative it has the sense<br>
 of "not at all" as in <!-#-->15:29; Mt 5:34 the only N.T. examples,<br>
 though a common word. <B>{It is reported}</B> <b><i>(\akouetai\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 passive indicative of \akou&#333;\, to hear; so literally, it is<br>
 heard. "Fornication is heard of among you." Probably the<br>
 household of Chloe <b><i>(<!-#-->1:11)</i></b> brought this sad news <b><i>(Ellicott)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{And such}</B> <b><i>(\kai toiaut&#275;\)</i></b>. Climactic qualitative pronoun showing<br>
 the revolting character of this particular case of illicit sexual<br>
 intercourse. \Porneia\ is sometimes used <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:20,29)</i></b> of such<br>
 sin in general and not merely of the unmarried whereas \moicheia\<br>
 is technically adultery on the part of the married <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 7:21)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{As is not even among the Gentiles}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;tis oude en tois<br>
 ethnesin\)</i></b>. Height of scorn. The Corinthian Christians were<br>
 actually trying to win pagans to Christ and living more loosely<br>
 than the Corinthian heathen among whom the very word<br>
 "Corinthianize" meant to live in sexual wantonness and license.<br>
 See Cicero _pro Cluentio_, v. 14. <B>{That one of you hath his<br>
 father's wife}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste gunaika tina tou patros echein\)</i></b>. "So as<br>
 <b><i>(usual force of \h&#333;ste\)</i></b> for one to go on having <b><i>(\echein\,<br>
 present infinitive)</i></b> a wife of the <b><i>(his)</i></b> father." It was probably<br>
 a permanent union <b><i>(concubine or mistress)</i></b> of some kind without<br>
 formal marriage like <!-#-->Joh 4:8. The woman probably was not the<br>
 offender's mother <b><i>(step-mother)</i></b> and the father may have been dead<br>
 or divorced. The Jewish law prescribed stoning for this crime<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Le 18:8; 22:11; De 22:30)</i></b>. But the rabbis <b><i>(Rabbi Akibah)</i></b><br>
 invented a subterfuge in the case of a proselyte to permit such a<br>
 relation. Perhaps the Corinthians had also learned how to split<br>
 hairs over moral matters in such an evil atmosphere and so to<br>
 condone this crime in one of their own members. Expulsion Paul<br>
 had urged in <!-#-->2Th 3:6 for such offenders.<br>
 <br>
 5:2 <B>{And ye are puffed up}</B> <b><i>(\kai humeis pephusi&#333;menoi este\)</i></b>.<br>
 Emphatic position of \humeis\ <b><i>(you)</i></b>. It may be understood as a<br>
 question. Perfect passive periphrastic indicative of the same<br>
 verb \phusio&#333;\ used already of the partisans in Corinth<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->4:6,19,20)</i></b>. Those of the same faction with this scoundrel<br>
 justified his rascality. <B>{Did not rather mourn}</B> <b><i>(\kai ouchi<br>
 mallon epenth&#275;sate\)</i></b>. Possibly question also and note strong<br>
 negative form \ouchi\, which favours it. The very least that they<br>
 could have done <b><i>(\mallon\ rather than be puffed up)</i></b> was to mourn<br>
 for shame <b><i>(\penthe&#333;\, old verb for lamentation)</i></b> as if for one<br>
 dead. <B>{That he might be taken away}</B> <b><i>(\hina arth&#275;i\)</i></b>. The<br>
 sub-final use of \hina\ of desired result <b><i>(<!-#-->1:15)</i></b> so common in<br>
 the _Koin&#275;_. First aorist passive subjunctive of \air&#333;\, to lift<br>
 up, to carry off. Decent self-respect should have compelled the<br>
 instant expulsion of the man instead of pride in his rascality.<br>
 <br>
 5:3 <B>{For I verily}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; men gar\)</i></b>. Emphatic statement of Paul's<br>
 own attitude of indignation, \eg&#333;\ in contrast with \humeis\. He<br>
 justifies his demand for the expulsion of the man. <B>{Being absent}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ap&#333;n\)</i></b> Although absent <b><i>(concessive participle)</i></b> and so of<br>
 \par&#333;n\ though present. Each with locative case <b><i>(\t&#333;i s&#333;mati, t&#333;i<br>
 pneumati\)</i></b>. <B>{Have already judged}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;d&#275; kekrika\)</i></b>. Perfect active<br>
 indicative of \krin&#333;\. I have already decided or judged, as<br>
 though present <b><i>(\h&#333;s par&#333;n\)</i></b>. Paul felt compelled to reach a<br>
 conclusion about the case and in a sentence of much difficulty<br>
 seems to conceive an imaginary church court where the culprit has<br>
 been tried and condemned. There are various ways of punctuating<br>
 the clauses in this sentence in verses <!-#-->3-5. It is not merely<br>
 Paul's individual judgment. The genitive absolute clause in verse<br>
 <!-#-->4, <B>{ye being gathered together}</B> <b><i>(\sunachthent&#333;n hum&#333;n\, first<br>
 aorist passive participle of \sunag&#333;\, in regular assembly)</i></b> <B>{and<br>
 my spirit}</B> <b><i>(\kai tou emou pneumatos\)</i></b> with the assembly <b><i>(he<br>
 means)</i></b> <B>{and meeting in the name of our Lord Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i<br>
 onomati tou Kuriou [h&#275;m&#333;n] I&#275;sou\)</i></b> with the power of the Lord<br>
 Jesus <b><i>(\sun t&#275;i dunamei tou Kuriou h&#275;m&#333;n I&#275;sou\)</i></b>, though this<br>
 clause can be taken with the infinitive to deliver<br>
 <b><i>(\paradounai\)</i></b>. It makes good syntax and sense taken either way.<br>
 The chief difference is that, if taken with "gathered together"<br>
 <b><i>(\sunachthent&#333;n\)</i></b> Paul assumes less apostolic prerogative to<br>
 himself. But he did have such power and used it against Elymas<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 13:8ff.)</i></b> as Peter did against Ananias and Sapphira <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 5:1ff.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:5 <B>{To deliver such an one unto Satan}</B> <b><i>(\paradounai ton toiouton<br>
 t&#333;i Satan&#257;i\)</i></b>. We have the same idiom in <!-#-->1Ti 1:20 used of<br>
 Hymenius and Alexander. In <!-#-->2Co 12:7 Paul speaks of his own<br>
 physical suffering as a messenger <b><i>(\aggelos\)</i></b> of Satan. Paul<br>
 certainly means expulsion from the church <b><i>(verse <!-#-->2)</i></b> and<br>
 regarding him as outside of the commonwealth of Israel <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph<br>
 2:11f.)</i></b>. But we are not to infer that expulsion from the local<br>
 church means the damnation of the offender. The wilful offenders<br>
 have to be expelled and not regarded as enemies, but admonished<br>
 as brothers <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 3:14f.)</i></b>. <B>{For the destruction of the flesh}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eis olethron t&#275;s sarkos\)</i></b>. Both for physical suffering as in<br>
 the case of Job <b><i>(<!-#-->Job 2:6)</i></b> and for conquest of the fleshly sins,<br>
 remedial punishment. <B>{That the spirit may be saved}</B> <b><i>(\hina to<br>
 pneuma s&#333;th&#275;i\)</i></b>. The ultimate purpose of the expulsion as<br>
 discipline. Note the use of \to pneuma\ in contrast with \sarx\<br>
 as the seat of personality <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->3:15)</i></b>. Paul's motive is not<br>
 merely vindictive, but the reformation of the offender who is not<br>
 named here nor in <!-#-->2Co 2:5-11 if the same man is meant, which is<br>
 very doubtful. The final salvation of the man in the day of<br>
 Christ is the goal and this is to be attained not by condoning<br>
 his sin.<br>
 <br>
 5:6 <B>{Not good}</B> <b><i>(\ou kalon\)</i></b>. Not beautiful, not seemly, in view<br>
 of this plague spot, this cancer on the church. They needed a<br>
 surgical operation at once instead of boasting and pride <b><i>(puffed<br>
 up)</i></b>. \Kauch&#275;ma\ is the thing gloried in. <B>{A little leaven<br>
 leaveneth the whole lump}</B> <b><i>(\mikra zum&#275; holon to phurama zumoi\)</i></b>.<br>
 This proverb occurs _verbatim_ in <!-#-->Ga 5:9. \Zum&#275;\ <b><i>(leaven)</i></b> is a<br>
 late word from \ze&#333;\, to boil, as is \zumo&#333;\, to leaven. The<br>
 contraction is regular <b><i>(\-oei=oi\)</i></b> for the third person singular<br>
 present indicative. See the parables of Jesus for the pervasive<br>
 power of leaven <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 13:33)</i></b>. Some of the members may have argued<br>
 that one such case did not affect the church as a whole, a<br>
 specious excuse for negligence that Paul here answers. The<br>
 emphasis is on the "little" <b><i>(\mikra\, note position)</i></b>. Lump<br>
 <b><i>(\phurama\ from \phura&#333;\, to mix, late word, in the papyri mixing<br>
 a medical prescription)</i></b> is a substance mixed with water and<br>
 kneaded like dough. Compare the pervasive power of germs of<br>
 disease in the body as they spread through the body.<br>
 <br>
 5:7 <B>{Purge out}</B> <b><i>(\ekkatharate\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b> active<br>
 imperative of \ekkathair&#333;\, old verb to cleanse out <b><i>(\ek\)</i></b>, to<br>
 clean completely. Aorist tense of urgency, do it now and do it<br>
 effectively before the whole church is contaminated. This turn to<br>
 the metaphor is from the command to purge out the old <b><i>(\palaian\,<br>
 now old and decayed)</i></b> leaven before the passover feast <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex<br>
 12:15f.; 13:7; Zep 1:12)</i></b>. Cf. modern methods of disinfection<br>
 after a contagious disease. <B>{A new lump}</B> <b><i>(\neon phurama\)</i></b>. Make a<br>
 fresh start as a new community with the contamination removed.<br>
 \Neos\ is the root for \neaniskos\, a young man, not yet old<br>
 <b><i>(\g&#275;raios\)</i></b>. So new wine <b><i>(\oinon neon\ <!-#-->Mt 9:17)</i></b>. \Kainos\ is<br>
 fresh as compared with the ancient <b><i>(\palaios\)</i></b>. See the<br>
 distinction in <!-#-->Col 3:10; Eph 4:22ff.; 2Co 5:17. <B>{Unleavened}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\azumoi\)</i></b>. Without <b><i>(\a\ privative)</i></b> leaven, the normal and ideal<br>
 state of Christians. Rare word among the ancients <b><i>(once in<br>
 Plato)</i></b>. They are a new creation <b><i>(\kain&#275; ktisis\)</i></b>, "exemplifying<br>
 Kant's maxim that you should treat a man as if he were what you<br>
 would wish him to be" <b><i>(Robertson and Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{For our passover<br>
 also hath been sacrificed, even Christ}</B> <b><i>(\kai gar to pascha h&#275;m&#333;n<br>
 etuth&#275; Christos\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of \thu&#333;\, old<br>
 verb to sacrifice. Euphony of consonants, \th\ to \t\ because of<br>
 \-th&#275;\. Reference to the death of Christ on the Cross as the<br>
 Paschal Lamb <b><i>(common use of \pascha\ as <!-#-->Mr 14:12; Lu 22:7)</i></b>, the<br>
 figure used long before by the Baptist of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:29)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul means that the Lamb was already slain on Calvary and yet you<br>
 have not gotten rid of the leaven.<br>
 <br>
 5:8 <B>{Wherefore let us keep the feast}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste heortaz&#333;men\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present active subjunctive <b><i>(volitive)</i></b>. Let us keep on keeping the<br>
 feast, a perpetual feast <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>, and keep the leaven out. It<br>
 is quite possible that Paul was writing about the time of the<br>
 Jewish passover, since it was before pentecost <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 16:8)</i></b>. But,<br>
 if so, that is merely incidental, and his language here is not a<br>
 plea for the observance of Easter by Christians. <B>{With the leaven<br>
 of malice and wickedness}</B> <b><i>(\en zum&#275;i kakias kai pon&#275;rias\)</i></b>.<br>
 Vicious disposition and evil deed. <B>{With the unleavened bread of<br>
 sincerity and truth}</B> <b><i>(\en azumois eilikrinias kai al&#275;theias\)</i></b>. No<br>
 word for "bread." The plural of \azumois\ may suggest "elements"<br>
 or "loaves." \Eilikrinia\ <b><i>(sincerity)</i></b> does not occur in the<br>
 ancient Greek and is rare in the later Greek. In the papyri it<br>
 means probity in one example. The etymology is uncertain. Boisacq<br>
 inclines to the notion of \heil&#275;\ or \hel&#275;\, sunlight, and<br>
 \krin&#333;\, to judge by the light of the sun, holding up to the<br>
 light. \Al&#275;theia\ <b><i>(truth)</i></b> is a common word from \al&#275;th&#275;s\ <b><i>(true)</i></b><br>
 and this from \a\ privative and \l&#275;th&#333;\ <b><i>(\lathein, lanthan&#333;\, to<br>
 conceal or hide)</i></b> and so unconcealed, not hidden. The Greek idea<br>
 of truth is out in the open. Note <!-#-->Ro 1:18 where Paul pictures<br>
 those who are holding down the truth in unrighteousness.<br>
 <br>
 5:9 <B>{I wrote unto you in my epistle}</B> <b><i>(\egrapsa humin en t&#275;i<br>
 epistol&#275;i\)</i></b>. Not the epistolary aorist, but a reference to an<br>
 epistle to the Corinthians earlier than this one <b><i>(our First<br>
 Corinthians)</i></b>, one not preserved to us. What a "find" it would be<br>
 if a bundle of papyri in Egypt should give it back to us? <B>{To<br>
 have no company with fornicators}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; sunanamignusthai<br>
 pornois\)</i></b>. Present middle infinitive with \m&#275;\ in an indirect<br>
 command of a late double compound verb used in the papyri to mix<br>
 up with <b><i>(\sun-ana-mignusthai\, a \mi\ verb)</i></b>. It is in the N.T.<br>
 only here and verse <!-#-->11; 2Th 3:14 which see. It is used here<br>
 with the associative instrumental case <b><i>(\pornois\, from \pera&#333;,<br>
 pern&#275;mi\, to sell, men and women who sell their bodies for lust)</i></b>.<br>
 It is a pertinent question today how far modern views try to put<br>
 a veneer over the vice in men and women.<br>
 <br>
 5:10 <B>{Not altogether}</B> <b><i>(\ou pant&#333;s\)</i></b>. Not absolutely, not in all<br>
 circumstances. Paul thus puts a limitation on his prohibition and<br>
 confines it to members of the church. He has no jurisdiction over<br>
 the outsiders <b><i>(this world, \tou kosmou toutou\)</i></b>. <B>{The covetous}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\tois pleonektais\)</i></b>. Old word for the over-reachers, those<br>
 avaricious for more and more <b><i>(\pleon, ech&#333;\, to have more)</i></b>. In<br>
 N.T. only here, <!-#-->6:10; Eph 5:5. It always comes in bad company<br>
 <b><i>(the licentious and the idolaters)</i></b> like the modern gangsters who<br>
 form a combination of liquor, lewdness, lawlessness for money and<br>
 power. <B>{Extortioners}</B> <b><i>(\harpaxin\)</i></b>. An old adjective with only<br>
 one gender, rapacious <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 7:15; Lu 18:11)</i></b>, and as a substantive<br>
 robber or extortioner <b><i>(here and <!-#-->6:10)</i></b>. Bandits, hijackers,<br>
 grafters they would be called today. <B>{Idolaters}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eid&#333;lolatrais\)</i></b>. Late word for hirelings <b><i>(\latris\)</i></b> of the<br>
 idols <b><i>(\eid&#333;lon\)</i></b>, so our very word idolater. See <!-#-->6:9; 10:7; Eph<br>
 5:5; Re 21:8; 22:15. Nageli regards this word as a Christian<br>
 formation. <B>{For then must ye needs}</B> <b><i>(\epei &#333;pheilete oun\)</i></b>. This<br>
 neat Greek idiom of \epei\ with the imperfect indicative<br>
 <b><i>(\&#333;pheilete\, from \opheil&#333;\, to be under obligation)</i></b> is really<br>
 the conclusion of a second-class condition with the condition<br>
 unexpressed <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 965)</i></b>. Sometimes \an\ is<br>
 used also as in <!-#-->Heb 10:2, but with verbs of obligation or<br>
 necessity \an\ is usually absent as here <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Heb 9:20)</i></b>. The<br>
 unexpressed condition here would be, "if that were true"<br>
 <b><i>(including fornicators, the covetous, extortioners, idolaters of<br>
 the outside world)</i></b>. \Ara\ means in that case.<br>
 <br>
 5:11 <B>{But now I write unto you}</B> <b><i>(\nun de egrapsa humin\)</i></b>. This is<br>
 the epistolary aorist referring to this same epistle and not to a<br>
 previous one as in verse <!-#-->9. As it is <b><i>(when you read it)</i></b> I did<br>
 write unto you. <B>{If any man that is named a brother be}</B> <b><i>(\ean tis<br>
 adelphos onomazomenos &#275;i\)</i></b>. Condition of the third class, a<br>
 supposable case. <B>{Or a reviler or a drunkard}</B> <b><i>(\&#275; loidoros &#275;<br>
 methusos\)</i></b>. \Loidoros\ occurs in Euripides as an adjective and in<br>
 later writings. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->6:10. For the verb see<br>
 <!-#-->1Co 4:12. \Methusos\ is an old Greek word for women and even<br>
 men <b><i>(cf. \paroinos\, of men, <!-#-->1Ti 3:3)</i></b>. In N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->6:10. Cf. <!-#-->Ro 13:13. Deissmann <b><i>(_Light from the Ancient East_,<br>
 p. 316)</i></b> gives a list of virtues and vices on counters for Roman<br>
 games that correspond remarkably with Paul's list of vices here<br>
 and in <!-#-->6:10. Chrysostom noted that people in his day complained<br>
 of the bad company given by Paul for revilers and drunkards as<br>
 being men with more "respectable" vices! <B>{With such a one, no,<br>
 not to eat}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i toiout&#333;i m&#275;de sunesthiein\)</i></b>. Associative<br>
 instrumental case of \toiout&#333;i\ after \sunesthiein\, "not even to<br>
 eat with such a one." Social contacts with such "a brother" are<br>
 forbidden<br>
 <br>
 5:12 <B>{For what have I to do?}</B> <b><i>(\ti gar moi;\)</i></b>. "For what is it to<br>
 me <b><i>(dative)</i></b> to judge those without <b><i>(\tous exo\)</i></b>?" They are<br>
 outside the church and not within Paul's jurisdiction. God passes<br>
 judgment on them.<br>
 <br>
 5:13 <B>{Put away the wicked man}</B> <b><i>(\exarate ton pon&#275;ron\)</i></b>. By this<br>
 quotation from <!-#-->De 17:7 Paul clinches the case for the expulsion<br>
 of the offender <b><i>(<!-#-->5:2)</i></b>. Note \ex\ twice and effective aorist<br>
 tense.<br>
