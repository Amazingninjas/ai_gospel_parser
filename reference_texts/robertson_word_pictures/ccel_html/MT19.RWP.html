<p>19:1 <B>{He departed}</B> <b><i>(\met&#275;ren\)</i></b>. Literally, to lift up, change<br>
 something to another place. Transitive in the LXX and in a<br>
 Cilician rock inscription. Intransitive in <!-#-->13:53 and here, the<br>
 only N.T. instances. Absence of \hoti\ or \kai\ after \kai<br>
 egeneto\, one of the clear Hebraisms in the N.T. <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, pp. 1042f.)</i></b>. This verse is a sort of formula in<br>
 Matthew at the close of important groups of \logia\ as in <!-#-->7:28;<br>
 11:1; 13:53. <B>{The borders of Judea beyond Jordan}</B> <b><i>(\eis ta horia<br>
 t&#275;s Ioudaias peran tou Iordanou\)</i></b>. This is a curious expression.<br>
 It apparently means that Jesus left Galilee to go to Judea by way<br>
 of Perea as the Galileans often did to avoid Samaria. Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 17:11)</i></b> expressly says that he passed through Samaria and Galilee<br>
 when he left Ephraim in Northern Judea <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 11:54)</i></b>. He was not<br>
 afraid to pass through the edge of Galilee and down the Jordan<br>
 Valley in Perea on this last journey to Jerusalem. McNeile is<br>
 needlessly opposed to the trans-Jordanic or Perean aspect of this<br>
 phase of Christ's work.<br>
 <br>
 19:3 <B>{Pharisees tempting him}</B> <b><i>(\Pharisaioi peirazontes auton\)</i></b>.<br>
 They "could not ask a question of Jesus without sinister motives"<br>
 <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. See <!-#-->4:1 for the word <b><i>(\peiraz&#333;\)</i></b>. <B>{For every cause}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kata pasan aitian\)</i></b>. This clause is an allusion to the dispute<br>
 between the two theological schools over the meaning of <!-#-->De<br>
 24:1. The school of Shammai took the strict and unpopular view<br>
 of divorce for unchastity alone while the school of Hillel took<br>
 the liberal and popular view of easy divorce for any passing whim<br>
 if the husband saw a prettier woman <b><i>(modern enough surely)</i></b> or<br>
 burnt his biscuits for breakfast. It was a pretty dilemma and<br>
 meant to do Jesus harm with the people. There is no real trouble<br>
 about the use of \kata\ here in the sense of \propter\ or because<br>
 of <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 509)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 19:5 <B>{Shall cleave}</B> <b><i>(\koll&#275;th&#275;setai\)</i></b>. First future passive,<br>
 "shall be glued to," the verb means. <B>{The twain shall become one<br>
 flesh}</B> <b><i>(\esontai hoi duo eis sarka mian\)</i></b>. This use of \eis\<br>
 after \eimi\ is an imitation of the Hebrew, though a few examples<br>
 occur in the older Greek and in the papyri. The frequency of it<br>
 is due to the Hebrew and here the LXX is a direct translation of<br>
 the Hebrew idiom.<br>
 <br>
 19:6 <B>{What therefore God hath joined together}</B> <b><i>(\ho oun ho theos<br>
 sunezeuxen\)</i></b>. Note "what," not "whom." The marriage relation God<br>
 has made. "The creation of sex, and the high doctrine as to the<br>
 cohesion it produces between man and woman, laid down in Gen.,<br>
 interdict separation" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. The word for "joined together"<br>
 means "yoked together," a common verb for marriage in ancient<br>
 Greek. It is the timeless aorist indicative <b><i>(\sunezeuxen\)</i></b>, true<br>
 always. <B>{Bill}</B> <b><i>(\biblion\)</i></b>. A little \biblos\ <b><i>(see on &#175;1:1)</i></b>, a<br>
 scroll or document <b><i>(papyrus or parchment)</i></b>. This was some<br>
 protection to the divorced wife and a restriction on laxity.<br>
 <br>
 19:8 <B>{For your hardness of heart}</B> <b><i>(\pros t&#275;n skl&#275;rokardian<br>
 h&#8211;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. The word is apparently one of the few Biblical words<br>
 <b><i>(LXX and the N.T.)</i></b>. It is a heart dried up <b><i>(\skl&#275;ros\)</i></b>, hard and<br>
 tough. <B>{But from the beginning it hath not been so}</B> <b><i>(\ap' arch&#275;s<br>
 de ouk gegonen hout&#333;s\)</i></b>. The present perfect active of \ginomai\<br>
 to emphasize the permanence of the divine ideal. "The original<br>
 ordinance has never been abrogated nor superseded, but continues<br>
 in force" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. "How small the Pharisaic disputants must<br>
 have felt in presence of such holy teaching, which soars above<br>
 the partisan view of controversialists into the serene region of<br>
 ideal, universal, eternal truth" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 19:9 <B>{Except for fornication}</B> <b><i>(\parektos logou porneias\)</i></b>. This<br>
 is the marginal reading in Westcott and Hort which also adds<br>
 "maketh her an adulteress" <b><i>(\poiei aut&#275;n moicheuth&#275;nai\)</i></b> and also<br>
 these words: "and he that marrieth her when she is put away<br>
 committeth adultery" <b><i>(\kai ho apolelumen&#275;n gam&#275;sas moichatai\)</i></b>.<br>
 There seems to be a certain amount of assimilation in various<br>
 manuscripts between this verse and the words in <!-#-->5:32. But,<br>
 whatever reading is accepted here, even the short one in Westcott<br>
 and Hort <b><i>(\m&#275; epi pornei&#257;i\, not for fornication)</i></b>, it is plain<br>
 that Matthew represents Jesus in both places as allowing divorce<br>
 for fornication as a general term <b><i>(\porneia\)</i></b> which is<br>
 technically adultery <b><i>(\moicheia\ from \moicha&#333; or moicheu&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 Here, as in <!-#-->5:31f., a group of scholars deny the genuineness of<br>
 the exception given by Matthew alone. McNeile holds that "the<br>
 addition of the saving clause is, in fact, opposed to the spirit<br>
 of the whole context, and must have been made at a time when the<br>
 practice of divorce for adultery had already grown up." That in<br>
 my opinion is gratuitous criticism which is unwilling to accept<br>
 Matthew's report because it disagrees with one's views on the<br>
 subject of divorce. He adds: "It cannot be supposed that Matthew<br>
 wished to represent Jesus as siding with the school of Shammai."<br>
 Why not, if Shammai on this point agreed with Jesus? Those who<br>
 deny Matthew's report are those who are opposed to remarriage at<br>
 all. Jesus by implication, as in <!-#-->5:31, does allow remarriage of<br>
 the innocent party, but not of the guilty one. Certainly Jesus<br>
 has lifted the whole subject of marriage and divorce to a new<br>
 level, far beyond the petty contentions of the schools of Hillel<br>
 and Shammai.<br>
 <br>
 19:10 <B>{The disciples say unto him}</B> <b><i>(\legousin aut&#333;i hoi<br>
 math&#275;tai\)</i></b>. "Christ's doctrine on marriage not only separated Him<br>
 \toto caelo\ from Pharisaic opinions of all shades, but was too<br>
 high even for the Twelve" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. <B>{The case}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; aitia\)</i></b>. The<br>
 word may refer to the use in verse <!-#-->3 "for every cause." It may<br>
 have a vague idea here = \res\, condition. But the point clearly<br>
 is that "it is not expedient to marry" <b><i>(\ou sumpherei gam&#275;sai\)</i></b><br>
 if such a strict view is held. If the bond is so tight a man had<br>
 best not commit matrimony. It is a bit unusual to have<br>
 \anthr&#333;pos\ and \gun&#275;\ contrasted rather than \an&#275;r\ and \gun&#275;\.<br>
 <br>
 19:11 <B>{But they to whom it is given}</B> <b><i>(\all' hois dedotai\)</i></b>. A<br>
 neat Greek idiom, dative case of relation and perfect passive<br>
 indicative. The same idea is repeated at the close of verse <!-#-->12.<br>
 It is a voluntary renunciation of marriage for the sake of the<br>
 kingdom of heaven. "Jesus recognizes the severity of the demand<br>
 as going beyond the capacity of all but a select number." It was<br>
 a direct appeal to the spiritual intelligence of the disciples<br>
 not to misconceive his meaning as certainly the monastic orders<br>
 have done.<br>
 <br>
 19:13 <B>{Rebuked them}</B> <b><i>(\epetim&#275;sen autois\)</i></b>. No doubt people did<br>
 often crowd around Jesus for a touch of his hand and his<br>
 blessing. The disciples probably felt that they were doing Jesus<br>
 a kindness. How little they understood children and Jesus. It is<br>
 a tragedy to make children feel that they are in the way at home<br>
 and at church. These men were the twelve apostles and yet had no<br>
 vision of Christ's love for little children. The new child world<br>
 of today is due directly to Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 19:14 <B>{Suffer}</B> <b><i>(\aphete\)</i></b>. "Leave them alone." Second aorist<br>
 active imperative. <B>{Forbid them not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; k&#333;luete\)</i></b>. "Stop<br>
 hindering them." The idiom of \m&#275;\ with the present imperative<br>
 means just that. <B>{Of such}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n toiout&#333;n\)</i></b>. The childlike as in<br>
 <!-#-->18:3f.<br>
 <br>
 19:16 <B>{What good thing}</B> <b><i>(\ti agathon\)</i></b>. Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 10:17)</i></b> has the<br>
 adjective "good" with "Teacher." <B>{May have}</B> <b><i>(\sch&#333;\)</i></b>. Ingressive<br>
 aorist subjunctive, "may get," "may acquire."<br>
 <br>
 19:17 <B>{Concerning that which is good}</B> <b><i>(\peri tou agathou\)</i></b>. He<br>
 had asked Jesus in verse <!-#-->16 "what good thing" he should do. He<br>
 evidently had a light idea of the meaning of \agathos\. "This was<br>
 only a teacher's way of leading on a pupil" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. So Jesus<br>
 explains that "One there is who is good," one alone who is really<br>
 good in the absolute sense.<br>
 <br>
 19:20 <B>{What lack I yet?}</B> <b><i>(\ti eti huster&#333;?\)</i></b> Here is a<br>
 psychological paradox. He claims to have kept all these<br>
 commandments and yet he was not satisfied. He had an uneasy<br>
 conscience and Jesus called him to something that he did not<br>
 have. He thought of goodness as quantitative <b><i>(a series of acts)</i></b><br>
 and not qualitative <b><i>(of the nature of God)</i></b>. Did his question<br>
 reveal proud complacency or pathetic despair? A bit of both most<br>
 likely.<br>
 <br>
 19:21 <B>{If thou wouldest be perfect}</B> <b><i>(\ei theleis teleios einai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Condition of the first class, determined as fulfilled. Jesus<br>
 assumes that the young man really desires to be perfect <b><i>(a big<br>
 adjective that, perfect as God is the goal, <!-#-->5:48)</i></b>. <B>{That thou<br>
 hast}</B> <b><i>(\sou ta huparchonta\)</i></b>. "Thy belongings." The Greek neuter<br>
 plural participle used like our English word "belongings." It was<br>
 a huge demand, for he was rich.<br>
 <br>
 19:22 <B>{Went away sorrowful}</B> <b><i>(\ap&#275;lthen lupoumenos\)</i></b>. "Went away<br>
 grieved." He felt that Jesus had asked too much of him. He<br>
 worshipped money more than God when put to the test. Does Jesus<br>
 demand this same test of every one? Not unless he is in the grip<br>
 of money. Different persons are in the power of different sins.<br>
 One sin is enough to keep one away from Christ.<br>
 <br>
 19:23 <B>{It is hard}</B> <b><i>(\duskol&#333;s\)</i></b>. With difficulty. Adverb from<br>
 \duskolos\, hard to find food, fastidious, faultfinding, then<br>
 difficult.<br>
 <br>
 19:24 <B>{It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eukop&#333;teron estin kam&#275;lon dia tr&#275;matos rhaphidos eiselthein\)</i></b>.<br>
 Jesus, of course, means by this comparison, whether an eastern<br>
 proverb or not, to express the impossible. The efforts to explain<br>
 it away are jejune like a ship's cable, \kamilon\ or \rhaphis\ as<br>
 a narrow gorge or gate of entrance for camels which recognized<br>
 stooping, etc. All these are hopeless, for Jesus pointedly calls<br>
 the thing "impossible" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->26)</i></b>. The Jews in the Babylonian<br>
 Talmud did have a proverb that a man even in his dreams did not<br>
 see an elephant pass through the eye of a needle <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. The<br>
 Koran speaks of the wicked finding the gates of heaven shut "till<br>
 a camel shall pass through the eye of a needle." But the Koran<br>
 may have got this figure from the New Testament. The word for an<br>
 ordinary needle is \rhaphis\, but, Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 18:25)</i></b> employs<br>
 \belon&#275;\, the medical term for the surgical needle not elsewhere<br>
 in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 19:25 <B>{Were astonished}</B> <b><i>(\exepl&#275;ssonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect descriptive<br>
 of their blank amazement. They were literally "struck out."<br>
 <br>
 19:26 <B>{Looking on them}</B> <b><i>(\emblepsas\)</i></b>. Jesus saw their amazement.<br>
 <br>
 19:27 <B>{What then shall we have?}</B> <b><i>(\ti ara estai h&#275;min?\)</i></b> A<br>
 pathetic question of hopeless lack of comprehension.<br>
 <br>
 19:28 <B>{In the regeneration}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i palingenesi&#257;i\)</i></b>. The new<br>
 birth of the world is to be fulfilled when Jesus sits on his<br>
 throne of glory. This word was used by the Stoics and the<br>
 Pythagoreans. It is common also in the mystery religions <b><i>(Angus,<br>
 _Mystery Religions and Christianity_, pp. 95ff.)</i></b>. It is in the<br>
 papyri also. We must put no fantastic ideas into the mouth of<br>
 Jesus. But he did look for the final consummation of his kingdom.<br>
 What is meant by the disciples also sitting on twelve thrones is<br>
 not clear.<br>
 <br>
 19:29 <B>{A hundredfold}</B> <b><i>(\hekatonplasiona\)</i></b>. But Westcott and Hort<br>
 read \pollaplasiona\, manifold. Eternal life is the real reward.<br>
 <br>
 19:30 <B>{The last first and the first last}</B> <b><i>(\hoi eschatoi pr&#333;toi<br>
 kai hoi pr&#333;toi eschatoi\)</i></b>. This paradoxical enigma is probably in<br>
 the nature of a rebuke to Peter and refers to ranks in the<br>
 kingdom. There are many other possible applications. The<br>
 following parable illustrates it.<br>
