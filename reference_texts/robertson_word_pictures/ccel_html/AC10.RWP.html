<p>10:1 <B>{Cornelius}</B> <b><i>(\Korn&#275;lios\)</i></b>. The great Cornelian family of<br>
 Rome may have had a freedman or descendant who is <B>{centurion}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hekaton-tarch&#275;s\, leader of a hundred, Latin _centurio_)</i></b>. See<br>
 on &#175;Mt 8:5. These Roman centurions always appear in a favourable<br>
 light in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 8:5; Lu 7:2; 23:47; Ac 10:1; 22:25;<br>
 27:3)</i></b>. Furneaux notes the contrasts between Joppa, the oldest<br>
 town in Palestine, and Caesarea, built by Herod; the Galilean<br>
 fisherman lodging with a tanner and the Roman officer in the seat<br>
 of governmental authority. <B>{Of the band called the Italian}</B> <b><i>(\ek<br>
 speir&#275;s t&#275;s kaloumen&#275;s Italik&#275;s\)</i></b>. A legion had ten cohorts or<br>
 "bands" and sixty centuries. The word \speir&#275;s\ <b><i>(note genitive in<br>
 \-es\ like the Ionic instead of \-as\)</i></b> is here equal to the Latin<br>
 _cohors_. In the provinces were stationed cohorts of Italic<br>
 citizens <b><i>(volunteers)</i></b> as an inscription at Carnuntum on the<br>
 Danube <b><i>(Ramsay)</i></b> has shown <b><i>(epitaph of an officer in the second<br>
 Italic cohort)</i></b>. Once more Luke has been vindicated. The soldiers<br>
 could, of course, be Roman citizens who lived in Caesarea. But<br>
 the Italian cohorts were sent to any part of the empire as<br>
 needed. The procurator at Caesarea would need a cohort whose<br>
 loyalty he could trust, for the Jews were restless.<br>
 <br>
 10:2 <B>{Devout}</B> <b><i>(\euseb&#275;s\)</i></b>. Old word from \eu\ <b><i>(well)</i></b> and<br>
 \sebomai\ <b><i>(to worship, to reverence)</i></b>, but rare in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 10:2,7; 2Pe 2:1)</i></b>. It might refer to a worshipful pagan <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 17:23, \sebasmata\, objects of worship)</i></b>, but connected with "one<br>
 that feared God" <b><i>(\phoboumenos ton theon\)</i></b> Luke describes "a<br>
 God-fearing proselyte" as in <!-#-->10:22,35. This is his usual term<br>
 for the Gentile seekers after God <b><i>(<!-#-->13:16, 26;17:4,17, etc.)</i></b>,<br>
 who had come into the worship of the synagogue without<br>
 circumcision, and were not strictly proselytes, though some call<br>
 such men "proselytes of the gate" <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ac 13:43)</i></b>; but clearly<br>
 Cornelius and his family were still regarded as outside the pale<br>
 of Judaism <b><i>(<!-#-->10:28,34; 11:1,8; 15:7)</i></b>. They had seats in the<br>
 synagogue, but were not Jews. <B>{Gave much alms}</B> <b><i>(\poi&#333;n<br>
 eleemosunas pollas\)</i></b>. Doing many alms <b><i>(the very phrase in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 6:2)</i></b>, a characteristic mark of Jewish piety and from a Gentile<br>
 to the Jewish people. <B>{Prayed}</B> <b><i>(\deomenos\)</i></b>. Begging of God.<br>
 Almsgiving and prayer were two of the cardinal points with the<br>
 Jews <b><i>(Jesus adds fasting in his picture of the Pharisee in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 6:1-18)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:3 <B>{Coming in}</B> <b><i>(\eiselthonta\)</i></b>. Ingressive second aorist active<br>
 participle, not present. So punctiliar, "saw come," not "saw<br>
 coming." So also "say" or "speak," not "saying." Luke repeats the<br>
 account of this vision to Cornelius twice <b><i>(<!-#-->10:30; 11:13)</i></b> and<br>
 also the story of the vision to Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->10:1-16,28; 11:5)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:4 <B>{Lord}</B> <b><i>(\kurie\)</i></b>. Cornelius recognizes the angel of God<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->3)</i></b> as God's messenger. <B>{Are gone up}</B> <b><i>(\aneb&#275;san\)</i></b>.<br>
 Timeless second aorist active indicative of \anabain&#333;\. Gone up<br>
 like the smoke of incense in sacrifices. <B>{For a memorial}</B> <b><i>(\eis<br>
 mn&#275;mosunon\)</i></b>. Old word from \mn&#275;m&#333;n\. The only other instance in<br>
 the N.T. is by Jesus about the act of Mary of Bethany <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 26:13;<br>
 Mr 14:9)</i></b>. His prayers and his alms proved his sincerity and won<br>
 the ear of God.<br>
 <br>
 10:5 <B>{Fetch}</B> <b><i>(\metapempsai\)</i></b>. First aorist middle <b><i>(indirect, for<br>
 one's self)</i></b> imperative of \metapemp&#333;\, usual voice in ancient<br>
 Greek with this verb in sense of sending another for one's own<br>
 sake. Only in Acts in the N.T. See also <!-#-->10:22.<br>
 <br>
 10:6 <B>{Lodgeth}</B> <b><i>(\xenizetai\)</i></b>. Present passive indicative of<br>
 \xeniz&#333;\ old verb from \xenos\, a stranger as a guest. So to<br>
 entertain a guest as here or to surprise by strange acts <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 17:20; 1Pe 4:4)</i></b>. <B>{Whose}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;i\)</i></b>. To whom, dative of possession.<br>
 <B>{By the seaside}</B> <b><i>(\para thalassan\)</i></b>. Along by the sea. Note<br>
 accusative case. Outside the city walls because a tanner and to<br>
 secure water for his trade. Some tanneries are by the seashore at<br>
 Jaffa today.<br>
 <br>
 10:8 <B>{Rehearsed}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#275;g&#275;samenos\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Lu 24:35. All the<br>
 details about the vision. The soldier was "devout" like Cornelius<br>
 and would protect the two household servants <b><i>(\oiket&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:9 <B>{On the morrow}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i epaurion\)</i></b>. Locative case of article<br>
 with the compound adverb <b><i>(\h&#275;mer&#257;i\ day being understood)</i></b>, the<br>
 second day after leaving Caesarea, 28 miles from Joppa. The third<br>
 day <b><i>(the next morrow, verse <!-#-->23)</i></b> they start back home and the<br>
 fourth day <b><i>(on the morrow again, verse <!-#-->24)</i></b> they reach Caesarea.<br>
 <B>{As they}</B> <b><i>(\ekein&#333;n\)</i></b>. The party of three from Caesarea. Genitive<br>
 absolute with present participle \hodoiporount&#333;n\ <b><i>(journeying)</i></b><br>
 and \eggizont&#333;n\ <b><i>(drew nigh)</i></b>. <B>{The housetop}</B> <b><i>(\to d&#333;ma\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 word and in Gospels <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 3:19, etc.)</i></b>, but only here in Acts.<br>
 From \dem&#333;\, to build, and so any part of the building <b><i>(hall,<br>
 dining room, and then roof)</i></b>. The roof was nearly flat with walls<br>
 around and so was a good place for meditation and prayer and<br>
 naps.<br>
 <br>
 10:10 <B>{Hungry}</B> <b><i>(\prospeinos\)</i></b> Only instance of the word known, a<br>
 \hapax legomenon\. Probably "very hungry" <b><i>(\pros\=besides, in<br>
 addition)</i></b>. <B>{Desired}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;thelen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. Was longing<br>
 to eat. It was about twelve o'clock noon and Peter may even have<br>
 smelt the savory dishes, "while they made ready"<br>
 <b><i>(\paraskeuazont&#333;n\)</i></b>. "The natural and the supernatural border<br>
 closely on one another, with no definable limits" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. <B>{He<br>
 fell into a trance}</B> <b><i>(\egeneto ep' auton ekstasis\)</i></b>. More exactly,<br>
 "An ecstasy came upon him," in which trance he passed out of<br>
 himself <b><i>(\ekstasis\, from \exist&#275;mi\)</i></b> and from which one came to<br>
 himself <b><i>(<!-#-->12:11)</i></b>. Cf. also <!-#-->11:5; 22:17. It is thus different<br>
 from a vision <b><i>(\horama\)</i></b> as in verse <!-#-->3.<br>
 <br>
 10:11 <B>{Beholdeth}</B> <b><i>(\the&#333;rei\)</i></b>. Vivid historical present and<br>
 change from past time. <B>{Opened}</B> <b><i>(\ane&#333;igmenon\, perfect passive<br>
 participle with double reduplication, state of completion)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Descending}</B> <b><i>(\katabainon\)</i></b>. Present active participle describing<br>
 the process. <B>{Sheet}</B> <b><i>(\othon&#275;n\)</i></b>. Old word for linen cloth and<br>
 only here in the N.T. Accusative case in apposition with \skeuos\<br>
 <b><i>(vessel)</i></b>. <B>{Let down}</B> <b><i>(\Kathiemenon\)</i></b>. Present passive participle<br>
 of \Kathi&#275;mi\. Old verb, but in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 5:19;<br>
 Ac 9:25. Linear action here picturing the process, "being let<br>
 down." <B>{By four corners}</B> <b><i>(\tessarsin archais\)</i></b>. Instrumental case<br>
 of \arch&#275;\, beginning. We say "end" or extremity for this use of<br>
 the word. The picture is the sheet held up by four cords to which<br>
 the sheet is fastened. <!-#-->Isa 11:12 had said that Israel would be<br>
 gathered from the four corners of the earth. Knowling follows<br>
 Hobart in taking the four corners of the sheet to be a medical<br>
 phrase for bandage <b><i>(the end of a bandage)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:12 <B>{Were}</B> <b><i>(\hup&#275;rchen\)</i></b>. Imperfect of \huparch&#333;\ in sense of<br>
 \&#275;n\, to exist, be. Fish are not mentioned, perhaps because the<br>
 sheet had no water, though they were clean and unclean also <b><i>(<!-#-->Le<br>
 11:9; De 14:9)</i></b>. <B>{All manner of}</B> <b><i>(\panta\)</i></b>. Literally, all, but<br>
 clearly all varieties, not all individuals. Both clean and<br>
 unclean animals are in the sheet.<br>
 <br>
 10:14 <B>{Not so, Lord}</B> <b><i>(\M&#275;dam&#333;s, kurie\)</i></b>. The negative \m&#275;dam&#333;s\<br>
 calls for the optative \ei&#275;\ <b><i>(may it not be)</i></b> or the imperative<br>
 \est&#333;\ <b><i>(let it be)</i></b>. It is not \oudam&#333;s\, a blunt refusal <b><i>(I shall<br>
 not do it)</i></b>. And yet it is more than a mild protest as Page and<br>
 Furneaux argue. It is a polite refusal with a reason given. Peter<br>
 recognizes the invitation to slay <b><i>(\thuson\)</i></b> the unclean animals<br>
 as from the Lord <b><i>(\kurie\)</i></b> but declines it three times. <B>{For I<br>
 have never eaten anything}</B> <b><i>(\hoti oudepote ephagon pan\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active indicative, I never did anything like this and I<br>
 shall not do it now. The use of \pan\ <b><i>(everything)</i></b> with<br>
 \oudepote\ <b><i>(never)</i></b> is like the Hebrew <b><i>(_lo--k&#333;l_)</i></b> though a like<br>
 idiom appears in the vernacular _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 752)</i></b>. <B>{Common and unclean}</B> <b><i>(\koinon kai akatharton\)</i></b>. \Koinos\<br>
 from epic \xunos\ <b><i>(\xun, sun\, together with)</i></b> originally meant<br>
 common to several <b><i>(Latin _communis_)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Ac 2:44; 4:32; Tit<br>
 1:4; Jude 1:3. The use seen here <b><i>(also <!-#-->Mr 7:2,5; Ro 14:14; Heb<br>
 10:29; Re 21:27; Ac 10:28; 11:8)</i></b>, like Latin _vulgaris_ is<br>
 unknown in ancient Greek. Here the idea is made plain by the<br>
 addition of \akatharton\ <b><i>(unclean)</i></b>, ceremonially unclean, of<br>
 course. We have the same double use in our word "common." See on<br>
 &#175;Mr 7:18f. where Mark adds the remarkable participle<br>
 \kathariz&#333;n\ <b><i>(making all meats clean)</i></b>, evidently from Peter who<br>
 recalls this vision. Peter had been reared from childhood to make<br>
 the distinction between clean and unclean food and this new<br>
 proposal even from the Lord runs against all his previous<br>
 training. He did not see that some of God's plans for the Jews<br>
 could be temporary. This symbol of the sheet was to show Peter<br>
 ultimately that Gentiles could be saved without becoming Jews. At<br>
 this moment he is in spiritual and intellectual turmoil.<br>
 <br>
 10:15 <B>{Make not thou common}</B> <b><i>(\su m&#275; koinou\)</i></b>. Note emphatic<br>
 position of \su\ <b><i>(thou)</i></b>. Do thou stop making common what God<br>
 cleansed <b><i>(\ekatharisen\)</i></b>. The idiom of \m&#275;\ with the present<br>
 active imperative \koinou\ means precisely this. Peter had just<br>
 called "common" what God had invited him to slay and eat.<br>
 <br>
 10:16 <B>{Thrice}</B> <b><i>(\epitris\)</i></b>. For three times. Peter remained<br>
 unconvinced even by the prohibition of God. Here is a striking<br>
 illustration of obstinacy on the part of one who acknowledges the<br>
 voice of God to him when the command of the Lord crosses one's<br>
 preferences and prejudices. There are abundant examples today of<br>
 precisely this thing. In a real sense Peter was maintaining a<br>
 pose of piety beyond the will of the Lord. Peter was defiling<br>
 what God had cleansed. <B>{Was received up}</B> <b><i>(\anel&#275;mphth&#275;\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive indicative of \analamban&#333;\, to take up. The word<br>
 used of the Ascension <b><i>(<!-#-->1:22)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:17 <B>{Was much perplexed in himself}</B> <b><i>(\en heaut&#333;i di&#275;porei\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active of \diapore&#333;\, intensive compound <b><i>(\dia\,<br>
 thoroughly, and \a\ privative and \poros\, way)</i></b>, to be completely<br>
 at a loss to know what road to take. Old verb, but in N.T. only<br>
 in Luke and Acts. Page notes that Luke is singularly fond of<br>
 verbs compounded with \dia\. See on &#175;Lu 9:7 and <!-#-->Ac 2:12. When<br>
 out of the ecstasy he was more puzzled than ever. <B>{Might be}</B> <b><i>(\an<br>
 ei&#275;\)</i></b>. Optative with \an\ in indirect question simply retained<br>
 from the direct <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 1021, 1044)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ac<br>
 17:18, for the direct and <!-#-->Lu 1:62 for the indirect <b><i>(\an<br>
 theloi\ both times)</i></b>. It is the conclusion of a fourth class<br>
 condition. <B>{Having made inquiry}</B> <b><i>(\dier&#333;t&#275;santes\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active participle of \dier&#333;ta&#333;\, another compound of \dia\, to<br>
 ask one after another, to ask through, old verb, but only here in<br>
 the N.T. It took diligent inquiry to find the obscure house of<br>
 Simon the tanner. <B>{Stood before the gate}</B> <b><i>(\epest&#275;san epi ton<br>
 pul&#333;na\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative of \ephist&#275;mi\,<br>
 intransitive. Note repetition of \epi\. The messengers stopped<br>
 right at the folding gates of the passage <b><i>(\pul&#333;na\)</i></b> which led<br>
 from the street to the inner court or house.<br>
 <br>
 10:18 <B>{Called}</B> <b><i>(\ph&#333;n&#275;santes\)</i></b>. In a loud voice that those inside<br>
 the house might hear. <B>{Asked}</B> <b><i>(\epunthanonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle<br>
 of \punthanomai\, old verb to make inquiry especially with an<br>
 indirect question as here. Kept on inquiring. Westcott and Hort<br>
 follow B C here and read \eputhonto\ <b><i>(second aorist middle,<br>
 effective aorist)</i></b>. Either makes sense, though the imperfect is<br>
 more picturesque. <B>{Were lodging}</B> <b><i>(\xenizetai\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 indicative retained in indirect question. See on verse &#175;6 for<br>
 the verb.<br>
 <br>
 10:19 <B>{Thought}</B> <b><i>(\dienthumoumenou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute of present<br>
 middle participle of \dienthumeomai\, a double compound <b><i>(\dia\<br>
 and \en-\ with \thumos\)</i></b> and another \hapax legomenon\ save in<br>
 ecclesiastical writers, though \enthumeomai\ is common enough and<br>
 Textus Receptus so reads here. Peter was revolving in his mind,<br>
 through and through, in and out, to find the meaning of the<br>
 strange vision.<br>
 <br>
 10:20 <B>{But}</B> <b><i>(\alla\)</i></b>. So usually, though it is open to question<br>
 whether \alla\ is adversative here and not rather, "Now then."<br>
 <B>{Get thee down}</B> <b><i>(\katab&#275;thi\)</i></b>. Second aorist active imperative,<br>
 at once. <B>{Go}</B> <b><i>(\poreuou\)</i></b>. Present middle imperative, go on.<br>
 <B>{Nothing doubting}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;den diakrinomenos\)</i></b>. Another compound of<br>
 \dia\, old and common verb for a divided mind <b><i>(\dia\ like \duo\,<br>
 two)</i></b>. Note usual negative of the present middle participle, the<br>
 subjective \m&#275;den\. The notion of wavering <b><i>(<!-#-->Jas 1:6)</i></b> is common<br>
 with this verb in the middle voice. In <!-#-->Ac 11:12 the aorist<br>
 active <b><i>(\m&#275;den diakrinanta\)</i></b> is used perhaps with the idea of<br>
 conduct towards others rather than his own internal doubt as here<br>
 <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. <B>{For I}</B> <b><i>(\hoti eg&#333;\)</i></b>. The Holy Spirit assumes<br>
 responsibility for the messengers from Cornelius and thus<br>
 connects their mission with the vision which was still troubling<br>
 Peter. Peter had heard his name called by the man <b><i>(verse <!-#-->19)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:21 <B>{Cause}</B> <b><i>(\aitia\)</i></b>. Or reason. Common in this sense. See on<br>
 &#175;Mt 19:3.<br>
 <br>
 10:22 <B>{Righteous}</B> <b><i>(\dikaios\)</i></b>. In the Jewish sense as in <!-#-->Lu 1:6;<br>
 2:25. <B>{Well reported of}</B> <b><i>(\marturoumenos\)</i></b>. Present passive<br>
 participle as in <!-#-->6:3. Cf. the other centurion in <!-#-->Lu 7:4.<br>
 <B>{Nation}</B> <b><i>(\ethnous\)</i></b>. Not \laou\, for the speakers are Gentiles.<br>
 <B>{Was warned}</B> <b><i>(\echr&#275;matisth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive of<br>
 \chr&#275;matiz&#333;\, old word for doing business, then consulting an<br>
 oracle, and here of being divinely <b><i>(word God not expressed)</i></b><br>
 warned as in <!-#-->Mt 2:12,22; Lu 2:26; Heb 11:7. Then to be called<br>
 or receive a name from one's business as in <!-#-->Ac 11:26; Ro 7:3.<br>
 <br>
 10:23 <B>{Lodged them}</B> <b><i>(\exenisen\)</i></b>. Active voice here rather than<br>
 passive as in <!-#-->10:6. <B>{Accompanied him}</B> <b><i>(\sun&#275;lthan aut&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Associative instrumental case after verb. The wisdom of having<br>
 these half dozen Jewish Christians from Joppa with Peter in the<br>
 house of Cornelius in Caesarea becomes manifest in Jerusalem<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->11:12)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:24 <B>{Was waiting}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n prosdok&#333;n\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect<br>
 active, in eager expectation and hope, directing the mind<br>
 <b><i>(\doka&#333;\)</i></b> towards <b><i>(\pros\)</i></b> anything. Old and common verb. <B>{Near}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anagkaious\)</i></b>. Only instance in the N.T. of this sense of<br>
 \anagkaios\ from \anagk&#275;\, necessity, what one cannot do without,<br>
 necessary <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 12:22)</i></b>, duty <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 13:46)</i></b>, or blood relations as<br>
 here. The ancient Greek writers combined these two words<br>
 <b><i>(\suggeneis\, kinsmen, \anagkaious\, necessary friends)</i></b> as here.<br>
 It was a homogeneous group of Gentiles close to Cornelius and<br>
 predisposed to hear Peter favourably.<br>
 <br>
 10:25 <B>{That Peter entered}</B> <b><i>(\tou eiselthein ton Petron\)</i></b>. This is<br>
 a difficult construction, for the subject of \egeneto\ <b><i>(it<br>
 happened)</i></b> has to be the articular genitive infinitive \tou<br>
 eiselthein\ with the accusative of general reference \ton<br>
 Petron\. Most commentators consider it inexplicable. It is<br>
 probably an extension of the ordinary articular infinitive under<br>
 the influence of the Hebrew infinitive construct without regard<br>
 to the case, regarding it as a fixed case form and so using it as<br>
 nominative. Precisely this construction of \tou\ and the<br>
 infinitive as the subject of a verb occurs in the LXX <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ch 6:7,<br>
 etc.)</i></b>. See Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 1067f. for full discussion<br>
 of this obvious Hebraism. Somewhat similar examples appear in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 20:3; 27:1. But the Codex Bezae avoids this awkward idiom by the<br>
 genitive absolute <b><i>(\proseggizontos tou Petrou\)</i></b> and some<br>
 additional details <b><i>(one of the servants ran forward and announced<br>
 that he was come)</i></b>. <B>{Worshipped him}</B> <b><i>(\prosekun&#275;sen\)</i></b>. "Cornelius<br>
 was not an idolator and would not have honoured Peter as a god"<br>
 <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. The word probably means here reverence like old<br>
 English usage <b><i>(Wycliff)</i></b> and not actual worship, though Peter took<br>
 it that way <b><i>(verse <!-#-->26)</i></b>. Jesus accepted such worship <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 8:2;<br>
 Lu 5:8 by Peter)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:27 <B>{As he talked with him}</B> <b><i>(\sunomil&#333;n aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Present active<br>
 participle of \sunomile&#333;\, rare compound and here alone in the<br>
 N.T., with associative instrumental case. The uncompounded verb<br>
 is common enough though in the N.T. only in <!-#-->Lu 24:14 which see<br>
 and <!-#-->Ac 20:11; 24:26. <B>{Findeth}</B> <b><i>(\heuriskei\)</i></b>. Vivid historical<br>
 present indicative active. <B>{Come together}</B> <b><i>(\sunel&#275;luthotas\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second perfect active participle of \sunerchomai\. It was an<br>
 expectant group of Gentiles eager for Peter's interpretation of<br>
 the vision of Cornelius.<br>
 <br>
 10:28 <B>{How that it is an unlawful thing}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s athemiton estin\)</i></b>.<br>
 The conjunction \h&#333;s\ is sometimes equivalent to \hoti\ <b><i>(that)</i></b>.<br>
 The old form of \athemitos\ was \athemistos\ from \themisto\<br>
 <b><i>(\themiz&#333;, themis\, law custom)</i></b> and \a\ privative. In the N.T.<br>
 only here and <!-#-->1Pe 4:3 <b><i>(Peter both times)</i></b>. But there is no O.T.<br>
 regulation forbidding such social contact with Gentiles, though<br>
 the rabbis had added it and had made it binding by custom. There<br>
 is nothing more binding on the average person than social custom.<br>
 On coming from the market an orthodox Jew was expected to immerse<br>
 to avoid defilement <b><i>(Edersheim, _Jewish Social Life_, pp. 26-28;<br>
 Taylor's _Sayings of the Jewish Fathers_, pp. 15, 26, 137, second<br>
 edition)</i></b>. See also <!-#-->Ac 11:3; Ga 2:12. It is that middle wall of<br>
 partition between Jew and Gentile <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph 2:14)</i></b> which Jesus broke<br>
 down. <B>{One of another nation}</B> <b><i>(\allophul&#333;i\)</i></b>. Dative case of an<br>
 old adjective, but only here in the N.T. <b><i>(\allos\, another,<br>
 \phulon\, race)</i></b>. Both Juvenal <b><i>(_Sat_. XIV. 104, 105)</i></b> and Tacitus<br>
 <b><i>(_History_, V. 5)</i></b> speak of the Jewish exclusiveness and<br>
 separation from Gentiles. <B>{And yet unto}</B> <b><i>(\kamoi\)</i></b>. Dative of the<br>
 emphatic pronoun <b><i>(note position of prominence)</i></b> with \kai\<br>
 <b><i>(\crasis\)</i></b> meaning here "and yet" or adversative "but" as often<br>
 with \kai\ which is by no means always merely the connective<br>
 "and" <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 1182f.)</i></b>. Now Peter takes back<br>
 both the adjectives used in his protest to the Lord <b><i>(verse <!-#-->14)</i></b><br>
 "common and unclean." It is a long journey that Peter has made.<br>
 He here refers to "no one" <b><i>(\m&#275;dena\)</i></b>, not to "things," but that<br>
 is great progress.<br>
 <br>
 10:29 <B>{Without gainsaying}</B> <b><i>(\anantirrh&#275;t&#333;s\)</i></b>. \A\ privative with<br>
 compound adverb from \anti\ <b><i>(back, in return, against)</i></b> and verbal<br>
 \rh&#275;tos\ <b><i>(from \errh&#275;th&#275;n\, to speak)</i></b>. Late and rare and here<br>
 only in the N.T., but the adjective in <!-#-->19:36. Without answering<br>
 back. That is true after the Holy Spirit expressly told Peter to<br>
 go with the messengers of Cornelius <b><i>(<!-#-->10:19-23)</i></b>. Peter's<br>
 objections were made to the Lord in the vision which he did not<br>
 understand. But that vision prepared him for this great step<br>
 which he had now taken. He had stepped over the line of Jewish<br>
 custom. <B>{With what intent}</B> <b><i>(\tini log&#333;i\)</i></b>. More exactly, "for<br>
 what reason" as in Plato, _Gorgias_ 512 C.<br>
 <br>
 10:30 <B>{Four days ago}</B> <b><i>(\apo tetart&#275;s h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. From the fourth<br>
 day, reckoning backwards from this day. <B>{I was keeping the ninth<br>
 hour of prayer}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;m&#275;n t&#275;n enat&#275;n proseuchomenos\)</i></b>. Periphrastic<br>
 middle imperfect and accusative of extension of time <b><i>(all the<br>
 ninth hour)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:31 <B>{Is heard}</B> <b><i>(\eis&#275;kousth&#275;\)</i></b>. Sort of timeless first aorist<br>
 passive indicative as is "are had in remembrance" <b><i>(\emn&#275;sth&#275;san\.<br>
 See verse <!-#-->4 "are gone up for a memorial")</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:32 <B>{In the house of Simon}</B> <b><i>(\en oiki&#257;i Sim&#333;nos\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->9:43<br>
 for \para Sim&#333;ni\ with same idea.<br>
 <br>
 10:33 <B>{And thou hast well done that thou art come}</B> <b><i>(\su te kal&#333;s<br>
 epoi&#275;sas paragenomenos\)</i></b>. "And thou didst well in coming." A<br>
 regular formula for expressing thanks as in <!-#-->Php 4:14; 3Jo 1:6;<br>
 2Pe 1:19. The participle completes the idea of \kal&#333;s poie&#333;\<br>
 neatly. Cornelius commends Peter for his courage in breaking away<br>
 from Jewish custom and takes no offence at the implied<br>
 superiority of the Jews over the Gentiles. Cornelius and his<br>
 circle of kinsmen and close friends are prepared soil for a new<br>
 era in the history of Christianity. The Samaritans were now<br>
 nominal Jews and the Ethiopian eunuch was a single case, but here<br>
 Peter the chief apostle, not Philip the preaching deacon<br>
 <b><i>(evangelist)</i></b>, was involved. It was a crisis. Cornelius reveals an<br>
 open mind for the message of God through Peter. <B>{Commanded thee}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\prostetagmena soi\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle with the dative<br>
 case <b><i>(\soi\)</i></b>. Cornelius is a military man and he employs a<br>
 military term <b><i>(\prostass&#333;\, old word to command)</i></b>. He is ready for<br>
 orders from the Lord.<br>
 <br>
 10:34 <B>{Opened his mouth}</B> <b><i>(\anoixas to stoma\)</i></b>. Solemn formula for<br>
 beginning his address <b><i>(<!-#-->8:35; 18:14; Mt 5:2; 13:35)</i></b>. But also<br>
 good elocution for the speaker. <B>{I perceive}</B> <b><i>(\katalambanomai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Aoristic present middle of \katalamban&#333;\, to take hold of, the<br>
 middle noting mental action, to lay hold with the mind <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 4:13;<br>
 10:34; 25:25; Eph 3:18)</i></b>. It had been a difficult thing for Peter<br>
 to grasp, but now "of a truth" <b><i>(\ep' al&#275;theias\)</i></b> the light has<br>
 cleared away the fogs. It was not until Peter had crossed the<br>
 threshold of the house of Cornelius in the new environment and<br>
 standpoint that he sees this new and great truth. <B>{Respecter of<br>
 persons}</B> <b><i>(\pros&#333;pol&#275;mpt&#275;s\)</i></b>. This compound occurs only here and<br>
 in Chrysostom. It is composed of \pros&#333;pon\ face or person<br>
 <b><i>(\pros\ and \ops\, before the eye or face)</i></b> and \lamban&#333;\. The<br>
 abstract form \pros&#333;pol&#275;mpsia\ occurs in <!-#-->Jas 2:1 <b><i>(also <!-#-->Ro<br>
 2:11; Eph 6:9; Col 3:25)</i></b> and the verb \pros&#333;polempte&#333;\ in <!-#-->Jas<br>
 2:9. The separate phrase <b><i>(\lambanein pros&#333;pon\)</i></b> occurs in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 20:21; Ga 2:6. The phrase was already in the LXX <b><i>(<!-#-->De 10:17; 2Ch<br>
 19:7; Ps 82:6)</i></b>. Luke has simply combined the two words into one<br>
 compound one. The idea is to pay regard to one's looks or<br>
 circumstances rather than to his intrinsic character. The Jews<br>
 had come to feel that they were the favourites of God and<br>
 actually sons of the kingdom of heaven because they were<br>
 descendants of Abraham. John the Baptist rebuked them for this<br>
 fallacy.<br>
 <br>
 10:35 <B>{Acceptable to him}</B> <b><i>(\dektos aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Verbal adjective from<br>
 \dechomai\. _Acceptabilis_. That is to say, a Gentile would not<br>
 have to become a Jew in order to become a Christian. Evidently<br>
 Peter had not before perceived this fact. On the great Day of<br>
 Pentecost when he spoke of the promise "to all those afar off"<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2:39)</i></b> Peter understood that they must first become Jews and<br>
 then Christians. The new idea that now makes a revolution in<br>
 Peter's outlook is precisely this that Christ can and will save<br>
 Gentiles like this Cornelius group without their becoming Jews at<br>
 all.<br>
 <br>
 10:36 <B>{The word which he sent}</B> <b><i>(\ton logon hon apesteilen\)</i></b>. Many<br>
 ancient MSS. <b><i>(so Westcott and Hort)</i></b> read merely \ton logon<br>
 apesteilen\ <b><i>(he sent the word)</i></b>. This reading avoids the<br>
 anacoluthon and inverse attraction of \logon\ to the case of the<br>
 relative \hon\ <b><i>(which)</i></b>. <B>{Preaching good tidings of peace through<br>
 Jesus Christ}</B> <b><i>(\euaggelizomenos eir&#275;n&#275;n dia I&#275;sou Christou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Gospelizing peace through Jesus Christ. There is no other way to<br>
 have real peace between individuals and God, between races and<br>
 nations, than by Jesus Christ. Almost this very language occurs<br>
 in <!-#-->Eph 2:17 where Paul states that Jesus on the cross "preached<br>
 <b><i>(gospelized)</i></b> peace to you who are afar off and peace to you who<br>
 are near." Peter here sees what Paul will see later with great<br>
 clearness. <B>{He is Lord of all}</B> <b><i>(\houtos estin pant&#333;n kurios\)</i></b>. A<br>
 triumphant parenthesis that Peter throws in as the reason for his<br>
 new truth. Jesus Christ is Lord of all, both Jews and Gentiles.<br>
 <br>
 10:37 <B>{Ye know}</B> <b><i>(\humeis oidate\)</i></b>. Peter reminds his Gentile<br>
 audience that the main facts concerning Jesus and the gospel were<br>
 known to them. Note emphatic expression of \humeis\ <b><i>(you)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Beginning}</B> <b><i>(\arxamenos\)</i></b>. The Textus Receptus has \arxamenon\<br>
 <b><i>(accusative)</i></b>, but the nominative is given by Aleph A B C D E H<br>
 and is certainly correct. But it makes a decided anacoluthon. The<br>
 accusative would agree with \rh&#275;ma\ used in the sense of message<br>
 or story as told by the disciples. The nominative does not agree<br>
 with anything in the sentence. The same phrase occurs in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 23:5. Here is this aorist middle participle almost used like an<br>
 adverb. See a similar loose use of \arxamenos\ in the same sense<br>
 by Peter in <!-#-->Ac 1:22. The baptism of John is given as the<br>
 _terminus a quo_. The story began with a skip to Galilee after<br>
 the baptism just like the Gospel of Mark. This first message of<br>
 Peter to the Gentiles <b><i>(<!-#-->10:37-44)</i></b> corresponds in broad outline<br>
 with Mark's Gospel. Mark heard Peter preach many times and<br>
 evidently planned his Gospel <b><i>(the Roman Gospel)</i></b> on this same<br>
 model. There is in it nothing about the birth and childhood of<br>
 Jesus nor about the intervening ministry supplied by John's<br>
 Gospel for the period <b><i>(a year)</i></b> between the baptism and the<br>
 Galilean Ministry. Peter here presents an objective statement of<br>
 the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus with proof from the<br>
 Scriptures that he is the Messiah. It is a skilful presentation.<br>
 <br>
 10:38 <B>{Jesus of Nazareth}</B> <b><i>(\I&#275;soun ton apo Nazareth\)</i></b>. Jesus the<br>
 one from Nazareth, the article before the city identifying him<br>
 clearly. The accusative case is here by \prolepsis\, Jesus being<br>
 expressed for emphasis before the verb "anointed" and the pronoun<br>
 repeated pleonastically after it. "Jesus transfers the mind from<br>
 the gospel-history to the personal subject of it" <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>. <B>{God<br>
 anointed him}</B> <b><i>(\echrisen, auton, ho theos\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 of the verb \chri&#333;\, to anoint, from which the verbal \Christos\<br>
 is formed <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 2:36)</i></b>. The precise event referred to by Peter<br>
 could be the Incarnation <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:35f.)</i></b>, the Baptism <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 3:22)</i></b>,<br>
 the Ministry at Nazareth <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 4:14)</i></b>. Why not to the life and<br>
 work of Jesus as a whole? <B>{Went about doing good}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;lthen<br>
 euerget&#333;n\)</i></b>. Beautiful description of Jesus. Summary <b><i>(constative)</i></b><br>
 aorist active of \dierehomai\, to go through <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> or from<br>
 place to place. The present active participle \euerget&#333;n\ is from<br>
 the old verb \euergete&#333;\ <b><i>(\eu\, well, \ergon\, work)</i></b> and occurs<br>
 only here in the N.T. The substantive \euerget&#275;s\ <b><i>(benefactor)</i></b><br>
 was often applied to kings like Ptolemy Euergetes and that is the<br>
 sense in <!-#-->Lu 22:25 the only N.T. example. But the term applies<br>
 to Jesus far more than to Ptolemy or any earthly king <b><i>(Cornelius<br>
 a Lapide)</i></b>. <B>{And healing}</B> <b><i>(\kai i&#333;menos\)</i></b>. And in particular<br>
 healing. Luke does not exclude other diseases <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Lu<br>
 13:11,16)</i></b>, but he lays special emphasis on demoniacal possession<br>
 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mr 1:23)</i></b>. <B>{That were oppressed}</B> <b><i>(\tous<br>
 katadunasteuomenous\)</i></b>. Present passive articular participle of<br>
 \katadunasteu&#333;\. A late verb in LXX and papyri. In the N.T. only<br>
 here and <!-#-->Jas 2:6 <b><i>(best MSS.)</i></b>. One of the compounds of \kata\<br>
 made transitive. The reality of the devil <b><i>(the slanderer,<br>
 \diabolos\)</i></b> is recognized by Peter. <B>{For God was with him}</B> <b><i>(\hoti<br>
 ho theos &#275;n met' autou\)</i></b>. Surely this reason does not reveal "a<br>
 low Christology" as some charge. Peter had used the same language<br>
 in <!-#-->Ac 7:9 and earlier in <!-#-->Lu 1:28,66 as Nicodemus does in <!-#-->Joh<br>
 3:2.<br>
 <br>
 10:39 <B>{And we are witnesses}</B> <b><i>(\kai h&#275;meis martures\)</i></b>. Compare "ye<br>
 yourselves know" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->37)</i></b>. Peter thus appeals to what the<br>
 audience know and to what the disciples know. He made the same<br>
 claim about personal witnesses of the Resurrection of Jesus at<br>
 Pentecost <b><i>(<!-#-->2:32)</i></b>. Here Peter affirms full knowledge of the work<br>
 of Jesus in Judea <b><i>(for whole country including Galilee and Perea)</i></b><br>
 and Jerusalem <b><i>(given mainly in John's Gospel)</i></b>. In the Greek \h&#333;n\<br>
 <b><i>(which)</i></b> is attracted into the genitive case to agree with the<br>
 antecedent \pant&#333;n\ <b><i>(all)</i></b>, a common enough idiom. <B>{Whom also they<br>
 slew}</B> <b><i>(\hon kai aneilan\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative of<br>
 \anaire&#333;\ with \a\ as often in Acts <b><i>(<!-#-->2:23; 5:30)</i></b>. But note<br>
 \kai\ <b><i>(also)</i></b> in the old MSS., not in the Textus Receptus. They<br>
 "also" slew him, went that far, "this crowning atrocity"<br>
 <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>, \kai\ could here be "even." <B>{Hanging him on a tree}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kremasantes epi xulou\)</i></b>. This same expression used by Peter in<br>
 <!-#-->5:30 which see for discussion.<br>
 <br>
 10:40 <B>{Gave him to be made manifest}</B> <b><i>(\ed&#333;ken auton emphan&#275;<br>
 genesthai\)</i></b>. Peculiar phrase, here only in the N.T. and in <!-#-->Ro<br>
 10:20 <b><i>(quoted from <!-#-->Isa 65:1)</i></b>. \Emphan&#275;\, predicate accusative<br>
 after infinitive \genesthai\ agreeing with \auton\ object of<br>
 \ed&#333;ken\.<br>
 <br>
 10:41 <B>{Chosen before}</B> <b><i>(\prokecheiroton&#275;menois\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle dative plural from \procheirotone&#333;\, to choose or<br>
 designate by hand <b><i>(\cheirotone&#333;, cheir\, hand, and \tein&#333;\, to<br>
 stretch, as in <!-#-->Ac 14:23; 2Co 8:19)</i></b>, beforehand <b><i>(\pro\)</i></b>, a<br>
 double compound as old as Plato, but here alone in the N.T. Peter<br>
 is evidently stating the thing as it happened and not trying to<br>
 make a convincing story by saying that both friends and foes saw<br>
 him after his resurrection. It is the "historian's candour"<br>
 <b><i>(Paley)</i></b> in Luke here that adds to the credibility of the<br>
 narrative. The sceptical Jews would not have believed and Jesus<br>
 was kept from open contact with the world of sin after his<br>
 Passion. <B>{To us who did eat and drink with him}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;min hoitines<br>
 sunephagomen kai sunepiomen aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. The "who" <b><i>(\hoitines\)</i></b> is<br>
 first person agreeing with "us" <b><i>(\h&#275;min\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative of the common verbs \sunesthi&#333;\ and \sumpin&#333;\. \Aut&#333;i\<br>
 is associative instrumental case. There are difficulties to us in<br>
 understanding how Jesus could eat and drink after the<br>
 resurrection as told here and in <!-#-->Lu 24:41-3, but at any rate<br>
 Peter makes it clear that it was no hallucination or ghost, but<br>
 Jesus himself whom they saw after he rose from the dead, "after<br>
 the rising as to him" <b><i>(\meta to anast&#275;nai auton\, \meta\ with the<br>
 accusative articular infinitive second aorist active and the<br>
 accusative \auton\ of general reference)</i></b>. Furneaux dares to think<br>
 that the disciples misunderstood Jesus about eating after the<br>
 resurrection. But that is to deny the testimony merely because we<br>
 cannot explain the transition state of the body of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 10:42 <B>{He charged}</B> <b><i>(\par&#275;ggeilen\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative as in <!-#-->1:4. There Jesus is the subject and so<br>
 probably here, though Page insists that \ho theos\ <b><i>(God)</i></b> is here<br>
 because of verse <!-#-->40. <B>{To testify}</B> <b><i>(\diamarturasthai\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist middle infinitive. See on &#175;2:40. <B>{Ordained}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\h&#333;rismenos\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of \horiz&#333;\, old verb,<br>
 to mark out, to limit, to make a horizon. <B>{Judge}</B> <b><i>(\krit&#275;s\)</i></b>. The<br>
 same point made by Peter in <!-#-->1Pe 4:5. He does not use the word<br>
 "Messiah" to these Gentiles though he did say "anointed"<br>
 <b><i>(\echrisen\)</i></b> in verse <!-#-->38. Peter's claim for Jesus is that he is<br>
 the Judge of Jew and Gentile <b><i>(living and dead)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:43 <B>{Every one that believeth}</B> <b><i>(\panta ton pisteuonta\)</i></b>. This<br>
 accusative active participle of general reference with the<br>
 infinitive in indirect discourse is the usual idiom. Only<br>
 \labein\ <b><i>(second aorist active infinitive of \lamban&#333;\)</i></b> is not<br>
 indirect statement so much as indirect command or arrangement.<br>
 The prophets bear witness to Jesus Christ to this effect. It is<br>
 God's plan and no race distinctions are drawn. Peter had already<br>
 said the same thing at Pentecost <b><i>(<!-#-->2:38)</i></b>, but now he sees<br>
 himself that Gentiles do not have to become Jews, but have only<br>
 to believe in Jesus as Messiah and Judge as foretold by the<br>
 prophets. It was glorious news to Cornelius and his group.<br>
 <B>{Through his name}</B> <b><i>(\dia tou onomatos autou\)</i></b>, not as a _title_<br>
 or magic formula <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:13)</i></b>, but the power of Christ himself<br>
 represented by his name.<br>
 <br>
 10:44 <B>{While Peter yet spake}</B> <b><i>(\eti lalountos tou Petrou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute of present participle, still going on. <B>{The<br>
 Holy Ghost fell}</B> <b><i>(\epepesen to pneuma to hagion\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active indicative of \epipipt&#333;\, old verb to fall upon, to<br>
 recline, to come upon. Used of the Holy Spirit in <!-#-->8:16; 10:44;<br>
 11:15. It appears that Peter was interrupted in his sermon by<br>
 this remarkable event. The Jews had received the Holy Spirit<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2:4)</i></b>, the Samaritans <b><i>(<!-#-->8:17)</i></b>, and now Gentiles. But on this<br>
 occasion it was before baptism, as was apparently true in Paul's<br>
 case <b><i>(<!-#-->9:17f.)</i></b>. In <!-#-->8:16; 19:5 the hands of the apostles were<br>
 also placed after baptism on those who received the Holy Spirit.<br>
 Here it was unexpected by Peter and by Cornelius and was<br>
 indubitable proof of the conversion of these Gentiles who had<br>
 accepted Peter's message and had believed on Jesus Christ as<br>
 Saviour.<br>
 <br>
 10:45 <B>{They of the circumcision which believed}</B> <b><i>(\hoi ek<br>
 peritom&#275;s pistoi\)</i></b>. The believing ones of the circumcision, more<br>
 exactly. <B>{Were amazed}</B> <b><i>(\exest&#275;san\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative, intransitive, of \exist&#275;mi\. They stood out of<br>
 themselves. <B>{On the Gentiles also}</B> <b><i>(\kai epi ta ethn&#275;\)</i></b>. Or, even<br>
 upon the Gentiles. <B>{Was poured out}</B> <b><i>(\ekkechutai\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 perfect passive retained in indirect discourse of \ekche&#333;\ or<br>
 \ekchun&#333;\, old verb, used metaphorically of the Holy Spirit also<br>
 in <!-#-->2:17 <b><i>(from <!-#-->Joe 2:28f.)</i></b>, <!-#-->Ac 2:33.<br>
 <br>
 10:46 <B>{They heard}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kouon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, were hearing,<br>
 kept on hearing. <B>{Speak}</B> <b><i>(\lalount&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present active<br>
 participle, speaking, for they kept it up. <B>{With tongues}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\gl&#333;ssais\)</i></b>. Instrumental case as in <!-#-->2:4,11 which see. The<br>
 fuller statement there makes it clear that here it was new and<br>
 strange tongues also as in <!-#-->19:6; 1Co 14:4-19. This sudden<br>
 manifestation of the Holy Spirit's power on uncircumcised<br>
 Gentiles was probably necessary to convince Peter and the six<br>
 brethren of the circumcision that God had opened the door wide to<br>
 Gentiles. It was proof that a Gentile Pentecost had come and<br>
 Peter used it effectively in his defence in Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 11:15)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:47 <B>{Can any man forbid the water?}</B> <b><i>(\M&#275;ti to hud&#333;r dunatai<br>
 k&#333;l&#8211;sai tis?\)</i></b>. The negative \m&#275;ti\ expects the answer _No_. The<br>
 evidence was indisputable that these Gentiles were converted and<br>
 so were entitled to be baptized. See the similar idiom in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 6:39. Note the article with "water." Here the baptism of the<br>
 Holy Spirit had preceded the baptism of water <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 1:5; 11:16)</i></b>.<br>
 "The greater had been bestowed; could the lesser be withheld?"<br>
 <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. <B>{That these should not be baptized}</B> <b><i>(\tou m&#275;<br>
 baptisth&#275;nai toutous\)</i></b>. Ablative case of the articular first<br>
 aorist passive infinitive of \baptiz&#333;\ with the redundant<br>
 negative after the verb of hindering <b><i>(\k&#333;l&#8211;sai\)</i></b> and the<br>
 accusative of general reference <b><i>(\toutous\)</i></b>. The redundant<br>
 negative after the verb of hindering is not necessary though<br>
 often used in ancient Greek and in the _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(papyri)</i></b>. Without<br>
 it see <!-#-->Mt 19:14; Ac 8:36 and with it see <!-#-->Lu 4:42; 24:16; Ac<br>
 14:18. Cf. Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 1061, 1094, 1171. The<br>
 triple negatives here are a bit confusing to the modern mind<br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275;ti\ in the question, \k&#333;l&#8211;sai\, to hinder or to cut off, \m&#275;\<br>
 with \baptisth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. Literally, Can any one cut off the water<br>
 from the being baptized as to these? Meyer: "The water is in this<br>
 animated language conceived as the element offering itself for<br>
 the baptism." <B>{As well as we}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s kai h&#275;meis\)</i></b>. The argument<br>
 was conclusive. God had spoken. Note the query of the eunuch to<br>
 Philip <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 8:36)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:48 <B>{Commanded}</B> <b><i>(\prosetaxen\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative.<br>
 Peter himself abstained from baptizing on this occasion <b><i>(cf. Paul<br>
 in <!-#-->1Co 1:14)</i></b>. Evidently it was done by the six Jewish brethren.<br>
 <B>{Them to be baptized}</B> <b><i>(\autous baptisth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. Accusative of<br>
 general reference with the first aorist passive infinitive. <B>{In<br>
 the name of Jesus Christ}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i onomati I&#275;sou Christou\)</i></b>. The<br>
 essential name in Christian baptism as in <!-#-->2:38; 19:5. But these<br>
 passages give the authority for the act, not the formula that was<br>
 employed <b><i>(Alvah Hovey in Hackett's _Commentary_. See also chapter<br>
 on the Baptismal Formula in my _The Christ of the Logia_)</i></b>.<br>
 "Golden days" <b><i>(\aurei dies\, Bengel)</i></b> were these for the whole<br>
 group.<br>
