 <HR>
<p>9:1 <B>{He called the twelve together}</B> <b><i>(\sunkalesamenos tous<br>
 d&#333;deka\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr 6:7; Mt 10:1 have \proskale&#333;mai\, to call to him.<br>
 Both the indirect middle voice.<br>
 <br>
 9:2 <B>{He sent them forth}</B> <b><i>(\apesteilen autous\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active indicative of \apostell&#333;\. <B>{To preach the kingdom of God<br>
 and to heal the sick}</B> <b><i>(\k&#275;russein t&#275;n basileian tou theou kai<br>
 i&#257;sthai\)</i></b>. Present indicative for the continuous functions during<br>
 this campaign. This double office of herald <b><i>(\k&#275;russein\)</i></b> and<br>
 healer <b><i>(\i&#257;sthai\)</i></b> is stated directly in <!-#-->Mt 10:7-8. Note the<br>
 verb \iaomai\ for healing here, though \therapeuein\ in verse<br>
 <!-#-->1, apparently used interchangeably.<br>
 <br>
 9:3 <B>{Neither staff}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;te rabdon\)</i></b>. For the apparent<br>
 contradiction between these words <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:10)</i></b> and <!-#-->Mr 6:8 see<br>
 discussion there. For \p&#275;ran\ <b><i>(wallet)</i></b> see also on &#175;Mr 6:8 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 10:10)</i></b> for this and other details here.<br>
 <br>
 9:5 <B>{As many as receive you not}</B> <b><i>(\hosoi an m&#275; dech&#333;ntai humas\)</i></b>.<br>
 Indefinite relative plural with \an\ and present middle<br>
 subjunctive and the negative \m&#275;\. Here <!-#-->Mt 10:14 has the<br>
 singular <b><i>(whosoever)</i></b> and <!-#-->Mr 6:11 has "whatsoever place." <B>{For a<br>
 testimony against them}</B> <b><i>(\eis marturion ep' autous\)</i></b>. Note use of<br>
 \ep' autous\ where <!-#-->Mr 6:11 has simply the dative \autois\<br>
 <b><i>(disadvantage)</i></b>, really the same idea.<br>
 <br>
 9:6 <B>{Went}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;rchonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, continuous and<br>
 repeated action made plainer also by three present participles<br>
 <b><i>(\exerchomenoi, euaggelizomenoi, therapeuontes\)</i></b>, describing the<br>
 wide extent of the work through all the villages <b><i>(\kata tas<br>
 k&#333;mas\, distributive use of \kata\)</i></b> everywhere <b><i>(\pantachou\)</i></b> in<br>
 Galilee.<br>
 <br>
 9:7 <B>{All that was done}</B> <b><i>(\ta ginomena panta\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 participle, "all that was coming to pass." <B>{He was much<br>
 perplexed}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;porei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \diapore&#333;\, to be<br>
 thoroughly at a loss, unable to find a way out <b><i>(\dia, a\<br>
 privative, \poros\, way)</i></b>, common ancient verb, but only in Luke's<br>
 writings in the N.T. <B>{Because it was said}</B> <b><i>(\dia to legesthai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Neat Greek idiom, the articular passive infinitive after \dia\.<br>
 Three reports came to the ears of Herod as Luke has it, each<br>
 introduced by \hoti\ <b><i>(that)</i></b> in indirect discourse: "By some"<br>
 <b><i>(\hupo tin&#333;n\)</i></b>, "by some" <b><i>(\hupo tin&#333;n de\)</i></b>, "by others" <b><i>(\all&#333;n<br>
 de, hupo\ not here expressed, but carried over)</i></b>. The verbs in the<br>
 indirect discourse here <b><i>(verses <!-#-->7,8)</i></b> are all three aorists<br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;gerth&#275;\ first passive; \ephan&#275;\ second passive; \anest&#275;\<br>
 second active)</i></b>, not past perfects as the English has them.<br>
 <br>
 9:9 <B>{He sought}</B> <b><i>(\ez&#275;tei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. He keep on seeking<br>
 to see Jesus. The rumours disturbed Herod because he was sure<br>
 that he had put him to death <b><i>("John I beheaded")</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:10 <B>{Declared}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;g&#275;santo\)</i></b>. First aorist middle of<br>
 \di&#275;geomai\, to carry a narrative through to the end. Jesus<br>
 listened to it all. <B>{They had done}</B> <b><i>(\epoi&#275;san\)</i></b>. Aorist active<br>
 indicative, they did. <B>{He took them}</B> <b><i>(\paralab&#333;n autous\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active participle of \paralamban&#333;\. Very common verb.<br>
 <B>{Bethsaida}</B> <b><i>(\B&#275;thsaida\)</i></b>. Peculiar to Luke. Bethsaida Julias is<br>
 the territory of Philip, for it is on the other side of the Sea<br>
 of Galilee <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:1)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:11 <B>{Spake}</B> <b><i>(\elalei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, he continued speaking.<br>
 <B>{He healed}</B> <b><i>(\i&#257;to\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, he continued healing.<br>
 <br>
 9:12 <B>{To wear away}</B> <b><i>(\klinein\)</i></b>. Old verb usually transitive, to<br>
 bend or bow down. Many compounds as in English decline, incline,<br>
 recline, clinic <b><i>(\klin&#275;\, bed)</i></b>, etc. Luke alone in the N.T. uses<br>
 it intransitively as here. The sun was turning down towards<br>
 setting. <B>{Lodge}</B> <b><i>(\katalus&#333;sin\)</i></b>. First aorist active subjunctive<br>
 of \katalu&#333;\, a common verb, to dissolve, destroy, overthrow, and<br>
 then of travellers to break a journey, to lodge <b><i>(\kataluma\, inn,<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 2:7)</i></b>. Only here and <!-#-->19:7 in the N.T. in this sense. <B>{Get<br>
 victuals}</B> <b><i>(\heur&#333;sin episitismon\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist active of<br>
 \heurisk&#333;\, very common verb. <B>{Victuals}</B> <b><i>(\episitismon\, from<br>
 \episitizomai\, to provision oneself, \sitiz&#333;\, from \siton\,<br>
 wheat)</i></b> only here in the N.T., though common in ancient Greek,<br>
 especially for provisions for a journey <b><i>(snack)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mr<br>
 6:32-44; Mt 14:13-21 for discussion of details.<br>
 <br>
 9:13 <B>{Except we should go and buy food}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275;ti poreuthentes<br>
 h&#275;meis agoras&#333;men br&#333;mata\)</i></b>. This is a condition of the third<br>
 class with the aorist subjunctive <b><i>(\agoras&#333;men\)</i></b>, where the<br>
 conjunction is usually \ean\ <b><i>(with negative \ean m&#275;\)</i></b>, but not<br>
 always or necessarily so especially in the _Koin&#275;_. So in <!-#-->1Co<br>
 14:5 \ei m&#275; dierm&#275;neu&#275;i\ and in <!-#-->Php 3:12 \ei kai katalab&#333;\.<br>
 "Unless" is better here than "except." <B>{Food}</B> <b><i>(\br&#333;mata\)</i></b>, means<br>
 eaten pieces from \bibr&#333;sk&#333;\, to eat, somewhat like our "edibles"<br>
 or vernacular "eats."<br>
 <br>
 9:14 <B>{About}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;sei\)</i></b>. Luke as <!-#-->Mt 14:21 adds this word to the<br>
 definite statement of <!-#-->Mr 6:44 that there were 5,000 men, a<br>
 hundred companies of fifty each. <B>{Sit down}</B> <b><i>(\kataklinate\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active imperative. Recline, lie down. Only in Luke<br>
 in the N.T. See also verse <!-#-->15. <B>{In companies}</B> <b><i>(\klisias\)</i></b>.<br>
 Cognate accusative after <B>{kataklinate}</B>. Only here in the N.T. A<br>
 row of persons reclining at meals <b><i>(table company)</i></b>. <B>{About fifty<br>
 each}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;sei ana pent&#275;konta\)</i></b>. Distributive use of \ana\ and<br>
 approximate number again <b><i>(\h&#333;sei\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:16 <B>{The five ... the two}</B> <b><i>(\tous pente ... tous duo\)</i></b>. Pointing<br>
 back to verse <!-#-->13, fine example of the Greek article. <B>{And gave}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai edidou\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \did&#333;mi\, kept on giving.<br>
 This picturesque imperfect is preceded by the aorist \kateklasen\<br>
 <b><i>(brake)</i></b>, a single act. This latter verb in the N.T. only here and<br>
 the parallel in <!-#-->Mr 6:41, though common enough in ancient Greek.<br>
 We say "break off" where here the Greek has "break down" <b><i>(or<br>
 thoroughly)</i></b>, perfective use of \kata\.<br>
 <br>
 9:17 <B>{Twelve baskets}</B> <b><i>(\kophinoi d&#333;deka\)</i></b>. For discussion of<br>
 \kophonoi\ and \sphurides\ as well as of \klasmata\ <b><i>(broken<br>
 pieces)</i></b> see on &#175;Mr 6:43; Mt 14:20.<br>
 <br>
 9:18 <B>{As he was praying}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i einai auton proseuchomenon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Common Lukan idiom of \en\ with the articular infinitive for a<br>
 temporal clause, only here Luke has the periphrastic infinitive<br>
 <b><i>(\einai proseuchomenon\)</i></b> as also in <!-#-->11:1. This item about<br>
 Christ's praying alone in Luke. <B>{Alone}</B> <b><i>(\kata monas\)</i></b>. In the<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mr 4:10. Perhaps \ch&#333;ras\ <b><i>(places)</i></b> is to be<br>
 supplied with \monas\ <b><i>(lonely places)</i></b>. <B>{Were with him}</B> <b><i>(\sun&#275;san<br>
 aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. This seems like a contradiction unless "alone" is to be<br>
 taken with \sun&#275;san\. Westcott and Hort put \sun&#275;nt&#275;san\ in the<br>
 margin. This would mean that as Jesus was praying alone, the<br>
 disciples fell in with him. At any rate he was praying apart from<br>
 them.<br>
 <br>
 9:19 <B>{That I am}</B> <b><i>(\me einai\)</i></b>. Accusative and infinitive in<br>
 indirect assertion, a common Greek idiom. <!-#-->Mt 16:13 for "I" has<br>
 "the Son of man" as identical in the consciousness of Christ. The<br>
 various opinions of men about Jesus here run parallel to the<br>
 rumours heard by Herod <b><i>(verses <!-#-->8,9)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:20 <B>{But who say ye?}</B> <b><i>(\Humeis de tina legete;\)</i></b>. Note the<br>
 emphatic proleptical position of \humeis\: "But _ye_ who do ye<br>
 say? This is really what mattered now with Jesus. <B>{The Christ of<br>
 God}</B> <b><i>(\Ton christon tou theou\)</i></b>. The accusative though the<br>
 infinitive is not expressed. The Anointed of God, the Messiah of<br>
 God. See on &#175;2:26 for "the Anointed of the Lord." See on &#175;Mt<br>
 16:17 for discussion of Peter's testimony in full. <!-#-->Mr 6:29 has<br>
 simply "the Christ." It is clear from the previous narrative that<br>
 this is not a new discovery from Simon Peter, but simply the<br>
 settled conviction of the disciples after all the defections of<br>
 the Galilean masses and the hostility of the Jerusalem<br>
 ecclesiastics. The disciples still believed in Jesus as the<br>
 Messiah of Jewish hope and prophecy. It will become plain that<br>
 they do not grasp the spiritual conception of the Messiah and his<br>
 kingdom that Jesus taught, but they are clear that he is the<br>
 Messiah however faulty their view of the Messiah may be. There<br>
 was comfort in this for Jesus. They were loyal to him.<br>
 <br>
 9:21 <B>{To tell this to no man}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;deni legein touto\)</i></b>. Indirect<br>
 command with the negative infinitive after <B>{commanded}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\par&#275;ggeilen\)</i></b>. It had been necessary for Jesus to cease using<br>
 the word <B>{Messiah}</B> <b><i>(\Christos\)</i></b> about himself because of the<br>
 political meaning to the Jews. Its use by the disciples would<br>
 lead to revolution as was plain after the feeding of the five<br>
 thousand <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:15)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:22 <B>{Rejected}</B> <b><i>(\apodokimasth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 infinitive of \apodokimaz&#333;\, to reject after trial. <B>{The third<br>
 day}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i trit&#275;i h&#275;mer&#257;i\)</i></b>. Locative case of time as in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 16:21. Here in the parallel passage <!-#-->Mr 8:31 has "after three<br>
 days" <b><i>(\meta treis h&#275;meras\)</i></b> in precisely the same sense. That is<br>
 to say, "after three days" is just a free way of saying "on the<br>
 third day" and cannot mean "on the fourth day" if taken too<br>
 literally. For discussion of this plain prediction of the death<br>
 of Christ with various details see discussion on <!-#-->Mt 16:21; Mr<br>
 8:31. It was a melancholy outlook that depressed the disciples<br>
 as Mark and Matthew show in the protest of Peter and his rebuke.<br>
 <br>
 9:23 <B>{He said unto all}</B> <b><i>(\elegen de pros pantas\)</i></b>. This is like<br>
 Luke <b><i>(cf. verse <!-#-->43)</i></b>. Jesus wanted all <b><i>(the multitude with his<br>
 disciples, as <!-#-->Mr 8:34 has it)</i></b> to understand the lesson of<br>
 self-sacrifice. They could not yet understand the full meaning of<br>
 Christ's words as applied to his approaching death of which he<br>
 had been speaking. But certainly the shadow of the cross is<br>
 already across the path of Jesus as he is here speaking. For<br>
 details <b><i>(soul, life, forfeit, gain, profit, lose, world)</i></b> see<br>
 discussion on &#175;Mt 16:24-26; Mr 8:34-37. The word for lose<br>
 <b><i>(\apolesei\, from \apollumi\, a very common verb)</i></b> is used in the<br>
 sense of destroy, kill, lose, as here. Note the mercantile terms<br>
 in this passage <b><i>(gain, lose, fine or forfeit, exchange)</i></b>. <B>{Daily}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kath' h&#275;meran\)</i></b>. Peculiar to Luke in this incident. Take up the<br>
 cross <b><i>(his own cross)</i></b> daily <b><i>(aorist tense, \&#257;rat&#333;\)</i></b>, but keep on<br>
 following me <b><i>(\akoloutheit&#333;\, present tense)</i></b>. The cross was a<br>
 familiar figure in Palestine. It was rising before Jesus as his<br>
 destiny. Each man has his own cross to meet and bear.<br>
 <br>
 9:26 <B>{Whosoever shall be ashamed}</B> <b><i>(\hos an epaischunth&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Rather, <B>{Whosoever is ashamed}</B> as in <!-#-->Mr 8:38. The first aorist<br>
 passive subjunctive in an indefinite relative clause with \an\.<br>
 The passive verb is transitive here also. This verb is from \epi\<br>
 and \aischun&#275;\, shame <b><i>(in the eyes of men)</i></b>. Jesus endured the<br>
 shame of the cross <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 12:2)</i></b>. The man at the feast who had to<br>
 take a lower seat did it with shame <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 14:9)</i></b>. Paul is not<br>
 ashamed of the Gospel <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:16)</i></b>. Onesiphorus was not ashamed of<br>
 Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 1:16)</i></b>. <B>{In his own glory}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i dox&#275;i autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 This item added to what is in <!-#-->Mr 8:38; Mt 16:27.<br>
 <br>
 9:27 <B>{Till they see}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s an id&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 subjunctive with \he&#333;s\ and \an\ referring to the future, an<br>
 idiomatic construction. So in <!-#-->Mr 9:1; Mt 16:28. In all three<br>
 passages "shall not taste of death" <b><i>(\ou m&#275; geus&#333;ntai thanatou\,<br>
 double negative with aorist middle subjunctive)</i></b> occurs also.<br>
 Rabbinical writings use this figure. Like a physician Christ<br>
 tasted death that we may see how to die. Jesus referred to the<br>
 cross as "this cup" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:36; Mt 26:39; Lu 22:42)</i></b>. Mark speaks<br>
 of the kingdom of God as "come" <b><i>(\el&#275;luthuian\, second perfect<br>
 active participle)</i></b>. Matthew as "coming" <b><i>(\erchomenon\)</i></b> referring<br>
 to the Son of man, while Luke has neither form. See Matthew and<br>
 Mark for discussion of the theories of interpretation of this<br>
 difficult passage. The Transfiguration follows in a week and may<br>
 be the first fulfilment in the mind of Jesus. It may also<br>
 symbolically point to the second coming.<br>
 <br>
 9:28 <B>{About eight days}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;sei h&#275;merai okt&#333;\)</i></b>. A _nominativus<br>
 pendens_ without connexion or construction. <!-#-->Mr 9:2 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 17:1)</i></b><br>
 has "after six days" which agrees with the general statement.<br>
 <B>{Into the mountain}</B> <b><i>(\eis to oros\)</i></b>. Probably Mount Hermon<br>
 because we know that Jesus was near Caesarea Philippi when Peter<br>
 made the confession <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 8:27; Mt 16:13)</i></b>. Hermon is still the<br>
 glory of Palestine from whose heights one can view the whole of<br>
 the land. It was a fit place for the Transfiguration. <B>{To pray}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\proseuxasthai\)</i></b>. Peculiar to Luke who so often mentions<br>
 Christ's habit of prayer <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->3:21)</i></b>. See also verse <!-#-->29 "as he<br>
 was praying" <b><i>(\en t&#333;i proseuchesthai\, one of Luke's favourite<br>
 idioms)</i></b>. <B>{His countenance was altered}</B> <b><i>(\egeneto to eidos tou<br>
 pros&#333;pou autou heteron\)</i></b>. Literally, "the appearance of his face<br>
 became different." <!-#-->Mt 17:2 says that "his face did shine as the<br>
 sun." Luke does not use the word "transfigured" <b><i>(\metemorph&#333;th&#275;\)</i></b><br>
 in <!-#-->Mr 9:2; Mt 17:2. He may have avoided this word because of<br>
 the pagan associations with this word as Ovid's \Metamorphoses\.<br>
 <B>{And his raiment became white and dazzling}</B> <b><i>(\kai ho himatismos<br>
 autou leukos exastrapt&#333;n\)</i></b>. Literally, <B>{And his raiment white<br>
 radiant}</B>. There is no _and_ between "white" and "dazzling." The<br>
 participle \exastrapt&#333;n\ is from the compound verb meaning to<br>
 flash <b><i>(\astrapt&#333;\)</i></b> out or forth <b><i>(\ex\)</i></b>. The simple verb is common<br>
 for lightning flashes and bolts, but the compound in the LXX and<br>
 here alone in the N.T. See <!-#-->Mr 9:3 "exceeding white" and <!-#-->Mt<br>
 17:2 "white as the light."<br>
 <br>
 9:31 <B>{There talked with him}</B> <b><i>(\sunelaloun aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active, were talking with him. <B>{Who appeared in glory}</B> <b><i>(\hoi<br>
 ophthentes en dox&#275;i\)</i></b>. First aorist passive participle of<br>
 \hora&#333;\. This item peculiar to Luke. Compare verse <!-#-->26. <B>{Spake<br>
 of his decease}</B> <b><i>(\elegon t&#275;n exodon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, were<br>
 talking about his \exodus\ <b><i>(departure from earth to heaven)</i></b> very<br>
 much like our English word "decease" <b><i>(Latin _decessus_, a going<br>
 away)</i></b>. The glorious light graphically revealed Moses and Elijah<br>
 talking with Jesus about the very subject concerning which Peter<br>
 had dared to rebuke Jesus for mentioning <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 8:32; Mt 16:22)</i></b>.<br>
 This very word \exodus\ <b><i>(way out)</i></b> in the sense of death occurs in<br>
 <!-#-->2Pe 1:15 and is followed by a brief description of the<br>
 Transfiguration glory. Other words for death <b><i>(\thanatos\)</i></b> in the<br>
 N.T. are \ekbasis\, going out as departure <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 13:7)</i></b>,<br>
 \aphixis\, departing <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:29)</i></b>, \analusis\, loosening anchor<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 4:6)</i></b> and \analusai\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 1:23)</i></b>. <B>{To accomplish}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pl&#275;roun\)</i></b>. To fulfil. Moses had led the Exodus from Egypt.<br>
 Jesus will accomplish the exodus of God's people into the<br>
 Promised Land on high. See on Mark and Matthew for discussion of<br>
 significance of the appearance of Moses and Elijah as<br>
 representatives of law and prophecy and with a peculiar death.<br>
 The purpose of the Transfiguration was to strengthen the heart of<br>
 Jesus as he was praying long about his approaching death and to<br>
 give these chosen three disciples a glimpse of his glory for the<br>
 hour of darkness coming. No one on earth understood the heart of<br>
 Jesus and so Moses and Elijah came. The poor disciples utterly<br>
 failed to grasp the significance of it all.<br>
 <br>
 9:32 <B>{Were heavy with sleep}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san bebar&#275;menoi hupn&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic past perfect of \bare&#333;\, a late form for the ancient<br>
 \barun&#333;\ <b><i>(not in N.T. save Textus Receptus in <!-#-->Lu 21:34)</i></b>. This<br>
 form, rare and only in passive <b><i>(present, aorist, perfect)</i></b> in the<br>
 N.T., is like \barun&#333;\, from \barus\, and that from \baros\,<br>
 weight, burden <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 6:2)</i></b>. \Hupn&#333;i\ is in the instrumental case.<br>
 They had apparently climbed the mountain in the early part of the<br>
 night and were now overcome with sleep as Jesus prolonged his<br>
 prayer. Luke alone tells of their sleep. The same word is used of<br>
 the eyes of these three disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 26:43)</i></b> and of the hearts of many <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 21:34)</i></b>. <B>{But when<br>
 they were fully awake}</B> <b><i>(\diagr&#275;gor&#275;santes de\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active participle of this late <b><i>(Herodian)</i></b> and rare compound verb<br>
 <b><i>(here alone in the N.T.)</i></b>, \diagr&#275;gore&#333;\ <b><i>(Luke is fond of<br>
 compounds with \dia\)</i></b>. The simple verb \gr&#275;gore&#333;\ <b><i>(from the<br>
 second perfect active \egr&#275;gora\)</i></b> is also late, but common in the<br>
 LXX and the N.T. The effect of \dia\ can be either to remain<br>
 awake in spite of desire to sleep <b><i>(margin of Revised Version)</i></b> or<br>
 to become thoroughly awake <b><i>(ingressive aorist tense also)</i></b> as<br>
 Revised Version has it. This is most likely correct. The Syriac<br>
 Sinaitic has it "When they awoke." Certainly they had been<br>
 through a strain. <B>{His glory}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n doxan autou\)</i></b>. See also verse<br>
 <!-#-->26 in the words of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 9:33 <B>{As they were departing from him}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i diach&#333;rizesthai<br>
 autous ap' autou\)</i></b>. Peculiar to Luke and another instance of<br>
 Luke's common idiom of \en\ with the articular infinitive in a<br>
 temporal clause. This common verb occurs here only in the N.T.<br>
 The present middle voice means to separate oneself fully <b><i>(direct<br>
 middle)</i></b>. This departing of Moses and Elijah apparently<br>
 accompanied Peter's remark as given in all three Gospels. See for<br>
 details on Mark and Matthew. <B>{Master}</B> <b><i>(\Epistata\)</i></b> here, <B>{Rabbi}</B><br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 9:5)</i></b>, <B>{Lord}</B> <b><i>(\Kurie\, <!-#-->Mt 17:4)</i></b>. <B>{Let us make}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\poi&#275;s&#333;men\, first aorist active subjunctive)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Mr 9:5,<br>
 but <!-#-->Mt 17:4 has "I will make" <b><i>(\poi&#275;s&#333;\)</i></b>. It was near the time<br>
 of the feast of the tabernacles. So Peter proposes that they<br>
 celebrate it up here instead of going to Jerusalem for it as they<br>
 did a bit later <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 7)</i></b>. <B>{Not knowing what he said}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; eid&#333;s<br>
 ho legei\)</i></b>. Literally, <B>{not understanding what he was saying}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275;\, regular negative with participle and \legei\, present<br>
 indicative retained in relative clause in indirect discourse)</i></b>.<br>
 Luke puts it more bluntly than Mark <b><i>(Peter's account)</i></b>, "For he<br>
 wist not what to answer; for they became sore afraid" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 9:6)</i></b>.<br>
 Peter acted according to his impulsive nature and spoke up even<br>
 though he did not know what to say or even what he was saying<br>
 when he spoke. He was only half awake as Luke explains and he was<br>
 sore afraid as Mark <b><i>(Peter)</i></b> explains. He had bewilderment enough<br>
 beyond a doubt, but it was Peter who spoke, not James and John.<br>
 <br>
 9:34 <B>{Overshadowed them}</B> <b><i>(\epeskiazen autous\)</i></b>. Imperfect active<br>
 <b><i>(aorist in <!-#-->Mt 17:5)</i></b> as present participle in <!-#-->Mr 9:7,<br>
 inchoative, the shadow began to come upon them. On Hermon as on<br>
 many high mountains a cloud will swiftly cover the cap. I have<br>
 seen this very thing at Blue Ridge, North Carolina. This same<br>
 verb is used of the Holy Spirit upon Mary <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:35)</i></b>. Nowhere<br>
 else in the N.T., though an old verb <b><i>(\epi, skiaz&#333;\, from \skia\,<br>
 shadow)</i></b>. <B>{As they entered into the cloud}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i eiselthein<br>
 autous eis t&#275;n nephel&#275;n\)</i></b>. Luke's idiom of \en\ with the<br>
 articular infinitive again <b><i>(aorist active this time, on the<br>
 entering in as to them)</i></b>. All six "entered into" the cloud, but<br>
 only Peter, James, and John "became afraid" <b><i>(\ephob&#275;th&#275;san\,<br>
 ingressive first aorist passive)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:35 If \ekeinous\ be accepted here instead of \autous\, the<br>
 three disciples would be outside of the cloud. <B>{Out of the cloud}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ek t&#275;s nephel&#275;s\)</i></b>. This voice was the voice of the Father like<br>
 that at the baptism of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 3:22; Mr 1:11; Mt 3:17)</i></b> and<br>
 like that near the end <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 12:28-30)</i></b> when the people thought<br>
 it was a clap of thunder or an angel. <B>{My son, my chosen}</B> <b><i>(\Ho<br>
 huios mou, ho eklelegmenos\)</i></b>. So the best documents <b><i>(Aleph B L<br>
 Syriac Sinaitic)</i></b>. The others make it "My Beloved" as in <!-#-->Mr 9:7;<br>
 Mt 17:5. These disciples are commanded to hear Jesus, God's Son,<br>
 even when he predicts his death, a pointed rebuke to Simon Peter<br>
 as to all.<br>
 <br>
 9:36 <B>{When the voice came}</B> <b><i>(\en toi genesthai t&#275;n ph&#333;n&#275;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Another example of Luke's idiom, this time with the second aorist<br>
 middle infinitive. Literally, "on the coming as to the voice"<br>
 <b><i>(accusative of general reference)</i></b>. It does not mean that it was<br>
 "after" the voice was past that Jesus was found alone, but<br>
 simultaneously with it <b><i>(ingressive aorist tense)</i></b>. <B>{Alone}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\monos\)</i></b>. Same adjective in <!-#-->Mr 9:8; Mt 17:8 translated "only."<br>
 Should be rendered "alone" there also. <B>{They held their peace}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\esig&#275;san\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist active of common verb \siga&#333;\,<br>
 became silent. In <!-#-->Mr 9:9; Mt 17:9, Jesus commanded them not to<br>
 tell till His Resurrection from the dead. Luke notes that they in<br>
 awe obeyed that command and it turns out that they finally forgot<br>
 the lesson of this night's great experience. By and by they will<br>
 be able to tell them, but not "in those days." <B>{Which they had<br>
 seen}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;n he&#333;rakan\)</i></b>. Attraction of the relative \ha\ into the<br>
 case of the unexpressed antecedent \tout&#333;n\. Perfect active<br>
 indicative \he&#333;rakan\ with _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(papyri)</i></b> form for the ancient<br>
 \he&#333;rak&#257;sin\ changed by analogy to the first aorist ending in<br>
 \-an\ instead of \-asin\.<br>
 <br>
 9:37 <B>{On the next day}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i hex&#275;s h&#275;mer&#257;i\)</i></b>. Alone in Luke. It<br>
 shows that the Transfiguration took place on the preceding night.<br>
 <B>{They were come down}</B> <b><i>(\katelthont&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute<br>
 of second aorist active participle of \katerchomai\, a common<br>
 enough verb, but in the N.T. only in Luke's writings save <!-#-->Jas<br>
 3:15. <B>{Met him}</B> <b><i>(\sun&#275;nt&#275;sen aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. First aorist active of<br>
 \sunanta&#333;\, common compound verb, to meet with, only in Luke's<br>
 writings in the N.T. save <!-#-->Heb 7:1. With associative<br>
 instrumental case \aut&#333;i\.<br>
 <br>
 9:38 <B>{Master}</B> <b><i>(\Didaskale\)</i></b>. Teacher as in <!-#-->Mr 9:17. <B>{Lord}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kurie\, <!-#-->Mt 17:15)</i></b>. <B>{To look upon}</B> <b><i>(\epiblepsai\)</i></b>. Aorist<br>
 active infinitive of \epiblep&#333;\ <b><i>(\epi\, upon, \blep&#333;\, look)</i></b>,<br>
 common verb, but in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Jas 2:3 except <!-#-->Lu<br>
 1:48 in quotation from LXX. This compound verb is common in<br>
 medical writers for examining carefully the patient. <B>{Mine only<br>
 child}</B> <b><i>(\monogen&#275;s moi\)</i></b>. Only in Luke as already about an only<br>
 child in <!-#-->7:12; 8:42.<br>
 <br>
 9:39 <B>{Suddenly}</B> <b><i>(\exephn&#275;s\)</i></b>. Old adverb, but in the N.T. only in<br>
 Luke's writings save <!-#-->Mr 13:36. Used by medical writers of<br>
 sudden attacks of disease like epilepsy. <B>{It teareth him that he<br>
 foameth}</B> <b><i>(\sparassei auton meta aphrou\)</i></b>. Literally, "It tears<br>
 him with <b><i>(accompanied with, \meta\)</i></b> foam" <b><i>(old word, \aphros\,<br>
 only here in the N.T.)</i></b>. From \sparass&#333;\, to convulse, a common<br>
 verb, but in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mr 1:26; 9:26 <b><i>(and<br>
 \sunsparass&#333;\, <!-#-->Mr 9:20)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mr 9:17; Mt 17:15; Lu 9:39 for<br>
 variations in the symptoms in each Gospel. The use of \meta<br>
 aphrou\ is a medical item. <B>{Hardly}</B> <b><i>(\molis\)</i></b>. Late word used in<br>
 place of \mogis\, the old Greek term <b><i>(in some MSS. here)</i></b> and<br>
 alone in Luke's writings in the N.T. save <!-#-->1Pe 4:18; Ro 5:7.<br>
 <B>{Bruising him sorely}</B> <b><i>(\suntribon auton\)</i></b>. Common verb for<br>
 rubbing together, crushing together like chains <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 5:4)</i></b> or as<br>
 a vase <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:3)</i></b>. See on Matthew and Mark for discussion of<br>
 details here.<br>
 <br>
 9:41 <B>{How long shall I be with you and bear with you?}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s<br>
 pote esomai pros hum&#257;s kai anexomai hum&#333;n;\)</i></b>. Here the two<br>
 questions of <!-#-->Mr 9:19 <b><i>(only one in <!-#-->Mt 17:17)</i></b> are combined in<br>
 one sentence. <B>{Bear with}</B> <b><i>(\anexomai\, direct middle future)</i></b> is,<br>
 hold myself from you <b><i>(ablative case \hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. <B>{Faithless}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\apistos\)</i></b> is disbelieving and perverse <b><i>(\diestrammen&#275;\, perfect<br>
 passive participle of \diastreph&#333;\)</i></b>, is twisted, turned, or torn<br>
 in two.<br>
 <br>
 9:42 <B>{As he was yet a coming}</B> <b><i>(\eti proserchomenou autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute. While he was yet coming <b><i>(the boy, that is, not<br>
 Jesus)</i></b>. Note quaint English "a coming" retained in the Revised<br>
 Version. <B>{Dashed him}</B> <b><i>(\err&#275;xen auton\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of \r&#275;gnumi\ or \r&#275;ss&#333;\, to rend or convulse, a common<br>
 verb, used sometimes of boxers giving knockout blows. <B>{Tare<br>
 grievously}</B> <b><i>(\sunesparaxen\)</i></b>. Rare word as only here and <!-#-->Mr<br>
 9:20 in the N.T., which see. <B>{Gave him back to his father}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aped&#333;ken auton t&#333;i patri autou\)</i></b>. Tender touch alone in Luke as<br>
 in <!-#-->7:15. <B>{They were all astonished}</B> <b><i>(\exepl&#275;ssonto de pantes\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect passive of the common verb \ekpl&#275;ss&#333;\ or \ekpl&#275;gnumi\,<br>
 to strike out, a picturesque description of the amazement of all<br>
 at the easy victory of Jesus where the nine disciples had failed.<br>
 <B>{At the majesty of God}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;i megaleiot&#275;ti tou theou\)</i></b>. A<br>
 late word from the adjective \megaleios\ and that from \megas\<br>
 <b><i>(great)</i></b>. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ac 19:27 of Artemis and in<br>
 <!-#-->2Pe 1:16 of the Transfiguration. It came to be used by the<br>
 emperors like our word "Majesty." <B>{Which he did}</B> <b><i>(\hois epoiei\)</i></b>.<br>
 This is one of the numerous poor verse divisions. This sentence<br>
 has nothing to do with the first part of the verse. The imperfect<br>
 active \epoiei\ covers a good deal not told by Luke <b><i>(see <!-#-->Mr<br>
 9:30; Mt 17:22)</i></b>. Note the attraction of the relative <B>{hois}</B> into<br>
 the case of <B>{p&#257;sin}</B>, its antecedent.<br>
 <br>
 9:44 <B>{Sink into your ears}</B> <b><i>(\Thesthe humeis eis ta &#333;ta hum&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist imperative middle of \tith&#275;mi\, common verb. "Do<br>
 you <b><i>(note emphatic position)</i></b> yourselves <b><i>(whatever others do)</i></b> put<br>
 into your ears." No word like "sink" here. The same prediction<br>
 here as in <!-#-->Mr 9:31; Mt 17:22 about the Son of man only without<br>
 mention of death and resurrection as there, which see for<br>
 discussion.<br>
 <br>
 9:45 <B>{It was concealed from them}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n parakekalummenon ap'<br>
 aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Periphrastic past perfect of \parakalupt&#333;\, a common<br>
 verb, but only here in the N.T., to cover up, to hide from. This<br>
 item only in Luke. <B>{That they should not perceive it}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275;<br>
 aisth&#333;ntai auto\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle subjunctive of the common<br>
 verb \aisthanomai\ used with \hina m&#275;\, negative purpose. This<br>
 explanation at least relieves the disciples to some extent of<br>
 full responsibility for their ignorance about the death of Jesus<br>
 as <!-#-->Mr 9:32 observes, as does Luke here that they were afraid to<br>
 ask him. Plummer says, "They were not allowed to understand the<br>
 saying then, in order that they might remember it afterwards, and<br>
 see that Jesus had met His sufferings with full knowledge and<br>
 free will." Perhaps also, if they had fully understood, they<br>
 might have lacked courage to hold on to the end. But it is a hard<br>
 problem.<br>
 <br>
 9:46 <B>{A reasoning}</B> <b><i>(\dialogismos\)</i></b>. A dispute. The word is from<br>
 \dialogizomai\, the verb used in <!-#-->Mr 9:33 about this incident.<br>
 In Luke this dispute follows immediately after the words of Jesus<br>
 about his death. They were afraid to ask Jesus about that<br>
 subject, but <!-#-->Mt 18:1 states that they came to Jesus to settle<br>
 it. <B>{Which of them should be greatest}</B> <b><i>(\to tis an ei&#275; meiz&#333;n<br>
 aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Note the article with the indirect question, the clause<br>
 being in the accusative of general reference. The optative with<br>
 \an\ is here because it was so in the direct question <b><i>(potential<br>
 optative with \an\ retained in the indirect)</i></b>. But Luke makes it<br>
 plain that it was not an abstract problem about greatness in the<br>
 kingdom of heaven as they put it to Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 18:1)</i></b>, but a<br>
 personal problem in their own group. Rivalries and jealousies had<br>
 already come and now sharp words. By and by James and John will<br>
 be bold enough to ask for the first places for themselves in this<br>
 political kingdom which they expect <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 10:35; Mt 20:20)</i></b>. It is<br>
 a sad spectacle.<br>
 <br>
 9:47 <B>{Took a little child}</B> <b><i>(\epilabomenos paidion\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist middle participle of the common verb \epilamban&#333;\.<br>
 Strictly, Taking a little child to himself <b><i>(indirect middle)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr<br>
 9:36 has merely the active \lab&#333;n\ of the simple verb \lamban&#333;\.<br>
 Set him by his side <b><i>(\est&#275;sen auto par' heaut&#333;i\)</i></b>. "In his arms"<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 9:36 has it, "in the midst of them" <!-#-->Mt 18:3 says. All<br>
 three attitudes following one another <b><i>(the disciples probably in<br>
 a circle around Jesus anyhow)</i></b> and now the little child <b><i>(Peter's<br>
 child?)</i></b> was slipped down by the side of Jesus as he gave the<br>
 disciples an object lesson in humility which they sorely needed.<br>
 <br>
 9:48 <B>{This little child}</B> <b><i>(\touto to paidion\)</i></b>. As Jesus spoke he<br>
 probably had his hand upon the head of the child. <!-#-->Mt 18:5 has<br>
 "one such little child." The honoured disciple, Jesus holds, is<br>
 the one who welcomes little children "in my name" <b><i>(\epi t&#333;i<br>
 onomati mou\)</i></b>, upon the basis of my name and my authority. It was<br>
 a home-thrust against the selfish ambition of the Twelve.<br>
 Ministry to children is a mark of greatness. Have preachers ever<br>
 yet learned how to win children to Christ? They are allowed to<br>
 slip away from home, from Sunday school, from church, from<br>
 Christ. <B>{For he that is least among you all}</B> <b><i>(\ho gar mikroteros<br>
 en pasin humin huparch&#333;n\)</i></b>. Note the use of \huparch&#333;\ as in<br>
 <!-#-->8:41; 23:50. The comparative \mikroteros\ is in accord with the<br>
 _Koin&#275;_ idiom where the superlative is vanishing <b><i>(nearly gone in<br>
 modern Greek)</i></b>. But <B>{great}</B> <b><i>(\megas\)</i></b> is positive and very strong.<br>
 This saying peculiar to Luke here.<br>
 <br>
 9:49 <B>{And John answered}</B> <b><i>(\apokritheis de I&#333;an&#275;s\)</i></b>. As if John<br>
 wanted to change the subject after the embarrassment of the<br>
 rebuke for their dispute concerning greatness <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:46-48)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Master}</B> <b><i>(\epistata\)</i></b>. Only in Luke in the N.T. as already four<br>
 times <b><i>(<!-#-->5:5; 8:24,45; 9:33)</i></b>. <B>{We forbade him}</B> <b><i>(\ek&#333;luomen<br>
 auton\)</i></b>. Conative imperfect as in <!-#-->Mr 9:38, We tried to hinder<br>
 him. <B>{Because he followeth not with us}</B> <b><i>(\hoti ouk akolouthei<br>
 meth h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present tense preserved for vividness where Mark<br>
 has imperfect <B>{&#275;kolouthei}</B>. Note also here "with us" <b><i>(\meth'<br>
 h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b> where Mark has associative instrumental \h&#275;min\. It is a<br>
 pitiful specimen of partisan narrowness and pride even in the<br>
 Beloved Disciple, one of the Sons of Thunder. The man was doing<br>
 the Master's work in the Master's name and with the Master's<br>
 power, but did not run with the group of the Twelve.<br>
 <br>
 9:50 <B>{"Against you is for you"}</B> <b><i>(\kath' h&#8211;m&#333;n huper h&#8211;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr<br>
 9:40 has "against us is for us" <b><i>(\h&#275;m&#333;n ... h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. The _Koin&#275;_<br>
 Greek \&#275;\ and \&#8211;\ were often pronounced alike and it was easy to<br>
 interchange them. So many MSS. here read just as in Mark. The<br>
 point is precisely the same as it is a proverbial saying. See a<br>
 similar saying in <!-#-->Lu 11:23: "He that is not with me is against<br>
 me." The prohibition here as in <!-#-->Mr 9:39 is general: "Stop<br>
 hindering him" <b><i>(\m&#275; k&#333;luete, m&#275;\ and the present imperative, not<br>
 \m&#275;\ and the aorist subjunctive)</i></b>. The lesson of toleration in<br>
 methods of work for Christ is needed today.<br>
 <br>
 9:51 <B>{When the days were well-nigh come}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i sumpl&#275;rousthai<br>
 tas h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. Luke's common idiom \en\ with the articular<br>
 infinitive, "in the being fulfilled as to the days." This common<br>
 compound occurs in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 8:23; Ac 2:1. The<br>
 language here makes it plain that Jesus was fully conscious of<br>
 the time of his death as near as already stated <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 9:22,27,31)</i></b>. <B>{That he should be received up}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;s anal&#275;mpse&#333;s<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. Literally, "of his taking up." It is an old word <b><i>(from<br>
 Hippocrates on)</i></b>, but here alone in the N.T. It is derived from<br>
 \analamban&#333;\ <b><i>(the verb used of the Ascension, <!-#-->Ac 1:2,11,22; 1Ti<br>
 3:16)</i></b> and refers here to the Ascension of Jesus after His<br>
 Resurrection. Not only in John's Gospel <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 17:5)</i></b> does Jesus<br>
 reveal a yearning for a return to the Father, but it is in the<br>
 mind of Christ here as evidently at the Transfiguration <b><i>(<!-#-->9:31)</i></b><br>
 and later in <!-#-->Lu 12:49f. <B>{He steadfastly set his face}</B> <b><i>(\autos<br>
 to pros&#333;pon est&#275;risen\)</i></b>. Note emphatic \autos\, <B>{he himself}</B>,<br>
 with fixedness of purpose in the face of difficulty and danger.<br>
 This look on Christ's face as he went to his doom is noted later<br>
 in <!-#-->Mr 10:32. It is a Hebraistic idiom <b><i>(nine times in Ezekiel)</i></b>,<br>
 this use of face here, but the verb <b><i>(effective aorist active)</i></b> is<br>
 an old one from \st&#275;riz&#333;\ <b><i>(from \st&#275;rigx\, a support)</i></b>, to set<br>
 fast, to fix. <B>{To go to Jerusalem}</B> <b><i>(\tou poreuesthai eis<br>
 Ierousal&#275;m\)</i></b>. Genitive infinitive of purpose. Luke three times<br>
 mentions Christ making his way to Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->9:51; 13:22;<br>
 17:11)</i></b> and John mentions three journeys to Jerusalem during the<br>
 later ministry <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 7:10; 11:17; 12:1)</i></b>. It is natural to take<br>
 these journeys to be the same in each of these Gospels. Luke does<br>
 not make definite location of each incident and John merely<br>
 supplements here and there. But in a broad general way they seem<br>
 to correspond.<br>
 <br>
 9:52 <B>{Sent messengers}</B> <b><i>(\apesteilen aggelous\)</i></b>. As a precaution<br>
 since he was going to Jerusalem through Samaria. The Samaritans<br>
 did not object when people went north from Jerusalem through<br>
 their country. He was repudiating Mount Gerizim by going by it to<br>
 Jerusalem. This was an unusual precaution by Jesus and we do not<br>
 know who the messengers <b><i>(<B>{angels}</B>)</i></b> were. <B>{To make ready for him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\h&#333;s hetoimasai aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. \H&#333;s\ is correct here, not \h&#333;ste\. The<br>
 only examples of the final use of \h&#333;s\ with the infinitive in<br>
 the N.T. are this one and <!-#-->Heb 7:9 <b><i>(absolute use)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Acts<br>
 20:24 Westcott and Hort read \h&#333;s telei&#333;s&#333;\ and put \h&#333;s<br>
 telei&#333;sai\ in the margin <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1091)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:53 <B>{And they did not receive him}</B> <b><i>(\kai ouk edexanto auton\)</i></b>.<br>
 Adversative use of \kai\ = But. <B>{Because his face was going to<br>
 Jerusalem}</B> <b><i>(\hoti to pros&#333;pon autou &#275;n poreuomenon eis<br>
 Ierousal&#275;m\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect middle. It was reason enough<br>
 to the churlish Samaritans.<br>
 <br>
 9:54 <B>{Saw this}</B> <b><i>(\idontes\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of<br>
 \hora&#333;\. Saw the messengers returning. <B>{We bid}</B> <b><i>(\theleis<br>
 eip&#333;men\)</i></b>. Deliberative subjunctive \eip&#333;men\ after \theleis\<br>
 without \hina\, probably two questions, Dost thou wish? Shall we<br>
 bid? Perhaps the recent appearance of Elijah on the Mount of<br>
 Transfiguration reminded James and John of the incident in <!-#-->2Ki<br>
 1:10-12. Some MSS. add here "as Elijah did." The language of the<br>
 LXX is quoted by James and John, these fiery Sons of Thunder.<br>
 Note the two aorist active infinitives <b><i>(\katab&#275;nai, anal&#333;sai\,<br>
 the first ingressive, the second effective)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:55 <B>{But he turned}</B> <b><i>(\strapheis de\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive<br>
 participle of \streph&#333;\, common verb, to turn round. Dramatic<br>
 act. Some ancient MSS. have here: <B>{Ye know not what manner of<br>
 spirit ye are of}</B> <b><i>(\ouk oidate poiou pneumatos este\)</i></b>. This<br>
 sounds like Christ and may be a genuine saying though not a part<br>
 of Luke's Gospel. A smaller number of MSS. add also: <B>{For the Son<br>
 of Man came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them}</B> <b><i>(\Ho<br>
 gar huios tou anthr&#333;pou ouk &#275;lthen psuchas anthr&#333;p&#333;n apolesai<br>
 alla s&#333;sai\)</i></b>, a saying reminding us of <!-#-->Mt 5:17; Lu 19:10.<br>
 Certain it is that here Jesus rebuked the bitterness of James and<br>
 John toward Samaritans as he had already chided John for his<br>
 narrowness towards a fellow-worker in the kingdom.<br>
 <br>
 9:57 <B>{A certain man}</B> <b><i>(\tis\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 8:19 calls him "a scribe." <!-#-->Lu<br>
 9:57-60; Mt 8:19-22, but not in Mark and so from Q or the Logia.<br>
 <B>{Wherever you go}</B> <b><i>(\hopou ean aperch&#275;i\)</i></b> is the present middle<br>
 subjunctive with the indefinite relative adverb \ean\, common<br>
 Greek idiom. See on Matthew for "holes," "nests," "Son of man."<br>
 The idiom "where to lay his head" <b><i>(\pou t&#275;n kephal&#275;n klin&#275;i\)</i></b> is<br>
 the same in both, the deliberative subjunctive retained in the<br>
 indirect question. "Jesus knows the measure of the scribe's<br>
 enthusiasm" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. The wandering life of Jesus explains this<br>
 statement.<br>
 <br>
 9:59 <B>{And he said unto another}</B> <b><i>(\eipen de pros heteron\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 8:21 omits Christ's "Follow me" <b><i>(\akolouthei moi\)</i></b> and makes<br>
 this man a volunteer instead of responding to the appeal of<br>
 Jesus. There is no real opposition, of course. In Matthew's<br>
 account the man is apologetic as in Luke. Plummer calls him "one<br>
 of the casual disciples" of whom there are always too many. The<br>
 scribes knew how to give plausible reasons for not being active<br>
 disciples. <B>{First}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;ton\)</i></b>. One of the problems of life is the<br>
 relation of duties to each other, which comes first. The burial<br>
 of one's father was a sacred duty <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 25:9)</i></b>, but, as in the<br>
 case of Tobit 4:3, this scribe's father probably was still alive.<br>
 What the scribe apparently meant was that he could not leave his<br>
 father while still alive to follow Jesus around over the country.<br>
 <br>
 9:60 <B>{Leave the dead to bury their own dead}</B> <b><i>(\aphes tous nekrous<br>
 thapsai tous heaut&#333;n nekrous\)</i></b>. This paradox occurs so in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 8:22. The explanation is that the spiritually dead can bury the<br>
 literally dead. For such a quick change in the use of the same<br>
 words see <!-#-->Joh 5:21-29 <b><i>(spiritual resurrection from sin in <!-#-->Joh<br>
 5:21-27, bodily resurrection from the grave, <!-#-->Joh 5:28,29)</i></b> and<br>
 <!-#-->Joh 11:25f. The harshness of this proverb to the scribe<br>
 probably is due to the fact that he was manifestly using his aged<br>
 father as an excuse for not giving Christ active service. <B>{But go<br>
 thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God}</B> <b><i>(\su de apelth&#333;n<br>
 diaggelle t&#275;n basileian tou theou\)</i></b>. The scribe's duty is put<br>
 sharply <b><i>(\But do thou, su de\)</i></b>. Christ called him to preach, and<br>
 he was using pious phrases about his father as a pretext. Many a<br>
 preacher has had to face a similar delicate problem of duty to<br>
 father, mother, brothers, sisters and the call to preach. This<br>
 was a clear case. Jesus will help any man called to preach to see<br>
 his duty. Certainly Jesus does not advocate renunciation of<br>
 family duties on the part of preachers.<br>
 <br>
 9:61 <B>{And another also said}</B> <b><i>(\eipen de kai heteros\)</i></b>. A<br>
 volunteer like the first. This third case is given by Luke alone,<br>
 though the incident may also come from the same Logia as the<br>
 other two. \Heteros\ does not here mean one of a "different" sort<br>
 as is sometimes true of this pronoun, but merely another like<br>
 \allos\ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 749)</i></b>. <B>{But first}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;ton<br>
 de\)</i></b>. He also had something that was to come "first." <B>{To bid<br>
 farewell to them that are at my house}</B> <b><i>(\apotaxasthai tois eis<br>
 ton oikon mou\)</i></b>. In itself that was a good thing to do. This<br>
 first aorist middle infinitive is from \apotass&#333;\, an old verb,<br>
 to detach, to separate, to assign as a detachment of soldiers. In<br>
 the N.T. it only appears in the middle voice with the meaning<br>
 common in late writers to bid adieu, to separate oneself from<br>
 others. It is used in <!-#-->Ac 18:18 of Paul taking leave of the<br>
 believers in Corinth. See also <!-#-->Mr 6:46; 2Co 2:13. It is thus a<br>
 formal function and this man meant to go home and set things in<br>
 order there and then in due time to come and follow Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 9:62 <B>{Having put his hand to the plough}</B> <b><i>(\epibal&#333;n t&#275;n cheira<br>
 ep' arotron\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of \epiball&#333;\, an<br>
 old and common verb, to place upon. Note repetition of<br>
 preposition \epi\ before \arotron\ <b><i>(plough)</i></b>. This agricultural<br>
 proverb is as old as Hesiod. Pliny observes that the ploughman<br>
 who does not bend attentively to his work goes crooked. It has<br>
 always been the ambition of the ploughman to run a straight<br>
 furrow. The Palestine _fellah_ had good success at it. <B>{And<br>
 looking back}</B> <b><i>(\kai blep&#333;n eis ta opis&#333;\)</i></b>. Looking to the things<br>
 behind. To do that is fatal as any ploughman knows. The call to<br>
 turn back is often urgent. <B>{Fit}</B> <b><i>(\euthetos\)</i></b>. From \eu\ and<br>
 \tith&#275;mi\=well-placed, suited for, adapted to. "The first case is<br>
 that of inconsiderate impulse, the second that of conflicting<br>
 duties, the third that of a divided mind" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
