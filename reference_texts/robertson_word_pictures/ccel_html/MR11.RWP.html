 <HR>
<p>11:1 <B>{Unto Bethphage and Bethany}</B> <b><i>(\eis B&#275;thphag&#275; kai<br>
 B&#275;thanian\)</i></b>. Both together as in <!-#-->Lu 19:29, though <!-#-->Mt 21:1<br>
 mentions only Bethphage. See discussion in Matthew for this and<br>
 the Mount of Olives.<br>
 <br>
 11:2 <B>{As ye enter}</B> <b><i>(\eisporeuomenoi\)</i></b>. So also <!-#-->Lu 19:30.<br>
 Present middle participle. <B>{Colt}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;lon\)</i></b>. So <!-#-->Lu 19:30. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 21:2 speaks of the ass <b><i>(\onon\)</i></b> also. <B>{Whereon no one ever yet<br>
 sat}</B> <b><i>(\eph' hon oudeis anthr&#333;p&#333;n ekathisen\)</i></b>. So <!-#-->Lu 19:30.<br>
 <br>
 11:3 <B>{The Lord}</B> <b><i>(\ho Kurios\)</i></b>. So Matt. and Luke. See on &#175;Mt<br>
 21:3 for discussion of this word applied to Jesus by himself.<br>
 <B>{He will send him back}</B> <b><i>(\apostellei\)</i></b>. Present indicative in<br>
 futuristic sense. <!-#-->Mt 21:3 has the future \apostelei\.<br>
 <br>
 11:4 <B>{A colt tied at the door without in the open street}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;lon<br>
 dedemenon pros thuran ex&#333; epi tou amphodou\)</i></b>. A carefully drawn<br>
 picture. The colt was outside the house in the street, but<br>
 fastened <b><i>(bound, perfect passive participle)</i></b> to the door. "The<br>
 better class of houses were built about an open court, from which<br>
 a passage way under the house led to the street outside. It was<br>
 at this outside opening to the street that the colt was tied"<br>
 <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>. The word \amphodos\ <b><i>(from \amph&#333;\, both, and \hodos\,<br>
 road)</i></b> is difficult. It apparently means road around a thing, a<br>
 crooked street as most of them were <b><i>(cf. Straight Street in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 9:11)</i></b>. It occurs only here in the N.T. besides D in <!-#-->Ac 19:28.<br>
 It is very common in the papyri for _vicus_ or "quarter." <B>{And<br>
 they loose him}</B> <b><i>(\kai luousin auton\)</i></b>. Dramatic present tense.<br>
 Perhaps Peter was one of those sent this time as he was later<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:8)</i></b>. If so, that explains Mark's vivid details here.<br>
 <br>
 11:5 <B>{Certain of those that stood there}</B> <b><i>(\tines t&#333;n ekei<br>
 hest&#275;kot&#333;n\)</i></b>. Perfect active participle, genitive plural.<br>
 Bystanders. <!-#-->Lu 19:33 terms them "the owners thereof" <b><i>(\hoi<br>
 kurioi autou\)</i></b>. The lords or masters of the colt. They make a<br>
 natural protest.<br>
 <br>
 11:7 <B>{They bring the colt unto Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\pherousin ton p&#333;lon pros<br>
 ton I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. Vivid historical present. The owners acquiesced as<br>
 Jesus had predicted. Evidently friends of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 11:8 <B>{Branches}</B> <b><i>(\stibadas\)</i></b>. A litter of leaves and rushes from<br>
 the fields. Textus Receptus spells this word \stoibadas\. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 21:8 has \kladous\, from \kla&#333;\, to break, branches broken or<br>
 cut from trees. <!-#-->Joh 12:13 uses the branches of the palm trees<br>
 <b><i>(\ta baia t&#333;n phoinik&#333;n\)</i></b>, "the feathery fronds forming the<br>
 tufted crown of the tree" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. That is to say, some of the<br>
 crowd did one of these things, some another. See on &#175;Mt 21:4-9<br>
 for discussion of other details. The deliberate conduct of Jesus<br>
 on this occasion could have but one meaning. It was the public<br>
 proclamation of himself as the Messiah, now at last for his<br>
 "hour" has come. The excited crowds in front <b><i>(\hoi proagontes\)</i></b><br>
 and behind <b><i>(\hoi akolouthountes\)</i></b> fully realize the significance<br>
 of it all. Hence their unrestrained enthusiasm. They expect<br>
 Jesus, of course, now to set up his rule in opposition to that of<br>
 Caesar, to drive Rome out of Palestine, to conquer the world for<br>
 the Jews.<br>
 <br>
 11:11 <B>{When he had looked round about upon all things}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\periblepsamenos panta\)</i></b>. Another Markan detail in this aorist<br>
 middle participle. Mark does not give what <!-#-->Lu 19:39-55 has nor<br>
 what <!-#-->Mt 21:10-17 does. But it is all implied in this swift<br>
 glance at the temple before he went out to Bethany with the<br>
 Twelve, <B>{it being now eventide}</B> <b><i>(\opse &#275;d&#275; ous&#275;s t&#275;s h&#333;r&#257;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute, the hour being already late. What a day it had<br>
 been! What did the apostles think now?<br>
 <br>
 11:12 <B>{On the morrow}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i epaurion\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 21:18 has "early"<br>
 <b><i>(\pr&#333;i\)</i></b>, often of the fourth watch before six A.M. This was<br>
 Monday morning. The Triumphal Entry had taken place on our<br>
 Sunday, the first day of the week.<br>
 <br>
 11:13 <B>{If haply he might find anything thereon}</B> <b><i>(\ei ara ti<br>
 heur&#275;sei en aut&#275;i\)</i></b>. This use of \ei\ and the future indicative<br>
 for purpose <b><i>(to see if, a sort of indirect question)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 8:22; 17:27. Jesus was hungry as if he had had no food on the<br>
 night before after the excitement and strain of the Triumphal<br>
 Entry. The early figs in Palestine do not get ripe before May or<br>
 June, the later crop in August. It was not the season of figs,<br>
 Mark notes. But this precocious tree in a sheltered spot had put<br>
 out leaves as a sign of fruit. It had promise without<br>
 performance.<br>
 <br>
 11:14 <B>{No man eat fruit from thee henceforward forever}</B> <b><i>(\M&#275;keti<br>
 eis ton ai&#333;na ek sou m&#275;deis karpon phagoi\)</i></b>. The verb \phagoi\ is<br>
 in the second aorist active optative. It is a wish for the future<br>
 that in its negative form constitutes a curse upon the tree. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 21:19 has the aorist subjunctive with double negative \ou m&#275;keti<br>
 gen&#275;tai\, a very strong negative prediction that amounts to a<br>
 prohibition. See on Matthew. Jesus probably spoke in the Aramaic<br>
 on this occasion. <B>{And his disciples heard it}</B> <b><i>(\kai &#275;kouon hoi<br>
 math&#275;tai autou\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense, "were listening to it," and<br>
 evidently in amazement, for, after all, it was not the fault of<br>
 the poor fig tree that it had put out leaves. One often sees<br>
 peach blossoms nipped by the frost when they are too precocious<br>
 in the changeable weather. But Jesus offered no explanation at<br>
 this time.<br>
 <br>
 11:15 <B>{Began to cast out}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rxato ekballein\)</i></b>. Mark is fond of<br>
 "began." See on &#175;Mt 21:12f. for discussion of this second<br>
 cleansing of the temple in its bearing on that in <!-#-->Joh 2:14f.<br>
 <B>{Money-changers}</B> <b><i>(\kollubist&#333;n\)</i></b>. This same late word in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 21:12 which see for discussion. It occurs in papyri.<br>
 <br>
 11:16 <B>{Through the temple}</B> <b><i>(\dia tou hierou\)</i></b>. The temple<br>
 authorities had prohibited using the outer court of the temple<br>
 through the Precinct as a sort of short cut or by-path from the<br>
 city to the Mount of Olives. But the rule was neglected and all<br>
 sorts of irreverent conduct was going on that stirred the spirit<br>
 of Jesus. This item is given only in Mark. Note the use of \hina\<br>
 after \&#275;phie\ <b><i>(imperfect tense)</i></b> instead of the infinitive <b><i>(the<br>
 usual construction)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:17 <B>{For all the nations}</B> <b><i>(\p&#257;sin tois ethnesin\)</i></b>. Mark alone<br>
 has this phrase from <!-#-->Isa 56:7; Jer 7:11. The people as well as<br>
 the temple authorities were guilty of graft, extortion, and<br>
 desecration of the house of prayer. Jesus assumes and exercises<br>
 Messianic authority and dares to smite this political and<br>
 financial abuse. Some people deny the right of the preacher to<br>
 denounce such abuses in business and politics even when they<br>
 invade the realm of morals and religion. But Jesus did not<br>
 hesitate.<br>
 <br>
 11:18 <B>{Sought how they might destroy him}</B> <b><i>(\ez&#275;toun p&#333;s auton<br>
 apoles&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Imperfect indicative, a continuous attitude and<br>
 endeavour. Note deliberative subjunctive with \p&#333;s\ retained in<br>
 indirect question. Here both Sadducees <b><i>(chief priests)</i></b> and<br>
 Pharisees <b><i>(scribes)</i></b> combine in their resentment against the<br>
 claims of Jesus and in the determination to kill him. Long ago<br>
 the Pharisees and the Herodians had plotted for his death <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 3:6)</i></b>. Now in Jerusalem the climax has come right in the temple.<br>
 <B>{For they feared him}</B> <b><i>(\ephobounto gar\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle<br>
 indicative. Hence in wrath they planned his death and yet they<br>
 had to be cautious. The Triumphal Entry had shown his power with<br>
 the people. And now right in the temple itself "all the multitude<br>
 was astonished at his teaching" <b><i>(\p&#257;s ho ochlos exepl&#275;sseto epi<br>
 t&#275;i didach&#275;i autou\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive. The people looked on<br>
 Jesus as a hero, as the Messiah. This verse aptly describes the<br>
 crisis that has now come between Christ and the Sanhedrin.<br>
 <br>
 11:19 <B>{Every evening}</B> <b><i>(\hotan opse egeneto\)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 <B>{whenever evening came on}</B> or more exactly <B>{whenever it became<br>
 late}</B>. The use of \hotan\ <b><i>(\hote an\)</i></b> with the aorist indicative<br>
 is like \hopou an\ with the imperfect indicative <b><i>(\eiseporeueto\)</i></b><br>
 and \hosoi an\ with the aorist indicative <b><i>(\h&#275;psanto\)</i></b> in <!-#-->Mr<br>
 6:56. The use of \an\ makes the clause more indefinite and<br>
 general, as here, unless it renders it more definite, a curious<br>
 result, but true. <!-#-->Lu 21:37 has the accusative of extent of<br>
 time, "the days," "the nights." The imperfect tense he <b><i>(or they)</i></b><br>
 would go <b><i>(\exeporeueto, exeporeuonto\)</i></b> out of the city suggests<br>
 "whenever" as the meaning here.<br>
 <br>
 11:20 <B>{As they passed by in the morning}</B> <b><i>(\paraporeuomenoi<br>
 pr&#333;i\)</i></b>. Literally, passing by in the morning. The next morning.<br>
 They went back by the lower road up the Mount of Olives and came<br>
 down each morning by the steep and more direct way. Hence they<br>
 saw it. <!-#-->Mt 21:20 does not separate the two mornings as Mark<br>
 does. <B>{From the roots}</B> <b><i>(\ek riz&#333;n\)</i></b>. Mark alone gives this detail<br>
 with \ex&#275;rammen&#275;n\ perfect passive predicate participle from<br>
 \x&#275;rain&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 11:21 <B>{Peter calling to remembrance}</B> <b><i>(\anamn&#275;stheis ho Petros\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist participle, being reminded. Only in Mark and due to<br>
 Peter's story. For his quick memory see also <!-#-->14:72. <B>{Which thou<br>
 cursedst}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;n kat&#275;ras&#333;\)</i></b>. First aorist middle indicative second<br>
 person singular from \kataraomai\. It almost sounds as if Peter<br>
 blamed Jesus for what he had done to the fig tree.<br>
 <br>
 11:22 <B>{Have faith in God}</B> <b><i>(\echete pistin theou\)</i></b>. Objective<br>
 genitive \theou\ as in <!-#-->Gal 2:26; Ro 3:22,26. That was the<br>
 lesson for the disciples from the curse on the fig tree so<br>
 promptly fulfilled. See this point explained by Jesus in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 21:21 which see for "this mountain" also.<br>
 <br>
 11:23 <B>{Shall not doubt in his heart}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; diakrith&#275;i en t&#275;i<br>
 kardi&#257;i autou\)</i></b>. First aorist passive subjunctive with \hos an\.<br>
 The verb means a divided judgment <b><i>(\dia\ from \duo\, two, and<br>
 \krin&#333;\, to judge)</i></b>. Wavering doubt. Not a single act of doubt<br>
 <b><i>(\diakrith&#275;i\)</i></b>, but continued faith <b><i>(\pisteu&#275;i\)</i></b>. <B>{Cometh to<br>
 pass}</B> <b><i>(\ginetai\)</i></b>. Futuristic present middle indicative.<br>
 <br>
 11:24 <B>{Believe that ye have received them}</B> <b><i>(\pisteuete hoti<br>
 elabete\)</i></b>. That is the test of faith, the kind that sees the<br>
 fulfilment before it happens. \Elabete\ is second aorist active<br>
 indicative, antecedent in time to \pisteuete\, unless it be<br>
 considered the timeless aorist when it is simultaneous with it.<br>
 For this aorist of immediate consequence see <!-#-->Joh 15:6.<br>
 <br>
 11:25 <B>{Whensoever ye stand}</B> <b><i>(\hotan st&#275;kete\)</i></b>. Late form of<br>
 present indicative \st&#275;k&#333;\, from perfect stem \hest&#275;ka\. In LXX.<br>
 Note use of \hotan\ as in <!-#-->11:19. Jesus does not mean by the use<br>
 of "stand" here to teach that this is the only proper attitude in<br>
 prayer. <B>{That your Father also may forgive you}</B> <b><i>(\hina kai ho<br>
 pat&#275;r aph&#275;i humin\)</i></b>. Evidently God's willingness to forgive is<br>
 limited by our willingness to forgive others. This is a solemn<br>
 thought for all who pray. Recall the words of Jesus in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 6:12,14f.<br>
 <br>
 11:26 This verse is omitted by Westcott and Hort. The Revised<br>
 Version puts it in a footnote.<br>
 <br>
 11:27 <B>{The chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders}</B> <b><i>(\hoi<br>
 archiereis kai hoi grammateis kai hoi presbuteroi\)</i></b>. Note the<br>
 article with each separate group as in <!-#-->Lu 20:1 and <!-#-->Mt 21:23.<br>
 These three classes were in the Sanhedrin. Clearly a large<br>
 committee of the Sanhedrin including both Sadducees and Pharisees<br>
 here confront Jesus in a formal attack upon his authority for<br>
 cleansing the temple and teaching in it.<br>
 <br>
 11:28 <B>{By what authority}</B> <b><i>(\en poi&#257;i exousi&#257;i\)</i></b>. This question in<br>
 all three Gospels was a perfectly legitimate one. See on &#175;Mt<br>
 21:23-27 for discussion. Note present subjunctive here <b><i>(\hina<br>
 tauta poi&#275;is\)</i></b>, that you keep on doing these things.<br>
 <br>
 11:30 <B>{Answer me}</B> <b><i>(\apokrith&#275;te moi\)</i></b>. This sharp demand for a<br>
 reply is only in Mark. See also verse <!-#-->29. Jesus has a right to<br>
 take this turn because of John's direct relation to himself. It<br>
 was not a dodge, but a home thrust that cleared the air and<br>
 defined their attitude both to John and Jesus. They rejected John<br>
 as they now reject Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 11:31 <B>{If we say}</B> <b><i>(\ean eip&#333;men\)</i></b>. Third-class condition with<br>
 aorist active subjunctive. The alternatives are sharply presented<br>
 in their secret conclave. They see the two horns of the dilemma<br>
 clearly and poignantly. They know only too well what Jesus will<br>
 say in reply. They wish to break Christ's power with the<br>
 multitude, but a false step now will turn the laugh on them. They<br>
 see it.<br>
 <br>
 11:32 <B>{But should we say}</B> <b><i>(\alla eip&#333;men\)</i></b>. Deliberative<br>
 subjunctive with aorist active subjunctive again. It is possible<br>
 to supply \ean\ from verse <!-#-->31 and treat it as a condition as<br>
 there. So <!-#-->Mt 21:26 and <!-#-->Lu 20:6. But in Mark the structure<br>
 continues rugged after "from men" with anacoluthon or even<br>
 aposiopesis--"they feared the people" Mark adds. Matthew has it:<br>
 "We fear the multitude." Luke puts it: "all the people will stone<br>
 us." All three Gospels state the popular view of John as a<br>
 prophet. Mark's "verily" is \ont&#333;s\ really, actually. They feared<br>
 John though dead as much as Herod Antipas did. His martyrdom had<br>
 deepened his power over the people and disrespect towards his<br>
 memory now might raise a storm <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:33 <B>{We know not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk oidamen\)</i></b>. It was for the purpose of<br>
 getting out of the trap into which they had fallen by challenging<br>
 the authority of Jesus. Their self-imposed ignorance, refusal to<br>
 take a stand about the Baptist who was the Forerunner of Christ,<br>
 absolved Jesus from a categorical reply. But he has no notion of<br>
 letting them off at this point.<br>
