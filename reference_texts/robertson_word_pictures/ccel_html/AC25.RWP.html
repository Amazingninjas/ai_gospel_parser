<p>25:1 <B>{Having come into the province}</B> <b><i>(\epibas t&#275;i eparchei&#257;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist active participle of \epibain&#333;\, to set foot upon.<br>
 Literally, "Having set foot upon his province." \Eparcheia\ is a<br>
 late word for province, in N.T. only here and <!-#-->23:34. Judea was<br>
 not strictly a province, but a department <b><i>(Page)</i></b> of the province<br>
 of Syria which was under a _propraetor_ <b><i>(\legatus Caesaris\)</i></b><br>
 while Judea was under a _procurator_ <b><i>(\epitropos\)</i></b>. <B>{After three<br>
 days}</B> <b><i>(\meta treis h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. So in <!-#-->Ac 28:17 in Rome. That is<br>
 on the third day, with a day of rest in between. Precisely the<br>
 language used of the resurrection of Jesus "after three days" =<br>
 "on the third day." So by common usage then and now.<br>
 <br>
 25:2 <B>{The principal men}</B> <b><i>(\hoi pr&#333;toi\)</i></b>. The first men, the<br>
 leading men of the city, besides the chief priests. In verse <!-#-->15<br>
 we have "the chief priests and the elders." These chief men among<br>
 the Jews would desire to pay their respects to the new Procurator<br>
 on his first visit to Jerusalem. There was another high priest<br>
 now, Ishmael in place of Ananias. <B>{Informed him against Paul}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\enephanisan aut&#333;i kata tou Paulou\)</i></b>. "This renewal of the<br>
 charge after two years, on the very first opportunity, is a<br>
 measure, not only of their unsleeping hatred, but of the<br>
 importance which they attached to Paul's influence" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Besought}</B> <b><i>(\parekaloun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, kept on beseeching<br>
 as a special favour to the Jews.<br>
 <br>
 25:3 <B>{Asking favour against him}</B> <b><i>(\aitoumenoi charin kat'<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. A favour to themselves <b><i>(middle voice)</i></b>, not to Paul, but<br>
 "against" <b><i>(\kat'\, down, against)</i></b> him. <B>{That he would send for}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hop&#333;s metapemps&#275;tai\)</i></b>. First aorist middle subjunctive of<br>
 \metapemp&#333;\ <b><i>(see <!-#-->24:24,26)</i></b> with final particle \hop&#333;s\ like<br>
 \hina\. Aorist tense for single case. <B>{Laying wait}</B> <b><i>(\enedran<br>
 poiountes\)</i></b>. See on &#175;23:16 for the word \enedra\. Old idiom<br>
 <b><i>(Thucydides)</i></b> for laying a plot or ambush as here. Only these two<br>
 uses of \enedra\ in N.T. Two years before the Sanhedrin had<br>
 agreed to the plot of the forty conspirators. Now they propose<br>
 one on their own initiative. <B>{On the way}</B> <b><i>(\kata t&#275;n hodon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Down along, up and down along the way. Plenty of opportunity<br>
 would occur between Caesarea and Jerusalem for ambush and<br>
 surprise attacks.<br>
 <br>
 25:4 <B>{Howbeit}</B> <b><i>(\men oun\)</i></b>. No antithesis expressed, though Page<br>
 considers \de\ in verse <!-#-->6 to be one. They probably argued that<br>
 it was easier for one man <b><i>(Paul)</i></b> to come to Jerusalem than for<br>
 many to go down there. But Festus was clearly suspicious <b><i>(verse<br>
 <!-#-->6)</i></b> and was wholly within his rights to insist that they make<br>
 their charges in Caesarea where he held court. <B>{Was kept in<br>
 charge}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;reisthai\)</i></b>. Present passive infinitive of \t&#275;re&#333;\ in<br>
 indirect assertion. \Hoti\ with finite verb is more common after<br>
 \apokrinomai\, but the infinitive with the accusative of general<br>
 reference is proper as here <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1036)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Shortly}</B> <b><i>(\en tachei\)</i></b>. In quickness, in speed. Old and common<br>
 usage, seen already in <!-#-->Lu 18:8; Ac 12:7; 22:18. Festus is<br>
 clearly within his rights again since his stay in Caesarea had<br>
 been so brief. He did go down in "eight or ten days" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->6)</i></b>.<br>
 Luke did not consider the matter important enough to be precise.<br>
 <br>
 25:5 <B>{Them therefore which are of power among you}</B> <b><i>(\hoi oun en<br>
 humin dunatoi\)</i></b>. "The mighty ones among you," "the men of power"<br>
 <b><i>(\dunatoi\)</i></b> and authority, "the first men," the Sanhedrin, in<br>
 other words. Note change here by Luke from indirect discourse in<br>
 verse <!-#-->4, to direct in verse <!-#-->5 <b><i>(\ph&#275;sin\, says he)</i></b>. <B>{Go down<br>
 with me}</B> <b><i>(\sunkatabantes\)</i></b>. Double compound <b><i>(\sun, kata\)</i></b> second<br>
 aorist active participle of \sunkatabain&#333;\. It was a fair<br>
 proposal. <B>{If there is anything amiss in the man}</B> <b><i>(\ei ti estin<br>
 en t&#333;i andri atopon\)</i></b>. Condition of the first class, assuming<br>
 that there is <b><i>(to be courteous to them)</i></b>, but not committing<br>
 himself on the merits of the case. \Atopon\ is an old word,<br>
 specially common in Plato, meaning "out of place." In N.T. only<br>
 here and <!-#-->Lu 23:41 which see; <!-#-->Ac 28:6; 2Th 3:2. Note present<br>
 tense active voice of \kat&#275;goreit&#333;san\ <b><i>(imperative)</i></b> of<br>
 \kat&#275;gore&#333;\, repeat their accusations.<br>
 <br>
 25:6 <B>{On the morrow}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i epaurion\)</i></b>. Locative case of the<br>
 article with \h&#275;mer&#257;i\ understood <b><i>(\epaurion\, adverb, tomorrow)</i></b>.<br>
 Festus lost no time for the chief men had come down with him.<br>
 <B>{Sat on the judgment seat}</B> <b><i>(\kathisas epi tou b&#275;matos\)</i></b>. A legal<br>
 formality to give weight to the decision. Ingressive aorist<br>
 active participle. For this use of \b&#275;ma\ for judgment seat see<br>
 on &#175;Mt. 27:19; Joh 19:13; Acts 12:21; 18:12; 25:10,17. Same<br>
 phrase repeated in <!-#-->25:17. <B>{To be brought}</B> <b><i>(\achth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive infinitive of \ag&#333;\ after \ekeleusen\ <b><i>(commanded)</i></b>.<br>
 Same words repeated in <!-#-->25:17 by Festus.<br>
 <br>
 25:7 <B>{When he was come}</B> <b><i>(\paragenomenou autou\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute of common verb \paraginomai\ <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->24:24)</i></b>. <B>{Which had<br>
 come down}</B> <b><i>(\hoi katabeb&#275;kotes\)</i></b>. Perfect active participle of<br>
 \katabain&#333;\. They had come down on purpose at the invitation of<br>
 Festus <b><i>(verse <!-#-->5)</i></b>, and were now ready. <B>{Stood round about him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\periest&#275;san auton\)</i></b>. Second aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active<br>
 <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b> of \periist&#275;mi\, old verb, "Took their stand<br>
 around him," "_periculum intentantes_" <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Lu 23:10<br>
 about Christ. They have no lawyer this time, but they mass their<br>
 forces so as to impress Festus. <B>{Bringing against him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katapherontes\)</i></b>. Bearing down on. See on &#175;20:9; 26:10, only<br>
 N.T. examples of this ancient verb. <B>{Many and grievous charges}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\polla kai barea aiti&#333;mata\)</i></b>. This word \aiti&#333;ma\ for old form<br>
 \aitiama\ is found in one papyrus <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan's<br>
 _Vocabulary_)</i></b> in sense of "blame." But the charges were no<br>
 "heavier" than those made by Tertullus <b><i>(<!-#-->24:5-8)</i></b>. Paul's reply<br>
 proves this and they were also probably on court record<br>
 <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. See this adjective \barus\ <b><i>(heavy)</i></b> used with \lukoi\<br>
 <b><i>(wolves)</i></b> in <!-#-->20:29. <B>{Which they could not prove}</B> <b><i>(\ha ouk<br>
 ischuon apodeixai\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \ischu&#333;\, to have<br>
 strength or power as in <!-#-->19:16,20. Repetition and reiteration<br>
 and vehemence took the place of proof <b><i>(\apodeixai\, first aorist<br>
 active infinitive of \apodeiknumi\, to show forth, old verb, in<br>
 N.T. only here, <!-#-->Ac 2:22 which see and <!-#-->1Co 4:9)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 25:8 <B>{While Paul said in his defence}</B> <b><i>(\tou Paulou<br>
 apologoumenou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again, present middle<br>
 participle of \apologeomai\, old verb to make defence as in<br>
 <!-#-->19:33; 24:10; 26:1,2. The recitative \hoti\ of the Greek before<br>
 a direct quotation is not reproduced in English. <B>{Have I sinned<br>
 at all}</B> <b><i>(\ti h&#275;marton\)</i></b>. Constative aorist active indicative of<br>
 \hamartan&#333;\, to miss, to sin. The \ti\ is cognate accusative <b><i>(or<br>
 adverbial accusative)</i></b>. Either makes sense. Paul sums up the<br>
 charges under the three items of law of the Jews, the temple, the<br>
 Roman state <b><i>(Caesar)</i></b>. This last was the one that would interest<br>
 Festus and, if proved, would render Paul guilty of treason<br>
 <b><i>(\majestas\)</i></b>. Nero was Emperor A.D. 54-68, the last of the<br>
 emperors with any hereditary claim to the name "Caesar." Soon it<br>
 became merely a title like Kaiser and Czar <b><i>(modern derivatives)</i></b>.<br>
 In Acts only "Caesar" and "Augustus" are employed for the<br>
 Emperor, not "King" <b><i>(\Basileus\)</i></b> as from the time of Domitian.<br>
 Paul's denial is complete and no proof had been presented. Luke<br>
 was apparently present at the trial.<br>
 <br>
 25:9 <B>{Desiring to gain favour with the Jews}</B> <b><i>(\thel&#333;n tois<br>
 Ioudaiois charin katathesthai\)</i></b>. Precisely the expression used of<br>
 Felix by Luke in <!-#-->24:27 which see. Festus, like Felix, falls a<br>
 victim to fear of the Jews. <B>{Before me}</B> <b><i>(\ep' emou\)</i></b>. Same use of<br>
 \epi\ with the genitive as in <!-#-->23:30; 24:19,21. Festus, seeing<br>
 that it was unjust to condemn Paul and yet disadvantageous to<br>
 absolve him <b><i>(Blass)</i></b>, now makes the very proposal to Paul that the<br>
 rulers had made to him in Jerusalem <b><i>(verse <!-#-->3)</i></b>. He added the<br>
 words "\ep' emou\" <b><i>(before me)</i></b> as if to insure Paul of justice.<br>
 If Festus was unwilling to give Paul justice in Caesarea where<br>
 his regular court held forth, what assurance was there that<br>
 Festus would give it to him at Jerusalem in the atmosphere of<br>
 intense hostility to Paul? Only two years ago the mob, the<br>
 Sanhedrin, the forty conspirators had tried to take his life in<br>
 Jerusalem. Festus had no more courage to do right than Felix,<br>
 however plausible his language might sound. Festus also, while<br>
 wanting Paul to think that he would in Jerusalem "be judged of<br>
 these things before me," in reality probably intended to turn<br>
 Paul over to the Sanhedrin in order to please the Jews, probably<br>
 with Festus present also to see that Paul received justice <b><i>(\me<br>
 presente\)</i></b>. Festus possibly was surprised to find that the<br>
 charges were chiefly against Jewish law, though one was against<br>
 Caesar. It was not a mere change of venue that Paul sensed, but<br>
 the utter unwillingness of Festus to do his duty by him and his<br>
 willingness to connive at Jewish vengeance on Paul. Paul had<br>
 faced the mob and the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem, two years of<br>
 trickery at the hands of Felix in Caesarea, and now he is<br>
 confronted by the bland chicanery of Festus. It is too much, the<br>
 last straw.<br>
 <br>
 25:10 <B>{I am standing before Caesar's judgment-seat}</B> <b><i>(\Hest&#333;s epi<br>
 tou b&#275;matos Kaisaros eimi\)</i></b>. Periphrastic present perfect<br>
 indicative <b><i>(\hest&#333;s eimi\)</i></b>, second perfect participle \hest&#333;s\ of<br>
 \hist&#275;mi\ <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b>. Paul means to say that he is a Roman<br>
 citizen before a Roman tribunal. Festus was the representative of<br>
 Caesar and had no right to hand him over to a Jewish tribunal.<br>
 Festus recognized this by saying to Paul "wilt thou" <b><i>(\theleis\)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Where I ought to be judged}</B> <b><i>(\hou me dei krinesthai\)</i></b>. Rather,<br>
 "Where I must be judged," for \dei\ expresses necessity <b><i>(it is<br>
 necessary)</i></b>. Paul exposes the conduct of Festus with merciless<br>
 precision. <B>{As thou also very well knowest}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s kai su kallion<br>
 epigin&#333;skeis\)</i></b>. "As thou also dost understand <b><i>(hast additional<br>
 knowledge, \epigin&#333;skeis\)</i></b> better" <b><i>(than thou art willing to<br>
 admit)</i></b>. That this is Paul's meaning by the use of the comparative<br>
 \kallion\ <b><i>(positive \kal&#333;s\)</i></b> is made plain by the confession of<br>
 Festus to Agrippa in verse <!-#-->18. Paul says that Festus knows that<br>
 he has done no wrong to the Jews at all <b><i>(\ouden &#275;dik&#275;ka\)</i></b> and yet<br>
 he is trying to turn him over to the wrath of the Jews in<br>
 Jerusalem.<br>
 <br>
 25:11 <B>{If I am a wrong-doer}</B> <b><i>(\ei men oun adik&#333;\)</i></b>. Condition of<br>
 the first class with \ei\ and the present active indicative of<br>
 \adike&#333;\ <b><i>(\a\ privative and \dik&#275;\)</i></b>: "If I am in the habit of<br>
 doing injustice," assuming it to be true for the sake of<br>
 argument. <B>{And have committed anything worthy of death}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 axion thanatou pepracha\)</i></b>. Same condition with the difference in<br>
 tense <b><i>(\pepracha\, perfect active indicative)</i></b> of a single case<br>
 instead of a general habit. Assuming either or both Paul draws<br>
 his conclusion. <B>{I refuse not to die}</B> <b><i>(\ou paraitoumai to<br>
 apothanein\)</i></b>. Old verb to ask alongside, to beg from, to<br>
 deprecate, to refuse, to decline. See on &#175;Lu 14:18f. Josephus<br>
 <b><i>(_Life_, 29)</i></b> has \thanein ou paraitoumai\. Here the articular<br>
 second aorist active infinitive is in the accusative case the<br>
 object of \paraitoumai\: "I do not beg off dying from myself."<br>
 <B>{But if none of these things is}</B> <b><i>(\ei de ouden estin\)</i></b>. \De\ here<br>
 is contrasted with \men\ just before. No word for "true" in the<br>
 Greek. \Estin\ <b><i>("is")</i></b> in the Greek here means "exists." Same<br>
 condition <b><i>(first class, assumed as true)</i></b>. <B>{Whereof these accuse<br>
 me}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;n houtoi kat&#275;gorousin mou\)</i></b>. Genitive of relative \hon\<br>
 by attraction from \ha\ <b><i>(accusative with \kat&#275;gorousin\)</i></b> to case<br>
 of the unexpressed antecedent \tout&#333;n\ <b><i>("of these things")</i></b>. \Mou\<br>
 is genitive of person after \kat&#275;gorousin\. <B>{No man can give me<br>
 up to them}</B> <b><i>(\oudeis me dunatai autois charisasthai\)</i></b>. "Can"<br>
 legally. Paul is a Roman citizen and not even Festus can make a<br>
 free gift <b><i>(\charisasthai\)</i></b> of Paul to the Sanhedrin. <B>{I appeal<br>
 unto Caesar}</B> <b><i>(\Kaisara epikaloumai\)</i></b>. Technical phrase like Latin<br>
 _Caesarem appello_. Originally the Roman law allowed an appeal<br>
 from the magistrate to the people <b><i>(_provocatio ad populum_)</i></b>, but<br>
 the emperor represented the people and so the appeal to Caesar<br>
 was the right of every Roman citizen. Paul had crossed the<br>
 Rubicon on this point and so took his case out of the hands of<br>
 dilatory provincial justice <b><i>(really injustice)</i></b>. Roman citizens<br>
 could make this appeal in capital offences. There would be<br>
 expense connected with it, but better that with some hope than<br>
 delay and certain death in Jerusalem. Festus was no better than<br>
 Felix in his vacillation and desire to curry favour with the Jews<br>
 at Paul's expense. No doubt Paul's long desire to see Rome<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->19:21; Ro 15:22-28)</i></b> and the promise of Jesus that he would see<br>
 Rome <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 23:11)</i></b> played some part in Paul's decision. But he<br>
 made it reluctantly for he says in Rome <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 28:19)</i></b>: "I was<br>
 constrained to appeal." But acquittal at the hands of Festus with<br>
 the hope of going to Rome as a free man had vanished.<br>
 <br>
 25:12 <B>{When he had conferred with the council}</B> <b><i>(\sunlal&#275;sas meta<br>
 tou sumbouliou\)</i></b>. The word \sumboulion\ in the N.T. usually means<br>
 "counsel" as in <!-#-->Mt 12:14, but here alone as an assembly of<br>
 counsellors or council. But the papyri <b><i>(Milligan and Moulton's<br>
 _Vocabulary_)</i></b> furnish a number of instances of this sense of the<br>
 word as "council." Here it apparently means the chief officers<br>
 and personal retinue of the procurator, his assessors<br>
 <b><i>(\assessores consiliarii\)</i></b>. These local advisers were a<br>
 necessity. Some discretion was allowed the governor about<br>
 granting the appeal. If the prisoner were a well-known robber or<br>
 pirate, it could be refused. <B>{Thou hast appealed unto Caesar}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Kaisara epikekl&#275;sai\)</i></b>. The same technical word, but the perfect<br>
 tense of the indicative. <B>{Unto Caesar thou shalt go}</B> <b><i>(\epi<br>
 Kaisara poreus&#275;i\)</i></b>. Perhaps the volitive future <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 874)</i></b>. Bengel thinks that Festus sought to frighten<br>
 Paul with these words. Knowling suggests that "they may have been<br>
 uttered, if not with a sneer, yet with the implication 'thou<br>
 little knowest what an appeal to Caesar means.'" But<br>
 embarrassment will come to Festus. He has refused to acquit this<br>
 prisoner. Hence he must formulate charges against him to go<br>
 before Caesar.<br>
 <br>
 25:13 <B>{When certain days were passed}</B> <b><i>(\H&#275;mer&#333;n diagenomenon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute of \diaginomai\, to come between, "days<br>
 intervening." <B>{Agrippa the King}</B> <b><i>(\Agrippas ho basileus\)</i></b>.<br>
 Agrippa II son of Agrippa I of <!-#-->Ac 12:20-23. On the death of<br>
 Herod King of Chalcis A.D. 48, Claudius A.D. 50 gave this Herod<br>
 Agrippa II the throne of Chalcis so that Luke is correct in<br>
 calling him king, though he is not king of Judea. But he was also<br>
 given by Claudius the government of the temple and the right of<br>
 appointing the high priest. Later he was given also the<br>
 tetrarchies of Philip and Lysanias. He was the last Jewish king<br>
 in Palestine, though not king of Judea. He angered the Jews by<br>
 building his palace so as to overlook the temple and by frequent<br>
 changes in the high priesthood. He made his capital at Caesarea<br>
 Philippi which he called Neronias in honour of Nero. Titus<br>
 visited it after the fall of Jerusalem. <B>{Bernice}</B> <b><i>(\Bernik&#275;\)</i></b>. He<br>
 was her brother and yet she lived with him in shameful intimacy<br>
 in spite of her marriage to her uncle Herod King of Chalcis and<br>
 to Polemon King of Cilicia whom she left. Schuerer calls her both<br>
 a Jewish bigot and a wanton. She afterwards became the mistress<br>
 of Titus. <B>{Arrived at Caesarea}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;nt&#275;san eis Kaisarian\)</i></b>.<br>
 Came down <b><i>(first aorist active of \katanta&#333;\)</i></b> to Caesarea from<br>
 Jerusalem. <B>{And saluted Festus}</B> <b><i>(\aspasamenoi ton Ph&#275;ston\)</i></b>. The<br>
 Textus Receptus has \aspasomenoi\ the future participle, but the<br>
 correct text is the aorist middle participle \aspasamenoi\ which<br>
 cannot possibly mean subsequent action as given in the Canterbury<br>
 Revision "and saluted." It can only mean contemporaneous<br>
 <b><i>(simultaneous)</i></b> action "saluting" or antecedent action like the<br>
 margin "having saluted." But antecedent action is not possible<br>
 here, so that simultaneous action is the only alternative. It is<br>
 to be noted that the salutation synchronized with the arrival in<br>
 Caesarea <b><i>(note \kata\, down, the effective aorist tense)</i></b>, not<br>
 with the departure from Jerusalem, nor with the whole journey.<br>
 Rightly understood the aorist participle here gives no trouble at<br>
 all <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 861-3)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 25:14 <B>{Tarried}</B> <b><i>(\dietribon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \diatrib&#333;\,<br>
 common verb for spending time <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 12:19, etc.)</i></b>. <B>{Many days}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pleious h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. More days <b><i>(than a few)</i></b>. Accusative case for<br>
 extent of time. <B>{Laid Paul's case}</B> <b><i>(\anetheto ta kata ton<br>
 Paulon\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle indicative of \anatith&#275;mi\, old<br>
 verb to set before, to place up, as if for consultation in<br>
 conference. Only twice in N.T. here and <!-#-->Ga 2:2. The motive of<br>
 Festus is not given, though it was natural enough in view of the<br>
 quandary of Festus about Paul <b><i>(the things about Paul)</i></b> and<br>
 Agrippa's interest in and responsibility for Jewish worship in<br>
 the temple in Jerusalem. It is quite possible that Festus had a<br>
 bit of \ennui\ over the visit of these Jewish dignitaries as<br>
 "more days" went by. Hence the tone of Festus about Paul in this<br>
 proposal for the entertainment of Agrippa and Bernice is<br>
 certainly one of superficial and supremely supercilious<br>
 indifference. <B>{Left a prisoner}</B> <b><i>(\katalelimmenos desmios\)</i></b>.<br>
 Perfect passive participle of \kataleip&#333;\, to leave behind. Paul<br>
 is one of Felix's left overs <b><i>(left behind)</i></b>, a sort of "junk" left<br>
 on his hands. This cowardly Roman procurator thus pictures the<br>
 greatest of living men and the greatest preacher of all time to<br>
 this profligate pair <b><i>(brother and sister)</i></b> of sinners. Undoubtedly<br>
 today in certain circles Christ and his preachers are held up to<br>
 like contempt.<br>
 <br>
 25:15 <B>{Informed}</B> <b><i>(\enephanisan\)</i></b>. Same word as in <!-#-->23:15,22;<br>
 25:2 which see. <B>{Asking for sentence against him}</B> <b><i>(\aitoumenoi<br>
 kat' autou katadik&#275;n\)</i></b>. Only N.T. example of this old word<br>
 <b><i>(penalty, fine, condemnation)</i></b> from \kata\ and \dik&#275;\ <b><i>(justice<br>
 against)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 25:16 <B>{It is not the custom of the Romans}</B> <b><i>(\hoti ouk estin ethos<br>
 R&#333;maiois\)</i></b>. If a direct quotation, \hoti\ is recitative as in<br>
 Authorized Version. Canterbury Revision takes it as indirect<br>
 discourse after \apekrith&#275;n\ <b><i>(I answered)</i></b>, itself in a relative<br>
 clause <b><i>(\pros hous\)</i></b> with the present tense <b><i>(\estin\, is)</i></b><br>
 preserved as is usual. There is a touch of disdain <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b> in<br>
 the tone of Festus. He may refer to a demand of the Jews before<br>
 they asked that Paul be brought to Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->25:3)</i></b>. At any<br>
 rate there is a tone of scorn towards the Jews. <B>{Before that the<br>
 accused have}</B> <b><i>(\prin &#275; ho kat&#275;goroumenos echoi\)</i></b>. This use of the<br>
 optative in this temporal clause with \prin &#275;\ instead of the<br>
 subjunctive \an ech&#275;i\ is in conformity with literary Greek and<br>
 occurs only in Luke's writings in the N.T. <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_,<br>
 p. 970)</i></b>. This sequence of modes is a mark of the literary style<br>
 occasionally seen in Luke. It is interesting here to note the<br>
 succession of dependent clauses in verses <!-#-->14-16. <B>{The accusers<br>
 face to face}</B> <b><i>(\kata pros&#333;pon tous kat&#275;gorous\)</i></b>. Same word<br>
 \kat&#275;goros\ as in <!-#-->23:30,35; 25:18. This all sounds fair enough.<br>
 <B>{And have had opportunity to make his defence concerning the<br>
 matter laid against him}</B> <b><i>(\topon te apologias laboi peri tou<br>
 egkl&#275;matos\)</i></b>. Literally, "And should receive <b><i>(\laboi\ optative<br>
 for same reason as \echoi\ above, second aorist active of<br>
 \lamban&#333;\)</i></b> opportunity for defence <b><i>(objective genitive)</i></b><br>
 concerning the charge" <b><i>(\egkl&#275;matos\ in N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->23:19 which see)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 25:17 <B>{When they were come together here}</B> <b><i>(\sunelthont&#333;n<br>
 enthade\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute of second aorist active participle<br>
 of \sunerchomai\, but without \aut&#333;n\ <b><i>(they)</i></b>, merely understood.<br>
 <B>{Delay}</B> <b><i>(\anabol&#275;n\)</i></b>. Old word from \anaball&#333;\, only here in N.T.<br>
 <br>
 25:18 <B>{Brought}</B> <b><i>(\epheron\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \pher&#333;\,<br>
 referring to their repeated charges. <B>{Of such evil things as I<br>
 supposed}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;n eg&#333; hupenooun pon&#275;r&#333;n\)</i></b>. Incorporation of the<br>
 antecedent \pon&#275;r&#333;n\ into the relative clause and change of the<br>
 case of the relative from the accusative \ha\ object of<br>
 \hupenooun\ to the genitive like \pon&#275;r&#333;n\ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_,<br>
 p. 719)</i></b>. Note the imperfect active \hupenooun\ of \huponoe&#333;\ to<br>
 emphasize Festus's state of mind about Paul before the trial.<br>
 This old verb only three times in the N.T. <b><i>(here, <!-#-->Ac 13:25<br>
 which see; <!-#-->27:27)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 25:19 <B>{But had}</B> <b><i>(\de eichon\)</i></b>. Descriptive imperfect active of<br>
 \ech&#333;\ and \de\ of contrast <b><i>(but)</i></b>. <B>{Concerning their own<br>
 religion}</B> <b><i>(\peri t&#275;s idias deisidaimonias\)</i></b>. See on &#175;17:22 for<br>
 discussion of this word. Festus would hardly mean "superstition,"<br>
 whatever he really thought, because Agrippa was a Jew. <B>{And of<br>
 one Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\kai peri tinos I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. This is the climax of<br>
 supercilious scorn toward both Paul and "one Jesus." <B>{Who was<br>
 dead}</B> <b><i>(\tethn&#275;kotos\)</i></b>. Perfect active participle of \thn&#275;sk&#333;\<br>
 agreeing with \I&#275;sou\ <b><i>(genitive)</i></b>. As being dead. <B>{Whom Paul<br>
 affirmed to be alive}</B> <b><i>(\hon ephasken ho Paulos z&#275;in\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active of \phask&#333;\, old form of \ph&#275;mi\ to say, in the N.T. only<br>
 here and <!-#-->Ac 24:9; Ro 1:22. Infinitive \z&#275;in\ in indirect<br>
 discourse with \hon\ <b><i>(whom)</i></b> the accusative of general reference.<br>
 With all his top-loftical airs Festus has here correctly stated<br>
 the central point of Paul's preaching about Jesus as no longer<br>
 dead, but living.<br>
 <br>
 25:20 <B>{Being perplexed}</B> <b><i>(\aporoumenos\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 participle of the common verb \apore&#333;\ <b><i>(\a\ privative and \poros\<br>
 way)</i></b>, to be in doubt which way to turn, already in <!-#-->Mr 6:20<br>
 which see and <!-#-->Lu 24:4. The Textus Receptus has \eis\ after<br>
 here, but critical text has only the accusative which this verb<br>
 allows <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 6:20)</i></b> as in Thucydides and Plato. <B>{How to inquire<br>
 concerning these things}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n peri tout&#333;n z&#275;t&#275;sin\)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 "as to the inquiry concerning these things." This is not the<br>
 reason given by Luke in verse <!-#-->9 <b><i>(wanting to curry favour with<br>
 the Jews)</i></b>, but doubtless this motive also actuated Festus as both<br>
 could be true. <B>{Whether he would go to Jerusalem}</B> <b><i>(\ei bouloito<br>
 poreuesthai eis Ierosoluma\)</i></b>. Optative in indirect question after<br>
 \elegon\ <b><i>(asked or said)</i></b> imperfect active, though the present<br>
 indicative could have been retained with change of person: "Dost<br>
 thou wish, etc.," <b><i>(\ei boul&#275;i\, etc.)</i></b>. See Robertson, _Grammar_,<br>
 pp. 1031, 1044. This is the question put to Paul in verse <!-#-->9<br>
 though \theleis\ is there used.<br>
 <br>
 25:21 <B>{When Paul had appealed}</B> <b><i>(\tou Paulou epikalesamenou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute with first aorist middle participle of<br>
 \epikaleomai\, the technical word for appeal <b><i>(verses <!-#-->11,12)</i></b>.<br>
 The first aorist passive infinitive \t&#275;r&#275;th&#275;nai\ <b><i>(to be kept)</i></b> is<br>
 the object of the participle. <B>{For the decision of the emperor}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n tou Sebastou diagn&#333;sin\)</i></b>. \Diagn&#333;sin\ <b><i>(cf.<br>
 \diagn&#333;somai\ <!-#-->24:22, I will determine)</i></b> is the regular word for<br>
 a legal examination <b><i>(\cognitio\)</i></b>, thorough sifting <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b>, here<br>
 only in N.T. Instead of "the Emperor" it should be "the<br>
 Augustus," as \Sebastos\ is simply the Greek translation of<br>
 _Augustus_, the adjective <b><i>(Revered, Reverent)</i></b> assumed by Octavius<br>
 B.C. 27 as the \agnomen\ that summed up all his various offices<br>
 instead of _Rex_ so offensive to the Romans having led to the<br>
 death of Julius Caesar. The successors of Octavius assumed<br>
 _Augustus_ as a title. The Greek term \Sebastos\ has the notion<br>
 of worship <b><i>(cf. \sebasma\ in Acts <!-#-->17:25)</i></b>. In the N.T. only<br>
 here, verse <!-#-->25; 27:1 <b><i>(of the legion)</i></b>. It was more imposing than<br>
 "Caesar" which was originally a family name <b><i>(always official in<br>
 the N.T.)</i></b> and it fell in with the tendency toward emperor-worship<br>
 which later played such a large part in Roman life and which<br>
 Christians opposed so bitterly. China is having a revival of this<br>
 idea in the insistence on bowing three times to the picture of<br>
 Sun-Yat-Sen. <B>{Till I should send him to Caesar}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s an<br>
 anapemps&#333; auton pros Kaisara\)</i></b>. Here \anapemps&#333;\ can be either<br>
 future indicative or first aorist subjunctive <b><i>(identical in first<br>
 person singular)</i></b>, aorist subjunctive the usual construction with<br>
 \he&#333;s\ for future time <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 876)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 "send up" <b><i>(\ana\)</i></b> to a superior <b><i>(the emperor)</i></b>. Common in this<br>
 sense in the papyri and _Koin&#275;_ writers. Here "Caesar" is used as<br>
 the title of Nero instead of "Augustus" as \Kurios\ <b><i>(Lord)</i></b> occurs<br>
 in verse <!-#-->26.<br>
 <br>
 25:22 <B>{I also could wish}</B> <b><i>(\eboulom&#275;n kai autos\)</i></b>. The imperfect<br>
 for courtesy, rather than the blunt \boulomai\, I wish, I want.<br>
 Literally, "I myself also was wishing" <b><i>(while you were talking)</i></b>,<br>
 a compliment to the interesting story told by Festus. The use of<br>
 \an\ with the imperfect would really mean that he does not wish<br>
 <b><i>(a conclusion of the second class condition, determined as<br>
 unfulfilled)</i></b>. \An\ with the optative would show only a languid<br>
 desire. The imperfect is keen enough and yet polite enough to<br>
 leave the decision with Festus if inconvenient for any reason<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 885-7)</i></b>. Agrippa may have heard much<br>
 about Christianity.<br>
 <br>
 25:23 <B>{When Agrippa was come and Bernice}</B> <b><i>(\elthontos tou Agrippa<br>
 kai t&#275;s Bernik&#275;s\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute, the participle agreeing in<br>
 number and gender <b><i>(masculine singular, \elthontos\)</i></b> with<br>
 \Agrippa\, \Bernik&#275;s\ being added as an afterthought. <B>{With great<br>
 pomp}</B> <b><i>(\meta poll&#275;s phantasias\)</i></b>. \Phantasia\ is a _Koin&#275;_ word<br>
 <b><i>(Polybius, Diodorus, etc.)</i></b> from the old verb \phantaz&#333;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb<br>
 12:21)</i></b> and it from \phain&#333;\, common verb to show, to make an<br>
 appearance. This is the only N.T. example of \phantasia\, though<br>
 the kindred common word \phantasma\ <b><i>(appearance)</i></b> occurs twice in<br>
 the sense of apparition or spectre <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 14:26; Mr 6:49)</i></b>.<br>
 Herodotus <b><i>(VII. 10)</i></b> used the verb \phantaz&#333;\ for a showy parade.<br>
 Festus decided to gratify the wish of Agrippa by making the<br>
 "hearing" of Paul the prisoner <b><i>(verse <!-#-->22)</i></b> an occasion for<br>
 paying a compliment to Agrippa <b><i>(Rackham)</i></b> by a public gathering of<br>
 the notables in Caesarea. Festus just assumed that Paul would<br>
 fall in with this plan for a grand entertainment though he did<br>
 not have to do it. <B>{Into the place of hearing}</B> <b><i>(\eis to<br>
 akroat&#275;rion\)</i></b>. From \akroaomai\ <b><i>(to be a hearer)</i></b> and, like the<br>
 Latin _auditorium_, in Roman law means the place set aside for<br>
 hearing, and deciding cases. Here only in the N.T. Late word,<br>
 several times in Plutarch and other _Koin&#275;_ writers. The hearing<br>
 was "semi-official" <b><i>(Page)</i></b> as is seen in verse <!-#-->26. <B>{With the<br>
 chief captains}</B> <b><i>(\sun te chiliarchois\)</i></b>. \Chiliarchs\, each a<br>
 leader of a thousand. There were five cohorts of soldiers<br>
 stationed in Caesarea. <B>{And the principal men of the city}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 andrasin tois kat' exoch&#275;n\)</i></b>. The use of \kat' exoch&#275;n\, like our<br>
 French phrase _par excellence_, occurs here only in the N.T., and<br>
 not in the ancient Greek, but it is found in inscriptions of the<br>
 first century A.D. <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan's _Vocabulary_)</i></b>.<br>
 \Exoch&#275;\ in medical writers is any protuberance or swelling. Cf.<br>
 our phrase "outstanding men." <B>{At the command of Festus}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\keleusantos tou Ph&#275;stou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again, "Festus<br>
 having commanded."<br>
 <br>
 25:24 <B>{Which are here present with us}</B> <b><i>(\hoi sunparontes h&#275;min\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present articular participle of \sunpareimi\ <b><i>(only here in N.T.)</i></b><br>
 with associative instrumental case \h&#275;min\. <B>{Made suit to me}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\enetuchon moi\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative of<br>
 \entugchan&#333;\, old verb to fall in with a person, to go to meet<br>
 for consultation or supplication as here. Common in old Greek and<br>
 _Koin&#275;_. Cf. <!-#-->Ro 8:27,34. See \enteuxis\ <b><i>(petition)</i></b> <!-#-->1Ti 2:1.<br>
 Papyri give many examples of the technical sense of \enteuxis\ as<br>
 petition <b><i>(Deissmann, _Bible Studies_, p. 121)</i></b>. Some MSS. have<br>
 plural here \enetuchon\ rather than the singular \enetuchen\.<br>
 <B>{Crying}</B> <b><i>(\bo&#333;ntes\)</i></b>. Yelling and demanding with loud voices.<br>
 <B>{That he ought not to live any longer}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; dein auton z&#275;in<br>
 m&#275;keti\)</i></b>. Indirect command <b><i>(demand)</i></b> with the infinitive \dein\<br>
 for \dei\ <b><i>(it is necessary)</i></b>. The double negative <b><i>(\m&#275;--m&#275;keti\)</i></b><br>
 with \z&#275;in\ intensifies the demand.<br>
 <br>
 25:25 <B>{But I found}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; de katelabom&#275;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle<br>
 of \katalamban&#333;\, to lay hold of, to grasp, to comprehend as in<br>
 <!-#-->4:13; 10:34. <B>{That he had committed nothing worthy of death}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275;den axion auton thanatou peprachenai\)</i></b>. Perfect active<br>
 infinitive of \prass&#333;\ in indirect assertion with negative \m&#275;\<br>
 and accusative \auton\ of general reference, the usual idiom.<br>
 Verse <!-#-->25 repeats the statement in verse <!-#-->21, perhaps for the<br>
 benefit of the assembled dignitaries.<br>
 <br>
 25:26 <B>{No certain thing}</B> <b><i>(\asphales ti--ou\)</i></b>. Nothing definite or<br>
 reliable <b><i>(\a\ privative, \sphall&#333;\, to trip)</i></b>. All the charges of<br>
 the Sanhedrin slipped away or were tripped up by Paul. Festus<br>
 confesses that he had nothing left and thereby convicts himself<br>
 of gross insincerity in his proposal to Paul in verse <!-#-->9 about<br>
 going up to Jerusalem. By his own statement he should have set<br>
 Paul free. The various details here bear the marks of the<br>
 eyewitness. Luke was surely present and witnessed this grand<br>
 spectacle with Paul as chief performer. <B>{Unto my lord}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i<br>
 kuri&#333;i\)</i></b>. Augustus <b><i>(Octavius)</i></b> and Tiberius refused the title of<br>
 \kurios\ <b><i>(lord)</i></b> as too much like _rex_ <b><i>(king)</i></b> and like master and<br>
 slave, but the servility of the subjects gave it to the other<br>
 emperors who accepted it <b><i>(Nero among them)</i></b>. Antoninus Pius put it<br>
 on his coins. Deissmann <b><i>(_Light from the Ancient East_, p. 105)</i></b><br>
 gives an ostracon dated Aug. 4, A.D. 63 with the words "in the<br>
 year nine of Nero the lord" <b><i>(\enatou Ner&#333;nos tou kuriou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Deissmann <b><i>(_op. cit._, pp. 349ff.)</i></b> runs a most interesting<br>
 parallel "between the cult of Christ and the cult of Caesar in<br>
 the application of the term \kurios\, lord" in ostraca, papyri,<br>
 inscriptions. Beyond a doubt Paul has all this fully in mind when<br>
 he says in <!-#-->1Co 12:3 that "no one is able to say \Kurios I&#275;sous\<br>
 except in the Holy Spirit" <b><i>(cf. also <!-#-->Php 2:11)</i></b>. The Christians<br>
 claimed this word for Christ and it became the test in the Roman<br>
 persecutions as when Polycarp steadily refused to say " Lord<br>
 Caesar" and insisted on saying "Lord Jesus" when it meant his<br>
 certain death. <B>{Before you}</B> <b><i>(\eph' hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. The whole company. In<br>
 no sense a new trial, but an examination in the presence of these<br>
 prominent men to secure data and to furnish entertainment and<br>
 pleasure to Agrippa <b><i>(verse <!-#-->22)</i></b>. <B>{Especially before thee}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\malista epi sou\)</i></b>. Out of courtesy. It was the main reason as<br>
 verse <!-#-->22 shows. Agrippa was a Jew and Festus was glad of the<br>
 chance to see what he thought of Paul's case. <B>{After examination<br>
 had}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;s anakrise&#333;s genomen&#275;s\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute, "the<br>
 examination having taken place." \Anakrisis\ from \anakrin&#333;\ <b><i>(cf.<br>
 <!-#-->12:19; 24:8; 28:18)</i></b> is a legal term for preliminary<br>
 examination. Only here in the N.T. Inscriptions and papyri give<br>
 it as examination of slaves or other property. <B>{That I may have<br>
 somewhat to write}</B> <b><i>(\hop&#333;s sch&#333; ti graps&#333;\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist<br>
 subjunctive \sch&#333;\ <b><i>(may get)</i></b> with \hop&#333;s\ <b><i>(final particle like<br>
 \hina\)</i></b>. \Ti graps&#333;\ in indirect question after \sch&#333;\ is either<br>
 future indicative or aorist subjunctive <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 1045)</i></b>. Festus makes it plain that this is not a "trial," but an<br>
 examination for his convenience to help him out of a predicament.<br>
 <br>
 25:27 <B>{Unreasonable}</B> <b><i>(\alogon\)</i></b>. Old word from \a\ privative and<br>
 \logos\ <b><i>(reason, speech)</i></b>. "Without reason" as of animals <b><i>(<!-#-->Jude<br>
 1:10; 2Pe 2:12)</i></b>, "contrary to reason" here. These the only N.T.<br>
 instances and in harmony with ancient usage. <B>{In sending}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pemponta\)</i></b>. Note accusative case with the infinitive \s&#275;m&#257;nai\<br>
 though \moi\ <b><i>(dative)</i></b> just before. Cf. same variation in<br>
 <!-#-->15:22f.; 22:17. <B>{Signify}</B> <b><i>(\s&#275;m&#257;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 infinitive <b><i>(not \s&#275;m&#275;nai\, the old form)</i></b> of \s&#275;main&#333;\, to give a<br>
 sign <b><i>(\s&#275;meion\)</i></b>. <B>{The charges}</B> <b><i>(\tas aitias\)</i></b>. This naive<br>
 confession of Festus reveals how unjust has been his whole<br>
 treatment of Paul. He had to send along with the appeal of Paul<br>
 _litterae dimissoriae_ <b><i>(\apostoli\)</i></b> which would give a statement<br>
 of the case <b><i>(Page)</i></b>.<br>
