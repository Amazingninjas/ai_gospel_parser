<p>22:1 <B>{Again in parables}</B> <b><i>(\palin en parabolais\)</i></b>. Matthew has<br>
 already given two on this occasion <b><i>(The Two Sons, The Wicked<br>
 Husbandmen)</i></b>. He alone gives this Parable of the Marriage Feast of<br>
 the King's Son. It is somewhat similar to that of The Supper in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 14:16-23 given on another occasion. Hence some scholars<br>
 consider this merely Matthew's version of the Lucan parable in<br>
 the wrong place because of Matthew's habit of grouping the<br>
 sayings of Jesus. But that is a gratuitous indictment of<br>
 Matthew's report which definitely locates the parable here by<br>
 \palin\. Some regard it as not spoken by Jesus at all, but an<br>
 effort on the part of the writer to cover the sin and fate of the<br>
 Jews, the calling of the Gentiles, and God's demand for<br>
 righteousness. But here again it is like Jesus and suits the<br>
 present occasion.<br>
 <br>
 22:2 <B>{A marriage feast}</B> <b><i>(\gamous\)</i></b>. The plural, as here<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2,3,4,9)</i></b>, is very common in the papyri for the wedding<br>
 festivities <b><i>(the several acts of feasting)</i></b> which lasted for days,<br>
 seven in <!-#-->Jud 14:17. The very phrase here, \gamous poiein\,<br>
 occurs in the Doric of Thera about B.C. 200. The singular \gamos\<br>
 is common in the papyri for the wedding contract, but Field<br>
 <b><i>(_Notes_, p. 16)</i></b> sees no difference between the singular here in<br>
 <!-#-->22:8 and the plural <b><i>(see also <!-#-->Ge 29:22; Es 9:22; Macc.<br>
 10:58)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:3 <B>{To call them that were bidden}</B> <b><i>(\kalesai tous<br>
 kekl&#275;menous\)</i></b>. "Perhaps an unconscious play on the words, lost in<br>
 both A.V. and Rev., <B>{to call the called}</B>" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. It was a<br>
 Jewish custom to invite a second time the already invited <b><i>(<!-#-->Es<br>
 5:8; 6:14)</i></b>. The prophets of old had given God's invitation to<br>
 the Jewish people. Now the Baptist and Jesus had given the second<br>
 invitation that the feast was ready. <B>{And they would not come}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai ouk &#275;thelon elthein\)</i></b>. This negative imperfect<br>
 characterizes the stubborn refusal of the Jewish leaders to<br>
 accept Jesus as God's Son <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:11)</i></b>. This is "The Hebrew<br>
 Tragedy" <b><i>(Conder)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:4 <B>{My dinner}</B> <b><i>(\to ariston mou\)</i></b>. It is breakfast, not dinner.<br>
 In <!-#-->Lu 14:12 both \ariston\ <b><i>(breakfast)</i></b> and \deipnon\ <b><i>(dinner)</i></b><br>
 are used. This noon or midday meal, like the French breakfast at<br>
 noon, was sometimes called \deipnon mes&#275;mbrinon\ <b><i>(midday dinner<br>
 or luncheon)</i></b>. The regular dinner <b><i>(\deipnon\)</i></b> came in the evening.<br>
 The confusion arose from applying \ariston\ to the early morning<br>
 meal and then to the noon meal <b><i>(some not eating an earlier meal)</i></b>.<br>
 In <!-#-->Joh 21:12,15 \arista&#333;\ is used of the early morning meal,<br>
 "Break your fast" <b><i>(\arist&#275;sate\)</i></b>. When \ariston\ was applied to<br>
 luncheon, like the Latin _prandium_, \akratisma\ was the term for<br>
 the early breakfast. <B>{My fatlings}</B> <b><i>(\ta sitista\)</i></b>. Verbal from<br>
 \sitiz&#333;\, to feed with wheat or other grain, to fatten. Fed-up or<br>
 fatted animals.<br>
 <br>
 22:5 <B>{Made light of it}</B> <b><i>(\amel&#275;santes\)</i></b>. Literally, neglecting,<br>
 not caring for. They may even have ridiculed the invitation, but<br>
 the verb does not say so. However, to neglect an invitation to a<br>
 wedding feast is a gross discourtesy. <B>{One to his own farm}</B> <b><i>(\hos<br>
 men eis ton idion agron\)</i></b> or field, <B>{another to his merchandise}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hos de epi t&#275;n emporian autou\)</i></b> only example in the N.T., from<br>
 \emporos\, merchant, one who travels for traffic <b><i>(\emporeuomai\)</i></b>,<br>
 a drummer.<br>
 <br>
 22:7 <B>{Armies}</B> <b><i>(\strateumata\)</i></b>. Bands of soldiers, not grand<br>
 armies.<br>
 <br>
 22:9 <B>{The partings of the highways}</B> <b><i>(\tas diexodous t&#333;n hod&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Vulgate, _exitus viarum_. \Diodoi\ are cross-streets, while<br>
 \diexodoi\ <b><i>(double compound)</i></b> seem to be main streets leading out<br>
 of the city where also side-streets may branch off, "by-ways."<br>
 <br>
 22:10 <B>{The wedding}</B> <b><i>(\ho gamos\)</i></b>. But Westcott and Hort rightly<br>
 read here \ho numph&#333;n\, marriage dining hall. The same word in<br>
 <!-#-->9:15 means the bridechamber.<br>
 <br>
 22:12 <B>{Not having a wedding-garment}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; ech&#333;n enduma gamou\)</i></b>.<br>
 \M&#275;\ is in the _Koin&#275;_ the usual negative with participles unless<br>
 special emphasis on the negative is desired as in \ouk<br>
 endedumenon\. There is a subtle distinction between \m&#275;\ and \ou\<br>
 like our subjective and objective notions. Some hold that the<br>
 wedding-garment here is a portion of a lost parable separate from<br>
 that of the Wedding Feast, but there is no evidence for that<br>
 idea. Wunsche does report a parable by a rabbi of a king who set<br>
 no time for his feast and the guests arrived, some properly<br>
 dressed waiting at the door; others in their working clothes did<br>
 not wait, but went off to work and, when the summons suddenly<br>
 came, they had no time to dress properly and were made to stand<br>
 and watch while the others partook of the feast.<br>
 <br>
 22:13 <B>{Was speechless}</B> <b><i>(\epsim&#333;th&#275;\)</i></b>. Was muzzled, dumb from<br>
 confusion and embarrassment. It is used of the ox <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 5:18)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{The outer darkness}</B> <b><i>(\to skotos to ex&#333;teron\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mt 8:12.<br>
 All the blacker from the standpoint of the brilliantly lighted<br>
 banquet hall. <B>{There shall be}</B> <b><i>(\ekei estai\)</i></b>. Out there in the<br>
 outer darkness.<br>
 <br>
 22:14 <B>{For many are called, but few chosen}</B> <b><i>(\polloi gar eisin<br>
 kl&#275;toi oligoi de eklektoi\)</i></b>. This crisp saying of Christ occurs<br>
 in various connections. He evidently repeated many of his sayings<br>
 many times as every teacher does. There is a distinction between<br>
 the called <b><i>(\kl&#275;toi\)</i></b> and the chosen <b><i>(\eklektoi\)</i></b> called out from<br>
 the called.<br>
 <br>
 22:15 <B>{Went}</B> <b><i>(\poreuthentes\)</i></b>. So-called deponent passive and<br>
 redundant use of the verb as in <!-#-->9:13: "Go and learn." <B>{Took<br>
 counsel}</B> <b><i>(\sumboulion elabon\)</i></b>. Like the Latin _consilium capere_<br>
 as in <!-#-->12:14. <B>{Ensnare in his talk}</B> <b><i>(\pagideus&#333;sin en log&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 From \pagis\, a snare or trap. Here only in the N.T. In the LXX<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ki 28:9; Ec 9:12; Test. of Twelve Patriarchs, _Joseph_ 7:1)</i></b>.<br>
 Vivid picture of the effort to trip Jesus in his speech like a<br>
 bird or wild beast.<br>
 <br>
 22:16 <B>{Their disciples}</B> <b><i>(\tous math&#275;tas aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Students,<br>
 pupils, of the Pharisees as in <!-#-->Mr 2:18. There were two<br>
 Pharisaic theological seminaries in Jerusalem <b><i>(Hillel, Shammai)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{The Herodians}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n Her&#333;idian&#333;n\)</i></b>. Not members of Herod's<br>
 family or Herod's soldiers, but partisans or followers of Herod.<br>
 The form in \-ianos\ is a Latin termination like that in<br>
 \Christianos\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:26)</i></b>. Mentioned also in <!-#-->Mr 3:6 combining<br>
 with the Pharisees against Jesus. <B>{The person of men}</B> <b><i>(\pros&#333;pon<br>
 anthr&#333;p&#333;n\)</i></b>. Literally, face of men. Paying regard to appearance<br>
 is the sin of partiality condemned by James <b><i>(<!-#-->Jas 2:1,9)</i></b> when<br>
 \pros&#333;pol&#275;mpsia, pros&#333;pol&#275;mptein\ are used, in imitation of the<br>
 Hebrew idiom. This suave flattery to Jesus implied "that Jesus<br>
 was a reckless simpleton" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:19 <B>{Tribute money}</B> <b><i>(\to nomisma tou k&#275;nsou\)</i></b>. \K&#275;nsos\, Latin<br>
 _census_, was a capitation tax or head-money, _tributum capitis_,<br>
 for which silver denaria were struck, with the figure of Caesar<br>
 and a superscription, e.g. "Tiberiou Kaisaros" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 \Nomisma\ is the Latin _numisma_ and occurs here only in the<br>
 N.T., is common in the old Greek, from \nomiz&#333;\ sanctioned by law<br>
 or custom.<br>
 <br>
 22:20 <B>{This image and superscription}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; eik&#333;n haut&#275; kai h&#275;<br>
 epigraph&#275;\)</i></b>. Probably a Roman coin because of the image <b><i>(picture)</i></b><br>
 on it. The earlier Herods avoided this practice because of Jewish<br>
 prejudice, but the Tetrarch Philip introduced it on Jewish coins<br>
 and he was followed by Herod Agrippa I. This coin was pretty<br>
 certainly stamped in Rome with the image and name of Tiberius<br>
 Caesar on it.<br>
 <br>
 22:21 <B>{Render}</B> <b><i>(\apodote\)</i></b>. "Give back" to Caesar what is already<br>
 Caesar's.<br>
 <br>
 22:24 <B>{Shall marry}</B> <b><i>(\epigambreusei\)</i></b>. The Sadducees were "aiming<br>
 at amusement rather than deadly mischief" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. It was<br>
 probably an old conundrum that they had used to the discomfiture<br>
 of the Pharisees. This passage is quoted from <!-#-->De 25:5,6. The<br>
 word appears here only in the N.T. and elsewhere only in the LXX.<br>
 It is used of any connected by marriage as in <!-#-->Ge 34:9; 1Sa<br>
 18:22. But in <!-#-->Ge 38:8 and <!-#-->De 25:5 it is used specifically of<br>
 one marrying his brother's widow.<br>
 <br>
 22:33 <B>{They were astonished}</B> <b><i>(\exepl&#275;ssonto\)</i></b>. Descriptive<br>
 imperfect passive showing the continued amazement of the crowds.<br>
 They were struck out <b><i>(literally)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:34 <B>{He had put the Sadducees to silence}</B> <b><i>(\ephim&#333;sen tous<br>
 Saddoukaious\)</i></b>. Muzzled the Sadducees. The Pharisees could not<br>
 restrain their glee though they were joining with the Sadducees<br>
 in trying to entrap Jesus. <B>{Gathered themselves together}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sun&#275;chth&#275;san epi to auto\)</i></b>. First aorist passive, were gathered<br>
 together. \Epi to auto\ explains more fully \sun-\. See also <!-#-->Ac<br>
 2:47. "Mustered their forces" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:36 <B>{The great commandment in the law}</B> <b><i>(\entol&#275; megal&#275; en t&#333;i<br>
 nom&#333;i\)</i></b>. The positive adjective is sometimes as high in rank as<br>
 the superlative. See \megas\ in <!-#-->Mt 5:19 in contrast with<br>
 \elachistos\. The superlative \megistos\ occurs in the N.T. only<br>
 in <!-#-->2Pe 1:4. Possibly this scribe wishes to know which<br>
 commandment stood first <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 12:28)</i></b> with Jesus. "The scribes<br>
 declared that there were 248 affirmative precepts, as many as the<br>
 members of the human body; and 365 negative precepts, as many as<br>
 the days in the year, the total being 613, the number of letters<br>
 in the Decalogue" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. But Jesus cuts through such<br>
 pettifogging hair-splitting to the heart of the problem.<br>
 <br>
 22:42 <B>{The Christ}</B> <b><i>(\tou Christou\)</i></b>. The Messiah, of course, not<br>
 Christ as a proper name of Jesus. Jesus here assumes that <!-#-->Ps<br>
 110 refers to the Messiah. By his pungent question about the<br>
 Messiah as David's son and Lord he really touches the problem of<br>
 his Person <b><i>(his Deity and his Humanity)</i></b>. Probably the Pharisees<br>
 had never faced that problem before. They were unable to answer.<br>
