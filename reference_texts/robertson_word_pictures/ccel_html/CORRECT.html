<p>================ Corrections to the printed edition ===================<br>
 Mt 8:7 refers to 'etherapeuonto' in Ac 28:10.  It is actually<br>
    Ac 28:9.  <b><i>(changed)</i></b><br>
 Mt 13:21 appears twice on the printed page.  Removed second<br>
    reference to v.21 and let it fall as a new paragraph under<br>
    the existing v.21.<br>
 Mt 17:2 a reference to 'morphe' in '16:12'.  This reference seems to be<br>
    either 1Co <b><i>(as cited in the sentence)</i></b>, or to the current book <b><i>(Mt)</i></b>.<br>
    It is actually Mr 16:12.  <b><i>(changed)</i></b><br>
 Mt 18:18 a ref to Mt 16:19 mentions 'finding and loosing'. Changed<br>
    to 'binding and loosing'.<br>
 Mt 27:43 a ref to 'Ps 21 <b><i>(22)</i></b>:9'.  I changed this to 'Ps 21; 22:8'<br>
    <b><i>(the vs 9 *must* be a typo, and I am unsure how ch. 21 fits into this)</i></b><br>
 Mr 5:17 ref to "Mt 13:3-4-58", with respect to Jesus be run out.<br>
    Based on parralel ref of Mr 6:1-6, and the same Mt ref given<br>
    at Mr 6:1-6 -- I have determined this ref is a typo and<br>
    should be "Mt 13:54-58".  The ref at Mr 6:1 gives Mt 13:54.<br>
    verses, as printed, 3-4-58 make no sense.  34-58 makes little<br>
    sense.  54-58 matches other parallel references.  <b><i>(changed)</i></b><br>
 Mr 8:17-20 uses 1 note for 4 verses.  I added a one line 'go to' for each<br>
    individual verse -- pointing to v.17 with the note.<br>
 Mr 10:39-45 also uses 1 note for 7 verses.  I added a 'go to' for each<br>
    individual verse -- pointing to v.39 with the note.<br>
 Lu 20:1 compared 19 verses in Lu to "Mr 27-12:12".  This obviously<br>
    was meant to be "Mr 11:27-12:12".<br>
 Lu 20:45 gives comparisons as "Matt. 6:12; Luke 11:12, 15-18".<br>
    These verses do not compare.  The closest thing is Mt 16:12;<br>
    Lu 11:37-54; 12:1. This is a major typo. <b><i>(changed)</i></b>.<br>
 Joh 6:34 refers to Rabbi in "26".  This is actually "25". Changed.<br>
 Joh 8:33 refers to '<b><i>(3:7; Rom. 9:6f.)</i></b>'  unsure if the 3:7 refers to<br>
   the preceeding reference to Matt.  It could also apply to Joh 3:7,<br>
   but 3:6f. would make more sense.  I made it 'Mt 3:7' to apply to<br>
   the previous Matt. reference.<br>
 Joh 8:34 refers to Joh 3:30.  This should be 3:21.  Changed.<br>
 Ac 13:42 gives reference to "Ac 2:11 <b><i>(10)</i></b>" for _proselutoi_.<br>
   this word is in 10, not 11.  unsure what 11 has to do with it,<br>
   and changed the reference to "Ac 2:10".<br>
 Ac 20:30 gives reference for word 'pervert' in 'ac 13:8 10.'  This is<br>
    Ac 13:8,10.  <b><i>(changed)</i></b><br>
 1Co 7:17 Changed the word "believer" to "unbeliver"  Based on the context<br>
     of the note, and the preceeding note -- this must have been a typo.<br>
     We are to remain where we are called, unless the unbeliever wants<br>
     out.<br>
 1Co 7:21 There seems to be a misplaced ')</i></b>'.  I think it should appear<br>
    after 'chresai' to make the question outside the parenthesis. <b><i>(changed)</i></b><br>
 Heb 11:38 has <B>{Wondering}</B>.  This must be a typo.  Changed<br>
   to <B>{Wandering}</B>.<br>
 1Th 1:4 refers to 'Jude 1'.  Usually with one chapter books, verses are<br>
   referred to this way <b><i>(without chapter)</i></b>.  But Jude 1:1 does not<br>
   seem to correlate to this note.  Jude 1:3 does.  Changed.<br>
 Ro 12:4 contains ref to "Tim. 8:13".  regarding word "office", this<br>
   word is in "Ro 8:13".  changed.<br>
 1Ti 1:2 refers to '2Co 8:9; Tit 1:3; 2'.  Something is really wrong here.<br>
   2Co 8:8 is correct, Tit 1:4 is correct, and '2' may refer to this verse.<br>
   Fixed, and removed '2' as being extraneous.  I have never seen this form<br>
   of self-reference, and with the two other errors, it is suspect.<br>
 Col 2:7 refers to 'rooted' in 'Eph 3:17 <b><i>(18)</i></b>'.  Verse 18 has nothing to<br>
   do with it and may be Robertson's own belief in an alternate verse break.<br>
   Removed '<b><i>(18)</i></b>'.<br>
 1Pe 1:22 gives ref to '1:2, 2:14'.  I would expect to see a ';' seperating<br>
   the refs to different chapters.  2:14 does not fit into anything here,<br>
   but 1:14 does, as does 1:2.  I would expect to find a ',' seperating<br>
   refs to different verses.  changed to 1:2,14.<br>
 1:Pe 2:3 gives ref to 'Ps. 33<b><i>(34)</i></b>:9'.  Must be a LXX ref, changed<br>
   to 34:8.<br>
 2Pe 1:13 gives ref to 2Ti 15.  This is 2Ti 1:5.  changed.<br>
 1Jo 1:6 says '... fellowship with God involves walking in the<br>
   light with God *and in the darkness*.'  This must be 'not in the<br>
   darkenss'.  <b><i>(changed)</i></b>.<br>
 3Jo 1:15 This is a note attributed to verse 15.  The KJV verse numbering<br>
 stops at verse 14, and what Robertson shows as 15 is part of 14.<br>
 Removed the verse number and let the note fall under verse 14.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 ====== Unresolved questions of integrity <b><i>(unchanged)</i></b> =============<br>
 <br>
 Joh 10:29 has 'meizon' with no accented 'o', unlike 2 others in the<br>
    same note.<br>
 1Pe 1:1 makes ref to LXX "23:4; 38 or 39 12".  unsure how to handle<br>
    "38 or 39 12".<br>
 1Pe 2:4 gives ref to Isa 28:6 for elect and proved.  This verse does<br>
    not seem to relate. later, 1pe 2:6 gives a correct ref to isa 28:16.<br>
 Re 2:13 refers to <apektanthe> as v. 2:13; 6:11; 5:9, 13; 13:10, 15;<br>
    18, 20; 19:21.  Much of this does not relate to the word.<br>
 <br>
 ====== October 10, 1993<br>
 <br>
 Mt 1:22 has a cxref to Mt 2:15,35, with 35 being invlaid.  It should be<br>
         verse 23.  Changed to Mt 2:15,23.<br>
 Mt 1:22 has a cxref to Joh 28:36.  This should be verses 28 and 36<br>
         for the preceeding cxref to Joh 19:24.  Changed to Joh<br>
         19:24,28,36.<br>
