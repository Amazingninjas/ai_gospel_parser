<p>20:1 <B>{On one of the days}</B> <b><i>(\en mi&#257;i t&#333;n h&#275;mer&#333;n\)</i></b>. Luke's<br>
 favourite way of indicating time. It was the last day of the<br>
 temple teaching <b><i>(Tuesday)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu 20:1-19 is to be compared with<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 11:27-12:12; Mt 21:23-46. <B>{There came upon him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epest&#275;san\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative, ingressive aorist<br>
 of \ephist&#275;mi\, old and common verb, stood up against him, with<br>
 the notion of sudden appearance. These leaders <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->19:47)</i></b> had<br>
 determined to attack Jesus on this morning, both Sadducees <b><i>(chief<br>
 priests)</i></b> and Pharisees <b><i>(scribes)</i></b>, a formal delegation from the<br>
 Sanhedrin.<br>
 <br>
 20:2 <B>{Tell us}</B> <b><i>(\eipon h&#275;min\)</i></b>. Luke adds these words to what<br>
 Mark and Matthew have. Second aorist active imperative for the<br>
 old form \eipe\ and with ending \-on\ of the first aorist active.<br>
 Westcott and Hort punctuate the rest of the sentence as an<br>
 indirect question after \eipon\, but the Revised Version puts a<br>
 semicolon after "us" and retains the direct question. The Greek<br>
 manuscripts have no punctuation.<br>
 <br>
 20:3 <B>{Question}</B> <b><i>(\logon\)</i></b>. Literally, word. So in <!-#-->Mr 11:29; Mt<br>
 21:24.<br>
 <br>
 20:5 <B>{They reasoned with themselves}</B> <b><i>(\sunelogisanto\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist middle of \sullogizomai\, to bring together accounts, an<br>
 old word, only here in the N.T. Mark and Matthew have<br>
 \dielogizonto\ <b><i>(imperfect middle of \dialogizomai\, a kindred<br>
 verb, to reckon between one another, confer)</i></b>. This form<br>
 <b><i>(\dielogizonto\)</i></b> in verse <!-#-->14 below. <B>{If we shall say}</B> <b><i>(\ean<br>
 eip&#333;men\)</i></b>. Third-class condition with second aorist active<br>
 subjunctive. Suppose we say! So in verse <!-#-->6.<br>
 <br>
 20:6 <B>{Will stone us}</B> <b><i>(\katalithasei\)</i></b>. Late verb and here only in<br>
 the N.T. Literally, will throw stones down on us, stone us down,<br>
 overwhelm us with stones. <B>{They be persuaded}</B> <b><i>(\pepeismenos<br>
 estin\)</i></b>. Periphrastic perfect passive indicative of \peith&#333;\, to<br>
 persuade, a settled state of persuasion, "is persuaded" <b><i>(no<br>
 reason for use of "be" here)</i></b>. <B>{That John was a prophet}</B> <b><i>(\I&#333;an&#275;n<br>
 proph&#275;t&#275;n einai\)</i></b>. Accusative and infinitive in indirect<br>
 assertion.<br>
 <br>
 20:7 <B>{That they knew not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; eidenai\)</i></b>. Accusative and<br>
 infinitive in indirect assertion again with the negative \m&#275;\<br>
 rather than \ou\.<br>
 <br>
 20:9 <B>{Vineyard}</B> <b><i>(\ampel&#333;na\)</i></b>. Late word from \ampelos\ <b><i>(vine)</i></b>,<br>
 place of vines. So in <!-#-->Mr 12:1; Mt 21:33. <B>{Let it out}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\exedeto\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle of \ekdid&#333;mi\, but with<br>
 variable vowel \e\ in place of \o\ of the stem \do\ <b><i>(\exedoto\)</i></b>.<br>
 Same form in Mark and Matthew. <B>{For a long time}</B> <b><i>(\chronous<br>
 hikanous\)</i></b>. Accusative of extent of time, considerable times or<br>
 periods of time. Not in Mark and Matthew, though all three have<br>
 \aped&#275;m&#275;sen\ <b><i>(went off from home)</i></b>. See on &#175;Lu 7:6 for \hikanos\.<br>
 <br>
 20:10 <B>{At the season}</B> <b><i>(\kair&#333;i\)</i></b>. The definite season for the<br>
 fruit like \ho kairos t&#333;n karp&#333;n\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 21:34)</i></b>. That they should<br>
 give <b><i>(\hina d&#333;sousin\)</i></b>. Future indicative with \hina\ for purpose<br>
 like the aorist subjunctive, though not so frequent.<br>
 <br>
 20:11 <B>{He sent yet another}</B> <b><i>(\prosetheto heteron pempsai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, <B>{he added to send another}</B>. A clear Hebraism repeated<br>
 in verse <!-#-->12 and also in <!-#-->19:11.<br>
 <br>
 20:12 <B>{They wounded}</B> <b><i>(\traumatisantes\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 participle of \traumatiz&#333;\. An old verb, from \trauma\, a wound,<br>
 but in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ac 19:16.<br>
 <br>
 20:13 <B>{What shall I do?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti poi&#275;s&#333;;\)</i></b>. Deliberative future<br>
 indicative or aorist subjunctive <b><i>(same form)</i></b>. This detail only in<br>
 Luke. Note the variations in all three Gospels. All three have<br>
 "will reverence" <b><i>(\entrap&#275;sontai\)</i></b> for which see Matthew and<br>
 Mark. <B>{It may be}</B> <b><i>(\is&#333;s\)</i></b>. Perhaps, from \isos\, equal. Old<br>
 adverb, but only here in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 20:14 <B>{That the inheritance may be ours}</B> <b><i>(\hina h&#275;m&#333;n gen&#275;tai h&#275;<br>
 kl&#275;ronomia\)</i></b>. That the inheritance may become <b><i>(\gen&#275;tai\, second<br>
 aorist middle subjunctive of \ginomai\)</i></b>. Here <!-#-->Mt 21:39 has<br>
 \sch&#333;men\ "let us get, ingressive aorist active subjunctive." Cf.<br>
 \ech&#333;men\, present subjunctive of the same verb \ech&#333;\ in <!-#-->Ro<br>
 5:1; Mr 12:7 has "and it will be ours" <b><i>(\estai\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 20:16 <B>{God forbid}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; genoito\)</i></b>. Optative of wish about the<br>
 future with \m&#275;\. Literally, <B>{may it not happen}</B>. No word "God"<br>
 in the Greek. This was the pious protest of the defeated members<br>
 of the Sanhedrin who began to see the turn of the parable against<br>
 themselves.<br>
 <br>
 20:17 <B>{He looked upon them}</B> <b><i>(\emblepsas autois\)</i></b>. Not in Mark and<br>
 Matthew. First aorist active participle of \emblep&#333;\, to look on.<br>
 It was a piercing glance. The scripture quoted is from <!-#-->Ps<br>
 118:22 and is in <!-#-->Mr 11:10; Mt 21:42, which see for the<br>
 inverted attraction of the case \lithon\ <b><i>(stone)</i></b> to that of the<br>
 relative \hon\ <b><i>(which)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 20:18 <B>{Shall be broken to pieces}</B> <b><i>(\sunthlasth&#275;setai\)</i></b>. Future<br>
 passive indicative of \sunthla&#333;\, a rather late compound, only<br>
 here in the N.T. unless <!-#-->Mt 21:44 is genuine. It means to<br>
 shatter. <B>{Will scatter him as dust}</B> <b><i>(\likm&#275;sei\)</i></b>. From \likma&#333;\,<br>
 an old verb to winnow and then to grind to powder. Only here in<br>
 the N.T. unless in <!-#-->Mt 21:44 is genuine, which see.<br>
 <br>
 20:19 <B>{To lay hands on him}</B> <b><i>(\epibalein ep' auton tas cheiras\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist active infinitive of \epiball&#333;\, an old verb and<br>
 either transitively as here or intransitively as in <!-#-->Mr 4:37.<br>
 Vivid picture here where <!-#-->Mr 12:12; Mt 21:46 has "to seize"<br>
 <b><i>(\krat&#275;sai\)</i></b>. <B>{In that very hour}</B> <b><i>(\en aut&#275;i t&#275;i h&#333;r&#257;i\)</i></b>. Luke's<br>
 favourite idiom, in the hour itself. Not in Mark or Matthew and<br>
 shows that the Sanhedrin were angry enough to force the climax<br>
 then. <B>{And they feared}</B> <b><i>(\kai ephob&#275;th&#275;san\)</i></b>. Adversative use of<br>
 \kai\ = but they feared. Hence they refrained. <B>{For they<br>
 perceived}</B> <b><i>(\egn&#333;san gar\)</i></b>. The reason for their rage. Second<br>
 aorist active indicative of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\. <B>{Against them}</B> <b><i>(\pros<br>
 autous\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->Mr 12:12. The cap fitted them and they saw it.<br>
 <br>
 20:20 <B>{They watched him}</B> <b><i>(\parat&#275;r&#275;santes\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 participle of \parat&#275;re&#333;\, a common Greek verb to watch on the<br>
 side or insidiously or with evil intent as in <!-#-->Lu 6:7<br>
 <b><i>(\paret&#275;rounto\)</i></b> of the scribes and Pharisees. See on &#175;Mr 3:2.<br>
 There is no "him" in the Greek. They were watching their chance.<br>
 <B>{Spies}</B> <b><i>(\enkathetous\)</i></b>. An old verbal adjective from<br>
 \enkathi&#275;mi\, to send down in or secretly. It means liers in wait<br>
 who are suborned to spy out, one who is hired to trap one by<br>
 crafty words. Only here in the N.T. <B>{Feigned themselves}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hupokrinomenous heautous\)</i></b>. Hypocritically professing to be<br>
 "righteous" <b><i>(\dikaious\)</i></b>. "They posed as scrupulous persons with<br>
 a difficulty of conscience" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{That they might take hold<br>
 of his speech}</B> <b><i>(\hina epilab&#333;ntai autou logou\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 middle of \epilamban&#333;\, an old verb for seizing hold with the<br>
 hands and uses as here the genitive case. These spies are for the<br>
 purpose of <b><i>(\hina\)</i></b> catching hold of the talk of Jesus if they<br>
 can get a grip anywhere. This is their direct purpose and the<br>
 ultimate purpose or result is also stated, "so as to deliver him<br>
 up" <b><i>(\h&#333;ste paradounai auton\)</i></b>. Second aorist active infinitive<br>
 of \paradid&#333;mi\, to hand over, to give from one's side to<br>
 another. The trap is all set now and ready to be sprung by these<br>
 "spies." <B>{Of the governor}</B> <b><i>(\tou h&#275;gemonos\)</i></b>. The Sanhedrin knew<br>
 that Pilate would have to condemn Jesus if he were put to death.<br>
 So then all their plans focus on this point as the goal. Luke<br>
 alone mentions this item here.<br>
 <br>
 20:21 <B>{Rightly}</B> <b><i>(\orth&#333;s\)</i></b>. Matthew <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 22:16)</i></b> notes that these<br>
 "spies" were "disciples" <b><i>(students)</i></b> of the Pharisees and Mark<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 12:13)</i></b> adds that the Herodians are also involved in the<br>
 plot. These bright theologues are full of palaver and flattery<br>
 and openly endorse the teaching of Jesus as part of their scheme.<br>
 <B>{Acceptest not the person of any}</B> <b><i>(\ou lambaneis pros&#333;pon\)</i></b>. Dost<br>
 not take the face <b><i>(or personal appearance)</i></b> as the test. It is a<br>
 Hebraism from which the word \pros&#333;polempsia\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Jas 2:1)</i></b> comes.<br>
 Originally it meant to lift the face, to lift the countenance, to<br>
 regard the face, to accept the face value. See <!-#-->Mr 12:13-17; Mt<br>
 22:15-22 for discussion of details here. They both have<br>
 \blepeis\ here.<br>
 <br>
 20:22 <B>{Tribute}</B> <b><i>(\phoron\)</i></b>. Old word for the annual tax on land,<br>
 houses, etc. Mark and Matthew have \k&#275;nson\, which see for this<br>
 Latin word in Greek letters. The picture on the coin may have<br>
 been that of Tiberius.<br>
 <br>
 20:23 <B>{Perceived}</B> <b><i>(\katano&#275;sas\)</i></b>. From \katanoe&#333;\, to put the<br>
 mind down on. Mark has \eid&#333;s\, "knowing," and Matthew \gnous\,<br>
 coming to know or grasping <b><i>(second aorist active participle of<br>
 \gin&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b>. <B>{Craftiness}</B> <b><i>(\panourgian\)</i></b>. Old word for doing any<br>
 deed. Matthew has "wickedness" <b><i>(\pon&#275;rian\)</i></b> and Mark "hypocrisy"<br>
 <b><i>(\hupokrisin\)</i></b>. Unscrupulous they certainly were. They would<br>
 stoop to any trick and go the limit.<br>
 <br>
 20:26 <B>{They were not able}</B> <b><i>(\ouk ischusan\)</i></b>. They did not have<br>
 strength. An old verb \ischu&#333;\ from \ischus\ <b><i>(strength)</i></b>. They<br>
 failed "to take hold <b><i>(cf. verse <!-#-->20)</i></b> of the saying before the<br>
 people." These "crack" students had made an ignominious failure<br>
 and were not able to make a case for the surrender of Jesus to<br>
 Pilate. He had slipped through their net with the utmost ease.<br>
 <B>{Held their peace}</B> <b><i>(\esig&#275;san\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist active of<br>
 \siga&#333;\. They became silent as they went back with the "dry<br>
 grins."<br>
 <br>
 20:27 <B>{There is no resurrection}</B> <b><i>(\anastasin m&#275; einai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Accusative and infinitive with negative \m&#275;\ in indirect<br>
 assertion. The Sadducees rally after the complete discomfiture of<br>
 the Pharisees and Herodians. They had a stock conundrum with<br>
 which they had often gotten a laugh on the Pharisees. So they<br>
 volunteer to try it on Jesus. For discussion of details here see<br>
 on &#175;Mt 22:23-33; Mr 12:18-27. Only a few striking items remain<br>
 for Luke.<br>
 <br>
 20:33 <B>{Had her}</B> <b><i>(\eschon\)</i></b>. Constative second aorist indicative<br>
 of \ech&#333;\ including all seven seriatim. So <!-#-->Mt 22:28; Mr 12:33<br>
 <B>{To wife}</B> <b><i>(\gunaika\)</i></b>. As wife, accusative in apposition with<br>
 "her."<br>
 <br>
 20:36 <B>{Equal unto the angels}</B> <b><i>(\isaggeloi\)</i></b>. A rare and late word<br>
 from \isos\, equal, and \aggelos\. Only here in the N.T. Mark and<br>
 Matthew have "as angels" <b><i>(\h&#333;s aggeloi\)</i></b>. Angels do not marry,<br>
 there is no marriage in heaven. <B>{Sons of God, being sons of the<br>
 resurrection}</B> <b><i>(\huioi theou t&#275;s anastase&#333;s huioi ontes\)</i></b>. This<br>
 Hebraistic phrase, "sons of the resurrection" defines "sons of<br>
 God" and is a direct answer to the Sadducees.<br>
 <br>
 20:37 <B>{Even Moses}</B> <b><i>(\kai M&#333;us&#275;s\)</i></b>. Moses was used by the<br>
 Sadducees to support their denial of the resurrection. This<br>
 passage <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 3:6)</i></b> Jesus skilfully uses as a proof of the<br>
 resurrection. See discussion on &#175;Mt 22:32; Mr 12:26f.<br>
 <br>
 20:39 <B>{Certain of the scribes}</B> <b><i>(\tines t&#333;n grammate&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Pharisees who greatly enjoyed this use by Jesus of a portion of<br>
 the Pentateuch against the position of the Sadducees. So they<br>
 praise the reply of Jesus, hostile though they are to him.<br>
 <br>
 20:40 <B>{They durst not any more}</B> <b><i>(\ouketi etolm&#333;n ouden\)</i></b>. Double<br>
 negative and imperfect active of \tolma&#333;\. The courage of<br>
 Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians vanished.<br>
 <br>
 20:41 <B>{How say they?}</B> <b><i>(\P&#333;s legousin;\)</i></b>. The Pharisees had<br>
 rallied in glee and one of their number, a lawyer, had made a<br>
 feeble contribution to the controversy which resulted in his<br>
 agreement with Jesus and in praise from Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 12:28-34; Mt<br>
 27:34-40)</i></b>. Luke does not give this incident which makes it plain<br>
 that by "they say" <b><i>(\legousin\)</i></b> Jesus refers to the Pharisees<br>
 <b><i>(rabbis, lawyers)</i></b>, carrying on the discussion and turning the<br>
 tables on them while the Pharisees are still gathered together<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 22:41)</i></b>. The construction with \legousin\ is the usual<br>
 infinitive and the accusative in indirect discourse. By "the<br>
 Christ" <b><i>(\ton Christon\)</i></b> "the Messiah" is meant.<br>
 <br>
 20:42 <B>{For David himself}</B> <b><i>(\autos gar Daueid\)</i></b>. This language of<br>
 Jesus clearly means that he treats David as the author of <!-#-->Ps<br>
 110. The inspiration of this Psalm is expressly stated in <!-#-->Mr<br>
 12:36; Mt 22:43 <b><i>(which see)</i></b> and the Messianic character of the<br>
 Psalm in all three Synoptics who all quote the LXX practically<br>
 alike. Modern criticism that denies the Davidic authorship of<br>
 this Psalm has to say either that Jesus was ignorant of the fact<br>
 about it or that he declined to disturb the current acceptation<br>
 of the Davidic authorship. Certainly modern scholars are not<br>
 agreed on the authorship of <!-#-->Ps 110. Meanwhile one can certainly<br>
 be excused for accepting the natural implication of the words of<br>
 Jesus here, "David himself." <B>{In the book of the Psalms}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 bibl&#333;i Psalm&#333;n\)</i></b>. Compare <!-#-->3:4 "in the book of the words of<br>
 Isaiah the prophet."<br>
 <br>
 20:44 <B>{David therefore}</B> <b><i>(\Daueid oun\)</i></b>. Without \ei\ as in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 22:45. On the basis of this definite piece of exegesis <b><i>(\oun\,<br>
 therefore)</i></b> Jesus presses the problem <b><i>(\p&#333;s\, how)</i></b> for an<br>
 explanation. The deity and the humanity of the Messiah in <!-#-->Ps<br>
 110 are thus set forth, the very problems that disturbed the<br>
 rabbis then and that upset many critics today.<br>
 <br>
 20:45 <B>{In the hearing of all the people}</B> <b><i>(\akouontos pantos tou<br>
 laou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute, "while all the people were listening"<br>
 <b><i>(present active participle)</i></b>. That is the time to speak. The<br>
 details in this verse and verse <!-#-->47 are precisely those given in<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 12:38f., which see for discussion of details. <!-#-->Mt 23:1-39<br>
 has a very full and rich description of this last phase of the<br>
 debate in the temple where Jesus drew a full-length portrait of<br>
 the hypocrisy of the Pharisees and scribes in their presence. It<br>
 was a solemn climax to this last public appearance of Christ in<br>
 the temple when Jesus poured out the vials of his indignation as<br>
 he had done before <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 16:2; Lu 11:37-54; 12-1)</i></b>.<br>
