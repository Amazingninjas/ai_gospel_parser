<p>9:1 <B>{His own city}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n idian polin\)</i></b>. Capernaum <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 2:1; Mt<br>
 4:13)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:2 <B>{They brought}</B> <b><i>(\prosepheron\)</i></b>. Imperfect, "were bringing,"<br>
 graphic picture made very vivid by the details in <!-#-->Mr 2:1-4 and<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 5:17. "<B>{Lying on a bed}</B>" <b><i>(stretched on a couch)</i></b>, perfect<br>
 passive participle, a little bed or couch <b><i>(\klinidion\)</i></b> in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 5:19, "a pallet" <b><i>(\krabatos\)</i></b> in <!-#-->Mr 2:4,9,11. <B>{Thy sins are<br>
 forgiven}</B> <b><i>(\aphientai\)</i></b>. Present passive indicative <b><i>(aoristic<br>
 present)</i></b>. Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 5:21)</i></b> has \aphe&#333;ntai\, Doric and Ionic<br>
 perfect passive indicative for the Attic \apheintai\, one of the<br>
 dialectical forms appearing in the _Koin&#275;_.<br>
 <br>
 9:3 <B>{This man blasphemeth}</B> <b><i>(\houtos blasph&#275;mei\)</i></b>. See the sneer<br>
 in "this fellow." "The prophet always is a scandalous, irreverent<br>
 blasphemer from the conventional point of view" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:6 <B>{That ye may know}</B> <b><i>(\hina eid&#275;te\)</i></b>. Jesus accepts the<br>
 challenge in the thoughts of the scribes and performs the miracle<br>
 of healing the paralytic, who so far only had his sins forgiven,<br>
 to prove his Messianic power on earth to forgive sins even as God<br>
 does. The word \exousia\ may mean either power or authority. He<br>
 had both as a matter of fact. Note same word in <!-#-->9:8. <B>{Then<br>
 saith he to the sick of the palsy}</B> <b><i>(\tote legei t&#333;i<br>
 paralutik&#333;i\)</i></b>. These words of course, were not spoken by Jesus.<br>
 Curiously enough Matthew interjects them right in the midst of<br>
 the sayings of Jesus in reply to the scorn of the scribes. Still<br>
 more remarkable is the fact that Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 2:10)</i></b> has precisely<br>
 the same words in the same place save that Matthew has added<br>
 \tote\, of which he is fond, to what Mark already had. Mark, as<br>
 we know, largely reports Peter's words and sees with Peter's<br>
 eyes. Luke has the same idea in the same place without the vivid<br>
 historical present \legei <b><i>(eipen t&#333;i paralelumen&#333;i)</i></b>\ with the<br>
 participle in place of the adjective. This is one of the many<br>
 proofs that both Matthew and Luke made use of Mark's Gospel each<br>
 in his own way. <B>{Take up thy bed}</B> <b><i>(\&#257;ron sou t&#275;n klin&#275;n\)</i></b>. Pack<br>
 up at once <b><i>(aorist active imperative)</i></b> the rolled-up pallet.<br>
 <br>
 9:9 <B>{At the place of toll}</B> <b><i>(\epi to tel&#333;nion\)</i></b>. The tax-office or<br>
 custom-house of Capernaum placed here to collect taxes from the<br>
 boats going across the lake outside of Herod's territory or from<br>
 people going from Damascus to the coast, a regular caravan route.<br>
 "<B>{Called Matthew}</B>" <b><i>(\Maththaion legomenon\)</i></b> and in <!-#-->10:3 Matthew<br>
 the publican is named as one of the Twelve Apostles. Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 2:14)</i></b> and Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 5:27)</i></b> call this man Levi. He had two names<br>
 as was common, Matthew Levi. The publicans <b><i>(\tel&#333;nai\)</i></b> get their<br>
 name in English from the Latin _publicanus_ <b><i>(a man who did public<br>
 duty)</i></b>, not a very accurate designation. They were detested<br>
 because they practised graft. Even Gabinius the proconsul of<br>
 Syria was accused by Cicero of relieving Syrians and Jews of<br>
 legitimate taxes for graft. He ordered some of the tax-officers<br>
 removed. Already Jesus had spoken of the publican <b><i>(<!-#-->5:46)</i></b> in a<br>
 way that shows the public disfavour in which they were held.<br>
 <br>
 9:10 <B>{Publicans and sinners}</B> <b><i>(\tel&#333;nai kai hamart&#333;loi\)</i></b>. Often<br>
 coupled together in common scorn and in contrast with the<br>
 righteous <b><i>(\dikaioi\ in <!-#-->9:13)</i></b>. It was a strange medley at<br>
 Levi's feast <b><i>(Jesus and the four fisher disciples, Nathanael and<br>
 Philip; Matthew Levi and his former companions, publicans and<br>
 sinners; Pharisees with their scribes or students as on-lookers;<br>
 disciples of John the Baptist who were fasting at the very time<br>
 that Jesus was feasting and with such a group)</i></b>. The Pharisees<br>
 criticize sharply "your teacher" for such a social breach of<br>
 "reclining" together with publicans at Levi's feast.<br>
 <br>
 9:12 <B>{But they that are sick}</B> <b><i>(\alla hoi kak&#333;s echontes\)</i></b>.<br>
 Probably a current proverb about the physician. As a physician of<br>
 body and soul Jesus was bound to come in close touch with the<br>
 social outcasts.<br>
 <br>
 9:13 <B>{But go ye and learn}</B> <b><i>(\poreuthentes de mathete\)</i></b>. With<br>
 biting sarcasm Jesus bids these preachers to learn the meaning of<br>
 <!-#-->Ho 6:6. It is repeated in <!-#-->Mt 12:7. Ingressive aorist<br>
 imperative <b><i>(\mathete\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:14 <B>{The disciples of John}</B> <b><i>(\hoi math&#275;tai I&#333;anou\)</i></b>. One is<br>
 surprised to find disciples of the Baptist in the role of critics<br>
 of Christ along with the Pharisees. But John was languishing in<br>
 prison and they perhaps were blaming Jesus for doing nothing<br>
 about it. At any rate John would not have gone to Levi's feast on<br>
 one of the Jewish fast-days. "The strict asceticism of the<br>
 Baptist <b><i>(<!-#-->11:18)</i></b> and of the Pharisaic rabbis <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 18:12)</i></b> was<br>
 imitated by their disciples" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:15 <B>{The sons of the bride-chamber}</B> <b><i>(\hoi huioi tou numph&#333;nos\)</i></b>.<br>
 It is a late Hebrew idiom for the wedding guests, "the friends of<br>
 the bridegroom and all the sons of the bride-chamber" <b><i>(_Tos.<br>
 Berak._ ii. 10)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Joh 2:29.<br>
 <br>
 9:16 <B>{Undressed cloth}</B> <b><i>(\rhakous agnaphou\)</i></b>. An unfulled, raw<br>
 piece of woollen cloth that will shrink when wet and tear a<br>
 bigger hole than ever. <B>{A worse rent}</B> <b><i>(\cheiron schisma\)</i></b>. Our<br>
 word "schism." The "<B>{patch}</B>" <b><i>(\pl&#275;r&#333;ma\, filling up)</i></b> thus does<br>
 more harm than good.<br>
 <br>
 9:17 <B>{Old wineskins}</B> <b><i>(\askous palaious\)</i></b>. Not glass "<B>{bottles}</B>"<br>
 but wineskins used as bottles as is true in Palestine yet,<br>
 goatskins with the rough part inside. "Our word _bottle_<br>
 originally carried the true meaning, being a bottle of leather.<br>
 In Spanish _bota_ means a _leather bottle_, a _boot_, and a<br>
 _butt_. In Spain wine is still brought to market in pig-skins "<br>
 <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. The new wine will ferment and crack the dried-up old<br>
 skins. <B>{The wine is spilled}</B> <b><i>(\ekcheitai\)</i></b>, poured out.<br>
 <br>
 9:18 <B>{Is even now dead}</B> <b><i>(\arti eteleut&#275;sen\)</i></b>. Aorist tense with<br>
 \arti\ and so better, "just now died," "just dead" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>.<br>
 Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 5:23)</i></b> has it "at the point of death," Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:42)</i></b><br>
 "lay a dying." It is not always easy even for physicians to tell<br>
 when actual death has come. Jesus in <!-#-->9:24 pointedly said, "The<br>
 damsel is not dead, but sleepeth," meaning that she did not die<br>
 to stay dead.<br>
 <br>
 9:20 <B>{The border of his garment}</B> <b><i>(\tou kraspedou tou himatiou\)</i></b>.<br>
 The hem or fringe of a garment, a tassel or tuft hanging from the<br>
 edge of the outer garment according to <!-#-->Nu 15:38. It was made of<br>
 twisted wool. Jesus wore the dress of other people with these<br>
 fringes at the four corners of the outer garment. The Jews<br>
 actually counted the words _Jehovah One_ from the numbers of the<br>
 twisted white threads, a refinement that Jesus had no concern<br>
 for. This poor woman had an element of superstition in her faith<br>
 as many people have, but Jesus honours her faith and cures her.<br>
 <br>
 9:23 <B>{The flute-players}</B> <b><i>(\tous aul&#275;tas\)</i></b>. The girl was just<br>
 dead, but already a crowd "making a tumult" <b><i>(\thoruboumenon\)</i></b><br>
 with wild wailing and screaming had gathered in the outer court,<br>
 "brought together by various motives, sympathy, money, desire to<br>
 share in the meat and drink going at such a time" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 Besides the several flute-players <b><i>(voluntary or hired)</i></b> there were<br>
 probably "some hired mourning women <b><i>(<!-#-->Jer 9:17)</i></b> _praeficae_,<br>
 whose duty it was to sing _naenia_ in praise of the dead"<br>
 <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. These when put out by Jesus, "laughed him to scorn"<br>
 <b><i>(\kategel&#333;n\)</i></b>, in a sort of loud and repeated <b><i>(imperfect)</i></b> guffaw<br>
 of scorn. Jesus overcame all this repellent environment.<br>
 <br>
 9:27 <B>{As Jesus passed by}</B> <b><i>(\paragonti I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. Associative<br>
 instrumental case with \&#275;kolouth&#275;san\. It was the supreme<br>
 opportunity of these two blind men. Note two demoniacs in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 8:28 and two blind men in <!-#-->Mt 20:30. See the same word<br>
 \parag&#333;n\ used of Jesus in <!-#-->9:9.<br>
 <br>
 9:29 <B>{Touched their eyes}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;psato t&#333;n ophthalm&#333;n\)</i></b>. The men had<br>
 faith <b><i>(<!-#-->9:28)</i></b> and Jesus rewards their faith and yet he touched<br>
 their eyes as he sometimes did with kindly sympathy.<br>
 <br>
 9:30 <B>{Were opened}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;ne&#333;ichth&#275;san\)</i></b>. Triple augment <b><i>(on \oi=&#333;i,<br>
 e\ and then on preposition \an = &#275;n\)</i></b>. <B>{Strictly charged them}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\enebrim&#275;th&#275; autois\)</i></b>. A difficult word, compound of \en\ and<br>
 \brimaomai\ <b><i>(to be moved with anger)</i></b>. It is used of horses<br>
 snorting <b><i>(Aeschylus, _Theb_. 461)</i></b>, of men fretting or being angry<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Da 11:30)</i></b>. Allen notes that it occurs twice in Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:43;<br>
 14:5)</i></b> when Matthew omits it. It is found only here in Matthew.<br>
 John has it twice in a different sense <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 11:33 with \en<br>
 heaut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Here and in <!-#-->Mr 1:32 it has the notion of commanding<br>
 sternly, a sense unknown to ancient writers. Most manuscripts<br>
 have the middle \enebrim&#275;sato\, but Aleph and B have the passive<br>
 \enebrim&#275;th&#275;\ which Westcott and Hort accept, but without the<br>
 passive sense <b><i>(cf. \apekrith&#275;\)</i></b>. "The word describes rather a<br>
 rush of deep feeling which in the synoptic passages showed itself<br>
 in a vehement injunctive and in <!-#-->Joh 11:33 in look and manner"<br>
 <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. Bruce translates Euthymius Zigabenus on <!-#-->Mr 1:32:<br>
 "Looked severely, contracting His eyebrows, and shaking His head<br>
 at them as they are wont to do who wish to make sure that secrets<br>
 will be kept." "See to it, let no one know it" <b><i>(\horate, m&#275;deis<br>
 gin&#333;sket&#333;\)</i></b>. Note elliptical change of persons and number in the<br>
 two imperatives.<br>
 <br>
 9:32 <B>{A dumb man}</B> <b><i>(\k&#333;phon\)</i></b>. Literally blunted in tongue as here<br>
 and so dumb, in ear as in <!-#-->Mt 11:5 and so deaf. Homer used it of<br>
 a blunted dart <b><i>(_Iliad_ xi. 390)</i></b>. Others applied it to mental<br>
 dulness.<br>
 <br>
 9:34 <B>{By the prince of the devils}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i archonti t&#333;n<br>
 daimoni&#333;n\)</i></b>. Demons, not devils. The codex Bezae omits this<br>
 verse, but it is probably genuine. The Pharisees are becoming<br>
 desperate and, unable to deny the reality of the miracles, they<br>
 seek to discredit them by trying to connect Jesus with the devil<br>
 himself, the prince of the demons. They will renew this charge<br>
 later <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 12:24)</i></b> when Jesus will refute it with biting sarcasm.<br>
 <br>
 9:35 <B>{And Jesus went about}</B> <b><i>(\kai peri&#275;gen ho I&#275;sous\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 tense descriptive of this third tour of all Galilee.<br>
 <br>
 9:36 <B>{Were distressed and scattered}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san eskulmenoi kai<br>
 erimmenoi\)</i></b>. Periphrastic past perfect indicative passive. A sad<br>
 and pitiful state the crowds were in. Rent or mangled as if by<br>
 wild beasts. \Skull&#333;\ occurs in the papyri in sense of plunder,<br>
 concern, vexation. "Used here of the common people, it describes<br>
 their religious condition. They were harassed, importuned,<br>
 bewildered by those who should have taught them; hindered from<br>
 entering into the kingdom of heaven <b><i>(<!-#-->23:13)</i></b>, laden with the<br>
 burdens which the Pharisees laid upon them <b><i>(<!-#-->23:3)</i></b>. \Erimmenoi\<br>
 denotes men cast down and prostrate on the ground, whether from<br>
 drunkenness, Polyb. v. 48.2, or from mortal wounds" <b><i>(Allen)</i></b>: This<br>
 perfect passive participle from \rhipt&#333;\, to throw down. The<br>
 masses were in a state of mental dejection. No wonder that Jesus<br>
 was moved with compassion <b><i>(\esplagchnisth&#275;\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:38 <B>{That he send forth labourers}</B> <b><i>(\hop&#333;s ekbal&#275;i ergatas\)</i></b>.<br>
 Jesus turns from the figure of the shepherdless sheep to the<br>
 harvest field ripe and ready for the reapers. The verb \ekball&#333;\<br>
 really means to drive out, to push out, to draw out with violence<br>
 or without. Prayer is the remedy offered by Jesus in this crisis<br>
 for a larger ministerial supply. How seldom do we hear prayers<br>
 for more preachers. Sometimes God literally has to push or force<br>
 a man into the ministry who resists his known duty.<br>
