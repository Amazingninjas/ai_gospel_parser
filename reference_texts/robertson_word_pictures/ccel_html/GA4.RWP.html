 <HR>
<p>4:1 <B>{So long as}</B> <b><i>(\eph' hoson chronon\)</i></b>. "For how long a time,"<br>
 incorporation of the antecedent <b><i>(\chronon\)</i></b> into the relative<br>
 clause. <B>{The heir}</B> <b><i>(\ho kl&#275;ronomos\)</i></b>. Old word <b><i>(\kl&#275;ros\, lot,<br>
 \nemomai\, to possess)</i></b>. Illustration from the law of inheritance<br>
 carrying on the last thought in <!-#-->3:29. <B>{A child}</B> <b><i>(\n&#275;pios\)</i></b>. One<br>
 that does not talk <b><i>(\n&#275;, epos\, word)</i></b>. That is a minor, an<br>
 infant, immature intellectually and morally in contrast with<br>
 \teleioi\, full grown <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 3:1; 14:20; Php 3:15; Eph 4:13)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{From a bondservant}</B> <b><i>(\doulou\)</i></b>. Slave. Ablative case of<br>
 comparison after \diapherei\ for which verb see on &#175;Mt 6:26.<br>
 <B>{Though he is lord of all}</B> <b><i>(\Kurios pant&#333;n &#333;n\)</i></b>. Concessive<br>
 participle \&#333;n\, "being legally owner of all" <b><i>(one who has the<br>
 power, \ho ech&#333;n kuros\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:2 <B>{Under guardians}</B> <b><i>(\hupo epitropous\)</i></b>. Old word from<br>
 \epitrep&#333;\, to commit, to intrust. So either an overseer <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 20:8)</i></b> or one in charge of children as here. It is common as the<br>
 guardian of an orphan minor. Frequent in the papyri as guardian<br>
 of minors. <B>{Stewards}</B> <b><i>(\oikonomous\)</i></b>. Old word for manager of a<br>
 household whether freeborn or slave. See <!-#-->Lu 12:42; 1Co 4:2.<br>
 Papyri show it as manager of an estate and also as treasurer like<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 16:23. No example is known where this word is used of one in<br>
 charge of a minor and no other where both occur together. <B>{Until<br>
 the time appointed of the father}</B> <b><i>(\achri t&#275;s prothesmias tou<br>
 patros\)</i></b>. Supply \h&#275;meras\ <b><i>(day)</i></b>, for \prothesmios\ is an old<br>
 adjective "appointed beforehand" <b><i>(\pro, thesmos\, from<br>
 \tith&#275;mi\)</i></b>. Under Roman law the _tutor_ had charge of the child<br>
 till he was fourteen when the curator took charge of him till he<br>
 was twenty-five. Ramsay notes that in Graeco-Phrygia cities the<br>
 same law existed except that the father in Syria appointed both<br>
 tutor and curator whereas the Roman father appointed only the<br>
 tutor. Burton argues plausibly that no such legal distinction is<br>
 meant by Paul, but that the terms here designate two functions of<br>
 one person. The point does not disturb Paul's illustration at<br>
 all.<br>
 <br>
 4:3 <B>{When we were children}</B> <b><i>(\hote &#275;men n&#275;pioi\)</i></b>. Before the<br>
 epoch of faith came and we <b><i>(Jews and Gentiles)</i></b> were under the law<br>
 as paedagogue, guardian, steward, to use all of Paul's metaphors.<br>
 <B>{We were held in bondage}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meis &#275;metha dedoul&#333;menoi\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic past perfect of \doulo&#333;\, to enslave, in a permanent<br>
 state of bondage. <B>{Under the rudiments of the world}</B> <b><i>(\hupo ta<br>
 stoicheia tou kosmou\)</i></b>. \Stoichos\ is row or rank, a series. So<br>
 \stoicheion\ is any first thing in a \stoichos\ like the letters<br>
 of the alphabet, the material elements in the universe <b><i>(<!-#-->2Pe<br>
 3:10)</i></b>, the heavenly bodies <b><i>(some argue for that here)</i></b>, the<br>
 rudiments of any act <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 5:12; Ac 15:10; Ga 5:1; 4:3,9; Col<br>
 2:8,20)</i></b>. The papyri illustrate all the varieties in meaning of<br>
 this word. Burton has a valuable excursus on the word in his<br>
 commentary. Probably here <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b> Paul has in mind the<br>
 rudimentary character of the law as it applies to both Jews and<br>
 Gentiles, to all the knowledge of the world <b><i>(\kosmos\ as the<br>
 orderly material universe as in <!-#-->Col 2:8,20)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 13:38;<br>
 Ac 17:24; 1Co 3:22. All were in the elementary stage before<br>
 Christ came.<br>
 <br>
 4:4 <B>{The fulness of the time}</B> <b><i>(\to pl&#275;r&#333;ma tou chronou\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 word from \pl&#275;ro&#333;\, to fill. Here the complement of the preceding<br>
 time as in <!-#-->Eph 1:10. Some examples in the papyri in the sense<br>
 of complement, to accompany. God sent forth his preexisting Son<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 2:6)</i></b> when the time for his purpose had come like the<br>
 \prothesmia\ of verse <!-#-->2. <B>{Born of a woman}</B> <b><i>(\genomenon ek<br>
 gunaikos\)</i></b>. As all men are and so true humanity, "coming from a<br>
 woman." There is, of course, no direct reference here to the<br>
 Virgin Birth of Jesus, but his deity had just been affirmed by<br>
 the words "his Son" <b><i>(\ton huion autou\)</i></b>, so that both his deity<br>
 and humanity are here stated as in <!-#-->Ro 1:3. Whatever view one<br>
 holds about Paul's knowledge of the Virgin Birth of Christ one<br>
 must admit that Paul believed in his actual personal preexistence<br>
 with God <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 8:9; Php 2:5-11)</i></b>, not a mere existence in idea.<br>
 The fact of the Virgin Birth agrees perfectly with the language<br>
 here. <B>{Born under the law}</B> <b><i>(\genomenon hupo nomon\)</i></b>. He not only<br>
 became a man, but a Jew. The purpose <b><i>(\hina\)</i></b> of God thus was<br>
 plainly to redeem <b><i>(\exagoras&#275;i\, as in <!-#-->3:13)</i></b> those under the<br>
 law, and so under the curse. The further purpose <b><i>(\hina\)</i></b> was<br>
 that we <b><i>(Jew and Gentile)</i></b> might receive <b><i>(\apolab&#333;men\, second<br>
 aorist active subjunctive of \apolamban&#333;\)</i></b>, not get back <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 15:27)</i></b>, but get from <b><i>(\apo\)</i></b> God the adoption <b><i>(\t&#275;n<br>
 huiothesian\)</i></b>. Late word common in the inscriptions <b><i>(Deissmann,<br>
 _Bible Studies_, p. 239)</i></b> and occurs in the papyri also and in<br>
 Diogenes Laertes, though not in LXX. Paul adopts this current<br>
 term to express his idea <b><i>(he alone in the N.T.)</i></b> as to how God<br>
 takes into his spiritual family both Jews and Gentiles who<br>
 believe. See also <!-#-->Ro 8:15,23; 9:4; Eph 1:5. The Vulgate uses<br>
 _adoptio filiorum_. It is a metaphor like the others above, but a<br>
 very expressive one.<br>
 <br>
 4:6 <B>{Because ye are sons}</B> <b><i>(\hoti este huioi\)</i></b>. This is the reason<br>
 for sending forth the Son <b><i>(<!-#-->4:4 and here)</i></b>. We were "sons" in<br>
 God's elective purpose and love. \Hoti\ is causal <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 12:15; Ro<br>
 9:7)</i></b>. <B>{The Spirit of his Son}</B> <b><i>(\to pneuma tou huioi autou\)</i></b>. The<br>
 Holy Spirit, called the Spirit of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 8:9f.)</i></b>, the Spirit<br>
 of Jesus Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 1:19)</i></b>. The Holy Spirit proceeds from the<br>
 Father and from the Son <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 15:26)</i></b>. <B>{Crying, Abba, Father}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\krazon Abba ho pat&#275;r\)</i></b>. The participle agrees with \pneuma\<br>
 neuter <b><i>(grammatical gender)</i></b>, not neuter in fact. An old, though<br>
 rare in present as here, onomatopoetic word to croak as a raven<br>
 <b><i>(Theophrastus, like Poe's _The Raven_)</i></b>, any inarticulate cry like<br>
 "the unuttered groanings" of <!-#-->Ro 8:26 which God understands.<br>
 This cry comes from the Spirit of Christ in our hearts. \Abba\ is<br>
 the Aramaic word for father with the article and \ho pat&#275;r\<br>
 translates it. The articular form occurs in the vocative as in<br>
 <!-#-->Joh 20:28. It is possible that the repetition here and in <!-#-->Ro<br>
 8:15 may be "a sort of affectionate fondness for the very term<br>
 that Jesus himself used" <b><i>(Burton)</i></b> in the Garden of Gethsemane<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:36)</i></b>. The rabbis preserve similar parallels. Most of the<br>
 Jews knew both Greek and Aramaic. But there remains the question<br>
 why Jesus used both in his prayer. Was it not natural for both<br>
 words to come to him in his hour of agony as in his childhood?<br>
 The same thing may be true here in Paul's case.<br>
 <br>
 4:7 <B>{No longer a bondservant}</B> <b><i>(\ouketi doulos\)</i></b>. Slave. He<br>
 changes to the singular to drive the point home to each one. The<br>
 spiritual experience <b><i>(<!-#-->3:2)</i></b> has set each one free. Each is now a<br>
 son and heir.<br>
 <br>
 4:8 <B>{To them which by nature are not gods}</B> <b><i>(\tois phusei m&#275; ousi<br>
 theois\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->1Co 10:20 he terms them "demons," the "so-called<br>
 gods" <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 8:5)</i></b>, worshipping images made by hands <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 17:29)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:9 <B>{Now that ye have come to know God}</B> <b><i>(\nun de gnontes\)</i></b>. Fine<br>
 example of the ingressive second aorist active participle of<br>
 \gin&#333;sk&#333;\, come to know by experience through faith in Christ.<br>
 <B>{Rather to be known of God}</B> <b><i>(\mallon de gn&#333;sthentes hupo theou\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive participle of the same verb. He quickly<br>
 turns it round to the standpoint of God's elective grace reaching<br>
 them <b><i>(verse <!-#-->6)</i></b>. <B>{How}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;s\)</i></b>. "A question full of wonder"<br>
 <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>. See <!-#-->1:6. <B>{Turn ye back again?}</B> <b><i>(\epistrephete<br>
 palin?\)</i></b>. Present active indicative, "Are ye turning again?" See<br>
 \metatithesthe\ in <!-#-->1:6. <B>{The weak and beggarly rudiments}</B> <b><i>(\ta<br>
 asthen&#275; kai pt&#333;cha stoicheia\)</i></b>. The same \stoicheia\ in verse <!-#-->3<br>
 from which they had been delivered, "weak and beggarly," still in<br>
 their utter impotence from the Pharisaic legalism and the<br>
 philosophical and religious legalism and the philosophical and<br>
 religious quests of the heathen as shown by Angus's _The<br>
 Religious Quests of the Graeco-Roman World_. These were eagerly<br>
 pursued by many, but they were shadows when caught. It is pitiful<br>
 today to see some men and women leave Christ for will o' the<br>
 wisps of false philosophy. <B>{Over again}</B> <b><i>(\palin an&#333;then\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 word, from above <b><i>(\an&#333;\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Mt 27:51, from the first <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 1:3)</i></b>, then "over again" as here, back to where they were before<br>
 <b><i>(in slavery to rites and rules)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:10 <B>{Ye observe}</B> <b><i>(\parat&#275;reisthe\)</i></b>. Present middle indicative of<br>
 old verb to stand beside and watch carefully, sometimes with evil<br>
 intent as in <!-#-->Lu 6:7, but often with scrupulous care as here <b><i>(so<br>
 in Dio Cassius and Josephus)</i></b>. The meticulous observance of the<br>
 Pharisees Paul knew to a nicety. It hurt him to the quick after<br>
 his own merciful deliverance to see these Gentile Christians<br>
 drawn into this spider-web of Judaizing Christians, once set<br>
 free, now enslaved again. Paul does not itemize the "days"<br>
 <b><i>(Sabbaths, fast-days, feast-days, new moons)</i></b> nor the "months"<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 66:23)</i></b> which were particularly observed in the exile nor<br>
 the "seasons" <b><i>(passover, pentecost, tabernacles, etc.)</i></b> nor the<br>
 "years" <b><i>(sabbatical years every seventh year and the Year of<br>
 Jubilee)</i></b>. Paul does not object to these observances for he kept<br>
 them himself as a Jew. He objected to Gentiles taking to them as<br>
 a means of salvation.<br>
 <br>
 4:11 <B>{I am afraid of you}</B> <b><i>(\phoboumai humas\)</i></b>. He shudders to<br>
 think of it. <B>{Lest by any means I have bestowed labour upon you<br>
 in vain}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; p&#333;s eik&#275;i kekopiaka eis humas\)</i></b>. Usual construction<br>
 after a verb of fearing about what has actually happened <b><i>(\m&#275;<br>
 p&#333;s\ and the perfect active indicative of \kopia&#333;\, to toil<br>
 wearily)</i></b>. A fear about the future would be expressed by the<br>
 subjunctive. Paul fears that the worst has happened.<br>
 <br>
 4:12 <B>{Be as I am}</B> <b><i>(\ginesthe h&#333;s eg&#333;\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 imperative, "Keep on becoming as I am." He will not give them<br>
 over, afraid though he is.<br>
 <br>
 4:13 <B>{Because of an infirmity of the flesh}</B> <b><i>(\di' astheneian t&#275;s<br>
 sarkos\)</i></b>. All that we can get from this statement is the fact<br>
 that Paul's preaching to the Galatians "the first time" or "the<br>
 former time" <b><i>(\to proteron\, adverbial accusative)</i></b> was due to<br>
 sickness of some kind whether it was eye trouble <b><i>(<!-#-->4:15)</i></b> which<br>
 was a trial to them or to the thorn in the flesh <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 12:7)</i></b> we<br>
 do not know. It can be interpreted as applying to North Galatia<br>
 or to South Galatia if he had an attack of malaria on coming up<br>
 from Perga. But the narrative in <!-#-->Ac 13; 14 does not read as if<br>
 Paul had planned to pass by Pisidia and by Lycaonia but for the<br>
 attack of illness. The Galatians understood the allusion for Paul<br>
 says "Ye know" <b><i>(\oidate\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:14 <B>{A temptation to you in my flesh}</B> <b><i>(\ton peirasmon hum&#333;n en<br>
 t&#275;i sarki mou\)</i></b>. "Your temptation <b><i>(or trial)</i></b> in my flesh."<br>
 Peirasmon can be either as we see in <!-#-->Jas 1:2,12ff. If trial<br>
 here, it was a severe one. <B>{Nor rejected}</B> <b><i>(\oude exeptusate\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active indicative of \ekptu&#333;\, old word to spit out<br>
 <b><i>(Homer)</i></b>, to spurn, to loathe. Here only in N.T. Clemen<br>
 <b><i>(_Primitive Christianity_, p. 342)</i></b> thinks it should be taken<br>
 literally here since people spat out as a prophylactic custom at<br>
 the sight of invalids especially epileptics. But Plutarch uses it<br>
 of mere rejection. <B>{As an angel of God}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s aggelon theou\)</i></b>,<br>
 <B>{as Christ Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s Christon I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. In spite of his<br>
 illness and repulsive appearance, whatever it was. Not a mere<br>
 "messenger" of God, but a very angel, even as Christ Jesus. We<br>
 know that at Lystra Paul was at first welcomed as Hermes the god<br>
 of oratory <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 14:12f.)</i></b>. But that narrative hardly applies to<br>
 these words, for they turned against Paul and Barnabas then and<br>
 there at the instigation of Jews from Antioch in Pisidia and<br>
 Iconium.<br>
 <br>
 4:15 <B>{That gratulation of yourselves}</B> <b><i>(\ho makarismos hum&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 "Your felicitation." Rare word from \makariz&#333;\, to pronounce<br>
 happy, in Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch. See also <!-#-->Ro 4:6,9. You no<br>
 longer felicitate yourselves on my presence with you. <B>{Ye would<br>
 have plucked out your eves and given them to me}</B> <b><i>(\tous<br>
 ophthalmous hum&#333;n exoruxantes ed&#333;kate moi\)</i></b>. This is the<br>
 conclusion of a condition of the second class without \an\<br>
 expressed which would have made it clearer. But see <!-#-->Joh<br>
 16:22,24; Ro 7:7 for similar examples where the context makes it<br>
 plain without \an\. It is strong language and is saved from<br>
 hyperbole by "if possible" <b><i>(\ei dunaton\)</i></b>. Did Paul not have at<br>
 this time serious eye trouble?<br>
 <br>
 4:16 <B>{Your enemy}</B> <b><i>(\echthros hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Active sense of \echthros\,<br>
 hater with objective genitive. They looked on Paul now as an<br>
 enemy to them. So the Pharisees and Judaizers generally now<br>
 regarded him. <B>{Because I tell you the truth}</B> <b><i>(\al&#275;theu&#333;n humin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present active participle of \al&#275;theu&#333;\, old verb from \al&#275;th&#275;s\,<br>
 true. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->Eph 4:15. "Speaking the truth." It<br>
 is always a risky business to speak the truth, the whole truth.<br>
 It may hit and hurt.<br>
 <br>
 4:17 <B>{They zealously seek you}</B> <b><i>(\z&#275;lousin humas\)</i></b>. \Z&#275;lo&#333;\ is an<br>
 old and a good word from \z&#275;los\ <b><i>(zeal, jealousy)</i></b>, but one can<br>
 pay court with good motives or evil. So here in contrast with<br>
 Paul's plain speech the Judaizers bring their fawning flattery.<br>
 <B>{To shut you out}</B> <b><i>(\ekkleisai humas\)</i></b>. From Christ as he will<br>
 show <b><i>(<!-#-->5:4)</i></b>. <B>{That ye may seek them}</B> <b><i>(\hina autous z&#275;loute\)</i></b>.<br>
 Probably present active indicative with \hina\ as in<br>
 \phusiousthe\ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 4:6)</i></b> and \gin&#333;skomen\ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Jo 5:20)</i></b>. The<br>
 contraction \-o&#275;te\ would be \-&#333;te\, not \-oute\ <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 325)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:18 <B>{To be zealously sought in a good matter}</B> <b><i>(\z&#275;lousthai en<br>
 kal&#333;i\)</i></b>. Present passive infinitive. It is only in an evil matter<br>
 that it is bad as here <b><i>(\ou kalos\)</i></b>. <B>{When I am present}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i<br>
 pareinai me\)</i></b>. "In the being present as to me."<br>
 <br>
 4:19 <B>{I am in travail}</B> <b><i>(\&#333;din&#333;\)</i></b>. I am in birth pangs. Old word<br>
 for this powerful picture of pain. In N.T. only here, verse <!-#-->27;<br>
 Re 12:2. <B>{Until Christ be formed in you}</B> <b><i>(\mechris hou<br>
 morph&#333;th&#275;i Christos en humin\)</i></b>. Future temporal clause with<br>
 \mechris hou\ <b><i>(until which time)</i></b> and the first aorist passive<br>
 subjunctive of \morpho&#333;\, late and rare verb, in Plutarch, not in<br>
 LXX, not in papyri, only here in N.T. This figure is the embryo<br>
 developing into the child. Paul boldly represents himself as<br>
 again the mother with birth pangs over them. This is better than<br>
 to suppose that the Galatians are pregnant mothers <b><i>(Burton)</i></b> by a<br>
 reversal of the picture as in <!-#-->1Th 2:7.<br>
 <br>
 4:20 <B>{I could with}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;thelon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, I was wishing<br>
 like Agrippa's use of \eboulom&#275;n\ in <!-#-->Ac 25:22, "I was just<br>
 wishing. I was longing to be present with you just now <b><i>(\arti\)</i></b>."<br>
 <B>{To change my voice}</B> <b><i>(\allaxai t&#275;n ph&#333;n&#275;n mou\)</i></b>. Paul could put<br>
 his heart into his voice. The pen stands between them. He knew<br>
 the power of his voice on their hearts. He had tried it before.<br>
 <B>{I am perplexed}</B> <b><i>(\aporoumai\)</i></b>. I am at a loss and know not what<br>
 to do. \Apore&#333;\ is from \a\ privative and \poros\, way. I am lost<br>
 at this distance from you. <B>{About you}</B> <b><i>(\en humin\)</i></b>. In your<br>
 cases. For this use of \en\ see <!-#-->2Co 7:16; Ga 1:24.<br>
 <br>
 4:21 <B>{That desire to be under the law}</B> <b><i>(\hoi hupo nomon thelontes<br>
 einai\)</i></b>. "Under law" <b><i>(no article)</i></b>, as in <!-#-->3:23; 4:4, legalistic<br>
 system. Paul views them as on the point of surrender to legalism,<br>
 as "wanting" <b><i>(\thelontes\)</i></b> to do it <b><i>(<!-#-->1:6; 3:3; 4:11,17)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 makes direct reference to these so disposed to "hear the law." He<br>
 makes a surprising turn, but a legitimate one for the legalists<br>
 by an allegorical use of Scripture.<br>
 <br>
 4:22 <B>{By the handmaid}</B> <b><i>(\ek t&#275;s paidisk&#275;s\)</i></b>. From <!-#-->Ge 16:1.<br>
 Feminine diminutive of \pais\, boy or slave. Common word for<br>
 damsel which came to be used for female slave or maidservant <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 12:45)</i></b> or doorkeeper like <!-#-->Mt 26:29. So in the papyri.<br>
 <br>
 4:23 <B>{Is born}</B> <b><i>(\gegenn&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative of<br>
 \genna&#333;\, stand on record so. <B>{Through promise}</B> <b><i>(\di'<br>
 epaggelias\)</i></b>. In addition to being "after the flesh" <b><i>(\kata<br>
 sarka\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:24 <B>{Which things contain an allegory}</B> <b><i>(\hatina estin<br>
 all&#275;goroumena\)</i></b>. Literally, "Which things are allegorized"<br>
 <b><i>(periphrastic present passive indicative of \all&#275;gore&#333;\)</i></b>. Late<br>
 word <b><i>(Strabo, Plutarch, Philo, Josephus, ecclesiastical writers)</i></b>,<br>
 only here in N.T. The ancient writers used \ainittomai\ to speak<br>
 in riddles. It is compounded of \allo\, another, and \agoreu&#333;\,<br>
 to speak, and so means speaking something else than what the<br>
 language means, what Philo, the past-master in the use of<br>
 allegory, calls the deeper spiritual sense. Paul does not deny<br>
 the actual historical narrative, but he simply uses it in an<br>
 allegorical sense to illustrate his point for the benefit of his<br>
 readers who are tempted to go under the burden of the law. He<br>
 puts a secondary meaning on the narrative just as he uses<br>
 \tupik&#333;s\ in <!-#-->1Co 10:11 of the narrative. We need not press<br>
 unduly the difference between allegory and type, for each is used<br>
 in a variety of ways. The allegory in one sense is a speaking<br>
 parable like Bunyan's _Pilgrim's Progress_, the Prodigal Son in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 15, the Good Shepherd in <!-#-->Joh 10. But allegory was also<br>
 used by Philo and by Paul here for a secret meaning not obvious<br>
 at first, one not in the mind of the writer, like our<br>
 illustration which throws light on the point. Paul was familiar<br>
 with this rabbinical method of exegesis <b><i>(Rabbi Akiba, for<br>
 instance, who found a mystical sense in every hook and crook of<br>
 the Hebrew letters)</i></b> and makes skilful use of that knowledge here.<br>
 Christian preachers in Alexandria early fell victims to Philo's<br>
 allegorical method and carried it to excess without regard to the<br>
 plain sense of the narrative. That startling style of preaching<br>
 survives yet to the discredit of sound preaching. Please observe<br>
 that Paul says here that he is using allegory, not ordinary<br>
 interpretation. It is not necessary to say that Paul intended his<br>
 readers to believe that this allegory was designed by the<br>
 narrative. He illustrates his point by it. <B>{For these are}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hautai gar eisin\)</i></b>. Allegorically interpreted, he means. <B>{From<br>
 Mount Sinai}</B> <b><i>(\apo orous Sin&#257;\)</i></b>. Spoken from Mount Sinai.<br>
 <B>{Bearing}</B> <b><i>(\genn&#333;sa\)</i></b>. Present active participle of \genna&#333;\, to<br>
 beget of the male <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 1:1-16)</i></b>, more rarely as here to bear of<br>
 the female <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:13,57)</i></b>. <B>{Which is Hagar}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;tis estin<br>
 Hagar\)</i></b>. Allegorically interpreted.<br>
 <br>
 4:25 <B>{This Hagar}</B> <b><i>(\to Hagar\)</i></b>. Neuter article and so referring<br>
 to the word Hagar <b><i>(not to the woman, \h&#275;\ Hagar)</i></b> as applied to<br>
 the mountain. There is great variety in the MSS. here. The<br>
 Arabians are descendants of Abraham and Hagar <b><i>(her name meaning<br>
 wanderer or fugitive)</i></b>. <B>{Answereth to}</B> <b><i>(\suntoichei\)</i></b>. Late word<br>
 in Polybius for keeping step in line <b><i>(military term)</i></b> and in<br>
 papyri in figurative sense as here. Lightfoot refers to the<br>
 Pythagorean parallels of opposing principles <b><i>(\sunstoichiai\)</i></b> as<br>
 shown here by Paul <b><i>(Hagar and Sarah, Ishmael and Isaac, the old<br>
 covenant and the new covenant, the earthly Jerusalem and the<br>
 heavenly Jerusalem)</i></b>. That is true, and there is a correlative<br>
 correspondence as the line is carried on.<br>
 <br>
 4:26 <B>{The Jerusalem that is above}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; an&#333; Ierousal&#275;m\)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 uses the rabbinical idea that the heavenly Jerusalem corresponds<br>
 to the one here to illustrate his point without endorsing their<br>
 ideas. See also <!-#-->Re 21:2. He uses the city of Jerusalem to<br>
 represent the whole Jewish race <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:27 <B>{Which is our mother}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;tis estin m&#275;t&#275;r h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. The<br>
 mother of us Christians, apply the allegory of Hagar and Sarah to<br>
 us. The Jerusalem above is the picture of the Kingdom of God.<br>
 Paul illustrates the allegory by quoting <!-#-->Isa 54:1, a song of<br>
 triumph looking for deliverance from a foreign yoke. <B>{Rejoice}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\euphranth&#275;ti\)</i></b>. First aorist passive imperative of \euphrain&#333;\.<br>
 <B>{Break forth}</B> <b><i>(\r&#275;xon\)</i></b>. First aorist active imperative of<br>
 \r&#275;gnumi\, to rend, to burst asunder. Supply \euphrosun&#275;n\ <b><i>(joy)</i></b><br>
 as in <!-#-->Isa 49:13. <B>{The desolate}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;s er&#275;mou\)</i></b>. The prophet<br>
 refers to Sarah's prolonged barrenness and Paul uses this fact as<br>
 a figure for the progress and glory of Christianity <b><i>(the new<br>
 Jerusalem of freedom)</i></b> in contrast with the old Jerusalem of<br>
 bondage <b><i>(the current Judaism)</i></b>. His thought has moved rapidly, but<br>
 he does not lose his line.<br>
 <br>
 4:28 <B>{Now we}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meis de\)</i></b>. Some MSS. have \humeis de\ <b><i>(now ye)</i></b>.<br>
 In either case Paul means that Christians <b><i>(Jews and Gentiles)</i></b> are<br>
 children of the promise as Isaac was <b><i>(\kata Isaak\, after the<br>
 manner of Isaac)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:29 <B>{Persecuted}</B> <b><i>(\edi&#333;ken\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \di&#333;k&#333;\, to<br>
 pursue, to persecute. <!-#-->Ge 21:9 has in Hebrew "laughing," but the<br>
 LXX has "mocking." The Jewish tradition represents Ishmael as<br>
 shooting arrows at Isaac. <B>{So now}</B> <b><i>(\houtos kai nun\)</i></b> the Jews<br>
 were persecuting Paul and all Christians <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 2:15f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:30 <B>{Cast out}</B> <b><i>(\ekbale\)</i></b>. Second aorist active imperative of<br>
 \ekball&#333;\. Quotation from <!-#-->Ge 21:10 <b><i>(Sarah to Abraham)</i></b> and<br>
 confirmed in <!-#-->21:12 by God's command to Abraham. Paul gives<br>
 allegorical warning thus to the persecuting Jews and Judaizers.<br>
 <B>{Shall not inherit}</B> <b><i>(\ou m&#275; kl&#275;ronom&#275;sei\)</i></b>. Strong negative <b><i>(\ou<br>
 m&#275;\ and future indicative)</i></b>. "The law and the gospel cannot<br>
 co-exist. The law must disappear before the gospel" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>.<br>
 See <!-#-->3:18,29 for the word "inherit."<br>
 <br>
 4:31 <B>{But of the freewoman}</B> <b><i>(\alla t&#275;s eleutheras\)</i></b>. We are<br>
 children of Abraham by faith <b><i>(<!-#-->3:7)</i></b>.<br>
