 <HR>
<p>8:1 <B>{Had nothing to eat}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; echont&#333;n ti phag&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute and plural because \ochlou\ a collective substantive.<br>
 Not having what to eat <b><i>(deliberative subjunctive retained in<br>
 indirect question)</i></b>. The repetition of a nature miracle of feeding<br>
 four thousand in Decapolis disturbs some modern critics who<br>
 cannot imagine how Jesus could or would perform another miracle<br>
 elsewhere so similar to the feeding of the five thousand up near<br>
 Bethsaida Julias. But both Mark and Matthew give both miracles,<br>
 distinguish the words for baskets <b><i>(\kophinos, sphuris\)</i></b>, and both<br>
 make Jesus later refer to both incidents and use these two words<br>
 with the same distinction <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 8:19f.; Mt 16:9f.)</i></b>. Surely it is<br>
 easier to conceive that Jesus wrought two such miracles than to<br>
 hold that Mark and Matthew have made such a jumble of the whole<br>
 business.<br>
 <br>
 8:2 <B>{Now three days}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;d&#275; h&#275;merai treis\)</i></b>. This text preserves a<br>
 curious parenthetic nominative of time <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 460)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 15:32.<br>
 <br>
 8:3 <B>{Are come from far}</B> <b><i>(\apo makrothen eisin\)</i></b>. This item alone<br>
 in Mark.<br>
 <br>
 8:4 <B>{Here}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;de\)</i></b>. Of all places, in this desert region in the<br>
 mountains. The disciples feel as helpless as when the five<br>
 thousand were fed. They do not rise to faith in the unlimited<br>
 power of Jesus after all that they have seen.<br>
 <br>
 8:6 <B>{Brake and gave}</B> <b><i>(\eklasen kai edidou\)</i></b>. Constative aorist<br>
 followed by imperfect. The giving kept on. <B>{To set before them}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hina paratith&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Present subjunctive describing the<br>
 continuous process.<br>
 <br>
 8:7 <B>{A few small fishes}</B> <b><i>(\ichthudia oliga\)</i></b>. Mark mentions them<br>
 last as if they were served after the food, but not so <!-#-->Mt<br>
 15:34f.<br>
 <br>
 8:8 <B>{Broken pieces that remained over}</B> <b><i>(\perisseumata<br>
 klasmat&#333;n\)</i></b>. Overplus, abundance, remains of broken pieces not<br>
 used, not just scraps or crumbs.<br>
 <br>
 8:10 <B>{Into the parts of Dalmanutha}</B> <b><i>(\eis ta mer&#275; Dalmanoutha\)</i></b>.<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 15:39 calls it "the borders of Magadan." Both names are<br>
 unknown elsewhere, but apparently the same region of Galilee on<br>
 the western side of the lake not far from Tiberias. Mark here<br>
 uses "parts" <b><i>(\mer&#275;\)</i></b> in the same sense as "borders" <b><i>(\horia\)</i></b> in<br>
 <!-#-->7:24 just as Matthew reverses it with "parts" in <!-#-->Mt 15:21 and<br>
 "borders" here in <!-#-->Mt 15:39. Mark has here "with his disciples"<br>
 <b><i>(\meta t&#333;n math&#275;t&#333;n autou\)</i></b> only implied in <!-#-->Mt 15:39.<br>
 <br>
 8:11 <B>{And the Pharisees came forth}</B> <b><i>(\kai ex&#275;lthon hoi<br>
 Pharisaioi\)</i></b>. At once they met Jesus and opened a controversy.<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 16:1 adds "and Sadducees," the first time these two parties<br>
 appear together against Jesus. See discussion on &#175;Mt 16:1. The<br>
 Pharisees and Herodians had already joined hands against Jesus in<br>
 the sabbath controversy <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 3:6)</i></b>. They <B>{began to question with<br>
 him}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rxanto sunz&#275;tein aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Dispute, not mere inquiry,<br>
 associative instrumental case of \autoi\. They began at once and<br>
 kept it up <b><i>(present infinitive)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:12 <B>{He sighed deeply in his spirit}</B> <b><i>(\anastenaxas t&#333;i<br>
 pneumati\)</i></b>. The only instance of this compound in the N.T. though<br>
 in the LXX. The uncompounded form occurs in <!-#-->Mr 7:34 and it is<br>
 common enough. The preposition \ana-\ intensifies the meaning of<br>
 the verb <b><i>(perfective use)</i></b>. "The sigh seemed to come, as we say,<br>
 from the bottom of his heart, the Lord's human spirit was stirred<br>
 to its depths" <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. Jesus resented the settled prejudice of<br>
 the Pharisees <b><i>(and now Sadducees also)</i></b> against him and his work.<br>
 <B>{There shall no sign be given unto this generation}</B> <b><i>(\ei<br>
 doth&#275;setai t&#275;i gene&#257;i taut&#275;i s&#275;meion\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 16:4 has simply \ou<br>
 doth&#275;setai\, plain negative with the future passive indicative.<br>
 Mark has \ei\ instead of \ou\, which is technically a conditional<br>
 clause with the conclusion unexpressed <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 1024)</i></b>, really aposiopesis in imitation of the Hebrew use of \im\.<br>
 This is the only instance in the N.T. except in quotations from<br>
 the LXX <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 3:11; 4:3,5)</i></b>. It is very common in the LXX. The<br>
 rabbis were splitting hairs over the miracles of Jesus as having<br>
 a possible natural explanation <b><i>(as some critics do today)</i></b> even if<br>
 by the power of Beelzebub, and those not of the sky <b><i>(from heaven)</i></b><br>
 which would be manifested from God. So they put up this fantastic<br>
 test to Jesus which he deeply resents. <!-#-->Mt 16:4 adds "but the<br>
 sign of Jonah" mentioned already by Jesus on a previous occasion<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 12:39-41)</i></b> at more length and to be mentioned again <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 11:32)</i></b>. But the mention of the sign of Jonah was "an absolute<br>
 refusal of signs in their sense" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. And when he did rise<br>
 from the dead on the third day, the Sanhedrin refused to be<br>
 convinced <b><i>(see Acts 3 to 5)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:14 <B>{Bread}</B> <b><i>(\artous\)</i></b>. <B>{Loaves}</B>, plural. <B>{More than one loaf}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ei m&#275; hina arton\)</i></b>. Except one loaf. Detail only in Mark.<br>
 Practically for thirteen men when hungry.<br>
 <br>
 8:15 <B>{Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and the<br>
 leaven of Herod}</B> <b><i>(\Hor&#257;te, blepete apo t&#275;s zum&#275;s t&#333;n Pharisai&#333;n<br>
 kai t&#275;s zum&#275;s H&#275;r&#333;idou\)</i></b>. Present imperatives. Note \apo\ and the<br>
 ablative case. \Zum&#275;\ is from \zumo&#333;\ and occurs already in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 13:33 in a good sense. For the bad sense see <!-#-->1Co 5:6. He<br>
 repeatedly charged <b><i>(\diestelleto\, imperfect indicative)</i></b>, showing<br>
 that the warning was needed. The disciples came out of a<br>
 Pharisaic atmosphere and they had just met it again at<br>
 Dalmanutha. It was insidious. Note the combination of Herod here<br>
 with the Pharisees. This is after the agitation of Herod because<br>
 of the death of the Baptist and the ministry of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 6:14-29; Mt 14:1-12; Lu 9:7-9)</i></b>. Jesus definitely warns the<br>
 disciples against "the leaven of Herod" <b><i>(bad politics)</i></b> and the<br>
 leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees <b><i>(bad theology and also bad<br>
 politics)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:16 <B>{They reasoned one with another}</B> <b><i>(\dielogizonto pros<br>
 all&#275;lous\)</i></b>, implying discussion. Imperfect tense, kept it up. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 16:7 has \en heautois\, in themselves or among themselves.<br>
 <br>
 8:17 Mark here <b><i>(vv. <!-#-->17-20)</i></b> gives six keen questions of Jesus<br>
 while <!-#-->Mt 16:8-11 gives as four that really include the six of<br>
 Mark running some together. The questions reveal the<br>
 disappointment of Jesus at the intellectual dulness of his<br>
 pupils. The questions concern the intellect <b><i>(\noeite\, from<br>
 \nous, suniete\, comprehend)</i></b>, the heart in a <B>{hardened state}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pep&#333;r&#333;men&#275;n\, perfect passive predicate participle as in <!-#-->Mr<br>
 6:52, which see)</i></b>, the eyes, the ears, the memory of both the<br>
 feeding of the five thousand and the four thousand here sharply<br>
 distinguished even to the two kinds of baskets <b><i>(\kophinous,<br>
 sphurid&#333;n\)</i></b>. The disciples did recall the number of baskets left<br>
 over in each instance, twelve and seven. Jesus "administers a<br>
 sharp rebuke for their preoccupation with mere temporalities, as<br>
 if there were nothing higher to be thought of _than bread_"<br>
 <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. "For the time the Twelve are way-side hearers, with<br>
 hearts like a beaten path, into which the higher truths cannot<br>
 sink so as to germinate" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:18 See on &#175;17.<br>
 <br>
 8:19 See on &#175;17.<br>
 <br>
 8:20 See on &#175;17.<br>
 <br>
 8:21 <B>{Do ye not yet understand?}</B> <b><i>(\oup&#333; suniete;\)</i></b>. After all<br>
 this rebuke and explanation. The greatest of all teachers had the<br>
 greatest of all classes, but he struck a snag here. <!-#-->Mt 16:12<br>
 gives the result: "Then they understood how that he bade them not<br>
 beware of the loaves of bread, but of the teaching of the<br>
 Pharisees and Sadducees." They had once said that they understood<br>
 the parables of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 13:51)</i></b>. But that was a long time ago.<br>
 The teacher must have patience if his pupils are to understand.<br>
 <br>
 8:22 <B>{Unto Bethsaida}</B> <b><i>(\eis B&#275;thsaidan\)</i></b>. On the Eastern side not<br>
 far from the place of the feeding of the five thousand, Bethsaida<br>
 Julias. Note dramatic presents <B>{they come}</B> <b><i>(\erchontai\)</i></b>, <B>{they<br>
 bring}</B> <b><i>(\pherousin\)</i></b>. This incident in Mark alone <b><i>(verses<br>
 <!-#-->22-26)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:23 <B>{Brought him out of the village}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#275;negken auton ex&#333; t&#275;s<br>
 k&#333;m&#275;s\)</i></b>. It had been a village, but Philip had enlarged it and<br>
 made it a town or city <b><i>(\polis\)</i></b>, though still called a village<br>
 <b><i>(verses <!-#-->23,26)</i></b>. As in the case of the deaf and dumb demoniac<br>
 given also alone by Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 7:31-37)</i></b>, so here Jesus observes<br>
 the utmost secrecy in performing the miracle for reasons not<br>
 given by Mark. It was the season of retirement and Jesus is<br>
 making the fourth withdrawal from Galilee. That fact may explain<br>
 it. The various touches here are of interest also. Jesus led him<br>
 out by the hand, put spittle on his eyes <b><i>(using the poetical and<br>
 _Koin&#275;_ papyri word \ommata\ instead of the usual \opthalmous\)</i></b>,<br>
 and laid his hands upon him, perhaps all this to help the man's<br>
 faith.<br>
 <br>
 8:24 <B>{I see men, for I behold them as trees walking}</B> <b><i>(\Blep&#333; tous<br>
 anthr&#333;pous hoti h&#333;s dendra hor&#333; peripatountas\)</i></b>. A vivid<br>
 description of dawning sight. His vision was incomplete though he<br>
 could tell that they were men because they were walking. This is<br>
 the single case of a gradual cure in the healings wrought by<br>
 Jesus. The reason for this method in this case is not given.<br>
 <br>
 8:25 <B>{He looked steadfastly}</B> <b><i>(\dieblepsen\)</i></b>. He saw thoroughly<br>
 now, effective aorist <b><i>(\dieblepsen\)</i></b>, he was completely restored<br>
 <b><i>(\apekatest&#275;\, second aorist, double compound and double<br>
 augment)</i></b>, and kept on seeing <b><i>(\eneblepen\, imperfect, continued<br>
 action)</i></b> all things clearly or at a distance <b><i>(\t&#275;laug&#333;s\, common<br>
 Greek word from \t&#275;le\, afar, and \aug&#275;\, radiance, far-shining)</i></b>.<br>
 Some manuscripts <b><i>(margin in Westcott and Hort)</i></b> read \d&#275;laug&#333;s\,<br>
 from \d&#275;los\, plain, and \aug&#275;\, radiance.<br>
 <br>
 8:26 <B>{To his home}</B> <b><i>(\eis oikon autou\)</i></b>. A joyful homecoming that.<br>
 He was not allowed to enter the village and create excitement<br>
 before Jesus moved on to Caesarea Philippi.<br>
 <br>
 8:27 <B>{Into the villages of Caesarea Philippi}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#257;s k&#333;mas<br>
 Kaisari&#257;s t&#275;s Philippou\)</i></b>. Parts <b><i>(\mer&#275;\)</i></b> <!-#-->Mt 16:13 has, the<br>
 Caesarea of Philippi in contrast to the one down on the<br>
 Mediterranean Sea. Mark means the villages belonging to the<br>
 district around Caesarea Philippi. This region is on a spur of<br>
 Mount Hermon in Iturea ruled by Herod Philip so that Jesus is<br>
 safe from annoyance by Herod Antipas or the Pharisees and<br>
 Sadducees. Up here on this mountain slope Jesus will have his<br>
 best opportunity to give the disciples special teaching<br>
 concerning the crucifixion just a little over six months ahead.<br>
 So Jesus asked <b><i>(\ep&#275;r&#333;t&#257;\, descriptive imperfect)</i></b> <B>{Who do men say<br>
 that I am?}</B> <b><i>(\Tina me legousin hoi anthr&#333;poi einai;\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 16:13<br>
 has "the Son of Man" in place of "I" here in Mark and in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 9:18. He often described himself as "the Son of Man." Certainly<br>
 here the phrase could not mean merely "a man." They knew the<br>
 various popular opinions about Jesus of which Herod Antipas had<br>
 heard <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 3:21,31)</i></b>. It was time that the disciples reveal how<br>
 much they had been influenced by their environment as well as by<br>
 the direct instruction of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 8:28 <B>{And they told him}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de eipan\)</i></b>. They knew only too<br>
 well. See on &#175;Mt 16:14,28 for discussion.<br>
 <br>
 8:29 <B>{Thou art the Christ}</B> <b><i>(\Su ei ho Christos\)</i></b>. Mark does not<br>
 give "the Son of the living God" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 16:16)</i></b> or "of God" <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 9:20)</i></b>. The full confession is the form in Matthew. Luke's<br>
 language means practically the same, while Mark's is the<br>
 briefest. But the form in Mark really means the full idea. Mark<br>
 omits all praise of Peter, probably because Peter had done so in<br>
 his story of the incident. For criticism of the view that<br>
 Matthew's narrative is due to ecclesiastical development and<br>
 effort to justify ecclesiastical prerogatives, see discussion on<br>
 &#175;Mt 16:16,18. The disciples had confessed him as Messiah before.<br>
 Thus <!-#-->Joh 1:41; 4:29; 6:69; Mt 14:33. But Jesus had ceased to<br>
 use the word Messiah to avoid political complications and a<br>
 revolutionary movement <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:14f.)</i></b>. But did the disciples<br>
 still believe in Jesus as Messiah after all the defections and<br>
 oppositions seen by them? It was a serious test to which Jesus<br>
 now put them.<br>
 <br>
 8:30 <B>{Of him}</B> <b><i>(\peri autou\)</i></b>. As being the Messiah, that he was<br>
 the Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 16:20)</i></b>. Not yet, for the time was not yet ripe.<br>
 When that comes, the triumphal entry into Jerusalem, the very<br>
 stones will cry out, if men will not <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 19:40)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:31 <B>{He began to teach them}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rxato didaskein autous\)</i></b>. Mark<br>
 is fond of this idiom, but it is not a mere rhetorical device.<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 16:21 expressly says "from that time." They had to be told<br>
 soon about the approaching death of Jesus. The confession of<br>
 faith in Jesus indicated that it was a good time to begin. Death<br>
 at the hands of the Sanhedrin <b><i>(elders, chief priests, and<br>
 scribes)</i></b> in which Pharisees and Sadducees had about equal<br>
 strength. The resurrection on the third day is mentioned, but it<br>
 made no impression on their minds. This rainbow on the cloud was<br>
 not seen. <B>{After three days}</B> <b><i>(\meta treis h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 16:21<br>
 has "the third day" <b><i>(\t&#275;i trit&#275;i h&#275;mer&#257;i\)</i></b> in the locative case<br>
 of point of time <b><i>(so also <!-#-->Lu 9:22)</i></b>. There are some people who<br>
 stickle for a strict interpretation of "after three days" which<br>
 would be "on the fourth day," not "on the third day." Evidently<br>
 Mark's phrase here has the same sense as that in Matthew and Luke<br>
 else they are hopelessly contradictory. In popular language<br>
 "after three days" can and often does mean "on the third day,"<br>
 but the fourth day is impossible.<br>
 <br>
 8:32 <B>{Spake the saying openly}</B> <b><i>(\parr&#275;si&#257;i ton logon elalei\)</i></b>. He<br>
 held back nothing, told it all <b><i>(\p&#257;n\, all, \r&#275;sia\, from<br>
 \eipon\, say)</i></b>, without reserve, to all of them. Imperfect tense<br>
 \elalei\ shows that Jesus did it repeatedly. Mark alone gives<br>
 this item. Mark does not give the great eulogy of Peter in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 16:17,19 after his confession <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 8:29; Mt 16:16; Lu 9:20)</i></b>,<br>
 but he does tell the stinging rebuke given Peter by Jesus on this<br>
 occasion. See discussion on &#175;Mt 16:21,26.<br>
 <br>
 8:33 <B>{He turning about and seeing his disciples}</B> <b><i>(\epistrapheis<br>
 kai id&#333;n tous math&#275;t&#257;s autou\)</i></b>. Peter had called Jesus off to<br>
 himself <b><i>(\proskalesamenos\)</i></b>, but Jesus quickly wheeled round on<br>
 Peter <b><i>(\epistrapheis\, only \strapheis\ in Matthew)</i></b>. In doing<br>
 that the other disciples were in plain view also <b><i>(this touch only<br>
 in Mark)</i></b>. Hence Jesus rebukes Peter in the full presence of the<br>
 whole group. Peter no doubt felt that it was his duty as a leader<br>
 of the Twelve to remonstrate with the Master for this pessimistic<br>
 utterance <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. It is even possible that the others shared<br>
 Peter's views and were watching the effect of his daring rebuke<br>
 of Jesus. It was more than mere officiousness on the part of<br>
 Peter. He had not risen above the level of ordinary men and<br>
 deserves the name of Satan whose role he was now acting. It was<br>
 withering, but it was needed. The temptation of the devil on the<br>
 mountain was here offered by Peter. It was Satan over again. See<br>
 on &#175;Mt 16:23.<br>
 <br>
 8:34 <B>{And he called unto him the multitude with his disciples}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai proskalesamenos ton ochlon sun tois math&#275;tais autou\)</i></b>. Mark<br>
 alone notes the unexpected presence of a crowd up here near<br>
 Caesarea Philippi in heathen territory. In the presence of this<br>
 crowd Jesus explains his philosophy of life and death which is in<br>
 direct contrast with that offered by Peter and evidently shared<br>
 by the disciples and the people. So Jesus gives this profound<br>
 view of life and death to them all. <B>{Deny himself}</B> <b><i>(\aparn&#275;sasth&#333;<br>
 heauton\)</i></b>. Say no to himself, a difficult thing to do. Note<br>
 reflexive along with the middle voice. Ingressive first aorist<br>
 imperative. See on &#175;Mt 16:24 about taking up the Cross. The<br>
 shadow of Christ's Cross was already on him <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 8:31)</i></b> and one<br>
 faces everyone.<br>
 <br>
 8:35 <B>{And the gospel's sake}</B> <b><i>(\kai tou euaggeliou\)</i></b>. In Mark<br>
 alone. See on &#175;Mt 16:25f. for this paradox. Two senses of "life"<br>
 and "save." For the last "save" <b><i>(\s&#333;sei\)</i></b> <!-#-->Mt 16:25 has "find"<br>
 <b><i>(\heur&#275;sei\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 16:26 for "gain," "profit," and<br>
 "exchange."<br>
 <br>
 8:38 <B>{For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and my words}</B> <b><i>(\hos<br>
 gar ean epaischunth&#275;i me kai tous emous logous\)</i></b>. More exactly,<br>
 <B>{whosoever is ashamed}</B> <b><i>(first aorist passive subjunctive with<br>
 indefinite relative and \ean = an\. See Robertson, _Grammar_, pp.<br>
 957-9.)</i></b> It is not a statement about the future conduct of one, but<br>
 about his present attitude toward Jesus. The conduct of men<br>
 toward Christ now determines Christ's conduct then<br>
 <b><i>(\epaischunth&#275;setai\, first future passive indicative)</i></b>. This<br>
 passive verb is transitive and uses the accusative <b><i>(\me, auton\)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{In this adulterous and sinful generation}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i gene&#257;i taut&#275;i<br>
 t&#275;i moichalidi kai hamart&#333;l&#333;i\)</i></b>. Only in Mark. <B>{When he cometh}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hotan elth&#275;i\)</i></b>. Aorist active subjunctive with reference to the<br>
 future second coming of Christ with the glory of the Father with<br>
 his holy angels <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mt 16:27)</i></b>. This is a clear prediction of<br>
 the final eschatological coming of Christ. This verse could not<br>
 be separated from <!-#-->Mr 9:1 as the chapter division does. These<br>
 two verses in <!-#-->Mr 8:38; 9:1 form one paragraph and should go<br>
 together.<br>
