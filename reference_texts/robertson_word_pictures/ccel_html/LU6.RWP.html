<p>6:1 <B>{On a sabbath}</B> <b><i>(\en sabbat&#333;i\)</i></b>. This is the second sabbath on<br>
 which Jesus is noted by Luke. The first was <!-#-->Lu 4:31-41. There<br>
 was another in <!-#-->Joh 5:1-47. There is Western and Syrian<br>
 <b><i>(Byzantine)</i></b> evidence for a very curious reading here which calls<br>
 this sabbath "secondfirst" <b><i>(\deuteropr&#333;t&#333;i\)</i></b>. It is undoubtedly<br>
 spurious, though Westcott and Hort print it in the margin. A<br>
 possible explanation is that a scribe wrote "first" <b><i>(\pr&#333;t&#333;i\)</i></b> on<br>
 the margin because of the sabbath miracle in <!-#-->Lu 6:6-11. Then<br>
 another scribe recalled <!-#-->Lu 4:31 where a sabbath is mentioned<br>
 and wrote "second" <b><i>(\deuter&#333;i\)</i></b> also on the margin. Finally a<br>
 third scribe combined the two in the word \deuteropr&#333;t&#333;i\ that is<br>
 not found elsewhere. If it were genuine, we should not know what<br>
 it means. <B>{Plucked}</B> <b><i>(\etillon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. They were<br>
 plucking as they went on through <b><i>(\diaporeuesthai\)</i></b>. Whether<br>
 wheat or barley, we do not know, not our "corn" <b><i>(maize)</i></b>. <B>{Did<br>
 eat}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;sthion\)</i></b>. Imperfect again. See on &#175;Mt 12:1f.; Mr 2:23f.<br>
 for the separate acts in supposed violence of the sabbath laws.<br>
 <B>{Rubbing them in their hands}</B> <b><i>(\ps&#333;chontes tais chersin\)</i></b>. Only<br>
 in Luke and only here in the N.T. This was one of the chief<br>
 offences. "According to Rabbinical notions, it was reaping,<br>
 threshing, winnowing, and preparing food all at once" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 These Pharisees were straining out gnats and swallowing camels!<br>
 This verb \ps&#333;ch&#333;\ is a late one for \psa&#333;\, to rub.<br>
 <br>
 6:3 <B>{Not even this}</B> <b><i>(\oude touto\)</i></b>. This small point only in<br>
 Luke. <B>{What}</B> <b><i>(\ho\)</i></b>. Literally, <B>{which}</B>. <!-#-->Mr 2:25; Mt 12:3 have<br>
 \ti\ <b><i>(what)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:4 <B>{Did take}</B> <b><i>(\lab&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of<br>
 \lamban&#333;\. Not in Mark and Matthew. See <!-#-->Mt 12:1-8; Mr 2:23-28<br>
 for discussion of details about the shewbread and the five<br>
 arguments in defence of his conduct on the sabbath <b><i>(example of<br>
 David, work of the priests on the sabbath, prophecy of <!-#-->Ho 6:6,<br>
 purpose of the sabbath for man, the Son of Man lord of the<br>
 sabbath)</i></b>. It was an overwhelming and crushing reply to these<br>
 pettifogging ceremonialists to which they could not reply, but<br>
 which increased their anger. Codex D transfers verse <!-#-->5 to after<br>
 verse <!-#-->10 and puts here the following: "On the same day<br>
 beholding one working on the sabbath he said to him: Man, if you<br>
 know what you are doing, happy are you; but if you do not know,<br>
 cursed are you and a transgressor of the law."<br>
 <br>
 6:6 <B>{On another sabbath}</B> <b><i>(\en heter&#333;i sabbat&#333;i\)</i></b>. This was a<br>
 second <b><i>(\heteron\, as it often means)</i></b>, but not necessarily the<br>
 next, sabbath. This incident is given by all three synoptics <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 3:1-6; Mt 12:9-14; Lu 6:6-11)</i></b>. See Matt. and Mark for details.<br>
 Only Luke notes that it was on a sabbath. Was this because Luke<br>
 as a physician had to meet this problem in his own practise?<br>
 <B>{Right hand}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; dexia\)</i></b>. This alone in Luke, the physician's<br>
 eye for particulars.<br>
 <br>
 6:7 <B>{The scribes and the Pharisees}</B> <b><i>(\hoi grammateis kai hoi<br>
 Pharisaioi\)</i></b>. Only Luke here though Pharisees named in <!-#-->Mt 12:14<br>
 and Pharisees and Herodians in <!-#-->Mr 3:6. <B>{Watched him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\paret&#275;rounto auton\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, were watching for<br>
 themselves on the side <b><i>(\para\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr 3:2 has the imperfect<br>
 active \paret&#275;roun\. Common verb, but the proposition \para\ gave<br>
 an extra touch, watching either assiduously like the physician at<br>
 the bedside or insidiously with evil intent as here. <B>{Would heal}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\therapeusei\)</i></b>. But the present active indicative <b><i>(\therapeuei\)</i></b><br>
 may be the correct text here. So Westcott and Hort. <B>{That they<br>
 might find out how to accuse him}</B> <b><i>(\hina heur&#333;sin kat&#275;gorein<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. Second aorist active subjunctive of \heurisk&#333;\ and the<br>
 infinitive with it means to find out how to do a thing. They were<br>
 determined to make a case against Jesus. They felt sure that<br>
 their presence would prevent any spurious work on the part of<br>
 Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 6:8 <B>{But he knew their thoughts}</B> <b><i>(\autos de &#275;idei tous<br>
 dialogismous aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. In Luke alone. Imperfect in sense, second<br>
 past perfect in form \&#275;idei\ from \oida\. Jesus, in contrast to<br>
 these spies <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>, read their intellectual processes like an<br>
 open book. <B>{His hand withered}</B> <b><i>(\x&#275;ran t&#275;n cheira\)</i></b>. Predicate<br>
 position of the adjective. So in <!-#-->Mr 3:3. <B>{Stand forth}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\st&#275;thi\)</i></b>. Luke alone has this verb, second aorist active<br>
 imperative. <!-#-->Mr 3:3 has <B>{Arise into the midst}</B> <b><i>(\egeire eis to<br>
 meson\)</i></b>. Luke has <B>{Arise and step forth into the midst}</B> <b><i>(\egeire<br>
 kai st&#275;thi eis to meson\)</i></b>. Christ worked right out in the open<br>
 where all could see. It was a moment of excitement when the man<br>
 stepped forth <b><i>(\est&#275;\)</i></b> there before them all.<br>
 <br>
 6:9 <B>{I ask you}</B> <b><i>(\eper&#333;t&#333; hum&#257;s\)</i></b>. They had questions in their<br>
 hearts about Jesus. He now asks in addition <b><i>(\ep'\)</i></b> an open<br>
 question that brings the whole issue into the open. <B>{A life}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\psuch&#275;n\)</i></b>. So the Revised Version. The rabbis had a rule:<br>
 _Periculum vitae pellit sabbatum_. But it had to be a Jew whose<br>
 life was in peril on the sabbath. The words of Jesus cut to the<br>
 quick. <B>{Or to destroy it}</B> <b><i>(\&#275; apolesai\)</i></b>. On this very day these<br>
 Pharisees were plotting to destroy Jesus <b><i>(verse <!-#-->7)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:10 <B>{He looked round about on them all}</B> <b><i>(\periblepsamenos\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist middle participle as in <!-#-->Mr 3:5, the middle voice<br>
 giving a personal touch to it all. Mark adds "with anger" which<br>
 Luke here does not put in. All three Gospels have the identical<br>
 command: <B>{Stretch forth thy hand}</B> <b><i>(\exteinon t&#275;n cheira sou\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active imperative. <B>{Stretch out}</B>, clean out, full<br>
 length. All three Gospels also have the first aorist passive<br>
 indicative \apekatestath&#275;\ with the double augment of the double<br>
 compound verb \apokathist&#275;mi\. As in Greek writers, so here the<br>
 double compound means complete restoration to the former state.<br>
 <br>
 6:11 <B>{They were filled with madness}</B> <b><i>(\epl&#275;sth&#275;san anoias\)</i></b> First<br>
 aorist passive <b><i>(effective)</i></b> with genitive: In <!-#-->5:26 we saw the<br>
 people filled with fear. Here is rage that is kin to insanity,<br>
 for \anoias\ is lack of sense <b><i>(\a\ privative and \nous\, mind)</i></b>.<br>
 An old word, but only here and <!-#-->2Ti 3:9 in the N.T. <B>{Communed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dielaloun\)</i></b>, imperfect active, picturing their excited<br>
 counsellings with one another. <!-#-->Mr 3:6 notes that they bolted<br>
 out of the synagogue and outside plotted even with the Herodians<br>
 how to destroy Jesus, strange co-conspirators these against the<br>
 common enemy. <B>{What they might do to Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\ti an poi&#275;saien<br>
 I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. Luke puts it in a less damaging way than <!-#-->Mr 3:6; Mt<br>
 12:14. This aorist optative with \an\ is the deliberative<br>
 question like that in <!-#-->Ac 17:18 retained in the indirect form<br>
 here. Perhaps Luke means, not that they were undecided about<br>
 killing Jesus, but only as to the best way of doing it. Already<br>
 nearly two years before the end we see the set determination to<br>
 destroy Jesus. We see it here in Galilee. We have already seen it<br>
 at the feast in Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 5:18)</i></b> where "the Jews sought the<br>
 more to kill him." John and the Synoptics are in perfect<br>
 agreement as to the Pharisaic attitude toward Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 6:12 <B>{He went out into the mountains to pray}</B> <b><i>(\exelthein auton<br>
 eis to oros proseuxasthai\)</i></b>. Note \ex-\ where <!-#-->Mr 3:13 has<br>
 <B>{goeth up}</B> <b><i>(\anabainei\)</i></b>. Luke alone has "to pray" as he so often<br>
 notes the habit of prayer in Jesus. <B>{He continued all night}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n<br>
 dianuktereu&#333;n\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect active. Here alone in the<br>
 N.T., but common in the LXX and in late Greek writers. Medical<br>
 writers used it of whole night vigils. <B>{In prayer to God}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 t&#275;i proseuch&#275;i tou theou\)</i></b>. Objective genitive \tou theou\. This<br>
 phrase occurs nowhere else. \Proseuch&#275;\ does not mean "place of<br>
 prayer" or synagogue as in <!-#-->Ac 16:13, but the actual prayer of<br>
 Jesus to the Father all night long. He needed the Father's<br>
 guidance now in the choice of the Apostles in the morning.<br>
 <br>
 6:13 <B>{When it was day}</B> <b><i>(\hote egeneto h&#275;mera\)</i></b>. When day came,<br>
 after the long night of prayer. <B>{He chose from them twelve}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eklexamenos ap' aut&#333;n d&#333;deka\)</i></b>. The same root <b><i>(\leg\)</i></b> was used<br>
 for picking out, selecting and then for saying. There was a large<br>
 group of "disciples" or "learners" whom he "called" to him<br>
 <b><i>(\proseph&#333;n&#275;sen\)</i></b>, and from among whom he chose <b><i>(of himself, and<br>
 for himself, indirect middle voice (\eklexamenos\)</i></b>. It was a<br>
 crisis in the work of Christ. Jesus assumed full responsibility<br>
 even for the choice of Judas who was not forced upon Jesus by the<br>
 rest of the Twelve. "You did not choose me, but I chose you,"<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 15:16)</i></b> where Jesus uses \exelexasthe\ and \exelexam&#275;n\ as<br>
 here by Luke. <B>{Whom also he named apostles}</B> <b><i>(\hous kai apostolous<br>
 &#333;nomasen\)</i></b>. So then Jesus gave the twelve chosen disciples this<br>
 appellation. Aleph and B have these same words in <!-#-->Mr 3:14<br>
 besides the support of a few of the best cursives, the Bohairic<br>
 Coptic Version and the Greek margin of the Harclean Syriac.<br>
 Westcott and Hort print them in their text in <!-#-->Mr 3:14, but it<br>
 remains doubtful whether they were not brought into Mark from <!-#-->Lu<br>
 6:13 where they are undoubtedly genuine. See <!-#-->Mt 10:2 where the<br>
 connection with sending them out by twos in the third tour of<br>
 Galilee. The word is derived from \apostell&#333;\, to send <b><i>(Latin,<br>
 _mitto_)</i></b> and apostle is missionary, one sent. Jesus applies the<br>
 term to himself <b><i>(\apesteilas\, <!-#-->Joh 17:3)</i></b> as does <!-#-->Heb 3:1. The<br>
 word is applied to others, like Barnabas, besides these twelve<br>
 including the Apostle Paul who is on a par with them in rank and<br>
 authority, and even to mere messengers of the churches <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co<br>
 8:23)</i></b>. But these twelve apostles stand apart from all others in<br>
 that they were all chosen at once by Jesus himself "that they<br>
 might be with him" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 3:14)</i></b>, to be trained by Jesus himself<br>
 and to interpret him and his message to the world. In the nature<br>
 of the case they could have no successors as they had to be<br>
 personal witnesses to the life and resurrection of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 1:22)</i></b>. The selection of Matthias to succeed Judas cannot be<br>
 called a mistake, but it automatically ceased. For discussion of<br>
 the names and groups in the list see discussion on &#175;Mt 10:1-4; Mr<br>
 3:14-19.<br>
 <br>
 6:16 <B>{Which was the traitor}</B> <b><i>(\hos egeneto prodot&#275;s\)</i></b>. Who became<br>
 traitor, more exactly, \egeneto\, not \&#275;n\. He gave no signs of<br>
 treachery when chosen.<br>
 <br>
 6:17 <B>{He came down with them}</B> <b><i>(\katabas met' aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active participle of \katabain&#333;\, common verb. This was<br>
 the night of prayer up in the mountain <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 31:3; Lu 6:12)</i></b> and<br>
 the choice of the Twelve next morning. The going up into the<br>
 mountain of <!-#-->Mt 5:1 may simply be a summary statement with no<br>
 mention of what Luke has explained or may be a reference to the<br>
 elevation, where he "sat down" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:1)</i></b>, above the plain or<br>
 "level place" <b><i>(\epi topou pedinou\)</i></b> on the mountain side where<br>
 Jesus "stood" or "stopped" <b><i>(\est&#275;\)</i></b>. It may be a level place<br>
 towards the foot of the mountain. He stopped his descent at this<br>
 level place and then found a slight elevation on the mountain<br>
 side and began to speak. There is not the slightest reason for<br>
 making Matthew locate this sermon on the mountain and Luke in the<br>
 valley as if the places, audiences, and topics were different.<br>
 For the unity of the sermon see discussion on &#175;Mt 5:1f. The<br>
 reports in Matthew and Luke begin alike, cover the same general<br>
 ground and end alike. The report in Matthew is longer chiefly<br>
 because in Chapter 5, he gives the argument showing the contrast<br>
 between Christ's conception of righteousness and that of the<br>
 Jewish rabbis. Undoubtedly, Jesus repeated many of the crisp<br>
 sayings here at other times as in Luke 12, but it is quite<br>
 gratuitous to argue that Matthew and Luke have made up this<br>
 sermon out of isolated sayings of Christ at various times. Both<br>
 Matthew and Luke give too much that is local of place and<br>
 audience for that idea. <!-#-->Mt 5:1 speaks of "the multitudes" and<br>
 "his disciples." <!-#-->Lu 6:17 notes "a great multitude of his<br>
 disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and<br>
 Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon." They agree in<br>
 the presence of disciples and crowds besides the disciples from<br>
 whom the twelve apostles were chosen. It is important to note how<br>
 already people were coming from "the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon"<br>
 "to hear him and to be healed <b><i>(\iath&#275;nai\, first aorist passive<br>
 of \iaomai\)</i></b> of their diseases."<br>
 <br>
 6:18 <B>{With unclean spirits}</B> <b><i>(\apo pneumat&#333;n akathart&#333;n\)</i></b> . In an<br>
 amphibolous position for it can be construed with "troubled,"<br>
 <b><i>(present passive participle \enochloumenoi\)</i></b> or with "were<br>
 healed" <b><i>(imperfect passive, \etherapeuonto\)</i></b>. The healings were<br>
 repeated as often as they came. Note here both verbs, \iaomai\<br>
 and \therapeu&#333;\, used of the miraculous cures of Jesus.<br>
 \Therapeu&#333;\ is the verb more commonly employed of regular<br>
 professional cures, but no such distinction is made here.<br>
 <br>
 6:19 <B>{Sought to touch him}</B> <b><i>(\ez&#275;toun haptesthai autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active. One can see the surging, eager crowd pressing<br>
 up to Jesus. Probably some of them felt that there was a sort of<br>
 virtue or magic in touching his garments like the poor woman in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 8:43f. <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 5:23; Mt 9:21)</i></b>. <B>{For power came forth from him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hoti dunamis par' autou ex&#275;rcheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, <B>{power<br>
 was coming out from him}</B>. This is the reason for the continual<br>
 approach to Jesus. <B>{And healed them all}</B> <b><i>(\kai i&#257;to pantas\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect middle again. Was healing all, kept on healing all. The<br>
 preacher today who is not a vehicle of power from Christ to men<br>
 may well question why that is true. Undoubtedly the failure to<br>
 get a blessing is one reason why many people stop going to<br>
 church. One may turn to Paul's tremendous words in <!-#-->Php 4:13: "I<br>
 have strength for all things in him who keeps on pouring power<br>
 into me" <b><i>(\panta ischu&#333; en t&#333;i endunamounti me\)</i></b>. It was at a<br>
 time of surpassing dynamic spiritual energy when Jesus delivered<br>
 this greatest of all sermons so far as they are reported to us.<br>
 The very air was electric with spiritual power. There are such<br>
 times as all preachers know.<br>
 <br>
 6:20 <B>{And he lifted up his eyes}</B> <b><i>(\kai autos eparas tous<br>
 opthalmous autou\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle from \epair&#333;\.<br>
 Note also Luke's favourite use of \kai autos\ in beginning a<br>
 paragraph. Vivid detail alone in Luke. Jesus looked the vast<br>
 audience full in the face. <!-#-->Mt 5:2 mentions that "he opened his<br>
 mouth and taught them" <b><i>(began to teach them, inchoative<br>
 imperfect, \edidasken\)</i></b>. He spoke out so that the great crowd<br>
 could hear. Some preachers do not open their mouths and do not<br>
 look up at the people, but down at the manuscript and drawl along<br>
 while the people lose interest and even go to sleep or slip out.<br>
 <B>{Ye poor}</B> <b><i>(\hoi pt&#333;choi\)</i></b>. <B>{The poor}</B>, but "yours" <b><i>(\humetera\)</i></b><br>
 justifies the translation "ye." Luke's report is direct address<br>
 in all the four beatitudes and four woes given by him. It is<br>
 useless to speculate why Luke gives only four of the eight<br>
 beatitudes in Matthew or why Matthew does not give the four woes<br>
 in Luke. One can only say that neither professes to give a<br>
 complete report of the sermon. There is no evidence to show that<br>
 either saw the report of the other. They may have used a common<br>
 source like Q <b><i>(the Logia of Jesus)</i></b> or they may have had separate<br>
 sources. Luke's first beatitude corresponds with Matthew's first,<br>
 but he does not have "in spirit" after "poor." Does Luke<br>
 represent Jesus as saying that poverty itself is a blessing? It<br>
 can be made so. Or does Luke represent Jesus as meaning what is<br>
 in Matthew, poverty of spirit? <B>{The kingdom of God}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; basileia<br>
 tou theou\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 5:3 has "the kingdom of heaven" which occurs<br>
 alone in Matthew though he also has the one here in Luke with no<br>
 practical difference. The rabbis usually said "the kingdom of<br>
 heaven." They used it of the political Messianic kingdom when<br>
 Judaism of the Pharisaic sort would triumph over the world. The<br>
 idea of Jesus is in the sharpest contrast to that conception here<br>
 and always. See on &#175;Mt 3:2 for discussion of the meaning of the<br>
 word "kingdom." It is the favourite word of Jesus for the rule of<br>
 God in the heart here and now. It is both present and future and<br>
 will reach a glorious consummation. Some of the sayings of Christ<br>
 have apocalyptic and eschatological figures, but the heart of the<br>
 matter is here in the spiritual reality of the reign of God in<br>
 the hearts of those who serve him. The kingdom parables expand<br>
 and enlarge upon various phases of this inward life and growth.<br>
 <br>
 6:21 <B>{Now}</B> <b><i>(\nun\)</i></b>. Luke adds this adverb here and in the next<br>
 sentence after "weep." This sharpens the contrast between present<br>
 sufferings and the future blessings. <B>{Filled}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\chortasth&#275;sesthe\)</i></b>. Future passive indicative. The same verb in<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 5:6. Originally it was used for giving fodder <b><i>(\chortos\)</i></b> to<br>
 animals, but here it is spiritual fodder or food except in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 15:16; 16:21. Luke here omits "and thirst after righteousness."<br>
 <B>{Weep}</B> <b><i>(\klaiontes\)</i></b>. Audible weeping. Where <!-#-->Mt 5:4 has "mourn"<br>
 <b><i>(\penthountes\)</i></b>. <B>{Shall laugh}</B> <b><i>(\gelasete\)</i></b>. Here <!-#-->Mt 5:4 has<br>
 "shall be comforted." Luke's words are terse.<br>
 <br>
 6:22 <B>{When they shall separate you}</B> <b><i>(\hotan aphoris&#333;sin hum&#257;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active subjunctive, from \aphoriz&#333;\, common verb for<br>
 marking off a boundary. So either in good sense or bad sense as<br>
 here. The reference is to excommunication from the congregation<br>
 as well as from social intercourse. <B>{Cast out your name as evil}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\exbal&#333;sin to onoma hum&#333;n h&#333;s pon&#275;ron\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 subjunctive of \ekball&#333;\, common verb. The verb is used in<br>
 Aristophanes, Sophocles, and Plato of hissing an actor off the<br>
 stage. The name of Christian or disciple or Nazarene came to be a<br>
 byword of contempt as shown in the Acts. It was even unlawful in<br>
 the Neronian persecution when Christianity was not a _religio<br>
 licita_. <B>{For the Son of man's sake}</B> <b><i>(\heneka tou huiou tou<br>
 anthr&#333;pou\)</i></b>. Jesus foretold what will befall those who are loyal<br>
 to him. The Acts of the Apostles is a commentary on this<br>
 prophecy. This is Christ's common designation of himself, never<br>
 of others save by Stephen <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 7:56)</i></b> and in the Apocalypse <b><i>(<!-#-->Re<br>
 1:13; 14:14)</i></b>. But both Son of God and Son of man apply to him<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:50,52; Mt 26:63f.)</i></b>. Christ was a real man though the Son<br>
 of God. He is also the representative man and has authority over<br>
 all men.<br>
 <br>
 6:23 <B>{Leap for joy}</B> <b><i>(\skirt&#275;sate\)</i></b>. Old verb and in LXX, but only<br>
 in Luke in the N.T. <b><i>(here and <!-#-->1:41,44)</i></b>. It answers to Matthew's<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:12)</i></b> "be exceeding glad." <B>{Did}</B> <b><i>(\epoioun\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active, the habit of "their fathers" <b><i>(peculiar to both here)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 5:12 has "persecuted." Thus they will receive a prophet's reward<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 1:41)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:24 <B>{But woe unto you that are rich}</B> <b><i>(\Pl&#275;n ouai humin tois<br>
 plousiois\)</i></b>. Sharp contrast <b><i>(\pl&#275;n\)</i></b>. As a matter of fact the<br>
 rich Pharisees and Sadducees were the chief opposers of Christ as<br>
 of the early disciples later <b><i>(<!-#-->Jas 5:1-6)</i></b>. <B>{Ye have received}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\apechete\)</i></b>. Receipt in full \apech&#333;\ means as the papyri show.<br>
 <B>{Consolation}</B> <b><i>(\parakl&#275;sin\)</i></b>. From \parakale&#333;\, to call to one's<br>
 side, to encourage, to help, to cheer.<br>
 <br>
 6:25 <B>{Now}</B> <b><i>(\nun\)</i></b>. Here twice as in verse <!-#-->21 in contrast with<br>
 future punishment. The joys and sorrows in these two verses are<br>
 turned round, measure for measure reversed. The Rich Man and<br>
 Lazarus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 16:19-31)</i></b> illustrate these contrasts in the present<br>
 and the future.<br>
 <br>
 6:26 <B>{In the same manner did their fathers}</B> <b><i>(\ta auta epoioun hoi<br>
 pateres aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Literally, their fathers did the same things to<br>
 the false prophets. That is they spoke well <b><i>(\kal&#333;s\)</i></b>, finely of<br>
 false prophets. Praise is sweet to the preacher but all sorts of<br>
 preachers get it. <B>{Of you}</B> <b><i>(\humas\)</i></b>. Accusative case after words<br>
 of speaking according to regular Greek idiom, to speak one fair,<br>
 to speak well of one.<br>
 <br>
 6:27 <B>{But I say unto you that hear}</B> <b><i>(\Alla humin leg&#333; tois<br>
 akouousin\)</i></b>. There is a contrast in this use of \alla\ like that<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 5:44. This is the only one of the many examples given by<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 5 of the sharp antithesis between what the rabbis taught and<br>
 what Jesus said. Perhaps that contrast is referred to by Luke. If<br>
 necessary, \alla\ could be coordinating or paratactic conjunction<br>
 as in <!-#-->2Co 7:11 rather than adversative as apparently here. See<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 5:43f. Love of enemies is in the O.T., but Jesus ennobles<br>
 the word, \agapa&#333;\, and uses it of love for one's enemies.<br>
 <br>
 6:28 <B>{That despitefully use you}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n ep&#275;reazont&#333;n hum&#257;s\)</i></b>. This<br>
 old verb occurs here only in the N.T. and in <!-#-->1Pe 3:16, not<br>
 being genuine in <!-#-->Mt 5:44.<br>
 <br>
 6:29 <B>{On the cheek}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;n siagona\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 5:39 has "right."<br>
 Old word meaning jaw or jawbone, but in the N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 5:39, which see for discussion. It seems an act of violence<br>
 rather than contempt. Sticklers for extreme literalism find<br>
 trouble with the conduct of Jesus in <!-#-->Joh 18:22f. where Jesus,<br>
 on receiving a slap in the face, protested against it. <B>{Thy<br>
 cloke}</B> <b><i>(\to himation\)</i></b>, <B>{thy coat}</B> <b><i>(\ton chit&#333;na\)</i></b>. Here the<br>
 upper and more valuable garment <b><i>(\himation\)</i></b> is first taken, the<br>
 under and less valuable \chit&#333;n\ last. In <!-#-->Mt 5:40 the process<br>
 <b><i>(apparently a legal one)</i></b> is reversed. <B>{Withhold not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;<br>
 k&#333;lus&#275;is\)</i></b>. Aorist subjunctive in prohibition against committing<br>
 an act. Do not hinder him in his robbing. It is usually useless<br>
 anyhow with modern armed bandits.<br>
 <br>
 6:30 <B>{Ask them not again}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; apaitei\)</i></b>. Here the present active<br>
 imperative in a prohibition, do not have the habit of asking<br>
 back. This common verb only here in the N.T., for \aitousin\ is<br>
 the correct text in <!-#-->Lu 12:20. The literary flavour of Luke's<br>
 _Koin&#275;_ style is seen in his frequent use of words common in the<br>
 literary Greek, but appearing nowhere else in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 6:31 <B>{As ye would}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s thelete\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Mt 7:12 the Golden<br>
 Rule begins: \Panta hosa ean thel&#275;te\. Luke has "likewise"<br>
 <b><i>(\homoi&#333;s\)</i></b> where Matthew has \hout&#333;s\. See on Matthew for<br>
 discussion of the saying.<br>
 <br>
 6:32 <B>{What thank have ye?}</B> <b><i>(\poia h&#8211;min charis estin;\)</i></b>. What<br>
 grace or gratitude is there to you? <!-#-->Mt 5:46 has \misthon\<br>
 <b><i>(reward)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:33 <B>{Do good}</B> <b><i>(\agathopoi&#275;te\)</i></b>. Third-class condition, \ean\ and<br>
 present subjunctive. This verb not in old Greek, but in LXX.<br>
 <B>{Even sinners}</B> <b><i>(\kai hoi hamart&#333;loi\)</i></b>. Even the sinners, the<br>
 article distinguishing the class. <!-#-->Mt 5:46 has "even the<br>
 publicans" and <!-#-->5:47 "even the Gentiles." That completes the<br>
 list of the outcasts for "sinners" includes "harlots" and all the<br>
 rest.<br>
 <br>
 6:34 <B>{If ye lend}</B> <b><i>(\ean danis&#275;te\)</i></b>. Third-class condition, first<br>
 aorist active subjunctive from \daniz&#333;\ <b><i>(old form \daneiz&#333;\)</i></b> to<br>
 lend for interest in a business transaction <b><i>(here in active to<br>
 lend and <!-#-->Mt 5:42 middle to borrow and nowhere else in N.T.)</i></b>,<br>
 whereas \kichr&#275;mi\ <b><i>(only <!-#-->Lu 11:5 in N.T.)</i></b> means to loan as a<br>
 friendly act. <B>{To receive again as much}</B> <b><i>(\hina apolab&#333;sin ta<br>
 isa\)</i></b>. Second aorist active subjunctive of \apolamban&#333;\, old<br>
 verb, to get back in full like \apech&#333;\ in <!-#-->6:24. Literally<br>
 here, "that they may get back the equal" <b><i>(principal and interest,<br>
 apparently)</i></b>. It could mean "equivalent services." No parallel in<br>
 Matthew.<br>
 <br>
 6:35 <B>{But}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;n\)</i></b>. Plain adversative like \pl&#275;n\ in verse <!-#-->24.<br>
 Never despairing <b><i>(\m&#275;den apelpizontes\)</i></b>. \M&#275;den\ is read by A B L<br>
 Bohairic and is the reading of Westcott and Hort. The reading<br>
 \m&#275;dena\ is translated "despairing of no man." The Authorized<br>
 Version has it "hoping for nothing again," a meaning for<br>
 \apelpiz&#333;\ with no parallel elsewhere. Field <b><i>(_Otium Nor._ iii.<br>
 40)</i></b> insists that all the same the context demands this meaning<br>
 because of \apelpizein\ in verse <!-#-->34, but the correct reading<br>
 there is \elpizein\, not \apelpizein\. Here Field's argument<br>
 falls to the ground. The word occurs in Polybius, Diodorus, LXX<br>
 with the sense of despairing and that is the meaning here. D and<br>
 Old Latin documents have _nihil desperantes_, but the Vulgate has<br>
 _nihil inde sperantes_ <b><i>(hoping for nothing thence)</i></b> and this false<br>
 rendering has wrought great havoc in Europe. "On the strength of<br>
 it Popes and councils have repeatedly condemned the taking of any<br>
 interest whatever for loans. As loans could not be had without<br>
 interest, and Christians were forbidden to take it, money lending<br>
 passed into the hands of the Jews, and added greatly to the<br>
 unnatural detestation in which Jews were held" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. By<br>
 "never despairing" or "giving up nothing in despair" Jesus means<br>
 that we are not to despair about getting the money back. We are<br>
 to help the apparently hopeless cases. Medical writers use the<br>
 word for desperate or hopeless cases. <B>{Sons of the Most High}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\huoi Hupsistou\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->1:32 Jesus is called "Son of the<br>
 Highest" and here all real children or sons of God <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 20:36)</i></b><br>
 are so termed. See also <!-#-->1:35,76 for the use of "the Highest" of<br>
 God. He means the same thing that we see in <!-#-->Mt 5:45,48 by "your<br>
 Father." <B>{Toward the unthankful and evil}</B> <b><i>(\epi tous acharistous<br>
 kai pon&#275;rous\)</i></b>. God the Father is kind towards the unkind and<br>
 wicked. Note the one article with both adjectives.<br>
 <br>
 6:36 <B>{Even as your Father}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s ho pat&#275;r hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Mt<br>
 5:48 we have \h&#333;s ho pat&#275;r hum&#333;n\. In both the perfection of the<br>
 Father is placed as the goal before his children. In neither case<br>
 is it said that they have reached it.<br>
 <br>
 6:37 <B>{And judge not}</B> <b><i>(\kai m&#275; krinete\)</i></b>. \M&#275;\ and the present<br>
 active imperative, forbidding the habit of criticism. The common<br>
 verb \krin&#333;\, to separate, we have in our English words critic,<br>
 criticism, criticize, discriminate. Jesus does not mean that we<br>
 are not to form opinions, but not to form them rashly, unfairly,<br>
 like our prejudice. <B>{Ye shall not be judged}</B> <b><i>(\ou m&#275; krith&#275;te\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive subjunctive with double negative ou \m&#275;\,<br>
 strong negative. <B>{Condemn not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; katadikazete\)</i></b>. To give<br>
 judgment <b><i>(\dik&#275;, dixaz&#333;\)</i></b> against <b><i>(\kata\)</i></b> one. \M&#275;\ and present<br>
 imperative. Either cease doing or do not have the habit of doing<br>
 it. Old verb. <B>{Ye shall not be condemned}</B> <b><i>(\ou m&#275;<br>
 katadikasth&#275;te\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative again with the<br>
 double negative. Censoriousness is a bad habit. <B>{Release}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\apoluete\)</i></b>. Positive command the opposite of the censoriousness<br>
 condemned.<br>
 <br>
 6:38 <B>{Pressed down}</B> <b><i>(\pepiesmenon\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle<br>
 from \piez&#333;\, old verb, but here alone in the N.T., though the<br>
 Doric form \piaz&#333;\, to seize, occurs several times <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 7:30,32,44)</i></b>. <B>{Shaken together}</B> <b><i>(\sesaleumenon\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle again from common verb \saleu&#333;\. <B>{Running over}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\huperekchunnomenon\)</i></b>. Present middle participle of this double<br>
 compound verb not found elsewhere save in A Q in <!-#-->Joe 2:24.<br>
 \Chun&#333;\ is a late form of \che&#333;\. There is asyndeton here, no<br>
 conjunction connecting these participles. The present here is in<br>
 contrast to the two preceding perfects. The participles form an<br>
 epexegesis or explanation of the "good measure" <b><i>(\metron kalon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Into your bosom <b><i>(\eis ton kolpon hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. The fold of the wide<br>
 upper garment bound by the girdle made a pocket in common use<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 4:6; Pr 6:27; Ps 79:12; Isa 65:6f.; Jer 32:18)</i></b>. So <!-#-->Isa<br>
 65:7: <B>{I will measure their former work unto their bosom. Shall<br>
 be measured to you again}</B> <b><i>(\antimetr&#275;th&#275;setai\)</i></b>. Future passive<br>
 indicative of the verb here only in the N.T. save late MSS. in<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 7:2. Even here some MSS. have \metr&#275;th&#275;setai\. The \anti\<br>
 has the common meaning of in turn or back, measured back to you<br>
 in requital.<br>
 <br>
 6:39 <B>{Also a parable}</B> <b><i>(\kai parabol&#275;n\)</i></b>. Plummer thinks that the<br>
 second half of the sermon begins here as indicated by Luke's<br>
 insertion of "And he spake <b><i>(\eipen de\)</i></b> at this point. Luke has<br>
 the word parable some fifteen times both for crisp proverbs and<br>
 for the longer narrative comparisons. This is the only use of the<br>
 term parable concerning the metaphors in the Sermon on the Mount.<br>
 But in both Matthew and Luke's report of the discourse there are<br>
 some sixteen possible applications of the word. Two come right<br>
 together: The blind leading the blind, the mote and the beam.<br>
 Matthew gives the parabolic proverb of the blind leading the<br>
 blind later <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 15:14)</i></b>. Jesus repeated these sayings on various<br>
 occasions as every teacher does his characteristic ideas. So Luke<br>
 <!-#-->6:40; Mt 10:24, <!-#-->Lu 6:45; Mt 12:34f. <B>{Can}</B> <b><i>(\M&#275;ti dunatai\)</i></b>.<br>
 The use of \m&#275;ti\ in the question shows that a negative answer is<br>
 expected. <B>{Guide}</B> <b><i>(\hod&#275;gein\)</i></b>. Common verb from \hod&#275;gos\<br>
 <b><i>(guide)</i></b> and this from \hodos\ <b><i>(way)</i></b> and \h&#275;geomai\, to lead or<br>
 guide. <B>{Shall they not both fall?}</B> <b><i>(\ouchi amphoteroi<br>
 empesountai;\)</i></b>. \Ouchi\, a sharpened negative from \ouk\, in a<br>
 question expecting the answer Yes. Future middle indicative of<br>
 the common verb \empipt&#333;\. <B>{Into a pit}</B> <b><i>(\eis bothunon\)</i></b>. Late<br>
 word for older \bothros\.<br>
 <br>
 6:40 <B>{The disciple is not above his master}</B> <b><i>(\ouk estin math&#275;t&#275;s<br>
 huper ton didaskalon\)</i></b>. Literally, a learner <b><i>(or pupil)</i></b> is not<br>
 above the teacher. Precisely so in <!-#-->Mt 10:24 where "slave" is<br>
 added with "lord." But here Luke adds: "But everyone when he is<br>
 perfected shall be as his master" <b><i>(\kat&#275;rtismenos de p&#257;s estai<br>
 h&#333;s ho didaskalos autou\)</i></b>. The state of completion, perfect<br>
 passive participle, is noted in \kat&#275;rtismenos\. The word is<br>
 common for mending broken things or nets <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 4:21)</i></b> or men <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga<br>
 6:1)</i></b>. So it is a long process to get the pupil patched up to the<br>
 plane of his teacher.<br>
 <br>
 6:41 <B>{Mote}</B> <b><i>(\karphos\)</i></b> and <B>{beam}</B> <b><i>(\dokon\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 7:3-5<br>
 for discussion of these words in this parabolic proverb kin to<br>
 several of ours today.<br>
 <br>
 6:42 <B>{Canst thou say}</B> <b><i>(\dunasai legein\)</i></b>. Here <!-#-->Mt 7:4 has <B>{wilt<br>
 thou say}</B> <b><i>(\ereis\)</i></b>. <B>{Beholdest not}</B> <b><i>(\ou blep&#333;n\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 7:4 has<br>
 "lo" <b><i>(\idou\)</i></b>. <B>{Thou hypocrite}</B> <b><i>(\hupokrita\)</i></b>. Contrast to the<br>
 studied politeness of "brother" <b><i>(\adelphe\)</i></b> above. Powerful<br>
 picture of blind self-complacence and incompetence, the keyword<br>
 to argument here.<br>
 <br>
 6:44 <B>{Is known}</B> <b><i>(\gin&#333;sketai\)</i></b>. The fruit of each tree reveals<br>
 its actual character. It is the final test. This sentence is not<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 7:17-20, but the same idea is in the repeated saying <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 7:16,20)</i></b>: "By their fruits ye shall know them," where the verb<br>
 <B>{epign&#333;sesthe}</B> means full knowledge. The question in <!-#-->Mt 7:16 is<br>
 put here in positive declarative form. The verb is in the plural<br>
 for "men" or "people," \sullegousin\. See on &#175;Mt 7:16. <B>{Bramble<br>
 bush}</B> <b><i>(\batou\)</i></b>. Old word, quoted from the LXX in <!-#-->Mr 12:26; Lu<br>
 20:37 <b><i>(from <!-#-->Ex 3:6)</i></b> about the burning bush that Moses saw, and<br>
 by Stephen <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 7:30,35)</i></b> referring to the same incident. Nowhere<br>
 else in the N.T. "Galen has a chapter on its medicinal uses, and<br>
 the medical writings abound in prescriptions of which it is an<br>
 ingredient" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. <B>{Gather}</B> <b><i>(\trug&#333;sin\)</i></b>. A verb common in<br>
 Greek writers for gathering ripe fruit. In the N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->Re 14:18f. <B>{Grapes}</B> <b><i>(\staphul&#275;n\)</i></b>. Cluster of grapes.<br>
 <br>
 6:45 <B>{Bringeth forth}</B> <b><i>(\propherei\)</i></b>. In a similar saying repeated<br>
 later. <!-#-->Mt 12:34f. has the verb \ekballei\ <b><i>(throws out, casts<br>
 out)</i></b>, a bolder figure. "When men are natural, heart and mouth act<br>
 in concert. But otherwise the mouth sometimes professes what the<br>
 heart does not feel" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:46 <B>{And do not}</B> <b><i>(\kai ou poieite\)</i></b>. This is the point about<br>
 every sermon that counts. The two parables that follow illustrate<br>
 this point.<br>
 <br>
 6:47 <B>{Hears and does}</B> <b><i>(\akou&#333;n kai poi&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present active<br>
 participles. So in <!-#-->Mt 7:24. <b><i>(Present indicative.)</i></b> <B>{I will show<br>
 you}</B> <b><i>(\hupodeix&#333; humin\)</i></b>. Only in Luke, not Matthew.<br>
 <br>
 6:48 <B>{Digged and went deep}</B> <b><i>(\eskapsen kai ebathunen\)</i></b>. Two first<br>
 aorist indicatives. Not a _hendiadys_ for dug deep. \Skapt&#333;\, to<br>
 dig, is as old as Homer, as is \bathun&#333;\, to make deep. <B>{And laid<br>
 a foundation}</B> <b><i>(\kai eth&#275;ken themelion\)</i></b>. That is the whole point.<br>
 This wise builder struck the rock before he laid the foundation.<br>
 <B>{When a flood arose}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;mmur&#275;s genomen&#275;s\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute.<br>
 Late word for flood, \pl&#275;mmura\, only here in the N.T., though in<br>
 <!-#-->Job 40:18. <B>{Brake against}</B> <b><i>(\proser&#275;xen\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative from \prosr&#275;gnumi\ and in late writers \prosr&#275;ss&#333;\, to<br>
 break against. Only here in the N.T. <!-#-->Mt 7:25 has \prosepesan\,<br>
 from \prospipt&#333;\, to fall against. <B>{Could not shake it}</B> <b><i>(\ouk<br>
 ischusen saleusai aut&#275;n\)</i></b>. Did not have strength enough to shake<br>
 it. <B>{Because it had been well builded}</B> <b><i>(\dia to kal&#333;s<br>
 oikodom&#275;sthai aut&#275;n\)</i></b>. Perfect passive articular infinitive after<br>
 \dia\ and with accusative of general reference.<br>
 <br>
 6:49 <B>{He that heareth and doeth not}</B> <b><i>(\ho de akousas kai m&#275;<br>
 poi&#275;sas\)</i></b>. Aorist active participle with article. Particular case<br>
 singled out <b><i>(punctiliar, aorist)</i></b>. <B>{Like a man}</B> <b><i>(\homoios estin<br>
 anthr&#333;p&#333;i\)</i></b>. Associative instrumental case after \homoios\ as in<br>
 verse <!-#-->47. <B>{Upon the earth}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;n g&#275;n\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 7:26 has "upon<br>
 the sand" <b><i>(\epi t&#275;n ammon\)</i></b>, more precise and worse than mere<br>
 earth. But not on the rock. <B>{Without a foundation}</B> <b><i>(\ch&#333;ris<br>
 themeliou\)</i></b>. The foundation on the rock after deep digging as in<br>
 verse <!-#-->48. <B>{It fell in}</B> <b><i>(\sunepesen\)</i></b>. Second aorist active of<br>
 \sunpipt&#333;\, to fall together, to collapse. An old verb from Homer<br>
 on, but only here in the N.T. <B>{The ruin}</B> <b><i>(\to r&#275;gma\)</i></b>. The crash<br>
 like a giant oak in the forest resounded far and wide. An old<br>
 word for a rent or fracture as in medicine for laceration of a<br>
 wound. Only here in the N.T.<br>
