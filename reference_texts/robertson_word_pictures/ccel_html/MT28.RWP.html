<p>28:1 <B>{Now late on the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the<br>
 first day of the week}</B> <b><i>(\opse de sabbat&#333;n, t&#275;i epiph&#333;skous&#275;i eis<br>
 mian sabbat&#333;n\)</i></b>. This careful chronological statement according<br>
 to Jewish days clearly means that before the sabbath was over,<br>
 that is before six P.M., this visit by the women was made "to see<br>
 the sepulchre" <b><i>(\theor&#275;sai ton taphon\)</i></b>. They had seen the place<br>
 of burial on Friday afternoon <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 15:47; Mt 27:61; Lu 23:55)</i></b>.<br>
 They had rested on the sabbath after preparing spices and<br>
 ointments for the body of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:56)</i></b>, a sabbath of<br>
 unutterable sorrow and woe. They will buy other spices after<br>
 sundown when the new day has dawned and the sabbath is over <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 16:1)</i></b>. Both Matthew here and Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:54)</i></b> use dawn<br>
 <b><i>(\epiph&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b> for the dawning of the twenty-four hour-day at<br>
 sunset, not of the dawning of the twelve-hour day at sunrise. The<br>
 Aramaic used the verb for dawn in both senses. The so-called<br>
 Gospel of Peter has \epiph&#333;sk&#333;\ in the same sense as Matthew and<br>
 Luke as does a late papyrus. Apparently the Jewish sense of<br>
 "dawn" is here expressed by this Greek verb. Allen thinks that<br>
 Matthew misunderstands Mark at this point, but clearly Mark is<br>
 speaking of sunrise and Matthew of sunset. Why allow only one<br>
 visit for the anxious women?<br>
 <br>
 28:2 <B>{There was a great earthquake}</B> <b><i>(\seismos egeneto megas\)</i></b>.<br>
 Clearly not the earthquake of <!-#-->27:51. The precise time of this<br>
 earthquake is not given. It was before sunrise on the first day<br>
 of the week when the women made the next visit. Matthew alone<br>
 relates the coming of the angel of the Lord who rolled away the<br>
 stone and was sitting upon it <b><i>(\apekulise ton lithon kai ekath&#275;to<br>
 epan&#333; autou\)</i></b>. If one is querulous about these supernatural<br>
 phenomena, he should reflect that the Resurrection of Jesus is<br>
 one of the great supernatural events of all time. Cornelius &#8230;<br>
 Lapide dares to say: "The earth, which trembled with sorrow at<br>
 the Death of Christ as it were leaped for joy at His<br>
 Resurrection." The Angel of the Lord announced the Incarnation of<br>
 the Son of God and also His Resurrection from the grave. There<br>
 are apparent inconsistencies in the various narratives of the<br>
 Resurrection and the appearances of the Risen Christ. We do not<br>
 know enough of the details to be able to reconcile them. But the<br>
 very variations strengthen the independent witness to the<br>
 essential fact that Jesus rose from the grave. Let each writer<br>
 give his own account in his own way. The stone was rolled away<br>
 not to let the Lord out, but to let the women in to prove the<br>
 fact of the empty tomb <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 28:3 <B>{Appearance}</B> <b><i>(\eidea\)</i></b>. Here only in the N.T. Compare<br>
 \morph&#275;\ and \sch&#275;ma\.<br>
 <br>
 28:4 <B>{The watchers did quake}</B> <b><i>(\eseisth&#275;san hoi t&#275;rountes\)</i></b>. And<br>
 no wonder that they became as dead men and fled before the women<br>
 came.<br>
 <br>
 28:5 <B>{Unto the women}</B> <b><i>(\tais gunaixin\)</i></b>. According to John, Mary<br>
 Magdalene had left to go and tell Peter and John of the supposed<br>
 grave robbery <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 20:1f.)</i></b>. But the other women remained and<br>
 had the interview with the angel <b><i>(or men, Luke)</i></b> about the empty<br>
 tomb and the Risen Christ. <B>{Jesus the Crucified}</B> <b><i>(\I&#275;soun ton<br>
 estaur&#333;menon\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle, state of completion.<br>
 This he will always be. So Paul will preach as essential to his<br>
 gospel "and this one crucified" <b><i>(\kai touton estaur&#333;menon\, <!-#-->1Co<br>
 2:2)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 28:6 <B>{Risen from the dead}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;gerth&#275; apo t&#333;n nekr&#333;n\)</i></b>. <B>{Jesus the<br>
 Risen}</B>. This is the heart of the testimony of the angel to the<br>
 women. It is what Paul wishes Timothy never to forget <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti<br>
 2:8)</i></b>, "Jesus Christ risen from the dead" <b><i>(\I&#275;soun Christon<br>
 eg&#275;germenon ek nekr&#333;n\)</i></b>. They were afraid and dazzled by the<br>
 glory of the scene, but the angel said, "Come, see the place<br>
 where the Lord lay" <b><i>(\deute idete ton topon hopou ekeito ho<br>
 Kurios\)</i></b>. Some MSS. do not have \ho Kurios\, but he is the<br>
 subject of \ekeito\. His body was not there. It will not do to<br>
 say that Jesus arose in spirit and appeared alive though his body<br>
 remained in the tomb. The empty tomb is the first great fact<br>
 confronting the women and later the men. Various theories were<br>
 offered then as now. But none of them satisfy the evidence and<br>
 explain the survival of faith and hope in the disciples that do<br>
 not rest upon the fact of the Risen Christ whose body was no<br>
 longer in the tomb.<br>
 <br>
 28:7 <B>{He goeth before you into Galilee}</B> <b><i>(\proagei humas eis t&#275;n<br>
 Galilaian\)</i></b>. Jesus did appear to the disciples in Galilee on two<br>
 notable occasions <b><i>(by the beloved lake, <!-#-->Joh 21, and on the<br>
 mountain, <!-#-->Mt 28:16-20)</i></b>. Probably before the women were<br>
 permitted to tell this story in full to the disciples who scouted<br>
 as idle talk <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 24:11)</i></b> their first accounts, Jesus appeared<br>
 to various disciples in Jerusalem on this first great Sunday.<br>
 Jesus did not say that he would not see any of them in Jerusalem.<br>
 He merely made a definite appointment in Galilee which he kept.<br>
 <br>
 28:8 <B>{With fear and great joy}</B> <b><i>(\meta phobou kai charas<br>
 megal&#275;s\)</i></b>. A touch of life was this as the excited women ran<br>
 quickly <b><i>(\tachu edramon\)</i></b> as they had been told "to bring his<br>
 disciples word" <b><i>(\apaggeilai tois math&#275;tais autou\)</i></b>. They had the<br>
 greatest piece of news that it was possible to have. Mark calls<br>
 it fear and ecstasy. Anything seemed possible now. Mark even says<br>
 that at first they told no one anything for they were afraid <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 16:9)</i></b>, the tragic close of the text of Mark in Aleph and B, our<br>
 two oldest manuscripts. But these mingled emotions of ecstasy and<br>
 dread need cause no surprise when all things are considered.<br>
 <br>
 28:9 <B>{Jesus met them}</B> <b><i>(\I&#275;sous hup&#275;nt&#275;sen autais\)</i></b>. Came suddenly<br>
 face to face <b><i>(\anta&#333;, hupo\)</i></b> with them as they brooded over the<br>
 message of the angel and the fact of the empty tomb <b><i>(associative<br>
 instrumental, \autais\)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->8:34; 24:1-6. Probably the lost<br>
 portion of Mark's Gospel contained the story of this meeting with<br>
 Jesus which changed their fears into joy and peace. His greeting<br>
 was the ordinary "Hail" <b><i>(\chairete\)</i></b>. They fell at his feet and<br>
 held them in reverence while they worshipped him. Jesus allowed<br>
 this act of worship though he forbade eager handling of his body<br>
 by Mary Magdalene <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 20:17)</i></b>. It was a great moment of faith<br>
 and cheer.<br>
 <br>
 28:10 <B>{Fear not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; phobeisthe\)</i></b>. They were still afraid for<br>
 joy and embarrassment. Jesus calms their excitement by the<br>
 repetition of the charge from the angel for the disciples to meet<br>
 him in Galilee. There is no special mention of Peter <b><i>("and<br>
 Peter")</i></b> as in <!-#-->Mr 16:7, but we may be sure that the special<br>
 message to Peter was delivered.<br>
 <br>
 28:11 <B>{Told unto the chief priests}</B> <b><i>(\ap&#275;ggeilan tois<br>
 archiereusin\)</i></b>. These Roman soldiers had been placed at the<br>
 disposal of the Sanhedrin. They were probably afraid also to<br>
 report to Pilate and tell him what had happened. They apparently<br>
 told a truthful account as far as they understood it. But were<br>
 the Sanhedrin convinced of the resurrection of Jesus?<br>
 <br>
 28:12 <B>{They gave large money}</B> <b><i>(\arguria hikana ed&#333;kan\)</i></b>. The use<br>
 of the plural for pieces of silver <b><i>(\arguria\)</i></b> is common. The<br>
 papyri have many instances of \hikana\ for considerable <b><i>(from<br>
 \hikan&#333;\, to reach to, attain to)</i></b>. These pious Sanhedrists knew<br>
 full well the power of bribes. They make a contract with the<br>
 Roman soldiers to tell a lie about the resurrection of Jesus as<br>
 they paid Judas money to betray him. They show not the slightest<br>
 tendency to be convinced by the facts though one had risen from<br>
 the dead.<br>
 <br>
 28:13 <B>{Stole him away while we slept}</B> <b><i>(\eklepsan auton h&#275;m&#333;n<br>
 koim&#333;men&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute. An Irish bull on the face of it.<br>
 If they were asleep they would not know anything about it.<br>
 <br>
 28:14 <B>{We will persuade him, and rid you of care}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meis<br>
 peisomen kai humas amerimnous poi&#275;somen\)</i></b>. They would try money<br>
 also on Pilate and assume all responsibility. Hence the soldiers<br>
 have no anxiety <b><i>(\amerimnous\, alpha privative and \merimna&#333;\, to<br>
 be anxious)</i></b>. They lived up to their bargain and this lie lives on<br>
 through the ages. Justin <b><i>(_Dial_. 108)</i></b> accuses the Jews of<br>
 spreading the charge. Bengel: _Quam laboriosum bellum mendacii<br>
 contra veritatem_. <B>{It was spread about}</B> <b><i>(\dieph&#275;misth&#275;\)</i></b><br>
 diligently by the Jews to excuse their disbelief in the<br>
 Messiahship of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 28:17 <B>{But some doubted}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de edistasan\)</i></b>. From \dis\ <b><i>(in<br>
 two, divided in mind)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Mt 14:31. The reference is not to<br>
 the eleven who were all now convinced after some doubt, but to<br>
 the others present. Paul states that over five hundred were<br>
 present, most of whom were still alive when he wrote <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 15:6)</i></b>. It is natural that some should hesitate to believe so<br>
 great a thing at the first appearance of Jesus to them. Their<br>
 very doubt makes it easier for us to believe. This was the<br>
 mountain where Jesus had promised to meet them. This fact<br>
 explains the large number present. Time and place were arranged<br>
 beforehand. It was the climax of the various appearances and in<br>
 Galilee where were so many believers. They worshipped<br>
 <b><i>(\prosekun&#275;san\)</i></b> Jesus as the women had done <b><i>(<!-#-->28:9)</i></b>. He is now<br>
 their Risen Lord and Saviour.<br>
 <br>
 28:18 <B>{All authority}</B> <b><i>(\p&#257;sa exousia\)</i></b>. Jesus came close to them<br>
 <b><i>(\proselth&#333;n\)</i></b> and made this astounding claim. He spoke as one<br>
 already in heaven with a world-wide outlook and with the<br>
 resources of heaven at his command. His authority or power in his<br>
 earthly life had been great <b><i>(<!-#-->7:29; 11:27; 21:23f.)</i></b>. Now it is<br>
 boundless and includes earth and heaven. <B>{Hath been given}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\edoth&#275;\)</i></b> is a timeless aorist <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp.<br>
 836f.)</i></b>. It is the sublimist of all spectacles to see the Risen<br>
 Christ without money or army or state charging this band of five<br>
 hundred men and women with world conquest and bringing them to<br>
 believe it possible and to undertake it with serious passion and<br>
 power. Pentecost is still to come, but dynamic faith rules on<br>
 this mountain in Galilee.<br>
 <br>
 28:19 <B>{All the nations}</B> <b><i>(\panta ta ethn&#275;\)</i></b>. Not just the Jews<br>
 scattered among the Gentiles, but the Gentiles themselves in<br>
 every land. And not by making Jews of them, though this point is<br>
 not made plain here. It will take time for the disciples to grow<br>
 into this _Magna Charta_ of the missionary propaganda. But here<br>
 is the world program of the Risen Christ and it should not be<br>
 forgotten by those who seek to foreshorten it all by saying that<br>
 Jesus expected his second coming to be very soon, even within the<br>
 lifetime of those who heard. He did promise to come, but he has<br>
 never named the date. Meanwhile we are to be ready for his coming<br>
 at any time and to look for it joyfully. But we are to leave that<br>
 to the Father and push on the campaign for world conquest. This<br>
 program includes making disciples or learners <b><i>(\math&#275;teusate\)</i></b><br>
 such as they were themselves. That means evangelism in the<br>
 fullest sense and not merely revival meetings. Baptism in <b><i>(\eis\,<br>
 not _into_)</i></b> the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,<br>
 in the name of the Trinity. Objection is raised to this language<br>
 in the mouth of Jesus as too theological and as not a genuine<br>
 part of the Gospel of Matthew for the same reason. See <!-#-->Mt<br>
 11:27, where Jesus speaks of the Father and the Son as here. But<br>
 it is all to no purpose. There is a chapter devoted to this<br>
 subject in my _The Christ of the Logia_ in which the genuineness<br>
 of these words is proven. The name of Jesus is the essential part<br>
 of it as is shown in the Acts. Trine immersion is not taught as<br>
 the Greek Church holds and practices, baptism in the name of the<br>
 Father, then of the Son, then of the Holy Spirit. The use of name<br>
 <b><i>(\onoma\)</i></b> here is a common one in the Septuagint and the papyri<br>
 for power or authority. For the use of \eis\ with \onoma\ in the<br>
 sense here employed, not meaning _into_, see <!-#-->Mt 10:41f. <b><i>(cf.<br>
 also <!-#-->12:41)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 28:20 <B>{Teaching them}</B> <b><i>(\didaskontes autous\)</i></b>. Christians have<br>
 been slow to realize the full value of what we now call religious<br>
 education. The work of teaching belongs to the home, to the<br>
 church <b><i>(sermon, Sunday school, young people's work,<br>
 prayer-meeting, study classes, mission classes)</i></b>, to the school<br>
 <b><i>(not mixing of church and state, but moral instruction if not the<br>
 reading of the Bible)</i></b>, good books which should be in every home,<br>
 reading of the Bible itself. Some react too far and actually put<br>
 education in the place of conversion or regeneration. That is to<br>
 miss the mark. But teaching is part, a weighty part, of the work<br>
 of Christians.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{I am with you}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; meta hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. This is the amazing and<br>
 blessed promise. He is to be with the disciples when he is gone,<br>
 with all the disciples, with all knowledge, with all power, with<br>
 them all the days <b><i>(all sorts of days, weakness, sorrows, joy,<br>
 power)</i></b>, till the consummation of the age <b><i>(\he&#333;s t&#275;s sunteleias<br>
 tou ai&#333;nos\)</i></b>. That goal is in the future and unknown to the<br>
 disciples. This blessed hope is not designed as a sedative to an<br>
 inactive mind and complacent conscience, but an incentive to the<br>
 fullest endeavor to press on to the farthest limits of the world<br>
 that all the nations may know Christ and the power of his Risen<br>
 Life. So Matthew's Gospel closes in a blaze of glory. Christ is<br>
 conqueror in prospect and in fact. Christian history from that<br>
 eventful experience on the Mountain in Galilee has been the<br>
 fulfilment of that promise in as far as we allow God's power to<br>
 work in us for the winning of the world to Christ, the Risen, all<br>
 powerful Redeemer, who is with his people all the time. Jesus<br>
 employs the prophetic present here <b><i>(\eimi\, I am)</i></b>. He is with us<br>
 all the days till he comes in glory.<br>
