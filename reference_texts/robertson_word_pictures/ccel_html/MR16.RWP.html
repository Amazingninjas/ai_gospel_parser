<p>16:1 <B>{When the sabbath was past}</B> <b><i>(\diagenomenou tou sabbatou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute, the sabbath having come in between, and now<br>
 over. For this sense of the verb <b><i>(common from Demosthenes on)</i></b> see<br>
 <!-#-->Ac 25:13; 27:9. It was therefore after sunset. <B>{Bought spices}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;gorasan ar&#333;mata\)</i></b>. As Nicodemus did on the day of the burial<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:40)</i></b>. Gould denies that the Jews were familiar with the<br>
 embalming process of Egypt, but at any rate it was to be a<br>
 reverential anointing <b><i>(\hina aleips&#333;sin\)</i></b> of the body of Jesus<br>
 with spices. They could buy them after sundown. Salome in the<br>
 group again as in <!-#-->Mr 15:40. See on &#175;Mt 28:1 for discussion of<br>
 "late on the sabbath day" and the visit of the women to the tomb<br>
 before sundown. They had returned from the tomb after the<br>
 watching late Friday afternoon and had prepared spices <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 23:56)</i></b>. Now they secured a fresh supply.<br>
 <br>
 16:2 <B>{When the sun was risen}</B> <b><i>(\anateilantos tou h&#275;liou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute, aorist participle, though some manuscripts<br>
 read \anatellontos\, present participle. <!-#-->Lu 24:1 has it "at<br>
 early dawn" <b><i>(\orthrou batheos\)</i></b> and <!-#-->Joh 20:1 "while it was yet<br>
 dark." It was some two miles from Bethany to the tomb. Mark<br>
 himself gives both notes of time, "very early" <b><i>(\lian pr&#333;i\)</i></b>,<br>
 "when the sun was risen." Probably they started while it was<br>
 still dark and the sun was coming up when they arrived at the<br>
 tomb. All three mention that it was on the first day of the week,<br>
 our Sunday morning when the women arrive. The body of Jesus was<br>
 buried late on Friday before the sabbath <b><i>(our Saturday)</i></b> which<br>
 began at sunset. This is made clear as a bell by <!-#-->Lu 23:54 "and<br>
 the sabbath drew on." The women rested on the sabbath <b><i>(<!-#-->Luke<br>
 23:56)</i></b>. This visit of the women was in the early morning of our<br>
 Sunday, the first day of the week. Some people are greatly<br>
 disturbed over the fact that Jesus did not remain in the grave<br>
 full seventy-two hours. But he repeatedly said that he would rise<br>
 on the third day and that is precisely what happened. He was<br>
 buried on Friday afternoon. He was risen on Sunday morning. If he<br>
 had really remained in the tomb full three days and then had<br>
 risen after that, it would have been on the fourth day, not on<br>
 the third day. The occasional phrase "after three days" is merely<br>
 a vernacular idiom common in all languages and not meant to be<br>
 exact and precise like "on the third day." We can readily<br>
 understand "after three days" in the sense of "on the third day."<br>
 It is impossible to understand "on the third day" to be "on the<br>
 fourth day." See my _Harmony of the Gospels_, pp. 289-91.<br>
 <br>
 16:3 <B>{Who shall roll us away the stone?}</B> <b><i>(\Tis apokulisei h&#275;min<br>
 ton lithon;\)</i></b>. Alone in Mark. The opposite of \proskuli&#333;\ in<br>
 <!-#-->15:46. In verse <!-#-->4 <B>{rolled back}</B> <b><i>(\anekekulistai\, perfect<br>
 passive indicative)</i></b> occurs also. Both verbs occur in _Koin&#275;_<br>
 writers and in the papyri. Clearly the women have no hope of the<br>
 resurrection of Jesus for they were raising the problem<br>
 <b><i>(\elegon\, imperfect)</i></b> as they walked along.<br>
 <br>
 16:4 <B>{Looking up they see}</B> <b><i>(\anablepsasai the&#333;rousin\)</i></b>. With<br>
 downcast eyes and heavy hearts <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b> they had been walking up<br>
 the hill. Mark has his frequent vivid dramatic present "behold."<br>
 Their problem is solved for the stone lies rolled back before<br>
 their very eyes. <!-#-->Lu 24:2 has the usual aorist "found." <B>{For}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\gar\)</i></b>. Mark explains by the size of the stone this sudden and<br>
 surprising sight right before their eyes.<br>
 <br>
 16:5 <B>{Entering into the tomb}</B> <b><i>(\eiselthousai eis to mn&#275;meion\)</i></b>.<br>
 Told also by <!-#-->Lu 24:3, though not by Matthew. <B>{A young man}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\neaniskon\)</i></b>. An angel in <!-#-->Mt 28:5, two men in <!-#-->Lu 24. These<br>
 and like variations in details show the independence of the<br>
 narrative and strengthen the evidence for the general fact of the<br>
 resurrection. The angel sat upon the stone <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 28:2)</i></b>, probably<br>
 at first. Mark here speaks of the young man <B>{sitting on the right<br>
 side}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#275;menon en tois dexiois\)</i></b> inside the tomb. Luke has<br>
 the two men standing by them on the inside <b><i>(<!-#-->Luke 24:4)</i></b>.<br>
 Possibly different aspects and stages of the incident. <B>{Arrayed<br>
 in a white robe}</B> <b><i>(\peribebl&#275;menon stol&#275;n leuk&#275;n\)</i></b>. Perfect<br>
 passive participle with the accusative case of the thing retained<br>
 <b><i>(verb of clothing)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu 24:4 has "in dazzling apparel." <B>{They<br>
 were amazed}</B> <b><i>(\exethamb&#275;th&#275;san\)</i></b>. They were utterly <b><i>(\ex\ in<br>
 composition)</i></b> amazed. <!-#-->Lu 24:5 has it "affrighted." <!-#-->Mt 28:3f.<br>
 tells more of the raiment white as snow which made the watchers<br>
 quake and become as dead men. But this was before the arrival of<br>
 the women. Mark, like Matthew and Luke, does not mention the<br>
 sudden departure of Mary Magdalene to tell Peter and John of the<br>
 grave robbery as she supposed <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 20:1-10)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:6 <B>{Be not amazed}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; ekthambeisthe\)</i></b>. The angel noted their<br>
 amazement <b><i>(verse <!-#-->5)</i></b> and urges the cessation of it using this<br>
 very word. <B>{The Nazarene}</B> <b><i>(\ton Nazar&#275;non\)</i></b>. Only in Mark, to<br>
 identify "Jesus" to the women. <B>{The crucified one}</B> <b><i>(\ton<br>
 estaur&#333;menon\)</i></b>. This also in <!-#-->Mt 28:5. This description of his<br>
 shame has become his crown of glory, for Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->Gal 6:14)</i></b>, and<br>
 for all who look to the Crucified and Risen Christ as Saviour and<br>
 Lord. He is risen <b><i>(\&#275;gerth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative,<br>
 the simple fact. In <!-#-->1Co 15:4 Paul uses the perfect passive<br>
 indicative \eg&#275;gertai\ to emphasize the permanent state that<br>
 Jesus remains risen. <B>{Behold the place}</B> <b><i>(\ide ho topos\)</i></b>. Here<br>
 \ide\ is used as an interjection with no effect on the case<br>
 <b><i>(nominative)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Mt 28:6 \idete\ is the verb with the<br>
 accusative. See Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 302.<br>
 <br>
 16:7 <B>{And Peter}</B> <b><i>(\kai t&#333;i Petr&#333;i\)</i></b>. Only in Mark, showing that<br>
 Peter remembered gratefully this special message from the Risen<br>
 Christ. Later in the day Jesus will appear also to Peter, an<br>
 event that changed doubt to certainty with the apostles <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 24:34; 1Co 15:5)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 28:7 for discussion of promised<br>
 meeting in Galilee.<br>
 <br>
 16:8 <B>{Had come upon them}</B> <b><i>(\eichen autas\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense, more<br>
 exactly, <B>{held them, was holding them fast}</B>. <B>{Trembling and<br>
 astonishment}</B> <b><i>(\tromos kai ekstasis\, trembling and ecstasy)</i></b>,<br>
 Mark has it, while <!-#-->Mt 28:8 has "with fear and great joy" which<br>
 see for discussion. Clearly and naturally their emotions were<br>
 mixed. <B>{They said nothing to any one}</B> <b><i>(\oudeni ouden eipan\)</i></b>.<br>
 This excitement was too great for ordinary conversation. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 28:8 notes that they "ran to bring his disciples word." Hushed<br>
 to silence their feet had wings as they flew on. <B>{For they were<br>
 afraid}</B> <b><i>(\ephobounto gar\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense. The continued fear<br>
 explains their continued silence. At this point Aleph and B, the<br>
 two oldest and best Greek manuscripts of the New Testament, stop<br>
 with this verse. Three Armenian MSS. also end here. Some<br>
 documents <b><i>(cursive 274 and Old Latin k)</i></b> have a shorter ending<br>
 than the usual long one. The great mass of the documents have the<br>
 long ending seen in the English versions. Some have both the long<br>
 and the short endings, like L, Psi, 0112, 099, 579, two Bohairic<br>
 MSS; the Harklean Syriac <b><i>(long one in the text, short one in the<br>
 Greek margin)</i></b>. One Armenian MS. <b><i>(at Edschmiadzin)</i></b> gives the long<br>
 ending and attributes it to Ariston <b><i>(possibly the Aristion of<br>
 Papias)</i></b>. W <b><i>(the Washington Codex)</i></b> has an additional verse in the<br>
 long ending. So the facts are very complicated, but argue<br>
 strongly against the genuineness of verses <!-#-->9-20 of Mark 16.<br>
 There is little in these verses not in <!-#-->Mt 28. It is difficult<br>
 to believe that Mark ended his Gospel with verse <!-#-->8 unless he<br>
 was interrupted. A leaf or column may have been torn off at the<br>
 end of the papyrus roll. The loss of the ending was treated in<br>
 various ways. Some documents left it alone. Some added one<br>
 ending, some another, some added both. A full discussion of the<br>
 facts is found in the last chapter of my _Studies in Mark's<br>
 Gospel_ and also in my _Introduction to the Textual Criticism of<br>
 the New Testament_, pp. 214-16.<br>
 <br>
 16:9 <B>{When he had risen early on the first day of the week}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anastas pr&#333;i pr&#333;t&#275;i sabbatou\)</i></b>. It is probable that this note<br>
 of time goes with "risen" <b><i>(\anastas\)</i></b>, though it makes good sense<br>
 with "appeared" <b><i>(\ephan&#275;\)</i></b>. Jesus is not mentioned by name here,<br>
 though he is clearly the one meant. Mark uses \mia\ in verse <!-#-->2,<br>
 but \pr&#333;t&#275;\ in <!-#-->14:12 and the plural \sabbat&#333;n\ in verse <!-#-->2,<br>
 though the singular here. <B>{First}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;ton\)</i></b>. Definite statement<br>
 that Jesus <B>{appeared}</B> <b><i>(\ephan&#275;\)</i></b> to Mary Magdalene first of all.<br>
 The verb \ephan&#275;\ <b><i>(second aorist passive of \phain&#333;\)</i></b> is here<br>
 alone of the Risen Christ <b><i>(cf. \Eleias ephan&#275;\, <!-#-->Lu 9:8)</i></b>, the<br>
 usual verb being \&#333;phth&#275;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:34; 1Co 15:5ff.)</i></b>. <B>{From whom}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\par' h&#275;s\)</i></b>. Only instance of \para\ with the casting out of<br>
 demons, \ek\ being usual <b><i>(<!-#-->1:25,26; 5:8; 7:26,29; 9:25)</i></b>.<br>
 \Ekbebl&#275;kei\ is past perfect indicative without augment. This<br>
 description of Mary Magdalene is like that in <!-#-->Lu 8:2 and seems<br>
 strange in Mark at this point, described as a new character here,<br>
 though mentioned by Mark three times just before <b><i>(<!-#-->15:40,47;<br>
 16:1)</i></b>. The appearance to Mary Magdalene is given in full by <!-#-->Joh<br>
 20:11-18.<br>
 <br>
 16:10 <B>{She}</B> <b><i>(\ekein&#275;\)</i></b>. Only instance of this pronoun <b><i>(=\illa\)</i></b><br>
 absolutely in Mark, though a good Greek idiom. <b><i>(See <!-#-->Joh 19:35.)</i></b><br>
 See also verses <!-#-->11,20. <B>{Went}</B> <b><i>(\poreutheisa\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive participle. Common word for going, but in Mark so far<br>
 only in <!-#-->9:30 in the uncompounded form. Here also in verses<br>
 <!-#-->12,15. <B>{Them that had been with him}</B> <b><i>(\tois met' autou<br>
 genomenois\)</i></b>. This phrase for the disciples occurs here alone in<br>
 Mark and the other Gospels if the disciples <b><i>(\math&#275;tai\)</i></b> are<br>
 meant. All these items suggest another hand than Mark for this<br>
 closing portion. <B>{As they mourned and wept}</B> <b><i>(\penthousin kai<br>
 klaiousin\)</i></b>. Present active participles in dative plural agreeing<br>
 with \tois ... genomenois\ and describing the pathos of the<br>
 disciples in their utter bereavement and woe.<br>
 <br>
 16:11 <B>{Disbelieved}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;pist&#275;san\)</i></b>. This verb is common in the<br>
 ancient Greek, but rare in the N.T. and here again verse <!-#-->16 and<br>
 nowhere else in Mark. The usual N.T. word is \apeithe&#333;\. <!-#-->Lu<br>
 24:11 uses this verb <b><i>(\&#275;pistoun\)</i></b> of the disbelief of the report<br>
 of Mary Magdalene and the other women. The verb \etheath&#275;\ <b><i>(from<br>
 \thea&#333;mai\)</i></b> occurs only here and in verse <!-#-->14 in Mark.<br>
 <br>
 16:12 <B>{After these things}</B> <b><i>(\meta tauta\)</i></b>. Only here in Mark.<br>
 Luke tells us that it was on the same day <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:13)</i></b>. <B>{In<br>
 another form}</B> <b><i>(\en heter&#257;i morph&#275;i\)</i></b>. It was not a<br>
 \metamorph&#333;sis\ or transfiguration like that described in <!-#-->9:2.<br>
 Luke explains that their eyes were holden so that they could not<br>
 recognize Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:16)</i></b>. This matchless story appears in<br>
 full in <!-#-->Lu 24:13-32.<br>
 <br>
 16:13 <B>{Neither believed they them}</B> <b><i>(\oude ekeinois episteusan\)</i></b>.<br>
 The men fared no better than the women. But Luke's report of the<br>
 two on the way to Emmaus is to the effect that they met a hearty<br>
 welcome by them in Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:33-35)</i></b>. This shows the<br>
 independence of the two narratives on this point. There was<br>
 probably an element who still discredited all the resurrection<br>
 stories as was true on the mountain in Galilee later when "some<br>
 doubted" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 28:17)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:14 <B>{To the eleven themselves}</B> <b><i>(\autois tois hendeka\)</i></b>. Both<br>
 terms, eleven and twelve <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 20:24)</i></b>, occur after the death of<br>
 Judas. There were others present on this first Sunday evening<br>
 according to <!-#-->Lu 24:33. <B>{Afterward}</B> <b><i>(\husteron\)</i></b> is here alone<br>
 in Mark, though common in Matthew. <B>{Upbraided}</B> <b><i>(\&#333;neidisen\)</i></b>.<br>
 They were guilty of unbelief <b><i>(\apistian\)</i></b> and hardness of heart<br>
 <b><i>(\skl&#275;rokardian\)</i></b>. Doubt is not necessarily a mark of<br>
 intellectual superiority. One must steer between credulity and<br>
 doubt. That problem is a vital one today in all educated circles.<br>
 Some of the highest men of science today are devout believers in<br>
 the Risen Christ. Luke explains how the disciples were upset by<br>
 the sudden appearance of Christ and were unable to believe the<br>
 evidence of their own senses <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:38-43)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:15 <B>{To the whole creation}</B> <b><i>(\p&#257;s&#275;i t&#275;i ktisei\)</i></b>. This<br>
 commission in Mark is probably another report of the missionary<br>
 _Magna Charta_ in <!-#-->Mt 28:16-20 spoken on the mountain in<br>
 Galilee. One commission has already been given by Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 20:21-23)</i></b>. The third appears in <!-#-->Lu 24:44-49; Ac 1:3-8.<br>
 <br>
 16:16 <B>{And is baptized}</B> <b><i>(\kai baptistheis\)</i></b>. The omission of<br>
 <B>{baptized}</B> with "disbelieveth" would seem to show that Jesus does<br>
 not make baptism essential to salvation. Condemnation rests on<br>
 disbelief, not on baptism. So salvation rests on belief. Baptism<br>
 is merely the picture of the new life not the means of securing<br>
 it. So serious a sacramental doctrine would need stronger support<br>
 anyhow than this disputed portion of Mark.<br>
 <br>
 16:17 <B>{They shall speak with new tongues}</B> <b><i>(\gl&#333;ssais lal&#275;sousin<br>
 [kainais]\)</i></b>. Westcott and Hort put \kainais\ <b><i>(new)</i></b> in the margin.<br>
 Casting out demons we have seen in the ministry of Jesus.<br>
 Speaking with tongues comes in the apostolic era <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 2:3f.;<br>
 10:46; 19:6; 1Co 12:28; 14)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:18 <B>{They shall take up serpents}</B> <b><i>(\opheis arousin\)</i></b>. Jesus had<br>
 said something like this in <!-#-->Lu 10:19 and Paul was unharmed by<br>
 the serpent in Malta <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 28:3f.)</i></b>. <B>{If they drink any deadly<br>
 thing}</B> <b><i>(\k'an thanasimon ti pi&#333;sin\)</i></b>. This is the only N.T.<br>
 instance of the old Greek word \thanasimos\ <b><i>(deadly)</i></b>. <!-#-->Jas 3:8<br>
 has \thanat&#275;phoros\, deathbearing. Bruce considers these verses<br>
 in Mark "a great lapse from the high level of Matthew's version<br>
 of the farewell words of Jesus" and holds that "taking up<br>
 venomous serpents and drinking deadly poison seem to introduce us<br>
 into the twilight of apocryphal story." The great doubt<br>
 concerning the genuineness of these verses <b><i>(fairly conclusive<br>
 proof against them in my opinion)</i></b> renders it unwise to take these<br>
 verses as the foundation for doctrine or practice unless<br>
 supported by other and genuine portions of the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 16:19 <B>{Was received up into heaven}</B> <b><i>(\anel&#275;mpth&#275; eis ton<br>
 ouranon\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative. Luke gives the fact<br>
 of the Ascension twice in Gospel <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:50f.)</i></b> and <!-#-->Ac 1:9-11.<br>
 The Ascension in Mark took place after Jesus spoke to the<br>
 disciples, not in Galilee <b><i>(<!-#-->16:15-18)</i></b>, nor on the first or<br>
 second Sunday evening in Jerusalem. We should not know when it<br>
 took place nor where but for Luke who locates it on Olivet <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 24:50)</i></b> at the close of the forty days <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 1:3)</i></b> and so after<br>
 the return from Galilee <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 28:16)</i></b>. <B>{Sat down at the right hand<br>
 of God}</B> <b><i>(\ekathisen ek dexi&#333;n tou theou\)</i></b>. Swete notes that the<br>
 author "passes beyond the field of history into that of<br>
 theology," an early and most cherished belief <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 7:55f.; Ro<br>
 8:34; Eph 1:20; Col 3:1; Heb 1:3; 8:1; 10:12; 12:2; 1Pe 3:22; Re<br>
 3:21)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:20 <B>{The Lord working with them}</B> <b><i>(\tou kuriou sunergountos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute. This participle not in Gospels elsewhere nor<br>
 is \bebaiountos\ nor the compound \epakolouthount&#333;n\, all in<br>
 Paul's Epistles. \Pantacho&#8211;\ once in Luke. Westcott and Hort give<br>
 the alternative ending found in L: "And they announced briefly to<br>
 Peter and those around him all the things enjoined. And after<br>
 these things Jesus himself also sent forth through them from the<br>
 east even unto the west the holy and incorruptible proclamation<br>
 of the eternal salvation."<br>
