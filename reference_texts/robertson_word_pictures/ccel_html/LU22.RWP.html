<p>22:1 <B>{The Passover}</B> <b><i>(\pascha\)</i></b> Both names <b><i>(unleavened bread and<br>
 passover)</i></b> are used here as in <!-#-->Mr 14:1. Strictly speaking the<br>
 passover was Nisan 14 and the unleavened bread 15-21. This is the<br>
 only place in the N.T. where the expression "the feast of<br>
 unleavened bread" <b><i>(common in LXX, <!-#-->Ex. 23:15, etc.)</i></b> occurs, for<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 14:1 has just "the unleavened bread." <!-#-->Mt 26:17 uses<br>
 unleavened bread and passover interchangeably. <B>{Drew nigh}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;ggizen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. <!-#-->Mr 14:1; Mt 26:2 mention "after<br>
 two days" definitely.<br>
 <br>
 22:2 <B>{Sought}</B> <b><i>(\ez&#275;toun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \z&#275;te&#333;\, were<br>
 seeking, conative imperfect. <B>{How they might put him to death}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\to p&#333;s anel&#333;sin auton\)</i></b>. Second aorist active deliberative<br>
 subjunctive <b><i>(retained in indirect question)</i></b> of \anaire&#333;\, to take<br>
 up, to make away with, to slay. Common in Old Greek. Luke uses it<br>
 so here and in <!-#-->23:32 and eighteen times in the Acts, a<br>
 favourite word with him. Note the accusative neuter singular<br>
 article \to\ with the whole clause, "as to the how, etc." <B>{For<br>
 they feared}</B> <b><i>(\ephobounto gar\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle describing the<br>
 delay of the "how." The triumphal entry and the temple speeches<br>
 of Jesus had revealed his tremendous power with the people,<br>
 especially the crowds from Galilee at the feast. They were afraid<br>
 to go on with their plan to kill him at the feast.<br>
 <br>
 22:3 <B>{Satan entered into Judas}</B> <b><i>(\eis&#275;lthen eis Ioudan\)</i></b>.<br>
 Ingressive aorist active indicative. Satan was now renewing his<br>
 attack on Jesus suspended temporarily <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 4:13)</i></b> "until a good<br>
 chance." He had come back by the use of Simon Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 8:33; Mt<br>
 16:23)</i></b>. The conflict went on and Jesus won ultimate victory <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 10:18)</i></b>. Now Satan uses Judas and has success with him for Judas<br>
 allowed him to come again and again <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 13:27)</i></b>. Judas<br>
 evidently opened the door to his heart and let Satan in. Then<br>
 Satan took charge and he became a devil as Jesus said <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 6:70)</i></b>. This surrender to Satan in no way relieves Judas of his<br>
 moral responsibility.<br>
 <br>
 22:4 <B>{Went away}</B> <b><i>(\apelth&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of<br>
 \aperchomai\. He went off under the impulse of Satan and after<br>
 the indignation over the rebuke of Jesus at the feast in Simon's<br>
 house <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 12:4-6)</i></b>. <B>{Captains}</B> <b><i>(\strat&#275;gois\)</i></b>. Leaders of the<br>
 temple guards <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 4:1)</i></b>, the full title, "captains of the<br>
 temple," occurs in verse <!-#-->52. <B>{How he might deliver him unto<br>
 them}</B> <b><i>(\to p&#333;s autois parad&#333;i auton\)</i></b>. The same construction as<br>
 in verse <!-#-->2, the article \to\ with the indirect question and<br>
 deliberative subjunctive second aorist active <b><i>(\parad&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:5 <B>{Were glad}</B> <b><i>(\echar&#275;san\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive indicative<br>
 of \chair&#333;\ as in <!-#-->Mr 14:11. Ingressive aorist, a natural<br>
 exultation that one of the Twelve had offered to do this thing.<br>
 <B>{Covenanted}</B> <b><i>(\sunethento\)</i></b>. Second aorist indicative middle of<br>
 \suntith&#275;mi\. An old verb to put together and in the middle with<br>
 one another. In the N.T. outside of <!-#-->Joh 9:22 only in Luke <b><i>(here<br>
 and <!-#-->Ac 23:20; 24:9)</i></b>. Luke only mentions "money" <b><i>(\argurion\)</i></b>,<br>
 but not "thirty pieces" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 26:15)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:6 <B>{Consented}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#333;molog&#275;sen\)</i></b>. Old verb, but the ancients<br>
 usually used the simple form for promise or consent rather than<br>
 the compound. This is the only instance of this sense in the N.T.<br>
 It is from \homologos\ <b><i>(\homos\, same, and \leg&#333;\, to say)</i></b>, to<br>
 say the same thing with another and so agree. <B>{Opportunity}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eukarian\)</i></b>. From \eukairos\ <b><i>(\eu, kairos\)</i></b>, a good chance. Old<br>
 word, but in the N.T. only here and parallel passage <!-#-->Mt 26:16.<br>
 <B>{In the absence of the multitude}</B> <b><i>(\ater ochlou\)</i></b>. \Ater\ is an<br>
 old preposition, common in the poets, but rare in prose. Also in<br>
 verse <!-#-->35. It means "without," "apart from," like \ch&#333;ris\. The<br>
 point of Judas was just this. He would get Jesus into the hands<br>
 of the Sanhedrin during the feast in spite of the crowd. It was<br>
 necessary to avoid tumult <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 26:5)</i></b> because of the popularity<br>
 of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 22:7 <B>{The day of unleavened bread came}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;lthen h&#275; h&#275;mera t&#333;n<br>
 azum&#333;n\)</i></b>. The day itself came, not simply was drawing nigh <b><i>(verse<br>
 <!-#-->1)</i></b>. <B>{Must be sacrificed}</B> <b><i>(\edei thuesthai\)</i></b>. This was Nisan 14<br>
 which began at sunset. Luke is a Gentile and this fact must be<br>
 borne in mind. The lamb must be slain by the head of the family<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 12:6)</i></b>. The controversy about the day when Christ ate the<br>
 last passover meal has already been discussed <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 26:17; Mr<br>
 14:12)</i></b>. The Synoptics clearly present this as a fact. Jesus was<br>
 then crucified on Friday at the passover or Thursday <b><i>(our time)</i></b><br>
 at the regular hour 6 P.M. <b><i>(beginning of Friday)</i></b>. The five<br>
 passages in John <b><i>(<!-#-->13:1f.; 13:27; 18:28; 19:14; 19:31)</i></b> rightly<br>
 interpreted teach the same thing as shown in my _Harmony of the<br>
 Gospels for Students of the Life of Christ_ <b><i>(pp.279-284)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:8 <B>{Peter and John}</B> <b><i>(\Petron kai I&#333;an&#275;n\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr 14:13 has only<br>
 "two" while <!-#-->Mt 26:17 makes the disciples take the initiative.<br>
 The word passover in this context is used either of the meal, the<br>
 feast day, the whole period <b><i>(including the unleavened bread)</i></b>.<br>
 "Eat the passover" can refer to the meal as here or to the whole<br>
 period of celebration <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:28)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:9 <B>{Where wilt thou that we make ready?}</B> <b><i>(\Pou theleis<br>
 hetoimas&#333;men;\)</i></b>. Deliberative first aorist active subjunctive<br>
 without \hina\ after \theleis\, perhaps originally two separate<br>
 questions.<br>
 <br>
 22:10 <B>{When you are entered}</B> <b><i>(\eiselthont&#333;n hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute. <B>{Meet you}</B> <b><i>(\sunant&#275;sei humin\)</i></b>. An old verb \sunanta&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(from \sun\, with, and \anta&#333;\, to face, \anti\)</i></b> with associative<br>
 instrumental <b><i>(\humin\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mr 14:13 about the "man bearing<br>
 a pitcher of water."<br>
 <br>
 22:11 <B>{Goodman of the house}</B> <b><i>(\oikodespot&#275;i\)</i></b>. Master of the<br>
 house as in <!-#-->Mr 14:14; Mt 10:25. A late word for the earlier<br>
 \despot&#275;s oikou\. <B>{I shall eat}</B> <b><i>(\phag&#333;\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 futuristic <b><i>(or deliberative)</i></b> subjunctive as in <!-#-->Mr 14:14.<br>
 <br>
 22:12 <B>{And he}</B> <b><i>(\k'akeinos\)</i></b>. \Kai\ and \ekeinos\ <b><i>(\crasis\)</i></b><br>
 where <!-#-->Mr 14:15 has \kai autos\. Literally, And that one. See on<br>
 Mark for rest of the verse.<br>
 <br>
 22:13 <B>{He had said}</B> <b><i>(\eir&#275;kei\)</i></b>. Past perfect active indicative<br>
 of \eipon\ where <!-#-->Mr 14:16 has \eipen\ <b><i>(second aorist)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:14 <B>{Sat down}</B> <b><i>(\anepesen\)</i></b>. Reclined, fell back <b><i>(or up)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist active of \anapipt&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 22:15 <B>{With desire I have desired}</B> <b><i>(\epithumi&#257;i epethum&#275;sa\)</i></b>. A<br>
 Hebraism common in the LXX. Associative instrumental case of<br>
 substantive and first aorist active indicative of same like a<br>
 cognate accusative. Peculiar to Luke is all this verse. See this<br>
 idiom in <!-#-->Joh 3:29; Ac 4:17. <B>{Before I suffer}</B> <b><i>(\pro tou me<br>
 pathein\)</i></b>. Preposition \pro\ with articular infinitive and<br>
 accusative of general reference, "before the suffering as to me."<br>
 \Pathein\ is second aorist active infinitive of \pasch&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 22:16 <B>{Until it be fulfilled}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s hotou pl&#275;r&#333;th&#275;i\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive subjunctive of \pl&#275;ro&#333;\ with \he&#333;s\ <b><i>(\hotou\)</i></b>, the<br>
 usual construction about the future. It seems like a Messianic<br>
 banquet that Jesus has in mind <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->14:15)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:17 <B>{He received a cup}</B> <b><i>(\dexamenos pot&#275;rion\)</i></b>. This cup is a<br>
 diminutive of \pot&#275;r\. It seems that this is still one of the<br>
 four cups passed during the passover meal, though which one is<br>
 uncertain. It is apparently just before the formal introduction<br>
 of the Lord's Supper, though he gave thanks here also<br>
 <b><i>(\eucharist&#275;sas\)</i></b>. It is from this verb \euchariste&#333;\ <b><i>(see also<br>
 verse <!-#-->19)</i></b> that our word Eucharist comes. It is a common verb<br>
 for giving thanks and was used also for "saying grace" as we call<br>
 it.<br>
 <br>
 22:18 <B>{The fruit of the vine}</B> <b><i>(\tou gen&#275;matos t&#275;s ampelou\)</i></b>. So<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 14:25; Mt 26:29 and not \oinos\ though it was wine<br>
 undoubtedly. But the language allows anything that is "the fruit<br>
 of the vine." <B>{Come}</B> <b><i>(\elth&#275;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist active subjunctive<br>
 with \he&#333;s\ as in verse <!-#-->16. Here it is the consummation of the<br>
 kingdom that Jesus has in mind, for the kingdom had already come.<br>
 <br>
 22:19 <B>{Which is given for you}</B> <b><i>(\to huper hum&#333;n didomenon\)</i></b>. Some<br>
 MSS. omit these verses though probably genuine. The correct text<br>
 in <!-#-->1Co 11:24 has "which is for you," not "which is broken for<br>
 you." It is curious to find the word "broken" here preserved and<br>
 justified so often, even by Easton in his commentary on Luke, p.<br>
 320. <B>{In remembrance of me}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n em&#275;n anamn&#275;sin\)</i></b>. Objective<br>
 use of the possessive pronoun \em&#275;n\, not the subjective. <B>{This<br>
 do}</B> <b><i>(\touto poieite\)</i></b>. Present active indicative, repetition,<br>
 keep on doing this.<br>
 <br>
 22:20 <B>{After the supper}</B> <b><i>(\meta to deipn&#275;sai\)</i></b>. Preposition<br>
 \meta\ and the accusative articular infinitive. The textual<br>
 situation here is confusing, chiefly because of the two cups<br>
 <b><i>(verses <!-#-->17,20)</i></b>. Some of the documents omit the latter part of<br>
 verse <!-#-->19 and all of verse <!-#-->20. It is possible, of course, that<br>
 this part crept into the text of Luke from <!-#-->1Co 11:24f. But, if<br>
 this part is omitted, Luke would then have the order reversed,<br>
 the cup before the bread. So there are difficulties whichever<br>
 turn one takes here with Luke's text whether one cup or two cups.<br>
 <B>{The New Covenant}</B> <b><i>(\he kain&#275; diath&#275;k&#275;\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 26:28; Mr<br>
 14:24 for "covenant." Westcott and Hort reject "new" there, but<br>
 accept it here and in <!-#-->1Co 11:25. See on &#175;Lu 5:38 for<br>
 difference between \kain&#275;\ and \nea\. "The ratification of a<br>
 covenant was commonly associated with the shedding of blood; and<br>
 what was written in blood was believed to be indelible"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{Poured out}</B> <b><i>(\ekchunnomenon\)</i></b>. Same word in <!-#-->Mr<br>
 14:24; Mt 26:28 translated "shed." Late form present passive<br>
 participle of \ekchunn&#333;\ of \ekche&#333;\, to pour out.<br>
 <br>
 22:21 <B>{That betrayeth}</B> <b><i>(\tou paradidontos\)</i></b>. Present active<br>
 participle, actually engaged in doing it. The hand of Judas was<br>
 resting on the table at the moment. It should be noted that Luke<br>
 narrates the institution of the Lord's Supper before the exposure<br>
 of Judas as the traitor while Mark and Matthew reverse this<br>
 order.<br>
 <br>
 22:22 <B>{As it hath been determined}</B> <b><i>(\kata to h&#333;rismenon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Perfect passive participle of \horiz&#333;\, to limit or define, mark<br>
 off the border, our "horizon." But this fact does not absolve<br>
 Judas of his guilt as the "woe" here makes plain.<br>
 <br>
 22:23 <B>{Which of them it was}</B> <b><i>(\to tis ara ei&#275; ex aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Note<br>
 the article \to\ with the indirect question as in verses <!-#-->2,4.<br>
 The optative \ei&#275;\ here is changed from the present active<br>
 indicative \estin\, though it was not always done, for see<br>
 \dokei\ in verse <!-#-->24 where the present indicative is retained.<br>
 They all had their hands on the table. Whose hand was it?<br>
 <br>
 22:24 <B>{Contention}</B> <b><i>(\philoneikia\)</i></b>. An old word from<br>
 \philoneikos\, fond of strife, eagerness to contend. Only here in<br>
 the N.T. <B>{Greatest}</B> <b><i>(\meiz&#333;n\)</i></b>. Common use of the comparative as<br>
 superlative.<br>
 <br>
 22:25 <B>{Have lordship over}</B> <b><i>(\kurieuousin\)</i></b>. From \kurios\. Common<br>
 verb, to lord it over. <B>{Benefactors}</B> <b><i>(\euergetai\)</i></b>. From \eu\ and<br>
 \ergon\. Doer of good. Old word. Here only in the N.T. Latin<br>
 Benefactor is exact equivalent.<br>
 <br>
 22:26 <B>{Become}</B> <b><i>(\ginesth&#333;\)</i></b>. Present middle imperative of<br>
 \ginomai\. Act so. True greatness is in service, not in rank.<br>
 <br>
 22:27 <B>{But I}</B> <b><i>(\Eg&#333; de\)</i></b>. Jesus dares to cite his own conduct,<br>
 though their leader, to prove his point and to put a stop to<br>
 their jealous contention for the chief place at this very feast,<br>
 a wrangling that kept up till Jesus had to arise and give them<br>
 the object lesson of humility by washing their feet <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 13:1-20)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:28 <B>{In my temptations}</B> <b><i>(\en tois peirasmois mou\)</i></b>. Probably<br>
 "trials" is better here as in <!-#-->Jas 1:2 though temptations<br>
 clearly in <!-#-->Jas 1:13ff. This is the tragedy of the situation<br>
 when Jesus is facing the Cross with the traitor at the table and<br>
 the rest chiefly concerned about their own primacy and dignity.<br>
 <br>
 22:29 <B>{And I appoint unto you}</B> <b><i>(\k'ag&#333; diatith&#275;mai humin\)</i></b>. They<br>
 had on the whole been loyal and so Jesus passes on to them<br>
 <b><i>(\diath&#275;mai\ verb from which \diath&#275;k&#275;\ comes)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:30 <B>{And ye shall sit}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#275;sesthe\)</i></b>. But Westcott and Hort<br>
 read in the text \kath&#275;sthe\ <b><i>(present middle subjunctive with<br>
 \hina\)</i></b>. The picture seems to be that given in <!-#-->Mt 19:28 when<br>
 Jesus replied to Peter's inquiry. It is not clear how literally<br>
 this imagery is to be taken. But there is the promise of honour<br>
 for the loyal among these in the end.<br>
 <br>
 22:31 <B>{Asked to have you}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#275;it&#275;sato\)</i></b>. First aorist indirect<br>
 middle indicative of \exaite&#333;\, an old verb to beg something of<br>
 one and <b><i>(middle)</i></b> for oneself. Only here in the N.T. The verb is<br>
 used either in the good or the bad sense, but it does not mean<br>
 here "obtained by asking" as margin in Revised Version has it.<br>
 <B>{That he might sift you}</B> <b><i>(\tou siniasai\)</i></b>. Genitive articular<br>
 infinitive of purpose. First aorist active infinitive of<br>
 \siniaz&#333;\, to shake a sieve, to sift, from \sinion\, a winnowing<br>
 fan. Later word. Here only in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 22:32 <B>{That thy faith fail not}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275; eklip&#275;i he pistis<br>
 mou\)</i></b>. Second aorist active subjunctive of purpose with \hina\<br>
 after \ede&#275;th&#275;n\ <b><i>(<B>{I prayed}</B>)</i></b> of \ekleip&#333;\, old verb. Our word<br>
 _eclipse_ is this word. Evidently Jesus could not keep Satan from<br>
 attacking Peter. He had already captured Judas. Did he not<br>
 repeatedly attack Jesus? But he could and did pray for Peter's<br>
 faith and his praying won in the end, though Peter stumbled and<br>
 fell. <B>{And do thou}</B> <b><i>(\kai su\)</i></b>. The words single out Peter<br>
 sharply. <B>{Once thou hast turned again}</B> <b><i>(\pote epistrepsas\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active participle of \epistreph&#333;\, common verb to<br>
 turn to, to return. But the use of this word implied that Peter<br>
 would fall though he would come back and "strengthen thy<br>
 brethren."<br>
 <br>
 22:33 <B>{To prison and to death}</B> <b><i>(\eis phulak&#275;n kai eis thanaton\)</i></b>.<br>
 Evidently Peter was not flattered by the need of Christ's earnest<br>
 prayers for his welfare and loyalty. Hence this loud boast.<br>
 <br>
 22:34 <B>{Until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s<br>
 tris me aparn&#275;s&#275;i eidenai\)</i></b>. "Thrice" is in all four Gospels here<br>
 for they all give this warning to Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:30; Mt 26:34; Lu<br>
 22:34; Joh 18:38)</i></b>. Peter will even deny knowing Jesus<br>
 <b><i>(\eidenai\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:35 <B>{Without purse}</B> <b><i>(\ater ballantiou\)</i></b>. Money bag or purse.<br>
 Old word, but in the N.T. only in Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->10:4; 12:33; 22:35ff.)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Wallet}</B> <b><i>(\p&#275;ras\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 10:10. <B>{Lacked ye anything}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;<br>
 tinos huster&#275;sate;\)</i></b>. Answer No expected <b><i>(\outhenos\ below)</i></b>.<br>
 Ablative case after \hustere&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 22:36 <B>{Buy a sword}</B> <b><i>(\agorasat&#333; machairan\)</i></b>. This is for defence<br>
 clearly. The reference is to the special mission in Galilee <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 9:1-6; Mr 6:6-13; Mt 9:35-11:1)</i></b>. They are to expect persecution<br>
 and bitter hostility <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 15:18-21)</i></b>. Jesus does not mean that<br>
 his disciples are to repel force by force, but that they are to<br>
 be ready to defend his cause against attack. Changed conditions<br>
 bring changed needs. This language can be misunderstood as it was<br>
 then.<br>
 <br>
 22:38 <B>{Lord, behold, here are two swords}</B> <b><i>(\kurie idou machairai<br>
 h&#333;de duo\)</i></b>. They took his words literally. And before this very<br>
 night is over Peter will use one of these very swords to try to<br>
 cut off the head of Malchus only to be sternly rebuked by Jesus<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:47; Mt 26:51f.; Lu 22:50f.; Joh 18:10f.)</i></b>. Then Jesus<br>
 will say: "For all that take the sword shall perish with the<br>
 sword" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 26:52)</i></b>. Clearly Jesus did not mean his language even<br>
 about the sword to be pressed too literally. So he said: "It is<br>
 enough" <b><i>(\Hikanon estin\)</i></b>. It is with sad irony and sorrow that<br>
 Jesus thus dismisses the subject. They were in no humour now to<br>
 understand the various sides of this complicated problem. Every<br>
 preacher and teacher understands this mood, not of impatience,<br>
 but of closing the subject for the present.<br>
 <br>
 22:39 <B>{As his custom was}</B> <b><i>(\kata to ethos\)</i></b>. According to the<br>
 custom <b><i>(of him)</i></b>. It was because Judas knew the habit of Jesus of<br>
 going to Gethsemane at night that he undertook to betray him<br>
 without waiting for the crowd to go home after the feast.<br>
 <br>
 22:40 <B>{At the place}</B> <b><i>(\epi tou topou\)</i></b>. The place of secret<br>
 prayer which was dear to Jesus. <B>{Pray that ye enter not into<br>
 temptation}</B> <b><i>(\proseuchesthe m&#275; eiselthein eis peirasmon\)</i></b>. "Keep<br>
 on praying not to enter <b><i>(ingressive aorist infinitive, not even<br>
 once)</i></b> into temptation." It is real "temptation" here, not just<br>
 "trial." Jesus knew the power of temptation and the need of<br>
 prayer. These words throw a light on the meaning of his language<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 6:13. Jesus repeats this warning in verse <!-#-->46.<br>
 <br>
 22:41 <B>{About a stone's throw}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;sei lithou bol&#275;n\)</i></b>. Accusative<br>
 of extent of space. Luke does not tell of leaving eight disciples<br>
 by the entrance to Gethsemane nor about taking Peter, James, and<br>
 John further in with him. <B>{Kneeled down}</B> <b><i>(\theis ta gonata\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist active participle from \tith&#275;mi\. <!-#-->Mr 14:35 says<br>
 "fell on the ground" and <!-#-->Mt 26:39 "fell on his face." All could<br>
 be true at different moments. <B>{Prayed}</B> <b><i>(\pros&#275;ucheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 middle, was praying, kept on praying.<br>
 <br>
 22:42 <B>{If thou be willing}</B> <b><i>(\ei boulei\)</i></b>. This condition is in<br>
 the first petition at the start. <B>{Be done}</B> <b><i>(\ginesth&#333;\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 middle imperative, keep on being done, the Father's will.<br>
 <br>
 22:43 <B>{An angel}</B> <b><i>(\aggelos\)</i></b>. The angels visited Jesus at the<br>
 close of the three temptations at the beginning of his ministry<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 4:11)</i></b>. Here the angel comes during the conflict.<br>
 <br>
 22:44 <B>{In an agony}</B> <b><i>(\en ag&#333;ni&#257;i\)</i></b>. It was conflict, contest from<br>
 \ag&#333;n\. An old word, but only here in the N.T. Satan pressed<br>
 Jesus harder than ever before. <B>{As it were great drops of blood}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\h&#333;sei thromboi haimatos\)</i></b>. Thick, clotted blood. An old word<br>
 <b><i>(\thromboi\)</i></b> common in medical works, but here only in the N.T.<br>
 This passage <b><i>(verses <!-#-->43,44)</i></b> is absent from some ancient<br>
 documents. Aristotle speaks of a bloody sweat as does<br>
 Theophrastus.<br>
 <br>
 22:45 <B>{Sleeping for sorrow}</B> <b><i>(\koim&#333;menous apo t&#275;s lup&#275;s\)</i></b>. Luke<br>
 does not tell of the three turnings of Jesus to the trusted three<br>
 for human sympathy.<br>
 <br>
 22:46 <B>{Why sleep ye?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti katheudete;\)</i></b>. This reproach Luke<br>
 gives, but not the almost bitter details in <!-#-->Mr 14:37-42; Mt<br>
 26:40-46)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:47 <B>{Went before them}</B> <b><i>(\pro&#275;rcheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle. Judas<br>
 was leading the band for he knew the place well <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:2)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:48 <B>{With a kiss}</B> <b><i>(\phil&#275;mati\)</i></b>. Instrumental case. Jesus<br>
 challenges the act of Judas openly and calls it betrayal, but it<br>
 did not stop him.<br>
 <br>
 22:49 <B>{What would follow}</B> <b><i>(\to esomenon\)</i></b>. Article and the future<br>
 middle participle of \eimi\, to be. <B>{Shall we smite with a<br>
 sword?}</B> <b><i>(\ei pataxomen en machair&#275;i;\)</i></b>. Note \ei\ in a direct<br>
 question like the Hebrew. Luke alone gives this question.<br>
 Instrumental use of \en\. They had the two swords already<br>
 mentioned <b><i>(<!-#-->22:38)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:50 <B>{His right ear}</B> <b><i>(\to ous autou to dexion\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mark 14:47; Mt<br>
 26:51 do not mention "right," but Luke the Physician does. <!-#-->Joh<br>
 18:10 follows Luke in this item and also adds the names of Peter<br>
 and of Malchus since probably both were dead by that time and<br>
 Peter would not be involved in trouble.<br>
 <br>
 22:51 <B>{Suffer us thus far}</B> <b><i>(\e&#257;te he&#333;s toutou\)</i></b>. Present active<br>
 imperative of \ea&#333;\, to allow. But the meaning is not clear. If<br>
 addressed to Peter and the other disciples it means that they are<br>
 to suffer this much of violence against Jesus. This is probably<br>
 the idea. If it is addressed to the crowd, it means that they are<br>
 to excuse Peter for his rash act. <B>{He touched his ear and healed<br>
 him}</B> <b><i>(\hapsamenos tou otiou iasato auton\)</i></b>. Whether Jesus picked<br>
 up the piece of the ear and put it back is not said. He could<br>
 have healed the wound without that. This miracle of surgery is<br>
 given alone by Luke.<br>
 <br>
 22:52 <B>{As against a robber?}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s epi l&#275;ist&#275;n;\)</i></b>. They were<br>
 treating Jesus as if he were a bandit like Barabbas.<br>
 <br>
 22:53 <B>{But this is your hour}</B> <b><i>(\all' haut&#275; estin hum&#333;n h&#275; h&#333;ra\)</i></b>.<br>
 So Jesus surrenders. The moral value of his atoning sacrifice on<br>
 the Cross consists in the voluntariness of his death. He makes it<br>
 clear that they have taken undue advantage of him in this hour of<br>
 secret prayer and had failed to seize him in public in the<br>
 temple. But "the power of darkness" <b><i>(\h&#275; exousia tou skotous\)</i></b>,<br>
 had its turn. A better day will come. The might, authority of<br>
 darkness.<br>
 <br>
 22:54 <B>{Into the high priest's house}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n oikian tou<br>
 archiere&#333;s\)</i></b>. Luke alone mentions "the house." Though it is<br>
 implied in <!-#-->Mr 14:53; Mt 26:57. <B>{Followed}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kolouthei\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect, was following, as <!-#-->Mt 26:58; Joh 18:15. Curiously <!-#-->Mr<br>
 14:54 has the aorist.<br>
 <br>
 22:55 <B>{When they had kindled a fire}</B> <b><i>(\periapsant&#333;n pur\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute, first aorist active participle of \periapt&#333;\,<br>
 an old verb, but here only in the N.T. Kindle around, make a good<br>
 fire that blazes all over. It was April and cool at night. The<br>
 servants made the fire. <B>{And had sat down together}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 sunkathisant&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again. Note \sun-\<br>
 <b><i>(together)</i></b>, all had taken seats around the fire. <B>{Peter sat in<br>
 the midst of them}</B> <b><i>(\ekath&#275;to ho Petros mesos aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 tense, he was sitting, and note \mesos\, nominative predicate<br>
 adjective with the genitive, like <!-#-->Joh 1:26, good Greek idiom.<br>
 <br>
 22:56 <B>{In the light}</B> <b><i>(\pros to ph&#333;s\)</i></b>. Facing <b><i>(\pros\)</i></b> the light,<br>
 for the fire gave light as well as heat. <!-#-->Mr 14:65 has "warming<br>
 himself in the light," John <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:18,25)</i></b> "warming himself."<br>
 <B>{Looking steadfastly}</B> <b><i>(\atenisasa\)</i></b>. Favourite word in Luke<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->4:20, etc.)</i></b> for gazing steadily at one. <B>{This man also}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 houtos\)</i></b>. As if pointing to Peter and talking about him. The<br>
 other Gospels <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:67; Mt 26:69; Joh 18:25)</i></b> make a direct<br>
 address to Peter. Both could be true, as she turned to Peter.<br>
 <br>
 22:57 <B>{I know him not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk oida auton\)</i></b>. Just as Jesus had<br>
 predicted that he would do <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:34)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:58 <B>{After a little while another}</B> <b><i>(\meta brachu heteros\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 26:71 makes it after Peter had gone out into the porch and<br>
 mentions a maid as speaking as does <!-#-->Mr 14:69, while here the<br>
 "other" <b><i>(\heteros\)</i></b> is a man <b><i>(masculine gender)</i></b>. It is almost<br>
 impossible to co-ordinate the three denials in the four accounts<br>
 unless we conceive of several joining in when one led off. This<br>
 time Peter's denial is very blunt, "I am not."<br>
 <br>
 22:59 <B>{After the space of about one hour}</B> <b><i>(\diastas&#275;s h&#333;sei h&#333;ras<br>
 mias\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute with second aorist active participle<br>
 feminine singular of \diist&#275;mi\. This classical verb in the N.T.<br>
 is used only by Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->22:59; 24:51; Ac 27:28)</i></b>. It means<br>
 standing in two or apart, about an hour intervening. <B>{Confidently<br>
 affirmed}</B> <b><i>(\diischurizeto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, he kept affirming<br>
 strongly. An old verb <b><i>(\dia, ischurizomai\)</i></b>, to make oneself<br>
 strong, to make emphatic declaration. In the N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->Ac 12:15. <B>{For he is a Galilean}</B> <b><i>(\kai gar Galilaios estin\)</i></b>.<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 26:73 makes it plain that it was his speech that gave him<br>
 away, which see.<br>
 <br>
 22:60 <B>{I know not what thou sayest}</B> <b><i>(\ouk oida ho legeis\)</i></b>. Each<br>
 denial tangles Peter more and more. <B>{While he yet spake}</B> <b><i>(\eti<br>
 lalountos autou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute. Peter could hear the<br>
 crowing all right.<br>
 <br>
 22:61 <B>{The Lord turned}</B> <b><i>(\strapheis ho kurios\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 passive participle of \streph&#333;\, coming verb. Graphic picture<br>
 drawn by Luke alone. <B>{Looked upon Peter}</B> <b><i>(\eneblepsen t&#333;i<br>
 Petr&#333;i\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist active indicative of \enblep&#333;\, an<br>
 old and vivid verb, to glance at. <B>{Remembered}</B> <b><i>(\hupemn&#275;sth&#275;\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive indicative of \hupomimn&#275;sk&#333;\, common verb to<br>
 remind one of something <b><i>(\hupo\ giving a suggestion or hint)</i></b>. The<br>
 cock crowing and the look brought swiftly back to Peter's mind<br>
 the prophecy of Jesus and his sad denials. The mystery is how he<br>
 had forgotten that warning.<br>
 <br>
 22:62 <B>{And he went out and wept bitterly}</B> <b><i>(\kai exelth&#333;n ex&#333;<br>
 eklausen pikr&#333;s\)</i></b>. A few old Latin documents omit this verse<br>
 which is genuine in <!-#-->Mt 26:75. It may be an insertion here from<br>
 there, but the evidence for the rejection is too slight. It is<br>
 the ingressive aorist <b><i>(\eklausen\)</i></b>, he burst into tears. "Bitter"<br>
 is a common expression for tears in all languages and in all<br>
 hearts.<br>
 <br>
 22:63 <B>{That held}</B> <b><i>(\hoi sunechontes\)</i></b>. See on &#175;8:45; 19:43 for<br>
 this verb \sunech&#333;\. Here alone in the N.T. for holding a<br>
 prisoner <b><i>(holding together)</i></b>. The servants or soldiers, not the<br>
 Sanhedrin. <B>{Mocked}</B> <b><i>(\enepaizon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, were<br>
 mocking, inchoative, began to mock, to play like boys. <B>{And beat<br>
 him}</B> <b><i>(\derontes\)</i></b>. Present active participle of \der&#333;\, to flay,<br>
 tan, or hide. Literally, "beating."<br>
 <br>
 22:64 <B>{Blindfolded}</B> <b><i>(\perikalupsantes\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 participle of \perikalupt&#333;\, old verb, to put a veil around. In<br>
 the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mr 14:65. See <!-#-->Mr 14:65; Mt 26:67f. for<br>
 further discussion.<br>
 <br>
 22:65 <B>{Many other things}</B> <b><i>(\hetera polla\)</i></b>. These are just<br>
 samples.<br>
 <br>
 22:66 <B>{As soon as it was day}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s egeneto h&#275;mera\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr 15:1<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:1)</i></b> has "morning." <B>{The assembly of the people}</B> <b><i>(\to<br>
 presbuterion tou laou\)</i></b>. The technical word for "the eldership"<br>
 <b><i>(from \presbuteros\, an old man or elder)</i></b> or group of the elders<br>
 composing the Sanhedrin. The word occurs in the LXX for the<br>
 Sanhedrin. In the N.T. occurs only here and <!-#-->Ac 22:5 of the<br>
 Sanhedrin. In <!-#-->1Ti 4:14 Paul uses it of the elders in a church<br>
 <b><i>(or churches)</i></b>. The Sanhedrin was composed of the elders and<br>
 scribes and chief priests <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 15:1)</i></b> and all three groups are at<br>
 this meeting. Luke's language <b><i>(both chief priests and scribes,<br>
 \te ... kai\)</i></b> seems to apply the word \presbuterion\ to the whole<br>
 Sanhedrin. Sadducees <b><i>(chief priests)</i></b> and Pharisees <b><i>(scribes)</i></b> were<br>
 nearly equally represented. <B>{Into their council}</B> <b><i>(\eis to<br>
 sunedrion aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. The place of the gathering is not given, but<br>
 Jesus was led into the council chamber.<br>
 <br>
 22:67 <B>{If thou art the Christ}</B> <b><i>(\Ei su ei ho Christos\)</i></b>. The<br>
 Messiah, they mean. The condition is the first class, assuming it<br>
 to be true. <B>{If I tell you}</B> <b><i>(\Ean humin eip&#333;\)</i></b>. Condition of the<br>
 third class, undetermined, but with likelihood of being<br>
 determined. This is the second appearance of Jesus before the<br>
 Sanhedrin merely mentioned by <!-#-->Mr 15:1; Mt 27:1 who give in<br>
 detail the first appearance and trial. Luke merely gives this<br>
 so-called ratification meeting after daybreak to give the<br>
 appearance of legality to their vote of condemnation already<br>
 taken <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:64; Mt 26:66)</i></b>. <B>{Ye will not believe}</B> <b><i>(\ou m&#275;<br>
 pisteus&#275;te\)</i></b>. Double negative with the aorist subjunctive,<br>
 strongest possible negative. So as to verse <!-#-->68.<br>
 <br>
 22:69 <B>{The Son of man}</B> <b><i>(\ho huios tou anthr&#333;pou\)</i></b>. Jesus really<br>
 answers their demand about "the Messiah" by asserting that he is<br>
 "the Son of man" and they so understand him. He makes claims of<br>
 equality with God also which they take up.<br>
 <br>
 22:70 <B>{Art thou the Son of God?}</B> <b><i>(\Su oun ei ho huios tou<br>
 theou;\)</i></b>. Note how these three epithets are used as practical<br>
 equivalents. They ask about "the Messiah." Jesus affirms that he<br>
 is the Son of Man and will sit at the right hand of the power of<br>
 God. They take this to be a claim to be the Son of God <b><i>(both<br>
 humanity and deity)</i></b>. Jesus accepts the challenge and admits that<br>
 he claims to be all three <b><i>(Messiah, the Son of man, the Son of<br>
 God)</i></b>. <B>{Ye say}</B> <b><i>(\Humeis legete\)</i></b>. Just a Greek idiom for "Yes"<br>
 <b><i>(compare "I am" in <!-#-->Mr 14:62 with "Thou has said" in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 26:64)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 22:71 <B>{For we ourselves have heard}</B> <b><i>(\autoi gar &#275;kousamen\)</i></b>. They<br>
 were right if Jesus is not what he claimed to be. They were<br>
 eternally wrong for he is the Christ, the Son of man, the Son of<br>
 God. They made their choice and must face Christ as Judge.<br>
