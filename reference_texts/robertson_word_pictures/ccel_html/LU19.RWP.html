 <HR>
<p>19:1 <B>{Was passing through}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;rcheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle. Now<br>
 Jesus was inside the Roman Jericho with the procession.<br>
 <br>
 19:2 <B>{Chief publican}</B> <b><i>(\architel&#333;n&#275;s\)</i></b>. The word occurs nowhere<br>
 else apparently but the meaning is clear from the other words<br>
 with \archi-\ like \archiereus\ <b><i>(chief priest)</i></b> \archipoim&#275;n\<br>
 <b><i>(chief shepherd)</i></b>. Jericho was an important trading point for<br>
 balsam and other things and so Zacchaeus was the head of the tax<br>
 collections in this region, a sort of commissioner of taxes who<br>
 probably had other publicans serving under him.<br>
 <br>
 19:3 <B>{He sought}</B> <b><i>(\ez&#275;tei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. He was seeking,<br>
 conative idea. <B>{Jesus who he was}</B> <b><i>(\I&#275;soun tis estin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Prolepsis, to see who Jesus was. He had heard so much about him.<br>
 He wanted to see which one of the crowd was Jesus. <B>{For the<br>
 crowd}</B> <b><i>(\apo tou ochlou\)</i></b>. He was short and the crowd was thick<br>
 and close. <B>{Stature}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i h&#275;liki&#257;i\)</i></b>. No doubt of that meaning<br>
 here and possibly so in <!-#-->2:52. Elsewhere "age" except <!-#-->Lu 12:25;<br>
 Mt 6:27 where it is probably "stature" also.<br>
 <br>
 19:4 <B>{Ran on before}</B> <b><i>(\prodram&#333;n eis to emprosthen\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active participle of \protrech&#333;\ <b><i>(defective verb)</i></b>.<br>
 "Before" occurs twice <b><i>(\pro-\ and \eis to emprosthen\)</i></b>. <B>{Into a<br>
 sycamore tree}</B> <b><i>(\epi sukomorean\)</i></b>. From \sukon\, fig, and<br>
 \moron\, mulberry. The fig-mulberry and quite a different tree<br>
 from the sycamine tree in <!-#-->17:6, which see. It bore a poor fruit<br>
 which poor people ate <b><i>(<!-#-->Am 7:14)</i></b>. It was a wide open tree with<br>
 low branches so that Zacchaeus could easily climb into it. <B>{That<br>
 way}</B> <b><i>(\ekein&#275;s\)</i></b>. Feminine for \hodos\ <b><i>(way)</i></b> is understood.<br>
 Genitive case with \di\ in composition <b><i>(\dierchesthai\)</i></b> or as an<br>
 adverbial use.<br>
 <br>
 19:5 <B>{Make haste and come down}</B> <b><i>(\speusas katab&#275;thi\)</i></b>.<br>
 Simultaneous aorist active participle <b><i>(\speusas\)</i></b> with the second<br>
 aorist active imperative. "Come down in a hurry."<br>
 <br>
 19:6 <B>{He made haste and came down}</B> <b><i>(\speusas kateb&#275;\)</i></b>. Luke<br>
 repeats the very words of Jesus with the same idiom. <B>{Received<br>
 him joyfully}</B> <b><i>(\hupedexato auton chair&#333;n\)</i></b>. The very verb used of<br>
 Martha's welcome to Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->10:38)</i></b>. "Joyfully" is the present<br>
 active participle, "rejoicing" <b><i>(\chair&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 19:7 <B>{Murmured}</B> <b><i>(\diegogguzonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of this<br>
 compound onomatopoetic word \dia-gogguz&#333;\. In <!-#-->Lu 5:30 we have<br>
 the simple \gogguz&#333;\, a late word like the cooing doves or the<br>
 hum of bees. This compound with \dia-\ is still rarer, but more<br>
 expressive. <B>{To lodge}</B> <b><i>(\katalusai\)</i></b>. Jesus was the hero of this<br>
 crowd from Galilee on their way to the passover. But here he had<br>
 shocked their sensibilities and those of the people of Jericho by<br>
 inviting himself to be the guest of this chief publican and<br>
 notorious sinner who had robbed nearly everybody in the city by<br>
 exorbitant taxes.<br>
 <br>
 19:8 <B>{Stood}</B> <b><i>(\statheis\)</i></b>. Apparently Jesus and Zacchaeus had<br>
 come to the house of Zacchaeus and were about to enter when the<br>
 murmur became such a roar that Zacchaeus turned round and faced<br>
 the crowd. <B>{If I have wrongfully exacted aught of any man}</B> <b><i>(\ei<br>
 tinos ti esukophant&#275;sa\)</i></b>. A most significant admission and<br>
 confession. It is a condition of the first class <b><i>(\ei\ and the<br>
 aorist active indicative)</i></b> that assumes it to be true. His own<br>
 conscience was at work. He may have heard audible murmurs from<br>
 the crowd. For the verb \sukophantein\, see discussion on &#175;3:14,<br>
 the only two instances in the N.T. He had extorted money<br>
 wrongfully as they all knew. <B>{I return fourfold}</B> <b><i>(\apodid&#333;mi<br>
 tetraploun\)</i></b>. I offer to do it here and now on this spot. This<br>
 was the Mosaic law <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 22:1; Nu 5:6f.)</i></b>. Restitution is good<br>
 proof of a change of heart. D. L. Moody used to preach it with<br>
 great power. Without this the offer of Zacchaeus to give half his<br>
 goods to the poor would be less effective. "It is an odd<br>
 coincidence, nothing more, that the fig-mulberry <b><i>(sycamore)</i></b><br>
 should occur in connexion with the _fig_-shewer <b><i>(sycophant)</i></b>."<br>
 <br>
 19:10 <B>{The lost}</B> <b><i>(\to apol&#333;los\)</i></b>. The neuter as a collective<br>
 whole, second perfect active participle of \apollumi\, to<br>
 destroy. See <!-#-->Lu 15 for the idea of the lost.<br>
 <br>
 19:11 <B>{He added and spake}</B> <b><i>(\prostheis eipen\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active participle of \prostith&#275;mi\ with \eipen\. It is a Hebrew<br>
 idiom seen also in <!-#-->Lu 20:1f. he added to send <b><i>(\prosetheto<br>
 pempsai\)</i></b> and in <!-#-->Ac 12:3 "he added to seize" <b><i>(\prosetheto<br>
 sullabein\)</i></b>. This undoubted Hebraism occurs in the N.T. in Luke<br>
 only, probably due to the influence of the LXX on Luke the Greek<br>
 Christian. <B>{To appear}</B> <b><i>(\anaphainesthai\)</i></b>. Present passive<br>
 infinitive of an old verb to be made manifest, to be shown up. In<br>
 the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ac 21:3.<br>
 <br>
 19:12 <B>{To take to himself a kingdom}</B> <b><i>(\labein heaut&#333;i<br>
 basileian\)</i></b>. Second aorist active infinitive of \lamban&#333;\ with<br>
 the dative reflexive \heaut&#333;i\ where the middle voice could have<br>
 been used. Apparently this parable has the historical basis of<br>
 Archelaus who actually went from Jerusalem to Rome on this very<br>
 errand to get a kingdom in Palestine and to come back to it. This<br>
 happened while Jesus was a boy in Nazareth and it was a matter of<br>
 common knowledge.<br>
 <br>
 19:13 <B>{Trade ye herewith till I come}</B> <b><i>(\pragmateusasthe en h&#333;i<br>
 erchomai\)</i></b>. First aorist middle imperative of \pragmateuomai\, an<br>
 old verb from \pr&#257;gma\, business. Here only in the N.T. Westcott<br>
 and Hort in their text read \pragmateusasthai\, first aorist<br>
 middle infinitive <b><i>(\-ai\ and \-e\ were pronounced alike)</i></b>. The<br>
 infinitive makes it indirect discourse, the imperative direct.<br>
 <B>{While I am coming}</B> is what \en h&#333;i erchomai\ really means.<br>
 <br>
 19:14 <B>{His citizens}</B> <b><i>(\hoi politai autou\)</i></b>. That actually<br>
 happened with Archelaus.<br>
 <br>
 19:15 <B>{When he was come back again}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i epanelthein auton\)</i></b>.<br>
 "On the coming back again as to him." Luke's favourite idiom of<br>
 the articular infinitive after \en\ and with the accusative of<br>
 general reference. <B>{Had given}</B> <b><i>(\ded&#333;kei\)</i></b>. Past perfect active<br>
 indicative without augment of \did&#333;mi\. <B>{That he might know}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hina gnoi\)</i></b>. Second aorist active subjunctive of \ginosk&#333;\. The<br>
 optative would be \gnoi&#275;\.<br>
 <br>
 19:16 <B>{Hath made}</B> <b><i>(\pros&#275;rgasato\)</i></b>. Only here in the N.T. Note<br>
 \pros-\ in addition, besides, more.<br>
 <br>
 19:17 <B>{Have thou authority}</B> <b><i>(\isthi exousian ech&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic present active imperative. Keep on having authority.<br>
 <br>
 19:19 <B>{Be thou also over}</B> <b><i>(\kai su epano ginou\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 imperative. Keep on becoming over. There is no real reason for<br>
 identifying this parable of the pounds with the parable of the<br>
 talents in <!-#-->Mt 25. The versatility of Jesus needs to be<br>
 remembered by those who seek to flatten out everything.<br>
 <br>
 19:20 <B>{I kept}</B> <b><i>(\eichon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \ech&#333;\. I kept on<br>
 keeping. <B>{Laid up}</B> <b><i>(\apokeimen&#275;n\)</i></b>. Present passive participle<br>
 agreeing with \h&#275;n\ <b><i>(which)</i></b>, used often as perfect passive of<br>
 \tith&#275;mi\ as here, laid away or off <b><i>(\apo\)</i></b>. It is not the<br>
 periphrastic construction, but two separate verbs, each with its<br>
 own force. <B>{In a napkin}</B> <b><i>(\en soudari&#333;i\)</i></b>. A Latin word<br>
 _sudarium_ from _sudor_ <b><i>(sweat)</i></b> transliterated into Greek, a<br>
 sweatcloth handkerchief or napkin. Found in papyrus marriage<br>
 contracts as part of the dowry <b><i>(second and third centuries A.D.,<br>
 Deissmann, _Bible Studies_, p. 223)</i></b>. Used also for swathing the<br>
 head of the dead <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 11:44; 20:7)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 19:21 <B>{I feared}</B> <b><i>(\ephoboum&#275;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, I continued to<br>
 fear. <B>{Austere}</B> <b><i>(\aust&#275;ros\)</i></b>. Old Greek word from \au&#333;\, to dry<br>
 up. Reproduced in Latin _austeros_ and English _austere_. It<br>
 means rough to the taste, stringent. Here only in the N.T.<br>
 Compare \skl&#275;ros\ <b><i>(hard)</i></b> in <!-#-->Mt 25:24. "Harsh in flavour, then<br>
 in disposition" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. <B>{Thou layedst not down}</B> <b><i>(\ouk eth&#275;kas\)</i></b>.<br>
 Probably a proverb for a grasping profiteer.<br>
 <br>
 19:22 <B>{Thou knewest}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;ideis\)</i></b>. Second past perfect of \hora&#333;\,<br>
 to see, used as imperfect of \oida\, to know. Either it must be<br>
 taken as a question as Westcott and Hort do or be understood as<br>
 sarcasm as the Revised Version has it. The words of the wicked<br>
 <b><i>(\pon&#275;ros\)</i></b> slave are turned to his own condemnation.<br>
 <br>
 19:23 <B>{Then wherefore}</B> <b><i>(\kai dia ti\)</i></b>. Note this inferential use<br>
 of \kai-\ in that case. <B>{Into the bank}</B> <b><i>(\epi trapezan\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, <B>{upon a table}</B>. This old word \trapeza\, from<br>
 \tetrapeza\ <b><i>(\tetra\, four, \pous\, foot)</i></b>. It means then any<br>
 table <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 7:28)</i></b>, food on the table <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 16:34)</i></b>, feast or<br>
 banquet <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 11:9)</i></b>, table of the money-changers <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 2:15; Mr<br>
 11:15; Mt 21:12)</i></b>, or bank as here. Our word bank is from Old<br>
 English _bench_. <B>{With interest}</B> <b><i>(\sun tok&#333;i\)</i></b>. Not usury, but<br>
 proper and legal interest. Old word from \tikt&#333;\, to bring forth.<br>
 In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mt 25:27. <B>{Should have required it}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\an auto epraxa\)</i></b>. Conclusion of second-class condition the<br>
 condition or apodosis being implied in the participle "coming"<br>
 <b><i>(\elth&#333;n\)</i></b>, and the previous question. On this technical use of<br>
 \prass&#333;\ <b><i>(\epraxa\)</i></b> see <!-#-->Lu 3:13.<br>
 <br>
 19:25 <B>{And they said unto him}</B> <b><i>(\kai eipan aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Probably the<br>
 eager audience who had been listening to this wonderful parable<br>
 interrupted Jesus at this point because of this sudden turn when<br>
 the one pound is given to the man who has ten pounds. If so, it<br>
 shows plainly how keenly they followed the story which Jesus was<br>
 giving because of their excitement about the kingdom <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 19:11)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 19:26 <B>{That hath not}</B> <b><i>(\tou m&#275; echontos\)</i></b>. The present tense of<br>
 \ech&#333;\ here, that keeps on not having, probably approaches the<br>
 idea of acquiring or getting, the one who keeps on not acquiring.<br>
 This is the law of nature and of grace.<br>
 <br>
 19:27 <B>{Reign}</B> <b><i>(\basileusai\)</i></b>. First aorist active infinitive,<br>
 ingressive aorist, come to rule. <B>{Slay}</B> <b><i>(\katasphaxate\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active imperative of \katasphaz&#333;\, to slaughter, an old<br>
 verb, but only here in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 19:28 <B>{Went on before}</B> <b><i>(\eporeueto emprosthen\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 middle. Jesus left the parable to do its work and slowly went on<br>
 his way up the hill to Jerusalem.<br>
 <br>
 19:29 <B>{Unto Bethphage and Bethany}</B> <b><i>(\eis B&#275;thphag&#275; kai<br>
 B&#275;thania\)</i></b>. Both indeclinable forms of the Hebrew or Aramaic<br>
 names. In <!-#-->Mr 11:1 "Bethany" is inflected regularly, which see.<br>
 <B>{Of Olives}</B> <b><i>(\Elai&#333;n\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->Mr 11:1; Mt 21:1, though some<br>
 editors take it to be, not the genitive plural of \elaia\ <b><i>(olive<br>
 tree)</i></b>, but the name of the place Olivet. In the Greek it is just<br>
 a matter of accent <b><i>(circumflex or acute)</i></b> Olivet is correct in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 1:12. See on &#175;Mt 21:1ff.; Mr 11:1ff. for details.<br>
 <br>
 19:30 <B>{Whereon no man ever yet sat}</B> <b><i>(\eph' hon oudeis p&#333;pote<br>
 anthr&#333;p&#333;n ekathisen\)</i></b>. Plummer holds that this fact indicated to<br>
 the disciples a royal progress into the city of a piece with the<br>
 Virgin Birth of Jesus and the burial in a new tomb.<br>
 <br>
 19:32 <B>{As he had said unto them}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s eipen autois\)</i></b>. Luke<br>
 alone notes this item.<br>
 <br>
 19:33 <B>{As they were loosing}</B> <b><i>(\luont&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute. <B>{The owners thereof}</B> <b><i>(\hoi kurioi autou\)</i></b>. The same<br>
 word \kurios\ used of the Lord Jesus in verse <!-#-->31 <b><i>(and <!-#-->34)</i></b> and<br>
 which these "owners" would understand. See on &#175;Mt 21:3; Mr 11:3<br>
 for \kurios\ used by Jesus about himself with the expectation<br>
 that these disciples would recognize him by that title as they<br>
 did. The word in common use for the Roman emperor and in the LXX<br>
 to translate the Hebrew _Elohim_ <b><i>(God)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 19:35 <B>{Set Jesus thereon}</B> <b><i>(\epebibasan ton I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active. Old verb, to cause to mount, causative verb from \bain&#333;\,<br>
 to go. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 10:34; Ac 23:24.<br>
 <br>
 19:36 <B>{They spread}</B> <b><i>(\hupestr&#333;nnuon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active<br>
 describing the continued spreading as they went on.<br>
 \Hupostr&#333;nnu&#333;\ is a late form of the old verb \hupostorennumi\.<br>
 Here only in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 19:37 <B>{At the descent}</B> <b><i>(\pros t&#275;i katabasei\)</i></b>. Epexegetic of<br>
 "drawing nigh." They were going by the southern slope of the<br>
 Mount of Olives. As they turned down to the city, the grand view<br>
 stirred the crowd to rapturous enthusiasm. This was the first<br>
 sight of the city on this route which is soon obscured in the<br>
 descent. The second view bursts out again <b><i>(verse <!-#-->41)</i></b>. It was a<br>
 shout of triumph from the multitude with their long pent-up<br>
 enthusiasm <b><i>(verse <!-#-->11)</i></b>, restrained no longer by the parable of<br>
 the pounds. <B>{For all the mighty works which they had seen}</B> <b><i>(\peri<br>
 pas&#333;n eidon duname&#333;n\)</i></b>. Neat Greek idiom, incorporation of the<br>
 antecedent <b><i>(\duname&#333;n\)</i></b> into the relative clause and attraction<br>
 of the case of the relative from the accusative \has\ to the<br>
 genitive \h&#333;n\. And note "all." The climax had come, Lazarus,<br>
 Bartimaeus, and the rest.<br>
 <br>
 19:38 <B>{The king cometh}</B> <b><i>(\ho erchomenos, ho basileus\)</i></b>. The<br>
 Messianic hopes of the people were now all ablaze with<br>
 expectation of immediate realization. A year ago in Galilee he<br>
 had frustrated their plans for a revolutionary movement "to take<br>
 him by force to make him king" <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:15)</i></b>. The phrase "the<br>
 coming king" like "the coming prophet" <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:14; De 18:15)</i></b><br>
 expressed the hope of the long-looked-for Messiah. They are<br>
 singing from the Hallel in their joy that Jesus at last is making<br>
 public proclamation of his Messiahship. <B>{Peace in heaven, and<br>
 glory in the highest}</B> <b><i>(\en ouran&#333;i eir&#275;n&#275; kai doxa en<br>
 hupsistois\)</i></b>. This language reminds one strongly of the song of<br>
 the angels at the birth of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:14)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr 11:10; Mt 21:9<br>
 have "Hosannah in the highest."<br>
 <br>
 19:39 <B>{Some of the Pharisees}</B> <b><i>(\tines t&#333;n Pharisai&#333;n\)</i></b>. Luke<br>
 seems to imply by "from the multitude" <b><i>(\apo tou ochlou\)</i></b> that<br>
 these Pharisees were in the procession, perhaps half-hearted<br>
 followers of the mob. But <!-#-->Joh 12:19 speaks of Pharisees who<br>
 stood off from the procession and blamed each other for their<br>
 failure and the triumph of Jesus. These may represent the bolder<br>
 spirits of their same group who dared to demand of Jesus that he<br>
 rebuke his disciples.<br>
 <br>
 19:40 <B>{If these shall hold their peace}</B> <b><i>(\ean houtoi<br>
 si&#333;p&#275;sousin\)</i></b>. A condition of the first class, determined as<br>
 fulfilled. The use of \ean\ rather than \ei\ cuts no figure in<br>
 the case <b><i>(see <!-#-->Ac 8:31; 1Th 3:8; 1Jo 5:15)</i></b>. The kind of<br>
 condition is determined by the mode which is here indicative. The<br>
 future tense by its very nature does approximate the aorist<br>
 subjunctive, but after all it is the indicative. <B>{The stones will<br>
 cry out}</B> <b><i>(\hoi lithoi kraxousin\)</i></b>. A proverb for the impossible<br>
 happening.<br>
 <br>
 19:41 <B>{Wept}</B> <b><i>(\eklausen\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist active indicative,<br>
 burst into tears. Probably audible weeping.<br>
 <br>
 19:42 <B>{If thou hadst known}</B> <b><i>(\ei egn&#333;s\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\. Second-class condition, determined as<br>
 unfulfilled. <B>{Even thou}</B> <b><i>(\kai su\)</i></b>. Emphatic position of the<br>
 subject. <B>{But now}</B> <b><i>(\nun de\)</i></b>. Aposiopesis. The conclusion is not<br>
 expressed and the sudden breaking off and change of structure is<br>
 most impressive. <B>{They are hid}</B> <b><i>(\ekrub&#275;\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive<br>
 indicative of \krupt&#333;\, common verb, to hide.<br>
 <br>
 19:43 <B>{Shall cast up a bank}</B> <b><i>(\parembalousin charaka\)</i></b>. Future<br>
 active indicative of \paremball&#333;\, a double compound <b><i>(\para, en,<br>
 ball&#333;\)</i></b> of long usage, finally in a military sense of line of<br>
 battle or in camp. Here alone in the N.T. So also the word<br>
 \charaka\ <b><i>(\charax\)</i></b> for bank, stake, palisade, rampart, is here<br>
 alone in the N.T., though common enough in the old Greek.<br>
 <B>{Compass thee round}</B> <b><i>(\perikukl&#333;sousin se\)</i></b>. Future active<br>
 indicative. Another common compound to make a circle <b><i>(\kuklos\)</i></b><br>
 around <b><i>(\peri\)</i></b>, though here only in the N.T. <B>{Keep thee in}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sunexousin se\)</i></b>. Shall hold thee together on every side<br>
 <b><i>(\pantothen\)</i></b>. See about \sunech&#333;\ on <!-#-->4:38.<br>
 <br>
 19:44 <B>{Shall dash to the ground}</B> <b><i>(\edaphiousin\)</i></b>. Attic future of<br>
 \edaphiz&#333;\, to beat level, to raze to the ground, a rare verb<br>
 from \edaphos\, bottom, base, ground <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 22:7)</i></b>, here alone in<br>
 the N.T. <B>{Because}</B> <b><i>(\anth' h&#333;n\)</i></b>. "In return for which things."<br>
 <B>{Thou knewest not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk egn&#333;s\)</i></b>. Applying the very words of the<br>
 lament in the condition in verse <!-#-->42. This vivid prophecy of the<br>
 destruction of Jerusalem is used by those who deny predictive<br>
 prophecy even for Jesus as proof that Luke wrote the Gospel after<br>
 the destruction of Jerusalem. But it is no proof at all to those<br>
 who concede to Jesus adequate knowledge of his mission and<br>
 claims.<br>
 <br>
 19:45 <B>{Began to cast out}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rxato ekballein\)</i></b>. So <!-#-->Mr 11:15<br>
 whereas <!-#-->Mt 21:12 has simply "he cast out." See Mark and Matthew<br>
 for discussion of this second cleansing of the temple at the<br>
 close of the public ministry in relation to the one at the<br>
 beginning in <!-#-->Joh 2:14-22. There is nothing gained by accusing<br>
 John or the Synoptics of a gross chronological blunder. There was<br>
 abundant time in these three years for all the abuses to be<br>
 revived.<br>
 <br>
 19:47 <B>{He was teaching}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n didask&#333;n\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect.<br>
 <B>{Daily}</B> <b><i>(\to kath' h&#275;meran\)</i></b>. Note the accusative neuter article,<br>
 "as to the according to the day," very awkward English surely,<br>
 but perfectly good Greek. The same idiom occurs in <!-#-->11:3.<br>
 <B>{Sought}</B> <b><i>(\ez&#275;toun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, conative imperfect, were<br>
 seeking, trying to seek. <B>{The principal men of the people}</B> <b><i>(\hoi<br>
 pr&#333;toi tou laou\)</i></b>. The first men of the people. The position<br>
 after the verb and apart from the chief priests and the scribes<br>
 calls special attention to them. Some of these "first men" were<br>
 chief priests or scribes, but not all of them. The lights and<br>
 leaders of Jerusalem were bent on the destruction <b><i>(\apolesai\)</i></b> of<br>
 Jesus. The raising of Lazarus from the dead brought them together<br>
 for this action <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 11:47-53; 12:9-11)</i></b>.<br>

 19:48 <B>{They could not find}</B> <b><i>(\ouch h&#275;uriskon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active.<br>
 They kept on not finding. <B>{What they might do}</B> <b><i>(\to ti<br>
 poi&#275;s&#333;sin\)</i></b>. First aorist active deliberative subjunctive in a<br>
 direct question retained in the indirect. Note the article \to\<br>
 <b><i>(neuter accusative)</i></b> with the question. <B>{Hung upon him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\exekremeto autou\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of \ekkremamai\, an old<br>
 verb <b><i>(\mi\ form)</i></b> to hang from, here only in the N.T. The form is<br>
 an \omega\ form from \ekkremomai\, a constant tendency to the<br>
 \omega\ form in the _Koin&#275;_. It pictures the whole nation <b><i>(save<br>
 the leaders in verse <!-#-->47)</i></b> hanging upon the words of Jesus as if<br>
 in suspense in mid-air, rapt attention that angered these same<br>
 leaders. Tyndale renders it "stuck by him."<br>
