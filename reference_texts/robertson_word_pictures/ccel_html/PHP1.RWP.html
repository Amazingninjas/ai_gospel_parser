 Word Pictures in the New Testament<I><br>(Philippians: Chapter 1)</I>

</TD></TR></TABLE>
 <HR>
<p>1:1 <B>{Paul}</B> <b><i>(\Paulos\)</i></b>. He does not mention his apostleship as he<br>
 usually does. Omitted also in I and II Thess. and Philemon.<br>
 <B>{Timothy}</B> <b><i>(\Timotheos\)</i></b>. In no sense the author, but associated<br>
 with Paul because with him here in Rome as in Corinth when I and<br>
 II Thessalonians written and in Ephesus when I Corinthians sent<br>
 and in Macedonia when II Corinthians written. Timothy was with<br>
 Paul when the Philippian church was founded <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 16:1,13;<br>
 17:14)</i></b>. He had been there twice since <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 19:22; 20:3f.)</i></b>. <B>{To<br>
 all the saints}</B> <b><i>(\p&#257;si tois hagiois\)</i></b>. The word saint <b><i>(\hagios\)</i></b><br>
 here is used for the professing Christians as in <!-#-->1Co 1:2 which<br>
 see as well as <!-#-->Ro 1:7 for the origin of the word. The word<br>
 "all" <b><i>(\p&#257;si\)</i></b> means that all individual believers are included.<br>
 Paul employs this word frequently in Philippians. <B>{In Christ<br>
 Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\en Christ&#333;i I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. The centre for all Christian<br>
 relations and activities for Paul and for us. <B>{In Philippi}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 Philippois\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Ac 16:12 for discussion of this name.<br>
 <B>{With the bishops}</B> <b><i>(\sun episkopois\)</i></b>. "Together with bishops,"<br>
 thus singled out from "all the saints." See <!-#-->Ac 20:17,28 for the<br>
 use of this most interesting word as equivalent to \presbuteros\<br>
 <b><i>(elder)</i></b>. It is an old word from \episkeptomai\, to look upon or<br>
 after, to inspect, so the overseer or superintendent. In the<br>
 second century \episcopos\ <b><i>(Ignatius)</i></b> came to mean one superior<br>
 to elders, but not so in the N.T. The two New Testament church<br>
 officers are here mentioned <b><i>(bishops or elders and deacons)</i></b>. The<br>
 plural is here employed because there was usually one church in a<br>
 city with several pastors <b><i>(bishops, elders)</i></b>. <B>{And deacons}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 diakonois\)</i></b>. Technical sense here of the other church officers as<br>
 in <!-#-->1Ti 3:8-13, not the general use as in <!-#-->Mt 22:13. The origin<br>
 of the office is probably seen in <!-#-->Ac 6:1-6. The term is often<br>
 applied to preachers <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 3:5; 2Co 3:6)</i></b>. The etymology <b><i>(\dia,<br>
 konis\)</i></b> suggests raising a dust by hastening.<br>
 <br>
 1:3 <B>{Upon}</B> <b><i>(\epi\)</i></b>. Basis of the thanksgiving. <B>{All}</B> <b><i>(\p&#257;s&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Note frequent use of "all" here <b><i>(\p&#257;s&#275;i, pantote\, always,<br>
 \p&#257;s&#275;i\, again, \pant&#333;n hum&#333;n\, you all)</i></b>. The use of "you all"<br>
 recurs several times <b><i>(<!-#-->4,7 _bis_, <!-#-->8)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:4 <B>{With joy}</B> <b><i>(\meta charas\)</i></b>. Keynote of the Epistle. Paul is a<br>
 happy prisoner as in Philippi when he and Silas sang praises at<br>
 midnight though in prison <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 16:25)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:5 <B>{For your fellowship}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;i koin&#333;ni&#257;i hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. "On the<br>
 basis of your contribution" as in <!-#-->2Co 8:4; 9:13; Ac 2:42. The<br>
 particular kind of "partnership" or "fellowship" involved is the<br>
 contribution made by the Philippians for the spread of the gospel<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1:7 \sugkoin&#333;nous\ and <!-#-->4:14 where \sugkoin&#333;n&#275;santes\<br>
 occurs)</i></b>. <B>{In furtherance of the gospel}</B> <b><i>(\eis to euaggelion\)</i></b>.<br>
 "For the gospel." <B>{From the first day until now}</B> <b><i>(\apo t&#275;s pr&#333;t&#275;s<br>
 h&#275;meras achri tou nun\)</i></b>. As when in Thessalonica <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 4:15f.)</i></b>,<br>
 in Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:5; 2Co 11:7-10)</i></b>, and now in Rome.<br>
 <br>
 1:6 <B>{Being confident}</B> <b><i>(\pepoith&#333;s\)</i></b>. Second perfect active of<br>
 \peith&#333;\, to persuade. <B>{This very thing}</B> <b><i>(\auto touto\)</i></b>.<br>
 Accusative of the inner object with \pepoith&#333;s\, "this thing<br>
 itself." <B>{Will perfect it}</B> <b><i>(\epitelesei\)</i></b>. Future active<br>
 indicative of \epitele&#333;\, will fully <b><i>(\epi-\)</i></b> finish. God began<br>
 and God will consummate it <b><i>(see <!-#-->2Co 8:6; Ga 3:3 where both<br>
 words occur together as here)</i></b>, but not without their cooperation<br>
 and partnership. <B>{Until the day of Jesus Christ}</B> <b><i>(\achri h&#275;meras<br>
 Christou I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. The second coming as in verse <!-#-->10. See <!-#-->1Th<br>
 5:2,4; 2Th 1:10; 2:2; 1Co 1:18; 3:13; 2Co 1:14; Ro 13:12. Paul<br>
 never sets the time for the Lord's return, but he is cheered by<br>
 that blessed hope.<br>
 <br>
 1:7 <B>{Because I have you in my heart}</B> <b><i>(\dia to echein me en t&#275;i<br>
 kardi&#257;i humas\)</i></b>. Or "because you hold me in your heart."<br>
 Literally, "because of the holding me <b><i>(or you)</i></b> in the heart as to<br>
 you <b><i>(or me)</i></b>." One accusative is the object of the infinitive<br>
 \echein\, the other is the accusative of general reference. There<br>
 is no way to decide which is the idea meant except to say that<br>
 love begets love. The pastor who, like Paul, holds his people in<br>
 his heart will find them holding him in their hearts. <B>{In the<br>
 defence}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i apologi&#257;i\)</i></b>. Old word <b><i>(our word apology, but<br>
 not our idea of apologizing)</i></b>, in the original sense in <!-#-->Ac 22:1;<br>
 25:16. So also in verse <!-#-->16 below. <B>{Confirmation}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\bebai&#333;sei\)</i></b>. Old word from \bebaio&#333;\ <b><i>(\bebaios, bain&#333;\)</i></b>, to<br>
 make stable. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->Heb 6:16 about oath.<br>
 <B>{Partakers with me of grace}</B> <b><i>(\sugkoin&#333;nous mou t&#275;s charitos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "my co-sharers in grace" <b><i>(objective genitive)</i></b>. "Grace<br>
 prompted them to alleviate his imprisonment, to cooperate with<br>
 him in defending and propagating the gospel, and to suffer for<br>
 its sake" <b><i>(Vincent, _Int. Crit. Comm_.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:8 <B>{My witness}</B> <b><i>(\martus mou\)</i></b>. Same solemn oath in <!-#-->Ro 1:9. <B>{I<br>
 long after}</B> <b><i>(\epipoth&#333;\)</i></b>. Longing <b><i>(\pothos\)</i></b> directed toward<br>
 <b><i>(\epi\)</i></b> the Philippians. Old word, chiefly in Paul in N.T. <B>{In<br>
 the tender mercies}</B> <b><i>(\en splagchnois\)</i></b>. Literally "in the bowels"<br>
 as the seat of the affections.<br>
 <br>
 1:9 <B>{May abound}</B> <b><i>(\perisseu&#275;i\)</i></b>. Present active subjunctive of<br>
 \perisseu&#333;\, may keep on overflowing, a perpetual flood of love,<br>
 "yet more and more" <b><i>(\eti mallon kai mallon\)</i></b>, but with necessary<br>
 limitations <b><i>(river banks)</i></b>, "in knowledge" <b><i>(\en epign&#333;sei\, in<br>
 full knowledge)</i></b> "and all discernment" <b><i>(\p&#257;s&#275;i aisth&#275;sei\)</i></b>. The<br>
 delicate spiritual perception <b><i>(\aisth&#275;sis\, old word from<br>
 \aisthanomai\, only here in N.T. as the verb only in <!-#-->Lu 9:45 in<br>
 N.T.)</i></b> can be cultivated as in \aisth&#275;t&#275;rion\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 5:14)</i></b><br>
 <br>
 1:10 <B>{So that ye may}</B> <b><i>(\eis to humas\)</i></b>. Either purpose or result<br>
 <b><i>(\eis to\ plus infinitive as in <!-#-->Ro 1:11,20; 3:26, etc.)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Approve the things that are excellent}</B> <b><i>(\dokimazein ta<br>
 diapheronta\)</i></b>. Originally, "test the things that differ." Cf.<br>
 same idiom in <!-#-->Ro 2:28. The verb was used for assaying metals.<br>
 Either sense suits this context, but the first step is to<br>
 distinguish between good and evil and that is not always easy in<br>
 our complex civilization. <B>{Sincere}</B> <b><i>(\eilikrineis\)</i></b>. Old word of<br>
 uncertain origin from \krin&#333;\, to judge, by \heil&#275;\ <b><i>(sunlight)</i></b> or<br>
 to sift by rapid rolling <b><i>(\eilos\)</i></b>. At any rate it means pure,<br>
 unsullied. <B>{Void of offence}</B> <b><i>(\aproskopoi\)</i></b>. Alpha privative<br>
 \pros\ and \kopt&#333;\, to cut, "not stumbled against" <b><i>(not causing<br>
 others to stumble)</i></b> or if active "not stumbling against." Passive<br>
 sense probably, not active as in <!-#-->1Co 10:32. Common in the<br>
 papyri, though not in ancient Greek writers.<br>
 <br>
 1:11 <B>{Fruits of righteousness}</B> <b><i>(\karpon dikaiosun&#275;s\)</i></b>. Singular,<br>
 collective idea, fruit of righteousness. Accusative case retained<br>
 with perfect passive participle.<br>
 <br>
 1:12 <B>{The things which happened unto me}</B> <b><i>(\ta kat' eme\)</i></b>. "The<br>
 things concerning me" = "my affairs" as common in Josephus. <B>{Have<br>
 fallen out rather}</B> <b><i>(\mallon el&#275;luthen\)</i></b>. "Have come rather."<br>
 Second perfect active indicative of \erchomai\. <B>{Unto the<br>
 progress}</B> <b><i>(\eis prokop&#275;n\)</i></b>. Late word from \prokopt&#333;\, common<br>
 verb, to cut or strike forward, but this late substantive does<br>
 not occur in classical Greek. It is a technical term in Stoic<br>
 philosophy for "progress toward wisdom" and it appears also in<br>
 the papyri and the LXX. In N.T. only here, verse <!-#-->25; 1Ti 4:15.<br>
 <br>
 1:13 <B>{Throughout the whole praetorian guard}</B> <b><i>(\en hol&#333;i t&#333;i<br>
 prait&#333;ri&#333;i\)</i></b>. There were originally ten thousand of these picked<br>
 soldiers, concentrated in Rome by Tiberius. They had double pay<br>
 and special privileges and became so powerful that emperors had<br>
 to court their favour. Paul had contact with one after another of<br>
 these soldiers. It is a Latin word, but the meaning is not<br>
 certain, for in the other New Testament examples <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:27; Mr<br>
 15:16; Joh 18:28,33; 19:9; Ac 23:35)</i></b> it means the palace of the<br>
 provincial governor either in Jerusalem or Caesarea. In Rome<br>
 "palace" would have to be the emperor's palace, a possible<br>
 meaning for Paul a provincial writing to provincials <b><i>(Kennedy)</i></b>.<br>
 Some take it to mean the camp or barracks of the praetorian<br>
 guard. The Greek, "in the whole praetorium," allows this meaning,<br>
 though there is no clear example of it. Mommsen and Ramsay argue<br>
 for the judicial authorities <b><i>(_praefecti praetorio_)</i></b> with the<br>
 assessors of the imperial court. At any rate Paul, chained to a<br>
 soldier, had access to the soldiers and the officials.<br>
 <br>
 1:14 <B>{The most of the brethren}</B> <b><i>(\tous pleionas t&#333;n adelph&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 "The more part of the brethren." The comparative with the article<br>
 with the sense of the superlative as often in the _Koin&#275;_. <B>{In<br>
 the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\en Kuri&#333;i\)</i></b>. It is not clear whether this phrase is<br>
 to be connected with "brethren" or with "being confident"<br>
 <b><i>(\pepoithotas\)</i></b>, probably with \pepoithotas\. If so, then<br>
 "through my bonds" <b><i>(\tois desmois mou\)</i></b> would be the instrumental<br>
 case and mean that by means of Paul's bonds the brethren "are<br>
 more abundantly bold" <b><i>(\perissoter&#333;s tolm&#257;in\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:15 <B>{Even of envy and strife}</B> <b><i>(\kai dia phthonon kai erin\)</i></b>.<br>
 "Even because of" <b><i>(accusative after \dia\)</i></b>. Surely the lowest of<br>
 motives for preaching Christ. Envy is an old word and an old sin<br>
 and strife <b><i>(\eris\)</i></b> is more rivalry than schism. It is petty and<br>
 personal jealousy of Paul's power and prowess by the Judaizers in<br>
 Rome whom Paul has routed in the east, but who now exult at the<br>
 opportunity of annoying their great antagonist by their<br>
 interpretation of Christ. Jealousy is always against those of<br>
 one's own class or profession as preachers with preachers,<br>
 doctors with doctors. <B>{Of goodwill}</B> <b><i>(\di' eudokian\)</i></b>. Because of<br>
 goodwill toward Paul.<br>
 <br>
 1:16 <B>{Of love}</B> <b><i>(\ex agap&#275;s\)</i></b>. Out of love to Paul as well as to<br>
 Christ. Put <!-#-->1Co 13 here as a flash-light.<br>
 <br>
 1:17 <B>{Of faction}</B> <b><i>(\ex eritheias\)</i></b>. Out of partisanship. From<br>
 \eritheu&#333;\, to spin wool, and that from \erithos\, a hireling.<br>
 The papyri examples suit the idea of selfish ambition <b><i>(Moulton<br>
 and Milligan's _Vocabulary_)</i></b>. See <!-#-->2Co 12:20; Ga 5:20. <B>{Not<br>
 sincerely}</B> <b><i>(\ouch hagn&#333;s\)</i></b>. "Not purely," that is with mixed and<br>
 impure motives. <B>{To raise up affliction for my bonds}</B> <b><i>(\thlipsin<br>
 egeirein tois desmois mou\)</i></b>. Now that Paul is down they jump on<br>
 him in mean and nagging ways. Dative case in \desmois\. "To make<br>
 my chains gall me" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:18 <B>{What then?}</B> <b><i>(\ti gar?\)</i></b>. Sharp problem put up to Paul by<br>
 the conduct of the Judaizers. <B>{Only that}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;n hoti\)</i></b>. Same<br>
 idiom in <!-#-->Ac 20:23. \Pl&#275;n\ is adverb \pleon\ <b><i>(more besides)</i></b>. As<br>
 a preposition \pl&#275;n\ means "except." This essential thing Paul<br>
 sees in spite of all their envy and selfishness that Christ is<br>
 preached. <B>{Whether in pretence}</B> <b><i>(\eite prophasei\)</i></b>. Either from<br>
 \prophain&#333;\, to shew forth, or \proph&#275;mi\, to speak forth, the<br>
 ostensible presentation often untrue. See <!-#-->Ac 27:30. Paul sees<br>
 clearly through the pious pretence of these Judaizers and<br>
 rejoices that people get some knowledge of Christ. Some Christ is<br>
 better than no Christ. <B>{Yea, and will rejoice}</B> <b><i>(\alla kai<br>
 char&#275;somai\)</i></b>. Note affirmative, not adversative, use of \alla\.<br>
 Volitive use of the future <b><i>(second future passive)</i></b> indicative<br>
 <b><i>(\char&#275;somai\)</i></b> of \chair&#333;\. Paul is determined to rejoice in<br>
 spite of the efforts of the Judaizers to prod him to anger.<br>
 <br>
 1:19 <B>{Will turn}</B> <b><i>(\apob&#275;setai\)</i></b>. Future middle indicative of<br>
 \apobain&#333;\, old verb, to come from, to come back, to turn out.<br>
 <B>{To my salvation}</B> <b><i>(\eis s&#333;t&#275;rian\)</i></b>. For his release from prison<br>
 as he strongly hopes to see them again <b><i>(<!-#-->1:26)</i></b>. Lightfoot takes<br>
 the word to be Paul's eternal salvation and it must be confessed<br>
 that verse <!-#-->20 <b><i>(the close of this sentence)</i></b> does suit that idea<br>
 best. Can it be that Paul carried both conceptions in the word<br>
 here? <B>{Supply}</B> <b><i>(\epichor&#275;gias\)</i></b>. Late and rare word <b><i>(one example<br>
 in inscription of first century A.D.)</i></b>. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->Eph<br>
 4:16. From the late verb \epichor&#275;ge&#333;\ <b><i>(double compound, \epi,<br>
 choros, h&#275;geomai\, to furnish supply for the chorus)</i></b> which see in<br>
 <!-#-->2Co 9:10; Ga 3:5.<br>
 <br>
 1:20 <B>{Earnest expectation}</B> <b><i>(\apokaradokian\)</i></b>. In Paul alone from<br>
 \apokaradoke&#333;\ <b><i>(in papyri)</i></b>. See on &#175;Ro 8:19 for only other<br>
 example. <B>{Shall be magnified}</B> <b><i>(\megalunth&#275;setai\)</i></b>. Future passive<br>
 indicative of \megalun&#333;\, old verb, to make great, from \megas\<br>
 <b><i>(great)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ac 19:17. <B>{In my body}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i s&#333;mati mou\)</i></b>. See<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 12:1f. It is harder often to make Christ great in the body<br>
 than in the spirit.<br>
 <br>
 1:21 <B>{For to me}</B> <b><i>(\emoi gar\)</i></b>. Fine example of the ethical<br>
 dative. Paul gives his own view of living. <B>{To live is Christ}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\to z&#275;in Christos\)</i></b>. No copula <b><i>(\estin\)</i></b>, but \to z&#275;in\ <b><i>(the act<br>
 of living present active infinitive)</i></b> is the subject as is shown<br>
 by the article \to\. Living is coextensive with Christ. <B>{Gain}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kerdos\)</i></b>. Old word for any gain or profit, interest on money<br>
 <b><i>(so in papyri)</i></b>. In N.T. only here, <!-#-->Php 3:7; Tit 1:11. <B>{To die}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\to apothanein\, second aorist active infinitive, single act)</i></b> is<br>
 to cash in both principal and interest and so to have more of<br>
 Christ than when living. So Paul faces death with independence<br>
 and calm courage.<br>
 <br>
 1:22 <B>{If this is the fruit of my work}</B> <b><i>(\touto moi karpos<br>
 ergou\)</i></b>. There is no \ei\ <b><i>(if)</i></b> here in the Greek, but \touto\<br>
 <b><i>(this)</i></b> seems to be resumptive and to repeat the conditional<br>
 clause just before. If so, \kai\ just after means <B>{then}</B> and<br>
 introduces the conclusion of the condition. Otherwise \touto\<br>
 introduces the conclusion and \kai\ means <B>{and}</B>. <B>{I wot not}</B> <b><i>(\ou<br>
 gn&#333;riz&#333;\)</i></b>. "I know not." It seems odd to preserve the old English<br>
 word "wot" here. But it is not clear that \gn&#333;riz&#333;\ <b><i>(old<br>
 causative verb from \gin&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b> means just to know. Elsewhere in<br>
 the N.T., as in <!-#-->Lu 2:15; Ro 9:22, it means to make known, to<br>
 declare. The papyri examples mean to make known. It makes<br>
 perfectly good sense to take its usual meaning here, "I do not<br>
 declare what I shall choose."<br>
 <br>
 1:23 <B>{I am in a strait}</B> <b><i>(\sunechomai\)</i></b>. "I am held together."<br>
 Present passive indicative of the common compound verb \sunech&#333;\,<br>
 to hold together, to hem together as in <!-#-->Lu 8:45. "I am hemmed<br>
 in on both sides" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. <B>{Betwixt the two}</B> <b><i>(\ek t&#333;n duo\)</i></b>.<br>
 "From the two <b><i>(sides)</i></b>." Pressure to live on, pressure to die and<br>
 be with Christ. <B>{To depart}</B> <b><i>(\eis to analusai\)</i></b>. Purpose clause,<br>
 \eis to\ and the aorist active infinitive \analusai\, old<br>
 compound verb, to unloose <b><i>(as threads)</i></b>, to break up, to return<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 12:36, only other N.T. example)</i></b>, to break up camp<br>
 <b><i>(Polybius)</i></b>, to weigh anchor and put out to sea, to depart <b><i>(often<br>
 in old Greek and papyri)</i></b>. Cf. \katalu&#333;\ in <!-#-->2Co 5:1 for tearing<br>
 down the tent. <B>{Very far better}</B> <b><i>(\poll&#333;i mallon kreisson\)</i></b>.<br>
 Double comparative <b><i>(triple Lightfoot calls it because of<br>
 \poll&#333;i\)</i></b> like Isocrates and the _Koin&#275;_ often. See <!-#-->2Co 7:13<br>
 for \perissoter&#333;s mallon\. \Poll&#333;i\ is the instrumental case of<br>
 measure <b><i>(by much)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:24 <B>{In the flesh}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i sarki\)</i></b>. So B D G, but Aleph A C do<br>
 not have \en\. Unnecessary with \epimen&#333;\, to abide by <b><i>(common<br>
 verb)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:25 <B>{And abide with you all}</B> <b><i>(\kai paramen&#333; p&#257;sin humin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Common Pauline idiom to repeat the simple verb <b><i>(\men&#333;\)</i></b> as a<br>
 compound <b><i>(\paramen&#333;\, future active indicative)</i></b>, old verb, to<br>
 remain beside followed by locative case. See same idiom in<br>
 \chair&#333;, sunchair&#333;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 2:17)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:26 <B>{In Christ Jesus in me}</B> <b><i>(\en Christ&#333;i I&#275;sou en emoi\)</i></b>. "In<br>
 Christ Jesus" as the basis for the glorying <b><i>(\kauch&#275;ma\)</i></b>, "in me"<br>
 as the instance in point. <B>{Through my presence}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#275;s em&#275;s<br>
 parousias\)</i></b>. The word so often used of the second coming of<br>
 Christ, but here in its ordinary sense as in <!-#-->2:12; 1Co 16:17.<br>
 <br>
 1:27 <B>{Let your manner of life}</B> <b><i>(\politeuesthe\)</i></b>. Old verb from<br>
 \polit&#275;s\, citizen, and that from \polis\, city, to be a citizen,<br>
 to manage a state's affairs, to live as a citizen. Only twice in<br>
 N.T., here and <!-#-->Ac 23:1. Philippi as a colony possessed Roman<br>
 citizenship and Paul was proud of his own possession of this<br>
 right. The Authorized Version missed the figure completely by the<br>
 word "conversation" which did refer to conduct and not mere talk<br>
 as now, but did not preserve the figure of citizenship. Better<br>
 render, "Only do ye live as citizens." <B>{Striving}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sunathlountes\)</i></b>. Rather, "striving together" as in an athletic<br>
 contest. Late and rare word <b><i>(Diodorus)</i></b>. "The very energy of the<br>
 Christian faith to produce energetic individualities" <b><i>(Rainy)</i></b>.<br>
 "Striving in concert" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. <B>{For the faith}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i<br>
 pistei\)</i></b>. For the teaching of the gospel, objective sense of<br>
 \pistis\ <b><i>(faith)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:28 <B>{Affrighted}</B> <b><i>(\pturomenoi\)</i></b>. Present passive participle of<br>
 \ptur&#333;\, old verb, to frighten. The metaphor is of a timid or<br>
 scared horse and from \ptoe&#333;\ <b><i>(\ptoa\, terror)</i></b>. "Not startled in<br>
 anything." <B>{By the adversaries}</B> <b><i>(\hupo t&#333;n antikeimen&#333;n\)</i></b>. These<br>
