<p>11:1 <B>{In Judea}</B> <b><i>(\kata t&#275;n Ioudaian\)</i></b>. Throughout Judea <b><i>(probably<br>
 all Palestine)</i></b>, distributive use of \kata\. The news from<br>
 Casearea spread like wildfire among the Jewish Christians. The<br>
 case of the Samaritans was different, for they were half Jews,<br>
 though disliked. But here were real Romans even if with Jewish<br>
 affinities. <B>{Had received}</B> <b><i>(\edexanto\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 indicative. The English idiom requires "had" received, the Greek<br>
 has simply "received."<br>
 <br>
 11:2 <B>{They that were of the circumcision}</B> <b><i>(\hoi ek peritom&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, those of circumcision <b><i>(on the side of circumcision, of<br>
 the circumcision party)</i></b>. The phrase in <!-#-->10:46 is confined to the<br>
 six brethren with Peter in Caesarea <b><i>(<!-#-->11:12)</i></b>. That can hardly be<br>
 the meaning here for it would mean that they were the ones who<br>
 brought the charge against Peter though Hort takes this view. All<br>
 the disciples in Jerusalem were Jews so that it can hardly mean<br>
 the whole body. In <!-#-->Ga 2:12 the phrase has the narrower sense of<br>
 the Judaizing or Pharisaic wing of the disciples <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:5)</i></b> who<br>
 made circumcision necessary for all Gentile converts. Probably<br>
 here by anticipation Luke so describes the beginning of that<br>
 great controversy. The objectors probably did not know of Peter's<br>
 vision at Joppa, but only of the revolutionary conduct of Peter<br>
 in Caesarea. These extremists who spoke probably had abundant<br>
 sympathy in their protest. The apostles are mentioned in verse<br>
 <!-#-->1, but are not referred to in verse <!-#-->2. Apparently they are in<br>
 contrast with the circumcision party in the church. <B>{Contended}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\diekrinonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of the common verb \diakrin&#333;\,<br>
 to <B>{separate}</B>. Here to separate oneself apart <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b>, to take<br>
 sides against, to make a cleavage <b><i>(\dia\, two, in two)</i></b> as in<br>
 <!-#-->Jude 1:9. So Peter is at once put on the defensive as the<br>
 contention went on. It is plain that Peter was not regarded as<br>
 any kind of pope or overlord.<br>
 <br>
 11:3 <B>{Thou wentest in}</B> <b><i>(\eis&#275;lthes\)</i></b>. Direct form, but Westcott<br>
 and Hort have it \eis&#275;lthen\ <b><i>(he went in)</i></b>, indirect form. So with<br>
 \sunephages\ <b><i>(didst eat)</i></b> and \sunephagen\ <b><i>(did eat)</i></b>. The direct<br>
 is more vivid. <B>{Men uncircumcised}</B> <b><i>(\andras akrobustian<br>
 echontas\)</i></b>. "Men having uncircumcision." It is a contemptuous<br>
 expression. They did not object to Peter's preaching to the<br>
 Gentiles, but to his going into the house of Cornelius and eating<br>
 with them, violating his supposed obligations as a Jew <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>.<br>
 It was the same complaint in principle that the Pharisees had<br>
 made against Jesus when he ate with publicans and sinners <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 15:12)</i></b>. The Jews had not merely the Mosaic regulations about<br>
 clean and unclean food, but also the fact that at a Gentile table<br>
 some of the meat may have been an idol sacrifice. And Peter<br>
 himself had similar scruples when the vision came to him at Joppa<br>
 and when he entered the house of Cornelius in Caesarea <!-#-->10:28).<br>
 Peter had been led beyond the circumcision party.<br>
 <br>
 11:4 <B>{Began}</B> <b><i>(\arxamenos\)</i></b>. Not pleonastic here, but graphically<br>
 showing how Peter began at the beginning and gave the full story<br>
 of God's dealings with him in Joppa and Caesarea. <B>{Expounded}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\exetitheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of \ektith&#275;mi\, to set forth,<br>
 old verb, but in the N.T. only in Acts <b><i>(<!-#-->7:21; 11:4; 18:26;<br>
 28:23)</i></b>, a deliberate and detailed narrative "in order"<br>
 <b><i>(\kathex&#275;s\)</i></b>. Old word for in succession. In the N.T. only in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 1:2; 8:1; Ac 3:24; 11:14; 18:23. Luke evidently considered this<br>
 defence of Peter important and he preserves the marks of<br>
 authenticity. It came originally from Peter himself <b><i>(verses<br>
 <!-#-->5,6,15,16)</i></b>. "The case of Cornelius was a test case of primary<br>
 importance" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>, "the first great difficulty of the early<br>
 Church." Part of the story Luke gives three times <b><i>(<!-#-->10:3-6,30-32;<br>
 11:13f.)</i></b>. See the discussion chapter 10 for details given here.<br>
 <br>
 11:5 <B>{Let down}</B> <b><i>(\kathiemen&#275;n\)</i></b>. Here agreeing with the "sheet"<br>
 <b><i>(\othon&#275;n\, feminine)</i></b>, not with "vessel" <b><i>(\skeuos\, neuter)</i></b> as in<br>
 <!-#-->10:11. <B>{Even unto me}</B> <b><i>(\achri emou\)</i></b>. Vivid detail added here<br>
 by Peter.<br>
 <br>
 11:6 <B>{When I had fastened my eyes}</B> <b><i>(\atenisas\)</i></b>. This personal<br>
 touch Peter adds from his own experience. See on <!-#-->Lu 4:20; Ac<br>
 3:4,12 for this striking verb \ateniz&#333;\, to stretch the eyes<br>
 towards, first aorist active participle here. <B>{I considered}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katanoe&#333;\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \kataneo&#333;\ to put the mind down<br>
 on, to ponder, I was pondering. <B>{And saw}</B> <b><i>(\kai eidon\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active indicative, saw in a flash.<br>
 <br>
 11:7 <B>{A voice saying}</B> <b><i>(\ph&#333;n&#275;s legous&#275;s\)</i></b>. Genitive case after<br>
 \&#275;kousa\ <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->9:7 and accusative <!-#-->9:4 which see for<br>
 discussion)</i></b>. Participle \legous&#275;s\ <b><i>(present active of \leg&#333;\)</i></b><br>
 agreeing with \ph&#333;n&#275;s\, a kind of indirect discourse use of the<br>
 participle.<br>
 <br>
 11:8 <B>{Came into my mouth}</B> <b><i>(\eis&#275;lthen eis to stoma mou\)</i></b>. Instead<br>
 of \ephagon\ <b><i>(I ate)</i></b> in <!-#-->10:14. Different phrase for the same<br>
 idea.<br>
 <br>
 11:10 <B>{Was drawn up}</B> <b><i>(\anespasth&#275;\)</i></b>. Instead of \anel&#275;mpth&#275;\ <b><i>(was<br>
 taken up)</i></b> in <!-#-->10:16. First aorist passive indicative of<br>
 \anaspa&#333;\, old verb, but in N.T. only in <!-#-->Lu 14:5 and here.<br>
 <br>
 11:12 <B>{Making no distinction}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;den diakrinanta\)</i></b>. So Westcott<br>
 and Hort <b><i>(first aorist active participle)</i></b> instead of \m&#275;den<br>
 diakrinomenon\ "nothing doubting" <b><i>(present middle participle)</i></b><br>
 like <!-#-->10:20. The difference in voice shows the distinction in<br>
 meaning. <B>{We entered into the man's house}</B> <b><i>(\eis&#275;lthomen eis ton<br>
 oikon tou andros\)</i></b>. Peter confesses it, but shows that the other<br>
 six went in also. He avoids mention of Cornelius's name and<br>
 office.<br>
 <br>
 11:13 <B>{Standing and saying}</B> <b><i>(\stathenta kai eiponta\)</i></b>. More<br>
 precisely, "stand and say" <b><i>(punctiliar act, first aorist passive<br>
 and second aorist active participles)</i></b>. <B>{Fetch Simon}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\metapempsai Sim&#333;na\)</i></b>. First aorist middle imperative. Third<br>
 time mentioned <b><i>(<!-#-->10:5,22; 11:13)</i></b>. Perhaps Peter is anxious to<br>
 make it plain that he did not go of his own initiative into the<br>
 house of Cornelius. He went under God's direct orders.<br>
 <br>
 11:14 <B>{Whereby thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 hois s&#333;th&#275;s&#275;i su kai p&#257;s ho oikos sou\)</i></b>. Future passive<br>
 indicative of \s&#333;z&#333;\, to save. Clearly Cornelius was unsaved in<br>
 spite of his interest in Jewish worship. Clearly also the<br>
 household of Cornelius would likewise be won to Christ by the<br>
 words of Simon Peter. This is household conversion before the<br>
 household baptism <b><i>(<!-#-->10:48; 11:17)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:15 <B>{As I began to speak}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i arxasthai me lalein\)</i></b>. \En\<br>
 with the locative of the articular aorist infinitive \arxasthai\<br>
 <b><i>(punctiliar action simply)</i></b> and the accusative of general<br>
 reference. The second infinitive \lalein\ <b><i>(to speak)</i></b> is dependent<br>
 on \arxasthai\, "In the beginning to speak as to me." <B>{Even as on<br>
 us at the beginning}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;sper kai eph' h&#275;m&#257;s en arch&#275;i\)</i></b>. Peter<br>
 recalls vividly the events at Pentecost, the speaking with<br>
 tongues and all. It is noteworthy that Peter does not here repeat<br>
 his sermon. "He rests his defence, not on what he said, but on<br>
 what God did" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:16 <B>{I remembered}</B> <b><i>(\emn&#275;sth&#275;n\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative of the common verb \mimn&#275;sk&#333;\, to remind. Peter<br>
 recalls the very words of Jesus as reported in <!-#-->Ac 1:5. Peter<br>
 now understands this saying of Jesus as he had not done before.<br>
 That is a common experience with us all as new experiences of<br>
 grace open richer veins in God's truth <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 12:16)</i></b>. Peter<br>
 clearly sees that the water baptism is merely the symbol or<br>
 picture of the spiritual baptism in the heart.<br>
 <br>
 11:17 <B>{The like gift}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n is&#275;n d&#333;rean\)</i></b>. The equal gift, equal<br>
 in quality, rank, or measure. Common word. <B>{When we believed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pisteusasin\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle of \pisteu&#333;\ in<br>
 the dative case. It agrees both with \h&#275;min\ <b><i>(unto us)</i></b> and with<br>
 \autois\ <b><i>(unto them)</i></b>, "having believed on the Lord Jesus Christ."<br>
 Both classes <b><i>(Gentiles and Jews)</i></b> trusted in Christ, and both<br>
 received the Holy Spirit. <B>{Who was I}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; tis &#275;m&#275;n\)</i></b>. Note<br>
 order, "_I_, who was I." "<B>{That I could withstand God}</B>" <b><i>(\dunatos<br>
 k&#333;l&#8211;sai ton theon\)</i></b>. Literally, "able to withstand or hinder<br>
 God." It is a rhetorical question, really two questions. Who was<br>
 I ? Was I able to hinder God? Peter's statement of the facts made<br>
 an unanswerable defence. And yet Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 2:11)</i></b> will later in<br>
 Antioch play the coward before emissaries from Jerusalem on this<br>
 very point of eating with Gentile Christians.<br>
 <br>
 11:18 <B>{Held their peace}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;suchasan\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist active<br>
 indicative of \h&#275;suchaz&#333;\, old verb to be quiet, to keep quiet.<br>
 The wrangling <b><i>(verse <!-#-->2)</i></b> ceased. The critics even "glorified<br>
 God" <b><i>(\edoxasan\, ingressive aorist again)</i></b>. <B>{Then to the Gentiles<br>
 also}</B> <b><i>(\Ara kai tois ethnesin\)</i></b>. \Ergo\ as in <!-#-->Lu 11:20,48 and<br>
 like \ara oun\ in <!-#-->Ro 5:18. In ancient Greek inferential \ara\<br>
 cannot come at the beginning of a clause as here. It was<br>
 reluctant acquiescence in the undoubted fact that God had<br>
 "granted repentance unto life" to these Gentiles in Caesarea, but<br>
 the circumcision party undoubtedly looked on it as an exceptional<br>
 case and not to be regarded as a precedent to follow with other<br>
 Gentiles. Peter will see in this incident <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:8)</i></b> the same<br>
 principle for which Paul contends at the Jerusalem Conference.<br>
 Furneaux suggests that this conduct of Peter in Caesarea, though<br>
 grudgingly acquiesced in after his skilful defence, decreased his<br>
 influence in Jerusalem where he had been leader and helped open<br>
 the way for the leadership of James the Lord's brother.<br>
 <br>
 11:19 <B>{They therefore that were scattered abroad}</B> <b><i>(\hoi men oun<br>
 diasparentes\)</i></b>. Precisely the same words used in <!-#-->8:4 about<br>
 those scattered by Saul <b><i>(which see)</i></b> and a direct reference to it<br>
 is made by the next words, "upon the tribulation that arose about<br>
 Stephen" <b><i>(\apo t&#275;s thlipse&#333;s t&#275;s genomen&#275;s epi Stephan&#333;i\)</i></b>. As a<br>
 result of <b><i>(\apo\)</i></b>, in the case of <b><i>(\epi\)</i></b> Stephen. From that<br>
 event Luke followed Saul through his conversion and back to<br>
 Jerusalem and to Tarsus. Then he showed the activity of Peter<br>
 outside of Jerusalem as a result of the cessation of the<br>
 persecution from the conversion of Saul with the Gentile<br>
 Pentecost in Caesarea and the outcome in Jerusalem. Now Luke<br>
 starts over again from the same persecution by Saul and runs a<br>
 new line of events up to Antioch parallel to the other, probably<br>
 partly following. <B>{Except to Jews only}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275; monon<br>
 Ioudaiois\)</i></b>. Clearly these disciples did not know anything about<br>
 the events in Caesarea and at first their flight preceded that<br>
 time. But it was a wonderful episode, the eager and loyal<br>
 preaching of the fleeing disciples. The culmination in Antioch<br>
 was probably after the report of Peter about Caesarea. This<br>
 Antioch by the Orontes was founded 300 B.C. by Seleucus Nicator<br>
 and was one of five cities so named by the Seleucides. It became<br>
 the metropolis of Syria though the Arabs held Damascus first.<br>
 Antioch ranked next to Rome and Alexandria in size, wealth,<br>
 power, and vice. There were many Jews in the cosmopolitan<br>
 population of half a million. It was destined to supplant<br>
 Jerusalem as the centre of Christian activity.<br>
 <br>
 11:20 <B>{Spake}</B> <b><i>(\elaloun\)</i></b>. Inchoative imperfect active, began to<br>
 speak. For them it was an experiment. <B>{Unto the Greeks also}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai pros tous Hell&#275;nas\)</i></b>. This is undoubtedly the correct<br>
 reading in spite of Hellenists <b><i>(\Hell&#275;nistas\)</i></b> or Grecian Jews in<br>
 B E H L P. \Hell&#275;nas\ is read by A and D and a corrector of<br>
 Aleph. The presence of "also" or "even" <b><i>(\kai\)</i></b> in Aleph A B<br>
 makes no sense unless "Greeks" is correct. Hellenists or Grecian<br>
 Jews as Christians were common enough as is seen in <!-#-->Ac 2; 6.<br>
 Saul also had preached to the Hellenists in Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->9:29)</i></b>.<br>
 Hellenists were merely one kind of Jews in contrast with those<br>
 who spoke Aramaic <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 6)</i></b>. It is true that the case of Cornelius<br>
 was first in importance, but it is not clear that it was before<br>
 the work in Antioch. Probably the report of the work among the<br>
 Greeks in Antioch reached Jerusalem after Peter's defence in<br>
 <!-#-->11:1-18. That explains the calm tone about it and also why<br>
 Barnabas and not Peter was sent to investigate. Peter and John<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 8)</i></b> had condoned Philip's work in Samaria and Peter was the<br>
 agent in the work among the Romans in Caesarea. His position was<br>
 now well-known and his services discounted for this new crisis.<br>
 These Greeks in Antioch were apparently in part pure heathen and<br>
 not "God-fearers" like Cornelius. A man of wisdom was called for.<br>
 These preachers were themselves Hellenists <b><i>(verse <!-#-->19)</i></b> and open<br>
 to the lessons from their environment without a vision such as<br>
 Peter had at Joppa. "It was a departure of startling boldness"<br>
 <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b> by laymen outside of the circle of official leaders.<br>
 <br>
 11:21 <B>{The hand of the Lord was with them}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n cheir kuriou met'<br>
 aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. This O.T. phrase <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 9:3; Isa 59:1)</i></b> is used by Luke<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:66; Ac 4:28,30; 13:11)</i></b>. It was proof of God's approval of<br>
 their course in preaching the Lord Jesus to Greeks. <B>{Turned unto<br>
 the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\epestrepsen epi ton kurion\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of \epistreph&#333;\, common verb to turn. The usual<br>
 expression for Gentiles turning to the true God <b><i>(<!-#-->14:15; 15:3,19;<br>
 26:18,20; 1Th 1:9)</i></b>. Here "Lord" refers to "the Lord Jesus" as in<br>
 verse <!-#-->20, though "the hand of the Lord" is the hand of Jehovah,<br>
 clearly showing that the early disciples put Jesus on a par with<br>
 Jehovah. His deity was not a late development read back into the<br>
 early history.<br>
 <br>
 11:22 <B>{Came to the ears}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kousth&#275; eis ta &#333;ta\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive indicative of \akou&#333;\, was heard in the ears. <B>{Of the<br>
 church which was in Jerusalem}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;s ekkl&#275;sias t&#275;s en<br>
 Ierousal&#275;m\)</i></b>. Not yet was the term "church" applied to the group<br>
 of disciples in Antioch as it is in <!-#-->11:26; 13:1. <B>{They sent<br>
 forth}</B> <b><i>(\exapesteilan\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of the<br>
 double compound verb \ex-apo-stell&#333;\, to send out and away. The<br>
 choice of Barnabas was eminently wise. He already had a position<br>
 of leadership in Jerusalem because of his generosity <b><i>(<!-#-->4:36f.)</i></b><br>
 and his championship of Saul after his conversion <b><i>(<!-#-->9:27)</i></b>. He<br>
 was originally from Cyprus and probably had personal friends<br>
 among some of the leaders in this new movement. He was to<br>
 investigate the work of the travelling preachers <b><i>(verse <!-#-->19)</i></b> all<br>
 the way to Antioch <b><i>(\he&#333;s Antiocheias\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:23 <B>{The grace of God, was glad}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n charin t&#275;n tou theou<br>
 echar&#275;\)</i></b>. Note repetition of the article, "the grace that of<br>
 God." The verb <b><i>(second aorist passive indicative of \chair&#333;\)</i></b> has<br>
 the same root as \charis\. See the same _suavis paronomasia_ in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 1:28. "Grace brings gladness" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. "A smaller man would<br>
 have raised difficulties as to circumcision or baptism"<br>
 <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. <B>{He exhorted}</B> <b><i>(\parekalei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active,<br>
 picturing the continuous encouragement from Barnabas. <B>{With<br>
 purpose of heart}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i prothesei t&#275;s kardias\)</i></b>. Placing before<br>
 <b><i>(from \pro-tith&#275;mi\)</i></b>, old word for set plan as in <!-#-->Ac 27:13; Ro<br>
 8:28. The glow of the first enthusiasm might pass as often<br>
 happens after a revival. Barnabas had a special gift <b><i>(<!-#-->4:36)</i></b> for<br>
 work like this. <B>{Cleave unto the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\prosmenein [en] t&#333;i<br>
 kuri&#333;i\)</i></b>. Dative case <b><i>(locative if \en\ is genuine)</i></b> of \kurios\<br>
 <b><i>(here Jesus again)</i></b> after \prosemenein\ to keep on remaining loyal<br>
 to <b><i>(present active infinitive)</i></b>. Persistence was needed in such a<br>
 pagan city.<br>
 <br>
 11:24 <B>{For}</B> <b><i>(\hoti\)</i></b>. Because. This is the explanation of the<br>
 conduct of Barnabas. The facts were opposed to the natural<br>
 prejudices of a Jew like Barnabas, but he rose above such racial<br>
 narrowness. He was a really good man <b><i>(\agathos\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ro 5:7<br>
 for distinction between \agathos\ and \dikaios\, righteous, where<br>
 \agathos\ ranks higher than \dikaios\. Besides, Barnabas was full<br>
 of the Holy Spirit <b><i>(like Peter)</i></b> and of faith and so willing to<br>
 follow the leading of God's Spirit and take some risks. This is a<br>
 noble tribute paid by Luke. One wonders if Barnabas was still<br>
 living when he wrote this. Certainly he was not prejudiced<br>
 against Barnabas though he will follow the fortunes of Paul after<br>
 the separation <b><i>(<!-#-->15:36; 41)</i></b>. <B>{Was added unto the Lord}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\proseteth&#275; t&#333;i kuri&#333;i\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of<br>
 \prostith&#275;mi\, common verb to add to. These people were added to<br>
 the Lord Jesus before they were added to the church. If that were<br>
 always true, what a difference it would make in our churches.<br>
 <br>
 11:25 <B>{To seek for Saul}</B> <b><i>(\anaz&#275;t&#275;sai Saulon\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 <b><i>(effective)</i></b> active infinitive of purpose. \Anaz&#275;te&#333;\ is a common<br>
 verb since Plato, but in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 2:44,45, to<br>
 seek up and down <b><i>(\ana\)</i></b>, back and forth, to hunt up, to make a<br>
 thorough search till success comes. It is plain from <!-#-->Ga 1:21<br>
 that Saul had not been idle in Cilicia. Tarsus was not very far<br>
 from Antioch. Barnabas probably knew that Saul was a vessel of<br>
 choice <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 9:15)</i></b> by Christ for the work among the Gentiles. He<br>
 knew, of course, of Saul's work with the Hellenists in Jerusalem<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->9:29)</i></b> and echoes of his work in Cilicia and Syria had probably<br>
 come to him. So to Tarsus he goes when he saw the need for help.<br>
 "He had none of the littleness which cannot bear the presence of<br>
 a possible rival" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. Barnabas knew his own limitations<br>
 and knew where the man of destiny for this crisis was, the man<br>
 who already had the seal of God upon him. The hour and the man<br>
 met when Barnabas brought Saul to Antioch. The door was open and<br>
 the man was ready, far more ready than when Jesus called him on<br>
 the road to Damascus. The years in Cilicia and Syria were not<br>
 wasted for they had not been idle. If we only knew the facts, it<br>
 is probable that Saul also had been preaching to Hellenes as well<br>
 as to Hellenists. Jesus had definitely called him to work among<br>
 the Gentiles <b><i>(<!-#-->9:15)</i></b>. In his own way he had come to the same<br>
 place that Peter reached in Caesarea and that Barnabas now holds<br>
 in Antioch. God always has a man prepared for a great emergency<br>
 in the kingdom. The call of Barnabas was simply the repetition of<br>
 the call of Christ. So Saul came.<br>
 <br>
 11:26 <B>{Even for a whole year}</B> <b><i>(\kai eniauton holon\)</i></b>. Accusative<br>
 of extent of time, probably the year A.D. 44, the year preceding<br>
 the visit to Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->11:30)</i></b>, the year of the famine. The<br>
 preceding years with Tarsus as headquarters covered A.D. 37 <b><i>(39)</i></b><br>
 to 44. <B>{They were gathered together with the church}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sunachth&#275;nai en t&#275;i ekkl&#275;si&#257;i\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 infinitive of \sunag&#333;\, old verb, probably here to meet together<br>
 as in <!-#-->Mt 28:12. In <!-#-->Ac 14:27 the verb is used of gathering<br>
 together the church, but here \en t&#275;i ekkl&#275;si&#257;i\ excludes that<br>
 idea. Barnabas met together "in the church" <b><i>(note first use of<br>
 the word for the disciples at Antioch)</i></b>. This peculiar phrase<br>
 accents the leadership and co-operation of Barnabas and Saul in<br>
 teaching <b><i>(\didaxai\, first aorist active infinitive)</i></b> much people.<br>
 Both infinitives are in the nominative case, the subject of<br>
 \egeneto\ <b><i>(it came to pass)</i></b>. <B>{And that the disciples were called<br>
 Christians first in Antioch}</B> <b><i>(\chr&#275;matisai te pr&#333;t&#333;s en<br>
 Antiochei&#257;i tous math&#275;tas Christianous\)</i></b>. This first active<br>
 infinitive \chr&#275;matisai\ is also a subject of \egeneto\ and is<br>
 added as a separate item by the use of \te\ rather than \kai\.<br>
 For the word itself in the sense of divine command see on &#175;Mt<br>
 2:12,22; Lu 2:26; Ac 10:22. Here and in <!-#-->Ro 7:3 it means to be<br>
 called or named <b><i>(assuming a name from one's business, \chr&#275;ma\,<br>
 from \chraomai\, to use or to do business)</i></b>. Polybius uses it in<br>
 this sense as here. \Tous math&#275;tas\ <b><i>(the disciples)</i></b> is in the<br>
 accusative of general reference with the infinitive.<br>
 \Christianous\ <b><i>(Christians)</i></b> is simply predicate accusative. This<br>
 word is made after the pattern of \Herodianus\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 22:16,<br>
 \Her&#333;idianoi\, followers of Herod)</i></b>, \Caesarianus\, a follower of<br>
 Caesar <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient East_, p. 377, gives<br>
 papyri examples of the genitive \Kaisaros\ meaning also<br>
 "belonging to Caesar" like the common adjective \Caesarianus\)</i></b>.<br>
 It is made thus like a Latin adjective, though it is a Greek<br>
 word, and it refers to the Hebrew belief in a Messiah <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. The<br>
 name was evidently given to the followers of Christ by the<br>
 Gentiles to distinguish them from the Jews since they were<br>
 Greeks, not Grecian Jews. The Jews would not call them Christians<br>
 because of their own use of \Christos\ the Messiah. The Jews<br>
 termed them Galileans or Nazarenes. The followers of Christ<br>
 called themselves disciples <b><i>(learners)</i></b>, believers, brethren,<br>
 saints, those of the Way. The three uses of Christian in the N.T.<br>
 are from the heathen standpoint <b><i>(here)</i></b>, <!-#-->Ac 26:28 <b><i>(a term of<br>
 contempt in the mouth of Agrippa)</i></b>, and <!-#-->1Pe 4:16 <b><i>(persecution<br>
 from the Roman government)</i></b>. It is a clear distinction from both<br>
 Jews and Gentiles and it is not strange that it came into use<br>
 first here in Antioch when the large Greek church gave occasion<br>
 for it. Later Ignatius was bishop in Antioch and was given to the<br>
 lions in Rome, and John Chrysostom preached here his wonderful<br>
 sermons.<br>
 <br>
 11:27 <B>{Prophets}</B> <b><i>(\proph&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Christian prophets these were<br>
 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->13:1)</i></b> who came from Jerusalem <b><i>(the headquarters, <!-#-->8:15)</i></b>.<br>
 Judas and Silas are called prophets <b><i>(<!-#-->14:4; 15:32)</i></b>. They were<br>
 not just fore-tellers, but forth-tellers. The prophet had<br>
 inspiration and was superior to the speaker with tongues <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 14:3)</i></b>. John was a prophet <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 7:26)</i></b>. We need prophets in the<br>
 ministry today.<br>
 <br>
 11:28 <B>{Signified}</B> <b><i>(\es&#275;mainen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active in Westcott and<br>
 Hort, but aorist active \es&#275;m&#257;nen\ in the margin. The verb is an<br>
 old one from \s&#275;ma\ <b><i>(\s&#275;meion\)</i></b> a sign <b><i>(cf. the symbolic sign in<br>
 <!-#-->21:11)</i></b>. Here Agabus <b><i>(also in <!-#-->21:10)</i></b> does predict a famine<br>
 through the Holy Spirit. <B>{Should be}</B> <b><i>(\mellein esesthai\)</i></b>.<br>
 \Mell&#333;\ occurs either with the present infinitive <b><i>(<!-#-->16:27)</i></b>, the<br>
 aorist infinitive <b><i>(<!-#-->12:6)</i></b>, or the future as here and <!-#-->24:15;<br>
 27:10. <B>{Over all the world}</B> <b><i>(\eph' hol&#275;n t&#275;n oikoumen&#275;n\)</i></b>. Over<br>
 all the inhabited earth <b><i>(\g&#275;n\, understood)</i></b>. Probably a common<br>
 hyperbole for the Roman empire as in <!-#-->Lu 2:1. Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_.<br>
 VIII. 13, 4)</i></b> appears to restrict it to Palestine. <B>{In the days of<br>
 Claudius}</B> <b><i>(\epi Klaudiou\)</i></b>. He was Roman Emperor A.D. 41-44. The<br>
 Roman writers <b><i>(Suetonius, Dio Cassius, Tacitus)</i></b> all tell of<br>
 dearths <b><i>(_assiduae sterilitates_)</i></b> during the brief reign of<br>
 Claudius who was preceded by Caligula and followed by Nero.<br>
 <br>
 11:29 <B>{Every man according to his ability}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s euporeito<br>
 tis\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of \eupore&#333;\, to be well off <b><i>(from<br>
 \euporos\)</i></b>, old verb, but here alone in the N.T., "as any one was<br>
 well off." The sentence is a bit tangled in the Greek from Luke's<br>
 rush of ideas. Literally, "Of the disciples, as any one was able<br>
 <b><i>(or well off)</i></b>, they determined <b><i>(\h&#333;risan\, marked off the<br>
 horizon)</i></b> each of them to send relief <b><i>(\eis diakonian\, for<br>
 ministry)</i></b> to the brethren who dwelt in Judaea." The worst of the<br>
 famine came A.D. 45. The warning by Agabus stirred the brethren<br>
 in Antioch to send the collection on ahead.<br>
 <br>
 11:30 <B>{Sending}</B> <b><i>(\aposteilantes\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle<br>
 of \apostell&#333;\, coincident action with \epoi&#275;san\ <b><i>(did)</i></b>. <B>{To the<br>
 elders}</B> <b><i>(\pros tous presbuterous\)</i></b>. The first use of that term<br>
 for the Christian preachers. In <!-#-->20:17,28 "elders" and "bishops"<br>
 are used interchangeably as in <!-#-->Tit 1:5,7. The term probably<br>
 arose gradually and holds a position in the church similar to the<br>
 same term in the synagogue. The apostles were apparently absent<br>
 from Jerusalem at this time and they were no longer concerned<br>
 with serving tables. In <!-#-->21:18 Paul presented the later<br>
 collection also to the elders. Since Peter and James <b><i>(till his<br>
 death)</i></b> were in Jerusalem during the persecution in chapter 12 it<br>
 is probable that the visit of Barnabas and Saul to Jerusalem came<br>
 really after that persecution for Peter left Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->12:17)</i></b>.<br>
 The elders here mentioned may include the preachers in Judea also<br>
 outside of Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->26:20)</i></b>.<br>
