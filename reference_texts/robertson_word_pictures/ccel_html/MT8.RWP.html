<p>8:2 <B>{If thou wilt}</B> <b><i>(\ean thel&#275;is\)</i></b>. The leper knew that Jesus had<br>
 the power to heal him. His doubt was about his willingness. "Men<br>
 more easily believe in miraculous power than in miraculous love"<br>
 <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. This is a condition of the third class <b><i>(undetermined,<br>
 but with prospect of being determined)</i></b>, a hopeful doubt at any<br>
 rate. Jesus accepted his challenge by "I will." The command to<br>
 "tell no one" was to suppress excitement and prevent hostility.<br>
 <br>
 8:5 <B>{Unto him}</B> <b><i>(\aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Dative in spite of the genitive<br>
 absolute \eiselthontos autou\ as in verse <!-#-->1, a not infrequent<br>
 Greek idiom, especially in the _koin&#275;_.<br>
 <br>
 8:6 <B>{Grievously tormented}</B> <b><i>(\dein&#333;s basanizomenos\)</i></b>. Participle<br>
 present passive from root \basanos\ <b><i>(see on &#175;Mt 4:24)</i></b>. The boy<br>
 <b><i>(\pais\)</i></b>, slave <b><i>(\doulos\, <!-#-->Lu 7:2)</i></b>, was a bedridden<br>
 <b><i>(\bebl&#275;tai\, perfect passive indicative of \ball&#333;\)</i></b> paralytic.<br>
 <br>
 8:7 <B>{I will come and heal him}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; elth&#333;n therapeus&#333; auton\)</i></b>.<br>
 Future indicative, not deliberative subjunctive in question<br>
 <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. The word here for heal <b><i>(\therapeus&#333;\)</i></b> means first to<br>
 serve, give medical attention, then cure, restore to health. The<br>
 centurion uses the more definite word for healing <b><i>(\iath&#275;setai\<br>
 <!-#-->8:8)</i></b> as Matthew does in <!-#-->8:13 <b><i>(\iath&#275;\)</i></b>. Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:11)</i></b>,<br>
 like a physician, says that Jesus healed <b><i>(\iato\)</i></b> those in need<br>
 of treatment <b><i>(\therapeias\)</i></b>, but the distinction is not always<br>
 observed. In <!-#-->Ac 28:8 Luke uses \iasato\ of the miraculous<br>
 healings in Malta by Paul while he employs \etherapeuonto\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 28:9)</i></b> apparently of the practice of Luke the physician <b><i>(so W. M.<br>
 Ramsay)</i></b>. Matthew represents the centurion himself as speaking to<br>
 Jesus while Luke has it that two committees from the centurion<br>
 brought the messages, apparently a more detailed narrative. What<br>
 one does through others he does himself as Pilate "scourged<br>
 Jesus" <b><i>(had him scourged)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:9 <B>{For I also am a man under authority}</B> <b><i>(\kai gar eg&#333; anthr&#333;pos<br>
 hupo exousian\)</i></b>. "Also" is in the text, though the \kai\ here may<br>
 mean "even," even I in my subordinate position have soldiers<br>
 under me. As a military man he had learned obedience to his<br>
 superiors and so expected obedience to his commands, instant<br>
 obedience <b><i>(aorist imperatives and aoristic present indicatives)</i></b>.<br>
 Hence his faith in Christ's power over the illness of the boy<br>
 even without coming. Jesus had only to speak with a word <b><i>(<!-#-->8:8)</i></b>,<br>
 say the word, and it would be done.<br>
 <br>
 8:10 <B>{So great faith}</B> <b><i>(\tosaut&#275;n pistin\)</i></b>. In a Roman centurion<br>
 and greater than in any of the Jews. In like manner Jesus<br>
 marvelled at the great faith of the Canaanitish woman <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 15:28)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:11 <B>{Sit down}</B> <b><i>(\anaklith&#275;sontai\)</i></b>. Recline at table on couches<br>
 as Jews and Romans did. Hence Leonardo da Vinci's famous picture<br>
 of the Last Supper is an anachronism with all seated at table in<br>
 modern style.<br>
 <br>
 8:12 <B>{The sons of the kingdom}</B> <b><i>(\hoi huioi t&#275;s basileias\)</i></b>. A<br>
 favourite Hebrew idiom like "son of hell" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 23:15)</i></b>, "sons of<br>
 this age" <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 16:8)</i></b>. The Jews felt that they had a natural<br>
 right to the privileges of the kingdom because of descent from<br>
 Abraham <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 3:9)</i></b>. But mere natural birth did not bring<br>
 spiritual sonship as the Baptist had taught before Jesus did.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Into the outer darkness}</B> <b><i>(\eis to skotos to ex&#333;teron\)</i></b>.<br>
 Comparative adjective like our "further out," the darkness<br>
 outside the limits of the lighted palace, one of the figures for<br>
 hell or punishment <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 23:13; 25:30)</i></b>. The repeated article<br>
 makes it bolder and more impressive, "the darkness the outside,"<br>
 there where the wailing and gnashing of teeth is heard in the<br>
 thick blackness of night.<br>
 <br>
 8:14 <B>{Lying sick of a fever}</B> <b><i>(\bibl&#275;men&#275;n kai puressousan\)</i></b>. Two<br>
 participles, bedridden <b><i>(perfect passive of \ball&#333;\)</i></b> and burning<br>
 with fever <b><i>(present active)</i></b>. How long the fever had had her we<br>
 have no means of knowing, possibly a sudden and severe attack<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:30)</i></b>, as they tell Jesus about her on reaching the house<br>
 of Peter. We are not told what kind of fever it was. Fever itself<br>
 was considered a disease. "Fever" is from German feuer <b><i>(fire)</i></b><br>
 like the Greek \pur\.<br>
 <br>
 8:15 <B>{Touched her hand}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;psato t&#275;s cheiros aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. In loving<br>
 sympathy as the Great Physician and like any good doctor today.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Ministered}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;konei\)</i></b>. "Began to minister" <b><i>(conative<br>
 imperfect)</i></b> at once to Jesus at table in gratitude and love.<br>
 <br>
 8:16 <B>{When even was come}</B> <b><i>(\opsias genomen&#275;s\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute. A beautiful sunset scene at the close of the Sabbath<br>
 day <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:21)</i></b>. Then the crowds came as Jesus stood in the door<br>
 of Peter's house <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:33; Mt 8:14)</i></b> as all the city gathered<br>
 there with the sick, "all those who had it bad" <b><i>(see on &#175;Mt<br>
 4:24)</i></b> and he healed them "with a word" <b><i>(\log&#333;i\)</i></b>. It was a never<br>
 to be forgotten memory for those who saw it.<br>
 <br>
 8:17 <B>{Himself took our infirmities and bare our diseases}</B> <b><i>(\autos<br>
 tas astheneias elaben kai tas nosous ebastasen\)</i></b>. A quotation<br>
 from <!-#-->Isa 53:4. It is not clear in what sense Matthew applies<br>
 the words in Isaiah whether in the precise sense of the Hebrew or<br>
 in an independent manner. Moffatt translates it: "He took away<br>
 our sicknesses, and bore the burden of our diseases." Goodspeed<br>
 puts it: "He took our sickness and carried away our diseases."<br>
 Deissmann <b><i>(_Bible Studies_, pp. 102f.)</i></b> thinks that Matthew has<br>
 made a free interpretation of the Hebrew, has discarded the<br>
 translation of the Septuagint, and has transposed the two Hebrew<br>
 verbs so that Matthew means: "He took upon himself our pains, and<br>
 bore our diseases." Plummer holds that "It is impossible, and<br>
 also unnecessary, to understand what the Evangelist understood by<br>
 'took ' <b><i>(\elaben\)</i></b> and 'bare' <b><i>(\ebastasen\)</i></b>. It at least must<br>
 mean that Christ removed their sufferings from the sufferers. He<br>
 can hardly have meant that the diseases were transferred to<br>
 Christ." \Bastaz&#333;\ occurs freely in the papyri with the sense of<br>
 lift, carry, endure, carry away <b><i>(the commonest meaning, Moulton<br>
 and Milligan, _Vocabulary_)</i></b>, pilfer. In <!-#-->Mt 3:11 we have the<br>
 common vernacular use to take off sandals. The Attic Greek did<br>
 not use it in the sense of carrying off. "This passage is the<br>
 cornerstone of the faith-cure theory, which claims that the<br>
 atonement of Christ includes provision for _bodily_ no less than<br>
 for spiritual healing, and therefore insists on translating 'took<br>
 away'" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. We have seen that the word \bastaz&#333;\ will<br>
 possibly allow that meaning, but I agree with McNeile: "The<br>
 passage, _as Mt. employs it_, has no bearing on the doctrine of<br>
 the atonement." But Jesus does show his sympathy with us.<br>
 "Christ's sympathy with the sufferers was so intense that he<br>
 really felt their weaknesses and pains." In our burdens Jesus<br>
 steps under the load with us and helps us to carry on.<br>
 <br>
 8:19 <B>{A scribe}</B> <b><i>(\heis grammateus\)</i></b>. One <b><i>(\heis\)</i></b>="a," indefinite<br>
 article. Already a disciple as shown by "another of the<br>
 disciples" <b><i>(\heteros t&#333;n math&#275;t&#333;n\)</i></b> in <!-#-->8:21. He calls Jesus<br>
 "Teacher" <b><i>(\didaskale\)</i></b>, but he seems to be a "bumptious" brother<br>
 full of self-confidence and self-complacency. "Even one of that<br>
 most unimpressionable class, in spirit and tendency utterly<br>
 opposed to the ways of Jesus" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Yet Jesus deals gently<br>
 with him.<br>
 <br>
 8:20 <B>{Holes}</B> <b><i>(\ph&#333;leous\)</i></b>. A lurking hole, burrow. <B>{Nests}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katask&#275;n&#333;seis\)</i></b>. "Roosts, i.e. leafy, \sk&#275;nai\ for settling at<br>
 night <b><i>(_tabernacula, habitacula_)</i></b>, not nests" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. In the<br>
 Septuagint it is used of God tabernacling in the Sanctuary. The<br>
 verb <b><i>(\katask&#275;no&#333;\)</i></b> is there used of birds <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps 103:12)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{The Son of man}</B> <b><i>(\tho huios tou anthr&#333;pou\)</i></b>. This remarkable<br>
 expression, applied to himself by Jesus so often, appears here<br>
 for the first time. There is a considerable modern literature<br>
 devoted to it. "It means much for the Speaker, who has chosen it<br>
 deliberately, in connection with private reflections, at whose<br>
 nature we can only guess, by study of the many occasions on which<br>
 the name is used" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Often it means the Representative Man.<br>
 It may sometimes stand for the Aramaic _barnasha_, the man, but<br>
 in most instances that idea will not suit. Jesus uses it as a<br>
 concealed Messianic title. It is possible that this scribe would<br>
 not understand the phrase at all. Bruce thinks that here Jesus<br>
 means "the unprivileged Man," worse off than the foxes and the<br>
 birds. Jesus spoke Greek as well as Aramaic. It is inconceivable<br>
 that the Gospels should never call Jesus "the Son of man" and<br>
 always credit it to him as his own words if he did not so term<br>
 himself, about eighty times in all, thirty-three in Matthew.<br>
 Jesus in his early ministry, except at the very start in <!-#-->Joh 4,<br>
 abstains from calling himself Messiah. This term suited his<br>
 purpose exactly to get the people used to his special claim as<br>
 Messiah when he is ready to make it openly.<br>
 <br>
 8:21 <B>{And bury my father}</B> <b><i>(\kai thapsai ton patera mou\)</i></b>. The<br>
 first man was an enthusiast. This one is overcautious. It is by<br>
 no means certain that the father was dead. Tobit urged his son<br>
 Tobias to be sure to bury him: "Son, when I am dead, bury me"<br>
 <b><i>(Tobit 4:3)</i></b>. The probability is that this disciple means that,<br>
 after his father is dead and buried, he will then be free to<br>
 follow Jesus. "At the present day, an Oriental, with his father<br>
 sitting by his side, has been known to say respecting his future<br>
 projects: 'But I must first bury my father!'" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. Jesus<br>
 wanted first things first. But even if his father was not<br>
 actually dead, service to Christ comes first.<br>
 <br>
 8:22 <B>{Leave the dead to bury their own dead}</B> <b><i>(\aphes tous nekrous<br>
 thapsai tous heaut&#333;n nekrous\)</i></b>. The spiritually dead are always<br>
 on hand to bury the physically dead, if one's real duty is with<br>
 Jesus. Chrysostom says that, while it is a good deed to bury the<br>
 dead, it is a better one to preach Christ.<br>
 <br>
 8:24 <B>{But he was asleep}</B> <b><i>(\autos de ekatheuden\)</i></b>. Imperfect, was<br>
 sleeping. Picturesque scene. The Sea of Galilee is 680 feet below<br>
 the Mediterranean Sea. These sudden squalls come down from the<br>
 summit of Hermon with terrific force <b><i>(\seismos megas\)</i></b> like an<br>
 earthquake. Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 4:37)</i></b> and Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:23)</i></b> term it a<br>
 whirlwind <b><i>(\lailaps\)</i></b> in furious gusts.<br>
 <br>
 8:25 <B>{Save, Lord; we perish}</B> <b><i>(\Kurie, s&#333;son, apollumetha\)</i></b>. More<br>
 exactly, "Lord, save us at once <b><i>(aorist)</i></b>, we are perishing<br>
 <b><i>(present linear)</i></b>."<br>
 <br>
 8:27 <B>{Even the winds and the sea obey him}</B> <b><i>(\Kai hoi an&#275;moi kai<br>
 h&#275; thalassa aut&#333;i hupakouousin\)</i></b>. A nature miracle. Even a sudden<br>
 drop in the wind would not at once calm the sea. "J. Weiss<br>
 explains that by 'an astonishing coincidence' the storm happened<br>
 to lull at the moment that Jesus spoke!" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. Some minds<br>
 are easily satisfied by their own stupidities.<br>
 <br>
 8:28 <B>{The country of the Gadarenes}</B> <b><i>(\ten ch&#333;ran t&#333;n Gadar&#275;n&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 This is the correct text in Matthew while in <!-#-->Mr 5:1 and <!-#-->Lu<br>
 8:26 it is "the country of the Gerasenes." Dr. Thomson<br>
 discovered by the lake the ruins of Khersa <b><i>(Gerasa)</i></b>. This village<br>
 is in the district of the city of Gadara some miles southeastward<br>
 so that it can be called after Gerasa or Gadara. So Matthew<br>
 speaks of "two demoniacs" while Mark and Luke mention only one,<br>
 the leading one. "<B>{The tombs}</B>" <b><i>(\t&#333;n mn&#275;mei&#333;n\)</i></b> were chambers cut<br>
 into the mountain side common enough in Palestine then and now.<br>
 On the eastern side of the lake the precipitous cliffs are of<br>
 limestone formation and full of caves. It is one of the proofs<br>
 that one is a maniac that he haunts the tombs. People shunned the<br>
 region as dangerous because of the madmen.<br>
 <br>
 8:29 <B>{Thou Son of God}</B> <b><i>(\huie tou theou\)</i></b>. The recognition of<br>
 Jesus by the demons is surprising. The whole subject of<br>
 demonology is difficult. Some hold that it is merely the ancient<br>
 way of describing disease. But that does not explain the<br>
 situation here. Jesus is represented as treating the demons as<br>
 real existences separate from the human personality. Missionaries<br>
 in China today claim that they have seen demons cast out. The<br>
 devil knew Jesus clearly and it is not strange that Jesus was<br>
 recognized by the devil's agents. They know that there is nothing<br>
 in common between them and the Son of God <b><i>(\h&#275;min kai soi\,<br>
 ethical dative)</i></b> and they fear torment "before the time" <b><i>(\pro<br>
 kairou\)</i></b>. Usually \ta daimonia\ is the word in the New Testament<br>
 for demons, but in <!-#-->8:31 we have \hoi daimones\ <b><i>(the only<br>
 example in the N.T.)</i></b>. \Daimonion\ is a diminutive of \daim&#333;n\. In<br>
 Homer \daim&#333;n\ is used synonymously with \theos\ and \thea\.<br>
 Hesiod employed \daim&#333;n\ of men of the golden age as tutelary<br>
 deities. Homer has the adjective \daimonios\ usually in an evil<br>
 sense. Empedocles considered the demons both bad and good. They<br>
 were thus used to relieve the gods and goddesses of much<br>
 rascality. Grote <b><i>(_History of Greece_)</i></b> notes that the Christians<br>
 were thus by pagan usage justified in calling idolatry the<br>
 worship of demons. See <!-#-->1Co 10:20f.; 1Ti 4:1; Re 9:20; 16:13f.<br>
 In the Gospels demons are the same as unclean spirits <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 5:12,15; 3:22,30; Lu 4:33)</i></b>. The demons are disturbers <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b><br>
 of the whole life of man <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 5:2f.; 7:25; Mt 12:45; Lu<br>
 13:11,16)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:32 <B>{Rushed down the steep}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;rm&#275;sen kata tou kr&#275;mnou\)</i></b>. Down<br>
 from the cliff <b><i>(ablative case)</i></b> into the sea. Constative aorist<br>
 tense. The influence of mind on matter is now understood better<br>
 than formerly, but we have the mastery of the mind of the Master<br>
 on the minds of the maniacs, the power of Christ over the demons,<br>
 over the herd of hogs. Difficulties in plenty exist for those who<br>
 see only folk-lore and legend, but plain enough if we take Jesus<br>
 to be really Lord and Saviour. The incidental destruction of the<br>
 hogs need not trouble us when we are so familiar with nature's<br>
 tragedies which we cannot comprehend.<br>
 <br>
 8:34 <B>{That he would depart}</B> <b><i>(\hop&#333;s metab&#275;i\)</i></b>. The whole city was<br>
 excited over the destruction of the hogs and begged Jesus to<br>
 leave, forgetful of the healing of the demoniacs in their concern<br>
 over the loss of property. They cared more for hogs than for<br>
 human souls, as often happens today.<br>
