<p>2:1 <B>{Touching the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ}</B> <b><i>(\huper t&#275;s<br>
 parousias tou Kuriou <b><i>(h&#275;m&#333;n)</i></b> I&#275;sou Christou\)</i></b>. For \er&#333;t&#333;men\, to<br>
 beseech, see on &#175;1Th 4:1; 4:12. \Huper\ originally meant over,<br>
 in behalf of, instead of, but here it is used like \peri\,<br>
 around, concerning as in <!-#-->1:4; 1Th 3:2; 5:10, common in the<br>
 papyri <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 632)</i></b>. For the distinction<br>
 between \Parousia, Epiphaneia\ <b><i>(Epiphany)</i></b>, and \Apokalupsis\<br>
 <b><i>(Revelation)</i></b> as applied to the Second Coming of Christ see<br>
 Milligan on _Thessalonian Epistles_, pp. 145-151, in the light of<br>
 the papyri. \Parousia\ lays emphasis on the <B>{presence}</B> of the<br>
 Lord with his people, \epiphaneia\ on his <B>{manifestation}</B> of the<br>
 power and love of God, \apokalupsis\ on the <B>{revelation}</B> of God's<br>
 purpose and plan in the Second Coming of the Lord Jesus. <B>{And our<br>
 gathering together unto him}</B> <b><i>(\kai h&#275;m&#333;n episunag&#333;g&#275;s ep'<br>
 auton\)</i></b>. A late word found only in II Macc. 2:7; <!-#-->2Th 2:1; Heb<br>
 10:25 till Deissmann <b><i>(_Light from the Ancient East_, p. 103)</i></b><br>
 found it on a stele in the island of Syme, off Caria, meaning<br>
 "collection." Paul is referring to the rapture, mentioned in <!-#-->1Th<br>
 4:15-17, and the being forever with the Lord thereafter. Cf.<br>
 also <!-#-->Mt 24:31; Mr 13:27.<br>
 <br>
 2:2 <B>{To the end that}</B> <b><i>(\eis to\)</i></b>. One of Paul's favourite idioms<br>
 for purpose, \eis to\ and the infinitive. <B>{Ye be not quickly<br>
 shaken}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; tache&#333;s saleuth&#275;nai humas\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 infinitive of \saleu&#333;\, old verb to agitate, to cause to totter<br>
 like a reed <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 11:7)</i></b>, the earth <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 12:26)</i></b>. Usual negative<br>
 \m&#275;\ and accusative of general reference \humas\ with the<br>
 infinitive. <B>{From your mind}</B> <b><i>(\apo tou noos\)</i></b>. Ablative case of<br>
 nous, mind, reason, sober sense, "from your witte" <b><i>(Wyclif)</i></b>, to<br>
 "keep their heads." <B>{Nor yet be troubled}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;de throeisthai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Old verb \throe&#333;\, to cry aloud <b><i>(from \throos\, clamour, tumult)</i></b>,<br>
 to be in a state of nervous excitement <b><i>(present passive<br>
 infinitive, as if it were going on)</i></b>, "a continued state of<br>
 agitation following the definite shock received <b><i>(\saleuth&#275;nai\)</i></b>"<br>
 <b><i>(Milligan)</i></b>. <B>{Either by spirit}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;te dia pneumatos\)</i></b>. By<br>
 ecstatic utterance <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 5:10)</i></b>. The nervous fear that the coming<br>
 was to be at once prohibited by \m&#275;de\ Paul divides into three<br>
 sources by \m&#275;te, m&#275;te, m&#275;te\. No individual claim to divine<br>
 revelation <b><i>(the gift of prophecy)</i></b> can justify the statement. <B>{Or<br>
 by word}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;te dia logou\)</i></b>. Oral statement of a conversation<br>
 with Paul <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b> to this effect <B>{as from us}</B>. An easy way to<br>
 set aside Paul's first Epistle by report of a private remark from<br>
 Paul. <B>{Or by epistle as from us}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;te di' epistol&#275;s h&#333;s di'<br>
 h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->1Th 4:13-5:3 Paul had plainly said that Jesus would<br>
 come as a thief in the night and had shown that the dead would<br>
 not be left out in the rapture. But evidently some one claimed to<br>
 have a private epistle from Paul which supported the view that<br>
 Jesus was coming at once, <B>{as that the day of the Lord is now<br>
 present}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s hoti enest&#275;ken h&#275; h&#275;mera tou kuriou\)</i></b>. Perfect<br>
 active indicative of \enist&#275;mi\, old verb, to place in, but<br>
 intransitive in this tense to stand in or at or near. So "is<br>
 imminent" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. The verb is common in the papyri. In <!-#-->1Co<br>
 3:22; Ro 8:38 we have a contrast between \ta enest&#333;ta\, the<br>
 things present, and \ta mellonta\, the things future <b><i>(to come)</i></b>.<br>
 The use of \h&#333;s hoti\ may be disparaging here, though that is not<br>
 true in <!-#-->2Co 5:19. In the _Koin&#275;_ it comes in the vernacular to<br>
 mean simply "that" <b><i>(Moulton, _Proleg_., p. 212)</i></b>, but that hardly<br>
 seems the case in the N.T. <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1033)</i></b>. Here<br>
 it means "to wit that," though "as that" or "as if" does not miss<br>
 it much. Certainly it flatly denies that by conversation or by<br>
 letter he had stated that the second coming was immediately at<br>
 hand. "It is this misleading assertion that accounts both for the<br>
 increased discouragement of the faint-hearted to encourage whom<br>
 Paul writes <!-#-->1:3-2:17, and for the increased meddlesomeness of<br>
 the idle brethren to warn whom Paul writes <!-#-->3:1-18" <b><i>(Frame)</i></b>. It<br>
 is enough to give one pause to note Paul's indignation over this<br>
 use of his name by one of the over-zealous advocates of the view<br>
 that Christ was coming at once. It is true that Paul was still<br>
 alive, but, if such a "pious fraud" was so common and easily<br>
 condoned as some today argue, it is difficult to explain Paul's<br>
 evident anger. Moreover, Paul's words should make us hesitate to<br>
 affirm that Paul definitely proclaimed the early return of Jesus.<br>
 He hoped for it undoubtedly, but he did not specifically proclaim<br>
 it as so many today assert and accuse him of misleading the early<br>
 Christians with a false presentation.<br>
 <br>
 2:3 <B>{Let no man beguile you in any wise}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; tis humas<br>
 exapat&#275;s&#275;i kata m&#275;dena tropon\)</i></b>. First aorist active subjunctive<br>
 of \exapata&#333;\ <b><i>(old verb to deceive, strengthened form of simple<br>
 verb \apata&#333;\)</i></b> with double negative <b><i>(\m&#275; tis, m&#275;dena\)</i></b> in accord<br>
 with regular Greek idiom as in <!-#-->1Co 16:11 rather than the aorist<br>
 imperative which does occur sometimes in the third person as in<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 13:15 <b><i>(\m&#275; katabat&#333;\)</i></b>. Paul broadens the warning to go<br>
 beyond conversation and letter. He includes "tricks" of any kind.<br>
 It is amazing how gullible some of the saints are when a new<br>
 deceiver pulls off some stunts in religion. <B>{For it will not be}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hoti\)</i></b>. There is an ellipse here of \ouk estai\ <b><i>(or<br>
 \gen&#275;setai\)</i></b> to be supplied after \hoti\. Westcott and Hort make<br>
 an anacoluthon at the end of verse <!-#-->4. The meaning is clear.<br>
 \Hoti\ is causal, because, but the verb is understood. The second<br>
 coming not only is not "imminent," but will not take place before<br>
 certain important things take place, a definite rebuff to the<br>
 false enthusiasts of verse <!-#-->2. <B>{Except the falling away come<br>
 first}</B> <b><i>(\ean m&#275; elth&#275;i h&#275; apostasia pr&#333;ton\)</i></b>. Negative condition<br>
 of the third class, undetermined with prospect of determination<br>
 and the aorist subjunctive. \Apostasia\ is the late form of<br>
 \apostasis\ and is our word apostasy. Plutarch uses it of<br>
 political revolt and it occurs in I Macc. 2:15 about Antiochus<br>
 Epiphanes who was enforcing the apostasy from Judaism to<br>
 Hellenism. In <!-#-->Jos 22:22 it occurs for rebellion against the<br>
 Lord. It seems clear that the word here means a religious revolt<br>
 and the use of the definite article <b><i>(\h&#275;\)</i></b> seems to mean that<br>
 Paul had spoken to the Thessalonians about it. The only other New<br>
 Testament use of the word is in <!-#-->Ac 21:21 where it means<br>
 apostasy from Moses. It is not clear whether Paul means revolt of<br>
 the Jews from God, of Gentiles from God, of Christians from God,<br>
 or of the apostasy that includes all classes within and without<br>
 the body of Christians. But it is to be <B>{first}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;ton\)</i></b> before<br>
 Christ comes again. Note this adverb when only two events are<br>
 compared <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ac 1:1)</i></b>. <B>{And the man of sin be revealed, the son<br>
 of perdition}</B> <b><i>(\kai apokaluphth&#275;i ho anthr&#333;pos t&#275;s anomias, ho<br>
 huios t&#275;s ap&#333;leias\)</i></b>. First aorist passive subjunctive after \ean<br>
 m&#275;\ and same condition as with \elth&#275;i\. The use of this verb<br>
 \apokalupt&#333;\, like \apokalupsin\ of the second coming in <!-#-->1:7,<br>
 seems to note the superhuman character <b><i>(Milligan)</i></b> of the event<br>
 and the same verb is repeated in verses <!-#-->6,8. The implication is<br>
 that <B>{the man of sin}</B> is hidden somewhere who will be suddenly<br>
 manifested just as false apostles pose as angels of light <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co<br>
 11:13ff.)</i></b>, whether the crowning event of the apostasy or another<br>
 name for the same event. Lightfoot notes the parallel between the<br>
 man of sin, of whom sin is the special characteristic <b><i>(genitive<br>
 case, a Hebraism for the lawless one in verse <!-#-->8)</i></b> and Christ.<br>
 Both Christ and the adversary of Christ are revealed, there is<br>
 mystery about each, both make divine claims <b><i>(verse <!-#-->4)</i></b>. He seems<br>
 to be the Antichrist of <!-#-->1Jo 2:18. The terrible phrase, the son<br>
 of perdition, is applied to Judas in <!-#-->Joh 17:12 <b><i>(like Judas<br>
 doomed to perdition)</i></b>, but here to the lawless one <b><i>(\ho anomos\,<br>
 verse <!-#-->8)</i></b>, who is not Satan, but some one definite person who is<br>
 doing the work of Satan. Note the definite article each time.<br>
 <br>
 2:4 <B>{He that opposeth and exalteth himself}</B> <b><i>(\ho antikeimenos kai<br>
 huperairomenos\)</i></b>. Like John's Antichrist this one opposes<br>
 <b><i>(\anti-\)</i></b> Christ and exalts himself <b><i>(direct middle of<br>
 \huperair&#333;\, old verb to lift oneself up <B>{above}</B> others, only<br>
 here and <!-#-->2Co 12:7 in N.T.)</i></b>, but not Satan, but an agent of<br>
 Satan. This participial clause is in apposition with the two<br>
 preceding phrases, the man of sin, the son of perdition. Note<br>
 <!-#-->1Co 8:5 about one called God and <!-#-->Ac 17:23 for \sebasma\ <b><i>(from<br>
 \sebazomai\)</i></b>, object of worship, late word, in N.T. only in these<br>
 two passages. <B>{So that he sitteth in the temple of God}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste<br>
 auton eis ton naon tou theou kathisai\)</i></b>. Another example of the<br>
 infinitive with \h&#333;ste\ for result. Caius Caligula had made a<br>
 desperate attempt to have his statue set up for worship in the<br>
 Temple in Jerusalem. This incident may lie behind Paul's language<br>
 here. <B>{Setting himself forth as God}</B> <b><i>(\apodeiknunta heauton hoti<br>
 estin theos\)</i></b>. Present active participle <b><i>(\mi\ form)</i></b> of<br>
 \apodeiknumi\, agreeing in case with \auton\, <B>{showing himself<br>
 that he is God}</B>. Caligula claimed to be God. Moffatt doubts if<br>
 Paul is identifying this deception with the imperial cultus at<br>
 this stage. Lightfoot thinks that the deification of the Roman<br>
 emperor supplied Paul's language here. Wetstein notes a coin of<br>
 Julius with \theos\ on one side and \Thessalonike&#333;n\ on the<br>
 other. In <!-#-->1Jo 2:18 we are told of "many antichrists" some of<br>
 whom had already come. Hence it is not clear that Paul has in<br>
 mind only one individual or even individuals at all rather than<br>
 evil principles, for in verse <!-#-->6 he speaks of \to katechon\<br>
 <b><i>(that which restraineth)</i></b> while in verse <!-#-->7 it is \ho katech&#333;n\<br>
 <b><i>(the one that restraineth)</i></b>. Frame argues for a combination of<br>
 Belial and Antichrist as the explanation of Paul's language. But<br>
 the whole subject is left by Paul in such a vague form that we<br>
 can hardly hope to clear it up. It is possible that his own<br>
 preaching while with them gave his readers a clue that we do not<br>
 possess.<br>
 <br>
 2:5 <B>{When I was yet with you}</B> <b><i>(\eti &#333;n pros humas\)</i></b>. The present<br>
 participle takes the time of the verb \elegon\ <b><i>(imperfect<br>
 active)</i></b>, <B>{I used to tell you these things}</B>. So Paul recalls their<br>
 memory of his words and leaves us without the clue to his idea.<br>
 We know that one of the charges against him was that Jesus was<br>
 another king, a rival to Caesar <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 17:7)</i></b>. That leads one to<br>
 wonder how far Paul went when there in contrasting the kingdom of<br>
 the world of which Rome was ruler and the kingdom of God of which<br>
 Christ is king. Frame notes Paul's abrupt question here "with an<br>
 unfinished sentence behind him" <b><i>(verses <!-#-->3f.)</i></b>, even "with a<br>
 trace of impatience."<br>
 <br>
 2:6 <B>{That which restraineth}</B> <b><i>(\to katechon\)</i></b>. <B>{And now you know}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai nun oidate\)</i></b>, says Paul in this cryptic apocalyptic<br>
 passage. Unfortunately we do not know what Paul means by <B>{that<br>
 which restrains}</B> <b><i>(holds back, \katechon\)</i></b>, neuter here and<br>
 masculine in verse <!-#-->7 \ho katech&#333;n\. "This impersonal principle<br>
 or power is capable also of manifesting itself under a personal<br>
 form" <b><i>(Milligan)</i></b>. "He is Satan's messiah, an infernal caricature<br>
 of the true Messiah" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>. Warfield <b><i>(_Expositor_, III, iv,<br>
 pp. 30ff.)</i></b> suggested that the man of lawlessness is the imperial<br>
 line with its rage for deification and that the Jewish state was<br>
 the restraining power. But God overrules all human history and<br>
 his ultimate purpose is wrought out. <B>{To the end that}</B> <b><i>(\eis<br>
 to\)</i></b>. Another example of \eis to\ and the infinitive for purpose.<br>
 <B>{In his own season}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i autou kair&#333;i\)</i></b>. Note \autou\ <b><i>(his)</i></b>,<br>
 not \heautou\ <b><i>(his own)</i></b>, <B>{revealed in his time}</B>, in the time set<br>
 him by God.<br>
 <br>
 2:7 <B>{For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work}</B> <b><i>(\to gar<br>
 must&#275;rion &#275;d&#275; energeitai t&#275;s anomias\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->1Th 2:13 for<br>
 \energeitai\. The genitive \t&#275;s anomias\ <b><i>(lawlessness)</i></b> describes<br>
 \to must&#275;rion\ <b><i>(note emphatic position of both)</i></b>. This mystery<br>
 <b><i>(\must&#275;rion\ secret, from \must&#275;s\, an initiate, \mue&#333;\, to wink<br>
 or blink)</i></b> means here the secret purpose of lawlessness already at<br>
 work, the only instance of this usage in the N.T. where it is<br>
 used of the kingdom of God <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 13:11)</i></b>, of God <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 2:1)</i></b> and<br>
 God's will <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph 1:9)</i></b>, of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph 3:4)</i></b>, of the gospel<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph 6:9)</i></b>, of faith <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 3:9)</i></b>, of godliness <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 3:16)</i></b>, of<br>
 the seven stars <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 1:20)</i></b>, of the woman <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 17:7)</i></b>. But this<br>
 secret will be "revealed" and then we shall understand clearly<br>
 what Paul's meaning is here. <B>{Until he be taken out of the way}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\he&#333;s ek mesou gen&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Usual construction with \he&#333;s\ for the<br>
 future <b><i>(aorist middle subjunctive, \gen&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Note absence of<br>
 \an\ as often in N.T. and the \Koin&#275;\. Paul uses \he&#333;s\ only here<br>
 and <!-#-->1Co 4:5. When the obstacle is removed then the mystery of<br>
 lawlessness will be revealed in plain outline.<br>
 <br>
 2:8 <B>{And then}</B> <b><i>(\kai tote\)</i></b>. Emphatic note of time, <B>{then}</B> when<br>
 the restraining one <b><i>(\ho katech&#333;n\)</i></b> is taken out of the way, then<br>
 \the lawless one\ <b><i>(\ho anomos\)</i></b>, the man of sin, the man of<br>
 perdition, will be revealed. <B>{Whom the Lord [Jesus] shall slay}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hon ho kurios [I&#275;sous] anelei\)</i></b>. Whether Jesus is genuine or<br>
 not, he is meant by Lord. \Anelei\ is a late future from<br>
 \anaire&#333;\, in place of \anair&#275;sei\. Paul uses <!-#-->Isa 11:4<br>
 <b><i>(combining <B>{by the word of his mouth}</B> with <B>{in breath through<br>
 lips}</B>)</i></b> to picture the triumph of Christ over this adversary. It<br>
 is a powerful picture how the mere breath of the Lord will<br>
 destroy this arch-enemy <b><i>(Milligan)</i></b>. <B>{And bring to naught by the<br>
 manifestation of his coming}</B> <b><i>(\kai katarg&#275;sei t&#275;i epiphanei&#257;i t&#275;s<br>
 parousias autou\)</i></b>. This verb \katarge&#333;\ <b><i>(\kata, argos\)</i></b> to render<br>
 useless, rare in ancient Greek, appears 25 times in Paul and has<br>
 a variety of renderings. In the papyri it has a weakened sense of<br>
 hinder. It will be a grand fiasco, this advent of the man of sin.<br>
 Paul here uses both \epiphaneia\ <b><i>(\epiphany\, elsewhere in N.T.<br>
 in the Pastorals, familiar to the Greek mind for a visit of a<br>
 god)</i></b> and \parousia\ <b><i>(more familiar to the Jewish mind, but common<br>
 in the papyri)</i></b> of the second coming of Christ. "The apparition of<br>
 Jesus heralds his doom" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>. The mere appearance of Christ<br>
 destroys the adversary <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:9 <B>{Whose coming is}</B> <b><i>(\hou estin h&#275; parousia\)</i></b>. Refers to \hon\<br>
 in verse <!-#-->8. The Antichrist has his \parousia\ also. Deissmann<br>
 <b><i>(_Light from the Ancient East_, pp. 374, 378)</i></b> notes an<br>
 inscription at Epidaurus in which "Asclepius manifested his<br>
 \Parousia\." Antiochus Epiphanes is called _the manifest god_<br>
 <b><i>(III Macc. 5:35)</i></b>. So the two Epiphanies coincide. <B>{Lying wonders}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\terasin pseudous\)</i></b>. "In wonders of a lie." Note here the three<br>
 words for the miracles of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 2:4)</i></b>, power <b><i>(\dunamis\)</i></b>,<br>
 signs <b><i>(\s&#275;meia\)</i></b>, wonders <b><i>(\terata\)</i></b>, but all according to the<br>
 working of Satan <b><i>(\kata energeian tou Satana\, the energy of<br>
 Satan)</i></b> just as Jesus had foretold <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 24:24)</i></b>, wonders that<br>
 would almost lead astray the very elect.<br>
 <br>
 2:10 <B>{With all deceit of unrighteousness}</B> <b><i>(\en pas&#275;i apat&#275;i<br>
 adikias\)</i></b>. This pastmaster of trickery will have at his command<br>
 all the energy and skill of Satan to mislead and deceive. How<br>
 many illustrations lie along the pathway of Christian history.<br>
 <B>{For them that are perishing}</B> <b><i>(\tois apollumenois\)</i></b>. Dative case<br>
 of personal interest. Note this very phrase in <!-#-->2Co 2:15; 4:3.<br>
 Present middle participle of \appollumi\, to destroy, the<br>
 dreadful process goes on. <B>{Because}</B> <b><i>(\anth' hon\)</i></b>. In return for<br>
 which things <b><i>(\anti\ and the genitive of the relative pronoun)</i></b>.<br>
 Same idiom in <!-#-->Lu 1:20; 12:3; 19:44; Ac 12:23 and very common in<br>
 the LXX. <B>{The love of the truth}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n agap&#275;n t&#275;s al&#275;theias\)</i></b>.<br>
 That is the gospel in contrast with _lying_ and _deceit_. <B>{That<br>
 they might be saved}</B> <b><i>(\eis to s&#333;th&#275;nai autous\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive infinitive of \s&#333;z&#333;\ with \eis to\, again, epexegetic<br>
 purpose of <B>{the truth}</B> if they had heeded it.<br>
 <br>
 2:11 <B>{And for this reason God sendeth them}</B> <b><i>(\kai dia touto<br>
 pempei autois ho theos\)</i></b>. Futuristic <b><i>(prophetic)</i></b> present of the<br>
 time when the lawless one is revealed. Here is the definite<br>
 judicial act of God <b><i>(Milligan)</i></b> who gives the wicked over to the<br>
 evil which they have deliberately chosen <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:24,26,28)</i></b>. <B>{A<br>
 working of error}</B> <b><i>(\energeian plan&#275;s\)</i></b>. Terrible result of wilful<br>
 rejection of the truth of God. <B>{That they should believe a lie}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eis to pisteusai autous t&#333;i pseudei\)</i></b>. Note \eis to\ again and<br>
 \t&#333;i pseudei\ <b><i>(the lie, the falsehood already described)</i></b>, a<br>
 contemplated result. Note <!-#-->Ro 1:25 "who changed the truth of God<br>
 into the lie."<br>
 <br>
 2:12 <B>{That they all might be judged}</B> <b><i>(\hina krith&#333;sin pantes\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive subjunctive of \krin&#333;\, to sift, to judge,<br>
 with \hina\. Ultimate purpose, almost result, of the preceding<br>
 obstinate resistance to the truth and "the judicial infatuation<br>
 which overtakes them" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>, now final punishment.<br>
 Condemnation is involved in the fatal choice made. These victims<br>
 of the man of sin did not believe the truth and found pleasure in<br>
 unrighteousness.<br>
 <br>
 2:13 See <!-#-->1:3 for same beginning. <B>{Beloved of the Lord}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;gap&#275;menoi hupo kuriou\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of<br>
 \agapa&#333;\ with \hupo\ and the ablative as in <!-#-->1Th 1:4, only here<br>
 \kuriou\ instead of \theou\, the Lord Jesus rather than God the<br>
 Father. <B>{Because that God chose you}</B> <b><i>(\hoti heilato humas ho<br>
 theos\)</i></b>. First aorist middle indicative of \haire&#333;\, to take, old<br>
 verb, but uncompounded only in N.T. here, <!-#-->Php 1:22; Heb 11:25,<br>
 and here only in sense of <B>{choose}</B>, that being usually<br>
 \exaireomai\ or \prooriz&#333;\. <B>{From the beginning}</B> <b><i>(\ap' arch&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Probably the correct text <b><i>(Aleph D L)</i></b> and not \aparch&#275;n\ <b><i>(first<br>
 fruits, B G P)</i></b>, though here alone in Paul's writings and a hard<br>
 reading, the eternal choice or purpose of God <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 2:7; Eph 1:4;<br>
 2Ti 1:9)</i></b>, while \aparch&#275;n\ is a favourite idea with Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 15:20,23; 16:15; Ro 8:23; 11:16; 16:5)</i></b>. <B>{Unto salvation}</B> <b><i>(\eis<br>
 s&#333;t&#275;rian\)</i></b>. The ultimate goal, final salvation. <B>{In<br>
 sanctification of the Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\en hagiasm&#333;i pneumatos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Subjective genitive \pneumatos\, sanctification wrought by the<br>
 Holy Spirit. <B>{And belief of the truth}</B> <b><i>(\kai pistei al&#275;theias\)</i></b>.<br>
 Objective genitive \al&#275;theias\, belief in the truth.<br>
 <br>
 2:14 <B>{Whereunto}</B> <b><i>(\eis ho\)</i></b>. The goal, that is the final<br>
 salvation <b><i>(\s&#333;t&#275;ria\)</i></b>. Through our gospel <b><i>(\dia tou euaggeliou<br>
 h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. God called the Thessalonians through Paul's preaching as<br>
 he calls men now through the heralds of the Cross as God <B>{chose}</B><br>
 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1Th 2:12; 5:24)</i></b>. <B>{To the obtaining}</B> <b><i>(\eis peripoi&#275;sin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Probably correct translation rather than possession. See on &#175;1Th<br>
 5:9, there <B>{of salvation}</B>, here <B>{of glory}</B> <b><i>(the _shekinah_,<br>
 glory of Jesus)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:15 <B>{So then}</B> <b><i>(\ara oun\)</i></b>. Accordingly then. The illative \ara\<br>
 is supported <b><i>(Ellicott)</i></b> by the collective \oun\ as in <!-#-->1Th 5:6;<br>
 Ga 6:10, etc. Here is the practical conclusion from God's<br>
 elective purpose in such a world crisis. <B>{Stand fast}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\st&#275;kete\)</i></b>. Present imperative active of the late present<br>
 \st&#275;ko\ from \hest&#275;ka\ <b><i>(perfect active of \hist&#275;mi\)</i></b>. See on &#175;1Th<br>
 3:8. <B>{Hold the traditions}</B> <b><i>(\krateite tas paradoseis\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 imperative of \krate&#333;\, old verb, to have masterful grip on a<br>
 thing, either with genitive <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:31)</i></b> or usually the accusative<br>
 as here. \Paradosis\ <b><i>(tradition)</i></b> is an old word for what is<br>
 handed over to one. Dibelius thinks that Paul reveals his Jewish<br>
 training in the use of this word <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 1:14)</i></b>, but the word is a<br>
 perfectly legitimate one for teaching whether oral, <B>{by word}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dia logou\)</i></b>, or written, <B>{by epistle of ours}</B> <b><i>(\di' epistol&#275;s<br>
 h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. Paul draws here no distinction between oral tradition<br>
 and written tradition as was done later. The worth of the<br>
 tradition lies not in the form but in the source and the quality<br>
 of the content. Paul in <!-#-->1Co 11:23 says: "I received from the<br>
 Lord what I also handed over <b><i>(\pared&#333;ka\)</i></b> unto you." He praises<br>
 them because ye "hold fast the traditions even as I delivered<br>
 them unto you." The <B>{tradition}</B> may be merely that of men and so<br>
 worthless and harmful in place of the word of God <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 7:8; Col<br>
 2:6-8)</i></b>. It all depends. It is easy to scoff at truth as mere<br>
 tradition. But human progress in all fields is made by use of the<br>
 old, found to be true, in connection with the new if found to be<br>
 true. In Thessalonica the saints were already the victims of<br>
 theological charlatans with their half-baked theories about the<br>
 second coming of Christ and about social duties and relations.<br>
 <B>{Which ye were taught}</B> <b><i>(\has edidachth&#275;te\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative of \didask&#333;\, to teach, retaining the accusative of<br>
 the thing in the passive as is common with this verb like _doce&#333;_<br>
 in Latin and teach in English.<br>
 <br>
 2:16 <B>{And God our Father}</B> <b><i>(\kai [ho] theos ho pat&#275;r h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. It<br>
 is uncertain whether the first article \ho\ is genuine as it is<br>
 absent in B D. Usually Paul has the Father before Christ except<br>
 here, <!-#-->2Co 13:13; Ga 1:1. <B>{Which loved us}</B> <b><i>(\ho agap&#275;sas<br>
 h&#275;mas\)</i></b>. This singular articular participle refers to \ho pat&#275;r\,<br>
 "though it is difficult to see how St. Paul could otherwise have<br>
 expressed his thought, if he had intended to refer to the Son, as<br>
 well as to the Father. There is probably no instance in St. Paul<br>
 of a plural adjective or verb, when the two Persons of the<br>
 Godhead are mentioned" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. <B>{Eternal comfort}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\parakl&#275;sin ai&#333;nian\)</i></b>. Distinct feminine form of \ai&#333;nios\ here<br>
 instead of masculine as in <!-#-->Mt 25:46.<br>
 <br>
 2:17 <B>{Comfort and stablish}</B> <b><i>(\parakalesai kai st&#275;rixai\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active optative of wish for the future of two common verbs<br>
 \parakale&#333;\ <b><i>(see on &#175;1Th 3:7; 4:18; 5:14)</i></b> and \steriz&#333;\ <b><i>(see on<br>
 &#175;1Th 3:2,13)</i></b>. God is the God of <B>{comfort}</B> <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 1:3-7)</i></b> and<br>
 strength <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:11; 16:25)</i></b>.<br>
