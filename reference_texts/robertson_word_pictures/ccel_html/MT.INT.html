<p>                 THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW<br>
                       BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION<br>
 <br>
         The passing years do not make it any plainer who actually<br>
 wrote our Greek Matthew. Papias records, as quoted by Eusebius,<br>
 that Matthew wrote the _Logia_ of Jesus in Hebrew <b><i>(Aramaic)</i></b>. Is<br>
 our present Matthew a translation of the Aramaic _Logia_ along<br>
 with Mark and other sources as most modern scholars think? If so,<br>
 was the writer the Apostle Matthew or some other disciple? There<br>
 is at present no way to reach a clear decision in the light of<br>
 the known facts. There is no real reason why the Apostle Matthew<br>
 could not have written both the Aramaic _Logia_ and our Greek<br>
 Matthew, unless one is unwilling to believe that he would make<br>
 use of Mark's work on a par with his own. But Mark's book rests<br>
 primarily on the preaching of Simon Peter. Scholfield has<br>
 recently <b><i>(1927)</i></b> published _An Old Hebrew Text of St. Matthew's<br>
 Gospel_. We know quite too little of the origin of the Synoptic<br>
 Gospels to say dogmatically that the Apostle Matthew was not in<br>
 any real sense the author.<br>
 <br>
         If the book is genuine, as I believe, the date becomes a<br>
 matter of interest. Here again there is nothing absolutely<br>
 decisive save that it is later than the Gospel according to Mark<br>
 which it apparently uses. If Mark is given an early date, between<br>
 A.D. 50 to 60, then Matthew's book may be between 60 and 70,<br>
 though many would place it between 70 and 80. It is not certain<br>
 whether Luke wrote after Matthew or not, though that is quite<br>
 possible. There is no definite use of Matthew by Luke that has<br>
 been shown. One guess is as good as another and each decides by<br>
 his own predilections. My own guess is that A.D. 60 is as good as<br>
 any.<br>
 <br>
         In the Gospel itself we find Matthew the publican <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 9:9; 10:3)</i></b> though Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 2:14)</i></b> and Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 5:27)</i></b> call him<br>
 Levi the publican. Evidently therefore he had two names like John<br>
 Mark. It is significant that Jesus called this man from so<br>
 disreputable a business to follow him. He was apparently not a<br>
 disciple of John the Baptist. He was specially chosen by Jesus to<br>
 be one of the Twelve Apostles, a business man called into the<br>
 ministry as was true of the fishermen James and John, Andrew and<br>
 Simon. In the lists of the Apostles he comes either seventh or<br>
 eighth. There is nothing definite told about him in the Gospels<br>
 apart from the circle of the Twelve after the feast which he gave<br>
 to his fellow publicans in honor of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
         Matthew was in the habit of keeping accounts and it is<br>
 quite possible that he took notes of the sayings of Jesus as he<br>
 heard them. At any rate he gives much attention to the teachings<br>
 of Jesus as, for instance, the Sermon on the Mount in chapters<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 5-7, the parables in <!-#-->Mt 13, the denunciation of the<br>
 Pharisees in <!-#-->Mt 23, the great eschatological discourse in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 24; 25. As a publican in Galilee he was not a narrow Jew and so<br>
 we do not expect a book prejudiced in favor of the Jews and<br>
 against the Gentiles. He does seem to show that Jesus is the<br>
 Messiah of Jewish expectation and hope and so makes frequent<br>
 quotations from the Old Testament by way of confirmation and<br>
 illustration. There is no narrow nationalism in Matthew. Jesus is<br>
 both the Messiah of the Jews and the Saviour of the world.<br>
 <br>
         There are ten parables in Matthew not in the other<br>
 Gospels: The Tares, the Hid Treasure, the Net, the Pearl of Great<br>
 Price, the Unmerciful Servant, the Labourers in the Vineyard, the<br>
 Two Sons, the Marriage of the King's Son, the Ten Virgins, the<br>
 Talents. The only miracles in Matthew alone are the Two Blind<br>
 Men, the Coin in the Mouth of the Fish. But Matthew gives the<br>
 narrative of the Birth of Jesus from the standpoint of Joseph<br>
 while Luke tells that wonderful story from the standpoint of<br>
 Mary. There are details of the Death and Resurrection given by<br>
 Matthew alone.<br>
 <br>
         The book follows the same general chronological plan as<br>
 that in Mark, but with various groups like the miracles in <!-#-->Mt 8;<br>
 9, the parables in <!-#-->Mt 13.<br>
 <br>
         The style is free from Hebraisms and has few individual<br>
 peculiarities. The author is fond of the phrase the kingdom of<br>
 heaven and pictures Jesus as the Son of man, but also as the Son<br>
 of God. He sometimes abbreviates Mark's statements and sometimes<br>
 expands them to be more precise.<br>
 <br>
         Plummer shows the broad general plan of both Mark and<br>
 Matthew to be the same as follows:<br>
 <br>
         Introduction to the Gospel: <!-#-->Mr 1:1-13; Mt 3:1-4:11.<br>
 <br>
         Ministry in Galilee: <!-#-->Mr 1:14-6:13; Mt 4:12-13:58.<br>
 <br>
         Ministry in the Neighborhood: <!-#-->Mr 6:14-9:50; Mt<br>
 14:1-18:35.<br>
 <br>
         Journey through Perea to Jerusalem: <!-#-->Mr 10:1-52; Mt<br>
 19:1-20:34.<br>
 <br>
         Last week in Jerusalem: <!-#-->Mr 11:1-16:8; Mt 21:1-28:8.<br>
 <br>
         The Gospel of Matthew comes first in the New Testament,<br>
 though it is not so in all the Greek manuscripts. Because of its<br>
 position it is the book most widely read in the New Testament and<br>
 has exerted the greatest influence on the world. The book<br>
 deserves this influence though it is later in date than Mark, not<br>
 so beautiful as Luke, nor so profound as John. Yet it is a<br>
 wonderful book and gives a just and adequate portraiture of the<br>
 life and teachings of Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour. The<br>
 author probably wrote primarily to persuade Jews that Jesus is<br>
 the fulfilment of their Messianic hopes as pictured in the Old<br>
 Testament. It is thus a proper introduction to the New Testament<br>
 story in comparison with the Old Testament prophecy.<br>
 <br>
                                THE TITLE<br>
 <br>
         The Textus Receptus has "The Holy Gospel according to<br>
 Matthew" <b><i>(\to kata Matthaion hagion Euaggelion\)</i></b>, though the<br>
 Elzevirs omit "holy," not agreeing here with Stephanus,<br>
 Griesbach, and Scholz. Only minuscules <b><i>(cursive Greek<br>
 manuscripts)</i></b> and all late have the adjective. Other minuscules<br>
 and nine uncials including W <b><i>(the Washington Codex of the fifth<br>
 century)</i></b>, C of the fifth century <b><i>(the palimpsest manuscript)</i></b> and<br>
 Delta of the ninth together with most Latin manuscripts have<br>
 simply "Gospel according to Matthew" <b><i>(\Euaggelion kata<br>
 Matthaion\)</i></b>. But Aleph and B the two oldest and best Greek<br>
 uncials of the fourth century have only "According to Matthew"<br>
 <b><i>(\Kata Maththaion\)</i></b> <b><i>(note double th)</i></b> and the Greek uncial D of<br>
 the fifth or sixth century follows Aleph and B as do some of the<br>
 earliest Old Latin manuscripts and the Curetonian Syriac. It is<br>
 clear, therefore, that the earliest form of the title was simply<br>
 "According to Matthew." It may be doubted if Matthew <b><i>(or the<br>
 author, if not Matthew)</i></b> had any title at all. The use of<br>
 "according to" makes it plain that the meaning is not "the Gospel<br>
 of Matthew," but the Gospel as given by Matthew, \secundum<br>
 Matthaeum\, to distinguish the report by Matthew from that by<br>
 Mark, by Luke, by John. Least of all is there any authority in<br>
 the manuscripts for saying "Saint Matthew," a Roman Catholic<br>
 practice observed by some Protestants.<br>
 <br>
         The word Gospel <b><i>(\Euaggelion\)</i></b> comes to mean good news in<br>
 Greek, though originally a reward for good tidings as in Homer's<br>
 _Odyssey_ XIV. 152 and in <!-#-->2Ki 4:10. In the New Testament it is<br>
 the good news of salvation through Christ. The English word<br>
 Gospel probably comes from the Anglo-Saxon Godspell, story or<br>
 narrative of God, the life of Christ. It was early confused with<br>
 the Anglo-Saxon godspell, good story, which seems like a<br>
 translation of the Greek \euaggelion\. But primarily the English<br>
 word means the God story as seen in Christ which is the best news<br>
 that the world has ever had. One thinks at once of the use of<br>
 "word" <b><i>(\Logos\)</i></b> in <!-#-->Joh 1:1,14. So then it is, according to the<br>
 Greek, not the Good News of Matthew, but the Good News of God,<br>
 brought to us in Christ the Word, the Son of God, the Image of<br>
 the Father, the Message of the Father. We are to study this story<br>
 first as presented by Matthew. The message is God's and it is as<br>
 fresh to us today in Matthew's record as when he first wrote it.<br>
