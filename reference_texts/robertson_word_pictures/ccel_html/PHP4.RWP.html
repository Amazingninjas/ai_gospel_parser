<p>4:1 <B>{Longed for}</B> <b><i>(\epipoth&#275;toi\)</i></b>. Late and rare verbal adjective<br>
 <b><i>(here alone in N.T.)</i></b> from \epipothe&#333;\. <B>{So stand fast}</B> <b><i>(\houto<br>
 st&#275;kete\)</i></b>. Present active imperative of \st&#275;k&#333;\ <b><i>(late present<br>
 from perfect \hest&#275;ka\ from \hist&#275;mi\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->1:27. They were<br>
 tempted to defection. Standing firm is difficult when a panic<br>
 starts.<br>
 <br>
 4:2 <B>{Euodia}</B> <b><i>(\Euodian\)</i></b>. This name means literally "prosperous<br>
 journey" <b><i>(\eu, hodos\)</i></b>. It occurs in the inscriptions. <B>{Syntyche}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Suntuch&#275;n\)</i></b>. From \suntugchan&#333;\, to meet with and so "pleasant<br>
 acquaintance" or "good-luck." Occurs in the inscriptions and<br>
 identified with Lydia by some. Klopper suggests that each of<br>
 these rival women had church assemblies in their homes, one a<br>
 Jewish-Christian church, the other a Gentile-Christian church.<br>
 Vincent doubts the great influence of women in Macedonia held by<br>
 Lightfoot who also suggests that these two were ladies of rank or<br>
 perhaps deaconesses of the church in Philippi. Schinz suggests<br>
 that in such a pure church even slight bickerings would make a<br>
 real disturbance. "It may have been accidental friction between<br>
 two energetic Christian women" <b><i>(Kennedy)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:3 <B>{True yokefellow}</B> <b><i>(\gn&#275;sie sunzuge\)</i></b>. All sorts of<br>
 suggestions have been made here, one that it was Lydia who is<br>
 termed Paul's wife by the word \sunzuge\. Unfortunately for that<br>
 view \gn&#275;sie\ is masculine vocative singular. Some have suggested<br>
 it as a proper name though it is not found in the inscriptions,<br>
 but the word does occur as an appellative in one. Lightfoot even<br>
 proposes Epaphroditus, the bearer of the Epistle, certainly a<br>
 curious turn to take to address him. After all it matters little<br>
 that we do not know who the peacemaker was. <B>{Help these women}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sunlambanou autais\)</i></b>. Present middle imperative of<br>
 \sunlamban&#333;\, to seize <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 26:55)</i></b>, to conceive <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:24)</i></b>,<br>
 then to take hold together with one <b><i>(associative instrumental<br>
 case)</i></b>, to help as here <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 5:7)</i></b>. "Take hold with them." <B>{They<br>
 laboured with me}</B> <b><i>(\sun&#275;thl&#275;san moi\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of \sunathle&#333;\ <b><i>(for which see <!-#-->1:27)</i></b> with associative<br>
 instrumental case <b><i>(\moi\)</i></b>. <B>{With Clement also}</B> <b><i>(\meta kai<br>
 Kl&#275;mentos\)</i></b>. There is no evidence that he was Clement of Rome as<br>
 the name is common. <B>{In the book of life}</B> <b><i>(\en bibl&#333;i z&#333;&#275;s\)</i></b>. The<br>
 only instance of this expression in the N.T. outside of the<br>
 Apocalypse <b><i>(<!-#-->3:5; 13:8; 17:8, etc.)</i></b>. Hence real Christians in<br>
 spite of their bickerings.<br>
 <br>
 4:4 <B>{Again I will say}</B> <b><i>(\palin er&#333;\)</i></b>. Future active indicative of<br>
 defective verb \eipon\. <B>{Rejoice}</B> <b><i>(\chairete\)</i></b>. Present active<br>
 imperative as in <!-#-->3:1, repeated for emphasis in spite of<br>
 discouragements. Not in the sense of "Farewell" here.<br>
 <br>
 4:5 <B>{Your forbearance}</B> <b><i>(\to epieikes hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. "Your gentleness,"<br>
 "your sweet reasonableness" <b><i>(Matthew Arnold)</i></b>, "your moderation."<br>
 Old adjective <b><i>(\epi, eikos\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Jas 3:17; 1Ti 3:3. Article<br>
 and neuter singular here= \h&#275; epieikeia\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 24:4; 2Co 10:1)</i></b><br>
 like to \chr&#275;ston\ in <!-#-->Ro 2:4. <B>{The Lord is at hand}</B> <b><i>(\ho kurios<br>
 eggus\)</i></b>. "The Apostle's watchword" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>, as in <!-#-->1Co 16:22<br>
 <b><i>(\Maran atha\, Aramaic equivalent, Our Lord cometh)</i></b>. Unless,<br>
 indeed, \eggus\ here means near in space instead of <B>{nigh}</B> in<br>
 time.<br>
 <br>
 4:6 <B>{In nothing be anxious}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;den merimn&#257;te\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 imperative in prohibition, "stop being anxious." See \m&#275;<br>
 merimn&#257;te\ in <!-#-->Mt 6:31. <B>{With thanksgiving}</B> <b><i>(\meta<br>
 eucharistias\)</i></b>. In all the forms of prayer here named<br>
 thanksgiving should appear.<br>
 <br>
 4:7 <B>{The peace of God}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; eir&#275;n&#275; tou theou\)</i></b>. See in <!-#-->2Th 3:16<br>
 "the Lord of peace" <b><i>(\ho Kurios t&#275;s eir&#275;n&#275;s\)</i></b> and verse <!-#-->9 for<br>
 "the God of peace" <b><i>(\ho theos t&#275;s eir&#275;n&#275;s\)</i></b>. <B>{Shall guard}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\phrour&#275;sei\)</i></b>. "Shall garrison," future active indicative of<br>
 \phroure&#333;\, old verb from \phrouros\ <b><i>(\pro-horos, proora&#333;\, to<br>
 see before, to look out)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ac 9:24; 2Co 11:32. God's peace<br>
 as a sentinel mounts guard over our lives as Tennyson so<br>
 beautifully pictures Love as doing.<br>
 <br>
 4:8 <B>{Finally}</B> <b><i>(\to loipon\)</i></b>. See on &#175;3:1. <B>{Whatsoever}</B> <b><i>(\hosa\)</i></b>.<br>
 Thus he introduces six adjectives picturing Christian ideals,<br>
 old-fashioned and familiar words not necessarily from any<br>
 philosophic list of moral excellencies Stoic or otherwise.<br>
 Without these no ideals can exist. They are pertinent now when so<br>
 much filth is flaunted before the world in books, magazines and<br>
 moving-pictures under the name of realism <b><i>(the slime of the<br>
 gutter and the cess-pool)</i></b>. <B>{Honourable}</B> <b><i>(\semna\)</i></b>. Old word from<br>
 \seb&#333;\, to worship, revere. So revered, venerated <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 3:8)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Pure}</B> <b><i>(\hagna\)</i></b>. Old word for all sorts of purity. There are<br>
 clean things, thoughts, words, deeds. <B>{Lovely}</B> <b><i>(\prosphil&#275;\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 word, here only in N.T., from \pros\ and \phile&#333;\, pleasing,<br>
 winsome. <B>{Of good report}</B> <b><i>(\euph&#275;ma\. Old word, only here in<br>
 N.T., from \eu\ and \ph&#275;m&#275;\, fair-speaking, attractive.(</i></b> <B>{If there<br>
 be any}</B> <b><i>(\ei tis\)</i></b>. Paul changes the construction from \hosa\<br>
 <b><i>(whatsoever)</i></b> to a condition of the first class, as in <!-#-->2:1, with<br>
 two substantives. <B>{Virtue}</B> <b><i>(\aret&#275;\)</i></b>. Old word, possibly from<br>
 \aresk&#333;\, to please, used very often in a variety of senses by<br>
 the ancients for any mental excellence or moral quality or<br>
 physical power. Its very vagueness perhaps explains its rarity in<br>
 the N.T., only four times <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 4:8; 1Pe 2:9; 2Pe 1:3,5)</i></b>. It is<br>
 common in the papyri, but probably Paul is using it in the sense<br>
 found in the LXX <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 42:12; 43:21)</i></b> of God's splendour and<br>
 might <b><i>(Deissmann, _Bible Studies_, p. 95)</i></b> in connection with<br>
 "praise" <b><i>(\epainos\)</i></b> as here or even meaning praise. <B>{Think on<br>
 these things}</B> <b><i>(\tauta logizesthe\)</i></b>. Present middle imperative for<br>
 habit of thought. We are responsible for our thoughts and can<br>
 hold them to high and holy ideals.<br>
 <br>
 4:9 <B>{In me}</B> <b><i>(\en emoi\)</i></b>. Paul dares to point to his life in<br>
 Philippi as an illustration of this high thinking. The preacher<br>
 is the interpreter of the spiritual life and should be an example<br>
 of it. <B>{These things do}</B> <b><i>(\tauta prassete\)</i></b>. Practise as a habit<br>
 <b><i>(\prass&#333;\, not \poie&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:10 <B>{I rejoice}</B> <b><i>(\echar&#275;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive indicative of<br>
 \chair&#333;\, a timeless aorist. I did rejoice, I do rejoice.<br>
 <B>{Greatly}</B> <b><i>(\megal&#333;s\)</i></b>. Old adverb, only here in N.T., from<br>
 \megas\ <b><i>(great)</i></b>. <B>{Now at length}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;d&#275; pote\)</i></b>. In N.T. only here<br>
 and <!-#-->Ro 1:10. \Pote\ is indefinite past <b><i>(interval)</i></b>, \&#275;d&#275;\<br>
 immediate present. <B>{Ye have revived}</B> <b><i>(\anethalete\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active indicative of old poetic word <b><i>(Homer)</i></b>, \anathall&#333;\,<br>
 to sprout again, to shoot up, to blossom again. So in the LXX<br>
 five times, though rare and literary word. <B>{Your thought for me}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\to huper emou phronein\)</i></b>. Accusative case of the articular<br>
 present active infinitive the object of \anethalete\ used<br>
 transitively. "You caused your thinking of me to bloom afresh."<br>
 <B>{Wherein}</B> <b><i>(\eph' h&#333;i\)</i></b>. "In which," "upon which" <b><i>(locative case)</i></b>.<br>
 A loose reference to Paul's interests as involved in their<br>
 thinking of him. <B>{Ye did indeed take thought}</B> <b><i>(\kai ephroneite\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active, "ye were also <b><i>(or had been also)</i></b> thinking." <B>{Ye<br>
 lacked opportunity}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kaireisthe\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of<br>
 \akaireomai\, late and rare word, here only in N.T., from<br>
 \akairos\ <b><i>(\a\ privative, \kairos\)</i></b>, not to have a chance, the<br>
 opposite of \eukaire&#333;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 6:31)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:11 <B>{In respect of want}</B> <b><i>(\kath' huster&#275;sin\)</i></b>. Late and rare<br>
 word from \hustere&#333;\, to be behind or too late, only here and <!-#-->Mr<br>
 12:44 in N.T. <B>{I have learned}</B> <b><i>(\emathon\)</i></b>. Simply, "I did<br>
 learn" <b><i>(constative second aorist active indicative of \manthan&#333;\,<br>
 to learn, looking at his long experience as a unit)</i></b>. <B>{In<br>
 whatsoever state I am}</B> <b><i>(\en hois eimi\)</i></b>. "In what things<br>
 <b><i>(circumstances)</i></b> I am." <B>{To be content}</B> <b><i>(\autark&#275;s einai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Predicate nominative with the infinitive of the old adjective<br>
 \autark&#275;s\ <b><i>(from \autos\ and \arke&#333;\, to be self-sufficient)</i></b>,<br>
 self-sufficing. Favourite word with the Stoics, only here in<br>
 N.T., though \autarkeia\ occurs in <!-#-->2Co 9:8; 1Ti 6:6. Paul is<br>
 contented with his lot and he learned that lesson long ago.<br>
 Socrates said as to who is wealthiest: "He that is content with<br>
 least, for \autarkeia\ is nature's wealth."<br>
 <br>
 4:12 <B>{I know how}</B> <b><i>(\oida\)</i></b>. Followed by the infinitive \oida\ has<br>
 this sense. So here twice, with \tapeinousthai\, to be humbled,<br>
 from \tapeinos\, and with \perisseuein\, to overflow. <B>{Have I<br>
 learned the secret}</B> <b><i>(\memu&#275;mai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative of<br>
 \mue&#333;\, old and common word from \mu&#333;\, to close <b><i>(Latin _mutus_)</i></b>,<br>
 and so to initiate with secret rites, here only in N.T. The<br>
 common word \must&#275;rion\ <b><i>(mystery)</i></b> is from \must&#275;s\ <b><i>(one<br>
 initiated)</i></b> and this from \mue&#333;\, to initiate, to instruct in<br>
 secrets. Paul draws this metaphor from the initiatory rites of<br>
 the pagan mystery-religions. <B>{To be filled}</B> <b><i>(\chortazesthai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Old verb from \chortos\ <b><i>(grass, hay)</i></b> and so to fatten like an<br>
 animal. <B>{To be hungry}</B> <b><i>(\pein&#257;in\)</i></b>. Old verb from \peina\<br>
 <b><i>(hunger)</i></b> and kin to \pen&#275;s\, poor man who has to work for his<br>
 living <b><i>(\penomai\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:13 <B>{I can do all things}</B> <b><i>(\panta ischu&#333;\)</i></b>. Old verb to have<br>
 strength <b><i>(\ischus\)</i></b>. <B>{In him that strengtheneth me}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i<br>
 endunamounti me\)</i></b>. Late and rare verb <b><i>(in LXX)</i></b> from adjective<br>
 \endunamos\ <b><i>(\en, dunamis\)</i></b>. Causative verb to empower, to pour<br>
 power into one. See same phrase in <!-#-->1Ti 1:12 \t&#333;i endunam&#333;santi<br>
 me\ <b><i>(aorist tense here)</i></b>. Paul has such strength so long as Jesus<br>
 keeps on putting power <b><i>(\dunamis\)</i></b> into him.<br>
 <br>
 4:14 <B>{That ye had fellowship}</B> <b><i>(\sunkoin&#333;n&#275;santes\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active participle <b><i>(simultaneous action with the principal verb<br>
 \kal&#333;s epoi&#275;sate\)</i></b>. "Ye did well contributing for my affliction."<br>
 <br>
 4:15 <B>{In the beginning of the gospel}</B> <b><i>(\en arch&#275;i tou<br>
 euaggeliou\)</i></b>. After he had wrought in Philippi <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 2:13)</i></b>. <B>{Had<br>
 fellowship}</B> <b><i>(\ekoin&#333;n&#275;sen\)</i></b>. "Had partnership" <b><i>(first aorist<br>
 active indicative)</i></b>. <B>{In the matter}</B> <b><i>(\eis logon\)</i></b>. "As to an<br>
 account." No other church opened an account with Paul. <B>{Of giving<br>
 and receiving}</B> <b><i>(\dose&#333;s kai l&#275;mpse&#333;s\)</i></b>. Credit and debit. A<br>
 mercantile metaphor repeated in verse <!-#-->17 by \eis logon hum&#333;n\<br>
 <b><i>(to your account)</i></b>. Paul had to keep books then with no other<br>
 church, though later Thessalonica and Beroea joined Philippi in<br>
 support of Paul's work in Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:8f.)</i></b>. <B>{But ye only}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ei m&#275; humeis monoi\)</i></b>. Not even Antioch contributed anything but<br>
 good wishes and prayers for Paul's work <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 13:1-3)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:16 <B>{Once and again}</B> <b><i>(\kai hapax kai dis\)</i></b>. "Both once and<br>
 twice" they did it "even in Thessalonica" and so before Paul went<br>
 to Corinth." See the same Greek idiom in <!-#-->1Th 2:18.<br>
 <br>
 4:17 <B>{I seek for}</B> <b><i>(\epiz&#275;t&#333;\)</i></b>. Old verb, in N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 11:7 <b><i>(linear present, I am seeking for)</i></b>. Lightfoot calls it<br>
 "the Apostle's nervous anxiety to clear himself" of wanting more<br>
 gifts. Why not say his delicate courtesy?<br>
 <br>
 4:18 <B>{I have all things}</B> <b><i>(\apech&#333; panta\)</i></b>. As a receipt in full<br>
 in appreciation of their kindness. \Apech&#333;\ is common in the<br>
 papyri and the ostraca for "receipt in full" <b><i>(Deissmann, _Bible<br>
 Studies_, p. 110)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mt 6:2,5,16. <B>{I am filled}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pepl&#275;r&#333;mai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative of \pl&#275;ro&#333;\.<br>
 "Classical Greek would hardly use the word in this personal<br>
 sense" <b><i>(Kennedy)</i></b>. <B>{An odour of a sweet smell}</B> <b><i>(\osm&#275;n eu&#333;dias\)</i></b>.<br>
 \Osm&#275;\, old word from \oz&#333;\, to smell. \Eu&#333;dia\, old word from<br>
 \eu\ and \oz&#333;\. In <!-#-->Eph 5:2 both words come together as here and<br>
 in <!-#-->2Co 2:15 we have \eu&#333;dia\ <b><i>(only other N.T. example)</i></b> and in<br>
 verse <!-#-->2Co 2:16 \osm&#275;\ twice. \Eu&#333;dias\ here is genitive of<br>
 quality. <B>{Sacrifice}</B> <b><i>(\thusian\)</i></b>. Not the act, but the offering<br>
 as in <!-#-->Ro 12:1. <B>{Well-pleasing}</B> <b><i>(\euareston\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->Ro 12:1.<br>
 <br>
 4:19 <B>{According to his riches in glory}</B> <b><i>(\kata to ploutos autou<br>
 en dox&#275;i\)</i></b>. God has an abundant treasure in glory and will repay<br>
 the Philippians for what they have done for Paul. The spiritual<br>
 reward is what spurs men into the ministry and holds them to it.<br>
 <br>
 4:20 <B>{The glory}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; doxa\)</i></b>. "The doxology flows out of the joy<br>
 of the whole epistle" <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:21 <B>{They that are of Caesar's household}</B> <b><i>(\hoi ek t&#275;s Kaisaros<br>
 oikias\)</i></b>. Not members of the imperial family, but some connected<br>
 with the imperial establishment. The term can apply to slaves and<br>
 freedmen and even to the highest functionaries. Christianity has<br>
 begun to undermine the throne of the Caesars. Some day a<br>
 Christian will sit on this throne. The gospel works upward from<br>
 the lower classes. lt was so at Corinth and in Rome. It is true<br>
 today. It is doubtful if Nero had yet heard of Paul for his case<br>
 may have been dismissed by lapse of time. But this obscure<br>
 prisoner who has planted the gospel in Caesar's household has won<br>
 more eternal fame and power than all the Caesars combined. Nero<br>
 will commit suicide shortly after Paul has been executed. Nero's<br>
 star went down and Paul's rose and rises still.<br>
