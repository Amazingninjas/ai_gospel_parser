<p>1:1 <B>{Forasmuch as}</B> <b><i>(\epeid&#275;per\)</i></b>. Here alone in the N.T., though<br>
 common in literary Attic. Appears in the papyri. A triple<br>
 compound <b><i>(\epei\ = since, \d&#275;\ = admittedly true, \per\ =<br>
 intensive particle to emphasize importance)</i></b>. <B>{Many}</B> <b><i>(\polloi\)</i></b>.<br>
 How many no one knows, but certainly more than two or three. We<br>
 know that Luke used the Logia of Jesus written by Matthew in<br>
 Aramaic <b><i>(Papias)</i></b> and Mark's Gospel. Undoubtedly he had other<br>
 written sources. <B>{Have taken in hand}</B> <b><i>(\epecheir&#275;san\)</i></b>. A literal<br>
 translation of \epicheire&#333;\ <b><i>(from \cheir\, hand and \epi\, upon)</i></b>.<br>
 Both Hippocrates and Galen use this word in their introduction to<br>
 their medical works. Here only in the N.T., though a common<br>
 literary word. Common in the papyri for undertaking with no idea<br>
 of failure or blame. Luke does not mean to cast reflection on<br>
 those who preceded him. The apocryphal gospels were all much<br>
 later and are not in his mind. Luke had secured fuller<br>
 information and planned a book on a larger scale and did surpass<br>
 them with the result that they all perished save Mark's Gospel<br>
 and what Matthew and Luke possess of the Logia of Jesus. There<br>
 was still room for Luke's book. That motive influences every<br>
 author and thus progress is made. <B>{To draw up, a narrative}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anataxasthai di&#275;g&#275;sin\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist middle infinitive.<br>
 This verb \anataxasthai\ has been found only in Plutarch's<br>
 _Moral_. 968 CD about an elephant "rehearsing" by moonlight<br>
 certain tricks it had been taught <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan,<br>
 _Vocabulary_)</i></b>. That was from memory going regularly through the<br>
 thing again. But the idea in the word is plain enough. The word<br>
 is composed of \tass&#333;\, a common verb for arranging things in<br>
 proper order and \ana\, again. Luke means to say that those<br>
 before him had made attempts to rehearse in orderly fashion<br>
 various matters about Christ. "The expression points to a<br>
 connected series of narratives in some order <b><i>(\taxis\)</i></b>, topical<br>
 or chronological rather than to isolated narratives" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 "They had produced something more than mere notes or anecdotes"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. \Di&#275;g&#275;sis\ means leading or carrying a thing through,<br>
 not a mere incident. Galen applies this word some seventy-five<br>
 times to the writing of Hippocrates. <B>{Which have been fulfilled}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\t&#333;n pepl&#275;r&#333;phor&#275;men&#333;n\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle from<br>
 \pl&#275;rophore&#333;\ and that from \pl&#275;r&#275;s\ <b><i>(full)</i></b> and \pher&#333;\ <b><i>(to<br>
 bring)</i></b>. Hence to bring or make full. The verb is rare outside of<br>
 the LXX and the N.T. Papyri examples occur for finishing off a<br>
 legal matter or a financial matter in full. Deissmann <b><i>(_Light<br>
 from the Ancient East_, pp. 86f.)</i></b> gives examples from the papyri<br>
 and inscriptions for completing a task or being convinced or<br>
 satisfied in mind. The same ambiguity occurs here. When used of<br>
 persons in the N.T. the meaning is to be convinced, or fully<br>
 persuaded <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 4:21; 14:5; Heb 6:11; 10:22)</i></b>. When used of things<br>
 it has the notion of completing or finishing <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 4:5,17)</i></b>. Luke<br>
 is here speaking of "matters" <b><i>(\pragmat&#333;n\)</i></b>. Luke may refer to<br>
 the matters connected with Christ's life which have been brought<br>
 to a close among us or accomplished. Bruce argues plausibly that<br>
 he means fulness of knowledge "concerning the things which have<br>
 become widely known among us Christians." In <!-#-->Col 2:2 we have<br>
 "fulness of understanding" <b><i>(\t&#275;s pl&#275;rophorias t&#275;s sunese&#333;s\)</i></b>. In<br>
 modern Greek the verb means to inform. The careful language of<br>
 Luke here really pays a tribute to those who had preceded him in<br>
 their narratives concerning Christ.<br>
 <br>
 1:2 <B>{Even as}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s\)</i></b>. This particle was condemned by the<br>
 Atticists though occurring occasionally from Aristotle on. It is<br>
 in the papyri. Luke asserts that the previous narratives had<br>
 their sound basis. <B>{Delivered unto us}</B> <b><i>(\pared&#333;san h&#275;min\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist active indicative of \paradid&#333;mi\. Luke received<br>
 this tradition along with those who are mentioned above <b><i>(the<br>
 many)</i></b>. That is he was not one of the "eyewitnesses." He was a<br>
 secondary, not a primary, witness of the events. Tradition has<br>
 come to have a meaning of unreliability with us, but that is not<br>
 the idea here. Luke means to say that the handing down was<br>
 dependable, not mere wives' fables. Those who drew up the<br>
 narratives had as sources of knowledge those who handed down the<br>
 data. Here we have both written and oral sources. Luke had access<br>
 to both kinds. <B>{Which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and<br>
 ministers of the word}</B> <b><i>(\hoi ap' arch&#275;s autoptai kai hup&#275;retai<br>
 genomenoi tou logou\)</i></b>. "Who" is better than "which" for the<br>
 article here. The word for <B>{eyewitnesses}</B> <b><i>(\autoptai\)</i></b> is an old<br>
 Greek word and appears in the papyri also. It means seeing with<br>
 one's own eyes. It occurs here only in the N.T. We have the very<br>
 word in the medical term _autopsy_. Greek medical writers often<br>
 had the word. It is a different word from \epoptai\ <b><i>(eyewitness)</i></b><br>
 in <!-#-->2Pe 1:16, a word used of those who beheld heavenly<br>
 mysteries. The word for "ministers" <b><i>(\hup&#275;retai\)</i></b>, under rowers<br>
 or servants we have had already in <!-#-->Mt 5:25; 26:58; Mr 14:54,65,<br>
 which see. We shall see it again in <!-#-->Lu 4:20 of the attendant in<br>
 the synagogue. In the sense of a preacher of the gospel as here,<br>
 it occurs also in <!-#-->Ac 26:16. Here "the word" means the gospel<br>
 message, as in <!-#-->Ac 6:4; 8:4, etc. <B>{From the beginning}</B><br>
 apparently refers to the beginning of the ministry of Jesus as<br>
 was true of the apostles <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 1:22)</i></b> and of the early apostolic<br>
 preaching <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10:37-43)</i></b>. The Gospel of Mark follows this plan.<br>
 The Gospel of Luke goes behind this in chapters 1 and 2 as does<br>
 Matthew in chapters 1 and 2. But Luke is not here referring to<br>
 himself. The matters about the childhood of Jesus Christ would<br>
 not form part of the traditional preaching for obvious reasons.<br>
 <br>
 1:3 <B>{It seemed good to me also}</B> <b><i>(\edoxe kamoi\)</i></b>. A natural<br>
 conclusion and justification of Luke's decision to write his<br>
 narrative. They had ample reason to draw up their narratives.<br>
 Luke has more reason to do so because of his fuller knowledge and<br>
 wider scope. <B>{Having traced the course of all things}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\par&#275;kolouth&#275;koti p&#257;sin\)</i></b>. The perfect active participle of a<br>
 common verb of the ancient Greek. Literally it means to follow<br>
 along a thing in mind, to trace carefully. Both meanings occur<br>
 abundantly in the ancient Greek. Cadbury <b><i>(Appendix C to<br>
 _Beginnings of Christianity_, Vol. II, pp. 489ff.)</i></b> objects to the<br>
 translation "having traced" here as implying research which the<br>
 word does not here mean. Milligan <b><i>(_Vocabulary_)</i></b> is somewhat<br>
 impressed by this argument. See my discussion of the point in<br>
 Chapter XVI of _Studies in the Text of the N.T._ <b><i>(The<br>
 Implications in Luke's Preface)</i></b> where the point is made that Luke<br>
 here claims fulness of knowledge before he began to write his<br>
 book. He had the traditions of the eyewitnesses and ministers of<br>
 the word and the narratives previously drawn up. Whether he was a<br>
 personal contemporary with any or all of these events we do not<br>
 know and it is not particularly pertinent. He had _mentally_<br>
 followed along by the side of these events. Galen used this verb<br>
 for the investigation of symptoms. Luke got himself ready to<br>
 write before he began by full and accurate knowledge of the<br>
 subject. \Akrib&#333;s\ <b><i>(accurately)</i></b> means going into minute details,<br>
 from \akron\, the topmost point. And he did it <B>{from the first}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\an&#333;then\)</i></b>. He seems to refer to the matters in Chapters<br>
 <!-#-->1:5-2:52, the Gospel of the Infancy. <B>{In order}</B> <b><i>(\kathex&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Chronological order in the main following Mark's general outline.<br>
 But in <!-#-->9:51-18:10 the order is often topical. He has made<br>
 careful investigation and his work deserves serious<br>
 consideration. <B>{Most excellent Theophilus}</B> <b><i>(\kratiste<br>
 Theophile\)</i></b>. The name means god-lover or god-beloved. He may have<br>
 been a believer already. He was probably a Gentile. Ramsay holds<br>
 that "most excellent" was a title like "Your Excellency" and<br>
 shows that he held office, perhaps a Knight. So of Felix <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 23:26)</i></b> and Festus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 26:25)</i></b>. The adjective does not occur in<br>
 the dedication in <!-#-->Ac 1:1.<br>
 <br>
 1:4 <B>{Mightest know}</B> <b><i>(\epign&#333;is\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 subjunctive of \epigin&#333;sk&#333;\. Full knowledge <b><i>(\epi\-)</i></b>, in addition<br>
 to what he already has. <B>{The certainty}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n asphaleian\)</i></b>. Make<br>
 no slip <b><i>(\sphall&#333;\, to totter or fall, and \a\ privative)</i></b>. Luke<br>
 promises a reliable narrative. "Theophilus shall know that the<br>
 faith which he has embraced has an impregnable historical<br>
 foundation" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{The things}</B> <b><i>(\log&#333;n\)</i></b>. Literally "words,"<br>
 the details of the words in the instruction. <B>{Wast instructed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kat&#275;ch&#275;th&#275;s\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative. Not in O.T. and<br>
 rare in ancient Greek. Occurs in the papyri. The word \&#275;che&#333;\ is<br>
 our word echo <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1Th 1:8 for \ex&#275;ch&#275;tai\, has sounded forth)</i></b>.<br>
 \Kat&#275;che&#333;\ is to sound down, to din, to instruct, to give oral<br>
 instruction. Cf. <!-#-->1Co 14:9; Ac 21:21,24; 18:25; Gal 6:6. Those<br>
 men doing the teaching were called _catechists_ and those<br>
 receiving it were called _catechumens_. Whether Theophilus was<br>
 still a catechumen is not known. This Preface by Luke is in<br>
 splendid literary _Koin&#275;_ and is not surpassed by those in any<br>
 Greek writer <b><i>(Herodotus, Thucydides, Polybius)</i></b>. It is entirely<br>
 possible that Luke was familiar with this habit of Greek<br>
 historians to write prefaces since he was a man of culture.<br>
 <br>
 1:5 <B>{There was}</B> <b><i>(\egeneto\)</i></b>. Not the usual \en\ for "was," but<br>
 there arose or came into notice. With this verse the literary<br>
 _Koin&#275;_ of verses 1 to 4 disappears. To the end of chapter 2 we<br>
 have the most Hebraistic <b><i>(Aramaic)</i></b> passage in Luke's writings,<br>
 due evidently to the use of documents or notes of oral tradition.<br>
 Plummer notes a series of such documents ending with <!-#-->1:80, 2:40,<br>
 2:52. If the mother of Jesus was still alive, Luke could have<br>
 seen her. She may have written in Aramaic an account of these<br>
 great events. Natural reserve would keep her from telling too<br>
 much and from too early publicity. Luke, as a physician, would<br>
 take special interest in her birth report. The supernatural<br>
 aspects disturb only those who do not admit the real Incarnation<br>
 of Jesus Christ and who are unable to believe that God is<br>
 superior to nature and that the coming of the Son of God to earth<br>
 justifies such miraculous manifestations of divine power. Luke<br>
 tells his story from the standpoint of Mary as Matthew gives his<br>
 from the standpoint of Joseph. The two supplement each other. We<br>
 have here the earliest documentary evidence of the origins of<br>
 Christianity that has come down to us <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{Herod, King of<br>
 Judea}</B> <b><i>(\H&#275;r&#333;idou basile&#333;s t&#275;s Ioudaias\)</i></b>. This note of time<br>
 locates the events before the death of Herod the Great <b><i>(as he was<br>
 called later)</i></b>, appointed King of Judea by the Roman Senate B.C.<br>
 40 at the suggestion of Octavius and Antony. He died B.C. 4. <B>{Of<br>
 the course of Abijah}</B> <b><i>(\ex eph&#275;merias Abia\)</i></b>. Not in old Greek,<br>
 but in LXX and modern Greek. Papyri have a verb derived from it,<br>
 \eph&#275;mere&#333;\. Daily service <b><i>(<!-#-->Ne 13:30; 1Ch 25:8)</i></b> and then a<br>
 course of priests who were on duty for a week <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ch 23:6;<br>
 28:13)</i></b>. There were 24 such courses and that of Abijah was the<br>
 eighth <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ch 24:10; 2Ch 8:14)</i></b>. Only four of these courses<br>
 <b><i>(Jedaiah, Immer, Pashur, Harim)</i></b> returned from Babylon, but these<br>
 four were divided into twenty-four with the old names. Each of<br>
 these courses did duty for eight days, sabbath to sabbath, twice<br>
 a year. On sabbaths the whole course did duty. At the feast of<br>
 tabernacles all twenty-four courses were present. <B>{Of the<br>
 daughters of Aaron}</B> <b><i>(\ek t&#333;n thugater&#333;n Aar&#333;n\)</i></b>. "To be a priest<br>
 and married to a priest's daughter was a double distinction"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. Like a preacher married to a preacher's daughter.<br>
 <br>
 1:6 <B>{Righteous before God}</B> <b><i>(\dikaioi enantion tou theou\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 Testament conception and idiom. Cf. <!-#-->2:25 about Simeon. Expanded<br>
 in Old Testament language. Picture of "noblest product of Old<br>
 Testament education" <b><i>(Ragg)</i></b> is Zacharias and Elisabeth, Mary and<br>
 Joseph, Simeon and Anna who were "privileged to see with clear<br>
 eyes the dawn of the New Testament revelation."<br>
 <br>
 1:7 <B>{Because that}</B> <b><i>(\kathoti\)</i></b>. Good Attic word, according to<br>
 what. Only in Luke and Acts in the N.T. In the papyri. <B>{Well<br>
 stricken in years}</B> <b><i>(\probeb&#275;kotes en tais h&#275;merais aut&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Wycliff has it right: "Had gone far in their days." Perfect<br>
 active participle. See also verse <!-#-->18.<br>
 <br>
 1:8 <B>{While he executed the priest's office}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i hierateuein<br>
 auton\)</i></b>. A favourite idiom in Luke, \en\ with the articular<br>
 infinitive and the accusative of general reference where the<br>
 genitive absolute could have been used or a temporal conjunction<br>
 and finite verb. It is proper Greek, but occurs often in the LXX,<br>
 which Luke read, particularly in imitation of the Hebrew<br>
 infinitive construct. The word \hierateu&#333;\ does not appear in the<br>
 ancient Greek, but in the LXX and this one example in Luke. It is<br>
 on the Rosetta Stone and the early inscriptions so that the word<br>
 was simply applied by the LXX translators from current usage.<br>
 <br>
 1:9 <B>{His lot was}</B> <b><i>(\elache\)</i></b>. Literally, <B>{he obtained the lot}</B>.<br>
 Second aorist active indicative of \lagchan&#333;\, to obtain by lot,<br>
 a very old verb from Homer on. It is used either with the<br>
 genitive as here, or the accusative as in <!-#-->Ac 1:17; 2Pe 1:1.<br>
 Papyri show examples with the accusative. It was only once in a<br>
 lifetime that a priest obtained the lot of going <b><i>(\eiselth&#333;n\,<br>
 here nominative aorist active participle agreeing with the<br>
 subject of \elache\)</i></b> into the sanctuary <b><i>(\ton naon\, not \to<br>
 hieron\, the outer courts)</i></b> and burning incense on the golden<br>
 altar. "It was the great moment of Zacharias's life, and his<br>
 heart was no doubt alert for the supernatural" <b><i>(Ragg)</i></b>. The<br>
 fortunate lot was "a white stone" to which <!-#-->Re 2:17 may refer.<br>
 <B>{Burn incense}</B> <b><i>(\tou thumiasai\)</i></b>. Here only in the N.T. Occurs on<br>
 inscriptions. Hobart finds it used by medical writers for<br>
 fumigating herbs. "Ascending the steps to the Holy Place, the<br>
 priests spread the coals on the golden altar, and arranged the<br>
 incense, and the chief operating priest was then left alone<br>
 within the Holy Place to await the signal of the president to<br>
 burn the incense. It was probably at this time that the angel<br>
 appeared to Zacharias" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:10 <B>{Were praying without}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n proseuchomenon ex&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic imperfect indicative picturing the posture of the<br>
 people while the clouds of incense rose on the inside of the<br>
 sanctuary.<br>
 <br>
 1:11 <B>{Appeared}</B> <b><i>(\&#333;phth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative. It<br>
 is the form used by Paul of the resurrection appearances of Jesus<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:5-8)</i></b>. There is no use in trying to explain away the<br>
 reality of the angel. We must choose between admitting an<br>
 objective appearance and a myth <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:13 <B>{Is heard}</B> <b><i>(\eis&#275;kousth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative.<br>
 A sort of timeless aorist, "was heard" when made, and so "is<br>
 heard" now. Probably the prayer was for a son in spite of the<br>
 great age of Elisabeth, though the Messianic redemption is<br>
 possible also. <B>{John}</B> <b><i>(\I&#333;an&#275;n\)</i></b>. The word means that God is<br>
 gracious. The mention of the name should have helped Zacharias to<br>
 believe. The message of the angel <b><i>(verses <!-#-->13-17)</i></b> takes on a<br>
 metrical form when turned into Hebrew <b><i>(Ragg)</i></b> and it is a prose<br>
 poem in Greek and English like <!-#-->1:30-33,35-37,42-45,46-55,68-70;<br>
 2:10-12,14,29-32,34-35. Certainly Luke has preserved the<br>
 earliest Christian hymns in their oldest sources. He is the first<br>
 critic of the sources of the Gospels and a scholarly one.<br>
 <br>
 1:14 <B>{Gladness}</B> <b><i>(\agalliasis\)</i></b>. Only in the LXX and N.T. so far<br>
 as known. A word for extreme exultation. <B>{Rejoice}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\char&#275;sontai\)</i></b>. Second future passive indicative. The coming of<br>
 a prophet will indeed be an occasion for rejoicing.<br>
 <br>
 1:15 <B>{Strong drink}</B> <b><i>(\sikera\)</i></b>. A Hebrew word transliterated into<br>
 Greek, an intoxicating drink. Here only in the N.T. John was to<br>
 be a personal "dry" or Nazarite <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 6:3)</i></b>. <B>{Shall not drink}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ou m&#275; pi&#275;i\)</i></b>. Strong prohibition, double negative and second<br>
 aorist subjunctive. <B>{The Holy Ghost}</B> <b><i>(\pneumatos hagiou\)</i></b>. The<br>
 Holy Spirit in contrast to the physical excitement of strong<br>
 drink <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. Luke uses this phrase 53 times, 12 in the<br>
 Gospel, Mark and John 4 each, Matthew 5 times. <B>{Even from his<br>
 mother's womb}</B> <b><i>(\eti ek koilias m&#275;tros autou\)</i></b>. A manifest<br>
 Hebraism. Cf. verse <!-#-->41.<br>
 <br>
 1:17 <B>{Before his face}</B> <b><i>(\en&#333;pion autou\)</i></b>. Not in the ancient<br>
 Greek, but common in the papyri as in LXX and N.T. It is a<br>
 vernacular _Koin&#275;_ word, adverb used as preposition from<br>
 adjective \en&#333;pios\, and that from \ho en &#333;pi &#333;n\ <b><i>(the one who is<br>
 in sight)</i></b>. <B>{Autou}</B> here seems to be "the Lord their God" in verse<br>
 <!-#-->16 since the Messiah has not yet been mentioned, though he was<br>
 to be actually the Forerunner of the Messiah. <B>{In the spirit and<br>
 power of Elijah}</B> <b><i>(\en pneumati kai dunamei Elei&#257;\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Isa<br>
 40:1-11; Mal 3:1-5. John will deny that he is actually Elijah in<br>
 person, as they expected <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:21)</i></b>, but Jesus will call him<br>
 Elijah in spirit <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 9:12; Mt 17:12)</i></b>. <B>{Hearts of fathers}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kardias pater&#333;n\)</i></b>. Paternal love had died out. This is one of<br>
 the first results of conversion, the revival of love in the home.<br>
 <B>{Wisdom}</B> <b><i>(\phron&#275;sei\)</i></b>. Not \sophia\, but a word for practical<br>
 intelligence. <B>{Prepared}</B> <b><i>(\kateskeuasmenon\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle, state of readiness for Christ. This John did. This is<br>
 a marvellous forecast of the character and career of John the<br>
 Baptist, one that should have caught the faith of Zacharias.<br>
 <br>
 1:18 <B>{Whereby}</B> <b><i>(\kata ti\)</i></b>. According to what. It was too good to<br>
 be true and Zacharias demanded proof and gives the reason <b><i>(for,<br>
 \gar\)</i></b> for his doubt. He had prayed for this blessing and was now<br>
 sceptical like the disciples in the house of Mary about the<br>
 return of Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 12:14f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:19 <B>{Gabriel}</B> <b><i>(\Gabri&#275;l\)</i></b>. The Man of God <b><i>(<!-#-->Da 8:6; 9:21)</i></b>. The<br>
 other angel whose name is given in Scripture is Michael <b><i>(<!-#-->Da<br>
 10:13,21; Jude 1:9; Re 12:7)</i></b>. The description of himself is a<br>
 rebuke to the doubt of Zacharias.<br>
 <br>
 1:20 <B>{Thou shalt be silent}</B> <b><i>(\es&#275;i si&#333;p&#333;n\)</i></b>. Volitive future<br>
 periphrastic. <B>{Not able to speak}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; dunamenos lal&#275;sai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Negative repetition of the same statement. His dumbness will<br>
 continue "until" <b><i>(\achri h&#275;s h&#275;meras\)</i></b> the events come to pass<br>
 "because" <b><i>(\anth' h&#333;n\)</i></b>. The words were to become reality in due<br>
 season <b><i>(\kairon\, not \chronos\, time)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:21 <B>{Were waiting}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n prosdok&#333;n\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect<br>
 again. An old Greek verb for expecting. Appears in papyri and<br>
 inscriptions. It denotes mental direction whether hope or fear.<br>
 <B>{They marvelled}</B> <b><i>(\ethaumazon\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense, were wondering.<br>
 The Talmud says that the priest remained only a brief time in the<br>
 sanctuary. <B>{While he tarried}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i chronizein\)</i></b>. See verse<br>
 <!-#-->8 for the same idiom.<br>
 <br>
 1:22 <B>{Perceived}</B> <b><i>(\epegn&#333;san\)</i></b>. Second aorist indicative. Clearly<br>
 knew because he was not able to pronounce the benediction from<br>
 the steps <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 6:24-26)</i></b>. <B>{Continued making signs}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n<br>
 dianeu&#333;n\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect again. He nodded and beckoned<br>
 back and forth <b><i>(\dia\, between)</i></b>. Further proof of a vision that<br>
 caused his dumbness.<br>
 <br>
 1:23 <B>{Ministration}</B> <b><i>(\leitourgias\)</i></b>. Our word liturgy. A common<br>
 word in ancient Greek for public service, work for the people<br>
 <b><i>(\le&#333;s ergon\)</i></b>. It is common in the papyri for the service of the<br>
 Egyptian priesthood as we see it in the LXX of Hebrew priests<br>
 <b><i>(see also <!-#-->Heb 8:6; 9:21; 2Co 9:12; Php 2:17,30)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:24 <B>{Conceived}</B> <b><i>(\sunelaben\)</i></b>. Luke uses this word eleven times<br>
 and it occurs only five other times in the N.T. It is a very old<br>
 and common Greek word. He alone in the N.T. has it for conceiving<br>
 offspring <b><i>(<!-#-->1:24,31,36; 2:21)</i></b> though <!-#-->Jas 1:15 uses it of lust<br>
 producing sin. Hobart <b><i>(_Medical Language of Luke_, p. 91)</i></b><br>
 observes that Luke has almost as many words for pregnancy and<br>
 barrenness as Hippocrates <b><i>(\en gastri echein\, <!-#-->21:23; \egkuos\,<br>
 <!-#-->2:5; \steira\, <!-#-->1:7; \ateknos\, <!-#-->20:28)</i></b>. <B>{Hid}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\periekruben\)</i></b>. Only here in the N.T., but in late _Koin&#275;_<br>
 writers. Usually considered second aorist active indicative from<br>
 \perikrupt&#333;\, though it may be the imperfect indicative of a late<br>
 form \perikrub&#333;\. If it is aorist it is the constative aorist.<br>
 The preposition \peri\ makes it mean completely <b><i>(on all sides)</i></b><br>
 hid.<br>
 <br>
 1:25 <B>{My reproach}</B> <b><i>(\oneidos mou\)</i></b>. Keenly felt by a Jewish wife<br>
 because the husband wanted an heir and because of the hope of the<br>
 Messiah, and because of the mother's longing for a child.<br>
 <br>
 1:26 <B>{Was sent}</B> <b><i>(\apestal&#275;\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive indicative of<br>
 \apostell&#333;\ from which _apostle_ comes. The angel Gabriel is<br>
 God's messenger to Mary as to Zacharias <b><i>(<!-#-->1:19)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:27 <B>{Betrothed}</B> <b><i>(\emn&#275;steumen&#275;n\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle.<br>
 Betrothal usually lasted a year and unfaithfulness on the part of<br>
 the bride was punished with death <b><i>(<!-#-->De 23:24f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:28 <B>{Highly favoured}</B> <b><i>(\kecharit&#333;men&#275;\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle of \charito&#333;\ and means endowed with grace <b><i>(\charis\)</i></b>,<br>
 enriched with grace as in <!-#-->Eph 1:6, _non ut mater gratiae, sed<br>
 ut filia gratiae_ <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>. The Vulgate _gratiae plena_ "is<br>
 right, if it means 'full of grace _which thou hast received_';<br>
 wrong, if it means 'full of grace _which thou hast to bestow_"'<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. The oldest MSS. do not have "Blessed art thou among<br>
 women" here, but in verse <!-#-->42.<br>
 <br>
 1:29 <B>{Cast in her mind}</B> <b><i>(\dielogizeto\)</i></b>. Imperfect indicative.<br>
 Note aorist \dietarachth&#275;\. Common verb for reckoning up<br>
 different reasons. She was both upset and puzzled.<br>
 <br>
 1:30 <B>{Favour}</B> <b><i>(\charin\)</i></b>. Grace. Same root as \chair&#333;\ <b><i>(rejoice)</i></b><br>
 and \charito&#333;\ in verse <!-#-->28. To find favour is a common O.T.<br>
 phrase. \Charis\ is a very ancient and common word with a variety<br>
 of applied meanings. They all come from the notion of sweetness,<br>
 charm, loveliness, joy, delight, like words of grace, <!-#-->Lu 4:22,<br>
 growing grace, <!-#-->Eph 4:29, with grace, <!-#-->Col 4:6. The notion of<br>
 kindness is in it also, especially of God towards men as here. It<br>
 is a favourite word for Christianity, the Gospel of the grace of<br>
 God <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:24)</i></b> in contrast with law or works <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:16)</i></b>.<br>
 Gratitude is expressed also <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:32)</i></b>, especially to God <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro<br>
 6:17)</i></b>. <B>{With God}</B> <b><i>(\para t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>. Beside God.<br>
 <br>
 1:31 <B>{Conceive in thy womb}</B> <b><i>(\sull&#275;mps&#275;i en gastri\)</i></b>. Adding \en<br>
 gastri\ to the verb of <!-#-->1:24. Same idiom in <!-#-->Isa 7:14 of<br>
 Immanuel. <B>{Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. As to Joseph in <!-#-->Mt 1:21, but<br>
 without the explanation of the meaning. See on Matthew.<br>
 <br>
 1:32 <B>{The Son of the Most High}</B> <b><i>(\huios Hupsistou\)</i></b>. There is no<br>
 article in the Greek, but the use of Most High in verse <!-#-->35<br>
 clearly of God as here. In <!-#-->Lu 6:35 we find "sons of the Most<br>
 High" <b><i>(\huioi Hupsistou\)</i></b> so that we cannot insist on deity here,<br>
 though that is possible. The language of <!-#-->2Sa 7:14; Isa 9:7 is<br>
 combined here.<br>
 <br>
 1:33 <B>{Shall be no end}</B> <b><i>(\ouk estai telos\)</i></b>. Luke reports the<br>
 perpetuity of this Davidic kingdom over the house of Jacob with<br>
 no Pauline interpretation of the spiritual Israel though that was<br>
 the true meaning as Luke knew. Joseph was of the house of David<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:27)</i></b> and Mary also apparently <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:5)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:35 <B>{Shall overshadow thee}</B> <b><i>(\episkiasei\)</i></b>. A figure of a cloud<br>
 coming upon her. Common in ancient Greek in the sense of<br>
 obscuring and with accusative as of Peter's shadow in <!-#-->Ac 5:15.<br>
 But we have seen it used of the shining bright cloud at the<br>
 Transfiguration of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 17:5; Mr 9:7; Lu 9:34)</i></b>. Here it is<br>
 like the Shekinah glory which suggests it <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 40:38)</i></b> where the<br>
 cloud of glory represents the presence and power of God. <B>{Holy,<br>
 the Son of God}</B> <b><i>(\Hagion huios theou\)</i></b>. Here again the absence of<br>
 the article makes it possible for it to mean "Son of God." See<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 5:9. But this title, like the Son of Man <b><i>(\Ho huios tou<br>
 anthr&#333;pou\)</i></b> was a recognized designation of the Messiah. Jesus<br>
 did not often call himself Son of God <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:43)</i></b>, but it is<br>
 assumed in his frequent use of the Father, the Son <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 11:27; Lu<br>
 10:21; Joh 5:19ff.)</i></b>. It is the title used by the Father at the<br>
 baptism <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 3:22)</i></b> and on the Mount of Transfiguration <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 9:35)</i></b>. The wonder of Mary would increase at these words. The<br>
 Miraculous Conception or Virgin Birth of Jesus is thus plainly<br>
 set forth in Luke as in Matthew. The fact that Luke was a<br>
 physician gives added interest to his report.<br>
 <br>
 1:36 <B>{Kinswoman}</B> <b><i>(\suggenis\)</i></b>. Not necessarily cousin, but simply<br>
 relative.<br>
 <br>
 1:37 <B>{No word}</B> <b><i>(\ouk rh&#275;ma\)</i></b>. \Rh&#275;ma\ brings out the single item<br>
 rather than the whole content <b><i>(\logos\)</i></b>. So in verse <!-#-->38.<br>
 <br>
 1:39 <B>{Arose}</B> <b><i>(\anast&#257;sa\)</i></b>. Luke is very fond of this word, sixty<br>
 times against twenty-two in the rest of the N.T. <B>{Into the hill<br>
 country}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n orin&#275;n\)</i></b>. Luke uses this adjective twice in<br>
 this context <b><i>(here and <!-#-->1:65)</i></b> instead of \to oros\, the<br>
 mountains. It is an old word and is in the LXX, but nowhere else<br>
 in the N.T. The name of the city where Zacharias lived is not<br>
 given unless Judah here means Juttah <b><i>(<!-#-->Jos 15:55)</i></b>. Hebron was<br>
 the chief city of this part of Judea.<br>
 <br>
 1:40 <B>{Saluted}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;spasato\)</i></b>. Her first glance at Elisabeth showed<br>
 the truth of the angel's message. The two mothers had a bond of<br>
 sympathy.<br>
 <br>
 1:41 <B>{Leaped}</B> <b><i>(\eskirt&#275;sen\)</i></b>. A common enough incident with<br>
 unborn children <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 25:22)</i></b>, but Elisabeth was filled with the<br>
 Holy Spirit to understand what had happened to Mary.<br>
 <br>
 1:42 <B>{With a loud cry}</B> <b><i>(\kraug&#275;i megal&#275;i\)</i></b>. A moment of ecstatic<br>
 excitement. <B>{Blessed art thou}</B> <b><i>(\eulog&#275;men&#275;\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle. A Hebraistic equivalent for the superlative.<br>
 <br>
 1:43 <B>{The mother of my Lord}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; m&#275;t&#275;r tou Kuriou mou\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ps<br>
 110:1. Only by the help of the Holy Spirit could Elisabeth know<br>
 that Mary was to be the mother of the Messiah.<br>
 <br>
 1:45 <B>{For}</B> <b><i>(\hoti\)</i></b>. It is not certain whether \hoti\ here is<br>
 "that" or "because." It makes good sense either way. See also<br>
 <!-#-->7:16. This is the first beatitude in the New Testament and it<br>
 is similar to the last one in the Gospels spoken to Thomas to<br>
 discourage his doubt <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 20:29)</i></b>. Elisabeth wishes Mary to have<br>
 full faith in the prophecy of the angel. This song of Elisabeth<br>
 is as real poetry as is that of Mary <b><i>(<!-#-->1:47-55)</i></b> and Zacharias<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1:68-70)</i></b>. All three spoke under the power of the Holy Spirit.<br>
 These are the first New Testament hymns and they are very<br>
 beautiful. Plummer notes four strophes in Mary's Magnificat<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->46-48,<!-#-->49,50,<!-#-->51-53,<!-#-->54,55)</i></b>. Every idea here occurs in the<br>
 Old Testament, showing that Mary's mind was full of the spiritual<br>
 message of God's word.<br>
 <br>
 1:46 <B>{Doth magnify}</B> <b><i>(\megalunei\)</i></b>. Latin, _magnificat_. Harnack<br>
 argues that this is also the song of Elisabeth because a few<br>
 Latin MSS. have it so, but Mary is correct. She draws her<br>
 material from the O.T. and sings in the noblest strain.<br>
 <br>
 1:47 <B>{Hath rejoiced}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;galliasen\)</i></b>. This is aorist active<br>
 indicative. Greek tenses do not correspond to those in English.<br>
 The verb \agallia&#333;\ is a Hellenistic word from the old Greek<br>
 \agall&#333;\. It means to exult. See the substantive \agalliasis\ in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 1:14,44. Mary is not excited like Elisabeth, but breathes a<br>
 spirit of composed rapture. <B>{My spirit}</B> <b><i>(\to pneuma mou\)</i></b>. One<br>
 need not press unduly the difference between "soul" <b><i>(\psuch&#275;\)</i></b> in<br>
 verse <!-#-->46 and "spirit" here. Bruce calls them synonyms in<br>
 parallel clauses. Vincent argues that the soul is the principle<br>
 of individuality while the spirit is the point of contact between<br>
 God and man. It is doubtful, however, if the trichotomous theory<br>
 of man <b><i>(body, soul, and spirit)</i></b> is to be insisted on. It is<br>
 certain that we have an inner spiritual nature for which various<br>
 words are used in <!-#-->Mr 12:30. Even the distinction between<br>
 intellect, emotions, and will is challenged by some<br>
 psychologists. <B>{God my Saviour}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i the&#333;i t&#333;i sot&#275;ri mou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Article with each substantive. God is called Saviour in the O.T.<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->De 32:15, Ps 24:5; 95:1)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:48 <B>{The low estate}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n tapein&#333;sin\)</i></b>. The bride of a<br>
 carpenter and yet to be the mother of the Messiah. Literal sense<br>
 here as in <!-#-->1:52. <B>{Shall call me blessed}</B> <b><i>(\makariousin me\)</i></b>.<br>
 So-called Attic future of an old verb, to felicitate. Elisabeth<br>
 had already given her a beatitude <b><i>(\makaria\, <!-#-->1:45)</i></b>. Another<br>
 occurs in <!-#-->11:27. But this is a very different thing from the<br>
 worship of Mary <b><i>(Mariolatry)</i></b> by Roman Catholics. See my _The<br>
 Mother of Jesus: Her Problems and Her Glory_.<br>
 <br>
 1:50 <B>{Fear}</B> <b><i>(\phoboumenois\)</i></b>. Dative of the present middle<br>
 participle. Here it is reverential fear as in <!-#-->Ac 10:2; Col<br>
 3:22. The bad sense of dread appears in <!-#-->Mt 21:46; Mr 6:20; Lu<br>
 12:4.<br>
 <br>
 1:51 <B>{Showed strength}</B> <b><i>(\epoi&#275;sen kratos\)</i></b>. "Made might"<br>
 <b><i>(Wycliff)</i></b>. A Hebrew conception as in <!-#-->Ps 118:15. Plummer notes<br>
 six aorist indicatives in this sentence <b><i>(<!-#-->51-63)</i></b>, neither<br>
 corresponding to our English idiom, which translates here by<br>
 "hath" each time. <B>{Imagination}</B> <b><i>(\dianoi&#257;i\)</i></b>. Intellectual<br>
 insight, moral understanding.<br>
 <br>
 1:52 <B>{Princes}</B> <b><i>(\dunastas\)</i></b>. Our word dynasty is from this word.<br>
 It comes from \dunamai\, to be able.<br>
 <br>
 1:54 <B>{Hath holpen}</B> <b><i>(\antelabeto\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle<br>
 indicative. A very common verb. It means to lay hold of with a<br>
 view to help or succour. <B>{Servant}</B> <b><i>(\paidos\)</i></b>. Here it means<br>
 "servant," not "son" or "child," its usual meaning.<br>
 <br>
 1:58 <B>{Had magnified}</B> <b><i>(\emegalunen\)</i></b>. Aorist active indicative.<br>
 Same verb as in verse <!-#-->46. <B>{Rejoiced with her}</B> <b><i>(\sunechairon<br>
 aut&#275;i\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense and pictures the continual joy of the<br>
 neighbours, accented also by \sun-\ <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Php 2:18)</i></b> in its<br>
 mutual aspect.<br>
 <br>
 1:59 <B>{Would have called}</B> <b><i>(\ekaloun\)</i></b>. Conative imperfect, tried<br>
 to call.<br>
 <br>
 1:62 <B>{Made signs}</B> <b><i>(\eneneuon\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense, repeated action<br>
 as usual when making signs. In <!-#-->1:22 the verb used of Zacharias<br>
 is \dianeu&#333;n\. <B>{What he would have him called}</B> <b><i>(\to ti an theloi<br>
 kaleisthai auto\)</i></b>. Note article \to\ with the indirect question,<br>
 accusative of general reference. The optative with \an\ is here<br>
 because it was used in the direct question <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ac 17:18)</i></b>, and<br>
 is simply retained in the indirect. <B>{What would he wish him to be<br>
 called?}</B> <b><i>(<B>{if he could speak}</B>)</i></b>, a conclusion of the fourth-class<br>
 condition.<br>
 <br>
 1:63 <B>{Tablet}</B> <b><i>(\pinakidion\)</i></b>. Diminutive of \pinakis\. In<br>
 Aristotle and the papyri for writing tablet, probably covered<br>
 with wax. Sometimes it was a little table, like Shakespeare's<br>
 "the table of my memory" <b><i>(Hamlet, i.5)</i></b>. It was used also of a<br>
 physician's note-book. <B>{Wrote, saying}</B> <b><i>(\egrapsen leg&#333;n\)</i></b>. Hebrew<br>
 way of speaking <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ki 10:6)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:64 <B>{Immediately}</B> <b><i>(\parachr&#275;ma\)</i></b>. Nineteen times in the N.T.,<br>
 seventeen in Luke. <B>{Opened}</B> <b><i>(\ane&#333;ichth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative with double augment. The verb suits "mouth," but not<br>
 "tongue" <b><i>(\gl&#333;ssa\)</i></b>. It is thus a zeugma with tongue. Loosed or<br>
 some such verb to be supplied.<br>
 <br>
 1:65 <B>{Fear}</B> <b><i>(\phobos\)</i></b>. Not terror, but religious awe because of<br>
 contact with the supernatural as in the case of Zacharias<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1:12)</i></b>. Were noised abroad <b><i>(\dielaleito\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive.<br>
 Occurs in Polybius. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 6:11. It was<br>
 continuous talk back and forth between <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> the people.<br>
 <br>
 1:66 <B>{What then}</B> <b><i>(\ti ara\)</i></b>. With all these supernatural<br>
 happenings they predicted the marvellous career of this child.<br>
 Note \Ti\, <B>{what}</B>, not \Tis\, <B>{who}</B>. Cf. <!-#-->Ac 12:18. <B>{They laid<br>
 them up}</B> <b><i>(\ethento\, second aorist middle indicative)</i></b> as Mary did<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2:19)</i></b>. <B>{The hand of the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\cheir Kuriou\)</i></b>. Luke's<br>
 explanation in addition to the supernatural events. The<br>
 expression occurs only in Luke's writing <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:21; 13:11)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:67 <B>{Prophesied}</B> <b><i>(\eproph&#275;teusen\)</i></b>. Under the guidance of the<br>
 Holy Spirit. This _Benedictus_ <b><i>(\Eulog&#275;tos\, <B>{Blessed}</B>)</i></b> of<br>
 Zacharias <b><i>(<!-#-->68-79)</i></b> may be what is referred to in verse <!-#-->64 "he<br>
 began to speak blessing God" <b><i>(\eulog&#333;n\)</i></b>. Nearly every phrase<br>
 here is found in the O.T. <b><i>(Psalms and Prophets)</i></b>. He, like Mary,<br>
 was full of the Holy Spirit and had caught the Messianic message<br>
 in its highest meaning.<br>
 <br>
 1:68 <B>{Hath visited}</B> <b><i>(\epeskepsato\)</i></b>. An old Greek word with a<br>
 Hebraic colouring to look into with a view to help. The papyri<br>
 have plenty of examples of the verb in the sense of inspecting,<br>
 examining. <B>{Redemption}</B> <b><i>(\lutr&#333;sin\)</i></b> here originally referred to<br>
 political redemption, but with a moral and spiritual basis<br>
 <b><i>(verses <!-#-->75,77)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:69 <B>{Horn of salvation}</B> <b><i>(\keras s&#333;t&#275;rias\)</i></b>. A common metaphor in<br>
 the O.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->1Sa 2:10; 2Sa 23:3, etc.)</i></b>. It represents strength<br>
 like the horns of bulls. Cf. <!-#-->Ps. 132:17.<br>
 <br>
 1:70 <B>{Since the world began}</B> <b><i>(\ap' ai&#333;nos\)</i></b>. Better "from of old"<br>
 <b><i>(Weymouth, American Revision)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:73 <B>{The oath which he sware}</B> <b><i>(\horkon hon &#333;mosen\)</i></b>. Antecedent<br>
 attracted to case of the relative. The oath appears in <!-#-->Ge<br>
 22:16-18. The oppression of the Gentiles seems to be in the mind<br>
 of Zacharias. It is not certain how clearly he grasped the idea<br>
 of the spiritual Israel as Paul saw it in Galatians and Romans.<br>
 <br>
 1:74 <B>{Delivered}</B> <b><i>(\rhusthentas\)</i></b>. First aorist passive participle<br>
 of an old verb, \rhuomai\. The accusative case appears, where the<br>
 dative could have been used to agree with \h&#275;min\, because of the<br>
 infinitive \latreuein\ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->74)</i></b> <B>{to serve}</B> <b><i>(from <B>{latros}</B>,<br>
 for hire)</i></b>. But Plato uses the word of service for God so that the<br>
 bad sense does not always exist.<br>
 <br>
 1:75 <B>{In holiness and righteousness}</B> <b><i>(\en hosiot&#275;ti kai<br>
 dikaiosun&#275;i\)</i></b>. Not a usual combination <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph 4:24; Tit 1:8; 1Th<br>
 2:10)</i></b>. The Godward and the manward aspects of conduct <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 \Hosios\, the eternal principles of right, \dikaios\, the rule of<br>
 conduct before men.<br>
 <br>
 1:76 <B>{Yea and thou}</B> <b><i>(\kai su de\)</i></b>. Direct address to the child<br>
 with forecast of his life <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1:13-17)</i></b>. <B>{Prophet}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\proph&#275;t&#275;s\)</i></b>. The word here directly applied to the child. Jesus<br>
 will later call John a prophet and more than a prophet. <B>{The<br>
 Lord}</B> <b><i>(\Kuriou\)</i></b>. Jehovah as in <!-#-->1:16.<br>
 <br>
 1:77 <B>{Knowledge of salvation}</B> <b><i>(\gn&#333;sin s&#333;t&#275;rias\)</i></b>. "This is the<br>
 aim and end of the work of the Forerunner" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:78 <B>{Tender mercy}</B> <b><i>(\splagchna eleous\)</i></b>. Bowels of mercy<br>
 literally <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 3:8; Jas 3:11)</i></b>. Revised margin has it, hearts of<br>
 mercy. <B>{The dayspring from on high}</B> <b><i>(\anatol&#275; ex hupsous\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, rising from on high, like the rising sun or stars<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 60:19)</i></b>. The word is used also of a sprouting plant or<br>
 branch <b><i>(<!-#-->Jer 23:5; Zec 6:12)</i></b>, but that does not suit here.<br>
 <B>{Shall visit}</B> <b><i>(\epeskepsetai\)</i></b>, correct text, cf. <!-#-->1:68.<br>
 <br>
 1:79 <B>{To shine upon}</B> <b><i>(\epiph&#257;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 infinitive of \epiphain&#333;\ <b><i>(liquid verb)</i></b>. An old verb to give<br>
 light, to shine upon, like the sun or stars. See also <!-#-->Ac 27:20;<br>
 Tit 2:11; 3:4. <B>{The shadow of death}</B> <b><i>(\ski&#257;i thanatou\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ps<br>
 107:10, where darkness and shadow of death are combined as here.<br>
 Cf. also <!-#-->Isa 9:1. See on &#175;Mt 4:16. To guide <b><i>(\tou<br>
 kateuth&#8211;nai\)</i></b>. Genitive of the articular infinitive of purpose.<br>
 The light will enable them in the dark to see how to walk in a<br>
 straight path that leads to "the way of peace." We are still on<br>
 that road, but so many stumble for lack of light, men and<br>
 nations.<br>
 <br>
 1:80 <B>{Grew}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;uxane\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, was growing. <B>{Waxed<br>
 strong}</B> <b><i>(\ekrataiouto\)</i></b>. Imperfect again. The child kept growing<br>
 in strength of body and spirit. <B>{His shewing}</B> <b><i>(\anadeixe&#333;s<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. Here alone in the N.T. It occurs in Plutarch and<br>
 Polybius. The verb appears in a sacrificial sense. The boy, as he<br>
 grew, may have gone up to the passover and may have seen the boy<br>
 Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:42-52)</i></b>, but he would not know that he was to be the<br>
 Messiah. So these two boys of destiny grew on with the years, the<br>
 one in the desert hills near Hebron after Zacharias and Elisabeth<br>
 died, the other, the young Carpenter up in Nazareth, each waiting<br>
 for "his shewing unto Israel."<br>
