<p>4:1 <B>{Ministers of Christ}</B> <b><i>(\hup&#275;retas Christou\)</i></b>. Paul and all<br>
 ministers <b><i>(\diakonous\)</i></b> of the New Covenant <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 3:5)</i></b> are<br>
 under-rowers, subordinate rowers of Christ, only here in Paul's<br>
 Epistles, though in the Gospels <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 4:20 the attendant in the<br>
 synagogue)</i></b> and the Acts <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 13:5)</i></b> of John Mark. The <B>{so}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hout&#333;s\)</i></b> gathers up the preceding argument <b><i>(<!-#-->3:5-23)</i></b> and<br>
 applies it directly by the <B>{as}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s\)</i></b> that follows. <B>{Stewards<br>
 of the mysteries of God}</B> <b><i>(\oikonomous must&#275;ri&#333;n theou\)</i></b>. The<br>
 steward or house manager <b><i>(\oikos\, house, \nem&#333;\, to manage, old<br>
 word)</i></b> was a slave <b><i>(\doulos\)</i></b> under his lord <b><i>(\kurios\, <!-#-->Lu<br>
 12:42)</i></b>, but a master <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 16:1)</i></b> over the other slaves in the<br>
 house <b><i>(menservants \paidas\, maidservants \paidiskas\ <!-#-->Lu<br>
 12:45)</i></b>, an overseer <b><i>(\epitropos\)</i></b> over the rest <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 20:8)</i></b>.<br>
 Hence the under-rower <b><i>(\hup&#275;ret&#275;s\)</i></b> of Christ has a position of<br>
 great dignity as steward <b><i>(\oikonomos\)</i></b> of the mysteries of God.<br>
 Jesus had expressly explained that the mysteries of the kingdom<br>
 were open to the disciples <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 13:11)</i></b>. They were entrusted with<br>
 the knowledge of some of God's secrets though the disciples were<br>
 not such apt pupils as they claimed to be <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 13:51; 16:8-12)</i></b>.<br>
 As stewards Paul and other ministers are entrusted with the<br>
 mysteries <b><i>(see on &#175;1Co 2:7 for this word)</i></b> of God and are<br>
 expected to teach them. "The church is the \oikos\ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 3:15)</i></b>,<br>
 God the \oikodespot&#275;s\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 13:52)</i></b>, the members the \oikeioi\<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 6:10; Eph 2:19)</i></b>" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. Paul had a vivid sense of the<br>
 dignity of this stewardship <b><i>(\oikonomia\)</i></b> of God given to him<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 1:25; Eph 1:10)</i></b>. The ministry is more than a mere<br>
 profession or trade. It is a calling from God for stewardship.<br>
 <br>
 4:2 <B>{Here}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;de\)</i></b>. Either here on earth or in this matter. It<br>
 is always local. <B>{Moreover}</B> <b><i>(\loipon\)</i></b>. Like \loipon\ in <!-#-->1:16<br>
 which see, accusative of general reference, as for what is left,<br>
 besides. <B>{It is required}</B> <b><i>(\z&#275;teitai\)</i></b>. It is sought. Many MSS.<br>
 read \z&#275;teite\, ye seek, an easy change as \ai\ and \e\ came to<br>
 be pronounced alike <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 186)</i></b>. <B>{That a man<br>
 be found faithful}</B> <b><i>(\hina pistos tis heureth&#275;i\)</i></b>. Non-final use<br>
 of \hina\ with first aorist passive subjunctive of \heurisk&#333;\,<br>
 the result of the seeking <b><i>(\z&#275;te&#333;\)</i></b>. Fidelity is the essential<br>
 requirement in all such human relationships, in other words,<br>
 plain honesty in handling money like bank-clerks or in other<br>
 positions of trust like public office.<br>
 <br>
 4:3 <B>{But with me}</B> <b><i>(\emoi de\)</i></b>. The ethical dative of personal<br>
 relation and interest, "as I look at my own case." Cf. <!-#-->Php<br>
 1:21. <B>{It is a very small thing}</B> <b><i>(\eis elachiston estin\)</i></b>. This<br>
 predicate use of \eis\ is like the Hebrew, but it occurs also in<br>
 the papyri. The superlative \elachiston\ is elative, very little,<br>
 not the true superlative, least. "It counts for very little with<br>
 me." <B>{That I should be judged of you}</B> <b><i>(\hina huph' hum&#333;n<br>
 anakrith&#333;\)</i></b>. Same use of \hina\ as in verse <!-#-->2. For the verb<br>
 <b><i>(first aorist passive subjunctive of \anakrin&#333;\)</i></b> see on &#175;1Co<br>
 2:14f. Paul does not despise public opinion, but he denies "the<br>
 competency of the tribunal" in Corinth <b><i>(Robertson and Plummer)</i></b> to<br>
 pass on his credentials with Christ as his Lord. <B>{Or of man's<br>
 judgement}</B> <b><i>(\&#275; hupo anthr&#333;pin&#275;s h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. Or "by human day," in<br>
 contrast to the Lord's Day <b><i>(_der Tag_)</i></b> in <!-#-->3:13. "_That_ is the<br>
 tribunal which the Apostle recognizes; a _human_ tribunal he does<br>
 not care to satisfy" <b><i>(Robertson and Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{Yea, I judge not<br>
 mine own self}</B> <b><i>(\all' oude emauton anakrin&#333;\)</i></b>. \Alla\ here is<br>
 confirmatory, not adversative. "I have often wondered how it is<br>
 that every man sets less value on his own opinion of himself than<br>
 on the opinion of others" <b><i>(M. Aurelius, xii. 4. Translated by<br>
 Robertson and Plummer)</i></b>. Paul does not even set himself up as<br>
 judge of himself.<br>
 <br>
 4:4 <B>{For I know nothing against myself}</B> <b><i>(\ouden gar emaut&#333;i<br>
 sunoida\)</i></b>. Not a statement of fact, but an hypothesis to show the<br>
 unreliability of mere complacent self-satisfaction. Note the use<br>
 of \sunoida\ <b><i>(second perfect active indicative with dative<br>
 <b><i>(disadvantage)</i></b> of the reflexive pronoun)</i></b> for guilty knowledge<br>
 against oneself <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ac 5:2; 12:12; 14:6)</i></b>. <B>{Yet}</B> <b><i>(\all'\)</i></b>.<br>
 Adversative use of \alla\. <B>{Am I not hereby justified}</B> <b><i>(\ouk en<br>
 tout&#333;i dedikai&#333;mai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative of state of<br>
 completion. Failure to be conscious of one's own sins does not<br>
 mean that one is innocent. Most prisoners plead "not guilty." Who<br>
 is the judge of the steward of the mysteries of God? It is the<br>
 Lord "that judgeth me" <b><i>(\ho anakrin&#333;n me\)</i></b>. Probably, who<br>
 examines me and then passes on my fidelity <b><i>(\pistos\ in verse<br>
 <!-#-->2)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:5 <B>{Wherefore}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->3:21 which see. <B>{Judge<br>
 nothing}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; ti krinete\)</i></b>. Stop passing judgment, stop<br>
 criticizing as they were doing. See the words of Jesus in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 7:1. The censorious habit was ruining the Corinthian Church.<br>
 <B>{Before the time}</B> <b><i>(\pro kairou\)</i></b>. The day of the Lord in <!-#-->3:13.<br>
 "Do not therefore anticipate the great judgment <b><i>(\krisis\)</i></b> by any<br>
 preliminary investigation <b><i>(\anakrisis\)</i></b> which must be futile and<br>
 incomplete" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. <B>{Until the Lord come}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s an elth&#275;i<br>
 ho kurios\)</i></b>. Common idiom of \he&#333;s\ and the aorist subjunctive<br>
 with or without \an\ for a future event. Simple futurity, but<br>
 held forth as a glorious hope, the Second Coming of the Lord<br>
 Jesus as Judge. <B>{Who will both bring to light}</B> <b><i>(\hos kai<br>
 ph&#333;tisei\)</i></b>. Future indicative of this late verb <b><i>(in papyri also)</i></b><br>
 from \ph&#333;s\ <b><i>(light)</i></b>, to turn the light on the hidden things of<br>
 darkness. <B>{And make manifest}</B> <b><i>(\kai phaner&#333;sei\)</i></b>. <b><i>(Ionic and<br>
 late)</i></b> causative verb \phanero&#333;\ from \phaneros\. By turning on<br>
 the light the counsels of all hearts stand revealed. <B>{His praise}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ho epainos\)</i></b>. The praise <b><i>(note article)</i></b> due him from God <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro<br>
 2:29)</i></b> will come to each then <b><i>(\tote\)</i></b> and not till then.<br>
 Meanwhile Paul will carry on and wait for the praise from God.<br>
 <br>
 4:6 <B>{I have in a figure transferred}</B> <b><i>(\metesch&#275;matisa\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active <b><i>(not perfect)</i></b> indicative of \meta-sch&#275;matiz&#333;\, used<br>
 by Plato and Aristotle for changing the form of a thing <b><i>(from<br>
 \meta\, after, and \sch&#275;ma\, form or habit, like Latin _habitus_<br>
 from \ech&#333;\ and so different from \morph&#275;\ as in <!-#-->Php 2:7; Ro<br>
 12:2)</i></b>. For the idea of refashioning see Field, _Notes_, p. 169f.<br>
 and Preisigke, _Fachworter_)</i></b>. Both Greek and Latin writers<br>
 <b><i>(Quintilian, Martial)</i></b> used \sch&#275;ma\ for a rhetorical artifice.<br>
 Paul's use of the word <b><i>(in Paul only in N.T.)</i></b> appears also<br>
 further in <!-#-->2Co 11:13-15 where the word occurs three times,<br>
 twice of the false apostles posing and passing as apostles of<br>
 Christ and ministers of righteousness, and once of Satan as an<br>
 angel of light, twice with \eis\ and once with \h&#333;s\. In <!-#-->Php<br>
 3:21 the word is used for the change in the body of our<br>
 humiliation to the body of glory. But here it is clearly the<br>
 rhetorical figure for a veiled allusion to Paul and Apollos "for<br>
 your sakes" <b><i>(\dia humas\)</i></b>. <B>{That in us ye may learn}</B> <b><i>(\hina en<br>
 h&#275;min math&#275;te\)</i></b>. Final clause with \hina\ and the second aorist<br>
 active subjunctive of \manthan&#333;\, to learn. As an object lesson<br>
 in our cases <b><i>(\en h&#275;min\)</i></b>. It is no more true of Paul and Apollos<br>
 than of other ministers, but the wrangles in Corinth started<br>
 about them. So Paul boldly puts himself and Apollos to the fore<br>
 in the discussion of the principles involved. <B>{Not to go beyond<br>
 the things which are written}</B> <b><i>(\to M&#275; huper ha gegraptai\)</i></b>. It is<br>
 difficult to reproduce the Greek idiom in English. The article<br>
 \to\ is in the accusative case as the object of the verb<br>
 \math&#275;te\ <b><i>(learn)</i></b> and points at the words "\M&#275; huper ha<br>
 gegraptai\," apparently a proverb or rule, and elliptical in form<br>
 with no principal verb expressed with \m&#275;\, whether "think"<br>
 <b><i>(Auth.)</i></b> or "go" <b><i>(Revised)</i></b>. There was a constant tendency to<br>
 smooth out Paul's ellipses as in <!-#-->2Th 2:3; 1Co 1:26,31.<br>
 Lightfoot thinks that Paul may have in mind O.T. passages quoted<br>
 in <!-#-->1Co 1:19,31; 3:19,20. <B>{That ye be not puffed up}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275;<br>
 phusiousthe\)</i></b>. Sub-final use of \hina\ <b><i>(second use in this<br>
 sentence)</i></b> with notion of result. It is not certain whether<br>
 \phusiousthe\ <b><i>(late verb form like \phusia&#333;, phusa&#333;\, to blow up,<br>
 to inflate, to puff up)</i></b>, used only by Paul in the N.T., is<br>
 present indicative with \hina\ like \z&#275;loute\ in <!-#-->Ga 4:17 <b><i>(cf.<br>
 \hina gin&#333;skomen\ in <!-#-->1Jo 5:20)</i></b> or the present subjunctive by<br>
 irregular contraction <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 203, 342f.)</i></b>,<br>
 probably the present indicative. \Phusio&#333;\ is from \phusis\<br>
 <b><i>(nature)</i></b> and so meant to make natural, but it is used by Paul<br>
 just like \phusa&#333;\ or \phusia&#333;\ <b><i>(from \phusa\, a pair of<br>
 bellows)</i></b>, a vivid picture of self-conceit. <B>{One for the one<br>
 against the other}</B> <b><i>(\heis huper tou henos kata tou heterou\)</i></b>.<br>
 This is the precise idea of this idiom of partitive apposition.<br>
 This is the rule with partisans. They are "for" <b><i>(\huper\)</i></b> the one<br>
 and "against" <b><i>(\kata\, down on, the genitive case)</i></b> the other<br>
 <b><i>(\tou heterou\, not merely another or a second, but the different<br>
 sort, \heterodox\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:7 <B>{Maketh thee to differ}</B> <b><i>(\se diakrinei\)</i></b>. Distinguishes thee,<br>
 separates thee. \Diakrin&#333;\ means to sift or separate between<br>
 <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Ac 15:9 <b><i>(which see)</i></b> where \metaxu\ is added to<br>
 make it plainer. All self-conceit rests on the notion of<br>
 superiority of gifts and graces as if they were self-bestowed or<br>
 self-acquired. <B>{Which thou didst not receive}</B> <b><i>(\ho ouk elabes\)</i></b>.<br>
 "Another home-thrust" <b><i>(Robertson and Plummer)</i></b>. Pride of<br>
 intellect, of blood, of race, of country, of religion, is thus<br>
 shut out. <B>{Dost thou glory}</B> <b><i>(\kauchasai\)</i></b>. The original second<br>
 person singular middle ending \-sai\ is here preserved with<br>
 variable vowel contraction, \kauchaesai=kauchasai\ <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 341)</i></b>. Paul is fond of this old and bold verb for<br>
 boasting. <B>{As if thou hadst not received it}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s m&#275; lab&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 This neat participial clause <b><i>(second aorist active of \lamban&#333;\)</i></b><br>
 with \h&#333;s\ <b><i>(assumption)</i></b> and negative \m&#275;\ punctures effectually<br>
 the inflated bag of false pride. What pungent questions Paul has<br>
 asked. Robertson and Plummer say of Augustine, "Ten years before<br>
 the challenge of Pelagius, the study of St. Paul's writings, and<br>
 especially of this verse and of <!-#-->Ro 9:16, had crystallized in<br>
 his mind the distinctively Augustinian doctrines of man's total<br>
 depravity, of irresistible grace, and of absolute<br>
 predestination." Human responsibility does exist beyond a doubt,<br>
 but there is no foundation for pride and conceit.<br>
 <br>
 4:8 <B>{Already are ye filled?}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;d&#275; kekoresmenoi este?\)</i></b>. Perfect<br>
 passive indicative, state of completion, of \korennumi\, old<br>
 Greek verb to satiate, to satisfy. The only other example in N.T.<br>
 is <!-#-->Ac 27:38 which see. Paul may refer to <!-#-->De 31:20; 32:15. But<br>
 it is keen irony, even sarcasm. Westcott and Hort make it a<br>
 question and the rest of the sentence also. <B>{Already ye are<br>
 become rich}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;d&#275; eplout&#275;sate\)</i></b>. Note change to ingressive<br>
 aorist indicative of \ploute&#333;\, old verb to be rich <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->2Co<br>
 8:9)</i></b>. "The aorists, used instead of perfects, imply indecent<br>
 haste" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. "They have got a private millennium of their<br>
 own" <b><i>(Robertson & Plummer)</i></b> with all the blessings of the<br>
 Messianic Kingdom <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:29f.; 1Th 2:12; 2Ti 2:12)</i></b>. <B>{Ye have<br>
 reigned without us}</B> <b><i>(\ch&#333;ris h&#275;m&#333;n ebasileusate\)</i></b>. Withering<br>
 sarcasm. Ye became kings without our company. Some think that<br>
 Paul as in <!-#-->3:21 is purposely employing Stoic phraseology though<br>
 with his own meanings. If so, it is hardly consciously done. Paul<br>
 was certainly familiar with much of the literature of his time,<br>
 but it did not shape his ideas. <B>{I would that ye did reign}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 ophelon ge ebasileusate\)</i></b>. More exactly, "And would at least that<br>
 ye had come to reign <b><i>(or become kings)</i></b>." It is an unfulfilled<br>
 wish about the past expressed by \ophelon\ and the aorist<br>
 indicative instead of \ei gar\ and the aorist indicative <b><i>(the<br>
 ancient idiom)</i></b>. See Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1003, for the<br>
 construction with particle \ophelon\ <b><i>(an unaugmented second<br>
 aorist form)</i></b>. <B>{That we also might reign with you}</B> <b><i>(\hina kai<br>
 h&#275;meis humin sunbasileus&#333;men\)</i></b>. Ironical contrast to \ch&#333;ris<br>
 h&#275;m&#333;n ebasileusate\, just before. Associative instrumental case<br>
 of \humin\ after \sun-\.<br>
 <br>
 4:9 <B>{Hath set forth us the apostles last}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;mas tous apostolous<br>
 eschatous apedeixen\)</i></b>. The first aorist active indicative of<br>
 \apodeiknumi\, old verb to show, to expose to view or exhibit<br>
 <b><i>(Herodotus)</i></b>, in technical sense <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->2Th 2:4)</i></b> for gladiatorial<br>
 show as in \eth&#275;riomach&#275;sa\ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:32)</i></b>. In this grand pageant<br>
 Paul and other apostles come last <b><i>(\eschatous\, predicate<br>
 accusative after \apedeixen\)</i></b> as a grand finale. <B>{As men doomed<br>
 to die}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s epithanatious\)</i></b>. Late word, here alone in N.T. The<br>
 LXX <b><i>(Bel and the Dragon 31)</i></b> has it for those thrown daily to the<br>
 lions. Dionysius of Halicarnassus <b><i>(_A.R_. vii. 35)</i></b> uses it of<br>
 those thrown from the Tarpeian Rock. The gladiators would say<br>
 _morituri salutamus_. All this in violent contrast to the kingly<br>
 Messianic pretensions of the Corinthians. <B>{A spectacle}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\theatron\)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Heb 11:33-40. The word, like our theatre,<br>
 means the place of the show <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 19:29,31)</i></b>. Then, it means the<br>
 spectacle shown there <b><i>(\theama\ or \thea\)</i></b>, and, as here, the man<br>
 exhibited as the show like the verb \theatrizomenoi\, made a<br>
 spectacle <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 10:33)</i></b>. Sometimes it refers to the spectators<br>
 <b><i>(\theatai\)</i></b> like our "house" for the audience. Here the<br>
 spectators include "the world, both to angels and men" <b><i>(\t&#333;i<br>
 kosm&#333;i kai aggelois kai anthr&#333;pois\)</i></b>, dative case of personal<br>
 interest.<br>
 <br>
 4:10 <B>{We--you}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meis--humeis\)</i></b>. Triple contrast in keenest<br>
 ironical emphasis. "The three antitheses refer respectively to<br>
 teaching, demeanour, and worldly position" <b><i>(Robertson and<br>
 Plummer)</i></b>. The apostles were fools for Christ's sake <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 4:11;<br>
 Php 3:7)</i></b>. They made "union with Christ the basis of worldly<br>
 wisdom" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. There is change of order <b><i>(chiasm)</i></b> in the third<br>
 ironical contrast. They are over strong in pretension. \Endoxos\,<br>
 illustrious, is one of the 103 words found only in Luke and Paul<br>
 in the N.T. Notion of display and splendour.<br>
 <br>
 4:11 <B>{Even unto this present hour}</B> <b><i>(\achri t&#275;s arti h&#333;ras\)</i></b>.<br>
 \Arti\ <b><i>(just now, this very minute)</i></b> accents the continuity of the<br>
 contrast as applied to Paul. Ten verbs and four participles from<br>
 <!-#-->11-13 give a graphic picture of Paul's condition in Ephesus<br>
 when he is writing this epistle. <B>{We hunger}</B> <b><i>(\pein&#333;men\)</i></b>, <B>{we<br>
 thirst}</B> <b><i>(\dips&#333;men\)</i></b>, <B>{are naked}</B> <b><i>(\gumniteuomen\)</i></b>, late verb for<br>
 scant clothing from \gumn&#275;t&#275;s\, <B>{are buffeted}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kolaphizometha\)</i></b>, to strike a blow with the fist from<br>
 \kolaphos\ and one of the few N.T. and ecclesiastical words and<br>
 see on &#175;Mt 26:67, <B>{have no certain dwelling place}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\astatoumen\)</i></b> from \astatos\, strolling about and only here save<br>
 Anthol. Pal. and Aquila in <!-#-->Isa 58:7. Field in _Notes_, p. 170<br>
 renders <!-#-->1Co 4:11 "and are vagabonds" or spiritual hobos.<br>
 <br>
 4:12 <B>{We toil}</B> <b><i>(\kopi&#333;men\)</i></b>. Common late verb for weariness in<br>
 toil <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 5:5)</i></b>, <B>{working with our own hands}</B> <b><i>(\ergazomenoi tais<br>
 idiais chersin\)</i></b> instrumental case \chersin\ and not simply for<br>
 himself but also for Aquila and Priscilla as he explains in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 20:34. This personal touch gives colour to the outline. Paul<br>
 alludes to this fact often <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 2:9; 2Th 3:8; 1Co 9:6; 2Co<br>
 11:7)</i></b>. "Greeks despised manual labour; St. Paul glories in it"<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson and Plummer)</i></b>. Cf. Deissmann, _Light, etc._, p. 317.<br>
 <B>{Being reviled we bless}</B> <b><i>(\loidoroumenoi eulogoumen\)</i></b>. Almost the<br>
 language of Peter about Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 2:23)</i></b> in harmony with the<br>
 words of Jesus in <!-#-->Mt 5:44; Lu 6:27. <B>{Being persecuted we<br>
 endure}</B> <b><i>(\di&#333;komenoi anechometha\)</i></b>. We hold back and do not<br>
 retaliate. Turn to Paul's other picture of his experiences in the<br>
 vivid contrasts in <!-#-->2Co 4:7-10; 6:3-10 for an interpretation of<br>
 his language here.<br>
 <br>
 4:13 <B>{Being defamed we intreat}</B> <b><i>(\dusph&#275;moumenoi parakaloumen\)</i></b>.<br>
 The participle \dusph&#275;moumenoi\ is an old verb <b><i>(in I Macc. 7:41)</i></b><br>
 to use ill, from \dusph&#275;mos\, but occurs here only in the N.T.<br>
 Paul is opening his very heart now after the keen irony above.<br>
 <B>{As the filth of the world}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s perikatharmata tou kosmou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, sweepings, rinsings, cleansings around, dust from the<br>
 floor, from \perikathair&#333;\, to cleanse all around <b><i>(Plato and<br>
 Aristotle)</i></b> and so the refuse thrown off in cleansing. Here only<br>
 in the N.T. and only twice elsewhere. \Katharma\ was the refuse<br>
 of a sacrifice. In <!-#-->Pr 21:18 \perikatharma\ occurs for the<br>
 scapegoat. The other example is Epictetus iii. 22,78, in the same<br>
 sense of an expiatory offering of a worthless fellow. It was the<br>
 custom in Athens during a plague to throw to the sea some wretch<br>
 in the hope of appeasing the gods. One hesitates to take it so<br>
 here in Paul, though Findlay thinks that possibly in Ephesus Paul<br>
 may have heard some such cry like that in the later martyrdoms<br>
 _Christiani ad leones_. At any rate in <!-#-->1Co 15:32 Paul says "I<br>
 fought with wild beasts" and in <!-#-->2Co 1:9 "I had the answer of<br>
 death." Some terrible experience may be alluded to here. The word<br>
 shows the contempt of the Ephesian populace for Paul as is shown<br>
 in <!-#-->Ac 19:23-41 under the influence of Demetrius and the<br>
 craftsmen. <B>{The offscouring of all things}</B> <b><i>(\pant&#333;n perips&#275;ma\)</i></b>.<br>
 Late word, here only in N.T., though in Tob. 5:18. The word was<br>
 used in a formula at Athens when victims were flung into the sea,<br>
 \perips&#275;ma h&#275;m&#333;n genou\ <b><i>(Became a \perips&#275;ma\ for us)</i></b>, in the<br>
 sense of expiation. The word merely means scraping around from<br>
 \peripsa&#333;\, offscrapings or refuse. That is probably the idea<br>
 here as in Tob. 5:18. It came to have a complimentary sense for<br>
 the Christians who in a plague gave their lives for the sick. But<br>
 it is a bold figure here with Paul of a piece with<br>
 \perikatharmata\.<br>
 <br>
 4:14 <B>{To shame you}</B> <b><i>(\entrep&#333;n\)</i></b>. Literally, shaming you <b><i>(present<br>
 active participle of \entrep&#333;\)</i></b>, old verb to turn one on himself<br>
 either middle or with reflexive pronoun and active, but the<br>
 reflexive \heautois\ is not expressed here. See on &#175;2Th 3:14.<br>
 The harsh tone has suddenly changed.<br>
 <br>
 4:15 <B>{To admonish}</B> <b><i>(\nouthet&#333;n\)</i></b>. Literally, admonishing <b><i>(present<br>
 active participle of \nouthete&#333;\)</i></b>. See on &#175;1Th 5:12,14. <B>{For<br>
 though ye should have}</B> <b><i>(\ean gar ech&#275;te\)</i></b>. Third-class condition<br>
 undetermined, but with prospect of being determined <b><i>(\ean\ and<br>
 present subjunctive)</i></b>, "for if ye have." <B>{Tutors}</B> <b><i>(\paidag&#333;gous\)</i></b>.<br>
 This old word <b><i>(\pais\, boy, \ag&#333;gos\, leader)</i></b> was used for the<br>
 guide or attendant of the child who took him to school as in <!-#-->Ga<br>
 3:24 <b><i>(Christ being the schoolmaster)</i></b> and also as a sort of tutor<br>
 who had a care for the child when not in school. The papyri<br>
 examples <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan, _Vocabulary_)</i></b> illustrate both<br>
 aspects of the paedagogue. Here it is the "tutor in Christ" who<br>
 is the Teacher. These are the only two N.T. examples of the<br>
 common word. <B>{I begot you}</B> <b><i>(\humas egenn&#275;sa\)</i></b>. Paul is their<br>
 <B>{spiritual father}</B> in Christ, while Apollos and the rest are<br>
 their <B>{tutors}</B> in Christ.<br>
 <br>
 4:16 <B>{Be ye imitators of me}</B> <b><i>(\mim&#275;tai mou ginesthe\)</i></b>. "Keep on<br>
 becoming <b><i>(present middle imperative)</i></b> imitators of me <b><i>(objective<br>
 genitive)</i></b>." \Mim&#275;t&#275;s\ is an old word from \mimeomai\, to copy, to<br>
 mimic <b><i>(\mimos\)</i></b>. Paul stands for his rights as their spiritual<br>
 father against the pretensions of the Judaizers who have turned<br>
 them against him by the use of the names of Apollos and Cephas.<br>
 <br>
 4:17 <B>{Have I sent}</B> <b><i>(\epempsa\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative.<br>
 Probably Timothy had already gone as seems clear from <!-#-->16:10f.<br>
 Apparently Timothy came back to Ephesus and was sent on to<br>
 Macedonia before the uproar in Ephesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 19:22)</i></b>. Probably<br>
 also Titus was then despatched to Corinth, also before the<br>
 uproar. <B>{In every church}</B> <b><i>(\en pas&#275;i ekkl&#275;si&#257;i\)</i></b>. Paul expects<br>
 his teachings and practices to be followed in every church <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 14:33)</i></b>. Note his language here "my ways those in Christ Jesus."<br>
 Timothy as Paul's spokesman <B>{will remind}</B> <b><i>(\anamn&#275;sei\)</i></b> the<br>
 Corinthians of Paul's teachings.<br>
 <br>
 4:18 <B>{Some are puffed up}</B> <b><i>(\ephusi&#333;th&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 <b><i>(effective)</i></b> passive indicative of \phusio&#333;\ which see on verse<br>
 &#175;6. <B>{As though I were not coming to you}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s m&#275; erchomenou mou<br>
 pros humas\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute with particle <b><i>(assuming it as so)</i></b><br>
 with \m&#275;\ as negative.<br>
 <br>
 4:19 <B>{If the Lord will}</B> <b><i>(\ean ho kurios thel&#275;s&#275;i\)</i></b>. Third-class<br>
 condition. See James <!-#-->4:15; Ac 18:21; 1Co 16:7 for the use of<br>
 this phrase. It should represent one's constant attitude, though<br>
 not always to be spoken aloud. <B>{But the power}</B> <b><i>(\alla t&#275;n<br>
 dunamin\)</i></b>. The puffed up Judaizers did a deal of talking in<br>
 Paul's absence. He will come and will know their real strength.<br>
 II Corinthians gives many evidences of Paul's sensitiveness to<br>
 their talk about his inconsistencies and cowardice <b><i>(in particular<br>
 chs. <!-#-->2 Co 1; 2; 10; 11; 12; 13)</i></b>. He changed his plans to spare<br>
 them, not from timidity. It will become plain later that Timothy<br>
 failed on this mission and that Titus succeeded.<br>
 <br>
 4:21 <B>{With a rod}</B> <b><i>(\en rabd&#333;i\)</i></b>. The so-called instrumental use<br>
 of \en\ like the Hebrew <b><i>(<!-#-->1Sa 17:43)</i></b>. The shepherd leaned on his<br>
 rod, staff, walking stick. The paedagogue had his rod also.<br>
 <B>{Shall I come?}</B> <b><i>(\elth&#333;;\)</i></b>. Deliberative subjunctive. Paul gives<br>
 them the choice. They can have him as their spiritual father or<br>
 as their paedagogue with a rod.<br>
