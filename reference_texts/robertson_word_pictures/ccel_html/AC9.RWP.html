<p>9:1 <B>{Yet}</B> <b><i>(\eti\)</i></b>. As if some time elapsed between the death of<br>
 Stephen as is naturally implied by the progressive persecution<br>
 described in <!-#-->8:3. The zeal of Saul the persecutor increased<br>
 with success. <B>{Breathing threatening and slaughter}</B> <b><i>(\enpne&#333;n<br>
 apeil&#275;s kai phonou\)</i></b>. Present active participle of old and common<br>
 verb. Not "breathing out," but "breathing in" <b><i>(inhaling)</i></b> as in<br>
 Aeschylus and Plato or "breathing on" <b><i>(from Homer on)</i></b>. The<br>
 partitive genitive of \apeil&#275;s\ and \phonou\ means that<br>
 threatening and slaughter had come to be the very breath that<br>
 Saul breathed, like a warhorse who sniffed the smell of battle.<br>
 He breathed on the remaining disciples the murder that he had<br>
 already breathed in from the death of the others. He exhaled what<br>
 he inhaled. Jacob had said that "Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf"<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 49:27)</i></b>. This greatest son of Benjamin was fulfilling this<br>
 prophecy <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. The taste of blood in the death of Stephen<br>
 was pleasing to young Saul <b><i>(<!-#-->8:1)</i></b> and now he revelled in the<br>
 slaughter of the saints both men and women. In <!-#-->26:11 Luke<br>
 quotes Paul as saying that he was "exceedingly mad against them."<br>
 <br>
 9:2 <B>{Asked}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;it&#275;sato\)</i></b>. First aorist middle indicative, the<br>
 indirect middle, asked for himself <b><i>(as a favour to himself)</i></b>.<br>
 Felten notes that "Saul as a Pharisee makes request of a<br>
 Sadducee" <b><i>(the high priest)</i></b> either Caiaphas if before A.D. 35,<br>
 but if in 36 Jonathan, son of Caiaphas or if in 37 Theophilus,<br>
 another son of Caiaphas. <B>{Letters}</B> <b><i>(\epistolas\)</i></b>. Julius Ceasar<br>
 and Augustus had granted the high priest and Sanhedrin<br>
 jurisdiction over Jews in foreign cities, but this central<br>
 ecclesiastical authority was not always recognized in every local<br>
 community outside of Judea. Paul says that he received his<br>
 authority to go to Damascus from the priests <b><i>(<!-#-->Acts 26:10)</i></b> and<br>
 "the estate of the elders" <b><i>(<!-#-->22:5)</i></b>, that is the Sanhedrin. <B>{To<br>
 Damascus}</B> <b><i>(\eis Damaskon\)</i></b>. As if no disciples of importance<br>
 <b><i>(outside the apostles in Jerusalem)</i></b> were left in Judea. Damascus<br>
 at this time may have been under the rule of Aretas of Arabia<br>
 <b><i>(tributary to Rome)</i></b> as it certainly was a couple of years later<br>
 when Saul escaped in a basket <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:32)</i></b>. This old city is the<br>
 most enduring in the history of the world <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. It is some<br>
 150 miles Northeast from Jerusalem and watered by the river Abana<br>
 from Anti-Lebanon. Here the Jews were strong in numbers <b><i>(10,000<br>
 butchered by Nero later)</i></b> and here some disciples had found refuge<br>
 from Saul's persecution in Judea and still worshipped in the<br>
 synagogues. Paul's language in <!-#-->Ac 26:11 seems to mean that<br>
 Damascus is merely one of other "foreign cities" to which he<br>
 carried the persecution. <B>{If he found}</B> <b><i>(\ean heur&#275;i\)</i></b>. Third<br>
 class condition with aorist subjunctive retained after secondary<br>
 tense <b><i>(asked)</i></b>. <B>{The Way}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;s hodou\)</i></b>. A common method in the<br>
 Acts for describing Christianity as the Way of life, absolutely<br>
 as also in <!-#-->19:9,23; 22:4; 24:14,22 or the way of salvation<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->16:17)</i></b> or the way of the Lord <b><i>(<!-#-->18:25)</i></b>. It is a Jewish<br>
 definition of life as in <!-#-->Isa 40:3 "the way of the Lord," <!-#-->Ps<br>
 1:6 "the way of the righteous," "the way of the wicked." Jesus<br>
 called himself "the way" <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 14:6)</i></b>, the only way to the<br>
 Father. The so-called Epistle of Barnabas presents the Two Ways.<br>
 The North American Indians call Christianity the Jesus Road.<br>
 <B>{That he might bring them bound}</B> <b><i>(\hop&#333;s dedemenous agag&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Final clause with \hop&#333;s\ <b><i>(less common than \hina\)</i></b> and aorist<br>
 <b><i>(effective)</i></b> subjunctive <b><i>(\agag&#275;i\, reduplicated aorist of \ag&#333;\,<br>
 common verb)</i></b> and perfect passive participle <b><i>(\dedemenous\)</i></b> of<br>
 \de&#333;\, in a state of sheer helplessness like his other victims<br>
 both men and women. Three times <b><i>(<!-#-->8:3; 9:2; 22:4)</i></b> this fact of<br>
 persecuting women is mentioned as a special blot in Paul's<br>
 cruelty <b><i>(the third time by Paul himself)</i></b> and one of the items in<br>
 his being chief of sinners <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 1:15)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:3 <B>{As he journeyed}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i poreuesthai\)</i></b>. Luke's common idiom<br>
 for a temporal clause <b><i>(in the journeying)</i></b>, \en\ with the locative<br>
 articular middle infinitive. <B>{Drew nigh}</B> <b><i>(\eggizein\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 active infinitive, was drawing nigh. <B>{Shone round about him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\auton peri&#275;strapsen\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active<br>
 indicative of \periastrapt&#333;\, late compound verb common in LXX<br>
 and Byzantine writers, here and <!-#-->22:6 alone in the N.T. "A light<br>
 from heaven suddenly flashed around him." It was like a flash of<br>
 lightning. Paul uses the same verb in <!-#-->22:5, but in <!-#-->26:13 he<br>
 employs \perilampsan\ <b><i>(shining around)</i></b>. There are numerous<br>
 variations in the historical narrative of Saul's conversion in<br>
 <!-#-->9:3-18 and Luke's report of Paul's two addresses, one on the<br>
 steps of the Tower of Antonia facing the murderous mob<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->22:6-16)</i></b>, the other before Festus and Agrippa <b><i>(<!-#-->26:12-20)</i></b>. A<br>
 great deal of capital has been made of these variations to the<br>
 discredit of Luke as a writer as if he should have made Paul's<br>
 two speeches conform at every point with his own narrative. This<br>
 objection has no weight except for those who hold that Luke<br>
 composed Paul's speeches freely as some Greek writers used to do.<br>
 But, if Luke had notes of Paul's speeches or help from Paul<br>
 himself, he naturally preserved the form of the two addresses<br>
 without trying to make them agree with each other in all details<br>
 or with his own narrative in chapter 9. Luke evidently attached<br>
 great importance to the story of Saul's conversion as the turning<br>
 point not simply in the career of the man, but an epoch in the<br>
 history of apostolic Christianity. In broad outline and in all<br>
 essentials the three accounts agree and testify to the<br>
 truthfulness of the account of the conversion of Saul. It is<br>
 impossible to overestimate the worth to the student of<br>
 Christianity of this event from every angle because we have in<br>
 Paul's Epistles his own emphasis on the actual appearance of<br>
 Jesus to him as the fact that changed his whole life <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:8;<br>
 Ga 1:16f.)</i></b>. The variations that appear in the three accounts do<br>
 not mar the story, when rightly understood, as we shall see.<br>
 Here, for instance, Luke simply mentions "a light from heaven,"<br>
 while in <!-#-->22:6 Paul calls it "a great <b><i>(\hikanon\)</i></b> light" "about<br>
 noon" and in <!-#-->26:13 "above the brightness of the sun," as it<br>
 would have to be "at midday" with the sun shining.<br>
 <br>
 9:4 <B>{He fell upon the earth}</B> <b><i>(\pes&#333;n epi t&#275;n g&#275;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active participle. So in <!-#-->22:7 Paul says: "I fell unto the<br>
 ground" <b><i>(\epesa eis to edaphos\)</i></b> using an old word rather than<br>
 the common \g&#275;n\. In <!-#-->26:14 Paul states that "we were all fallen<br>
 to the earth" <b><i>(\pant&#333;n katapesont&#333;n h&#275;m&#333;n eis t&#275;n g&#275;n\, genitive<br>
 absolute construction)</i></b>. But here in verse <!-#-->7 "the men that<br>
 journeyed with him stood speechless" <b><i>(\hist&#275;keisan eneoi\)</i></b>. But<br>
 surely the points of time are different. In <!-#-->26:14 Paul refers<br>
 to the first appearance of the vision when all fell to the earth.<br>
 Here in verse <!-#-->7 Luke refers to what occurred after the vision<br>
 when both Saul and the men had risen from the ground. <B>{Saul,<br>
 Saul}</B> <b><i>(\Saoul, Saoul\)</i></b>. The Hebrew form occurs also in <!-#-->22:7;<br>
 26:14 where it is expressly stated that the voice was in the<br>
 Hebrew <b><i>(Aramaic)</i></b> tongue as also in <!-#-->9:17 <b><i>(Ananias)</i></b>. Deissmann<br>
 <b><i>(_Bible Studies_, p. 316)</i></b> terms this use of \Saoul\ "the<br>
 historian's sense of liturgical rhythm." For the repetition of<br>
 names by Jesus note <!-#-->Lu 10:41 <b><i>(Martha, Martha)</i></b>, <!-#-->Lu 22:31<br>
 <b><i>(Simon, Simon)</i></b>. <B>{Me}</B> <b><i>(\me\)</i></b>. In persecuting the disciples, Saul<br>
 was persecuting Jesus, as the words of Jesus in verse <!-#-->5 made<br>
 plain. Christ had already spoken of the mystic union between<br>
 himself and his followers <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:40; 25:40,45; Joh 15:1-5)</i></b>. The<br>
 proverb <b><i>(Pindar)</i></b> that Jesus quotes to Saul about kicking against<br>
 the goad is genuine in <!-#-->26:14, but not here.<br>
 <br>
 9:5 <B>{Lord}</B> <b><i>(\kurie\)</i></b>. It is open to question if \kurie\ should<br>
 not here be translated "Sir" as in <!-#-->16:30 and in <!-#-->Mt 21:29,30;<br>
 Joh 5:7; 12:21; 20:15; and should be so in <!-#-->Joh 9:36. It is<br>
 hardly likely that at this stage Saul recognized Jesus as Lord,<br>
 though he does so greet him in <!-#-->22:10 "What shall I do, Lord?"<br>
 Saul may have recognized the vision as from God as Cornelius says<br>
 "Lord" in <!-#-->10:4. Saul surrendered instantly as Thomas did <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 20:28)</i></b> and as little Samuel <b><i>(<!-#-->1Sa 3:9)</i></b>. This surrender of the<br>
 will to Christ was the conversion of Saul. He saw a real Person,<br>
 the Risen Christ, to whom he surrendered his life. On this point<br>
 he never wavered for a moment to the end.<br>
 <br>
 9:6 The best MSS. do not have "trembling and astonished," and<br>
 "What wilt thou have me to do, Lord?" The Textus Receptus put<br>
 these words in here without the authority of a Greek codex. See<br>
 <!-#-->22:10 above for the genuine text. <B>{It shall be told thee}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\lal&#275;th&#275;setai\)</i></b>. Future passive indicative of \lale&#333;\. It is<br>
 hardly likely that Luke records all that Jesus said to Saul, but<br>
 more was to come on his arrival in Damascus. Saul had received<br>
 all that he could bear just now <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 16:12)</i></b>. <B>{What}</B> <b><i>(\hoti\)</i></b>.<br>
 Rare in _Koin&#275;_ use of this indefinite neuter relative in an<br>
 indirect question, the only example in the N.T. <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 731)</i></b>. Human agents like Ananias can finish what<br>
 Jesus by supernatural manifestation has here begun in Saul.<br>
 <br>
 9:7 <B>{That journeyed with him}</B> <b><i>(\hoi sunodeuontes aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Not in<br>
 the older Greek, but in the _Koin&#275;_, with the associative<br>
 instrumental. <B>{Speechless}</B> <b><i>(\eneoi\)</i></b>. Mute. Only here in N.T.,<br>
 though old word. <B>{Hearing the voice, but beholding no man}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\akouontes men t&#275;s ph&#333;n&#275;s, m&#275;dena de the&#333;rountes\)</i></b>. Two present<br>
 active participles in contrast <b><i>(\men, de\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->22:9 Paul says<br>
 that the men "beheld the light" <b><i>(\to men ph&#333;s etheasanto\)</i></b>, but<br>
 evidently did not discern the person. Paul also says there, "but<br>
 they heard not the voice of him that spake to me" <b><i>(\t&#275;n de ph&#333;n&#275;n<br>
 ouk &#275;kousan tou lalountos moi\)</i></b>. Instead of this being a flat<br>
 contradiction of what Luke says in <!-#-->9:7 it is natural to take it<br>
 as being likewise <b><i>(as with the "light" and "no one")</i></b> a<br>
 distinction between the "sound" <b><i>(original sense of \ph&#333;n&#275;\ as in<br>
 <!-#-->Joh 3:8)</i></b> and the separate words spoken. It so happens that<br>
 \akou&#333;\ is used either with the accusative <b><i>(the extent of the<br>
 hearing)</i></b> or the genitive <b><i>(the specifying)</i></b>. It is possible that<br>
 such a distinction here coincides with the two senses of \ph&#333;n&#275;\.<br>
 They heard the sound <b><i>(<!-#-->9:7)</i></b>, but did not understand the words<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->22:9)</i></b>. However, this distinction in case with \akou&#333;\, though<br>
 possible and even probable here, is by no means a necessary one<br>
 for in <!-#-->Joh 3:8 where \ph&#333;n&#275;n\ undoubtedly means "sound" the<br>
 accusative occurs as Luke uses \&#275;kousen ph&#333;n&#275;n\ about Saul in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 9:4. Besides in <!-#-->22:7 Paul uses \&#275;kousa ph&#333;n&#275;s\ about himself,<br>
 but \&#275;kousa ph&#333;n&#275;n\ about himself in <!-#-->76:14, interchangeably.<br>
 <br>
 9:8 <B>{He saw nothing}</B> <b><i>(\ouden eblepen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active<br>
 indicative, was seeing nothing. "The glory of that light"<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->22:11)</i></b> when he saw Jesus had blinded his eyes now wide open<br>
 <b><i>(\ane&#333;igmen&#333;n\, perfect passive participle of \anoig&#333;\ with<br>
 double reduplication)</i></b>. The blindness was proof that something had<br>
 happened to him and that it was no hallucination that he had seen<br>
 the Risen Christ. Saul arose after the others were on their feet.<br>
 <B>{They led him by the hand}</B> <b><i>(\cheirag&#333;gountes\)</i></b>. From<br>
 \cheirag&#333;gos\ <b><i>(\cheir\, hand and \ag&#333;\, to lead)</i></b>. Only here in<br>
 the N.T., but in LXX and late writers though not in the old<br>
 Greek. It was a pathetic picture to see the masterful Saul,<br>
 victorious persecutor and conqueror of the disciples, now<br>
 helpless as a child.<br>
 <br>
 9:9 <B>{Not seeing}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; blep&#333;n\)</i></b>. The usual negative \m&#275;\ of the<br>
 participle. It was a crisis for Saul, this sudden blindness for<br>
 three days <b><i>(\h&#275;meras treis\, accusative of extent of time)</i></b>. Later<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 4:15)</i></b> Paul has an affection of the eyes which may have been<br>
 caused by this experience on the road to Damascus or at least his<br>
 eyes may have been predisposed by it to weakness in the glare of<br>
 the Syrian sun in the land where today so much eye trouble<br>
 exists. He neither ate nor drank anything, for his appetite had<br>
 gone as often happens in a crisis of the soul. These must have<br>
 been days of terrible stress and strain.<br>
 <br>
 9:10 <B>{Ananias}</B> <b><i>(\Hananias\)</i></b>. Name common enough <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->5:1 for<br>
 another Ananias)</i></b> and means "Jehovah is gracious." _Nomen et omen_<br>
 <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. This Ananias had the respect of both Jews and<br>
 Christians in Damascus <b><i>(<!-#-->22:12)</i></b>. <B>{In a vision}</B> <b><i>(\en horamati\)</i></b>.<br>
 Zeller and others scout the idea of the historicity of this<br>
 vision as supernatural. Even Furneaux holds that "it is a<br>
 characteristic of the Jewish Christian sources to point out the<br>
 Providential ordering of events by the literary device of a<br>
 vision," as "in the early chapters of Matthew's and Luke's<br>
 Gospels." He is content with this "beautiful expression of the<br>
 belief" with no interest in the actual facts. But that is plain<br>
 illusion, not to say delusion, and makes both Paul and Luke<br>
 deceived by the story of Ananias <b><i>(<!-#-->9:10-18; 22:12-16,26)</i></b>. One<br>
 MS. of the old Latin Version does omit the vision to Ananias and<br>
 that is basis enough for those who deny the supernatural aspects<br>
 of Christianity.<br>
 <br>
 9:11 <B>{To the street}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;n rhum&#275;n\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Lu 14:21. A run<br>
 way <b><i>(from \rhe&#333;\, to run)</i></b> between the houses. So were the narrow<br>
 lanes or alleys called streets and finally in later Greek the<br>
 word is applied to streets even when broad. <B>{Straight}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eutheian\)</i></b>. Most of the city lanes were crooked like the<br>
 streets of Boston <b><i>(old cow-paths, people say)</i></b>, but this one still<br>
 runs "in a direct line from the eastern to the western gate of<br>
 the city" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. Since the ancients usually rebuilt on the<br>
 same sites, it is probable that the line of the street of that<br>
 name today is the same, though the actual level has been much<br>
 raised. Hence the identification of the house of Ananias and the<br>
 house of Judas are very precarious.<br>
 <br>
 9:12 <B>{Coming in and laying}</B> <b><i>(\eiselthonta kai epithenta\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active participles picturing the punctiliar<br>
 act as a sort of indirect discourse after verbs of sensation<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 1040-2)</i></b>. Some ancient documents do not<br>
 have "in a vision" here. <B>{Receive his sight}</B> <b><i>(\anablepsei\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active subjunctive with \hop&#333;s\ <b><i>(purpose)</i></b>. See again<br>
 as in <!-#-->9:17.<br>
 <br>
 9:13 <B>{How much evil}</B> <b><i>(\hosa kaka\)</i></b>. How many evil things. Saul's<br>
 reputation <b><i>(<!-#-->26:10)</i></b> as a persecutor had preceded him. <B>{To thy<br>
 saints}</B> <b><i>(\tois hagiois\)</i></b>. Dative of disadvantage. "Used here for<br>
 the first time as a name for the Christians" <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>, but it<br>
 came to be the common and normal <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b> term for followers of<br>
 Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->9:32,41; 26:10; 1Co 1:2, etc.)</i></b>. This common word is<br>
 from \to hagos\, religious awe or reverence and is applied to<br>
 God's name <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:49)</i></b>, God's temple <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 24:15)</i></b>, God's people<br>
 as set apart for God <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:70; 2:23; Ro 1:7, etc.)</i></b>. Ananias in<br>
 his ignorance saw in Saul only the man with an evil reputation<br>
 while Jesus saw in Saul the man transformed by grace to be a<br>
 messenger of mercy.<br>
 <br>
 9:14 <B>{Hath authority}</B> <b><i>(\echei exousian\)</i></b>. Probably Ananias had<br>
 received letters from the Christians left in Jerusalem warning<br>
 him of the coming of Saul. The protest of Ananias to Jesus<br>
 against any dealing with Saul is a fine illustration of our own<br>
 narrow ignorance in our rebellious moods against the will of God.<br>
 <br>
 9:15 <B>{A chosen vessel}</B> <b><i>(\skeuos eklog&#275;s\)</i></b>. A vessel of choice or<br>
 selection. The genitive of quality is common in the Hebrew, as in<br>
 the vernacular _Koin&#275;_. Jesus chose Saul before Saul chose Jesus.<br>
 He felt of himself that he was an earthen vessel <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 4:7)</i></b><br>
 unworthy of so great a treasure. It was a great message that<br>
 Ananias had to bear to Saul. He told it in his own way <b><i>(<!-#-->9:17;<br>
 22:14f.)</i></b> and in <!-#-->26:16f. Paul blends the message of Jesus to<br>
 Ananias with that to him as one. <B>{Before the Gentiles}</B> <b><i>(\en&#333;pion<br>
 t&#333;n ethn&#333;n\)</i></b>. This was the chief element in the call of Saul. He<br>
 was to be an apostle to the Gentiles <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph 3:6-12)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:16 <B>{I will shew}</B> <b><i>(\hupodeix&#333;\)</i></b>. Beforehand as a warning as in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 3:7 and from time to time. <B>{He must suffer}</B> <b><i>(\dei auton<br>
 pathein\)</i></b>. Constative aorist active infinitive <b><i>(\pathein\, from<br>
 \pasch&#333;\)</i></b> covering the whole career of Saul. Suffering is one<br>
 element in the call that Saul receives. He will learn "how many<br>
 things" <b><i>(\hosa\)</i></b> are included in this list by degrees and by<br>
 experience. A glance at <!-#-->2Co 10-12 will show one the fulfilment<br>
 of this prophecy. But it was the "gift" of Christ to Paul to go<br>
 on suffering <b><i>(\paschein\, present infinitive, <!-#-->Php 1:39)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:17 <B>{Laying his hands on him}</B> <b><i>(\epitheis ep' auton tas<br>
 cheiras\)</i></b>. As in the vision Saul saw <b><i>(verse <!-#-->12)</i></b>. <B>{Brother Saul}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Saoul adelphe\)</i></b>. All suspicion has vanished and Ananias takes<br>
 Saul to his heart as a brother in Christ. It was a gracious word<br>
 to Saul now under suspicion on both sides. <B>{The Lord, even Jesus}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ho kurios, I&#275;sous\)</i></b>. Undoubted use of \kurios\ as Lord and<br>
 applied to Jesus. <B>{Who appeared}</B> <b><i>(\ho ophtheis\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive participle of \hora&#333;\, was seen as in <!-#-->26:16 and with<br>
 the dative also <b><i>(\soi\)</i></b>. <B>{Thou camest}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rchou\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 indicative middle, "thou wert coming." <B>{Be filled with the Holy<br>
 Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;stheis pneumatos hagiou\)</i></b>. This enduement of special<br>
 power he will need as an apostle <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b> and as promised by<br>
 Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->1:8; Ga 2:7)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:18 <B>{Fell off}</B> <b><i>(\apepesan\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative<br>
 <b><i>(note--an ending like first aorist)</i></b> of \apopipt&#333;\, old verb, but<br>
 here alone in the N.T. <B>{As if it were scales}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s lepides\)</i></b>.<br>
 Chiefly late word <b><i>(LXX)</i></b> from \lep&#333;\, to peel, and only here in<br>
 the N.T. See Tobit 11:13, "The white film peeled from his eyes"<br>
 <b><i>(\elepisth&#275;\)</i></b>. Luke does not say that actual "scales" fell from<br>
 the eyes of Saul, but that it felt that way to him as his sight<br>
 returned, "as if" <b><i>(\h&#333;s\)</i></b>. Medical writers use the word \lepis\<br>
 for pieces of the skin that fall off <b><i>(Hobart, _Medical Language<br>
 of St. Luke_, p. 39)</i></b>. Luke may have heard Paul tell of this vivid<br>
 experience. <B>{Was baptized}</B> <b><i>(\ebaptisth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative. Apparently by Ananias <b><i>(<!-#-->22:16)</i></b> as a symbol of the<br>
 new life in Christ already begun, possibly in the pool in the<br>
 house of Judas as today water is plentiful in Damascus or in<br>
 Abana or Pharpar <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>, better than all the waters of Israel<br>
 according to Naaman <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ki 5:12)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:19 <B>{Was strengthened}</B> <b><i>(\enischuth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative of \enischu&#333;\, to receive strength <b><i>(\ischus\)</i></b>,<br>
 comparatively late verb and here only in the N.T. save <!-#-->Lu 22:43<br>
 where it is doubtful. Poor verse division. This clause belongs in<br>
 sense to verse <!-#-->18. <B>{Some days}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meras tinas\)</i></b>. An indefinite<br>
 period, probably not long, the early period in Damascus before<br>
 Saul left for Arabia <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 1:13-24)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:20 <B>{He proclaimed Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\ek&#275;russen ton I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 indicative, inchoative, began to preach. Jesus, not Christ, is<br>
 the correct text here. He did this first preaching in the Jewish<br>
 synagogues, a habit of his life when possible, and following the<br>
 example of Jesus. <B>{That he is the Son of God}</B> <b><i>(\hoti houtos estin<br>
 ho huios tou theou\)</i></b>. This is Paul's platform as a Christian<br>
 preacher, one that he always occupied to the very end. It was a<br>
 complete reversal of his previous position. Jesus had turned him<br>
 completely around. It is the conclusion that Saul now drew from<br>
 the vision of the Risen Christ and the message through Ananias.<br>
 By "the Son of God" Saul means the Messiah of promise and hope,<br>
 the Messianic sense of the Baptist <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:34)</i></b> and of Nathanael<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:49)</i></b> for Saul is now proclaiming his faith in Jesus in<br>
 the very synagogues where he had meant to arrest those who<br>
 professed their faith in him. Peter laid emphasis on the<br>
 Resurrection of Jesus as a glorious fact and proclaimed Jesus as<br>
 Lord and Christ. Paul boldly calls Jesus the Son of God with full<br>
 acknowledgment of his deity from the very start. Thomas had come<br>
 to this place slowly <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 20:28)</i></b>. Saul begins with this truth<br>
 and never leaves it. With this faith he can shake the world.<br>
 There is no power in any other preaching.<br>
 <br>
 9:21 <B>{Were amazed}</B> <b><i>(\existanto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle indicative of<br>
 \exist&#275;mi\. They continued to stand out of themselves in<br>
 astonishment at this violent reversal in Saul the persecutor.<br>
 <B>{Made havock}</B> <b><i>(\porth&#275;sas\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle of<br>
 \porthe&#333;\, to lay waste, an old verb, but only here and <!-#-->Ga<br>
 1:13,23 by Paul, an interesting coincidence. It is the old<br>
 proverb about Saul among the prophets <b><i>(<!-#-->1Sa 10:12)</i></b> revived with<br>
 a new meaning <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. <B>{Had come}</B> <b><i>(\el&#275;luthei\)</i></b>. Past perfect<br>
 indicative active. <B>{Might bring}</B> <b><i>(\agag&#275;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 <b><i>(effective)</i></b> active subjunctive of \ag&#333;\ with \hina\ <b><i>(purpose)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Bound}</B> <b><i>(\dedemenous\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of \de&#333;\.<br>
 Interesting tenses.<br>
 <br>
 9:22 <B>{Increased the more}</B> <b><i>(\m&#257;llon enedunamouto\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 passive indicative of \endunamo&#333;\, to receive power <b><i>(late verb)</i></b>,<br>
 progressive increase in strength as opposition grew. Saul's<br>
 recantation stirred controversy and Saul grew in power. See also<br>
 Paul in <!-#-->Php 4:13; 1Ti 1:12; 2Ti 2:1; 4:17; Ro 4:20. Christ, the<br>
 dynamo of spiritual energy, was now pouring power <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 1:8)</i></b> into<br>
 Paul who is already filled with the Holy Spirit <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 9:17)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Confounded}</B> <b><i>(\sunechunnen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active indicative of<br>
 \sunchunn&#333;\ <b><i>(late form of \sunche&#333;\, to pour together, commingle,<br>
  make confusion.)</i></b> The more Saul preached, the more the Jews 
  were<br>
 confused. <B>{Proving}</B> <b><i>(\sunbibaz&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present active participle of<br>
 \sunbibaz&#333;\, old verb to make go together, to coalesce, to knit<br>
 together. It is the very word that Luke will use in <!-#-->16:10 of<br>
 the conclusion reached at Troas concerning the vision of Paul.<br>
 Here Saul took the various items in the life of Jesus of Nazareth<br>
 and found in them the proof that he was in reality "the Messiah"<br>
 <b><i>(\ho Christos\)</i></b>. This method of argument Paul continued to use<br>
 with the Jews <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 17:3)</i></b>. It was irresistible argument and<br>
 spread consternation among the Jews. It was the most powerful<br>
 piece of artillery in the Jewish camp that was suddenly turned<br>
 round upon them. It is probable that at this juncture Saul went<br>
 into Arabia for several years <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 1:12-24)</i></b>. Luke makes no<br>
 mention of this important event, but he leaves ample room for it<br>
 at this point.<br>
 <br>
 9:23 <B>{When many days were fulfilled}</B> <b><i>(\H&#333;s epl&#275;rounto h&#275;merai<br>
 hikanai\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive indicative of \pl&#275;ro&#333;\, old and<br>
 common verb, were in process of being fulfilled. How "many"<br>
 <b><i>(considerable, \hikanai\, common word for a long period)</i></b> Luke<br>
 does not say nor does he say that Saul spent all of this period<br>
 in Damascus, as we know from <!-#-->Ga 1:16-18 was not the case. Paul<br>
 there states definitely that he went away from Damascus to Arabia<br>
 and returned there before going back to Jerusalem and that the<br>
 whole period was about "three years" which need not mean three<br>
 full years, but at least portions of three. Most of the three<br>
 years was probably spent in Arabia because of the two explosions<br>
 in Damascus <b><i>(before his departure and on his return)</i></b> and because<br>
 he was unknown in Jerusalem as a Christian on his arrival there.<br>
 It cannot be argued from the frequent lacunae in the Acts that<br>
 Luke tells all that was true or that he knew. He had his own<br>
 methods and aims as every historian has. We are at perfect<br>
 liberty to supplement the narrative in the Acts with items from<br>
 Paul's Epistles. So we must assume the return of Saul from Arabia<br>
 at this juncture, between verses <!-#-->22,23, when Saul resumed his<br>
 preaching in the Jewish synagogues with renewed energy and grasp<br>
 after the period of mature reflection and readjustment in Arabia.<br>
 <B>{Took counsel together}</B> <b><i>(\sunebouleusanto\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 <b><i>(effective)</i></b> middle indicative of \sunbouleu&#333;\, old and common<br>
 verb for counselling <b><i>(\bouleu&#333;\)</i></b> together <b><i>(\sun\)</i></b>. Things had<br>
 reached a climax. It was worse than before he left for Arabia.<br>
 Paul was now seeing the fulfilment of the prophecy of Jesus about<br>
 him <b><i>(<!-#-->9:16)</i></b>. <B>{To kill him}</B> <b><i>(\anelein auton\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 <b><i>(effective)</i></b> active infinitive of \anaire&#333;\, to take up, to make<br>
 away with, to kill <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:32; Ac 12:1, etc.)</i></b>. The infinitive<br>
 expresses purpose here as is done in verse <!-#-->24 by \hop&#333;s\ and<br>
 the aorist active subjunctive of the same verb <b><i>(\anel&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Saul<br>
 now knew what Stephen had suffered at his hands as his own life<br>
 was in peril in the Jewish quarter of Damascus. It was a picture<br>
 of his old self. He may even have been scourged here <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co<br>
 11:24)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:24 <B>{Plot}</B> <b><i>(\epiboul&#275;\)</i></b>. Old word for a plan <b><i>(\boul&#275;\)</i></b> against<br>
 <b><i>(\epi\)</i></b> one. In the N.T. only in Acts <b><i>(<!-#-->9:24; 20:3,19; 23:30)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{They watched}</B> <b><i>(\paret&#275;rounto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle indicative of<br>
 \parat&#275;re&#333;\, common verb in late Greek for watching beside<br>
 <b><i>(\para\)</i></b> or insidiously or on the sly as in <!-#-->Lu 6:7, they kept<br>
 on watching by day and night to kill him. In <!-#-->2Co 11:32 Paul<br>
 says that the Ethnarch of Aretas "kept guard" <b><i>(\ephrourei\,<br>
 imperfect active of \phroure&#333;\)</i></b> to seize him. Probably the Jews<br>
 obtained the consent of the Ethnarch and had him appoint some of<br>
 them as guards or watchers at the gate of the city.<br>
 <br>
 9:25 <B>{Through the wall}</B> <b><i>(\dia tou teichous\)</i></b>. Paul in <!-#-->2Co 11:33<br>
 explains \dia tou teichous\ as being \dia thuridos\ <b><i>(through a<br>
 window)</i></b> which opened into the house on the inside of the wall as<br>
 is true today in Damascus as Hackett saw there. See <!-#-->Jos 2:15f.<br>
 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1Sa 19:12)</i></b> for the way that Rahab let out the spies "by a<br>
 cord through the window." <B>{Lowering him}</B> <b><i>(\auton chalasantes\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active participle of \chala&#333;\, old and common verb<br>
 in a nautical sense <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 27:17,30)</i></b> as well as otherwise as here.<br>
 Same verb used by Paul of this experience <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:33)</i></b>. <B>{In a<br>
 basket}</B> <b><i>(\en sphuridi\)</i></b>. The word used when the four thousand<br>
 were fed <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 8:8; Mt 15:37)</i></b>. A large basket plaited of reeds<br>
 and distinguished in <!-#-->Mr 8:19f. <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 16:9f.)</i></b> from the smaller<br>
 \kophinos\. Paul uses \sargan&#275;\, a basket made of ropes. This<br>
 escape by night by the help of the men whom he had come to<br>
 destroy was a shameful memory to Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:33)</i></b>. Wendt thinks<br>
 that the coincidences in language here prove that Luke had read<br>
 II Corinthians. That, of course, is quite possible.<br>
 <br>
 9:26 <B>{He assayed}</B> <b><i>(\epeirazen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of conative<br>
 action. <B>{To join himself}</B> <b><i>(\kollasthai\)</i></b>. Present middle <b><i>(direct)</i></b><br>
 infinitive of conative action again. Same word \kolla&#333;\ in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 15:15; Ac 10:28. See on &#175;Mt 19:5 for discussion. <B>{Were all<br>
 afraid of him}</B> <b><i>(\pantes ephobounto auton\)</i></b>. They were fearing<br>
 him. Imperfect middle picturing the state of mind of the<br>
 disciples who had vivid recollections of his conduct when last<br>
 here. What memories Saul had on this return journey to Jerusalem<br>
 after three years. He had left a conquering hero of Pharisaism.<br>
 He returns distrusted by the disciples and regarded by the<br>
 Pharisees as a renegade and a turncoat. He made no effort to get<br>
 in touch with the Sanhedrin who had sent him to Damascus. He had<br>
 escaped the plots of the Jews in Damascus only to find himself<br>
 the object of suspicion by the disciples in Jerusalem who had no<br>
 proof of his sincerity in his alleged conversion. <B>{Not believing}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275; pisteuontes\)</i></b>. They had probably heard of his conversion,<br>
 but they frankly disbelieved the reports and regarded him as a<br>
 hypocrite or a spy in a new role to ruin them. <B>{Was}</B> <b><i>(\estin\)</i></b>.<br>
 The present tense is here retained in indirect discourse<br>
 according to the common Greek idiom.<br>
 <br>
 9:27 <B>{Took him}</B> <b><i>(\epilabomenos\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle <b><i>(indirect)</i></b><br>
 participle of \epilamban&#333;\, common verb to lay hold of. Barnabas<br>
 saw the situation and took Saul to himself and listened to his<br>
 story and believed it. It is to the credit of Barnabas that he<br>
 had the insight and the courage to stand by Saul at the crucial<br>
 moment in his life when the evidence seemed to be against him. It<br>
 is a pleasing hypothesis that this influential disciple from<br>
 Cyprus had gone to the University of Tarsus where he met Saul. If<br>
 so, he would know more of him than those who only knew his record<br>
 as a persecutor of Christians. That fact Barnabas knew also, but<br>
 he was convinced that Jesus had changed the heart of Saul and he<br>
 used his great influence <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 4:36; 11:22)</i></b> to win the favour of<br>
 the apostles, Peter in particular <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 1:19)</i></b> and James the<br>
 half-brother of Jesus. The other apostles were probably out of<br>
 the city as Paul says that he did not see them. <B>{To the apostles}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pros tous apostolous\)</i></b>. Both Barnabas and James are termed<br>
 apostles in the general sense, though not belonging to the<br>
 twelve, as Paul did not, though himself later a real apostle. So<br>
 Barnabas introduced Saul to Peter and vouched for his story,<br>
 declared it fully <b><i>(\di&#275;g&#275;sato\, in detail)</i></b> including Saul's<br>
 vision of Jesus <b><i>(\eiden ton kurion\)</i></b> as the vital thing and<br>
 Christ's message to Saul <b><i>(\elal&#275;sen aut&#333;i\)</i></b> and Saul's bold<br>
 preaching <b><i>(\&#275;parr&#275;siasato\, first aorist middle indicative of<br>
 \parr&#275;siaz&#333;\ from \pan--r&#275;sia\ telling it all as in <!-#-->Ac 2:29)</i></b>.<br>
 Peter was convinced and Saul was his guest for two weeks <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga<br>
 1:18)</i></b> with delightful fellowship <b><i>(\histor&#275;sai\)</i></b>. He had really<br>
 come to Jerusalem mainly "to visit" <b><i>(to see)</i></b> Peter, but not to<br>
 receive a commission from him. He had that from the Lord <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga<br>
 1:1f.)</i></b>. Both Peter and James could tell Saul of their special<br>
 experiences with the Risen Christ. Furneaux thinks that Peter was<br>
 himself staying at the home of Mary the mother of John Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 12:12)</i></b> who was a cousin of Barnabas <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 4:10)</i></b>. This is quite<br>
 possible. At any rate Saul is now taken into the inner circle of<br>
 the disciples in Jerusalem.<br>
 <br>
 9:28 <B>{Going in and going out}</B> <b><i>(\eisporeumenos kai<br>
 ekporeuomenos\)</i></b>. Barnabas and Peter and James opened all the<br>
 doors for Saul and the fear of the disciples vanished.<br>
 <br>
 9:29 <B>{Preaching boldly}</B> <b><i>(\parr&#275;siazomenos\)</i></b>. For a while.<br>
 Evidently Saul did not extend his preaching outside of Jerusalem<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 1:22)</i></b> and in the city preached mainly in the synagogues of<br>
 the Hellenists <b><i>(\pros tous Hellenistas\)</i></b> as Stephen had done <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 8:9)</i></b>. As a Cilician Jew he knew how to speak to the Hellenists.<br>
 <B>{Disputed}</B> <b><i>(\sunez&#275;tei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \sunz&#275;te&#333;\, the<br>
 very verb used in <!-#-->6:9 of the disputes with Stephen in these<br>
 very synagogues in one of which <b><i>(Cilicia)</i></b> Saul had probably<br>
 joined issue with Stephen to his own discomfort. It was<br>
 intolerable to these Hellenistic Jews now to hear Saul taking the<br>
 place of Stephen and using the very arguments that Stephen had<br>
 employed. <B>{But they went about to kill him}</B> <b><i>(\Hoi de epecheiroun<br>
 anelein auton\)</i></b>. Demonstrative \hoi\ with \de\ and the conative<br>
 imperfect of \epicheire&#333;\, to put the hand to, to try, an old<br>
 verb used in the N.T. only three times <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:1; Ac 9:29; 19:3)</i></b>.<br>
 They offer to Saul the same conclusive answer that he gave to<br>
 Stephen, death. Paul tells how the Lord Jesus appeared to him at<br>
 this juncture in a vision in the temple <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 22:17-21)</i></b> with the<br>
 distinct command to leave Jerusalem and how Paul protested that<br>
 he was willing to meet the fate of Stephen in whose death he had<br>
 a shameful part. That is to Saul's credit, but the Lord did not<br>
 want Saul to be put to death yet. His crown of martyrdom will<br>
 come later.<br>
 <br>
 9:30 <B>{Knew it}</B> <b><i>(\epignontes\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of<br>
 \epigin&#333;sk&#333;\, to know fully. The disciples saw it clearly, so<br>
 they <B>{conducted}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;gagon\, effective second aorist active<br>
 indicative of \katag&#333;\)</i></b>. <B>{Sent forth}</B> <b><i>(\exapesteilan\)</i></b>. Double<br>
 compound <b><i>(\ex\, out, \apo\, away or off)</i></b>. Sent him out and off<br>
 <B>{to Tarsus}</B> <b><i>(\eis Tarson\)</i></b>. Silence is preserved by Luke. But it<br>
 takes little imagination to picture the scene at home when this<br>
 brilliant young rabbi, the pride of Gamaliel, returns home a<br>
 preacher of the despised Jesus of Nazareth whose disciples he had<br>
 so relentlessly persecuted. What will father, mother, sister<br>
 think of him now?<br>
 <br>
 9:31 <B>{So the church}</B> <b><i>(\H&#275; men oun ekkl&#275;sia\)</i></b>. The singular<br>
 \ekkl&#275;sia\ is undoubtedly the true reading here <b><i>(all the great<br>
 documents have it so)</i></b>. By this time there were churches scattered<br>
 over Judea, Galilee, and Samaria <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 1:22)</i></b>, but Luke either<br>
 regards the disciples in Palestine as still members of the one<br>
 great church in Jerusalem <b><i>(instance already the work of Philip in<br>
 Samaria and soon of Peter in Joppa and Caesarea)</i></b> or he employs<br>
 the term \ekkl&#275;sia\ in a geographical or collective sense<br>
 covering all of Palestine. The strictly local sense we have seen<br>
 already in <!-#-->8:1,3 <b><i>(and <!-#-->Mt 18:17)</i></b> and the general spiritual<br>
 sense in <!-#-->Mt 16:18. But in <!-#-->Ac 8:3 it is plain that the term is<br>
 applied to the organization of Jerusalem Christians even when<br>
 scattered in their homes. The use of \men oun\ <b><i>(so)</i></b> is Luke's<br>
 common way of gathering up the connection. The obvious meaning is<br>
 that the persecution ceased because the persecutor had been<br>
 converted. The wolf no longer ravined the sheep. It is true also<br>
 that the effort of Caligula A.D. 39 to set up his image in the<br>
 temple in Jerusalem for the Jews to worship greatly excited the<br>
 Jews and gave them troubles of their own <b><i>(Josephus, _Ant_. XVIII.<br>
 8, 2-9)</i></b>. <B>{Had peace}</B> <b><i>(\eichen eir&#275;n&#275;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. Kept<br>
 on having peace, enjoying peace, because the persecution had<br>
 ceased. Many of the disciples came back to Jerusalem and the<br>
 apostles began to make preaching tours out from the city. This<br>
 idiom <b><i>(\ech&#333; eir&#275;n&#275;n\)</i></b> occurs again in <!-#-->Ro 5:1 <b><i>(\eir&#275;n&#275;n<br>
 ech&#333;men\, present active subjunctive)</i></b> where it has been<br>
 grievously misunderstood. There it is an exhortation to keep on<br>
 enjoying the peace with God already made, not to make peace with<br>
 God which would be \eir&#275;n&#275;n sch&#333;men\ <b><i>(ingressive aorist<br>
 subjunctive)</i></b>. <B>{Edified}</B> <b><i>(\oikodomoumen&#275;\)</i></b>. Present passive<br>
 participle, linear action also. One result of the enjoyment of<br>
 peace after the persecution was the continued edification <b><i>(Latin<br>
 word _aedificatio_ for building up a house)</i></b>, a favourite figure<br>
 with Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 14; Eph 3)</i></b> and scattered throughout the N.T.,<br>
 old Greek verb. In <!-#-->1Pe 2:5 Peter speaks of "the spiritual<br>
 house" throughout the five Roman provinces being "built up" <b><i>(cf.<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 16:18)</i></b>. <B>{In the comfort of the Holy Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i parakl&#275;sei<br>
 tou hagiou pneumatos\)</i></b>. Either locative <b><i>(<B>{in}</B>)</i></b> or instrumental<br>
 case <b><i>(<B>{by}</B>)</i></b>. The Holy Spirit had been promised by Jesus as<br>
 "another Paraclete" and now this is shown to be true. The only<br>
 instance in Acts of the use of \parakl&#275;sis\ with the Holy Spirit.<br>
 The word, of course, means calling to one's side <b><i>(\parakale&#333;\)</i></b><br>
 either for advice or for consolation. <B>{Was multiplied}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epl&#275;thuneto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle passive. The multiplication of<br>
 the disciples kept pace with the peace, the edification, the<br>
 walking in the fear of the Lord, the comfort of the Holy Spirit.<br>
 The blood of the martyrs was already becoming the seed of the<br>
 church. Stephen had not borne his witness in vain.<br>
 <br>
 9:32 <B>{Lydda}</B> <b><i>(\Ludda\)</i></b>. In O.T. Lod <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ch 8:12)</i></b> and near Joppa.<br>
 Later Diospolis.<br>
 <br>
 9:33 <B>{Aenias}</B> <b><i>(\Ainean\)</i></b>. Old Greek name and so probably a<br>
 Hellenistic Jew. He was apparently a disciple already <b><i>(the saint,<br>
 verse <!-#-->32)</i></b>. Luke the physician notes that he had been bed ridden<br>
 for eight years. See on &#175;5:15 for "bed" <b><i>(\krabattou\)</i></b> and &#175;8:7;<br>
 Lu 5:18 for "paralyzed" <b><i>(\paralelumenos\, perfect passive<br>
 participle of \paralu&#333;\ with \&#275;n\, periphrastic past perfect<br>
 passive)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:34 <B>{Healeth}</B> <b><i>(\i&#257;tai\)</i></b>. Aoristic present middle indicative,<br>
 heals here and now. <B>{Make thy bed}</B> <b><i>(\str&#333;son seaut&#333;i\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active imperative of \str&#333;nnumi\ <b><i>(\-u&#333;\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 word with "bed" <b><i>(\krabatton\)</i></b> understood as the object.<br>
 Literally, spread thy bed for thyself <b><i>(dative case)</i></b>, what others<br>
 for eight years have done for thee.<br>
 <br>
 9:35 <B>{Sharon}</B> <b><i>(\Sar&#333;na\)</i></b>. The Plain of Sharon, not a town. Thirty<br>
 miles long from Joppa to Caesarea.<br>
 <br>
 9:36 <B>{At Joppa}</B> <b><i>(\En Iopp&#275;i\)</i></b>. The modern Jaffa, the port of<br>
 Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ch 2:16)</i></b>. <B>{Disciple}</B> <b><i>(\math&#275;tria\)</i></b>. Feminine form<br>
 of \math&#275;t&#275;s\, a learner from \manthan&#333;\, to learn, a late word<br>
 and only here in the N.T. <B>{Tabitha}</B> <b><i>(\Tabeitha\)</i></b>. Aramaic form of<br>
 the Hebrew _Tsebi_ and, like the Greek word <B>{Dorcas}</B> <b><i>(\Dorkas\)</i></b>,<br>
 means Gazelle, "the creature with the beautiful look" <b><i>(or eyes)</i></b>,<br>
 from \derkomai\. The gazelle was a favourite type for beauty in<br>
 the orient <b><i>(Song of Solomon <!-#-->2:9,17; 4:5; 7:3)</i></b>. She may have had<br>
 both the Aramaic and the Greek name, Tabitha Dorcas like John<br>
 Mark. There is nothing said about a husband and so she was<br>
 probably unmarried. She is the second woman mentioned by name<br>
 after Pentecost <b><i>(Sapphira the other)</i></b>. She did her beautiful deeds<br>
 by herself. She did not have a Dorcas society. <B>{Did}</B> <b><i>(\epoiei\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active, her habit.<br>
 <br>
 9:37 <B>{In an upper chamber}</B> <b><i>(\en huper&#333;i&#333;i\)</i></b>. See on &#175;1:13. Also<br>
 in verse <!-#-->39. In that house. This service was rendered by the<br>
 women, though Luke has \lousantes\ <b><i>(masculine plural aorist<br>
 active participle of \lou&#333;\)</i></b>, a general way of saying "they<br>
 washed." The interment was not hurried as in Jerusalem <b><i>(Ananias<br>
 and Sapphira)</i></b> and the upper room is where the body was usually<br>
 placed.<br>
 <br>
 9:38 <B>{Delay not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; okn&#275;s&#275;is\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist active<br>
 subjunctive in prohibition. Direct discourse and not indirect as<br>
 late MSS. have <b><i>(aorist active infinitive, \okn&#275;sai\)</i></b>. Possibly<br>
 the two messengers started before Dorcas was quite dead, though<br>
 we do not know. Peter had recently healed Aeneas and the<br>
 disciples may have had faith enough to believe that he could<br>
 raise the dead by the power of Christ. W. M. Ramsay doubts if<br>
 Dorcas was really dead, but why see legends in these supernatural<br>
 events?<br>
 <br>
 9:39 <B>{Stood by him}</B> <b><i>(\parest&#275;san aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative, intransitive, of \parist&#275;mi\)</i></b>. Vivid picture of this<br>
 group of widows as they stood around Peter, weeping <b><i>(\klaiousai\)</i></b><br>
 and showing <b><i>(\epideiknumenai\, present middle as belonging to<br>
 themselves, pointing with pride to)</i></b> the very inner garments<br>
 <b><i>(\chit&#333;nas\)</i></b> and outer garments <b><i>(\himatia\)</i></b>, like the Latin<br>
 _tunica_ and _toga_, which she made from time to time <b><i>(\epoiei\,<br>
 imperfect active, repeated action)</i></b>. It was a heart-breaking<br>
 scene.<br>
 <br>
 9:40 <B>{Put them all forth}</B> <b><i>(\ekbal&#333;n ex&#333; pantas\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 <b><i>(effective)</i></b> active participle of \ekball&#333;\, a rather strong word,<br>
 perhaps with some difficulty. Cf. <!-#-->Mr 5:40 which incident Peter<br>
 may have recalled. The words are not genuine in <!-#-->Lu 8:54.<br>
 Peter's praying alone reminds one of Elijah <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ki 17:20)</i></b> and the<br>
 widow's son and Elisha for the Shunammite's son <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ki 4:33)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Tabitha, arise}</B> <b><i>(\Tabeitha, anast&#275;thi\)</i></b>. With sublime faith like<br>
 \Taleitha koum\ of Jesus in <!-#-->Mr 5:41. <B>{She sat up}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anekathisen\)</i></b>. Effective aorist active indicative of<br>
 \anakathiz&#333;\. Often in medical writers, only here in the N.T. and<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 7:15 where Westcott and Hort have in the margin the<br>
 uncompounded form \ekathisen\. Vivid picture.<br>
 <br>
 9:41 <B>{Raised her up}</B> <b><i>(\anest&#275;sen aut&#275;n\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative, transitive, of \anist&#275;mi\. <B>{Presented}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\parest&#275;sen\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative, transitive of<br>
 \parist&#275;mi\ <b><i>(cf. intransitive second aorist in verse <!-#-->39 above)</i></b>.<br>
 It was a joyful time for Peter, the widows, all the saints, and<br>
 for Dorcas.<br>
 <br>
 9:43 <B>{Many days}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meras hikanas\)</i></b>. See on verse &#175;23. Luke is<br>
 fond of the phrase and uses it for time, number, size. It might<br>
 be "ten days, ten months, or ten years" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. <B>{With one Simon a<br>
 tanner}</B> <b><i>(\para tini Sim&#333;ni bursei\)</i></b>. The use of \para\ is usual<br>
 for staying with one <b><i>(by his side)</i></b>. "The more scrupulous Jews<br>
 regarded such an occupation as unclean, and avoided those who<br>
 pursued it. The conduct of Peter here shows that he did not carry<br>
 his prejudices to that extent" <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>. One of the rabbis said:<br>
 "It is impossible for the world to do without tanners; but woe to<br>
 him who is a tanner." A Jewess could sue for divorce if she<br>
 discovered that her husband was a tanner. And yet Peter will have<br>
 scruples on the housetop in the tanner's house about eating food<br>
 considered unclean. "The lodging with the tanner was a step on<br>
 the road to eating with a Gentile" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
