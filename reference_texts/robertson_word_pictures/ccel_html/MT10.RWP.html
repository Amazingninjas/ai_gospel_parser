<p>10:1 <B>{His twelve disciples}</B> <b><i>(\tous d&#333;deka math&#275;tas autou\)</i></b>. First<br>
 mention of the group of "learners" by Matthew and assumed as<br>
 already in existence <b><i>(note the article)</i></b> as they were <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 3:14)</i></b>.<br>
 They were chosen before the Sermon on the Mount was delivered,<br>
 but Matthew did not mention it in connection with that sermon.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Gave them authority}</B> <b><i>(\ed&#333;ken autois exousian\)</i></b>. "Power"<br>
 <b><i>(Moffatt, Goodspeed)</i></b>. One may be surprised that here only the<br>
 healing work is mentioned, though Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:2)</i></b> has it "to<br>
 preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick." And Matthew<br>
 says <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:7)</i></b>, "And as ye go, preach." Hence it is not fair to<br>
 say that Matthew knows only the charge to heal the sick,<br>
 important as that is. The physical distress was great, but the<br>
 spiritual even greater. Power is more likely the idea of<br>
 \exousia\ here. This healing ministry attracted attention and did<br>
 a vast deal of good. Today we have hospitals and skilled<br>
 physicians and nurses, but we should not deny the power of God to<br>
 bless all these agencies and to cure disease as he wills. Jesus<br>
 is still the master of soul and body. But intelligent faith does<br>
 not justify us in abstaining from the help of the physician who<br>
 must not be confounded with the quack and the charlatan.<br>
 <br>
 10:2 <B>{The names of the twelve apostles}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n d&#333;deka apostol&#333;n ta<br>
 onomata\)</i></b>. This is the official name <b><i>(missionaries)</i></b> used here by<br>
 Matthew for the first time. The names are given here, but Matthew<br>
 does not say that they were chosen at this time. Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 3:13-19)</i></b> and Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:12-16)</i></b> state that Jesus "chose" them,<br>
 "appointed" them after a night of prayer in the mountain and came<br>
 down with them and then delivered the Sermon <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:17)</i></b>. Simon<br>
 heads the list <b><i>(\pr&#333;tos\)</i></b> in all four lists including <!-#-->Ac 1:13f.<br>
 He came to be first and foremost at the great Pentecost <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 2<br>
 and <!-#-->Ac 3)</i></b>. The apostles disputed a number of times as to which<br>
 was greatest. Judas Iscariot comes last each time save that he is<br>
 absent in Acts, being already dead. Matthew calls him the<br>
 betrayer <b><i>(\ho paradidous\)</i></b>. Iscariot is usually explained as "man<br>
 of Kerioth" down near Edom <b><i>(<!-#-->Jos 15:25)</i></b>. Philip comes fifth and<br>
 James the son of Alphaeus the ninth. Bartholomew is the name for<br>
 Nathanael. Thaddaeus is Judas the brother of James. Simon Zelotes<br>
 is also called Simon the Canaanean <b><i>(Zealous, Hebrew word)</i></b>. This<br>
 is apparently their first preaching and healing tour without<br>
 Jesus. He sends them forth by twos <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 6:7)</i></b>. Matthew names them<br>
 in pairs, probably as they were sent out.<br>
 <br>
 10:5 <B>{These twelve Jesus sent forth}</B> <b><i>(\toutous tous d&#333;deka<br>
 apesteilen ho I&#275;sous\)</i></b>. The word "sent forth" <b><i>(\apesteilen\)</i></b> is<br>
 the same root as "apostles." The same word reappears in <!-#-->10:16.<br>
 <B>{Way of the Gentiles}</B> <b><i>(\hodon ethn&#333;n\)</i></b>. Objective genitive, way<br>
 leading to the Gentiles. This prohibition against going among the<br>
 Gentiles and the Samaritans was for this special tour. They were<br>
 to give the Jews the first opportunity and not to prejudice the<br>
 cause at this stage. Later Jesus will order them to go and<br>
 disciple all the Gentiles <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 28:19)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:6 <B>{The lost sheep}</B> <b><i>(\ta probata ta apol&#333;lota\)</i></b>. The sheep, the<br>
 lost ones. Mentioned here first by Matthew. Jesus uses it not in<br>
 blame, but in pity <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Bengel notes that Jesus says "lost"<br>
 more frequently than "led astray." "If the Jewish nation could be<br>
 brought to repentance the new age would dawn" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:7 <B>{As ye go, preach}</B> <b><i>(\poreuomenoi k&#275;russete\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 participle and present imperative. They were itinerant preachers<br>
 on a "preaching tour," heralds <b><i>(\k&#275;rukes\)</i></b> proclaiming good news.<br>
 The summary message is the same as that of the Baptist <b><i>(<!-#-->3:2)</i></b><br>
 that first startled the country, "the kingdom of heaven has drawn<br>
 nigh." He echoed it up and down the Jordan Valley. They are to<br>
 shake Galilee with it as Jesus had done <b><i>(<!-#-->4:17)</i></b>. That same<br>
 amazing message is needed today. But "the apprentice apostles"<br>
 <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b> could tell not a little about the King of the Kingdom who<br>
 was with them.<br>
 <br>
 10:9 <B>{Get you no gold}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; kt&#275;s&#275;sthe\)</i></b>. It is not, "Do not<br>
 possess" or "own," but "do not acquire" or "procure" for<br>
 yourselves, indirect middle aorist subjunctive. Gold, silver,<br>
 brass <b><i>(copper)</i></b> in a descending scale <b><i>(nor even bronze)</i></b>. <B>{In your<br>
 purses}</B> <b><i>(\eis tas z&#333;nas h&#8211;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. In your girdles or belts used<br>
 for carrying money.<br>
 <br>
 10:10 <B>{No wallet}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; p&#275;ran\)</i></b>. Better than "scrip." It can be<br>
 either a travelling or bread bag. Deissmann <b><i>(_Light from the<br>
 Ancient East_, pp. 108f.)</i></b> shows that it can mean the beggar's<br>
 collecting bag as in an inscription on a monument at Kefr Hanar<br>
 in Syria: "While Christianity was still young the beggar priest<br>
 was making his rounds in the land of Syria on behalf of the<br>
 national goddess." Deissmann also quotes a pun in the<br>
 _Didaskalia=Const. Apost_. 3, 6 about some itinerant widows who<br>
 said that they were not so much \ch&#275;rai\ <b><i>(spouseless)</i></b> as \p&#275;rai\<br>
 <b><i>(pouchless)</i></b>. He cites also Shakespeare, _Troilus and Cressida_<br>
 III. iii. 145: "Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back, wherein<br>
 he puts alms for oblivion." <B>{For the labourer is worthy of his<br>
 food}</B> <b><i>(\axios gar ho ergat&#275;s t&#275;s troph&#275;s autou\)</i></b>. The sermon is<br>
 worth the dinner, in other words. Luke in the charge to the<br>
 seventy <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 10:7)</i></b> has the same words with \misthou\ <b><i>(reward)</i></b><br>
 instead of \troph&#275;s\ <b><i>(food)</i></b>. In <!-#-->1Ti 5:18 Paul quotes Luke's<br>
 form as scripture <b><i>(\h&#275; graph&#275;\)</i></b> or as a well-known saying if<br>
 confined to the first quotation. The word for workman here<br>
 <b><i>(\ergat&#275;s\)</i></b> is that used by Jesus in the prayer for labourers<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 9:38)</i></b>. The well-known _Didach&#275;_ or _Teaching of the Twelve_<br>
 <b><i>(xiii)</i></b> shows that in the second century there was still a felt<br>
 need for care on the subject of receiving pay for preaching. The<br>
 travelling sophists added also to the embarrassment of the<br>
 situation. The wisdom of these restrictions was justified in<br>
 Galilee at this time. Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 6:6-13)</i></b> and Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:1-6)</i></b><br>
 vary slightly from Matthew in some of the details of the<br>
 instructions of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 10:13 <B>{If the house be worthy}</B> <b><i>(\ean &#275;i h&#275; oikia axia\)</i></b>. Third<br>
 class condition. What makes a house worthy? "It would naturally<br>
 be readiness to receive the preachers and their message"<br>
 <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. Hospitality is one of the noblest graces and preachers<br>
 receive their share of it. The apostles are not to be burdensome<br>
 as guests.<br>
 <br>
 10:14 <B>{Shake off the dust}</B> <b><i>(\ektinaxate ton koniorton\)</i></b>. Shake<br>
 out, a rather violent gesture of disfavour. The Jews had violent<br>
 prejudices against the smallest particles of Gentile dust, not as<br>
 a purveyor of disease of which they did not know, but because it<br>
 was regarded as the putrescence of death. If the apostles were<br>
 mistreated by a host or hostess, they were to be treated as if<br>
 they were Gentiles <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mt 18:17; Ac 18:6)</i></b>. Here again we have<br>
 a restriction that was for this special tour with its peculiar<br>
 perils.<br>
 <br>
 10:15 <B>{More tolerable}</B> <b><i>(\anektoteron\)</i></b>. The papyri use this<br>
 adjective of a convalescent. People in their vernacular today<br>
 speak of feeling "tolerable." The Galileans were having more<br>
 privileges than Sodom and Gomorrah had.<br>
 <br>
 10:16 <B>{As sheep in the midst of wolves}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s probata en mes&#333;i<br>
 luk&#333;n\)</i></b>. The presence of wolves on every hand was a fact then and<br>
 now. Some of these very sheep <b><i>(<!-#-->10:6)</i></b> at the end will turn out<br>
 to be wolves and cry for Christ's crucifixion. The situation<br>
 called for consummate wisdom and courage. The serpent was the<br>
 emblem of wisdom or shrewdness, intellectual keenness <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 3:1;<br>
 Ps 58:5)</i></b>, the dove of simplicity <b><i>(<!-#-->Ho 7:11)</i></b>. It was a proverb,<br>
 this combination, but one difficult of realization. Either<br>
 without the other is bad <b><i>(rascality or gullibility)</i></b>. The first<br>
 clause with \arnas\ for \probata\ is in <!-#-->Lu 10:3 and apparently<br>
 is in a _Fragment of a Lost Gospel_ edited by Grenfell and Hunt.<br>
 The combination of wariness and innocence is necessary for the<br>
 protection of the sheep and the discomfiture of the wolves. For<br>
 "harmless" <b><i>(\akeraioi\)</i></b> Moffatt and Goodspeed have "guileless,"<br>
 Weymouth "innocent." The word means "unmixed" <b><i>(\a\ privative and<br>
 \kerannumi\)</i></b>, "unadulterated," "simple," "unalloyed."<br>
 <br>
 10:17 <B>{Beware of men}</B> <b><i>(\prosechete apo t&#333;n anthr&#333;p&#333;n\)</i></b>. Ablative<br>
 case with \apo\. Hold your mind <b><i>(\noun\ understood)</i></b> away from.<br>
 The article with \anthr&#333;p&#333;n\ points back to \luk&#333;n\ <b><i>(wolves)</i></b> in<br>
 <!-#-->10:16.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{To councils}</B> <b><i>(\eis sunedria\)</i></b>. The local courts of justice in<br>
 every Jewish town. The word is an old one from Herodotus on for<br>
 any deliberative body <b><i>(\concilium\)</i></b>. The same word is used for<br>
 the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem. <B>{In their synagogues}</B> <b><i>(\en tois<br>
 sunag&#333;gais aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Here not merely as the place of assembly for<br>
 worship, but as an assembly of justice exercising discipline as<br>
 when the man born blind was cast out of the synagogue <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 9:35)</i></b>. They were now after the exile in every town of any size<br>
 where Jews were.<br>
 <br>
 10:19 <B>{Be not anxious}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; merimn&#275;s&#275;te\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist<br>
 subjunctive in prohibition. "Do not become anxious" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 6:31)</i></b>.<br>
 "Self-defence before Jewish kings and heathen governors would be<br>
 a terrible ordeal for humble Galileans. The injunction applied to<br>
 cases when preparation of a speech would be impossible"<br>
 <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. "It might well alarm the bravest of these simple<br>
 fishermen to be told that they would have to answer for their<br>
 doings on Christ's behalf before Jewish councils and heathen<br>
 courts" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. Christ is not talking about preparation of<br>
 sermons. "<B>{In that hour}</B>" <b><i>(\en ekein&#275;i t&#275;i h&#333;r&#257;i\)</i></b>, if not<br>
 before. The Spirit of your Father will speak to you and through<br>
 you <b><i>(<!-#-->10:20)</i></b>. Here is no posing as martyr or courting a martyr's<br>
 crown, but real heroism with full loyalty to Christ.<br>
 <br>
 10:22 <B>{Ye shall be hated}</B> <b><i>(\esesthe misoumenoi\)</i></b>. Periphrastic<br>
 future passive, linear action. It will go on through the ages.<br>
 <B>{For my name's sake}</B> <b><i>(\dia to onoma mou\)</i></b>. In the O.T. as in the<br>
 Targums and the Talmud "the name" as here stands for the person<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 19:29; Ac 5:41; 9:16; 15:26)</i></b>. "He that endureth to the end"<br>
 <b><i>(\ho hupomeinas eis telos\)</i></b>. Effective aorist participle with<br>
 future indicative.<br>
 <br>
 10:23 <B>{Till the Son of man be come}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s elth&#275;i ho huios tou<br>
 anthr&#333;pou\)</i></b>. Moffatt puts it "before the Son of man arrives" as<br>
 if Jesus referred to this special tour of Galilee. Jesus could<br>
 overtake them. Possibly so, but it is by no means clear. Some<br>
 refer it to the Transfiguration, others to the coming of the Holy<br>
 Spirit at Pentecost, others to the Second Coming. Some hold that<br>
 Matthew has put the saying in the wrong context. Others bluntly<br>
 say that Jesus was mistaken, a very serious charge to make in his<br>
 instructions to these preachers. The use of \he&#333;s\ with aorist<br>
 subjunctive for a future event is a good Greek idiom.<br>
 <br>
 10:25 <B>{Beelzebub}</B> <b><i>(\beezeboul\ according to B, \beelzeboul\ by<br>
 most Greek MSS., \beelzeboub\ by many non-Greek MSS.)</i></b>. The<br>
 etymology of the word is also unknown, whether "lord of a<br>
 dwelling" with a pun on "the master of the house"<br>
 <b><i>(\oikodespot&#275;n\)</i></b> or "lord of flies" or "lord of dung" or "lord of<br>
 idolatrous sacrifices." It is evidently a term of reproach. "An<br>
 opprobrious epithet; exact form of the word and meaning of the<br>
 name have given more trouble to commentators than it is all<br>
 worth" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mt 12:24.<br>
 <br>
 10:26 <B>{Fear them not therefore}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; oun phob&#275;th&#275;te autous\)</i></b>.<br>
 Repeated in verses <!-#-->28 and <!-#-->31 <b><i>(\m&#275; phobeisthe\ present middle<br>
 imperative here in contrast with aorist passive subjunctive in<br>
 the preceding prohibitions)</i></b>. Note also the accusative case with<br>
 the aorist passive subjunctive, transitive though passive. See<br>
 same construction in <!-#-->Lu 12:5. In <!-#-->Mt 10:28 the construction is<br>
 with \apo\ and the ablative, a translation Hebraism as in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 12:4 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar of the Greek N.T. in the Light of<br>
 Historical Research_, p. 577)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:28 <B>{Destroy both soul and body in hell}</B> <b><i>(\kai psuch&#275;n kai s&#333;ma<br>
 apolesai en geenn&#275;i\)</i></b>. Note "soul" here of the eternal spirit,<br>
 not just life in the body. "Destroy" here is not annihilation,<br>
 but eternal punishment in Gehenna <b><i>(the real hell)</i></b> for which see<br>
 on &#175;5:22. Bruce thinks that the devil as the tempter is here<br>
 meant, not God as the judge, but surely he is wrong. There is no<br>
 more needed lesson today than the fear of God.<br>
 <br>
 10:29 <B>{Two sparrows}</B> <b><i>(\duo strouthia\)</i></b>. Diminutive of \strouthos\<br>
 and means any small bird, sparrows in particular. They are sold<br>
 today in the markets of Jerusalem and Jaffa. "For a farthing"<br>
 <b><i>(\assariou\)</i></b> is genitive of price. Only here and <!-#-->Lu 12:6 in the<br>
 N.T. Diminutive form of the Roman _as_, slightly more than half<br>
 an English penny. <B>{Without your Father}</B> <b><i>(\aneu tou patros<br>
 h&#8211;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. There is comfort in this thought for us all. Our father<br>
 who knows about the sparrows knows and cares about us.<br>
 <br>
 10:31 <B>{Than many sparrows}</B> <b><i>(\poll&#333;n strouthi&#333;n\)</i></b>. Ablative case<br>
 of comparison with \diapherete\ <b><i>(our differ)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:32 <B>{Shall confess me}</B> <b><i>(\homolog&#275;sei en emoi\)</i></b>. An Aramaic<br>
 idiom, not Hebrew, see also <!-#-->Lu 12:8. So also here, "him will I<br>
 also confess" <b><i>(\homolog&#275;s&#333; k'ag&#333; en aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Literally this<br>
 Aramaic idiom reproduced in the Greek means "confess in me,"<br>
 indicating a sense of unity with Christ and of Christ with the<br>
 man who takes the open stand for him.<br>
 <br>
 10:33 <B>{Shall deny me}</B> <b><i>(\arn&#275;s&#275;tai me\)</i></b>. Aorist subjunctive here<br>
 with \hostis\, though future indicative \homolog&#275;sei\ above. Note<br>
 accusative here <b><i>(case of extension)</i></b>, saying "no" to Christ,<br>
 complete breach. This is a solemn law, not a mere social breach,<br>
 this cleavage by Christ of the man who repudiates him, public and<br>
 final.<br>
 <br>
 10:34 <B>{I came not to send peace, but a sword}</B> <b><i>(\ouk &#275;lthon balein<br>
 eir&#275;n&#275;n, alla machairan\)</i></b>. A bold and dramatic climax. The aorist<br>
 infinitive means a sudden hurling of the sword where peace was<br>
 expected. Christ does bring peace, not as the world gives, but it<br>
 is not the force of compromise with evil, but of conquest over<br>
 wrong, over Satan, the triumph of the cross. Meanwhile there will<br>
 be inevitably division in families, in communities, in states. It<br>
 is no namby-pamby sentimentalism that Christ preaches, no peace<br>
 at any price. The Cross is Christ's answer to the devil's offer<br>
 of compromise in world dominion. For Christ the kingdom of God is<br>
 virile righteousness, not mere emotionalism.<br>
 <br>
 10:35 <B>{Set at variance}</B> <b><i>(\dichasai\)</i></b>. Literally divide in two,<br>
 \dicha\. Jesus uses <!-#-->Mic 7:1-6 to describe the rottenness of the<br>
 age as Micah had done. Family ties and social ties cannot stand<br>
 in the way of loyalty to Christ and righteous living. <B>{The<br>
 daughter-in-law}</B> <b><i>(\numph&#275;n\)</i></b>. Literally bride, the young wife who<br>
 is possibly living with the mother-in-law. It is a tragedy to see<br>
 a father or mother step between the child and Christ.<br>
 <br>
 10:38 <B>{Doth not take his cross}</B> <b><i>(\ou lambanei ton stauron<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. The first mention of cross in Matthew. Criminals were<br>
 crucified in Jerusalem. It was the custom for the condemned<br>
 person to carry his own cross as Jesus did till Simon of Cyrene<br>
 was impressed for that purpose. The Jews had become familiar with<br>
 crucifixion since the days of Antiochus Epiphanes and one of the<br>
 Maccabean rulers <b><i>(Alexander Jannaeus)</i></b> had crucified 800<br>
 Pharisees. It is not certain whether Jesus was thinking of his<br>
 own coming crucifixion when he used this figure, though possible,<br>
 perhaps probable. The disciples would hardly think of that<br>
 outcome unless some of them had remarkable insight.<br>
 <br>
 10:39 <B>{Shall lose it}</B> <b><i>(\apolesei aut&#275;n\)</i></b>. This paradox appears in<br>
 four forms according to Allen <b><i>(I)</i></b> <!-#-->Mt 10:39 <b><i>(2)</i></b> <!-#-->Mr 8:35; Mt<br>
 16:25; Lu 9:24 <b><i>(3)</i></b> <!-#-->Lu 17:33 <b><i>(4)</i></b> <!-#-->Joh 12:25. _The Wisdom of<br>
 Sirach_ <b><i>(Hebrew text)</i></b> in 51:26 has: "He that giveth his life<br>
 findeth her <b><i>(wisdom)</i></b>." It is one of the profound sayings of<br>
 Christ that he repeated many times. Plato <b><i>(_Gorgias_ 512)</i></b> has<br>
 language somewhat similar though not so sharply put. The article<br>
 and aorist participles here <b><i>(\ho heur&#333;n, ho apolesas\)</i></b> are<br>
 timeless in themselves just like \ho dechomenos\ in verses <!-#-->40<br>
 and <!-#-->41.<br>
 <br>
 10:41 <B>{In the name of a prophet}</B> <b><i>(\eis onoma proph&#275;tou\)</i></b>.<br>
 "Because he is a prophet" <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>. In an Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 37<br>
 <b><i>(A.D. 49)</i></b> we find \onomati eleutherou\ in virtue of being<br>
 free-born. "He that receiveth a prophet from no ulterior motive,<br>
 but simply _qua_ prophet <b><i>(_ut prophetam_, Jer.)</i></b> would receive a<br>
 reward in the coming age equal to that of his guest" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 The use of \eis\ here is to be noted. In reality \eis\ is simply<br>
 \en\ with the same meaning. It is not proper to say that \eis\<br>
 has always to be translated "into." Besides these examples of<br>
 \eis onoma\ in verses <!-#-->41 and <!-#-->43 see <!-#-->Mt 12:41 \eis to<br>
 k&#275;rugma I&#333;n&#257;\ <b><i>(see Robertson's _Grammar_, p. 593)</i></b>. <B>{Unto one of<br>
 these little ones}</B> <b><i>(\hena t&#333;n mikr&#333;n tout&#333;n\)</i></b>. Simple believers<br>
 who are neither apostles, prophets, or particularly righteous,<br>
 just "learners," "in the name of a disciple" <b><i>(\eis onoma<br>
 math&#275;tou\)</i></b>. Alford thinks that some children were present <b><i>(cf.<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 18:2-6)</i></b>.<br>
