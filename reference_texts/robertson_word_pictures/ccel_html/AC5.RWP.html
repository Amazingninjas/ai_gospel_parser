<p>5:1 <B>{Sold}</B> <b><i>(\ep&#333;l&#275;sen\)</i></b>. Aorist active indicative again, for a<br>
 single case.<br>
 <br>
 5:2 <B>{Kept back}</B> <b><i>(\enosphisato\)</i></b>. First aorist middle indicative<br>
 of \nosphiz&#333;\, old verb from \nosphi\, afar, apart, and so to set<br>
 apart, to separate for oneself, but only here, verse <!-#-->3; Tit<br>
 2:10 in the N.T. <B>{His wife also being privy to it}</B> <b><i>(\suneidui&#275;s<br>
 kai t&#275;s gunaikos\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute with second perfect<br>
 participle of \sunoida\, to know together with one, "his wife<br>
 also knowing it together with him." <B>{Brought a certain part}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\enegkas meros ti\)</i></b>. Aorist active participle of \pher&#333;\, for a<br>
 definite act. The praise of Joseph was too much for Ananias, but<br>
 he was not willing to turn over all. He wanted praise for giving<br>
 all and yet he took care of himself by keeping some. Thus he<br>
 started the Ananias Club that gave a new meaning to his lovely<br>
 name <b><i>(God is gracious)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:3 <B>{Filled}</B> <b><i>(\epl&#275;r&#333;sen\)</i></b>. The very verb used of the filling by<br>
 the Holy Spirit <b><i>(<!-#-->4:31)</i></b>. Satan the adversary is the father of<br>
 lies <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 8:44)</i></b>. He had entered into Judas <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:3; Joh<br>
 13:27)</i></b> and now he has filled the heart of Ananias with a lie.<br>
 <B>{To lie to the Holy Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\pseusasthai se to pneuma to<br>
 hagion\)</i></b>. Infinitive <b><i>(aorist middle)</i></b> of purpose with accusative<br>
 of general reference <b><i>(\se\)</i></b> and the accusative of the person<br>
 <b><i>(object)</i></b> as often in Greek writers, though here only in the N.T.<br>
 with this verb. Usual dative of the person in verse <!-#-->4<br>
 <b><i>(\anthr&#333;pois\, men, \t&#333;i the&#333;i\, God)</i></b>. The Holy Spirit had been<br>
 given them to guide them into truth <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 15:13)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:4 <B>{Whiles it remained}</B> <b><i>(\menon\)</i></b>. Present active participle of<br>
 mend, unsold, Peter means. <B>{After it was sold}</B> <b><i>(\prathen\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive of \piprask&#333;\, to sell. <B>{How is that thou hast<br>
 conceived}</B> <b><i>(\Ti hoti ethou\)</i></b>. _Quid est quod_. See <!-#-->Lu 2:49. See<br>
 also <!-#-->Ac 5:9. Second aorist middle indicative second person<br>
 singular of \tith&#275;mi\. The devil filled his heart <b><i>(verse <!-#-->3)</i></b>,<br>
 but all the same Ananias did it too and is wholly responsible.<br>
 <br>
 5:5 <B>{Hearing}</B> <b><i>(\akou&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present active participle of \akou&#333;\,<br>
 while hearing. <B>{Fell down}</B> <b><i>(\pes&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \pipt&#333;\, fell all of a sudden while listening.<br>
 <B>{Gave up the ghost}</B> <b><i>(\exepsuxen\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative<br>
 of \ekpsuch&#333;\, late verb in LXX and Hippocrates, to breathe out,<br>
 to expire. In the N.T. only here, verse <!-#-->10; 12:23. It is<br>
 needless to blame Peter for the death of Ananias. He had brought<br>
 the end upon himself. It was the judgment of God. Physically the<br>
 nervous shock could have caused the collapse.<br>
 <br>
 5:6 <B>{The young men}</B> <b><i>(\hoi ne&#333;teroi\)</i></b>. Literally the younger men<br>
 <b><i>(contrast with \hoi presbuteroi\, the elder men)</i></b>. Same as<br>
 \neaniskoi\ in verse <!-#-->10 and so no order in the young church.<br>
 Perhaps these young men were acting as ushers or actual<br>
 pallbearers. <B>{Wrapped him round}</B> <b><i>(\sunesteilan\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active indicative of \sustell&#333;\, old verb, to draw together, or<br>
 contract <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 7:29)</i></b>, to roll together, to wrap with bandages,<br>
 to enshroud as here. Nowhere else in the N.T. Frequent in medical<br>
 writers. They may have used their own mantles. The time for<br>
 burial was short in Jerusalem for sanitary reasons and to avoid<br>
 ceremonial defilement.<br>
 <br>
 5:7 <B>{And it was about the space of three hours after}</B> <b><i>(\egeneto<br>
 de h&#333;s h&#333;r&#333;n tri&#333;n diast&#275;ma\)</i></b>. Literally "Now there came an<br>
 interval <b><i>(\diast&#275;ma\, distance, space between)</i></b> of about <b><i>(\h&#333;s\)</i></b><br>
 three hours." <B>{When}</B> <b><i>(\kai\)</i></b>. This use of \kai\ after \egeneto\<br>
 is characteristic of Luke's style in the Gospel. <B>{Not knowing}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275; eiduia\)</i></b>. Feminine singular of second perfect active<br>
 participle of \oida\. \M&#275;\ usual negative of the participle in<br>
 the _Koin&#275;_.<br>
 <br>
 5:8 <B>{For so much}</B> <b><i>(\tosoutou\)</i></b>. Genitive of price. Perhaps Peter<br>
 pointed to the pile of money at the feet of the apostles <b><i>(verse<br>
 <!-#-->2)</i></b>. The use of \ei\ in direct questions appears in Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 13:23; 22:49)</i></b> as in the LXX like the Hebrew _im_ and in <!-#-->Ac 1:6;<br>
 19:2, etc.<br>
 <br>
 5:9 <B>{Ye have agreed together}</B> <b><i>(\suneph&#333;n&#275;th&#275; humin\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive indicative of \sumph&#333;ne&#333;\ <b><i>(to voice together,<br>
 symphony)</i></b>, impersonal with dative; It was agreed together by you<br>
 <b><i>(or for you)</i></b>. "Your souls were allured together respecting this<br>
 deceit" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. <B>{To tempt the Spirit of the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\peirasai<br>
 to pneuma kuriou\)</i></b>. Like "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."<br>
 It was close to the unpardonable sin which was attributing the<br>
 manifest work of the Holy Spirit to Beelzebub. <B>{The feet}</B> <b><i>(\hoi<br>
 podes\)</i></b>. Graphic picture by Peter as he heard the steps of the<br>
 young men at the door.<br>
 <br>
 5:10 <B>{Immediately}</B> <b><i>(\parachr&#275;ma\)</i></b>. Hence her death was regarded<br>
 as supernatural like that of Ananias. <B>{By her husband}</B> <b><i>(\pros ton<br>
 andra aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Face to face to her husband.<br>
 <br>
 5:11 <B>{Upon the whole church}</B> <b><i>(\eph' hol&#275;n t&#275;n ekkl&#275;sian\)</i></b>. Here<br>
 \ekkl&#275;sia\ for the first time in Acts of the believers in<br>
 Jerusalem. Twice already in the Gospels, once of the whole body<br>
 of believers or the Kingdom <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 16:18)</i></b>, the other of the local<br>
 body <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 18:17)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Ac 7:38 it is used of the whole<br>
 congregation of Israel while in <!-#-->19:32 it is used of a public<br>
 assembly in Ephesus. But already in <!-#-->Ac 8:3 it is applied to the<br>
 church which Saul was persecuting in their homes when not<br>
 assembled. So here the etymological meaning of "assembly"<br>
 disappears for "the church" were now the scattered saints hiding<br>
 in their separate homes. The whole body of believers in Jerusalem<br>
 and all who heard of the fate of Ananias and Sapphira <b><i>(beautiful,<br>
 her name means)</i></b> were in awe and dread. It was already a dangerous<br>
 thing to be a follower of Christ unless one was willing to walk<br>
 straight.<br>
 <br>
 5:12 <B>{Were wrought}</B> <b><i>(\egineto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, wrought from<br>
 time to time. <B>{With one accord}</B> <b><i>(\homothumadon\)</i></b>. As already in<br>
 <!-#-->1:14; 2:46; 4:24 and later <!-#-->7:57; 8:6; 12:20; 15:25; 18:21;<br>
 19:29, old adverb and only in Acts in the N.T. Here "all" is<br>
 added. In Solomon's Porch again as in <!-#-->3:11 which see.<br>
 <br>
 5:13 <B>{Durst}</B> <b><i>(\etolma\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \tolma&#333;\, old verb,<br>
 not to fear or shun through fear, boldly to take a stand. The<br>
 fate of Ananias and Sapphira continued to hold many in check.<br>
 <B>{Join}</B> <b><i>(\kollasthai\)</i></b>. Present middle infinitive of \kolla&#333;\, old<br>
 verb to cleave to like glue as in <!-#-->Lu 15:15 which see. Seven<br>
 times in Acts <b><i>(<!-#-->9:26; 10:28; 17:34)</i></b>. The outsiders <b><i>(the rest)</i></b><br>
 preferred, many of them, to remain outside for the present,<br>
 especially the rulers. <B>{Howbeit the people}</B> <b><i>(\all'--ho laos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Probably individuals among the people, the populace as distinct<br>
 from the rulers and hostile outsiders.<br>
 <br>
 5:14 <B>{Were the more added}</B> <b><i>(\m&#257;llon prosetithento\)</i></b>. Rather<br>
 <b><i>(\m&#257;llon\)</i></b> instead of decrease as one might expect. Imperfect<br>
 passive indicative of \prostith&#275;mi\ common \mi\ verb, kept on<br>
 being added. <B>{Both of men and women}</B> <b><i>(\andr&#333;n te kai gunaik&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 The distinction between \andres\ and \gunaikes\ and to be<br>
 considered in connection with \andres\ in <!-#-->4:4 which see.<br>
 <br>
 5:15 <B>{Insomuch that}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste\)</i></b>. With the present infinitive<br>
 \ekpherein\ and \tithenai\, regular Greek idiom for result. <B>{Into<br>
 the streets}</B> <b><i>(\eis tas plateias\)</i></b>. Supply \hodous\ <b><i>(ways)</i></b>, into<br>
 the broad ways. <B>{On beds and couches}</B> <b><i>(\epi klinari&#333;n kai<br>
 krabatt&#333;n\)</i></b>. Little beds <b><i>(\klinaria\ diminutive of \klin&#275;\)</i></b> and<br>
 camp beds or pallets <b><i>(see on &#175;Mr 2:4,9,11)</i></b>. <B>{As Peter came by}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\erchomenou Petrou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute with present middle<br>
 participle. <B>{At the least his shadow might overshadow}</B> <b><i>(\kan h&#275;<br>
 skia episkiasei\)</i></b>. Future active indicative with \hina\ <b><i>(common<br>
 with \hop&#333;s\ in ancient Greek)</i></b> and \kan\ <b><i>(crasis for \kai<br>
 ean\=even if)</i></b>, even if only the shadow. The word for shadow<br>
 <b><i>(\skia\, like our "sky")</i></b> is repeated in the verb and preserved in<br>
 our "overshadow." There was, of course, no virtue or power in<br>
 Peter's shadow. That was faith with superstition, of course, just<br>
 as similar cases in the Gospels occur <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 9:20; Mr 6:56; Joh<br>
 9:5)</i></b> and the use of Paul's handkerchief <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 19:12)</i></b>. God<br>
 honours even superstitious faith if it is real faith in him. Few<br>
 people are wholly devoid of superstition.<br>
 <br>
 5:16 <B>{Came together}</B> <b><i>(\sun&#275;rcheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, kept on<br>
 coming. <B>{Round about}</B> <b><i>(\perix\)</i></b>. Old adverb, strengthened form of<br>
 \peri\, only here in the N.T. <B>{Vexed}</B> <b><i>(\ochloumenous\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 passive participle of \ochle&#333;\, to excite a mob <b><i>(\ochlos\)</i></b><br>
 against one, to trouble, annoy. Old word, only here in the N.T.,<br>
 though \enochle&#333;\ in <!-#-->Lu 6:18. <B>{Were healed every one}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\etherapeuonto hapantes\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive, were healed one at<br>
 a time, repetition.<br>
 <br>
 5:17 <B>{Which is the sect of the Sadducees}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; ousa hairesis t&#333;n<br>
 Saddoukai&#333;n\)</i></b>. Literally, "the existing sect of the Sadducees" or<br>
 "the sect which is of the Sadducees," \h&#275;\ being the article, not<br>
 the relative. \Hairesis\ means a choosing, from \haireomai\, to<br>
 take for oneself, to choose, then an opinion chosen or tenet<br>
 <b><i>(possibly <!-#-->2Pe 2:1)</i></b>, then parties or factions <b><i>(<!-#-->Gal 5:20; 1Co<br>
 11:19; possibly <!-#-->2Pe 2:1)</i></b>. It is applied here to the Sadducees;<br>
 to the Pharisees in <!-#-->Ac 15:5; 26:5; to the Christians in<br>
 <!-#-->24:5-14; 28:22. Already Luke has stated that the Sadducees<br>
 started the persecution of Peter and John <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 4:1f.)</i></b>. Now it is<br>
 extended to "the apostles" as a whole since Christianity has<br>
 spread more rapidly in Jerusalem than before it began.<br>
 <br>
 5:18 <B>{With jealousy}</B> <b><i>(\z&#275;lou\)</i></b>. Genitive case. Old word from ze&#333;,<br>
 to boil, our zeal. In itself it means only warmth, ardour, zeal,<br>
 but for a bad cause or from a bad motive, jealousy, envy, rivalry<br>
 results <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 13:45)</i></b>. Common in the epistles. <B>{In public ward}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\en t&#275;r&#275;sei d&#275;mosi&#257;i\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->4:3 only with \d&#275;mosi&#257;i\<br>
 <b><i>(public)</i></b> added, in the public prison, perhaps not the "common"<br>
 prison, but any prison is bad enough. In verse <!-#-->19 it is called<br>
 "the prison" <b><i>(\t&#275;s phulak&#275;s\)</i></b>, the guardhouse.<br>
 <br>
 5:20 <B>{And stand}</B> <b><i>(\kai stathentes\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 participle <b><i>(intransitive, ingressive aorist)</i></b>, take a stand. Bold<br>
 and pictorial command. <B>{All the words of this life}</B> <b><i>(\panta ta<br>
 rh&#275;mata t&#275;s z&#333;&#275;s taut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Not just a Hebraism for "all these<br>
 words of life." Probably "this life" which the Sadducees deny and<br>
 of which the angel is now speaking, this eternal life. <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 6:63,68; 1Co 15:19)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:21 <B>{About daybreak}</B> <b><i>(\hupo ton orthron\)</i></b>. From \ornumi\, to<br>
 stir up, to arouse, so the dawn <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:1; Joh 8:2)</i></b>. Old word,<br>
 but in the N.T. only these three passages. "Under the dawn" or<br>
 "about dawn." _Sub lucem_. The temple doors would be open for<br>
 early worshippers and traffickers <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 2:14)</i></b>. <B>{Taught}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\edidaskon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, began to teach. <B>{The council}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\to sunedrion\)</i></b>. The Sanhedrin. <B>{The senate}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n gerousian\)</i></b>.<br>
 From \ger&#333;n\, an old man, just as the Latin _senatus_ is from<br>
 _senex_, old. Like the \gerontes\ in Homer and the Elder<br>
 Statesmen in Japan. Apparently the senate of the people were also<br>
 part of the Sanhedrin and the use of "and" <b><i>(\kai\)</i></b> is explanatory<br>
 and adds this item in particular. Page thinks that this group of<br>
 elders were not members of the Sanhedrin at all. <B>{To the prison<br>
 house}</B> <b><i>(\eis to desm&#333;t&#275;rion\)</i></b>, another word for prison <b><i>(\t&#275;r&#275;sis<br>
 d&#275;mosia\ in verse <!-#-->18, \h&#275; phulak&#275;\ in verse <!-#-->19)</i></b>. See also<br>
 verses <!-#-->22,23,25. This from \desmos\, bond, and \t&#275;re&#333;\, to<br>
 keep, place where bound men are kept.<br>
 <br>
 5:22 <B>{The officers}</B> <b><i>(\hoi hup&#275;retai\)</i></b>. Under-rowers, literally<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:25)</i></b>. The servants or officers who executed the orders of<br>
 the Sanhedrin. <B>{Shut}</B> <b><i>(\kekleismenon\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle of \klei&#333;\. Shut tight. <B>{Standing at the doors}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hest&#333;tas epi t&#333;n thur&#333;n\)</i></b>. Graphic picture of the sentinels at<br>
 the prison doors.<br>
 <br>
 5:24 <B>{They were much perplexed}</B> <b><i>(\di&#275;poroun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active<br>
 of \diapore&#333;\ old verb by Luke only in the N.T. See already on<br>
 <!-#-->Ac 2:12. They continued puzzled. <B>{Whereunto this would grow}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ti an genoito touto\)</i></b>. More exactly, <B>{As to what this would<br>
 become}</B>. Second aorist middle optative of \ginomai\ with \an\,<br>
 the conclusion of a condition of the fourth class <b><i>(undetermined<br>
 with less likelihood of determination)</i></b>, the unexpressed condition<br>
 being "if the thing should be allowed to go on." The indirect<br>
 question simply retains the optative with \an\ <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, pp. 1021, 1044)</i></b>. If they had only known how this grain<br>
 of mustard seed would grow into the greatest tree on earth and<br>
 how dwarfed the tree of Judaism would be beside it!<br>
 <br>
 5:26 <B>{Brought}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;gen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \ag&#333;\, was bringing<br>
 <b><i>(leading)</i></b>, slowly no doubt, and solemnly. <B>{But without violence}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ou meta bias\)</i></b>. Literally, not with violence. <B>{For they feared}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ephobounto gar\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, still feared, kept on<br>
 fearing. <B>{Lest they be stoned}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; lithasth&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Negative<br>
 purpose with \m&#275;\ <b><i>(like \hina m&#275;\)</i></b>, probably with "not with<br>
 violence," though possible with "they feared." They handled the<br>
 apostles gently for fear of being stoned themselves by the<br>
 people. First aorist passive subjunctive of \lithaz&#333;\ <b><i>(from<br>
 \lithos\, stone)</i></b>, old verb to pelt with stones <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 14:19; Joh<br>
 10:31-33)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:27 <B>{They set them}</B> <b><i>(\est&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative<br>
 <b><i>(transitive)</i></b> of \hist&#275;mi\.<br>
 <br>
 5:28 <B>{We straitly charged}</B> <b><i>(\Paraggeli&#257;i par&#275;ggeilamen\)</i></b>. Like<br>
 the Hebrew idiom <b><i>(common in the LXX)</i></b>, though found in Greek, with<br>
 charging <b><i>(instrumental case)</i></b> we charged <b><i>(cf. same idiom in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 22:15)</i></b>. Somewhat like the cognate accusative. The command<br>
 referred to occurs in <!-#-->Ac 4:17,18 and the refusal of Peter and<br>
 John in <!-#-->4:20. <B>{To bring upon us}</B> <b><i>(\epagagein eph' h&#275;m&#257;s\)</i></b>. Note<br>
 repetition of \epi\. Second aorist active infinitive of \epag&#333;\,<br>
 old verb, but in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->2Pe 2:1,5. The<br>
 Sanhedrin gladly took the blood of Christ on their heads and<br>
 their children to Pilate <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:25)</i></b>. Paul tried to save the<br>
 Jews <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:6; 22:20)</i></b>. "<B>{This man}</B>" <b><i>(\tou anthr&#333;pou toutou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Contemptuous slur and refusal to call the name of Jesus as in the<br>
 Talmud later.<br>
 <br>
 5:29 <B>{We must}</B> <b><i>(\dei\)</i></b>. Moral necessity left them no choice. They<br>
 stood precisely where Peter and John were when before the<br>
 Sanhedrin before <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 4:20)</i></b>. <B>{Obey}</B> <b><i>(\peitharchein\)</i></b>. Old verb<br>
 from \peithomai\ and \arch&#275;\, to obey a ruler. Only by Luke and<br>
 Paul in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 5:30 <B>{Ye slew}</B> <b><i>(\diecheirisasthe\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 indicative of \diacheirizomai\, old verb from \dia\ and \cheir\<br>
 <b><i>(hand)</i></b>, to take in hand, manage, to lay hands on, manhandle,<br>
 kill. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ac 26:21. <B>{Hanging him upon a<br>
 tree}</B> <b><i>(\kremasantes epi xulou\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle<br>
 of \kremannumi\ <b><i>(\kremannu&#333;\ seen already in <!-#-->Mt 18:6 and <!-#-->Lu<br>
 23:39)</i></b>. Peter refers to <!-#-->De 21:23 as Paul does in <!-#-->Ga 3:13,<br>
 the curse pronounced on every one who "hangs upon a tree."<br>
 <br>
 5:31 <B>{Exalt}</B> <b><i>(\ups&#333;sen\)</i></b> In contrast to their murder of Christ as<br>
 in <!-#-->2:23f. Peter repeats his charges with increased boldness.<br>
 <B>{With his right hand}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i dexi&#257;i autou\)</i></b>. So instrumental case,<br>
 or at his right hand <b><i>(locative case)</i></b>, or even "to his right hand"<br>
 <b><i>(dative case)</i></b> as in <!-#-->2:33. <B>{Prince and Saviour}</B> <b><i>(\arch&#275;gon kai<br>
 s&#333;t&#275;ra\)</i></b>. See on &#175;3:15. Clearly "Prince" here. <B>{To give}</B> <b><i>(\tou<br>
 dounai\)</i></b>. Genitive of articular infinitive <b><i>(second aorist active<br>
 of \did&#333;mi\)</i></b> of purpose.<br>
 <br>
 5:32 <B>{We are witnesses}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meis esmen martures\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->2:32.<br>
 <B>{Things}</B> <b><i>(\rh&#275;mat&#333;n\)</i></b>. Literally, sayings, but like the Hebrew<br>
 _dabhar_ for "word" it is here used for "things." <B>{And so is the<br>
 Holy Ghost}</B> <b><i>(\kai to pneuma to hagion\)</i></b>. The word for "is"<br>
 <b><i>(\estin\)</i></b> is not in the Greek, but this is plainly the meaning.<br>
 Peter claims the witness of the Holy Spirit to the raising of<br>
 Jesus Christ, God's Son, by the Father.<br>
 <br>
 5:33 <B>{Were cut to the heart}</B> <b><i>(\dieprionto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive of<br>
 \diapri&#333;\ old verb <b><i>(\dia, pri&#333;\)</i></b>, to saw in two <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b>, to cut<br>
 in two <b><i>(to the heart)</i></b>. Here it is rage that cuts into their<br>
 hearts, not conviction of sin as in <!-#-->Ac 2:37. Only here and <!-#-->Ac<br>
 7:54 <b><i>(after Stephen's speech)</i></b> in the N.T. <b><i>(cf. Simeon's prophecy<br>
 in <!-#-->Lu 2:35)</i></b>. <B>{Were minded}</B> <b><i>(\eboulonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of<br>
 \boulomai\. They were plotting and planning to kill <b><i>(\anelein\,<br>
 as in <!-#-->Ac 2:23; Lu 23:33 which see)</i></b> then and there. The point in<br>
 <!-#-->4:7 was whether the apostles deserved stoning for curing the<br>
 cripple by demoniacal power, but here it was disobedience to the<br>
 command of the Sanhedrin which was not a capital offence. "They<br>
 were on the point of committing a grave judicial blunder"<br>
 <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:34 <B>{Gamaliel}</B> <b><i>(\Gamali&#275;l\)</i></b>. The grandson of Hillel, teacher of<br>
 Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 22:3)</i></b>, later president of the Sanhedrin, and the first<br>
 of the seven rabbis termed "Rabban." It is held by some that he<br>
 was one of the doctors who heard the Boy Jesus in the temple <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 2:47)</i></b> and that he was a secret disciple like Joseph of Arimathea<br>
 and Nicodemus, but there is no evidence of either position.<br>
 Besides, he appears here as a loyal Pharisee and "a doctor of the<br>
 law" <b><i>(\nomodidaskalos\)</i></b>. This word appears already in <!-#-->Lu 5:17<br>
 of the Pharisaic doctors bent on criticizing Jesus, which see.<br>
 Paul uses it of Judaizing Christians <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 1:7)</i></b>. Like other<br>
 great rabbis he had a great saying: "Procure thyself a teacher,<br>
 avoid being in doubt; and do not accustom thyself to give tithes<br>
 by guess." He was a man of judicial temper and not prone to go<br>
 off at a tangent, though his brilliant young pupil Saul went to<br>
 the limit about Stephen without any restraint on the part of<br>
 Gamaliel so far as the record goes. Gamaliel champions the cause<br>
 of the apostles as a Pharisee to score a point against the<br>
 Sadducees. He acts as a theological opportunist, not as a<br>
 disciple of Christ. He felt that a temporizing policy was best.<br>
 There are difficulties in this speech of Gamaliel and it is not<br>
 clear how Luke obtained the data for the address. It is, of<br>
 course, possible that Saul was present and made notes of it for<br>
 Luke afterwards. <B>{Had in honour of all the people}</B> <b><i>(\timios panti<br>
 t&#333;i la&#333;i\)</i></b>. Ethical dative. \Timios\ from \tim&#275;\, old word<br>
 meaning precious, dear. <B>{The men}</B> <b><i>(\tous anthr&#333;pous\)</i></b>. Correct<br>
 text as in verse <!-#-->35, not "the apostles" as Textus Receptus.<br>
 <br>
 5:35 <B>{Take heed}</B> <b><i>(\prosechete heautois\)</i></b>. Hold your mind <b><i>(\noun\,<br>
 unexpressed)</i></b> for or on yourselves <b><i>(dative case)</i></b>, the usual idiom.<br>
 <br>
 5:36 <B>{Theudas}</B> <b><i>(\Theudas\)</i></b>. Luke represents Gamaliel here about<br>
 A.D. 35 as speaking of a man who led a revolt before that of<br>
 Judas the Galilean in connection with the enrolment under<br>
 Quirinius <b><i>(Cyrenius)</i></b> in A.D. 6. But Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. XX. 5, 1)</i></b><br>
 tells of a Theudas who led a similar insurrection in the reign of<br>
 Claudius about A.D. 44 or 45. Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. XVIII. 1, 6; XX.<br>
 5, 2; _War_ ii. 8, 1 and 17, 8)</i></b> also describes Judas the Galilean<br>
 or Gaulonite and places him about A.D. 6. It is not certain that<br>
 Josephus and Luke <b><i>(Gamaliel)</i></b> refer to the same Theudas as the<br>
 name is an abbreviation of Theodosus, a common name. "Josephus<br>
 gives an account of four men named Simon who followed each other<br>
 within forty years, and of three named Judas within ten years,<br>
 who were all instigators of rebellion" <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>. If the same<br>
 Theudas is meant, then either Josephus or Luke <b><i>(Gamaliel)</i></b> has the<br>
 wrong historical order. In that case one will credit Luke or<br>
 Josephus according to his estimate of the two as reliable<br>
 historians. <B>{To be somebody}</B> <b><i>(\einai tina\)</i></b>. Indirect assertion<br>
 with the infinitive and the accusative of general reference<br>
 <b><i>(\heauton\)</i></b> and \tina\, predicate accusative. \Tina\ could be<br>
 "anybody" or "somebody" according to context, clearly "somebody"<br>
 of importance here. <B>{Joined themselves}</B> <b><i>(\proseklith&#275;\)</i></b>. Correct<br>
 text and not \prosekoll&#275;th&#275;\ <b><i>(Textus Receptus)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive indicative of \prosklin&#333;\, old verb to lean towards, to<br>
 incline towards. Here only in the N.T. <B>{Was slain}</B> <b><i>(\an&#275;ireth&#275;\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive of \anaire&#333;\ <b><i>(cf. verse <!-#-->33)</i></b>. <B>{Obeyed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epeithonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, kept on obeying. <B>{Were<br>
 dispersed}</B> <b><i>(\dieluth&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative<br>
 <b><i>(effective aorist)</i></b> of \dialu&#333;\, old verb to dissolve, to go to<br>
 pieces. Here only in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 5:37 <B>{Of the enrolment}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;s apograph&#275;s\)</i></b>. Described by Josephus<br>
 <b><i>(_Ant_. XV. 1, 1)</i></b>. The same word used by Luke of the first<br>
 enrolment started by Augustus B.C. 8 to 6 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:2)</i></b>. See the<br>
 discussion on &#175;Lu 2:2. This is the second enrolment in the<br>
 fourteen year cycle carried on for centuries as shown by numerous<br>
 dated papyri. Ramsay <b><i>(_The Bearing of Recent Discovery on the<br>
 Trustworthiness of the N.T._)</i></b> has produced proof from<br>
 inscriptions that Quirinius was twice in Syria as Luke reports<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Luke the Historian in the Light of Research_)</i></b>. <B>{Drew<br>
 away}</B> <b><i>(\apest&#275;se\)</i></b>. Causative sense of the first aorist active<br>
 indicative of \aphist&#275;mi\, made people <b><i>(\laon\, no need of "some<br>
 of the")</i></b> to revolt <b><i>(apostatize)</i></b> with him. <B>{He also}</B> <b><i>(\kakeinos\,<br>
 crasis for \kai ekeinos\)</i></b>. That one, also. <B>{Were scattered<br>
 abroad}</B> <b><i>(\dieskorpisth&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b> passive<br>
 indicative of \diaskorpiz&#333;\, old verb to disperse. Used of sheep<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:27)</i></b>, of property <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 15:13)</i></b>. Aorist here after<br>
 imperfect <b><i>(\epeithonto\)</i></b> as in verse <!-#-->36.<br>
 <br>
 5:38 <B>{Refrain from}</B> <b><i>(\apost&#275;te apo\)</i></b>. Second aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b><br>
 active imperative of \aphist&#275;mi\ of verse <!-#-->37. Do ye stand off<br>
 from these men. "Hands off" was the policy of Gamaliel. <B>{For<br>
 if--be}</B> <b><i>(\hoti ean--&#275;i\)</i></b>. \Hoti\ gives the reason for the advice.<br>
 Gamaliel presents two alternatives in terms of two conditional<br>
 clauses. The first one is stated as a condition of the third<br>
 class, \ean\ with the present subjunctive \&#275;i\, undetermined with<br>
 prospect of determination. Assuming that it is from men, "it will<br>
 be overthrown" <b><i>(\kataluth&#275;setai\, first future passive of<br>
 \katalu&#333;\, to loosen down like a falling house)</i></b> as was true of<br>
 the following of Theudas and Judas the Galilean.<br>
 <br>
 5:39 <B>{But if it is of God}</B> <b><i>(\ei de ek theou estin\)</i></b>. The second<br>
 alternative is a condition of the first class, determined as<br>
 fulfilled, \ei\ with the present indicative. By the use of this<br>
 idiom Gamaliel does put the case more strongly in favor of the<br>
 apostles than against them. This condition _assumes_ that the<br>
 thing is so without _affirming_ it to be true. On the basis of<br>
 this alternative Gamaliel warns the Sanhedrin that they cannot<br>
 "overthrow" <b><i>(\katalusai\)</i></b> these men for they in that case must<br>
 "overthrow" God, <B>{lest haply ye be found}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; pote--hureth&#275;te\,<br>
 negative purpose with first aorist passive subjunctive)</i></b> <B>{even to<br>
 be fighting against God}</B> <b><i>(\kai theomachoi\, late adjective from<br>
 \theos\ and \machomai\, in LXX and here only in the N.T.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 5:40 <B>{To him they agreed}</B> <b><i>(\epeisth&#275;san aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive indicative of \peith&#333;\, to persuade, the passive to be<br>
 persuaded by, to listen to, to obey. Gamaliel's shrewd advice<br>
 scored as against the Sadducaic contention <b><i>(verse <!-#-->17)</i></b>. <B>{Not to<br>
 speak}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; lalein\)</i></b>. The Sanhedrin repeated the prohibition of<br>
 <!-#-->4:18 which the apostles had steadily refused to obey. The<br>
 Sanhedrin stood by their guns, but refused to shoot. It was a<br>
 "draw" with Gamaliel as tactical victor over the Sadducees.<br>
 Clearly now the disciples were set free because only the<br>
 Sadducees had become enraged while the Pharisees held aloof.<br>
 <br>
 5:41 <B>{They therefore}</B> <b><i>(\hoi men oun\)</i></b>. No answering \de\. <B>{They<br>
 were counted worthy to suffer dishonour for the Name}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kat&#275;xi&#333;th&#275;san huper tou onomatos atimasth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive indicative of \kataxio&#333;\, old verb to count worthy. Three<br>
 times in N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 20:35; Ac 5:41; 2Th 1:5)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive infinitive of \atimaz&#333;\, old verb to make one dishonoured<br>
 <b><i>(\atimos\)</i></b>. Forms here an oxymoron <b><i>(\oxus\, sharp, \moros\,<br>
 foolish)</i></b> pointedly foolish saying "which is witty or impressive<br>
 through sheer contradiction or paradox as laborious idleness,<br>
 sublime indifference" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. The apostles felt honoured by<br>
 dishonour. Note the same use of "the Name" as in <!-#-->Jas 2:7; 3Jo<br>
 1:7. With the Jews this absolute use of "the Name" meant<br>
 Jehovah. The Christians now apply it to Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 5:42 <B>{Every day}</B> <b><i>(\p&#257;san h&#275;meran\)</i></b>. Accusative of extent of time,<br>
 all through every day. <B>{In the temple and at home}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i<br>
 hier&#333;i kai kat' oikon\)</i></b>. This was a distinct triumph to go back<br>
 to the temple where they had been arrested <b><i>(verse <!-#-->25)</i></b> and at<br>
 home or from house to house, as it probably means <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->2:46)</i></b>.<br>
 It was a great day for the disciples in Jerusalem. <B>{They ceased<br>
 not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk epauonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle. They kept it up. <B>{Jesus<br>
 as the Christ}</B> <b><i>(\ton Christon I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. Jesus is the direct<br>
 object of the participles \didaskontes\ <b><i>(teaching)</i></b> and<br>
 \euaggelizomenoi\ <b><i>(preaching or evangelizing)</i></b> while "the Christ"<br>
 <b><i>(\ton Christon\)</i></b> is the predicate accusative. These words give<br>
 the substance of the early apostolic preaching as these opening<br>
 chapters of Acts show, that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah of<br>
 promise. Gamaliel had opened the prison doors for them and they<br>
 took full advantage of the opportunity that now was theirs.<br>
