<p>19:1 <B>{While Apollos was at Corinth}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i ton Apoll&#333; einai en<br>
 Korinth&#333;i\)</i></b>. Favourite idiom with Luke, \en\ with the locative of<br>
 the articular infinitive and the accusative of general reference<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:8; 2:27, etc.)</i></b>. <B>{Having passed through the upper country}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dielthonta ta an&#333;terika mer&#275;\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle<br>
 of \dierchomai\, accusative case agreeing with \Paulon\,<br>
 accusative of general reference with the infinitive \elthein\,<br>
 idiomatic construction with \egeneto\. The word for "upper"<br>
 <b><i>(\an&#333;terika\)</i></b> is a late form for \an&#333;tera\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 14:10)</i></b> and<br>
 occurs in Hippocrates and Galen. It refers to the highlands <b><i>(cf.<br>
 Xenophon's _Anabasis_)</i></b> and means that Paul did not travel the<br>
 usual Roman road west by Colossae and Laodicea in the Lycus<br>
 Valley, cities that he did not visit <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 2:1)</i></b>. Instead he took<br>
 the more direct road through the Cayster Valley to Ephesus. Codex<br>
 Bezae says here that Paul wanted to go back to Jerusalem, but<br>
 that the Holy Spirit bade him to go into Asia where he had been<br>
 forbidden to go in the second tour <b><i>(<!-#-->16:6)</i></b>. Whether the upper<br>
 "parts" <b><i>(\mer&#275;\)</i></b> here points to North Galatia is still a point of<br>
 dispute among scholars. So he came again to Ephesus as he had<br>
 promised to do <b><i>(<!-#-->18:21)</i></b>. The province of Asia included the<br>
 western part of Asia Minor. The Romans took this country B.C.<br>
 130. Finally the name was extended to the whole continent. It was<br>
 a jewel in the Roman empire along with Africa and was a<br>
 senatorial province. It was full of great cities like Ephesus,<br>
 Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea <b><i>(the<br>
 seven churches of <!-#-->Re 2;3)</i></b>, Colossae, Hierapolis, Apamea, to go<br>
 no further. Hellenism had full sway here. Ephesus was the capital<br>
 and chief city and was a richer and larger city than Corinth. It<br>
 was located at the entrance to the valley of the Maeander to the<br>
 east. Here was the power of Rome and the splendour of Greek<br>
 culture and the full tide of oriental superstition and magic. The<br>
 Temple of Artemis was one of the seven wonders of the world.<br>
 While in Ephesus some hold that Paul at this time wrote the<br>
 Epistle to the Galatians after his recent visit there, some that<br>
 he did it before his recent visit to Jerusalem. But it is still<br>
 possible that he wrote it from Corinth just before writing to<br>
 Rome, a point to discuss later. <B>{Certain disciples}</B> <b><i>(\tinas<br>
 math&#275;tas\)</i></b>. Who were they? Apollos had already gone to Corinth.<br>
 They show no connection with Priscilla and Aquila. Luke calls<br>
 them "disciples" or "learners" <b><i>(\math&#275;tas\)</i></b> because they were<br>
 evidently sincere though crude and ignorant. There is no reason<br>
 at all for connecting these uninformed disciples of the Baptist<br>
 with Apollos. They were floating followers of the Baptist who<br>
 drifted into Ephesus and whom Paul found. Some of John's<br>
 disciples clung to him till his death <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 3:22-25; Lu 7:19; Mt<br>
 14:12)</i></b>. Some of them left Palestine without the further<br>
 knowledge of Jesus that came after his death and some did not<br>
 even know that, as turned out to be the case with the group in<br>
 Ephesus.<br>
 <br>
 19:2 <B>{Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed?}</B> <b><i>(\ei<br>
 pneuma hagion elabete pisteusantes?\)</i></b>. This use of \Pi\ in a<br>
 direct question occurs in <!-#-->1:6, is not according to the old<br>
 Greek idiom, but is common in the LXX and the N.T. as in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 13:23 which see <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 916)</i></b>. Apparently Paul<br>
 was suspicious of the looks or conduct of these professed<br>
 disciples. The first aorist active participle \pisteusantes\ is<br>
 simultaneous with the second aorist active indicative \elabete\<br>
 and refers to the same event. <B>{Nay, we did not so much as hear<br>
 whether the Holy Spirit was}</B> <b><i>(\All' oude ei pneuma hagion estin<br>
 &#275;kousamen\)</i></b>. The reply of these ignorant disciples is amazing.<br>
 They probably refer to the time of their baptism and mean that,<br>
 when baptized, they did not hear whether <b><i>(\ei\ in indirect<br>
 question)</i></b> the Holy Spirit was <b><i>(\estin\ retained as in <!-#-->Joh<br>
 7:39)</i></b>. Plain proof that they knew John's message poorly.<br>
 <br>
 19:3 <B>{Into what}</B> <b><i>(\eis ti\)</i></b>. More properly, <B>{Unto what}</B> or <B>{on<br>
 what basis}</B> <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 592)</i></b>. Clearly, Paul felt<br>
 they had received a poor baptism with no knowledge of the Holy<br>
 Spirit. <B>{John's baptism}</B> <b><i>(\to I&#333;anou baptisma\)</i></b>. Last mention of<br>
 John the Baptist in the N.T. They had been dipped in other words,<br>
 but they had not grasped the significance of the ordinance.<br>
 <br>
 19:4 <B>{With the baptism of repentance}</B> <b><i>(\baptisma metanoias\)</i></b>.<br>
 Cognate accusative with \ebaptisen\ and the genitive \metanoias\<br>
 describing the baptism as marked by <b><i>(case of species or genus)</i></b>,<br>
 not as conveying, repentance just as in <!-#-->Mr 1:4 and that was the<br>
 work of the Holy Spirit. But John preached also the baptism of<br>
 the Holy Spirit which the Messiah was to bring <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:7f.; Mt<br>
 3:11f.; Lu 3:16)</i></b>. If they did not know of the Holy Spirit, they<br>
 had missed the point of John's baptism. <B>{That they should believe<br>
 on him that should come after him, that is on Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\eis ton<br>
 erchomenon met' auton hina pisteus&#333;sin, tout' estin eis ton<br>
 I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. Note the emphatic prolepsis of \eis ton erchomenon met'<br>
 auton\ before \hina pisteus&#333;sin\ with which it is construed. This<br>
 is John's identical phrase, "the one coming after me" as seen in<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 1:7; Mt 3:11; Lu 3:16; Joh 1:15. It is not clear that these<br>
 "disciples" believed in a Messiah, least of all in Jesus. They<br>
 were wholly unprepared for the baptism of John. Paul does not<br>
 mean to say that John's baptism was inadequate, but he simply<br>
 explains what John really taught and so what his baptism<br>
 signified.<br>
 <br>
 19:5 <B>{The name of the Lord Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\to onoma ton kuriou I&#275;sou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Apollos was not rebaptized. The twelve apostles were not<br>
 rebaptized. Jesus received no other baptism than that of John.<br>
 The point here is simply that these twelve men were grossly<br>
 ignorant of the meaning of John's baptism as regards repentance,<br>
 the Messiahship of Jesus, the Holy Spirit. Hence Paul had them<br>
 baptized, not so much again, as really baptized this time, in the<br>
 name or on the authority of the Lord Jesus as he had himself<br>
 commanded <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 28:19)</i></b> and as was the universal apostolic custom.<br>
 Proper understanding of "Jesus" involved all the rest including<br>
 the Trinity <b><i>(Father, Son, and Holy Spirit)</i></b>. Luke does not give a<br>
 formula, but simply explains that now these men had a proper<br>
 object of faith <b><i>(Jesus)</i></b> and were now really baptized.<br>
 <br>
 19:6 <B>{When Paul had laid his hands upon them}</B> <b><i>(\epithentos autois<br>
 tou Paulou cheiras\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute of second aorist active<br>
 participle of \epitith&#275;mi\. This act of laying on of the hands<br>
 was done in Samaria by Peter and John <b><i>(<!-#-->8:16)</i></b> and in Damascus in<br>
 the case of Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->9:17)</i></b> and was followed as here by the descent<br>
 of the Holy Spirit in supernatural power. <B>{They spake with<br>
 tongues}</B> <b><i>(\elaloun gl&#333;ssais\)</i></b>. Inchoative imperfect, began to<br>
 speak with tongues as in Jerusalem at Pentecost and as in<br>
 Caesarea before the baptism. <B>{Prophesied}</B> <b><i>(\eproph&#275;teuon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Inchoative imperfect again, began to prophesy. The speaking with<br>
 tongues and prophesying was external and indubitable proof that<br>
 the Holy Spirit had come on these twelve uninformed disciples now<br>
 fully won to the service of Jesus as Messiah. But this baptism in<br>
 water did not "convey" the Holy Spirit nor forgiveness of sins.<br>
 Paul was not a sacramentalist.<br>
 <br>
 19:8 <B>{Spake boldly}</B> <b><i>(\eparr&#275;siazeto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, kept on<br>
 at it for three months. Cf. same word in <!-#-->18:26. <B>{Persuading}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\peith&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present active conative participle of \peith&#333;\,<br>
 trying to persuade <b><i>(<!-#-->28:23)</i></b>. Paul's idea of the Kingdom of God<br>
 was the church of God which he <b><i>(Jesus, God's Son)</i></b> had purchased<br>
 with his own blood <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:28, calling Christ God)</i></b>. Nowhere else<br>
 had Paul apparently been able to speak so long in the synagogue<br>
 without interruption unless it was so at Corinth. These Jews were<br>
 already interested <b><i>(<!-#-->18:30)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 19:9 <B>{But when some were hardened}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s de tines eskl&#275;runonto\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect passive of \skl&#275;run&#333;\, causative like _hiphil_ in<br>
 Hebrew, to make hard <b><i>(\skl&#275;ros\)</i></b> or rough or harsh <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 25:24)</i></b>.<br>
 In LXX and Hippocrates and Galen <b><i>(in medical writings)</i></b>. In N.T.<br>
 only here and <!-#-->Ro 9:18 and 4 times in <!-#-->Heb 3:8,13,15; 4:7,8<br>
 quoting and referring to <!-#-->Ps 95:8 about hardening the heart like<br>
 a gristle. The inevitable reaction against Paul went on even in<br>
 Ephesus though slowly. <B>{Disobedient}</B> <b><i>(\epeithoun\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 again, showing the growing disbelief and disobedience<br>
 <b><i>(\apeith&#275;s\)</i></b>, both ideas as in <!-#-->14:2; 17:5, first refusal to<br>
 believe and then refusal to obey. Both \skl&#275;run&#333;\ and \apeithe&#333;\<br>
 occur together, as here, in Ecclus. 30:12. <B>{Speaking evil of the<br>
 Way}</B> <b><i>(\kakologountes t&#275;n hodon\)</i></b>. Late verb from \kakologos\<br>
 <b><i>(speaker of evil)</i></b> for the old \kak&#333;s leg&#333;\. Already in <!-#-->Mr 7:10;<br>
 9:39; Mt 15:4. Now these Jews are aggressive opponents of Paul<br>
 and seek to injure his influence with the crowd. Note "the Way"<br>
 as in <!-#-->9:2 for Christianity. <B>{He departed from them}</B> <b><i>(\apostas<br>
 ap' aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of \aphist&#275;mi\, made<br>
 an "apostasy" <b><i>(standing off, cleavage)</i></b> as he did at Corinth<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->18:7, \metabas\, making a change)</i></b>. <B>{Separated the disciples}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aph&#333;risen tous math&#275;tas\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of<br>
 \aphoriz&#333;\, old verb to mark limits <b><i>(horizon)</i></b> as already in<br>
 <!-#-->13:2. Paul himself was a spiritual Pharisee "separated" to<br>
 Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:1)</i></b>. The Jews regarded this withdrawal as apostasy,<br>
 like separating the sheep from the goats <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 25:32)</i></b>. Paul now<br>
 made a separate church as he had done at Thessalonica and<br>
 Corinth. <B>{In the school of Tyrannus}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i schol&#275;i Turannou\)</i></b>.<br>
 \Schol&#275;\ <b><i>(our school)</i></b> is an old word from \schein\ <b><i>(\ech&#333;\)</i></b> to<br>
 hold on, leisure and then in later Greek <b><i>(Plutarch, etc.)</i></b> a place<br>
 where there is leisure as here. Only this example in the N.T.<br>
 This is the Greek notion of "school," the Jewish being that of<br>
 "yoke" as in <!-#-->Mt 11:29. The name Tyrannus <b><i>(our tyrant)</i></b> is a<br>
 common one. It is an inscription in the Columbarium of the<br>
 Empress Livia as that of a physician in the court. Furneaux<br>
 suggests the possibility that a relative of this physician was<br>
 lecturing on medicine in Ephesus and so as a friend of Luke, the<br>
 physician, would be glad to help Paul about a place to preach. It<br>
 was probably a public building or lecture hall with this name<br>
 whether hired by Paul or loaned to him. The pagan sophists often<br>
 spoke in such halls. The Codex Bezae adds "from the fifth hour to<br>
 the tenth" as the time allotted Paul for his work in this hall,<br>
 which is quite possible, from just before midday till the close<br>
 of the afternoon <b><i>(from before the noon meal till two hours before<br>
 sunset)</i></b> each day. Here Paul had great freedom and a great<br>
 hearing. As the church grows there will be other places of<br>
 meeting as the church in the house of Aquila and Priscilla <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 16:19)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 19:10 <B>{For two years}</B> <b><i>(\epi et&#275; duo\)</i></b>. Note \epi\ with accusative<br>
 for extent of time as in verse <!-#-->8, \epi m&#275;nas treis\ and often.<br>
 But in <!-#-->20:31 Paul said to the Ephesian elders at Miletus that<br>
 he laboured with them for the space of "three years." That may be<br>
 a general expression and there was probably a longer period after<br>
 the "two years" in the school of Tyrannus besides the six months<br>
 in the synagogue. Paul may have preached thereafter in the house<br>
 of Aquila and Priscilla for some months, the "for a while" of<br>
 verse <!-#-->22. <B>{So that all they which dwelt in Asia heard}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste<br>
 pantas tous katoikountas t&#275;n Asian akousai\)</i></b>. Actual result with<br>
 \h&#333;ste\ and the infinitive with accusative of general reference<br>
 as is common <b><i>(also verse <!-#-->11)</i></b> in the _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, pp. 999f.)</i></b>. Paul apparently remained in Ephesus, but<br>
 the gospel spread all over the province even to the Lycus Valley<br>
 including the rest of the seven churches of <!-#-->Re 1:11; 2; 3.<br>
 Demetrius in verse <!-#-->26 will confirm the tremendous influence of<br>
 Paul's ministry in Ephesus on Asia. Forty years after this Pliny<br>
 in his famous letter to Trajan from Bithynia will say of<br>
 Christianity: "For the contagion of this superstition has not<br>
 only spread through cities, but also through villages and country<br>
 places." It was during these years in Ephesus that Paul was<br>
 greatly disturbed over the troubles in the Corinthian Church. He<br>
 apparently wrote a letter to them now lost to us <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 5:9)</i></b>,<br>
 received messages from the household of Chloe, a letter from the<br>
 church, special messengers, sent Timothy, then Titus, may have<br>
 made a hurried trip himself, wrote our First Corinthians, was<br>
 planning to go after the return of Titus to Troas where he was to<br>
 meet him after Pentecost, when all of a sudden the uproar raised<br>
 by Demetrius hurried Paul away sooner than he had planned.<br>
 Meanwhile Apollos had returned from Corinth to Ephesus and<br>
 refused to go back <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 16:12)</i></b>. Paul doubtless had helpers like<br>
 Epaphras and Philemon who carried the message over the province<br>
 of Asia, Tychicus, and Trophimus of Asia who were with him on the<br>
 last visit to Jerusalem <b><i>(verses <!-#-->22,29; 20:4)</i></b>. Paul's message<br>
 reached Greeks, not merely Hellenists and God-fearers, but some<br>
 of the Greeks in the upper circles of life in Ephesus.<br>
 <br>
 19:11 <B>{Special miracles}</B> <b><i>(\dunameis ou tas tuchousas\)</i></b>. "Powers<br>
 not the ones that happen by chance," "not the ordinary ones,"<br>
 litotes for "the extraordinary." All "miracles" or "powers"<br>
 <b><i>(\dunameis\)</i></b> are supernatural and out of the ordinary, but here<br>
 God regularly wrought <b><i>(\epoiei\)</i></b>, imperfect active) wonders<br>
 beyond those familiar to the disciples and completely different<br>
 from the deeds of the Jewish exorcists. This phrase is peculiar<br>
 to Luke in the N.T. <b><i>(also <!-#-->28:2)</i></b>, but it occurs in the classical<br>
 Greek and in the _Koin&#275;_ as in III Macc. 3:7 and in papyri and<br>
 inscriptions <b><i>(Deissmann, _Bible Studies_, p. 255)</i></b>. In Samaria<br>
 Philip wrought miracles to deliver the people from the influence<br>
 of Simon Magus. Here in Ephesus exorcists and other magicians had<br>
 built an enormous vogue of a false spiritualism and Paul faces<br>
 unseen forces of evil. His tremendous success led some people to<br>
 superstitious practices thinking that there was power in Paul's<br>
 person.<br>
 <br>
 19:12 <B>{Handkerchiefs}</B> <b><i>(\soudaria\)</i></b>. Latin word for \sudor\<br>
 <b><i>(sweat)</i></b>. Used in <!-#-->Lu 19:20; Joh 11:44; 20:7. In two papyri<br>
 marriage-contracts this word occurs among the toilet articles in<br>
 the dowry <b><i>(Deissmann, _Bible Studies_, p. 223)</i></b>. <B>{Aprons}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\simikinthia\)</i></b>. Latin word also, _semicinctilum_ <b><i>(\semi,<br>
 cingo\)</i></b>. Only here in the N.T. Linen aprons used by servants or<br>
 artisans <b><i>(Martial XIV. 153)</i></b>. Paul did manual work at Ephesus<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->20:34)</i></b> and so wore these aprons. <B>{Departed}</B> <b><i>(\apallalsethai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present passive infinitive with \h&#333;ste\ for actual result as in<br>
 verse <!-#-->10. If one wonders how God could honour such<br>
 superstitious faith, he should remember that there is no power in<br>
 superstition or in magic, but in God. If God never honoured any<br>
 faith save that entirely free from superstition, how about<br>
 Christian people who are troubled over the number 13, over the<br>
 moon, the rabbit's foot? The poor woman with an issue of blood<br>
 touched the hem of Christ's garment and was healed <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:44-46)</i></b><br>
 as others sought to do <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 14:36)</i></b>. God condescends to meet us<br>
 in our ignorance and weakness where he can reach us. Elisha had a<br>
 notion that some of the power of Elijah resided in his mantle<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ki 2:13)</i></b>. Some even sought help from Peter's shadow <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 5:15)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 19:13 <B>{Of the strolling Jews, exorcists}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n perierchomen&#333;n<br>
 Ioudai&#333;n exorkist&#333;n\)</i></b>. These exorcists travelled around <b><i>(\peri\)</i></b><br>
 from place to place like modern Gypsy fortune-tellers. The Jews<br>
 were especially addicted to such practices with spells of sorcery<br>
 connected with the name of Solomon <b><i>(Josephus, _Ant_. VIII. 2.5)</i></b>.<br>
 See also Tobit 8:1-3. Jesus alludes to those in Palestine <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 12:27; Lu 11:19)</i></b>. The exorcists were originally those who<br>
 administered an oath <b><i>(from \exorkiz&#333;\, to exact an oath)</i></b>, then to<br>
 use an oath as a spell or charm. Only instance here in the N.T.<br>
 These men regarded Paul as one of their own number just as Simon<br>
 Magus treated Simon Peter. Only here these exorcists paid Paul<br>
 the compliment of imitation instead of offering money as Magus<br>
 did. <B>{To name over}</B> <b><i>(\onomazein epi\)</i></b>. They heard what Paul said<br>
 and treated his words as a magic charm or spell to drive the evil<br>
 spirits out. <B>{I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Horkiz&#333; humas ton I&#275;soun hon Paulos k&#275;russei\)</i></b>. Note two<br>
 accusatives with the verb of swearing <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mr 5:7)</i></b> as a<br>
 causative verb <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 483)</i></b>. The papyri furnish<br>
 numerous instances of \horkiz&#333;\ in such constructions <b><i>(Deissmann,<br>
 _Bible Studies_, p. 281)</i></b>. Note also the article with Jesus, "the<br>
 Jesus," as if to identify the magic word to the demons with the<br>
 addition "whom Paul preaches." They thought that success turned<br>
 on the correct use of the magical formula. The Ephesian mysteries<br>
 included Christianity, so they supposed.<br>
 <br>
 19:14 <B>{Seven sons of Sceva}</B> <b><i>(\Skeu&#257; hepta huioi\)</i></b>. Who this Sceva<br>
 was we do not know. If a high priest, he was highly connected in<br>
 Jerusalem <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->5:24)</i></b>. Some MSS. have ruler instead of priest.<br>
 His name may be Latin in origin. \Skeu&#257;\ has Doric form of<br>
 genitive. But that he had seven sons in this degraded business<br>
 shows how Judaism had fared poorly in this superstitious city.<br>
 Did they imagine there was special power in the number seven?<br>
 <br>
 19:15 <B>{Jesus I know}</B> <b><i>(\ton I&#275;soun gin&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b>. "The <b><i>(whom you<br>
 mention)</i></b> Jesus I recognize <b><i>(\gin&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b>" and "the <b><i>(whom you<br>
 mentioned)</i></b> Paul I am acquainted with <b><i>(\ton Paulon epistamai\)</i></b>."<br>
 Clear distinction between \gin&#333;sk&#333;\ and \epistamai\. <B>{But who are<br>
 ye?}</B> <b><i>(\humeis de tines este?\)</i></b>. But you, who are you? Emphatic<br>
 prolepsis.<br>
 <br>
 19:16 <B>{Leaped on them}</B> <b><i>(\ephalomenos ep' autous\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> middle participle of \ephallomai\, old verb to<br>
 spring upon like a panther, here only in the N.T. <B>{Mastered}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katakurieusas\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b> active participle of<br>
 \katakurieu&#333;\, late verb from \kata\ and \kurios\, to become lord<br>
 or master of. <B>{Both}</B> <b><i>(\amphoter&#333;n\)</i></b>. Papyri examples exist where<br>
 \amphoteroi\ means "all" or more than "two" <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 745)</i></b>. So here \amphoteroi\ includes all seven.<br>
 "Both" in old English was used for more than two. <B>{So that}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\h&#333;ste\)</i></b>. Another example <b><i>(verses <!-#-->10,11)</i></b> of \h&#333;ste\ with the<br>
 infinitive for result. <B>{Naked}</B> <b><i>(\gumnous\)</i></b>. Probably with torn<br>
 garments, <B>{Wounded}</B> <b><i>(\tetraumatismenous\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle of \traumatiz&#333;\, old verb to wound, from \trauma\ <b><i>(a<br>
 wound)</i></b>. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 20:12.<br>
 <br>
 19:17 <B>{Was magnified}</B> <b><i>(\emegaluneto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive. To make<br>
 great. It was a notable victory over the powers of evil in<br>
 Ephesus.<br>
 <br>
 19:18 <B>{Came}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rchonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, kept coming, one<br>
 after another. Even some of the believers were secretly under the<br>
 spell of these false spiritualists just as some Christians today<br>
 cherish private contacts with so-called occult powers through<br>
 mediums, seances, of which they are ashamed. <B>{Confessing}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\exomologoumenoi\)</i></b>. It was time to make a clean breast of it<br>
 all, to turn on the light, to unbosom their secret habits.<br>
 <B>{Declaring their deeds}</B> <b><i>(\anaggellontes tas praxeis aut&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Judgment was beginning at the house of God. The dupes <b><i>(professing<br>
 believers, alas)</i></b> of these jugglers or exorcists now had their<br>
 eyes opened when they saw the utter defeat of the tricksters who<br>
 had tried to use the name of Jesus without his power. The<br>
 boomerang was tremendous. The black arts were now laid bare in<br>
 their real character. Gentile converts had a struggle to shake<br>
 off their corrupt environment.<br>
 <br>
 19:19 <B>{Not a few of them that practised curious arts}</B> <b><i>(\hikanoi<br>
 t&#333;n ta perierga praxant&#333;n\)</i></b>. Considerable number of the<br>
 performers or exorcists themselves who knew that they were<br>
 humbugs were led to renounce their evil practices. The word<br>
 \perierga\ <b><i>(curious)</i></b> is an old word <b><i>(\peri, erga\)</i></b> originally a<br>
 piddler about trifles, a busybody <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 5:13)</i></b>, then impertinent<br>
 and magical things as here. Only two examples in the N.T. It is a<br>
 technical term for magic as the papyri and inscriptions show.<br>
 Deissmann <b><i>(_Bible Studies_, p. 323)</i></b> thinks that these books here<br>
 burned were just like the Magic Papyri now recovered from Egypt.<br>
 <B>{Burned them in the sight of all}</B> <b><i>(\katekaion en&#333;pion pant&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active of \katakai&#333;\. It probably took a good while to<br>
 do it, burned them completely <b><i>(up, we say; down, the Greeks say,<br>
 perfective use of \kata\)</i></b>. These Magical Papyri or slips of<br>
 parchment with symbols or magical sentences written on them<br>
 called \Ephesia Grammata\ <b><i>(Ephesian Letters)</i></b>. These Ephesian<br>
 Letters were worn as amulets or charms. <B>{They brought them<br>
 together}</B> <b><i>(\sunenegkantes\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of<br>
 \sunpher&#333;\. What a glorious conflagration it would be if in every<br>
 city all the salacious, blasphemous, degrading books, pamphlets,<br>
 magazines, and papers could be piled together and burned. <B>{They<br>
 counted}</B> <b><i>(\suneps&#275;phisan\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of<br>
 \sunps&#275;phiz&#333;\, to reckon together. In LXX <b><i>(<!-#-->Jer 29:49)</i></b>. Only<br>
 here in N.T. \Sunkataps&#275;phiz&#333;\ in <!-#-->1:26. <B>{Fifty thousand pieces<br>
 of silver}</B> <b><i>(\arguriou muriadas pente\)</i></b>. Five ten thousand<br>
 <b><i>(\muriadas\)</i></b> pieces of silver. Ephesus was largely Greek and<br>
 probably the silver pieces were Greek drachmae or the Latin<br>
 denarius, probably about ten thousand dollars or two thousand<br>
 English pounds.<br>
 <br>
 19:20 <B>{Mightily}</B> <b><i>(\kata kratos\)</i></b>. According to strength. Only<br>
 here in N.T., common military term in Thucydides. Such proof of a<br>
 change counted. <B>{Grew and prevailed}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;uxanen kai ischuen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect actives, kept growing and gaining strength. It was a<br>
 day of triumph for Christ in Ephesus, this city of vast wealth<br>
 and superstition. Ephesus for centuries will be one of the<br>
 centres of Christian power. Timothy will come here and John the<br>
 Apostle and Polycarp and Irenaeus.<br>
 <br>
 19:21 <B>{Purposed in the spirit}</B> <b><i>(\etheto en t&#333;i pneumati\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist middle indicative for mental action and "spirit" expressed<br>
 also. A new stage in Paul's career begins here, a new division of<br>
 the Acts. <B>{Passed through}</B> <b><i>(\dielth&#333;n\)</i></b>. Word <b><i>(\dierchomai\)</i></b> used<br>
 ten times in Acts <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->19:1)</i></b> of missionary journeys <b><i>(Ramsay)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Macedonia and Achaia}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n Makedonian kai Achaian\)</i></b>. This was<br>
 the way that he actually went, but originally he had planned to<br>
 go to Achaia <b><i>(Corinth)</i></b> and then to Macedonia, as he says in <!-#-->2Co<br>
 1:15f., but he had now changed that purpose, perhaps because of<br>
 the bad news from Corinth. Already when he wrote I Corinthians he<br>
 proposed to go first to Macedonia <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 16:5-7)</i></b>. He even hoped<br>
 to spend the winter in Corinth "if the Lord permit" and to remain<br>
 in Ephesus till Pentecost, neither of which things he did. <B>{I<br>
 must also see Rome}</B> <b><i>(\dei me kai R&#333;m&#275;n idein\)</i></b>. This section of<br>
 Acts begins with Rome in the horizon of Paul's plans and the book<br>
 closes with Paul in Rome <b><i>(Rackham)</i></b>. Here he feels the necessity<br>
 of going as in <!-#-->Ro 1:15 he feels himself "debtor" to all<br>
 including "those in Rome" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:16)</i></b>. Paul had long desired to<br>
 go to Rome <b><i>(<!-#-->Rom 1:10)</i></b>, but had been frequently hindered <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro<br>
 1:13)</i></b>, but he has definitely set his face to go to Rome and on<br>
 to Spain <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 15:23-29)</i></b>. Paley calls sharp attention to this<br>
 parallel between <!-#-->Ac 19:21 and <!-#-->Ro 1:10-15; 15:23-29. Rome had<br>
 a fascination for Paul as the home of Aquila and Priscilla and<br>
 numerous other friends <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 16)</i></b>, but chiefly as the capital of<br>
 the Roman Empire and a necessary goal in Paul's ambition to win<br>
 it to Jesus Christ. His great work in Asia had stirred afresh in<br>
 him the desire to do his part for Rome. He wrote to Rome from<br>
 Corinth not long after this and in Jerusalem Jesus in vision will<br>
 confirm the necessity <b><i>(\dei\)</i></b> that Paul see Rome <b><i>(<!-#-->Acts 23:11)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 19:22 <B>{Timothy and Erastus}</B> <b><i>(\Timotheon kai Eraston\)</i></b>. Paul had<br>
 sent Timothy to Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 4:17)</i></b> and had requested kindly<br>
 treatment of this young minister in his difficult task of<br>
 placating the divided church <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 16:10-11)</i></b> that he might<br>
 return to Paul as he evidently had before Paul leaves Ephesus. He<br>
 then despatched Titus to Corinth to finish what Timothy had not<br>
 quite succeeded in doing with instructions to meet him in Troas.<br>
 Now Timothy and Erastus <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ro 16:23; 2Ti 4:20)</i></b> go on to<br>
 Macedonia to prepare the way for Paul who will come on later. <B>{He<br>
 himself stayed in Asia for a while}</B> <b><i>(\autos epeschen chronon eis<br>
 t&#275;n Asian\)</i></b>. Literally, He himself had additional time in Asia.<br>
 Second aorist active indicative of \epech&#333;\, old and common<br>
 idiom, only here in the N.T. in this sense and the verb only in<br>
 Luke and Paul. The reason for Paul's delay is given by him in<br>
 <!-#-->1Co 16:8f., the great door wide open in Ephesus. Here again<br>
 Luke and Paul supplement each other. Pentecost came towards the<br>
 end of May and May was the month of the festival of Artemis<br>
 <b><i>(Diana)</i></b> when great multitudes would come to Ephesus. But he did<br>
 not remain till Pentecost as both Luke and Paul make plain.<br>
 <br>
 19:23 <B>{No small stir}</B> <b><i>(\tarachos ouk oligos\)</i></b>. Same phrase in<br>
 <!-#-->12:18 and nowhere else in the N.T. Litotes. <B>{Concerning the<br>
 Way}</B> <b><i>(\peri t&#275;s hodou\)</i></b>. See this phrase for Christianity in<br>
 <!-#-->9:2; 19:9; 24:22 which see, like the "Jesus Way" of the<br>
 Indians. There had already been opposition and "stir" before this<br>
 stage <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->19:11-20)</i></b>. The fight with wild beasts in <!-#-->1Co 15:32<br>
 <b><i>(whatever it was)</i></b> was before that Epistle was written and so<br>
 before this new uproar. Paul as a Roman citizen could not be<br>
 thrown to wild beasts, but he so pictured the violent opponents<br>
 of Christ in Ephesus.<br>
 <br>
 19:24 <B>{Demetrius, a silversmith}</B> <b><i>(\D&#275;m&#275;trios argurokopos\)</i></b>. The<br>
 name is common enough and may or may not be the man mentioned in<br>
 <!-#-->3Jo 1:12 who was also from the neighbourhood of Ephesus. There<br>
 is on an inscription at Ephesus near the close of the century a<br>
 Demetrius called \neopoios Artemidos\ a temple warden of Artemis<br>
 <b><i>(Diana)</i></b>. Zoeckler suggests that Luke misunderstood this word<br>
 \neopoios\ and translated it into \argurokopos\, a beater<br>
 <b><i>(\kopt&#333;\, to beat)</i></b> of silver <b><i>(\arguros\, silver)</i></b>, "which made<br>
 silver shrines of Artemis" <b><i>(\poi&#333;n naous\ <b><i>(\argurous\)</i></b><br>
 \Artemidos\)</i></b>. It is true that no silver shrines of the temple<br>
 have been found in Ephesus, but only numerous terra-cotta ones.<br>
 Ramsay suggests that the silver ones would naturally be melted<br>
 down. The date is too late anyhow to identify the Demetrius who<br>
 was \neopoios\ with the Demetrius \argurokopos\ who made little<br>
 silver temples of Artemis, though B does not have the word<br>
 \argurous\. The poor votaries would buy the terra-cotta ones, the<br>
 rich the silver shrines <b><i>(Ramsay, _Paul the Traveller_, p. 278)</i></b>.<br>
 These small models of the temple with the statue of Artemis<br>
 inside would be set up in the houses or even worn as amulets. It<br>
 is a pity that the Revised Version renders Artemis here. Diana as<br>
 the Ephesian Artemis is quite distinct from the Greek Artemis,<br>
 the sister of Apollo, the Diana of the Romans. This temple, built<br>
 in the 6th century B.C., was burnt by Herostratus Oct. 13 B.C.<br>
 356, the night when Alexander the Great was born. It was restored<br>
 and was considered one of the seven wonders of the world. Artemis<br>
 was worshipped as the goddess of fertility, like the Lydian<br>
 Cybele, a figure with many breasts. The great festival in May<br>
 would offer Demetrius a golden opportunity for the sale of the<br>
 shrines. <B>{Brought no little business}</B> <b><i>(\pareicheto ouk olig&#275;n<br>
 ergasian\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, continued to bring <b><i>(furnish,<br>
 provide)</i></b>. The middle accents the part that Demetrius played as<br>
 the leader of the guild of silversmiths, work for himself and for<br>
 them. <B>{Unto the craftsmen}</B> <b><i>(\tais technitais\)</i></b>. The artisans from<br>
 \techn&#275;\ <b><i>(craft, art)</i></b>. Trade guilds were common in the ancient<br>
 world. Demetrius had probably organized this guild and provided<br>
 the capital for the enterprise.<br>
 <br>
 19:25 <B>{Whom he gathered together}</B> <b><i>(\hous sunathroisas\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active participle of \sunathroiz&#333;\, old verb to assemble<br>
 together <b><i>(\athroos\, a crowd)</i></b>, in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ac<br>
 12:12. <B>{With the workmen of like occupation}</B> <b><i>(\kai tous peri ta<br>
 toiauta ergatas\)</i></b>. "And the workmen concerning such things,"<br>
 apparently those who made the marble and terra-cotta shrines who<br>
 would also be affected in the same way. It was a gathering of the<br>
 associated trades, not for a strike, for employer and employees<br>
 met together, but in protest against the preaching of Paul. <B>{We<br>
 have our wealth}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; euporia h&#275;min estin\)</i></b>. The wealth is to us<br>
 <b><i>(dative of possession)</i></b>. This old word for wealth occurs here<br>
 alone in the N.T. It is from \eu\ and \poros\, easy to pass<br>
 through, easy to accomplish, to be well off, wealthy, welfare,<br>
 weal, well-being, rich. Demetrius appeals to this knowledge and<br>
 self-interest of the artisans as the basis for their zeal for<br>
 Artemis, piety for revenue.<br>
 <br>
 19:26 <B>{At Ephesus}</B> <b><i>(\Ephesou\)</i></b>. Genitive of place as also with<br>
 \Asias\ <b><i>(Asia)</i></b>. Cf. Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 494f. <B>{This Paul}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ho Paulos houtos\)</i></b>. Contemptuous use of \houtos\. <B>{Hath turned<br>
 away}</B> <b><i>(\metest&#275;sen\)</i></b>. Changed, transposed. First aorist active<br>
 indicative, did change. Tribute to Paul's powers as a preacher<br>
 borne out by Luke's record in <!-#-->19:10. There may be an element of<br>
 exaggeration on the part of Demetrius to incite the workmen to<br>
 action, for the worship of Artemis was their wealth. Paul had cut<br>
 the nerve of their business. There had long been a Jewish colony<br>
 in Ephesus, but their protest against idolatry was as nothing<br>
 compared with Paul's preaching <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. <B>{Which are made with<br>
 hands}</B> <b><i>(\hoi dia cheir&#333;n ginomenoi\)</i></b>. Note the present tense,<br>
 made from time to time. No doubt Paul had put the point sharply<br>
 as in Athens <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 17:29)</i></b>. Isaiah <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 44:9-17)</i></b> had pictured<br>
 graphically the absurdity of worshipping stocks and stones,<br>
 flatly forbidden by the Old Testament <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 20:4; Ps 135:15-18)</i></b>.<br>
 The people identified their gods with the images of them and<br>
 Demetrius reflects that point of view. He was jealous of the<br>
 brand of gods turned out by his factory. The artisans would stand<br>
 by him on this point. It was a reflection on their work.<br>
 <br>
 19:27 <B>{This our trade}</B> <b><i>(\touto to meros\)</i></b>. Part, share, task,<br>
 job, trade. <B>{Come into disrepute}</B> <b><i>(\eis apelegmon elthein\)</i></b>. Not<br>
 in the old writers, but in LXX and _Koin&#275;_. Literally,<br>
 reputation, exposure, censure, rejection after examination, and<br>
 so disrepute. Their business of making gods would lose caste as<br>
 the liquor trade <b><i>(still called the trade in England)</i></b> has done in<br>
 our day. They felt this keenly and so Demetrius names it first.<br>
 They felt it in their pockets. <B>{Of the great goddess Artemis}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\t&#275;s megal&#275;s theas Artemidos\)</i></b>. She was generally known as the<br>
 Great <b><i>(\h&#275; Megal&#275;\)</i></b>. An inscription found at Ephesus calls her<br>
 "the greatest god" <b><i>(\h&#275; megist&#275; theos\)</i></b>. The priests were eunuchs<br>
 and there were virgin priestesses and a lower order of slaves<br>
 known as temple-sweepers <b><i>(\ne&#333;koroi\, verse <!-#-->35)</i></b>. They had wild<br>
 orgiastic exercises that were disgraceful with their Corybantic<br>
 processions and revelries. <B>{Be made of no account}</B> <b><i>(\eis outhen<br>
 logisth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. Be reckoned as nothing, first aorist passive<br>
 infinitive of \logizomai\ and \eis\. <B>{Should even be deposed of<br>
 her magnificence}</B> <b><i>(\mellein te kai kathaireisthai t&#275;s<br>
 megaleiot&#275;tos aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Note the present infinitive after<br>
 \mellein\, ablative case <b><i>(so best MSS.)</i></b> after \kathaire&#333;\, to<br>
 take down, to depose, to deprive of. The word \megaleiot&#275;s\<br>
 occurs also in <!-#-->Lu 9:43 <b><i>(the majesty of God)</i></b> and in <!-#-->2Pe 1:16<br>
 of the transfiguration of Christ. It is already in the LXX and<br>
 Deissmann <b><i>(_Light from the Ancient East_, p. 363)</i></b> thinks that the<br>
 word runs parallel with terms used in the emperor-cult. <B>{All Asia<br>
 and the world}</B> \hol&#275; <b><i>(h&#275;)</i></b> Asia kai <b><i>(h&#275;)</i></b> oikoumen&#275;\. See <!-#-->11:28<br>
 for same use of \oikoumen&#275;\. An exaggeration, to be sure, but<br>
 Pausanias says that no deity was more widely worshipped. Temples<br>
 of Artemis have been found in Spain and Gaul. _Multitudo<br>
 errantium non efficit veritatem_ <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>. Even today heathenism<br>
 has more followers than Christianity. To think that all this<br>
 splendour was being set at naught by one man and a despised Jew<br>
 at that!<br>
 <br>
 19:28 <B>{They were filled with wrath}</B> <b><i>(\genomenoi plereis thumou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Having become full of wrath. <B>{Cried out}</B> <b><i>(\ekrazon\)</i></b>. Inchoative<br>
 imperfect, began to cry out and kept it up continuously.<br>
 Reiteration was characteristic of the orgiastic exercises. The<br>
 Codex Bezae adds after \thumou\ <b><i>(wrath)</i></b>: \Dramontes eis t&#275;n<br>
 amphodon\ <b><i>(running into the street)</i></b>, which they certainly did<br>
 after the speech of Demetrius. <B>{Great is Artemis of the<br>
 Ephesians}</B> <b><i>(\Megal&#275; h&#275; Artemis Ephesi&#333;n\)</i></b>. D <b><i>(Codex Bezae)</i></b> omits<br>
 \h&#275;\ <b><i>(the)</i></b> and makes it read: "Great Artemis of the Ephesians."<br>
 This was the usual cry of the votaries in their orgies as the<br>
 inscriptions show, an ejaculatory outcry or prayer instead of an<br>
 argument as the other MSS. have it. That is vivid and natural<br>
 <b><i>(Ramsay, _Church in the Roman Empire_, pp. 135ff.)</i></b>. Yet on this<br>
 occasion the artisans were making an argumentative protest and<br>
 plea against Paul. An inscription at Dionysopolis has "Great is<br>
 Apollo."<br>
 <br>
 19:29 <B>{With the confusion}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;s sugchuse&#333;s\)</i></b>. Genitive case<br>
 after \epl&#275;sth&#275;\. An old word, but in the N.T. only here, from<br>
 verb \sugche&#333;\, to pour together like a flood <b><i>(only in Acts in<br>
 the N.T.)</i></b>. Vivid description of the inevitable riot that followed<br>
 "the appearance of such a body in the crowded agora of an<br>
 excitable city" <b><i>(Rackham)</i></b> "vociferating the city's watch-word."<br>
 <B>{They rushed}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;rm&#275;san\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist active indicative<br>
 of \horma&#333;\, old verb for impetuous dashing, a case of mob<br>
 psychology <b><i>(mob mind)</i></b>, with one accord <b><i>(\homothumadon\ as in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 1:14, etc.)</i></b>. <B>{Into the theatre}</B> <b><i>(\eis to theatron\)</i></b>. A place for<br>
 seeing <b><i>(\theaomai\)</i></b> spectacles, originally for dramatic<br>
 representation <b><i>(Thucydides, Herodotus)</i></b>, then for the spectators,<br>
 then for the spectacle or show <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 4:9)</i></b>. The theatre<br>
 <b><i>(amphitheatre)</i></b> at Ephesus can still be traced in the ruins <b><i>(Wood,<br>
 _Ephesus_)</i></b> and shows that it was of enormous size capable of<br>
 seating fifty-six thousand persons <b><i>(some estimate it only<br>
 24,500)</i></b>. It was the place for large public gatherings of any sort<br>
 out of doors like our football and baseball parks. In particular,<br>
 gladiatorial shows were held in these theatres. <B>{Having seized<br>
 Gaius and Aristarchus men of Macedonia}</B> <b><i>(\sunarpasantes Gaion kai<br>
 Aristarchon Makedonas\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->6:12 for this same verb. They<br>
 wanted some victims for this "gladiatorial" show. These two men<br>
 were "Paul's companions in travel" <b><i>(\sunekd&#275;mous Paulou\)</i></b>,<br>
 together <b><i>(\sun\)</i></b> with Paul in being abroad, away from home or<br>
 people <b><i>(\ek-d&#275;mous\, late word, in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->2Co<br>
 8:19)</i></b>. How the mob got hold of Gaius <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:4)</i></b> and Aristarchus<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->20:4; 27:2; Col 4:10; Phm 1:24)</i></b> we do not know whether by<br>
 accidental recognition or by search after failure to get Paul. In<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 16:4 Paul speaks of Priscilla and Aquila as those "who for<br>
 my life laid down their own necks." Paul lived with them in<br>
 Ephesus as in Corinth. It is possible that Demetrius led the mob<br>
 to their house and that they refused to allow Paul to go or to be<br>
 seized at the risk of their own lives. Paul himself may have been<br>
 desperately ill at this time as we know was the case once during<br>
 his stay in Ephesus when he felt the answer of death in himself<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 1:9)</i></b> and when God rescued him. That may mean that, ill as<br>
 he was, Paul wanted to go and face the mob in the theatre,<br>
 knowing that it meant certain death.<br>
 <br>
 19:30 <B>{And when Paul was minded to enter in unto the people}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Paulou de boulomenou eiselthein eis ton d&#275;mon\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute. Plainly Paul wanted to face the howling mob, whether it<br>
 was the occasion pictured in <!-#-->2Co 1:9 or not. "St. Paul was not<br>
 the man to leave his comrades in the lurch" <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. <B>{Suffered<br>
 him not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk ei&#333;n auton\)</i></b>. Imperfect of \ea&#333;\, common verb to<br>
 allow, what Gildersleeve called the negative imperfect<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 885)</i></b>, denoting resistance to pressure.<br>
 The more Paul insisted on going the more the disciples refused to<br>
 agree to it and they won.<br>
 <br>
 19:31 <B>{Certain also of the chief officers of Asia}</B> <b><i>(\tines de kai<br>
 t&#333;n Asiarch&#333;n\)</i></b>. These "Asiarchs" were ten officers elected by<br>
 cities in the province who celebrated at their own cost public<br>
 games and festivals <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. Each province had such a group of men<br>
 chosen, as we now know from inscriptions, to supervise the funds<br>
 connected with the worship of the emperor, to preside at games<br>
 and festivals even when the temple services were to gods like<br>
 Artemis. Only rich men could act, but the position was eagerly<br>
 sought. <B>{Being his friends}</B> <b><i>(\ontes aut&#333;i philoi\)</i></b>. Evidently the<br>
 Asiarchs had a high opinion of Paul and were unwilling for him to<br>
 expose his life to a wild mob during the festival of Artemis.<br>
 They were at least tolerant toward Paul and his preaching. "It<br>
 was an Asiarch who at Smyrna resisted the cry of the populace to<br>
 throw Polycarp to the lions" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. <B>{Besought him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\parekaloun auton\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, showing that the<br>
 messengers sent had to insist over Paul's protest. "<B>{Not to<br>
 adventure himself}</B>" <b><i>(\m&#275; dounai heauton\)</i></b>. It was a hazard, a<br>
 rash adventure "to give himself" <b><i>(second aorist active infinitive<br>
 of \did&#333;mi\)</i></b>. Just this sense of "adventure" with the idiom<br>
 occurs only here in the N.T., though in Polybius V., 14, 9. But<br>
 the phrase itself Paul uses of Jesus who gave himself for our<br>
 sins <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 1:4; 1Ti 2:6; Tit 2:14)</i></b>. It is not the first time that<br>
 friends had rescued Paul from peril <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 9:25,30; 17:10,14)</i></b>. The<br>
 theatre was no place for Paul. It meant certain death.<br>
 <br>
 19:32 <B>{Some therefore cried one thing and some another}</B> <b><i>(\alloi<br>
 men oun allo ti ekrazon\)</i></b>. This classical use of \allos allo\<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 747)</i></b> appears also in <!-#-->2:12; 21:34.<br>
 Literally, "others cried another thing." The imperfect shows the<br>
 repetition <b><i>(kept on crying)</i></b> and confusion which is also<br>
 distinctly stated. <B>{For the assembly was in confusion}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n gar<br>
 h&#275; ekkl&#275;sia sunkechumen&#275;\)</i></b>. The reason for the previous<br>
 statement. Periphrastic past perfect passive of \sugche&#333;,<br>
 sugchun&#333; <b><i>(-unn&#333;)</i></b>\, to pour together, to commingle as in verse<br>
 <!-#-->29 <b><i>(\sugchuse&#333;s\)</i></b>. It was not an "assembly" <b><i>(\ekkl&#275;sia, ek,<br>
 kale&#333;\, to call out)</i></b>, but a wholly irregular, disorganized mob in<br>
 a state <b><i>(perfect tense)</i></b> of confusion. There was "a lawful<br>
 assembly" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->39)</i></b>, but this mob was not one. Luke shows his<br>
 contempt for this mob <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. <B>{Had come together}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sunel&#275;lutheisan\)</i></b>. Past perfect active of \sunerchomai\. It was<br>
 an assembly only in one sense. For some reason Demetrius who was<br>
 responsible for the mob preferred now to keep in the background,<br>
 though he was known to be the ring-leader of the gathering <b><i>(verse<br>
 <!-#-->38)</i></b>. It was just a mob that shouted because others did.<br>
 <br>
 19:33 <B>{And they brought Alexander out of the crowd}</B> <b><i>(\ek de tou<br>
 ochlou sunebibasan Alexandron\)</i></b>. The correct text <b><i>(Aleph A B)</i></b> has<br>
 this verb \sunebibasan\ <b><i>(from \sunbibaz&#333;\, to put together)</i></b><br>
 instead of \proebibasan\ <b><i>(from \probibaz&#333;\, to put forward)</i></b>. It<br>
 is a graphic word, causal of \bain&#333;\, to go, and occurs in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 16:10; Col 2:19; Eph 4:16. Evidently some of the Jews grew<br>
 afraid that the mob would turn on the Jews as well as on the<br>
 Christians. Paul was a Jew and so was Aristarchus, one of the<br>
 prisoners. The Jews were as strongly opposed to idolatry as were<br>
 the Christians. <B>{The Jews putting him forward}</B> <b><i>(\probalont&#333;n<br>
 auton t&#333;n Ioudai&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute of the second aorist<br>
 active participle of \proball&#333;\, old verb to push forward as<br>
 leaves in the spring <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 21:30)</i></b>. In the N.T. only in these two<br>
 passages. Alexandria had already disgraceful scenes of<br>
 Jew-baiting and there was real peril now in Ephesus with this<br>
 wild mob. So Alexander was pushed forward as the champion to<br>
 defend the Jews to the excited mob. He may be the same Alexander<br>
 the coppersmith who did Paul much evil <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 4:14)</i></b>, against whom<br>
 Paul will warn Timothy then in Ephesus. "The Jews were likely to<br>
 deal in the copper and silver required for the shrines, so he may<br>
 have had some trade connexion with the craftsmen which would give<br>
 him influence" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. <B>{Beckoned with the hand}</B> <b><i>(\kataseisas<br>
 t&#275;n cheira\)</i></b>. Old verb \katasei&#333;\, to shake down, here the hand,<br>
 rapidly waving the hand up and down to get a hearing. In the N.T.<br>
 elsewhere only in <!-#-->Ac 12:17; 13:16; 21:40 where "with the hand"<br>
 <b><i>(\t&#275;i cheiri\, instrumental case)</i></b> is used instead of \t&#275;n cheira\<br>
 <b><i>(the accusative)</i></b>. <B>{Would have made a defence unto the people}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;thelen apologeisthai t&#333;i d&#275;m&#333;i\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, wanted to<br>
 make a defence, tried to, started to, but apparently never got<br>
 out a word. \Apologeisthai\ <b><i>(present middle infinitive, direct<br>
 middle, to defend oneself)</i></b>, regular word for formal apology, but<br>
 in N.T. only by Luke and Paul <b><i>(twice in Gospel, six times in<br>
 Acts, and in <!-#-->Ro 2:15; 2Co 12:19)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 19:34 <B>{When they perceived}</B> <b><i>(\epignontes\)</i></b>. Recognizing, coming<br>
 to know fully and clearly <b><i>(\epi-\)</i></b>, second aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b><br>
 active participle of \epigin&#333;sk&#333;\. The masculine plural is left<br>
 as nominative absolute or \pendens\ without a verb. The rioters<br>
 saw at once that Alexander was <b><i>(\estin\, present tense retained<br>
 in indirect assertion)</i></b> a Jew by his features. <B>{An with one voice<br>
 cried out}</B> <b><i>(\ph&#333;n&#275; egeneto mia ek pant&#333;n krazont&#333;n\)</i></b>. Anacoluthon<br>
 or construction according to sense. Literally, "one voice arose<br>
 from all crying." \Krazont&#333;n\ agrees in case <b><i>(ablative)</i></b> with<br>
 \pant&#333;n\, but Aleph A have \krazontes\. This loose construction<br>
 is not uncommon <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 436f.)</i></b>. Now at last<br>
 the crowd became unanimous <b><i>(one voice)</i></b> at the sight of a hated<br>
 Jew about to defend their attacks on the worship of Artemis. The<br>
 unanimity lasted "about the space of two hours" <b><i>(\hosei epi h&#333;ras<br>
 duo\)</i></b>, "as if for two hours." Their creed centred in this<br>
 prolonged yell: "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians" with which<br>
 the disturbance started <b><i>(verse <!-#-->28)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 19:35 <B>{The town-clerk}</B> <b><i>(\ho grammateus\)</i></b>. Ephesus was a free city<br>
 and elected its own officers and the recorder or secretary was<br>
 the chief magistrate of the city, though the proconsul of the<br>
 province of Asia resided there. This officer is not a mere<br>
 secretary of another officer or like the copyists and students of<br>
 the law among the Jews, but the most influential person in<br>
 Ephesus who drafted decrees with the aid of the \strat&#275;goi\, had<br>
 charge of the city's money, was the power in control of the<br>
 assembly, and communicated directly with the proconsul.<br>
 Inscriptions at Ephesus give frequently this very title for their<br>
 chief officer and the papyri have it also. The precise function<br>
 varied in different cities. His name appeared on the coin at<br>
 Ephesus issued in his year of office. <B>{Had quieted the multitude}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katasteilas ton ochlon\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle of<br>
 \katastell&#333;\, to send down, arrange dress <b><i>(Euripides)</i></b>, lower<br>
 <b><i>(Plutarch)</i></b>, restrain <b><i>(papyrus example)</i></b>, only twice in the N.T.<br>
 <b><i>(here and verse <!-#-->36, be quiet)</i></b>, but in LXX and Josephus. He<br>
 evidently took the rostrum and his very presence as the city's<br>
 chief officer had a quieting effect on the billowy turmoil and a<br>
 semblance of order came. He waited, however, till the hubbub had<br>
 nearly exhausted itself <b><i>(two hours)</i></b> and did not speak till there<br>
 was a chance to be heard. <B>{Saith}</B> <b><i>(\ph&#275;sin\)</i></b>. Historical present<br>
 for vividness. <B>{How that}</B>. Merely participle \ousan\ and<br>
 accusative \polin\ in indirect discourse, no conjunction at all<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 1040ff.)</i></b>, common idiom after<br>
 \gin&#333;sk&#333;\, to know. <B>{Temple-keeper}</B> <b><i>(\ne&#333;koron\)</i></b>. Old word from<br>
 \ne&#333;s\ <b><i>(\naos)</i></b>\, temple, and \kore&#333;\, to sweep. Warden, verger,<br>
 cleaner of the temple, a sacristan. So in Xenophon and Plato.<br>
 Inscriptions so describe Ephesus as \ne&#333;koron t&#275;s Artemidos\ as<br>
 Luke has it here and also applied to the imperial _cultus_ which<br>
 finally had several such temples in Ephesus. Other cities claimed<br>
 the same honour of being \ne&#333;koros\, but it was the peculiar<br>
 boast of Ephesus because of the great temple of Artemis. A coin<br>
 of A.D. 65 describes Ephesus as \ne&#333;koros\. There are papyri<br>
 examples of the term applied to individuals, one to Priene as<br>
 \ne&#333;koros\ of the temple in Ephesus <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan,<br>
 _Vocabulary_)</i></b>. <B>{And of the image which fell down from Jupiter}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai tou diopetous\)</i></b>. Supply \agalma\ <b><i>(image)</i></b>, "the from<br>
 heaven-fallen image." From Zeus <b><i>(\Dios\)</i></b> and \pet&#333;\ <b><i>(\pipt&#333;,<br>
 pipet&#333;\)</i></b>, to fall. Zeus <b><i>(Jupiter)</i></b> was considered lord of the sky<br>
 or heaven and that is the idea in \diopetous\ here. The legend<br>
 about a statue fallen from heaven occurs concerning the statue of<br>
 Artemis at Tauris, Minerva at Athens, etc. Thus the recorder<br>
 soothed the vanity <b><i>(Rackham)</i></b> of the crowd by appeal to the<br>
 world-wide fame of Ephesus as sacristan of Artemis and of her<br>
 heaven-fallen image.<br>
 <br>
 19:36 <B>{Cannot be gainsaid}</B> <b><i>(\anantir&#275;t&#333;n oun ont&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute with \oun\ <b><i>(therefore)</i></b>. Undeniable <b><i>(\an, anti, r&#275;tos\)</i></b>,<br>
 verbal adjective. Occasionally in late Greek <b><i>(Polybius, etc.)</i></b>,<br>
 only here in N.T., but adverb \anantir&#275;t&#333;s\ in <!-#-->Ac 10:29. These<br>
 legends were accepted as true and appeased the mob. <B>{Ye ought}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\deon estin\)</i></b>. It is necessary. Periphrastic present indicative<br>
 instead of \dei\ like <!-#-->1Pe 1:6; 1Ti 5:13f. <B>{Be quiet}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katestalmenous\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of \katastell&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(see verse <!-#-->35)</i></b>. <B>{Rash}</B> <b><i>(\propetes\)</i></b>. Old adjective from \pro\<br>
 and \pet&#333;\, to fall forward, headlong, precipitate. In the N.T.<br>
 only here and <!-#-->2Ti 3:4, though common in the _Koin&#275;_. Better<br>
 look before you leap.<br>
 <br>
 19:37 <B>{Neither robbers of temples}</B> <b><i>(\oute hierosulous\)</i></b>. Common<br>
 word in Greek writers from \hieron\, temple, and \sula&#333;\, to rob,<br>
 be guilty of sacrilege. The word is found also on inscriptions in<br>
 Ephesus. The Jews were sometimes guilty of this crime <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro<br>
 2:22)</i></b>, since the heathen temples often had vast treasures like<br>
 banks. The ancients felt as strongly about temple-robbing as<br>
 westerners used to feel about a horse-thief. <B>{Nor blasphemers of<br>
 our goddess}</B> <b><i>(\oute blasph&#275;mountas t&#275;n theon h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. Nor those<br>
 who blasphemed our goddess. That is to say, these men <b><i>(Gaius and<br>
 Aristarchus)</i></b> as Christians had so conducted themselves <b><i>(<!-#-->Col<br>
 4:5)</i></b> that no charge could be placed against them either in act<br>
 <b><i>(temple-robbery)</i></b> or word <b><i>(blasphemy)</i></b>. They had done a rash thing<br>
 since these men are innocent. Paul had used tact in Ephesus as in<br>
 Athens in avoiding illegalities.<br>
 <br>
 19:38 <B>{Have a matter against any one}</B> <b><i>(\echousin pros tina<br>
 logon\)</i></b>. For this use of \ech&#333; logon\ with \pros\ see <!-#-->Mt 5:32;<br>
 Col 3:13. The town-clerk names Demetrius and the craftsmen<br>
 <b><i>(\technitai\)</i></b> as the parties responsible for the riot. <B>{The<br>
 courts are open}</B> <b><i>(\agoraioi agontai\)</i></b>. Supply \h&#275;merai\ <b><i>(days)</i></b>,<br>
 court days are kept, or \sunodoi\, court-meetings are now going<br>
 on, Vulgate _conventus forenses aguntur_. Old adjective from<br>
 \agora\ <b><i>(forum)</i></b> marketplace where trials were held. Cf. <!-#-->Ac<br>
 17:4. There were regular court days whether they were in session<br>
 then or not. <B>{And there are proconsuls}</B> <b><i>(\kai anthupatoi eisin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Asia was a senatorial province and so had proconsuls <b><i>(general<br>
 phrase)</i></b> though only one at a time, "a rhetorical plural"<br>
 <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. Page quotes from an inscription of the age of Trajan<br>
 on an aqueduct at Ephesus in which some of Luke's very words<br>
 occur <b><i>(\ne&#333;koros, anthupatos, grammateus, d&#275;mos\)</i></b>. <B>{Let them<br>
 accuse one another}</B> <b><i>(\egkaleit&#333;san all&#275;lois\)</i></b>. Present active<br>
 imperative of \egkale&#333;\ <b><i>(\en, kale&#333;\)</i></b>, old verb to call in one's<br>
 case, to bring a charge against, with the dative. Luke uses the<br>
 verb six times in Acts for judicial proceedings <b><i>(<!-#-->19:38,40;<br>
 23:28,29; 26:2,7)</i></b>. The town-clerk makes a definite appeal to the<br>
 mob for orderly legal procedure as opposed to mob violence in a<br>
 matter where money and religious prejudice unite, a striking<br>
 rebuke to so-called lynch-law proceedings in lands today where<br>
 Christianity is supposed to prevail.<br>
 <br>
 19:39 <B>{Anything about other matters}</B> <b><i>(\ti peraiter&#333;\)</i></b>. Most MSS.<br>
 here have \ti peri heter&#333;n\, but B b Vulgate read \ti peraiter&#333;\<br>
 as in Plato's \Phaedo\. Several papyri examples of it also. It is<br>
 comparative \peraiteros\ of \pera\, beyond. Note also \epi\ in<br>
 \epiz&#275;teite\. Charges of illegal conduct <b><i>(Page)</i></b> should be settled<br>
 in the regular legal way. But, if you wish to go further and pass<br>
 resolutions about the matter exciting you, "it shall be settled<br>
 in the regular assembly" <b><i>(\en t&#333;i ennom&#333;i ekkl&#275;si&#257;i\)</i></b>. "In the<br>
 lawful assembly," not by a mob like this. Wood <b><i>(_Ephesus_)</i></b> quotes<br>
 an inscription there with this very phrase "at every lawful<br>
 assembly" <b><i>(\kata p&#257;san ennomon ekkl&#275;sian\)</i></b>. The Roman officials<br>
 alone could give the sanction for calling such a lawful or<br>
 regular assembly. The verb \epilu&#333;\ is an old one, but in the<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mr 4:34 <b><i>(which see)</i></b> where Jesus privately<br>
 opened or disclosed the parables to the disciples. The papyri<br>
 give examples of the verb in financial transactions as well as of<br>
 the metaphorical sense. The solution will come in the lawful<br>
 assembly, not in a riot like this. See also <!-#-->2Pe 1:20 where the<br>
 substantive \epilusis\ occurs for disclosure or revelation<br>
 <b><i>(prophecy)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 19:40 <B>{For indeed we are in danger to be accused concerning this<br>
 day's riot}</B> <b><i>(\kai gar kinduneuomen egkaleisthai stase&#333;s peri t&#275;s<br>
 s&#275;meron\)</i></b>. The text is uncertain. The text of Westcott and Hort<br>
 means "to be accused of insurrection concerning today's<br>
 assembly." The peril was real. \Kinduneuomen\, from \kindunos\,<br>
 danger, peril. Old verb, but in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 8:23;<br>
 1Co 15:30. <B>{There being no cause for it}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;denos aitiou<br>
 huparchontos\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute with \aitios\, common adjective<br>
 <b><i>(cf. \aitia\, cause)</i></b> though in N.T. only here and <!-#-->Heb 5:9; Lu<br>
 23:4,14,22. <B>{And as touching it}</B> <b><i>(\peri hou\)</i></b>. "Concerning<br>
 which." But what? No clear antecedent, only the general idea.<br>
 <B>{Give an account of this concourse}</B> <b><i>(\apodounai logon peri t&#275;s<br>
 sustroph&#275;s taut&#275;s\)</i></b>. _Rationem reddere_. They will have to<br>
 explain matters to the proconsul. \Sustroph&#275;\ <b><i>(from \sun\,<br>
 together, \streph&#333;\, to turn)</i></b> is a late word for a conspiracy<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 23:12)</i></b> and a disorderly riot as here <b><i>(Polybius)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Ac<br>
 28:12 \sustreph&#333;\ is used of gathering up a bundle of sticks and<br>
 of men combining in <!-#-->Mt 17:22. Seneca says that there was<br>
 nothing on which the Romans looked with such jealousy as a<br>
 tumultuous meeting.<br>
 <br>
 19:41 <B>{Dismissed the assembly}</B> <b><i>(\apelusen t&#275;n ekkl&#275;sian\)</i></b>. The<br>
 town-clerk thus gave a semblance of law and order to the mob by<br>
 formally dismissing them, this much to protect them against the<br>
 charge to which they were liable. This vivid, graphic picture<br>
 given by Luke has all the earmarks of historical accuracy. Paul<br>
 does not describe the incidents in his letters, was not in the<br>
 theatre in fact, but Luke evidently obtained the details from one<br>
 who was there. Aristarchus, we know, was with Luke in Caesarea<br>
 and in Rome and could have supplied all the data necessary.<br>
 Certainly both Gaius and Aristarchus were lively witnesses of<br>
 these events since their own lives were involved.<br>
