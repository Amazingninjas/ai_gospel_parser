<p>12:1 <B>{About that time}</B> <b><i>(\kat' ekeinon ton kairon\)</i></b>. Same phrase<br>
 in <!-#-->Ro 9:9. That is, the early part of A.D. 44 since that is the<br>
 date of Herod's death. As already suggested, Barnabas and Saul<br>
 came down from Antioch to Jerusalem after the persecution by<br>
 Herod at the end of 44 or the beginning of 45. <B>{Herod the king}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\H&#275;r&#333;id&#275;s ho basileus\)</i></b>. Accurate title at this particular time.<br>
 Herod Agrippa I, grandson of Herod the Great, was King of<br>
 Palestine A.D. 42 to 44; only for these three years was a Herod<br>
 king over Palestine since the death of Herod the Great and never<br>
 afterwards. Archelaus never actually became king though he had<br>
 the popular title at first <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 2:22)</i></b>. <B>{Put forth his hands}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epebalen tas cheiras\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative of<br>
 \epiball&#333;\, old verb, to cast upon or against. The same idiom<br>
 with \tas cheiras\ <b><i>(the hands, common Greek idiom with article<br>
 rather than possessive pronoun)</i></b> in <!-#-->4:3; 5:18. <B>{To afflict}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kak&#333;sai\)</i></b>. First aorist active infinitive of \kako&#333;\, old word<br>
 to do harm or evil to <b><i>(\kakos\)</i></b>, already in <!-#-->7:6,19. Outside of<br>
 Acts in the N.T. only <!-#-->1Pe 5:13. Infinitive of purpose. Probably<br>
 the first who were afflicted were scourged or imprisoned, not put<br>
 to death. It had been eight years or more since the persecution<br>
 over the death of Stephen ceased with the conversion of Saul. But<br>
 the disciples were not popular in Jerusalem with either Sadducees<br>
 or Pharisees. The overtures to the Gentiles in Caesarea and<br>
 Antioch may have stirred up the Pharisees afresh <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->6:14)</i></b>.<br>
 Herod Agrippa I was an Idumean through his grandfather Herod the<br>
 Great and a grandson of Mariamne the Maccabean princess. He was a<br>
 favourite of Caligula the Roman Emperor and was anxious to<br>
 placate his Jewish subjects while retaining the favour of the<br>
 Romans. So he built theatres and held games for the Romans and<br>
 Greeks and slew the Christians to please the Jews. Josephus<br>
 <b><i>(_Ant_. XIX. 7, 3)</i></b> calls him a pleasant vain man scrupulously<br>
 observing Jewish rites. Here we have for the first time political<br>
 power <b><i>(after Pilate)</i></b> used against the disciples.<br>
 <br>
 12:2 <B>{James the brother of John}</B> <b><i>(\Iak&#333;bon ton adelphon I&#333;anou\)</i></b>.<br>
 He had been called by Jesus a son of thunder along with his<br>
 brother John. Jesus had predicted a bloody death for both of them<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 10:38ff.; Mt 20:23)</i></b>. James is the first of the apostles to<br>
 die and John probably the last. He is not James the Lord's<br>
 brother <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 1:19)</i></b>. We do not know why Luke tells so little<br>
 about the death of James and so much about the death of Stephen<br>
 nor do we know why Herod selected him as a victim. Eusebius<br>
 <b><i>(_H.E_. ii. 9)</i></b> quotes Clement of Alexandria as saying that a Jew<br>
 made accusations against James and was converted and beheaded at<br>
 the same time with him. <B>{Killed with the sword}</B> <b><i>(\aneilen<br>
 machair&#275;i\)</i></b>. The verb is a favourite one with Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 2:33;<br>
 5:33,36; 7:28; 9:23-29; 10:39, etc.)</i></b>. Instrumental case and<br>
 Ionic form of \machaira\. The Jews considered beheading a<br>
 shameful death as in the case of the Baptist <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 14:10)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:3 <B>{That it pleased the Jews}</B> <b><i>(\hoti areston estin tois<br>
 Ioudaiois\)</i></b>. Indirect assertion with the present tense \estin\<br>
 retained. \Areston\ is the verbal adjective from \aresk&#333;\<br>
 followed by the dative as in <!-#-->Joh 8:29. <B>{Proceeded to seize}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\prosetheto sullabein\)</i></b>. A patent Hebraism in <!-#-->Lu 20:11f.<br>
 already, and nowhere else in the N.T. It occurs in the LXX <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge<br>
 4:2; 8:12; 18:29, etc.)</i></b>. Second aorist middle indicative of<br>
 \prostith&#275;mi\ and the second aorist active infinitive of<br>
 \sullamban&#333;\. Literally, he added to seize, he seized Peter in<br>
 addition to James. <B>{The days of unleavened bread}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;merai t&#333;n<br>
 azum&#333;n\)</i></b>. By this parenthesis Luke locates the time of the year<br>
 when Peter was arrested, the passover. It was a fine occasion for<br>
 Agrippa to increase his favour among the crowds of Jews there by<br>
 extra zeal against the Christians. It is possible that Luke<br>
 obtained his information about this incident from John Mark for<br>
 at his Mother's house the disciples gathered <b><i>(<!-#-->12:12)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:4 <B>{When he had taken him}</B> <b><i>(\piasas\)</i></b>. See on &#175;3:7 for same<br>
 form. <B>{He put him in prison}</B> <b><i>(\etheto eis phulak&#275;n\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist middle indicative of \tith&#275;mi\, common verb. This is the<br>
 third imprisonment of Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->4:3; 5:18)</i></b>. <B>{To four quaternions<br>
 of soldiers}</B> <b><i>(\tessarsin tetradiois strati&#333;t&#333;n\)</i></b>. Four soldiers<br>
 in each quaternion <b><i>(\tetradion\ from \tetras\, four)</i></b>, two on the<br>
 inside with the prisoner <b><i>(chained to him)</i></b> and two on the outside,<br>
 in shifts of six hours each, sixteen soldiers in all, the usual<br>
 Roman custom. Probably Agrippa had heard of Peter's previous<br>
 escape <b><i>(<!-#-->5:19)</i></b> and so took no chances for connivance of the<br>
 jailors. <B>{After the passover}</B> <b><i>(\meta to pascha\)</i></b>. The passover<br>
 feast of eight days. "The stricter Jews regarded it as a<br>
 profanation to put a person to death during a religious festival"<br>
 <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>. So Agrippa is more scrupulous than the Sanhedrin was<br>
 about Jesus. <B>{To bring him forth}</B> <b><i>(\anagagein auton\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active infinitive of \anag&#333;\, to lead up, old verb, used<br>
 literally here. Peter was in the inner prison or lower ward and<br>
 so would be led up to the judgment seat where Herod Agrippa would<br>
 sit <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Joh 19:13)</i></b>. <B>{To the people}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i la&#333;i\)</i></b>. Ethical<br>
 dative, in the presence of and for the pleasure of the Jewish<br>
 people.<br>
 <br>
 12:5 <B>{Therefore}</B> <b><i>(\men oun\)</i></b>. Because of the preceding situation.<br>
 <B>{Was kept}</B> <b><i>(\et&#275;reito\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive, continuously guarded,<br>
 waiting for the feast to be over. <B>{But prayer was made earnestly}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\proseuch&#275; de &#275;n ekten&#333;s ginomen&#275;\)</i></b>. Probably \de\ here is not<br>
 adversative <b><i>(but)</i></b>, merely parallel <b><i>(and)</i></b> as Page argues. It was a<br>
 crisis for the Jerusalem church. James had been slain and Peter<br>
 was to be the next victim. Hence "earnestly" <b><i>(late adverb from<br>
 \ekten&#275;s\, strained, from \ektein&#333;\, to stretch. In the N.T. only<br>
 here, <!-#-->Lu 22:44; 1Pe 1:22)</i></b> prayer was <B>{going up}</B> <b><i>(\ginomen&#275;\,<br>
 present middle participle, periphrastic imperfect with \&#275;n\)</i></b>. It<br>
 looked like a desperate case for Peter. Hence the disciples<br>
 prayed the more earnestly.<br>
 <br>
 12:6 <B>{Was about to bring him forth}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;mellen prosagagein\ or<br>
 \proagagein\)</i></b>. The MSS. vary, but not \anagagein\ of verse <!-#-->4.<br>
 <B>{The same night}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i nukti ekein&#275;i\)</i></b>. Locative case, <B>{on that<br>
 <b><i>(very)</i></b> night}</B>. <B>{Was sleeping}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n koim&#333;menos\)</i></b>. Periphrastic<br>
 middle imperfect. <B>{Bound with two chains}</B> <b><i>(\dedemenos halusesin<br>
 dusin\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of \de&#333;\, to bind, followed<br>
 by instrumental case. One chain was fastened to each soldier <b><i>(one<br>
 on each side of Peter)</i></b>. <B>{Kept}</B> <b><i>(\et&#275;roun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active,<br>
 were keeping. Two guards outside before the door and two inside,<br>
 according to Roman rule. Did Peter recall the prophecy of Jesus<br>
 that he should be put to death in his old age <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 21:18)</i></b>?<br>
 Jesus had not said, as Furneaux does, that he would die by<br>
 crucifixion.<br>
 <br>
 12:7 <B>{Stood by him}</B> <b><i>(\epest&#275;\)</i></b>. Ingressive second aorist active<br>
 indicative of \ephist&#275;mi\, intransitive. This very form occurs in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 2:9 of the sudden appearance of the angel of the Lord to the<br>
 shepherds. Page notes that this second aorist of \ephist&#275;mi\<br>
 occurs seven times in the Gospel of Luke, eight times in the<br>
 Acts, and nowhere else in the N.T. Note also the same form<br>
 \apest&#275;\ <b><i>(departed from, from \aphist&#275;mi\, stood off from)</i></b> of the<br>
 disappearance of the angel in verse <!-#-->10. <B>{In the cell}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i<br>
 oik&#275;mati\)</i></b>. Literally, a dwelling place or habitation <b><i>(from<br>
 \oike&#333;\, to dwell, \oikos\, house)</i></b>, but here not the prison as a<br>
 whole as in Thucydides, but the room in the prison <b><i>(cell)</i></b> where<br>
 Peter was chained to the two guards. Old word, but only here in<br>
 the N.T. <B>{He smote Peter on the side}</B> <b><i>(\pataxas t&#275;n pleuran tou<br>
 Petrou\)</i></b>. More exactly, "smote the side of Peter." Strongly<br>
 enough to wake Peter up who was sound asleep and yet not rouse<br>
 the two guards. It was probably between 3 A.M. and 6 A.M., hours<br>
 when changes in the guards were made. <B>{Rise up}</B> <b><i>(\anasta\)</i></b>. Short<br>
 form <b><i>(_Koin&#275;_)</i></b> of \anast&#275;thi\, second aorist active imperative of<br>
 \anist&#275;mi\, intransitive. So also <!-#-->Ac 9:11 <b><i>(Westcott and Hort<br>
 text)</i></b>; <!-#-->Eph 5:14. <B>{Fell off}</B> <b><i>(\exepesan\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 with \a\ ending like first aorist of \expipt&#333;\, old verb. This<br>
 miracle was necessary if Peter was to escape without rousing the<br>
 two guards.<br>
 <br>
 12:8 <B>{Gird thyself}</B> <b><i>(\z&#333;sai\)</i></b>. Direct middle first aorist<br>
 <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> imperative <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 806f.)</i></b> from<br>
 \z&#333;nnumi\ <b><i>(\z&#333;nnu&#333;\)</i></b>. Old verb, but in the N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->Joh 21:18 <b><i>(twice to Peter)</i></b> where the active voice and the<br>
 reflexive pronoun occur in the first example. The girdle was worn<br>
 round the \chit&#333;n\ or undergarment. <B>{Bind on}</B> <b><i>(\hupod&#275;sai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Indirect middle <b><i>(by yourself or for yourself)</i></b> first aorist<br>
 imperative of \hupode&#333;\, to bind under, old verb, only three<br>
 times in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 6:9; Ac 12:8; Eph 6:15 <b><i>(middle)</i></b>)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Sandals}</B> <b><i>(\sandalia\)</i></b>. Persian word common from Herodotus on, a<br>
 sole made of wood or leather covering the bottom of the foot and<br>
 bound on with thongs. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mr 6:9. In the<br>
 LXX used indiscriminately with \hupod&#275;ma\. <B>{Cast about thee}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\peribalou\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle <b><i>(indirect)</i></b> imperative of<br>
 \periball&#333;\, old and common verb to throw around, especially<br>
 clothing around the body as here. The \himation\ <b><i>(outer garment)</i></b><br>
 was put over the \chit&#333;n\. It was not a hurried flight. <B>{Follow<br>
 me}</B> <b><i>(\akolouthei moi\)</i></b>. Present <b><i>(linear)</i></b> active imperative, keep<br>
 on following me <b><i>(associative instrumental case)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:9 <B>{Wist not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk &#275;idei\)</i></b>. Past perfect of \oida\ used as<br>
 imperfect, did not know. <B>{Followed}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kolouthei\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active, kept on following as the angel had directed <b><i>(verse <!-#-->8)</i></b>.<br>
 That it was true <b><i>(\hoti al&#275;thes estin\)</i></b>. Indirect assertion and<br>
 so present tense retained. Note "true" <b><i>(\al&#275;thes\)</i></b> in the sense<br>
 of reality or actuality. <B>{Which was done}</B> <b><i>(\to ginomenon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present middle participle, that which was happening. <B>{Thought he<br>
 saw a vision}</B> <b><i>(\edokei horama blepein\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, kept<br>
 on thinking, puzzled as he was. \Blepein\ is the infinitive in<br>
 indirect assertion without the pronoun <b><i>(he)</i></b> expressed which could<br>
 be either nominative in apposition with the subject as in <!-#-->Ro<br>
 1:22 or accusative of general reference as in <!-#-->Ac 5:36; 8:9<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 1036-40)</i></b>. Peter had had a vision in<br>
 Joppa <b><i>(<!-#-->10:10)</i></b> which Luke describes as an "ecstasy," but here is<br>
 objective fact, at least Luke thought so and makes that<br>
 distinction. Peter will soon know whether he is still in the cell<br>
 or not as we find out that a dream is only a dream when we wake<br>
 up.<br>
 <br>
 12:10 <B>{When they were past}</B> <b><i>(\dielthontes\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \dierchomai\, transitive with \dia\ in composition.<br>
 <B>{The first and the second ward}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;t&#275;n phulak&#275;n kai deuteran\)</i></b>.<br>
 It is not clear to what this language refers. Some take it to<br>
 mean single soldiers, using \phulak&#275;n\ in the sense of a guard<br>
 <b><i>(one before the door, one at the iron gate)</i></b>. But it seems hardly<br>
 likely that the two soldiers with whom Peter had been stationed<br>
 are meant. Probably the "first ward" means the two soldiers of<br>
 the quaternion stationed by the door and the second ward some<br>
 other soldiers, not part of the sixteen, further on in the prison<br>
 by the iron gate. However understood, the difficulties of escape<br>
 are made plain. <B>{Unto the iron gate that leadeth into the city}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epi t&#275;n pul&#275;n t&#275;n sid&#275;r&#257;n t&#275;n pherousan eis t&#275;n polin\)</i></b>. Note<br>
 the triple use of the article <b><i>(the gate the iron one the one<br>
 leading into the city)</i></b>. For this resumptive use of the article<br>
 see Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 762, 764. This iron gate may have<br>
 opened from a court out into the street and effectually barred<br>
 escape. <B>{Opened to them}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;noig&#275; autois\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive<br>
 indicative of \anoig&#333;\, the usual later form though \&#275;noichth&#275;\<br>
 <b><i>(first aorist passive)</i></b> occurs also, was opened. <B>{Of its own<br>
 accord}</B> <b><i>(\automat&#275;\)</i></b>. Old compound adjective <b><i>(\autos\, self,<br>
 obsolete \ma&#333;\, to desire eagerly, feminine form though masculine<br>
 \automatos\ also used as feminine)</i></b>. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mr<br>
 4:28. It was a strange experience for Peter. The Codex Bezae<br>
 adds here "went down the seven steps" <b><i>(\kateb&#275;san tous hepta<br>
 bathmous\)</i></b>, an interesting detail that adds to the picture. <B>{One<br>
 street}</B> <b><i>(\rhum&#275;n mian\)</i></b>. The angel saw Peter through one of the<br>
 narrow streets and then left him. We have no means of knowing<br>
 precisely the location of the prison in the city. On "departed"<br>
 <b><i>(\apest&#275;\)</i></b> see on verse &#175;7.<br>
 <br>
 12:11 <B>{Was come to himself}</B> <b><i>(\en heaut&#333;i genomenos\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist middle participle of \ginomai\ with \en\ and the locative<br>
 case, "becoming at himself." In <!-#-->Lu 15:17 we have \eis heauton<br>
 elth&#333;n\ <b><i>(coming to himself, as if he had been on a trip away from<br>
 himself)</i></b>. <B>{Now I know of a truth}</B> <b><i>(\nun oida al&#275;th&#333;s\)</i></b>. There was<br>
 no further confusion of mind that it was an ecstasy as in<br>
 <!-#-->10:10. But he was in peril for the soldiers would soon learn of<br>
 his escape, when the change of guards came at 6 A.M. <B>{Delivered<br>
 me}</B> <b><i>(\exeilato me\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle indicative of<br>
 \exaire&#333;\. The Lord rescued me of himself by his angel.<br>
 <B>{Expectation}</B> <b><i>(\prosdokias\)</i></b>. Old word from \prosdoka&#333;\, to look<br>
 for. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 21:26. James had been put to<br>
 death and the Jewish people were eagerly waiting for the<br>
 execution of Peter like hungry wolves.<br>
 <br>
 12:12 <B>{When he had considered}</B> <b><i>(\sunid&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \suneidon\ <b><i>(for the defective verb \sunora&#333;\)</i></b>, to<br>
 see together, to grasp as a whole, old verb, but in the N.T. only<br>
 here and <!-#-->14:6, save the perfect indicative \sunoida\ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 4:4)</i></b> and participle <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 5:2)</i></b>. It is the word from which<br>
 \suneid&#275;sis\ <b><i>(conscience)</i></b> comes <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 2:15)</i></b>. Peter's mind worked<br>
 rapidly and he decided what to do. He took in his situation<br>
 clearly. <B>{To the house of Mary}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;n oikian t&#275;s Marias\)</i></b>.<br>
 Another Mary <b><i>(the others were Mary the mother of Jesus, Mary of<br>
 Bethany, Mary Magdalene, Mary wife of Cleopas, Mary the mother of<br>
 James and Joses)</i></b>. She may have been a widow and was possessed of<br>
 some means since her house was large enough to hold the large<br>
 group of disciples there. Barnabas, cousin of John Mark her son<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 4:10)</i></b>, was also a man of property or had been <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 4:36f.)</i></b>. It is probable that the disciples had been in the habit<br>
 of meeting in her house, a fact known to Peter and he was<br>
 evidently fond of John Mark whom he afterwards calls "my son"<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 5:13)</i></b> and whom he had met here. The upper room of <!-#-->Ac<br>
 1:13 may have been in Mary's house and Mark may have been the<br>
 man bearing a pitcher of water <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:10)</i></b> and the young man who<br>
 fled in the Garden of Gethsemane <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 14:51f.)</i></b>. There was a gate<br>
 and portress here as in the house of the highpriest <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 18:16)</i></b>. Peter knew where to go and even at this early hour hoped<br>
 to find some of the disciples. Mary is one of the many mothers<br>
 who have become famous by reason of their sons, though she was<br>
 undoubtedly a woman of high character herself. <B>{Were gathered<br>
 together and were praying}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san sun&#275;throismenoi kai<br>
 proseuchomenoi\)</i></b>. Note difference in the tenses, one periphrastic<br>
 past perfect passive <b><i>(\sunathroiz&#333;\ old verb, in the N.T. here<br>
 only and <!-#-->19:25 and the uncompounded \throiz&#333;\ in <!-#-->Lu 24:33)</i></b><br>
 and the periphrastic imperfect. The praying apparently had been<br>
 going on all night and a large number <b><i>(many, \hikanoi\)</i></b> of the<br>
 disciples were there. One recalls the time when they had gathered<br>
 to pray <b><i>(<!-#-->4:31)</i></b> after Peter had told the disciples of the<br>
 threats of the Sanhedrin <b><i>(<!-#-->4:23)</i></b>. God had rescued Peter then.<br>
 Would he let him be put to death now as James had been?<br>
 <br>
 12:13 <B>{When he knocked at the door of the gate}</B> <b><i>(\krousantos<br>
 autou t&#275;n thuran tou pul&#333;nos\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute with aorist<br>
 active participle of \krou&#333;\, common verb to knock or knock at.<br>
 So from the outside <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 13:25)</i></b>. \Pul&#333;n\ here is the gateway or<br>
 passageway from the door <b><i>(\thura\)</i></b> that leads to the house. In<br>
 verse <!-#-->14 it is still the passageway without the use of \thura\<br>
 <b><i>(door, so for both door and passageway)</i></b>. <B>{To answer}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hupakousai\)</i></b>. To listen under before opening. First aorist<br>
 active infinitive of \hupakou&#333;\, common verb to obey, to hearken.<br>
 <B>{A maid}</B> <b><i>(\paidisk&#275;\)</i></b>. Portress as in <!-#-->Joh 18:17. A diminutive<br>
 of \pais\, a female slave <b><i>(so on an ostracon of second century<br>
 A.D., Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient East_, p. 200)</i></b>. <B>{Rhoda}</B>.<br>
 A rose. Women can have such beautiful names like Dorcas<br>
 <b><i>(Gazelle)</i></b>, Euodia <b><i>(Sweet Aroma)</i></b>, Syntyche <b><i>(Good Luck)</i></b>. Mark or<br>
 Peter could tell Luke her name.<br>
 <br>
 12:14 <B>{When she knew}</B> <b><i>(\epignousa\)</i></b>. Second aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b><br>
 active participle of \epigin&#333;sk&#333;\, to know fully or in addition<br>
 <b><i>(\epi\)</i></b>, to recognize. She knew Peter and his voice from his<br>
 frequent visits there. <B>{For joy}</B> <b><i>(\apo t&#275;s char&#257;s\)</i></b>. From her joy<br>
 <b><i>(ablative case)</i></b>, life-like picture of the maid who left Peter<br>
 standing outside with the door to the passageway unopened. Note<br>
 the aorist tenses for quick action <b><i>(\ouk &#275;noixen\)</i></b>, \eisdramousa\<br>
 <b><i>(from \eistrech&#333;\, defective verb, only here in the N.T.)</i></b>,<br>
 \ap&#275;ggeilen\. <B>{Stood}</B> <b><i>(\hestanai\)</i></b>. Second perfect active<br>
 infinitive of \hist&#275;mi\, intransitive, in indirect assertion with<br>
 \ton Petron\ <b><i>(Peter)</i></b> accusative of general reference. The slave<br>
 girl acted as if she were a member of the family <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>, but<br>
 she left Peter in peril.<br>
 <br>
 12:15 <B>{Thou art mad}</B> <b><i>(\main&#275;i\)</i></b>. Present middle indicative second<br>
 person singular. Old verb, only in the middle voice. Festus used<br>
 the same word to Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->26:24)</i></b>. The maid was undoubtedly<br>
 excited, but it was a curious rebuff from those who had been<br>
 praying all night for Peter's release. In their defence it may be<br>
 said that Stephen and James had been put to death and many others<br>
 by Saul's persecution. <B>{She confidently affirmed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\diischurizeto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of \diischurizomai\, an old<br>
 word of vigorous and confident assertion, originally to lean<br>
 upon. Only here in the N.T. The girl stuck to her statement. <B>{It<br>
 is his angel}</B> <b><i>(\Ho aggelos estin autou\)</i></b>. This was the second<br>
 alternative of the disciples. It was a popular Jewish belief that<br>
 each man had a guardian angel. Luke takes no position about it.<br>
 No scripture teaches it.<br>
 <br>
 12:16 <B>{Continued knocking}</B> <b><i>(\epemenen krou&#333;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect active<br>
 and present participle. Now all heard the knocking. <B>{When they<br>
 had opened}</B> <b><i>(\anoixantes\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle of<br>
 \anoig&#333;\ or \-numi\. The whole group rushed out to the courtyard<br>
 this time to make sure. <B>{They were amazed}</B> <b><i>(\exest&#275;san\)</i></b>. The<br>
 frequent second aorist active <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b> indicative of<br>
 \exist&#275;mi\.<br>
 <br>
 12:17 There were probably loud exclamations of astonishment and<br>
 joy. <B>{Beckoning with the hand}</B> <b><i>(\kataseisas t&#275;i cheiri\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active participle of \katasei&#333;\, old verb to signal or<br>
 shake down with the hand <b><i>(instrumental case \cheiri\)</i></b>. In the<br>
 N.T. only in <!-#-->Ac 12:17; 13:16; 19:33; 21:40. The speaker<br>
 indicates by a downward movement of the hand his desire for<br>
 silence <b><i>(to hold their peace, \sig&#257;in\, present active<br>
 infinitive, to keep silent)</i></b>. Peter was anxious for every<br>
 precaution and he wanted their instant attention. <B>{Declared}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\di&#275;g&#275;sato\)</i></b>. First aorist middle of \di&#275;geomai\, old verb to<br>
 carry through a narrative, give a full story. See also <!-#-->Ac 9:27<br>
 of Barnabas in his defence of Saul. Peter told them the wonderful<br>
 story. <B>{Unto James and the brethren}</B> <b><i>(\Iak&#333;b&#333;i kai tois<br>
 adelphois\)</i></b>. Dative case after \apaggeilate\ <b><i>(first aorist active<br>
 imperative)</i></b>. Evidently "James and the brethren" were not at this<br>
 meeting, probably meeting elsewhere. There was no place where all<br>
 the thousands of disciples in Jerusalem could meet. This<br>
 gathering in the house of Mary may have been of women only or a<br>
 meeting of the Hellenists. It is plain that this James the Lord's<br>
 brother, is now the leading presbyter or elder in Jerusalem<br>
 though there were a number <b><i>(<!-#-->11:30; 21:18)</i></b>. Paul even terms him<br>
 apostle <b><i>(<!-#-->Gal 1:19)</i></b>, though certainly not one of the twelve. The<br>
 twelve apostles probably were engaged elsewhere in mission work<br>
 save James now dead <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 12:2)</i></b> and Peter. The leadership of<br>
 James is here recognized by Peter and is due, partly to the<br>
 absence of the twelve, but mainly to his own force of character.<br>
 He will preside over the Jerusalem Conference <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:13)</i></b>. <B>{To<br>
 another place}</B> <b><i>(\eis heteron topon\)</i></b>. Probably Luke did not know<br>
 the place and certainly it was prudent for Peter to conceal it<br>
 from Herod Agrippa. Probably Peter left the city. He is back in<br>
 Jerusalem at the Conference a few years later <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:7)</i></b> and<br>
 after the death of Herod Agrippa. Whether Peter went to Rome<br>
 during these years we do not know. He was recognized later as the<br>
 apostle to the circumcision <b><i>(<!-#-->Gal 2:7; 1Pe 1:1)</i></b> and apparently<br>
 was in Rome with John Mark when he wrote the First Epistle <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe<br>
 5:13)</i></b>, unless it is the real Babylon. But, even if Peter went to<br>
 Rome during this early period, there is no evidence that he<br>
 founded the church there. If he had done so, in the light of <!-#-->2Co<br>
 10:16 it would be strange that Paul had not mentioned it in<br>
 writing to Rome, for he was anxious not to build on another man's<br>
 foundation <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 15:20)</i></b>. Paul felt sure that he himself had a<br>
 work to do in Rome. Unfortunately Luke has not followed the<br>
 ministry of Peter after this period as he does Paul <b><i>(appearing<br>
 again only in chapter <!-#-->Ac 15)</i></b>. If Peter really left Jerusalem at<br>
 this time instead of hiding in the city, he probably did some<br>
 mission work as Paul says that he did <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 9:5)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:18 <B>{As soon as it was day}</B> <b><i>(\Genomen&#275;s h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute, day having come. <B>{No small stir}</B> <b><i>(\tarachos ouk<br>
 oligos\)</i></b>. Litotes <b><i>(\ouk oligos\)</i></b>, occurs eight times in the Acts<br>
 as in <!-#-->15:2, and nowhere else in the N.T. \Tarachos\ <b><i>(stir)</i></b> is<br>
 an old word from \tarass&#333;\, to agitate. In the N.T only here and<br>
 <!-#-->19:23. Probably all sixteen soldiers were agitated over this<br>
 remarkable escape. They were responsible for the prisoner with<br>
 their lives <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ac 16:27; 27:42)</i></b>. Furneaux suggests that<br>
 Manaen, the king's foster-brother and a Christian <b><i>(<!-#-->13:1)</i></b>, was<br>
 the "angel" who rescued Peter from the prison. That is not the<br>
 way that Peter looked at it. <B>{What was become of Peter}</B> <b><i>(\ti ara<br>
 ho Petros egeneto\)</i></b>. An indirect question with the aorist<br>
 indicative retained. \Ara\ adds a syllogism <b><i>(therefore)</i></b> to the<br>
 problem as in <!-#-->Lu 1:66. The use of the neuter \ti\ <b><i>(as in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 13:25)</i></b> is different from \tis\, though nominative like \Petros\,<br>
 literally, "what then Peter had become," "what had happened to<br>
 Peter" <b><i>(in one idiom)</i></b>. See the same idiom in <!-#-->Joh 21:21 <b><i>(\houtos<br>
 de ti\)</i></b>. <B>{But this one what}</B> <b><i>(verb \gen&#275;setai\ not used)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:19 <B>{He examined}</B> <b><i>(\anakrinas\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle<br>
 of \anakrin&#333;\, old verb to sift up and down, to question<br>
 thoroughly, in a forensic sense <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:14; Ac 4:9; 12:19;<br>
 28:18)</i></b>. <B>{That they should be put to death}</B> <b><i>(\apachth&#275;nai\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive infinitive <b><i>(indirect command)</i></b> of \apag&#333;\,<br>
 old verb to lead away, especially to execution as in <!-#-->Mt 27:31.<br>
 Here it is used absolutely. This was the ordinary Roman routine<br>
 and not a proof of special cruelty on the part of Herod Agrippa.<br>
 <B>{Tarried}</B> <b><i>(\dietriben\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. Herod Agrippa made his<br>
 home in Jerusalem, but he went to Caesarea to the public games in<br>
 honour of Emperor Claudius.<br>
 <br>
 12:20 <B>{Was highly displeased}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n thumomach&#333;n\)</i></b>. Periphrastic<br>
 imperfect active of \thumomache&#333;\, late compound of \thumos\<br>
 <b><i>(passionate heat)</i></b> and \machomai\, to fight. Only here in the<br>
 N.T., to fight desperately, to have a hot quarrel. Whether it was<br>
 open war with the Phoenicians or just violent hostility we do not<br>
 know, save that Phoenicia belonged to Syria and Herod Agrippa had<br>
 no authority there. The quarrel may have been over commercial<br>
 matters. <B>{They came with one accord}</B> <b><i>(\homothumadon par&#275;san\)</i></b>.<br>
 The representatives of Tyre and Sidon. See on &#175;1:14 for<br>
 \homothumadon\. Tyre was a colony of Sidon and had become one of<br>
 the chief commercial cities of the world by reason of the<br>
 Phoenician ships. <B>{The king's chamberlain}</B> <b><i>(\ton epi tou koit&#333;nos<br>
 tou basileos\)</i></b>. The one over the bedchamber <b><i>(\koit&#333;nos\, late<br>
 word from \koit&#275;\, bed, here only in the N.T.)</i></b>. <B>{Made their<br>
 friend}</B> <b><i>(\peisantes\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle of<br>
 \peith&#333;\, to persuade. Having persuaded <b><i>(probably with bribes as<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 28:14)</i></b>. <B>{They asked for peace}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;itounto eir&#275;n&#275;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect middle of \aite&#333;\, kept on asking for peace. <B>{Because<br>
 their country was fed}</B> <b><i>(\dia to trephesthai aut&#333;n t&#275;n choran\)</i></b>.<br>
 Causal sentence with \dia\ and the articular infinitive <b><i>(present<br>
 passive of \treph&#333;\, to nourish or feed)</i></b> and the accusative of<br>
 general reference, "because of the being fed as to their<br>
 country." Tyre and Sidon as large commercial cities on the coast<br>
 received large supplies of grain and fruits from Palestine. Herod<br>
 had cut off the supplies and that brought the two cities to<br>
 action.<br>
 <br>
 12:21 <B>{Upon a set day}</B> <b><i>(\takt&#275;i h&#275;mer&#257;i\)</i></b>. Locative case and the<br>
 verbal adjective of \tass&#333;\, to arrange, appoint, old word, here<br>
 only in the N.T. Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. XVII. 6, 8; XIX. 8, 2)</i></b> gives a<br>
 full account of the occasion and the death of Herod Agrippa. It<br>
 was the second day of the festival in honour of the Emperor<br>
 Claudius, possibly his birthday rather than the _Quinquennalia_.<br>
 The two accounts of Luke and Josephus supplement each other with<br>
 no contradiction. Josephus does not mention the name of Blastus.<br>
 <B>{Arrayed himself in royal apparel}</B> <b><i>(\endusamenos esth&#275;ta<br>
 basilik&#275;n\)</i></b>. First aorist middle <b><i>(indirect)</i></b> participle of<br>
 \endun&#333;\ or \endu&#333;\, common verb to put on. Literally, having put<br>
 royal apparel on himself <b><i>(a robe of silver tissue, Josephus<br>
 says)</i></b>. The rays of the sun shone on this brilliant apparel and<br>
 the vast crowd in the open amphitheatre became excited as Herod<br>
 began to speak. <B>{Made an oration}</B> <b><i>(\ed&#275;m&#275;gorei\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active of \d&#275;m&#275;gore&#333;\, old verb from \d&#275;m&#275;goros\ <b><i>(haranguer of<br>
 the people)</i></b>, and that from \d&#275;mos\ <b><i>(people)</i></b> and \agoreu&#333;\, to<br>
 harangue or address the people. Only here in the N.T. He kept it<br>
 up.<br>
 <br>
 12:22 <B>{Shouted}</B> <b><i>(\epeph&#333;nei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, kept on<br>
 shouting, calling out to him. Old verb, but only four times in<br>
 the N.T. and all by Luke. The heathen crowd <b><i>(\d&#275;mos\)</i></b> repeated<br>
 their flattering adulation to gain Herod's favour. <B>{The voice of<br>
 a god}</B> <b><i>(\theou ph&#333;n&#275;\)</i></b>. In the pagan sense of emperor worship,<br>
 not as the Supreme Being. But it was pleasing to Herod Agrippa's<br>
 vanity.<br>
 <br>
 12:23 <B>{Smote him}</B> <b><i>(\epataxen auton\)</i></b>. Effective aorist active<br>
 indicative of \patass&#333;\, old verb, used already in verse <!-#-->7 of<br>
 gentle smiting of the angel of the Lord, here of a severe stroke<br>
 of affliction. Like Nebuchadnezzar <b><i>(<!-#-->Da 4:30)</i></b> pride went before<br>
 a fall. He was struck down in the very zenith of his glory.<br>
 <B>{Because}</B> <b><i>(\anth' h&#333;n\)</i></b>. \Anti\ with the genitive of the relative<br>
 pronoun, "in return for which things." He accepted the impious<br>
 flattery <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b> instead of giving God the glory. He was a<br>
 nominal Jew. <B>{He was eaten of worms}</B> <b><i>(\genomenos sk&#333;l&#275;kobr&#333;tos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Ingressive aorist middle participle, "becoming worm-eaten." The<br>
 compound verbal adjective <b><i>(\sk&#333;l&#275;x\, worm, \br&#333;tos\, eaten, from<br>
 \bibr&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b> is a late word <b><i>(II Macc. 9:9)</i></b> of the death of<br>
 Antiochus Epiphanes, used also of a tree <b><i>(Theophrastus)</i></b>, here<br>
 only in the N.T. The word \sk&#333;l&#275;x\ was used of intestinal worms<br>
 and Herodotus <b><i>(IV. 205)</i></b> describes Pheretima, Queen of Cyrene, as<br>
 having swarms of worms which ate her flesh while still alive.<br>
 Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. XIX. 8, 2)</i></b> says that Herod Agrippa lingered for<br>
 five days and says that the rotting of his flesh produced worms,<br>
 an item in harmony with the narrative in Luke. Josephus gives<br>
 further details, one a superstitious sight of an owl sitting on<br>
 one of the ropes of the awning of the theatre while the people<br>
 flattered him, an omen of his death to him. Luke puts it simply<br>
 that God smote him. <B>{Gave up the ghost}</B> <b><i>(\exepsuxen\)</i></b>. Effective<br>
 aorist active of \ekpsuch&#333;\, to breathe out, late verb, medical<br>
 term in Hippocrates, in the N.T. only in <!-#-->Ac 5:5,10; 12:23.<br>
 Herod was carried out of the theatre a dying man and lingered<br>
 only five days.<br>
 <br>
 12:24 <B>{Grew and multiplied}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;uxanen kai epl&#275;thuneto\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active and passive. Cf. <!-#-->6:1. The reaction from the<br>
 death of James and the imprisonment of Peter.<br>
 <br>
 12:25 <B>{From Jerusalem}</B> <b><i>(\ex Ierousal&#275;m\)</i></b>. Probably correct text,<br>
 though D has \apo\. Westcott and Hort follow Aleph B in reading<br>
 \eis\ <b><i>(to)</i></b> Jerusalem, an impossible reading contradicted by<br>
 <!-#-->11:29f.; 13:1. The ministration <b><i>(\diakonian\)</i></b> referred to is<br>
 that in <!-#-->11:29f. which may have taken place, in point of time,<br>
 after the death of Herod. <B>{Taking with them}</B> <b><i>(\sunparalabontes\)</i></b>.<br>
 Taking along <b><i>(\para\)</i></b> with <b><i>(\sun\)</i></b> them, John Mark from Jerusalem<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->12:12)</i></b> to Antioch <b><i>(<!-#-->13:1)</i></b>. The aorist participle does not<br>
 express subsequent action as Rackham here argues <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, pp. 861-863)</i></b>.<br>
