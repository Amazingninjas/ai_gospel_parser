<p>13:1 <B>{At that very season}</B> <b><i>(\en aut&#333;i t&#333;i kair&#333;i\)</i></b>. Luke's<br>
 frequent idiom, "at the season itself." Apparently in close<br>
 connexion with the preceding discourses. Probably "were present"<br>
 <b><i>(\par&#275;san\, imperfect of \pareimi\)</i></b> means "came," "stepped to his<br>
 side," as often <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 26:50; Ac 12:20; Joh 11:28)</i></b>. These people<br>
 had a piece of news for Jesus. <B>{Whose blood Pilate had mingled<br>
 with their sacrifices}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;n to haima Peilatos emixen meta t&#333;n<br>
 thusi&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. The verb \emixen\ is first aorist active <b><i>(not<br>
 past perfect)</i></b> of \mignumi\, a common verb. The incident is<br>
 recorded nowhere else, but is in entire harmony with Pilate's<br>
 record for outrages. These Galileans at a feast in Jerusalem may<br>
 have been involved in some insurrection against the Roman<br>
 government, the leaders of whom Pilate had slain right in the<br>
 temple courts where the sacrifices were going on. Jesus comments<br>
 on the incident, but not as the reporters had expected. Instead<br>
 of denunciation of Pilate he turned it into a parable for their<br>
 own conduct in the uncertainty of life.<br>
 <br>
 13:2 <B>{Sinners above all}</B> <b><i>(\hamart&#333;loi para pantas\)</i></b>. \Para\ means<br>
 "beside," placed beside all the Galileans, and so beyond or above<br>
 <b><i>(with the accusative)</i></b>. <B>{Have suffered}</B> <b><i>(\peponthasin\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 perfect active indicative third plural from \pasch&#333;\, common<br>
 verb, to experience, suffer. The tense notes that it is "an<br>
 irrevocable fact" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:3 <B>{Except ye repent}</B> <b><i>(\ean m&#275; metano&#275;te\)</i></b>. Present active<br>
 subjunctive of \metanoe&#333;\, to change mind and conduct, linear<br>
 action, keep on changing. Condition of third class, undetermined,<br>
 but with prospect of determination. <B>{Ye shall perish}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\apoleisthe\)</i></b>. Future middle indicative of \apollumi\ and<br>
 intransitive. Common verb.<br>
 <br>
 13:4 <B>{The tower in Siloam}</B> <b><i>(\ho purgos en Sil&#333;am\)</i></b>. Few sites<br>
 have been more clearly located than this. Jesus mentions this<br>
 accident <b><i>(only in Luke)</i></b> of his own accord to illustrate still<br>
 further the responsibility of his hearers. Jesus makes use of<br>
 public events in both these incidents to teach spiritual lessons.<br>
 He gives the "moral" to the massacre of the Galilean pilgrims and<br>
 the "moral" of the catastrophe at Siloam. <B>{Offenders}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\opheiletai\)</i></b>. Literally, <B>{debtors}</B>, not sinners as in verse <!-#-->2<br>
 and as the Authorized Version renders here. See <!-#-->7:41; 11:4; Mt<br>
 6:12; 18:24-34.<br>
 <br>
 13:5 <B>{Except ye repent}</B> <b><i>(\ean m&#275; metano&#275;s&#275;te\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active subjunctive, immediate repentance in contrast to continued<br>
 repentance, \metano&#275;te\ in verse <!-#-->3, though Westcott and Hort<br>
 put \metano&#275;te\ in the margin here. The interpretation of<br>
 accidents is a difficult matter, but the moral pointed out by<br>
 Jesus is obvious.<br>
 <br>
 13:6 <B>{Planted}</B> <b><i>(\pephuteumen&#275;n\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of<br>
 \phuteu&#333;\, to plant, an old verb, from \phuton\, a plant, and<br>
 that from \phu&#333;\, to grow. But this participle with \eichen\<br>
 <b><i>(imperfect active of \ech&#333;\)</i></b> does not make a periphrastic past<br>
 perfect like our English "had planted." It means rather, he had a<br>
 fig tree, one already planted in his vineyard.<br>
 <br>
 13:7 <B>{The vinedresser}</B> <b><i>(\ton ampelourgon\)</i></b>. Old word, but here<br>
 only in the N.T., from \ampelos\, vine, and \ergon\, work. <B>{These<br>
 three years I come}</B> <b><i>(\tria et&#275; aph' hou erchomai\)</i></b>. Literally,<br>
 "three years since <b><i>(from which time)</i></b> I come." These three years,<br>
 of course, have nothing to do with the three years of Christ's<br>
 public ministry. The three years are counted from the time when<br>
 the fig tree would normally be expected to bear, not from the<br>
 time of planting. The Jewish nation is meant by this parable of<br>
 the barren fig tree. In the withering of the barren fig tree<br>
 later at Jerusalem we see parable changed to object lesson or<br>
 fact <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 11:12-14; Mt 21:18f.)</i></b>. <B>{Cut it down}</B> <b><i>(\ekkopson\)</i></b>.<br>
 "Cut it out," the Greek has it, out of the vineyard, perfective<br>
 use of \ek\ with the effective aorist active imperative of<br>
 \kopt&#333;\, where we prefer "down." <B>{Why?}</B> <b><i>(\hina ti\)</i></b>. Ellipsis<br>
 here of \gen&#275;tai\ of which \ti\ is subject <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_,<br>
 pp. 739,916)</i></b>. <B>{Also}</B> <b><i>(\kai\)</i></b>. Besides bearing no fruit. <B>{Doth<br>
 cumber the ground}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n g&#275;n katargei\)</i></b>. Makes the ground<br>
 completely idle, of no use <b><i>(\kata, arge&#333;\, from \argos\, \a\<br>
 privative and \ergon\, work)</i></b>. Late verb, here only in the N.T.<br>
 except in Paul's Epistles.<br>
 <br>
 13:8 <B>{Till I shall dig}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s hotou skaps&#333;\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active subjunctive like \bal&#333;\ <b><i>(second aorist active subjunctive<br>
 of \ball&#333;\)</i></b>, both common verbs. <B>{Dung it}</B> <b><i>(\bal&#333; kopria\)</i></b>. Cast<br>
 dung around it, manure it. \Kopria\, late word, here alone in the<br>
 N.T.<br>
 <br>
 13:9 <B>{And if it bear fruit thenceforth}</B> <b><i>(\k'an men poi&#275;s&#275;i karpon<br>
 eis to mellon\)</i></b>. Aposiopesis, sudden breaking off for effect<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1203)</i></b>. See it also in <!-#-->Mr 11:32; Ac<br>
 23:9. Trench <b><i>(_Parables_)</i></b> tells a story like this of<br>
 intercession for the fig tree for one year more which is widely<br>
 current among the Arabs today who say that it will certainly bear<br>
 fruit this time.<br>
 <br>
 13:10 <B>{He was teaching}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n didask&#333;n\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect<br>
 active.<br>
 <br>
 13:11 <B>{A spirit of infirmity}</B> <b><i>(\pneuma astheneias\)</i></b>. A spirit<br>
 that caused the weakness <b><i>(\astheneias\, lack of strength)</i></b> like a<br>
 spirit of bondage <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 8:15)</i></b>, genitive case. <B>{She was bowed<br>
 together}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n sunkuptousa\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect active of<br>
 \sunkupt&#333;\, old verb, here only in the N.T., to bend together,<br>
 medical word for curvature of the spine. <B>{And could in no wise<br>
 lift herself up}</B> <b><i>(\kai m&#275; dunamen&#275; anakupsai eis to panteles\)</i></b>.<br>
 Negative form of the previous statement. \Anakupsai\, first<br>
 aorist active infinitive of \anakupt&#333;\ <b><i>(\ana, kupt&#333;\, same verb<br>
 above compounded with \sun\)</i></b>. Unable to bend herself up or back<br>
 at all <b><i>(\eis to panteles\, wholly as in <!-#-->Heb 7:25 only other<br>
 passage in the N.T. where it occurs)</i></b>. The poor old woman had to<br>
 come in all bent over.<br>
 <br>
 13:12 <B>{He called her}</B> <b><i>(\proseph&#333;n&#275;sen\)</i></b>. To come to him <b><i>(\pros\)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Thou art loosed}</B> <b><i>(\apolelusai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative of<br>
 \apolu&#333;\, common verb, loosed to stay free. Only N.T. example of<br>
 use about disease.<br>
 <br>
 13:13 <B>{He laid his hands upon her}</B> <b><i>(\epeth&#275;ken aut&#275;i tas<br>
 cheiras\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of \epitith&#275;mi\. As the<br>
 Great Physician with gentle kindness. <B>{She was made straight}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\an&#333;rth&#333;th&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b> passive indicative of<br>
 \anortho&#333;\, old verb, but only three times in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 13:13; Heb 12:12; Ac 15:16)</i></b>, to make straight again. Here it has<br>
 the literal sense of making straight the old woman's crooked<br>
 back. <B>{She glorified God}</B> <b><i>(\edoxazen ton theon\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active. Began it <b><i>(inchoative)</i></b> and kept it up.<br>
 <br>
 13:14 <B>{Answered}</B> <b><i>(\apokritheis\)</i></b>. First aorist passive participle<br>
 of \apokrinomai\. No one had spoken to him, but he felt his<br>
 importance as the ruler of the synagogue and was indignant<br>
 <b><i>(\aganakt&#333;n\, from \agan\ and \achomai\, to feel much pain)</i></b>. His<br>
 words have a ludicrous sound as if all the people had to do to<br>
 get their crooked backs straightened out was to come round to his<br>
 synagogue during the week. He forgot that this poor old woman had<br>
 been coming for eighteen years with no result. He was angry with<br>
 Jesus, but he spoke to the multitude <b><i>(\t&#333;i ochl&#333;i\)</i></b>. <B>{Ought}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dei\)</i></b>. Really, must, necessary, a direct hit at Jesus who had<br>
 "worked" on the sabbath in healing this old woman. <B>{And not}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai m&#275;\)</i></b>. Instead of \kai ou\, because in the imperative<br>
 clause.<br>
 <br>
 13:15 <B>{The Lord answered him}</B> <b><i>(\apekrith&#275; de aut&#333;i ho Kurios\)</i></b>.<br>
 Note use of "the Lord" of Jesus again in Luke's narrative. Jesus<br>
 answered the ruler of the synagogue who had spoken to the crowd,<br>
 but about Jesus. It was a crushing and overwhelming reply.<br>
 <B>{Hypocrites}</B> <b><i>(\hupokritai\)</i></b>. This pretentious faultfinder and all<br>
 who agree with him. <B>{Each of you}</B> <b><i>(\hekastos hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. An<br>
 _argumentum ad hominen_. These very critics of Jesus cared too<br>
 much for an ox or an ass to leave it all the sabbath without<br>
 water. <B>{Stall}</B> <b><i>(\phatn&#275;s\)</i></b>. Old word, in the N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 2:7,12,16 the manger where the infant Jesus was placed. <B>{To<br>
 watering}</B> <b><i>(\potizei\)</i></b>. Old verb, causative, to give to drink.<br>
 <br>
 13:16 <B>{Daughter of Abraham}</B> <b><i>(\thugatera Abraam\)</i></b>. Triple<br>
 argument, human being and not an ox or ass, woman, daughter of<br>
 Abraham <b><i>(Jewess)</i></b>, besides being old and ill. <B>{Ought not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk<br>
 edei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. Of necessity. Jesus simply had to heal<br>
 her even if on the sabbath. <B>{Whom S&#257;tan bound}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;n ed&#275;sen ho<br>
 Satanas\)</i></b>. Definite statement that her disease was due to Satan.<br>
 <br>
 13:17 <B>{Were put to shame}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;ischunonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive<br>
 of \kataischun&#333;\, old verb, to make ashamed, make one feel<br>
 ashamed. Passive here, to blush with shame at their predicament.<br>
 <B>{Rejoiced}</B> <b><i>(\echairen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. Sharp contrast in the<br>
 emotions of the two groups. <B>{Were done}</B> <b><i>(\ginomenois\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 middle participle, were continually being done.<br>
 <br>
 13:18 <B>{He said therefore}</B> <b><i>(\elegen oun\)</i></b>. It is not clear to what<br>
 to refer "therefore," whether to the case of the woman in verse<br>
 <!-#-->11, the enthusiasm of the crowd in verse <!-#-->17, or to something<br>
 not recorded by Luke.<br>
 <br>
 13:19 <B>{A grain of mustard seed}</B> <b><i>(\kokk&#333;i sinape&#333;s\)</i></b>. Either the<br>
 _sinapis nigra_ or the _salvadora persica_, both of which have<br>
 small seeds and grow to twelve feet at times. The Jews had a<br>
 proverb: "Small as a mustard seed." Given by <!-#-->Mr 4:30-32; Mt<br>
 13:31f. in the first great group of parables, but just the sort<br>
 to be repeated. <B>{Cast into his own garden}</B> <b><i>(\ebalen eis k&#275;pon<br>
 heautou\)</i></b>. Different from "earth" <b><i>(Mark)</i></b> or "field" <b><i>(Matthew.)</i></b>"<br>
 \K&#275;pos\, old word for garden, only here in the N.T. and <!-#-->Joh<br>
 19:1,26; 19:41. <B>{Became a tree}</B> <b><i>(\egeneto eis dendron\)</i></b>. Common<br>
 Hebraism, very frequent in LXX, only in Luke in the N.T., but<br>
 does appear in _Koin&#275;_ though rare in papyri; this use of \eis\<br>
 after words like _ginomai_. It is a translation Hebraism in Luke.<br>
 <B>{Lodged}</B> <b><i>(\katesk&#275;n&#333;sen\)</i></b>. Mark and Matthew have \katask&#275;noin\<br>
 infinitive of the same verb, to make tent <b><i>(or nest)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:20 <B>{Whereunto shall I liken?}</B> <b><i>(\Tini homoi&#333;s&#333;;\)</i></b>. This<br>
 question alone in Luke here as in verse <!-#-->18. But the parable is<br>
 precisely like that in <!-#-->Mt 13:33, which see for details.<br>
 <br>
 13:22 <B>{Journeying on unto Jerusalem}</B> <b><i>(\poreian poioumenos eis<br>
 Ierosoluma\)</i></b>. Making his way to Jerusalem. Note tenses here of<br>
 continued action, and distributive use of \kata\ with cities and<br>
 villages. This is the second of the journeys to Jerusalem in this<br>
 later ministry corresponding to that in <!-#-->Joh 11.<br>
 <br>
 13:23 <B>{Are they few that be saved?}</B> <b><i>(\ei oligoi hoi s&#333;zomenoi;\)</i></b>.<br>
 Note use of \ei\ as an interrogative which can be explained as<br>
 ellipsis or as \ei=&#275;\  <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1024)</i></b>. This was<br>
 an academic theological problem with the rabbis, the number of<br>
 the elect.<br>
 <br>
 13:24 <B>{Strive}</B> <b><i>(\ag&#333;nizesthe\)</i></b>. Jesus makes short shrift of the<br>
 question. He includes others <b><i>(present middle plural of<br>
 \ag&#333;nizomai\, common verb, our agonize)</i></b>. Originally it was to<br>
 contend for a prize in the games. The kindred word \ag&#333;nia\<br>
 occurs of Christ's struggle in Gethsemane <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:44)</i></b>. The<br>
 narrow gate appears also in <!-#-->Mt 7:13, only there it is an<br>
 outside gate <b><i>(\pul&#275;s\)</i></b> while here it is the entrance to the<br>
 house, "the narrow door" <b><i>(\thuras\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:25 <B>{When once}</B> <b><i>(\aph' hou an\)</i></b>. Possibly to be connected<br>
 without break with the preceding verse <b><i>(so Westcott and Hort)</i></b>,<br>
 though Bruce argues for two parables here, the former <b><i>(verse<br>
 <!-#-->24)</i></b> about being in earnest, while this one <b><i>(verses <!-#-->25-30)</i></b><br>
 about not being too late. The two points are here undoubtedly. It<br>
 is an awkward construction, \aph' hou = apo toutou hote\ with<br>
 \an\ and the aorist subjunctive <b><i>(\egerth&#275;i\ and \apokleis&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 See Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 978. <B>{Hath shut to}</B> <b><i>(\apokleis&#275;i\)</i></b>,<br>
 first aorist active subjunctive of \apoklei&#333;\, old verb, but only<br>
 here in the N.T. Note effective aorist tense and perfective use<br>
 of \apo\, slammed the door fast. <B>{And ye begin}</B> <b><i>(\kai arx&#275;sthe\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist middle subjunctive of \archomai\ with \aph' hou an\<br>
 like \egerth&#275;i\ and \apokleis&#275;i\. <B>{To stand}</B> <b><i>(\hestanai\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 perfect active infinitive of \hist&#275;mi\, intransitive tense <B>{and<br>
 to knock}</B> <b><i>(\kai krouein\)</i></b>. Present active infinitive, to keep on<br>
 knocking. <B>{Open to us}</B> <b><i>(\anoixon h&#275;min\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 imperative, at once and urgent. <B>{He shall say}</B> <b><i>(\erei\)</i></b>. Future<br>
 active of \eipon\ <b><i>(defective verb)</i></b>. This is probably the apodosis<br>
 of the \aph' hou\ clause.<br>
 <br>
 13:26 <B>{Shall ye begin}</B> <b><i>(\arxesthe\)</i></b>. Future middle, though<br>
 Westcott and Hort put \arx&#275;sthe\ <b><i>(aorist middle subjunctive of<br>
 \archomai\)</i></b> and in that case a continuation of the \aph' hou\<br>
 construction. It is a difficult passage and the copyists had<br>
 trouble with it. <B>{In thy presence}</B> <b><i>(\en&#333;pion sou\)</i></b>. As guests or<br>
 hosts or neighbours some claim, or the master of the house. It is<br>
 grotesque to claim credit because Christ taught in their streets,<br>
 but they are hard run for excuses and claims.<br>
 <br>
 13:27 <B>{I know not whence ye are}</B> <b><i>(\ouk oida pothen este\)</i></b>. This<br>
 blunt statement cuts the matter short and sweeps away the flimsy<br>
 cobwebs. Acquaintance with Christ in the flesh does not open the<br>
 door. Jesus quotes <!-#-->Ps 8:9 as in <!-#-->Mt 7:23, there as in the LXX,<br>
 here with \pantes ergatai adikias\, there with \hoi ergazomenoi<br>
 t&#275;n anomian\. But \apost&#275;te\ <b><i>(second aorist active imperative)</i></b><br>
 here, and there \apoch&#333;reite\ <b><i>(present active imperative)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:28 <B>{There}</B> <b><i>(\ekei\)</i></b>. Out there, outside the house whence they<br>
 are driven. <B>{When ye shall see}</B> <b><i>(\hotan ops&#275;sthe\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 middle subjunctive <b><i>(of a late aorist \&#333;psam&#275;n\)</i></b> of \hora&#333;\,<br>
 though \opsesthe\ <b><i>(future middle)</i></b> in margin of Westcott and Hort,<br>
 unless we admit here a "future" subjunctive like Byzantine Greek<br>
 <b><i>(after Latin)</i></b>. <B>{And yourselves cast forth without}</B> <b><i>(\hum&#257;s de<br>
 ekballomenous ex&#333;\)</i></b>. Present passive participle, continuous<br>
 action, "you being cast out" with the door shut. See on &#175;Mt<br>
 8:11f. for this same picture.<br>
 <br>
 13:29 <B>{Shall sit down}</B> <b><i>(\anaklith&#275;sontai\)</i></b>. Future passive<br>
 indicative third plural. Recline, of course, is the figure of<br>
 this heavenly banquet. Jesus does not mean that these will be<br>
 saved in different ways, but only that many will come from all<br>
 the four quarters of the earth.<br>
 <br>
 13:30 <B>{Last}</B> <b><i>(\eschatoi\)</i></b>. This saying was repeated many times<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 19:30; Mr 10:31; Mt 20:16)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:31 <B>{In that very hour}</B> <b><i>(\en aut&#275;i t&#275;i h&#333;r&#257;i\)</i></b>. Luke's<br>
 favourite notation of time. <B>{Pharisees}</B> <b><i>(\Pharisaioi\)</i></b>. Here we<br>
 see the Pharisees in a new role, warning Jesus against the<br>
 machinations of Herod, when they are plotting themselves.<br>
 <br>
 13:32 <B>{That fox}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i al&#333;peki taut&#275;i\)</i></b>. This epithet for the<br>
 cunning and cowardice of Herod shows clearly that Jesus<br>
 understood the real attitude and character of the man who had put<br>
 John the Baptist to death and evidently wanted to get Jesus into<br>
 his power in spite of his superstitious fears that he might be<br>
 John the Baptist _redivivus_. The message of Jesus means that he<br>
 is independent of the plots and schemes of both Herod and the<br>
 Pharisees. The preacher is often put in a tight place by<br>
 politicians who are quite willing to see him shorn of all real<br>
 power. <B>{Cures}</B> <b><i>(\iaseis\)</i></b>. Old word, but in the N.T. only here<br>
 and <!-#-->Ac 4:22,30. <B>{I am perfected}</B> <b><i>(\teleioumai\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 passive indicative of \teleio&#333;\, old verb from \teleios\, to<br>
 bring to perfection, frequent in the N.T. Used in <!-#-->Heb 2:10 of<br>
 the Father's purpose in the humanity of Christ. Perfect humanity<br>
 is a process and Jesus was passing through that, without sin, but<br>
 not without temptation and suffering. It is the prophetic present<br>
 with the sense of the future.<br>
 <br>
 13:33 <B>{The day following}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i echomen&#275;i\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ac 20:15. The<br>
 same as the third day in verse <!-#-->32. A proverb. <B>{It cannot be}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ouk endechetai\)</i></b>. It is not accepted, it is inadmissible. A<br>
 severely ironical indictment of Jerusalem. The shadow of the<br>
 Cross reaches Perea where Jesus now is as he starts toward<br>
 Jerusalem.<br>
 <br>
 13:34 <B>{O Jerusalem, Jerusalem}</B> <b><i>(\Ierousal&#275;m, Ierousal&#275;m\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Mt<br>
 23:37f. Jesus utters a similar lament over Jerusalem. The<br>
 connection suits both there and here, but Plummer considers it<br>
 "rather a violent hypothesis" to suppose that Jesus spoke these<br>
 words twice. It is possible, of course, though not like Luke's<br>
 usual method, that he put the words here because of the mention<br>
 of Jerusalem. In itself it is not easy to see why Jesus could not<br>
 have made the lament both here and in Jerusalem. The language of<br>
 the apostrophe is almost identical in both places <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 13:34f.;<br>
 Mt 23:37-39)</i></b>. For details see on Matthew. In Luke we have<br>
 \episunaxai\ <b><i>(late first aorist active infinitive)</i></b> and in Matthew<br>
 \episunagagein\ <b><i>(second aorist active infinitive)</i></b>, both from<br>
 \episunag&#333;\, a double compound of late Greek <b><i>(Polybius)</i></b>. Both<br>
 have "How often would I" <b><i>(\posakis &#275;thel&#275;sa\)</i></b>. How often did I<br>
 wish. Clearly showing that Jesus made repeated visits to<br>
 Jerusalem as we know otherwise only from John's Gospel. <B>{Even as}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hon tropon\)</i></b>. Accusative of general reference and in <!-#-->Mt 23:37<br>
 also. Incorporation of antecedent into the relative clause.<br>
 <B>{Brood}</B> <b><i>(\nossian\)</i></b> is in Luke while Matthew has <B>{chickens}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\nossia\)</i></b>, both late forms for the older \neossia\. The<br>
 adjective <B>{desolate}</B> <b><i>(\er&#275;mos\)</i></b> is wanting in <!-#-->Lu 13:35 and is<br>
 doubtful in <!-#-->Mt 23:39.<br>
