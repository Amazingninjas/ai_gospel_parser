<p>7:1 <B>{Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote}</B> <b><i>(\peri de h&#333;n<br>
 egrapsate\)</i></b>. An ellipsis of \peri tout&#333;n\, the antecedent of<br>
 \peri h&#333;n\, is easily supplied as in papyri. The church had<br>
 written Paul a letter in which a number of specific problems<br>
 about marriage were raised. He answers them _seriatim_. The<br>
 questions must be clearly before one in order intelligently to<br>
 interpret Paul's replies. The first is whether a single life is<br>
 wrong. Paul pointedly says that it is not wrong, but good<br>
 <b><i>(\kalon\)</i></b>. One will get a one-sided view of Paul's teaching on<br>
 marriage unless he keeps a proper perspective. One of the marks<br>
 of certain heretics will be forbidding to marry <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 4:3)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 uses marriage as a metaphor of our relation to Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:2;<br>
 Ro 7:4; Eph 5:28-33)</i></b>. Paul is not here opposing marriage. He is<br>
 only arguing that celibacy may be good in certain limitations.<br>
 The genitive case with \haptesthai\ <b><i>(touch)</i></b> is the usual<br>
 construction.<br>
 <br>
 7:2 <B>{Because of fornications}</B> <b><i>(\dia tas porneias\)</i></b>. This is not<br>
 the only reason for marriage, but it is a true one. The main<br>
 purpose of marriage is children. Mutual love is another. The<br>
 family is the basis of all civilization. Paul does not give a low<br>
 view of marriage, but is merely answering questions put to him<br>
 about life in Corinth.<br>
 <br>
 7:3 <B>{Render the due}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n opheil&#275;n apodidot&#333;\)</i></b>. Marriage is not<br>
 simply not wrong, but for many a duty. Both husband and wife have<br>
 a mutual obligation to the other. "This dictum defends marital<br>
 intercourse against rigorists, as that of ver. <!-#-->1 commends<br>
 celibacy against sensualists" <b><i>(Findlay)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:4 <B>{The wife}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; gun&#275;\)</i></b>. The wife is mentioned first, but the<br>
 equality of the sexes in marriage is clearly presented as the way<br>
 to keep marriage undefiled <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 13:4)</i></b>. "In wedlock separate<br>
 ownership of the person ceases" <b><i>(Robertson and Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:5 <B>{Except it be by consent for a season}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275;ti [an] ek<br>
 sumph&#333;nou pros kairon\)</i></b>. If \an\ is genuine, it can either be<br>
 regarded as like \ean\ though without a verb or as loosely added<br>
 after \ei m&#275;ti\ and construed with it. <B>{That ye may give<br>
 yourselves unto prayer}</B> <b><i>(\hina scholas&#275;te t&#275;i proseuch&#275;i\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active subjunctive of \scholaz&#333;\, late verb from \schol&#275;\,<br>
 leisure <b><i>(our "school")</i></b>, and so to have leisure <b><i>(punctiliar act<br>
 and not permanent)</i></b> for prayer. Note private devotions here. <B>{That<br>
 Satan tempt you not}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275; peiraz&#275;i\)</i></b>. Present subjunctive,<br>
 that Satan may not keep on tempting you. <B>{Because of your<br>
 incontinency}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#275;n akrasian [hum&#333;n]\)</i></b>. A late word from<br>
 Aristotle on for \akrateia\ from \akrat&#275;s\ <b><i>(without self-control,<br>
 \a\ privative and \krate&#333;\, to control, common old word)</i></b>. In N.T.<br>
 only here and <!-#-->Mt 23:25 which see.<br>
 <br>
 7:6 <B>{By way of permission}</B> <b><i>(\kata sungn&#333;m&#275;n\)</i></b>. Old word for<br>
 pardon, concession, indulgence. _Secundum indulgentiam_<br>
 <b><i>(Vulgate)</i></b>. Only here in N.T., though in the papyri for pardon.<br>
 The word means "knowing together," understanding, agreement, and<br>
 so concession. <B>{Not of commandment}</B> <b><i>(\ou kat' epitag&#275;n\)</i></b>. Late<br>
 word <b><i>(in papyri)</i></b> from \epitass&#333;\, old word to enjoin. Paul has<br>
 not commanded people to marry. He has left it an open question.<br>
 <br>
 7:7 <B>{Yet I would}</B> <b><i>(\thel&#333; de\)</i></b>. "But I wish." Followed by<br>
 accusative and infinitive <b><i>(\anthr&#333;pous einai\)</i></b>. This is Paul's<br>
 personal preference under present conditions <b><i>(<!-#-->7:26)</i></b>. <B>{Even as I<br>
 myself}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s kai emauton\)</i></b>. This clearly means that Paul was not<br>
 then married and it is confirmed by <!-#-->9:5. Whether he had been<br>
 married and was now a widower turns on the interpretation of <!-#-->Ac<br>
 26:10 "I cast my vote." If this is taken literally <b><i>(the obvious<br>
 way to take it)</i></b> as a member of the Sanhedrin, Paul was married at<br>
 that time. There is no way to decide. <B>{His own gift from God}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\idion charisma ek theou\)</i></b>. So each must decide for himself. See<br>
 on &#175;1:7 for \charisma\, a late word from \charizomai\.<br>
 <br>
 7:8 <B>{To the unmarried and to the widows}</B> <b><i>(\tois agamois kai tais<br>
 ch&#275;rais\)</i></b>. It is possible that by "the unmarried" <b><i>(masculine<br>
 plural)</i></b> the apostle means only men since widows are added and<br>
 since virgins receive special treatment later <b><i>(verse <!-#-->25)</i></b> and in<br>
 verse <!-#-->32 \ho agamos\ is the unmarried man. It is hardly likely<br>
 that Paul means only widowers and widows and means to call<br>
 himself a widower by \h&#333;s kag&#333;\ <b><i>(even as I)</i></b>. After discussing<br>
 marital relations in verses <!-#-->2-7 he returns to the original<br>
 question in verse <!-#-->1 and repeats his own personal preference as<br>
 in verse <!-#-->7. He does not say that it is _better_ to be<br>
 unmarried, but only that it is _good_ <b><i>(\kalon\ as in verse <!-#-->1)</i></b><br>
 for them to remain unmarried. \Agamos\ is an old word and in N.T.<br>
 occurs only in this passage. In verses <!-#-->11, 34 it is used of<br>
 women where the old Greeks would have used \anandros\, without a<br>
 husband.<br>
 <br>
 7:9 <B>{But if they have not continency}</B> <b><i>(\ei de ouk<br>
 egkrateuontai\)</i></b>. Condition of the first class, assumed as true.<br>
 Direct middle voice \egkrateuontai\, hold themselves in, control<br>
 themselves. <B>{Let them marry}</B> <b><i>(\gam&#275;sat&#333;san\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active imperative. Usual _Koin&#275;_ form in \-t&#333;san\<br>
 for third plural. <B>{Better}</B> <b><i>(\kreitton\)</i></b>. Marriage is better than<br>
 continued sexual passion. Paul has not said that celibacy is<br>
 <B>{better}</B> than marriage though he has justified it and expressed<br>
 his own personal preference for it. The metaphorical use of<br>
 \purousthai\ <b><i>(present middle infinitive)</i></b> for sexual passion is<br>
 common enough as also for grief <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:29)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:10 <B>{To the married}</B> <b><i>(\tois gegam&#275;kosin\)</i></b>. Perfect active<br>
 participle of \game&#333;\, old verb, to marry, and still married as<br>
 the tense shows. <B>{I give charge}</B> <b><i>(\paraggell&#333;\)</i></b>. Not mere wish as<br>
 in verses <!-#-->7,8. <B>{Not I, but the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\ouk eg&#333; alla ho<br>
 kurios\)</i></b>. Paul had no commands from Jesus to the unmarried <b><i>(men<br>
 or women)</i></b>, but Jesus had spoken to the married <b><i>(husbands and<br>
 wives)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Mt 5:31f.; 19:3-12; Mr 10:9-12; Lu 16:18. The<br>
 Master had spoken plain words about divorce. Paul reenforces his<br>
 own inspired command by the command of Jesus. In <!-#-->Mr 10:9 we<br>
 have from Christ: "What therefore God joined together let not man<br>
 put asunder" <b><i>(\m&#275; chorizet&#333;\)</i></b>. <B>{That the wife depart not from her<br>
 husband}</B> <b><i>(\gunaika apo andros m&#275; choristh&#275;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive infinitive <b><i>(indirect command after \paraggell&#333;\)</i></b> of<br>
 \choriz&#333;\, old verb from adverbial preposition \ch&#333;ris\,<br>
 separately, apart from, from. Here used of divorce by the wife<br>
 which, though unusual then, yet did happen as in the case of<br>
 Salome <b><i>(sister of Herod the Great)</i></b> and of Herodias before she<br>
 married Herod Antipas. Jesus also spoke of it <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 10:12)</i></b>. Now<br>
 most of the divorces are obtained by women. This passive<br>
 infinitive is almost reflexive in force according to a constant<br>
 tendency in the _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 817)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:11 <B>{But and if she depart}</B> <b><i>(\ean de kai ch&#333;risth&#275;i\)</i></b>. Third<br>
 class condition, undetermined. If, in spite of Christ's clear<br>
 prohibition, she get separated <b><i>(ingressive passive subjunctive)</i></b>,<br>
 <B>{let her remain unmarried}</B> <b><i>(\menet&#333; agamos\)</i></b>. Paul here makes no<br>
 allowance for remarriage of the innocent party as Jesus does by<br>
 implication. <B>{Or else be reconciled to her husband}</B> <b><i>(\&#275; t&#333;i andri<br>
 katallag&#275;t&#333;\)</i></b>. Second aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> passive imperative of<br>
 \katallass&#333;\, old compound verb to exchange coins as of equal<br>
 value, to reconcile. One of Paul's great words for reconciliation<br>
 with God <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 5:18-20; Ro 5:10)</i></b>. \Diallass&#333;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:24 which<br>
 see)</i></b> was more common in the older Greek, but \katallass&#333;\ in the<br>
 later. The difference in idea is very slight, \dia-\ accents<br>
 notion of exchange, \kat-\ the perfective idea <b><i>(complete<br>
 reconciliation)</i></b>. Dative of personal interest is the case of<br>
 \andri\. This sentence is a parenthesis between the two<br>
 infinitives \ch&#333;risth&#275;nai\ and \aphienai\ <b><i>(both indirect commands<br>
 after \paraggell&#333;\)</i></b>. <B>{And that the husband leave not his wife}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai andra m&#275; aphienai\)</i></b>. This is also part of the Lord's<br>
 command <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 10:11)</i></b>. \Apolu&#333;\ occurs in Mark of the husband's<br>
 act and \aphienai\ here, both meaning to send away. Bengel<br>
 actually stresses the difference between \ch&#333;risth&#275;nai\ of the<br>
 woman as like _separatur_ in Latin and calls the wife "pars<br>
 ignobilior" and the husband "nobilior." I doubt if Paul would<br>
 stand for that extreme.<br>
 <br>
 7:12 <B>{But to the rest say I, not the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\tois de loipois leg&#333;<br>
 eg&#333;, ouch ho Kurios\)</i></b>. Paul has no word about marriage from Jesus<br>
 beyond the problem of divorce. This is no disclaimer of<br>
 inspiration. He simply means that here he is not quoting a<br>
 command of Jesus. <B>{An unbelieving wife}</B> <b><i>(\gunaika apiston\)</i></b>. This<br>
 is a new problem, the result of work among the Gentiles, that did<br>
 not arise in the time of Jesus. The form \apiston\ is the same as<br>
 the masculine because a compound adjective. Paul has to deal with<br>
 mixed marriages as missionaries do today in heathen lands. The<br>
 rest <b><i>(\hoi loipoi\)</i></b> for Gentiles <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph 2:3)</i></b> we have already had<br>
 in <!-#-->1Th 4:13; 5:6 which see. The Christian husband married his<br>
 wife when he himself was an unbeliever. The word \apistos\<br>
 sometimes means unfaithful <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 12:46)</i></b>, but not here <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Joh<br>
 20:27)</i></b>. <B>{She is content}</B> <b><i>(\suneudokei\)</i></b>. Late compound verb to<br>
 be pleased together with, agree together. In the papyri. <B>{Let him<br>
 not leave her}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; aphiet&#333; aut&#275;n\)</i></b>. Perhaps here and in verses<br>
 <!-#-->11,13 \aphi&#275;mi\ should be translated "put away" like \apolu&#333;\<br>
 in <!-#-->Mr 10:1. Some understand \aphi&#275;mi\ as separation from bed<br>
 and board, not divorce.<br>
 <br>
 7:13 <B>{Which hath an unbelieving husband}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;tis echei andra<br>
 apiston\)</i></b>. Relative clause here, while a conditional one in verse<br>
 <!-#-->12 <b><i>(\ei tis\, if any one)</i></b>. Paul is perfectly fair in stating<br>
 both sides of the problem of mixed marriages.<br>
 <br>
 7:14 <B>{Is sanctified in the wife}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;giastai en t&#275;i gunaiki\)</i></b>.<br>
 Perfect passive indicative of \hagiaz&#333;\, to set apart, to hallow,<br>
 to sanctify. Paul does not, of course, mean that the unbelieving<br>
 husband is saved by the faith of the believing wife, though Hodge<br>
 actually so interprets him. Clearly he only means that the<br>
 marriage relation is sanctified so that there is no need of a<br>
 divorce. If either husband or wife is a believer and the other<br>
 agrees to remain, the marriage is holy and need not be set aside.<br>
 This is so simple that one wonders at the ability of men to get<br>
 confused over Paul's language. <B>{Else were your children unclean}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epei ara ta tekna akatharta\)</i></b>. The common ellipse of the<br>
 condition with \epei\: "since, accordingly, if it is otherwise,<br>
 your children are illegitimate <b><i>(\akatharta\)</i></b>." If the relations<br>
 of the parents be holy, the child's birth must be holy also <b><i>(not<br>
 illegitimate)</i></b>. "He is not assuming that the child of a Christian<br>
 parent would be baptized; that would spoil rather than help his<br>
 argument, for it would imply that the child was not \hagios\ till<br>
 it was baptized. The verse throws no light on the question of<br>
 infant baptism" <b><i>(Robertson and Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:15 <B>{Is not under bondage}</B> <b><i>(\ou dedoul&#333;tai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 indicative of \doulo&#333;\, to enslave, has been enslaved, does not<br>
 remain a slave. The believing husband or wife is not at liberty<br>
 to separate, unless the disbeliever or pagan insists on it.<br>
 Wilful desertion of the unbeliever sets the other free, a case<br>
 not contemplated in Christ's words in <!-#-->Mt 5:32; 19:9. Luther<br>
 argued that the Christian partner, thus released, may marry<br>
 again. But that is by no means clear, unless the unbeliever<br>
 marries first. <B>{But God hath called us in peace}</B> <b><i>(\en de eir&#275;n&#275;i<br>
 kekl&#275;ken h&#275;mas\ or \humas\)</i></b>. Perfect active indicative of<br>
 \kale&#333;\, permanent call in the sphere or atmosphere of peace. He<br>
 does not desire enslavement in the marriage relation between the<br>
 believer and the unbeliever.<br>
 <br>
 7:16 <B>{For how knowest thou?}</B> <b><i>(\ti gar oidas;\)</i></b>. But what does<br>
 Paul mean? Is he giving an argument _against_ the believer<br>
 accepting divorce or _in favour_ of doing so? The syntax allows<br>
 either interpretation with \ei\ <b><i>(if)</i></b> after \oidas\. Is the idea<br>
 in \ei\ <b><i>(if)</i></b> _hope_ of saving the other or _fear_ of not saving<br>
 and hence peril in continuing the slavery of such a bondage? The<br>
 latter idea probably suits the context best and is adopted by<br>
 most commentators. And yet one hesitates to interpret Paul as<br>
 _advocating_ divorce unless strongly insisted on by the<br>
 unbeliever. There is no problem at all unless the unbeliever<br>
 makes it. If it is a hopeless case, acquiescence is the only wise<br>
 solution. But surely the believer ought to be sure that there is<br>
 no hope before he agrees to break the bond. Paul raises the<br>
 problem of the wife first as in verse <!-#-->10.<br>
 <br>
 7:17 <B>{Only}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275;\)</i></b>. This use of \ei m&#275;\ as an elliptical<br>
 condition is very common <b><i>(<!-#-->7:5; Ga 1:7,19; Ro 14:14)</i></b>, "except<br>
 that" like \pl&#275;n\. Paul gives a general principle as a limitation<br>
 to what he has just said in verse <!-#-->15. "It states the general<br>
 principle which determines these questions about marriage, and<br>
 this is afterwards illustrated by the cases of circumcision and<br>
 slavery" <b><i>(Robertson and Plummer)</i></b>. He has said that there is to be<br>
 no compulsory slavery between the believer and the disbeliever<br>
 <b><i>(the Christian and the pagan)</i></b>. But on the other hand there is to<br>
 be no reckless abuse of this liberty, no license. <B>{As the Lord<br>
 hath distributed to each man}</B> <b><i>(\hekast&#333;i h&#333;s memeriken ho<br>
 kurios\)</i></b>. Perfect active indicative of \meriz&#333;\, old verb from<br>
 \meros\, apart. Each has his lot from the Lord Jesus, has his<br>
 call from God. He is not to seek a rupture of the marriage<br>
 relation if the unbeliever does not ask for it. <B>{And so ordain I}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai hout&#333;s diatassomai\)</i></b>. Military term, old word, to arrange<br>
 in all the churches <b><i>(distributed, \dia-\)</i></b>. Paul is conscious of<br>
 authoritative leadership as the apostle of Christ to the<br>
 Gentiles.<br>
 <br>
 7:18 <B>{Let him not become uncircumcized}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; epispasth&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present middle imperative of \epispa&#333;\, old verb to draw on. In<br>
 LXX <b><i>(I Macc. 1:15)</i></b> and Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. XII, V. I)</i></b> in this sense.<br>
 Here only in N.T. The point is that a Jew is to remain a Jew, a<br>
 Gentile to be a Gentile. Both stand on an equality in the<br>
 Christian churches. This freedom about circumcision illustrates<br>
 the freedom about Gentile mixed marriages.<br>
 <br>
 7:19 <B>{But the keeping of the commandments of God}</B> <b><i>(\alla t&#275;r&#275;sis<br>
 entol&#333;n theou\)</i></b>. Old word in sense of watching <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 4:3)</i></b>. Paul's<br>
 view of the worthlessness of circumcision or of uncircumcision is<br>
 stated again in <!-#-->Ga 5:6; 6:15; Ro 2:25-29 <b><i>(only the inward or<br>
 spiritual Jew counts)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:20 <B>{Wherein he was called}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;i ekl&#275;th&#275;\)</i></b>. When he was called<br>
 by God and saved, whether a Jew or a Gentile, a slave or a<br>
 freeman.<br>
 <br>
 7:21 <B>{Wast thou called being a bondservant?}</B> <b><i>(\doulos<br>
 ekl&#275;th&#275;s;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative. Wast thou, a slave,<br>
 called? <B>{Care not for it}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; soi melet&#333;\)</i></b>. "Let it not be a<br>
 care to thee." Third person singular <b><i>(impersonal)</i></b> of \melei\, old<br>
 verb with dative \soi\. It was usually a fixed condition and a<br>
 slave could be a good servant of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 3:22; Eph 6:5; Tit<br>
 2:9)</i></b>, even with heathen masters. <B>{Use it rather}</B> <b><i>(\mallon<br>
 chr&#275;sai\)</i></b>. Make use of what? There is no "it" in the Greek. Shall<br>
 we supply \eleutheri&#257;i\ <b><i>(instrumental case after \chr&#275;sai\ or<br>
 \doulei&#257;i\)</i></b>? Most naturally \eleutheri&#257;i\, freedom, from<br>
 \eleutheros\, just before. In that case \ei kai\ is not taken as<br>
 although, but \kai\ goes with \dunasai\, "But if thou canst also<br>
 become free, the rather use your opportunity for freedom." On the<br>
 whole this is probably Paul's idea and is in full harmony with<br>
 the general principle above about mixed marriages with the<br>
 heathen. \Chr&#275;sai\ is second person singular aorist middle<br>
 imperative of \chraomai\, to use, old and common verb.<br>
 <br>
 7:22 <B>{The Lord's freedman}</B> <b><i>(\apeleutheros Kuriou\)</i></b>.<br>
 \Apeleutheros\ is an old word for a manumitted slave,<br>
 \eleutheros\ from \erchomai\, to go and so go free, \ap-\ from<br>
 bondage. Christ is now the owner of the Christian and Paul<br>
 rejoices to call himself Christ's slave <b><i>(\doulos\)</i></b>. But Christ<br>
 set us free from sin by paying the ransom <b><i>(\lutron\)</i></b> of his life<br>
 on the Cross <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 20:28; Ro 8:2; Ga 5:1)</i></b>. Christ is thus the<br>
 _patronus_ of the _libertus_ who owes everything to his<br>
 _patronus_. He is no longer the slave of sin <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 6:6,18)</i></b>, but a<br>
 slave to God <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 6:22)</i></b>. <B>{Likewise the freeman when called is<br>
 Christ's slave}</B> <b><i>(\homoi&#333;s ho eleutheros kl&#275;theis doulos estin<br>
 Christou\)</i></b>. Those who were not slaves, but freemen, when<br>
 converted, are as much slaves of Christ as those who were and<br>
 still were slaves of men. All were slaves of sin and have been<br>
 set free from sin by Christ who now owns them all.<br>
 <br>
 7:23 <B>{Ye were bought with a price}</B> <b><i>(\tim&#275;s &#275;gorasth&#275;te\)</i></b>. See on<br>
 &#175;6:20 for this very phrase, here repeated. Both classes <b><i>(slaves<br>
 and freemen)</i></b> were purchased by the blood of Christ. <B>{Become not<br>
 bondservants of men}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; ginesthe douloi anthr&#333;p&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 middle imperative of \ginomai\ with negative \m&#275;\. Literally,<br>
 stop becoming slaves of men. Paul here clearly defines his<br>
 opposition to human slavery as an institution which comes out so<br>
 powerfully in the Epistle to Philemon. Those already free from<br>
 human slavery should not become enslaved.<br>
 <br>
 7:24 <B>{With God}</B> <b><i>(\para the&#333;i\)</i></b>. There is comfort in that. Even a<br>
 slave can have God at his side by remaining at God's side.<br>
 <br>
 7:25 <B>{I have no commandment of the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\epitag&#275;n Kuriou ouk<br>
 ech&#333;\)</i></b>. A late word from \epitass&#333;\, old Greek verb to enjoin, to<br>
 give orders to. Paul did have <b><i>(verse <!-#-->10)</i></b> a command from the<br>
 Lord as we have in Matthew and Mark. It was quite possible for<br>
 Paul to know this command of Jesus as he did other sayings of<br>
 Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:35)</i></b> even if he had as yet no access to a written<br>
 gospel or had received no direct revelation on the subject from<br>
 Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 11:23)</i></b>. Sayings of Jesus were passed on among the<br>
 believers. But Paul had no specific word from Jesus on the<br>
 subject of virgins. They call for special treatment, young<br>
 unmarried women only Paul means <b><i>(<!-#-->7:25,28,34,36-38)</i></b> and not as<br>
 in <!-#-->Re 14:4 <b><i>(metaphor)</i></b>. It is probable that in the letter<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->7:1)</i></b> the Corinthians had asked about this problem. <B>{But I give<br>
 my judgment}</B> <b><i>(\gn&#333;m&#275;n de did&#333;mi\)</i></b>. About mixed marriages<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->12-16)</i></b> Paul had the command of Jesus concerning divorce to<br>
 guide him. Here he has nothing from Jesus at all. So he gives no<br>
 "command," but only "a judgment," a deliberately formed decision<br>
 from knowledge <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 8:10)</i></b>, not a mere passing fancy. <B>{As one<br>
 that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s<br>
 &#275;le&#275;menos hupo kuriou pistos einai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle<br>
 of \elee&#333;\, old verb to receive mercy <b><i>(\eleos\)</i></b>. \Pistos\ is<br>
 predicate nominative with infinitive \einai\. This language, so<br>
 far from being a disclaimer of inspiration, is an express claim<br>
 to help from the Lord in the forming of this duly considered<br>
 judgment, which is in no sense a command, but an inspired<br>
 opinion.<br>
 <br>
 7:26 <B>{I think therefore}</B> <b><i>(\nomiz&#333; oun\)</i></b>. Paul proceeds to express<br>
 therefore the previously mentioned judgment <b><i>(\gn&#333;m&#275;n\)</i></b> and calls<br>
 it his opinion, not because he is uncertain, but simply because<br>
 it is not a command, but advice. <B>{By reason of the present<br>
 distress}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#275;n enest&#333;san anagk&#275;n\)</i></b>. The participle<br>
 \enest&#333;san\ is second perfect active of \enist&#275;mi\ and means<br>
 "standing on" or "present" <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ga 1:4; Heb 9:9)</i></b>. It occurs in<br>
 <!-#-->2Th 2:2 of the advent of Christ as not "present." Whether Paul<br>
 has in mind the hoped for second coming of Jesus in this verse we<br>
 do not certainly know, though probably so. Jesus had spoken of<br>
 those calamities which would precede his coming <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 24:8ff.)</i></b><br>
 though Paul had denied saying that the advent was right at hand<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 2:2)</i></b>. \Anagk&#275;\ is a strong word <b><i>(old and common)</i></b>, either<br>
 for external circumstances or inward sense of duty. It occurs<br>
 elsewhere for the woes preceding the second coming <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 21:23)</i></b><br>
 and also for Paul's persecutions <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 3:7; 2Co 6:4; 12:10)</i></b>.<br>
 Perhaps there is a mingling of both ideas here. <B>{Namely}</B>. This<br>
 word is not in the Greek. The infinitive of indirect discourse<br>
 <b><i>(\huparchein\)</i></b> after \nomiz&#333;\ is repeated with recitative \hoti\,<br>
 "That the being so is good for a man" <b><i>(\hoti kalon anthr&#333;p&#333;i to<br>
 hout&#333;s einai\)</i></b>. The use of the article \to\ with \einai\ compels<br>
 this translation. Probably Paul means for one <b><i>(\anthr&#333;p&#333;i\,<br>
 generic term for man or woman)</i></b> to remain as he is whether married<br>
 or unmarried. The copula \estin\ is not expressed. He uses<br>
 \kalon\ <b><i>(good)</i></b> as in <!-#-->7:1.<br>
 <br>
 7:27 <B>{Art thou bound to a wife?}</B> <b><i>(\dedesai gunaiki;\)</i></b>. Perfect<br>
 passive indicative of \de&#333;\, to bind, with dative case \gunaiki\.<br>
 Marriage bond as in <!-#-->Ro 7:2. <B>{Seek not to be loosed}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; z&#275;tei<br>
 lusin\)</i></b>. Present active imperative with negative \m&#275;\, "Do not be<br>
 seeking release" <b><i>(\lusin\)</i></b> from the marriage bond, old word, here<br>
 only in N.T. <B>{Seek not a wife}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; z&#275;tei gunaika\)</i></b>. Same<br>
 construction, Do not be seeking a wife. Bachelors as well as<br>
 widowers are included in \lelusai\ <b><i>(loosed, perfect passive<br>
 indicative of \lu&#333;\)</i></b>. This advice of Paul he only urges "because<br>
 of the present necessity" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->26)</i></b>. Whether he held on to<br>
 this opinion later one does not know. Certainly he gives the<br>
 noblest view of marriage in <!-#-->Eph 5:22-33. Paul does not present<br>
 it as his opinion for all men at all times. Men feel it their<br>
 duty to seek a wife.<br>
 <br>
 7:28 <B>{But and if thou marry}</B> <b><i>(\ean de kai gam&#275;s&#275;is\)</i></b>. Condition<br>
 of the third class, undetermined with prospect of being<br>
 determined, with the ingressive first aorist <b><i>(late form)</i></b> active<br>
 subjunctive with \ean\: "But if thou also commit matrimony or get<br>
 married," in spite of Paul's advice to the contrary. <B>{Thou hast<br>
 not sinned}</B> <b><i>(\ouch h&#275;martes\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative of<br>
 \hamartan&#333;\, to sin, to miss a mark. Here either Paul uses the<br>
 timeless <b><i>(gnomic)</i></b> aorist indicative or by a swift transition he<br>
 changes the standpoint <b><i>(proleptic)</i></b> in the conclusion from the<br>
 future <b><i>(in the condition)</i></b> to the past. Such mixed conditions are<br>
 common <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 1020, 1023)</i></b>. Precisely the same<br>
 construction occurs with the case of the virgin <b><i>(\parthenos\)</i></b><br>
 except that the old form of the first aorist subjunctive<br>
 <b><i>(\g&#275;m&#275;i\)</i></b> occurs in place of the late \gam&#275;s&#275;i\ above. The MSS.<br>
 interchange both examples. There is no special point in the<br>
 difference in the forms. <B>{Shall have tribulation in the flesh}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\thlipsin t&#275;i sarki hexousin\)</i></b>. Emphatic position of \thlipsin\<br>
 <b><i>(pressure)</i></b>. See <!-#-->2Co 12:7 \skolops t&#275;i sarki\ <b><i>(thorn in the<br>
 flesh)</i></b>. <B>{And I would spare you}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; de hum&#333;n pheidomai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Possibly conative present middle indicative, I am trying to spare<br>
 you like \agei\ in <!-#-->Ro 2:4 and \dikaiousthe\ in <!-#-->Ga 5:4.<br>
 <br>
 7:29 <B>{But this I say}</B> <b><i>(\touto de ph&#275;mi\. Note \ph&#275;mi\ here rather<br>
 than \leg&#333;\ (verses <!-#-->8,12)</i></b>. A new turn is here given to the<br>
 argument about the present necessity. <B>{The time is shortened}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ho kairos sunestalmenos estin\)</i></b>. Perfect periphrastic passive<br>
 indicative of \sustell&#333;\, old verb to place together, to draw<br>
 together. Only twice in the N.T., here and <!-#-->Ac 5:6 which see.<br>
 Found in the papyri for curtailing expenses. Calvin takes it for<br>
 the shortness of human life, but apparently Paul pictures the<br>
 foreshortening of time <b><i>(opportunity)</i></b> because of the possible<br>
 nearness of and hope for the second coming. But in Philippians<br>
 Paul faces death as his fate <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 1:21-26)</i></b>, though still<br>
 looking for the coming of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->3:20)</i></b>. <B>{That henceforth}</B> <b><i>(\to<br>
 loipon hina\)</i></b>. Proleptic position of \to loipon\ before \hina\<br>
 and in the accusative of general reference and \hina\ has the<br>
 notion of result rather than purpose <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 997)</i></b>. <B>{As though they had none}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s m&#275; echontes\)</i></b>. This use of<br>
 \h&#333;s\ with the participle for an assumed condition is regular and<br>
 \m&#275;\ in the _Koin&#275;_ is the normal negative of the participle. So<br>
 the idiom runs on through verse <!-#-->31.<br>
 <br>
 7:30 <B>{As though they possessed not}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s m&#275; katechontes\)</i></b>. See<br>
 this use of \katech&#333;\, old verb to hold down <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 14:9)</i></b>, to keep<br>
 fast, to possess, in <!-#-->2Co 6:10. Paul means that all earthly<br>
 relations are to hang loosely about us in view of the second<br>
 coming.<br>
 <br>
 7:31 <B>{Those that use the world}</B> <b><i>(\hoi chr&#333;menoi ton kosmon\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 verb \chraomai\, usually with the instrumental case, but the<br>
 accusative occurs in some Cretan inscriptions and in late writers<br>
 according to a tendency of verbs to resume the use of the<br>
 original accusative <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 468)</i></b>. <B>{As not<br>
 abusing it}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s m&#275; katachr&#275;menoi\)</i></b>. Perfective use of \kata\ in<br>
 composition, old verb, but here only in N.T., to use up, use to<br>
 the full. Papyri give examples of this sense. This is more likely<br>
 the idea than "abusing" it. <B>{For the fashion of this world<br>
 passeth away}</B> <b><i>(\paragei gar to sch&#275;ma tou kosmou toutou\)</i></b>. Cf.<br>
 <!-#-->1Jo 2:17. \Sch&#275;ma\ is the _habitus_, the outward appearance,<br>
 old word, in N.T. only here and <!-#-->Php 2:7f. \Paragei\ <b><i>(old word)</i></b><br>
 means "passes along" like a moving panorama <b><i>(movie show!)</i></b>. Used<br>
 of Jesus passing by in Jericho <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 20:30)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:32 <B>{Free from cares}</B> <b><i>(\amerimnous\)</i></b>. Old compound adjective<br>
 <b><i>(\a\ privative and \merimna\, anxiety)</i></b>. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mt<br>
 28:14 which see. <B>{The things of the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\ta tou Kuriou\)</i></b>. The<br>
 ideal state <b><i>(so as to the widow and the virgin in verse <!-#-->33)</i></b>,<br>
 but even the unmarried do let the cares of the world choke the<br>
 word <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 4:19)</i></b>. <B>{How he may please the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;s ares&#275;i t&#333;i<br>
 Kuri&#333;i\)</i></b>. Deliberative subjunctive with \p&#333;s\ retained in an<br>
 indirect question. Dative case of \Kuri&#333;i\. Same construction in<br>
 verse <!-#-->33 with \p&#333;s ares&#275;i t&#275;i gunaiki\ <b><i>(his wife)</i></b> and in <!-#-->34<br>
 \p&#333;s ares&#275;i t&#333;i andri\ <b><i>(her husband)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:34 <B>{And there is a difference also between the wife and the<br>
 virgin}</B> <b><i>(\kai memeristai kai h&#275; gun&#275; kai h&#275; parthenos\)</i></b>. But the<br>
 text here is very uncertain, almost hopelessly so. Westcott and<br>
 Hort put \kai memeristai\ in verse <!-#-->33 and begin a new sentence<br>
 with \kai h&#275; gun&#275;\ and add \h&#275; agamos\ after \h&#275; gun&#275;\, meaning<br>
 "the widow and the virgin each is anxious for the things of the<br>
 Lord" like the unmarried man <b><i>(\ho agamos\, bachelor or widow)</i></b> in<br>
 verse <!-#-->32. Possibly so, but the MSS. vary greatly at every<br>
 point. At any rate Paul's point is that the married woman is more<br>
 disposed to care for the things of the world. But, alas, how many<br>
 unmarried women <b><i>(virgins and widows)</i></b> are after the things of the<br>
 world today and lead a fast and giddy life.<br>
 <br>
 7:35 <B>{For your own profit}</B> <b><i>(\pros to hum&#333;n aut&#333;n sumphoron\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 adjective, advantageous, with neuter article here as substantive,<br>
 from verb \sumpher&#333;\. In N.T. here only and <!-#-->10:33. Note<br>
 reflexive plural form \hum&#333;n aut&#333;n\. <B>{Not that I may cast a snare<br>
 upon you}</B> <b><i>(\ouch hina brochon humin epibal&#333;\)</i></b>. \Brochon\ is a<br>
 noose or slip-knot used for lassoing animals, old word, only here<br>
 in N.T. Papyri have an example "hanged by a noose." \Epibal&#333;\ is<br>
 second aorist active subjunctive of \epiball&#333;\, old verb to cast<br>
 upon. Paul does not wish to capture the Corinthians by lasso and<br>
 compel them to do what they do not wish about getting married.<br>
 <B>{For that which is seemly}</B> <b><i>(\pros to eusch&#275;mon\)</i></b>. Old adjective<br>
 <b><i>(\eu\, well, \sch&#275;m&#333;n\, shapely, comely, from \sch&#275;ma\, figure)</i></b>.<br>
 For the purpose of decorum. <B>{Attend upon the Lord}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\euparedron\)</i></b>. Adjective construed with \pros to\, before, late<br>
 word <b><i>(Hesychius)</i></b> from \eu\, well, and \paredros\, sitting beside,<br>
 "for the good position beside the Lord" <b><i>(associative instrumental<br>
 case of \Kuri&#333;i\)</i></b>. Cf. Mary sitting at the feet of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 10:39)</i></b>. <B>{Without distraction}</B> <b><i>(\aperispast&#333;s\)</i></b>. Late adverb<br>
 <b><i>(Polybius, Plutarch, LXX)</i></b> from the adjective \aperispastos\<br>
 <b><i>(common in the papyri)</i></b> from \a\ privative and \perispa&#333;\, to draw<br>
 around <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 10:40)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:36 <B>{That he behaveth himself unseemly}</B> <b><i>(\asch&#275;monein\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 verb, here only in N.T., from \asch&#275;m&#333;n\ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 12:23)</i></b>, from \a\<br>
 privative and \sch&#275;ma\. Occurs in the papyri. Infinitive in<br>
 indirect discourse after \nomizei\ <b><i>(thinks)</i></b> with \ei\ <b><i>(condition<br>
 of first class, assumed as true)</i></b>. <B>{If she be past the flower of<br>
 her age}</B> <b><i>(\ean &#275;i huperakmos\)</i></b>. Old word, only here in N.T., from<br>
 \huper\ <b><i>(over)</i></b> and \akm&#275;\ <b><i>(prime or bloom of life)</i></b>, past the<br>
 bloom of youth, _superadultus_ <b><i>(Vulgate)</i></b>. Compound adjective with<br>
 feminine form like masculine. Apparently the Corinthians had<br>
 asked Paul about the duty of a father towards his daughter old<br>
 enough to marry. <B>{If need so requireth}</B> <b><i>(\kai hout&#333;s opheilei<br>
 ginesthai\)</i></b>. "And it ought to happen." Paul has discussed the<br>
 problem of marriage for virgins on the grounds of expediency. Now<br>
 he faces the question where the daughter wishes to marry and<br>
 there is no serious objection to it. The father is advised to<br>
 consent. Roman and Greek fathers had the control of the marriage<br>
 of their daughters. "My marriage is my father's care; it is not<br>
 for me to decide about that" <b><i>(Hermione in Euripides'<br>
 _Andromache_, 987)</i></b>. <B>{Let them marry}</B> <b><i>(\gameit&#333;san\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 active plural imperative <b><i>(long form)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:37 <B>{To keep his own virgin daughter}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;rein t&#275;n heautou<br>
 parthenon\)</i></b>. This means the case when the virgin daughter does<br>
 not wish to marry and the father agrees with her, <B>{he shall do<br>
 well}</B> <b><i>(\kal&#333;s poi&#275;sei\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:38 <B>{Doeth well}</B> <b><i>(\kal&#333;s poiei\)</i></b>. So Paul commends the father<br>
 who gives his daughter in marriage <b><i>(\gamizei\)</i></b>. This verb<br>
 \gamiz&#333;\ has not been found outside the N.T. See on &#175;Mt 22:30.<br>
 <B>{Shall do better}</B> <b><i>(\kreisson poi&#275;sei\)</i></b>. In view of the present<br>
 distress <b><i>(<!-#-->7:26)</i></b> and the shortened time <b><i>(<!-#-->7:29)</i></b>. And yet, when<br>
 all is said, Paul leaves the whole problem of getting married an<br>
 open question to be settled by each individual case.<br>
 <br>
 7:39 <B>{For so long time as her husband liveth}</B> <b><i>(\eph' hoson<br>
 chronon z&#275;i ho an&#275;r aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. While he lives <b><i>(\t&#333;i z&#333;nti andri\)</i></b><br>
 Paul says in <!-#-->Ro 7:2. This is the ideal and is pertinent today<br>
 when husbands meet their ex-wives and wives meet their<br>
 ex-husbands. There is a screw loose somewhere. Paul here treats<br>
 as a sort of addendum the remarriage of widows. He will discuss<br>
 it again in <!-#-->1Ti 5:9-13 and then he will advise younger widows<br>
 to marry. Paul leaves her free here also to be married again,<br>
 "only in the Lord" <b><i>(\monon en Kuri&#333;i\)</i></b>. Every marriage ought to<br>
 be "in the Lord." <B>{To be married}</B> <b><i>(\gam&#275;th&#275;nai\)</i></b> is first aorist<br>
 passive infinitive followed by the dative relative \h&#333;i\ with<br>
 unexpressed antecedent \tout&#333;i\.<br>
 <br>
 7:40 <B>{Happier}</B> <b><i>(\makari&#333;ter&#257;\)</i></b>. Comparative of \makarios\ used in<br>
 the Beatitudes <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:3ff.)</i></b>. <B>{After my judgment}</B> <b><i>(\kata t&#275;n em&#275;n<br>
 gn&#333;m&#275;n\)</i></b>. The same word used in verse <!-#-->25, not a command. <B>{I<br>
 think}</B> <b><i>(\dok&#333;\)</i></b>. From \doke&#333;\, not \nomiz&#333;\ of verse <!-#-->26. But he<br>
 insists that he has "the spirit of God" <b><i>(\pneuma theou\)</i></b> in the<br>
 expression of his inspired judgment on this difficult,<br>
 complicated, tangled problem of marriage. But he has discharged<br>
 his duty and leaves each one to decide for himself.<br>
