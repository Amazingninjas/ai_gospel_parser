<p>15:1 <B>{In the morning}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;i\)</i></b>. The ratification meeting after<br>
 day. See on &#175;Mt 26:1-5 for details. <B>{Held a consultation}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sumboulion poi&#275;santes\)</i></b>. So text of Westcott and Hort <b><i>(Vulgate<br>
 _consilium facientes_)</i></b>, though they give \hetoimasantes\ in the<br>
 margin. The late and rare word \sumboulion\ is like the Latin<br>
 _consilium_. If \hetoimasantes\ is the correct text, the idea<br>
 would be rather to prepare a concerted plan of action <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>.<br>
 But their action was illegal on the night before and they felt<br>
 the need of this ratification after dawn which is described in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 22:66-71, who does not give the illegal night trial. <B>{Bound<br>
 Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\d&#275;santes ton I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. He was bound on his arrest <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 18:12)</i></b> when brought before Annas who sent him on bound to<br>
 Caiaphas <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:24)</i></b> and now he is bound again as he is sent to<br>
 Pilate <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 15:1; Mt 27:2)</i></b>. It is implied that he was unbound<br>
 while before Annas and then before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin.<br>
 <br>
 15:2 <B>{Art thou the King of the Jews?}</B> <b><i>(\Su ei ho basileus t&#333;n<br>
 Ioudai&#333;n;\)</i></b>. This is the only one of the charges made by the<br>
 Sanhedrin to Pilate <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:2)</i></b> that he notices. He does not<br>
 believe this one to be true, but he has to pay attention to it or<br>
 be liable to charges himself of passing over a man accused of<br>
 rivalry and revolution against Caesar. <!-#-->Joh 18:28-32 gives the<br>
 interview with Jesus that convinces Pilate that he is a harmless<br>
 religious fanatic. See on &#175;Mt 26:11. <B>{Thou sayest}</B> <b><i>(\su<br>
 legeis\)</i></b>. An affirmation, though in <!-#-->Joh 18:34-37 there is a<br>
 second and fuller interview between Pilate and Jesus. "Here, as<br>
 in the trial before the Sanhedrin, this is the one question that<br>
 Jesus answers. It is the only question on which his own testimony<br>
 is important and necessary" <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>. The Jews were out on the<br>
 pavement or sidewalk outside the palace while Pilate came out to<br>
 them from above on the balcony <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 18:28f.)</i></b> and had his<br>
 interviews with Jesus on the inside, calling Jesus thither <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 18:33)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:3 <B>{Accused him of many things}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;goroun autou polla\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect tense, repeated accusations besides those already made.<br>
 They let loose their venom against Jesus. One of the common verbs<br>
 for speaking against in court <b><i>(\kata\ and \agoreu&#333;\)</i></b>. It is used<br>
 with the genitive of the person and the accusative of the thing.<br>
 <br>
 15:5 <B>{Marvelled}</B> <b><i>(\thaumazein\)</i></b>. Pilate was sure of the innocence<br>
 of Jesus and saw through their envy <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 15:10)</i></b>, but he was<br>
 hoping that Jesus would answer these charges to relieve him of<br>
 the burden. He marvelled also at the self-control of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 15:6 <B>{Used to release}</B> <b><i>(\apeluen\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense of customary<br>
 action where <!-#-->Mt 27:15 has the verb \ei&#333;thei\ <b><i>(was accustomed<br>
 to)</i></b>. <B>{They asked of him}</B> <b><i>(\par&#275;itounto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle,<br>
 expressing their habit also.<br>
 <br>
 15:7 <B>{Bound with them that had made insurrection}</B> <b><i>(\meta t&#333;n<br>
 stasiast&#333;n dedemenos\)</i></b>. A desperate criminal, leader in the<br>
 insurrection, sedition <b><i>(\en t&#275;i stasei\)</i></b>, or revolution against<br>
 Rome, the very thing that the Jews up at Bethsaida Julias had<br>
 wanted Jesus to lead <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:15)</i></b>. Barabbas was the leader of<br>
 these rioters and was bound with them. <B>{Had committed murder}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\phonon pepoi&#275;keisan\)</i></b>. Past perfect indicative without augment.<br>
 Murder usually goes with such rioters and the priests and people<br>
 actually chose a murderer in preference to Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 15:8 <B>{As he was wont to do unto them}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s epoiei autois\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect of customary action again and dative case.<br>
 <br>
 15:9 <B>{The King of the Jews}</B> <b><i>(\ton basilea t&#333;n Ioudai&#333;n\)</i></b>. That<br>
 phrase from this charge sharpened the contrast between Jesus and<br>
 Barabbas which is bluntly put in <!-#-->Mt 27:17 "Barabbas or Jesus<br>
 which is called Christ." See discussion there.<br>
 <br>
 15:10 <B>{He perceived}</B> <b><i>(\egin&#333;sken\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense descriptive<br>
 of Pilate's growing apprehension from their conduct which<br>
 increased his intuitive impression at the start. It was gradually<br>
 dawning on him. Both Mark and Matthew give "envy" <b><i>(\phthonon\)</i></b> as<br>
 the primary motive of the Sanhedrin. Pilate probably had heard of<br>
 the popularity of Jesus by reason of the triumphal entry and the<br>
 temple teaching. <B>{Had delivered}</B> <b><i>(\paraded&#333;keisan\)</i></b>. Past perfect<br>
 indicative without augment where <!-#-->Mt 27:18 has the first aorist<br>
 <b><i>(kappa aorist)</i></b> indicative \pared&#333;kan\, not preserving the<br>
 distinction made by Mark. The aorist is never used "as" a past<br>
 perfect.<br>
 <br>
 15:11 <B>{Stirred up}</B> <b><i>(\aneseisan\)</i></b>. <B>{Shook up}</B> like an earthquake<br>
 <b><i>(\seismos\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 27:20 has a weaker word, "persuaded"<br>
 <b><i>(\epeisan\)</i></b>. Effective aorist indicative. The priests and scribes<br>
 had amazing success. If one wonders why the crowd was fickle, he<br>
 may recall that this was not yet the same people who followed him<br>
 in triumphal entry and in the temple. That was the plan of Judas<br>
 to get the thing over before those Galilean sympathizers waked<br>
 up. "It was a case of regulars against an irregular, of priests<br>
 against prophet" <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>. "But Barabbas, as described by Mark,<br>
 represented a popular passion, which was stronger than any<br>
 sympathy they might have for so unworldly a character as<br>
 Jesus--the passion for _political liberty_" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. "What<br>
 unprincipled characters they were! They accuse Jesus to Pilate of<br>
 political ambition, and they recommend Barabbas to the people for<br>
 the same reason" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. The Sanhedrin would say to the people<br>
 that Jesus had already abdicated his kingly claims while to<br>
 Pilate they went on accusing him of treason to Caesar. <B>{Rather}</B><br>
 <b><i>(_m&#257;llon_)</i></b>. Rather than Jesus. It was a gambler's choice.<br>
 <br>
 15:12 <B>{Whom ye call the King of the Jews}</B> <b><i>(\hon legete ton<br>
 basilea t&#333;n Ioudai&#333;n\)</i></b>. Pilate rubs it in on the Jews <b><i>(cf. verse<br>
 <!-#-->9)</i></b>. The "then" <b><i>(\oun\)</i></b> means since you have chosen Barabbas<br>
 instead of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 15:13 <B>{Crucify him}</B> <b><i>(\Staur&#333;son auton\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu 23:21 repeats the<br>
 verb. <!-#-->Mt 27:22 has it, "Let him be crucified." There was a<br>
 chorus and a hubbub of confused voices all demanding crucifixion<br>
 for Christ. Some of the voices beyond a doubt had joined in the<br>
 hallelujahs to the Son of David in the triumphal entry. See on<br>
 &#175;Mt 27:23 for discussion of <!-#-->Mr 15:14.<br>
 <br>
 15:15 <B>{To content the multitude}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i ochl&#333;i to hikanon<br>
 poi&#275;sai\)</i></b>. A Latin idiom <b><i>(_satisfacere alicui_)</i></b>, to do what is<br>
 sufficient to remove one's ground of complaint. This same phrase<br>
 occurs in Polybius, Appian, Diogenes Laertes, and in late papyri.<br>
 Pilate was afraid of this crowd now completely under the control<br>
 of the Sanhedrin. He knew what they would tell Caesar about him.<br>
 See on &#175;Mt 27:26 for discussion of the scourging.<br>
 <br>
 15:16 <B>{The Praetorium}</B> <b><i>(\prait&#333;rion\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Mt 27:27 this same<br>
 word is translated "palace." That is its meaning here also, the<br>
 palace in which the Roman provincial governor resided. In <!-#-->Php<br>
 1:13 it means the Praetorian Guard in Rome. Mark mentions here<br>
 "the court" <b><i>(\t&#275;s aul&#275;s\)</i></b> inside of the palace into which the<br>
 people passed from the street through the vestibule. See further<br>
 on Matthew about the "band."<br>
 <br>
 15:17 <B>{Purple}</B> <b><i>(\porphuran\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 27:28 has "scarlet robe" which<br>
 see for discussion as well as for the crown of thorns.<br>
 <br>
 15:19 <B>{Worshipped him}</B> <b><i>(\prosekunoun\)</i></b>. In mockery. Imperfect<br>
 tense as are \etupton\ <b><i>(smote)</i></b> and \eneptuon\ <b><i>(did spit upon)</i></b>.<br>
 Repeated indignities.<br>
 <br>
 15:20 <B>{They lead him out}</B> <b><i>(\exagousin auton\)</i></b>. Vivid historical<br>
 present after imperfects in verse <!-#-->19.<br>
 <br>
 15:21 <B>{They compel}</B> <b><i>(\aggareuousin\)</i></b>. Dramatic present indicative<br>
 again where <!-#-->Mt 27:32 has the aorist. For this Persian word see<br>
 on &#175;Mt 5:41; 27:32. <B>{Coming out of the country}</B> <b><i>(\erchomenon ap'<br>
 agrou\)</i></b>. Hence Simon met the procession. Mark adds that he was<br>
 "the father of Alexander and Rufus." Paul mentions a Rufus in <!-#-->Ro<br>
 16:13, but it was a common name and proves nothing. See on &#175;Mt<br>
 27:32 for discussion of cross-bearing by criminals. Luke adds<br>
 "after Jesus" <b><i>(\opisthen tou I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. But Jesus bore his own<br>
 cross till he was relieved of it, and he walked in front of his<br>
 own cross for the rest of the way.<br>
 <br>
 15:22 <B>{They bring him}</B> <b><i>(\pherousin auton\)</i></b>. Historical present<br>
 again. See on &#175;Mt 27:33f. for discussion of Golgotha.<br>
 <br>
 15:23 <B>{They offered him}</B> <b><i>(\edidoun aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense where<br>
 Matthew has the aorist \ed&#333;kan\. <B>{Mingled with myrrh}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\esmurnismenon\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle. The verb means<br>
 flavoured with myrrh, myrrhed wine. It is not inconsistent with<br>
 &#175;Mt 27:34 "mingled with gall," which see. <B>{But he received it<br>
 not}</B> <b><i>(\hos de ouk elaben\)</i></b>. Note the demonstrative \hos\ with<br>
 \de\. Matthew has it that Jesus was not willing to take. Mark's<br>
 statement is that he refused it.<br>
 <br>
 15:24 <B>{What each should take}</B> <b><i>(\tis ti &#257;r&#275;i\)</i></b>. Only in Mark. Note<br>
 double interrogative, Who What? The verb \ar&#275;i\ is first aorist<br>
 active deliberative subjunctive retained in the indirect<br>
 question. The details in <!-#-->Mr 15:24-32 are followed closely by<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 27:35-44. See there for discussion of details.<br>
 <br>
 15:25 <B>{The third hour}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ra trit&#275;\)</i></b>. This is Jewish time and<br>
 would be nine A.M. The trial before Pilate was the sixth hour<br>
 Roman time <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:14)</i></b>, six A.M.<br>
 <br>
 15:26 <B>{The superscription}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; epigraph&#275;\)</i></b>. The writing upon the<br>
 top of the cross <b><i>(our word epigraph)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu 23:38 has this same<br>
 word, but <!-#-->Mt 27:37 has "accusation" <b><i>(\aitian\)</i></b>. See Matthew for<br>
 discussion. <!-#-->Joh 19:19 has "title" <b><i>(\titlon\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:32 <B>{Now come down}</B> <b><i>(\katabat&#333; nun\)</i></b>. Now that he is nailed to<br>
 the cross. <B>{That we may see and believe}</B> <b><i>(\hina id&#333;men kai<br>
 pisteus&#333;men\)</i></b>. Aorist subjunctive of purpose with \hina\. They<br>
 use almost the very language of Jesus in their ridicule, words<br>
 that they had heard him use in his appeals to men to see and<br>
 believe. <B>{Reproached him}</B> <b><i>(\&#333;neidizon auton\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense.<br>
 They did it several times. Mark and Matthew both fail to give the<br>
 story of the robber who turned to Christ on the Cross as told in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 23:39-43.<br>
 <br>
 15:33 <B>{The sixth hour}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ras hekt&#275;s\)</i></b>. That is, noon <b><i>(Jewish<br>
 time)</i></b>, as the third hour was nine A.M. <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 15:25)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt<br>
 27:45 for discussion. Given also by <!-#-->Lu 23:44. Mark gives the<br>
 Aramaic transliteration as does B in <!-#-->Mt 27:45, which see for<br>
 discussion. <B>{Forsaken}</B> <b><i>(\egkatelipes\)</i></b>. Some MSS. give<br>
 \&#333;neidisas\ <b><i>(reproached)</i></b>. We are not able to enter into the<br>
 fulness of the desolation felt by Jesus at this moment as the<br>
 Father regarded him as sin <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 5:21)</i></b>. This desolation was the<br>
 deepest suffering. He did not cease to be the Son of God. That<br>
 would be impossible.<br>
 <br>
 15:35 <B>{He calleth Elijah}</B> <b><i>(\Eleian ph&#333;nei\)</i></b>. They misunderstood<br>
 the \El&#333;i\ or \Elei\ <b><i>(my God)</i></b> for Elijah.<br>
 <br>
 15:36 <B>{To take him down}</B> <b><i>(\kathelein auton\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 27:49 has "to<br>
 save him" <b><i>(\s&#333;s&#333;n\)</i></b>, which see for discussion.<br>
 <br>
 15:37 <B>{Gave up the ghost}</B> <b><i>(\exepneusen\)</i></b>. Literally, breathed<br>
 out. See "yielded up his spirit" in <!-#-->Mt 27:50 for discussion for<br>
 details. Mark uses this word \exepneusen\ again in verse <!-#-->39.<br>
 <br>
 15:39 <B>{The centurion}</B> <b><i>(\ho kenturi&#333;n\)</i></b>. A Latin word <b><i>(_centurio_)</i></b><br>
 used also in verse <!-#-->44 and here only in the N.T. <B>{Which stood by<br>
 over against him}</B> <b><i>(\ho parest&#275;k&#333;s ex enantias autou\)</i></b>. This<br>
 description alone in Mark, picturing the centurion "watching<br>
 Jesus" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:54)</i></b>. <B>{So}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s\)</i></b>. With the darkness and the<br>
 earthquake. See on &#175;Mt 27:54 for discussion of "the Son of God,"<br>
 more probably "a Son of God."<br>
 <br>
 15:40 <B>{And Salome}</B> <b><i>(\kai Sal&#333;m&#275;\)</i></b>. Apparently the "mother of the<br>
 sons of Zebedee" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:56)</i></b>. Only in Mark.<br>
 <br>
 15:41 <B>{Followed him and ministered unto him}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kolouthoun kai<br>
 di&#275;konoun aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Two imperfects describing the long Galilean<br>
 ministry of these three women and many other women in Galilee<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:1-3)</i></b> who came up with him <b><i>(\hai sunanab&#257;sai aut&#333;i\)</i></b> to<br>
 Jerusalem. This summary description in Mark is paralleled in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 27:55f. and <!-#-->Lu 23:49. These faithful women were last at the<br>
 Cross as they stood afar and saw the dreadful end to all their<br>
 hopes.<br>
 <br>
 15:42 <B>{The preparation}</B> <b><i>(\paraskeu&#275;\)</i></b>. Mark explains the term as<br>
 meaning "the day before the sabbath" <b><i>(\prosabbaton\)</i></b>, that is our<br>
 Friday, which began at sunset. See discussion on &#175;Mt 27:57. The<br>
 Jews had already taken steps to get the bodies removed <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 19:31)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:43 <B>{A councillor of honourable estate}</B> <b><i>(\eusch&#275;m&#333;n<br>
 bouleut&#275;s\)</i></b>. A senator or member of the Sanhedrin of high<br>
 standing, rich <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:57)</i></b>. <B>{Looking for the Kingdom of God}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;n prosdechomenos t&#275;n basileian tou theou\)</i></b>. Periphrastic<br>
 imperfect. Also <!-#-->Lu 23:51. The very verb used by Luke of Simeon<br>
 and Anna <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:25,38)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 27:57 calls him "Jesus' disciple"<br>
 while <!-#-->Joh 19:38 adds "secretly for fear of the Jews." He had<br>
 evidently taken no public stand for Jesus before now. <B>{Boldly}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\tolm&#275;sas\)</i></b>. Aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active participle, becoming<br>
 bold. It is the glory of Joseph and Nicodemus, secret disciples<br>
 of Jesus, that they took a bold stand when the rest were in<br>
 terror and dismay. That is love psychology, paradoxical as it may<br>
 seem.<br>
 <br>
 15:44 <B>{If he were already dead}</B> <b><i>(\ei &#275;d&#275; tethn&#275;ken\)</i></b>. Perfect<br>
 active indicative with \ei\ after a verb of wondering, a<br>
 classical idiom, a kind of indirect question just as we say "I<br>
 wonder if." Usually death by crucifixion was lingering. This item<br>
 is only in Mark. <B>{Whether he had been any while dead}</B> <b><i>(\ei palai<br>
 apethanen\)</i></b>. B D read \&#275;d&#275;\ <b><i>(already)</i></b> again here instead of<br>
 \palai\ <b><i>(a long time)</i></b>. Mark does not tell the request of the Jews<br>
 to Pilate that the legs of the three might be broken <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 19:31-37)</i></b>. Pilate wanted to make sure that Jesus was actually<br>
 dead by official report.<br>
 <br>
 15:45 <B>{Granted the corpse}</B> <b><i>(\ed&#333;r&#275;sato to pt&#333;ma\)</i></b>. This official<br>
 information was necessary before the burial. As a matter of fact<br>
 Pilate was probably glad to turn the body over to Joseph else the<br>
 body would go to the potter's field. This is the only instance<br>
 when \pt&#333;ma\ <b><i>(_cadaver_, corpse)</i></b> is applied to the body <b><i>(\s&#333;ma\)</i></b><br>
 of Jesus, the term used in <!-#-->Mt 27:59; Lu 23:53; Joh 19:40)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:46 <B>{Wound}</B> <b><i>(\eneil&#275;sen\)</i></b>. This word is only here in the N.T.<br>
 As \entuliss&#333;\ is only in <!-#-->Mt 27:59; Lu 23:53; Joh 20:7. Both<br>
 verbs occur in the papyri, Plutarch, etc. They both mean to wrap,<br>
 wind, roll in. The body of Jesus was wound in the linen cloth<br>
 bought by Joseph and the hundred pounds of spices brought by<br>
 Nicodemus <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:39)</i></b> for burying were placed in the folds of<br>
 the linen and the linen was bound around the body by strips of<br>
 cloth <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:40)</i></b>. The time was short before the sabbath began<br>
 and these two reverently laid the body of the Master in Joseph's<br>
 new tomb, hewn out of a rock. The perfect passive participle<br>
 <b><i>(\lelatom&#275;menon\)</i></b> is from \latomos\, a stonecutter <b><i>(\l&#333;s\, stone,<br>
 \temn&#333;\, to cut)</i></b>. For further details see on &#175;Mt 27:57-60. <!-#-->Lu<br>
 23:53 and <!-#-->Joh 19:41 also tell of the new tomb of Joseph. Some<br>
 modern scholars think that this very tomb has been identified in<br>
 Gordon's Calvary north of the city. <B>{Against the door}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;n<br>
 thuran\)</i></b>. Matthew has the dative \t&#275;i thur&#257;i\ without \epi\ and<br>
 adds the adjective "great" <b><i>(\megan\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:47 <B>{Beheld}</B> <b><i>(\ethe&#333;roun\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense picturing the two<br>
 Marys "sitting over against the sepulchre" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:61)</i></b> and<br>
 watching in silence as the shadows fell upon all their hopes and<br>
 dreams. Apparently these two remained after the other women who<br>
 had been beholding from afar the melancholy end <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 15:40)</i></b> had<br>
 left and "were watching the actions of Joseph and Nicodemus"<br>
 <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. Probably also they saw the body of Jesus carried and<br>
 hence they knew where it was laid and saw that it remained there<br>
 <b><i>(\tetheitai\, perfect passive indicative, state of completion)</i></b>.<br>
 "It is evident that they constituted themselves a party of<br>
 observation" <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>.<br>
