<p>4:1 <B>{I charge thee}</B> <b><i>(\diamarturomai\)</i></b>. Rather, "I testify." See<br>
 <!-#-->1Th 4:6. See <!-#-->1Ti 5:21 for this verb and appeal to God and<br>
 Christ. <B>{Who shall judge}</B> <b><i>(\tou mellontos krinein\)</i></b>. "The one<br>
 going or about to judge" <b><i>(regular idiom with \mell&#333;\)</i></b>. The quick<br>
 and the dead <b><i>(\z&#333;ntas kai nekrous\)</i></b>. "Living and dead." See <!-#-->1Th<br>
 4:16f. <B>{And by his appearing}</B> <b><i>(\kai t&#275;n epiphaneian\)</i></b>.<br>
 Accusative of conjuration <b><i>(verbs of swearing)</i></b>, after<br>
 \diamarturomai\ as is \basileian\ <b><i>(by his kingdom)</i></b>. See <!-#-->1Th<br>
 5:27. For \epiphaneian\, see <!-#-->1:10; Tit 2:13; 1Ti 6:14; 2Th<br>
 2:8.<br>
 <br>
 4:2 <B>{Preach the word}</B> <b><i>(\k&#275;ruxon ton logon\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 imperative of \k&#275;russ&#333;\. For "the word" used absolutely, see <!-#-->1Th<br>
 1:6; Ga 6:6. <B>{Be instant in season, out of season}</B> <b><i>(\epist&#275;thi<br>
 eukair&#333;s akair&#333;s\)</i></b>. Second aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active imperative<br>
 of \ephist&#275;mi\ <b><i>(intransitive use)</i></b>, "take a stand," "stand upon it<br>
 or up to it," "carry on," "stick to it." The Vulgate has<br>
 "_insta_." The two adverbs are like a proverb or a play <b><i>(pun)</i></b> on<br>
 the word \kairos\. There are all sorts of seasons <b><i>(\kairoi\)</i></b>,<br>
 some difficult <b><i>(\chalepoi\, <!-#-->3:1)</i></b>, some easy <b><i>(\eukair&#275;i\, <!-#-->1Co<br>
 16:12)</i></b>. <B>{Reprove}</B> <b><i>(\elegxon\)</i></b>. First aorist active imperative of<br>
 \elegch&#333;\. "Bring to proof." <!-#-->Eph 5:11. <B>{Rebuke}</B> <b><i>(\epitim&#275;son\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active imperative of \epitima&#333;\, to give honour <b><i>(or<br>
 blame)</i></b> to, to chide. Common in the Gospels <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 17:3)</i></b>. <B>{Exhort}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\parakaleson\)</i></b>. First aorist active imperative of \parakale&#333;\,<br>
 common Pauline word.<br>
 <br>
 4:3 <B>{A time when}</B> <b><i>(\kairos hote\)</i></b>. One of the \akair&#333;s\ <b><i>(out of<br>
 season)</i></b> times. <B>{Will not endure}</B> <b><i>(\ouk anexontai\)</i></b>. Future middle<br>
 <b><i>(direct)</i></b> of \anech&#333;\. "Will not hold themselves back from" <b><i>(Col.<br>
 <!-#-->3:13)</i></b>. Having itching ears <b><i>(\kn&#275;thomenoi t&#275;n ako&#275;n\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 middle <b><i>(causative)</i></b> participle of \kn&#275;th&#333;\, late and rare form of<br>
 the Attic \kna&#333;\, to scratch, to tickle, here only in N.T.<br>
 "Getting the ears <b><i>(the hearing, \t&#275;n ako&#275;n\)</i></b> tickled." The<br>
 Vulgate has \prurientes\. Cf. the Athenians <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 17:21)</i></b>. Clement<br>
 of Alexandria tells of speakers tickling <b><i>(\kn&#275;thontes\)</i></b> the ears<br>
 of those who want to be tickled. This is the temptation of the<br>
 merely "popular" preacher, to furnish the latest tickle.<br>
 <br>
 4:4 <B>{Will turn away their ears}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n ako&#275;n apostrepsousin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Future active of old verb \apostreph&#333;\. See <!-#-->1Co 12:17 for this<br>
 use of \ako&#275;\. The people stopped their ears and rushed at<br>
 Stephen in <!-#-->Ac 7:57. <B>{Will turn aside}</B> <b><i>(\ektrap&#275;sontai\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 future passive of \ektrep&#333;\. They prefer "myths" to "the truth"<br>
 as some today turn away to "humanism," "bolshevism," "new<br>
 thought" or any other fad that will give a new momentary thrill<br>
 to their itching ears and morbid minds.<br>
 <br>
 4:5 <B>{But be thou sober}</B> <b><i>(\su de n&#275;phe\)</i></b>. Present active<br>
 imperative of \n&#275;ph&#333;\, for which see <!-#-->1Th 5:6,8. "Be sober in<br>
 thy head." <B>{Suffer hardship}</B> <b><i>(\kakopath&#275;son\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->2:9. <B>{Do the<br>
 work of an evangelist}</B> <b><i>(\ergon poi&#275;son euaggelistou\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->1Co<br>
 1:17; Eph 4:11 for \euaggelist&#275;s\, gospelizer. <B>{Fulfil}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pl&#275;rophor&#275;son\)</i></b>. First aorist active imperative of<br>
 \pl&#275;rophore&#333;\, for which see <!-#-->Col 4:12. In <!-#-->Col 4:17 Paul uses<br>
 \pl&#275;ro&#333;\ to Archippus about his ministry as he here employs<br>
 \pl&#275;rophore&#333;\. Both verbs mean to fill full.<br>
 <br>
 4:6 <B>{I am already being offered}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;d&#275; spendomai\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 <b><i>(progressive)</i></b> passive indicative of \spend&#333;\, old verb, to pour<br>
 out a libation or drink offering. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->Php<br>
 2:17. "What was then a possibility is now a certainty" <b><i>(Parry)</i></b>.<br>
 The sacrifice of Paul's life-blood has begun. <B>{Of my departure}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\t&#275;s analuse&#333;s mou\)</i></b>. Our very word "analysis." Old word from<br>
 \analu&#333;\, to loosen up or back, to unloose. Only here in N.T.,<br>
 though \analusai\ for death is used by Paul in <!-#-->Php 1:23 which<br>
 see for the metaphor. <B>{Is come}</B> <b><i>(\ephest&#275;ken\)</i></b>. Perfect active<br>
 indicative of \ephist&#275;mi\ <b><i>(intransitive use)</i></b>. See <!-#-->1Th 5:3; Lu<br>
 21:34. The hour has struck. The time has come.<br>
 <br>
 4:7 <B>{I have fought the good fight}</B> <b><i>(\ton kalon ag&#333;na &#275;g&#333;nismai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Perfect middle indicative of \ag&#333;nizomai\, a favourite figure<br>
 with Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 9:25; Col 1:29)</i></b>, with the cognate accusative<br>
 \ag&#333;na\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 1:27,30, etc.)</i></b>. The "fight" is the athletic<br>
 contest of his struggle for Christ. <B>{I have finished the course}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ton dromon teteleka\)</i></b>. Perfect active indicative of \tele&#333;\. He<br>
 had used this metaphor also of himself to the elders at Ephesus<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:24)</i></b>. Then the "course" was ahead of him. Now it is<br>
 behind him. <B>{I have kept the faith}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n pistin tet&#275;r&#275;ka\)</i></b>.<br>
 Perfect active indicative again of \t&#275;re&#333;\. Paul has not<br>
 deserted. He has kept faith with Christ. For this phrase, see <!-#-->Re<br>
 14:12. Deissmann <b><i>(_Light, etc._, p. 309)</i></b> gives inscriptions in<br>
 Ephesus of a man who says: "I have kept faith" <b><i>(\t&#275;n pistin<br>
 et&#275;r&#275;sa\)</i></b> and another of a man of whom it is said: "He fought<br>
 three fights, and twice was crowned."<br>
 <br>
 4:8 <B>{Henceforth}</B> <b><i>(\loipon\)</i></b>. Accusative case, "for the rest."<br>
 <B>{There is laid up for me}</B> <b><i>(\apokeitai moi\)</i></b>. Present passive of<br>
 \apokeimai\, old verb, to be laid away. See <!-#-->Col 1:5 for the<br>
 hope laid away. Paul's "crown of righteousness" <b><i>(\ho t&#275;s<br>
 dikaiosun&#275;s stephanos\, genitive of apposition, the crown that<br>
 consists in righteousness and is also the reward for<br>
 righteousness, the victor's crown as in <!-#-->1Co 9:25 which see)</i></b> "is<br>
 laid away" for him. <B>{At that day}</B> <b><i>(\en ekein&#275;i t&#275;i h&#275;mer&#257;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 That great and blessed day <b><i>(<!-#-->1:12,18)</i></b>. <B>{The righteous judge}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ho dikaios krit&#275;s\)</i></b>. "The just judge," the umpire who makes no<br>
 mistakes who judges us all <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 5:10)</i></b>. <B>{Shall give me}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\apod&#333;sei moi\)</i></b>. Future active of \apodid&#333;mi\. "Will give back"<br>
 as in <!-#-->Ro 2:6 and in full. <B>{But also to all them that have loved<br>
 his appearing}</B> <b><i>(\alla p&#257;sin tois &#275;gap&#275;kosin t&#275;n epiphaneian<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. Dative case of the perfect active participle of<br>
 \agapa&#333;\, to love, who have loved and still love his second<br>
 coming. \Epiphaneia\ here can as in <!-#-->1:10 be interpreted of<br>
 Christ's Incarnation.<br>
 <br>
 4:9 <B>{Shortly}</B> <b><i>(\tache&#333;s\)</i></b>. In verse <!-#-->21 he more definitely says<br>
 "before winter." Apparently the trial might drag on through its<br>
 various stages.<br>
 <br>
 4:10 <B>{Forsook me}</B> <b><i>(\me egkateleipen\)</i></b>. Imperfect <b><i>(MSS. also have<br>
 aorist, \egkatelipen\)</i></b> active of the old double compound verb<br>
 \egkataleip&#333;\, for which see <!-#-->Ro 9:29. Clearly in contrast to<br>
 verse <!-#-->9 and in the sense of <!-#-->1Ti 6:17, wilful desertion. Only<br>
 mentioned elsewhere in <!-#-->Col 4:14. <B>{Crescens}</B> <b><i>(\Kr&#275;sk&#275;s\)</i></b>. No<br>
 other mention of him. <B>{Titus to Dalmatia}</B> <b><i>(\Titos eis<br>
 Dalmatian\)</i></b>. Titus had been asked to rejoin Paul in Nicopolis<br>
 where he was to winter, probably the winter previous to this one<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Tit 3:12)</i></b>. He came and has been with Paul.<br>
 <br>
 4:11 <B>{Only Luke is with me}</B> <b><i>(\Loukas estin monos met' emou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Luke is with Paul now in Rome as during the first Roman<br>
 imprisonment <b><i>(<!-#-->Phm 1:24; Col 4:14)</i></b>. <B>{Take Mark}</B> <b><i>(\Markon<br>
 analab&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of \analamban&#333;\, old<br>
 verb, to pick up, as in <!-#-->Eph 6:13,16. "Pick up Mark." <B>{He is<br>
 useful to me}</B> <b><i>(\estin moi euchr&#275;stos\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->2:21 for<br>
 \euchr&#275;stos\. Paul had long ago changed his opinion of Mark <b><i>(<!-#-->Col<br>
 4:10)</i></b> because Mark had changed his conduct and had made good in<br>
 his ministry. Now Paul longs to have the man that he once<br>
 scornfully rejected <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:37ff.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:12 <B>{Tychicus I sent to Ephesus}</B> <b><i>(\Tuchikon apesteila eis<br>
 Epheson\)</i></b>. Perhaps Paul had sent him on before he came to Rome.<br>
 He may have been still on the way to Ephesus.<br>
 <br>
 4:13 <B>{The cloke}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n phelon&#275;n\)</i></b>. More common form \pheilon&#275;\.<br>
 By metathesis for \phainol&#275;\, Latin _paenula_, though which<br>
 language transliterated the word into the other is not known. The<br>
 meaning is also uncertain, though probably "cloke" as there are<br>
 so many papyri examples in that sense <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan,<br>
 _Vocabulary_)</i></b>. Milligan <b><i>(N.T. _Documents_, p. 20)</i></b> had previously<br>
 urged "book wrap" as probable but he changed his mind and rightly<br>
 so. <B>{With Carpus}</B> <b><i>(\para Karp&#333;i\)</i></b>. "Beside Carpus," at his house.<br>
 Not mentioned elsewhere. Probably a visit to Troas after Paul's<br>
 return from Crete. <B>{The books}</B> <b><i>(\ta biblia\)</i></b>. Probably papyrus<br>
 rolls. One can only guess what rolls the old preacher longs to<br>
 have with him, probably copies of Old Testament books, possibly<br>
 copies of his own letters, and other books used and loved. The<br>
 old preacher can be happy with his books. <B>{Especially the<br>
 parchments}</B> <b><i>(\malista tas membranas\)</i></b>. Latin _membrana_. The<br>
 dressed skins were first made at Pergamum and so termed<br>
 "parchments." These in particular would likely be copies of Old<br>
 Testament books, parchment being more expensive than papyrus,<br>
 possibly even copies of Christ's sayings <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:1-4)</i></b>. We recall<br>
 that in <!-#-->Ac 26:24 Festus referred to Paul's learning <b><i>(\ta<br>
 grammata\)</i></b>. He would not waste his time in prison.<br>
 <br>
 4:14 <B>{Alexander the coppersmith}</B> <b><i>(\Alexandros ho chalkeus\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 word, only here in N.T., for metal-worker <b><i>(copper, iron, gold,<br>
 etc.)</i></b>. Possibly the one in <!-#-->1:20, but not the one in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 19:33f. unless he afterwards became a Christian. <B>{Did me much<br>
 evil}</B> <b><i>(\moi kaka enedeixato\)</i></b>. Evidently he had some personal<br>
 dislike towards Paul and possibly also he was a Gnostic. <B>{Will<br>
 render}</B> <b><i>(\apod&#333;sei\)</i></b>. Future active of the same verb used in<br>
 verse <!-#-->8, but with a very different atmosphere.<br>
 <br>
 4:15 <B>{Be thou ware also}</B> <b><i>(\kai su phulassou\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 <b><i>(direct)</i></b> imperative of \phulass&#333;\, "from whom keep thyself away."<br>
 <B>{Withstood}</B> <b><i>(\antest&#275;\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative of<br>
 \anthist&#275;mi\, "stood against my words." See <!-#-->3:8; Ga 2:11.<br>
 <br>
 4:16 <B>{At my first defence}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i pr&#333;t&#275;i apologi&#257;i\)</i></b>. Original<br>
 sense of "apology" as in <!-#-->Php 1:7,16. Either the first stage in<br>
 this trial or the previous trial and acquittal at the end of the<br>
 first Roman imprisonment. Probably the first view is correct,<br>
 though really there is no way to decide. <B>{No one took my part}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\oudeis moi paregeneto\)</i></b>. "No one came by my side" <b><i>(second<br>
 aorist middle indicative of \paraginomai\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->1Co 16:3. <B>{But<br>
 all forsook me}</B> <b><i>(\alla pantes me egkateleipon\)</i></b>. Same verb and<br>
 tense used of Demas above <b><i>(verse <!-#-->10)</i></b>, "But all were forsaking<br>
 me" <b><i>(one by one)</i></b> or, if aorist \egkatelipon\, "all at once left<br>
 me." <B>{May it not be laid to their account}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; autois<br>
 logisthei&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive optative in future wish with<br>
 negative \m&#275;\. Common Pauline verb \logizomai\ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 13:5; Ro<br>
 4:3,5)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:17 <B>{But the Lord stood by me}</B> <b><i>(\ho de kurios moi parest&#275;\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist active of \parist&#275;mi\ <b><i>(intransitive use)</i></b>, "took his<br>
 stand by my side." See <!-#-->Ro 16:2. Clearly Jesus appeared to Paul<br>
 now at this crisis and climax as he had done so many times<br>
 before. <B>{Strengthened me}</B> <b><i>(\enedunam&#333;sen me\)</i></b>. "Poured power into<br>
 me." See <!-#-->Php 4:13. <B>{That through me the message might be fully<br>
 proclaimed}</B> <b><i>(\hina di' emou to k&#275;rugma pl&#275;rophor&#275;th&#275;i\)</i></b>. Final<br>
 clause with \hina\ and first aorist passive subjunctive of<br>
 \pl&#275;rophore&#333;\ <b><i>(see verse <!-#-->5)</i></b>. Either to the rulers in Rome now<br>
 or, if the first imprisonment, by his release and going to Spain.<br>
 <B>{And that all the Gentiles might hear}</B> <b><i>(\kai akous&#333;sin panta ta<br>
 ethn&#275;\)</i></b>. Continuation of the purpose with the aorist active<br>
 subjunctive of \akou&#333;\. <B>{I was delivered out of the mouth of the<br>
 lion}</B> <b><i>(\erusth&#275;n ek stomatos leontos\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative of \ruomai\ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 1:10)</i></b>. A proverb, but not certain<br>
 what the application is whether to Nero or to Satan <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 2:18)</i></b><br>
 or to the lion in the arena where Paul could not be sent because<br>
 a Roman citizen.<br>
 <br>
 4:18 <B>{Will deliver me}</B> <b><i>(\rusetai me\)</i></b>. Future middle. Recall the<br>
 Lord's Prayer. Paul is not afraid of death. He will find his<br>
 triumph in death <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 1:21f.)</i></b>. <B>{Unto his heavenly kingdom}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n basileian autou t&#275;n epouranion\)</i></b>. The future life of<br>
 glory as in <!-#-->1Co 15:24,50. He will save <b><i>(\s&#333;sei\, effective<br>
 future)</i></b> me there finally and free from all evil. <B>{To whom be the<br>
 glory}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;i h&#275; doxa\)</i></b>. No verb in the Greek. Paul's final<br>
 doxology, his Swan Song, to Christ as in <!-#-->Ro 9:5; 16:27.<br>
 <br>
 4:19 <B>{Prisca and Aquila}</B> <b><i>(\Priscan kai Akulan\)</i></b>. Paul's friends<br>
 now back in Ephesus, no longer in Rome <b><i>(<!-#-->Rom 16:3)</i></b>. See <!-#-->1:16<br>
 for the house of Onesiphorus.<br>
 <br>
 4:20 <B>{Erastus}</B> <b><i>(\Erastos\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ac 19:22; Ro 16:23. <B>{Trophimus}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Trophimon\)</i></b>. A native of Ephesus and with Paul in Jerusalem<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:4; 21:29)</i></b>. <B>{At Miletus sick}</B> <b><i>(\en Mil&#275;t&#333;i asthenounta\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present active participle of \asthene&#333;\, to be weak. Probably on<br>
 Paul's return from Crete.<br>
 <br>
 4:21 <B>{Before winter}</B> <b><i>(\pro cheim&#333;nos\)</i></b>. Pathetic item if Paul was<br>
 now in the Mamertine Dungeon in Rome with winter coming on and<br>
 without his cloak for which he asked. How long he had been in<br>
 prison this time we do not know. He may even have spent the<br>
 previous winter or part of it here. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus,<br>
 Claudia are all unknown otherwise. Irenaeus does speak of Linus.<br>
 <B>{The Lord be with thy Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\ho kurios meta tou pneumatos<br>
 sou\)</i></b>. Let us hope that Timothy and Mark reached Paul before<br>
 winter, before the end came, with the cloak and with the books.<br>
 Our hero, we may be sure, met the end nobly. He is already more<br>
 than conqueror in Christ who is by his side and who will welcome<br>
 him to heaven and give him his crown. Luke, Timothy, Mark will do<br>
 all that mortal hands can do to cheer the heart of Paul with<br>
 human comfort. He already had the comfort of Christ in full<br>
 measure.<br>
