 <HR>
<p>4:1 <B>{Sat in the sea}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#275;sthai en t&#275;i thalass&#275;i\)</i></b>. In the<br>
 boat, of course, which was in the sea. He first sat by the beach<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 13:1)</i></b> and then a very great multitude <b><i>(\ochlos pleistos\)</i></b><br>
 made him enter a boat in which he sat and taught. It was a common<br>
 experience now to teach the crowds on the beach <b><i>(<!-#-->2:1,13;<br>
 3:7-9)</i></b>. <B>{There is gathered}</B> <b><i>(\sunagetai\)</i></b>. Graphic pictorial<br>
 present again. See the crowds pressing Jesus into the sea.<br>
 <br>
 4:2 <B>{He taught them}</B> <b><i>(\edidasken autous\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense<br>
 describing it as going on. <B>{In parables}</B> <b><i>(\en parabolais\)</i></b>. As in<br>
 <!-#-->3:23, only here more extended parables. See on &#175;Mt 13 for<br>
 discussion concerning Christ's use of parables. Eight are given<br>
 there, one 
<b><i>(the Lamp both in 
<!-#-->
Mr 4:21 and 
<!-#-->
Lu 8:16</i></b><b><i>(both Sower<br>
 and the Lamp in Luke)</i></b>, one alone in <!-#-->Mr 4:26-29 <b><i>(seed growing of<br>
 itself)</i></b> not in Matthew or Luke, ten on this occasion. Only four<br>
 are mentioned in <!-#-->Mr 4:1-34 <b><i>(The Sower, the Lamp, the Seed<br>
 Growing of Itself, the Mustard Seed)</i></b>. But Mark adds <b><i>(<!-#-->4:34)</i></b><br>
 "without a parable spake he not unto them," clearly meaning that<br>
 Jesus spoke many others on this occasion and Matt. after<br>
 mentioning eight <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 13:34)</i></b> makes the same statement.<br>
 Manifestly, therefore, Jesus spoke many parables on this day and<br>
 all theories of exegesis or dispensations on the basis of the<br>
 number of these kingdom parables are quite beside the mark. In<br>
 beginning Jesus said: <B>{Hearken}</B> <b><i>(\Akouete\)</i></b>. It is significant<br>
 that even Jesus had to ask people to listen when he spoke. See<br>
 also verse <!-#-->9.<br>
 <br>
 4:7 <B>{Choked}</B> <b><i>(\sunepnixan\)</i></b>. \Pnig&#333;\ means to strangle, throttle.<br>
 Mark has the compounded form with \sun-\, squeezed together. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 13:7 has \apepnixan\, <B>{choked off}</B>. <B>{Yielded no fruit}</B> <b><i>(\karpon<br>
 ouk ed&#333;kan\)</i></b>. In Mark alone. Barren in results.<br>
 <br>
 4:8 <B>{Growing up and increasing}</B> <b><i>(\anabainonta kai auxanomena\)</i></b>.<br>
 In Mark alone. A vivid detail enlarging on the continued growth<br>
 implied in the imperfect "yielded fruit" <b><i>(\edidou karpon\)</i></b>. It<br>
 kept on yielding as it grew. Fruit is what matters.<br>
 <br>
 4:10 <B>{When he was alone}</B> <b><i>(\hote egeneto kata monas\)</i></b>. Only in<br>
 Mark. Vivid recollection of Peter. Mark has also "they that were<br>
 about him with the twelve" <b><i>(\hoi peri auton sun tois d&#333;deka\)</i></b>,<br>
 Matthew and Luke simply "the disciples." They did not want the<br>
 multitude to see that they did not understand the teaching of<br>
 Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 4:11 <B>{Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Humin to must&#275;rion dedotai t&#275;s basileias tou theou\)</i></b>. See on<br>
 &#175;Mt 13:11 for word \must&#275;rion\. Here <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 4:11; Mt 13:11; Lu<br>
 8:10)</i></b> alone in the Gospels, but in Paul 21 times and in the<br>
 Revelation 4 times. It is frequent in Daniel and O.T. Apocrypha.<br>
 Matthew and Luke use it here in the plural. Matthew and Luke add<br>
 the word <B>{to know}</B> <b><i>(\gn&#333;nai\)</i></b>, but Mark's presentation covers a<br>
 wider range than growing knowledge, the permanent possession of<br>
 the mystery even before they understand it. The secret is no<br>
 longer hidden from the initiated. Discipleship means initiation<br>
 into the secret of God's kingdom and it will come gradually to<br>
 these men. <B>{But unto them that are without}</B> <b><i>(\ekeinois de tois<br>
 ex&#333;\)</i></b>. Peculiar to Mark, those outside our circle, the<br>
 uninitiated, the hostile group like the scribes and Pharisees,<br>
 who were charging Jesus with being in league with Beelzebub. <!-#-->Lu<br>
 8:10 has "to the rest" <b><i>(\tois loipois\)</i></b>, <!-#-->Mt 13:11 simply "to<br>
 them" <b><i>(\ekeinois\)</i></b>. Without the key the parables are hard to<br>
 understand, for parables veil the truth of the kingdom being<br>
 stated in terms of another realm. Without a spiritual truth and<br>
 insight they are unintelligible and are often today perverted.<br>
 The parables are thus a condemnation on the wilfully blind and<br>
 hostile, while a guide and blessing to the enlightened. <B>{That}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hina\)</i></b>. Mark has the construction of the Hebrew "lest" of <!-#-->Isa<br>
 6:9f. with the subjunctive and so <!-#-->Lu 8:10, while <!-#-->Mt 13:13<br>
 uses causal \hoti\ with the indicative following the LXX. See on<br>
 &#175;Mt 13:13 for the so-called causal use of \hina\. Gould on <!-#-->Mr<br>
 4:12 has an intelligent discussion of the differences between<br>
 Matthew and Mark and Luke. He argues that Mark here probably<br>
 "preserves the original form of Jesus' saying." God ironically<br>
 commands Isaiah to harden the hearts of the people. If the notion<br>
 of purpose is preserved in the use of \hina\ in Mark and Luke,<br>
 there is probably some irony also in the sad words of Jesus. If<br>
 \hina\ is given the causative use of \hoti\ in Matthew, the<br>
 difficulty disappears. What is certain is that the use of<br>
 parables on this occasion was a penalty for judicial blindness on<br>
 those who will not see.<br>
 <br>
 4:12 <B>{Lest haply they should turn again, and it should be<br>
 forgiven them}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;pote epistreps&#333;sin kai apheth&#275;i autois\)</i></b>. Luke<br>
 does not have these difficult words that seem in Isaiah to have<br>
 an ironical turn, though <!-#-->Mt 13:15 does retain them even after<br>
 using \hoti\ for the first part of the quotation. There is no way<br>
 to make \m&#275;pote\ in <!-#-->Mr 4:12 and <!-#-->Mt 13:15 have a causal sense.<br>
 It is the purpose of condemnation for wilful blindness and<br>
 rejection such as suits the Pharisees after their blasphemous<br>
 accusation against Jesus. Bengel says: _iam ante non videbant,<br>
 nunc accedit iudicium divinum_. Jesus is pronouncing their doom<br>
 in the language of Isaiah. It sounds like the dirge of the<br>
 damned.<br>
 <br>
 4:13 <B>{Know ye not this parable?}</B> <b><i>(\ouk oidate t&#275;n parabol&#275;n<br>
 tauten;\)</i></b>. They had asked Jesus his reasons for using parables.<br>
 This question implies surprise at their dulness though initiated<br>
 into the secret of God's Kingdom. Incapacity to comprehend this<br>
 parable of the sower raises doubt about all the others on this<br>
 day and at all times.<br>
 <br>
 4:14 <B>{The sower soweth the word}</B> <b><i>(\ho speir&#333;n ton logon<br>
 speirei\)</i></b>. Not put thus clearly and simply in <!-#-->Mt 13:19 or <!-#-->Lu<br>
 8:11.<br>
 <br>
 4:15 <B>{Where the word is sown}</B> <b><i>(\hopou speiretai ho logos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Explanatory detail only in Mark. <B>{Satan}</B> <b><i>(\Satan&#257;s\)</i></b> where <!-#-->Mt<br>
 13:19 has <B>{the evil one}</B> <b><i>(\ho pon&#275;ros\)</i></b> and <!-#-->Lu 8:12 <B>{the<br>
 devil}</B> <b><i>(\ho diabolos\)</i></b>. <B>{Sown in them}</B> <b><i>(\esparmenon eis autous\)</i></b>.<br>
 Within them, not just among them, "in his heart" <b><i>(Matt.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:19 <B>{The lusts of other things}</B> <b><i>(\hai peri ta loipa<br>
 epithumiai\)</i></b>. All the passions or longings, sensual, worldly,<br>
 "pleasures of this life" <b><i>(\h&#275;don&#333;n tou biou\)</i></b> as Luke has it <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 8:14)</i></b>, the world of sense drowning the world of spirit. The word<br>
 \epithumia\ is not evil in itself. One can yearn <b><i>(this word)</i></b> for<br>
 what is high and holy <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:15; Php 1:23)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:20 <B>{Bear fruit}</B> <b><i>(\karpophorousin\)</i></b>. Same word in <!-#-->Mt 13:23 and<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 8:15. Mark gives the order from thirty, sixty, to a hundred,<br>
 while <!-#-->Mt 13:23 has it reversed.<br>
 <br>
 4:21 <B>{Not to be put on the stand?}</B> <b><i>(\ouch hina epi t&#275;n luchnian<br>
 teth&#275;i;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive subjunctive of \tith&#275;mi\ with<br>
 \hina\ <b><i>(purpose)</i></b>. The lamp in the one-room house was a familiar<br>
 object along with the bushel, the bed, the lampstand. Note<br>
 article with each. \M&#275;ti\ in the Greek expects the answer no. It<br>
 is a curious instance of early textual corruption that both Aleph<br>
 and B, the two oldest and best documents, have \hupo t&#275;n<br>
 luchnian\ <b><i>(under the lampstand)</i></b> instead of \epi t&#275;n luchnian\,<br>
 making shipwreck of the sense. Westcott and Hort actually put it<br>
 in the margin but that is sheer slavery to Aleph and B. Some of<br>
 the crisp sayings were repeated by Jesus on other occasions as<br>
 shown in Matthew and Luke. To put the lamp under the bushel<br>
 <b><i>(\modion\)</i></b> would put it out besides giving no light. So as to the<br>
 bed or table-couch <b><i>(\klin&#275;n\)</i></b> if it was raised above the floor<br>
 and liable to be set on fire.<br>
 <br>
 4:22 <B>{Save that it should be manifested}</B> <b><i>(\ean m&#275; hina<br>
 phaner&#333;th&#275;i\)</i></b>. Note \ean m&#275;\ and \hina\. <!-#-->Lu 8:17 has it <B>{that<br>
 shall not be made manifest}</B> <b><i>(\ho ou phaneron gen&#275;setai\)</i></b>. Here in<br>
 Mark it is stated that the temporary concealment is for final<br>
 manifestation and a means to that end. Those who are charged with<br>
 the secret at this time are given the set responsibility of<br>
 proclaiming it on the housetops after Ascension <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>. The<br>
 hidden <b><i>(\krupton\)</i></b> and the <B>{secret}</B> <b><i>(\apokruphon\)</i></b> are to be<br>
 revealed in due time.<br>
 <br>
 4:23 Repeats verse <!-#-->9 with conditional form instead of a<br>
 relative clause. Perhaps some inattention was noted.<br>
 <br>
 4:24 <B>{What ye hear}</B> <b><i>(\ti akouete\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu 8:18 has it "how ye<br>
 hear" <b><i>(\p&#333;s akouete\)</i></b> . Both are important. Some things should<br>
 not be heard at all for they besmirch the mind and heart. What is<br>
 worth hearing should be heard rightly and heeded. <B>{With what<br>
 measure}</B> <b><i>(\en h&#333;i metr&#333;i\)</i></b>. See already in the Sermon on the<br>
 Mount <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 7:2; Lu 6:38)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:25 <B>{Even that which he hath}</B> <b><i>(\kai ho echei\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu 8:18 has<br>
 <B>{even that which he thinketh that he hath or seemeth to have}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai ho dokei echein\)</i></b>. It is possible that \echei\ here has the<br>
 notion of acquiring. The man who does not acquire soon loses what<br>
 he thinks that he has. This is one of the paradoxes of Jesus that<br>
 repay thought and practice.<br>
 <br>
 4:26 <B>{As if a man should cast}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s anthr&#333;pos bal&#275;i\)</i></b>. Note<br>
 \h&#333;s\ with the aorist subjunctive without \an\. It is a<br>
 supposable case and so the subjunctive and the aorist tense<br>
 because a single instance. Blass considers this idiom "quite<br>
 impossible," but it is the true text here and makes good sense<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 968)</i></b>. The more common idiom would have<br>
 been \h&#333;s ean\ <b><i>(or \an\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:27 <B>{Should sleep and rise}</B> <b><i>(\katheud&#275;i kai egeir&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 subjunctive for continued action. So also <B>{spring up and grow}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\blast&#257;i kai m&#275;kun&#275;tai\)</i></b> two late verbs. The process of growth<br>
 goes on all night and all day <b><i>(\nukta kai h&#275;meran\, accusative of<br>
 time)</i></b>. <B>{He knoweth not how}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s ouk oiden autos\)</i></b>. Note<br>
 position of \h&#333;s\ <b><i>(beginning)</i></b> and \autos\ <b><i>(end)</i></b> of clause: <B>{How<br>
 knows not he}</B>. The mystery of growth still puzzles farmers and<br>
 scientists of today with all our modern knowledge. But nature's<br>
 secret processes do not fail to operate because we are ignorant.<br>
 This secret and mysterious growth of the kingdom in the heart and<br>
 life is the point of this beautiful parable given only by Mark.<br>
 "When man has done his part, the actual process of growth is<br>
 beyond his reach or comprehension" <b><i>(Swete)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:28 <B>{Of herself}</B> <b><i>(\automat&#275;\)</i></b>. Automatically, we say. The secret<br>
 of growth is in the seed, not in the soil nor in the weather nor<br>
 in the cultivating. These all help, but the seed spontaneously<br>
 works according to its own nature. The word \automat&#275;\ is from<br>
 \autos\ <b><i>(self)</i></b> and \memaa\ desire eagerly from obsolete \ma&#333;\.<br>
 Common word in all Greek history. Only one other example in N.T.,<br>
 in <!-#-->Ac 12:10 when the city gate opens to Peter of its own<br>
 accord. "The mind is adapted to the truth, as the eye to the<br>
 light" <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>. So we sow the seed, God's kingdom truth, and the<br>
 soil <b><i>(the soul)</i></b> is ready for the seed. The Holy Spirit works on<br>
 the heart and uses the seed sown and makes it germinate and grow,<br>
 "first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear"<br>
 <b><i>(\pr&#333;ton chorton, eiten stachun, eiten pl&#275;r&#275; siton en t&#333;i<br>
 stachui\)</i></b>. This is the law and order of nature and also of grace<br>
 in the kingdom of God. Hence it is worth while to preach and<br>
 teach. "This single fact creates the confidence shown by Jesus in<br>
 the ultimate establishment of his kingdom in spite of the<br>
 obstacles which obstruct its progress" <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:29 <B>{Is ripe}</B> <b><i>(\paradoi\, second aorist subjunctive with<br>
 \hotan\)</i></b>. Whenever the fruit yields itself or permits. <B>{Putteth<br>
 forth}</B> <b><i>(\apostellei\)</i></b>. Sends forth the sickle. The word for<br>
 _apostle_ comes from this verb. See <!-#-->Joh 4:38: "I sent you forth<br>
 to reap" <b><i>(\ego apesteila hum&#257;s therizein\)</i></b>. Sickle <b><i>(\drepanon\)</i></b><br>
 here by metonymy stands for the reapers who use it when the<br>
 harvest stands ready for it <b><i>(\parest&#275;ken\, stands by the side,<br>
 present perfect indicative)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:30 <B>{How shall we liken?}</B> <b><i>(\P&#333;s homoi&#333;s&#333;men?\)</i></b> Deliberative<br>
 first aorist subjunctive. This question alone in Mark. So with<br>
 the other question: <B>{In what parable shall we set it forth?}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 tini aut&#275;n parabol&#275;i th&#333;men;\)</i></b>. Deliberative second aorist<br>
 subjunctive. The graphic question draws the interest of the<br>
 hearers <b><i>(_we_)</i></b> by fine tact. <!-#-->Lu 13:18f. retains the double<br>
 question which <!-#-->Mt 13:31f. does not have, though he has it in a<br>
 very different context, probably an illustration of Christ's<br>
 favourite sayings often repeated to different audiences as is<br>
 true of all teachers and preachers.<br>
 <br>
 4:31 <B>{When it is sown}</B> <b><i>(\hotan spar&#275;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive<br>
 subjunctive of \speir&#333;\. Alone in Mark and repeated in verse<br>
 <!-#-->32. <B>{Less than all the seeds}</B> <b><i>(\mikroteron pant&#333;n t&#333;n<br>
 spermat&#333;n\)</i></b>. Comparative adjective with the ablative case after<br>
 it. Hyperbole, of course, but clearly meaning that from a very<br>
 small seed a large plant grows, the gradual pervasive expansive<br>
 power of the kingdom of God.<br>
 <br>
 4:32 <B>{Groweth up}</B> <b><i>(\anabainei\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 13:32 <B>{When it is grown}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hotan aux&#275;th&#275;i\)</i></b>. <B>{Under the shadow thereof}</B> <b><i>(\hupo t&#275;n skian<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. A different picture from Matthew's <B>{in the branches<br>
 thereof}</B> <b><i>(\en tois kladois autou\)</i></b>. But both use \katask&#275;noin\,<br>
 to tent or camp down, make nests in the branches in the shade or<br>
 hop on the ground under the shade just like a covey of birds. In<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 8:20 the birds have nests <b><i>(\katask&#275;n&#333;seis\)</i></b>. The use of the<br>
 mustard seed for smallness seems to have been proverbial and<br>
 Jesus employs it elsewhere <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 17:20; Lu 17:6)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 4:33 <B>{As they were able to hear it}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s &#275;dunanto akouein\)</i></b>.<br>
 Only in Mark. Imperfect indicative. See <!-#-->Joh 16:12 for \ou<br>
 dunasthe bastazein\, not able to bear. Jesus used parables now<br>
 largely, but there was a limit even to the use of them to these<br>
 men. He gave them the mystery of the kingdom in this veiled<br>
 parabolic form which was the only feasible form at this stage.<br>
 But even so they did not understand what they heard.<br>
 <br>
 4:34 <B>{But privately to his disciples he expounded all things}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kat' idian de tois idiois math&#275;tais epeluen panta\)</i></b>. To his own<br>
 <b><i>(\idiois\)</i></b> disciples in private, in distinction from the mass of<br>
 the people Jesus was in the habit <b><i>(imperfect tense, \epeluen\)</i></b> of<br>
 <B>{disclosing}</B>, revealing, all things <b><i>(\panta\)</i></b> in plain language<br>
 without the parabolic form used before the crowds. This verb<br>
 \epilu&#333;\ occurs in the N.T. only here and in <!-#-->Ac 19:39 where the<br>
 town-clerk of Ephesus says of the troubles by the mob: "It shall<br>
 be settled in the regular assembly" <b><i>(\en t&#275;i ennom&#333;i ekkl&#275;si&#257;i<br>
 epiluth&#275;setai\)</i></b>. First future passive indicative from \epilu&#333;\.<br>
 The word means to give additional <b><i>(\epi\)</i></b> loosening <b><i>(\lu&#333;\)</i></b>, so<br>
 to explain, to make plainer, clearer, even to the point of<br>
 revelation. This last is the idea of the substantive in <!-#-->2Pe<br>
 1:20 where even the Revised Version has it: "No prophecy of<br>
 scripture is of private interpretation" <b><i>(\p&#257;sa proph&#275;teia graph&#275;s<br>
 idias epiluse&#333;s ou ginetai\)</i></b>. Here the use of \ginetai\ <b><i>(comes)</i></b><br>
 with the ablative case <b><i>(\epiluse&#333;s\)</i></b> and the explanation given in<br>
 verse <!-#-->2Pe 1:21 shows plainly that disclosure or revelation to<br>
 the prophet is what is meant, not interpretation of what the<br>
 prophet said. The prophetic impulse and message came from God<br>
 through the Holy Spirit. In private the further disclosures of<br>
 Jesus amounted to fresh revelations concerning the mysteries of<br>
 the kingdom of God.<br>
 <br>
 4:35 <B>{When even was come}</B> <b><i>(\opsias genomen&#275;s\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute. It had been a busy day. The blasphemous accusation, the<br>
 visit of the mother and brothers and possibly sisters, to take<br>
 him home, leaving the crowded house for the sea, the first<br>
 parables by the sea, then more in the house, and now out of the<br>
 house and over the sea. <B>{Let us go over unto the other side}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dielth&#333;men eis to peran\)</i></b>. Hortatory <b><i>(volitive)</i></b> subjunctive,<br>
 second aorist active tense. They were on the western side and a<br>
 row over to the eastern shore in the evening would be a<br>
 delightful change and refreshing to the weary Christ. It was the<br>
 only way to escape the crowds.<br>
 <br>
 4:36 <B>{Even as he was}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s &#275;n\)</i></b>. Vulgate, _ita ut erat_. Bengel<br>
 says: _sine apparatu_. That is, they take Jesus along<br>
 <b><i>(\paralambanousin\)</i></b> without previous preparation. <B>{Other boats}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\alla ploia\)</i></b>. This detail also is given only by Mark. Some<br>
 people had got into boats to get close to Jesus. There was a<br>
 crowd even on the lake.<br>
 <br>
 4:37 <B>{There ariseth a great storm of wind}</B> <b><i>(\ginetai lailaps<br>
 megal&#275; anemou\)</i></b>. Mark's vivid historical present again. <!-#-->Mt 8:24<br>
 has \egeneto\ <b><i>(arose)</i></b> and <!-#-->Lu 8:23 \kateb&#275;\ <b><i>(came down)</i></b>. Luke<br>
 has also \lailaps\, but Matthew \seismos\ <b><i>(tempest)</i></b>, a violent<br>
 upheaval like an earthquake. \Lailaps\ is an old word for these<br>
 cyclonic gusts or storms. Luke's "came down" shows that the storm<br>
 fell suddenly from Mount Hermon down into the Jordan Valley and<br>
 smote the Sea of Galilee violently at its depth of 682 feet below<br>
 the Mediterranean Sea. The hot air at this depth draws the storm<br>
 down with sudden power. These sudden storms continue to this day<br>
 on the Sea of Galilee. The word occurs in the LXX of the<br>
 whirlwind out of which God answered Job <b><i>(<!-#-->Job 38:1)</i></b> and in <!-#-->Jon<br>
 1:4. <B>{The waves beat into the boat}</B> <b><i>(\ta kumata epeballen eis to<br>
 ploion\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense <b><i>(were beating)</i></b> vividly picturing the<br>
 rolling over the sides of the boat "so that the boat was covered<br>
 with the waves" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 8:24)</i></b>. Mark has it: "insomuch that the boat<br>
 was now filling" <b><i>(\h&#333;ste &#275;d&#275; gemizesthai to ploion\)</i></b>. Graphic<br>
 description of the plight of the disciples.<br>
 <br>
 4:38 <B>{Asleep on the cushion}</B> <b><i>(\epi to proskephalaion katheud&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Mark also mentions the cushion or bolster and the stern of the<br>
 boat <b><i>(\en t&#275;i prumn&#275;i\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 8:24 notes that Jesus was sleeping<br>
 <b><i>(\ekatheuden\)</i></b>, Luke that <B>{he fell asleep}</B> <b><i>(\aphupn&#333;sen\,<br>
 ingressive aorist indicative)</i></b>. He was worn out from the toil of<br>
 this day. <B>{They awake him}</B> <b><i>(\egeirousin auton\)</i></b>. So Mark's<br>
 graphic present. Matthew and Luke both have "awoke him." Mark has<br>
 also what the others do not: "Carest thou not?" <b><i>(\ou melei<br>
 soi;\)</i></b>. It was a rebuke to Jesus for sleeping in such a storm. We<br>
 are perishing <b><i>(\apollumetha\, linear present middle)</i></b>. Precisely<br>
 this same form also in <!-#-->Mt 8:25 and <!-#-->Lu 8:24.<br>
 <br>
 4:39 <B>{Rebuked the wind}</B> <b><i>(\epetim&#275;sen t&#333;i anem&#333;i\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Mt 8:26<br>
 and <!-#-->Lu 8:24. He spoke to the sea also. All three Gospels speak<br>
 of the sudden calm <b><i>(\gal&#275;n&#275;\)</i></b> and the rebuke to the disciples for<br>
 this lack of faith.<br>
 <br>
 4:40 <B>{Why are ye fearful?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti deiloi este;\)</i></b>. They had the Lord<br>
 of the wind and the waves with them in the boat. He was still<br>
 Master even if asleep in the storm. <B>{Have ye not yet faith?}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Oup&#333; echete pistin;\)</i></b>. Not yet had they come to feel that Jesus<br>
 was really Lord of nature. They had accepted his Messiaship, but<br>
 all the conclusions from it they had not yet drawn. How like us<br>
 in our troubles they were!<br>
 <br>
 4:41 <B>{They feared exceedingly}</B> <b><i>(\ephob&#275;th&#275;san phobon megan\)</i></b>.<br>
 Cognate accusative with the first aorist passive indicative. They<br>
 feared a great fear. <!-#-->Mt 8:27 and <!-#-->Lu 8:22 mention that "they<br>
 marvelled." But there was fear in it also. <B>{Who then is this?}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Tis ara houtos estin;\)</i></b>. No wonder that they feared if this One<br>
 could command the wind and the waves at will as well as demons<br>
 and drive out all diseases and speak such mysteries in parables.<br>
 They were growing in their apprehension and comprehension of<br>
 Jesus Christ. They had much yet to learn. There is much yet for<br>
 us today to learn or seek to grow in the knowledge of our Lord<br>
 Jesus Christ. This incident opened the eyes and minds of the<br>
 disciples to the majesty of Jesus.<br>
