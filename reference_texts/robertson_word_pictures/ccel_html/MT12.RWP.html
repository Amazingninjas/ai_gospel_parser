<p>12:1 <B>{On the sabbath day through the cornfields}</B> <b><i>(\tois sabbasin<br>
 dia t&#333;n sporim&#333;n\)</i></b>. This paragraph begins exactly like <!-#-->11:25<br>
 "at that season" <b><i>(\en ekein&#333;i t&#333;i kair&#333;i\)</i></b>, a general statement<br>
 with no clear idea of time. So also <!-#-->14:1. The word \kairos\<br>
 means a definite and particular time, but we cannot fix it. The<br>
 word "cornfields" does not mean our maize or Indian corn, but<br>
 simply fields of grain <b><i>(wheat or even barley)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:2 <B>{Thy disciples do}</B> <b><i>(\hoi math&#275;tai sou poiousin\)</i></b>. These<br>
 critics are now watching a chance and they jump at this violation<br>
 of their Pharisaic rules for Sabbath observance. The disciples<br>
 were plucking the heads of wheat which to the Pharisees was<br>
 reaping and were rubbing them in their hands <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:1)</i></b> which was<br>
 threshing.<br>
 <br>
 12:3 <B>{What David did}</B> <b><i>(\ti epoi&#275;sen Daueid\)</i></b>. From the necessity<br>
 of hunger. The first defence made by Christ appeals to the<br>
 conduct of David <b><i>(<!-#-->2Sa 21:6)</i></b>. David and those with him did "what<br>
 was not lawful" <b><i>(\ho ouk exon &#275;n\)</i></b> precisely the charge made<br>
 against the disciples <b><i>(\ho ouk exestin\ in verse <!-#-->2)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:6 <B>{One greater than the temple}</B> <b><i>(\tou hierou meizon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Ablative of comparison, \tou hierou\. The Textus Receptus has<br>
 \meiz&#333;n\, but the neuter is correct. Literally, "something<br>
 greater than the temple." What is that? It may still be Christ,<br>
 or it may be: "The work and His disciples were of more account<br>
 than the temple" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. "If the temple was not subservient to<br>
 Sabbath rules, how much less the Messiah!" <b><i>(Allen)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:7 <B>{The guiltless}</B> <b><i>(\tous anaitious\)</i></b>. So in verse <!-#-->5. Common<br>
 in ancient Greek. No real ground against, it means \an\ +<br>
 \aitios\. Jesus quotes <!-#-->Ho 6:6 here as he did in <!-#-->Mt 9:13. A<br>
 pertinent prophecy that had escaped the notice of the sticklers<br>
 for ceremonial literalness and the letter of the law.<br>
 <br>
 12:9 <B>{Lord of the Sabbath}</B> <b><i>(\kurios tou sabbatou\)</i></b>. This claim<br>
 that he as the Son of Man is master of the Sabbath and so above<br>
 the Pharisaic regulations angered them extremely. By the phrase<br>
 "the Son of man" here Jesus involves the claim of Messiahship,<br>
 but as the Representative Man he affirms his solidarity with<br>
 mankind, "standing for the human interest" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b> on this<br>
 subject.<br>
 <br>
 12:10 <B>{Is it lawful?}</B> <b><i>(\ei exestin\)</i></b>. The use of \ei\ in direct<br>
 questions is really elliptical and seems an imitation of the<br>
 Hebrew <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 916)</i></b>. See also <!-#-->Mt 19:3. It is<br>
 not translated in English.<br>
 <br>
 12:12 <B>{How much then is a man}</B> <b><i>(\pos&#333;i oun diapherei anthr&#333;pos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Another of Christ's pregnant questions that goes to the roots of<br>
 things, an _a fortiori_ argument. "By how much does a human being<br>
 differ from a sheep? That is the question which Christian<br>
 civilization has not even yet adequately answered" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. The<br>
 poor pettifogging Pharisees are left in the pit.<br>
 <br>
 12:13 <B>{Stretch forth thy hand}</B> <b><i>(\ekteinon sou t&#275;n cheira\)</i></b>.<br>
 Probably the arm was not withered, though that is not certain.<br>
 But he did the impossible. "He stretched it forth," straight, I<br>
 hope, towards the Pharisees who were watching Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 3:2)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:14 <B>{Took counsel against him}</B> <b><i>(\sumboulion elabon kat'<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. An imitation of the Latin _concilium capere_ and found<br>
 in papyri of the second century A.D. <b><i>(Deissmann, _Bible Studies_,<br>
 p. 238.)</i></b> This incident marks a crisis in the hatred of the<br>
 Pharisees toward Jesus. They bolted out of the synagogue and<br>
 actually conspired with their hated rivals, the Herodians, how to<br>
 put Jesus to death <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 3:6; Mt 12:14; Lu 6:11)</i></b>. By "destroy"<br>
 <b><i>(\apoles&#333;sin\)</i></b> they meant "kill."<br>
 <br>
 12:15 <B>{Perceiving}</B> <b><i>(\gnous\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of<br>
 \gin&#333;sk&#333;\. Jesus read their very thoughts. They were now plain to<br>
 any one who saw their angry countenances.<br>
 <br>
 12:17 <B>{That it might be fulfilled}</B> <b><i>(\hina pl&#275;r&#333;th&#275;i\)</i></b>. The final<br>
 use of \hina\ and the sub-final just before <b><i>(verse <!-#-->16)</i></b>. The<br>
 passage quoted is <!-#-->Isa 42:1-4 "a very free reproduction of the<br>
 Hebrew with occasional side glances at the Septuagint" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>,<br>
 possibly from an Aramaic collection of _Testimonia_ <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 Matthew applies the prophecy about Cyrus to Christ.<br>
 <br>
 12:18 <B>{My beloved}</B> <b><i>(\ho agap&#275;tos mou\)</i></b>. This phrase reminds one<br>
 of <!-#-->Mt 3:17 <b><i>(the Father's words at Christ's baptism)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:20 <B>{A bruised reed}</B> <b><i>(\kalamon suntetrimmenon\)</i></b>. Perfect<br>
 passive participle of \suntrib&#333;\. A crushed reed he will not<br>
 break. The curious augment in \kateaxei\ <b><i>(future active<br>
 indicative)</i></b> is to be noted. The copyists kept the augment where<br>
 it did not belong in this verb <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1212)</i></b><br>
 even in Plato. "Smoking flax" <b><i>(\linon tuphomenon\)</i></b>. The wick of a<br>
 lamp, smoking and flickering and going out. Only here in N.T.<br>
 Flax in <!-#-->Ex 9:31. Vivid images that picture Jesus in the same<br>
 strain as his own great words in <!-#-->Mt 11:28-30.<br>
 <br>
 12:23 <B>{Is this the Son of David?}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;ti houtos estin ho huios<br>
 Daueid?\)</i></b>. The form of the question expects the answer "no," but<br>
 they put it so because of the Pharisaic hostility towards Jesus.<br>
 The multitudes "were amazed" or "stood out of themselves"<br>
 <b><i>(\existanto\)</i></b>, imperfect tense, vividly portraying the situation.<br>
 They were almost beside themselves with excitement.<br>
 <br>
 12:24 <B>{The Pharisees}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de Pharisaioi\)</i></b>. Already <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 9:32-34)</i></b> we have had in Matthew the charge that Jesus is in<br>
 league with the prince of demons, though the incident may be<br>
 later than this one. See on &#175;10:25 about "Beelzebub." The<br>
 Pharisees feel that the excited condition of the crowds and the<br>
 manifest disposition to believe that Jesus is the Messiah <b><i>(the<br>
 Son of David)</i></b> demand strenuous action on their part. They cannot<br>
 deny the fact of the miracles for the blind and dumb men both saw<br>
 and spoke <b><i>(<!-#-->12:22)</i></b>. So in desperation they suggest that Jesus<br>
 works by the power of Beelzebub the prince of the demons.<br>
 <br>
 12:25 <B>{Knowing their thoughts}</B> <b><i>(\eid&#333;s de tas enthum&#275;seis<br>
 aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. What they were revolving in their minds. They now find<br>
 out what a powerful opponent Jesus is. By parables, by a series<br>
 of conditions <b><i>(first class)</i></b>, by sarcasm, by rhetorical question,<br>
 by merciless logic, he lays bare their hollow insincerity and the<br>
 futility of their arguments. Satan does not cast out Satan. Note<br>
 timeless aorist passive \emeristh&#275;\ in <!-#-->26, \ephthasen\ in <!-#-->28<br>
 <b><i>(simple sense of arriving as in <!-#-->Php 3:16 from \phthan&#333;\)</i></b>.<br>
 Christ is engaged in deathless conflict with Satan the strong man<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->29)</i></b>. "Goods" <b><i>(\skeu&#275;\)</i></b> means house-gear, house furniture, or<br>
 equipment as in <!-#-->Lu 17:36 and <!-#-->Ac 27:17, the tackling of the<br>
 ship.<br>
 <br>
 12:30 <B>{He that is not with me}</B> <b><i>(\ho m&#275; &#333;n met' emou\)</i></b>. With these<br>
 solemn words Jesus draws the line of cleavage between himself and<br>
 his enemies then and now. Jesus still has his enemies who hate<br>
 him and all noble words and deeds because they sting what<br>
 conscience they have into fury. But we may have our choice. We<br>
 either gather with <b><i>(\sunag&#333;n\)</i></b> Christ or scatter <b><i>(\skorpizei\)</i></b> to<br>
 the four winds. Christ is the magnet of the ages. He draws or<br>
 drives away. "Satan is the arch-waster, Christ the collector,<br>
 Saviour" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:31 <B>{But the blasphemy against the Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; de tou<br>
 pneumatos blasph&#275;mia\)</i></b>. Objective genitive. This is the<br>
 unpardonable sin. In <!-#-->32 we have \kata tou pneumatos tou hagiou\<br>
 to make it plainer. What is the blasphemy against the Holy<br>
 Spirit? These Pharisees had already committed it. They had<br>
 attributed the works of the Holy Spirit by whose power Jesus<br>
 wrought his miracles <b><i>(<!-#-->12:28)</i></b> to the devil. That sin was without<br>
 excuse and would not be forgiven in their age or in the coming<br>
 one <b><i>(<!-#-->12:32)</i></b>. People often ask if they can commit the<br>
 unpardonable sin. Probably some do who ridicule the manifest work<br>
 of God's Spirit in men's lives and attribute the Spirit's work to<br>
 the devil.<br>
 <br>
 12:34 <B>{Ye offspring of vipers}</B> <b><i>(\genn&#275;mata echidn&#333;n\)</i></b>. These same<br>
 terrible words the Baptist had used to the Pharisees and<br>
 Sadducees who came to his baptism <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 3:7)</i></b>. But these Pharisees<br>
 had deliberately made their choice and had taken Satan's side.<br>
 The charge against Jesus of being in league with Satan reveals<br>
 the evil heart within. The heart "spurts out" <b><i>(\ekballei\)</i></b> good<br>
 or evil according to the supply <b><i>(treasure, \th&#275;saurou\)</i></b> within.<br>
 Verse <!-#-->33 is like <!-#-->Mt 7:17-19. Jesus often repeated his crisp<br>
 pungent sayings as every teacher does.<br>
 <br>
 12:36 <B>{Every idle word}</B> <b><i>(\pan rh&#275;ma argon\)</i></b>. An ineffective,<br>
 useless word <b><i>(\a\ privative and \ergon\)</i></b>. A word that does no<br>
 good and so is pernicious like pernicious anaemia. It is a solemn<br>
 thought. Jesus who knows our very thoughts <b><i>(<!-#-->12:25)</i></b> insists that<br>
 our words reveal our thoughts and form a just basis for the<br>
 interpretation of character <b><i>(<!-#-->12:37)</i></b>. Here we have judgment by<br>
 words as in <!-#-->25:31-46 where Jesus presents judgment by deeds.<br>
 Both are real tests of actual character. Homer spoke of "winged<br>
 words" <b><i>(\pteroenta epea\)</i></b>. And by the radio our words can be<br>
 heard all round the earth. Who knows where they stop?<br>
 <br>
 12:38 <B>{A sign from thee}</B> <b><i>(\apo sou s&#275;meion\)</i></b>. One wonders at the<br>
 audacity of scribes and Pharisees who accused Jesus of being in<br>
 league with Satan and thus casting out demons who can turn round<br>
 and blandly ask for a "sign from thee." As if the other miracles<br>
 were not signs! "The demand was impudent, hypocritical,<br>
 insulting" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:39 <B>{An evil and adulterous generation}</B> <b><i>(\genea pon&#275;ra kai<br>
 moichalis\)</i></b>. They had broken the marriage tie which bound them to<br>
 Jehovah <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ps 73:27; Isa 57:3ff.; 62:5; Eze 23:27;<br>
 Jas 4:4; Re 2:20. What is "the sign of Jonah?"<br>
 <br>
 12:40 <B>{The whale}</B> <b><i>(\tou k&#275;tous\)</i></b>. Sea-monster, huge fish. In <!-#-->Jon<br>
 2:1 the LXX has \k&#275;tei megal&#333;i\. "Three days and three nights"<br>
 may simply mean three days in popular speech. Jesus rose "on the<br>
 third day" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 16:21)</i></b>, not "on the fourth day." It is just a<br>
 fuller form for "after three days" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 8:31; 10:34)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:41 <B>{In the judgment}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i krisei\)</i></b>. Except here and in the<br>
 next verse Matthew has "day of judgment" <b><i>(\h&#275;mera krise&#333;s\)</i></b> as in<br>
 <!-#-->10:15; 11:22,24; 12:36. Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 10:14)</i></b> has \en t&#275;i krisei\.<br>
 <B>{They repented at the preaching of Jonah}</B> <b><i>(\meteno&#275;son eis to<br>
 k&#275;rugma I&#333;na\)</i></b>. Note this use of \eis\ just like \en\. Note also<br>
 \pleion\ <b><i>(neuter)</i></b>, not \plei&#333;n\ <b><i>(masc.)</i></b>. See the same idiom in<br>
 <!-#-->12:6 and <!-#-->12:48. Jesus is something greater than the temple,<br>
 than Jonah, than Solomon. "You will continue to disbelieve in<br>
 spite of all I can say or do, and at last you will put me to<br>
 death. But I will rise again, a sign for your confusion, if not<br>
 for your conversion" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 12:44 <B>{Into my house}</B> <b><i>(\eis ton oikon mou\)</i></b>. So the demon<br>
 describes the man in whom he had dwelt. "The demon is ironically<br>
 represented as implying that he left his victim voluntarily, as a<br>
 man leaves his house to go for a walk" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. "Worse than the<br>
 first" is a proverb.<br>
 <br>
 12:46 <B>{His mother and his brothers}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; m&#275;t&#275;r kai hoi adelphoi<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. Brothers of Jesus, younger sons of Joseph and Mary. The<br>
 charge of the Pharisees that Jesus was in league with Satan was<br>
 not believed by the disciples of Jesus, but some of his friends<br>
 did think that he was beside himself <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 3:21)</i></b> because of the<br>
 excitement and strain. It was natural for Mary to want to take<br>
 him home for rest and refreshment. So the mother and brothers are<br>
 pictured standing outside the house <b><i>(or the crowd)</i></b>. They send a<br>
 messenger to Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 12:47 Aleph, B, L, Old Syriac, omit this verse as do Westcott and<br>
 Hort. It is genuine in <!-#-->Mr 3:32; Lu 8:20. It was probably copied<br>
 into Matthew from Mark or Luke.<br>
 <br>
 12:49 <B>{Behold my mother and my brothers}</B> <b><i>(\idou h&#275; m&#275;t&#275;r mou kai<br>
 hoi adelphoi mou\)</i></b>. A dramatic wave of the hand towards his<br>
 disciples <b><i>(learners)</i></b> accompanied these words. Jesus loved his<br>
 mother and brothers, but they were not to interfere in his<br>
 Messianic work. The real spiritual family of Jesus included all<br>
 who follow him. But it was hard for Mary to go back to Nazareth<br>
 and leave Jesus with the excited throng so great that he was not<br>
 even stopping to eat <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 3:20)</i></b>.<br>
