<p>15:1 <B>{All the publicans and sinners}</B> <b><i>(\pantes hoi tel&#333;nai kai hoi<br>
 hamart&#333;loi\)</i></b>. The two articles separate the two classes <b><i>(all the<br>
 publicans and the sinners)</i></b>. They are sometimes grouped together<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->5:30; Mt 9:11)</i></b>, but not here. The publicans are put on the<br>
 same level with the outcasts or sinners. So in verse <!-#-->2 the<br>
 repeated article separates Pharisees and scribes as not quite<br>
 one. The use of "all" here may be hyperbole for very many or the<br>
 reference may be to these two classes in the particular place<br>
 where Jesus was from time to time. <B>{Were drawing near unto him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;san aut&#333;i eggizontes\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect of \eggiz&#333;\,<br>
 from \eggus\ <b><i>(near)</i></b>, late verb. <B>{For to hear}</B> <b><i>(\akouein\)</i></b>. Just<br>
 the present active infinitive of purpose.<br>
 <br>
 15:2 <B>{Both ... and}</B> <b><i>(\te ... kai\)</i></b>. United in the complaint.<br>
 <B>{Murmured}</B> <b><i>(\diegogguzon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \diagogguz&#333;\,<br>
 late Greek compound in the LXX and Byzantine writers. In the N.T.<br>
 only here and <!-#-->Lu 19:7. The force of \dia\ here is probably<br>
 between or among themselves. It spread <b><i>(imperfect tense)</i></b> whenever<br>
 these two classes came in contact with Jesus. As the publicans<br>
 and the sinners were drawing near to Jesus just in that<br>
 proportion the Pharisees and the scribes increased their<br>
 murmurings. The social breach is here an open yawning chasm.<br>
 <B>{This man}</B> <b><i>(\houtos\)</i></b>. A contemptuous sneer in the use of the<br>
 pronoun. They spoke out openly and probably pointed at Jesus.<br>
 <B>{Receiveth}</B> <b><i>(\prosdechetai\)</i></b>. Present middle indicative of the<br>
 common verb \prosdechomai\. In <!-#-->12:36 we had it for expecting,<br>
 here it is to give access to oneself, to welcome like<br>
 \hupedexato\ of Martha's welcome to Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 10:38)</i></b>. The<br>
 charge here is that this is the habit of Jesus. He shows no sense<br>
 of social superiority to these outcasts <b><i>(like the Hindu<br>
 "untouchables" in India)</i></b>. <B>{And eateth with them}</B> <b><i>(\kai sunesthiei<br>
 autois\)</i></b>. Associative instrumental case <b><i>(\autois\)</i></b> after \sun-\<br>
 in composition. This is an old charge <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 5:30)</i></b> and a much more<br>
 serious breach from the standpoint of the Pharisees. The<br>
 implication is that Jesus prefers these outcasts to the<br>
 respectable classes <b><i>(the Pharisees and the scribes)</i></b> because he is<br>
 like them in character and tastes, even with the harlots. There<br>
 was a sting in the charge that he was the "friend" <b><i>(\philos\)</i></b> of<br>
 publicans and sinners <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 7:34)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:3 <B>{This parable}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n parabol&#275;n taut&#275;n\)</i></b>. The Parable of the<br>
 Lost Sheep <b><i>(<!-#-->15:3-7)</i></b>. This is Christ's way of answering the<br>
 cavilling of these chronic complainers. Jesus gave this same<br>
 parable for another purpose in another connection <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 18:12-14)</i></b>. The figure of the Good Shepherd appears also in <!-#-->Joh<br>
 10:1-18. "No simile has taken more hold upon the mind of<br>
 Christendom" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. Jesus champions the lost and accepts the<br>
 challenge and justifies his conduct by these superb stories. "The<br>
 three Episodes form a climax: The Pasture--the House--the Home;<br>
 the Herdsman--the Housewife--the Father; the Sheep--the<br>
 Treasure--the Beloved Son" <b><i>(Ragg)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:4 <B>{In the wilderness}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i er&#275;m&#333;i\)</i></b>. Their usual<br>
 pasturage, not a place of danger or peril. It is the owner of the<br>
 hundred sheep who cares so much for the one that is lost. He<br>
 knows each one of the sheep and loves each one. <B>{Go after that<br>
 which is lost}</B> <b><i>(\poreuetai epi to apol&#333;los\)</i></b>. The one lost sheep<br>
 <b><i>(\apol&#333;los\, second perfect active participle of \apollumi\, to<br>
 destroy, but intransitive, to be lost)</i></b>. There is nothing more<br>
 helpless than a lost sheep except a lost sinner. The sheep went<br>
 off by its own ignorance and folly. The use of \epi\ for the goal<br>
 occurs also in <!-#-->Mt 22:9; Ac 8:26; 9:11. <B>{Until he find it}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\he&#333;s heur&#275;i auto\)</i></b>. Second aorist active subjunctive of<br>
 \heurisk&#333;\, common verb, with \he&#333;s\, common Greek idiom. He<br>
 keeps on going <b><i>(\poreuetai\, linear present middle indicative)</i></b><br>
 until success comes <b><i>(effective aorist, \heur&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:5 <B>{On his shoulders}</B> <b><i>(\epi tous &#333;mous autou\)</i></b>. He does it<br>
 himself in exuberant affection and of necessity as the poor lost<br>
 sheep is helpless. Note the plural shoulders showing that the<br>
 sheep was just back of the shepherd's neck and drawn around by<br>
 both hands. The word for shoulder <b><i>(\&#333;mos\)</i></b> is old and common, but<br>
 in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mt 23:4. <B>{Rejoicing}</B> <b><i>(\chair&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 "There is no upbraiding of the wandering sheep, nor murmuring at<br>
 the trouble" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:6 <B>{Rejoice with me}</B> <b><i>(\sunchar&#275;te moi\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive<br>
 of \sunchair&#333;\, an old and common verb for mutual joy as in <!-#-->Php<br>
 2:17f. Joy demands fellowship. Same form in verse <!-#-->9. So the<br>
 shepherd <B>{calls together}</B> <b><i>(\sunkalei\, note \sun\ again)</i></b> both his<br>
 friends and his neighbours. This picture of the Good Shepherd has<br>
 captured the eye of many artists through the ages.<br>
 <br>
 15:7 <B>{Over one sinner that repenteth}</B> <b><i>(\epi heni hamart&#333;l&#333;i<br>
 metanoounti\)</i></b>. The word sinner points to verse <!-#-->1. Repenting is<br>
 what these sinners were doing, these lost sheep brought to the<br>
 fold. The joy in heaven is in contrast with the grumbling<br>
 Pharisees and scribes. <B>{More than over}</B> <b><i>(\&#275; epi\)</i></b>. There is no<br>
 comparative in the Greek. It is only implied by a common idiom<br>
 like our "rather than." <B>{Which need no repentance}</B> <b><i>(\hoitines ou<br>
 chreian echousin metanoias\)</i></b>. Jesus does not mean to say that the<br>
 Pharisees and the scribes do not need repentance or are perfect.<br>
 He for the sake of argument accepts their claims about themselves<br>
 and by their own words condemns them for their criticism of his<br>
 efforts to save the lost sheep. It is the same point that he made<br>
 against them when they criticized Jesus and the disciples for<br>
 being at Levi's feast <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 5:31f.)</i></b>. They posed as "righteous."<br>
 Very well, then. That shuts their mouths on the point of Christ's<br>
 saving the publicans and sinners.<br>
 <br>
 15:8 <B>{Ten pieces of silver}</B> <b><i>(\drachmas deka\)</i></b>. The only instance<br>
 in the N.T. of this old word for a coin of 65.5 grains about the<br>
 value of the common \d&#275;narius\ <b><i>(about eighteen cents)</i></b>, a quarter<br>
 of a Jewish shekel. The double drachma <b><i>(\didrachmon\)</i></b> occurs in<br>
 the N.T. only in <!-#-->Mt 17:24. The root is from \drassomai\, to<br>
 grasp with the hand <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 3:19)</i></b>, and so a handful of coin. Ten<br>
 drachmas would be equal to nearly two dollars, but in purchasing<br>
 power much more. <B>{Sweep}</B> <b><i>(\saroi\)</i></b>. A late colloquial verb<br>
 \saro&#333;\ for the earlier \sair&#333;\, to clear by sweeping. Three<br>
 times in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 11:25; 15:8; Mt 12:44)</i></b>. The house was<br>
 probably with out windows <b><i>(only the door for light and hence the<br>
 lamp lit)</i></b> and probably also a dirt floor. Hence Bengel says: _non<br>
 sine pulvere_. This parable is peculiar to Luke.<br>
 <br>
 15:9 <B>{Her friends and neighbours}</B> <b><i>(\tas philas kai geitonas\)</i></b>.<br>
 Note single article and female friends <b><i>(feminine article and<br>
 \philas\)</i></b>. \He&#333;s hou eur&#275;i\ here as in verse <!-#-->4, only \hou\<br>
 added after \he&#333;s\ <b><i>(until which time)</i></b> as often. <B>{Which I lost}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\h&#275;n ap&#333;lesa\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of \apollumi\.<br>
 She lost the coin <b><i>(note article)</i></b>. The shepherd did not lose the<br>
 one sheep.<br>
 <br>
 15:10 <B>{There is joy}</B> <b><i>(\ginetai chara\)</i></b>. More exactly, joy arises.<br>
 Futuristic present of \ginomai\ <b><i>(cf. \estai\ in verse <!-#-->7)</i></b>. <B>{In<br>
 the presence of the angels of God}</B> <b><i>(\en&#333;pion t&#333;n aggel&#333;n tou<br>
 theou\)</i></b>. That is to say, the joy of God himself. The angels are<br>
 in a sense the neighbours of God.<br>
 <br>
 15:11 <B>{Had}</B> <b><i>(\eichen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. Note \ech&#333;n\ <b><i>(verse<br>
 <!-#-->4)</i></b>, \echousa\ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->8)</i></b>, and now \eichen\. The<br>
 self-sacrificing care is that of the owner in each case. Here<br>
 <b><i>(verses <!-#-->11-32)</i></b> we have the most famous of all the parables of<br>
 Jesus, the Prodigal Son, which is in Luke alone. We have had the<br>
 Lost Sheep, the Lost Coin, and now the Lost Son. Bruce notes that<br>
 in the moral sphere there must be self-recovery to give ethical<br>
 value to the rescue of the son who wandered away. That comes out<br>
 beautifully in this allegory.<br>
 <br>
 15:12 <B>{The portion}</B> <b><i>(\to meros\)</i></b>. The Jewish law alloted one-half<br>
 as much to the younger son as to the elder, that is to say<br>
 one-third of the estate <b><i>(<!-#-->De 21:17)</i></b> at the death of the father.<br>
 The father did not have to abdicate in favour of the sons, but<br>
 "this very human parable here depicts the impatience of home<br>
 restraints and the optimistic ambition of youth" <b><i>(Ragg)</i></b>. <B>{And he<br>
 divided}</B> <b><i>(\ho de dieilen\)</i></b>. The second aorist active indicative<br>
 of \diaire&#333;\, an old and common verb to part in two, cut asunder,<br>
 divide, but in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->1Co 12:11. The elder son<br>
 got his share also of the "substance" or property or estate <b><i>(\t&#275;s<br>
 ousias\)</i></b>, "the living" <b><i>(\ton bion\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Mr 12:44, not "life"<br>
 as in <!-#-->Lu 8:14.<br>
 <br>
 15:13 <B>{Not many days after}</B> <b><i>(\met' ou pollas h&#275;meras\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, after not many days. Luke is fond of this idiom <b><i>(<!-#-->7:6;<br>
 Ac 1:5)</i></b>. <B>{Took his journey}</B> <b><i>(\aped&#275;m&#275;sen\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of \apod&#275;me&#333;\ <b><i>(from \apod&#275;mos\, away from home)</i></b>.<br>
 Common verb. In the N.T. here and <!-#-->Mt 21:33; 25:14; Mr 12:1; Lu<br>
 20:9. He burned all his bridges behind him, gathering together<br>
 all that he had. <B>{Wasted}</B> <b><i>(\dieskorpisen\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of \diaskorpiz&#333;\, a somewhat rare verb, the very<br>
 opposite of "gathered together" <b><i>(\sunagog&#333;n\)</i></b>. More exactly he<br>
 scattered his property. It is the word used of winnowing grain<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 25:24)</i></b>. <B>{With riotous living}</B> <b><i>(\z&#333;n as&#333;t&#333;s\)</i></b>. Living<br>
 dissolutely or profligately. The late adverb \as&#333;t&#333;s\ <b><i>(only here<br>
 in the N.T.)</i></b> from the common adjective \as&#333;tos\ <b><i>(\a\ privative<br>
 and \s&#333;z&#333;\)</i></b>, one that cannot be saved, one who does not save, a<br>
 spendthrift, an abandoned man, a profligate, a prodigal. He went<br>
 the limit of sinful excesses. It makes sense taken actively or<br>
 passively <b><i>(_prodigus_ or _perditus_)</i></b>, active probably here.<br>
 <br>
 15:14 <B>{When he had spent}</B> <b><i>(\dapan&#275;santos autou\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute. The verb is here used in a bad sense as in <!-#-->Jas 4:3.<br>
 See on \dapan&#275;\ &#175;Lu 14:28. <B>{He}</B> <b><i>(\autos\)</i></b>. Emphasis. <B>{To be in<br>
 want}</B> <b><i>(\hustereisthai\)</i></b>. The verb is from \husteros\, behind or<br>
 later <b><i>(comparative)</i></b>. We use "fall behind" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b> of one in<br>
 straitened circumstances. Plummer notes the coincidences of<br>
 Providence. The very land was in a famine when the boy had spent<br>
 all.<br>
 <br>
 15:15 <B>{Joined himself}</B> <b><i>(\ekoll&#275;th&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive of<br>
 \kolla&#333;\, an old verb to glue together, to cleave to. In the N.T.<br>
 only the passive occurs. He was glued to, was joined to. It is<br>
 not necessary to take this passive in the middle reflexive sense.<br>
 <B>{The citizens}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n polit&#333;n\)</i></b>. Curiously enough this common word<br>
 citizen <b><i>(\polit&#275;s\ from \polis\, city)</i></b> is found in the N.T. only<br>
 in Luke's writings <b><i>(<!-#-->15:15; 19:14; Ac 21:39)</i></b> except in <!-#-->He 8:11<br>
 where it is quoted from <!-#-->Jer 38:34. <B>{To feed swine}</B> <b><i>(\boskein<br>
 choirous\)</i></b>. A most degrading occupation for anyone and for a Jew<br>
 an unspeakable degradation.<br>
 <br>
 15:16 <B>{He would fain have been filled}</B> <b><i>(\epethumei<br>
 chortasth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. Literally, he was desiring <b><i>(longing)</i></b> to be<br>
 filled. Imperfect indicative and first aorist passive infinitive.<br>
 \Chortasth&#275;nai\ is from \chortaz&#333;\ and that from \chortos\<br>
 <b><i>(grass)</i></b>, and so to feed with grass or with anything. Westcott and<br>
 Hort put \gemisai t&#275;n koilian autou\ in the margin <b><i>(the Textus<br>
 Receptus)</i></b>. <B>{With the husks}</B> <b><i>(\ek t&#333;n kerati&#333;n\)</i></b>. The word occurs<br>
 here alone in the N.T. and is a diminutive of \keras\ <b><i>(horn)</i></b> and<br>
 so means little horn. It is used in various senses, but here<br>
 refers to the pods of the carob tree or locust tree still common<br>
 in Palestine and around the Mediterannean, so called from the<br>
 shape of the pods like little horns, _Bockshornbaum_ in German or<br>
 goat's-horn tree. The gelatinous substance inside has a sweetish<br>
 taste and is used for feeding swine and even for food by the<br>
 lower classes. It is sometimes called Saint John's Bread from the<br>
 notion that the Baptist ate it in the wilderness. <B>{No man gave<br>
 unto him}</B> <b><i>(\oudeis edidou aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. Continued<br>
 refusal of anyone to allow him even the food of the hogs.<br>
 <br>
 15:17 <B>{But when he came to himself}</B> <b><i>(\eis heauton de elth&#333;n\)</i></b>. As<br>
 if he had been far from himself as he was from home. As a matter<br>
 of fact he had been away, out of his head, and now began to see<br>
 things as they really were. Plato is quoted by Ackerman<br>
 <b><i>(_Christian Element in Plato_)</i></b> as thinking of redemption as<br>
 coming to oneself. <B>{Hired servants}</B> <b><i>(\misthioi\)</i></b>. A late word<br>
 from \misthos\ <b><i>(hire)</i></b>. In the N.T. only in this chapter. The use<br>
 of "many" here suggests a wealthy and luxurious home. <B>{Have bread<br>
 enough and to spare}</B> <b><i>(\perisseuontai art&#333;n\)</i></b>. Old verb from<br>
 \perissos\ and that from \peri\ <b><i>(around)</i></b>. Present passive here,<br>
 "are surrounded by loaves" like a flood. <B>{I perish}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; de<br>
 lim&#333;i h&#333;de apollumai\)</i></b>. Every word here counts: While I on the<br>
 other hand am here perishing with hunger. It is the linear<br>
 present middle of \apollumi\. Note \eg&#333;\ expressed and \de\ of<br>
 contrast.<br>
 <br>
 15:18 <B>{I will arise and go}</B> <b><i>(\anastas proreusomai\)</i></b>. This<br>
 determination is the act of the will after he comes to himself<br>
 and sees his real condition. <B>{I did sin}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;marton\)</i></b>. That is<br>
 the hard word to say and he will say it first. The word means to<br>
 miss the mark. I shot my bolt and I missed my aim <b><i>(compare the<br>
 high-handed demand in verse <!-#-->12)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:19 <B>{No longer worthy}</B> <b><i>(\ouketi axios\)</i></b>. Confession of the<br>
 facts. He sees his own pitiful plight and is humble. <B>{As one}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\h&#333;s hena\)</i></b>. The hired servants in his father's house are high<br>
 above him now.<br>
 <br>
 15:20 <B>{To his father}</B> <b><i>(\pros ton patera heautou\)</i></b>. Literally, to<br>
 his own father. He acted at once on his decision. <B>{Yet afar off}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eti autou makran apechontos\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute. \Makran\<br>
 agrees with \hodon\ understood: While he was yet holding off a<br>
 distant way. This shows that the father had been looking for him<br>
 to come back and was even looking at this very moment as he came<br>
 in sight. <B>{Ran}</B> <b><i>(\dram&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of<br>
 the defective verb \trech&#333;\. The eager look and longing of the<br>
 father. <B>{Kissed}</B> <b><i>(\katephil&#275;sen\)</i></b>. Note perfective use of \kata\<br>
 kissed him much, kissed him again and again. The verb occurs so<br>
 in the older Greek.<br>
 <br>
 15:21 The son made his speech of confession as planned, but it is<br>
 not certain that he was able to finish as a number of early<br>
 manuscripts do not have "Make me as one of the hired servants,"<br>
 though Aleph B D do have them. It is probable that the father<br>
 interrupted him at this point before he could finish.<br>
 <br>
 15:22 <B>{The best robe}</B> <b><i>(\stol&#275;n t&#275;n pr&#333;t&#275;n\)</i></b>. \Stol&#275;\ is an old<br>
 word for a fine stately garment that comes down to the feet <b><i>(from<br>
 \stello\, to prepare, equip)</i></b>, the kind worn by kings <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 16:5;<br>
 Lu 22:46)</i></b>. Literally, "a robe the first." But not the first that<br>
 you find, but the first in rank and value, the finest in the<br>
 house. This in contrast with his shabby clothes. <B>{A ring}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\daktulion\)</i></b>. Common in classical writers and the LXX, but here<br>
 only in the N.T. From \daktulos\, finger. See \chrusodaktulios\<br>
 in <!-#-->Jas 2:2. <B>{Shoes}</B> <b><i>(\hupod&#275;mata\)</i></b>. Sandals, "bound under."<br>
 Both sandals and ring are marks of the freeman as slaves were<br>
 barefooted.<br>
 <br>
 15:23 <B>{The fatted calf}</B> <b><i>(\ton moschon ton siteuton\)</i></b>. The calf<br>
 the fatted one. \Siteuton\ is the verbal adjective of \sileu&#333;\,<br>
 to feed with wheat <b><i>(\sitos\)</i></b>. The calf was kept fat for festive<br>
 occasions, possibly in the hope of the son's return. <B>{Kill}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\thusate\)</i></b>. Not as a sacrifice, but for the feast. <B>{Make merry}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\euphranth&#333;men\)</i></b>. First aorist passive subjunctive <b><i>(volitive)</i></b>.<br>
 From \euphrain&#333;\, an old verb from \eu\ <b><i>(well)</i></b> and \phr&#275;n\<br>
 <b><i>(mind)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 15:24 <B>{And is alive}</B> <b><i>(\kai anez&#275;sen\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of \anaza&#333;\, to live again. Literally, he was dead and<br>
 he came back to life. <B>{He was lost}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n apol&#333;l&#333;s\, periphrastic<br>
 past perfect active of \apollumi\ and intransitive, in a lost<br>
 state)</i></b> and he was found <b><i>(\heureth&#275;\)</i></b>. He was found, we have to<br>
 say, but this aorist passive is really timeless, he is found<br>
 after long waiting <b><i>(effective aorist)</i></b> The artists have vied with<br>
 each other in picturing various items connected with this<br>
 wonderful parable.<br>
 <br>
 15:25 <B>{As he came and drew nigh}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s erchomenos &#275;ggisen\)</i></b>. More<br>
 exactly, "As, coming, he drew nigh," for \erchomenos\ is present<br>
 middle participle and \&#275;ggisen\ is aorist active indicative.<br>
 <B>{Music}</B> <b><i>(\sumph&#333;nias\)</i></b>. Our word "symphony." An old Greek word<br>
 from \sumph&#333;nos\ <b><i>(\sun\, together, and \ph&#333;n&#275;\, voice or sound)</i></b>,<br>
 <B>{harmony, concord}</B>, by a band of musicians. Here alone in the<br>
 N.T. <B>{And dancing}</B> <b><i>(\kai chor&#333;n\)</i></b>. An old word again, but here<br>
 alone in the N.T. Origin uncertain, possibly from \orchos\ by<br>
 metathesis <b><i>(\orcheomai\, to dance)</i></b>. A circular dance on the<br>
 green.<br>
 <br>
 15:26 <B>{Servants}</B> <b><i>(\paid&#333;n\)</i></b>. Not \douloi\ <b><i>(bondslaves)</i></b> as in<br>
 verse <!-#-->22. The Greeks often used \pais\ for servant like the<br>
 Latin _puer_. It could be either a hired servant <b><i>(\misthios\,<br>
 verse <!-#-->17)</i></b> or slave <b><i>(\doulos\)</i></b>. <B>{He inquired}</B> <b><i>(\epunthaneto\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect middle, inquired repeatedly and eagerly. <B>{What these<br>
 things might be}</B> <b><i>(\ti an ei&#275; tauta\)</i></b>. Not "poor" Greek as Easton<br>
 holds, but simply the form of the direct question retained in the<br>
 indirect. See the direct form as the apodosis of a condition of<br>
 the fourth class in <!-#-->Ac 17:18. In <!-#-->Ac 10:17 we have the<br>
 construction with \an ei&#275;\ of the direct retained in the indirect<br>
 question. So also in <!-#-->Lu 1:62: See Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 1044.<br>
 <br>
 15:27 <B>{Is come}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;kei\)</i></b>. Present indicative active, but a stem<br>
 with perfect sense, old verb \h&#275;k&#333;\ retaining this use after<br>
 perfect tenses came into use <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 893)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Hath killed}</B> <b><i>(\ethusen\)</i></b>. Aorist active indicative and literally<br>

 <br>
 15:29 <B>{Do I serve thee}</B> <b><i>(\douleu&#333; soi\)</i></b>. Progressive present<br>
 tense of this old verb from \doulos\ <b><i>(slave)</i></b> which the elder son<br>

 occurs. <B>{That I might make merry}</B> <b><i>(\hina euphranth&#333;\)</i></b>. Final<br>

 <b><i>(\kataphag&#333;n\)</i></b>. We say, "eaten up," but the Greek has, "eaten<br>
 down" <b><i>(perfective use of \kata-\)</i></b>. Suggested by the feasting<br>
 going on. <B>{With harlots}</B> <b><i>(\meta porn&#333;n\)</i></b>. This may be true <b><i>(verse<br>

 necessity in the father's heart and in the joy of the return that<br>
 justifies the feasting. \Euphranth&#275;nai\ is used again <b><i>(first<br>
 aorist passive infinitive)</i></b> and \char&#275;nai\ <b><i>(second aorist passive<br>
 infinitive)</i></b> is more than mere hilarity, deep-seated joy. The<br>
 father repeats to the elder son the language of his heart used in<br>
 verse <!-#-->24 to his servants. A real father could do no less. One<br>
 can well imagine how completely the Pharisees and scribes <b><i>(verse<br>
 <!-#-->2)</i></b> were put to silence by these three marvellous parables. The<br>
 third does it with a graphic picture of their own attitude in the<br>
 case of the surly elder brother. Luke was called a painter by the<br>
 ancients. Certainly he has produced a graphic pen picture here of<br>
 God's love for the lost that justifies forever the coming of<br>
 Christ to the world to seek and to save the lost. It glorifies<br>
 also soul-saving on the part of his followers who are willing to<br>
 go with Jesus after the lost in city and country, in every land<br>
 and of every race.<br>
