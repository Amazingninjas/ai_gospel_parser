<p>7:2 <B>{With defiled, that is unwashen hands}</B> <b><i>(\koinais chersin,<br>
 tout' estin aniptois\)</i></b>. Associative instrumental case. Originally<br>
 \koinos\ meant what was common to everybody like the _Koin&#275;_<br>
 Greek. But in later Greek it came also to mean as here what is<br>
 vulgar or profane. So Peter in <!-#-->Ac 10:14 "common and unclean."<br>
 The next step was the ceremonially unclean. The emissaries of the<br>
 Pharisees and the scribes from Jerusalem had seen "some of the<br>
 disciples" eat without washing their hands, how many we are not<br>
 told. Swete suggests that in going through the plain the<br>
 disciples were seen eating some of the bread preserved in the<br>
 twelve baskets the afternoon before across the lake. There was no<br>
 particular opportunity to wash the hands, a very proper thing to<br>
 do before eating for sanitary reasons. But the objection raised<br>
 is on ceremonial, not sanitary, grounds.<br>
 <br>
 7:3 <B>{Diligently}</B> <b><i>(\pugm&#275;i\)</i></b>. Instrumental case, <B>{with the fist}</B>,<br>
 up to the elbow, rubbing one hand and arm with the other hand<br>
 clenched. Aleph had \pukna\ probably because of the difficulty<br>
 about \pugm&#275;i\ <b><i>(kin to Latin _pugnus_)</i></b>. Schultess considers it a<br>
 dry wash or rubbing of the hands without water as a ritualistic<br>
 concession. The middle voice \nips&#333;ntai\ means their own hands.<br>
 This verb is often used for parts of the body while \lou&#333;\ is<br>
 used of the whole body <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 13:10)</i></b>. On the tradition of the<br>
 elders see on &#175;Mt 15:2.<br>
 <br>
 7:4 <B>{From the marketplace}</B> <b><i>(\ap' agoras\)</i></b>. Ceremonial defilement<br>
 was inevitable in the mixing with men in public. This \agora\<br>
 from \ageir&#333;\ to collect or gather, was a public forum in every<br>
 town where the people gathered like the courthouse square in<br>
 American towns. The disciples were already ceremonially defiled.<br>
 <B>{Wash themselves}</B> <b><i>(\baptis&#333;ntai\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 subjunctive of \baptiz&#333;\, dip or immerse. Westcott and Hort put<br>
 \rantis&#333;ntai\ in the text translated "sprinkle themselves" in the<br>
 margin of the Revised Version, because Aleph, B, and some of the<br>
 best cursives have it. Gould terms \rantis&#333;ntai\ "a manifest<br>
 emendation," to get rid of the difficulty of dipping or bathing<br>
 the whole body. Meyer says: "The statement proceeds by way of<br>
 climax: before eating they wash the hands always. When they come<br>
 from market they take a bath before eating." This is not the<br>
 place to enter into any controversy about the meaning of<br>
 \baptiz&#333;\, to dip, \rantiz&#333;\, to sprinkle, and \ecche&#333;\, to pour,<br>
 all used in the New Testament. The words have their distinctive<br>
 meanings here as elsewhere. Some scribes felt a difficulty about<br>
 the use of \baptis&#333;ntai\ here. The Western and Syrian classes of<br>
 manuscripts add "and couches" <b><i>(\kai klin&#333;n\)</i></b> at the end of the<br>
 sentence. Swete considers the immersions of beds <b><i>(\baptismous<br>
 klin&#333;n\)</i></b> "an incongruous combination." But Gould says: "Edersheim<br>
 shows that the Jewish ordinance required immersions,<br>
 \baptismous\, of these vessels." We must let the Jewish<br>
 scrupulosity stand for itself, though "and couches" is not<br>
 supported by Aleph, B L D Bohairic, probably not genuine.<br>
 <br>
 7:6 <B>{Well}</B> <b><i>(\kal&#333;s\)</i></b>. Appositely here, but ironical sarcasm in<br>
 verse <!-#-->9. Note here "you hypocrites" <b><i>(\hum&#333;n t&#333;n hupokrit&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:8 <B>{Ye leave the commandment of God}</B> <b><i>(\aphentes t&#275;n entol&#275;n tou<br>
 theou\)</i></b>. Note the sharp contrast between the command of God and<br>
 the traditions of men. Jesus here drives a keen wedge into the<br>
 Pharisaic contention. They had covered up the Word of God with<br>
 their oral teaching. Jesus here shows that they care more for the<br>
 oral teaching of the scribes and elders than for the written law<br>
 of God. The Talmud gives abundant and specific confirmation of<br>
 the truthfulness of this indictment.<br>
 <br>
 7:9 <B>{Full well do ye reject the commandment of God that ye may<br>
 keep your traditions}</B> <b><i>(\kal&#333;s atheteite t&#275;n entol&#275;n tou theou<br>
 hina t&#275;n paradosin hum&#333;n t&#275;r&#275;s&#275;te\)</i></b>. One can almost see the<br>
 scribes withering under this terrible arraignment. It was biting<br>
 sarcasm that cut to the bone. The evident irony should prevent<br>
 literal interpretation as commendation of the Pharisaic pervasion<br>
 of God's word. See my _The Pharisees and Jesus_ for illustrations<br>
 of the way that they placed this oral tradition above the written<br>
 law. See on &#175;Mt 15:7.<br>
 <br>
 7:11 <B>{Corban}</B> <b><i>(\korban ho estin d&#333;ron\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 15:5. Mark<br>
 preserves the Hebrew word for a gift or offering to God <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex<br>
 21:17; Le 20:9)</i></b>, indeclinable here, meaning <B>{gift}</B> <b><i>(\d&#333;ron\)</i></b>,<br>
 but declinable \korbanas\ in <!-#-->Mt 27:6, meaning sacred treasury.<br>
 The rabbis <b><i>(<B>{but ye say}</B>, \humeis de legete\)</i></b> actually allowed<br>
 the mere saying of this word by an unfaithful son to prevent the<br>
 use of needed money for the support of father or mother. It was a<br>
 home thrust to these pettifogging sticklers for ceremonial<br>
 punctilios. They not only justified such a son's trickery, but<br>
 held that he was prohibited from using it for father or mother,<br>
 but he might use it for himself.<br>
 <br>
 7:13 <B>{Making void the word of God by your tradition}</B> <b><i>(\akurountes<br>
 ton logon tou theou t&#275;i paradosei hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 15:6 for<br>
 the word \akurountes\, invalidating, a stronger word than<br>
 \athetein\, to set aside, in verse <!-#-->9. See both used in <!-#-->Ga<br>
 3:15,17. Setting aside does invalidate.<br>
 <br>
 7:14 <B>{And he called to him the multitude again}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 proskalesamenos palin ton ochlon\)</i></b>. Aorist middle participle,<br>
 calling to himself. The rabbis had attacked the disciples about<br>
 not washing their hands before eating. Jesus now turned the<br>
 tables on them completely and laid bare their hollow pretentious<br>
 hypocrisy to the people. <B>{Hear me all of you and understand}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\akousate mou pantes kai suniete\)</i></b>. A most pointed appeal to the<br>
 people to see into and see through the chicanery of these<br>
 ecclesiastics. See on &#175;Mt 15:11 for discussion.<br>
 <br>
 7:17 <B>{When he was entered into the house from the multitude}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hote eis&#275;lthen eis oikon apo tou ochlou\)</i></b>. This detail in Mark<br>
 alone, probably in Peter's house in Capernaum. To the crowd Jesus<br>
 spoke the parable of corban, but the disciples want it<br>
 interpreted <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->4:10ff.,33ff.)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 15:15 represents Peter as<br>
 the spokesman as was usually the case.<br>
 <br>
 7:18 <B>{Are ye so without understanding also?}</B> <b><i>(\Hout&#333;s kai humeis<br>
 asunetoi este;\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 15:16. You also as well as the<br>
 multitude. It was a discouraging moment for the great Teacher if<br>
 his own chosen pupils <b><i>(disciples)</i></b> were still under the spell of<br>
 the Pharisaic theological outlook. It was a riddle to them. "They<br>
 had been trained in Judaism, in which the distinction between<br>
 clean and unclean is ingrained, and could not understand a<br>
 statement abrogating this" <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>. They had noticed that the<br>
 Pharisees stumbled at the parable of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 15:12)</i></b>. They<br>
 were stumbling themselves and did not know how to answer the<br>
 Pharisees. Jesus charges the disciples with intellectual dulness<br>
 and spiritual stupidity.<br>
 <br>
 7:19 <B>{Making all meats clean}</B> <b><i>(\kathariz&#333;n panta ta br&#333;mata\)</i></b>.<br>
 This anacoluthon can be understood by repeating <B>{he says}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\legei\)</i></b> from verse <!-#-->18. The masculine participle agrees with<br>
 Jesus, the speaker. The words do not come from Jesus, but are<br>
 added by Mark. Peter reports this item to Mark, probably with a<br>
 vivid recollection of his own experience on the housetop in Joppa<br>
 when in the vision Peter declined three times the Lord's<br>
 invitation to kill and eat unclean animals <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10:14-16)</i></b>. It<br>
 was a riddle to Peter as late as that day. "Christ asserts that<br>
 _Levitical_ uncleanness, such as eating with unwashed hands, is<br>
 of small importance compared with _moral_ uncleanness" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>.<br>
 The two chief words in both incidents, here and in Acts, are<br>
 <B>{defile}</B> <b><i>(\koino&#333;\)</i></b> and <B>{cleanse}</B> <b><i>(\kathariz&#333;\)</i></b>. "What God<br>
 cleansed do not thou treat as defiled" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10:15)</i></b>. It was a<br>
 revolutionary declaration by Jesus and Peter was slow to<br>
 understand it even after the coming of the Holy Spirit at<br>
 Pentecost. Jesus was amply justified in his astonished question:<br>
 <B>{Perceive ye not?}</B> <b><i>(\ou noeite;\)</i></b>. They were making little use of<br>
 their intelligence in trying to comprehend the efforts of Jesus<br>
 to give them a new and true spiritual insight.<br>
 <br>
 7:21 <B>{Evil thoughts}</B> <b><i>(\hoi dialogismoi hoi kakoi\)</i></b>. These come<br>
 out of the heart <b><i>(\ek t&#275;s kardias\)</i></b>, the inner man, and lead to<br>
 the dreadful list here given like the crimes of a modern police<br>
 court: <B>{fornications}</B> <b><i>(\porneiai\, usually of the unmarried)</i></b>,<br>
 <B>{adulteries}</B> <b><i>(\moichaiai\, of the married)</i></b>, <B>{thefts}</B> <b><i>(\klopai\,<br>
 stealings)</i></b>, <B>{covetings}</B> <b><i>(\pleonexiai\, craze for more and more)</i></b>,<br>
 <B>{murders}</B> <b><i>(\phonoi\, growing out of the others often)</i></b>,<br>
 <B>{wickednesses}</B> <b><i>(\pon&#275;riai\, from \ponos\, toil, then drudge, bad<br>
 like our _knave_, serving boy like German _Knabe_, and then<br>
 criminal)</i></b>, <B>{deceit}</B> <b><i>(\dolos\, lure or snare with bait)</i></b>,<br>
 <B>{lasciviousness}</B> <b><i>(\aselgeia\, unrestrained sex instinct)</i></b>, <B>{evil<br>
 eye}</B> <b><i>(\ophthalmos pon&#275;ros\)</i></b> or eye that works evil and that<br>
 haunts one with its gloating stare, <B>{railing}</B> <b><i>(\blasph&#275;mia\,<br>
 blasphemy, hurtful speech)</i></b>, <B>{pride}</B> <b><i>(\huper&#275;phania\, holding<br>
 oneself above others, stuck up)</i></b>, <B>{foolishness}</B> <b><i>(\aphrosun&#275;\, lack<br>
 of sense)</i></b>, a fitting close to it all.<br>
 <br>
 7:24 <B>{Into the borders of Tyre and Sidon}</B> <b><i>(\eis ta horia Turou<br>
 kai Sid&#333;nos\)</i></b>. The departure from Capernaum was a withdrawal from<br>
 Galilee, the second of the four withdrawals from Galilee. The<br>
 first had been to the region of Bethsaida Julias in the territory<br>
 of Herod Philip. This is into distinctly heathen land. It was not<br>
 merely the edge of Phoenicia, but into the parts of Tyre and<br>
 Sidon <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 15:21)</i></b>. There was too much excitement among the<br>
 people, too much bitterness among the Pharisees, too much<br>
 suspicion on the part of Herod Antipas, too much dulness on the<br>
 part of the disciples for Jesus to remain in Galilee. <B>{And he<br>
 could not be hid}</B> <b><i>(\kai ouk &#275;dunasth&#275; lathein\)</i></b>. Jesus wanted to<br>
 be alone in the house after all the strain in Galilee. He craved<br>
 a little privacy and rest. This was his purpose in going into<br>
 Phoenicia. Note the adversative sense of \kai\ here= "but."<br>
 <br>
 7:25 <B>{Whose little daughter}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;s to thugatrion aut&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Diminutive with tender touch. Note "whose" and "her" like<br>
 vernacular today. <B>{Having heard of him}</B> <b><i>(\akousasa peri autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Even in this heathen territory the fame of Jesus was known. When<br>
 the Sermon on the Mount was preached people were there from "the<br>
 sea coast of Tyre and Sidon" <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 6:17)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:26 <B>{A Greek, a Syro-Phoenician by race}</B> <b><i>(\Hell&#275;nis,<br>
 Surophoinikissa t&#333;i genei\)</i></b>. "A Greek in religion, a Syrian in<br>
 tongue, a Phoenician in race" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>, from Euthymius Zigabenus.<br>
 She was not a Phoenician of Carthage. <B>{She besought}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;r&#333;ta\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect tense. She kept at it. This verb, as in late Greek, is<br>
 here used for a request, not a mere question. Abundant examples<br>
 in the papyri in this sense.<br>
 <br>
 7:27 <B>{Let the children first be filled}</B> <b><i>(\aphes pr&#333;ton<br>
 chortasth&#275;nai ta paidia\)</i></b>. The Jews had the first claim. See the<br>
 command of Jesus in the third tour of Galilee to avoid the<br>
 Gentiles and the Samaritans <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:5)</i></b>. Paul was the Apostle to<br>
 the Gentiles, but he gave the Jew the first opportunity <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro<br>
 2:9f.)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 15:24f.<br>
 <br>
 7:28 <B>{Even the dogs under the table}</B> <b><i>(\kai ta kunaria hupokat&#333;<br>
 t&#275;s trapez&#275;s\)</i></b>. A delightful picture. Even the little dogs<br>
 <b><i>(\kunaria\)</i></b> under the table <B>{eat of the children's crumbs}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\esthiousin apo t&#333;n psichi&#333;n t&#333;n paidi&#333;n\)</i></b>. Little dogs, little<br>
 scraps of bread <b><i>(\psichion\, diminutive of \psichos\, _morsel_)</i></b>,<br>
 little children <b><i>(\paidia\, diminutive of \pais\)</i></b>. Probably the<br>
 little children purposely dropped a few little crumbs for the<br>
 little dogs. These household dogs, pets of and loved by the<br>
 children. _Braid Scots_ has it: "Yet the wee dowgs aneath the<br>
 table eat o' the moole o' the bairns." "A unique combination of<br>
 faith and wit" <b><i>(Gould)</i></b>. Instead of resenting Christ's words about<br>
 giving the children's bread to the dogs <b><i>(Gentiles)</i></b> in verse <!-#-->27,<br>
 she instantly turned it to the advantage of her plea for her<br>
 little daughter.<br>
 <br>
 7:29 <B>{For this saying}</B> <b><i>(\dia touton ton logon\)</i></b>. She had faith,<br>
 great faith as <!-#-->Mt 15:28 shows, but it was her quick and bright<br>
 repartee that pleased Jesus. He had missed his rest, but it was<br>
 worth it to answer a call like this.<br>
 <br>
 7:30 <B>{And the demon gone out}</B> <b><i>(\kai to daimonion exel&#275;luthos\)</i></b>.<br>
 This was her crumb from the children's table. The perfect active<br>
 participle expresses the state of completion. The demon was gone<br>
 for good and all.<br>
 <br>
 7:31 <B>{Through the midst of the borders of Decapolis}</B> <b><i>(\ana meson<br>
 t&#333;n hori&#333;n Dekapole&#333;s\)</i></b>. Jesus left Phoenicia, but did not go<br>
 back into Galilee. He rather went east and came down east of the<br>
 Sea of Galilee into the region of the Greek cities of Decapolis.<br>
 He thus kept out of the territory of Herod Antipas. He had been<br>
 in this region when he healed the Gadarene demoniac and was asked<br>
 to leave.<br>
 <br>
 7:32 <B>{And they bring unto him}</B> <b><i>(\kai pherousin aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Another<br>
 of Mark's dramatic presents. This incident only in Mark.<br>
 <br>
 7:33 <B>{Took him aside}</B> <b><i>(\apolabomenos auton\)</i></b>. The secrecy here<br>
 observed was partly to avoid excitement and partly to get the<br>
 attention of the deaf and dumb demoniac. He could not hear what<br>
 Jesus said. So Jesus put his fingers into his ears, spat, and<br>
 touched his tongue. There was, of course, no virtue in the<br>
 spittle and it is not clear why Jesus used it. Saliva was by some<br>
 regarded as remedial and was used by exorcists in their<br>
 incantations. Whether this was a concession to the man's<br>
 denseness one does not know. But it all showed the poor man that<br>
 Jesus healed him in his own way.<br>
 <br>
 7:34 <B>{Ephphatha}</B> <b><i>(\dianoichth&#275;ti\, be opened)</i></b>. Another one of<br>
 Mark's Aramaic words preserved and transliterated and then<br>
 translated into Greek. "Be thou unbarred" <b><i>(_Braid Scots_)</i></b>. Jesus<br>
 sighed <b><i>(\estenaxen\)</i></b> as he looked up into heaven and spoke the<br>
 word \ephphatha\. Somehow he felt a nervous strain in this<br>
 complex case <b><i>(deaf, dumb, demoniac)</i></b> that we may not quite<br>
 comprehend.<br>
 <br>
 7:35 <B>{He spake plain}</B> <b><i>(\elalei orth&#333;s\)</i></b>. He began to speak<br>
 correctly. Inchoative imperfect tense.<br>
 <br>
 7:36 <B>{So much the more a great deal they published it}</B> <b><i>(\autoi<br>
 m&#257;llon perissoteron ek&#275;russon\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense, continued<br>
 action. Double comparative as occurs elsewhere for emphasis as in<br>
 <!-#-->Php 1:23 "much more better" <b><i>(\poll&#333;i m&#257;llon kreisson\)</i></b>. See<br>
 Robertson's _Grammar_, pp. 663f. Human nature is a peculiar<br>
 thing. The command not to tell provoked these people to tell just<br>
 as the leper had done <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:44f.)</i></b>. The more Jesus commanded<br>
 <b><i>(\hoson autois diestelleto\)</i></b> them not to tell the more they told.<br>
 It was a continuous performance. Prohibitions always affect some<br>
 people that way, especially superficial and light-headed folks.<br>
 But we have to have prohibitions or anarchy.<br>
 <br>
 7:37 <B>{He hath done all things well}</B> <b><i>(\Kal&#333;s panta pepoi&#275;ken\)</i></b>.<br>
 The present perfect active shows the settled convictions of these<br>
 people about Jesus. Their great amazement <b><i>(\huperperiss&#333;s<br>
 exepl&#275;ssonto\)</i></b>, imperfect passive and compound adverb, thus found<br>
 expression in a vociferous championship of Jesus in this pagan<br>
 land.<br>
