<p>1:1 <B>{Called to be an apostle}</B> <b><i>(\kl&#275;tos apostolos\)</i></b>. Verbal<br>
 adjective \kl&#275;tos\ from \kale&#333;\, without \einai\, to be.<br>
 Literally, <B>{a called apostle}</B> <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:1)</i></b>, not so-called, but one<br>
 whose apostleship is due not to himself or to men <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 1:1)</i></b>, but<br>
 to God, <B>{through the will of God}</B> <b><i>(\dia thel&#275;matos tou theou\)</i></b>.<br>
 The intermediate <b><i>(\dia, duo\, two)</i></b> agent between Paul's not being<br>
 Christ's apostle and becoming one was God's will <b><i>(\thel&#275;ma\,<br>
 something willed of God)</i></b>, God's command <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 1:1)</i></b>. Paul knows<br>
 that he is not one of the twelve apostles, but he is on a par<br>
 with them because, like them, he is chosen by God. He is an<br>
 apostle of Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus <b><i>(MSS. vary here, later<br>
 epistles usually Christ Jesus)</i></b>. The refusal of the Judaizers to<br>
 recognize Paul as equal to the twelve made him the more careful<br>
 to claim his position. Bengel sees here Paul's denial of mere<br>
 human authority in his position and also of personal merit:<br>
 _Namque mentione Dei excluditur auctoramentum humanum, mentione<br>
 Voluntatis Dei, meritum Pauli_. <B>{Our brother}</B> <b><i>(\ho adelphos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, the brother, but regular Greek idiom for our brother.<br>
 This Sosthenes, now with Paul in Ephesus, is probably the same<br>
 Sosthenes who received the beating meant for Paul in Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 18:17)</i></b>. If so, the beating did him good for he is now a follower<br>
 of Christ. He is in no sense a co-author of the Epistle, but<br>
 merely associated with Paul because they knew him in Corinth. He<br>
 may have been compelled by the Jews to leave Corinth when he, a<br>
 ruler of the synagogue, became a Christian. See <!-#-->1Th 1:1 for the<br>
 mention of Silas and Timothy in the salutation. Sosthenes could<br>
 have been Paul's amanuensis for this letter, but there is no<br>
 proof of it.<br>
 <br>
 1:2 <B>{The church of God}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i ekkl&#275;si&#257;i tou theou\)</i></b>. Belonging to<br>
 God, not to any individual or faction, as this genitive case<br>
 shows. In <!-#-->1Th 1:1 Paul wrote "the church of the Thessalonians<br>
 in God" <b><i>(\en the&#333;i\)</i></b>, but "the churches of God" in <!-#-->1Th 2:14.<br>
 See same idiom in <!-#-->1Co 10:32; 11:16,22; 15:9; 2Co 1:1; Ga 1:13,<br>
 etc. <B>{Which is in Corinth}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i ous&#275;i en Korinth&#333;i\)</i></b>. See on <!-#-->Ac<br>
 13:1 for idiom. It is God's church even in Corinth, "_laetum et<br>
 ingens paradoxon_" <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>. This city, destroyed by Mummius B.C.<br>
 146, had been restored by Julius Caesar a hundred years later,<br>
 B.C. 44, and now after another hundred years has become very rich<br>
 and very corrupt. The very word "to Corinthianize" meant to<br>
 practise vile immoralities in the worship of Aphrodite <b><i>(Venus)</i></b>.<br>
 It was located on the narrow Isthmus of the Peloponnesus with two<br>
 harbours <b><i>(Lechaeum and Cenchreae)</i></b>. It had schools of rhetoric and<br>
 philosophy and made a flashy imitation of the real culture of<br>
 Athens. See <!-#-->Ac 18 for the story of Paul's work here and now the<br>
 later developments and divisions in this church will give Paul<br>
 grave concern as is shown in detail in I and II Corinthians. All<br>
 the problems of a modern city church come to the front in<br>
 Corinth. They call for all the wisdom and statesmanship in Paul.<br>
 <B>{That are sanctified}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;giasmenois\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle of \hagiaz&#333;\, late form for \hagiz&#333;\, so far found<br>
 only in the Greek Bible and in ecclesiastical writers. It means<br>
 to make or to declare \hagion\ <b><i>(from \hagos\, awe, reverence, and<br>
 this from \haz&#333;\, to venerate)</i></b>. It is significant that Paul uses<br>
 this word concerning the <B>{called saints}</B> or <B>{called to be saints}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kl&#275;tois hagiois\)</i></b> in Corinth. Cf. \kl&#275;tos apostolos\ in <!-#-->1:1.<br>
 It is because they are sanctified <B>{in Christ Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\en Christ&#333;i<br>
 I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. He is the sphere in which this act of consecration takes<br>
 place. Note plural, construction according to sense, because<br>
 \ekkl&#275;sia\ is a collective substantive. <B>{With all that call upon}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sun p&#257;sin tois epikaloumenois\)</i></b>. Associative instrumental case<br>
 with \sun\ rather than \kai\ <b><i>(and)</i></b>, making a close connection<br>
 with "saints" just before and so giving the Corinthian Christians<br>
 a picture of their close unity with the brotherhood everywhere<br>
 through the common bond of faith. This phrase occurs in the LXX<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 12:8; Zec 13:9)</i></b> and is applied to Christ as to Jehovah<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 1:7,9,12; Php 2:9,10)</i></b>. Paul heard Stephen pray to Christ<br>
 as Lord <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 7:59)</i></b>. Here "with a plain and direct reference to<br>
 the Divinity of our Lord" <b><i>(Ellicott)</i></b>. <B>{Their Lord and ours}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aut&#333;n kai h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. This is the interpretation of the Greek<br>
 commentators and is the correct one, an afterthought and<br>
 expansion <b><i>(\epanorth&#333;sis\)</i></b> of the previous "our," showing the<br>
 universality of Christ.<br>
 <br>
 1:3 Identical language of <!-#-->2Th 1:2 save absence of \h&#275;m&#333;n\<br>
 <b><i>(our)</i></b>, Paul's usual greeting. See on &#175;1Th 1:1.<br>
 <br>
 1:4 <B>{I thank my God}</B> <b><i>(\eucharist&#333; t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>. Singular as in <!-#-->Ro<br>
 1:8; Php 1:3; Phm 1:4, but plural in <!-#-->1Th 1:2; Col 1:3. The<br>
 grounds of Paul's thanksgivings in his Epistles are worthy of<br>
 study. Even in the church in Corinth he finds something to thank<br>
 God for, though in II Cor. there is no expression of thanksgiving<br>
 because of the acute crisis in Corinth nor is there any in<br>
 Galatians. But Paul is gracious here and allows his general<br>
 attitude <b><i>(always, \pantote\)</i></b> concerning <b><i>(\peri\, around)</i></b> the<br>
 Corinthians to override the specific causes of irritation. <B>{For<br>
 the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\epi<br>
 t&#275;i chariti tou theou t&#275;i dotheis&#275;i humin en Christ&#333;i I&#275;sou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Upon the basis of <b><i>(\epi\)</i></b> God's grace, not in general, but<br>
 specifically given <b><i>(\dotheis&#275;i\, first aorist passive participle<br>
 of \did&#333;mi\)</i></b>, in the sphere of <b><i>(\en\ as in verse <!-#-->2)</i></b> Christ<br>
 Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 1:5 <B>{That}</B> <b><i>(\hoti\)</i></b>. Explicit specification of this grace of God<br>
 given to the Corinthians. Paul points out in detail the unusual<br>
 spiritual gifts which were their glory and became their peril<br>
 <b><i>(chapters <!-#-->1Co 12-14)</i></b>. <B>{Ye were enriched in him}</B> <b><i>(\eploutisth&#275;te<br>
 en aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of \ploutiz&#333;\, old<br>
 causative verb from \ploutos\, wealth, common in Attic writers,<br>
 dropped out for centuries, reappeared in LXX. In N.T. only three<br>
 times and alone in Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 1:5; 2Co 6:10,11)</i></b>. The Christian<br>
 finds his real riches in Christ, one of Paul's pregnant phrases<br>
 full of the truest mysticism. <B>{In all utterance and all<br>
 knowledge}</B> <b><i>(\en panti log&#333;i kai pas&#275;i gn&#333;sei\)</i></b>. One detail in<br>
 explanation of the riches in Christ. The outward expression<br>
 <b><i>(\log&#333;i\)</i></b> here is put before the inward knowledge <b><i>(\gn&#333;sei\)</i></b><br>
 which should precede all speech. But we get at one's knowledge by<br>
 means of his speech. Chapters <!-#-->1Co 12-14 throw much light on<br>
 this element in the spiritual gifts of the Corinthians <b><i>(the gift<br>
 of tongues, interpreting tongues, discernment)</i></b> as summed up in<br>
 <!-#-->1Co 13:1,2, the greater gifts of <!-#-->12:31. It was a marvellously<br>
 endowed church in spite of their perversions.<br>
 <br>
 1:6 <B>{Even as}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;s\)</i></b>. In proportion as <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 1:5)</i></b> and so<br>
 inasmuch as <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 1:7; Eph 1:4)</i></b>. <B>{The testimony of Christ}</B> <b><i>(\to<br>
 marturion tou Christou\)</i></b>. Objective genitive, the testimony to or<br>
 concerning Christ, the witness of Paul's preaching. <B>{Was<br>
 confirmed in you}</B> <b><i>(\ebebai&#333;th&#275; en humin\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 of \bebaio&#333;\, old verb from \bebaios\ and that from \bain&#333;\, to<br>
 make to stand, to make stable. These special gifts of the Holy<br>
 Spirit which they had so lavishly received <b><i>(ch. <!-#-->1Co 12)</i></b> were<br>
 for that very purpose.<br>
 <br>
 1:7 <B>{So that ye come behind in no gift}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;ste humas m&#275;<br>
 hustereisthai en m&#275;deni charismati\)</i></b>. Consecutive clause with<br>
 \h&#333;ste\ and the infinitive and the double negative. Come behind<br>
 <b><i>(\hustereisthai\)</i></b> is to be late <b><i>(\husteros\)</i></b>, old verb seen<br>
 already in <!-#-->Mr 10:21; Mt 19:20. It is a wonderful record here<br>
 recorded. But in <!-#-->2Co 8:7-11; 9:1-7 Paul will have to complain<br>
 that they have not paid their pledges for the collection, pledges<br>
 made over a year before, a very modern complaint. <B>{Waiting for<br>
 the revelation}</B> <b><i>(\apekdechomenous t&#275;n apokalupsin\)</i></b>. This double<br>
 compound is late and rare outside of Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 1:7; Ga 5:5; Ro<br>
 8:19,23,25; Php 3:20)</i></b>, <!-#-->1Pe 3:20; Heb 9:28. It is an eager<br>
 expectancy of the second coming of Christ here termed revelation<br>
 like the eagerness in \prosdechomenoi\ in <!-#-->Tit 2:13 for the same<br>
 event. "As if that attitude of expectation were the highest<br>
 posture that can be attained here by the Christian" <b><i>(F.W.<br>
 Robertson)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:8 <B>{Shall confirm}</B> <b><i>(\bebai&#333;sei\)</i></b>. Direct reference to the same<br>
 word in verse <!-#-->6. The relative \hos\ <b><i>(who)</i></b> points to Christ.<br>
 <B>{Unto the end}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s telous\)</i></b>. End of the age till Jesus comes,<br>
 final preservation of the saints. <B>{That ye be unreproveable}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anegkl&#275;tous\)</i></b>. Alpha privative and \egkale&#333;\, to accuse, old<br>
 verbal, only in Paul in N.T. Proleptic adjective in the predicate<br>
 accusative agreeing with \humas\ <b><i>(you)</i></b> without \h&#333;ste\ and the<br>
 infinitive as in <!-#-->1Th 3:13; 5:23; Php 3:21. "Unimpeachable, for<br>
 none will have the right to impeach" <b><i>(Robertson and Plummer)</i></b> as<br>
 Paul shows in <!-#-->Ro 8:33; Col 1:22,28.<br>
 <br>
 1:9 <B>{God is faithful}</B> <b><i>(\pistos ho theos\)</i></b>. This is the ground of<br>
 Paul's confidence as he loves to say <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 5:24; 1Co 10:13; Ro<br>
 8:36; Php 1:16)</i></b>. God will do what he has promised. <B>{Through<br>
 whom}</B> <b><i>(\di' hou\)</i></b>. God is the agent <b><i>(\di'\)</i></b> of their call as in<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 11:36 and also the ground or reason for their call <b><i>(\di'<br>
 hon\)</i></b> in <!-#-->Heb 2:10. <B>{Into the fellowship}</B> <b><i>(\eis koin&#333;nian\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 word from \koin&#333;nos\, partner for partnership, participation as<br>
 here and <!-#-->2Co 13:13f.; Php 2:1; 3:10. Then it means fellowship<br>
 or intimacy as in <!-#-->Ac 2:42; Ga 2:9; 2Co 6:14; 1Jo 1:3,7. And<br>
 particularly as shown by contribution as in <!-#-->2Co 8:4; 9:13; Php<br>
 1:5. It is high fellowship with Christ both here and hereafter.<br>
 <br>
 1:10 <B>{Now I beseech you}</B> <b><i>(\parakal&#333; de humas\)</i></b>. Old and common<br>
 verb, over 100 times in N.T., to call to one's side. Corresponds<br>
 here to \eucharist&#333;\, <B>{I thank}</B>, in verse <!-#-->4. Direct appeal<br>
 after the thanksgiving. <B>{Through the name}</B> <b><i>(\dia tou onomatos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive, not accusative <b><i>(cause or reason)</i></b>, as the medium or<br>
 instrument of the appeal <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 10:1; Ro 12:1; 15:30)</i></b>. <B>{That}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hina\)</i></b>. Purport <b><i>(sub-final)</i></b> rather than direct purpose, common<br>
 idiom in _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp.991-4)</i></b> like <!-#-->Mt<br>
 14:36. Used here with \leg&#275;te, &#275;i, &#275;te kat&#275;rtismenoi\, though<br>
 expressed only once. <B>{All speak}</B> <b><i>(\leg&#275;te pantes\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 active subjunctive, that ye all keep on speaking. With the<br>
 divisions in mind. An idiom from Greek political life<br>
 <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. This touch of the classical writers argues for<br>
 Paul's acquaintance with Greek culture. <B>{There be no divisions<br>
 among you}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; &#275;i en humin schismata\)</i></b>. Present subjunctive,<br>
 that divisions may not continue to be <b><i>(they already had them)</i></b>.<br>
 Negative statement of preceding idea. \Schisma\ is from \schiz&#333;\,<br>
 old word to split or rend, and so means a rent <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 9:16; Mr<br>
 2:21)</i></b>. Papyri use it for a splinter of wood and for ploughing.<br>
 Here we have the earliest instance of its use in a moral sense of<br>
 division, dissension, see also <!-#-->1Co 11:18 where a less complete<br>
 change than \haireseis\; <!-#-->12:25; Joh 7:43 <b><i>(discord)</i></b>; <!-#-->9:16;<br>
 10:19. "Here, faction, for which the classical word is \stasis\:<br>
 division within the Christian community" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. These<br>
 divisions were over the preachers <b><i>(<!-#-->1:12-4:21)</i></b>, immorality<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->5:1-13)</i></b>, going to law before the heathen <b><i>(<!-#-->6:1-11)</i></b>, marriage<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->7:1-40)</i></b>, meats offered to idols <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 8-10)</i></b>, conduct of women<br>
 in church <b><i>(<!-#-->11:1-16)</i></b>, the Lord's Supper <b><i>(<!-#-->11:17-34)</i></b>, spiritual<br>
 gifts <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 12-14)</i></b>, the resurrection <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15)</i></b>. <B>{But that ye be<br>
 perfected together}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;te de kat&#275;rtismenoi\)</i></b>. Periphrastic<br>
 perfect passive subjunctive. See this verb in <!-#-->Mt 4:21 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 1:19)</i></b> for mending torn nets and in moral sense already in <!-#-->1Th<br>
 3:10. Galen uses it for a surgeon's mending a joint and<br>
 Herodotus for composing factions. See <!-#-->2Co 13:11; Ga 6:1. <B>{Mind}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\noi\)</i></b>, <B>{judgment}</B> <b><i>(\gn&#333;m&#275;i\)</i></b>. "Of these words \nous\ denotes<br>
 the frame or state of mind, \gn&#333;m&#275;\ the judgment, opinion or<br>
 sentiment, which is the outcome of \nous\" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:11 <B>{For it hath been signified unto me}</B> <b><i>(\ed&#275;l&#333;th&#275; gar moi\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive indicative of \d&#275;lo&#333;\ and difficult to<br>
 render into English. Literally, It was signified to me. <B>{By them<br>
 of Chloe}</B> <b><i>(\hupo t&#333;n Chlo&#275;s\)</i></b>. Ablative case of the masculine<br>
 plural article \t&#333;n\, by the <b><i>(folks)</i></b> of Chloe <b><i>(genitive case)</i></b>.<br>
 The words "which are of the household" are not in the Greek,<br>
 though they correctly interpret the Greek, "those of Chloe."<br>
 Whether the children, the kinspeople, or the servants of Chloe we<br>
 do not know. It is uncertain also whether Chloe lived in Corinth<br>
 or Ephesus, probably Ephesus because to name her if in Corinth<br>
 might get her into trouble <b><i>(Heinrici)</i></b>. Already Christianity was<br>
 working a social revolution in the position of women and slaves.<br>
 The name <B>{Chloe}</B> means tender verdure and was one of the epithets<br>
 of Demeter the goddess of agriculture and for that reason<br>
 Lightfoot thinks that she was a member of the freedman class like<br>
 Phoebe <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 16:1)</i></b>, Hermes <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 16:14)</i></b>, Nereus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 16:15)</i></b>. It<br>
 is even possible that Stephanas, Fortunatus, Achaicus <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 16:17)</i></b> may have been those who brought Chloe the news of the<br>
 schisms in Corinth. <B>{Contentions}</B> <b><i>(\erides\)</i></b>. Unseemly wranglings<br>
 <b><i>(as opposed to discussing, \dialegomai\)</i></b> that were leading to the<br>
 <B>{schisms}</B>. Listed in works of the flesh <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 5:19f.)</i></b> and the<br>
 catalogues of vices <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 12:20; Ro 1:19f.; 1Ti 6:4)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:12 <B>{Now this I mean}</B> <b><i>(\leg&#333; de touto\)</i></b>. Explanatory use of<br>
 \leg&#333;\. Each has his party leader. \Apoll&#333;\ is genitive of<br>
 \Apoll&#333;s\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:24)</i></b>, probably abbreviation of \Apoll&#333;nius\ as<br>
 seen in Codex Bezae for <!-#-->Ac 18:24. See on Acts for discussion of<br>
 this "eloquent Alexandrian" <b><i>(Ellicott)</i></b>, whose philosophical and<br>
 oratorical preaching was in contrast "with the studied plainness"<br>
 of Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 2:1; 2Co 10:10)</i></b>. People naturally have different<br>
 tastes about styles of preaching and that is well, but Apollos<br>
 refused to be a party to this strife and soon returned to Ephesus<br>
 and refused to go back to Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 16:12)</i></b>. \C&#275;ph&#257;\ is the<br>
 genitive of \C&#275;ph&#257;s\, the Aramaic name given Simon by Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 1:42)</i></b>, \Petros\ in Greek. Except in <!-#-->Ga 2:7,8 Paul calls him<br>
 Cephas. He had already taken his stand with Paul in the Jerusalem<br>
 Conference <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:7-11; Ga 2:7-10)</i></b>. Paul had to rebuke him at<br>
 Antioch for his timidity because of the Judaizers <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 2:11-14)</i></b>,<br>
 but, in spite of Baur's theory, there is no evidence of a schism<br>
 in doctrine between Paul and Peter. If <!-#-->2Pe 3:15f. be accepted<br>
 as genuine, as I do, there is proof of cordial relations between<br>
 them and <!-#-->1Co 9:5 points in the same direction. But there is no<br>
 evidence that Peter himself visited Corinth. Judaizers came and<br>
 pitted Peter against Paul to the Corinthian Church on the basis<br>
 of Paul's rebuke of Peter in Antioch. These Judaizers made bitter<br>
 personal attacks on Paul in return for their defeat at the<br>
 Jerusalem Conference. So a third faction was formed by the use of<br>
 Peter's name as the really orthodox wing of the church, the<br>
 gospel of the circumcision. <B>{And I of Christ}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; de<br>
 Christou\)</i></b>. Still a fourth faction in recoil from the partisan<br>
 use of Paul, Apollos, Cephas, with "a spiritually proud<br>
 utterance" <b><i>(Ellicott)</i></b> that assumes a relation to Christ not true<br>
 of the others. "Those who used this cry arrogated the common<br>
 watchword as their _peculium_" <b><i>(Findlay)</i></b>. This partisan use of<br>
 the name of Christ may have been made in the name of unity<br>
 against the other three factions, but it merely added another<br>
 party to those existing. In scouting the names of the other<br>
 leaders they lowered the name and rank of Christ to their level.<br>
 <br>
 1:13 <B>{Is Christ divided?}</B> <b><i>(\memeristai ho Christos;\)</i></b>. Perfect<br>
 passive indicative, Does Christ stand divided? It is not certain,<br>
 though probable, that this is interrogative like the following<br>
 clauses. Hofmann calls the assertory form a "rhetorical<br>
 impossibility." The absence of \m&#275;\ here merely allows an<br>
 affirmative answer which is true. The fourth or Christ party<br>
 claimed to possess Christ in a sense not true of the others.<br>
 Perhaps the leaders of this Christ party with their arrogant<br>
 assumptions of superiority are the false apostles, ministers of<br>
 Satan posing as angels of light <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:12-15)</i></b>. <B>{Was Paul<br>
 crucified for you?}</B> <b><i>(\M&#275; Paulos estaur&#333;th&#275; huper hum&#333;n;\)</i></b>. An<br>
 indignant "No" is demanded by \m&#275;\. Paul shows his tact by<br>
 employing himself as the illustration, rather than Apollos or<br>
 Cephas. Probably \huper\, over, in behalf of, rather than \peri\<br>
 <b><i>(concerning, around)</i></b> is genuine, though either makes good sense<br>
 here. In the _Koin&#275;_ \huper\ encroaches on \peri\ as in <!-#-->2Th<br>
 2:1. <B>{Were ye baptized into the name of Paul?}</B> <b><i>(\eis to onoma<br>
 Paulou ebaptisth&#275;te;\)</i></b>. It is unnecessary to say <B>{into}</B> for \eis\<br>
 rather than <B>{in}</B> since \eis\ is the same preposition originally<br>
 as \en\ and both are used with \baptiz&#333;\ as in <!-#-->Ac 8:16; 10:48<br>
 with no difference in idea <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 592)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 evidently knows the idea in <!-#-->Mt 28:19 and scouts the notion of<br>
 being put on a par with Christ or the Trinity. He is no rival of<br>
 Christ. This use of \onoma\ for the person is not only in the<br>
 LXX, but the papyri, ostraca, and inscriptions give numerous<br>
 examples of the name of the king or the god for the power and<br>
 authority of the king or god <b><i>(Deissmann, _Bible Studies_, pp.<br>
 146ff., 196ff.; _Light from the Ancient East_, p. 121)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:14 <B>{I thank God}</B> <b><i>(\eucharist&#333; t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>. See verse <!-#-->4,<br>
 though uncertain if \t&#333;i the&#333;i\ is genuine here. <B>{Save Crispus<br>
 and Gaius}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275; Krispon kai Gaion\)</i></b>. Crispus was the ruler of<br>
 the synagogue in Corinth before his conversion <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:8)</i></b>, a<br>
 Roman cognomen, and Gaius a Roman praenomen, probably the host of<br>
 Paul and of the whole church in Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 16:23)</i></b>, possibly<br>
 though not clearly the hospitable Gaius of <!-#-->3Jo 1:5,6. The<br>
 prominence and importance of these two may explain why Paul<br>
 baptized them.<br>
 <br>
 1:15 <B>{Lest any man should say}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275; tis eip&#275;i\)</i></b>. Certainly<br>
 sub-final \hina\ again or contemplated result as in <!-#-->7:29; Joh<br>
 9:2. Ellicott thinks that already some in Corinth were laying<br>
 emphasis on the person of the baptizer whether Peter or some one<br>
 else. It is to be recalled that Jesus himself baptized no one<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 4:2)</i></b> to avoid this very kind of controversy. And yet there<br>
 are those today who claim Paul as a sacramentalist, an impossible<br>
 claim in the light of his words here.<br>
 <br>
 1:16 <B>{Also the household of Stephanas}</B> <b><i>(\kai ton Stephan&#257;<br>
 oikon\)</i></b>. Mentioned as an afterthought. Robertson and Plummer<br>
 suggest that Paul's amanuensis reminded him of this case. Paul<br>
 calls him a first-fruit of Achaia <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 16:15)</i></b> and so earlier<br>
 than Crispus and he was one of the three who came to Paul from<br>
 Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->16:17)</i></b>, clearly a family that justified Paul's<br>
 personal attention about baptism. <B>{Besides}</B> <b><i>(\loipon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Accusative of general reference, "as for anything else." Added to<br>
 make clear that he is not meaning to omit any one who deserves<br>
 mention. See also <!-#-->1Th 4:1; 1Co 4:2; 2Co 13:11; 2Ti 4:8.<br>
 Ellicott insists on a sharp distinction from \to loipon\ "as for<br>
 the rest" <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 3:1; Php 3:1; 4:8; Eph 6:10)</i></b>. Paul casts no<br>
 reflection on baptism, for he could not with his conception of it<br>
 as the picture of the new life in Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 6:2-6)</i></b>, but he<br>
 clearly denies here that he considers baptism essential to the<br>
 remission of sin or the means of obtaining forgiveness.<br>
 <br>
 1:17 <B>{For Christ sent me not to baptize}</B> <b><i>(\ou gar apesteilen me<br>
 Christos baptizein\)</i></b>. The negative \ou\ goes not with the<br>
 infinitive, but with \apesteilen\ <b><i>(from \apostell&#333;, apostolos\,<br>
 apostle)</i></b>. <B>{For Christ did not send me to be a baptizer}</B> <b><i>(present<br>
 active infinitive, linear action)</i></b> like John the Baptist. <B>{But to<br>
 preach the gospel}</B> <b><i>(\alla euaggelizesthai\)</i></b>. This is Paul's idea<br>
 of his mission from Christ, as Christ's apostle, to be <B>{a<br>
 gospelizer}</B>. This led, of course, to baptism, as a result, but<br>
 Paul usually had it done by others as Peter at Caesarea ordered<br>
 the baptism to be done, apparently by the six brethren with him<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10:48)</i></b>. Paul is fond of this late Greek verb from<br>
 \euaggelion\ and sometimes uses both verb and substantive as in<br>
 <!-#-->1Co 15:1 "the gospel which I gospelized unto you." <B>{Not in<br>
 wisdom of words}</B> <b><i>(\ouk en sophi&#257;i logou\)</i></b>. Note \ou\, not \m&#275;\<br>
 <b><i>(the subjective negative)</i></b>, construed with \apesteilen\ rather<br>
 than the infinitive. Not in wisdom of speech <b><i>(singular)</i></b>.<br>
 Preaching was Paul's forte, but it was not as a pretentious<br>
 philosopher or professional rhetorician that Paul appeared before<br>
 the Corinthians <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 2:1-5)</i></b>. Some who followed Apollos may have<br>
 been guilty of a fancy for external show, though Apollos was not<br>
 a mere performer and juggler with words. But the Alexandrian<br>
 method as in Philo did run to dialectic subtleties and luxuriant<br>
 rhetoric <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. <B>{Lest the cross of Christ should be made<br>
 void}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275; ken&#333;th&#275;i ho stauros tou Christou\)</i></b>. Negative<br>
 purpose <b><i>(\hina m&#275;\)</i></b> with first aorist passive subjunctive,<br>
 effective aorist, of \keno&#333;\, old verb from \kenos\, to make<br>
 empty. In Paul's preaching the Cross of Christ is the central<br>
 theme. Hence Paul did not fall into the snare of too much<br>
 emphasis on baptism nor into too little on the death of Christ.<br>
 "This expression shows clearly the stress which St. Paul laid on<br>
 the death of Christ, not merely as a great moral spectacle, and<br>
 so the crowning point of a life of self-renunciation, but as in<br>
 itself the ordained instrument of salvation" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:18 <B>{For the word of the cross}</B> <b><i>(\ho logos gar ho tou staurou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "for the preaching <b><i>(with which I am concerned as the<br>
 opposite of <B>{wisdom of word}</B> in verse <!-#-->17)</i></b> that <b><i>(repeated<br>
 article \ho\, almost demonstrative)</i></b> of the cross." "Through this<br>
 incidental allusion to preaching St. Paul passes to a new<br>
 subject. The discussions in the Corinthian Church are for a time<br>
 forgotten, and he takes the opportunity of correcting his<br>
 converts for their undue exaltation of human eloquence and<br>
 wisdom" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. <B>{To them that are perishing}</B> <b><i>(\tois men<br>
 apollumenois\)</i></b>. Dative of disadvantage <b><i>(personal interest)</i></b>.<br>
 Present middle participle is here timeless, those in the path to<br>
 destruction <b><i>(not annihilation. See <!-#-->2Th 2:10)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->2Co 4:3.<br>
 <B>{Foolishness}</B> <b><i>(\m&#333;ria\)</i></b>. Folly. Old word from \m&#333;ros\, foolish.<br>
 In N.T. only in <!-#-->1Co 1:18,21,23; 2:14; 3:19. <B>{But unto us which<br>
 are being saved}</B> <b><i>(\tois s&#333;zomenois h&#275;min\)</i></b>. Sharp contrast to<br>
 those that are perishing and same construction with the articular<br>
 participle. No reason for the change of pronouns in English. This<br>
 present passive participle is again timeless. Salvation is<br>
 described by Paul as a thing done in the past, "we were saved"<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 8:24)</i></b>, as a present state, "ye have been saved" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ep 2:5)</i></b>,<br>
 as a process, "ye are being saved" <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:2)</i></b>, as a future<br>
 result, "thou shalt be saved" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 10:9)</i></b>. <B>{The power of God}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dunamis theou\)</i></b>. So in <!-#-->Ro 1:16. No other message has this<br>
 dynamite of God <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 4:20)</i></b>. God's power is shown in the<br>
 preaching of the Cross of Christ through all the ages, now as<br>
 always. No other preaching wins men and women from sin to<br>
 holiness or can save them. The judgment of Paul here is the<br>
 verdict of every soul winner through all time.<br>
 <br>
 1:19 <B>{I will destroy}</B> <b><i>(\apol&#333;\)</i></b>. Future active indicative of<br>
 \apollumi\. Attic future for \apoles&#333;\. Quotation from <!-#-->Isa<br>
 29:14 <b><i>(LXX)</i></b>. The failure of worldly statesmanship in the<br>
 presence of Assyrian invasion Paul applies to his argument with<br>
 force. The wisdom of the wise is often folly, the understanding<br>
 of the understanding is often rejected. There is such a thing as<br>
 the ignorance of the learned, the wisdom of the simple-minded.<br>
 God's wisdom rises in the Cross sheer above human philosophizing<br>
 which is still scoffing at the Cross of Christ, the consummation<br>
 of God's power.<br>
 <br>
 1:20 <B>{Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the<br>
 disputer of this world?}</B> <b><i>(\Pou sophos; pou grammateus; pou<br>
 sunz&#275;t&#275;t&#275;s tou ai&#333;nos toutou;\)</i></b>. Paul makes use of <!-#-->Isa 33:18<br>
 without exact quotation. The sudden retreat of Sennacherib with<br>
 the annihilation of his officers. "On the tablet of Shalmaneser<br>
 in the Assyrian Gallery of the British Museum there is a<br>
 surprisingly exact picture of the scene described by Isaiah"<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson and Plummer)</i></b>. Note the absence of the Greek article in<br>
 each of these rhetorical questions though the idea is clearly<br>
 definite. Probably \sophos\ refers to the Greek philosopher,<br>
 \grammateus\ to the Jewish scribe and \sunz&#275;t&#275;t&#275;s\ suits both the<br>
 Greek and the Jewish disputant and doubter <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 6:9; 9:29; 17:18;<br>
 28:29)</i></b>. There is a note of triumph in these questions. The word<br>
 \sunz&#275;t&#275;t&#275;s\ occurs here alone in the N.T. and elsewhere only in<br>
 Ignatius, Eph. 18 quoting this passage, but the papyri give the<br>
 verb \sunz&#275;te&#333;\ for disputing <b><i>(questioning together)</i></b>. <B>{Hath not<br>
 God made foolish?}</B> <b><i>(\ouchi em&#333;ranen ho theos;\)</i></b>. Strong negative<br>
 form with aorist active indicative difficult of precise<br>
 translation, "Did not God make foolish?" The old verb \m&#333;rain&#333;\<br>
 from \m&#333;ros\, foolish, was to be foolish, to act foolish, then to<br>
 prove one foolish as here or to make foolish as in <!-#-->Ro 1:22. In<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 5:13; Lu 14:34 it is used of salt that is tasteless. <B>{World}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kosmou\)</i></b>. Synonymous with \ai&#333;n\ <b><i>(age)</i></b>, orderly arrangement,<br>
 then the non-Christian cosmos.<br>
 <br>
 1:21 <B>{Seeing that}</B> <b><i>(\epeid&#275;\)</i></b>. Since <b><i>(\epei\ and \d&#275;\)</i></b> with<br>
 explanatory \gar\. <B>{Through its wisdom}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#275;s sophias\)</i></b>.<br>
 Article here as possessive. The two wisdoms contrasted. <B>{Knew not<br>
 God}</B> <b><i>(\ouk egn&#333;\)</i></b>. Failed to know, second aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b><br>
 active indicative of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\, solemn dirge of doom on both<br>
 Greek philosophy and Jewish theology that failed to know God. Has<br>
 modern philosophy done better? There is today even a godless<br>
 theology <b><i>(Humanism)</i></b>. "Now that God's wisdom has reduced the<br>
 self-wise world to ignorance" <b><i>(Findlay)</i></b>. <B>{Through the foolishness<br>
 of the preaching}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#275;s m&#333;rias tou k&#275;rugmatos\)</i></b>. Perhaps<br>
 "proclamation" is the idea, for it is not \k&#275;ruxis\, the act of<br>
 heralding, but \k&#275;rugma\, the message heralded or the<br>
 proclamation as in verse <!-#-->23. The metaphor is that of the herald<br>
 proclaiming the approach of the king <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 3:1; 4:17)</i></b>. See also<br>
 \k&#275;rugma\ in <!-#-->1Co 2:4; 2Ti 4:17. The proclamation of the Cross<br>
 seemed foolishness to the wiseacres then <b><i>(and now)</i></b>, but it is<br>
 consummate wisdom, God's wisdom and good-pleasure <b><i>(\eudok&#275;san\)</i></b>.<br>
 The foolishness of preaching is not the preaching of foolishness.<br>
 <B>{To save them that believe}</B> <b><i>(\s&#333;sai tous pisteuontas\)</i></b>. This is<br>
 the heart of God's plan of redemption, the proclamation of<br>
 salvation for all those who trust Jesus Christ on the basis of<br>
 his death for sin on the Cross. The mystery-religions all offered<br>
 salvation by initiation and ritual as the Pharisees did by<br>
 ceremonialism. Christianity reaches the heart directly by trust<br>
 in Christ as the Saviour. It is God's wisdom.<br>
 <br>
 1:22 <B>{Seeing that}</B> <b><i>(\epeid&#275;\)</i></b>. Resumes from verse <!-#-->21. The<br>
 structure is not clear, but probably verses <!-#-->23,24 form a sort<br>
 of conclusion or apodosis to verse <!-#-->22 the protasis. The<br>
 resumptive, almost inferential, use of \de\ like \alla\ in the<br>
 apodosis is not unusual. <B>{Ask for signs}</B> <b><i>(\s&#275;meia aitousin\)</i></b>. The<br>
 Jews often came to Jesus asking for signs <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 12:38; 16:1; Joh<br>
 6:30)</i></b>. <B>{Seek after wisdom}</B> <b><i>(\sophian z&#275;tousin\)</i></b>. "The Jews<br>
 claimed to _possess_ the truth: the Greeks were seekers,<br>
 _speculators_" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Ac 17:23.<br>
 <br>
 1:23 <B>{But we preach Christ crucified}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meis de k&#275;russomen<br>
 Christon estaur&#333;menon\)</i></b>. Grammatically stated as a partial result<br>
 <b><i>(\de\)</i></b> of the folly of both Jews and Greeks, actually in sharp<br>
 contrast. We proclaim, "we do not discuss or dispute"<br>
 <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. Christ <b><i>(Messiah)</i></b> as crucified, as in <!-#-->2:2; Ga 3:1,<br>
 "not a sign-shower nor a philosopher" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle of \stauro&#333;\. <B>{Stumbling-block}</B> <b><i>(\skandalon\)</i></b>. Papyri<br>
 examples mean trap or snare which here tripped the Jews who<br>
 wanted a conquering Messiah with a world empire, not a condemned<br>
 and crucified one <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:42; Lu 24:21)</i></b>. <B>{Foolishness}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\m&#333;rian\)</i></b>. Folly as shown by their conduct in Athens <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 17:32)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 1:24 <B>{But to them that are called}</B> <b><i>(\autois de tois kl&#275;tois\)</i></b>.<br>
 Dative case, to the called themselves. <B>{Christ}</B> <b><i>(\Christon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Accusative case repeated, object of \k&#275;russomen\, both <B>{the power<br>
 of God}</B> <b><i>(\theou dunamin\)</i></b> and <B>{the wisdom of God}</B> <b><i>(\theou<br>
 sophian\)</i></b>. No article, but made definite by the genitive. Christ<br>
 crucified is God's answer to both Jew and Greek and the answer is<br>
 understood by those with open minds.<br>
 <br>
 1:25 <B>{The foolishness of God}</B> <b><i>(\to m&#333;ron tou theou\)</i></b>. Abstract<br>
 neuter singular with the article, the foolish act of God <b><i>(the<br>
 Cross as regarded by the world)</i></b>. <B>{Wiser than men}</B> <b><i>(\soph&#333;teron<br>
 t&#333;n anthr&#333;p&#333;n\)</i></b>. Condensed comparison, wiser than the wisdom of<br>
 men. Common Greek idiom <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:20; Joh 5:36)</i></b> and quite forcible,<br>
 brushes all men aside. <B>{The weakness of God}</B> <b><i>(\to asthenes tou<br>
 theou\)</i></b>. Same idiom here, <B>{the weak act of God}</B>, as men think,<br>
 <B>{is stronger}</B> <b><i>(\ischuroteron\)</i></b>. The Cross seemed God's defeat. It<br>
 is conquering the world and is the mightiest force on earth.<br>
 <br>
 1:26 <B>{Behold}</B> <b><i>(\blepete\)</i></b>. Same form for imperative present<br>
 active plural and indicative. Either makes sense as in <!-#-->Joh 5:39<br>
 \eraunate\ and <!-#-->14:1 \pisteuete\. <B>{Calling}</B> <b><i>(\kl&#275;sin\)</i></b>. The act<br>
 of calling by God, based not on the external condition of those<br>
 called <b><i>(\kl&#275;toi\, verse <!-#-->2)</i></b>, but on God's sovereign love. It is<br>
 a clinching illustration of Paul's argument, an _argumentum ad<br>
 hominen_. <B>{How that}</B> <b><i>(\hoti\)</i></b>. Explanatory apposition to<br>
 \kl&#275;sin\. <B>{After the flesh}</B> <b><i>(\kata sarka\)</i></b>. According to the<br>
 standards of the flesh and to be used not only with \sophoi\<br>
 <b><i>(wise, philosophers)</i></b>, but also \dunatoi\ <b><i>(men of dignity and<br>
 power)</i></b>, \eugeneis\ <b><i>(noble, high birth)</i></b>, the three claims to<br>
 aristocracy <b><i>(culture, power, birth)</i></b>. <B>{Are called}</B>. Not in the<br>
 Greek, but probably to be supplied from the idea in \kl&#275;sin\.<br>
 <br>
 1:27 <B>{God chose}</B> <b><i>(\exelexato ho theos\)</i></b>. First aorist middle of<br>
 \ekleg&#333;\, old verb to pick out, to choose, the middle for<br>
 oneself. It expands the idea in \kl&#275;sin\ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->26)</i></b>. Three<br>
 times this solemn verb occurs here with the purpose stated each<br>
 time. Twice the same purpose is expressed, <B>{that he might put to<br>
 shame}</B> <b><i>(\hina kataischun&#275;i\, first aorist active subjunctive with<br>
 \hina\ of old verb \kataischun&#333;\, perfective use of \kata\)</i></b>. The<br>
 purpose in the third example is <B>{that he might bring to naught}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hina katarg&#275;s&#275;i\, make idle, \argos\, rare in old Greek, but<br>
 frequent in Paul)</i></b>. The contrast is complete in each paradox: <B>{the<br>
 foolish things}</B> <b><i>(\ta m&#333;ra\)</i></b>, <B>{the wild men}</B> <b><i>(\tous sophous\)</i></b>;<br>
 <B>{the weak things}</B> <b><i>(\ta asthen&#275;\)</i></b>, <B>{the strong things}</B> <b><i>(\ta<br>
 ischura\)</i></b>; <B>{the things that are not}</B> <b><i>(\ta m&#275; onta\)</i></b>, <B>{and that<br>
 are despised}</B> <b><i>(\ta exouthen&#275;mena\, considered nothing, perfect<br>
 passive participle of \exouthene&#333;\)</i></b>, <B>{the things that are}</B> <b><i>(\ta<br>
 onta\)</i></b>. It is a studied piece of rhetoric and powerfully put.<br>
 <br>
 1:29 <B>{That no flesh should glory before God}</B> <b><i>(\hop&#333;s m&#275;<br>
 kauch&#275;s&#275;tai p&#257;sa sarx en&#333;pion tou theou\)</i></b>. This is the further<br>
 purpose expressed by \hop&#333;s\ for variety and appeals to God's<br>
 ultimate choice in all three instances. The first aorist middle<br>
 of the old verb \kauchaomai\, to boast, brings out sharply that<br>
 not a single boast is to be made. The papyri give numerous<br>
 examples of \en&#333;pion\ as a preposition in the vernacular, from<br>
 adjective \en-&#333;pios\, in the eye of God. One should turn to <!-#-->2Co<br>
 4:7 for Paul's further statement about our having this treasure<br>
 in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God<br>
 and not of us.<br>
 <br>
 1:30 <B>{Of him}</B> <b><i>(\ex autou\)</i></b>. Out of God. He chose you. <B>{In Christ<br>
 Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\en Christ&#333;i I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. In the sphere of Christ Jesus the<br>
 choice was made. This is God's wisdom. <B>{Who was made unto us<br>
 wisdom from God}</B> <b><i>(\hos egen&#275;th&#275; sophia h&#275;min apo theou\)</i></b>. Note<br>
 \egen&#275;th&#275;\, became <b><i>(first aorist passive and indicative)</i></b>, not<br>
 \&#275;n\, was, the Incarnation, Cross, and Resurrection. Christ is<br>
 the wisdom of God <b><i>(<!-#-->Co 2:2f.)</i></b> "both righteousness and<br>
 sanctification and redemption" <b><i>(\dikaiosun&#275; te kai hagiasmos kai<br>
 apolutr&#333;sis\)</i></b>, as is made plain by the use of \te--kai--kai\. The<br>
 three words <b><i>(\dikaiosun&#275;, hagiasmos, apolutr&#333;sis\)</i></b> are thus shown<br>
 to be an epexegesis of \sophia\ <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. All the treasures of<br>
 wisdom and knowledge in Christ Jesus. We are made righteous,<br>
 holy, and redeemed in Christ Jesus. Redemption comes here last<br>
 for emphasis though the foundation of the other two. In <!-#-->Ro 1:17<br>
 we see clearly Paul's idea of the God kind of righteousness<br>
 <b><i>(\dikaiosun&#275;\)</i></b> in Christ. In <!-#-->Ro 3:24 we have Paul's conception<br>
 of redemption <b><i>(\apolutr&#333;sis\, setting free as a ransomed slave)</i></b><br>
 in Christ. In <!-#-->Ro 6:19 we have Paul's notion of holiness or<br>
 sanctification <b><i>(\hagiasmos\)</i></b> in Christ. These great theological<br>
 terms will call for full discussion in Romans, but they must not<br>
 be overlooked here. See also <!-#-->Ac 10:35; 24:25; 1Th 4:3-7; 1Co<br>
 1:2.<br>
 <br>
 1:31 <B>{That}</B> <b><i>(\hina\)</i></b>. Probably ellipse <b><i>(\gen&#275;tai\ to be supplied)</i></b><br>
 as is common in Paul's Epistles <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 2:3; 2Co 8:13; Ga 1:20;<br>
 2:9; Ro 4:16; 13:1; 15:3)</i></b>. Some explain the imperative<br>
 \kauchasth&#333;\ as an anacoluthon. The shortened quotation is from<br>
 <!-#-->Jer 9:24. Deissmann notes the importance of these closing<br>
 verses concerning the origin of Paul's congregations from the<br>
 lower classes in the large towns as "one of the most important<br>
 historical witnesses to Primitive Christianity" <b><i>(_New Light on<br>
 the N.T._, p. 7; _Light from the Ancient East_, pp. 7, 14, 60,<br>
 142)</i></b>.<br>
