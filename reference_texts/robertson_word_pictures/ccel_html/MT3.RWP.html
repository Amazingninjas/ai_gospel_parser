<p>3:1 <B>{And in those days cometh John the Baptist}</B> <b><i>(\en de tais<br>
 h&#275;merais paraginetai I&#333;an&#275;s ho Baptist&#275;s\)</i></b>. Here the synoptic<br>
 narrative begins with the baptism of John <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt. 3:1; Mr 1:2; Lu<br>
 3:1)</i></b> as given by Peter in <!-#-->Ac 1:22, "from the baptism of John,<br>
 unto the day that he was received up from us" <b><i>(cf. also <!-#-->Ac<br>
 10:37-43, Peter's summary to Cornelius very much like the<br>
 outline of Mark's Gospel)</i></b>. Matthew does not indicate the date<br>
 when John appeared as Luke does in ch. 3 <b><i>(the fifteenth year of<br>
 Tiberius's reign)</i></b>. It was some thirty years after the birth of<br>
 John, precisely how long after the return of Joseph and Mary to<br>
 Nazareth we do not know. Moffatt translates the verb<br>
 <b><i>(\paraginetai\)</i></b> "came on the scene," but it is the historical<br>
 present and calls for a vivid imagination on the part of the<br>
 reader. There he is as he comes forward, makes his appearance.<br>
 His name John means "Gift of Jehovah" <b><i>(cf. German _Gotthold_)</i></b> and<br>
 is a shortened form of Johanan. He is described as "the Baptist,"<br>
 "the Baptizer" for that is the rite that distinguishes him. The<br>
 Jews probably had proselyte baptism as I. Abrahams shows<br>
 <b><i>(_Studies in Pharisaism and the Gospels_, p. 37)</i></b>. But this rite<br>
 was meant for the Gentiles who accepted Judaism. John is treating<br>
 the Jews as Gentiles in demanding baptism at their hands on the<br>
 basis of repentance.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Preaching in the wilderness of Judea}</B> <b><i>(\K&#275;russ&#333;n en t&#275;i er&#275;m&#333;i<br>
 t&#275;s Ioudaias\)</i></b>. It was the rough region in the hills toward the<br>
 Jordan and the Dead Sea. There were some people scattered over<br>
 the barren cliffs. Here John came in close touch with the rocks,<br>
 the trees, the goats, the sheep, and the shepherds, the snakes<br>
 that slipped before the burning grass over the rocks. He was the<br>
 Baptizer, but he was also the Preacher, heralding his message out<br>
 in the barren hills at first where few people were, but soon his<br>
 startling message drew crowds from far and near. Some preachers<br>
 start with crowds and drive them away.<br>
 <br>
 3:2 <B>{Repent}</B> <b><i>(\metanoeite\)</i></b>. Broadus used to say that this is the<br>
 worst translation in the New Testament. The trouble is that the<br>
 English word "repent" means "to be sorry again" from the Latin<br>
 _repoenitet_ <b><i>(impersonal)</i></b>. John did not call on the people to be<br>
 sorry, but to change <b><i>(think afterwards)</i></b> their mental attitudes<br>
 <b><i>(\metanoeite\)</i></b> and conduct. The Vulgate has it "do penance" and<br>
 Wycliff has followed that. The Old Syriac has it better: "Turn<br>
 ye." The French <b><i>(Geneva)</i></b> has it "Amendez vous." This is John's<br>
 great word <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b> and it has been hopelessly mistranslated. The<br>
 tragedy of it is that we have no one English word that reproduces<br>
 exactly the meaning and atmosphere of the Greek word. The Greek<br>
 has a word meaning to be sorry <b><i>(\metamelomai\)</i></b> which is exactly<br>
 our English word repent and it is used of Judas <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:3)</i></b>. John<br>
 was a new prophet with the call of the old prophets: "Turn ye"<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joe 2:12; Isa. 55:7; Eze 33:11,15)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{For the kingdom of heaven is at hand}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;ggiken gar h&#275; Basileia<br>
 t&#333;n ouran&#333;n\)</i></b>. Note the position of the verb and the present<br>
 perfect tense. It was a startling word that John thundered over<br>
 the hills and it re-echoed throughout the land. The Old Testament<br>
 prophets had said that it would come some day in God's own time.<br>
 John proclaims as the herald of the new day that it has come, has<br>
 drawn near. How near he does not say, but he evidently means very<br>
 near, so near that one could see the signs and the proof. The<br>
 words "the kingdom of heaven" he does not explain. The other<br>
 Gospels use "the kingdom of God" as Matthew does a few times, but<br>
 he has "the kingdom of heaven" over thirty times. He means "the<br>
 reign of God," not the political or ecclesiastical organization<br>
 which the Pharisees expected. His words would be understood<br>
 differently by different groups as is always true of popular<br>
 preachers. The current Jewish apocalypses had numerous<br>
 eschatological ideas connected with the kingdom of heaven. It is<br>
 not clear what sympathy John had with these eschatological<br>
 features. He employs vivid language at times, but we do not have<br>
 to confine John's intellectual and theological horizon to that of<br>
 the rabbis of his day. He has been an original student of the Old<br>
 Testament in his wilderness environment without any necessary<br>
 contact with the Essenes who dwelt there. His voice is a new one<br>
 that strikes terror to the perfunctory theologians of the temple<br>
 and of the synagogue. It is the fashion of some critics to deny<br>
 to John any conception of the spiritual content of his words, a<br>
 wholly gratuitous criticism.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{For this is he that was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\houtos gar estin ho rh&#275;theis dia Esaiou tou proph&#275;tou\)</i></b>. This<br>
 is Matthew's way of interpreting the mission and message of the<br>
 Baptist. He quotes <!-#-->Isa 40:3 where "the prophet refers to the<br>
 return of Israel from the exile, accompanied by their God"<br>
 <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. He applies it to the work of John as "a voice crying<br>
 in the wilderness" for the people to make ready the way of the<br>
 Lord who is now near. He was only a voice, but what a voice he<br>
 was. He can be heard yet across the centuries.<br>
 <br>
 3:4 <B>{Now John himself}</B> <b><i>(\autos de ho I&#333;an&#275;s\)</i></b>. Matthew thus<br>
 introduces the man himself and draws a vivid sketch of his dress<br>
 <b><i>(note \eichen\, imperfect tense)</i></b>, his habit, and his food. Would<br>
 such an uncouth figure be welcome today in any pulpit in our<br>
 cities? In the wilderness it did not matter. It was probably a<br>
 matter of necessity with him, not an affectation, though it was<br>
 the garb of the original Elijah <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ki 1:8)</i></b>, rough sackcloth<br>
 woven from the hair of camels. Plummer holds that "John<br>
 consciously took Elijah as a model."<br>
 <br>
 3:6 <B>{And they were baptized}</B> <b><i>(\kai ebaptizonto\)</i></b>. It is the<br>
 imperfect tense to show the repetition of the act as the crowds<br>
 from Judea and the surrounding country kept going out to him<br>
 <b><i>(\exeporeueto\)</i></b>, imperfect again, a regular stream of folks going<br>
 forth. Moffatt takes it as causative middle, "got baptized,"<br>
 which is possible. "The movement of course was gradual. It began<br>
 on a small scale and steadily grew till it reached colossal<br>
 proportions" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. It is a pity that baptism is now such a<br>
 matter of controversy. Let Plummer, the great Church of England<br>
 commentator on Matthew, speak here of John's baptising these<br>
 people who came in throngs: "It is his office to bind them to a<br>
 new life, symbolized by immersion in water." That is correct,<br>
 symbolized, not caused or obtained. The word "river" is in the<br>
 correct text, "river Jordan." They came "confessing their sins"<br>
 <b><i>(\exomologoumenoi\)</i></b>, probably each one confessing just before he<br>
 was baptized, "making open confession" <b><i>(Weymouth)</i></b>. Note \ex\. It<br>
 was a never to be forgotten scene here in the Jordan. John was<br>
 calling a nation to a new life. They came from all over Judea and<br>
 even from the other side of El Ghor <b><i>(the Jordan Gorge)</i></b>, Perea.<br>
 Mark adds that finally all Jerusalem came.<br>
 <br>
 3:7 <B>{The Pharisees and Sadducees}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n Pharisai&#333;n kai<br>
 Saddoukai&#333;n\)</i></b>. These two rival parties do not often unite in<br>
 common action, but do again in <!-#-->Mt 16:1. "Here a strong<br>
 attraction, there a strong repulsion, made them for the moment<br>
 forget their differences" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. John saw these rival<br>
 ecclesiastics "coming for baptism" <b><i>(\erchomenous epi to<br>
 baptisma\)</i></b>. Alford speaks of "the Pharisees representing<br>
 hypocritical superstition; the Sadducees carnal unbelief." One<br>
 cannot properly understand the theological atmosphere of<br>
 Palestine at this time without an adequate knowledge of both<br>
 Pharisees and Sadducees. The books are numerous besides articles<br>
 in the Bible dictionaries. I have pictured the Pharisees in my<br>
 first <b><i>(1916)</i></b> Stone Lectures, _The Pharisees and Jesus_. John<br>
 clearly grasped the significance of this movement on the part of<br>
 the Pharisees and Sadducees who had followed the crowds to the<br>
 Jordan. He had welcomed the multitudes, but right in the presence<br>
 of the crowds he exposes the hypocrisy of the ecclesiastics. <B>{Ye<br>
 offspring of vipers}</B> <b><i>(\genn&#275;mata echidn&#333;n\)</i></b>. Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 12:34;<br>
 23:33)</i></b> will use the same language to the Pharisees. Broods of<br>
 snakes were often seen by John in the rocks and when a fire broke<br>
 out they would scurry <b><i>(\phugein\)</i></b> to their holes for safety. "The<br>
 coming wrath" was not just for Gentiles as the Jews supposed, but<br>
 for all who were not prepared for the kingdom of heaven <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th<br>
 1:10)</i></b>. No doubt the Pharisees and Sadducees winced under the<br>
 sting of this powerful indictment.<br>
 <br>
 3:8 <B>{Fruit worthy of repentance}</B> <b><i>(\Karpon axion t&#275;s metanoias\)</i></b>.<br>
 John demands proof from these men of the new life before he<br>
 administers baptism to them. "The fruit is not the change of<br>
 heart, but the acts which result from it" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. It was a<br>
 bold deed for John thus to challenge as unworthy the very ones<br>
 who posed as lights and leaders of the Jewish people. "Any one<br>
 can do <b><i>(\poi&#275;sate, vide\ <!-#-->Ge 1:11)</i></b> acts externally good but only<br>
 a good man can grow a crop of right acts and habits" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:9 <B>{And think not to say within yourselves}</B> <b><i>(\kai m&#275; dox&#275;te<br>
 legein en heautois\)</i></b>. John touched the tender spot, their<br>
 ecclesiastical pride. They felt that the "merits of the fathers,"<br>
 especially of Abraham, were enough for all Israelites. At once<br>
 John made clear that, reformer as he was, a breach existed<br>
 between him and the religious leaders of the time. <B>{Of these<br>
 stones}</B> <b><i>(\ek t&#333;n lith&#333;n tout&#333;n\)</i></b>. "Pointing, as he spoke to the<br>
 pebbles on the beach of the Jordan" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 3:10 <B>{Is the axe laid}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; axin&#275; keitai\)</i></b>. This verb \keitai\ is<br>
 used as the perfect passive of \tith&#275;mi\. But the idea really is,<br>
 "the axe lies at <b><i>(\pros\, before)</i></b> the root of the trees." It is<br>
 there ready for business. The prophetic present occurs also with<br>
 "is hewn down" and "cast."<br>
 <br>
 3:11 <B>{Mightier than I}</B> <b><i>(\ischuroteros mou\)</i></b>. Ablative after the<br>
 comparative adjective. His baptism is water baptism, but the<br>
 Coming One "will baptize in the Holy Spirit and fire." "Life in<br>
 the coming age is in the sphere of the Spirit. Spirit and fire<br>
 are coupled with one preposition as a double baptism" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 Broadus takes "fire" in the sense of separation like the use of<br>
 the fan. As the humblest of servants John felt unworthy to take<br>
 off the sandals of the Coming One. About \bastaz&#333;\ see on &#175;Mt<br>
 8:17.<br>
 <br>
 3:12 <B>{Will burn up with unquenchable fire}</B> <b><i>(\katakausei puri<br>
 asbest&#333;i\)</i></b>. Note perfective use of \kata\. The threshing floor,<br>
 the fan, the wheat, the garner, the chaff <b><i>(\achuron\, chaff,<br>
 straw, stubble)</i></b>, the fire furnish a life-like picture. The "fire"<br>
 here is probably judgment by and at the coming of the Messiah<br>
 just as in verse <!-#-->11. The Messiah "will thoroughly cleanse"<br>
 <b><i>(\diakathariei\, Attic future of \-iz&#333;\ and note \dia-\)</i></b>. He will<br>
 sweep from side to side to make it clean.<br>
 <br>
 3:13 <B>{Then cometh Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\tote paraginetai ho I&#275;sous\)</i></b>. The same<br>
 historical present used in <!-#-->3:1. He comes all the way from<br>
 Galilee to Jordan "to be baptized by him" <b><i>(\tou baptisth&#275;nai hupo<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. The genitive articular infinitive of purpose, a very<br>
 common idiom. The fame of John had reached Nazareth and the hour<br>
 has come for which Jesus has waited.<br>
 <br>
 3:14 <B>{Would have hindered}</B> <b><i>(\diek&#333;luen\)</i></b>. Rather "tried to<br>
 prevent" as Moffatt has it. It is the conative imperfect. The two<br>
 men of destiny are face to face for the first time apparently.<br>
 The Coming One stands before John and he recognizes him before<br>
 the promised sign is given.<br>
 <br>
 3:15 <B>{To fulfil all righteousness}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;r&#333;sai p&#257;san<br>
 dikaiosun&#275;n\)</i></b>. The explanation of Jesus satisfies John and he<br>
 baptizes the Messiah though he has no sins to confess. It was<br>
 proper <b><i>(\prepon\)</i></b> to do so else the Messiah would seem to hold<br>
 aloof from the Forerunner. Thus the ministries of the two are<br>
 linked together.<br>
 <br>
 3:16 <B>{The Spirit of God descending as a dove}</B> <b><i>(\pneuma theou<br>
 katabainon h&#333;sei peristeran\)</i></b>. It is not certain whether Matthew<br>
 means that the Spirit of God took the form of a dove or came upon<br>
 Jesus as a dove comes down. Either makes sense, but Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 3:22)</i></b> has it "in bodily form as a dove" and that is probably the<br>
 idea here. The dove in Christian art has been considered the<br>
 symbol of the Holy Spirit.<br>
 <br>
 3:17 <B>{A voice out of the heavens}</B> <b><i>(\ph&#333;n&#275; ek t&#333;n ouran&#333;n\)</i></b>. This<br>
 was the voice of the Father to the Son whom he identifies as His<br>
 Son, "my beloved Son." Thus each person of the Trinity is<br>
 represented <b><i>(Father, Son, Holy Spirit)</i></b> at this formal entrance of<br>
 Jesus upon his Messianic ministry. John heard the voice, of<br>
 course, and saw the dove. It was a momentous occasion for John<br>
 and for Jesus and for the whole world. The words are similar to<br>
 <!-#-->Ps 2:7 and the voice at the Transfiguration <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 17:5)</i></b>. The<br>
 good pleasure of the Father is expressed by the timeless aorist<br>
 <b><i>(\eudok&#275;sa\)</i></b>.<br>
