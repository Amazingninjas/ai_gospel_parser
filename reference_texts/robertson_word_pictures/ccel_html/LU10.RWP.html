 <HR>
<p>10:1 <B>{Appointed}</B> <b><i>(\anedeixen\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of<br>
 \anadeiknumi\, an old verb, not only common, but in LXX. In the<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ac 1:24. Cf. \anadeixis\ in <!-#-->Lu 1:80. To<br>
 show forth, display, proclaim, appoint. <B>{Seventy others}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\heterous hebdom&#275;konta kai\)</i></b>. The "also" <b><i>(\kai\)</i></b> and the<br>
 "others" point back to the mission of the Twelve in Galilee<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->9:1-6)</i></b>. Some critics think that Luke has confused this report<br>
 of a mission in Judea with that in Galilee, but needlessly so.<br>
 What earthly objection can there be to two similar missions? B D<br>
 Syr. Cur. and Syr. Sin. have "seventy-two." The seventy elders<br>
 were counted both ways and the Sanhedrin likewise and the nations<br>
 of the earth. It is an evenly balanced point. <B>{Two and two}</B> <b><i>(\ana<br>
 duo\)</i></b>. For companionship as with the Twelve though <!-#-->Mr 6:7 has<br>
 it \duo\ <b><i>(vernacular idiom)</i></b>. B K have here \ana duo\, a<br>
 combination of the idiom in <!-#-->Mr 6:7 and that here. <B>{He himself<br>
 was about to come}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;mellen autos erchesthai\)</i></b>. Imperfect of<br>
 \mell&#333;\ with present infinitive and note \autos\. Jesus was to<br>
 follow after and investigate the work done. This was only a<br>
 temporary appointment and no names are given, but they could<br>
 cover a deal of territory.<br>
 <br>
 10:2 <B>{Harvest}</B> <b><i>(\therismos\)</i></b>. Late word for the older \theros\,<br>
 summer, harvest. The language in this verse is verbatim what we<br>
 have in <!-#-->Mt 9:37,38 to the Twelve. Why not? The need is the same<br>
 and prayer is the answer in each case. Prayer for preachers is<br>
 Christ's method for increasing the supply.<br>
 <br>
 10:3 <B>{As lambs}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s arnas\)</i></b>. Here again the same language as<br>
 that in <!-#-->Mt 10:16 except that there "sheep" <b><i>(\probata\)</i></b> appears<br>
 instead of "lambs." Pathetic picture of the risks of missionaries<br>
 for Christ. They take their life in their hands.<br>
 <br>
 10:4 <B>{Purse}</B> <b><i>(\ballantion\)</i></b>. Old word for money-bag, sometimes a<br>
 javelin as if from \ball&#333;\. Only in Luke in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->10:4;<br>
 12:33; 22:35ff.)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Lu 9:3; Mr 6:7f.; Mt 10:9f. for the<br>
 other similar items. <B>{Salute no man on the way}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;dena kata t&#275;n<br>
 hodon aspas&#275;sthe\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> middle subjunctive<br>
 with \m&#275;dena\. The peril of such wayside salutations was palaver<br>
 and delay. The King's business required haste. Elisha's servant<br>
 was not to tarry for salutations or salaams <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ki 4:29)</i></b>. These<br>
 oriental greetings were tedious, complicated, and often<br>
 meddlesome if others were present or engaged in a bargain.<br>
 <br>
 10:5 <B>{First say}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;ton legete\)</i></b>. Say first. The adverb<br>
 \pr&#333;ton\ can be construed with "enter" <b><i>(\eiselth&#275;te\)</i></b>, but<br>
 probably with \legete\ is right. The word spoken is the usual<br>
 oriental salutation.<br>
 <br>
 10:6 <B>{A son of peace}</B> <b><i>(\huios eir&#275;n&#275;s\)</i></b>. A Hebraism, though some<br>
 examples occur in the vernacular _Koin&#275;_ papyri. It means one<br>
 inclined to peace, describing the head of the household. <B>{Shall<br>
 rest}</B> <b><i>(\epanapa&#275;setai\)</i></b>. Second future passive of \epanapau&#333;\, a<br>
 late double compound <b><i>(\epi, ana\)</i></b> of the common verb \pau&#333;\. <B>{It<br>
 shall turn to you again}</B> <b><i>(\eph' hum&#257;s anakampsei\)</i></b>. Common verb<br>
 \anakampt&#333;\, to bend back, return. The peace in that case will<br>
 bend back with blessing upon the one who spoke it.<br>
 <br>
 10:7 <B>{In that same house}</B> <b><i>(\en aut&#275;i t&#275;i oiki&#257;i\)</i></b>. Literally, in<br>
 the house itself, not "in the same house" <b><i>(\en t&#275;i aut&#275;i<br>
 oiki&#257;i\)</i></b>, a different construction. A free rendering of the<br>
 common Lukan idiom is, "in that very house." <B>{Eating}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\esthontes\)</i></b>. An old poetic verb \esth&#333;\ for \esthi&#333;\ that<br>
 survives in late Greek. <B>{Such things as they give}</B> <b><i>(\ta par'<br>
 aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. "The things from them." <B>{For the labourer is worthy of<br>
 his hire}</B> <b><i>(\axios gar ho ergat&#275;s tou misthou autou\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Mt<br>
 10:10 we have \t&#275;s troph&#275;s autou\ <b><i>(his food)</i></b>. <!-#-->1Ti 5:18 has<br>
 this saying quoted as scripture. That is not impossible if Luke<br>
 wrote by A.D. 62. Paul there however may quote only <!-#-->De 25:4 as<br>
 scripture and get this quotation either from <!-#-->Lu 10:7 or from a<br>
 proverbial saying of Jesus. It is certainly not a real objection<br>
 against the Pauline authorship of First Timothy. <B>{Go not from<br>
 house to house}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; metabainete ex oikias eis oikian\)</i></b>. As a<br>
 habit, \m&#275;\ and the present imperative, and so avoid waste of<br>
 time with such rounds of invitations as would come.<br>
 <br>
 10:8 <B>{Such things as are set before you}</B> <b><i>(\ta paratithemena<br>
 humin\)</i></b>. The things placed before you from time to time <b><i>(present<br>
 passive participle, repetition)</i></b>. Every preacher needs this lesson<br>
 of common politeness. These directions may seem perfunctory and<br>
 even commonplace, but every teacher of young preachers knows how<br>
 necessary they are. Hence they were given both to the Twelve and<br>
 to the Seventy.<br>
 <br>
 10:9 <B>{Is come nigh unto you}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;ggiken eph' hum&#257;s\)</i></b>. Perfect<br>
 active indicative of \eggiz&#333;\ as in <!-#-->Mt 3:2 of the Baptist and<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 1:15 of Jesus. Note \eph' hum&#257;s\ here.<br>
 <br>
 10:10 <B>{Into the streets thereof}</B> <b><i>(\eis tas plateias aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Out<br>
 of the inhospitable houses into the broad open streets.<br>
 <br>
 10:11 <B>{Even the dust}</B> <b><i>(\kai ton koniorton\)</i></b>. Old word from<br>
 \konis\, dust, and \ornumi\, to stir up. We have seen it already<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 10:14; Lu 9:5. Dust is a plague in the east. Shake off<br>
 even that. <B>{Cleaveth}</B> <b><i>(\koll&#275;thenta\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 participle of \kolla&#333;\, to cling as dust and mud do to shoes.<br>
 Hence the orientals took off the sandals on entering a house. <B>{We<br>
 wipe off}</B> <b><i>(\apomassometha\)</i></b>. Middle voice of an old verb<br>
 \apomass&#333;\, to rub off with the hands. Nowhere else in the N.T.<br>
 But \ekmass&#333;\, occurs in <!-#-->Lu 7:38,44. <B>{Against you}</B> <b><i>(\Humin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Fine example of the dative of disadvantage <b><i>(the case of personal<br>
 interest, the dative)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:12 <B>{More tolerable}</B> <b><i>(\anektoteron\)</i></b>. Comparative of the verbal<br>
 adjective \anektos\ from \anechomai\. An old adjective, but only<br>
 the comparative in the N.T. and in this phrase <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:15;<br>
 11:22,24; Lu 10:12,14)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:13 <B>{Would have repented}</B> <b><i>(\an meteno&#275;san\)</i></b>. Conclusion<br>
 <b><i>(apodosis)</i></b> of second-class condition, determined as unfulfilled.<br>
 <B>{Long ago}</B> <b><i>(\palai\)</i></b>. Implies a considerable ministry in these<br>
 cities of which we are not told. Chorazin not mentioned save here<br>
 and <!-#-->Mt 11:21. Perhaps \Kar&#257;zeh\ near Tell Hum <b><i>(Capernaum)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Sitting in sackcloth and ashes}</B> <b><i>(\en sakk&#333;i kai spodoi<br>
 kath&#275;menoi\)</i></b>. Pictorial and graphic. The \sakkos\ <b><i>(sackcloth)</i></b> was<br>
 dark coarse cloth made of goat's hair and worn by penitents,<br>
 mourners, suppliants. It is a Hebrew word, _sag_. The rough cloth<br>
 was used for sacks or bags. To cover oneself with ashes was a<br>
 mode of punishment as well as of voluntary humiliation.<br>
 <br>
 10:15 <B>{Shalt thou be exalted?}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; hups&#333;th&#275;s&#275;i;\)</i></b>. \M&#275;\ expects<br>
 the answer No. The verb is future passive indicative second<br>
 singular of \hupso&#333;\, to lift up, a late verb from \hupsos\,<br>
 height. It is used by Jesus of the Cross <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 12:32)</i></b>. <B>{Unto<br>
 Hades}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s Haidou\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 16:18 for this word which is<br>
 here in contrast to Heaven as in <!-#-->Isa 14:13-15. Hades is not<br>
 Gehenna. "The desolation of the whole neighbourhood, and the<br>
 difficulty of identifying even the site of these flourishing<br>
 towns, is part of the fulfilment of this prophecy" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 Ragg notes the omission of Nazareth from this list of cities of<br>
 neglected privilege and opportunity. "Is it the tender memories<br>
 of boyhood that keep from His lips the name of the arch-rejector<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->4:28 sqq.)</i></b> Nazareth?"<br>
 <br>
 10:16 <B>{Rejecteth him that sent me}</B> <b><i>(\athetei ton aposteilanta<br>
 me\)</i></b>. These solemn words form a fit close for this discourse to<br>
 the Seventy. The fate of Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum will<br>
 befall those who set aside <b><i>(\a\ privative and \thete&#333;\, from<br>
 \tith&#275;mi\)</i></b> the mission and message of these messengers of Christ.<br>
 See this verb used in <!-#-->7:30 of the attitude of the scribes and<br>
 Pharisees toward John and Jesus. It is this thought that makes it<br>
 so grave a responsibility to be co-workers with Christ, high<br>
 privilege as it is <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 9:4)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:17 <B>{Returned with joy}</B> <b><i>(\hupestrepsan meta charas\)</i></b>. They had<br>
 profited by the directions of Jesus. Joy overflows their faces<br>
 and their words. <B>{Even the demons}</B> <b><i>(\kai ta daimonia\)</i></b>. This was<br>
 a real test. The Twelve had been expressly endowed with this<br>
 power when they were sent out <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:1)</i></b>, but the Seventy were<br>
 only told to heal the sick <b><i>(<!-#-->10:9)</i></b>. It was better than they<br>
 expected. The Gospel worked wonders and they were happy. The<br>
 demons were merely one sign of the conflict between Christ and<br>
 Satan. Every preacher has to grapple with demons in his work.<br>
 <B>{Are subject}</B> <b><i>(\hupotassetai\)</i></b>. Present passive indicative<br>
 <b><i>(repetition)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:18 <B>{I beheld Satan fallen}</B> <b><i>(\ethe&#333;roun ton Satan&#257;n pesonta\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active <b><i>(I was beholding)</i></b> and second aorist <b><i>(constative)</i></b><br>
 active participle of \pipt&#333;\ <b><i>(not <B>{fallen}</B>, \pept&#333;kota\, perfect<br>
 active participle, nor <B>{falling}</B>, \piptonta\, present active<br>
 participle, but <B>{fall}</B>, \pesonta\)</i></b>. As a flash of lightning out<br>
 of heaven, quick and startling, so the victory of the Seventy<br>
 over the demons, the agents of Satan, forecast his downfall and<br>
 Jesus in vision pictured it as a flash of lightning.<br>
 <br>
 10:19 <B>{And over all the power of the enemy}</B> <b><i>(\kai epi p&#257;san t&#275;n<br>
 dunamin tou echthrou\)</i></b>. This is the heart of "the authority"<br>
 <b><i>(\t&#275;n exousian\)</i></b> here given by Jesus which is far beyond their<br>
 expectations. The victory over demons was one phase of it. The<br>
 power to tread upon serpents is repeated in <!-#-->Mr 16:18 <b><i>(the<br>
 Appendix)</i></b> and exemplified in Paul's case in Malta <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 28:3-5)</i></b>.<br>
 But protection from physical harm is not the main point in this<br>
 struggle with Satan "the enemy" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 13:25; Ro 16:20; 1Pe 5:8)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Nothing shall in any wise hurt you}</B> <b><i>(\ouden hum&#257;s ou m&#275;<br>
 adik&#275;sei\)</i></b>. Text has future active indicative, while some MSS.<br>
 read \adik&#275;s&#275;i\, aorist active subjunctive of \adike&#333;\, common<br>
 verb from \adikos\ <b><i>(\a\ privative and \dikos\)</i></b>, to suffer wrong,<br>
 to do wrong. The triple negative here is very strong. Certainly<br>
 Jesus does not mean this promise to create presumption or<br>
 foolhardiness for he repelled the enemy's suggestion on the<br>
 pinnacle of the temple.<br>
 <br>
 10:20 <B>{Are written}</B> <b><i>(\engegraptai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative,<br>
 state of completion, stand written, enrolled or engraved, from<br>
 \engraph&#333;\, common verb. "As citizens possessing the full<br>
 privileges of the commonwealth" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:21 <B>{In that same hour}</B> <b><i>(\en aut&#275;i t&#275;i h&#333;r&#257;i\)</i></b>. Literally, "at<br>
 the hour itself," almost a demonstrative use of \autos\<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 686)</i></b> and in Luke alone in the N.T.<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2:38; 10:21; 12:12; 20:19)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mt 11:25 uses the demonstrative<br>
 here, "at that time" <b><i>(\en ekein&#333;i t&#333;i kair&#333;i\)</i></b>. <B>{Rejoiced in the<br>
 Holy Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;galliasato t&#333;i pneumati t&#333;i hagi&#333;i\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist middle of the late verb \agallia&#333;\ for \agall&#333;\, to exult.<br>
 Always in the middle in the N.T. save <!-#-->Lu 1:47 in Mary's<br>
 _Magnificat_. This holy joy of Jesus was directly due to the Holy<br>
 Spirit. It is joy in the work of his followers, their victories<br>
 over Satan, and is akin to the joy felt by Jesus in <!-#-->Joh 4:32-38<br>
 when the vision of the harvest of the world stirred his heart.<br>
 The rest of this verse is precisely like <!-#-->Mt 11:25f., a<br>
 peculiarly Johannine passage in Matthew and Luke, but not in<br>
 Mark, and so from Q <b><i>(the Logia of Jesus)</i></b>. It has disturbed<br>
 critics who are unwilling to admit the Johannine style and type<br>
 of teaching as genuine, but here it is. See on Matthew for<br>
 discussion. "That God had proved his independence of the human<br>
 intellect is a matter for thankfulness. Intellectual gifts, so<br>
 far from being necessary, are often a hindrance" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 10:22 <B>{Knoweth who the Son is}</B> <b><i>(\gin&#333;skei tis estin ho huios\)</i></b>.<br>
 Knows by experience, \gin&#333;skei\. Here <!-#-->Mt 11:27 has<br>
 \epigin&#333;skei\ <b><i>(fully knows)</i></b> and simply \ton huion\ <b><i>(the Son)</i></b><br>
 instead of the "who" <b><i>(\tis\)</i></b> clause. So also in "who the Father<br>
 is" <b><i>(\tis estin ho pater\)</i></b>. But the same use and contrast of "the<br>
 Father," "the Son." in both Matthew and Luke, "an aerolite from<br>
 the Johannean heaven" <b><i>(Hase)</i></b>. No sane criticism can get rid of<br>
 this Johannine bit in these Gospels written long before the<br>
 Fourth Gospel was composed. We are dealing here with the oldest<br>
 known document about Christ <b><i>(the Logia)</i></b> and the picture is that<br>
 drawn in the Fourth Gospel <b><i>(see my _The Christ of the Logia_)</i></b>. It<br>
 is idle to try to whittle away by fantastic exegesis the high<br>
 claims made by Jesus in this passage. It is an ecstatic prayer in<br>
 the presence of the Seventy under the rapture of the Holy Spirit<br>
 on terms of perfect equality and understanding between the Father<br>
 and the Son in the tone of the priestly prayer in <!-#-->Joh 17. We<br>
 are justified in saying that this prayer of supreme Fellowship<br>
 with the Father in contemplation of final victory over Satan<br>
 gives us a glimpse of the prayers with the Father when the Son<br>
 spent whole nights on the mountain alone with the Father. Here is<br>
 the Messianic consciousness in complete control and with perfect<br>
 confidence in the outcome. Here as in <!-#-->Mt 11:27 by the use of<br>
 <B>{willeth to reveal him}</B> <b><i>(\boul&#275;tai apokalupsai\)</i></b>. The Son claims<br>
 the power to reveal the Father "to whomsoever he wills" <b><i>(\h&#333;i an<br>
 boul&#275;tai\, indefinite relative and present subjunctive of<br>
 \boulomai\, to will, not the future indicative)</i></b>. This is divine<br>
 sovereignty most assuredly. Human free agency is also true, but<br>
 it is full divine sovereignty in salvation that is here claimed<br>
 along with possession <b><i>(\paredoth&#275;\, timeless aorist passive<br>
 indicative)</i></b> of all power from the Father. Let that supreme claim<br>
 stand.<br>
 <br>
 10:23 <B>{Turning to the disciples}</B> <b><i>(\strapheis pros tous<br>
 math&#275;tas\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive of \streph&#333;\ as in <!-#-->9:55. The<br>
 prayer was a soliloquy though uttered in the presence of the<br>
 Seventy on their return. Now Jesus turned and spoke "privately"<br>
 or to the disciples <b><i>(the Twelve, apparently)</i></b>, whether on this<br>
 same occasion or a bit later. <B>{Blessed}</B> <b><i>(\makarioi\)</i></b>. A<br>
 beatitude, the same adjective as in <!-#-->Mt 5:3-11. A beatitude of<br>
 privilege very much like that in <!-#-->Mt 5:13-16. Jesus often<br>
 repeated his sayings.<br>
 <br>
 10:24 <B>{Which ye see}</B> <b><i>(\ha humeis blepete\)</i></b>. The expression of<br>
 \humeis\ makes "ye" very emphatic in contrast with the prophets<br>
 and kings of former days.<br>
 <br>
 10:25 <B>{And tempted him}</B> <b><i>(\ekpeiraz&#333;n auton\)</i></b>. Present active<br>
 participle, conative idea, trying to tempt him. There is no "and"<br>
 in the Greek. He "stood up <b><i>(\anest&#275;\, ingressive second aorist<br>
 active)</i></b> trying to tempt him." \Peiraz&#333;\ is a late form of<br>
 \peira&#333;\ and \ekpeiraz&#333;\ apparently only in the LXX, and N.T.<br>
 <b><i>(quoted by Jesus from <!-#-->De 6:16 in <!-#-->Mt 4:7; Lu 4:12 against<br>
 Satan)</i></b>. Here and <!-#-->1Co 10:9. The spirit of this lawyer was evil.<br>
 He wanted to entrap Jesus if possible. <B>{What shall I do to<br>
 inherit eternal life?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti poi&#275;sas z&#333;&#275;n ai&#333;niou kl&#275;ronom&#275;s&#333;;\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "By doing what shall I inherit eternal life?" Note the<br>
 emphasis on "doing" <b><i>(\poi&#275;sas\)</i></b>. The form of his question shows a<br>
 wrong idea as to how to get it. <B>{Eternal life}</B> <b><i>(\z&#333;&#275;n ai&#333;nion\)</i></b><br>
 is endless life as in John's Gospel <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 16:9; 18:18,30)</i></b> and in<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 25:46, which see.<br>
 <br>
 10:26 <B>{How readest thou?}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;s anagin&#333;skeis;\)</i></b>. As a lawyer it<br>
 was his business to know the facts in the law and the proper<br>
 interpretation of the law. See on &#175;Lu 7:30 about \nomikos\<br>
 <b><i>(lawyer)</i></b>. The rabbis had a formula, "What readest thou?"<br>
 <br>
 10:27 <B>{And he answering}</B> <b><i>(\ho de apokritheis\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 participle, no longer passive in idea. The lawyer's answer is<br>
 first from the _Shema_ <b><i>(<!-#-->De 6:3; 11:13)</i></b> which was written on the<br>
 phylacteries. The second part is from <!-#-->Le 19:18 and shows that<br>
 the lawyer knew the law. At a later time Jesus himself in the<br>
 temple gives a like summary of the law to a lawyer <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 12:28-34;<br>
 Mt 22:34-40)</i></b> who wanted to catch Jesus by his question. There is<br>
 no difficulty in the two incidents. God is to be loved with all<br>
 of man's four powers <b><i>(heart, soul, strength, mind)</i></b> here as in <!-#-->Mr<br>
 12:30.<br>
 <br>
 10:28 <B>{Thou hast answered right}</B> <b><i>(\orth&#333;s apekrith&#275;s\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist passive indicative second singular with the adverb<br>
 \orth&#333;s\. The answer was correct so far as the words went. In <!-#-->Mr<br>
 12:34 Jesus commends the scribe for agreeing to his<br>
 interpretation of the first and the second commandments. That<br>
 scribe was "not far from the kingdom of God," but this lawyer was<br>
 "tempting" Jesus. <B>{Do this and thou shalt live}</B> <b><i>(\touto poiei kai<br>
 z&#275;s&#275;i\)</i></b>. Present imperative <b><i>(keep on doing this forever)</i></b> and the<br>
 future indicative middle as a natural result. There was only one<br>
 trouble with the lawyer's answer. No one ever did or ever can<br>
 "do" what the law lays down towards God and man always. To slip<br>
 once is to fail. So Jesus put the problem squarely up to the<br>
 lawyer who wanted to know <B>{by doing what}</B>. Of course, if he kept<br>
 the law <B>{perfectly always}</B>, he would inherit eternal life.<br>
 <br>
 10:29 <B>{Desiring to justify himself}</B> <b><i>(\thel&#333;n dikai&#333;sai heauton\)</i></b>.<br>
 The lawyer saw at once that he had convicted himself of asking a<br>
 question that he already knew. In his embarrassment he asks<br>
 another question to show that he did have some point at first:<br>
 <B>{And who is my neighbour?}</B> <b><i>(\kai tis estin mou pl&#275;sion;\)</i></b>. The<br>
 Jews split hairs over this question and excluded from "neighbour"<br>
 Gentiles and especially Samaritans. So here was his loop-hole. A<br>
 neighbour is a nigh dweller to one, but the Jews made racial<br>
 exceptions as many, alas, do today. The word \pl&#275;sion\ here is an<br>
 adverb <b><i>(neuter of the adjective \pl&#275;sios\)</i></b> meaning \ho pl&#275;sion<br>
 &#333;n\ <b><i>(the one who is near)</i></b>, but \&#333;n\ was usually not expressed and<br>
 the adverb is here used as if a substantive.<br>
 <br>
 10:30 <B>{Made answer}</B> <b><i>(\hupolab&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \hupolamban&#333;\ <b><i>(see <!-#-->7:43)</i></b>, to take up literally,<br>
 and then in thought and speech, old verb, but in this sense of<br>
 interrupting in talk only in the N.T. <B>{Was going down}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katebainen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active describing the journey. <B>{Fell<br>
 among robbers}</B> <b><i>(\l&#275;istais periepesen\)</i></b>. Second aorist ingressive<br>
 active indicative of \peripipt&#333;\, old verb with associative<br>
 instrumental case, to fall among and to be encompassed by<br>
 <b><i>(\peri\, around)</i></b>, to be surrounded by robbers. A common<br>
 experience to this day on the road to Jericho. The Romans placed<br>
 a fort on this "red and bloody way." These were bandits, not<br>
 petty thieves. <B>{Stripped}</B> <b><i>(\ekdusantes\)</i></b>. Of his clothing as well<br>
 as of his money, the meanest sort of robbers. <B>{Beat him}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;gas<br>
 epithentes\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of \epitith&#275;mi\, a<br>
 common verb. Literally, "placing strokes or blows" <b><i>(\pl&#275;gas\,<br>
 plagues)</i></b> upon him. See <!-#-->Lu 12:48; Ac 16:23; Re 15:1,6,8 for<br>
 "plagues." <B>{Half-dead}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;mithan&#275;\)</i></b>. Late word from \h&#275;mi\,<br>
 half, and \thn&#275;sk&#333;\, to die. Only here in the N.T. Vivid picture<br>
 of the robbery.<br>
 <br>
 10:31 <B>{By chance}</B> <b><i>(\kata sugkurian\)</i></b>. Here only in the N.T.,<br>
 meaning rather, "by way of coincidence." It is a rare word<br>
 elsewhere and in late writers like Hippocrates. It is from the<br>
 verb \sugkure&#333;\, though \sugkur&#275;sis\ is more common. <B>{Was going<br>
 down}</B> <b><i>(\katebainen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active as in verse <!-#-->30. Passed<br>
 by on the other side <b><i>(\antipar&#275;lthen\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative of \antiparerchomai\, a late double compound here<br>
 <b><i>(verses <!-#-->31,32)</i></b> only in the N.T., but in the papyri and late<br>
 writers. It is the ingressive aorist <b><i>(\&#275;lthen\)</i></b>, came alongside<br>
 <b><i>(\para\)</i></b>, and then he stepped over to the opposite side <b><i>(\anti\)</i></b><br>
 of the road to avoid ceremonial contamination with a stranger. A<br>
 vivid and powerful picture of the vice of Jewish ceremonial<br>
 cleanliness at the cost of moral principle and duty. The Levite<br>
 in verse <!-#-->32 behaved precisely as the priest had done and for<br>
 the same reason.<br>
 <br>
 10:33 <B>{A certain Samaritan}</B> <b><i>(\Samareit&#275;s de tis\)</i></b>. Of all men in<br>
 the world to do a neighbourly act! <B>{As he journeyed}</B> <b><i>(\hodeu&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Making his way. <B>{Came where he was}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;lthen kat' auton\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "came down upon him." He did not sidestep or dodge<br>
 him, but had compassion on him.<br>
 <br>
 10:34 <B>{Bound up his wounds}</B> <b><i>(\kated&#275;sen ta traumata\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active indicative of \katade&#333;\, old verb, but here only in<br>
 the N.T. The verb means "bound down." We say "bind up." Medical<br>
 detail that interested Luke. The word for "wounds" <b><i>(\traumata\)</i></b><br>
 here only in the N.T. <B>{Pouring on them oil and wine}</B> <b><i>(\epiche&#333;n<br>
 elaion kai oinon\)</i></b>. Old verb again, but here only in the N.T. Oil<br>
 and wine were household remedies even for wounds <b><i>(soothing oil,<br>
 antiseptic alcohol)</i></b>. Hippocrates prescribed for ulcers: "Bind<br>
 with soft wool, and sprinkle with wine and oil." <B>{Set him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epibibasas\)</i></b>. An old verb \epibibaz&#333;\ <b><i>(\epi\, \bibaz&#333;\)</i></b>, to<br>
 cause to mount. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ac 19:35; 23:24,<br>
 common in LXX. <B>{Beast}</B> <b><i>(\kt&#275;nos\)</i></b>. Old word from \ktaomai\, to<br>
 acquire, and so property <b><i>(\kt&#275;ma\)</i></b> especially cattle or any beast<br>
 of burden. <B>{An inn}</B> <b><i>(\pandocheion\)</i></b>. The old Attic form was<br>
 \pandokeion\ <b><i>(from \pan\, all, and \dechomai\, to receive)</i></b>. A<br>
 public place for receiving all comers and a more pretentious<br>
 caravanserai than a \kataluma\ like that in <!-#-->Lu 2:7. Here only<br>
 in the N.T. There are ruins of two inns about halfway between<br>
 Bethany and Jericho.<br>
 <br>
 10:35 <B>{On the morrow}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;n aurion\)</i></b>. Towards the morrow as<br>
 in <!-#-->Ac 4:5. <b><i>(Cf. also <!-#-->Ac 3:1)</i></b>. Syriac Sinaitic has it "at dawn<br>
 of the day." An unusual use of \epi\. <B>{Took out}</B> <b><i>(\ekbal&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist active participle of \ekball&#333;\. It could mean,<br>
 "fling out," but probably only means "drew out." Common verb.<br>
 <B>{Two pence}</B> <b><i>(\duo d&#275;naria\)</i></b>. About thirty-five cents, but worth<br>
 more in purchasing power. <B>{To the host}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i pandochei\)</i></b>. The<br>
 innkeeper. Here only in the N.T. <B>{Whatsoever thou spendest more}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hoti an prosdapan&#275;s&#275;is\)</i></b>. Indefinite relative clause with \an\<br>
 and the aorist active subjunctive of \prosdapana&#333;\, to spend<br>
 besides <b><i>(\pros\)</i></b>, a late verb for the common \prosanalisk&#333;\ and<br>
 here only in the N.T. <B>{I will repay}</B> <b><i>(\ego apod&#333;s&#333;\)</i></b>. Emphatic.<br>
 What he had paid was merely by way of pledge. He was a man of his<br>
 word and known to the innkeeper as reliable. <B>{When I come back<br>
 again}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i epanerchesthai me\)</i></b>. Luke's favourite idiom of<br>
 \en\ and the articular infinitive with accusative of general<br>
 reference. Double compound verb \epanerchomai\.<br>
 <br>
 10:36 <B>{Proved neighbour to him that fell}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;sion gegonenai tou<br>
 empesontos\)</i></b>. Second perfect infinitive of \ginomai\ and second<br>
 aorist active participle of \empipt&#333;\. Objective genitive, became<br>
 neighbour to the one, etc. Jesus has changed the lawyer's<br>
 standpoint and has put it up to him to decide which of "these<br>
 three" <b><i>(\tout&#333;n t&#333;n tri&#333;n\, priest, Levite, Samaritan)</i></b> acted like<br>
 a neighbour to the wounded man.<br>
 <br>
 10:37 <B>{On him}</B> <b><i>(\met' autou\)</i></b>. With him, more exactly. The lawyer<br>
 saw the point and gave the correct answer, but he gulped at the<br>
 word "Samaritan" and refused to say that. <B>{Do thou}</B> <b><i>(\su poiei\)</i></b>.<br>
 Emphasis on "thou." Would this Jewish lawyer act the neighbour to<br>
 a Samaritan? This parable of the Good Samaritan has built the<br>
 world's hospitals and, if understood and practised, will remove<br>
 race prejudice, national hatred and war, class jealousy.<br>
 <br>
 10:38 <B>{Now as they went on their way}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n de t&#333;i poreuesthai<br>
 autous\)</i></b>. Luke's favourite temporal clause again as in verse<br>
 <!-#-->35. <B>{Received him into her house}</B> <b><i>(\hupedexato auton eis t&#275;n<br>
 oikian\)</i></b>. Aorist middle indicative of \hupodechomai\, an old verb<br>
 to welcome as a guest <b><i>(in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 19:6; Ac<br>
 17:7; Jas 2:25)</i></b>. Martha is clearly the mistress of the home and<br>
 is probably the elder sister. There is no evidence that she was<br>
 the wife of Simon the leper <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 12:1f.)</i></b>. It is curious that in<br>
 an old cemetery at Bethany the names of Martha, Eleazar, and<br>
 Simon have been found.<br>
 <br>
 10:39 <B>{Which also sat}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; kai parakathestheisa\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive participle of \parakathezomai\, an old verb, but only<br>
 here in the N.T. It means to sit beside <b><i>(\para\)</i></b> and \pros\ means<br>
 right in front of the feet of Jesus. It is not clear what the<br>
 point is in \kai\ here. It may mean that Martha loved to sit here<br>
 also as well as Mary. <B>{Heard}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;kouen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. She<br>
 took her seat by the feet of Jesus and went on listening to his<br>
 talk.<br>
 <br>
 10:40 <B>{Was cumbered}</B> <b><i>(\periesp&#257;to\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive of<br>
 \perispa&#333;\, an old verb with vivid metaphor, to draw around. One<br>
 has sometimes seen women whose faces are literally drawn round<br>
 with anxiety, with a permanent twist, distracted in mind and in<br>
 looks. <B>{She came up to him}</B> <b><i>(\epist&#257;sa\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \ephist&#275;mi\, an old verb to place upon, but in the<br>
 N.T. only in the middle voice or the intransitive tenses of the<br>
 active <b><i>(perfect and second aorist as here)</i></b>. It is the ingressive<br>
 aorist here and really means. stepping up to or bursting in or<br>
 upon Jesus. It is an explosive act as is the speech of Martha.<br>
 <B>{Dost thou not care}</B> <b><i>(\ou melei soi\)</i></b>. This was a reproach to<br>
 Jesus for monopolizing Mary to Martha's hurt. <B>{Did leave me}</B> <b><i>(\me<br>
 kateleipen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, she kept on leaving me. <B>{Bid her}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eipon aut&#275;i\)</i></b>. Late form instead of \eipe\, second aorist<br>
 active imperative, common in the papyri. Martha feels that Jesus<br>
 is the key to Mary's help. <B>{That she help me}</B> <b><i>(\hina moi<br>
 sunantilab&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Sub-final use of \hina\ with second aorist<br>
 middle subjunctive of \sunantilambanomai\, a double compound verb<br>
 <b><i>(\sun\, with, \anti\, at her end of the line, and \lambanomai\,<br>
 middle voice of \lamban&#333;\, to take hold)</i></b>, a late compound<br>
 appearing in the LXX, Diodorus and Josephus. Deissmann <b><i>(_Light<br>
 from the Ancient East_, p. 87)</i></b> finds it in many widely scattered<br>
 inscriptions "throughout the whole extent of the Hellenistic<br>
 world of the Mediterranean." It appears only twice in the N.T.<br>
 <b><i>(here and <!-#-->Ro 8:26)</i></b>. It is a beautiful word, to take hold<br>
 oneself <b><i>(middle voice)</i></b> at his end of the task <b><i>(\anti\)</i></b> together<br>
 with <b><i>(\sun\)</i></b> one.<br>
 <br>
 10:41 <B>{Art anxious}</B> <b><i>(\merimn&#257;is\)</i></b>. An old verb for worry and<br>
 anxiety from \meriz&#333;\ <b><i>(\meris\, part)</i></b> to be divided, distracted.<br>
 Jesus had warned against this in the Sermon on the Mount <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 6:25,28,31,34. See also <!-#-->Lu 12:11,22,26)</i></b>. <B>{And troubled}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 thorubaz&#275;i\)</i></b>. From \thorubazomai\, a verb found nowhere else so<br>
 far. Many MSS. here have the usual form \turbaz&#275;i\, from<br>
 \turbaz&#333;\. Apparently from \thorubos\, a common enough word for<br>
 tumult. Martha had both inward anxiety and outward agitation.<br>
 <B>{But one thing is needful}</B> <b><i>(\henos de estin chreia\)</i></b>. This is the<br>
 reading of A C and may be correct. A few manuscripts have: "There<br>
 is need of few things." Aleph B L <b><i>(and Westcott and Hort)</i></b> have:<br>
 "There is need of few things or one," which seems like a conflate<br>
 reading though the readings are all old. See Robertson,<br>
 _Introduction to Textual Criticism of the N.T._, p. 190. Jesus<br>
 seems to say to Martha that only one dish was really necessary<br>
 for the meal instead of the "many" about which she was so<br>
 anxious.<br>
 <br>
 10:42 <B>{The good portion}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n agath&#275;n merida\)</i></b>. The best dish on<br>
 the table, fellowship with Jesus. This is the spiritual<br>
 application of the metaphor of the dishes on the table. Salvation<br>
 is not "the good portion" for Martha had that also. <B>{From her}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Ablative case after \aphair&#275;th&#275;setai\ <b><i>(future passive<br>
 indicative)</i></b>. Jesus pointedly takes Mary's side against Martha's<br>
 fussiness.<br>
