<p>6:1 <B>{When the number of the disciples was multiplying}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pl&#275;thunont&#333;n t&#333;n math&#275;t&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute of \pl&#275;thun&#333;\,<br>
 old verb from \pl&#275;thos\, fulness, to increase. The new freedom<br>
 from the intercession of Gamaliel was bearing rich fruit. <B>{A<br>
 murmuring of the Grecian Jews}</B> <b><i>(\goggusmos t&#333;n Hell&#275;nist&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Late onomatopoetic word <b><i>(LXX)</i></b> from the late verb \gogguz&#333;\, to<br>
 mutter, to murmur. The substantive occurs also in <!-#-->Joh 7:12; Php<br>
 2:14; 1Pe 4:9. It is the secret grumblings that buzz away till<br>
 they are heard. These "Grecian Jews" or Hellenists are members of<br>
 the church in Jerusalem who are Jews from outside of Palestine<br>
 like Barnabas from Cyprus. These Hellenists had points of contact<br>
 with the Gentile world without having gone over to the habits of<br>
 the Gentiles, the Jews of the Western Dispersion. They spoke<br>
 Greek. <B>{Against the Hebrews}</B> <b><i>(\pros tous Ebraious\)</i></b>. The Jewish<br>
 Christians from Jerusalem and Palestine. The Aramaean Jews of the<br>
 Eastern Dispersion are usually classed with the Hebrew <b><i>(speaking<br>
 Aramaic)</i></b> as distinct from the Grecian Jews or Hellenists. <B>{Were<br>
 neglected}</B> <b><i>(\parethe&#333;rounto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive of<br>
 \parathe&#333;re&#333;\, old verb, to examine things placed beside <b><i>(\para\)</i></b><br>
 each other, to look beyond <b><i>(\para\ also)</i></b>, to overlook, to<br>
 neglect. Here only in the N.T. These widows may receive daily<br>
 <b><i>(\kath&#275;merin&#275;i\, late adjective from \kath' h&#275;meran\, only here<br>
 in the N.T.)</i></b> help from the common fund provided for all who need<br>
 it <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 4:32-37)</i></b>. The temple funds for widows were probably not<br>
 available for those who have now become Christians. Though they<br>
 were all Christians here concerned, yet the same line of cleavage<br>
 existed as among the other Jews <b><i>(Hebrew or Aramaean Jews and<br>
 Hellenists)</i></b>. It is not here said that the murmuring arose among<br>
 the widows, but because of them. Women and money occasion the<br>
 first serious disturbance in the church life. There was evident<br>
 sensitiveness that called for wisdom.<br>
 <br>
 6:2 <B>{The multitude}</B> <b><i>(\to pl&#275;thos\)</i></b>. The whole church, not just<br>
 the 120. <B>{Fit}</B> <b><i>(\areston\)</i></b>. Pleasing, verbal adjective from<br>
 \aresk&#333;\, to please, old word, but in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ac<br>
 12:3; Joh 8:29; 1Jo 3:22. _Non placet_. <B>{Should forsake}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kataleipsantas\)</i></b>. Late first aorist active participle for usual<br>
 second aorist \katalipontas\ from \kataleip&#333;\, to leave behind.<br>
 <B>{Serve tables}</B> <b><i>(\diakonein trapezais\)</i></b>. Present active infinitive<br>
 of \diakone&#333;\ from \diakonos\ <b><i>(\dia\ and \konis\, dust)</i></b>, to raise<br>
 a dust in a hurry, to serve, to minister either at table <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 12:20)</i></b>, or other service <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 12:25f.)</i></b>, to serve as deacon<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 3:10,13)</i></b>. "Tables" here hardly means money-tables as in<br>
 <!-#-->Joh 2:15, but rather the tables used in the common daily<br>
 distribution of the food <b><i>(possibly including the love-feasts, <!-#-->Ac<br>
 2:43-47)</i></b>. This word is the same root as \diakonia\<br>
 <b><i>(ministration)</i></b> in verse <!-#-->1 and \diakonos\ <b><i>(deacon)</i></b> in <!-#-->Php 1:1;<br>
 1Ti 3:8-13. It is more frequently used in the N.T. of ministers<br>
 <b><i>(preachers)</i></b> than of deacons, but it is quite possible, even<br>
 probable, that the office of deacon as separate from bishop or<br>
 elder grew out of this incident in <!-#-->Ac 6:1-7. Furneaux is clear<br>
 that these "seven" are not to be identified with the later<br>
 "deacons" but why he does not make clear.<br>
 <br>
 6:3 <B>{Of good report}</B> <b><i>(\marturoumenous\)</i></b>. Present passive<br>
 participle of \marture&#333;\, to bear witness to. Men with a good<br>
 reputation as well as with spiritual gifts <b><i>(the Holy Spirit and<br>
 wisdom)</i></b>. <B>{We may appoint}</B> <b><i>(\katast&#275;somen\)</i></b>. Future active<br>
 indicative of \kathist&#275;mi\, we shall appoint. The action of the<br>
 apostles follows the choice by the church, but it is promised as<br>
 a certainty, not as a possibility. The Textus Receptus has a<br>
 first aorist active subjunctive here <b><i>(\katast&#275;s&#333;men\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:4 <B>{But we}</B> <b><i>(\hemeis de\)</i></b>. In contrast to the work given the<br>
 seven. <B>{The ministry of the word}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i diakoni&#257;i tou logou\)</i></b>.<br>
 The same word \diakoni&#257;i\ employed in verse <!-#-->1, but here about<br>
 preaching as the special ministry with which the apostles were<br>
 concerned. For "continue steadfastly" <b><i>(\proskarter&#275;somen\)</i></b> see on<br>
 &#175;2:42.<br>
 <br>
 6:5 <B>{Pleased}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;resen\)</i></b>. Aorist active indicative of \aresk&#333;\<br>
 like Latin _placuit_ when a vote was taken. The use of \en&#333;pion\<br>
 before "the whole multitude" is like the LXX. <B>{They chose}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\exelexanto\)</i></b>. First aorist middle indicative of \ekleg&#333;\, to<br>
 pick out for oneself. Each one of the seven has a Greek name and<br>
 was undoubtedly a Hellenist, not an Aramaean Jew. Consummate<br>
 wisdom is here displayed for the murmuring had come from the<br>
 Hellenists, seven of whom were chosen to take proper care of the<br>
 widows of Hellenists. This trouble was settled to stay settled so<br>
 far as we know. Nothing is here told of any of the seven except<br>
 Stephen who is "a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit" and<br>
 Nicolas "a proselyte of Antioch" <b><i>(who was not then born a Jew,<br>
 but had come to the Jews from the Greek world)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:6 <B>{They laid their hands on them}</B> <b><i>(\epeth&#275;kan autois tas<br>
 cheiras\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of \epitith&#275;mi\.<br>
 Probably by the apostles who ratified the choice <b><i>(verse <!-#-->3)</i></b>. The<br>
 laying on of hands "was a symbol of the impartation of the gifts<br>
 and graces which they needed to qualify them for the office. It<br>
 was of the nature of a prayer that God would bestow the necessary<br>
 gifts, rather than a pledge that they were actually conferred"<br>
 <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:7 <B>{Increased}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;uxanen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, kept on growing<br>
 all the more because the apostles were now relieved from the<br>
 daily ministration of the food. <B>{Multiplied}</B> <b><i>(\epl&#275;thuneto\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect passive. The two imperfects kept pace with each other.<br>
 <B>{Of the priests}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n hier&#333;n\)</i></b>. Who were usually Sadducees. It<br>
 was a sad day for Annas and Caiaphas and all the sect of the<br>
 Sadducees <b><i>(<!-#-->5:17)</i></b>. <B>{Were obedient to}</B> <b><i>(\hup&#275;kouon\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active of \hupakou&#333;\, repetition, one after another. <B>{The faith}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\t&#275;i pistei\)</i></b>. Here meaning the gospel, the faith system as in<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 1:5; Ga 1:23; Jude 1:3, etc. Here the word means more than<br>
 individual trust in Christ.<br>
 <br>
 6:8 <B>{Wrought}</B> <b><i>(\epoiei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, repeatedly wrought.<br>
 Evidently a man like Stephen would not confine his "ministry" to<br>
 "serving tables." He was called in verse <!-#-->5 "full of faith and<br>
 the Holy Spirit." Here he is termed "full of grace <b><i>(so the best<br>
 MSS., not faith)</i></b> and power." The four words give a picture of<br>
 remarkable attractiveness. The grace of God gave him the power<br>
 and so "he kept on doing great wonders and signs among the<br>
 people." He was a sudden whirlwind of power in the very realm of<br>
 Peter and John and the rest.<br>
 <br>
 6:9 <B>{The synagogue of the Libertines}</B> <b><i>(\ek t&#275;s sunag&#333;g&#275;s t&#275;s<br>
 legomen&#275;s Libertin&#333;n\)</i></b>. The Libertines <b><i>(Latin _libertinus_, a<br>
 freedman or the son of a freedman)</i></b> were Jews, once slaves of Rome<br>
 <b><i>(perhaps descendants of the Jews taken to Rome as captives by<br>
 Pompey)</i></b>, now set free and settled in Jerusalem and numerous<br>
 enough to have a synagogue of their own. Schuerer calls a<br>
 Talmudic myth the statement that there were 480 synagogues in<br>
 Jerusalem. There were many, no doubt, but how many no one knows.<br>
 These places of worship and study were in all the cities of the<br>
 later times where there were Jews enough to maintain one.<br>
 Apparently Luke here speaks of five such synagogues in Jerusalem<br>
 <b><i>(that of the Libertines, of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians,<br>
 of Cilicia, and of Asia)</i></b>. There probably were enough Hellenists<br>
 in Jerusalem to have five such synagogues. But the language of<br>
 Luke is not clear on this point. He may make only two groups<br>
 instead of five since he uses the article \t&#333;n\ twice <b><i>(once<br>
 before \Libertin&#333;n kai Kur&#275;nai&#333;n kai Alexandre&#333;n\, again before<br>
 \apo Kilikias kai Asias\)</i></b>. He also changes from the genitive<br>
 plural to \apo\ before Cilicia and Asia. But, leaving the number<br>
 of the synagogues unsettled whether five or two, it is certain<br>
 that in each one where Stephen appeared as a Hellenist preaching<br>
 Jesus as the Messiah he met opposition. Certain of them "arose"<br>
 <b><i>(\anest&#275;san\)</i></b> "stood up" after they had stood all that they could<br>
 from Stephen, "disputing with Stephen" <b><i>(\sunz&#275;tountes t&#333;i<br>
 Stephan&#333;i\)</i></b>. Present active participle of \sunz&#275;te&#333;\, to question<br>
 together as the two on the way to Emmaus did <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:15)</i></b>. Such<br>
 interruptions were common with Jews. They give a skilled speaker<br>
 great opportunity for reply if he is quick in repartee. Evidently<br>
 Stephen was fully equipped for the emergency. One of their<br>
 synagogues had men from Cilicia in it, making it practically<br>
 certain that young Saul of Tarsus, the brilliant student of<br>
 Gamaliel, was present and tried his wits with Stephen. His<br>
 ignominious defeat may be one explanation of his zest in the<br>
 stoning of Stephen <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 8:1)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:10 <B>{They were not able to withstand}</B> <b><i>(\ouk ischuon<br>
 antist&#275;nai\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \ischu&#333;\, to have strength, and<br>
 ingressive second aorist active <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b> infinitive of<br>
 \anthist&#275;mi\. They continued unable <b><i>(without strength enough)</i></b> to<br>
 take a stand against. Stephen knocked them down, Saul included,<br>
 as fast as they got up. Stephen was like a battery charged and in<br>
 action. <B>{The wisdom and spirit}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i sophi&#257;i kai pneumati\)</i></b>.<br>
 Dative case. They stood up against Stephen's wisdom and the Holy<br>
 Spirit "by whom he spoke" <b><i>(\h&#333;i elalei\)</i></b>. Instrumental case and<br>
 the relative agrees with "Spirit." He kept on speaking so<br>
 <b><i>(\elalei\, imperfect active)</i></b>. It was a desperate situation.<br>
 <br>
 6:11 <B>{Then they suborned men}</B> <b><i>(\tote hupebalon andras\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active indicative of \hupoball&#333;\, old verb, but here only<br>
 in the N.T., to put under like a carpet, to bring men under one's<br>
 control by suggestion or by money. One recalls the plight of<br>
 Caiaphas in the trial of Jesus when he sought false witnesses.<br>
 _Subornaverunt_. They put these men forward in an underhand way<br>
 for fraud. <B>{Blasphemous words against Moses and God}</B> <b><i>(\blasph&#275;ma<br>
 eis M&#333;us&#275;n kai ton theon\)</i></b>. The punishment for blasphemy was<br>
 stoning to death. See <!-#-->Mt 12:31 for discussion of the word<br>
 \blasph&#275;mia, blasph&#275;me&#333;, blasph&#275;mos\, all in the N.T. from<br>
 \blapt&#333;\, to harm, and \ph&#275;m&#275;\, speech, harmful speech, or<br>
 \blax\, stupid, and \ph&#275;m&#275;\. But the charge against Stephen was<br>
 untrue. Please note that Moses is here placed before God and<br>
 practically on a par with God in the matter of blasphemy. The<br>
 purpose of this charge is to stir the prejudices of the people in<br>
 the matter of Jewish rights and privileges. It is the Pharisees<br>
 who are conducting this attack on Stephen while the Sadducees had<br>
 led them against Peter and John. The position of Stephen is<br>
 critical in the extreme for the Sadducees will not help him as<br>
 Gamaliel did the apostles.<br>
 <br>
 6:12 <B>{They stirred up the people}</B> <b><i>(\sunekin&#275;san ton laon\)</i></b>. They<br>
 shook the people together like an earthquake. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of \sunkine&#333;\, to throw into commotion. Old verb, but<br>
 here only in the N.T. The elders and the scribes <b><i>(Pharisees)</i></b> are<br>
 reached, but no word about the Sadducees. This is the first<br>
 record of the hostility of the masses against the disciples<br>
 <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. <B>{Came upon him}</B> <b><i>(\epistantes\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active participle of \ephist&#275;mi\. Rushed at him.<br>
 <B>{Seized}</B> <b><i>(\sun&#275;rpasan\)</i></b>. Effective aorist active of \sunarpaz&#333;\<br>
 as if they caught him after pursuit.<br>
 <br>
 6:13 <B>{False witnesses}</B> <b><i>(\marturas pseudeis\)</i></b>. Just as Caiaphas<br>
 did with Jesus. <B>{Ceaseth not}</B> <b><i>(\ou pauetai\)</i></b>. Wild charge just<br>
 like a false witness that Stephen talks in the synagogues against<br>
 the law and the holy temple.<br>
 <br>
 6:14 <B>{We have heard him say}</B> <b><i>(\ak&#275;koamen autou legontos\)</i></b>. The<br>
 only direct testimony and evidently wrong. Curiously like the<br>
 charge brought against Jesus before Caiaphas that he would<br>
 destroy the temple and build it again in three days. Undoubtedly<br>
 Stephen had said something about Christianity before as meant for<br>
 others besides Jews. He had caught the spirit of Jesus about<br>
 worship as shown to the woman at Sychar in <!-#-->Joh 4 that God is<br>
 spirit and to be worshipped by men anywhere and everywhere<br>
 without having to come to the temple in Jerusalem. It was<br>
 inflammable material surely and it was easy to misrepresent and<br>
 hard to clear up. <B>{This Jesus of Nazareth}</B> <b><i>(\I&#275;sous ho Naz&#333;raios<br>
 houtos\)</i></b>. With contempt.<br>
 <br>
 6:15 <B>{As if the face of an angel}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;sei pros&#333;pon aggelou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Even his enemies saw that, wicked as they were. See <!-#-->Ex 34:30<br>
 for the face of Moses when he came down from Sinai <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 3:7)</i></b>.<br>
 Page quotes Tennyson: "God's glory smote him on the face." Where<br>
 were Peter and John at this crisis? Apparently Stephen stands<br>
 alone before the Sanhedrin as Jesus did. But he was not alone for<br>
 he saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 7:56)</i></b>. There<br>
 was little that Peter and John could have done if they had been<br>
 present. Gamaliel did not interpose this time for the Pharisees<br>
 were behind the charges against Stephen, false though they were<br>
 as Gamaliel could have found out.<br>
