<p>6:1 <B>{Take heed}</B> <b><i>(\prosechete\)</i></b>. The Greek idiom includes "mind"<br>
 <b><i>(\noun\)</i></b> which is often expressed in ancient Greek and once in<br>
 the Septuagint <b><i>(<!-#-->Job 7:17)</i></b>. In the New Testament the substantive<br>
 \nous\ is understood. It means to "hold the mind on a matter,"<br>
 take pains, take heed. "Righteousness" <b><i>(\dikaiosun&#275;n\)</i></b> is the<br>
 correct text in this verse. Three specimens of the Pharisaic<br>
 "righteousness" are given <b><i>(alms, prayer, fasting)</i></b>. <B>{To be seen}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\theath&#275;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist passive infinitive of purpose. Our<br>
 word _theatrical_ is this very word, spectacular performance.<br>
 <B>{With your Father}</B> <b><i>(\para t&#333;i patri hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Literally "beside<br>
 your Father," standing by his side, as he looks at it.<br>
 <br>
 6:2 <B>{Sound not a trumpet}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; salpis&#275;is\)</i></b>. Is this literal or<br>
 metaphorical? No actual instance of such conduct has been found<br>
 in the Jewish writings. McNeile suggests that it may refer to the<br>
 blowing of trumpets in the streets on the occasion of public<br>
 fasts. Vincent suggests the thirteen trumpet-shaped chests of the<br>
 temple treasury to receive contributions <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 21:2)</i></b>. But at<br>
 Winona Lake one summer a missionary from India named Levering<br>
 stated to me that he had seen Hindu priests do precisely this<br>
 very thing to get a crowd to see their beneficences. So it looks<br>
 as if the rabbis could do it also. Certainly it was in keeping<br>
 with their love of praise. And Jesus expressly says that "the<br>
 hypocrites" <b><i>(\hoi hupokritai\)</i></b> do this very thing. This is an old<br>
 word for actor, interpreter, one who personates another, from<br>
 \hupokrinomai\ to answer in reply like the Attic \apokrinomai\.<br>
 Then to pretend, to feign, to dissemble, to act the hypocrite, to<br>
 wear a mask. This is the hardest word that Jesus has for any<br>
 class of people and he employs it for these pious pretenders who<br>
 pose as perfect. <B>{They have received their reward}</B> <b><i>(\apechousin<br>
 ton misthon aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. This verb is common in the papyri for<br>
 receiving a receipt, "they have their receipt in full," all the<br>
 reward that they will get, this public notoriety. "They can sign<br>
 the receipt of their reward" <b><i>(Deissmann, _Bible Studies_, p.<br>
 229)</i></b>. So _Light from the Ancient East_, pp. 110f. \Apoch&#275;\ means<br>
 "receipt." So also in <!-#-->6:5.<br>
 <br>
 6:4 <B>{In secret}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i krupt&#333;i\)</i></b>. The Textus Receptus added the<br>
 words \en t&#333;i phaner&#333;i\ <b><i>(openly)</i></b> here and in <!-#-->6:6, but they are<br>
 not genuine. Jesus does not promise a _public_ reward for private<br>
 piety.<br>
 <br>
 6:5 <B>{In the synagogues and in the corners of the streets}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 tais sunag&#333;gais kai en tais g&#333;niais t&#333;n platei&#333;n\)</i></b>. These were<br>
 the usual places of prayer <b><i>(synagogues)</i></b> and the street corners<br>
 where crowds stopped for business or talk. If the hour of prayer<br>
 overtook a Pharisee here, he would strike his attitude of prayer<br>
 like a modern Moslem that men might see that he was pious.<br>
 <br>
 6:6 <B>{Into thy closet}</B> <b><i>(\eis to tameion\)</i></b>. The word is a late<br>
 syncopated form of \tamieion\ from \tamias\ <b><i>(steward)</i></b> and the<br>
 root \tam-\ from \temn&#333;\, to cut. So it is a store-house, a<br>
 separate apartment, one's private chamber, closet, or "den" where<br>
 he can withdraw from the world and shut the world out and commune<br>
 with God.<br>
 <br>
 6:7 <B>{Use not vain repetitions}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; battalog&#275;s&#275;te\)</i></b>. Used of<br>
 stammerers who repeat the words, then mere babbling or<br>
 chattering, empty repetition. The etymology is uncertain, but it<br>
 is probably onomatopoetic like "babble." The worshippers of Baal<br>
 on Mount Carmel <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ki 8:26)</i></b> and of Diana in the amphitheatre at<br>
 Ephesus who yelled for two hours <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 19:34)</i></b> are examples. The<br>
 Mohammedans may also be cited who seem to think that they "will<br>
 be heard for their much speaking" <b><i>(\en t&#275;i polulogi&#257;i\)</i></b>. Vincent<br>
 adds "and the Romanists with their _paternosters_ and _avast_."<br>
 The Syriac Sinaitic has it: "Do not be saying idle things."<br>
 Certainly Jesus does not mean to condemn all repetition in prayer<br>
 since he himself prayed three times in Gethsemane "saying the<br>
 same words again" <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 26:44)</i></b>. "As the Gentiles do," says Jesus.<br>
 "The Pagans thought that by endless repetitions and many words<br>
 they would inform their gods as to their needs and weary them<br>
 <b><i>('_fatigare deos_')</i></b> into granting their requests" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:9 <B>{After this manner therefore pray ye}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s oun<br>
 proseuchesthe humeis\)</i></b>. "You" expressed in contrast with "the<br>
 Gentiles." It should be called "The Model Prayer" rather than<br>
 "The Lord's Prayer." "Thus" pray as he gives them a model. He<br>
 himself did not use it as a liturgy <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Joh 17)</i></b>. There is no<br>
 evidence that Jesus meant it for liturgical use by others. In <!-#-->Lu<br>
 11:2-4 practically the same prayer though briefer is given at a<br>
 later time by Jesus to the apostles in response to a request that<br>
 he teach them how to pray. McNeile argues that the form in Luke<br>
 is the original to which Matthew has made additions: "The<br>
 tendency of liturgical formulas is towards enrichment rather than<br>
 abbreviation." But there is no evidence whatever that Jesus<br>
 designed it as a set formula. There is no real harm in a<br>
 liturgical formula if one likes it, but no one sticks to just one<br>
 formula in prayer. There is good and not harm in children<br>
 learning and saying this noble prayer. Some people are disturbed<br>
 over the words "Our Father" and say that no one has a right to<br>
 call God Father who has not been "born again." But that is to say<br>
 that an unconverted sinner cannot pray until he is converted, an<br>
 absurd contradiction. God is the Father of all men in one sense;<br>
 the recognition of Him as the Father in the full sense is the<br>
 first step in coming back to him in regeneration and conversion.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Hallowed be thy name}</B> <b><i>(\hagiasth&#275;t&#333; to onoma sou\)</i></b>. In the Greek<br>
 the verb comes first as in the petitions in verse <!-#-->10. They are<br>
 all aorist imperatives, punctiliar action expressing urgency.<br>
 <br>
 6:11 <B>{Our daily bread}</B> <b><i>(\ton arton h&#275;m&#333;n ton epiousion\)</i></b>. This<br>
 adjective "daily" <b><i>(\epiousion\)</i></b> coming after "Give us this day"<br>
 <b><i>(\dos h&#275;m&#338;n s&#275;meron\)</i></b> has given expositors a great deal of<br>
 trouble. The effort has been made to derive it from \epi\ and<br>
 \&#333;n\ <b><i>(\ousa\)</i></b>. It clearly comes from \epi\ and \i&#333;n\ <b><i>(\epi\ and<br>
 \eimi\)</i></b> like \t&#275;i epious&#275;i\ <b><i>("on the coming day," "the next day,"<br>
 <!-#-->Ac 16:12)</i></b>. But the adjective \epiousios\ is rare and Origen<br>
 said it was made by the Evangelists Matthew and Luke to reproduce<br>
 the idea of an Aramaic original. Moulton and Milligan,<br>
 _Vocabulary_ say: "The papyri have as yet shed no clear light<br>
 upon this difficult word <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 6:11; Lu 11:3)</i></b>, which was in all<br>
 probability a new coinage by the author of the Greek Q to render<br>
 his Aramaic Original" <b><i>(this in 1919)</i></b>. Deissmann claims that only<br>
 about fifty purely New Testament or "Christian" words can be<br>
 admitted out of the more than 5,000 used. "But when a word is not<br>
 recognizable at sight as a Jewish or Christian new formation, we<br>
 must consider it as an ordinary Greek word until the contrary is<br>
 proved. \Epiousios\ has all the appearance of a word that<br>
 originated in trade and traffic of the everyday life of the<br>
 people <b><i>(cf. my hints in _Neutestamentliche Studien Georg Heinrici<br>
 dargebracht_, Leipzig, 1914, pp. 118f.)</i></b>. The opinion here<br>
 expressed has been confirmed by A. Debrunner's discovery <b><i>(_Theol.<br>
 Lit. Ztg_. 1925, Col. 119)</i></b> of \epiousios\ in an ancient<br>
 housekeeping book" <b><i>(_Light from the Ancient East_, New ed. 1927,<br>
 p. 78 and note 1)</i></b>. So then it is not a word coined by the<br>
 Evangelist or by Q to express an Aramaic original. The word<br>
 occurs also in three late MSS. after 2Macc. 1:8, \tous<br>
 epiousious\ after \tous artous\. The meaning, in view of the<br>
 kindred participle <b><i>(\epious&#275;i\)</i></b> in <!-#-->Ac 16:12, seems to be "for<br>
 the coming day," a daily prayer for the needs of the next day as<br>
 every housekeeper understands like the housekeeping book<br>
 discovered by Debrunner.<br>
 <br>
 6:12 <B>{Our debts}</B> <b><i>(\ta opheil&#275;mata h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 11:4)</i></b> has<br>
 "sins" <b><i>(\hamartias\)</i></b>. In the ancient Greek \opheil&#275;ma\ is common<br>
 for actual legal debts as in <!-#-->Ro 4:4, but here it is used of<br>
 moral and spiritual debts to God. "Trespasses" is a<br>
 mistranslation made common by the Church of England Prayer Book.<br>
 It is correct in verse <!-#-->14 in Christ's argument about prayer,<br>
 but it is not in the Model Prayer itself. See <!-#-->Mt 18:28,30 for<br>
 sin pictured again by Christ "as debt and the sinner as a debtor"<br>
 <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. We are thus described as having wronged God. The word<br>
 \opheil&#275;\ for moral obligation was once supposed to be peculiar<br>
 to the New Testament. But it is common in that sense in the<br>
 papyri <b><i>(Deismann, _Bible Studies_, p. 221; _Light from the<br>
 Ancient East,_ New ed., p. 331)</i></b>. We ask forgiveness "in<br>
 proportion as" <b><i>(\h&#333;s\)</i></b> we _also_ have forgiven those in debt to<br>
 us, a most solemn reflection. \Aph&#275;kamen\ is one of the three k<br>
 aorists <b><i>(\eth&#275;ka, ed&#333;ka, h&#275;ka\)</i></b>. It means to send away, to<br>
 dismiss, to wipe off.<br>
 <br>
 6:13 <B>{And bring us not into temptation}</B> <b><i>(\kai m&#275; eisenegk&#275;is eis<br>
 peirasmon\)</i></b>. "Bring" or "lead" bothers many people. It seems to<br>
 present God as an active agent in subjecting us to temptation, a<br>
 thing specifically denied in <!-#-->Jas 1:13. The word here translated<br>
 "temptation" <b><i>(\peirasmon\)</i></b> means originally "trial" or "test" as<br>
 in <!-#-->Jas 1:2 and Vincent so takes it here. _Braid Scots_ has it:<br>
 "And lat us no be siftit." But God does test or sift us, though<br>
 he does not tempt us to evil. No one understood temptation so<br>
 well as Jesus for the devil tempted him by every avenue of<br>
 approach to all kinds of sin, but without success. In the Garden<br>
 of Gethsemane Jesus will say to Peter, James, and John: "Pray<br>
 that ye enter not into temptation" <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:40)</i></b>. That is the idea<br>
 here. Here we have a "Permissive imperative" as grammarians term<br>
 it. The idea is then: "Do not allow us to be led into<br>
 temptation." There is a way out <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 10:13)</i></b>, but it is a<br>
 terrible risk.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{From the evil one}</B> <b><i>(\apo tou pon&#275;rou\)</i></b>. The ablative case in the<br>
 Greek obscures the gender. We have no way of knowing whether it<br>
 is \ho pon&#275;ros\ <b><i>(the evil one)</i></b> or \to pon&#275;ron\ <b><i>(the evil thing)</i></b>.<br>
 And if it is masculine and so \ho pon&#275;ros\, it can either refer<br>
 to the devil as the Evil One _par excellence_ or the evil man<br>
 whoever he may be who seeks to do us ill. The word \pon&#275;ros\ has<br>
 a curious history coming from \ponos\ <b><i>(toil)</i></b> and \pone&#333;\ <b><i>(to<br>
 work)</i></b>. It reflects the idea either that work is bad or that this<br>
 particular work is bad and so the bad idea drives out the good in<br>
 work or toil, an example of human depravity surely.<br>
 <br>
 The Doxology is placed in the margin of the Revised Version. It<br>
 is wanting in the oldest and best Greek manuscripts. The earliest<br>
 forms vary very much, some shorter, some longer than the one in<br>
 the Authorized Version. The use of a doxology arose when this<br>
 prayer began to be used as a liturgy to be recited or to be<br>
 chanted in public worship. It was not an original part of the<br>
 Model Prayer as given by Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 6:14 <B>{Trespasses}</B> <b><i>(\parapt&#333;mata\)</i></b>. This is no part of the Model<br>
 Prayer. The word "trespass" is literally "falling to one side," a<br>
 lapse or deviation from truth or uprightness. The ancients<br>
 sometimes used it of intentional falling or attack upon one's<br>
 enemy, but "slip" or "fault" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 6:1)</i></b> is the common New<br>
 Testament idea. \Parabasis\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 5:14)</i></b> is a positive violation,<br>
 a transgression, conscious stepping aside or across.<br>
 <br>
 6:16 <B>{Of a sad countenance}</B> <b><i>(\skuthr&#333;poi\)</i></b>. Only here and <!-#-->Lu<br>
 24:17 in the N.T. It is a compound of \skuthros\ <b><i>(sullen)</i></b> and<br>
 \ops\ <b><i>(countenance)</i></b>. These actors or hypocrites "put on a gloomy<br>
 look" <b><i>(Goodspeed)</i></b> and, if necessary, even "disfigure their faces"<br>
 <b><i>(\aphanizousin ta pros&#333;pa aut&#333;n\)</i></b>, that they may look like they<br>
 are fasting. It is this pretence of piety that Jesus so sharply<br>
 ridicules. There is a play on the Greek words \aphanizousi\<br>
 <b><i>(disfigure)</i></b> and \phan&#333;sin\ <b><i>(figure)</i></b>. They conceal their real<br>
 looks that they may seem to be fasting, conscious and pretentious<br>
 hypocrisy.<br>
 <br>
 6:18 <B>{In secret}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i kruphai&#333;i\)</i></b>. Here as in <!-#-->6:4,6 the<br>
 Textus Receptus adds \en t&#333;i phaner&#333;i\ <b><i>(openly)</i></b>, but it is not<br>
 genuine. The word \kruphaios\ is here alone in the New Testament,<br>
 but occurs four times in the Septuagint.<br>
 <br>
 6:19 <B>{Lay not up for yourselves treasures}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; th&#275;saurizete<br>
 humin th&#275;saurous\)</i></b>. Do not have this habit <b><i>(\m&#275;\ and the present<br>
 imperative)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 2:11 for the word "treasure." Here there<br>
 is a play on the word, "treasure not for yourselves treasures."<br>
 Same play in verse <!-#-->20 with the cognate accusative. In both<br>
 verses \humin\ is dative of personal interest and is not<br>
 reflexive, but the ordinary personal pronoun. Wycliff has it: "Do<br>
 not treasure to you treasures."<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Break through}</B> <b><i>(\diorussousin\)</i></b>. Literally "dig through." Easy<br>
 to do through the mud walls or sun-dried bricks. Today they can<br>
 pierce steel safes that are no longer safe even if a foot thick.<br>
 The Greeks called a burglar a "mud-digger" <b><i>(\toichoruchos\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:20 <B>{Rust}</B> <b><i>(\br&#333;sis\)</i></b>. Something that "eats" <b><i>(\bibr&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b> or<br>
 "gnaws" or "corrodes."<br>
 <br>
 6:22 <B>{Single}</B> <b><i>(\haplous\)</i></b>. Used of a marriage contract when the<br>
 husband is to repay the dowry "pure and simple" <b><i>(\t&#275;n phern&#275;n<br>
 hapl&#275;n\)</i></b>, if she is set free; but in case he does not do so<br>
 promptly, he is to add interest also <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan's<br>
 _Vocabulary_, etc.)</i></b>. There are various other instances of such<br>
 usage. Here and in <!-#-->Lu 11:34 the eye is called "single" in a<br>
 moral sense. The word means "without folds" like a piece of cloth<br>
 unfolded, _simplex_ in Latin. Bruce considers this parable of the<br>
 eye difficult. "The figure and the ethical meaning seem to be<br>
 mixed up, moral attributes ascribed to the physical eye which<br>
 with them still gives light to the body. This confusion may be<br>
 due to the fact that the eye, besides being the organ of vision,<br>
 is the seat of expression, revealing inward dispositions." The<br>
 "evil" eye <b><i>(\pon&#275;ros\)</i></b> may be diseased and is used of stinginess<br>
 in the LXX and so \haplous\ may refer to liberality as Hatch<br>
 argues <b><i>(_Essays in Biblical Greek_, p. 80)</i></b>. The passage may be<br>
 elliptical with something to be supplied. If our eyes are healthy<br>
 we see clearly and with a single focus <b><i>(without astigmatism)</i></b>. If<br>
 the eyes are diseased <b><i>(bad, evil)</i></b>, they may even be cross-eyed or<br>
 cock-eyed. We see double and confuse our vision. We keep one eye<br>
 on the hoarded treasures of earth and roll the other proudly up<br>
 to heaven. Seeing double is double-mindedness as is shown in<br>
 verse <!-#-->24.<br>
 <br>
 6:24 <B>{No man can serve two masters}</B> <b><i>(\oudeis dunatai dusi kuriois<br>
 douleuein\)</i></b>. Many try it, but failure awaits them all. Men even<br>
 try "to be slaves to God and mammon" <b><i>(\The&#333;i douleuein kai<br>
 mam&#333;n&#257;i\)</i></b>. Mammon is a Chaldee, Syriac, and Punic word like<br>
 _Plutus_ for the money-god <b><i>(or devil)</i></b>. The slave of mammon will<br>
 obey mammon while pretending to obey God. The United States has<br>
 had a terrible revelation of the power of the money-god in public<br>
 life in the Sinclair-Fall-Teapot-Air-Dome-Oil case. When the<br>
 guide is blind and leads the blind, both fall into the ditch. The<br>
 man who cannot tell road from ditch sees falsely as Ruskin shows<br>
 in _Modern Painters_. He will hold to one <b><i>(\henos anthexetai\)</i></b>.<br>
 The word means to line up face to face <b><i>(\anti\)</i></b> with one man and<br>
 so against the other.<br>
 <br>
 6:25 <B>{Be not anxious for your life}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; merimnate t&#275;i psuch&#275;i<br>
 h&#8211;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. This is as good a translation as the Authorized Version<br>
 was poor; "Take no thought for your life." The old English word<br>
 "thought" meant anxiety or worry as Shakespeare says:<br>
 <br>
   "The native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale<br>
 cast of thought."<br>
 <br>
 Vincent quotes Bacon <b><i>(Henry VII)</i></b>: "Harris, an alderman of London,<br>
 was put in trouble and died with thought and anguish." But words<br>
 change with time and now this passage is actually quoted<br>
 <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b> "as an objection to the moral teaching of the Sermon<br>
 on the Mount, on the ground that it encouraged, nay, commanded, a<br>
 reckless neglect of the future." We have narrowed the word to<br>
 mere planning without any notion of anxiety which is in the Greek<br>
 word. The verb \merimna&#333;\ is from \meris, meriz&#333;\, because care<br>
 or anxiety distracts and divides. It occurs in Christ's rebuke to<br>
 Martha for her excessive solicitude about something to eat <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 10:41)</i></b>. The notion of proper care and forethought appears in<br>
 <!-#-->1Co 7:32; 12:25; Php 2:20. It is here the present imperative<br>
 with the negative, a command not to have the habit of petulant<br>
 worry about food and clothing, a source of anxiety to many<br>
 housewives, a word for women especially as the command not to<br>
 worship mammon may be called a word for men. The command can mean<br>
 that they must stop such worry if already indulging in it. In<br>
 verse <!-#-->31 Jesus repeats the prohibition with the ingressive<br>
 aorist subjunctive: "Do not become anxious," "Do not grow<br>
 anxious." Here the direct question with the deliberative<br>
 subjunctive occurs with each verb <b><i>(\phag&#333;men, pi&#333;men,<br>
 peribal&#333;metha\)</i></b>. This deliberative subjunctive of the direct<br>
 question is retained in the indirect question employed in verse<br>
 <!-#-->25. A different verb for clothing occurs, both in the indirect<br>
 middle <b><i>(\peribal&#333;metha\, fling round ourselves in <!-#-->31,<br>
 \endus&#275;sthe\, put on yourselves in <!-#-->25)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{For your life}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i psuch&#275;i\)</i></b>. "Here \psuch&#275;i\ stands for the<br>
 life principle common to man and beast, which is embodied in the<br>
 \s&#333;ma\: the former needs food, the latter clothing" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 \Psuch&#275;\ in the Synoptic Gospels occurs in three senses<br>
 <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>: either the life principle in the body as here and<br>
 which man may kill <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 3:4)</i></b> or the seat of the thoughts and<br>
 emotions on a par with \kardia\ and \dianoia\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 22:37)</i></b> and<br>
 \pneuma\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:46; cf. <!-#-->Joh 12:27; 13:21)</i></b> or something higher<br>
 that makes up the real self <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:28; 16:26)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Mt 16:25<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:25)</i></b> \psuch&#275;\ appears in two senses paradoxical use,<br>
 saving life and losing it.<br>
 <br>
 6:27 <B>{Unto his stature}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;n h&#275;likian autou\)</i></b>. The word<br>
 \h&#275;likian\ is used either of height <b><i>(stature)</i></b> or length of life<br>
 <b><i>(age)</i></b>. Either makes good sense here, though probably "stature"<br>
 suits the context best. Certainly anxiety will not help either<br>
 kind of growth, but rather hinder by auto-intoxication if nothing<br>
 more. This is no plea for idleness, for even the birds are<br>
 diligent and the flowers grow.<br>
 <br>
 6:28 <B>{The lilies of the field}</B> <b><i>(\ta krina tou agrou\)</i></b>. The word<br>
 may include other wild flowers besides lilies, blossoms like<br>
 anemones, poppies, gladioli, irises <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:29 <B>{Was not arrayed}</B> <b><i>(\oude periebaleto\)</i></b>. Middle voice and so<br>
 "did not clothe himself," "did not put around himself."<br>
 <br>
 6:30 <B>{The grass of the field}</B> <b><i>(\ton chorton tou agrou\)</i></b>. The<br>
 common grass of the field. This heightens the comparison.<br>
 <br>
 6:33 <B>{First his kingdom}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;ton t&#275;n basileian\)</i></b>. This in answer<br>
 to those who see in the Sermon on the Mount only ethical<br>
 comments. Jesus in the Beatitudes drew the picture of the man<br>
 with the new heart. Here he places the Kingdom of God and his<br>
 righteousness before temporal blessings <b><i>(food and clothing)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 6:34 <B>{For the morrow}</B> <b><i>(\eis ten aurion\)</i></b>. The last resort of the<br>
 anxious soul when all other fears are allayed. The ghost of<br>
 tomorrow stalks out with all its hobgoblins of doubt and<br>
 distrust.<br>
 <br>
