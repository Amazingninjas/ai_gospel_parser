<p>21:1 <B>{Unto Bethphage}</B> <b><i>(\eis Bethphag&#275;\)</i></b>. An indeclinable Aramaic<br>
 name here only in O.T. or N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 11:1; Lu 19:29)</i></b>. It means<br>
 "house of unripe young figs." It apparently lay on the eastern<br>
 slope of Olivet or at the foot of the mountain, a little further<br>
 from Jerusalem than Bethany. Both Mark and Luke speak of Christ's<br>
 coming "unto Bethphage and Bethany" as if Bethphage was reached<br>
 first. It is apparently larger than Bethany. <B>{Unto the Mount of<br>
 Olives}</B> <b><i>(\eis to oros t&#333;n Elai&#333;n\)</i></b>. Matthew has thus three<br>
 instances of \eis\ with Jerusalem, Mount of Olives. Mark and Luke<br>
 use \pros\ with Mount of Olives, the Mount of Olive trees<br>
 <b><i>(\elai&#333;n\ from \elaia\, olive tree)</i></b>, the mountain covered with<br>
 olive trees.<br>
 <br>
 21:2 <B>{Into the village that is over against you}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n k&#333;m&#275;n<br>
 t&#275;n katenanti h&#8211;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. Another use of \eis\. If it means "into"<br>
 as translated, it could be Bethany right across the valley and<br>
 this is probably the idea. <B>{And a colt with her}</B> <b><i>(\kai p&#333;lon met'<br>
 aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. The young of any animal. Here to come with the mother<br>
 and the more readily so.<br>
 <br>
 21:3 <B>{The Lord}</B> <b><i>(\ho kurios\)</i></b>. It is not clear how the word would<br>
 be understood here by those who heard the message though it is<br>
 plain that Jesus applies it to himself. The word is from \kuros\,<br>
 power or authority. In the LXX it is common in a variety of uses<br>
 which appear in the N.T. as master of the slave <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:24)</i></b>, of<br>
 the harvest <b><i>(<!-#-->9:38)</i></b>, of the vineyard <b><i>(<!-#-->20:8)</i></b>, of the emperor<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 13:27)</i></b>, of God <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 11:20; 11:25)</i></b>, and often of Jesus as<br>
 the Messiah <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10:36)</i></b>. Note <!-#-->Mt 8:25. This is the only time<br>
 in Matthew where the words \ho kurios\ are applied to Jesus<br>
 except the doubtful passage in <!-#-->28:6. A similar usage is shown<br>
 by Moulton and Milligan's _Vocabulary_ and Deissmann's _Light<br>
 from the Ancient East_. Particularly in Egypt it was applied to<br>
 "the Lord Serapis" and Ptolemy and Cleopatra are called "the<br>
 lords, the most great gods" <b><i>(\hoi kurioi theoi megistoi\)</i></b>. Even<br>
 Herod the Great and Herod Agrippa I are addressed as "Lord King."<br>
 In the west the Roman emperors are not so termed till the time of<br>
 Domitian. But the Christians boldly claimed the word for Christ<br>
 as Jesus is here represented as using it with reference to<br>
 himself. It seems as if already the disciples were calling Jesus<br>
 "Lord" and that he accepted the appellative and used it as here.<br>
 <br>
 21:4 <B>{By the prophet}</B> <b><i>(\dia tou proph&#275;tou\)</i></b>. The first line is<br>
 from <!-#-->Isa 62:11, the rest from <!-#-->Zec 9:9. John <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 12:14f.)</i></b><br>
 makes it clear that Jesus did not quote the passage himself. In<br>
 Matthew it is not so plain, but probably it is his own comment<br>
 about the incident. It is not Christ's intention to fulfil the<br>
 prophecy, simply that his conduct did fulfil it.<br>
 <br>
 21:5 <B>{The daughter of Zion}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i thugatri Si&#333;n\)</i></b>. Jerusalem as<br>
 in <!-#-->Isa 22:4 <b><i>(daughter of my people)</i></b>. So Babylon <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 47:1)</i></b>,<br>
 daughter of Tyre for Tyre <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps 45:12)</i></b>. <B>{Riding}</B> <b><i>(\epibeb&#275;k&#333;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Perfect active participle of \epibain&#333;\, "having gone upon." <B>{And<br>
 upon a colt the foal of an ass}</B> <b><i>(\kai epi p&#333;lon huion<br>
 hupozugiou\)</i></b>. These words give trouble if \kai\ is here taken to<br>
 mean "and." Fritzsche argues that Jesus rode alternately upon<br>
 each animal, a possible, but needless interpretation. In the<br>
 Hebrew it means by common Hebrew parallelism "upon an ass, even<br>
 upon a colt." That is obviously the meaning here in Matthew. The<br>
 use of \hupozugiou\ <b><i>(a beast of burden, under a yoke)</i></b> for ass is<br>
 common in the LXX and in the papyri <b><i>(Deissmann, _Bible Studies_<br>
 p. 161)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 21:7 <B>{And he sat thereon}</B> <b><i>(\kai epekathisen epan&#333; aut&#333;n\)</i></b>, Mark<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 11:7)</i></b> and Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 19:35)</i></b> show that Jesus rode the colt.<br>
 Matthew does not contradict that, referring to the garments <b><i>(\ta<br>
 himatia\)</i></b> put on the colt by "them" <b><i>(\aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. not to the two<br>
 asses. The construction is somewhat loose, but intelligible. The<br>
 garments thrown on the animals were the outer garments<br>
 <b><i>(\himatia\)</i></b>, Jesus "took his seat" <b><i>(\epekathisen\, ingressive<br>
 aorist active)</i></b> upon the garments.<br>
 <br>
 21:8 <B>{The most part of the multitude}</B> <b><i>(\ho pleistos ochlos\)</i></b>. See<br>
 <!-#-->11:20 for this same idiom, article with superlative, a true<br>
 superlative <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 670)</i></b>. <B>{In the way}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i<br>
 hod&#333;i\)</i></b>. This the most of the crowd did. The disciples put their<br>
 garments on the asses. Note change of tenses <b><i>(constative aorist<br>
 \estr&#333;san\, descriptive imperfects \ekopton kai estr&#333;nnuon\<br>
 showing the growing enthusiasm of the crowd)</i></b>. When the colt had<br>
 passed over their garments, they would pick the garments up and<br>
 spread them again before.<br>
 <br>
 21:9 <B>{That went before him and that followed}</B> <b><i>(\hoi proagontes<br>
 auton kai hoi akolouthountes\)</i></b>. Note the two groups with two<br>
 articles and the present tense <b><i>(linear action)</i></b> and the imperfect<br>
 \ekrazon\ "were crying" as they went. <B>{Hosanna to the Son of<br>
 David}</B> <b><i>(\Hosanna t&#333;i hui&#333;i Daueid\)</i></b>. They were now proclaiming<br>
 Jesus as the Messiah and he let them do it. "Hosanna" means<br>
 "Save, we pray thee." They repeat words from the _Hallel_ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps<br>
 148:1)</i></b> and one recalls the song of the angelic host when Jesus<br>
 was born <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:14)</i></b>. "Hosanna in the highest" <b><i>(heaven)</i></b> as well<br>
 as here on earth.<br>
 <br>
 21:10 <B>{Was stirred}</B> <b><i>(\eseisth&#275;\)</i></b>. Shaken as by an earthquake.<br>
 "Even Jerusalem frozen with religious formalism and socially<br>
 undemonstrative, was stirred with popular enthusiasm as by a<br>
 mighty wind or by an earthquake" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 21:12 <B>{Cast out}</B> <b><i>(\exebalen\)</i></b>. Drove out, assumed authority over<br>
 "the temple of God" <b><i>(probably correct text with \tou theou\,<br>
 though only example of the phrase)</i></b>. John <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 2:14)</i></b> has a<br>
 similar incident at the beginning of the ministry of Jesus. It is<br>
 not impossible that he should repeat it at the close after three<br>
 years with the same abuses in existence again. It is amazing how<br>
 short a time the work of reformers lasts. The traffic went on in<br>
 the court of the Gentiles and to a certain extent was necessary.<br>
 Here the tables of <B>{the money-changers}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n kollubist&#333;n\, from<br>
 \kollubos\, a small coin)</i></b> were overturned. See on &#175;17:24 for the<br>
 need of the change for the temple tax. The doves were the poor<br>
 man's offering.<br>
 <br>
 21:13 <B>{A den of robbers}</B> <b><i>(\sp&#275;laion l&#275;ist&#333;n\)</i></b>. By charging<br>
 exorbitant prices.<br>
 <br>
 21:15 <B>{The children}</B> <b><i>(\tous paidas\)</i></b>. Masculine and probably boys<br>
 who had caught the enthusiasm of the crowd.<br>
 <br>
 21:16 <B>{Hearest thou}</B> <b><i>(\akoueis\)</i></b>. In a rage at the desecration of<br>
 the temple by the shouts of the boys they try to shame Jesus, as<br>
 responsible for it.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Thou hast perfected}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;rtis&#333;\)</i></b>. The quotation is from <!-#-->Ps<br>
 8:3 <b><i>(LXX text)</i></b>. See <!-#-->4:21 where the same verb is used for<br>
 mending nets. Here it is the timeless aorist middle indicative<br>
 with the perfective use of \kata-\. It was a stinging rebuke.<br>
 <br>
 21:17 <B>{To Bethany}</B> <b><i>(\eis B&#275;thanian\)</i></b>. House of depression or<br>
 misery, the Hebrew means. But the home of Martha and Mary and<br>
 Lazarus there was a house of solace and comfort to Jesus during<br>
 this week of destiny. He <B>{lodged there}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;ulisth&#275; ekei\)</i></b> whether<br>
 at the Bethany home or out in the open air. It was a time of<br>
 crisis for all.<br>
 <br>
 21:18 <B>{He hungered}</B> <b><i>(\epeinasen\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist indicative,<br>
 became hungry, felt hungry <b><i>(Moffatt)</i></b>. Possibly Jesus spent the<br>
 night out of doors and so had no breakfast.<br>
 <br>
 21:19 <B>{A fig tree}</B> <b><i>(\suk&#275;n mian\)</i></b>. "A single fig tree" <b><i>(Margin of<br>
 Rev. Version)</i></b>. But \heis\ was often used = \tis\ or like our<br>
 indefinite article. See <!-#-->Mt 8:10; 26:69. The Greek has strictly<br>
 no indefinite article as the Latin has no definite article. <B>{Let<br>
 there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever}</B> <b><i>(\ou m&#275;keti<br>
 sou karpos gen&#275;tai eis ton ai&#333;na\)</i></b>. Strictly speaking this is a<br>
 prediction, not a prohibition or wish as in <!-#-->Mr 11:14 <b><i>(optative<br>
 \phagoi\)</i></b>. "On you no fruit shall ever grow again" <b><i>(Weymouth)</i></b>.<br>
 The double negative \ou m&#275;\ with the aorist subjunctive <b><i>(or<br>
 future indicative)</i></b> is the strongest kind of negative prediction.<br>
 It sometimes amounts to a prohibition like \ou\ and the future<br>
 indicative <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 926f.)</i></b>. The early figs<br>
 start in spring before the leaves and develop after the leaves.<br>
 The main fig crop was early autumn <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 11:14)</i></b>. There should<br>
 have been figs on the tree with the crop of leaves. It was a<br>
 vivid object lesson. Matthew does not distinguish between the two<br>
 mornings as Mark does <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 11:13,20)</i></b>, but says "immediately"<br>
 <b><i>(\parachr&#275;ma\)</i></b> twice <b><i>(<!-#-->21:19,20)</i></b>. This word is really \para to<br>
 chr&#275;ma\ like our "on the spot" <b><i>(Thayer)</i></b>. It occurs in the papyri<br>
 in monetary transactions for immediate cash payment.<br>
 <br>
 21:21 <B>{Doubt not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; diakrith&#275;te\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 subjunctive, second-class condition. To be divided in mind, to<br>
 waver, to doubt, the opposite of "faith" <b><i>(\pistin\)</i></b>, trust,<br>
 confidence. <B>{What is done to the fig tree}</B> <b><i>(\to t&#275;s suk&#275;s\)</i></b>. The<br>
 Greek means "the matter of the fig tree," as if a slight matter<br>
 in comparison with <B>{this mountain}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i orei tout&#333;i\)</i></b>. Removing<br>
 a mountain is a bigger task than blighting a fig tree. "The<br>
 cursing of the fig-tree has always been regarded as of symbolic<br>
 import, the tree being in Christ's mind an emblem of the Jewish<br>
 people, with a great show of religion and no fruit of real<br>
 godliness. This hypothesis is very credible" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Plummer<br>
 follows Zahn in referring it to the Holy City. Certainly "this<br>
 mountain" is a parable and one already reported in <!-#-->Mt 17:20<br>
 <b><i>(cf. sycamine tree in <!-#-->Lk 17:6)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Zec 17:4.<br>
 <br>
 21:22 <B>{Believing}</B> <b><i>(\pisteuontes\)</i></b>. This is the point of the<br>
 parable of the mountain, "faith in the efficacy of prayer"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 21:24 <B>{One question}</B> <b><i>(\logon hena\)</i></b>. Literally "one word" or "a<br>
 word." The answer to Christ's word will give the answer to their<br>
 query. The only human ecclesiastical authority that Jesus had<br>
 came from John.<br>
 <br>
 21:25 <B>{The baptism of John}</B> <b><i>(\to baptisma to I&#333;anou\)</i></b>. This<br>
 represents his relation to Jesus who was baptized by him. At once<br>
 the ecclesiastical leaders find themselves in a dilemma created<br>
 by their challenge of Christ. <B>{They reasoned with themselves}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dielogizonto\)</i></b>. Picturesque imperfect tense describing their<br>
 hopeless quandary.<br>
 <br>
 21:29 <B>{I will not}</B> <b><i>(\ou thel&#333;\)</i></b>. So many old manuscripts, though<br>
 the Vatican manuscript <b><i>(B)</i></b> has the order of the two sons<br>
 reversed. Logically the "I, sir" <b><i>(\eg&#333;, kurie\)</i></b> suits better for<br>
 the second son <b><i>(verse <!-#-->30)</i></b> with a reference to the blunt refusal<br>
 of the first. So also the manuscripts differ in verse <!-#-->31<br>
 between the first <b><i>(\ho pr&#333;tos\)</i></b> and the last <b><i>(\ho husteros\ or<br>
 \eschatos\)</i></b>. But the one who actually did the will of the father<br>
 is the one who <B>{repented and went}</B> <b><i>(\metamel&#275;theis ap&#275;lthen\)</i></b>.<br>
 This word really means "repent," to be sorry afterwards, and must<br>
 be sharply distinguished from the word \metanoe&#333;\ used 34 times<br>
 in the N.T. as in <!-#-->Mt 3:2 and \metanoia\ used 24 times as in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 3:8. The verb \metamelomai\ occurs in the N.T. only five times<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 21:29,32; 27:3; 2Co 7:8; Heb 7:21 from <!-#-->Ps 109:4)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 distinguishes sharply between mere sorrow and the act<br>
 "repentance" which he calls \metanoian\ <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 7:9)</i></b>. In the case<br>
 of Judas <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:3)</i></b> it was mere remorse. Here the boy got sorry<br>
 for his stubborn refusal to obey his father and went and obeyed.<br>
 Godly sorrow leads to repentance <b><i>(\metanoian\)</i></b>, but mere sorrow<br>
 is not repentance.<br>
 <br>
 21:31 <B>{Go before you}</B> <b><i>(\proagousin\)</i></b>. "In front of you"<br>
 <b><i>(Weymouth)</i></b>. The publicans and harlots march ahead of the<br>
 ecclesiastics into the kingdom of heaven. It is a powerful<br>
 indictment of the complacency of the Jewish theological leaders.<br>
 <br>
 21:32 <B>{In the way of righteousness}</B> <b><i>(\en hod&#333;i dikaiosun&#275;s\)</i></b>. In<br>
 the path of righteousness. Compare the two ways in <!-#-->Mt 7:13,14<br>
 and "the way of God" <b><i>(<!-#-->22:16)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 21:33 <B>{A hedge}</B> <b><i>(\phragmon\)</i></b>. Or fence as a protection against<br>
 wild beasts. <B>{Digged a winepress}</B> <b><i>(\&#333;ruxen l&#275;non\)</i></b>. Out of the<br>
 solid rock to hold the grapes and wine as they were crushed. Such<br>
 wine-vats are to be seen today in Palestine. <B>{Built a tower}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#333;ikodom&#275;sen purgon\)</i></b>. This for the vinedressers and watchmen<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ch 26:10)</i></b>. Utmost care was thus taken. Note "a booth in a<br>
 vineyard" <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 1:8)</i></b>. See also <!-#-->Isa 24:20; Job 27:18. Let it<br>
 out <b><i>(\exedeto, exedoto\ the usual form)</i></b>. For hire, the terms not<br>
 being given. The lease allowed three forms, money-rent, a<br>
 proportion of the crop, or a definite amount of the produce<br>
 whether it was a good or bad year. Probably the last form is that<br>
 contemplated here.<br>
 <br>
 21:34 <B>{His servants}</B> <b><i>(\tous doulous autou\)</i></b>. These slaves are<br>
 distinguished from <B>{the husbandmen}</B> <b><i>(\ge&#333;rgoi\, workers of the<br>
 soil)</i></b> or workers of the vineyard who had leased it from the<br>
 householder before he went away. The conduct of the husbandmen<br>
 towards the householder's slaves portrays the behaviour of the<br>
 Jewish people and the religious leaders in particular towards the<br>
 prophets and now towards Christ. The treatment of God's prophets<br>
 by the Jews pointedly illustrates this parable.<br>
 <br>
 21:35 <B>{They will reverence my son}</B> <b><i>(\entrap&#275;sontai ton huion<br>
 mou\)</i></b>. Second future passive from \entrep&#333;\, to turn at, but used<br>
 transitively here as though active or middle. It is the picture<br>
 of turning with respect when one worthy of it appears.<br>
 <br>
 21:38 <B>{Take his inheritance}</B> <b><i>(\sch&#333;men t&#275;n kl&#275;ronomian autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Ingressive aorist active subjunctive <b><i>(hortatory, volitive)</i></b> of<br>
 \ech&#333;\. Let us get his inheritance.<br>
 <br>
 21:41 <B>{He will miserably destroy those miserable men}</B> <b><i>(\kakous<br>
 kak&#333;s apolesei autous\)</i></b>. The paronomasia or assonance is very<br>
 clear. A common idiom in literary Greek. "He will put the<br>
 wretches to a wretched death" <b><i>(Weymouth)</i></b>. <B>{Which}</B> <b><i>(\hoitines\)</i></b>.<br>
 Who, which very ones of a different character.<br>
 <br>
 21:42 <B>{The stone which}</B> <b><i>(\lithon hon\)</i></b>. Inverse attraction of the<br>
 antecedent into the case of the relative. <B>{The builders rejected}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\apedokimasan hoi oikodomountes\)</i></b>. From <!-#-->Ps 118:22. A most<br>
 telling quotation. These experts in building God's temple had<br>
 rejected the corner-stone chosen by God for his own house. But<br>
 God has the last word and sets aside the building experts and<br>
 puts his Son as the Head of the corner. It was a withering<br>
 indictment.<br>
 <br>
 21:43 <B>{Shall be taken away from you}</B> <b><i>(\arth&#275;setai aph' h&#8211;m&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Future passive indicative of \air&#333;\. It was the death-knell of<br>
 the Jewish nation with their hopes of political and religious<br>
 world leadership.<br>
 <br>
 21:44 <B>{Shall be broken to pieces}</B> <b><i>(\sunthlasth&#275;setai\)</i></b>. Some<br>
 ancient manuscripts do not have this verse. But it graphically<br>
 pictures the fate of the man who rejects Christ. The verb means<br>
 to shatter. We are familiar with an automobile that dashes<br>
 against a stone wall, a tree, or a train and the ruin that<br>
 follows. <B>{Will scatter him as dust}</B> <b><i>(\likm&#275;sei\)</i></b>. The verb was<br>
 used of winnowing out the chaff and then of grinding to powder.<br>
 This is the fate of him on whom this Rejected Stone falls.<br>
 <br>
 21:45 <B>{Perceived}</B> <b><i>(\egn&#333;san\)</i></b>. Ingressive second aorist active of<br>
 \gin&#333;sk&#333;\. There was no mistaking the meaning of these parables.<br>
 The dullest could see the point.<br>
 <br>
 21:46 <B>{Took him}</B> <b><i>(\eichon\)</i></b>. Descriptive imperfect of \ech&#333;\, to<br>
 hold. This fear of the people was all that stayed the hands of<br>
 the rabbis on this occasion. Murderous rage was in their hearts<br>
 towards Jesus. People do not always grasp the application of<br>
 sermons to themselves.<br>
