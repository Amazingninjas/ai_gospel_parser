<p>17:1 <B>{When they had passed through}</B> <b><i>(\diodeusantes\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active participle of \diodeu&#333;\, common verb in the _Koin&#275;_<br>
 <b><i>(Polybius, Plutarch, LXX, etc.)</i></b>, but in the N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 8:1. It means literally to make one's way <b><i>(\hodos\)</i></b> through<br>
 <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b>. They took the Egnatian Way, one of the great Roman roads<br>
 from Byzantium to Dyrrachium <b><i>(over 500 miles long)</i></b> on the<br>
 Adriatic Sea, opposite Brundisium and so an extension of the<br>
 Appian Way. <B>{Amphipolis}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n Amphipolin\)</i></b>. So called because<br>
 the Strymon flowed almost around <b><i>(\amphi\)</i></b> it, the metropolis of<br>
 Macedonia Prima, a free city, about 32 miles from Philippi, about<br>
 three miles from the sea. Paul and Silas may have spent only a<br>
 night here or longer. <B>{Apollonia}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n Apoll&#333;nian\)</i></b>. Not the<br>
 famous Apollonia in Illyria, but 32 miles from Amphipolis on the<br>
 Egnatian Way. So here again a night was spent if no more. Why<br>
 Paul hurried through these two large cities, if he did, we do not<br>
 know. There are many gaps in Luke's narrative that we have no way<br>
 of filling up. There may have been no synagogues for one thing.<br>
 <B>{To Thessalonica}</B> <b><i>(\eis Thessalonik&#275;n\)</i></b>. There was a synagogue<br>
 here in this great commercial city, still an important city<br>
 called Saloniki, of 70,000 population. It was originally called<br>
 Therma, at the head of the Thermaic Gulf. Cassander renamed it<br>
 Thessalonica after his wife, the sister of Alexander the Great.<br>
 It was the capital of the second of the four divisions of<br>
 Macedonia and finally the capital of the whole province. It<br>
 shared with Corinth and Ephesus the commerce of the Aegean. One<br>
 synagogue shows that even in this commercial city the Jews were<br>
 not very numerous. As a political centre it ranked with Antioch<br>
 in Syria and Caesarea in Palestine. It was a strategic centre for<br>
 the spread of the gospel as Paul later said for it sounded<br>
 <b><i>(echoed)</i></b> forth from Thessalonica throughout Macedonia and Achaia<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 1:8)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:2 <B>{As his custom was}</B> <b><i>(\kata to ei&#333;thos t&#333;i Paul&#333;i\)</i></b>. The same<br>
 construction in <!-#-->Lu 4:16 about Jesus in Nazareth <b><i>(\kata to<br>
 ei&#333;thos aut&#333;i\)</i></b> with the second perfect active participle neuter<br>
 singular from \eth&#333;\. Paul's habit was to go to the Jewish<br>
 synagogue to use the Jews and the God-fearers as a springboard<br>
 for his work among the Gentiles. <B>{For three Sabbaths}</B> <b><i>(\epi<br>
 sabbata tria\)</i></b>. Probably the reference is to the first three<br>
 Sabbaths when Paul had a free hand in the synagogue as at first<br>
 in Antioch in Pisidia. Luke does not say that Paul was in<br>
 Thessalonica only three weeks. He may have spoken there also<br>
 during the week, though the Sabbath was the great day. Paul makes<br>
 it plain, as Furneaux shows, that he was in Thessalonica a much<br>
 longer period than three weeks. The rest of the time he spoke, of<br>
 course, outside of the synagogue. Paul implies an extended stay<br>
 by his language in <!-#-->1Th 1:8. The church consisted mainly of<br>
 Gentile converts <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 3:4,7,8)</i></b> and seems to have been well<br>
 organized <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 5:12)</i></b>. He received help while there several<br>
 times from Philippi <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 4:16)</i></b> and even so worked night and day<br>
 to support himself <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 2:9)</i></b>. His preaching was misunderstood<br>
 there in spite of careful instruction concerning the second<br>
 coming of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 4:13-5:5; 2Th 2:1-12)</i></b>. <B>{Reasoned}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dielexato\)</i></b>. First aorist middle indicative of \dialegomai\,<br>
 old verb in the active to select, distinguish, then to revolve in<br>
 the mind, to converse <b><i>(interchange of ideas)</i></b>, then to teach in<br>
 the Socratic <b><i>("dialectic")</i></b> method of question and answer <b><i>(cf.<br>
 \dielegeto\ in verse <!-#-->17)</i></b>, then simply to discourse, but always<br>
 with the idea of intellectual stimulus. With these Jews and<br>
 God-fearers Paul appealed to the Scriptures as text and basis<br>
 <b><i>(\apo\)</i></b> of his ideas.<br>
 <br>
 17:3 <B>{Opening and alleging}</B> <b><i>(\dianoig&#333;n kai paratithemenos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Opening the Scriptures, Luke means, as made plain by the mission<br>
 and message of Jesus, the same word <b><i>(\dianoig&#333;\)</i></b> used by him of<br>
 the interpretation of the Scriptures by Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:32)</i></b> and of<br>
 the opening of the mind of the disciples also by Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 24:45)</i></b> and of the opening of Lydia's heart by the Lord<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->16:14)</i></b>. One cannot refrain from saying that such exposition of<br>
 the Scriptures as Jesus and Paul gave would lead to more opening<br>
 of mind and heart. Paul was not only "expounding" the Scriptures,<br>
 he was also "propounding" <b><i>(the old meaning of "allege")</i></b> his<br>
 doctrine or setting forth alongside the Scriptures<br>
 <b><i>(\para-tithemenos\)</i></b>, quoting the Scripture to prove his<br>
 contention which was made in much conflict <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 2:2)</i></b>, probably<br>
 in the midst of heated discussion by the opposing rabbis who were<br>
 anything but convinced by Paul's powerful arguments, for the<br>
 Cross was a stumbling-block to the Jews <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 1:23)</i></b>. <B>{That it<br>
 behoved the Christ to suffer}</B> <b><i>(\hoti ton Christon edei pathein\)</i></b>.<br>
 The second aorist active infinitive is the subject of \edei\ with<br>
 \ton Christon\, the accusative of general reference. This is<br>
 Paul's major premise in his argument from the Scriptures about<br>
 the Messiah, the necessity of his sufferings according to the<br>
 Scriptures, the very argument made by the Risen Jesus to the two<br>
 on the way to Emmaus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:25-27)</i></b>. The fifty-third chapter of<br>
 Isaiah was a passage in point that the rabbis had overlooked.<br>
 Peter made the same point in <!-#-->Ac 3:18 and Paul again in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 26:23. The minor premise is the resurrection of Jesus from the<br>
 dead. <B>{To rise again from the dead}</B> <b><i>(\anast&#275;nai ek nekr&#333;n\)</i></b>. This<br>
 second aorist active infinitive \anast&#275;nai\ is also the subject<br>
 of \edei\. The actual resurrection of Jesus was also a necessity<br>
 as Paul says he preached to them <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 4:14)</i></b> and argued always<br>
 from Scripture <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:3-4)</i></b> and from his own experience <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 9:22; 22:7; 26:8,14; 1Co 15:8)</i></b>. <B>{This Jesus is the Christ}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\houtos estin ho Christos, ho I&#275;sous\)</i></b>. More precisely, "This is<br>
 the Messiah, viz., Jesus whom I am proclaiming unto you." This is<br>
 the conclusion of Paul's line of argument and it is logical and<br>
 overwhelming. It is his method everywhere as in Damascus, in<br>
 Antioch in Pisidia, here, in Corinth. He spoke as an eye-witness.<br>
 <br>
 17:4 <B>{Some of them}</B> <b><i>(\tines ex aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. That is of the Jews who<br>
 were evidently largely afraid of the rabbis. Still "some" were<br>
 persuaded <b><i>(\epeisth&#275;san\, effective first aorist passive<br>
 indicative)</i></b> and "consorted with" <b><i>(\prosekl&#275;r&#333;th&#275;san\)</i></b>. This<br>
 latter verb is also first aorist passive indicative of<br>
 \proskl&#275;ro&#333;\, a common verb in late Greek <b><i>(Plutarch, Lucian)</i></b>, but<br>
 only here in the N.T., from \pros\ and \kl&#275;ros\, to assign by<br>
 lot. So then this small group of Jews were given Paul and Silas<br>
 by God's grace. <B>{And of the devout Greeks a great multitude}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\t&#333;n te sebomen&#333;n Hell&#275;n&#333;n pl&#275;thos polu\)</i></b>. These "God-fearers"<br>
 among the Gentiles were less under the control of the jealous<br>
 rabbis and so responded more readily to Paul's appeal. In <!-#-->1Th<br>
 1:9 Paul expressly says that they had "turned to God from<br>
 idols," proof that this church was mainly Gentile <b><i>(cf. also <!-#-->1Th<br>
 2:14)</i></b>. <B>{And of the chief women not a few}</B> <b><i>(\gunaik&#333;n te t&#333;n<br>
 pr&#333;t&#333;n ouk oligai\)</i></b>. Literally, "And of women the first not a<br>
 few." That is, a large number of women of the very first rank in<br>
 the city, probably devout women also like the men just before and<br>
 like those in <!-#-->13:50 in Antioch in Pisidia who along with "the<br>
 first men of the city" were stirred up against Paul. Here these<br>
 women were openly friendly to Paul's message, whether proselytes<br>
 or Gentiles or Jewish wives of Gentiles as Hort holds. It is<br>
 noteworthy that here, as in Philippi, leading women take a bold<br>
 stand for Christ. In Macedonia women had more freedom than<br>
 elsewhere. It is not to be inferred that all those converted<br>
 belonged to the higher classes, for the industrial element was<br>
 clearly large <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 4:11)</i></b>. In <!-#-->2Co 8:2 Paul speaks of the deep<br>
 poverty of the Macedonian churches, but with Philippi mainly in<br>
 mind. Ramsay thinks that Paul won many of the heathen not<br>
 affiliated at all with the synagogue. Certain it is that we must<br>
 allow a considerable interval of time between verses <!-#-->4,5 to<br>
 understand what Paul says in his Thessalonian Epistles.<br>
 <br>
 17:5 <B>{Moved with jealousy}</B> <b><i>(\z&#275;l&#333;santes\)</i></b>. Both our English<br>
 words, <B>{zeal}</B> and <B>{jealousy}</B>, are from the Greek \z&#275;los\. In<br>
 <!-#-->13:45 the Jews <b><i>(rabbis)</i></b> "were filled with jealousy"<br>
 <b><i>(\epl&#275;sth&#275;san z&#275;lou\)</i></b>. That is another way of saying the same<br>
 thing as here. The success of Paul was entirely too great in both<br>
 places to please the rabbis. So here is jealousy of Jewish<br>
 preachers towards Christian preachers. It is always between men<br>
 or women of the same profession or group. In <!-#-->1Th 2:3-10 Paul<br>
 hints at some of the slanders spread against him by these rabbis<br>
 <b><i>(deceivers, using words of flattery as men-pleasers, after<br>
 vain-glory, greed of gain, etc.)</i></b>. <B>{Took unto them}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\proslabomenoi\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle <b><i>(indirect, to themselves)</i></b><br>
 participle of \proslamban&#333;\, old and common verb. <B>{Certain vile<br>
 fellows of the rabble}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n agorai&#333;n andras tinas pon&#275;rous\)</i></b>.<br>
 The \agora\ or market-place was the natural resort for those with<br>
 nothing to do <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 20:4)</i></b> like the court-house square today or<br>
 various parks in our cities where bench-warmers flock. Plato<br>
 <b><i>(_Protagoras_ 347 C)</i></b> calls these \agoraioi\ <b><i>(common word, but in<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->19:38)</i></b> idlers or good-for-nothing fellows.<br>
 They are in every city and such "bums" are ready for any job. The<br>
 church in Thessalonica caught some of these peripatetic idlers<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 3:10f.)</i></b> "doing nothing but doing about." So the Jewish<br>
 preachers gather to themselves a choice collection of these<br>
 market-loungers or loafers or wharf-rats. The Romans called them<br>
 _subrostrani_ <b><i>(hangers round the rostrum or _subbasilicari_)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Gathering a crowd}</B> <b><i>(\ochlopoi&#275;santes\)</i></b>. Literally, making or<br>
 getting <b><i>(\poie&#333;\)</i></b> a crowd <b><i>(\ochlos\)</i></b>, a word not found elsewhere.<br>
 Probably right in the \agora\ itself where the rabbis could tell<br>
 men their duties and pay them in advance. Instance Hyde Park in<br>
 London with all the curious gatherings every day, Sunday<br>
 afternoons in particular. <B>{Set the city on an uproar}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ethoruboun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \thorube&#333;\, from \thorubos\<br>
 <b><i>(tumult)</i></b>, old verb, but in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->20:10; Mt<br>
 9:23; Mr 4:39. They kept up the din, this combination of rabbis<br>
 and rabble. <B>{Assaulting the house of Jason}</B> <b><i>(\epistantes t&#275;i<br>
 oiki&#257;i Iasonos\)</i></b>. Second aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active of<br>
 \ephist&#275;mi\, taking a stand against, rushing at, because he was<br>
 Paul's host. He may have been a Gentile <b><i>(Jason the name of an<br>
 ancient king of Thessaly)</i></b>, but the Jews often used it for Joshua<br>
 or Jesus <b><i>(II Macc. 1:7)</i></b>. <B>{They sought}</B> <b><i>(\ez&#275;toun\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active. They burst into the house and searched up and down.<br>
 <B>{Them}</B> <b><i>(\autous\)</i></b>. Paul and Silas. They were getting ready to<br>
 have a lynching party.<br>
 <br>
 17:6 <B>{When they found them not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; heurontes\)</i></b>. Usual negative<br>
 \m&#275;\ with the participle in the _Koin&#275;_, second aorist<br>
 <b><i>(effective)</i></b> active participle, complete failure with all the<br>
 noise and "bums." <B>{They dragged}</B> <b><i>(\esuron\)</i></b>. Imperfect active,<br>
 vivid picture, they were dragging <b><i>(literally)</i></b>. See already <!-#-->8:3;<br>
 16:19. If they could not find Paul, they could drag Jason his<br>
 host and some other Christians whom we do not know. <B>{Before the<br>
 rulers of the city}</B> <b><i>(\epi tous politarchas\)</i></b>. This word does not<br>
 occur in Greek literature and used to be cited as an example of<br>
 Luke's blunders. But now it is found in an inscription on an arch<br>
 in the modern city preserved in the British Museum. It is also<br>
 found in seventeen inscriptions <b><i>(five from Thessalonica)</i></b> where<br>
 the word or the verb \politarche&#333;\ occurs. It is a fine<br>
 illustration of the historical accuracy of Luke in matters of<br>
 detail. This title for city officers in Thessalonica, a free<br>
 city, is correct. They were burgomasters or "rulers of the city."<br>
 <B>{Crying}</B> <b><i>(\bo&#333;ntes\)</i></b>. Yelling as if the house was on fire like<br>
 the mob in Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->21:28)</i></b>. <B>{These that have turned the world<br>
 upside down}</B> <b><i>(\hoi t&#275;n oikoumen&#275;n anastat&#333;santes\)</i></b>. The use of<br>
 \oikoumen&#275;n\ <b><i>(supply \gen\ or \ch&#333;ran\, the inhabited earth,<br>
 present passive participle of \oike&#333;\)</i></b> means the Roman Empire,<br>
 since it is a political charge, a natural hyperbole in their<br>
 excitement, but the phrase occurs for the Roman Empire in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 2:1. It is possible that news had come to Thessalonica of the<br>
 expulsion of the Jews from Rome by Claudius. There is truth in<br>
 the accusation, for Christianity is revolutionary, but on this<br>
 particular occasion the uproar <b><i>(verse <!-#-->5)</i></b> was created by the<br>
 rabbis and the hired loafers. The verb \anastato&#333;\ <b><i>(here first<br>
 aorist active participle)</i></b> does not occur in the ancient writers,<br>
 but is in LXX and in <!-#-->Ac 17:6; 21:38; Ga 5:12. It occurs also in<br>
 Harpocration <b><i>(A.D. 4th cent.)</i></b> and about 100 B.C. \exanastato&#333;\ is<br>
 found in a fragment of papyrus <b><i>(Tebtunis no. 2)</i></b> and in a Paris<br>
 Magical Papyrus l. 2243f. But in an Egyptian letter of Aug. 4, 41<br>
 A.D. <b><i>(Oxyrhynchus Pap. no. 119, 10)</i></b> "the bad boy" uses it = "he<br>
 upsets me" or " he drives me out of my senses" <b><i>(\anastatoi me\)</i></b>.<br>
 See Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient East_, pp. 84f. It is not<br>
 a "Biblical word" at all, but belongs to the current _Koin&#275;_. It<br>
 is a vigorous and graphic term.<br>
 <br>
 17:7 <B>{Whom Jason hath received}</B> <b><i>(\hous hupodedektai Ias&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present perfect middle indicative of \hupodechomai\, to<br>
 entertain, old verb, but in N.T. only in <!-#-->Lu 10:38; 19:6; Ac<br>
 17:7; Jas 2:25. This is Jason's crime and he is the prisoner<br>
 before the politarchs. <B>{These all}</B> <b><i>(\houtoi pantes\)</i></b>. Jason, the<br>
 "brethren" of verse <!-#-->6, Paul and Silas, and all Christians<br>
 everywhere. <B>{Contrary}</B> <b><i>(\apenanti\)</i></b>. Late compound preposition<br>
 <b><i>(\apo, en, anti\)</i></b> found in Polybius, LXX, here only in the N.T.<br>
 <B>{The decrees of Caesar}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n dogmat&#333;n Kaisaros\)</i></b>. This was a<br>
 charge of treason and was a sure way to get a conviction.<br>
 Probably the Julian _Leges Majestatis_ are in mind rather than<br>
 the definite decree of Claudius about the Jews <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:2)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Saying that there is another king, one Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\Basilea heteron<br>
 legontes einai I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. Note the very order of the words in the<br>
 Greek indirect discourse with the accusative and infinitive after<br>
 \legontes\. \Basilea heteron\ comes first, a different king,<br>
 another emperor than Caesar. This was the very charge that the<br>
 smart student of the Pharisees and Herodians had tried to catch<br>
 Jesus on <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 12:14)</i></b>. The Sanhedrin made it anyhow against Jesus<br>
 to Pilate <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 23:2)</i></b> and Pilate had to notice it. "Although the<br>
 emperors never ventured to assume the title _rex_ at Rome, in the<br>
 Eastern provinces they were regularly termed _basileus_" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>.<br>
 The Jews here, as before Pilate <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 19:15)</i></b>, renounce their<br>
 dearest hope of a Messianic king. It is plain that Paul had<br>
 preached about Jesus as the Messiah, King of the Kingdom of God<br>
 over against the Roman Empire, a spiritual kingdom, to be sure,<br>
 but the Jews here turn his language to his hurt as they did with<br>
 Jesus. As a matter of fact Paul's preaching about the kingdom and<br>
 the second coming of Christ was gravely misunderstood by the<br>
 Christians at Thessalonica after his departure <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 4:13-5:4;<br>
 2Th 2)</i></b>. The Jews were quick to seize upon his language about<br>
 Jesus Christ to his own injury. Clearly here in Thessalonica Paul<br>
 had faced the power of the Roman Empire in a new way and pictured<br>
 over against it the grandeur of the reign of Christ.<br>
 <br>
 17:8 <B>{They troubled the multitude and the rulers}</B> <b><i>(\etaraxan ton<br>
 ochlon kai tous politarchas\)</i></b>. First aorist active of \tarass&#333;\,<br>
 old verb to agitate. The excitement of the multitude "agitated"<br>
 the politarchs still more. To the people it meant a revolution,<br>
 to the politarchs a charge of complicity in treason if they let<br>
 it pass. They had no way to disprove the charge of treason and<br>
 Paul and Silas were not present.<br>
 <br>
 17:9 <B>{When they had taken security}</B> <b><i>(\labontes to hikanon\)</i></b>. A<br>
 Greek idiom=Latin _satis accipere_, to receive the sufficient<br>
 <b><i>(bond)</i></b>, usually money for the fulfilment of the judgment.<br>
 Probably the demand was made of Jason that he see to it that Paul<br>
 and Silas leave the city not to return. In <!-#-->1Th 2:17f. Paul may<br>
 refer to this in mentioning his inability to visit these<br>
 Thessalonians again. The idiom \lambanein to hikanon\ now is<br>
 found in two inscriptions of the second century A.D. <b><i>(O. G. I. S.<br>
 484, 50 and 629, 101)</i></b>. In Vol. III Oxyrhynchus Papyri no. 294<br>
 A.D. 22 the corresponding phrase \dounai heikanon\ <b><i>("to give<br>
 security")</i></b> appears. <B>{They let them go}</B> <b><i>(\apelusan autous\)</i></b>. The<br>
 charge was serious but the proof slim so that the politarchs were<br>
 glad to be rid of the case.<br>
 <br>
 17:10 <B>{Immediately by night}</B> <b><i>(\euthe&#333;s dia nuktos\)</i></b>. Paul's work<br>
 had not been in vain in Thessalonica <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 1:7f.; 2:13,20)</i></b>. Paul<br>
 loved the church here. Two of them, Aristarchus and Secundus,<br>
 will accompany him to Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:4)</i></b> and Aristarchus will<br>
 go on with him to Rome <b><i>(<!-#-->27:2)</i></b>. Plainly Paul and Silas had been<br>
 in hiding in Thessalonica and in real danger. After his departure<br>
 severe persecution came to the Christians in Thessalonica <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th<br>
 2:14; 3:1-5; 2Th 1:6)</i></b>. It is possible that there was an escort<br>
 of Gentile converts with Paul and Silas on this night journey to<br>
 Beroea which was about fifty miles southwest from Thessalonica<br>
 near Pella in another district of Macedonia <b><i>(Emathia)</i></b>. There is a<br>
 modern town there of some 6,000 people. <B>{Went}</B> <b><i>(\ap&#275;iesan\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect third plural active of \apeimi\, old verb to go away,<br>
 here alone in the N.T. A literary, almost Atticistic, form<br>
 instead of \ap&#275;lthon\. <B>{Into the synagogue of the Jews}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n<br>
 sunag&#333;g&#275;n t&#333;n Ioudai&#333;n\)</i></b>. Paul's usual custom and he lost no time<br>
 about it. Enough Jews here to have a synagogue.<br>
 <br>
 17:11 <B>{More noble than those}</B> <b><i>(\eugenesteroi t&#333;n\)</i></b>. Comparative<br>
 form of \eugen&#275;s\, old and common adjective, but in N.T. only<br>
 here and <!-#-->Lu 19:12; 1Co 1:26. Followed by ablative case \t&#333;n\ as<br>
 often after the comparative. <B>{With all readiness of mind}</B> <b><i>(\meta<br>
 p&#257;s&#275;s prothumias\)</i></b>. Old word from \prothumos\ <b><i>(\pro, thumos\)</i></b> and<br>
 means eagerness, rushing forward. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->2Co<br>
 8:11-19; 9:2. In Thessalonica many of the Jews out of pride and<br>
 prejudice refused to listen. Here the Jews joyfully welcomed the<br>
 two Jewish visitors. <B>{Examining the Scriptures daily}</B> <b><i>(\kath'<br>
 h&#275;meran anakrinontes tas graphas\)</i></b>. Paul expounded the Scriptures<br>
 daily as in Thessalonica, but the Beroeans, instead of resenting<br>
 his new interpretation, examined <b><i>(\anakrin&#333;\ means to sift up and<br>
 down, make careful and exact research as in legal processes as in<br>
 <!-#-->Ac 4:9; 12:19, etc.)</i></b> the Scriptures for themselves. In Scotland<br>
 people have the Bible open on the preacher as he expounds the<br>
 passage, a fine habit worth imitating. <B>{Whether these things were<br>
 so}</B> <b><i>(\ei echoi tauta hout&#333;s\)</i></b>. Literally, "if these things had it<br>
 thus." The present optative in the indirect question represents<br>
 an original present indicative as in <!-#-->Lu 1:29 <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, pp. 1043f.)</i></b>. This use of \ei\ with the optative may be<br>
 looked at as the condition of the fourth class <b><i>(undetermined with<br>
 less likelihood of determination)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Ac 17:27; 20:16; 24:19;<br>
 27:12 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1021)</i></b>. The Beroeans were eagerly<br>
 interested in the new message of Paul and Silas but they wanted<br>
 to see it for themselves. What a noble attitude. Paul's preaching<br>
 made Bible students of them. The duty of private interpretation<br>
 is thus made plain <b><i>(Hovey)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:12 <B>{Many therefore}</B> <b><i>(\Polloi men oun\)</i></b>. As a result of this<br>
 Bible study. <B>{Also of the Greek women of honourable estate}</B>. The<br>
 word \Hell&#275;nis\ means Greek woman, but the word \gun&#275;\ is added.<br>
 In particular women of rank <b><i>(\eusch&#275;mon&#333;n\, from \eu\ and \ech&#333;\,<br>
 graceful figure and the honourable standing)</i></b> as in <!-#-->13:50 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 15:43)</i></b>. Probably Luke means by implication that the "men"<br>
 <b><i>(\andr&#333;n\)</i></b> were also noble Greeks though he does not expressly<br>
 say so. So then the Jews were more open to the message, the<br>
 proselytes or God-fearers followed suit, with "not a few" <b><i>(\ouk<br>
 oligoi\)</i></b> real Greeks <b><i>(both men and women)</i></b> believing. It was quick<br>
 and fine work.<br>
 <br>
 17:13 <B>{Was proclaimed}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;ggel&#275;\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive<br>
 indicative of \kataggell&#333;\, common late verb as in <!-#-->Ac 16:21.<br>
 <B>{Of Paul}</B> <b><i>(\hupo Paulou\)</i></b>. By Paul, of course. <B>{Stirring up and<br>
 troubling the multitudes}</B> <b><i>(\saleuontes kai tarassontes tous<br>
 ochlous\)</i></b>. Shaking the crowds like an earthquake <b><i>(<!-#-->4:31)</i></b> and<br>
 disturbing like a tornado <b><i>(<!-#-->17:8)</i></b>. Success at Thessalonica gave<br>
 the rabbis confidence and courage. The attack was sharp and<br>
 swift. The Jews from Antioch in Pisidia had likewise pursued Paul<br>
 to Iconium and Lystra. How long Paul had been in Beroea Luke does<br>
 not say. But a church was established here which gave a good<br>
 account of itself later and sent a messenger <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:4)</i></b> with<br>
 their part of the collection to Jerusalem. This quiet and noble<br>
 town was in a whirl of excitement over the attacks of the Jewish<br>
 emissaries from Thessalonica who probably made the same charge of<br>
 treason against Paul and Silas.<br>
 <br>
 17:14 <B>{And then immediately}</B> <b><i>(\euthe&#333;s de tote\)</i></b>. They acted<br>
 swiftly as in Thessalonica. <B>{Sent forth}</B> <b><i>(\exapesteilan\)</i></b>. Double<br>
 compound <b><i>(\ex, apo\, both out and away)</i></b> common in late Greek.<br>
 First aorist active indicative <b><i>(\exapostell&#333;\, liquid verb)</i></b>. Same<br>
 form in <!-#-->9:30. <B>{As far as to the sea}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s epi t&#275;n<br>
 thalassan\)</i></b>. It is not clear whether Paul went all the way to<br>
 Athens by land or took ship at Dium or Pydna, some sixteen miles<br>
 away, and sailed to Athens. Some even think that Paul gave the<br>
 Jews the slip and went all the way by land when they expected him<br>
 to go by sea. At any rate we know that Paul was grieved to cut<br>
 short his work in Macedonia, probably not over six months in all,<br>
 which had been so fruitful in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Beroea.<br>
 Silas and Timothy <b><i>(note his presence)</i></b> remained behind in Beroea<br>
 and they would keep the work going. Paul no doubt hoped to return<br>
 soon. Silas and Timothy in Beroea would also serve to screen his<br>
 flight for the Jews wanted his blood, not theirs. The work in<br>
 Macedonia spread widely <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 1:7f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:15 <B>{But they that conducted Paul}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de kathistanontes ton<br>
 Paulon\)</i></b>. Articular present active participle of \kathistan&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(late form in A B of \kathist&#275;mi\ or \kathista&#333;\)</i></b>, an old verb<br>
 with varied uses to put down, to constitute, to conduct, etc.<br>
 This use here is in the LXX <b><i>(<!-#-->Jos 6:23)</i></b> and old Greek also. <B>{To<br>
 Athens}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s Ath&#275;n&#333;n\)</i></b>. To make sure of his safe arrival. <B>{That<br>
 they should come to him with all speed}</B> <b><i>(\hina h&#333;s tachista<br>
 elth&#333;sin pros auton\)</i></b>. Note the neat Greek idiom \h&#333;s tachista\<br>
 as quickly as possible <b><i>(good Attic idiom)</i></b>. The indirect command<br>
 and purpose <b><i>(\hina-elth&#333;sin\, second aorist active subjunctive)</i></b><br>
 is also neat Greek <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1046)</i></b>. <B>{Departed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ex&#275;iesan\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \exeimi\, old Greek word, but<br>
 rare in N.T. All in Acts <b><i>(<!-#-->13:42; 17:15; 20:7; 27:43)</i></b><br>
 <br>
 17:16 <B>{Now while Paul waited for them in Athens}</B> <b><i>(\En de tais<br>
 Ath&#275;nais ekdechomenou autous tou Paulou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute with<br>
 present middle participle of \ekdechomai\, old verb to receive,<br>
 but only with the sense of looking out for, expecting found here<br>
 and elsewhere in N.T We know that Timothy did come to Paul in<br>
 Athens <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 3:1,6)</i></b> from Thessalonica and was sent back to them<br>
 from Athens. If Silas also came to Athens, he was also sent away,<br>
 possibly to Philippi, for that church was deeply interested in<br>
 Paul. At any rate both Timothy and Silas came from Macedonia to<br>
 Corinth with messages and relief for Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:5; 2Co<br>
 11:8f.)</i></b>. Before they came and after they left, Paul felt lonely<br>
 in Athens <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 3:1)</i></b>, the first time on this tour or the first<br>
 that he has been completely without fellow workers. Athens had<br>
 been captured by Sulla B.C. 86. After various changes Achaia, of<br>
 which Corinth is the capital, is a separate province from<br>
 Macedonia and A.D. 44 was restored by Claudius to the Senate with<br>
 the Proconsul at Corinth. Paul is probably here about A.D. 50.<br>
 Politically Athens is no longer of importance when Paul comes<br>
 though it is still the university seat of the world with all its<br>
 rich environment and traditions. Rackham grows eloquent over Paul<br>
 the Jew of Tarsus being in the city of Pericles and Demosthenes,<br>
 Socrates and Plato and Aristotle, Sophocles and Euripides. In its<br>
 Agora Socrates had taught, here was the Academy of Plato, the<br>
 Lyceum of Aristotle, the Porch of Zeno, the Garden of Epicurus.<br>
 Here men still talked about philosophy, poetry, politics,<br>
 religion, anything and everything. It was the art centre of the<br>
 world. The Parthenon, the most beautiful of temples, crowned the<br>
 Acropolis. Was Paul insensible to all this cultural environment?<br>
 It is hard to think so for he was a university man of Tarsus and<br>
 he makes a number of allusions to Greek writers. Probably it had<br>
 not been in Paul's original plan to evangelize Athens, difficult<br>
 as all university seats are, but he cannot be idle though here<br>
 apparently by chance because driven out of Macedonia. <B>{Was<br>
 provoked}</B> <b><i>(\par&#333;xuneto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive of \paroxun&#333;\, old<br>
 verb to sharpen, to stimulate, to irritate <b><i>(from \para, oxus\)</i></b>,<br>
 from \paroxusmos\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:39)</i></b>, common in old Greek, but in N.T.<br>
 only here and <!-#-->1Co 13:5. It was a continual challenge to Paul's<br>
 spirit when he beheld <b><i>(\the&#333;rountos\, genitive of present<br>
 participle agreeing with \autou\ <b><i>(his)</i></b>, though late MSS. have<br>
 locative \the&#333;rounti\ agreeing with \en aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. <B>{The city full<br>
 of idols}</B> <b><i>(\kateid&#333;lon ousan t&#275;n polin\)</i></b>. Note the participle<br>
 \ousan\ not preserved in the English <b><i>(either the city being full<br>
 of idols or that the city was full of idols, sort of indirect<br>
 discourse)</i></b>. Paul, like any stranger was looking at the sights as<br>
 he walked around. This adjective \kateid&#333;lon\ <b><i>(perfective use of<br>
 \kata\ and \eid&#333;lon\ is found nowhere else, but it is formed<br>
 after the analogy of \katampelos, katadendron\)</i></b>, full of idols.<br>
 Xenophon <b><i>(_de Republ. Ath_.)</i></b> calls the city \hol&#275; bomos, hol&#275;<br>
 thuma theois kai anath&#275;ma\ <b><i>(all altar, all sacrifice and offering<br>
 to the gods)</i></b>. These statues were beautiful, but Paul was not<br>
 deceived by the mere art for art's sake. The idolatry and<br>
 sensualism of it all glared at him <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:18-32)</i></b>. Renan<br>
 ridicules Paul's ignorance in taking these statues for idols, but<br>
 Paul knew paganism better than Renan. The superstition of this<br>
 centre of Greek culture was depressing to Paul. One has only to<br>
 recall how superstitious cults today flourish in the atmosphere<br>
 of Boston and Los Angeles to understand conditions in Athens.<br>
 Pausanias says that Athens had more images than all the rest of<br>
 Greece put together. Pliny states that in the time of Nero Athens<br>
 had over 30,000 public statues besides countless private ones in<br>
 the homes. Petronius sneers that it was easier to find a god than<br>
 a man in Athens. Every gateway or porch had its protecting god.<br>
 They lined the street from the Piraeus and caught the eye at<br>
 every place of prominence on wall or in the agora.<br>
 <br>
 17:17 <B>{So he reasoned}</B> <b><i>(\dielegeto men oun\)</i></b>. Accordingly<br>
 therefore, with his spirit stirred by the proof of idolatry.<br>
 Imperfect middle of \dialeg&#333;\, same verb used in verse <!-#-->2 which<br>
 see. First he reasoned in the synagogue at the services to the<br>
 Jews and the God-fearers, then daily in the agora or marketplace<br>
 <b><i>(southwest of the Acropolis, between it and the Areopagus and the<br>
 Pnyx)</i></b> to the chance-comers, "them that met him" <b><i>(\pros tous<br>
 paratugchanontas\)</i></b>. Simultaneously with the synagogue preaching<br>
 at other hours Paul took his stand like Socrates before him and<br>
 engaged in conversation with <b><i>(\pros\)</i></b> those who happened by. This<br>
 old verb, \paratugchan&#333;\, occurs here alone in the N.T. and<br>
 accurately pictures the life in the agora. The listeners to Paul<br>
 in the agora would be more casual than those who stop for street<br>
 preaching, a Salvation Army meeting, a harangue from a box in<br>
 Hyde Park. It was a slim chance either in synagogue or in agora,<br>
 but Paul could not remain still with all the reeking idolatry<br>
 around him. The boundaries of the agora varied, but there was<br>
 always the \Poikil&#275; Stoa\ <b><i>(the Painted Porch)</i></b>, over against the<br>
 Acropolis on the west. In this \Stoa\ <b><i>(Porch)</i></b> Zeno and other<br>
 philosophers and rhetoricians held forth from time to time. Paul<br>
 may have stood near this spot.<br>
 <br>
 17:18 <B>{And certain also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers<br>
 encountered him}</B> <b><i>(\tines de kai t&#333;n Epikouri&#333;n kai St&#333;ik&#333;n<br>
 philosoph&#333;n suneballon aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \sunball&#333;\,<br>
 old verb, in the N.T. only by Luke, to bring or put together in<br>
 one's mind <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:19)</i></b>, to meet together <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:14)</i></b>, to bring<br>
 together aid <b><i>(<!-#-->18:27)</i></b>, to confer or converse or dispute as here<br>
 and already <!-#-->4:15 which see. These professional philosophers<br>
 were always ready for an argument and so they frequented the<br>
 agora for that purpose. Luke uses one article and so groups the<br>
 two sects together in their attitude toward Paul, but they were<br>
 very different in fact. Both sects were eager for argument and<br>
 both had disdain for Paul, but they were the two rival practical<br>
 philosophies of the day, succeeding the more abstruse theories of<br>
 Plato and Aristotle. Socrates had turned men's thought inward<br>
 <b><i>(\Gn&#333;thi Seauton\, Know Thyself)</i></b> away from the mere study of<br>
 physics. Plato followed with a profound development of the inner<br>
 self <b><i>(metaphysics)</i></b>. Aristotle with his cyclopaedic grasp sought<br>
 to unify and relate both physics and metaphysics. Both Zeno and<br>
 Epicurus <b><i>(340-272 B.C.)</i></b> took a more practical turn in all this<br>
 intellectual turmoil and raised the issues of everyday life. Zeno<br>
 <b><i>(360-260 B.C.)</i></b> taught in the \Stoa\ <b><i>(Porch)</i></b> and so his teaching<br>
 was called Stoicism. He advanced many noble ideas that found<br>
 their chief illustration in the Roman philosophers <b><i>(Seneca,<br>
 Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius)</i></b>. He taught self-mastery and hardness<br>
 with an austerity that ministered to pride or suicide in case of<br>
 failure, a distinctly selfish and unloving view of life and with<br>
 a pantheistic philosophy. Epicurus considered practical atheism<br>
 the true view of the universe and denied a future life and<br>
 claimed pleasure as the chief thing to be gotten out of life. He<br>
 did not deny the existence of gods, but regarded them as<br>
 unconcerned with the life of men. The Stoics called Epicurus an<br>
 atheist. Lucretius and Horace give the Epicurean view of life in<br>
 their great poems. This low view of life led to sensualism and<br>
 does today, for both Stoicism and Epicureanism are widely<br>
 influential with people now. "Eat and drink for tomorrow we die,"<br>
 they preached. Paul had doubtless become acquainted with both of<br>
 these philosophies for they were widely prevalent over the world.<br>
 Here he confronts them in their very home. He is challenged by<br>
 past-masters in the art of appealing to the senses, men as<br>
 skilled in their dialectic as the Pharisaic rabbis with whom Paul<br>
 had been trained and whose subtleties he had learned how to<br>
 expose. But, so far as we know, this is a new experience for Paul<br>
 to have a public dispute with these philosophical experts who had<br>
 a natural contempt for all Jews and for rabbis in particular,<br>
 though they found Paul a new type at any rate and so with some<br>
 interest in him. "In Epicureanism, it was man's sensual nature<br>
 which arrayed itself against the claims of the gospel; in<br>
 Stoicism it was his self-righteousness and pride of intellect"<br>
 <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>. Knowling calls the Stoic the Pharisee of philosophy<br>
 and the Epicurean the Sadducee of philosophy. Socrates in this<br>
 very agora used to try to interest the passers-by in some desire<br>
 for better things. That was 450 years before Paul is challenged<br>
 by these superficial sophistical Epicureans and Stoics. It is<br>
 doubtful if Paul had ever met a more difficult situation. <B>{What<br>
 would this babbler say?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti an theloi ho spermologos houtos<br>
 legein?\)</i></b>. The word for "babbler" means "seed-picker" or picker<br>
 up of seeds <b><i>(\sperma\, seed, \leg&#333;\, to collect)</i></b> like a bird in<br>
 the agora hopping about after chance seeds. Plutarch applies the<br>
 word to crows that pick up grain in the fields. Demosthenes<br>
 called Aeschines a \spermologos\. Eustathius uses it of a man<br>
 hanging around in the markets picking up scraps of food that fell<br>
 from the carts and so also of mere rhetoricians and plagiarists<br>
 who picked up scraps of wisdom from others. Ramsay considers it<br>
 here a piece of Athenian slang used to describe the picture of<br>
 Paul seen by these philosophers who use it, for not all of them<br>
 had it <b><i>("some," \tines\)</i></b>. Note the use of \an\ and the present<br>
 active optative \theloi\, conclusion of a fourth-class condition<br>
 in a rhetorical question <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1021)</i></b>. It<br>
 means, What would this picker up of seeds wish to say, if he<br>
 should get off an idea? It is a contemptuous tone of supreme<br>
 ridicule and doubtless Paul heard this comment. Probably the<br>
 Epicureans made this sneer that Paul was a charlatan or quack.<br>
 <B>{Other some}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de\)</i></b>. But others, in contrast with the "some"<br>
 just before. Perhaps the Stoics take this more serious view of<br>
 Paul. <B>{He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods}</B> <b><i>(\zen&#333;n<br>
 daimoni&#333;n dokei kataggeleus einai\)</i></b>. This view is put cautiously<br>
 by \dokei\ <b><i>(seems)</i></b>. \Kataggeleus\ does not occur in the old<br>
 Greek, though in ecclesiastical writers, but Deissmann <b><i>(_Light<br>
 from the Ancient East_, p. 99)</i></b> gives an example of the word "on a<br>
 marble stele recording a decree of the Mitylenaens in honour of<br>
 the Emperor Augustus," where it is the herald of the games. Here<br>
 alone in the N.T. \Daimonion\ is used in the old Greek sense of<br>
 deity or divinity whether good or bad, not in the N.T. sense of<br>
 demons. Both this word and \kataggeleus\ are used from the<br>
 Athenian standpoint. \Xenos\ is an old word for a guest-friend<br>
 <b><i>(Latin _hospes_)</i></b> and then host <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 16:23)</i></b>, then for foreigner<br>
 or stranger <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 25:31; Ac 17:21)</i></b>, new and so strange as here<br>
 and <!-#-->Heb 13:9; 1Pe 4:12, and then aliens <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph 2:12)</i></b>. This view<br>
 of Paul is the first count against Socrates: Socrates does wrong,<br>
 introducing new deities <b><i>(\adikei S&#333;krat&#275;s, kaina daimonia<br>
 eispher&#333;n\, Xen. _Mem_. I)</i></b>. On this charge the Athenians voted<br>
 the hemlock for their greatest citizen. What will they do to<br>
 Paul? This Athens was more sceptical and more tolerant than the<br>
 old Athens. But Roman law did not allow the introduction of a new<br>
 religion <b><i>(_religio illicita_)</i></b>. Paul was walking on thin ice<br>
 though he was the real master philosopher and these Epicureans<br>
 and Stoics were quacks. Paul had the only true philosophy of the<br>
 universe and life with Jesus Christ as the centre <b><i>(<!-#-->Col<br>
 1:12-20)</i></b>, the greatest of all philosophers as Ramsay justly<br>
 terms him. But these men are mocking him. <B>{Because he preached<br>
 Jesus and the resurrection}</B> <b><i>(\hoti ton I&#275;soun kai t&#275;n anastasin<br>
 eu&#275;ggelizato\)</i></b>. Reason for the view just stated. Imperfect middle<br>
 indicative of \euaggeliz&#333;\, to "gospelize." Apparently these<br>
 critics considered \anastasis\ <b><i>(Resurrection)</i></b> another deity on a<br>
 par with Jesus. The Athenians worshipped all sorts of abstract<br>
 truths and virtues and they misunderstood Paul on this subject.<br>
 They will leave him as soon as he mentions the resurrection<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->32)</i></b>. It is objected that Luke would not use the word in<br>
 this sense here for his readers would not under stand him. But<br>
 Luke is describing the misapprehension of this group of<br>
 philosophers and this interpretation fits in precisely.<br>
 <br>
 17:19 <B>{And they took hold of him}</B> <b><i>(\epilabomenoi de autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Second aorist middle participle of \epilamban&#333;\, old verb, but in<br>
 the N.T. only in the middle, here with the genitive \autou\ to<br>
 lay hold of, but with no necessary sense of violence <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 9:27;<br>
 23:27; Mr 8:23)</i></b>, unless the idea is that Paul was to be tried<br>
 before the Court of Areopagus for the crime of bringing in<br>
 strange gods. But the day for that had passed in Athens. Even so<br>
 it is not clear whether "<B>{unto the Areopagus}</B> <b><i>(\epi ton Areion<br>
 Pagon\")</i></b> means the Hill of Mars <b><i>(west of the Acropolis, north of<br>
 the agora and reached by a flight of steps in the rock)</i></b> or the<br>
 court itself which met elsewhere as well as on the hills, usually<br>
 in fact in the Stoa Basilica opening on the agora and near to the<br>
 place where the dispute had gone on. Raphael's cartoon with Paul<br>
 standing on Mars Hill has made us all familiar with the common<br>
 view, but it is quite uncertain if it is true. There was not room<br>
 on the summit for a large gathering. If Paul was brought before<br>
 the Court of Areopagus <b><i>(commonly called the Areopagus as here)</i></b>,<br>
 it was not for trial as a criminal, but simply for examination<br>
 concerning his new teaching in this university city whether it<br>
 was strictly legal or not. Paul was really engaged in proselytism<br>
 to turn the Athenians away from their old gods to Jesus Christ.<br>
 But "the court of refined and polished Athenians was very<br>
 different from the rough provincial magistrates of Philippi, and<br>
 the philosophers who presented Paul to their cognizance very<br>
 different from the mob of Thessalonians" <b><i>(Rackham)</i></b>. It was all<br>
 very polite. <B>{May we know?}</B> <b><i>(\Dunametha gn&#333;nai\)</i></b>. Can we come to<br>
 know <b><i>(ingressive second aorist active infinitive)</i></b>. <B>{This new<br>
 teaching}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; kain&#275; haut&#275; didach&#275;\)</i></b>. On the position of \haut&#275;\<br>
 see Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 700f. The question was prompted by<br>
 courtesy, sarcasm, or irony. Evidently no definite charge was<br>
 laid against Paul.<br>
 <br>
 17:20 <B>{For thou bringest certain strange things}</B> <b><i>(\xenizonta gar<br>
 tina eisphereis\)</i></b>. The very verb used by Xenophon <b><i>(_Mem_. I)</i></b><br>
 about Socrates. \Xenizonta\ is present active neuter plural<br>
 participle of \xeniz&#333;\ and from \xenos\ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->18)</i></b>, "things<br>
 surprising or shocking us." <B>{We would know therefore}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\boulometha oun gn&#333;nai\)</i></b>. Very polite still, we wish or desire,<br>
 and repeating \gn&#333;nai\ <b><i>(the essential point)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:21 <B>{Spent their time}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;ukairoun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of<br>
 \eukaire&#333;\. A late word to have opportunity <b><i>(\eu, kairos\)</i></b> from<br>
 Polybius on. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mr 6:31. They had time<br>
 for,.etc. This verse is an explanatory parenthesis by Luke. <B>{Some<br>
 new thing}</B> <b><i>(\ti kainoteron\)</i></b>. Literally "something newer" or<br>
 "fresher" than the new, the very latest, the comparative of<br>
 \kainos\. Demosthenes <b><i>(_Philipp_. 1. 43)</i></b> pictures the Athenians<br>
 "in the agora inquiring if anything newer is said"<br>
 <b><i>(\punthanomenoi kata t&#275;n agoran ei ti legetai ne&#333;teron\)</i></b>. The new<br>
 soon became stale with these itching and frivolous Athenians.<br>
 <br>
 17:22 <B>{Stood in the midst of the Areopagus}</B> <b><i>(\statheis en mes&#333;i<br>
 tou Areiou Pagou\)</i></b>. First aorist passive of \hist&#275;mi\ used of<br>
 Peter in <!-#-->2:14. Majestic figure whether on Mars Hill or in the<br>
 Stoa Basilica before the Areopagus Court. There would be a crowd<br>
 of spectators and philosophers in either case and Paul seized the<br>
 opportunity to preach Christ to this strange audience as he did<br>
 in Caesarea before Herod Agrippa and the crowd of prominent<br>
 people gathered by Festus for the entertainment. Paul does not<br>
 speak as a man on trial, but as one trying to get a hearing for<br>
 the gospel of Christ. <B>{Somewhat superstitious}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s<br>
 deisidaimonesterous\)</i></b>. The Authorized Version has "too<br>
 superstitious," the American Standard "very religious."<br>
 \Deisidaim&#333;n\ is a neutral word <b><i>(from \deid&#333;\, to fear, and<br>
 \daim&#333;n\, deity)</i></b>. The Greeks used it either in the good sense of<br>
 pious or religious or the bad sense of superstitious. Thayer<br>
 suggests that Paul uses it "with kindly ambiguity." Page thinks<br>
 that Luke uses the word to represent the religious feeling of the<br>
 Athenians <b><i>(_religiosus_)</i></b> which bordered on superstition. The<br>
 Vulgate has _superstitiosiores_. In <!-#-->25:19 Festus uses the term<br>
 \deisidaimonia\ for "religion." It seems unlikely that Paul<br>
 should give this audience a slap in the face at the very start.<br>
 The way one takes this adjective here colours Paul's whole speech<br>
 before the Council of Areopagus. The comparative here as in verse<br>
 <!-#-->21 means more religions than usual <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp.<br>
 664f.)</i></b>, the object of the comparison not being expressed. The<br>
 Athenians had a tremendous reputation for their devotion to<br>
 religion, "full of idols" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->16)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:23 <B>{For}</B> <b><i>(\gar\)</i></b>. Paul gives an illustration of their<br>
 religiousness from his own experiences in their city. <B>{The<br>
 objects of your worship}</B> <b><i>(\ta sebasmata hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Late word from<br>
 \sebazomai\, to worship. In N T. only here and <!-#-->2Th 2:4. The use<br>
 of this word for temples, altars, statues, shows the conciliatory<br>
 tone in the use of \deisidaimonesterous\ in verse <!-#-->22. <B>{An<br>
 altar}</B> <b><i>(\b&#333;mon\)</i></b>. Old word, only here in the N.T. and the only<br>
 mention of a heathen altar in the N.T <B>{With this inscription}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\en h&#333;i epegegrapto\)</i></b>. On which had been written <b><i>(stood<br>
 written)</i></b>, past perfect passive indicative of \epigraph&#333;\, old and<br>
 common verb for writing on inscriptions <b><i>(\epigraph&#275;\, <!-#-->Lu<br>
 23:38)</i></b>. <B>{To an Unknown God}</B> <b><i>(\AGNOSTO THEO\)</i></b>. Dative case,<br>
 dedicated to. Pausanias <b><i>(I. 1, 4)</i></b> says that in Athens there are<br>
 "altars to gods unknown" <b><i>(\b&#333;moi the&#333;n agn&#333;st&#333;n\)</i></b>. Epimenides in<br>
 a pestilence advised the sacrifice of a sheep to the befitting<br>
 god whoever he might be. If an altar was dedicated to the wrong<br>
 deity, the Athenians feared the anger of the other gods. The only<br>
 use in the N.T. of \agn&#333;stos\, old and common adjective <b><i>(from \a\<br>
 privative and \gn&#333;stos\ verbal of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\, to know)</i></b>. Our word<br>
 agnostic comes from it. Here it has an ambiguous meaning, but<br>
 Paul uses it though to a stern Christian philosopher it may be<br>
 the "confession at once of a bastard philosophy and of a bastard<br>
 religion" <b><i>(Hort, _Hulsean Lectures_, p. 64)</i></b>. Paul was quick to<br>
 use this confession on the part of the Athenians of a higher<br>
 power than yet known to them. So he gets his theme from this<br>
 evidence of a deeper religious sense in them and makes a most<br>
 clever use of it with consummate skill. <B>{In ignorance}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\agnoountes\)</i></b>. Present active participle of \agnoe&#333;\, old verb<br>
 from same root as \agn&#333;stos\ to which Paul refers by using it.<br>
 <B>{This set I forth unto you}</B> <b><i>(\touto ego kataggell&#333; humin\)</i></b>. He is<br>
 a \kataggeleus\ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->18)</i></b> as they suspected of a God, both old<br>
 and new, old in that they already worship him, new in that Paul<br>
 knows who he is. By this master stroke he has brushed to one side<br>
 any notion of violation of Roman law or suspicion of heresy and<br>
 claims their endorsement of his new gospel, a shrewd and<br>
 consummate turn. He has their attention now and proceeds to<br>
 describe this God left out of their list as the one true and<br>
 Supreme God. The later MSS. here read \hon--touton\ <b><i>(whom--this<br>
 one)</i></b> rather than \ho--touto\ <b><i>(what--this)</i></b>, but the late text is<br>
 plainly an effort to introduce too soon the personal nature of<br>
 God which comes out clearly in verse <!-#-->24.<br>
 <br>
 17:24 <B>{The God that made the world}</B> <b><i>(\Ho theos ho poi&#275;sas ton<br>
 kosmon\)</i></b>. Not a god for this and a god for that like the 30,000<br>
 gods of the Athenians, but the one God who made the Universe<br>
 <b><i>(\kosmos\ on the old Greek sense of orderly arrangement of the<br>
 whole universe)</i></b>. <B>{And all things therein}</B> <b><i>(\kai panta ta en<br>
 aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. All the details in the universe were created by this one<br>
 God. Paul is using the words of <!-#-->Isa 42:5. The Epicureans held<br>
 that matter was eternal. Paul sets them aside. This one God was<br>
 not to be confounded with any of their numerous gods save with<br>
 this "Unknown God." <B>{Being Lord of heaven and earth}</B> <b><i>(\ouranou<br>
 kai g&#275;s huparch&#333;n kurios\)</i></b>. \Kurios\ here owner, absolute<br>
 possessor of both heaven and earth <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 45:7)</i></b>, not of just<br>
 parts. <B>{Dwelleth not in temples made with hands}</B> <b><i>(\ouken<br>
 cheiropoi&#275;tois naois katoikei\)</i></b>. The old adjective<br>
 \cheiropoi&#275;tos\ <b><i>(\cheir, poie&#333;\)</i></b> already in Stephen's speech<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->7:48)</i></b>. No doubt Paul pointed to the wonderful Parthenon,<br>
 supposed to be the home of Athene as Stephen denied that God<br>
 dwelt alone in the temple in Jerusalem.<br>
 <br>
 17:25 <B>{As though he needed anything}</B> <b><i>(\prosdeomenos tinos\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present middle participle of \prosdeomai\, to want besides, old<br>
 verb, but here only in the N.T. This was strange doctrine for the<br>
 people thought that the gods needed their offerings for full<br>
 happiness. This self-sufficiency of God was taught by Philo and<br>
 Lucretius, but Paul shows that the Epicurean missed it by putting<br>
 God, if existing at all, outside the universe. <B>{Seeing he himself<br>
 giveth to all}</B> <b><i>(\autos didous pasin\)</i></b>. This Supreme Personal God<br>
 is the source of life, breath, and everything. Paul here rises<br>
 above all Greek philosophers.<br>
 <br>
 17:26 <B>{And he made of one}</B> <b><i>(\epoi&#275;sen te ex henos\)</i></b>. The word<br>
 \haimatos\ <b><i>(blood)</i></b> is absent from Aleph A B and is a later<br>
 explanatory addition. What Paul affirms is the unity of the human<br>
 race with a common origin and with God as the Creator. This view<br>
 runs counter to Greek exclusiveness which treated other races as<br>
 barbarians and to Jewish pride which treated other nations as<br>
 heathen or pagan <b><i>(the Jews were \laos\, the Gentiles \ethn&#275;\)</i></b>.<br>
 The cosmopolitanism of Paul here rises above Jew and Greek and<br>
 claims the one God as the Creator of the one race of men. The<br>
 Athenians themselves claimed to be \antochthonous\ <b><i>(indigenous)</i></b><br>
 and a special creation. Zeno and Seneca did teach a kind of<br>
 cosmopolitanism <b><i>(really pantheism)</i></b> far different from the<br>
 personal God of Paul. It was Rome, not Greece, that carried out<br>
 the moral ideas of Zeno. Man is part of the universe <b><i>(verse <!-#-->24)</i></b><br>
 and God created <b><i>(\epoi&#275;sen\)</i></b> man as he created <b><i>(\poi&#275;sas\)</i></b> the<br>
 all. <B>{For to dwell}</B> <b><i>(\katoikein\)</i></b>. Infinitive <b><i>(present active)</i></b> of<br>
 purpose, so as to dwell. <B>{Having determined}</B> <b><i>(\horisas\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active participle of \horiz&#333;\, old verb to make a horizon<br>
 as already in <!-#-->19:42 which see. Paul here touches God's<br>
 Providence. God has revealed himself in history as in creation.<br>
 His hand appears in the history of all men as well as in that of<br>
 the Chosen People of Israel. <B>{Appointed seasons}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\prostetagmenous kairous\)</i></b>. Not the weather as in <!-#-->14:17, but<br>
 "the times of the Gentiles" <b><i>(\kairoi ethn&#333;n\)</i></b> of which Jesus<br>
 spoke <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 21:24)</i></b>. The perfect passive participle of<br>
 \prostass&#333;\, old verb to enjoin, emphasizes God's control of<br>
 human history without any denial of human free agency as was<br>
 involved in the Stoic Fate <b><i>(\Heirmarmen&#275;\)</i></b>. <B>{Bounds}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\horothesias\)</i></b>. Limits? Same idea in <!-#-->Job 12:23. Nations rise<br>
 and fall, but it is not blind chance or hard fate. Thus there is<br>
 an interplay between God's will and man's activities, difficult<br>
 as it is for us to see with our shortened vision.<br>
 <br>
 17:27 <B>{That they should seek God}</B> <b><i>(\Z&#275;tein ton theon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Infinitive <b><i>(present active)</i></b> of purpose again. Seek him, not turn<br>
 away from him as the nations had done <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:18-32)</i></b>. <B>{If haply<br>
 they might feel after him}</B> <b><i>(\ei ara ge ps&#275;laph&#275;seian auton\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active <b><i>(Aeolic form)</i></b> optative of \ps&#275;lapha&#333;\, old<br>
 verb from \psa&#333;\, to touch. So used by the Risen Jesus in his<br>
 challenge to the disciples <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:39)</i></b>, by the Apostle John of<br>
 his personal contact with Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->1Jo 1:1)</i></b>, of the contact with<br>
 Mount Sinai <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 12:18)</i></b>. Here it pictures the blind groping of<br>
 the darkened heathen mind after God to "find him" <b><i>(\heuroien\,<br>
 second aorist active optative)</i></b> whom they had lost. One knows what<br>
 it is in a darkened room to feel along the walls for the door<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->De 28:29; Job 5:14; 12:25; Isa 59:10)</i></b>. Helen Keller, when told<br>
 of God, said that she knew of him already, groping in the dark<br>
 after him. The optative here with \ei\ is due to the condition of<br>
 the fourth class <b><i>(undetermined, but with vague hope of being<br>
 determined)</i></b> with aim also present <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 1021)</i></b>. Note also \ara ge\ the inferential particle \ara\ with the<br>
 delicate intensive particle \ge\. <B>{Though he is not far from each<br>
 one of us}</B> <b><i>(\kai ge ou makran apo henos hekastou h&#275;m&#333;n<br>
 huparchonta\)</i></b>. More exactly with B L <b><i>(\kai ge\ instead of<br>
 \kaitoi\ or \kaitoi ge\)</i></b>, "and yet being not far from each one of<br>
 us," a direct statement rather than a concessive one. The<br>
 participle \huparchonta\ agrees with \auton\ and the negative<br>
 \ou\ rather than the usual \me\ with the participle makes an<br>
 emphatic negative. Note also the intensive particle \ge\.<br>
 <br>
 17:28 <B>{For in him}</B> <b><i>(\en aut&#333;i gar\)</i></b>. Proof of God's nearness, not<br>
 stoic pantheism, but real immanence in God as God dwells in us.<br>
 The three verbs <b><i>(\z&#333;men, kinoumetha, esmen\)</i></b> form an ascending<br>
 scale and reach a climax in God <b><i>(life, movement, existence)</i></b>.<br>
 \Kinoumetha\ is either direct middle present indicative <b><i>(we move<br>
 ourselves)</i></b> or passive <b><i>(we are moved)</i></b>. <B>{As certain even of your<br>
 own poets}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s kai tines t&#333;n kath' hum&#257;s poi&#275;t&#333;n\)</i></b>. "As also<br>
 some of the poets among you." Aratus of Soli in Cilicia <b><i>(ab. B.C.<br>
 270)</i></b> has these very words in his _Ta Phainomena_ and Cleanthes,<br>
 Stoic philosopher <b><i>(300-220 B.C.)</i></b> in his _Hymn to Zeus_ has \Ek<br>
 sou gar genos esmen\. In <!-#-->1Co 15:32 Paul quotes from Menander<br>
 and in <!-#-->Tit 1:12 from Epimenides. J. Rendel Harris claims that<br>
 he finds allusions in Paul's Epistles to Pindar, Aristophanes,<br>
 and other Greek writers. There is no reason in the world why Paul<br>
 should not have acquaintance with Greek literature, though one<br>
 need not strain a point to prove it. Paul, of course, knew that<br>
 the words were written of Zeus <b><i>(Jupiter)</i></b>, not of Jehovah, but he<br>
 applies the idea in them to his point just made that all men are<br>
 the offspring of God.<br>
 <br>
 17:29 <B>{We ought not to think}</B> <b><i>(\ouk opheilomen nomizein\)</i></b>. It is<br>
 a logical conclusion <b><i>(\oun\, therefore)</i></b> from the very language of<br>
 Aratus and Cleanthes. <B>{That the Godhead is like}</B> <b><i>(\to theion<br>
 einai homoion\)</i></b>. Infinitive with accusative of general reference<br>
 in indirect discourse. \To theion\ is strictly "the divine"<br>
 nature like \theiot&#275;s\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:20)</i></b> rather than like \theot&#275;s\<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 2:9)</i></b>. Paul may have used \to theion\ here to get back<br>
 behind all their notions of various gods to the real nature of<br>
 God. The Athenians may even have used the term themselves. After<br>
 \homoios\ <b><i>(like)</i></b> the associative instrumental case is used as<br>
 with \chrus&#333;i, argur&#333;i, lith&#333;i\. <B>{Graven by art and device of<br>
 man}</B> <b><i>(\charagmati techn&#275;s kai enthum&#275;se&#333;s anthr&#333;pou\)</i></b>. Apposition<br>
 with preceding and so \charagmati\ in associative instrumental<br>
 case. Literally, graven work or sculpture from \charass&#333;\, to<br>
 engrave, old word, but here alone in N.T. outside of Revelation<br>
 <b><i>(the mark of the beast)</i></b>. Graven work of art <b><i>(\techn&#275;s\)</i></b> or<br>
 external craft, and of thought or device <b><i>(\enthum&#275;se&#333;s\)</i></b> or<br>
 internal conception of man.<br>
 <br>
 17:30 <B>{The times of ignorance}</B> <b><i>(\tous chronous t&#275;s agnoias\)</i></b>. The<br>
 times before full knowledge of God came in Jesus Christ. Paul<br>
 uses the very word for their ignorance <b><i>(\agnoountes\)</i></b> employed in<br>
 verse <!-#-->23. <B>{Overlooked}</B> <b><i>(\huperid&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \huperora&#333;\ or \hupereid&#333;\, old verb to see beyond,<br>
 not to see, to overlook, not "to wink at" of the Authorized<br>
 Version with the notion of condoning. Here only in the N.T. It<br>
 occurs in the LXX in the sense of overlooking or neglecting <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps<br>
 18:62; 55:1)</i></b>. But it has here only a negative force. God has all<br>
 the time objected to the polytheism of the heathen, and now he<br>
 has made it plain. In Wisdom 11:23 we have these words: "Thou<br>
 overlookest the sins of men to the end they may repent." <B>{But<br>
 now}</B> <b><i>(\ta nun\)</i></b>. Accusative of general reference, "as to the now<br>
 things or situation." All is changed now that Christ has come<br>
 with the full knowledge of God. See also <!-#-->27:22. <B>{All<br>
 everywhere}</B> <b><i>(\pantas pantachou\)</i></b>. No exceptions anywhere.<br>
 <B>{Repent}</B> <b><i>(\metanoein\)</i></b>. Present active infinitive of \metanoe&#333;\<br>
 in indirect command, a permanent command of perpetual force. See<br>
 on \metanoe&#333;\ &#175;Ac 2:38 and the Synoptic Gospels. This word was<br>
 the message of the Baptist, of Jesus, of Peter, of Paul, this<br>
 radical change of attitude and life.<br>
 <br>
 17:31 <B>{Inasmuch as}</B> <b><i>(\kathoti\)</i></b>. According as <b><i>(\kata, hoti\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 causal conjunction, but in N.T. only used in Luke's writings <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 1:7; 19:9; Ac 2:45; 4:35; 17:31)</i></b>. <B>{Hath appointed a day}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\est&#275;sen h&#275;meran\)</i></b> First aorist active indicative of \hist&#275;mi\,<br>
 to place, set. God did set the day in his counsel and he will<br>
 fulfil it in his own time. <B>{Will judge}</B> <b><i>(\mellei krinein\)</i></b>.<br>
 Rather, is going to judge, \mell&#333;\ and the present active<br>
 infinitive of \krin&#333;\. Paul here quotes <!-#-->Ps 9:8 where \krinei\<br>
 occurs. <B>{By the man whom he hath ordained}</B> <b><i>(\en andri h&#333;i<br>
 h&#333;risen\)</i></b>. Here he adds to the Psalm the place and function of<br>
 Jesus Christ, a passage in harmony with Christ's own words in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 25. \H&#333;i\ <b><i>(whom)</i></b> is attracted from the accusative, object of<br>
 \h&#333;risen\ <b><i>(first aorist active indicative of \horiz&#333;\)</i></b> to the<br>
 case of the antecedent \andri\. It has been said that Paul left<br>
 the simple gospel in this address to the council of the Areopagus<br>
 for philosophy. But did he? He skilfully caught their attention<br>
 by reference to an altar to an Unknown God whom he interprets to<br>
 be the Creator of all things and all men who overrules the whole<br>
 world and who now commands repentance of all and has revealed his<br>
 will about a day of reckoning when Jesus Christ will be Judge. He<br>
 has preached the unity of God, the one and only God, has<br>
 proclaimed repentance, a judgment day, Jesus as the Judge as<br>
 shown by his Resurrection, great fundamental doctrines, and<br>
 doubtless had much more to say when they interrupted his address.<br>
 There is no room here for such a charge against Paul. He rose to<br>
 a great occasion and made a masterful exposition of God's place<br>
 and power in human history. <B>{Whereof he hath given assurance}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pistin parasch&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of<br>
 \parech&#333;\, old verb to furnish, used regularly by Demosthenes for<br>
 bringing forward evidence. Note this old use of \pistis\ as<br>
 conviction or ground of confidence <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 11:1)</i></b> like a note or<br>
 title-deed, a conviction resting on solid basis of fact. All the<br>
 other uses of \pistis\ grow out of this one from \peith&#333;\, to<br>
 persuade. <B>{In that he hath raised him from the dead}</B> <b><i>(\anast&#275;sas<br>
 auton ek nekr&#333;n\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle of \anist&#275;mi\,<br>
 causal participle, but literally, "having raised him from the<br>
 dead." This Paul knew to be a fact because he himself had seen<br>
 the Risen Christ. Paul has here come to the heart of his message<br>
 and could now throw light on their misapprehension about "Jesus<br>
 and the Resurrection" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->18)</i></b>. Here Paul has given the proof<br>
 of all his claims in the address that seemed new and strange to<br>
 them.<br>
 <br>
 17:32 <B>{The resurrection of the dead}</B> <b><i>(\anastasin nekr&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Rather, "a resurrection of dead men." No article with either<br>
 word. The Greeks believed that the souls of men lived on, but<br>
 they had no conception of resurrection of the body. They had<br>
 listened with respect till Paul spoke of the actual resurrection<br>
 of Jesus from the dead as a fact, when they did not care to hear<br>
 more. <B>{Some mocked}</B> <b><i>(\hoi men echleuazon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of<br>
 \chleuaz&#333;\, a common verb <b><i>(from \chleu&#275;\, jesting, mockery)</i></b>. Only<br>
 here in the N.T. though late MSS. have it in <!-#-->2:13 <b><i>(best MSS.<br>
 \diachleuaz&#333;\)</i></b>. Probably inchoative here, began to mock. In<br>
 contempt at Paul's statement they declined to listen further to<br>
 "this babbler" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->18)</i></b> who had now lost what he had gained<br>
 with this group of hearers <b><i>(probably the light and flippant<br>
 Epicureans)</i></b>. <B>{But others}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de\)</i></b>. A more polite group like<br>
 those who had invited him to speak <b><i>(verse <!-#-->19)</i></b>. They were<br>
 unconvinced, but had better manners and so were in favour of an<br>
 adjournment. This was done, though it is not clear whether it was<br>
 a serious postponement or a courteous refusal to hear Paul<br>
 further <b><i>(probably this)</i></b>. It was a virtual dismissal of the<br>
 matter. " It is a sad story--the noblest of ancient cities and<br>
 the noblest man of history--and he never cared to look on it<br>
 again" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 17:33 <B>{Thus Paul went out from among them}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s ho Paulos<br>
 ex&#275;lthen ek mesou aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. No further questions, no effort to<br>
 arrest him, no further ridicule. He walked out never to return to<br>
 Athens. Had he failed?<br>
 <br>
 17:34 <B>{Clave unto him and believed}</B> <b><i>(\koll&#275;thentes aut&#333;i<br>
 episteusan\)</i></b>. First aorist passive of this strong word \kolla&#333;\,<br>
 to glue to, common in Acts <b><i>(<!-#-->5:13; 8:29; 9:26; 10:28)</i></b> No sermon<br>
 is a failure which leads a group of men <b><i>(\andres\)</i></b> to believe<br>
 <b><i>(ingressive aorist of \pisteu&#333;\)</i></b> in Jesus Christ. Many so-called<br>
 great or grand sermons reap no such harvest. <B>{Dionysius the<br>
 Areopagite}</B> <b><i>(\Dionusios ho Areopagit&#275;s\)</i></b>. One of the judges of<br>
 the Court of the Areopagus. That of itself was no small victory.<br>
 He was one of this college of twelve judges who had helped to<br>
 make Athens famous. Eusebius says that he became afterwards<br>
 bishop of the Church at Athens and died a martyr. <B>{A woman named<br>
 Damaris}</B> <b><i>(\gun&#275; onomati Damaris\)</i></b>. A woman by name Damaris. Not<br>
 the wife of Dionysius as some have thought, but an aristocratic<br>
 woman, not necessarily an educated courtezan as Furneaux holds.<br>
 And there were "others" <b><i>(\heteroi\)</i></b> with them, a group strong<br>
 enough to keep the fire burning in Athens. It is common to say<br>
 that Paul in <!-#-->1Co 2:1-5 alludes to his failure with philosophy<br>
 in Athens when he failed to preach Christ crucified and he<br>
 determined never to make that mistake again. On the other hand<br>
 Paul determined to stick to the Cross of Christ in spite of the<br>
 fact that the intellectual pride and superficial culture of<br>
 Athens had prevented the largest success. As he faced Corinth<br>
 with its veneer of culture and imitation of philosophy and sudden<br>
 wealth he would go on with the same gospel of the Cross, the only<br>
 gospel that Paul knew or preached. And it was a great thing to<br>
 give the world a sermon like that preached in Athens.<br>
