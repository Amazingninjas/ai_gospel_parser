 <HR>
<p>13:1 <B>{In the church that was there}</B> <b><i>(\kata t&#275;n ousan ekkl&#275;sian\)</i></b>.<br>
 Possibly distributed throughout the church <b><i>(note "in the church"<br>
 <!-#-->11:26)</i></b>. Now a strong organization there. Luke here begins the<br>
 second part of Acts with Antioch as the centre of operations, no<br>
 longer Jerusalem. Paul is now the central figure instead of<br>
 Peter. Jerusalem had hesitated too long to carry out the command<br>
 of Jesus to take the gospel to the whole world. That glory will<br>
 now belong to Antioch. <B>{Prophets and teachers}</B> <b><i>(\proph&#275;tai kai<br>
 didaskaloi\)</i></b>. All prophets were teachers, but not all teachers<br>
 were prophets who were for-speakers of God, sometimes<br>
 fore-speakers like Agabus in <!-#-->11:28. The double use of \te\ here<br>
 makes three prophets <b><i>(Barnabas, Symeon, Lucius)</i></b> and two teachers<br>
 <b><i>(Manaen and Saul)</i></b>. Barnabas heads the list <b><i>(<!-#-->11:22)</i></b> and Saul<br>
 comes last. Symeon Niger may be the Simon of Cyrene who carried<br>
 the Saviour's cross. Lucius of Cyrene was probably one of the<br>
 original evangelists <b><i>(<!-#-->11:20)</i></b>. The name is one of the forms of<br>
 Luke, but it is certainly not Luke the Physician. Manaen shows<br>
 how the gospel was reaching some of the higher classes <b><i>(home of<br>
 Herod Antipas)</i></b>. <B>{Foster-brother}</B> <b><i>(\suntrophos\)</i></b>. Old word for<br>
 nourished with or brought up with one _collactaneus_ <b><i>(Vulgate)</i></b>.<br>
 These are clearly the outstanding men in the great Greek church<br>
 in Antioch.<br>
 <br>
 13:2 <B>{As they ministered to the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\leitourgount&#333;n aut&#333;n toi<br>
 kuri&#333;i\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute of \leitourge&#333;\, old verb, used of<br>
 the Attic orators who served the state at their own cost \le&#333;s\<br>
 or \laos\, people, and \ergon\, work or service). Common in the<br>
 LXX of the priests who served in the tabernacle <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 28:31,39)</i></b><br>
 like \leitourgia\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:23)</i></b> which see. So in <!-#-->Heb 10:11. In<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 15:27 of aiding others in poverty. Here of worship <b><i>(prayer,<br>
 exhortation, fasting)</i></b>. The word liturgy grows out of this use.<br>
 <B>{And fasted}</B> <b><i>(\kai n&#275;steuont&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute also.<br>
 Christian Jews were keeping up the Jewish fast <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 18:12)</i></b>. Note<br>
 fasting also in the choice of elders for the Mission Churches<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 14:23)</i></b>. Fasting was not obligatory on the Christians, but<br>
 they were facing a great emergency in giving the gospel to the<br>
 Gentile world. <B>{Separate me}</B> <b><i>(\aphorisate d&#275; moi\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active imperative of \aphoriz&#333;\, old verb to mark off boundaries<br>
 or horizon, used by Paul of his call <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:1; Ga 1:15)</i></b>. The<br>
 Greek has \d&#275;\, a shortened form of \&#275;d&#275;\ and like Latin _jam_<br>
 and German _doch_, now therefore. It ought to be preserved in the<br>
 translation. Cf. <!-#-->Lu 2:15; Ac 15:36; 1Co 6:20. \Moi\ is the<br>
 ethical dative. As in verse <!-#-->1 Barnabas is named before Saul.<br>
 Both had been called to ministry long ago, but now this call is<br>
 to the special campaign among the Gentiles. Both had been active<br>
 and useful in such work. <B>{Whereunto}</B> <b><i>(\ho\)</i></b>. Here \eis\ has to be<br>
 repeated from \eis to ergon\ just before, "for which" as Jesus<br>
 sent the twelve and the seventy in pairs, so here. Paul nearly<br>
 always had one or more companions.<br>
 <br>
 13:3 <B>{When they had fasted}</B> <b><i>(\n&#275;steusantes\)</i></b>. Either finishing<br>
 the same fast in verse <!-#-->2 or another one <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>, but clearly<br>
 a voluntary fast. <B>{Laid their hands upon them}</B> <b><i>(\epithentes tas<br>
 cheiras autois\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle of<br>
 \epitith&#275;mi\. Not ordination to the ministry, but a solemn<br>
 consecration to the great missionary task to which the Holy<br>
 Spirit had called them. Whether the whole church took part in<br>
 this ceremony is not clear, though in <!-#-->15:40 "the brethren" did<br>
 commend Paul and Silas. Perhaps some of them here acted for the<br>
 whole church, all of whom approved the enterprise. But Paul makes<br>
 it plain in <!-#-->Php 4:15 that the church in Antioch did not make<br>
 financial contribution to the campaign, but only goodwill. But<br>
 that was more than the church at Jerusalem would have done as a<br>
 whole since Peter had been arraigned there for his activities in<br>
 Caesarea <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:1-18)</i></b>. Clearly Barnabas and Saul had to finance<br>
 the tour themselves. It was Philippi that first gave money to<br>
 Paul's campaigns. There were still heathen enough in Antioch, but<br>
 the church approved the going of Barnabas and Saul, their very<br>
 best.<br>
 <br>
 13:4 <B>{So they}</B> <b><i>(\autoi men oun\)</i></b>. They themselves indeed<br>
 therefore. No contrast is necessary, though there is a slight one<br>
 in verses <!-#-->5,6. Luke again refers to the Holy Spirit as the<br>
 source of their authority for this campaign rather than the<br>
 church at Antioch. <B>{Sent forth}</B> <b><i>(\ekpemphthentes\)</i></b>. Old verb from<br>
 \ekpemp&#333;\ and first aorist passive participle, but in the N.T.<br>
 only here and <!-#-->Ac 17:10. <B>{Sailed}</B> <b><i>(\apepleusan\)</i></b>. Effective<br>
 aorist active indicative of \apople&#333;\, old verb to sail away,<br>
 depart from. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->14:26; 20:15; 27:1.<br>
 Barnabas was from Cyprus where there were many Jews.<br>
 <br>
 13:5 <B>{Proclaimed}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;ggellon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of<br>
 \kataggell&#333;\, inchoative, began to proclaim. This was Paul's rule<br>
 of procedure, "to the Jew first" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:16; Ac 13:46; 17:2;<br>
 18:4,19; 19:8)</i></b>. <B>{They had also}</B> <b><i>(\eichon de kai\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active, descriptive. <B>{As their attendant}</B> <b><i>(\hup&#275;ret&#275;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "under-rower" <b><i>(\hupo, &#275;ret&#275;s\)</i></b> in the trireme.<br>
 Probably here minister <b><i>(\chazzan\)</i></b> or assistant in the synagogue<br>
 as in <!-#-->Lu 4:20. Cf. <!-#-->Mt 5:25. It is not clear what John Mark<br>
 did, though he was evidently selected by Barnabas as his cousin.<br>
 He may have helped in the baptizing. There were probably others<br>
 also in the company <b><i>(verse <!-#-->13)</i></b>. The "also" may mean that Mark<br>
 did some preaching. Barnabas was probably the leader in the work<br>
 in these Jewish synagogues.<br>
 <br>
 13:6 <B>{Unto Paphos}</B> <b><i>(\achri Paphou\)</i></b>. The new Paphos at the other<br>
 end of the island, reached by a fine Roman road, some eight miles<br>
 north of the old Paphos famous for the worship of Venus. <B>{A<br>
 certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew}</B> <b><i>(\andra tina magon<br>
 pseudoproph&#275;t&#275;n Ioudaion\)</i></b>. Literally, "a certain man" <b><i>(\andra<br>
 tina\)</i></b> with various descriptive epithets. The word \magon\ does<br>
 not necessarily mean "sorcerer," but only a \magus\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 2:1,7,10 which see)</i></b>. The bad sense occurs in <!-#-->Ac 8:9,11 <b><i>(Simon<br>
 Magus)</i></b> and is made plain here by "false prophet." In verse <!-#-->8<br>
 here Barjesus <b><i>(Son of Jesus)</i></b> is called "Elymas the sorcerer <b><i>(or<br>
 Magian)</i></b>," probably his professional title, as Luke interprets the<br>
 Arabic or Aramaic word Elymas. These Jewish mountebanks were<br>
 numerous and had great influence with the uneducated. In <!-#-->Ac<br>
 19:13 the seven sons of Sceva, Jewish exorcists, tried to<br>
 imitate Paul. If one is surprised that a man like Sergius Paulus<br>
 should fall under the influence of this fraud, he should recall<br>
 what Juvenal says of the Emperor Tiberius "sitting on the rock of<br>
 Capri with his flock of Chaldaeans around him."<br>
 <br>
 13:7 <B>{With the proconsul Sergius Paulus}</B> <b><i>(\sun t&#333;i anthupat&#333;i<br>
 Sergi&#333;i Paul&#333;i\)</i></b>. Luke used to be sharply criticized for applying<br>
 this term to Sergius Paulus on the ground that Cyprus was a<br>
 province under the appointment of the emperor with the title of<br>
 propraetor and not under the control of the senate with the title<br>
 of proconsul. That was true B.C. 30, but five years later it was<br>
 changed to proconsul by Augustus and put under the control of the<br>
 Senate. Two inscriptions have been found with the date A.D. 51<br>
 and 52 with the names of proconsuls of Cyprus and one is in the<br>
 Cesnola Collection, an inscription found at Soli with the name of<br>
 Paulus as Proconsul, undoubtedly this very man, though no date<br>
 occurs. <B>{A man of understanding}</B> <b><i>(\andri sunet&#333;i\)</i></b>. All the more<br>
 amazing that he should be a victim of Barjesus. He had given up<br>
 idolatry at any rate and was eager to hear Barnabas and Saul.<br>
 <br>
 13:8 <B>{Withstood them}</B> <b><i>(\anthistato autois\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of<br>
 \anthist&#275;mi\, to stand against <b><i>(face to face)</i></b>. Dative case<br>
 <b><i>(\autois\)</i></b>. He persisted in his opposition and was unwilling to<br>
 lose his great prize. There may have been a public discussion<br>
 between Elymas and Saul. <B>{To turn aside}</B> <b><i>(\diastrepsai\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active infinitive of \diastreph&#333;\, old verb to turn or<br>
 twist in two, to distort, to pervert <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mt 17:17; Lu 23:2)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:9 <B>{But Saul, who is also called Paul}</B> <b><i>(\Saulos de, ho kai<br>
 Paulos\)</i></b>. By this remarkably brief phrase Luke presents this<br>
 epoch in the life of Saul Paul. The "also" <b><i>(\kai\)</i></b> does not mean<br>
 that the name Paul was given now for the first time, rather than<br>
 he had always had it. As a Jew and a Roman citizen, he<br>
 undoubtedly had both names all the time <b><i>(cf. John Mark, Symeon<br>
 Niger, Barsabbas Justus)</i></b>. Jerome held that the name of Sergius<br>
 Paulus was adopted by Saul because of his conversion at this<br>
 time, but this is a wholly unlikely explanation, "an element of<br>
 vulgarity impossible to St. Paul " <b><i>(Farrar)</i></b>. Augustine thought<br>
 that the meaning of the Latin _paulus_ <b><i>(little)</i></b> would incline<br>
 Saul to adopt, "but as a proper name the word rather suggested<br>
 the glories of the Aemilian family, and even to us recalls the<br>
 name of another Paulus, who was 'lavish of his noble life'"<br>
 <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. Among the Jews the name Saul was naturally used up to<br>
 this point, but from now on Luke employs Paul save when there is<br>
 a reference to his previous life <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 22:7; 26:14)</i></b>. His real<br>
 career is work among the Gentiles and Paul is the name used by<br>
 them. There is a striking similarity in sound between the Hebrew<br>
 Saul and the Roman Paul. Paul was proud of his tribe of Benjamin<br>
 and so of King Saul <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 3:5)</i></b>. <B>{Filled with the Holy Spirit}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pl&#275;stheis pneumatos hagiou\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> passive<br>
 participle of \pimpl&#275;mi\ with the genitive case. A special influx<br>
 of power to meet this emergency. Here was a cultured heathen,<br>
 typical of the best in Roman life, who called forth all the<br>
 powers of Paul plus the special help of the Holy Spirit to expose<br>
 the wickedness of Elymas Barjesus. If one wonders why the Holy<br>
 Spirit filled Paul for this emergency rather than Barnabas, when<br>
 Barnabas was named first in <!-#-->13:2, he can recall the sovereignty<br>
 of the Holy Spirit in his choice of agents <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 12:4-11)</i></b> and<br>
 also the special call of Paul by Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 9:15; 26:17f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Fastened his eyes}</B> <b><i>(\atenisas\)</i></b>. As already in <!-#-->Lu 4:20; 22:56;<br>
 Ac 3:4,12; 6:15; 10:4.<br>
 <br>
 13:10 <B>{Of all guile}</B> <b><i>(\pantos dolou\)</i></b>. From \del&#333;\, to catch with<br>
 bait, old word, already seen in <!-#-->Mt 26:4; Mr 7:22; 14:1. Paul<br>
 denounces Elymas as a trickster. <B>{All villainy}</B> <b><i>(\p&#257;s&#275;s<br>
 rh&#257;idiourgias\)</i></b>. Late compound from \rh&#257;idiourgos\ <b><i>(\rh&#257;idios\,<br>
 easy, facile, \ergon\, deed, one who does a thing adroitly and<br>
 with ease)</i></b>. So levity in Xenophon and unscrupulousness in<br>
 Polybius, Plutarch, and the papyri. Only here in the N.T., though<br>
 the kindred word \rh&#257;idiourg&#275;ma\ occurs in <!-#-->Ac 18:14. With<br>
 deadly accuracy Paul pictured this slick rascal. <B>{Thou son of the<br>
 devil}</B> <b><i>(\huie diabolou\)</i></b>. Damning phrase like that used by Jesus<br>
 of the Pharisees in <!-#-->Joh 8:44, a slanderer like the \diabolos\.<br>
 This use of son <b><i>(\huios\)</i></b> for characteristic occurs in <!-#-->Ac 3:25;<br>
 4:36, a common Hebrew idiom, and may be used purposely by Paul<br>
 in contrast with the name Barjesus <b><i>(son of Jesus)</i></b> that Elymas<br>
 bore <b><i>(<!-#-->13:6)</i></b>. <B>{Enemy of all righteousness}</B> <b><i>(\echthre p&#257;s&#275;s<br>
 dikaiosun&#275;s\)</i></b>. Personal enemy to all justice, sums up all the<br>
 rest. Note triple use of "all" <b><i>(\pantos, p&#257;s&#275;s, p&#257;s&#275;s\)</i></b>, total<br>
 depravity in every sense. <B>{Wilt thou not cease?}</B> <b><i>(\ou paus&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 An impatient rhetorical question, almost volitive in force<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 874)</i></b>. Note \ou\, not \m&#275;\, <B>{To pervert}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\diastreph&#333;n\)</i></b>. Present active participle describing the actual<br>
 work of Elymas as a perverter or distorter <b><i>(see verse <!-#-->8)</i></b>. More<br>
 exactly, Wilt thou not cease perverting? <B>{The right ways of the<br>
 Lord}</B> <b><i>(\tas hodous tou kuriou tas eutheias\)</i></b>. The ways of the<br>
 Lord the straight ones as opposed to the crooked ways of men<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Isa 40:4; 42:16; Lu 3:5)</i></b>. The task of John the Baptist as of<br>
 all prophets and preachers is to make crooked paths straight and<br>
 to get men to walk in them. This false prophet was making even<br>
 the Lord's straight ways crooked. Elymas has many successors.<br>
 <br>
 13:11 <B>{Upon thee}</B> <b><i>(\epi se\)</i></b>. The use of \epi\ with the<br>
 accusative is rich and varied, the precise shade of meaning<br>
 depending on the content. The "hand of the Lord" might be kindly<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 11:21)</i></b> or hostile <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 10:31)</i></b>, but when God's hand<br>
 touches one's life <b><i>(<!-#-->Job 19:21)</i></b> it may be in judgment as here<br>
 with Elymas. He has not humbled himself under the mighty hand of<br>
 God <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 5:6)</i></b>. <B>{Not seeing}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; blep&#333;n\)</i></b>. Repeating with<br>
 negative participle the negative idea in "blind" <b><i>(\tuphlos\)</i></b>. "It<br>
 was a judicial infliction; blindness for blindness, darkness<br>
 without for wilful darkness within" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. He was an example<br>
 of the blind leading the blind that was to cease and Sergius<br>
 Paulus was to be led into the light. The blindness was to be "for<br>
 a season" <b><i>(\achri kairou\, <!-#-->Lu 4:13)</i></b>, if it should please God to<br>
 restore his sight. Paul apparently recalls his own blindness as<br>
 he entered Damascus. <B>{A mist}</B> <b><i>(\achlus\)</i></b>. Especially a dimness of<br>
 the eyes, old poetic word and late prose, in LXX, only here in<br>
 N.T. Galen uses it of the opacity of the eye caused by a wound.<br>
 <B>{He went about seeking some one to lead him by the hand}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\periag&#333;n ez&#275;tei cheirag&#333;gous\)</i></b>. A rather free rendering.<br>
 Literally, "going about <b><i>(\periag&#333;n\, present active participle of<br>
 \periag&#333;\)</i></b> he was seeking <b><i>(\ez&#275;tei\, imperfect active of \z&#275;te&#333;\)</i></b><br>
 guides <b><i>(\cheirag&#333;gous\, from \cheir\, hand, and \ag&#333;gos\, guide,<br>
 from \ag&#333;\, one who leads by the hand)</i></b>." The very verb<br>
 \cheirag&#333;ge&#333;\, to lead by the hand, Luke uses of Paul in <!-#-->9:8,<br>
 as he entered Damascus.<br>
 <br>
 13:12 <B>{Believed}</B> <b><i>(\episteusen\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist active<br>
 indicative. Renan considers it impossible that a Roman proconsul<br>
 could be converted by a miracle. But it was the teaching about<br>
 the Lord <b><i>(\tou kuriou\, objective genitive)</i></b> by which he was<br>
 astonished <b><i>(\ekpl&#275;ssomenos\, present passive participle of<br>
 \ekpl&#275;ss&#333;\, see on &#175;Mt 7:28)</i></b> or struck out as well as by the<br>
 miracle. The blindness came "immediately" <b><i>(\paraehr&#275;ma\)</i></b> upon the<br>
 judgment pronounced by Paul. It is possible that Sergius Paulus<br>
 was converted to Christ without openly identifying himself with<br>
 the Christians as his baptism is not mentioned as in the case of<br>
 Cornelius. But, even if he was baptized, he need not have been<br>
 deposed from his proconsulship as Furneaux and Rackham argue<br>
 because his office called for "official patronage of idolatrous<br>
 worship." But that could have been merely perfunctory as it<br>
 probably was already. He had been a disciple of the Jewish<br>
 magician, Elymas Barjesus, without losing his position. Imperial<br>
 persecution against Christianity had not yet begun. Furneaux even<br>
 suggests that the conversion of a proconsul to Christianity at<br>
 this stage would have called for mention by the Roman and Greek<br>
 historians. There is the name Sergia Paullina in a Christian<br>
 cemetery in Rome which shows that one of his family was a<br>
 Christian later. One will believe what he wills about Sergius<br>
 Paulus, but I do not see that Luke leaves him in the category of<br>
 Simon Magus who "believed" <b><i>(<!-#-->8:13)</i></b> for revenue only.<br>
 <br>
 13:13 <B>{Paul and his company}</B> <b><i>(\hoi peri Paulon\)</i></b>. Neat Greek<br>
 idiom as in Plato, Cratylus 440 C \hoi peri Herakleiton\. On this<br>
 idiom see Gildersleeve, _Syntax_, p. 264. It means a man and his<br>
 followers, "those around Paul." Now Paul ranks first always in<br>
 Acts save in <!-#-->14:2; 15:12,25 for special reasons. Heretofore<br>
 Saul <b><i>(Paul)</i></b> held a secondary position <b><i>(<!-#-->9:27; 11:30; 13:1f.)</i></b>.<br>
 "In nothing is the greatness of Barnabas more manifest than in<br>
 his recognition of the superiority of Paul and acceptance of a<br>
 secondary position for himself" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. <B>{Set sail}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anachthentes\)</i></b>. First aorist passive participle of \anag&#333;\.<br>
 Thirteen times in the Acts and <!-#-->Lu 8:22 which see. They sailed<br>
 up to sea and came down <b><i>(\katag&#333;, katabain&#333;\)</i></b> to land. So it<br>
 looks. <B>{Departed from them}</B> <b><i>(\apoch&#333;r&#275;sas ap' aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active participle of \apoch&#333;re&#333;\, old verb to withdraw, go<br>
 away from. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mt 7:23; Lu 9:39. He is<br>
 called John there as in verse <!-#-->5 and Mark in <!-#-->15:39, though<br>
 John Mark in <!-#-->12:12,25. This may be accidental or on purpose<br>
 <b><i>(Deissmann, _Bible Studies_, p. 317)</i></b>. Luke is silent on John's<br>
 reasons for leaving Paul and Barnabas. He was the cousin of<br>
 Barnabas and may not have relished the change in leadership.<br>
 There may have been change in plans also now that Paul is in<br>
 command. Barnabas had chosen Cyprus and Paul has led them to<br>
 Perga in Pamphylia and means to go on into the highlands to<br>
 Antioch in Pisidia. There were perils of many sorts around them<br>
 and ahead <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:26)</i></b>, perils to which John Mark was unwilling<br>
 to be exposed. Paul will specifically charge him at Antioch with<br>
 desertion of his post <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:39)</i></b>. It is possible, as Ramsay<br>
 suggests, that the mosquitoes at Perga gave John malaria. If so,<br>
 they bit Paul and Barnabas also. He may not have liked Paul's<br>
 aggressive attitude towards the heathen. At any rate he went home<br>
 to Jerusalem instead of to Antioch, _zu seiner Mutter_<br>
 <b><i>(Holtzmann)</i></b>. It was a serious breach in the work, but Paul and<br>
 Barnabas stuck to the work.<br>
 <br>
 13:14 <B>{Passing through}</B> <b><i>(\dielthontes\)</i></b>. It is not clear why Paul<br>
 and Barnabas left Perga so soon nor why they went to Antioch in<br>
 Pisidia. Ramsay suggests malaria that spurred them on to the<br>
 hills after the desertion of John Mark. They preached at Perga on<br>
 the return <b><i>(<!-#-->14:25)</i></b> and apparently hurried away now. Farrar<br>
 thinks that the hot weather had driven the population to the<br>
 hills. At any rate it is not difficult to imagine the perils of<br>
 this climb over the rough mountain way from Perga to Pisidian<br>
 Antioch to which Paul apparently refers in <!-#-->2Co 11:26. <B>{Sat<br>
 down}</B> <b><i>(\ekathisan\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist active indicative, took<br>
 their seats as visiting Jews, possibly in the seats of the rabbis<br>
 <b><i>(J. Lightfoot)</i></b>. Whether they expected to be called on or not,<br>
 they were given the opportunity as prominent visitors. The<br>
 Pisidian Antioch was really in Phrygia, but towards Pisidia to<br>
 distinguish it from Antioch on the Maeander <b><i>(Ramsay, _Church in<br>
 the Roman Empire_, p. 25)</i></b>. It was a colony like Philippi and so a<br>
 free city. If Paul is referring to South Galatia and not North<br>
 Galatia in <!-#-->Ga 4:13 when he says that his preaching in Galatia<br>
 at first was due to illness, then it was probably here at<br>
 Pisidian Antioch. What it was we have no means of knowing, though<br>
 it was a temptation in his flesh to them so severe that they were<br>
 willing to pluck out their eyes for him <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 4:14f.)</i></b>. Opthalmia,<br>
 malaria, epilepsy have all been suggested as this stake in the<br>
 flesh <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 12:7)</i></b>. But Paul was able to preach with power<br>
 whatever his actual physical condition was.<br>
 <br>
 13:15 <B>{After the reading of the law and the prophets}</B> <b><i>(\meta t&#275;n<br>
 anagn&#333;sin tou nomou kai t&#333;n proph&#275;t&#333;n\)</i></b>. The law was first read<br>
 in the synagogues till B.C. 163 when Antiochus Epiphones<br>
 prohibited it. Then the reading of the prophets was substituted<br>
 for it. The Maccabees restored both. There was a reading from the<br>
 law and one from the prophets in Hebrew which was interpreted<br>
 into the Aramaic or the Greek _Koin&#275;_ for the people. The reading<br>
 was followed by the sermon as when Jesus was invited to read and<br>
 to preach in Nazareth <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 4:16f.)</i></b>. For the service in the<br>
 synagogue see Schuerer, _History of the Jewish People_, Div. II,<br>
 Vol. II, pp. 79ff. It was the duty of the rulers of the synagogue<br>
 <b><i>(\archisunag&#333;goi\)</i></b> to select the readers and the speakers for the<br>
 service <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 5:22,35-38; Lu 8:49; 13:14; Ac 13:15; 18:8,17)</i></b>. Any<br>
 rabbi or distinguished stranger could be called on to speak. <B>{If<br>
 ye have any word of exhortation for the people}</B> <b><i>(\ei tis estin en<br>
 humin logos parakl&#275;se&#333;s pros ton laon\)</i></b>. Literally, if there is<br>
 among you any word of exhortation for the people. It is a<br>
 condition of the first class and assumed to be true, a polite<br>
 invitation. On "exhortation" <b><i>(\parakl&#275;sis\)</i></b> see <!-#-->9:31. It may be<br>
 a technical phrase used in the synagogue <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 13:22; 1Ti 4:13)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:16 <B>{Paul stood up}</B> <b><i>(\anastas Paulos\)</i></b>. The Jewish custom was<br>
 to sit while speaking <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 4:20)</i></b>, but the Greek and Roman was to<br>
 stand <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 17:22)</i></b>. It is possible as Lewin <b><i>(_Life of St. Paul_,<br>
 Vol. 1, p. 141)</i></b> suggests that here Paul stepped upon the platform<br>
 and then took his seat as he began to speak or he may have<br>
 followed the Greek and Roman custom. Paul is the leader now and<br>
 the more gifted speaker <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 14:12)</i></b>, so that he responds to the<br>
 courteous invitation of the rulers. <B>{Beckoning}</B> <b><i>(\kataseisas\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active participle of \katasei&#333;\, old verb to shake<br>
 down, a dramatic gesture for quiet and order like Peter in<br>
 <!-#-->12:17 and Paul on the steps of the tower of Antonia <b><i>(<!-#-->21:40)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{And ye that fear God}</B> <b><i>(\kai hoi phoboumenoi ton theon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Evidently large numbers of these Gentiles like Cornelius in<br>
 Caesarea were present. They offered Paul a great opportunity for<br>
 reaching the purely pagan Gentiles. This <b><i>(verses <!-#-->16-41)</i></b> is the<br>
 first full report of a sermon of Paul's that Luke has preserved<br>
 for us. He is now a practised preacher of the gospel that he<br>
 began proclaiming at Damascus, that Jesus of Nazareth is the<br>
 Messiah of promise and the Saviour of the whole world both Jew<br>
 and Gentile if they will only believe on him and be saved. It is<br>
 possible that Paul here based his sermon on the passages of the<br>
 law and the prophets that had just been read. He uses two words<br>
 from the LXX, one in verse <!-#-->19 from <!-#-->De 1:31 \etrophophor&#275;sen\<br>
 <b><i>(as a nursing-father bare he them)</i></b>, the reading of many old MSS.<br>
 and the one preferred by the American Committee, the other in<br>
 verse <!-#-->17 from <!-#-->Isa 1:2 \hups&#333;sen\ <b><i>(exalted)</i></b>. At any rate it is<br>
 clear that Paul spoke in Greek so that all could understand his<br>
 sermon. He may have written out notes of this sermon afterwards<br>
 for Luke. The keynotes of Paul's theology as found in his<br>
 Epistles appear in this sermon. It is interesting to observe the<br>
 steady growth of Paul's Christology as he faced the great<br>
 problems of his day. Here we see Paul's gospel for the Jews and<br>
 the God-fearers <b><i>(Gentiles friendly to the Jews)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:17 <B>{Chose}</B> <b><i>(\exelexato\)</i></b>. First aorist middle <b><i>(indirect)</i></b>,<br>
 selected for himself. Israel was the chosen people. <B>{Exalted}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hups&#333;sen\)</i></b>. From \hupso&#333;\, late verb from \hupsos\ so often<br>
 used of Christ. <B>{When they sojourned}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i paroiki&#257;i\)</i></b>. In<br>
 the sojourn. Late word from \paroikos\ <b><i>(sojourner, dweller, <!-#-->Ac<br>
 7:6)</i></b> common in LXX. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->1Pe 1:17. <B>{With a<br>
 high arm}</B> <b><i>(\meta brachionos hups&#275;lou\)</i></b>. Vivid picture from the<br>
 LXX <b><i>(<!-#-->Ex 6:1,6; De 5:15; Ps 136:12)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:18 <B>{Suffered he their manners}</B> <b><i>(\etropophor&#275;sen\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active indicative of \tropophore&#333;\, late word from<br>
 \tropos\, manner, and \pher&#333;\, reading of Aleph B D and accepted<br>
 by Westcott and Hort. But A C Sahidic Bohairic read<br>
 \etrophophor&#275;sen\ from \trophophore&#333;\ <b><i>(\trophos\, a nurse, and<br>
 \pher&#333;\,)</i></b> late word <b><i>(II Macc. 7:27)</i></b>, probably correct word here<br>
 and <!-#-->De 1:31.<br>
 <br>
 13:19 <B>{When he had destroyed}</B> <b><i>(\kathel&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \kathaire&#333;\, to tear down, old verb. <B>{He gave them<br>
 for an inheritance}</B> <b><i>(\katekl&#275;ronom&#275;sen\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of the double compound verb \kata-kl&#275;ro-nome&#333;\, late<br>
 verb in LXX <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 34:18; De 3:28; Jos 14:1)</i></b> and only here in the<br>
 N.T., to distribute by lot, to distribute as an inheritance. This<br>
 is the correct reading and not \katekl&#275;rodot&#275;sen\ from<br>
 \katakl&#275;rodote&#333;\ of the Textus Receptus. These two verbs were<br>
 confused in the MSS. of the LXX as well as here. <B>{For about four<br>
 hundred and fifty years}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s etesin tetrakosiois kai<br>
 pent&#275;konta\)</i></b>. Associative instrumental case with an expression of<br>
 time as in <!-#-->8:11; Lu 8:29 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 527)</i></b>. The<br>
 oldest MSS. <b><i>(Aleph A B C Vg Sah Boh)</i></b> place these figures before<br>
 "after these things" and so in verse <!-#-->19. This is the true<br>
 reading and is in agreement with the notation in <!-#-->1Ki 6:1. The<br>
 difficulty found in the Textus Receptus <b><i>(King James Version)</i></b> thus<br>
 disappears with the true text. The four hundred and fifty years<br>
 runs therefore from the birth of Isaac to the actual conquest of<br>
 Canaan and does not cover the period of the Judges. See on &#175;Ac<br>
 7:6.<br>
 <br>
 13:20 <B>{And after these things}</B> <b><i>(\kai meta tauta\)</i></b>. That is, the<br>
 time of the Judges then began. Cf. <!-#-->Jud 2:16. <B>{Until Samuel the<br>
 prophet}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s Samou&#275;l proph&#275;tou\)</i></b>. The _terminus ad quem_. He<br>
 was the last of the judges and the first of the prophets who<br>
 selected the first king <b><i>(Saul)</i></b> under God's guidance. Note the<br>
 absence of the Greek article with \proph&#275;tou\.<br>
 <br>
 13:21 <B>{They asked}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;it&#275;santo\)</i></b>. First aorist indirect middle<br>
 indicative, they asked for themselves. They were tired of a<br>
 theocracy. Cf. <!-#-->1Sa 8:5; 10:1. Paul mentions with pride that<br>
 Benjamin was the tribe of Saul <b><i>(his name also)</i></b>, but he does not<br>
 allude to Saul's sin <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. <B>{For the space of forty years}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\et&#275; tesserakonta\)</i></b>. Accusative of extent of time. Not in the<br>
 O.T., but in Josephus, _Ant_. VI. 14, 9.<br>
 <br>
 13:22 <B>{When he had removed him}</B> <b><i>(\metast&#275;sas auton\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active participle of \methist&#275;mi\, old verb to transfer,<br>
 to transpose <b><i>(note force of \meta\)</i></b>. This verb occurs in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 16:4 by the unjust steward about his removal from office. Cf.<br>
 <!-#-->1Sa 15:16. <B>{To be}</B> <b><i>(\eis\)</i></b>. As or for, Greek idiom like the<br>
 Hebrew _le_, common in the LXX. <B>{A man after my heart}</B> <b><i>(\andra<br>
 kata t&#275;n kardian mou\)</i></b>. The words quoted by Paul as a direct<br>
 saying of God are a combination of <!-#-->Ps 89:20, 21; 1Sa 13:14 <b><i>(the<br>
 word of the Lord to Samuel about David)</i></b>. Knowling thinks that<br>
 this free and rather loose quotation of the substance argues for<br>
 the genuineness of the report of Paul's sermon. Hackett observes<br>
 that the commendation of David is not absolute, but, as compared<br>
 with the disobedient Saul, he was a man who did God's will in<br>
 spite of the gross sin of which he repented <b><i>(<!-#-->Ps 51)</i></b>. Note<br>
 "wills" <b><i>(\thel&#275;mata\)</i></b>, plural, of God.<br>
 <br>
 13:23 <B>{Of this man's seed}</B> <b><i>(\toutou apo tou spermatos\)</i></b>. Emphatic<br>
 position of \toutou\. Of this one from the <b><i>(his)</i></b> seed. <B>{According<br>
 to promise}</B> <b><i>(\kat' epaggelian\)</i></b>. This phrase in <!-#-->Ga 3:29; 2Ti<br>
 1:1. See the promise in <!-#-->2Sa 7:2; Ps 132:11; Isa 11:1,10; Jer<br>
 23:5f.; Zec 3:8. In <!-#-->Zec 3:8 the verb \ag&#333;\ is used of the<br>
 sending of the Messiah as here. <B>{A Saviour Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\S&#333;t&#275;ra<br>
 I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. Jesus is in apposition with Saviour <b><i>(accusative case)</i></b><br>
 and comes at the end of the sentence in contrast with "this man"<br>
 <b><i>(David)</i></b> at the beginning. Paul goes no further than David because<br>
 he suggests to him Jesus, descendant in the flesh from David. By<br>
 "Israel" here Paul means the Jewish people, though he will later<br>
 enlarge this promise to include the spiritual Israel both Gentile<br>
 and Jew <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 9:6f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:24 <B>{When John had first preached}</B> <b><i>(\prok&#275;ruxantos I&#333;anou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, John heralding beforehand, as a herald before the king<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 3:3)</i></b>. Genitive absolute of first aorist active participle<br>
 of \prok&#275;russ&#333;\, old verb to herald beforehand, here alone in the<br>
 N.T., though Textus Receptus has it also in <!-#-->Ac 3:20. <B>{Before<br>
 his coming}</B> <b><i>(\pro pros&#333;pou t&#275;s eisodou autou\)</i></b>. Literally, before<br>
 the face of his entering in <b><i>(here act of entrance as <!-#-->1Th 1:9,<br>
 not the gate as in <!-#-->Heb 10:19)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mal 3:1 quoted in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 11:10 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 7:27)</i></b> for this Hebrew phrase and also <!-#-->Lu 1:76.<br>
 <B>{The baptism of repentance}</B> <b><i>(\baptisma metanoias\)</i></b>. Baptism<br>
 marked by, characterized by <b><i>(genitive case, case of kind or<br>
 species)</i></b> repentance <b><i>(change of mind and life)</i></b>. The very phrase<br>
 used of John's preaching in <!-#-->Mr 1:4; Lu 3:3. It is clear<br>
 therefore that Paul understood John's ministry and message as did<br>
 Peter <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 2:38; 10:37)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:25 <B>{As John was fulfilling his course}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s epl&#275;rou I&#333;an&#275;s<br>
 ton dromon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \pl&#275;ro&#333;\, describing his vivid<br>
 ministry without defining the precise period when John asked the<br>
 question. Paul uses this word \dromos\ <b><i>(course)</i></b> of his own race<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:24; 2Ti 4:7)</i></b>. <B>{What suppose ye that I am?}</B> <b><i>(\Ti eme<br>
 huponoeite einai?\)</i></b> Note \ti\ <b><i>(neuter)</i></b>, not \tina\ <b><i>(masculine)</i></b>,<br>
 <B>{what}</B> not <B>{who}</B>, character, not identity. It is indirect<br>
 discourse <b><i>(the infinitive \einai\ and the accusative of general<br>
 reference)</i></b>. <B>{Huponoe&#333;}</B> <b><i>(\hupo, noe&#333;\)</i></b> is to think secretly, to<br>
 suspect, to conjecture. <B>{I am not he}</B> <b><i>(\ouk eimi eg&#333;\)</i></b>. These<br>
 precise words are not given in the Gospels, but the idea is the<br>
 same as the disclaimers by the Baptist in <!-#-->Joh 1:19-27 <b><i>(cf. also<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 3:11; Mr 1:7; Lu 3:16)</i></b>. Paul had a true grasp of the message<br>
 of the Baptist. He uses the very form \l&#8211;sai\ <b><i>(first aorist<br>
 active infinitive of \lu&#333;\)</i></b> found in <!-#-->Mr 1:7; Lu 3:16 and the<br>
 word for shoes <b><i>(\hupod&#275;ma\, singular)</i></b> in all three. His quotation<br>
 is remarkably true to the words in the Synoptic Gospels. How did<br>
 Paul get hold of the words of the Baptist so clearly?<br>
 <br>
 13:26 <B>{To us}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;min\)</i></b>. Both Jews and Gentiles, both classes in<br>
 Paul's audience, dative of advantage. <B>{Is sent forth}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\exapestal&#275;\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive indicative of the double<br>
 compound verb \exapostell&#333;\, common verb to send out <b><i>(\ex\)</i></b> and<br>
 forth <b><i>(\apo\)</i></b>. It is a climacteric or culminative aorist tense.<br>
 It has come to us in one day, this glorious promise. <B>{The word of<br>
 this salvation}</B> <b><i>(\ho logos t&#275;s s&#333;t&#275;rias taut&#275;s\)</i></b>. The message of<br>
 Jesus as Saviour <b><i>(verse <!-#-->23)</i></b>, long ago promised and now come to<br>
 us as Saviour.<br>
 <br>
 13:27 <B>{Because they knew him not}</B> <b><i>(\touton agno&#275;santes\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active participle <b><i>(causal)</i></b> of \agnoe&#333;\, old verb, not to<br>
 know. Peter gives "ignorance" <b><i>(\agnoia\)</i></b> as the excuse of the<br>
 Jews in the death of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->3:17)</i></b> and Paul does the same about<br>
 his conduct before his conversion <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ti 1:13)</i></b>. This ignorance<br>
 mitigated the degree of their guilt, but it did not remove it,<br>
 for it was willing ignorance and prejudice. <B>{The voices of the<br>
 prophets which are read}</B> <b><i>(\tas ph&#333;nas t&#333;n proph&#275;t&#333;n tas<br>
 anagin&#333;skomenas\)</i></b>. Object also of \agno&#275;santes\, though it could<br>
 be the object of \epl&#275;r&#333;san\ <b><i>(fulfilled)</i></b> if \kai\ is taken as<br>
 "also". The "voices" were heard as they were read aloud each<br>
 Sabbath in the synagogue. In their ignorant condemnation they<br>
 fulfilled the prophecies about the suffering Messiah.<br>
 <br>
 13:28 <B>{Though they found no cause of death}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;demian aitian<br>
 thanatou heurontes\)</i></b>. Second aorist active with usual negative of<br>
 the participle. As a matter of fact the Sanhedrin did charge<br>
 Jesus with blasphemy, but could not prove it <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 26:65; 27:24;<br>
 Lu 23:22)</i></b>. At this time no Gospel had probably been written, but<br>
 Paul knew that Jesus was innocent. He uses this same idiom about<br>
 his own innocence <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 28:18)</i></b>. <B>{That he should be slain}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\anaireth&#275;nai auton\)</i></b>. First aorist passive infinitive, the<br>
 accusative case, the direct object of \&#275;it&#275;santo\ <b><i>(first aorist<br>
 middle indicative, asked as a favour to themselves)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:29 <B>{From the tree}</B> <b><i>(\apo tou xulou\)</i></b>. Not here strictly a<br>
 tree, but wood as already in <!-#-->5:30; 10:29 and later in <!-#-->Ga<br>
 3:13. Strictly speaking, it was Joseph of Arimathea and<br>
 Nicodemus who took the body of Jesus down from the cross, though<br>
 the Jews had asked Pilate to have the bones of Jesus broken that<br>
 his body should not remain on the cross during the Sabbath <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 19:31)</i></b>. Paul does not distinguish the details here. <B>{Laid}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eth&#275;kan\)</i></b>. First <b><i>(kappa)</i></b> aorist active indicative third plural<br>
 of \tith&#275;mi\ in place of \ethesan\ the usual second aorist active<br>
 plural form. <B>{Tomb}</B> <b><i>(\mn&#275;meion\)</i></b>. Memorial, common in the<br>
 Gospels.<br>
 <br>
 13:30 <B>{But God raised him from the dead}</B> <b><i>(\ho de theos &#275;geiren ek<br>
 nekr&#333;n\)</i></b>. This crucial fact Paul puts sharply as he always did.<br>
 <br>
 13:31 <B>{Was seen for many days}</B> <b><i>(\&#333;phth&#275; epi h&#275;meras pleious\)</i></b>.<br>
 The common verb <b><i>(first aorist passive indicative of \hora&#333;\, to<br>
 see)</i></b> for the appearance of the Risen Christ, the one used by Paul<br>
 of his own vision of Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:8)</i></b>, which is not reported<br>
 by Luke here. For more days <b><i>(than a few)</i></b>, the language means,<br>
 forty in all <b><i>(<!-#-->1:3)</i></b>. <B>{Of them that came up with him}</B> <b><i>(\tois<br>
 sunanab&#257;sin aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Dative <b><i>(after \&#333;phth&#275;\)</i></b> articular participle<br>
 <b><i>(second aorist active of \sunanabain&#333;\)</i></b> with associative<br>
 instrumental case <b><i>(\aut&#333;i\)</i></b>, the very men who knew him best and<br>
 who could not be easily deceived about the reality of his<br>
 resurrection. But this fact rules Paul out on this point, for he<br>
 had not fellowshipped with Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem. <B>{Who<br>
 are now his witnesses}</B> <b><i>(\hoitines nun eisin martures autou\)</i></b>. The<br>
 very point that Peter used to clinch his argument with such<br>
 powerful effect <b><i>(<!-#-->2:32; 3:15)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:32 <B>{We bring you good tidings of the promise}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meis hum&#257;s<br>
 euaggelizometha t&#275;n epaggelian\)</i></b>. Two accusatives here <b><i>(person<br>
 and thing)</i></b>, old Greek did not use accusative of the person with<br>
 this verb as in <!-#-->16:10; Lu 3:18. Note "we you" together. Here<br>
 the heart of Paul's message on this occasion.<br>
 <br>
 13:33 <B>{Hath fulfilled}</B> <b><i>(\ekpepl&#275;r&#333;ken\)</i></b>. Hath filled out <b><i>(\ek\)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Unto our children}</B> <b><i>(\tois teknois h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. The MSS. vary greatly<br>
 here about \h&#275;m&#333;n\ <b><i>(our)</i></b>, some have \aut&#333;n\, some \aut&#333;n h&#275;min\.<br>
 Westcott and Hort consider these readings "a primitive error" for<br>
 \h&#275;min\ <b><i>(to us)</i></b> taken with \anast&#275;sas I&#275;soun\ <b><i>(having for us<br>
 raised up Jesus)</i></b>. This raising up <b><i>(from \anist&#275;mi\, set up)</i></b> as in<br>
 <!-#-->3:22; 7:37 refers not to resurrection <b><i>(verse <!-#-->34)</i></b>, but to the<br>
 sending of Jesus <b><i>(two raisings up)</i></b>. <B>{In the second psalm}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 t&#333;i psalm&#333;i t&#333;i deuter&#333;i\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Ps 2:7. D has \pr&#333;t&#333;i\ because the<br>
 first psalm was often counted as merely introductory.<br>
 <br>
 13:34 <B>{Now no more to return to corruption}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;keti mellonta<br>
 hupostrephein eis diaphthoran\)</i></b>. No longer about to return as<br>
 Lazarus did. Jesus did not die again and so is the first fruits<br>
 of the resurrection <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:23; Ro 6:9)</i></b>. <B>{He hath spoken}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eir&#275;ken\)</i></b>. Present perfect active indicative, common way of<br>
 referring to the permanent utterances of God which are on record<br>
 in the Scriptures. <B>{The holy and sure blessings of David}</B> <b><i>(\ta<br>
 hosia Daueid ta pista\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->2Sa 7:13. Literally, "the holy<br>
 things of David the trustworthy things." He explains "the holy<br>
 things" at once.<br>
 <br>
 13:35 <B>{Because}</B> <b><i>(\dioti\)</i></b>. Compound conjunction <b><i>(\dia, hoti\)</i></b><br>
 like our "because that." The reason for the previous statement<br>
 about "the holy things." <B>{Thou wilt not give thy holy one to see<br>
 corruption}</B> <b><i>(\ou d&#333;seis ton hosion sou idein diaphthoran\)</i></b>.<br>
 Quotation from <!-#-->Ps 16:10 to show that Jesus did not see<br>
 corruption in his body, a flat contradiction for those who deny<br>
 the bodily resurrection of Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 13:36 <B>{His own generation}</B> <b><i>(\idi&#257;i gene&#257;i\)</i></b>. Either locative<br>
 case, "in his own generation" or dative object of \hup&#275;ret&#275;sas\<br>
 <b><i>(served)</i></b>. <B>{The counsel of God}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i tou theou boul&#275;i\)</i></b>. So here,<br>
 either the dative, the object of \hup&#275;ret&#275;sas\ if \gene&#257;i\ is<br>
 locative, or the instrumental case "by the counsel of God" which<br>
 again may be construed either with \hup&#275;ret&#275;sas\ <b><i>(having served)</i></b><br>
 or after \ekoim&#275;th&#275;\ <b><i>(fell on sleep)</i></b>. Either of the three ways is<br>
 grammatical and makes good sense. \Koimaomai\ for death we have<br>
 already had <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 7:60)</i></b>. So Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 11:11)</i></b> and Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 15:6,51)</i></b>. <B>{Was laid}</B> <b><i>(\proseteth&#275;\)</i></b>. Was added unto <b><i>(first<br>
 aorist passive indicative of \prostith&#275;mi\)</i></b>. See the verb in<br>
 <!-#-->2:47; 5:14. This figure for death probably arose from the<br>
 custom of burying families together <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 15:15; Jud 2:10)</i></b>. <B>{Saw<br>
 corruption}</B> <b><i>(\eiden diaphthoran\)</i></b>. As Jesus did not <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 2:31)</i></b><br>
 as he shows in verse <!-#-->37.<br>
 <br>
 13:38 <B>{Through this man}</B> <b><i>(\dia toutou\)</i></b>. This very man whom the<br>
 Jews had crucified and whom God had raised from the dead.<br>
 Remission of sins <b><i>(\aphesis hamarti&#333;n\)</i></b> is proclaimed<br>
 <b><i>(\kataggelletai\)</i></b> to you. This is the keynote of Paul's message<br>
 as it had been that of Peter at Pentecost <b><i>(<!-#-->2:38; 5:31; 10:43)</i></b>.<br>
 Cf. <!-#-->26:18. This glorious message Paul now presses home in his<br>
 exhortation.<br>
 <br>
 13:39 <B>{And by him every one that believeth is justified from all<br>
 things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai apo pant&#333;n h&#333;n ouk &#275;dun&#275;th&#275;te en nom&#333;i M&#333;use&#333;s dikaioth&#275;nai<br>
 en tout&#333;i p&#257;s ho pisteu&#333;n dikaioutai\)</i></b>. This is a characteristic<br>
 Greek sentence with the principal clause at the end and Pauline<br>
 to the core. A literal rendering as to the order would be: "And<br>
 from all the things from <b><i>(\apo\ not repeated in the Greek, but<br>
 understood, the ablative case being repeated)</i></b> which ye were not<br>
 able to be justified in this one every one who believes is<br>
 justified." The climax is at the close and gives us the heart of<br>
 Paul's teaching about Christ. "We have here the germ of all that<br>
 is most characteristic in Paul's later teaching. It is the<br>
 argument of the Epistle to Galatians and Romans in a sentence"<br>
 <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. The failure of the Mosaic law to bring the kind of<br>
 righteousness that God demands is stated. This is made possible<br>
 in and by <b><i>(\en\)</i></b> Christ alone. Paul's favourite words occur here,<br>
 \pisteu&#333;\, believe, with which \pistis\, faith, is allied,<br>
 \dikaio&#333;\, to set right with God on the basis of faith. In <!-#-->Ro<br>
 6:7 Paul uses \apo\ also after \dikaio&#333;\. These are key words<br>
 <b><i>(\pisteu&#333;\ and \dikaio&#333;\)</i></b> in Paul's theology and call for<br>
 prolonged and careful study if one is to grasp the Pauline<br>
 teaching. \Dikaio&#333;\ primarily means to make righteous, to declare<br>
 righteous like \axio&#333;\, to deem worthy <b><i>(\axios\)</i></b>. But in the end<br>
 Paul holds that real righteousness will come <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 6-8)</i></b> to those<br>
 whom God treats as righteous <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 3-5)</i></b> though both Gentile and<br>
 Jew fall short without Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1-3)</i></b>. This is the doctrine of<br>
 grace that will prove a stumbling block to the Jews with their<br>
 ceremonial works and foolishness to the Greeks with their<br>
 abstract philosophical ethics <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 1:23-25)</i></b>. It is a new and<br>
 strange doctrine to the people of Antioch.<br>
 <br>
 13:40 <B>{Beware therefore}</B> <b><i>(\blepete oun\)</i></b>. The warning is<br>
 pertinent. Perhaps Paul noticed anger on the faces of some of the<br>
 rabbis. <B>{Lest there come upon you}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; epelth&#275;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active subjunctive with the negative final conjunction \m&#275;\. <B>{In<br>
 the prophets}</B> <b><i>(\en tois proph&#275;tais\)</i></b>. The quotation is from the<br>
 LXX text of <!-#-->Hab 1:5. The plural here refers to the prophetic<br>
 collection <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:44; Ac 24:14)</i></b>. "The Jews of Habakkuk's day<br>
 had refused to believe in the impending invasion by the<br>
 Chaldeans, and yet it had come" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:41 <B>{Ye despisers}</B> <b><i>(\hoi kataphron&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Not in the Hebrew,<br>
 but in the LXX. It is pertinent for Paul's purpose. <B>{Perish}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aphanisth&#275;te\)</i></b>. Or vanish away. First aorist passive<br>
 imperative. Added by the LXX to the Hebrew. <B>{If one declare it<br>
 unto you}</B> <b><i>(\ean tis ekdi&#275;g&#275;tai humin\)</i></b>. Condition of third class<br>
 with present middle subjunctive, if one keep on outlining <b><i>(double<br>
 compound, \ek-di-&#275;geomai\)</i></b> it unto you. Paul has hurled a<br>
 thunderbolt at the close.<br>
 <br>
 13:42 <B>{And as they went out}</B> <b><i>(\Exiont&#333;n de aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute with present active participle of \exeimi\, to go out,<br>
 old verb, in the N.T. only in <!-#-->Ac 12:42; 17:15; 20:7; 27:43. As<br>
 they <b><i>(Paul and Barnabas)</i></b> were going out with all the excitement<br>
 and hubbub created by the sermon. <B>{They besought}</B> <b><i>(\parekaloun\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active, inchoative, began to beseech. The Textus<br>
 Receptus inserts wrongly \ta ethn&#275;\ <b><i>(the Gentiles)</i></b> as if the Jews<br>
 were opposed to Paul from the first as some doubtless were. But<br>
 both Jews and Gentiles asked for the repetition of the sermon<br>
 <b><i>(\lal&#275;th&#275;nai\, first aorist passive infinitive object of<br>
 \parekaloun\ with accusative of general reference)</i></b>. <B>{The next<br>
 Sabbath}</B> <b><i>(\eis to metaxu sabbaton\)</i></b>. Late use <b><i>(Josephus,<br>
 Plutarch, etc.)</i></b> of \metaxu\ <b><i>(\meta\ and \xun\=\sun\)</i></b> in sense of<br>
 after or next instead of between <b><i>(sense of \meta\ prevailing)</i></b>.<br>
 Note use of \eis\ for "on" or "by."<br>
 <br>
 13:43 <B>{When the synagogue broke up}</B> <b><i>(\lutheis&#275;s t&#275;s sunag&#333;g&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute of first aorist passive participle of \lu&#333;\.<br>
 Apparently Paul and Barnabas had gone out before the synagogue<br>
 was formally dismissed. <B>{Of the devout proselytes}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n<br>
 sebomen&#333;n pros&#275;lut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Of the worshipping proselytes described<br>
 in verses <!-#-->16,25 as "those who fear God" <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->16:14)</i></b> employed<br>
 usually of the uncircumcised Gentiles who yet attended the<br>
 synagogue worship, but the word \pros&#275;lutoi\ <b><i>(\pros, &#275;lutos\<br>
 verbal from \erchomai\, a new-comer)</i></b> means usually those who had<br>
 become circumcised <b><i>(proselytes of righteousness)</i></b>. Yet the rabbis<br>
 used it also of proselytes of the gate who had not yet become<br>
 circumcised, probably the idea here. In the N.T. the word occurs<br>
 only in <!-#-->Mt 23:15; Ac 2:10; 6:5; 13:43. Many <b><i>(both Jews and<br>
 proselytes)</i></b> followed <b><i>(\&#275;kolouth&#275;san\, ingressive aorist active<br>
 indicative of \akolouthe&#333;\)</i></b> Paul and Barnabas to hear more<br>
 without waiting till the next Sabbath. So we are to picture Paul<br>
 and Barnabas speaking <b><i>(\proslalountes\, late compound, in N.T.<br>
 only here and <!-#-->28:20)</i></b> to eager groups. <B>{Urged}</B> <b><i>(\epeithon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active of \peith&#333;\, either descriptive <b><i>(were<br>
 persuading)</i></b> or conative <b><i>(were trying to persuade)</i></b>. Paul had great<br>
 powers of persuasion <b><i>(<!-#-->18:4; 19:8,26; 26:28; 28:23; 2Co 5:11; Ga<br>
 1:10)</i></b>. These Jews "were beginning to understand for the first<br>
 time the true meaning of their national history" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>, "the<br>
 grace of God" to them.<br>
 <br>
 13:44 <B>{The next Sabbath}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i erchomen&#333;i sabbat&#333;i\)</i></b>. Locative<br>
 case, on the coming <b><i>(\erchomen&#333;i\, present middle participle of<br>
 \erchomai\)</i></b> Sabbath. So the best MSS., though some have<br>
 \echomen&#333;i\ <b><i>(present middle participle of \ech&#333;\ in sense of<br>
 near, bordering, following as in <!-#-->Lu 13:33; Ac 29:15)</i></b>. <B>{Almost}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\schedon\)</i></b>. Old word, but in N.T. only here, <!-#-->Ac 19:26; Heb<br>
 9:22. <B>{Was gathered together}</B> <b><i>(\sun&#275;chth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 <b><i>(effective)</i></b> passive indicative of \sunag&#333;\, old and common verb.<br>
 The "whole city" could hardly all gather in the synagogue.<br>
 Perhaps Paul spoke in the synagogue and Barnabas to the overflow<br>
 outside <b><i>(see verse <!-#-->46)</i></b>. It was an eager and earnest gathering<br>
 "to hear <b><i>(\akousai\, first aorist active infinitive of purpose)</i></b><br>
 the word of God" and a great opportunity for Paul and Barnabas.<br>
 The Codex Bezae has it "to hear Paul." It was the new preacher<br>
 <b><i>(Paul)</i></b> that drew the big crowd. It was a crowd such as will later<br>
 hang on the words of John Wesley and George Whitfield when they<br>
 preach Jesus Christ.<br>
 <br>
 13:45 <B>{The Jews}</B> <b><i>(\hoi Ioudaioi\)</i></b>. Certainly not the proselytes<br>
 of verse <!-#-->43. Probably many of the Jews that were then<br>
 favourably disposed to Paul's message had reacted against him<br>
 under the influence of the rabbis during the week and evidently<br>
 on this Sabbath very many Gentiles <b><i>("almost the whole city," "the<br>
 multitudes" \tous ochlous\)</i></b> had gathered, to the disgust of the<br>
 stricter Jews. Nothing is specifically stated here about the<br>
 rabbis, but they were beyond doubt the instigators of, and the<br>
 ringleaders in, the opposition as in Thessalonica <b><i>(<!-#-->17:5)</i></b>. No<br>
 such crowds <b><i>(\ochlous\)</i></b> came to the synagogue when they were the<br>
 speakers. <B>{With jealousy}</B> <b><i>(\z&#275;lou\)</i></b>. Genitive case of \z&#275;los\<br>
 <b><i>(from \ze&#333;\, to boil)</i></b> after \epl&#275;sth&#275;san\ <b><i>(effective first aorist<br>
 passive indicative of \pimpl&#275;mi\)</i></b>. Envy and jealousy arise<br>
 between people of the same calling <b><i>(doctors towards doctors,<br>
 lawyers towards lawyers, preachers towards preachers)</i></b>. So these<br>
 rabbis boiled with jealousy when they saw the crowds gathered to<br>
 hear Paul and Barnabas. <B>{Contradicted}</B> <b><i>(\antelegon\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active of \antileg&#333;\, old verb to speak against, to say a word in<br>
 opposition to <b><i>(\anti\, face to face)</i></b>. It was interruption of the<br>
 service and open opposition in the public meeting. Paul and<br>
 Barnabas were guests by courtesy and, of course, could not<br>
 proceed further, when denied that privilege. <B>{Blasphemed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\blasph&#275;mountes\)</i></b>. Blaspheming. So the correct text without the<br>
 addition \antilegontes\ <b><i>(repeated from \antelegon\ above)</i></b>. Common<br>
 verb in the Gospels for saying injurious and harmful things.<br>
 Doubtless these rabbis indulged in unkind personalities and made<br>
 it plain that Paul and Barnabas were going beyond the limitations<br>
 of pure Judaism in their contacts with Gentiles.<br>
 <br>
 13:46 <B>{Spake out boldly}</B> <b><i>(\parr&#275;siasamenoi\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 participle of \parr&#275;siazomai\, to use freedom in speaking, to<br>
 assume boldness. Both Paul and Barnabas accepted the challenge of<br>
 the rabbis. They would leave their synagogue, but not without a<br>
 word of explanation. <B>{It was necessary to you first}</B> <b><i>(\Humin &#275;n<br>
 anagkaion pr&#333;ton\)</i></b>. They had done their duty and had followed the<br>
 command of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->1:8)</i></b>. They use the very language of Peter in<br>
 <!-#-->3:26 <b><i>(\humin pr&#333;ton\)</i></b> "to you first." This position Paul as the<br>
 apostle to the Gentiles will always hold, the Jew first in<br>
 privilege and penalty <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:16; 2:9,10)</i></b>. <B>{Ye thrust it from<br>
 you}</B> <b><i>(\ap&#333;theisthe auton\)</i></b>. Present middle <b><i>(indirect, from<br>
 yourselves)</i></b> indicative of \ap&#333;the&#333;\, to push from. Vigorous verb<br>
 seen already in <!-#-->Ac 7:27,39 which see. <B>{Judge yourselves<br>
 unworthy}</B> <b><i>(\ouk axious krinete heautous\)</i></b>. Present active<br>
 indicative of the common verb \krin&#333;\, to judge or decide with<br>
 the reflexive pronoun expressed. Literally, Do not judge<br>
 yourselves worthy. By their action and their words they had taken<br>
 a violent and definite stand. <B>{Lo, we turn to the Gentiles}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\idou strephometha eis ta ethn&#275;\)</i></b>. It is a crisis <b><i>(\idou\, lo)</i></b>:<br>
 "Lo, we turn ourselves to the Gentiles." Probably also aoristic<br>
 present, we now turn <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 864-70)</i></b>.<br>
 \Strephometha\ is probably the direct middle <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, pp. 806-08)</i></b> though the aorist passive \estraph&#275;n\ is<br>
 so used also <b><i>(<!-#-->7:39)</i></b>. It is a dramatic moment as Paul and<br>
 Barnabas turn from the Jews to the Gentiles, a prophecy of the<br>
 future history of Christianity. In <!-#-->Ro 9-11 Paul will discuss at<br>
 length the rejection of Christ by the Jews and the calling of the<br>
 Gentiles to be the real <b><i>(the spiritual)</i></b> Israel.<br>
 <br>
 13:47 <B>{For so hath the Lord commanded us}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s gar entetaltai<br>
 h&#275;min ho kurios\)</i></b>. Perfect middle indicative of \entell&#333;\, poetic<br>
 <b><i>(Pindar)</i></b> and late verb to enjoin <b><i>(<!-#-->1:2)</i></b>. The command of the Lord<br>
 Paul finds in <!-#-->Isa 49:6 quoted by Simeon also <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:32)</i></b>. The<br>
 conviction of Paul's mind was now made clear by the fact of the<br>
 rejection by the Jews. He could now see more clearly the words of<br>
 the prophet about the Gentiles: The Messiah is declared by God in<br>
 Isaiah to be "a light to the Gentiles" <b><i>(\ethn&#333;n\, objective<br>
 genitive)</i></b>, "a light for revelation to the Gentiles" <b><i>(\ph&#333;s eis<br>
 apokalupsin ethn&#333;n\, <!-#-->Lu 2:32)</i></b>. So Paul is carrying out the will<br>
 of God in turning to the Gentiles. He will still appeal to the<br>
 Jews elsewhere as they allow him to do so, but not here. <B>{That<br>
 thou shouldest be}</B> <b><i>(\tou einai se\)</i></b>. Genitive articular<br>
 infinitive of purpose with the accusative of general reference.<br>
 This is all according to God's fixed purpose <b><i>(\tetheika\, perfect<br>
 active indicative of \tith&#275;mi\)</i></b>. <B>{Unto the uttermost part of the<br>
 earth}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s eschatou t&#275;s g&#275;s\)</i></b>. Unto the last portion <b><i>(genitive<br>
 neuter, not feminine)</i></b> of the earth. It is a long time from Paul<br>
 to now, not to say from Isaiah to now, and not yet has the gospel<br>
 been carried to half of the people of earth. God's people are<br>
 slow in carrying out God's plans for salvation.<br>
 <br>
 13:48 <B>{As the Gentiles heard this they were glad}</B> <b><i>(\akouonta ta<br>
 ethn&#275; echairon\)</i></b>. Present active participle of \akou&#333;\ and<br>
 imperfect active of \chair&#333;\, linear action descriptive of the<br>
 joy of the Gentiles. <B>{Glorified the word of God}</B> <b><i>(\edoxazon ton<br>
 logon tou theou\)</i></b>. Imperfect active again. The joy of the<br>
 Gentiles increased the fury of the Jews. "The synagogue became a<br>
 scene of excitement which must have been something like the<br>
 original speaking with tongues" <b><i>(Rackham)</i></b>. The joy of the<br>
 Gentiles was to see how they could receive the higher blessing of<br>
 Judaism without circumcision and other repellent features of<br>
 Jewish ceremonialism. It was the gospel of grace and liberty from<br>
 legalism that Paul had proclaimed. Whether <!-#-->Ga 4:13 describes<br>
 this incident or not <b><i>(the South Galatian theory)</i></b>, it illustrates<br>
 it when Gentiles received Paul as if he were Christ Jesus<br>
 himself. It was triumph with the Gentiles, but defeat with the<br>
 Jews. <B>{As many as were ordained to eternal life}</B> <b><i>(\hosoi &#275;san<br>
 tetagmenoi eis z&#333;&#275;n ai&#333;nion\)</i></b>. Periphrastic past perfect passive<br>
 indicative of \tass&#333;\, a military term to place in orderly<br>
 arrangement. The word "ordain" is not the best translation here.<br>
 "Appointed," as Hackett shows, is better. The Jews here had<br>
 voluntarily rejected the word of God. On the other side were<br>
 those Gentiles who gladly accepted what the Jews had rejected,<br>
 not all the Gentiles. Why these Gentiles here ranged themselves<br>
 on God's side as opposed to the Jews Luke does not tell us. This<br>
 verse does not solve the vexed problem of divine sovereignty and<br>
 human free agency. There is no evidence that Luke had in mind an<br>
 _absolutum decretum_ of personal salvation. Paul had shown that<br>
 God's plan extended to and included Gentiles. Certainly the<br>
 Spirit of God does move upon the human heart to which some<br>
 respond, as here, while others push him away. <B>{Believed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\episteusan\)</i></b>. Summary or constative first aorist active<br>
 indicative of \pisteu&#333;\. The subject of this verb is the relative<br>
 clause. By no manner of legerdemain can it be made to mean "those<br>
 who believe were appointed." It was saving faith that was<br>
 exercised only by those who were appointed unto eternal life, who<br>
 were ranged on the side of eternal life, who were thus revealed<br>
 as the subjects of God's grace by the stand that they took on<br>
 this day for the Lord. It was a great day for the kingdom of God.<br>
 <br>
 13:49 <B>{Was spread abroad}</B> <b><i>(\diephereto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive of<br>
 \diapher&#333;\, to carry in different directions <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b>. By the<br>
 recent converts as well as by Paul and Barnabas. This would seem<br>
 to indicate a stay of some months with active work among the<br>
 Gentiles that bore rich fruit. <B>{Throughout all the region}</B> <b><i>(\di'<br>
 hol&#275;s t&#275;s ch&#333;ras\)</i></b>. Antioch in Pisidia as a Roman colony would be<br>
 the natural centre of a Roman _Regio_, an important element in<br>
 Roman imperial administration. There were probably other<br>
 _Regiones_ in South Galatia <b><i>(Ramsay, _St. Paul the Traveller and<br>
 Roman Citizen_, pp. 102-12)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 13:50 <B>{Urged on}</B> <b><i>(\par&#333;trunan\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b> active<br>
 of \par-otrun&#333;\, old verb, but here alone in the N.T., to incite,<br>
 to stir up. The Jews were apparently not numerous in this city as<br>
 they had only one synagogue, but they had influence with people<br>
 of prominence, like "the devout women of honourable estate" <b><i>(\tas<br>
 sebomenas gunaikas tas eusch&#275;monas\)</i></b>, the female proselytes of<br>
 high station, a late use of an old word used about Joseph of<br>
 Arimathea <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 15:43)</i></b>. The rabbis went after these Gentile women<br>
 who had embraced Judaism <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ac 17:4 in Thessalonica)</i></b> as Paul<br>
 had made an appeal to them. The prominence of women in public<br>
 life here at Antioch is quite in accord with what we know of<br>
 conditions in the cities of Asia Minor. "Thus women were<br>
 appointed under the empire as magistrates, as presidents of the<br>
 games, and even the Jews elected a woman as Archisynagogos, at<br>
 least in one instance at Smyrna" <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. In Damascus Josephus<br>
 <b><i>(_War_ II. 20, 21)</i></b> says that a majority of the married women were<br>
 proselytes. Strabo <b><i>(VIII. 2)</i></b> and Juvenal <b><i>(VI. 542)</i></b> speak of the<br>
 addiction of women to the Jewish religion. <B>{The chief men of the<br>
 city}</B> <b><i>(\tous pr&#333;tous t&#275;s pole&#333;s\)</i></b>. Probably city officials <b><i>(the<br>
 Duumviri, the Praetors, the First Ten in the Greek Cities of the<br>
 east)</i></b> or other "foremost" men, not officials. The rabbis were<br>
 shrewd enough to reach these men <b><i>(not proselytes)</i></b> through the<br>
 women who were proselytes of distinction. <B>{Stirred up a<br>
 persecution}</B> <b><i>(\ep&#275;geiran di&#333;gmon\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of \epegeir&#333;\, old verb, but in the N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->14:2. Paul seems to allude to this persecution in <!-#-->2Ti 3:11<br>
 "persecutions, sufferings, what things befell me at Antioch, at<br>
 Iconium, at Lystra, what persecutions I endured." Here Paul had<br>
 perils from his own countrymen and perils from the Gentiles after<br>
 the perils of rivers and perils of robbers on the way from Perga<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:26)</i></b>. He was thrice beaten with rods <b><i>(\tris<br>
 erhabdisth&#275;n\, <!-#-->2Co 11:25)</i></b> by Roman lictors in some Roman<br>
 colony. If that was here, then Paul and Barnabas were publicly<br>
 scourged by the lictors before they left. Probably the Jews<br>
 succeeded in making the Roman officials look on Paul and Barnabas<br>
 as disturbers of the public peace. So "they cast them out of<br>
 their borders" <b><i>(\exebalon autous apo t&#333;n hori&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active indicative of \ekball&#333;\, forcible expulsion plainly<br>
 as public nuisances. Just a few days before they were the heroes<br>
 of the city and now!<br>
 <br>
 13:51 <B>{But they shook off the dust of their feet against them}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Hoi de ektinaxamenoi ton koniorton t&#333;n pod&#333;n ep' autous\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist middle <b><i>(indirect)</i></b> participle of \ektinass&#333;\, to<br>
 shake out or off. Homer uses it for knocking out teeth. In the<br>
 papyri. The middle aorist participle occurs again in <!-#-->18:6 and<br>
 the active imperative with the dust of the feet in <!-#-->Mr 6:11 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 10:11 has \apomassometha\)</i></b>. and <!-#-->Mt 10:14 <b><i>(command of Jesus)</i></b>.<br>
 It is a dramatic gesture that forbids further intercourse. "As a<br>
 protest against the injustice which cast them out. The sandal was<br>
 taken off and the dust shaken out as a symbolic token that the<br>
 very soil of the country was defiling" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. <B>{Unto Iconium}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eis Ikonion\)</i></b>. About 45 miles southeast from Antioch in<br>
 Pisidia, at the foot of the Taurus mountains. At various times it<br>
 was reckoned also in Pisidia or Phrygia as well as Lycaonia,<br>
 Phrygian in population and distinguished by Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 14:6)</i></b> from<br>
 Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia. As compared with Antioch <b><i>(a<br>
 Roman colony)</i></b> it was a native Phrygian town. When the province of<br>
 Galatia was divided, Iconium became the capital of Lycaonia and<br>
 eclipsed Antioch in Pisidia. Strictly speaking at this time<br>
 Lystra and Derbe were cities of Lycaonia-Galatica while Iconium<br>
 was in Phrygia-Galatica <b><i>(all three in the Roman Province of<br>
 Galatia)</i></b>. It was at the meeting place of several Roman roads and<br>
 on the highway from east to west. It is still a large town Konieh<br>
 with 30,000 population.<br>
 <br>
 13:52 <B>{And the disciples}</B> <b><i>(\hoi te\ or \hoi de math&#275;tai\)</i></b>. The<br>
 Gentile Christians in Antioch in Pisidia. Persecution had<br>
 precisely the opposite effect to the intention of the Jews for<br>
 they "were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit" <b><i>(\epl&#275;rounto<br>
 charas kai pneumatos hagiou\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive, they kept on<br>
 being filled. It had been so before <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 4:31; 8:4; 9:31;<br>
 12:24)</i></b>. The blood of the martyrs is still the seed of the<br>
 church.<br>
