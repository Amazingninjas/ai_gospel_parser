<p>2:1 <B>{Not with excellency of speech or of wisdom}</B> <b><i>(\ou kath'<br>
 huperoch&#275;n logou &#275; sophias\)</i></b>. \Huperoch&#275;\ is an old word from the<br>
 verb \huperech&#333;\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 4:7)</i></b> and means preeminence, rising above.<br>
 In N.T. only here and <!-#-->1Ti 2:2 of magistrates. It occurs in<br>
 inscriptions of Pergamum for persons of position <b><i>(Deissmann,<br>
 _Bible Studies_, p. 255)</i></b>. Here it means excess or superfluity,<br>
 "not in excellence of rhetorical display or of philosophical<br>
 subtlety" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. <B>{The mystery of God}</B> <b><i>(\to must&#275;rion tou<br>
 theou\)</i></b>. So Aleph A C Copt. like <!-#-->2:7, but B D L P read<br>
 \marturion\ like <!-#-->1:6. Probably <B>{mystery}</B> is correct. Christ<br>
 crucified is the mystery of God <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 2:2)</i></b>. Paul did not<br>
 hesitate to appropriate this word in common use among the mystery<br>
 religions, but he puts into it his ideas, not those in current<br>
 use. It is an old word from \mue&#333;\, to close, to shut, to<br>
 initiate <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 4:12)</i></b>. This mystery was once hidden from the ages<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 1:26)</i></b>, but is now made plain in Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 2:7; Ro<br>
 16:25f.)</i></b>. The papyri give many illustrations of the use of the<br>
 word for secret doctrines known only to the initiated <b><i>(Moulton<br>
 and Milligan's _Vocabulary_)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:2 <B>{For I determined not to know anything among you}</B> <b><i>(\ou gar<br>
 ekrina ti eidenai en humin\)</i></b>. Literally, "For I did not decide to<br>
 know anything among you." The negative goes with \ekrina\, not<br>
 with \ti\. Paul means that he did not think it fit or his<br>
 business to know anything for his message beyond this "mystery of<br>
 God." <B>{Save Jesus Christ}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275; I&#275;soun Christon\)</i></b>. Both the<br>
 person and the office <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. I had no intent to go beyond<br>
 him and in particular, <B>{and him crucified}</B> <b><i>(\kai touton<br>
 estaur&#333;menon\)</i></b>. Literally, <B>{and this one as crucified}</B> <b><i>(perfect<br>
 passive participle)</i></b>. This phase in particular <b><i>(<!-#-->1:18)</i></b> was<br>
 selected by Paul from the start as the centre of his gospel<br>
 message. He decided to stick to it even after Athens where he was<br>
 practically laughed out of court. The Cross added to the<br>
 \scandalon\ of the Incarnation, but Paul kept to the main track<br>
 on coming to Corinth.<br>
 <br>
 2:3 <B>{I was with you}</B> <b><i>(\egenom&#275;n pros humas\)</i></b>. Rather, "I came to<br>
 you" <b><i>(not \&#275;n\, was)</i></b>. "I not only eschewed all affectation of<br>
 cleverness or grandiloquence, but I went to the opposite extreme<br>
 of diffidence and nervous self-effacement" <b><i>(Robertson and<br>
 Plummer)</i></b>. Paul had been in prison in Philippi, driven out of<br>
 Thessalonica and Beroea, politely bowed out of Athens. It is a<br>
 human touch to see this shrinking as he faced the hard conditions<br>
 in Corinth. It is a common feeling of the most effective<br>
 preachers. Cool complacency is not the mood of the finest<br>
 preaching. See \phobos\ <b><i>(fear)</i></b> and \tromos\ <b><i>(trembling)</i></b> combined<br>
 in <!-#-->2Co 7:15; Php 2:12; Eph 6:5.<br>
 <br>
 2:4 <B>{Not in persuasive words of wisdom}</B> <b><i>(\ouk en pithois sophias<br>
 logois\)</i></b>. This looks like a false disclaimer or mock modesty, for<br>
 surely the preacher desires to be persuasive. This adjective<br>
 \pithos\ <b><i>(MSS. \peithos\)</i></b> has not yet been found elsewhere. It<br>
 seems to be formed directly from \peith&#333;\, to persuade, as<br>
 \pheidos\ <b><i>(\phidos\)</i></b> is from \pheidomai\, to spare. The old Greek<br>
 form \pithanos\ is common enough and is used by Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_.<br>
 VIII. 9. 1)</i></b> of "the plausible words of the lying prophet" in <!-#-->1Ki<br>
 13. The kindred word \pithanologia\ occurs in <!-#-->Col 2:4 for the<br>
 specious and plausible Gnostic philosophers. And gullible people<br>
 are easy marks for these plausible pulpiteers. Corinth put a<br>
 premium on the veneer of false rhetoric and thin thinking. <B>{But<br>
 in demonstration}</B> <b><i>(\all' en apodeixei\)</i></b>. In contrast with the<br>
 <B>{plausibility}</B> just mentioned. This word, though an old one from<br>
 \apodeiknumi\, to show forth, occurs nowhere else in the New<br>
 Testament. <B>{Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\pneuma\)</i></b> here can be the Holy Spirit or<br>
 inward spirit as opposed to superficial expression and <B>{power}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dunamis\)</i></b> is moral power rather than intellectual acuteness<br>
 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1:18)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:5 <B>{That your faith should not stand}</B> <b><i>(\hina h&#275; pistis hum&#333;n m&#275;<br>
 &#275;i\)</i></b>. Purpose of God, but \m&#275; &#275;i\ is "not be" merely. The only<br>
 secure place for faith to find a rest is in God's power, not in<br>
 the wisdom of men. One has only to instance the changing theories<br>
 of men about science, philosophy, religion, politics to see this.<br>
 A sure word from God can be depended on.<br>
 <br>
 2:6 <B>{Among the perfect}</B> <b><i>(\en tois teleiois\)</i></b>. Paul is not here<br>
 drawing a distinction between exoteric and esoteric wisdom as the<br>
 Gnostics did for their initiates, but simply to the necessary<br>
 difference in teaching for babes <b><i>(<!-#-->3:1)</i></b> and adults or grown men<br>
 <b><i>(common use of \teleios\ for relative perfection, for adults, as<br>
 is in <!-#-->1Co 14:20; Php 3:15; Eph 4:13; Heb 5:14)</i></b>. Some were<br>
 simply old babes and unable in spite of their years to digest<br>
 solid spiritual food, "the ample teaching as to the Person of<br>
 Christ and the eternal purpose of God. Such 'wisdom' we have in<br>
 the Epistles to the Ephesians and the Colossians especially, and<br>
 in a less degree in the Epistle to the Romans. This 'wisdom' is<br>
 discerned in the Gospel of John, as compared with the other<br>
 Evangelists" <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. These imperfect disciples Paul wishes<br>
 to develop into spiritual maturity. <B>{Of this world}</B> <b><i>(\tou ai&#333;nos<br>
 toutou\)</i></b>. This age, more exactly, as in <!-#-->1:20. This wisdom does<br>
 not belong to the passing age of fleeting things, but to the<br>
 enduring and eternal <b><i>(Ellicott)</i></b>. <B>{Which are coming to naught}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\t&#333;n katargoumen&#333;n\)</i></b>. See on &#175;1:28. Present passive participle<br>
 genitive plural of \katarge&#333;\. The gradual nullification of these<br>
 "rulers" before the final and certain triumph of the power of<br>
 Christ in his kingdom.<br>
 <br>
 2:7 <B>{God's wisdom in a mystery}</B> <b><i>(\theou sophian en must&#275;ri&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Two points are here sharply made. It is God's wisdom <b><i>(note<br>
 emphatic position of the genitive \theou\)</i></b> in contrast to the<br>
 wisdom of this age. Every age of the world has a conceit of its<br>
 own and it is particularly true of this twentieth century, but<br>
 God's wisdom is eternal and superior to the wisdom of any age or<br>
 time. God's wisdom is alone absolute. See on &#175;2:1 for mystery.<br>
 It is not certain whether <B>{in a mystery}</B> is to be taken with<br>
 <B>{wisdom}</B> or <B>{we speak}</B>. The result does not differ greatly,<br>
 probably with <B>{wisdom}</B>, so long a secret and now at last revealed<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 1:26; 2Th 2:7)</i></b>. <B>{That hath been hidden}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n<br>
 apokekrummen&#275;n\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ro 16:25; Col 1:26; Eph 3:5. Articular<br>
 perfect passive participle of \apokrupt&#333;\, more precisely<br>
 defining the indefinite \sophian\ <b><i>(wisdom)</i></b>. <B>{Foreordained before<br>
 the worlds}</B> <b><i>(\pro&#333;risen pro t&#333;n ai&#333;n&#333;n\)</i></b>. This relative clause<br>
 <b><i>(\h&#275;n\)</i></b> defines still more closely God's wisdom. Note \pro\ with<br>
 both verb and substantive <b><i>(\ai&#333;n&#333;n\)</i></b>. Constative aorist of God's<br>
 elective purpose as shown in Christ crucified <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 1:18-24)</i></b>.<br>
 "It was no afterthought or change of plan" <b><i>(Robertson and<br>
 Plummer)</i></b>. <B>{Unto our glory}</B> <b><i>(\eis doxan h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. "The glory of<br>
 inward enlightenment as well as of outward exaltation"<br>
 <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:8 <B>{Knoweth}</B> <b><i>(\egn&#333;ken\)</i></b>. Has known, has discerned, perfect<br>
 active indicative of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\. They have shown amazing ignorance<br>
 of God's wisdom. <B>{For had they known it}</B> <b><i>(\ei gar egn&#333;san\)</i></b>.<br>
 Condition of the second class, determined as unfulfilled, with<br>
 aorist active indicative in both condition <b><i>(\egn&#333;san\)</i></b> and<br>
 conclusion with \an\ <b><i>(\ouk an estaur&#333;san\)</i></b>. Peter in the great<br>
 sermon at Pentecost commented on the "ignorance" <b><i>(\kata agnoian\)</i></b><br>
 of the Jews in crucifying Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 3:17)</i></b> as the only hope for<br>
 repentance on their part <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 3:19)</i></b>. <B>{The Lord of glory}</B> <b><i>(\ton<br>
 Kurion t&#275;s dox&#275;s\)</i></b>. Genitive case \dox&#275;s\, means characterized by<br>
 glory, "bringing out the contrast between the indignity of the<br>
 Cross <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 12:2)</i></b> and the majesty of the Victim <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:69;<br>
 23:43)</i></b>" <b><i>(Robertson and Plummer)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Jas 2:1; Ac 7:2; Eph 1:17;<br>
 Heb 9:5.<br>
 <br>
 2:9 <B>{But as it is written}</B> <b><i>(\alla kath&#333;s gegraptai\)</i></b>. Elliptical<br>
 sentence like <!-#-->Rom 15:3 where \gegonen\ <b><i>(it has happened)</i></b> can be<br>
 supplied. It is not certain where Paul derives this quotation as<br>
 Scripture. Origen thought it a quotation from the _Apocalypse of<br>
 Elias_ and Jerome finds it also in the _Ascension of Isaiah_. But<br>
 these books appear to be post-Pauline, and Jerome denies that<br>
 Paul obtained it from these late apocryphal books. Clement of<br>
 Rome finds it in the LXX text of <!-#-->Isa 64:4 and cites it as a<br>
 Christian saying. It is likely that Paul here combines freely<br>
 <!-#-->Isa 64:4; 65:17; 52:15 in a sort of catena or free chain of<br>
 quotations as he does in <!-#-->Ro 3:10-18. There is also an<br>
 anacoluthon for \ha\ <b><i>(which things)</i></b> occurs as the direct object<br>
 <b><i>(accusative)</i></b> with \eiden\ <b><i>(saw)</i></b> and \&#275;kousan\ <b><i>(heard)</i></b>, but as the<br>
 subject <b><i>(nominative)</i></b> with \aneb&#275;\ <b><i>(entered, second aorist active<br>
 indicative of \anabain&#333;\, to go up)</i></b>. <B>{Whatsoever}</B> <b><i>(\hosa\)</i></b>. A<br>
 climax to the preceding relative clause <b><i>(Findlay)</i></b>. <B>{Prepared}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\h&#275;toimasen\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of \hetoimaz&#333;\.<br>
 The only instance where Paul uses this verb of God, though it<br>
 occurs of final glory <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:31; Mt 20:23; 25:34; Mr 10:40; Heb<br>
 11:16)</i></b> and of final misery <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 25:41)</i></b>. But here undoubtedly<br>
 the dominant idea is the present blessing to these who love God<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 1:5-7)</i></b>. <B>{Heart}</B> <b><i>(\kardian\)</i></b> here as in <!-#-->Ro 1:21 is more<br>
 than emotion. The Gnostics used this passage to support their<br>
 teaching of esoteric doctrine as Hegesippus shows. Lightfoot<br>
 thinks that probably the apocryphal _Ascension of Isaiah_ and<br>
 _Apocalypse of Elias_ were Gnostic and so quoted this passage of<br>
 Paul to support their position. But the next verse shows that<br>
 Paul uses it of what is now <B>{revealed}</B> and made plain, not of<br>
 mysteries still unknown.<br>
 <br>
 2:10 <B>{But unto us God revealed them}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;min gar apekalupsen ho<br>
 theos\)</i></b>. So with \gar\ B 37 Sah Cop read instead of \de\ of Aleph<br>
 A C D. "\De\ is superficially easier; \gar\ intrinsically better"<br>
 <b><i>(Findlay)</i></b>. Paul explains why this is no longer hidden, "for God<br>
 revealed unto us" the wonders of grace pictured in verse <!-#-->9. We<br>
 do not have to wait for heaven to see them. Hence we can utter<br>
 those things hidden from the eye, the ear, the heart of man. This<br>
 revelation <b><i>(\apekalupsen\, first aorist active indicative)</i></b> took<br>
 place, at "the entry of the Gospel into the world," not "when we<br>
 were admitted into the Church, when we were baptized" as<br>
 Lightfoot interprets it. <B>{Through the Spirit}</B> <b><i>(\dia tou<br>
 pneumatos\)</i></b>. The Holy Spirit is the agent of this definite<br>
 revelation of grace, a revelation with a definite beginning or<br>
 advent <b><i>(constative aorist)</i></b>, an unveiling by the Spirit where<br>
 "human ability and research would not have sufficed" <b><i>(Robertson<br>
 and Plummer)</i></b>, "according to the revelation of the mystery" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro<br>
 16:25)</i></b>, "the revelation given to Christians as an event that<br>
 began a new epoch in the world's history" <b><i>(Edwards)</i></b>. <B>{Searcheth<br>
 all things}</B> <b><i>(\panta eraun&#257;i\)</i></b>. This is the usual form from A.D. 1<br>
 on rather than the old \ereuna&#333;\. The word occurs <b><i>(Moulton and<br>
 Milligan's _Vocabulary_)</i></b> for a professional searcher's report and<br>
 \eraun&#275;tai\, searchers for customs officials. "The Spirit is the<br>
 organ of understanding between man and God" <b><i>(Findlay)</i></b>. So in <!-#-->Ro<br>
 8:27 we have this very verb \erauna&#333;\ again of God's searching<br>
 our hearts. The Holy Spirit not merely investigates us, but he<br>
 searches "even the deep things of God" <b><i>(\kai ta bath&#275; tou<br>
 theou\)</i></b>. _Profunda Dei_ <b><i>(Vulgate)</i></b>. Cf. "the deep things of Satan"<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 2:24)</i></b> and Paul's language in <!-#-->Ro 11:33 "Oh the depth of<br>
 the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God." Paul's point is<br>
 simply that the Holy Spirit fully comprehends the depth of God's<br>
 nature and his plans of grace and so is fully competent to make<br>
 the revelation here claimed.<br>
 <br>
 2:11 <B>{Knoweth}</B> <b><i>(\oiden, egn&#333;ken\)</i></b>. Second perfect of root \id-\,<br>
 to see and so know, first perfect of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\, to know by<br>
 personal experience, has come to know and still knows. See First<br>
 John for a clear distinction in the use of \oida\ and \gin&#333;sk&#333;\.<br>
 <B>{The spirit of man that is in him}</B> <b><i>(\to pneuma tou anthr&#333;pou to<br>
 en aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. The self-consciousness of man that resides in the man<br>
 or woman <b><i>(generic term for mankind, \anthr&#333;pos\)</i></b>. <B>{The Spirit of<br>
 God}</B> <b><i>(\to pneuma tou theou\)</i></b>. Note the absence of \to en aut&#333;i\.<br>
 It is not the mere self-consciousness of God, but the personal<br>
 Holy Spirit in his relation to God the Father. Paul's analogy<br>
 between the spirit of man and the Spirit of God does not hold<br>
 clear through and he guards it at this vital point as he does<br>
 elsewhere as in <!-#-->Ro 8:26 and in the full Trinitarian benediction<br>
 in <!-#-->2Co 13:13. \Pneuma\ in itself merely means breath or wind as<br>
 in <!-#-->Joh 3:8. To know accurately Paul's use of the word in every<br>
 instance calls for an adequate knowledge of his theology, and<br>
 psychology. But the point here is plain. God's Holy Spirit is<br>
 amply qualified to make the revelation claimed here in verses<br>
 <!-#-->6-10.<br>
 <br>
 2:12 <B>{But we}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meis de\)</i></b>. We Christians like <B>{us}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;min\)</i></b> in<br>
 verse <!-#-->10 of the revelation, but particularly Paul and the other<br>
 apostles. <B>{Received}</B> <b><i>(\elabomen\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative of \lamban&#333;\ and so a definite event, though the<br>
 constative aorist may include various stages. <B>{Not the spirit of<br>
 the world}</B> <b><i>(\ou to pneuma tou kosmou\)</i></b>. Probably a reference to<br>
 the wisdom of this age in verse <!-#-->6. See also <!-#-->Ro 8:4,6,7; 1Co<br>
 11:4 <b><i>(\the pneuma heteron\)</i></b>. <B>{But the spirit which is of God}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\alla to pneuma to ek theou\)</i></b>. Rather, "from God" <b><i>(\ek\)</i></b>, which<br>
 proceeds from God. <B>{That we might know}</B> <b><i>(\hina eid&#333;men\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 perfect subjunctive with \hina\ to express purpose. Here is a<br>
 distinct claim of the Holy Spirit for understanding<br>
 <b><i>(Illumination)</i></b> the Revelation received. It is not a senseless<br>
 rhapsody or secret mystery, but God expects us to understand "the<br>
 things that are freely given us by God" <b><i>(\ta hupo tou theou<br>
 charisthenta h&#275;min\)</i></b>. First aorist passive neuter plural<br>
 articular participle of \charizomai\, to bestow. God gave the<br>
 revelation through the Holy Spirit and he gives us the<br>
 illumination of the Holy Spirit to understand the mind of the<br>
 Spirit. The tragic failures of men to understand clearly God's<br>
 revealed will is but a commentary on the weakness and limitation<br>
 of the human intellect even when enlightened by the Holy Spirit.<br>
 <br>
 2:13 <B>{Which things also we speak}</B> <b><i>(\ha kai laloumen\)</i></b>. This<br>
 onomatopoetic verb \lale&#333;\ <b><i>(from \la-la\)</i></b>, to utter sounds. In<br>
 the papyri the word calls more attention to the form of utterance<br>
 while \leg&#333;\ refers more to the substance. But \lale&#333;\ in the<br>
 N.T. as here is used of the highest and holiest speech.<br>
 Undoubtedly Paul employs the word purposely for the utterance of<br>
 the revelation which he has understood. That is to say, there is<br>
 revelation <b><i>(verse <!-#-->10)</i></b>, illumination <b><i>(verse <!-#-->12)</i></b>, and<br>
 inspiration <b><i>(verse <!-#-->13)</i></b>. Paul claims therefore the help of the<br>
 Holy Spirit for the reception of the revelation, for the<br>
 understanding of it, for the expression of it. Paul claimed this<br>
 authority for his preaching <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 4:2)</i></b> and for his epistles<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Th 3:14)</i></b>. <B>{Not in words which man's wisdom teacheth}</B> <b><i>(\ouk en<br>
 didaktois anthr&#333;pin&#275;s sophias logois\)</i></b>. Literally, "not in words<br>
 taught by human wisdom." The verbal adjective \didaktois\ <b><i>(from<br>
 \didask&#333;\, to teach)</i></b> is here passive in idea and is followed by<br>
 the ablative case of origin or source as in <!-#-->Joh 6:45, \esontai<br>
 pantes didaktoi theou\ <b><i>(from <!-#-->Isa 54:13)</i></b>, "They shall all be<br>
 taught by God." The ablative in Greek, as is well known, has the<br>
 same form as the genitive, though quite different in idea<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 516)</i></b>. So then Paul claims the help of<br>
 the Holy Spirit in the utterance <b><i>(\laloumen\)</i></b> of the words,<br>
 "which the Spirit teacheth <b><i>(\en didaktois pneumatos\)</i></b>, "in words<br>
 taught by the Spirit" <b><i>(ablative \pneumatos\ as above)</i></b>. Clearly<br>
 Paul means that the help of the Holy Spirit in the utterance of<br>
 the revelation extends to the words. No theory of inspiration is<br>
 here stated, but it is not _mere_ human wisdom. Paul's own<br>
 Epistles bear eloquent witness to the lofty claim here made. They<br>
 remain today after nearly nineteen centuries throbbing with the<br>
 power of the Spirit of God, dynamic with life for the problems of<br>
 today as when Paul wrote them for the needs of the believers in<br>
 his time, the greatest epistles of all time, surcharged with the<br>
 energy of God. <B>{Comparing spiritual things with spiritual}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pneumatikois pneumatika sunkrinontes\)</i></b>. Each of these words is<br>
 in dispute. The verb \sunkrin&#333;\, originally meant to combine, to<br>
 join together fitly. In the LXX it means to interpret dreams <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge<br>
 40:8,22; 41:12)</i></b> possibly by comparison. In the later Greek it<br>
 may mean to compare as in <!-#-->2Co 10:12. In the papyri Moulton and<br>
 Milligan <b><i>(_Vocabulary_)</i></b> give it only for "decide," probably after<br>
 comparing. But "comparing," in spite of the translations, does<br>
 not suit well here. So it is best to follow the original meaning<br>
 to combine as do Lightfoot and Ellicott. But what gender is<br>
 \pneumatikois\? Is it masculine or neuter like \pneumatika\? If<br>
 masculine, the idea would be "interpreting <b><i>(like LXX)</i></b> spiritual<br>
 truths to spiritual persons" or "matching spiritual truths with<br>
 spiritual persons." This is a possible rendering and makes good<br>
 sense in harmony with verse <!-#-->14. If \pneumatikois\ be taken as<br>
 neuter plural <b><i>(associative instrumental case after \sun\ in<br>
 \sunkrinontes\)</i></b>, the idea most naturally would be, "combining<br>
 spiritual ideas <b><i>(\pneumatika\)</i></b> with spiritual words"<br>
 <b><i>(\pneumatikois\)</i></b>. This again makes good sense in harmony with the<br>
 first part of verse <!-#-->13. On the whole this is the most natural<br>
 way to take it, though various other possibilities exist.<br>
 <br>
 2:14 <B>{Now the natural man}</B> <b><i>(\psuchikos de anthr&#333;pos\)</i></b>. Note<br>
 absence of article here, "A natural man" <b><i>(an unregenerate man)</i></b>.<br>
 Paul does not employ modern psychological terms and he exercises<br>
 variety in his use of all the terms here present as \pneuma\ and<br>
 \pneumatikos, psuch&#275;\ and \psuchikos, sarx\ and \sarkinos\ and<br>
 \sarkikos\. A helpful discussion of the various uses of these<br>
 words in the New Testament is given by Burton in his _New<br>
 Testament Word Studies_, pp. 62-68, and in his <B>{Spirit, Soul, and<br>
 Flesh}</B>. The papyri furnish so many examples of \sarx, pneuma\,<br>
 and \psuch&#275;\ that Moulton and Milligan make no attempt at an<br>
 exhaustive treatment, but give a few miscellaneous examples to<br>
 illustrate the varied uses that parallel the New Testament.<br>
 \Psuchikos\ is a qualitative adjective from \psuch&#275;\ <b><i>(breath of<br>
 life like \anima\, life, soul)</i></b>. Here the Vulgate renders it by<br>
 _animalis_ and the German by _sinnlich_, the original sense of<br>
 animal life as in <!-#-->Jude 1:19; Jas 3:15. In <!-#-->1Co 15:44,46 there<br>
 is the same contrast between \psuchikos\ and \pneumatikos\ as<br>
 here. The \psuchikos\ man is the unregenerate man while the<br>
 \pneumatikos\ man is the renewed man, born again of the Spirit of<br>
 God. <B>{Receiveth not}</B> <b><i>(\ou dechetai\)</i></b>. Does not accept, rejects,<br>
 refuses to accept. In <!-#-->Ro 8:7 Paul definitely states the<br>
 inability <b><i>(\oude gar dunatai\)</i></b> of the mind of the flesh to<br>
 receive the things of the Spirit untouched by the Holy Spirit.<br>
 Certainly the initiative comes from God whose Holy Spirit makes<br>
 it possible for us to accept the things of the Spirit of God.<br>
 They are no longer "foolishness" <b><i>(\m&#333;ria\)</i></b> to us as was once the<br>
 case <b><i>(<!-#-->1:23)</i></b>. Today one notes certain of the _intelligentsia_<br>
 who sneer at Christ and Christianity in their own blinded<br>
 ignorance. <B>{He cannot know them}</B> <b><i>(\ou dunatai gn&#333;nai\)</i></b>. He is not<br>
 able to get a knowledge <b><i>(ingressive second aorist active<br>
 infinitive of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b>. His helpless condition calls for pity<br>
 in place of impatience on our part, though such an one usually<br>
 poses as a paragon of wisdom and commiserates the deluded<br>
 followers of Christ. <B>{They are spiritually judged}</B> <b><i>(\pneumatik&#333;s<br>
 anakrinetai\)</i></b>. Paul and Luke are fond of this verb, though<br>
 nowhere else in the N.T. Paul uses it only in I Corinthians. The<br>
 word means a sifting process to get at the truth by investigation<br>
 as of a judge. In <!-#-->Ac 17:11 the Beroeans scrutinized the<br>
 Scriptures. These \psuchikoi\ men are incapable of rendering a<br>
 decision for they are unable to recognize the facts. They judge<br>
 by the \psuch&#275;\ <b><i>(mere animal nature)</i></b> rather than by the \pneuma\<br>
 <b><i>(the renewed spirit)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:15 <B>{Judgeth all things}</B> <b><i>(\anakrinei panta\)</i></b>. The spiritual man<br>
 <b><i>(\ho pneumatikos\)</i></b> is qualified to sift, to examine, to decide<br>
 rightly, because he has the eyes of his heart enlightened <b><i>(<!-#-->Eph<br>
 1:18)</i></b> and is no longer blinded by the god of this world <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co<br>
 4:4)</i></b>. There is a great lesson for Christians who know by<br>
 personal experience the things of the Spirit of God. Men of<br>
 intellectual gifts who are ignorant of the things of Christ talk<br>
 learnedly and patronizingly about things of which they are<br>
 grossly ignorant. The spiritual man is superior to all this false<br>
 knowledge. <B>{He himself is judged of no man}</B> <b><i>(\autos de hup'<br>
 oudenos anakrinetai\)</i></b>. Men will pass judgment on him, but the<br>
 spiritual man refuses to accept the decision of his ignorant<br>
 judges. He stands superior to them all as Polycarp did when he<br>
 preferred to be burnt to saying, "Lord Caesar" in place of "Lord<br>
 Jesus." He was unwilling to save his earthly life by the worship<br>
 of Caesar in place of the Lord Jesus. Polycarp was a<br>
 \pneumatikos\ man.<br>
 <br>
 2:16 <B>{For who hath known the mind of the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\Tis gar egn&#333;<br>
 noun Kuriou;\)</i></b>. Quotation from <!-#-->Isa 40:13. <B>{That he should<br>
 instruct him}</B> <b><i>(\hos sunbibasei auton\)</i></b>. This use of \hos\<br>
 <b><i>(relative <B>{who}</B>)</i></b> is almost consecutive <b><i>(result)</i></b>. The<br>
 \pneumatikos\ man is superior to others who attempt even to<br>
 instruct God himself. See on &#175;Ac 9:22; 16:10 for \sunbibaz&#333;\, to<br>
 make go together. <B>{But we have the mind of Christ}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;meis de<br>
 noun Christou echomen\)</i></b>. As he has already shown <b><i>(verses <!-#-->6-13)</i></b>.<br>
 Thus with the mind <b><i>(\nous\. Cf. <!-#-->Php 2:5; Ro 8:9,27)</i></b>. Hence Paul<br>
 and all \pneumatikoi\ men are superior to those who try to shake<br>
 their faith in Christ, the mystery of God. Paul can say, "I know<br>
 him whom I have believed." "I believe; therefore I have spoken."<br>
