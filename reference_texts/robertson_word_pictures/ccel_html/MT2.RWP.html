<p>2:1 <B>{Now when Jesus was born}</B> <b><i>(\tou de I&#275;sou genn&#275;thentos\)</i></b>. The<br>
 fact of the birth of Jesus is stated by the genitive absolute<br>
 construction <b><i>(first aorist passive participle of the same verb<br>
 \genna&#333;\ used twice already of the birth of Jesus, <!-#-->1:16,20, and<br>
 used in the genealogy, <!-#-->1:2-16)</i></b>. Matthew does not propose to<br>
 give biographic details of the supernatural birth of Jesus,<br>
 wonderful as it was and disbelieved as it is by some today who<br>
 actually deny that Jesus was born at all or ever lived, men who<br>
 talk of the Jesus Myth, the Christ Myth, etc. "The main purpose<br>
 is to show the reception given by the world to the new-born<br>
 Messianic King. Homage from afar, hostility at home;<br>
 foreshadowing the fortunes of the new faith: reception by the<br>
 Gentiles, rejection by the Jews" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{In Bethlehem of Judea}</B> <b><i>(\en B&#275;thleem t&#275;s Ioudaias\)</i></b>. There was a<br>
 Bethlehem in Galilee seven miles northwest of Nazareth <b><i>(Josephus,<br>
 _Antiquities_ XIX. 15)</i></b>. This Bethlehem <b><i>(house of bread, the name<br>
 means)</i></b> of Judah was the scene of Ruth's life with Boaz <b><i>(<!-#-->Ru<br>
 1:1f.; Mt. 1:5)</i></b> and the home of David, descendant of Ruth and<br>
 ancestor of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt. 1:5)</i></b>. David was born here and anointed<br>
 king by Samuel <b><i>(<!-#-->1Sa 17:12)</i></b>. The town came to be called the city<br>
 of David <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 2:11)</i></b>. Jesus, who was born in this House of Bread<br>
 called himself the Bread of Life <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:35)</i></b>, the true Manna<br>
 from heaven. Matthew assumes the knowledge of the details of the<br>
 birth of Jesus in Bethlehem which are given in <!-#-->Lu 2:1-7 or did<br>
 not consider them germane to his purpose. Joseph and Mary went to<br>
 Bethlehem from Nazareth because it was the original family home<br>
 for both of them. The first enrolment by the Emperor Augustus as<br>
 the papyri show was by families <b><i>(\kat' oikian\)</i></b>. Possibly Joseph<br>
 had delayed the journey for some reason till now it approached<br>
 the time for the birth of the child.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{In the days of Herod the King}</B> <b><i>(\en h&#275;merais H&#275;r&#333;idou tou<br>
 Basile&#333;s\)</i></b>. This is the only date for the birth of Christ given<br>
 by Matthew. Luke gives a more precise date in his Gospel <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 2:1-3)</i></b>, the time of the first enrolment by Augustus and while<br>
 Cyrenius was ruler of Syria. More will be said of Luke's date<br>
 when we come to his Gospel. We know from Matthew that Jesus was<br>
 born while Herod was king, the Herod sometimes called Herod the<br>
 Great. Josephus makes it plain that Herod died B.C. 4. He was<br>
 first Governor of Galilee, but had been king of Judaea since B.C.<br>
 40 <b><i>(by Antony and Octavius)</i></b>. I call him "Herod the Great Pervert"<br>
 in _Some Minor Characters in the New Testament_. He was great in<br>
 sin and in cruelty and had won the favour of the Emperor. The<br>
 story in Josephus is a tragedy. It is not made plain by Matthew<br>
 how long before the death of Herod Jesus was born. Our<br>
 traditional date A.D. 1, is certainly wrong as Matthew shows. It<br>
 seems plain that the birth of Jesus cannot be put later than B.C.<br>
 5. The data supplied by Luke probably call for B.C. 6 or 7.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Wise men from the east}</B> <b><i>(\magoi apo anatol&#333;n\)</i></b>. The etymology of<br>
 \Magi\ is quite uncertain. It may come from the same<br>
 Indo-European root as _<b><i>(megas)</i></b> magnus_,  though some find it of<br>
 Babylonian origin. Herodotus speaks of a tribe of Magi among the<br>
 Medians. Among the Persians there was a priestly caste of Magi<br>
 like the Chaldeans in Babylon <b><i>(<!-#-->Da 1:4)</i></b>. Daniel was head of such<br>
 an order <b><i>(<!-#-->Da 2:48)</i></b>. It is the same word as our "magician" and<br>
 it sometimes carried that idea as in the case of Simon Magus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 8:9,11)</i></b> and of Elymas Barjesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 13:6,8)</i></b>. But here in<br>
 Matthew the idea seems to be rather that of astrologers. Babylon<br>
 was the home of astrology, but we only know that the men were<br>
 from the east whether Arabia, Babylon, Persia, or elsewhere. The<br>
 notion that they were kings arose from an interpretation of <!-#-->Is<br>
 60:3; Re 21:24. The idea that they were three in number is due<br>
 to the mention of three kinds of gifts <b><i>(gold, frankincense,<br>
 myrrh)</i></b>, but that is no proof at all. Legend has added to the<br>
 story that the names were Caspar, Balthasar, and Melchior as in<br>
 _Ben Hur_ and also that they represent Shem, Ham, and Japhet. A<br>
 casket in the Cologne Cathedral actually is supposed to contain<br>
 the skulls of these three Magi. The word for east <b><i>(\apo<br>
 anatol&#333;n\)</i></b> means "from the risings" of the sun.<br>
 <br>
 2:2 <B>{For we saw his star in the east}</B> <b><i>(\eidomen gar autou ton<br>
 astera en t&#275;i anatol&#275;i\)</i></b>. This does not mean that they saw the<br>
 star which was in the east. That would make them go east to<br>
 follow it instead of west from the east. The words "in the east"<br>
 are probably to be taken with "we saw" i.e. we were in the east<br>
 when we saw it, or still more probably "we saw his star at its<br>
 rising" or "when it rose" as Moffatt puts it. The singular form<br>
 here <b><i>(\t&#275;i anatol&#275;i\)</i></b> does sometimes mean "east" <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 21:13)</i></b>,<br>
 though the plural is more common as in <!-#-->Mt 2:1. In <!-#-->Lu 1:78 the<br>
 singular means dawn as the verb <b><i>(\aneteilen\)</i></b> does in <!-#-->Mt 4:16<br>
 <b><i>(Septuagint)</i></b>. The Magi ask where is the one born king of the<br>
 Jews. They claim that they had seen his star, either a miracle or<br>
 a combination of bright stars or a comet. These men may have been<br>
 Jewish proselytes and may have known of the Messianic hope, for<br>
 even Vergil had caught a vision of it. The whole world was on<br>
 tiptoe of expectancy for something. Moulton <b><i>(_Journal of<br>
 Theological Studies_, 1902, p. 524)</i></b> "refers to the Magian belief<br>
 that a star could be the _fravashi_, the counterpart or angel<br>
 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mt 18:10)</i></b> of a great man" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. They came to worship<br>
 the newly born king of the Jews. Seneca <b><i>(_Epistle_ 58)</i></b> tells of<br>
 Magians who came to Athens with sacrifices to Plato after his<br>
 death. They had their own way of concluding that the star which<br>
 they had seen pointed to the birth of this Messianic king. Cicero<br>
 <b><i>(_De Divin_. i. 47)</i></b> "refers to the constellation from which, on<br>
 the birthnight of Alexander, Magians foretold that the destroyer<br>
 of Asia was born" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>. Alford is positive that no miracle<br>
 is intended by the report of the Magi or by Matthew in his<br>
 narrative. But one must be allowed to say that the birth of<br>
 Jesus, if really God's only Son who has become Incarnate, is the<br>
 greatest of all miracles. Even the methods of astrologers need<br>
 not disturb those who are sure of this fact.<br>
 <br>
 2:3 <B>{He was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him}</B> <b><i>(\etarachth&#275;<br>
 kai p&#257;sa Ierosoluma met' autou\)</i></b>. Those familiar with the story<br>
 of Herod the Great in Josephus can well understand the meaning of<br>
 these words. Herod in his rage over his family rivalries and<br>
 jealousies put to death the two sons of Mariamne <b><i>(Aristobulus and<br>
 Alexander)</i></b>, Mariamne herself, and Antipater, another son and once<br>
 his heir, besides the brother and mother of Mariamne<br>
 <b><i>(Aristobulus, Alexandra)</i></b> and her grandfather John Hyrcanus. He<br>
 had made will after will and was now in a fatal illness and fury<br>
 over the question of the Magi. He showed his excitement and the<br>
 whole city was upset because the people knew only too well what<br>
 he could do when in a rage over the disturbance of his plans.<br>
 "The foreigner and usurper feared a rival, and the tyrant feared<br>
 the rival would be welcome" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Herod was a hated Idumaean.<br>
 <br>
 2:4 <B>{He inquired of them where the Christ should be born}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epunthaneto par' aut&#333;n pou ho Christos genn&#257;tai\)</i></b>.  The<br>
 prophetic present <b><i>(\genn&#257;tai\)</i></b> is given, the very words of Herod<br>
 retained by Matthew's report. The imperfect tense <b><i>(epunthaneto)</i></b><br>
 suggests that Herod inquired repeatedly, probably of one and<br>
 another of the leaders gathered together, both Sadducees <b><i>(chief<br>
 priests)</i></b> and Pharisees <b><i>(scribes)</i></b>. McNeile doubts, like Holtzmann,<br>
 if Herod actually called together all the Sanhedrin and probably<br>
 "he could easily ask the question of a single scribe," because he<br>
 had begun his reign with a massacre of the Sanhedrin <b><i>(Josephus,<br>
 _Ant_. XIV. ix. 4)</i></b>. But that was thirty years ago and Herod was<br>
 desperately in earnest to learn what the Jews really expected<br>
 about the coming of "the Messiah." Still Herod probably got<br>
 together not the Sanhedrin since "elders" are not mentioned, but<br>
 leaders among the chief priests and scribes, not a formal meeting<br>
 but a free assembly for conference. He had evidently heard of<br>
 this expected king and he would swallow plenty of pride to be<br>
 able to compass the defeat of these hopes.<br>
 <br>
 2:5 <B>{And they said unto him}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de eipan aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. Whether the<br>
 ecclesiastics had to search their scriptures or not, they give<br>
 the answer that is in accord with the common Jewish opinion that<br>
 the Messiah was to come from Bethlehem and of the seed of David<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 7:42)</i></b>. So they quote <!-#-->Mic 5:2, "a free paraphrase" Alford<br>
 calls it, for it is not precisely like the Hebrew text or like<br>
 the Septuagint. It may have come from a collection of<br>
 _testimonia_ with which J. Rendel Harris has made the world<br>
 familiar. He had consulted the experts and now he has their<br>
 answer. Bethlehem of Judah is the place. The use of the perfect<br>
 passive indicative <b><i>(\gegraptai\)</i></b> is the common form in quoting<br>
 scripture. It stands written. <B>{Shall be shepherd}</B> <b><i>(\poimanei\)</i></b>.<br>
 The Authorized Version had "shall rule," but "shepherd" is<br>
 correct. "Homer calls kings 'the shepherds of the people'"<br>
 <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Heb 13:20 Jesus is called "the great shepherd of<br>
 the sheep." Jesus calls himself "the good shepherd" <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh<br>
 10:11)</i></b>. Peter calls Christ "the chief shepherd" <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 2:25)</i></b>.<br>
 "The Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall be their<br>
 shepherd" <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 7:17)</i></b>. Jesus told Peter to "shepherd" the lambs<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 21:16)</i></b>. Our word pastor means shepherd.<br>
 <br>
 2:7 <B>{Then Herod privily called the wise men}</B> <b><i>(\tote H&#275;r&#333;id&#275;s<br>
 lathrai kalesas tous magous\)</i></b>. He had manifestly not told members<br>
 of the Sanhedrin why he was concerned about the Messiah. So he<br>
 conceals his motives to the Magi. And yet he "learned of them<br>
 carefully" <b><i>(\ekrib&#333;sen\)</i></b>, "learned exactly" or "accurately." He<br>
 was anxious to see if the Jewish prophecy of the birthplace of<br>
 the Messiah agreed with the indications of the star to the Magi.<br>
 He kept to himself his purpose. The time of the appearing star<br>
 <b><i>(\ton chronon tou phainomenou asteros\)</i></b> is not "the time when the<br>
 star appeared," but the age of the star's appearance.<br>
 <br>
 2:8 <B>{Sent them to Bethlehem and said}</B> <b><i>(\pempsas autous eis<br>
 B&#275;thleem eipen\)</i></b>. Simultaneous aorist participle, "sending said."<br>
 They were to "search out accurately" <b><i>(\exetasate akrib&#333;s\)</i></b><br>
 concerning the child. Then "bring me word, that I also may come<br>
 and worship him." The deceit of Herod seemed plausible enough and<br>
 might have succeeded but for God's intervention to protect His<br>
 Son from the jealous rage of Herod.<br>
 <br>
 2:9 <B>{Went before them}</B> <b><i>(\pro&#275;gen autous\)</i></b>. Imperfect tense, kept<br>
 on in front of them, not as a guide to the town since they now<br>
 knew that, but to the place where the child was, the inn<br>
 according to <!-#-->Lu 2:7. Justin Martyr says that it was in a cave.<br>
 The stall where the cattle and donkeys stayed may have been<br>
 beneath the inn in the side of the hill.<br>
 <br>
 2:10 <B>{They rejoiced with exceeding great joy}</B> <b><i>(\echar&#275;san charan<br>
 megal&#275;n sphodra\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive indicative with cognate<br>
 accusative. Their joy was due to the success of the search.<br>
 <br>
 2:11 <B>{Opening their treasures}</B> <b><i>(\anoixantes tous th&#275;saurous<br>
 aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Here "treasures" means "caskets" from the verb<br>
 <b><i>(\tith&#275;mi\)</i></b>, receptacle for valuables. In the ancient writers it<br>
 meant "treasury" as in 1Macc. 3:29. So a "storehouse" as in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 13:52. Then it means the things laid up in store, treasure in<br>
 heaven <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 6:20)</i></b>, in Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->Col 2:3)</i></b>. In their "caskets" the<br>
 Magi had gold, frankincense, and myrrh, all found at that time in<br>
 Arabia, though gold was found in Babylon and elsewhere.<br>
 <br>
 2:12 <B>{Warned in a dream}</B> <b><i>(\chr&#275;matisthentes kat' onar\)</i></b>. The verb<br>
 means to transact business <b><i>(\chr&#275;matiz&#333;\)</i></b> from \chr&#275;ma\, and that<br>
 from \chraomai\, to use. Then to consult, to deliberate, to make<br>
 answer as of magistrates or an oracle, to instruct, to admonish.<br>
 In the Septuagint and the New Testament it occurs with the idea<br>
 of being warned by God and also in the papyri <b><i>(Deissmann, _Bible<br>
 Studies_, p. 122)</i></b>. Wycliff puts it here: "An answer taken in<br>
 sleep."<br>
 <br>
 2:15 <B>{Until the death of Herod}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s t&#275;s teleut&#275;s H&#275;r&#333;idou\)</i></b>.<br>
 The Magi had been warned in a dream not to report to Herod and<br>
 now Joseph was warned in a dream to take Mary and the child along<br>
 <b><i>(\mellei z&#275;tein tou apolesai\ gives a vivid picture of the<br>
 purpose of Herod in these three verbs)</i></b>. In Egypt Joseph was to<br>
 keep Mary and Jesus till the death of Herod the monster. Matthew<br>
 quotes <!-#-->Ho 11:1 to show that this was in fulfilment of God's<br>
 purpose to call his Son out of Egypt. He may have quoted again<br>
 from a collection of _testimonia_ rather than from the<br>
 Septuagint. There is a Jewish tradition in the Talmud that Jesus<br>
 "brought with him magic arts out of Egypt in an incision on his<br>
 body" <b><i>(_Shabb_. 104b)</i></b>. "This attempt to ascribe the Lord's<br>
 miracles to Satanic agency seems to be independent of Matthew,<br>
 and may have been known to him, so that one object of his account<br>
 may have been to combat it" <b><i>(McNeile)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 2:16 <B>{Slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aneilen pantas tous paidas tous en B&#275;thleem\)</i></b>. The flight of<br>
 Joseph was justified, for Herod was violently enraged <b><i>(\ethum&#333;th&#275;<br>
 lian\)</i></b> that he had been mocked by the Magi, deluded in fact<br>
 <b><i>(\enepaichth&#275;\)</i></b>. Vulgate _illusus esset_. Herod did not know, of<br>
 course, how old the child was, but he took no chances and<br>
 included all the little boys <b><i>(\tous paidas\, masculine article)</i></b><br>
 in Bethlehem two years old and under, perhaps fifteen or twenty.<br>
 It is no surprise that Josephus makes no note of this small item<br>
 in Herod's chamber of horrors. It was another fulfilment of the<br>
 prophecy in <!-#-->Jer 31:15. The quotation <b><i>(<!-#-->2:18)</i></b> seems to be from<br>
 the Septuagint. It was originally written of the Babylonian<br>
 captivity but it has a striking illustration in this case also.<br>
 Macrobius <b><i>(_Sat_. II. iv. II)</i></b> notes that Augustus said that it<br>
 was better to be Herod's sow <b><i>(\hus\)</i></b> than his son <b><i>(\huios\)</i></b>, for<br>
 the sow had a better chance of life.<br>
 <br>
 2:20 <B>{For they are dead}</B> <b><i>(\tethn&#275;kasin\)</i></b>.  Only Herod had sought<br>
 to kill the young child, but it is a general statement of a<br>
 particular fact as is common with people who say: "They say." The<br>
 idiom may be suggested by <!-#-->Ex 4:19: "For all are dead that<br>
 sought thy life."<br>
 <br>
 2:22 <B>{Warned in a dream}</B> <b><i>(\chr&#275;matistheis kat' onar\)</i></b>. He was<br>
 already afraid to go to Judea because Archelaus was reigning<br>
 <b><i>(ruling, not technically king, \basileuei\)</i></b>. In a fret at last<br>
 before his death Herod had changed his will again and put<br>
 Archelaus, the worst of his living sons, in the place of Antipas.<br>
 So Joseph went to Galilee. Matthew has had nothing about the<br>
 previous dwelling of Joseph and Mary in Nazareth. We learn that<br>
 from Luke who tells nothing of the flight into Egypt. The two<br>
 narratives supplement one another and are in no sense<br>
 contradictory.<br>
 <br>
 2:23 <B>{Should be called a Nazarene}</B> <b><i>(\Naz&#333;raios kl&#275;th&#275;setai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Matthew says "that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the<br>
 prophets" <b><i>(\dia t&#333;n proph&#275;t&#333;n\)</i></b>. It is the plural and no single<br>
 prophecy exists which says that the Messiah was to be called a<br>
 Nazarene. It may be that this term of contempt <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:46; 7:52)</i></b><br>
 is what is meant, and that several prophecies are to be combined<br>
 like <!-#-->Ps. 22:6,8; 69:11,19; Isa 53:2,3,4. The name Nazareth<br>
 means a shoot or branch, but it is by no means certain that<br>
 Matthew has this in mind. It is best to confess that we do not<br>
 know. See Broadus on Matthew for the various theories. But,<br>
 despised as Nazareth was at that time, Jesus has exalted its<br>
 fame. The lowly Nazarene he was at first, but it is our glory to<br>
 be the followers of the Nazarene. Bruce says that "in this case,<br>
 therefore, we certainly know that the historic fact suggested the<br>
 prophetic reference, instead of the prophecy creating the<br>
 history." The parallels drawn by Matthew between the history of<br>
 Israel and the birth and infancy of Jesus are not mere fancy.<br>
 History repeats itself and writers of history find frequent<br>
 parallels. Surely Matthew is not beyond the bounds of reason or<br>
 of fact in illustrating in his own way the birth and infancy of<br>
 Jesus by the Providence of God in the history of Israel.<br>
