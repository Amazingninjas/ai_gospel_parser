<p>27:1 <B>{That we should sail}</B> <b><i>(\tou apoplein h&#275;mas\)</i></b>. This genitive<br>
 articular infinitive with \ekrith&#275;\ like the LXX construction<br>
 translating the Hebrew infinitive construct is awkward in Greek.<br>
 Several similar examples in <!-#-->Lu 17:1; Ac 10:25; 20:3 <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 1068)</i></b>. Luke alone uses this old verb in N.T. He<br>
 uses nine compounds of \ple&#333;\, to sail. Note the reappearance of<br>
 "we" in the narrative. It is possible, of course, that Luke was<br>
 not with Paul during the series of trials at Caesarea, or at<br>
 least, not all the time. But it is natural for Luke to use "we"<br>
 again because he and Aristarchus are travelling with Paul. In<br>
 Caesarea Paul was the centre of the action all the time whether<br>
 Luke was present or not. The great detail and minute accuracy of<br>
 Luke's account of this voyage and shipwreck throw more light upon<br>
 ancient seafaring than everything else put together. Smith's<br>
 _Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul_ is still a classic on the<br>
 subject. Though so accurate in his use of sea terms, yet Luke<br>
 writes like a landsman, not like a sailor. Besides, the character<br>
 of Paul is here revealed in a remarkable fashion. <B>{They<br>
 delivered}</B> <b><i>(\paredidoun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active \&#333;mega\ form rather<br>
 than the old \-mi\ form \paredidosan\ as in <!-#-->4:33, from<br>
 \paradid&#333;mi\. Perhaps the imperfect notes the continuance of the<br>
 handing over. <B>{Certain other prisoners}</B> <b><i>(\tinas heterous<br>
 desm&#333;tas\)</i></b>. Bound <b><i>(\desm&#333;tas\)</i></b> like Paul, but not necessarily<br>
 appellants to Caesar, perhaps some of them condemned criminals to<br>
 amuse the Roman populace in the gladiatorial shows, most likely<br>
 pagans though \heterous\ does not have to mean different kind of<br>
 prisoners from Paul. <B>{Of the Augustan band}</B> <b><i>(\speir&#275;s Sebast&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Note Ionic genitive \speir&#275;s\, not \speiras\. See on &#175;Mt 27:1; Ac<br>
 10:1. \Cohortis Augustae\. We do not really know why this cohort<br>
 is called "Augustan." It may be that it is part of the imperial<br>
 commissariat <b><i>(_frumentarii_)</i></b> since Julius assumes chief authority<br>
 in the grain ship <b><i>(verse <!-#-->11)</i></b>. These legionary centurions when<br>
 in Rome were called _peregrini_ <b><i>(foreigners)</i></b> because their work<br>
 was chiefly in the provinces. This man Julius may have been one<br>
 of them.<br>
 <br>
 27:2 <B>{In a ship of Adramyttium}</B> <b><i>(\ploi&#333;i Hadramunt&#275;n&#333;i\)</i></b>. A boat<br>
 belonging to Adramyttium, a city in Mysia in the province of<br>
 Asia. Probably a small coasting vessel on its way home for the<br>
 winter stopping at various places <b><i>(\topous\)</i></b>. Julius would take<br>
 his chances to catch another ship for Rome. The usual way to go<br>
 to Rome was to go to Alexandria and so to Rome, but no large ship<br>
 for Alexandria was at hand. <B>{We put to sea}</B> <b><i>(\an&#275;chth&#275;men\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive of \anag&#333;\, usual word in Luke.<br>
 <B>{Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ontos sun h&#275;min Aristarchou Makedonos Thessalonike&#333;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute. Ramsay suggests that Luke and Aristarchus<br>
 accompanied Paul as his slaves since they would not be allowed to<br>
 go as his friends. But Luke was Paul's physician and may have<br>
 gained permission on that score.<br>
 <br>
 27:3 <B>{The next day}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i heter&#257;i\)</i></b>. Locative case with \h&#275;mer&#257;i\<br>
 understood. <B>{We touched}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;chth&#275;men\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 of \katag&#333;\, the usual term for "coming down" from the seas as<br>
 \anag&#333;\ above <b><i>(and verse <!-#-->4)</i></b> is for "going up" to sea. So it<br>
 _looks_ to sailors. Sidon was 67 miles from Caesarea, the rival<br>
 of Tyre, with a splendid harbour. The ship stopped here for<br>
 trade. <B>{Treated Paul kindly}</B> <b><i>(\philanthr&#333;p&#333;s t&#333;i Paul&#333;i<br>
 chr&#275;samenos\)</i></b>. "Using <b><i>(\chr&#275;samenos\, first aorist middle<br>
 participle of \chraomai\, to use)</i></b> Paul <b><i>(instrumental case used<br>
 with this verb)</i></b> kindly" <b><i>(\philanthr&#333;p&#333;s\, "philanthropically,"<br>
 adverb from \phil-anthr&#333;pos\, love of mankind)</i></b>. He was kindly to<br>
 Paul throughout the voyage <b><i>(verse <!-#-->43; 28:16)</i></b>, taking a personal<br>
 interest in his welfare. <B>{Refresh himself}</B> <b><i>(\epimeleias<br>
 tuchein\)</i></b>. Second aorist active infinitive of \tugchan&#333;\ <b><i>(to<br>
 obtain)</i></b> with the genitive \epimeleias\, old word from \epimel&#275;s\,<br>
 careful, only here in the N.T. Whether it was mere hospitality we<br>
 do not know. It may have been medical attention required because<br>
 of Paul's long confinement. This is Paul's first visit to Sidon,<br>
 but Christians were already in Phoenicia <b><i>(<!-#-->11:19)</i></b> and so Paul<br>
 had "friends" here.<br>
 <br>
 27:4 <B>{We sailed under the lee of Cyprus}</B> <b><i>(\hupepleusamen t&#275;n<br>
 Kupron\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of \hupople&#333;\, to sail<br>
 under. Cyprus was thus on the left between the ship and the wind<br>
 from the northwest, under the protection of Cyprus. <B>{Because the<br>
 winds were contrary}</B> <b><i>(\dia to tous anemous einai enantious\)</i></b>. The<br>
 articular infinitive after \dia\ and the accusative of general<br>
 reference <b><i>(\anemous\)</i></b> with predicate accusative <b><i>(\enantious\,<br>
 facing them, in their very teeth if they went that way)</i></b>. The<br>
 Etesian winds were blowing from the northwest so that they could<br>
 not cut straight across from Sidon to Patara with Cyprus on the<br>
 right. They must run behind Cyprus and hug the shore of Cilicia<br>
 and Pamphylia.<br>
 <br>
 27:5 <B>{When we had sailed across}</B> <b><i>(\diapleusantes\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active participle of \diaple&#333;\ <b><i>(another compound of \ple&#333;\)</i></b>. <B>{The<br>
 sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia}</B> <b><i>(\to pelagos to kata t&#275;n<br>
 Kilikian kai Pamphulian\)</i></b>. \Pelagos\ is properly the high sea as<br>
 here. In <!-#-->Mt 18:6 <b><i>(which see)</i></b> Jesus uses it of "the depth of the<br>
 sea." Only these examples in the N.T. The current runs westward<br>
 along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia and the land would<br>
 protect from the wind. <B>{We came to Myra of Lycia}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;lthamen<br>
 eis Murra t&#275;s Lukias\)</i></b>. Literally, "We came down." This town was<br>
 two and a half miles from the coast of Lycia. The port Andriace<br>
 had a fine harbour and did a large grain business. No disciples<br>
 are mentioned here nor at Lasea, Melita, Syracuse, Rhegium.<br>
 <br>
 27:6 <B>{Sailing for Italy}</B> <b><i>(\pleon eis t&#275;n Italian\)</i></b>. This was the<br>
 opportunity for which Lysias had been looking. So he put<br>
 <b><i>(\enebibasen\, first aorist active of \embibaz&#333;\, to cause to<br>
 enter. Cf. \epibantes\ in verse <!-#-->2)</i></b> prisoners and soldiers on<br>
 board. This was a ship of Alexandria bound for Rome, a grain ship<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->38)</i></b> out of its course because of the wind. Such grain ships<br>
 usually carried passengers.<br>
 <br>
 27:7 <B>{When we had sailed slowly}</B> <b><i>(\braduploountes\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 active participle of \braduploe&#333;\ <b><i>(\bradus\, slow, \plous\,<br>
 voyage)</i></b>. Literally, "sailing slowly," not "having or had sailed<br>
 slowly." Only here and in Artemidorus <b><i>(sec. cent. A.D.)</i></b>. It may<br>
 mean "tacking" before the wind. Polybius uses \tachuploe&#333;\, to<br>
 sail swiftly. <B>{Many days}</B> <b><i>(\en hikanais h&#275;merais\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Lu<br>
 7:6 for \hikanos\. Literally, "in considerable days." <B>{With<br>
 difficulty}</B> <b><i>(\molis\)</i></b>. Used in old Greek, like \mogis\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 9:39)</i></b> from \molos\, toil <b><i>(see <!-#-->Ac 14:18)</i></b>. <B>{Over against Cnidus}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kata t&#275;n Knidon\)</i></b>. "Down along Cnidus." A hundred and thirty<br>
 miles from Myra, the southwest point of Asia Minor and the<br>
 western coast. Here the protection of the land from the northwest<br>
 wind ceased. <B>{The wind not further suffering us}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; prose&#333;ntos<br>
 h&#275;m&#257;s tou anemou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute with present active<br>
 participle of \prosea&#333;\, one of the few words still "not found<br>
 elsewhere" <b><i>(Thayer)</i></b>. Regular negative \m&#275;\ with participles. They<br>
 could not go on west as they had been doing since leaving Myra.<br>
 <B>{We sailed under the lee of Crete}</B> <b><i>(\hupepleusamen t&#275;n Kr&#275;t&#275;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 See under verse &#175;4. Instead of going to the right of Crete as<br>
 the straight course would have been they sailed southwest with<br>
 Crete to their right and got some protection against the wind<br>
 there. <B>{Over against Salmone}</B> <b><i>(\kata Salm&#333;n&#275;n\)</i></b>. Off Cape<br>
 Salmone, a promontory on the east of the island.<br>
 <br>
 27:8 <B>{Coasting along}</B> <b><i>(\paralegomenoi\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 participle of \paraleg&#333;\, to lay beside, not from \leg&#333;\, to<br>
 collect or \leg&#333;\, to say. Diodorus Siculus uses \paralegomai\ in<br>
 precisely this sense of coasting along, like Latin _legere oram_.<br>
 In N.T. only here and verse <!-#-->13. <B>{Fair Havens}</B> <b><i>(\Kalous<br>
 Limenas\)</i></b>. This harbour is named Kalus Limeonas, a small bay two<br>
 miles east of Cape Matala. It opens to the East and Southeast,<br>
 but is not fit to winter in. This harbour would protect them for<br>
 a time from the winds. <B>{The city of Lasea}</B> <b><i>(\polis Lasea\)</i></b>.<br>
 Neither Lasea nor Fair Havens is mentioned by any ancient writer,<br>
 two of the hundred cities of Crete.<br>
 <br>
 27:9 <B>{Where much time was spent}</B> <b><i>(\Hikanou chronou<br>
 diagenomenou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again with second aorist middle<br>
 participle of \diaginomai\, to come in between <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b>.<br>
 "Considerable time intervening," since they became weatherbound<br>
 in this harbour, though some take it since they left Caesarea.<br>
 <B>{And the voyage was now dangerous}</B> <b><i>(\kai ontos &#275;d&#275; episphalous\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute, "and the voyage being already <b><i>(\&#275;d&#275;\=Latin<br>
 _jam_)</i></b> dangerous" <b><i>(old word from \epi\ and \sphall&#333;\, to trip, to<br>
 fall, and so prone to fall, here only in N.T.)</i></b>. <B>{Because the Fast<br>
 was now already gone by}</B> <b><i>(\dia to kai t&#275;n n&#275;steian &#275;d&#275;<br>
 parel&#275;luthenai\)</i></b>. Accusative <b><i>(after \dia\)</i></b> of the articular<br>
 infinitive perfect active of \parerchomai\, to pass by, with the<br>
 accusative of general reference <b><i>(\n&#275;steian\, the great day of<br>
 atonement of the Jews, <!-#-->Le 16:29ff.)</i></b> occurring about the end of<br>
 September. The ancients considered navigation on the<br>
 Mediterranean unsafe from early October till the middle of March.<br>
 In A.D. 59 the Fast occurred on Oct. 5. There is nothing strange<br>
 in Luke using this Jewish note of time as in <!-#-->20:6 though a<br>
 Gentile Christian. Paul did it also <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 16:8)</i></b>. It is no proof<br>
 that Luke was a Jewish proselyte. We do not know precisely when<br>
 the party left Caesarea <b><i>(possibly in August)</i></b>, but in ample time<br>
 to arrive in Rome before October if conditions had been more<br>
 favourable. But the contrary winds had made the voyage very slow<br>
 and difficult all the way <b><i>(verse <!-#-->7)</i></b> besides the long delay here<br>
 in this harbour of Fair Havens. <B>{Paul admonished them}</B> <b><i>(\par&#275;in&#275;i<br>
 ho Paulos\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \paraine&#333;\, old word to exhort<br>
 from \para\ and \aine&#333;\, to praise <b><i>(<!-#-->3:8)</i></b>, only here and verse<br>
 <!-#-->22 in N.T. It is remarkable that a prisoner like Paul should<br>
 venture to give advice at all and to keep on doing it <b><i>(imperfect<br>
 tense inchoative, began to admonish and kept on at it)</i></b>. Paul had<br>
 clearly won the respect of the centurion and officers and also<br>
 felt it to be his duty to give this unasked for warning. <B>{I<br>
 perceive}</B> <b><i>(\the&#333;r&#333;\)</i></b>. Old word from \the&#333;ros\, a spectator. See<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 10:18. Paul does not here claim prophecy, but he had plenty<br>
 of experience with three shipwrecks already <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 11:25)</i></b> to<br>
 justify his apprehension. <B>{Will be}</B> <b><i>(\mellein esesthai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Infinitive in indirect assertion followed by future infinitive<br>
 after \mellein\ in spite of \hoti\ which would naturally call for<br>
 present indicative \mellei\, an anacoluthon due to the long<br>
 sentence <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 478)</i></b>. <B>{With injury}</B> <b><i>(\meta<br>
 hubre&#333;s\)</i></b>. An old word from \huper\ <b><i>(above, upper, like our<br>
 "uppishness")</i></b> and so pride, insult, personal injury, the legal<br>
 word for personal assault <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. III. 6, 4)</i></b><br>
 uses it of the injury of the elements. <B>{Loss}</B> <b><i>(\z&#275;mian\)</i></b>. Old<br>
 word, opposite of \kerdos\, gain or profit <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 3:7f.)</i></b>. Nowhere<br>
 else in N.T. <B>{Lading}</B> <b><i>(\phortiou\)</i></b>. Diminutive of \phortos\ <b><i>(from<br>
 \pher&#333;\, to bear)</i></b> only in form. Common word, but in N.T. only<br>
 here in literal sense, as metaphor in <!-#-->Mt 11:30; 23:4; Lu 11:46;<br>
 Ga 6:5. <B>{But also of our lives}</B> <b><i>(\alla kai t&#333;n psuch&#333;n\)</i></b>. Common<br>
 use of \psuch&#275;\ for life, originally "breath of life" <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 20:10)</i></b>, and also "soul" <b><i>(<!-#-->14:2)</i></b>. Fortunately no lives were<br>
 lost, though all else was. But this outcome was due to the<br>
 special mercy of God for the sake of Paul <b><i>(verse <!-#-->24)</i></b>, not to<br>
 the wisdom of the officers in rejecting Paul's advice. Paul<br>
 begins now to occupy the leading role in this marvellous voyage.<br>
 <br>
 27:11 <B>{Gave more heed}</B> <b><i>(\m&#257;llon epeitheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of<br>
 \peith&#333;\, to yield to <b><i>(with the dative case)</i></b>. The "Frumentarian"<br>
 centurion ranked above the captain and owner. As a military<br>
 officer the centurion was responsible for the soldiers, the<br>
 prisoners, and the cargo of wheat. It was a government ship.<br>
 Though the season was not advanced, the centurion probably feared<br>
 to risk criticism in Rome for timidity when the wheat was so much<br>
 needed in Rome <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. <B>{To the master}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i kubern&#275;t&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Old word from \kuberna&#333;\, to steer, and so steersman, pilot,<br>
 sailing-master. Common in this sense in the papyri. In N.T. only<br>
 here and <!-#-->Re 18:17. <B>{And to the owner of the ship}</B> <b><i>(\kai t&#333;i<br>
 naukl&#275;r&#333;i\)</i></b>. Old word compounded of \naus\ and \kl&#275;ros\ and used<br>
 for owner of the ship who acted as his own skipper or captain.<br>
 The papyri examples <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan's _Vocabulary_)</i></b> all<br>
 have the meaning "captain" rather than "owner."<br>
 <br>
 27:12 <B>{Because the haven was not commodious to winter in}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\aneuthetou tou limenos huparchontos pros paracheimasian\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute again present tense of \huparch&#333;\: "The harbour<br>
 being unfit <b><i>(\aneuthetou\, this compound not yet found elsewhere,<br>
 simplex in <!-#-->Lu 9:62; 14:35; Heb 6:7)</i></b> for wintering"<br>
 <b><i>(\paracheimasia\, only here in N.T., but in Polybius and<br>
 Diodorus, in an inscription A.D. 48, from \paracheimaz&#333;\)</i></b>. <B>{The<br>
 more part advised}</B> <b><i>(\hoi pleiones ethento boul&#275;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 middle indicative of \tith&#275;mi\, ancient idiom with \boul&#275;n\, to<br>
 take counsel, give counsel. Lysias held a council of the officers<br>
 of the ship on the issue raised by Paul. <B>{If by any means they<br>
 could reach Phoenix and winter there}</B> <b><i>(\ei p&#333;s dunainto<br>
 katant&#275;santes eis Phoinika paracheimasai\)</i></b>. The optative<br>
 \dunainto\ <b><i>(present middle of \dunamai\)</i></b> here with \ei\ is a<br>
 condition of the fourth class with the notion of purpose implied<br>
 and indirect discourse <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1021)</i></b>. "We vote<br>
 for going on the chance that we may be able" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. Phoenix is<br>
 the town of palms <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 12:13)</i></b>, the modern Lutro, the only town<br>
 in Crete on the southern coast with a harbour fit for wintering,<br>
 though Wordsworth and Page argue for Phineka which suits Luke's<br>
 description better. The verb \paracheimaz&#333;\, to winter, is from<br>
 \para\ and \cheim&#333;n\ <b><i>(see also <!-#-->28:11)</i></b>. Used in several _Koin&#275;_<br>
 writers. <B>{Looking northeast and southeast}</B> <b><i>(\bleponta kata liba<br>
 kai kata ch&#333;ron\)</i></b>. There are two ways of interpreting this<br>
 language. \Lips\ means the southwest wind and \ch&#333;ros\ the<br>
 northwest wind. But what is the effect of \kata\ with these<br>
 words? Does it mean "facing" the wind? If so, we must read<br>
 "looking southwest and northwest." But \kata\ can mean down the<br>
 line of the wind <b><i>(the way the wind is blowing)</i></b>. If so, then it is<br>
 proper to translate "looking northeast and southeast." This<br>
 translation suits Lutro, the other suits Phoenike. Ramsay takes<br>
 it to be Lutro, and suggests that sailors describe the harbour by<br>
 the way it looks as they go into it <b><i>(the subjectivity of the<br>
 sailors)</i></b> and that Luke so speaks and means Lutro which faces<br>
 northeast and southeast. On the whole Lutro has the best of the<br>
 argument.<br>
 <br>
 27:13 <B>{When the south wind blew softly}</B> <b><i>(\hupopneusantos notou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute with aorist active participle of \hupopne&#333;\,<br>
 old verb to blow under, then to blow gently, here only in N.T. "A<br>
 south wind having blown gently," in marked contrast to the<br>
 violent northwest wind that they had faced so long. They were so<br>
 sure of the wisdom of their decision that they did not even draw<br>
 up the small boat attached by a rope to the vessel's stern <b><i>(verse<br>
 <!-#-->16)</i></b>. It was only some forty miles to Lutro. <B>{Their purpose}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\t&#275;s prothese&#333;s\, set before them, from \protith&#275;mi\)</i></b>, genitive<br>
 after \krate&#333;\ <b><i>(\kekrat&#275;kenai\, perfect active infinitive in<br>
 indirect discourse)</i></b>. <B>{They weighed anchor}</B> <b><i>(\&#257;rantes\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active participle of \air&#333;\, old verb used in technical<br>
 sense with \tas agkuras\ <b><i>(anchors)</i></b> understood as in Thucydides I.<br>
 52; II. 23, "having lifted the anchors." Page takes it simply as<br>
 "moving." <B>{Sailed along Crete}</B> <b><i>(\parelegonto t&#275;n Kr&#275;t&#275;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect middle. See verse <!-#-->8, "were coasting along Crete."<br>
 <B>{Close in shore}</B> <b><i>(\&#257;sson\)</i></b>. Comparative adverb of \agki\, near,<br>
 and so "nearer" to shore. Only here in N.T.<br>
 <br>
 27:14 <B>{After no long time}</B> <b><i>(\met' ou polu\)</i></b>. Litotes again. <B>{Beat<br>
 down from it}</B> <b><i>(\ebalen kat' aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative of \ball&#333;\, to throw. Here "dashed" <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b>.<br>
 \Aut&#275;s\ is in the ablative, not genitive case, beat "down from<br>
 it" <b><i>(Crete)</i></b>, not "against it or on it." <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 606)</i></b>. \Aut&#275;s\ cannot refer to \ploion\ <b><i>(boat)</i></b> which is neuter. So<br>
 the ablative case with \kata\ as in <!-#-->Mr 5:13, Homer also. The<br>
 Cretan mountains are over 7,000 feet high. <B>{A tempestuous wind<br>
 which is called Euraquilo}</B> <b><i>(\anemos tuph&#333;nikos ho kaloumenos<br>
 Eurakul&#333;n\)</i></b>. \Tuph&#333;n=Tuph&#333;s\ was used for the typhoon, a violent<br>
 whirlwind <b><i>(\turbo\)</i></b> or squall. This word gives the character of<br>
 the wind. The \Eurakul&#333;n\ <b><i>(reading of Aleph A B against the<br>
 Textus Receptus \Euroklud&#333;n\)</i></b> has not been found elsewhere. Blass<br>
 calls it a hybrid word compounded of the Greek \euros\ <b><i>(east<br>
 wind)</i></b> and the Latin \aquilo\ <b><i>(northeast)</i></b>. It is made like<br>
 \euronotos\ <b><i>(southeast)</i></b>. The Vulgate has _euroaquilo_. It is thus<br>
 the east north east wind. Page considers Euroclydon to be a<br>
 corruption of Euraquilo. Here the name gives the direction of the<br>
 wind.<br>
 <br>
 27:15 <B>{When the ship was caught}</B> <b><i>(\sunarpasthentos tou ploiou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute again with first aorist passive of \sunarpaz&#333;\,<br>
 old word, in N.T. only <!-#-->Lu 8:29; Ac 6:12; 19:29, and here.<br>
 Graphic picture as if the ship was seized by a great monster.<br>
 <B>{Face the wind}</B> <b><i>(\antophthalmein t&#333;i anem&#333;i\)</i></b>. Dative case with<br>
 the vivid infinitive of \antophthalme&#333;\ from \antophthalmos\,<br>
 looking in the eye, or eye to eye <b><i>(\anti\, facing and<br>
 \opthalmos\, eye)</i></b>. Eyes were painted on the prows of vessels. The<br>
 ship could not face the wind enough to get to Phoenix. Modern<br>
 sailors talk of sailing into the eye of the wind. We were not<br>
 able to look the wind in the eye. _Koin&#275;_ verb used by Polybius.<br>
 Some MSS. have it in <!-#-->Ac 6:11, but only here in N.T. In Wisdom<br>
 of Sol. 12:14 it is used of a prince who cannot look God in the<br>
 face. Clement of Rome 34 uses it of an idle workman not able to<br>
 look his employer in the face <b><i>(Milligan and Moulton's<br>
 _Vocabulary_)</i></b>. <B>{We gave way}</B> <b><i>(\epidontes\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 participle of \epidid&#333;mi\, giving way to the wind. <B>{Were driven}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epherometha\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive of \pher&#333;\, "we were being<br>
 borne along." We "scudded before the gale" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. "The<br>
 suddenness of the hurricane gave no time to furl the great<br>
 mainsail" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 27:16 <B>{Running under the lee of}</B> <b><i>(\hupodramontes\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active participle of \hupotrech&#333;\. Same use of \hupo\ as in<br>
 \hupepleusamen\ <b><i>(verses <!-#-->4,8)</i></b> for "under the lee", under the<br>
 protection of. \N&#275;sion\ is diminutive of \n&#275;sos\, a small island.<br>
 The MSS. vary between Cauda <b><i>(B)</i></b> and Clauda <b><i>(Aleph)</i></b>. <B>{To secure<br>
 the boat}</B> <b><i>(\perikrateis genesthai t&#275;s skaph&#275;s\)</i></b>. "To become<br>
 masters <b><i>(\perikrateis\ from \peri\ and \kratos\, power over,<br>
 found in Susannah and ecclesiastical writers, and here only in<br>
 N.T.)</i></b> of the boat <b><i>("dug out," like Indian boats, literally, from<br>
 \skapt&#333;\, to dig, old word, here only in N.T. and verses<br>
 <!-#-->30,32)</i></b>. The smooth water behind the little island enabled them<br>
 to do this. <B>{When they had hoisted it up}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;n &#257;rantes\)</i></b>. "Which<br>
 <b><i>(the little boat)</i></b> having hoisted up <b><i>(\arantes\, verse <!-#-->13)</i></b>."<br>
 Even so it was "with difficulty" <b><i>(\molis\)</i></b>. Perhaps the little<br>
 boat was waterlogged. <B>{Used helps}</B> <b><i>(\bo&#275;theiais echr&#333;nto\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect middle of \chraomai\ with instrumental case. The<br>
 "helps" were ropes or chains, no doubt. <B>{Under-girding the ship}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hupoz&#333;nnuntes to ploion\)</i></b>. Present active participle of<br>
 \hupoz&#333;nnumi\. Old verb, here only in N.T. Probably cables<br>
 <b><i>(\hupoz&#333;mata\)</i></b> or ropes were used under the hull of the ship<br>
 laterally or even longitudinally, tightly secured on deck. This<br>
 "frapping" was more necessary for ancient vessels because of the<br>
 heavy mast. The little island made it possible to do this also.<br>
 <B>{Lest we be cast upon the Syrtis}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; eis t&#275;n Surtin<br>
 ekpes&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Final clause after verb of fearing <b><i>(\phoboumenoi\)</i></b><br>
 with \m&#275;\ and the second aorist active subjunctive of \ekpipt&#333;\,<br>
 old verb to fall out or off, to be cast away. So here and verses<br>
 <!-#-->26,29, a classical use of the verb for a ship driven out of its<br>
 course on to shoals or rocks <b><i>(Page who cites Xenophon, _Anab_.<br>
 VII. 5, 12)</i></b>. The Syrtis was the name for two quicksands between<br>
 Carthage and Cyrenaica, this clearly being the Syrtis Major most<br>
 dangerous because of the sandbanks <b><i>(\surtis\, from \sur&#333;\)</i></b>. The<br>
 wind would drive the ship right into this peril if something were<br>
 not done. <B>{They lowered the gear}</B> <b><i>(\chalasantes to skeuos\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active participle of \chala&#333;\ <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Lu 5:4 for<br>
 lowering the nets)</i></b>. \Skeuos\ means vessel or gear. They slackened<br>
 or reduced sail, especially the mainsail, but leaving enough to<br>
 keep the ship's head as close to the wind as was practicable. <B>{So<br>
 were driven}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s epheronto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive indicative<br>
 again as in verse <!-#-->15 with the addition of \hout&#333;s\ <b><i>(thus)</i></b>. The<br>
 ship was now fixed as near to the wind <b><i>(E N E)</i></b> as possible <b><i>(seven<br>
 points)</i></b>. That would enable the ship to go actually W by N and so<br>
 avoid the quicksands. J. Smith has shown that, a day being lost<br>
 around Cauda, the ship going 36 miles in 24 hours in 13 days<br>
 would make 468 miles. The Island of Malta <b><i>(Melita)</i></b> is precisely<br>
 in that direction <b><i>(W by N)</i></b> from Cauda and is 480 miles. Page sees<br>
 a difficulty about this explanation of the steady drift of the<br>
 ship in the word \diapheromenon\ in verse <!-#-->27, but that was at<br>
 the end of the drifting and the varied winds could have come then<br>
 and not before. The whole narrative as explained carefully in<br>
 Smith's _Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul_ is a masterpiece of<br>
 precise and accurate scholarship. A resume of his results appears<br>
 in my _Luke the Historian in the Light of Research_.<br>
 <br>
 27:18 <B>{As we laboured exceedingly with the storm}</B> <b><i>(\sphodr&#333;s<br>
 cheimazomen&#333;n h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute with present passive<br>
 participle of \cheimaz&#333;\, old verb to afflict with a tempest<br>
 <b><i>(\cheima\, stormy weather)</i></b>, to toss upon the waves, here alone in<br>
 N.T. <B>{They began to throw overboard}</B> <b><i>(\ekbal&#275;n epoiounto\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "They began to make <b><i>(inchoative imperfect middle of<br>
 \poie&#333;\)</i></b> a casting out" <b><i>(\ekbol&#275;n\ from \ekball&#333;\, to cast out,<br>
 old word, only here in N.T.)</i></b>. Cf. Latin _jacturam facere_. This<br>
 to lighten the ship by throwing overboard the cargo. The grain in<br>
 the ship would shift and make it list and so added to the danger.<br>
 <B>{They cast out}</B> <b><i>(\eripsan\)</i></b>. Third person plural aorist active of<br>
 \ript&#333;\, not \eripsamen\ as Textus Receptus. <B>{With their own<br>
 hands}</B> <b><i>(\autocheires\)</i></b>. Old word <b><i>(\autos, cheir\)</i></b> but here alone<br>
 in N.T. Vivid and graphic touch by Luke who, of course, watched<br>
 every movement day by day. <B>{The tackling}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n skeu&#275;n\)</i></b>. The<br>
 furniture of the ship that could be spared. It was becoming<br>
 desperate.<br>
 <br>
 27:20 <B>{When neither sun nor stars shone upon us}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;te h&#275;liou<br>
 m&#275;te astr&#333;n epiphainont&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again. <B>{For many<br>
 days}</B> <b><i>(\epi pleionas h&#275;meras\)</i></b>. For more days than a few. <B>{No<br>
 small tempest}</B> <b><i>(\cheimonos ouk oligou\)</i></b>. Litotes again. <B>{All hope<br>
 that we should be saved was now taken away}</B> <b><i>(\loipon peri&#275;ireito<br>
 elpis p&#257;sa tou s&#333;zesthai h&#275;mas\)</i></b>. "For the rest <b><i>(or future)</i></b> there<br>
 began to be taken from around us <b><i>(\peri&#275;ireito\ inchoative<br>
 imperfect and see use of the verb in <!-#-->2Co 13:16 of the veil)</i></b> all<br>
 hope of the being saved so far as we were concerned." Despair was<br>
 beginning to settle like a fog on all their hopes. Had Paul lost<br>
 hope?<br>
 <br>
 27:21 <B>{When they had been long without food}</B> <b><i>(\poll&#275;s te asitias<br>
 huparchous&#275;s\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute, the old word \asitia\ from<br>
 \asitos\ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->33)</i></b> \a\ privative and \sitos\, food, here alone<br>
 in N.T. Literally, "There being much abstinence from food." They<br>
 had plenty of grain on board, but no appetite to eat<br>
 <b><i>(sea-sickness)</i></b> and no fires to cook it <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. "Little heart<br>
 being left for food" <b><i>(Randall)</i></b>. Galen and other medical writers<br>
 use \asitia\ and \asitos\ for want of appetite. <B>{Stood forth}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\statheis\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->1:15; 2:14; 17:22. Pictorial word <b><i>(Page)</i></b><br>
 that sets forth the vividness and solemnity of the scene<br>
 <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. <B>{Ye should have hearkened unto me}</B> <b><i>(\edei men<br>
 peitharch&#275;santas moi\)</i></b>. Literally, "It was necessary for you<br>
 hearkening unto me not to set sail <b><i>(\m&#275; anagesthai\)</i></b>." It was not<br>
 the "I told you so" of a small nature, "but a reference to the<br>
 wisdom of his former counsel in order to induce acceptance of his<br>
 present advice" <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>. The first aorist active participle is<br>
 in the accusative of general reference with the present<br>
 infinitive \anagesthai\. <B>{And have gotten this injury and loss}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kerd&#275;sai te t&#275;n hubrin taut&#275;n kai t&#275;n z&#275;mian\)</i></b>. This Ionic form<br>
 \kerd&#275;sai\ <b><i>(from \kerda&#333;\)</i></b> rather than \kerd&#275;nai\ or \kerd&#257;nai\<br>
 is common in late Greek <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 349)</i></b>. The<br>
 Revised Version thus carries over the negative \m&#275;\ to this first<br>
 aorist active infinitive \kerd&#275;sai\ from \kerda&#333;\ <b><i>(cf. on &#175;Mt<br>
 16:26)</i></b>. But Page follows Thayer in urging that this is not<br>
 exact, that Paul means that by taking his advice they ought to<br>
 have escaped this injury and loss. "A person is said in Greek 'to<br>
 gain a loss' when, being in danger of incurring it, he by his<br>
 conduct saves himself from doing so." This is probably Paul's<br>
 idea here.<br>
 <br>
 27:22 <B>{And now}</B> <b><i>(\kai ta nun\)</i></b>. Accusative plural neuter article<br>
 of general reference in contrast with \men\ in verse <!-#-->21. Paul<br>
 shows modesty <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b> in the mild contrast. <B>{No loss of life}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\apobol&#275; psuch&#275;s oudemia\)</i></b>. Old word from \apoball&#333;\, to throw<br>
 away, only twice in N.T. <!-#-->Ro 11:15 <b><i>(rejection)</i></b> and here. He had<br>
 foretold such loss of life as likely <b><i>(verse <!-#-->10)</i></b>, but he now<br>
 gives his reason for his changed view.<br>
 <br>
 27:23 <B>{For there stood by me}</B> <b><i>(\parest&#275; gar moi\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b> indicative of \parist&#275;mi\ with the locative<br>
 case <b><i>(beside me)</i></b>. The very form used by Paul of his trial <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti<br>
 4:17)</i></b> when "the Lord stood by me" <b><i>(\ho de kurios moi parest&#275;\)</i></b><br>
 when others deserted him. This angel of the God whom Paul serves<br>
 <b><i>(in distinction from the heathen gods)</i></b> is the reason for Paul's<br>
 present confidence.<br>
 <br>
 27:24 <B>{Thou must stand before Caesar}</B> <b><i>(\Kaisari se dei<br>
 parast&#275;nai\)</i></b>. Note the same \dei\ <b><i>(must)</i></b> as in <!-#-->23:11 when Jesus<br>
 appeared to Paul in Jerusalem and the same verb \parast&#275;nai\<br>
 <b><i>(second aorist active infinitive)</i></b> used in verse <!-#-->23. <B>{Hath<br>
 granted thee}</B> <b><i>(\kecharistai soi\)</i></b>. Perfect middle indicative of<br>
 \charizomai\ and that from \charis\, a gift or grace. The lives<br>
 of those that sailed with Paul God had spared as a gift<br>
 <b><i>(\charis\)</i></b> to Paul.<br>
 <br>
 27:25 <B>{Wherefore be of good cheer}</B> <b><i>(\dio euthumeite\)</i></b>. God had<br>
 spoken. That was enough. This old verb from \euthumos\ in the<br>
 N.T. only here, verse <!-#-->25; Jas 5:13. See the adjective <!-#-->27:36.<br>
 <B>{For I believe God}</B> <b><i>(\pisteu&#333; gar t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>. This is Paul's<br>
 reason for his own good cheer and for his exhortation to<br>
 confidence in spite of circumstances so untoward. Paul had<br>
 doubtless prayed for his own life and for the lives of all. He<br>
 was sure that he was to bear his witness in Rome.<br>
 <br>
 27:26 <B>{We must be cast}</B> <b><i>(\dei h&#275;m&#257;s ekpesein\)</i></b>. It is necessary<br>
 for us to fall out <b><i>(\ekpesein\, second aorist active infinitive<br>
 of \ekpipt&#333;\)</i></b>. It was not revealed to Paul what island it would<br>
 be.<br>
 <br>
 27:27 <B>{As we were driven to and fro}</B> <b><i>(\diapheromen&#333;n h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute with present passive participle of \diapher&#333;\,<br>
 old verb to bear different ways <b><i>(\dia=duo\, two)</i></b>, this way and<br>
 that. Continued to be tossed to and fro in the rough seas. It<br>
 would seem so to those on board. It does not necessarily mean<br>
 that the wind had changed. The fourteenth night is reckoned from<br>
 the time they left Fair Havens. <B>{In the sea of Adria}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i<br>
 Hadri&#257;i\)</i></b>. Not the Adriatic Sea as we now call the sea between<br>
 Italy and the mainland of Illyricum, but all the lower<br>
 Mediterranean between Italy and Greece. Luke's usage is like that<br>
 of Strabo. <B>{Surmised}</B> <b><i>(\hupenooun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active indicative<br>
 of \huponoe&#333;\, inchoative, began to suspect. <B>{That they were<br>
 drawing near to some country}</B> <b><i>(\prosagein tina autois ch&#333;ran\)</i></b>.<br>
 Infinitive with accusative of general reference in indirect<br>
 assertion. \Prosag&#333;\ is here used intransitively and Luke writes<br>
 from the sailor's standpoint that a certain land was drawing near<br>
 to them <b><i>(\autois\, dative)</i></b>. The sailors heard the sound of<br>
 breakers and grew uneasy.<br>
 <br>
 27:28 <B>{They sounded}</B> <b><i>(\bolisantes\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 participle of \boliz&#333;\ rare verb only here and in Eustathius who<br>
 says it was familiar in ancient Greek. Apparently from \bolis\, a<br>
 missile or dart, and so to throw down the lead into the sea, to<br>
 heave the lead, to take soundings. The inscriptions give<br>
 \bolimos\ for "leaden." <B>{Twenty fathoms}</B> <b><i>(\orguias eikosi\)</i></b>. This<br>
 old word, from \oreg&#333;\, to stretch, means the distance from one<br>
 outstretched middle finger tip to the other likewise<br>
 out-stretched. <B>{After a little space}</B> <b><i>(\brachu diast&#275;santes\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "standing apart a little" <b><i>(second aorist active<br>
 participle of \diist&#275;mi\)</i></b>, that is, the ship going a short<br>
 distance further on. A ship today approaching St. Paul's Bay by<br>
 the rocky point of Koura would pass first twenty, then fifteen<br>
 fathoms <b><i>(Furneaux)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 27:29 <B>{Lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;<br>
 pou kata tracheis topous ekpes&#333;men\)</i></b>. The usual construction<br>
 after a verb of fearing <b><i>(\m&#275;\ and the aorist subjunctive<br>
 \ekpes&#333;men\)</i></b>. Literally, "Lest somewhere <b><i>(\pou\)</i></b> we should fall<br>
 out down against <b><i>(\kata\)</i></b> rocky places." The change in the<br>
 soundings made it a very real fear. \Tracheis\ <b><i>(rough)</i></b> is old<br>
 adjective, but in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 3:5 <b><i>(from <!-#-->Isa<br>
 40:4)</i></b>. <B>{Four anchors}</B> <b><i>(\agkuras tessaras\)</i></b>. Old word from<br>
 \agk&#275;\. In N.T. only in this chapter, with \rhipt&#333;\ here, with<br>
 \ektein&#333;\ in verse <!-#-->30, with \periaire&#333;\ in verse <!-#-->40; and <!-#-->Heb<br>
 6:19 <b><i>(figuratively of hope)</i></b>. <B>{From the stern}</B> <b><i>(\ek prumn&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 Old word, but in N.T. only in <!-#-->Mr 4:38; here and <!-#-->41 in<br>
 contrast with \pr&#333;ira\ <b><i>(prow)</i></b>. The usual practice was and is to<br>
 anchor by the bows. "With a view to running the ship ashore<br>
 anchoring from the stern would, it is said, be best" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>.<br>
 Nelson is quoted as saying that he had been reading <!-#-->Ac 27 the<br>
 morning of the Battle of Copenhagen <b><i>(April, 1801)</i></b> where he<br>
 anchored his ships from the stern. <B>{Wished for the day}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;uchonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, kept on praying for "day to come"<br>
 <b><i>(\h&#275;meran genesthai\)</i></b> before the anchors broke under the strain<br>
 of the storm or began to drag. If the ship had been anchored from<br>
 the prow, it would have swung round and snapped the anchors or<br>
 the stern would have faced the beach.<br>
 <br>
 27:30 <B>{The sailors}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n naut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Old word from \naus\ <b><i>(ship)</i></b>,<br>
 in N.T. only here, verse <!-#-->30; Re 18:17. <B>{Were seeking}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\z&#275;tount&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again with present active<br>
 participle of \z&#275;te&#333;\ to seek. <B>{Had lowered}</B> <b><i>(\chalasant&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Aorist active participle of \chalaz&#333;\. <B>{Under colour}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\prophasei\)</i></b>. Possibly the same word as "prophecy" <b><i>(from<br>
 \pro-ph&#275;mi\, to speak forth)</i></b>, but here pretence, pretext,<br>
 although it may come from \prophain&#333;\, to show forth. The use<br>
 here is an old one and appears also in <!-#-->Mr 12:40; Lu 20:47; 1Th<br>
 2:5; Php 1:18. <B>{As though}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s\)</i></b>. The alleged reason, a common<br>
 Greek idiom with \h&#333;s\ and the participle <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_,<br>
 p. 966)</i></b>. Here with \mellont&#333;n\. <B>{From the foreship}</B> <b><i>(\ek<br>
 pr&#333;ir&#275;s\)</i></b>. Old word for prow of the ship. In the N.T. only here<br>
 and verse <!-#-->41. Note here \ekteinein\ <b><i>(lay out, stretch out)</i></b><br>
 rather than \rhipsantes\ <b><i>(casting)</i></b> in verse <!-#-->29, for they<br>
 pretended to need the small boat to stretch out or lay out the<br>
 anchors in front.<br>
 <br>
 27:31 <B>{Except these abide in the ship}</B> <b><i>(\Ean m&#275; houtoi mein&#333;sin<br>
 en t&#333;i ploi&#333;i\)</i></b>. Condition of the third class <b><i>(undetermined, but<br>
 with hope, etc.)</i></b>. Paul has no hesitancy in saying this in spite<br>
 of his strong language in verse <!-#-->24 about God's promise. He has<br>
 no notion of lying supinely down and leaving God to do it all.<br>
 Without the sailors the ship could not be properly beached.<br>
 <br>
 27:32 <B>{The ropes}</B> <b><i>(\ta schoinia\)</i></b>. Diminutive of \schoinos\, old<br>
 word, but in N.T. only here and <!-#-->Joh 2:15. Paul is now saviour<br>
 of the ship and the soldiers quickly cut loose the skiff and "let<br>
 her fall off" <b><i>(\eiasan aut&#275;n ekpesein\)</i></b> rather than be the means<br>
 of the escape of the sailors who were needed. This dastardly<br>
 scheme of the sailors would have brought frightful loss of life.<br>
 <br>
 27:33 <B>{While the day was coming on}</B> <b><i>(\achri hou h&#275;mera &#275;mellen<br>
 ginesthai\)</i></b>. More likely here \achri hou\ <b><i>(for \achri toutou<br>
 h&#333;i\)</i></b> with the imperfect \&#275;mellen\, has its usual meaning, "until<br>
 which time day was about to come on <b><i>(\ginesthai\, present middle<br>
 infinitive, linear action)</i></b>." That is Paul kept on exhorting or<br>
 beseeching <b><i>(\parekalei\, imperfect active)</i></b> them until dawn began<br>
 to come on <b><i>(cf. verse <!-#-->39 when day came)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Heb 3:13 \achri<br>
 hou\ with the present indicative has to mean "so long as" or<br>
 while, but that is not true here <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 975)</i></b>.<br>
 See on &#175;Ac 2:46 for the same phrase for partaking food<br>
 <b><i>(\metalamban&#333; troph&#275;s\, genitive case)</i></b> as also in <!-#-->27:34. Paul<br>
 wanted them to be ready for action when day really came.<br>
 "Fourteenth day" repeated <b><i>(verse <!-#-->27)</i></b>, only here in the<br>
 accusative of duration of time <b><i>(\h&#275;meran\)</i></b>. It is not clear<br>
 whether the "waiting" <b><i>(\prosdok&#333;ntes\, present active participle<br>
 predicate nominative complementary participle after \diateleite\,<br>
 Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1121)</i></b> means fourteen days of continuous<br>
 fasting or only fourteen successive nights of eager watching<br>
 without food. Galen and Dionysius of Halicarnassus employ the<br>
 very idiom used here by Luke <b><i>(\asitos diatele&#333;\)</i></b>. <B>{Having taken<br>
 nothing}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;then proslabomenoi\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle<br>
 participle of \proslamban&#333;\ with the accusative \m&#275;then\ rather<br>
 than the more usual \m&#275;den\. Probably Paul means that they had<br>
 taken no regular meals, only bits of food now and then.<br>
 <br>
 27:34 <B>{For this is for your safety}</B> <b><i>(\touto gar pros t&#275;s<br>
 humeteras s&#333;t&#275;rias huparchei\)</i></b>. Note \s&#333;t&#275;ria\ in sense of<br>
 "safety," literal meaning, not spiritual salvation. This is the<br>
 only instance in the N.T. of the use of \pros\ with the ablative<br>
 meaning "from the side of" your safety, though a classic idiom<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 623)</i></b>, an example of Luke's literary<br>
 style. <B>{Perish}</B> <b><i>(\apoleitai\)</i></b>. Future middle <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b> of<br>
 \apollumi <b><i>(-u&#333;)</i></b>\, to destroy. So the oldest MSS. rather than<br>
 \peseitai\ from \pipt&#333;\, to fall. This proverbial expression<br>
 occurs also in <!-#-->Lu 21:18 which see and in <!-#-->1Sa 14:45; 2Sa 14:11;<br>
 1Ki 1:52.<br>
 <br>
 27:35 <B>{Gave thanks to God}</B> <b><i>(\eucharist&#275;sen t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active indicative of \euchariste&#333;\ from which our word<br>
 "Eucharist" comes. It was saying grace like the head of a Hebrew<br>
 family and the example of Paul would encourage the others to eat.<br>
 Probably Paul, Luke, and Aristarchus had memories of the Lord's<br>
 supper <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 2:42)</i></b> while to others it was only an ordinary meal<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 24:30)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 27:36 <B>{Then were they all of good cheer}</B> <b><i>(\euthumoi de<br>
 genomenoi\)</i></b>. More exactly, "Then all becoming cheerful," because<br>
 of Paul's words and conduct. <B>{Took food}</B> <b><i>(\proselabonto<br>
 troph&#275;s\)</i></b>. Partitive genitive here <b><i>(some food)</i></b>, not accusative as<br>
 verse <!-#-->33. Paul's courage was contagious.<br>
 <br>
 27:37 <B>{Two hundred three-score and sixteen souls}</B> <b><i>(\diakosiai<br>
 hebdom&#275;konta hex\)</i></b>. The Vatican Manuscript <b><i>(B)</i></b> has \h&#333;s\ in place<br>
 of \diakosiai\ <b><i>(two hundred)</i></b> which Westcott and Hort put in the<br>
 margin. But Alford is probably correct in suggesting that the<br>
 scribe of B wrote \h&#333;s\ by repeating the omega in \ploi&#333;i\ with<br>
 \s\ = 200 <b><i>(Greek numeral)</i></b>. If the number 276 seems large, it is<br>
 to be remembered that we do not know the size of the ship.<br>
 Josephus <b><i>(_Life_, 3)</i></b> says that there were 600 on the ship that<br>
 took him to Italy. The grain ships were of considerable size. The<br>
 number included sailors, soldiers, and prisoners. A muster or<br>
 roll call may have been made.<br>
 <br>
 27:38 <B>{When they had eaten enough}</B> <b><i>(\koresthentes troph&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive of \korennumi\, old verb to satisfy, to<br>
 satiate, with the genitive. Literally, "Having been satisfied<br>
 with food." Here only in the N.T. <B>{They lightened}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ekouphizon\)</i></b>. Inchoative imperfect active, began to lighten.<br>
 Old verb from \kouphos\ and originally to be light, but<br>
 transitive to lighten, as here, from Hippocrates on. <B>{Throwing<br>
 out the wheat}</B> <b><i>(\ekballomenoi ton siton\)</i></b>. The cargo of wheat.<br>
 The second \ekbol&#275;\ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->18)</i></b> or casting out and overboard<br>
 which was only partially done at first.<br>
 <br>
 27:39 <B>{They knew not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk epegin&#333;skon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of<br>
 \epigin&#333;sk&#333;\, to recognize. Probably conative, tried to recognize<br>
 and could not <b><i>(Conybeare and Howson)</i></b>. The island was well-known<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->28:1, \epegn&#333;men\)</i></b>, but St. Paul's Bay where the wreck took<br>
 place was some distance from the main harbour <b><i>(Valetta)</i></b> of Melita<br>
 <b><i>(Malta)</i></b>. <B>{They perceived}</B> <b><i>(\katenooun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of<br>
 \katanoe&#333;\, gradually perceived after some effort as in <!-#-->11:16.<br>
 This beach seemed their only hope. <B>{They took counsel}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ebouleuonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle showing the process of<br>
 deliberation and doubt. The bay "having a beach" <b><i>(\echonta<br>
 aigialon\)</i></b> is a phrase found in Xenophon's _Anabasis_ VI. 4, 4.<br>
 <B>{Whether they could drive}</B> <b><i>(\ei dunainto eks&#333;sai\)</i></b>. This use of<br>
 the optative with \ei\ in questions of this sort <b><i>(implied<br>
 indirect)</i></b> is a neat Greek idiom <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1021)</i></b>.<br>
 B C Bohairic read \eks&#333;sai\ <b><i>(first aorist active infinitive of<br>
 \eks&#333;z&#333;\)</i></b>, to save out <b><i>(so Westcott and Hort)</i></b>, instead of<br>
 \ex&#333;sai\ <b><i>(from \ex&#333;the&#333;\, to push out, as Textus Receptus)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 27:40 <B>{Casting off}</B> <b><i>(\perielontes\)</i></b>. Second aorist active of<br>
 \periaire&#333;\. Literally, "Having taken away from around," that is<br>
 all four anchors from around the stern. Cf. the other verbs with<br>
 \agkuras\ in verse <!-#-->29,30. <B>{They left them in the sea}</B> <b><i>(\ei&#333;n<br>
 eis t&#275;n thalassan\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \ea&#333;\, either<br>
 descriptive or inchoative. They let the anchors go and the ropes<br>
 fell down into the sea. <B>{At the same time loosing the bands of<br>
 the rudders}</B> <b><i>(\hama anentes tas zeukt&#275;rias t&#333;n p&#275;dali&#333;n\)</i></b>. On the<br>
 use of \hama\ with the participle, old Greek idiom see Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 1139. The second aorist active participle of<br>
 \ani&#275;mi\, to relax, loosen up. Old verb, in N.T. <!-#-->Ac 16:26;<br>
 27:40; Eph 6:9; Heb 13:5. Thayer notes that \zeukt&#275;rias\ <b><i>(bands)</i></b><br>
 occurs nowhere else, but several papyri use it of yokes and<br>
 waterwheels <b><i>(Moulton and Milligan's _Vocabulary_)</i></b>. The word for<br>
 rudders <b><i>(\p&#275;dalion\)</i></b> is an old one <b><i>(from \p&#275;don\, the blade of an<br>
 oar)</i></b>, but in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Jas 3:4. Page notes that<br>
 the ancient ships had a pair of paddle rudders like those of the<br>
 early northmen, one on each quarter. The paddle rudders had been<br>
 fastened while the ship was anchored. <B>{Hoisting up the foresail<br>
 to the wind}</B> <b><i>(\eparantes ton artem&#333;na t&#275;i pneous&#275;i\)</i></b>. Supply<br>
 \aur&#257;i\ <b><i>(breeze)</i></b> after \pneous&#275;i\ <b><i>(blowing)</i></b>. It is not clear what<br>
 "sail" is meant by "\artem&#333;na\." No other example in Greek is<br>
 known, though the scholiast to Juvenal XII. 68 explains \velo<br>
 prora suo\ by _artemone solo_. Hence "foresail" is probably<br>
 correct. <B>{They made for the beach}</B> <b><i>(\kateichon eis ton<br>
 aigialon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \katech&#333;\, to hold down, perhaps<br>
 inchoative. "They began to hold the ship steadily for the beach."<br>
 <br>
 27:41 <B>{But lighting upon}</B> <b><i>(\peripesontes de\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active participle of \peripipt&#333;\, old verb to fall into and so be<br>
 encompassed by as in <!-#-->Lu 10:30; Jas 1:2. There is a current on<br>
 one side of St. Paul's Bay between a little island <b><i>(Salmonetta)</i></b><br>
 and Malta which makes a sand bank between the two currents.<br>
 Unexpectedly the ship stuck in this sandbar. <B>{Where two seas met}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dithalasson\)</i></b>. Used in Strabo and Dio Chrysostom for divided<br>
 seas <b><i>(\dis, thalassa\)</i></b>. <B>{They ran the vessel aground}</B> <b><i>(\epekeilan<br>
 t&#275;n naun\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of old verb<br>
 \epikell&#333;\, to run a ship ashore. Only here in N.T. Here also we<br>
 have the only N.T. use of \naus\ for ship <b><i>(from \na&#333;, ne&#333;\, to<br>
 swim)</i></b> so common in ancient Greek. Our word navy is from this word<br>
 through the Latin. <B>{Struck}</B> <b><i>(\ereisasa\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 participle of \ereid&#333;\, old verb to fix firmly. Only here in N.T.<br>
 <B>{Unmoveable}</B> <b><i>(\asaleutos\)</i></b>. From \a\ privative and \saleu&#333;\ to<br>
 shake. Old word. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->Heb 12:28. <B>{Began to<br>
 break up}</B> <b><i>(\elueto\)</i></b>. Inchoative imperfect passive of the old<br>
 verb \lu&#333;\, to loosen. The prow was stuck in the sand-bar, and<br>
 the stern was breaking to pieces by the opposing waves lashing on<br>
 both sides. It was a critical moment.<br>
 <br>
 27:42 <B>{Counsel was to kill}</B> <b><i>(\boul&#275; egeneto hina--apoktein&#333;sin\)</i></b>.<br>
 The soldiers did not relish the idea of the escape of the<br>
 prisoners. Hence there came this "counsel" <b><i>(\boul&#275;\)</i></b>. Regular<br>
 Greek idiom for purpose <b><i>(\hina\ and aorist active subjunctive of<br>
 \apoktein&#333;\, to kill)</i></b>. Soldiers were responsible for the lives of<br>
 prisoners <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 12:19)</i></b>. <B>{Swim out}</B> <b><i>(\ekkolumb&#275;sas\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 active participle of \ekkolumba&#333;\, old verb to swim out and so<br>
 away. <B>{Escape}</B> <b><i>(\diaphug&#275;i\)</i></b>. Second aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b> active<br>
 subjunctive of \diapheug&#333;\, to make a clean <b><i>(\dia\)</i></b> escape.<br>
 <br>
 27:43 <B>{To save Paul}</B> <b><i>(\dias&#333;sai ton Paulon\)</i></b>. Effective first<br>
 aorist active infinitive of \dias&#333;z&#333;\. And no wonder for the<br>
 centurion knew now how much they all owed to Paul. <B>{Stayed them<br>
 from their purpose}</B> <b><i>(\ek&#333;leusen autous tou boul&#275;matos\.)</i></b> Ablative<br>
 case of \boul&#275;ma\ after \ek&#333;leusen\ <b><i>(from \k&#333;leu&#333;\, to hinder,<br>
 common verb)</i></b>. <B>{And get first to land}</B> <b><i>(\pr&#333;tous eis t&#275;n g&#275;n<br>
 exienai\)</i></b>. This classic verb \exeimi\ occurs four times in Acts<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->13:42; 17:15; 20:7; 27:32)</i></b> and nowhere else in the N.T. It was<br>
 a wise command.<br>
 <br>
 27:44 <B>{Some on planks}</B> <b><i>(\hous men epi sanisin\)</i></b>. Common Greek<br>
 idiom <b><i>(\hous men--hous de\)</i></b> for "some--some." The only N.T.<br>
 instance of the old Greek word \sanis\ for board or plank. The<br>
 breaking of the ship gave scraps of timber which some used. <B>{They<br>
 all escaped safe}</B> <b><i>(\pantas dias&#333;th&#275;nai\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 infinitive of \dias&#333;z&#333;\ <b><i>(the very word used for the desire of the<br>
 centurion about Paul)</i></b> with accusative of general reference, the<br>
 clause being subject of \egeneto\. So Luke in this marvellous<br>
 narrative, worthy of any historian in any age, shows how Paul's<br>
 promise was fulfilled <b><i>(verse <!-#-->24)</i></b>. Paul the prisoner is the hero<br>
 of the voyage and shipwreck, a wonderful example of God's<br>
 providential care.<br>
