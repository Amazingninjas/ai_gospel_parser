<p>14:1 <B>{Herod the tetrarch}</B> <b><i>(\H&#275;r&#333;id&#275;s tetraarch&#275;s\)</i></b>. Herod Antipas<br>
 ruler of Galilee and Perea, one-fourth of the dominion of Herod<br>
 the Great. <B>{The report concerning Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n akou&#275;n I&#275;sou\)</i></b>.<br>
 See on &#175;4:24. Cognate accusative, heard the hearing <b><i>(rumour)</i></b>,<br>
 objective genitive. It is rather surprising that he had not heard<br>
 of Jesus before.<br>
 <br>
 14:2 <B>{His servants}</B> <b><i>(\tois paisin autou\)</i></b>. Literally "boys," but<br>
 here the courtiers, not the menials of the palace. <B>{Work in him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\energousin\)</i></b>. Cf. our "energize." "The powers of the invisible<br>
 world, vast and vague in the king's imagination" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. John<br>
 wrought no miracles, but one _redivivus_ might be under the<br>
 control of the unseen powers. So Herod argued. A guilty<br>
 conscience quickened his fears. Possibly he could see again the<br>
 head of John on a charger. "The King has the Baptist on the<br>
 brain" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Cf. Josephus <b><i>(_War_, I. xxx. 7)</i></b> for the story<br>
 that the ghosts of Alexander and Aristobulus haunted the palace<br>
 of Herod the Great. There were many conjectures about Jesus as a<br>
 result of this tour of Galilee and Herod Antipas feared this one.<br>
 <br>
 14:3 <B>{For the sake of Herodias}</B> <b><i>(\dia H&#275;r&#333;idiada\)</i></b>. The death of<br>
 John had taken place some time before. The Greek aorists here<br>
 <b><i>(\ed&#275;sen, apetheto\)</i></b> are not used for past perfects. The Greek<br>
 aorist simply narrates the event without drawing distinctions in<br>
 past time. This Herodias was the unlawful wife of Herod Antipas.<br>
 She was herself a descendant of Herod the Great and had married<br>
 Herod Philip of Rome, not Philip the Tetrarch. She had divorced<br>
 him in order to marry Herod Antipas after he had divorced his<br>
 wife, the daughter of Aretas King of Arabia. It was a nasty mess<br>
 equal to any of our modern divorces. Her first husband was still<br>
 alive and marriage with a sister-in-law was forbidden to Jews<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Le 18:16)</i></b>. Because of her Herod Antipas had put John in the<br>
 prison at Machaerus. The bare fact has been mentioned in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 4:12 without the name of the place. See <!-#-->11:2 also for the<br>
 discouragement of John \en t&#333;i desm&#333;t&#275;ri&#333;i\ <b><i>(place of bondage)</i></b>,<br>
 here \en t&#275;i phulak&#275;i\ <b><i>(the guard-house)</i></b>. Josephus <b><i>(_Ant_. xviii.<br>
 5.2)</i></b> tells us that Machaerus is the name of the prison. On a high<br>
 hill an impregnable fortress had been built. Tristram <b><i>(_Land of<br>
 Moab_)</i></b> says that there are now remains of "two dungeons, one of<br>
 them deep and its sides scarcely broken in" with "small holes<br>
 still visible in the masonry where staples of wood and iron had<br>
 once been fixed. One of these must surely have been the<br>
 prison-house of John the Baptist." "On this high ridge Herod the<br>
 Great built an extensive and beautiful palace" <b><i>(Broadus)</i></b>. "The<br>
 windows commanded a wide and grand prospect, including the Dead<br>
 Sea, the course of the Jordan, and Jerusalem" <b><i>(Edersheim, _Life<br>
 and Times of Jesus_)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:4 <B>{For John said unto him}</B> <b><i>(\elegen gar I&#333;an&#275;s aut&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Possibly the Pharisees may have put Herod up to inveigling John<br>
 to Machaerus on one of his visits there to express an opinion<br>
 concerning his marriage to Herodias <b><i>(Broadus)</i></b> and the imperfect<br>
 tense <b><i>(\elegen\)</i></b> probably means that John said it repeatedly. It<br>
 was a blunt and brave thing that John said. It cost him his head,<br>
 but it is better to have a head like John's and lose it than to<br>
 have an ordinary head and keep it. Herod Antipas was a politician<br>
 and curbed his resentment toward John by his fear of the people<br>
 who still held <b><i>(\eichon\, imperfect tense)</i></b> him as a prophet.<br>
 <br>
 14:6 <B>{When Herod's birthday came}</B> <b><i>(\genesiois genomenois tou<br>
 H&#275;r&#333;idou\)</i></b>. Locative of time <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mr 6:21)</i></b> without the genitive<br>
 absolute. The earlier Greeks used the word \genesia\ for funeral<br>
 commemorations <b><i>(birthdays of the dead)</i></b>, \genethlia\ being the<br>
 word for birthday celebrations of living persons. But that<br>
 distinction has disappeared in the papyri. The word \genesia\ in<br>
 the papyri <b><i>(_Fayum Towns_, 114-20, 115-8, 119-30)</i></b> is always a<br>
 birthday feast as here in Matthew and Mark. Philo used both words<br>
 of birthday feasts. Persius, a Roman satirist <b><i>(_Sat_. V.<br>
 180-183)</i></b>, describes a banquet on Herod's Day. <B>{Danced in the<br>
 midst}</B> <b><i>(\&#333;rch&#275;sato en t&#333;i mes&#333;i\)</i></b>. This was Salome, daughter of<br>
 Herodias by her first marriage. The root of the verb means some<br>
 kind of rapid motion. "Leaped in the middle," Wycliff puts it. It<br>
 was a shameful exhibition of lewd dancing prearranged by Herodias<br>
 to compass her purpose for John's death. Salome had stooped to<br>
 the level of an \almeh\, or common dancer.<br>
 <br>
 14:7 <B>{Promised with an oath}</B> <b><i>(\meta horkou h&#333;molog&#275;sen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "confessed with an oath." For this verb in the sense<br>
 of promise, see <!-#-->Ac 7:17. Note middle voice of \ait&#275;s&#275;tai\ <b><i>(ask<br>
 for herself)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Es 5:3; 7:2.<br>
 <br>
 14:8 <B>{Put forward}</B> <b><i>(\probibastheisa\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Ac 19:33 for a<br>
 similar verb <b><i>(\probalont&#333;n\)</i></b>, "pushing forward." Here <b><i>(Acts)</i></b> the<br>
 Textus Receptus uses \probibaz&#333;\. "It should require a good deal<br>
 of 'educating' to bring a young girl to make such a grim request"<br>
 <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. <B>{Here}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;de\)</i></b>. On the spot. Here and now. <B>{In a<br>
 charger}</B> <b><i>(\epi pinaki\)</i></b>. Dish, plate, platter. Why the obsolete<br>
 "charger"?<br>
 <br>
 14:9 <B>{Grieved}</B> <b><i>(\lup&#275;theis\)</i></b>. Not to hurt, for in verse <!-#-->5 we<br>
 read that he wanted <b><i>(\thel&#333;n\)</i></b> to put him to death<br>
 <b><i>(\apokteinai\)</i></b>. Herod, however, shrank from so dastardly a deed<br>
 as this public display of brutality and bloodthirstiness. Men who<br>
 do wrong always have some flimsy excuses for their sins. A man<br>
 here orders a judicial murder of the most revolting type "for the<br>
 sake of his oath" <b><i>(\dia tous horkous\)</i></b>. "More like profane<br>
 swearing than deliberate utterance once for all of a solemn oath"<br>
 <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. He was probably maudlin with wine and befuddled by the<br>
 presence of the guests.<br>
 <br>
 14:10 <B>{Beheaded John}</B> <b><i>(\apekephalisen I&#333;an&#275;n\)</i></b>. That is, he had<br>
 John beheaded, a causative active tense of a late verb<br>
 \apokephaliz&#333;\. Took his head off.<br>
 <br>
 14:11 <B>{She brought it to her mother}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;negken t&#275;i m&#275;tri aut&#275;s\)</i></b>.<br>
 A gruesome picture as Herodias with fiendish delight witnesses<br>
 the triumph of her implacable hatred of John for daring to<br>
 reprove her for her marriage with Herod Antipas. A woman scorned<br>
 is a veritable demon, a literal she-devil when she wills to be.<br>
 Kipling's "female of the species" again. Legends actually picture<br>
 Salome as in love with John, sensual lust, of which there is no<br>
 proof.<br>
 <br>
 14:12 <B>{And they went and told Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\kai elthontes ap&#275;ggeilan<br>
 t&#333;i I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. As was meet after they had given his body decent<br>
 burial. It was a shock to the Master who alone knew how great<br>
 John really was. The fate of John was a prophecy of what was<br>
 before Jesus. According to <!-#-->Mt 14:13 the news of the fate of<br>
 John led to the withdrawal of Jesus to the desert privately, an<br>
 additional motive besides the need for rest after the strain of<br>
 the recent tour.<br>
 <br>
 14:13 <B>{In a boat}</B> <b><i>(\en ploi&#333;i\)</i></b> "on foot" <b><i>(\pez&#275;i\, some MSS.<br>
 \pez&#333;i\)</i></b>. Contrast between the lake and the land route.<br>
 <br>
 14:14 <B>{Their sick}</B> <b><i>(\tous arr&#333;stous aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. "Without strength"<br>
 <b><i>(\rh&#333;nnumi\ and \a\ privative)</i></b>. \Esplagchnisth&#275;\ is a deponent<br>
 passive. The verb gives the oriental idea of the bowels<br>
 <b><i>(\splagchna\)</i></b> as the seat of compassion.<br>
 <br>
 14:15 <B>{When even was come}</B> <b><i>(\opsias genomen&#275;s\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute. Not sunset about 6 P.M. as in <!-#-->8:16 and as in <!-#-->14:23,<br>
 but the first of the two "evenings" beginning at 3 P.M. <B>{The<br>
 place is desert}</B> <b><i>(\er&#275;mos estin ho topos\)</i></b>. Not a desolate<br>
 region, simply lonely, comparatively uninhabited with no large<br>
 towns near. There were "villages" <b><i>(\k&#333;mas\)</i></b> where the people<br>
 could buy food, but they would need time to go to them. Probably<br>
 this is the idea of the disciples when they add: <B>{The time is<br>
 already past}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; h&#333;ra &#275;d&#275; par&#275;lthen\)</i></b>. They must hurry.<br>
 <br>
 14:16 <B>{Give ye them to eat}</B> <b><i>(\dote autois h&#8211;meis phagein\)</i></b>. The<br>
 emphasis is on \h&#8211;meis\ in contrast <b><i>(note position)</i></b> with their<br>
 "send away" <b><i>(\apoluson\)</i></b>. It is the urgent aorist of instant<br>
 action <b><i>(\dote\)</i></b>. It was an astounding command. The disciples were<br>
 to learn that "no situation appears to Him desperate, no crisis<br>
 unmanageable" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:17 <B>{And they say unto him}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de legousin aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. The<br>
 disciples, like us today, are quick with reasons for their<br>
 inability to perform the task imposed by Jesus.<br>
 <br>
 14:18 <B>{And he said}</B> <b><i>(\ho de eipen\)</i></b>. Here is the contrast between<br>
 the helpless doubt of the disciples and the confident courage of<br>
 Jesus. He used "_the_ five loaves and two fishes" which they had<br>
 mentioned as a reason for doing nothing. "Bring them hither unto<br>
 me." They had overlooked the power of Jesus in this emergency.<br>
 <br>
 14:19 <B>{To sit down on the grass}</B> <b><i>(\anaklith&#275;nai epi tou<br>
 chortou\)</i></b>. "Recline," of course, the word means, first aorist<br>
 passive infinitive. A beautiful picture in the afternoon sun on<br>
 the grass on the mountain side that sloped westward. The orderly<br>
 arrangement <b><i>(Mark)</i></b> made it easy to count them and to feed them.<br>
 Jesus stood where all could see him "break" <b><i>(\klasas\)</i></b> the thin<br>
 Jewish cakes of bread and give to the disciples and they to the<br>
 multitudes. This is a nature miracle that some men find it hard<br>
 to believe, but it is recorded by all four Gospels and the only<br>
 one told by all four. It was impossible for the crowds to<br>
 misunderstand and to be deceived. If Jesus is in reality Lord of<br>
 the universe as John tells us <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:1-18)</i></b> and Paul holds <b><i>(<!-#-->Col<br>
 1:15-20)</i></b>, why should we balk at this miracle? He who created the<br>
 universe surely has power to go on creating what he wills to do.<br>
 <br>
 14:20 <B>{Were filled}</B> <b><i>(\echortasth&#275;san\)</i></b>. Effective aorist passive<br>
 indicative of \chortaz&#333;\. See <!-#-->Mt 5:6. From the substantive<br>
 \chortos\ grass. Cattle were filled with grass and people usually<br>
 with other food. They all were satisfied. <B>{Broken pieces}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n<br>
 klasmat&#333;n\)</i></b>. Not the scraps upon the ground, but the pieces<br>
 broken by Jesus and still in the "twelve baskets" <b><i>(\d&#333;deka<br>
 kophinous\)</i></b> and not eaten. Each of the twelve had a basketful<br>
 left over <b><i>(\to perisseuon\)</i></b>. One hopes that the boy <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 6:9)</i></b><br>
 who had the five loaves and two fishes to start with got one of<br>
 the basketsful, if not all of them. Each of the Gospels uses the<br>
 same word here for baskets <b><i>(\kophinos\)</i></b>, a wicker-basket, called<br>
 "coffins" by Wycliff. Juvenal <b><i>(_Sat_. iii. 14)</i></b> says that the<br>
 grove of Numa near the Capenian gate of Rome was "let out to Jews<br>
 whose furniture is a basket <b><i>(_cophinus_)</i></b> and some hay" <b><i>(for a<br>
 bed)</i></b>. In the feeding of the Four Thousand <b><i>(Matthew and Mark)</i></b> the<br>
 word \sphuris\ is used which was a sort of hamper or large<br>
 provisions basket.<br>
 <br>
 14:21 <B>{Beside women and children}</B> <b><i>(\ch&#333;ris gunaik&#333;n kai<br>
 paidi&#333;n\)</i></b>. Perhaps on this occasion there were not so many as<br>
 usual because of the rush of the crowd around the head of the<br>
 lake. Matthew adds this item and does not mean that the women and<br>
 children were not fed, but simply that "the eaters" <b><i>(\hoi<br>
 esthiontes\)</i></b> included five thousand men <b><i>(\andres\)</i></b> besides the<br>
 women and children.<br>
 <br>
 14:22 <B>{Constrained}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;nagkasen\)</i></b>. Literally, "compelled" or<br>
 "forced." See this word also in <!-#-->Lu 14:23. The explanation for<br>
 this strong word in <!-#-->Mr 6:45 and <!-#-->Mt 14:22 is given in <!-#-->Joh<br>
 6:15. It is the excited purpose of the crowd to take Jesus by<br>
 force and to make him national king. This would be political<br>
 revolution and would defeat all the plans of Jesus about his<br>
 kingdom. Things have reached a climax. The disciples were<br>
 evidently swept off their feet by the mob psychology for they<br>
 still shared the Pharisaic hope of a political kingdom. With the<br>
 disciples out of the way Jesus could handle the crowd more<br>
 easily, <B>{till he should send the multitudes away}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s hou<br>
 apolus&#275;i tous ochlous\)</i></b>. The use of the aorist subjunctive with<br>
 \he&#333;s\ or \he&#333;s hou\ is a neat and common Greek idiom where the<br>
 purpose is not yet realized. So in <!-#-->18:30; 26:36. "While"<br>
 sometimes renders it well. The subjunctive is retained after a<br>
 past tense instead of the change to the optative of the ancient<br>
 Attic. The optative is very rare anyhow, but Luke uses it with<br>
 \prin &#275;\ in <!-#-->Ac 25:16.<br>
 <br>
 14:23 <B>{Into the mountain}</B> <b><i>(\eis to oros\)</i></b>. After the dismissal of<br>
 the crowd Jesus went up alone into the mountain on the eastern<br>
 side of the lake to pray as he often did go to the mountains to<br>
 pray. If ever he needed the Father's sympathy, it was now. The<br>
 masses were wild with enthusiasm and the disciples wholly<br>
 misunderstood him. The Father alone could offer help now.<br>
 <br>
 14:24 <B>{Distressed}</B> <b><i>(\basanizomenon\)</i></b>. Like a man with demons<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->8:29)</i></b>. One can see, as Jesus did <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 6:48)</i></b>, the boat bobbing<br>
 up and down in the choppy sea.<br>
 <br>
 14:25 <B>{Walking upon the sea}</B> <b><i>(\peripat&#333;n epi t&#275;n thalassan\)</i></b>.<br>
 Another nature miracle. Some scholars actually explain it all<br>
 away by urging that Jesus was only walking along the beach and<br>
 not on the water, an impossible theory unless Matthew's account<br>
 is legendary. Matthew uses the accusative <b><i>(extension)</i></b> with \epi\<br>
 in verse <!-#-->25 and the genitive <b><i>(specifying case)</i></b> in <!-#-->26.<br>
 <br>
 14:26 <B>{They were troubled}</B> <b><i>(\etarachth&#275;san\)</i></b>. Much stronger than<br>
 that. They were literally "terrified" as they saw Jesus walking<br>
 on the sea. <B>{An apparition}</B> <b><i>(\phantasma\)</i></b>, or "ghost," or<br>
 "spectre" from \phantaz&#333;\ and that from \phain&#333;\. They cried out<br>
 "from fear" <b><i>(\apo tou phobou\)</i></b> as any one would have done. "A<br>
 little touch of sailor superstition" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:28 <B>{Upon the waters}</B> <b><i>(\epi ta hudata\)</i></b>. The impulsiveness of<br>
 Peter appears as usual. Matthew alone gives this Peter episode.<br>
 <br>
 14:30 <B>{Seeing the wind}</B> <b><i>(\blep&#333;n ton anemon\)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Ex 20:18 and<br>
 <!-#-->Re 1:12 "to see the voice" <b><i>(\t&#275;n ph&#333;n&#275;n\)</i></b>. "It is one thing to<br>
 see a storm from the deck of a stout ship, another to see it in<br>
 the midst of the waves" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Peter was actually beginning to<br>
 sink <b><i>(\katapontizesthai\)</i></b> to plunge down into the sea, "although<br>
 a fisherman and a good swimmer" <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>. It was a dramatic<br>
 moment that wrung from Peter the cry: "Lord, save me" <b><i>(\Kurie,<br>
 s&#333;son me\)</i></b>, and do it quickly the aorist means. He could walk on<br>
 the water till he saw the wind whirl the water round him.<br>
 <br>
 14:31 <B>{Didst thou doubt?}</B> <b><i>(\edistasas?\)</i></b>. Only here and <!-#-->28:17<br>
 in the N.T. From \distaz&#333;\ and that from \dis\ <b><i>(twice)</i></b>. Pulled<br>
 two ways. Peter's trust in the power of Christ gave way to his<br>
 dread of the wind and waves. Jesus had to take hold of Peter<br>
 <b><i>(\epelabeto\, middle voice)</i></b> and pull him up while still walking<br>
 on the water.<br>
 <br>
 14:32 <B>{Ceased}</B> <b><i>(\ekopasen\)</i></b>. From \kopos\, toil. The wind grew<br>
 weary or tired, exhausted itself in the presence of its Master<br>
 <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mr 4:39)</i></b>. Not a mere coincidence that the wind ceased now.<br>
 <br>
 14:33 <B>{Worshipped him}</B> <b><i>(\prosekun&#275;san aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. And Jesus accepted<br>
 it. They were growing in appreciation of the person and power of<br>
 Christ from the attitude in <!-#-->8:27. They will soon be ready for<br>
 the confession of <!-#-->16:16. Already they can say: "Truly God's Son<br>
 thou art." The absence of the article here allows it to mean a<br>
 Son of God as in <!-#-->27:54 <b><i>(the centurion)</i></b>. But they probably mean<br>
 "the Son of God" as Jesus was claiming to them to be.<br>
 <br>
 14:34 <B>{Gennesaret}</B> <b><i>(\Genn&#275;saret\)</i></b>. A rich plain four miles long<br>
 and two broad. The first visit of Jesus apparently with the usual<br>
 excitement at the cures. People were eager to touch the hem of<br>
 Christ's mantle like the woman in <!-#-->9:20. Jesus honoured their<br>
 superstitious faith and "as many as touched were made whole"<br>
 <b><i>(\hosoi h&#275;psanto dies&#333;thesan\)</i></b>, completely <b><i>(\di-\)</i></b> healed.<br>
