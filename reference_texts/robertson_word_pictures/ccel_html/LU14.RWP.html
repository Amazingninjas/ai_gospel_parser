 <HR>
<p>14:1 <B>{When he went}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i elthein auton\)</i></b>. Luke's favourite<br>
 temporal clause = "on the going as to him." <B>{That}</B> <b><i>(\kai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Another common Lukan idiom, \kai=hoti\ after \egeneto\, like<br>
 Hebrew _wav_. <B>{They}</B> <b><i>(\autoi\)</i></b>. Emphatic. <B>{Were watching}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san<br>
 parat&#275;roumenoi\)</i></b>. Periphrastic imperfect middle. Note force of<br>
 \autoi\, middle voice, and \para-\. They were themselves watching<br>
 on the side <b><i>(on the sly)</i></b>, watching insidiously, with evil intent<br>
 as in <!-#-->Mr 3:2 <b><i>(active)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:2 <B>{Which had the dropsy}</B> <b><i>(\hudr&#333;pikos\)</i></b>. Late and medical word<br>
 from \hud&#333;r\ <b><i>(water)</i></b>, one who has internal water <b><i>(\hudr&#333;ps\)</i></b>.<br>
 Here only in the N.T. and only example of the disease healed by<br>
 Jesus and recorded.<br>
 <br>
 14:3 <B>{Answering}</B> <b><i>(\apokritheis\)</i></b>. First aorist passive participle<br>
 without the passive meaning. Jesus answered the thoughts of those<br>
 mentioned in verse <!-#-->1. Here "lawyers and Pharisees" are treated<br>
 as one class with one article <b><i>(\tous\)</i></b> whereas in <!-#-->7:30 they are<br>
 treated as two classes with separate articles. <B>{Or not}</B> <b><i>(\&#275; ou\)</i></b>.<br>
 The dilemma forestalled any question by them. <B>{They held their<br>
 peace}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275;suchasan\)</i></b>. Ingressive aorist active of old verb<br>
 \h&#275;suchaz&#333;\. They became silent, more so than before.<br>
 <br>
 14:4 <B>{Took him}</B> <b><i>(\epilabomenos\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle participle<br>
 of \epilamban&#333;\, an old verb, only in the middle in the N.T. It<br>
 is not redundant use, "took and healed," but "took hold of him<br>
 and healed him." Only instance in the N.T. of its use in a case<br>
 of healing. <B>{Let him go}</B> <b><i>(\apelusen\)</i></b>. Probably, dismissed from<br>
 the company to get him away from these critics.<br>
 <br>
 14:5 <B>{An ass or an ox}</B> <b><i>(\onos &#275; bous\)</i></b>. But Westcott and Hort<br>
 \huios &#275; bous\ <b><i>(<B>{a son or an ox}</B>)</i></b>. The manuscripts are much<br>
 divided between \huios\ <b><i>(son)</i></b> and \onos\ <b><i>(ass)</i></b> which in the<br>
 abbreviated uncials looked much alike <b><i>(TC, OC)</i></b> and were much<br>
 alike. The sentence in the Greek reads literally thus: Whose ox<br>
 or ass of you shall fall <b><i>(\peseitai\, future middle of \pipto\)</i></b><br>
 into a well and he <b><i>(the man)</i></b> will not straightway draw him up<br>
 <b><i>(\anaspasei\, future active of \anaspa&#333;\)</i></b> on the sabbath day? The<br>
 very form of the question is a powerful argument and puts the<br>
 lawyers and the Pharisees hopelessly on the defensive.<br>
 <br>
 14:6 <B>{Could not answer again}</B> <b><i>(\ouk ischusan antapokrith&#275;nai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Did not have strength to answer back or in turn <b><i>(\anti-\)</i></b> as in<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 9:20. They could not take up the argument and were helpless.<br>
 They hated to admit that they cared more for an ox or ass or even<br>
 a son than for this poor dropsical man.<br>
 <br>
 14:7 <B>{A parable for those which were bidden}</B> <b><i>(\pros tous<br>
 kekl&#275;menous parabol&#275;n\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of \kale&#333;\,<br>
 to call, to invite. This parable is for the guests who were there<br>
 and who had been watching Jesus. <B>{When he marked}</B> <b><i>(\epech&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present active participle of \epech&#333;\ with \ton noun\ understood,<br>
 holding the mind upon them, old verb and common. <B>{They chose out}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\exelegonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, were picking out for<br>
 themselves. <B>{The chief seats}</B> <b><i>(\tas pr&#333;toklisias\)</i></b>. The first<br>
 reclining places at the table. Jesus condemned the Pharisees<br>
 later for this very thing <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 23:6; Mr 12:39; Lu 20:46)</i></b>. On a<br>
 couch holding three the middle place was the chief one. At<br>
 banquets today the name of the guests are usually placed at the<br>
 plates. The place next to the host on the right was then, as now,<br>
 the post of honour.<br>
 <br>
 14:8 <B>{Sit not down}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; kataklith&#275;is\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> passive subjunctive of \kataklin&#333;\, to recline. Old<br>
 verb, but peculiar to Luke in the N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->7:36; 9:14; 14:8;<br>
 24:30)</i></b>. <B>{Be bidden}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;i kekl&#275;menos\)</i></b>. Periphrastic perfect<br>
 passive subjunctive of \kale&#333;\ after \m&#275; pote\.<br>
 <br>
 14:9 <B>{And say}</B> <b><i>(\kai erei\)</i></b>. Changes to future indicative with<br>
 \m&#275; pote\ as in <!-#-->12:58. <B>{Shalt begin with shame}</B> <b><i>(\arx&#275;i meta<br>
 aischun&#275;s\)</i></b>. The moment of embarrassment. <B>{To take the lowest<br>
 place}</B> <b><i>(\ton eschaton topon katechein\)</i></b>. To hold down the lowest<br>
 place, all the intermediate ones being taken.<br>
 <br>
 14:10 <B>{Sit down}</B> <b><i>(\anapese\)</i></b>. Second aorist active imperative of<br>
 \anapipt&#333;\, to fall up or back, to lie back or down. Late Greek<br>
 word for \anaklin&#333;\ <b><i>(cf. \kataklin&#333;\ in verse <!-#-->8)</i></b>. <B>{He that hath<br>
 bidden thee}</B> <b><i>(\ho kekl&#275;k&#333;s se\)</i></b>. Perfect active participle as in<br>
 verse <!-#-->12 <b><i>(\t&#333;i kekl&#275;koti\)</i></b> with which compare \ho kalesas\ in<br>
 verse <!-#-->9 <b><i>(first aorist active participle)</i></b>. <B>{He may say}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\erei\)</i></b>. The future indicative with \hina\ does occur in the<br>
 _Koin&#275;_ <b><i>(papyri)</i></b> and so in the N.T. <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 984)</i></b>. <B>{Go up higher}</B> <b><i>(\prosanab&#275;thi\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 imperative second singular of \prosanabain&#333;\, an old double<br>
 compound verb, but here only in the N.T. Probably, "Come up<br>
 higher," because the call comes from the host and because of<br>
 \pros\.<br>
 <br>
 14:11 <B>{Shall be humbled}</B> <b><i>(\tapein&#333;th&#275;setai\)</i></b>. First future<br>
 passive. One of the repeated sayings of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->18:14; Mt<br>
 23:12)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:12 <B>{A dinner or a supper}</B> <b><i>(\ariston &#275; deipnon\)</i></b>. More exactly,<br>
 a breakfast or a dinner with distinction between them as already<br>
 shown. This is a parable for the host as one had just been given<br>
 for the guests, though Luke does not term this a parable. <B>{Call<br>
 not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; ph&#333;nei\)</i></b>. \M&#275;\ and the present imperative active,<br>
 prohibiting the habit of inviting only friends. It is the<br>
 _exclusive_ invitation of such guests that Jesus condemns. There<br>
 is a striking parallel to this in Plato's _Phaedrus_ 233.<br>
 <B>{Recompense}</B> <b><i>(\antapodoma\)</i></b>. In the form of a return invitation.<br>
 Like \anti\ in "bid thee again" <b><i>(\antikales&#333;sin\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:13 <B>{When thou makest a feast}</B> <b><i>(\hotan doch&#275;n poi&#275;is\)</i></b>. \Hotan\<br>
 and the present subjunctive in an indefinite temporal clause.<br>
 \Doch&#275;\ means reception as in <!-#-->Lu 5:29, late word, only in these<br>
 two passages in the N.T. Note absence of article with these<br>
 adjectives in the Greek <b><i>(poor people, maimed folks, lame people,<br>
 blind people)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:14 <B>{To recompense thee}</B> <b><i>(\antapodounai soi\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 active infinitive of this old and common double compound verb, to<br>
 give back in return. The reward will come at the resurrection if<br>
 not before and thou shalt be happy.<br>
 <br>
 14:15 <B>{Blessed}</B> <b><i>(\makarios\)</i></b>. Happy, same word in the Beatitudes<br>
 of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:3ff.)</i></b>. This pious platitude whether due to<br>
 ignorance or hypocrisy was called forth by Christ's words about<br>
 the resurrection. It was a common figure among the rabbis, the<br>
 use of a banquet for the bliss of heaven. This man may mean that<br>
 this is a prerogative of the Pharisees. He assumed complacently<br>
 that he will be among the number of the blest. Jesus himself uses<br>
 this same figure of the spiritual banquet for heavenly bliss <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 22:29)</i></b>. <B>{Shall eat}</B> <b><i>(\phagetai\)</i></b>. Future middle from \esthi&#333;\,<br>
 defective verb, from stem of the aorist <b><i>(\ephagon\)</i></b> like \edomai\<br>
 of the old Greek.<br>
 <br>
 14:16 <B>{Made}</B> <b><i>(\epoiei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, was on the point of<br>
 making <b><i>(inchoative)</i></b>. <B>{Great supper}</B> <b><i>(\deipnon\)</i></b>. Or dinner, a<br>
 formal feast. Jesus takes up the conventional remark of the guest<br>
 and by this parable shows that such an attitude was no guarantee<br>
 of godliness <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. This parable of the marriage of the King's<br>
 son <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 14:15-24)</i></b> has many points of likeness to the parable of<br>
 the wedding garment <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 22:1-14)</i></b> and as many differences also.<br>
 The occasions are very different, that in Matthew grows out of<br>
 the attempt to arrest Jesus while this one is due to the pious<br>
 comment of a guest at the feast and the wording is also quite<br>
 different. Hence we conclude that they are distinct parables.<br>
 <B>{And he bade many}</B> <b><i>(\kai ekalesen pollous\)</i></b>. Aorist active, a<br>
 distinct and definite act following the imperfect \epoiei\.<br>
 <br>
 14:17 <B>{His servant}</B> <b><i>(\ton doulon autou\)</i></b>. His bondservant.<br>
 _Vocator_ or Summoner <b><i>(<!-#-->Es 5:8; 6:14)</i></b>. This second summons was<br>
 the custom then as now with wealthy Arabs. Tristram <b><i>(_Eastern<br>
 Customs_, p. 82)</i></b> says: "To refuse the second summons would be an<br>
 insult, which is equivalent among the Arab tribes to a<br>
 declaration of war."<br>
 <br>
 14:18 <B>{With one consent}</B> <b><i>(\apo mias\)</i></b>. Some feminine substantive<br>
 like \gn&#333;m&#275;s\ or \psuch&#275;s\ has to be supplied. This precise idiom<br>
 occurs nowhere else. It looked like a conspiracy for each one in<br>
 his turn did the same thing. <B>{To make excuse}</B> <b><i>(\paraiteisthai\)</i></b>.<br>
 This common Greek verb is used in various ways, to ask something<br>
 from one <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 15:6)</i></b>, to deprecate or ask to avert <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 12:19)</i></b>,<br>
 to refuse or decline <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 25:11)</i></b>, to shun or to avoid <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti<br>
 2:23)</i></b>, to beg pardon or to make excuses for not doing or to beg<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 14:18ff.)</i></b>. All these ideas are variations of \aite&#333;\, to<br>
 ask in the middle voice with \para\ in composition. <B>{The first}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ho pr&#333;tos\)</i></b>. In order of time. There are three of the "many"<br>
 <b><i>("all")</i></b>, whose excuses are given, each more flimsy than the<br>
 other. <B>{I must needs}</B> <b><i>(\ech&#333; anagk&#275;n\)</i></b>. I have necessity. The<br>
 land would still be there, a strange "necessity." <B>{Have me<br>
 excused}</B> <b><i>(\eche me par&#275;it&#275;menon\)</i></b>. An unusual idiom somewhat like<br>
 the English perfect with the auxiliary "have" and the modern<br>
 Greek idiom with \ech&#333;\, but certainly not here a Greek<br>
 periphrasis for \par&#275;it&#275;so\. This perfect passive participle is<br>
 predicate and agrees with \me\. See a like idiom in <!-#-->Mr 3:1; Lu<br>
 12:19 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 902f.)</i></b>. The Latin had a similar<br>
 idiom, _habe me excusatum_. Same language in verse <!-#-->19.<br>
 <br>
 14:19 <B>{To prove them}</B> <b><i>(\dokimasai auta\)</i></b>. He could have tested<br>
 them before buying. The oxen would not run away or be stolen.<br>
 <br>
 14:20 <B>{I cannot come}</B> <b><i>(\ou dunamai elthein\)</i></b>. Less polite than<br>
 the others but a more plausible pretence if he wanted to make it<br>
 so. The law excused a newly married man from war <b><i>(<!-#-->De 24:5)</i></b>,<br>
 "but not from social courtesy" <b><i>(Ragg)</i></b>. The new wife would<br>
 probably have been glad to go with him to the feast if asked. But<br>
 see <!-#-->1Co 7:33. There is here as often a sharp difference between<br>
 the excuses offered and the reasons behind them.<br>
 <br>
 14:21 <B>{Being angry}</B> <b><i>(\orgistheis\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b><br>
 passive, becoming angry. <B>{Quickly}</B> <b><i>(\tache&#333;s\)</i></b>. The dinner is<br>
 ready and no time is to be lost. The invitation goes still to<br>
 those in the city. <B>{Streets and lanes}</B> <b><i>(\tas plateias kai<br>
 rhumas\)</i></b>. Broadways and runways <b><i>(broad streets and narrow lanes)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Maimed}</B> <b><i>(\anapeirous\)</i></b>. So Westcott and Hort for the old word<br>
 \anap&#275;rous\, due to itacism <b><i>(\ei=&#275;\ in pronunciation)</i></b>. The word<br>
 is compounded of \ana\ and \p&#275;ros\, lame all the way up.<br>
 <br>
 14:22 <B>{And yet there is room}</B> <b><i>(\kai eti topos estin\)</i></b>. The Master<br>
 had invited "many" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->16)</i></b> who had all declined. The servant<br>
 knew the Master wished the places to be filled.<br>
 <br>
 14:23 <B>{The highways and hedges}</B> <b><i>(\tas hodous kai phragmous\)</i></b>. The<br>
 public roads outside the city of Judaism just as the streets and<br>
 lanes were inside the city. The heathen are to be invited this<br>
 time. <B>{Hedges}</B> is fenced in places from \phrass&#333;\, to fence in<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 3:19)</i></b>. <B>{Compel}</B> <b><i>(\anagkason\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 imperative of \anagkaz&#333;\, from \anagk&#275;\ <b><i>(verse <!-#-->18)</i></b>. By<br>
 persuasion of course. There is no thought of compulsory<br>
 salvation. "Not to use force, but to constrain them against the<br>
 reluctance which such poor creatures would feel at accepting the<br>
 invitation of a great lord" <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>. As examples of such<br>
 "constraint" in this verb see <!-#-->Mt 14:22; Ac 26:11; Ga 6:12.<br>
 <B>{That my house may be filled}</B> <b><i>(\hina gemisth&#275;i mou ho oikos\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist passive subjunctive of \gemiz&#333;\, to fill full, old<br>
 verb from \gem&#333;\, to be full. Effective aorist. Subjunctive with<br>
 \hina\ in final clause. The Gentiles are to take the place that<br>
 the Jews might have had <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 11:25)</i></b>. Bengel says: _Nec natura<br>
 nec gratia patitur vacuum_.<br>
 <br>
 14:24 <B>{My supper}</B> <b><i>(\mou tou deipnou\)</i></b>. Here it is still the<br>
 Master of the feast who is summing up his reasons for his<br>
 conduct. We do not have to say that Jesus shuts the door now in<br>
 the face of the Jews who may turn to him.<br>
 <br>
 14:25 <B>{And he turned}</B> <b><i>(\kai strapheis\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive<br>
 participle of \streph&#333;\, common verb. It is a dramatic act on the<br>
 part of Jesus, a deliberate effort to check the wild and<br>
 unthinking enthusiasm of the crowds who followed just to be<br>
 following. Note "many multitudes" <b><i>(\ochloi polloi\)</i></b> and the<br>
 imperfect tense \suneporeuonto\, were going along with him.<br>
 <br>
 14:26 <B>{Hateth not}</B> <b><i>(\ou misei\)</i></b>. An old and very strong verb<br>
 \mise&#333;\, to hate, detest. The orientals use strong language where<br>
 cooler spirits would speak of preference or indifference. But<br>
 even so Jesus does not here mean that one must hate his father or<br>
 mother of necessity or as such, for <!-#-->Mt 15:4 proves the<br>
 opposite. It is only where the element of choice comes in <b><i>(cf.<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 6:24)</i></b> as it sometimes does, when father or mother opposes<br>
 Christ. Then one must not hesitate. The language here is more<br>
 sharply put than in <!-#-->Mt 10:37. The \ou\ here coalesces with the<br>
 verb \misei\ in this conditional clause of the first class<br>
 determined as fulfilled. It is the language of exaggerated<br>
 contrast, it is true, but it must not be watered down till the<br>
 point is gone. In mentioning "and wife" Jesus has really made a<br>
 comment on the excuse given in verse <!-#-->20 <b><i>(I married a wife and<br>
 so I am not able to come)</i></b>. <B>{And his own life also}</B> <b><i>(\eti te kai<br>
 t&#275;n psuch&#275;n heautou\)</i></b>. Note \te kai\, both--and. "The \te\ <b><i>(B L)</i></b><br>
 binds all the particulars into one bundle of _renuncianda_"<br>
 <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>. Note this same triple group of conjunctions <b><i>(\eti te<br>
 kai\)</i></b> in <!-#-->Ac 21:28, "And moreover also," "even going as far as<br>
 his own life." Martyrdom should be an ever-present possibility to<br>
 the Christian, not to be courted, but not to be shunned. Love for<br>
 Christ takes precedence "over even the elemental instinct of<br>
 self-preservation" <b><i>(Ragg)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 14:27 <B>{His own cross}</B> <b><i>(\ton stauron heauto&#8211;\)</i></b>. This familiar<br>
 figure we have had already <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:23; Mr 8:34; Mt 10:38; 16:24)</i></b>.<br>
 Each follower has a cross which he must bear as Jesus did his.<br>
 \Bastaz&#333;\ is used of cross bearing in the N.T. only here<br>
 <b><i>(figuratively)</i></b> and <!-#-->Joh 19:17 literally of Jesus. Crucifixion<br>
 was common enough in Palestine since the days of Antiochus<br>
 Epiphanes and Alexander Jannaeus.<br>
 <br>
 14:28 <B>{Build a tower}</B> <b><i>(\purgon oikodom&#275;sai\)</i></b>. A common metaphor,<br>
 either a tower in the city wall like that by the Pool of Siloam<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 13:4)</i></b> or a watchtower in a vineyard <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 21:33)</i></b> or a<br>
 tower-shaped building for refuge or ornament as here. This<br>
 parable of the rash builder has the lesson of counting the cost.<br>
 <B>{Sit down}</B> <b><i>(\kathisas\)</i></b>. Attitude of deliberation. <B>{First}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pr&#333;ton\)</i></b>. First things first. So in verse <!-#-->31. <B>{Count}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ps&#275;phizei\)</i></b>. Common verb in late writers, but only here and <!-#-->Re<br>
 13:18 in the N.T. The verb is from \ps&#275;phos\, a stone, which was<br>
 used in voting and so counting. Calculate is from the Latin<br>
 _calculus_, a pebble. To vote was to cast a pebble <b><i>(\tith&#275;mi<br>
 ps&#275;phon\)</i></b>. Luke has Paul using "deposit a pebble" for casting his<br>
 vote <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 26:10)</i></b>. <B>{The cost}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n dapan&#275;n\)</i></b>. Old and common<br>
 word, but here only in the N.T. from \dapt&#333;\, to tear, consume,<br>
 devour. Expense is something which eats up one's resources.<br>
 <B>{Whether he hath wherewith to complete it}</B> <b><i>(\ei echei eis<br>
 apartismon\)</i></b>. If he has anything for completion of it.<br>
 \Apartismon\ is a rare and late word <b><i>(in the papyri and only here<br>
 in the N.T.)</i></b>. It is from \apartiz&#333;\, to finish off <b><i>(\ap-\ and<br>
 \artiz&#333;\ like our articulate)</i></b>, to make even or square. Cf.<br>
 \ex&#275;rtismenos\ in <!-#-->2Ti 3:17.<br>
 <br>
 14:29 <B>{Lest haply}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275;pote\)</i></b>. Double final particles<br>
 <b><i>(positive and negative with addition of \pote\)</i></b>. Used here with<br>
 aorist middle subjunctive in \arx&#333;ntai\ <b><i>(begin)</i></b>. <B>{When he hath<br>
 laid ... and was not able}</B> <b><i>(\thentos autou ... kai m&#275;<br>
 ischuontos\)</i></b> <B>{to finish}</B> <b><i>(\ektelesai\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 infinitive. Note perfective use of \ek\, to finish out to the<br>
 end. Two genitive absolutes, first, second aorist active<br>
 participle \thentos\; second, present active participle<br>
 \ischuontos\. <B>{To mock him}</B> <b><i>(\aut&#333;i empaizein\)</i></b>. An old verb,<br>
 \em-paiz&#333;\, to play like a child <b><i>(\pais\)</i></b>, at or with, to mock,<br>
 scoff at, to trifle with like Latin _illudere_.<br>
 <br>
 14:30 <B>{This man}</B> <b><i>(\houtos ho anthr&#333;pos\)</i></b>. This fellow,<br>
 contemptuous or sarcastic use of \houtos\.<br>
 <br>
 14:31 <B>{To encounter}</B> <b><i>(\sunbalein\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 infinitive of \sunball&#333;\, old and common verb, to throw or bring<br>
 together, to dispute, to clash in war as here. <B>{Another king}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\heter&#333;i basilei\)</i></b>, to grapple with another king in war or for<br>
 war <b><i>(\eis polemon\)</i></b>. Associative instrumental case. <B>{Take<br>
 counsel}</B> <b><i>(\bouleusetai\)</i></b>. Future middle indicative of old and<br>
 common verb \bouleu&#333;\, from \boul&#275;\, will, counsel. The middle<br>
 means to take counsel with oneself, to deliberate, to ponder.<br>
 <B>{With ten thousand}</B> <b><i>(\en deka chiliasin\)</i></b>. Literally, in ten<br>
 thousand. See this so-called instrumental use of \en\ in <!-#-->Jude<br>
 1:14. Equipped in or with ten thousand. See <!-#-->Lu 1:17. Note<br>
 \meta eikosi chiliad&#333;n\ just below <b><i>(midst of twenty thousand)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{To meet}</B> <b><i>(\hupant&#275;sai\)</i></b>. Common verb <b><i>(like \apanta&#333;\)</i></b> from<br>
 \anta&#333;\ <b><i>(\anta\, end, face to face, from which \anti\)</i></b> with<br>
 preposition \hupo\ <b><i>(or \apo\)</i></b>, to go to meet. Here it has a<br>
 military meaning.<br>
 <br>
 14:32 <B>{Or else}</B> <b><i>(\ei de m&#275;ge\)</i></b>. Same idiom in <!-#-->5:36. Luke is<br>
 fond of this formula. <B>{An ambassage}</B> <b><i>(\presbeian\)</i></b>. Old and<br>
 common word for the office of ambassador, composed of old men<br>
 <b><i>(\presbeis\)</i></b> like Japanese Elder Statesmen who are supposed to<br>
 possess wisdom. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 19:14. <B>{Asketh<br>
 conditions of peace}</B> <b><i>(\er&#333;t&#257;i pros eir&#275;n&#275;n\)</i></b>. The use of \er&#333;ta&#333;\<br>
 in this sense of beg or petition is common in the papyri and<br>
 _Koin&#275;_ generally. The original use of asking a question survives<br>
 also. The text is uncertain concerning \pros eir&#275;n&#275;n\ which means<br>
 with \er&#333;ta&#333;\, to ask negotiations for peace. In B we have \eis\<br>
 instead of \pros\ like verse <!-#-->28. Most MSS. have \ta\ before<br>
 \pros\ or \eis\, but not in Aleph and B. It is possible that the<br>
 \ta\ was omitted because of preceding \tai\ <b><i>(\homoeoteleuton\)</i></b>,<br>
 but the sense is the same. See <!-#-->Ro 14:19 \ta t&#275;s eir&#275;n&#275;s\, the<br>
 things of peace, which concern or look towards peace, the<br>
 preliminaries of peace.<br>
 <br>
 14:33 <B>{Renounceth not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk apotassetai\)</i></b>. Old Greek word to set<br>
 apart as in a military camp, then in the middle voice to separate<br>
 oneself from, say good-bye to <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:61)</i></b>, to renounce, forsake,<br>
 as here. <B>{All that he hath}</B> <b><i>(\pasin tois heautou huparchousin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Dative case, says good-bye to all his property, "all his own<br>
 belongings" <b><i>(neuter plural participle used as substantive)</i></b> as<br>
 named in verse <!-#-->26. This verse gives the principle in the two<br>
 parables of the rash builder and of the rash king. The minor<br>
 details do not matter. The spirit of self-sacrifice is the point.<br>
 <br>
 14:35 <B>{Dunghill}</B> <b><i>(\koprian\)</i></b>. Later word in the _Koin&#275;_<br>
 vernacular. Here only in the N.T., though in the LXX. <B>{Men cast<br>
 it out}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#333; ballousin auto\)</i></b>. Impersonal plural. This saying<br>
 about salt is another of Christ's repeated sayings <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:13; Mr<br>
 9:50)</i></b>. Another repeated saying is the one here about having ears<br>
 to hear <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:8; 14:35, Mt 11:15; 13:43)</i></b>.<br>
