<p>16:1 <B>{Now concerning the collection for the saints}</B> <b><i>(\peri de t&#275;s<br>
 logias t&#275;s eis tous hagious\)</i></b>. Paul has discussed all the<br>
 problems raised by the Corinthians. Now he has on his own heart<br>
 the collection for the saints in Jerusalem <b><i>(see chapters <!-#-->2Co 8;<br>
 9)</i></b>. This word \logia\ <b><i>(or \-eia\)</i></b> is now known to be derived<br>
 from a late verb \logeu&#333;\, to collect, recently found in papyri<br>
 and inscriptions <b><i>(Deissmann, _Bible Studies_, p. 143)</i></b>. The word<br>
 \logia\ is chiefly found in papyri, ostraca, and inscriptions<br>
 that tell of religious collections for a god or a temple<br>
 <b><i>(Deissmann, _Light from the Ancient East_, p. 105)</i></b>. The<br>
 introduction of this topic may seem sudden, but the Corinthians<br>
 were behind with their part of it. They may even have asked<br>
 further about it. Paul feels no conflict between discussion of<br>
 the resurrection and the collection. <B>{So also do ye}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s kai<br>
 humas poi&#275;sate\)</i></b>. Paul had given orders <b><i>(\dietaxa\)</i></b> to the<br>
 churches of Galatia and now gives them like commands. As a matter<br>
 of fact, they had promised a long time before this <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 8:10;<br>
 9:1-5)</i></b>. Now do what you pledged.<br>
 <br>
 16:2 <B>{Upon the first day of the week}</B> <b><i>(\kata mian sabbatou\)</i></b>. For<br>
 the singular \sabbatou\ <b><i>(sabbath)</i></b> for week see <!-#-->Lu 18:12; Mr<br>
 16:9. For the use of the cardinal \mian\ in sense of ordinal<br>
 \pr&#333;t&#275;n\ after Hebrew fashion in LXX <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 672)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Mr 16:2; Lu 24:1; Ac 20:7. Distributive use of<br>
 \kata\ also. <B>{Lay by him in store}</B> <b><i>(\par' heaut&#333;i tithet&#333;<br>
 th&#275;sauriz&#333;n\)</i></b>. By himself, in his home. Treasuring it <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mt<br>
 6:19f. for \th&#275;sauriz&#333;\)</i></b>. Have the habit of doing it, \tithet&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(present imperative)</i></b>. <B>{As he may prosper}</B> <b><i>(\hoti ean euod&#333;tai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Old verb from \eu\, well, and \hodos\, way or journey, to have a<br>
 good journey, to prosper in general, common in LXX. In N.T. only<br>
 here and <!-#-->Ro 1:10; 3Jo 1:2. It is uncertain what form \euod&#333;tai\<br>
 is, present passive subjunctive, perfect passive indicative, or<br>
 even perfect passive subjunctive <b><i>(Moulton, _Prolegomena_, p. 54)</i></b>.<br>
 The old MSS. had no accents. Some MSS. even have \euod&#333;th&#275;i\<br>
 <b><i>(first aorist passive subjunctive)</i></b>. But the sense is not altered.<br>
 \Hoti\ is accusative of general reference and \ean\ can occur<br>
 either with the subjunctive or indicative. This rule for giving<br>
 occurs also in <!-#-->2Co 8:12. Paul wishes the collections to be made<br>
 before he comes.<br>
 <br>
 16:3 <B>{When I arrive}</B> <b><i>(\hotan paragen&#333;mai\)</i></b>. Whenever I arrive,<br>
 indefinite temporal conjunction \hotan\ and second aorist middle<br>
 subjunctive. <B>{Whomsoever ye shall approve by letters}</B> <b><i>(\hous ean<br>
 dokimas&#275;te di' epistol&#333;n\)</i></b>. Indefinite relative with \ean\ and<br>
 aorist subjunctive of \dokimaz&#333;\ <b><i>(to test and so approve as in<br>
 <!-#-->Php 1:10)</i></b>. "By letters" to make it formal and regular and Paul<br>
 would approve their choice of messengers to go with him to<br>
 Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 8:20ff.)</i></b>. Curiously enough no names from Corinth<br>
 occur in the list in <!-#-->Ac 20:4. <B>{To carry}</B> <b><i>(\apenegkein\)</i></b>. Second<br>
 aorist active infinitive of \apopher&#333;\, to bear away. <B>{Bounty}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\charin\)</i></b>. Gift, grace, as in <!-#-->2Co 8:4-7. As a matter of fact,<br>
 the messengers of the churches <b><i>(\apostoloi ekkl&#275;si&#333;n\ <!-#-->2Co 8:23)</i></b><br>
 went along with Paul to Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:4f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:4 <B>{And if it be meet for me to go also}</B> <b><i>(\ean de axion &#275;i tou<br>
 kame poreuesthai\)</i></b>. "If the collection be worthy of the going as<br>
 to me also." Condition of third class <b><i>(\ean--&#275;i\)</i></b> and the<br>
 articular infinitive in the genitive <b><i>(\tou\)</i></b> after \axion\. The<br>
 accusative of general reference <b><i>(\kame\, me also)</i></b> with the<br>
 infinitive. So the awkward phrase clears up.<br>
 <br>
 16:5 <B>{When I shall have passed through Macedonia}</B> <b><i>(\hotan<br>
 Makedonian dielth&#333;\)</i></b>. "Whenever I pass through <b><i>(second aorist<br>
 active subjunctive of \dierchomai\)</i></b> Macedonia" <b><i>(see construction<br>
 in verse <!-#-->3)</i></b>. <B>{I do pass through}</B> <b><i>(\dierchomai\)</i></b>. I plan to pass<br>
 through, futuristic use of present indicative.<br>
 <br>
 16:6 <B>{It may be}</B> <b><i>(\tuchon\)</i></b>. Neuter accusative of second aorist<br>
 active participle of \tugchan&#333;\ used as an adverb <b><i>(in Plato and<br>
 Xenophon, but nowhere else in N.T.)</i></b>. <B>{Or even winter}</B> <b><i>(\&#275; kai<br>
 paracheimas&#333;\)</i></b>. Future active of late verb \paracheimaz&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(\cheim&#333;n\, winter)</i></b>. See on &#175;Ac 27:12; 28:11; Tit 3:12. He did<br>
 stay in Corinth for three months <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:3)</i></b>, probably the coming<br>
 winter. <B>{Whithersoever I go}</B> <b><i>(\hou ean poreu&#333;mai\)</i></b>. Indefinite<br>
 local clause with subjunctive. As a matter of fact, Paul had to<br>
 flee from a conspiracy in Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:3)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:7 <B>{Now by the way}</B> <b><i>(\arti en parod&#333;i\)</i></b>. Like our "by the way"<br>
 <b><i>(\parodos\)</i></b>, incidentally. <B>{If the Lord permit}</B> <b><i>(\ean ho Kurios<br>
 epitreps&#275;i\)</i></b>. Condition of the third class. Paul did everything<br>
 \en Kuri&#333;i\ <b><i>(Cf. <!-#-->Ac 18:21)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:8 <B>{Until Pentecost}</B> <b><i>(\he&#333;s t&#275;s Pent&#275;kost&#275;s\)</i></b>. He writes them<br>
 in the spring before pentecost. Apparently the uproar by<br>
 Demetrius hurried Paul away from Ephesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:1)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:9 <B>{For a great and effectual door is opened unto me}</B> <b><i>(\thura<br>
 gar moi ane&#333;igen megal&#275; kai energ&#275;s\)</i></b>. Second perfect active<br>
 indicative of \anoig&#333;\, to open. Intransitive, stands wide open<br>
 at last after his years there <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 20:31)</i></b>. A wide open door.<br>
 What does he mean by \energ&#275;s\? It is a late word in the _Koin&#275;_.<br>
 In the papyri a medical receipt has it for "tolerably strong."<br>
 The form \energos\ in the papyri is used of a mill "in working<br>
 order," of "tilled land," and of "wrought iron." In the N.T. it<br>
 occurs in <!-#-->Phm 1:6; Heb 4:12 of "the word of God" as "\energ&#275;s\"<br>
 <b><i>(powerful)</i></b>. Paul means that he has at least a great opportunity<br>
 for work in Ephesus. <B>{And there are many adversaries}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 antikeimenoi polloi\)</i></b>. "And many are lying opposed to me," lined<br>
 up against me. These Paul mentions as a reason for staying in,<br>
 not for leaving, Ephesus. Read <!-#-->Ac 19 and see the opposition<br>
 from Jews and Gentiles with the explosion under the lead of<br>
 Demetrius. And yet Paul suddenly leaves. He hints of much of<br>
 which we should like to know more <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 15:32; 2Co 1:8f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:10 <B>{That he be without fear}</B> <b><i>(\hina aphob&#333;s gen&#275;tai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Evidently he had reason to fear the treatment that Timothy might<br>
 receive in Corinth as shown in <!-#-->4:17-21.<br>
 <br>
 16:11 <B>{For I expect him}</B> <b><i>(\ekdechomai gar auton\)</i></b>. Apparently<br>
 later Timothy had to return to Ephesus without much success<br>
 before Paul left and was sent on to Macedonia with Erastus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 19:22)</i></b> and Titus sent to Corinth whom Paul then arranged to meet<br>
 in Troas <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 2:12)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:12 <B>{And it was not at all his will to come now}</B> <b><i>(\kai pant&#333;s<br>
 ouk &#275;n thel&#275;ma hina nun elth&#275;i\)</i></b>. Adversative use of \kai\ =<br>
 "but." Apollos had left Corinth in disgust over the strife there<br>
 which involved him and Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 1-4)</i></b>. He had had enough of<br>
 partisan strife over preachers.<br>
 <br>
 16:13 <B>{Watch ye}</B> <b><i>(\gr&#275;goreite\)</i></b>. Stay awake. Late present from<br>
 \egr&#275;gora\ second perfect of \egeir&#333;\, to awake. <B>{Quit you like<br>
 men}</B> <b><i>(\andrizesthe\)</i></b>. Play the man. Middle voice, show yourselves<br>
 men. From \an&#275;r\, a man.<br>
 <br>
 16:15 <B>{Ye know}</B> <b><i>(\oidate\)</i></b>. _Koin&#275;_ form for second perfect<br>
 indicative used as present of \hora&#333;\. Parenthetic clause through<br>
 rest of the verse. Stephanas is mentioned also in <!-#-->1:16 and in<br>
 <!-#-->16:17. For \aparch&#275;\ see on &#175;15:20,23. <B>{They have set<br>
 themselves}</B> <b><i>(\etaxan heautous\)</i></b>. Remarkable statement worthy of<br>
 attention today. This noble family appointed themselves to be<br>
 ministers to the saints that needed it <b><i>(the poor and needy)</i></b>.<br>
 Personal work for Christ is still the only way to win the world<br>
 for Christ, voluntary personal work. If all Christians did it!<br>
 <br>
 16:16 <B>{That ye also be in subjection unto such}</B> <b><i>(\hina kai humeis<br>
 hupotass&#275;sthe tois toioutois\)</i></b>. This is the exhortation begun in<br>
 verse <!-#-->15. The family of Stephanas took the lead in good works.<br>
 Do ye also follow such leaders. This is our great problem today,<br>
 to find great leaders and many loyal followers. This would solve<br>
 all church problems, great leadership and great following. Lend a<br>
 hand.<br>
 <br>
 16:17 <B>{At the coming}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;i parousi&#257;i\)</i></b>. At the coming here<br>
 of Stephanas, etc., the very word used of the \parousia\ of<br>
 Christ <b><i>(<!-#-->15:23)</i></b>. <B>{That which was lacking on your part they<br>
 supplied}</B> <b><i>(\to humeteron huster&#275;ma houtoi anepl&#275;r&#333;san\)</i></b>. Either<br>
 "these filled up my lack of you" or "these filled up your lack of<br>
 me." Either makes perfectly good sense and both were true. Which<br>
 Paul meant we cannot tell.<br>
 <br>
 16:18 <B>{For they refreshed my spirit and yours}</B> <b><i>(\anepausan gar to<br>
 emon pneuma kai to hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. They did both. The very verb used by<br>
 Jesus in <!-#-->Mt 11:28 for the refreshment offered by him to those<br>
 who come to him, fellowship with Jesus, and here fellowship with<br>
 each other.<br>
 <br>
 16:19 <B>{The churches of Asia}</B> <b><i>(\hai ekkl&#275;siai t&#275;s Asias\)</i></b>. True of<br>
 the Roman province <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 10:10,26; Col 1:6; 2:1; 4:13,16)</i></b>. The<br>
 gospel spread rapidly from Ephesus. <B>{With the church that is in<br>
 their house}</B> <b><i>(\sun t&#275;i kat' oikon aut&#333;n ekkl&#275;si&#257;i\)</i></b>. Paul had<br>
 long ago left the synagogue for the school house of Tyrannus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 19:9)</i></b>. But Aquila and Prisca opened their house here for the<br>
 services. The churches had to meet where they could. Paul had<br>
 laboured and lived with this family in Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:2)</i></b> and<br>
 now again in Ephesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:19; 20:34)</i></b>. It was their habit<br>
 wherever they lived <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 16:5)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 16:20 <B>{With a holy kiss}</B> <b><i>(\en phil&#275;mati hagi&#333;i\)</i></b>. In the<br>
 synagogue men kissed men and women kissed women. This was the<br>
 Christian custom at a later date and apparently so here. See <!-#-->1Th<br>
 5:26; 2Co 13:12; Ro 3:8; 1Pe 5:14. It seems never to have been<br>
 promiscuous between the sexes.<br>
 <br>
 16:21 <B>{Of me Paul with mine own hand}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i em&#275;i cheiri Paulou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "With the hand of me Paul." The genitive \Paulou\ is<br>
 in apposition with the possessive pronoun \em&#275;i\ which is in the<br>
 instrumental case just as in <!-#-->2Th 3:17, the sign in every<br>
 Epistle. He dictated, but signed at the end. If we only had that<br>
 signature on that scrap of paper.<br>
 <br>
 16:22 \Anathema\. The word seems a bit harsh to us, but the<br>
 refusal to love Christ <b><i>(\ou philei\)</i></b> on the part of a nominal<br>
 Christian deserves \anathema\ <b><i>(see on &#175;12:3 for this word)</i></b>.<br>
 \Maran atha\. This Aramaic phrase means "Our Lord <b><i>(\maran\)</i></b><br>
 cometh <b><i>(\atha\)</i></b>" or, used as a proleptic perfect, "has come." It<br>
 seems to be a sort of watchword <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->1Th 4:14ff.; Jas 5:7f.; Php<br>
 4:5; Re 1:7; 3:11; 22:20)</i></b>, expressing the lively hope that the<br>
 Lord will come. It was a curious blunder in the King James<br>
 Version that connected \Maran atha\ with \Anathema\.<br>
