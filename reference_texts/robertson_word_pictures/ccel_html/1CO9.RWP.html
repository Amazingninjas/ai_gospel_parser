 <HR>
<p>9:1 <B>{Am I not free?}</B> <b><i>(\Ouk eimi eleutheros;\)</i></b>. Free as a<br>
 Christian from Mosaic ceremonialism <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->9:19)</i></b> as much as any<br>
 Christian and yet he adapts his moral independence to the<br>
 principle of considerate love in <!-#-->8:13. <B>{Am I not an apostle?}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ouk eimi apostolos;\)</i></b>. He has the exceptional privileges as an<br>
 apostle to support from the churches and yet he foregoes these.<br>
 <B>{Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?}</B> <b><i>(\ouchi I&#275;soun ton Kurion h&#275;m&#333;n<br>
 heoraka;\)</i></b>. Proof <b><i>(<!-#-->15:8; Ac 9:17,27; 18:9; 22:14,17f.; 2Co<br>
 12:1ff.)</i></b> that he has the qualification of an apostle <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 1:22)</i></b><br>
 though not one of the twelve. Note strong form of the negative<br>
 \ouchi\ here. All these questions expect an affirmative answer.<br>
 The perfect active \heoraka\ from \hora&#333;\, to see, does not here<br>
 have double reduplication as in <!-#-->Joh 1:18.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{Are not ye?}</B> <b><i>(\ou humeis este;\)</i></b>. They were themselves proof of<br>
 his apostleship.<br>
 <br>
 9:2 <B>{Yet at least I am to you}</B> <b><i>(\alla ge humin eimi\)</i></b>. An<br>
 _argumentum ad hominem_ and a pointed appeal for their support.<br>
 Note use of \alla ge\ in the apodosis <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->8:6)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:3 <B>{My defence}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; em&#275; apologia\)</i></b>. Original sense, not idea of<br>
 apologizing as we say. See on &#175;Ac 22:1; 25:16. Refers to what<br>
 precedes and to what follows as illustration of <!-#-->8:13. <B>{To them<br>
 that examine me}</B> <b><i>(\tois eme anakrinousin\)</i></b>. See on &#175;1Co 2:15;<br>
 4:3. The critics in Corinth were "investigating" Paul with sharp<br>
 eyes to find faults. How often the pastor is under the critic's<br>
 spy-glass.<br>
 <br>
 9:4 <B>{Have we no right?}</B> <b><i>(\M&#275; ouk echomen exousian;\)</i></b>. Literary<br>
 plural here though singular in <!-#-->1-3. The \m&#275;\ in this double<br>
 negative expects the answer "No" while \ouk\ goes with the verb<br>
 \echomen\. "Do we fail to have the right?" Cf. <!-#-->Ro 10:18f.<br>
 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1173)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:5 <B>{Have we no right?}</B> <b><i>(\M&#275; ouk echomen exousian;\)</i></b>. Same idiom.<br>
 <B>{To lead about a wife that is a believer?}</B> <b><i>(\adelph&#275;n gunaika<br>
 periagein;\)</i></b>. Old verb \periag&#333;\, intransitive in <!-#-->Ac 13:11. Two<br>
 substantives in apposition, a sister a wife, a common Greek<br>
 idiom. This is a plea for the support of the preacher's wife and<br>
 children. Plainly Paul has no wife at this time. <B>{And Cephas}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai K&#275;ph&#257;s\)</i></b>. Why is he singled out by name? Perhaps because of<br>
 his prominence and because of the use of his name in the<br>
 divisions in Corinth <b><i>(<!-#-->1:12)</i></b>. It was well known that Peter was<br>
 married <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 8:14)</i></b>. Paul mentions James by name in <!-#-->Ga 1:19 as<br>
 one of the Lord's brothers. All the other apostles were either<br>
 married or had the right to be.<br>
 <br>
 9:6 <B>{Have we not a right to forbear working?}</B> <b><i>(\ouk echomen<br>
 exousian m&#275; ergazesthai;\)</i></b>. By \&#275;\ <b><i>(or)</i></b> Paul puts the other side<br>
 about Barnabas <b><i>(the only allusion since the dispute in <!-#-->Ac<br>
 15:39, but in good spirit)</i></b> and himself. Perhaps <b><i>(Hofmann)</i></b> Paul<br>
 has in mind the fact that in the first great mission tour <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 13; 14)</i></b>, Barnabas and Paul received no help from the church in<br>
 Antioch, but were left to work their way along at their own<br>
 charges. It was not till the Philippian Church took hold that<br>
 Paul had financial aid <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 4:15)</i></b>. Here both negatives have<br>
 their full force. Literally, Do we not have <b><i>(\ouk echomen\,<br>
 expecting the affirmative reply)</i></b> the right not <b><i>(\m&#275;\, negative of<br>
 the infinitive \ergazesthai\)</i></b> to do manual labour <b><i>(usual meaning<br>
 of \ergazomai\ as in <!-#-->4:12)</i></b>?" There was no more compulsion on<br>
 Paul and Barnabas to support themselves than upon the other<br>
 workers for Christ. They renounced no rights in being voluntarily<br>
 independent.<br>
 <br>
 9:7 <B>{What soldier ever serveth?}</B> <b><i>(\tis strateuetai pote;\)</i></b>. "Who<br>
 ever serves as a soldier?" serves in an army <b><i>(\stratos\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 middle of old verb \strateu&#333;\. <B>{At his own charges}</B> <b><i>(\idiois<br>
 ops&#333;niois\)</i></b>. This late word \ops&#333;nion\ <b><i>(from \opson\, cooked meat<br>
 or relish with bread, and \&#333;neomai\, to buy)</i></b> found in Menander,<br>
 Polybius, and very common in papyri and inscriptions in the sense<br>
 of rations or food, then for the soldiers' wages <b><i>(often<br>
 provisions)</i></b> or the pay of any workman. So of the wages of sin<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 6:23)</i></b>. Paul uses \lab&#333;n ops&#333;nion\ <b><i>(receiving wages, the<br>
 regular idiom)</i></b> in <!-#-->2Co 11:8. See Moulton and Milligan,<br>
 _Vocabulary_; Deissmann, _Bible Studies_, pp. 148,266; _Light<br>
 from the Ancient East_, p. 168. To give proof of his right to<br>
 receive pay for preaching Paul uses the illustrations of the<br>
 soldier <b><i>(verse <!-#-->7)</i></b>, the husbandman <b><i>(verse <!-#-->7)</i></b>, the shepherd<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->7)</i></b>, the ox treading out the grain <b><i>(<!-#-->8)</i></b>, the ploughman<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->10)</i></b>, the priests in the temple <b><i>(<!-#-->13)</i></b>, proof enough in<br>
 all conscience, and yet not enough for some churches who even<br>
 today starve their pastors in the name of piety. <B>{Who planteth a<br>
 vineyard?}</B> <b><i>(\tis phuteuei ampel&#333;na;\)</i></b>. \Ampel&#333;n\ no earlier than<br>
 Diodorus, but in LXX and in papyri. Place of vines <b><i>(\ampelos\)</i></b>,<br>
 meaning of ending \-&#333;n\. <B>{Who feedeth a flock?}</B> <b><i>(\tis poimainei<br>
 poimn&#275;n;\)</i></b>. Cognate accusative, both old words. Paul likens the<br>
 pastor to a soldier, vinedresser, shepherd. He contends with the<br>
 world, he plants churches, he exercises a shepherd's care over<br>
 them <b><i>(Vincent)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:8 <B>{Do I speak these things after the manner of men?}</B> <b><i>(\M&#275; kata<br>
 anthr&#333;pon tauta lal&#333;;\)</i></b>. Negative answer expected. Paul uses<br>
 \kata anthr&#333;pon\ six times <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 3:3; 9:8; 15:32; Gal 1:11; 3:15;<br>
 Ro 3:5)</i></b>. The illustrations from human life are pertinent, but he<br>
 has some of a higher order, from Scripture. <B>{The law also}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 ho nomos\)</i></b>. Perhaps objection was made that the Scripture does<br>
 not support the practice of paying preachers. That objection is<br>
 still made by the stingy.<br>
 <br>
 9:9 <B>{Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ou phim&#333;seis boun alo&#333;nta\)</i></b>. Quotation from <!-#-->De 25:4.<br>
 Prohibition by \ou\ and the volitive future indicative. \Phimo&#333;\,<br>
 to muzzle <b><i>(from \phimos\, a muzzle for dogs and oxen)</i></b>, appears<br>
 first in Aristophanes <b><i>(_Clouds_, 592)</i></b> and not again till LXX and<br>
 N.T., though in the papyri also. Evidently a vernacular word,<br>
 perhaps a slang word. See metaphorical use in <!-#-->Mt 22:12,34.<br>
 \Alo&#333;nta\ is present active participle of the old verb \aloa&#333;\,<br>
 occurs in the N.T. only here <b><i>(and verse <!-#-->10)</i></b> and <!-#-->1Ti 5:18<br>
 where it is also quoted. It is probably derived from \halos\ or<br>
 \halon\, a threshing-floor, or the disc of a shield or of the sun<br>
 and moon. The Egyptians according to the monuments, used oxen to<br>
 thresh out the grain, sometimes donkeys, by pulling a drag over<br>
 the grain. The same process may be found today in Andalusia,<br>
 Italy, Palestine. A hieroglyphic inscription at Eileithyas reads:<br>
 <br>
         "Thresh ye yourselves, O oxen,<br>
          Measures of grain for yourselves,<br>
          Measures of grain for your masters."<br>
 <br>
 Note \m&#275; melei\ expects the negative answer, impersonal verb with<br>
 dative and genitive cases <b><i>(\theoi\, God, \bo&#333;n\, oxen)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Altogether}</B> <b><i>(\pant&#333;s\)</i></b>. But here probably with the notion of<br>
 doubtless or assuredly. The editors differ in the verse divisions<br>
 here. The Canterbury Version puts both these questions in verse<br>
 <!-#-->10, the American Standard the first in verse <!-#-->9, the second in<br>
 verse <!-#-->10.<br>
 <br>
 9:10 <B>{He that plougheth}</B> <b><i>(\ho arotri&#333;n\)</i></b>. Late verb \arotria&#333;\,<br>
 to plough, for the old \aro&#333;\ from \arotron\ <b><i>(plough)</i></b>, in LXX and<br>
 rare in papyri. <B>{In hope of partaking}</B> <b><i>(\ep' elpidi tou<br>
 metechein\)</i></b>. The infinitive \alo&#257;in\ is not repeated nor is<br>
 \opheilei\ though it is understood, "He that thresheth ought to<br>
 thresh in hope of partaking." He that ploughs hardly refers to<br>
 the ox at the plough as he that threshes does. The point is that<br>
 all the workers <b><i>(beast or man)</i></b> share in the fruit of the toil.<br>
 <br>
 9:11 <B>{Is it a great matter?}</B> <b><i>(\mega;\)</i></b>. The copula \estin\ has to<br>
 be supplied. Note two conditions of first class with \ei\, both<br>
 assumed to be true. On \pneumatika\ and \sarkika\ see on &#175;2:14;<br>
 3:3. This point comes out sharply also in <!-#-->Ga 6:6.<br>
 <br>
 9:12 <B>{Over you}</B> <b><i>(\hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Objective genitive after \exousian\.<br>
 <B>{Do not we yet more?}</B> <b><i>(\ou mallon h&#275;meis;\)</i></b>. Because of Paul's<br>
 peculiar relation to that church as founder and apostle. <B>{But we<br>
 bear all things}</B> <b><i>(\alla panta stegomen\)</i></b>. Old verb to cover<br>
 <b><i>(\steg&#275;\, roof)</i></b> and so to cover up, to conceal, to endure <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co<br>
 13:7 of love)</i></b>. Paul deliberately declined to use <b><i>(usual<br>
 instrumental case with \chraomai\)</i></b> his right to pay in Corinth.<br>
 <B>{That we may cause no hindrance}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275; tina enkop&#275;n d&#333;men\)</i></b>.<br>
 Late word \enkop&#275;\, a cutting in <b><i>(cf. _radio_ or telephone)</i></b> or<br>
 hindrance from \enkopt&#333;\, to cut in, rare word <b><i>(like \ekkop&#275;\)</i></b><br>
 here only in N.T. and once in Vettius Valens. How considerate<br>
 Paul is to avoid "a hindrance to the gospel of Christ" <b><i>(\t&#333;i<br>
 euaggeli&#333;i tou Christou\, dative case and genitive)</i></b> rather than<br>
 insist on his personal rights and liberties, an eloquent example<br>
 for all modern men.<br>
 <br>
 9:13 <B>{Sacred things}</B> <b><i>(\ta hiera\)</i></b>. <B>{Of the temple}</B> <b><i>(\tou<br>
 hierou\)</i></b>. Play on the same word \hierou\ <b><i>(sacred)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Nu<br>
 18:8-20 for the details. This is a very pertinent illustration.<br>
 <B>{They which wait upon the altar}</B> <b><i>(\hoi t&#333;i thusiast&#275;ri&#333;i<br>
 paredreuontes\)</i></b>. Old word \paredreu&#333;\, to sit beside, from<br>
 \par--edros\, like Latin _assidere_, and so constant attendance.<br>
 Only here in the N.T. Locative case \thusiast&#275;ri&#333;i\, late word<br>
 found so far only in LXX, Philo, Josephus, N.T., and<br>
 ecclesiastical writers. See on &#175;Mt 5:23.<br>
 <br>
 9:14 <B>{Even so did the Lord ordain}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s kai ho Kurios<br>
 dietaxen\)</i></b>. Just as God gave orders about the priests in the<br>
 temple, so did the Lord Jesus give orders for those who preach<br>
 the gospel to live out of the gospel <b><i>(\ek tou euaggeliou z&#275;in\)</i></b>.<br>
 Evidently Paul was familiar with the words of Jesus in <!-#-->Mt 10:10;<br>
 Lu 10:7f. either in oral or written form. He has made his<br>
 argument for the minister's salary complete for all time.<br>
 <br>
 9:15 <B>{For it were good for me to die, than that any man should<br>
 make my glorying void}</B> <b><i>(\kalon gar moi mallon apothanein &#275; to<br>
 kauch&#275;ma mou oudeis ken&#333;sei\)</i></b>. The tangled syntax of this<br>
 sentence reflects the intensity of Paul's feeling on the subject.<br>
 He repeats his refusal to use his privileges and rights to a<br>
 salary by use of the present perfect middle indicative<br>
 <b><i>(\kechr&#275;mai\)</i></b>. By the epistolary aorist <b><i>(\egrapsa\)</i></b> he explains<br>
 that he is not now hinting for a change on their part towards him<br>
 in the matter, "in my case" <b><i>(\en emoi\)</i></b>. Then he gives his reason<br>
 in vigorous language without a copula <b><i>(\&#275;n\, were)</i></b>: "For good for<br>
 me to die rather than," but here he changes the construction by a<br>
 violent anacoluthon. Instead of another infinitive <b><i>(\ken&#333;sai\)</i></b><br>
 after \&#275;\ <b><i>(than)</i></b> he changes to the future indicative without<br>
 \hoti\ or \hina\, "No one shall make my glorying void," viz., his<br>
 independence of help from them. \Keno&#333;\ is an old verb, from<br>
 \kenos\, empty, only in Paul in N.T. See on &#175;1Co 1:17.<br>
 <br>
 9:16 <B>{For if I preach}</B> <b><i>(\ean gar euaggeliz&#333;mai\)</i></b>. Third class<br>
 condition, supposable case. Same construction in verse <!-#-->16 <b><i>(\ean<br>
 m&#275;\)</i></b>. <B>{For necessity is laid upon me}</B> <b><i>(\anagk&#275; gar moi<br>
 epikeitai\)</i></b>. Old verb, lies upon me <b><i>(dative case \moi\)</i></b>. Jesus<br>
 had called him <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 9:6,15; Ga 1:15f.; Ro 1:14)</i></b>. He could do no<br>
 other and deserves no credit for doing it. <B>{Woe is me}</B> <b><i>(\ouai gar<br>
 moi\)</i></b>. Explaining the \anagk&#275;\ <b><i>(necessity)</i></b>. Paul had to heed the<br>
 call of Christ that he had heard. He had a real call to the<br>
 ministry. Would that this were the case with every modern<br>
 preacher.<br>
 <br>
 9:17 <B>{Of mine own will}</B> <b><i>(\hek&#333;n\)</i></b> <B>{--not of mine own will}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ak&#333;n\)</i></b>. Both common adjectives, but only here in N.T. save<br>
 \hek&#333;n\, also in <!-#-->Ro 8:20. The argument is not wholly clear.<br>
 Paul's call was so clear that he certainly did his work<br>
 <B>{willingly}</B> and so had a reward <b><i>(see on &#175;Mt 6:1 for \misthos\)</i></b>;<br>
 but the only <B>{reward}</B> that he had for his willing work <b><i>(Marcus<br>
 Dods)</i></b> was to make the gospel <B>{free of expense}</B> <b><i>(\adapanon\, verse<br>
 <!-#-->18, rare word, here only in N.T., once in inscription at<br>
 Priene)</i></b>. This was his \misthos\. It was glorying <b><i>(\kauch&#275;ma\, to<br>
 be able to say so as in <!-#-->Ac 20:33f.)</i></b>. <B>{I have a stewardship<br>
 intrusted to me}</B> <b><i>(\oikonomian pepisteumai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 indicative with the accusative retained. I have been intrusted<br>
 with a stewardship and so would go on with my task like any<br>
 \oikonomos\ <b><i>(steward)</i></b> even if \ak&#333;n\ <b><i>(unwilling)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:18 <B>{So as not to use to the full}</B> <b><i>(\eis to m&#275;<br>
 katachr&#275;sasthai\)</i></b>. \Eis to\ for purpose with articular infinitive<br>
 and perfective use of \kata\ <b><i>(as in <!-#-->7:31)</i></b> with \chr&#275;sasthai\<br>
 <b><i>(first aorist middle infinitive)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:19 <B>{I brought myself under bondage}</B> <b><i>(\emauton edoul&#333;sa\)</i></b>.<br>
 Voluntary bondage, I enslaved myself to all, though free.<br>
 Causative verb in \-o&#333;\ <b><i>(\doulo&#333;\, from \doulos\)</i></b>. The more<br>
 <b><i>(\tous pleionas\)</i></b>. Than he could have done otherwise. Every<br>
 preacher faces this problem of his personal attitude and conduct.<br>
 Note \kerd&#275;s&#333;\ <b><i>(as in verses <!-#-->20,21,22, but once \hina kerdan&#333;\<br>
 in <!-#-->21, regular liquid future of \kerdain&#333;\)</i></b> with \hina\ is<br>
 probably future active indicative <b><i>(<!-#-->Jas 4:13)</i></b>, though Ionic<br>
 aorist active subjunctive from \kerda&#333;\ is possible <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 18:15)</i></b>.<br>
 "He refuses payment in money that he may make the greater gain in<br>
 souls" <b><i>(Edwards)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:20 <B>{As a Jew}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s Ioudaios\)</i></b>. He was a Jew and was not<br>
 ashamed of it <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:18; 21:26)</i></b>. <B>{Not being myself under the<br>
 law}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; &#333;n autos hupo nomon\)</i></b>. He was emancipated from the law<br>
 as a means of salvation, yet he knew how to speak to them because<br>
 of his former beliefs and life with them <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 4:21)</i></b>. He knew how<br>
 to put the gospel to them without compromise and without offence.<br>
 <br>
 9:21 <B>{To them that are without law}</B> <b><i>(\tois anomois\)</i></b>. The<br>
 heathen, those outside the Mosaic law <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 2:14)</i></b>, not lawless<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 22:37; Ac 2:23; 1Ti 1:9)</i></b>. See how Paul bore himself with<br>
 the pagans <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 14:15; 17:23; 24:25)</i></b>, and how he quoted heathen<br>
 poets. "Not being an outlaw of God, but an inlaw of Christ"<br>
 <b><i>(Evans, Estius has it _exlex, inlex_, \m&#275; &#333;n anomos theou, all'<br>
 ennomos Christou\)</i></b>. The genitive case of \theou\ and \Christou\<br>
 <b><i>(specifying case)</i></b> comes out better thus, for it seems unusual<br>
 with \anomos\ and \ennomos\, both old and regular adjectives.<br>
 <br>
 9:22 <B>{I became weak}</B> <b><i>(\egenom&#275;n asthen&#275;s\)</i></b>. This is the chief<br>
 point, the climax in his plea for the principle of love on the<br>
 part of the enlightened for the benefit of the unenlightened<br>
 <b><i>(chapter <!-#-->1Co 8)</i></b>. He thus brings home his conduct about<br>
 renouncing pay for preaching as an illustration of love <b><i>(<!-#-->8:13)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{All things}</B> <b><i>(\panta\)</i></b> <B>{to all men}</B> <b><i>(\tois pasin\, the whole<br>
 number)</i></b> <B>{by all means}</B> <b><i>(\pant&#333;s\)</i></b>. Pointed play on the word all,<br>
 <B>{that I may save some}</B> <b><i>(\hina tinas s&#333;s&#333;\)</i></b>. This his goal and<br>
 worth all the cost of adaptation. In matters of principle Paul<br>
 was adamant as about Titus the Greek <b><i>(<!-#-->Ga 2:5)</i></b>. In matters of<br>
 expediency as about Timothy <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 16:3)</i></b> he would go half way to<br>
 win and to hold. This principle was called for in dealing with<br>
 the problem of eating meat offered to idols <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 14:1; 15:1; 1Th<br>
 5:14)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:23 <B>{That I may be a joint partaker thereof}</B> <b><i>(\hina sunkoin&#333;nos<br>
 autou gen&#333;mai\)</i></b>. Literally, That I may become co-partner with<br>
 others in the gospel. The point is that he may be able to share<br>
 the gospel with others, his evangelistic passion. \Sunkoin&#333;nos\<br>
 is a compound word <b><i>(\sun\, together with, \koin&#333;nos\, partner or<br>
 sharer)</i></b>. We have two genitives with it in <!-#-->Php 1:7, though \en\<br>
 and the locative is used in <!-#-->Re 1:9. It is found only in the<br>
 N.T. and a late papyrus. Paul does not wish to enjoy the gospel<br>
 just by himself.<br>
 <br>
 9:24 <B>{In a race}</B> <b><i>(\en stadi&#333;i\)</i></b>. Old word from \hist&#275;mi\, to<br>
 place. A stated or fixed distance, 606 3/4 feet, both masculine<br>
 \stadioi\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 14:24; Lu 24:13)</i></b> and neuter as here. Most of the<br>
 Greek cities had race-courses for runners like that at Olympia.<br>
 <B>{The prize}</B> <b><i>(\to brabeion\)</i></b>. Late word, in inscriptions and<br>
 papyri. Latin _brabeum_. In N. T. only here and <!-#-->Php 3:14. The<br>
 victor's prize which only one could receive. <B>{That ye may attain}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hina katalab&#275;te\)</i></b>. Final use of \hina\ and perfective use of<br>
 \kata-\ with \lab&#275;te\ <b><i>(effective aorist active subjunctive, grasp<br>
 and hold)</i></b>. Old verb \katalamban&#333;\ and used in <!-#-->Php 3:12ff.<br>
 <br>
 9:25 <B>{That striveth in the games}</B> <b><i>(\ho ag&#333;nizomenos\)</i></b>. Common<br>
 verb for contest in the athletic games <b><i>(\ag&#333;n\)</i></b>, sometimes with<br>
 the cognate accusative, \ag&#333;na ag&#333;nizomai\ as in <!-#-->1Ti 6:12; 2Ti<br>
 4:7. Probably Paul often saw these athletic games. <B>{Is temperate<br>
 in all things}</B> <b><i>(\panta egkrateuetai\)</i></b>. Rare verb, once in<br>
 Aristotle and in a late Christian inscription, and <!-#-->1Co 7:9 and<br>
 here, from \egkrat&#275;s\, common adjective for one who controls<br>
 himself. The athlete then and now has to control himself <b><i>(direct<br>
 middle)</i></b> in all things <b><i>(accusative of general reference)</i></b>. This is<br>
 stated by Paul as an athletic axiom. Training for ten months was<br>
 required under the direction of trained judges. Abstinence from<br>
 wine was required and a rigid diet and regimen of habits.<br>
 <br>
 <B>{A corruptible crown}</B> <b><i>(\phtharton stephanon\)</i></b>. \Stephanos\<br>
 <b><i>(crown)</i></b> is from \steph&#333;\, to put around the head, like the Latin<br>
 _corona_, wreath or garland, badge of victory in the games. In<br>
 the Isthmian games it was of pine leaves, earlier of parsley, in<br>
 the Olympian games of the wild olive. "Yet these were the most<br>
 coveted honours in the whole Greek world" <b><i>(Findlay)</i></b>. For the<br>
 crown of thorns on Christ's head see <!-#-->Mt 27:29; Mr 15:17; Joh<br>
 19:2,5. \Diad&#275;ma\ <b><i>(diadem)</i></b> was for kings <b><i>(<!-#-->Re 12:3)</i></b>. Favourite<br>
 metaphor in N.T., the crown of righteousness <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 4:8)</i></b>, the<br>
 crown of life <b><i>(<!-#-->Jas 1:12)</i></b>, the crown of glory <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 5:4)</i></b>, the<br>
 crown of rejoicing <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 2:9)</i></b>, description of the Philippians<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 4:1)</i></b>. Note contrast between \phtharton\ <b><i>(verbal adjective<br>
 from \phtheir&#333;\, to corrupt)</i></b> like the garland of pine leaves,<br>
 wild olive, or laurel, and \aphtharton\ <b><i>(same form with \a\<br>
 privative)</i></b> like the crown of victory offered the Christian, the<br>
 amaranthine <b><i>(unfading rose)</i></b> crown of glory <b><i>(<!-#-->1Pe 5:4)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 9:26 <B>{So}</B> <b><i>(\hout&#333;s\)</i></b>. Both with \trech&#333;\ <b><i>(run)</i></b> and \pukteu&#333;\<br>
 <b><i>(fight)</i></b>. <B>{As not uncertainly}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s ouk ad&#275;l&#333;s\)</i></b>. Instead of<br>
 exhorting them further Paul describes his own conduct as a runner<br>
 in the race. He explains \hout&#333;s\. \Ad&#275;l&#333;s\ old adverb, only here<br>
 in N.T. His objective is clear, with Christ as the goal <b><i>(<!-#-->Php<br>
 3:14)</i></b>. He kept his eye on Christ as Christ watched him. <B>{Fight}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pukteu&#333;\)</i></b>. Paul changes the metaphor from the runner to the<br>
 boxer. Old verb <b><i>(only here in N.T.)</i></b> from \pukt&#275;s\ <b><i>(pugilist)</i></b> and<br>
 that from \pugm&#275;\ <b><i>(fist)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mr 7:3)</i></b>. <B>{As not beating the<br>
 air}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s ouk aera der&#333;n\)</i></b>. A boxer did this when practising<br>
 without an adversary <b><i>(cf. doing "the daily dozen")</i></b> and this was<br>
 called "shadow-fighting" <b><i>(\skiamachia\)</i></b>. He smote something more<br>
 solid than air. Probably \ou\ negatives \aera\, though it still<br>
 occurs with the participle as a strong and positive negative.<br>
 <br>
 9:27 <B>{But I buffet my body}</B> <b><i>(\alla hup&#333;piaz&#333; mou to s&#333;ma\)</i></b>. In<br>
 Aristophanes, Aristotle, Plutarch, from \hup&#333;pion\, and that from<br>
 \hupo\ and \ops\ <b><i>(in papyri)</i></b>, the part of the face under the<br>
 eyes, a blow in the face, to beat black and blue. In N.T. only<br>
 here and <!-#-->Lu 18:5 which see. Paul does not, like the Gnostics,<br>
 consider his \sarx\ or his \s&#333;ma\ sinful and evil. But "it is<br>
 like the horses in a chariot race, which must be kept well in<br>
 hand by whip and rein if the prize is to be secured" <b><i>(Robertson<br>
 and Plummer)</i></b>. The boxers often used boxing gloves <b><i>(\cestus\, of<br>
 ox-hide bands)</i></b> which gave telling blows. Paul was not willing for<br>
 his body to be his master. He found good as the outcome of this<br>
 self-discipline <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 12:7; Ro 8:13; Col 2:23; 3:5)</i></b>. <B>{And bring<br>
 it into bondage}</B> <b><i>(\kai doulag&#333;g&#333;\)</i></b>. Late compound verb from<br>
 \doulag&#333;gos\, in Diodorus Siculus, Epictetus and substantive in<br>
 papyri. It is the metaphor of the victor leading the vanquished<br>
 as captive and slave. <B>{Lest by any means}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275; p&#333;s\)</i></b>. Common<br>
 conjunction for negative purpose with subjunctive as here<br>
 <b><i>(\gen&#333;mai\, second aorist middle)</i></b>. <B>{After that I have preached to<br>
 others}</B> <b><i>(\allois k&#275;r&#8211;xas\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle of<br>
 \k&#275;russ&#333;\ <b><i>(see on &#175;1:23)</i></b>, common verb to preach, from word<br>
 \k&#275;rux\ <b><i>(herald)</i></b> and that is probably the idea here. A \k&#275;rux\ at<br>
 the games announced the rules of the game and called out the<br>
 competitors. So Paul is not merely a herald, but a competitor<br>
 also. <B>{I myself should be rejected}</B> <b><i>(\autos adokimos gen&#333;mai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, "I myself should become rejected." \Adokimos\ is an<br>
 old adjective used of metals, coin, soil <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 6:8)</i></b> and in a<br>
 moral sense only by Paul in N.T. <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 9:27; 2Co 13:5-7; Ro 1:28;<br>
 Tit 1:16; 2Ti 3:8)</i></b>. It means not standing the test <b><i>(\dokimos\<br>
 from \dokimaz&#333;\)</i></b>. Paul means rejected for the <B>{prize}</B>, not for<br>
 the entrance to the race. He will fail to win if he breaks the<br>
 rules of the game <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 7:22f.)</i></b>. What is the prize before Paul?<br>
 Is it that <B>{reward}</B> <b><i>(\misthos\)</i></b> of which he spoke in verse <!-#-->18,<br>
 his glorying of preaching a free gospel? So Edwards argues. Most<br>
 writers take Paul to refer to the possibility of his rejection in<br>
 his personal salvation at the end of the race. He does not claim<br>
 absolute perfection <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 3:12)</i></b> and so he presses on. At the end<br>
 he has serene confidence <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ti 4:7)</i></b> with the race run and won.<br>
 It is a humbling thought for us all to see this wholesome fear<br>
 instead of smug complacency in this greatest of all heralds of<br>
 Christ.<br>
