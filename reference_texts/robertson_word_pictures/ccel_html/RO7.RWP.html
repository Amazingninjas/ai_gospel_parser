 <HR>
<p>7:1 <B>{To men that know the law}</B> <b><i>(\gin&#333;skousin nomon\)</i></b>. Dative<br>
 plural of present active participle of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\. The Romans,<br>
 whether Jews or Gentiles, knew the principle of law. <B>{A man}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\tou anthr&#333;pou\)</i></b>. "The person," generic term \anthr&#333;pos\, not<br>
 \an&#275;r\.<br>
 <br>
 7:2 <B>{The wife that hath a husband}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; hupandros gun&#275;\)</i></b>. Late<br>
 word, under <b><i>(in subjection to)</i></b> a husband. Here only in N.T. <B>{Is<br>
 bound}</B> <b><i>(\dedetai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative, stands bound. <B>{By<br>
 law}</B> <b><i>(\nom&#333;i\)</i></b>. Instrumental case. <B>{To the husband while he<br>
 liveth}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i z&#333;nti andri\)</i></b>. "To the living husband," literally.<br>
 <B>{But if the husband die}</B> <b><i>(\ean de apothan&#275;i ho an&#275;r\)</i></b>. Third<br>
 class condition, a supposable case <b><i>(\ean\ and the second aorist<br>
 active subjunctive)</i></b>. <B>{She is discharged}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;rg&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Perfect<br>
 passive indicative of \katarge&#333;\, to make void. She stands free<br>
 from the law of the husband. Cf. <!-#-->6:6.<br>
 <br>
 7:3 <B>{While the husband liveth}</B> <b><i>(\z&#333;ntos tou andros\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute of present active participle of \za&#333;\. <B>{She shall be<br>
 called}</B> <b><i>(\chr&#275;matisei\)</i></b>. Future active indicative of<br>
 \chr&#275;matiz&#333;\, old verb, to receive a name as in <!-#-->Ac 11:26, from<br>
 \chr&#275;ma\, business, from \chraomai\, to use, then to give an<br>
 oracle, etc. <B>{An adulteress}</B> <b><i>(\moichalis\)</i></b>. Late word, in<br>
 Plutarch, LXX. See on &#175;Mt 12:39. <B>{If she be joined}</B> <b><i>(\ean<br>
 gen&#275;tai\)</i></b>. Third class condition, "if she come to." <B>{So that she<br>
 is no adulteress}</B> <b><i>(\tou m&#275; einai aut&#275;n moichalida\)</i></b>. It is a fact<br>
 that \tou\ and the infinitive is used for result as we saw in<br>
 <!-#-->1:24. Conceived result may explain the idiom here.<br>
 <br>
 7:4 <B>{Ye also were made to the law}</B> <b><i>(\kai humeis ethanat&#333;th&#275;te\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist indicative passive of \thanato&#333;\, old verb, to put<br>
 to death <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 10:21)</i></b> or to make to die <b><i>(extinct)</i></b> as here and <!-#-->Ro<br>
 8:13. The analogy calls for the death of the law, but Paul<br>
 refuses to say that. He changes the structure and makes them dead<br>
 to the law as the husband <b><i>(<!-#-->6:3-6)</i></b>. The relation of marriage is<br>
 killed "through the body of Christ" as the "propitiation"<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->3:25)</i></b> for us. Cf. <!-#-->Col 1:22. <B>{That we should be joined to<br>
 another}</B> <b><i>(\eis to genesthai heter&#333;i\)</i></b>. Purpose clause with \eis<br>
 to\ and the infinitive. First mention of the saints as wedded to<br>
 Christ as their Husband occurs in <!-#-->1Co 6:13; Ga 4:26. See<br>
 further <!-#-->Eph 5:22-33. <B>{That we might bring forth fruit unto God}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hina karpophor&#275;s&#333;men t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>. He changes the metaphor to<br>
 that of the tree used in <!-#-->6:22.<br>
 <br>
 7:5 <B>{In the flesh}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#275;i sarki\)</i></b>. Same sense as in <!-#-->6:19 and<br>
 <!-#-->7:18,25. The "flesh" is not inherently sinful, but is subject<br>
 to sin. It is what Paul means by being "under the law." He uses<br>
 \sarx\ in a good many senses. <B>{Sinful passions}</B> <b><i>(\ta path&#275;mata<br>
 t&#333;n hamarti&#333;n\)</i></b>. "Passions of sins" or marked by sins. <B>{Wrought}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\energeito\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of \energe&#333;\, "were active." <B>{To<br>
 bring forth fruit unto death}</B> <b><i>(\eis to karpophor&#275;sai t&#333;i<br>
 thanat&#333;i\)</i></b>. Purpose clause again. Vivid picture of the seeds of<br>
 sin working for death.<br>
 <br>
 7:6 <B>{But now}</B> <b><i>(\nuni de\)</i></b>. In the new condition. <B>{Wherein we were<br>
 holden}</B> <b><i>(\en h&#333;i kateichometha\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive of \katech&#333;\,<br>
 picture of our former state <b><i>(same verb in <!-#-->1:18)</i></b>. <B>{In newness of<br>
 spirit}</B> <b><i>(\en kainot&#275;ti pneumatos\)</i></b>. The death to the letter of<br>
 the law <b><i>(the old husband)</i></b> has set us free to the new life in<br>
 Christ. So Paul has shown again the obligation on us to live for<br>
 Christ.<br>
 <br>
 7:7 <B>{Is the law sin?}</B> <b><i>(\ho nomos hamartia?\)</i></b>. A pertinent query<br>
 in view of what he had said. Some people today oppose all<br>
 inhibitions and prohibitions because they stimulate violations.<br>
 That is half-baked thinking. <B>{I had not known sin}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n<br>
 hamartian ouk egn&#333;n\)</i></b>. Second aorist indicative of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\, to<br>
 know. It is a conclusion of a second class condition, determined<br>
 as unfulfilled. Usually \an\ is used in the conclusion to make it<br>
 plain that it is second class condition instead of first class,<br>
 but occasionally it is not employed when it is plain enough<br>
 without as here <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 16:22,24)</i></b>. See on &#175;Ga 4:15. So as to <B>{I<br>
 had not known coveting}</B> <b><i>(lust)</i></b>, \epithumian ouk &#275;idein\. But all<br>
 the same the law is not itself sin nor the cause of sin. Men with<br>
 their sinful natures turn law into an occasion for sinful acts.<br>
 <br>
 7:8 <B>{Finding occasion}</B> <b><i>(\aphorm&#275;n labousa\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->2Co 5:12;<br>
 11:12; Ga 5:13 for \aphorm&#275;n\, a starting place from which to<br>
 rush into acts of sin, excuses for doing what they want to do.<br>
 Just so drinking men use the prohibition laws as "occasions" for<br>
 violating them. <B>{Wrought in me}</B> <b><i>(\kateirgasato en emoi\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active middle indicative of the intensive verb<br>
 \katergazomai\, to work out <b><i>(to the finish)</i></b>, effective aorist.<br>
 The command not to lust made me lust more. <B>{Dead}</B> <b><i>(\nekra\)</i></b>.<br>
 Inactive, not non-existent. Sin in reality was there in a dormant<br>
 state.<br>
 <br>
 7:9 <B>{I was alive}</B> <b><i>(\ez&#333;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. Apparently, "the<br>
 lost paradise in the infancy of men" <b><i>(Denney)</i></b>, before the<br>
 conscience awoke and moral responsibility came, "a seeming life"<br>
 <b><i>(Shedd)</i></b>. <B>{Sin revived}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; hamartia anez&#275;sen\)</i></b>. Sin came back to<br>
 life, waked up, the blissful innocent stage was over, "the<br>
 commandment having come" <b><i>(\elthous&#275;s t&#275;s entol&#275;s\, genitive<br>
 absolute)</i></b>. <B>{But I died}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333; de apethanon\)</i></b>. My seeming life was<br>
 over for I was conscious of sin, of violation of law. I was dead<br>
 before, but I did not know. Now I found out that I was<br>
 spiritually dead.<br>
 <br>
 7:10 <B>{This I found unto death}</B> <b><i>(\heureth&#275; moi--haut&#275; eis<br>
 thanaton\)</i></b>. Literally, "the commandment the one for <b><i>(meant for)</i></b><br>
 life, this was found for me unto death." First aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b><br>
 passive indicative of \heurisk&#333;\, to find, not active as the<br>
 English has it. It turned out so for me <b><i>(ethical dative)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:11 <B>{Beguiled me}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#275;pat&#275;sen me\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of \exapata&#333;\, old verb, completely <b><i>(\ex\)</i></b> made me<br>
 lose my way <b><i>(\a\ privative, \pate&#333;\, to walk)</i></b>. See on &#175;1Co 3:18;<br>
 2Co 11:3. Only in Paul in N.T. <B>{Slew me}</B> <b><i>(\apekteinen\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active indicative of \apoktein&#333;\, old verb. "Killed me<br>
 off," made a clean job of it. Sin here is personified as the<br>
 tempter <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 3:13)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:12 <B>{Holy, and righteous, and good}</B> <b><i>(\hagia kai dikaia kai<br>
 agath&#275;\)</i></b>. This is the conclusion <b><i>(wherefore, \h&#333;ste\)</i></b> to the<br>
 query in verse <!-#-->7. The commandment is God's and so holy like<br>
 Him, just in its requirements and designed for our good. The<br>
 modern revolt against law needs these words.<br>
 <br>
 7:13 <B>{Become death unto me?}</B> <b><i>(\emoi egeneto thanatos?\)</i></b>. Ethical<br>
 dative \emoi\ again. New turn to the problem. Admitting the<br>
 goodness of God's law, did it issue in death for me? Paul repels<br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275; genoito\)</i></b> this suggestion. It was sin that <b><i>(But sin, \alla<br>
 h&#275; hamartia\)</i></b> "became death for me." <B>{That it might be shown}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\hina phan&#275;i\)</i></b>. Final clause, \hina\ and second aorist passive<br>
 subjunctive of \phain&#333;\, to show. The sinfulness of sin is<br>
 revealed in its violations of God's law. <B>{By working death to me}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\moi katergazomen&#275; thanaton\)</i></b>. Present middle participle, as an<br>
 incidental result. <B>{Might become exceedingly sinful}</B> <b><i>(\gen&#275;tai<br>
 kath' huperbol&#275;n hamart&#333;los\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle subjunctive<br>
 of \ginomai\ with \hina\ in final clause. On \kath' huperbol&#275;n\,<br>
 see on &#175;1Co 12:31. Our _hyperbole_ is the Greek \huperbol&#275;\. The<br>
 excesses of sin reveal its real nature. Only then do some people<br>
 get their eyes opened.<br>
 <br>
 7:14 <B>{Spiritual}</B> <b><i>(\pneumatikos\)</i></b>. Spirit-caused and spirit-given<br>
 and like the Holy Spirit. See <!-#-->1Co 10:3f. <B>{But I am carnal}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\eg&#333; de sarkinos eimi\)</i></b>. "Fleshen" as in <!-#-->1Co 3:1 which see,<br>
 more emphatic even than \sarkikos\," a creature of flesh." <B>{Sold<br>
 under sin}</B> <b><i>(\pepramenos hupo t&#275;n hamartian\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle of \piprask&#333;\, old verb, to sell. See on &#175;Mt 13:46; Ac<br>
 2:45, state of completion. Sin has closed the mortgage and owns<br>
 its slave.<br>
 <br>
 7:15 <B>{I know not}</B> <b><i>(\ou gin&#333;sk&#333;\)</i></b>. "I do not recognize" in its<br>
 true nature. My spiritual perceptions are dulled, blinded by sin<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 4:4)</i></b>. The dual life pictured here by Paul finds an echo in<br>
 us all, the struggle after the highest in us <b><i>("what I really<br>
 wish," \ho thel&#333;\, to practise it steadily, \prass&#333;\)</i></b> and the<br>
 slipping into doing <b><i>(\poi&#333;\)</i></b> "what I really hate" <b><i>(\ho mis&#333;\)</i></b> and<br>
 yet sometimes do. There is a deal of controversy as to whether<br>
 Paul is describing his struggle with sin before conversion or<br>
 after it. The words "sold under sin" in verse <!-#-->14 seem to turn<br>
 the scale for the pre-conversion period. "It is the unregenerate<br>
 man's experience, surviving at least in memory into regenerate<br>
 days, and read with regenerate eyes" <b><i>(Denney)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:16 <B>{I consent unto the law}</B> <b><i>(\sunph&#275;mi t&#333;i nom&#333;i\)</i></b>. Old verb,<br>
 here only in N.T., with associative instrumental case. "I speak<br>
 with." My wanting <b><i>(\thel&#333;\)</i></b> to do the opposite of what I do<br>
 proves my acceptance of God's law as good <b><i>(\kalos\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:17 <B>{So now}</B> <b><i>(\nuni de\)</i></b>. A logical contrast, "as the case<br>
 really stands." <B>{But sin that dwelleth in me}</B> <b><i>(\all' h&#275; enoikousa<br>
 en emoi hamartia\)</i></b>. "But the dwelling in me sin." Not my true<br>
 self, my higher personality, but my lower self due to my slavery<br>
 to indwelling sin. Paul does not mean to say that his whole self<br>
 has no moral responsibility by using this paradox. "To be saved<br>
 from sin, a man must at the same time own it and disown it"<br>
 <b><i>(Denney)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:18 <B>{In me}</B> <b><i>(\en emoi\)</i></b>. Paul explains this by "in my flesh"<br>
 <b><i>(\en t&#275;i sarki mou\)</i></b>, the unregenerate man "sold under sin" of<br>
 verse <!-#-->14. <B>{No good thing}</B> <b><i>(\ouk--agathon\)</i></b>. "Not absolutely<br>
 good." This is not a complete view of man even in his<br>
 unregenerate state as Paul at once shows. <B>{For to will is present<br>
 with me}</B> <b><i>(\to gar thelein parakeitai moi\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 indicative of \parakeimai\, old verb, to lie beside, at hand,<br>
 with dative \moi\. Only here in N.T. <B>{The wishing}</B> is the better<br>
 self, <B>{the doing not}</B> the lower self.<br>
 <br>
 7:19 <B>{But the evil which I would not}</B> <b><i>(\alla ho ou thel&#333; kakon\)</i></b>.<br>
 Incorporation of the antecedent into the relative clause, "what<br>
 evil I do not wish." An extreme case of this practise of evil is<br>
 seen in the drunkard or the dope-fiend.<br>
 <br>
 7:20 <B>{It is no more I that do it}</B> <b><i>(\ouketi eg&#333; katergazomai<br>
 auto\)</i></b>. Just as in verse <!-#-->17, "no longer do I do it" <b><i>(the real<br>
 \Ego\, my better self)</i></b>, and yet there is responsibility and guilt<br>
 for the struggle goes on.<br>
 <br>
 7:21 <B>{The law}</B> <b><i>(\ton nomon\)</i></b>. The principle already set forth<br>
 <b><i>(\ara\, accordingly)</i></b> in verses <!-#-->18,19. This is the way it works,<br>
 but there is no surcease for the stings of conscience.<br>
 <br>
 7:22 <B>{For I delight in}</B> <b><i>(\sun&#275;domai gar\)</i></b>. Old verb, here alone<br>
 in N.T., with associative instrumental case, "I rejoice with the<br>
 law of God," my real self "after the inward man" <b><i>(\kata ton es&#333;<br>
 anthr&#333;pon\)</i></b> of the conscience as opposed to "the outward man"<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 4:16; Eph 3:16)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 7:23 <B>{A different law}</B> <b><i>(\heteron nomon\)</i></b>. For the distinction<br>
 between \heteros\ and \allos\, see <!-#-->Ga 1:6f. <B>{Warring against}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\antistrateuomenon\)</i></b>. Rare verb <b><i>(_Xenophon_)</i></b> to carry on a<br>
 campaign against. Only here in N.T. <B>{The law of my mind}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i<br>
 nom&#333;i tou noos\)</i></b>. The reflective intelligence Paul means by<br>
 \noos\, "the inward man" of verse <!-#-->22. It is this higher self<br>
 that agrees that the law of God is good <b><i>(<!-#-->12,16,22)</i></b>. <B>{Bringing<br>
 me into captivity}</B> <b><i>(\aichmal&#333;tizonta\)</i></b>. See on this late and<br>
 vivid verb for capture and slavery <!-#-->Lu 21:24; 2Co 10:5. Surely<br>
 it is a tragic picture drawn by Paul with this outcome, "sold<br>
 under sin" <b><i>(<!-#-->14)</i></b>, "captivity to the law of sin" <b><i>(<!-#-->23)</i></b>. The<br>
 ancient writers <b><i>(Plato, Ovid, Seneca, Epictetus)</i></b> describe the<br>
 same dual struggle in man between his conscience and his deeds.<br>
 <br>
 7:24 <B>{O wretched man that I am}</B> <b><i>(\talaip&#333;ros eg&#333; anthr&#333;pos\)</i></b>.<br>
 "Wretched man I." Old adjective from \tla&#333;\, to bear, and<br>
 \p&#333;ros\, a callus. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->Re 3:17. "A<br>
 heart-rending cry from the depths of despair" <b><i>(Sanday and<br>
 Headlam)</i></b>. <B>{Out of the body of this death}</B> <b><i>(\ek tou s&#333;matos tou<br>
 thanatou toutou\)</i></b>. So the order of words demands. See verse <!-#-->13<br>
 for "death" which finds a lodgment in the body <b><i>(Lightfoot)</i></b>. If<br>
 one feels that Paul has exaggerated his own condition, he has<br>
 only to recall <!-#-->1Ti 1:15 when he describes himself a chief of<br>
 sinners. He dealt too honestly with himself for Pharisaic<br>
 complacency to live long.<br>
 <br>
 7:25 <B>{I thank God}</B> <b><i>(\charis t&#333;i the&#333;i\)</i></b>. "Thanks to God." Note of<br>
 victory over death through Jesus Christ our Lord." <B>{So then I<br>
 myself}</B> <b><i>(\ara oun autos eg&#333;\)</i></b>. His whole self in his unregenerate<br>
 state gives a divided service as he has already shown above. In<br>
 <!-#-->6:1-7:6 Paul proved the obligation to be sanctified. In<br>
 <!-#-->7:7-8:11 he discusses the possibility of sanctification, only<br>
 for the renewed man by the help of the Holy Spirit.<br>
