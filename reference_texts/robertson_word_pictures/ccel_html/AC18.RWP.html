<p>18:1 <B>{To Corinth}</B> <b><i>(\eis Korinthon\)</i></b>. Mummius had captured and<br>
 destroyed Corinth B.C. 146. It was restored by Julius Caesar B.C.<br>
 46 as a boom town and made a colony. It was now the capital of<br>
 the province of Achaia and the chief commercial city of Greece<br>
 with a cosmopolitan population. It was only fifty miles from<br>
 Athens. The summit of Acrocorinthus was 1,800 feet high and the<br>
 ports of Cenchreae and Lechaeum and the Isthmus across which<br>
 ships were hauled gave it command of the trade routes between<br>
 Asia and Rome. The temple of Aphrodite on the Acrocorinthus had a<br>
 thousand consecrated prostitutes and the very name to<br>
 Corinthianize meant immorality. Not the Parthenon with Athene<br>
 faced Paul in Corinth, but a worse situation. Naturally many Jews<br>
 were in such a mart of trade. Philippi, Thessalonica, Beroea,<br>
 Athens, all had brought anxiety to Paul. What could he expect in<br>
 licentious Corinth?<br>
 <br>
 18:2 <B>{Aquila}</B> <b><i>(\Akulan\)</i></b>. Luke calls him a Jew from Pontus,<br>
 apparently not yet a disciple, though there were Jews from Pontus<br>
 at the great Pentecost who were converted <b><i>(<!-#-->2:9)</i></b>. Aquila who<br>
 made the famous A.D. translation of the O.T. was also from<br>
 Pontus. Paul "found" <b><i>(\heur&#333;n\, second aorist active participle<br>
 of \heurisk&#333;\)</i></b> though we do not know how. Edersheim says that a<br>
 Jewish guild always kept together whether in street or synagogue<br>
 so that by this bond they probably met. <B>{Lately come from Italy}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\prosphat&#333;s el&#275;luthota apo t&#275;s Italias\)</i></b>. Second perfect<br>
 participle of \erchomai\. _Koin&#275;_ adverb, here only in the N.T.,<br>
 from adjective \prosphatos\ <b><i>(\pro, spha&#333;\ or \sphaz&#333;\, to kill)</i></b>,<br>
 lately slaughtered and so fresh or recent <b><i>(<!-#-->Heb 10:20)</i></b>. <B>{With<br>
 his wife Priscilla}</B> <b><i>(\kai Priskillan gunaika autou\)</i></b>. Diminutive<br>
 of \Priska\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 16:3; 1Co 16:19)</i></b>. Prisca is a name in the<br>
 Acilian family and the Prisci was the name of another noble clan.<br>
 Aquila may have been a freedman like many Jews in Rome. Her name<br>
 comes before his in verses <!-#-->18,26; Ro 16:3; 2Ti 4:9. <B>{Because<br>
 Claudius had commanded}</B> <b><i>(\dia to diatetachenai Klaudion\)</i></b>.<br>
 Perfect active articular infinitive of \diatass&#333;\, old verb to<br>
 dispose, arrange, here with accusative of general reference.<br>
 \Dia\ here is causal sense, "because of the having ordered as to<br>
 Claudius." This was about A.D. 49, done, Suetonius says<br>
 <b><i>(_Claudius_ C. 25)</i></b>, because "the Jews were in a state of constant<br>
 tumult at the instigation of one Chrestus" <b><i>(probably among the<br>
 Jews about Christ so pronounced)</i></b>. At any rate Jews were unpopular<br>
 in Rome for Tiberius had deported 4,000 to Sardinia. There were<br>
 20,000 Jews in Rome. Probably mainly those implicated in the<br>
 riots actually left.<br>
 <br>
 18:3 <B>{Because he was of the same trade}</B> <b><i>(\dia to homotechnon<br>
 einai\)</i></b>. Same construction with \dia\ as above. \Homotechnon\ is<br>
 an old word <b><i>(\homos, techn&#275;\)</i></b>, though here alone in N.T. Rabbi<br>
 Judah says: "He that teacheth not his son a trade, doth the same<br>
 as if he taught him to be a thief." So it was easy for Paul to<br>
 find a home with these "tentmakers by trade" <b><i>(\sk&#275;noipoioi t&#275;i<br>
 techn&#275;i\)</i></b>. Late word from \sk&#275;n&#275;\ and \poie&#333;\, here only in the<br>
 N.T. They made portable tents of leather or of cloth of goat's<br>
 hair. So Paul lived in this home with this noble man and his<br>
 wife, all the more congenial if already Christians which they<br>
 soon became at any rate. They worked as partners in the common<br>
 trade. Paul worked for his support elsewhere, already in<br>
 Thessalonica <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 2:9; 2Th 3:8)</i></b> and later at Ephesus with<br>
 Aquila and Priscilla <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:18,26; 20:34; 1Co 16:19)</i></b>. They<br>
 moved again to Rome <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 16:3)</i></b> and were evidently a couple of<br>
 considerable wealth and generosity. It was a blessing to Paul to<br>
 find himself with these people. So he "abode" <b><i>(\emenen\,<br>
 imperfect active)</i></b> with them and "they wrought" <b><i>(\&#275;rgazonto\,<br>
 imperfect middle)</i></b>, happy and busy during week days.<br>
 <br>
 18:4 <B>{He reasoned}</B> <b><i>(\dielegeto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle, same form as<br>
 in <!-#-->17:17 about Paul's work in Athens, here only on the<br>
 Sabbaths. <B>{Persuaded}</B> <b><i>(\epeithen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, conative,<br>
 he tried to persuade both Jews and Greeks <b><i>(God-fearers who alone<br>
 would come)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:5 <B>{Was constrained by the word}</B> <b><i>(\suneicheto t&#333;i log&#333;i\)</i></b>. This<br>
 is undoubtedly the correct text and not \t&#333;i pneumati\ of the<br>
 Textus Receptus, but \suneicheto\ is in my opinion the direct<br>
 middle imperfect indicative, not the imperfect passive as the<br>
 translations have it <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 808)</i></b>. Paul held<br>
 himself together or completely to the preaching instead of just<br>
 on Sabbaths in the synagogue <b><i>(verse <!-#-->4)</i></b>. The coming of Silas and<br>
 Timothy with the gifts from Macedonia <b><i>(<!-#-->1Th 3:6; 2Co 11:9; Php<br>
 4:15)</i></b> set Paul free from tent-making for a while so that he<br>
 began to devote himself <b><i>(inchoative imperfect)</i></b> with fresh<br>
 consecration to preaching. See the active in <!-#-->2Co 5:14. He was<br>
 now also assisted by Silas and Timothy <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 1:19)</i></b>. <B>{Testifying<br>
 to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ}</B> <b><i>(\diamarturomenos tois<br>
 Ioudaiois einai ton Christon I&#275;soun\)</i></b>. Paul's witness everywhere<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->9:22; 17:3)</i></b>. This verb \diamarturomenos\ occurs in <!-#-->2:40<br>
 <b><i>(which see)</i></b> for Peter's earnest witness. Perhaps daily now in the<br>
 synagogue he spoke to the Jews who came. \Einai\ is the<br>
 infinitive in indirect discourse <b><i>(assertion)</i></b> with the accusative<br>
 of general reference. By \ton Christon\ Paul means "the Messiah."<br>
 His witness is to show to the Jews that Jesus of Nazareth is the<br>
 Messiah.<br>
 <br>
 18:6 <B>{When they opposed themselves}</B> <b><i>(\antitassomen&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute with present middle <b><i>(direct middle again)</i></b> of<br>
 \antitass&#333;\, old verb to range in battle array <b><i>(\tass&#333;\)</i></b> face to<br>
 face with or against <b><i>(\anti\)</i></b>. In the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Ro<br>
 13:2; Jas 4:6; 1Pe 5:5. Paul's fresh activity roused the rabbis<br>
 as at Antioch in Pisidia and at Thessalonica in concerted<br>
 opposition and railing <b><i>(blasphemy)</i></b>. <B>{He shook out his raiment}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ektinaxamenos ta himatia\)</i></b>. First aorist middle of \ektinass&#333;\,<br>
 old verb, in the N.T. only here as in <!-#-->13:51 <b><i>(middle)</i></b> and <!-#-->Mr<br>
 6:11; Mt 10:15 where active voice occurs of shaking out dust<br>
 also. Vivid and dramatic picture here like that in <!-#-->Ne 5:13,<br>
 "undoubtedly a very exasperating gesture" <b><i>(Ramsay)</i></b>, but Paul was<br>
 deeply stirred. <B>{Your blood be upon your own heads}</B> <b><i>(\To haima<br>
 hum&#333;n epi t&#275;n kephal&#275;n hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->Eze 3:18f., 33:4,8f.; 2Sa<br>
 1:16. Not as a curse, but "a solemn disclaimer of<br>
 responsibility" by Paul <b><i>(Page)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Ac 20:26. The Jews used<br>
 this very phrase in assuming responsibility for the blood of<br>
 Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 27:25)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Mt 23:35. <B>{I am clean}</B> <b><i>(\katharos<br>
 eg&#333;\)</i></b>. Pure from your blood. Repeats the claim made in previous<br>
 sentence. Paul had done his duty. <B>{From henceforth}</B> <b><i>(\apo tou<br>
 nun\)</i></b>. Turning point reached in Corinth. He will devote himself<br>
 to the Gentiles, though Jews will be converted there also.<br>
 Elsewhere as in Ephesus <b><i>(<!-#-->19:1-10)</i></b> and in Rome <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 28:23-28)</i></b><br>
 Paul will preach also to Jews.<br>
 <br>
 18:7 <B>{Titus Justus}</B> <b><i>(\Titou Ioustou\)</i></b>. So Aleph E Vulgate, while<br>
 B has \Titiau Ioustou\, while most MSS. have only \Ioustou\.<br>
 Evidently a Roman citizen and not Titus, brother of Luke, of <!-#-->Ga<br>
 2:1. We had Barsabbas Justus <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 1:23)</i></b> and Paul speaks of<br>
 Jesus Justus <b><i>(<!-#-->Co 4:11)</i></b>. The Titii were a famous family of<br>
 potters in Corinth. This Roman was a God-fearer whose house<br>
 "joined hard to the synagogue" <b><i>(\&#275;n sunomorousa t&#275;i sunag&#333;g&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic imperfect active of \sunomore&#333;\, a late <b><i>(Byzantine)</i></b><br>
 word, here only in the N.T., followed by the associative<br>
 instrumental case, from \sunomoros\ <b><i>(\sun\, \homoros\ from<br>
 \homos\, joint, and \horos\, boundary)</i></b> having joint boundaries,<br>
 right next to. Whether Paul chose this location for his work<br>
 because it was next to the synagogue, we do not know, but it<br>
 caught the attendants at the synagogue worship. In Ephesus when<br>
 Paul had to leave the synagogue he went to the school house of<br>
 Tyrannus <b><i>(<!-#-->19:9f.)</i></b>. The lines are being drawn between the<br>
 Christians and the Jews, drawn by the Jews themselves.<br>
 <br>
 18:8 <B>{Crispus}</B> <b><i>(\Krispos\)</i></b>. Though a Jew and ruler of the<br>
 synagogue <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->13:15)</i></b>, he had a Latin name. Paul baptized him<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 1:14)</i></b> himself, perhaps because of his prominence,<br>
 apparently letting Silas and Timothy baptize most of the converts<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 1:14-17)</i></b>. Probably he followed Paul to the house of Titus<br>
 Justus. It looked like ruin for the synagogue. <B>{With all his<br>
 house}</B> <b><i>(\sun hol&#333;i t&#333;i oik&#333;i autou\)</i></b>. Another household<br>
 conversion, for Crispus "believed <b><i>(\episteusen\)</i></b> in the Lord with<br>
 all his house." <B>{Hearing believed and were baptized}</B> <b><i>(\akouontes<br>
 episteuon kai ebaptizonto\)</i></b>. Present active participle and<br>
 imperfect indicatives active and passive, expressing repetition<br>
 for the "many" others who kept coming to the Lord in Corinth. It<br>
 was a continual revival after Silas and Timothy came and a great<br>
 church was gathered here during the nearly two years that Paul<br>
 laboured in Corinth <b><i>(possibly A.D. 51 and 52)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:9 <B>{Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace}</B> <b><i>(\M&#275;<br>
 phobou, alla lalei kai m&#275; si&#333;p&#275;s&#275;is\)</i></b>. Literally, "stop being<br>
 afraid <b><i>(\m&#275;\ with present middle imperative of \phobe&#333;\)</i></b>, but go<br>
 on speaking <b><i>(present active imperative of \lale&#333;\)</i></b> and do not<br>
 become silent <b><i>(\m&#275;\ and first aorist active of \si&#333;pa&#333;\,<br>
 ingressive aorist)</i></b>." Evidently there were signs of a gathering<br>
 storm before this vision and message from the Lord Jesus came to<br>
 Paul one night. Paul knew only too well what Jewish hatred could<br>
 do as he had learned it at Damascus, Jerusalem, Antioch in<br>
 Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe, Thessalonica, Beroea. He had<br>
 clearly moments of doubt whether he had not better move on or<br>
 become silent for a while in Corinth. Every pastor knows what it<br>
 is to have such moods and moments. In <!-#-->2Th 3:2 <b><i>(written at this<br>
 time)</i></b> we catch Paul's dejection of spirits. He was like Elijah<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Ki 19:4)</i></b> and Jeremiah <b><i>(<!-#-->Jer 15:15ff.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:10 <B>{Because I am with thee}</B> <b><i>(\dioti eg&#333; eimi meta sou\)</i></b>. Jesus<br>
 had given this promise to all believers <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 28:20)</i></b> and here he<br>
 renews it to Paul. This promise changes Paul's whole outlook.<br>
 Jesus had spoken to Paul before, on the way to Damascus <b><i>(<!-#-->9:4)</i></b>,<br>
 in Jerusalem <b><i>(<!-#-->22:17f.)</i></b>, in Troas <b><i>(<!-#-->16:9)</i></b>, in great crises of<br>
 his life. He will hear him again <b><i>(<!-#-->23:11; 27:23)</i></b>. Paul knows the<br>
 voice of Jesus. <B>{No man shall set on thee to harm thee}</B> <b><i>(\oudeis<br>
 epith&#275;setai soi tou kak&#333;sai se\)</i></b>. Future direct middle indicative<br>
 of \epitith&#275;mi\, old and common verb, here in direct middle to<br>
 lay or throw oneself upon, to attack. Jesus kept that promise in<br>
 Corinth for Paul. \Tou kak&#333;sai\ is genitive articular infinitive<br>
 of purpose of \kako&#333;\, to do harm to. Paul would now face all the<br>
 rabbis without fear. <B>{I have much people}</B> <b><i>(\laos estin moi<br>
 polus\)</i></b>. Dative of personal interest. "There is to me much<br>
 people," not yet saved, but who will be if Paul holds on. There<br>
 is the problem for every preacher and pastor, how to win the<br>
 elect to Christ.<br>
 <br>
 18:11 <B>{A year and six months}</B> <b><i>(\eniauton kai m&#275;nas hex\)</i></b>.<br>
 Accusative of extent of time. How much time before this incident<br>
 he had been there we do not know. He was in Corinth probably a<br>
 couple of years in all. His work extended beyond the city <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co<br>
 11:10)</i></b> and there was a church in Cenchreae <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 16:1)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 18:12 <B>{When Gallio was proconsul of Achaia}</B> <b><i>(\Galli&#333;nos de<br>
 anthupatou ontos t&#275;s Achaias\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute of present<br>
 participle \ontos\. Brother of Seneca the Stoic <b><i>(Nero's tutor)</i></b><br>
 and uncle of Lucan the author of the \Pharsalia\. His original<br>
 name was M. Annaeus Novatus till he was adopted by Gallio the<br>
 rhetorician. The family was Spanish. Gallio was a man of culture<br>
 and refinement and may have been chosen proconsul of Achaia for<br>
 this reason. Statius calls him "_dulcis Gallio_." Seneca says of<br>
 him: _Nemo enim mortalium uni tam dulcis quam hic omnibus_ <b><i>(No<br>
 one of mortals is so pleasant to one person as he is to all)</i></b>.<br>
 Luke alone among writers says that he was proconsul, but Seneca<br>
 speaks of his being in Achaia where he caught fever, a<br>
 corroboration of Luke. But now a whitish grey limestone<br>
 inscription from the Hagios Elias quarries near Delphi <b><i>(a letter<br>
 of Claudius to Delphi)</i></b> has been found which definitely names<br>
 Gallio as proconsul of Achaia <b><i>(\authupatos t&#275;s Achaias\)</i></b>. The<br>
 province of Achaia after various shifts <b><i>(first senatorial, then<br>
 imperial)</i></b> back and forth with Macedonia, in A.D. 44 Claudius gave<br>
 back to the Senate with proconsul as the title of the governor.<br>
 It is amazing how Luke is confirmed whenever a new discovery is<br>
 made. The discovery of this inscription has thrown light also on<br>
 the date of Paul's work in Corinth as it says that Gallio came in<br>
 the 26th acclamation of Claudius as Emperor in A.D. 51, that<br>
 would definitely fix the time of Paul in Corinth as A.D. 50 and<br>
 51 <b><i>(or 51 and 52)</i></b>. Deissmann has a full and able discussion of<br>
 the whole matter in Appendix I to his _St. Paul_. <B>{Rose up}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\katepest&#275;san\)</i></b>. Second aorist active of \kat-eph-ist&#275;mi\,<br>
 intransitive, to take a stand against, a double compound verb<br>
 found nowhere else. They took a stand <b><i>(\est&#275;san\)</i></b> against<br>
 <b><i>(\kata\, down on, \epi\, upon)</i></b>, they made a dash or rush at Paul<br>
 as if they would stand it no longer. <B>{Before the judgment seat}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\epi to b&#275;ma\)</i></b>. See on &#175;12:21. The proconsul was sitting in the<br>
 basilica in the forum or agora. The Jews had probably heard of<br>
 his reputation for moderation and sought to make an impression as<br>
 they had on the praetors of Philippi by their rush <b><i>(\sunepest&#275;\,<br>
 <!-#-->16:22)</i></b>. The new proconsul was a good chance also <b><i>(<!-#-->25:2)</i></b>. So<br>
 for the second time Paul faces a Roman proconsul <b><i>(Sergius Paulus,<br>
 <!-#-->13:7)</i></b> though under very different circumstances.<br>
 <br>
 18:13 <B>{Contrary to the law}</B> <b><i>(\para ton nomon\)</i></b>. They did not<br>
 accuse Paul of treason as in Thessalonica, perhaps Paul had been<br>
 more careful in his language here. They bring the same charge<br>
 here that the owners of the slave-girl brought in Philippi<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->16:21)</i></b> Perhaps they fear to go too far with Gallio, for they<br>
 are dealing with a Roman proconsul, not with the politarchs of<br>
 Thessalonica. The Jewish religion was a _religio licita_ and they<br>
 were allowed to make proselytes, but not among Roman citizens. To<br>
 prove that Paul was acting contrary to Roman law <b><i>(for Jewish law<br>
 had no standing with Gallio though the phrase has a double<br>
 meaning)</i></b> these Jews had to show that Paul was making converts in<br>
 ways that violated the Roman regulations on that subject. The<br>
 accusation as made did not show it nor did they produce any<br>
 evidence to do it. The verb used \anapeithei\ means to stir up by<br>
 persuasion <b><i>(old verb here only in the N.T.)</i></b>, a thing that he had<br>
 a right to do.<br>
 <br>
 18:14 <B>{When Paul was about to open his mouth}</B> <b><i>(\mellontos tou<br>
 Paulou anoigein to stoma\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again. Before Paul<br>
 could speak, Gallio cut in and ended the whole matter. According<br>
 to their own statement Paul needed no defence. <B>{Wrong}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\adik&#275;ma\)</i></b>. _Injuria_. Old word, a wrong done one. In N.T. only<br>
 here, <!-#-->Ac 24:20; Re 18:5. Here it may mean a legal wrong to the<br>
 state. <B>{Wicked villainy}</B> <b><i>(\rh&#257;idiourg&#275;ma\)</i></b>. A crime, act of a<br>
 criminal, from \rh&#257;idiourgos\ <b><i>(\rh&#257;idios\, easy, \ergon\, work)</i></b>,<br>
 one who does a thing with ease, adroitly, a "slick citizen."<br>
 <B>{Reason would that I should bear with you}</B> <b><i>(\kata logon an<br>
 aneschom&#275;n hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. Literally, "according to reason I should have<br>
 put up with you <b><i>(or held myself back from you)</i></b>." This condition<br>
 is the second class <b><i>(determined as unfulfilled)</i></b> and means that<br>
 the Jews had no case against Paul in a Roman court. The verb in<br>
 the conclusion <b><i>(\aneschom&#275;n\)</i></b> is second aorist middle indicative<br>
 and means with the ablative \hum&#333;n\ "I should have held myself<br>
 back <b><i>(direct middle)</i></b> from you <b><i>(ablative)</i></b>. The use of \an\ makes<br>
 the form of the condition plain.<br>
 <br>
 18:15 <B>{Questions}</B> <b><i>(\z&#275;t&#275;mata\)</i></b>. Plural, contemptuous, "a parcel<br>
 of questions" <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. <B>{About words}</B> <b><i>(\peri logou\)</i></b>. Word,<br>
 singular, talk, not deed or fact <b><i>(\ergon, factum\)</i></b>. <B>{And names}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kai onomat&#333;n\)</i></b>. As to whether "Jesus" should also be called<br>
 "Christ" or "Messiah." The Jews, Gallio knew, split hairs over<br>
 words and names. <B>{And your own law}</B> <b><i>(\kai nomou tou kath' hum&#257;s\)</i></b><br>
 Literally, "And law that according to you." Gallio had not been<br>
 caught in the trap set for him. What they had said concerned<br>
 Jewish law, not Roman law at all. <B>{Look to it yourselves}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\opsesthe autoi\)</i></b>. The volitive future middle indicative of<br>
 \hora&#333;\ often used <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Mt 27:4)</i></b> where an imperative could be<br>
 employed <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 874)</i></b>. The use of \autoi\<br>
 <b><i>(yourselves)</i></b> turns it all over to them. <B>{I am not minded}</B> <b><i>(\ou<br>
 boulomai\)</i></b>. I am not willing, I do not wish. An absolute refusal<br>
 to allow a religious question to be brought before a Roman civil<br>
 court. This decision of Gallio does not establish Christianity in<br>
 preference to Judaism. It simply means that the case was plainly<br>
 that Christianity was a form of Judaism and as such was not<br>
 opposed to Roman law. This decision opened the door for Paul's<br>
 preaching all over the Roman Empire. Later Paul himself argues<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 9-11)</i></b> that in fact Christianity is the true, the spiritual<br>
 Judaism.<br>
 <br>
 18:16 <B>{He drave them}</B> <b><i>(\ap&#275;lasen autous\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of \apelaun&#333;\, old word, but here alone in the N.T.<br>
 The Jews were stunned by this sudden blow from the mild proconsul<br>
 and wanted to linger to argue the case further, but they had to<br>
 go.<br>
 <br>
 18:17 <B>{They all laid hold on Sosthenes}</B> <b><i>(\epilabomenoi pantes<br>
 S&#333;sthen&#275;n\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->16:19; 17:19 for the same form. Here is<br>
 violent hostile reaction against their leader who had failed so<br>
 miserably. <B>{Beat him}</B> <b><i>(\etupton\)</i></b>. Inchoative imperfect active,<br>
 began to beat him, even if they could not beat Paul. Sosthenes<br>
 succeeded Crispus <b><i>(verse <!-#-->8)</i></b> when he went over to Paul. The<br>
 beating did Sosthenes good for he too finally is a Christian<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 1:1)</i></b>, a co-worker with Paul whom he had sought to<br>
 persecute. <B>{And Gallio cared for none of these things}</B> <b><i>(\kai<br>
 ouden tout&#333;n t&#333;i Galli&#333;ni emelen\)</i></b>. Literally, "no one of these<br>
 things was a care to Gallio." The usually impersonal verb<br>
 <b><i>(\melei, emelen\, imperfect active)</i></b> here has the nominative as in<br>
 <!-#-->Lu 10:40. These words have been often misunderstood as a<br>
 description of Gallio's lack of interest in Christianity, a<br>
 religious indifferentist. But that is quite beside the mark.<br>
 Gallio looked the other way with a blind eye while Sosthenes got<br>
 the beating which he richly deserved. That was a small detail for<br>
 the police court, not for the proconsul's concern. Gallio shows<br>
 up well in Luke's narrative as a clear headed judge who would not<br>
 be led astray by Jewish subterfuges and with the courage to<br>
 dismiss a mob.<br>
 <br>
 18:18 <B>{Having tarried after this yet many days}</B> <b><i>(\eti prosmeinas<br>
 h&#275;meras hikanas\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(constative)</i></b> active participle of<br>
 \prosmen&#333;\, old verb, to remain besides <b><i>(\pros\ as in <!-#-->1Ti 1:3)</i></b><br>
 and that idea is expressed also in \eti\ <b><i>(yet)</i></b>. The accusative is<br>
 extent of time. On Luke's frequent use of \hikanos\ see <!-#-->8:11.<br>
 It is not certain that this period of "considerable days" which<br>
 followed the trial before Gallio is included in the year and six<br>
 months of verse <!-#-->11 or is in addition to it which is most<br>
 likely. Vindicated as Paul was, there was no reason for haste in<br>
 leaving, though he usually left after such a crisis was passed.<br>
 <B>{Took his leave}</B> <b><i>(\apotaxamenos\)</i></b>. First aorist middle <b><i>(direct)</i></b>,<br>
 old verb, to separate oneself, to bid farewell <b><i>(Vulgate<br>
 _valefacio_)</i></b>, as in verse <!-#-->21; Mr 6:46. <B>{Sailed thence}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\exeplei\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of \ekple&#333;\, old and common verb,<br>
 inchoative imperfect, started to sail. Only Priscilla and Aquila<br>
 are mentioned as his companions though others may have been in<br>
 the party. <B>{Having shorn his head}</B> <b><i>(\keiramenos t&#275;n kephal&#275;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist middle <b><i>(causative)</i></b> of \keir&#333;\, old verb to shear<br>
 <b><i>(sheep)</i></b> and the hair as also in <!-#-->1Co 11:6. The participle is<br>
 masculine and so cannot refer to Priscilla. Aquila comes next to<br>
 the participle, but since mention of Priscilla and Aquila is<br>
 parenthetical and the two other participles <b><i>(\prosmeinas,<br>
 apotaxamenos\)</i></b> refer to Paul it seems clear that this one does<br>
 also. <B>{For he had a vow}</B> <b><i>(\eichen gar euch&#275;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect active<br>
 showing the continuance of the vow up till this time in<br>
 Cenchreae, the port of Corinth when it expired. It was not a<br>
 Nazarite vow which could be absolved only in Jerusalem. It is<br>
 possible that the hair was only polled or trimmed, cut shorter,<br>
 not "shaved" <b><i>(\xura&#333;\ as in <!-#-->21:24)</i></b> for there is a distinction<br>
 as both verbs are contrasted in <!-#-->1Co 11:6 <b><i>(\keir&#257;sthai &#275;<br>
 xur&#257;sthai\)</i></b>. It is not clear what sort of a vow Paul had taken<br>
 nor why he took it. It may have been a thank offering for the<br>
 outcome at Corinth <b><i>(Hackett)</i></b>. Paul as a Jew kept up his<br>
 observance of the ceremonial law, but refused to impose it on the<br>
 Gentiles.<br>
 <br>
 18:19 <B>{Came}</B> <b><i>(\kat&#275;nt&#275;san\)</i></b>. Came down, as usual in speaking of<br>
 coming to land <b><i>(<!-#-->16:1)</i></b>. <B>{To Ephesus}</B> <b><i>(\eis Epheson\)</i></b>. This great<br>
 city on the Cayster, the capital of the Province of Asia, the<br>
 home of the worship of Diana <b><i>(Artemis)</i></b> with a wonderful temple,<br>
 Paul at last had reached, though forbidden to come on the way out<br>
 on this tour <b><i>(<!-#-->16:6)</i></b>. Here Paul will spend three years after his<br>
 return from Jerusalem. <B>{He left them there}</B> <b><i>(\kakeinous katelipen<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. That is, Priscilla and Aquila he left <b><i>(second aorist<br>
 active indicative)</i></b> here <b><i>(\autou\)</i></b>. But Luke mentions the<br>
 departure by way of anticipation before he actually went away<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->21)</i></b>. <B>{But he himself}</B> <b><i>(\autos de\)</i></b>. Paul again the<br>
 leading person in the narrative. On this occasion he may have<br>
 gone alone into the synagogue. <B>{He reasoned}</B> <b><i>(\dielexato\)</i></b>.<br>
 Luke's favourite word for Paul's synagogue discourses <b><i>(<!-#-->17:2,17;<br>
 18:4 which see)</i></b> as also <!-#-->19:8,9.<br>
 <br>
 18:20 <B>{When they asked him}</B> <b><i>(\er&#333;t&#333;nt&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute of present participle of \er&#333;ta&#333;\, old verb to ask a<br>
 question, common in _Koin&#275;_ to make a request as here. <B>{He<br>
 consented not}</B> <b><i>(\ouk epeneusen\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative<br>
 of \epineu&#333;\, old verb to express approval by a nod, only here in<br>
 the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 18:21 <B>{I shall return}</B> <b><i>(\anakamps&#333;\)</i></b>. Future active indicative of<br>
 \anakampt&#333;\, old verb to bend back, turn back <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 2:2)</i></b>. <B>{If God<br>
 will}</B> <b><i>(\tou theou thelontos\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute of present<br>
 active participle. This expression <b><i>(\ean\ with subjunctive)</i></b><br>
 occurs also in <!-#-->1Co 4:19; 16:7; Jas 4:15. Such phrases were<br>
 common among Jews, Greeks, and Romans, and are today. It is<br>
 simply a recognition that we are in God's hands. The Textus<br>
 Receptus has here a sentence not in the best MSS.: "I must by all<br>
 means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem." This addition by<br>
 D and other documents may have been due to a desire to give a<br>
 reason for the language in verse <!-#-->22 about "going up" to<br>
 Jerusalem. Whether Paul said it or not, it was in the spring when<br>
 he made this journey with a company of pilgrims probably going to<br>
 the feast of Pentecost in Jerusalem. We know that later Paul did<br>
 try to reach Jerusalem for Pentecost <b><i>(<!-#-->20:16)</i></b> and succeeded. As<br>
 the ship was leaving, Paul had to go, but with the hope of<br>
 returning soon to Ephesus as he did.<br>
 <br>
 18:22 <B>{He went up and saluted the church}</B> <b><i>(\anabas kai<br>
 aspasamenos t&#275;n ekkl&#275;sian\)</i></b>. The language could refer to the<br>
 church in Caesarea where Paul had just landed, except for several<br>
 things. The going up <b><i>(\anabas\, second aorist active participle<br>
 of \anabain&#333;\)</i></b> is the common way of speaking of going to<br>
 Jerusalem which was up from every direction save from Hebron. It<br>
 was the capital of Palestine as people in England today speaking<br>
 of going up to London. Besides "he went down to Antioch" <b><i>(\kateb&#275;<br>
 eis Antiocheian\, second aorist active indicative of \katabain&#333;\)</i></b><br>
 which language suits better leaving Jerusalem than Caesarea.<br>
 Moreover, there was no special reason for this trip to Caesarea,<br>
 but to Jerusalem it was different. Here Paul saluted the church<br>
 in the fourth of his five visits after his conversion <b><i>(<!-#-->9:26;<br>
 11:30; 15:4; 18:22; 21:17)</i></b>. The apostles may or may not have<br>
 been in the city, but Paul had friends in Jerusalem now.<br>
 Apparently he did not tarry long, but returned to Antioch to make<br>
 a report of his second mission tour as he had done at the close<br>
 of the first when he and Barnabas came back <b><i>(<!-#-->14:26-28)</i></b>. He had<br>
 started on this tour with Silas and had picked up Timothy and<br>
 Luke, but came back alone. He had a great story to tell.<br>
 <br>
 18:23 <B>{Having spent some time}</B> <b><i>(\poi&#275;sas chronon tina\)</i></b>.<br>
 Literally, having done some time. How long we do not know,<br>
 probably not long. There are those who place the visit of Peter<br>
 here to which Paul alludes in <!-#-->Ga 2:11ff. and which we have<br>
 located while Paul was here the last time <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 15:35)</i></b>. <B>{He<br>
 departed}</B> <b><i>(\ex&#275;lthen\)</i></b>. Thus simply and alone Paul began the<br>
 third mission tour without a Barnabas or a Silas. <B>{Went through}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dierchomenos\)</i></b>. Present middle participle, going through. <B>{The<br>
 region of Galatia and Phrygia}</B> <b><i>(\ten Galatik&#275;n ch&#333;ran kai<br>
 Phrygian\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Ac 16:6 for discussion of this phrase, here<br>
 in reverse order, passing through the Galatic region and then<br>
 Phrygia. Does Luke mean Lycaonia <b><i>(Derbe and Lystra)</i></b> and Phrygia<br>
 <b><i>(Iconium and Pisidian Antioch)</i></b>? Or does he mean the route west<br>
 through the old Galatia and the old Phrygia on west into Asia?<br>
 The same conflict exists here over the South Galatian and the<br>
 North Galatian theories. Phrygia is apparently distinguished from<br>
 the Galatic region here. It is apparently A.D. 52 when Paul set<br>
 out on this tour. <B>{In order}</B> <b><i>(\kathex&#275;s\)</i></b>. In succession as in<br>
 <!-#-->11:4, though the names of the cities are not given.<br>
 <B>{Stablishing}</B> <b><i>(\st&#275;riz&#333;n\)</i></b>. As he did in the second tour<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->15:41, \epist&#275;riz&#333;n\, compound of this same verb)</i></b> which see.<br>
 <br>
 18:24 <B>{Apollos}</B> <b><i>(\Apoll&#333;s\)</i></b>. Genitive \-&#333;\ Attic second<br>
 declension. Probably a contraction of \Apollonios\ as D has it<br>
 here. <B>{An Alexandrian}</B> <b><i>(\Alexandreus\)</i></b>. Alexander the Great<br>
 founded this city B.C. 332 and placed a colony of Jews there<br>
 which flourished greatly, one-third of the population at this<br>
 time. There was a great university and library there. The<br>
 Jewish-Alexandrian philosophy developed here of which Philo was<br>
 the chief exponent who was still living. Apollos was undoubtedly<br>
 a man of the schools and a man of parts. <B>{A learned man}</B> <b><i>(\an&#275;r<br>
 logios\)</i></b>. Or eloquent, as the word can mean either a man of words<br>
 <b><i>(like one "wordy," verbose)</i></b> or a man of ideas, since \logos\ was<br>
 used either for reason or speech. Apollos was doubtless both<br>
 learned <b><i>(mighty in the Scriptures)</i></b> and eloquent, though eloquence<br>
 varies greatly in people's ideas. <B>{Mighty in the Scriptures}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\dunatos &#333;n en tais graphais\)</i></b>. Being powerful <b><i>(\dunatos\ verbal<br>
 of \dunamai\ and same root as \dunamis\, dynamite, dynamo)</i></b> in the<br>
 Scriptures <b><i>(in the knowledge and the use of the Scriptures)</i></b>, as<br>
 should be true of every preacher. There is no excuse for<br>
 ignorance of the Scriptures on the part of preachers, the<br>
 professed interpreters of the word of God. The last lecture made<br>
 to the New Testament English class in Southern Baptist<br>
 Theological Seminary by John A. Broadus was on this passage with<br>
 a plea for his students to be mighty in the Scriptures. In<br>
 Alexandria Clement of Alexandria and Origen taught in the<br>
 Christian theological school.<br>
 <br>
 18:25 <B>{Had been instructed in the way of the Lord}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;n<br>
 kat&#275;ch&#275;menos t&#275;n hodon tou kuriou\)</i></b>. Periphrastic past perfect<br>
 passive of \kat&#275;che&#333;\, rare in the old Greek and not in the LXX<br>
 from \kata\ and \&#275;che&#333;\ <b><i>(\&#275;ch&#333;\, sound)</i></b> as in <!-#-->Lu 1:4, to<br>
 re-sound, to re-echo, to teach by repeated dinning into the ears<br>
 as the Arabs do now, to teach orally by word of mouth <b><i>(and ear)</i></b>.<br>
 Here the accusative of the thing <b><i>(the word)</i></b> is retained in the<br>
 passive like with \didask&#333;\, to teach <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p.<br>
 485)</i></b>. Being fervent in spirit <b><i>(\ze&#333;n t&#333;i pneumati\)</i></b>. Boiling<br>
 <b><i>(from \ze&#333;\, to boil, old and common verb, in N.T. only here and<br>
 <!-#-->Ro 12:11)</i></b> like boiling water or yeast. The Latin verb _ferveo_<br>
 means to boil or ferment. Locative case after it. <B>{Taught<br>
 carefully}</B> <b><i>(\edidasken akrib&#333;s\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, was teaching<br>
 or inchoative, began teaching, accurately. He taught accurately<br>
 what he knew, a fine gift for any preacher. <B>{Only the baptism of<br>
 John}</B> <b><i>(\monon to baptisma I&#333;anou\)</i></b>. It was a <B>{baptism of<br>
 repentance}</B> <b><i>(marked by repentance)</i></b> as Paul said <b><i>(<!-#-->13:24; 19:4)</i></b>,<br>
 as Peter said <b><i>(<!-#-->2:38)</i></b> and as the Gospels tell <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:4, etc.)</i></b>.<br>
 That is to say, Apollos knew only what the Baptist knew when he<br>
 died, but John had preached the coming of the Messiah, had<br>
 baptized him, had identified him as the Son of God, had<br>
 proclaimed the baptism of the Holy Spirit, but had not seen the<br>
 Cross, the Resurrection of Jesus, nor the great Day of Pentecost.<br>
 <br>
 18:26 <B>{They took him unto them}</B> <b><i>(\proselabonto\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 middle <b><i>(indirect)</i></b> indicative of \proslamban&#333;\, old verb, to their<br>
 home and heart as companion <b><i>(cf. the rabbis and the ruffians in<br>
 <!-#-->17:5)</i></b>. Probably for dinner after service. <B>{Expounded}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\exethento\)</i></b>. Second aorist <b><i>(effective)</i></b> middle indicative of<br>
 \ektith&#275;mi\ seen already in <!-#-->11:4, to set forth. <B>{More<br>
 carefully}</B> <b><i>(\akribesteron\)</i></b>. Comparative adverb of \akrib&#333;s\.<br>
 More accurately than he already knew. Instead of abusing the<br>
 young and brilliant preacher for his ignorance they <b><i>(particularly<br>
 Priscilla)</i></b> gave him the fuller story of the life and work of<br>
 Jesus and of the apostolic period to fill up the gaps in his<br>
 knowledge. It is a needed and delicate task, this thing of<br>
 teaching gifted young ministers. They do not learn it all in<br>
 schools. More of it comes from contact with men and women rich in<br>
 grace and in the knowledge of God's ways. He was not rebaptized,<br>
 but only received fuller information.<br>
 <br>
 18:27 <B>{Encouraged him}</B> <b><i>(\protrepsamenoi\)</i></b>. First aorist middle<br>
 participle of \protrep&#333;\, old verb, to urge forward, to push on,<br>
 only here in the N.T. Since Apollos wanted <b><i>(\boulomenou autou\,<br>
 genitive absolute)</i></b> to go into Achaia, the brethren <b><i>(including<br>
 others besides Priscilla and Aquila)</i></b> wrote <b><i>(\egrapsan\)</i></b> a letter<br>
 of introduction to the disciples in Corinth to receive him<br>
 <b><i>(\apodexasthai auton\)</i></b>, a nice letter of recommendation and a<br>
 sincere one also. But Paul will refer to this very letter later<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->2Co 3:1)</i></b> and observe that he himself needed no such letter of<br>
 commendation. The Codex Bezae adds here that certain Corinthians<br>
 who had come to Ephesus heard Apollos and begged him to cross<br>
 over with them to Corinth. This may very well be the way that<br>
 Apollos was led to go. Preachers often receive calls because<br>
 visitors from other places hear them. Priscilla and Aquila were<br>
 well known in Corinth and their approval would carry weight. But<br>
 they did not urge Apollos to stay longer in Ephesus. <B>{Helped them<br>
 much}</B> <b><i>(\sunebaleto polu\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle indicative of<br>
 \sunball&#333;\ used in <!-#-->17:18 for "dispute," old verb to throw<br>
 together, in the N.T. always in the active save here in the<br>
 middle <b><i>(common in Greek writers)</i></b> to put together, to help.<br>
 <B>{Through grace}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#275;s charitos\)</i></b>. This makes sense if taken<br>
 with "believed," as Hackett does <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->13:48; 16:14)</i></b> or with<br>
 "helped" <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 3:10; 15:10; 2Co 1:12)</i></b>. Both are true as the<br>
 references show.<br>
 <br>
 18:28 <B>{Powerfully}</B> <b><i>(\euton&#333;s\)</i></b>. Adverb from \eutonos\ <b><i>(\eu\,<br>
 well, \tein&#333;\, to stretch)</i></b>, well-strung, at full stretch.<br>
 <B>{Confuted}</B> <b><i>(\diakat&#275;legcheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of the double<br>
 compound verb \dia-kat-elegchomai\, to confute with rivalry in a<br>
 contest, here alone. The old Greek has \dielegch&#333;\, to convict of<br>
 falsehood, but not this double compound which means to argue down<br>
 to a finish. It is the imperfect tense and does not mean that<br>
 Apollos convinced these rabbis, but he had the last word.<br>
 <B>{Publicly}</B> <b><i>(\d&#275;mosi&#257;i\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->5:18; 16:37. In open meeting where<br>
 all could see the victory of Apollos. <B>{Shewing}</B> <b><i>(\epideiknus\)</i></b>.<br>
 Present active participle of \epideiknumi\, old verb to set forth<br>
 so that all see. <B>{By the Scriptures}</B> <b><i>(\dia t&#333;n graph&#333;n\)</i></b>. In<br>
 which Apollos was so "mighty" <b><i>(verse <!-#-->24)</i></b> and the rabbis so weak<br>
 for they knew the oral law better than the written <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 7:8-12)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{That Jesus was the Christ}</B> <b><i>(\einai ton Christon I&#275;soun\)</i></b>.<br>
 Infinitive and the accusative in indirect assertion. Apollos<br>
 proclaims the same message that Paul did everywhere <b><i>(<!-#-->17:3)</i></b>. He<br>
 had not yet met Paul, but he had been instructed by Priscilla and<br>
 Aquila. He is in Corinth building on the foundation laid so well<br>
 by Paul <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 3:4-17)</i></b>. Luke has here made a brief digression<br>
 from the story of Paul, but it helps us understand Paul better<br>
 There are those who think that Apollos wrote Hebrews, a guess<br>
 that may be correct.<br>
