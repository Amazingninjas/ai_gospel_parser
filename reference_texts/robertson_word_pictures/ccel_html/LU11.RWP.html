<p>11:1 <B>{As he was praying in a certain place}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i einai auton<br>
 en top&#333;i tini proseuchomenon\)</i></b>. Characteristically Lukan idiom:<br>
 \en\ with articular periphrastic infinitive <b><i>(\einai<br>
 proseuchomenon\)</i></b> with accusative of general reference <b><i>(\auton\)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{That}</B>. Not in the Greek, asyndeton <b><i>(\kai egeneto eipen\)</i></b>. <B>{When<br>
 he ceased}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;s epausato\)</i></b>. Supply \proseuchomenos\ <b><i>(praying)</i></b>,<br>
 complementary or supplementary participle. <B>{Teach us}</B> <b><i>(\didaxon<br>
 h&#275;mas\)</i></b>. Jesus had taught them by precept <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 6:7-15)</i></b> and<br>
 example <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 9:29)</i></b>. Somehow the example of Jesus on this<br>
 occasion stirred them to fresh interest in the subject and to<br>
 revival of interest in John's teachings <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 5:33)</i></b>. So Jesus<br>
 gave them the substance of the Model Prayer in Matthew, but in<br>
 shorter form. Some of the MSS. have one or all of the phrases in<br>
 Matthew, but the oldest documents have it in the simplest form.<br>
 See on &#175;Mt 6:7-15 for discussion of these details <b><i>(Father,<br>
 hallowed, kingdom, daily bread, forgiveness, bringing us into<br>
 temptation)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Mt 6:11 "give" is \dos\ <b><i>(second aorist active<br>
 imperative second singular, a single act)</i></b> while here <!-#-->Lu 11:3<br>
 "give" is \didou\ <b><i>(present active imperative, both from \did&#333;mi\)</i></b><br>
 and means, "keep on giving." So in <!-#-->Lu 11:4 we have "For we<br>
 ourselves also forgive" <b><i>(\kai gar autoi aphiomen\)</i></b>, present<br>
 active indicative of the late \&#333;\ verb \aphi&#333;\ while <!-#-->Mt 6:12<br>
 has "as we also forgave" <b><i>(\h&#333;s kai h&#275;meis aph&#275;kamen\)</i></b>, first<br>
 aorist <b><i>(\k\ aorist)</i></b> active of \aphi&#275;mi\. So also where <!-#-->Mt 6:12<br>
 has "debts" <b><i>(\ta opheil&#275;mata\)</i></b> <!-#-->Lu 11:4 has "sins" <b><i>(\tas<br>
 hamartias\)</i></b>. But the spirit of each prayer is the same. There is<br>
 no evidence that Jesus meant either form to be a ritual. In both<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 6:13; Lu 11:4 \m&#275; eisenegk&#275;is\ occurs <b><i>(second aorist<br>
 subjunctive with \m&#275;\ in prohibition, ingressive aorist)</i></b>. "Bring<br>
 us not" is a better translation than "lead us not." There is no<br>
 such thing as God enticing one to sin <b><i>(<!-#-->Jas 1:13)</i></b>. Jesus urges<br>
 us to pray not to be tempted as in <!-#-->Lu 22:40 in Gethsemane.<br>
 <br>
 11:5 <B>{At midnight}</B> <b><i>(\mesonuktiou\)</i></b>. Genitive of time. <B>{And say to<br>
 him}</B> <b><i>(\kai eip&#275;i aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. This is the deliberative subjunctive,<br>
 but it is preceded by two future indicatives that are<br>
 deliberative also <b><i>(\hexei, poreusetai\)</i></b>. <B>{Lend me}</B> <b><i>(\chr&#275;son<br>
 moi\)</i></b>. First aorist active imperative second singular. Lend me<br>
 <B>{now}</B>. From \kichr&#275;mi\, an old verb, to lend as a matter of<br>
 friendly interest as opposed to \daneiz&#333;\, to lend on interest as<br>
 a business. Only here in the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 11:6 <B>{To set before him}</B> <b><i>(\ho parath&#275;s&#333; aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. <B>{Which I shall<br>
 place beside him}</B>. Future active of \paratith&#275;mi\. See <!-#-->9:16 for<br>
 this same verb.<br>
 <br>
 11:7 <B>{And he}</B> <b><i>(\kakeinos\)</i></b>. Emphatic. <B>{Shall say}</B> <b><i>(\eip&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Still the aorist active deliberative subjunctive as in verse <!-#-->5<br>
 <b><i>(the same long and somewhat involved sentence)</i></b>. <B>{Trouble me not}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\m&#275; moi kopous pareche\)</i></b>. \M&#275;\ and the present imperative<br>
 active. Literally, "Stop furnishing troubles to me." On this use<br>
 of \kopous parech&#333;\ see also <!-#-->Mt 26:10; Mr 14:6; Ga 6:17 and the<br>
 singular \kopon\, <!-#-->Lu 18:5. <B>{The door is now shut}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;d&#275; h&#275;<br>
 thura kekleistai\)</i></b>. Perfect passive indicative, shut to stay<br>
 shut. Oriental locks are not easy to unlock. From \klei&#333;\, common<br>
 verb. <B>{In bed}</B> <b><i>(\eis ten koit&#275;n\)</i></b>. Note use of \eis\ in sense of<br>
 \en\. Often a whole family would sleep in the same room. <B>{I<br>
 cannot}</B> <b><i>(\ou dunamai\)</i></b>. That is, I am not willing.<br>
 <br>
 11:8 <B>{Though}</B> <b><i>(\ei kai\)</i></b>. \Kai ei\ would be "Even if," a<br>
 different idea. <B>{Because he is his friend}</B> <b><i>(\dia to einai philon<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. \Dia\ and the accusative articular infinitive with<br>
 accusative of general reference, a causal clause="because of the<br>
 being a friend of his." <B>{Yet because of his importunity}</B> <b><i>(\dia ge<br>
 t&#275;n anaidian autou\)</i></b>. From \anaid&#275;s\, shameless, and that from<br>
 \a\ privative and \aid&#333;s\, shame, shamelessness, impudence. An<br>
 old word, but here alone in the N.T. Examples in the papyri. The<br>
 use of \ge\ here, one of the intensive particles, is to be noted.<br>
 It sharpens the contrast to "though" by "yet." As examples of<br>
 importunate prayer Vincent notes Abraham in behalf of Sodom <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge<br>
 18:23-33)</i></b> and the Syro-Phoenician woman in behalf of her<br>
 daughter <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 15:22-28)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:9 <B>{Shall be opened}</B> <b><i>(\anoig&#275;setai\)</i></b>. Second future passive<br>
 third singular of \anoignumi\ and the later \anoig&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 11:11 <B>{Of which of you that is a father}</B> <b><i>(\tina de ex hum&#333;n ton<br>
 patera\)</i></b>. There is a decided anacoluthon here. The MSS. differ a<br>
 great deal. The text of Westcott and Hort makes \ton patera\ <b><i>(the<br>
 father)</i></b> in apposition with \tina\ <b><i>(of whom)</i></b> and in the accusative<br>
 the object of \ait&#275;sei\ <b><i>(shall ask)</i></b> which has also another<br>
 accusative <b><i>(both person and thing)</i></b> "a loaf." So far so good. But<br>
 the rest of the sentence is, <B>{will ye give him a stone?}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;<br>
 lithon epid&#333;sei aut&#333;i;\)</i></b>. \M&#275;\ shows that the answer No is<br>
 expected, but the trouble is that the interrogative \tina\ in the<br>
 first clause is in the accusative the object of \ait&#275;sei\ while<br>
 here the same man <b><i>(he)</i></b> is the subject of \epid&#333;sei\. It is a very<br>
 awkward piece of Greek and yet it is intelligible. Some of the<br>
 old MSS. do not have the part about "loaf" and "stone," but only<br>
 the two remaining parts about "fish" and "serpent," "egg" and<br>
 "scorpion." The same difficult construction is carried over into<br>
 these questions also.<br>
 <br>
 11:13 <B>{Know how to give}</B> <b><i>(\oidate didonai\)</i></b>. See on <!-#-->Mt 7:11 for<br>
 this same saying. Only here Jesus adds the Holy Spirit <b><i>(\pneuma<br>
 hagion\)</i></b> as the great gift <b><i>(the _summum bonum_)</i></b> that the Father<br>
 is ready to bestow. Jesus is fond of "how much more" <b><i>(\pos&#333;i<br>
 m&#257;llon\, by how much more, instrumental case)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:14 <B>{When}</B> <b><i>(\tou daimoniou exelthontos\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute ana<br>
 asyndeton between \kai egeneto\ and \elal&#275;sen\ as often in Luke<br>
 <b><i>(no \hoti\ or \kai\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:15 <B>{Dumb}</B> <b><i>(\k&#333;phon\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 9:32. <B>{By Beelzebub}</B> <b><i>(\en<br>
 Beezeboul\)</i></b>. Blasphemous accusation here in Judea as in Galilee<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 3:22; Mt 12:24,27)</i></b>. See on Matthew for discussion of the<br>
 form of this name and the various items in the sin against the<br>
 Holy Spirit involved in the charge. It was useless to deny the<br>
 fact of the miracles. So they were explained as wrought by Satan<br>
 himself, a most absurd explanation.<br>
 <br>
 11:16 <B>{Tempting him}</B> <b><i>(\peirazontes\)</i></b>. These "others" <b><i>(\heteroi\)</i></b><br>
 apparently realized the futility of the charge of being in league<br>
 with Beelzebub. Hence they put up to Jesus the demand for "a sign<br>
 from heaven" just as had been done in Galilee <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 12:38)</i></b>. By<br>
 "sign" <b><i>(\s&#275;meion\)</i></b> they meant a great spectacular display of<br>
 heavenly power such as they expected the Messiah to give and such<br>
 as the devil suggested to Jesus on the pinnacle of the temple.<br>
 <B>{Sought}</B> <b><i>(\ez&#275;toun\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, kept on seeking.<br>
 <br>
 11:17 <B>{But he}</B> <b><i>(\autos de\)</i></b>. In contrast with them. <B>{Knowing<br>
 their thoughts}</B> <b><i>(\eid&#333;s aut&#333;n ta diano&#275;mata\)</i></b>. From \dianoe&#333;\, to<br>
 think through or distinguish. This substantive is common in<br>
 Plato, but occurs nowhere else in the N.T. It means intent,<br>
 purpose. Jesus knew that they were trying to tempt him. <B>{And a<br>
 house divided against a house falleth}</B> <b><i>(\kai oikos epi oikon<br>
 piptei\)</i></b>. It is not certain that \diameristheisa\ <b><i>(divided)</i></b> is to<br>
 be repeated here as in <!-#-->Mt 12:25; Mr 3:25. It may mean, <B>{and<br>
 house falls upon house}</B>, "one tumbling house knocking down its<br>
 neighbour, a graphic picture of what happens when a kingdom is<br>
 divided against itself" <b><i>(Bruce)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:18 <B>{Because ye say}</B> <b><i>(\hoti legete\)</i></b>. Jesus here repeats in<br>
 indirect discourse <b><i>(accusative and infinitive)</i></b> the charge made<br>
 against him in verse <!-#-->15. The condition is of the first class,<br>
 determined as fulfilled.<br>
 <br>
 11:19 <B>{And if I by Beelzebub}</B> <b><i>(\ei de eg&#333; en Beezeboul\)</i></b>. Also a<br>
 condition of the first class, determined as fulfilled. A Greek<br>
 condition deals only with the _statement_, not with the actual<br>
 facts. For sake of argument, Jesus here assumes that he casts out<br>
 demons by Beelzebub. The conclusion is a _reductio ad absurdum_.<br>
 The Jewish exorcists practiced incantations against demons <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac<br>
 19:13)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:20 <B>{By the finger of God}</B> <b><i>(\en daktul&#333;i theou\)</i></b>. In<br>
 distinction from the Jewish exorcists. <!-#-->Mt 12:28 has "by the<br>
 Spirit of God." <B>{Then is come}</B> <b><i>(\ara ephthasen\)</i></b>. \Phthan&#333;\ in<br>
 late Greek comes to mean simply to come, not to come before. The<br>
 aorist indicative tense here is timeless. Note \ara\<br>
 <b><i>(accordingly)</i></b> in the conclusion <b><i>(\apodosis\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:21 <B>{Fully armed}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#333;plismenos\)</i></b>. Perfect passive<br>
 participle of \kathopliz&#333;\, an old verb, but here only in the<br>
 N.T. Note perfective use of \kata\ in composition with \hopliz&#333;\,<br>
 to arm <b><i>(from \hopla\, arms)</i></b>. Note indefinite temporal clause<br>
 <b><i>(\hotan\ and present subjunctive \phulass&#275;i\)</i></b>. <B>{His own court}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\t&#275;n heautou aul&#275;n\)</i></b>. His own homestead. <!-#-->Mr 3:27; Mt 12:29 has<br>
 "house" <b><i>(\oikian\)</i></b>. \Aul&#275;\ is used in the N.T. in various senses<br>
 <b><i>(the court in front of the house, the court around which the<br>
 house is built, then the house as a whole)</i></b>. <B>{His goods}</B> <b><i>(\ta<br>
 huparchonta autou\)</i></b>. "His belongings." Neuter plural present<br>
 active participle of \huparch&#333;\ used as substantive with<br>
 genitive.<br>
 <br>
 11:22 <B>{But when}</B> <b><i>(\epan de\)</i></b>. Note \hotan\ in verse <!-#-->21.<br>
 <B>{Stronger than he}</B> <b><i>(\ischuroteros autou\)</i></b>. Comparative of<br>
 \ischuros\ followed by the ablative. <B>{Come upon him and overcome<br>
 him}</B> <b><i>(\epelth&#333;n nik&#275;s&#275;i auton\)</i></b>. Second aorist active participle<br>
 of \eperchomai\ and first aorist active subjunctive of \nika&#333;\.<br>
 Aorist tense here because a single onset while in verse <!-#-->22 the<br>
 guarding <b><i>(\phulass&#275;i\, present active subjunctive)</i></b> is continuous.<br>
 <B>{His whole armour}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n panoplian autou\)</i></b>. An old and common<br>
 word for all the soldier's outfit <b><i>(shield, sword, lance, helmet,<br>
 greaves, breastplate)</i></b>. Tyndale renders it "his harness." In the<br>
 N.T. only here and <!-#-->Eph 6:11,13 where the items are given.<br>
 <B>{Wherein he trusted}</B> <b><i>(\eph' h&#275;i epepoithei\)</i></b>. Second past perfect<br>
 active of \peith&#333;\, to persuade. The second perfect \pepoitha\ is<br>
 intransitive, to trust. Old and common verb. He trusted his<br>
 weapons which had been so efficacious. <B>{His spoils}</B> <b><i>(\ta skula<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. It is not clear to what this figure refers. Strong as<br>
 Satan is Jesus is stronger and wins victories over him as he was<br>
 doing then. In <!-#-->Col 2:15 Christ is pictured as triumphing openly<br>
 over the powers of evil by the Cross.<br>
 <br>
 11:23 <B>{He that is not with me}</B> <b><i>(\ho m&#275; &#333;n met' emou\)</i></b>. This verse<br>
 is just like <!-#-->Mt 12:30.<br>
 <br>
 11:24 <B>{And finding none}</B> <b><i>(\kai m&#275; heuriskon\)</i></b>. Here <!-#-->Mt 12:43<br>
 has \kai ouch heuriskei\ <b><i>(present active indicative instead of<br>
 present active participle)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu 11:24-26 is almost verbatim like<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 12:43-45, which see. Instead of just "taketh"<br>
 <b><i>(\paralambanei\)</i></b> in verse <!-#-->26, Matthew has "taketh with himself"<br>
 <b><i>(\paralambanei meth' heautou\)</i></b>. And Luke omits: "Even so shall it<br>
 be also unto this evil generation" of <!-#-->Mt 12:45. <B>{Than the<br>
 first}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;n pr&#333;t&#333;n\)</i></b>. Ablative case after the comparative<br>
 \cheirona\. The seven demons brought back remind one of the seven<br>
 that afflicted Mary Magdalene <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:2)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:27 <B>{As he said these things}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i legein auton\)</i></b>. Luke's<br>
 common idiom, \en\ with articular infinitive. Verses <!-#-->27,28 are<br>
 peculiar to Luke. His Gospel in a special sense is the Gospel of<br>
 Woman. This woman "speaks well, but womanly" <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>. Her<br>
 beatitude <b><i>(\makaria\)</i></b> reminds us of Elisabeth's words <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:42,<br>
 \eulog&#275;men&#275;\)</i></b>. She is fulfilling Mary's own prophecy in <!-#-->1:48<br>
 <b><i>(\makariousin me\, shall call me happy)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:28 <B>{But he said}</B> <b><i>(\autos de eipen\)</i></b>. Jesus in contrast turns<br>
 attention to others and gives them a beatitude <b><i>(\makarioi\)</i></b>. "The<br>
 originality of Christ's reply guarantees its historical<br>
 character. Such a comment is beyond the reach of an inventor"<br>
 <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:29 <B>{Were gathering together unto him}</B> <b><i>(\epathroizomen&#333;n\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute present middle participle of \epathroiz&#333;\, a<br>
 rare verb, Plutarch and here only in the N.T., from \epi\ and<br>
 \athroiz&#333;\ <b><i>(a common enough verb)</i></b>. It means to throng together<br>
 <b><i>(\athroos\, in throngs)</i></b>. Vivid picture of the crowds around<br>
 Jesus. <B>{But the sign of Jonah}</B> <b><i>(\ei m&#275; to s&#275;meion I&#333;n&#257;\)</i></b>. Luke<br>
 does not give here the burial and resurrection of Jesus of which<br>
 Jonah's experience in the big fish was a type <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 12:39ff.)</i></b>,<br>
 but that is really implied <b><i>(Plummer argues)</i></b> by the use here of<br>
 "shall be given" <b><i>(\doth&#275;setai\)</i></b> and "shall be" <b><i>(\estai\)</i></b>, for the<br>
 resurrection of Jesus is still future. The preaching of Jesus<br>
 ought to have been sign enough as in the case of Jonah, but the<br>
 resurrection will be given. Luke's report is much briefer and<br>
 omits what is in <!-#-->Mt 12:41.<br>
 <br>
 11:31 <B>{With the men of this generation}</B> <b><i>(\meta t&#333;n andr&#333;n t&#275;s<br>
 gene&#257;s taut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Here <!-#-->Mt 12:42 has simply "with this<br>
 generation," which see.<br>
 <br>
 11:32 <B>{At the preaching of Jonah}</B> <b><i>(\eis to k&#275;rugma I&#333;na\)</i></b>. Note<br>
 this use of \eis\ as in <!-#-->Mt 10:41; 12:41. Luke inserts the words<br>
 about the Queen of the South <b><i>(<!-#-->31)</i></b> in between the discussion of<br>
 Jonah <b><i>(verses <!-#-->29f., 32)</i></b>. Both \Solom&#333;nos\ <b><i>(<!-#-->31)</i></b> and \I&#333;n&#257;\<br>
 <b><i>(verse <!-#-->32)</i></b> are in the ablative case after the comparative<br>
 \pleion\ <b><i>(more, <B>{something more}</B>)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:33 <B>{In a cellar}</B> <b><i>(\eis krupt&#275;n\)</i></b>. A crypt <b><i>(same word)</i></b> or<br>
 hidden place from \krupt&#333;\, to hide. Late and rare word and here<br>
 only in the N.T. These other words <b><i>(lamp, \luchnon\, bushel,<br>
 \modion\, stand, \luchnian\)</i></b> have all been discussed previously<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 5:15)</i></b>. <!-#-->Lu 11:33 is like <!-#-->Mt 6:22f., which see for<br>
 details.<br>
 <br>
 11:35 <B>{Whether not}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;\)</i></b>. This use of \m&#275;\ in an indirect<br>
 question is good Greek <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1045)</i></b>. It is a<br>
 pitiful situation if the very light is darkness. This happens<br>
 when the eye of the soul is too diseased to see the light of<br>
 Christ.<br>
 <br>
 11:36 <B>{With its bright shining}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;i astrap&#275;i\)</i></b>. Instrumental<br>
 case, as if by a flash of lightning the light is revealed in him.<br>
 See on &#175;10:18.<br>
 <br>
 11:37 <B>{Now as he spake}</B> <b><i>(\en de t&#333;i lal&#275;sai\)</i></b>. Luke's common<br>
 idiom, \en\ with the articular infinitive <b><i>(aorist active<br>
 infinitive)</i></b> but it does not mean "after he had spoken" as Plummer<br>
 argues, but simply "in the speaking," no time in the aorist<br>
 infinitive. See <!-#-->3:21 for similar use of aorist infinitive with<br>
 \en\. <B>{Asketh}</B> <b><i>(\er&#333;t&#257;i\)</i></b>. Present active indicative, dramatic<br>
 present. Request, not question. <B>{To dine}</B> <b><i>(\hop&#333;s arist&#275;s&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Note \hop&#333;s\ rather than the common \hina\. Aorist active<br>
 subjunctive rather than present, for a single meal. The verb is<br>
 from \ariston\ <b><i>(breakfast)</i></b>. See distinction between \ariston\ and<br>
 \deipnon\ <b><i>(dinner or supper)</i></b> in <!-#-->Lu 14:12. It is the morning<br>
 meal <b><i>(breakfast or lunch)</i></b> after the return from morning prayers<br>
 in the synagogue <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 22:4)</i></b>, not the very early meal called<br>
 \akratisma\. The verb is, however, used for the early meal on the<br>
 seashore in <!-#-->Joh 21:12,15. <B>{With him}</B> <b><i>(\par' aut&#333;i\)</i></b>. By his<br>
 side. <B>{Sat down to meat}</B> <b><i>(\anepesen\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 indicative of \anapipt&#333;\, old verb, to recline, to fall back on<br>
 the sofa or lounge. No word here for "to meat."<br>
 <br>
 11:38 <B>{That he had not first washed before dinner}</B> <b><i>(\hoti ou<br>
 pr&#333;ton ebaptisth&#275; pro tou aristou\)</i></b>. The verb is first aorist<br>
 passive indicative of \baptiz&#333;\, to dip or to immerse. Here it is<br>
 applied to the hands. It was the Jewish custom to dip the hands<br>
 in water before eating and often between courses for ceremonial<br>
 purification. In Galilee the Pharisees and scribes had sharply<br>
 criticized the disciples for eating with unwashed hands <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 7:1-23; Mt 15:1-20)</i></b> when Jesus had defended their liberty and<br>
 had opposed making a necessity of such a custom <b><i>(tradition)</i></b> in<br>
 opposition to the command of God. Apparently Jesus on this<br>
 occasion had himself reclined at the breakfast <b><i>(not dinner)</i></b><br>
 without this ceremonial dipping of the hands in water. The Greek<br>
 has "first before" <b><i>(\pr&#333;ton pro\)</i></b>, a tautology not preserved in<br>
 the translation.<br>
 <br>
 11:39 <B>{The Lord}</B> <b><i>(\ho kurios\)</i></b>. The Lord Jesus plainly and in the<br>
 narrative portion of Luke. <B>{Now}</B> <b><i>(\nun\)</i></b>. Probably refers to him.<br>
 You Pharisees do now what was formerly done. <B>{The platter}</B> <b><i>(\tou<br>
 pinakos\)</i></b>. The dish. Old word, rendered "the charger" in <!-#-->Mt<br>
 14:8. Another word for "platter" <b><i>(\paropsis\)</i></b> in <!-#-->Mt 23:25<br>
 means "side-dish." <B>{But your inward part}</B> <b><i>(\to de es&#333;then<br>
 hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. The part within you <b><i>(Pharisees)</i></b>. They keep the external<br>
 regulations, but their hearts are full of plunder <b><i>(\harpag&#275;s\,<br>
 from \harpaz&#333;\, to seize)</i></b> and wickedness <b><i>(\pon&#275;rias\, from<br>
 \pon&#275;ros\, evil man)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mt 23:25 for a like indictment of the<br>
 Pharisees for care for the outside of the cup but neglect of what<br>
 is on the inside. Both inside and outside should be clean, but<br>
 the inside first.<br>
 <br>
 11:40 <B>{Howbeit}</B> <b><i>(\pl&#275;n\)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Lu 6:24. Instead of devoting so<br>
 much attention to the outside. <B>{Those things which are within}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ta enonta\)</i></b>. Articular neuter plural participle from \eneimi\,<br>
 to be in, common verb. This precise phrase only here in the N.T.<br>
 though in the papyri, and it is not clear what it means.<br>
 Probably, give as alms the things within the dishes, that is have<br>
 inward righteousness with a brotherly spirit and the outward<br>
 becomes "clean" <b><i>(\kathara\)</i></b>. Properly understood, this is not<br>
 irony and is not Ebionism, but good Christianity <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:42 <B>{Tithe}</B> <b><i>(\apodekatoute\)</i></b>. Late verb for the more common<br>
 \dekateu&#333;\. So in <!-#-->Mt 23:23. Take a tenth off <b><i>(\apo-\)</i></b>. Rue<br>
 <b><i>(\p&#275;ganon\)</i></b>. Botanical term in late writers from \p&#275;gnumi\, to<br>
 make fast because of its thick leaves. Here <!-#-->Mt 23:23 has<br>
 "anise." <B>{Every herb}</B> <b><i>(\p&#257;n lachanon\)</i></b>. General term as in <!-#-->Mr<br>
 4:32. Matthew has "cummin." <B>{Pass by}</B> <b><i>(\parerchesthe\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 middle indicative of \parerchomai\, common verb, to go by or<br>
 beside. <!-#-->Mt 23:23 has "ye have left undone" <b><i>(\aph&#275;kate\)</i></b>. Luke<br>
 here has "love" <b><i>(\agap&#275;n\)</i></b>, not in Matthew. <B>{Ought}</B> <b><i>(\edei\)</i></b>. As<br>
 in Matthew. Imperfect of a present obligation, not lived up to<br>
 just like our "ought" <b><i>(\owed\, not paid)</i></b>. \Pareinai\, as in<br>
 Matthew, the second aorist active infinitive of \aphi&#275;mi\. to<br>
 leave off. Common verb. Luke does not have the remark about<br>
 straining out the gnat and swallowing the camel <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 23:34)</i></b>. It<br>
 is plain that the terrible exposure of the scribes and Pharisees<br>
 in <!-#-->Mt 23 in the temple was simply the culmination of previous<br>
 conflicts such as this one.<br>
 <br>
 11:43 <B>{The chief seats in the synagogues}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n pr&#333;tokathedrian<br>
 en tais sunag&#333;gais\)</i></b>. Singular here, plural in <!-#-->Mt 23:6. This<br>
 semi-circular bench faced the congregation. <!-#-->Mt 23:6 has also<br>
 the chief place at feasts given by Luke also in that discourse<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->20:46)</i></b> as well as in <!-#-->14:7, a marked characteristic of the<br>
 Pharisees.<br>
 <br>
 11:44 <B>{The tombs which appear not}</B> <b><i>(\ta mn&#275;neia ta ad&#275;la\)</i></b>. These<br>
 hidden graves would give ceremonial defilement for seven days<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 19:16)</i></b>. Hence they were usually whitewashed as a warning.<br>
 So in <!-#-->Mt 23:27 the Pharisees are called "whited sepulchres."<br>
 Men do not know how rotten they are. The word \ad&#275;los\ <b><i>(\a\<br>
 privative and \d&#275;los\, apparent or plain)</i></b> occurs in the N.T. only<br>
 here and <!-#-->1Co 14:8, though an old and common word. <B>{Here men<br>
 walking around}</B> <b><i>(\peripatountes\)</i></b> walk over the tombs without<br>
 knowing it. These three woes cut to the quick and evidently made<br>
 the Pharisees wince.<br>
 <br>
 11:45 <B>{Thou reproachest us also}</B> <b><i>(\kai h&#275;m&#257;s hubrizeis\)</i></b>. Because<br>
 the lawyers <b><i>(scribes)</i></b> were usually Pharisees. The verb \hubriz&#333;\<br>
 is an old one and common for outrageous treatment, a positive<br>
 insult <b><i>(so <!-#-->Lu 18:32; Mt 22:6; Ac 14;5; 1Th 2:2)</i></b>. So Jesus<br>
 proceeds to give the lawyers three woes as he had done to the<br>
 Pharisees.<br>
 <br>
 11:46 <B>{Grievous to be borne}</B> <b><i>(\dusbastakta\)</i></b>. A late word in LXX<br>
 and Plutarch <b><i>(\dus\ and \bastaz&#333;\)</i></b>. Here alone in text of<br>
 Westcott and Hort who reject it in <!-#-->Mt 23:4 where we have "heavy<br>
 burdens" <b><i>(\phortia barea\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Gal 6:2 we have \bar&#275;\ with a<br>
 distinction drawn. Here we have \phortizete\ <b><i>(here only in the<br>
 N.T. and <!-#-->Mt 11:28)</i></b> for "lade," \phortia\ as cognate accusative<br>
 and then \phortiois\ <b><i>(dative after \ou prospsauete\, touch not)</i></b>.<br>
 It is a fierce indictment of scribes <b><i>(lawyers)</i></b> for their<br>
 pettifogging interpretations of the written law in their oral<br>
 teaching <b><i>(later written down as _Mishna_ and then as _Gemarah_)</i></b>,<br>
 a terrible load which these lawyers did not pretend to carry<br>
 themselves, not even "with one of their fingers" to "touch"<br>
 <b><i>(\prospsau&#333;\, old verb but only here in the N.T.)</i></b>, touch with the<br>
 view to remove. <!-#-->Mt 23:4 has \kin&#275;sai\, to move. A physician<br>
 would understand the meaning of \prospau&#333;\ for feeling gently a<br>
 sore spot or the pulse.<br>
 <br>
 11:48 <B>{Consent}</B> <b><i>(\suneudokeite\)</i></b>. Double compound <b><i>(\sun, eu,<br>
 doke&#333;\)</i></b>, to think well along with others, to give full approval.<br>
 A late verb, several times in the N.T., in <!-#-->Ac 8:1 of Saul's<br>
 consenting to and agreeing to Stephen's death. It is a somewhat<br>
 subtle, but just, argument made here. Outwardly the lawyers build<br>
 tombs for the prophets whom their fathers <b><i>(forefathers)</i></b> killed as<br>
 if they disapproved what their fathers did. But in reality they<br>
 neglect and oppose what the prophets teach just as their fathers<br>
 did. So they are "witnesses" <b><i>(\martures\)</i></b> against themselves <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 23:31)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:49 <B>{The wisdom of God}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; sophia tou theou\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Mt 23:34<br>
 Jesus uses "I send" <b><i>(\eg&#333; apostell&#333;\)</i></b> without this phrase "the<br>
 wisdom of God." There is no book to which it can refer. Jesus is<br>
 the wisdom of God as Paul shows <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 1:30)</i></b>, but it is hardly<br>
 likely that he so describes himself here. Probably he means that<br>
 God in his wisdom said, but even so "Jesus here speaks with<br>
 confident knowledge of the Divine counsels" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Lu<br>
 10:22; 15:7,10. Here the future tense occurs, "I will send"<br>
 <b><i>(\apostel&#333;\)</i></b>. <B>{Some of them}</B> <b><i>(\ex aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. No "some" <b><i>(\tinas\)</i></b> in<br>
 the Greek, but understood. They will act as their fathers did.<br>
 They will kill and persecute.<br>
 <br>
 11:50 <B>{That ... may be required}</B> <b><i>(\hina ... ekz&#275;t&#275;th&#275;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 Divinely ordered sequence, first aorist passive subjunctive of<br>
 \ekz&#275;te&#333;\, a late and rare verb outside of LXX and N.T.,<br>
 requiring as a debt the blood of the prophets. <B>{Which was shed}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\to ekkechumenon\)</i></b>. Perfect passive participle of \ekche&#333;\ and<br>
 \ekchunn&#333;\ <b><i>(an Aeolic form appearing in the margin of Westcott<br>
 and Hort here, \ekchunnomenon\, present passive participle)</i></b>. If<br>
 the present passive is accepted, it means the blood which is<br>
 perpetually shed from time to time. <B>{From the foundation of the<br>
 world}</B> <b><i>(\apo katabol&#275;s kosmou\)</i></b>. See also <!-#-->Mt 25:34; Joh 17:24;<br>
 Eph 1:4, etc. It is a bold metaphor for the purpose of God.<br>
 <br>
 11:51 <B>{From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah}</B> <b><i>(\apo<br>
 haimatos Abel he&#333;s haimatos Zachariou\)</i></b>. The blood of Abel is the<br>
 first shed in the Old Testament <b><i>(<!-#-->Ge 4:10)</i></b>, that of Zacharias<br>
 the last in the O.T. canon which ended with Chronicles <b><i>(<!-#-->2Ch<br>
 24:22)</i></b>. Chronologically the murder of Uriah by Jehoiakim was<br>
 later <b><i>(<!-#-->Jer 26:23)</i></b>, but this climax is from Genesis to II<br>
 Chronicles <b><i>(the last book in the canon)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mt 23:35 for<br>
 discussion of Zachariah as "the son of Barachiah" rather than<br>
 "the son of Jehoiada." <B>{Between the altar and the sanctuary}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\metaxu tou thusiast&#275;riou kai tou oikou\)</i></b>. Literally, between<br>
 the altar and the house <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 23:35 has temple, \naou\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 11:52 <B>{Ye took away the key of knowledge}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;rate t&#275;n kleida t&#275;s<br>
 gn&#333;se&#333;s\)</i></b>. First aorist active indicative of \air&#333;\, common verb.<br>
 But this is a flat charge of obscurantism on the part of these<br>
 scribes <b><i>(lawyers)</i></b>, the teachers <b><i>(rabbis)</i></b> of the people. They<br>
 themselves <b><i>(\autoi\)</i></b> refused to go into the house of knowledge<br>
 <b><i>(beautiful figure)</i></b> and learn. They then locked the door and hid<br>
 the key to the house of knowledge and hindered <b><i>(\ek&#333;lusate\,<br>
 effective aorist active)</i></b> those who were trying to enter <b><i>(\tous<br>
 eiserchomenous\, present participle, conative action)</i></b>. It is the<br>
 most pitiful picture imaginable of blind ecclesiastics trying to<br>
 keep others as blind as they were, blind leaders of the blind,<br>
 both falling into the pit.<br>
 <br>
 11:53 <B>{From thence}</B> <b><i>(\k'akeithen\)</i></b>. Out of the Pharisee's house.<br>
 What became of the breakfast we are not told, but the rage of<br>
 both Pharisees and lawyers knew no bounds. <B>{To press upon him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\enechein\)</i></b>. An old Greek verb to hold in, to be enraged at, to<br>
 have it in for one. It is the same verb used of the relentless<br>
 hatred of Herodias for John the Baptist <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 6:19)</i></b>. <B>{To provoke<br>
 him to speak}</B> <b><i>(\apostomatizein\)</i></b>. From \apo\ and \stoma\ <b><i>(mouth)</i></b>.<br>
 Plato uses it of repeating to a pupil for him to recite from<br>
 memory, then to recite by heart <b><i>(Plutarch)</i></b>. Here <b><i>(alone in the<br>
 N.T.)</i></b> the verb means to ply with questions, to entice to answers,<br>
 to catechize. <B>{Of many things}</B> <b><i>(\peri pleion&#333;n\)</i></b>. "Concerning<br>
 more <b><i>(comparative)</i></b> things." They were stung to the quick by these<br>
 woes which laid bare their hollow hypocrisy.<br>
 <br>
 11:54 <B>{Laying wait for him}</B> <b><i>(\enedreuontes auton\)</i></b>. An old verb<br>
 from \en\ and \hedra\, a seat, so to lie in ambush for one. Here<br>
 only and <!-#-->Ac 23:21 in the N.T. Vivid picture of the anger of<br>
 these rabbis who were treating Jesus as if he were a beast of<br>
 prey. <B>{To catch something out of his mouth}</B> <b><i>(\th&#275;reusai to ek tou<br>
 stomatos autou\)</i></b>. An old Greek verb, though here only in the<br>
 N.T., from \th&#275;ra\ <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ro 11:9)</i></b>, to ensnare, to catch in<br>
 hunting, to hunt. These graphic words from the chase show the<br>
 rage of the rabbis toward Jesus. Luke gives more details here<br>
 than in <!-#-->20:45-47; Mt 23:1-7, but there is no reason at all why<br>
 Jesus should not have had this conflict at the Pharisee's<br>
 breakfast before that in the temple in the great Tuesday debate.<br>
