<p>8:1 <B>{Soon afterwards}</B> <b><i>(\en t&#333;i kathex&#275;s\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->7:11 we have \en<br>
 t&#333;i hex&#275;s\. This word means one after the other, successively,<br>
 but that gives no definite data as to the time, only that this<br>
 incident in <!-#-->8:1-3 follows that in <!-#-->7:36-50. Both in Luke<br>
 alone. <B>{That}</B> <b><i>(\kai\)</i></b>. One of Luke's idioms with \kai egeneto\<br>
 like Hebrew _wav_. Went about <b><i>(\di&#333;deuen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active of<br>
 \diodeu&#333;\, to make one's way through <b><i>(\dia, hodos\)</i></b>, common in<br>
 late Greek writers. In the N.T. here only and <!-#-->Ac 17:1. <B>{Through<br>
 cities and villages}</B> <b><i>(\kata polin kai k&#333;m&#275;n\)</i></b>. Distributive use<br>
 of \kata\ <b><i>(up and down)</i></b>. The clause is amphibolous and goes<br>
 equally well with \di&#333;deuen\ or with \k&#275;russ&#333;n\ <b><i>(heralding)</i></b> \kai<br>
 euaggelizomenos\ <b><i>(evangelizing, gospelizing)</i></b>. This is the second<br>
 tour of Galilee, this time the Twelve with him.<br>
 <br>
 8:2 <B>{Which had been healed}</B> <b><i>(\hai &#275;san tetherapeumenai\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic past perfect passive, suggesting that the healing<br>
 had taken place some time before this tour. These women all had<br>
 personal grounds of gratitude to Jesus. <B>{From whom seven devils<br>
 <b><i>(demons)</i></b> had gone out}</B> <b><i>(\aph' h&#275;s daimonia hepta exel&#275;luthei\)</i></b>.<br>
 Past perfect active third singular for the \daimonia\ are neuter<br>
 plural. This first mention of Mary Magdalene describes her<br>
 special cause of gratitude. This fact is stated also in <!-#-->Mr 16:9<br>
 in the disputed close of the Gospel. The presence of seven demons<br>
 in one person indicates special malignity <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 5:9)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mt<br>
 17:45 for the parable of the demon who came back with seven<br>
 other demons worse than the first. It is not known where Magdala<br>
 was, whence Mary came.<br>
 <br>
 8:3 <B>{Joanna}</B> <b><i>(\I&#333;ana\)</i></b>. Her husband \Chuz&#257;\, steward<br>
 <b><i>(\epitropou\)</i></b> of Herod, is held by some to be the nobleman<br>
 <b><i>(\basilikos\)</i></b> of <!-#-->Joh 4:46-53 who believed and all his house. At<br>
 any rate Christ had a follower from the household of Herod<br>
 Antipas who had such curiosity to see and hear him. One may<br>
 recall also Manaen <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 13:1)</i></b>, Herod's foster brother. Joanna is<br>
 mentioned again with Mary Magdalene in <!-#-->Lu 24:10. <B>{Who<br>
 ministered unto them}</B> <b><i>(\haitines di&#275;konoun autois\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active of \diakone&#333;\, common verb, but note augment as if from<br>
 \dia\ and \akone&#333;\, but from \diakonos\ and that from \dia\ and<br>
 \konis\ <b><i>(dust)</i></b>. The very fact that Jesus now had twelve men going<br>
 with him called for help from others and the women of means<br>
 responded to the demand. <B>{Of their substance}</B> <b><i>(\ek t&#333;n<br>
 huparchont&#333;n autais\)</i></b>. From the things belonging to them. This is<br>
 the first woman's missionary society for the support of<br>
 missionaries of the Gospel. They had difficulties in their way,<br>
 but they overcame these, so great was their gratitude and zeal.<br>
 <br>
 8:4 <B>{By a parable}</B> <b><i>(\dia parabol&#275;s\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr 4:2 says "in parables"<br>
 as does <!-#-->Mt 13:3. This is the beginning of the first great group<br>
 of parables as given in <!-#-->Mr 4:1-34 and <!-#-->Mt 13:1-53. There are<br>
 ten of these parables in Mark and Matthew and only two in <!-#-->Lu<br>
 8:4-18 <b><i>(The Sower and the Lamp, <!-#-->8:16)</i></b> though Luke also has the<br>
 expression "in parables" <b><i>(<!-#-->8:10)</i></b>. See <!-#-->Mt 13 and <!-#-->Mr 4 for<br>
 discussion of the word parable and the details of the Parable of<br>
 the Sower. Luke does not locate the place, but he mentions the<br>
 great crowds on hand, while both Mark and Matthew name the<br>
 seaside as the place where Jesus was at the start of the series<br>
 of parables.<br>
 <br>
 8:5 <B>{His seed}</B> <b><i>(\ton sporon autou\)</i></b>. Peculiar to Luke. <B>{Was<br>
 trodden under foot}</B> <b><i>(\katepat&#275;th&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 indicative of \katapate&#333;\. Peculiar to Luke here. <B>{Of the<br>
 heavens}</B> <b><i>(\tou ouranou\)</i></b>. Added in Luke.<br>
 <br>
 8:6 <B>{Upon the rock}</B> <b><i>(\epi t&#275;n petran\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr 4:5 "the rocky<br>
 ground" <b><i>(\epi to petr&#333;des\)</i></b>, <!-#-->Mt 13:5 "the rocky places. <B>{As<br>
 soon as it grew}</B> <b><i>(\phuen\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive participle of<br>
 \phu&#333;\, an old verb to spring up like a sprout. <B>{Withered away}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ex&#275;ranth&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of \z&#275;rain&#333;\, old<br>
 verb, to dry up. <B>{Moisture}</B> <b><i>(\ikmada\)</i></b>. Here only in the N.T.,<br>
 though common word.<br>
 <br>
 8:7 <B>{Amidst the thorns}</B> <b><i>(\en mes&#333;i t&#333;n akanth&#333;n\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr 4:7 has<br>
 \eis\ <b><i>(among)</i></b> and <!-#-->Mt 13:7 has \epi\ "upon." <B>{Grew with it}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\sunphueisai\)</i></b>. Same participle as \phuen\ above with \sun-\<br>
 <b><i>(together)</i></b>. <B>{Choked}</B> <b><i>(\apepnixan\)</i></b>. From \apopnig&#333;\, to choke off<br>
 as in <!-#-->Mt 13:7. In <!-#-->Mr 4:7 the verb is \sunepnixan\ <b><i>(choked<br>
 together)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:8 <B>{A hundredfold}</B> <b><i>(\hekatonplasiona\)</i></b>. Luke omits the thirty<br>
 and sixty of <!-#-->Mr 4:8; Mt 13:8. <B>{He cried}</B> <b><i>(\eph&#333;nei\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active, and in a loud voice, the verb means. The warning about<br>
 hearing with the ears occurs also in <!-#-->Mr 4:9; Mt 13:9.<br>
 <br>
 8:9 <B>{Asked}</B> <b><i>(\ep&#275;r&#333;t&#333;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect of \eper&#333;ta&#333;\ <b><i>(\epi\ and<br>
 \er&#333;ta&#333;\)</i></b> where <!-#-->Mr 4:10 has \&#275;r&#333;t&#333;n\ <b><i>(uncompounded imperfect)</i></b>,<br>
 both the tense and the use of \epi\ indicate eager and repeated<br>
 questions on the part of the disciples, perhaps dimly perceiving<br>
 a possible reflection on their own growth. <B>{What this parable<br>
 might be}</B> <b><i>(\tis haut&#275; ei&#275; h&#275; parabol&#275;\)</i></b>. A mistranslation, What<br>
 this parable was <b><i>(or meant)</i></b>. The optative \ei&#275;\ is merely due to<br>
 indirect discourse, changing the indicative \estin\ <b><i>(is)</i></b> of the<br>
 direct question to the optative \ei&#275;\ of the indirect, a change<br>
 entirely with the writer or speaker and without any change of<br>
 meaning <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, pp. 1043f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:10 <B>{The mysteries}</B> <b><i>(\ta must&#275;ria\)</i></b>. See for this word on &#175;Mt<br>
 13:11; Mr 4:11. Part of the mystery here explained is how so<br>
 many people who have the opportunity to enter the kingdom fail to<br>
 do so because of manifest unfitness. <B>{That}</B> <b><i>(\hina\)</i></b>. Here <!-#-->Mr<br>
 4:11 also has \hina\ while <!-#-->Mt 13:13 has \hoti\ <b><i>(because)</i></b>. On<br>
 the so-called causal use of \hina\ as here equal to \hoti\ see<br>
 discussion on &#175;Mt 13:13; Mr 4:11. Plummer sensibly argues that<br>
 there is truth both in the causal \hoti\ of Matthew and the final<br>
 \hina\ of Mark and Matthew. "But the principle that he who hath<br>
 shall receive more, while he who hath not shall be deprived of<br>
 what he seemeth to have, explains both the \hina\ and the \hoti\.<br>
 Jesus speaks in parables because the multitudes see without<br>
 seeing and hear without hearing. But He also speaks in parable<br>
 <B>{in order that}</B> they may see without seeing and hear without<br>
 hearing." Only for "hearing" Luke has "understand" \suni&#333;sin\,<br>
 present subjunctive from a late omega form \suni&#333;\ instead of the<br>
 \-mi\ verb \suni&#275;mi\.<br>
 <br>
 8:11 <B>{Is this}</B> <b><i>(\estin de haut&#275;\)</i></b>. Means this. Jesus now proceeds<br>
 to interpret his own parable. <B>{The seed is the word of God}</B> <b><i>(\ho<br>
 sporos estin ho logos tou theou\)</i></b>. The article with both subject<br>
 and predicate as here means that they are interchangeable and can<br>
 be turned round: The word of God is the seed. The phrase "the<br>
 word of God" does not appear in Matthew and only once in Mark<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 7:13)</i></b> and John <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 10:35)</i></b>, but four times in Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->5:1;<br>
 8:11,21; 11:28)</i></b> and twelve times in Acts. In <!-#-->Mr 4:14 we have<br>
 only "the word." In <!-#-->Mr 3:31 we have "the will of God," and in<br>
 <!-#-->Mt 12:46 "the will of my Father" where <!-#-->Lu 8:21 has "the word<br>
 of God." This seems to show that Luke has the subjective genitive<br>
 here and means the word that comes from God.<br>
 <br>
 8:12 <B>{Those by the wayside}</B> <b><i>(\hoi para t&#275;n hodon\)</i></b>. As in <!-#-->Mr<br>
 4:15; Mt 13:19 so here the people who hear the word = the seed<br>
 are discussed by metonymy. <B>{The devil}</B> <b><i>(\ho diabolos\)</i></b>. The<br>
 slanderer. Here <!-#-->Mr 4:15 has Satan. <B>{From their heart}</B> <b><i>(\apo t&#275;s<br>
 kardias aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Here Mark has "in them." It is the devil's<br>
 business to snatch up the seed from the heart before it sprouts<br>
 and takes root. Every preacher knows how successful the devil is<br>
 with his auditors. <!-#-->Mt 13:19 has it "sown in the heart." <B>{That<br>
 they may not believe and be saved}</B> <b><i>(\hina m&#275; pisteusantes<br>
 s&#333;th&#333;sin\)</i></b>. Peculiar to Luke. Negative purpose with aorist active<br>
 participle and first aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> passive subjunctive.<br>
 Many reasons are offered today for the failure of preachers to<br>
 win souls. Here is the main one, the activity of the devil during<br>
 and after the preaching of the sermon. No wonder then that the<br>
 sower must have good seed and sow wisely, for even then he can<br>
 only win partial success.<br>
 <br>
 8:13 <B>{Which for a while believe}</B> <b><i>(\hoi pros kairon pisteuousin\)</i></b>.<br>
 Ostensibly they are sincere and have made a real start in the<br>
 life of faith. <B>{They fall away}</B> <b><i>(\aphistantai\)</i></b>. Present middle<br>
 indicative. They stand off, lose interest, stop coming to church,<br>
 drop out of sight. It is positively amazing the number of new<br>
 church members who "stumble" as <!-#-->Mr 4:17 has it<br>
 <b><i>(\skandalizontai\)</i></b>, do not like the pastor, take offence at<br>
 something said or done by somebody, object to the appeals for<br>
 money, feel slighted. The "season of trial" becomes a "season of<br>
 temptation" <b><i>(\en kair&#333;i peirasmou\)</i></b> for these superficial,<br>
 emotional people who have to be periodically rounded up if kept<br>
 within the fold.<br>
 <br>
 8:14 <B>{They are choked}</B> <b><i>(\sunpnigontai\)</i></b>. Present passive<br>
 indicative of this powerfully vivid compound verb \sunpnig&#333;\ used<br>
 in <!-#-->Mr 4:19; Mt 13:22, only there these worldly weeds choke the<br>
 word while here the victims themselves are choked. Both are true.<br>
 Diphtheria will choke and strangle the victim. Who has not seen<br>
 the promise of fair flower and fruit choked into yellow withered<br>
 stalk without fruit "as they go on their way" <b><i>(\poreuomenoi\)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Bring no fruit to perfection}</B> <b><i>(\ou telesphorousin\)</i></b>. Compound<br>
 verb common in the late writers <b><i>(\telos, phore&#333;\)</i></b>. To bring to<br>
 completion. Used of fruits, animals, pregnant women. Only here in<br>
 the N.T.<br>
 <br>
 8:15 <B>{In an honest and good heart}</B> <b><i>(\en kardi&#257;i kal&#275;i kai<br>
 agath&#275;i\)</i></b>. Peculiar to Luke. In verse <!-#-->8 the land <b><i>(\g&#275;n\)</i></b> is<br>
 called \agath&#275;n\ <b><i>(really good, generous)</i></b> and in verse <!-#-->15 we<br>
 have \en t&#275;i kal&#275;i g&#275;i\ <b><i>(<B>{in the beautiful or noble land}</B>)</i></b>. So<br>
 Luke uses both adjectives of the heart. The Greeks used \kalos k'<br>
 agathos\ of the high-minded gentleman. It is probable that Luke<br>
 knew this idiom. It occurs here alone in the N.T. It is not easy<br>
 to translate. We have such phrases as "good and true," "sound and<br>
 good," "right and good," no one of which quite suits the Greek.<br>
 Certainly Luke adds new moral qualities not in the Hellenic<br>
 phrase. The English word "honest" here is like the Latin<br>
 _honestus_ <b><i>(fair, noble)</i></b>. The words are to be connected with<br>
 "hold fast" <b><i>(\katechousin\)</i></b>, "hold it down" so that the devil<br>
 does not snatch it away, having depth of soil so that it does not<br>
 shrivel up under the sun, and is not choked by weeds and thorns.<br>
 It bears fruit <b><i>(\karpophorousin\, an old expressive verb,<br>
 \karpos\ and \phore&#333;\)</i></b>. That is the proof of spiritual life. <B>{In<br>
 patience}</B> <b><i>(\en hupomon&#275;i\)</i></b>. There is no other way for real fruit<br>
 to come. Mushrooms spring up overnight, but they are usually<br>
 poisonous. The best fruits require time, cultivation, patience.<br>
 <br>
 8:16 <B>{When he hath lighted a lamp}</B> <b><i>(\luchnon hapsas\)</i></b>. It is a<br>
 portable lamp <b><i>(\luchnon\)</i></b> that one lights <b><i>(\hapsas\ aorist active<br>
 participle of \hapt&#333;\, to kindle, fasten to, light)</i></b>. <B>{With a<br>
 vessel}</B> <b><i>(\skeuei\, instrumental case of \skeuos\)</i></b>. Here <!-#-->Mr 4:21<br>
 has the more definite figure "under the bushel" as has <!-#-->Mt 5:15.<br>
 <B>{Under the bed}</B> <b><i>(\hupokat&#333; klin&#275;s\)</i></b>. Here <!-#-->Mr 4:21 has the<br>
 regular \hupo t&#275;n klin&#275;n\ instead of the late compound<br>
 \hupokat&#333;\. Ragg notes that Matthew distributes the sayings of<br>
 Jesus given here by <!-#-->Lu 8:16-18; Mr 4:21-25 concerning the<br>
 parable of the lamp and gives them in three separate places <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 5:15; 10:26; 13:12)</i></b>. That is true, but it does not follow that<br>
 Mark and Luke have bunched together separate sayings or that<br>
 Matthew has scattered sayings delivered only on one occasion. One<br>
 of the slowest lessons for some critics to learn is that Jesus<br>
 repeated favourite sayings on different occasions and in<br>
 different groupings just as every popular preacher and teacher<br>
 does today. See on &#175;Mr 4:21 for further discussion of the lamp<br>
 and stand. <B>{May see the light}</B> <b><i>(\Blep&#333;sin to ph&#333;s\)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Mt 5:16<br>
 Jesus has it "may see your good works." The purpose of light is<br>
 to let one see something else, not the light. Note present<br>
 subjunctive <b><i>(\blep&#333;sin\)</i></b>, linear action "Jesus had kindled a<br>
 light within them. They must not hide it, but must see that it<br>
 spreads to others" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b>. The parable of the lamp throws<br>
 light on the parable of the sower.<br>
 <br>
 8:17 <B>{That shall not be known}</B> <b><i>(\ho ou m&#275; gn&#333;sth&#275;i\)</i></b>. Peculiar to<br>
 Luke. First aorist passive subjunctive of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\ with the<br>
 strong double negative \ou m&#275;\. See on &#175;Mr 4:22 for discussion<br>
 of \krupton\ and \apokruphon\.<br>
 <br>
 8:18 <B>{How ye hear}</B> <b><i>(\p&#333;s akouete\)</i></b>. The manner of hearing. <!-#-->Mr<br>
 4:24 has "what ye hear" <b><i>(\ti akouete\)</i></b>, the matter that is<br>
 heard. Both are supremely important. Some things should not be<br>
 heard at all. Some that are heard should be forgotten. Others<br>
 should be treasured and practised. <B>{For whosoever hath}</B> <b><i>(\Hos an<br>
 gar ech&#275;i\)</i></b>. Present active subjunctive of the common verb \ech&#333;\<br>
 which may mean "keep on having" or "acquiring." See on &#175;Mr 4:25<br>
 for discussion. <B>{Thinketh he hath}</B> <b><i>(\dokei echein\)</i></b>, or <B>{seems to<br>
 acquire or to hold}</B>. Losses in business illustrate this saying as<br>
 when we see their riches take wings and fly away. So it is with<br>
 hearing and heeding. Self-deception is a common complaint.<br>
 <br>
 8:19 <B>{His mother and brethren}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; m&#275;t&#275;r kai hoi adelphoi<br>
 autou\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr 3:31-35; Mt 12:46-50 place the visit of the mother<br>
 and brothers of Jesus before the parable of the sower. Usually<br>
 Luke follows Mark's order, but he does not do so here. At first<br>
 the brothers of Jesus <b><i>(younger sons of Joseph and Mary, I take<br>
 the words to mean, there being sisters also)</i></b> were not unfriendly<br>
 to the work of Jesus as seen in <!-#-->Joh 2:12 when they with the<br>
 mother of Jesus are with him and the small group <b><i>(half dozen)</i></b><br>
 disciples in Capernaum after the wedding in Cana. But as Jesus<br>
 went on with his work and was rejected at Nazareth <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu<br>
 4:16-31)</i></b>, there developed an evident disbelief in his claims on<br>
 the part of the brothers who ridiculed him six months before the<br>
 end <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 7:5)</i></b>. At this stage they have apparently come with<br>
 Mary to take Jesus home out of the excitement of the crowds,<br>
 perhaps thinking that he is beside himself <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 3:21)</i></b>. They<br>
 hardly believed the charge of the rabbis that Jesus was in league<br>
 with Beelzebub. Certainly the mother of Jesus could give no<br>
 credence to that slander. But she herself was deeply concerned<br>
 and wanted to help him if possible. See discussion of the problem<br>
 in my little book _The Mother of Jesus_ and also on &#175;Mr 3:31 and<br>
 &#175;Mt 12:46. <B>{Come to him}</B> <b><i>(\suntuchein\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 infinitive of \suntugchan&#333;\, an old verb, though here alone in<br>
 the N.T., meaning to meet with, to fall in with as if<br>
 accidentally, here with associative instrumental case \aut&#333;i\.<br>
 <br>
 8:20 <B>{Was told}</B> <b><i>(\ap&#275;ggel&#275;\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive indicative of<br>
 \apaggell&#333;\, to bring word or tidings. Common verb. See on &#175;Mr<br>
 3:32 and &#175;Mt 12:47 for details.<br>
 <br>
 8:21 <B>{These which hear the word of God and do it}</B> <b><i>(\hoi ton logon<br>
 tou theou akouontes kai poiountes\)</i></b>. The absence of the article<br>
 with "mother" and "brothers" probably means, as Plummer argues,<br>
 "Mother to me and brothers to me are those who &c." No one is a<br>
 child of God because of human parentage <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:13)</i></b>. "Family<br>
 ties are at best temporal; spiritual ties are eternal" <b><i>(Plummer)</i></b><br>
 . Note the use of "hear and do" together here as in <!-#-->Mt 7:24; Lu<br>
 6:47 at the close of the Sermon on the Mount. The parable of the<br>
 sower is almost like a footnote to that sermon. Later Jesus will<br>
 make "doing" a test of friendship for him <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 15:14)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:22 <B>{And they launched forth}</B> <b><i>(\kai an&#275;chth&#275;san\)</i></b>. First aorist<br>
 passive indicative of \anag&#333;\, an old verb, to lead up, to put<br>
 out to sea <b><i>(looked at as going up from the land)</i></b>. This nautical<br>
 sense of the verb occurs only in Luke in the N.T. and especially<br>
 in the Acts <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 13:13; 16:11; 18:21; 20:3,13; 21:I,2;<br>
 27:2,4,12,21; 28:10f.)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:23 <B>{He fell asleep}</B> <b><i>(\aphupn&#333;sen\)</i></b>. First aorist <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b><br>
 active indicative of \aphupno&#333;\, to put to sleep, to fall off to<br>
 sleep, a late verb for which the older Greek used \kathupno&#333;\.<br>
 Originally \aphupno&#333;\ meant to waken from sleep, then to fall off<br>
 to sleep <b><i>(possibly a medical use)</i></b>. This is the only passage which<br>
 speaks of the sleep of Jesus. Here only in the N.T. <B>{Came down}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\kateb&#275;\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative of \katabain&#333;\,<br>
 common verb. It was literally true. These wind storms <b><i>(\lailaps\.<br>
 So also <!-#-->Mr 4:37)</i></b> rushed from Hermon down through the Jordan<br>
 gorge upon the Sea of Galilee and shook it like a tempest <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt<br>
 8:24)</i></b>. Mark's <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 4:37)</i></b> vivid use of the dramatic present<br>
 \ginetai\ <b><i>(ariseth)</i></b> is not so precise as Luke's "came down." See<br>
 on &#175;Mt 8:24. These sudden squalls were dangerous on this small<br>
 lake. <B>{They were filling}</B> <b><i>(\sunepl&#275;rounto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive.<br>
 It was the boat that was being filled <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 4:37)</i></b> and it is here<br>
 applied to the navigators as sailors sometimes spoke. An old<br>
 verb, but in the N.T. used only by Luke <b><i>(<!-#-->8:23; 9:51; Ac 2:1)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Were in jeopardy}</B> <b><i>(\ekinduneuon\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, vivid<br>
 description. Old verb, but in the N.T. only here, <!-#-->Ac 19:27; 1Co<br>
 15:30.<br>
 <br>
 8:24 <B>{Master, Master}</B> <b><i>(\Epistata, epistata\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Lu 5:5 for<br>
 discussion. <!-#-->Mr 4:38 has <B>{Teacher}</B> <b><i>(\Didaskale\)</i></b>, <!-#-->Mt 8:25 has<br>
 <B>{Lord}</B> <b><i>(\Kurie\)</i></b>. The repetition here shows the uneasiness of the<br>
 disciples. <B>{We perish}</B> <b><i>(\apollumetha\)</i></b>. So in <!-#-->Mr 4:38; Mt 8:25.<br>
 Linear present middle indicative, we are perishing. <B>{The raging<br>
 of the water}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i kludoni tou hudatos\)</i></b>. \Klud&#333;n\, common Greek<br>
 word, is a boisterous surge, a violent agitation. Here only in<br>
 the N.T. save <!-#-->Jas 1:6. \Kuma\ <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 4:37)</i></b> is the regular swell<br>
 or wave. A <B>{calm}</B> <b><i>(\gal&#275;n&#275;\)</i></b>. Only in the parallels in the N.T.,<br>
 though common word. Here <!-#-->Mr 4:39; Mt 8:26 add <B>{great}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\megal&#275;\)</i></b>. <B>{That}</B> <b><i>(\hoti\)</i></b>. This use of \hoti\ as explanatory of<br>
 the demonstrative pronoun \houtos\ occurs in the parallels <!-#-->Mr<br>
 4:36; Mt 8:27 and also in <!-#-->Lu 4:36. It is almost result. <B>{He<br>
 commandeth}</B> <b><i>(\epitassei\)</i></b>. Peculiar to Luke.<br>
 <br>
 8:26 <B>{They arrived}</B> <b><i>(\katepleusan\)</i></b>. First aorist active<br>
 indicative of \kataple&#333;\, common verb, but here only in the N.T.<br>
 Literally, <B>{they sailed down}</B> from the sea to the land, the<br>
 opposite of <B>{launched forth}</B> <b><i>(\an&#275;chth&#275;san\)</i></b> of verse <!-#-->22. So we<br>
 today use like nautical terms, to bear up, to bear down. <B>{The<br>
 Gerasenes}</B> <b><i>(\ton Geras&#275;n&#333;n\)</i></b>. This is the correct text here as in<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 5:1 while Gadarenes is correct in <!-#-->Mt 8:28. See there for<br>
 explanation of this famous discrepancy, now cleared up by<br>
 Thomson's discovery of Khersa <b><i>(\Gersa\)</i></b> on the steep eastern bank<br>
 and in the vicinity of Gadara. <B>{Over against Galilee}</B> <b><i>(\antipera<br>
 t&#275;s Galilaias\)</i></b>. Only here in the N.T. The later Greek form is<br>
 \antiperan\ <b><i>(Polybius, etc.)</i></b>. Some MSS. here have \peran\ like<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 5:1; Mt 8:28.<br>
 <br>
 8:27 <B>{And for a long time}</B> <b><i>(\kai chron&#333;i hikan&#333;i\)</i></b>. The use of<br>
 the associative instrumental case in expressions of time is a<br>
 very old Greek idiom that still appears in the papyri <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, p. 527)</i></b>. <B>{He had worn no clothes}</B> <b><i>(\ouk enedusato<br>
 himation\)</i></b>. First aorist middle indicative, constative aorist,<br>
 viewing the "long time" as a point. Not pluperfect as English has<br>
 it and not for the pluperfect, simply "and for a long time he did<br>
 not put on himself <b><i>(indirect middle)</i></b> any clothing." The physician<br>
 would naturally note this item. Common verb \endu&#333;\ or \endun&#333;\.<br>
 This item in Luke alone, though implied by <!-#-->Mr 5:15 "clothed"<br>
 <b><i>(\himatismenon\)</i></b>. <B>{And abode not in any house}</B> <b><i>(\kai en oiki&#257;i<br>
 ouk emenen\)</i></b>. Imperfect active. Peculiar to Luke, though implied<br>
 by the mention of tombs in all three <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 5:3; Mt 8:28; Lu<br>
 8:27)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:28 <B>{Fell down}</B> <b><i>(\prosepesen\)</i></b>. Second aorist active of<br>
 \prospipt&#333;\, to fall forward, towards, prostrate before one as<br>
 here. Common verb. <!-#-->Mr 5:6 has \prosekun&#275;sen\ <b><i>(worshipped)</i></b>. <B>{The<br>
 Most High God}</B> <b><i>(\tou theou tou hupsistou\)</i></b>. Uncertain whether<br>
 \tou theou\ genuine or not. But "the Most High" clearly means God<br>
 as already seen <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 1:32,35,36; 6:35)</i></b>. The phrase is common<br>
 among heathen <b><i>(<!-#-->Nu 24:16; Mic 6:6; Isa 14:14)</i></b>. The demoniac may<br>
 have been a Gentile, but it is the demon here speaking. See on<br>
 &#175;Mr 2:7; Mt 8:29 for the Greek idiom <b><i>(\ti emoi kai soi\)</i></b>. "What<br>
 have I to do with thee?" See there also for "Torment me not."<br>
 <br>
 8:29 <B>{For he commanded}</B> <b><i>(\par&#275;ggellen gar\)</i></b>. Imperfect active,<br>
 correct text, for he was commanding. <B>{Often times}</B> <b><i>(\pollois<br>
 chronois\)</i></b>. Or "for a long time" like \chron&#333;i poll&#333;i\ of verse<br>
 <!-#-->27 <b><i>(see Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 537, for the plural here)</i></b>. <B>{It<br>
 had seized}</B> <b><i>(\sun&#275;rpakei\)</i></b>. Past perfect active of \sunarpaz&#333;\,<br>
 to lay hold by force. An old verb, but only in Luke in the N.T.<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:29; Ac 6:12; 19:29; 27:15)</i></b>. <B>{Was kept under guard}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\edesmeueto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive of \desmeu&#333;\ to put in chains,<br>
 from \desmos\, bond, and that from \de&#333;\ to bind. Old, but rather<br>
 rare verb. Only here and <!-#-->Ac 22:4 in this sense. In <!-#-->Mt 23:4 it<br>
 means to bind together. Some MSS. read \desme&#333;\ in <!-#-->Lu 8:29.<br>
 <B>{Breaking the bands asunder}</B> <b><i>(\diar&#275;ss&#333;n ta desma\)</i></b>. Old verb,<br>
 the preposition \dia\ <b><i>(in two)</i></b> intensifying the meaning of the<br>
 simple verb \r&#275;ss&#333;\ or \r&#275;gnumi\, to rend. <B>{Was driven}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\&#275;launeto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive of \elaun&#333;\, to drive, to row, to<br>
 march <b><i>(Xenophon)</i></b>. Only five times in the N.T. Here alone in Luke<br>
 and peculiar to Luke in this incident.<br>
 <br>
 8:30 <B>{Legion}</B> <b><i>(\Legi&#333;n\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Mr 5:9.<br>
 <br>
 8:31 <B>{Into the abyss}</B> <b><i>(\eis t&#275;n abusson\)</i></b>. Rare old word common<br>
 in LXX from \a\ privative and \bath&#8211;s\ <b><i>(deep)</i></b>. So bottomless<br>
 place <b><i>(supply \ch&#333;ra\)</i></b>. The deep sea in <!-#-->Ge 1:2; 7:11. The<br>
 common receptacle of the dead in <!-#-->Ro 10:7 and especially the<br>
 abode of demons as here and <!-#-->Re 9:1-11; 11:7; 17:8; 20:1,3.<br>
 <br>
 8:32 <B>{A herd of many swine}</B> <b><i>(\agel&#275; choir&#333;n hikan&#333;n\)</i></b>. Word<br>
 <B>{herd}</B> <b><i>(\agel&#275;\)</i></b> old as Homer, but in N.T. only here and<br>
 parallels <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 5:11; Mt 8:30)</i></b>. Luke shows his fondness for<br>
 adjective \hikanos\ here again <b><i>(see verse <!-#-->27)</i></b> where Mark has<br>
 \megal&#275;\ and Matthew \poll&#333;n\.<br>
 <br>
 8:33 <B>{Rushed down the steep}</B> <b><i>(\h&#333;rm&#275;sen kata tou kr&#275;mnou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Ablative with \kata\ as in <!-#-->Mr 5:13; Mt 8:32 and the same vivid<br>
 verb in each account, to hurl impetuously, to rush. <B>{Were choked}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\apepnig&#275;\)</i></b>. Second aorist <b><i>(constative)</i></b> passive indicative third<br>
 singular <b><i>(collective singular)</i></b> where <!-#-->Mr 5:13 has the<br>
 picturesque imperfect \epnigonto\.<br>
 <br>
 8:34 <B>{Saw what had come to pass}</B> <b><i>(\idontes to gegonos\)</i></b>. This<br>
 item only in Luke. Note the neat Greek idiom \to gegonos\,<br>
 articular second perfect active participle of \ginomai\. Repeated<br>
 in verse <!-#-->35 and in <!-#-->Mr 5:14. Note numerous participles here in<br>
 verse <!-#-->35 as in <!-#-->Mr 5:15.<br>
 <br>
 8:36 <B>{He that was possessed with devils <b><i>(demons)</i></b>}</B> <b><i>(only two words<br>
 in Greek, \ho daimonistheis\, the demonized)</i></b>. <B>{Was made whole}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\es&#333;th&#275;\)</i></b>. First aorist passive indicative of \s&#333;z&#333;\ to save<br>
 from \s&#333;s\ <b><i>(safe and sound)</i></b>. This is additional information to<br>
 the news carried to them in verse <!-#-->34.<br>
 <br>
 8:37 <B>{Were holden with great fear}</B> <b><i>(\phob&#333;i megal&#333;i<br>
 suneichonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive of \sunech&#333;\ with the<br>
 instrumental case of \phobos\. See a similar use of this vigorous<br>
 verb in <!-#-->Lu 12:50 of Jesus and in <!-#-->Php 1:23 of Paul.<br>
 <br>
 8:38 <B>{From whom the devils <b><i>(demons)</i></b> were gone out}</B> <b><i>(\aph' hou<br>
 exel&#275;luthei ta daimonia\)</i></b>. Past perfect active of \exerchomai\,<br>
 state of completion in the past. <B>{Prayed him}</B> <b><i>(\edeeito autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect middle, kept on begging.<br>
 <br>
 8:39 <B>{Throughout the whole city}</B> <b><i>(\kath' hol&#275;n t&#275;n polin\)</i></b>. <!-#-->Mr<br>
 5:20 has it "in Decapolis." He had a great story to tell and he<br>
 told it with power. The rescue missions in our cities can match<br>
 this incident with cases of great sinners who have made witnesses<br>
 for Christ.<br>
 <br>
 8:40 <B>{Welcomed}</B> <b><i>(\apedexato\)</i></b>. Peculiar to Luke. To receive with<br>
 pleasure, from \apodechomai\, a common verb. <B>{For they were all<br>
 waiting for him}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;san gar pantes prosdok&#333;ntes auton\)</i></b>.<br>
 Periphrastic imperfect active of <B>{prosdoka&#333;}</B>, an old verb for<br>
 eager expectancy, a vivid picture of the attitude of the people<br>
 towards Jesus. Driven from Decapolis, he is welcomed in<br>
 Capernaum.<br>
 <br>
 8:41 <B>{Was}</B> <b><i>(\hup&#275;rchen\)</i></b>. Imperfect of \huparch&#333;\ in sense of<br>
 \&#275;n\ as in modern Greek. Common in Luke, and Acts, but not in<br>
 other Gospels.<br>
 <br>
 8:42 <B>{An only daughter}</B> <b><i>(\thugat&#275;r monogen&#275;s\)</i></b>. The same<br>
 adjective used of the widow's son <b><i>(<!-#-->7:12)</i></b> and the epileptic boy<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->9:38)</i></b> and of Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 1:18; 3:16)</i></b>. <B>{She lay a dying}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\apethn&#275;sken\)</i></b>. Imperfect active, she was dying. <!-#-->Mt 9:18 has<br>
 it that she has just died. <B>{Thronged}</B> <b><i>(\sunepnigon\)</i></b>. Imperfect<br>
 active of \sumpnig&#333;\, to press together, the verb used of the<br>
 thorns choking the growing grain <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:14)</i></b>. It was a jam.<br>
 <br>
 8:43 <B>{Had spent all her living upon physicians}</B> <b><i>(\eis iatrous<br>
 prosanal&#333;sasa holon ton bion\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle of<br>
 an old verb \prosanalisk&#333;\, only here in the N.T. But Westcott<br>
 and Hort reject this clause because it is not in B D Syriac<br>
 Sinaitic. Whether genuine or not, the other clause in <!-#-->Mr 5:26<br>
 certainly is not in Luke: "had suffered many things of many<br>
 physicians." Probably both are not genuine in Luke who takes care<br>
 of the physicians by the simple statement that it was a chronic<br>
 case: <B>{could not be healed of any}</B> <b><i>(\ouk ischusen ap' oudenos<br>
 therapeuth&#275;nai\)</i></b>. He omitted also what Mark has: "and was nothing<br>
 bettered but rather grew worse."<br>
 <br>
 8:44 <B>{The border of his garment}</B> <b><i>(\tou kraspedou tou himatiou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Probably the tassel of the overgarment. Of the four corners two<br>
 were in front and two behind. See on &#175;Mt 9:20. <B>{Stanched}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\est&#275;\)</i></b>. Second aorist active indicative, <B>{stopped}</B> at once<br>
 <b><i>(effective aorist)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:45 <B>{Press thee and crush thee}</B> <b><i>(\sunechousin se kai<br>
 apothlibousin\)</i></b>. Hold thee together, hold thee in <b><i>(\sunech&#333;\, see<br>
 verse <!-#-->37)</i></b>. <B>{Crush thee}</B> <b><i>(\apothlib&#333;\)</i></b> here only in the N.T., a<br>
 verb used of pressing out grapes in Diodorus and Josephus. <!-#-->Mr<br>
 5:31 has \sunthlib&#333;\, to press together.<br>
 <br>
 8:46 <B>{For I perceived that power had gone forth from me}</B> <b><i>(\eg&#333;<br>
 gar egn&#333;n dunamin exel&#275;luthuian ap' emou\)</i></b>. \Egn&#333;n\ is second<br>
 aorist active indicative of \gin&#333;sk&#333;\, knowledge by personal<br>
 experience as here. It is followed by the second perfect active<br>
 participle \exel&#275;luthuian\ in indirect discourse <b><i>(Robertson,<br>
 _Grammar_, pp. 1040-42)</i></b>. Jesus felt the sensation of power<br>
 already gone. Who does not know what this sense of "goneness" or<br>
 exhaustion of nervous energy means?<br>
 <br>
 8:47 <B>{Trembling}</B> <b><i>(\tremousa\)</i></b>. Vivid touch of the feeling of this<br>
 sensitive woman who now had to tell everybody of her cure, "in<br>
 the presence of all the people" <b><i>(\en&#333;pion pantos tou laou\)</i></b>. She<br>
 faced the widest publicity for her secret cure.<br>
 <br>
 8:49 <B>{From the ruler of the synagogue's house}</B> <b><i>(\para tou<br>
 archisunag&#333;gou\)</i></b>. The word "house" is not in the Greek here as in<br>
 <!-#-->Mr 5:35 where \apo\ is used rather than \para\, as here. But<br>
 the ruler himself had come to Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Lu 8:41)</i></b> and this is the<br>
 real idea. Trouble not <b><i>(\m&#275;keti skulle\)</i></b>. See on &#175;Lu 7:6 for<br>
 this verb and also <!-#-->Mr 5:35; Mt 9:36.<br>
 <br>
 8:50 <B>{And she shall be made whole}</B> <b><i>(\kai s&#333;th&#275;setai\)</i></b>. This<br>
 promise in addition to the words in <!-#-->Mr 5:36. See there for<br>
 discussion of details.<br>
 <br>
 8:53 <B>{Knowing that she was dead}</B> <b><i>(\eidotes hoti apethanen\)</i></b>. That<br>
 she died <b><i>(\apethanen\)</i></b>, second aorist active indicative of<br>
 \apothn&#275;sk&#333;\.<br>
 <br>
 8:54 <B>{Called}</B> <b><i>(\eph&#333;n&#275;sen\)</i></b>. Certainly not to wake up the dead,<br>
 but to make it plain to all that she rose in response to his<br>
 elevated tone of voice. Some think that the remark of Jesus in<br>
 verse <!-#-->52 <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 5:39; Mt 9:24)</i></b> proves that she was not really<br>
 dead, but only in a trance. It matters little. The touch of<br>
 Christ's hand and the power of his voice restored her to life.<br>
 <B>{Maiden}</B> <b><i>(\h&#275; pais\)</i></b> rather than Mark's <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 5:41)</i></b> \to korasion\<br>
 <b><i>(vernacular _Koin&#275;_)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 8:55 <B>{Her spirit returned}</B> <b><i>(\epestrepsen to pneuma aut&#275;s\)</i></b>. The<br>
 life came back to her at once. <B>{Be given her to eat}</B> <b><i>(\aut&#275;i<br>
 doth&#275;nai phagein\)</i></b>. The first infinitive \doth&#275;nai\ is an<br>
 indirect command. The second \phagein\ <b><i>(second aorist active of<br>
 \esthi&#333;\)</i></b> is epexegetic purpose.<br>
