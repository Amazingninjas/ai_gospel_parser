<p>28:1 <B>{Then we knew}</B> <b><i>(\tote epegn&#333;men\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 <b><i>(ingressive)</i></b> active indicative of \epigin&#333;sk&#333;\. Then we<br>
 recognized. See <!-#-->27:39. <B>{Was called}</B> <b><i>(\kaleitai\)</i></b>. Present<br>
 passive indicative retained in indirect discourse. <B>{Melita}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\Melit&#275;\)</i></b>. Not \Mileten&#275;\ as only B reads, a clerical error, but<br>
 retained in the text of Westcott and Hort because of B. Page<br>
 notes that the island was Malta as is shown from the name, the<br>
 location, the presence of a ship from Alexandria bound for Rome<br>
 wintering there <b><i>(verse <!-#-->11)</i></b>, and the mention of Syracuse as the<br>
 next stop after leaving <b><i>(verse <!-#-->12)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 28:2 <B>{The barbarians}</B> <b><i>(\hoi barbaroi\)</i></b>. The Greeks called all men<br>
 "barbarians" who did not speak Greek <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 1:14)</i></b>, not<br>
 "barbarians" in our sense of rude and uncivilized, but simply<br>
 "foreign folk." Diodorus Siculus <b><i>(V. 12)</i></b> says that it was a<br>
 colony of the Phoenicians and so their language was Punic <b><i>(Page)</i></b>.<br>
 The word originally meant an uncouth repetition <b><i>(\barbar\)</i></b> not<br>
 understood by others <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 14:11)</i></b>. In <!-#-->Col 3:11 Paul couples it<br>
 with Scythian as certainly not Christian. These are <b><i>(with verse<br>
 <!-#-->4 below)</i></b> the only N.T. instances. <B>{Showed us}</B> <b><i>(\pareichan\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active of \parech&#333;\ with \-an\ instead of \-on\ as<br>
 \eichan\ in <!-#-->Mr 8:7 <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 339)</i></b>. It was their<br>
 habit on this occasion, Luke means, they kept on showing. <B>{No<br>
 common kindness}</B> <b><i>(\ou t&#275;n tuchousan philanthr&#333;pian\)</i></b>. The old<br>
 word \philanthr&#333;pia\ <b><i>(\philos\, \anthr&#333;pos\)</i></b>, love of mankind,<br>
 occurs in the N.T. only here and <!-#-->Tit 3:4 <b><i>(adverb in <!-#-->27:3)</i></b>.<br>
 See on &#175;19:11 for this use of \ou t&#275;n tuchousan\, "not the<br>
 kindness that happens every day." They were not "wreckers" to<br>
 take advantage of the calamity. <B>{They kindled a fire}</B> <b><i>(\hapsantes<br>
 puran\)</i></b>. The only N.T. example and verse <!-#-->3 of the old word<br>
 \pura\ <b><i>(from \pur\, fire)</i></b>, a pile of burning fuel <b><i>(sticks)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active participle of \hapt&#333;\, to set fire to, to kindle.<br>
 Cf. \anapt&#333;\ in <!-#-->Lu 12:49. <B>{Received us all}</B> <b><i>(\proselabonto<br>
 pantas h&#275;m&#257;s\)</i></b>. Second aorist middle <b><i>(indirect indicative of<br>
\proslamban&#333;\.)</i></b> They took us all to themselves <b><i>(cf. 
<!-#-->
Ac 18:26)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{The present}</B> <b><i>(\ton ephest&#333;ta\)</i></b>. Second perfect active participle<br>
 <b><i>(intransitive)</i></b> of \ephist&#275;mi\, "the rain that stood upon them"<br>
 <b><i>(the pouring rain)</i></b>. Only in Luke and Paul in N.T.<br>
 <br>
 28:3 <B>{When Paul had gathered}</B> <b><i>(\sustrepsantos tou Paulou\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute with first aorist active participle of<br>
 \sustreph&#333;\, old verb to twist or turn together or roll into a<br>
 bundle. In N.T. only here and <!-#-->Mt 17:22. <B>{A bundle of sticks}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\phrugan&#333;n ti pl&#275;thos\)</i></b>. "Some multitude <b><i>(or pile)</i></b> of dry twigs"<br>
 <b><i>(\phrugan&#333;n\ from \phrug&#333;\ or \phruss&#333;\, to dry. Only here in<br>
 N.T.)</i></b>. <B>{Laid}</B> <b><i>(\epithentos\)</i></b>. So genitive absolute again with<br>
 second aorist active participle of \epitith&#275;mi\, to place upon.<br>
 Few things show Paul to better advantage than this incident. <B>{By<br>
 reason of the heat}</B> <b><i>(\apo t&#275;s therm&#275;s\)</i></b>. Old word, only here in<br>
 N.T. Ablative case with \apo\ <b><i>(from the heat)</i></b>. The viper was in a<br>
 state of torpor in the bundle of sticks. The heat wakened him. <B>{A<br>
 viper}</B> <b><i>(\echidna\)</i></b>. The old word used by the Baptist of the<br>
 Pharisees <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 3:7; Lu 3:7)</i></b> and by Jesus also <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 12:34;<br>
 23:33)</i></b>. It is objected that there is little wood in the island<br>
 today and no vipers, though Lewin as late as 1853 believes that<br>
 he saw a viper near St. Paul's Bay. But the island now has 1,200<br>
 people to the square mile and snakes of any kind have a poor<br>
 chance. The viper has also disappeared from Arran as the island<br>
 became more frequented <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. Ramsay thinks that the small<br>
 constrictor <b><i>(_Coronella Austriaca_)</i></b> which still exists in the<br>
 island may be the "viper," though it has no poison fangs, but<br>
 clings and bites. The natives thought that it was a poisonous<br>
 viper. <B>{Fastened on his hand}</B> <b><i>(\kath&#275;pse t&#275;s cheiros autou\)</i></b>.<br>
 First aorist active indicative of \kathapt&#333;\, to fasten down on<br>
 with the genitive case. Old verb, here only in N.T. Cf. <!-#-->Mr<br>
 16:18.<br>
 <br>
 28:4 <B>{The beast}</B> <b><i>(\to th&#275;rion\)</i></b>. Diminutive of \th&#275;r\ and so<br>
 little beast. See on &#175;Mr 1:13. Aristotle and the medical writers<br>
 apply the word to venomous serpents, the viper in particular<br>
 <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>, as Luke does here. Vincent calls attention to the<br>
 curious history of our word "_treacle_" for molasses <b><i>(Latin<br>
 _theriaca_)</i></b> from \th&#275;riak&#275;\, an antidote made from the flesh of<br>
 vipers. Coverdale translates <!-#-->Jer 8:22: "There is no more<br>
 treacle in Gilead." Jeremy Taylor: "We kill the viper and make<br>
 treacle of him." <B>{Hanging from his hand}</B> <b><i>(\kremamenon ek t&#275;s<br>
 cheiros autou\)</i></b>. Vivid picture of the snake dangling from Paul's<br>
 hand. Present middle participle of \kremamai\, late form for<br>
 \kremannumi\, to hang up, to suspend <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Ga 3:13)</i></b>. <B>{No doubt}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\pant&#333;s\)</i></b>. Literally, By all means, old adverb. Cf. <!-#-->21:22; Lu<br>
 4:23; 1Co 9:22. Only by Luke and Paul in the N.T. "They _knew_<br>
 that he was a prisoner being taken to Rome on some grave charge,<br>
 and _inferred_ that the charge was murder" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. <B>{Though he<br>
 hath escaped}</B> <b><i>(\dias&#333;thenta\)</i></b>. First aorist passive participle of<br>
 \dias&#333;z&#333;\ <b><i>(same verb used in <!-#-->24:43,44; 28:1)</i></b>, so-called<br>
 concessive use of the participle <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 1129)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{Yet Justice}</B> <b><i>(\dik&#275;\)</i></b>. An abstraction personified like the Latin<br>
 _Justitia_ <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. The natives speak of \Dik&#275;\ as a goddess, but<br>
 we know nothing of such actual worship in Malta, though the<br>
 Greeks worshipped abstractions as in Athens. <B>{Hath not suffered}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ouk eiasen\)</i></b>. Did not suffer. They look on Paul as a doomed man<br>
 as good as dead. These people thought that calamity was proof of<br>
 guilt, poor philosophy and worse theology.<br>
 <br>
 28:5 <B>{Shook off}</B> <b><i>(\apotinaxas\)</i></b>. First aorist active participle<br>
 of \apotinass&#333;\, to shake off. Rare word <b><i>(Euripides, Galen, LXX)</i></b>.<br>
 In N.T. only here and <!-#-->Lu 9:5.<br>
 <br>
 28:6 <B>{But they expected}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de prosedok&#333;n\)</i></b>. Imperfect active,<br>
 were expecting, continued to expect. <B>{That he would have swollen}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\auton mellein pimprasthai\)</i></b>. More exactly, "Expecting him to be<br>
 about <b><i>(or that he was about)</i></b> to swell up." \Pimprasthai\ is<br>
 present middle infinitive from \pimpr&#275;mi\, to blow, to burn, to<br>
 inflame, to cause to swell. \Pr&#275;th&#333;\, to swell, seems connected<br>
 and both use the aorist \epr&#275;sa\. Our word "inflammation"<br>
 likewise means a burning and a swelling. This verb is a common<br>
 medical term used as Luke has it. It occurs here only in N.T. <B>{Or<br>
 fallen down dead suddenly}</B> <b><i>(\&#275; katapiptein aphn&#333; nekron\)</i></b>.<br>
 Rather, "or was about to fall down dead suddenly." The two common<br>
 results of a bite by a viper or other poisonous snake, both<br>
 medical terms used by Luke. <B>{But when they were long in<br>
 expectation}</B> <b><i>(\epi polu de aut&#333;n prosdok&#333;nt&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute. "But while they were expecting for much time." <B>{Nothing<br>
 amiss come to him}</B> <b><i>(\m&#275;den atopon eis auton ginomenon\)</i></b>. "Nothing<br>
 out of place coming to him" <b><i>(present middle participle)</i></b>. \M&#275;den\<br>
 the usual negative of the participle and the accusative case the<br>
 object of \the&#333;rount&#333;n\ <b><i>(genitive absolute)</i></b>. <B>{Changed their<br>
 minds}</B> <b><i>(\metabalomenoi\)</i></b>. Aorist middle <b><i>(direct)</i></b> participle of<br>
 \metaball&#333;\, old verb to turn about or around, turning themselves<br>
 about, changing their minds. Plato uses this very verb in middle<br>
 voice for changing the mind. <B>{That he was a god}</B> <b><i>(\auton einai<br>
 theon\)</i></b>. Accusative and infinitive in indirect discourse. At<br>
 Lystra Paul was first received as a god <b><i>(Mercury)</i></b> and then they<br>
 stoned him to kill him <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 14:11,19)</i></b>. So fickle is popular<br>
 favour.<br>
 <br>
 28:7 <B>{To the chief man of the island}</B> <b><i>(\t&#333;i pr&#333;t&#333;i t&#275;s n&#275;sou\)</i></b>.<br>
 An official title correct in Malta <b><i>(Ramsay, _St. Paul_, p. 343)</i></b>.<br>
 An inscription in Malta calls Prudens "Primate of the Maltese"<br>
 <b><i>(\pr&#333;tos Melitai&#333;n\)</i></b>. Here it is plainly a title and not the<br>
 common use seen in <!-#-->13:50; 25:2; 28:17. <B>{Publius}</B> <b><i>(\Popli&#333;i\)</i></b>.<br>
 This Greek name <b><i>(\praenomen\)</i></b> can be derived either from<br>
 \Popilius\ or \Publius\ <b><i>(cf. \publicus\ for \populicus\ from<br>
 \populus\)</i></b>. Entertained us <b><i>(\exenisen h&#275;m&#257;s\)</i></b>. Paul and his<br>
 companions <b><i>(Luke and Aristarchus)</i></b>. Was Julius included? On<br>
 \xeniz&#333;\ see <!-#-->Ac 10:23. <B>{Courteously}</B> <b><i>(\philophron&#333;s\)</i></b>. This old<br>
 adverb from \philophr&#333;n\ <b><i>(\philos, phren\, friendly mind)</i></b> occurs<br>
 here alone in the N.T. In a kindly or friendly manner, all the<br>
 more so because of the original suspicion of Paul as a criminal.<br>
 <br>
 28:8 <B>{Lay}</B> <b><i>(\katakeisthai\)</i></b>. Common verb for the sick <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr 1:30;<br>
 Joh 5:6)</i></b>. <B>{Sick}</B> <b><i>(\sunechomenon\)</i></b>. "Held together." Common verb<br>
 again for the sick as in <!-#-->Lu 4:38. <B>{Of fever}</B> <b><i>(\puretois\)</i></b>.<br>
 Instrumental case, and plural "fevers," medical term for<br>
 intermittent attacks of fever <b><i>(Demosthenes, Lucian, medical<br>
 writers)</i></b>. <B>{Dysentery}</B> <b><i>(\dusenteri&#333;i\)</i></b>. Instrumental case also.<br>
 Late form of the older \dusenteria\ and only here in N.T. Our<br>
 very word _dysentery_. Another medical term of which Luke uses so<br>
 many. Hippocrates often mentions these two diseases together.<br>
 <B>{Laying his hands on him healed him}</B> <b><i>(\epitheis tas cheiras aut&#333;i<br>
 iasato auton\)</i></b>. Either like the laying on of hands in <!-#-->Jas 5:14,<br>
 the gift of healing <b><i>(<!-#-->1Co 12:9f.)</i></b>, or the tender interest of<br>
 Jesus when he took hold of the hand of Peter's mother-in-law <b><i>(<!-#-->Mr<br>
 1:31)</i></b>. Ramsay argues that \iaomai\ is employed here of the<br>
 miraculous healing by Paul while \therapeu&#333;\ is used of the cures<br>
 by Luke the physician <b><i>(verse <!-#-->9)</i></b>. This is a general distinction<br>
 and it is probably observed here, but in <!-#-->Lu 6:18 <b><i>(which see)</i></b><br>
 both verbs are employed of the healings by Jesus. <B>{Came and were<br>
 healed}</B> <b><i>(\pros&#275;rchonto kai etherapeuonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle and<br>
 imperfect passive. A regular stream of patients came during these<br>
 months. Luke had his share in the honours, "us" <b><i>(\h&#275;m&#257;s\)</i></b>, and no<br>
 doubt his share in the cures. <B>{With many honours}</B> <b><i>(\pollais<br>
 timais\)</i></b>. Instrumental case. The word was often applied to<br>
 payment for professional services as we today speak of an<br>
 honorarium. <B>{They put on board}</B> <b><i>(\epethento\)</i></b>. Second aorist<br>
 middle indicative of \epitith&#275;mi\, to put on. The idea of "on<br>
 board" is merely suggested by \anagomenois\ <b><i>(when we sailed)</i></b> "the<br>
 things for our needs" <b><i>(\ta pros tas chreias\)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 28:11 <B>{Which had wintered}</B> <b><i>(\parakecheimakoti\)</i></b>. Perfect active<br>
 participle of \paracheimaz&#333;\, to pass the winter. Old verb, in<br>
 N.T. only <!-#-->27:12; 28:11; 1Co 16:6; Tit 3:12. The locative case<br>
 agreeing with \ploi&#333;i\. Navigation in the Mediterranean usually<br>
 opened up in February <b><i>(always by March)</i></b>, spring beginning on Feb.<br>
 9 <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. <B>{Whose sign was the Twin Brothers}</B> <b><i>(\paras&#275;m&#333;i<br>
 Dioskourois\)</i></b>. The word \paras&#275;m&#333;i\ can be either a substantive<br>
 <b><i>(as Revised Version has it)</i></b> or an adjective "marked by the sign,"<br>
 examples of both uses common in ancient Greek. \Dioskourois\ is<br>
 in apposition with \paras&#275;m&#333;i\. The word means the twin sons<br>
 <b><i>(\kouros\ or \koros\)</i></b> of Zeus <b><i>(\Dios\, genitive of \Zeus\)</i></b> and<br>
 Leda, viz., Castor and Pollux. The Attic used the dual, \t&#333;<br>
 Dioskor&#333;\. Castor and Pollux were the tutelary deities of sailors<br>
 whose figures were painted one on each side of the prow of the<br>
 ship. This sign was the name of the ship. So they start in<br>
 another grain ship of Alexandria bound for Rome.<br>
 <br>
 28:12 <B>{Touching}</B> <b><i>(\katachthentes\)</i></b>. First aorist passive<br>
 participle of \katag&#333;\, to go down to land, just the opposite of<br>
 \an&#275;chth&#275;men\ in verse <!-#-->11 from \anag&#333;\, to go up to sea. <B>{At<br>
 Syracuse}</B> <b><i>(\eis Surakousas\)</i></b>. The chief city of Sicily and eighty<br>
 miles from Malta. Perhaps open weather and a southerly wind<br>
 helped them across. Here it was that Alcibiades wrecked the power<br>
 and glory of Athens. Why the ship spent three days we do not<br>
 know.<br>
 <br>
 28:13 <B>{We made a circuit}</B> <b><i>(\perielthontes\)</i></b>. Second aorist active<br>
 of \perierchomai\, to go around, old verb, already in <!-#-->19:13.<br>
 See also <!-#-->Heb 11:37; 1Ti 5:13. But Westcott and Hort read<br>
 \perielontes\ after Aleph B <b><i>(from \periaire&#333;\)</i></b> as in <!-#-->27:40,<br>
 though here it could only mean casting loose, for which no other<br>
 authority exists. At any rate the ship had to tack to reach<br>
 Rhegium and was not able to make a straight course<br>
 <b><i>(\enthudrome&#333;\, <!-#-->16:11)</i></b>. <B>{Rhegium}</B> <b><i>(\Rh&#275;gion\)</i></b> is from<br>
 \rh&#275;gnumi\, to break off, the place where the land breaks off,<br>
 the southern entrance to the straits of Messina. <B>{A south wind<br>
 sprang up}</B> <b><i>(\epigenomenou notou\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again, and<br>
 for all the world like that fatal south wind in <!-#-->27:13, but with<br>
 no bad results this time, though the weather was plainly<br>
 treacherous at this early season. <B>{On the second day}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\deuteraioi\)</i></b>. This is the classical use of the predicate<br>
 adjective, "We second day men" as in <!-#-->Lu 24:22; Joh 11:39; Php<br>
 3:5 instead of the adverb <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 657)</i></b>. <B>{To<br>
 Puteoli}</B> <b><i>(\eis Potiolous\)</i></b>. It was 182 miles from Rhegium and<br>
 would require 26 hours <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. It was eight miles northwest from<br>
 Neapolis <b><i>(Naples)</i></b> and the chief port of Rome, the regular harbour<br>
 for the Alexandrian ships from Rome. Portions of the great mole<br>
 are said to be still visible.<br>
 <br>
 28:14 <B>{Where we found brethren}</B> <b><i>(\hou heurontes adelphous\)</i></b>.<br>
 Possibly from Alexandria, but, as Blass observes, it is no more<br>
 strange to find "brethren" in Christ in Puteoli when Paul arrives<br>
 than in Rome. There was a large Jewish quarter. <B>{Seven days}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\h&#275;meras hepta\)</i></b>. Accusative of extent of time. Paul and his<br>
 party remained so long at the urgent request of the brethren. He<br>
 was still a prisoner, but clearly Julius was only too glad to<br>
 show another courtesy to Paul to whom they all owed their lives.<br>
 It was 130 miles by land from Puteoli to Rome over one of the<br>
 great Roman roads. <B>{And so we came to Rome}</B> <b><i>(\kai hout&#333;s eis t&#275;n<br>
 Rom&#275;n &#275;lthamen\)</i></b>. So at last. Luke is exultant as Page observes:<br>
 _Paulus Romae captivus: triumphus unicus_. It is the climax of<br>
 the book of Acts <b><i>(<!-#-->19:21; 23:11)</i></b>, but not the close of Paul's<br>
 career. Page rightly remarks that a new paragraph should begin<br>
 with verse <!-#-->15, for brethren came from Rome and this part of the<br>
 journey is touched with the flavour of that incident. The great<br>
 event is that Paul reached Rome, but not as he had once hoped<br>
 <b><i>(<!-#-->Ro 15:22-29)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 28:15 <B>{When they heard of us}</B> <b><i>(\akousantes ta peri h&#275;m&#333;n\)</i></b>. How<br>
 "they heard the things concerning us" we do not know. Good news<br>
 had its way of travel even before the days of telegraph,<br>
 telephone, daily papers. Possibly Julius had to send on special<br>
 couriers with news of his arrival after the shipwreck. Possibly<br>
 some of the brethren in Puteoli at once <b><i>(beginning of the week)</i></b><br>
 sent on news to the brethren in Rome. The church in Rome had long<br>
 ago received Paul's letter from Corinth at the hands of Phoebe.<br>
 <B>{To meet us}</B> <b><i>(\eis apant&#275;sin h&#275;min\)</i></b>. Idiomatic phrase, "for<br>
 meeting with us" <b><i>(associative instrumental case)</i></b>. _Koin&#275;_ word<br>
 \apant&#275;sis\ from verb \apanta&#333;\, to meet, in N.T. only here; <!-#-->Mt<br>
 25:6; 1Ti 4:17. Use after \eis\ rather than infinitive like a<br>
 translation Hebraism <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 91)</i></b>. <B>{As far as<br>
 the Market of Appius}</B> <b><i>(\achri Appiou Phorou\)</i></b>. The Forum of<br>
 Appius, 90 miles from Puteoli, 40 from Rome, on the great Appian<br>
 Way. The Censor Appius Claudius had constructed this part of the<br>
 road, B.C. 312. Paul probably struck the Appian Way at Capua.<br>
 Portions of this great stone highway are still in use. If one<br>
 wishes to tread where Paul trod, he can do it here. Appii Forum<br>
 had a bad reputation, the haunt of thieves, thugs, and swindlers.<br>
 What would this motley crowd think of Paul chained to a soldier?<br>
 <B>{Three Taverns}</B> <b><i>(\Tri&#333;n Tabern&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive case after \achri\<br>
 like \Appiou Phorou\. About 30 miles from Rome. _Tres Tabernae_.<br>
 <B>{Whom}</B> <b><i>(\hous\)</i></b>. Two groups of the disciples came <b><i>(one Gentile,<br>
 one Jewish, Rackham thinks)</i></b>, one to Appii Forum, the other to<br>
 Three Taverns. It was a joyous time and Julius would not<br>
 interfere. <B>{Took courage}</B> <b><i>(\elabe tharsos\)</i></b>. The old substantive<br>
 \tharsos\ is here alone in the N.T. Jesus himself had exhorted<br>
 Paul to be of good courage <b><i>(\tharsei\ <!-#-->Ac 23:11)</i></b> as he had done<br>
 the disciples <b><i>(<!-#-->Joh 16:33)</i></b>. Paul had passed through enough to<br>
 cause depression, whether he was depressed or not, but he deeply<br>
 appreciated this kindly sympathy.<br>
 <br>
 28:16 <B>{Paul was suffered to abide by himself}</B> <b><i>(\epetrap&#275; t&#333;i<br>
 Paul&#333;i menein kath' heauton\)</i></b>. Second aorist passive of<br>
 \epitrepo\, to permit or allow. Literally, "It was permitted to<br>
 Paul to abide by himself." Some late documents <b><i>(Textus Receptus)</i></b><br>
 here add: "The centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain<br>
 of the guard" <b><i>(or the \stratopedarch\)</i></b>. This officer used to be<br>
 considered Burrus who was Prefect of the Praetorian Guard A.D.<br>
 51-62. But it is by no means certain that Julius turned the<br>
 prisoners over to this officer. It seems more likely that Julius<br>
 would report to the captain of the Peregrini. If so, we may be<br>
 sure that Julius would give a good report of Paul to this officer<br>
 who would be kindly disposed and would allow Paul comparative<br>
 freedom <b><i>(living by himself, in his lodging, verse <!-#-->23, his own<br>
 hired house verse <!-#-->30, though still chained to a soldier)</i></b>. <B>{With<br>
 the soldier that guarded him}</B> <b><i>(\sun t&#333;i phulassonti auton<br>
 strati&#333;t&#275;i\)</i></b>. Probably a new soldier every day or night, but<br>
 always with this soldier chained to his right hand day and night.<br>
 Now that Paul is in Rome what can he do for Christ while he<br>
 awaits the outcome of his own appeal to Nero?<br>
 <br>
 28:17 <B>{Those that were the chief of the Jews}</B> <b><i>(\tous ontas t&#333;n<br>
 Ioudai&#333;n pr&#333;tous\)</i></b>. This use of \pr&#333;tos\ for the leading men of a<br>
 city or among the Jews we have already had in <!-#-->13:50; 25:2; Lu<br>
 19:47. Literally, "Those that were first among the Jews." The<br>
 position of the participle \ontas\ between the article and the<br>
 adjective \pr&#333;tous\ is regular <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 777)</i></b>.<br>
 <B>{When they were come together}</B> <b><i>(\sunelthont&#333;n aut&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive<br>
 absolute again. Paul could not go to the synagogue, as his custom<br>
 was, being a bound prisoner. So he invited the Jewish leaders to<br>
 come to his lodging and hear his explanation of his presence in<br>
 Rome as a prisoner with an appeal to Caesar. He is anxious that<br>
 they may understand that this appeal was forced upon him by<br>
 Festus following Felix and lot because he has come to make an<br>
 attack on the Jewish people. He was sure that false reports had<br>
 come to Rome. These non-Christian Jews accepted Paul's<br>
 invitation. <B>{Nothing against}</B> <b><i>(\ouden enantion\)</i></b>. Adjective here<br>
 as in <!-#-->26:9, not preposition as in <!-#-->7:10; 8:32. From \en\ and<br>
 \antios\ <b><i>(\anti\)</i></b>, face to face. Concessive participle \poi&#275;sas\<br>
 as in verse <!-#-->4 <b><i>(\dias&#333;thenta\)</i></b> which see. <B>{Yet was I delivered<br>
 prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans}</B> <b><i>(\desmios<br>
 ex Ierosolum&#333;n paredoth&#275;n eis tas cheiras t&#333;n Romai&#333;n\)</i></b>. This<br>
 condensed statement does not explain how he "was delivered," for<br>
 in fact the Jews were trying to kill him when Lysias rescued him<br>
 from the mob <b><i>(<!-#-->22:27-36)</i></b>. The Jews were responsible for his<br>
 being in the hands of the Romans, though they had hoped to kill<br>
 him first.<br>
 <br>
 28:18 <B>{When they had examined me}</B> <b><i>(\anakrinantes me\)</i></b>. First<br>
 aorist active participle of \anakrin&#333;\, the same verb used<br>
 already in <!-#-->24:8; 25:6,26 of the judicial examinations by Felix<br>
 and Festus. <B>{Desired}</B> <b><i>(\eboulonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of<br>
 attempted action or picture of their real attitude. This is a<br>
 correct statement as the words of both Felix and Festus show.<br>
 <B>{Because there was}</B> <b><i>(\dia to--huparchein\)</i></b>. Accusative case with<br>
 \dia\ <b><i>(causal use)</i></b> with the articular infinitive, "Because of the<br>
 being no cause of death in me" <b><i>(\en emoi\, in my case, \aitia\,<br>
 usual word for crime or charge of crime)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 28:19 <B>{When the Jews spake against it}</B> <b><i>(\antilegont&#333;n t&#333;n<br>
 Ioudai&#333;n\)</i></b>. Genitive absolute again, \antilegont&#333;n\ <b><i>(\antileg&#333;\)</i></b><br>
 common verb for speaking against as in <!-#-->13:45. _Clementer dicit_<br>
 <b><i>(Bengel)</i></b>. "The word is a mild one to describe the bitter enmity<br>
 of the Jews" <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b>. <B>{I was constrained}</B> <b><i>(\&#275;nagkasth&#275;n\)</i></b>. "I<br>
 was compelled," first aorist passive indicative of \anagkaz&#333;\,<br>
 the very word used of Paul's efforts to get the Christians to<br>
 blaspheme <b><i>(<!-#-->26:11)</i></b> which see. Paul was compelled to appeal to<br>
 Caesar <b><i>(see <!-#-->25:11,12 for this phrase)</i></b>, unless Paul was willing<br>
 to be the victim of Jewish hate when he had done no wrong. <B>{Not<br>
 that I had aught to accuse my nation of}</B> <b><i>(\ouch h&#333;s tou ethnous<br>
 mou ech&#333;n ti kat&#275;gorein\)</i></b>. This use of \h&#333;s\ with a participle<br>
 <b><i>(\ech&#333;n\)</i></b> is common in Greek for the alleged reason. The genitive<br>
 case with the infinitive \kat&#275;gorein\ is regular. Paul says<br>
 \ethnos\ instead of \laos\ as in <!-#-->24:17; 26:4.<br>
 <br>
 28:20 <B>{Did I intreat}</B> <b><i>(\parekalesa\)</i></b>. Did I invite you. <B>{Because<br>
 of the hope of Israel}</B> <b><i>(\heineken t&#275;s elpidos tou Israel\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive with preposition \heineken\. The hope of the Messiah is<br>
 his point as in <!-#-->26:6. <B>{I am bound with this chain}</B> <b><i>(\t&#275;n<br>
 halusin taut&#275;n perikeimai\)</i></b>. This old verb means to lie around as<br>
 in <!-#-->Lu 17:2; Heb 12:1. But it is also used as the passive of<br>
 \peritith&#275;mi\, to place around with the accusative of<br>
 \peritith&#275;mi\ retained. It is a transitive passive. Paul does not<br>
 lie around the chain, but the chain lies around him, a curious<br>
 reversal of the imagery <b><i>(Robertson, _Grammar_, p. 815)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 28:21 <B>{Letters}</B> <b><i>(\grammata\)</i></b>. Official documents from the<br>
 Sanhedrin about the charges against Paul. <B>{Any harm of thee}</B> <b><i>(\ti<br>
 peri sou pon&#275;ron\)</i></b>. <B>{Evil}</B> <b><i>(\pon&#275;ron\)</i></b>. The three aorists<br>
 <b><i>(\edexametha, ap&#275;ggeilen, elal&#275;sen\)</i></b> cover the past. These Jews<br>
 do not mean to say that they had never heard of Paul. It is<br>
 hardly likely that they had heard of his appeal to Caesar, "for<br>
 how could the news have reached Rome before Paul?" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 28:22 <B>{But we desire}</B> <b><i>(\axioumen de\)</i></b>. Old verb \axio&#333;\, to deem<br>
 worthy, to think right or proper as in <!-#-->15:38 which see. They<br>
 think it only fair to hear Paul's side of his case. <B>{Concerning<br>
 this sect}</B> <b><i>(\peri t&#275;s hairese&#333;s taut&#275;s\)</i></b>. Paul had identified<br>
 Christianity with Judaism <b><i>(verse <!-#-->20)</i></b> in its Messianic hope. The<br>
 language seems to imply that the number of Christians in Rome was<br>
 comparatively small and mainly Gentile. If the edict of Claudius<br>
 for the expulsion of the Jews from Rome <b><i>(<!-#-->Ac 18:2)</i></b> was due to<br>
 disturbance over Christ <b><i>(\Chr&#275;stus\)</i></b>, then even in Rome the Jews<br>
 had special reason for hostility towards Christians. <B>{Everywhere<br>
 spoken against}</B> <b><i>(\pantachou antilegetai\)</i></b>. Cf. verse <!-#-->19. The<br>
 line of cleavage between Jew and Christian was now sharply drawn<br>
 everywhere.<br>
 <br>
 28:23 <B>{Appointed}</B> <b><i>(\taxamenoi\)</i></b>. First aorist middle participle<br>
 of \tass&#333;\. Formal arrangement as in <!-#-->Mt 28:16 when Jesus<br>
 appointed the mountain for his meeting in Galilee. <B>{In great<br>
 number}</B> <b><i>(\pleiones\)</i></b>. Comparative of \polus\, "more than a few."<br>
 <B>{Expounded}</B> <b><i>(\exetitheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of \ektith&#275;mi\, to<br>
 set forth, as in <!-#-->11:4; 18:26. He did it with detail and care<br>
 and spent all day at it, "from morning till evening" <b><i>(\apo pr&#333;i<br>
 he&#333;s hesperas\)</i></b>. In N.T. only here, <!-#-->4:3 and <!-#-->Lu 24:29, though<br>
 common word. <B>{Persuading them concerning Jesus}</B> <b><i>(\peith&#333;n autous<br>
 peri tou I&#275;sou\)</i></b>. Conative present active participle, trying to<br>
 persuade. It was only about Jesus that he could make good his<br>
 claim concerning the hope of Israel <b><i>(verse <!-#-->20)</i></b>. It was Paul's<br>
 great opportunity. So he appealed both to Moses and to the<br>
 prophets for proof as it was his custom to do.<br>
 <br>
 28:24 <B>{Some believed}</B> <b><i>(\hoi men epeithonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect passive<br>
 indicative of \peith&#333;\. More exactly, "some began to be<br>
 persuaded" <b><i>(inchoative)</i></b>. <B>{Some disbelieved}</B> <b><i>(\hoi de &#275;pistoun\)</i></b>.<br>
 Imperfect active of \apiste&#333;\, to disbelieve, continued to<br>
 disbelieve. It is usually so.<br>
 <br>
 28:25 <B>{When they agreed not}</B> <b><i>(\asumph&#333;noi ontes\)</i></b>. Old adjective,<br>
 only here in N.T., double compound <b><i>(\a\ privative, \sum, ph&#333;n&#275;\)</i></b>,<br>
 without symphony, out of harmony, dissonant, discordant. It was a<br>
 triumph to gain adherents at all in such an audience. <B>{They<br>
 departed}</B> <b><i>(\apeluonto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle <b><i>(direct)</i></b> indicative,<br>
 "They loosed themselves from Paul." Graphic close. <B>{After that<br>
 Paul had spoken one word}</B> <b><i>(\eipontos tou Paulou rh&#275;ma hen\)</i></b>.<br>
 Genitive absolute. One last word <b><i>(like a preacher)</i></b> after the all<br>
 day exposition. <B>{Well}</B> <b><i>(\kal&#333;s\)</i></b>. Cf. <!-#-->Mt 14:7; Mr 7:6,9<br>
 <b><i>(irony)</i></b>. Here strong indignation in the very position of the word<br>
 <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. <B>{To your fathers}</B> <b><i>(\pros tous pateras hum&#333;n\)</i></b>. So Aleph A<br>
 B instead of \h&#275;m&#333;n\ <b><i>(our)</i></b> like Stephen in <!-#-->7:52 whose words<br>
 Paul had heard. By mentioning the Holy Spirit Paul shows<br>
 <b><i>(Knowling)</i></b> that they are resisting God <b><i>(<!-#-->7:52)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 28:26 <B>{Say}</B> <b><i>(\eipon\)</i></b>. Second aorist active imperative instead of<br>
 the old form \eipe\. The quotation is from <!-#-->Isa 6:9,10. This<br>
 very passage is quoted by Jesus <b><i>(<!-#-->Mt 13:14,15; Mr 4:12; Lu 8:10)</i></b><br>
 in explanation of his use of parables and in <!-#-->Joh 12:40 the very<br>
 point made by Paul here, "the disbelief of the Jews in Jesus"<br>
 <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. See on Matthew for discussion of the language used. Here<br>
 the first time <b><i>("go to this people and say")</i></b> does not occur in<br>
 Matthew. It is a solemn dirge of the doom of the Jews for their<br>
 rejection of the Messiah foreseen so long ago by Isaiah.<br>
 <br>
 28:28 <B>{This salvation}</B> <b><i>(\touto to s&#333;t&#275;rion\)</i></b>. Adjective from<br>
 \s&#333;t&#275;r\ <b><i>(Saviour)</i></b>, saving, bringing salvation. Common in the old<br>
 Greek. The neuter as here often in LXX <b><i>(as <!-#-->Ps 67:2)</i></b> as<br>
 substantive like \s&#333;t&#275;ria\ <b><i>(cf. <!-#-->Lu 3:6)</i></b>. <B>{They will also hear}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\autoi kai akousontai\)</i></b>. \Autoi\ as opposed to the rejection by<br>
 the Jews, "vivid and antithetical" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>.<br>
 <br>
 28:30 <B>{Two whole years}</B> <b><i>(\dietian hol&#275;n\)</i></b>. Only here in N.T. and<br>
 <!-#-->24:27 which see. During these busy years in Rome Paul wrote<br>
 Philippians, Philemon, Colossians, Ephesians, Epistles that would<br>
 immortalize any man, unless, forsooth, one or more of them was<br>
 written from Ephesus or Caesarea, which has not yet been proven.<br>
 <B>{In his own hired dwelling}</B> <b><i>(\en idi&#333;i misth&#333;mati\)</i></b>. Old word,<br>
 here only in N.T., that which is hired for a price <b><i>(from<br>
 \mistho&#333;\ and that from \misthos\, hire)</i></b>. <B>{Received}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\apedecheto\)</i></b>. Imperfect middle of \apodechomai\, received from<br>
 time to time as they came, all that came <b><i>(\eisporeuomenous\)</i></b> from<br>
 time to time. <B>{Preaching}</B> <b><i>(\keruss&#333;n\)</i></b>, <B>{teaching}</B> <b><i>(\didask&#333;n\)</i></b>,<br>
 the two things that concerned Paul most, doing both as if his<br>
 right hand was not in chains, to the amazement of those in Rome<br>
 and in Philippi <b><i>(<!-#-->Php 1:12-14)</i></b>. <B>{None forbidding him}</B><br>
 <b><i>(\ak&#333;lut&#333;s\)</i></b>. Old adverb from \a\ privative and the verbal<br>
 adjective \k&#333;lutos\ <b><i>(from \k&#333;lu&#333;\, to hinder)</i></b>, here only in the<br>
 N.T. Page comments on "the rhythmic cadence of the concluding<br>
 words." Page rejects the notion that the book is an unfinished<br>
 work. It closes with the style of a concluded work. I agree with<br>
 Harnack that Luke wrote the Acts during this period of two years<br>
 in Rome and carried events no further because they had gone no<br>
 further. Paul was still a prisoner in Rome when Luke completed<br>
 the book. But he had carried Paul to "Rome, the capital of the<br>
 world, _Urbi et Orbi_" <b><i>(Page)</i></b>. The gospel of Christ has reached<br>
 Rome. For the fate of Paul we must turn elsewhere. But Luke had<br>
 the presence of Paul while he carried the Acts to its triumphant<br>
 conclusion. Ramsay can give a good deal in proof of his claim<br>
 that Luke is the greatest of all historians. Beyond a doubt his<br>
 rank is high and the world can never repay its debt to this<br>
 cultured physician who wrote the Gospel and the Acts.<br>
