A. T. Robertson 


THIS SIX-VOLUME COMMENTARY on the 
New Testament was published in 
1930-33. Ministers and other Bible stu- 
dents still acclaim it for combining 
thorough scholarship with teaching 
skill and insight. 

“It is a verse by verse commentary 
on the English text (with the corre- 
sponding Greek in English letters) 
stressing those meaningful and _ picto- 
rial suggestions which are often im- 
plicit in the original significance of 
the words but are lost in translation. 
. . . The author makes available for 
those who do not know Greek a large 
amount of critical and exegetical ma- 
terial and of interpretative insight di- 
rectly connected with studies in the 
original text.”—The Christian Century 

Dr. Robertson’s scholarship was at 
all times unimpeachable, his spiritual 
insight was profound, and his style was 
of the highest order. His genial wit, his 
human touch and interest, and_ his 
unique phrasing carry an appeal for 
every reader.

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


Not a Happy TITLE 


There are various explanations of the term catholic (ka- 
tholikat epistolai) as applied to this group of seven short 
letters by four writers (one by James, two by Peter, one by 
Jude, three by John). The Latin for katholikos is generalis, 
though the Vulgate terms these letters Catholicae. The 
meaning is not orthodox as opposed to heretical or canon- 
ical, though they are sometimes termed Epistolae canonicae. - 
As a matter of fact five of the seven (all but First Peter and 
First John) Eusebius placed among the “disputed” (anfi- 
legomena) books of the New Testament. “A canonical book 
is primarily one which has been measured and tested, and 
secondarily that which is itself a measure or standard” 
(Alfred Plummer). Canon is from kanon (cane) and is like 
a yardstick cut to the right measure and then used as a 
measure. Some see in the term katholikos the idea that these 
Epistles are meant for both Jews and Gentiles, but the 
Epistle of James seems addressed to Jewish Christians. 
There were two other chief groups of New Testament writ- 
ings in the old Greek manuscripts (the Gospels and Acts, 
then the Epistles of Paul). This group of seven Epistles 
and the Apocalypse constitute the remainder of the New 
Testament. The usual interpretation of the term katholikos 
here is that these seven Epistles were not addressed to any 
particular church, but are general in their distribution. 
This is clearly true of I Peter, as is shown by the language 
in I Peter 1:1, where seven Roman provinces are mentioned. 
The language of II Peter 3:1 bears the same idea. Appar- 
ently the Epistle of Jude is general also as is I John. But 

x1 


xli BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


II John is addressed to “an elect lady” (verse 1) and III 
John to Gaius (verse 1), both of them individuals, and there- 
fore in no sense are these two brief letters general or catholic. 
The earliest instance of the word katholikos is in an inscrip- 
tion (B.c. 6) with the meaning “‘general” (427 katholikéi mou 
prothesei, my general purpose). It was common after that. 
The earliest example of it in Christian literature is in Igna- 
tius’ Epistle to the Church of Smyrna (VIII) where he has 
“the catholic church” (Aé@ katholiké ekklesia), “the general 
church,” not a local body. Clement of Alexandria (Strom. 
IV. xv) applies this adjective to the letter sent to the Gen- 
tile Christians “in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia” from the 
Jerusalem Conference (Acts 15:23). 


ORDER AND DATES 


The oldest Greek manuscripts give these General Epistles 
immediately after the Acts, and Westcott and Hort so print 
them in their Greek New Testament. But the English Ver- 
sions follow the Textus Receptus and put them just before 
the Apocalypse. The order of the seven letters varies 
greatly in the different manuscripts, though usually James 
comes first and Jude last (as the last accepted and the least 
known of the four authors). It is possible that the order of 
James, Peter, and John (omitting Jude) represented a sort 
of chronological precedence in some minds. It is possible 
also that no importance is to be attached to this order. 
Certainly John wrote last and after the destruction of Jeru- 
salem, while the others come before that great event if they 
are genuine, as I believe, though there are difficulties of a 
serious nature concerning II Peter. James may be very 
early. If so, these seven Epistles are scattered all. the 
way from A.D. 45 to go. They have no connection with 
He another save in the case of the Epistles of Peter and 

ude. 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION xiii 


IMPORTANCE OF THE GENERAL EPISTLES 


Without them we should be deprived of much concerning 
three outstanding personalities in early Christianity. We 
should know much less of ‘“‘James, and Cephas, and John, 
they who were reputed to be pillars” (Gal. 2:9). We should 
know less also of the Judaic (not Judaizing) form of Chris- 
tianity seen in the Epistles of James and Jude in contrast 
with, though not opposed to, the Pauline type. In Peter’s 
Epistles we see, indeed, a mediating position without com- 
promise of principle, for Peter in the Jerusalem Conference 
loyally supported Paul and Barnabas even if he did flicker 
for a moment later in Antioch. In the Johannine Epistles 
we see the great Eagle soar as in his Gospel in calm serenity 
in spite of conflict with the Gnostics who struck at the very 
life of Christianity itself. ‘The only opposition which re- 
mains worthy of a Christian’s consideration is that between 
light and darkness, truth and falsehood, love and hate, God 
and the world, Christ and Antichrist, life and death” (Plum- 
mer). So we can be grateful for the preservation of these 
little Epistles which reveal differences in the development 
of the great Christian leaders and the adaptation of the 
- gospel message to changing world conditions then and now.

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


_ Tue AvuTHoR 


He claims to be James, and so the book is not anonymous. 
It is either genuine or pseudonymous. He does not claim 
to be the brother of the Lord Jesus, as one might expect. 
James the brother of John was put to death by Herod 
Agrippa I about a.p. 44 (Acts 12:2). But James the brother 
of Jesus (Gal. 1:19) was still alive and became a leader of 
the church in Jerusalem (Acts 12:17), presiding over the © 
Conference in Jerusalem (Acts 15:13-21) and apparently 
writing the message from the Conference to the Gentile 
churches (15:22-29), and was still the leading elder in Jeru- 
salem on Paul’s last visit (21:18-25). James does not claim 
here to be an apostle and he was not one of the twelve 
apostles, and the dispute about accepting it of which Eu- 
sebius spoke was about its apostolicity since James was only 
an apostle by implication (Gal. 1:19) in the general sense of 
_ that term like Barnabas (Acts 14:14), perhaps Silas and 
Timothy (I Thess. 2:7), certainly not on a par with Paul, 
who claimed equality with the twelve. James, like the other 
brothers of Jesus, had once disbelieved his claims to be the 
Messiah (John 7:6f.), but he was won by a special vision of 
the Risen Christ (I Cor. 15:7) and was in the upper room 
before the great pentecost (Acts 1:14). It is plain that he 
had much to overcome as a zealous Jew to become a Chris- 
tian, though he was not a mere cousin of Jesus or a son of 
Joseph by a former marriage. He was strictly the half- 
brother of Jesus, since Joseph was not the actual father of 
Jesus. There is no reason to believe that he was a Nazirite. 
We know that he was married (I Cor. 9:5). He came to be 

3

called James the Just and was considered very devout. The 
Judaizers had counted on him to agree with them against 
Paul and Barnabas, but he boldly stood for Gentile freedom 
from the ceremonial law. The Judaizers still claimed him 
at Antioch and used his name wrongly to frighten Peter 
thereby (Gal. 2:12). But to the end he remained the loyal 
friend to Paul and his gospel rightly understood (Acts 21:18- 
25). Clement of Alexandria (Hypot. vii) says that, when he 
bore strong testimony to Jesus as the Son of man, they flung 
him down from the gable of the temple, stoned him, and 
beat him to death with a club. But Josephus (dnt. XX. 
ix. 1) says that the Sadducees about a.p. 62 had James and 
some others brought before the Sanhedrin (Ananus presiding) 
and had them stoned as transgressors of the law. At any 
rate he won a martyr’s crown like Stephen and James the 


brother of John. 


THE DaTE 


If the Epistle is genuine and James was put to death about 
A.D. 62, it was clearly written before that date. There are 
two theories about it, one placing it about a.p. 48, the other 
about a.p. 58. To my mind the arguments of Mayor for the 
early date are conclusive. There is no allusion to Gentile 
Christians, as would be natural after a.p. 50. If written 
after A.D. 70, the tone would likely be different, with some 
allusion to that dreadful calamity. The sins condemned are 
those characteristic of early Jewish Christians. The book 
itself is more like the Sermon on the Mount than the Epis- 
tles. The discussion of faith and works in chapter 2 reveals 
an absence of the issues faced by Paul in Rom. 4 and Gal. 3 
after the Jerusalem Conference (a.p. 49). Hence the date 
before that Conference has decidedly the better of the argu- 
ment. Ropes in his Commentary denies the genuineness of 
the Epistle and locates it between a.D. 75 and 125, but Hort 
holds that the evidence for a late date rests “on very slight 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 5 


and intangible grounds.” So we place the book before .p. 
49. It may indeed be the earliest New Testament book. 


THE READERS 


The author addresses himself ‘‘to the twelve tribes which 
are of the Dispersion” (James 1:1). Clearly, then, he is not 
writing to Gentiles, unless he includes the spiritual children 
of Abraham in the term Diaspora as Paul does for believers 
(Gal. 3:29; Rom. 9:6f.). The word diaspora occurs elsewhere 
in the N.T. only in John 7:35; I Pet. 1:1. It apparently has 
the spiritual significance in I Pet. 1:1, but in John 7:35 the 
usual meaning of Jews scattered over the world. The use 
here of ‘‘the twelve tribes”’ makes the literal sense probable . 
here. Clearly also James knew nothing of any “lost”’ tribes, 
for the Jews of the Dispersion were a blend of all the twelve 
tribes. It is probable also that James is addressing chiefly 
the Eastern Dispersion in Syria, Mesopotamia, and Baby- 
lonia as Peter writes to five provinces in the Western Dis- 
persion in Asia Minor. It is possible that James has in 
mind Christian and non-Christian Jews, not wholly non- 
Christian Jews as some hold. He may have in mind merely 
Christian Jews outside of Palestine, of whom there were al- 
ready many scattered since the great pentecost. The use of 
synagogue as a place of worship (2:2) like church (5:14) 
argues somewhat for this view. He presents the Mosaic 
law as still binding (2:g-11; 4:11). As the leading elder of 
the great church in Jerusalem and as a devout Jew and half- 
brother of Jesus, the message of James had a special appeal 
to these widely scattered Jewish Christians. 


THE Purpose 


If James is writing solely to non-Christian Jews, the pur- 
pose is to win them to Christ, and so he puts the gospel 
message in a way to get a hearing from the Jews. That is 
true, whether he has them in mind or not, though he does 


6 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


not do it by the suppression of the deity of Jesus Christ. 
In the very first verse he places him on a par with God as 
“the Lord Jesus Christ.”” In 2:1 he presents Jesus as the 
object of faith: “‘as you believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, 
who is the Glory” (Moffatt’s Translation), where Jesus is 
termed the Shekinah Glory of God. It is true that there is 
no discussion in the Epistle of the cross and the resurrection 
of Jesus, but there is an allusion to the murder of Jesus in 
§:6 and the second coming in 5:8. The chief aim of the 
Epistle is to strengthen the faith and loyalty of the Jewish 
Christians in the face of persecution from rich and over- 
bearing Jews who were defrauding and oppressing them. It 
is a picture of early Christian life in the midst of difficult 
social conditions between capital and labor which also exist 
today. So then it is a very modern message even if it 1s 
the earliest New Testament book. The glory of the New 
Testament lies precisely at this point in that the revelation 
of God in Christ meets our problems today because it did 
meet those of the first century a.p. Christian principles 
stand out clearly for our present-day living. 


THE STYLE 


James assumes the doctrinal features of Christianity, but 
he is concerned mainly with the ethical and social aspects 


of the gospel that Jewish followers of Christ may square . 


their lives with the gospel which they believe and profess. 
But this fact does not justify Luther in calling the Epistle 
of James ‘‘a veritable Epistle of straw.” Luther imagined 
that James contradicted Paul’s teaching of justification by 
faith. That is not true and the criticism of Luther is unjust. 
We shall see that, though James and Paul use the same 
words (faith, works, justify), they mean different things by 
them. It is possible that both Paul and Peter had read the 
Epistle of James, though by no means certain. M. Jones 
(New Testament in the Twentieth Century, >. 316) thinks that 


Me 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 7 


the author was familiar with Stoic philosophy. This is also 
possible, though he may have learned it only indirectly 
through the Wisdom of Solomon and Philo. What is true 
is that the author writes in the easy and accurate Koiné 
Greek of a cultivated Jew (the literary Koiné, not the ver- 
nacular), though not the artificial or stilted language of a 
professional stylist. Principal Patrick (ames the Lord’s 
Brother, p. 298) holds that he “‘had a wide knowledge of 
Classical Greek.” This does not follow, though he does use 
the manner “‘of the Hellenistic diatribe” (Ropes, Int. and 
Crit. Comm., p. 19) so common at that time. Ropes (pp. 
10 to 22) points out numerous parallels between James and 
the popular moral addresses of the period, familiar since the 
days of Socrates and at its height in Seneca and Epictetus. 
The use of an imaginary interlocutor is one instance (James 
2:18f.; 5:13f.) as is the presence of paradox (1:2, 10; 2:5; 
etc.). But the style of James is even more kin to that seen 
in the Jewish wisdom literature like Proverbs, the Wisdom 
of Solomon, etc. It is thus both tract and Epistle, a brief 
Christian sermon on a high plane for a noble purpose. But 
it is all natural and not artificial. The metaphors are many, 
but brief and remind one constantly of the Master’s use of 
them in the Sermon on the Mount. Did not Mary the 
mother of Jesus and James make frequent use of such homely 
parables? The author shows acquaintance with the LXX, 
but there are few Hebraisms in the language, though the 
style is Hebraic, as is the whole tone of the book (Hebraic 
and Christian). “The style is especially remarkable for con- 
stant hidden allusions to our Lord’s sayings, such as we find 
in the first three Gospels” (Hort).

of the Hebrew Jakob (so LXX). Common name among the 
Jews, and this man in Josephus (4nt. XX.9.1) and three 
others of this name in Josephus also. Servant (doulos). 
Bond-servant or slave as Paul (Rom. 1:1; Phil. 1:1; Tit. 
1:1). Of the Lord Fesus Christ (kuriou Iésou Christou). Were 
on a par with God (¢heou) and calls himself not adelphos 
(brother) of Jesus, but doulos. The three terms here as in 
2:1 have their full significance: Jesus is the Messiah and 
Lord. James is not an Ebionite. He accepts the deity of 
Jesus his brother, difficult as it was for him to. do so. The 
word kurios is frequent in the LXX for Elohim and Fahweh 
as the Romans applied it to the emperor in their emperor 
worship. See I Cor. 12:3 for Kurios Iésous and Phil. 2:11 
for Kurios Iésous Christos. To the twelve tribes (tais dodeka 
phulais). Dative case. The expression means “Israel in its 
fulness and completeness” (Hort), regarded as a unity (Acts 
26:7) with no conception of any “lost” tribes. Which are of 
the Dispersion (tais en téi diasporai). ‘Those in the Dis- 
persion” (repeated article). The term appears in Deut. 
28:25 (LXX) and comes from diaspeiré, to scatter (sow) 
abroad. In its literal sense we have it in John 7:34, but 
here and in I Pet. 1:1 Christian Jews are chiefly, if not wholly, 
in view. The Jews at this period were roughly divided into 
Palestinian Jews (chiefly agriculturists) and Jews of the Dis- 
persion (dwellers in cities and mainly traders). In Palestine 
Aramaic was spoken as a rule, while in the Western Diaspora 
the language was Greek (Koiné, LXX), though the Eastern 
Diaspora spoke Aramaic and Syriac. The Jews of the Dias- 
pora were compelled to compare their religion with the 

72 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 11 


various cults around them (comparative religion) and had 
a wider outlook on life. James writes thus in cultural Koiné 
but in the Hebraic tone. Greeting (chairein). Absolute in- 
finitive (present active of. chaird) as in Acts 15:23 (the 
Epistle to Antioch and the churches of Syria and Galatia). 
It is the usual idiom in the thousands of papyri letters 
known to us, but in no other New Testament letter. But 
note chairein legete in II John to and 11. 

2. Count it (hégésasthe). First aorist middle imperative of 
hégeomat, old verb to consider. Do it now and once for all. 
All joy (pasan charan). ‘‘Whole joy,” “unmixed joy,” as 
in Phil. 2:29. Not just “some joy” along with much grief. 
When (hotan). “Whenever,” indefinite temporal conjunc- 
tion. Ye fall into (peripeséte). Second aorist active sub- 
junctive (with the indefinite hotan) from peripip#o, literally 
to fall around (into the midst of), to fall among as in Luke 
10:30 /éistais periepesen (he fell among robbers). Only other 
N.T. example of this old compound is in Acts 27:41. Thu- 
cydides uses it of falling into affliction. It is the picture of 
being surrounded (peri) by trials. Manifold temptations 
(peirasmois poikilois). Associative instrumental case. The 
English word temptation is Latin and originally meant trials 
whether good or bad, but the evil sense has monopolized 
the word in our modern English, though we still say “at- 
tempt.” The word peirasmos (from peirazd, late form for 
the old peiraéd as in Acts 26:21, both in good sense as in 
John 6:6, and in bad sense as in Matt. 16:1) does not occur 
outside of the LXX and the N.T. except in Dioscorides 
(a.D. 100?) of experiments on diseases. ‘‘Trials” is clearly 
the meaning here, but the evil sense appears in verse 12 
(clearly in peirazo in verse 13) and so in Heb. 3:8. Trials 
rightly faced are harmless, but wrongly met become temp- 
tations to evil. The adjective poikilos (manifold) is as old 
as Homer and means variegated, many coloured as in Matt. 


12 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


4:24; 2 Tim. 3:6; Heb. 2:4. In I Pet. 1:6 we have this same 
phrase. It is a bold demand that James here makes. 

3. Knowing (gindskontes). Present active participle of 
ginosko (experimental knowledge, the only way of getting 
this view of “‘trials” as “all joy”). The proof (to dokimion). 
Now known (Deissmann, Bible Studies, pp. 259ff.) from the 
papyri examples of dokimios as an adjective in the same 
sense (good gold, standard gold) as dokimos proved or tested 
(James 1:12). The use of to dokimion (neuter article with 
neuter single adjective) here and in I Pet. 1:7, clearly means 
“the genuine element in your faith,” not “crucible” nor 
“proving.” Your faith like gold stands the test of fire and 
is approved as standard. James here, as in verse 6; 2:1; 
§:15, regards faith (pistis) like Paul “as the very foundation 
of religion” (Mayor). Worketh (katergazetai). Present (du- 
rative) middle indicative of the compound verb with the 
perfective sense of kata as in Phil. 2:12, which see. Patience 
(hupomonén). Old and common word for remaining under 
(Aupomend), “staying power” (Ropes), as in Col. 1:11. 

4. Let have (echetd). Present active imperative of echd, let 
it keep on having. Perfect (teleion). See Rom. 5:3f. for a 
like chain of blessings. Carry on the work to the end or 
completion (from ¢e/os, end) as in John 17:4 (¢o ergon telei- 
dsas, having finished the work). That ye may be (hina éte). 
Purpose clause with hina and present active subjunctive of 
eimi. This is the goal of patience. Perfect and entire (teleioi 
kai holokleroi). Perfected at the end of the task (¢e/os) and 
complete in all parts (Aolok/éroi, holos whole and kiéros lot or 
part). “Perfected all over.” These two adjectives often 
occur together in Philo, Plutarch, etc. See Acts 3:16 for 
holoklérian (perfect soundness). Lacking in nothing (en 
médeni leipomenoi). Present passive participle of /eipd.to 
leave. Negative statement of the preceding positive as 
often in James (cf. 1:6). There is now a digression (verses 
5 to 8) from the discussion of peirasmos, which is taken up 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 13 


again in verse 9. The word J/eipomenoi (lacking) suggests 
the digression. 

5. Lacketh wisdom (leipetai sophias). Condition of first 
class, assumed as true, ei and present passive indicative of 
leipo to be destitute of, with ablative case sophias. “If any 
one falls short of wisdom.” A banking figure, to have a 
shortage of wisdom (not just knowledge, gvdseds, but wisdom 
sophias, the practicaluseof knowledge). Let him ask (aiteito). 
Present active imperative of aited, “let him keep on ask- 
ing.” Of God (para tou theou). ‘From (from beside) God,” 
ablative case with para. Liberally (haplos). This old adverb 
occurs here only in the N.T. (from hap/ous, single-fold, Matt. 
6:22, and haplofés, simplicity, generosity, is common—II Cor. 
8:2; Rom. 12:8). But the adverb is common in the papyri 
by way of emphasis as simply or at all (Moulton and Milli- 
gan’s Vocabulary). Mayor argues for the sense of ‘“‘uncon- 
ditionally”’ (the logical moral sense) while Hort and Ropes 
agree and suggest “graciously.” The other sense of “‘abun- 
dantly” or “‘liberally” suits the idea in Aaplotés in II Cor. 
8:2 and Rom. 12:8, but no example of the adverb in this 
sense has been found unless this is one here. See Is. 55:1 
for the idea of God’s gracious giving and the case of Solomon 
(I Kings 3:9-12; Prov. 2:3). Upbraideth not (mé oneidi- 
zontos). Present active participle of oneidizd (old verb to 
reproach, to cast in one’s teeth, Matt. 5:11) in the ablative 
case like didontos agreeing with theou and with the usual 
negative of the participle (mé). This is the negative state- 
ment of didontos haplos (giving graciously). The evil habit 
of giving stinging words along with the money is illustrated 
in Sirach 41:22 and Plutarch (De adulat., p. 64A). Cf. Heb. 
4:16. And it shall be given him (kai dothésetai autoi). First 
future passive of didomi, a blessed promise in accord with 
the words of Jesus (Matt. 7:7, 11; Luke 11:13), meaning 
here not only “wisdom,” but all good gifts, including the 


14 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Holy Spirit. There are frequent reminiscences of the words 
of Jesus in this Epistle. 

6. In faith (en pistei). Faith here “is the fundamental 
religious attitude” (Ropes), belief in God’s beneficent ac- 
tivity and personal reliance on him (Oesterley). Nothing 
doubting (méden diakrinomenos). Negative way of saying 
en pistei (in faith), present passive participle of diakrind, old 
verb to separate (krind) between (dia), to discriminate as 
shown clearly in Acts 11:12, 15:9, but no example of the 
sense of divided against oneself has been found earlier than 
the N.T., though it appears in later Christian writings. It 
is like the use of diamerizomai in Luke 11:18 and occurs in 
Matt. 21:21; Mark 11:23; Acts 10:20; Rom. 2:4; 4:20; 14:23. 
It is a vivid picture of internal doubt. Js like (eoiken). 
Second perfect active indicative with the linear force alone 
from eiké to be like. Old form, but in N.T. only here and 
verse 23 (a literary touch, not in LXX). The surge of the 
sea (kludoni thalassés). Old word (from k/uzd to wash 
against) for a dashing or surging wave in contrast with kuma 
(successive waves), in N.T. only here and Luke 8:24. In 
associative instrumental case after eoiken. In Eph. 4:14 we 
have kludonizé (from kludoén), to toss by waves. Driven by 
the wind (anemizomendi). Present passive participle (agree- 
ing in case with k/udoni) of anemiz6, earliest known example 
and probably coined by James (from anemos), who is fond 
of verbs in -izd (Mayor). The old Greek used anemod. In 
Eph. 4:14 Paul uses both k/udonizo and peripherod anemot. 
It is a vivid picture of the sea whipped into white-caps by 
the winds. Tossed (ripizomendi). Present passive participle 
also in agreement with k/udoni from ripizd, rare verb (Aris- 
tophanes, Plutarch, Philo) from ripis (a bellows or fire-fan), 
here only in N.T. It is a picture of “the restless swaying 
to and fro of the surface of the water, blown upon by shift- 
ing breezes”’ (Hort), the waverer with slight rufflement. 

4. That man (ho anthropos ekeinos). Emphatic use of 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 15 


ekeinos. Of the Lord (para tou kuriou). Ablative case with 
para like theou in verse 5. 

8. Man (anér). Instead of anthropos (general term) in 
verse 7, perhaps for variety (Ropes), but often in James 
(1:12, 23; 2:2; 3:2), though in other Epistles usually in dis- 
tinction from guné (woman). Double-minded (dipsuchos). 
First appearance of this compound known and in N.T. only 
here and 4:8. Apparently coined by James, but copied often 
in early Christian writings and so an argument for the early 
date of James’ Epistle (Moulton and Milligan’s Vocabulary). 
From dis twice and psuché soul, double-souled, double- 
minded, Bunyan’s “Mr. Facing-both-ways.” Cf. the rebuke 
to Peter (edistasas) in Matt. 14:31. Unstable (akatastatos). 
Late double compound (alpha privative and katastatos verbal 
from kathistémi), in LXX once (Is. 54:11) and in Polybius, 
in N.T. only here and 3:8. It means unsteady, fickle, stagger- 
ing, reeling like a drunken man. Surely to James such 
“doubt” is no mark of intellectuality. 

g. But (de). Return to the point of view in verse 2. Of 
low degree (ho tapeinos). “The lowly” brother, in outward 
condition (Luke 1:52), humble and poor as in Ps. 9:39; Prov. 
30:14, not the spiritually humble as in Matt. 11:29; James 
4:6. In the LXX sapeinos was used for either the poor in 
goods or the poor in spirit. Christianity has glorified this 
word in both senses. Already the rich and the poor in the 
churches had their occasion for jealousies. Glory in his high 
estate (kauchasthd en toi hupsei autou). Paradox, but true. 
In his low estate he is “in his height” (Aupsos, old word, 
in N.T., also in Luke 1:78; Eph. 3:1; etc.). 

10. In that he is made low (en téi tapeindsei autou). “In 
his low estate.” Play on tapeindsis (from tapeinod, Phil. 
3:7), like tapeinos of verse 9, old word in various senses, 
in N.T. only here, Luke 1:48; Acts 8:33; Phil. 3:21. The 
Cross of Christ lifts up the poor and brings down the high. 
It is the great leveller of men. 4s the flower of the grass 


1 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(hos anthos chortou). From the LXX (Is. 40:6). Chortos 
means pasture, then grass (Mark 6:39) or fodder. <Anthos 
is old word, in N.T. only here, verse 11, and I Pet. 1:24 
(same quotation). This warning is here applied to “the 
rich brother,” but it is true of all. He shall pass away 
(pareleusetai). Wuture middle indicative (effective aoristic 
future, shall pass completely away from earth). 

11. Ariseth (aneteilen). Gnomic or timeless aorist active 
indicative of the old compound azatellé, used here of plants 
(cf. anathallé in Phil. 4:10), often of the sun (Matt. 13:6). 
With the scorching wind (sun toi kausoni). Associative in- 
strumental case with sun. In the LXX this late word (from 
kausos) is usually the sirocco, the dry east wind from the 
desert (Job 1:19). In Matt. 20:12 and Luke 12:56 it is the 
burning heat of the sun. Either makes sense here. With- 
ereth (exéranen). Another gnomic aorist active indicative 
(Robertson, Grammar, p. 837) of xéraind, old verb (from 
xéros, dry or withered, Matt. 12:10), to dry up. Grass and 
flowers are often used to picture the transitoriness of human 
life, Falleth (exepesen). Another gnomic aorist (second 
aorist active indicative) of ekpipto to fall out (off). The 
grace (hé euprepeia). Old word (from euprepés well-looking, 
not in the N.T.), only here in N.T. Goodly appearance, 
beauty. Of the fashion of it (tou prosopou autou). ““Of the 
face of it.” The flower is pictured as having a “‘face,” like 
a rose or lily. Perisheth (apoleto). Another gnomic aorist 
(second aorist middle indicative of apollumi, to destroy, but 
intransitive here, to perish). The beautiful rose is pitiful 
when withered. Shall fade away (maranthésetai). Future 
passive indicative of maraind, old verb, to extinguish a flame, 
a light. Used of roses in Wisdom 2:8. Goings (poreiais). 
Old word from poreud to journey, in N.T. only here and 
Luke 13:22 (of Christ’s journey toward Jerusalem). The 
rich man’s travels will come to “journey’s end.” | 

12. Endureth (hupomenei). Present active indicative of 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 17 


hupomend. Cf. verse 3. Temptation (peirasmon). Real 
temptation here. See verse 2 for “‘trials.” When he hath 
been approved (dokimos genomenos). “Having become ap- 
proved,” with direct reference to fo dokimion in verse 3. 
See also Rom. 5:4 for dokimé (approval after test as of gold 
or silver). This beatitude (makarios) is for the one who has 
come out unscathed. See I Tim. 6:9. The crown of life 
(ton stephanon tés xoés). The same phrase occurs in Rev. 
2:10. It is the genitive of apposition, life itself being the 
crown as in I Pet. 5:4. This crown is “an honourable orna- 
ment” (Ropes), with possibly no reference to the victor’s 
crown (garland of leaves) as with Paul in I Cor. 9:25; II 
Tim. 4:8, nor to the linen fillet (diadema) of royalty (Ps. 
20:3, where stephanos is used like diadéma, the kingly crown). 
Stephanos has a variety of uses. Cf. the thorn chaplet on 
Jesus (Matt. 27:29). The Lord. Not in the oldest Greek 
MSS., but clearly implied as the subject of epéggeilato (he 
promised, first aorist middle indicative). 

13. Let no one say (médeis legeto). Present active im- 
perative, prohibiting such a habit. When he is tempted 
(peirazomenos). Present passive participle of peirazd, here 
in evil sense of tempt, not test, as in Matt. 4:1. Verses 12 
to 18 give a vivid picture of temptation. I am tempted of 
God (apo theou peirazomai). The use of apo shows origin 
(apo with ablative case), not agency (Aupo), as in Mark 
1:13, of Satan. It is contemptible, but I have heard wicked 
and weak men blame God for their sins. Cf. Prov. 19:3; 
Sirach 15:11f. Temptation does not spring “from God.” 
Cannot be tempted with evil (apeirastos kakon). Verbal com- 
pound adjective (alpha privative and peirazo), probably 
with the ablative case, as is common with alpha privative 
(Robertson, Grammar, p. 516), though Moulton (Proleg- 
omena, p. 74) treats it as the genitive of definition. The 
ancient Greek has apeiratos (from peirad), but this is the 
earliest example of apeirastos (from peirazd) made on the 


LCIBRARY OF JESS COOKE 


18 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


same model. Only here in the N.T. Hort notes apetratos 
kakon as a proverb (Diodorus, Plutarch, Josephus) “‘free 
from evils.” That is possible here, but the context calls 
for ““untemptable” rather than “untempted.” And he him- 
self tempteth no man (petrazei de autos oudena). Because 
“untemptable.” 

14. When he is drawn away by his own lust (hupo tés idias 
epithumias exelkomenos). Epithumia is old word for craving 
(from epithumed, to have a desire for) either good (Phil. 
1:23) or evil (Rom. 7:7) as here. Like a fish drawn out 
from his retreat. Enticed (deleazomenos). Present passive 
participle of deleazd, old verb from delear (bait), to catch 
fish by bait or to hunt with snares and Philo has huph’ 
hédonés deleazetai (is enticed by pleasure). In N.T. only 
here and II Pet. 2:14, 18. Allured by definite bait. 

15. Then (eita). The next step. The lust (hé epithumia). 
Note article, the lust (verse 14) which one has. When it 
hath conceived (sullabousa). Second aorist active participle 
of sullambano, old word to grasp together, in hostile sense 
(Acts 26:21), in friendly sense of help (Phil. 4:3), in tech- 
nical sense of a woman taking a man’s seed in conception 
(Luke 1:24), here also of lust (as a woman), “having con- 
ceived.” The will yields to lust and conception takes place. 
Beareth sin (tiktet hamartian). Present active indicative of 
tikto to bring forth as a mother or fruit from seed, old verb, 
often in N.T., here only in James. Sin is the union of the 
will with lust. See Ps. 7:14 for this same metaphor. The — 
sin (hé hamartia). The article refers to hamartia just men- 
tioned. When it is’ full-grown (apotelestheisa). First aorist 
passive participle of apoteled, old compound verb with per- 
fective use of apo, in N.T. only here and Luke 13:32. It 
does not mean “full-grown” like ¢e/eiod, but rather com- 
pleteness of parts or functions as opposed to rudimentary 
state (Hort) like the winged insect in contrast with the 
chrysalis or grub (Plato). The sin at birth is fully equipped 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 19 


for its career (Rom. 6:6; Col. 3:5). Bringeth forth death 
(apokuei thanaton). Late compound (kweé to be pregnant, 
perfective use of apo) to give birth to, of animals and women, 
for normal birth (papyrus example) and abnormal birth 
(Hort). A medical word (Ropes) rather than a literary one 
like tiktd. The child of lust is sin, of sin is death, powerful 
figure of abortion. The child is dead at birth. For death 
as the fruit of sin see Rom. 6:21-23; 8:6. “‘The birth of 
death follows of necessity when one sin is fully formed” 
(Hort). 

16. Be not deceived (mé plandsthe). Prohibition with mé 
and the present passive imperative of planad, common verb 
to lead astray. This is the way of sin to deceive and to kill © 
(Rom. 7:7-14). The devil is a pastmaster at blinding men’s 
eyes about sin (II Cor. 4:4; Rom. 1:27; Eph. 4:14; etc.). 

17. Gift (dosis)—boon (déréma). Both old substantives 
from the same original verb (diddmi), to give. Dosis is the 
act of giving (ending -sis), but sometimes by metonymy 
for the thing given like ktisis for ktisma (Col. 1:15). But 
dorema (from dored, from déron a gift) only means a gift, a 
benefaction (Rom. 5:16). The contrast here argues for 
“giving” as the idea in dosis. Curiously enough there is 
a perfect hexameter line here: pasa do / sis aga / thé kai / 
pan do / rema te / leion. Such accidental rhythm occurs 
occasionally in many writers. Ropes (like Ewald and 
Mayor) argues for a quotation from an unknown source 
because of the poetical word doréma, but that is not con- 
clusive. From above (anothen). That is, from heaven. Cf. 
John 3:31; 19:11. Coming down (katabainon). Present ac- 
tive neuter singular participle of katabaind agreeing with 
dorema, expanding and explaining andthen (from above). 
From the Father of lights (apo tou patros ton photon). “Of 
the lights” (the heavenly bodies). For this use of pasér see 
Job 38:28 (Father of rain); II Cor. 1:3; Eph. 1:17. God 
is the Author of light and lights. With whom (par’ hdi). 


20 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


For para (beside) with locative sense for standpoint of God 
see para toi theoi (Mark 10:27; Rom. 2:11; 9:14; Eph. 6:9. 
Can be no (ouk eni). This old idiom (also in Gal. 3:28; 
Col. 3:11) may be merely the original form of en with reces- 
sive accent (Winer, Mayor) or a shortened form of enesti. 
The use of evi en in I Cor. 6:5 argues for this view, as does 
the use of eine (einai) in Modern Greek (Robertson, Gram- 
mar, p. 313). Variation (parallagé). Old word from paral- 
lasso, to make things alternate, here only in N.T. In 
Aristeas in sense of alternate stones in pavements. Dio 
Cassius has parallaxis without reference to the modern 
astronomical parallax, though James here is comparing God 
(Father of the lights) to the sun (Mal. 4:2), which does 
have periodic variations. Shadow that is cast by turning 
(tropes aposkiasma). Tropé is an old word for “turning” 
(from trepé to turn), here only in N.T. Aposkiasma is a 
late and rare word (aposkiasmos in Plutarch) from aposkiazé 
(apo, skia) a shade cast by one object on another. It is 
not clear what the precise metaphor is, whether the shadow 
thrown’ on the dial (aposkiazé in Plato) or the borrowed 
light of the moon lost to us as it goes behind the earth. In 
fact, the text is by no means certain, for Aleph B papyrus 
of fourth century actually read hé tropés aposkiasmatos (the 
variation of the turning of the shadow). Ropes argues 
strongly for this reading, and rather convincingly. At any 
rate there is no such periodic variation in God like that we 
see in the heavenly bodies. 

18. Of his own will (boulétheis). First aorist passive par- 
ticiple of doulomai. Repeating the metaphor of birth in 
verse 15, but in good sense. God as Father acted deliber- 
ately of set purpose. He brought us forth (apekuésen). First 
aorist active indicative of apokued (verse 15), only here of 
the father (4 Macc. 15:17), not of the mother. Regenera- 
tion, not birth of all men, though God is the Father in the 
sense of creation of all men (Acts 17:28f.). By the word of 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 21 


truth (logoi alétheias). Instrumental case Jogdi. The refer- 
ence is thus to the gospel message of salvation even without 
the article (II Cor. 6:7) as here, and certainly with the 
article (Col. 1:5; Eph. 1:13; II Tim. 2:15). The message 
marked by truth (genitive case alétheias). That we should 
be (eis to einai hemas). Purpose clause eis to and the in- 
finitive einai with the accusative of general reference hemds 
(as to us). 4 kind of first-fruits (aparchén tina). “Some 
first-fruits” (old word from aparchomai), of Christians of 
that age. See Rom. 16:5. 

19. Ye know this (iste). Or “know this.” Probably the 
perfect active indicative (literary form as in Eph. §:5; Heb. 
12:17, unless both are imperative, while in James 4:4 we 
have oidate, the usual vernacular Koiné perfect indicative). 
The imperative uses only iste and only the context can de- 
cide which it is. Esto (let be) is imperative. Swift to hear 
(tachus eis to akousai). For this use of eis to with the in- 
finitive after an adjective see I Thess. 4:9. For eis to after 
adjectives see Rom. 16:19. The picture points to listening 
to the word of truth (verse 18) and is aimed against violent 
and disputatious speech (chapter 3:1-12). The Greek moral- 
ists often urge a quick and attentive ear. Slow to speak 
(bradus eis to lalésai). Same construction and same ingres- 
sive aorist active infinitive, slow to begin speaking, not 
slow while speaking. Slow to anger (bradus eis orgen). He 
drops the infinitive here, but he probably means that slow- 
ness to speak up when angry will tend to curb the anger. 

20. The wrath of man (orgé andros). Here anér (as op- 
posed to guné woman), not anthropos of verse 19 (inclusive 
of both man and woman). If taken in this sense, it means 
that a man’s anger (settled indignation in contrast with 
thumos, boiling rage or fury) does not necessarily work God’s 
righteousness. There is such a thing as righteous indigna- 
tion, but one is not necessarily promoting the cause of God 
by his own personal anger. See Acts 10:35 for “working 


22 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


righteousness,” and James 2:9 for ‘working sin” (ergazomat 
both times). 

21. Wherefore (dio). Because of this principle. See Eph. 
4:25. Putting away (apothemenoi). Second aorist middle 
participle of apotithémi, to put off, metaphor of removing 
clothing as in Rom. 13:12; Col. 3:8; Eph. 4:22, 25; I Pet. 
2:1, Filthiness (ruparian). Late word (Plutarch) from 
ruparos, dirty (James 2:2), here only in N.T. Surely a 
dirty garment. Overflowing of wickedness (perisseian kakias). 
Perisseia is a late word (from perissos, abundant, exceeding), 
only four times in N.T., in II Cor. 8:2 with charas (of joy), 
in Rom. 5:17 with charitos (of grace). Kakia (from kakos, 
evil) can be either general like ruparia (filthiness, naughti- 
ness), or special like “‘malice.” But any of either sense is 
a “superfluity.” With meekness (en praiitéti). In docility. 
“The contrast is with org@ rather than kakias” (Ropes). 
The implanted word (ton emphuton logon). This old verbal 
adjective (from emphué to implant, to grow in), only here 
in N.T., meaning properly ingrown, inborn, not emphuteuton 
(engrafted). It is “the rooted word” (verse 18), sown in 
the heart as the soil or garden of God (Matt. 13:3-23; 
15:13; I Cor. 3:6). Able to save (dunamenon sisai). CE. 
I Pet. 1:9; James 2:14; 4:12; 5:20; Rom. 1:16. Ultimate 
salvation (effective aorist active infinitive sdsai from 5020). 

22. But be ye (ginesthe de). Rather, “But keep on be- 
coming” (present middle imperative of ginomai). Doers of 
the word (poietai logou). Old word for agent (-tés) from 
poied to do as in 4:11; Rom. 2:13, but in Acts 17:28 our 
“poet” (long regarded as a “doer” or “‘maker”). Hearers 
(akroatai). Old word for agent again from akroamai (to be 
a hearer), in N.T. only here and Rom. 2:13. Deluding your- 
selves (paralogizomenoi heautous). Present middle (direct) 
participle of paralogizomai, to reckon aside (para) and so 
wrong, to cheat, to deceive. Redundant reflexive heautous 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 23 
with the middle. In N.T. only here and Col. 2:4. Such a 


man does not delude anyone but himself. 

23. And not a doer (kai ou poiétés). Condition of first 
class, assumed as true, and ow (rather than mé) contrasts 
potetés with akroatés. Unto a man beholding (andri kata- 
noounti). Associative instrumental case after eoitken as in 
1:6. Note andri as in 1:8 in contrast with gunaiki (woman), 
not anthropoi (general term for man). Present active par- 
ticiple of katanoed to put the mind down on (kata, nous), 
to consider attentively, to take note of, as in verse 24 
(katenoesen). His natural face (to prosopon tés geneseds au- 
tou). ““The face of his birth” (origin, lineage, nativity). 
For this use of genesis see 3:6; Matt. 1:1, 18; Luke 1:13: 
In a mirror (en esoptroi). Old word (from eis, opto) in N.T. 
only here and I Cor. 13:12. The mirrors of the ancients 
were not of glass, but of polished metal (of silver or usually 
of copper and tin). See katoptrizomai in II Cor. 3:18. 

24. He beholdeth himself (katenoésen heauton). Usually ex- 
plained as gnomic aorist like those in 1:11, but the ordinary 
force of the tenses is best here. “He glanced at himself 
(katenoésen aorist) and off he has gone (apeléluthen perfect 
active) and straightway forgot (epelatheto, second aorist 
middle indicative of epilanthanomai) what sort of a man he 
was” (hopoios én, back in the picture, imperfect tense). 
The tenses thus present a vivid and lifelike picture of the 
careless listener to preaching (Christ’s wayside hearer). 

25. He that looketh into (ho parakupsas). First aorist ac- 
tive articular participle of parakupto, old verb, to stoop and 
look into (John 20:5, 11), to gaze carefully by the side of, 
to peer into or to peep into (I Pet. 1:12). Here the notion 
of beside (para) or of stooping (kuptd) 1s not strong. Some- 
times, as Hort shows, the word means only a cursory glance, 
but the contrast with verse 24 seems to preclude that here. 
The perfect law (nomon teleion). For teleion see 1:17. See 
Rom. 7:12 for Paul’s idea of the law of God. James here 


24 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


refers to the word of truth (1:18), the gospel of grace (Gal. 
6:2; Rom. 12:2). The law of liberty (ton tés eleutherias). 
“That of liberty,” explaining why it is “perfect” (2:12 
also), rests on the work of Christ, whose truth sets us free 
(John 8:32; II Cor. 3:16; Rom. 8:2). And so continueth 
(kai parameinas). First aorist active articular participle 
again of paramend, parallel with parakupsas. Parameno is 
to stay beside, and see Phil. 1:25 for contrast with the 
simplex mend. Being (genomenos). Rather, “having be- 
come” (second aorist middle participle of ginomai to be- 
come). Nota hearer that forgetteth (ouk akroatés epilesmonés). 
“Not a hearer of forgetfulness” (descriptive genitive, marked 
by forgetfulness). Epilésmoné is a late and rare word (from 
epilésmon, forgetful, from epilanthomai, to forget, as in verse 
24), here only in N.T. But a doer that worketh (alla poiétés 
ergou). “But a doer of work,” a doer marked by work 
(descriptive genitive ergou), not by mere listening or mere 
talk. In his doing (en téi poiései autou). Another beatitude 
with makarios as in 1:12, like the Beatitudes in Matt. 
§:3-12.° Poiésis is an old word (from poieo for the act of 
doing), only here in N.T. 

26. Thinketh himself to be religious (dokei thréskos einai). 
Condition of first class (ei-dokei). Thréskos (of uncertain et- 
ymology, perhaps from threomai, to mutter forms of prayer) 
is predicate nominative after einai, agreeing with the sub- 
ject of dokei (either “he seems” or “he thinks’). This 
source of self-deception is in saying and doing. The word 
threskos is found nowhere else except in lexicons. Hatch 
(Essays in Biblical Greek, pp. 55-57) shows that it refers 
to the external observances of public worship, such as 
church attendance, almsgiving, prayer, fasting (Matt. 6:1- 
18). Itis the Pharisaic element in Christian worship. While 
he bridleth not his tongue (mé chalinagogon glossan heautou). 
“Not bridling his own tongue.” A reference to verse 19 
and the metaphor is repeated in 3:12. This is the earliest 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 25 


known example of the compound chalinagoged (chalinos, 
bridle agd, to lead). It occurs also in Lucian. The picture 
is that of a man putting the bridle in his own mouth, not 
in that of another. See the similar metaphor of muzzling 
(phimod) one’s mouth (Matt. 22:12 ephimothé). Deceiveth 
(apaton). Present active participle from apaté (deceit). He 
plays a trick on himself. Religion (thréskeia). Later form 
of thréskié (Herodotus) from thréskos above. It means re- 
ligious worship in its external observances, religious exer- 
cise or discipline, but not to the exclusion of reverence. In 
the N.T. we have it also in Acts 26:5 of Judaism and in 
Col. 2:18 of worshipping angels. It is vain (mataios, fem- 
inine form same as masculine) or empty. Comes to nothing. 

27. Pure religion and undefiled (thréskeia kathara kai ami- 
antos). Numerous examples in papyri and inscriptions of 
thréskeia for ritual and reverential worship in the Roman 
Empire (Moulton and Milligan’s Vocabulary; Deissmann, 
St. Paul, p. 251). As Hort shows, this is not a definition 
of religion or religious worship, but only a pertinent illus- 
tration of the right spirit of religion which leads to such 
acts. Before our God and Father (para toi theot kai patri). 
By the side of (para) and so from God’s standpoint (Mark 
10:27). Amiantos (compound verbal adjective, alpha priva- 
tive, miaino to defile), puts in negative form (cf. 1:4, 6) 
the idea in kathara (pure, clean). This (haute). Feminine 
demonstrative pronoun in the predicate agreeing with thrés- 
keia. To visit (episkeptesthai). Epexegetic (explaining haute) 
present middle infinitive of episkeptomai, common verb to 
go to see, to inspect, present tense for habit of going to see. 
See Matt. 25:36, 43 for visiting the sick. The fatherless and 
widows (orphanous kai chéras). “The natural objects of 
charity in the community” (Ropes). Orphanos is old word 
for bereft of father or mother or both. In N.T. only here 
and John 14:18. Note order (orphans before widows). Un- 
spotted (aspilon). Old adjective (alpha privative and spilos, 


26 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


spot), spotless. This the more important of the two illus- 
trations and the hardest to execute. To keep (férein). 
Present active infinitive, “to keep on keeping oneself un- 
specked from the world” (a world, kosmos, full of dirt and 
slime that bespatters the best of men). 


CHAPTER II 


1. My brethren (adelphoi mou). Transition to a new topic 
as in 1:19; 2:5, 14; 3:1; 5:7. Hold not (mé echete). Present 
active imperative of echd with negative mé, exhortation to 
stop holding or not to have the habit of holding in the 
fashion condemned. The faith of our Lord Fesus Christ (ten 
pistin tou kuriou hémon Iésou Christou). Clearly objective 
genitive, not subjective (faith of), but “faith in our Lord 
Jesus Christ,” like echete pistin theou (Mark 11:22), “‘have 
faith in God.”” See the same objective genitive with pistis 
in Acts 3:6; Gal. 2:16; Rom. 3:22; Rev. 14:12. Note also 
the same combination as in 1:1 “our Lord Jesus Christ” 
(there on a par with God). The Lord of Glory (tés doxés). 
Simply ‘“‘the Glory.” No word for “Lord” (kuriou) in the 
Greek text. Tés doxés clearly in apposition with tou kuriou 
Iésou Christou. James thus terms ‘“‘our Lord Jesus Christ” 
the Shekinah Glory of God. See Heb. 9:5 for “‘the cherubim 
of Glory.”” Other New Testament passages where Jesus 1s 
pictured as the Glory are Rom. g:4; II Cor. 4:6; Eph. 1:17; 
Heb. 1:3. Cf. II Cor. 8:9; Phil. 2:5-11. With respect of 
persons (en prosopolempsiais). A Christian word, like proso- 
polémptés (Acts 10:34) and prosdpolempteite (James 2:9), not 
in LXX or any previous Greek, but made from prosopon 
lambanein (Luke 20:21; Gal. 2:6), which is a Hebrew idiom 
for panim nasa, “to lift up the face on a person,” to be 
favorable and so partial to him. See prosdpolempsia in this 
sense of partiality (respect of persons) in Rom. 2:11; Col. 
3:25; Eph. 6:9 (nowhere else in N.T.). Do not show 
partiality. 

2. For (gar). An illustration of the prohibition. Jf there 
come in (ean eiselthéi). Condition of third class (supposable 

27 


28 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


case) with ean and second (ingressive) aorist active sub- 
junctive of eiserchomai. Into your synagogue (eis sunagogén 
humoén). The common word for the gathering of Jews for 
worship (Luke 12:11) and particularly for the building where 
they met (Luke 4:15, 20, 28, etc.). Here the first is the 
probable meaning as it clearly is in Heb. 10:25 (té episuna- 
gogén heauton), where the longer compound occurs. It may 
seem a bit odd for a Christian church (ekk/ésia) to be termed 
sunagogé, but James is writing to Jewish Christians and 
this is another incidental argument for the early date. 
Epiphanius (Haer. XXX. 18) states that the Ebionites call 
their church sunagogé, not ekklésia. In the fourth century 
an inscription has sunagdgé for the meeting-house of certain 
Christians. 4 man with a gold ring (anér chrusodaktulios). 
“A gold-fingered man,” “wearing a gold ring.” The word 
occurs nowhere else, but Lucian has chrusocheir (gold- 
handed) and Epictetus has chrusous daktulious (golden seal- 
rings). ‘‘Hannibal, after the battle of Cannae, sent as a 
great trophy to Carthage, three bushels of gold-rings from 
the fingers of Roman knights slain in battle” (Vincent). 
In fine clothing (en esthéti lamprai). “In bright (brilliant) 
clothing” as in Luke 23:11; Acts 10:30; Rev. 18:41. In 
contrast with “‘vile clothing” (en rupardi esthéti), “new 
glossy clothes and old shabby clothes” (Hort). Ruparos 
(late word from rupos, filth, I Pet. 3:21) means filthy, dirty. 
In N.T. only here and Rev. 22:11 (filthy). Poor man 
(ptochos). Beggarly mendicant (Matt. 19:21), the opposite 
of plousios (rich). | 

3. And ye have regard to (epiblepséte de epi). First aorist 
active subjunctive (still with ean of verse 2) of epiblepéo, 
followed by repeated preposition epi, to gaze upon, old com- 
pound, in N.T. only here and Luke 1:48; 9:38. Weareth 
(phorounta). ‘‘Wearing,” present active participle of the 
old frequentative verb phored (from pherd), to bear con- 
stantly, to wear (Matt. 11:8). Note repeated article tén 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 29 


(the) with esthéta pointing to verse 2. And say (kai eipéte). 
Continuing tne third-class condition with ean and second 
aorist active subjunctive of eipon. Sit thou here in a good 
place (su kathou hide kalés). Emphatic position of su, ‘Do 
thou sit here in a good place.” Present middle imperative 
of kathémai to sit for the literary kathéso. See Matt. 23:6 
for the first seats in the synagogue (places of honour). And 
ye say to the poor man (kai toi ptochoi eipéte). Third class 
condition with ean continued as before (eipéte). Note article 
Oi pointing to verse 2. Stand thou there (su stéthi ekei). 
Second aorist (intransitive) active imperative of hist@mi, to 
place. Ingressive aorist, Take a stand. Su emphatic again. 
The MSS. vary in the position of ekei (there). Or sit under 
my footstool (@ kathou hupo to hupopodion mou). For this 
use of hupo “down against” or “down beside” see Ex. 
19:17 hupo to oros (“at the foot of the mountain”) and 
hupo se (“at thy feet”) (Deut. 33:3). Conquerors often 
placed their feet on the necks of the victims (Luke 20:43). 

4. Are ye not divided in your own mind? (ou diekrithéte en 
heautois;). First aorist (gnomic) passive indicative of diak- 
rind, to separate, conclusion of the third-class condition 
(future) in a rhetorical question in the gnomic aorist (as if 
past) with ow expecting an affirmative answer. For this 
idiom (gnomic aorist) in a conclusion of the third-class con- 
dition see I Cor. 7:28. “Were ye not divided in (among) 
yourselves?” Cf.1:6; Matt. 21:21. Fudges with evil thoughts 
(kritait dialogismon poneron). Descriptive genitive as in 
1:25. Dialogismos is an old word for reasoning (Rom. 1:21). 
Reasoning is not necessarily evil, but see Matt. 15:19 
(ponéroi) and Mark 7:21 (kakoi) for evil reasonings, and I 
Tim. 2:8 without an adjective. See James 1:8 and 4:8 for 
dipsuchos. ‘They are guilty of partiality (a divided mind) 
as between the two strangers. 

5. Did not God choose? (ouch ho theos exelexato;). Affirma- 
tive answer expected. First aorist middle (indirect, God 


30 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


chose for himself) indicative of ek/egd, the very form used 
by Paul three times of God’s choice in I Cor. 1:27f. 4s to 
the world (toi kosmoi). ‘The ethical dative of interest, as 
the world looks at it as in Acts 7:20; I Cor. 1:18; II Cor. 
10:4; James 4:4. By the use of the article (the poor) James 
does not affirm that God chose all the poor, but only that 
he did choose poor people (Matt. 10:23-26; I Cor. 1:26-28). 
Rich in faith (plousious en pistei). Rich because of their 
faith. As he has shown in t:of. Which he promised (hés 
epeggeilato). Genitive of the accusative relative hén at- 
tracted to the case of the antecedent dasileias (the Messianic 
kingdom), the same verb and idea already in 1:12 (epég- 
geilato). Cf. the beatitude of Jesus in Matt. 5:3 for the 
poor in spirit. 

6. But ye have dishonoured the poor man (humeis de éti- 
masate ton ptochon). First aorist active indicative of ati- 
mazo, old verb from atimos, dishonoured (Matt. 13:57). In 
the act of partiality pictured in 2:3. Oppress you (kata- 
dunasteuousin humon). Not very common compound (kata- 
dunasteud, present active indicative, from kata and dunastés, 
potentate, Luke 1:52), used of the devil in Acts 10-38 (only 
other N.T. example). Examples in papyri of harsh treat- 
ment by men in authority. Already poor Christians are 
feeling pressure from rich Jews as overlords. Drag you 
(helkousin humas). Old and vigorous word for violent treat- 
ment, as of Paul in Acts 16:19; 21:30. Cf. such violence in 
Luke 12:58; Acts 8:3. Before the judgment-seats (eis kriteria). 
“To courts of justice” as in I Cor. 6:2, 4 (only other N.T. 
examples). Common in the papyri in this sense. From 
kriné to judge, krités (judge), place where judgment is given 

7. Blaspheme (blasphémousin). Present active indicative 
of common verb dlasphémed (from blasphémos, speaking evil, 
blax or blapté and phémé), as in Luke 22:65. The honourable 
name (to kalon onoma). ‘‘The beautiful name.” By the 
which ye were called (to epikléthen eph’ humas). “The one 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 31 


called upon you” (first aorist passive articular participle 
of epikaled, to put a name upon, to give a surname to, as 
Acts 10:18). What name’ is that? Almost certainly the 
name of Christ as we see it in Acts 11:26; 26:28; I Pet. 
4:14, 16. It was blasphemy to speak against Christ as some 
Jews and Gentiles were doing (Acts 13:45; 18:6; 26:11; I 
Corena:3; Tims 4 319) Cf Acts 16:17: 

8. Howbe-t (mentoi). Probably not adversative here, but 
simply confirmatory, “if now,” “if indeed,” “‘if really.” 
Common in Xenophon in this sense. See the contrast (de) 
in verse 9. If ye fulfil (ei teleite). Condition of first class, 
assumed as true with ei and present active indicative of 
teled, old verb, to bring to completion, occurring in Rom. 
2:27 also with nomos (law). Jesus used plérod in Matt. 
4:17. James has ¢éred in 2:10. The royal law (nomon basil- 
ikon). Old adjective for royal, regal (from dasileus king), 
as of an officer (John 4:46). But why applied to nomos? 
The Romans had a phrase, /ex regia, which came from the 
king when they had kings. The absence of the article is 
common with nomos (4:11). It can mean a law fit to guide 
a king, or such as a king would choose, or even the king of 
laws. Jesus had said that on the law of love hang all the 
law and the prophets (Matt. 22:40), and he had given the 
Golden Rule as the substance of the Law and the prophets 
(Matt. 7:12). This is probably the royal law which is 
violated by partiality (James 2:3). It is in accord with the 
Scripture quoted here (Lev. 19:18) and ratified by Jesus 
(Luke 10:28). © 

9. But if ye have respect of persons (ei de prosopolempteite). 
Condition of first class by contrast with that in verse 8. 
For this verb (present active indicative), formed from pro- 
sopon lamband, here alone in the N.T., see in 2:1. A direct 
reference to the partiality there pictured. Ye commit sin 
(hamartian ergazesthe). ““Ye work asin.” A serious charge, 
apparently, for what was regarded as a trifling fault. See 


32 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Matt. 7:23, hoi ergazomenoi ten anomian (ye that work 
iniquity), an apparent reminiscence of the words of Jesus 
there (from Ps. 6:8). Being convicted (elegchomenoi). Pres- 
ent passive participle of elegchd, to convict by proof of guilt 
(John 3:20; 8:9, 46; I Cor. 14:24). 4s transgressors (hos 
parabatai). For this word from parabaind, to step across, 
to transgress, see Gal. 2:18; Rom. 2:25, 27. See this very 
sin of partiality condemned in Lev. 19:15; Deut. 1:17; 16:19. 
To the law and to the testimony. 

10. Whosoever shall keep (hostis téréséi). Indefinite rela- 
tive clause with Aostis and aorist active subjunctive of téred, 
old verb, to guard (from /éros guarding), as in Matt. 27:36, 
without am (though often used, but only one example of 
modal ean =an in James, viz., 4:4). This modal an (ean) 
merely interprets the sentence as either more indefinite or 
more definite (Robertson, Grammar, p. 957f.). And yet 
stumble in one point (ptaiséi de en heni). First aorist active 
subjunctive also of ptaid, old verb, to trip, as in 3:2 and 
Rom. 11:11. “It is incipient falling” (Hort). He is become 
(gegonen). Second perfect indicative of ginomai, “‘he has 
become” by that one stumble. Guilty of all (panton enochos). 
Genitive of the crime with enochos, old adjective from enechd 
(to hold on or in), held in, as in Mark 3:29. This is law. 
To be a lawbreaker one does not have to violate all the laws, 
but he must keep all the law (Aolon ton nomon) to be a law- 
abiding citizen, even laws that one does not like. See Matt. 
5:18f. for this same principle. There is Talmudic parallel: 
“Tf a man do all, but omit one, he is guilty for all and each.” 
This is a pertinent principle also for those who try to save 
themselves. But James is urging obedience to all God’s 
laws. 

11. He that said (ho eipon)—said also (eipen kai). The 
unity of the law lies in the Lawgiver who spoke both pro- 
hibitions (mé and the aorist active subjunctive in each one, 
moicheuséis, phoneuséis). The order here is that of B in 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 33 


Ex. 20 (Luke 18:20; Rom. 13:9), but not in Matt. 5:21, 27 
(with ou and future indicative). Now if thou dost not com- 
mit adultery, but killest (ei de ou moicheueis, phoneueis de). 
Condition of first class with ou (not mé) because of the con- 
trast with de, whereas ei mé would mean ‘“‘unless,” a differ- 
ent idea. So ou in 1:23. J transgressor of the law (parabatés 
nomou) as in verse 9. Murder springs out of anger (Matt. 
§:21-26). People free from fleshly sins have often “made 
their condemnation of fleshly sins an excuse for indulgence 
towards spiritual sins” (Hort). 

12. So speak ye, and so do (houtos laleite kai houtos poieite). 
Present active imperatives as a habit. For the combination 
see I:19-21 contrasted with 1:22-25, and 1:26 with 1:27. 
By a law of liberty (dia nomou eleutherias). ‘The law pic- 
tured in 1:25, but law, after all, not individual caprice of 
“personal liberty.” See Rom. 2:12 for this same use of 
dia with krind in the sense of accompaniment as in Rom. 
2:27; 4:11; 14:20. “‘Under the law of liberty.” 

13. Without mercy (aneleos). Found here only save a 
doubtful papyrus example (aze/eds) for the vernacular ani~ 
leds and the Attic anéleés. For this principle of requital 
see Matt. 5:7; 6:14; 7:1f.; 18:33. Glorieth against (katakau- 
chatai). Present middle indicative of the old compound verb 
katakauchaomai, to exult over (down), in N.T. only here, 
3:14; Rom. 11:18. Only mercy can triumph over justice 
with God and men. ‘Mercy is clothed with the divine glory 
and stands by the throne of God” (Chrysostom). See Rom. 
8:31-39; Matt. 9:13; 12:7. 

14. What doth it profit? (ti ophelos;). Rhetorical question, 
almost of impatience. Old word from ophellé, to increase, 
in N.T. only here, verse 16, and I Cor. 15:32. “Ti ophelos 
was a common expression in the vivacious style of a moral 
diatribe”’ (Ropes). Jf @ man say (ean legéi tis). Condition 
of third class with ean and the present active subjunctive 
of lego, “if one keep on saying.” He hath faith (pistin 


34 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


echein). Infinitive in indirect assertion after /egéi. But have 
not works (erga de mé echéi). Third-class condition continued, 
“but keeps on not having (mé and present active subjunc- 
tive echéi) works.” It is the spurious claim to faith that 
James here condemns. Can that faith save him? (mé dunatai 
hé pistis sdsai auton;). Negative answer expected (mé). 
Effective aorist active infinitive sdsai (from 5020). The 
article @ here is almost demonstrative in force as it is in 
origin, referring to the claim of faith without works just 
made. 

15. If a brother or sister be naked (ean adelphos é adelphé 
gumnoi huparchosin). Condition again of third class (sup- 
posable case) with ean and present active subjunctive of 
huparchd, to exist, in the plural though @ (or) is used and 
not kai (and). Hence gumnoi is masculine plural in the 
predicate nominative. It does not here mean absolutely 
naked, but without sufficient clothing as in Matt. 25:36ff.; 
John 21:7; Acts 19:16. In lack of daily food (letpomenoi 
tés ephémerou trophés). Present passive participle of /eipd 
and ablative case trophés like leipetai sophias (1:5). The 
old adjective ephémeros (ho epi hémeran On, that which is 
for a day) occurs here only in the N.T., though ephémeria 
(daily routine) is found in Luke 1:5, 8. This phrase occurs 
in Diodorus, but not in LXX. 

16. And one of you say unto them (eipéi de tis autois ex 
humon). Third-class condition again continued from verse 
15 with second aorist active subjunctive eipéi. Go in peace 
(hupagete en eirénéi). Present active imperative of hupago. 
Common Jewish farewell (Judges 18:6; I Sam. 1:17; 20:42; 
II Sam. 15:9). Used by Jesus (Mark 5:34; Luke 7:50). 
Be ye warmed and filled (thermainesthe kat chortazesthe). 
Present imperative either middle (direct) or passive. We 
have thermainomai as a direct middle in John 18:18 (were 
warming themselves) and that makes good sense here: 
“Warm yourselves.” Chortazd was originally used for pas- 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 35 


turing cattle, but came to be used of men also as here. 
“Feed yourselves” (if middle, as is likely). Instead of warm 
clothes and satisfying food they get only empty words to 
look out for themselves. And yet ye give not (mé dote de). 
Third-class condition with de (and yet) and mé and the 
second aorist active subjunctive of diddmi, to give, cold 
deeds with warm words. . The things needful to the body (ta 
epitédeia tou sdmatos). ‘‘The necessities of the body” (the 
necessaries of life). Old adjective from adverb epitédes 
(enough), only herein N.T. What doth it profit? (ti ophelos;). 
As in verse 14 and here the conclusion (apodosis) of the long 
condition begun in verse 15. 

17. If it have not works (ean mé echéi erga). Another con- 
dition of the third class with eam and mé and the present 
active subjunctive of echd, “‘if it keep on not having works.” 
In itself (kath? heauten). In and of itself (according to it- 
self), inwardly and outwardly dead (nekra). Same idiom 
in Acts 28:16; Rom. 14:22. It is a dead faith. 

18. Yea, a man will say (all erei tis). Future active of 
eipon. But all’ here is almost certainly adversative (But 
someone will say), not confirmatory. James introduces an 
imaginary objector who speaks one sentence: “Thou hast 
faith and I have works” (Su pistin echeis kagd erga echo). 
Then James answers this objector. The objector can be 
regarded as asking a short question: “Hast thou faith?” 
In that case James replies: ““I have works also.” Show me 
thy faith apart from thy works (deixon moi ten pistin sou 
choris ton ergon). This is the reply of James to the objector. 
First aorist active imperative of deiknumi, tense of urgency. 
The point lies in choris, which means not “without,” but 
“apart from,” as in Heb. 11:6 (with the ablative case), ‘‘the 
works that properly belong to it and should characterise it” 
(Hort). James challenges the objector to do this. dnd I 
by my works will shew thee my faith (kagd soi detxo ek ton 
ergin mou tén pistin). It is not faith or works, but proof 


36 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


of real faith (live faith vs. dead faith). The mere profession 
of faith with no works or profession of faith shown to be 
alive by works. This is the alternative clearly stated. Note 
pistin (faith) in both cases. James is not here discussing 
“‘works”’ (ceremonial works) as a means of salvation as 
Paul in Gal. 3 and Rom. 4, but works as proof of faith. 

19. Thou believest that God is one (su pisteueis hoti heis 
theos estin). James goes on with his reply and takes up 
mere creed apart from works, belief that God exists (there 
is one God), a fundamental doctrine, but that is not belief 
or trust in God. It may be mere creed. Thou doest well 
(kalos poieis). That is good as far as it goes, which is not 
far. The demons also believe (kai ta daimonia pisteuousin). 
They go that far (the same verb pisteud). They never 
doubt the fact of God’s existence. And shudder (kai phris- 
sousin). Present active indicative of phrissd, old onomato- 
poetic verb to bristle up, to shudder, only here in N.T. 
Like Latin horreo (horror, standing of the hair on end with 
terror). The demons do more than believe a fact. They 
shudder at it. 

20. But wilt thou know? (theleis de gnonai?). “But dost 
thou wish to know?” Ingressive aorist active infinitive of 
ginosko (come to know). James here introduces a new argu- 
ment like Rom. 13:3. O vain man (6 anthrope kene). Goes 
on with the singular objector and demolishes him. For 
“empty” (deficient) Paul uses aphron (fool) in I Cor. 15:36 
and just anthrope in Rom. 2:1; 9:20. Barren (arge). See 
II Pet. 1:8 (not idle nor unfruitful) and Matt. 12:36, but 
Hort urges “inactive” as the idea here, like money with no 
interest and land with no crops. 

21. Justified by works (ex ergin edikaiothé). First aorist 
passive indicative of dikaiod (see Galatians and Romans for 
this verb, to declare righteous, to set right) in a question 
with ouk expecting an affirmative answer. This is the phrase 
that is often held to be flatly opposed to Paul’s statement in 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 37 


Rom. 4:1-5, where Paul pointedly says that it was the faith 
of Abraham (Rom. 4:9) that was reckoned to Abraham for 
righteousness, not his works. But Paul is talking about the 
faith of Abraham before his circumcision (4:10) as the basis 
of his being set right with God, which faith is symbolized in 
the circumcision. James makes plain his meaning also. In 
that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar (anenegkas 
Isaak ton huion autou epi to thusiasterion). They use the 
same words, but they are talking of different acts. James 
points to the offering (anenegkas second aorist—with first 
aorist ending—active participle of anaphero) of Isaac on the 
altar (Gen. 22:16f.) as proof of the faith that Abraham 
already had. Paul discusses Abraham’s faith as the basis 
of his justification, that and not his circumcision. There is 
no contradiction at all between James and Paul. Neither 
is answering the other. Paul may or may not have seen 
the Epistle of James, who stood by him loyally in the Con- » 
ference in Jerusalem (Acts 15 and Gal. 2). 

22. Thou seest (blepeis). Obvious enough with any eyes 
to see. This may be a question, seest thou? Wrought with 
(sunérgei). Imperfect active of sunerged, old verb for which 
see Rom. 8:28. Followed by associative-instrumental case 
ergois. Faith codperated with the deed of offering up Isaac. 
Was made perfect (eteleiothé). First aorist passive indica- 
tive of teleiod, to carry to the end, to complete like love in 
I John 4:18. See James 1:4 for teleion ergon. 

23. Was fulfilled (eplerothé). First aorist passive indica- 
tive of plérod, the usual verb for fulfilling Scripture. So 
James quotes Gen. 15:6 as proving his point in verse 21 
that Abraham had works with his faith, the very same pas- 
sage that Paul quotes in Rom. 4:3 to show that Abraham's 
faith preceded his circumcision and was the basis of his 
justification. And both James and Paul are right, each to 
illustrate a different point. And he was called the friend of 
God (kai philos theou ekléthé). First aorist passive indicative 


38 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


of kal@o. Not a part of the Scripture quoted. Philo calls 
Abraham the friend of God and ‘see Fubilees 19:9; 30:20. 
The Arabs today speak of Abraham as God’s friend. ‘It 
was evidently a common description before James used ‘it, 
as in Is. 41:8; II Chron. 20:7. 

24. Ye see (horate). Present indicative active of horaé. 
Now he uses the plural again as in 2:14. Is justified (dikai- 
outai). Present passive indicative of dikaiod, here not “‘is 
made righteous,” but “‘is shown to be righteous.” James 
is discussing the proof of faith, not the initial act of being 
set right with God (Paul’s idea in Rom. 4:1-10). And not 
only by faith (kai ouk ek pisteds monon). This phrase clears 
up the meaning of James. Faith (live faith) is what we must 
all have (2:18), only it must shew itself also in deeds as 
Abraham’s did. 

25. Rahab the harlot (Raab hé porné). Wer vicious life 
she left behind, but the name clung to her always. For our 
purposes the argument of James may seem stronger with- 
out the example of Rahab (Josh. 2:1-21, 6:17, 22-25; Matt. 
1:5; Heb. 11:31). It is even said in Jewish Midrash that 
Rahab married Joshua‘and became an ancestor of Jeremiah 
and Ezekiel. In that she received (hupodexamené).: First 
aorist middle participle of hupodechomai, to welcome. The 
messengers (tous aggelous). Original meaning of aggelos 
(Matt. 11:10). In Heb. 11:31 we have kataskopous (spies, 
scouts). Sent out (ekbalousa). Second aorist active par- 
ticiple of ekballé, to hurl out. Another way (heterai hoddi). 
“By another way” (instrumental case), by a window in- 
stead of a door (Josh. 2:15f.). 

26. Apart from the spirit (choris pneumatos). ‘Apart from 
breath” (the breath of life). It is not easy to tell when one 
is dead, but the absence of a sign of breath on a glass before 
the mouth and nose is proof of death. Startling picture of 
dead faith in our churches and church members with only 
a name to live (Rev. 3:2). 


CHAPTER III 


1. Be not many teachers (mé polloi didaskaloi ginesthe). 
Prohibition with mé and present middle imperative of gino- 
mai. ‘Stop becoming many teachers” (so many of you). 
There is thus a clear complaint that too many of the Jewish 
Christians were attempting to teach what they did not 
clearly comprehend. There was a call for wise teachers 
(verses 13f.), not for foolish ones. This soon became an. 
acute question, as one can see in I Cor. 12 to14. They were 
not all teachers (I Cor. 12:28f.; 14:26). The teacher is 
here treated as the wise man (3:13-18) as he ought to be. 
The rabbi was the teacher (Matt. 23:7f.; John 1:38; 3:10; 
20:16). ‘Teachers occupied an honourable position among 
the Christians (Eph. 4:11; Acts 13:1). James counts him- 
self a teacher (we shall receive, 3:1) and this discussion is 
linked on with 1:19-27. Teachers are necessary, but in- 
competent and unworthy ones do much harm. Heavier 
judgment (meizon krima). “Greater sentence.” See Mark 
12:40 and Luke 20:47 for perrisoteron krima (the sentence 
from the judge, Rom. 13:2). The reason is obvious. The 
pretence of knowledge adds to the teacher’s responsibility 
and condemnation. 

2. In many things (polla). Accusative neuter plural either 
cognate with piaiomen or accusative of general reference. 
On ptaiomen (stumble) see on 2:10. James includes him- 
self in this list of stumblers. Jf not (ei-ou). Condition of 
first class with ou (not mé) negativing the verb ptaiei. In 
word (en logoi). In speech. The teacher uses his tongue 
constantly and so is in particular peril on this score. The 
same (houtos). “This one” (not ho autos the same). 4 
perfect man (teleios anér). “A perfect husband” also, for 

39 


40 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


anér is husband as well as man in distinction from woman 
(guné). The wife is at liberty to test her husband by this 
rule of the tongue. To bridle the whole body also (chalina- 
gogesai kai holon to soma). See 1:26 for this rare verb ap- 
plied to the tongue (g/éssan). Here the same metaphor is 
used and shown to apply to the whole body as horses are 
led by the mouth. The man follows his own mouth whether 
he controls the bridle therein (1:26) or someone else holds 
the reins. James apparently means that the man who 
bridles his tongue does not stumble in speech and is able 
also to control his whole body with all its passions. See 
Titus 1:11 about stopping people’s mouths (epistomizé). 

— 3. If we put (ei ballomen). Condition of the first class 
assumed as true. The horses’ bridles (tin hippon tous chalin- 
ous). Hippon (genitive plural of hippos, horse, old word, 
in N.T. only here except in the Apocalypse), put first be- 
cause the first of the several illustrations of the power and 
the peril of the tongue. This is the only N.T. example 
of chalinos, old word for bridle (from chalaé to slacken, 
let down), except Rev. 14:20. That they may obey us (eis to 
petthesthat autous hémin). Present middle infinitive of 
peitho with eis to as a purpose clause with the dative hémin 
after peithesthai and autous the accusative of general refer- 
ence. We turn about (metagomen). Present active indica- 
tive of metago, late compound to change the direction (meta, 
ago), to guide, in N.T. only here and verse 4. The body 
of the horse follows his mouth, guided by the bridle. 

4. The ships also (kai ta ploia). Old word from pled, to 
sail (Matt. 4:21). Another metaphor like “horses” (Aippoi). 
“There is more imagery drawn from mere natural phe- 
nomena in the one short Epistle of James than in all St. 
Paul’s epistles put together” (Howson). Though they are 
$o great (télikauta onta). Concessive participle of eimi. The 
quantitative pronoun /é/ikoutos occurs in the N.T. only here, 
II Cor. 1:10; Heb. 2:3; Rev. 16:18. If James had only seen 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 41 


‘the modern mammoth ships. But the ship on which Paul 
went to Malta carried 276 persons (Acts 27:37). And are 
driven (kai elaunomena). Present passive participle of ela- 
und, old verb, in this sense (II Pet. 2:17) for rowing (Mark 
6:48; John 6:19). Rough (skléron). Old adjective (from 
skelld, to dry up), harsh, stiff, hard (Matt. 25:24). Are yet 
turned (metagetai). Present passive indicative of the same 
verb, metagé, in verse 3. James is fond of repeating words 
(1:13f.; 2:14, 16; 2:21, 25). By @ very small rudder (hupo 
elachistou pédaliou). For the use of hupo (under) with 
things see Luke 8:14; II Pet. 2:7. There is possibly per- 
sonification in the use of hupo for agency in James 1:14; 
2:9; Col. 2:18. Pédaliou (from pédon, the blade of an oar): 
is an old word, in N.T. only here and Acts 27:40. Elachistau 
is the elative superlative as in I Cor. 4:3 (from the Epic 
elachus for mikros). The impulse (hé hormé). Old word for 
rapid, violent motion, here of the hand that worked the 
rudder, in N.T. only here and Acts 14:5 (rush or onset of 
the people). Of the steersman (tou euthunontos). Present 
active genitive articular participle of euthund, old verb, to 
make straight (from euthus, straight, level, Mark 1:3), in 
N.T. only here and John 1:23. Used also of the shepherd, 
the charioteer, and today it would apply to the chauffeur. 
“The twin figure of the control of horse and of ship are 
frequently found together in later Greek writers” (Ropes). 
As in Plutarch and Philo. Wéilleth (bouletai). Present mid- 
dle indicative of Zoulomai, common verb to will. Here in- 
tention of the steersman lies back of the impact of the hand 
on the rudder. 

5. A little member (mikron melos). Melos is old and com- 
mon word for members of the human body (I Cor, 12:12, 
etc.; Rom. 6:13, etc.). Boasteth great things (megala auchet). 
Present active indicative of auched, old verb, here only in 
N.T. The best MSS. here separate megala from aucheo, 
though megalauched does occur in AEschylus, Plato, etc. 


42 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Megala is in contrast with mikron. How much—how small 
(héelikon—hélikén). The same relative form for two indirect 
questions together, “‘What-sized fire kindles what-sized for- 
est?” For double interrogatives see Mark 15:24. The verb 
anaptei is present active indicative of anapfo, to set fire to, 
to kindle (Luke 12:49, only other N.T. example except some 
MSS. in Acts 28:2). Hulén is accusative case, object of 
anaptei, and occurs here only in N.T., though old word for 
forest, wood. Forest fires were common in ancient times 
as now, and were usually caused by small sparks carelessly 
thrown. 

6. The tongue is a fire (hé glossa pur). So necessarily 
since there is no article with pur (apparently same word as 
German feuer, Latin purus, English pure, fire). This meta- 
phor of fire is applied to the tongue in Prov. 16:27; 26:18-22; 
Sirach 28:22. The world of iniquity (ho kosmos tés adikias). 
A difficult phrase, impossible to understand according to 
Ropes as it stands. If the comma is put after pur instead 
of after adikias, then the phrase may be the predicate with 
kathistatai (present passive indicative of kathistémi, ‘is con- 
stituted,” or the present middle “presents itself”). Even 
so, kosmos remains a difficulty, whether it means the “‘or- 
nament” (I Pet. 3:3) or “evil world” (James 1:27) or just 
“world” in the sense of widespread power for evil. The 
genitive adikias is probably descriptive (or qualitative). 
Clearly James means to say that the tongue can play havoc 
in the members of the human body. Which defileth the whole 
body (hé spilousa holon to soma). Present active participle 
of spilod late Koiné, verb, to stain from spilos (spot, also 
late word, in N.T. only in Eph. 5:27; II Pet. 2:13), in N.T. 
only here and Jude 23. Cf. 1:27 aspilon (unspotted). Set- 
teth on fire (phlogizousa). Present active participle of phlo- 
giz0, old verb, to set on fire, to ignite, from phlox (flame), 
in N.T. only in this verse. See anaptei (verse 5). The 
wheel of nature (ton trochon geneseds). Old word for wheel 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 43 


(from ¢rechd, to run), only here in N.T. “One of the hard- 
est passages in the Bible” (Hort). To what does trochon 
refer? For geneseds see 1:23 apparently in the same sense. 
Vincent suggests ‘‘the wheel of birth” (cf. Matt. 1:1, 18). 
The ancient writers often use this same phrase (or kuk/los, 
cycle, in place of ¢rochos), but either in a physiological or a 
philosophical sense. James may have caught the metaphor 
from the current use, but certainly he has no such Orphic 
or Pythagorean doctrine of the transmigration of souls, “the 
unending round of death and rebirth” (Ropes). The wheel 
of life may be considered either in motion or standing stili, 
though setting on fire implies motion. There is no reference 
to the zodiac. And is set on fire by hell (kai phlogizomené 
hupo gehennés). Present passive participle of phlogizd, giv- 
ing the continual source of the fire in the tongue. For the 
metaphor of fire with gehenna see Matt. 5:22. 

7. Kind (phusis). Old word from phué, order of nature 
(Rom. 1:26), here of all animals and man, in II Pet. 1:4 
of God and redeemed men. Of beasts (thérion). Old word 
diminutive from thér and so “‘little beasts” originally, then 
wild animals in general (Mark 1:13), or quadrupeds as here. 
These four classes of animals come from Gen. g:2f. Birds 
(peteindn). Old word for flying animals (from petomaz, to 
fly), as in Matt. 13:4. Creeping things (herpeton). Old 
word from herpd, to crawl (Latin serpo), hence serpents. 
Things in the sea (enalion). Old adjective (en, hals, sea, 
salt) in the sea, here only in N.T. The four groups are 
put in two pairs here by the use of ¢e kai with the first two 
and the second two. See a different classification in Acts 
10:12; 11:6. Is tamed (damazetai). Present passive indica- 
tive of damazé, old verb kin to Latin dominus and English 
tame, in N.T. only in this passage and Mark 5:4. The 
present tense gives the general picture of the continuous 
process through the ages of man’s lordship over the animals 
as stated in Gen. 1:28. Hath been tamed (dedamastai). Per- 


44 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


fect passive indicative of the same verb, repeated to present 
the state of conquest in some cases (domestic animals, for 
instance). By mankind (téi phusei tei anthropinéi). Instru- 
mental case with repeated article and repetition also of 
phusis, “by the nature the human.” For anthropinos see 
Act 1722: 

8. No one (oudeis). Especially his own tongue and by 
himself, but one has the help of the Holy Spirit. 4 restless 
evil (akatastaton kakon). Correct reading, not akatascheton, 
for which see 1:8. The tongue is evil when set on fire by 
hell, not evil necessarily. Full of deadly poison (mesté iou 
thanatéphorou). Feminine adjective agreeing with g/dssa, 
not with kakon (neuter). Jou (poison here, as in Rom. 
3:13, but rust in §:3, only N.T. examples), old word. Geni- 
tive case after mesté (full of). Thanat@phorou, old compound 
adjective (from thanatos, death, pherd, to bear or bring), 
death-bringing. Here only in N.T. Like the restless death- 
bringing tongue of the asp before it strikes. 

9. Therewith (en autzi). This instrumental use of em is 
not merely Hebraistic, but appears in late Koiné writers 
(Moulton, Pro/., pp. 11f., 61f.). See also Rom. 15:6. We 
bless (eulogoumen). Present active indicative of euloged, old 
verb from eulogos (a good word, eu, Jogos), as in Luke 1:64 
of God. “This is the highest function of speech” (Hort). 
The Lord and Father (ton kurion kai patera). Both terms 
applied to God. Curse we (katardmetha). Present middle 
indicative of the old compound verb kataraomai, to curse 
(from katara a curse), as in Luke 6:28. Which are made 
after the likeness of God (tous kath’ homoidsin theou gegonotas). 
Second perfect articular participle of ginomai and homoidsis, 
old word from homoiod (to make like), making like, here only 
in N.T. (from Gen. 1:26; 9:6), the usual word being homo- 
16ma, resemblance (Phil. 2:7). It is this image of God which 
sets man above the beasts. Cf. II Cor. 3:18. 

10. Ought not (ou chre). The only use of this old im- 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 45 


personal verb (from chrad) in the N.T. It is more like 
prepei (it is appropriate) than dei (it is necessary). It is 
a moral incongruity for blessing and cursing to come out 
of the same mouth. So to be (houtos ginesthai). “So to 
keep on happening,” not just “to be,” present middle in- 
finitive of ginomai. . 

11. The fountain (hé pége). Old word for spring (John 
4:14). Opening (opés). Old word for fissure in the earth, 
in N.T. only here and Heb. 11:38 (caves). Send forth 
(ruei). Present active indicative of drud, old verb, to 
bubble up, to gush forth, here only in N.T. The use of 
meti shows that a negative answer is expected in this rhetor 
ical question. The sweet and the bitter (to gluku kai to pikron). 
Cognate accusatives with brucei. Separate articles to dis- 
tinguish sharply the two things. The neuter singular artic- 
ular adjective is a common way of presenting a quality. 
Glukus is an old adjective (in N.T. only here and Rev. 
10:9f.), the opposite of pikron (from old root, to cut, to 
prick), in N.T. only here and verse 14 (sharp, harsh). 

12. Can? (mé dunatai;). Negative answer expected. See 
the same metaphor in Matt. 7:16f. Fig-tree (suké). Old 
and common word (Matt. 21:10f.). Figs (suka). Ripe 
fruit of hé suké. Olives (elaias). Elsewhere in the N.T. 
for olive-trees as Matt. 21:1. Vine (ampelos). Old word 
(Matt. 26:29). Salt water (halukon). Old adjective from 
hals (halas salt), here only in N.T. 

13. Who (Tis). Rhetorical interrogative like Luke 11:11. 
Common in Paul and characteristic of the diatribe. James 
here returns to the standpoint of verse 1 about many teach- 
ers. Speech and wisdom are both liable to abuse (I Cor. 
1:5, 173 2:1-3:20). Wise and understanding (sophos kat 
epistemon). Sophos is used for the practical teacher (verse 
1), epistemon (old word from epistamai, here only in N.T.) 
for an expert, a skilled and scientific person with a tone of 
superiority. In Deut. 1:13, 15; 4:6, the two terms are prac- 


46 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


tically synonyms. Let him shew (deixaté). First aorist ac- 
tive imperative of deiknumi, old verb to show. As about 
faith in 2:18. Emphatic position of this verb. By his good 
life (ek tes kalés anastrophés). For this literary Koiné word 
from anastrephomai (walk, conduct) see Gal. 1:13. Actions 
speak louder than words even in the case of the professional 
wise man. Cf. I Pet. 1:15. In meekness of wisdom (en 
prauteti sophias). As in 1:21 of the listener, so here of the 
teacher. Cf. Matt. 5:5; 11:29 and Zach. 9:9 of King Mes- 
siah quoted in Matt. 21:5. Startling combination. 

14. Bitter jealousy (zélon pikron). Zélos occurs in N.T. 
in good sense (John 2:17) and bad sense (Acts 5:17). Pride 
of knowledge is evil (I Cor. 8:1) and leaves a bitter taste. 
See “root of bitterness” in Heb. 12:14 (cf. Eph. 4:31). 
This is a condition of the first class. Faction (erithian). 
wate word, from erithos (hireling, from eritheud to spin wool), 
a pushing forward for personal ends, partisanship, as in 
Phil. 1:16. In your heart (en tei kardiai humén). The real 
fountain (pégé, verse 11). Glory not (mé katakauchasthe). 
Present middle imperative of katakauchaomai, for which see 
2:13. Wisdom is essential for the teacher. Boasting ar- 
rogance disproves the possession of wisdom. Lie not against 
the truth (pseudesthe kata tés alétheias). Present middle im- 
perative of pseudomai, old verb, to play false, with mé car- 
ried over. Lying against the truth is futile. By your con- 
duct do not belie the truth which you teach; a solemn and 
needed lesson. Cf. Rom. 1:18f., 2:18, 20. 

15. This wisdom (hauté hé sophia). All talk and disproved 
by the life, counterfeit wisdom, not real wisdom (1:5; 3:17). 
Coming down from above (katerchomené anothen). As in 135, 
17. All true wisdom comes from God. Earthly (epigeios). 
Old adjective, on earth (epi, g@), as in John 3:12, then with 
earthly limitations (Phil. 3:19), as here. Sensual (psuchiké). 
Old adjective, belonging to the psuché, the sensuous or ani- 
mal life (I Cor. 2:14 and here). Devilish (daimoniddés). 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 47 


Late adjective from daimonion (demon) and so demoniacal 
or demon-like, here only in N.T. 

16. Confusion (akatastasia). Late word (from akatasta- 
tos, 1:8; 3:8), a state of disorder (I Cor. 14:33). Vile 
(phaulon). Kin to German faul, first slight, ordinary, then 
bad. The steps are cheap, paltry, evil. Opposed to agatha 
(good) in John 5:39. . 

17. First pure (proton men hagné). First in rank and 
time. Hagnos is from the same root as hagios (holy), old 
adjective, pure from fault, not half-good and half-bad, like 
that above. Then peaceable (epeita eiréniké). Old adjective 
from eirené (peace), loving peace here, bringing peace in 
Heb. 12:11 (only N.T. examples). But clearly great as 
peace is, purity (righteousness) comes before peace and 
peace at any price is not worth the having. Hence Jesus 
spurned the devil’s peace of surrender. Gentle (epieikés). 
Old adjective (from eikos, reasonable, fair), equitable (Phil. 
4:5; I Pet. 2:18). No English word renders it clearly. Easy 
to be entreated (eupeithés). Old adjective (eu, peithomai), 
compliant, approachable. Only herein N.T. Mercy (eleous). 
Practical help (2:13, 16). Good fruits (karpon agathon). 
Kaloi karpoi in Matt. 7:17f. Good deeds the fruit of right- 
eousness (Phil. 1:11). Without variance (adiakritos). Late 
verbal adjective (from alpha privative and diakrinod, to 
distinguish). ‘‘Unhesitating,” not doubting (diakrinomenos) 
like the man in 1:6. Here only in N.T. This wisdom does 
not put a premium on doubt. Without hypocrisy (anu- 
pokritos). Late and rare verbal adjective (alpha privative 
and hupokrino). Not hypocritical, sincere, unfeigned (Rom. 
12:9). 

18. Is sown in peace (en eirénéi speiretai). Present pas- 
sive indicative of speird, to sow. The seed which bears the 
fruit is sown, but James catches up the metaphor of karpos 
(fruit) from verse 17. Only in peace is the fruit of right- 
eousness found. For them that make peace (tois potousin 


48 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


eirénén). Dative case of the articular participle of poied. 
See Eph. 2:15 for this phrase (doing peace), and Col. 1:20 
for eirénopoied, of Christ, and Matt. 5:9 for eirénopoioi 
(peacemakers). Only those who act peaceably are entitled 
to peace. 


CHAPTER 1V 


1. Whence (pothen). This old interrogative adverb (here 
twice) asks for the origin of wars and fights. James is 
full of interrogatives, like all diatribes. Wars (polemoi)— 
Jightings (machai). War (polemos, old word, Matt. 24:6) 
pictures the chronic state or campaign, while maché (also 
old word, II Cor. 7:5) presents the separate conflicts or 
battles in the war. So James covers the whole ground by 
using both words. The origin of a war or of any quarrel 
is sometimes hard to find, but James touches the sore spot 
here. Of your pleasures (ek ton hédonon humon). Old word 
from Aédomai. Ablative case here after ek, “out of your 
sinful, sensual lusts,” the desire to get what one does not 
have and greatly desires. That war (ton strateuomendn). 
Present middle articular participle (ablative case agreeing 
with hedonon) of strateud, to carry on a campaign, here as 
in I Pet. 2:11 of the passions in the human body. James 
seems to be addressing nominal Christians, ““among you” 
(en humin). Modern church disturbances are old enough 
in practice. 

2. Ye lust (epithumeite). Present active indicative of 
epithumed, old word (from epi, thumos, yearning passion for), 
not necessarily evil as clearly not in Luke 22:15 of Christ, 
but usually so in the N.T., as here. Coveting what a man 
or nation does not have is the cause of war according to 
James. Ye kill and covet (phoneuete kai zéloute). Present 
active indicatives of phoneud (old verb from phoneus, mur- 
derer) and zé/od, to desire hotly to possess (I Cor. 12:31). 
It is possible (perhaps probable) that a full stop should 
come after phoneuete (ye kill) as the result of lusting and 
not having. Then we have the second situation: ‘“‘Ye covet 

49 


so WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


and cannot obtain (epituchein, second aorist active infini- 
tive of epitugchand), and (as a result) ye fight and war.” 
This punctuation makes better sense than any other and 
is in harmony with verse 1. Thus also the anticlimax in 
phoneuete and zéloute is avoided. Mayor makes the words 
a hendiadys, “‘ye murderously envy.” Ye have not, because 
ye ask not (ouk echete dia to mé aiteisthai humas). James 
refers again to ouk echete (ye do not have) in verse 2. Such 
sinful lusting will not obtain. “Make the service of God 
your supreme end, and then your desires will be such as 
God can fulfil in answer to your prayer’ (Ropes). Cf. 
Matt. 6:31-33. The reason here is expressed by dia and 
the accusative of the articular present middle infinitive of 
aited, used here of prayer to God as in Matt. 7:7f. Humds 
(you) is the accusative of general reference. Note the mid- 
dle voice here as in aifeisthe in 3. Mayor argues that the 
middle here, in contrast with the active, carries more the 
spirit of prayer, but Moulton (Pro/., p. 160) regards the 
distinction between aifed and aiteomai often “an extinct 
subtlety.” 

3. Because ye ask amiss (dioti kakos aiteisthe). Here the 
indirect middle does make sense, “ye ask for yourselves” 
and that is “evilly” or amiss (kakés), as James explains. 
That ye may spend it in your pleasures (hina en tais hédonais 
humon dapanéséte). Purpose clause with hina and the first 
aorist subjunctive of dapanad, old verb from dapané, cost — 
(Luke 14:28 only in N.T.), to squander (Luke 15:14). God 
does not hear prayers like this. 

4. Ye adulteresses (motchalides). Moichoi kai (ye adul- 
terers) is spurious (Syrian text only). The feminine form 
here is a common late word from the masculine moichoi. It 
is not clear whether the word is to be taken literally here as 
in Rom. 7:3, or figuratively for all unfaithful followers of Christ 
(like an unfaithful bride), as in II Cor. 11:1f.; Eph. 5:24~28 
(the Bride of Christ). Either view makes sense in this 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 51 


context, probably the literal view being more in harmony 
with the language of verses 2f. In that case James may 
include more than Christians in his view, though Paul talks 
plainly to church members about unchastity (Eph. 5:3-5). 
Enmity with God (echthra tou theou). Objective genitive 
theou with echthra (predicate and so without article), old 
word from echthros, enemy (Rom. §:10), with eis theon (below 
and Rom. 8:7). Whosoever therefor? would be (hos ean oun 
boulethéi). Indefinite relative clause with fos and modal ean 
and the first aorist passive (deponent) subjunctive of 
boulomai, to will (purpose). 4 friend of the world (philos tou 
kosmou). Predicate nominative with infinitive eimai agreeing _ 
with hos. See 2:23 for philos theou (friend of God). Maketh 
himself (kathistatat). Present passive (not middle) indicative 
as in 3:6, “‘is constituted,” “‘is rendered.” 4n enemy of God 
(echthros tou theou). Predicate nominative and anarthrous 
and objective genitive (theou). 

5. The Scripture (hé graphé). Personification as in Gal. 3:8 
and James 2:23. But no O.T. passage is precisely like this, 
though it is “‘a poetical rendering” (Ropes) of Ex.20:5. The 
general thought occurs also in Gen. 6:3-5; Is. 63:8-16, etc. 
Paul has the same idea also (Gal. 5:17, 21; Rom. 8:6, 8). It 
is possible that the reference is really to the quotation in 
verse 6 from Prov. 3:34 and treating all before as a parenthe- 
sis. There is no way to decide positively. In vain (kends). 
Old adverb (Aristotle) from kenos (2:20), here alone in N.T. 
“Emptily,” not meaning what it says. Made to dwell 
(katoikisen). First aorist active of katoikizd, old verb, to give 
a dwelling to, only here in N.T. Long unto envying (pros 
phthonon epipothei). A difficult phrase. Some even take 
pros phthonon with legei rather than with epipothei, as it 
naturally does go, meaning “jealously.” But even sc, with 
God presented as a jealous lover, does to pneuma refer to the 
Holy Spirit as the subject of epipothei or to man’s spirit as 


52 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


the object of epipothei? Probably the former and epipothet 
then means to yearn after in the good sense as in Phil. 1:8. 

6. More grace (meizona charin). “Greater grace.” Greater 
than what? “Greater grace in view of the greater require- 
ment” (Ropes), like Rom. §:20f. God does this. Wherefore 
(dio). To prove this point James quotes Prov. 3:34. God 
resisteth the proud (ho theos huperéphanois antitassetai). Pres- 
ent middle (direct) indicative of antitassd, old military term, 
to range in battle against, with dative case (Rom. 13:2) as in 
5:6. Huperéphanois (huper, phainomai) is like our vernacu- 
lar “‘stuck-up folks” (Rom. 1:30), “haughty persons.” But 
giveth grace to the humble (tapeinois de didosin charin). 
Anarthrous adjective again, “to humble or lowly persons,” 
for which word see 1:9f. Cf. 2:5-73 5:1-6. 

7. Be subject therefore unto God (hupotagete oun toi thedt). 
Second aorist (ingressive) passive imperative of hupotassé, 
old verb, to range under (military term also). Same form in 
I Pet. 2:23; 5:5. With the dative case thedi (unto God). 
The aorist has the note of urgency in the imperative. Note 
the ten aorist imperatives in verses 7 to 10 (hupotagéte, anti- 
stete, eggisate, katharisate, hagnisate, talaiporésate, penthésate, 
klausate, metatrapéto, tapeinothéte). But resist the devil (anti- 
stéte de toi diaboloi). Second aorist (ingressive) active (in- 
transitive) imperative of anthisté@mi, “take a stand against.” 
Dative case diaboloi. Result of such a stand is that the devil 
will flee (pheuxetai, future middle of pheugod). See I Pet. 
§:8f.; Eph. 6:11f.; Luke 10:17. 

8. Draw nigh to God (eggisate toi thedi). First aorist active 
imperative of eggizd, late verb from eggus (near) as in Matt. 
3:2. With dative case again of personal relation. The 
priests in the sanctuary drew nigh to God (Ex. 19:22), as we 
should now. Cleanse your hands (katharisate cheiras). First 
aorist active imperative of katharizd, to cleanse, from dirt ina 
ritual sense (Ex. 30:19-21; Mark 7:3, 19). Here it is figura- 
tive, as in Hos. 1:16; Ps. 24:4. If we always had clean (from 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 53 


sin) hands and hearts? Ye sinners (hamartoloi). A sharp 
term to strike the conscience, “‘a reproach meant to startle 
and sting” (Ropes). Purify your hearts (hagnisate kardias). 
First aorist active imperative of hagnizd, old verb from 
hagnos (James 3:17), ceremonially (Acts 21:24, 26), but here 
morally as in I Pet. 1:22; I John 3:3. Anarthrous use of 
kardias as of cheiras (wash hands, purify hearts). Ye double- 
minded (dipsuchoi). As in 1:8. 

9. Be afflicted (talaiporésate). First aorist active impera- 
tive talaipored, old verb from talaiporos (Rom. 7:24), to 
endure toils, here only in N.T. Cf. salaiporiais in 5:1. 
Mourn (penthésate). First aorist active imperative of 
penthed, old verb from penthos (mourning, 4:9), as in Matt. 
5:4f. Often in N.T. joined as here with k/aid, to weep 
(Mark 16:10; Luke 6:25). Avcall to the godly sorrow spoken 
of in II Cor. 7:10 (Mayor), like an O.T. prophet. Weep 
(klausate). First aorist active imperative of k/aio. Laughter 
(gelés). Old word from Homer down, only here in N.T. as 
gelad, to laugh (opposite of k/aid), in N.T. only in Luke 
6:21, 25, but katagelad in Luke 8:53 (=Mark 5:40 =Matt. 
9:24). Be turned (metatrapéto). Second aorist passive im- 
perative of metatrepd, old word, to turn about, to transmute, 
in Homer (not in Attic), here only in N.T. Heaviness 
(katépheian). Old word from katéphés (of a downcast look, 
from kata, phaé eyes), hanging down of the eyes like the 
publican in Luke 18:13, here only in N.T. 

10. Humble yourselves (tapeinothéte). First aorist passive 
imperative of tapeinod, old verb from tapeinos (1:9), as in 
Matt. 18:4. The passive here has almost the middle or 
reflexive sense. The middle voice was already giving way 
to the passive. See I Pet. 5:6 for this same form with the 
same promise of exaltation. He shall exalt you (hupsoset 
humas). Future active indicative of hupsod, common verb 
from hupsos (height), used by Jesus in contrast with sapeinod 
as here (Matt. 23:12; Luke 14:11; 18:14). 


4 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


11. Speak not one against another (mé katalaleite allelon). 
Prohibition against such a habit or a command to quit doing 
it, with mé and the present imperative of katalaleo, old com- 
pound usually with the accusative in ancient Greek, in N.T. 
only with the genitive (here, I Pet. 2:12; 3:16). Often harsh 
words about the absent. James returns to the subject of the 
tongue as he does again in 5:12 (twice before, 1:26; 3:1-12). 
Fudgeth (krinon). In the sense of harsh judgment as in 
Matt. 7:1; Luke 6:37 (explained by katadikazo). Not a doer 
of the law, but a judge (ouk poiétés nomou, alla krités). ‘This 
tone of superiority to law is here sharply condemned. James 
has in mind God’s law, of course, but the point is the same 
for all laws under which we live. We cannot select the laws 
which we will obey unless some contravene God’s law, and so 
our own conscience (Acts 4:20). Then we are willing to give 
our lives for our rebellion if need be. 

12. One only (heis). No “only” in the Greek, but heis 
here excludes all others but God. The lawgiver (ho nomo- 
thetes). Old compound (from nomos, tithémi), only here in 
N.T. In Ps.9:20. Cf. nomotheted in Heb. 7:11; 8:6. To save 
(s0sai, first aorist active infinitive of 5020) and to destroy (kai 
apolesai, first aorist active infinitive of apollumi to destroy). 
Cf. the picture of God’s power in Matt. 10:28, a common 
idea in the O.T. (Deut. 32:39; I Sam. 2:16; II Kings 5:7). 
But who art thou? (su de tis ei;). Proleptic and emphatic 
position of sw (thou) in this rhetorical question as in Rom. 
9:20; 14:4. Thy neighbour (ton plésion). “The neighbour” 
as in James 2:8. 

13. Go to now (age nun). Interjectional use of age (from 
ago) as in §:1 (only N.T. instances) with a plural verb (Aoi 
legontes, present active articular participle, ye that say) as is 
common in ancient Greek like ide nun ékousate (Matt. 26:65). 
Today or tomorrow (sémeron é aurion). Correct text (Aleph 
B), not kai (and). Into this city (eis ténde ten polin). Old 
demonstrative 4ode, rare in N.T. (Luke 10:39) save in neuter 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 55 


plural tade (these things Acts 21:11). One would point out 
the city on the map (Mayor) as he made the proposal (we 
will go, poreusometha). And spend a year there (kai poié- 
somen ekei eniauton). Another future (active of poied). ““We 
will do a year there.” 4nd trade (kai emporeusometha). Future 
middle of emporeuomai (en, poreuomai, to go in), old verb 
from emporos (a merchant or trader, a drummer, one going in 
and getting the trade, Matt. 13:45), a vivid picture of the 
Jewish merchants of the time. 4nd get gain (kai kerdésomen). 
Future (Ionic form) active of kerdaind, old verb from kerdos 
(gain, Phil. 1:21), as in Matt. 16:26. 

14. Whereas ye know not (hoitines ouk epistasthe). The 
longer relative hostis defines here more precisely (like Latin 
qui) hoi legontes (ye who say) of verse 13 in a causal sense, 
as in Acts 10:47, ‘““who indeed do not know” (present mid- 
dle indicative of epistamai). What shall be on the morrow 
(t@s aurion). Supply hémeras (day) after aurion. This is 
the reading of B (Westcott) ‘‘on the morrow” (genitive of 
time), but Aleph K L cursives have to #és aurion (“the 
matter of tomorrow’’), while A P cursives have ¢a tés aurion 
(“the things of tomorrow”). The sense is practically the 
same, though /o #@s aurion is likely correct. What ts your 
life? (poia hé xé humon). ‘Thus Westcott and Hort punctu- 
ate it as an indirect question, not direct. Poia is a qualita- 
tive interrogative (of what character). 4 vapour (atmis). 
This is the answer. Old word for mist (like atmos, from which 
our “‘atmosphere”), in N.T. only here and Acts 2:19 with 
kapnou (vapour of smoke (from Joel 2:30). For a little 
time (pros oligon). See same phrase in I Tim. 4:8, pros 
kairon in Luke 8:13, pros horan in John 5:35. That appear- 
eth and then vanisheth away (phainomené epeita kai aphani- 
zomené). Present middle participles agreeing with atmis, 
“appearing, then also disappearing,” with play on the two 
verbs (phainomai, aphaniz0 as in Matt. 6:19, from aphanés 


56 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


hidden Heb. 4:13) with the same root phan (phaino, 
a-phan-és). 

15. For that ye ought to say (anti tou legein humas). “In- 
stead of the saying as to you” (genitive of the articular 
infinitive with the preposition anti and the accusative of 
general reference with /egein), ‘‘instead of your saying.” Jf 
the Lord will (ean ho kurios theléi). Condition of the third 
class with ean and the present active subjunctive (or first 
aorist active theleséi in some MSS). The proper attitude 
of mind (Acts 18:21; I Cor. 4:19; 16:7; Rom. 1:19; Phil. 
2:19, 24; Heb. 6:3), not to be uttered always in words like 
acharm. This Hellenistic formula was common among the 
ancient heathen, as today among modern Arabs like the 
Latin deo volente. This or that (touto é ekeino). Applicable 
to every act. 

16. In your vauntings (en tais alazoniais humon). Old 
word for braggart talk (from alazoneuomai, to act the alazon 
empty boaster Rom. 1:30), common in Aristophanes, in 
N.T. only here and I John 2:16. Glorying (kauchésis). Act 
of glorying, late word from kauchaomai, good if for Christ 
(I Thess. 2:19), bad if for self as here. 

17. To him that knoweth (eidoti). Dative case of second 
perfect participle eidds (from oida), and with the infinitive 
to know how, “‘to one knowing how.” To do good (kalon 
potein). “To do a good deed.” And doeth it not (kai mé 
potounti). Dative again of the present active participle of 
poied, “and to one not doing it.” Cf. “not a doer” (1:23) 
and Matt. 7:26. Sin (hamartia). Unused knowledge of 
one’s duty is sin, the sin of omission. Cf. Matt. 23:23. 


CHAPTER V 


1. Come now, ye rich (age nun hoi plousioi). Exclamatory 
interjection as in 4:13. Direct address to the rich as a class 
as in I Tim. 6:17. Apparently here James has in mind the 
rich as a class, whether believer, as in 1:10f., or unbeliever, 
as in 2:1f., 6. The plea here is not directly for reform, but 
a warning of certain judgment (5:1-6) and for Christians 
“a certain grim comfort in the hardships of poverty” 
(Ropes) in 5:7-11. Weep and howl (klausate ololuzontes). 
“Burst into weeping (ingressive aorist active imperative of 
klaid as in 4:9), howling with grief” (present active par- 
ticiple of the old onomatopoetic verb o/o/uzé, here only in 
N.T., like Latin ululare, with which compare alalazo in 
Matt. 5:38. For your miseries (epi tais talaiporiais humon). 
Old word from falaiporos (Rom. 7:24) and like talaipored 
in James 4:9 (from ¢/a0 to endure and poros a callus). That 
are coming upon you (tais eperchomenais). Present middle 
participle of the old compound eperchomai to come upon, 
used here in futuristic prophetic sense. 

2. Riches (ho ploutos). Masculine singular, but occasion- 
ally neuter ¢o ploutos in nominative and accusative (II Cor. 
8:2). Apparently p/eotos fulness (from pleos full, pimplemi 
to fill). “Wealth.” re corrupted (sesépen). Second per- 
fect active indicative of sép0 (root sap as in sapros, rotten), 
to corrupt, to destroy, here intransitive “‘has rotted.” Only 
here in N.T. On the worthlessness of mere wealth see 
Matt. 6:19, 24. Are moth-eaten (setobrita gegonen). “Have 
become (second perfect indicative of ginomai, singular num- 
ber, though himatia, neuter plural, treated collectively) 
moth-eaten” (sétobrata, late and rare compound from sés, 
moth, Matt. 6:19f. and dratos, verbal adjective of didrosko 

57 


58 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


to eat John 6:13. This compound found only here, Job 
13:28, Sibyll. Orac. Proem. 64). Rich robes as heirlooms, 
but moth-eaten. Vivid picture. Witness the 250 “‘lost 
millionaires” in the United States in 1931 as compared 
with 1929. Riches have wings. 

3. Are rusted (katidtai). Perfect passive indicative (sin- 
gular for chrusos and arguros are grouped as one) of katiod, 
late verb (from ios, rust) with perfective sense of kata, to 
rust through (down to the bottom), found only here, Sir. 
12:11, Epictetus (Diss. 4, 6, 14). Rust (ios). Poison in 
James 3:8; Rom. 3:13 (only N.T. examples of old word). 
Silver does corrode and gold will tarnish. Dioscorides (V.g1) 
tells about gold being rusted by chemicals. Modern chem- 
ists can even transmute metals as the alchemists claimed. 
For a testimony (eis marturion). Common idiom as in Matt. 
8:4 (use of eis with accusative in predicate). Against you 
(humin). Dative of disadvantage as in Mark 6:11 (eis 
marturion autois) where in the parallel passage (Luke 9:5) 
we have. eis marturion ep autous. “To you” will make 
sense, as in Matt. 8:4; 10:18, but “against” is the idea here 
as in Luke 21:13. Shall eat (phagetai). Future middle (late 
form from ephagon) of defective verb esthid, to eat. Your 
Jlesh (tas sarkas). The plural is used for the fleshy parts 
of the body like pieces of flesh (Rev. 17:16; 19:18, 21). 
Rust eats like a canker, like cancer in the body. 4s fire 
(40s pur). Editors differ here whether to connect this phrase 
with phagetai, just before (as Mayor), for fire eats up more 
rapidly than rust, or with the following, as Westcott and 
Hort and Ropes, that is the eternal fire of Gehenna which 
awaits them (Matt. 25:41; Mark 9:44). This interpretation 
makes a more vivid picture for ethésaurisate (ye have laid 
up, first aorist active indicative of thésaurizd, Matt. 6:19 
and see Prov. 16:27), but it is more natural to take it with 
phagetai. 

4- The hire (ho misthos). Old word for wages (Matt. 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 59 


20:8). Labourers (ergatén). Any one who works (ergazo- 
mai), especially agricultural workers (Matt. 9:37). Who 
mowed (ton amésanton). Genitive plural of the articular 
first aorist active participle of amad (from hama, together), 
old verb, to gather together, to reap, here only in N.T. 
Fields (choras). Estates or farms (Luke 12:16). Which is 
of you kept back by fraud (ho aphusterémenos aph’ humon). 
Perfect passive articular participle of aphustered, late com- 
pound (simplex Austereo common as Matt. 19:20), to be 
behindhand from, to fail of, to cause to withdraw, to de- 
fraud. Pitiful picture of earned wages kept back by rich 
Jews, old problem of capital and labour that is with us 
yet in acute form. The cries (hai boai). Old word from 
which 4oad comes (Matt. 3:3), here only in N.T. The stolen 
money “cries out”’ (krazei), the workers cry out for venge- 
ance. That reaped (ton therisanton). Genitive plural of the 
articular participle first aorist active of therizd (old verb 
from theros, sammer, Matt. 24:32), to reap, to harvest while 
summer allows (Matt. 6:26). Have entered (eiseléluthan). 
Perfect active third person plural indicative of eiserchomai, 
old and common compound, to go or come into. This late 
form is by analogy of the aorist for the usual form in -asi. 
Of the Lord of Sabaoth (Kuriou Sabaoth). “Of the Lord of 
Hosts,” quotation from Is. 5:9 as in Rom. 9:29, transliterat- 
ing the Hebrew word for “Hosts,” an expression for the 
omnipotence of God like Pantokrator (Rev. 4:8). God hears 
the cries of the oppressed workmen even if the employers 
are deaf. 

5. Ye have lived delicately (etruphésate). First aorist (con- 
stative, summary) active indicative of truphad, old verb 
from ¢ruphé (luxurious living as in Luke 7:25, from thrupto, 
to break down, to enervate), to lead a soft life, only here 
in N.T. Taken your pleasure (espatalésate). First aorist 
(constative) active indicative of spatalad, late and rare verb 
to live voluptuously or wantonly (from spatalé, riotous liv-

ing, wantonness, once as bracelet), in N.T. only here and 
I Tim. 5:6. Ye have nourished (ethrepsate). First aorist 
(constative) active indicative of trephd, old verb, to feed, 
to fatten (Matt. 6:26). They are fattening themselves like 
sheep or oxen all unconscious of “‘the day of slaughter” 
(en hémerai sphagés, definite without the article) ahead of 
them. For this use of sphagés see Rom. 8:36 (probata 
sphages, sheep for the slaughter, sphagé from sphazd, to 
slay), consummate sarcasm on the folly of sinful rich people. 

6. Ye have condemned (katedikasate). First aorist active 
indicative of katadikazé, old verb (from katadiké, condemna- 
tion, Acts 25:15). The rich controlled the courts of justice. 
Ye have killed the righteous one (ephoneusate ton dikaion). 
First aorist active indicative of phoneud (2:11; 4:2). “The 
righteous one”’ (ton dikaion) is the generic use of the singular 
with article for the class. There is probably no direct refer- 
ence to one individual, though it does picture well the death 
of Christ and also the coming death of James himself, who 
was called the Just (Eus. H.£. 11.23). Stephen (Acts 7:52) 
directly accuses the Sanhedrin with being betrayers and 
murderers (prodotai kai phoneis) of the righteous one (tou 
dikaiou). He doth not resist you (ouk antitassetai humin). 
It is possible to treat this as a question. Present middle 
indicative of antitassd, for which see James 4:6. Without 
a question the unresisting end of the victim (ton dikaion) 
is pictured. With a question (ovk, expecting an affirmative 
answer) God or Lord is the subject, with the final judgment 
in view. There is no way to decide definitely. 

7. Be patient therefore (makrothumésate oun). A direct 
corollary (oun, therefore) from the coming judgment on the 
wicked rich (5:1-6). First aorist (constative) active im- 
perative of makrothumed, late compound (Plutarch, LXX) 
from makrothumos (makros, thumos, of long spirit, not losing 
heart), as in Matt. 18:26. The appeal is to the oppressed 
brethren. Catch your wind for a long race (long-tempered 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 61 


as opposed to short-tempered). See already the exhorta- 
tion to patience (hupomoné) in 1:3f., 12 and repeated in 
5:11. They will need both submission (hupomené 5:11) 
and steadfastness (makrothumia 5:10). Until the coming of the 
Lord (heds tés parousias). The second coming of Christ he 
means, the regular phrase here and in verse 8 for that idea 
(Matt. 24:3, 37, 39; I Thess. 2:19, etc.). The hushandman 
(ho georgos). The worker in the ground (gé, ergo) as in 
Matt. 21:33f. Waiteth for (ekdechetai). Present middle in- 
dicative of ekdechomai, old verb for eager expectation as in 
Acts 17:16. Precious (timion). Old adjective from timé 
(honor, price), dear to the farmer because of his toil for it.. 
See I Pet. 1:19. Being patient over it (makrothumon ep’ 
autoi). Present active participle of makrothumed just used 
in the exhortation, picturing the farmer longing and hoping 
over his precious crop (cf. Luke 18:7 of God). Until it re- 
ceive (heos labei). Temporal clause of the future with eds 
and the second aorist active subjunctive of /amband, vividly 
describing the farmer’s hopes and patience. The early and 
latter rain (proimon kai opsimon). ‘The word for rain (Aueton 
Acts 14:17) is absent from the best MSS. The adjective 
proimos (from proi, early) occurs here only in N.T., though 
old in the form proimos and prois. See Deut. 11:14; Jer. 
5:24, etc. for these terms for the early rain in October or 
November for the germination of the grain, and the latter 
rain (opsimon, from opse, late, here only in N.T.) in April 
and May for maturing the grain. 

8. Ye also (kai humeis). Aswellasthe farmers. Stablish 
(stérixate). First aorist active imperative of stérizd, old verb, 
(from sférigx, a support) to make stable, as in Luke 22:32; 
I Thess. 3:13. Is at hand (éggiken). Present perfect active 
indicative of eggizd, common verb, to draw near (from eggus), 
in James 4:8, for drawing near. Same form used by John in 
his preaching (Matt. 3:2). In I Pet. 4:7 the same word 
appears to have an eschatological sense as apparently here. 


62 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


How “near” or “nigh” did James mean? Clearly, it could 
only be a hope, for Jesus had distinctly said that no one knew 
when he would return. 

g. Murmur not (mé stenazete). Prohibition with mé and 
the present active imperative of stenazd, old verb, to groan. 
“Stop groaning against one another,” as some were already 
doing in view of their troubles. In view of the hope of the 
Second Coming lift up your heads. That ye be not judged 
(hina mé krithéte). Negative purpose clause with hina mé 
and the first aorist passive subjunctive of krind. As already 
indicated (2:12f.; 4:12) and repeated in 5:12. Reminiscence 
of the words of Jesusin Matt. 7:1f. Standeth before the doors 
(pro tin thuron hestéken). Perfect active indicative of 
histemi, “is standing now.” Again like the language of 
Jesus in Matt. 24:33 (epi thurais) and Mark 13:29. Jesus 
the Judge is pictured as ready to enter for the judgment. 

10. For an example (hupodeigma). Late word for the old 
paradeigma, from hupodeiknumi, to copy under, to teach 
(Luke 6:47), here for copy to be imitated as in John 13:15, 
as a warning (Heb. 4:11). Here predicate accusative with 
tous prophétas (the prophets) as the direct object of labete 
(second aorist active imperative of /ambano). Of suffering 
(tés kakopathias). Old word from kakopathés (suffering evil, 
kakopatheo in verse 13 and II Tim. 2:3, 9), here only in N.T. 
Of patience (makrothumias). Like makrothumeod in 5:7. See 
both makrothumia and hupomoné in II Cor. 4:6; Col. 1:11 
(the one restraint from retaliating, the other not easily suc- 
cumbing). In the name of (en toi onomati). As in Jer. 20:9. 
With the authority of the Lord (Deissmann, Bible Studies, 
p- 198). Oxy 

11. We call blessed (makarizomen). Old word (present 
active indicative of makarizd), from makarios (happy), in 
N.T. only here and Luke 1:48. “We felicitate.” As in 
1:3, 12 and Dan. 12:12. Ye have heard (ékousate). First 
aorist (constative) active indicative of akoud. As in Matt. 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 63 


5:21, 27, 33, 38, 43. Ropes suggests in the synagogues. Of 
Fob (I0b). Job did complain, but he refused to renounce 
God (Job 1:21; 2:10; 13:15; 16:19; 19:25f.). He had become 
a stock illustration of loyal endurance. Ye have seen (eidete). 
Second aorist (constative) active indicative of horad. In 
Job’s case. The end of the Lord (to telos kuriou). The con- 
clusion wrought by the Lord in Job’s case (Job 42:12). Full 
of pity (polusplagchnos). Late and rare compound (polus, 
splagchnon), only here in N.T. It occurs also in Hermas 
(Sim. v. 7. 4; Mand. iv, 3). “Very kind.” Merciful 
(oiktirmon). Late and rare adjective (from oikteiro to pity), 
in N.T. only here and Luke 6:36. 

12. Above all things (pro panton). No connection with 
what immediately precedes. Probably an allusion to the 
words of Jesus (Matt. 5:34-37). It is not out of place here. 
See the same phrase in I Pet. 4:8. Robinson (Ephesians, 
p- 279) cites like examples from the papyri at the close of 
letters. Here it means “But especially” (Ropes). Swear 
not (mé omnuete). Prohibition of the habit (or to quit doing 
it if guilty) with mé and the present active imperative of 
omnud. The various oaths (profanity) forbidden (méte, 
thrice) are in the accusative case after omnuete, according to 
rule (ouranon, gén, horkon). The Jews were wont to split 
hairs in their use of profanity, and by avoiding God’s name 
imagine that they were not really guilty of this sin, just as 
professing Christians today use “pious oaths” which violate 
the prohibition of Jesus. Let be (0). Imperative active 
third singular of eimi, late form (I Cor. 16:22) for esto. 
“Your yea be yea” (and no more). A different form from 
that in Matt. 5:37. That ye fall not under judgment (hina mé 
hupo krisin peséte). Negative purpose with hina mé and the 
second aorist active subjunctive of pipfa, to fall. See hina 
mé krithéte in verse 9. Krisis (from krind) is the act of judg- 
ing rather than the judgment rendered (krima James 3:1). 

13. Is any suffering? (kakopathet tis;). See verse to for 


64 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


kakopathia. The verb in N.T. occurs only here and in 
II Tim. 2:3, 9; 4:5. The lively interrogative is common in 
the diatribe and suits the style of James. Among you 
(en humin). As in 3:13. Let him pray (proseuchestho). 
Present middle imperative, “let him keep on praying” 
(instead of cursing as in verse 12). Is any cheerful (euthumei;). 
Present active indicative of euthumed, old verb from euthumos 
(Acts 27:36), in N.T. only here and Acts 27:22, 25. Let him 
sing praise (psalleto). Present active imperative of psallo, 
originally to twang a chord as on a harp, to sing praise to God 
whether with instrument or without, in N.T. only here, I Cor. 
14:15; Rom. 15:9; Eph. 5:19. “‘Let him keep on making 
melody.” 

14. Is any among you sick? (asthenei tis en humin;). 
Present active indicative of asthened, old verb, to be weak 
(without strength), often in N.T. (Matt. 10:8). Let him call 
for (proskalesastho). First aorist (ingressive) middle impera- 
tive of proskaled. Note change of tense (aorist) and middle 
(indirect) voice. Care for the sick is urged in I Thess. 5:14 
(“help the sick”). Note the plural here, “elders of the 
church,” as in Acts 20:17; 15:6, 22; 21:18; Phil. 1:1 (bishops). 
Let them pray over him (proseuxasthisan ep auton). First 
aorist middle imperative of proseuchomai. Prayer for the 
sick is clearly enjoined. Anointing him with oil (aleipsantes 
elaioi). First aorist active participle of a/eiphd, old verb, to 
anoint, and the instrumental case of elaion (oil). The aorist 
participle can be either simultaneous or antecedent with 
proseuxasthosan (pray). See the same use of aleipho elaioi 
in Mark 6:13. The use of olive oil was one of the best 
remedial agencies known to the ancients. They used it 
internally and externally. Some physicians prescribe it 
today. Itis clear both in Mark 6:13 and here that medicinal 
value is attached to the use of the oil and emphasis is placed 
on the worth of prayer. There is nothing here of the pagan 
magic or of the later practice of “extreme unction”’ (after the 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 65 


eighth century). It is by no means certain that aleiphd here 
and in Mark 6:13 means “anoint” in a ceremonial fashion 
rather than “rub” as.it commonly does in medical treatises. 
Trench (N.T. Synonyms) says: “‘4/eiphein is the mundane 
and profane, chriein the sacred and religious, word.” At 
bottom in James we have God and medicine, God and the 
doctor, and that is precisely where we are today. The best 
physicians believe in God and want the help of prayer. 

15. The prayer of faith (hé euché tés pisteds). Cf. 1:6 for 
prayer marked by faith. Shall save (sdsei). Future active 
of s0z0, to make well. As in Matt. 9:21f.; Mark 6:56. No 
reference here to salvation of the soul. The medicine does 
not heal the sick, but it helps nature (God) do it. The 
doctor codperates with God in nature. The sick (ton kam- 
nonta). Present active articular participle of kamnd, old 
verb, to grow weary (Heb. 12:3), to be sick (here), only 
N.T. examples. The Lord shall raise him up (egerei auton 
ho kurios). Future active of egeird. Precious promise, but 
not for a professional “‘faith-healer” who scoffs at medicine 
and makes merchandise out of prayer. And if he have com- 
mitted sins (kan hamartias @i pepoiékos). Periphrastic per- 
fect active subjunctive (unusual idiom) with kai ean (crasis 
kdn) in condition of third class. Supposing that he has 
committed sins as many sick people have (Mark 2:5ff.; 
John 5:14; 9:2f.; I Cor. 11:30). It shall be forgiven him 
(aphethésetai autdi). Future passive of aphiémi (impersonal 
passive as in Matt. 7:2, 7; Rom. 10:10). Not in any magical 
way, not because his sickness has been healed, not without 
change of heart and turning to God through Christ. Much 
is assumed here that is not expressed. 

16. Confess therefore your sins one to another (exomolo- 
geisthe oun allélois tas hamartias). Present middle (indirect) 
of exomologed. Confession of sin to God is already assumed. 
But public confession of certain sins to one another in the 
meetings is greatly helpful in many ways. This is not con- 


66 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


fessing to one man like a priest in place of the public con- 
fession. One may confess to the pastor without confessing 
to God or to the church, with little benefit to anybody. 
Pray for one another (proseuchesthe huper allélin). Present 
middle imperative. Keep this up. That ye may be healed 
(hopos iathéte). Purpose clause with hopds and the first 
aorist passive subjunctive of iaomai. Probably of bodily 
healing (verse 14), though iaomai is used also of healing of 
the soul (Matt. 13:15; I Pet. 2:24; Heb. 12:13) as Mayor 
takes it here. vaileth much (polu ischuei). ‘‘Has much 
force.” Present active indicative of ischud (from ischus, 
strength). Jn its working (energoumené). Probably the 
present middle participle of energed as Paul apparently uses 
it in Gal. 5:6; I] Cor. 4:12; II Thess. 2:7, meaning “when 
it works.” The passive is possible, as is the usual idiom 
elsewhere. Mayor argues strongly for the passive here, 
“when it is exercised” (Ropes). 

17. Of like passions with us (homoiopathés hémin). As- 
sociative-instrumental case hémin as with homoios. This old 
compound adjective (homoios, pascho), suffering the like with 
another, in N.T. only here and Acts 14:15. He prayed 
fervently (proseuchéi proséuxato). First aorist middle in- 
dicative of proseuchomai and the instrumental case proseu- 
chéi (cognate substantive), after idiom for intensity in clas- 
sical Greek, like pheugein phugéi, to flee with all speed 
(figura etymologica), but particularly frequent in the LXX 
(Gen. 2:17; 31:30) in imitation of the Hebrew infinitive 
absolute. So Luke 22:15; John 3:29; Acts 4:17. That it 
might not rain (tou mé brexai). Genitive of the articular 
infinitive (4rexai, first aorist active of brechd, old verb, to 
moisten, Luke 7:38, to rain, Matt. 5:45) with negative me 
used either for direct purpose, for an object clause as here 
and Acts 3:12; 15:20, or even for result. For three years and 
six months (eniautous treis kai ménas hex). Accusative of 
extent of time. | 


THE EPISTLE OF JAMES 67 


18. Gave rain (hueton eddken). This idiom is in the LXX 
of God as here of heaven (I Sam. 12:17; I Kings 18:1) and 
also in Acts 14:17 instead of ebrexen of verse 17. Hueton 
is old word for rain (from Aud, to rain), genuine here, but 
not in verse 7. Brought forth (eblastésen). First aorist ac- 
tive of dlastand, old verb, to sprout (intransitive as Mark 
4:27), here as occasionally in later Greek transitive with 
accusative karpon. 

19. If any one among you do err (ean tis en humin plané- 
thei). Third-class condition (supposed case) with ean and 
the first aorist passive subjunctive of planaéd, old verb, to 
go astray, to wander (Matt. 18:12), figuratively (Heb. 5:2). 
From the truth (apo tés alétheias). For truth see 1:18; 3:14; 
John 8:32; I John 1:6; 3:18f. It was easy then, and is now, 
to be led astray from Christ, who is the Truth. 4nd one 
convert him (kai epistrepséi tis auton). Continuation of the 
third-class condition with the first aorist active subjunctive 
of epistrephd, old verb, to turn (transitive here as in Luke 
1:16f., but intransitive often as Acts 9:35). 

20. Let him know (ginosketo). Present active imperative 
third person singular of gindskd, but Westcott and Hort read 
ginoskete (know ye) after B. In either case it is the con- 
clusion of the condition in verse 19. He which converteth 
(ho epistrepsas). First aorist active articular participle of 
epistrepho of verse 19. From the error (ek planés). “Out of 
the wandering” of verse 19 (plané, from which planaé is 
made). See I John 4:6 for contrast between “truth” and 
“error.” 4 soul from death (psuchéen ek thanatou). The soul 
of the sinner (Aamartolon) won back to Christ, not the soul 
of the man winning him. A few MSS. have autou added 
(his soul), which leaves it ambiguous, but aufou is not gen- 
uine. It is ultimate and final salvation here meant by the 
future (sdsei). Shall cover a multitude of sins (kalupset 
plethos hamartion). Future active of kaluptd, old verb, to 
hide, to veil. But whose sins (those of the converter or the 


68 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


converted)? The Roman Catholics (also Mayor and Ropes) 
take it of the sins of the converter, who thus saves himself 
by saving others. The language here will allow that, but 
not New Testament teaching in general. It is apparently 
a proverbial saying which Resch considers one of the un- 
written sayings of Christ (Clem. Al. Paed. iii. 12). It oc- 
curs also in I Pet. 4:8, where it clearly means the sins of 
others covered by love as a veil thrown over them. The 
saying appears also in Prov. 10:12: “Hatred stirs up strife, 
but love hides all transgressions” —that is “love refuses to 
see faults” (Mayor admits). That is undoubtedly the mean- 
ing in I Pet. 4:8 and James §:20.

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


THE AUTHOR 


The Epistle is not anonymous, but claims to be written 
by ‘‘Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ” (1:1), that is Cephas 
(Simon Peter). If this is not true, then the book is pseu- 
donymous by a late writer who assumed Peter’s name, as 
in the so-called Gospel of Peter, Apocalypse of Peter, etc. 
“There is no book in the New Testament which has earlier, - 
better, or stronger attestation, though Irenzus is the first 
to quote it by name” (Bigg). Eusebius (H.EZ. i. Gee) 
places it among the acknowledged books, those accepted 
with no doubt at all. We here assume that Simon Peter 
wrote this Epistle or at any rate dictated it by an amanu- 
ensis, as Paul did in Romans (16:22). Bigg suggests Sil- 
vanus (Silas) as the amanuensis or interpreter (I Pet. 5:12), 
the obvious meaning of the language (dia, through). He 
may also have been the bearer of the Epistle. It happens 
that we know more of Peter’s life than of any of the twelve 
apostles because of his prominence in the Gospels and in 
the first fifteen chapters of the Acts. In the Student's 
Chronological New Testament 1 have given a full list of the 
passages in the Gospels where Peter appears with any clear- 
ness and the material is rich and abundant. The account 
in Acts is briefer, though Peter is the oustanding man in 
the first five chapters during his career in Jerusalem. After 
the conversion of Saul he begins to work outside of Jeru- 
salem and after escaping death at the hands of Herod 
Agrippa I (Acts 12:3ff.) he left for a while, but is back in 
Jerusalem at the Conference called by Paul and Barnabas 
(Acts 15:6-14; Gal. 2:1-10). After that we have no more 

71 


72 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


about him in Acts, though he reappears in Antioch and is 
rebuked by Paul for cowardice because of the Judaizers 
(Gal. 11-21). He travelled for the Gospel among the Jews 
of the Dispersion (Gal. 2:9) with his wife (I Cor. 9:5), and 
went to Asia Minor (I Pet. 1:1) and as far as Babylon or 
Rome (I Pet. 5:13). Besides Silvanus he had John Mark 
with him also (I Pet. 5:13), who was said by the early 
Christian writers to have been Peter’s “interpreter” in his 
preaching, since Peter was not expert in the Greek (Acts 
4:13), and who also wrote his Gospel under the inspiration 
of Peter’s preaching. We are not able to follow clearly the 
close of his life or to tell precisely the time of his death. 
He was apparently put to death in a.p. 67 or 68, but some 
think that he was executed in Rome in a.p. 64. 


Tue Date 


This question is tied up with that of the genuineness of 
the Epistle, the time of Peter’s death, the use of Paul’s 
Epistles, the persecution referred to in the Epistle. As- 
suming the genuineness of the Epistle and the death of 
Peter about a.p. 67 or 68 and the persecution to be not that 
under Domitian or Trajan, but under Nero, the date can 
be assumed to be about a.p. 65. 


Tue Use or Paut’s Episties 


There are two extremes about the relation of Peter to 
Paul. One is that of violent antithesis, with Peter and Paul 
opposing one another by exaggerating and prolonging Paul’s 
denunciation of Peter’s cowardice in Antioch (Gal. 2:11-21) 
and making Peter also the exponent of a Jewish type of 
Christianity (practically a Judaizing type). This view of 
Baur once had quite a following, but it has nearly disap- 
peared. Under its influence Acts and Peter’s Epistles were 
considered not genuine, but documents designed to patch 
up the disagreement between Peter and Paul. The other 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 73 


extreme is to deny any Pauline influence on Peter or of 
Peter on Paul. Paul was friendly to Peter (Gal. 1:18), but 
was independent of his ecclesiastical authority (Gal. 2:1-10) 
and Peter championed Paul’s cause in the Jerusalem Con- 
ference (Acts 15:7-13). Peter was certainly not a Judaizer 
(Acts 11:1-18), in spite of his temporary defection in Anti- 
och. Undoubtedly Peter was won back to cordial relations 
with Paul if any confidence can be placed in II Pet. 3:15f. 
There is no reason for doubting that Peter was familiar 
with some of Paul’s Epistles as there indicated. There is 
some indication of Peter’s use of Romans and Ephesians in 
this Epistle. It is not always conclusive to find the same - 
words and even ideas which are not formally quoted, be- 
cause there was a Christian vocabulary and a body of 
doctrinal ideas in common though with personal variations 
in expression. Peter may have read James, but not the 
Pastoral Epistles. There are points of contact with Hebrews 
which Von Soden considers sufficiently accounted for by 
the fact that Peter and the author of Hebrews were con- 
temporaries. 


Tue PERSECUTION PICTURED IN THE EPISTLE 


Peter himself knew what persecution was at the hands 
of the Sanhedrin and of Herod Agrippa I (both church and 
state). If First Peter was written A.D. 65, there was time 
enough for the persecution of Nero in Rome in A.D. 64 to 
spread to Asia Minor. The province easily imitated the 
capital city. Paul’s life in the Acts and his Epistles abun- 
dantly show how early persecution arose in Asia Minor. 
The Apocalypse, written during the reign of Domitian, 
shows that persecution from the state had been on hand 
long before and was an old burden. We know too little of 
the history of Christianity in Asia Minor from a.p. 60 to 
70 to deny that the fiery trials and suffering as a Christian 


74 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(I Pet. 4:16) can be true of this period. So we locate the 
persecution at this time as an echo from Rome. 


Tue Puiace or WrirtInc 


Peter states that he is in Babylon (I Pet. 5:13), appar- 
ently with his wife (I Cor. 9:5). It is not certain whether 
he means actual Babylon, where Jews had been numerous, 
or mystical Babylon (Rome) as in the Apocalypse. We 
do not know when Rome began to be called Babylon. It 
may have started as a result of Nero’s persecution of the 
Christians after the burning of Rome. The Christians were 
called “‘evil-doers” (I Pet. 2:12) in the time of Nero (Taci- 
tus, dun. XV. 44). So we can think of Rome as the place 
of writing and that Peter uses “Babylon” to hide his actual 
location from Nero. Whether Peter came to Rome while 
Paul was still there we do not know, though John Mark 
was there with Paul (Col. 4:10). “At the time when it 
was written Babylon had not yet unmasked all its terrors, 
and the ordinary Christian was not in immediate danger of 
the tunica ardens, or the red-hot iron chair, or the wild 
beasts, or the stake” (Bigg). 


Tue READERS 


Peter writes “to the elect who are sojourners of the Dis- 
persion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia” 
(1:1). These five Roman provinces are naturally given from | 
the standpoint of Babylon. In Galatia and Asia Paul had 
labored, though not all over these provinces. At any rate, 
there is no reason to wonder that Peter should himself 
work in the same regions where Paul had been. In a gen- 
eral way Paul and Peter had agreed on separate spheres of 
activity, Paul to the Gentiles and Peter to the Jews (Gal. 
21:7ff.), though the distinction was not absolute, for Paul 
usually began his work in the Jewish synagogue. Probably 
the readers are mainly Jewish Christians. but not to the 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 75 


exclusion of Gentiles. Peter has clearly Paul’s idea that 
Christianity is the true Judaism of God’s promise (I Pet. 
24-10). 


THE Purpose 


Evidently Peter’s object is to cheer and strengthen the 
Christians in these five provinces who are undergoing fiery 
trials (1:7f.). There is every reason why Peter, as the lead- 
ing apostle to the circumcision, should write to these be- 
lievers in the provinces, especially since Paul’s long imprison- 
ment in Caesarea and Rome had removed him from his 
accustomed activities and travel. 


THE STYLE AND VOCABULARY 


Like Peter’s discourses in the Acts, the Epistle is mainly 
hortatory, with a minimum of argument and little of the 
closely knit reasoning seen in Romans. There is frequent 
use of the LXX and the Greek is decent Koiné with little 
of the uncouth Aramaic of the Galilean (Matt. 26:73), or 
of the vernacular Koiné as seen in the papyri or in II Peter 
(Acts 4:13). This fact may be accounted for by the help 
of Silvanus as amanuensis. There are sixty-two words in 
the Greek of the Epistle not occurring elsewhere in the 
N.T. There is verbal iteration as in II Peter. ‘“‘One idea 
haunts the whole Epistle; to the author, as to the patriarch 
Jacob, life is a pilgrimage; it is essentially an old man’s 
view” (Bigg). But it is an old man who has lived long with 
Christ. Peter has learned the lesson of humility and pa- 
tience from Jesus his Lord.

CHAPTER I 


1. Peter (Petros). Greek form for the Aramaic (Chaldaic) 
Cephas, the nickname given Simon by Jesus when he first 
saw him (John 1:42) and reaffirmed in the Greek form on 
his great confession (Matt. 16:18), with an allusion to petra, 
another form for a rock, ledge, or cliff. In II Peter 1:1 we 
have both Simon and Petros. Paul in his Epistles always 
terms himself Paul, not Saul. So Peter uses this name, not 
Cephas or Simon, because he is writing to Christians scat- 
tered over Asia Minor. The nominative absolute occurs 
here as in James 1:1, but without chairein as there, the 
usual form of greeting in letters (Acts 23:26) so common in 
the papyri. An apostle of Fesus Christ (apostolos Tésou 
Christou). This is his official title, but in II Pet. 1:1 doulos 
is added, which occurs alone in James 1:1. In II and III 
John we have only ho presbuteros (the elder), as Peter terms 
himself sunpresbuteros in I Pet. 5:1. Paul’s usage varies 
greatly: only the names in I and II Thessalonians, the title 
apostolos added and defended in Galatians and Romans as 
also in I and II Corinthians and Colossians and Ephesians 
and II Timothy with ‘“‘by the will of God” added, and in 
I Timothy with the addition of “according to the command 
of God.” In Philippians Paul has only ‘‘doulos (slave) 
Christou Iésou,” like James and Jude. In Romans and 
Titus Paul has both doulos and apostolos, like II Peter, 
while in Philemon he uses only desmios (prisoner) Jésou 
Christou. To the elect (eklektois). Without article (with the 
article in Matt. 24:22, 24, 31) and dative case, “‘to elect 
persons” (viewed as a group). Bigg takes ek/ektois (old, but 
rare verbal adjective from ek/egd, to pick out, to select) as 
an adjective describing the next word, ‘“‘to elect sojourn- 

78 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 49 


ers.” That is possible and is like genos eklekton in 2:9. See 
the distinction between k/étoi (called) and ek/ektoi (chosen) 
in Matt. 22:14. Who are sojourners (parepidémois). Late 
double compound adjective (para, epidé@mountes, Acts 2:10, 
to sojourn by the side of natives), strangers sojourning for 
a while in a particular place. So in Polybius, papyri, in 
LXX only twice (Gen. 23:4; 38 or 39 12), in N.T. only 
here, 2:11; Heb. 11:13. The picture in the metaphor here 
is that heaven is our native country and we are only tem- 
porary sojourners here on earth. Of the Dispersion (dias- 
poras). See John 7:35 for literal sense of the word for scat- 
tered (from diaspeird, to scatter abroad, Acts 8:1) Jews 
outside of Palestine, and James 1:1 for the sense here to 
Jewish Christians, including Gentile Christians (only N.T. 
examples). Note absence of the argicle, though a definite 
conception (of the Dispersion). The Christian is a pilgrim 
on his way to the homeland. These five Roman provinces 
include what we call Asia Minor north and west of the 
Taurus mountain range (Hort). Hort suggests that the 
order here suggests that Silvanus (bearer of the Epistle) 
was to land in Pontus from the Euxine Sea, proceed through 
Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, to Bithynia, where he would re- 
embark for Rome. This, he holds, explains the separation 
of Pontus and Bithynia, though the same province. Only 
Galatia and Asia are mentioned elsewhere in the N.T. as 
having Christian converts, but the N.T. by no means gives 
a full account of the spread of the Gospel, as can be judged 
from Col. 1:6, 23. 

2. According to (kata). Probably to be connected with 
eklektois rather than with apostolos in spite of a rather loose 
arrangement of words and the absence of articles in verses 
1 and 2. The foreknowledge (prognosin). Late substantive 
(Plutarch, Lucian, papyri) from progindsk6é (1:20), to know 
beforehand, only twice in N.T. (here and Acts 2:23 in Peter’s 
sermon). In this Epistle Peter often uses substantives 


80 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


rather than verbs (cf. Rom. 8:29). Of God the Father (theou 
patros). Anarthous again and genitive case. See pater ap- 
plied to God also in 1:3, 17 as often by Paul (Rom. 1:7, etc.). 
Peter here presents the Trinity (God the Father, the Spirit, 
Jesus Christ). In sanctification of the Spirit (en hagiasmot 
pneumatos). Clearly the Holy Spirit, though anarthrous 
like theou patros. Late word from hagiazd, to render holy 
(hagios), to consecrate, as in 1 Thess. 4:7. The subjective 
genitive here, sanctification wrought by the Spirit as in 
2 Thess. 2:13 (where the Trinity mentioned as here). Unto 
obedience (eis hupakoén). Obedience (from hupakoué, to 
hear under, to hearken) to the Lord Jesus as in 1:22 “to 
the truth,” result of “the sanctification.” And sprinkling 
of the blood of Fesus Christ (rantismon haimatos Iésou Chris- 
tou). Late substantive from rantizd, to sprinkle (Heb. 9:13), 
a word used in the LXX of the sacrifices (Numb. 19:9, 13, 
20, etc.), but not in any non-biblical source so far as known, 
in N.T. only here and Heb. 12:24 (of the sprinkling of blood). 
Reference to the death of Christ on the Cross and to the 
ratification of the New Covenant by the blood of Christ as 
given in Heb. g:19f.; 12:24 with allusion to Ex. 24:3-8. 
Paul does not mention this ritual use of the blood of Christ, 
but Jesus does (Matt. 26:28=Mark. 14:24). Hence it is 
not surprising to find the use of it by Peter and the author 
of Hebrews. Hort suggests that Peter may also have.an 
ulterior reference to the blood of the martyrs as in Rev. | 
7:14f.; 12:11, but only as illustration of what Jesus did for 
us, not as having any value. The whole Epistle is a com- 
mentary upon prognosis theou, hagiasmos pneumatos, haima 
Christou (Bigg). Peter is not ashamed of the blood of Christ. 
Be multiplied (pléthuntheié). First aorist passive optative 
(volitive) of pléthund, old verb (from plethus, fulness), in a 
wish. So in II Pet. 1:2 and Jude 2, but nowhere else in 
N.T. salutations. Grace and peace (charis kai eiréné) occur 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 81 


together in II Pet. 1:2, in II John 2 (with e/eos), and in all 
Paul’s Epistles (with e/eos added in I and II Timothy). 

3. Blessed be (eulogétos). No copula in the Greek (estd, 
let be, or estin, is, or eié, may be). The verbal adjective 
(from euloged) occurs in the N.T. only of God, as in the 
LXX (Luke 1:68). See also II Cor. 1:3; Eph. 1:3. The 
God and Father of our Lord Fesus Christ (ho theos kai patér 
tou kuriou hémon Iésou Christou). ‘This precise language in 
II Cor. 1:3; Eph. 1:3; and part of it in II Cor. 11:31, Rom. 
15:6. See John 20:17 for similar language by Jesus. Great 
(polu). Much. Begat us again (anagennésas hemas). First 
aorist active articular (40, who) participle of anagennad, — 
late, and rare word to beget again, in Aleph for Sirach 
(Prol. 20), in Philo, in Hermetic writings, in N.T. only here 
and verse 23. “It was probably borrowed by the New 
Paganism from Christianity” (Bigg). The Stoics used ana- 
gennésis for palingenesia (Titus 3:5). If andthen in John 
3:3 be taken to mean “again,” the same idea of regeneration 
is there, and if “from above” it is the new birth, anyhow. 
Unto a living hope (eis elpida zosan). Peter is fond of the 
word “living” (present active participle of za) as in 1:23; 
2:4, 5, 24; 4:5, 6. The Pharisees cherished the hope of the 
resurrection (Acts 23:6), but the resurrection of Jesus gave 
it proof and permanence (I Cor. 15:14, 17). It is no longer 
a dead hope like dead faith (James 2:17, 26). This revival 
of hope was wrought “by the resurrection of Jesus Christ” 
(dia anastaseos). WHope rose up with Christ from the dead, 
though the disciples (Peter included) were slow at first to 
believe it. 

4. Unto an inheritance (eis kleronomian). Old word (from 
kléronomos, heir) for the property received by the heir 
(Matt. 21:38), here a picture of the blessedness in store for 
us pilgrims (Gal. 3:18). Incorruptible (aphtharton). Old 
compound adjective (alpha privative and phtheird, to cor- 
rupt), imperishable. So many inheritances vanish away 


82 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


before they are obtained. Undefiled (amianton). Old verbal 
adjective (note alliteration) from alpha privative and miainé, 
to defile, without defect or flaw in the title, in N.T. only 
here, Jamcs 1:27; Heb. 13:4. That fadeth not away (ama- 
ranton). Alliterative and verbal adjective again from alpha 
privative and maraino (to dry up, to wither, as in James 
1:11), late and rare word in several inscriptions on tombs, 
here only in N.T. These inscriptions will fade away, but 
not this inheritance in Christ. It will not be like a faded 
rose. Reserved (tetér?emenén). Perfect passive participle of 
téred, old verb, to take care of, to guard. No burglars or 
bandits can break through where this inheritance is kept 
(Matt. 6:19f.; John 17:11f.). Cf. Col. 1:5, where “laid 
away” (apokeimenén) occurs. For you (eis humas). More 
graphic than the mere dative. 

5. By the power of God (en dunamei theou). No other 
dunamis (power) like this (Col. 1:3). Are guarded (phrou- 
roumenous). Present (continuous process) passive articular 
(tous) participle of phroured, to garrison, old verb (from 
phrouros sentinel), a military term (Acts 9:24; II Cor. 
11:32), used of God’s love (Phil. 4:7) as here. “The in- 
heritance is kept; the heirs are guarded” (Bengel). Through 
faith (dia pisteds). Intermediate agency (dia), the immedi- 
ate being (ev, in, by) God’s power. Unto a salvation (eis 
sotérian). Deliverance is the goal (eis) of the process and 
final salvation here, consummation as in I Thess. 5:8, from © 
sotér (Saviour, from 5020, to save). Ready (hetoimén). Pre- 
pared awaiting God’s will (Gal. 3:23; Rom. 8:18). To be 
revealed (apokaluphthenai). First aorist passive infinitive of 
apokalupto, to unveil. Cf. Col. 3:4 for phanerod (to mani- 
fest) in this sense. In the last time (en kairoi eschatoi). 
This precise phrase nowhere else, but similar ones in John 
6:39; Acts 2:17; James 5:3; II Tim. 3:1; II Pet. 3:3; Heb. 
1:2; Jude 18; I John 2:18. Hort translates it here “in a 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER — 83 


season of extremity,” but it is usually taken to refer to the 
Day of Judgment. That day no one knows, Jesus said. 

6. Wherein (en hoi). This translation refers the relative 
hadi to kairdi, but it is possible to see a reference to Christou 
(verse 3) or to theou (verse 5) or even to the entire content 
of verses 3 to 5. Either makes sense, though possibly 
kairdi is correct. Ye greatly rejoice (agalliasthe). Present 
middle indicative (rather than imperative) of agalliaomat, 
late verb from agallomai, to rejoice, only in LXX, N.T., 
and ecclesiastical literature as in Matt. 5:12. Now for a 
little while (oligon arti). Accusative case of time (o/igon) 
probably as in Mark 6:31, though it can be used of space 
(to a small extent) as in Luke 5:3. If need be (ei deon). - 
Present active neuter singular participle of dei (it is neces- 
sary). Some MSS. have estin after deon (periphrastic con- 
struction). Condition of first class. Though ye have been 
put to grief (Jupéthentes). First aorist passive participle 
(concessive circumstantial use) of /uped, to make sorrowful 
(from Jupé, sorrow), old and common verb. See II Cor. 
6:10. In manifold temptations (en poikilois peirasmois). Just 
the phrase in James 1:2, which see for discussion. “Trials” 
clearly right here as there. Seven N.T. writers use potkilos 
(varied). 

7. The proof of your faith (to dokimion humon tes pisteds). 
The identical phrase in James 1:3 and probably derived from 
there by Peter. See there for discussion of to dokimion (the 
test or touchstone of faith). Being more precious (polutimo- 
teron). No word for “‘being” (oz) in the Greek. The sec- 
ondary uncials have polu timidteron. The text is the 
comparative of polutimos, late adjective (Plutarch) from 
polu and timé (of great price) as in Matt. 1 3:46. Than gold 
(chrusiou). Ablative case after the comparative adjective. 
That perisheth (tou apollumenou). Present middle articular 
participle of apollumi to destroy. Even gold perishes (wears 
away). Though it is proved by fire (dia puros de dokimazo- 


84 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


menou). Present passive articular participle (in the ablative 
like chrusiou) of dokimazd (common verb for testing metals) 
with de, which gives a concessive sense to the participle 
Faith stands the test of fire better than gold, but even gold 
is refined by fire. That might be found (hina heurethéi). 
Purpose clause with Aina and the first aorist passive subjunc- 
tive of heuriskd, common verb, to find. As in II Pet. 3:14, 
this is the result of the probation by God as the Refiner of 
hearts. Unto praise and glory and honour (eis epainon kai 
doxan kai timén). Here probably both to God and man in 
the result. Cf. Matt. 5:11f.; Rom. 277,10; )/Mim has. it 
the revelation of Fesus Christ (en apokalupsei Iésou Christou). 
So also in 1:13; 4:13; II Thess. 1:7; I Cor. 1:7; Luke 17:30 of 
the second coming of Christ as the Judge and Rewarder (Bigg). 

8. Whom (hon). Relative referring to Christ just before 
and accusative case, object of both idontes and agapate (ye 
love). Not having seen (ouk idontes). Second aorist active 
participle of horad, to see, with ouk rather than mé because 
it negatives an actual experience in contrast with mé horantes 
(though not seeing, hypothetical case). On whom (eis hon) 
with pisteuontes common construction for “believing on” 
(pisteud eis). It is possible that Peter here has in mind the 
words of Jesus to Thomas as recorded in John 20:29 (““Happy 
are those not seeing and yet believing”). Peter was present 
and heard the words of Jesus to Thomas, and so he could use 
them before John wrote his Gospel. Ye rejoice greatly 
(agalliate). Same form as in verse 6, only active here instead — 
of middle. With joy (charai). Instrumental case (manner). 
Unspeakable (aneklalétoi). Wate and rare double compound 
verbal (alpha privative and eklaled), here only in N.T., in 
Dioscorides and Heliodorus, “unutterable,” like Paul’s 
“indescribable” (anekdiégétos) gift (II Cor. 9:15, here alone 
in N.T.). Full of glory (dedoxasmenéi). Perfect passive 
participle of doxazé, to glorify, “glorified joy,” like the glori- 
fied face of Moses (Ex. 34:20ff.; II Cor. BGs 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER — 85 


g. Receiving (komizomenoi). Present middle participle of 
komizo, old verb, to receive back, to get what is promised 
(5:4; Heb. 10:36). The end of your faith (to telos tés pistes). 
The conclusion, the culmination of faith (II Cor. 3:13; Rom. 
2:21f.; 10:4). See Heb. 12:2 of Jesus as “‘Pioneer and Per- 
fecter of Faith.” Even the salvation of your souls (soterian 
psuchin). No “even” in the text, just the accusative of 
apposition with feos, viz., final salvation. 

10. Concerning which salvation (peri hés sotérias). Another 
relative clause (taking up sdféria from verse g and incorpo- 
rating it) in this long sentence (verses 3 to 12, inclusive, ali 
connected by relatives). Peter lingers over the word sdtérta 
(salvation) with something new to say each time (Bigg). - 
Here it is the general sense of the gospel of grace. Sought 
(exezétésan). First aorist active indicative of ekzéted, to seek 
out (Acts 15:17), late and rare compound, only in LXX and 
N.T. save once in Aristides. Searched diligently (exérauné- 
san). First aorist active indicative of exeraunad, old and 
common compound (exereunad), to search out diligently, 
here only in N.T. Both of these words occur together in 
I Macc. 9:26. Of the grace that should come unto you (peri tes 
eis humas charitos). “Concerning the for you grace” (meant 
for you). 

11. Searching (eraunontes). Present active participle of 
eraunad, late form for older ereunaéd (both in the papyri), 
uncompounded verb (John 7:52), the compound occurring in 
verse 10 above. What time or what manner of time (eis tina é 
poion kairon). Proper sense of poios (qualitative interroga- 
tive) kept here as in I Cor. 15:35, Rom. 3:27, though it is 
losing its distinctive sense from ¢is (Acts 23 334). The 
prophets knew what they prophesied, but not at what time 
the Messianic prophecies would be fulfilled. The Spirit of 
Christ which was in them (to en autois pneuma Christou). 
Peter definitely asserts here that the Spirit of Jesus Christ 
(the Messiah) was in the Old Testament prophets, the Holy 


86 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Spirit called the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God 
(Rom. 8:9), who spoke to the prophets as he would speak ta 
the apostles (John 16:14). Did point unto (edélou). Imper- 
fect active of délod, to make plain, “did keep on pointing to,” 
though they did not clearly perceive the time. When it testi- 
Jied beforehand (promarturomenon). Present middle par- 
ticiple of promarturomai, a late compound unknown else- 
where save in a writer of the fourteenth century (Theodorus 
Mech.) and now in a papyrus of the eighth. It is neuter 
here because pueuma is neuter, but this grammatical gender 
should not be retained as “it” in English, but should be 
rendered “he” (and so as to Acts 8:15). Here we have pre- 
dictive prophecy concerning the Messiah, though some mod- 
ern critics fail to find predictions of the Messiah in the Old 
Testament. The sufferings of Christ (ta eis Christon pathé- 
mata). “The sufferings for (destined for) Christ” like the 
use of ¢is in verse 10 (¢is humas for you). The glories that 
should follow them (tas meta tauta doxas). ‘“‘The after these 
things (sufferings) glories.” The plural of doxa is rare, but 
occurs in Ex. 15:11; Hos. 9:11. The glories of Christ fol- 
lowed the sufferings as in 4:13; 5:1, 6. 

12. To whom (hois). Dative plural of the relative pro- 
noun. To the prophets who were seeking to understand. 
Bigg observes that “the connexion between study and in. 
spiration is a great mystery.” Surely, but that is no argu- 
ment for ignorance or obscurantism. We do the best that 
we can and only skirt the shore of knowledge, as Newton ~ 
said. It was revealed (apekaluphthé). First aorist passive 
indicative of apokaluptd, old verb, to reveal, to unveil. Here 
is revelation about the revelation already received, revelation 
after research. Did they minister (dikonoun). Imperfect 
active of diakoned, old verb, to minister, ‘“‘ were they minister- 
ing.” Have been announced (anéggelé). Second aorist pass- 
ive indicative of anaggellé, to report, to bring back tidings 
(John 4:25). Through them (dia ton). Intermediate agent 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER = 87 


(dia), “the gospelizers” (ton euaggelisamenon, articular first 
aorist middle participle of ewaggelizd, to preach the gospel). 
By the Holy Ghost (pneumati hagidi). Instrumental case of 
the personal agent, “by the Holy Spirit” (without article). 
Sent forth from heaven (apostalenti). Second aorist passive 
participle of apostel/é in instrumental case agreeing with 
pneumati hagidi (the Spirit of Christ of verse 11). Desire 
(epithumousin). Eagerly desire (present active indicative of 
epithumed, to long for). To look into (parakupsai). First 
aorist active infinitive of parakupto, old compound to peer 
into as in Luke 24:12; John 20:5, 11; James 1:25, which see. 
For the interest of angels in the Incarnation see Luke 2:13f. 

13. Wherefore (dio). ‘Because of which thing,” the glo- ~ 
rious free grace opened for Gentiles and Jews in Christ 
(verses 3-12). Girding up (anazdsamenoi). First aorist 
middle participle of anazdnnumi, late and rare verb (Judges 
18:16; Prov. 29:35; 31:17), here only in N.T., vivid metaphor 
for habit of the Orientals, who quickly gathered up their 
loose robes with a girdle when in a hurry or starting on a 
journey. The loins (tas osphuas). Old word for the part of 
the body where the girdle (zd”@) was worn. Metaphor here 
as in Luke 12:35; Eph. 6:14. Mind (dianoias). Old word 
for the faculty of understanding, of seeing through a thing 
(dia, noed) as in Matt. 22:37. Be sober (néphontes). “‘ Being 
sober” (present active participle of néphd, old verb, but in 
N.T. always as metaphor (I Thess. 5:6, 8, etc., and so in 4:7). 
Perfectly (teleids). Adverb, old word (here alone in N.T.), 
from adjective teleios (perfect), connected with e/pisate (set 
your hope, first aorist active imperative of e/pizd) in the 
Revised Version, but Bigg, Hort, and most modern com- 
mentators take it according to Peter’s usual custom with the 
preceding verb, néphontes (“being perfectly sober,” not 
“hope perfectly”). That is to be brought (ten pheromenén). 
Present passive articular participle of phero, picturing the 


88 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


process, ‘that is being brought.” For “revelation” (apoka- 
lupsei) see end of verse 7. 

14. 4s children of obedience (hos tekna hupakoés). A 
common Hebraism (descriptive genitive frequent in LXX 
and N.T., like huioi tés apeitheias, children of disobedience, 
in Eph. 2:2) suggested by Aupakoén in verse 2, “children 
marked by obedience.” Not fashioning yourselves (mé 
sunschematizomenoi). Usual negative mé with the par- 
ticiple (present direct middle of sunschématizo, a rare (Aris- 
totle, Plutarch) compound (sun, schématizd, from schema 
from echo), in N.T. only here and Rom. 12:2 (the outward 
pattern in contrast with the inward change metamorphod). 
See Phil. 2:6f. for contrast between schéma (pattern) and 
morphé (form). According to your former lusts (tais proteron 
epithumiais). Associative instrumental case after sunsché- 
matizomenoi and the bad sense of epithumia as in 4:2; II Pet. 
1:4; James 1:14f. In the time of your ignorance (en tei agnoiai 
humon). “In your ignorance,” but in attributive position 
before “lusts.” Agnoia (from agnoed, to be ignorant) is old 
word, in N.T. only here, Acts 3:17; 17:30; Eph. 4:18. 

15. But like as he which called you is holy (alla kata ton 
kalesanta humas hagion). ‘This use of kata is a regular Greek 
idiom (here in contrast with sunschématizomenoi). “But 
according to the holy one calling you or who called you” 
(first aorist articular participle of kaled, to call). God is our 
standard or pattern (kata), not our lusts. Be ye yourselves 
also holy (kai autoi hagioi genéthéte). First aorist (ingressive) 
passive imperative of ginomai, to become with allusion (kai 
also) to kata (God as our example), “Do ye also become 
holy.” For anastrophé (manner of life) see verse 18; 2:12; 
3:1-16; James 3:13; II Pet. 2:7. Peter uses anastrophé eight 
times. The original meaning (turning up and down, back 
and forth) suited the Latin word conversatio (converto), but 
not our modern “conversation” (talk, not walk). 

16. Because it is written (dioti gegraptai). ‘‘Because (dioti 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 89 


stronger than hofi below) it stands written” (regular formula 
for O.T. quotation, perfect passive indicative of graph). 
The quotation is from Lev. 11:44; 19:2; 20:7. Reénforced 
by Jesus in Matt. 5:48. The future esesthe here is volitive like 
an imperative. 

17. If ye call (ei epikaleisthe). Condition of first class and 
present middle indicative of epikaleo, to call a name on, to 
name (Acts 10:18). 4s Father (patera). Predicate accusa- 
tive in apposition with ton—krinonta. Without respect of 
persons (aprosopolémptos). Found nowhere else except in 
the later Ep. of Clem. of Rome and Ep. of Barn., from 
alpha privative and prosopolemptes (Acts 10:34. See James 
2:9 for prosdpolempted and 2:1 for prosdpolémpsia) from 
prosdpon lambano (in imitation of the Hebrew). According 
to each man’s work (kata to hekastou ergon). ‘According to 
the deed of each one” God judges (krinonta) just as Christ 
judges also (II Cor. 5:10). Pass (anastraphéte). Second 
aorist passive imperative of anastrephod, metaphorical sense 
as in II Cor. 1:12; 2 Pet. 2:18. The time (ton chronon). 
Accusative case of extent of time. Of your sojourning (tés 
paroikias humon). A late word, found in LXX (Ps. 119:5) 
and in N.T. only here and Acts 13:17 and in ecclesiastical 
writers (one late Christian inscription). It comes from 
paroiked, old verb, to dwell beside (in one’s neighbourhood), 
and so of pilgrims or strangers (paroikos Acts 7:6) as of 
Jews away from Palestine or of Christians here on earth, 
then of a local region (our “‘parish’””). Peter here recurs 
to 1:1 (“‘sojourners of the Dispersion”). In fear (en phobii). 
Emphatic position at beginning of the clause with ana- 
straphéte at the end. . 

18. Knowing (eidotes). Second perfect active participle 
of oida, causal participle. The appeal is to an elementary 
Christian belief (Hort), the holiness and justice of God with 
the added thought of the high cost of redemption (Bigg). 
Ye were redeemed (elutrothete). First aorist passive indica- 


go WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


tive of Jutrod, old verb from /utron (ransom for life as of a 
slave, Matt. 20:28), to set free by payment of ransom, 
abundant examples in the papyri, in N.T. only here, Luke 
24:21; Titus 2:14. The ransom is the blood of Christ. 
Peter here amplifies the language in Is. 52:3f. Not with cor- 
ruptible things (ou phthartois). Instrumental case neuter 
plural of the late verbal adjective from phtheird to destroy 
or to corrupt, and so perishable, in N.T. here, verse 23; 
I Cor. 9:25; 15:53f.; Rom. 1:23. Argurioi é chrusioi (silver 
or gold) are in explanatory apposition with phthartois and 
so in the same case. Slaves were set free by silver and 
gold. From your vain manner of life (ek tés mataias humon 
anastrophés). “Out of” (ek), and so away from, the pre- 
Christian anastrophé of verse 15, which was “vain” (mataias. 
Cf. Eph. 4:17-24). Handed down from your fathers (patro- 
paradotou). This adjective, though predicate in position, is 
really attributive in idea, like cheiropoiétou in Eph, 2:11 
(Robertson, Grammar, p. 777), like the French idiom. This 
double compound verbal adjective (pater, para, didomi), 
though here alone in N.T., occurs in Diodorus, Dion. Halic. 
and in several i ciseaad (Moulton and Milligan’s Vocad- 
ulary; Deissmann, Bible Studies, pp. 266f.). The Jews made 
a wrong use of tradition (Matt. 15:2ff.), but the reference 
here seems mainly to Gentiles (1 Pet. 2:12). 

19. But with precious blood (alla timidi haimati). Instru- 
mental case of haima after elutrothéte (repeated from verse 
18). Peter here applies the old adjective timios (from timé, 
of Christ in I Pet. 2:7) to Christ as in 1:7 polutimoteron to 
testing of faith. The blood of anyone is “precious” (costly), 
far above gold or silver, but that of Jesus immeasurably 
more so. 4s of a lamb (hos amnou). This word occurs in 
Lev. 12:8; Numb. 15:11; Deut. 14:4 of the lamb prescribed 
for the passover sachifice (Ex. 12:5). John the Baptist ap- 
plies it to Jesus (John 1:29, 36). It occurs also in Acts 
8:32 quoted from Is. 53:7f. Undoubtedly both the Baptist 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 1 


and Peter have this passage in mind. Elsewhere in the 
N.T. arnion is used of Christ (Rev. 5:6, 12). Jesus is the 
Paschal Lamb. Peter sees clearly that it was by the blood 
of Christ that we are redeemed from sin. Without blemish 
(amomou). Without (alpha privative) spot (mdmos) as the 
paschal lamb had to be (Lev. 22:21). So Heb. 9:14. With- 
out spot (aspilou). Without (alpha privative) stain (spilos 
spot) as in James 1:27; II Pet. 3:14; I Pet. 6:14. Even the 
blood of Christ (Christou). Genitive case with haimati, but 
in unusual position for emphasis and clearness with the 
participles following. 

20. Who was foreknown indeed (proegnosmenou men). Per-. 
fect passive participle (in genitive singular agreeing with 
Christou) of progindské, old verb, to know beforehand (Rom. 
8:29; Ii Pet. 3:17). See progndsin theou in verse 2. Before 
the foundation of the world (pro katabolés kosmou). This 
precise curious phrase occurs in John 17:24 in the Saviour’s 
mouth of his preincarnate state with the Father as here 
and in Eph. 1:4. We have apo kataboles kosmou in Matt. 
25:34 (kosmou omitted in Matt. 13:35); Luke 11:50; Heb. 
4:33 9:26; Rev. 13:8; 17:8. Katabolé (from kataballo) was 
originally laying the foundation of a house (Heb. 6:1). The 
preincarnate Messiah appears in the counsels of God also 
in I Cor. 2:7; Col. 1:26f.; Eph. r:9f; 3:9-11; Rom. 16:25; 
I Tim. 1:9. But was manifested (phanerothentos de). First 
aorist (ingressive) passive participle of phanerod, referring 
to the Incarnation in contrast with the preéxistence of 
Christ (cf. John 1:31; I John 3:5, 8). 4t the end of the times 
(ep’ eschatou ton chronon). Like ep’ eschatou ton hémeron 
(Heb. 1:2). The plural chronoi, doubtless referring to suc- 
cessive periods in human history until the fullness of the 
time came (Gal. 4:4). For your sake (di? humds). Proof 
of God’s love, not of their desert or worth (Acts 17:30f.; 
Heb. 11:39f.). 

21. Who through him are believers in God (tous di’ autou 


92 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


pistous eis theon). Accusative case in apposition with humas 
(you), ‘“‘the through him (that is Christ as in 1:8 and. Acts 
3:16) believers (pistous correct text of A B) in God.” Which 
raised (ton egeiranta). Accusative singular articular (agree- 
ing with ¢heon) first aorist active participle of egeird (cf. 
di’ anastaseos Iésou in verse 3). Gave glory to him (doxan 
autoi donta). Second aorist active participle of didomi agree- 
ing also with theon. See Peter’s speech in Acts 3:13 about 
God glorifying (edoxasen) Jesus and also the same idea by 
Peter in Acts 2:33-36; 5:31. So that your faith and hope 
might be in God (hoste ten pistin humon kai elpida eis theon). 
Hoste with the infinitive (einai) and the accusative of gen- 
eral reference (pistin kai elpida) is used in the N.T. as in 
the Koiné for either purpose (Matt. 10:1) or usually result 
(Mark 4:37). Hence here result (so that is) is more prob- 
able than design. 

22. Seeing ye have purified (hégnikotes). Perfect active 
participle of hagnizd, old verb from hagnos (pure), here with 
psuchas. (souls), with kardias (hearts) in James 4:8 as in 
I John 3:3 of moral cleansing also. See the ceremonial 
sense of the word as in LXX in John 11:55; Acts 21:24, 26; 
24:18. In your obedience (en téi hupakoéi). With repetition 
of the idea in 1:2, 2:14 (children of obedience). To the 
truth (tés aletheias). Objective genitive with which compare 
John 17:17, 19 about sanctification in the truth and 2 Thess. 
2:12 about believing the truth. There is cleansing power 
in the truth of God in Christ. Unfeigned (anupokriton). 
Late and rare double compound, here alone in Peter, but 
see James 3:17; II Cor. 6:6, etc. No other kind of phila. 
delphia (brotherly love) is worth having (I Thess. 4:9; Heb. 
13:1; II Pet. 1:7). From the heart fervently (ek kardias 
ektenos). Late adverb (in inscriptions, Polybius, LXX). 
The adjective ektenés is more common (I Pet. 4:8). 

23. Having been begotten again (anagegennémenoi). Per- 
fect passive participle of anagennad, which see in verse 2. 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER _ 93 


Not of corruptible seed (ouk ek sporas phthartés). Ablative 
with ek as the source, for phthartos see verse 18, and sporas 
(from speird to sow), old word (sowing, seed) here only in 
N.T., though sporos in Mark 4:26f., etc. For “‘incorrupt- 
ible” (aphthartou) see verse 4, 3:4. Through the word of God 
(dia logou theou). See James 1:18 for “by the word of 
truth,” verse 25 here, and Peter’s use of Jogos in Acts 10:36. 
It is the gospel message. Which liveth and abideth (zontos 
kai menontos). ‘These present active participles (from 240 
and meno) can be taken with ¢heou (God) or with Jogou 
(word). In verse 25 menei is used with réma (word). Still 
in Dan. 6:26 both menon and z6n are used with theos. Either - 
construction makes sense here. 

24f. Quotation from Is. 40:6-8 (partly like the LXX, 
partly like the Hebrew). For (dioti). As in verse 16 (dia 
and oti), ‘“‘for that.” So in 2:6. See a free use of this 
imagery about the life of man as grass and a flower in James 
1:11. The best MSS. here read autés (thereof) after doxa 
(glory) rather than anthropou (of man). Withereth (ex- 
éranthé). First aorist (gnomic, timeless) passive indicative 
of xéraind (see James 1:11). Falleth (exepesen). Second 
aorist (gnomic, timeless) active indicative of ekpiptd (see 
James 1:11). In verse 25 note eis humds (unto you) like 
eis humdas in 1:4 (=humin dative). 


CHAPTER II 


1. Putting away therefore (apothemenoi oun). Second aorist 
middle participle of apotithémi, old and common verb, in 
metaphorical sense either to cleanse defilements (3:21; James 
1:21) or to put off clothing (Rom. 13:12; Col. 3:5ff.; Eph. 
4:22). Either sense suits here. Therefore (oun) because of 
the new birth (1:23) and the new life demanded. Wicked- 
ness (kakian). This old word, from kakos (evil), in the an- 
cients meant vice of any kind and note pasan (all) here. 
Guile (dolon). Old word (from de/é, to catch with bait), 
deceit. Hypocrisies (hupokriseis). Singular (hupokrisin) in 
the best MSS. See 1:22 (anupokriton) and Mark 7:6f. for 
Christ’s denunciation of hypocrites which the disciples did 
not understand, including Peter (Matt. 15:16ff.). Envies 
(phthonous). Genuine here, not phonous (murders), as B 
has it. For the word see Matt. 27:18. Evil speakings 
(katalalias). Late word (from katalalos, defamer, Rom. 1:30), 
in N.T. only here and II Cor. 12:20. “Backbitings.” For 
verb see 2:12. 

2. 4s newborn babes (hos artigennéta brephé). Brephos, 
old word, originally unborn child (Luke 1:41, 44), then in- 
fant (Luke 2:12), here figuratively, like népioi. Artigennéta - 
is a late and rare compound (Lucian, imperial inscription) 
from arti and gennad, with evident allusion to anagegen- 
némenoi in 1:23, probably meaning that they were recent 
converts, possibly slight proof that the Epistle written be- 
fore Romans by Paul (Kuhl). Long Jor (epipothésate). First 
aorist (constative) active imperative of epipothed, old verb 
for intense yearning (Phil. 2:26). The spiritual milk which 
is without guile (to logikon adolon gala). Gala is old word 
for milk as in I Cor. 9:7 and as metaphor in I Cor. 3:2. 

94 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 95 


Adolos is an old compound (here alone in N.T.) adjective 
(alpha privative and do/os deceit), unadulterated milk which, 
alas, is so hard to get. Logikon is an old adjective in -ikos, 
from Jogos (reason, speech), in N.T. only here and Rom. 
12:1, used here with allusion to /ogou (1:23) and réma (1:25), 
“the sincere milk of the word” (“‘the milk belonging to the 
word,” either the milk which is the word or the milk con- 
tained in the word, that is Christ). So Bigg holds. But 
in Rom. 12:1 Paul uses /ogikon in the sense of ‘‘rational” 
or ‘“‘spiritual,” and that idea is possible here as Hort holds. 
In the Pelagia legend (Usener) we have the phrase son 
logikén probaton tou Christou (the spiritual or rational sheep . 
of Christ). That ye may grow thereby (hina en autoi auxé- 
thete). Purpose clause with hina and the first aorist passive 
subjunctive of auxand, old and common verb to grow. See 
this same metaphor in Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:15. Peter uses the 
word of God as the food for growth, especially for babes in 
Christ, not emphasizing the distinction from solid food 
(broma) made in I Cor. 3:2; Heb. 5:13. Salvation (sdtérian) 
here is final salvation. 

3. If ye have tasted (ei egeusasthe). Condition of first class 
with ei and first aorist middle indicative of geué in figurative 
sense as in Heb.6:4f. “‘A taste excites the appetite” (Bengel). 
Gracious (chréstos). Quotation from Ps. 33(34):9. The 
Hebrew for the LXX chréstos is simply tobh (good). Plato 
used the word for food also, and Peter carries out the meta- 
phor in gala (milk) as in Luke 5:39. 

4. Unto whom (pros hon). The Lord, carrying on the 
imagery and language of the Psalm. Coming (prosercho- 
menoi). Present middle participle masculine plural of pro- 
serchomai (proselthate in the Psalm) agreeing with the subject 
of oikodomeisthe. A living stone (lithon zdnta). Accusative 
case in apposition with on (whom, the Lord Christ). There 
is apparent an intentional contradiction between “living” 
and ‘“‘stone.” Cf. “living hope” in 1:3 and “living word” 


96 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


in 1:23. Rejected indeed of men (hupo anthropon men apode- 
dokimasmenon). Perfect passive participle of apodokimazé, 
old verb to repudiate after test (Luke 9:22), in the accusative 
case agreeing with lithon. But with God (para de thedi). “By 
the side of God,” as he looks at it, in contrast with the rejec- 
tion “by men” (hupo anthropon). Elect (eklekton). From 
Is. 28:6 as in entimon (precious, for which see Luke 7:2) 
rather than dokimon (proved) expected after apodedoki- 
masmenon as meaning far more in God’s sight, ‘“‘a pre- 
eminence of position with” (Hort). 

5. Ye also as living stones (kai autoi hos lithoi zontes). 
Peter applies the metaphor about Christ as the living stone 
to the readers, “‘ye yourselves also.” Are built up a spiritual 
house (otkodomeisthe oikos pneumatikos). Present passive 
indicative second person plural of oikodomed, the very verb 
used by Jesus to Peter in Matt. 16:18 (oikodomésd) of build- 
ing his church on the rock. If the metaphor of a house of 
living stones seems “‘violent” (Vincent), it should be remem- 
bered that Jesus employed the figure of a house of believers. 
Peter just carried it a bit farther and Paul uses a temple for 
believers in one place (I Cor. 3:16) and for the kingdom of 
God in general (Eph. 2:22), as does the author of Hebrews 
(3:6). This “spiritual house” includes believers in the five 
Roman provinces of 1:1 and shows clearly how Peter under- 
stood the metaphor of Christ in Matt. 16:18 to be not a local 
church, but the church general (the kingdom of Christ). 
To be a holy priesthood (eis hierateuma hagion). Late word 
(from hierateud, to serve as priest, Luke 1:8 alone in N.T.), in 
LXX (Ex. 19:6), in N.T. only here and verse 9, either the 
office of priest (Hort) or an order or body of priests. At any 
rate, Peter has the same idea of Rev. 1:6 (hiereis, priests) 
that all believers are priests (Heb. 4:16) and can approach 
God directly. To offer up (anenegkai). First aorist active 
infinitive (of purpose here) of anapherd, the usual word for 
offering sacrifices (Heb. 7:27). Only: these are: “spiritual” 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 97 


(pneumatikas) as pictured also in Heb. 13:15f. Acceptable 
(euprosdektous). Late (Plutarch) double compound verbal 
adjective (eu, pros, dechomai) as in II Cor. 6:2. 

6. It is contained (periechei). Present active (here intransi- 
tive, to contain, only N.T. example) of periechd, old verb, to 
surround, transitive in Luke 5:9 to seize (only other N.T. 
example). The formula with periechei is in Josephus (Ant. 
XI. 7). This Scripture (en graphéi) is Is. 28:16 with some 
changes. Peter had in verse 4 already quoted ek/ekton and 
entimon. Now note akrogoniaion (a chief corner stone), a 
word apparently invented by Isaiah (from akros, highest, and 
goniaios, Attic word for corner stone). Paul in Eph. 2:20 _ 
uses the same word, making Christ the chief corner stone 
(the only other N.T. example). In Isaiah the metaphor is 
rather a foundation stone. Peter and Paul make it “‘the 
primary foundation stone at the structure” (W. W. Lloyd). 
On him (ep’autdi). That is, “on it” (this corner stone, that is, 
Christ). Shall not be put to shame (ou mé kataischunthéi). 
Strong negatives ou mé with first aorist passive subjunctive 
of kataischund, old verb, to put to shame (Rom. 5:5). 

7. The preciousness (hé timé). Or “the honour.” Expla- 
nation of entimon and ou mé kataischunthéi and only true 
“for you which believe” (tois pisteuousin ethical dative of 
articular present active participle of pisteud to believe). But 
for such as disbelieve (apistousin de). Dative present active. 
participle again of apisted, opposite of pisteud (Luke 24:11). 
Was made the head of the corner (egenéthé eis kephalén gonias). 
This verse is from Ps..118:22 with evident allusion to Is. 
28:16 (kephalén gonias =akrogoniaion). See Matt. 21:42= 
Mark 12:10=Luke 20:17, where Jesus himself quotes Ps. 
118:22 and applies the rejection of the stone by the builders 
(hoi oikodomountes, the experts) to the Sanhedrin’s conduct 
toward him. Peter quoted it also (and applied it as Jesus 
had done) in his speech at the Beautiful Gate (Acts 4:11). 
Here he quotes it again to the same purpose. 


98 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


8. And (kai). Peter now quotes Is. 8:14 and gives a new 
turn to the previous quotation. To the disbelieving, Christ 
was indeed ‘‘a stone of stumbling (/ithos proskommatos) and 
rock of offence (petra skandalou),” quoted also by Paul in 
Rom. 9:32f., which see for discussion. Proskomma (from 
proskopto, to cut against) is an obstacle against which one 
strikes by accident, while skandalon is a trap set to trip one, 
but both make one fall. Too much distinction need not be 
made between /Jithos (a loose stone in the path) and petra 
(a ledge rising out of the ground). For they (hoi). Causal 
use of the relative pronoun. Stumble at the word, being disobe- 
dient (proskoptousin toi logoi apeithountes). Present active 
indicative of proskopté with dative case, Jogoi, and present 
active participle of apeithed (cf. apistousin in 2:7) as in 3:1. 
Toi logoi can be construed with apeithountes (stumble, being 
disobedient to the word). Whereunto also they were appointed 
(eis ho kai etethésan). First aorist passive indicative of 
tithemi. See this idiom in I Tim. 2:7. ‘‘Their disobedience 
is not ordained, the penalty of their disobedience is” (Bigg). 
They rebelled against God and paid the penalty. 

9. But ye (humeis de). In contrast with the disobedient 
ones. n elect race (genos eklekton). From Is. 43:20. The 
blood relation of the spiritual Israel (not the Jewish race) 
through the new birth (1:23). 4 royal priesthood (basileion 
hierateuma). From Ex. 19:6 (cf. Rev. 1:6; 5:10). The 
official in Christian churches is preshuteros =episcopos, not . 
hiereus. We are all hiereis (priests). Cf.2:5. 4 holy nation 
(ethnos hagion). Also from Ex. 19:6, but here applied, not to 
the national Israel, but to the spiritual Israel of believers 
(both Jews and Gentiles). 4 people for God’s own possession 
(Jaos eis peripoiésin). The idea here occurs in Ex. 19:5; 
Deut. 7:6; 14:2; 26:18, where we have /aos periousios as in 
Titus 2:14 (alone in the N.T.), and in Mal. 3:17 we find 
eis peripoiésin (for a possession). Periousios laos is a people 
over and above the others and peripoiésis is a possession in a 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 99 


special sense (Eph. 1:14). See Paul’s use of periepoiésato in 

Acts 20:28. The old rendering, “a peculiar people,” had this 

idea of possession, for “peculiar” is from pecus (Latin for 

flock). That ye may shew forth (hopos exaggeiléte). Purpose 
clause with Aopés, rather than hina, with the first aorist active 
subjunctive of exaggelld, old verb, to tell out, here alone 
in N.T. The excellencies (tas aretas). From Is. 43:21. Old 
word for any preéminence (moral, intellectual, military), 
often for “‘virtue,” but not in that sense in the O.T. or the 
N.T. The word has the sense of moral worth in II Pet. 

1:3, 5; Phil. 4:8; and the Apocrypha. Jn Isaiah (here quoted) 

it means praise and glory to God. So also Is. 42:12. See. 
Acts 2:11 ta megaleia tou theou (the mighty works of God). 

Darkness (skotous). Heathenism. His marvellous light ‘(to 

thaumaston autou phos). Christianity. For thaumaston (from 

thaumazo) see Matt. 21:42. For the change from heathenism 
to Christianity see Col. 1:12; Eph. 5:8-14. 

10. Which in time past (hoi pote). “‘Who once upon a 
time.” No people (ou laos). This phrase from Hos. 2:23. 
Note use of ou (not oudeis) with Jaos like Hebrew negative. 
Which had not obtained mercy (hoi ouk eleeémenoi). Perfect 
passive articular participle of e/eed and the emphatic negative 
ou, with which compare Paul’s use of Hos. 1 and 2:in Rom. 
9:25, which may have been known to Peter or not. But now 
have obtained mercy (nun de eleéthentes). Change to first 
aorist passive participle from “the long antecedent state” to 
“the single event of conversion which ended it” (Hort). 

11. As sojourners and pilgrims (hos paroikous kai parept- 
demous). This combination from the LXX (Gen. 33:4; 
Ps. 39:13). See 1:1 for parepid@mos and 1:17 for paroikia 
and Eph. 2:19 for paroikos (only there and here in N.T., 
Christians whose fatherland is heaven). To abstain from 
(apechesthai). Present middle (direct) infinitive of apeché, 
old verb, to hold back from (I Thess. 4:3). In indirect com- 
mand (to keep on abstaining from) after parakald (1 beseech). 


100 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


With the ablative case ¢6n sarkikin epithumion, the grosser 
sins of the flesh (for sarkikos see I Cor. 3:3) like the list in 4:3. 
Which (haitines). “‘Which very ones.” Like Latin guippe 
qui. War against the soul (strateuontai kata tes psuchés). 
Present middle indicative of strateud, to carry on a campaign 
(James 4:1). See this struggle between the flesh and the 
spirit vividly pictured by Paul in Gal. 5:16-24. 

12. Seemly (kalén). Predicate adjective with anastrophén, 
for which see 1:15, 18. The Gentiles are on the watch for 
slips in moral conduct by the Christians. That (hina). 
Final conjunction with doxasdsin (they may glorify, first 
aorist active subjunctive of doxazd, the purpose of the Chris- 
tians about the Gentiles. Wherein (en hoi).. “In what 
thing.” 4s evil-doers (hos kakopoion). As they did and do, 
old word (from kakon and poied, John 18:30), in N.T. only 
here and verse 14 in correct text. Heathen talk against us 
(katalalousin) gleefully. By your good works (ek tin kalin 
ergon). ‘“Out of (asa result of) your good (beautiful) deeds.” 
Which they behold (epopteuontes). Present active participle 
of epopteud, old verb (from, epopéés, overseer, spectator, II Pet. 
1:16), to be an overseer, to view carefully, in N.T. only here 
and 3:2. In the day of visitation (en hémerai episkopés). 
From Is. 10:33. Cf. its use in Luke 19:44, which see for 
the word episkopé (from episkoped, to inspect (Heb. 12:15). 
Clear echo here of Matt. 5:16. 

13. Be subject to (hupotagéte). Second aorist passive im- 
perative second person plural of hupotassé, to subject to, as in 
3:22. Every ordinance of man (paséi anthropinéi ktisei). 
Dative case of old and common word kfisis (from ktizd, to 
create, to found), act of creation (Rom. 1:20), a creature or 
creation (Rom. 1:25), all creation (Col. 1:15), an institution 
as here (in Pindar so). For anthropinos (human) see James 
3:7. Peter here approves no special kind of government, but 
he supports law and order as Paul does (Rom. 13:1-8) unless 
it steps in between God and man (Acts 4:20). For the Lord’s 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER . 1o1 


sake (dia ton kurion). For Jesus’ sake. That is reason 
enough for the Christian not to be an anarchist (Matt. 22:21). 
The heathen were keen to charge the Christians with any 
crime after Nero set the fashion. ‘It should not be forgot- 
ten that, in spite of the fine language of the philosophers, the 
really popular religions in Greece and Rome were forms of 
devil-worship, intimately blended with magic in all its 
grades” (Bigg). As supreme (hos huperechonti). Dative 
singular of present active participle of huperechd, old verb 
(intransitive), to stand out above (to have it over), as in 
Rom. 13:1. It is not the divine right of kings, but the fact 
of the king as the outstanding ruler. 

14. Unto governors (hégemosin). Dative again of hégemon, 
aleader (from hégeomai, to lead), oldand common word (Matt. 
10:18). As sent by him (hos di’ autou pempomenois). Present 
passive participle of pempéd. Di’autou is “by God,” as Jesus 
made plain to Pilate; even Pilate received his authority ultt- 
mately “from above” (John 18:11). For vengeance on evil- 
doers (eis ekdikésin kakopoion). Objective genitive with 
ekdikésin, for which see Luke 18:7f. For praise to them that 
do well (epainon agathopoion). Objective genitive again, 
agathopoios, a late word (Plutarch, Sirach) from agathon and 
poied here only in N.T. Found in a magical papyrus. 

15. By well-doing (agathopoiountas). Present active par- 
ticiple of agathopoied, only in LXX and N.T. (Mark 3:4). 
In accusative case agreeing with humds understood, accusa- 
tive of general reference with phimoin, present active infini- 
tive (epexegetic infinitive after to thel@ma tou theou, the will of 
God), late and rare verb (from phimos muzzle), as in Matt. 
22:12. The ignorance of foolish men (tén ton aphronon 
anthropon agnosian). Agnosia is late and rare word (in the 
papyri) from alpha privative and gnosis (knowledge), in 
N.T. only here and I Cor. 15:24 (disgraceful ignorance in 
both instances). Note alliteration. 

16. As free (hos eleutheroi). Note nominative again con- 


102 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


nected with Aupotagéte in verse 13, not with phimoin in 
verse 14 (a parenthesis in fact). For this ethical sense of 
eleutheros see Gal. 4:26. And not using your freedom (kai 
mé echontes tén eleutherian). ‘“‘And not holding your lib- 
erty” (present active participle of echd, with usual negative 
mé with participle. For a cloke of wickedness (hos eptka- 
lumma tes kakias). Epikalumma (from epikaluptd Rom. 4:7) 
is a rare word (Aristotle, LXX) for veil, here only in N.T. 
and in figurative sense for pretext to do wickedness under, 
a thing, alas, that sometimes happens. But as bondservants 
of God (all’ hos theou douloi). Paul’s proud title. There is 
no such thing as absolute freedom (personal freedom), for 
that is anarchy. Cf. Rom. 6:22 “enslaved to God.” 

17. Honour all men (pantas timésate). Not with the same 
honour. Constative use of the aorist imperative. Love the 
brotherhood (tén adelphoteta agapate). Present active impera- 
tive of agapad, keep on doing it. Note the abstract adel- 
photés (from adelphos, brother) in the collective sense, rare 
save in ecclesiastical literature, though in I Macc. 12:10; 
IV Macc. 10:3, and in late papyri. It is a word fer all 
Christians. Fear God (ton theon phobeisthe). In both senses 
of reverence and dread, and keep it up (present middle im- 
perative). Honour the king (ton basilea timate). Keep that 
up also. A fine motto in this verse. 

18. Servants (hoi oiketai). Note article with the class as 
with andres (3:7), though not with gunaikes (3:1). Ozketés, 
old word from oikos (house), means one in the same house 
with another (Latin domesticus), particularly house servants 
(slaves) in distinction from the general term doulos (slave). 
“Ye domestics.” See similar directions to Christian serv- 
ants (slaves) in Col. 3:22-25; Eph. 6:5-7; I Tim. 6:1f.; 
Titus 2:9f. Oiketés in N.T. occurs only here, Luke 16:13; 
Acts 10:7; Rom. 14:4. Be in subjection (hupotassomenot). 
Present middle participle of Aupotassd. common late com- 
pound to subject oneself to one (Luke 2:51). Either the 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 103 


participle is here used as an imperative (so in 3:1, 7) as in 
Rom. 12:16f., or the imperative este has to be supplied 
(Robertson, Grammar, p. 945). To your masters (tois des- 
potais). Dative case of despotés, old word for absolute owner 
in contrast with doulos. It is used also of God (Luke 2:29; 
Acts 4:24, 29) and of Christ (II Pet. 2:1; Jude 4). Kurios 
has a wider meaning and not necessarily suggesting absolute 
power. To the good and gentle (tois agathois kai epietkesin). 
Dative case also with the article with class. For epieikés 
see on James 3:17. There were slave-owners (masters) like 
this as there are housekeepers and employers of workmen 
today. This is no argument for slavery, but only a side- - 
light on a condition bad enough at its best. To the froward 
(tois skoliois). ‘‘To the crooked.” Old word, also in Luke 
3:5; Acts 2:40; Phil. 2:15. Unfortunately there were slave- 
holders as there are employers today, like this group. The 
test of obedience comes precisely toward this group. 

19. For this is acceptable (touto gar charis). “For this 
thing (neuter singular fouto, obedience to crooked masters) 
is grace” (charis is feminine, here “thanks” as in Rom. 
7:25). “‘Acceptable” calls for euprosdekton (2:5), which is 
not the text here. Jf a man endureth griefs (ei huopheret 
tis lupas). Condition of first class with ez and present ac- 
tive indicative of hupopherd, old verb, to bear up under, in 
N.T. only here, I Cor. 10:13; II Tim. 3:11. Note plural 
of lupé (grief). For conscience toward God (dia sunetdésin 
theou). Suffering is not a blessing in and of itself, but, if 
one’s duty to God is involved (Acts 4:20), then one can 
meet it with gladness of heart. Theou (God) is objective 
genitive. For suneidésis (conscience) see on Acts 23:1; I 
Cor. 8:7. It occurs again in I Pet. 3:16. Suffering wrong- 
fully (paschin adikos). Present active participle of paschd 
and the common adverb adikés, unjustly, here alone in N.T, 
This is the whole point, meade clear already by Jesus in 


1o4 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Matt. 5:10-12, where Jesus has also “falsely” (pseudo- 
menoi). See also Luke 6:32-34. 

20. For what glory (poion gar kleos). Qualitative inter- 
rogative (what kind of glory). ‘‘What price glory?” Kleos 
is old word from k/eo (kaled, to call), report, praise, glory, 
here only in N.T. Jf ye shall take it patiently (ei hupome- 
neite). First-class condition with ei and future active in- 
dicative of hupomeno, for which see James 1:12. Same 
condition also in next sentence (a/l’ ei, etc.). When ye sin 
(hamartanontes). Present active participle of hamartané (con- 
tinued repetition). And are buffeted for it (kai kolaphizo- 
menoi). Present passive participle of kolaphizd, late word 
(from kolaphos fist), only in N.T. (cf. Matt. 26:67) and 
ecclesiastical writers. Repeated action again. No posing 
as a martyr allowed here. Christians do sometimes deserve 
persecution, as Jesus implied (Matt. 5:10-12). When ye do 
well (agathopoiountes). Present active participle of agatho- 
poied as in verse 15. And suffer for it (kai paschontes). 
Present active participle of paschd (verse 19). No “for it” 
in the Greek here or in the previous sentence. This is ac- 
ceptable with God (touto charis para theoi). ‘‘This thing 
(neuter) is thanks (verse 19) by the side of (para) God (as 
God looks at it).” 

21. For hereunto were ye called (eis touto gar eklethéte). 
First aorist indicative of kaled, to call. They were called to 
suffer without flinching (Hort), if need be. Because (hoti). . 
The fact that Christ suffered (epathen) lifts their suffering 
to a new plane. Leaving you an example (humin hupolimp- 
anon hupogrammon). Present active participle of the late 
Ionic verb hupolimpané (in the papyri) for the common 
hupoleipo, to leave behind (under), here only in N.T. Hupo- 
grammos is also a late and rare word (from hupographd, to 
write under), a writing-copy for one to imitate, in II Macc. 
2:28; Philo, Clement of Rome, here only in N.T. Clement 
of Alex. (Strom. V. 8. 49) uses it of the copy-head at the 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER | 105 


top of a child’s exercise book for the child to imitate, in- 
cluding all the letters of the alphabet. The papyri give 
many examples of Aupographé and hupographo in the sense 
of copying a letter. That ye should follow his steps (hina 
epakolouthéséte tois ichnesin autou). Purpose clause with 
hina and first aorist active subjunctive of epakolouthed, old 
verb, to follow closely upon, with the associative-instru- 
mental (I Tim. 5:10, 24) or the locative here. Jchnos is 
old word (from iké, to go), tracks, footprints, in N.T. only 
here, II Cor. 12:18; Rom. 4:12. Peter does not mean that 
Christ suffered only as an example (1:18), but he did leave 
us his example for our copying (I John 2:6). 

22. Who did no sin (hos hamartian ouk epoiésen). Quota- 
tion from Is. 53:9. He has already expressed the sinlessness 
of Christ in 1:19. The next clause is a combination of Is. 
3:9 and Zeph. 3:13. For “guile” (dolos) see verse 1. Was 
found (heurethé). First aorist passive indicative of heurisko. 
Christ’s guilelessness stood the test of scrutiny (Vincent), 
as Peter knew (Matt. 26:60; John 18:38; 19:4, 6). 

23. When he was reviled (loidoroumenos). Present passive 
participle of Joidored, old verb (from Joidoros, reviler, I Cor. 
§:11) as in John 9:28. Reviled not again (ouk anteloidoret). 
Imperfect active (for repeated incidents) of antiloidored, late 
and rare compound (Plutarch, Lucian, one papyrus example 
with compound following the simplex verb as here, Moulton 
and Milligan’s Vocabulary), here only in N.T. Idiomatic 
use of anti (in turn, return, back). Threatened not (ouk 
épeilei). Imperfect again (repeated acts) of apeiled, old 
compound (from apeilé, threat, Acts 9:1), in N.T. only here 
and Acts 4:17. But committed himself (paredidou de). Im- 
perfect active again (kept on committing himself) of para- 
didomi, to hand over, usually of one to a judge, but here 
not of another (as the Sanhedrin), but himself (supply 
heauton), for Jesus uses this very idea in Luke 23:46 as he 
dies. Jesus thus handed himself and his cause over to the 


1066 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Father who judges righteously (tai krinonti dikaios, dative 
of present active articular participle of krind). 

24. Who his own self (hos autos). Intensive pronoun with 
the relative referring to Christ (note relatives also in verses 
22 and 23). Bare our sins (anénegken tas hamartias hémon). 
Second aorist active indicative of anapherd, common verb 
of bringing sacrifice to the altar. Combination here of Is. 
53:12 and Deut. 21:23. Jesus is the perfect sin offering 
(Heb. 9:28). For Christ’s body (sdma) as the offering see 
I Cor. 11:24. ‘“‘Here St. Peter puts the Cross in the place 
of the altar” (Bigg). Upon the tree (epi to xulon). Not tree 
here as in Luke 23:31, originally just wood (I Cor. 3:12), 
then something made of wood, as a gibbet or cross. So 
used by Peter for the Cross in Acts 5:30; 10:39; and by 
Paul in Gal. 3:13 (quoting Deut. 21:23). Having died unto 
sins (tais hamartiais apogenomenoi). Second aorist middle 
participle of apoginomai, old compound to get away from, 
with dative (as here) to die to anything, here only in N.T. 
That we might live unto righteousness (hina téi dikaiosungi 
zésomen). Purpose clause with Aina and the first aorist ac- 
tive subjunctive of zad with the dative (cf. Rom. 6:20). 
Peter’s idea here is like that of Paul in Rom. 6:1-23, espe- 
cially verses 2, 10f.). By whose stripes ye were healed (hou 
tot molopi iathéte). From Is. 53:5. First aorist passive in- 
dicative of iaomai, common verb to heal (James 5:16) and 
the instrumental case of m@/éps, rare word (Aristotle, Plu- . 
tarch) for bruise or bloody wound, here only in N.T. Cf. 
1:18. Writing to slaves who may have received such stripes, 
Peter’s word is effective. 

25. For ye were going astray like sheep (ée gar hos probata 
planomenoi). Brought from Is. 53:6, but changed to peri- 
phrastic imperfect indicative with ée and present middle 
participle of planaéd, to wander away. Recall the words of 
Jesus in Luke 15:4-7. But are now returned (alla epestraph- 
éte). Second aorist passive indicative of epistrephd, old verb, 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 107 


to turn, to return (Matt. 10:13). Unto the Shepherd and 
Bishop of your souls (epi ton poimena kai episkopon ton 
psuchon humon). Jesus called himself the Good Shepherd 
(John to:11, and see also Heb. 13:20). Here alone is Christ 
called our “Bishop” (overseer). See both ideas combined 
in Ezek. 34:11. Philo calls God Episcopos. Jesus is also 
Apostolos Heb. 3:1) and he-deserves all other titles of dig- 
nity that we can give him. 


CHAPTER III 


1. In like manner (homoios). Adverb closely connected 
with hupotassomenoi, for which see 2:18. Ye wives (gunatkes). 
Without article. About wives see also Col. 3:18; Eph. 5:22; 
Titus 2:4. To your own husbands (tois idiois andrasin). 
Idiois occurs also in Ephesians and Titus, but not in Colos- 
sians. It strengthens the idea of possession in the article 
tois. Wives are not enjoined to be in subjection to the hus- 
bands of other women, as some think it fine to be (affinities!) 
Even if any obey not the word (kai ei tines apetthousin toi 
logoi). Condition of first class and dative case of Jogos (1:23, 
25; 2:8), that is, remain heathen. That they be gained (hina 
kerdéthésontai). Purpose clause with Aina and first future 
passive indicative of kerdaind, old verb, to gain (from kerdos, 
gain, interest) as in Matt. 18:15. See the future with Aina 
also in Luke 20:10; Rev. 3:9. Without the word (aneu logou). 
Probably here “word from their wives” (Hart), the other 
sense of Jogos (talk, not technical “‘word of God”). By 
the behaviour of their wives (dia tés ton gunaikon anastrophés). 
Won by pious living, not by nagging. Many a wife has had 
this blessed victory of grace. 

2. Beholding (epopteusantes). First aorist active participle — 
of epopteud, for which see 2:12. See 2:12 also for anastrophén 
(manner of life). Chaste (hagnén). Pure because ‘in fear” 
(en phobdi), no word in the Greek for “‘coupled,” fear of 
God, though in Eph. 5:33 fear (reverence for) of the husband 
is urged. 

3. Whose adorning (hon kosmos). Genitive plural of the 
relative referring to gunaikon (wives). Kosmos has here its 
old meaning of ornament (cf. our cosmetics), not the com- 


mon one of world (John 17:5) considered as an orderly 
108 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER | 10g 


whole. Mundus in Latin is used in this double sense (orna- 
ment, world). Let it de (estd). Imperative third singular of 
etmt. Not the outward adorning of plaiting the hair (ouch ho 
exdthen emplokes trichon). ‘The use of ouch here rather than 
mé (usual negative with the imperative) because of the sharp 
contrast in verse 4 (a//’). The old adverb exdthen (from 
without) is in the attributive position like an adjective. 
Emploké is a late word (from empleké, to inweave, II. Tim. 
2:4; II Pet. 2:20) in Strabo, but often in the papyri for 
struggle as well as plaiting, here only in N.T. Of wearing 
(peritheseos). Late and rare word (Galen, Arrian) from 
peritithemi (Matt. 27:28), to put around, a placing around. 
Ornaments of gold were worn round the hair as nets and | 
round the finger, arm, or ankle. Or of putting on (enduseds). 
Old word from endud (to put on), here only in N.T. Peter is 
not forbidding the wearing of clothes and ornaments by 
women, but the display of finery by contrast. Cf. I Tim. 
2:9-13 and Is. 3:16ff. 

4. But the hidden man of the heart (all’ho kruptos tés kardias 
anthropos). Here anthropos is in contrast with kosmos just 
before. See Paul’s use of anthropos for the outer and old, 
the inner and new man (II Cor. 4:16; Rom. 7:22; Col. 3:9; 
Eph. 3:16; 4:22, 24). See also the Jew en kruptoi (Rom. 
2:29) and what Jesus said about God seeing “‘in secret” 
(Matt. 6:4, 6). In the incorruptible apparel of a meek and 
quiet spirit (en tot aphthartoi tou hésuchiou kai praeos pneu- 
matos). No word in the Greek for ‘“‘apparel” (kosmdi). For 
aphthartos see 1:4, 23. For praus see Matt. 5:5; 11:29. 
Pneuma (spirit) is here disposition or temper (Bigg), unlike 
any other use in the N.T. In 3:18, 19; 4:6 it means the 
whole inner man as opposed to sarx or sdma, very much as 
psuché is used as opposed to sdma. Which (ho). Spirit just 
mentioned. Of great price (poluteles). Old word (from polu 
and fe/os, cost), in N.T. only here, Mark 14:3; I Tim. 2:9. 

5. Adorned themselves (ekosmoun heautas). Imperfect active 


110 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


of customary action, “‘used to adorn themselves.” Kosme6 is 
old verb from kosmos in the sense in verse 3. See Heb. 
11:11, 36 for like tribute to holy women of the O.T. The 
participle hupotassomenai repeats verse I. 

6. As Sarah (hos Sarra). Obeyed Abraham (hupékouen tot 
Abraam). Imperfect active of hupakoud, “used to obey” 
(with dative). Calling him lord (kurion auton kalousa). 
Present active participle of kaled. See Gen. 18:12. Whose 
children ye now are (hes egenéthete tekna). First aorist passive 
indicative of ginomai, “whose children ye became.” Tf ye do 
well (agathopoiousai). Present active feminine plural par- 
ticiple of agathopoied (2:15), “doing good.” And are not put 
in fear by any terror (kai mé phoboumenai médemian ptoésin). 
Free quotation from Prov. 3:25, “and not fearing any terror” 
(cognate accusative of pfoésis, after phoboumenai, present 
middle participle, late and rare word from p/oed, to terrify, as 
in Luke 21:9, here only in N.T.). Perhaps Peter regards 
Sarah’s falsehood as the yielding to a sudden terror (Hart). 
Hannah could also be named along with Sarah. The women 
somehow do not organize “daughters of Sarah” societies. 

4. Ye husbands likewise (hoi andres homoios). Probably 
“likewise” here refers to honouring all men (2:17), not “like- 
wise” of 3:1. Dwell with (sunoikountes). Present active par- 
ticiple of sunoiked, old verb for domestic association, here 
only in N.T. Used as imperative here like the participle in 
2:18; 3:1. According to knowledge (kata gnosin). ‘‘With.an 
intelligent recognition of the nature of the marriage relation” — 
(Vincent). Giving honour unto the woman as unto the weaker ves- 
sel (hos asthenester0i skeuei toi gunaikeioi aponemontes timén). 
Present active participle of aponemd, old verb, to assign, to 
portion out (or off), here only in N.T. Skeuos is an old 
and common word for vessel, furniture, utensil (Matt. 12:29; 
II Tim. 2:20). Here both husband and wife are termed 
vessels or ‘“‘parts of the furniture of God’s house”’ (Bigg). 
See Paul’s use of skeuos for ministers (II Cor. 4:7). Gunai- 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 111 


keidi here is an adjective (female, feminine) from guné 
(woman, wife). She is termed “‘the weaker” (sai astheneste- 
rot), not for intellectual or moral weakness, but purely for 
physical reasons, which the husband must recognize with 
due consideration for marital happiness. Yoint-heirs of the 
grace of life (sunkléronomoi charitos zo@s). Late double com- 
pound found in an Ephesian inscription and the papyri, in 
N.T. only here, Rom. 8:17; Eph. 3:6; Heb. 11:9. God’s 
gift of life eternal belongs to woman as well as to man. In 
the eyes of God the wife may be superior to the husband, not 
merely equal. To the end that your prayers be not hindered 
(cis to mé egkoptesthai tas proseuchas humon). Purpose clause 
with eis to and the present passive infinitive (with negative 
mé) of egkopto, to cut in, to interrupt, late verb (Polybius), as 
in Rom. 15:22, etc. Very vivid to us now with our tele- 
phones and radios when people cut in on us. Proseuchas 
(prayers) is the accusative of general reference. Husbands 
surely have here cause to consider why their prayers are not 
answered. 

8. Finally (to telos). Adverbial accusative. Conclusion, 
not of the Epistle, but only of the addresses to various 
classes. No verb (este imperative, be) here. Likeminded 
(homophrones). Old compound (homos, phrén), here only in 
N.T. Compassionate (sumpatheis). Old adjective (sun, 
pascho), in N.T. only here and Rom. 12:15. Our “‘sympa- 
thetic” in original sense. Loving as brethren (philadelphoi). 
Old compound (philos, adelphos), here only in N.T. Tender- 
hearted (eusplagchnoi). Late and rare compound (eu and 
splagchnon), in Hippocrates, Apocrypha, in N.T. only here 
and Eph. 4:32. Humble minded (tapeinophrones). Late com- 
pound (¢apeinos, phrén), in Plutarch, Prov. 29:23, here only 
in N.T. 

g. Not rendering evil for evil (mé apodidontes kakon anti 
kakou). Mé and the present active participle of apodidomi, 
to give back. The same phrase in Rom. 12:17 and the same 


112 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


idea in I Thess. 5:15. Peter may have obtained it from Paul 
or both from Prov. 17:13; 20:22, “‘an approximation to 
Christ’s repeal of the /ex talionis (Matt. §:38ff.) which Plato 
first opposed among the Greeks” (Hart). Common use of 
anti for exchange. Reviling for reviling (loidorian anti 
loidorias). Allusion to 2:23 (Christ’s own example). But 
contrariwise blessing (tounantion de eulogountes). Adverbial 
accusative and crasis (to enantion) of the neuter article and 
the adjective enantios (en, antios, opposite, Matt. 14:24), “on 
the contrary.” For eulogountes (present active participle of 
euloged) see Luke 6:28; Rom. 12:14 (imperative eulogeite). 
For hereunto were ye called (hoti eis touto eklethéte). See 2:21 
for this verb and use of eis touto (pointing to the preceding 
argument). That ye should inherit a blessing (hina eulogian 
kléronoméséte). Purpose clause with hina and the first aorist 
active subjunctive of k/éronomed, a plain reference to Esau, 
who wanted ‘“‘to inherit the blessing” (Heb. 12:17) after he 
had sold his birthright. Christians are the new Israel (both 
Gentiles and Jews) and are the spiritual descendants of 
Isaac (Gal. 4:22ff.). 

10. For (gar). Reason for the entire exhortation in verses 
8 and g and introducing in verses 10 to 12 a quotation from 
Ps. 34:13-17 with some slight changes. Would love life 
(thelon zoén agapain). ‘Wishing to love life.” This present 
life. The LXX expressions are obscure Hebraisms. The 
LXX has agapon (participle present active of agapad, not the - 
infinitive agapain. Let him refrain (pausato). Third person 
singular first aorist active imperative of paud to make stop, 
whereas the LXX has pauson (second person singular). 
His tongue (tén glossan). See James 3:1-12. That they 
speak no guile (tou mé lalésai dolon). Purpose clause with 
genitive article tou (negative mé) and the first aorist active 
infinitive of /aled. But it can also be explained as the 
ablative case with the redundant negative mé after a verb of 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 113 


hindering (pausaté) like Luke 4:42. See Robertson, Gram- 
mar,p.1061. “Let him refrain his lips from speaking guile.” 

11. Let him turn away (ekklinato). First aorist active im- 
perative third person singular of ekk/ind, where the LXX has 
ekklinon (second person singular). Old verb, in N.T. only 
here, Rom. 3:12; 16:17. Peter adapted the passage all 
through to his own construction and use. So as to poiésaté 
(let him do) for poiéson (do thou), zéésaté (let him seek) for 
zeteson (do thou seek), didxaté (let him pursue) for didxon (do 
thou pursue), all first aorist active imperatives (of poied, 
zéted, diok0). See Heb. 12:14 for “pursuing peace.” If men 
only did! 

12. Upon (epi). In the case of righteous (dikaious, in the — 
O.T. sense like dikaion Lot in II Pet. 2:7) for their good, but 
in the case of men “that do evil” (epi poiountas kaka, “upon 
men doing evil things”) “the face of the Lord” (prosdpon 
kuriou) is not for their good, epi here approaching “against” 
in idea. 

13. That will harm you (ho kakosin humas). Future active 
articular participle of kakod, old verb (from kakos, bad) as in 
Acts 7:6, 1g. Any real hurt, either that wishes to harm you 
or that can harm. See the words in Is. 50:9. If ye be (ean 
genésthe). Rather, “if ye become” (condition of third class 
with ean and second aorist middle subjunctive of ginomai). 
Zealous of that which is good (tou agathou zélotai). ‘Zealots 
for the good” (objective genitive after zé/dtai (zealots, not 
zealous), old word from zé/od (I Cor. 12:12). 

14. But and if ye should suffer (all’ ei kai paschoite). “But 
if ye should also (or even) suffer.” Condition of the fourth 
class with ei and the optative (undetermined with less likeli- 
hood), a rare condition in the vernacular Koiné, since the 
optative was a dying mode. If matters, in spite of the 
prophetic note of victory in verse 13, should come to actual 
suffering “‘for righteousness’ sake” (dia dikaiosunén) as in 
Matt. 5:10 (heneken, not dia), then “blessed” (makarioi, the 


114 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


very word of Jesus there which see, a word meaning “happy,” 
not eulogétoi) “are ye” (not in the Greek). If the con- 
clusion were expressed regularly, it would be eiéte an (ye 
would be), not este (ye are). It is interesting to note the 
third-class condition in verse 13 just before the fourth-class 
one in verse 14. Fear not their fear (ton phobon auton mé 
phobéthéte). Prohibition with mé and the first aorist (in- 
gressive) passive subjunctive of phobeomai, to fear, and the 
cognate accusative phobon (fear, terror). “Do not fear 
their threats” (Bigg). Quotation from Is. 8:12f. Neither be 
troubled (méde taraxthéte). Prohibition with méde and the 
first aorist (ingressive) subjunctive of ¢arassd, to disturb 
(Matt. 2:6; John 12:27). Part of the same quotation. 
Cf. 3:6. 

15. Sanctify (hagiasate). First aorist active imperative of 
hagiazd. This instead of being afraid. Christ as Lord 
(kurion ton Christon). Ton Christon, direct object with 
article and kurion predicate accusative (without article). 
This is the correct text, not ton theon of the Textus Receptus. 
An adaptation to Christ of Is. 8:13. Being ready always 
(hetoimoi aei). No participle in the Greek, old adjective 
(Tit. 3:1). To give answer (pros apologian). “‘For an apol- 
ogy,” the old sense of apologia, an answer back, a defence 
(not excuse), as in Acts 22:1, from apologeomai to defend 
(not to apologize). 4 reason concerning the hope that ts tn 
you (logon peri tés en humin elpidos). Original sense of logon 
(accusative of the thing with aitounti with humds, accusative © 
of the person) “concerning the in you hope.” Ready with 
a spoken defence of the inward hope. This attitude calls for 
an intelligent grasp of the hope and skill in presenting it. In 
Athens every citizen was expected to be able to join in the 
discussion of state affairs. Yet with meekness and fear (alla 
meta prautétos kai phobou). Of God (2:18; 3:2, 4), not of man. 

16. Having a good conscience (suneidésin echontes agathén). 
Present active participle of ech. See 2:18 for suneidésin 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 115 


and 3:21 for suneidésis agathé again (‘‘a quasi-personifica- 
tion,” Hart). That they may be put to shame (hina katai- 
schunthosin). Purpose clause with hina and the first aorist 
passive subjunctive of kataischund, old verb, to put to shame 
(Luke 13:17; I Pet. 2:6). Wherein ye are spoken against (en 
hoi katalaleisthe). Present passive indicative of katalaled, 
for which see 2:12 with en hoi also. Peter may be recalling 
(Hart) his own experience at Pentecost when the Jews first 
scoffed and others were cut to the heart (Acts 2:13, 37). 
Who revile (hoi epéreazontes). Articular present active par- 
ticiple of epéreazd, old verb (from epéreia, spiteful abuse), 
to insult, in N.T. only here and Luke 6:28. In Christ (en 
Christoi). Paul’s common mystical phrase that Peter has 
three times (here, 5:10, 14), not in John, though the idea is 
constantly in John. Peter here gives a new turn (cf. 2:12) 
to anastrophé (manner of life). “Constantly the apostle 
repeats his phrases with new significance and in a new light” 
(Bigg). 

17. Better (kreitton). Comparative of kratus as in II Pet. 
2:21; Heb. 1:4. Patient endurance not only silences cal- 
umny (verse 16), is Christlike (verse 18), but it has a value 
of its own (verse 17). Jf the will of God should so will (ei 
theloi to theléma tou theou). Condition of the fourth class 
again (ei—theloi) with ei and the optative. For a like 
pleonasm see John 7:17. For well-doing than for evtl-doing 
(agathopoiountas & kakopoiountas). Accusative plural agree- 
ing with Aumas understood (accusative of general reference 
with the infinitive paschein (to suffer) of the participles from 
agathopoied (see 2:15) and kakopoied (Mark 3:4, and see 
I Pet. 2:14 for kakopoios). 

18. Because Christ also died (hoti kai Christos apethanen). 
So the best MSS.; later ones epathen (suffered). The exam- 
ple of Christ should stir us to patient endurance. For sins 
(peri hamartion). “‘ Concerning sins” (not his, but ours, 
1:18). Peri (around, concerning) with hamartias in the 


116 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


regular phrase for the sin offering (Lev. 5:7; 6:30), though 
huper hamartias does occur (Ezek. 43:25). So in the N.T. 
we find both peri hamartion (Heb. 5:3) and huper hamartion 
(Heb. 5:1). Once (hapax). Once for all (Heb. 9:28), not 
once upon a time (pote). The righteous for the unrighteous 
(dikaios huper adikon). Literally, “just for unjust” (no 
articles). See I Pet. 2:19 for the sinlessness of Christ as 
the one perfect offering for sin. This is what gives Christ’s 
blood value. He has no sin himself. Some men today fail 
to perceive this point. That he might bring us to God (hina 
hémas prosagagéi toi thedi). Purpose clause with hina, with 
second aorist active subjunctive of prosagd and the dative 
case toi thedi. The MSS. vary between hémas (us) and 
humas (you). The verb prosagd means to lead or bring to 
(Matt. 18:24), to approach God (cf. prosagdgén in Eph. 
2:18), to present us to God on the basis of his atoning death 
for us, which has opened the way (Rom. 3:25; Heb. 10:1of.) 
Being put to death in the flesh (thanatotheis men sarki). First 
aorist passive participle of thanatod, old verb (from thanatos 
death), to put to death. Sarki is locative case of sarx. But 
quickened in the spirit (zdopoiétheis de pneumati). First aorist 
passive participle of zdopoied rare (Aristotle) verb (from 
z0opoios making alive), to make alive. The participles are 
not antecedent to apethanen, but simultaneous with it. There 
is no such construction as the participle of subsequent ac- 
tion. The spirit of Christ did not die when his flesh did, . 
but “was endued with new and greater powers of life” 
(Thayer). See I Cor. 15:22 for the use of the verb for the 
resurrection of the body. But the use of the word pneumati 
(locative case) in contrast with sarki starts Peter’s mind off 
in a long comparison by way of illustration that runs from 
verses Ig to 22. The following verses have caused more 
controversy than anything in the Epistle. 

19. In which also (en hoi kai). That is, in spirit (relative 
referring to pneumati. But, a number of modern scholars 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 117 


have followed Griesbach’s conjecture that the original text 
was either Nde kai (Noah also), or Endch kai (Enoch also), 
or en hoi kai Enoch (in which Enoch also) which an early 
scribe misunderstood or omitted Endch kai in copying (hom- 
oioteleuton). It is allowed in Stier and Theile’s Po/yglott. 
It is advocated by J. Cramer in 1891, by J. Rendel Harris 
in The Expositor (1901), and Sidelights on N.T. Research 
(p. 208), by Nestle in 1902, by Moffatt’s New Translation 
of the New Testament. Windisch rejects it as inconsistent 
with the context. There is no manuscript for the conjec- 
ture, though it would relieve the difficulty greatly. Luther 
admits that he does not know what Peter means. Bigg has 
no doubt that the event recorded took place between Christ’s 
death and his resurrection and holds that Peter is alluding 
to Christ’s Descensus ad Inferos in Acts 2:27 (with which 
he compares Matt. 27:52f.; Luke 23:34; Eph. 4:9). With 
this Windisch agrees. But Wohlenberg holds that Peter 
means that Christ in his preéxistent state preached to those 
who rejected the preaching of Noah who are now in prison. 
Augustine held that Christ was in Noah when he preached. 
Bigg argues strongly that Christ during the time between 
his death and resurrection preached to those who once heard 
Noah (but are now in prison) and offered them another 
chance and not mere condemnation. If so, why did Jesus 
confine his preaching to this one group? So the theories 
run on about this passage. One can only say that it is a 
slim hope for those who neglect or reject Christ in this life 
to gamble with a possible second chance after death which 
rests on very precarious exegesis of a most difficult passage 
in Peter’s Epistle. Accepting the text as we have, what can 
we make of it? He went and preached (poreutheis ekéruxen). 
First aorist passive (deponent) participle of poreuomai and 
first aorist active indicative of kérussd, the verb commonly 
used of the preaching of Jesus. Naturally the words mean 
personal action by Christ “in spirit” as illustration of his 


118 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


“quickening” (verse 18) whether done before his death or 
afterwards. It is interesting to observe that, just as the 
relative en hoi here tells something suggested by the word 
pneumati (in spirit) just before, so in verse 21 the relative 
ho (which) tells another illustration of the words di’ hudatos 
(by water) just before. Peter jumps from the flood in Noah’s 
time to baptism in Peter’s time, just as he jumped back- 
wards from Christ’s time to Noah’s time. He easily goes 
off at a word. What does he mean here by the story that 
illustrates Christ’s quickening in spirit? Unto the spirits in 
prison (tois en phulakéi pneumasin). The language is plain 
enough except that it does not make it clear whether Jesus 
did the preaching to spirits in prison at the time or to people 
whose spirits are now in prison, the point of doubt already 
discussed. The metaphorical use of en phulakéi can be illus- 
trated by II Pet. 2:4; Jude 6; Rev. 20:7 (the final abode of 
the lost). See Heb. 12:23 for the use of pueumata for dis- 
embodied spirits. 

20. Which aforetime were disobedient (apeithésasin pote). 
First aorist active participle of apeithed (for which verb see 
3:20) in the dative plural agreeing with pueumasin. These 
spirits now in prison once upon a time (pote) were disobe- 
dient (typical rebels, Hart calls them). Waited (apexede- 
cheto). Imperfect middle of the double compound apek- 
dechomai, late verb, probably first by Paul (I Cor. 1:7), 
though in the aprocryphal Acta Pauli (iii) and other late . 
writings cited by Nageli (p. 43). Perfective use of the two 
prepositions (apo, ek) to wait out to the end, as for Christ’s 
Second Coming (Phil. 3:20). A hundred years apparently 
after the warning (Gen. 5:32; 6:3; 7:6) Noah was prepar- 
ing the ark and Noah as a preacher of righteousness (II Pet. 
2:5) forewarned the people, who disregarded it. While the. 
ark was a preparing (kataskeuazomenés kibdtou). Genitive 
absolute with present passive participle of kataskeuazd, old 
compound (Matt. 11:10), for kibdtos (ark) see on Matt. 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 119 


24:38. Wherein (eis hén). “Into which” (the ark). That 
is (tout estin). Explanatory expression like our English 
idiom (Rom. 10:6, etc.). Souls (psuchai). Persons of both 
sexes (living men) as in Acts 2:41; 27:37, etc. Were saved 
(diesdthésan). First aorist passive indicative of dias6zd, old 
compound, to bring safe through as in Acts 27:44. Through 
water (di? hudatos). “By means of water” as the inter- 
mediate agent, an apparent change in the use of dia in 
composition just before (local use) to the instrumental use 
here. They came through the water in the ark and so were 
saved by the water in spite of the flood around them. Peter 
lays stress (Hart) on the water rather than on the ark (Heb. - 
11:7) for the sake of the following illustration. 

21. Which also (ho kai). Water just mentioned. After a 
true likeness (antitupon). Water in baptism now as an anti- 
type of Noah’s deliverance by water. For daptisma see on 
Matt. 3:7. For antitupon see on Heb. 9:24 (only other N.T. 
example) where the word is used of the earthly tabernacle 
corresponding (antitupa) to the heavenly, which is the pat- 
tern (tupon Heb. 8:5) for the earthly. So here baptism is 
presented as corresponding to (prefigured by) the deliver- 
ance of Noah’s family by water. It is only a vague parallel, 
but not over-fanciful. Doth now save you (humas nun s0zei). 
Simplex verb (s6z0, not the compound diasézd). The sav- 
ing by baptism which Peter here mentions is only symbolic 
(a metaphor or picture as in Rom. 6:2-6), not actual as 
Peter hastens to explain. Not the putting away of the filth 
of the flesh (ou sarkos apothesis rupou). Apothesis is old 
word from apotithemi (2:1), in N.T. only here and II Pet. 
1:14. Rupou (genitive of rupos) is old word (cf. ruparos, 
filthy, in James 2:2; Rev. 22:11), here only in N.T. (cf. Is. 
3:33 4:4). Baptism, Peter explains, does not wash away the 
filth of the flesh either in a literal sense, as a bath for the 
body, or in a metaphorical sense of the filth of the soul. 
No ceremonies really affect the conscience (Heb. 9:13f.). 


1200 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Peter here expressly denies baptismal remission of sin. But 
the interrogation of a good conscience toward God (alla sunei- 
déseds agathés eperotema eis theon). Old word from eperotad 
(to question as in Mark 9:32; Matt. 16:1), here only in 
N.T. In ancient Greek it never means answer, but only 
inquiry. The inscriptions of the age of the Antonines use 
it of the Senate’s approval after inquiry. That may be the 
sense here, that is, avowal of consecration to God after 
inquiry, having repented and turned to God and now making 
this public proclamation of that fact by means of baptism 
(the symbol of the previous inward change of heart). Thus 
taken, it matters little whether eis theon (toward God) be 
taken with eperdtéma or suneidéseds. Through the resurrec- 
tion of Fesus Christ (di? anastaseds Iésou Christou). For 
baptism is a symbolic picture of the resurrection of Christ 
as well as of our own spiritual renewal (Rom. 6:2-6). See 
1:3 for regeneration made possible by the resurrection of 
Jesus. 

22. Having gone (poreutheis). First aorist (deponent) par- 
ticiple (not periphrastic) of poreuomai. Being made subject 
(hupotagenton). Second aorist passive participle of hupo- 
tassO (see 2:18; 3:1) in the genitive absolute construction. 
Unto him (autoi). Christ. See I Cor. 15:28. 


CHAPTER IV 


1. For as much then as Christ suffered in the flesh (Christou 
oun pathontos sarki). Genitive absolute with second aorist 
active participle of paschd, to suffer, and the locative case 
of sarx (fresh). The oun (then, therefore) draws and applies 
the main lesson of 3:18-22, the fact that Christ suffered 
for us. drm ye yourselves also (kai humeis hoplisasthe). 
Direct middle first aorist imperative of hoplizd, old verb - 
from hoplon (weapon, John 18:3), in metaphorical sense, 
here only in N.T. With the same mind (ten auteén ennoian). 
Accusative of the thing (content), exnoian, old word (from 
en, nous), putting in mind, thinking, will, in N.T. only here 
and Heb. 4:12. “Here again Christus Patiens is our hupo- 
grammos” (Bigg). For (hoti). Reason for the exhortation. 
Hath ceased from sin (pepautai hamartias). Perfect middle 
indicative of paud to make cease and the ablative singular 
hamartias, but B reads the dative plural hamartiais (cf. 
Rom. 6:1f.). Temptation has lost its appeal and power 
with such a man. 

2. That ye no longer should live (eis to méketi bidsai). Pur- 
pose clause with es fo (negative mé) and the first aorist (for 
the Attic second aorist Jidnai) active infinitive of Ji00, old 
verb, to spend a life (from dios, course of life, Luke 8:14), 
here only in N.T. The rest of your time in the flesh (ton 
epiloipon en sarki chronon). Accusative of time (chronon, 
period of time). Epiloipon is old adjective (epi, loipos, re- 
maining in addition), here only in N.T. But eis to here can 
be result (so that) as in Rom. 1:20; 4:18. 

3. Past (pareléluthos). Perfect active participle of the 
compound verb parerchomai, old verb, to go by (beside) as in 
Matt. 14:15 with ora (hour). May suffice (arketos). No 


121 


122 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


copula in the Greek, probably estin (is) rather than dunatai 
(can). Late and rare verbal adjective from arked, to suffice, 
in the papyri several times, in N.T. only here and Matt. 
6:34; 10:25, apparently referring to Christ’s words in Matt. 
6:34 (possibly an axiom or proverb). To have wrought 
(kateirgasthai). Perfect middle infinitive of katergazomai, 
common compound (kata, ergon work) asin I Cor. 5:3. The 
desire (to bouléma). Correct text, not theléma. Either 
means the thing desired, willed. Jews sometimes fell 
in with the ways of Gentiles (Rom. 2:21-24; 3:9-18; 
Eph. 2:1-3) as today some Christians copy the ways of the 
world. And to have walked (peporeumenous). Perfect mid- 
dle participle of poreuomai in the accusative plural of general 
reference with the infinitive kateirgasthai. Literally, ‘“‘hav- 
ing walked or gone.” In lasciviousness (en aselgeiais). All 
these sins are in the locative case with en. ‘“‘In unbridled 
lustful excesses” (II Pet. 2:7; II Cor. 12:21). Lusts (epithu- 
miais). Cf. 2:11; 4:2. Winebibbings (oinophlugiais). Old 
compound (010s, wine, phlud, to bubble up), for drunken- 
ness, here only in N.T. (also in Deut. 21:20). Revellings 
(komois). Old word (from keimai, to lie down), rioting 
drinking parties, in N.T. here and Gal. 5:21; Rom. 13:13. 
Carousings (potois). Old word for drinking carousal (from 
pind, to drink), here only in the N.T. In the light of these 
words it seems strange to find modern Christians justifying 
their “personal liberty” to drink and carouse, to say nothing | 
of the prohibition law. The Greeks actually carried lust and 
drunkenness into their religious observances (Aphrodite, for 
instance). Abominable idolatries (athemitois eiddlolatriais). 
To the Christian all “idolatry,” (eidolon, latreia), worship of 
idols, is “abominable,” not allowed (alpha privative and 
themitos, themistos the old form, verbal of themizd, to make 
lawful), but particularly those associated with drinking and 
licentiousness. The only other N.T. example of athemitos is 
by Peter also (Acts 10:28) and about the Mosaic law. That 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 123 


may be the idea here, for Jews often fell into idolatrous prac- 
tices (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p- 274). 

4. Wherein (en hoi). “In which thing” (manner of life). 
They think it strange (xenizontai). Present passive indicative 
of xenizd, old verb (from xenos, stranger), to entertain a 
guest (Acts 10:23), to’ astonish (Acts 17:20). See also 4:12. 
“They are surprised or astonished.” That ye run not with 
them (mé suntrechonton humon). Genitive absolute (nega- 
tive mé) with present active participle of suntrechd, old com- 
pound, to run together like a crowd or a mob as here (just 
like our phrase, “running with certain folks”). Into the 
same excess of riot (eis tén autén tés asodtias anachusin). — 
Anachusin (from anached to pour forth) is a late and rare 
word, our overflowing, here only in N.T. Asdtias is the 
character of an abandoned man (asétos, cf. asotds in Luke 
15:13), old word for a dissolute life, in N.T. only here, 
Eph. 5:18; Titus 1:6. Speaking evil of you (blasphémountes). 
Present active participle of dlasphémed as in Luke 22:65. 
“The Christians were compelled to stand aloof from all the 
social pleasures of the world, and the Gentiles bitterly 
resented their puritanism, regarding them as the enemies of 
all joy, and therefore of the human race”’ (Bigg). 

5. Who shall give account (hoi apodosousin logon). Future 
active indicative of apodidimi. For this use with logon 
(account) see Matt. 12:36; Luke 16:2; Acts 19:40; Heb. 
13:17. For the sudden use of the relative hoi see Rom. 3:8. 
To him that is ready to judge (toi hetoimés krinonti). Dative, 
“to the one readily judging,” correct text, not hetoimds 
echonti krinai, “‘to the one ready to judge,” which “‘softens 
the rugged original” (Hart). That is Christ apparently 
(1:13; II Cor. 5:10), but the Father in 1:17. The quick and 
the dead (zontas kai nekrous). “Living and dead.” Those 
living at the time and those already dead (I Thess. 4:15). 

6. Was the gospel preached (euéggelisthé). First aorist 
passive indicative of euaggelizo. Impersonal use. Even to 


124 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


the dead (kai nekrois). Does Peter here mean preached to 
men after they are dead or to men once alive but dead now or 
when the judgment comes? There are those (Augustine, 
Luther, etc.) who take “dead” here in the spiritual sense 
(dead in trespasses and sins as in Col. 2:13; Eph. 2:1), but 
consider it “‘impossible” for Peter to use the same word in 
two senses so close together; but Jesus did it in the same 
sentence, as in the case of psuché (life) in Matt. 16:25. Bigg 
takes it to mean that all men who did not hear the gospel 
message in this life will hear it in the next before the final 
judgment. That they might be judged (hina krithosin men). 
Purpose clause with Aina and the first aorist passive sub- 
junctive of krind, to judge, whereas zdsin de (by contrast) is 
the present active subjunctive of 2ad, to live. There is con- 
trast also between kata anthropous (according to men) and 
kata theon (according to God). 

7. But the end of all things is at hand (panton de to telos 
éggiken). Perfect active indicative of eggiz0, to draw near, 
common late verb (from eggus), same form used by the 
Baptist of the Messiah’s arrival (Matt. 3:2) and by James 
in 5:8 (of the second coming). How near Peter does not say, 
but he urges readiness (1:5f.; 4:6) as Jesus did (Mark 14:38) 
and Paul (I Thess. 5:6), though it is drawing nearer all the 
time (Rom. 12:11), but not at once (II Thess. 2:2). Be 
ye therefore of sound mind (sophronésate oun). In view of 
the coming of Christ. First aorist (ingressive) active im- 
perative of sdphroned (sds, sound, phrén, mind) as in Mark 
5:15. Be sober unto prayer (népsate eis proseuchas). First 
aorist (ingressive of néphd (see 1:13) and plural proseuchas, 
(prayers). Cf. Eph. 6:18. 

8. Above all things (pro panton). See this phrase in James 
5:12. Being fervent (ektené echontes). Present active -par- 
ticiple of echontes and predicate accusative of adjective 
ektenés (from ekteind, to stretch out), stretched out, here 
only in N.T., “holding intent you love among yourselves.” 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 125 


For love covereth a multitude of sins (hoti agapé kaluptei plethos 
hamartion). See James 5:20 for meaning, sins of the one 
loved, not of the one loving. 

9. Using hospitality (philoxenoi). ‘Friendly to strangers,” 
old word (from philos, xenos), in N.T. only here and I Tim. 
3:2; Titus 1:8. No-verb here in the Greek. Without mur- 
muring (aneu goggusmou). Like choris goggusmon in Phil. 
2:14. Complaint spoils hospitality. Jesus enjoined the 
entertainment of strangers (Matt. 25:35). Inns were rare 
and very poor. Hospitality made mission work possible 
(III John 5). . 

10. Gift (charisma). Late N.T. word (in late papyri) from 
charizomai, to give graciously. It is used here by Peter as 
one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit (I Cor. 12:4, 9, 29-31; Rom. 
12:6). Ministering (diakonountes). Present active par- 
ticiple plural of diakoned, common verb (Matt. 20:28), 
though hekastos (each) is singular. As good stewards (his 
kaloi oikonomoi). For “‘steward” (oitkonomos, house-man- 
ager) see Luke 16:1 and I Cor. 4:1 (used by Paul of himself) 
and of any bishop (Titus 1:7), but here of any Christian. 
See kalos used with diakonos in I Tim. 4:6. Of the manifold 
grace of God (poikilés charitos theou). For poikilos (many- 
colored) see on 1:6 and James 1:2. 

11. If any man speaketh (ei tis lalei). Condition of first 
class, assumed. as a fact. Speaking as it were oracles of God 
(hos logia theou). No predicate in this conclusion of the 
condition. For /ogia theou see Acts 7:38 (Mosaic law); 
Rom. 3:2 (the Old Testament); Heb. 5:12 (the substance of 
Christian teaching), here of the utterances of God through 
Christian teachers. Logion (old word) is a diminutive of 
logos (speech, word). It can be construed here as nomina- 
tive or as accusative. The verb has to be supplied. Jf any 
one ministereth (ei tis diakonei). First-class condition again. 
See Acts 6:2-4 for the twofold division of service involved 
here. Which God supplieth (hes choregei ho theos). Ablative 


1246 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


case (Aés) of the relative attracted from the accusative hén, 
object of chorégei (present active indicative of choréged, old 
verb, to supply from chorégos, chorus leader, in N.T. only 
here and II Cor. 9:10). Peter has the compound epichorégeo 
in II Pet. 1:5, 11. God is the supplier of strength. That 
God may be glorified (hina doxazétai ho theos). Purpose 
clause with hina and the present passive subjunctive of 
doxazd. See John 15:8. Whose is (hoi estin). “To whom 
(dative) is,” that is to Jesus Christ the immediate ante- 
cedent, but in Rom. 16:27 and Jude 25 the doxology is to 
God through Christ. For other doxologies see I Pet. 5:11; 
II Pet. 3:18; Gal. 1:5; Rom. 9:5; 11:36; Phil. 4:20; Eph. 3:21; 
LTimiia:ty 96216; Tim) 4S pdlebwag215 Revieasepipsiigs 
7:12, The others addressed to Christ are II Pet. 3:18; 
II Tim. 4:18; Rev. 1:6. 

12. Think it not strange (mé xenizesthe). Prohibition with 
mé and the present passive imperative of xenizd, for which 
verb see 4:4. “Be not amazed.” Concerning the fiery trial 
among you (tei en humin purosei). Instrumental case, “by 
the among you burning,” metaphorical sense of old word 
(since Aristotle), from purod, to burn (pur fire). See 1:7 for 
the metaphor. See Rev. 18:9, 18 only other N.T. examples. 
It occurs in Prov. 27:21 for the smelting of gold and silver 
and so in Ps. 56:10 (LXX 65:10): ‘‘Thou didst smelt us as 
silver is smelted” (epurdsas hémas hos puroutai to argurion). 
Which cometh upon you (humin ginomenéi). Present middle 
participle of ginomai (already coming) with dative case © 
humin. To prove you (pros peirasmon). ‘‘For testing.” As 
though a strange thing happened unto you (hos xenou humin 
sumbainontos). Genitive absolute with Ads, giving the al- 
leged reason, and humin, dative case with sumbainontos 
(present active participle of sumbaind, to go together, to 
happen (Mark 10:32), agreeing with xezou (strange, Heb. 
13:9). 

13. Inasmuch (katho). “In so far forth as” (‘‘according 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 127 


to which thing”), old conjunction, in N.T. only here and 
II Cor. 8:12; Rom. 8:26. Ye are partakers of (koinéneite). 
Present active indicative of koindned, old verb (from koind- 
nos, partner), to share in either with genitive (Heb. 2:14) 
or dative as here (pathémasin). That ye may rejoice with 
exceeding joy (hina charéte agallidmenoi). Purpose clause 
with hina and second aorist passive subjunctive of chaird, 
with the present middle participle of agalliaéd to exult (1:8), 
“that ye may rejoice exulting.” See 1:6 to 8 for this same 
idea associated with the second coming of Christ as here. 
14. If ye are reproached (ei oneidizesthe). Condition of 
first class assumed as true with ef and present passive indica- 
tive of oneidizd, for which verb see James 1:5. For the name 
of Christ (en onomati Christou). ‘‘In the matter of the name 
of Christ.” For the idea see Matt. 5:11f.; 19:29; Acts 5:41; 
9:16; 21:13. This is the only N.T. example of just onoma 
Christou, here used because of the use of Christianos in 
verse 16. For the beatitude makarioi see Matt. 5:11f. The 
Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God (to tes doxés kai to tou 
theou pneuma). Note repetition of the article (to) though 
pneuma only once. The reference is to the Holy Spirit, who 
is the Spirit of Glory and of God. Resteth upon you (eph’ 
hémas anapauetai). Quotation from Is. 11:2. Present 
middle indicative of anapaud, to give rest, refresh (Matt. 
11:28). “He rests upon the Christian as the Shechinah 
rested upon the tabernacle” (Bigg). Cf. 1:8; Matt. 3:16. 
15. Let no one of you suffer (mé tis humon pascheto). Pro- 
hibition with mé and present active imperative (habit pro- 
hibited). 4s (Ads). Charged as and being so. Two specific 
crimes (murderer, thief) and one general phrase (kakopoios, 
evildoer, I Pet. 2:12, 14), and one unusual term allotriepts- 
copos (a meddler in other men’s matters). Note @ Ads (or as) 
=or “also only as” (Wohlenberg). The word was appar- 
ently coined by Peter (occurring elsewhere only in Dionys. 
Areop. and late eccles. writers) from adlotrios (belonging to 


128 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


another, II Cor. 10:15) and episkopos, overseer, inspector, 
I Pet. 2:25). The idea is apparently one who spies out the 
affairs of other men. Deissmann (Bible Studies, p. 224) gives 
a second-century papyrus with allotrion epithumétés a specu- 
lator alienorum. Epictetus has a like idea (iii. 22.97). Biggs 
takes it to refer to “‘things forbidden.” Clement of Alex- 
andria tells of a disciple of the Apostle John who became a 
bandit chief. Ramsay (Church in the Roman Empire, pp. 
293, 348) thinks the word refers to breaking up family rela- 
tionships. Hart refers us to the gadders-about in I Thess. 
4:11; II Thess. 3:11 and women as gossipers in I Thess. 5:13. 
It is interesting to note also that episkopos here is the word 
for “‘bishop” and so suggests also preachers meddling in the 
work of other preachers. 

16. But if as a Christian (ei de hos Christianos). Supply 
the verb paschei (condition of first class, “if one suffer as a 
Christian”). This word occurs only three times in the N.T. 
(Acts 11:26; 26:28; I Pet. 4:16). It is word of Latin forma- 
tion coined to distinguish followers of Christ from Jews and 
Gentiles (Acts 11:26). Each instance bears that idea. It is 
not the usual term at first like mathétai (disciples), saints 
(hagioi), believers (pisteuontes), etc. The Jews used Nazo- 
raioi (Nazarenes) as a nickname for Christians (Acts 24:5). 
By a.p. 64 the name Christian was in common use in Rome 
(Tacitus, dun. XV. 44). Owing to itacism it was sometimes 
spelled Chréstianoi (i, ei and @ pronounced alike). Let him 
not be ashamed (mé aischunesthd). Prohibition with mé and © 
present passive imperative of aischund. Peter had once been 
ashamed to suffer reproach or even a sneer for being a dis- 
ciple of Christ (Mark 14:68). See the words of Jesus in 
Mark 8:38 and Paul’s in II Tim. 1:12. Peter is not ashamed 
now. In this name (en toi onomati toutoi). Of Christian as 
in Mark 9:41, “because ye are Christ’s.” 

17. For the time is come (hoti ho kairos). No predicate, 
probably estin (is) to be supplied. The phrase that follows 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 129 


comes from the vision of Ezekiel (chapter 9). The construc- 
tion is unusual with fou arxasthai (genitive articular aorist 
middle infinitive of archd), not exactly purpose or result, and 
almost in apposition (epexegetic), but note fou elthein used 
as subject in Luke 17:1. The persecution on hand (1:7) was 
a foretaste of more to come. By “house of God” he can 
mean the same. as the “spiritual house” of 2:5 or a local 
church. Biggs even takes it to refer to the family. And if 
it begin first at us (ei de proton aphhémon). Condition of 
first class again, with the verb archetai understood. “From 
us” (aph’hémon) more exactly. End (telos). Final fate. Of 
them that obey not the gospel of God (ton apeithounton toi tou 
theou euaggelidi). ‘“Of those disobeying the gospel of God.’” 
See the same idea in Rom. 2:8. See Mark 1:14 for believing 
in the gospel. 

18. And if the righteous is scarcely saved (kai ei ho dikaios 
molis sozetat). First-class condition again with e7 and present 
passive indicative of s0z0. Quotation from Prov. 11:31. See 
3:12, 14 and Matt. 5:20. But the Christian is not saved by 
his own righteousness (Phil. 3:9; Rev. 7:14). For molis see 
Acts 14:18 and for asebés (ungodly, without reverence) see 
Rom. 4:5; II Pet. 2:5. Will appear (phaneitai). Future 
middle of phaind, to show. For the question see Mark 
10:24-26. 

19. Wherefore (hoste). Picking up the thread of consola- 
tion again (Bigg). Commit their souls (paratithesthosan tas 
psuchas). Present (continuous) middle imperative third 
plural of paratithémi, old word, a banking figure, to deposit, 
as in I. Tim. 1:18; II Tim. 2:2, the word used by Jesus as 
he died (Luke 23:46). In well-doing (en agathopoiiai). Late 
and rare word, only here in N.T., from agathopoied (I Pet. 
Ding P20)é 


CHAPTER V 


1. Who am a fellow-elder (ho sunpresbuteros). Earliest use 
of this compound in an inscription of B.c. 120 for fellow- 
elders (alderman) in a town, here only in N.T.,-in eccles. 
writers. For the word presbuteros in the technical sense of 
officers in a Christian church (like elder in the local syna- 
gogues of the Jews) see Acts 11:30; 20:17. It is noteworthy 
that here Peter the Apostle (1:1) calls himself an elder along 
with (sum) the other “elders.” 4 witness (martus). This is 
what Jesus had said they must be (Acts 1:8) and what Peter 
claimed to be (Acts 3:15; 10:39). So Paul was to be a 
martus (Acts 22:15). Who am also a partaker (ho kai koino- 
nos). ‘“The partner also,” “the partaker also.” See Luke 
5:10; II Cor. 1:7; II Pet. 1:4. See same idea in Rom. 8:17. 
In Gal. 3:23 and Rom. 8:18 we have almost this about the 
glory about to be revealed to us where mellé as here is used 
with the infinitive. 

2. Tend (poimanate). First aorist active imperative of 
poimaind, old verb, from poimén (shepherd) as in Luke 17:7. 
Jesus used this very word to Peter in the interview by the 
Sea of Galilee (John 21:16) and Peter doubtless has this fact 
in mind here. Paul used the word to the elders at Miletus 
(Acts 20:28). See 2:25 for the metaphor. Flock (poimnion). 
Old word, likewise from poimén, contraction of poimenion 
(Luke 12:32). Exercising the oversight (episkopountes). Pres- 
ent active participle of episkoped, old word (in Heb. 12:15 
alone in N.T.), omitted here by Aleph B. Not by constraint 
(mé anagkastos). Negative mé because of the imperative. 
Old adverb from verbal adjective anagkastos, here alone in 
N.T. But willingly (alla hekousios). By contrast. Old ad- 
verb, in N.T. only here and Heb. 10:26. Nor yet for filthy 


130 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 131 


lucre (méde aischrokerdds). A compound adverb not found 
elsewhere, but the old adjective aischrokerdés is in I Tim. 
3:8; Titus 1:7. See also Titus 1:11 “for the sake of filthy 
lucre” (aischrou kerdous charin). Clearly the elders received 
stipends, else there could be no such temptation. But of a 
ready mind (alla prothumos). Old adverb from prothumos 
(Matt. 26:41), here only in N.T. 

3- Lording it over (katakurieuontes). Present active par- 
ticiple of katakurieud, late compound (kata, kurios) as in 
Matt. 20:25. The charge allotted to you (ton kléron). ‘‘The 
charges,” “the lots” or “the allotments.” See it in Acts 
1:17, 25 in this sense. The old word meant a die (Matt. 
27:25), a portion (Col. 1:12; I Pet. 1:4), here the charges © 
assigned (cf. Acts 17:4). From the adjective k/érikos come 
our cleric, clerical, clerk. Wycliff translated it here “neither 
as having lordship in the clergie.” Making yourselves en- 
samples (tupoi ginomenoi). Present active participle of gino- 
mai and predicate nominative tupoi (types, models) for 
which phrase see I Thess. 1:7. Continually becoming. See 
2:21 for hupogrammos (writing-copy). To the flock (tou poi- 
mniou). Objective genitive. 

4. When the chief Shepherd shall be manifested (phanero- 
thentos tou archipoimenos). Genitive absolute with first 
aorist passive participle of phanerod, to manifest, and geni- 
tive of archipoimén, a compound (archi, poimén) after anal- 
ogy of archiereus, here only in N.T., but in Testam. of Twelve 
Patrs. (Jud. #8) and on a piece of wood around an Egyptian 
mummy and also on a papyrus A.D. 338 (Deissmann, Light, 
etc., p. 100). See Heb. 13:20 for ho poiméen ho megas (the 
Shepherd the great). Ye shall receive (komieisthe). Future 
of komizo (1:9, which see). The crown of glory that fadeth 
not away (ton amarantinon tés doxés stephanon). For “‘crown”’ 
(stephanos) see James 1:12; I Cor. 9:25; Il Tim. 4:8; Rev. 
2:10; 3:10; 4:4. In the Gospels it is used only of the crown 
of thorns, but Jesus is crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 


132 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


2:9). In all these passages it is the crown of victory as it is 
here. See 1:4 for amarantos, unfading. Amarantinos is made 
from that word as the name of a flower amaranth (so called 
because it never withers and revives if moistened with water 
and so used as a symbol of immortality), “composed of ama- 
ranth” or “‘amarantine,” ‘“‘the amarantine (unfading) crown 
of glory.” 

5. Be subject (hopotagéte). Second aorist passive impera- 
tive of hupotasso. Unto the elder (presbuterois). Dative case. 
Here the antithesis between younger and elder shows that 
the word refers to age, not to office as in 5:1. See a like 
change in meaning in I Tim. 5:1,17. // (pantes). All ages, 
sexes, classes. Gird yourselves with humility (tén tapeino- 
phrosunén egkombosasthe). First aorist middle imperative 
of egkomboomai, \ate and rare verb (in Apollodorus, fourth 
cent. B.c.), here only in N.T., from en and koméos (knot, like 
the knot of a girdle). Egkomboma was the white scarf or 
apron of slaves. It is quite probable that Peter here is 
thinking of what Jesus did (John 13:4ff.) when he girded 
himself with a towel and taught the disciples, Peter in par- 
ticular (John 13:9ff.), the lesson of humility (John 13:15). 
Peter had at last learned the lesson (John 21:15-19). The 
proud (huperéphanois). Dative plural of huperéphanos (James 
4:6; Rom. 1:30) after antitassetai (present middle indicative 
of antitasso as in James 4:6 (quoted there as here from Prov. 


6. Humble yourselves therefore (tapeinothéte oun). First © 
aorist passive imperative of tapeinod, old verb, for which 
see Matt. 18:4. Peter is here in the réle of a preacher of 
humility. ‘Be humbled.” Under the mighty hand of God 
(hupo tén krataian cheira tou theou). Common O.T. picture 
(Ex. 3:19; 20:33, etc.). That he may exalt you (hina hupsosé). 
Purpose clause with Aina and first aorist active subjunctive 
of hupsod. Cf. Luke 14:11; Phil. 2:9. In due time (en kairéi). 
Same phrase in Matt. 24:45. 


FIRST EPISTLE GENERAL OF PETER 133 


7. Casting (epiripsantes). First aorist active participle of 
epiripto, old verb, to throw upon, in N.T. only here and 
Luke 19:35 (casting their clothes on the colt), here from 
Ps. 54 (55):23. For merimna see Matt. 6:25, 31, 34. He 
careth (autoi melei). Impersonal verb melei (present active 
indicative) with dative aufdi, ‘“‘it is a care to him.” God 
does care (Luke 21:18). 

8. Be watchful (grégorésate). First aorist active impera- 
tive of grégored, late present imperative from perfect egrégora 
(to be awake) from egeird (to arouse), as in Matt. 24:42. 
For népsate see 1:13; 4:7. Your adversary (ho antidikos 
humon). Old word for opponent in a lawsuit (Matt. 5:25). 
The devil (diabolos). Slanderer. See on Matt. 4:1. As ao 
roaring lion (hos Oruomenos leon). But Jesus is also pictured 
as the Lion of the tribe of Judah (Rev. 5:5). But Satan 
roars at the saints. Present middle participle druomai, old 
verb, here only in N.T., to howl like a wolf, dog, or lion, of 
men to sing loud (Pindar). See Ps. 21 (22):14. Whom he 
may devour (katapiein). Second aorist active infinitive of 
katapind, to drink down. B does not have ¢ina, Aleph has 
tina (somebody), “‘to devour some one,” while A has inter- 
rogative tina, “whom he may devour” (very rare idiom). 
But the devil’s purpose is the ruin of men. He is a “‘peri- 
patetic” (peripatei) like the peripatetic philosophers who 
walked as they talked. Satan wants all of us and sifts us 
all (Luke 22:31). 

9. Whom withstand (hoi antistéte). Imperative second 
aorist active (intransitive) of anthistémi; same form in James 
4:7, which see. Dative case of relative (A0i). For the im- 
perative in a subordinate clause see verse 12, II Thess. 3:10; 
II Tim. 4:15; Heb. 13:7. Cowardice never wins against the 
devil (II Tim. 1:7), but only courage. Steadfast in your faith 
(stereoi t@i pistei). Locative case pistei. Stereos is old ad- 
jective for solid like a foundacion (II Tim. 2:19). The same 
sufferings (ta auta ton pathématon). An unusual construc-

tion with the genitive rather than the usual ta auta pathé- 
mata, perhaps as Hofmann suggests, ‘‘the same tax of suffer- 
ings” (“the same things in sufferings”). Probably this is 
correct and is like Xenophon’s phrase in the Memorabilia 
(IV. 8. 8), ta tou géeros epiteleisthai (to pay the tax of old 
age). re accomplished (epiteleisthai). Present (and so 
process) middle (you are paying) or passive (is paid) infini- 
tive of epiteled, old verb, to accomplish (II Cor. 7:1). In 
your brethren who are in the world (tei en toi kosmoi humon 
adelphotéti). Associate-instrumental case adelphotéti (in N.T. 
only here and 2:17, which see) after ta auta (like I Cor. 11:5) 
or dative after epiteleisthai. Even so eidotes (second perfect 
active participle of oidz) with an infinitive usually means 
“knowing how to” (object infinitive) as in Luke 12:56; Phil. 
3:18 rather than “knowing that” (indirect assertion) as 
taken above. 

10. The God of all grace (ho theos tés charitos). See 4:10 
for poikilés charitos theou (of the variegated grace of God). 
In Christ (en Christoi). A Pauline phrase (II Cor. 5:17-19), 
but Petrine also. For God’s “‘calling” us (kalesas) see I 
Thess. 5:23f.; I Cor. 1:8f.; Rom. 8:29f. After that ye have 
suffered a little while (oligon pathontas). Second aorist active 
participle of paschd, antecedent to the principal verbs which 
are future active (katartisei, to mend, Mark 1:19; Gal. 6:1, 
sterixei, for which see Luke 9:51 and 22:32, sthendsei from 
sthenos and so far a hapax legomenon like enischud according - 
to Hesychius). For oligon see 1:6. 

11. To him (autoi). To God (dative case). Note kratos 
in the doxology as in I Tim. 6:16 and briefer than the 
doxology in I Pet. 4:11, to Christ. 

12. By Silvanus (dia Silouanou). Probably this post- 
script (12 to 14) is in Peter’s own handwriting, as Paul did 
(II Thess. 3:17f.; Gal. 6:11-18). If so, Silvanus (Silas) 
was the amanuensis and the bearer of the Epistle. 4s J

account him (hos logizomai). Peter uses Paul’s phrase (I 
Cor. 4:1; Rom. 8:18) in giving approval to Paul’s former 
companion (Acts 15:40). J have written (egrapsa). Epis- 
tolary aorist applying to this Epistle as in I Cor. 5:11 (not 
5:9); 9:15; Gal. 6:11; Rom. 15:15; Philemon 19, 21. Briefly 
(di’ oligon). ‘‘By few words,” as Peter looked at it, cer- 
tainly not a long letter in fact. Cf. Heb. 13:22. Testifying 
(epimarturon). Present active participle of epimartured, to 
bear witness to, old compound, here alone in N.T., though 
the double compound sunepimartured in Heb. 2:4. That this 
is the true grace of God (tautén einai aléthé charin tou theou). 
Infinitive einai in indirect assertion and accusative of gen- 
eral reference (tautén) and predicate accusative charin. Peter — 
includes the whole of the Epistle by God’s grace (1:10) and 
obedience to the truth (John 1:17; Gal. 2:5; Col. 1:6). 
Stand ye fast therein (eis hén stéte). “In which (grace) take 
your stand” (ingressive aorist active imperative of histemi). 

13. She that is in Babylon, elect together with you (hé en 
Babuloni suneklekté). Either actual Babylon or, as most 
likely, mystical Babylon (Rome) as in the Apocalypse. If 
Peter is in Rome about a.p. 65, there is every reason why 
he should not make that fact plain to the world at large 
and least of all to Nero. It is also uncertain whether é 
suneklekté (found here alone), “the co-elect woman,” means 
Peter’s wife (I Cor. 9:5) or the church in “Babylon.” The 
natural way to take it is for Peter’s wife. Cf. eklektét 
kuriai in II John 1 (also verse 13). Mark my son (Markos 
ho huios mou). So this fact agrees with the numerous state- 
ments by the early Christian writers that Mark, after leav- 
ing Barnabas, became Peter’s “interpreter” and under his 
influence wrote his Gospel. We know that Mark was with 
Paul in Rome some years before this time (Col. 4:10). 

14. With a kiss of love (en philémat: agapés). As in I Cor. 
16:20. The abuse of this custom led to its confinement to 


136 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


men with men and women with women and to its final 
abandonment (Apost. Const. ii. 57, 12). That are in Christ 
(tois en Christoi). This is the greatest of all secret orders 
and ties, one that is open to all who take Christ as Lord and 
Saviour.

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


Most Dovustrut New TestaMent Book 


Every book in the New Testament is challenged by some 
one, as indeed the historicity of Jesus Christ himself is and 
the very existence of God. But it is true that more modern 
scholars deny the genuineness of II Peter than that of any 
single book in the canon. This is done by men like F. H. 
Chase, J. B. Mayor, and R. D. Strachan, who are followers - 
of Christ as Lord and Saviour. One has to admit that the 
case concerning II Peter has problems of peculiar difficulty 
that call for careful consideration and balanced judgment. 
One other word needs to be said, which is that an adverse 
decision against the authenticity of II Peter stands by itself 
and does not affect the genuineness of the other books. It 
is easy to take an extreme position for or against it without 
full knowledge of all the evidence. 


Stow 1n GENERAL ACCEPTANCE 


It was accepted in the canon by the council at Laodicea 
(372) and at Carthage (397). Jerome accepted it for the 
Vulgate, though it was absent from the Peshito Syriac Ver- 
sion. Eusebius placed it among the disputed books, while 
Origen was inclined to accept it. Clement of Alexandria 
accepted it and apparently wrote a commentary on it. It 
is probable that the so-called Apocalypse of Peter (early 
second century) used it and the Epistle of Jude either used 
it or II Peter used Jude. There are undoubted allusions 
also to phrases in II Peter in Aristides, Justin Martyr, 
Ireneus, Ignatius, Clement of Rome. When one considers 
the brevity of the Epistle, the use of it is really as strong as 
139 


140 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


one can expect. Athanasius and Augustine accepted it as 
genuine, as did Luther, while Calvin doubted and Erasmus 
rejected it. It may be said for it that it won its way under 
criticism and was not accepted blindly. 


Ciaims PETRINE AUTHORSHIP 


Not only so, but in fuller form than I Peter 1:1, for the 
writer terms himself “Simon (Symeon in some MSS.) Peter,” 
a fact that has been used against the genuineness. If no 
claim had been made, that would have been considered de- 
cisive against him. Simon (Symeon was the Jewish form 
as used by James in Acts 15:14) is the real name (John 1:42) 
and Peter merely the Greek for Cephas, the nickname given 
by Christ. There is no reason why both could not properly 
be employed here. But the claim to Petrine authorship, if 
not genuine, leaves the Epistle pseudonymous. That was 
a custom among some Jewish writers and even: Christian 
writers, as the spurious Petrine literature testifies (Gospel 
of Peter, Apocalypse of Peter, etc.), works of a heretycal or 
curious nature. Whatever the motive for such a pious fraud, 
the fact remains that II Peter, if not genuine, has to take 
its place with this pseudonymous literature and can hardly 
be deemed worthy of a place in the New Testament. And 
yet there is no heresy in this Epistle, no startling new ideas 
that would lead one to use the name of Simon Peter. It is 
the rather full of edifying and orthodox teaching. | 


Anp PeEeRsonAL EXPERIENCES OF PETER 


The writer makes use of his own contact with Jesus, espe- 
cially at the Transfiguration of Christ (Mark 9:2-8 = Matt. 
17:1-8 =Luke g:28-36). This fact has been used against 
the genuineness of the Epistle on the plea that the writer 
is too anxious, anyhow, to show that he is Symeon Peter 
(1:1). But Bigg rightly replies that, if he had only given 
his name with no personal contacts with Jesus, the name 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 141 


would be called “‘a forged addition.” It is possible also 
that the experience on the Mount of Transfiguration may 
have been suggested by Peter’s use of exodos for his own 
death (1:15), the very word used by Luke (9:31) as the 
topic of discussion between Jesus and Moses and Elijah. 
There is also in 1:13 the use of “tent” (skénoma) for the 
life in the body, like Peter’s use of “tents” (skénas) to Jesus 
at that very time (Mark 9:5 =Matt. 17:4 =Luke 9:33). In 
1:14 Peter also refers to the plain words of Jesus about his 
coming death (John 21:18f.). In 1:15 Peter speaks of his 
own plan for preserving the knowledge of Jesus when he is 
gone (possibly by Mark’s Gospel). All this is in perfect 
keeping with Peter’s own nature. 


AND YET THE EpisTLe DiFFERS IN STYLE FROM FIRST PETER 


This is a fact, though one greatly exaggerated by some 
scholars. There are many points of similarity, for one thing, 
like the habit of repeating words (epichoréged in 1:10 and 
19, debaios in 1:12 and 13 and 15, prophéteia in 1:20 and 3:3, 
etc.). These repetitions occur all through the Epistle as in 
I Peter. “This is a matter of very high importance” (Bigg). 
Again in both Epistles there is a certain dignity of style 
with a tendency to iambic rhythm. There is more quotation 
of the Old Testament in I Peter, but frequent allusion to 
words and phrases in II Peter. There are more allusions 
to words and facts in the Gospels in I Peter than in II 
Peter, though some do occur in II Peter. Besides those al- 
ready given, note 1:8 (Luke 13:7f.), 2:1 (Matt. 10:33), 2:20 
(Matt. 12:45; Luke 11:26), 3:4 (Matt. 24:1ff.), and possibly 
1:3 to Christ’s calling the apostles. Both appear to know 
and use the O.T. Apocrypha. Both are fond of the plural 
of abstract substantives. Both make sparing use of Greek 
particles. Both use the article similarly, idiomatically, and 
sometimes not using it. There are some 361 words in I 
Peter not in II Peter, 231 in II Peter not in I Peter. There 


142 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


are 686 hapax legomena in N.T., 54 in II Peter instead of 
the average of 62, a large number when the brevity of the 
Epistle is considered. There are several ways of explaining 
these variations. One way is to say that they are written 
by different men, but difference of subject has to be borne 
in mind. All writers and artists have an early and a later 
manner. Another solution is that Peter employed different 
amanuenses. Silvanus was the one for I Peter (5:12). Mark 
was Peter’s usual interpreter, but we do not know who was 
the amanuensis for II Peter, if indeed one was used. We 
know from Acts 4:13 that Peter and John were considered 
unlettered men (agrammatoi kai ididtai). II Peter and the 
Apocalypse illustrate this statement. II Peter may have 
more of Peter’s real style than I Peter. 


He Accepts Paut’s EpisTtes AS SCRIPTURE 


This fact (3:15f.) has been used as conclusive proof by 
Baur and his school that Peter could not have written the 
Epistle. after the stern rebuke from Paul at Antioch (Gal. 
2:11f.). But this argument ignores one element in Peter’s 
impulsive nature and that is his coming back as he did with 
Jesus. Paul after that event in Antioch spoke kindly of 
Peter (I Cor. 9:5). Neither Peter nor Paul cherished a 
personal grudge where the Master’s work was involved. It 
is also objected that Peter would not have put Paul’s Epis- 
tles on the level with the O.T. and call them by implication | 
“Scripture.” But Paul claimed the help of the Holy Spirit 
in his writings and Peter knew the marks of the Holy Spirit’s 
power. Besides, in calling Paul’s Epistles Scripture he may 
not have meant to place them exactly on a par with the 
Old Testament. 


THE RESEMBLANCE TO THE EPISTLE OF JUDE 


This is undoubted, particularly between Jude and the 
second chapter of II Peter. Kuhl argues that II Peter 2:1 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 143 


to 3:2 is an interpolation, though the same style runs through- 
out the Epistle. “The theory of interpolation is always a 
last and desperate expedient” (Bigg). In II Peter 2 we 
have the fallen angels, the flood, the cities of the plain with 
Lot, Balaam. In Jude we have Israel in the wilderness, the 
fallen angels, the cities of the plain (with no mention of 
Lot, Cain, Balaam, Korah). Jude mentions the dispute be- 
tween Michael and Satan, quotes Enoch by name. There 
is rather more freshness in Jude than in II Peter, though 
II Peter is more intelligible. Evidently one had the other 
before him, besides other material. Which is the earlier? 
There is no way to decide this point clearly. Every point . 
is looked at differently and argued differently by different 
writers. My own feeling is that Jude was before (just be- 
fore) II Peter, though it is only a feeling and not a conviction. 


ANACHRONISMS 


It used to be said that it was impossible for II Peter to 
have been written in the first century, because it had the 
atmosphere of the second. But one fact is strongly against 
that argument. In II Pet. 3:8 occurs the quotation of Ps. 
go0:4 about the thousand years without any chiliastic turn 
at all, a thing sure to happen in the second century after 
chiliasm had come to have such a swing. Peter’s use of it 
suits the first century, not the second. As a matter of 
fact, the false teachers described in II Peter suit the first 
century precisely if one recalls Paul’s troubles with the 
Judaizers in Galatia and Corinth and with the Gnostics in 
Colosse and Ephesus. ‘Every feature in the description of 
the false teachers and mockers is to be found in the apostolic 


age” (Bigg). 
Tue READERS 


The author says that this is his second Epistle to them 
(3:1), and that means that he is writing to the saints in the 


144 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


five Roman provinces in Asia Minor to whom the first 
Epistle was sent (I Pet. 1:1). Spitta and Zahn deny this on 
the ground that the two Epistles do not discuss the same 
subjects, surely a flimsy objection. Zahn even holds that 
II Peter precedes I Peter and that the Epistle referred to in 
II Pet. 3:1 has been lost. He holds that II Peter was 
addressed to the church in Corinth. He considers the 
readers to be Jews while I Peter was addressed to Gentiles. 
But “there is nothing in II Peter to differentiate its first 
readers from those of I Peter” (Bigg). 


THE PurRPOSE 


Certainly Peter is here concerned chiefly with the heresies 
of that general region in Asia Minor that so disturbed Paul 
(Colossians, Ephesians, Pastoral Epistles) and John (Gospel, 
Epistles, Apocalypse). Paul early foresaw at Miletus these 
wolves that would ravish the sheep (Acts 20:20f.). In I 
Peter he is concerned chiefly with the fiery persecutions that 
are upon them, but here with the heretics that threaten to 
lead them astray. 


BALANCE OF PROBABILITY 


There are difficulties in any decision about the authorship 
and character of II Peter. But, when all things are con- 
sidered, I agree with Bigg that the Epistle is what it pro- 
fesses to be by Simon Peter. Else it is pseudonymous. The 
Epistle more closely resembles the other New Testament 
books than it does the large pseudepigraphic literature of the 
second and third centuries. 


Tue Date 


If we accept the Petrine authorship, it must come before 
his death, which was probably a.p. 67 or 68. Hence the 
Epistle cannot be beyond this date. There are those who 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 145 


argue for a.p. 64 as the date of Peter’s death, but on insuffi- 
cient grounds in my opinion.

CHAPTER I 


1. Simon Peter (Simon Petros). Aleph A K L P have 
Symeon as in Acts 15:14, while B has Simon. The two forms 
occur indifferently in I Macc. 2:3, 65 for the same man. 
Servant and apostle (doulos kai apostolos). Like Rom. 1:1; 
Titus 1:1. To them that have obtained (tois lachousin). Da- 
tive plural articular participle second aorist active of Jag- 
chand, old verb, to obtain by lot (Luke 1:9), here with the: 
accusative (pistin) asin Acts 1:17. Like precious (isotimon). 
Late compound adjective (isos, equal, timé, honor, price), 
here only in N.T. But this adjective (Field) is used in two 
ways, according to the two ideas in timé (value, honor), 
either like in value or like in honor. This second idea is the 
usual one with isotimos (inscriptions and papyri, Josephus, 
Lucian), while polutimos has the notion of price like timé 
in 1:7, 19; 2:4, 6f. The faith which they have obtained is 
like in honor and privilege with that of Peter or any of the 
apostles. With us (hémin). Associative-instrumental case 
after isotimon. Equal to téi hémon (the faith of us). In the 
righteousness (en dikaiosunéi). Definite because of the prep- 
Osition en and the following genitive even though anar- 
throus. The O.T. sense of dikaiosuné applied to God (Rom. 
1:17) and here to Christ. Of our God and Saviour Fesus 
Christ (tou theou hémon kai soteros Iésou Christou). So the 
one article (tou) with theou and sdtéros requires precisely as 
with tou kuriou hemon kai sotéros Iésou Christou (of our 
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ), one person, not two, in 
I:II as in 2:20; 3:2, 18. So in I Pet. 1:3 we have ho theos 
kai pater (the God and Father), one person, not two. The 
grammar is uniform and inevitable (Robertson, Grammar, 
p- 786), as even Schmiedel (Winer-Schmiedel, Grammatik, 

147 


148 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


p- 158) admits: “Grammar demands that one person be 
meant.” Moulton (Pro/., p. 84) cites papyri examples of 
like usage of theos for the Roman emperors. See the same 
idiom in Titus 2:13. The use of theos by Peter as a predicate 
with Jesus Christ no more disproves the Petrine authorship 
of this Epistle than a like use in John 1:1 disproves the 
Johannine authorship of the Fourth Gospel and the same 
use in Titus 2:13 disproves the genuineness of Titus. Peter 
had heard Thomas call Jesus God (John 20:28) and he 
himself had called him the Son of God (Matt. 16:16). 

2. Be multiplied (pléthuntheié). First aorist passive opta- 
tive of p/éthundé in a wish for the future (volitive use) as in 
I Pet. 1:2; Jude 2. In the knowledge (en epignosei). Full 
(additional, epi) knowledge as in 1:8 (only gvdsis in 1:5, 6; 
3:18), but epigndsin again in 1:3, 8; 2:20. As in Colossians, 
so here full knowledge is urged against the claims of the 
Gnostic heretics to special gndsis. Of God and of Fesus our 
Lord (tou theou kai Iésou tou kuriou hémén). At first sight 
the idiom here seems to require one person as in 1:1, though 
there is a second article (tou) before kuriou, and Tésou is a 
proper name. But the text here is very uncertain. Bengel, 
Spitta, Zahn, Nestle accept the short reading of P and some 
Vulgate MSS. and some minuscles with only tou kuriou 
hémon (our Lord) from which the three other readings may 
have come. Elsewhere in II Peter gndsis and epigndsis are 
used of Christ alone. The text of II Peter is not in a good 
state of preservation. 

3. Seeing that his divine power hath granted unto us (hos 
hémin tes theias dunameos autou dedorémenés). Genitive ab- 
solute with the causal particle 40s and the perfect middle 
participle of dared, old verb, to bestow (dorea, gift), usually 
middle as here, in N.T. elsewhere only Mark 15:45. Autou 
refers to Christ, who has “divine power” (tés theias duna- 
meos), since he is theos (1:1). Theios (from theos) is an old 
adjective in N.T. here and verse 4 only, except Acts 17:29, 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 149 


where Paul uses ¢o theion for deity, thus adapting his lan- 
guage to his audience as the papyri and inscriptions show. 
The use of theios with an imperial connotation is very com- 
mon in the papyri and the inscriptions. Deissmann (Bible 
Studies, pp. 360-368) has shown the singular linguistic like- 
ness between II Pet. 1:3 to 11 and a remarkable inscription 
of the inhabitants of Stratonicea in Caria to Zeus Pan- 
hemerios and Hecate dated a.p. 22 (in full in C I H ii No. 
2715 a b). One of the likenesses is the use of fés theias 
dunameods. Peter may have read this inscription (cf. Paul 
in Athens) or he may have used “the familiar forms and 
formule of religious emotion” (Deissmann), “the official . 
liturgical language of Asia Minor.”’ Peter is fond of dunamis 
in this Epistle, and the dunamis of Christ “is the sword 
which St. Peter holds over the head of the False Teachers” 
(Bigg). A/l things that pertain unto life and godliness (panta 
ta pros xoen kai eusebeian). “All the things for life and 
godliness.” The new life in Christ who is the mystery of 
godliness (I Tim. 3:16). Eusebeia with its cognates (eusedbés, 
eusebos, eusebed) occurs only in this Epistle, Acts, and the 
Pastoral Epistles (from ez, well, and sebomai, to worship). 
Of him that called us (tou kalesantos). Genitive of the artic- 
ular first aorist active participle of kaled. Christ called 
Peter and all other Christians. By his own glory and virtue 
(dia doxés kai aretés). So B KL, but Aleph A C P read 
idiai doxéi kai aretéi (either instrumental case “by” or da- 
tive “‘to”). Peter is fond of idios (own, I Pet. 3:1, 5; II 
Pet. 2:16, 22, etc.). ‘‘Glory” here is the manifestation of 
the Divine Character in Christ. For areté see on I Pet. 
2:9 and Phil. 4:8; II Pet. 1:5. 

4. Whereby (di? hon). Probably the “glory and virtue” 
just mentioned, though it is possible to take it with panta 
ta pros, etc., or with hémin (unto us, meaning “through 
whom”). He hath granted (dedorétai). Perfect middle in- 
dicative of dored, for which see verse 3. His precious and 


150 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


exceeding great promises (ta timia kai megista epaggelmata). 
Epaggelma is an old word (from epaggello) in place of the 
common epaggelia, in N.T. only here and 3:13. Timios 
(precious, from timé, value), three times by Peter (I Pet. 
1:7 of faith; 1:19 of the blood of Christ; II Pet. 1:4 of Christ’s 
promises). Megista is the elative superlative used along 
with a positive adjective (timia). That ye may become (hina 
genésthe). Purpose clause with hina and second aorist mid- 
dle subjunctive of ginomai. Through these (dia touton). The 
promises. Partakers (koindnoi). Partners, sharers in, for 
which word see I Pet. 5:1. Of the divine nature (theias 
phuseos). This phrase, like to theion in Acts 17:29, “‘belongs 
rather to Hellenism than to the Bible” (Bigg). It is a 
Stoic phrase, but not with the Stoic meaning. Peter is re- 
ferring to the new birth as I Pet. 1:23 (anagegennémenot). 
The same phrase occurs in an inscription possibly under the 
influence of Mithraism (Moulton and Milligan’s Vocabulary). 
Having escaped (apophugontes). Second aorist active par- 
ticiple of apopheugo, old compound verb, in N.T. only here 
and 2:18, 20, with the ablative here (phthords, old word 
from phtheird, moral decay as in 2:12) and the accusative 
there. By lust (en epithumiai). Caused by, consisting in, 
lust. “‘Man becomes either regenerate or degenerate” 
(Strachan). 

5. Yea, and for this very cause (kai auto touto de). Ad- 
verbial accusative (auto touto) here, a classic idiom, with . 
both kai and de. Cf. kai touto (Phil. 1:29), touto men—touto 
de (Heb. 10:33). ‘‘The soul of religion is the practical part” 
(Bunyan). Because of the new birth and the promises we 
have a part to play. Adding on your part (pareisenegkantes). 
First aorist active participle of pareispherd, old double com- 
pound, to bring in (eispherd), besides (para), here only in 
N.T. All diligence (spouden pasan). Old word from speudé 
to hasten (Luke 19:5f.). This phrase (pasan spoudén) oc- 
curs in Jude 3 with potoumenos and on the inscription in 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 151 


Stratonicea (verse 3) with ispheresthai (certainly a curious 
coincidence, to say the least, though common in the Koiné). 
In your faith (en ti pistei humon). Faith or pistis (strong 
conviction as in Heb. 11:1, 3, the root of the Christian life 
Eph. 2:8) is the foundation which goes through various steps 
up to love (agapé). See similar lists in James 1:30; I Thess. 
1:3; II Thess. 1:3f.; Gal. 5:22f.; Rom. 5:3f.; 8:29f. Hermas 
(Vis. iii. 8. 1-7) has a list called “daughters” of one an- 
other. Note the use of ex (in, on) with each step. Supply 
(epichorégésate). First aorist active imperative of epichoré- 
ged, late and rare double compound verb (epi and choréged 
I Pet. 4:11 from chorégos, chorus-leader, choros and hégeomat, 
to lead), to fit out the chorus with additional (complete) 
supplies. Both compound and simplex (more common) oc- 
cur in the papyri. In 1:11 and already in II Cor. 9:10; 
Gal. 3:5; Col. 2:19. Virtue (areten). Moral power, moral 
energy, vigor of soul (Bengel). See 3. Knowledge (gndsin). 
Insight, understanding (I Cor. 16:18; John 15:15). 

6. Temperance (tén egkrateian). Self-control. Old word 
(from egkratés, en and kratos, one holding himself in as in 
Titus 1:8), in N.T. only here, Acts 24:25; Gal. 5:23. The 
opposite of the pleonexia of the heretics. Patience (ten 
hupomonén). For which see James 1:3. Godliness (tén 
eusebeian). Yor which see verse 3. 

7. Love of the brethren (tén philadelphian). See I Pet. 1:22. 
Love (tén agapén). By deliberate choice (Matt. 5:44). Love 
for Christ as the crown of all (I Pet. 1:8) and so for all men. 
Love is the climax as Paul has it (I Cor. 13:13). 

8. For if these things are yours and abound (tauta gar humin 
huparchonta kai pleonazonta). Present active circumstantial 
(conditional) participles neuter plural of huparchd and ple- 
onazo (see I Thess. 3:12) with dative case humin, “‘these 
things existing for you (or in you) and abounding.” They 
make you to be (kathistésin). “Render” (present active in- 
dicative of kathistémi, old verb, James 3:6), singular because 


152 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


tauta neuter plural. Not idle nor unfruitful (ouk argous 
oude akarpous). Accusative predicative plural with humas 
understood, both adjectives with alpha privative, for argos 
see James 2:20 and for akarpos Matt. 13:22. Knowledge 
(epignosin). “Full (additional) knowledge” as in 1:2. 

9. He that lacketh these things (hoi mé parestin tauta). ““To 
whom (dative case of possession) these things are not (mé 
because a general or indefinite relative clause).” Seeing only 
what is near (muodpazon). Present active participle of muo- 
pazo, a rare verb from muops (in Aristotle for a near-sighted 
man) and that from mued tous Opas (to close the eyes in 
order to see, not to keep from seeing). The only other in- 
stance of mudpazo is given by Suicer from Ps. Dion. Eccl. 
Hier. ii. 3 (mudpasouséi kai apostrephomenéi) used of a soul 
on which the light shines (blinking and turning away). Thus 
understood the word here limits suphlos as a short-sighted 
man screwing up his eyes because of the light. Having 
forgotten (léthen labon). “Having received forgetfulness.” 
Second aorist active participle of /amband and accusative 
lethen, old word, from /éthomai, to forget, here only in N.T. 
See II Tim. 1:5 for a like phrase hupomnésin labon (having 
received remembrance). The cleansing (tou katharismou). 
See Heb. 1:3 for this word for the expiatory sacrifice of 
Christ for our sins as in I Pet. 1:18; 2:24; 3:18. In I Pet. 
3:21 Peter denied actual cleansing of sin by baptism (only 
symbolic). If there is a reference to baptism here, which 
is doubtful, it can only be in a symbolic sense. Old (palai). 
Of the language as in Heb. 1:1. 

10. Wherefore (dio). Because of the exhortation and ar- 
gument in verses 5-9. Give the more diligence (mallon spou- 
dasate). “‘Become diligent (first aorist ingressive active 
imperative of spoudazo as in II Tim. 2:15; II Pet. 1:15) the 
more” (mallon, not less). To make (poieisthai). Present 
middle infinitive of poicd, to make for yourselves. Calling 
and election (klésin kai eklogen). Both words (klésin, the 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 153 


invitation, eklogén, actual acceptance). See for eklogé I 
Thess. 1:4; Rom. 9:11. If ye do (poiountes). Present active 
circumstantial (conditional) - participle of poied, “doing.” 
Ye shall never stumble (ou mé ptaiséte pote). Strong double 
negative (ou mé pote) with first aorist active subjunctive 
of ptaid, old verb to stumble, to fall as in James 2:10; 3:2. 

11. Thus (houtés). As shown in verse 10. Shall be sup- 
plied (epichorégéthésetai). Future passive of epichoréged, for 
which see verse 5. You supply the virtues above and God 
will supply the entrance (Aé eisodos, old word already in 
I Thess. 1:9, etc.). Richly (plousids). See Col. 3:16 for 
this adverb. Into the eternal kingdom (eis ten aidnion basi-- 
leian). The believer’s inheritance of I Pet. 1:4 is here termed 
kingdom, but “eternal” (aidnion feminine same as mas- 
culine). Curiously again in the Stratonicea inscription we 
find ¢és aidniou archés (of the eternal rule) applied to “the 
lords of Rome.” But this is the spiritual reign of God in 
men’s hearts here on earth (I Pet. 2:9) and in heaven. Of 
our Lord and Saviour Fesus Christ (tou kuriou hémon kai 
sotéros Ié@sou Christou). For which idiom see on 1:1. 

12. Wherefore (dio). Since they are possessed of faith 
that conduces to godliness which they are diligently prac- 
tising now he insists on the truth and proposes to do his 
part by them about it. I shall be ready always (melléso aei). 
Future active of me//é (Matt. 24:6), old verb, to be on the 
point of doing and used with the infinitive (present, aorist, 
or future). It is not here a periphrastic future, but rather 
the purpose of Peter to be ready in the future as in the past 
and now (Zahn). To put you in remembrance (humas hupo- 
mimneéskein). Present active infinitive of hupomimnésko, 
old causative compound (Aupo, mimnéské, like our suggest), 
either with two accusatives (John 14:26) or peri with the 
thing as here), “to keep on reminding you of those things” 
(peri touton). Though ye know them (kaiper eidotas). Second 
perfect active concessive participle of oida, agreeing (acc. 


154 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


plural), with Aumas. Cf. Heb. 5:8. Are established (esterig- 
menous). Perfect passive concessive participle of sterizo (I 
Pet. 5:10). The very verb (stérison) used by Jesus to Peter 
(Luke 22:32). In the truth which is with you (en téi parouset 
aletheiai). ‘‘In the present truth” (the truth present to 
you), parouséi present active participle of pareimi, to be be- 
side one. See Col. 1:6 for this use of pardn. Firmly estab- 
lished in the truth, but all the same Peter is eager to make 
them stronger. 

13. I think it right (dikaion hégoumai). Peter considers 
this to be his solemn duty, “right” (dikaion). Cf. Phil. 
3:1; Eph. 6:1. So long as (eph’ hoson). For this phrase see 
Matt. 9:15; Rom. 11:13. Tabernacle (skéndmati). Old word, 
in literal sense in Deut. 33:18 for the usual skéné (Peter’s 
word at the Transfiguration, Mark 9:5), earliest use (in 
N.T. only here, verse 14; Acts 7:46 of the tabernacle of the 
covenant) in this metaphorical sense of life as a pilgrimage 
(I Pet. 1:1; 2:11), though Paul has skévos, so in II Cor. 
$:1, 4. Peter feels the nearness of death and the urgency 
upon him. To stir you up (diegeirein humas). Present ac- 
tive infinitive of diegeiro, late (Arist., Hippocr., Herodian, 
papyri), perfective (dia=thoroughly) compound, to wake 
out of sleep (Mark 4:39), “to keep on rousing you up.” 
By putting you in remembrance (en hupomnesei). Old word, 
from hupomimnésko (verse 12), in N.T. only here, 3:1; ul 
Tim. 15. “By way of reminding you.” 

14. The putting off of my tabernacle (hé apothesis tou skén- 
nomatos mou). For apothesis see on I Pet. 3:21 and for 
skéenoma verse 13. For the metaphor see II Cor. 5:3f. 
Cometh swiftly (tachiné estin). Wate adjective (Theocritus, 
LXX, inscription), in N.T. only here and 2:1. It is not 
clear whether ‘achinos means soon or speedy as in Is. 59:7 
and like tachus in James 1:19, or sudden, like ¢achus in 
Plato (Repudl. 553 D). Either sense agrees with the urgent 
tone of Peter here, whether he felt his death to be near or 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 155 


violent or both. Signified unto me (edelisen moi). First 
aorist active indicative of délod, old verb (from delos), as 
in I Pet. 1:11. Peter refers to the incident told in John 
21:18f., which he knew by personal experience before John 
wrote it down. ! 

15. Peter may also have had an intimation by vision of 
his approaching death (cf. the legend Domine quo vadis) as 
Paul often did (Acts 16:9; 18:9; 21:11; 23:11; a7 i gieeast 
every time (hekastote). As need arises, old adverb, here alone 
in N.T. After my decease (meta ten emén exodon). For 
exodos meaning death see Luke 9:31, and for departure from 
Egypt (way out, ex, hodos) see Heb. 11:22, the only other 
N.T. examples. Here again Peter was present on the Trans- 
figuration mount when the talk was about the “exodus” 
of Jesus from earth. That ye may be able (echein humas). 
Literally, “that ye may have it,” the same idiom with 
echo and the infinitive in Mark 14:8; Matt. 18:25. It is the 
object-infinitive after spoudasé (I will give diligence, for 
which see verse 10). To call these things to remembrance 
(tén toutén mnémén poicisthai). Present middle infinitive of 
poied (as in verse 10). Munémé is an old word (from mnao- 
mai), here alone in N.T. This idiom, like the Latin men- 
tionem facere, is common in the old writers (papyri also both 
for “mention” and “remembrance”), here only in N.T., 
but in Rom. 1:20 we have mneian poioumai (I make men- 
tion). Either sense suits here. It is possible, as Irenzeus 
(iii. 1. 1) thought, that Peter had in mind Mark’s Gospel, 
which would help them after Peter was gone. Mark’s 
Gospel was probably already written at Peter’s suggestion, 
but Peter may have that fact in mind here. 

16. We did not follow (ouk exakolouthésantes). First aorist 
active participle of exakolouthed, late compound verb, to 
follow out (Polybius, Plutarch, LXX, papyri, inscriptions 
as of death following for any Gentile in the temple violating 
the barrier), with emphatic negative ouk, “not having fol- 


1456 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


lowed.” See also 2:2 for this verb. Cunningly devised fables 
(sesophismenois muthois). Associative instrumental case of 
muthos (old term for word, narrative, story, fiction, fable, 
falsehood). In N.T. only here and the Pastoral Epistles 
(I Tim. 1:4, etc.). Perfect passive participle of sophizd, old 
word (from sophos), only twice in N.T., in causative sense 
to make wise (II Tim. 3:15), to play the sophist, to invent 
cleverly (here) and so also in the old writers and in the 
papyri. Some of the false teachers ‘apparently taught that 
the Gospel miracles were only allegories and not facts 
(Bigg). Cf. 2:3 for “feigned words.” When we made known 
unto you (egnorisamen humin). First aorist active indica- 
tive of gndrizd, to make known unto you. Possibly by Peter 
himself. The power and coming (tén dunamin kai parousian). 
These words can refer (Chase) to the Incarnation, just as 
is true of epiphancia in II Tim. 1:10 (second coming in 
I Tim. 6:14), and is true of parousia (II Cor. 7:6 of Titus). 
But elsewhere in the N.T. parousia (technical term in the 
papyri for the coming of a king or other high dignitary), 
when used of Christ, refers to his second coming (II Pet. 
3:4, 12). But we were eye-witnesses (all epoptai genéthentes). 
First aorist passive participle of ginomai, “but having be- 
come eye-witnesses.” Epoptai, old word (from epopto like 
epopteud in I Pet. 2:12; 3:2), used of those who attained the 
third or highest degree of initiates in the Eleusinian mys- 
teries (common in the inscriptions). Cf. autoptés in Luke . 
1:2. Of his majesty (tés ekeinou megaleiotétos). Late and 
rare word (LXX and papyri) from megaleios (Acts 2:11), 
in N.T. only here, Luke 9:43 (of God); Acts 19:27 (of 
Artemis). Peter clearly felt that he and James and John 
were lifted to the highest stage of initiation at the Trans- 
figuration of Christ. Emphatic ekeinou as in II Tim. 2:26. 

17. For he received (labon gar). Second aorist active par- 
ticiple nominative singular of Jamband, “he having received,” 
but there is no finite verb, anacoluthon, changing in verse 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 157 


19 (after parenthesis in 18) to echomen bebaioteron rather 
than ebebaidsen. When there came such a voice to him (phones 
enechthetsés autoi toiasde): Genitive absolute with first 
aorist passive participle feminine singular of pherad (cf. I 
Pet. 1:13), repeated enechtheisan in verse 18. Phdné (voice) 
is used also of Pentecost (Acts 2:6). Toiosde (classical de- 
monstrative) occurs here alone intheN.T. From the excellent 
glory (hupo tés megaloprepous doxés). “By the majestic 
glory.” Megaloprepés, old compound (megas, great, prepei, 
it is becoming), here only in N.T., several times in O.T., 
Apocr. (II Macc. 8:15), adverb in the inscriptions. Prob- 
ably a reference to nephelé phiteiné (bright cloud, shekinah) 
in Matt. 17:5. The words given here from the “voice” 
agree exactly with Matt. 17:5 except the order and the use 
of eis hon rather than en hoi. Mark (9:7) and Luke (9:35) 
have akouete. But Peter did not need any Gospel for his 
report here. 

18. This voice (tautén ten phonen). The one referred to 
in verse 17. We heard (ehousamen). First aorist active in- 
dicative of akoud, a definite experience of Peter. Brought 
(enechtheisan). ‘‘Borne” as in verse 17. When we were 
with him (sun autoi ontes). Present active participle of 
eimi, “being with him.” Jn the holy mount (en toi hagidi 
oret). Made holy by the majestic glory. See Ezek. 28:14 
for “holy mount of God,” there Sinai, this one probably 
one of the lower slopes of Hermon. Peter’s account is inde- 
pendent of the Synoptic narrative, but agrees with it in all 
essentials. 

19. The word of prophecy (ton prophétikon logon). ‘The 
prophetic word.” Cf. I Pet. 1:10, a reference to all the 
Messianic prophecies. Made more sure (bebaioteron). Pred- 
icate accusative of the comparative adjective bebaios (II 
Pet. 1:10). The Transfiguration scene confirmed the Mes- 
sianic prophecies and made clear the deity of Jesus Christ 
as God’s Beloved Son. Some with less likelihood take Peter 


158 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


to mean that the word of prophecy is a surer confirmation 
of Christ’s deity than the Transfiguration. Whereunto (ho1). 
Dative of the relative referring to “the prophetic word made 
more sure.” That ye take heed (prosechontes). Present ac- 
tive participle with zoun (mind) understood, “holding your 
mind upon” with the dative (402). As unto a lamp (hos 
luchnoi). Dative also after prosechontes of luchnos, old word 
(Matt. 5:15). Shining (phainonti). Dative also present 
active participle of phaind, to shine (John 1:5). So of the 
Baptist (John 5:35). In a dark place (en auchméroi topo). 
Old adjective, parched, squalid, dirty, dark, murky, here 
only in N.T., though in Aristotle and on tombstone for a 
boy. Until the day dawn (heds hou hémera diaugasét). First 
aorist active subjunctive of diaugazd with temporal con- 
junction Aeds hou, usual construction for future time. Late 
compound verb diaugazd (Polybius, Plutarch, papyri) from 
dia and augé, to shine through, here only in N.T. The 
day-star (phosphoros). Old compound adjective (phos, light, 
phero, to bring), light-bringing, light-bearer (Lucifer) applied 
to Venus as the morning star. Our word phosphorus is this 
word. In the LXX hedsphoros occurs. Cf. Mal. 4:2 and 
Luke 1:76-79; Rev. 22:16 for “dawn” applied to the Mes- 
siah. Arise (anateiléi). First aorist active subjunctive of 
anatelld (James 1:11; Matt. 5:45). 

20. Knowing this first (touto proton gindskontes). Agree- 
ing with poieite like prosechontes in verse 19. No prophecy 
of Scripture (pasa prophéteia ou). Like the Hebrew /o-kol, 
but also in the papyri as in I John 2:21 (Robertson, Gram- 
mar, p. 753). Is (ginetai). Rather “comes,” “springs” 
(Alford), not “‘is” (estin). Of private interpretation (idias 
epiluseds). Ablative case of origin or source in the predicate 
as with gndmés in Acts 20:3 and with tou theou and ex hémon 
in II Cor. 4:7. “No prophecy of Scripture comes out of 
private disclosure,” not “of private interpretation.” The 
usual meaning of epilusis is explanation, but the word does 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 159 


not occur elsewhere in the N.T. It occurs in the papyri in 
the sense of solution and even of discharge of a debt. Spitta 
urges “dissolved” as the idea here. The verb epilud, to 
unloose, to untie, to release, occurs twice in the N.T., once 
(Mark 4:34) where it can mean “disclose” about parables, 
the other (Acts 19:39) where it means to decide. It is the 
prophet’s grasp of the prophecy, not that of the readers 
that is here presented, as the next verse shows. 

21. For (gar). The reason for the previous statement 
that no prophet starts a prophecy himself. He is not a self- 
starter. Came (énechthé). First aorist passive indicative of 
phero (verses 17f.). By the will of man (thelemati anthropou). - 
Instrumental case of theléma. Prophecy is of divine origin, 
not of one’s private origination (idias epiluseds). Moved 
by the Holy Ghost (hupo pneumatos hagiou pheromenoi). 
Present passive participle of pherd, moved from time to 
time. There they “spoke from God.” Peter is not here 
warning against personal interpretation of prophecy as the 
Roman Catholics say, but against the folly of upstart 
prophets with no impulse from God. 


CHAPTER II 


1. But there arose (egenonto de). Second aorist middle in. 
dicative of ginomai (cf. ginetai in 1:20). False prophets also 
(kai pseudoprophétai). In contrast with the true prophets 
just pictured in 1:20f. Late compound in LXX and Philo, 
common in N.T. (Matt. 7:15). Allusion to the O.T. times 
like Balaam and others (Jer. 6:13; 28:9; Ezek. 13:9). False 
teachers (pseudodidaskaloi). Late and rare compound (pseu- 
dés, didaskalos) here alone in N.T. Peter pictures them as 
in the future here (esontai, shall be) and again as already 
present (eisin, are, verse 17), or in the past (eplanéthésan, 
they went astray, verse 15). Shall privily bring in (paret- 
saxousin). Future active of pareisagd, late double com- 
pound pareisagé, to bring in (eisagd), by the side (para), as 
if secretly, here alone in N.T., but see pareisaktous in Gal. 
2:4 (verbal adjective of this same verb). Destructive herestes 
(haireseis apoleias). Descriptive genitive, “heresies of de- 
struction” (marked by destruction) as in Luke 16:8. Haz- 
resis (from haired) is simply a choosing, a school, a sect like 
that of the Sadducees (Acts 5:17), of the Pharisees (Acts 
15:5), and of Christians as Paul admitted (Acts 24:5). These 
“tenets” (Gal. 5:20) led to destruction. Denying (arnou- . 
menoi). Present middle participle of arneomai. This the 
Gnostics did, the very thing that Peter did, alas (Matt. 
26:70) even after Christ’s words (Matt. 10:33). Even the 
Master (kai ton despotén). Old word for absolute master, 
here of Christ as in Jude 4, and also of God (Acts 4:24). 
Without the evil sense in our “despot.” That bought them 
(ton agorasanta autous). First aorist active articular par- 
ticiple of agorazd, same idea with /utrod in I Pet. 1:18f. 
These were professing Christians, at any rate, these heretics. 

160 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 161 


Swift destruction (tachinén apileian). See 1:14 for tachinén 
and note repetition of apdleian. This is always the tragedy 
of such false prophets, the fate that they bring on (epagontes) 
themselves. 

2. Lascivious doings (aselgeiais). Associative instrumental 
case after exakolouthésousin (future active, for which verb 
see 1:16). See I Pet. 4:3 for this word. By reason of whom 
(di’ hous). “Because of whom” (accusative case of relative, 
referring to polloi, many). 4uton (their) refers to pseudodi- 
daskaloi (false teachers) while polloi to their deluded fol- 
lowers. See Rom. 2:23f. for a picture of such conduct by 
Jews (quotation from Is. 52:5, with d/asphémed used as here 
with di’ humas, because of you). The way of truth (hé hodos 
tes alétheias). Hodos (way) occurs often in N.T. for Chris- 
tianity (Acts 9:2; 16:17; 18:25; 22:4; 24:14). This phrase 
is in Gen. 24:48 as “the right road,” and that is what Peter 
means here. So Ps. 119:30. See again 2:16, 21, 

3. In covetousness (en pleonexiai). As did Balaam (verse 
15). These licentious Gnostics made money out of their 
dupes. A merely intellectual Gnosticism had its fruit in 
immorality and fraud. With feigned words (plastois logois). 
Instrumental case. Plastos is verbal adjective (from plasso, 
to mould as from clay, for which see Rom. 9:20), here only 
in N.T. “With forged words.” See sample in 3:4. Shall 
make merchandise of you (humas emporeusontai). Future 
middle of emporeuomai (from emporos, a travelling mer- 
chant), old word, to go in for trade, in N.T. only here and 
James 4:13, which see. Cf. our emporium (John 2:16, 
market house). Whose sentence (hois to krima). ‘For whom 
(dative case) the sentence” (verdict, not process krisis). 
Now from of old (ekpalai). Wate and common compound 
adverb, in N.T. only here and 3:5. Lingereth not (ouk arget). 
“Ts not idle,” old verb, arged (from argos not working, alpha 
privative and ergon), here only in N.T. Slumbereth not (ou 
nustazei). Old and common verb (from nué to nod), in 


162 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


N.T. only here and Matt. 25:5. Note apdleia (destruction) 
three times in verses I to 3. 

4. For if God spared not (2i gar ho theos ouk epheisato). 
First instance (gar) of certain doom, that of the fallen 
angels. Condition of the first class precisely like that in 
Rom. 11:21 save that here the normal apodosis (humon ou 
pheisetat) is not expressed as there, but is simply implied 
in verse g by oiden kurios ruesthai (the Lord knows how to 
deliver) after the parenthesis in verse 8. Angels when they 
sinned (aggelon hamartésanton). Genitive case after epheisato 
(first aorist middle indicative of pheidomai) and anarthrous 
(so more emphatic, even angels), first aorist active participle 
of hamartanod, “having sinned.” Cast them down to hell 
(tartarosas). First aorist active participle of sartarod, late 
word (from tartaros, old word in Homer, Pindar, LXX Job 
40:15; 41:23, Philo, inscriptions, the dark and doleful abode 
of the wicked dead like the Gehenna of the Jews), found 
here alone save in a scholion on Homer. Tartaros occurs in 
Enoch 20:2 as the place of punishment of the fallen angels, 
while Gehenna is for apostate Jews. Committed (paredoken). 
First aorist active indicative of paradidomi, the very form 
solemnly used by Paul in Rom. 1:21, 26, 28. To pits of 
darkness (seirois zophou). Zophos (kin to gnophos, nephos) 
is an old word, blackness, gloom of the nether world in 
Homer, in N.T. only here, verse 17; Jude 13; Heb. 12:18. 
The MSS. vary between seirais (seira, chain or rope) and 
seirois (seiros, old word for pit, underground granary). 
Seirois is right (Aleph A B C), dative case of destination. 
To be reserved unto judgment (eis krisin teroumenous). Present 
(linear action) passive participle of téred. “Kept for judg- 
ment.” Cf. I Pet. 1:4. Aleph A have kolazomenous térein 
as in verse 9. Note krisis (act of judgment). 

s. The ancient world (archaiou kosmou). Genitive case 
after epheisato (with ei understood) repeated (the second 
example, the deluge). This example not in Jude. Absence 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 163 


of the article is common in the prophetic style like II Peter. 
For archaios see Luke 9:8. Preserved (ephulaxen). Still 
part of the long protasis with ¢, first aorist active indicative 
of phulassd. With seven others (ogdoon). “Eighth,” predi- 
cate accusative adjective (ordinal), classic idiom usually 
with auton. Seel Pet. 3:20 for this same item. Some take 
ogdoon with kéruka (eighth preacher), hardly correct. 4 
preacher of righteousness (dikaiosunés keruka). “Herald” as 
in I Tim. 2:7; II Tim. 1:11 alone in N.T., but kérussd is 
common. It is implied in I Pet. 3:20 that Noah preached 
to the men of his time during the long years. When he 
brought (epaxas). First aorist active participle (instead of 
the common second aorist active epagagin) of eisagd, old ~ 
compound verb to bring upon, in N.T. only here and Acts 
5:28 (by Peter herealso). 4 flood (kataklusmon). Old word 
(from katakluxd, to inundate), only of Noah’s flood in N.T. 
(Matt. 24:38.; Luke 17:27; II Pet. 2:5). Upon the world

of tephrod, late word from tephra, ashes (in Dio Cassius of an 
eruption of Vesuvius, Philo), here aloneinN.T. The cities of 
Sodom and Gomorrah (poleis Sodomin kai Gomorrdas). Geni- 
tive of apposition after poleis (cities), though it makes sense 
as possessive genitive, for Jude 7 speaks of the cities around 
these two. The third example, the cities of the plain. See 
Gen. 19:24f. Condemned them (katekrinen). First aorist 
active indicative of katakrind, still part of the protasis with e7. 
With an overthrow (katastrophéi). Instrumental case or even 
dative like thanatoi with katakrind in Matt. 20:18. But 
Westcott and Hort reject the word here because not in B C 
Coptic. Having made them (tethetkos). Perfect active par- 
ticiple of zith@mi. An example (hupodeigma). For which 
see James 5:10; John 13:15. Cf. I Pet. 2:21. Unto those 


1644 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


that should live ungodly (mellonton asebesin). Rather, “unto 
ungodly men of things about to be” (see Heb. 11:20 for this 
use of mellonton). But Aleph A C K L read asebein (present 
active infinitive) with mellonton =asebésonton (future active 
participle of asebed), from which we have our translation. 

7. And delivered (kai erusato). First aorist middle of 
ruomai as in Matt. 6:13, still part of the protasis with ¢i. 
Righteous Lot (dikaion Lot). This adjective dikaios occurs

aselgeiai anastrophés). “By the life in lasciviousness of the 
lawless.” Athesmos (alpha privative and thesmos), late and

participle of enkatoiked, old but rare double compound, here

Accusative of time and ablative with ex. Same idiom in 
Ps. 96:2 for the more common ex Aémeras eis hémeran.

basanizo, old word, to test metals, to-torment (Matt. 8:29).

in Matt. 7:11; James 4:17. The godly (eusebeis). Old 
anarthrous adjective (from ez and sebomai, to worship), in

Present active infinitive of téred after oiden. Unrighteous 
(adikous). As in I Pet. 3:18. Under punishment (kolaxo- 
menous). Present passive participle of ko/azo, old verb (from 
kolos, lopped off), in N.T. only here and Acts 4:21. Present 
tense emphasises continuity of the punishment. See kolasin 
aionion in Matt. 25:46. 

10. Chiefly (malista). Especially. He turns now to the 
libertine heretics (verses 2,7). After the flesh (opiso sarkos).

word (from miaind Tit. 1:15), here only in N.T. Despise 
dominion (kuriotétos kataphronountas). Kuriotés is ate word

Titus. 1:7. They tremble not to rail at dignities (doxas ou 
tremousin blasphémountes). ‘They tremble not blaspheming 
dignities.” Trem@ is old verb (Mark 5:33), used only in 
present as here and imperfect. Here with the complemen- 
tary participle d/asph?mountes rather than the infinitive 
blasphemein. See Jude 8. Perhaps these dignities (doxas) 
are angels (evz/). 

11. Whereas (hopou). Loose use of hopou (in Xenophon) = 
“wherein.” Though greater (meizones ontes). Than the evil 
doxai. Concessive participle and comparative adjective. In 


166 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT

(alive), Jude 10; Rev. 4, 6-9. Without reason (aloga). Old

stroyed (kai phthoran). “And for destruction” just like a 
beast of prey caught. See 1:4. In matters whereof they are 
ignorant (en hois agnoousin). ‘In which things they are 
ignorant.” Here en hois=en toutois ha (in those things 
which), a common Greek idiom. For agnoeo (present active 
indicative) see I Thess. 4:13 and I Tim. 1:7 for alike picture 
of loud ignoramuses posing as professional experts. Shall 
in their destroying surely be destroyed (en téi phthorai auton 
phtharésontai). Second future passive of phtheird. Rhe- 
torical Hebraism in the use of en phthorai (same root as 
phthetro), word four times in II Peter. See Jude 10. 

13. Suffering wrong (adikoumenoi). Present middle or 
passive participle of adiked to do wrong. So Aleph B P, 
but A C K L have komioumenoi (future middle participle 
of komizd), shall receive. As the hire: of wrong-doing (mis- 
thon adikias). The Elephantine papyrus has the passive of 
adikeo in the sense of being defrauded, and that may be the 
idea here. Peter plays on words again here as often in II 
Peter. The picture proceeds now with participles like hégou- 
menot (counting). Pleasure (hédonén). See James 4:1, 3. 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 167 


To revel in the daytime (tén en hémerai truphén). “The in 
the daytime revel” (old word ¢ruphé from thrupto, to ener- 
vate, in N.T. only here and Luke 7:25). Spots (spiloi). 
Old word for disfiguring spot, in N.T. only here and Eph. 
5:27. Blemishés (mimoi). Old word for blot (kin to mud), 
only here in N.T. See I Pet. 1:19 for amdmos kai aspilos. 
Revelling (entruphontes). Present active participle of en- 
truphad, old compound fér living in luxury, only here in 
N.T. In their love-feasts.(en tais agapais). So B Sah, but 
Aleph A C K L P read apatais (in their deceivings). If 
agapais is genuine as it is in Jude 12, they are the only N.T. 
examples of this use of agapé. While they feast with you 
(suneudchoumenoi). Present passive participle of late and 
rare verb suneudched (sun, together, and eudched, to feed 
abundantly) to entertain with. Clement of Alex. (Paed. 
ii. 1. 6) applies eudchia to the agapé. 

14. Of adultery (moichalidos). Rather, “of an adulteress,”’ 
like James 4:4. Vivid picture of a man who cannot see a 
woman without lascivious thoughts toward her (Mayor). . 
Cf. Matt. 5:28. That cannot cease (akatapastous). Reading 
of A B in place of akatapaustous (alpha privative and verbal 
of katapaus, to cease). “Unable to stop.” This a late 
verbal, only here in N.T. It is probable that akatapastous 
is merely a misspelling of akatapaustous. From sin (hamar- 
tias). Ablative case as in I Pet. 4:1 (hamartias). Insatiable 
lust. Enticing (deleazontes). Present active participle of 
deleazd, to catch by bait as in verse 18 and James 1:14. 
Unsteadfast (asteriktous). Late verbal adjective (alpha priva~ 
tive and siériza), in Longinus and Vettius Valens, here alone 
in N.T. Exercised (gegumnasmenén). Perfect passive pred- 
icate participle with echontes, from gumuazo precisely as in 
Heb. ¢:14. Rhetorical metaphor from the gymnasium. In

Children of cursing (kataras tekna). Hebraism like rekna 
hupakoés in I Pet. 1:14 =accursed (kataratot). 


168 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


15. Forsaking (kataleipontes). Present active participle of 
kataleipo (continually leaving) or katalipontes (second aorist 
active), having left. The right way (eutheian hodon). “‘The 
straight way” of I Sam. 12:23 (cf. Matt. 7:13f. for this 
use of hodos), “the way of truth” (2:2). They went astray 
(eplanéthésan). First aorist passive indicative of planad, 
like Mark 12:24. The way of Balaam (te hoddi tou Balaam). 
Associative instrumental case after exakolouthésantes, for 
which verb see 1:16; 2:2. These false teachers, as shown in 
verse 13, followed the way of Balaam, “who loved the hire 
of wrong-doing” (hos misthon adikias égapésen). 

16. But he was rebuked (elegxin de eschen). “But he had 
rebuke.” Second aorist active indicative of echd and accusa- 
tive of elegxis (late word from elegchi, a periphrasis for 
elegcho, here only in N.T. For his own transgression (idias 
paranomias). Objective genitive of paranomia, old word 
(from paranomos lawbreaker), here only in N.T. 4 dumb 
ass (hupozugion aphonon). Dumb is without voice, old word 
for idols and beasts. The adjective hupozugios (hupo zugon 
on) ‘being under a yoke,” is applied to the ass as the com- 
mon beast of burden (papyri, Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 
160), in N.T. only here and Matt. 21:5. Spake (phthegxa- 
menon). First aorist middle participle of phtheggomai, old 
verb, to utter a sound, in N.T. only here, verse 18, Acts 
4:18. Stayed (ekdlusen). First aorist active indicative of 
kolud, to hinder. Madness (paraphronian). Only known . 
example of this word instead of the usual paraphrosuné or 
paraphronésis. It is being beside one’s wits. 

17. Without water (anudroi). As in Matt. 12:43; Luke 
11:24. Old word for common and disappointing experience 
of travellers in the orient. Mists (homichlai). Old word for 
fog, here alone in N.T. Driven by a storm (hupo lailapos 
elaunomenai). Lailaps is a squall (Mark 4:37; Luke 8. 23, 
only other N.T. examples). See James 3:4 for another ex- 
ample of elauné for driving power of wind and waves. For 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 169 


whom (hois). Dative case of personal interest. The black- 
ness (ho zophos). See verse 4 for this word. Hath been re- 
served (teterétai). Perfect passive participle of séred, for 
which see verses 4andg.

jective (huper and ogkos, a swelling, swelling above and 
beyond), in N.T. only here and Jude 16. Of vanity (matai- 
otétos). Late and rare word (from mataios, empty, vain), 
often in LXX, in N.T. here, Rom. 8:20; Eph. 4:17. By 
lasciviousness (aselgeiais). Instrumental plural, “by lascivi- 
ous acts.” Note asyndeton as in 1:9, 17. Those who are 
just escaping (tous oligds apopheugontas). SoAB read oligos 
(slightly, a little), while Aleph C K L P read ontos (actually). 
Oligés late and rare, only here in N.T. So again the Textus 
Receptus has apophugontas (second aorist active participle, 
clean escaped) while the correct text is the present active 
apopheugontas. From them that live in error (tous en planéi 
anastrephomenous). Accusative case after apopheugontas 
(escaping from) according to regular idiom. Peter often 
uses anastrepho and anastrophe. 

19. Liberty (eleutherian). Promising “personal liberty,” 
that is license, after the fashion of advocates of liquor today, 
not the freedom of truth in Christ (John 8:32; Gal. 5:1, 13). 
Themselves bondservants (autoi douloi). “Themselves slaves” 
of corruption and sin as Paul has it in Rom. 6:20. Of whom 
(Adi). Instrumental case, but it may mean “of what.” 
Is overcome (héttétai). Perfect passive indicative of éttad 
(from hétton, less) old verb, in N.T. only here, verse 20; 
II Cor. 12:13. Of the same (toutdi). “By this one (or 
thing).” Is brought into bondage (dedoulotai). Perfect pas- 
sive indicative of doulod. Like Paul again (Rom. 6:16, 18; 
8:21). 

20. After they have escaped (apophugontes). Second aorist 
active participle here (see verse 18). The defilements (ta 
miasmata). Old word miasma, from miaind, here only in 


170 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


N.T. Our “miasma.” The body is. sacred to God. Cf. 
miasmou in verse 10. They are again entangled (palin em- 
plakentes). Second aorist passive participle of empleké, old 
verb, to inweave (noosed, fettered), in N.T. only here and 
II Tim. 2:4. Overcome (héttontai). Present passive indica- 
tive of héttaod, for which see verse 19, “are repeatedly 
worsted.” Predicate in the condition of first class with ei. 
It is not clear whether the subject here js “the deluded 
victims” (Bigg) or the false teachers themselves (Mayor). 
See Heb. 10:26 for a parallel. Therein (toutois). So locative 
case (in these “‘defilements”), but*it can be instrumental 
case (“‘by these,” Strachan). With them (autois). Dative 
of disadvantage, “for them.” Than the Jirst (ton proton). 
Ablative case after the comparative cheirona. See this moral 
drawn by Jesus (Matt. 12:45; Luke11:26),. 

21. Lt were better (kreitton én). Apodosis of a condition 
of second class without az, as is usual with clauses of pos- 
sibility, propriety, obligation (Matt. 26:24; I Cor. 5:10; 
Rom. 7:7; Heb. 9:26). Not to have known (mé epegnokenai). 
Perfect active infinitive of epiginasko (cf. epignosei, verse 
20) to know fully. The way of righteousness (t@n hodon tés 
dikatosunés). For the phrase see Matt. 21 233, also the way 
of truth (2:2), the straight way (2:15). After knowing it 
(epignousin). Second aorist active participle of epigindskd 
(just used) in the dative plural agreeing with autois (for 
them). To turn back (hupostrepsai). First aorist active in. 
finitive of hupostrepho, old and common verb, to turn back, 
to return. From (ek). Out of. So in Acts 12:25 with 
hupostrephd. With ablative case. See Rom. 7:12 for hagia 
applied to hé entolé (cf. I Tim. 6:14). II Peter strikes a 
high ethical note (1:¢ff.). Delivered (paradotheisés). First 
aorist passive participle feminine ablative singular of para- 
didomi. 

22. It has happened (sumbebéken). Perfect active indica- 
tive of sumbaind, for which see I Pet. 4:12. According to 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 171 


the true proverb (to tés aléthous paroimias). “The word (fo 
used absolutely, the matter of, as in Matt. 21:21; James 4:14) 
of the true proverb” (paroimia a wayside saying, for which 
see John 10:6; 16:25, 29). The first proverb here given 
comes from Prov. 26:11. Exerama is a late and rare word 
(here only in N.T., in Diosc. and Eustath.) from exerad, to 
vomit. The sow that had washed (his lousamené). His, old 
word for hog, here only in N.T. Participle first aorist direct 
middle of Joud shows that it is feminine (anarthrous). This 
second proverb does not occur in the O.T., probably from 
a Gentile source because about the habit of hogs. Epictetus 
and other writers moralize on the habit of hogs, having once _ 
bathed in a filthy mud-hole, to delight in it. To wallowing 
(eis kulismon). ‘To rolling.” Late and rare word (from 
kulio, Mark g:20), here only in N.T. In the mire (borborou). 
Objective genitive, old word for dung, mire, here only in 
N.T. J. Rendel Harris (Story of Ahikar, p. LXVII) tells 
of a story about a hog that went to the bath with people 
of quality, but on coming out saw a stinking drain and went 
and rolled himself in it. 


CHAPTER III 


1. Beloved (agapétoi). With this vocative verbal (four 
times in this chapter), Peter “turns away from the Libertines 
and their victims” (Mayor). This is now the second epistle 
that I write unto you (tauten édé deuteran humin grapho 
epistolén). Literally, “This already a second epistle I am 
writing to you.” For édé see John 21:24. It is the predicate 
use of deuteran epistolén in apposition with tautén, not “this 
second epistle.”” Reference apparently to I Peter. And in 
both of them (en hais). ‘In which epistles.” I stir up 
(diegeiro). Present active indicative, perhaps conative, “I 
try to stir up.” See 1:13. Mind (dianoian). Understand- 
ing (Plato) as in I Pet. 1:13. Sincere (eilikriné). Old ad- 
jective of doubtful etymology (supposed to be heilé, sun- 
light, and krind, to judge by it). Plato used it of ethical 
purity (psuché eilikrinés) as here and Phil. 1:10, the only 
N.T. examples. By putting you in remembrance (en hupo- 
mnései). As in 1:13. 

2. That ye should remember (mnésthénai). First aorist 
passive (deponent) infinitive of mimnéskd, to remind. Pur- 
pose (indirect command) is here expressed by this infinitive. 
Imperative in Jude 17. Spoken before (proeirémenén). Per- 
fect passive participle of proeipon (defective verb). Geni- 
tive case rématon after mnésthenai. And the commandment 
(kat tés entolés). Ablative case with hupo (agency). Of the 
Lord and Saviour through your apostles (ton apostolon humon 
tou kuriou kai sotéros). Humén (your) is correct, not hémon 
(our). But the several genitives complicate the sense. If 
dia (through) occurred before son apostolon, it would be 
clear. It is held by some that Peter would not thus speak 
of the twelve apostles, including himself, and that the forger 

172 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 173 


here allows the mask to slip, but Bigg rightly regards this 
a needless inference. The meaning is that they should re- 
member the teaching of their apostles and not follow the 
Gnostic libertines. 

3. Knowing this first (touto proton gindskontes). Present 
active participle of gindskd. See 1:20 for this identical 
phrase. Nominative absolute here where accusative ginds- 
kontas would be regular. Peter now takes up the parousta 
(1:16) after having discussed the dunamis of Christ. In 
the last days (ep’ eschaton ton hémerén). ‘‘Upon the last of 
the days.” Jude 18 has it ep’ eschatou chronou (upon the 
last time). In I Pet. 1:5 it is en kairdi eschatoi (in the last 
time), while I Pet. 1:20 has ep’ eschatou ton chronodn (upon 
the last of the times). John has usually s@i eschatéi hémerat 
(on the last day, 6:39f.). Here eschaton is a predicate ad- 
jective like summus mons (the top of the mountain). Mock- 
ers with mockery (empaigmonéi empaiktai). Note Peter's 
play on words again, both from empaizd (Matt. 2:16), to 
trifle with, and neither found elsewhere save empaiktés in 
Jude 18 and Is. 3:4 (playing like children). 

4. Where is the promise of his coming? (pou estin hé epag- 
gelia tés parousias autou;). This is the only sample of the 
questions raised by these mockers. Peter had mentioned 
this subject of the parousia in 1:16. Now he faces it squarely. 
Peter, like Paul (I Thess. 5:1f.; II Thess. 2:1f.), preached 
about the second coming (1:16; Acts 3:20f.), as Jesus him- 
self did repeatedly (Matt. 24:34) and as the angels promised 
at the Ascension (Acts 1:11). Both Jesus and Paul (II 
Thess. 2:1f.) were misunderstood on the subject of the time 
and the parables of Jesus urged readiness and forbade setting 
dates for his coming, though his language in Matt. 24:34 
probably led some to believe that he would certainly come 
while they were alive. From the day that (aph’ hes). “From 
which day.” See Luke 7:45. Fell asleep (ekoiméthésan). 
First aorist passive indicative of koimad, old verb, to put 


174 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


sleep, classic euphemism for death (John 11:11) like our 
cemetery (sleeping-place). Continue (diamenei). Present 
active indicative of diamend, to remain through (Luke 1:22). 
In statu quo. As they were (houtos). “Thus.” From the 
beginning of creation (ap’ arches ktiseds). Precisely so in 
Mark 10:6, which see. 

5. For this they wilfully forget (lanthanei gar autous touto 
thelontas). Literally, “for this escapes them being willing.” 
See this use of /anthand (old verb, to escape notice of, to be 
hidden from) in Acts 26:26. The present active participle 
thelontas (from theld, to wish) has almost an adverbial sense 
here. Compacted (sunestisa). See Paul’s sunestéken (Col. 
1:17) “consist.” Second perfect active (intransitive) par- 
ticiple of sunistémi, feminine singular agreeing with gé (near- 
est to it) rather than with ouranoi (subject of ésan imper- 
fect plural). There is no need to make Peter mean the 
Jewish mystical “‘seven heavens” because of the plural which 
was used interchangeably with the singular (Matt. 5:of.). 
Out of water and amidst water (ex hudatos kai di’ hudatos). 
Out of the primeval watery chaos (Gen. 1:2), but it is not 
plain what is meant by di’ Audatos, which naturally means 
“by means of water,” though dia with the genitive is used 
for a condition or state (Heb. 12:1). The reference may be 
to Gen. 1:9, the gathering together of the waters. By the 
word of God (toi tou theou logoi). Instrumental case logot, 
“by the fiat of God” (Gen. 1:3; Heb. 11:3 rémati theou). ; 

6. By which means (di’ hin). The two waters above or 
the water and the word of God. Mayor against the MSS. 
reads di’ hou (singular) and refers it to Jogéi alone. Being 
overflowed (kataklustheis). First aorist passive participle of 
katakluzd, old compound, here only in N.T., but see kata- 
klusmos in 2:5. With water (hudati). Instrumental case of 
hudor. Perished (apileto). Second aorist middle indicative 
of apollumi. 

7. That now are (nun). “The now heavens” over against 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 175 


“the then world” (ho tote kosmos verse 6). By the same-word 
(toi autoi logoi). Instrumental case again referring to Jogot 
in verse 6. Have been stored up (tethésaurismenoi eisin). 
Perfect passive indicative of ¢hésaurizd, for which verb see 
Matt. 6:19; Luke 12:21. For fire (puri). Dative case of 
pur, not with fire (instrumental case). The destruction of 
the world by fire is here pictured as in Joel 2:30f.; Ps. 50:3. 
Being reserved (téroumenoi). Present passive participle of 
tered, for which see 2:4. Against (eis). Unto. As in 2:4, 9 
and see I Pet. 1:4 for the inheritance reserved for the saints 
of God. 

8. Forget not this one thing (hen touto mé lanthanetd humas). 
Rather, “‘let not this one thing escape you.” For Janthaneto 
(present active imperative of /anthand) see verse 5. The 
“one thing” (hen) is explained by the Aoti (that) clause 
following. Peter applies the language of Ps. 89 (g0):4 about 
the eternity of God and shortness of human life to “the 
impatience of human expectations” (Bigg) about the second 
coming of Christ. ‘“‘The day of judgment is at hand (I Pet. 
4:7). It may come tomorrow; but what is tomorrow? 
What does God mean by a day? It may be a thousand 
years” (Bigg). Precisely the same argument applies to those 
who argue for a literal interpretation of the thousand years 
in Rev. 20:4-6. It may be a day or a day may be a thou- 
sand years. God’s clock (para kuridi, beside the Lord) does 
not run by our timepieces. The scoffers scoff ignorantly. 

g. Is not slack concerning his promise (ou bradunei tes 
epaggelias). Ablative case epaggelias after bradunei (pres- 
ent active indicative of bradund, from bradus, slow), old verb, 
to be slow in, to fall short of (like /eipetai sophias in James 
1:5), here and I Tim. 3:15 only in N.T. Slackness (bradu- 
téta). Old substantive from bradus (James 1:19), here only 
in N.T. God is not impotent nor unwilling to execute his 
promise. To youward (eis humas). Pros rather than eis 
after makrothumei in I Thess. 5:14 and epi in James 5:7, 


176 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


etc. Not wishing (mé boulomenos). Present middle par- 
ticiple of doulomai. Some will perish (verse 7), but that is 
not God’s desire. Any (tinas). Rather than “some” (tines) 
above. Accusative with the infinitive apolesthai (second 
aorist middle of apollumi. God wishes “all” (pantas) to 
come (chérésai first aorist active infinitive of chéred, old 
verb, to make room). See Acts 17:30; Rom. 11:32; I Tim. 
2:4; Heb. 2:9 for God’s provision of grace for all who will 
repent. 

10. The day of the Lord (hémera kuriou). So Peter in Acts 
2:20 (from Joel 3:4) and Paul in I Thess. 5:2, 4; II Thess. 
2:2; I Cor. 5:5; and day of Christ in Phil. 2:16 and day of 
God in 2:12 and day of judgment already in 2:9; 3:7. This 
great day will certainly come (Aéxei). Future active of 
héko, old verb, to arrive, but in God’s own time. As a thief 
(hos kleptes). That is suddenly, without notice. This very 
metaphor Jesus had used (Luke 12:39; Matt. 24:43) and 
Paul after him (I Thess. 5:2) and John will quote it also 
(Rev. 3:3; 16:15). In the which (en héi). The day when 
the Lord comes. Shall pass away (pareleusontai). Future 
middle of parerchomai, old verb, to pass by. With a great 
notse (roizedon). Late and rare adverb (from roized, roizos)— 
Lycophron, Nicander, here only in N.T., onomatopoetic, 
whizzing sound of rapid motion through the air like the 
flight of a bird, thunder, fierce flame. The elements (ta 
stoicheia). Old word (from stoichos a row), in Plato in this 
sense, in other senses also in N.T. as the alphabet, cere- 
monial regulations (Heb. 5:12; Gal. 4:3; 5:1; Col. 2:8). 
Shall be dissolved (luthésetai). Future passive of Jué, to 
loosen, singular because stoicheia is neuter plural. With 
fervent heat (kausoumena). Present passive participle of 
kausod, late verb (from kausos, usually medical term for 
fever) and nearly always employed for fever temperature. 
Mayor suggests a conflagration from internal heat. Bigg 
thinks it merely a vernacular (Doric) future for kausomena 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 177 


(from kaid, to burn). Shall be burned. up (katakaésetat). 
Repeated in verse 12. Second future passive of the com- 
pound verb katakaid, to burn down (up), according to A L. 
But Aleph B K P read heurethésetai (future passive of 
heurisk@, to find) “shall be found.” There are various other 
readings here. The text seems corrupt. 

11. To be dissolved (luomenon). Present passive participle 
(genitive absolute with toutdn panton, these things all) of 
Jud, either the futuristic present or the process of dissolution 
presented. What manner of persons (potapous). Late quali- 
tative interrogative pronoun for the older podapos as in 
Matt. 8:27, accusative case with dei huparchein agreeing 
with humds (you). See 1:8 for huparchd. In all holy living 
and godliness (en hagiais anastrophais kai eusebeiais). “In 
holy behaviours and pieties” (Alford). Plural of neither 
word elsewhere in N.T., but a practical plural in pasa 
anastrophé in I Pet. 1:15. 

12. Looking for (prosdokéntas). Present active participle 
of prosdokad (Matt. 11:3) agreeing in case (accusative plural) 
with Aumas. Earnestly desiring (speudontas). Present ac. 
tive participle, accusative also, of speuddo, old verb, to hasten 
(like our speed) as in Luke 2:16, but it is sometimes transi- 
tive as here either (preferably so) to “hasten on the parou- 
sia” by holy living (cf. I Pet. 2:12), with which idea com- 
pare Matt. 6:10 and Acts 3:19f., or to desire earnestly (Is. 
16:5). Being on fire (puroumenoi). Present passive par- 
ticiple of purod, old verb (from pur), same idea as in verse 
10. Shall melt (teketai). Futuristic present passive indica- 
tive of #2kd, old verb, to make liquid, here only in N.T. 
Hort suggests éxetai (future middle), though Is. 34:4 has 
takésontai (second future passive). The repetitions here 
make “an effective refrain” (Mayor). 

13. Promise (epaggelma). As in 1:4. The reference 1s to 
Is. 65:17f.; 66:22. See also Rev. 21:1. For kainos (new) 
see on Matt. 26:29. For the expectant attitude in pros- 


178 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


dokomen (we look for) repeated from verse 12 and again in 
verse 14, see apekdechometha (we eagerly look for) in Phil. 
3:20.. Wherein (en hois). The new heavens and earth. 
Dwelleth (katoikei). Has its home (oikos). Certainly “right- 
eousness” (dikaiosuné) is not at home in this present world 
either in individuals, families, or nations. 

14. Wherefore (dio). Asin 1:10, 12. Give diligence (spou- 
dasate). As in 1:10. That ye may be found (heurethénai). 
First aorist passive infinitive (cf. heurethésetai in verse 10). 
For this use of heuriskd about the end see II Cor. 5:3; Phil. 
3:9; I Pet. 1:7. Without spot and blameless (aspiloi kai 
amométot). Predicate nominative after heurethénai. See 
2:13 for position words spiloi kai momoi and I Pet. 1:19 for 
amomos (so Jude 24) kai aspilos (so James 1:27). Amodmétos 
(old verbal of mémaomai) only here in N.T. save some MSS. 
in Phil. 2:15. 

15. In his sight (autéi). Ethical dative. Referring to 
Christ. Js salvation (sétérian). Predicate accusative after 
hégeisthe in apposition with makrothumian (long-suffering), 
an opportunity for repentance (cf. I Pet. 3:20). The Lord 
here is Christ. Our beloved brother Paul (ho agapétos adelphos 
Paulos). Paul applies the verbal agapétos (beloved) to 
Epaphras (Col. 1:7), Onesimus (Col. 4:9; Philem. 16), to 
Tychicus (Col. 4:7; Eph. 6:21), and to four brethren in 
Rom. 16 (Epainetus 5, Ampliatus 8, Stachys 9, Persis 12). 
It is not surprising for Peter to use it of Paul in view of 
Gal. 2:9f., in spite of Gal, 2:11-14. Given to him (dotheisan 
autot). First aorist passive participle of diddmi with dative 
case. Peter claimed wisdom for himself, but recognises 
that Paul had the gift also. His language here may have 
caution in it as well as commendation. “St. Peter speaks 
of him with affection and respect, yet maintains the right 
to criticise” (Bigg). 

16. 4s also in all his epistles (hos kai en pasais epistolais). 
We do not know to how many Peter here refers. There is 


THE SECOND EPISTLE OF PETER 179 


no difficulty in supposing that Peter “received every one of 
St. Paul’s Epistles within a month or two of its publication” 
(Bigg). And yet Peter does not here assert the formation 
of a canon of Paul’s Epistles. Speaking in them of these 
things (Jalon en autais peri touton). Present active participle 
of /aled. That is to say, Paul also wrote about the second 
coming of Christ, as is obviously true. Hard to be under- 
stood (dusnoéta). Late verbal from dus and-noeé (in Aris- 
totle, Lucian, Diog. Laert.), here only in N.T. We know 
that the Thessalonians persisted in misrepresenting Paul.on 
this very subject of the second coming as Hymenaeus and 
Philetus did about the resurrection (II Tim. 2:17) and Spitta 
holds that Paul’s teaching about grace was twisted to mean ~ 
moral laxity like Gal. 3:10; Rom. 3:20, 28; 5:20 (with which 
cf. 6:1 as a case in point), etc. Peter does not say that he 
himself did not understand Paul on the subject of.faith and 
freedom. Unlearned (amatheis).. Old word (alpha privative 
and manthané to learn), ignorant, here only in N.T. Un- 
steadfast (asteriktoi). See on 2:14. Wrest (streblousin). Pres- 
ent active indicative of streblod, old verb (from stredlos 
twisted, strephd, to turn), here only in N.T. The other scrip- 
tures (tas loipas graphas). There is no doubt that the 
apostles claimed to speak by the help of the Holy Spirit 
(I Thess. 5:27; Col. 4:16) just as the prophets of old did 
(II Pet. 1:20f.). Note Joipas (rest) here rather than allas 
(other). Peter thus puts Paul’s Epistles on the same plane 
with the O.T., which was also misused (Matt. 5:21—-44; 
16:3-6; 19:3-10). 

17. Knowing these things beforehand (progindskontes). Pres- 
ent active participle of progindsko as in I Pet. 1:20. CE 
proton gindsko (1:20; 3:1). Hence they are without excuse 
for misunderstanding Peter or Paul on this subject. Be- 
ware (phulassesthe). Present middle imperative of phulasso, 
common verb, to guard. Lest (hina mé). Negative purpose, 
“that not.” Being carried away (sunapachthentes). First 


18 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


aorist passive participle of sunapagod, old verb double com- 
pound, to carry away together with, in N.T. only here and 
Gal. 2:13. With the error (téi planéi). Instrumental case, 
“by the error” (the wandering). Of the wicked (tin athes- 
mon). See on 2:7. Ye fall from (ekpeséte). Second aorist 
active subjunctive with hina mé of ekpipta, old verb, to fall 
out of, with the ablative here (stérigmou, steadfastness, late 
word from stérizd, here alone in N.T.) as in Gal. 5:4. (tés 
charitos exepesate, ye fell out of grace). 

18. But grow (auxanete de). Present active imperative of 
auxano, in contrast with such a fate pictured in verse 17, 
“but keep on growing.” In the grace and knowledge (en 
chariti kat gnosei). Locative case with en. Grow in both. 
Keep it up. See on 1:1 for the idiomatic use of the single 
article (tou) here, “of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.” 
To him (autoi). To Christ. For ever (eis hémeran aionos). 
“Unto the day of eternity.” So Sirach 18:9f. One of the 
various ways of expressing eternity by the use of aién. So 
ets ton aiona in John 6:6; 12:34.

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


THE AUTHOR 


He calls himself Judas, but this was a very common name. 
In the N.T. itself we have Judas Iscariot and Judas not 
Iscariot (John 14:22; also called Judas of James, son or 
brother, Luke 6:6), Judas a brother of our Lord (Matt. 
13:55), Judas of Galilee (Acts 5:37), Judas of Damascus 
(Acts 9:11), Judas Barsabbas (Acts 15:22). The author ex-. 
plains that he is a “slave” of Jesus Christ as James did 
(1:1), and adds that he is also a brother of James. Clement 
of Alexandria thinks that, like James, he deprecated being 
called the brother of the Lord Jesus (as by Hegesippus later) 
as claiming too much authority. Keil identifies him with 
Jude the Apostle (not Iscariot), but that is most unlikely. 
The Epistle is one of the disputed books of Eusebius. It 
was recognized in the canon in the Third Council of Carthage 
(a.D. 397). It appears in the Muratorian Canon (a.D. 170). 


Tue Revation To II PETER 


Beyond a doubt one of these Epistles was used by the 
other, as one can see by comparing particularly Jude 3-18 
and II Peter 2:1-18. As already said concerning II Peter, 
scholars are greatly divided on this point, and in our present 
state of knowledge it does not seem possible to reach a solid 
conclusion. The probability is that not much time elapsed 
between them. Mayor devotes a whole chapter to the dis- 
cussion of the relation between II Peter and Jude and reaches 
the conclusion “that in Jude we have the first thought, in 
Peter the second thought.” That is my own feeling, but it 


is all so subjective that I have no desire to urge the point 
183 


i84 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


unduly. Bigg is equally positive that II Peter comes before 
Jude. 


Tue Use or ApocrypHaL Books 


Jude (verse 14) quotes from “Enoch” by name and says 
that he “‘prophesied.” What he quotes is a combination of 
various passages in the Book of Enoch as we have it now. 
It used to be held that part of Enoch was later than Jude, 
but Charles seems to have disproved that, though the book 
as we have it has many interpolations. Tertullian wanted 
to canonise Enoch because of what Jude says, whereas 
Chrysostom says that the authenticity of Jude was doubted 
because of the use of Enoch. In verse 9 there seems to be 
an allusion to the Assumption of Moses, another apocryphal 
book, but it is the use of “prophesied” in verse 14 about 
Enoch that gave most offence. It is possible, of course, 
that Jude did not attach the full sense to that term. 


THE STYLE 


It is terse and picturesque, with a fondness for triplets. 
The use of the O.T. is very much like that in II Peter. 
Alford notes that it is impassioned invective with epithet on 
epithet, image on image. Bigg remarks on the stern and 
unbending nature of the author, with no pathos and a harsh 
view of things and with frequent use of Pauline phraseology. 
There are some fifteen words not in the rest of the N.T. 
The grammar is less irregular than that of II Peter. There 
is often a poetic ring in his words. 


Tue Purpose 


The author undoubtedly has the Gnostics in mind and is 
seeking to warn his readers against them, as is true of II 
Peter. This same purpose appears in the Johannine Epistles, 
as was true also of Colossians, Ephesians, the Pastoral 


Epistles, 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 185 


THe READERS 


Of this we know nothing at all. Dr. Chase believes that 
the Epistle was sent to Antioch in Syria. That may be true, 
though it is mere conjecture. Any place or places in Asia 
Minor would suit so far as we know. The readers were 
probably both Jewish and Gentile Christians. Jerusalem 
and Alexandria are urged as the place of composition, but 
of that we have no real information. 


THe Date 


This really turns on the genuineness of the Epistle. Ther 
is no clear indication of the date, for the Gnostics describec 
can belong to the first or to the second century. If it wa 
used by II Peter, that would place it slightly before tha’ 
Epistle. The date suggested, 65 to 67 A.D., is purely cot.

1. Servant (doulos). Precisely as James (1:1), only James 
added kuriou (Lord). Brother of ‘fames (adelphos Iakobou). 
Thus Jude identifies himself. But not the “Judas of James” 
(Luke 6:16; Acts 1:13). To them that are called (tois—klétois). 
But this translation (treating k/étois as a substantive like 
Rom. 1:6; I Cor. 1:24) is by no means certain as two parti- 
ciples come in between fois and klétois. Kiétois may be in 
the predicate position (being called), not attributive. But 
see I Pet. 1:1. Beloved in God the Father (en thedi patri 
egapemenots). Perfect passive participle of agapad, but no 
precise parallel to this use of en with agapad. Kept for Fesus 
Christ (Lésou Christoi tetévémenois). Perfect passive parti- 
ciple again with dative, unless it is the instrumental, “kept 
by Jesus Christ,” a quite possible interpretation. 

2. Be multiplied (plethuntheié). First aorist passive opta- 
tive of pléthuné as in I Pet. 1:2 and II Pet. 1:2. 

3. Beloved (agapetoi). As in III John 2. All diligence 
(pasan spouden). As in II Pet. 1:5. Of our common salva- 
tion (peri tés koinés hémon sotérias). See this use of koinos 
(common to all) in Titus 1:4 with pistis, while in II Pet. 1:1 
we have isotimon pistin, which see. I was constrained 
(anagkén eschon). “I had necessity” like Luke 14:18; Heb. 
7:27. To contend earnestly (epagonizesthai). Late and rare 
(in Plutarch, inscriptions) compound, here only in N.T. A 
little additional (epi) striving to the already strong agoni- 
xesthat (agon contest). Cf. I Tim. 6:12 agénizou ton kalon 
agona. For the faith (tei—pistei). Dative of advantage. 
Here not in the original sense of trust, but rather of the 
thing believed as in verse 20 and in Gal. 1:23; 3:23; Phil. 
1:27. Once for all delivered (hapax paradotheiséi). First 

186 


THE EPISTLE OF JUDE 187 


aorist passive participle feminine dative singular of paradi- 
domi, for which see II Pet. 2:21. See also II Thess. 2:15; 
I Cor. 11:2; I Tim. 6:20. 

4. Are crept in (pareiseduésan). Second aorist passive in- 
dicative of pareisdué (-nd), late (Hippocrates, Plutarch, etc.) 
compound of para (beside) and eis (in) and dud to sink or 
plunge, so to slip in secretly as if by a side door, here only 
in N.T. Set forth (progegrammenoi). Perfect passive parti- 
ciple of prographd, to write of beforehand, for which verb 
see Gal. 3:1; Rom. 15:4. Unto this condemnation (eis touto 
to krima). See II Pet. 2:3 for krima and ekpalai. Palai 
here apparently alludes to verses 14 and 15 (Enoch). Un- 
godly men (asebeis). Keynote of the Epistle (Mayor), in 15 
again as in IJ Pet. 2:5; 3:7. Turning (metatithentes). Pres- 
ent active participle of metatithémi, to change, for which verb 
see Gal. 1:6. For the change of “grace” (charita) into “‘las- 
civiousness (eis aselgeian) see I Pet. 2:16; 4:3; II Pet. 2:19; 
3:16. Our only Master and Lord (ton monon despotén kai 
kurion hemon). For the force of the one article for one 
person see on II Pet. 1:1. For despoten of Christ see II Pet. 
2:1. Denying (arnoumenot). So II Pet. 2:1. See also Matt. 
aSieopbolini.5285 Titusia:16;/b John 2:22. 

5. To put you in remembrance (hupomnésai). See II Pet. 
1:12 hupomimnéskein (present active infinitive there, first 
aorist active infinitive here). Though ye know all things once 
for all (eidotas hapax panta). Concessive perfect (sense of 
present) active participle as in II Pet. 1:12, but without 
kaiper. The Lord (kurios). Some MSS. add Jésous. The 
use of kurios here is usually understood to mean the Lord 
Jesus Christ, as Clement of Alex. (4dumbér. p. 133) explains, 
Ex. 23:20, by ho mustikos ekeinos aggelos Iésous (that mys- 
tical angel Jesus). For the mystic reference to Christ see 
I Cor. 10:4, 9; Heb. 11:26. Some MSS. here add ¢heos in- 
stead of [ésous. Afterward (to deuteron). Adverbial accusa- 
tive, “‘the second time.” After having saved the people out

of Egypt. Destroyed (apolesen). First aorist active indicative 
of apollumi, old verb, todestroy. Them that believed not (tous 
mé pisteusantas). First aorist active articular participle of 
pisteud. The reference is to Numb. 14:27-37, when all the 
people rescued from Egypt perished except Caleb and Joshua. 
This first example by Jude is not in II Peter, but is discussed 
inal: Corl rers=117Hebiy 1184422. 

6. And angels (aggelous de). ‘The second example in Jude, 
the fallen angels, accusative case after teteréken (perfect 
active indicative of féred, for which verb see II Pet. 2:4, 7) 
at the end of the verse (two emphatic positions, beginning 
and end of the clause). Kept not (mé térésantas). First 
aorist active participle with negative mé, with play on “kept 
not” and “he hath kept.” Principality (archén). Literally, 
“beginning,” “rule,” (first place of power as in I Cor. 15:24; 
Rom. 8:38). In Acts 1o:11 it is used for ‘“‘corners” (begin- 
nings) of the sheet. In Eph. 6:12 the word is used for evil 
angels. See Deut. 32:8. Both Enoch and Philo (and Milton) 
discuss the fallen angels. But left (alla apolipontas). Second 
aorist active participle of apoleipd, old verb, to leave behind 
(II Tim. 4:13, 20). Their own proper habitation (to idion 
oikétérion). Old word for dwelling-place (from oikétér, dweller 
at home, from okos), in N.T. only here and II Cor. 5:2 (the 
body as the abode of the spirit). In everlasting bonds (desmois 
aidiois). Either locative (in) or instrumental (by, with). 
Aidios (from aei, always), old adjective, in N.T. only here 
and Rom. 1:20 (of God’s power and deity). It is synonymous 
with aidnios (Matt. 25:46). Mayor terms aidios an Aristo- 
telian word, while aidnios is Platonic. Under darkness (hupo 
zophon). See II Pet. 2:4 for zophos. In Wisd. 17:2 we find 
desmioi skotous (prisoners of darkness). Great (megaleés). 
Not in II Pet. 2:9, which see for discussion. 

7. Even as (hos). Just “as.” The third instance (Jude 
passes by the deluge) in Jude, the cities of the plain. The 
cities about them (hai peri autas poleis). These were also

included, Admah and Zeboiim (Deut. 29:23; Hos. 11:8). 
Zoar, the other city, was spared. In like manner (ton 
homoion tropon). Adverbial accusative (cf. hds). Like the 
fallen angels. Having given themselves over to fornication 
(ekporneusasai). First aorist active participle feminine plu- 
ral of ekporneud, late and rare compound (perfective use of 
ek, outside the moral law), only here in N.T., but in LXX 
(Gen. 38:24; Ex. 34:15f., etc.). Cf. aselgeian in verse 4. 
Strange flesh (sarkos heteras). Worrible licentiousness, not 
simply with women not their wives or in other nations, but 
even unnatural uses (Rom. 1:27) for which the very word 
“sodomy” is used (Gen. I9:4-11). The pronoun heteras. 
(other, strange) is not in II Pet. 2:10. Are set forth (pro- 
keintai). Present middle indicative of prokeimai, old verb, 
to lie before, as in Heb. 12:1f. 4s an example (deigma). 
Predicate nominative of deigma, old word (from deiknumi 
to show), here only in N.T., sample, specimen. II Pet. 2:6 
has hupodeigma (pattern). Suffering (hupechousai). Present 
active participle of hupechd, old compound, to hold under, 
often with dikén (right, justice, sentence II Thess. 1:9) to 
suffer sentence (punishment), here only in N.T. Of eternal 
fire (puros aidniou). Like desmois aidiois in verse 7. Cf. 
the hell of fire (Matt. 5:22) and also Matt. 25:46. Jude has 
no mention of Lot. 

8. Yet (mentoi). See John 4:27. In spite of these warn- 
ings. In like manner (homoids). Like the cities of the plain. 
These also (kai houtoi). The false teachers of verse 4. In 
their dreamings (enupniazomenoi). Present middle participle

Plutarch, papyri, LXX (Joel 2:28), here only in N.T. Cf. 
Col. 2:18. Defile (miainousin). Present active indicative 
of minaind, old verb, to stain, with sin (Titus 1:15) as here. 
II Pet. 2:10 has miasmou. Set at nought (athetousin). Pres- 
ent active indicative of atheted, to annul. Both. kuriotes. 


190 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(dominion) and dowxai (dignities) occur in II Pet. 2:10, which 
see for discussion. 

g. Michael the archangel (ho Michaél ho archaggelos). Mi- 
chael is mentioned also in Dan. 10:13, 21; 12:1; Rev. 12:7. 
Archaggelos in N.T. occurs only here and I Thess. 4:16, but 
in Dan. 10:13, 20; 12:1. Contending with the devil (toi 
diaboloi diakrinomenos). Present middle participle of dia- 
krino, to separate, to strive with as in Acts 11:2. Dative case 
diabolot. When he disputed (hote dielegeto). Imperfect middle 
of dialegomai as in Mark 9:34. Concerning the body of Moses 
(peri tou Mouseos sdmatos). Some refer this to Zech. 3:1, 
others to a rabbinical comment on Deut. 34:6. There is a 
similar reference to traditions in Acts 7:22; Gal. 3:19; Heb. 
2:2; II Tim. 3:8. But this explanation hardly meets the 
facts. Durst not bring (ouk etolmesen epenegkein). “‘Did not 
dare (first aorist active indicative of to/mao), to bring against 
him” (second aorist active infinitive of epipherd). A railing 
accusation (krisin blasphemias). “Charge of blasphemy” 
where II Pet. 2:11 has “‘dlasphémon krisin.” Peter also has 
para kurioi (with the Lord), not in Jude. The Lord rebuke 
thee (epitimésai soi kurios). First aorist active optative of 
epitimad, a wish about the future. These words occur in 
Zech. 3:1-10 where the angel of the Lord replies to the 
charges of Satan. Clement of Alex. (4dumb. in Ep. Fudae) 
says that Jude quoted here the Assumption of Moses, one 
of the apocryphal books. Origen says the same thing. 
Mayor thinks that the author of the Assumption of Moses 
took these words from Zechariah and put them in the mouth 
of the Archangel Michael. There is a Latin version of the 
Assumption. Some date it as early as B.c. 2, others after 
A.D. 44. 

10. Whatsoever things they know not (hosa ouk oidasin). 
Here II Pet. 2:12 has en hois agnoousin. The rest of the 
sentence is smoother than II Pet. 2:12. Naturally (phusikds). 
Here only in N.T. II Pet. 2:12 has gegennémena phusika. 


THE EPISTLE OF JUDE 191 


Jude has the article ¢a with aloga z0a and the present passive 
phtheirontai instead of the future passive phtharésontai. 

11. Woe to them (ouai autois). Interjection with the dative 
as is common in the Gospels (Matt. 11:21). Went (eporeu- 
thésan). First aorist passive (deponent) indicative of po- 
reuomat. In the way of Cain (téi hodoi tou Kain). Locative 
case hoddi. Cain is Jude’s-fourth example. Not in II Peter, 
but in Heb. 11:4; I John 3:11f. From Gen. 4:7. Ran riot- 
ously (exechuthésan). First aorist passive indicative of ekched, 
to pour out, “‘they were poured out,” vigorous metaphor for 
excessive indulgence. But it is used also of God’s love for 
us (Rom. 5:5). J the error of Balaam (téi planéi tou Balaam). 
The fifth example in Jude. In II Peter also (2:15). Either 
locative case (in) or instrumental (by). Plané (in Peter 
also) is the common word for such wandering (Matt. 24:4ff., 
etc.). Perished (apolonto). Second aorist middle (intransi- 
tive) of apollumi. In the gainsaying of Korah (tei antilogiai 
tou Kore). Again either locative or instrumental. The word 
antilogia is originally answering back (Heb. 6:16), but it 
may be by act also (Rom. 10:21) as here. This is the sixth 
example in Jude, not in II Peter. 

12. Hidden rocks (spilades). Old word for rocks in the 
sea (covered by the water), as in Homer, here only in N.T. 
II Pet. 2:13 has spiloi. Love-feasts (agapais). Undoubtedly 
the correct text here, though A C have apatais as in II Pet. 
2:14. For disorder at the Lord’s Supper (and love-feasts?) 
see I Cor. 11:17-34. The Gnostics made it worse, so that 
the love-feasts were discontinued. When they feast with you 
(suneuochoumenoi). See II Pet. 2:13 for this very word and 
form. Masculine gender with houtoi hoi rather than with 
the feminine spilades. Cf. Rev. 11:4. Construction accord- 
ing to sense. Shepherds that feed themselves (heautous pot- 
mainontes). ‘‘Shepherding themselves.” Cf. Rev. 7:17 for 
this use of poimaind. Clouds without water (nephelai anu- 
droi). Nephelé common word for cloud (Matt. 24:30). I 


192 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Pet. 2:17 has pégai anudroi (springs without water) and then 
homichlai (mists) and elaunomenai (driven) rather than 
peripheromenai here (borne around, whirled around, present 
passive participle of peripherd to bear around), a powerful 
picture of disappointed hopes. Autumn trees (dendra phthino- 
porina). Late adjective (Aristotle, Polybius, Strabo) from 
phthinod, to waste away, and opéra, autumn, here only in 
N.T. For akarpa (without fruit) see II Pet. 1:8. Twice 
dead (dis apothanonta). Second aorist active participle of 
apothnésko. Fruitless and having died. Having died and 
also “uprooted” (ekrizothenta). First aorist passive par- 
ticiple of ekrizod, late compound, to root out, to pluck up 
by the roots, as in Matt. 13:29. 

13. Wild waves (kumata agria). Waves (Matt. 8:24, from 
kued, to swell) wild (from agros, field, wild honey Matt. 
3:4) like untamed animals of the forest or the sea. Foaming 
out (epaphrizonta). Late and rare present active participle 
of epaphrizo, used in Moschus for the foaming waves as 
here. Cf. Is. 57:20. Shame (aischunas). Plural “shames” 
(disgraces). Cf. Phil. 3:19. Wandering stars (asteres plan- 
étai). “Stars wanderers.” Planétés, old word (from planad), 
here alone in N.T. Some refer this to comets or shooting 
stars. See Is. 14:12 for an allusion to Babylon as the day- 
star who fell through pride. For ever (eis aidna). The rest 
of the relative clause exactly as in II Pet. 2:17. 

14. And to these also (de kai toutois). Dative case, for 
these false teachers as well as for his contemporaries. Enoch 
the seventh from Adam (hebdomos apo Adam Henich). The 
genealogical order occurs in Gen. 5:4-20, with Enoch as 
seventh. He is so termed in Enoch 60:8; 93:3. Prophesied 
(eprophéteusen). First aorist active indicative of prophéteud. 
If the word is given its ordinary meaning as in I Pet. 1:10, 
then Jude terms the Book of Enoch an inspired book. The 
words quoted are “‘a combination of passages from Enoch” 
(Bigg), chiefly from Enoch 1:9. With ten thousand of his 


THE EPISTLE OF JUDE 193 


holy ones (en hagiais muriasin autou). “With (en of ac- 
companiment, Luke 14:31) his holy ten thousands” (murias 
regular word, feminine gender, for ten thousand, Acts 19:19, 
there an unlimited number like our myriads, Luke 12:1). 

15. To execute judgment (poiésai krisin). ‘‘To do justice.” 
To convict (elegxai). ‘First aorist (effective) active infinitive 
like poiésai before it. Ungodly (asebeis). See verse 4 and 
end of this verse. Of ungodliness (asebeias). Old word as 
in Rom. 1:18, plural in Jude 18 as in Rom. 11:26. Which 
(hon). Genitive by attraction from ha (cognate accusative 
with @sebésan, old verb, to act impiously, here alone in 
N.T. save some MSS. in II Pet. 2:6) to agree with the ante- 
cedent ergén (deeds). Hard things (skléron). Harsh, rough” 
things as in John 6:60. Which (hon). Genitive by attrac- 
tion from ha (object of e/alésan, first aorist active indicative 
of Jaleo) to the case of the antecedent sk/érén. Four times 
in this verse as a sort of refrain asebeis (twice), asebeias, 
ésebésan. 

16. Murmurers (goggustai). Late onomatopoetic word for 
agent, from gogguzd (Matt. 20:11; I Cor. 10:10) in the LXX 
(Ex. 16:8; Numb. 11:1, 14-29). Complainers (mempsimot- 
roi). Rare word (Isocrates, Aristotle, Plutarch) from mem- 
phomai to complain and moira lot or fate. Here alone in 
N.T. Lusts (epithumias). As in II Pet. 3:3. Swelling 
(huperogka). So in II Pet. 2:18 (big words). Showing re- 
spect of persons (thaumazontes prosopa). Present active par- 
ticiple of thaumazd to admire, to wonder at. Nowhere else 
in N.T. with prosdpa, but a Hebraism (in Lev. 19:15; Job 
13:10) like lambanein prosépon (Luke 20:21) and blepein 
prosipon (Matt. 22:16) and prosopédlempted (James 2:9). Cf. 
James 2:1. For the sake of advantage (opheleias charin). 
To themselves. See also verse 11. The covetousness of these 
Gnostic leaders is plainly shown in II Pet. 2:3, 14. For 
charin as preposition with genitive see Eph. 3:1, 14. 

17. Remember ye (humeis mnésthéte). First aorist passive 


194 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(deponent) imperative of mimnesko with genitive rématon 
(words). In II Pet. 3:2 we have the indirect form (infini- 
tive mnésthénai). The rest as in II Peter, but in simpler and 
more exact structure and with the absence of ton hagion 
prophéton (the holy prophets). 

18. How that (hoti). Declarative hoti as in verse 5. See 
discussion of II Pet. 3:3 for differences, no en empaigmonéi 
here and no ¢6n asebeion there. 

19. They who make separations (hoi apodiorizontes). Pres- 
ent active articular participle of the double compound 
apodiorizo (from apo, dia, horizo, horos, boundary, to make 
a horizon), rare word, in Aristotle for making logical dis- 
tinctions, here only in N.T. Diorizd occurs in Lev. 20:24 
and aphorizo in Matt. 25:32, etc. See Aaireseis in II Pet. 
2:1. Sensual (psuchikoi). Old adjective from psuché as in 
I Cor. 2:14; 15:44; James 3:15. Opposed to pueumatikos. 
Not used by Peter. Having not the Spirit (pneuma mé 
echontes). Usual negative mé with the participle (present 
active of echd). Probably pueuma here means the Holy 
Spirit, as is plain in verse 20. Cf. Rom. 8:9. 

20. Building up (epoikodomountes). Present active par- 
ticiple of epoikodomed, old compound with metaphor of a 
house (oikos), common in Paul (I Cor. 3:9-17; Col. 2:7; 
Eph. 2:20). On your most holy faith (tei hagidtatei humén 
pistei). For the spiritual temple see also I Pet. 2:3-5. See 
pistis (faith) in this sense (cf. Heb. 11:1) in II Pet. 1:5 with 
the list of graces added. A true superlative here hagidtatéi, 
not elative. Praying in the Holy Spirit (en pneumati hagidi 
proseuchomenoi). This is the way to build themselves up 
on iit faith. 

1. Keep yourselves (heautous sirsate): First aorist ac- 
tive ibipeeatins (of urgency) of #éred. In verse 1 they are 
said to be kept, but note the warning in verse 5 from the 
angels who did not keep their dominion. See also James 
1:27. In Phil. 2:12 both sides (human responsibility and 


THE EPISTLE OF JUDE 195 


divine sovereignty are presented side by side). Looking for 
(prosdechomenoi). Present middle participle of prosdecho- 
mai, the very form in Titus 2:13. The same idea in pros- 
dokontes in II Pet. 3:14. ; 

22. And on some (kai hous men). Demonstrative plural 
of hos men—hos de (hous de, below), not the relative hous, 
but by contrast (men, de). So Matt. 13:8. Have mercy 
(eleate). Present active imperative of e/ead (rare form in 
Rom. 9:16 also for the usual e/eed Matt. 9:27). But A C 
read elegchete, refute, in place of eledte. The text of this 
verse is in much confusion. Who are in doubt (diakrino- 
menous). Present middle participle of diakrind, in the ac- 
cusative case agreeing with hous men, though K L P have 
the nominative. If the accusative and eleate is read, see 
James 1:6 for the idea (doubters). If elegchete is read, see 
Jude 9 for the idea (disputers). 

23. And some save (hous de sozete). B omits hous de. 
Snatching them out of the fire (ek puros harpazontes). Present 
active participle of harpazd, old verb, to seize. Quotation 
from Amos 4:11 and Zech. 3:3. Cf. Ps. 106:18. Firemen 
today literally do this rescue work. Do Christians? And~ 
on some have mercy with fear (hous de eleate en phoboi). In 
fear “of the contagion of sin while we are rescuing them” 
(Vincent). For this idea see I Pet. 1:17; 3:15; II Cor. 7:1; 
Phil. 2:12. Spotted (espilomenon). Perfect passive par- 
ticiple of spilod, late and common verb (from spilos, spot, 
II Pet. 2:13), in N.T. only here and James 3:6. 

24. From stumbling (aptaistous). Verbal from ptaid, to 
stumble (James 3:2; II Pet. 1:10), sure-footed as of a 
horse that does not stumble (Xenophon), and so of a good 
man (Epictetus, Marcus Antoninus). Before the presence of 
his glory (katendpion tés doxés autou). Late compound prep- 
osition (kata, en, Ops), right down before the eye of his glory 
as in Eph. 1:4. Cf. Matt. 25:31-33; Col. 1:22, where Paul 
has parastesai like stésai here (first aorist active infinitive) 


196 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


and also amomous as here, but amémétos in II Pet. 3:14. 
In exceeding joy (en agalliasei). See Luke 1:14. 

25. To the only God our Saviour (mondi theoi sotéri hémon). 
Dative in the noble doxology. See Rom. 16:27, mondi 
sophoi thedi (to the alone wise God), where also we have dia 
L@sou Christou, but without tou kuriou hémén (our Lord) 
as here. Sdtér is used of God eight times in the N.T., six 
of them in the Pastoral Epistles. Doxa (glory) to God or 
Christ in all the doxologies except I Tim. 6:16.. Megalosuné 
(Majesty) is a late LXX word, in N.T. only here and Heb. 
1:3; 8:1. Before all time (pro pantos tou aionos). Eternity 
behind us. See same idea in I Cor. 2:7 pro ton aionon. Now 
(nun). The present. For ever more (eis pantas tous aionas). 
“Unto all the ages.” All the future. As complete a state- 
ment of eternity as can be made in human language.

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


RELATION TO THE FourTH GOSPEL 


There are few scholars who deny that the Epistles of John 
and the Fourth Gospel are by the same writer. As a matter 
of fact “in the whole of the First Epistle there is hardly a 
single thought that is not found in the Gospel” (Schulze). 
H. J. Holtzmann (Fahrbuch fur Protestantische Theologie, 
1882, p. 128) in a series of articles on the “Problem of the . 
First Epistle of St. John in its Relation to the Gospel” 
thinks that the similarities are closer than those between 
Luke’s Gospel and the Acts. Baur argued that this fact 
was explained by conscious imitation on the part of one or 
the other, probably by the author of the Epistle. The solu- 
tion lies either in identity of authorship or in imitation. 
If there is identity of authorship, Holtzmann argues that 
the Epistle is earlier, as seems to me to be true, while Brooke 
holds that the Gospel is the earlier and that the First Epis- 
tle represents the more complete ideas of the author. Both 
Holtzmann and Brooke give a detailed comparison of like- 
nesses between the First Epistle and the Fourth Gospel in 
vocabulary, syntax, style, ideas. The arguments are not 
conclusive as to the priority of Epistle or Gospel, but they 
are as to identity of authorship. One who accepts, as I do, 
the Johannine authorship of the Fourth Gospel for the rea- 
sons given in Volume V of this series, does not feel called 
upon to prove the Johannine authorship of the three Epis- 
tles that pass under the Apostle’s name. Westcott suggests 
that one compare John 1:1-18 with I John 1:1-4 to see how 
the same mind deals with the same ideas in different con- 
nections. ‘‘No theory of conscious imitation can reason- 

199

ably explain the subtle coincidences and differences in these 
two short crucial passages.” 


GNOSTICISM 


The Epistle is not a polemic primarily, but a letter for the 
edification of the readers in the truth and the life in Christ. 
And yet the errors of the Gnostics are constantly before 
John’s mind. The leaders had gone out from among the 
true Christians, but there was an atmosphere of sympathy 
that constituted a subtle danger. There are only two pas- 
sages (2:18f.; 4:1-6) in which the false teachers are specifically 
denounced, but “this unethical intellectualism” (Robert 
Law) with its dash of Greek culture and Oriental mysticism 
and licentiousness gave a curious attraction for many who 
did not know how to think clearly. John, like Paul in Co- 
lossians, Ephesians, and the Pastoral Epistles, foresaw this 
dire peril to Christianity. In the second century it gave 
pure Christianity a gigantic struggle. “The great Gnostics 
were the first Christian philosophers” (Robert Law, The 
Tests of Life, p. 27) and threatened to undermine the Gospel 
message by “deifying the devil” (i2., p. 31) along with de- 
throning Christ. There were two kinds of Gnostics, both 
agreeing in the essential evil of matter. Both had trouble 
with the Person of Christ. The Docetic Gnostics denied the 
actual humanity of Christ, the Cerinthian Gnostics distin- 
guished between the man Jesus and the gon Christ that came 
on him at his baptism and left him on the Cross. Some 
practised asceticism, some licentiousness. John opposes both 
classes in his Epistles. They claimed superior knowledge 
(gnosis) and so were called Gnostics (Gndstikoi). Nine times 
John gives tests for knowing the truth and uses the verb 
ginosko (know) each time (2:3, 5; 3:16, 19, 24; 4:2, 6, ry; 
5:2). Some of the leaders he calls antichrists. There are 
stories about John’s dread of Cerinthus and his unwillingness 
to be seen in the same public bath with him. The Apostle 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 201 


of love, as he is, is a real son of thunder when Gnosticism 
shows its head. Westcott thinks that the Fourth Gospel 
was written to prove the deity of Christ, assuming his hu- 
manity, while I John was written to prove the humanity of 
Christ, assuming his deity. Certainly both ideas appear in 
both books.

It is not clear to whom the Epistle is addressed. Like 
the Gospel, the Epistle of John came out of the Asiatic circle 
with Ephesus as the centre. Augustine has the strange 
statement that the Epistle was addressed to the Parthians. 
There are other ingenious conjectures which come to nothing. — 
The Epistle was clearly sent to those familiar with John’s 
message, possibly to the churches of the Province of Asia 
(cf. the Seven Churches in Revelation). 


Tue Date 


The time seems to be considerably removed from the 
atmosphere of the Pauline and Petrine Epistles. Jerusalem 
has been destroyed. If John wrote the Fourth Gospel by 
A.D. 9s, then the First Epistle would come anywhere from 
A.D. 85 to gs. The tone of the author is that of an old man. 
His urgent message that the disciples, his “little children,” 
love one another is like another story about the aged John, 
who, when too feeble to stand, would sit in his chair and 
preach “Little children, love one another.” The Mura- 
torian Fragment accepts the First Epistle and Origen makes 
full use of it, as does Clement of Alexandria. Irenzeus quotes 
it by name. Polycarp shows knowledge of it also.

CHAPTER I 


1. That which (ho). Strictly speaking, the neuter relative 
here is not personal, but the message “‘concerning the Word 
of life” (peri tou logou tes z0@s), a phrase that reminds one 
at once of the Word (Logos) in John 1:1, 14; Rev. 19:14 (an 
incidental argument for identity of authorship for all these 
books). For discussion of the Logos see on John 1:1-18 
(Vol. V). Here the Logos is described by #és 202s (of life), 
while in John 1:4 he is called Aé@ 202 (the Life) as here in 
verse 2 and as Jesus calls himself (John 11:25; 14:6), an ad- 
vance on the phrase here, and in Rev. 19:14 he is termed ho 
logos tou theou (the Word of God), though in John 1:1 the 
Logos is flatly named ho theos (God). John does use 4o in 
a collective personal sense in John 6:37, 39. See also pan 
ho in I John 5:4. From the beginning (ap archés). Anar- 
throus as in John 1:1; 6:64; 16:4. See same phrase in 2:7. 
The reference goes beyond the Christian dispensation, be- 
yond the Incarnation, to the eternal purpose of God in 
Christ (John 3:16), “coeval in some sense with creation” 
(Westcott). That which we have heard (ho akékoamen). Note 
fourfold repetition of ho (that which) without connectives 
(asyndeton). The perfect tense (active indicative of akoud) 
stresses John’s equipment to speak on this subject so slowly 
revealed. It is the literary plural unless John associates the 
elders of Ephesus with himself (Lightfoot) the men who © 
certified the authenticity of the Gospel (John 21:24). That 
which we have seen (ho heorakamen). Perfect active, again, 
of horad, with the same emphasis on the possession of knowl- 
edge by John. With our eyes (tois ophthalmois hémén). In- 
strumental case and showing it was not imagination. on 
John’s part, not an optical illusion as the Docetists claimed, 

204 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 205 


for Jesus had an actual human body. He could be heard 
and seen. That which we beheld (ho etheasametha). Repeti-. 
tion with the aorist middle indicative of theaomai (the very 
form in John 1:14), ‘“‘a spectacle which broke on our aston- 
ished vision” (D. Smith). Handled (epsélaphésan). First 
aorist active indicative of psélaphad, old and graphic verb 
(from psad, to touch), the very verb used by Jesus to prove 
that he was not a mere spirit (Luke 24:39). Three senses 
are here appealed to (hearing, sight, touch) as combining 
to show the reality of Christ’s humanity against the Docetic 
Gnostics and the qualification of John by experience to 
speak. But he is also “the Word of life” and so God 
Incarnate. 

2. Was manifested (ephanerothé). First aorist passive in- 
dicative of phanerod, to make known what already exists, 
whether invisible (B. Weiss) or visible, “intellectual or sensi- 
ble” (Brooke). In Col. 3:4 Paul employs it of the second 
coming of Christ. Verse 2 here is an important parenthesis, 
a mark of John’s style as in John 1:15. By the parenthesis 
John heaps reassurance upon his previous statement of the 
reality of the Incarnation by the use of hedrakamen (as in 
verse I) with the assertion of the validity of his “witness” 
(marturoumen) and “message” (apaggellomen), both present 
active indicatives (literary plurals), apaggel/6 being the pub- 
lic proclamation of the great news (John 16:25). The life, 
the eternal life (ten zoen ten aidnion). Taking up 20é of 
verse 1, John defines the term by the adjective aidnios, used 
71 times in the N.T., 44 times with z0¢ and 23 in John’s 
Gospel and Epistles (only so used in these books by John). 
Here it means the divine life which the Logos was and is 
(John 1:4; I John 1:1). Which (hétis). Qualitative relative, 
“which very life.” Was with the Father (én pros ton patera). 
Not egeneto, but é7, and pros with the accusative of intimate 
fellowship, precisely as in John 1:1 én pros ton theon (was 


206 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


with God). Then John closes the parenthesis by repeating 
ephanerothé. 

3. That which we have seen (ho heorakamen). Third use of 
this form (verses I, 2, 3), this time resumption after the 
parenthesis in verse 2. 4nd heard (kai akékoamen). Second 
(verse 1 for first) use of this form, a third in verse 5. Em- 
phasis by repetition is a thoroughly Johannine trait. De- 
clare we (apaggellomen). Second use of this word (verse 2 
for first), but aggelia (message) and anaggellomen (announce) 
in verse 5. That ye also may have (hina kai humeis echéte). 
Purpose clause with hina and present active subjunctive of 
echo (may keep on having). “‘Ye also” who have not seen 
Jesus in the flesh as well as those like John who have seen 
him. Like kai humin (to you also) just before. Fellowship 
with us (koinonian meth hémon). Common word in this 
Epistle, from koinodnos, partner (Luke 5:10), and koindned, 
to share, in (I Pet. 4:13), with meta emphasising mutual re- 
lationship (Acts 2:42). This Epistle often uses echd with 
a substantive rather than a verb. Yea, and our fellowship 
(kai hé koinonia de hé hémetera). Careful explanation of his 
meaning in the word “‘fellowship” (partnership), involving 
fellowship with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ 
and only possible in Christ. 

4. We write (graphomen hémeis). Literary plural present 
active indicative of graphd, which see in the singular in 
2:12-14. May be fulfilled (¢i pepléromené). Periphrastic — 
perfect passive subjunctive of p/érod, stressing the state of 
completion in the purpose (Aina), remain full, precisely as 
in John 16:24. See aorist subjunctive in John 15:11 and 
perfect indicative in John 17:13. The MSS. differ as often 
between hémon (our) and humén (your). 

5. And (kai). Mutual fellowship depends on mutual 
knowledge (Westcott). Message (aggelia). Old word (from 
aggelos, messenger), in N.T. only here and 3:11, and note 
ap autou (from God like apaggellé in verse 3) and anag- 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 207 


gellomen, to announce, to disclose, here as in John 4:25. 
God is light (ho theos phos estin). Precisely so the Logos is 
light (John 1:4-9) and what Jesus claimed to be (John 
8:12). John repeats it in negative form as he often does 
(John 1:3). 

6. [f we say (ean eipomen). Condition of third class with 
ean and second aorist (ingressive, up and say) active sub- 
junctive. Claiming fellowship with God (see verse 3) in- 
volves walking in the light with God (verse 5) and in the 
darkness (skotos here, but skotia in John 1:5). See 2:11 also 
for en tei skotidi peripated. We lie (pseudometha). Present 
middle indicative, plain Greek and plain English like that _ 
about the devil in John 8:44. Do not the truth (ou poioumen 
ten alétheian). Negative statement of the positive pseu- 
dometha as in John 8:44. See John 3:21 for “doing the 
truth,” like Neh. 9:33. 

7. If we walk (ean peripatimen). Condition of third class 
also with ean and present active subjunctive (keep on walk- 
ing in the light with God). 4s he (ds autos). As God is 
light (verse 5) and dwells in light unapproachable (I Tim. 
6:16). One with another (met’ allelén). As he has already 
said in verse 3. But we cannot have fellowship with one 
another unless we have it with God in Christ, and to do 
that we must walk in the light with God. nd the blood of 
Fesus his Son cleanseth us from all sin (kai to haima Iésou 
tou huiou autou katharizei hemas apo pasés hamartias). This 
clause with kai in true Johannine style is codrdinate with 
the preceding one. Walking in the light with God makes 
possible fellowship with one another and is made possible 
also by the blood of Jesus (real blood and no mere phantom, 
atoning blood of the sinless Son of God for our sins). John 
is not ashamed to use this word. It is not the mere “‘ex- 
ample” of Jesus that “cleanses” us from sin. It does cleanse 
the conscience and life and nothing else does (Heb. 9:13f.; 


208 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Titus 2:14). See in verse 9 both forgiveness and cleansing. 
Cf. I John 3:3. 

8. If we say (ean eipomen). See verse 6. We have no 
sin (hamartian ouk echomen). Yor this phrase see John 
9:41; 15:22, 24. That is, we have no personal guilt, no 
principle of sin. This some of the Gnostics held, since 
matter was evil and the soul was not contaminated by the 
sinful flesh, a thin delusion with which so-called Christian 
scientists delude themselves today. We deceive ourselves 
(heautous planodmen). Present active indicative of planad, 
to lead astray. We do not deceive others who know us. 
Negative statement again of the same idea, “‘the truth is 
not in us.” 

9. If we confess (ean homologomen). Third-class condi- 
tion again with ean and present active subjunctive of homo- 
logeo, “if we keep on confessing.” Confession of sin to God 
and to one another (James 5:16) is urged throughout the 
N.T. from John the Baptist (Mark 1:5) on. Faithful (pistos). 
Jesus made confession of sin necessary to forgiveness. It is 
God’s promise and he is “righteous” (dikaios). To forgive 
(hina aphéi). Sub-final clause with Aina and second aorist 
active subjunctive of aphiémi. And to cleanse (kai hagiaséi). 
So again with hina and the first aorist active subjunctive 
of katharizo (verse 7). 

10. If we say (ean eipomen). As in verses 6, 8. We have 
not sinned (ouch hamartékamen). Perfect active indicative 
of hamartano. This is a denial of any specific acts of sin, — 
while in verse 8 we have the denial of the principle of sin. 
David Smith observes that the claim to personal perfec- 
tionism has two causes, one the stifling of conscience in 
making God a liar (pseustén, the word used of the devil by 
Jesus in John 8:44), and the other ignorance of God’s word, 
which is not in us, else we should not make such a claim. 


CHAPTER II 


1. My little children (teknia mou). ‘Tender tone with this 
diminutive of seknon (child), again in 2:12 and 3:18, but 
paidia in 2:14. John is now an old man and regards his 
readers as his little children. That attitude is illustrated 
in the story of his visit to the robber to win him to Christ. 
That ye may not sin (hina mé hamartéte). Purpose (negative) 
clause with hina mé and the second aorist (ingressive, com. 
mit sin) active subjunctive of hamartand, to sin. John has 
no patience with professional perfectionists (1:8-10), but he 
has still less with loose-livers like some of the Gnostics who © 
went to all sorts of excesses without shame. Jf any man sin 
(ean tis hamartéi). ‘Third-class condition with ean and second 
aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive again, “‘if one com- 
mit sin.” We have (echomen). Present active indicative of 
echo in the apodosis, a present reality like echomen in II 
Cor. 5:1. 4n advocate (parakléton). See on John 14:16, 26; 
15:26; 16:7 for this word, nowhere else in the N.T. The 
Holy Spirit is God’s Advocate on earth with men, while 
Christ is man’s Advocate with the Father (the idea, but 
not the word, in Rom. 8:31-39; Heb. 7:25). As dikaios 
(righteous) Jesus is qualified to plead our case and to enter 
the Father’s presence (Heb. 2:18). 

2. And he (kai autos). He himself in his own person, both 
priest and sacrifice (Heb. 9:14). The propitiation (hilasmos). 
Late substantive from hilaskomai (Luke 18:13; Heb. 2:17), 
in LXX, Philo, Plutarch, in N.T. only here and 4:10. 
Christ himself is the means of propitiation for (peri con- 
cerning) our sins. See Ailastérion in Rom. 3:25. For the 
whole world (peri holou tou kosmou). It is possible to supply 
the ellipsis here of td hamartion (the sins of) as we have it 

209 


210 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


in Heb. 7:27, but a simpler way is just to regard “the whole 
world” as a mass of sin (5:19). At any rate, the propitia- 
tion by Christ provides for salvation for all (Heb. 2:9) if 
they will only be reconciled with God (II Cor. 5:19-21). 

3. Hereby (en toutdi). See this phrase also in 2:5; 3:16, 19, 
243 4:2, 13; §:2. That is explained by the ean clause, “‘if we 
keep his commandments” (ean térdmen, condition of the 
third class, ean with present active subjunctive, “if we keep 
on keeping”), the clause itself in apposition with toutdi (loca- 
tive case). Know we that we know him (ginoskomen hoti egno- 
kamen auton). “‘Know we that we have come to know and 
still know him,” egndkamen the perfect active indicative of 
gindskd. The Gnostics boasted of their superior knowledge 
of Christ, and John here challenges their boast by an appeal 
to experimental knowledge of Christ which is shown by 
keeping his (autou, Christ’s) commandments, thoroughly 
Johannine phrase (12 times in the Gospel, 6 in this Epistle, 
6 in the Apocalypse). 

4. I know him (Egnoka auton). Perfect active indicative 
with recitative oti like quotation marks just before it. This 
is one of the pious platitudes, cheap claptrap of the Gnostics, 
who would bob up in meetings with such explosions. John 
punctures such bubbles with the sharp addition “and keep- 
eth not” (ho mé téron, present active linear participle). 
“The one who keeps on saying: ‘I have come to know hin,’ 
and keeps on not keeping his commandments is a liar” 
(pseustés, just like Satan, John 8:44 and like I John 1:8, 10), | 
followed by the negative statement as in 1:8 and 10. There 
is a whip-cracker effect in John’s words. 

5. But whoso keepeth (hos d’ an teréi). Indefinite relative 
clause with modal an and the present active subjunctive, 
“whoever keeps on keeping.” Verily (aléthos). Truly, of a 
truth. This prize is open to all, not confined to a few initi- 
ated Gnostic intellectuals or pneumatics. Hath the love of 
God been perfected (hé agapé tou theou teteleidtai). Perfect 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN ant 


passive indicative of teleiod, stands completed. Probably 
objective genitive, our love for God, which is realized in 
absolute obedience (Brooke). Hereby (en toutoi). That is 
by continuous keeping of Christ’s commandments, not by 
loud talk and loose living. 

6. Himself also to walk (kai autos peripatein). Present 
active infinitive after opheilei (ought), ‘“Himself also to keep 
on walking,” a continuous performance, not a spasmodic 
spurt. Even as he walked (kathos ekeinos periepatesen). Con- 
stative aorist active indicative summing up the life of Christ 
on earth with the emphatic use of the demonstrative ekeinos 
in reference to Christ as in 3:3, 5, 7, 16; 4:17 and John 7:11; 
GePay 28 3e19s21. 

+. Beloved (agapétoi). First instance of this favourite 
form of address in these Epistles (3:2, 21; 4:1, 7; III John 
I, 2, 5, 11). No new commandment (ouk entolén kainén). 
Not novel or new in kind (kainén as distinct from neos, new 
in time, for which distinction see Luke 5:33-38). But an 
old commandment (all’ entolén palaian). Ancient as opposed 
both to kainos and neos. The Mosaic law taught love for 
one’s neighbours and Christ taught love even of enemies. 
Which ye had (hén eichete). Imperfect active, reaching back 
to the beginning of their Christian lives (ap’ archés). They 
had heard it expressly from Jesus (John 13:34), who, how- 
ever, calls it ‘a new commandment.” 

8. Again a new commandment (palin entolén kainén). 
Paradox, but truth. Old in teaching (as old as the story of 
Cain and Abel, 3:11f.), but new in practice. For this use 
of palin for a new turn see John 16:28. To walk as Christ 
walked is to put in practice the old commandment and so 
make it new (ever new and fresh), as love is as old as man 
and fresh in every new experience. True in him and in you 
(aléthes en autoi kai en humin). This newness is shown 
supremely in Christ and in disciples when they walk as Jesus 
did (verse 6). Because (hoti). Explanation of the paradox. 


212 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Is passing away (paragetai). Present middle indicative of 
parago, old verb, to lead by, to go by (intransitive), as in 
Matt. 20:30. Night does pass by even if slowly. See this 
verb in verse 17 of the world passing by like a procession. 
True (aléthinon). Genuine, reliable, no false flicker. 4/- 
ready shineth (édé phainei). Linear present active, “‘is al- 
ready shining” and the darkness is already passing by. 
Dawn is here. Is John thinking of the second coming of 
Christ or of the victory of truth over error, of light over 
darkness (cf. John 1:5-9), the slow but sure victory of 
Christ over Satan as shown in the Apocalypse? See 1:5. 

9. And hateth his brother (kai ton adelphon autou mison). 
Sharp contrast between the love just described and hate. 
The only way to walk in the light (1:7) is to have fellowship 
with God who is light (1:3, 5). So the claim to be in the 
light is nullified by hating a brother. Even until now (hes 
arti). Up till this moment. In spite of the increasing light 
and his own boast he is in the dark. 

10. Abideth (menei). Present active indicative, continues 
in the light and so does not interrupt the light by hating 
his brother. Occasion of stumbling (skandalon). See on 
Matt. 13:41; 16:23 for this interesting word. It is a stum- 
bling-block or trap either in the way of others (its usual 
sense), as in Matt. 18:7, or in one’s own way, as is true of 
proskopto in John 11:9 and in verse 11 here. But, as West- 
cott argues, John may very well have the usual meaning here 
and the other in verse 11. . 

11. Blinded (etuphlosen). First aorist active indicative of 
tuphloo, the very verb and form used in II Cor. 4:4 of the 
god of this age to keep men from beholding the illumina- 
tion of the gospel of the glory of Christ who is tne image of 
God. The first part of the verse repeats verse 9, but adds 
this vivid touch of the blinding power of darkness. In the 
Mammoth Cave of Kentucky the fish in Echo River have 
eye-sockets, but no eyes. 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 213 


12. I write (grapho). Present active indicative, repeated 
three times, referring to this Epistle. For “the name” see 
3:23 and III John 7. They were loyal to the name of Christ 
(Matt. 10:22). Are forgiven (aphedntai). Doric perfect pas- 
sive indicative of aphiémi (seen also in Luke 5:20, 23) for 
the usual apheintai. \ Teknia (little children) probably in- 
cludes all, as in verse 1. 

13. Fathers (pateres). Those mature believers with long 
and rich experience (egndkate, ye have come to know and 
still know). Him which is from the beginning (ton ap’ archés). 
See 1:1 as explaining this crisp description of the Word of 
life (cf. John 1:1-18). Young men (neaniskoi). The younger 
element in contrast to the fathers, full of vigor and conflict — 
and victory. Ye have overcome the evil one (nenikékate ton 
ponéron). Perfect active indicative of nikad, a permanent 
victory after conflict. The masculine article ton shows that 
the prince of darkness is the one defeated in this struggle, 
the devil plain in 3:8, 10 (John 8:44; 13:2). 

14. I have written (egrapsa). Repeated three times. Epis- 
tolary aorist referring to this Epistle, not to a previous 
Epistle. Law (Tests of Life, p. 309) suggests that John was 
interrupted at the close of verse 13 and resumes here in 
verse 14 with a reference to what he had previously written 
in verse 13. But that is needless ingenuity. It is quite in 
John’s style to repeat himself with slight variations. The 
Father (ton patera). ‘The heavenly Father as all of God’s 
children should come to know him. He repeats from verse 
13 what he said to “fathers.” To the young men he adds 
ischuroi (strong) and the word of God abiding in them. 
That is what makes them powerful (ischuroi) and able to 
gain the victory over the evil one. 

15. Love not the world (mé agapate ton kosmon). Prohibi- 
tion with mé and the present active imperative of agapad, 
either stop doing it or do not have the habit of doing it. 
This use of kosmos is common in John’s Gospel (1:10; 


214 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


17:14ff.) and appears also in I John 5:19. In epitome the 
Roman Empire represented it. See it also in James 4:4. 
It confronts every believer today. Jf any man love (ean tis 
agapai). ‘Third-class condition with ean and present active 
subjunctive of agapad (same form as indicative), “if any 
keep on loving the world.” The love of the Father (hé agapé 
tou patros). Objective genitive, this phrase only here in 
N.T., with which compare “love of God” in 2:5. In an- 
tithesis to love of the world. 

16. All that (pan to). Collective use of the neuter singular 
as in §:4, like pan ho in John 6:37, 39. Three examples, not 
necessarily covering all sins, are given in the nominative in 
apposition with paz to. “The lust of the flesh” (hé epi- 
thumia tés sarkos, subjective genitive, lust felt by the flesh) 
may be illustrated by Mark 4:19 and Gal. 5:17. So the 
genitive with hé epithumia tin ophthalmon (the lust of the 
eyes) is subjective, lust with the eyes as organs as shown 
by Jesus in Matt. 5:28. The use of the “movies” today 
for gain by lustful exhibitions is a case in point. For ala- 
zoneia see on James 4:16, the only other N.T. example. 
Alazon (a boaster) occurs in Rom. 1:30; II Tim. 3:2. Bios 
(life) as in 3:17 is the external aspect (Luke 8:14), not the 
inward principle (zd@). David Smith thinks that, as in the 
case of Eve (Gen. 3:1-6) and the temptations of Jesus (Matt. 
4:I-11), these three sins include all possible sins. But they 
are all “‘of the world” (ek tou kosmou) in origin, in no sense | 
“of the Father” (ek tou patros). The problem for the be- 
liever is always how to be in the world and yet not of it 
(John 17:11, 14ff.). 

17. Passeth away (paragetai). “Is passing by” (linear 
action, present middle indicative), as in verse 8. There is 
consolation in this view of the transitoriness of the conflict 
with the world. Even the lust which belongs to the world 
passes also. The one who keeps on doing (poidn present 
active participle of poied) the will of God “abides for ever” 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 215 


(menei eis ton aidna) “amid the flux of transitory things” 
(D. Smith). 

18. It is the last hour (eschaté hora estin). This phrase 
only here in N.T., though John often uses Aéra for a crisis 
(John 2:4; 4:21, 23; 5:25, 28, etc.). It is anarthrous here 
and marks the character of the “hour.” John has seven 
times “the last day” in the Gospel. Certainly in verse 28 
John makes it plain that the parousia might come in the 
life of those then living, but it is not clear that here he 
definitely asserts it as a fact. It was his hope beyond a 
doubt. We are left in doubt about this ‘“‘last hour” whether 
it covers a period, a series, or the final climax of all just at 
hand. As ye heard (kathés ékousate). First aorist active 
indicative of akoud. Antichrist cometh (antichristos erchetat). 
“Ts coming.” Present futuristic or prophetic middle indica- 
tive retained in indirect assertion. So Jesus taught (Mark 
13:6, 22; Matt. 24:5, 15, 24) and so Paul taught (Acts 20:30; 
II Thess. 2:3). These false Christs (Matt. 24:24; Mark 
13:22) are necessarily antichrists, for there can be only one. 
Anti can mean substitution or opposition, but both ideas 
are identical in the word antichristos (in N.T. only here, 
2:22; 4:3; 11 John 7). Westcott rightly observes that John’s 
use of the word is determined by the Christian conception, 
not by the Jewish apocalypses. Have there arisen (gegonasin). 
Second perfect active indicative of ginomai. Many anti- 
christs (antichristoi polloi). Not just one, but the exponents 
of the Gnostic teaching are really antichrists, just as some 
modern deceivers deserve this title. Whereby (hothen). By 
the fact that these many antichrists have come. 

19. From us (ex hémon)—of us (ex hémon). The same 
idiom, ex and the ablative case (h@mon), but in different 
senses to correspond with exé/than (they went out from our 
membership) and owk ésan (they were not of us in spirit and 
life). For ex in the sense of origin see John 17:15, for ex in 
the sense of likeness, John 17:14. For if they had been of us 


216 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(ei gar ex hémon ésan). Condition of second class with ef 
and imperfect tense (no aorist for eimi). They would have 
continued (memenékeisan an). Past perfect of mend, to re- 
main, without augment, with am in apodosis of second-class 
condition. With us (meth hémon). In fellowship, for which 
see meta in 1:3. They had lost the inner fellowship and then 
apparently voluntarily broke the outward. But they went 
(all’). Ellipsis of the verb exélthan above, a common habit 
(ellipse) in John’s Gospel (1:8; 9:3; 13:18; 15:25). That 
they might be made manifest (hina phanerothosin). Purpose 
clause with Aina and the first aorist passive subjunctive of 
phaneroo, for which verb see John 21:1; Col. 3:4. See II 
Cor. 3:3 for the personal construction with Aofi as here. 
They all are not (ouk eisin pantes). Not just some, but all, 
as in 2:21; 3:5. These antichrists are thus revealed in their 
true light. 

20. Anointing (chrisma). Old word for result (mat) and 
for the material, from chrid, to anoint, perhaps suggested 
by the use of antichristoi in verse 18. Christians are 
“anointed ones,” christoi in this sense, with which compare 
Ps. 105:15:‘‘ Touch not my anointed ones” (mé hapsésthe ton 
christon mou). These antichrists posed as the equals of or 
even superior to Christ himself. But followers of Christ do 
have “‘the oil of anointing” (to elaion tou chrismatos, Ex. 
29:7), the Holy Spirit. This word in the N.T. only here 
and verse 27. Later the term was applied to baptism after 
baptismal remission came to be taught (Tertullian, etc.). 
From the Holy One (apo tou hagiou). They receive this 
anointing of the Holy Spirit from the Anointed One, Jesus 
Christ (the Holy One). Cf. John 6:69; Acts 3:14. And ye 
know all things (kai oidate panta). But the best MSS. read 
pantes rather than panta, “Ye all know it.” This anointing 
is open to all Christians, not just a select few. 

21. L have not written (ouk egrapsa). Not epistolary aorist 
(2:14), but a reference to what he has just said. And be- 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN oi7 


cause no lie is of the truth (kai hoti pan pseudos ek tés aletheias 
ouk estin). Not certain whether oti here is causal (be- 
cause) or declarative (that). Either makes sense. Note 
the idiomatic use of ek and pan—ouk=ouden (no) as in 
verse Ig. 

22. The liar (ho pseustés). The liar (with the article) 
par excellence. Rhetorical question to sharpen the point 
made already about lying in 1:6, 10; 2:4, 21. See 5:5 for 
a like rhetorical question. But (ei mé). Except, if not. 
That denieth that Fesus is the Christ (ho arnoumenos hoti 
Tésous ouk estin ho Christos). Common Greek idiom for 
ouk to appear after arneomai like redundant mé in Luke © 
20:27 and Heb. 12:19. The old Latin retains zon here as 
old English did (Shakespeare, Comedy of Errors IV. ii. 7, 
“He denied you had in him no right”). The Cerinthian 
Gnostics denied the identity of the man Jesus and Christ 
(an gon, they held) like the modern Jesus or Christ con- 
troversy. This is the antichrist (houtos estin ho antichristos). 
The one just mentioned, Cerinthus himself in particular. 
Even he that denieth the Father and the Son ( ho arnoumenos 
ton patera kai ton huion). This is the inevitable logic of 
such a rejection of the Son of God. Jesus had himself said 
this very same thing (John 5:23f.). 

23. Hath not the Father (oude ton patera echei). “Not 
even does he have the Father” or God (II John 9). He 
that confesseth the Son (ho homologon ton huion). Because 
the Son reveals the Father (John 1:18; 14:9). Our only 
approach to the Father is by the Son (John 14:6). Confes- 
sion of Christ before men is a prerequisite for confession 
by Christ before the Father (Matt. 10:32 =Luke 12:8). 

24. As for you (humeis). Emphatic proleptic position be- 
fore the relative ho and subject of @kousate, a familiar idiom 
in John 8:45; 10:29, etc. Here for emphatic contrast with 
the antichrists. See 1:1 for ap’ archés (from the beginning). 
Let abide in you (en humin meneto). Present active impera- 


218 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


tive of mend, to remain. Do not be carried away by the 
new-fangled Gnostic teaching. 

25. And this is the promise (kai hauté estin hé epaggelia). 
See 1:5 for the same idiom with agge/lia (message). This is 
the only instance of epaggelia in the Johannine writings. 
Here “‘the promise” is explained to be “the life eternal” 
(1:2). In Acts 1:4 the word is used for the coming of the 
Holy Spirit. He promised (autos epéggeilato). First aorist 
middle indicative of epaggelld. Autos (he) is Christ as is 
seen in 3:3 by ekeinos. 

26. Concerning them that would lead you astray (peri ton 
planontin humas). “Concerning those that are trying to 
lead you astray” (conative use of the present active artic- 
ular participle of planad. See 1:8 for this verb. John is 
doing his part to rescue the sheep from the wolves, as Paul 
did (Acts 20:29). 

27. And as for you (kai humeis). Prolepsis again as in 
verse 24. Which ye received of him (ho elabete ap’ autou). 
Second aorist active indicative of /amband, a definite ex- 
perience, this anointing (chrisma), from Christ himself as 
in verse 20. This Paraclete was promised by Christ (John 
14:26; 16:13ff.) and came on the great Pentecost, as they 
knew, and in the experience of all who yielded themselves 
to the Holy Spirit. That any one teach you (hina tis didaskét 
humas). Sub-final use of hina and the present active sub- 
junctive of didasko, “that any one keep on teaching you.” 
Teacheth you (didaskei humas). Present active indicative. 
The Holy Spirit was to bring all things to their remembrance 
(John 14:26) and to bear witness concerning Christ (John 
15:26; 16:12-15). Yet they need to be reminded of what 
they already know to be “true” (a/éthes) and “no lie” 
(ouk estin pseudos), according to John’s habit of positive 
and negative (1:5). So he exhorts them to “abide in him” 
(menete en autoi, imperative active, though same form as 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 219 


the indicative). Precisely so Jesus had urged that the 
disciples abide in him (John 15:4f.). 

28. dnd now (kai nun). John tenderly repeats the ex- 
hortation, “keep on abiding in him.” Jf he shall be man- 
ifested (ean phanerothéi). Condition of third class with ean 
and first aorist passive subjunctive as in verse 19 and Col. 
3:3. A clear reference to the second coming of Christ which 
may be at any time. That we have boldness (hina schimen 
parrésian). Purpose clause with hina and the ingressive 
second aorist active subjunctive of echd, “that we may get 
boldness.” And not be ashamed (kai mé aischunthimen). 
Likewise negative purpose (after John’s fashion) with mé 
and the first aorist passive subjunctive of aischund, to put 
to shame. Before him (ap’ autou). “From him,” as if 
shrinking away from Christ in guilty surprise. See II Thess. 
1:9 for this use of apo (from the face of the Lord). 

29. If ye know (ean eidéte). Third-class condition again 
with ean and second perfect active subjunctive of oida. If 
ye know by intuitive or absolute knowledge that Christ 
(because of verse 28) is righteous, then “‘ye know” or “know 
ye” (gindskete either indicative or imperative) by experi- 
mental knowledge (so gindskd means in contrast with vida). 
Is begotten (gegennétai). Perfect passive indicative of gennad, 
stands begotten, the second birth (regeneration) of John 
3:3-8. Of him (ex autou). Plainly “of God” in verse 9 and 
so apparently here in spite of dikaios referring to Christ. 
Doing righteousness is proof of the new birth. 


CHAPTER ‘ITI 


1. What manner of love (potapen agapén). Qualitative 
interrogative as in II Pet. 3:11; Matt. 8:27. Only here in 
John’s writings. Originally of what country or race. Hath 
bestowed (dedoken). Perfect active indicative of didémi, state 
of completion, “the endowment of the receiver” (Vincent). 
That we should be called (hina klethomen). Sub-final use of 
hina with the first aorist passive subjunctive of ka/eé, to call 
or name, asin Matt. 2:23. Children (tekna). Asin John 1:12 
and with an allusion to gegennétai in 2:29 in an effort “to 
restore the waning enthusiasm of his readers, and to recall 
them to their first love” (Brooke). And such we are (kai 
esmen). “And we are.” A parenthetical reflection char- 
acteristic of John (kai nun estin in John 5:25 and kai ouk 
eisin in Rev. 2:2; 3:9) omitted by Textus Receptus, though, 
in the old MSS. Because it knew him not (hoti ouk egno 
auton). Second aorist active indicative of gindskd, precisely 
the argument in John 15:18f. 

2. Now (nun). Without waiting for the parousia or 
second coming. We havea present dignity and duty, though 
there is greater glory to come. J¢ is not yet made manifest 
(oupo ephanerothe). First aorist passive indicative of phan- 
erod. For the aorist indicative with oupd with a future 
outlook Brooke notes Mark 11:2; I Cor. 8:2; Heb. 12:4; 
Rev. 17:10, 12. What we shall be (ti esometha). Not tines 
(who), but #2 (what) neuter singular predicate nominative. 
“This what suggests something unspeakable, contained in 
the likeness of God” (Bengel). Jf he shall be manifested 
(ean phanerothéi). As in 2:28, which see. The subject 
may be Christ as in verse g, or the future manifestation 
just mentioned. Either makes sense, probably ‘‘it” here 

220 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 221 


better than “he.” Like him (homoioi autéi). Autii is as- 
sociative instrumental case after homoioi. This is our des- 
tiny and glory (Rom. 8:29), to be like Jesus who is like 
God (II Cor. 4:6). We shall see him even as he is (opsometha 
auton kathos estin). Future middle indicative of horad. The 
transforming power of this vision of Christ (I Cor. 13:12) 
is the consummation of the glorious process begun at the 
new birth (II Cor. 3:18). 

3. Set on him (ep’ autdi). Resting upon (epi) with loca- 
tive rather than eis, looking to, Acts 24:15. That is upon 
Christ (Brooke), upon God (D. Smith), upon God in Christ 
(Westcott). Purifieth himself (hagnizei heauton). Present 
active indicative of hagnizd, old verb, from hagnos (pure 
from contamination), used of ceremonial purifications (John 
11:55; Acts 21:24, 26 as in Ex. 19:10) and then of personal 
internal cleansing of heart (James 4:8), soul (I Pet. 1:22), 
self (here). Cf. Phil. 2:12f. the work of both God and 
man. As he is pure (kathos ekeinos hagnos estin). As in 
2:6 and 3:9 ekeinos (emphatic demonstrative) refers to 
Christ. Christ can be termed hagnos “in virtue of the per- 
fection of his humanity” (Westcott). Our destiny is to be 
conformed to the image of God in Christ (Rom. 8:29). 

4. Sin is lawlessness (hé hamartia estin hé anomia). ‘The 
article with both subject and predicate makes them co- 
extensive and so interchangeable. Doing sin is the con- 
verse of doing righteousness (2:29). The present active par- 
ticiple (poidn) means the habit of doing sin. 

5. He (ekeinos). As in verse 3 and John 1:18. Was 
manifested (ephanerothé). Same form as in verse 2, but 
here of the Incarnation as in John 21:1, not of the second 
coming (I John 2:28). To take away sins (hina tas hamartias 
aréi). Purpose clause with hina and first aorist active sub- 
junctive of aird as in John 1:29. In Is. 53:11 we have 
anaphero for bearing sins, but gird properly means to lift 
up and carry away (John 2:16). So in Heb. 10:4 we find 


222 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


aphaired and Heb. 10:11 periaired, to take away sins com- 
pletely (the complete expiation wrought by Christ on Cal- 
vary). The plural Aamartias here, as in Col. 1:14, not 
singular (collective sense) hamartian as in John 1:29. And 
in him is no sin (kai hamartia en autoi ouk estin). ““And 
sin (the sinful principle) in him is not.” As Jesus had claimed 
about himself (John 7:18; 8:46) and as is repeatedly stated 
in'the N.T.. (II Cor) ¢:27sHeb. 4:19 j.-penGyiget 9) 

6. Sinneth not (ouch hamartanei). Linear present (linear 
menon, keeps on abiding) active indicative of hamartand, 
“‘does not keep on sinning.” For mend (abide) see 2:6 and 
John 15:4-10. Whosoever sinneth (ho hamartanin). Present 
(linear) active articular participle like mendn above, “the 
one who keeps on sinning” (lives a life of sin, not mere 
occasional acts of sin as hamartésas, aorist active participle, 
would mean). Hath not seen him (ouch heoraken auton). 
Perfect active indicative of horad. The habit of sin is proof 
that one has not the vision or the knowledge (egndken, 
perfect active also) of Christ. He means, of course, spiritual 
vision and spiritual knowledge, not the literal sense of 
horad in John 1:18; 20:29. 

7. Let no man lead you astray (médeis planatd humas). 
Present active imperative of planad, “let no one keep on 
leading you astray.” See 1:8 and 2:26. Break the spell 
of any Gnostic charmer. He that doeth righteousness (ho 
potion ten dikaiosunén). “‘He that keeps on doing (present 
active participle of poied) righteousness.” For this idiom 
with poied see 1:6; 3:4. He (ekeinos). Christ as in verse 5. 

8. He that doeth sin (ho potion ten hamartian). ‘‘He that 
keeps on doing sin” (the habit of sin). Of the devil (ek tou 
diabolou). In spiritual parentage as Jesus said of the Phar- 
isees in John 8:44. When one acts like the devil he shows 
that he is not a true child of God. Sinneth from the begin- 
ning (ap’ archés hamartanei). Linear progressive present 
active indicative, “he has been sinning from the beginning” 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 223 


of his career as the devil. This is his normal life and those 
who imitate him become his spiritual children. That he 
might destroy (hina luséi). Purpose clause with Aina and 
the first aorist active subjunctive of Jud. This purpose (eis 
touto) Jesus had and has. There is eternal conflict, with 
final victory over Satan certain. 

9. Doeth no sin (hamartian ou poiei). Linear present ac- 
tive indicative as in verse 4 like hamartanei in verse 8. 
The child of God does not have the habit of sin. His seed 
(sperma autou). God’s seed, “the divine principle of life” 
(Vincent). Cf. John 1. And he cannot sin (kai ou dunatai 
hamarianein). This is a wrong translation, for this English 
naturally means “‘and he cannot commit sin”’ as if it were 
kai ou dunatai hamartein or hamartésai (second aorist or 
first aorist active infinitive). The present active infinitive 
hamartanein can only mean “‘and he cannot go on sinning,” 
as is true of hamartanei in verse 8 and hamartanon in verse 6. 
For the aorist subjunctive to commit a sin see hamartéte 
and hamartéi in 2:1. A great deal of false theology has 
grown out of a misunderstanding of the tense of hamar- 
tanein here. Paul has precisely John’s idea in Rom. 6:1 
epimenomen téi hamartiai (shall we continue in sin, present 
active linear subjunctive) in contrast with hamartésdmen in 
Rom. 6:15 (shall we commit a sin, first aorist active sub- 
junctive). 

10. In this (en toutoi). As already shown. A life of sin 
is proof that one is a child of the devil and not of God. 
This is the line of cleavage that is obvious to all. See John 
8:33-39 for the claim of the Pharisees to be the children of 
Abraham, whereas their conduct showed them to be children 
of the devil. This is not a popular note with an age that 
wishes to remove all distinctions between Christians and 
the world. Doeth not righteousness (ho mé poion dikaiosunén). 
Habit (linear present participle) again of not doing right- 
eousness, as in verse 7 of doing it. Cf. poiei and mé poidn 


224 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(doing and not doing) in Matt. 7:24, 26. Neither (kai). 
Literally, “and,” but with the ellipsis of ouk estin ek tou 
theou (is not of God). The addition here of this one item 
about not loving (mé agapon) one’s brother is like Paul’s 
summary in Rom. 13:9, a striking illustration of the general 
principle just laid down and in accord with 2:9-11. 

11. Message (aggelia). In N.T. only here and 1:5, but 
epaggelia (promise) fifty-one times. From the beginning (ap’ 
archés). See 1:1 for this phrase and 2:7 for the idea. They 
had the message of love for the brotherhood from the be- 
ginning of the gospel and it goes back to the time of Cain 
and Abel (verse 12). That we should love one another (hina 
agapomen allélous). Sub-final clause (content of the agge/ia) 
with Aina and present active subjunctive. John repeats the 
message of 2:7f. 

12. Of the evil one (ek tou ponérou). Ablative case and the 
same for neuter and masculine singular, but verse 10 makes 
it clear that the reference is to the devil. Slew (esphaxen). 
First aorist active indicative of sphazd, old verb, to slay, 
to butcher, to cut the throat (Latin jugu/are) like an ox in 
the shambles, in N.T. only here and Rev. (5:6, 9, 12, etc.). 
Wherefore? (charin tinos;). “For the sake of what?” Post- 
positive preposition (Eph. 3:1, 14) except here. The inter- 
pretation of the act of Cain (Gen. 4:8ff.) is an addition to 
the narrative, but in accord with Heb. 11:4. Jealousy led 
to murder. | 

13. If (ei). Common construction after thaumazd (won- 
der) rather than Aoti (that, because). Present imperative 
here with mé means “cease wondering.” Note mé thau- 
maséis (do not begin to wonder) in John 3:6 (an individual 
case). See this same condition and language in John 15:18. 

14. We know (hémeis oidamen). Emphatic expression. of 
hémeis (we) in contrast to the unregenerate world, the 
Christian consciousness shared by writer and readers. We 
have passed (metabebékamen). Perfect active indicative of 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 225 


metabaind, old compound to pass over from one place to 
another (John 7:3), to migrate, out of death into life. We 
have already done it while here on earth. Because (hoti). 
Proof of this transition, not the ground of it. We love the 
brethren (agapomen tous adelphous). Just this phrase (plural) 
here alone, but see 2:9 for the singular. He that loveth not 
(ho mé agapon). “The not loving man,” general picture and 
picture of spiritual death. 

15. 4 murderer (anthropoktonos).. Old compound (Eu- 
ripides) from anthropos (man) and kteind (to kill), a man- 
killer, in N.T. only here and John 8:44 (of Satan). No 
(pads—ou). According to current Hebraistic idiom =oudeis 
as in 2:19, 21. Abiding (menousan). Present active fem-~ 
inine accusative predicate participle of mend, ‘“‘a continuous 
power and a communicated gift” (Westcott). 

16. Know we (egnokamen). Perfect active indicative, “we 
have come to know and still know.” See 2:3 for “hereby” 
(en toutoi). Love (tén agapén). ‘The thing called love” 
(D. Smith). He for us (ekeinos huper hémon). Ekeinos as 
in 2:6; 3:3, 5, Auper here alone in this Epistle, though com- 
mon in John’s Gospel (10:11, 15; 11:50, etc.) and in III 
John 7. Laid down his life (tén psuchén autou ethéken). 
First aorist active indicative of tithémi, the very idiom used 
by Jesus of himself in John 10:11, 17f. We ought (hémeis 
opheilomen). Emphatic hémeis again. For opheilé see 2:6. 
Of course our laying down our lives for the brethren has 
no atoning value in our cases as in that of Christ, but is a 
supreme ‘proof of one’s love (John 13:37f.; 15:13), as often 
happens. 

17. Whoso hath (hos an echéi). Indefinite relative clause 
with modal an with hos and the present: active subjunctive 
of echd. The world’s goods (ton bion tou kosmou). ‘“The 
living or livelihood (not 262, the principle of life, and see 
2:16 for bios) of the world” (not in the sense of evil or 
wicked, but simply this mundane sphere). Beholdeth (the- 


226 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


drei). Present active subjunctive of thedred, like echei just 
before. In need (chreian echonta). ‘Having need” (present 
active predicate participle of echd, agreeing with adelphon). 
See the vivid picture of a like case in James 2:15f. Shutteth 
up (kleiséi). First aorist (effective) active subjunctive of 
kleid, to close like the door, changed on purpose from present 
tense to aorist (graphic slamming the door of his compas- 
sion, splagchna, common in LXX and N.T. for the nobler 
viscera, the seat of the emotions, as in Phil. 2:11; Col. 3:12). 
Only here in John. How (pds). Rhetorical question like 
that in James 2:16 (what is the use?). It is practical, not 
speculative, that counts in the hour of need. 

18. In word, neither with the tongue (logoi méde téi glossé). 
Either instrumental or locative makes sense. What John 
means is “not merely by word or by the tongue.” He does 
not condemn kind words which are comforting and cheer- 
ing, but warm words should be accompanied by warm deeds 
to make real “in deed and in truth” (en ergdi kai alétheiat). 
Here is a case where actions do speak louder than mere 
words. 

19. Shall we know (gndsometha). Future middle indica- 
tive of gindsko, at any future emergency, we shall come to 
know by this (ez toutoi) “that we are of the truth” (Aoti ek 
tés alétheias esmen). Before him (emprosthen autou). In the 
very presence of God we shall have confident assurance 
(peisomen ten kardian hémon, either we shall persuade our 
heart or shall assure our heart) because God understands us. 

20. Whereinsoever our heart condemn us (hoti ean katagin- 
oskéi hémon hé kardia). A construction like hoti an, what- 
ever, in John 2:5; 14:13. Katagindsk6 occurs only three 
times in the N.T., here, verse 21, Gal. 2:11. It means to 
know something against one, to condemn. Because God is 
greater than our heart (hoti meizon estin tés kardias hémon). 
Ablative kardias after the comparative meizin. And knoweth 
all things (kai gindskei panta). Just so Peter replied to 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 227 


Jesus in spite of his denials (John 21:17). God’s omnis- 
cience is linked with his love and sympathy. God knows 
every secret in our hearts. This difficult passage strikes 
the very centre of Christian truth (Brooke). 

21. If our heart condemn us not (ean hé kardia mé katagin- 
6skéi). Condition of third class with ean mé and present 
active subjunctive. The converse of the preceding, but not 
a claim to sinlessness, but the consciousness of fellowship 
in God’s presence. Boldness toward God (parrésian pros ton 
theon). Even in prayer (Heb. 4:16). See also 2:28. 

22. Whatsoever we ask (ho ean aitomen). Indefinite rela- 
tive clause with modal am and the present active subjunc- 
tive, like oti ean kataginoskéi in verse 20. In form no- 
limitations are placed here save that of complete fellowship 
with God, which means complete surrender of our will to 
that of God our Father.’ See the clear teaching of Jesus on 
this subject in Mark 11:24; Luke 11:9; John 14:12f.; 16:23 
and his example (Mark 14:36 =Matt. 26:39 =Luke 22:42). 
The answer may not always be in the form that we expect, 
but it will be better. We receive of him (lambanomen ap’. 
autou).. See 1:5 for ap’ autou (from him). Because (hoti). 
Twofold reason why we receive regularly (lambanomen) the 
answer to our prayers (1) “we keep” (téroumen, for which 
see 2:3) his commandments and (2) “we do” (poioumen, 
we practise regularly) “the things that are pleasing” (¢a 
aresta, old verbal adjective from areskd, to please, with 
dative in John 8:29 with same phrase; Acts 12:3 and in- 
finitive in Acts 6:2, only other N.T. examples) “in his 
sight” (endpion autou, common late vernacular preposition 
in papyri, LXX, and in N.T., except Matthew and Mark, 
chiefly by Luke and in the Apocalypse), in God’s eye, as in 
Heb..19:21:. 

23. His commandment (hé entolé autou). That (hina). 
Subfinal use of Aina in apposition with entole (command- 
ment) and explanatory of it, as in John 15:12 (entolé hina). 


228 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


See Christ’s summary of the commandments (Mark 12:28- 
31 =Matt. 22:34-40). So these two points here (1) We 
should believe (pisteusdmen, first aorist active subjunctive 
according to B K L, though Aleph A C read the present 
subjunctive pisteudmen) either in a crisis (aorist) or the 
continuous tenor (present) of our lives. The “name” of 
Jesus Christ here stands for all that he is, ““a compressed 
creed” (Westcott) as in 1:3. Note dative onomati here 
with pisteud as in 5:10, though eis onoma (on the name) 
in §:13; John 1:12; 2:23; 3:18. But (2) “we should love 
one another” (agapomen allélous), as he has already urged 
(2:7f.; 3:11) and as he will repeat (4:7, 11f.; II John 5) as 
Jesus (even as he gave us commandment, that is Christ) 
had previously done (John 13:34; 15:12, 17). There are 
frequent points of contact between this Epistle and the 
words of Jesus in John 13 to 17. 

24. And he in him (kai autos en autoi). That is “‘God 
abides in him” as in 4:15. We abide in God and God abides 
in us through the Holy Spirit (John 14:10, 17, 23; 17:21). 
“Therefore let God be a home to thee, and be thou the 
home of God: abide in God, and let God abide in thee” 
(Bede). By the Spirit (ek tou pneumatos). It is thus (by 
the Holy Spirit, first mention in this Epistle and ‘‘Holy” 
not used with “Spirit” in this Epistle or the Apocalypse) 
that we know that God abides in us. Which (hou). Abla- 
tive case by attraction from accusative ho (object of eddken) 
to agree with pueumatos as often, though not always. It 
is a pity that the grammatical gender (which) is retained 
here in the English instead of “‘whom,” as it should be. 


CHAPTER IV 


1. Beloved (agapétoi). Three times in this chapter (1, 7, 
11) we have this tender address on love. Believe not every 
Spirit (mé panti pneumati pisteuete). “‘Stop believing,” as 
some were clearly carried away by the spirits of error ram- 
pant among them, both Docetic and Cerinthian Gnostics. 
Credulity means gullibility and some believers fall easy 
victims to the latest fads in spiritualistic humbuggery. 
Prove the spirits (dokimazete ta pneumata). Put them to the — 
acid test of truth as the metallurgist does his metals. If it 
stands the test like a coin, it is acceptable (dokimos, II Cor. 
10:18), otherwise it is rejected (adokimos, I Cor. 9:27; II 
Cor. 13:5-7). Many false prophets (pollot pseudoprophétat). 
Jesus had warned people against them (Matt. 7:15), even 
when they as false Christs work portents (Matt. 24:11, 24; 
Mark 13:22). It is an old story (Luke 6:26) and recurs 
again and again (Acts 13:6; Rev. 16:13; 19:20; 20:10) along 
with false teachers (II Pet. 2:1). Are gone out (exeléluthasin). 
Perfect active indicative of exerchomai. Cf. aorist in 2:19. 
They are abroad always. 

2. Hereby know ye (en toutodi gindskete). Either present 
active indicative or imperative. The test of “‘the Spirit 
of God” (to pneuma tou theou) here alone in this Epistle, 
save verse 13. With the clamour of voices then and now 
this is important. The test (en toutdi, as in 3:19) follows. 
That Fesus Christ is come in the flesh (I@soun Christon en 
sarki eléluthota). The correct text (perfect active participle 
predicate accusative), not the infinitive (¢/é/uthenai, B Vg). 
The predicate participle (see John 9:22 for predicate accusa- 
tive with homologed) describes Jesus as already come in the 
flesh (his actual humanity, not a phantom body as the 

229 


230 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Docetic Gnostics held). See this same idiom in II John 7 
with erchomenon (coming). A like test is proposed by Paul 
for confessing the deity of Jesus Christ in I Cor. 12:3 and 
for the Incarnation and Resurrection of Jesus in Rom. 
10:6-10. 

3. Confesseth not (mé homologei). Indefinite relative clause 
with the subjective negative mé rather than the usual ob- 
jective negative ou (verse 6). It is seen also in II Pet. 1:9 
and Titus 1:11, a survival of the literary construction 
(Moulton, Prolegomena, p. 171). The Vulgate (along with 
Irenzus, Tertullian, Augustine) reads so/vit (/uei) instead 
of mé homologei, which means “separates Jesus,” apparently 
an allusion to the Cerinthian heresy (distinction between 
Jesus and Christ) as the clause before refers to the Docetic 
heresy. Many MSS. have here also en sarki eléluthota re- 
peated from preceding clause, but not A B Vg Cop. and not 
genuine. The spirit of the antichrist (to tou antichristou). 
Pneuma (spirit) not expressed, but clearly implied by the 
neuter singular article ¢o. It is a repetition of the point 
about antichrists made in 2:18-25. Whereof (ho). Accusa- 
tive of person (grammatical neuter referring to pneuma) 
with akoud along with accusative of the thing (Aoti erchetai, 
as in 2:18, futuristic present middle indicative). Here the 
perfect active indicative (akékoate), while in 2:18 the aorist 
(@kousate). And now already (kai nun édé). As in 2:18 also 
(many have come). “The prophecy had found fulfilment 
before the Church had looked for it” (Westcott). It is — 
often so. For édé see John 4:35; 9:27. 

4. Have overcome them (nenikékate autous). Perfect active 
indicative of uikad, calm confidence: of final victory as in 
2:13 and John 16:33. The reference in autous (them) is 
to the false prophets in 4:1. Because (hoti). The reason for 
the victory lies in God, who abides in them (3:20, 24; John 
14:20; 1§:4f.). God is greater than Satan, “‘he that is in 
the world” (ho en toi kosméi), the prince of this world 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 231 


(John 12:31; 14:30), the god of this age (II Cor. 4:4), 
powerful as he seems. 

5. Of the world (ek tou kosmou). As Jesus is not and as 
the disciples are not (John 17:14ff.). 4s of the world (ek 
tou kosmou). No “‘as” (Ads), but that is the idea, for their 
talk proceeds from the world and wins a ready hearing. 
The false prophets and the world are in perfect unison. 

6. We (hémeis). In sharp contrast with the false prophets 
and the world. We are in tune with the Infinite God. 
Hence “‘he that knoweth God” (ho gindskon ton theon, pres- 
ent active articular participle, the one who keeps on getting 
acquainted with God, growing in his knowledge of God) 
“hears us” (akouei hémon). This is one reason why sermons — 
are dull (some actually are, others so to dull hearers) or 
inspiring. There is a touch of mysticism here, to be sure, 
but the heart of Christianity is mysticism (spiritual con- 
tact with God in Christ by the Holy Spirit). John states 
the same idea negatively by a relative clause parallel with 
the preceding articular participle, the negative with both 
clauses. John had felt the cold, indifferent, and hostile 
stare of the worldling as he preached Jesus. By this (ek 
toutou). “From this,” deduction drawn from the preceding; 
only example in the Epistle for the common en toutdi as in 
4:2. The power of recognition (gindskomen, we know by 
personal experience) belongs to all believers (Westcott). 
There is no reason for Christians being duped by ‘“‘the spirit 
of error” (to pneuma tés planés), here alone in the N.T., 
though we have pueumasin planois (misleading spirits) in 
I Tim. 4:1. Rejection of the truth may be due also to our 
not speaking the truth in love (Eph. 4:15). 

7. Of God (ek tou theou). Even human love comes from 
God, ‘‘a reflection of something in the Divine nature itself” 
(Brooke). John repeats the old commandment of 2:7f. 
Persistence in loving (present tense agapomen indicative and 
agapon participle) is proof that one “has been begotten of 


232 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


God” (ek tou theou gegennétai as in 2:29) and is acquainted 
with God. Otherwise mere claim to loving God accompanied 
by hating one’s brother is a lie (2:9-11). 

8. He that loveth not (ho mé agapon). Present active ar- 
ticular participle of agapaé “keeps on not loving.” Knoweth 
not God (ouk egnoé ton theon). ‘Timeless aorist active indica- 
tive of gindsk0, has no acquaintance with God, never did get 
acquainted with him. God is love (ho theos agapé estin). 
Anarthrous predicate, not hé agapé. John does not say that 
love is God, but only that God is love. The two terms are 
not interchangeable. God is also light (1:5) and spirit (John 
4:24). 

9. Was manifested (ephanerothé). First aorist passive in- 
dicative of phanerod. The Incarnation as in 3:5. Subjective 
genitive as in 2:5. In us (en hemin). In our case, not 
“among us” nor “to us.” Cf. Gal. 1:16. Hath sent (apes- 
talken). Perfect active indicative of apostellé, as again in 
verse 14, the permanent mission of the Son, though in verse 
10 the aorist apesteilen occurs for the single event. See John 
3:16 for this great idea. His only-begotten Son (ton huion 
autou ton monogené). “‘His Son the only-begotten” as in 
John 3:16. John applies monogenés to Jesus alone (John. 
1:14, 18), but Luke (7:12; 8:42; 9:38) to others. Jesus alone 
completely reproduces the nature and character of God 
(Brooke). That we might live through him (hina zésimen di’ 
autou). Purpose clause with hina and the first aorist (in- 
gressive, get life) active subjunctive of 24d. “Through him” | 
is through Christ, who is the life (John 14:6). Christ also 
lives in us (Gal. 2:20). This life begins here and now. 

10. Not that (ouch hoti)—but that (all’ hoti). Sharp con- 
trast as in John 7:22; II Cor. 7:9; Phil. 4:17. We loved 
(2gapésamen). First aorist active indicative, but B reads 
égapekamen (perfect active, we have loved). He (autos). 
Emphatic nominative (God). To be the propitiation (hilas- 
mon). Merely predicate accusative in apposition with huion 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 233 


(Son). For the word see 2:2 and Rom. 3:25 for hilastérion, 
and for peri see also 2:2. 

11. If God so loved us (ei houtds ho theos égapésen hémas). 
Condition of first class with ¢i and the first aorist active 
indicative. As in John 3:16, so here houtds emphasises the 
manifestation of God’s love both in its manner and in its 
extent (Rom. 8:32). Ought-(opheilomen). As in 2:6. No- 
blesse oblige. ‘“Keep on loving,” (agapdin) as in 3:11. 

12. No one hath beheld God at any time (theon oudeis popote 
tetheatai). Perfect middle indicative of theaomai (John 1:14). 
Almost the very words of John 1:18 theon oudeis popote heo- 
raken (instead of tetheatai). If we love one another (ean aga- 
pomen allélous). Third-class condition with ean and the © 
present active subjunctive, “if we keep on loving one an- 
other.” God abideth in us (ho theos en hémin menei). Else 
we cannot go on loving one another. His love (hé agapé 
autou). More than merely subjective or objective (2:5; 4:9). 
“Mutual love is a sign of the indwelling of God in men” 
(Brooke). Is perfected (teteleidmené estin). Periphrastic (see 
usual form teteleidtai in 2:5 and 4:17) perfect passive indic- 
ative of feleiod (cf. 1:4). See verse 18 for “perfect love.” 

13. Hereby know we (en toutdi gindskomen). The Chris- 
tian’s consciousness of the fact of God dwelling in him is due 
to the Spirit of God whom God has given (dedoken, perfect 
active indicative here, though the aorist eddken in 3:24). 
This gift of God is proof of our fellowship with God. 

14. We have beheld (tetheametha). Perfect middle of thea- 
omai as in verse 12, though the aorist in 1:1 and John 1:14 
(etheasametha). John is qualified to bear witness (marturou- 
men as in 1:2) as Jesus had charged the disciples to do (Acts 
1:8). Hath sent (apestalken). As in verse 9, though apes- 
teilen in verse 10. To be the Saviour of the world (sotera tou 
kosmou). Predicate accusative of sdtér (Saviour), like Ailas- 
mon in verse 10. This very phrase occurs elsewhere only in 


234 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


John 4:42 as the confession of the Samaritans, but the idea 
is in John 3:17. 

15. Whosoever shall confess (hos ean homoldgéséi). Indefi- 
nite relative clause with modal ean (=am) and the first 
aorist active subjunctive, “whoever confesses.” See 2:23 
and 4:2f. for homologed. That (hoti). Object clause (indirect 
assertion) after homologed. This confession of the deity of 
Jesus Christ implies surrender and obedience also, not mere 
lip service (cf. I Cor. 12:3; Rom. 10:6-12). This confession 
is proof (if genuine) of the fellowship with God (1:3f.; 3:24). 

16. We know (egnokamen). Perfect active indicative, ‘‘we 
have come to know and still know” as in John 6:9, only 
there order is changed (pepisteukamen coming before egnd- 
kamen). Confession (homologeo) follows experimental knowl- 
edge (gindsk0) and confident trust (pisteud). Believers are 
the sphere (e” hémin, in our case) in which the love of God 
operates (Westcott). See John 13:35 for ““having love.” 
God 1s love (ho theos agapé estin). Repeated from verse 8. 
So he gathers up the whole argument that one who is abiding 
in love is abiding in God and shows that God is abiding in 
him. Thoroughly Johannine style. 

17. Herein (en toutoi). It is not clear whether the hina 
clause (sub-final use) is in apposition with ev toutéi as in 
John 15:8 or the oti clause (because) with the hina clause 
as parenthesis. Either makes sense. Westcott argues for 
the latter idea, which is reinforced by the preceding sentence. 
With us (meth hémon). Construed with the verb feteleidtai ~ 
(is perfected). In contrast to en hémin (verses 12, 16), em- 
phasising codperation. ‘God works with man” (Westcott). 
For boldness (parrésian) in the day of judgment (only here 
with both articles, but often with no articles as in II Pet. 
2:9) see 2:28. As he is (kathos ekeinos estin). That is Christ 
as in 2:6; 3:3, 5, 7, 16. Same tense (present) as in 3:7. 
“Love is a heavenly visitant” (David Smith). We are in 
this world to manifest Christ. 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 235 


18. Fear (phobos). Like a bond-slave (Rom. 8:15), not 
the reverence of a son (eulabeia, Heb. §:7f.) or the obedi- 
ence to a father (en phodbdi, I Pet. 1:17). This kind of dread 
is the opposite of parrésia (boldness). Perfect love (hé teleia 
agape). ‘There is such a thing, perfect because it has been 
perfected (verses 12, 17). Cf. James 1:4. Casteth out fear 
(exd ballei ton phobon). ‘“‘Drives fear out” so that it does 
not exist in real love. See ekballé exd in John 6:37; 9:34f.; 
12:31; 15:6 to turn out-of-doors, a powerful metaphor. Per- 
fect love harbours no suspicion and no dread (I Cor. 13). 
Hath punishment (kolasin echei). Old word, in N.T. only 
here and Matt. 25:46. Timdoria has only the idea of penalty, . 
kolasis has also that of discipline, while paideia has that of 
chastisement (Heb. 12:7). The one who still dreads (pho- 
boumenos) has not been made perfect in love (ou teteletdtat). 
Bengel graphically describes different types of men: “sine 
timore et amore; cum timore sine amore; cum timore et amore; 
sine timore cum amore.” 

19. He first (autos protos). Note protos (nominative), not 
proton, as in John 20:4, 8. God loved us efore we loved him 
(John 3:16). Our love is in response to his love for us. 
Agapomen is indicative (we love), not subjunctive (let us 
love) of the same form. There is no object expressed here. 

20. If a man say (ean tis eipéi). Condition of third class 
with ean and second aorist active subjunctive. Suppose one 
say. Cf. 1:6. I love God (Agapo ton theon). Quoting an 
imaginary disputant as in 2:4. And hateth (kai miset). 
Continuation of the same condition with eam and the pres- 
ent active subjunctive, “and keep on hating.” See 2:9 and 
3:15 for use of mised (hate) with adelphos (brother). 4 liar 
(pseustés). Blunt and to the point as in 1:10; 2:4. That 
loveth not (ho mé agapon). “The one who does not keep on 
loving” (present active negative articular participle). Hath 
seen (heoraken). Perfect active indicative of horad, the form 
in John 1:18 used of seeing God. Cannot love (ou dunatai 


236 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


agapain). “Is not able to go on loving,” with which com- 
pare 2:9, 0u dunatai hamartanein (is not able to go on sin- 
ning). The best MSS. do not have pds (how) here. 

21. That (hina). Sub-final object clause in apposition 
with entolén as in John 13:34; 15:13. From him (ap’ autou). 
Either God or Christ. See Mark 12:29-31 for this old com- 
mandment (2:7f.). 


CHAPTER V 


1. That Fesus is the Christ (hoti [ésous estin ho Christos). 
The Cerinthian antichrist denies the identity of Jesus and 
Christ (2:22). Hence John insists on this form of faith 
(pisteuon here in the full sense, stronger than in 3:23; 4:16, 
seen also in pistis in verse 4, where English and Latin fall 
down in having to use another word for the verb) as he 
does in verse 5 and in accord with the purpose of John’s 
Gospel (20:31). Nothing less will satisfy John, not merely © 
intellectual conviction, but full surrender to Jesus Christ as 
Lord and Saviour. “The Divine Begetting is the antecedent, 
not the consequent of the believing” (Law). For “‘is be- 
gotten of God” (ek tou theou gegennétai) see 2:29; 3:93 4:73 
5:4, 18. John appeals here to family relationship and family 
love. Him that begat (ton gennésanta). First aorist active 
articular participle of gennad, to beget, the Father (our 
heavenly Father). Him also that is begotten of him (ton 
gegennémenon ex autou). Perfect passive articular participle 
of gennad, the brother or sister by the same father. So 
then we prove our love for the common Father by our con- 
duct towards our brothers and sisters in Christ. 

2. Hereby (en toutdi). John’s usual phrase for the test of 
the sincerity of our love. ‘The love of God and the love 
of the brethren do in fact include each the other” (West- 
cott). Each is a test of the other. So put 3:14 with 5:2. 
When (hotan). ‘‘Whenever” indefinite temporal clause with 
hotan and the present active subjunctive (the same form 
agapomen as the indicative with hoti (that) just before, 
“whenever we keep on loving God.” And do (kai poidmen) 
“‘and whenever we keep on doing (present active subjunc- 

237 


238 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


tive of poied) his commandments.” See 1:6 for ‘“‘doing the 
truth.” 

3. This (haut@)—that (hina). Explanatory use of hina 
with hauté, as in John 17:3, to show what “the love of 
God” (4:9, 12) in the objective sense is, not mere declama- 
tory boasting (4:20), but obedience to God’s commands, 
“that we keep on keeping (present active subjunctive as in 
2:3) his commandments.” This is the supreme test. re 
not grievous (bareiai ouk eisin). “Not heavy,” the adjective 
in Matt. 23:4 with phortia (burdens), with /upoi (wolves) in 
Acts 20:29, of Paul’s letters in II Cor. 10:10, of the charges 
against Paul in Acts 25:7. Love for God lightens his com~ 
mands. 

4. For (hoti). The reason why God’s commandments are 
not heavy is the power that comes with the new birth from 
God. Whatsoever is begotten of God (pan to gegennémenon 
ek tou theou). Neuter singular perfect passive participle of 
gennao rather than the masculine singular (verse 1) to ex- 
press sharply the universality of the principle (Rothe) as 
in John 3:6, 8; 6:37, 39. Overcometh the world (ntkai ton 
kosmon). Present active indicative of nikad, a continuous 
victory because a continuous struggle, “Keeps on conquer- 
ing the world” (“the sum of all the forces antagonistic to 
the spiritual life,” D. Smith). This is the victory (hauté 
estin hé ntké). Yor this form of expression see 1:5; John 
1:19. Niké (victory, cf. nikad), old word, here alone in 
N.T., but the later form nikos in Matt. 12:20 and I Cor. 
15: af 57. That overcometh (hé nikésasa). First aorist ac- 
tive articular participle of nikad. The English cannot re- 
produce the play on the word here. The aorist tense singles 
out an individual experience when one believed or when 
one met temptation with victory. Jesus won the victory 
over the world (John 16:33) and God in us (I John 4:4) 
gives us the victory. Even our faith (hé pistis hemon). The 
only instance of pistis in the Johannine Epistles (not in 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 239 


John’s Gospel, though in the Apocalypse). It is our faith 
in Jesus Christ as shown by our confession (verse 1) and 
by our life (verse 2). 

5. And who is he that overcometh? (tis estin de ho nikon?). 
Not a mere rhetorical question (2:22), but an appeal. to 
experience and fact. ‘Note the present active articular par- 
ticiple (zikdn) like nikai (present active indicative in verse 
4), ‘‘the one who keeps on conquering the world.” See I 
Cor. 15:57 for the same note of victory (mikos) through 
Christ. See verse 1 for ho pisteudn (the one who believes) 
as here. Fesus is the Son of God (Iésous estin ho huios tou 
theou). As in verse 1 save that here ho huios tou theou in 
place of Christos and see both in 2:22f. Here there is sharp — 
antithesis between “Jesus” (humanity) and “‘the Son of 
God” (deity) united in the one personality. 

6. This (houtos). Jesus the Son of God (verse 5). He 
that came (ho elthon). Second aorist active articular par- 
ticiple of erchomai, referring to the Incarnation as a definite 
historic event, the preéxistent Son of God “‘sent from heaven 
to do God’s will” (Brooke). By water and blood (di’ hudatos 
kai haimatos). Accompanied by (dia used with the genitive 
both as instrument and accompaniment, as in Gal. 5:13) 
water (as at the baptism) and blood (as on the Cross). 
These two incidents in the Incarnation are singled out be- 
cause at the baptism Jesus was formally set apart to his 
Messianic work by the coming of the Holy Spirit upon him 
and by the Father’s audible witness, and because at the 
Cross his work reached its culmination (“It is finished,” 
Jesus said). There are other theories that do not accord 
with the language and the facts. It is true that at the Cross 
both water and blood came out of the side of Jesus when 
pierced by the soldier, as John bore witness (John 19:34), a 
complete refutation of the Docetic denial of an actual human 
body for Jesus and of the Cerinthian distinction between 
Jesus and Christ. There is thus a threefold witness to the 


240 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


fact of the Incarnation, but he repeats the twofold witness 
before giving the third. The repetition of both preposition 
(en this time rather than dia) and the article (¢0i locative 
case) argues for two separate events with particular em- 
phasis on the blood (“‘not only” ouk monon, “but” all’) 
which the Gnostics made light of or even denied. It is the 
Spirit that beareth witness (to pneuma estin to marturoun). 
Present active articular participle of martured with article 
with both subject and predicate, and so interchangeable as 
in 3:4. The Holy Spirit is the third and the chief witness 
at the baptism of Jesus and all through his ministry. Be- 
cause (hoti). Or declarative ‘“‘that.” Either makes sense. 
In John 15:26 Jesus spoke of “the Spirit of truth” (whose 
characteristic is truth). Here John identifies the Spirit with 
truth as Jesus said of himself (John 14:6) without denying 
personality for the Holy Spirit. 

7. For there are three who bear witness (hoti treis eisin hoi 
_ marturountes). At this point the Latin Vulgate gives the 
words in the Textus Receptus, found in no Greek MS. save 
two late cursives (162 in the Vatican Library of the fifteenth 
century, 34 of the sixteenth century in Trinity College, 
Dublin). Jerome did not have it. Cyprian applies the 
language of the Trinity and Priscillian has it. Erasmus did 
not have it in his first edition, but rashly offered to insert 
it if a single Greek MS. had it and 34 was produced with 
the insertion, as if made to order. The spurious addition is: 
en toi ouranodi ho pater, ho logos kai to hagion pneuma kai 
houtoi hoi treis hen eisin kai treis eisin hoi marturountes en 
tet géi (in heaven, the Father, the. Word, and the Holy 
Ghost: and these three are one. And there are three that 
bear witness in earth). The last clause belongs to verse 8. 
The fact and the doctrine of the Trinity do not depend on 
this spurious addition. Some Latin scribe caught up Cyp- 
rian’s exegesis and wrote it on the margin of his text, and 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 241 


so it got into the Vulgate and finally into the Textus Re- 
ceptus by the stupidity of Erasmus. 

8. The Spirit and the water and the blood (to pneuma kai 
to hudor kai to haima). The same three witnesses of verses 
6 and 7 repeated with the Spirit first. The three (hoi treis). 
The resumptive article. Agree in one (eis to hen eisin). 
“Are for the one thing,” to: bring us to faith in Jesus as the 
Incarnate Son of God, the very purpose for which John 
wrote his Gospel (20:31). 

g. If we receive (ei lambanomen). Condition of first class 
with ei and the present active indicative, assumed as true. 
The conditions for a legally valid witness are laid down in — 
Deut. 19:15 (cf. Matt. 18:16; John 8:17f.; 10:25; II Cor. 
13:1). Greater (meizon). Comparative of megas, because 
God is always true. For (hoti). So it applies to this case. 
That (hoti). Thus taken in the declarative sense (the fact 
that) as in John 3:19, though it can be causal (because) or 
indefinite relative with memarturzken (what he hath testi- 
fied, perfect active indicative of martured, as in John 1:32; 
4:44, etc.), a harsh construction here because of marturia, 
though some MSS. do read hen to agree with it (cf. verse 
10). See oti ean in 3:20 for that idiom. Westcott notes 
the Trinity in verses 6 to g: the Son comes, the Spirit wit- 
nesses, the Father has witnessed. 

10. Believeth on (pisteuon eis). John draws a distinction 
between “not believing God” (mé pisteudn toi thedi) in next 
clause, the testimony of God about his Son, and surrender 
to and reliance on the Son as here (eis and the accusative). 
See the same distinction less clearly drawn in John 6:30f. 
See also eis ten marturian after pepisteuken in this same verse 
and John 2:23. In him (en hautoi). “In himself,” though 
the evidence is not decisive between hautoi and autoi. Hath 
made (pepoiéken). Perfect active indicative of poied like 
memarturéken and pepisteuken, permanent state. 4 liar 
(pseustén). As in 1:10, which see. Because he hath not be- 


242 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


lieved (hoti ou pepisteuken). Actual negative reason with 
negative ou, not the subjective reason as in John 3:18, where 
we have hoti mé pepisteuken). The subjective negative is 
regular with ho mé pisteudn. Relative clause here repeats 
close of verse g. 

11. That God gave (hoti edoken ho theos). Declarative hoti 
in apposition with marturia as in verse 14 and John 3:19. 
Note aorist active indicative edoken (from didémi) as in 
3:23f., the great historic fact of the Incarnation (John 3:16), 
but the perfect dedoken in I John 3:1 to emphasize the abid- 
ing presence of God’s love. Eternal life (zéén aionion). An- 
arthrous emphasizing quality, but with the article in 1:2. 
In his Son (en toi huioi autou). This life and the witness 
also. This is why Jesus who is life (John 14:6) came to give 
us abundant life (John 10:10). 

12. Hath the life (echei ten z0én). The life which God gave 
(verse 11). This is the position of Jesus himself (John 5:24; 
14:6). 

13. I have written (egrapsa). Not epistolary aorist, but 
refers to verses I to 12 of this Epistle as in 2:26 to the pre- 
ceding verses. That ye may know (hina eidéte). Purpose 
clause with hina and the second perfect active subjunctive of 
oida, to know with settled intuitive knowledge. He wishes 
them to have eternal life in Christ (John 20:31) and to know 
that they have it, but not with flippant superficiality (2:3ff.). 
Unto you that believe on (tois pisteuousin eis). Dative of the 
articular present active participle of pistewd and eis as in 
verse 10. For this use of oxoma (name) with pisteud see 
3:23; John 2:23. 

14. Toward him (pros auton). Fellowship with (pros, face 
to face) Christ. For boldness see 2:28. That (hoti). De- 
clarative again, as in verse 11. Jf we ask anything (ean ti 
aitometha). Condition of third class with eam and present 
middle (indirect) subjunctive (personal interest as in James 
4:3, though the point is not to be pressed too far, for see 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 243 


Matt. 20:20, 22; John 16:24, 26). According to his will (kata 
to theléma autou). This is the secret in all prayer, even in 
the case of Jesus himself. For the phrase see I Pet. 4:19; 
Gal. 1:4; Eph. 1:5, 11. He heareth us (akouei hemon). Even 
when God does not give us what we ask, in particular then 
(Heb. 5:7f.). 

15. And if we know (kai ean oidamen). Condition of first 
class with ean (usually e2) and the perfect active indicative, 
assumed as true. See I Thess. 3:8 and Acts 8:31 for the 
indicative with ean as in the papyri. ‘“‘An amplification of 
the second limitation” (D. Smith). Wahatsoever we ask (ho 
ean aitometha). Indefinite relative clause with modal ean 
(=an) and the present middle (as for ourselves) subjunctive — 
of aited. This clause, like Aémén, is also the object of akouei. 
We know that we have (oidamen hoti echomen). Repetition of 
oidamen, the confidence of possession by anticipation. The 
petitions (ta aitemata). Old word, from aited, requests, here 
only in John, elsewhere in N.T. Luke 23:24; Phil. 4:6. We 
have the answer already as in Mark 11:24. We have asked 
(zitékamen). Perfect active indicative of aited, the asking 
abiding. y 

16. If any man see (ean tis idéi). Third-class condition 
with ean and second aorist active subjunctive of eidon (horad). 
Sinning a sin (hamartanonta hamartian). Present active 
predicate (supplementary) participle agreeing with adelphon 
and with cognate accusative hamartian. Not unto death (mé 
pros thanaton). Repeated again with hamartanousin and in 
contrast with hamartia pros thanaton (sin unto death). Most 
sins are not mortal sins, but clearly John conceives of a sin 
that is deadly enough to be called “unto death.” This dis- 
tinction is common in the rabbinic writings and in Numb. 
18:22 the LXX has Jabein hamartian thanatéphoron “to incur 
a death-bearing sin” as many crimes then and now bear 
the death penalty. There is a distinction in Heb. 10:26 
between sinning wilfully after full knowledge and sins of 


244 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


ignorance (Heb. 5:2). Jesus spoke of the unpardonable sin 
(Mark 3:29; Matt. 12:32; Luke 12:10), which was attributing 
to the devil the manifest work of the Holy Spirit. It is pos- 
sible that John has this idea in mind when he applies it to 
those who reject Jesus Christ as God’s Son and set themselves 
up as antichrists. Concerning this (peri ekeinés). This sin 
unto death. That he should make request (hina erotéséi). 
Sub-final use of hina with the first aorist active subjunctive 
of erdtad, used here as in John 17:15 and 20 (and often) for 
request rather than for question. John does not forbid 
praying for such cases; he simply does not command prayer 
for them. He leaves them to God. 

17. All unrighteousness is sin (pasa adikia hamartia estin). 
Unrighteousness is one manifestation of sin as lawlessness 
(3:4) 1s another (Brooke). The world today takes sin too 
lightly, even jokingly as a mere animal inheritance. Sin is 
a terrible reality, but there is no cause for despair. Sin not 
unto death can be overcome in Christ. 

18. We know (oidamen). As in 3:2, 14; 5:15, 19, 20. He 
has “‘ye know” in 2:20; 3:5, 15. Sinneth not (ouch hamar- 
tanei). Lineal present active indicative, “does not keep on 
sinning,” as he has already shown in 3:4-10. He that was 
begotten of God (ho gennétheis ek tou theou). First aorist 
passive articular participle referring to Christ, if the reading 
of A B is correct (térei auton, not térei heauton). It is Christ 
who keeps the one begotten of God (gegennémenos ek tou 
theou as in 3:9 and so different from ho gennétheis here). It 
is a difficult phrase, but this is probably the idea. Jesus 
(John 18:37) uses gegennémai of himself and uses also téred 
of keeping the disciples (John 17:12, 15; Rev. 3:10). The 
evil one (ho ponéros). Masculine and personal as in 2:13, 
not neuter, and probably Satan as in Matt. 6:13, not just 
any evil man. Touchest him not (ouch haptetai autou). 
Present middle indicative of haptd, elsewhere in John only. 
John 20:17. It means to lay hold of or to grasp rather than 


THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN 245 


a mere superficial touch (¢higgand, both in Col. 2:21). Here 
the idea is to touch to harm. The devil cannot snatch such 
a man from Christ (John 6:38f.). 

19. Of God (ek tou theou). See 3:10 and 4:6 for this idiom. 
Lieth in the evil one (en toi ponéroi keitai). Present middle 
indicative of the deféctive verb keimai, to lie, as in Luke 
2:12. Ponérdi is masculine, like ho ponéros in verse 18. 
This is a terrible picture of the Graeco-Roman world of the 
first century A.D., which is confirmed by Paul in Romans 
I and 2 and by Horace, Seneca, Juvenal, Tacitus. 

20. Is come (hékei). Present active indicative, but the 
root has a perfect sense, ‘has come.” See exélthon kai héki 
in John 8:42. An understanding (dianoian). Here alone in 
John’s writings, but in Paul (Eph. 4:18) and Peter (I Pet. 
1:13). John does not use gwdsis (knowledge) and nous 
(mind) only in Rev. 13:18; 17:9. That we know (hina ginos- 
komen). Result clause with Aina and the present active 
indicative, as is common with Aina and the future indicative 
(John 7:3). It is possible that here o was pronounced 6 as 
a subjunctive, but many old MSS. have hina gindskousin 
(plainly indicative) in John 17:3, and in many other places 
in the N.T. the present indicative with hina occurs as a 
variant reading as in John 5:20. Him that is true (ton alé- 
thinon). That is, God. Cf. 1:8. In him that is true (en toi 
aléthinoi). In God in contrast with the world “‘in the evil 
one” (verse 19). See John 17:3. Even in his Son Fesus 
Christ (en toi huidi autou Ié@sou Christoi). The autou refers 
clearly to en toi aléthinoi (God). Hence this clause is not in 
apposition with the preceding, but an explanation as to how 
we are “in the True One” by being “‘in his Son Jesus Christ.” 
This (houtos). Grammatically houtos may refer to Jesus 
Christ or to “the True One.” It is a bit tautological to 
refer it to God, but that is probably correct, God in Christ, 
at any rate. God is eternal life (John 5:26) and he gives it 
to us through Christ. 


246 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


21. Yourselves (heauta). Neuter plural reflexive because 
of teknia. The active voice phulassete with the reflexive ac- 
cents the need of effort on their part. Idolatry was every- 
where and the peril was great. See Acts 7:41: I Thess. 1:9 
for this word.

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


There is little to add to what was said about the First 
Epistle except that here the author terms himself “‘the elder” 
(ho presbuteros) and writes to “the elect lady” (eklektei 
kuriai). ‘There is dispute about both of these titles. Some 
hold that it is the mythical “presbyter John” of whom 
Papias may speak, if so understood, but whose very existence 
is disproved by Dom Chapman in Fohn the Presbyter and 
the Fourth Gospel (1911). Peter the apostle (I Pet. 1:1) © 
calls himself “‘fellow-elder” (sunpresbuteros) with the other 
elders (I Pet. 5:1). The word referred originally to age 
(Luke 15:25), then to rank or office as in the Sanhedrin 
(Matt. 16:21; Acts 6:12) and in the Christian churches (Acts 
11:30; 20:17; I Tim. 5:17, 19) as here also. A few even deny 
that the author is the same as in the First Epistle of John, 
but just an imitator. But the bulk of modern scholarly 
opinion agrees that the same man wrote all three Epistles 
and the Fourth Gospel (the Beloved Disciple, and many 
still say the Apostle John) whatever is true of the Apoca- 
lypse. There is no way of deciding whether “the elect lady” 
is a woman or achurch. The obvious way of taking it is to 
a woman of distinction in one of the churches, as is true of 
“the co-elect lady in Babylon” (I Pet. 5:13), Peter’s wife, 
who travelled with him (I Cor. 9:5). Some even take kuria 
to be the name of the lady (Cyria). Some also take it to 
be “Eklecta the lady.” Dr. Findlay (Fellowship in the Life 
Eternal, p. 31) holds that Pergamum is the church to which 
the letter was sent. The same commentaries treat I, II, 
and III John as a rule, though Poggel has a book on II, 
III John (1896) and Bresky (1906) has Das Verhaltnis des 
Zweiten Fohannesbriefes zum dritten. Dr. J. Rendel Harris 

249 


250 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


has an interesting article in The Expositor of London for 
March, 1901, on “‘The Problem of the Address to the Second 
Epistle of John,” in which he argues from papyri examples 
that kuria here means “my dear” or ‘‘my lady.” But Find- 
lay (Fellowship in the Life Eternal, p. 26) argues that ‘the 
qualifying adjunct ‘elect’ lifts us into the region of Christian 
calling and dignity.” It is not certain that II John was 
written after I John, though probable. Origen rejected it 
and the Peshitta Syriac does not have II and III John. 

1. And her children (kai tois teknois autés). As with eklekté 
kuria, so here tekna may be understood either literally as in 
I Tim. 3:4, or spiritually, as in Gal. 4:19, 25; I Tim. 1:2. 
For the spiritual sense in teknia see I John 2:1, 12. Whom 
(hous). Masculine accusative plural, though ¢eknois is neuter 
plural (dative), construction according to sense, not accord- 
ing to grammatical gender, “embracing the mother and 
the children of both sexes” (Vincent). See thus fous in 
Gal. 4:19. I (Egd). Though ho presbuteros is third person, 
he passes at once after the Greek idiom to the first and there 
is also special emphasis here in the use of agapd with the 
addition of en a/letheidi (in truth, in the highest sphere, as in 
John 17:19 and III John 1) and ouk egd monos (not I only, 
“not I alone”). Brooke argues that this language is unsuit- 
able if to a single family and not to a church. But Paul 
employs this very phrase in sending greetings to Prisca 
and Aquila (Rom. 16:4). That know (hoi egnokotes). Per- 
fect active articular participle of gindskd, “those that have 
come to know and still know.” 

2. For the truth’s sake (dia ten alétheian). Repetition of 
the word, one of which John is very fond (I John 1:6, “the 
truth, as revealed by the Christ, and gradually unfolded 
by the Spirit, who is truth” (Brooke). Which abideth in us 
(t2n menousan en hémin). See John 17:19 for “sanctified 
in truth” and I John 2:6 for abiding in Christ, and so it 
includes all who are in Christ. It shall be with us (meth 


SECOND EPISTLE OF JOHN oo 


hemon estat). Confident assertion, not a mere wish. Note 
the order of the words, ‘‘With us it shall be” (estai future 
middle of eimi). 

3. Shall be with us (estai meth’ hémon). He picks up the 
words before in reverse order. Future indicative here, not 
a wish with the optative (eie) as we have in I Pet. 1:2; II 
Pet. 1:2. The salutation is like that in the Pastoral Epis- 
tles: ‘Charis, the wellspring in the heart of God; eleos, its 
outpourings; ezréné, its blessed effect” (David Smith). And 
from Fesus Christ (kai para Iesou Christou). The repetition 
of para (with the ablative) is unique. “It serves to bring 
out distinctly the twofold personal relation of man to the_ 
Father and to the Son” (Westcott). “The Fatherhood of 
God, as revealed by one who being His Son can reveal the 
Father, and who as man (Jésou) can make him known to 
men” (Brooke). 

4. I rejoice (echarén). Second aorist passive of chairé as 
in III John 3, “of a glad surprise” (D. Smith), as in Mark 
14:11, over the discovery about the blessing of their godly 
home on these lads. Greatly (lian). Only here and III 
John 3 in John’s writings. I have found (heuréka). Perfect 
active indicative of heuriské as in John 1:41, our “eureka,” 
here with its usual force, a continued discovery. ‘‘He sits 
down at once and writes to Kyria. How glad she would be 
that her lads, far away in the great city, were true to their 
early faith” (David Smith). Certain of thy children (ek ton 
teknon). No tinas as one would expect before ek, a not in- 
frequent idiom in the N.T. (John 16:17). Walking (peri- 
patountas). Present active accusative supplementary par- 
ticiple agreeing with ¢inas understood. Probably members 
of the church off here in Ephesus. In truth (en alétheiai). 
As in verse 1 and III John 4. We received (elabomen). 
Second aorist active (possibly, though not certainly, liter- 
ary plural) of Jamband. This very idiom (entolen lambano) 


252 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


in John 10:18; Acts 17:15; Col. 4:10. Perhaps the reference 
here is to I John 2:7f.; 3:23. 

5. Beseech (eroto). For pray as in I John 5:16. Lady 
(kuria). Vocative case and in the same sense as in I. 4s 
though I wrote (hos graphon). Common idiom /és with the 
participle (present active) for the alleged reason. New 
(kainén). Asin I John 2:7f., which see. We had (eichamen). 
Imperfect active (late -a form like eichan in Mark 8:7) of 
echo and note eichete with ap’ archés in I John 2:7. Not 
literary plural, John identifying all Christians with himself 
in this blessing. That we love one another (hina agapomen 
allélous). Either a final clause after erdtd as in John 17:15 
or an object clause in apposition with ento/én, like I John 
2:27; 3:23 and like verse 6. 

6. Love (hé agapé). The love just mentioned. That we 
Should walk (hina peripatomen). Object clause in nominative 
case in apposition with agapé, with hina and the present 
active subjunctive of peripated, “that we keep on walking.” 
The commandment (hé entolé). The one just mentioned with 
the same construction with hina as in I John 3:23. John 
changes from the first person plural to the second (@kousate 
as in I John 2:7, peripatéte) as in I John 2:5, 7. In it (en 
autéi). Either to alétheiai (truth) of verse 4, agapé of this 
verse, or entolé of this verse. Either makes good sense, prob- 
ably “in love.” With peripated (walk) we have often en 
(I John 1:7, 11, etc.) or kata (according to) as in Mark 7:5; 

I Cor. 3:3; II Cor. 10:2, ete. 

7. Deceivers (planoi). Late adjective (Diodorus, Josephus) 
meaning wandering, roving (I Tim. 4:1). As a substantive 
in N.T. of Jesus (Matt. 27:63), of Paul (II Cor. 6:8), and 
here. See the verb (tén planontin humas) in I John 2:26 
of the Gnostic deceivers as here and also of Jesus (John 
7:12). Cf. I John 1:8. Are gone forth (exélthan, alpha end- 
ing). Second aorist active indicative of exerchomai, per- 
haps an allusion to the crisis when they left the churches 


SECOND EPISTLE OF JOHN 253 


(I John 2:19, same form). Even they that confess not (hot 
mé homologountes). ‘“The ones not confessing” (mé regular 
negative with the participle). The articular participle de- 
scribes the deceivers (planoi). That Fesus Christ cometh in 
the flesh (Iésoun Christon erchomenon en sarki). “Jesus 
Christ coming in the flesh.” Present middle participle of 
erchomai treating the Incarnation as a continuing fact which 
the Docetic Gnostics flatly denied. In I John 4:2 we have 
eléluthota (perfect active participle) in this same construc- 
tion with homologed, because there the reference is to the 
definite historical fact of the Incarnation. There is no allu- 
sion here to the second coming of Christ. This (houtos). 
See I John 2:18, 22; 5:6, 20. The deceiver and the antichrist — 
(ho planos kai ho antichristos). Article with each word, as 
in Rey. 1:17, to bring out sharply each separate phrase, 
though one individual is referred to. The one par excellence 
in popular expectation (I John 2:22), though many in reality 
(I John 2:18; III John 7). 

8. Look to yourselves (blepete heautous). Imperative ac- 
tive with reflexive pronoun as in Mark 13:9. The verb 
often used absolutely (Phil. 3:2) like our “look out.” That 
ye lose not (hina mé apoleséte). Negative purpose with hina 
mé and first aorist active subjunctive of apollumi. This is 
the correct text (B), not apolesomen (we). Likewise apola- 
bete (that ye receive), not apolabomen (we). Which we have 
wrought (ha érgasametha). This is also correct, first aorist 
middle indicative of ergazomai, to work (John 6:27f.). John 
does not wish his labour to be lost. See Rom. 1:27 for this 
use of apolamband for receiving. See John 4:36 for misthos 
in the harvest. The “full reward” (misthon pléré) is the 
full day’s wages which each worker will get (I Cor. 3:8). 
John is anxious that they shall hold on with him to the 
finish. 

9. Whosoever goeth onward (pas ho proagin). “Every one 
who goes ahead. Proagé literally means to go on before 


254 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(Mark 11:9). That in itself is often the thing to do, but 
here the bad sense comes out by the parallel clause. And 
abideth not in the teaching of Christ (kai mé menon en téi 
didachéi tou Christou). Not the teaching about Christ, but 
that of Christ which is the standard of Christian teaching 
as the walk of Christ is the standard for the Christian’s 
walk (I John 2:6). See John 7:16; 18:19. These Gnostics 
claimed to be the progressives, the advanced thinkers, and 
were anxious to relegate Christ to the past in their onward 
march. This struggle goes on always among those who 
approach the study of Christ. Is he a “landmark” merely 
or is he our goal and pattern? Progress we all desire, but 
progress toward Christ, not away from him. Reactionary 
obscurantists wish no progress toward Christ, but desire to 
stop and camp where they are. “True progress includes 
the past” (Westcott). Jesus Christ is still ahead of us all 
calling us to come on to him. 

10. If any one cometh and bringeth not (ei tis erchetai kai 
ou pherei). Condition of first class with ei and two present 
indicatives (erchetai, pherei). This teaching (tautén tén dida- 
chén). This teaching of Christ of verse 9, which is the stand- 
ard by which to test Gnostic deceivers (verse 7). John does 
not refer to entertaining strangers (Heb. 13:2; I Tim. 5:10), 
but to the deceiving propagandists who were carrying dis- 
sension and danger with them. Receive him not (mé lam- 
banete auton). Present active imperative with mé. For 
lambané in this sense see John 1:12; 6:21; 13:20. Into your 
house (eis oikian). Definite without the article like our at 
home, to town. Give him no greeting (chairein autoi mé 
legete). ““Say not farewell to him.”- Apparently chairein 
here (present active infinitive, object of /egete present active 
imperative with negative mé) is used of farewell as in II 
Cor. 13:11, though usually in the N.T. (Acts 15:23; 23:26; 
James 1:1) of the salutation. But here the point turns on 
the stranger bringing into the house (or trying to do so) 


SECOND EPISTLE OF JOHN S25 


his heretical and harmful teaching which seems to be after 
the salutation is over. The usual greeting to a house is 
given in Luke 10:5. On the other hand, if chairein means 
greeting, not farewell, here, it can very well be understood 
of the peril of allowing these Gnostic propagandists to 
spread their pernicious teachings (cf. Mormons or Bolshe- 
vists) in home and church. (usually meeting in the home). 
This is assuming that the men were known and not mere 
strangers. 

11. Partaketh in his evil works (koinonei tois ergois autou 
tois ponérois). Associative instrumental case with koindnet 
as in I Tim. 5:22, common verb from koinonos (partner). 
It is to be borne in mind that the churches often met in 
private homes (Rom. 16:5; Col. 4:15), and if these travelling 
deceivers were allowed to spread their doctrines in these 
homes and then sent on with endorsement as Apollos was 
from Ephesus to Corinth (Acts 18:27), there was no way 
of escaping responsibility for the harm wrought by these 
propagandists of evil. It is not a case of mere hospitality 
to strangers. 

12. I would not (ouk ebouléthén). Epistolary aorist (first 
passive indicative). With paper and ink (dia chartou kat 
melanos). ‘The chartés was a leaf of papyrus prepared for 
writing by cutting the pith into strips and pasting together, 
old word (Jer. 43:23), here only in N.T. Méelas is old ad- 
jective for black (Matt. 5:36; Rev. 6:5, 12), and for black 
ink here, III John 13; II Cor. 3:3. Apparently John wrote 
this little letter with his own hand. To come (genesthat). 
Second aorist middle infinitive of ginomai after elpiz0, I 
hope. Face to face (stoma pros stoma). “Mouth to mouth.” 
So in III John 14 and Numb. 12:8. “Face to face” (pros- 
dpon pros prosopon) we have in I Cor. 13:12. Your (humon). 
Or “our” (amon). Both true. That may be fulfilled (hina 
pepléromené 2). Purpose clause with hina and the peri- 


256 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


phrastic perfect passive subjunctive of p/érod, as in I John 
1:4, which see. 

13. Of thine elect sister (tés adelphés sou tes eklektés). Same 
word ek/ekté as in verse 1 and Rev. 17:4. Apparently chil- 
dren of a deceased sister of the lady of verse 1 who lived 
in Ephesus and whom John knew as members of his church 
there.

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


Certainly ITI John‘is addressed to an individual, not to 
a church, though which Gaius we do not know. There are 
three friends of Paul with this name; Gaius of Corinth (I 
Cor. 1:14), Gaius of Macedonia (Acts 19:29), Gaius of Derbe 
(Acts 20:4), but it is unlikely that this Gaius of Pergamum 
(Findlay would call him) is either of these, though the 
Apostolical Constitutions does identify him with Gaius of 
Derbe. It is possible that in III John g there is an allusion © 
to II John and, if so, then both letters went to individuals 
in the same church (one a loyal woman, the other a loyal 
man). Three persons are sharply sketched in III John 
(Gaius, Diotrephes, Demetrius). Gaius is the dependable 
layman in the church, Diotrephes the dominating official, 
Demetrius the kindly messenger from Ephesus with the 
letter, a vivid picture of early church life and missionary 
work. John is at Ephesus, the last of the apostles, and with 
an eagle’s eye surveys the work in Asia Minor. The same 
Gnostic deceivers are at work as in the other Johannine 
Epistles. Pergamum is described in Rev. 2:13 as the place 
“‘where Satan’s throne is.” 

1. The beloved (toi agapétoi). Four times in this short 
letter this verbal adjective is used of Gaius (here, 2, 5, 11). 
See II John 1 for the same phrase here, “whom I love in 
truth.” 

2. I pray (euchomai). Here only in John’s writings. See 
Rom. 9:3. In all things (peri panton). To be taken with 
euodousthai and like peri in I. Cor. 16:1, “concerning all 
things.” Thou mayest prosper (se euodousthai). Infinitive 
in indirect discourse (object infinitive) after euchomai, with 
accusative of general reference se (as to thee). Euodod is old 

259 


260 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


verb (from euodos, eu and hodos, prosperous in a journey), 
to have a good journey, to prosper, in LXX, in N.T. only 
this verse (twice), I Cor. 16:2; Rom. 1:10. Be in health 
(hugiainein). In Paul this word always means sound teach- 
ing (I Tim. 1:10; 6:3), but here and in Luke 5:31; 7:10; 
15:27, of bodily health. Brooke wonders if Gaius’ health 
had caused his friends anxiety. Even as thy soul prospereth 
(kathos euodoutai sou hé psuché). A remarkable comparison 
which assumes the welfare (present middle indicative of 
euodod) of his soul (psuché here as the principle of the higher 
life as in John 12:27, not of the natural life as in Matt. 6:25). 

3. I rejoiced greatly (echarén lian). As in II John 4 and 
Phil. 4:10, not epistolary aorist, but reference to his emo- 
tions at the good tidings about Gaius. When brethren came 
(erchomenon adelphin). Genitive absolute with present mid- 
dle participle of erchomai, and so with marturounton (bare 
witness, present active participle of martured). Present par- 
ticiple here denotes repetition, from time to time. To the 
truth (tet alétheiai). Dative case. “As always in the Johan- 
nine writings, ‘truth’ covers every sphere of life, moral, 
intellectual, spiritual” (Brooke). Even as thou walkest in 
truth (kathos su en alétheiai peripateis). “Thou” in contrast 
to Diotrephes (verse g) and others like him. On peripated 
see I John 1:6 and on en alétheiai see II John 4. 

4. Greater (meizoteran). A double comparative with -teros 
added to meizon, like our “‘lesser” and like mallon kreisson 
(more better) in Phil. 1:23. In Eph. 3:8 we have elachisto- 
teroi, a comparative on a superlative. Like forms occur in 
the vernacular papyri and even in Homer (cheiroteros, more 
worse) as also in Shakespeare. oy (charan). B reads 
charin (grace). Than this (touton). Ablative neuter plural 
after the comparative. To hear of (hina akoud). Object 
clause (epexegetic) with hina and akoud, the present active 
subjunctive (keep on hearing of) in apposition with souti».. 
Walking in truth (en alétheiai peripatounta). As in II John 


THIRD EPISTLE OF JOHN 261 


4, which see. By the use of tekna John may mean that 
Gaius is one of his converts (I Tim. 1:1). 

5. A faithful work (piston). Either thus or “thou makest 
sure,’ after an example in Xénophon quoted by Wettstein 
(potein pista) and parallel to kaina poied in Rev. 21:5. But 
It is not certain. In-whatsoever thou doest (ho ean ergasét). 
Indefinite relative with modal ean (=an) and the first aorist 
middle subjunctive of ergazomai. See Col. 3:23 for both 
poteo and ergazomai in the same sentence. And strangers 
withal (kai touto xenous). ‘And that too” (accusative of 
general reference as in I Cor. 6:6; Phil. 1:28; Eph. 2:8). 
This praise of hospitality (Rom. 12:13; I Pet. 4:9; 1 Tim. 3:2; 
§:10; Titus 1:8; Heb. 13:2) shows that in II John 10 John © 
has a peculiar case in mind. 

6. Before the church (endpion ekklesias). Public meeting as 
the anarthrous use of ekk/ésia indicates, like en ekklésiai in I 
Cor. 14:19, 35. Thou wilt do well (kalos poiéseis). Future 
active of poied with adverb kalds, a common polite phrase 
in letters (papyri) like our “‘please.” See also Acts 10:33; 
James 2:19; I Cor. 7:37f.; Phil. 4:14; II Pet. 1:19. To set 
forward on their journey (propempsas). First aorist active 
participle (simultaneous action) of propempd, to send for- 
ward, “sending forward,” old word, in N.T. in Acts 15:3; 
20:385 212531 Cor..16:6, 115-1] Cori1:16;:Rom. 15:24; Titue 
3:13. Worthily of God (axids tou theou). Precisely this 
phrase in I Thess. 2:12 and the genitive with ax70s also in 
Rom. 16:2; Phil. 1:27; Col. 1:10; Eph. 4:1. See John 13:20 
for Christ’s words on the subject. “Since they are God’s 
representatives, treat them as you would God” (Holtzmann). 
From Homer’s time (Od. XV. 74) it was customary to speed 
the parting guest, sometimes accompanying him, sometimes 
providing money and food. Rabbis were so escorted and 
Paul alludes to the same gracious custom in Rom. 15:24 
and Titus 3:13. 

7. For the sake of the Name (huper tou onomatos). The 


262 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


name of Jesus. See Acts 5:4; Rom. 1:5 for huper tou ono- 
matos and James 2:7 for the absolute use of “the name” as 
in I Pet. 4:16. ‘This name is in essence the sum of the 
Christian creed” (Westcott) as in I Cor. 12:3; Rom. 10:9. 
It is like the absolute use of “the Way” (Acts 9:2; 19:9, 233 
24:22). Taking nothing (méden lambanontes). Present active 
participle with the usual negative with participles (I John 
2:4). Of the Gentiles (apo ton ethnikon). Instead of the usual 
ethnon (Luke 2:32), late adjective for what is peculiar to a 
people (ethnos) and then for the people themselves (Polyb- 
ius, Diodorus, not in LXX), in N.T. only here, Matt. 5:47; 
6:7; 18:17. Like our heathen, pagan. John is anxious that 
Christian missionaries receive nothing from the heathen, as 
our missionaries have to watch against the charge of being 
after money. There were many travelling lecturers out for 
money. Paul in I Cor. g defends the right of preachers to 
pay, but refuses himself to accept it from Corinth because 
it would be misunderstood (cf. I Thess. 2:6ff.; II Cor. 12:16ff. 
12:16ff.). Note apo here as in collecting taxes (Matt. 17:25) 
rather than para, which may be suggestive. 

8. Ought (opheilomen). See for this word I John 2:6; 3:16; 
4:11. To welcome (hupolambanein). Present active infinitive 
(habit of welcoming) of hupolambané, old word, to take up 
under, to carry off (Acts 1:9), to reply (Luke 10:30), to 
suppose (Acts 2:15), only here in N.T. in this sense of receiv- 
ing hospitably or to take under one’s protection like Aupo- 
dechomai (Luke 10:38). Such (tous toioutous). “The such” ~ 
according to the Greek idiom (I Cor. 16:16, 18). That we 
may be (hina gindmetha). Purpose clause with hina and the 
present middle subjunctive of ginomai, “that we may keep 
on becoming.” Fellow-workers (sunergoi). Old compound 
(sun, ergon). With the truth (téi alétheiai). So associative 
instrumental case with sun in sunergoi, but it is not certain 
that this is the idea, though suzerged is so used with ergois 
in James 2:22. Swnergos itself occurs with the genitive of 


THIRD EPISTLE OF JOHN 263 


the person as in theou sunergoi (I Cor. 3:9) or with genitive 
of the thing ¢és charas (I Cor. 3:9). So then here the meaning 
may be either “co-workers with such brethren for the truth” 
(dative of advantage) or “‘co-workers with the truth” (asso- 
ciative instrumental case). 

g. I wrote somewhat unto the church (egrapsa ti téi ekklesiat). 
A few MSS. add az to indicate that he had not written (con- 
clusion of second-class condition), clearly spurious. Not 
epistolary aorist nor a reference to II John as Findlay holds, 
but an allusion to a brief letter of commendation (Acts 18:27; 
II Cor. 3:1; Col. 4:10) sent along with the brethren in verses 
§ to 7 or to some other itinerant brethren. Westcott wrongly 
thinks that fi is never used of anything important in the — 
N.T. (Acts 8:9; Gal. 6:3), and hence that this lost letter 
was unimportant. It may have been brief and a mere intro- 
duction. Diotrephes (Dios and trephé, nourished by Zeus). 
This ambitious leader and sympathiser with the Gnostics 
would probably prevent the letter referred to being read to 
the church, whether it was II John condemning the Gnostics 
or another letter commending Demetrius and John’s mis- 
sionaries. Hence he sends Gaius this personal letter warning 
against Diotrephes. Who loveth to have the preéminence among 
them (ho philoproteuon auton). Present active articular par- 
ticiple of a late verb, so far found only here and in ecclesi- 
astical writers (the example cited by Blass being an error, 
Deissmann, Light etc., p. 76), from philoprotos, fond of being 
first (Plutarch), and made like philoponed (papyri), to be 
fond of toil. This ambition of Diotrephes does not prove 
that he was a bishop over elders, as was true in the second 
century (as Ignatius shows). He may have been an elder 
(bishop) or deacon, but clearly desired to rule the whole 
church. Some forty years ago I wrote an article on Diotre- 
phes for a denominational paper. The editor told me that 
twenty-five deacons stopped the paper to show their resent- 
ment against being personally attacked in the paper. Ke- 


264 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


ceiveth us not (ouk epidechetai hémas). Present active indica- 
tive of this old compound, in N.T. only here and verse Io. 
Diotrephes refused to accept John’s authority or those who 
sided with him, John’s missionaries or delegates (cf. Matt. 
10:40). 

10. If I come (ean eltho).. Condition of third class with 
ean and second aorist active subjunctive of erchomai. He 
hopes to come (verse 14), as he had said in II John 12 (one 
argument for identifying II John with the letter in III 
John 9). JI will bring to remembrance (hupomnéso). Future 
active indicative of hupomimnéskod, old compound (John 
14:26; II Pet. 1:12). The aged apostle is not afraid of 
Diotrephes and here defies him. Which he doeth (ha poiei). 
Present active indicative, “which he keeps on doing.” 
Prating against us (phluaron hémas). Present active parti- 
ciple of old verb (from phluaros, babbling I Tim. 5:13), to 
accuse idly and so falsely, here only in N.T. with accusative 
hémas (us). With wicked words (logois ponérois). Instru- 
mental case. Not simply foolish chatter, but malevolent 
words. Not content (mé arkoumenos). Present passive par- 
ticiple of arked with usual negative mé. For this verb in 
this sense see I Tim. 6:8 and Heb. 13:5, only there epi is 
absent. John knows that the conduct of Diotrephes will 
not stand the light. See Paul’s threats of exposure (I Cor. 
4:21; II Cor. 10:11; 13:1-3). And John is the apostle of 
love all the same. He himself (autos). That was bad enough. 
Them that would (tous boulomenous). “Those willing or wish- | 
ing or receive the brethren” from John. He forbiddeth 
(koluei). “‘He hinders.” Present active indicative of kolud 
and means either actual success in one case (punctiliar use 
of the present indicative) or repetition in several instances 
(linear action) or conative action attempted, but not suc- 
cessful as in Matt. 3:14 (this same verb) and John 10:32. 
Casteth them out of the church (ek tés ekklésias ekballei). Were 
again ekballei can be understood in various ways, like ko/uei. 


THIRD EPISTLE OF JOHN 265 


This verb occurs in John 2:15 for casting out of the temple 
the profaners of it and for casting the blind man out of the 
synagogue (John 9:34f.). If this ancient “church-boss” did 
not succeed in expelling John’s adherents from the church, 
he certainly tried to do it. 

11. [mitate not (mé mimou). Present middle imperative in 
prohibition (do not have the habit of imitating) of mimeomai 
(from mimos, actor, mimic), old word, in N.T. only here, 
II Thess. 3:7, 9; Heb. 13:7. That which is evil (to kakon). 
“The bad,” as in Rom. 12:21 (neuter singular abstract). 
But that which is good (alla to agathon). “But the good.” 
As in Rom. 12:21 again. Probably by the contrast between 
Diotrephes and Demetrius. He that doeth good (ho agatho- ~ 
poidn). Articular present active participle of agathopoied, 
late and rare verb, in contrast with ho kakopoion (old and 
common verb) as in Mark 3:4; Luke 6:9; I Pet. 3:17. Js of 
God (ek tou theou estin). Asin I John 3:9f. Hath not seen 
God (ouch heoraken ton theon). As in I John 3:6. He 
does not say ek tou diabolou as Jesus does in John 8:44, but 
he means it. 

12. Demetrius hath the witness of all men (Démétriot memar- 
turétai hupo panton). Perfect passive indicative of martureo, 
“it has been witnessed to Demetrius (dative case) by all.” 
We know nothing else about him, unless, as is unlikely, he be 
identified with Demas as a shortened form (Philemon 24; 
Col. 4:4; II Tim. 4:10), who has come back after his desertion 
or with the Ephesian silversmith (Acts 19:21ff.), who may 
have been converted under John’s ministry, which one would 
like to believe, though there is no evidence for it. He may 
indeed be the bearer of this letter from Ephesus to Gaius and 
may also have come under suspicion for some reason and 
hence John’s warm commendation. And of the truth itself (kat 
hupo autés tés alétheias). A second commendation of Deme- 
trius. It is possible, in view of I John 5:6 (the Spirit is the 
truth), that John means the Holy Spirit and not a mere 


266 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


personification of the truth. Yea we also (kai hémeis de). A 
third witness to Demetrius, that is John himself (literary 
plural). Thou knowest (oidas). “The words in John 21:24 
sound like an echo of this sentence” (Westcott). John 
knew Demetrius well in Ephesus. 

13. I had (eichon). Imperfect active of echd, when I 
began to write (grapsai, ingressive aorist active infinitive of 
grapho). I am unwilling to write (ou thelo graphein). ‘1 do 
not wish to go on writing them. With ink and pen (dia 
melanos kai kalamou), ‘by means of (dia) black (ink) and 
reed (used as pen).” See II John 12 for melanos and Matt. 
11:7 for kalamos, used for papyrus and parchment, as 
grapheion (a sharp stilus) for wax tablets. 

14. I hope (elpizd)—We shall speak (lalésomen). Literary 
plural really singular like e/pizd. Face to face (stoma pros 
stoma). As in II John 12. 

15. Peace to thee (eirené soi). Pax tibi like the Jewish 
greeting shalom (Luke 10:5; 24:36; John 20:19, 21). The 
friends (hoi philoi). Those in Ephesus. By name (kat’ 
onoma). John knew the friends in the church (at Pergamum 
or wherever it was) as the good shepherd calls his sheep by 
name (John 10:3, the only other N.T. example of kag’ 
onoma). ‘The idiom is common in the papyri letters (Deiss- 
mann, Light, etc., p. 193, note 21).

BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 


DIFFICULTY IN THE PROBLEM 


Perhaps no single book in the New Testament presents so 
many and so formidable problems as the Apocalypse of John. 
These difficulties concern the authorship, the date, the 
apocalyptic method, the relation to the other Johannine 
books, the purpose, the historical environment, the reception 
of the book in the New Testament canon, the use and misuse 
of the book through the ages, etc. In the eastern churches 
the recognition of the Apocalypse of John was slower than 
in the west, since it was not in the Peshitta Syriac Version. 
Caius of Rome attributed the book to Cerinthus the Gnostic, 
but he was ably answered by Hippolytus, who attributed it 
to the Apostle John. The Council of Laodicea (about a.p. 
360) omitted it, but the third Council of Carthage (a.p. 397) 
accepted it. The dispute about millenarianism led Dionysius 
of Alexandria (middle of the third century, a.p.) to deny the 
authorship to the Apostle John, though he accepted it as 
canonical. Eusebius suggested a second John as the author. 
But finally the book was accepted in the east as Hebrews 
was in the west after a period of doubt. 


Poor STATE OF THE TEXT 


There are only five uncials that give the text of John’s 
Apocalypse (Aleph AC PQ). Of these Aleph belongs to the 
fourth century, A and C to the fifth, Q (really Bz, B ending 
with Heb. 9:13, both in the Vatican Library) to the eighth, 
P to the ninth. Only Aleph A Q (= B,) are complete, 
Crlacla nee sr 519 21955614507 FAH 17 5> 885-921 Og Os1OTI 13; 
14:13-18:2, 19:5-21, P lacking 16:12-17:1, 19:21-20:9, 

269 


270 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


22:6-21. Both C and P are palimpsests. In the 400 verses 
of the book ‘‘over 1,600 variants have been counted” 
(Moffatt). Erasmus had only one cursive (of the twelfth cen- 
tury numbered 1°) for his first edition, and the last six verses 
of the Apocalypse, save verse 20, were a translation from the 
Vulgate. The result is that the versions are of special im- 
portance for the text of the book, since in no single MS. or 
group of MSS. do we have a fairly accurate text, though 
Aleph A C and A C Vulgate are the best two groups. 


THE APOCALYPTIC STYLE 


The book claims to be an apocalypse (1:1) and has to be 
treated as such. It is an unveiling (apokalupsis, from 
apokalupto) or revelation of Jesus Christ, a prophecy, in 
other words, of a special type, like Ezekiel, Zechariah, and 
Daniel in the Old Testament. There was a considerable 
Jewish apocalyptic literature by this time when John wrote, 
much of it B.c., some of it a.D., like the Book of Enoch, the 
Apocalypse of Baruch, the Book of Jubilees, the Assumption 
of Moses, the Psalms of Solomon, the Testaments of the 
Twelve Patriarchs, the Sibylline Oracles, some of them evi- 
dently “worked over by Christian hands” (Swete). Jesus 
himself used the apocalyptic style at times (Mark 13 = Matt. 
24 and 25 =Luke 21). Paulin I Cor. 14 spoke of the unpre- 
meditated apocalyptic utterances in the Christian meetings 
and suggested restraints concerning them. “The Revela-_ 
tion of John is the only written apocalypse, as it is the only 
written prophecy of the Apostolic age. . . . The first Chris- 
tian apocalypse came on the crest of this long wave of 
apocalyptic effort” (Swete). The reason for this style of 
writing is usually severe persecution and the desire to deliver 
a message in symbolic form. The effort of Antiochus 
Epiphanes, who claimed to be “‘a god manifest,” to hellenize 
the Jews aroused violent opposition and occasioned many 
apocalypses to cheer the persecuted Jews.

Emperor Worsuip as THE Occasion FOR JOHN’s 
APOCALYPSE 


There is no doubt at all that the emperor cult (emperor 
worship) played a main part in the persecution of the 
Christians that was the occasion for this great Christian 
apocalypse. The book itself bears ample witness to this 
fact, if the two beasts refer to the Roman power as the 
agent of Satan. It is not possible to single out each in- 
dividual emperor in the graphic picture. Most would take 
the dragon to be Satan and the first and the second beasts 
to be the imperial and provincial Roman power. The 
Roman emperors posed as gods and did the work of Satan. 
In particular there were two persecuting emperors (Nero 
and Domitian) who were responsible for many martyrs for 
Christ. But emperor worship began before Nero. Julius 
Cesar was worshipped in the provinces. Octavius was called 
Augustus (Sedastos, Reverend). The crazy Emperor Caius 
Caligula not simply claimed to be divine, but actually de- 
manded that his statue be set up for worship in the Holy 
of Holies in the Temple in Jerusalem. He was killed in 
January a.p. 41 before he could execute his dire purpose. 
But the madcap Nero likewise demanded worship and 
blamed in a.p. 64 the burning of Rome on the Christians, 
though guilty of it himself. He set the style for persecuting 
Christians, which slumbered on and burst into flames again 
under Domitian, who had himself commonly termed Dom- 
inus ac Deus noster (Our Lord and God). The worship of 
the emperor did not disturb the worshippers of other gods 
save the Jews and the Christians, and in particular the 
Christians were persecuted after the burning of Rome when 
they were distinguished from the Jews. Up till then Chris- 
tians were regarded (as by Gallio in Corinth) as a variety 
of Jews and so entitled to tolerance as a religio licita, but 
they had no standing in law by themselves and their re- 


272 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


fusal to worship the emperor early gave offence, as Paul 
indicates in I Cor. 12:3. It was Kurios Ié@sous or Kurios 
Kaisar. On this very issue Polycarp lost his life. The em- 
perors as a rule were tolerant about it, save Nero and 
Domitian, who was called Nero redivivous, or Nero back 
again. Trajan in his famous letter to Pliny advised toler- 
ance except in stubborn cases, when the Christians had to 
be put to death. After Nero it was a crime to be a Chris- 
tian and all sorts of slanders about them were circulated. 
We have seen already in II Thess. 2:3ff., the man of sin 
who sets himself above God as the object of worship. We 
have seen also in I John 2:18, 22; 4:3; II John 7 the term 
antichrist applied apparently to Gnostic heretics. One may 
wonder if, as Beckwith argues, in the Apocalypse the man 
of sin and the antichrist are united in the beast. 


THe AUTHOR 


The writer calls himself John (1:1, 4, 9; 22:8). But what 
John? The book can hardly be pseudonymous, though, 
with the exception of the Shepherd of Hermas, that is the 
rule with apocalypses. There would have been a clearer 
claim than just the name. The traditional and obvious 
way to understand the name is the Apostle John, though 
Dionysius of Alexandria mentions John Mark as held by 
some and he himself suggests another John, like the so- 
called Presbyter John of Papias as quoted by Eusebius. 
The uncertain language of Papias has raised a deal of ques- 
tioning. Swete thinks that the majority of modern critics 
ascribe the Apocalypse to this Presbyter John, to whom 
Moffatt assigns probably II and II -John. Irenzus repre- 
sents the Apostle John as having lived to the time of Trajan, 
at least to a.D. 98. Most ancient writers agree with this 
extreme old age of John. Justin Martyr states expressly 
that the Apostle John wrote the Apocalypse. Irenzus called 
it the work of a disciple of Jesus. In the ninth century lived 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION a78 


Georgius Hamartolus, and a MS. of his alleges that Papias 
says that John the son of Zebedee was beheaded by the 
Jews and there is an extract in an Oxford MS. of the 
seventh century which alleges that Papias says John and 
James were put to death by the Jews. On the basis of this 
slim evidence some today argue that John did not live to 
the end of the century and so did not write any of the 
Johannine books. But a respectable number of modern 
scholars still hold to the ancient view that the Apocalypse 
of John is the work of the Apostle and Beloved Disciple, 
the son of Zebedee. 


RELATION TO THE FourTH GOSPEL 


Here scholars divide again. Many who deny the Johan- 
nine authorship of the Fourth Gospel and the Epistles ac- 
cept the apostolic authorship of the Apocalypse, Baur, for 
instance. Hort, Lightfoot, and Westcott argued for the 
Johannine authorship on the ground that the Apocalypse 
was written early (time of Nero or Vespasian) when John 
did not know Greek so well as when the Epistles and the 
Gospel were written. There are numerous grammatical 
laxities in the Apocalypse, termed by Charles a veritable 
grammar of its own. They are chiefly retention of the 
nominative case in appositional words or phrases, particu- 
larly participles, many of them sheer Hebraisms, many of 
them clearly intentional (as in Rev. 1:4), all of them on 
purpose according to Milligan (Revelation in Schaff’s Pop. 
Comm.) and Heinrici (Der Litterarische Charakter der neutest. 
Schriften, p. 85). Radermacher (Neutestamentliche Gram- 
matik, p. 3) calls it “the most uncultured literary production 
that has come down to us from antiquity,” and one finds 
frequent parallels to the linguistic peculiarities in later illit- 
erate papyri. J. H. Moulton (Grammar, Vol. II, Part I, 
Pp. 3) says: “Its grammar is perpetually stumbling, its idiom 
is that of a foreign language, its whole style that of a writer 


274 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


who neither knows nor cares for literary form.” But we 
shall see that the best evidence is for a date in Domitian’s 
reign and not much later than the Fourth Gospel. It is 
worth noting that in Acts 4:13 Peter and John are both 
termed by the Sanhedrin agrammatoi kai idiotai (unlettered 
and unofficial men). We have seen the possibility that II 
Peter represents Peter’s real style or at least that of a 
different amanuensis from Silvanus in I Pet. 5:12. It seems 
clear that the Fourth Gospel underwent careful scrutiny and 
possibly by the elders in Ephesus (John 21:24). If John 
wrote the Apocalypse while in Patmos and so away from 
Ephesus, it seems quite possible that here we have John’s 
own uncorrected style more than in the Gospel and Epistles. 
There is also the added consideration that the excitement 
of the visions played a part along with a certain element of 
intentional variations from normal grammatical sequence. 
An old man’s excitement would bring back his early style. 
There are numerous coincidences in vocabulary and style 


between the Fourth Gospel and the Apocalypse. 


Tue Unity oF THE APOCALYPSE 


Repeated efforts have been made to show that the Apoca- 
lypse of John is not the work of one man, but a series of 
Jewish and Christian apocalypses pieced together in a more 
or less bungling fashion. Spitta argued for this in 1889. 
Vischer was followed by Harnack in the view there was a | 
Jewish apocalypse worked over by a Christian. Gunkel 
(Creation and Chaos, 1895) argued for a secret apocalyptic 
tradition of Babylonian origin. In 1904 J. Weiss carried 
on the argument for sources behind the Apocalypse. Many 
of the Jewish apocalypses do show composite authorship. 
There was a current eschatology which may have been 
drawn on without its being a written source. It is in chap- 
ter 12 where the supposed Jewish source is urged more 
vigorously about the woman, the dragon, and the man 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 275 


child. There are no differences in language (vocabulary or 
grammar) that argue for varied sources. The author may 
indeed make use of events in the reign of Nero as well as 
in the reign of Domitian, but the essential unity of the book 
has stood the test of the keenest criticism. 


THE DaTE 


There are two chief theories, the Neronic, soon after 
Nero’s death, the other in the reign of Domitian. Irenzeus 
is quoted by Eusebius as saying expressly that the Apoca- 
lypse of John was written at the close of the reign of Domi- 
tian. This testimony is concurred in by Clement of Alex- 
andria, by Origen, by Eusebius, by Jerome. In harmony 
with this clear testimony the severity of the persecutions 
suit the later date better than the earlier one. There is, 
besides, in Rev. 17:11f. an apparent reference to the story 
that Nero would return again. The fifth king who is one 
of the seven is an eighth. There was a Nero legend, to be 
sure, that Nero either was not dead but was in Parthia, or 
would be redivivus after death. Juvenal termed Domitian 
“a bald Nero” and others called Domitian “a second Nero.” 
But in spite of all this Hort, Lightfoot, Sanday, Westcott 
have argued strongly for the Neronic era. Peake is willing 
to admit allusions to the Neronic period as Swete is also, 
but both consider the Domitianic date the best supported. 
Moffatt considers any earlier date than Domitian “almost 
impossible.” 


Tue VISIONS 


No theory of authorship, sources, or date should ignore 
the fact that the author claims to have had a series of visions 
in Patmos. It does not follow that he wrote them down at 
once and without reflection, but it seems hardly congruous 
to think that he waited till he had returned from exile in 
Patmos to Ephesus before writing them out. In fact, there 


276 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


is a note of sustained excitement all through the book, 
combined with high literary skill in the structure of the 
book in spite of the numerous grammatical lapses. The 
series of sevens bear a relation to one another, but more in 
the fashion of a kaleidoscope than of a chronological pano- 
rama. And yet there is progress and power in the arrange- 
ment and the total effect. There is constant use of Old 
Testament language and imagery, almost a mosaic, but 
without a single formal quotation. There is constant repeti- 
tion of words and phrases in true Johannine style. Each of 
the messages to the seven churches picks out a metaphor in 
the first picture of Christ in chapter 1 and there are frequent 
other allusions to the language in this picture. In fact 
there is genuine artistic skill in the structure of the book, 
in spite of the deflections from ordinary linguistic standards. 
In the visions and all through the book there is constant 
use of symbols, as is the fashion in apocalypses like the 
beasts, the scorpions, the horses, etc. These symbols prob- 
ably were understood by the first readers of the book, 
though the key to them is lost to us. Even the numbers in 
the book (314, 7, 3, 4, 12, 24, 1000) cannot be pressed, though 
some do so. Even Harnack called the Apocalypse the 
plainest book in the New Testament, by using Harnack’s 
key for the symbols. 


THEORIES OF INTERPRETATION 


They are literally many. There are those who make the 
book a chart of Christian and even of human history even 
to the end. These divide into two groups, the continuous 
and the synchronous. The continuous historical theory 
takes each vision and symbol in succession as an unfolding 
panorama. Under the influence of this theory there have 
been all sorts of fantastic identifications of men and events. 
The synchronous theory takes the series of sevens (seals, 
trumpets, bowls) as parallel with each other, each time 


BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION 277 


going up to the end. But in neither case can any satis- 
factory program be arranged. Another historical interpre- 
tation takes it all as over and done, the preterist theory. 
This theory again breaks into two, one finding the fulfil- 
ment all in the Neronic period, the other in the Domitianic 
era. Something can be said for each view, but neither satis- 
fies the whole picture by. any means. Roman Catholic 
scholars have been fond of the preterist view to escape the 
Protestant interpretation of the second beast in chapter 13 
as papal Rome. There is still another interpretation, the 
futurist, which keeps the fulfilment all in the future and 
which can be neither proved nor disproved. There is also 
the purely spiritual theory which finds no historical allusion 
anywhere. This again can be neither proved nor disproved. 
One of the lines of cleavage is the millennium in chapter 20. 
Those who take the thousand years literally are either pre- 
millennialists who look for the second coming of Christ to 
be followed by a thousand years of personal reign here on 
earth or the postmillennialists who place the thousand years 
before the second coming. There are others who turn to 
II Pet. 3:8 and wonder if, after all, in a book of symbols 
this thousand years has any numerical value at all. There 
seems abundant evidence to believe that this apocalypse, 
written during the stress and storm of Domitian’s persecu- 
tion, was intended to cheer the persecuted Christians with 
a view of certain victory at last, but with no scheme of 
history in view. 


A PractTicaAL PuRPOSE 


So considered, this vision of the Reigning Christ in heaven 
with a constant eye on the suffering saints and martyrs is a 
guarantee of certain triumph in heaven and ultimate triumph 
on earth. The picture of Christ in heaven is a glorious one. 
He is the Lamb that was slain, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, 
the Word of God, the Victor over his enemies, worshipped in 


278 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


heaven like the Father, the Light and Life of men. Instead 
of trying to fit the various symbols on particular individuals 
one will do better to see the same application to times of 
persecution from time to time through the ages. The 
same Christ who was the Captain of salvation in the time of 
Domitian is the Pioneer and Perfecter of our faith today. 
The Apocalypse of John gives glimpses of heaven as well as 
of hell. Hope is the word that it brings to God’s people at 


all times. 


THE READERS OF THE Book 


The whole book is sent to the seven churches in Asia (1:4). 
There is a special message to each of the seven (chapters 2 
and 3), suited to the peculiar needs of each church and witha 
direct reference to the geography and history of each church 
and city, so Ramsay holds (The Letters to the Seven Churches). 
The book is to be read aloud in each church (1:3). One can 
imagine the intense interest that the book would arouse in 
each church. Children are charmed to hear the Apocalypse 
read. They do not understand the symbols, but they see 
the pictures in the unfolding panorama. There were other 
churches in the Province of Asia besides these seven, but 
these form a circle from Ephesus where John had lived and 
wrought. They do present a variety of churches, not 
necessarily all types, and by no means a chart of seven dis- 
pensations of Christian history.

CHAPTER I 


1. The Revelation (apokalupsis). Late and rare word out- 
_ side of N.T. (once in Plutarch and so in the vernacular 
Koiné), only once in the Gospels (Luke 2:32), but in LXX 
and common in the Epistles (II Thess. 1:7), though only 
here in this book besides the title, from apokalupto, old verb, 
to uncover, to unveil. In the Epistles apokalupsis is used 
for insight into truth (Eph. 1:17) or for the revelation of 
God or Christ at the second coming of Christ (II Thess. 1:7; 
I Pet. 1:7). It is interesting to compare apokalupsis with 
epiphaneia (II Thess. 2:8) and phanerosis (I Cor. 12:7). The 
precise meaning here turns on the genitive following. Of 
Fesus Christ ([ésou Christou). Hort takes it as objective 
genitive (revelation about Jesus Christ), but Swete rightly 
argues for the subjective genitive because of the next clause. 
Gave him (edoken autoi). It is the Son who received the 
revelation from the Father, as is usual (John §:20f., 26, etc.). 
To shew (deixai). First aorist active infinitive of deiknumi, — 
purpose of God in giving the revelation to Christ. Unto his — 
servants (tois doulois autou). Believers in general and not 
just to officials. Dative case. God’s servants (or Christ’s). 
Must shortly come to pass (dei genesthai en tachei). Second 
aorist middle infinitive of ginomai with dei. See this same 
adjunct (en tachei) in Luke 18:8; Rom. 16:20; Rev. 22:6. 
It is a relative term to be judged in the light of II Pet. 3:8 
according to God’s clock, not ours. And yet undoubtedly 
the hopes of the early Christians looked for a speedy return 
of the Lord Jesus. This vivid panorama must be read in 
the light of that glorious hope and of the blazing fires of 
persecution from Rome. Sent and signified (es¢manen apos- 
teilas). ‘‘Having sent (first aorist active participle of apo- 
283 


284 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


stello, Matt. 10:16 and again in Rev. 22:6 of God sending 
his angel) signified” (first aorist active indicative of s@maind, 
from séma, sign or token, for which see John 12:33; Acts 
11:28). See 12:1 for sémeion, though sémaino (only here in 
the Apocalypse) suits admirably the symbolic character of 
the book. By his angel (dia tou aggelou autou). Christ’s 
angel as Christ is the subject of the verb es@manen, as in 
22:16 Christ sends his angel, though in 22:6 God sends. 
Unto his servant Fohn (toi douloi autou Idanei). Dative case. 
John gives his name here, though not in Gospel or Epistles, 
because “‘prophecy requires the guarantee of the individual 
who is inspired to utter it” (Milligan). ‘‘The genesis of the 
Apocalypse has now been traced from its origin in the Mind 
of God to the moment when it reached its human inter- 
preter” (Swete). ‘‘Jesus is the medium of all revelation” 
(Moffatt). 

2. Bare witness (emarturésen). First aorist active indica- 
tive of martured, which, along with martus and marturia, is 
common in all the Johannine books (cf. 22:18, 20), usually 
with peri or hoti, but with cognate accusative as here in 
22:16, 20; I John 5:10. Epistolary aorist here, referring to 
this book. The word of God (ton logon tou theou). Subjective 
genitive, given by God. The prophetic word as in 1:9; 6:9; 
20:4, not the personal Word as in 19:14. The testimony of 
Jesus Christ (tén marturian Tsou Christou). Subjective gen- 
itive again, borne witness to by Jesus Christ. Even of all 
the things that he saw (hosa eiden). Relative clause in appo- 
sition with Jogon and marturian. 

3. Blessed (makarios). As in Matt. 5:3ff. This endorses 
the book as a whole. He that readeth (ho anaginoskon). 
Present active singular articular participle of anagindsko (as 
in Luke 4:16). Christians in their public worship followed 
the Jewish custom of public reading of the Scriptures (II 
Cor, 3:14f.). The church reader (anagndstés, lector) gradu- 
ally acquired an official position. John expects this book to 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 285 


be read in each of the seven churches mentioned (1:4) and 
elsewhere. Today the public reading of the Bible is an 
important part of worship that is often poorly done. They 
that hear (hot akouontes). Present active plural articular 
participle of akoud (the audience). And keep (kai térountes). 
Present active participle of #@red, a common Johannine word 
(I John 2:4, etc.). Cf. Matt. 7:24. ‘‘The content of the 
Apocalypse is not merely prediction; moral counsel and re- 
ligious instruction are the primary burdens of its pages” 
(Moffatt). Written (gegrammena). Perfect passive parti- 
ciple of grapho. For the time is at hand (ho gar kairos eggus). 
Reason for listening and keeping. On kairos see Matt. 12:1, 
time of crisis as in I Cor. 7:29. How near eggus (at hand) 
is we do not know any more than we do about en tachei 
(shortly) in 1:1. 

4. To the seven churches which are in Asia (tais hepta ekkle- 
siais tais en tei Asiai). Dative case as in a letter (Gal. 1:1). 
John is writing, but the revelation is from God and Christ 
through an angel. It is the Roman province of Asia which 
included the western part of Phrygia. There were churches 
also at Troas (Acts 20:5ff.) and at Colossz and Hierapolis 
(Col.-1:1; 2:1; 4:13) and possibly at Magnesia and Tralles. 
But these seven were the best points of communication with 
seven districts (Ramsay) and, besides, seven is a favorite 
number of completion (like the full week) in the book (1:4, 12, 
163 4353 §:1, 6; 8:25 10:33 11:13; 12:3; 13:1; 14:6f.). From 
him which is (apo ho Gn). This use of the articular nomina- 
tive participle of eimi after apo instead of the ablative is not 
due to ignorance or a mere slip (/apsus pennae), for in the 
next line we have the regular idiom with apo ton hepta 
pneumaton. It is evidently on purpose to call attention to 
the eternity and unchangeableness of God. Used of God in 
Ex. 3:14. And which was (kai ho én). Here again there is 
a deliberate change from the articular participle to the rela- 
tive use of o (used in place of hos to preserve identity of 


286 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


form in the three instances like Ionic relative and since no 
aorist participle of eimi existed). The oracle in Pausanias 
X. 12 has it: Zeus én, Zeus esti, Zeus essetai (Zeus was, Zeus 
is, Zeus will be). Which is to come (ho erchomenos). “The 
Coming One,” futuristic use of the present participle instead 
of ho esomenos. See the same idiom in verse 8 and 4:8 and 
(without ho erchomenos) in 11:17; 16:5. From the seven 
Spirits (apo ton hepta pneumaton). A difficult symbolic rep- 
resentation of the Holy Spirit here on a par with God and 
Christ, a conclusion borne out by the symbolic use of the 
seven spirits in 3:1; 4:5; 5:6 (from Zech. 4:2-10). There is 
the one Holy Spirit with seven manifestations here to the 
seven churches (Swete, The Holy Spirit in the N.T., p. 374), 
unity in diversity (I Cor. 12:4). Which are (ton article 
Aleph A, ha relative P). Before his throne (endpion tou 
thronou autou). As in 4:6f. 

5. Who ts the faithful witness (ho martus ho pistos). “The 
witness the faithful,” nominative in apposition like proto- 
tokos and archon with the preceding ablative Jésou Christou 
with apo, a habit of John in this book (apparently on pur- 
pose) as in 2:13, 20; 3:12, etc. See this same phrase in 2:13; 
3:14. The use of martus of Jesus here is probably to the 
witness (1:1) in this book (22:16f.), not to the witness of 
Jesus before Pilate (I Tim. 6:13). The first-born of the dead 
(ho prototokos ton nekron). A Jewish Messianic title (Ps. 
88:28) and as in Col. 1:18 refers to priority in the resurrec- 
tion to be followed by others. See Luke 2:7 for the word. 
The ruler of the kings of the earth (ho archin ton basileon ts 
gés). Jesus by his resurrection won lordship over the kings 
of earth (17:14; 19:16), what the devil offered him by sur- 
render (Matt. 4:8f.). Unto him that loveth us (t0i agaponti 
hémas). Dative of the articular present (not aorist agapé- 
santi) active participle of agapad in a doxology to Christ, 
the first of many others to God and to Christ (1:6; GEL eStgy 
12f.; 7:10, 12, etc.). For the thought see John 3:16. Loosed 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 287 


(Jusanti). First aorist active participle of /ud (Aleph A C), 
though some MSS. (P Q) read /ousanti (washed), a manifest 
correction. Note the change of tense. Christ loosed us once 
for all, but loves us always. By his blood (en toi haimati 
autou). Asin §:9. John here as in the Gospel and Epistles 
states plainly and repeatedly the place of the blood of 
Christ in the work of redemption. 

6. And he made (kai epoiésen). Change from the par- 
ticiple construction, which would be kai poiésanti (first 
aorist active of poied) like /usanti just before, a Hebraism 
Charles calls it, but certainly an anacoluthon of which John 
is very fond, as in 1:18; 2:2, 9, 20; 3:95 7:14; 14:2f.5 15:3. 
Kingdom (basileian). So correctly Aleph A C, not dasilets 
(P cursives). Perhaps a reminiscence of Ex. 19:6, a kingdom 
of priests. In 5:10 we have again “a kingdom and priests.” 
The idea here is that Christians are the true spiritual Israel 
in God’s promise to Abraham as explained by Paul in Gal. 
3 and Rom. 9. To be priests (hiereis). In apposition with 
basileian, but with kai (and) in 5:10. Each member of this 
true kingdom is a priest unto God, with direct access to 
him at all times. Unto his God and Father (toi theoi kat 
patri autou). Dative case and autou (Christ) applies to 
both thedi and patri. Jesus spoke of the Father as his God 
(Matt. 27:46; John 20:17) and Paul uses like language (Eph. 
1:17), as does Peter (I Pet. 1:3). To him (autoi). Another 
doxology to Christ. ‘The adoration of Christ which vi- 
brates in this doxology is one of the most impressive fea- 
tures of the book” (Moffatt). Like doxologies to Christ 
appear in 5:13; 7:10; I Pet. 4:11; II Pet. 3:18; Il Tim. 4:18; 
Heb. 13:21. These same words (hé doxa kai to kratos) in 
I Pet. 4:11, only Aé doxa in II Pet. 3:18 and IL Tim. 4:18, 
but with several others in Rev. 5:13 and 7:10. 

7. Behold, he cometh with the clouds (idou erchetai meta ton 
nephelon). Futuristic present middle indicative of erchomai, 
a reminiscence of Dan. 7:13 (Theodotion). “It becomes a 


288 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


common eschatological refrain” (Beckwith) as in Mark 
13:26; 14:62; Matt. 24:30; 26:64; Luke 21:27. ‘‘Compare 
the manifestation of God in the clouds at Sinai, in the cloudy 
pillar, the Shekinah, at the transfiguration” (Vincent). Shall 
see (opsetai). Future middle of horad, a reminiscence of 
Zech. 12:10 according to the text of Theodotion (Aquila 
and Symmachus) rather than the LXX and like that of 
Matt. 24:30 (similar combination of Daniel and Zechariah) 
and 26:64. This picture of the victorious Christ in his 
return occurs also in 14:14, 18-20; I9:11-21; 20:7-10. And 
they which (kai hoitines). “And the very ones who,” Romans 
and Jews, all who shared in this act. Pierced (exekentésan). 
First aorist active indicative of ekkented, late compound 
(Aristotle, Polybius, LXX), from ek and kented (to stab, to 
pierce), in N.T., only here and John 19:37, in both cases 
from Zech. 12:10, but not the LXX text (apparently proof 
that John used the original Hebrew or the translation of 
Theodotion and Aquila). Shall mourn (kopsontai). Future 
middle (direct) of koptd, old verb, to cut, “they shall cut 
themselves,” as was common for mourners (Matt. Liskz3 
Luke 8:52; 23:27). From Zech. 12:12. See also Rev. 18:9. 
Tribes (phulai). Not just the Jewish tribes, but the spiritual 
Israel of Jews and Gentiles as in 7:4-8. No nation had then 
accepted Christ as Lord and Saviour, nor has any yet 
done so. 

8. The Alpha and the Omega (to Alpha kai to 0). The 
first and the last letters of the Greek alphabet, each with 
its own neuter (grammatical gender) article. This descrip- 
tion of the eternity of God recurs in 21:6 with the added 
explanation hé arché kai to telos (the Beginning and the End) 
and of Christ in 22:13 with the still further explanation ho 
protos kai ho eschatos (the First and the Last). This last 
phrase appears also in 1:17 and 2:8 without fo Alpha kai 
to O. The change of speaker here is unannounced, as in 
16:15; 18:20. Only here and a1:sf. is God introduced as 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 289 


the speaker. The eternity of God guarantees the prophecy 
just made. The Lord God (Kurios ho theos). ‘‘The Lord 
the God.”” Common phrase in Ezekiel (6:3, 11; 7:2, etc.) 
and in this book (4:8; 11:17; 15:3; 16:7; 19:6; 21:22). See 
1:4 and 4:8 for the triple use of ho, etc. to express the 
eternity of God. The Almighty (ho pantokrator). Late com- 
pound (pas and krated), in Cretan inscription and a legal 
papyrus, common in LXX and Christian papyri, in N.T. 
only in II Cor. 6:18 (from Jer. 38:35) and Rev. 1:85; 4:8; 
ERE PS WSepetbeps Laprigths.0 551212202) 

g. I Fohn (Ego Ioanés). So 22:8. In apocalyptic litera- 
ture the personality of the writer is always prominent to 
guarantee the visions (Dan. 8:1; 10:2). Partaker with you 
(sunkoinonos). See already I Cor. 9:23. “‘Co-partner with 
you” (Rom. 11:17). One article with adelphos and sun- 
koinénos unifying the picture. The absence of apostolos 
here does not show that he is not an apostle, but merely his 
self-effacement, as in the Fourth Gospel, and still more his 
oneness with his readers. So there is only one article (¢é) 
with shlipsei (tribulation), basileiai (kingdom), hupomonéi 
(patience), ideas running all through the book. Both the 
tribulation (see Matt. 13:21 for ¢hlipsis) and the kingdom 
(see Matt. 3:2 for dasileia) were present realities and called 
for patience (hupomoné being “the spiritual alchemy” ac- 
cording to Charles for those in the kingdom, for which see 
Luke 8:15; James 5:7). All this is possible only “in Jesus”’ 
(en Iésou), a phrase on a par with Paul’s common ex 
Christoi (in Christ), repeated in 14:13. Cf. 3:20 and II 
Thess. 3:5. Was (egenomén). Rather, “I came to be,” 
second aorist middle indicative of ginomai. In the isle that 
is called Patmos (en téi nésoi tei kaloumenét Patmoi). Patmos 
is a rocky sparsely settled island some ten miles long and 
half that wide, one of the Sporades group in the Aigean 
Sea, south of Miletus. The present condition of the island 
is well described by W. E. Geil in The Isle That Is Called 


290 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Patmos (1905). Here John saw the visions described in the 
book, apparently written while still a prisoner there in exile. 
For the word of God and the testimony of Fesus (dia ton logon 
tou theou kat ten marturian Iésou). The reason for (dia and 
the-accusative) John’s presence in Patmos, naturally as a 
result of persecution already alluded to, not for the purpose 
of preaching there or of receiving the visions. See verse 2 
for the phrase. 

10. [ was in the Spirit (egenomén en pneumati). Rather, 
“I came to be (as in 1:9) in the Spirit,” came into an ec- 
static condition as in Acts 1o:1of.; 22:17, not the normal 
spiritual condition (einai en pneumati, Rom. 8:9). On the 
Lord’s Day (en tei kuriakéi hémerai). Deissmann has proven 
(Bible Studies, p. 217f.; Light, etc., P- 357ff.) from inscrip- 
tions and papyri that the word kuriakos was in common 
use for the sense “imperial” as imperial finance and im- 
perial treasury and from papyri and ostraca that Aémera 
Sebasté (Augustus Day) was the first day of each month, 
Emperor’s Day on which money payments were made (cf. 
I Cor. 16:1f.). It was easy, therefore, for the Christians to 
take this term, already in use, and apply it to the first day 
of the week in honour of the Lord Jesus Christ’s resurrection 
on that day (Didache 14, Ignatius Magn. 9). In the N.T. 
the word occurs only here and I Cor. 11:20 (kuriakon deipnon 
the Lord’s Supper). It has no reference to Aémera kuriou 
(the day of judgment, II Pet. 3:10). Behind me (opisd 
mou). “The unexpected, overpowering entrance of the 
divine voice” (Vincent). Cf. Ezek. 3:12. Voice (phonén). 
Of Christ, as is plain in verses 12f. As of a trumpet (hos 
salpiggos). So in 4:1 referring to this. Saying (degousés). 
Present active participle genitive case agreeing with salpiggos 
rather than /egousan, accusative agreeing with phonéen. So 
on purpose, as is clear from 4:1, where /alousés also agrees 
with salpiggos. 

11, Write in a book (grapson eis biblion). First aorist ac- 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 2gt 


tive imperative of graphd for instantaneous action. The 
commission covers the whole series of visions which all grow 
out of this first vision of the Risen Christ. Send (pempson). 
First aorist active imperative of pempd. Part of the com- 
mission from Christ.. The names of the seven churches of 
1:4 are now given, and the particular message to each church 
comes in chapters 2 and 3 and in the same order, the geo- 
graphical order going north from Ephesus, then east and 
south to Laodicea. But apparently the whole book was to 
be read to each of the seven churches. It would probably 
also be copied at each church. 

12. To see the voice (blepein ten phonén). The voice put - 
for the person speaking. Having turned (epistrepsas). First 
aorist active participle of epistrephd, from which also epes- 
trepsa, just before, for which verb see Acts 15:36; 16:18, 
Seven golden candlesticks (hepta luchnias chrusas). See Matt. 
5:15 for /uchnia (lampstand). Symbols of the seven churches 
as explained in verse 20. See Ex. 25:35ff. for description 
of a seven-branched candlestick, but here the lampstands 
are separate. 

13. One like unto a son of man (homoion huion anthropou). 
Note accusative here with homoion (object of eidon) as in 
14:14 and not the associative-instrumental as is usual (1:15; 
4:3, 6). Charles holds that homoion here has the sense of hés 
(as) and compares 4:6 with 22:1 for proof. The absence of 
the article here shows also (Charles) that the idea is not 
“like the Son of man” for Christ is the Son of man. He is 
like ‘‘a son of man,” but nota man. Clothed (endedumenon). 
Perfect passive participle of endud, accusative case agreeing 
with homoion. A garment down to the foot (podéré). Old 
adjective podérés (from pous, foot, and aird), here only in 
N.T., accusative singular retained with the passive par- 
ticiple as often with verbs of clothing. Supply chitona or 
esthéta (garment). Girt about (periezodsmenon). Perfect pas- 
sive participle of perizonnumi, accusative singular agreeing 


292 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


with homoion. At the breasts (pros tois mastois). Old word 
for breasts of a woman (Luke 11:27; 23:29) and nipples of 
aman, as here. High girding like this was a mark of dignity 
as of the high priest (Josephus, 4nt. III. 7. 2). For pros 
with the locative see Mark 5:11. With a golden girdle 
(zonén chrusan). Accusative case again retained with the 
passive participle (verb of clothing). Note also chrusan 
(vernacular Koiné) rather than the old form, chrusén. 

14. 4s white wool (hos erion leukon). Erion (wool) in 
N.T. only here and Heb. 9:19, though old word. The per- 
son of the Lord Jesus is here described in language largely 
from Dan. 7:9 (the Ancient of Days). White as snow (hos 
chin). Just “as snow,” also in Dan. 7:9. In N.T. only 
here and Matt. 28:3. 4s a flame of fire (hos phlox puros). 
In Dan. 7:9 the throne of the Ancient of Days is phlox puros, 
while in Dan. 10:6 the eyes of the Ancient of Days are 
lampades puros (lamps of fire). See also 2:18 and 19:12 for 
this bold metaphor (like Heb. 1:7). 

15. Burnished brass (chalkolibanoi). Associative-instru- 
mental case after homoioi. This word has so far been found 
nowhere else save here and 2:18. Suidas defines it as an 
élecktron (amber) or a compound of copper and gold and 
silver (aurichalcum in the Latin Vulgate). It is in reality 
an unknown metal. ds if it had been refined (hos pepuro- 
menés). Perfect passive participle of purod, old verb, to 
set on fire, to glow, as in Eph. 6:16; Rev. 3:18. The fem- - 
inine gender shows that 4é chalkolibanos is referred to with 
tes chalkolibanou understood, for it does not agree in case 
with the associative-instrumental chalkolibandi just before. 
Some would call it a slip for pepuromendi as Aleph, and some 
cursives have it (taking chalkolibandi to be neuter, not 
feminine). But P Q read pepurdmenoi (masculine plural), 
a correction, making it agree in number and gender with 
podes (feet). In a furnace (en kamindi). Old word, in 
N.T. also 9:2; Matt. 13:42, 50. 4s the voice of many waters 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 293 


(hos phoné hudatoin polloin). So the voice of God in the 
Hebrew (not the LXX) of Ezek. 43:2. Repeated in 14:2; 
19:6. : 
16. And he had (kai echon). “And having,” present ac- 
tive participle of echd, loose use of the participle (almost like 
eiche, imperfect) and not in agreement with autou, genitive 
case. This is a common idiom in the book; a Hebraism, 
Charles calls it. In his right hand (en téi dexidi cheiri). For 
safe keeping as in John 10:28. Seven stars (asteras hepta). 
Symbols of the seven churches (verse 20), seven planets 
rather than Pleiades or any other constellation like the 
bear. Proceeded (ekporeuomené). Present middle participle - 
of ekporeuomai, old compound (Matt. 3:5) used loosely 
again like echon. A sharp two-edged sword (romphaia dis- 
tomos oxeia). “A sword two-mouthed sharp.” Romphaia 
(as distinct from machaira) is a long sword, properly a 
Thracian javelin, in N.T. only Luke 2:35 and Rev. 1:16; 
2:12; Heb. 4:12. See stoma used with machairés in Luke 
21:24 (by the mouth of the sword). Countenance (opsis). 
Old word (from op#d), in N.T. only here, John 7:24; 11:44. 
As the sun shineth (hos ho hélios phainei). Brachylogy, “as 
the sun when it shines.” For phainei see John 1:5. 

17. I fell (epesa). Late form for the old epeson (second 
aorist active indicative of piptd, to fall). Under the over- 
powering influence of the vision as in 19:10. He laid (eth- 
éken). First aorist active indicative of ‘ithémi. The act 
restored John’s confidence. Fear not (mé phobou). Cf. 
Luke 1:13 to Zacharias to give comfort. J am the first and 
the last (ego eimi ho protos kai ho eschatos). Used in Is. 
44:6 and 48:12 of God, but here, 2:8; 22:13 of Christ. dnd 
the Living One (kai ho zon). Present active articular par- 
ticiple of za0, another epithet of God common in the O.T. 
(Deut. 32:40; Is. 49:18, etc.) and applied purposely to 
Jesus, with which see John 5:26 for Christ’s own words 
about it. 


294 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


18. And I was dead (kai egenomén nekros). “And I be- 
came dead” (aorist middle participle of ginomai as in 1:9, 
10, definite reference to the Cross). J am alive (zon eimi). 
Periphrastic present active indicative, “I am living,” as 
the words ho zon just used mean. Forevermore (eis tous 
aionas ton aidnon). “‘Unto the ages of the ages,” a stronger 
expression of eternity even than in 1:6. The keys (tas kleis). 
One of the forms for the accusative plural along with 
kleidas, the usual one (Matt. 16:19). Of death and of Hades 
(tou thanatou kai tou haidou). Conceived as in Matt. 16:18 
as a prison house or walled city. The keys are the symbol 
of authority, as we speak of honouring one by giving him 
the keys of the city. Hades here means the unseen world 
to which death is the portal. Jesus has the keys because of 
his victory over death. See this same graphic picture in 
6:8; 20:13f. For the key of David see 3:7, for the key of 
the abyss see 9:1; 20:1. 

19. Therefore (oun). In view of Christ’s words about 
himself in verse 18 and the command in verse 11. Which 
thou sawest (ha eides). The vision of the Glorified Christ 
in verses 13-18. The things which are (ha eisin). Plural 
verb (individualising the items) though 4a is neuter plural, 
certainly the messages to the seven churches (1:20 to 3:22) 
in relation to the world in general, possibly also partly 
epexegetic or explanatory of ha eides. The things which 
shall come to pass hereafter (ha mellei ginesthai meta tauta). ~ 
Present middle infinitive with me//ei, though both aorist and 
future are also used. Singular verb here (mellei) blending in 
a single view the future. In a rough outline this part begins 
in 4:1 and goes to end of chapter 22, though the future ap- 
pears also in chapters 2 and 3 and the present occurs in 
4 to 22 and the elements in the vision of Christ (1:13-18) 
reappear repeatedly. 

20. The mystery of the seven stars (to musterion ton hepta 
asteron). On the word mustérion see on Matt. 13:11; II 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 295 


Thess. 2:7; Col. 1:26. Here it means the inner meaning 
(the secret symbol) of a symbolic vision (Swete) as in 10:7; 
13:18; 17:7, 9 and Dan. 2:47. Probably the accusative ab- 
solute (Charles), “as for the mystery” (Robertson, Gram- 
mar, pp. 490, 1130), .as in Rom. 8:3. This item is picked 
out of the previous vision (1:16) as needing explanation at 
once and as affording a clue to what follows (2:1, 5). Which 
(hous). Masculine accusative retained without attraction 
to case of asteroén (genitive, hon). In my right hand (epi 
tés dexias mou). Or “‘upon,” but em /éi, etc., in verse 16. 
And the seven golden candlesticks (kai tas hepta luchnias tas 
chrusas). “‘The seven lampstands the golden,” identifying ~ 
the stars of verse 16 with the lampstands of verse 12. The 
accusative case here is even more peculiar than the accusa- 
tive absolute mustérion, since the genitive /uchnion after 
mustérion is what one would expect. Charles suggests that 
John did not revise his work. The angels of the seven 
churches (aggeloi ton hepta ekklesion). Anarthrous in the 
predicate (angels of, etc.). ‘“‘The seven churches” men- 
tioned in 1:4, 11. Various views of agge/os here exist. The 
simplest is the etymological meaning of the word as mes- 
senger from agge//d (Matt. 11:10) as messengers from the 
seven churches to Patmos or by John from Patmos to the 
churches (or both). Another view is that aggelos is the 
pastor of the church, the reading tén gunaika sou (thy wife) 
in 2:20 (if genuine) confirming this view. Some would even 
take it to be the bishop over the elders as episcopos in Igna- 
tius, but a separate agge/os in each church is against this 
idea. Some take it to be a symbol for the church itself or 
the spirit and genius of the church, though distinguished in 
this very verse from the churches themselves (the lamp- 
stands). Others take it to be the guardian angel of each 
church assuming angelic patrons to be taught in Matt. 
18:10; Acts 12:15. Each view is encompassed with diffi- 
culties, perhaps fewer belonging to the view that the “angel” 


296 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


is the pastor. Are seven churches (hepta ekklésiai eisin). 
These seven churches (1:4, 11) are themselves lampstands 
(1:12) reflecting the light of Christ to the world (Matt. 
5:14-16; John 8:12) in the midst of which Christ walks 
(i233), 


CHAPTER II 


1. In Ephesus (en Ephesoi). Near the sea on the river 
Cayster, the foremost city of Asia Minor, the temple-keeper 
of Artemis and her wonderful temple (Acts 19:35), the home 
of the magic arts (Ephesian letters, Acts 19:19) and of the 
mystery-cults, place of Paul’s three years’ stay (Acts I9:1— 
10; 20:17-38), where Aquila and Priscilla and Apollos la- 
boured (Acts 18:24-28), where Timothy wrought (I and II . 
Tim.), where the Apostle John preached in his old age. 
Surely it was a place of great privilege, of great preaching. 
It was about sixty miles from Patmos and the messenger 
would reach Ephesus first. It is a free city, a seat of pro- 
consular government (Acts 19:38), the end of the great road 
from the Euphrates. The port was a place of shifting sands, 
due to the silting up of the mouth of the Cayster. Ramsay 
(Letters to the Seven Churches, p. 210) calls it “the City of 
Change.” These things (tade). This demonstrative seven 
times here, once with the message to each church (2:1, 8, 
12, 18; 2:1, 7, 14), only once elsewhere in N.T. (Acts 21:11). 
He that holdeth (ho kraton). Present active articular parti- 
ciple of krated, a stronger word than echdn in 1:16, to which 
it refers. He that walketh (ho peripaton). Present active 
articular participle of peripated, an allusion to 1:13. These 
two epithets are drawn from the picture of Christ in 1:13-18, 
and appropriately to conditions in Ephesus describe Christ’s 
power over the churches as he moves among them. 

2. I know (oida). Rather than gindsko and so “‘empha- 
sizes better the absolute clearness of mental vision which 
photographs all the facts of life as they pass” (Swete). So 
also in 2:9, 13, 19; 3:1, 8, 15. For the distinction see John 
21:17, “where the universal knowledge passes into the field 

297 


298 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


of special observation.” Works (erga). The whole life and 
conduct as in John 6:29. And thy toil and patience (kai ton 
kopon kai ten hupomonén sou). “Both thy toil and patience,” 
in.explanation of erga, and see I Thess. 1:3, where all three 
words (ergon, kopos, hupomoné) occur together as here. See 
14:13 for sharp distinction between erga (activities) and 
kopot (toils, with weariness). Endurance (hupomoné) in 
hard toil (kopos). And that (kai hoti). Further explanation 
of kopos (hard toil). Not able (ou dunéi). This Koiné form 
for the Attic dunasai (second person singular indicative 
middle) occurs also in Mark 9:22; Luke 16:2. Bear (basta- 
sat). First aorist active infinitive of dastazd, for which verb 
see John 10:31; 12:6; Gal. 6:2. These evil men were indeed 
a heavy burden. And didst try (kai epeirasas). First aorist 
active indicative of peirazd, to test, a reference to a recent 
crisis when these Nicolaitans (verse 6) were condemned. 
The present tenses (dunéi, echeis) indicate the continuance 
of this attitude. Cf. I John 4:1. Which call themselves 
apostles (tous legontas heautous apostolous). Perhaps itin- 
erant missionaries of these Nicolaitans who posed as equal 
to or even superior to the original apostles, like the Judaizers 
so described by Paul (II Cor. 11:5, 13; 12:11). Paul had 
foretold such false teachers (Gnostics), grievous wolves, in 
Acts 20:29; in sheep’s clothing, Jesus had said (Matt. yeceys 
And they are not (kai ouk eisin). A parenthesis in Johannine 
style (John 2:9; 3:9; I John 3:1) for kai ouk ontas to corre. - 
spond to /egontas. And didst find (kai heures). Second 
aorist active indicative of heurisko. Dropping back to the 
regular structure parallel with epeirasas. False (pseudeis). 
Predicate accusative plural of pseudés, self-deceived deceiv- 
ers as in 21:8. 

3- Thou hast (echeis). Continued possession of patience. 
Didst bear (ebastasas). First aorist indicative of bastazo, re- 
peated reference to the crisis in verse 2. And hast not grown 
weary (kai ou kekopiakes). Perfect active indicative of 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 299 


kopiaé, old verb, to grow weary (Matt. 6:28), play on the 
word kopos, late form in -es, for the regular -as (/elukas). 
like aphékes (verse 4) and peptokes (verse 5). “Tired in 
loyalty, not of it. The Ephesian church can bear anything 
except the presence: of impostors in her membership” 
(Moffatt). 

4. This against thee, that (kata sou hoti). For the phrase 
“have against” see Matt. 5:23. The Aofi clause is the object 
of echd. Thou didst leave (aphekes). First aorist active 
(kappa aorist, but with -es instead of -as) of aphiemi, a defi- 
nite and sad departure. Thy first love (tén agapén sou ten 
proten). “Thy love the first.” This early love, proof of © 
the new life in Christ (I John 3:13f.), had cooled off in spite 
of their doctrinal purity. They had remained orthodox, 
but had become unloving partly because of the controversies 
with the Nicolaitans. 

5. Remember (mnémoneue). Present active imperative of 
mnemoneud, “continue mindful” (from mnémoin). Thou art 
fallen (peptokes). Perfect active indicative of pipta, state of 
completion. Down in the valley, look up to the cliff where 
pure love is and whence thou hast fallen down. And repent 
(kai metanoéson). First aorist active imperative of metanoed, 
urgent appeal for instant change of attitude and conduct 
before it is too late. And do (kai poiéson). First aorist 
active imperative of poied, “Do at once.” The first works 
(ta prota erga). Including the first love (Acts 19:20; 20:37; 
Eph. 1:3ff.) which has now grown cold (Matt. 24:12). Or 
else (ei de mé). Elliptical condition, the verb not expressed 
(metanoeis), a common idiom, seen again in verse 16, the 
condition expressed in full by ean mé in this verse and verse 
22. I come (erchomai). Futuristic present middle (John 
14:2f.). To thee (soi). Dative, as in 2:16 also. Will move 
(kinéso). Future active of kined. In Ignatius’ Epistle to 
Ephesus it appears that the church heeded this warning. 
Except thou repent (ean mé metanoésétis). Condition of third 


300 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


class with ean mé instead of ei mé above, with the first 
aorist active subjunctive of metanoeo. 

6. That thou hatest (hoti miseis). Accusative object clause 
in apposition with foufo (this). Trench tells of the words 
used in ancient Greek for hatred of evil (misoponéria) and 
misoponeéros (hater of evil), neither of which occurs in the 
N.T., but which accurately describe the angel of the church 
in Ephesus. Of the Nicolaitans (ton Nikolaiton). Mentioned 
again in verse 15 and really meant in verse 2. Irenzeus and 
Hippolytus take this sect to be followers of Nicolaus of 
Antioch, one of the seven deacons (Acts 6:5), a Jewish 
proselyte, who is said to have apostatized. There was such 
a sect in the second century (Tertullian), but whether de- 
scended from Nicolaus of Antioch is not certain, though 
possible (Lightfoot). It is even possible that the Balaamites 
of verse 14 were a variety of this same sect (verse 15). 
Which I also hate (ha kago miso). Christ himself hates the 
teachings and deeds of the Nicolaitans (Aa, not hous, deeds, 
not people), but the church in Pergamum tolerated them. 

7. He that hath an ear (ho echon ous). An individualizing 
note calling on each of the hearers (1:3) to listen (2:7, 11, 
17, 28; 3:3, 6, 13, 22) and a reminiscence of the words of 
Jesus in the Synoptics (Matt. 11:15; 13:9, 43; Mark 4:9, 
23; Luke 8:8; 14:35), but not in John’s Gospel. The spirit 
(to pneuma). The Holy Spirit as in 14:13; 22:17. Both 
Christ and the Holy Spirit deliver this message. ‘The’ 
Spirit of Christ in the prophet is the interpreter of Christ’s 
voice” (Swete). To him that overcometh (toi nikonti). Da- 
tive of the present (continuous victory) active articular par- 
ticiple of nikad, a common Johannine verb (John 16:33; 
I John 2:13f.; 4:4; §:4f.; Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21; 
$353 12:11; 15:2; 17:14; 21:7). Faith is dominant in Paul, 
victory in John, faith is victory (I John 5:4). So in each 
promise to these churches. J will give (dosd). Future ac- 
tive of diddmi as in 2:10, 17, 23, 26, 28; 3:8, 21; 6:4; DPEZs 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 301 


21:6. To eat (phagein). Second aorist active infinitive of 
esthio. Of the tree of life (ek tou xulou tés 2dés). Note ek 
with the ablative with phagein, like our “eat of” (from or 
part of). From Gen. 2:9; 3:22. Again in Rev. 22:2, 14 as 
here for immortality. . This tree is now in the Garden of 
God. For the water of life see 21:6; 22:17 (Cf. John 4:10, 
13f.). Which (ho). The xulon (tree). In the Paradise of 
God (en toi paradeisoi tou theou). Persian word, for which 
see Luke 23:43; II Cor. 12:4. The abode of God and the 
home of the redeemed with Christ, not a mere intermediate 
state. It was originally a garden of delight and finally 
heaven itself (Trench), as here. 

8. In Smyrna (en Smurnéi). North of Ephesus, on a gulf 
of the Agean, one of the great cities of Asia (province), a 
seat of emperor-worship with temple to Tiberius, with many 
Jews hostile to Christianity who later join in the martyrdom 
of Polycarp, poor church (rich in grace) which receives only 
praise from Christ, scene of the recent massacre of Greeks 
by the Turks. Ramsay (op. cit., p. 251) terms Smyrna “‘the 
City of Life.” Christianity has held on here better than 
in any city of Asia. The first and the last (ho protos kai ho 
eschatos). Repeating the language of 1:17. Which was dead 
(hos egeneto nekros). Rather, “who became dead” (second 
aorist middle indicative of ginomai) as in 1:18. And lived 
again (kai ezesen). First aorist (ingressive, came to life) 
active of 2a6 (ho zon in 1:18). Emphasis on the resurrection 
of Christ. 

9. Thy tribulation and thy poverty (sou tén thlipsin kai 
ptocheian). Separate articles of same gender, emphasizing 
eachitem. The tribulation was probably persecution, which 
helped to intensify the poverty of the Christians (James 
2:5; I Cor. 1:26; II Cor. 6:10; 8:2). In contrast with the 
wealthy church in Laodicea (3:17). But thou art rich (alla 
plousios ei). Parenthesis to show the spiritual riches of 
this church in contrast with the spiritual poverty in Lao- 


302 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


dicea (3:17), this a rich poor church, that a poor rich church. 
Rich in grace toward God (Luke 12:21) and in good deeds 
(I Tim. 6:18). Perhaps Jews and pagans had pillaged their 
property (Heb. 10:34), poor as they already were. Blas- 
phemy (blasphémian). Reviling believers in Christ. See 
Mark 7:22. The precise charge by these Jews is not in- 
dicated, but see Acts 13:45. Of them which say (ek ton 
legonton). “From those saying” (ek with the ablative plural 
of the present active articular participle of /ego). They are 
Fews (Ioudaious einai heautous). ‘This is the accusative of 
general reference and the infinitive in indirect discourse after 
lego (Acts 5:36; 8:9) even though /egonton is here ablative 
(cf. 3:9), common idiom. These are actual Jews and only 
Jews, not Christians. dud they are not (kai ouk etsin). 
Another parenthesis like that in 2:2. These are Jews in 
name only, not spiritual Jews (Gal. 6:15f., Rom. 2:28). 4 
synagogue of Satan (sunagogé tou Satana). In 3:9 again and 
note 2:13, 24, serving the devil (John 8:44) instead of the 
Lord (Numb. 16:3; 20:4). 

10. Fear not (mé phobou). Asin 1:17. Worse things are 
about to come than poverty and blasphemy, perhaps prison 
and death, for the devil “is about to cast” (mellei ballein), 
“is going to cast.”’ Some of you (ex humon). Without tinas 
(some) before ex humon, a common idiom as in 3:9; 11:19; 
Luke 11:49. That ye may be tried (hina peirasthéte). Pur- 
pose clause with hina and the first aorist passive subjunctive : 
of peirazd. John himself is in exile. Peter and John had 
often been in prison together. James the brother of John, 
Paul, and Peter had all suffered martyrdom. In 3:10 a 
general persecution is outlined by peirasmos.. Ye shall have 
(hexete). Future active, but some MSS. read echéte (present 
active subjunctive with Aina, “that ye may have”). Tribu- 
lation ten days (thlipsin hémeron deka). ‘Tribulation of ten 
days” (or “within ten days’’). It is unwise to seek a literal 
meaning for ten days. Even ten days of suffering might 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 303 


seem an eternity while they lasted. Be thou faithful (ginou 
pistos). “Keep on becoming faithful” (present middle im- 
perative of ginomai), “keep on proving faithful unto death” 
(Heb. 12:4) as the martyrs have done (Jesus most of all). 
The crown of life (ton stephanon tes zxoés). See this very 
image in James 1:12, a familiar metaphor in the games at 
Smyrna and elsewhere in which the prize was a garland. 
See also 3:11. The crown consists in life (2:7). See Paul’s 
use of stephanos in I Cor. 9:25; II Tim. 4:8. 

11. Shall not be hurt (ou mé adikéthéi). Strong double 
negative with first aorist passive subjunctive of adiked, old 
verb, to act unjustly (from adikos), here to do harm or wrong ~ 
to one, old usage as in 6:6; 7:2f.; 9:4, 10; 11:5. Of the second 
death (ek tou thanatou tou deuterou). Ek here used for the 
agent or instrument as often (3:18; 9:2; 18:1). See 20:6, 14; 
21:8 where “the second death” is explained as “the lake of 
fire.” The idea is present in Dan. 12:3 and John 5:29 and is 
current in Jewish circles as in the Jerusalem Targum on 
Deut. 33:6 and in Philo. Itis not annihilation. The Chris. 
tians put to death in the persecution will at least escape this 
second death (eternal punishment). 

12. In Pergamum (en Pergamdi). Ina north-easterly di- 
rection from Smyrna in the Caicus Valley, some fifty-five 
miles away, in Mysia, on a lofty hill, a great political and 
religious centre. Ramsay (op. cit., p. 281) calls it “the royal 
city, the city of authority.” Eumenes II (8.c. 197-159) 
extended it and embellished it with many great buildings, 
including a library with 200,000 volumes, second only to 
Alexandria. The Kingdom of Pergamum became a Roman 
province B.c. 130. Pliny termed it the most illustrious city 
of Asia. Parchment (charta Pergamena) derived its name 
from Pergamum. It was a rival of Ephesus in the temples 
to Zeus, Athena, Dionysos, in the great grove Nicephorium 
(the glory of the city). Next to this was the grove and 
temple of Asklepios, the god of healing, called the god of 


304 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Pergamum, with a university for medical study. Pergamum 
was the first city in Asia (A.D. 29) with a temple for the 
worship of Augustus (Octavius Cesar). Hence in the 
Apocalypse Pergamum is a very centre of emperor-worship 
“where Satan dwells” (2:13). Here also the Nicolaitans 
flourished (2:15) as in Ephesus (2:6) and in Thyatira (2:20f.). 
Like Ephesus this city is called temple-sweeper (medkoros) for 
the gods. The sharp two-edged sword (ten romphaian tén 
distomon tén oxeian). This item repeated from 1:16 in the 
same order of words with the article three times (the sword 
the two-mouthed the sharp) singling out each point. 

13. Where (pou—hopou). Pou is interrogative adverb 
used here in an indirect question as in John 1:39. Hopou is 
relative adverb referring to pou. Satan’s throne (ho thronos 
tou Satana). Satan not simply resided in Pergamum, but his 
“throne” or seat of power of king or judge (Matt. 19:28; 
Luke 1:32, 52). The symbol of Asklepios was the serpent 
as it is of Satan (12:9; 20:2). There was, besides, a great 
throne altar to Zeus cut on the Acropolis rock, symbol of 
“rampant paganism” (Swete) and the new Czsar-worship 
with the recent martyrdom of Antipas made Pergamum 
indeed a very throne of Satan. Holdest fast my name 
(krateis to onoma sou). Present active indicative of krated, 
“dost keep on holding,” as in 2:25, 3:11. This church re- 
fused to say Kurios Kaisar (Martyrd. Polyc. 8f.) and con- 
tinued to say Kurios Iésous (I Cor. 12:3). They stood true - 
against the emperor-worship. Didst not deny (ouk érnéso). 
First aorist middle second person singular of arneomai. 
Reference to a specific incident not known to us. My faith 
(tén pistin mou). Objective genitive, “thy faith in me.” 
Of Antipas (Antipas). Indeclinable in this form. It is pos- 
sible that Antipa (genitive) was really written, though unim- 
portant as the nominative follows in apposition. Nothing is 
really known of this early martyr in Pergamum before the 
writing of the Apocalypse. One legend is that he was burnt 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 305 


to death in a brazen bull. Other martyrs followed him at 
Pergamum (Agathonice, Attalus, Carpus, Polybus). My 
witness (ho martus mou). Nominative in apposition with a 
genitive as in 1:5 (with ablative), common solecism in the 
Apocalypse. “Witness” as Jesus had said they should be 
(Acts 1:8) and Stephen was (Acts 22:20) and others were 
(Rev. 17:6). The word later (by third century) took on the 
modern meaning of martyr. My faithful one (ho pistos mou). 
Nominative also, with mou also. Jesus gives Antipas his 
own title (Swete) asin 1:5;3:14. Faithfuluntodeath. Was 
killed (apektanthe). First aorist passive indicative of apok- 
teind, this passive form common in the Apocalypse (2:13; 
6:11; 5:9, 13; 13:10, 15; 18, 20; 19:21). Among you (par’ 
humin). By your side. Proof of the throne of Satan, 
“where Satan dwells” (hopou ho Satandas katoikei), repeated 
for emphasis. 

14. There (ekei). That is par’ humin (among you). A 
party in the church that resisted emperor-worship, to the 
death in the case of Antipas, yet were caught in the insidious 
wiles of the Nicolaitans which the church in Ephesus with- 
stood. Some that hold (kratountas). ‘‘Men holding” (pres- 
ent active participle of krated). The teaching of Balaam (ten 
didachén Balaam). Indeclinable substantive Balaam (Numb. 
25:1-g; 31:15f.). The point of likeness of these heretics 
with Balaam is here explained. Taught Balak (edidasken 
toi Balak). Imperfect indicative of didask6é, Balaam’s habit, 
“as the prototype of all corrupt teachers” (Charles). These 
early Gnostics practised licentiousness as a principle since 
they were not under law, but under grace (Rom. 6:15). The 
use of the dative with didasko is a colloquialism rather than 
a Hebraism. Two accusatives often occur with didaské. 
To cast a stumbling-block (balein skandalon). Second aorist 
active infinitive (accusative case after edidasken) of ballé, 
regular use with skandalon (trap) like tithémi skandalon in 
Rom. 14:13. Balaam, as Josephus and Philo also say, 


306 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


showed Balak how to set a trap for the Israelites by beguiling 
them into the double sin of idolatry and fornication, which 
often went together (and do so still). To eat things sacrificed 
to idols (phagein eidolothuta). Second aorist active infinitive 
of esthid and the verbal adjective (from eidélon and thud), 
quoted here from Numb. 25:1f., but in inverse order, re- 
peated in other order in verse 20. See Acts 15:29; 21:25; 
I Cor. 8:1ff. for the controversy over the temptation to 
Gentile Christians to do what in itself was harmless, but 
which led to evil if it led to participation in the pagan feasts. 
Perhaps both ideas are involved here. Balaam taught 
Balak how to lead the Israelites into sin in both ways. 

15. So thou also (houtos kai su). Thou and the church at 
Pergamum as Israel had the wiles of Balaam. The teaching 
of the Nicolaitans likewise (tén didachén ton WNikolaiton 
homoids). See on 1:6 for the Nicolaitans. The use of 
homoids (likewise) here shows that they followed Balaam in 
not obeying the decision of the Conference at Jerusalem 
(Acts 15:20, 29) about idolatry and fornication, with the 
result that they encouraged a return to pagan laxity of 
morals (Swete). Some wrongly hold that these Nicolaitans 
were Pauline Christians in the face of Col. 3:5-8; Eph. 5:3-6. 

16. Repent therefore (metanoéson oun). First aorist (tense 
of urgency) active imperative of metanoed with the inferential 
particle oun (as a result of their sin). J come (erchomai). 
Futuristic present middle indicative, “I am coming” (immi- 
nent), as in 2:5 with tachu as in 3:11; 11:14; 22:7,12,20. As 
with en tachei (1:1), we do not know how soon “quickly”’ is 
meant to be understood. But it is a real threat. Against 
them (met? auton). This proposition with polemed rather 
than kata (against) is common in the LXX, but in the N.T. 
only in Rev. 2:16; 12:7; 13:4; 17:14 and the verb itself 
nowhere else in N.T. except James 4:2. ‘“‘An eternal roll of 
thunder from the throne” (Renan). “The glorified Christ 
is in this book a Warrior, who fights with the sharp sword of 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 307 


the word” (Swete). With (en). Instrumental use of en. 
For the language see 1:16; 2:12; 19:15. 

17. Of the hidden manna (tou manna tou kekrummenou). 
“Of the manna the hidden” (perfect passive articular par- 
ticiple of krupto). The partitive genitive, the only N.T. 
example with diddmi, though Q reads fo (accusative) here. 
For examples of the ablative with apo and ek see Robertson, 
Grammar, p. 519. See John 6:31, 49 for the indeclinable 
word manna. ‘The golden pot of manna was “laid up before 
God in the ark” (Ex. 16:23). It was believed that Jeremiah 
hid the ark, before the destruction of Jerusalem, where it 
would not be discovered till Israel was restored (II Macc. 
2:5ff.). Christ is the true bread from heaven (John 6:31-33, 
48-51) and that may be the idea here. Those faithful to 
Christ will have transcendent fellowship with him. Swete 
takes it to be “the life-sustaining power of the Sacred 
Humanity now hid with Christ in God.” 4 white stone 
(pséphon leuken). This old word for pebble (from psad, to 
rub) was used in courts of justice, black pebbles for con- 
demning, white pebbles for acquitting. The only other use 
of the word in the N.T. is in Acts 26:10, where Paul speaks 
of “depositing his pebble” (katénegka pséphon) or casting his 
vote. The white stone with one’s name on it was used to 
admit one to entertainments and also as an amulet or charm. 
A new name written (onoma kainon gegrammenon). Perfect 
passive predicate participle of graphd. Not the man’s own 
name, but that of Christ (Heitmiller, Im Namen Feésu, 
p- 128-265). See 3:12 for the name of God so written on 
one. The man himself may be the pséphos on which 
the new name is written. “The true Christian has a 
charmed life” (Moffatt). But he that receiveth it (ei mé ho 
lambanon). “‘Except the one receiving it.” See Matt. 
11:27 for like intimate and secret knowledge between the 
Father and the Son and the one to whom the Son wills to 
reveal the Father. See also Rev. 19:12. 


308 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


18. In Thyatira (en Thuateirois). Some forty miles south- 
east of Pergamum, a Lydian city on the edge of Mysia, under 
Rome since B.c. 190, a centre of trade, especially for the royal 
purple, home of Lydia of Philippi (Acts 16:14f.), shown by 
inscriptions to be full of trade guilds, Apollo the chief deity 
with no emperor-worship, centre of activity by the Nico- 
laitans with their idolatry and licentiousness under a 
‘“prophetess” who defied the church there. Ramsay calls 
it ““Weakness Made Strong” (op. cit., p. 316). The Son of 
God (ho huios tou theou). Here Jesus is represented as calling 
himself by this title as in John 11:4 and as he affirms on 
path in Matt. 26:63f. ‘The Word of God” occurs in 19:13. 
His eyes like a flame of fire (tous ophthalmous autou hos 
phloga puros). Asin 1:14. His feet like burnished brass (hoi 
podes autou homoioi chalkolibandi). As in 1:15. 

19. Thy works (sou ta erga). As in 2:2 and explained 
(explanatory use of kai=namely) by what follows. Four 
items are given, with separate feminine article for each (téz 
agapen, tén pistin, tén diakonian, ten hupomonen), a longer list 
of graces than in 2:2 for Ephesus. More praise is given in 
the case of Ephesus and Thyatira when blame follows than 
in the case of Smyrna and Philadelphia when no fault is 
found. Love comes first in this list in true Johannine 
fashion. Faith (pistin) here may be “faithfulness,” and 
ministry (diakonian) is ministration to needs of others (Acts 
11:29; 1 Cor. 16:15). And that (kai). Only kai (and) in the - 
Greek, but doubtless oti (that) is understood. Than the 
first (ton proton). Ablative after the comparative pleiona 
(more). 

20. Thou sufferest (apheis). Late vernacular present active 
indicative second person singular as if from a form aphed 
instead of the usual aphiémi forms. The woman Fezebel 
(ten gunaika Iezabel). Symbolical name for some prominent 
woman in the church in Thyatira, like the infamous wife of 
Ahab who was guilty of whoredom and witchcraft (I Kings 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 309 


16:31; II Kings 9:22) and who sought to drive out the 
worship of God from Israel. Some MSS. here (A Q 40 min.s) 
have sou (thy wife, thy woman Ramsay makes it), but surely 
Aleph C P rightly reject sow. Otherwise she is the pastor’s 
wife! Which calleth. herself a prophetess (hé legousa heautén 
prophétin). Nominative articular participle of /egd in appo- 
sition with the accusative gunaika like ho martus in apposition 
with Antipas in 2:13. Prophétis is an old word, feminine 
form for prophétés, in N.T. only here and Luke 2:36 (Anna), 
two extremes surely. See Acts 21:9 for the daughters of 
Philip who prophesied. And she teacheth and seduceth (kai 
didaskei kai planai). A resolution of the participles (didas- 
kousa kai plandsa) into finite verbs (present active indica- 
tives) asin 1:5f. This woman was not a real prophetess, but 
a false one with loud claims and loose living. One is puzzled 
to know how such a woman had so much shrewdness and 
sex-appeal as to lead astray the servants of God in that 
church. The church tolerated the Nicolaitans and this 
leader whose primary object was sexual immorality (Charles) 
and became too much involved with her to handle the heresy. 

21. I gave her time (edoka autéi chronon). First aorist 
active indicative of diddmi, allusion to a definite visit or 
message of warning to this woman. That she should repent 
(hina metanoéséi). Sub-final use of hina with first aorist 
active subjunctive of metanoed. And she willeth not (kai ou 
thelei). “And she is not willing.” Blunt and final like Matt. 
23:37. To repent of (metanoésai ek). First aorist (ingressive) 
active infinitive with ek, “to make a change out of,” the 
usual construction with metanoed in this book (2:22; 9:20ff.; 
16:11), with apo in Acts 8:22. Porneia (fornication) here, 
but moicheud (to commit adultery) in verse 22. 

22. I do cast (ballo). Futuristic present active indicative 
rather than the future Ja/d, since judgment is imminent. 
Into a bed (eis klinén). “A bed of sickness in contrast with 
the bed of adultery” (Beckwith). Them that commit adultery 


310 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


with her (tous moicheuontas met autés). Present active ar- 
ticular participle accusative plural of moicheud. The actual 
paramours of the woman Jezebel, guilty of both porneia 
(fornication, verse 21) and moicheia (adultery), works of 
Jezebel of old and of this Jezebel. There may be also an 
allusion to the spiritual adultery (II Cor. 11:2) towards God 
and Christ as of old (Jer. 3:8; 5:7; Ezek. 16:22). Except they 
repent (ean mé metanoésousin). Condition of first class with 
ean mé and the future active indicative of metanoed, put in 
this vivid form rather than the aorist subjunctive (-dsin) 
third-class condition. Of her works (ek ton ergin autés). 
Autes (her) correct rather than autén (their). Jezebel was 
chiefly responsible. 

23. I will kill with death (apokteno en thanatoi). Future 
(volitive) active of apokteind with the tautological (cognate) 
en thanatoi (in the sense of pestilence) as in Ezek. 33:27. 
Her children (ta tekna autés). Either her actual children, 
like the fate of Ahab’s sons (II Kings 10:7) or “‘her spiritual 
progeny’’ (Swete) who have completely accepted her Nico- 
laitan practices. Shall know (gndsontai). Future (ingressive 
punctiliar) middle of gindskd, “shall come to know.” “The 
doom of the offenders was to be known as widely as the 
scandal had been” (Charles). Searcheth (eraundn). Present 
active articular participle of eraunad, to follow up, to track 
out, late form for eréunad, from Jer. 17:10. Reins (nephrous). 
Old word for kidneys, here only in N.T., quoted also with — 
kardias from Jer. 17:10. ‘See 22:17 for the reward of pun- 
ishment. 

24. To you the rest (humin tois loipois). Dative case. 
Those who hold out against Jezebel, not necessarily a minor- 
ity (9:20; 19:21; I Thess. 4:13). 4s many as (hosoi). In- 
clusive of all “the rest.” This teaching (tén didachén tauten). 
That of Jezebel. Which (hoitines). “Which very ones,” 
generic of the class, explanatory definition as in 1:7. Know 
not (ouk egnosan). Second aorist (ingressive) active of 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 311 


ginosko, “did not come to know by experience.” The deep 
things of Satan (ta bathea tou Satana). The Ophites. (wor- 
shippers of the serpent) and-other later Gnostics (Cainites, 
Carpocratians, Naassenes) boasted of their knowledge of 
“the deep things,” some claiming this very language about 
Satan (the serpent) as Paul did of God (I Cor. 2:10). It is 
not clear whether the words here quoted are a boast of the 
Nicolaitans or a reproach on the other Christians for not 
knowing the depths of sin. Some even claimed that they 
could indulge in immorality without sinning (I John 1:10; 
3:10). Perhaps both ideas are involved. As they say (his 
legousin). Probably referring to the heretics who ridicule - 
the piety of the other Christians. None other burden (ou— 
allo baros). Baros refers to weight (Matt. 20:12), phortion, 
from pherd, to bear, refers to load (Gal. 6:5), ogkos to bulk 
(Heb. 12:1). Apparently a reference to the decision of the 
Jerusalem Conference (Acts 15:28) where the very word 
baros is used and mention is made about the two items in 
verse 20 (fornication and idolatry) without mentioning the 
others about things strangled, etc. See the Pharisaic narrow- 
ness in Matt. 23:4. 

25. Howbeit (plen). Common after ouk allo as a preposi- 
tion with the ablative (Mark 12:32), but here a conjunction 
as in Phil. 1:18. Hold fast (kratésate). First aorist active 
imperative of krated, either ingressive (get a grip on) or con- 
stative (hold on as a single decisive effort). See present 
imperative kratei in 3:11 (keep on holding). Til] I come 
(achri hou an héxd). Indefinite temporal clause with achri 
hou (until which time) with modal av and either the future 
active indicative or the first aorist active subjunctive of héké 
(usual idiom with achri in Revelation as in 7:3; 15:8; 20:3, 5). 

26. He that overcometh and he that keepeth (ho nikon kai ho 
téron). Present active articular participles of nikaé and ¢éred 
in the nominative absolute (xominativus pendens) as in 3:12, 
21, resumed by the dative autoi (to him), as in verses 7, 17. 


312 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Unto the end (achri telous). That is, achri hou an héxo above. 
Authority over the nations (exousian epi ton ethnon). From 
Ps. 2:8f. The followers of the Messiah will share in his 
victory over his enemies (1:6; 12:5; 19:15). 

27. He shall rule (poimanei). Future active of poimaind, 
to shepherd (from poimén, shepherd), also from Ps. 2:8f. 
See again Rev. 7:17; 12:5; 19:15. With a rod of iron (en 
rabdoi siderai). Continuing the quotation. Instrumental 
use of en. Rabdos (feminine) is the royal sceptre and indi- 
cates rigorous rule. The vessels of the potter (ta skeué ta 
keramika). Old adjective, belonging to a potter (kerameus, 
keramos), here only in N.T. Are broken to shivers (suntri- 
betai). Present passive indicative of suntribé, old verb, to 
rub together, to break in pieces (Mark 14:3). 

28. 4s I also have received (hos kago eilépha). Perfect ac- 
tive indicative of /amband. Christ still possesses the power 
from the Father (Acts 2:33; Ps. 2:7). The morning star 
(ton astera ton proinon). “The star the morning one.” In 
22:16 Christ is the bright morning star. The victor will 
nave Christ himself. 


CHAPTERVWIILI 


1. In Sardis (en Sardesin). Some thirty miles south-east 
of Thyatira, old capital of Lydia, wealthy and the home of 
Croesus, conquered by Cyrus and then by Alexander the 
Great, in B.c. 214 by Antiochus the Great, at the crossing 
of Roman roads, in a plain watered by the river Pactolus, 
according to Pliny the place where the dyeing of wool was 
discovered, seat of the licentious worship of Cybele and the- 
ruins of the temple still there, called by Ramsay (op. cit., 
P- 354) “the city of Death,” city of softness and luxury, 
of apathy and immorality, “a contrast of past splendour 
and present unresting decline” (Charles). Along with Lao- 
dicea it was blamed most of all the seven churches. That 
hath the seven Spirits of God (ho echin ta hepta pneumata tou 
theou). For which picture of the Holy Spirit see 1:4. And 
the seven stars (kai tous hepta asteras). As in 1:16, 20. 4 
name that thou livest (onoma hoti zéis). A name in contrast 
with reality. The oti clause in apposition with onoma. 
And thou art dead (kai nekros ei). “The paradox of death 
under the name of life’ (Swete). Not complete (a nucleus 
of life) death (verse 2), but rapidly dying. See the picture 
in James 2:17; II Cor. 6:9; II Tim. 3:5. 

2. Be thou watchful (ginou grégoron). Periphrastic im- 
perative with present middle of ginomai (keep on becoming) 
and present active participle of grégored (late present from 
perfect egrégora and that from egeird, as in Matt. 24:42) 
and see 16:15 for grégored also. He does not say “‘Arise 
from the dead” (Eph. 5:14), for there are vestiges of life. 
Those still alive are addressed through the angel of the 
church. Stablish the things that remain (sterison ta loipa). 
First aorist active imperative of stérizd, to make stable. 

313 


314 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Those not actually dead, but in grave peril. See a like 
command to Titus in Crete (1:5). Every new pastor faces 
such a problem. Which were ready to die (ha emellon apoth- 
anein). Imperfect active plural because the individuals, 
though neuter plural, are regarded as living realities. The 
imperfect looking on the situation “with a delicate opti- 
mism” (Swete) as having passed the crisis, a sort of epistolary 
imperfect. For I have found no works of thine (ou gar heureka 
sou erga). “‘For I have not found any works of thine.” 
Perfect active indicative of heuriskd. The church as a whole 
represented by sou (thy). Fulfilled (pepléromena). Perfect 
passive predicate participle of pl/érod. Their works have not 
measured up to God’s standard (endpion tou theou mou). 

3- Remember (mnémoneue). ‘‘Keep in mind,” as in 2:5. 
Therefore (oun). Resumptive and coérdinating as in 1:19; 
2:5. Thou hast received (eiléphas). Perfect active indicative 
of lamband, “as a permanent deposit” (Vincent). Didst 
hear (ékousas). First aorist active indicative, the act of 
hearing at the time. And keep it (kai térei). Present active 
imperative of téred, “hold on to what thou hast.” And re- 
pent (kai metanoéson). First aorist active imperative of 
metanoed, “Turn at once.” If therefore thou shalt not watch 
(can oun mé grégoréséis). Condition of third class with ean 
mé and the first aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive of 
grégored, ‘“if then thou do not wake up.” J will come (héxd). 
Certainly future active here, though probably aorist sub- - 
junctive in 2:25. 4s a thief (hos kleptes). As Jesus had 
already said (Matt. 24:43; Luke 12:39), as Paul had said 
(I Thess. 5:2), as Peter had said (II Pet. 3:10), as Jesus 
will say again (Rev. 16:15). Thou shalt not know (ou mé 
gndis). Strong double negative ow mé with second aorist 
active subjunctive of gindskd, though some MSS. have the 
future middle indicative gndséi. What hour (poian horan). 
A rare classical idiom (accusative) surviving in the Koiné 
rather than the genitive of time, somewhat like John 4:52; 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 315 


Acts 20:16 (Robertson, Grammar, p. 470f.). Indirect ques- 
tion with poian. 

4. 4 few names (oliga onomata). This use of onoma for 
persons is seen in the Koiné (Deissmann, Bidle Studies, p. 
196f.) as in Acts 1:15; Rev. 11:13. Did not defile (ouk 
emolunan). First aorist active indicative of moluno (I Cor. 
8:7; I Pet. 1:4), pollution. They shall walk (peripatésousin). 
Future active of peripated, promise of fellowship with Christ 
(met emou, with me) “in white” (en Jeukois), as symbols of 
purity (7:9, 13) like the angel (Matt. 28:3), with possibly 
a reference to Enoch (Gen. 5:22). For they are worthy (hoti 
axioi eisin). ‘To walk with Christ, not worthy in the same 
sense as God and Christ (4:11; 5:9), but in a relative sense. 
See Rev. 16:6 for bad sense of axios. 

§. Shall be arrayed (peribaleitai). Future middle indica- 
tive of periballo, to fling around one, here and in 4:4 with 
en and the locative, but usually in this book with the ac- 
cusative of the thing, retained in the passive or with the 
rete leh opens rer pas Hest Fh 724 08167) 193873)? 
In white garments (en himatiois leukois). Apparently the 
spiritual bodies in the risen life as in II Cor. §:1, 4 and often 
in Revelation (3:4, 5; 6:11; 7:9, 13f.; 19:8). J will in no 
wise blot out (ou mé exaleipso). Strong double negative ou 
mé and the first aorist active (or future) of exaleipho, old 
word, to wipe out (Acts 3:19). Of the book of life (ek tés 
biblou tés zoés). Ablative case with ek. This divine register 
first occurs in Ex. 32:32f. and often in the O.T. See Luke 
10:20; Phil. 4:3; Rev. 13:8; 20:15; 21:27. The book is in 
Christ’s hands (13:8; 21:27). His name (to onoma autou). 
The name of the one who overcomes (fo nikon). Clear 
reminiscence of the words of Christ about confessing to the 
Father those who confess him here (Matt. 10:32; Mark 
$:38; Luke 9:26; 12:8). Whether John knew the Synoptic 
Gospels (and why not?) he certainly knew such sayings of 
Tesus.

7. In Philadelphia (en Philadelphiai). Some twenty-eight 
miles south-east of Sardis, in Lydia, subject to earthquakes, 
rebuilt by Tiberius after the great earthquake of a.D. 17, 
for a time called in coins Neo-Cesarea, in wine-growing 
district with Bacchus (Dionysos) as the chief deity, on fine 
Roman roads and of commercial importance, though not a 
large city, called by Ramsay (op. cit., p. 392) ‘“‘the Mission- 
ary City” to promote the spread of the Graeco-Roman 
civilization and then of Christianity, later offering stubborn 
resistance to the Turks (1379-90 a.D.) and now called Ala- 
Sheher (reddish city, Charles, from the red hills behind it). 
The chief opposition to the faithful little church is from the 
Jews (cf. Rom. 9-11). There are some 1,000 Christians 
there today. The holy, he that is true (ho hagios, ho alethinos). 
Separate articles (four in all) for each item in this descrip- 
tion. ‘“‘The holy, the genuine.’’ Asyndeton in the Greek. 
Latin Vulgate, Sanctus et Verus. Ho hagios is ascribed to 
God in 4:8; 6:10 (both hagios and aléthinos as here), but 
to Christ in Mark 1:24; Luke 4:34; John 6:69; Acts 4:27, 
30; I John 2:20, a recognized title of the Messiah as the 
consecrated one set apart. Swete notes that aléthinos is 
verus as distinguished from verax (aléthés). So it is applied 
to God in 6:10 and to Christ in 3:14; 19:11 as in John 1:9; 
6:32; 15:1. He that hath the key of David (ho echon tén klein 
Daueid). This epithet comes from Is. 22:22, where Eliakim 
as the chief steward of the royal household holds the keys 
of power. Christ as the Messiah (Rev. 5:5; 22:16) has ex- 
clusive power in heaven, on earth, and in Hades (Matt. 
16:19; 28:18; Rom. 14:9; Phil. 2:9f.; Rev. 1:18). Christ 
has power to admit and exclude of his own will (Matt. 
25:10f.; Eph. 1:22; Rev. 3:21; 19:11-16; 20:4; 22:16). And 
none shall shut (kai oudeis kleisei). Charles calls the struc- 
ture Hebrew (future active indicative of kleid), and not 
Greek because it does not correspond to the present artic- 
ular participle just before ho anoigdn (the one opening), but 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 317 


it occurs often in this book as in the very next clause, “and 
none openeth” (kai oudeis anoigei) over against kleidn 
(present active participle, opening) though here some MSS. 
read kieiei (present active indicative, open). 

8. I have set (dedoka). Perfect active indicative of didomi, 
“TI have given” (a gift of Christ, this open door). See Luke 
12:51 for a like use of diddmi. A door .opened (thuran 
Enedigmenén). Perfect (triple reduplication) passive pred- 
icate participle of anoigé (verse 7) accusative feminine singu- 
lar. The metaphor of the open door was a common one 
(John 10:7-9; Acts 14:27; I Cor. 16:9; II Cor. 2:12; Col. 
4:3; Rev. 3:20; 4:1). Probably it means here a good oppor. 
tunity for missionary effort in spite of the Jewish hostility. 
Which (hén—autén). Pleonastic vernacular and Hebrew 
repetition of the personal pronoun au/én (it) after the rela- 
tive hén (which). Direct reference to the statement in verse 
7. That (hoti). This conjunction resumes the construction 
of oida sou ta erga (1 know thy works) after the parenthesis 
(tdou—autén, Behold—shut). 4 little power (mikran duna, 
min). Probably “little power,” little influence or weight 
in Philadelphia, the members probably from the lower classes 
(I Cor. 1:26f.). And didst keep (kai etérésas). “And yet 
(adversative use of kai) didst keep” (first aorist active in- 
dicative of téred) my word in some crisis of trial. See John 
17:6 for the phrase “‘keeping the word.” Didst not deny 
(ouk érnésé). First aorist middle indicative second person 
singular of arneomai. ‘The issue was probably forced by 
the Jews (cf. 2:9), but they stood true. 

g. I give (dido). Late omega form for didémi, but the 
-mi form in 17:13 (didoasin). These Jewish converts are a 
gift from Christ. For this use of diddmi see Acts 2:27; 
10:40; 14:3. There is ellipse of sivas before ek as in 2:10 
(ex humon) and see 2:9 for ‘‘the synagogue of Satan.” Of 
them which say (ton legonton). Ablative plural in apposition 
with sunagogés. On the construction of heautous Ioudaious 


318 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


einai see on 2:9 (Loudaious einai heautous, the order of 
words being immaterial). But do lie (alla pseudontai). Pres- 
ent middle indicative of pseudomai, explanatory positive, 
addition here to kai ouk eisin of 2:9, in contrast also with 
ho aléthinos of verse 7 and in Johannine style (John 8:44; 
I John 1:10; 2:4). J will make them (poiéso autous). Future 
active indicative of poied, resuming the prophecy after the 
parenthesis (tén—pseudontai, which say—but do lie). To 
come and worship (hina hexousin kai proskunésousin). “That 
they come and worship” (final clause, like facio ut in Latin, 
with hina and the future active of hé@kd and proskuned). 
The language is based on Is. 45:14; 60:14. The Jews ex- 
pected homage (not worship in the strict sense) from the 
Gentiles, but it will come to the Christians at last (I Cor. 
14:24). Later Ignatius (Philad. 6) warns this church against 
Judaizing Christians, perhaps one result of an influx of Jews. 
And to know (kai gnésin). Continuation of the purpose 
clause with Aina, but with the second aorist active subjunc- 
tive rather than the less usual future indicative. See both 
constructions also with Aina in 22:14. Probably a reminis- 
cence of Is. 43:4 in egd égapésa se (I loved thee), first aorist 
active indicative. 

10. Patience (hupomenés). “Endurance” as in 13:10; 
14:12 as also in II Thess. 3:5. Thou didst keep (etérésas)—I 
also will keep (kago teréso). Aorist active indicative and 
future active corresponding to each other. For a like play " 
on the tenses of this verb by Christ see John 17:6 (tetérékan), 
II (¢éréson), 12 (eteroun). From the hour of trial (ek tés horas 
tou peirasmou). ‘This use of ek after téred in John 17:15, apo 
in James 1:27. Trial brings temptation often (James 1:2, 
13). Jesus endured (Heb. 12:1f.) and he will help them. 
There is still a church in Philadelphia in spite of the Turks. 
Which is to come (és mellousés erchesthai). Agreeing with 
horas (feminine), not with peirasmou (masculine). Upon the 
whole world (epi tes epoikoumenés holés). The inhabited 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 319 


earth (gés) as in Rev. 12:19; Luke 2:1; Acts 16:6, etc.), not 
the physical earth, but the world of men as explained by 
the next clause. To try (peirasai). First aorist active in- 
finitive of purpose from peirazd, probably to tempt (cf. the 
demons in g:I-21), not merely to afflict (2:10). That dwell 
upon the earth (tous katoikountas epi tés gés). Present active 
articular participle of katoiked, explaining “‘the whole world” 
just before. 

11. [ come quickly (erchomai tachu). As in 2:16; 22:7, 
12, 20. “The keynote of the book” (Beckwith). But 
allow the author’s own meaning of “quickly.” Hold fast 
that which thou hast (kratei ho echeis). Sort of motto for each 
church (2:25). That no one take (hina médeis labéi). Pur- 
pose clause with Aina and second aorist active subjunctive of 
lambano. Here to take away “thy crown” (2:10) which will 
be thine if really won and not forfeited by failure (II Tim. 
4:8). In that case it will go to another (Matt. 25:28; Rom. 
11:17f.). 

12. He that overcometh (ho nikin). Nominative absolute 
as in 2:26, resumed by the accusative auton (him). 4 pillar 
(stulon). Old word for column, in N.T. only here, 10:1; 
Gal. 2:9; I Tim. 3:15. Metaphorical and personal use with 
a double significance of being firmly fixed and giving stability 
to the building. Philadelphia was a city of earthquakes. 
“Temple” (zaos) here is also metaphorical (7:15), as in 
I Tim. 3:15 for the people of God. In 21:22 we read that 
there is no temple in the heavenly Jerusalem (21:10-22:5) 
descending as the new Jerusalem with God himself as the 
temple, though the metaphorical temple is mentioned in 7:15. 
He shall go out thence no more (exd ou mé elthéi). Strong 
double negative ou mé with the second aorist active subjunc- 
tive of erchomai. The subject is ho nikon (the one over- 
coming). “Fixity of character is at last achieved” (Charles). 
He, like the stulos (pillar), remains in place. Upon him 
(ep’ auton). Upon ho nikon (the victor), not upon the pillar 


320 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(stulos). He receives this triple name (of God, of the city of 
God, of Christ) on his forehead (14:1; 7:3; 17:5; 22:4) just 
as the high-priest wore the name of Jehovah upon his fore- 
head (Ex. 28:36, 38), the new name (2:17), without any 
magical or talismanic power, but as proof of ownership by 
God, as a citizen of the New Jerusalem, with the new symbol 
of the glorious personality of Christ (Rev. 19:12), in contrast 
with the mark of the beast on others (13:17; 14:17). For 
citizenship in God’s city see Gal. 4:26; Phil. 3:20; Heb. 11:10; 
12:22; 13:14. The new Ferusalem (tes kainés Ierousalém). 
Not neas (young), but kainés (fresh). See also 21:2, 10 and 
already Gal. 4:26 and Heb. 12:22. Charles distinguishes 
between the Jerusalem before the final judgment and this 
new Jerusalem after thatevent. Perhapsso! In the Apoca- 
lypse always this form Jerousalém (3:12; 21:2, 10), but in 
John’s Gospel Hierosoluma (1:19, etc.). Which cometh down 
(hé katabainousa). Nominative case in apposition with the 
preceding genitive poleds as in 1:5; 2:20, etc. Mine own new 
name (to onoma mou to kainon). For which see 2:17; 19:12, 
16. Christ himself will receive a new name along with all 
else in the future world (Gressmann). 

14. In Laodicea (en Laodikiai). Forty miles south-east of 
Philadelphia and some forty miles east of Ephesus, the last 
of the seven churches addressed with special messages, on 
the river Lycus on the border of Phrygia, near Colossz and 
Hierapolis, recipient of two letters by Paul (Col. 4:16), on 
the great trade-route from Ephesus to the east and seat of 
large manufacturing and banking operations (especially of 
woollen carpets and clothing, Ramsay, Cities and Bishoprics 
of Phrygia, p. 4off.), centre of the worship of Asklepios and 
seat of a medical school and also of a provincial court where 
Cicero lived and wrote many of his letters, home of many 
Jews, called by Ramsay (op. cit., p. 413) “the City of Com- 
promise,” the church here founded apparently by Epaphras 
(Col. 1:7; 4:12f.), now a deserted ruin, one of six cities with 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 321 


this name (meaning justice of the people). No praise is 

bestowed on this church, but only blame for its lukewarm- 

ness. The Amen (ho Amén). Personal (masculine article) 

name here alone, though in Is. 65:16 we have “the God of 

Amen” understood in the LXX as “‘the God of truth”’ (ton 

theon ton aléthinon). Here applied to Christ. See 1:5 for 

ho martus ho pistos (the faithful witness) and 3:7 for ho a/e- 

thinos (the genuine), ‘““whose testimony never falls short of 
the truth” (Swete). The beginning of the creation of God (hé 
arché tes ktiseds tou theou). Not the first of creatures as the 

Arians held and Unitarians do now, but the originating 
source of creation through whom God works (Col. 1:15, 18,. 
a passage probably known to the Laodiceans, John 1:3; Heb. 

¥-oJ-asis;madeclearsby, 1 2185 (228393 3215 15:313)s 

15. Neither cold (oute psuchros). Old word from psucho, 
to grow cold (Matt. 24:12), in N.T. only Matt. 10:42 and this 
passage. Nor hot (oute zestos). Late verbal from zed, to boil, 
(Rom. 12:11), boiling hot, here only in N.T. J would thou 
wert (ophelon és). Wish about the present with ophelon 
(really Gphelon, second aorist active indicative of ophezlo, 
without augment) with the imperfect és (instead of the in- 
finitive) as in II Cor. 11:1, when the old Greek used ezthe or et 
gar. SeeI Cor. 4:8 for the aorist indicative and Gal. 5:12 for 
the future. 

16. Lukewarm (chliaros). Tepid. Old adjective from chiia, 
to liquefy, to melt, here alone in N.T. J will (mello). “I 
am about to,” on the point of. Spew thee (se emesai). First 
aorist active infinitive of emed, old verb to vomit, to reject 
with extreme disgust, here alone in N.T. 

17. I am rich (hoti plousios eimi). Recitative hoti like 
quotation marks before direct quotation. Old adjective 
from ploutos, riches, wealth. Laodicea was a wealthy city 
and the church “carried the pride of wealth into its 
spiritual life” (Swete). Have gotten riches (peploutéka). Per- 
fect active indicative of plouted, old verb from ploutos, used 


322 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


here of imagined spiritual riches which the church did not 
possess, just the opposite of church in Smyrna (poor in 
wealth, rich in grace). This church was in a rich city and 
was rich in pride and conceit, but poor in grace and ignorant 
of its spiritual poverty (ouk oidas, knowest not). The 
wretched one (ho talaiporos). Old adjective from ¢lad, to 
endure, and péros, a callus, afflicted, in N.T. only here and 
Rom. 7:24. Note the one article in the predicate with all 
these five adjectives unifying the picture of sharp emphasis 
on “thou” (sz), “thou that boastest.” Miserable (eleeinos). 
Pitiable as in I Cor. 15:19. Poor (ptachos). See 2:9 for 
spiritual poverty. Perhaps some local example of self-com- 
placency is in mind. Blind (tuphios). Spiritual blindness 
as often (Matt. 23:17), and note “‘eye-salve” in verse 18. 
Naked (gumnos). “The figure completes the picture of 
actual poverty” (Beckwith). See 15 and 16. 

18. [ counsel (sumbouleud). Present active indicative, old 
compound from sumboulos, counsellor (Rom. 11:34), as in 
John 18:14. Almost ironical in tone. To buy (agorasai). 
First aorist active infinitive of agorazd (from agora, market- 
place), rich as they think themselves to be. From me (par’ 
emou). Krom my side, emphatic. Refined by fire (pepuré- 
menon ek puros). Perfect passive participle of purod (as in 
1:15) and the metaphor carried on by ek puros, “fired by 
fire.” Purity by removing dross (Ps. 66:10) like I Pet. ery. 
That thou mayest become rich (hina ploutéséis). Purpose - 
clause with hina and the ingressive first aorist active of 
plouteo, spiritual riches. That thou mayest clothe thyself 
(Aina peribaléi). Purpose clause with hina and second aorist 
middle (direct) subjunctive of periballa, to fling round one as 
in 3:5. Be not made manifest (mé phanerathéi). Continued 
purpose clause with negative mé and first aorist passive sub- 
junctive of phanerod. Nakedness (gumnotétos). Late and 
rare word from gumnos, naked, in N.T. only here, II Cor. 


11:27; Rom. 8:35. Cf. Rev. 16:15; 20:13; II Cor. 5:2f. Eye- 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 323 


salve (kollourion). Diminutive of kollura (coarse bread of 
cylindrical shape), object of agorasai, name for a famous 
Phrygian powder for the eyes made in Laodicea (Charles), 
Latin collyrium (used for eye-salve by Horace and Juvenal). 
To anoint (egchrisai).. First aorist active infinitive (epexe- 
getic) of egchrid, late compound (en, chrid, Strabo, Epictetus), 
to rub in, here only in N.T. That thou mayest see (hine 
blepeis). Another purpose clause with hina and the present 
active subjunctive (keep on seeing). 

19. Free rendering of Prov. 3:12 (in Heb. 12:6), but with 

hous ean (indefinite relative plural) for hon (definite relative 
singular), with pAilé instead of agapai and with the first - 
person paideud for paideuei (the Lord chastens, from pais, 
child, training a child) and with e/egché (reprove) added. Be 
zealous (zéleue). Present active imperative of zé/eud, in good 
sense (from zé/os, zed, to boil), in opposition to their luke- 
warmness, here only in N.T. (elsewhere 22/00), “keep on 
being zealous.” Repent (metanoéson). Ingressive first aorist 
active imperative of metanoed. 
_ 20. I stand at the door (hestéka epi tén thuran). Perfect 
active of histémi (intransitive). Picture of the Lord’s advent 
as in Matt. 24:33; James 5:9, but true also of the individual 
response to Christ’s call (Luke 12:36) as shown in Holman 
Hunt’s great picture. Some see a use also of Song of Solo- 
mon 5:2. If any man hear—and open (ean tis akouséi kai 
anoixei). Condition of third class with eam and first aorist 
(ingressive) active subjunctive of akoud and anoigd. See 
John 10:3; 18:37. See the picture reversed (Swete) in Luke 
13:25 and Matt. 25:10. J will come in to him (eiseleusomai). 
Future middle of ezserchomai. See Mark 15:43; Acts 11:3 
for eiserchomai pros, to go into a man’s house. Cf. John 
14:23. Will sup (deipnéso). Future active of deipned, old 
verb, from deipnon (supper), asin Luke 17:8. Fellowship in 
the Messianic kingdom (Luke 22:30; Mark 14:25; Matt. 
26:29). Purely metaphorical, as is plain from I Cor. 6:13. 


324 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


21. He that overcometh (ho nikon). Absolute nominative 
again as in 3:12, but resumed this time by the dative autoi 
as in 2:26. To sit (kathisai). First aorist active infinitive 
of kathizd. This promise grows out of the prophecy that the 
saints will share in the Messiah’s rule, made to the twelve 
(Matt. 19:28; Luke 22:20f.), repeated by Paul (I Cor. 6:2f.), 
enlarged in Rev. 22:1-5 (to last forever, II Tim. 2:11f.). 
James and John took this hope and promise literally (Mark 
10:40) not metaphorically. 4s I also overcame (hos kago 
enikésa). First aorist active indicative of nikad, looking 
back on the victory as over in the past. In John 16:33 
before the Cross Jesus says Egd nenikéka ton kosmon (perfect 
active), emphasizing the abiding effect of the victory. Sat 
down (ekathisa). “I took my seat” (Heb. 1:3) where Christ 
is now (Rev. 22:3; Col. 3:1). Cf. I John 5:4; Rev. 2:27f. 
Each of these seven messages begins alike and ends alike. 
Each is the message of the Christ and of the Holy Spirit 
to the angel of the church. Each has a special message 
suited to the actual condition of each church. In each case 
the individual who overcomes has a promise of blessing. 
Christ the Shepherd knows his sheep and lays bare the par- 


ticular peril in each case. 


CHAPTER IV 


1. After these things (meta tauta). Change in the pano- 
rama, not chronology (7:1, 9; 15:5; 18:1; 19:1). This vision 
is of heaven, not of earth as was true of chapters 1 and 2. 
The first vision of Christ and the messages to the seven 
churches began in 1:12f. This new vision of the throne in 
heaven (4:1-11) succeeds that to which it here alludes. J 
saw (eidon). Second aorist active indicative of horad. Be- 
hold (idou). Exclamation of vivid emotion as John looked. 
No effect on the structure and nominative case ¢hura (door) 
follows it. Opened (énedigmené). Perfect (triple reduplication) 
passive participle of avoigé as in 3:8 (door of opportunity) 
and 3:20 (door of the heart), here the door of revelation 
(Swete). In heaven (en toi ourandi). As in Ezek. 1:1; Mark 
1:10; John 1:51. In Revelation always in singular except 
12:12. The first (hé prote). Reference is to 1:10. Speaking 
(lalousés). From Jaleé, rather legousés of 1:10 from /egd, both 
agreeing with sa/piggos (trumpet). Saying (/egon). Present 
active participle of /egd repeating the idea of Jalousés, but 
in the nominative masculine singular construed with phoné 
(feminine singular), construction according to sense because 
of the person behind the voice as in 11:15; 19:14. Come up 
(anaba). Short Koiné form for anabdéthi (second aorist active 
imperative second person singular of anabaind). Hither 
(hode). Originally ‘“‘here,” but vernacular use (John 6:25; 
10:27). J will show (deixo). Future active of detknumi in 
same sense in 1:1. Hereafter (meta tauta). Some editors 
(Westcott and Hort) connect these words with the beginning 
of verse 2. 

2. Straightway I was in the Spirit (eutheds egenomén en 
pneumati). But John had already “come to be in the 

325 


326 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Spirit” (1:10, the very same phrase). Perhaps here effective 
aorist middle indicative while ingressive aorist in 1:10 (sequel 
or result, not entrance), ‘“‘At once I found myself in the 
Spirit”? (Swete), not “I came to be in the Spirit”’ as in 1:10. 
Was set (ekeito). Imperfect middle of keimai, old verb, used 
as passive of tithémi. As the vision opens John sees the 
throne already in place as the first thing in heaven. This 
bold imagery comes chiefly from I Kings 22:19; Is. 6:1ff.; 
Ezek. 1:26-28; Dan. 7:9f. One should not forget that this 
language is glorious imagery, not actual objects in heaven. 
God is spirit. The picture of God on the throne is common 
in the O.T. and the N.T. (Matt. 5:34f.; 23:22; Heb. 1:3 and 
in nearly every chapter in the Revelation, 1:4, etc.). The 
use of kathémenos (sitting) for the name of God is like the 
Hebrew avoidance of the name Yahweh and is distinguished 
from the Son in 6:16 and 7:10. Upon the throne (epi ton 
thronon). Epi with the accusative, as in 4:4; 6:2, 4f.; 11:16; 
20:4, but in verses g and 10, 4:1, 7, 13; 6:16; 7:15 we have 
epi tou thronou (genitive), while in 7:10; 19:14; 21:5 we have 
epi toi thronoi (locative) with no great distinction in the 
resultant idea. 

3. To look upon (horasei). WLocative case of horasis, old 
word (from horaé, to see) for appearance (in appearance) as 
in Ezek. 1:5, 26. Like a jasper stone (homoios iaspidi). As- 
sociative-instrumental case of iaspis, old word (Persian), 
used for stones of different colors, one opaque like opal, one 
translucent (21:11, 18f.; possibly here, only N.T. examples), 
one a red or yellow stone (Is. 54:12). Some even take it for 
the diamond. Certainly not our cheap modern jasper. 4 
sardius (sardioi). Old word, in N.T. only here and 21:20. 
The carnelian or other red stone, derived from Sardis (Pliny). 
Rainbow (iris). Old word, in N.T. only here and 10:1. 
From Ezek. 1:28. 4n emerald (smaragdindi). Adjective 
(from smaragdos, Rev. 21:19), of emerald (supply /ithdi), in 
associative instrumental case after homoios. John sees no 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 327 


form for God (Ex. 24:10), but only the brilliant flashing 
gems. “In the vision the flashing lustre of the iaspis and 
the fiery red of the sard are-relieved by the halo (iris) of 
emerald which encircled the Throne” (Swete). A complete 
circle. ; 
4. Round about the throne (kuklothen tou thronou). Here 
as a preposition with the genitive, though only adverb in 
4:8 (only N.T. examples save Textus Rec. in 5:11). Four 
and twenty thrones (thronoi etkosi tessares). So P Q, but 
Aleph A have accusative ¢hronous (supply eidon from 4:1) 
and ¢essares (late accusative in -es). This further circle of 
thrones beyond the great throne. J saw four and twenty 
elders (eikosi tessaras presbuterous). No eidon in the text, 
but the accusative case calls for it. Twenty-four as a 
symbolic number occurs only in this book and only for 
these elders (4:4, 10; 5:8; 11:16; 19:4). We do not really 
know why this number is chosen, perhaps two elders for 
each tribe, perhaps the twelve tribes and the twelve apostles 
(Judaism and Christianity), perhaps the twenty-four courses 
of the sons of Aaron (I Chron. 24:1-19), perhaps some angelic 
rank (Col. 1:16) of which we know nothing. Cf. Eph. 2:6. 
Sitting (kathémenous). Upon their thrones. Arrayed (peri- 
beblemenous). Perfect passive participle of peridalld (to 
throw around). In white garments (himatiois leukois). Loca- 
tive case here as in 3:5 (with ev), though accusative in 7:9, 
13. Crowns of gold (stephanous chrusous). Accusative case 
again like presbuterous after eidon (4:1), not idou. In 19:14 
echon (having) is added. John uses diadéma (diadem) for 
the kingly crown in 12:3; 13:1; 19:12, but it is not certain 
that the old distinction between diadem as the kingly crown 
and stephanos as the victor’s wreath is always observed in 
late Greek. 

5. Out of the throne (ek tou thronou). Back to the throne 
itself. The imagery is kin to that in Ex. 19:16; 24:9f.; 
Ezek. 1:22, 27. Proceed (ekporeuontai). Graphic historical 


328 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


present. Lightnings and voices and thunders (astrapai kat 
phonai kai brontai). So exactly in 11:19; 16:18, but in 8:5 
with drontai first, astrapai last, all old and common words. 
“The thunderstorm is in Hebrew poetry a familiar symbol 
of the Divine power: cf., e.g., I Sam. 2:10; Ps. 18:9f.; Job 
37:4f.” (Swete). Seven lamps of fire (hepta lampades puros). 
Return to the nominative (idou, not eidon) with ésan (were) 
understood. Metaphor drawn from Ezek. 1:13 and Zech. 
4:12ff. Our word “lamp,” but here a torch as in 8:10, 
identified with the Holy Spirit (the Seven Spirits of God) 
as in 1:4; 3:1, not /uchniai (lampstands) as in 1:12, 20, nor 
luchnos a hand-lamp with oil (Matt. 5:15). ‘‘These torches 
blaze perpetually before the throne of God” (Swete). 

6. As it were a glassy sea (hos thalassa hualiné). Old 
adjective (from hualos, glass, 21:18, 21), in N.T. only here 
and 15:2. Possibly from hwei (it rains), like a raindrop. 
At any rate here it is the appearance, not the material. 
Glass was made in Egypt 4,000 years ago. In Ex. 24:10 the 
elders see under the feet of God in the theophany a paved 
work of sapphire stone (cf. Ezek. 1:26). The likeness of the 
appearance of sky to sea suggests the metaphor here (Beck- 
with). Like crystal (homoia krustalloi). Associative-instru- 
mental case after homoia. Old word, from kruos (ice and 
sometimes used for ice), in N.T. only here and 22:1, not 
semiopaque, but clear like rock-crystal. In the midst of 
the throne (en mesoi tou thronou). As one looks from the © 
front, really before. Round about the throne (kukléi tou 
thronou). Merely an adverb in the locative case (Rom. 
15:19), as a preposition in N.T. only here, 5:11; 7:11. This 
seems to mean that on each of ihe four sides of the throne 
was one of the four living creatures either stationary or mov- 
ing rapidly round (Ezek. 1:12f.). Four living creatures 
(tessera z0a). Not théria (beasts), but living creatures. Cer- 
tainly kin to the zd¢ of Ezek. 1 and 2 which are cherubim 
(Ezek. 10:2, 20), though here the details vary as to faces 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 329 


and wings with a significance of John’s own, probably rep- 
resenting creation in contrast with the redeemed (the elders). 
Full of eyes (gemonta ophthalmon). Present active participle 
of gemé, to be full of, with the genitive, signifying here un- 
limited intelligence (Beckwith), the ceaseless vigilance of 
nature (Swete). 

7. Like a lion (homoion leonti). Associative-instrumental 
case again. In Ezek. (1:6, 10) each 200m has four faces, but 
here each has a different face. “The four forms represent 
whatever is noblest, strongest, wisest, and swiftest in na- 
ture” (Swete). But it is not necessary to try to find a 
symbolism in each face here like the early baseless identifica- 
tion with the Four Evangelists (the lion for Mark, the man 
for Matthew, the calf for Luke, the eagle for John). Moschos 
is first a sprout, then the young of animals, then a calf 
(bullock or heifer) as in Luke 15:23, 27, 30, or a full-grown 
ox (Ezek. 1:10). Had (echon). Masculine singular (some 
MSS. echon neuter singular agreeing with 2007) present ac- 
tive participle of echd, changing the construction with the 
triton zoon almost like a finite verb as in verse 8. 4 face 
as of a man (prosipon hos anthrépou). Shows that the like- 
ness in each instance extended only to the face. Like an 
eagle flying (homoion aetoi petomendi). Present middle par- 
ticiple of petomai, to fly, old verb, in N.T. only in Rev. 
4:7; 8:13; 12:14; 14:6; 19:17. The aetos in Matt. 24:28 and 
Luke 17:37 may be a form of vulture going after carrion, 
but not in Rev. 8:13; 12:14. 

8. Each one of them (hen kath’ hen auton). ‘““One by one 
of them,” a vernacular idiom like heis kata heis in Mark 
14:19. Having (echoén). Masculine participle again as in 
verse 7, though zdon neuter. Six wings (ana pterugas hex). 
Distributive use of ana, “‘six wings apiece” as in Luke 10:1 
(ana duo, by twos). Like Is. 6:2, not like Ezek. 1:6, where 
only four wings are given apiece. Are full of (gemousin), 
Plural verb, though zd¢ neuter, to individualize each one. 


330 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Round about and within (kuklothen kai esothen). Perhaps 
before and behind (4:6) and under the wings, “pointing to 
the secret energies of nature” (Swete). Rest (anapausin). 
See also 14:11. Old word (from anapaud, to relax), as in 
Matt. 11:29. God and Christ cease not their activity (John 
5:17). “This ceaseless activity of nature under the hand 
of God is a ceaseless tribute of praise” (Swete). Day and 
night (hémeras kai nuktos). Genitive of time, by day and 
by night. Holy, holy, holy (hagios, hagios, hagios). “The 
task of the Cherubim together with the Seraphim and 
Ophannim is to sing the praises of God” (Charles) in the 
trisagion (triple repetition of hagios). Is the Lord God 
(Kurios ho theos). See Is. 6:3. The copula estin (is) is not 
expressed, but is implied. The Almighty (ho pantokrator). 
See on 1:8. Which was and which is and which is to come 
(ho én kai ho in kai ho erchomenos). Just as in 1:4, 8, but 
with the order changed. 

9. When the living creatures shall give (hotan dosousin ta 
z0a). Indefinite temporal clause with hotan and the future 
active indicative (ddsousin) rather than the more common 
second aorist active subjunctive (ddsin) with the notion of 
repetition rather than unbroken continuance, “whenever 
they give.” The giving of praise and glory to God by the 
four living creatures (representatives of nature) is met by 
corresponding worship by the redeemed (the four and twenty . 
elders). “‘Created life adores the Uncreated”’ (Swete), “to 
the one living for ages of ages.” 

10. Shall fall down (pesountai, future middle of pipto), 
shall worship (proskunésousin, future active of proskuned), 
shall cast their crowns (balousin tous stephanous, future ac- 
tive of dallo). The two actions by the two groups (living 
creatures, elders) are codrdinated (simultaneous in the rep- 
etition). They thus acknowledge that all this kingly dig- 
nity comes from God, who is King of kings and Lord ‘of 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 331 


lords. Charles takes the elders, however, to be angels, not 
redeemed men. 

11. Our Lord and our God (ho kurios kai ho theos hémon). 
The nominative form here used as vocative as in John 20:28 
and often. To receive (Jabein). Epexegetic second aorist 
active infinitive of Jambano with axios (worthy). The glory 
(ten doxan). The article referring to doxan in verse g and 
so with fé7 timén (the honour), though ¢én dunamin (the 
power) is not in verse g, but is the power due to be ascribed 
to God. Thou didst create (su ektisas). Emphasis on su 
(thou), first aorist active indicative of ktizd, the verb used 
about the act of creation by Paul in Col. 1:16 (ektisthé, 
ektistai), constative aorist giving a summary picture of the 
whole (not as a process). Because of thy will (dia to thelema 
sou). Reason for creation of the universe as in Heb. 2:10 
(di’ hon). They were (@san). Imperfect tense with a cursory 
glance at the universe as a fact, possibly a potential ex- 
istence in God’s purpose in the eternal past before the actual 
creation in time. And were created (kai ektisthésan). First 
aorist passive indicative of the same verb, fiz0, just used 
and in the plural, while Paul (Col. 1:16) uses the singular 
ektisthe. See I Cor. 8:6. God’s will wrought through the 
Logos (Christ). 


GHAPTERGY 


1. In the right hand (epi tén dexian). “Upon the right 
hand”’ (epi, not ez), the open palm. Anthropomorphic lan- 
guage drawn from Ezek. 2:9f. 4 book (diblion). Diminu- 
tive of didlos, but no longer so used, diblaridion occurring 
instead (10:2). Written (gegrammenon). Perfect passive 
predicate participle of graphd. Within and on the back 
(esothen kai opisthen). ‘‘Within and behind.” Description 
of a roll like that in Luke 4:17, not a codex as some scholars 
think. Usually these papyrus rolls were written only on the 
inside, but this one was so full of matter that it was written 
also on the back side (opisthen), and so was an opisthographon 
like that in Ezek. 2:10. There are many allegorical interpre- 
tations of this fact which are all beside the point. Sealed 
(katesphragismenon). Perfect passive predicate participle of 
katasphragizo, old compound (perfective use of kata), to seal 
up (down), here only in N.T. With seven seals (sphragisin 
hepta). Instrumental case of sphragis, old word used in 
various senses, proof or authentication (I Cor. 9:2; Rom. 
4:11), signet-ring (Rev. 7:2), impression made by the seal 
(Rev. 9:4; II Tim. 2:19), the seal on books closing the book 
(Rev. 5:1, 2, 5, 93 6:1, 3, 5) 7, 9) 12; 8:1). “‘A will in Roman - 
law bore the seven seals of the seven witnesses”’ (Charles). 
But this sealed book of doom calls for no witnesses beyond 
God’s own will. Alford sees in the number seven merely 
the completeness of God’s purposes. 

2. 4 strong angel (aggelon ischuron). One needed (10:1; 
18:21) “whose call could reach to the farthest limits of the 
universe” (Beckwith) and so ‘“‘with a great voice” (en 
phonéi megaléi, in a great voice, as in 14:7, 9, 15, and with- 
out ¢” 5:12; 6:10; 7:2, 10; 8:13; 10:3, etc.). See en ischurai 

332 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 333 


phonéi (18:2). Proclaiming (kérussonta). Present active 
predicate participle of kérussd, to herald, to preach. Worthy 
to open and to loose (axios anoixai kai lusai). Worthy by 
rank and character (cf. John 1:27) as well as by ability 
(edunato, verse 3), followed by two infinitives (first aorist 
active) of anoigd and /ué, though hina and the subjunctive 
can be used after axios as in John 1:27. Here axios is like 
hikanos (capable, qualified) as in Matt. 8:8. The articles 
here (40, tas) refer to the book and the seals in verse 1. It 
is a husteron-proteron, since the loosing of the seals pre- 
cedes the opening of the book. 

3. En (in) with locative (ourandi), epi (apon) with geni- 
tive (gés), hupokato (under) with ablative (gés), as in verse 
13, including the whole universe, as in Ex. 20:4 (Phil. 2:10). 
The MSS. vary in the negative conjunctions after oudeis 
(no one) between oude—oude (continuative, and not—nor) 
and oute—oute (disjunctive, neither—nor). To look thereon 
(6lepein auto). Into the contents of the book. The uni- 
verse declines the challenge. 

4. I wept much (ego eklaion polu). Imperfect active of 
klaid, picturesque, descriptive, I kept on weeping much; 
natural tense in these vivid visions (1:12; 2:14; 5:4, 143 
6:8, 9; 10:10; 19:14; 21:15). Perhaps weeping aloud. Was 
found (heurethé). First aorist passive indicative of heurisko. 
Worthy (axios). Predicative nominative after heurethé. 

5. One of the elders (heis ek ton presbuteron). ‘““One from 
among the elders” of 4:4, 10 (ek with the ablative 8 times 
in the Apocalypse, 12 in the Fourth Gospel, 10 in rest of 
the N.T., in place of the mere partitive genitive). No par- 
ticular reason for one elder as the agent over another (7:13). 
Saith (legei). Dramatic vivid present. Weep not (mé kiaie). 
“Cease weeping” (prohibition with mé and the present ac- 
tive imperative of k/aid. The Lion (ho leon). Satan 1s 
called a lion by Peter (I Pet. 5:8), but the metaphor belongs 
to Jesus also. Judah is called a lion in the blessing of Jacob

(Gen. 49:9) and Jesus as the greatest of the tribe of Judah, 
“the Root of David” (hé riza Daueid, Is. 11:1, 10) or the 
Branch from this root (the Messiah). Hath overcome (ent- 
késen). First aorist active indicative of nikad, “did over- 
come,” coming first in the sentence as “the great historical 
fact of the victory of the Christ” (Swete). 

6. And I saw (kai eidon). Stirred by the words of the 
elder in verse 5 (idou, behold). “I beheld.” In the midst 
(en mesoi). See 4:6 for this idiom. It is not quite clear 
where the Lamb was standing in the vision, whether close 
to the throne or in the space between the throne and the 
elders (perhaps implied by “came” in verse 7, but nearness 
to the throne is implied by 14:1 and Acts 7:56; Heb. 10:11). 
A Lamb (arnion). Elsewhere in the N.T. 4o amnos is used 
of Christ (John 1:29, 36; Acts 8:32; I Pet. 1:19 like Is. 53:7), 
but in the Apocalypse fo arnion occurs for the Crucified 
Christ 29 times in twelve chapters. Standing (hestékos). 
Second perfect active (intransitive of Aist@mi) neuter ac- 
cusative singular (grammatical gender like arnion), though 
some MSS. read hestékés (natural gender masculine and 
nominative in spite of eidon construction according to sense). 
As though it had been slain (hos esphagmenon). Perfect pas- 
sive predicate participle of sphazd, old word, in N.T. only 
in Rev. 5:6, 9, 123 6:4, 93 13:3; 18:24; and I John 3:12. 
Hos (as if) is used because the Lamb is now alive, but (in 
appearance) with the marks of the sacrifice. The Christ as - 
the Lamb is both sacrifice and Priest (Heb. g:12f.; 10:11). 
Having (echon). Construction according to sense again with 
masculine nominative participle instead of echonta (mascu- 
line accusative singular) or echon (neuter accusative singular). 
Seven horns (keras) is a common symbol in the O.T. for 
strength and kingly power (I Sam. 2:10; I Kings 22:11; Ps. 
12:93"Dan.. 7:7; 20ff.)and: often in) Rev..(1223301g 15/1733} 
12). Fulness of power (the All-powerful one) is symbolized 
by seven. Seven eyes (ophthalmous hepta). Like Zech. 3:9; 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 335 


4:10 and denotes here, as there, omniscience. Here they 
are identified with the seven Spirits of Christ, while in 1:4 
the seven Spirits are clearly the Holy Spirit of God (3:1), 
and blaze like torches (4:5), like the eyes of Christ (1:14). 
The Holy Spirit is both Spirit of God and of Christ (Rom. 
8:9). Sent forth (apestalmenoi). Perfect passive predicate 
participle of apostelld, masculine plural (agreeing with hot 
and ophthalmous in gender), but some MSS. have apestal- 
mena agreeing with the nearer pneumata. 

7. He taketh (eil@éphen). Perfect active indicative of /am- 
bané, not used for the aorist (cf. 2/then, he came), but vivid 
dramatic picture of the actual scene, ‘“‘he has taken it.” 

8. He had taken (elaben). Were John drops back to the 
narrative tense (the second aorist active indicative of /am- 
bano), not the past perfect as the English rendering might 
indicate, merely “when he took.”’ For like vivid variation 
(not confusion) of tenses with ei/éphen see 3:3; 8:5; 11:17 and 
with eiréka in 7:13f.; 19:3. Fell down (epesan). Second 
aorist active indicative of piptd with first aorist (-az) ending, 
just “fell.” Having (echontes). “Holding.” Aharp (kitharan). 
Old word, the traditional instrument (lyre or zithern) for 
psalmody (Ps. 33:2; 98:5, etc.). Golden bowls (phialas 
chrusas). Broad shallow saucers, old word, in N.T. only 
in Rev. 5:8; 15:7; 16:1-4, 8, 10, 12, 17; 17:1; 21:9. Of 
incense (thumiamaton). Old word from thumiad, to burn 
incense (Luke 1:9), as in Luke 1:10. Which are (hai eisin). 
““Which (these bowls of incense) symbolize the prayers of 
the saints” as in Ps. 140:2; Luke 1:10. 

g. They sing (aidousin). Present active indicative of 
aido. Old verb, to chant with lyrical emotion (Col. 3:16. 
A new song (didén kainén). Cognate accusative for oide 
(did@, song) is Zoide from Geidd, that is dido (the verb used), 
old word already used (Col. 3:16; Eph. 5:19), called kainén 
because a fresh song for new mercies (Is. 42:10; Ps. 33:33 
4033, etc.), here in praise of redemption to Christ (14:3) like 


336 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


the new name (2:17; 3:12), the new Jerusalem (3:12; 21:2), 
the new heaven and the new earth (21:1), not the old song of 
creation (4:8, 11) toGod. For thou wast slain (hoti esphagés). 
Second aorist passive indicative of sphazd. Agorazd used by 
Paul and Peter of our purchase from sin by Christ (I Cor. 
Gr203h7223 Gal zinqeeyisss Ti PetmmengeciiiePersis 18192 
Unto God (toi thedi). Dative case of advantage as also in 
verse 10. With thy blood (en toi haimati sou). Instrumental 
use of em as in 1:5. The blood of Christ as the price of our 
redemption runs all through the Apocalypse. This is the 
reason why Christ is worthy to “take the book and open 
its seals.” That is, he is worthy to receive adoration and 
worship (4:11) as the Father does. Men of every (ek pasés). 
No anthropous (men) or tinas (some) before ek in the Greek. 
See a like ellipsis in 11:9 with a like grouping of words for 
all mankind, representatives of all races and nations (7:9; 
1BR7S) LAO) 

10. Madest (epoiésas). First aorist active indicative of 
poied, a prophetic use anticipating the final result. 4 king- 
dom and priests (basileian kai hiereis). As the correct text in 
1:6. They reign (basileuousin). Present active indicative, 
futuristic use, though Aleph P have the future Jasileusousin 
(shall reign) as in 20:6. 

11. And I saw (kai eidon). A new feature introduced by 
the outer and vaster circle (kuk/0i) of angels who catch up 
the new song of redemption in antiphonal singing, answering 
the song of the four living creatures and the twenty-four 
elders. Some MSS. read ds (as if) before phdnén (voice). 
Ten thousand times ten thousand (muriades muriadon kai 
chiliades chiliadon). Literally, “myriads of myriads and 
thousands of thousands,” a mild husteron-proteron. The 
regular order in I Enoch 40:1. See Dan. 7:10 for chiliai 
chiliades (thousand thousands) and muriai muriades (count- 
less myriads). They are all efforts to express the innumer- 
able hosts of the angels. 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 337 


12. Worthy (axion). Agreeing in gender (grammatical 
neuter) with arnion, but some MSS. have axios (masculine, 
natural gender). Note change to third person estin instead 
of second ei. The point of the song is the same as that in 
verses g and Io, but the language differs. Note the repeated 
article fo (the lamb the slain) referring to verses 6 and 9. 
Note also the one article #én before dunamin for all the seven 
grounds of praise (dunamin, power, plouton, wealth, sophian, 
wisdom, ischun, strength, timén, honor, doxan, glory, eulo- 
gian, blessing), though p/outon is masculine, in contrast with 
separate article for each item (all three feminine) in 4:11, 
here grouping them all together, “a heptad of praise” 
(Swete). 

13. Every created thing (pan ktisma). Every creature in a 
still wider antiphonal circle beyond the circle of angels 
(from ktizd, for which see I Tim. 4:4; James 1:18), from all 
the four great fields of life (in heaven, upon the earth, under 
the earth as in verse 3, with on the sea epi tés thalassés 
added). No created thing is left out. This universal 
chorus of praise to Christ from all created life reminds one 
of the profound mystical passage in Rom. 8:20-22 con- 
cerning the sympathetic agony of creation (kfisis) in hope 
of freedom from the bondage of corruption. If the trail of 
the serpent is on all creation, it will be ultimately thrown off. 
Saying (legontas). Masculine (construction according to 
sense, personifying the created things) if genuine, though 
some MSS. have J/egonta (grammatical gender agreeing with 
panta) present active participle of /egd, to say. And to the 
Lamb (kai toi arnidi). Dative case. Praise and worship 
are rendered to the Lamb precisely as to God on the throne. 
Note separate articles here in the doxology as in 4:11 and the 
addition of to kratos (active power) in place of ischus (reserve 
of strength) in 5:12. 

14. 4men (Amén). The four living creatures give their 
approval to the doxology after the antiphonal songs Fe/I 


338 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


down and worshipped (epesan kai prosekunésan). In silent 
adoration that closes the whole service of praise to the One 
upon the throne and to the Lamb. As in 4:10 so here the 
representatives of the redeemed bow in silent worship. 
Pliny says that the Christians sing a song to Christ as to 
God. He is here worshipped by the universe (Phil. 2:10f.). 


CHAPTER VI 


1. And I saw (kai eidon). As in 4:1; 5:1. The vision 
unfolds without anything being said about opening the book 
and reading from it. Ina more vivid and dramatic fashion 
the Lamb breaks the seals one by one and reveals the contents 
and the symbolism. The first four seals have a common 
note from one of the four za and the appearance of a horse. 
No effort will be made here to interpret these seals as refer- 
ring to persons or historical events in the past, present, or 
future, but simply to relate the symbolism to the other 
symbols in the book. It is possible that there is some allu- 
sion here to the symbolism in the so-called “Little Apoca- 
lypse” of Mark 13=Matt. 24f.= Luke 21. The imagery 
of the four horses is similar to that in Zech. 1:7-11; 6:1-8 
(ef Jer. 14:12; 24:10; 42217)/ In the Old Testament’ ‘the 
horse is often the emblem of war (Job 39:25; Ps. 76:6; 
Prov. 21:31; Ezek. 26:10). “‘Homer pictures the horses of 
Rhesus as whiter than snow, and swift as the wind” (Vin- 
cent). When the Lamb opened (hote énoixen to arnion). First 
aorist active indicative of anoigd. This same phrase recurs 
in rhythmical order at the opening of each seal (6:1, 3, 5,7, 9, 
12) till the last (8:1), where we have hotan énoixen (hotan 
rather than Aofe calling particular attention to it). One 
(mian). Probably used here as an ordinal (the first) as in 
Matt. 28:1. See Robertson, Grammar, p. 671f. Of (ek). 
This use of ek with the ablative in the partitive sense is 
common in the Apocalypse, as twice in this verse (ek #67, etc.). 
So henos ek ton (one of the four living creatures) is “‘the first 
of,” etc. In a voice of thunder (en phonéi brontes). Old word 
used of John and James (Mark 3:17) and elsewhere in N.T. 
only John 12:29 and a dozen times in the Apocalypse. 

339 


340 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Come (Erchou). Present middle imperative of erchomai, but 
with exclamatory force (not strictly linear). The command 
is not addressed to the Lamb nor to John (the correct text 
omits kai ide “and see”) as in 17:1; 21:9, but to one of the 
four horsemen each time. Swete takes it as a call to Christ 
because erchou is so used in 22:17, 20, but that is not con- 
clusive. 

2. And I saw and behold (kai eidon kai idou). This com- 
bination is frequent in the Apocalypse (4:1; 6:2, 5, 8; 14:1, 
14; 19:11). A white horse (hippos leukos). In Zech. 6:1-8 
we have red, black, white, and grizzled bay horses like the 
four winds of heaven, ministers to do God’s will. White 
seems to be the colour of victory (cf. the white horse of the 
Persian Kings) like the white horse ridden by the Roman 
conqueror in a triumphant procession. Had (echon). Agree- 
ing in gender and case with ho kathémenos. A bow (toxon). 
Old word (Zech. 9:13f. of a great bow), here only in N.T. 
Was given (edothé). First aorist passive indicative of didomi. 
A crown (stephanos). See on 4:4 for this word. He came 
forth (exélthen). Second aorist active indicative of exer- 
chomai, either to come out or to go out (went forth). 
Conquering (nikon). Present active participle of nikad. And 
to conquer (kai hina nikéséi). Purpose clause with hina and 
the first aorist active subjunctive of mikad. Here hos 
nikéson (future active participle with 40s) could have been 
used. The aorist tense here points to ultimate victory. . 
Commentators have been busy identifying the rider of the 
white horse according to their various theories. “It is 
tempting to identify him with the Rider on the white horse 
in 19:11f., whose name is ‘the Word of God’” (Swete). 
Tempting “but the two riders have nothing in common 
beyond the white horse.” 

3. The second seal (tén sphragida tén deuteran). ‘The 
seal the second.” The white horse with his rider vanished 
from the scene. bent on his conquering career. 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 341 


4. 4 red horse (hippos purros). Old adjective from pur 
(fire), flame-coloured, blood-red (II Kings 3:22), in N.T. 
only here and 12:3, like Zech. 1:8; 6:2 (roan horse). To take 
peace from the earth (labein tén eirénén ek tés gés). Second 
aorist active infinitive of Jamband, and here the nominative 
case, the subject of edothé (see verse 2), “‘to take peace out of 
the earth.” Alas, how many red horses have been ridden 
through the ages. dnd that they should slay one another (kat 
hina allélous sphaxousin). Epexegetical explanatory pur- 
pose clause with Aina and the future active of sphazd (5:6) 
instead of the more usual subjunctive (verse 2). Cf. Rob- 
ertson, Grammar, p. 998f. This is what war does to per-. 
fection, makes cannon fodder (cf. John 14:27) of men. 
A great sword (machaira megalé). Machaira may be a knife 
carried in a sheath at the girdle (John 18:10) or a long sword 
in battle as here. Romphaia, also a large sword, is the only 
other word for sword in the N.T. (Rev. 1:16; 2:12, 16; 6:85 
19%15, 21). 

5. A black horse (hippos melas). Lust of conquest brings 
bloodshed, but also famine and hunger. “The colour of 
mourning and famine. See Jer. 4:28; 8:21; Mal. 3:14, where 
mournfully is, literally, in black” (Vincent). Had (echon) 
as in verse 2. 4 balance (zugon). Literally, a yoke (old 
word from zeugnumi, to join), of slavery (Acts 15:10; Gal. 
s:1), of teaching (Matt. 11:29), of weight or measure like a 
pair of scales evenly balancing as here (Ezek. 5:1; 45:10). 
The rider of this black horse, like the spectral figure of 
hunger, carries in his hand a pair of scales. This is also one 
of the fruits of war. 

6. As it were a voice (hos phonén). ‘This use of hds, giving 
a certain vagueness or mysteriousness to a phrase, is one of 
the characteristics of the writer’s style, e.g., 8:1; 14:33 19:1, 
6” (Beckwith). This voice comes from the midst of the 
four living creatures, “‘the protest of nature against the 
horrors of famine” (Swete). 4 measure (choinix). Old word 


342 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


for less than a quart with us, here only in N.T. Of wheat 
(sitou). Old word for wheat, a number of times in N.T., 
in Rev. only here and 18:13. This was enough wheat to 
keep a man of moderate appetite alive for a day. For a 
penny (dénariou). Genitive of price, the wages of a day 
laborer (Matt. 20:2), about eighteen cents in our money 
today. Of barley (krithon). Old word krithé, usually in 
plural as here. Barley was the food of the poor and it was 
cheaper even in the famine and it took more of it to support 
life. Here the proportion is three to one (cf. II Kings 7:18). 
The proclamation forbids famine prices for food (solid and 
liquid). Hurt thou not (mé adikéséis). Prohibition with mé 
and the ingressive first aorist active subjunctive of adiked. 
See 7:3 and 9:4 for adiked for injury to vegetable life. “The 
prohibition is addressed to the nameless rider who represents 
Dearth” (Swete). Wheat and barley, oil and the vine, were 
the staple foods in Palestine and Asia Minor. 

8. A pale horse (hippos chloros). Old adjective. Con- 
tracted from chloeros (from chloé, tender green grass) used 
of green grass (Mark 6:39; Rev. 8:7; 9:4), here for yellowish, 
common in both senses in old Greek, though here only in 
N.T. in this sense, greenish yellow. We speak of a sorrel 
horse, never of a green horse. Zechariah (6:3) uses poikilos 
(grizzled or variegated). Homer used chléros of the ashen 
colour of a face blanched by fear (pallid) and so the pale 
horse is a symbol of death and of terror. His name was - 
Death (onoma autoi ho thanatos). Anacoluthon in gram- 
matical structure like that in John 3:1 (cf. Rev. 2:26) and 
common enough. Death is the name of this fourth rider (so 
personified) and there is with Death “his inseparable com- 
rade, Hades (1:16; 20:13f.)”” (Swete). Hades (Adidés, alpha 
privative, and idein, to see, the unseen) is the abode of the 
dead, the keys of which Christ holds (Rev. 1:18). Followed 
(2kolouthei). Imperfect active of akolouthed, kept step with 
death, whether on the same horse or on another horse by 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 343 


his side or on foot John does not say. Over the fourth part 
of the earth (epi to tetarton tes ges). Partitive genitive gés 
after fetarton. Wider authority (exousia) was given to this 
rider than to the others, though what part of the earth is 
included in the fourth part is not indicated. To kill (apok- 
teinat). Wirst aorist active infinitive of apokteind, explana- 
tion of the exousia (authority). The four scourges of Ezek. 
14:21 are here reproduced with instrumental en with the 
inanimate things (romphaidi, limoi thanatoi) and hupo for 
the beasts (théridn). Death here (thanatoi) seems to mean 
pestilence as the Hebrew does (/oimos—cf. limos famine). 
Cf. the “‘black death” for a plague. 

g. Under the altar (hupokato tou thusiastériou). “Under” 
(hupokato), for the blood of the sacrifices was poured at the 
bottom of the altar (Lev. 4:7). The altar of sacrifice (Ex. 
393393 40: 29), not of incense. The imagery, as in Hebrews, 
is from the tabernacle. For the word see Matt. 5:23f., often 
Me Rew 5 (8.sg39 5.00213 p 10 04218) 0627). or Thiscaltariin 
heaven is symbolic, of course, ‘the antitype for the tabernacle 
altar (Heb. 8:5). The Lamb was slain (5:6, 9, 12) and these 
martyrs have followed the example of their Lord. The souls 
(tas psuchas). The lives, for the life is in the blood (Lev. 
17:11), were given for Christ (Phil. 2:17; II Tim. 4:6). Of 
the slain (ton esphagmenon). See 5:6. Christians were slain 
during the Neronian persecution and now again under Do- 
mitian. A long line of martyrs has followed. For the word 
of God (dia ton logon tou theou). As in 1:9, the confession of 
loyalty to Christ as opposed to emperor-worship. nd for 
the testimony which they held (kai dia ten marturian hen 
eichon). See also 1:9. Probably kai equals “even” here, 
explaining the preceding. The imperfect tense eichon suits 
the repetition of the witness to Christ and the consequent 
death. 

10. How long (heds pote). “Until when.” Cf. Matt. 7:17; 
John 10:24. O Master (ho despotés). Nominative articular 


344 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


form, but used as vocative (despota) as in 4:11 (John 20:28). 
On despotes (correlative of doulos) see Luke 2:29. Here 
(alone in the Apocalypse) it is applied to God as in Luke 
2:29; Acts 4:24, but to Christ in Jude 4; II Pet. 2:1. The 
holy and true (ho hagios kai aléthinos). See 3:7 for these 
attributes of God. Avenge our blood on them that dwell upon 
the earth (ekdtkeis to haima hémon ek ton katotkounton epi tés 
gés). This same idiom in 19:2 and see it also in Luke 18 :7f., 
“a passage which goes far to answer many questions in the- 
odicy”’ (Swete). We find ekdiked, late compound, used with 
ek as here in Deut. 18:19; I Sam. 24:13, but with apo in 
Luke 18:3. For epi és gés (upon the earth) see 3:10. 

11. 4 white robe (stolé leuké). Old word from stellé, to 
equip, an equipment in clothes, a flowing robe (Mark 12:38). 
For the white robe for martyrs see 3:4f.; 4:43 7:9, 133 19:14. 
That they should rest (hina anapausontai). Sub-final clause 
with Aina and the future indicative (as in 3:9; 6:4) middle 
rather than the aorist middle subjunctive anapausontai of 
Aleph C. Yet for a little time (eti chronon mikron). Accusa- 
tive of extension of time as in 20:3. Perhaps rest from their 
cry for vengeance and also rest in peace (14:13). For the 
verb anapaud see on Matt. 11:28. Until should be fulfilled 
(heos plérothosin). Future indefinite temporal clause with 
heos and the first aorist passive subjunctive of p/érod, to fill 
full (Matt. 23:32; Col. 2:10), “until be filled full’? (the number 
of), regular Greek idiom. Which should be killed (hoi mel- - 
lontes apoktennesthai). Regular construction of articular 
present active participle of me//o (about to be, going to be) 
with the present passive infinitive of apoktennd, AKolic and 
late form for apokteind, to kill (also in Mark 12:5). John 
foresees more persecution coming (2:103 3:10). 

12. There was a great earthquake (seismos megas egeneto). 
“There came a great earthquake.” Jesus spoke of earth- 
quakes in his great eschatological discourse (Mark 13:8). 
In Matt. 24:29 the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 345 


Seismos is from seid, to shake, and occurs also in Rev. 8:5; 
11:13, 19; 16:18. The reference is not a local earthquake 
like those so common in Asia Minor. 4s sackcloth of hair 
(hos sakkos trichinos). Sakkos (Attic sakos), Latin saccus, 
English sack, originally a bag for holding things (Gen. 
42:25, 35), then coarse garment of hair (trichinos, old word 
from thrix, here only in N.T.) clinging to one like a sack, of 
mourners, suppliants, prophets leading austere lives (Matt. 
3:43 11:21; Luke 10:13). Here the hair is that of the black 
Boats (Iss) corg)iae Chaoeht2:10;! ozek.) 327h.godsy 13810; 
Mark 13:24f. See Eccl. 12:2 for eclipses treated as symbols 
of old age. Apocalyptic pictures all have celestial phe- 
nomena following earthquakes. 4s blood (hos haima). In 
Acts 2:20 we find Peter interpreting the apocalyptic eschato- 
logical language of Joel 2:31 about the sun being turned into 
darkness and the moon into blood as pointing to the events 
of the day of Pentecost as also ‘‘the great day of the Lord.” 
Peter’s interpretation of Joel should make us cautious about 
too literal an exegesis of these grand symbols. 

13. Her unripe figs (tous olunthous autés). An old word 
(Latin grossi) for figs that grow in winter and fall off in the 
spring without getting ripe (Song of Solomon 2:11f.), here 
only in N.T. Jesus used the fig tree (Mark 13:28) as a sign 
of the “end of the world’s long winter” (Swete). Cf. Is. 
34:4; Nah. 3:12. When she is shaken of a great wind (hupo 
anemou megalou seiomené). Present passive participle of 
seid, “being shaken by a great wind.” See Matt. 11:7 for 
the reed so shaken. 

14. Was removed (apechoristhé). First aorist passive in- 
dicative of apochorizd, to separate, to part (Acts 15:39). 
“The heaven was parted.” 4s a scroll when it is rolled up 
(hos biblion helissomenon). Present passive participle of 
helisso, old verb, to roll up, in N.T. only here (from Is. 34:4) 
and Heb. 1:12 (from Ps. 102:27). Vivid picture of the 
expanse of the sky rolled up and away as a papyrus roll 


346 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(Luke 4:17). Were moved (ekinéthésan). First aorist pas- 
sive indicative of kined, to move. Out of their places (ek ton 
topin auton). See also 16:20 for these violent displacements 
in the earth’s crust. Cf. Nah. 1:5 and Jer. 4:24. Jesus 
spoke of faith removing mountains (of difficulty) as in Mark 
prey (cfs Coreg). 

15. The princes (hoi megistanes). Late word from the 
superlative megistos, in LXX, Josephus, papyri, in N.T. only 
in Mark 6:21; Rev. 6:15; 18:23, for the grandees, the perse- 
cuting proconsuls (Swete). The chief captains (hoi chili- 
archoi). ‘The commanders of thousands, the military trib- 
unes (Mark 6:21; 19:18). The rich (hoi plousiot). Not 
merely those in civil and military authority will be terror- 
stricken, but the self-satisfied and complacent rich (James 
5:4f.). The strong (hoi ischuroi). Who usually scoff at fear. 
See the list in 13:16 and 19:18. Cf. Luke 21:26. Every 
bondman (pas doulos) and freeman (kai eleutheros). The two 
extremes of society. Hid themselves in the caves and in the 
rocks of the mountains (ekrupsan heautous eis ta spélaia kai eis 
tas petras ton oredn). Based on Is. 2:10, 18f. First aorist 
active indicative of krupto with the reflexive pronoun. For 
the old word spélaion see Matt. 21:13; Heb. 11:38. Oredn 
is the uncontracted Ionic form (for ordn) of the genitive 
plural of oros (mountain). 

16. They say (legousin). Vivid dramatic present active 
indicative, asisnatural here. Fallon us (Pesate eph’ hemas). - 
Second aorist (first aorist ending) imperative of piptd, tense 
of urgency, do it now. And hide us (kai krupsate hemas). 
Same tense of urgency again from krup/o (verb in verse 15). 
Both imperatives come in inverted order from Hos. 10:8 
with kalupsate (cover) in place of krupsate (hide), quoted by 
Jesus on the way to the Cross (Luke 23:30) in the order here, 
but with kalupsate, not krupsate. From the face of him that 
(apo prosdpou tou, etc.). ‘“What sinners dread most is not 


death, but the revealed Presence of God” (Swete). Cf. Gen. 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 347 


3:8. And from the wrath of the Lamb (kai apo tes orgés tou 
arniou). Repetition of “the grave irony” (Swete) of 5:5f. 
The Lamb is the Lion again in the terribleness of his wrath. 
Recall the mourning in 1:7. See Matt. 25:41ff. where Jesus 
pronounces the woes on the wicked. 

17. The great day (hé .hémera hé megalé). The phrase 
occurs in the O.T. prophets (Joel 2:11, 31; Zeph. 1:14. Cf. 
Jude 6) and is here combined with “of their wrath”? (¢és 
orgés auton) as in Zeph. 1:15, 18; 2:3; Rom. 2:5. “Their” 
(auton) means the wrath of God and of the Lamb put here 
on an equality as in 1:17f., 22:3, 13; as in I Thess. 3:11; 
II Thess. 2:16. Beckwith holds that this language about 
the great day having come “is the mistaken cry of men in 
terror caused by the portents which are bursting upon them.” 
There is something, to be sure, to be said for this view which 
denies that John commits himself to the position that this 
is the end of the ages. And who is able to stand? (kai tis 
dunatat stathenai?). Very much like the words in Nah. 1:6 
and Mal. 3:2. First aorist passive infinitive of Aist@mi. It 
is a rhetorical question, apparently by the frightened crowds 
of verse 15. Swete observes that the only possible answer 
to that cry is the command of Jesus in Luke 21:36: “Keep 
awake on every occasion, praying that ye may get strength 
to stand (stathénai, the very form) before the Son of Man.” 


CHAPTER VII 


1. “After this (meta touto). Instead of the seventh seal (8:1) 
being opened, two other episodes or preliminary visions 
occupy chapter 7 (the sealing of the servants of God 7:1-8 
and the vision of the redeemed before the throne 7:9-17). 
Standing (hestotas). Second perfect predicate participle of 
histémi, intransitive and followed by epi and the accusative 
case gontas as already in 3:20 (epi thurian) and often again 
(8:3 some MSS., others genitive; 11:11; 12:18; 14:1; 15:2), 
but note epi with genitive ¢halassés in the next clause, like 
epi kephalés in 12:1 and in 7:3. Corners (gonias). Old word 
for angle (Matt. 6:5), also in 20:8. Holding (kratountas). 
Present active participle of krated, to hold fast (Mark 7:3; 
John 20:23). The four winds (cf. Matt. 24:31) are held 
prisoner by angels at each of the four corners. Some Jews 
held the winds from due north, south, east, west to be favour- 
able, while those from the angles (see Acts 27:14) were un- 
favourable (Charles). There is an angel of the fire (14:18) 
and an angel of the waters (16:5). That no wind should blow 
(hina mé pneéi anemos). Negative purpose clause with hina 
mé and the present active subjunctive, “lest a wind keep on 
blowing.” Upon any tree (epi pan dendron). Accusative 
case here with epi rather than the preceding genitives (gés, 
thalassés), ““upon the land or upon the sea,” but “against 
any tree” (picture of attack on the tree like a tornado’s 
path). 

2. Ascend (anabainonta). Present active participle of 
anabaino, “ascending,” “‘going up,” picturing the process. 
From the sun-rising (apo anatolés héliou). Same phrase in 
16:12. From the east, though why is not told. Swete sug- 
gests it is because Palestine is east of Patmos. The plural 

348 : 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 349 


apo anatolon occurs in Matt. 2:1 without Aé/iou (sun). The 
seal of the living God (sphragida theou xontos). Here the 
signet ring, like that used by an Oriental monarch, to give 
validity to the official documents. The use of zdntos with 
theou accents the eternal life of God (1:18; 10:6; 15:7) as 
opposed to the ephemeral pagan gods. To whom it was given 
(hots edothé autois). For edothé see on 6:2, 4, etc. The repe- 
tition of autois in addition to hois (both dative) is a redun- 
dant Hebraism (in vernacular Koiné to some extent) often 
in the Apocalypse (3:8). The angels are here identified with 
the winds as the angels of the churches with the churches 
(1:20). To hurt (adikésai). First aorist active infinitive of 
adikeo, subject of edothé, common use of adiked in this sense 
of to hurt in the Apocalypse (2:11; 6:6 already), in Luke 
10:19 also. The injury is to come by letting loose the winds, 
not by withholding them. 

3. Hurt not (mé adikéséte). Prohibition with mé and the 
ingressive aorist active subjunctive of adiked, not to begin to 
hurt. Till we shall have sealed (achri sphragisomen). Tem- 
poral clause of indefinite action for the future with achri 
(sometimes achris hou or achris hou an) and the aorist sub- 
junctive as in 15:8; 20:3, 5 or the future indicative (17:7), 
usually with the notion of ascent (up to) rather than extent 
like mechri. An (modal) sometimes occurs, but it is not 
necessary. But there is no futurum exactum idea in the 
aorist subjunctive, simply “till we seal,” not ‘‘till we shall 
have sealed.” Upon their foreheads (epi tin metopon). From 
Ezek. 9:4. Old word (meta, Gps, after the eye, above the 
eye, the space above or between the eyes), in N.T. only in 
the Apocalypse (7:3; 9:43 13:16; 14:1, 93 17:5; 20:4; 22:4). 
For “the servants of God” (tous doulous tou theou) who are 
to be thus marked linked with angels in the service of God 
seewRevent 113722805 (1gity §9122:95 6. 

4. The number of the sealed (ton arithmon ton esphragis- 
menon). Accusative case object of ékousa and genitive of 


350 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


the perfect passive articular participle of sphragizo. He did 
not see the sealing or count them himself, but only heard. 
A hundred and forty and four thousand (hekaton tesserakonta 
tessares chiliades). Symbolical, of course, and not meant 
to be a complete number of the sealed (or saved) even in 
that generation, let alone for all time. The number con- 
notes perfection (Alford), 12X12 X100o=a hundred and 
forty-four thousands (chiliades, 5:11). Nominative abso- 
lute, not agreeing in case either with arithmon (accusative) 
or esphragismenon (genitive). So as to the case of esphra- 
gismenot. Out of every tribe of the children of Israel (ek pasés 
phules huion Israel). ‘There are two opposite views here, 
one taking the sealed as referring only to Jews (either actual 
Jews as a remnant or just Jewish Christians), the other 
including Gentiles as well as Jewish Christians, that is the 
true Israel as in 2:9; 3:9ff. and like Paul in Galatians and 
Romans. This is the more probable view and it takes the 
twelve tribes in a spiritual sense. But in either view there 
remains the difficulty about names of the tribes. The list is 
not geographical, since Levi is included, but Dan is omitted 
and Manasseh put in his place, though he as the son of 
Joseph is included in Joseph. Irenzeus suggested that Anti- 
christ was expected to come from the tribe of Dan and hence 
the omission here. There are various lists of the tribes in 
the O.T. (Gen. 35:22f.; 46:8ff., 49; Ex. 1:1ff.; Num. 1:2; 
13:4ff.; 26:34; Deut. 27:11f.; 33:6ff.; Josh. 13-22; Judges 5; © 
I Chron. 2-8; 12:24ff.; 27:16ff.; Ezek. 48) and given in 
various orders. In I Chron. 7:12 both Dan and Zebulon 
areomitted. Joseph is given herein placeof Ephraim. The 
distribution is equal (12,000) to each tribe. 

9. Which no man could number (hon arithmésai auton 
oudeis edunato). Redundant repetition of the pronoun auton 
after the relative hon as in 7:5 and 3:8. Edunato imperfect 
indicative and arithmésai first aorist active infinitive of 
arithmed, old verb, in N.T. only here, Matt. 10:30; Luke 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 351 


12:7. See §:9 (also 11:9; 13:73; 14:10; 17:15) for the list of 
words after ek (the spiritual Israel carried on all over the 
world), “a polyglott cosmopolitan crowd” (Swete). Stand- 
ing (hestotes). Same form in 7:1, only nominative masculine 
plural referring to ochlos (masculine singular), construction 
according to sense like the plural /egonton with ochlou in 
19:1. Arrayed (peribeblémenous). Perfect passive partici- 
ple of peridallo, but in the accusative plural (not nominative 
like hestdtes), a common variation in this book when pre- 
ceded by eidon and idou as in 4:4 (thronoi, presbuterous). 
Charles regards this as a mere slip which would have been 
changed to peribeblemenoi if John had read the MS. over. 
In white robes (stolas leukas). Predicate accusative retained 
with this passive verb of clothing as in 7:13; 10:1; 11:3; 12:1; 
17:4; 18:16; 19:13. Palms (phoinikes). Nominative again, 
back to construction with idou, not eidon. Old word, in 
N.T. only here for palm branches and John 12:13 for palm 
trees. Both these and the white robes are signs of victory 
and joy. 

10. They cry (krazousi). Vivid dramatic present. With 
a great voice (phonéi megaléi). As in 6:10; 7:2. “The poly- 
glott multitude shouts its praises as with one voice” (Swete). 
Salvation (hé soteria). Asin 12:10;19:1. Nominative abso- 
lute. Salvation here is regarded as an accomplished act on 
the part of those coming out of the great tribulation (verse 
14) and the praise for it is given to God (#02 thedi, dative 
case) and to the Lamb (di arnidi, dative also). Both God 
and Christ are thus called sdtér as in the Pastoral Epistles, as 
to God (I Tim. 1:1; 2:3; Titus 1:3; 3:4) and to Christ 
(Titus 1:4; 2:13; 3:6). For hé sdtéria see John 4:22; Acts 
4:12; Jude 3. 

11. Were standing (histekeisan). Past perfect active of 
histémi intransitive and used like an imperfect as in John 
19:26. Round about (kuklot). Preposition (in a circle) with 
genitive as in 4:6; 5:11. The angels here rejoice in the sal- 


352 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


vation of men (Luke 15:7, 10; 1 Pet. 1:12). Upon their faces 
(epi ta prosdpa auton). In reverential worship of God as in 
11:16. For this worship (fell and worshipped) see also 
4:10; $:14; 11:16; 19:4, 10; 22:8. The dative 407 theoi (God) 
with proskuned (to worship) is the usual construction for 
that meaning. When it means merely to do homage the 
accusative case is usual in this book (Charles). But in the 
Fourth Gospel the reverse order is true as to the cases with 
proskuneo (Abbott, Foh. Vocab. pp. 138-142). 

12. Note amén at the beginning and the close of the 
doxology. Note also separate feminine article with each of 
the seven attributes given God, as in 4:11; 5:12, 13. 

13. Answered (apekrithé). First aorist passive (depo- 
nent) of apokrinomai with legon (saying), a common (only 
here in the Apocalypse) Hebrew redundancy in the Gospels 
(Mark 9:5). An elder intervenes, though no question has 
been asked to interpret the vision (Swete). These (houtoi). 
Prophetic predicate nominative put before tines eisin (who 
are they). Note article repeated with stolas pointing to 
verse g, and accusative also retained after peribeblémenoi as 
there. Both “who” and “whence” as in Josh. 9:8. 

14. I say (eireka). Perfect active indicative of eipon, “I 
have said.” ‘‘To the Seer’s mind the whole scene was still 
fresh and vivid” (Swete) like kekragen in John 1:15 and 
eiléphen in Rev. §:7, not the so-called “aoristic perfect” 
which even Moulton (Pro/. p. 145) is disposed to admit. ~ 
My lord (Kurie mou). “An address of reverence to a heav- 
enly being” (Vincent), not an act of worship on John’s 
part. Thou knowest (su oidas). ‘‘At once a confession of 
ignorance, and an appeal for information” (Swete), not of 
full confidence like su oidas in John 21:15ff. They which 
come out of the great tribulation (hoi erchomenoi ek tes thlipseos 
tes megalés). Present middle participle with the idea of 
continued repetition. ‘“‘The martyrs are still arriving from 
the scene of the great tribulation” (Charles). Apparently 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 353 


some great crisis is contemplated (Matt. 13:toff.; 24:21; 
Mark 13:10), though the whole series may be in mind and 
so may anticipate final judgment. dnd they washed (kai 
eplunan). First aorist active indicative of plund, old verb, 
to wash, in N.T. only Luke 5:2; Rev. 7:14; 22:14. This 
change of construction after hoi erchomenoi from hoi plun- 
ésantes to kai eplunan is common in the Apocalypse, one of 
Charles’s Hebraisms, like kai epoiésen in 1:6 and kai planai 
in 2:20. Made them white (eleukanan). First aorist active 
indicative of /eukaind, to whiten, old verb from Jeukos 
(verse 13), in N.T. only here and Mark 9:3. “Milligan 
remarks that rodes are the expression of character, and com-- 
pares the word Aadit used of dress” (Vincent). The lan- 
guage here comes partly from Gen. 49:11 and partly from 
Ex. 19:10, 14. For the cleansing power of Christ’s blood 
seetalsonhoniiegsegsisngsColinr 20: kph une7; lo Peteias23 
Hebott4mand In Johns tz; Reveotss3g29p 02:14. fol the 
aorists look back to the life on earth when the cleansing 
was effected”’ (Swete). See Phil. 2:12f. for both divine and 
human aspects of salvation. In the blood of the Lamb (en 
toi haimati tou arniou). There is power alone in the blood 
of Christ to cleanse from sin {I John 1:7), not in the blood 
of the martyrs themselves. The result is “white,” not 
“red,” as one might imagine. 

15. Therefore (dia touto). Because of the washing de- 
scribed in verse 14. They serve him (latreuousin autot). 
Dative case with /atreud (present active indicative, old verb, 
originally to serve for hire /atron, then service in general, 
then religious service to God, Matt. 4:10, then in particular 
ritual worship of the priests, Heb. 8:5). All the redeemed. 
are priests (Rev. 16:5, 10) in the heavenly temple (6:9) as 
here. But this service is that of spiritual worship, not of 
external rites (Rom. 12:1; Phil. 3:3). Day and night (hém- 
eras kai nuktos). Genitive of time, “by day and night,” 
as in 4:8 of the praise of the four living creatures. Shall 


354 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


spread his tabernacle over them (skénosei ep’ autous). Future 
«change of tense from present in /atreuousin) active of 
skénoo, old verb from skénos (tent, tabernacle), used in 
John 1:14 of the earthly life of Christ, elsewhere in N.T. 
only in Rev. (7:14; 12:12; 13:6; 21:3). In 12:12 and 13:6 
of those who dwell in tents, here of God spreading his tent 
“over” (ep’ autous) the redeemed in heaven, in 21:3 of 
God tabernacling “with” (me? auton) the redeemed, in both 
instances a picture of sacred fellowship, and “the further 
idea of God’s Presence as a protection from all fear of evil”’ 
(Swete) like the overshadowing of Israel by the Shekinah 
and a possible allusion also to the tents (skéai) of the feast 
of tabernacles and to the tent of meeting where God met 
Moses (Ex. 33:7-11). 

16. They shall hunger no more (ou peinasousin eti). Fu- 
ture tense of peinad, old verb with late form instead of 
peinésousin like Luke 6:25. It is a free translation of Is. 
49:10 (not quotation from the LXX). Neither thirst any 
more (oude dipsésousin eti). Future tense of dipsad, the 
ewo strong human appetites will be gone, a clear refutation 
of a gross materialistic or sensual conception of the future 
dfe. Cf. John 6:35. Neither shall strike (oude mé peséi). 
Strong double negative oude mé with second aorist active 
subjunctive of pipto, to fall. They will no longer be under 
the rays of the sun as upon earth. Nor any heat (oude pan 
kauma). Old word from kaié, to burn, painful and burning - 
heat, in N.T. only here and 16:9 (picture of the opposite 
condition). The use of the negative with pam (all) for “not 
any” is common in N.T. Cf. Ps. 121:6. 

17. In the midst (ana meson). In 5:6 we have en mesdi 
fou thronou as the position of the Lamb, and so that is ap- 
parently the sense of ana meson here as in Matt. 13:25, 
though it can mean “between,” as clearly so in I Cor. 6:5. 
Shall be their shepherd (paimanei autous). ‘Shall shepherd 
them,” future active of poimaind (from poimén, shepherd), 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 355 


in John 21:16; Acts 20:28; I Pet. 5:2; Rev. 2:27; 7:17; 
12:5; 19:15. Jesus is still the Good Shepherd of his sheep 
(John to:11, 14ff.). Cf. Ps. 23:1. Snall guide them (hode- 
gései autous). Future active of hodéged, old word (from 
hodégos, guide, Matt. 15:14), used of God’s guidance of 
Israel (Ex. 15:13), of God’s guidance of individual lives 
(Ps. 5:9), of the guidance of the Holy Spirit (John 16:13), 
of Christ’s own guidance here (cf. John 14:4; Rev. 14:4). 
Unto fountains of waters of life (epi zoes pégas hudaton). 
The language is like that in Is. 49:10 and Jer. 2:13. Note 
the order, “‘to life’s water springs” (Swete) like the Vulgate 
ad vite fontes aquarum, with emphasis on 2éés (life’s). For- 
this idea see also John 4:12, 14; 7:38f.; Rev. 21:6; 22:1, 17. 
No special emphasis on the plural here or in 8:10; 14:7; 
16:4. And God shall wipe away (kai exaleipsei ho theos). 
Repeated in 21:4 from Is. 25:8. Future active of exaleipho, 
old compound, to wipe out (ex), off, away, already in 3:5 
for erasing a name and in Acts 3:19 for removing the stain 
(guilt) of sin. Every tear (pan dakruon). Old word, with 
other form, dakru, in Luke 7:38, 44. Note repetition of ek 
with ophthalmén (out of their eyes). “Words like these of 
vv. 15-17 must sound as a divine music in the ears of the 
persecuted. God will comfort as a mother comforts” 


(Baljon). 


CHAPTER VIII 


1. And when he opened (kai hotan énoixen). Were modal 
an is used with hote (used about the opening of the preceding 
six seals), but Aotan is not here rendered more indefinite, as 
is sometimes true (Mark 3:11; Rev. 4:9), but here and pos- 
sibly (can be repetition) in Mark 11:19 it is a particular 
instance, not a general rule (Robertson, Grammar, p. 973). 
There followed a silence (egeneto sigé). Second aorist middle 
of ginomai. ‘“‘There came silence.” Dramatic effect by this 
profound stillness with no elder or angel speaking, no chorus 
of praise nor cry of adoration, no thunder from the throne 
(Swete), but a temporary cessation in the revelations. See 
10:4. About the space of half an hour (hos hémioron). Late 
and rare word (hémi, half, hora, hour), here only in N.T. 
Accusative of extent of time. 

2. Stand (hestekasin). Perfect active of hist@mi (intransi- 
tive). Another “hebdomad” so frequent in the Apocalypse. 
The article (the seven angels) seems to point to seven well- 
known angels. In Enoch 20:7 the names of seven archangels 
are given (Uriel, Raphael, Raguel, Michael, Sariel, Gabriel, 
Remiel) and “angels of the Presence”’ is an idea like that 
in Is. 63:9. We do not know precisely what is John’s idea - 
here. Seven trumpets (hepta salpigges). We see trumpets 
assigned to angels in Matt. 24:31; I Thess. 4:16; I Cor. 
15:52; Rev. 4:1, 4. See also the use of trumpets in Josh. 
6:13; Joel 2:1. These seven trumpets are soon to break the 
half-hour of silence. Thus the seven trumpets grow out of 
the opening of the seventh seal, however that fact is to be 
interpreted. . 

3. Another angel (allos aggelos). Not one of the seven of 
verse 2 and before they began to sound the trumpets. This

preliminary incident of the offering of incense on the altar 
covers verses 3 to 6. Stood (estathé). Ingressive first aorist 
passive of Aistémi (intransitive), “took his place.” Over the 
altar (epi tou thusiastériou). See 6:9 for the word for the 
burnt-offering, here apparently the altar of incense (clearly 
so in Luke 1:11; possibly also Rev. 9:13), but it is not clear 
that in apocalyptic the distinction between the two altars 
of the tabernacle and temple is preserved. Aleph C Q have 
the genitive, while A P have the accusative epi to thusiasté- 
rion. A golden censer (libaniton chrusoun). Old word for 
frankincense (from /ibanos, Matt. 2:11; Rev. 18:13), but here 
alone in N.T. and for censer, as is plain by the use of chrusoun - 
(golden) with it. Cf. I Kings 7:50. Much incense (thumt- 
amata polla). See 5:8 for thumiama (the aromatic substance 
burnt, also in 18:13), but here for the live coals on which 
the incense falls. That he should add (hina dosei). Sub-final 
clause (subject of edothé, was given, singular because ¢humt- 
amata neuter plural) with hina and the future active indica- 
tive of didémi, to give, instead of ddi, the second aorist 
subjunctive. Unto the prayers (tais proseuchais). Dative 
case. In 5:18 the thumiamata are the prayers. Upon the 
golden altar (epi to thusiastérion to chrusoun to). Accusative 
case here, not genitive as above, and apparently the altar 
of incense as indicated by the word golden (Ex. 30:1ff.; Lev. 
4:17). Note triple article here fo (once before the substan- 
tive, once before the adjective, once before the adjunct “the 
one before the throne”). 

4. The smoke (ho kapnos). Old word, in N.T. only Acts 
2:19 and Rev. 8:4; 9:2f., 17f.; 14:11; 15:8; 18:9, 18; 19:3. 
Here from the incense in the angel’s hand. With the prayers 
(tais proseuchais). So associative-instrumental case, but it 
may be dative as in verse 3 (for). 

s. Taketh (ciléphen). Vivid dramatic perfect active in- 
dicative of Jambani as in §:7, “has taken.” The angel had 
apparently laid aside the censer. Hardly merely the pleo-

nastic use of /ambano (John 19:23). John pictures the scene 
for us. Filled (egemisen). He drops back to the narrative 
use of the first aorist active indicative of gemizo. With the 
Jire (ek tou puros), live coals from the altar (cf. Is. 6:6). 
Cast (ebalen). Second aorist active indicative of dal/d. See 
Gen. 19:24 (Sodom); Ezek. 10:2 and Christ’s bold metaphor 
in Luke 12:49. See this use of da//é also in Rev. 8:7; 12:4, 
9, 13; 14:19. Followed (egenonto). Came to pass naturally 
after the casting of fire on the earth. Same three elements 
in 4:5, but in different order (lightnings, voices, thunders), 
lightning naturally preceding thunder as some MSS. have 
it here. Perhaps phdnai, the voices of the storm (wind, etc.). 

6. Prepared themselves (hétoimasan hautous). First aorist 
active indicative of hetoimazod. They knew the signal and 
got ready. To sound (hina salpisosin). Sub-final (object) 
clause with hina and the first aorist ingressive active sub- 
junctive of sa/pizd. The infinitive could have been used. 

7. Sounded (esalpisen). First aorist active indicative of 
salpizo, repeated with each angel in turn (8:8, 10, 12; 9:1, 
13; 11:15). Hail and fire mingled with blood (chalaza kai pur 
memigmena en haimati). Like the plague of hail and fire in 
Ex. 9:24. The first four trumpets are very much like the 
plagues in Egypt, this one like a semitropical thunderstorm 
(Swete) with blood like the first plague (Ex. 7:17ff.; Ps. 
106:35). The old feminine word chalaza (hail) is from the . 
verb chalad, to let down (Mark 2:4), in N.T. only in Rey. 
8:7; 11:19; 16:21. The perfect passive participle memigmena 
(from mignumi, to mix) is neuter plural because of pur (fire). 
Were cast (eblethé). First aorist passive singular because 
chalaza and pur treated as neuter plural. “The storm flung 
itself on the earth” (Swete). Was burnt up (katekaé@). Sec- 
ond aorist (effective) passive indicative of katakaid, old verb 
to burn down (effective use of kata, up, we say). Repeated 
here three times for dramatic effect. See 7:1-3 about the 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 359 


trees and 9:4 where the locusts are forbidden to injure the 
grass. 

8. As it were (hos). “As if,” not a great mountain, but 
a blazing mass as large as a mountain. Burning with fire 
(puri kaiomenon). Present middle participle of kaid. Some- 
what like Enoch 18:13, but perhaps with the picture of a 
great volcanic eruption like that of Vesuvius in A.D. 79. 
Strabo tells of an eruption B.c. 196 which made a new island 
(Palea Kaumene). Became blood (egeneto haima). Like the 
Nile in the first plague (Ex. 7:20ff.). Cf. also 16:3. 

g. Of the creatures (ton ktismaton). See 5:13 for this word 
ktisma. Even they that had life (ta echonta psuchas). Here 
the nominative articular participle is in apposition with the 
genitive ktismaton, as often in this book. See Ex. 7:20 for 
the destruction of fish, and Zeph. 1:3. Was destroyed 
(diephtharésan). Second aorist passive indicative of dia- 
phtheird, old compound, to corrupt, to consume, to destroy 
(perfective use of dia), also 11:18. The plural ploion just 
before the verb makes the idea plural. 

10. Burning as a torch (kaiomenos his lampas). See 4:5 
and Matt. 2:2, perhaps a meteor, striking at the fresh-water 
supply (rivers potamén, springs pégas) as in the first Egyp- 
tian plague also. 

11. Wormwood (ho Apsinthos). Absinthe. Usually fem- 
inine (42), but masculine here probably because aséér 1s 
masculine. Only here in N.T. and not in LXX (pikria, 
bitterness, cholé, gall, etc.) except by Aquila in Prov. 5:4; 
Jer. 9:15: 23:15. There are several varieties of the plant 
in Palestine. Became wormwood (egeneto eis apsinthon). 
This use of eis in the predicate with ginomai is common in 
the LXX and the N.T. (16:19; John 16:20; Acts 5:36). Of 
the waters (ek ton hudaton). As a result of (ek) the use of 
the poisoned waters. Were made bitter (epikranthésan). 
First aorist passive indicative of pikraind. Old verb (from 


360 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


pikros, bitter), as in to:gf. In a metaphorical sense to 
embitter in Col. 3:19. 

12. Was smitten (eplége). Second aorist passive indica- 
tive of pléssd, old verb (like plégé@ plague), here only in 
N.T. That should be darkened (hina skotisthéi). Purpose 
clause with Aina and the first aorist passive subjunctive of 
Skotizd, from skotos (darkness) as in Matt. 24:29, but skotod 
in Rev. 9:2. And the day should not shine (kai hé hémera 
mé phanéi). Negative purpose clause with hina mé and the 
first aorist active subjunctive of phaind, to shed light upon, 
as in 18:23, not the second aorist passive subjunctive phanéi 
with different accent. The eclipse here is only partial and 
is kin to the ninth Egyptian plague (Ex. 10:21). 

13. An eagle (henos aetou). ‘One eagle,” perhaps henos 
(heis) used as an indefinite article (9:13; 18:21; 19:17). See 
4:7 also for the flying eagle, the strongest of birds, some- 
times a symbol of vengeance (Deut. 28:49; Hos. 8:1; Hab. 
1:8). Flying in mid-heaven (petomenou en mesouranémati). 
Like the angel in 14:6 and the birds in 19:17. Mesouranéma 
(from mesouraned to be in mid-heaven) is a late word 
(Plutarch, papyri) for the sun at noon, in N.T. only these 
three examples. This eagle is flying where all can see, and 
crying so that all can hear. Woe, woe, woe (ouai, ouai, ouai). 
Triple because three trumpets yet to come. In 18:10, 16, 
19 the double ouai is merely for emphasis. For them that 
dwell on the earth (tous katoikountas). Accusative of the ~ 
articular present active participle of katoiked, is unusual 
(Aleph Q here and also in 12:12) as in Matt. 11:21. There 
Is even a nominative in 18:10. By reason of the other voices 
(ck ton loipon phonon). “As a result of (ek) the rest of the 
voices.” There is more and worse to come, “of the three 
angels who are yet to sound” (ton tridn aggelon tin mellonton 
salpizein). 


CHAPTER IX 


1. Fallen (peptokota). Perfect active participle of pipso, 
already down. In Luke 10:18 note pesonta (constative 
aorist active, like a flash of lightning) after ethedroun and 
in Rev. 7:2 note anabainonta (present active and linear, 
coming up, picturing the process) after eidon. Of the pit 
of the abyss (tou phreatos tés abussou). Abussos is an old 
adjective (alpha privative and duthos, depth, without depth), - 
but 2 abussos (supply chéra place), the bottomless place. 
It occurs in Rom. 10:7 for the common receptacle of the 
dead for Hades (Sheol), but in Luke 8:31 a lower depth is 
sounded (Swete), for the abode of demons, and in this sense 
it occurs in Rev. 9:1, 2, 11; 11:7; 17:8; 20:1, 3. Phrear is 
an old word for well or cistern (Luke 14:5; John 4:11f.) and 
it occurs in Rev. g:1f. for the mouth of the abyss which is 
pictured as a cistern with a narrow orifice at the entrance 
and this fifth angel holds the key to it. 

2. Opened (énoixen). First aorist active indicative of 
anoignumi. With the “key” (kleis). As the smoke of a 
great furnace (hos kapnos kaminou megalés). The plague of 
demonic locusts is here turned loose. Kaminos is old word 
for a smelting-furnace, already in 1:15. Were darkened 
(eskotothé). First aorist passive indicative of skotod, old 
causative verb from skotos, in N.T. only here, 16:10; Eph. 
4:18. By reason of (ek). “Out of,” as a result of (8:13). 

3. Locusts (akrides). Also verse 7 and already in Matt. 
3:4; Mark 1:6 (diet of the Baptist). The Israelites were 
permitted to eat them, but when the swarms came like the 
eighth Egyptian plague (Ex. 10:13ff.) they devoured every 
green thing. The smoke was worse than the fallen star 
and the locusts that came out of the smoke were worse 

361 


362 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


still, “a swarm of hellish locusts” (Swete). The scorpions 
(hoi skorpioi). Old name for a little animal somewhat like 
a lobster that lurks in stone walls in warm regions, with a 
venomous sting in its tail, in N.T. in Luke 10:19; 11:12; 
Rev. 9:3, 5, 10. The scorpion ranks with the snake as 
hostile to man. 

4. It was said (errethé). First aorist passive indicative 
of eipon. That they should not hurt (hina mé adikésousin). 
Sub-final (object clause subject of erreth2) with hina mé and 
the future active of adiked as in 3:9; 8:3. Vegetation had 
been hurt sufficiently by the hail (8:7). But only such men 
as (ei mé tous anthropous hoitines). “‘Except (elliptical use 
of ei mé, if not, unless) the men who (the very ones who).” 
For this use of hostis see 1:7; 2:24; 20:4. The seal of God 
upon their foreheads (ten sphragida tou theou epi ton metopon). 
Provided for in 7:3ff. ‘“‘As Israel in Egypt escaped the 
plagues which punished their neighbours, so the new Israel 
is exempted from the attack of the locusts of the Abyss” 
(Swete). 

5. That they should not kill them (hina mé apokteindsin 
autous). Sub-final object clause (subject of edothé) with 
hina mé and the subjunctive of apokteind either present 
(continued action) or aorist (constative, form the same), 
the usual construction with hina. The locusts are charged 
to injure men, but not to kill them. But that they should be 
tormented (all’ hina basanisthésontai). Sub-final clause again - 
with Aina, but this time with the first future passive indica- 
tive (like 3:9; 6:4; 8:3; 13:12) of dasanizd, old verb, to test 
metals (from éasanos, Matt. 4:24) by touchstone, then to 
torture like Matt. 8:29, further in Rev. 11:10; 12:2; 14:10; 
20:10. Five months (ménas pente). Accusative of extent 
of time. The actual locust is born in the spring and dies 
at the end of summer (about five months). Torment (basan- 
ismos). Late word for torture, from dasanizo, in N.T. only 
in Rev. 9:5; 14:11; 18:7, 10, 15. The wound of the scorpion 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 363 


was not usually fatal, though exceedingly painful. When it 
striketh a man (hotan paiséi anthropon). Indefinite tem- 
poral clause with hotan and the first aorist active subjunc- 
tive of paid (Matt. 26:51), old verb, to smite, “whenever 
it smites a man.” 

6. Men (hoi anthropoi). Generic use of the article (men 
as a class). Shall not find it (ou mé heurésousin auton). 
Strong double negative ou mé with the future active indica- 
tive according to Aleph Q, but heurésin (second aorist ac- 
tive subjunctive) according to A P (either construction 
regular). The idea here is found in Job 3:21 and Jer. 8:3. 
“Such a death as they desire, a death which will end their 
sufferings, is impossible; physical death is no remedy for 
the dasanismos of an evil conscience” (Swete). They shall 
desire to die (epithumésousin apothanein). Future active of 
epithumed, a climax to zétésousin (they shall seek), to desire 
vehemently. Paul in Phil. 1:23 shows a preference for death 
if his work is done, in order to be with Christ, a very differ- 
ent feeling from what we have here. Fleeth (pheuget). 
Vivid futuristic present active indicative of pheugd. Even 
death does not come to their relief. 

7. The shapes (ta homoidmata). Old word from homoiod, 
to make like (from homoios, like), likeness, in N.T. only 
here, Rom. 5:14; Phil. 2:7, ‘“‘the likenesses were like” 
(homoia). Homoidma is ‘‘midway between morphé and 
schema” (Lightfoot). Unto horses (hippois). Associative- 
instrumental case, as is the rule with homoios (1:15; 2:18; 
4:6ff.; g:10, 193 11:1; 13:2, 11), but with the accusative in 
1:13; 14:14. So also homoioi chrusdi (like gold) in this 
same verse. Prepared for war (hétoimasmenois eis polemon). 
Perfect passive participle of hetoimazd. This imagery of 
war-horses is like that in Joel 2:4f. “The likeness of a 
locust to a horse, especially to a horse equipped with armour, 
is so striking that the insect is named in German Heupferd 
(hay-horse), and in Italian cavalett a little horse” (Vincent). 


364 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


As it were crowns (hos stephanoi). Not actual crowns, but 
what looked like crowns of gold, as conquerors, as indeed 
they were (4:4; 6:2; 12:1; 14:14). These locusts of the abyss 
have another peculiar feature. 4s men’s faces (hos prosopa 
anthropon). Wuman-looking faces in these demonic locusts 
to give added terror, “suggesting the intelligence and ca- 
pacity of man” (Swete). Vincent actually sees ‘“‘a distinct 
resemblance to the human countenance in the face of the 
locust.” 

8. They had (eichan). Imperfect active, late form as in 
Mark 8:7 in place of the usual eichon. As hair of women 
(hos trichas gunaikon). That is long hair (I Cor. 11:15), 
with no reference to matters of sex at all, for anthropodn just 
before is used, not andron (men as distinct from women). 
Perhaps the antenne of the locust were unusually long. 
As the teeth of lions (his leontén). Supply hoi odontes (the 
teeth) before /eontén. See Joel 1:6. The locust is voracious. 

g. As it were breastplates of iron (hos thorakas siderous). 
The thorax was originally the breast (from the neck to the 
navel), then the breastplate, only N.T. usage (Rev. 9:9, 17; 
I Thess. 5:8; Eph. 6:14). The armour for the breastplate 
was usually of iron (siderous, Rev. 2:27), but with the locusts 
it only seemed to be so (40s). However, the scaly backs and 
flanks of the locusts do resemble coats of mail. ‘‘The 
locusts of the Abyss may be the memories of the past 
brought home at times of Divine visitation” (Swete). The . 
sound of their wings (hé phoné ton pterugon). Graphic picture 
of the onrush of the swarms of demonic locusts and the 
hopelessness of resisting them. 4s the sound of chariots, of 
many horses rushing to war (hos phoné harmaton hippon pollon 
trechonton eis polemon). Both metaphors here, the clatter 
and clangour of the chariot wheels and the prancing of the 
horses are found in Joel 2:4f. Trechonton is present active 
predicate participle of trechd, torun. Cf. II Kings 7:6; Jer. 


4733- 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 365 


10. Tails (ouras). Old word, in N.T. only in Rev. 9:10, 
19; 12:4. Like unto scorpions (homoias skorpiois). Aleph A 
wrongly have homoiois (agreeing with skorpiois instead of 
with ouras). It is a condensed idiom for “like unto the 
tails of the scorpions” as we have it in 13:11 (cf. Matt. 5:20; 
I John 2:2). Stings (kentra). Old word from kentred (to 
prick, to sting), in N.T. only here, Acts 26:14 (about Paul); 
I Cor. 15:55 (about death). It is used “of the spur of a 
cock, the quill of the porcupine, and the stings of insects” 
(Vincent). It was the goad used for oxen (Prov. 26:3; Acts 
26:14). In their tails (en tais ourais autin). ‘This locates 
“their power to hurt” (Aé exousia auton adikésai, infinitive — 
here, hina adikésousin in 9:4) in their tails. It might have 
been in other organs. 

11. As king (basilea). Predicate accusative and anar- 
throus. In Prov. 30:27 it is stated that the locust has no 
king, but this is not true of these demonic locusts. Their 
king is “the angel of the abyss (verse 1) whose orders they 
obey.” His name is (onoma autoi). “Name to him” (nomi- 
native absolute and dative, asin 6:8). In Hebrew (Ebraisti). 
Adverb'as in 16:16; John 5:2; 19:13, 17, 20; 20:16. Abaddon. 
A word almost confined to the Wisdom books (Job 26:6; 
Ps. 88:11; Prov. 15:11). It is rendered in the LXX by 
Apdleia, destruction. In the Greek tongue (en tet Hellénikéi). 
With glosséi or dialektdi understood. As usual, John gives 
both the Hebrew and the Greek. pollyon (Apolluén). 
Present active masculine singular participle of apolluo, mean- 
ing “destroying,” used here as a name and so “Destroyer,” 
with the nominative case retained though in apposition with 
the accusative onoma. ‘The personification of Abaddon 
occurs in the Talmud also. It is not clear whether by Apol- 
lyon John means Death or Satan. Bousset even finds in 
the name Apollyon an indirect allusion to Apollo, one of 
whose symbols was the locust, a doubtful point assuredly. 

12. The first woe (hé ouai hé mia). Note feminine gender 


366 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


ascribed to the interjection ouai as in 11:14, perhaps because 
thlipsis is feminine, though we really do not know. Note 
also the ordinal use of mia (one) like proté (first) as in 6:1; 
Mark 16:2. There come yet two Woes (erchetai eti duo Ouat). 
Singular number erchetai instead of erchontai, though duo 
ouai. Itis true that ouai is an interjection and indeclinable, 
but it is here used with duo and is feminine just before, and 
not neuter. 

13. 4 voice (phonén mian). For mian as indefinite article 
see 8:13. Accusative case here after ekousa, though genitive 
in 8:13, a distinction between sound and sense sometimes 
exists (Acts 9:7; 22:9), but not here as the words are clearly 
heard in both instances. From (ek). “Out of the horns.” 
Note triple use of the genitive article here as of the accusa- 
tive article with this identical phrase in 8:3 (“the altar the 
golden the one before the throne’’). 

14. One saying to the sixth angel (legonta toi hektoi). Ac- 
cusative masculine singular active participle of /egd, per- 
sonifying phonén and agreeing with it in case, though not in 
gender. This voice speaks to the sixth angel (dative case). 
Which had the trumpet (ho echon tén salpigga). Nominative 
case in apposition with agge/di (dative), the same anomalous 
phenomenon in 2:20; 3:12; 14:12. Swete treats it as a paren- 
thesis, like 4:1; 11:15. Loose (/uson). First aorist (ingres- 
Sive) active imperative of /ud, “let loose.” Another group 
of four angels (7:1) like Acts 12:4, described here ‘“‘which . 
are bound” (tous dedemenous). Perfect passive articular 
participle of ded, evidently the leaders of the demonic horse- 
men (9:1 5ff.) as the four angels let loose the demonic locusts 
(7:1ff.), both quaternions agents of God’s wrath. ft the 
great river Euphrates (epi toi potamdi toi megaloi Euphrateéi). 
A regular epithet of the Euphrates (16:12; Gen. 15:18; Deut. 
1:7). It rises in Armenia and joins the Tigris in lower 
Babylonia, a total length of nearly 1800 miles, the eastern 
boundary of the Roman Empire next to Parthia. 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 367 


15. Were loosed (eluthésan). First aorist (ingressive) pas- 
sive indicative of /ud, “‘were let loose.” Which had been 
prepared (hoi hétoimasmenoi). Perfect passive articular par- 
ticiple of hetoimazd, to make ready (hetoimos), in a state of 
readiness prepared by God (12:6; 16:12; Matt. 25:34). For 
the hour and day and month and year (eis tén horan kat 
hémeran kai ména kai eniauton). For this use of eis with 
hétoimasmenon see II Tim. 2:21. All preparation over, the 
angels are waiting for the signal to begin. That they should 
kill (hina apokteinosin). ‘The same idiom in verse § about 
the fifth trumpet, which brought torture. This one brings 
death. | 

16. Of the horsemen (tou hippikou). Old adjective hippikos 
from hippos (horse), equestrian. The neuter articular singu- 
lar to hippikon, the horse or the cavalry in contrast with fo 
pezikon (the infantry), here only in N.T. For the numbers 
here see on §:11; 7:4. 

17. And thus I saw in the vision (kai houtos eidon en tet 
horasei). Nowhere else does John allude to his own vision, 
though often in Dan. (7:2; 8:2, 153; 9:21). Having (echontas). 
Accusative masculine plural of echd, probably referring to 
the riders (tous kath@menous ep auton) rather than to the 
horses (tous hippous). Breastplates as of fire and of hyacinth 
and of brimstone (thorakas purinous kai huakinthinous kat 
theiddeis). There is no Ads (as) in the Greek, but that is 
the idea of these three adjectives which are only metaphors. 
Purinos is an old adjective (from pur, fire), here only in 
N.T. Huakinthos is also an old word (from huakinthos, 
hyacinth, then of a sapphire stone Rev. 21:20), of a red 
color bordering on black, here only in the N.T. Theiddes 
is a late word (from theion, brimstone), sulphurous, here 
only in N.T. As the heads of lions (hos kephalai leonton). 
This of the horses, war-horses as always in the Bible except 
in Is. 28:28. These horses likewise have “fire and smoke 
and brimstone”’ (¢heion, brimstone, is old word, in N.T. only 


368 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


in Rev. and Luke 17:29) proceeding (ekporeuetai, singular 
because it comes first and the subjects afterwards) out of 
their mouths. Both rider and horse are terrible. 

18. By these three plagues (apo ton tridn plégon touton). 
Our “plague” or stroke from p/éssd, as in Luke 10:30 and 
often in Rev. (9:20; 11:6; 15:1, 6, 8; 16:9; 18:4, 8; 22:18). 
It is used in Ex. 11:1ff. for the plagues in Egypt. The 
three plagues here are the fire, smoke, and brimstone which 
proceed from the mouths of the horses. Was killed (apek- 
tanthésan). First aorist passive indicative of apokteind, to 
kill, third person plural, though /o friton is neuter singular 
because a collective idea. See same form in verse 20. 

19. The power (hé exousia). As in 2:26; 6:8. This power 
of the horses is both in their mouths (because of the fire, 
smoke, brimstone) and in their tails, “for their tails are 
like unto serpents” (hai gar ourai auton homoiai ophesin). 
Associative-instrumental case ophesin after homoiai. Ophis 
is old word for snake (Matt. 7:10). Having heads (echousai 
kephalas). Feminine present active participle of echd, agree- 
ing with ourai (tails). With them (en autais). Instrumental 
use of en. Surely dreadful monsters. 

20. Repented not (ou metenoésan). First aorist active in- 
dicative of metanoed. The two-thirds of mankind still spared 
did not change their creed or their conduct. Of the works 
(ek ton ergon). For this use of ek after metanoed see 2:21; 
9:21; 16:11. By “works” (ergom) here idolatries are meant, . 
as the next verse shows. _ That they should not worship (hina 
mé proskunésousin). Negative purpose clause with hina mé 
and the future active of proskuned as in 9:5. Devils (ta 
daimonia). Both in the O.T. (Deut. 32:17; Ps. 96:5; 106:37) 
and in the N.T. (I Cor. 10:21) the worship of idols is called 
the worship of unclean spirits. Perhaps this is one explana- 
tion of the hideous faces given these images. ‘‘The idols” 
(ta eidola I John §:21, from eidos, form, appearance) repre- 
sented “demons,” whether made of gold (ta chrusa) or of 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 369 


silver (ta argura) or of brass (ta chalkd) or of stone (ta 
lithina) or of wood (ta xulina). See Dan. 5:23 for this pic- 
ture of heathen idols. The helplessness of these idols, 
“which can neither see nor hear nor walk” (ha oute blepein 
dunantai oute akouein oute peripatein), is often presented in 
the OFF. (Peshrgstofts: 1.15 :4). 

21. Of their murders (ek ton phonon auton). Heads the 
list, but “sorceries” (ek ton pharmakon) comes next. Phar- 
makon was originally enchantment, as also in Rev. 21:8, 
then drug. For pharmakia see Rev. 18:34; Gal. 5:20. The 
two other items are fornication (porneias) and thefts (klem- 
maton, old word from kleptd, here alone in N.T.), all four . 
characteristic of demonic worship and idolatry. See other 
lists of vices in Mark 7:21; Gal. 5:20; Rev. 21:8; 22:15. 
Our word “pharmacy” as applied to drugs and medicine 
has certainly come a long way out of a bad environment, 
but there is still a bad odour about “‘patent medicines.” 


CHAPTER*®X 


1. Another strong angel (allon aggelon ischuron). But the 
seventh trumpet does not sound till 11:15. This angel is 
not one of the seven or of the four, but like the other strong 
angel in 5:2 and 18:21 or the other angel in 14:6, 15. The 
sixth trumpet of 9:13 ends in 9:21. The opening of the 
seventh seal was preceded by two visions (chapter 7) and 
so here the sounding of the seventh trumpet (11:15) is pre- 
ceded by a new series of visions (10:1 to 11:14). Coming 
down out of heaven (katabainonta ek tou ouranou). Present 
active participle of katabaind picturing the process of the 
descent as in 20:1 (cf. 3:12). Arrayed with a cloud (peri- 
beblemenon nephelen). Perfect passive participle of periballo 
with accusative case retained as in 7:9, 13. Not proof that 
this angel is Christ, though Christ will come on the clouds 
(1:7) as he ascended on a cloud (Acts 1:9). God’s chariot 
is in the clouds (Ps. 104:3), but this angel is a special mes- 
senger of God’s. The rainbow (hé iris). See 4:3 for this 
word. The construction here is changed from the accusa- 
tive to the nominative. 4s the sun (hos ho hélios). The 
very metaphor applied to Christ in 1:16. 4s pillars of fire 
(hos stuloi puros). Somewhat like the metaphor of Christ: 
in 1:15, but still no proof that this angel is Christ. On 
stulos see 3:12 and Gal. 2:9. 

2. And he had (kai echon). This use of the participle 
in place of eichen (imperfect) is like that in 4:7f.; 12:25 
1g:12; 21:12, 14, a Semitic idiom (Charles), or as if kata- 
bainon (nominative) had preceded in place of katabainonta. 
A little book (biblaridion). A diminutive of diblarion (papyri), 
itself a diminutive of Jiblion (5:1) and perhaps in contrast 
with it, a rare form in Hermas and Rev. 10:2, g, 10. In 


37s 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN aan 


10:8 Tischendorf reads diblidarion, diminutive of diblidion 
(Aristophanes) instead of did/ion (Westcott and Hort). The 
contents of this little book-are found in 11:1-13. Open 
(énedigmenon). See Ezek. 2:9f. Perfect (triple reduplica- 
tion) passive participle of anoigd, in contrast to the closed 
book in 5:1. There also we have epi (upon) tén dexian (the 
right hand), for it was a large roll, but here the little open 
roll is held in the hand (em té cheiri), apparently the left 
hand (verse 5). He set (eth@ken). First aorist active indica- 
tive of tithémi. The size of the angel is colossal, for he be- 
strides both land and sea. Apparently there is no special 
point in the right foot (ton poda ton dexion) being on the - 
sea (epi tés thalassés) and the left (ton eudnumon) upon the 
land (epi tes gés). It makes a bold and graphic picture. 
As a lion roareth (hosper lein mukdatai). Only instance of 
hosper in the Apocalypse, but Ads in the same sense several 
times. Present middle indicative of mukaomai, an old 
onomatopoetic word from mu or moo (the sound which a 
cow utters), common for the lowing and bellowing of cattle, 
Latin mugire, but in Theocritus for the roaring of a lion 
as here, though in I Pet. 5:3 we have druomai. Homer uses 
mukaomai for the clangour of the shield and Aristophanes 
for thunder. It occurs here alone in the N.T. It does not 
mean that what the angel said was unintelligible, only loud. 
Bi WUOs 6 223, 3Rsby1057732,-10, etc. 

3. The seven thunders (hai hepta brontai). A recognized 
group, but not explained here, perhaps John assuming them 
to be known. For drontai see already 4:5; 6:1; 8:5. In Ps. 
29 the Lord speaks in the sevenfold voice of the thunder- 
storm upon the sea. Their voices (tas heauton phonas). 
Cognate accusative with e/alésan and heauton (reflexive) 
means “‘their own.” In John 12:28 the voice of the Father 
to Christ was thought by some to be thunder. 

4. I was about to write (émellon graphein). Imperfect ac- 


372 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


tive of mello (double augment as in John 4:47; 12:33; 18:32) 
and the present (inchoative) active infinitive of grapho, “I 
was on the point of beginning to write,” as commanded in 
I:11, 19. Seal up (sphragison). Aorist active imperative 
of sphragizd, tense of urgency, “seal up at once.” And 
write them not (kai mé auta grapséis). Prohibition with mé 
and the ingressive aorist active subjunctive of graphd, ‘Do 
not begin to write.” It is idle to conjecture what was in 
the utterances. Compare Paul’s silence in II Cor. 12:4. 

5. Standing (hestota). Second perfect active participle of 
hist@mi (intransitive). John resumes the picture in verse 2. 
Lifted up (éren). First aorist active indicative of aird, to 
lift up. To heaven (eis ton ouranon). Toward heaven, the 
customary gesture in taking a solemn oath (Gen. 14:22; 
Deut. 32:40; Dan. 12:7). 

6. Sware (Gmosen). First aorist indicative of omnud to 
swear. By him that liveth (en toi zonti). This use of en 
after omnuo instead of the usual accusative (James 5:12) is 
like the Hebrew (Matt. 5:34, 36). ‘“The living one for ages 
of ages” is a common phrase in the Apocalypse for God as 
eternally existing (1:18; 4:9, 10; 15:7). This oath proves 
that this angel is not Christ. Who created (hos ektisen). 
First aorist active indicative of ktizd, a reference to God’s 
creative activity as seen in Gen. 1:1ff.; Ex. 20:11; Is. 37:16; 
42:5; Ps. 33:6; 145:6, etc. That there shall be time no longer . 
(Aoti chronos ouketi estai). Future indicative indirect dis- 
course with oti. But’ this does not mean that chronos 
(time), Einstein’s “fourth dimension” (added to length, 
breadth, height), will cease to exist, but only that there 
will be no more delay in the fulfillment of the seventh 
trumpet (verse 7), in answer to the question, “How long?” 
(6:10). 

7. When he is about to sound (hotan melléi salpizein). In- 
definite temporal clause with hotan and the present active 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 373 


subjunctive of me//é and the present (inchoative) active in- 
finitive of sa/pizd, “whenever he is about to begin to sound” 
(in contrast to the aorist in 11:15). Then (kai). So in 
apodosis often (14:10). Js finished (etelesthé). First aorist 
passive indicative of. ¢e/ed, proleptic or futuristic use of the 
aorist as in I Cor. 7:28. So also 15:1. The mystery of God 
(to mustérion tou theou). This same phrase by Paul in I 
Cor. 2:1; Col. 2:2. Here apparently the whole purpose of 
God in human history is meant. According to the good tidings 
which he declared (hos euéggelisen). ‘“As he gospelized to,” 
first aorist active indicative of euaggelizd, a rare use of the 
active as in 14:6 with the accusative. See the middle so- 
used) iniGalisn:g7 [Petzerz122id See Amosay273\ Jerni7:253 
25:4 for this idea in the O.T. prophets who hoped for a 
cleaning up of all mysteries in the last days. 

8. Again speaking and saying (palin lalousan kai legousan). 
Present active predicate participles feminine accusative sin- 
gular agreeing with Aén (object of ékousa), not with phoné 
(nominative) as most of the cursives have it (/alousa kai 
legousa). Ordinarily it would be elalei kai elegen. See 4:1 
for like idiom. This is the voice mentioned in verse 4. No 
great distinction is to be made here between /a/ed and Jegé. 
Go, take (Hupage labe). Present active imperative of hupago 
and second aorist active imperative of Jamband. The use 
of hupage (exclamation like ide) is common in N.T. (Matt. 
5:24; 8:4; 19:21; John 4:16; 9:7). Charles calls it a He-: 
braism (16:1). Note the repeated article here (¢o) referring 
to the open book in the hand of the angel (verse 2), only 
here diblion is used, not the diminutive of Jiblaridion of 
verses 2, 9, I0. 

g. I went (apéltha). Second aorist active indicative (-a 
form), “I went away” (ap-) to the angel. John left his 
position by the door of heaven (4:1). That he should give 
(dounai). Second aorist active infinitive of didomi, indirect 


374 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


command after /egon (bidding) for dos in the direct discourse 
(second aorist active imperative second person singular). 
This use of /egd to bid occurs in 13:14; Acts 21:21. He saith 
(Jegei). Dramatic vivid present active indicative of J/egé. 
Take it and eat it up (labe kai kataphage auto). Second aorist 
(effective) active imperatives of Jambané and katesthio (per- 
fective use of kata, “‘eat down,” we say “eat up”). See the 
same metaphor in Ezek. 3:1-3; Jer. 15:6f. The book was 
already open and was not to be read aloud, but to be digested 
mentally by John. I¢ shall make thy belly bitter (pikranei 
sou ten koilian). Future active of pikraind, for which verb 
see 8:11; 10:10; and Col. 3:19. There is no reference in 
Ezekiel or Jeremiah to the bitterness here mentioned. Sweet 
as honey (gluku hos meli). Yor the sweetness of the roll see 
Ps. 19:10f.; 119:103. “‘Every revelation of God’s purposes, 
even though a mere fragment, a did/aridion, is ‘bitter-sweet,’ 
disclosing judgement as well as mercy” (Swete). Deep and 
bitter sorrows confront John as he comes to understand 
God’s will and way. 

10. [ took—and ate it up (elabon—kai katephagon auto). 
Second aorist active indicatives of the same verbs to show 
John’s prompt obedience to the command. The order of the 
results is here changed to the actual experience (sweet in the 
mouth, bitter in the belly). The simplex verb ephagon 
(I ate) is now used, not the compound katephagon (I ate up). | 

11. They say (legousin). Present active of vivid dramatic 
action and the indefinite statement in the plural as in 13:16; 
16:15. It is possible that the allusion is to the heavenly 
voice (10:4, 8) and to the angel (10:9): Thou must prophesy 
again (det se palin propheteusai). Not a new commission 
(1:19), though now renewed. Cf. Ezek. 4:7; 6:2; Jer. 1:10. 
The palin (again) points to what has preceded and also to 
what is to come in 11:15. Here it is predictive prophecy 
(prophéteusai, first aorist active infinitive of prophéteud). 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 375 


Over (epi). In the case, in regard to as in John 12:16 (with 
grapho), not in the presence of (epi with genitive, Mark 13:9) 
nor against (epi with the accusative, Luke 22:53). For 
this list of peoples see 5:9, occurring seven times in the 
Apocalypse. 


CHAPTER XI 


1. A reed (kalamos). Old word for a growing reed (Matt. 
11:7) which grew in immense brakes in the Jordan valley, a 
writer’s reed (III John 7), a measuring-rod (here, 21:15f.5 
Ezek. 40:3-6; 42:16-19). Like a rod (homoios rabdoi). See 
2:27; Mark 6:8 for rabdos. And one said (legon). “Saying” 
(present active masculine participle of /ego) is all that the 
Greek has. The participle implies edoken (he gave), not 
edothé, a harsh construction seen in Gen. 22:20; 38:24, etc. 
Rise and measure (egeire kai metréson). Present active im- 
perative of egeird (intransitive, exclamatory use as in Mark 
2:11) and first aorist active imperative of metred. In Ezek. 
42:2ff. the prophet measures the temple and that passage is 
probably in mind here. But modern scholars do not know 
how to interpret this interlude (11:1-13) before the seventh 
trumpet (11:15). Some (Wellhausen) take it to be a scrap 
from the Zealot party before the destruction of Jerusalem, 
which event Christ also foretold (Mark 13:2 =Matt. 24:2 = 
Luke 21:6) and which was also attributed to Stephen (Acts 
6:14). Charles denies any possible literal interpretation and 
takes the language in a wholly eschatological sense. There . 
are three points in the interlude, however understood: the 
chastisement of Jerusalem or Israel (verses 1 and 2), the 
mission of the two witnesses (3-12), the rescue of the rem- 
nant (13). There is a heavenly sanctuary (7:15; 11:19; 
14:15, etc.), but here aos is on earth and yet not the actual 
temple in Jerusalem (unless so interpreted). Perhaps here 
it is the spiritual (3:12; IT Thess. 2:4; I Cor. 3:16f.; II Cor. 
6:16; Eph. 2:19ff.). For altar (thusiastérion) see 8:3. Per- 
haps measuring as applied to “‘them that worship therein” 

376 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 377; 


(tous proskunountas en autodi) implies a word like numbering, 
with an allusion to the 144,000 in chapter 7 (a zeugma). 

2. The court (tén aulen). The uncovered yard outside the 
house. There were usually two, one between the door and 
the street, the outer court, the other the inner court sur- 
rounded by the buildings (Mark 14:66). This is here the 
outer court, “which is without the temple” (té7 exdthen tou 
naou), outside of the sanctuary, but within the Aieron where 
the Gentiles could go (carrying out the imagery of the 
Jerusalem temple). Leave without (ekbale exithen). Liter- 
ally, “‘cast without” (second aorist active imperative of 
ekballo. Do not measure it (mé autéen metréséis). Prohibition © 
with mé and the first aorist active (ingressive) subjunctive 
of metred. This outer court is left to its fate. In Herod’s 
temple the outer court was marked off from the inner by 
“the middle wall of partition” (to mesoitoichon tou phragmou, 
Eph. 2:15), beyond which a Gentile could not go. In this 
outer court was a house of prayer for the Gentiles (Mark 
11:17), but now John is to cast it out and leave to its fate 
(given to the Gentiles in another sense) to be profaned by 
them. They shall tread under foot (patésousin). Future 
active of pated, here to trample with contempt as in Luke 
21:24, even the holy city (Matt. 4:5; Is. 48:2; Neh. 11:1). 
Charles thinks that only the heavenly city can be so called 
here (21:2, 10; 22:19) because of 11:8 (Sodom and Gomor- 
rah). But the language may be merely symbolical. See 
Dan. 9:24. Forty and two months (ménas tesserakonta kai 
duo). Accusative of extent of time. This period in Dan. 
7:25; 12:7. It occurs in three forms in the Apocalypse 
(forty-two months, here and 13:5; 1260 days, 11:3 and 12:6; 
time, times and half a time or 34 years, 12:14 and so in 
Daniel). This period, however its length may be con- 
strued, covers the duration of the triumph of the Gentiles, 
of the prophesying of the two witnesses, of the sojourn of the 
woman in the wilderness. 


378 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


3. I will give (doéso). Future active of didimi. The 
speaker may be God (Beckwith) or Christ (Swete) as in 
2:13; 21:6 or his angel representative (22:7, 12ff.). The 
idiom that follows is Hebraic instead of either the infinitive 
after didomi as in 2:73 3:21; 6:4; 7:23 13:7, 15; 16:8 or hina 
with the subjunctive (9:5; 19:8) we have kai prophéteu- 
sousin (and they shall prophesy). Unto my two witnesses 
(tois dusin martusin mou). Dative case after doso. The 
article seems to point to two well-known characters, like 
Elijah, Elisha, but there is no possible way to determine 
who they are. All sorts of identifications have been at- 
tempted. Clothed (periblemenous). Perfect passive par- 
ticiple of periballd as often before (7:9, 13; 10:1, etc.). But 
Aleph A P Q here read the accusative plural in -ous, while 
C has the nominative in -oi. Charles suggests a mere slip 
for the nominative, but Hort suggests a primitive error in 
early MSS. for the dative peribeblemenois agreeing with 
martusin. In sackcloth (sakkous). Accusative retained with 
this passive verb as in 7:9, 13. See 6:12 for sakkos and also 
Matt. 3:4. The dress suited the message (Matt. 11:21). 

4. The two olive trees (hai duo elaiai). The article seems 
to point to what is known. For this original use of elaia 
see Rom. 11:17, 24. In Zech. 4:2, 3, 14 the lampstand or 
candlestick (/uchnia) is Israel, and the two olive trees ap- 
parently Joshua and Zerubbabel, but John makes his own 
use of this symbolism. Here the two olive trees and the © 
candlesticks are identical. Standing (hestotes). Masculine 
perfect active participle agreeing with Aoufoi instead of 
hestosai (read by P and cursives) agreeing with elaiai kai 
luchniai, even though hai (feminine plural article) be ac- 
cepted before endpion tou kuriou (before the Lord). 

5. If any man desireth to hurt them (ei tis autous thelei 
note Condition of first class, assumed to be true, with 
ei and present active indicative (¢helei) “if any one wants to 
hurt” (adikésai first aorist active infinitive). It is impos- 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 379 


sible to hurt these two witnesses till they do their work. 
The fire proceeding out of the mouths of the witnesses is 
like Elijah’s experience (II Kings 1:10). Devoureth (kates- 
thiei). “Eats up (down),” present active indicative of 
katesthio. If any man shall desire (ei tis theléséi). Condi- 
tion of third class with ei and first aorist active subjunctive 
of theld as in Luke 9:13; Phil. 3:12, but MSS. also read 
either thelei (present active indicative) or thelései (future ac- 
tive, condition of the first class like the preceding one. The 
condition is repeated in this changed form, as less likely to 
happen and with inevitable death (dei auton apoktanthénai, 
must be killed, first aorist passive infinitive of apokteind 
with dei). 

6. To shut the heaven (kleisai ton ouranon). First aorist 
active infinitive of k/eid. As Elijah did by prayer (I Kings 
17:1; Luke 4:25; James 5:17). That it rain not (hina mé 
huetos brechéi). Sub-final use of hina mé with the present 
active subjunctive of drechd, old verb to rain (Matt. 5:45), 
here with huetos as subject. During the days (tas hémeras). 
Accusative of extent of time. In Luke 4:25 and James 5:17 
the period of the drouth in Elijah’s time was three and a 
half years, just the period here. Of their prophecy (¢és 
prophéteias auton). Not here the gift of prophecy (I Cor. 
12:10) or a particular prophecy or collection of prophecies 
(Rev. 1:3; 22:7f.), but “the execution of the prophetic 
office’”’ (Swete). Over the waters (epi ton hudaton). “Upon 
the waters.” As Moses had (Ex. 7:20). Into blood (eis 
haima). As already stated in 8:8 about the third trumpet 
and now again here. To smite (pataxai). First aorist ac- 
tive infinitive of patassd, used here with exousian echousin 
(they have power), as is strephein (to turn). With every 
plague (en paséi plégei). In I Kings 4:8, but with reference 
to the plagues in Egypt. 4s often as they shall desire (hosakis 
ean thelésosin). Indefinite temporal clause with hosakis and 


380 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


modal ean (=an) and the first aorist active subjunctive of 
theld, ‘‘as often as they will.” 

7. When they shall have finished (hotan telesosin). Merely 
the first aorist active subjunctive of teled with hotan in an 
indefinite temporal clause with no futurum exactum (future 
perfect), “whenever they finish.” The beast (to thérion). 
“The wild beast comes out of the abyss” of g:1f. He re- 
appears in 13:1; 17:8. In Dan. 7:3 théria occurs. Nothing 
less than antichrist will satisfy the picture here. Some see 
the abomination of Dan. 7:7 and Matt. 24:15. Some see 
Nero redivivus. He shall make war with them (poiései met’ 
auton polemon). ‘This same phrase occurs in 12:17 about 
the dragon’s attack on the woman. It is more the picture 
of single combat (2:16). He shall overcome them (nikései 
autous). Future active of nikad. The victory of the beast 
over the two witnesses is certain, asin Dan. 7:21. And kill 
them (kai apoktenei). Future active of apokteind. Without 
attempting to apply this prophecy to specific individuals or 
times, one can agree with these words of Swete: ‘“‘But his 
words cover in effect all the martyrdoms and massacres of 
history in which brute force has seemed to triumph over 
truth and righteousness.” 

8. Their dead bodies lie (to pt0ma auton). Old word from 
pipto (to fall), a fall, especially of bodies slain in battle, a 
corpse, a carcase (Matt. 14:12), here the singular (some 
MSS. ptomata, plural) as belonging to each of the auton - 
(their) like stomatos auton (their mouth) in verse 5. So also 
in verse 9. No word in the Greek for “lie.” In (epi). 
“Upon,” as in verse 6, with genitive (¢@s plateias), the broad 
way (hodou understood), from platus (broad) as in Matt. 
6:5, old word (Rev. 21:21; 22:2). Of the great city (tés 
poleds tés megalés). Clearly Jerusalem in view of the closing 
clause (hopou—estaurothé), though not here called “the holy 
city”’ as in verse 2, and though elsewhere in the Apocalypse 
Babylon (Rome) is so described (14:8; 16:19; 17:5; 18:2, 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 381 


10, 16, 18, 19, 21). Which (hétis). “Which very city,” not 
“whichever.” Spiritually (pneumatikos). This late adverb 
from pneumatikos (spiritual)-occurs in the N.T. only twice, 
in I Cor. 2:14 (13) for the help of the Holy Spirit -in in- 
terpreting God’s message and here in a hidden or mystical 
(allegorical sense). For this use of pneumatikos see 1 Cor. 
10:3f. Judah is called Sodom in Is. 1:9f.; Ezek. TOG EE: 
See also Matt. 10:15; 11:23. Egypt is not applied to Israel 
in the O.T., but is “an obvious symbol of oppression and 
slavery” (Swete). Where also their Lord was crucified (hopou 
kai ho kurios auton estauroth@). First aorist passive indica- 
tive of staurod, to crucify, a reference to the fact of Christ’s - 
crucifixion in Jerusalem. This item is one of the sins of 
Jerusalem and the disciple is not greater than the Master 
(John 15:20). 

9. Men from among (ek ton etc.). No word for “men” 
(anthropoi or polloi) before ek ton, but it is implied (partitive 
use of ek) as in 2:10 and often. See also 5:9; 7:9 for this 
enumeration of races and nations. Do look upon (blepousin). 
Present (vivid dramatic) active indicative of blepd. Three 
days and a half (hémeras treis kai hemisu). Accusative of 
extent of time. Hémisu is neuter singular though hémeras 
(days) is feminine as in Mark 6:23; Rev. 12:14. The days 
of the gloating over the dead bodies are as many as the 
years of the prophesying by the witnesses (11:3), but there 
is no necessary correspondence (day for a year). This de- 
light of the spectators “‘is represented as at once fiendish 
and childish” (Swete). Suffer not (ouk aphiousin). Present 
active indicative of aphid, late form for aphiémi, as in 
Mark 1:34 (cf. apheis in Rev. 2:20). This use of aphiemi 
with the infinitive is here alone in the Apocalypse, though 
common elsewhere (John 11:44, 48; 12:7; 18:8). Their dead 
bodies (ta ptomata auton). “Their corpses,” plural here, 
though singular just before and in verse 8. To be laid in a 
tomb (tethénai eis mnéma). First aorist passive of stithémi, 


382 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


to place. Mnéma (old word from mimnésko, to remind) is 
a memorial, a monument, a sepulchre, a tomb (Mark 5:3). 
“Tn a country where burial regularly took place on the day 
of death the time of exposure and indignity would be re- 
garded long” (Beckwith). See Tobit 1:18ff. 

10. They that dwell upon the earth (hoi katoikountes epi 
tés gés). Present active articular participle of katoiked, “an 
Apocalyptic formula” (Swete) for the non-Christian world 
(3:10; 6:10; 8:13; 13:8, 12, 14; 17:8). Rejoice (chairousin). 
Present active indicative of chaird. Over them (ep’ autois). 
Locative (or dative) case with epi as in 10:11. Make merry 
(euphrainontai). Present middle indicative of euphraind, 
old verb (eu, phrén, jolly mind), as in Luke 15:32; Rev. 
12:12; 18:20. Jubilant jollification over the cessation of the 
activity of the two prophets. They shall send gifts to one 
another (dora pempsousin allélois). Future active of pempo 
with dative allélois. Just as we see it done in Esther 9:19, 
22; Neh. 8:10, 12. Tormented (ebasanisan). First aorist 
active indicative of basanizd, for which see 9:5. This is 
the reason (Aoti) of the fiendish glee of Jew and Gentile, 
who no longer will have to endure the prophecies (11:3f.) 
and dread miracles (11:5f.) of these two prophets. ‘“‘Such 
a sense of relief is perhaps not seldom felt today by bad 
men when a preacher of righteousness or a signal example 
of goodness is removed” (Swete). 

11. After the (meta tas etc.). The article tas (the) points ~ 
back to 11:9. The breath of life from God (pneuma xoés ek 
tou theou). ‘This phrase (pneuma xz0és) occurs in Gen. 6:17; 
7:15, 22 of the lower animals, but here there is clearly an 
allusion to Ezek. 37:5, 10 (also II Kings 13:21), where the 
dead bones lived again. Entered into them (eisélthen en 
autois). Second aorist active indicative of eiserchomai with 
en rather than eis after it (cf. Luke 9:46). The prophecy 
has here become fact (change from future pempsousin to 
aorist eisélthen). They stood upon their feet (estésau epi tous 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 383 


podas auton). Ingressive second aorist active indicative of 
histémi (intransitive). Reference to Ezek. 37:10, but with 
the accusative in place of genitive there after epi as in II 
Kings 13:21. Fell upon (epepesen epi). Second aorist ac- 
tive indicative of epipiptd with repetition of epi. The same 
prophetic use of the aorist as in eisélthen and estésan. Be- 
held (theorountas). Present active articular participle of 
theored. “The spectators were panic-stricken” (Swete). 

12. Saying (Jegousés). Present active predicate participle 
of /egd, feminine genitive agreeing with phonés, though some 
MSS. have the accusative phdnén legousan, either construc- 
tion being proper after @kousan (they heard). There is a 
little evidence for @kousa like 12:10 (24 times in the book). 
Cf. John 5:28. Come up hither (anabate hide). Second 
aorist active imperative of anabaind. The ascension of these 
two witnesses is in full view of their enemies, not just in 
the presence of a few friends as with Christ (Acts 1:9). 
They went up (anebésan). Second aorist active indicative 
of anabaino. In the cloud (en tei nepheléi). As Jesus did 
(Acts 1:9) and like Elijah (II Kings 2:11). Their triumph 
is openly celebrated before their enemies and is like the 
rapture described by Paul in I Thess. 4:17. 

13. There was (egeneto). ‘““There came to pass” (second 
aorist middle indicative of ginomai). Earthquakes are often 
given as a symbol of great upheavals in social and spiritual 
order (Swete) as in Ezek. 37:7; 38:19; Hagg. 2:6; Mark 
13:8; Heb. 12:26f.; Rev. 6:12; 16:18. Fell (epesen). Second 
aorist active indicative of pipfd, to fall. Only the tenth (¢o 
dekaton) of the city fell. Cf. to triton (the third) in 8:7-12, 
perhaps a conventional number. Were killed (apektanthésan). 
First aorist passive indicative of apokteind as in 9:18. Seven 
thousand persons (onomata anthropon chiliades hepta). ‘This 
use of onomata (names of men here) is like that in 3:4; Acts 
1:15 and occurs in the papyri (Deissmann, Bible Studies, p. 
196f.). Were affrighted (emphoboi egenonto). ‘Became ter- 


384 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


rified,” old adjective (en, phobos, fear) as in Luke 24:5; Acts 
10:43 24:25. “‘A general movement toward Christianity, 
induced by fear or despair—a prediction fulfilled more than 
once in ecclesiastical history” (Swete). Gave glory (edokan 
doxan). First aorist active indicative of didimi, when they 
saw the effect of the earthquake, recognition of God’s power 
(John 9:24; Acts 12:23; Rom. 4:20). 

14. Is past (apélthen). Second aorist active indicative of 
aperchomai. See 9:12 for this use and 21:1, 4. The second 
woe (hé ouai hé deutera) is the sixth trumpet (9:12) with the 
two episodes attached (10:1-11:13). The third woe (hé ouai 
hé trité, feminine as in 9:12) is the seventh trumpet, which 
now “cometh quickly” (erchetai tachu), for which phrase 
see 2:16; 3:11; 22:7, 12,20. Usually pointing to the Parousia. 

15. There followed (egenonto). “There came to pass.” 
There was silence in heaven upon the opening of the seventh 
seal (8:1), but here ‘“‘great voices.” Perhaps the great 
voices are the 20a of 4:6ff.; 5:8. Saying (legontes). Con- 
struction according to sense; /egontes, masculine participle 
(not /egousai), though phdnai, feminine. John understood 
what was said. Is become (egeneto). ‘Did become,” pro- 
phetic use of the aorist participle, already a fact. See 
egeneto in Luke 19:9. The kingdom of our Lord and of his 
Christ (tou kuriou hémon kai tou Christou autou). Repeat 
hé basileia from the preceding. God the Father is meant 
here by kuriou (Lord), as autou (his) shows. This is the . 
certain and glorious outcome of the age-long struggle against 
Satan, who wields the kingdom of the world which he offered 
to Christ on the mountain for one act of worship. But Jesus 
scorned partnership with Satan in the rule of the world, 
and chose war, war up to the hilt and to the end. Now the 
climax has come with Christ as Conqueror of the kingdom 
of this world for his Father. This is the crowning lesson 
of the Apocalypse. He shall reign (basileusei). Future ac- 
tive of basileud. God shall reign, but the rule of God and 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 385 


of Christ is one as the kingdom is one (I Cor. 15:27). Jesus 
is the Lord’s Anointed (Luke 2:26; 9:20). 

16. The four and twenty elders (hoi eikosi tessares pres- 
buteroi). They follow the living creatures (verse 15, if cor- 
rectly interpreted) in their adoration, as in 4:9ff. Though 
seated on thrones of their own (4:4), yet they fall upon their 
faces in every act of worship to God and Christ (4:10; 
5:8, 14; 19:4). Here epi ta prosdpa auton (upon their faces) 
is added as in 7:11 about the angels. The elders here again 
represent the redeemed, as the four living creatures the 
forces of nature, in the great thanksgiving here (eucharis- 
toumen, present active indicative of eucharisted). 

17. O Lord God (Kurie ho theos). Vocative form kurie and 
nominative form ho theos (vocative in use). See 1:8; 4:8 for 
this combination with ho pantokrator (the Almighty). For 
ho 6n kat ho én (which art and which wast) see 1:4, 8; 4:8; 
16:5. Thou hast taken (eiléphes). Perfect active indicative of 
lambano, emphasizing the permanence of God’s rule, “Thou 
hast assumed thy power.” Didst reign (ebasileusas). In- 
gressive first aorist active indicative of basileud, “Didst be- 
gin to reign.” See this combination of tenses (perfect and 
aorist) without confusion in 3:33 5:7; 8:5. 

18. Were wroth (orgisthésan). Ingressive first aorist ac- 
tive indicative of orgizomai, “became angry.” The culmina- 
tion of wrath against God (16:13ff.; 20:8f.). Cf. Ps. 2:1, 5, 
12; 99:1; Acts 4:25ff. John sees the hostility of the world 
against Christ. Thy wrath came (élthen hé orgé sou). Second 
aorist active indicative of erchomai, the prophetic aorist 
again. The Dies Ire is conceived as already come. The 
time of the dead to be judged (ho kairos ton nekron krithénat). 
For this use of kairos see Mark 11:13; Luke 21:24. By “the 
dead” John apparently means both good and bad (John 
5:25; Acts 24:21), coincident with the resurrection and judg- 
ment (Mark 4:29; Rev. 14:15ff.; 20:1-15). The infinitive 
krithénai is the first aorist passive of krind, epexegetic use 


386 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


with the preceding clause, as is true also of dounai (second 
aorist active infinitive of diddmi), to give. Their reward (ton 
misthon). This will come in the end of the day (Matt. 20:8), 
from God (Matt. 6:1), at the Lord’s return (Rev. 22:12), 
according to each one’s work (I Cor. 3:8). The small and 
the great (tous mikrous kai tous megalous). The accusative 
here is an anacoluthon and fails to agree in case with the 
‘preceding datives after dounai ton misthon, though some 
MSS. have the dative tois mikrois, etc. John is fond of this 
phrase “the small and the great” (13:16; 19:5, 18; 20:12). 
To destroy (diaphtheirai). First aorist active infinitive of 
diaphtheiro, carrying on the construction with kairos. Note 
tous diaphtheirontas, “those destroying” the earth (cor- 
rupting the earth). There is a double sense in diaphtheird 
that justifies this play on the word. See 19:2. In I Tim. 
6:5 we have those “corrupted in mind” (diaphtharmenoi ton 
noun). God will destroy the destroyers (I Cor. 3:16f.). 

19. Was opened (énoigé). Second aorist passive indicative 
of anoigd, with augment on the preposition as in 15:5. For 
the sanctuary (aos) of God in heaven see 3:12; 7:15; 
15:6ff.; 21:22. Was seen (Ophthé). First aorist passive in- 
dicative of horad. The ark of his covenant (hé kibotos tés 
diathékés autou). The sacred ark within the second veil of 
the tabernacle (Heb. 9:4) and in the inner chamber of Sol- 
omon’s temple (I Kings 8:6) which probably perished when 
Nebuchadrezzar burnt the temple (II Kings 25:9; Jer. 3:16). -

CHAPTER XII 


1. 4 great sign (sémeion mega). The first of the visions 
to be so described (13:3; 15:1), and it is introduced by 
ophthé as in 11:19 and 12:3, not by meta tauto or by eidon 
or by etdon kai idou as heretofore. This “sign” is really a 
teras (wonder), as it is so by association in Matt. 24:24; 
John 4:48; Acts 2:22; 5:12. The element of wonder is not 
in the word sémeion as in teras, but often in the thing itself ~ 
as in Luke 21:11; John 9:16; Rev. 13:13ff.; 1521: ¥rotig: 
19:20. 4 woman (guné). Nominative case in apposition 
with sémeion. “The first ‘sign in heaven’ is a Woman—the 
earliest appearance of a female figure in the Apocalyptic 
vision” (Swete). Arrayed with the sun (peribeblémené ton 
hélion). Perfect passive participle of periballd, with the 
accusative retained as so often (9 times) in the Apocalypse. 
Both Charles and Moffatt see mythological ideas and sources 
behind the bold imagery here that leave us all at sea. Swete 
understands the Woman to be “‘the church of the Old Testa- 
ment” as “the Mother of whom Christ came after the flesh. 
But here, as everywhere in the Book, no sharp dividing line 
is drawn between the Church of the Old Testament and the 
Christian Society.” Certainly she is not the Virgin Mary, 
as verse 17 makes clear. Beckwith takes her to be “‘the 
heavenly representative of the people of God, the ideal Zion, 
which, so far as it is embodied in concrete realities, is repre- 
sented alike by the people of the Old and the New Cove- 
nants.” John may have in mind Is. 7:14 (Matt. 1:23; 
Luke 1:31) as well as Mic. 4:10; Is. 26:17f.; 66:7 without a 
definite picture of Mary. The metaphor of childbirth is 
common enough (John 16:21; Gal. 4:19). The figure is a 
bold one with the moon “under her feet” (hupokatd tin 

387 


388 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


podoin autés) and “‘a crown of twelve stars” (stephanos 
asteron dodeka), a possible allusion to the twelve tribes 
(James 1:1; Rev. 21:12) or to the twelve apostles (Rev. 
21:14). 

2. And she was with child (kai en gastri echousa). Perhaps 
estin to be supplied or the participle used as a finite verb 
as in 10:2. This is the technical idiom for pregnancy as in 
Matt. 1:18, 23, etc. Travailing in birth (Odinousa). Present 
active participle of ddind, old verb (from odin birth-pangs 
I Thess. 5:3), in N.T. only here and Gal. 4:27. And in pain 
(kat basanizomené). “And tormented” (present passive par- 
ticiple of dasanizo, for which see already 9:5; 11:10), only 
here in N.T. in sense of childbirth. To be delivered (tekein). 
Second aorist active infinitive of tiktd, to give birth, epexe- 
getical use. Also in verse 4. 

3- Another sign (allo semeion). “A second tableau fol- 
lowing close upon the first and inseparable from it” (Swete). 
And behold (kai idou). As often (4:1; 6:2, 5, 8, etc.). 4 
great red dragon (drakon megas purros). Homer uses this 
old word (probably from derkomai, to see clearly) for a great 
monster with three heads coiled like a serpent that ate 
poisonous herbs. The word occurs also in Hesiod, Pindar, 
#Eschylus. The Babylonians feared a seven-headed hydra 
and Typhon was the Egyptian dragon who persecuted 
Osiris. One wonders if these and the Chinese dragons are 
not race memories of conflicts with the diplodocus and like - 
monsters before their disappearance. Charles notes in the 
O.T. this monster as the chief enemy of God under such title 
as Rahab (Is. §1:9f.; Job 26:12f.), Behemoth (Job 40:1 5-24), 
Leviathan (Is. 27:1), the Serpent (Amos graff ones 
74:13 we read of “the heads of the dragons.’ On purros 
(red) see 6:4. Here (12:9) and in 20:2 the great dragon is 
identified with Satan. See Dan. 7 for many of the items 
here, like the ten horns (Dan. 7:7) and hurling the stars 
(Dan. 8:10). The word occurs in the Apocalypse alone in 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 389 


the N.T. Seven diadems (hepta diadémata). Old word from 
diadeé (to bind around), the blue band marked with white 
with which Persian kings used to bind on the tiara, so a 
royal crown in contrast with stephanos (chaplet or wreath 
like the Latin corona as in 2:10), in N.T. only here, 13:1; 
19:12. If Christ as Conqueror has “many diadems,” it is 
not strange that Satan should wear seven (ten in 13:1). 

4. His tail (hé oura autou). See g:10,19. Draweth (surei). 
Present active indicative of surd, old verb, to drag, here 
alone in the Apocalypse, but see John 21:8. The third part 
of the stars (to triton ton asteron). Like a great comet is this 
monster. See Dan. 8:10. Perhaps only the third is meant 
to soften the picture as in Rev. 8:7f. Did cast them (ebalen 
autous). Second aorist active indicative. Charles takes this 
to refer to a war in heaven between the good angels and 
Satan, with the fall of some angels (Jude 6). But John 
may have in mind the martyrs before Christ (Heb. 11:32f.) 
and after Christ’s ascension (Matt. 23:35). Stood (estéken). 
Imperfect active of a late verb, stékd, from the perfect 
hestéka of histemi, graphic picture of the dragon’s challenge 
of the woman who is about to give birth. When she was 
delivered (hotan tekéi). Indefinite temporal clause with hotan 
and the second aorist active subjunctive of #iktd, “whenever 
she gives birth.” That he might devour (hina kataphagii). 
Purpose clause with hing and the second aorist active sub- 
junctive of katesthid, to eat up (down). Cf. Jer. 28:34. 
This is what Pharaoh did to Israel (Ex. 1:15-22; Ps. 85:13; 
Is. 27:1; 51:9; Ezek. 29:3). Precisely so the devil tried to 
destroy the child Jesus on his birth. 

5. She was delivered of a son (eteken huion). Literally, 
“she bore a son” (second aorist active indicative of sikto). 
A man child (arsen). So A C with the neuter teknon or 
paidion in mind, as often in O.T. (eteken arsen, Ex. 1:16ff.; 
2:2; Lev. 12:2, 7; Is. 66:7; Jer. 20:15, etc.), but P and some 
cursives read arsena (masculine accusative), as in verse 13 


390 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(ton arsena), while Aleph Q have arrena. The word is old 
(either arsén or arrén), as in Matt. 19:4, only in this chapter 
in the Apocalypse. It is really redundant after Auion (son), 
as in Tob. 6:12 (Aleph). Who is to rule all the nations with 
a-rod of iron (hos mellei poimainein panta ta ethné en rabdoi 
sidérai). See 2:27 for these words (from Ps. 2:9) applied 
there to victorious Christians also, and in 19:15 to the tri- 
umphant Christian. His rule will go beyond the Jews 
(Matt. 2:6). There is here, of course, direct reference to 
the birth of Jesus from Mary, who thus represented in her 
person this “ideal woman” (God’s people). Was caught 
unto God (herpasthé). First aorist passive indicative of 
harpazd, old verb for seizing or snatching away, as in John 
10:12, here alone in the Apocalypse. Reference to the as- 
cension of Christ, with omission of the ministry, crucifixion, 
and resurrection of Christ because he is here simply show- 
ing that “the Dragon’s vigilance was futile” (Swete). “The 
Messiah, so far from being destroyed, is caught up to a share 
in God’s throne” (Beckwith). 

6. Fled into the wilderness (ephugen eis ten erémon). Second 
aorist active indicative of pheugd. Here, of course, not 
Mary, but “‘the ideal woman” (God’s people) of the pre- 
ceding verses, who fled under persecution of the dragon. 
God’s people do not at once share the rapture of Christ, 
but the dragon is unable to destroy them completely. The 
phrases used here seem to be reminiscent of Deut. 8:2ff.. 
(wanderings of Israel in the wilderness), I Kings 17:2f. and 
19:3f. (Elijah’s flight), I Macc. 2:29 (flight of the Jews 
from Antiochus Epiphanes), Matt. 2:13 (flight of Joseph 
and Mary to Egypt), Mark 13:14 (the flight of Christians 
at the destruction of Jerusalem). Where (hopou—ekei). 
Hebrew redundancy (where—there) as in 3:8; 8:2, 9; 13:8, 
12; 17:9; 20:8. Prepared (hétoimasmenon). Perfect passive 
predicate participle of hetoimazd, for which verb see Matt. 
20:23; Rev. ‘8:63 927, 1539162123 19:73) 27:2} and forvits ‘use

with ¢opos John 14:2f. and for the kind of fellowship meant 
by it (Ps. 31:21; II Cor. 13:13; Col. 3:3; I John 1:3). Of 
God (apo tou theou). ‘Krom (by) God,” marking the source 
as God (9:18; James 1:13). This anticipatory symbolism 
is repeated in 12:13f. . That there they may nourish her (hina 
ekei trephosin autén). Purpose clause with hina and the 
present for continued action: active subjunctive according 
to A P though C reads trephousin, present active indicative, 
as is possible also in 13:17 and certainly so in I John 5:20 
(Robertson, Grammar, p. 984), a solecism in late vernacular 
Greek. The plural is indefinite “they” as in 10:11; 11:9. 
One MSS. has ¢rephetai (is nourished). The stereotyped - 
phrase occurs here, as in 11:2f., for the length of the dragon’s 
power, repeated in 12:14 in more general terms and again 
MARZ: 

7. There was war in heaven (egeneto polemos en toi ourandi). 
“There came to be war in heaven” (egeneto, not én). “An- 
other tableau, not a sémeion (vv. 1, 3), but consequent upon 
the two sémeia which precede it. The birth and rapture 
of the Woman’s Son issue in a war which invades the 
epourania”’ (Swete). The reference is not to the original 
rebellion of Satan, as Andreas held. As the coming of 
Christ brought on fresh manifestations of diabolic power 
(Mark 1:13; Luke 22:3, 31; John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11), just 
so Christ’s return to heaven is pictured as being the occasion 
of renewed attacks there. We are not to visualize it too 
literally, but certainly modern airplanes help us to grasp the 
notion of battles in the sky even more than the phalanxes of 
storm-clouds (Swete). John even describes this last con- 
flict as in heaven itself. Cf. Luke 10:18; I Kings 22:1ff.; 
Job 1 and 2; Zech. 3:1ff. Michael and his angels (ho Michaél 
kai hoi aggeloi autou). The nominative here may be in 
apposition with polemos, but it is an abnormal construction 
with no verb, though egeneto (arose) can be understood as 
repeated. Michael is the champion of the Jewish people 


392 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(Dan. 10:13, 21; 12:1) and is called the archangel in Jude 9. 
Going forth to war (tou polemésai). This genitive articular 
infinitive is another grammatical problem in this sentence. 
If egeneto (arose) is repeated as above, then we have the 
infinitive for purpose, a common enough idiom. Otherwise 
it is anomalous, not even like Acts 10:25. With the dragon 
(meta tou drakontos). On the use of meta with polemeé see 
2:16; 13:4; 17:14 (nowhere else in N.T.). The devil has 
angels under his command (Matt. 25:41) and preachers also 
(II Cor. 11:14f.). Warred (epolemésen). Constative aorist 
active indicative of polemed, picturing the whole battle in 
one glimpse. 

8. And they prevailed not (kai ouk ischusan). Here kai 
equals “and yet” or “but.” A few MSS. read the singular 
ischusen like epolemésen, but wrongly so. Neither was their 
place found any more (oude topos heurethé auton eti). First 
aorist passive indicative of heuriskd, to find. Probably 
auton is the objective genitive (place for them), just as in 
20:11 autois (dative, for them) is used with topos ouch 
heurethé. The phrase occurs in Dan. 2:35 Theod. and Zech. 
10:10. The dragon is finally expelled from heaven (cf. Job 
1:6), though to us it seems a difficult conception to think of 
Satan having had access to heaven. 

9. Was cast down (eblethé). Effective first aorist passive 
indicative of ball, cast down for good and all, a glorious 
consummation. This vision of final victory over Satan is ° 
given by Jesus in Luke 10:18; John 12:31. It has not come 
yet, but it is coming, and the hope of it should be a spur 
to missionary activity and zeal. The word megas (great) 
occurs here with drakdn as in 12:3, and the whole picture is 
repeated in 20:2. The dragon in both places is identified 
with the old serpent (Gen. 3:1ff.) and called archaios (from 
arché, beginning), as Jesus said that the devil was a mur- 
derer “from the beginning” (John 8:44). Both diabolos 
(slanderer) and Satan (Satands) are common in N.T. for 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 393 


this great dragon and old serpent, the chief enemy of man- 
kind. See on Matt. 4:1 and Rev. 2:10 for diabolos and 
Luke 10:18 for Satanads. The-deceiver of the whole world (ho 
planon tén oikoumenén holén). This is his aim and his oc- 
cupation, pictured here by the nominative articular present 
active participle of planad, to lead astray. For “the in- 
habited world” see Luke 2:1; Rev. 3:10; 16:14. Satan can 
almost “lead astray” the very elect of God (Matt. 24:24), 
so artful is he in his beguilings as he teaches us how to de- 
ceive ourselves (I John 1:8). He was cast down to the earth 
(cblethé eis tén gén). Effective aorist repeated from the be- 
ginning of the verse. “The earth was no new sphere of . 
Satan’s working” (Swete). Were cast down (ebléthésan). 
Triple use of the same verb applied to Satan’s minions. 
The expulsion is complete. 

10. 4 great voice saying (phonén megalen legousan). Ac- 
cusative after ékousa in this phrase as in 5:11; 10:4; 14:2; 
18:4, but the genitive phonés legousés in 11:12; 14:13. We 
are not told whence this voice or song comes, possibly from 
one of the twenty-four elders (Swete) or some other heavenly 
beings (11:15) who can sympathize with human beings 
(19:10), the martyrs in heaven (Charles). Now 1s come 
(arti egeneto). Arti (John 13:33) shows how recent the 
downfall of Satan here proleptically pictured as behind us 
in time (aorist tense egeneto). The salvation (hé sotéria). 
Here ‘‘the victory” asin 7:10;19:1. The power (hé dunamis). 
God’s power over the dragon (cf. 7:12; 11:17; 19:1). The 
kingdom (hé basileia). “The empire of God” asin 11:15. The 
authority of his Christ (hé exousia tou Christou autou). Which 
Christ received from the Father (Matt. 28:18; John 17:2). 
See 11:15 (Ps. 2:2) for “his Anointed.” The accuser (ho 
kategor). The regular form, katégoros, occurs in John 8:10; 
Acts 23:30, 35; 25:16, 18 and in many MSS. here in Rev. 
12:10, but A reads katégor, which Westcott and Hort accept. 
It was once considered a Greek transliteration of a Hebrew

word, but Deissmann (Light, etc., p. 93f.) quotes it from a 
vernacular magical papyrus of the fourth century a.p. with 
no sign of Jewish or Christian influence, just as diakon 
appears as a vernacular form of diakonos. Only here is the 
word applied to Satan in the N.T. In late Judaism Satan 
is the accuser, and Michael the defender, of the faithful. 
Of our brethren (tin adelphin hémén). The saints still on 
earth battling with Satan and his devices. Which accuseth 
them (ho kategoron autous). Articular present active par- 
ticiple of katégored, old verb, to accuse, usually with the 
genitive of the person (John 5:45), but here with the ac- 
cusative. This is the devil’s constant occupation (Job 1:6f.). 
Day and night (hémeras kai nuktos). Genitive of time. “By 
day and by night.” 

11. They overcame him (autoi enikésan). First aorist ac- 
tive indicative of nikad, the verb used by Jesus of his own 
victory (John 16:33) and about him (Rev. 3:21; 5:5). “The 
victory of the martyrs marks the failure of Satan’s en- 
deavours” (Swete). Because of the blood of the Lamb (dia 
to haima tou arniou). As in 1:5; 5:6, 9; 7:14. The blood of 
Christ is here presented by dia as the ground for the victory 
and not the means, as by em in 1:5; 5:9. Both ideas are 
true, but dia with the accusative gives only the reason. 
The blood of Christ does cleanse us from sin (John 1:29; 
I John 1:7). Christ conquered Satan, and so makes our 
victory possible (Luke 11:21f.; Heb. 2:18). ‘Thus the — 
Lamb is the true sunégoros [like Michael] of the New Israel, 
its paraklétos pros ton patera (I John 2:1)” (Swete). Because 
of the Word of their testimony (dia ton logon tés marturias 
auton). The same use of dia, “because of their testimony 
to Jesus” as in John’s own case in 1:9. These martyrs 
have been true to their part. They loved not their life even 
unto death (ouk égapésan tén psuchén auton achri thanatou). 
First aorist active indicative of agapaé. They did resist 
“unto blood” (mechris haimatos Heb. 12:4) and did not put 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 395 


their own lives before loyalty to Christ. There is a direct 
reference to the words of Jesus in John 12:25 as illustrated 
also in Mark 8:35; Matt. 10:39; 16:25; Luke 9:24; 17:33. 
Paul’s own example is pertinent (Acts 21:13; Phil. 1:20ff.). 
Jesus himself had been “‘obedient unto death” (Phil. 2:8). 
These martyrs seem to be still alive on earth, but their 
heroism is proleptically pictured. 

12. Therefore (dia touto). “‘For this reason”’ as in 7:15; 
18:8 (15 times in John’s Gospel, Charles notes). It points 
back to verse 10. Rejoice (euphrainesthe). Present middle 
imperative of euphraind as in 11:10; 18:20. O heavens (hoi 
ouranoi). Plurai here alone in the Apocalypse, though com- 
mon elsewhere in the N.T. Satan is no longer in the heavens. 
They that dwell therein (hot en autois skénountes). Present 
active articular participle of skénod (see 7:15 and 13:6) to 
dwell (tabernacle) as of Christ in John 1:14 and of God in 
Rev. 21:3. The inhabitants of heaven (angels and saints) 
have cause to rejoice, and earth reason to mourn. Woe for 
the earth and for the sea (ouai ten gén kai ten thalassan). 
The accusative after ouai as in 8:13, but nominative in 
18:10, 16, 19 in place of the usual dative (Matt. 11:21; 
18:7, etc.). Is gone down (katebé). Second aorist (effective). 
active indicative of katabaind, “did go down.” But a short 
time (oligon kairon). Accusative of extent of time, “a little 
time.” The devil’s departure from his warfare in the heavens 
reveals (eidds, knowing, perfect active participle) to him 
that his time for doing harm to men is limited, and hence 
his great wrath (thumon, boiling rage). 

13. He persecuted (edidxen). First aorist active participle 
of diodkd, to pursue, to chase, hostile pursuit here as in 
Matt. 5:10f.; 10:23, etc. John now, after the “voice” in 
10 to 13, returns to the narrative in verse 9. The child was 
caught away in verse 5, and now the woman (the true Israel 
on earth) is given deadly persecution. Perhaps events since 


A.D. 64 (burning of Rome by Nero) amply illustrated this 


>

vision, and they still do so. Which (hétis). “‘Which very 


one. 

14. There were given (edothésan). As in 8:2; 9:1, 3. The 
two wings of the great eagle (hai duo pteruges tou aetou tou 
megalou). Not the eagle of 8:13, but the generic use of 
the article. Every eagle had two wings. Probably here, 
as in Matt. 24:28, the griffon or vulture rather than the 
true eagle is pictured. For the eagle in the O.T. see Ex. 
19:4; Is. 40:31; Job 9:26; Prov. 24:54. That she might fly 
(hina petetai). Purpose clause with hina and present middle 
subjunctive of petomai, old verb, to fly, in N.T. only in the 
Apocalypse (4:7; 8:13; 12:14; 14:6; 19:17). Resumption of 
the details in verse 6 (which see) about the “wilderness,” 
her “place,” the redundant ekei with hopou, the “‘time and 
times, and half a time” (kairon kai kairous kai hémisu), 
1260 days, but with trephetai (present passive indicative) 
instead of trephosin (general plural of the present active 
subjunctive), and with the addition of ‘“‘from the face of 
the serpent” (apo prosdpou tou opheds), because the serpent 
rules the earth for that period. “To the end of the present 
order the Church dwells in the wilderness” (Swete), and 
yet we must carry on for Christ. 

15. Water as a flood (hudor hos potamon). “Water as a 
river,” accusative case after edalen (cast). The serpent 
could not follow the woman or stop her flight and so sought 
to drown her. That he might cause her to be carried away 
by the stream (hina autén potamophoréton poiéséi). Purpose 
clause with Aina and the first aorist active subjunctive of 
poied. For this use of poied see 17:16. This compound 
verbal potamophoréton in the predicate accusative (potamos, 
river, phoréton from phored, to bear) was not coined by 
John, but occurs in a papyrus of B.c. 110 and in several 
others after N.T. times. It means simply “carried awav 
by the river.” 

16. Helped the woman (eboéthésen tei gunaiki). First aorist 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 397 


active indicative of doéthed, old verb with the dative as in 
Heb. 2:18, which see. Herodotus tells of the Lycus dis- 
appearing underground near Colossae. But this vivid sym- 
bol is not dependent on historical examples. Swallowed up 
(katepien). Second aorist active indicative of katapind, lit- 
erally “drank down.” 

17. Waxed wroth (orgisthé). First aorist (ingressive) pas- 
sive indicative of orgizomai, “became angry.” With the 
woman (epi tei gunaiki). “At the woman,” “because of 
the woman.” Went away (apélthen). ‘Went off” in his 
rage to make war with the scattered followers of the Lamb 
not in the wilderness, perhaps an allusion to Gen. 3:15.” 
The devil carries on relentless war with all those ‘which 
keep the commandments of God and hold the testimony 
of Jesus” (¢6n térounton tas entolas tou theou kai echonton 
tén marturian Iésou). These two marks excite the wrath of 
the devil then and always. Cf. 1:9; 6:9; 14:12; 19:10; 20:4. 

18. He stood (estathé). First aorist passive indicative of 
histémi (intransitive), as in 8:3. “He stopped” on his way 
to war with the rest of the woman’s seed. P Q read here 
estathen (I stood) when it has to be connected with chapter 
13. Upon the sand (epi ten ammon). The accusative case 
as in 7:1; 8:3, etc. Ammos is an old word for sand, for 
innumerable multitude in 20:8. 


CHAPTER XIII 


1. Out of the sea (ek tés thalassés). See 11:7 for “the beast 
coming up out of the abyss.” The imagery comes from 
Dan. 7:3. See also Rev. 17:8. This “wild beast from the 
sea,” as in Dan. 7:17, 23, is a vast empire used in the in- 
terest of brute force. This beast, like the dragon (12:3), 
has ten horns and seven heads, but the horns are crowned, 
not the heads. The Roman Empire seems to be meant 
here (17:9, 12). On “diadems”’ (diadémata) see 12:3, only 
ten here, not seven as there. Names of blasphemy (onomata 
blasphémias). See 17:3 for this same phrase. The meaning 
is made plain by the blasphemous titles assumed by the 
Roman emperors in the first and second centuries, as shown 
by the inscriptions in Ephesus, which have ¢heos constantly 
applied to them. 

2. Like unto a leopard (homoion pardalei). Associative- 
instrumental case of pardalis, old word for panther, leopard, 
here only in N.T. The leopard (/eo, pard) was considered a 
cross between a panther and a lioness. 4s the feet of a bear 
(és arkou). Old word, also spelled arktos, here only in 
N.T. From Dan. 7:4. No word in the Greek for “feet” 
before “bear.” 4s the mouth of a lion (hds stoma leontos). ° 
From Dan. 7:4. This beast combines features of the first 
three beasts in Dan. 7:2ff. The strength and brutality of 
the Babylonian, Median, and Persian empires appeared in 
the Roman Empire. The catlike vigilance of the leopard, 
the slow and crushing power of the bear, and the roar of 
the lion were all familiar features to the shapes in Pales- 
tine (Swete). The dragon gave him (edoken autoi ho drakon). 
First aorist active indicative of diddmi (to give) and dative 
case autoi (the beast). The dragon works through this beast. 

398 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 399 


The beast is simply Satan’s agent. Satan claimed this power 
to Christ (Matt. 4:9; Luke 4:6) and Christ called Satan the 
prince of this world (John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11). So the 
war is on. 

3. And I saw (kai). No verb (eidon) in the old MSS., 
but clearly understood from verse 2. 4s though it had been 
smitten (his esphagmenén). Perfect passive participle of 
Sphazo, as in §:6, accusative singular agreeing with mian 
(one of the heads), object of eidon understood, ‘‘as though 
slain” (so the word means in seven other instances in the 
book). There is a reference to the death and new life of 
the Lamb in 5:6. And his death-stroke was healed (kai hé- 
plégé autou etherapeuthé). First aorist passive indicative of 
therapeuod. ““The stroke of death” (that led to death). 
Apparently refers to the death of Nero in June 68 a.p. by 
his own hand. But after his death pretenders arose claim- 
ing to be Nero redivivus even as late as 89 (Tacitus, Hist. 
i. 78, ii. 8, etc.). John seems to regard Domitian as Nero 
over again in the persecutions carried on by him. The dis- 
tinction is not always preserved between the beast (Roman 
Empire) and the seven heads (emperors), but in 17:10 the 
beast survives the loss of five heads. Here it is the death- 
stroke of one head, while in verses 12, 14 the beast himself 
receives a mortal wound. Wondered after the beast (ethau- 
masthé opiso tou thériou). First aorist passive (deponent) 
indicative of thaumazd, to wonder at, to admire, as in 17:8. 
For this pregnant use of opisd see John 12:9; Acts §:37; 
20:30; I Tim. 5:15. “All the earth wondered at and fol- 
lowed after the beast,” that is Antichrist as represented by 
Domitian as Nero redivivus. But Charles champions the 
view that Caligula, not Nero, is the head that received the 
death-stroke and recovered and set up statues of himself 
for worship, even trying to do it in Jerusalem. 

4. They worshipped the dragon (prosekunésan toi drakonti). 
First aorist active indicative of proskuned, with dative case 


400 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


drakonti (from drakon). They really worshipped Satan (the 
dragon) when “they worshipped the beast” (prosekunésan 
toi theridi) or any one of the heads (like Caligula, Nero, 
Domitian) of the beast. The beast is merely the tool of 
the devil for worship. Recall the fact that the devil even 
proposed that Jesus worship him. Emperor-worship, like 
all idolatry, was devil-worship. The same thing is true 
today about self-worship (humanism or any other form of 
it). Who is like unto the beast? (tis homotios toi thériot;). 
Associative-instrumental case after homoios. An echo, per- 
haps parody, of like language about God in Ex. 15:11; Ps. 
35:10; 113:5. ““The worship of such a monster as Nero was 
indeed a travesty of the worship of God” (Swete). dnd 
who is able to war with him? (kai tis dunatai polemésai met 
autou;). Worship of the devil and the devil’s agent is justi- 
fied purely on the ground of brute force. It is the doctrine 
of Nietzsche that might makes right. 

5. There was given to him (edothé autoi). First aorist 
passive indicative of diddmi, to give, as in next line and 
verse 7. Perhaps a reference to edoken (he gave) in verse 4, 
where the dragon (Satan) gave the beast his power. The 
ultimate source of power is God, but the reference seems 
to be Satan here. Speaking great things and blasphemies 
(laloun megala kai blasphémias). Present active participle 
of Jaled, agreeing with stoma (nominative neuter singular 
and subject of edothé). The words are like Daniel’s descrip- 
tion of the Little Horn (7:8, 20, 25) and like the description 
of Antiochus Epiphanes (I Macc. 1:24). Cf. II Pet. 2:11. 
To continue (poiésai). First aorist active infinitive (epexe- 
getic use) of poied, either in the sense of working (signs), 
as in Dan. 8:12, 14, with the accusative of duration of time 
(ménas months), or more likely in the sense of doing time, 
with ménas as the direct object as in Matt. 20:12; Acts 
20:3; James 4:13. 

6. For blasphemies (eis blasphémias). “For the purpose 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 401 


of blasphemies.” Against God (pros ton theon). ‘Face to 
face with God” in sheer defiance, like Milton’s picture of 
Satan in Paradise Lost. See Dan. 7:25; 8:10. The aorist 
énoixen is probably constative, for he repeated the blas- 
phemies, though the phrase (anoigd to stoma, to open the 
mouth) is normally ingressive of the beginning of an utter- 
ance (Matt. 5:2; Acts 8:35). This verse explains verse 5. 
The Roman emperors blasphemously assumed divine names 
in public documents. They directed their blasphemy against 
heaven itself (“his tabernacle,” sé skénén autou, 7:15; 
12:12; 21:3) and against “them that dwell in the heaven” 
(tous en toi ourandi skénountas), the same phrase of 12:12 
(either angels or the redeemed or both). 

7. To make war with the saints and to overcome them 
(poiésai polemon meta ton hagion kai nikésai autous). ‘This 
clause with two epexegetical first aorist active infinitives 
(polemésai and nikésai) is omitted in A C P, but probably 
by homeoteleuton (like ending) because of the repetition of 
edothé. The words seem to come from Dan. 7:21, 23. There 
was no escape from the beast’s rule in the Mediterranean 
world. See 5:9 for the phrases here used, there for praise 
to the Lamb. 

8. Shall worship him (proskunésousin auton). Future ac- 
tive of proskuned with the accusative here as some MSS. 
in 13:4 (¢o thérion), both constructions in this book. Whose 
(hou—autou). Redundant use of genitive autou (his) with 
hou (whose) as common in this book, and singular instead 
of plural hon with antecedent pantes (all, plural), thus call- 
ing attention to the responsibility of the individual in em- 
peror-worship. Hath not been written (ou gegraptai). Per- 
fect passive indicative of graphd, permanent state, stands 
written. In the book of life of the Lamb (en toi biblio: tes 
z0és tou arniou). See 3:5 for this phrase and the O.T. 
references. It occurs again in 17:8; 20:12, 15; 21:27. “Here 
and in 21:27, the Divine Register is represented as belong- 


402 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


ing to ‘the Lamb that was slain’”’ (Swete). That hath been 
slain from the foundation of the world (tou esphagmenou (for 
which see 5:6) apo katabolés kosmou). For the phrase apo 
katabolés kosmou (not in the LXX) there are six other N.T. 
uses (Matt. 13:35 without kosmou; 25:34; Luke 11:50; Heb. 
4:3; 9:26; Rev. 17:8), and for pro kataboles kosmou three 
(John 17:24; Eph. 1:4; I Pet. 1:20). It is doubtful here 
whether it is to be taken with tou esphagmenou (cf. I Pet. 
1:20) or with gegraptai as in Rev. 17:8. Either makes sense, 
and here the most natural use is with esphagmenou. At any 
rate the death of Christ lies in the purpose of God, as in 
John 3:16. 

g. If any one hath an ear (ei tis echei ous). Condition of 
first class, repetition of the saying in 2:7, II, 17, 29, etc. 

10. If any man is for captivity (ei tis eis aichmalosian). 
Condition of first class, but with no copula (esti) expressed. 
For aichmalosian (from aichmalotos captive) see Eph. 4:8, 
only other N.T. example. Apparently John means this as 
a warning to the Christians not to resist force with force, 
but to accept captivity as he had done as a means of grace. 
Cf. Jer. 15:2. The text is not certain, however. If any 
man shall kill with the sword (ei tis en machairéi apoktenet). 
First-class condition with future active of apokteind, not 
future passive, for it is a picture of the persecutor drawn 
here like that by Jesus in Matt. 26:52. Must he be killed 
(dei auton en machairéi apoktanthénai). First aorist passive: 
infinitive of apokteind. The inevitable conclusion (dei) of 
such conduct. The killer is killed. Here (Adde). In this 
attitude of submission to the inevitable. For hdde see 13:18; 
14:12; 17:9. “Faith” (pistis) here is more like faithfulness, 
fidelity. 

11. Another beast (allo therion). Like the first beast (verse 
1), not a heteron thérion (a different beast). Out of the earth 
(ek tes gés). Not “out of the sea” as the first (verse 1), 
perhaps locating him in Asia Minor without world-wide 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 403 


scope, but plainly the agent of the first beast and so of the 
dragon. He had (eichen). Imperfect active of echd. Only 
two horns (not ten like the first, verse 1). Like unto a lamb 
(homoia arnioi). Usual construction. Only the two horns 
of a young lamb and without the ferocity of the other beast, 
but “he spake as a dragon” (elalei hos drakon). Gunkel and 
Charles confess their inability to make anything out of 
this item. But Swete thinks that he had the roar of a 
dragon with all the looks of a lamb (weakness and innocence). 
Cf. the wolves in sheep’s clothing (Matt. 7:15). 

12. He exerciseth (poiei). Present active dramatic present 
of poied. In his sight (endpion autou). In the eye of the. 
first beast who gets his authority from the dragon (13:2). 
The second beast carries on the succession of authority from 
the dragon and the first beast. It has been a common 
Protestant interpretation since the Reformation of Luther 
to see in the first beast Pagan Rome and in the second beast 
Papal Rome. There is undoubted verisimilitude in this 
interpretation, but it is more than doubtful if any such view 
comes within the horizon of the imagery here. Ramsay 
takes the first beast to be the power of imperial Rome and 
the second beast to be the provincial power which imitated 
Rome in the persecutions. To worship the first beast (hina 
proskunésousin to thérion to proton). Sub-final clause with 
hina after poiei seen in John 11:37; Col. 4:16; Rev. 3:9, 
usually with the subjunctive, but here with the future in- 
dicative as in 3:9. Note the accusative after proskuneo as 
in verse 8. Here the death-stroke of one of the heads (verse 
3) is ascribed to the beast. Clearly the delegated authority 
of the provincial priests of the emperor-worship is rigorously 
enforced, if this is the correct interpretation. 

13. That he should even make fire come down out of heaven 
(hina kai pur poiti ck tou ouranou katabainein). Purpose 
clause again with hina and the present active subjunctive - 
of poied and the object infinitive of katabaind after potei. 


404 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Christ promised great signs to the disciples (John 14:12), 
but he also warned them against false prophets and false 
christs with their signs and wonders (Mark 13:22). So also 
Paul had pictured the power of the man of sin (II Thess. 
2:9). Elijah had called down fire from heaven (I Kings 
18:38; II Kings 1:10) and James and John had once even 
urged Jesus to do this miracle (Luke 9:54). 

14. And he deceiveth (kai planai). Present active (dra- 
matic) indicative of planad, the very thing that Jesus had 
said would happen (Matt. 24:24, “So as to lead astray” 
hoste planasthai, the word used here, if possible the very 
elect). It is a constant cause for wonder, the gullibility of 
the public at the hands of new charlatans who continually 
bob up with their pipe-dreams. That they should make an 
image to the beast (poiésai eikona toi thérioi). Indirect com- 
mand (this first aorist active infinitive of poied) after legin 
as in Acts 21:21, not indirect assertion. This “image” 
(etkon, for which word see Matt. 22:20; Col. 1:15) of the 
emperor could be his head upon a coin (Mark 12:16), an 
imago painted or woven upon a standard, a bust in metal or 
stone, a statue, anything that people could be asked to 
bow down before and worship. This test the priests in the 
provinces pressed as it was done in Rome itself. The phrase 
“the image of the beast,” occurs ten times in this book 
(13:14,°15 fers 1429, 13 15:2; 16:2; '19:20;:20:4), »Emperor- 
worship is the issue and that involves worship of the devil. . 
The stroke of the sword (tén plegén tés machairés). This 
language can refer to the death of Nero by his own sword. 
And lived (kai exésen). “And he came to life” (ingressive 
first aorist active indicative of za0). - Perhaps a reference to 
Domitian as a second Nero in his persecution of Christians. 

15. To give breath to it (dounai pneuma aut?i). This sec- 
ond beast, probably a system like the first (not a mere 
person), was endowed with the power to work magical 
tricks, as was true of Simon Magus and Apollonius of Tyana 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 405 


and many workers of legerdemain since. Pneuma here has 
its original meaning of breath or wind like pneuma xoés 
(breath of life) in 11:11. Even to the image (tei eikoni). 
No “even” in the Greek, just apposition with auféi (her). 
That should both speak and cause (hina kai laleséi kai poiéséi). 
Final clause with Aina and the first aorist active subjunctive 
of Jaled and poied. Ventriloquism like that in Acts 16:16. 
That should be killed (hina apoktanthosin). Sub-final clause 
with Aina and the first aorist passive subjunctive of apok- 
teind, after poiéséi, as in verse 12 (future indicative). 4s 
many as should not worship (hosoi ean mé proskunésosin). 
Indefinite relative clause with modal ean (=an) and the. 
first aorist active subjunctive of proskuned with the accusa- 
tive én eikona (some MSS. the dative). Note the triple 
use of “the image of the beast” in this sentence. ‘‘That 
refusal to worship the image of the emperor carried with 
it capital punishment in Trajan’s time is clear from Pliny’s 
letter to Trajan (X. 96)” (Charles). 

16. He causeth all (same use of poied as in 12 and 15). 
Note article here with each class (the small and the great, 
etc.). That there be given them (hina dosin autois). Same 
use of hina after poied as in 12 and 15, only here with in- 
definite plural désin (second aorist active subjunctive), “that 
they give themselves,” as in 10:11; 12:6; 16:15. 4 mark 
(charagma). Old word from charassd, to engrave, in Acts 
17:29 of idolatrous images, but in Rev. (13:16, 17; 14:9, 
I1; 16:2; 19:20; 20:4) of the brand of the beast on the right 
hand or on the forehead or on both. Deissmann (Bible 
Studies, pp. 240ff.) shows that in the papyri official business 
documents often have the name and image of the emperor, 
with the date as the official stamp or seal and with charagma 
as the name of this seal. Animals and slaves were often 
branded with the owner’s name, as Paul (Gal. 6:17) bore 
the stigmata of Christ. Ptolemy Philadelphus compelled 


some Alexandrian Jews to receive the mark of Dionysus 


406 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


as his devotees (III Macc. 3:29). The servants of God re- 
ceive on their foreheads the stamp of the divine seal (Rev. 
7:3). Charles is certain that John gets his metaphor from 
the ¢ephillin (phylacteries) which the Jew wore on his left 
hand and on his forehead. At any rate, this ‘“mark of the 
beast” was necessary for life and all social and business 
relations. On the right hand, that is in plain sight. Upon 
their forehead (epi to metopon auton). Accusative with epi, 
though genitive Just before with cheiros (hand). See already 
7:33 9:4 (genitive epi ton metopon). Only in the Apocalypse 
in N.T. 

17. That no man should be able to buy or to sell (hina mé 
tis dunétai agorasai @ polésai). Final clause with hina and 
present middle subjunctive of dunamai with aorist active 
infinitives. This is a regular boycott (Ramsay, Seven Letters, 
p. 106f.) against all not worshippers of the emperor. Save 
(et me). “If not,” “except.” Even the name (to onoma). 
No “even,” just apposition with charagma (the mark). Or 
the number (é ton arithmon). The stamp (the mark) may 
bear either the name or the number of the beast. The name 
and the number are one and the same. They could write 
the name in numerals, for numbers were given by letters. 
Swete suggests that it was “‘according to a sort of gematria 
known to the Apocalyptist and his Asian readers, but not 
generally intelligible.” 

18. Here is wisdom (hide hé sophia). The puzzle that . 
follows as in 17:9. See Eph. 1:17 for “a spirit of wisdom 
and of understanding.” He that understands (ho echon noun). 
“The one having intelligence” in such matters. Cf. the 
adverb nounechdos (discreetly) in Mark 12:34. Let him count 
(psephisato). First active imperative of pséphizd, old verb 
(from pséphos pebble), to count, in N.T. only here and Luke 
14:28. The number of a man (arithmos anthripou). “A 
man’s number.” But what man and what name? Six 
hundred and sixty-six (hexakosioi hexekonta hex). Unfor- 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 407 


tunately some MSS. here read 616 instead of 666. Alf sorts 
of solutions are offered for this conundrum. Charles is 
satisfied with the Hebrew letters for Nero Cesar, which 
give 666, and with the Latin form of Nero (without the 
final n), which makes 616. Surely this is ingenious and it 
may be correct. But who can really tell? 


CHAPTER XIV 


1. The Lamb (to arnion). See 5:6; 7:17; 12:11; 13:8 and 
is in contrast with the anarthrous arnion in 13:11. This 
proleptic vision of the Lamb “standing on the mount Zion” 
(hestos epi to oros Sion, second perfect active participle 
neuter of histémi with epi and accusative) is reasoning after 
the visions of the two beasts. Mount Zion is the site of 
the new city of God (Heb. 12:22), the Jerusalem above 
(Gal. 4:26), the seat of the Messianic Kingdom whether 
heaven or the new earth (Rev. 21 and 22). These victors 
have the name of the Lamb and God upon their foreheads 
as in 3:12 and 22:4, in place of the mark of the beast above 
(13:16; 14:11). This seal protects them (9:4). 4 hundred 
and forty and four thousand (hekaton tesserakonta tessares 
chiliades). “Thousands” literally (chi/ias feminine word for 
a thousand and so echousai feminine plural). For the 144,000 
see 7:5, 8, though some scholars seek a distinction somehow. 

2. As a voice of many waters (hos phonén hudaton pollon). 
For which see 1:15. Of a@ great thunder (brontés megalés). 
For which see 6:1; 19:6. For this voice out of heaven see 
10:4; 14:15; 18:4 and note accusative with @kousa. As the 
voice of harpers harping with their harps (hos kitharoidon. 
kitharizonton en tais kitharais auton). Triple use of kithara 
(5:8), kitharoidon (18:22), kitharizonton (old verb kithariz6, 
in N.T. only here and I Cor. 14:7). Wonderful melody in 
this chorus by the angels, not by the 144,000. 

3. They sing as it were a new song (aidousin hos oiden 
kainén). See §:9 for this phrase (cognate accusative) save 
that here Ads (as if) is added. There the new song was 
sung by the four living creatures and the elders, but here 
“before” (endpion) them and so apparently by the thron 

408 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 409 


who were themselves redeemed by the Lamb. No man could 
learn the song save (oudeis edunato mathein tén didén ei mé). 
Imperfect (edunato) of dunamai and second aorist (ingres- 
sive) active infinitive of manthand. In 5:9-12 the angels 
join in the song. In.15:3 it is the Song of Moses and the 
Lamb. Even they that had been purchased out of the earth 
(hoi égorasmenoi apo tés gés). Perfect passive articular par- 
ticiple of agorazd, purchased by the blood of the Lamb (5:9), 
masculine plural in apposition with chiliades (thousands) 
feminine plural (7:5, 8; 14:1). 4po (from) here, though e& 
(out of) in §:9. The 144,000 are not yet separated from the 
earth (John 17:15). Whether the 144,000 here are identical ~ 
with that number in 7:4-8 or not, they must embrace both 
men and women. 

4. Were not defiled with women (meta gunaikon ouk emo- 
lunthésan). First aorist passive indicative of molund, old 
verb, to stain, already in 3:4, which see. The use of this 
word rules out marriage, which was not considered sinful. 
For they are virgins (parthenoi gar eisin). Parthenos can be 
applied to men as well as women. Swete takes this lan- 
guage “‘metaphorically, as the symbolical character of the 
Book suggests.” Charles considers it an interpolation in 
the interest of celibacy for both men and women. If taken 
literally, the words can refer only to adultery or fornication 
(Beckwith). Jesus recognised abstinence only for those able 
to receive it (Matt. 19:12), as did Paul (I Cor. 7:1, 8, 32, 36). 
Marriage is approved by Paul in I Tim. 4:3 and by Heb. 
13:4. The New Testament exalts marriage and this passage 
should not be construed as degrading it. Whithersoever he 
goeth (hopou an hupagei). Indefinite local clause with modal 
an and the present active indicative of hupagd. The Chris- 
tian life is following the Lamb of God as Jesus taught 
(Mark 2:14; 10:21; Luke 9:59; John 1:43; 21:19, etc.) and 
as Peter taught (I Pet. 2:21) and John (I John 2:6). Were 
purchased from among men (égorasthésan apo ton anthropon). 


410 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


First aorist passive indicative of agorazd, repeating the close 
of verse 3. First fruits (aparché). See for this word I Cor. 
16:15; Rom. 11:16; 16:5. This seems to mean that the 
144,000 represent not the whole, but only a portion of the 
great harvest to come (Matt. 9:37), not only the first in- 
stalment, but those marked by high spiritual service to 
God and the Lamb (Rom. 12:1; Heb. 13:15; I Pet. 2:5). 

5. Was found no lie (ouch heurethé pseudos). First aorist 
passive indicative of heuriskd. In I Pet. 2:23 this passage 
(Is. 53:9) is quoted with dolos (deceit, guile) instead of 
pseudos (lie), but the difference is not great. Without 
blemish (amomoi). Alpha privative and mdmos (blemish, 
spot). As Christ the Paschal Lamb is (I Pet. 1:19; Heb. 
g:14), so the followers of the Lamb are to be in the end 
(Phil $233 ae 

6. Another angel (allon aggelon). A new turn in the drama 
comes with each angel (7:2; 8:3, 13; 10:1). Here the angel 
is seen “flying in mid heaven” (petomenon en mesourané- 
mati), while in 8:13 John heard him “flying in mid heaven” 
(genitive case of same participle, which see). This one is 
in the sight and hearing of all. Having (echonta). Accusa- 
tive singular agreeing with agge/on like petomenon (flying), 
but /egdn in verse 7 is nominative, as if a new sentence like 
legon in 4:1. An eternal gospel (euaggelion aionion). ‘The 
only use of euaggelion i in John’ s writings, though the verb 
euaggelisai (first aorist active infinitive epexegetical with 
echonta like John 16:12) occurs here and in 10:7. Here it 
Is not fo euaggelion (the gospel), but merely a proclamation 
of God’s eternal (aidnios here alone in the Apocalypse, 
though common in the Fourth Gospel and I John) purpose. 
Origen even took this ‘“‘eternal gospel” to be another book 
to be written! Note the double use of epi (with accusative 
after euaggelisai and the genitive with gés). See §:9 for 
the races, etc. 


7. And he saith (legon). See above. Fear God (phobéethéte 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 4Il 


ton theon). First aorist passive (deponent) imperative of 
phobeomai, here transitive with the accusative as in Luke 
12:5. It is a call to judgment with no hope offered except 
by implication (Acts 14:15ff.). Give him glory (dote autoi 
doxan). Second aorist active indicative of didami. For 
the phrase see 11:13. The hour is come (hé hora élthen). 
Second aorist (prophetic use) active indicative of erchomai. 
Common idiom in John’s Gospel (2:4; 4:21, 23; 5:25, 28; 
7:30, etc.). Worship (proskunésate). First aorist active 
imperative of proskuned with the dative case. Solemn call 
to the pagan world to worship God as Creator (4:11; 10:6), 
as in Ps. 96:6; Acts 14:15. For “the fountains of waters” — 
see 8:10. 

8. Another, a second angel (allos deuteros aggelos). This 
second angel “‘followed”’ (2kolouthésen, first aorist active in- 
dicative of akolouthed) and interpreted in part the first one. 
Fallen, fallen (epesen, epesen). Prophetic aorist active in- 
dicative of pipto, repeated as a solemn dirge announcing 
the certainty of the fall. The English participle “fallen, 
fallen” is more musical and rhythmical than the literal 
rendering “fell, fell.” The language is an echo of Is. 21:9, 
though B in the LXX has peptoken, peptoken (perfect). 
Babylon the great (Babulon hé magalé). The adjective megalé 
occurs with Babulon each time in the Apocalypse (14:8; 
16:19; 17:5; 18:2, 10, 21) as a reminder of Nebuchadrezzar. 
There is no doubt that Rome is meant by Babylon, as is 
probably seen already in I Pet. 5:13. As a prisoner in 
Patmos John can speak his mind by this symbolism. Hath 
made to drink (pepotiken). Perfect active indicative of 
potizd, old causative verb (from potos drinking, I Pet. 4:3), 
as in Matt. 25:35. The remarkable phrase that follows 
seems based on Jer. 51:8 (25:15). It is a combination also 
of Rev. 14:10 (the wine of God’s wrath, also in 16:19; 
19:15) and 17:2. There is no doubt of the dissoluteness of 
the old Babylon of Jeremiah’s day as of the Rome of John’s 


412 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


time. Rome is pictured as the great courtesan who in- 
toxicates and beguiles the nations to fornication (17:2, 4, 6), 
but the cup of God’s wrath for her and her paramours is 
full (14:10; 16:19; 18:2). 

g. A third (tritos). “The third of this succession of herald 
angels denounces the Cesar-worshippers” (Swete). Cf. 
13:12. This counter proclamation (verses 9-12) warns 
those tempted to yield to the threats of the second beast 
about boycott and death (13:11-17). If any man worship- 
peth the beast and his image (ei tis proskunei to thérion kat 
tén eikona autou). Condition of first class challenging those 
afraid of the beast. Note accusative (thérion) after pros- 
kunei, not dative as in verse 7. And receiveth a mark (kat 
lambanei charagma). Carries on the same condition and 
picks up the very language of 13:16. These Czsar-wor- 
shippers are guilty of an “eternal sin” (Mark 3:29). 

10. He also shall drink (kai autos pietai). Future middle 
of pind. Certainty for him as for Babylon and her para- 
mours (16:17). Of the wine of the wrath of God (ek tou oinou 
tou thumou tou theou). Note ek (partitive) after pietai. In 
16:19 and 19:15 we have both thumou and orgés (wrath of 
the anger of God). The white heat of God’s anger, held 
back through the ages, will be turned loose. Prepared un- 
mixed (tou kekerasmenou akratou). A bold and powerful 
oxymoron, “the mixed unmixed.” Akratos is an old ad- 
jective (alpha privative and kerannumi to mix) used of 
wine unmixed with water (usually so mixed), here only in 
N.T. So it is strong wine mixed (perfect passive participle 
of kerannumi) with spices to make it still stronger (cf. Ps. 
75:9). In the cup of his anger (en toi potéerioi tés orgés autou). 
Both thumos (vehement fury) and orgé (settled indignation). 
He shall be tormented (basanisthésetai). Future passive of 
basanizo. See 9:5; 11:10. With fire and brimstone (en puri 
kai theioi). See 9:17 for fire and brimstone and also 19:20; 
20:10; 21:8. The imagery is already in Gen. 19:24; Is. 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 413 


30:33; Ezek. 38:22. In the presence of the holy angels and 
in the presence of the Lamb (endpion aggelon hagion kai 
enopion tou arniou). This holy environment adds to the 
punishment. 

11. The smoke of their torment (ho kapnos tou basanismou 
auton). See 9:5 for basanismos, only there it was a limited 
penalty, here it is “for ever and ever” (eis aionas aionon, 
unto ages of ages). See also 18:9; 19:3; 20:10. They have 
no rest (ouk echousin anapausin). The very language used 
in 4:8 of the four living creatures in praising God. “Those 
who desert Christ for Czsar will be the victims of a remorse 
that never dies or sleeps” (Swete). The rest of the verse 
repeats the solemn challenge of verse 9. 

12. Here is the patience of the saints (Hide hé hupomoné 
ton hagion estin). John’s own comment as in 13:10; 17:9. 
In this struggle against emperor worship lay their oppor- 
tunity (Rom. 5:3). It was a test of loyalty to Christ. They 
that keep (hoi térountes). In apposition with ton hagion 
(genitive), though nominative, a frequent anacoluthon in 
this book (2:20, etc.). Cf. 12:17. The faith of Fesus (tén 
pistin Iésou). “The faith in Jesus” (objective genitive) as 
in 2:13; Mark 11:22; James 2:1. 

13. Write (Grapson). First aorist active imperative of 
grapho as in 1:11. John’s meditation is broken by this 
command. This new beatitude (makarioi, Blessed) for the 
Christian dead goes farther than Paul’s words (I Thess. 
4:14-16; I Cor. 15:18). Probably “from henceforth” (ap’ 
arti) goes with “those who die in the Lord,” giving comfort 
to those facing persecution and death. That they may rest 
(hina anapaesontai). Purpose clause with hina and the 
second future passive of anapaud. From their labours (ek 
ton kopon auton). From the toils, the wearinesses, but not 
from the activities (erga), for these “follow with them.” 
There is this to comfort us for all our growth here. Even 


414 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


if cut short, it can be utilized in heaven, which is not a 
place of idleness, but of the highest form of spiritual service. 

14. 4 white cloud (nephelé leuké). Like the “bright cloud” 
of Matt. 17:5 (Transfiguration), a familiar object in the 
Mediterranean lands. See Dan. 7:13; Matt. 24:30; 26:64; 
Acts 1:9, 11 for the picture of Christ’s return. I saw one 
sitting (kathémenon). No eidon here, but the accusative 
follows the eidon at the beginning, as nephelé is nominative 
after idou, as in 4:1, 4. Like unto a son of man (homoion 
huion anthropou). Accusative here after homoion as in 1:13, 
instead of the usual associative instrumental (13:4). Having 
(echon). Nominative again after the idou construction, just 
before, not after, eidon. A golden crown (stephanon chru- 
soun). Here a golden wreath, not the diadems of 19:12. 
4 sharp sickle (drepanon oxu). Old form drepané (from 
drepo, to pluck), pruning-hook, in N.T. only in this chapter 
and Mark 4:29. Christ is come for reaping this time (Heb. 
9:28) for the harvesting of earth (verses 15-17). The priest- 
hood of Christ is the chief idea in 1:12-20 and “‘as the true 
Imperator” (Swete) in chapter 19. 

15. Send forth (pempson). First aorist (urgency) active 
imperative of pempo. “Thrust in thy sickle now,” this 
angel urges Christ. And reap (kai therison). First aorist 
(urgency) active imperative of ¢herizd, old verb (from theros, 
summer), as in Matt. 6:26. See verse 7 for “‘the hour 1s 
come.” Therisai (to reap) is epexegetical infinitive (first 
aorist active of therizo). The harvest (ho therismos). Old, 
but rare word (from therizd, to harvest), as in Matt. 13:30; 
John 4:35, here only in Revelation. Is over-ripe (exéranthé). 
First aorist (prophetic as in 10:17; 15:1) passive of xéraind 
(cf. James 1:11), to wither, to dry up. Perhaps just “ripe,” 
hot Sower-riper? Ch Joel sary: 

16. Cast (ebalen). Second aorist active indicative of da/lé. 
No violence by the use of ebalen as is seen in Matt. 10:34 
(balein eirénén, to bring peace). Was reaped (etheristhé). 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 4ts 


First aorist passive indicative of therizd. Both prophetic 
aorists again. Christ puts in the sickle as he wills with his 
own agents (Matt. 9:37f.; 13:39, 41). 

17. He also (kai autos). As well as the Reaper on the 
cloud. This is the fifth angel who is God’s messenger from 
heaven (temple where God dwells). This fifth angel with 
his sharp sickle is to gather the vintage (18-20) as Christ 
did the wheat. 

18. Another angel (allos aggelos). The fifth angel above 
Swete terms “the Angel of vengeance.”” He responds to the 
call of the sixth angel here as Christ does to the call of the 
fourth angel in verse 15. Out from the altar (ek tou thusias- 
tériou). From the altar of incense where he is in charge of 
the fire (exousian epi tou puros). If it is the altar of burnt 
offering (6:9; 11:1), we are reminded of the blood of the 
martyrs (Swete), but if the altar of incense (8:3, 5; 9:13; 
16:7), then of the prayers of the saints. The sharp sickle 
(to drepanon to oxu). Useful for vintage as for harvesting. 
So “‘send forth” (pempson) asin verse 15. Gather (trugéson). 
First aorist active imperative of trugad, old verb (from trugé 
dryness, ripeness), in N.T. only Rev. 15:18f. and Luke 6:44. 
The clusters (tous botruas). Old word dotrus, here only in 
N.T. (Gen. 40:10). Her grapes (hai staphulai autés). Old 
word again for grapes, bunch of grapes, in N.T. only here, 
Matt. 7:16; Luke 6:44. re fully ripe (ékmasan). Old and 
common verb (from akmé, Matt. 15:16), to come to ma- 
turity, to reach its acme, here only in N.T. 

19. Cast (ebalen). As in verse 16. Gathered (etrugésen). 
Like etheristhé in verse 16, in obedience to the instructions 
in verse 18 (¢rugéson). The vintage of the earth (ten ampelon 
tés gés). ‘‘The vine of the earth.” Here ampelos is used 
for the enemies of Christ collectively pictured. And cast it 
(ebalen). Repeating ebalen and referring to ampelon (vin- 
tage) just before. Into the winepress the great winepress (eis 
tén lénon ton megan). Lénos is either feminine as in verse 


416 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


20 and 19:15, or masculine sometimes in ancient Greek. 
Here we have both genders, a solecism frequent in the 
Apocalypse (21:14 to teichos echon). See Matt. 21:33. For 
this metaphor of God’s wrath see 14:10; 15:1, 7; 16:1, 193 
19:15. 

20. Was trodden (epatethé). First aorist passive indicative 
of pated, to tread. The image of treading out the grapes is 
a familiar one in the East. Perhaps Is. 63:3 is in mind. 
Without the city (exdthen tés poleds). Ablative case with 
exothen (like exd). This was the usual place (Heb. 13:12). 
See exdthen in 11:2. Joel (3:12) pictures the vally of Jeho- 
shaphat as the place of the slaughter of God’s enemies. Cf. 
Zech. 14:4. Blood from the winepress (haima ek tés lénou). 
Bold imagery suggested by the colour of the grapes. Unto 
the bridles (achri ton chalinén). Old word (from chalad to 
slacken), in N.T. only here and James 3:3. Bold picture. 
As far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs (apo stadion 
chilion hexakosion). A peculiar use of apo, for “distance 
from (of)” as also in John 11:18; 21:8, somewhat like the 
use of pro in John 12:1. The distance itself covers the 
length of Palestine, but it is more likely that “‘the metaphor 
is worked out with the exuberance of apocalyptic symbol- 
ism” (Swete) for the whole earth. 


CHAPTER XV 


1. Another sign in heaven (allo sémeion en toi ourandi). 
Looking back to 12:1, 3, after the series intervening. The 
Seven Bowls are parallel with the Seven Seals (ch. 6) and 
the Seven Trumpets (chapters 8 to 11), but there is an even 
closer connection with chapters 12 to 14, “the drama of 
the long conflict between the church and the world” (Swete). 
Great and marvellous (mega kai thaumaston). Thaumastos 
is an old verbal adjective (from thaumazd, to wonder) and 
is already in Matt. 21:42. The wonder extends to the end 
of this vision or sign (16:21). Seven angels (aggelous hepta). 
Accusative case in apposition with sémeion after eidon. Cf. 
8:2. Which are the last (tas eschatas). “Seven plagues the 
last.” As in 21:9, “the final cycle of such visitations” 
(Swete). Js finished (etelesth@). Proleptic prophetic first 
aorist passive indicative of fe/ed as in 10:7. The number 
seven seems particularly appropriate here for finality and 
completeness. 

2. As it were a glassy sea (hos thalassan hualinen). Ac- 
cusative case after eidon and hos here, not in 4:6, which see 
for the symbol. Mingled with fire (memigmenén puri). Per- 
fect passive participle of mignumi, to mix, and the associa- 
tive instrumental case puri. This item not in 4:6 (a vision 
of peace), but here it adds to the splendour of the vision. 
This parenthesis (2 to 4) gives a picture of the martyrs in 
their state of bliss. Them that come off victorious (tous 
nikontas). Present active articular participle of nikad, ac- 
cusative after eidon, ‘‘those that come off victorious” (14:4). 
From the beast and from his image (ek tou theriou kai ek tés 
eikonos autou). ‘This use of ek after ikad is unusual, also 
with ek tou arithmou. For these items see 13:1, 14, 173 

417 


418 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


14:9, 11; 19:20; 20:4. By the glassy sea (epi tén thalassan 
ten hualinén). Or “upon” more likely (4:6) with the ac- 
cusative as in Matt. 14:25ff. Harps of God (kitharas tou 
theou). Objective genitive, for the worship of God (5:8; 
r420%.1¢Chron: 16.42), 

3. The song of Moses (tén cidén tou Mouseds). Ex. 14:31; 
15:1-19. A song of victory like that of Moses after crossing 
the Red Sea. And the song of the Lamb (tén didén tou arniou). 
A separate note of victory like that of Moses, though one 
song, not two. Charles finds it impossible to reconcile the 
two expressions, if genuine, but it is a needless objection. 
The words come from the O.T.: “great” (megala) from Ps. 
111:2, “wonderful” (¢haumasta) from Ps. 139:14, ““O Lord 
God the Almighty” (Kurie ho theos ho pantokrator) from 
Amos 4:13 (Rev. 4:8), “righteous and true” (dikaiai kai 
aléthinai) from Deut. 32:4, “Thou King of the ages” (ho 
basileus ton aidnon) like Jer. 10:10 and I Tim. 1:17. Some 
MSS. have “the king of the saints” and some “the king 
of the nations,” like Jer. 10:7. John thus combines in 
Hebraic tone the expressions of the old and the new in the 
song to the Glorified Messiah. 

4. Who shall not fear? (tis ou mé phobéthéi;). Rhetorical 
question with ou mé (double negative) and first aorist pas- 
sive subjunctive of phobeomai (future passive in Jer. 10:7). 
And glorify (kai doxasei). Change here to the future in- 
dicative instead of the aorist subjunctive, as often. Cf. © 
Ps. 86:9. Thou only art holy (monos hosios). Both predicate 
adjectives, “Thou art alone holy.” God alone is perfectly 
holy (16:5). Shall come (héxousin). . Future active of héko. 
And worship (kai proskunésousin). Future active of pros- 
kuneod. Both from Ps. 86:9. Have been made manifest 
(ephanerothésan). Prophetic first aorist passive indicative 
of phanerod. This martyr’s song has the ring of great 
poetry. 

5. The temple of the tabernacle of the testimony (ho naos 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 419 


tes skénés tou marturiou). Charles calls this “strange” lan- 
guage. Probably the tabernacle or tent of witness (Numb. 
9:15; 17:7) is in mind and the tent of meeting (Ex. 27:21) 
rather than the temple in Jerusalem. Was opened (énoigé'. 
Second aorist passive indicative of anoigd as in 11:19. For 
NGOS SCC 32125 7:153 14215, 173 1621, 17. 

6. There came out (exélthan). Second aorist active indica 
tive of exerchomai with -an rather than -on. Proleptic and 
prophetic aorist. The seven angels (hoi hepta aggeloi). Those 
in verse 1. The seven plagues (tas hepta plégas). The bowls 
are not given them till verse 7. Arrayed (endedumenoi). 
Perfect passive participle of endud. With precious stone pure 
and bright (lithon katharon lampron). Accusative case re- 
tained with verb of clothing as so often, literally “with a 
stone pure bright.” For both adjectives together see 19:8, 
14. Some MSS. read /inon (linen). For lithon see 17:4; 
18:16; Ezek. 28:13. Girt (periezdsmenoi). Perfect passive 
participle of perizinnud. See 1:13 for both participles. For 
stéthos (breast) see Luke 18:13. With golden girdles (zonas 
chrusas). Accusative case after the perfect passive par- 
ticiple periezosmenoi as in 1:13. 

7. Seven golden bowls (hepta phialas chrusas). Golden 
saucers, but not full of incense as in 5:8, but “full (gemousas 
for which see 5:8) of the wrath of God who liveth for eves 
and ever” (tou thumou tou theou tou zontos eis tous aionas 
ton aionon). Portents of dreadful events. 

8. Was filled with smoke (egemisthé kapnou). First aorist 
passive indicative of gemizd (from gemé), to fill full, and 
with the genitive kapnou (smoke). Smoke is here the sym- 
bol of God’s presence (Ex. 19:18; Is. 6:5). Till should be 
finished (achri telesthisin). ‘Temporal clause for future time 
with achri (equal to Aeds in import) and the first aorist 
passive subjunctive of te/ed, a metaphorical and symbolic 
“smoke screen” to keep all out of the sanctuary for the 
time being. 


CHAPTER XVI 


1. A great voice (megalés phonés). Not an angel as in 
$325 7:23 10:3; 14:7, 9, 15, 18, but of God as 15:8 shows, 
since no one could enter the naos. Pour out (ekcheete). 
Second aorist active imperative of ekched (same form as 
present active imperative). Blass would change to ekcheate 
(clearly aorist) as in verse 6. The seven bowls (tas hepta 
phialas). The article points to verse 7. 

2. Went and poured out (apélthen kai execheen). Second 
aorist active indicative of aperchomai (redundant use like 
hupagete with ekcheete, ““go and pour out,” in verse 1) and 
of ekched. Each angel “went off” to perform his task. 
For execheen see it repeated in verses 3, 4, 8, 10, 12,17. Into 
the earth (eis ten gen). This same use of eis after execheen 
in verses 3, 4. It became (egeneto). ‘There came” (second 
aorist middle indicative of ginomai). A noisome and griev- 
ous sore (helkos kakon kai ponéron). “Bad and malignant 
sore.” felkos is old word for a suppurated wound (Latin 
ulcus), here, verse 11, and Luke 16:21. See the sixth Egyp- 
tian plague (Ex. 9:10; Deut. 28:27, 35) and Job 2:7. The 
magicians were attacked in Egypt and the worshippers. of 
Ceesar here (13:17; 14:9, 11; 19:20). 

3- Into the sea (eis ten thalassan). Like the first Egyptian 
plague (Ex. 7:12-41) though only the Nile affected then. 
Blood as of a dead man (haima hos nekrou). At the trumpet 
(8:11) the water becomes wormwood. Here Ads nekrou is 
added to Ex. 7:19, “the picture of a murdered man welter- 
ing in his blood” (Swete). “Coagulated blood, fatal to 
animal life” (Moffatt). Every living soul (pasa psuché xdés). 
“Every soul of life” (Hebraism, Gen. 1:21, marked by life). 
Even the things that were in the sea (ta en t#i thalass#i). “The 

420 , 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 421 


’ 


things in the sea,” in apposition with psuché. Complete 
destruction, not partial as in 8:9. 

4. Into the rivers and the fountains of waters (eis tous 
potamous kai tas péegas ton hudaton). See 8:10 for this phrase. 
Contamination of the fresh-water supply by blood follows 
that of the sea. Complete again. 

5. The angel of the waters (tou aggelou ton hudaton). Geni- 
tive case object of @kousa. See 7:1 for the four angels in 
control of the winds and 14:18 for the angel with power over 
fire. The rabbis spoke also of an angel with power over the 
earth and another over the sea. Which art and which wast 
(ho On kai ho én). See this peculiar idiom for God’s eternity ~ 
with ho as relative before én” in 1:4, 8; 4:8, but without ho 
erchomenos (the coming on, the one who is to be) there for 
the future as in 11:17. Thou Holy One (ho hosios). Nom- 
inative form, but vocative case, as often. Note both dikaios 
and hosios applied to God as in 3:1 and 15:3f. Because 
thou didst thus judge (hott tauta ekrinas). Reason for calling 
God dikaios and hosios. The punishment on the waters is 
deserved. First aorist active indicative of krind, to judge. 

6. For (hoti). Second causal conjunction (Aoti) explana- 
tory of the first Aoti, like the two cases of Aoti in 15:4. They 
poured out (exechean). Second aorist active indicative of 
ekcheo with -an instead of -on. Blood hast thou given them 
to drink (haima autois dedokas pein). Haima (blood) is 
the emphatic word, measure for measure for shedding the 
blood of saints and prophets (11:18; 18:24). Perfect active 
indicative of diddmi, and so a permanent and just punish- 
ment. Pein is the abbreviated second aorist active infini- 
tive of pind for piein (epion). It is the epexegetical infini- 
tive after dedokas. There was no more drinking-water, but 
only this coagulated blood. They are worthy (axioi eisin). 
“Terrible antithesis” (Swete) to 3:4. The asyndeton adds 
to it (Alford). 

7. O Lord God, the Almighty (Kurie ho theos ho pantokrator). 


422 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Just as in 15:3 in the Song of Moses and of the Lamb, 
vocative with the article ho. “Judgments” (kriseis) here 
instead of “ways” (hodoi) there, and with the order of the 
adjectives reversed (aléthinai kai dikaiai, true and righteous). 

8. Upon the sun (epi ton hélion). Not eis (into) as in 
verses 2, 3, 4. The fourth trumpet (8:12) affected a third 
of the sun, moon, and stars with a plague of darkness, but 
here it is a plague of extreme heat. To scorch with fire 
(kaumatisai en puri). First aorist active infinitive of kau- 
matizo, late (Plutarch, Epictetus) causative verb (from 
kauma, heat), in N.T. only here and verse 9, Matt. 1 3:6; 
Mark 4:6. The addition of en puri (in fire, with fire) in- 
tensifies the picture. 

9. Were scorched (ekaumatisthésan). First aorist passive 
indicative of same verb. With great heat (kauma mega). 
Cognate accusative retained with the passive verb. Old 
word (from kaid to burn), in N.T. only 7:16 and here. For 
blaspheming the name of God see 13:6; James 2:7; Rom. 
2:24; I Tim. 6:1. They blamed God for the plagues. They 
repented not (ou metenoésan). This solemn negative aorist 
of metanoed is a refrain like a funeral dirge (9:20f.; 16:11). 
In 11:13 some did repent because of the earthquake. Even 
deserved punishment may harden the heart. To give him 
glory (dounai autoi doxan). Second aorist active infinitive 
of didomi, almost result. For the phrase see 11:13; 14:7; 
19:7. 

10. Upon the throne of the beast (epi ton thronon iou 
theriou). ‘That is Rome (13:2). The dragon gave the beast 
his throne (2:13). Was darkened (egeneto eskotomené). Peri- 
phrastic past perfect passive with ginomai and skotoa (9:2). 
Like the darkness of the Egyptian plague (Ex. 10:22) and 
worse, for the effects of the previous plagues continue. 
They gnawed their tongues (emasonto tas glossas auton). Im- 
perfect middle of masaomai, old verb (to chew), from maa 
(to knead), only here in N.T. For pain (ek tou ponon). 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 423 


“Out of distress” (cf. ek in 8:13), rare sense of old word 
(from penomai to work for one’s living), in N.T. only here, 
ania? Colig 197° See: Matt. '8:12. 

11. They blasphemed (eblasphemésan) and they repented not 
(kai ou metenoésan): Precisely as in verse 9, which see. 
Not just because of the supernatural darkness, but also 
“because of their pains” (ek ton pondn auton, plural here 
and same use of ek) and their sores (kai ek ton helkin auton, 
as in verse 2, only plural, and same use of ek). Of their 
works (ek ton ergon auton). “Out of their deeds,” and ad- 
dition to verse 9. The God of heaven (ton theon tou ouranou). 
As in Dan. 2:44. Like the pride of Nebuchadrezzar against 
Jehovah. 

12. Upon the great river, the river Euphrates (epi ton 
potamon ton megan ton Euphratén). The sixth trumpet 
brings up the river Euphrates also (9:14), only there eps 
with the locative, while here epi with the accusative. Note 
triple use of the article ton here. Was dried up (exéranthé). 
First aorist (prophetic) passive of xéraind (14:15). Cf. 
Zech. 10:11. That may be made ready (hina hetoimasthéi). 
Purpose clause with Aina and the first aorist passive of 
hetoimazo. Common verb in Rev. (8:6; 9:7, 15; 12:6; 19:7; 
21:2). The way for the kings (hé hodos ton basiledn). Objec- 
tive genitive dasiledn. That come from the sunrising (ton 
apo anatolés héliou). “Those from the rising of the sun,” 
the kings from the east (cf. Matt. 2:2) in their march against 
Rome. Parthia in particular resisted Rome before Trajan’s 
day. 

i Coming out of (ek alone, no participle erchomena). 
Of the dragon (tou drakontos). That is Satan (12:3, 9). Of 
the beast (tou thériou). The first beast (13:1, 12) and then 
just “the beast” (13:14ff.; 14:9, 11; 15:2; 16:2, 10), “the 
brute force of the World-power represented by the Roman 
Empire” (Swete). Of the false prophet (tou pseudoprophétou). 
Cf. Matt. 7:15; Acts 13:6; I John 2:22; 4:3; II John 7. 


424 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Identified with the second beast (13:11-14) in 19:20; 20:10. 
So the sixth bowl introduces the dragon and his two sub- 
alterns of chapters 12 and 13 (the two beasts). Three un- 
clean spirits (pneumata tria akatharta). Out of the mouths 
of each of the three evil powers (the dragon and the two 
beasts) comes an evil spirit. See the use of mouth in 1:16 
(g:17f.; 11:5; 12:15; 19:15, 21) as a chief seat of influence. 
In II Thess. 2:8 we have ‘“‘the breath of his mouth” (the 
other sense of pneuma). For akatharton (unclean) with 
pneuma see Mark 1:23f.; 3:115 5:2ff.; Acts 5:16; 8:7. “Christ 
expelled unclean spirits, but His enemies send them forth” 
(Swete). See Zech. 13:2 “the false prophets and the un- 
clean spirits.” 4s it were frogs (his batrachoi). Cf. Ex. 
8:5; Lev. 11:10ff. Old word, here alone in N.T. Like 
loathsome frogs in form. 

14. Spirits of devils (pneumata daimonion). “Spirits of 
demons.” Explanation of the simile Ads batrachoi. See I 
Tim. 4:1 about “deceiving spirits and teachings of demons.” 
Working signs (poiounta sémeia). ‘Doing signs” (present 
active participle of poied). The Egyptian magicians wrought 
“signs” (tricks), as did Simon Magus and later Apollonius 
of Tyana. Houdini claimed that he could reproduce every 
trick of the spiritualistic mediums. Which go forth (ha 
ekporeuetai). Singular verb with neuter plural (collective) 
subject. Unto the kings (epi tous basileis). The three evil 
spirits (dragon and the two beasts) spur on the kings of the ~ 
whole world to a real world war. “There have been times 
when nations have been seized by a passion for war which 
the historian can but imperfectly explain” (Swete). To 
gather them together (sunagagein). Second aorist active in- 
finitive of sunagd, to express purpose (that of the unclean 
spirits). Unto the war of the great day of God, the Almighty 
(eis ton polemon tés hémeras tes megalés tou theou tou panto- 
kratoros). Some take this to be war between nations, like 
Mark 13:8, but it is more likely war against God (Ps. 2:2) 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 425 


and probably the battle pictured in 17:14 and 19:19. Cf. 
II Pet. 3:12, “the day of God,” his reckoning with the na- 
tions. See Joel 2:11; 3:4. -Paul uses “‘that day” for the 
day of the Lord Jesus (the Parousia) as in I Thess. 5:2; 
[ivPhessien:t0;9030; 1 Corier:8311[:Cors 1:14; Phil. 1:6; 2216; 
II Tim. 1:12, 18; 4:8. 

15. Behold, I come as a thief (idou erchomai hos kleptes). 
The voice of Christ breaks in with the same metaphor as 
in 3:3, which see. There comes one of seven beatitudes in 
Rey. (1:3; 14:13; 16:15; 19:9; 20:6; 22:7, 14). For grégoron 
(watching) see 3:2, and for séron (keeping), 1:3. Lest he 
walk naked (hina mé gumnos peripatéi). Negative purpose: 
clause with hina mé and the present active subjunctive of 
peripated, and note predicate nominative gumnos (naked). 
And they see his shame (kai bleposin tén aschemosunén autou). 
Continuation of the final clause with present active sub- 
junctive of blepd. Aschémosunén is old word (from aschémon, 
indecent, I Cor. 12:23), in N.T. only here and Rom. 1:27, 
a euphemism for sén aischunéen (Rev. 3:18). 

16. They gathered (sunégagen). Second aorist active in- 
dicative of sunagd, singular (the three unclean spirits), like 
ekporeuetai in verse 14. Har-Magedon (Har-Magedon). John 
proceeds now after the interruption in verse 15. Perhaps 
“the mountains of Megiddo” though not certain. Megiddo 
is in the valley of Esdraelon, and by the waters of Megiddo 
(the Kishon) Israel gained a decisive victory over Sisera 
(Judges 5:19), celebrated in Deborah’s song. See also Rev. 
20:8ff. and Ezek. 39:2, 4. 

17. Upon the air (epi ton aera). All men breathe the air 
and this is worse than the smiting of the earth (verse 2), 
the sea (3), the fresh waters (4), the sun (8). 4 great voice 
(phoné megalé). The voice of God as in 16:1. I¢ is done 
(Gegonen). Perfect active indicative of ginomai. Like 
Gegonan in 21:6. The whole series of plagues is now com- 
plete. 


426 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


18. And there were (kai egenonto). “And there came” 
(same verb ginomai). See 8:5; 11:19 for this list of terrible 
sounds and lightnings, and for the great earthquake (seismos 
megas) see 6:12; 11:13 (cf. Luke 21:11). Such as was not 
(hoios ouk egeneto). Qualitative relative with ginomai again, 
“such as came not.” Since there were men (aph’ hou an- 
thropoi egenonto). “Since which time (chronou understood) 
men came.” So great an earthquake, so mighty (télikoutos 
seismos houto megas). Quantitative correlative télikoutos 
rather than the qualitative toioutos, to correspond with 
hoios (not hosos). And then houtd megas repeats (redundant) 
telikoutos. Cf. Mark 13:19 for hoia—toiaut@ about like 
tribulation (thlipsis). 

19. Was divided into three parts (egeneto eis tria meré). 
“Came into three parts” (gizomai again). In 11:3 a tenth 
part of the city fell. Babylon (Rome) is meant (17:18). 
Fell (epesan). Second aorist active indicative of pipta (-an 
form in place of -on). Was remembered (emnésthé). First 
aorist (prophetic) passive indicative of mimnéskd. Babylon 
(Rome) had not been overlooked. God was simply biding 
his time with Rome. To give unto her (dounai autét). 
Second aorist active infinitive of diddmi, epexegetic use as 
in 11:18; 16:9. The cup of the wine of the fierceness of his 
wrath (to potérion tou oinou tou thumou tés orgés autou). 
“The cup of the wine of the wrath of his anger,” using both 
thumos (boiling rage) and orgé (settled anger). See both in 
Jer. 37 (30): 24. ) 

20. Filed (ephugen). Second aorist active indicative of 
pheugo. Islands sometimes sink in the sea in earthquakes 
(6:14). Were not found (ouch heurethésan). . First aorist 
passive indicative of heuriskd. See 20:11 for the same idea. 

21. Hail (chalaza). As in 8:17; 11:19. Every stone about 
the weight of a talent (hos talantiaia). Old adjective (from 
talanton), here only in N.T., but in Polybius and Josephus. 
See Ex. 9:24 for the great hail in Egypt and also Josh. 10:11; 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 427 
Is. 28:2; Ezek. 38:22 for hail as the symbol of God’s wrath. 
In the LXX a ¢alanton ranged in weight from 108 to 130 
pounds. Because of the plague of hail (ek tes plégés tes 
chalazes). “As a result of the plague of hail.” This punish- 
ment had the same effect as in verses 9 and 11. Exceeding 
great (Megale—sphrodra). Emphatic positions at ends of 
the clause (great—exceedingly). 


CHAPTER XVII 


1. I will show thee (deixé soi). Future active of deiknumi. 
It is fitting that one of the seven angels that had the seven 
bowls should explain the judgment on Babylon (16:19) al- 
ready pronounced (14:8). That is now done in chapters 
17 and 18. The judgment of the great harlot (to krima tés 
pornés tés megalés). The word krima is the one used about 
the doom of Babylon in Jer. 28(51):9. Already in 14:8 
Babylon is called the harlot. Pornés is the objective geni- 
tive, “the judgment on the great harlot.” That sitteth upon 
many waters (tes kathémenés epi hudaton pollon). Note triple 
use of the article /és. In Jer. 28(51):13 we have eph’ hudasi 
pollois (locative in piace of genitive as here). Babylon got 
its wealth by means of the Euphrates and the numerous 
canals for irrigation. Rome does not have such a system 
of canals, but this item is taken and applied to the New 
Babylon in 17:15. Nahum (3:4) calls Nineveh a harlot, 
as Isaiah (23:16f.) does Tyre. 

2. The kings of the earth (hoi basileis tés gés). Repeated 
in 1:5; 6:15; 17:18; 18:3, 9; 19:19; 21:24 and “the kings 
of the inhabited earth” (16:14) either for human rulers in 
general or the vassal kings absorbed by the Roman Empire. 
Committed fornication (eporneusan). First aorist active in- 
dicative of porneud. “In purchasing the favour of Rome 
by accepting her suzerainty and with it her vices and idola- 
tries” (Swete). Were made drunken (emethusthésan). First 
aorist passive indicative of methuskd, old verb (from methu), 
as in Luke 12:45, here only in the Apocalypse. Cf. Is. 
51:7 and pepotiken in Rev. 14:8. See 18:3. 

3. He carried me away (apénegken me). Second aorist ac- 
tive indicative of apopherd, to bear away, prophetic aorist. 

428 ; 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 429 


This verb is used of angels at death (Luke 16:22) or in an 
ecstasy (Rev. 21:10 and here). In the Spirit (en pneumati). 
Probably his own spirit, though the Holy Spirit is possible 
(1:10; 4:2; 21:10), without Paul’s uncertainty (II Cor. 12:2). 
Cf. Ezek. 3:14f.; 8:3; 11:24. Into a wilderness (eis erémon). 
In Is. 21 there is to horama tés eremou (the vision of the 
deserted one, Babylon), and in Is. 14:23 Babylon is called 
eremon. John may here picture this to be the fate of Rome 
or it may be that he himself, in the wilderness (desert) this 
side of Babylon, sees her fate. In 21:10 he sees the New 
Jerusalem from a high mountain. Sitting (kathémenén). 
Present middle participle of kath@mai as in verse 1. “To. 
manage and guide the beast” (Vincent). Upon a scarlet- 
coloured beast (epi therion kokkinon). Accusative with epi 
here, though genitive in verse 1. Late adjective (from 
kokkos, a parasite of the ilex coccifera), a crimson tint for 
splendour, in Rev. 17:3, 4; 18:12, 16 and Matt. 27:28; Heb. 
g:19. Full of names of blasphemy (gemonta onomata blas- 
phemias). See 13:1 for “names of blasphemy” on the seven 
heads of the beast, but here they cover the whole body of 
the beast (the first beast of 13:1; 19:20). The harlot city 
(Rome) sits astride this beast with seven heads and ten 
horns (Roman world power). The beast is here personified 
with masculine participles instead of neuter, like thérion 
(gemonta accusative singular, echon nominative singular, 
though some MSS. read echonta), construction according 
to sense in both instances. The verb gemé always has the 
genitive after it in the Apocalypse (4:6, 8; 5:8; 15:73 17:45 
21:9) save here and apparently once in 17:4. 

4. Was arrayed (én peribeblémené). Periphrastic past per- 
fect indicative of periballd, to fling round one. In purple 
and scarlet (porphuroun kai kokkinon). Accusative retained 
after this passive verb of clothing, as so often. Porphurous 
is old adjective for purple (from porphura), in N.T. only 
here and John 19:2, 5. See preceding verse for kokkinos. 


430 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


Decked (kechrusoOmené). Perfect passive participle of chrusod, 
old verb, to gild, to adorn with gold, here alone in N.T. 
With gold and precious stone and pearls (chrusioi kai lithoi 
timioi kai margaritais). Instrumental case. Chrusidi is 
cognate with the participle. Lithdi timidi is collective 
(18:12, 16; 21:19). There is a zeugma also with margaritais 
(18:12, 16; 21:21), for which word see Matt. 7:6. Probably 
John is thinking of the finery of the temple prostitutes in 
Asia Minor. Full of abominations (gemon bdelugmatin). 
Agreeing with potérion, “cup” (neuter singular accusative). 
Some MSS. read gemén (nominative masculine like echon 
in verse 3, quite irregular). For ddelugmaton (genitive after 
gemon) see Matt. 24:15; (Mark 13:14), common in the LXX 
for idol worship and its defilements (from ddelussd, to render 
foul), both ceremonial and moral. See Jer. 15:7. Even the 
unclean things of her fornication (kai ta akatharta tés porneias 
auiés). Hither the accusative after gemon as in verse 3 
(and full of the unclean things of her fornication) or the 
object of echousa, like potérion. 

5. Upon her forehead a name written (epi to metipon autes 
onoma gegrammenon). Roman harlots wore a label with 
their names on their brows (Seneca, Rhet. I. 2. 7; Juvenal 
VI. 122f.), and so here. In 19:16 Christ has a name on 
his garments and on his thigh, while in 14:1 and 22:4 the 
redeemed have the name of God on their foreheads. There 
is undoubtedly a contrast between this woman here and . 
the woman in chapter 12. Mystery (mustérion). Either in 
apposition with onoma or as part of the inscription on her 
forehead. In either case the meaning is the same, that the 
name Babylon is to be interpreted miystically or spiritually 
(cf. pneumatikos 11:8) for Rome. The Mother of the Harlots 
and of the Abominations of the Earth (H@ Métér ton Pornén 
kai ton Bdelugmaton tés Gés). The Metropolis of the Em- 
pire is the mother of harlotry and of the world’s idolatries. 
Charles quotes Tacitus (4mm. XV. 44) about Rome as the 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 431 


c 


city “guo cuncta undique atrocia aut pudenda confluunt 
celebranturque.” 

6. Drunken with the blood of the saints (methuousan ek 
tou haimatos ton hagion). Present active feminine accusa- 
tive singular participle of methud, old verb, to be drunk 
(Matt. 24:49). Of the martyrs of Fesus (ton marturon Tésou). 
“Witnesses” (2:13) for Jesus (objective genitive) unto blood 
(16:6; 18:24) and so martyrs in the modern sense of the 
word. “Drunk with blood” is a common idea with the 
ancients (Euripides, Josephus, Philo, Cicero, Pliny). With 
@ great wonder (thauma mega). Cognate accusative with 
ethaumasa. 

7. I will tell thee the mystery (eg6 ero soi to mustérion). 
The angel gives his interpretation of the woman and the 
beast (17:7-18). ré is the future active of eipon (defec- 
tive verb), to tell, to say. 

8. Was and is not (én kai ouk estin). Imperfect and present 
of eimi, an apparent antithesis to ho én kai ho on of 1:4. 
This is a picture of the beast of 13:1ff. which the woman is 
riding, but no longer just the empire, but one of the empe- 
rors who died (ouk estin, is not). And is about to come up out 
of the abyss (kai mellei anabainein ek tes abussou). That is, 
he is going to come to life again. nd to go into perdition 
(kai eis apoleian hupagei). So (and he goes into perdition) 
the best MSS. read rather than the infinitive Aupagein. 
Most interpreters see here an allusion to the “‘Nero redi- 
vivus” expectancy realized in Domitian, who was ruling 
when John wrote and who was called Nero redivivus. Shall 
wonder (thaumasthésontai). First future passive (deponent) 
of thaumazo, with which compare ethaumasthé in 13:3. John 
had wondered (ethaumasa) in verse 6 “with the amazement 
of a horrible surprise; the world will wonder and admire” 
(Swete). Whose name (hon onoma). Singular onoma, like 
ptoma in 11:8. See 13:8 for the same description of those 
who worship the beast and for discussion of details. When 


432 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


they behold (bleponton). Genitive plural of the present active 
participle of d/epd, agreeing with hon (genitive relative) 
rather than with hoi katoikountes (nominative just before 
hon). How that (hoti). “Namely that.” He was, and is not, 
and shall come (én kai ouk estin kai parestai). Repetition 
of what is in verse 7 with parestai (future of pareimi, from 
which parousia comes) in place of mellei, “parody of the 
divine name” (Charles) in 1:4, 8; 4:8, “as the hellish anti- 
type of Christ.”” The Neronic Antichrist has also a parousia. 

9. Here is the mind which hath wisdom (Hode ho nous ho 
echon sophian). “Here is the intelligence which has wisdom” 
(Charles). A variation of 13:18, but the same idea. Seven 
mountains (hepta oré). Rome was known as the city on 
seven hills (Vergil, Horace, Ovid, Cicero, etc.). On which 
(hopou—ep’ auton). ‘‘Where—upon them.” Pleonasm like 
hopou—ekei in 12:6. In 13:1ff. it is the beast that has the 
seven heads, while here the woman riding the beast has 
seven heads, a slight change in the symbolism, and the 
heads. are further identified as kings. 

10. Seven kings (basileis hepta). This is another change 
in the symbolism. The identification of these seven kings 
is one of the puzzles of the book. The five are fallen (hoi 
pente epesan). Second aorist active indicative of piptd with 
the -an ending. Common for the downfall of kings (Ezek. 
29:5; 30:6; Is. 21:9, etc.). See II Sam. 3:38. The one is 
(ho heis estin). The one when this vision is dated. The. 
other is not yet come (ho allos oupé élthen). Prophetic second 
aorist active of erchomai. Charles takes this as the date of 
this “‘source” or part of the Apocalypse. But John could 
himself have used this language in the time of Domitian 
even if he was the one who had not yet come. The difficulty 
about counting these emperors is that Galba, Otho, Vitellius 
reigned so briefly that they hardly merit being included. 
When he cometh (hotan elthéi). Indefinite temporal clause 
for the future, with Aotan and the second aorist active sub- 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 433 


junctive of erchomai, “whenever he comes.” He must con- 
tinue a little while (oligon auton dei meinai). Swete takes this 
to be Titus, who died September 13, 81, after a short reign. 

11. Ls himself also an eighth and is of the seven (kai autos 
ogdoos kai ek ton hepta). This is the angel’s interpretation 
and it looks like a reference to Domitian as the eighth, whe 
is regarded as one of the seven because he was considered a 
second Nero (Nero redivivus). For ek tin hepta see Acts 21:8. 
John may have used ek ¢dn instead of heis ek tin to avoid 
absolute identity between Domitian and Nero (Beckwith). 
And he goeth unto perdition (kai eis apoleian hupagei). As 
in verse 8. “Domitian was assassinated (September 18, 96), - 
after a terrible struggle with his murderers. The tyrant’s 
end was a symbol of the end to which the Beast which he 
personated was hastening” (Swete). Cf. 19:11-21. 

12. Which have received no kingdom as yet (hoitines basi- 
leian oupod elabon). Second aorist (proleptic and prophetic) 
active indicative of Jamband. The heads are emperors and 
the horns are kings (both called dasileis). As kings (hos 
basileis). Compared to kings (see Ads in 1:10; 4:63 9:73 13:33 
14:3; 16:21) without identification with the emperors, though 
succeeding them with ‘“‘quasi-imperial powers” with the 
beast. For one hour (mian horan). Accusative of extent of 
time, and that a brief time (18:10, 16, 19) in comparison 
with the beast (13:2). 

13. Have one mind (mian gnomén echousin). ‘‘One pur- 
pose” (gnomé from gindsko) as in Acts 20:3 and I Cor. 1:10. 
The new powers are allies of the beast. They give their power 
and authority unto the beast (ten dunamin kai ten exousian 
auton toi théridi didoasin). Present active indicative of 
didomi. Just as the dragon gave both power and authority 
to the beast (13:2), so they are wholly at the service of the 
beast. 

14. These (houtoi). These ten kings. Shall war against 
the Lamb (meta tou thériou polemésousin). Future active of 


434 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


polemeo, to war. As allies of the beast (the servant of the 
dragon, 12:7) they will wage war with the Lamb (the enemy 
of the dragon). These kings gather for battle as in 16:13f. 
And the Lamb shall overcome them (kai to arnion nikéset 
autous). Future active of nikad. This is the glorious out- 
come, victory by the Lamb over the coalition of kings as 
against the beast before. For he is Lord of lords and King 
of kings (hoti Kurios kurion estin kai Basileus basileon). 
The same words are again descriptive of Christ in 19:16, 
as of God in Deut. 10:17 (God of gods and Lord of lords) 
and Dan. 10:17 (God of gods and Lord of kings). Cf. also 
I Tim. 6:15 and Rev. 1:5. Crowned heads are Christ’s 
subjects. And they also shall overcome that are with him 
(kai hoi met’ autou). ‘And those with him shall also over- 
come” (supply nikésousin, not eisin). They will share in 
the triumph of the Lamb, as they shared in the conflict. 
Cf. meta tou thériou in verse 12. Called and chosen and faith- 
ful (klétoi kai eklektoi kai pistoi). ‘These are the three notes 
of those who share in the victory. For k/étos and eklektos 
see Matt. 22:14 (contrasted); Rom. 8:28ff.; II Pet. 1:10; 
Rev. 2:10, 13. The elect are called and prove faithful. 

15. Where the harlot sitteth (hou hé pornos kathétai). Rela- 
tive adverb hou (where) referring to the waters (Audata) of 
verse 1 on which the harlot sits. Present middle indicative 
of kathémai. Are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and 
tongues (laoi kai ochloi eisin kai ethné kai glossai). The 
O.T. uses “waters” as symbol for “peoples”’ (Is. 8:7; Jer. 
47:2; Ps. 29:10, etc.). “Rome’s greatest danger lay in the 
multitudes which were under her sway” (Swete). 

16. These shall hate the harlot (houtoi misésousin tén por- 
nén). Future active of mised. Houtoi is resumptive dem- 
onstrative pronoun (masculine) referring to the ten horns 
and the beast (neuter); construction according to sense. 
The downfall of Rome will come from the sudden change 
in subject peoples. Shall make her desolate and naked 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 435 


(2rémomenén poiesousin autén kai gumnén). Future active 
of poied and perfect passive predicate accusative participle 
of erémod, old verb (from erémos desolate), again in 18:16, 
19. Gumnén (naked) is predicate adjective. Shall eat her 
flesh (tas sarkas autés phagontai). Future middle of the de- 
fective verb esthid, to eat. Note plural sarkas, portions of 
flesh (James 5:3) as in Ps. 27:2 and Mic. 3:3. Shall burn 
her utterly with fire (autén katakausousin en puri). Future 
active of katakaid, to burn down (perfective use of aid). 
John wrote before the days of Alaric, Genseric, Ricimer, 
Totila, with their hordes which devastated Rome and the 


west in the fifth and sixth centuries. ‘‘No reader of the © 


Decline and Fall can be at a loss for materials which will 
at once illustrate and justify the general trend of St. John’s 
prophecy” (Swete). 

17. Did put (edoken). “Did give” (first aorist active of 
didomi. To do his mind (poiésai tén gnomén autou). Ep- 
exegetic first aorist active infinitive of poied after eddken, as 
often in this book. They are of one mind (verse 13) be- 
cause God put them up to it, clear statement of God’s over- 
ruling hand among the nations. Until the words of God should 
be accomplished (achri telesthesontai hoi logot tou theou). 
Temporal clause about the future with achri (like heos), 
with the future indicative of ¢e/ed, but with aorist passive 
subjunctive ¢elesthdsin in 15:8. For teled see also 10:7. For 
“the words of God”’ see 19:9. They will be fulfilled. 

18. The woman (hé gunz). She is now explained after 
the beast has been interpreted. Verse g made it plain 
enough, but this verse demonstrates that the woman is the 
city of Rome “which reigneth (hé echousa basileian, the one 
having a kingdom) over the kings of the earth (epi ton 
basilein tés gés).” Rome followed Babylon, and other cities 
may follow in their train. 


CHAPTER XVIII 


1. Coming down out of heaven (katabainonta ek tou ouranou). 
Present active predicate participle. Not the angel of 17:1, 
7, 15 (John’s guide), but one announcing the doom of Baby- 
lon (Rome). As in 10:1; 20:1. Was lightened (ephotisthé). 
First aorist passive of phdtizd, old causative verb (from 
phos, light), common in N.T. as in Rev. 18:1; 21:23; 22:5. 
With his glory (ek tés doxés autou). ‘By reason of (ek as in 
8:13; 16:10) his glory.” “So recently has he come from 
the Presence that in passing he flings a broad belt of light 
across the dark earth” (Swete). 

2. Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great (epesen, epesen Babu- 
lon hé megalé). The very words of 14:8: “Did fall, did fall 
Babylon the great.” Prophetic aorists of piptd repeated like 
a solemn dirge of the damned. Js become (egeneto). Pro- 
phetic aorist middle. 4 habitation of devils (katoikétérion). 
Late word (from katoiked, to dwell), in N.T. only here and 
Eph. 2:22. Devils should be demons, of course. So Isaiah 
prophesied of Babylon (12:21f.) and also Jeremiah (50:39) 
and Zephaniah of Nineveh (2:14). Both Babylon and Nine- 
veh are ruins. 4 hold of every unclean spirit (phulaké pantos 
pneumatos akathartou). Phulaké is garrison or watch-tower 
as in Hab. 2:1, rather than a prison (20:7). 2 hold of every 
unclean and hateful bird (phulaké pantos orneou akathartou 
kai memisémenou). Orneou is old word for bird, in N.T. 
only Rev. 18:2; 19:17, 21. ““The evil spirits, watching over 
fallen Rome like night-birds or harpies that wait for their 
prey, build their eyries in the broken towers which rise from 
the ashes of the city” (Swete). Long ago true of Babylon 
and Nineveh, some day to be true of Rome. 

3. By (ek). “As a result of.” Some MSS. omit ‘of the 

436 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 437 


wine” (fou oinou). Cf. 14:10; 16:10. Have fallen (peptokan). 
Perfect active third personal of pipfd for usual peptokasi. 
Some MSS. read pepdkan (have drunk), from pino like the 
metaphor in 14:8, 10; 16:19; 17:2. See 17:2 for the same 
charge about the kings of the earth. The merchants of the 
earth (hoi emporoi tés gés). Old word for one on a journey 
for trade (from en, poros), like drummers, in N.T. only 
Matt. 13:45; Rev. 18:3, 11, 15, 23. Like emporion (John 
2:16) and emporeuomai (James 4:13). Waxed rich (eplou: 
tesan). First ingressive aorist active indicative of plouted, 
to be rich (cf. 3:17). Here alone in the N.T. do we catch 
a glimpse of the vast traffic between east and west that made 
Rome rich. Of her wantonness (tou strénous autés). Late 
word for arrogance, luxury, here alone in N.T. See stréniaé 
in verses 7 and g, to live wantonly. 

4. Come forth, my people, out of her (exelthate, ho laos mou, 
ex autes). Second aorist (urgency) active imperative (-a 
form) of exerchomai. Like Is. 48:20; 52:11; Jer. 50:8; 51:6 
(about Babylon). See also the call of Abram (Gen. 12:1), 
the rescue of Lot (Gen. 19:12ff.). In the N.T. see Mark 
13:4; Il Cor. 6:14; Eph. 5:11; I Tim. 5:11. Ho Jaos is voca- 
tive with the form of the nominative. That ye have no 
Sellowship with her sins (hina mé sunkoinonéséte tais hamar- 
tais autés). Purpose clause with hina mé and the first aorist 
active subjunctive of sunkoindned, old compound (sun, to- 
gether, koindnos, partner), in N.T. only here, Phil. 4:14; 
Eph. 5:11. With associative instrumental case hamartiais. 
And that ye receive not of her plagues (kai ek ton plegon autés 
hina mé labéte). Another purpose clause dependent on the 
preceding, with hina mé and the second aorist active sub- 
junctive of /amband, and with proleptic emphatic position of 
ek ton plégon autes before hina mé. 

5. Have reached (ekolléthésan). First aorist passive (de- 
ponent) indicative of kollad, old verb (from kolla, gluten, 
glue), to cleave to, to join one another in a mass “up to 


438 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


heaven” (achri tou ouranou). Cf. Jer. 51:9; Zech. 14:5. 
Hath remembered (emnémoneusen). First aorist (prophetic) 
active indicative of mnémoneud, here with the accusative 
(adikémata, iniquities) instead of the genitive (Col. 4:18). 

6. Render as she rendered (apodote his apediken). Second 
aorist (effective) active imperative and first aorist (effective) 
active of apodidémi, old and common verb for requital, to 
give back, the /ex talionis which is in the O.T. (Jer. 50:15, 
29; 51:24, 56; Ps. 137:8), and in the N.T. also (Matt. 7:2). 
Here the reference is to persecutions by Rome, particularly 
the martyrdom of the saints (18:24; 19:2). Double the double 
(diplosate ta dipla). First aorist imperative of diplod, old 
verb (from diploos, double, Matt. 23:15), here only in N.T. 
Dipla is simply the neuter plural accusative (cognate) con- 
tract form for diploa (not diplo). Requite here in double 
measure, a ful] requital (Ex. 22:4, 7, 9; Is. 40:2; Jer. 16:18; 
17:18; Zech. 9:12). The double recompense was according 
to the Levitical law. Which she mingled (hoi ekerasen). 
First aorist active indicative of kerannumi. The relative 
hoi is attracted to the locative case of its antecedent poteri6i 
(cup), for which see 14:8, 10; 17:4; 18:3. Mingle unto her 
double (kerasate autéi diploun). First aorist active impera- 
tive of the same verb kerannumi, with the same idea of 
double punishment. 

7. How much soever (hosa). Indefinite quantitative rela- 
tive pronoun /osos in the accusative (cognate) neuter plural ° 
object of edoxasen (first aorist active indicative of doxaz0). 
Herself (hautén). Reflexive pronoun, accusative also with 
edoxasen. Waxed wanton (estréniasen). First aorist (ingres- 
sive) active indicative of stréniad (to live luxuriously), verb 
in late comedy instead of truphad (James 5:5), from strénos 
(Rev. 18:3), only here in N.T. So much give her of torment 
and mourning (tosouton dote autéi basanismon kai penthos). 
Second aorist active imperative of didomi, to give. The cor- 
relative pronoun fosouton is masculine singular accusative, 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 439 


agreeing with dasanismon, for which see 9:5 and 14:11, and 
is understood with the neuter word penthos (mourning), in 
N.T. only in James 4:9; Rev. 18:7ff.; 21:4 (kin to pathos, 
penomat). I sit a queen (kathémai basilissa). Predicate nom- 
inative for the old form basileia (dasilis), as in Matt. 12:42. 
Babylon and Tyre had preceded Rome in such boasting (Is. 
4777-9; Ezek. 27:3; 28:2; Zeph. 2:15). And am no widow 
(kai chéra ouk eimi). Feminine of the adjective chéros (bar- 
ren), old word (Mark 12:40). Shall in no wise see mourning 
(penthos ou mé ido). Confident boast of security with em- 
phatic position of penthos (see above) and double negative 
ou mé with the second aorist active subjunctive of horad 
(defective verb). 

8. Therefore (dia touto). Because of her presumption 
added to her crimes. In one day (en miai hémerai). Sym- 
bolical term for suddenness like midi hérai, in one hour 
(18:10, 16, 19). John has in mind still Is. 47:7-9. Shall 
come (hexousin). Future active of A2kd. Her plagues are 
named (death, mourning, famine). She shall be utterly 
burned (katakauthésetai). Future passive of katakaio (per- 
fective use of kata). With fire (en puri). “In fire,” as in 
17:16. Which judged her (ho krinas autén). Articular first 
aorist active participle of krind referring to kurios ho theos 
(the Lord God). The doom of Babylon is certain because 
of the power of God. 

g. Shall weep (klausousin). Future active of klaid, mid- 
dle k/ausontai in Attic, as in John 16:20. And wail over her 
(kai kopsontai ep’ autén). Future direct middle of kopto, 
old verb, to beat, to cut, middle to beat oneself (Rev. 1:7). 
For combination with k/aid as here see Luke 8:52. See 
17:2; 18:3, 7 for hoi porneusantes kai stréniasantes). When 
they look upon (hotan bleposin). Indefinite temporal clause 
with hotan and the present active subjunctive of dlepa. 
The smoke of her burning (ton kapnon tés puroseds autes). 
Purosis is an old word (from purod to burn), in N.T. only 


440 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


I Pet. 4:12; Rev. 18:9, 18. See verse 8 for other plagues 
on Rome, but fire seems to be the worst (17:16; 18:8, 9, 
1i7$.1933)s 

10. Standing afar off (apo makrothen hestékotes). Perfect 
active (intransitive) participle of Aistémi. Vivid picture of 
the terrible scene, fascinated by the lurid blaze (cf. Nero’s 
delight in the burning of Rome in a.p. 64), and yet afraid 
to draw near. On apo makrothen see Mark 5:6. There is 
a weird charm in a burning city. They feared the same fate 
(cf. verse 7 for dasanismou, torment). W oe, woe, the great 
city (ouai, ouai, hé polis hé megal@). Only example in the 
Apocalypse of the nominative with ouai except verses 16, 
19, though in Luke 6:25 and common in LXX (ls. §:7, 11, 
etc.). For the dative see Rev. 8:13, once so “strong” (hé 
ischura)! In one hour (midi horai). Repeated in verses 
16, 19, and like midi hémerdi (in one day) in verse 8. Some 
MSS. have here mian horan, like poian horan (accusative of 
extent of time) in 3:3. See verse 8 (ho krinas) for hé krisis 
sou (thy judgment). This is the dirge of the kings. 

11. The merchants (hoi emporoi). As in 18:3, 15, 23. The 
dirge of the merchants follows the wail of the kings. Weep 
and mourn (klaiousin kai penthousin). Present active in- 
dicatives of k/aid and penthed as in verses g (for k/aio), 15, 
19. For no man buyeth their merchandise any more (hoti ton 
gomon auton oudeis agorazei ouketi). Reason enough for 
their sorrow over Rome’s fall. Gomos is old word (from: 
gemo to be full) for a ship’s cargo (Acts 21:3) and then any 
merchandise (Rev. 18:11f.). Galen, Pliny, Aristides tell of 
the vastness of the commerce and luxury of Rome, the 
world’s chief market. Many of the items here are like those 
in the picture of the destruction of Tyre in Ezek. 26 and 
27. There are twenty-nine items singled out in verses 12 
and 13 of this merchandise or cargo (gomon), imports into 
the port of Rome. Only a few need any comment. 

12. Of fine linen (bussinou). Genitive case after gomon, 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 441 


as are all the items to kokkinou. Old adjective from dussos 
(linen, Luke 16:19), here a garment of linen, in N.T. only 
Rev. 18:12, 16; 19:8, 14. Purple (porphuras). Fabric col- 
ored with purple dye (porphureos, 17:4; 18:16), as in Mark 
1§:17, 20; Luke 16:19. Silk (sirikou). So the uncials here. 
To sérikon (the silken fabric) occurs in Plutarch, Strabo, 
Arrian, Lucian, only here in N.T. Probably from the name 
of the Indian or Chinese people (hoi Séres) from whom the 
fabric came after Alexander invaded India. Silk was a 
costly article among the Romans, and for women as a rule. 
Scarlet (kokkinou). See 17:4 and 18:16. All thyine wood | 
(pan xulon thuinon). Now accusative again without gomon 
dependence. An odoriferous North African citrus tree, 
prized for the colouring of the wood for dining-tables, like 
a peacock’s tail or the stripes of a tiger or panther. Here 
only in N.T. Of ivory (elephantinon). Old adjective (from 
elephas elephant) agreeing with skeuos (vessel), here only 
in N.T. Cf. Ahab’s ivory palace (I Kings 22:39). Of mar- 
ble (marmarou). Old word (from marmairé, to glisten), 
genitive after skeuos (vessel), here only in N.T. 

13. Cinnamon (kinnamomon). Old word transliterated 
into English, here only in N.T. Of Phcenician origin (Hero- 
dotus) as to name and possibly from South China. Spice 
(amomon). A fragrant plant of India, amomum, for per- 
fume. Incense (thumiamata). See 5:8; 8:3. Ointment 
(muron). See Matt. 26:7. Frankincense (libanon). See 
8:3. Fine flour (semidalin). Old word for finest wheaten 
flour, here only in N.T. Of horses (hippon). Here then is 
a return to the construction of the genitive after gomon in 
verse 12, though not used here, an anomalous genitive con- 
struction (Charles). Of chariots (redon). A Gallic word for 
a vehicle with four wheels, here only in N.T. Of slaves 
(somaton). “Of bodies,” treated as animals or implements, 
like the horses and the chariots (cf. rickshaw men in China). 
This use of sdma for slave occurs in Gen. 34:29; Tob. 10:11 


442 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(somata kai ktené, slaves and cattle); II Macc. 8:11. Souls 
of men (psuchas anthropon). Deissmann (Bible Studies, p. 
160) finds this use of soma for slave in the Egyptian Delta. 
Return to the accusative psuchas. From Numb. 31:35; I 
Chron. 5:21; Ezek. 27:13. ‘This addition is an explanation 
of the use of sdmata for slaves, “human live stock” (Swete), 
but slaves all the same. Perhaps kai here should be ren- 
dered “‘even,”’ not ‘‘and”: “bodies even souls of men.” 
The slave merchant was called sdmatemporos (body mer- 
chant). 

14. The fruits (hé opora). The ripe autumn fruit (Jer. 
40:10, 12). Here only in N.T. Of uncertain etymology 
(possibly opos, sap, Adra, hour, time for juicy sap). See 
Jude 12 for dendra phthinoporinos (autumn trees). Which 
thy soul lusteth after (sou tes epithumias tes psuchés). “Of 
the lusting of thy soul.” Are gone from thee (apélthen apo 
sou). Prophetic aorist active indicative of aperchomai with 
repetition of apo. All things that were dainty and sumptuous 
(panta ta lipara kai ta lampra). “All the dainty and the 
gorgeous things.” Liparos is fram /ipos (grease) and so fat, 
about food (here only in N.T.), while /ampros is bright and 
shining (James 2:2f.), about clothing. dre perished from 
thee (apoleto apo sou). Prophetic second aorist middle in- 
dicative of apollumi (intransitive). Shall find them no more 
at all (ouketi ou mé auta heurésousin). Doubled double 
negative with future active, as emphatic a negation as the 
Greek can make. 

15. Of these things (touton). Listed above in verses 12 to 
14. Who were made rich by her (hoi ploutésantes ap’ autes). 
“Those who grew rich (ingressive aorist active participle of 
plouteo, for which see verses 3 and 13) from her.” Shall 
stand afar off (apo makrothen stesontai). Future middle of 
histemi. Repeating the picture in verse 10. Again in verse 
17. See verse 11 for the two participles k/aiontes kai pen- 
thountes. 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 443 


16. For the Woe see verses 10, 19. For the next clause 
see 17:4 with the addition here of bussinon (18:12). For in 
one hour so great riches is made desolate (hoti midi horai 
eremothé ho tosoutos ploutos). The reason (hoti) for the 
“woe.” First aorist .passive indicative of er@mod, for which 
verb see 17:16 and 18:19. This is the dirge of the merchants. 

17. Shipmaster (kubernétés). Old word (from kubernad, 
to steer), helmsman, sailing-master, in N.T. only here and 
Acts 27:11. Subordinate to the naukléros (supreme com- 
mander). That saileth any whither (ho epi topon pleon). 
“The one sailing to a place.” See Acts 27:2, tous kata ten 
Asian pleontas (those sailing down along Asia). Nestle 
suggests ponton (sea) here for topon (place), but it makes 
sense as it is. Mariners (nautai). Old word (from naus, 
ship), in N.T. only here and Acts 27:27, 30. Gain their 
living by the sea (tén thalassan ergazontai). ‘Work the sea.” 
This idiom is as old as Hesiod for sailors, fishermen, etc. 
See verses 10, 15. 

18. As they looked (blepontes). Present active participle 
of blepd. See hotan bleposin in verse 10. What city is like 
the great city? (tis homoia tei polei tei megaléi;). No polis 
with ¢is, but implied. Associative instrumental case, as 
usual, with homoia. “The eternal city” is eternal no longer. 

19. They cast dust (ebalon choun). Second aorist active 
of dallo. Chous is old word (from ched to pour) for heap of 
earth, dust, in N.T. only here and Mark 6:11. Cf. Ezek. 
27:30; Luke 10:13. This is the dirge of the sea-folk (cf. 
verses 10, 16). By reason of her costliness (ek tés timiotétos 
autes). Occasionally in later literary Greek, though here 
only in N.T. and not in LXX. The same use of timé ap- 
pears in I Pet. 2:7. Common in the papyri as a title like 
“Your Honor” (Moulton and Milligan’s Vocabulary). 

20. Rejoice over her (Euphrainou ep’ autéi). Present mid- 
dle imperative of euphraind, for which verb see 11:10, used 
there of the joy of the wicked over the death of the two 


444 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


witnesses, just the opposite picture to this. “The song of 
doom” (Charles) here seems to be voiced by John himself. 
God hath judged your judgment (ekrinen ho theos to krima). 
First aorist (prophetic) active of krind and cognate accusa- 
tive krima, here a case for trial (Ex. 18:22; I Cor. 6:7), 
not a sentence as in 17:1. God has approved the case of 
heaven. 

a1. A strong angel (heis aggelos ischuros). Here heis=a, 
just an indefinite article, not “one” as a numeral. Took 
up (éren). First aorist active indicative of aird. As it were 
a great millstone (hos mulinon megan). Late adjective, in 
inscriptions, here only in N.T., made of millstone (mu/os, 
Matt. 18:6; Rev. 18:22), while mulikos (Luke 17:2) means 
belonging to a mill. This is not a small millstone turned 
by women (Matt. 24:41), but one requiring an ass to turn 
it (Mark 9:42), and so “a great” one. Cast (ebalen). 
Second aorist active of da/lé, to hurl. With a mighty fall 
(hormémati). Instrumental case (manner) of horméma, a 
rush, old word from hormad, to rush (Matt. 8:32), here only 
in N.T. Shall be cast down (blethésetai). Future (first) pas- 
sive of dallé, the same verb (ebalen), effective punctiliar 
future. Like a bowlder hurled into the sea. Shall be found 
no more at all (ou mé heurethéi eti). Double negative with 
first aorist passive subjunctive of heuriskd. See 9:6 for 
ou mé with the active voice of heuriskd. Already the old 
Babylon was a desert waste (Strabo, XVI. 1073). Pag - 

22. The voice (phoné). Cf. Ezek. 26:13. Or “‘sound” as 
in I Cor. 14:8 with salpigx (trumpet). For this song of 
judgment see Jer. 25:10. Of harpers (kithardidon). Old 
word (from kithara, harp, and didos, singer) as in 14:2. 
Of minstrels (mousikon). Old word (from mousa, music), 
here only in N.T., one playing on musical instruments. Of 
flute-players (aulétén). Old word (from auled, to play on-a 
flute, Matt. 11:17, aulos, flute, I Cor. 14:7), in N.T. only 
here and Matt. 9:23. Of trumpeters (salpiston). Late form 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 445 


for the earlier salpigktés (from salpizo), here only in N.T. 
Shall be heard no more at all (ou mé akousthéi). First aorist 
passive subjunctive of akoud with the double negative as 
below, with phoné mulou (sound of the millstone), and as 
in verse 21 with ou me heurethéi and again with pas technités 
(craftsman). This old word is from techné, art, as here in 
some MSS. (“‘of whatsoever craft,” pasés technés). Tech- 
nités occurs also in this sense in Acts 19:24, 38 and in Heb. 
11:10 of God as the Architect. There is power in this four- 
fold sonorous repetition of ou mé and the subjunctive with 
two more examples in verse 23. 

23. Of a lamp (luchnou). Old word (Matt. Rri¢ ys lapain= 
in Rev. 22:5. Shall shine no more at all (ou mé phaniét). 
Fifth instance in these verses of ou mé with the aorist sub- 
junctive, here the active of phaind as in Rev. 8:12. It is 
not known whether Rome had street lights or not. The 
voice of the bridegroom and of the bride (phoné numphiou kai 
numphés). See John 3:29 and Jer. 7:34; 16:9. “Even the 
occasional flash of the torches carried by bridal processions 
(Matt. 25:1ff.) is seen no more” (Swete). The sixth instance 
of ou mé, in verses 21 to 23, occurs with akousthéi (third in- 
stance of akousthéi, two in verse 22). Were the princes of 
the earth (ésan hoi megistanes tés gés). For megistan see Rev. 
6:15, and Mark 6:21. “Thy merchants were the grandees” 
once, but now these merchant princes are gone. With thy 
sorcery (en tei pharmakiai sou). En (instrumental use) and 
the locative case of pharmakia, old word (from pharmakeud, 
to prepare drugs, from pharmakon, sorcery, Rev. 9:21), in 
N.T. only here and Gal. 5:20 for sorcery and magical arts. 
If one is puzzled over the connection between medicine and 
sorcery as illustrated by this word (our pharmacy), he has 
only to recall quackery today in medicine (patent medicines 
and cure-alls), witch-doctors, professional faith-healers, med- 
icine-men in Africa. True medical science has had a hard 
fight to shake off chicanery and charlatanrv. Were deceived 


446 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(eplanéthésan). First aorist passive indicative of planao. 
These charlatans always find plenty of victims. See Mark 
2 c24x 

24. In her (en autéi). In Rome. Was found (heurethé). 
First aorist passive indicative of heuriskd. See 16:6; 17:6 
for the blood already shed by Rome. Rome “butchered to 
make a Roman holiday” (Dill, Roman Society, p. 242) not 
merely gladiators, but prophets and saints from Nero’s mas- 
sacre A.D. 64 to Domitian and beyond. Of all that have been 
slain (panton ton esphagmenon). Perfect passive articular 
participle genitive plural of sphazé, the verb used of the Lamb 
slain (5:9, 12; 13:8). Cf. Matt. 23:35 about Jerusalem. 


CHAPTER XIX 


1. After these things (meta tauta). Often when a turn 
comes in this book. But Beckwith is probably correct in 
seeing in 19:1—5 the climax of chapter 18. This first voice 
(verses 1 and 2) hds phonén megalén ouchlou pollou (as it 
were great voice of much multitude) is probably the response 
of the angelic host (Rev. 5:11; Heb. 12:22). There is re- 
sponsive singing (grand chorus) as in chapters 4 and i. 
Saying (legonton). Present active participle of /egd, genitive 
plural, though och/ou is genitive singular (collective sub- 
stantive, agreement in sense). Hallelujah (Allélouia). Trans- 
literation of the Hebrew seen often in the Psalms (LXX) 
and in III. Macc. 7:13, in N.T. only in Rev. 19:1, 3, 4, 6. 
It means, “‘Praise ye the Lord.” Fifteen of the Psalms 
begin or end with this word. The Great Hallel (a title for 
“Psalms 104 to 109”’) is sung chiefly at the feasts of the 
passover and tabernacles. This psalm of praise uses lan- 
guage already in 12:10. 

2. For (hoti). Because. The reason for God’s judgments 
is given in 15:3; 16:7. The doom of Babylon seen in 14:7 is 
now realized. For (hoti). Second use of hoti, explaining the 
first. He hath judged (ekrinen). First aorist (prophetic and 
climacteric, effective) active indicative of krind. Which 
(Aétis). The very one which. Did corrupt (ephtheiren). 
This is the terrible fact. First aorist active indicative of 
phtheiro. Cf. 11:18; 14:8; 17:2; 18:3. And he hath avenged 
(kai exedikésen). God has exacted vengeance for the blood 
of his servants from (ek) her. Prophetic aorist again of 
ekdiked with accusative and ek with ablative as in 6:10. 

3: 4 second time (deuteron). Adverbial accusative, a 
heavenly encore. They say (eirékan). Perfect active indica- 

447 


448 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


tive of eipon. “They have said,” not an “aoristic” perfect 
for “‘they say,” but vivid dramatic perfect as in 5:7 and the 
form in -an instead of -asin as in 18:3; 21:6. Goeth up (ana- 
bainei). Linear present active indicative of anabaind, 
“keeps on going up,” “‘a last touch to the description al- 
ready given (18:21ff.) of Babylon’s utter collapse” (Swete). 
The smoke of the city’s ruin (14:11; 18:8f., 18) instead of 
incense (8:4). Cf. Is. 34:9f. 

4. Fell down and worshipped God (epesan kai prosekunésan 
toi thedi). Precisely as in 7:11, which see. The twenty-four 
elders and the four living creatures take up the antiphonal 
chorus of the angels. 

5. A voice from the throne (phoné apo tou thronou). Not 
the voice of God, nor of the Lamb, nor ek tou naou (16:17), 
but from an angel of the Presence. This angel summons all 
the servants of God to join in the antiphonal praise to God. 
Give praise to our God (aineite toi thedi hémon). Present 
active imperative of ained, old verb, with the accusative 
elsewhere in N.T., but here with the dative as occasionally 
in the LXX (I Chron. 16:36, etc.). 

6. As it were the voice (hos phonén). Used here three 
times, as once in verse I: once of a second great multitude 
(ochlou pollou), not of angels as in verse 1, but the innumer- 
able multitude of the redeemed of 7:9; then “of many 
waters” (hudaton pollon) as in 1:15 and 14:2 like “the roar 
of a cataract”’ (Swete); and once more “‘the voice of mighty - 
thunders” (dronton ischuron) as in 6:1 and 10:3ff. Saying 
(legonton). ‘The best attested reading, genitive plural of 
legd, agreeing with och/ou (genitive singular), for roll of the 
waters and the roar of the thunders were not articulate. 
Some MSS. have /egontes (nominative plural) referring also 
to ochlou, though nominative instead of genitive. The fourth 
“Hallelujah” comes from this vast multitude. The Lord 
our God, the Almighty (Kurios, ho theos, ho pantokrator). For 
this designation of God see also 1:8; 4:8; 11:17; 15:3; 16:7, 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 449 


145 19:15; 21:22. Cf. deus et dominus noster used of the 
Roman emperor. Reigneth (ebasileusen). First aorist ac- 
tive of basileud. Probably ingressive prophetic aorist, “God 
became king” in fulness of power on earth with the fall 
of the world power. | 

7. Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad (chairmen kai 
agalliomen). Present active subjunctive (volitive) of chaira 
and agalliad (elsewhere in N.T. in the middle except Luke 
1:47; I Pet. 1:8). For both verbs together see Matt. Rene: 
Let us give (ddmen). Second aorist active subjunctive of 
didomi, but A reads dosomen (future active) and P dosamen. 
If the future indicative is read, the tone is changed from - 
exhortation to declaration (we shall give glory unto him). 
The marriage of the Lamb (ho gamos tou arniou). In the 
O.T. God is the Bridegroom of Israel (Hos. 2:16; Is. 54:6; 
Ezek. 16:7ff.). In the N.T. Christ is the Bridegroom of the 
Kingdom (the universal spiritual church as seen by Paul, 
If Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:25ff., and by John in Rev. 3:20; 19:7, 
9; 21:2, 9; 22:17. In the Gospels Christ appears as the 
Bridegroom (Mark 2:19f.; Matt. 9:15; Luke 5:34f.; John 
3:29). The figure of gamos occurs in Matt. 22:2-14. Three 
metaphors of women appear in the Apocalypse (the Mother 
in chapter 12, the Harlot in 17 to 19, and the Bride of Christ 
here to the end). “The first and third present the Church 
under two different aspects of her life, while the second 
answers to her great rival and enemy” (Swete). Js come 
(é/then). Prophetic aorist, come at last. Made herself ready 
(hétoimasen heautén). First aorist active indicative of hetoi.- 
mazo and the reflexive pronoun. See 22:2 for hétoimasmenén 
hos numphén (prepared as a bride). There is something for 
her to do (I John 3:3; Jude 21; II Cor. 7:1), but the chief 
preparation is the act of Christ (Eph. 5:25ff.). 

8. That she should array herself (hina peribalétai). Sub- 
final object clause subject of edothé (was given to her) with 
hina and the second aorist middle (direct) of periballé to 


450 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


fling around. This bridal dress is a gift from Christ. This 
form, edothé (it was given), occurs some 20 times in this 
book. In fine linen, bright and pure (bussinon lampron 
katharon). See 19:14 for the same raiment on those accom- 
panying “The Word of God” and for the seven angels in 
16:6. See by contrast the garments of the harlot (17:4; 
18:16). For dussinon see 18:16. The righteous acts of the 
saints (ta dikaidmata ton hagion). This is the explanation 
(gar) of the bridal dress and explains why there is work for 
the Bride as well as for Christ (Phil. 2:12f.). See 15:4 for 
dikaioma (also Rom. 5:18). 

9. Write (Grapson). First aorist active imperative of 
graphd as in 1:11; 14:13. The speaker may be the angel 
guide of 17:1. It is another beatitude (makarioi, Blessed) 
like that in 14:13 (fourth of the seven in the book). They 
which are bidden (hoi keklémenoi). Articular perfect passive 
participle of kaled, like Matt. 22:3; Luke 14:17. Cf. Rev. 
17:14. This beatitude reminds us of that in Luke 14:15. 
(Cf. Matt. 8:11; 26:29.) These are true words of God (Houtot 
hoi logoi aléthinoi tou theou eisin). Undoubtedly, but one 
should bear in mind that apocalyptic symbolism “has its 
own methods and laws of interpretation, and by these the 
student must be guided” (Swete). 

10. To worship him (proskunésai autoi). First aorist ac- 
tive infinitive of purpose. John either felt that the angel 
represented God or he was beside himself with excitement . 
over the glorious consummation. He was tempted to wor- 
ship an angel (Col. 2:18). See thou do it not (hora mé). 
Repeated in 22:9. Here there is no verb after mé (ellipse 
of poiéséis touto) as in Mark 1:44; I Thess. 5:15), the aorist 
subjunctive of negative purpose with mé after hora (present 
active imperative of horad), a common enough idiom. ° Fe/- 
low-servant (sundoulos). The angel refuses worship from 
John on this ground. All Christians are sundouloi (fellow- 
servants) as Christ taught (Matt. 18:28ff.; 24:49) and as 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 451 


Paul (Col. 1:7; 4:7) and John (Rev. 6:11) taught. Angels 
are God’s servants also (Heb. 1:4-14). For “the testimony 
of Jesus” see 1:2, 9; 6:9; 12:17; 22:4. Worship God (tii 
thedi proskunéson). And Christ, who is the Son of God 
(5:13f.). The spirit of prophecy (to pneuma tes prophéteias). 
Explanatory use of gar (for) here as in 8. The possession 
of the prophetic spirit shows itself in witness to Jesus. In 
illustration see Mark 1:10; Matt. 3:16; Luke 3:21; John 
Papi; RevitgsnsptOstsi11s193 142175152553) 18:13 19:1; 7-9. 

11. The heaven opened (ton ouranon énedigmenon). Per- 
fect passive participle (triple reduplication) of anoigd. Ac- 
cusative case after eidon. So Ezekiel (1:1) begins his 
prophecy. See also the baptism of Jesus (Matt. 3:16= 
Luke 3:21, but schizomenous in Mark 1:10). Jesus predicted 
the opened heavens to Nathanael (John 1:51). In Rev. 4:1 
a door is opened in heaven, the sanctuary is opened (11:19; 
15:5), angels come out of heaven (10:1; 14:17; 18:1), and 
sounds come from heaven (19:1). Behold, a white horse 
(idou hippos leukos). Nominative case because of idou, not 
eidon. Cf. 6:2 for hippos leukos. The emblem of victory in 
both cases, but the riders are very different. Here it is 
the Messiah who is the Warrior, as is made plain by “‘Faith- 
ful and True”’ (pistos kai alethinos), epithets already applied 
to Christ (1:5; 3:7, 14). Cf. also 22:6. In righteousness he 
doth judge and make war (en dikaiosunéi krinei kai polemei). 
See Is. 11:3ff. The Messiah is both Judge and Warrior, 
but he does both in righteousness (15:3; 16:5, 7; 19:2). 
He passes judgment on the beast (antichrist) and makes 
war on him. Satan had offered Christ a victory of com- 
promise which was rejected. 

12. A flame of fire (phlox puros). As in the opening vision 
of Christ in 1:14 (2:18). Many diadems (diadémata polla). 
A new feature, but the dragon has a diadem on each of his 
seven heads (12:3) and the first beast one upon each of 
his ten horns (13:1). So the victorious Messiah will wear 


452 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


many royal diadems and not mere crowns, because he is 
King of kings (19:16). And he hath (kai echon). Nomina- 
tive active present participle of echd either used absolutely 
as an independent verb (like indicative) or in an anacoluthon, 
though autou (his) is genitive. 4 name written (onoma 
gegrammenon). Perfect passive participle of graphd as in 
2:17 (cf. 3:12). But he himself (ei mé autos). ““Except 
himself” (common ellipsis of the verb after ef mé, “if not”’). 
See 2:17 and 3:12 for the new name there described. See 
14:1 for the name of Christ on the forehead of the 144,000, 
and 17:5 for the name on the forehead of the harlot. This 
word here supplements what Jesus says in Matt. 11:27. 

13. Arrayed (peribeblemenos). Perfect passive participle 
of periballé, to clothe, often in this book. Jn a garment 
(himation). Accusative case after the passive participle 
peribeblémenos. Sprinkled (rerantismenon). Perfect passive 
participle of rantizd, in the predicate accusative case agree- 
ing with Aimation. A Q here read bebammenon (perfect pas- 
sive participle of dapto, to dip). Probably rerantismenon 
(sprinkled) is correct, because the picture comes from Is. 
63:3, where Aquila and Symmachus use rantizd. The use 
of bebammenon (dipped) is a bolder figure and Charles con- 
siders it correct. In either case it is the blood of Christ’s 
enemies with which his raiment (Aimation, perhaps a chlamus 
Matt. 27:28, 31) is sprinkled or dipped as the case may be, 
not his own blood on Calvary (1:5; 5:9; 7:14; 12:11), but | 
proleptically and prophetically the blood of Christ’s en- 
emies. Haimati can be either locative case with debam- 
menon (dipped in blood) or instrumental with rerantismenon 
(sprinkled with blood). The Word of God (ho Logos tou 
theou). Some scholars hold this addition inconsistent with 
verse 12, but it may be merely the explanation of the secret 
name or still another name besides that known only to 
himself. The personal use of the Logos applied to Christ 
occurs only in the Johannine writings unless that is the idea 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 453 


in Heb. 4:12. In John 1:1, 14 it is merely Ao Logos (the 
Word), in I John 1:1 Ao Logos tés zd@s (the Word of Life), 
while here it is ho Logos tou theou (the Word of God), one 
of the strongest arguments for identity of authorship. The 
idiom here is one common in Luke and Paul for the teach- 
ing of Christ (Luke 5:1; 8:11, etc.; I Cor. 14:36; II Cor. 
2:17, etc.). Jesus is himself the final and perfect revelation 
of God to men (Heb. 1:1f.). 

14. The armies which are in heaven (ta strateumata ta en 
t0i ourandt). See 12:7 for Michael and angels warring with 
the dragon, and also Matt. 26:53 for the angels at Christ’s 
call, not to say Heb. 1:6f., 14; Matt. 13:41; Rev. s:11f. . 
Followed (ékolouthei). Imperfect active and singular (strate- 
umata, neuter plural) of akolouthed, graphic picture of the 
celestial Warrior with his angelic hosts “upon white horses” 
(eph’ hippois leukois) like the Leader and, like him “‘clothed 
in fine linen white and pure” (endedumenoi bussinon leukon 
katharon) like the Leader again (19:8). Note endedumenoi 
here as in 1:13 and 15:6. 

15. 4 sharp sword (romphaia oxeia). As in 1:16 and 2:12, 
15. That he should smite (hina pataxéi). Purpose clause 
with hina and the first aorist active subjunctive of patassd, 
old verb already in 11:6 and like Is. 11:4, a figure here for 
forensic and judicial condemnation. And he shall rule them 
(kai autos poimanei). Emphatic use of autos twice (he him- 
self). Future active of poimaind, to shepherd as in 2:27, 
and 12:5 “with a rod of iron” (en rabdoi sidérdi) as there. 
See I] Pet. 2:25 and Heb. 13:20 for Christ as Shepherd. 
And he treadeth (kai autos patei). Change to present tense 
of pated, to tread (here transitive), with solemn repetition 
of kai autos. The winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of 
Almighty God (ten lenon tou oinou tou thumou tés orges tou 
theou tou pantokratoros). Literally, “the winepress of the 
wine of the wrath of the anger of God the Almighty” (four 
genitives dependent on one another and on /énon). These 


4s4 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


images are here combined from 14:8, 10, 19f.; 16:19. The 
fact is already in 19:13 after Is. 63:1ff. 

16. And on his thigh (kai epi ton méron autou). “Even 
upon his thigh.” Old word, here alone in N.T. King of 
kings, and Lord of lords (Basileus basileon kai Kurios kurion). 
The title already given to the Lamb in 17:14, but in reverse 
order. See the same idea in I Tim. 6:15. 

17. An angel (hena aggelon). Like heis in 18:21, just 
“an,” not “one.” Standing in the sun (hestota en toi héli61). 
Second perfect active participle of Aist@mi (intransitive). 
“Where all the birds of prey would behold him” (Beck- 
with). For orneois (birds) see 18:2 and for en mesouranémati 
(in mid heaven) see 18:13; 14:6. Come and be gathered to- 
gether (Deute sunachthéte). Deute is the adverb deuro (hither), 
used when two or more are addressed, possibly from deuro 
ite (come here). Asyndeton also without kai (and). First 
aorist passive imperative of sunagd. The metaphor is drawn 
from Ezek. 39:17. Unto the great supper of God (eis to 
deipnon to mega tou theou). The habits of vultures are de- 
scribed by Christ in Matt. 24:28. This is a bold and power- 
ful picture of the battlefield after the victory of the Messiah, 
“a sacrificial feast spread on God’s table for all the vultures 
of the sky” (Swete). Is this battle the same as that of Har 
Magedon (16:16) and that of Gog and Magog (20:8ff.) men- 
tioned after the thousand years? The language in 20:8ff. 
seems like this derived from Ezek. 39:17ff., and “in the. 
Apocalypse priority in the order of sequence does not always 
imply priority in time” (Swete). There seems no way to 
decide this point save that the end seems to be at hand. 

18. That ye may eat (hina phagéte). Purpose clause with 
hina and the second aorist active subjunctive of esthid. The 
flesh of kings (sarkas basiledn). “Pieces of flesh” (plural of 
sarx, flesh) and of all classes and conditions of men who fell 
in the battle (6:18; 11:13; 13:16; 19:5; 20:12). War is no 
respecter of persons. 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 455 


19. Gathered together (sunégmena). Perfect passive par- 
ticiple of sunagd. In battle array. To make war against 
(poiésai polemon meta). First aorist active infinitive of 
poied, to express purpose. See polemed meta in 12:7 and the 
use of sunagd eis polemon in 16:14; 20:8. The beast (for 
his army see 16:13f.) led a league of ten kings against 
Babylon in 17:16f., but with the purpose also of fighting 
the Lamb (17:14). 

20. Was taken (epiasthé). First aorist (prophetic) passive 
indicative of the Doric piazd (Attic piezo). Cf. II Thess. 
2:8. The false prophet (ho pseudoprophétés). Possibly the 
second beast of 13:11-17; 16:13; 20:10. Charles takes him - 
to be “the priesthood of the Imperial cult, which practised 
all kinds of magic and imposture to beguile men to worship 
the Beast.” That wrought the signs in his sight (ho poiésas 
ta sémeia endpion autou). Asin 13:14. Wherewith (en hois). 
“In which” signs. He deceived (eplanésen). First aorist 
active indicative of planad. He was only able to deceive 
“them that had received” (tous Jabontas, articular second 
aorist active participle of /amband, ‘those receiving’’) “the 
mark of the beast” (13:16; 14:9ff.; 16:2; 20:4) “‘and them 
that worshipped his image” (tous proskunountas tei eikoni 
autou) as in 13:15. They twain (hoi duo). “The two.” 
Were cast (ebléthésan). First aorist passive indicative of 
ballo. They fall together as they fought together. ‘‘The 
day that sees the end of a false statecraft will see also that 
of a false priestcraft” (Swete). live (zdntes). Present ac- 
tive participle of zd, predicative nominative, “living.” 
Into the lake of fire (eis tén limnén tou puros). Genitive puros 
describes this /imnén (lake, cf. Luke 5:1) as it does gehenna 
in Matt. 5:22. See also 20:10; 21:8. It is a different figure 
from the “abyss” in g:1ff. and 20:1ff. This is the final 
abode of Satan, the beast, the false prophet, and wicked 
men. That burneth with brimstone (tés kaiomenés en thei0t). 
Note the genitive here in place of the accusative limnén, 


456 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


perhaps because of the intervening genitive puros (neuter, 
not feminine). The agreement is regular in 21:8. For en 
theioi (with brimstone) see 14:10; 20:10; 21:8. The fact 
of hell is clearly taught here, but the imagery is not to be 
taken literally any more than that of heaven in chapters 
4, 5) 21, 22 is to be so understood. Both fall short of the 
reality. 

21. The rest (hoi loipoi). Of the enemy (the kings and 
their hosts of verse 19). Were killed (apektanthésan). First 
aorist (effective) passive indicative of apokteind. Those 
affected by the Cesar-worship (14:9ff.) were not at once 
cast into the lake with the two beasts. Were filled (echortas- 
thésan). First aorist (effective) passive of chortazd. As they 
had been invited to do in verse 17. 


CHAPTER XX 


1. Coming down out of heaven (katabainonta ek tou ouranou). 
As in 10:1; 18:1. The key of the abyss (tén klein tés abussou). 
As in 9:1. 4 great chain (halusin megalen). Paul wore a 
halusis (alpha privative and /ué, to loose) in Rome (II Tim. 
1:16), as did Peter in prison in Jerusalem (Acts 12:6). In 
his hand (epi tén cheira autou). “Upon his hand,” ready 
for use. See epi with the genitive in 1:20. 

2. He laid hold on (ekratésen). First aorist active indica- 
tive of krated, to seize. The dragon (ton drakonta). Accusa- 
tive after ekratésen instead of the genitive as in 2:1. He has 
been behind the beast and the false prophet from the start. 
Now he is seized. The old serpent (ho ophis ho archaios). 
Precisely the description in 12:9, only the nominative is here 
retained, though in apposition with the accusative fon 
drakonta, a frequent anacoluthon in the Apocalypse (1:5, 
etc.). Swete calls it a parenthesis. Which is (hos estin). 
The relative here relieves the construction and takes the 
place of ho kaloumenos in 12:9 before Diabolos kai ho Satanas. 
And bound him (kai edésen auton). First aorist active in- 
dicative of deo. For a thousand years (chilia et@). Accusative 
of extent of time. Here we confront the same problem found 
in the 1260 days. In this book of symbols how long is a 
thousand years? All sorts of theories are proposed, none 
of which fully satisfy one. Perhaps Peter has given us the 
only solution open to us in II Pet. 3:8 when he argues that 
“one day with the Lord is as a thousand years and a thou- 
sand years as one day.” It will help us all to remember 
that God’s clock does not run by ours and that times and 
seasons and programs are with him. This wonderful book 

457 


458 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


was written to comfort the saints in a time of great trial, 
not to create strife among them. 

3. Into the abyss (eis ten abusson). The one in g:1f. and 
the one spoken of by the legion of demons in Luke 8:31 
under the charge of the angel of the abyss (Apollyon, Rev. 
g:11) who is either Satan himself or a kindred power. 
“Already he has been cast out of Heaven (12:9), now he 
is cast out of the earth, and returns to his own place” 
(Swete). Shut it and sealed it (ekleisen kai esphragisen). 
Effective first aorists active indicative of k/eid and sphragizo. 
That he should deceive no more (hina mé planéséi). Negative 
purpose clause with hina mé and the first aorist active sub- 
junctive of planad. Glorious relief after the strain of the 
previous visions of conflict. Small wonder that Christians 
today cherish this blessed hope whatever the actual mean- 
ing may be. Until should be finished (achri telesthéi). Tem- 
poral clause of future purpose with achri (as a conjunction 
like eds) and the first aorist passive subjunctive of ¢eled. 
Repeated in verse 5 and see achri and the subjunctive in 
7:33 15:8. He must be loosed (dei luthénai). Sad necessity, 
alas, with dei and the first aorist passive infinitive of Jud. 
For a little time (mikron chronon). Accusative of time. 
Whatever the thousand years means, it is here said plainly 
that after it is over the devil will again have power on earth 
“for a little time.” 

4. And they sat upon them (kai ekathisan ep’ autous).. 
First aorist active indicative of kathizd. Another period 
here apparently synchronous (verse 7) with the confinement 
of Satan in the abyss. No subject is given for this plural 
verb. Apparently Christ and the Apostles (Matt. 19:28; 
Luke 22:30) and some of the saints (I Cor. 6:3), martyrs 
some hold. Yudgment was given unto them (krima édoth? 
autois). First aorist passive of diddmi. Picture of the 
heavenly court of assizes. The souls (tas psuchas). Accusa- 
tive after eidon at the beginning of the verse. Of them that 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 459 


had been beheaded (tin pepelekismenon). Genitive of the 
articular perfect passive participle of pelekizd, old word 
(from pelekus an axe, the traditional instrument for execu- 
tion in republican Rome, but later supplanted by the sword), 
to cut off with an axe, here only in N.T. See 6:9; 18:24; 
19:2 for previous mention of these martyrs for the witness 
of Jesus (1:9; 12:17; 19:10). Others also besides martyrs 
shared in Christ’s victory, those who refused to worship the 
beast or wear his mark as in 13:15; 14:9ff.; 16:2; 19:20. 
And they lived (kai ezésan). First aorist active indicative 
of za0. If the ingressive aorist, it means “came to life” ; 
or “‘lived again” as in 2:8 and so as to verse 5. If it is the 
constative aorist here and in verse 5, then it could mean 
increased spiritual life. See John 5:21-29 for the double 
sense of life and death (now literal, now spiritual) precisely 
as we have the second death in Rev. 2:11; 20:6, 14. And 
reigned with Christ (kai ebasileusan meta tou Christou). Same 
use of the first aorist active indicative of basileud, but more 
clearly constative. Beckwith and Swete take this to apply 
solely to the martyrs, the martyrs’ reign with Christ. 

5. The rest of the dead (hoi loipoi ton nekron). “All except 
the martyrs, both the righteous and the unrighteous” (Beck- 
with). But some take this to mean only the wicked. Lived 
not until the thousand years should be finished (ouk ezésan 
achri telesthét ta chilia et@). See verse 4 for the items here. 
“To infer from this statement, as many expositors have 
done, that the ezésan of v. 4 must be understood of bodily 
resuscitation, is to interpret apocalyptic prophecy by meth- 
ods of exegesis which are proper to ordinary narrative” 
(Swete). I sympathize wholly with that comment and con- 
fess my own ignorance therefore as to the meaning of the 
symbolism without any predilections for post-millennialism 
or premillennialism. This is the first resurrection (hauté hé 
anastasis hé proté). Scholars differ as to the genuineness of 
this phrase. Accepting it as genuine, Swete applies it to 


460 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


“the return of the martyrs and confessors to life at the 
beginning of the Thousand Years.” According to this view 
the first resurrection is a special incident in the present life 
before the Parousia. It has no parallel with I Thess. 4:16, 
where the dead in Christ are raised before those living are 
changed. Some think that John here pictures the “Re- 
generation” (palingenesia) of Matt. 19:28 and the “Res- 
toration” (apokatastasis) of Acts 3:21. No effort is here 
made to solve this problem, save to call attention to the 
general judgment out of the books in 20:12 and to the 
general resurrection in John 5:29 and Acts 24:15. 

6. Blessed and holy (makarios kai hagios). A fifth beati- 
tude (1:3; 14:13; 16:15; 19:9) already and two more to 
come (22:7, 14, seven in all). Here Aagios is added to the 
usual makarios. The second death (ho deuteros thanatos). 
The spiritual death of 2:11; 20:14; 21:8 in contrast to the 
first or physical death. This language raises a question 
about the interpretation of the first and the second resur- 
rections, whether both are of the body or one of the spirit. 
There seems no way to reach a solid conception about it. 
In I Cor. 15:23 there is no mention of the resurrection of 
any save “those of Christ” (hoi tou Christou), though the 
end follows (verse 24). However, Paul elsewhere (Acts 
24:15) speaks of the resurrection of the just and of the un- 
just as if one event. Priests of God and of Christ (hiereis 
tou theou kai tou Christou). As in 1:6; 5:10; 22:3, 5. Shall 
reign with him (basileusousin met autou). As promised in 
the same passages. The servants of God are to be priests 
with Christ and to reign with him (Matt. 19:28). In 5:10 
epi tes gés (upon earth) occurs, but this item does not appear 
here. “No hint is given as to where this service is to be 
rendered and this royalty to be exercised” (Swete). 

7. When are finished (hotan telesthéi). Indefinite future 
temporal clause with otan and the first aorist passive sub- 
junctive of teed, “‘whenever are finished.” Shall be loosed 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 461 


(futhésetai). Future passive of Jud, no longer bound as in 
20:2f. He uses the future as a prophet in verses 7 and 8, 
but in 9 and 10 he uses the aorist as a seer. Out of his prison 
(ck tés phulakés autou). For phulaké in this sense see 2:10. 
Out of the abyss of verses 2 and 3. 

8. To deceive the nations (planésai ta ethné). First aorist 
active infinitive of purpose of planad, Satan’s chief task 
(chapters 12 to 18, in particular 12:9; 13:14; 193203112033) 
10). Which are in the four corners of the earth (ta en tais 
tessarst goniais tes gés). Clearly the reign with Christ, if 
on earth, was not shared in by all on earth, for Satan finds 
a large and ready following on his release. See 7:1 (Is. 
11:12) for “the four corners of the earth.” Gog and Magog 
(ton Gog kai Magog). Accusative in explanatory apposition 
with ¢a ethné (the nations). Magog is first mentioned in 
Gen. 10:2. The reference here seems to be Ezek. g8ang 
where both are mentioned. Josephus (4nt. I. 6.1) iden- 
tifies Magog with the Scythians, with Gog as their prince. 
In the rabbinical writings Gog and Magog appear as the 
enemies of the Messiah. Some early Christian writers 
thought of the Goths and Huns, but Augustine refuses to 
narrow the imagery and sees only the final protest of the 
world against Christianity. To gather them together to the 
war (sunagagein autous eis ton polemon). Second aorist ac- 
tive infinitive of purpose of sunagd, a congenial task for 
Satan after his confinement. See 16:14 for this very phrase 
and also 17:14; 19:19. Of whom (hon—auton). Pleonasm 
or redundant pronoun as in 3:8 and often (of whom—of 
them). 4s the sand of the sea (hos h@ ammos tés thalassés). 
Already in 12:18. Clearly then the millennium, whatever 
it is, does not mean a period when Satan has no following 
on earth, for this vast host rallies at once to his standard. 

9. They went up (anebésan). Second aorist active indica- 
tive of anabaind, a return to the manner of the seer as in 
verses 4 and 5. Over the breadth of the earth (epi to platos 


q62 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


tés gés). Platos is old word, in N.T. only here, 21:16; Eph. 
3:18. The hosts of Satan spread over the earth. Compassed 
(ekukleusan). First aorist (prophetic) active indicative of 
kukleué, to encircle, late verb (Strabo) from kuk/os (circle), 
in N.T. only here and margin in John 10:24 (for ekuklosan 
from kukloo). The camp of the saints (ten parembolén ton 
hagion). Parembolé (para, en, ballo) is common late word 
for military camp, in LXX for the Israelites in the desert 
(Ex. 29:14, etc.), in N.T. for Roman barracks (Acts 24:34, 
37) and for an army in line of battle (Heb. 11:34; Rev. 
20:9). The beloved city (tén polin ten égapémenén). Perfect 
passive participle of agapad, “the city the beloved.” See 
Ps. 78:68; 87:2 for Jerusalem so described. So Charles takes 
it here, but Swete holds it to be “the Church the New Zion” 
that is meant. 4nd fire came down out of heaven (kai katebé 
pur ek tou ouranou). Second aorist (prophetic) active in- 
dicative of katabaind. Cf. Gen. 19:24; 39:6; Ezek. 38:22; 
II Kings 1:10, 12; Luke 9:54 (about John). Devoured them 
(katephagen autous). Second aorist (prophetic) active of 
katesthio, to eat up (down). Vivid climax to this last great 
battle with Satan. 

10. Was cast (ebléthé). First aorist (prophetic, affective) 
passive indicative of dalld (verse 3). Into the lake of fire 
and brimstone (eis ten limnén tou puros kai theiou). As in 
19:20 with the two beasts, as he adds, “‘where are also the 
beast and the false prophet” (hopou kai to thérion kai ho 
pseudoprophetés). They shall be tormented (basanisthésontai). 
Return to the prophetic future of verses 7 and 8. For 
basanizd see 9:5; 14:10. For “day and night” (Aémeras 
kai nuktos) see 4:8; 7:15; 12:10; 14:11. For “for ever and 
ever” (eis tous aidnas ton aidnodn) see 1:6, 18; 4:9, 103 5:13; 
7:12; 10:6; 11:15, etc. The devil was cast down from 
heaven (12:9), then imprisoned (20:2ff.), now he received 
his final doom. 

11. 4 great white throne (thronon megan leukon). Were 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 463 


megan (great) is added to the throne pictures in 4:4; 20:4. 
The scene is prepared for the last judgment often mentioned 
in the N.T. (Matt. 25:31-46; Rom. 14:10; IIT Cor. 5:10). 
“The absolute purity of this Supreme Court is symbolized 
by the colour of the Throne” (Swete) as in Dan. 7:9; Ps. 
9:1; 97:2. The name of God is not mentioned, but the 
Almighty Father sits upon the throne (4:2f., OM S2tp Mig: 
6:16; 7:10, 15; 19:4; 21:5), and the Son sits there with him 
(Heb. 1:3) and works with the Father (John §s19-21 102303 
Matt. 25:31ff.; Acts 17:31; II Cor. §:10; II Tim. 4:1). 
From whose face the earth and the heaven fled away (hou apo 
prosopou ephugen hé gé kai ho ouranos). Second aorist 
(prophetic) active of pheugd. See 16:20. The non-eternity 
of matter is a common teaching in the O.T. (Ps. OFi5y 
102:27; Is. 51:6) as in the N.T. (Mark 13:31; II Pet. Rs10): 
Was found (heurethé). First aorist passive indicative of 
heurisko. All is now spiritual. Even scientists today are 
speaking of the non-eternity of the universe. 

12. The dead, the great. and the small (tous nekrous tous 
megalous kai tous mikrous). The general resurrection of 
verse 13 is pictured by anticipation as already over. No 
living are mentioned after the battle of verses 7-10, though 
some will be living when Jesus comes to judge the quick 
and the dead (II Tim. 4:1; I Thess. 4:13ff.). All classes 
and conditions (11:18; 13:16; 19:5, 18) John saw “standing 
before the throne” (hestdtas endpion tou thronou). Books 
were opened (biblia énoichthésan). First aorist passive of 
anoigd. Like Dan. 7:10. The record of each human being 
has been kept in God’s books. Were judged (ekrithésan). 
First aorist passive indicative of krind. The sentence upon 
each rests upon written evidence. Another book which is 
the book of life (allo biblion ho estin tés z0és). This book has 
already been mentioned (3:5; 13:8; 17:8). “It is the roll 
of living citizens of Jerusalem” (Swete), “‘the church of the 
first born enrolled in heaven” (Heb. 12:23). The books are 


464 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


“the vouchers for the book of life” (Alford). We are saved 
by grace, but character at last (according to their works) 
is the test as the fruit of the tree (Matt. 7:16, 20; 10:32f.; 
26:31-46; John 15:6; II Cor. 5:10; Rom. 2:10; Rev. 2:23; 
20312; 22:12): 

13. Gave up (eddken). Just “gave” (first aorist active 
indicative of didémi), but for the sea to give is to give up 
(effective aorist). Sea as well as land delivers its dead (all 
kinds of dead, good and bad). Swete notes that accidental 
deaths will not prevent any from appearing. Milligan is 
sure that the sea here means “the sea of the troubled and 
sinful world.” Death and Hades (ho thanatos kai ho haidés). 
“An inseparable pair” (Swete) as in 1:18; 6:8; 20:14. So 
in Matt. 16:18 “the gates of Hades” means the power of 
death. Etymologically Hades is the unseen world where all 
who die are as opposed to this visible world, but in actual 
use Hades is sometimes treated as the abode of the un- 
righteous (Luke 16:23). Charles thinks that this is true 
here, though there is nothing to show it apart from the 
personification of death and Hades and the casting of both 
into the lake of fire in verse 14. Here again “each man” 
(hekastos) receives judgment according to his deeds (Matt. 
16:27 -Ti-Corin 3233 Te Corng:t03;Romig2i6s 24:12 yl Pet 
feds REV02223)3 

14. Were cast (ebléthésan). As the devil (20:10) followed 
the two beasts (19:20) into the same dread lake of fire. 
Death is personified and is disposed of, “‘the last enemy” 
(I Cor. 15:26) and Paul sings the pean of victory over 
death (I Cor. 15:54f., from Hos. 13:14). Hades has no more 
terrors, for the saints are in heaven. There is no more fear 
of death (Heb. 2:15), for death is no more (Rev. 21:4). 
The second death (2:11; 20:6; 21:8) is here identified as in 
21:8 with the lake of fire. 

15. If any was not found written in the book of life (ei tis 
ouch heurethé en téi bibloi tés z0é@s). Condition of first class 


<¢ 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 465 


with ei and the first aorist passive indicative of heuriské. 
In this short sentence the doom is told of all who are out 
of Christ, for they too follow the devil and the two beasts 
into the lake of fire (the counterpart of the Gehenna of fire, 
Matt. 5:22). There-is no room here for soul sleeping, for 
an intermediate state, for a second chance, or for annihila- 
tion of the wicked. In Dan. 12:2 there is a resurrection to 
death as well as to life and so in John §:29; Acts 24:15. 


CHAPTER XXI 


1. 4 new heaven and a new earth (ouranon kainon kai gen 
kainén). This new vision (eidon) is the picture of the bliss 
of the saints. The first heaven and the first earth (ho protos 
ouranos kai hé proté gé) are passed away (apélthan, went 
away, second aorist active indicative of aperchomai). “Fled 
away” (ephugen) in 20:11. And the sea is no more (kai hé 
thalassa ouk estin eti). The sea had given up its dead (20:13). 
There were great risks on the sea (18:17ff.). The old phys- 
ical world is gone in this vision. It is not a picture of reno- 
vation of this earth, but of the disappearance of this earth 
and sky (not heaven where God dwells). It is a glorious 
picture here in 21:1-8 in sharp contrast to the lake of fire 
in 20:11-15. The symbolism in neither case is to be pressed 
too literally, but a stern and a glorious reality exists behind 
it all. 

2. The holy city, new Ferusalem (ten polin ten hagian 
Terousalém kainén). “The New Earth must have a new 
metropolis, not another Babylon, but another and greater 
Jerusalem” (Swete), and not the old Jerusalem which was 
destroyed a.p. 70. It was called the Holy City in a conven- 
tional way (Matt. 4:5; 27:53), but now in reality because it is - 
new and fresh (kainén), this heavenly Jerusalem of hope 
(Heb. 12:22), this Jerusalem above (Gal. 4:26ff.) where our 
real citizenship is (Phil. 3:20). Coming down out of heaven 
from God (katabainousan ek tou ouranou apo tou theou). 
Glorious picture caught by John and repeated from 3:12 and 
again in 21:10. But Charles distinguishes this new city of 
God from that in 21:9 to 22:2 because there is no tree of life 
in this one. But one shrinks from too much manipulation of 
this symbolism. It is better to see the glorious picture with 

466 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 467 


John and let it tell its own story. Made ready (hétoimas- 
menen). Perfect passive participle of hetoimazd as in 19:7. 
The Wife of the Lamb made herself ready in her bridal 
attire. 4s a bride adorned (hos numphén kekosméemenén). 
Perfect passive participle of kosmed, old verb (from kosmos 
ornament like our cosmetics), as in 21:19. Only here the 
figure of bride is not the people of God as in 19:7, but the 
abode of the people of God (the New Jerusalem). For her 
husband (toi andri autés). Dative case of personal interest. 

3. The tabernacle of God is with men (hé skéné tou theou 
meta ton anthropon). It is one of the angels of the Presence 
(16:17; 19:5) speaking. And he shall dwell with them (kai 
skénosei met’ auton). Future active of skénod, already in 7:15 
from Ezek. 37:27; Zech. 2:10; 8:8 and used of the Incarnate 
Christ on earth by John (1:14), now a blessed reality of the 
Father. The metaphor stands for the Shekinah Glory of 
God in the old tabernacle (7:15; 13:6; 15:5), the true taber- 
nacle of which it was a picture (Heb. 8:2;9:11). God is now 
Immanuel in fact, as was true of Christ (Matt. 1:23). 

4. Shall wipe away every tear from their eyes (exaleipset pan 
dakruon ek ton ophthalmon auton). More exactly, “shall wipe 
out every tear out of their eyes” (repetition of ex) like a 
tender mother as in 7:17 (Is. 25:8). There is no more 
that ought to cause a tear, for death (thanatos) is no more, 
mourning (penthos), associated with death and crying 
(kraugé, wailing), and pain (ponos as in 16:10) are all gone. 
There is peace and bliss. 

5. Behold, I make all things new (Idou kaina poio panta). 
The first time since 1:8 that God has been represented as 
speaking directly, though voices have come out of the throne 
before (21:3) and out of the sanctuary (16:1, 17), which may 
be from God himself, though more likely from one of the 
angels of the Presence. This message is not addressed to 
John (7:14; 17:73 21:6; 22:6), but to the entire world of the 
blessed. See Is. 43:18f. for the words (Idou ego poid kaina).

The idea of a new heaven and a new earth is in Is. 65:17; 
66:22; Ps. 102:25f. For the locative here with epi (epi toi 
thronot) see 7:10; 19:4 (genitive more usual, 4:9f.; 5:1, 7, 13, 
etc.). See 20:11 for the picture. And he saith (kai legei). 
Probably this means a change of speakers, made plain by moi 
(to me) in many MSS. An angel apparently (as in 14:13; 
1g:9f.) assures John and urges him to write (grapson as in 
Ts1T;) 2:1, 8, 12, 185 3:15. 7, 145:14:3). 1! The reason given 
(hoti, for) is precisely the saying in 22:6 and he uses the two 
adjectives (pistoi kai aléthinoi) employed in 19:11 about God 
himself, and 3:14 about Christ. In 19:9 aléthinoi occurs also 
about “the words of God” as here. They are reliable and 
genuine. 

6. They are come to pass (Gegonan). Second perfect active 
indicative of ginomai with -an for -asi. See 16:17 for a like 
use of gegonen, “They have come to pass.” Here again it is 
the voice of God because, as in 1:8, He says: I am the Alpha 
and the Omega (Ego to Alpha kai to O) with the addition “the 
beginning and the end” (Aé arché kai to telos), the whole used 
in 22:13 of Christ. In Is. 44:6 there is something like the 
addition, and in Col. 1:18 and Rev. 3:14 4é arch? is applied 
to Christ, while here God is the First Cause (arché) and the 
Finality (¢e/os) as in Rom. 11:36 and Eph. 4:6. But God 
works through Christ (John 1:3; Heb. 1:2f.; Col. 1:12—20). 
God is the bountiful Giver (James 1:5, 17) of the Water of 
Life. See 7:17; 22:1, 17 for this metaphor, which is based . 
on Is. 55:1. It is God’s own promise (Egéd désd), “I will 
give.” Of the fountain (ek tés pégés). For this partitive use 
of ek see Matt. 25:8, without ek Rev. 2:17. Freely (dorean). 
See Matt. 10:8; John 4:10; Rom. 3:24; Acts 8:20; Rev. 22:17. 

7. He that overcometh (ho nikon). Recalls the promises at 
the close of each of the Seven Letters in chapters 2 and 3. 
Shall inherit (kleronomései). Future active of kléronomeo, 
word with great history (Mark 10:17; I Pet. 1:4; Gal. 4:7; 
Rom. 8:17), here interpreted for the benefit of these who 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 469 


share in Christ’s victory. J will be his God (Esomai autoi 
theos). Repeated Old Testament promise (first to Abraham, 
Gen. 17:7f.). Cf. Rev. 21:3. He shall be my son (autos 
estai moi huios). Made first of Solomon (II Sam. 7:14) and 
applied to David later in Ps. 89:26f. 

8. Their part shall be (to meros auton). In contrast to 
the state of the blessed (verses 3 to 7) the state of “those 
who have disfranchised themselves from the Kingdom of 
God”’ (Charles) is given. They are with Satan and the 
two beasts, and are the same with those not in the book of 
life (20:15) in the lake of fire and brimstone (19:20; 20:10, 
14f.), that is the second death (2:11; 20:6, 14). See also 
14:10. There are eight epithets here used which apply to 
various sections of this direful list of the doomed and the 
damned, all in the dative (case of personal interest). For 
the fearful (tois deilois). Old word (from deidé, to fear) for 
the cowardly, who recanted under persecution, in N.T. only 
here, Matt. 8:26; Mark 4:40. Unbelieving (apistois). “Faith- 
less,” “untrustworthy,” in contrast with Christ “ho pistos” 
(1:5). Cf. 2:10, 13; 3:14; 17:14. Disloyalty is close kin to 
cowardice. Abominable (ebdelugmenois). Perfect passive 
participle of ddelussd, old verb, in N.T. only here and Rom. 
2:22, common in LXX, to pollute (Ex. 5:21). Those who 
have become defiled by the impurities of emperor-worship 
(7:4f.; 21:27; Rom. 2:22; Titus 1:16). Murderers (phoneu- 
sin). As a matter of course and all too common always 
(Mark 7:21; Rom. 1:29; Rev. 9:21). Fornicators (pornos). 
Again all too common always, then and now (I Cor. 5:10; 
I Tim. 1:9f.). These two crimes often go together. Sorcer- 
ers (pharmakois). Old word, in N.T. only here and 22:15. 
Closely connected with idolatry and magic (9:21; 13:13f.). 
Idolaters (eidélolatrais). See 1 Cor. §:10f.; 10:7; Eph. 5:5; 
Rey. 22:15. With a powerful grip on men’s lives then and 
now. All liars (pasi tois pseudesin). Repeated in 22:15 


470 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


and stigmatized often (2:2; 3:9; 14:5; 21:8, 27; 22:15). Not 
a “light” sin. 

g. One of the seven angels (heis ek ton hepta aggelon). As 
in 17:1 with the same introduction when the angel made 
the announcement about the harlot city (Babylon), so here 
the description of the heavenly city, the New Jerusalem, is 
given by one of the same group of angels who had the seven 
bowls. Thus the numphé (Bride) is placed in sharp con- 
trast with the porné (Harlot). The New Jerusalem was 
briefly presented in verse 2, but now is pictured at length 
(21:9-22:5) in a nearer and clearer vision. The bride the 
wife of the Lamb (tén numphén ten gunaika tou arniou). 
Twice already the metaphor of the Bride has been used 
(19:7; 21:2), here termed “‘wife” (gunaika), mentioned pro- 
leptically as in 19:7 if the marriage is not yet a reality. For 
the use of the same metaphor elsewhere in the N.T. see on 
19:7. 

10. He carried me away in the Spirit (apénegken me en 
pneumati). See same language in 17:7 when John received 
a vision of the Harlot City in a wilderness. Here it is “to 
a mountain great and high” (epi oros mega kai hupsélon). 
So it was with Ezekiel (40:2) and so the devil took Jesus 
(Matt. 4:8). It was apparently not Mount Zion (14:1), 
for the New Jerusalem is seen from this mountain. ‘The 
Seer is carried thither ‘in spirit’ (cf. 1:10; 4:1); the Angel’s 
deuro is a sursum cor to which his spirit under the influence ~ 
of the ‘Spirit of revelation’ (Eph. 1:17) at once responds” 
(Swete). And he shewed me (kai edeixen moi). First aorist 
active indicative of deiknumi, just as he had said he would 
do in verse 9 (deixd soi, I will shew thee). Precisely the 
same words about Jerusalem as in verse 2, save the absence 
of kainén (New). 

11. Having the glory of God (echousan tén doxan tou theou). 
Syntactically this clause goes with verse 10, the feminine 
accusative singular participle echousan agreeing with po/in, 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 47 


the radiance of the dazzling splendour of God as seen in 
Is. 60:1; Ezek. 43:5. God’s very presence is in the Holy 
City (the Bride). Light (phdstér). “Luminary,” late word 
(in LXX, papyri), in N.T. only here and Phil. 2:15. Christ 
is the light (pAds) of the world (John 8:12) and so are Chris- 
tians (Matt. 5:14) who have received the illumination 
(photismos) of God in the face of Christ (II Cor. 4:6) and 
who radiate it to men (Phil. 2:15). See both words in Gen. 
1:3, 14. “The ‘luminary’ of the Holy City is her witness 
to Christ” (Swete). Like unto a stone most precious (homoios 
lith0i timidtatoi). Associative instrumental case after homoi- 
os. Timtdtatoi is the elative superlative. As it were a- 
jasper stone (hos lithoi iaspidi). As in 4:3, which see. Clear 
as crystal (krustallizonti). Verb not found elsewhere from 
krustallos (old word, 4:6; 22:1), ‘‘of crystalline brightness 
and transparency” (Thayer), “transparent and gleaming as 
rock-crystal”’ (Moffatt). 

12. Having a wall great and high (echousa teichos mega kai 
hupsélon). John returns, after the parenthesis in verse 11, 
to the structure in verse 10, only to use the accusative 
echousan as before to agree with po/in, but the nominative 
echousa as again with “twelve gates” (pulonas dodeka). 
Pulon is an old word (from pu/é gate) for a large gate as in 
Luke 16:20 and six times in Rev. for the gate tower of a 
city wall (21:12, 13, 15, 21, 25; 22:14) as in I Kings 17:10; 
Acts 14:13. See Ezek. 48:31ff. for these twelve gates, one 
for each tribe (cf. Rev. 7:1-8). At the gates (epi tois pulosin). 
“Upon the gate towers.” Twelve angels (aggelous dodeka). 
As puloroi or phulakes according to Is. 62:6; II Chron. 8:14. 
Names written thereon (onomata epigegrammena). Perfect 
passive participle of epigraphd. Which are the names (ha 
estin). Just as in Ezekiel’s vision (48:31ff.), so here the 
names of the twelve tribes of Israel appear, one on each 

ate. 
r 13. Three gates (pulones treis) on each of the four sides 


472 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


as in Ezek. 42:16ff.; “on the east” (apo anatolés, as in 
16:12, starting from the east), “‘on the north” (apo dorra, 
from the north, as in Luke 13:29), ‘“‘on the south” (apo 
notou, from the south, as in Luke 13:29), “on the west” 
(apo dusmon, from the west, as in Matt. 8:11). 

14. Had (echon). Masculine present active participle of 
echo instead of echon (neuter like to teichos), and the par- 
ticiple occurs independently as if a principal verb (eichen) as 
often in this book. Twelve foundations (themelious dodeka). 
Foundation stones, old adjective (from thema, from tithémi), 
here as in I Cor. 3:11ff. and II Tim. 2:19, with /ithous (stones 
understood), though often neuter substantive to themelion 
(Luke 6:48f.; Acts 16:26). See Is. 28:16; Heb. 11:10. 
Twelve because of the twelve apostles as foundation stones 
(Eph. 2:20). On them (ep’ auton). On the twelve founda- 
tion stones. Names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (ono- 
mata ton dodeka apostolon tou arniou). Jesus had spoken of 
twelve thrones for the apostles (Matt. 19:28); names of all 
twelve are here written, not just that of Peter, as some would 
argue from Matt. 16:18. As a matter of fact, Christ is the 
corner stone or akrogoniaion (I Pet. 2:6; I Cor. 3:10; Eph. 
2:20), though rejected by the Sanhedrin (Matt. 21:42ff.). 
One may wonder if the name of Judas is on that stone or 
that of Matthias. 

15. Had (eichen). Regular imperfect here, no longer 
echon. For a measure a golden reed (metron kalamon chrusoun).. 
See 11:1 for kalamos (reed). Metron is an old word, kin to 
méter (mother, moulder, manager), an instrument for measur- 
ing (metred) as in Matt. 7:2, here in the predicate accusative. 
To measure (hina metrései). Purpose clause with Aina and 
the first aorist active subjunctive of metred. The rod of 
gold was in keeping with the dignity of the service of God 
(x22 5155857803 hageTGs Ne vay 

16. Lieth foursquare (tetragonos keitai). Present middle 
indicative of keimai. The predicate adjective is from tetra 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 473 


(olic for tessares four) and gonos (gonia corner, Matt. 6:5) 
here only in N.T. As in Ezek. 48:16, 20. It is a tetragon 
or quadrilateral quadrangle (21:12f.). The length thereof is as 
great as the breadth (to mékos autés hoson to platos). It is 
rectangular, both walls and city within. Babylon, according 
to Herodotus, was a square, each side being 120 stadia. 
Diodorus Siculus says that Nineveh was also foursquare. 
With the reed (toi kalaméi). Instrumental case (cf. verse 15 
for kalamos) and for metred (aorist active indicative here). 
Twelve thousand furlongs (epi stadion dideka chiliadon). This 
use of the genitive stadién with epi is probably correct (read- 
ing of Aleph P), though A Q have stadious (more usual, but - 
confusing here with chiliadon). Thucydides and Xenophon 
use epi with the genitive in a like idiom (in the matter of). 
It is not clear whether the 1500 miles (12,000 furlongs) is 
the measurement of each of the four sides or the sum total. 
Some of the rabbis argued that the walls of the New Jeru- 
salem of Ezekiel would reach to Damascus and the height 
would be 1500 miles high. Egual (isa). That is, it is a 
perfect cube like the Holy of Holies in Solomon’s temple 
(I Kings 6:19f.). This same measurement (platos, mékos, 
hupsos) is applied to Christ’s love in Eph. 3:18, with dathos 
(depth) added. It is useless to try to reduce the measure- 
ments or to put literal interpretations upon this highly 
wrought symbolic language. Surely the meaning is that 
heaven will be large enough for all, as Jesus said (John 
14:1ff.) without insisting on the materialistic measurement 
of a gorgeous apartment house full of inside rooms. 

17. 4 hundred and forty and four cubits (hekaton tessera- 
konta tessaron pechon). Another multiple of 12 (12X12= 
144) as in 7:4; 14:1. It is not clear whether it is the height 
or the breadth of the wall that is meant, though hupsos 
(height) comes just before. That would be 216 feet high 
(cf. verse 12), not enormous in comparison with the 7,000,000 
feet (1500 miles) height of the city. According to the measure 


474 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


of a man, that is, of an angel (metron anthropou, ho estin 
aggelou). No preposition for “according to,” just the accu- 
sative case of general reference in apposition with the verb 
emetrésen. ‘Though measured by an angel, a human stand- 
ard was employed, man’s measure which is angel’s (Bengel). 

18. The building of the wall (hé endomésis tou teichous). 
Or endomésis, elsewhere so far only in Josephus (At. XV. 9.6, 
a mole or breakwater) and in an inscription (Sy//. 583%), 
apparently from endomeo, to build in, and so the fact of 
building in. The wall had jasper (verse 11) built into it. 
Was pure gold (chrusion katharon). No copula én (was) 
expressed. The city shone like a mass of gold in contrast 
with the jasper lustre of the wall. Pure glass (hual0i katharoi). 
Associative instrumental case after homoion. Hualos (ap- 
parently from wei, it rains, and so raindrop) in N.T. only 
Rev. 21:18, 21. 

19. Were adorned (kekosmémenot). Perfect passive par- 
ticiple of kosmed as in verse 2, but without the copula ésan 
(were), followed by instrumental case /ithdi (stone). With 
all manner of precious stones (panti lithoi timioi). “With 
every precious stone.” The list of the twelve stones in 
verses Ig and 20 has no necessary mystical meaning. 
“The writer is simply trying to convey the impression of a 
radiant and superb structure” (Moffatt). The twelve gems 
do correspond closely (only eight in common) with. the 
twelve stones on the high priest’s breastplate (Ex. 28:17-20; 
39:10ff.; Ezek. 28:13; Is. 54:11f.). Charles identifies them 
with the signs of zodiac in reverse order, a needless perform- 
ance here. See the stones in Rev..4:3. These foundation 
stones are visible. For jasper (iaspis) see 4:33 21:11, 18; 
Is. 54:12; sapphire (sappheiros) see Ex. 24:10; Is. 54:11 
(possibly the /apis lazuli of Turkestan); chalcedony (chalké- 
don) we have no other reference in N.T. or LXX (described 
by Pliny, H.N. XXXIII.21), possibly a green silicate of 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 475 


copper from near Chalcedon; emerald (smaragdos) here only 
in N.T., see 4:3 smaragdinos, and like it a green stone. 

20. Sardonyx (sardonux), here only in N.T., white with 
layers of red, from sardion (red carnelian) and onyx (white); 
for sardius (sardion) see 4:3; chrysolite (chrusolithos), here only 
in N.T. (Ex. 28:20), stone of a golden colour like our topaz 
or amber or a yellow beryl or golden jasper; beryl (dérullos), 
again here only in N.T. (Ex. 28:20), note the difficulty of 
identification, much like the emerald according to Pliny; 
for topaz (topazion), here only in N.T. (Ex. 28:17), a golden- 
greenish stone; chrysoprase (chrusoprasos), here only in 
N.T. (not in LXX), in colour like a teek, translucent golden- 
green; jacinth (Auakinthos), of the colour of the hyacinth, 
a violet colour (Pliny), already in 9:17 like blue smoke, like 
achates in LXX; amethyst (amethustos), only here in N.T. 
(Ex. 28:19), of a violet and purple colour, more brilliant 
than the huakinthos. Swete sums up the colours thus: blue 
(sapphire, jacinth, amethyst), green (jasper, chalcedony, 
emerald, beryl, topaz, chrysoprase), red (sardonyx, sardius), 
yellow (chrysolite). But even so there is great variety in 
hue and brilliancy and in the reaction on each other. Clement 
of Alexandria argues that this variety illustrates the variety 
of gifts and graces in the twelve apostles. Possibly so. 

21. Twelve pearls (dodeka margaritai). These gate towers 
(pulones) were mentioned in verses 12f. Each of these (cf. 
Is. 54:12) is a pearl, one of the commonest of jewels (Matt. 
7:6; 13:46; I Tim. 2:9). Each one (ana heis hekastos). Dis- 
tributive use of ava, but with the nominative (used as ad- 
verb, not preposition) rather than the accusative (as a 
preposition) as appears also in Mark 14:19; John 8:9; with 
kata in Rom. 12:5, “a barbaric construction” according to 
Charles. Street (plateia). For which word (broad way, 
hodos understood) see Matt. 6:5, here the singular, but in- 
cludes all the streets. Transparent (diaugés). Old word 


476 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(from dia, through, augé, ray, shining through), here alone 
in N.T. 

22. I saw no temple therein (naon ouk eidon en autéi). 
“Temple I did not see in it.” The whole city is a temple in 
one sense (verse 16), but it is something more than a temple 
even with its sanctuary and Shekinah Glory in the Holy of 
Holies. For the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb are 
the temple thereof (ho gar Kurios ho theos ho pantokrator, 
naos autés estin kai to arnion). “For the Lord God, the 
Almighty, is the sanctuary of it and the Lamb.” The 
Eternal Presence is the Shekinah Glory of God (verse 3). 
In II Cor. 6:16 we are the sanctuary of God here, but now 
God is our Sanctuary, and so is the Lamb as in chapters 
4and 5. See 1:8 and often for the description of God here. 

23. To shine upon it (hina phainosin autéi). Purpose 
clause with Aina and the present active subjunctive of 
phainé, to keep on shining. Light is always a problem in 
our cities. See Is. 60:19ff. Did lighten it (ephotisen autéen). 
First aorist active indicative of phdtizd, to illumine, old verb 
from phos (Luke 11:36). If the sun and moon did shine, 
they would give no added light in the presence of the 
Shekinah Glory of God. See verse 11 for “the glory of 
God.” Cf. 18:1 and 21:3. “‘Their splendour is simply put 
to shame by the glory of God Himself” (Charles). And the 
lamp thereof is the Lamb (kai ho luchnos autés to arnion). 
Charles takes ho /uchnos as predicate, ‘“‘and the Lamb is the 
lamp thereof.” Bousset thinks that John means to com- 
pare Christ to the moon the lesser light (Gen. 1:16), but 
that contrast is not necessary. Swete sees Christ as the one 
lamp for all in contrast with the many /uchniai of the 
churches on earth (1:12, 20). ‘“‘No words could more clearly 
demonstrate the purely spiritual character of St. John’s 
conception of the New Jerusalem” (Swete). 

24. Amidst the light thereof (dia tou photos autés). Rather 
*by the light thereof.” From Is. 60:3, 11, 20. All the 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 477 


moral and spiritual progress of moderns is due to Christ, 
and the nations of earth will be represented, including “the 
kings” (hoi basileis), mentioned also in Isaiah 60:3, ‘““do 
bring their glory into it” (pherousin tén doxan auion eis 
autén). Present active indicative of pherd. Swete is un- 
certain whether this is a picture of heaven itself or “some 
gracious purpose of God towards humanity which has not 
yet been revealed” and he cites 22:2 in illustration. The 
picture is beautiful and glorious even if not realized here, 
but only in heaven. 

25. Shall in no wise be shut (ou mé kleisthosin). Double 
negative with the first aorist passive subjunctive of kei. - 
By day (hémeras). Genitive of time. Mentioned alone 
without nuktos (by night), “for there shall be no night 
there” (nux gar ouk estai ekei). This looks like a continued 
picture of heaven. 

26. They shall bring (oisousin). Future active indicative 
of pherd. Rome gathered the merchandise of the world 
(18:11ff.). The City of God will have the best of all the 
nations (Is. 60:5, 11), an expansion of verse 24. 

27. There shall in no wise enter into it (ou mé eiselthéi eis 
auten). Double negative again with the second aorist ac- 
tive subjunctive of eiserchomai with eis repeated. Like Is. 
52:1 and Ezek. 44:9. Anything unclean (pan koinon). Com- 
mon use of pan with negative like ouden, and the use of 
koinos for defiled or profane as in Mark 7:2; Acts 10:14, 
not just what is common to all (Titus 1:4). Or he that (kai 
ho). “And he that.” Maketh an abomination and a lie 
(poidn bdelugma kai pseudos). Like Babylon (17:4 which 
see for bdelugma) and 21:8 for those in the lake of fire and 
brimstone, and 22:15 for “every one loving and doing a 
lie.” These recurrent glimpses of pagan life on earth and 
of hell in contrast to heaven in this picture raise the ques- 
tion already mentioned whether John is just running par- 
allel pictures of heaven and hell after the judgment or 


478 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


whether, as Charles says: “The unclean and the abominable 
and the liars are still on earth, but, though the gates are 
open day and night, they cannot enter.” In apocalyptic 
writing literalism and chronology cannot be insisted on as 
in ordinary books. The series of panoramas continue to the 
end. But only they which are written (ei mé hoi gegram- 
menoi). “Except those written.” For “the book of life”

of life) see 7:17; 21:6; 22:17; John 4:14. There was a river 
in the Garden of Eden (Gen. 2:10). The metaphor of river 
reappears in Zech. 14:8; Ezek. 47:9, and the fountain of life 
in Joel 3:18; Jer. 2:13; Prov. ro:11; Deny yor 4227 a oe, 
Ps. 36:10. Bright as crystal (lampron hos krustallon). See 
4:6 for krustallon and 15:6; 19:8; 22:16 for lampron. “Spark- 
ling like rock crystal” (Swete), shimmering like mountain 
water over the rocks. Proceeding out of the throne of God 
and of the Lamb (ekporeuomenon ek tou thronou tou theou 
kai tou arniou). Cf. Ezek. 47:1; Zech. 14:8. Already in 
3:21 Christ is pictured as sharing the Father’s throne as in 
Heb. 1:3. See also 22:3. This phrase has no bearing on 
the doctrine of the Procession of the Holy Spirit. 

2. In the midst of the street thereof (en mesoi tés plateias 
autes). Connected probably with the river in verse 1, though 
many connect it with verse 2. Only one street mentioned 
here as in 21:21. On this side of the river and on that (tou 
potamou enteuthen kai ekeithen). Enteuthen occurs as a 
preposition in Daniel 12:5 (Theodoret) and may be so here 
(post-positive), purely adverbial in John 19:18. The tree 
of life («ulon z0és). For the metaphor see Gen. 1:11f. and 
Rev. 2:7; 22:14. Xulon is used for a green tree in Luke 
23:31; Ezek. 47:12. Bearing (poioun). Neuter active par- 
ticiple of poied (making, producing, as in Matt. 7:17). Some 
MSS. have poidn (masculine), though xu/on is neuter. Twelve 
manner of fruits (karpous dodeka). “Twelve fruits.” Yield- 
ing (apodidoun). Neuter active participle of apodidomi, to 

479 


480 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


give back, but some MSS. have apodidous (masculine) like 
poison. For the healing of the nations (eis therapeian ton 
ethnon). Spiritual healing, of course, as leaves (phulla) are 
often used for obtaining medicines. Here again the prob- 
lem occurs whether this picture is heaven before the judg- 
ment or afterwards. Charles distinguishes sharply between 
the Heavenly City for the millennial reign and the New 
Jerusalem that descends from heaven after the judgment. 
Charles rearranges these chapters to suit his theory. But 
chronology is precarious here. 

3. There shall be no curse any more (pan katathema ouk 
estai eti). No other example of katathema has been found 
outside of the Didache XVI. 5, though the verb katathe- 
matizd occurs in Matt. 26:74, meaning to curse, while we 
have anathematizo in Mark 14:71 in the same sense. It 
may be a syncopated form of katanathema. ‘The usual ana- 
thema (curse) occurs in I Cor. 16:22; Gal. 1:8; Rom. 9:3. 
For pan with ouk =ouden see 21:27. Shall do him service 
(Jatreusousin autoi). Future active of Jatreud, linear idea, 
“shall keep on serving.” See 7:15 for present active in- 
dicative of this same verb with the dative autdi as here, 
picturing the worship of God in heaven. See 27:1 for “the 
throne of God and of the Lamb.” 

4. They shall see his face (opsontai to prosdpon autou). 
Future active of Aorad. This vision of God was withheld 
from Moses (Ex. 33:20, 23), but promised by Jesus to the. 
pure in heart (Matt. 5:8) and mentioned in Heb. 12:14 as 
possible only to the holy, and promised in Ps. 17:15. Even 
here on earth we can see God in the face of Christ (II Cor. 
4:6), but now in the New Jerusalem we can see Christ face 
to face (I Cor. 13:12), even as he is after we are made really 
like him (II Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29; I John 3:2). It is an- 
thropomorphic language, to be sure, but it touches the es- 
sential reality of religion. ‘The supreme felicity is reached, 
immediate presence with God and the Lamb” (Beckwith). 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 481 


His name on their foreheads (to onoma autou epi ton metopon 
auton). As in 3:12; 7:3; 14:1. 

5. Shall be night no more (nux ouk estai eti). As in 21:25. 
They need (echousin chreian). Present active indicative, 
“They have need,” though A has hexousin (shall have), 
future like estai. Here again there is repetition of part of 
21:23, but for the purpose of showing the delightsomeness 
of the New Jerusalem with no need of lamp or sun (change 
to phos with héliou instead of photos, “they have no light 
of sun”). Shall give them light (photisei). Future active of 
photizd, while aorist ephdtisen in 21:23. They shail reign 
(Zasileusousin). Future active of basileus. Reign eternally 
in contrast with the limited millennial reign of 20:4, 6. 
This glorious eternal reign with Christ occurs repeatedly in 
the book (1:6; 3:21; 5:10) as in Luke 22:30. Christ’s King- 
dom is spiritual (John 18:36f.). “The visions of the Apoca- 
lypse are now ended; they have reached their climax in the 
New Jerusalem” (Swete). Now John gives the parting 
utterances of some of the speakers, and it is not always 
clear who is speaking. 

6. He said unto me (eipen moi). Apparently the same 
angel as in 22:1 (21:9, 15). These words (houtoi hoi logoi). 
The same words used in 21:5 by the angel there. Whatever 
the application there, here the angel seems to endorse as 
“faithful and true” (pistoi kai aléthinoi) not merely the 
preceding vision (21:9-22:5), but the revelations of the 
entire book. The language added proves this: ‘‘Sent his 
angel to shew unto his servants the things which must 
shortly come to pass” (apesteilen ton aggelon autou deixat 
tc1s doulois autou ha dei genesthai en tachei), a direct refer- 
ence to I:I concerning the purpose of Christ’s revelation to 
John in this book. For “the God of the spirits of the 
prophets” (ho theos ton pneumaton ton prophéton) see 19:10 
and I Cor. 14:32. Probably the prophets’ own spirits en- 
lightened by the Holy Spirit (10:7; 11:8; 22:9). 


482 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


7. And behold, I come quickly (kai idou erchomai tachu). 
Christ is the speaker, either through this angel or more 
probably directly from Christ without introduction as in 
verses 12, 16. About Christ coming quickly see 2:5, 16; 
3:11; 16:15, and already in 1:2f. Once more we must re- 
call that tachu and en tachei are according to God’s time, 
not ours (II Pet. 3:8). Blessed (makarios). This beatitude 
is like in substance the first (1:3) and is in Christ’s own 
words like the one in 16:15. This book is here called a 
“prophecy” (prophéteias) as in verses 10, 18, Ig. It is 
Christ’s revelation from God, a direct message from God. 
Part of it is prediction of doom on Christ’s enemies, but 
most of it is a comforting picture of final triumph and bliss 
for the faithful in a time of great distress and persecution. 

8. And I Fohn (Kdgo Idannés). Here John the Seer is 
the speaker. He had already given his name (1:1, 4, 9). 
Here he claims to be the “one who hears and sees these 
things” (ho akouon kai blepon tauta). I fell down to worship 
(epesa proskunésai). Second aorist active indicative of pipto 
(with -a form) and the first aorist active infinitive of pur- 
pose of proskuneo. It was a natural, though a wrong, thing 
to do, especially after Christ’s own voice followed that of 
the angel ‘which shewed me these things” (tou deiknuontos 
tauta). Genitive singular of the articular present active 
participle of detknuod. Cf. 1:1; 4:13 17:1; 21:9f.; 22:1, 6. 

g. See thou do it not (Hora mé). The angel promptly in-. 
terposes (/egei, dramatic present). See 19:10 for discussion 
of this same phrase hora mé when John had once before 
started to worship the angel in his excitement. Here we 
have added to the words in 19:10 “‘the prophets (ton pro- 
phéton) and also “them which keep the words of this book”’ 
(ton terounton tous logous tou bibliou toutou), the last a repeti- 
tion from 22:7. In both places we have “‘ Worship God” 
(toi thedi proskunéson}. And not an angel. 

10. And he saith unto me (kai legei moi). The angel re- 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 483 


sumes asin 19:9. Seal not up (mé sphragiséis). Prohibition 
with mé and the ingressive first aorist active subjunctive of 
sphragizo. Charles takes this to be the command of Christ 
because in verses 7 and 18 “the words of the prophecy of 
this book” come from Christ. But that is not a conclusive 
argument, though Charles, as already stated, rearranges 
these chapters to suit his own notion. Once only (10:4) was 
John directed to seal and not to write. See there for dis- 
cussion of sphragizd. This book is to be left open for all 
to read (1:3; 13:18; 17:9; 22:7, 18). dt hand (eggus). 
As in 1:3. 

11. Let him do unrighteousness still (adikésato eti). First 
aorist (constative) active imperative of adiked, viewed here 
as a whole. The language is probably ironical, with a re- 
minder of Dan. 12:10, in no sense a commendation of their 
lost estate. Charles rejects this verse as not like John. It 
is the hopelessness of the final state of the wicked which is 
here pictured. So as to “Let him be made filthy still” 
(rupanthéto eti). First aorist (constative) passive impera- 
tive of rupaind, old verb, to make foul or filthy (from rupos, 
filth, I Pet. 3:21, as is ruparos, filthy), here only in N.T. 
The use of efi is not perfectly clear, whether “still” or “yet 
more.” It is the time when Christ has shut the door to 
those outside who are now without hope (Matt. 25:10; Luke 
13:25). Ruparos occurs elsewhere in N.T. only in James 
2:2, and ruparia (filthiness) only in James 1:21. So then 
“the righteous” (ho dikaios) is to do righteousness still 
(dikaiosunén poiésato eti, first constative aorist active im- 
perative of poied) and “‘the holy” (ho hagios) to be made 
holy still (Aagiasthéto eti, first constative aorist passive im- 
perative of hagiazo). The states of both the evil and the 
good are now fixed forever. There is no word here about a 
“second chance” hereafter. 

12. My reward is with me (ho misthos mou met’ emou). 
It is Christ speaking again and he repeats his promise of 


484 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


coming quickly as in verse 7. He speaks now as the Re- 
warder (ho misthapodotés) of Heb. 11:6. Cf. Rev. 11:18; Is. 
40:10; 62:11. To render (apodounai). Second aorist active 
infinitive of purpose of apodididmi, to give back. Each will 
receive the reward according to his own work (Rev. 2:23; 
II Cor. 5:10; Rom. 2:26). 

13. I am the Alpha and the Omega (Ego to Alpha kai to O). 
Applied to God in 1:8; 21:6, and here alone to Christ, 
crowning proof in this book of Christ’s deity. So in 21:6 
God is termed, as Christ is here, A@ arché kai to telos (the 
beginning and the end), while ho protos kai ho eschatos (the 
first and the last) is applied only to Christ (1:17; 2:8). 
Solemn assurance is thus given that Christ is qualified to 
be the Judge of verse 12 (cf. Matt. 25:31-46). In Heb. 12:2 
Jesus is the archégos kai teleiotés t@s pisteds (the author and 
finisher of faith). Christ was the Creator of the universe 
for the Father. So now he is the Consummation of redemp- 
tion. 

14. Blessed (makarioi). This is the last beatitude of the 
book and “deals with the issues of the higher life’ (Swete). 
They that wash their robes (hoi plunontes tas stolas auton). 
Present active articular participle of plund. See 7:14 for 
this very verb with sto/as, while in 3:4 the negative statement 
occurs. Cf. I Cor. 6:11. That they may have the right (hina 
estat hé exousia auton). Purpose clause with hina and the 
future middle of eimi (a common construction in this book, 
6:4, II; 9:5, 20; 13:12; 14:13), ‘‘that there may be their 
right.” To come to the tree of life (epi to xulon tés 208s). 
“Over the tree of life.”” On exousia epi =“ power over” see 
6:8; 13:7; 16:9; Luke g:1. On “the tree of life” see 2:7; 
22:2. May enter in (eiselthosin). Purpose clause with hina 
and the second aorist active subjunctive of eiserchomai par- 
allel with hina estai (future). By the gates (tois puldsin). 
Associative instrumental case of pulon (21:12), “‘by the gate 
towers.” 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 485 


15. Without (exo). Outside the holy city, with which com- 
pare 21:8, 27. Diuistierdieck supplies an imperative: “Out, 
ye dogs.” The dogs (hoi kunes). Not literal dogs, but the 
morally impure (Deut. 23:18; II Kings 8:13; Ps. 22:17, 21; 
Matt. 7:6; Mark 7:27; Phil. 3:3). Dogs in the Oriental 
cities are the scavengers and excite unspeakable contempt. 
The sorcerers (hoi pharmakoi). As in 21:8, where are listed 
“the fornicators and the murderers and the idolaters,” all 
“outside” the holy city here as there “in the lake that 
burns with fire and brimstone, the second death.” Both are 
pictures (symbolic language) of hell, the eternal absence 
from fellowship with God. Another time Jesus spoke of 
“the outer darkness” (eis to skotos to exdteron, Matt. 8:12; 
22:13; 25:30), outside of lighted house, as the abode of the 
damned. Another symbol is the worm that dies not (Mark 
9:48). Every one that loveth and maketh a lie (pas philon kai 
potion pseudos). An interpretation of pasin tois pseudesin 
(all liars) of 21:8 and of poidn pseudos (doing a lie) of 21:27. 
Satan is the father of lying (John 8:44) and Satan’s home 
is a congenial place for those who love and practise lying 
(II Thess. 2:12). See I John 1:6 for not doing the truth and 
see also Rom. 1:25; Eph. 4:25. 

16. I Fesus (Ego [ésous). The last and most solemn at- 
testation to the book that from Jesus (the historic Jesus 
known to the churches), in harmony with 1:1f. Have sent 
(epempsa). First aorist active indicative of pempo, used 
here in the same sense as aposteilas in 1:1 as his personal 
messenger. It is the Jesus of history here speaking, who 
is also the Christ of theology and the Lamb of God. For 
the churches (epi tais ekklésiais). For this use of epi see 
10:11; John 12:16. It is not just for the seven churches 
(1:4), but for all the churches in the world then and now. 
I am the root and the offspring of David (Ego eimi hé riza 
kai to genos Daueid). See 5:5 for ‘“‘the root of David,” to 
which John now adds ¢o genos in the sense of “offspring” 


486 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


(Acts 17:28f.), not of family or race (Acts 4:6; 7:13). Cf. 
Matt. 22:42-45. The bright, the morning star (ho aster ho 
lampros ho proinos). The Davidic King is called a star in 
Numb. 24:17; Luke 1:78. This “day-star” (phdsphoros) 1s 
interpreted as Christ (II Pet. 1:19). In Rev. 2:28 the phrase 
“the morning star” occurs in Christ’s words, which is here 
interpreted. Christ is the Light that was coming into the 
world (John 1:9; 8:12). 

17. The Spirit and the bride (to pneuma kai hé numphé). 
The Holy Spirit, speaking through the prophets or the Spirit 
of prophecy (2:7; 16:4; 18:24), joins with the bride (21 22), 
the people of God, in a response to the voice of Jesus just 
heard. After the picture of heaven in 22:1-5 there is in- 
tense longing (19:7) of God’s people for the consummation 
of the marriage of the Lamb and the Bride. So now “the 
prophets and the saints” (Swete) make a common plea to 
the Lord Jesus to “come” (Erchou, present middle impera- 
tive of erchomai, Come on) as he has just said twice that 
he would do (22:1, 12). The call for Christ is to be repeated 
by every hearer (40 akoudn) asin 1:3. Let him come (erches- 
tho). Change of person and this verb applied not to Christ 
as just before, but to the one who wishes to greet Christ. 
The thirsty man is bidden to come himself before it is too 
late. See 5:6 for dipsad, used for spiritual thirst, and in 
particular John 6:35 and 7:37 for one thirsting for the water 
of life (21:6; 22:1). Cf. Is. 55:1. He that will (ho thelon). 
Even if not yet eagerly thirsting. This one is welcome also. 
For this use of ¢helo see Phil. 2:13. Let him take (labeto). 
Second ingressive aorist active imperative of lamband. In 
accordance with the free promise in 21:6, “freely” (dorean) 
here as there. This gracious and wide invitation is cheering 
after the gloomy picture of the doomed and the damned. 
The warnings against the dragon and the two beasts with 
all their dreadful consequences are meant to deter men from 
falling victims to all the devil’s devices then and now. The 


THE REVELATION OF JOHN 487 


door of mercy still stands wide open today, for the end has 
not yet come. The series of panoramas is over, with the 
consummation pictured as.a reality. Now we drop back to 
the standpoint before we saw the visions through John’s 
eyes. In verse 17 we hear the voice of the Spirit of God in- 
viting all who hear and see to heed and to come and drink 
of the water of life freely offered by the Lamb of God. 

18. J testify (Egé marturo). Commentators disagree keenly 
about the words in verses 18 and 19. Charles rejects them 
as an interpolation and out of harmony with the rest of the 
book. Beckwith takes them to be John’s own warning, 
drawn from Deut. 4:2 “to every man that heareth” (panti 
tot akouonti, dative of the articular present active participle 
of akoud, which compare 1:3). Swete properly holds these 
verses to be from Jesus himself, still bearing solemn witness 
to this book, with warning against wilful perversion of its 
teachings. If any man shall add (ean tis epith?i). Condi- 
tion of the third class with ean and the second aorist active 
subjunctive of epitithémi, with epi added with auta, as also 
in the conclusion epithései ep’ auton (future active). This 
warning is directed against perversions of this book, not 
about the New Testament or the Bible as a whole, though 
it may be true there also. Surely no warning was more 
needed when we consider the treatment accorded the Apoca- 
lypse, so that Dr. Robert South said that the Apocalypse 
either found one crazy or left him so. 

19. If any man shall take away (ean tis apheléi). Also 
condition of the third class with ean and second aorist ac- 
tive subjunctive of aphaired, with apo repeated both in the 
condition and in the conclusion (aphelei apo, future active 
indicative of aphaired for the more usual aphairései). Which 
are written in this book (ton gegrammenon en toi biblidi toutoi). 
Ablative neuter plural articular perfect passive participle in 
apposition with ek tou xulou tés z0es (from the tree of life) 


488 WORD PICTURES IN NEW TESTAMENT 


and ek tés poleds tes hagias (out of the holy city). Such a 
man is unworthy of his inheritance. 

20. He which testifieth (ho marturon). That is Jesus (1:2) 
who has just spoken (22:18). Yea: I come quickly (Nat, 
erchomai tachu). Affirmation again of the promise in 22:7, 
12. On Nai (Yes) see 1:7 for the Lord’s assent to the call. 
Then John expresses his absolute belief in the Lord’s prom- 
ise: “Amen: come, Lord Jesus” (4mén, erchou, Kurie I@sou). 
On Amén see 1:7. On erchou see 22:17. Note Kurie with 
Tésou. As in I Cor. 12:3; Phil. 2:11. For Paul’s confidence 
in the deity of Christ and the certainty of his second com- 
ing see Titus 2:13 and II Tim. 4:8. Marana tha (I Cor. 
16:22); 

a1. The grace of the Lord Fesus be with the saints (hé charis 
tou Kuriou I@sou meta ton hagion). John’s own benediction, 
an unusual ending for an apocalypse, but suitable for one 
meant to be read in the churches (1:3f.). Grace is Paul’s 
unvarying word in conclusion of his letters, as is true of 
Heb. 13:25. “‘The saints” or the consecrated (hot hagiot) 
is John’s constant word for believers in Christ (8:3f.; 11:18; 
13:7, 10; 14:12; 16:6; 17:6; 18:20, 24; 19:8; 20:9). It is a 
good word for the close of this marvellous picture of God’s 
gracious provision for his people in earth and heaven.

A. T. Robertson 


A. T. RoBErRTSON, professor of inter- 
pretation of the Greek New Testament: 
at Southern Baptist Theological Semi- 
nary for nearly a half century, was one 
of the most brilliant and popular Bible 
scholars of his day. 

A world-famous authority on the 
Greek New Testament, Dr. Robertson 
was a powerful preacher and lecturer, 
and a prolific writer with forty-five vol- 
umes on both popular and profound 
subjects to his credit. A Grammar of 
the Greek New Testament in the Light 
of Historical Research was his greatest 
contribution to the serious Bible stu- 
dent, but his many more concise New 
Testament interpretations have been 
equally helpful to the average Chris- 
tian. 

Among his most popular works are: 
A Harmony of the Gospels for Students 
of the Life of Christ, Paul and the In- 
tellectuals, Studies in Mark’s Gospel, 
Studies in the Epistle of James, Epochs 
in the Life of Jesus, and Epochs in the 
Life of Paul. 


Other Aids in 
New Testament Study 


JESUS AND HIS TEACHINGS 
Fred L. Fisher 


Quite aware of the views of some scholars, Dr. Fisher develops 
a strong case for the reliability of the Gospels and their portrait 
of Jesus. He compresses the teachings of Jesus into three well- 
argued chapters. 


PAUL AND HIS TEACHINGS 
Fred L. Fisher 


Revealing both his indebtedness to some New Testament 
scholars on Paul and his disagreement with others, Dr. Fisher 
provides a well-balanced interpretation of Paul, the man and 
the Christian interpreter. 


NEW TESTAMENT THEOLOGY 
Frank Stagg 


This study emphasizes the New Testament’s unity of thought 
and defines its basic concern as proclaiming the story of sal- 
vation. Dealing with various New Testament theological ques- | 
tions—Christ, salvation, the church, ordinances, eschatology, and 
others—Dr. Stagg gives fresh meaning and understanding of 
the Bible for today. 


THE NEW TESTAMENT WORLD 
H. E. Dana 


Pictures the life and world in the days of Jesus and Paul. 
Briefly sets forth the Jewish thinking and writing, the political 
parties, institutions, home life, and other pertinent aspects of 
that day. Also contains a good summary of the two great streams 
of thought during the time—Judaism and Hellenism.

IN  THE 
NEW  TESTAMENT 

A.  T.  Robertson 


This  six-volume  commentary  on  the 
New  Testament  was  published  in 
1930-33.  Ministers  and  other  Bible  stu- 
dents still  acclaim  it  for  combining 
thorough  scholarship  with  teaching 
skill  and  insight. 

"It  is  a  verse  by  verse  commentary 
on  the  English  text  (with  the  corre- 
sponding Greek  in  English  letters) 
stressing  those  meaningful  and  picto- 
rial suggestions  which  are  often  im- 
plicit in  the  original  significance  of 
the  words  but  are  lost  in  translation. 
.  .  .  The  author  makes  available  for 
those  who  do  not  know  Greek  a  large 
amount  of  critical  and  exegetical  ma- 
terial and  of  interpretative  insight  di- 
rectly connected  with  studies  in  the 
original  text." — The  Christian  Century 

Dr.  Robertson's  scholarship  was  at 
all  times  unimpeachable,  his  spiritual 
insight  was  profound,  and  his  style  was 
of  the  highest  order.  His  genial  wit,  his 
human  touch  and  interest,  and  his 
unique  phrasing  carry  an  appeal  for 
every  reader.

BY  WAY  OF  INTRODUCTION 

There  is  not  room  here  for  a  full  discussion  of  all  the  in- 
teresting problems  raised  by  Luke  as  the  author  of  the 
Gospel  and  Acts.  One  can  find  them  ably  handled  in  the 
Introduction  to  Plummer's  volume  on  Luke's  Gospel  in  the 
International  and  Critical  Commentary,  in  the  Introduction 
to  Ragg's  volume  on  Luke's  Gospel  in  the  Westminster  Com- 
mentaries, in  the  Introduction  to  Easton's  Gospel  According 
to  St.  Luke,  Hayes'  Synoptic  Gospels  and  the  Book  of  Acts, 
Ramsay's  Luke  the  Physician,  Harnack's  Date  of  the  Acts  and 
the  Synoptic  Gospels,  Foakes-Jackson  and  Kirsopp  Lake's 
Beginnings  of  Christianity,  Carpenter's  Christianity  Ac- 
cording to  St.  Luke,  Cadbury's  The  Making  of  Luke-Acts, 
McLachlan's  St.  Luke:  The  Man  and  His  Work,  Robertson's 
Luke  the  Historian  in  the  Light  of  Research,  to  go  no  further. 
It  is  a  fascinating  subject  that  appeals  to  scholars  of  all 
shades  of  opinion. 

The  Same  Author  for  Gospel  and  Acts 

The  author  of  Acts  refers  to  the  Gospel  specifically  as  "the 
first  treatise,"  ton  proton  logon,  (Acts  1:1)  and  both  are 
addressed  to  Theophilus  (Luke  1:3;  Acts  1:1).  He  speaks 
of  himself  in  both  books  as  "me"  (kamoi,  Luke  1:3)  and 
/  made  (epoiesamen,  Acts  1:1).  He  refers  to  himself  with 
others  as  "we"  and  "us"  as  in  Acts  16:10,  the  "we"  sections 
of  Acts.  The  unity  of  Acts  is  here  assumed  until  the  author- 
ship of  Acts  is  discussed  in  Volume  III.  The  same  style  ap- 
pears in  Gospel  and  Acts,  so  that  the  presumption  is  strongly 
in  support  of  the  author's  statement.  It  is  quite  possible  that 
the  formal  Introduction  to  the  Gospel  (1  n-4)  was  intended  to 


viii  BY  WAY  OF  INTRODUCTION 

apply  to  the  Acts  also  which  has  only  an  introductory  clause. 
Plummer  argues  that  to  suppose  that  the  author  of  Acts  im- 
itated the  Gospel  purposely  is  to  suppose  a  literary  miracle. 
Even  Cadbury,  who  is  not  convinced  of  the  Lucan  author- 
ship, says:  "In  my  study  of  Luke  and  Acts,  their  unity  is  a 
fundamental  and  illuminating  axiom."  He  adds:  "They 
are  not  merely  two  independent  writings  from  the  same  pen; 
they  are  a  single  continuous  work.  Acts  is  neither  an  ap- 
pendix nor  an  afterthought.  It  is  probably  an  integral  part 
of  the  author's  original  plan  and  purpose." 

The  Author  of  Acts  a  Companion  of  Paul 

The  proof  of  this  position  belongs  to  the  treatment  of 
Acts,  but  a  word  is  needed  here.  The  use  of  "we"  and  "us" 
in  Acts  16:10  and  from  20:6  to  the  end  of  chapter  28  shows 
it  beyond  controversy  if  the  same  man  wrote  the  "we" 
sections  and  the  rest  of  the  Acts.  This  proof  Harnack  has 
produced  with  painstaking  detail  in  his  Date  of  the  Acts  and 
the  Synoptic  Gospels  and  in  his  volume  The  Acts  of  the  Apostles 
aoid.  u>  lus  Luke  the  Physician. 

This  Companion  of  Paul  a  Physician 

The  argument  for  this  position  lies  in  the  use  of  medical 
terms  throughout  the  Gospel  and  the  Acts.  Hobart  in  his 
Medical  Language  of  St.  Luke  proves  that  the  author  of  both 
Gospel  and  Acts  shows  a  fondness  for  medical  terms  best 
explained  by  the  fact  that  he  was  a  physician.  Like  most 
enthusiasts  he  overdid  it  and  some  of  his  proof  does  not 
stand  the  actual  test  of  sifting.  Harnack  and  Hawkins 
in  his  Horae  Synopticae  have  picked  out  the  most  pertinent 
items  which  will  stand.  Cadbury  in  his  Style  and  Literary 
Method  of  Luke  denies  that  Luke  uses  Greek  medical 
words  more  frequently  in  proportion  than  Josephus,  Philo, 
Plutarch,  or  Lucian.     It  is  to  miss  the  point  about  Luke 


BY  WAY  OF  INTRODUCTION  ix 

merely  to  count  words.  It  is  mainly  the  interest  in  medical 
things  shown  in  Luke  and  Acts.  The  proof  that  Luke  is  the 
author  of  the  books  does  not  turn  on  this  fact.  It  is  merely 
confirmatory.  Paul  calls  Luke  "the  beloved  physician" 
{ho  iatros  ho  agapetos,  Col.  4:14),  "my  beloved  physician." 
Together  they  worked  in  the  Island  of  Malta  (Acts  28:8-10) 
where  many  were  healed  and  Luke  shared  with  Paul  in  the 
appreciation  of  the  natives  who  "came  and  were  healed 
{etherapeuonto)  who  also  honoured  us  with  many  honours." 
The  implication  there  is  that  Paul  wrought  miracles  of  heal- 
ing (iasato),  while  Luke  practised  his  medical  art  also.  Other 
notes  of  the  physician's  interest  will  be  indicated  in  the  dis- 
cussion of  details  like  his  omitting  Mark's  apparent  discredit 
of  physicians  (Mark  5:26)  by  a  milder  and  more  general 
statement  of  a  chronic  case  (Luke  8:43). 

This   Companion  and  Author  Luke 

All  the  Greek  manuscripts  credit  the  Gospel  to  Luke  in 
the  title.  We  should  know  that  Luke  wrote  these  two  books 
if  there  was  no  evidence  from  early  writers.  Irenaeus  defi- 
nitely ascribes  the  Gospel  to  Luke  as  does  Clement  of 
Alexandria,  Tertullian,  the  Muratorian  Fragment.  Plum- 
mer  holds  that  the  authorship  of  the  four  great  Epistles  of 
Paul  (I  and  II  Corinthians,  Galatians,  Romans)  which  even 
Baur  accepted,  is  scarcely  more  certain  than  the  Lukan 
authorship  of  the  Gospel.  Even  Renan  says:  "There  is 
no  very  strong  reason  for  supposing  that  Luke  was  not  the 
author  of  the  Gospel  which  bears  his  name." 

A  Sketch  of  Luke 

His  name  is  not  a  common  one,  and  is  probably  a  short- 
ened form  of  Lukios  and  Lukanos.  Some  of  the  manuscripts 
of  the  Gospel  actually  have  as  the  title  Kata  Lukanon. 
Dean  Plumptre  suggests  that  the  Latin  poet  Lucanus  was 


x  BY  WAY  OF  INTRODUCTION 

named  after  Luke  who  probably  was  the  family  physician 
when  he  was  born.  That  is  conjecture  as  well  as  the  notion 
of  Hayes  that,  since  the  brothers  Gallio  and  Seneca  were 
uncles  of  Lucanus  they  were  influenced  by  Luke  to  be 
friendly  toward  Paul  both  in  Corinth  and  in  Rome.  It  is 
probable  that  Luke  was  a  Greek,  certainly  a  Gentile,  pos- 
sibly a  freedman.  So  this  man  who  wrote  more  than  one- 
fourth  of  the  New  Testament  was  not  a  Jew.  It  is  not  cer- 
tain whether  his  home  was  in  Antioch  or  in  Philippi.  It  is 
also  uncertain  whether  he  was  already  converted  when 
Paul  met  him  at  Troas.  The  Codex  Bezae  has  a  "we" 
passage  after  Acts  1 1 :27  which,  if  genuine,  would  bring  Luke 
in  contact  with  Paul  before  Troas.  Hayes  thinks  that  he 
was  a  slave  boy  in  the  family  of  Theophilus  at  Antioch, 
several  conjectures  in  one.  We  do  not  know  that  Theophilus 
lived  at  Antioch.  It  may  have  been  Rome.  But,  whether 
one  of  Paul's  converts  or  not,  he  was  a  loyal  friend  to 
Paul.  If  he  lived  at  Antioch,  he  could  have  studied  medicine 
there  and  the  great  medical  temple  of  Aesculapius  was  at 
Aegae,  not  far  away.  As  a  Greek  physician,  Luke  was  a 
university  man  and  in  touch  with  the  science  of  his  day. 
Greek  medicine  is  the  beginning  of  the  science  of  medicine 
as  it  is  known  today.  Tradition  calls  him  a  painter,  but  of 
that  we  know  nothing.  Certainly  he  was  a  humanist  and  a 
man  of  culture  and  broad  sympathies  and  personal  charm. 
He  was  the  first  genuine  scientist  who  faced  the  problem 
of  Christ  and  of  Christianity.  It  must  be  said  of  him  that 
he  wrote  his  books  with  open  mind  and  not  as  a  credulous 
enthusiast. 

The  Date  of  the  Gospel 

There  are  two  outstanding  facts  to  mark  off  the  date  of 
this  Gospel  by  Luke.  It  was  later  than  the  Gospel  of  Mark 
since  Luke  makes  abundant  use  of  it.  It  was  before  the  Acts 
of  the  Apostles  since  he  definitely  refers  to  it  in  Acts  1:1. 


BY  WAY  OF  INTRODUCTION  xi 

Unfortunately  the  precise  date  of  both  termini  is  uncertain. 
There  are  stili  some  scholars  who  hold  that  the  author  of  the 
Acts  shows  knowledge  of  the  Antiquities  of  Josephus  and  so 
is  after  a.d.  85,  a  mistaken  position,  in  my  opinion,  but  a 
point  to  be  discussed  when  Acts  is  reached.  Still  others 
more  plausibly  hold  that  the  Acts  was  written  after  the  de- 
struction of  Jerusalem  and  that  the  Gospel  of  Luke  has  a 
definite  allusion  to  that  event  (Luke  2i:2of.),  which  is  in- 
terpreted as  a  prophecy  post  eventum  instead  of  a  prediction 
by  Christ  a  generation  beforehand.  Many  who  accept  this 
view  hold  to  authorship  of  both  Acts  and  Gospel  by  Luke. 
I  have  long  held  the  view,  now  so  ably  defended  by  Harnack, 
that  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles  closes  as  it  does  for  the  simple 
and  obvious  reason  that  Paul  was  still  a  prisoner  in  Rome. 
Whether  Luke  meant  the  Acts  to  be  used  in  the  trial  in 
Rome,  which  may  or  may  not  have  come  to  pass,  is  not  the 
point.  Some  argue  that  Luke  contemplated  a  third  book 
which  would  cover  the  events  of  the  trial  and  Paul's  later 
career.  There  is  no  proof  of  that  view.  The  outstanding 
fact  is  that  the  book  closes  with  Paul  already  a  prisoner  for 
two  years  in  Rome.  If  the  Acts  was  written  about  a.d.  63, 
as  I  believe  to  be  the  case,  then  obviously  the  Gospel  comes 
earlier.  How  much  before  we  do  not  know.  It  so  happens 
that  Paul  was  a  prisoner  a  little  over  two  years  in  Caesarea. 
That  period  gave  Luke  abundant  opportunity  for  the  kind 
of  research  of  which  he  speaks  in  Luke  1:1-4.  In  Palestine 
he  could  have  access  to  persons  familiar  with  the  earthly 
life  and  teachings  of  Jesus  and  to  whatever  documents  were 
already  produced  concerning  such  matters.  Luke  may 
have  produced  the  Gospel  towards  the  close  of  the  stay  of 
Paul  in  Caesarea  or  during  the  early  part  of  the  first  Roman 
imprisonment,  somewhere  between  a.d.  59  and  62.  The 
other  testimony  concerns  the  date  of  Mark's  Gospel  which 
has  already  been  discussed  in  volume  I.  There  is  no  real 
difficulty  in  the  way  of  the  early  date  of  Mark's  Gospel. 


xii  BY  WAY  OF  INTRODUCTION 

All  the  facts  that  are  known  admit,  even  argue  for  a  date  by 
a.d.  60.  If  Mark  wrote  his  Gospel  in  Rome,  as  is  possible, 
it  would  certainly  be  before  a.d.  64,  the  date  of  the  burning 
of  Rome  by  Nero.  There  are  scholars,  however,  who  argue 
for  a  much  earlier  date  for  his  gospel,  even  as  early  as  a.d. 
50.  The  various  aspects  of  the  Synoptic  problem  are  ably 
discussed  by  Hawkins  in  his  Horae  Synopticae,  by  Sanday 
and  others  in  Oxford  Studies  in  the  Synoptic  Problem,  by 
Streeter  in  his  The  Four  Gospels,  by  Hayes  in  his  The  Synop- 
tic Gospels  and  the  Book  of  Acts,  by  Harnack  in  his  Date  of 
the  Acts  and  the  Synoptic  Gospels,  by  Stanton  in  his  The 
Gospels  as  Historical  Documents,  and  by  many  others.  My 
own  views  are  given  at  length  in  my  Studies  in  Mark's 
Gospel  and  in  Luke  the  Historian  in  the  Light  of  Research. 

The   Sources   of  the  Gospel 

In  his  Preface  or  Prologue  (1:1-4)  the  author  tells  us  that 
he  had  two  kinds  of  sources,  oral  and  written,  and  that  they 
were  many,  how  many  we  have  no  way  of  telling.  It  is  now 
generally  accepted  that  we  know  two  of  his  written  sources, 
Mark's  Gospel  and  Q  or  the  Logia  of  Jesus  (written  by 
Matthew,  Papias  says).  Mark  is  still  preserved  and  it  is 
not  difficult  for  any  one  by  the  use  of  a  harmony  of  the  Gos- 
pels to  note  how  Luke  made  use  of  Mark,  incorporating 
what  he  chose,  adapting  it  in  various  ways,  not  using  what 
did  not  suit  his  purposes.  The  other  source  we  only  know 
in  the  non-Markan  portions  of  Matthew  and  Luke,  that  is 
the  material  common  to  both,  but  not  in  Mark.  This  also 
can  be  noted  by  any  one  in  a  harmony.  Only  it  is  probable 
that  this  source  was  more  extensive  than  just  the  portions 
used  by  both  Matthew  and  Luke.  It  is  probable  that  both 
Matthew  and  Luke  each  used  portions  of  the  Logia  not  used 
by  the  other.  But  there  is  a  large  portion  of  Luke's  Gospel 
which  is  different  from  Mark  and  Matthew.  Some  scholars 
call  this  source  L.    There  is  little  doubt  that  Luke  had  an- 


BY  WAY  OF  INTRODUCTION  xin 

other  document  for  the  material  peculiar  to  him,  but  it  is 
also  probable  that  he  had  several  others.  He  spoke  of 
"many."  This  applies  especially  to  chapters  9  to  21.  But 
Luke  expressly  says  that  he  had  received  help  from  "eye- 
witnesses and  ministers  of  the  word,"  in  oral  form  this 
means.  It  is,  then,  probable  that  Luke  made  numerous 
notes  of  such  data  and  used  them  along  with  the  written 
sources  at  his  command.  This  remark  applies  particularly 
to  chapters  1  and  2  which  have  a  very  distinct  Semitic 
(Aramaic)  colouring  due  to  the  sources  used.  It  is  possible, 
of  course,  that  Mary  the  mother  of  Jesus  may  have  written 
a  statement  concerning  these  important  matters  or  that 
Luke  may  have  had  converse  with  her  or  with  one  of  her 
circle.  Ramsay,  in  his  volume,  Was  Christ  Born  at  Bethlehem? 
shows  the  likelihood  of  Luke's  contact  with  Mary  or  her 
circle  during  these  two  years  at  Caesarea.  Luke  handles 
the  data  acquired  with  care  and  skill  as  he  claims  in  his  Pro- 
logue and  as  the  result  shows.  The  outcome  is  what  Renan 
called  the  most  beautiful  book  in  the  world. 

The  Character  of  the  Book 

Literary  charm  is  here  beyond  dispute.  It  is  a  book  that 
only  a  man  with  genuine  culture  and  literary  genius  could 
write.  It  has  all  the  simple  grace  of  Mark  and  Matthew 
plus  an  indefinable  quality  not  in  these  wonderful  books. 
There  is  a  delicate  finish  of  detail  and  proportion  of  parts 
that  give  the  balance  and  poise  that  come  only  from  full 
knowledge  of  the  subject,  the  chief  element  in  a  good  style 
according  to  Dr.  James  Stalker.  This  scientific  physician, 
this  man  of  the  schools,  this  converted  Gentile,  this  devoted 
friend  of  Paul,  comes  to  the  study  of  the  life  of  Christ  with 
a  trained  intellect,  with  an  historian's  method  of  research, 
with  a  physician's  care  in  diagnosis  and  discrimination,  with 
a  charm  of  style  all  his  own,  with  reverence  for  and  loyalty 
to  Jesus  Christ  as  Lord  and  Saviour.    One  could  not  afford 


xiv  BY  WAY  OF  INTRODUCTION 

to  give  up  either  of  the  Four  Gospels.  They  each  supple- 
ment the  other  in  a  wonderful  way.  John's  Gospel  is  the 
greatest  book  in  all  the  world,  reaching  the  highest  heights 
of  all.  But  if  we  had  only  Luke's  Gospel,  we  should  have 
an  adequate  portrait  of  Jesus  Christ  as  Son  of  God  and  Son 
of  Man.  If  Mark's  is  the  Gospel  for  the  Romans  and 
Matthew's  for  the  Jews,  the  Gospel  of  Luke  is  for  the  Gen- 
tile world.  He  shows  the  sympathy  of  Jesus  for  the  poor 
and  the  outcast.  Luke  understands  women  and  children 
and  so  is  the  universal  Gospel  of  mankind  in  all  phases  and 
conditions.  It  is  often  called  the  Gospel  of  womanhood,  of 
infancy,  of  prayer,  of  praise.  We  have  in  Luke  the  first 
Christian  hymns.  With  Luke  we  catch  some  glimpses  of 
the  child  Jesus  for  which  we  are  grateful.  Luke  was  a  friend 
and  follower  of  Paul,  and  verbal  parallels  with  Paul's  Epistles 
do  occur,  but  there  is  no  Pauline  propaganda  in  the  Gospel 
as  Moffatt  clearly  shows  (Intr.  to  Lit.  of  the  N.T.,  p.  281). 
The  Prologue  is  in  literary  Koine  and  deserves  comparison 
with  those  in  any  Greek  and  Latin  writers.  His  style  is 
versatile  and  is  often  coloured  by  his  source.  He  was  a  great 
reader  of  the  Septuagint  as  is  shown  by  occasional  Hebraisms 
evidently  due  to  reading  that  translation  Greek.  He  has 
graciousness  and  a  sense  of  humour  as  McLachlan  and  Ragg 
show.  Every  really  great  man  has  a  saving  sense  of  humour 
as  Jesus  himself  had.  Ramsay  dares  to  call  Luke,  as  shown 
by  the  Gospel  and  Acts,  the  greatest  of  all  historians  not 
even  excepting  Thucydides.  Ramsay  has  done  much  to 
restore  Luke  to  his  rightful  place  in  the  estimation  of  modern 
scholars.  Some  German  critics  used  to  cite  Luke  2:1-7  as  a 
passage  containing  more  historical  blunders  than  any  simi- 
lar passage  in  any  historian.  The  story  of  how  papyri  and 
inscriptions  have  fully  justified  Luke  in  every  statement 
here  made  is  carefully  worked  out  by  Ramsay  in  his  various 
books,  especially  in  The  Bearing  of  Recent  Discovery  on  the 
Trustworthiness  of  the  New   Testament.     The  main  feature 


BY  WAY  OF  INTRODUCTION  xv 

of  this  proof  appears  also  in  my  Luke  the  Historian  in  the 
Light  of  Research.  So  many  items,  where  Luke  once  stood 
alone,  have  been  confirmed  by  recent  discoveries  that  the 
burden  of  proof  now  rests  on  those  who  challenge  Luke  in 
those  cases  where  he  still  stands  alone.

THE  GOSPEL 
ACCORDING  TO  LUKE 


CHAPTER  I 

I.  Forasmuch  as  (epeideper).  Here  alone  in  the  N.T., 
though  common  in  literary  Attic.  Appears  in  the  papyri. 
A  triple  compound  [epei  =  since,  de  =  admittedly  true,  per  = 
intensive  particle  to  emphasize  importance).  Many  (polloi). 
How  many  no  one  knows,  but  certainly  more  than  two  or 
three.  We  know  that  Luke  used  the  Logia  of  Jesus  written 
by  Matthew  in  Aramaic  (Papias)  and  Mark's  Gospel.  Un- 
doubtedly he  had  other  written  sources.  Have  taken  in  hand 
(epecheiresan) .  A  literal  translation  of  epicheireo  (from  cheir, 
hand  and  epi,  upon).  Both  Hippocrates  and  Galen  use  this 
word  in  their  introduction  to  their  medical  works.  Here  only 
in  the  N.T.,  though  a  common  literary  word.  Common  in 
the  papyri  for  undertaking  with  no  idea  of  failure  or  blame. 
Luke  does  not  mean  to  cast  reflection  on  those  who  preceded 
him.  The  apocryphal  gospels  were  all  much  later  and  are 
not  in  his  mind.  Luke  had  secured  fuller  information  and 
planned  a  book  on  a  larger  scale  and  did  surpass  them  with 
the  result  that  they  all  perished  save  Mark's  Gospel  and 
what  Matthew  and  Luke  possess  of  the  Logia  of  Jesus. 
There  was  still  room  for  Luke's  book.  That  motive  influ- 
ences every  author  and  thus  progress  is  made.  To  draw  up, 
a  narrative  (anataxasthai  diegesin).  Ingressive  aorist  middle 
infinitive.  This  verb  anataxasthai  has  been  found  only  in 
Plutarch's  Moral.  968  CD  about  an  elephant  "rehearsing" 
by  moonlight  certain  tricks  it  had  been  taught  (Moulton 
and  Milligan,  Vocabulary).  That  was  from  memory  going 
regularly  through  the  thing  again.  But  the  idea  in  the  word 
is  plain  enough.  The  word  is  composed  of  tasso,  a  common 
verb  for  arranging  things  in  proper  order  and  ana,  again. 
Luke  means  to  say  that  those  before  him  had  made  attempts 

3 


4  WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

to  rehearse  in  orderly  fashion  various  matters  about  Christ. 
"The  expression  points  to  a  connected  series  of  narratives 
in  some  order  (taxis),  topical  or  chronological  rather  than 
to  isolated  narratives"  (Bruce).  u  They  had  produced  some- 
thing more  than  mere  notes  or  anecdotes"  (Plummer). 
Die  ge  sis  means  leading  or  carrying  a  thing  through,  not  a 
mere  incident.  Galen  applies  this  word  some  seventy-five 
times  to  the  writing  of  Hippocrates.  Which  have  been  ful- 
filled (ton  peplerophoremenon) .  Perfect  passive  participle 
from  plerophoreo  and  that  from  pleres  (full)  and  phero  (to 
bring).  Hence  to  bring  or  make  full.  The  verb  is  rare  out- 
side of  the  LXX  and  the  N.T.  Papyri  examples  occur  for 
finishing  off  a  legal  matter  or  a  financial  matter  in  full. 
Deissmann  (Light  from  the  Ancient  East,  pp.  86f.)  gives  ex- 
amples from  the  papyri  and  inscriptions  for  completing  a 
task  or  being  convinced  or  satisfied  in  mind.  The  same  am- 
biguity occurs  here.  When  used  of  persons  in  the  N.T.  the 
meaning  is  to  be  convinced,  or  fully  persuaded  (Rom.  4:21; 
14:5;  Heb.  6:11;  10:22).  When  used  of  things  it  has  the 
notion  of  completing  or  finishing  (II  Tim.  4:5,  17).  Luke  is 
here  speaking  of  "matters"  (pragmatbn).  Luke  may  refer 
to  the  matters  connected  with  Christ's  life  which  have  been 
brought  to  a  close  among  us  or  accomplished.  Bruce  argues 
plausibly  that  he  means  fulness  of  knowledge  "concerning 
the  things  which  have  become  widely  known  among  us 
Christians."  In  Col.  2 :2  we  have  "  fulness  of  understanding " 
(ies  plerophorias  tes  suneseos).  In  modern  Greek  the  verb 
means  to  inform.  The  careful  language  of  Luke  here  really 
pays  a  tribute  to  those  who  had  preceded  him  in  their  narra- 
tives concerning  Christ. 

2.  Even  as  (kathbs).  This  particle  was  condemned  by  the 
Atticists  though  occurring  occasionally  from  Aristotle  on. 
It  is  in  the  papyri.  Luke  asserts  that  the  previous  narratives 
had  their  sound  basis.  Delivered  unto  us  (paredosan  hemin). 
Second  aorist  active  indicative  of  paradidomi.    Luke  received 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  5 

this  tradition  along  with  those  who  are  mentioned  above 
(the  many).  That  is  he  was  not  one  of  the  "eyewitnesses." 
He  was  a  secondary,  not  a  primary,  witness  of  the  events. 
Tradition  has  come  to  have  a  meaning  of  unreliability  with 
us,  but  that  is  not  the  idea  here.  Luke  means  to  say  that  the 
handing  down  was  dependable,  not  mere  wives'  fables.  Those 
who  drew  up  the  narratives  had  as  sources  of  knowledge  those 
who  handed  down  the  data.  Here  we  have  both  written 
and  oral  sources.  Luke  had  access  to  both  kinds.  Which 
from  the  beginning  were  eyewitnesses  and  ministers  of  the  word 
{hoi  ap*  arches  autoptai  kai  huperetai  genomenoi  tou  logon). 
"Who"  is  better  than  "which"  for  the  article  here.  The 
word  for  eyewitnesses  (autoptai)  is  an  old  Greek  word  and 
appears  in  the  papyri  also.  It  means  seeing  with  one's  own 
eyes.  It  occurs  here  only  in  the  N.T.  We  have  the  very 
word  in  the  medical  term  autopsy.  Greek  medical  writers 
often  had  the  word.  It  is  a  different  word  from  epoptai 
(eyewitness)  in  II  Pet.  1  :i6,  a  word  used  of  those  who  be- 
held heavenly  mysteries.  The  word  for  "ministers"  (huper- 
etai), under  rowers  or  servants  we  have  had  already  in  Matt. 
5:25;  26:58;  Mark  14:54,  65,  which  see.  We  shall  see  it  again 
in  Luke  4:20  of  the  attendant  in  the  synagogue.  In  the  sense 
of  a  preacher  of  the  gospel  as  here,  it  occurs  also  in  Acts 
26:16.  Here  "the  word"  means  the  gospel  message,  as  in 
Acts  6:4;  8:4,  etc.  From  the  beginning  apparently  refers  to 
the  beginning  of  the  ministry  of  Jesus  as  was  true  of  the 
apostles  (Acts  1:22)  and  of  the  early  apostolic  preaching 
(Acts  10:37-43).  The  Gospel  of  Mark  follows  this  plan. 
The  Gospel  of  Luke  goes  behind  this  in  chapters  1  and  2  as 
does  Matthew  in  chapters  1  and  2.  But  Luke  is  not  here 
referring  to  himself.  The  matters  about  the  childhood  of 
Jesus  Christ  would  not  form  part  of  the  traditional  preaching 
for  obvious  reasons. 

3.  It  seemed  good  to  me  also  (edoxe  khmoi).     A  natural 
conclusion  and  justification  of  Luke's  decision  to  write  his 


6  WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

narrative.  They  had  ample  reason  to  draw  up  their  narra- 
tives. Luke  has  more  reason  to  do  so  because  of  his  fuller 
knowledge  and  wider  scope.  Having  traced  the  course  of  all 
things  (parekolouthekoti  pdsin) .  The  perfect  active  participle 
of  a  common  verb  of  the  ancient  Greek.  Literally  it  means 
to  follow  along  a  thing  in  mind,  to  trace  carefully.  Both 
meanings  occur  abundantly  in  the  ancient  Greek.  Cadbury 
(Appendix  C  to  Beginnings  of  Christianity,  Vol.  II,  pp.  4891!.) 
objects  to  the  translation  "having  traced"  here  as  implying 
research  which  the  word  does  not  here  mean.  Milligan 
(Vocabulary)  is  somewhat  impressed  by  this  argument.  See 
my  discussion  of  the  point  in  Chapter  XVI  of  Studies  in  the 
Text  of  the  N.T.  (The  Implications  in  Luke's  Preface)  where 
the  point  is  made  that  Luke  here  claims  fulness  of  knowledge 
before  he  began  to  write  his  book.  He  had  the  traditions 
of  the  eyewitnesses  and  ministers  of  the  word  and  the  narra- 
tives previously  drawn  up.  Whether  he  was  a  personal  con- 
temporary with  any  or  all  of  these  events  we  do  not  know 
and  it  is  not  particularly  pertinent.  He  had  mentally  fol- 
lowed along  by  the  side  of  these  events.  Galen  used  this 
verb  for  the  investigation  of  symptoms.  Luke  got  himself 
ready  to  write  before  he  began  by  full  and  accurate  knowl- 
edge of  the  subject.  Akribos  (accurately)  means  going  into 
minute  details,  from  akron,  the  topmost  point.  And  he  did  it 
from  the  first  (anothen).  He  seems  to  refer  to  the  matters  in 
Chapters  1:5  to  2:52,  the  Gospel  of  the  Infancy.  In  order 
(kathexes) .  Chronological  order  in  the  main  following  Ma  rk's 
general  outline.  But  in  9:51  to  18:10  the  order  is  often 
topical.  He  has  made  careful  investigation  and  his  work 
deserves  serious  consideration.  Most  excellent  Theophilus 
(kratiste  Theophile).  The  name  means  god-lover  or  god- 
beloved.  He  may  have  been  a  believer  already.  He  was 
probably  a  Gentile.  Ramsay  holds  that  "most  excellent" 
was  a  title  like  "Your  Excellency"  and  shows  that  he  held 
office,  perhaps  a  Knight.    So  of  Felix  (Acts  23  :26)  and  Festus 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  7 

(Acts  26:25).    The  adjective  does  not  occur  in  the  dedication 
in  Acts  1  :i. 

4.  Mightest  know  {epignbis).  Second  aorist  active  sub- 
junctive of  epiginosko.  Full  knowledge  {epi-)}  in  addition 
to  what  he  already  has.  The  certainty  {ten  asphaleian). 
Make  no  slip  {sphallo,  to  totter  or  fall,  and  a  privative) .  Luke 
promises  a  reliable  narrative.  "Theophilus  shall  know  that 
the  faith  which  he  has  embraced  has  an  impregnable  histor- 
ical foundation"  (Plummer).  The  things  {logon).  Literally 
"words,"  the  details  of  the  words  in  the  instruction.  Wast 
instructed  {katechethes).  First  aorist  passive  indicative.  Not 
in  O.T.  and  rare  in  ancient  Greek.  Occurs  in  the  papyri. 
The  word  echeo  is  our  word  echo  (cf.  I  Thess.  1 :8  for  exechetai, 
has  sounded  forth).  Katecheo  is  to  sound  down,  to  din,  to 
instruct,  to  give  oral  instruction.  Cf.  I  Cor.  14:9;  Acts  21 :2i, 
24;  18:25;  Gal.  6:6.  Those  men  doing  the  teaching  were 
called  catechists  and  those  receiving  it  were  called  catechu- 
mens. Whether  Theophilus  was  still  a  catechumen  is  not 
known.  This  Preface  by  Luke  is  in  splendid  literary  Koine 
and  is  not  surpassed  by  those  in  any  Greek  writer  (Herodo- 
tus, Thucydides,  Polybius).  It  is  entirely  possible  that  Luke 
was  familiar  with  this  habit  of  Greek  historians  to  write 
prefaces  since  he  was  a  man  of  culture. 

5.  There  was  {egeneto).  Not  the  usual  en  for  "was,"  but 
there  arose  or  came  into  notice.  With  this  verse  the  literary 
Koine  of  verses  1  to  4  disappears.  To  the  end  of  chapter  2 
we  have  the  most  Hebraistic  (Aramaic)  passage  in  Luke's 
writings,  due  evidently  to  the  use  of  documents  or  notes  of 
oral  tradition.  Plummer  notes  a  series  of  such  documents 
ending  with  1:80,  2:40,  2:52.  If  the  mother  of  Jesus  was 
still  alive,  Luke  could  have  seen  her.  She  may  have  written 
in  Aramaic  an  account  of  these  great  events.  Natural  re- 
serve would  keep  her  from  telling  too  much  and  from  too 
early  publicity.  Luke,  as  a  physician,  would  take  special 
interest  in  her  birth  report.    The  supernatural  aspects  dis- 


8  WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

turb  only  those  who  do  not  admit  the  real  Incarnation  of 
Jesus  Christ  and  who  are  unable  to  believe  that  God  is  supe- 
rior to  nature  and  that  the  coming  of  the  Son  of  God  to  earth 
justifies  such  miraculous  manifestations  of  divine  power. 
Luke  tells  his  story  from  the  standpoint  of  Mary  as  Matthew 
gives  his  from  the  standpoint  of  Joseph.  The  two  supple- 
ment each  other.  We  have  here  the  earliest  documentary 
evidence  of  the  origins  of  Christianity  that  has  come  down 
to  us  (Plummer).  Herod,  King  of  Judea  (Heroidou  basileos 
tes  Ioudaias).  This  note  of  time  locates  the  events  before 
the  death  of  Herod  the  Great  (as  he  was  called  later),  ap- 
pointed King  of  Judea  by  the  Roman  Senate  B.C.  40  at  the 
suggestion  of  Octavius  and  Antony.  He  died  B.C.  4.  Of 
the  course  of  Abijah  {ex  ephemerias  Abid).  Not  in  old  Greek, 
but  in  LXX  and  modern  Greek.  Papyri  have  a  verb  derived 
from  it,  ephemereo.  Daily  service  (Neh.  13:30;  I  Chron. 
25:8)  and  then  a  course  of  priests  who  were  on  duty  for  a 
week  (I  Chron.  23:6;  28:13).  There  were  24  such  courses 
and  that  of  Abijah  was  the  eighth  (I  Chron.  24:10;  II  Chron. 
8:14).  Only  four  of  these  courses  (Jedaiah,  Immer,  Pashur, 
Harim)  returned  from  Babylon,  but  these  four  were  divided 
into  twenty-four  with  the  old  names.  Each  of  these  courses 
did  duty  for  eight  days,  sabbath  to  sabbath,  twice  a  year. 
On  sabbaths  the  whole  course  did  duty.  At  the  feast  of 
tabernacles  all  twenty-four  courses  were  present.  Of  the 
daughters  of  Aaron  (ek  ton  thugateron  Aaron).  "To  be  a  priest 
and  married  to  a  priest's  daughter  was  a  double  distinction" 
(Plummer) .  Like  a  preacher  married  to  a  preacher's  daughter. 
6.  Righteous  before  God  (dikaioi  enantion  tou  theou).  Old 
Testament  conception  and  idiom.  Cf.  2:25  about  Simeon. 
Expanded  in  Old  Testament  language.  Picture  of  "noblest 
product  of  Old  Testament  education"  (Ragg)  is  Zacharias 
and  Elisabeth,  Mary  and  Joseph,  Simeon  and  Anna  who 
were  "privileged  to  see  with  clear  eyes  the  dawn  of  the  New 
Testament  revelation." 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  9 

7.  Because  that  (kathoti).  Good  Attic  word,  according  to 
what.  Only  in  Luke  and  Acts  in  the  N.T.  In  the  papyri. 
Well  stricken  in  years  (probebekotes  en  tais  hemerais  auton). 
Wycliff  has  it  right:  "Had  gone  far  in  their  days."  Perfect 
active  participle.    See  also  verse  18. 

8.  While  he  executed  the  priest1  s  office  {en  tot  hierateuein 
auton).  A  favourite  idiom  in  Luke,  en  with  the  articular  in- 
finitive and  the  accusative  of  general  reference  where  the 
genitive  absolute  could  have  been  used  or  a  temporal  con- 
junction and  finite  verb.  It  is  proper  Greek,  but  occurs  often 
in  the  LXX,  which  Luke  read,  particularly  in  imitation  of 
the  Hebrew  infinitive  construct.  The  word  hierateuo  does 
not  appear  in  the  ancient  Greek,  but  in  the  LXX  and  this 
one  example  in  Luke.  It  is  on  the  Rosetta  Stone  and  the 
early  inscriptions  so  that  the  word  was  simply  applied  by 
the  LXX  translators  from  current  usage. 

9.  His  lot  was  {elache).  Literally,  he  obtained  the  lot. 
Second  aorist  active  indicative  of  lagchano,  to  obtain  by  lot, 
a  very  old  verb  from  Homer  on.  It  is  used  either  with  the 
genitive  as  here,  or  the  accusative  as  in  Acts  1:17;  II  Pet. 
1:1.  Papyri  show  examples  with  the  accusative.  It  was 
only  once  in  a  lifetime  that  a  priest  obtained  the  lot  of  going 
(eiselthon,  here  nominative  aorist  active  participle  agreeing 
with  the  subject  of  elache)  into  the  sanctuary  (ton  naon,  not 
to  hieron,  the  outer  courts)  and  burning  incense  on  the  golden 
altar.  "It  was  the  great  moment  of  Zacharias's  life,  and  his 
heart  was  no  doubt  alert  for  the  supernatural"  (Ragg).  The 
fortunate  lot  was  "a  white  stone"  to  which  Rev.  2:17  may 
refer.  Burn  incense  (tou  thumiasai).  Here  only  in  the  N.T. 
Occurs  on  inscriptions.  Hobart  finds  it  used  by  medical 
writers  for  fumigating  herbs.  "Ascending  the  steps  to  the 
Holy  Place,  the  priests  spread  the  coals  on  the  golden  altar, 
and  arranged  the  incense,  and  the  chief  operating  priest 
was  then  left  alone  within  the  Holy  Place  to  await  the 
signal  of  the  president  to  burn  the  incense.    It  was  prob-

ably  at  this  time  that  the  angel  appeared  to  Zacharias" 
(Vincent). 

IO.  Were  praying  without  (en  proseuchomenon  exo).  Peri- 
phrastic imperfect  indicative  picturing  the  posture  of  the 
people  while  the  clouds  of  incense  rose  on  the  inside  of  the 
sanctuary. 

ii.  Appeared  (ophthe).  First  aorist  passive  indicative. 
It  is  the  form  used  by  Paul  of  the  resurrection  appearances 
of  Jesus  (I  Cor.  15 15—8).  There  is  no  use  in  trying  to  explain 
away  the  reality  of  the  angel.  We  must  choose  between  ad- 
mitting an  objective  appearance  and  a  myth  (Plummer). 

13.  Is  heard  (eisekousthe) .  First  aorist  passive  indicative. 
A  sort  of  timeless  aorist,  "was  heard"  when  made,  and  so 
"is  heard"  now.  Probably  the  prayer  was  for  a  son  in  spite 
of  the  great  age  of  Elisabeth,  though  the  Messianic  redemp- 
tion is  possible  also.  John  (Ibanen).  The  word  means  that 
God  is  gracious.  The  mention  of  the  name  should  have 
helped  Zacharias  to  believe.  The  message  of  the  angel 
(verses  13  to  17)  takes  on  a  metrical  form  when  turned  into 
Hebrew  (Ragg)  and  it  is  a  prose  poem  in  Greek  and  English 
like  1:30-33,  35-37,  42~45>  46~55>  68-70;  2:10-12,  14,  29-32, 
34-35.  Certainly  Luke  has  preserved  the  earliest  Christian 
hymns  in  their  oldest  sources.  He  is  the  first  critic  of  the 
sources  of  the  Gospels  and  a  scholarly  one. 

14.  Gladness  (agalliasis).  Only  in  the  LXX  and  N.T. 
so  far  as  known.  A  word  for  extreme  exultation.  Rejoice 
(charesontai) .  Second  future  passive  indicative.  The  com- 
ing of  a  prophet  will  indeed  be  an  occasion  for  rejoicing. 

15.  Strong  drink  (sikera).  A  Hebrew  word  transliterated 
into  Greek,  an  intoxicating  drink.  Here  only  in  the  N.T. 
John  was  to  be  a  personal  "dry"  or  Nazarite  (Num.  6:3). 
Shall  not  drink  (ou  me  piei).  Strong  prohibition,  double 
negative  and  second  aorist  subjunctive.  The  Holy  Ghost 
(pneumatos  hagiou).  The  Holy  Spirit  in  contrast  to  the 
physical  excitement  of  strong  drink  (Plummer).    Luke  uses 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  II 

this  phrase  53  times,  12  in  the  Gospel,  Mark  and  John  4 
each,  Matthew  5  times.  Even  from  his  mother's  womb  (eti 
ek  koilias  metros  autou).    A  manifest  Hebraism.    Cf.  verse  41. 

17.  Before  his  face  {enopion  autou).  Not  in  the  ancient 
Greek,  but  common  in  the  papyri  as  in  LXX  and  N.T.  It 
Is  a  vernacular  Koine  word,  adverb  used  as  preposition  from 
adjective  enopios,  and  that  from  ho  en  dpi  on  (the  one  who 
is  in  sight).  Autou  here  seems  to  be  "the  Lord  their  God"  in 
verse  16  since  the  Messiah  has  not  yet  been  mentioned, 
though  he  was  to  be  actually  the  Forerunner  of  the  Messiah. 
In  the  spirit  and  power  of  Elijah  {en  pneumati  kai  dunamei 
Eleia).  See  Isa.  40:1-11;  Mai.  3:1-5.  John  will  deny  that  he 
is  actually  Elijah  in  person,  as  they  expected  (John  1 :2i),  but 
Jesus  will  call  him  Elijah  in  spirit  (Mark  9:12  =  Matt.  17:12). 
Hearts  of  fathers  {kardias  pateron).  Paternal  love  had  died 
out.  This  is  one  of  the  first  results  of  conversion,  the  revival 
of  love  in  the  home.  Wisdom  {phronesei).  Not  sophia,  but  a 
word  for  practical  intelligence.  Prepared  (kateskeuasmenon). 
Perfect  passive  participle,  state  of  readiness  for  Christ.  This 
John  did.  This  is  a  marvellous  forecast  of  the  character  and 
career  of  John  the  Baptist,  one  that  should  have  caught  the 
faith  of  Zacharias. 

18.  Whereby  {kata  ti).  According  to  what.  It  was  too 
good  to  be  true  and  Zacharias  demanded  proof  and  gives  the 
reason  (for,  gar)  for  his  doubt.  He  had  prayed  for  this  bless- 
ing and  was  now  sceptical  like  the  disciples  in  the  house  of 
Mary  about  the  return  of  Peter  (Acts  12:141.). 

19.  Gabriel  {Gabriel).  The  Man  of  God  (Dan.  8:6;  9:21). 
The  other  angel  whose  name  is  given  in  Scripture  is  Michael 
(Dan.  10:13,  21;  Jude  9;  Rev.  12:7).  The  description  of  him- 
self is  a  rebuke  to  the  doubt  of  Zacharias. 

20.  Thou  shalt  be  silent  {esei  siopon).  Volitive  future 
periphrastic.  Not  able  to  speak  {me  dunamenos  lalesai). 
Negative  repetition  of  the  same  statement.  His  dumbness 
will  continue  "until"  {achri  hes  hemer as},  the  events  come  to

pass  "because"  (anth*  hon).    The  words  were  to  become 
reality  in  due  season  (kairon,  not  chronos,  time). 

21.  Were  waiting  (en  prosdokbn).  Periphrastic  imperfect 
again.  An  old  Greek  verb  for  expecting.  Appears  in  papyri 
and  inscriptions.  It  denotes  mental  direction  whether  hope 
or  fear.  They  marvelled  (ethaumazon) .  Imperfect  tense, 
were  wondering.  The  Talmud  says  that  the  priest  remained 
only  a  brief  time  in  the  sanctuary.  While  he  tarried  (en  toi 
chronizein).    See  verse  8  for  the  same  idiom. 

22.  Perceived  (epegnbsan).  Second  aorist  indicative. 
Clearly  knew  because  he  was  not  able  to  pronounce  the 
benediction  from  the  steps  (Num.  6:24-26).  Continued 
making  signs  (en  dianeubn).  Periphrastic  imperfect  again. 
He  nodded  and  beckoned  back  and  forth  (dia,  between). 
Further  proof  of  a  vision  that  caused  his  dumbness. 

23.  Ministration  (leitourgias).  Our  word  liturgy.  A 
common  word  in  ancient  Greek  for  public  service,  work  for 
the  people  (lebs  ergon).  It  is  common  in  the  papyri  for  the 
service  of  the  Egyptian  priesthood  as  we  see  it  in  the  LXX 
of  Hebrew  priests  (see  also  Heb.  8:6;  9:21;  II  Cor.  9:12; 
Phil.  2:17,  30). 

24.  Conceived  (sunelaben).  Luke  uses  this  word  eleven 
times  and  it  occurs  only  five  other  times  in  the  N.T.  It  is 
a  very  old  and  common  Greek  word.  He  alone  in  the  N.T. 
has  it  for  conceiving  offspring  (1:24,  31,  36;  2:21)  though 
James  1:15  uses  it  of  lust  producing  sin.  Hobart  (Medical 
Language  of  Luke,  p.  91)  observes  that  Luke  has  almost  as 
many  words  for  pregnancy  and  barrenness  as  Hippocrates 
(en  gastri  echein,  21 :23 ;  egkuos,  2 :5 ;  steira,  1 :y;  ateknos,  20:28). 
Hid  (periekruben).  Only  here  in  the  N.T.,  but  in  late  KoinS 
writers.  Usually  considered  second  aorist  active  indicative 
from  perikrupto,  though  it  may  be  the  imperfect  indicative 
of  a  late  form  perikrubo.  If  it  is  aorist  it  is  the  constative 
aorist.  The  preposition  peri  makes  it  mean  completely  (on 
all  sides)  hid. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  13 

25.  My  reproach  {oneidos  mou).  Keenly  felt  by  a  Jewish 
wife  because  the  husband  wanted  an  heir  and  because  of 
the  hope  of  the  Messiah,  and  because  of  the  mother's  long- 
ing for  a  child. 

26.  Was  sent  (apestale).  Second  aorist  passive  indicative 
of  apostello  from  which  apostle  comes.  The  angel  Gabriel 
is  God's  messenger  to  Mary  as  to  Zacharias  (1:19). 

27.  Betrothed  (emnesteumenen) .  Perfect  passive  participle. 
Betrothal  usually  lasted  a  year  and  unfaithfulness  on  the 
part  of  the  bride  was  punished  with  death  (Deut.  23:24^). 

28.  Highly  favoured  (kecharitomene).  Perfect  passive  par- 
ticiple of  charitoo  and  means  endowed  with  grace  (charis), 
enriched  with  grace  as  in  Eph.  1 :6,  non  ut  mater  gratiae,  sed 
ut  filia  gratiae  (Bengel).  The  Vulgate  gratiae  plena  "is 
right,  if  it  means  'full  oi_gr^ce^which  thou  hast  received^ ; 
wrong,  if  it  means  full  of  grace  which  thou  hast  to  bestow ' " 
(Plummer).  The  oldest  MSS.  do  not  have  "Blessed  art 
thou  among  women"  here,  but  in  verse  42. 

29.  Cast  in  her  mind  (dielogizeto).  Imperfect  indicative. 
Note  aorist  dietarachthe.  Common _verb__for_  reckoning _up_ 
difiejcentJ^asoJia.    She  was  both  upset  and  puzzled. 

30.  Favour  (charin).  Grace.  Same  root  as  chair 0  (re- 
joice) and  charitoo  in  verse  28.  To  find  favour  is  a  common 
O.T.  phrase.  Charis  is  a  very  ancient  and  common  word 
with  a  variety  of  applied  meanings.  They  all  come  from  the 
notion  of  sweetness,  charm,  loveliness,  joy,  delight,  like 
words  of  grace,  Luke  4:22,  growing  grace,  Eph.  4:29,  with 
grace,  Col.  4:6.  The  notion  of  kindness  is  in  it  also,  especially 
of  God  towards  men  as  here.  It  is  a  favourite  word  for 
Christianity,  the  Gospel  of  the  grace  of  God  (Acts  20:24) 
in  contrast  with  law  or  works  (John  1:16).  Gratitude  is 
expressed  also  (Luke  6:32),  especially  to  God  (Rom.  6:17). 
With  God  (para  toi  thebi).    Beside  God. 

31.  Conceive  in  thy  womb  (sullempsei  en  gastri).  Adding 
en  gastri  to  the  verb  of  1:24.    Same  idiom  in  Isa.  7:14  of 


'

Immanuel.    Jesus  (Iesoun).    As  to  Joseph  in  Matt.  1:21,  but 
without  the  explanation  of  the  meaning.     See  on  Matthew. 

32.  The  Son  of  the  Most  High  (huios  Hupsistou).  There 
is  no  article  in  the  Greek,  but  the  use  of  Most  High  in  verse 
35  clearly  of  God  as  here.  In  Luke  6:35  we  find  "sons  of 
the  Most  High"  (huioi  Hupsistou)  so  that  we  cannot  insist 
on  deity  here,  though  that  is  possible.  The  language  of 
II  Sam.  7:14  and  Isa.  9:7  is  combined  here. 

33.  Shall  be  no  end  (ouk  estai  telos).  Luke  reports  the 
perpetuity  of  this  Davidic  kingdom  over  the  house  of  Jacob 
with  n°  Pauline  interpretatjojiLoi the_spiritual  Israel  though 
that  was  the  true  meaning  as  Luke  knew.  Joseph  was  of 
the  house  of  David  (Luke  1  \2j)  and  Mary  also  apparently 
(Luke  2:5). 

35.  Shall  overshadow  thee  (episkiasei).  A  figure  of  a  cloud 
coming  upon  her.  Common  in  ancient  Greek  in  the  sense  of 
obscuring  and  with  accusative  as  of  Peter's  shadow  in  Acts 
5:15.  But  we  have  seen  it  used  of  the  shining  bright  cloud 
at  the  Transfiguration  of  Jesus  (Matt.  17:5  =  Mark  9:7  = 
Luke  9:34).  Here  it  is  like  the  Shekinah  glory  which  sug- 
gests it  (Ex.  40:38)  where  the  cloud  of  glory  represents  the 
presence  and  power  of  God.  Holy,  the  Son  of  God  (Hagion 
huios  theou).  Here  again  the  absence  of  the  article  makes  it 
possible  for  it  to  mean  "Son  of  God."  See  Matt.  5:9.  But 
this  title,  like  the  Son  of  Man  {Ho  huios  tou  anthrbpou)  was 
a  recognized  designation  of  the  Messiah.  Jesus  did  not 
often  call  himself  Son  of  God  (Matt.  27:43),  but  it  is  as- 
sumed in  his  frequent  use  of  the  Father,  the  Son  (Matt. 
11:27;  Luke  10:21;  John  5:191!.).  It  is  the  title  used  by  the 
Father  at  the  baptism  (Luke  3 :22)  and  on  the  Mount  of 
Transfiguration  (Luke  9:35).  The  wonder  of  Mary  would 
increase  at  these  words.  The  Miraculous  Conception  or 
Virgin  Birth  of  Jesus  is  thus  plainly  set  forth  in  Luke  as  in 
Matthew.  The  fact  that  Luke  was  a  physician  gives  added 
interest  to  his  report.

36.  Kinswoman  (suggenis).  Not  necessarily  cousin,  but 
simply  relative. 

37.  No  word  {ouk  rhema).  Rhema  brings  out  the  single 
item  rather  than  the  whole  content  (logos).    So  in  verse  38. 

39.  Arose  (anastasa).  Luke  is  very  fond  of  this  word, 
sixty  times  against  twenty-two  in  the  rest  of  the  N.T. 
Into  the  hill  country  (eis  ten  orinen).  Luke  uses  this  adjective 
twice  in  this  context  (here  and  1 165)  instead  of  to  oros,  the 
mountains.  It  is  an  old  word  and  is  in  the  LXX,  but  nowhere 
else  in  the  N.T.  The  name  of  the  city  where  Zacharias 
lived  is  not  given  unless  Judah  here  means  Juttah  (Josh. 
15:55).    Hebron  was  the  chief  city  of  this  part  of  Judea. 

40.  Saluted_  (espasato).  Her  first  glance  at  Elisabeth 
showed  the  truth  of  the  angel's  message.  The  two  mothers 
had  a  bond  of  sympathy. 

41.  Leaped  (eskirtesen).  A  common  enough  incident  with 
unborn  children  (Gen.  25:22),  but  Elisabeth  wasfilled-jadth 
the  Holy  Spirit  to  understand  what  had  happened  to  Mary. 

42.  With  a  loud  cry  (kraugei  megalei).  A  moment  of 
ecstatic  excitement.  Blessed  art  thou  (eulogemene) .  Perfect 
passive  participle.  A  Hebraistic  equivalent  for  the  superla- 
tive. 

43.  The  mother  of  my  Lord  (he  meter  tou  Kuriou  mou). 
See  Psa.  110:1.  Only  by  the  help  of  the  Holy  Spirit  could 
Elisabeth  know  that  Mary  was  to  be  the  mother  of  the  Mes- 
siah. 

45.  For  (hoti).  It  is  not  certain  whether  hotihere  is  "that" 
or  "because."  It  makes  good  sense  either  way.  See  also 
7:16.  This  is  the  first  beatitude  in  the  New  Testament  and 
it  is  similar  to  the  last  one  in  the  Gospels  spoken  to  Thomas 
to  discourage  his  doubt  (John  20:29).  Elisabeth  wishes 
Mary  to  have  full  faith  in  the  prophecy  of  the  angel.  This 
song  of  Elisabeth  is  as  real  poetry  as  is  that  of  Mary  (1 147- 
55)  and  Zacharias  (1:68-70).  All  three  spoke  under  the 
power  of  the  Holy  Spirit.    These  are  the  first  New  Testa-

ment  hymns  and  they  are  very  beautiful.  Plummer  notes 
four  strophes  in  Mary's  Magnificat  (46-48,  49  and  50,  51-53, 
54  and  55).  Every  idea  here  occurs  in  the  Old  Testament, 
showing  that  Mary's  mind  was  full  of  the  spiritual  message 
of  God's  word. 

46.  Doth  magnify  (megalunei).  Latin,  magnificat.  Har- 
nack  argues  that  this  is  also  the  song  of  Elisabeth  because 
a  few  Latin  MSS.  have  it  so,  but  Mary  is  correct.  She 
draws  her  material  from  the  O.T.  and  sings  in  the  noblest 
strain. 

47.  Hath  rejoiced  (egalliasen).  This  is  aorist  active  indica- 
tive. Greek  tenses  do  not  correspond  to  those  in  English. 
The  verb  agalliao  is  a  Hellenistic  word  from  the  old  Greek 
agallo.  It  means  to  exult.  See  the  substantive  agalliasis  in 
Luke   1 114,  44.     Mary  is  not  excited  like  Elisabeth,  but 

,  ^breathes  a  spirit  of  composed  rapture.  My  spirit  (to  pneuma 
moil).  One  need  not  press  unduly  the  difference  between 
"soul"  (psuche)  in  verse  46  and  "spirit"  here.  Bruce  calls 
them  synonyms  in  parallel  clauses.  Vincent  argues  that 
the  soul  is  the  principle  of  individuality  while  the  spirit  is 
the  point  of  contact  between  God  and  man.  It  is  doubtful, 
however,  if  the  trichotomous  theory  of  man  (body,  soul, 
and  spirit)  is  to  be  insisted  on.  It  is  certain  that  we  have  an 
inner  spiritual  nature  for  which  various  words  are  used  in 
J  Mark  12:30.  Even  the  distinction  between  intellect,  emo- 
tions, and  will  is  challenged  by  some  psychologists.  God  my 
Saviour  (toi  theoi  tbi  soteri  mou).  Article  with  each  sub- 
stantive. God  is  called  Saviour  in  the  O.T.  (Deut.  32:15, 
Psa.  24:5595:1). 

48.  The  low  estate  {ten  tapeinosin).  The  bride  of  a  car- 
penter and  yet  to  be  the  mother  of  the  Messiah.  Literal 
sense  here  as  in  1 152.  Shall  call  me  blessed  (makariousin  me). 
So-called  Attic  future  of  an  old  verb,  to  felicitate.  Elisabeth 
had  already  given  her  a  beatitude  (makaria,  1 145).  Another 
occurs  in  1 1 127.    But  this  is  a  very  different  thing  from  the

worship  of  Mary  (Mariolatry)  by  Roman  Catholics.     See 
my  The  Mother  of  Jesus:  Her  Problems  and  Her  Glory. 

50.  Fear  (phoboumenois).  Dative  of  the  present  middle 
participle.  Here  it  is  reverential  fear  as  in  Acts  10:2;  Col. 
3 :22.  The  bad  sense  of  dread  appears  in  Matt.  21 46  Mark 
6:20,   Luke    12:4. 

51.  Showed  strength  (epoiesen  kratos).  "Made  might" 
(WyclifT).  A  Hebrew  conception  as  in  Psa.  118:15.  Phim- 
mer  notes  six  aorist  indicatives  in  this  sentence  (51-63), 
neither  corresponding  to  our  English  idiom,  which  translates 
here  by  "hath"  each  time.  Imagination  (dianoiai).  Intel- 
lectual insight,  moral  understanding. 

52.  Princes  {dunastas).  Our  word  dynasty  is  from  this 
word.    It  comes  from  dunamai,  to  be  able. 

54.  Hath  holpen  {antelabeto).  Second  aorist  middle  indica- 
tive. A  very  common  verb.  It  means  to  lay  hold  of  with  a 
view  to  help  or  succour.  Servant  (paidos).  Here  it  means 
"servant,"  not  "son"  or  "child,"  its  usual  meaning. 

58.  Had  magnified  (emegalunen).  Aorist  active  indicative. 
Same  verb  as  in  verse  46.  Rejoiced  with  her  (sunechairon 
auiei) .  Imperfect  tense  and_pictures  the  continual  joy  of 
the  neighbours,  accented  also  by  sun-  (cf.  Phil.  2:18)  in  its 
mutual  aspect. 

59.  Would  have  called  (ekaloun).  Conative  imperfect, 
tried  to  call. 

62.  Made  signs  (eneneuon).  Imperfect  tense,  repeated 
action  as  usual  when  making  signs.  In  1:22  the  verb  used 
of  Zacharias  is  dianeuon.  What  he  would  have  him  called 
(to  ti  an  theloi  kaleisthai  auto) .  Note  article  to  with  the  indi- 
rect question,  accusative  of  general  reference.  The  optative 
with  an  is  here  because  it  was  used  in  the  direct  question 
(cf.  Acts  17:18),  and  is  simply  retained  in  the  indirect. 
What  would  he  wish  him  to  be  called?  (if  he  could  speak),  a 
conclusion  of  the  fourth-class  condition. 

63.  Tablet  (pinakidion) .    Diminutive  of  pinakis.    In  Aris-

totle  and  the  papyri  for  writing  tablet,  probably  covered 
with  wax.  Sometimes  it  was  a  little  table,  like  Shakespeare's 
"the  table  of  my  memory"  (Hamlet,  i.  5).  It  was  used 
also  of  a  physician's  note-book.  Wrote,  saying  {egrapsen 
legon).     Hebrew  way  of  speaking  (II  Kings  10:6). 

64.  Immediately  (parachrema).  Nineteen  times  in  the 
N.T.,  seventeen  in  Luke.  Opened  (aneoichthe).  First  aorist 
passive  indicative  with  double  augment.  The  verb  suits 
"mouth,"  but  not  "tongue"  {gloss a).  It  is  thus  a  zeugma 
with  tongue.    Loosed  or  some  such  verb  to  be  supplied. 

65.  Fear  {phobos).  Not  terror,  but  religious  awe  because 
of  contact  with  the  supernatural  as  in  the  case  of  Zacharias 
(1:12).  Were  noised  abroad  {dielaleito) .  Imperfect  passive. 
Occurs  in  Polybius.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  6:11. 
It  was  continuous  talk  back  and  forth  between  {did)  the 
people. 

66.  What  then  {ti  ard).  With  all  these  supernatural 
happenings  they  predicted  the  marvellous  career  of  this 
child.  Note  Ti,  what,  not  Tis,  who.  Cf.  Acts  12:18.  They 
laid  them  up  {ethento,  second  aorist  middle  indicative)  as 
Mary  did  (2:19).  The  hand  of  the  Lord  {cheir  Kuriou). 
Luke's  explanation  in  addition  to  the  supernatural  events. 
The  expression  occurs  only  in  Luke's  writing  (Acts  11:21, 
13:11). 

67.  Prophesied  {epropheteusen).  Under  the  guidance  of 
the  Holy  Spirit.  This  Benedictus  {Eulogetos,  Blessed)  of 
Zacharias  (68  to  79)  may  be  what  is  referred  to  in  verse  64 
"he  began  to  speak  blessing  God"  {eulogbn).  Nearly  every 
phrase  here  is  found  in  the  O.T.  (Psalms  and  Prophets). 
He,  like  Mary,  was  full  of  the  Holy  Spirit  and  had  caught 
the  Messianic  message  in  its  highest  meaning. 

68.  Hath  visited  {epeskepsato).  An  old  Greek  word  with 
a  Hebraic  colouring  to  look  into  with  a  view  to  help.  The 
papyri  have  plenty  of  examples  of  the  verb  in  the  sense  of 
inspecting,  examining.    Redemption  {lutrbsin)  here  originally 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  19 

referred  to  political  redemption,  but  with  a  moral  and  spirit- 
ual basis  (verses  75,  Jj). 

69.  Horn  of  salvation  (keras  soterias).  A  common  meta- 
phor in  the  O.T.  (I  Sam.  2:10;  II  Sam.  23:3,  etc.).  It  rep- 
resents strength  like  the  horns  of  bulls.    Cf.  Psa.  132:17. 

70.  Since  the  world  began  {ap>  aidnos).  Better  "from  of 
old"  (Weymouth,  American  Revision). 

73.  The  oath  which  he  sware  {horkon  hon  omosen).  Ante- 
cedent attracted  to  case  of  the  relative.  The  oath  appears 
in  Gen.  22:16-18.  The  oppression  of  the  Gentiles  seems  to 
be  in  the  mind  of  Zacharias.  It  is  not  certain  how  clearly 
he  grasped  the  idea  of  the  spiritual  Israel  as  Paul  saw  it  in 
Galatians  and  Romans. 

74.  Delivered  (rhusthentas) .  First  aorist  passive  participle 
of  an  old  verb,  rhuomai.  The  accusative  case  appears,  where 
the  dative  could  have  been  used  to  agree  with  hemin,  be- 
cause of  the  infinitive  latreuein  (verse  74)  to  serve  (from 
latros,  for  hire).  But  Plato  uses  the  word  of  service  for  God 
so  that  the  bad  sense  does  not  always  exist. 

75.  In  holiness  and  righteousness  (en  hosioteti  kai  dikai- 
osunei).  Not  a  usual  combination  (Eph.  4:24;  Tit.  1:8; 
I  Thess.  2:10).  The  Godward  and  the  manward  aspects  of 
conduct  (Bruce).  Hosios,  the  eternal  principles  of  right, 
dikaios,  the  rule  of  conduct  before  men. 

76.  Yea  and  thou  (kai  su  de).  Direct  address  to  the  child 
with  forecast  of  his  life  (cf.  1:13-17).  Prophet  (prophetes). 
The  word  here  directly  applied  to  the  child.  Jesus  will 
later  call  John  a  prophet  and  more  than  a  prophet.  The 
Lord  (Kuriou).    Jehovah  as  in  1:16. 

77.  Knowledge  of  salvation  (gnosin  soterias).  ''This  is 
the  aim  and  end  of  the  work  of  the  Forerunner"  (Plummer). 

78.  Tender  mercy  (splagchna  eleous).  Bowels  of  mercy 
literally  (I  Peter.  3  :8;  James  3  :ii).  Revised  margin  has  it, 
hearts  of  mercy.  The  day  spring  from  on  high  (anatole  ex 
hupsous).    Literally,  rising  from  on  high,  like  the  rising  sun 


20        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

or  stars  (Isa.  60:19).  The  word  is  used  also  of  a  sprouting 
plant  or  branch  (Jer.  23:5;  Zech.  6:12),  but  that  does  not 
suit  here.    Shall  visit  (epeskepsetai),  correct  text,  cf.  1 :68. 

79.  To  shine  upon  {epiphanai) .  First  aorist  active  infini- 
tive of  epiphainb  (liquid  verb).  An  old  verb  to  give  light, 
to  shine  upon,  like  the  sun  or  stars.  See  also  Acts  27:20; 
Tit.  2:11;  3:4.  The  shadow  of  death  (skidi  thanatou).  See 
Psa.  107:10,  where  darkness  and  shadow  of  death  are  com- 
bined as  here.  Cf.  also  Isa.  9:1.  See  on  Matt.  4:16.  To 
guide  (tou  kateuthunai) .  Genitive  of  the  articular  infinitive 
of  purpose.  The  light  will  enable  them  in  the  dark  to  see 
how  to  walk  in  a  straight  path  that  leads  to  "the  way  of 
peace."  We  are  still  on  that  road,  but  so  many  stumble 
for  lack  of  light,  men  and  nations. 

80.  Grew  (euxane).  Imperfect  active,  was  growing. 
Waxed  strong  {ekrataiouto).  Imperfect  again.  The  child 
kept  growing  in  strength  of  body  and  spirit.  His  shewing 
{anadeixeos  autou).  Here  alone  in  the  N.T.  It  occurs  in 
Plutarch  and  Polybius.  The  verb  appears  in  a  sacrificial 
sense.  The  boy,  as  he  grew,  may  have  gone  up  to  the  pass- 
over  and  may  have  seen  the  boy  Jesus  (Luke  2:42-52),  but 
he  would  not  know  that  he  was  to  be  the  Messiah.  So  these 
two  boys  of  destiny  grew  on  with  the  years,  the  one  in  the 
desert  hills  near  Hebron  after  Zacharias  and  Elisabeth  died, 
the  other,  the  young  Carpenter  up  in  Nazareth,  each  wait- 
ing for  "his  shewing  unto  Israel." 


CHAPTER  II 

1.  Decree  from  Caesar  Augustus  {dogma  para  Kaisaros 
Augoustou) .  Old  and  common  word  from  dokeo,  to  think, 
form  an  opinion.  No  such  decree  was  given  by  Greek  or 
Roman  historians  and  it  was  for  long  assumed  by  many 
scholars  that  Luke  was  in  error.  But  papyri  and  inscrip- 
tions have  confirmed  Luke  on  every  point  in  these  crucial 
verses  2:1-7.  See  W.  M.  Ramsay's  books  {Was  Christ  Born 
at  Bethelehem?  Luke  the  Physician.  The  Bearing  of  Recent 
Discovery  on  the  Trustworthiness  of  the  N.T.).  The  World 
{ten  oikoumenen).  Literally,  the  inhabited  {land,  gen).  In- 
habited by  the  Greeks,  then  by  the  Romans,  then  the  whole 
world  (Roman  world,  the  world  ruled  by  Rome).  So  Acts 
11:28;  17:6.  Should  be  enrolled  {apographesthai).  It  was  a 
census,  not  a  taxing,  though  taxing  generally  followed  and 
was  based  on  the  census.  This  word  is  very  old  and  com- 
mon. It  means  to  write  or  copy  off  for  the  public  records, 
to  register. 

2.  The  first  enrolment  {apographs  prbte).  A  definite  allu- 
sion by  Luke  to  a  series  of  censuses  instituted  by  Augustus, 
the  second  of  which  is  mentioned  by  him  in  Acts  5:37.  This 
second  one  is  described  by  Josephus  and  it  was  supposed  by 
some  that  Luke  confused  the  two.  But  Ramsay  has  shown 
that  a  periodical  fourteen-year  census  in  Egypt  is  given  in 
dated  papyri  back  to  a.d.  20.  The  one  in  Acts  5:37  would 
then  be  a.d.  6.  This  is  in  the  time  of  Augustus.  The  first 
would  then  be  B.C.  8  in  Egypt.  If  it  was  delayed  a  couple 
of  years  in  Palestine  by  Herod  the  Great  for  obvious  rea- 
sons, that  would  make  the  birth  of  Christ  about  B.C.  6  which 
agrees  with  the  other  known  data.  When  Quirinius  {Kure- 
niou).     Genitive  absolute.    Here  again  Luke  has  been  at- 

21 


22        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

tacked  on  the  ground  that  Quirinius  was  only  governor  of 
Syria  once  and  that  was  a.d.  6  as  shown  by  Josephus  {Ant. 
XVIII.  I.  i).  But  Ramsay  has  proven  by  inscriptions  that 
Quirinius  was  twice  in  Syria  and  that  Luke  is  correct  here 
also.  See  summary  of  the  facts  in  my  Luke  the  Historian  in 
the  Light  of  Research,  pp.  118-29. 

3.  Each  to  his  own  city  {hekastos  eis  ten  heautou  polin).  A 
number  of  papyri  in  Egypt  have  the  heading  enrolment  by 
household  {apograph?  katy  oikian).  Here  again  Luke  is 
vindicated.  Each  man  went  to  the  town  where  his  family 
register  was  kept. 

5.  To  enrol  himself  with  Mary  {apograpsasthai  sun  Ma- 
riam).  Direct  middle.  "With  Mary"  is  naturally  taken 
with  the  infinitive  as  here.  If  so,  that  means  that  Mary's 
family  register  was  in  Bethlehem  also  and  that  she  also  be- 
longed to  the  house  of  David.  It  is  possible  to  connect 
"with  Mary"  far  back  with  "went  up"  {anebe)  in  verse  4, 
but  it  is  unnatural  to  do  so.  There  is  no  real  reason  for 
doubting  that  Mary  herself  was  a  descendant  of  David  and 
that  is  the  obvious  way  to  understand  Luke's  genealogy  of 
Jesus  in  Luke  3:23-38).  The  Syriac  Sinaitic  expressly  says 
that  both  Joseph  and  Mary  were  of  the  house  and  city  of 
David.  Betrothed  {emnesteumenen).  Same  verb  as  in  1:27, 
but  here  it  really  means  "married"  or  "espoused"  as  Matt. 
1 :24f.  shows.  Otherwise  she  could  not  have  travelled  with 
Joseph.  Great  with  child  {enkubi).  Only  here  in  N.T. 
Common  Greek  word. 

6.  That  she  should  be  delivered  {tou  tekein  auten).  For  the 
bearing  the  child  as  to  her.  A  neat  use  of  the  articular  infini- 
tive, second  aorist  active,  with  the  accusative  of  general 
reference.    From  tikto,  common  verb. 

7.  Her  firstborn  {ton  prbtotokon).  The  expression  natu- 
rally means  that  she  afterwards  had  other  children  and  we 
read  of  brothers  and  sisters  of  Jesus.  There  is  not  a  par- 
ticle of  evidence  for  the  notion  that  Mary  refused  to  bear 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  23 

other  children  because  she  was  the  mother  of  the  Messiah. 
Wrapped  in  swaddling  clothes  {esparganbsen).  From  spar- 
ganon,  a  swathing  band.  Only  here  and  verse  12  in  the  N.T., 
but  in  Euripides,  Aristotle,  Hippocrates,  Plutarch.  Fre- 
quent in  medical  works.  In  a  manger  {en  phatnei).  In  a 
crib  in  a  stall  whether  in  a  cave  (Justin  Martyr)  or  connected 
with  the  inn  we  do  not  know.  The  cattle  may  have  been 
out  on  the  hills  or  the  donkeys  used  in  travelling  may  have 
been  feeding  in  this  stall  or  another  near.  In  the  inn  {en  tbi 
katalumati) .  A  lodging-house  or  khan,  poor  enough  at  best, 
but  there  was  not  even  room  in  this  public  place  because  of 
the  crowds  for  the  census.  See  the  word  also  in  Luke  22:11 
and  Mark  14:14  with  the  sense  of  guest-room  (cf.  I  Kings 
1:13).  It  is  the  Hellenistic  equivalent  for  katagogeion  and  ap- 
pears also  in  one  papyrus.  See  Ex.  4:24.  There  would  some- 
times be  an  inner  court,  a  range  or  arches,  an  open  gallery 
round  the  four  sides.  On  one  side  of  the  square,  outside 
the  wall,  would  be  stables  for  the  asses  and  camels,  buffa- 
loes and  goats.  Each  man  had  to  carry  his  own  food  and 
bedding. 

8.  Abiding  in  the  field  {agraulountes).  From  agros,  field 
and  aule,  court.  The  shepherds  were  making  the  field  their 
court.  Plutarch  and  Strabo  use  the  word.  Keeping  watch 
{phulassontes  phulakas).  Cognate  accusative.  They  were 
bivouacking  by  night  and  it  was  plainly  mild  weather.  In 
these  very  pastures  David  had  fought  the  lion  and  the  bear 
to  protect  the  sheep  (I  Sam.  17:341.).  The  plural  here 
probably  means  that  they  watched  by  turns.  The  flock 
may  have  been  meant  for  the  temple  sacrifices.  There  is 
no  way  to  tell. 

9.  Stood  by  them  {epeste  autois).  Ingressive  aorist  active 
indicative.  Stepped  by  their  side.  The  same  word  in 
Acts  12:7  of  the  angel  there.  Paul  uses  it  in  the  sense  of 
standing  by  in  Acts  22:20.  It  is  a  common  old  Greek  word, 
ephisiemi.     Were  sore  afraid  {ephobethesan  phobon  megan). 


24        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

First  aorist  passive  indicative  with  cognate  accusative  (the 
passive  sense  gone),  they  feared  a  great  fear. 

10.  /  bring  you  good  tidings  of  great  joy  (euaggelizomai 
humin  char  an  megalen).  Wy  cliff,  "I  evangelize  to  you  a 
great  joy."  The  active  verb  euaggelizo  occurs  only  in  late 
Greek  writers,  LXX,  a  few  papyri  examples,  and  the  N.T. 
The  middle  (deponent)  appears  from  Aristophanes  on. 
Luke  and  Paul  employ  both  substantive  euaggelion  and  verb 
euaggelizo  very  frequently.  It  is  to  Paul's  influence  that  we 
owe  their  frequency  and  popularity  in  the  language  of 
Christendom  (George  Milligan,  The  Epistles  to  the  Thes- 
salonians,  p.  143).  The  other  Gospels  do  not  have  the  verb 
save  Matt.  11:5  and  that  in  a  quotation  (Isa.  61:1). 

11.  Is  born  (etechthe).  First  aorist  passive  indicative  from 
tikto.  Was  born.  Saviour  (sbter).  This  great  word  is  com- 
mon in  Luke  and  Paul  and  seldom  elsewhere  in  the  N.T. 
(Bruce).  The  people  under  Rome's  rule  came  to  call  the  em- 
peror "Saviour"  and  Christians  took  the  word  and  used  it 
of  Christ.  See  inscriptions  (Deissmann,  Light  from  the  An- 
cient East,  p.  344).  Christ  the  Lord  (Christos  Kurios).  This 
combination  occurs  nowhere  else  in  the  N.T.  and  it  is  not 
clear  what  it  really  means.  Luke  is  very  fond  of  Kurios 
(Lord)  where  the  other  Gospels  have  Jesus.  It  may  mean 
" Christ  the  Lord,"  "Anointed  Lord,"  "Messiah,  Lord," 
"The  Messiah,  the  Lord,"  "An  Anointed  One,  a  Lord,"  or 
"Lord  Messiah."  It  occurs  once  in  the  LXX  (Lam.  4:20) 
and  is  in  Ps.  of  Sol.  17:36.  Ragg  suggests  that  our  phrase 
"the  Lord  Jesus  Christ"  is  really  involved  in  "A  Saviour 
(Jesus)  which  is  Christ  the  Lord."  See  on  Matt.  1:1  for 
Christ  and  Matt.  21:3  for  Lord. 

13.  Host  (stratias).  A  military  term  for  a  band  of  soldiers 
common  in  the  ancient  Greek.  Bengel  says :  "  Here  the  army 
announces  peace."  Praising  (ainountbn).  Construction  ac- 
cording to  sense  (plural,  though  stratias  is  singular). 

14.  Among  men  in  whom  he  is  well  ^ eased  (en  anthropois 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  25 

eudokias).  The  Textus  Receptus  (Authorized  Version  also 
has  eudokia,  but  the  genitive  eudokias  is  undoubtedly  cor- 
rect, supported  by  the  oldest  and  best  uncials.  (Aleph,  A 
B  D  W).  C  has  a  lacuna  here.  Plummer  justly  notes  how 
in  this  angelic  hymn  Glory  and  Peace  correspond,  in  the 
highest  and  on  earth,  to  God  and  among  men  of  goodwill. 
It  would  be  possible  to  connect  "on  earth"  with  "the  high- 
est" and  also  to  have  a  triple  division.  There  has  been  much 
objection  raised  to  the  genitive  eudokias,  the  correct  text. 
But  it  makes  perfectly  good  sense  and  better  sense.  As  a 
matter  of  fact  real  peace  on  earth  exists  only  among  those 
who  are  the  subjects  of  God's  goodwill,  who  are  character- 
ized by  goodwill  toward  God  and  man.  This  word  eudokia 
we  have  already  had  in  Matt.  1 1 126.  It  does  not  occur  in  the 
ancient  Greek.  The  word  is  confined  to  Jewish  and  Chris- 
tian writings,  though  the  papyri  furnish  instances  of  eudoke- 
sis.    Wycliff  has  it  "to  men  of  goodwill." 

15.  Said  to  one  another  (elaloun  pros  allelous).  Imperfect 
tense,  inchoative,  "began  to  speak,"  each  to  the  other.  It 
suggests  also  repetition,  they  kept  saying,  Now  (de).  A 
particle  of  urgency.  This  thing  (to  rhema  touto).  A  Hebrais- 
tic and  vernacular  use  of  rhema  (something  said)  as  some- 
thing done.  See  on  Luke  1:65.  The  ancient  Greek  used 
logos  in  this  same  way. 

16.  With  haste  (speusantes).  Aorist  active  participle  of 
simultaneous  action.  Found  (aneuran).  Second  aorist  ac- 
tive indicative  of  a  common  Greek  verb  aneurisko,  but  only 
in  Luke  in  the  N.T.  The  compound  ana  suggests  a  search 
before  finding. 

17.  Made  known  (egnorisan).  Toothers  (verse  18)  besides 
Joseph  and  Mary.  The  verb  is  common  from  Aeschylus  on, 
from  the  root  of  ginosko  (to  know).  It  is  both  transitive  and 
intransitive  in  the  N.T. 

19.  Kept  (suneterei).  Imperfect  active.  She  kept  on  keep- 
ing together  (sun-)  all  these  things.    They  were  meat  and 


26        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

drink  to  her.  She  was  not  astonished,  but  rilled  with  holy- 
awe.  The  verb  occurs  from  Aristotle  on.  She  could  not 
forget.  But  did  not  Mary  keep  also  a  Baby  Book?  And  may 
not  Luke  have  seen  it?  Pondering  (sunballousa).  An  old 
Greek  word.  Placing  together  for  comparison.  Mary  would 
go  over  each  detail  in  the  words  of  Gabriel  and  of  the  shep- 
herds and  compare  the  sayings  with  the  facts  so  far  developed 
and  brood  over  it  all  with  a  mother's  high  hopes  and  joy. 

21.  His  name  was  called  Jesus  (kai  eklethe  to  onoma  autou 
Iesous).  The  kai  is  left  untranslated  or  has  the  sense  of 
"then"  in  the  apodosis.  The  naming  was  a  part  of  the  cere- 
mony of  circumcision  as  is  shown  also  in  the  case  of  John  the 
Baptist  (Luke  1:59-66). 

22.  The  days  of  their  purification  (hai  hemerai  tou  katharis- 
mou  autbn).  The  old  manuscripts  have  "their"  {autbn)  in- 
stead of  "her"  (autes)  of  the  later  documents.  But  it  is  not 
clear  whether  "their"  refers  to  Mary  and  Joseph  as  is  true 
of  "they  brought"  or  to  Mary  and  the  child.  The  mother 
was  Levitically  unclean  for  forty  days  after  the  birth  of  a  son 
(Lev.  12:1-8).  To  present  him  to  the  Lord  (parastesai  tbi 
Kuribi).  Every  first-born  son  was  thus  redeemed  by  the 
sacrifice  (Ex.  13:2-12)  as  a  memorial  of  the  sparing  of  the 
Israelitish  families  (Num.  18:1 5f.).  The  cost  was  about  two 
dollars  and  a  half  in  our  money. 

23.  In  the  law  of  the  Lord  {en  nombi  Kuriou).  No  articles, 
but  definite  by  preposition  and  genitive.  Vincent  notes  that 
"law"  occurs  in  this  chapter  five  times.  Paul  (Gal.  4:4)  will 
urge  that  Jesus  "was  made  under  the  law"  as  Luke  here  ex- 
plains. The  law  did  not  require  that  the  child  be  brought  to 
Jerusalem.  The  purification  concerned  the  mother,  the 
presentation  the  son. 

24.  A  pair  of  turtledoves,  or  two  young  pigeons  {Zeugos 
trugonbn  e  duo  nossous  peristerbn).  The  offspring  of  the  poor, 
costing  about  sixteen  cents,  while  a  lamb  would  cost  nearly 
two  dollars.    The  "young  of  pigeons"  is  the  literal  meaning. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  27 

25.  Devout  (eulabes).  Used  only  by  Luke  (Acts  2:5;  8:2; 
22:12)  in  the  N.T.  Common  in  ancient  Greek  from  Plato  on. 
It  means  taking  hold  well  or  carefully  (eu  and  labein)  and  so 
reverently,  circumspectly.  Looking  for  the  consolation  of 
Israel  (prosdechomenos  paraklesin  tou  Israel).  Old  Greek  verb 
to  admit  to  one's  presence  (Luke  15:2)  and  then  to  expect 
as  here  and  of  Anna  in  verse  38.  Paraklesin  here  means  the 
Messianic  hope  (Isa.  11:10;  40:1),  calling  to  one's  side  for 
cheer.  Upon  him  (<?/>'  auton).  This  is  the  explanation  of  his 
lively  Messianic  hope.  It  was  due  to  the  Holy  Spirit.  Sim- 
eon and  Anna  are  representatives  of  real  piety  in  this  time 
of  spiritual  dearth  and  deadness. 

26.  It  had  been  revealed  unto  him  {en  autbi  kechrematisme- 
non).  Periphrastic  past  perfect  passive  indicative.  Com- 
mon Greek  verb.  First  to  transact  business  from  chrema 
and  that  from  chraomai,  to  use,  make  use  of;  then  to  do  busi- 
ness with  public  officials,  to  give  advice  (judges,  rulers, 
kings),  then  to  get  the  advice  of  the  Delphic  and  other  or- 
acles (Diodorus,  Plutarch).  The  LXX  and  Josephus  use  it 
of  God's  commands.  A  Fayum  papyrus  of  257  B.C.  has  the 
substantive  chremastismos  for  a  divine  response  (cf.  Rom. 
11:4).  See  Deissmann,  Light  From  the  Ancient  East,  p.  153. 
Before  (prin  e).  Classic  Greek  idiom  after  a  negative  to  have 
subjunctive  as  here  (only  example  in  the  N.T.)  or  the  opta- 
tive after  past  tense  as  in  Acts  25:16  (subjunctive  changed 
to  optative  in  indirect  discourse).  Elsewhere  in  the  N.T. 
the  infinitive  follows  prin  as  in  Matt.  1:18. 

27.  When  the  parents  brought  in  the  child  Jesus  (en  toi 
eisagagein  tous  goneis  to  paidion  lesoun).  A  neat  Greek  and 
Hebrew  idiom  difficult  to  render  into  English,  very  common 
in  the  LXX;  In  the  bringing  the  Child  Jesus  as  to  the  parents. 
The  articular  infinitive  and  two  accusatives  (one  the  object, 
the  other  accusative  of  general  reference).  After  the  custom 
of  the  law  (kata  to  eithismenon  tou  nomou).  Here  the  perfect 
passive  participle  eithismenon,  neuter  singular  from  ethizo 


28        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

(common  Greek  verb,  to  accustom)  is  used  as  a  virtual  sub- 
stantive like  to  ethos  in  1 :8.  Luke  alone  in  the  N.T.  uses 
either  word  save  ethos  in  John  19:40,  though  eidtha  from  etho, 
occurs  also  in  Matt.  27:15;  Mark  10:1. 

28.  Then  he  {kai  autos).  Kai  as  in  2:21.  Autos,  emphatic 
subject,  he  after  the  parents.  Arms  {agkalas).  Old  Greek 
word,  here  only  in  the  N.T.  It  means  the  curve  or  inner 
angle  of  the  arm. 

29.  Now  lettest  thou  {nun  apolueis).  Present  active  indic- 
ative, Thou  art  letting.  The  Nunc  Dimittis,  adoration  and 
praise.  It  is  full  of  rapture  and  vivid  intensity  (Plummer) 
like  the  best  of  the  Psalms.  The  verb  apoluo  was  common 
for  the  manumission  of  slaves  and  Simeon  here  calls  himself 
"thy  slave  {doulon  sou),  Lord  {Despota,  our  despot)."  See 
II  Pet.  2:1. 

31.  Of  all  the  peoples  {panton  ton  laon).  Not  merely  Jews. 
Another  illustration  of  the  universality  of  Luke's  Gospel  seen 
already  in  1  :jo  in  the  hymn  of  Zacharias.  The  second 
strophe  of  the  song  according  to  Plummer  showing  what  the 
Messiah  will  be  to  the  world  after  having  shown  what  the 
Messiah  is  to  Simeon. 

32.  Revelation  to  the  Gentiles  (apokalupsin  ethnon).  Ob- 
jective genitive.  The  Messiah  is  to  be  light  {phos)  for  the 
Gentiles  in  darkness  (1:70)  and  glory  {doxa)  for  Israel  (cf. 
Rom.  9:1-5;  Isa.  49:6).  The  word  ethnos  originally  meant 
just  a  crowd  or  company,  then  a  race  or  nation,  then  the  na- 
tions other  than  Israel  (the  people,  ho  laos)  or  the  people  of 
God.  The  word  Gentile  is  Latin  from  gens,  a  tribe  or  nation. 
But  the  world-wide  mission  of  the  Messiah  comes  out  clearly 
in  these  early  chapters  in  Luke. 

33.  His  father  and  his  mother  {ho  pater  autou  kai  he  meter). 
Luke  had  already  used  "parents"  in  2:27.  He  by  no  means 
intends  to  deny  the  Virgin  Birth  of  Jesus  so  plainly  stated  in 
1 :34~ 38.  He  merely  employs  here  the  language  of  ordinary 
custom.    The  late  MSS.  wrongly  read  "and  Joseph"  instead 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  29 

of  "his  father."  Were  marvelling  (en  thaumazontes).  The 
masculine  gender  includes  the  feminine  when  both  are  re- 
ferred to.  But  en  is  singular,  not  esan,  the  normal  imperfect 
plural  in  this  periphrastic  imperfect.  This  is  due  to  the  wide 
space  between  copula  and  participle.  The  copula  en  agrees 
in  number  with  ho  pater  while  the  participle  coming  last 
agrees  with  both  ho  pater  kai  he  meter  (cf.  Matt.  17:3 ;  22:40). 
If  one  wonders  why  they  marvelled  at  Simeon's  words  after 
what  they  had  heard  from  Gabriel,  Elisabeth,  and  the  Shep- 
herds, he  should  bear  in  mind  that  every  parent  is  astonished 
and  pleased  at  the  fine  things  others  see  in  the  child.  It  is  a 
mark  of  unusual  insight  for  others  to  see  so  much  that  is 
obvious  to  the  parent.  Simeon's  prophecy  had  gone  beyond 
the  angel's  outline  and  it  was  surprising  that  he  should  know 
anything  about  the  child's  destiny. 

34.  Is  set  for  the  falling  and  the  rising  up  of  many  in  Israel 
(Keitai  eis  pibsin  kai  anastasin  pollon  en  tbi  Israel) .  Present 
indicative  of  the  old  defective  verb  appearing  only  in  present 
and  imperfect  in  the  N.T.  Sometimes  it  is  used  as  the  passive 
of  tithemi  as  here.  The  falling  of  some  and  the  rising  up  of 
others  is  what  is  meant.  He  will  be  a  stumbling-block  to  some 
(Isa.  8:14;  Matt.  21:42,  44;  Rom.  9:33;  I  Pet.  2:i6f.)  who  love 
darkness  rather  than  light  (John  3  :i9),  he  will  be  the  cause  of 
rising  for  others  (Rom.  6:4,  9;  Eph.  2:6).  "Judas  despairs, 
Peter  repents:  one  robber  blasphemes,  the  other  confesses" 
(Plummer).  Jesus  is  the  magnet  of  the  ages.  He  draws 
some,  he  repels  others.  This  is  true  of  all  epoch-making  men 
to  some  extent.  Spoken  against  (antilegomenon) .  Present 
passive  participle,  continuous  action.  It  is  going  on  today. 
Nietzsche  regarded  Jesus  Christ  as  the  curse  of  the  race  be- 
cause he  spared  the  weak. 

35.  A  sword  (rhomphaia).  A  large  sword,  properly  a  long 
Thracian  javelin.  It  occurs  in  the  LXX  of  Goliath's  sword 
(I  Sam.  17:51).  How  little  Mary  understood  the  meaning 
of  Simeon's  words  that  seemed  so  out  of  place  in  the  midst 


30        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

of  the  glorious  things  already  spoken,  a  sharp  thorn  in  their 
roses,  a  veritable  bitter-sweet.  But  one  day  Mary  will  stand 
by  the  Cross  of  Christ  with  this  Thracian  javelin  clean 
through  her  soul,  stabat  Mater  Dolorosa  (John  19:25).  It  is 
only  a  parenthesis  here,  and  a  passing  cloud  perhaps  passed 
over  Mary's  heart  already  puzzled  with  rapture  and  ecstasy. 
May  be  revealed  (apokaluphthosin) .  Unveiled.  First  aorist 
passive  subjunctive  after  hopos  an  and  expresses  God's  pur- 
pose in  the  mission  of  the  Messiah.  He  is  to  test  men's 
thoughts  (dialogismoi)  and  purposes.  They  will  be  com- 
pelled to  take  a  stand  for  Christ  or  against  him.  That  is  true 
today. 

36.  One  Anna  a  prophetess  (Hanna  prophetis).  The  word 
prophetis  occurs  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Rev.  2:20.  In 
old  Greek  writers  it  means  a  woman  who  interprets  oracles. 
The  long  parenthesis  into  verse  37  tells  of  her  great  age. 
Montefiore  makes  it  106  as  she  was  15  when  married,  mar- 
ried 7  years,  a  widow  84. 

37.  Which  departed  not  (he  ouk  aphistato).  Imperfect  in- 
dicative middle.  She  kept  on  not  leaving.  The  Spirit  kept 
her  in  the  temple  as  he  led  Simon  to  the  temple  (Plummer). 
The  case  of  "the  temple"  (tou  hierou)  is  ablative.  Night 
and  day  (nukta  kai  hemeran).  Accusative  of  duration  of 
time,  all  night  and  all  day.  She  never  missed  a  service  in 
the  temple. 

38.  Coming  up  (epistasa).  Second  aorist  active  participle. 
The  word  often  has  the  notion  of  coming  suddenly  or  bursting 
in  as  of  Martha  in  Luke  10:40.  But  here  it  probably  means 
coming  up  and  standing  by  and  so  hearing  Simeon's  wonder- 
ful words  so  that  her  words  form  a  kind  of  footnote  to  his. 
Gave  thanks  (anthomologeito).  Imperfect  middle  of  a  verb 
(anthomologeo)  in  common  use  in  Greek  writers  and  in  the 
LXX  though  here  alone  in  the  N.T.  It  had  the  idea  of  a 
mutual  agreement  or  of  saying  something  before  one  (anti). 
Anna  was  evidently  deeply  moved  and  repeated  her  thanks- 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  31 

giving  and  kept  speaking  (elalei,  imperfect  again)  "to  all 
them  that  were  looking  for  (prosdechomenois,  as  in  1:35  of 
Simeon)  the  redemption  of  Jerusalem  (lutrdsin  Ierousalem)." 
There  was  evidently  a  group  of  such  spirits  that  gathered 
in  the  temple  either  men  around  her  and  Simeon  or  whom 
she  met  from  time  to  time.  There  was  thus  a  nucleus  of  old 
saints  in  Jerusalem  prepared  for  the  coming  of  the  Messiah 
when  he  at  last  appears  as  the  Messiah  in  Jerusalem  (John 
2  and  3).  These  probably  all  passed  away.  But  they  had  a 
happy  hour  of  hope  and  joy.  The  late  MSS.  have  "in  Jeru- 
salem" but  "of  Jerusalem"  is  correct.  What  they  meant  by 
the  "redemption  of  Jerusalem"  is  not  clear,  whether  political 
or  spiritual  or  both.  Simeon  was  looking  for  the  consolation 
of  Israel  (2:25)  and  Zacharias  (1:68)  sang  of  redemption  for 
Israel  (Isa.  40:2). 

39.  To  their  own  city  Nazareth  (eis  polin  heautbn  Nazaret). 
See  on  Matt.  2 123  about  Nazareth.  Luke  tells  nothing  of  the 
flight  to  Egypt  and  the  reason  for  the  return  to  Nazareth 
instead  of  Bethlehem,  the  place  of  the  birth  of  Jesus  as  told 
in  Matt.  2:13-23.  But  then  neither  Gospel  gives  all  the  de- 
tails of  this  period.  Luke  has  also  nothing  about  the  visit 
of  the  wise  men  (Matt.  2:1-12)  as  Matthew  tells  nothing  of 
the  shepherds  and  of  Simeon  and  Anna  (Luke  2 :8-28) .  The 
two  Gospels  supplement  each  other. 

40.  The  child  grew  (euxane).  Imperfect  indicative  of  a 
very  ancient  verb  (auxano).  This  child  grew  and  waxed 
strong  (ekrataiouto,  imperfect  middle),  a  hearty  vigorous  little 
boy  (paidion).  Both  verbs  Luke  used  in  1 :8o  of  the  growth 
of  John  the  Baptist  as  a  child.  Then  he  used  also  pneumati, 
in  spirit.  Here  in  addition  to  the  bodily  development  Luke 
has  "filled  with  wisdom"  {pleroumenon  sophidi).  Present 
passive  participle,  showing  that  the  process  of  filling  with 
wisdom  kept  pace  with  the  bodily  growth.  If  it  were  only 
always  true  with  others !  We  need  not  be  troubled  over  this 
growth  in  wisdom  on  the  part  of  Jesus  any  more  than  over 


32        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

his  bodily  growth.  "The  intellectual,  moral,  and  spiritual 
growth  of  the  Child,  like  the  physical,  was  real.  His  was  a 
perfect  humanity  developing  perfectly,  unimpeded  by  hered- 
itary or  acquired  defects.  It  was  the  first  instance  of  such  a 
growth  in  history.  For  the  first  time  a  human  infant  was 
realizing  the  ideal  of  humanity"  (Plummer).  The  grace  of 
God  {charts  theou).     In  full  measure. 

41.  Every  year  (kat1  etos).  This  idiom  only  here  in  the 
N.T.,  a  common  Greek  construction.  Every  male  was  orig- 
inally expected  to  appear  at  the  passover,  pentecost,  and 
tabernacles  (Ex.  23:14-17;  34:23;  Deut.  16:16).  But  the 
Dispersion  rendered  that  impossible.  But  pious  Palestinian 
Jews  made  a  point  of  going  at  least  to  the  passover.  Mary 
went  with  Joseph  as  a  pious  habit,  though  not  required  by 
law  to  go. 

42.  Twelve  years  old  (etbn  dbdeka).  Predicate  genitive. 
Luke  does  not  say  that  Jesus  had  not  been  to  Jerusalem  be- 
fore, but  at  twelve  a  Jewish  boy  became  a  "son  of  the  law" 
and  began  to  observe  the  ordinances,  putting  on  the  phy- 
lacteries as  a  reminder.  They  went  up  {anabainontbn  autbn). 
Genitive  absolute  with  present  active  participle,  a  loose  con- 
struction here,  for  the  incident  narrated  took  place  after  they 
had  gone  up,  not  while  they  were  gong  up.  "On  their  usual 
going  up"  (Plummer). 

43.  When  they  had  fulfilled  the  days  (teleibsantbn  tas  he- 
meras).  Genitive  absolute  again,  but  aorist  participle  (effec- 
tive aorist).  "The  days "  may  mean  the  full  seven  days  (Ex. 
I2:i5f.;  Lev.  23:6-8;  Deut.  16:3),  or  the  two  chief  days  after 
which  many  pilgrims  left  for  home.  As  they  were  returning  (en 
tbi  hupostrephein  antous).  The  articular  infinitive  with  en, 
a  construction  that  Luke  often  uses  (1:21;  2:27).  The  boy, 
Jesus  (Iesous  ho  pais).  More  exactly,  "Jesus  the  boy."  In 
verse  40  it  was  "the  child  "  (to  paidion),  here  it  is  "the  boy" 
(ho  pais,  no  longer  the  diminutive  form).  It  was  not  dis- 
obedience on  the  part  of  "the  boy"  that  made  him  remain 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  33 

behind,  but  intense  interest  in  the  services  of  the  temple; 
"involuntary  preoccupation"  (Bruce)  held  him  fast. 

44.  In  the  company  {en  tei  sunodiai).  The  caravan  going 
together  on  the  road  or  way  {sun,  hodos),  a  journey  in  com- 
pany, then  by  metonymy  the  company  itself.  A  common 
Greek  word  (Plutarch,  Strabo,  etc.).  The  women  usually 
went  ahead  and  the  men  followed.  Joseph  may  have  thought 
Jesus  was  with  Mary  and  Mary  that  he  was  with  Joseph. 
"The  Nazareth  caravan  was  so  long  that  it  took  a  whole  day 
to  look  through  it"  (Plummer).  They  sought  for  him  {aneze- 
toun  auton).  Imperfect  active.  Common  Greek  verb.  Note 
force  of  ana.  They  searched  up  and  down,  back  and  forth,  a 
thorough  search  and  prolonged,  but  in  vain. 

45.  Seeking  for  him  {anazetountes  auton).  Present  par- 
ticiple of  the  same  verb.  This  was  all  that  was  worth  while 
now,  finding  the  lost  boy. 

46.  After  three  days  {meta  hemeras  treis).  One  day  out, 
one  day  back,  and  on  the  third  day  finding  him.  In  the 
temple  {en  toi  hieroi).  Probably  on  the  terrace  where  mem- 
bers of  the  Sanhedrin  gave  public  instruction  on  sabbaths 
and  feast-days,  so  probably  while  the  feast  was  still  going  on. 
The  rabbis  probably  sat  on  benches  in  a  circle.  The  listen- 
ers on  the  ground,  among  whom  was  Jesus  the  boy  in  a  rap- 
ture of  interest.  Both  hearing  them  and  asking  them  questions 
{kai  akouonta  auton  kai  eperotonta  autous).  Paul  sat  at  the 
feet  of  Gamaliel  (Acts  22:3).  Picture  this  eager  boy  alive 
with  interest.  It  was  his  one  opportunity  in  a  theological 
school  outside  of  the  synagogue  to  hear  the  great  rabbis  ex- 
pound the  problems  of  life.  This  was  the  most  unusual  of 
all  children,  to  be  sure,  in  intellectual  grasp  and  power. 
But  it  is  a  mistake  to  think  that  children  of  twelve  do  not 
think  profoundly  concerning  the  issues  of  life.  What  father 
or  mother  has  ever  been  able  to  answer  a  child's  questions? 

47.  Were  amazed  {existanto).  Imperfect  indicative  middle, 
descrirjtive  of  their  continued  and  repeated  astonishment. 


34        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Common  verb  existemi  meaning  that  they  stood  out  of 
themselves  as  if  their  eyes  were  bulging  out.  The  boy  had 
a  holy  thirst  for  knowledge  (Plummer),  and  he  used  a  boy's 
way  of  learning.  At  his  understanding  (epi  tei  sunesei). 
Based  on  (epi),  the  grasp  and  comprehension  from  suniemi, 
comparing  and  combining  things.  Cf.  Mark.  12:33.  His 
answers  (tais  apokrisesin  autou).  It  is  not  difficult  to  ask 
hard  questions,  but  this  boy  had  astounding  answers  to 
their  questions,  revealing  his  amazing  intellectual  and 
spiritual  growth. 

48.  They  were  astonished  (exeplagesan).  Second  aorist 
passive  indicative  of  an  old  Greek  word  (ekplesso),  to  strike 
out,  drive  out  by  a  blow.  Joseph  and  Mary  "were  struck 
out"  by  what  they  saw  and  heard.  Even  they  had  not 
fully  realized  the  power  in  this  wonderful  boy.  Parents 
often  fail  to  perceive  the  wealth  of  nature  in  their  children. 

49.  Son  (teknon).  Child,  literally.  It  was  natural  for 
Mary  to  be  the  first  to  speak.  Why  (Ti).  The  mother's 
reproach  of  the  boy  is  followed  by  a  confession  of  negligence 
on  her  part  and  of  Joseph  (sorrowing,  odunomenoi).  Thy 
father  (ho  pater  sou).  No  contradiction  in  this.  Alford  says: 
"Up  to  this  time  Joseph  had  been  so  called  by  the  holy 
child  himself,  but  from  this  time  never."  Sought  (ezetoumen) . 
Imperfect  tense  describing  the  long  drawn  out  search  for 
three  days.  How  is  it  that  (Ti  hoti).  The  first  words  of 
Jesus  preserved  to  us.  This  crisp  Greek  idiom  without 
copula  expresses  the  boy's  amazement  that  his  parents 
should  not  know  that  there  was  only  one  possible  place  in 
Jerusalem  for  him.  /  must  be  (dei  einai  me).  Messianic 
consciousness  of  the  necessity  laid  on  him.  Jesus  often  uses 
dei  (must)  about  his  work.  Of  all  the  golden  dreams  of  any 
boy  of  twelve  here  is  the  greatest.  In  my  Father's  house 
(en  tois  ton  patros  mou).  Not  "about  my  Father's  business," 
but  "in  my  Father's  house"  (cf.  Gen.  41:51).  Common 
Greek  idiom.    And  note  "my,"  not  "our."    When  the  boy 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  35 

first  became  conscious  of  his  peculiar  relation  to  the  Father 
in  heaven  we  do  not  know.  But  he  has  it  now  at  twelve 
and  it  will  grow  within  him  through  the  years  ahead  in 
Nazareth. 

50.  They  understood  not  (ou  sunekan).  First  aorist  active 
indicative  (one  of  the  k  aorists).  Even  Mary  with  all  her 
previous  preparation  and  brooding  was  not  equal  to  the 
dawning  of  the  Messianic  consciousness  in  her  boy.  "My 
Father  is  God,"  Jesus  had  virtually  said,  "and  I  must 
be  in  His  house."  Bruce  observes  that  a  new  era  has  come 
when  Jesus  calls  God  "Father,"  not  Despotes.  "Even 
we  do  not  yet  fully  understand"  (Bruce)  what  Jesus  the 
boy  here  said. 

51.  He  was  subject  unto  them  {en  hupotassomenos  autois). 
Periphrastic  imperfect  passive.  He  continued  subject  unto 
them,  this  wondrous  boy  who  really  knew  more  than  parents 
and  rabbis,  this  gentle,  obedient,  affectionate  boy.  The 
next  eighteen  years  at  Nazareth  (Luke  3  :23)  he  remained 
growing  into  manhood  and  becoming  the  carpenter  of 
Nazareth  (Mark  6:3)  in  succession  to  Joseph  (Matt.  13:55) 
who  is  mentioned  here  for  the  last  time.  Who  can  tell  the 
wistful  days  when  Jesus  waited  at  Nazareth  for  the  Father 
to  call  him  to  his  Messianic  task?  Kept  {dieter  ei).  Imperfect 
active.  Ancient  Greek  word  {diatereo),  but  only  here  and 
Acts  15:29  in  the  N.T.  though  in  Gen.  37:11.  She  kept 
thoroughly  {did)  all  these  recent  sayings  (or  things,  rhemata). 
In  2:19  suneterei  is  the  word  used  of  Mary  after  the  shepherds 
left.  These  she  kept  pondering  and  comparing  all  the 
things.  Surely  she  has  a  full  heart  now.  Could  she  foresee 
how  destiny  would  take  Jesus  out  beyond  her  mother's 
reach  ? 

52.  Advanced  in  wisdom  and  stature  {proekopten  tei  sophidi 
kai  helikiai).  Imperfect  active,  he  kept  cutting  his  way 
forward  as  through  a  forest  or  jungle  as  pioneers  did.  He 
kept  growing  in  stature  {helikia  may  mean  age,  as  in  12:25, 


36        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

but  stature  here)  and  in  wisdom  (more  than  mere  knowl- 
edge). His  physical,  intellectual,  moral,  spiritual  develop- 
ment was  perfect.  "At  each  stage  he  was  perfect  for  that 
stage"  (Plummer).  In  favour  (chariti).  Or  grace.  This  is 
ideal  manhood  to  have  the  favour  of  God  and  men. 


CHAPTER  III 

1.  Now  in  the  fifteenth  year  {en  etei  de  pentekaidekatbi). 
Tiberius  Caesar  was  ruler  in  the  provinces  two  years  before 
Augustus  Caesar  died.  Luke  makes  a  six-fold  attempt  here 
to  indicate  the  time  when  John  the  Baptist  began  his  minis- 
try. John  revived  the  function  of  the  prophet  (Ecce  Homo, 
p.  2)  and  it  was  a  momentous  event  after  centuries  of  pro- 
phetic silence.  Luke  begins  with  the  Roman  Emperor,  then 
mentions  Pontius  Pilate  Procurator  of  Judea,  Herod  Antipas, 
Tetrarch  of  Galilee  (and  Perea),  Philip,  Tetrarch  of  Iturea 
and  Trachonitis,  Lysanias,  Tetrarch  of  Abilene  (all  with  the 
genitive  absolute  construction)  and  concludes  with  the 
high-priesthood  of  Annas  and  Caiaphas  (son-in-law  and  suc- 
cessor of  Annas).  The  ancients  did  not  have  our  modern 
system  of  chronology,  the  names  of  rulers  as  here  being  the 
common  way.  Objection  has  been  made  to  the  mention  of 
Lysanias  here  because  Josephus  (Ant.  XXVII.  1)  tells 
of  a  Lysanias  who  was  King  of  Abila  up  to  b.c.  36  as  the  one 
referred  to  by  Luke  with  the  wrong  date.  But  an  inscription 
has  been  found  on  the  site  of  Abilene  with  mention  of 
"Lysanias  the  tetrarch"  and  at  the  time  to  which  Luke 
refers  (see  my  Luke  the  Historian  in  the  Light  of  Research, 
pp.  1671.).    So  Luke  is  vindicated  again  by  the  rocks. 

2.  The  Word  of  God  came  unto  John  (egeneto  rhema  theou 
epi  Ioanen).  The  great  epoch  marked  by  egeneto  rather 
than  en.  Rhema  theou  is  some  particular  utterance  of  God 
(Plummer),  common  in  LXX,  here  alone  in  the  N.T.  Then 
John  is  introduced  as  the  son  of  Zacharias  according  to 
Chapter  I.  Matthew  describes  him  as  the  Baptist,  Mark 
as  the  Baptizer.  No  other  Gospel  mentions  Zacharias. 
Mark  begins  his  Gospel  here,  but  Matthew  and  Luke  have 

37 


38        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

two  Infancy  Chapters  before.  Luke  alone  tells  of  the 
coming  of  the  word  to  John.  All  three  Synoptics  locate 
him  "in  the  wilderness"  (en  tei  eremoi)  as  here,  Mark  1:4; 
Matt.  3:1  (adding  "of  Judea"). 

3.  All  the  region  round  about  Jordan  (pas an  perichoron 
tou  Iordanou).  The  wilderness  was  John's  abode  (1:80)  so 
that  he  began  preaching  where  he  was.  It  was  the  plain 
(Gen.  13  :iof.)  or  valley  of  the  Jordan,  El  Ghor,  as  far  north 
as  Succoth  (II  Chron.  4:17).  Sometimes  he  was  on  the 
eastern  bank  of  the  Jordan  (John  10:40),  though  usually 
on  the  west  side.  His  baptizing  kept  him  near  the  river. 
The  baptism  of  repentance  unto  remission  of  sins  (baptisma 
metanoias  eis  aphesin  hamartion).  The  same  phrase  as  in 
Mark  1 14,  which  see  for  discussion  of  these  important  words. 
The  word  remission  (aphesis)  "occurs  in  Luke  more  fre- 
quently than  in  all  the  other  New  Testament  writers  com- 
bined" (Vincent).  In  medical  writers  it  is  used  for  the  re- 
laxing of  disease. 

4.  As  it  is  written  (hos  gegraptai).  The  regular  formula  for 
quotation,  perfect  passive  indicative  of  grapho.  Isaiah  the 
prophet  (Esaiou  tou  prophetou).  The  same  phrase  in  Mark 
1:2  (correct  text)  and  Matt.  3:3.  Mark,  as  we  have  seen, 
adds  a  quotation  from  Mai.  3:1  and  Luke  gives  verses  4 
and  5  of  Isa.  40  not  in  Matthew  or  Mark  (Luke  3:5  and 
6).    See  Matt.  3:3  and  Mark  1:3  for  discussion  of  Luke  4:4. 

5.  Valley  (pharagx).  Here  only  in  the  N.T.,  though  in  the 
LXX  and  ancient  Greek.  It  is  a  ravine  or  valley  hedged  in 
by  precipices.  Shall  be  filled  (plerothesetai).  Future  passive 
indicative  of  pleroo.  In  1845  when  the  Sultan  visited  Brusa 
the  inhabitants  were  called  out  to  clear  the  roads  of  rocks 
and  to  fill  up  the  hollows.  Oriental  monarchs  often  did  this 
very  thing.  A  royal  courier  would  go  ahead  to  issue  the 
call.  So  the  Messiah  sends  his  herald  (John)  before  him  to 
prepare  the  way  for  him.  Isaiah  described  the  preparation 
for  the  Lord's  triumphal  march  and  John  used  it  with  great 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  39 

force.  Hill  (bounos).  Called  a  Cyrenaic  word  by  Herodotus, 
but  iater  Greek  writers  use  it  as  does  the  LXX.  Brought 
low  (tapeinbthesetai) .  Future  passive  indicative  of  tapeinob. 
Literal  meaning  here  of  a  verb  common  in  the  metaphorical 
sense.  Crooked  (skolia).  Common  word,  curved,  opposite  of 
orthos  or  euthus,  straight. 

6.  All  flesh  {pas a  sarx).  Used  in  the  N.T.  of  the  human 
race  alone,  though  in  the  LXX  brutes  are  included.  The 
salvation  of  God  (to  soterion  tou  theou).  The  saving  act  of 
God.  This  phrase  aptly  describes  Luke's  Gospel  which  has 
in  mind  the  message  of  Christ  for  all  men.  It  is  the  universal 
Gospel. 

7.  To  the  multitude  that  went  out  (tots  exporeuomenois  och- 
lois).  Plural,  Multitudes.  The  present  participle  also  notes 
the  repetition  of  the  crowds  as  does  elegen  (imperfect),  he 
used  to  say.  Matt.  3  :j  to  10  singles  out  the  message  of 
John  to  the  Pharisees  and  Sadducees,  which  see  for  discussion 
of  details.  Luke  gives  a  summary  of  his  preaching  to  the 
crowds  with  special  replies  to  these  inquiries:  the  multitudes, 
10  and  11,  the  publicans  12  and  13,  the  soldiers  14.  To  be 
baptized  of  him  (baptisthenai  hup'  autou).  This  is  the  purpose 
of  their  coming.  Matt.  3:7  has  simply  "to  his  baptism." 
John's  metaphors  are  from  the  wilderness  (vipers,  fruits,  axe, 
slave  boy  loosing  sandals,  fire,  fan,  thrashing-floor,  garner, 
chaff,  stones).  Who  warned  you?  (tis  hepedeixen  humin;). 
The  verb  is  like  our  "suggest"  by  proof  to  eye,  ear,  or  brain 
(Luke  6:47;  12:5;  Acts  9:16;  20:35;  Matt.  3:7).  Nowhere 
else  in  the  N.T.  though  common  ancient  word  (hupodeik- 
numi,  show  under,  point  out,  give  a  tip  or  private  hint). 

10.  Asked  (eperbtbn).  Imperfect  tense,  repeatedly  asked. 
What  then  must  we  do?(ti  oun  poiesbmen;).  Deliberative 
aorist  subjunctive.  More  exactly,  What  then  are  we  to  do. 
What  then  shall  we  do?  Same  construction  in  verses  12  and 
14.  The  oun  refers  to  the  severe  things  already  said  by 
John  (Luke  3  7"9)- 


40        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

11.  Coats  (chitonas).  The  inner  and  less  necessary  under- 
garment. The  outer  indispensable  himation  is  not  mentioned. 
Note  the  specific  and  different  message  to  each  class.  John 
puts  his  finger  on  the  weaknesses  of  the  people  right  before 
him. 

12.  Also  publicans  (kai  telonai).  We  have  had  the  word 
already  in  Matthew  (5:46;  9:10;  11:19;  18:17;  2l:3lf.)  and 
Mark  (1 1  :i 5f.)«  It  is  sometimes  coupled  with  harlots  and 
other  sinners,  the  outcasts  of  society.  The  word  is  made  up 
from  telos,  tax,  and  oneomai,  to  buy,  and  is  an  old  one.  The 
renter  or  collector  of  taxes  was  not  popular  anywhere,  but 
least  of  all  when  a  Jew  collected  taxes  for  the  Romans  and 
did  it  by  terrible  graft  and  extortions.  Extort  (prassete). 
The  verb  means  only  to  do  or  practice,  but  early  the  tax- 
collectors  learned  how  to  "do"  the  public  as  regular  "blood- 
suckers."   Lucian  links  them  with  crows  and  sycophants. 

14.  Soldiers  also  (kai  strateuomenoi).  Men  on  service, 
militantes  rather  than  milites  (Plummer).  So  Paul  in  II 
Tim.  2:4.  An  old  word  like  stratiotes,  soldier.  Some  of  these 
soldiers  acted  as  police  to  help  the  publicans.  But  they 
were  often  rough  and  cruel.  Do  violence  to  no  man  (medena 
diaseisete).  Here  only  in  the  N.T.,  but  in  the  LXX  and 
common  in  ancient  Greek.  It  means  to  shake  (seismic  dis- 
turbance, earthquake)  thoroughly  (dia)  and  so  thoroughly 
to  terrify,  to  extort  money  or  property  by  intimidating  (3 
Mace.  7:21).  The  Latin  employs  concutere,  so.  It  was  a 
process  of  blackmail  to  which  Socrates  refers  (Xenophon, 
Memorabilia,  ii.  9,  1).  This  was  a  constant  temptation  to 
soldiers.  Might  does  not  make  right  with  Jesus.  Neither 
exact  anything  wrongfully  (mede  sukophantesete).  In  Athens 
those  whose  business  it  was  to  inform  against  any  one  whom 
they  might  find  exporting  figs  out  of  Attica  were  called  fig- 
showers  or  sycophants  (sukophantai) .  From  sukon,  fig,  and 
phaino,  show.  Some  modern  scholars  reject  this  explana- 
tion since  no  actual  examples  of  the  word  meaning  merely 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  41 

a  fig-shower  have  been  found.  But  without  this  view  it  is 
all  conjectural.  From  the  time  of  Aristophanes  on  it  was 
used  for  any  malignant  informer  or  calumniator.  These 
soldiers  were  tempted  to  obtain  money  by  informing  against 
the  rich,  blackmail  again.  So  the  word  comes  to  mean  to 
accuse  falsely.  The  sycophants  came  to  be  a  regular  class 
of  informers  or  slanderers  in  Athens.  Socrates  is  quoted  by 
Xenophon  as  actually  advising  Crito  to  employ  one  in  self- 
defence,  like  the  modern  way  of  using  one  gunman  against 
another.  Demosthenes  pictures  a  sycophant  as  one  who 
"glides  about  the  market  like  a  scorpion,  with  his  venomous 
sting  all  ready,  spying  out  whom  he  may  surprise  with  mis-> 
fortune  and  ruin  and  from  whom  he  can  most  easily  extort 
money,  by  threatening  him  with  an  action  dangerous  in  its 
consequences"  (quoted  by  Vincent).  The  word  occurs  only 
in  Luke  in  the  N.T.,  here  and  in  Luke  19:8  in  the  confession 
of  Zaccheus.  It  occurs  in  the  LXX  and  often  in  the  old 
Greek.  Be  content  with  your  wages  (arkeisthe  tois  opsoniois 
humon).  Discontent  with  wages  was  a  complaint  of  mercen- 
ary soldiers.  This  word  for  wages  was  originally  anything 
cooked  {opson,  cooked  food),  and  bought  (from  oneomai,  to 
buy).  Hence,  "rations,"  "pay,"  wages.  Opsarion,  diminu- 
tive of  opson,  was  anything  eaten  with  bread  like  broiled  fish. 
So  opsonion  comes  to  mean  whatever  is  bought  to  be  eaten 
with  bread  and  then  a  soldier's  pay  or  allowance  (Polybius, 
and  other  late  Greek  writers)  as  in  I  Cor.  9:7.  Paul  uses 
the  singular  of  a  preacher's  pay  (II  Cor.  11 :8)  and  the  plural 
of  the  wages  of  sin  (Rom.  6:23)  =  death  (death  is  the  diet 
of  sin). 

15.  Were  in  expectation  (prosdokontos) .  Genitive  absolute 
of  this  striking  verb  already  seen  in  1 :2I.  Reasoned  (dialbgi- 
zomenon).  Genitive  absolute  again.  John's  preaching  about 
the  Messiah  and  the  kingdom  of  God  stirred  the  people 
deeply  and  set  them  to  wondering.  Whether  haply  he  were 
the  Christ  (mepote  autos  eie  ho  Christos).    Optative  eie  in  in- 


42        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

direct  question  changed  from  the  indicative  in  the  direct 
(Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  103 1).  John  wrought  no  miracles 
and  was  not  in  David's  line  and  yet  he  moved  people  so 
mightily  that  they  began  to  suspect  that  he  himself  (autos) 
was  the  Messiah.  The  Sanhedrin  will  one  day  send  a  formal 
committee  to  ask  him  this  direct  question  (John  1  :ig) . 

16.  He  that  is  mightier  than  I  {ho  ischuroteros  mou).  Like 
Mark  1:7,  "the  one  mightier  than  I."  Ablative  case  {mou) 
of  comparison.  John  would  not  turn  aside  for  the  flattery 
of  the  crowd.  He  was  able  to  take  his  own  measure  in  com- 
parison with  the  Messiah  and  was  loyal  to  him  (see  my  John 
the  Loyal).  Compare  Luke  3:16  with  Mark  i:yi.  and  Matt. 
3:1  if.  for  discussion  of  details.  Luke  has  "fire"  here  after 
"baptize  with  the  Holy  Ghost"  as  Matt.  3:11,  which  see. 
This  bold  Messianic  picture  in  the  Synoptic  Gospels  shows 
that  John  saw  the  Messiah's  coming  as  a  judgment  upon 
the  world  like  fire  and  the  fan  of  the  thrashing-floor,  and 
with  unquenchable  fire  for  the  chaff  (Luke  3:i7=Matt. 
3:12).  But  he  had  the  spiritual  conception  also,  the  bap- 
tism in  the  Holy  Spirit  which  will  characterize  the  Messiah's 
Mission  and  so  will  far  transcend  the  water  baptism  which 
marked  the  ministry  of  John. 

18.  Many  other  exhortations  {polla  men  oun  kai  hetera). 
Literally,  many  and  different  things  did  John  evangelize, 
euaggelizeto,  to  the  people.  Luke  has  given  a  bare  sample 
of  the  wonderful  messages  of  the  Baptist.  Few  as  his 
words  preserved  are  they  give  a  definite  and  powerful  con- 
ception of  his  preaching. 

19.  Reproved  {elegchomenos).  Present  passive  participle 
of  elegcho,  an  old  verb  meaning  in  Homer  to  treat  with  con- 
tempt, then  to  convict  (Matt.  18:15),  to  expose  (Eph.  5:11), 
to  reprove  as  here.  The  substantive  elegchos  means  proof 
(Heb.  1 1:1)  and  elegmos,  censure  (II  Tim.  3:16).  Josephus 
{Ant.  XVIII.  V.  4)  shows  how  repulsive  this  marriage  was 
to  Jewish  feeling.    Evil  things  {poneron).    Incorporated  into 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  43 

the  relative  sentence.  The  word  is  from  ponos,  ported,  toil, 
work,  and  gives  the  active  side  of  evil,  possibly  with  the  no- 
tion of  work  itself  as  evil  or  at  least  an  annoyance.  The 
"evil  eye"  (ophthalmos  poneros  in  Mark  7:22)  was  a  "mis- 
chief working  eye"  (Vincent).  In  Matt.  6:23  it  is  a  dis- 
eased eye.  So  Satan  is  "the  evil  one"  (Matt.  5:37;  6:13, 
etc.).  It  is  a  very  common  adjective  in  the  N.T.  as  in  the 
older  Greek.  Had  done  (epoiesen).  Aorist  active  indica- 
tive, not  past  perfect,  merely  a  summary  constative  aorist, 
he  did. 

20.  Added  (prosetheken).  First  aorist  active  indicative 
(kappa  aorist).  Common  verb  (prostithemi)  in  all  Greek. 
In  N.T.  chiefly  in  Luke  and  Acts.  Hippocrates  used  it  of 
applying  wet  sponges  to  the  head  and  Galen  of  applying 
a  decoction  of  acorns.  There  is  no  evidence  that  Luke  has 
a  medical  turn  to  the  word  here.  The  absence  of  the  con- 
junction hoti  (that)  before  the  next  verb  katekleisen  (shut  up) 
is  asyndeton.  This  verb  literally  means  shut  down,  possibly 
with  a  reference  to  closing  down  the  door  of  the  dungeon, 
though  it  makes  sense  as  a  perfective  use  of  the  preposition, 
like  our  "shut  up"  without  a  strict  regard  to  the  idea  of 
"down."  It  is  an  old  and  common  verb,  though  here  and 
Acts  26:10  only  in  the  N.T.  See  Matt.  14:3  for  further 
statement  about  the  prison. 

21.  When  all  the  people  were  baptised  (en  tot  baptisthenai 
hapanta  ton  laon).  The  use  of  the  articular  aorist  infinitive 
here  with  en  bothers  some  grammarians  and  commenta- 
tors. There  is  no  element  of  time  in  the  aorist  infinitive. 
It  is  simply  punctiliar  action,  literally  "in  the  being  bap- 
tized as  to  all  the  people."  Luke  does  not  say  that  all  the 
people  were  baptized  before  Jesus  came  or  were  baptized 
at  the  same  time.  It  is  merely  a  general  statement  that 
Jesus  was  baptized  in  connexion  with  or  at  the  time  of  the 
baptizing  of  the  people  as  a  whole.  Jesus  also  having  been 
battized  (kai  Iesou  baptisihentos) .     Genitive  absolute  con- 


44        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

struction,  first  aorist  passive  participle.  In  Luke's  sentence 
the  baptism  of  Jesus  is  merely  introductory  to  the  descent 
of  the  Holy  Spirit  and  the  voice  of  the  Father.  For  the 
narrative  of  the  baptism  see  Mark  1:9  and  Matt.  3:13-16. 
And  praying  (kai  proseuchomenou).  Alone  in  Luke  who  so 
often  mentions  the  praying  of  Jesus.  Present  participle  and 
so  naturally  meaning  that  the  heaven  was  opened  while 
Jesus  was  praying  though  not  necessarily  in  answer  to  his 
prayer.  The  heaven  was  opened  (anebichthenai  ton  our  anon). 
First  aorist  passive  infinitive  with  double  augment,  whereas 
the  infinitive  is  not  supposed  to  have  any  augment.  The 
regular  form  would  be  anoichthenai  as  in  D  (Codex  Bezae). 
So  the  augment  appears  in  the  future  indicative  kateaxei 
(Matt.  12:20)  and  the  second  aorist  passive  subjunctive 
kateagbsin  (John  19:31).  Such  unusual  forms  appear  in  the 
Koine.  This  infinitive  here  with  the  accusative  of  general 
reference  is  the  subject  of  egeneto  (it  came  to  pass).  Matt. 
3:16  uses  the  same  verb,  but  Mark  1:10  has  schizomenous, 
rent  asunder. 

22.  Descended  (katabenai).  Same  construction  as  the  pre- 
ceding infinitive.  The  Holy  Ghost  (to  pneuma  to  hagion).  The 
Holy  Spirit.  Mark  1:10  has  merely  the  Spirit  (to  pneuma) 
while  Matt.  3  :i6  has  the  Spirit  of  God  (pneuma  theou).  In  a 
bodily  form  (sbmatikbi  eidei).  Alone  in  Luke  who  has  also 
"  as  a  dove"  (hbs  peristeran)  like  Matthew  and  Mark.  This 
probably  means  that  the  Baptist  saw  the  vision  that  looked 
like  a  dove.  Nothing  is  gained  by  denying  the  fact  or  possi- 
bility of  the  vision  that  looked  like  a  dove.  God  manifests 
his  power  as  he  will.  The  symbolism  of  the  dove  for  the 
Holy  Spirit  is  intelligible.  We  are  not  to  understand  that  this 
was  the  beginning  of  the  Incarnation  of  Christ  as  the  Cerin- 
thian  Gnostics  held.  But  this  fresh  influx  of  the  Holy  Spirit 
may  have  deepened  the  Messianic  consciousness  of  Jesus 
and  certainly  revealed  him  to  the  Baptist  as  God's  Son. 
And  a  voice  came  out  of  heaven  (kai  phonen  ex  ouranou  ge 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  45 

nesthai).  Same  construction  of  infinitive  with  accusative  of 
general  reference.  The  voice  of  the  Father  to  the  Son  is 
given  here  as  in  Mark  1:11,  which  see,  and  Matt.  3:17  for 
discussion  of  the  variation  there.  The  Trinity  here  mani- 
fest themselves  at  the  baptism  of  Jesus  which  constitutes 
the  formal  entrance  of  Jesus  upon  his  Messianic  ministry. 
He  enters  upon  it  with  the  Father's  blessing  and  approval 
and  with  the  power  of  the  Holy  Spirit  upon  him.  The  deity 
of  Christ  here  appears  in  plain  form  in  the  Synoptic  Gospels. 
The  consciousness  of  Christ  is  as  clear  on  this  point  here  as 
in  the  Gospel  of  John  where  the  Baptist  describes  him  after 
his  baptism  as  the  Son  of  God  (John  1:34). 

23.  Jesus  Himself  (autos  Iesous).  Emphatic  intensive 
pronoun  calling  attention  to  the  personality  of  Jesus  at  this 
juncture.  When  he  entered  upon  his  Messianic  work. 
When  he  began  to  teach  (archomenos) .  The  words  "to 
teach"  are  not  in  the  Greek  text.  The  Authorized  Version 
"began  to  be  about  thirty  years  of  age,"  is  an  impossible 
translation.  The  Revised  Version  rightly  supplies  "  to 
teach"  (didaskein)  after  the  present  participle  archomenos. 
Either  the  infinitive  or  the  participle  can  follow  archomai, 
usually  the  infinitive  in  the  Koine.  It  is  not  necessary  to 
supply  anything  (Acts  1:22).  Was  about  thirty  years  of  age 
{en  hosei  eton  triakonta).  Tyndale  has  it  right  "Jesus  was 
about  thirty  yere  of  age  when  he  beganne."  Luke  does  not 
commit  himself  definitely  to  precisely  thirty  years  as  the 
age  of  Christ.  The  Levites  entered  upon  full  service  at  that 
age,  but  that  proves  nothing  about  Jesus.  God's  prophets 
enter  upon  their  task  when  the  word  of  God  comes  to  them. 
Jesus  may  have  been  a  few  months  under  or  over  thirty  or 
a  year  or  two  less  or  more.  Being  Son  (as  was  supposed)  of 
Joseph,  the  son  of  Heli  (on  huios  hos  enomizeto  Ioseph  tou 
Helei).  For  the  discussion  of  the  genealogy  of  Jesus  see 
on  Matt.  1  n-iy.  The  two  genealogies  differ  very  widely 
and  many  theories  have  been  proposed  about  them.    At

once  one  notices  that  Luke  begins  with  Jesus  and  gees 
back  to  Adam,  the  Son  of  God,  while  Matthew  begins  with 
Abraham  and  comes  to  "Joseph  the  husband  of  Mary  of 
whom  was  born  Jesus  who  is  called  Christ"  (1:16).  Matthew 
employs  the  word  "begot"  each  time,  while  Luke  has  the 
article  ton  repeating  huiou  (Son)  except  before  Joseph.  They 
agree  in  the  mention  of  Joseph,  but  Matthew  says  that 
"Jacob  begat  Joseph"  while  Luke  calls  "Joseph  the  son  of 
Heli."  There  are  other  differences,  but' this  one  makes  one 
pause.  Joseph,  of  course,  did  not  have  two  fathers.  If  we 
understand  Luke  to  be  giving  the  real  genealogy  of  Jesus 
through  Mary,  the  matter  is  simple  enough.  The  two  gen- 
ealogies differ  from  Joseph  to  David  except  in  the  cases  of 
Zorobabel  and  Salathiel.  Luke  evidently  means  to  suggest 
something  unusual  in  his  genealogy  by  the  use  of  the  phrase 
"as  was  supposed"  (hos  enomizeto).  His  own  narrative  in 
Luke  1:26-38  has  shown  that  Joseph  was  not  the  actual 
father  of  Jesus.  Plummer  objects  that,  if  Luke  is  giving  the 
genealogy  of  Jesus  through  Mary,  huios  must  be  used  in 
two  senses  here  (son  as  was  supposed  of  Joseph,  and  grand- 
son through  Mary  of  Heli).  But  that  is  not  an  unheard  oi 
thing.  In  neither  list  does  Matthew  or  Luke  give  a  complete 
genealogy.  Just  as  Matthew  uses  "begat"  for  descent,  so 
does  Luke  employ  "son"  in  the  same  way  for  descendant. 
It  was  natural  for  Matthew,  writing  for  Jews,  to  give  the 
legal  genealogy  through  Joseph,  though  he  took  pains  to 
show  in  1:16  and  in  1:18-25  that  Joseph  was  not  the  actual 
father  of  Jesus.  It  was  equally  natural  for  Luke,  a  Greek 
himself  and  writing  for  the  whole  world,  to  give  the  actual 
genealogy  of  Jesus  through  Mary.  It  is  in  harmony  with 
Pauline  universality  (Plummer)  that  Luke  carries  the  gene- 
alogy back  to  Adam  and  does  not  stop  with  Abraham.  It 
is  not  clear  why  Luke  adds  "the  Son  of  God"  after  Adam 
(3:38).  Certainly  he  does  not  mean  that  Jesus  is  the  Son  of 
God  only  in  tne  sense  that  Adam  is.    Possibly  he  wishes  to 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  47 

dispose  of  the  heathen  myths  about  the  origin  of  man  and 
to  show  that  God  is  the  Creator  of  the  whole  human  race, 
Father  of  all  men  in  that  sense.  No  mere  animal  origin  of 
man  is  in  harmony  with,  this  conception. 


CHAPTER   IV 

I.  Full  of  the  Holy  Spirit  (pleres  pneumatos  hagiou).  An 
evident  allusion  to  the  descent  of  the  Holy  Spirit  on  Jesus 
at  his  baptism  (Luke  3  :2if.)-  The  distinctness  of  the  Per- 
sons in  the  Trinity  is  shown  there,  but  with  evident  unity. 
One  recalls  also  Luke's  account  of  the  overshadowing  of 
Mary  by  the  Holy  Spirit  (1 :35).  Matt.  4:1  says  that  "Jesus 
was  led  of  the  Spirit"  while  Mark  1  :I2  states  that  the  Spirit 
driveth  him  forth"  which  see  for  discussion.  "Jesus  had 
been  endowed  with  supernatural  power;  and  He  was  tempted 
to  make  use  of  it  in  furthering  his  own  interests  without  re- 
gard to  the  Father's  will"  (Plummer).  Was  led  by  the  Spirit 
(egeto  en  toi  pneumati).  Imperfect  passive,  continuously 
led.  En  may  be  the  instrumental  use  as  often,  for  Matt.  4:1 
has  here  hupo  of  direct  agency.  But  Matthew  has  the 
aorist  passive  anechthe  which  may  be  ingressive  as  he  has 
eis  ten  eremon  (into  the  wilderness)  while  Luke  has  en  toi 
eremoi  (in  the  wilderness).  At  any  rate  Luke  affirms  that 
Jesus  was  now  continuously  under  the  guidance  of  the  Holy 
Spirit.  Hence  in  this  same  sentence  he  mentions  the  Spirit 
twice.  During  the  forty  days  (hemeras  tesserakonta).  Ac- 
cusative of  duration  of  time,  to  be  connected  with  "led" 
not  with  "tempted."  He  was  led  in  the  Spirit  during  these 
forty  days  (cf.  Deut.  8:2,  forty  years).  The  words  are  am- 
phibolous also  in  Mark  1 113.  Matt.  4:2  seems  to  imply  that 
the  three  recorded  temptations  came  at  the  close  of  the 
fasting  for  forty  days.  That  can  be  true  and  yet  what  Luke 
states  be  true  also.  These  three  may  be  merely  specimens 
and  so  "representative  of  the  struggle  which  continued 
throughout  the  whole  period"  (Plummer).

GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  49 

ticiple  and  naturally  parallel  with  the  imperfect  passive 
egeto  (was  led)  in  verse  1.  This  is  another  instance  of  poor 
verse  division  which  should  have  come  at  the  end  of  the 
sentence.  See  on  Matt.  4:1  and  Mark  1:13  for  the  words 
"tempt"  and  "devil."  The  devil  challenged  the  Son  of 
man  though  also  the  Son  of  God.  It  was  a  contest  between 
Jesus,  full  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  and  the  slanderer  of  men. 
The  devil  had  won  with  Adam  and  Eve.  He  has  hopes  of 
triumph  over  Jesus.  The  story  of  this  conflict  is  given  only 
in  Matt.  4:1-11  and  Luke  4:1-13.  There  is  a  mere  mention 
of  it  in  Mark  1  :i2f.  So  then  here  is  a  specimen  of  the  Logia 
of  Jesus  (Q),  a  non-Ma rkan  portion  of  Matthew  and  Luke, 
the  earliest  document  about  Christ.  The  narrative  could 
come  ultimately  only  from  Christ  himself.  It  is  noteworthy 
that  it  bears  all  the  marks  of  the  high  conception  of  Jesus 
as  the  Son  of  God  found  in  the  Gospel  of  John  and  in  Paul 
and  Hebrews,  the  rest  of  the  New  Testament  in  fact,  for 
Mark,  Matthew,  Luke,  Acts,  Peter,  and  Jude  follow  in  this 
same  strain.  The  point  is  that  modern  criticism  has  revealed 
the  Messianic  consciousness  of  Jesus  as  God's  Son  at  his 
Baptism  and  in  his  Temptations  at  the  very  beginning  of 
his  ministry  and  in  the  oldest  known  documents  about 
Christ  (The  Logia,  Mark's  Gospel).  He  did  eat  nothing  (ouk 
ephagen  ouden).  Second  aorist  (constative)  active  indicative 
of  the  defective  verb  esthio.  Mark  does  not  give  the  fast. 
Matt.  4:2  has  the  aorist  active  participle  nesteusas  which 
usually  means  a  religious  fast  for  purposes  of  devotion.  That 
idea  is  not  excluded  by  Luke's  words.  The  entrance  of 
Jesus  upon  his  Messianic  ministry  was  a  fit  time  for  this 
solemn  and  intense  consecration.  This  mental  and  spiritual 
strain  would  naturally  take  away  the  appetite  and  there  was 
probably  nothing  at  hand  to  eat.  The  weakness  from  the 
absence  of  food  gave  the  devil  his  special  opportunity  to 
tempt  Jesus  which  he  promptly  seized.  When  they  were 
completed  (suntelestheison  autbn).    Genitive  absolute  with  the 


50        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

first  aorist  passive  participle  feminine  plural  because  hemerbn 
(days)  is  feminine.  According  to  Luke  the  hunger  (epeinasen, 
became  hungry,  ingressive  aorist  active  indicative)  came 
at  the  close  of  the  forty  days  as  in  Matt.  4:2. 

3.  The  Son  of God  (huios  tou  theou) .  No  article  as  in  Matt. 
4:3.  So  refers  to  the  relationship  as  Son  of  God  rather  than 
to  the  office  of  Messiah.  Manifest  reference  to  the  words 
of  the  Father  in  Luke  3 :22.  Condition  of  the  first  class  as 
in  Matthew.  The  devil  assumes  that  Jesus  is  Son  of  God. 
This  stone  (tbi  lithbi  toutbi).  Perhaps  pointing  to  a  particular 
round  stone  that  looked  in  shape  and  size  like  a  loaf  of  bread. 
Stanley  (Sinai  and  Palestine,  p.  154)  on  Mt.  Carmel  found 
crystallizations  of  stones  called  "Elijah's  melons."  The 
hunger  of  Jesus  opened  the  way  for  the  diabolic  suggestion 
designed  to  inspire  doubt  in  Jesus  toward  his  Father. 
Matthew  has  "these  stones."  Bread  (artos).  Better  " loaf ." 
For  discussion  of  this  first  temptation  see  on  Matt.  4  .-3 f . 
Jesus  felt  the  force  of  each  of  the  temptations  without  yield- 
ing at  all  to  the  sin  involved.  See  discussion  on  Matthew 
also  for  reality  of  the  devil  and  the  objective  and  subjective 
elements  in  the  temptations.  Jesus  quotes  Deut.  8:3  in 
reply  to  the  devil. 

5.  The  world  (tes  oikoumenes) .  The  inhabited  world.  In 
Matt.  4:8  it  is  tou  kosmou.  In  a  moment  of  time  (en  stigmei 
chronou).  Only  in  Luke  and  the  word  stigme  nowhere  else 
in  the  N.T.  (from  stizo,  to  prick,  or  puncture),  a  point  or 
dot.  In  Demosthenes,  Aristotle,  Plutarch.  Like  our  "sec- 
ond" of  time  or  tick  of  the  clock.  This  panorama  of  all  the 
kingdoms  of  the  world  and  the  glory  of  them  in  a  moment  of 
time  was  mental,  a  great  feat  of  the  imagination  (a  mental 
satanic  "movie"  performance),  but  this  fact  in  no  way 
discredits  the  idea  of  the  actual  visible  appearance  of  Satan 
also.  This  second  temptation  in  Luke  is  the  third  in  Mat- 
thew's order.  Luke's  order  is  geographical  (wilderness, 
mountain,  Jerusalem).     Matthew's  is  climacteric  (hunger, 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  51 

nervous  dread,  ambition).  There  is  a  climax  in  Luke's  order 
also  (sense,  man,  God).  There  is  no  way  to  tell  the  actual 
order. 

6.  All  this  authority  {ten  exousian  tauten  hapasan).  Matt. 
4:9  has  "all  these  things."  Luke's  report  is  more  spe- 
cific. And  the  glory  of  them  {kai  ten  doxan  auibn).  Matt. 
4:8  has  this  in  the  statement  of  what  the  devil  did,  not  what 
he  said.  For  it  hath  been  delivered  unto  me  {hoti  emoi  parade- 
dotai).  Perfect  passive  indicative.  Satan  here  claims  pos- 
session of  world  power  and  Jesus  does  not  deny  it.  It  may 
be  due  to  man's  sin  and  by  God's  permission.  Jesus  calls 
Satan  "the  ruler  of  this  world"  (John  12:31,  14:30,  16:11). 
To  whomsoever  I  will  {hoi  an  thelo).  Present  subjunctive 
with  an  in  an  indefinite  relative  sentence.  This  audacious 
claim,  if  allowed,  makes  one  wonder  whether  some  of  the 
world  rulers  are  not,  consciously  or  unconsciously,  agents  of 
the  devil.  In  several  American  cities  there  has  been  proven 
a  definite  compact  between  the  police  and  the  underworld  of 
crime.  But  the  tone  of  Satan  here  is  one  of  superiority  to 
Jesus  in  world  power.  He  offers  him  a  share  in  it  on  one 
condition. 

7.  Wilt  worship  before  me  {proskuneseis  enopion  emou). 
Matt.  4:9  has  it  more  bluntly  "worship  me."  That  is 
what  it  really  comes  to,  though  in  Luke  the  matter  is  more 
delicately  put.  It  is  a  condition  of  the  third  class  {ean  and 
the  subjunctive).  Luke  has  it  "thou  therefore  if"  {su  oun 
ean),  in  a  very  emphatic  and  subtle  way.  It  is  the  ingressive 
aorist  {proskuneseis),  just  bow  the  knee  once  up  here  in  my 
presence.  The  temptation  was  for  Jesus  to  admit  Satan's 
authority  by  this  act  of  prostration  (fall  down  and  worship), 
a  recognition  of  authority  rather  than  of  personal  merit. 
It  shall  all  be  thine  {estai  sou  pas  a).  Satan  offers  to  turn  over 
all  the  keys  of  world  power  to  Jesus.  It  was  a  tremendous 
grand-stand  play,  but  Jesus  saw  at  once  that  in  that  case 
he  would  be  the  agent  of  Satan  in  the  rule  of  the  world  by 


52        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

bargain  and  graft  instead  of  the  Son  of  God  by  nature  and 
world  ruler  by  conquest  over  Satan.  The  heart  of  Satan's 
program  is  here  laid  bare.  Jesus  here  rejected  the  Jewish 
idea  of  the  Messiah  as  an  earthly  ruler  merely.  "He  rejects 
Satan  as  an  ally,  and  thereby  has  him  as  an  implacable 
enemy"  (Plummer.) 

8.  Thou  shall  worship  (proskuneseis).  Satan  used  this  verb 
to  Jesus  who  turns  it  against  him  by  the  quotation  from 
Deut.  6:13.  Jesus  clearly  perceived  that  one  could  not 
worship  both  Satan  and  God.  He  had  to  choose  whom  he 
would  serve.  Luke  does  not  give  the  words,  "Get  thee 
hence,  Satan"  (Matt.  4:10),  for  he  has  another  temptation 
to  narrate. 

9.  Led  him  (egagen).  Aorist  active  indicative  of  ago. 
Matt.  4:5  has  paralambanei  (dramatic  present).  The  wing  of 
the  temple  {to  pterugion  tou  hierou).  See  on  Matt.  4:5.  It  is 
not  easy  to  determine  precisely  what  it  was.  From  hence  (en- 
teuthen).  This  Luke  adds  to  the  words  in  Matthew,  which 
see.  To  guard  thee  (tou  diaphulaxai  se).  Not  in  Matt.  4:6 
quoted  by  Satan  from  Psa.  91:11  and  12.  Satan  does  not 
misquote  this  Psalm,  but  he  misapplies  it  and  makes  it  mean 
presumptuous  reliance  on  God.  This  compound  verb  is  very 
old,  but  occurs  here  alone  in  the  N.T.  and  that  from  the 
LXX.  Luke  repeats  hoti  (recitative  hoti  after  gegraptai,  is 
written)  after  this  part  of  the  quotation. 

12.  It  is  said  (eiretai).  Perfect  passive  indicative,  stands 
said,  a  favourite  way  of  quoting  Scripture  in  the  N.T.  In 
Matt.  4:7  we  have  the  usual  "it  is  written"  (gegraptai). 
Here  Jesus  quotes  Deut.  6:16.  Each  time  he  uses  Deuter- 
onomy against  the  devil.  The  LXX  is  quoted.  It  is  the 
volitive  future  indicative  with  ouk,  a  common  prohibition. 
Jesus  points  out  to  the  devil  that  testing  God  is  not  trusting 
God  (Plummer). 

13.  Every  temptation  (pantap eir as mon).  These  three  kinds 
exhaust  the  avenues  of  approach  (the  appetites,  the  nerves, 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  53 

the  ambitions).  Satan  tried  them  all.  They  formed  a  cycle 
(Vincent).  Hence  "he  was  in  all  points  tempted  like  as  we 
are"  (Heb.  4:15).  "The  enemy  tried  all  his  weapons,  and 
was  at  all  points  defeated"  (Plummer).  Probably  all  during 
the  forty  days  the  devil  tempted  him,  but  three  are  repre- 
sentatives of  all.  For  a  season  {achri  kairou).  Until  a  good 
opportunity  should  return,  the  language  means.  We  are 
thus  to  infer  that  the  devil  returned  to  his  attack  from  time 
to  time.  In  the  Garden  of  Gethsemane  he  tempted  Jesus 
more  severely  than  here.  He  was  here  trying  to  thwart  the 
purpose  of  Jesus  to  go  on  with  his  Messianic  plans,  to  trip 
him  at  the  start.  In  Gethsemane  the  devil  tried  to  make 
Jesus  draw  back  from  the  culmination  of  the  Cross  with  all 
its  agony  and  horror.  The  devil  attacked  Jesus  by  the  aid 
of  Peter  (Mark  8:33),  through  the  Pharisees  (John  8:4on\), 
besides  Gethsemane  (Luke  22:42,  53). 

14.  Returned  {hup e strep  sen).  Luke  does  not  fill  in  the  gap 
between  the  temptations  in  the  wilderness  of  Judea  and  the 
Galilean  Ministry.  He  follows  the  outline  of  Mark.  It  is 
John's  Gospel  alone  that  tells  of  the  year  of  obscurity 
(Stalker)  in  various  parts  of  the  Holy  Land.  In  the  power  of 
the  Spirit  {en  tei  dunamei  tou  pneumatos).  Luke  in  these  two 
verses  (14  and  15)  gives  a  description  of  the  Galilean  Min- 
istry with  three  marked  characteristics  (Plummer) :  the 
power  of  the  spirit,  rapid  spread  of  Christ's  fame,  use  of  the 
Jewish  synagogues.  Luke  often  notes  the  power  of  the 
Holy  Spirit  in  the  work  of  Christ.  Our  word  dynamite  is 
this  same  word  dunamis  (power) .  A  fame  {pheme) .  An  old 
Greek  word  found  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Matt.  9:26. 
It  is  from  phemi,  to  say.  Talk  ran  rapidly  in  every  direction. 
It  assumes  the  previous  ministry  as  told  by  John. 

15.  And  he  taught  {kai  autos  edidasken) .  Luke  is  fond  of 
this  mode  of  transition  so  that  it  is  not  certain  that  he  means 
to  emphasize  "he  himself"  as  distinct  from  the  rumour  about 
him.     It  is  the  imperfect  tensea  descriptive  of  the  habit  of 


54        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Jesus.  The  synagogues  were  an  open  door  to  Jesus  before 
the  hostility  of  the  Pharisees  was  aroused.  Being  glorified 
(doxazomenos) .  Present  passive  participle,  durative  action 
like  the  imperfect  edidasken.  General  admiration  of  Jesus 
everywhere.  He  was  the  wonder  teacher  of  his  time.  Even 
the  rabbis  had  not  yet  learned  how  to  ridicule  and  oppose 
Jesus. 

16.  Where  he  had  been  brought  up  (hou  en  tethrammenos). 
Past  perfect  passive  periphrastic  indicative,  a  state  of  com- 
pletion in  past  time,  from  trepho,  a  common  Greek  verb. 
This  visit  is  before  that  recorded  in  Mark  6:i-6  =  Matt. 
13:54-58  which  was  just  before  the  third  tour  of  Galilee. 
Here  Jesus  comes  back  after  a  year  of  public  ministry  else- 
where and  with  a  wide  reputation  (Luke  4:15).  Luke  may 
have  in  mind  2:51,  but  for  some  time  now  Nazareth  had  not 
been  his  home  and  that  fact  may  be  implied  by  the  past 
perfect  tense.  As  his  custom  was  (kata  to  eibthos  autoi).  Sec- 
ond perfect  active  neuter  singular  participle  of  an  old  etho 
(Homer),  to  be  accustomed.  Literally  according  to  what 
was  customary  to  him  (autoi,  dative  case).  This  is  one  of 
the  flashlights  on  the  early  life  of  Jesus.  He  had  the  habit  of 
going  to  public  worship  in  the  synagogue  as  a  boy,  a  habit 
that  he  kept  up  when  a  grown  man.  If  the  child  does  not 
form  the  habit  of  going  to  church,  the  man  is  almost  certain 
not  to  have  it.  We  have  already  had  in  Matthew  and  Mark 
frequent  instances  of  the  word  synagogue  which  played  such 
a  large  part  in  Jewish  life  after  the  restoration  from  Babylon. 
Stood  up  (aneste).  Second  aorist  active  indicative  and  in- 
transitive. Very  common  verb.  It  was  the  custom  for  the 
reader  to  stand  except  when  the  Book  of  Esther  was  read 
at  the  feast  of  Purim  when  he  might  sit.  It  is  not  here 
stated  that  Jesus  had  been  in  the  habit  of  standing  up  to  read 
here  or  elsewhere.  It  was  his  habit  to  go  to  the  synagogue 
for  worship.  Since  he  entered  upon  his  Messianic  work  his 
habit  was  to  teach  in  the  synagogues  (Luke  4:15).    This  was 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  55 

apparently  the  first  time  that  he  had  done  so  in  Nazareth. 
He  may  have  been  asked  to  read  as  Paul  was  in  Antioch  in 
Pisidia  (Acts  13:15)-  The  ruler  of  the  synagogue  for  that 
day  may  have  invited  Jesus  to  read  and  speak  because  of  his 
now  great  reputation  as  a  teacher.  Jesus  could  have  stood  up 
voluntarily  and  appropriately  because  of  his  interest  in  his 
home  town.  To  read  (anagnbnai).  Second  aorist  active 
infinitive  of  anaginosko,  to  recognize  again  the  written  charac- 
ters and  so  to  read  and  then  to  read  aloud.  It  appears  first 
in  Pindar  in  the  sense  of  read  and  always  so  in  the  N.T. 
This  public  reading  aloud  with  occasional  comments  may 
explain  the  parenthesis  in  Matt.  24:15  (Let  him  that  readeth 
understand). 

.  17.  Was  delivered  (epedothe).  First  aorist  passive  indica- 
tive of  epididomi,  to  give  over  to,  a  common  verb.  At  the 
proper  stage  of  the  service  "the  attendant"  or  "minister" 
(huperetes,  under  rower)  or  "beadle"  took  out  a  roll  of  the 
law  from  the  ark,  unwrapped  it,  and  gave  it  to  some  one  to 
read.  On  sabbath  days  some  seven  persons  were  asked  to 
read  small  portions  of  the  law.  This  was  the  first  lesson  or 
Parashah.  This  was  followed  by  a  reading  from  the  prophets 
and  a  discourse,  the  second  lesson  or  Haphtarah.  This  last 
is  what  Jesus  did.  The  book  of  the  prophet  Isaiah  (biblion  ton 
prophetou  Esaiou).  Literally,  "  a  roll  of  the  prophet  Isaiah." 
Apparently  Isaiah  was  handed  to  Jesus  without  his  asking 
for  it.  But  certainly  Jesus  cared  more  for  the  prophets  than 
for  the  ceremonial  law.  It  was  a  congenial  service  that  he 
was  asked  to  perform.  Jesus  used  Deuteronomy  in  his 
temptations  and  now  Isaiah  for  this  sermon.  The  Syriac 
Sinaitic  manuscript  has  it  that  Jesus  stood  up  after  the  at- 
tendant handed  him  the  roll.  Opened  {anoixas).  Really  it 
was  unrolled  (anaptuxas)  as  Aleph  D  have  it.  But  the  more 
general  term  anoixas  (from  anoigo,  common  verb)  is  probably 
genuine.  Anaptussb  does  not  occur  in  the  N.T.  outside  of 
this  passage  if  genuine.    Found  the  place  (heuren  ton  topon).

Second  aorist  active  indicative.  He  continued  to  unroll 
(rolling  up  the  other  side)  till  he  found  the  passage  desired. 
It  may  have  been  a  fixed  lesson  for  the  day  or  it  may  have 
been  his  own  choosing.  At  any  rate  it  was  a  marvellously 
appropriate  passage  (Isa.  61  :i  and  2  with  one  clause  omitted 
and  some  words  from  58:6).  It  is  a  free  quotation  from  the 
Septuagint.  Where  it  was  written  (hou  en  gegrammenon). 
Periphrastic  pluperfect  passive  again  as  in  4:16. 

18.  Anointed  me  {echrisen  me).  First  aorist  active  indica- 
tive of  the  verb  chrib  from  which  Christ  (Christos)  is  derived, 
the  Anointed  One.  Isaiah  is  picturing  the  Jubilee  year  and 
the  release  of  captives  and  the  return  from  the  Babylonian 
exile  with  the  hope  of  the  Messiah  through  it  all.  Jesus  here 
applies  this  Messianic  language  to  himself.  "The  Spirit  of 
the  Lord  is  upon  me"  as  was  shown  at  the  baptism  (Luke 
3:21)  where  he  was  also  "anointed"  for  his  mission  by  the 
Father's  voice  (3:22).  To  the  poor  (ptochois).  Jesus  singles 
this  out  also  as  one  of  the  items  to  tell  John  the  Baptist  in 
prison  (Luke  7:22).  Our  word  Gospel  is  a  translation  of  the 
Greek  Euaggelion,  and  it  is  for  the  poor.  He  hath  sent  me 
(apestalken  me).  Change  of  tense  to  perfect  active  indicative. 
He  is  now  on  that  mission  here.  Jesus  is  God's  Apostle  to 
men  (John  17:3,  Whom  thou  didst  send).  Proclaim  (ke- 
ruxai).  As  a  herald  like  Noah  (II  Pet.  2:5).  To  the  captives 
(aichmalotois).  Prisoners  of  war  will  be  released  (aichme, 
a  spear  point,  and  halotos,  from  haliskomai,  to  be  captured). 
Captured  by  the  spear  point.  Common  word,  but  here  only 
in  the  N.T.  Set  at  liberty  (aposteilai) .  First  aorist  active 
infinitive  of  apostello.  Same  verb  as  apestalken,  above. 
Brought  in  here  from  Isa.  58 :6.  Plummer  suggests  that  Luke 
inserts  it  here  from  memory.  But  Jesus  could  easily  have 
turned  back  the  roll  and  read  it  so.  Them  that  are  bruised 
(tethrausmenous).  Perfect  passive  participle  of  thraub,  an 
old  verb,  but  here  only  in  the  N.T.  It  means  to  break  in 
pieces,  broken  in  heart  and  often  in  body  as  well.    One  loves 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  57 

to  think  that  Jesus  felt  it  to  be  his  mission  to  mend  broken 
hearts  like  pieces  of  broken  earthenware,  real  rescue-mission 
work.  Jesus  mends  them  and  sets  them  free  from  their  lim- 
itations. 

19.  The  acceptable  year  of  the  Lord  (eniauton  Kuriou 
dekton).  He  does  not  mean  that  his  ministry  is  to  be  only 
one  year  in  length  as  Clement  of  Alexandria  and  Origen 
argued.  That  is  to  turn  figures  into  fact.  The  Messianic 
age  has  come,  Jesus  means  to  say.  On  the  first  day  of  the 
year  of  Jubilee  the  priests  with  sound  of  trumpet  proclaimed 
the  blessings  of  that  year  (Lev.  25:8-17).  This  great  pas- 
sage justly  pictures  Christ's  conception  of  his  mission  and 
message. 

20.  He  closed  the  book  {ptuxas  to  biblion).  Aorist  active 
participle  of  ptusso.  Rolled  up  the  roll  and  gave  it  back  to 
the  attendant  who  had  given  it  to  him  and  who  put  it  away 
again  in  its  case.  Sat  down  (ekathisen).  Took  his  seat  there 
as  a  sign  that  he  was  going  to  speak  instead  of  going  back 
to  his  former  seat.  This  was  the  usual  Jewish  attitude  for 
public  speaking  and  teaching  (Luke  5:3;  Matt.  5:1;  Mark 
4:1;  Acts  16:13).  Were  fastened  on  him  (esan  atenizontes 
autoi).  Periphrastic  imperfect  active  and  so  a  vivid  descrip- 
tion. Literally,  the  eyes  of  all  in  the  synagogue  were  gazing 
fixedly  upon  him.  The  verb  atenizo  occurs  in  Aristotle  and 
the  Septuagint.  It  is  from  the  adjective  atenes  and  that 
from  teino,  to  stretch,  and  copulative  or  intensive  a,  not  a 
privative.  The  word  occurs  in  the  N.T.  here  and  in  22:56, 
ten  times  in  Acts,  and  in  II  Cor.  3  :yt  13.  Paul  uses  it  of  the 
steady  eager  gaze  of  the  people  at  Moses  when  he  came  down 
from  the  mountain  when  he  had  been  communing  with  God. 
There  was  something  in  the  look  of  Jesus  here  that  held  the 
people  spellbound  for  the  moment,  apart  from  the  great 
reputation  with  which  he  came  to  them.  In  small  measure 
every  effective  speaker  knows  what  it  is  to  meet  the  eager 
expectations  of  an  audience.

21.  And  he  began  to  say  (erxato  de  legein).  Aorist  ingressive 
active  indicative  and  present  infinitive.  He  began  speaking. 
The  moment  of  hushed  expectancy  was  passed.  These  may- 
or may  not  be  the  first  words  uttered  here  by  Jesus.  Often 
the  first  sentence  is  the  crucial  one  in  winning  an  audience. 
Certainly  this  is  an  arresting  opening  sentence.  Hath  been 
fulfilled  (peplerotai).  Perfect  passive  indicative,  stands  ful- 
filled. "Today  this  scripture  (Isa.  61:1,  2,  just  read)  stands 
fulfilled  in  your  ears."  It  was  a  most  amazing  statement 
and  the  people  of  Nazareth  were  quick  to  see  the  Messianic 
claim  involved.  Jesus  could  only  mean  that  the  real  year  of 
Jubilee  had  come,  that  the  Messianic  prophecy  of  Isaiah 
had  come  true  today,  and  that  in  him  they  saw  the  Messiah 
of  prophecy.  There  are  critics  today  who  deny  that  Jesus 
claimed  to  be  the  Messiah.  To  be  able  to  do  that,  they  must 
reject  the  Gospel  of  John  and  all  such  passages  as  this  one. 
And  it  is  no  apocalyptic  eschatological  Messiah  whom  Jesus 
here  sets  forth,  but  the  one  who  forgives  sin  and  binds  up 
the  broken-hearted.  The  words  were  too  good  to  be  true 
and  to  be  spoken  here  at  Nazareth  by  one  of  their  own  towns- 


men 


22.  Bare  him  witness  (emarturoun) .  Imperfect  active, 
perhaps  inchoative.  They  all  began  to  bear  witness  that  the 
rumours  were  not  exaggerations  (4:14)  as  they  had  supposed, 
but  had  foundation  in  fact  if  this  discourse  or  its  start  was  a 
fair  sample  of  his  teaching.  The  verb  martureo  is  a  very  old 
and  common  one.  It  is  frequent  in  Acts,  Paul's  Epistles, 
and  the  Johannine  books.  The  substantive  martur  is  seen 
in  our  English  martyr,  one  who  witnesses  even  by  his  death 
to  his  faith  in  Christ.  And  wondered  {kai  ethaumazon). 
Imperfect  active  also,  perhaps  inchoative  also.  They  began 
to  marvel  as  he  proceeded  with  his  address.  This  verb  is  an 
old  one  and  common  in  the  Gospels  for  the  attitude  of  the 
people  towards  Jesus.  At  the  words  of  grace  (epi  tois  logois 
tes  charitos).    See  on  Luke  1 130,  2:52  for  this  wonderful  word 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  59 

charts  so  full  of  meaning  and  so  often  in  the  N.T.  The  gen- 
itive case  (case  of  genus  or  kind)  here  means  that  the  words 
that  came  out  of  the  mouth  of  Jesus  in  a  steady  stream 
(present  tense,  ekporeuomenois)  were  marked  by  fascination 
and  charm.  They  were  "winning  words"  as  the  context 
makes  plain,  though  they  were  also  "gracious"  in  the  Pauline 
sense  of  "grace."  There  is  no  necessary  antithesis  in  the 
ideas  of  graceful  and  gracious  in  these  words  of  Jesus.  Is 
not  this  Joseph's  son?  {Ouchi  huios  estin  Ioseph  houtos;). 
Witness  and  wonder  gave  way  to  bewilderment  as  they  be- 
gan to  explain  to  themselves  the  situation.  The  use  of  ouchi 
intensive  form  of  ouk  in  a  question  expects  the  answer 
"yes."  Jesus  passed  in  Nazareth  as  the  son  of  Joseph  as 
Luke  presents  him  in  3  123.  He  does  not  stop  here  to  correct 
this  misconception  because  the  truth  has  been  already  amply 
presented  in  1:28-38,  2:49.  This  popular  conception  of 
Jesus  as  the  son  of  Joseph  appears  also  in  John  1 145.  The 
puzzle  of  the  people  was  due  to  their  previous  knowledge  of 
Jesus  as  the  carpenter  (Mark  6:3;  the  carpenter's  son,  Matt. 
J3 :55)*  -^or  him  now  to  appear  as  the  Messiah  in  Nazareth 
where  he  had  lived  and  laboured  as  the  carpenter  was  a  phe- 
nomenon impossible  to  credit  on  sober  reflection.  So  the 
mood  of  wonder  and  praise  quickly  turned  with  whispers  and 
nods  and  even  scowls  to  doubt  and  hostility,  a  rapid  and 
radical  transformation  of  emotion  in  the  audience. 

23.  Doubtless  {pantos).  Adverb.  Literally,  at  any  rate, 
certainly,  assuredly.  Cf.  Acts  21:22,  28:4.  This  parable 
{ten  parabolen  tauten).  See  discussion  on  Matt.  13.  Here 
the  word  has  a  special  application  to  a  crisp  proverb  which 
involves  a  comparison.  The  word  physician  is  the  point  of 
comparison.  Luke  the  physician  alone  gives  this  saying  of 
Jesus.  The  proverb  means  that  the  physician  was  expected 
to  take  his  own  medicine  and  to  heal  himself.  The  word 
parabole  in  the  N.T.  is  confined  to  the  Synoptic  Gospels 
except  Heb.  9:9,  11:19.    This  use  for  a  proverb  occurs  also 


60        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

in  Luke  5:36,  6:39.  This  proverb  in  various  forms  appears 
not  only  among  the  Jews,  but  in  Euripides  and  Aeschylus 
among  the  Greeks,  and  in  Cicero's  Letters.  Hobart  quotes 
the  same  idea  from  Galen,  and  the  Chinese  used  to  demand 
it  of  their  physicians.  The  point  of  the  parable  seems  to  be 
that  the  people  were  expecting  him  to  make  good  his  claim 
to  the  Messiahship  by  doing  here  in  Nazareth  what  they 
had  heard  of  his  doing  in  Capernaum  and  elsewhere.  "Es- 
tablish your  claims  by  direct  evidence"  (Easton).  This  same 
appeal  (Vincent)  was  addressed  to  Christ  on  the  Cross  (Matt. 
27:40,  42).  There  is  a  tone  of  sarcasm  towards  Jesus  in 
both  cases.  Heard  done  (ekousamen  genomena) .  The  use 
of  this  second  aorist  middle  participle  genomena  after  ekousa- 
men is  a  neat  Greek  idiom.  It  is  punctiliar  action  in  indirect 
discourse  after  this  verb  of  sensation  or  emotion  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  pp.  1040-42,  1122-24).  Do  also  here  (poieson  kai 
hode).  Ingressive  aorist  active  imperative.  Do  it  here  in 
thy  own  country  and  town  and  do  it  now.  Jesus  applies  the 
proverb  to  himself  as  an  interpretation  of  their  real  atti- 
tude towards  himself. 

24.  And  he  said  (eipen  de).  Also  in  1:13.  The  interjection 
of  these  words  here  by  Luke  may  indicate  a  break  in  his  ad- 
dress, though  there  is  no  other  indication  of  an  interval  here. 
Perhaps  they  only  serve  to  introduce  solemnly  the  new 
proverb  like  the  words  Verily  I  say  unto  you  {amen  lego 
humin).  This  proverb  about  the  prophet  having  no  honour 
in  his  own  country  Jesus  had  already  applied  to  himself  ac- 
cording to  John  4:44.  Both  Mark  6:4  and  Matt.  13  157  give 
it  in  a  slightly  altered  form  on  the  last  visit  of  Jesus  to  Naz- 
areth. The  devil  had  tempted  Jesus  to  make  a  display  of 
his  power  to  the  people  by  letting  them  see  him  floating  down 
from  the  pinnacle  of  the  temple  (Luke  4:9-11). 

25.  Three  years  and  six  months  (ete  tria  kai  menas  hex). 
Accusative  of  duration  of  time  without  epi  (doubtful).  The 
same  period  is  given  in  James  5:17,  the  popular  Jewish  way 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  6l 

of  speaking.    In  I  Kings  18:1  the  rain  is  said  to  have  come 
in  the  third  year.    But  the  famine  probably  lasted  still  longer. 

26.  Unto  Zarephath  {eis  Sarepta).  The  modern  village 
Surafend  on  the  coast  road  between  Tyre  and  Sidon.  Unto 
a  woman  that  was  a  widow  {pros  gunaika  cheran).  Literally, 
unto  a  woman  a  widow  (like  our  vernacular  widow  woman). 
This  is  an  illustration  of  the  proverb  from  the  life  of  Elijah 
(I  Kings  17:8  and  9).  This  woman  was  in  the  land  of  Sidon 
or  Phoenicia,  a  heathen,  where  Jesus  himself  will  go  later. 

27.  In  the  time  of  EHsha  the  prophet  (epi  Elisaiou  tou 
prophetou).  This  use  of  epi  with  the  genitive  for  "in  the 
time  of"  is  a  good  Greek  idiom.  The  second  illustration  of 
the  proverb  is  from  the  time  of  Elisha  and  is  another  heathen, 
Naaman  the  Syrian  {Naiman  ho  Syros).  He  was  the  lone 
leper  that  was  cleansed  by  Elisha  (II  Kings  5:1,  14). 

28.  They  were  all  filled  with  wrath  (eplesthesan  pantes 
thumou).  First  aorist  passive  indicative  of  the  common 
verb  pimplemi  followed  by  the  genitive  case.  The  people 
of  Nazareth  at  once  caught  on  and  saw  the  point  of  these 
two  Old  Testament  illustrations  of  how  God  in  two  cases 
blessed  the  heathen  instead  of  the  Jewish  people.  The 
implication  was  evident.  Nazareth  was  no  better  than 
Capernaum  if  as  good.  He  was  under  no  special  obligation 
to  do  unusual  things  in  Nazareth  because  he  had  been  reared 
there.  Town  pride  was  insulted  and  it  at  once  exploded  in 
a  burst  of  rage. 

29.  They  rose  up  and  cast  him  forth  {anastantes  exebalon) . 
Second  aorist  ingressive  active  participle  and  second  aorist 
effective  active  indicative.  A  movement  towards  lynching 
Jesus.  Unto  the  brow  of  the  hill  (heos  ophruos  tou  orous). 
Eyebrow  (ophrus),  in  Homer,  then  any  jutting  prominence. 
Only  here  in  the  N.T.  Hippocrates  speaks  of  the  eyebrow 
hanging  over.  Was  built  (oikodometo) .  Past  perfect  indica- 
tive, stood  built.  That  they  might  throw  him  down  headlong 
(hoste  katakremnisai  auton).     Neat  Greek  idiom  with  hoste 


62        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

for  intended  result,  "so  as  to  cast  him  down  the  precipice." 
The  infinitive  alone  can  convey  the  same  meaning  (Matt. 
2:2;  20:28;  Luke  2:23).  Kremnos  is  an  overhanging  bank 
or  precipice  from  kremannumi,  to  hang.  Kata  is  down.  The 
verb  occurs  in  Xenophon,  Demosthenes,  LXX,  Josephus. 
Here  only  in  the  N.T.  At  the  southwest  corner  of  the  town 
of  Nazareth  such  a  cliff  today  exists  overhanging  the  Maro- 
nite  convent.  Murder  was  in  the  hearts  of  the  people.  By 
pushing  him  over  they  hoped  to  escape  technical  guilt. 

30.  He  went  his  way  (eporeueto).  Imperfect  tense,  he 
was  going  on  his  way. 

31.  Came  down  {katelthen).  Mark  1:21  has  the  historical 
present,  they  go  into  (eisporeuontai) .  Capernaum  (Tell 
Hum)  is  now  the  headquarters  of  the  Galilean  ministry, 
since  Nazareth  has  rejected  Jesus.  Luke  4:31-37  is  parallel 
with  Mark  1 :2i-28  which  he  manifestly  uses.  It  is  the  first 
of  Christ's  miracles  which  they  give.  Was  teaching  them  {en 
didaskbn  autous).  Periphrastic  imperfect.  Mark  has  edi- 
dasken  first  and  then  en  didaskbn.  "Them"  here  means  the 
people  present  in  the  synagogue  on  the  sabbath,  construction 
according  to  sense  as  in  Mark  1 :22. 

32.  Rest  of  the  sentence  as  in  Mark,  which  see,  except 
that  Luke  omits  "and  not  as  their  scribes"  and  uses  hoti  en 
instead  of  hbs  echbn. 

33.  Which  had  {echbn).  Mark  has  en.  A  spirit  of  an  un- 
clean demon  {pneuma  daimoniou  akathartou).  Mark  has 
"unclean  spirit."  Luke's  phrase  here  is  unique  in  this 
combination.  Plummer  notes  that  Matthew  has  daimonion 
ten  times  and  akatharton  twice  as  an  epithet  of  pneuma; 
Mark  has  daimonion  thirteen  times  and  akatharton  eleven 
times  as  an  epithet  of  pneuma.  Luke's  Gospel  uses  daimo- 
nion twenty-two  times  and  akatharton  as  an  epithet,  once  of 
daimonion  as  here  and  once  of  pneuma.  In  Mark  the  man 
is  in  {en)  the  power  of  the  unclean  spirit,  while  here  the  man 
"has"  a  spirit  of  an  unclean  demon.     With  a  loud  voice 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  63 

(phonei  megalei).     Not  in  Mark.     Really  a  scream  caused 
by  the  sudden  contact  of  the  demon  with  Jesus. 

34.  Ah!  (Ea).  An  interjection  frequent  in  the  Attic 
poets,  but  rare  in  prose.  Apparently  second  person  singular 
imperative  of  eao,  to  permit.  It  is  expressive  of  wonder, 
fear,  indignation.  Here  it  amounts  to  a  diabolical  screech. 
For  the  rest  of  the  verse  see  discussion  on  Mark  1 124  and 
Matt.  8 129.  The  muzzle  (phimos)  occurs  literally  in  I  Cor. 
9:9,  I  Tim.  5:18,  and  metaphorically  here  and  Mark  1:25, 
4:39,  Matt.   22:12. 

35.  Had  thrown  him  down  in  the  midst  (rhipsan  auton  eis 
to  meson).  First  aorist  (effective)  participle  of  rhipto,  an 
old  verb  with  violent  meaning,  to  fling,  throw,  hurl  off  or 
down.  Having  done  him  no  hurt  {meden  blapsan  auton). 
Luke  as  a  physician  carefully  notes  this  important  detail 
not  in  Mark.  Blapto,  to  injure,  or  hurt,  occurs  in  the  N.T. 
only  here  and  in  Mark  16:18,  though  a  very  common  verb 
in  the  old  Greek. 

36.  Amazement  came  iegeneto  thambos).  Mark  has  etham- 
bethesan.  They  spake  together  one  with  another  (sunelaloun 
pros  allelous).  Imperfect  indicative  active  and  the  recipro- 
cal pronoun.  Mark  has  simply  the  infinitive  sunzetein 
(question).  For  (hoti).  We  have  here  an  ambiguous  hoti 
as  in  1:45,  which  can  be  either  the  relative  "that"  or  the 
casual  hoti  "because"  or  "for,"  as  the  Revised  Version  has 
it.  Either  makes  good  sense.  Luke  adds  here  dunamei 
{with  power)  to  Mark's  "authority"  (exousian).  And  they 
come  out  (exerchontai).  So  Luke  where  Mark  has  "and  they 
obey  him"  (kai  upakouousin  autoi). 

37*  Went  forth  a  rumour  {exeporeueto  echos).  Imperfect 
middle,  kept  on  going  forth.  Our  very  word  echo  in  this 
word.  Late  Greek  form  for  echo  in  the  old  Greek.  Used 
for  the  roar  of  the  waves  on  the  shore.  So  in  Luke  21:25.

38.  He  rose  up  {anastas).  Second  aorist  active  participle 
of  anistemi,  a  common  verb.  B.  Weiss  adds  here  "from  the 
teacher's  seat."  Either  from  his  seat  or  merely  leaving  the 
synagogue.  This  incident  of  the  healing  of  Peter's  mother- 
in-law  is  given  in  Mark  1:29-34  and  Matt.  8:14-17,  which 
see  for  details.  Into  the  house  of  Simon  (eis  ten  oikian  Si-

Simon  and  Andrew"  (Mark  1:29).  Paul's  reference  to 
Peter's  wife  (I  Cor.  9:5)  is  pertinent.  They  lived  together 
in  Capernaum.  This  house  came  also  to  be  the  Capernaum 
home  of  Jesus.  Simon's  wife's  mother  {penthera  tou  Simbnos). 
The  word  penthera  for  mother-in-law  is  old  and  well  estab- 
lished in  usage.  Besides  the  parallel  passages  (Mark  1 :30; 
Matt.  8:14;  Luke  4:38)  it  occurs  in  the  N.T.  only  in  Luke 
12:53.  The  corresponding  word  pentheros,  father-in-law, 
occurs  in  John  18:13  alone  in  the  N.T.  Was  holden  with  a 
great  fever  {en  sunechomene  puretbi  megalbi).  Periphrastic 
imperfect  passive,  the  analytical  tense  accenting  the  continu- 
ous fever,  perhaps  chronic  and  certainly  severe.  Luke  em- 
ploys this  verb  nine  times  and  only  three  others  in  the  N.T. 
(Matt.  4:24  passive  with  diseases  here;  II  Cor.  5:14  active; 
Phil.  1:23  passive).  In  Acts  28:8  the  passive  "with  dysen- 
tery" is  like  the  construction  here  and  is  a  common  one 
in  Greek  medical  writers  as  in  Greek  literature  gener- 
ally. Luke  uses  the  passive  with  "fear,"  Luke  8:37,  the 
active  for  holding  the  hands  over  the  ears  (Acts  7:57)  and 
for  pressing  one  or  holding  together  (Luke  8:45;  19:43; 
22:63),  tne  direct  middle  for  holding  oneself  to  preach- 
ing (Acts  18:5).  It  is  followed  here  by  the  instrumental 
case.  Hobart  {Medical  Language  of  Luke,  p.  3)  quotes 
Galen  as  dividing  fevers  into  "great"  {megaloi)  and  "small" 
{smikroi). 

39.  He  stood  over  her  {epistas  epanb  autes).  Second  aorist 
active  participle.  Only  in  Luke.  Surely  we  are  not  to  take 
Luke  to  mean  that  Jesus  here  took  the  exorcist's  position 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  65 

and  was  rebuking  a  malignant  personality.  The  attitude 
of  Jesus  is  precisely  that  of  any  kindly  sympathetic  physi- 
cian. Mark  1:31  and  Matt.  8:15  mention  the  touch  of  her 
hand  rather  than  the  tender  look  over  her  head.  Rebuked 
(epetimesen).  Only  in  Luke.  Jesus  bade  the  fever  leave 
her  as  he  spoke  to  the  wind  and  the  waves  and  Luke  uses 
this  same  verb  (8:24).  Rose  up  and  ministered  (anastasa 
diekonei).  Second  aorist  active  participle  as  in  verse  38, 
but  inchoative  imperfect  tense  diekonei,  from  diakoneb  (note 
augment  of  compound  verb).  She  rose  up  immediately, 
though  a  long  high  fever  usually  leaves  one  very  weak.  The 
cure  was  instantaneous  and  complete.  She  began  to  minis- 
ter at  once  and  kept  it  up. 

40.  When  the  sun  was  setting  (dunontos  tou  heliou).  Geni- 
tive absolute  and  present  participle  (duno,  late  form  of  duo) 
picturing  the  sunset  scene.  Even  Mark  1:32  has  here  the 
aorist  indicative  edusen  (punctiliar  active).  It  was  not  only 
cooler,  but  it  was  the  end  of  the  sabbath  when  it  was  not  re- 
garded as  work  (Vincent)  to  carry  a  sick  person  (John  5:10). 
And  also  by  now  the  news  of  the  cure  of  the  demoniac  of 
Peter's  mother-in-law  had  spread  all  over  the  town.  Had 
(eichon).  Imperfect  tense  including  all  the  chronic  cases. 
With  divers  diseases  (nosois  poikilais).  Instrumental  case. 
For  "divers"  say  "many  coloured"  or  "variegated."  See  on 
Matt.  4:24;  Mark  1 134.  Brought  (egagon).  Constative  sum- 
mary second  aorist  active  indicative  like  Matt.  8:16,  pros- 
enegkan,  where  Mark  1 132  has  the  imperfect  epheron,  brought 
one  after  another.  He  laid  his  hands  on  every  one  of  them  and 
healed  them  {ho  de  heni  hekastbi  auton  las  chciras  tpititheis 
ether apeuen  autous).  Note  the  present  active  participle 
epititheis  and  the  imperfect  active  etherapeuen,  picturing  the 
healing  one  by  one  with  the  tender  touch  upon  each  one. 
Luke  alone  gives  this  graphic  detail  which  was  more  than  a 
mere  ceremonial  laying  on  of  hands.  Clearly  the  cures  of 
Jesus  reached  the  physical,  mental,  and  spiritual  planes  of

human  nature.    He  is  Lord  of  life  and  acted  here  as  Master 
of  each  case  as  it  came. 

41.  Came out(exercheto, singular, or exerchonto, plural).  Im- 
perfect tense,  repetition,  from  one  after  another.  Thou  art 
the  Son  of  God  (Su  ei  ho  huios  tou  theou).  More  definite 
statement  of  the  deity  of  Jesus  than  the  witness  of  the  demo- 
niac in  the  synagogue  (Luke  4:34  =  Mark  1:24),  like  the 
words  of  the  Father  (Luke  3  122)  and  more  so  than  the  con- 
dition of  the  devil  (Luke  4:3,  9).  In  the  Canterbury  Revi- 
sion "devils"  should  always  be  "demons"  (daimonia)  as 
here.  Suffered  them  not  to  speak  (ouk  eia  auta  lalein).  Im- 
perfect third  singular  active  of  eao,  very  old  and  common 
verb  with  syllabic  augment  ei.  The  tense  accents  the  con- 
tinued refusal  of  Jesus  to  receive  testimony  to  his  person 
and  work  from  demons.  Cf.  Matt.  8:4  to  the  lepers.  Be- 
cause they  knew  (hoti  eideisan).  Causal,  not  declarative, 
hoti.  Past  perfect  of  the  second  perfect  oida.  That  he  was 
the  Christ  (ton  Christon  auton  einai).  Infinitive  in  indirect 
assertion  with  the  accusative  of  general  reference.  Ton 
Christon  =the  Anointed,  the  Messiah. 

42.  When  it  was  day  (genomenes  hemeras).  Genitive  abso- 
lute with  aorist  middle  participle.  Mark  1:35  notes  it  was 
"a  great  while  before  day"  (which  see  for  discussion)  when 
Jesus  rose  up  to  go  after  a  restless  night.  No  doubt,  be- 
cause of  the  excitement  of  the  previous  sabbath  in  Caper- 
naum. He  went  out  to  pray  (Mark  1:35).  Sought  after 
him  (epezetoun  auton).  Imperfect  active  indicative.  The 
multitudes  kept  at  it  until  "they  came  unto  him"  (elthon 
heos  atitou,  auiibt  active  indicative).  They  accomplished 
their  purpose,  heos  autou,  right  up  to  him.  Would  have 
stayed  him  (kateichon  auton).  Better,  They  tried  to  hinder 
him.  The  conative  imperfect  active  of  katecho,  an  old  and 
common  verb.  It  means  either  to  hold  fast  (Luke  8:15),  to 
take,  get  possession  of  (Luke  14:9)  or  to  hold  back,  to  re- 
tain, to  restrain  (Philem.  13;  Rom.  1:18;  7:6;  II  Thess.  2:6; 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  67 

Luke  4:42).  In  this  passage  it  is  followed  by  the  ablative 
case.  That  he  should  not  go  from  them  (tou  me  poreuesthai 
ap*  autbn).  Literally,  "from  going  away  from  them."  The 
use  of  me  (not)  after  kateichon  is  the  neat  Greek  idiom  of  the 
redundant  negative  after  a  verb  of  hindering  like  the  French 
ne  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1171). 

43.  /  must  (me  dei).  Jesus  felt  the  urge  to  go  with  the 
work  of  evangelism  "to  the  other  cities  also,"  to  all,  not  to 
a  favoured  few.  For  therefore  was  I  sent  (hoti  epi  touto 
apestalen).  "A  phrase  of  Johannine  ring"  (Ragg).  Second 
aorist  passive  indicative  of  apostellb.  Christ  is  the  great 
Apostle  of  God  to  men. 

44.  Was  preaching  (en  kerusson).  Periphrastic  imperfect 
active,  describing  his  first  tour  of  Galilee  in  accord  with  the 
purpose  just  stated.  One  must  fill  in  details,  though  Mark 
1:39  and  Matt.  8:23-25  tell  of  the  mass  of  work  done  on 
this  campaign. 


CHAPTER  V 

I.  Pressed  upon  him  {epikeisthai).  Luke  in  this  paragraph 
(5:1-11;  Mark  1:16-20;  Matt.  4:18-22)  does  not  follow  the 
chronology  of  Mark  as  he  usually  does.  It  seems  reasonably 
clear  that  the  renewed  call  of  the  four  fishermen  came  before 
the  first  tour  of  Galilee  in  Luke  4:42-44.  It  is  here  assumed 
that  Luke  is  describing  in  his  own  way  the  incident  given  in 
Mark  and  Matthew  above.  Luke  singles  out  Simon  in  a 
graphic  way.  This  verb  epikeisthai  is  an  old  one  and  means  to 
lie  upon,  rest  upon  as  of  a  stone  on  the  tomb  (John  11 138)  or 
of  fish  on  the  burning  coals  (John  21:9).  So  it  is  used  of  a 
tempest  (Acts  27:20)  and  of  the  urgent  demands  for  Christ's 
crucifixion  (Luke  23:23).  Here  it  vividly  pictures  the  eager 
crowds  around  Jesus.  En  tbi  epikeisthai  is  a  favourite  idiom 
with  Luke  as  we  have  already  seen,  en  with  the  articular 
infinitive  in  the  locative  case.  That  (kai).  Kai  does  not 
technically  mean  the  declarative  conjunction  "that,"  but 
it  is  a  fair  rendering  of  the  somewhat  awkward  idiom  of  Luke 
to  a  certain  extent  imitating  the  Hebrew  use  of  wav.  Was 
standing  {en  hestos).  Periphrastic  second  past  perfect  of 
histemi  which  here  is  equal  to  a  practical  imperfect.  By  the 
lake  {para  ten  limnen).  The  use  of  the  accusative  with  para, 
alongside,  after  a  verb  of  rest  used  to  be  called  the  pregnant 
use,  came  and  was  standing.  But  that  is  no  longer  necessary, 
for  the  accusative  as  the  case  of  extension  is  the  oldest  of  the 
cases  and  in  later  Greek  regains  many  of  the  earlier  uses  of 
the  other  cases  employed  for  more  precise  distinctions.  See 
the  same  idiom  in  verse  2.  We  need  not  here  stress  the 
notion  of  extension.  "With  characteristic  accuracy  Luke 
never  calls  it  a  sea,  while  the  others  never  call  it  a  lake" 
(Plummer).

2.  Two  boats  (ploia  duo).  Some  MSS.  have  ploiaria,  little 
boats,  but  ploia  was  used  of  boats  of  various  sizes,  even  of 
ships  like  nees.  The  fishermen  {hoi  haleeis).  It  is  an  old 
Homeric  word  that  has  come  back  to  common  use  in  the 
Koine.  It  means  "sea-folk"  from  hals,  sea.  Were  washing 
(eplunon).  Imperfect  active,  though  some  MSS.  have  aorist 
eplunan.  Vincent  comments  on  Luke's  use  of  five  verbs  for 
washing:  this  one  for  cleaning,  apomasso  for  wiping  the  dust 
from  one's  feet  (10:11),  ekmasso  of  the  sinful  woman  wiping 
Christ's  feet  with  her  hair  (7 :38,  44),  apoloub  of  washing  away 
sins  (symbolically,  of  course)  as  in  Acts  22:16,  and  loud  of 
washing  the  body  of  Dorcas  (Acts  9:37)  and  the  stripes  of 
the  prisoners  (Acts  16:33).  On  "nets"  see  on  Matt.  4:20, 
Mark  1:18. 

3.  To  put  out  a  little  {epanagagein  oligon).  Second  aorist 
infinitive  of  the  double  compound  verb  ep-an-ago,  found  in 
Xenophon  and  late  Greek  writers  generally.  Only  twice  in 
the  N.T.  In  Matt.  21:18  in  the  sense  of  leading  back  or 
returning  and  here  in  the  sense  of  leading  a  ship  up  upon  the 
sea,  to  put  out  to  sea,  a  nautical  term.  Taught  (edikasken). 
Imperfect  active,  picturing  Jesus  teaching  from  the  boat  in 
which  he  was  seated  and  so  safe  from  the  jam  of  the  crowd. 
"Christ  uses  Peter's  boat  as  a  pulpit  whence  to  throw  the  net 
of  the  Gospel  over  His  hearers"  (Plummer). 

4.  Had  left  speaking  {epausato  lalon).  He  ceased  speaking 
(aorist  middle  indicative  and  present  active  participle, 
regular  Greek  idiom).  Put  out  into  the  deep  (epanagage  eis 
to  bathos).  The  same  double  compound  verb  as  in  verse  3, 
only  here  second  aorist  active  imperative  second  person 
singular.  Let  down  (chalasate).  Peter  was  master  of  the 
craft  and  so  he  was  addressed  first.  First  aorist  active  im- 
perative second  person  plural.  Here  the  whole  crew  are 
addressed.  The  verb  is  the  regular  nautical  term  for  lowering 
cargo  or  boats  (Acts  27:17,  30).  But  it  was  used  for  lowering 
anything  from  a  higher  place  (Mark  2:4;  Acts  9:25;  II  Cor. 


70        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

11:33).     For  a  catch   (eis  agran).     This  purpose  was   the 
startling  thing  that  stirred  up  Simon. 

5.  Master  {epistata).  Used  only  by  Luke  in  the  N.T.  and 
always  in  addresses  to  Christ  (8:24,  45;  9:33,  49;  17:13). 
Common  in  the  older  writers  for  superintendent  or  overseer 
(one  standing  over  another).  This  word  recognizes  Christ's 
authority.  We  toiled  (kopias  antes).  This  verb  is  from  kopos 
(work,  toil)  and  occurs  from  Aristophanes  on.  It  used  to  be 
said  that  the  notion  of  weariness  in  toil  appears  only  in  the 
LXX  and  the  N.T.  But  Deissmann  (Light  from  the  Ancient 
East,  pp.  3  I2f.)  cites  examples  from  inscriptions  on  tomb- 
stones quite  in  harmony  with  the  use  in  the  N.T.  Peter's 
protest  calls  attention  also  to  the  whole  night  of  fruitless 
toil.  But  at  thy  word  (epi  de  toi  rhemati  sou).  On  the  base 
of  epi.  Acquiescence  to  show  his  obedience  to  Christ  as 
"Master,"  but  with  no  confidence  whatsoever  in  the  wisdom 
of  this  particular  command.  Besides,  fishing  in  this  lake  was 
Peter's  business  and  he  really  claimed  superior  knowledge 
on  this  occasion  to  that  of  Jesus. 

6.  They  inclosed  (sunekleisan).  Effective  aorist  active 
indicative  with  perfective  compound  sun.  They  shut  to- 
gether. Were  breaking  (dieresseto) .  Imperfect  passive  singular 
(diktua  being  neuter  plural).  This  is  the  late  form  of  the  old 
verb  diaregnumi.  The  nets  were  actually  tearing  in  two 
(dia-)  and  so  they  would  lose  all  the  fish. 

7.  They  beckoned  (kateneusan).  Possibly  they  were  too  far 
away  for  a  call  to  be  understood.  Simon  alone  had  been 
ordered  to  put  out  into  the  deep.  So  they  used  signs.  Unto 
their  partners  (tois  metechois).  This  word  metochos,  from 
metecho,  to  have  with,  means  participation  with  one  in  common 
blessings  (Heb.  3:1,  14;  6:4;  12:8).  While  koinbnos  (verse 
10  here  of  James  and  John  also)  has  the  notion  of  personal 
fellowship,  partnership.  Both  terms  are  here  employed  of 
the  two  pairs  of  brothers  who  have  a  business  company  under 
Simon's    lead.      Help    them    (sullabesthai).      Second    aorist 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  71 

middle  infinitive.  Take  hold  together  with  and  so  to  help. 
Paul  uses  it  in  Phil.  4:3.  It  is  an  old  word  that  was  some- 
times employed  for  seizing  a  prisoner  (Luke  22:54)  and  for 
conception  icon-capio)  by  a  woman  (Luke  1:24).  So  that 
they  began  to  sink  {hoste  buthizesthai  autd).  Consecutive  use 
of  hoste  and  the  infinitive  (present  tense,  inchoative  use, 
beginning  to  sink).  An  old  verb  from  buthos.  In  the  N.T. 
only  here  and  I  Tim.  6:9. 

8.  Fell  down  at  Jesus''  knees  (prosepesen  tois  gonasin  Iesou). 
Just  like  Peter,  from  extreme  self-confidence  and  pride 
(verse  5)  to  abject  humilation.  But  his  impulse  here  was 
right  and  sincere.  His  confession  was  true.  He  was  a  sinful 
man. 

9.  For  he  was  amazed  (thambos  gar  perieschen).  Literally, 
For  a  wonder  held  him  round.  Aorist  active  indicative.  It 
held  Peter  fast  and  all  the  rest. 

10.  Thou  shalt  catch  men  (esei  zogron).  Periphrastic  future 
indicative,  emphasizing  the  linear  idea.  The  old  verb 
Zogreo  means  to  catch  alive,  not  to  kill.  So  then  Peter  is  to 
be  a  catcher  of  men,  not  of  fish,  and  to  catch  them  alive  and 
for  life,  not  dead  and  for  death.  The  great  Pentecost  will 
one  day  prove  that  Christ's  prophecy  will  come  true.  Much 
must  happen  before  that  great  day.  But  Jesus  foresees  the 
possibilities  in  Simon  and  he  joyfully  undertakes  the  task 
of  making  a  fisher  of  men  out  of  this  poor  fisher  of  fish. 

11.  They  left  all,  and  followed  him  (aphentes  panta  ekolou- 
thesan).  Then  and  there.  They  had  already  become  his 
disciples.  Now  they  leave  their  business  for  active  service 
of  Christ.  The  conduct  of  this  group  of  business  men  should 
make  other  business  men  to  pause  and  see  if  Jesus  is  calling 
them  to  do  likewise. 

12.  Behold  (kai  idou).  Quite  a  Hebraistic  idiom,  this  use 
of  kai  after  egeneto  (almost  like  hoti)  with  idou  (interjection) 
and  no  verb.  Full  of  leprosy  (pleres  lepras).  Mark  1 140  and 
Matt.  8:2  have  simply  "a  leper"  which  see.     Evidently  a 


72        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

bad  case  full  of  sores  and  far  advanced  as  Luke  the  physician 
notes.  The  law  (Lev.  I3:i2f.)  curiously  treated  advanced 
cases  as  less  unclean  than  the  earlier  stages.  Fell  on  his  face 
(peson  epi  prosopon).  Second  aorist  active  participle  of 
pipto,  common  verb.  Mark  I  40  has  "kneeling"  (gonupetbn) 
and  Matt.  8:40  "worshipped"  (prosekunei).  All  three  atti- 
tudes were  possible  one  after  the  other.  All  three  Synoptics 
quote  the  identical  language  of  the  leper  and  the  identical 
answer  of  Jesus.  His  condition  of  the  third  class  turned  on 
the  "will"  (theleis)  of  Jesus  who  at  once  asserts  his  will 
(thelo)  and  cleanses  him.  All  three  likewise  mention  the 
touch  (hepsato,  verse  13)  of  Christ's  hand  on  the  unclean 
leper  and  the  instantaneous  cure. 

14.  To  tell  no  man  (medeni  eipein).  This  is  an  indirect 
command  after  the  verb  "charged"  (pareggeilen).  But 
Luke  changes  (constructio  variata)  to  the  direct  quotation, 
a  common  idiom  in  Greek  and  often  in  Luke  (Acts  1 :4f.). 
Here  in  the  direct  form  he  follows  Mark  1  43  and  Matt.  8:4. 
See  discussion  there  about  the  direction  to  go  to  the  priest 
to  receive  a  certificate  showing  his  cleansing,  like  our  release 
from  quarantine  (Lev.  13:39;  14:2-32).  For  a  testimony 
unto  them  (eis  marturion  autois).  The  use  of  autois  (them) 
here  is  "according  to  sense,"  as  we  say,  for  it  has  no  ante- 
cedent in  the  context,  just  to  people  in  general.  But  this 
identical  phrase  with  absence  of  direct  reference  occurs  in 
Mark  and  Matthew,  pretty  good  proof  of  the  use  of  one  by 
the  other.    Both  Matt.  8  4  and  Luke  5:14  follow  Mark  1  44. 

15.  So  much  the  more  (mdllon).  Mark  1:45  has  only 
"much"  (polla,  many),  but  Mark  tells  more  about  the  effect 
of  this  disobedience.  Went  abroad  (diercheto).  Imperfect 
tense.  The  fame  of  Jesus  kept  going.  Came  together  {suner- 
chonto).  Imperfect  tense  again.  The  more  the  report 
spread,  the  more  the  crowds  came. 

16.  But  he  withdrew  himself  in  the  deserts  and  prayed  (autos 
de  en  hupochorbn  en  tais  eremois  kai  proseuchomenos).    Peri- 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  73 

phrastic  imperfects.  Literally,  "But  he  himself  was  with- 
drawing in  the  desert  places  and  praying."  The  more  the 
crowds  came  as  a  result  of  the  leper's  story,  the  more  Jesus 
turned  away  from  them  to  the  desert  regions  and  prayed 
with  the  Father.  It  is  a  picture  of  Jesus  drawn  with  vivid 
power.  The  wild  enthusiasm  of  the  crowds  was  running 
ahead  of  their  comprehension  of  Christ  and  his  mission  and 
message.  Hupochoreo  (perhaps  with  the  notion  of  slipping 
away  secretly,  hupo-)  is  a  very  common  Greek  verb,  but  in 
the  N.T.  occurs  in  Luke  alone.  Elsewhere  in  the  N.T. 
anachoreo  (to  go  back)  appears. 

17.  That  (kai).  Use  of  kai=hoti  (that)  like  the  Hebrew 
zvav,  though  found  in  Greek  also.  He  (autos).  Luke  some- 
times has  autos  in  the  nominative  as  unemphatic  "he"  as 
here,  not  "he  himself."  Was  teaching  (en  didaskbn).  Peri- 
phrastic imperfect  again  like  our  English  idiom.  Were  sitting 
by  (esan  kathemenoi) .  Periphrastic  imperfect  again.  There 
is  no  "by"  in  the  Greek.  Doctors  of  the  law  (nomodidaskaloi) . 
A  compound  word  formed  after  analogy  of  hierodidaskalos, 
but  not  found  outside  of  the  N.T.  and  ecclesiastical  writers, 
one  of  the  very  few  words  apparently  N.T.  in  usage.  It 
appears  here  and  Acts  5:34  and  I  Tim.  1:7.  It  is  not  likely 
that  Luke  and  Paul  made  the  word,  but  they  simply  used  the 
term  already  in  current  use  to  describe  teachers  and  in- 
terpreters of  the  law.  Our  word  "doctor"  is  Latin  for 
"teacher."  These  "teachers  of  the  law"  are  called  elsewhere 
in  the  Gospels  "scribes"  (grammateis)  as  in  Matthew  and 
Mark  (see  on  Matt.  5 :20;  23  134)  and  Luke  5 :2i ;  19:47;  21  :i ; 
22:2.  Luke  also  employs  nomikos  (one  skilled  in  the  law, 
nomos)  as  in  10:25.  One  thinks  of  our  LL.D.  (Doctors  of 
Civil  and  Canon  Law),  for  both  were  combined  in  Jewish 
law.  They  were  usually  Pharisees  (mentioned  here  for  the 
first  time  in  Luke)  for  which  see  on  Matt.  3  7,  20.  Luke  will 
often  speak  of  the  Pharisees  hereafter.  Not  all  the  "Phar- 
isees" were  "teachers  of  the  law"  so  that  both  terms  often 


74        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

occur  together  as  in  verse  21  where  Luke  has  separate  ar- 
ticles (hoi  grammateis  kai  hoi  Pharisaioi),  distinguishing  be- 
tween them,  though  one  article  may  occur  as  in  Matt.  5 :20 
or  no  article  as  here  in  verse  17.  Luke  alone  mentions  the 
presence  here  of  these  Pharisees  and  doctors  of  the  law 
"which  were  come"  (hoi  esan  eleluthotes,  periphrastic  past 
perfect  active,  had  come).  Out  of  every  village  of  Galilee  and 
Judea  and  Jerusalem  (ek  pases  kbmes  tes  Galilaias  kai 
Ioudaias  kai  Ierousalem).  Edersheim  (Jewish  Social  Life) 
observes  that  the  Jews  distinguished  Jerusalem  as  a  separate 
district  in  Judea.  Plummer  considers  it  hyperbole  in  Luke 
to  use  "every  village."  But  one  must  recall  that  Jesus  had 
already  made  one  tour  of  Galilee  which  stirred  the  Pharisees 
and  rabbis  to  active  opposition.  Judea  had  already  been 
aroused  and  Jerusalem  was  the  headquarters  of  the  definite 
campaign  now  organized  against  Jesus.  One  must  bear  in 
mind  that  John  4:1-4  shows  that  Jesus  had  already  left 
Jerusalem  and  Judea  because  of  the  jealousy  of  the  Pharisees. 
They  are  here  on  purpose  to  find  fault  and  to  make  charges 
against  Jesus.  One  must  not  forget  that  there  were  many 
kinds  of  Pharisees  and  that  not  all  of  them  were  as  bad  as 
these  legalistic  and  punctilious  hypocrites  who  deserved  the 
indictment  and  exposure  of  Christ  in  Matt.  23.  Paul  himself 
is  a  specimen  of  the  finer  type  of  Pharisee  which,  however, 
developed  into  the  persecuting  fanatic  till  Jesus  changed  his 
whole  life.  The  power  of  the  Lord  was  with  him  to  heal  (du- 
namis  Kuriou  en  eis  to  iasthai  auton).  So  the  best  texts.  It 
it  neat  Greek,  but  awkward  English:  "Then  was  the  power 
of  the  Lord  for  the  healing  as  to  him  (Jesus)."  Here  Kuriou 
refers  to  Jehovah.  Dunamis  (dynamite)  is  one  of  the  com- 
mon words  for  "miracles"  (dunameis).  What  Luke  means  is 
that  Jesus  had  the  power  of  the  Lord  God  to  heal  with.  He 
does  not  mean  that  this  power  was  intermittent.  He  simply 
calls  attention  to  its  presence  with  Jesus  on  this  occasion. 
18.    That  was  palsied  (hos  en  paralelumenos).    Periphrastic 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  75 

past  perfect  passive  where  Mark  2:3  and  Matt.  9:2  have 
paralutikon  (our  paralytic).  Luke's  phrase  is  the  technical 
medical  term  (Hippocrates,  Galen,  etc.)  rather  than  Mark's 
vernacular  word  (Ramsay,  Luke  the  Physician,  pp.  57f.). 
They  sought  (ezetoun).    Conative  imperfect. 

19.  By  what  way  they  might  bring  him  in  {poias  eis  enegko- 
sin  auton).  Deliberative  subjunctive  of  the  direct  question 
retained  in  the  indirect.  The  housetop  {to  dbma).  Very  old 
word.  The  flat  roof  of  Jewish  houses  was  usually  reached 
by  outside  stairway.  Cf.  Acts  10:9  where  Peter  went  for 
meditation.  Through  the  tiles  {dia  ton  kerambn).  Common 
and  old  word  for  the  tile  roof.  Mark  2:4  speaks  of  digging 
a  hole  in  this  tile  roof.  Let  him  down  (kathekan  auton). 
First  aorist  {k  aorist)  effective  active  of  kathiemi,  common 
verb.  Mark  2:4  has  historical  present  chalosi,  the  verb 
used  by  Jesus  to  Peter  and  in  Peter's  reply  (Luke  5 :4f.)- 
With  his  couch  {sun  tbi  klinidibi).  Also  in  verse  24.  Diminu- 
tive of  kline  (verse  18)  occurring  in  Plutarch  and  Koine 
writers.  Mark  2:4  has  krabatton  (pallet).  It  doubtless  was 
a  pallet  on  which  the  paralytic  lay.  Into  the  midst  before 
Jesus  {eis  to  meson  emprosthen  tou  Iesou).  The  four  friends 
had  succeeded,  probably  each  holding  a  rope  to  a  corner  of 
the  pallet.  It  was  a  moment  of  triumph  over  difficulties 
and  surprise  to  all  in  the  house  (Peter's  apparently,  Mark 
2:1). 

20.  Their  faith  {ten  pistin  auton).  In  all  three  Gospels. 
Man  {anthrope).  Mark  and  Matthew  have  "child"  or 
"Son"  {teknon).  Are  forgiven  {apheontai).  This  Doric 
form  of  the  perfect  passive  indicative  is  for  the  Attic  aph- 
eintai.  It  appears  also  in  Luke  5 123 ;  7:47,  48;  John  20:23  5  I 
John  2:12.  Mark  2:6  and  Matt.  9:2  have  the  present 
passive  aphientai.  Possibly  this  man's  malady  was  due  to 
his  sin  as  is  sometimes  true  (John  5:14).  The  man  had 
faith  along  with  that  of  the  four,  but  he  was  still  a  paralytic 
when  Jesus  forgave  his  sins. 


76        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

21.  But  God  alone  (ei  me  monos  ho  theos).  Mark  has  heis 
(one)  instead  of  monos  (alone). 

22.  Perceiving  (epignous).  Same  form  (second  aorist  ac- 
tive participle  of  epiginosko,  common  verb  for  knowing 
fully)  in  Mark  2:8.  Reason  ye  (dialogizesthe)  as  in  Mark  2:8. 
Matt.  9:4  has  enthumeisthe . 

24.  He  saith  unto  him  that  was  palsied  (eipen  toi  para- 
lelumenoi).  This  same  parenthesis  right  in  the  midst  of 
the  words  of  Jesus  is  in  Mark  2:11  and  Matt.  9:6,  conclusive 
proof  of  interrelation  between  these  documents.  The  words 
of  Jesus  are  quoted  practically  alike  in  all  three  Gospels, 
the  same  purpose  also  hina  eidete  (second  perfect  active 
subjunctive). 

25.  Whereon  he  lay  (epti  ho  katekeito).  Imperfect,  upon 
which  he  had  been  lying  down.  Luke  uses  this  phrase  in- 
stead of  repeating  klinidion  (verse  24).  Glorifying  God 
{doxazbn  ton  theon).    As  one  can  well  imagine. 

26.  Amazement  (ekstasis).  Something  out  of  its  place,  as 
the  mind.  Here  the  people  were  almost  beside  themselves 
as  we  say  with  the  same  idiom.  See  on  Mark  5  42.  So  they 
kept  glorifying  God  (imperfect  tense,  edoxazon)  and  at  the 
same  time  "were  filled  with  fear"  (eplesthesan  phobou, 
aorist  passive).  Strange  things  (paradoxa) .  Our  very  word 
paradox,  contrary  to  (para)  received  opinion  (doxa).  Plato, 
Xenophon,  and  Polybius  use  it.    Here  alone  in  the  N.T. 

27.  A  publican  named  Levi  (telonen  onomati  Leuein). 
Mark  2:13  has  also  "The  son  of  Alphaeus"  while  Matt. 
9:9  calls  him  "Matthew."  He  had,  of  course,  both  names. 
All  three  use  the  same  words  (epi  to  telbnion)  for  the  place 
of  toll.  See  discussion  of  publican  [telones)  on  Matt.  9:9. 
All  three  Gospels  give  the  command  of  Jesus,  Follow  me 
(akolouthei) . 

28.  He  forsook  all  (katalipon  panta).  This  detail  in  Luke 
alone.  He  left  his  profitable  business  for  the  service  of 
Christ.     Followed  him  {ekolouthei  autoi).     Imperfect  active, 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  77 

perhaps  inchoative.  He  began  at  once  to  follow  him  and 
he  kept  it  up.  Both  Mark  2:14  and  Matt.  9:9  have  the 
aorist  {ekolouthesen),  perhaps  ingressive. 

29.  A  great  feast  {dochen  megalen).  Here  and  in  Luke 
14:13  only  in  the  N.T.  The  word  doche,  from  dechomai, 
means  reception.  Occurs  in  Plutarch  and  LXX.  Levi 
made  Jesus  a  big  reception.  Publicans  and  others  {telonon 
kai  allbn).  Luke  declines  here  to  use  "sinners"  like  Mark 
2:15  and  Matt.  9:10  though  he  does  so  in  verse  30  and  in 
15:1.  None  but  social  outcasts  would  eat  with  publicans 
at  such  a  feast  or  barbecue,  for  it  was  a  very  large  affair. 
Were  sitting  at  meat  with  them  {esan  met*  autbn  katakeimenoi). 
Literally,  were  reclining  with  them  (Jesus  and  the  disciples). 
It  was  a  motley  crew  that  Levi  had  brought  together,  but 
he  showed  courage  as  well  as  loyalty  to  Jesus. 

30.  The  Pharisees  and  their  scribes  {hoi  Pharisaioi  kai  hoi 
grammateis  autbn).  Note  article  with  each  substantive  and 
the  order,  not  "scribes  and  Pharisees,"  but  "the  Pharisees 
and  the  scribes  of  them"  (the  Pharisees).  Some  manuscripts 
omit  "their,"  but  Mark  2:16  (the  scribes  of  the  Pharisees) 
shows  that  it  is  correct  here.  Some  of  the  scribes  were  Sad- 
ducees.  It  is  only  the  Pharisees  who  find  fault  here.  Mur- 
mured {ego gguzon).  Imperfect  active.  Picturesque  onomato- 
poetic  word  that  sounds  like  its  meaning.  A  late  word  used 
of  the  cooing  of  doves.  It  is  like  the  buzzing  of  bees,  like 
tonthorruzo  of  literary  Greek.  They  were  not  invited  to  this 
feast  and  would  not  have  come  if  they  had  been.  But,  not 
being  invited,  they  hang  on  the  outside  and  criticize  the 
disciples  of  Jesus  for  being  there.  The  crowd  was  so  large 
that  the  feast  may  have  been  served  out  in  the  open  court 
at  Levi's  house,  a  sort  of  reclining  garden  party.  The  publi- 
cans and  sinners  {ton  telonon  kai  hamartblbn).  Here  Luke  is 
quoting  the  criticism  of  the  critics.  Note  one  article  making 
one  group  of  all  of  them. 

31.  They  that  are  whole  {hoi  hugiainontes).     Old  Greek 


78        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

word  for  good  health  from  hugies,  sound  in  body.  So  also 
in  Luke  7:10;  15:27;  III  John  2.  This  is  the  usual  word  for 
good  health  used  by  Greek  medical  writers.  Mark  2:17  and 
Matt.  9:12  have  hoi  ischuontes  (those  who  have  strength). 

32.  To  repentance  (eis  metanoian).  Alone  in  Luke  not 
genuine  in  Mark  2:17  and  Matt.  9:12.  Only  sinners  would 
need  a  call  to  repentance,  a  change  of  mind  and  life.  For 
the  moment  Jesus  accepts  the  Pharisaic  division  between 
"righteous"  and  "sinners"  to  score  them  and  to  answer 
their  criticism.  At  the  other  times  he  will  show  that  they 
only  pretend  to  be  "righteous"  and  are  "hypocrites"  in 
reality.  But  Jesus  has  here  blazed  the  path  for  all  soul- 
winners.  The  self-satisfied  are  the  hard  ones  to  win  and 
they  often  resent  efforts  to  win  them  to  Christ. 

33.  Often  (pukna).  Only  in  Luke.  Common  word  for 
thick,  compact,  often.  And  make  supplications  (kai  deeseis 
poiountai).  Only  in  Luke.  But  thine  {hoi  de  soi).  Sharp 
contrast  between  the  conduct  of  the  disciples  of  Jesus  and 
those  of  John  and  the  Pharisees  who  here  appear  together 
as  critics  of  Christ  and  his  disciples  (Mark  2:18;  Matt.  9: 
14),  though  Luke  does  not  bring  that  out  sharply.  It  is 
probable  that  Levi  had  his  reception  for  Jesus  on  one  of  the 
Jewish  fast  days  and,  if  so,  this  would  give  special  edge  to 
their  criticism. 

34.  Can  ye  (me  dunasthe).  So  Luke,  adding  make,  poiesai, 
where  Mark  and  Matthew  have  me  dunantai.  All  three 
have  me  and  expect  the  answer  no. 

35.  Then  in  those  days  (tote  en  ekeinais  tais  hemerais). 
Here  Mark  2:20  has  "then  in  that  day,"  and  Matt.  9:15 
only  "then." 

36.  Also  a  parable  (kai  parabolen).  There  are  three  para- 
bles here  in  the  answer  of  Jesus  (the  bridegroom,  the  patch 
on  the  garment,  the  wineskin).  They  are  not  called  parables 
save  here,  but  they  are  parables  and  Luke's  language  means 
that.     Rendeth   (schisas).     This  in  Luke  alone.     Common. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  79 

verb.  Used  of  splitting  rocks  (Matt.  27:51).  Our  word 
schism  comes  from  it.  Putteth  it  (epiballei).  So  Matt.  9:16 
when  Mark  2:21  has  epiraptei  (sews  on).  The  word  for 
"piece"  or  "patch"  (epiblema)  in  all  the  three  Gospels  is 
from  the  verb  epiballo,  to  clap  on,  and  is  in  Plutarch,  Arrian, 
LXX,  though  the  verb  is  as  old  as  Homer.  See  on  Matthew 
and  Mark  for  distinction  between  kainos  (fresh),  neos  (new), 
and  palaios  (old).  He  will  rend  the  new  (kai  to  kainon  schisei). 
Future  active  indicative.  So  the  best  MSS.  Will  not  agree 
(ou  sumphonesei).  Future  active  indicative.  So  the  best 
manuscripts  again.  With  the  old  (toi  palaioi).  Associative 
instrumental  case.  Instead  of  this  phrase  in  Luke,  Mark 
2:21  and  Matt.  9:16  have  "a  worse  rent"  (cheiron  schisma). 

38.  Must  be  put  (bleteon).  This  verbal  adjective  in  -teos 
rather  than  -tos  appears  here  alone  in  the  N.T.  though  it  is 
common  enough  in  Attic  Greek.  It  is  a  survival  of  the 
literary  style.  This  is  the  impersonal  use  and  is  transitive 
in  sense  here  and  governs  the  accusative  "new  wine"  (oinon 
neon),  though  the  agent  is  not  expressed  (Robertson,  Gram- 
mar, p.  1097). 

39.  The  old  is  good  (Ho  palaios  chrestos  estin).  So  the  best 
MSS.  rather  that  chrestoteros,  comparative  (better).  West- 
cott  and  Hoit  wrongly  bracket  the  whole  verse,  though 
occurring  in  Aleph,  B  C  L  and  most  of  the  old  documents. 
It  is  absent  in  D  and  some  of  the  old  Latin  MSS.  It  is  the 
philosophy  of  the  obscurantist,  that  is  here  pictured  by 
Christ.  "The  prejudiced  person  will  not  even  try  the  new, 
or  admit  that  it  has  any  merits.  He  knows  that  the  old  is 
pleasant,  and  suits  him;  and  that  is  enough;  he  is  not  going 
to  change"  (Plummer).  This  is  Christ's  picture  of  the 
reactionary  Pharisees. 


CHAPTER  VI 

I.  On  a  sabbath  (en  sabbatbi).  This  is  the  second  sabbath 
on  which  Jesus  is  noted  by  Luke.  The  first  was  Luke  4:31- 
41.  There  was  another  in  John  5:1-47.  There  is  Western 
and  Syrian  (Byzantine)  evidence  for  a  very  curious  reading 
here  which  calls  this  sabbath  "secondfirst"  (deuteroprotoi) . 
It  is  undoubtedly  spurious,  though  Westcott  and  Hort  print 
it  in  the  margin.  A  possible  explanation  is  that  a  scribe 
wrote  "first"  (protoi)  on  the  margin  because  of  the  sabbath 
miracle  in  Luke  6:6-11.  Then  another  scribe  recalled  Luke 
4:31  where  a  sabbath  is  mentioned  and  wrote  "second" 
(deuterbi)  also  on  the  margin.  Finally  a  third  scribe  com- 
bined the  two  in  the  word  deuteroprotoi  that  is  not  found 
elsewhere.  If  it  were  genuine,  we  should  not  know  what  it 
means.  Plucked  (etillon).  Imperfect  active.  They  were 
plucking  as  they  went  on  through  (diaporeuesthai).  Whether 
wheat  or  barley,  we  do  not  know,  not  our  "corn"  (maize). 
Did  eat  (esthion).  Imperfect  again.  See  on  Matt.  I2:if. 
and  Mark  2:23^  for  the  separate  acts  in  supposed  violence 
of  the  sabbath  laws.  Rubbing  them  in  their  hands  (psochontes 
tais  chersin).  Only  in  Luke  and  only  here  in  the  N.T.  This 
was  one  of  the  chief  offences.  "According  to  Rabbinical 
notions,  it  was  reaping,  threshing,  winnowing,  and  prepar- 
ing food  all  at  once"  (Plummer).  These  Pharisees  were 
straining  out  gnats  and  swallowing  camels!  This  verb 
psbchb  is  a  late  one  for  psao,  to  rub. 

3.  Not  even  this  (oude  touto).  This  small  point  only  in 
Luke.  What  (ho).  Literally,  which.  Mark  2:25  and  Matt. 
12:3  have  ti  (what). 

4.  Did  take  (labon).  Second  aorist  active  participle  of 
lambano.     Not  in  Mark  and  Matthew.     See  Matt.  12:1-8 

80 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  8 1 

and  Mark  2:23-28  for  discussion  of  details  about  the  shew- 
bread  and  the  five  arguments  in  defence  of  his  conduct  on 
the  sabbath  (example  of  David,  work  of  the  priests  on  the 
sabbath,  prophecy  of  Hosea  6:6,  purpose  of  the  sabbath  for 
man,  the  Son  of  Man  lord  of  the  sabbath).  It  was  an  over- 
whelming and  crushing  reply  to  these  pettifogging  ceremo- 
nialists  to  which  they  could  not  reply,  but  which  increased 
their  anger.  Codex  D  transfers  verse  5  to  after  verse  10 
and  puts  here  the  following:  "On  the  same  day  beholding 
one  working  on  the  sabbath  he  said  to  him:  Man,  if  you 
know  what  you  are  doing,  happy  are  you;  but  if  you  do  not 
know,  cursed  are  you  and  a  transgressor  of  the  law." 

6.  On  another  sabbath  {en  heteroi  sabbatoi).  This  was 
a  second  (heteron,  as  it  often  means),  but  not  necessarily 
the  next,  sabbath.  This  incident  is  given  by  all  three  synop- 
tics (Mark  3:1-6;  Matt.  12:9-14;  Luke  6:6-11).  See  Matt, 
and  Mark  for  details.  Only  Luke  notes  that  it  was  on  a 
sabbath.  Was  this  because  Luke  as  a  physician  had  to 
meet  this  problem  in  his  own  practise?  Right  hand  (he 
dexia).  This  alone  in  Luke,  the  physician's  eye  for  particu- 
lars. 

7.  The  scribes  and  the  Pharisees  (hoi  grammateis  kai  hoi 
Pharisaioi).  Only  Luke  here  though  Pharisees  named  in 
Matt.  12:14  and  Pharisees  and  Herodians  in  Mark  3:6. 
Watched  him  (pareterounto  auton).  Imperfect  middle,  were 
watching  for  themselves  on  the  side  (para).  Mark  3:2  has 
the  imperfect  active  pareteroun.  Common  verb,  but  the 
proposition  para  gave  an  extra  touch,  watching  either 
assiduously  like  the  physician  at  the  bedside  or  insidiously 
with  evil  intent  as  here.  Would  heal  (therapeusei).  But  the 
present  active  indicative  (therapeuei)  may  be  the  correct 
text  here.  So  Westcott  and  Hort.  That  they  might  find  out 
how  to  accuse  him  (hina  heurosin  kategorein  autou).  Second 
aorist  active  subjunctive  of  heurisko  and- the  infinitive  with  it 
means  to  find  out  how  to  do  a  thing.    They  were  determined 


82        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

to  make  a  case  against  Jesus.  They  felt  sure  that  their 
presence  would  prevent  any  spurious  work  on  the  part  of 
Jesus. 

8.  But  he  knew  their  thoughts  (autos  de  eidei  tous  dialogis- 
mous  autbn).  In  Luke  alone.  Imperfect  in  sense,  second 
past  perfect  in  form  eidei  from  oida.  Jesus,  in  contrast  to 
these  spies  (Plummer),  read  their  intellectual  processes  like 
an  open  book.  His  hand  withered  {peer an  ten  cheira).  Predi- 
cate position  of  the  adjective.  So  in  Mark  3 :3.  Stand  forth 
{stethi).  Luke  alone  has  this  verb,  second  aorist  active 
imperative.  Mark  3 :3  has  Arise  into  the  midst  {egeire  eis 
to  meson).  Luke  has  Arise  and  step  forth  into  the  midst 
{egeire  kai  stethi  eis  to  meson).  Christ  worked  right  out 
in  the  open  where  all  could  see.  It  was  a  moment  of  ex- 
citement when  the  man  stepped  forth  {este)  there  before 
them  all. 

9.  I  ask  you  {eperoto  humas).  They  had  questions  in  their 
hearts  about  Jesus.  He  now  asks  in  addition  {ep9)  an  open 
question  that  brings  the  whole  issue  into  the  open.  A  life 
{psuchen).  So  the  Revised  Version.  The  rabbis  had  a  rule: 
Periculum  vitae  pellit  sabbatum.  But  it  had  to  be  a  Jew  whose 
life  was  in  peril  on  the  sabbath.  The  words  of  Jesus  cut  to 
the  quick.  Or  to  destroy  it  {e  apolesai).  On  this  very  day 
these  Pharisees  were  plotting  to  destroy  Jesus   (verse  7). 

10.  He  looked  round  about  on  them  all  {periblepsamenos). 
First  aorist  middle  participle  as  in  Mark  3 :5,  the  middle 
voice  giving  a  personal  touch  to  it  all.  Mark  adds  "with 
anger"  which  Luke  here  does  not  put  in.  All  three  Gospels 
have  the  identical  command:  Stretch  forth  thy  hand  {ex- 
teinon  ten  cheira  sou).  First  aorist  active  imperative. 
Stretch  out,  clean  out,  full  length.  All  three  Gospels  also 
have  the  first  aorist  passive  indicative  apekatestathe  with  the 
double  augment  of  the  double  compound  verb  apokathistemi. 
As  in  Greek  writers,  so  here  the  double  compound  means 
complete  restoration  to  the  former  state. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  83 

11.  They  were  filled  with  madness  {eplesthesan  anoias) 
First  aorist  passive  (effective)  with  genitive:  In  5:26  we  saw 
the  people  filled  with  fear.  Here  is  rage  that  is  kin  to  insanity, 
for  anoias  is  lack  of  sense  {a  privative  and  nous,  mind).  An 
old  word,  but  only  here  and  II  Tim.  3  :o,  in  the  N.T.  Communed 
(dielaloun),  imperfect  active,  picturing  their  excited  counsel- 
lings  with  one  another.  Mark  3  :6  notes  that  they  bolted  out 
of  the  synagogue  and  outside  plotted  even  with  the  Herodians 
how  to  destroy  Jesus,  strange  co-conspirators  these  against 
the  common  enemy.  What  they  might  do  to  Jesus  {ti  an 
poiesaien  Iesou).  Luke  puts  it  in  a  less  damaging  way  than 
Mark  3:6  and  Matt.  12:14.  This  aorist  optative  with  an 
is  the  deliberative  question  like  that  in  Acts  17:18  retained 
in  the  indirect  form  here.  Perhaps  Luke  means,  not  that 
they  were  undecided  about  killing  Jesus,  but  only  as  to  the 
best  way  of  doing  it.  Already  nearly  two  years  before  the 
end  we  see  the  set  determination  to  destroy  Jesus.  We  see 
it  here  in  Galilee.  We  have  already  seen  it  at  the  feast  in 
Jerusalem  (John  5:18)  where  "the  Jews  sought  the  more  to 
kill  him."  John  and  the  Synoptics  are  in  perfect  agreement 
as  to  the  Pharisaic  attitude  toward  Jesus. 

12.  He  went  out  into  the  mountains  to  pray  {exelthein  auton 
eis  to  or os  proseuxasthai).  Note  ex-  where  Mark  3:13  has 
goeth  up  (anabainei).  Luke  alone  has  "to  pray"  as  he 
so  often  notes  the  habit  of  prayer  in  Jesus.  He  continued  all 
night  {en  dianuktereuon).  Periphrastic  imperfect  active. 
Here  alone  in  the  N.T.,  but  common  in  the  LXX  and  in  late 
Greek  writers.  Medical  writers  used  it  of  whole  night  vigils. 
In  prayer  to  God  {en  tei  proseuchei  tou  theou).  Objective 
genitive  tou  theou.  This  phrase  occurs  nowhere  else.  Pros- 
euche  does  not  mean  "place  of  prayer"  or  synagogue  as  in 
Acts  16:13,  but  the  actual  prayer  of  Jesus  to  the  Father  all 
night  long.  He  needed  the  Father's  guidance  now  in  the 
choice  of  the  Apostles  in  the  morning. 

13.  When  it  was  day  {hote  egeneto  hemera).     When  day 


84        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

came,  after  the  long  night  of  prayer.  He  chose  from  them 
twelve  (eklexamenos  ap'  autbn  dodeka).  The  same  root 
{leg)  was  used  for  picking  out,  selecting  and  then  for  saying. 
There  was  a  large  group  of  " disciples"  or  "learners"  whom 
he  "called"  to  him  (prosephbnesen) ,  and  from  among  whom 
he  chose  (of  himself,  and  for  himself,  indirect  middle  voice 
(eklexamenos).  It  was  a  crisis  in  the  work  of  Christ.  Jesus 
assumed  full  responsibility  even  for  the  choice  of  Judas  who 
was  not  forced  upon  Jesus  by  the  rest  of  the  Twelve.  "You 
did  not  choose  me,  but  I  chose  you,"  (John  15:16)  where 
Jesus  uses  exelexasthe  and  exelexamen  as  here  by  Luke. 
Whom  also  he  named  apostles  (hous  kai  apostolous  bnomasen). 
So  then  Jesus  gave  the  twelve  chosen  disciples  this  appellation. 
Aleph  and  B  have  these  same  words  in  Mark  3:14  besides  the 
support  of  a  few  of  the  best  cursives,  the  Bohairic  Coptic 
Version  and  the  Greek  margin  of  the  Harclean  Syriac.  West- 
cott  and  Hort  print  them  in  their  text  in  Mark  3:14,  but  it 
remains  doubtful  whether  they  were  not  brought  into  Mark 
from  Luke  6:13  where  they  are  undoubtedly  genuine.  See 
Matt.  10:2  where  the  connection  with  sending  them  out  by 
twos  in  the  third  tour  of  Galilee.  The  word  is  derived  from 
apostello,  to  send  (Latin,  mitto)  and  apostle  is  missionary, 
one  sent.  Jesus  applies  the  term  to  himself  (apesteilas,  John 
17:3)  as  does  Heb.  3:1.  The  word  is  applied  to  others, 
like  Barnabas,  besides  these  twelve  including  the  Apostle 
Paul  who  is  on  a  par  with  them  in  rank  and  authority,  and 
even  to  mere  messengers  of  the  churches  (II  Cor.  8:23).  But 
these  twelve  apostles  stand  apart  from  all  others  in  that  they 
were  all  chosen  at  once  by  Jesus  himself  "that  they  might  be 
with  him  "  (Mark  3  114),  to  be  trained  by  Jesus  himself  and  to 
interpret  him  and  his  message  to  the  world.  In  the  nature 
of  the  case  they  could  have  no  successors  as  they  had  to  be 
personal  witnesses  to  the  life  and  resurrection  of  Jesus  (Acts 
1:22).  The  selection  of  Matthias  to  succeed  Judas  cannot 
be  called  a  mistake,  but  it  automatically  ceased.     For  dis- 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  85 

cussion  of  the  names  and  groups  in  the  list  see  discussion  on 
Matt.  10:1-4  and  Mark  3  :I4~I9. 

16.  Which  was  the  traitor  (hos  egeneto  prodotes).  Who 
became  traitor,  more  exactly,  egeneto,  not  en.  He  gave  no 
signs  of  treachery  when  chosen. 

17.  He  came  down  with  them  (katabas  me?  auibn).  Second 
aorist  active  participle  of  katabaino,  common  verb.  This 
was  the  night  of  prayer  up  in  the  mountain  (Mark  3 1  13 ;  Luke 
6:12)  and  the  choice  of  the  Twelve  next  morning.  The  going 
up  into  the  mountain  of  Matt.  5  :i  may  simply  be  a  summary 
statement  with  no  mention  of  what  Luke  has  explained  or 
may  be  a  reference  to  the  elevation,  where  he  "sat  down" 
(Matt.  5:1),  above  the  plain  or  "level  place"  (epi  topou 
pedinou)  on  the  mountain  side  where  Jesus  "stood"  or 
"stopped"  (este).  It  may  be  a  level  place  towards  the  foot 
of  the  mountain.  He  stopped  his  descent  at  this  level  place 
and  then  found  a  slight  elevation  on  the  mountain  side  and 
began  to  speak.  There  is  not  the  slightest  reason  for  making 
Matthew  locate  this  sermon  on  the  mountain  and  Luke  in  the 
valley  as  if  the  places,  audiences,  and  topics  were  different. 
For  the  unity  of  the  sermon  see  discussion  on  Matt.  5  :if. 
The  reports  in  Matthew  and  Luke  begin  alike,  cover  the  same 
general  ground  and  end  alike.  The  report  in  Matthew  is 
longer  chiefly  because  in  Chapter  5,  he  gives  the  argument 
showing  the  contrast  between  Christ's  conception  of  right- 
eousness and  that  of  the  Jewish  rabbis.  Undoubtedly,  Jesus 
repeated  many  of  the  crisp  sayings  here  at  other  times  as  in 
Luke  12,  but  it  is  quite  gratuitous  to  argue  that  Matthew 
and  Luke  have  made  up  this  sermon  out  of  isolated  sayings 
of  Christ  at  various  times.  Both  Matthew  and  Luke  give 
too  much  that  is  local  of  place  and  audience  for  that  idea. 
Matt.  5:1  speaks  of  "the  multitudes"  and  "his  disciples." 
Luke  6:17  notes  "a  great  multitude  of  his  disciples,  and  a 
great  number  of  the  people  from  all  Judea  and  Jerusalem, 
and  the  sea  coast  of  Tyre  and  Sidon."    They  agree  in  the 


86        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

presence  of  disciples  and  crowds  besides  the  disciples  from 
whom  the  twelve  apostles  were  chosen.  It  is  important  to 
note  how  already  people  were  coming  from  "  the  sea  coast 
of  Tyre  and  Sidon"  "to  hear  him  and  to  be  healed  (iathenai, 
first  aorist  passive  of  iaomai)  of  their  diseases." 

1 8.  With  unclean  spirits  (apo  pneumaton  akatharton) .  In  an 
amphibolous  position  for  it  can  be  construed  with  "  troubled," 

(present  passive  participle  enochloumenoi)  or  with  "were 
healed"  (imperfect  passive,  ether apeuonto).  The  healings 
were  repeated  as  often  as  they  came.  Note  here  both  verbs, 
iaomai  and  therapeuo,  used  of  the  miraculous  cures  of  Jesus. 
Therapeud  is  the  verb  more  commonly  employed  of  regular 
professional  cures,  but  no  such  distinction  is  made  here. 

19.  Sought  to  touch  him  (ezetoun  haptesthai  autou).  Im- 
perfect active.  One  can  see  the  surging,  eager  crowd  pressing 
up  to  Jesus.  Probably  some  of  them  felt  that  there  was  a 
sort  of  virtue  or  magic  in  touching  his  garments  like  the 
poor  woman  in  Luke  8:431.  (Mark  5:23  =  Matt.  9:21).  For 
power  came  forth  from  him  (hoti  dunamis  par'  autou  exercheto). 
Imperfect  middle,  power  was  coming  out  from  him.  This 
is  the  reason  for  the  continual  approach  to  Jesus.  And 
healed  them  all  {kai  iato  pantas).  Imperfect  middle  again. 
Was  healing  all,  kept  on  healing  all.  The  preacher  today 
who  is  not  a  vehicle  of  power  from  Christ  to  men  may 
well  question  why  that  is  true.  Undoubtedly  the  failure  to 
get  a  blessing  is  one  reason  why  many  people  stop  going  to 
church.  One  may  turn  to  Paul's  tremendous  words  in  Phil. 
4:13:  "I  have  strength  for  all  things  in  him  who  keeps  on 
pouring  power  into  me"  (panta  ischub  en  toi  endunamounti 
me).  It  was  at  a  time  of  surpassing  dynamic  spiritual  energy 
when  Jesus  delivered  this  greatest  of  all  sermons  so  far  as 
they  are  reported  to  us.  The  very  air  was  electric  with 
spiritual  power.  There  are  such  times  as  all  preachers 
know. 

20.  And  he  lifted  up  his  eyes  {kai  autos  eparas  tous  opthal- 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  87 

mous  autou).  First  aorist  active  participle  from  epairb. 
Note  also  Luke's  favourite  use  of  kai  autos  in  beginning  a 
paragraph.  Vivid  detail  alone  in  Luke.  Jesus  looked  the 
vast  audience  full  in  the  face.  Matt.  5:2  mentions  that 
"he  opened  his  mouth  and  taught  them"  (began  to  teach 
them,  inchoative  imperfect,  edidasken) .  He  spoke  out  so  that 
the  great  crowd  could  hear.  Some  preachers  do  not  open 
their  mouths  and  do  not  look  up  at  the  people,  but  down  at 
the  manuscript  and  drawl  along  while  the  people  lose  interest 
and  even  go  to  sleep  or  slip  out.  Ye  poor  {hoi  ptochoi).  The 
poor,  but  "yours"  (humetera)  justifies  the  translation  "ye." 
Luke's  report  is  direct  address  in  all  the  four  beatitudes  and 
four  woes  given  by  him.  It  is  useless  to  speculate  why  Luke 
gives  only  four  of  the  eight  beatitudes  in  Matthew  or  why 
Matthew  does  not  give  the  four  woes  in  Luke.  One  can 
only  say  that  neither  professes  to  give  a  complete  report  of 
the  sermon.  There  is  no  evidence  to  show  that  either  saw  the 
report  of  the  other.  They  may  have  used  a  common  source 
like  Q  (the  Logia  of  Jesus)  or  they  may  have  had  separate 
sources.  Luke's  first  beatitude  corresponds  with  Matthew's 
first,  but  he  does  not  have  "in  spirit"  after  "poor."  Does 
Luke  represent  Jesus  as  saying  that  poverty  itself  is  a  bless- 
ing? It  can  be  made  so.  Or  does  Luke  represent  Jesus  as 
meaning  what  is  in  Matthew,  poverty  of  spirit?  The  king- 
dom of  God  {he  basileia  tou  theou).  Matt.  5:3  has  "the 
kingdom  of  heaven"  which  occurs  alone  in  Matthew  though 
he  also  has  the  one  here  in  Luke  with  no  practical  difference. 
The  rabbis  usually  said  "the  kingdom  of  heaven."  They 
used  it  of  the  political  Messianic  kingdom  when  Judaism  of 
the  Pharisaic  sort  would  triumph  over  the  world.  The  idea 
of  Jesus  is  in  the  sharpest  contrast  to  that  conception  here 
and  always.  See  on  Matt.  3 :2  for  discussion  of  the  meaning 
of  the  word  "kingdom."  It  is  the  favourite  word  of  Jesus 
for  the  rule  of  God  in  the  heart  here  and  now.  It  is  both 
present  and  future  and  will  reach  a  glorious  consummation* 


88        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Some  of  the  sayings  of  Christ  have  apocalyptic  and  eschato- 
logical  figures,  but  the  heart  of  the  matter  is  here  in  the 
spiritual  reality  of  the  reign  of  God  in  the  hearts  of  those 
who  serve  him.  The  kingdom  parables  expand  and  enlarge 
upon  various  phases  of  this  inward  life  and  growth. 

21.  Now  {nun).  Luke  adds  this  adverb  here  and  in  the 
next  sentence  after  "weep."  This  sharpens  the  contrast 
between  present  sufferings  and  the  future  blessings.  Filled 
(chortasthesesthe).  Future  passive  indicative.  The  same 
verb  in  Matt.  5 :6.  Originally  it  was  used  for  giving  fodder 
(chortos)  to  animals,  but  here  it  is  spiritual  fodder  or  food 
except  in  Luke  15:16  and  16:21.  Luke  here  omits  "and 
thirst  after  righteousness."  Weep  {klaiontes).  Audible 
weeping.  Where  Matt.  5:4  has  "mourn"  (penthountes). 
Shall  laugh  (gelasete).  Here  Matt.  5:4  has  "shall  be  com- 
forted."   Luke's  words  are  terse. 

22.  When  they  shall  separate  you  (hotan  aphorisosin  humas). 
First  aorist  active  subjunctive,  from  aphorizo,  common  verb 
for  marking  off  a  boundary.  So  either  in  good  sense  or  bad 
sense  as  here.  The  reference  is  to  excommunication  from 
the  congregation  as  well  as  from  social  intercourse.  Cast 
out  your  name  as  evil  {exbalbsin  to  onoma  humon  hbs  poneron). 
Second  aorist  active  subjunctive  of  ekballo,  common  verb. 
The  verb  is  used  in  Aristophanes,  Sophocles,  and  Plato  of 
hissing  an  actor  off  the  stage.  The  name  of  Christian  or 
disciple  or  Nazarene  came  to  be  a  byword  of  contempt 
as  shown  in  the  Acts.  It  was  even  unlawful  in  the  Neronian 
persecution  when  Christianity  was  not  a  religio  licita.  For 
the  Son  of  man's  sake  (heneka  tou  huiou  tou  anthrbpou). 
Jesus  foretold  what  will  befall  those  who  are  loyal  to  him. 
The  Acts  of  the  Apostles  is  a  commentary  on  this  prophecy. 
This  is  Christ's  common  designation  of  himself,  never  of 
others  save  by  Stephen  (Acts  7:56)  and  in  the  Apocalypse 
(Rev.  1:13;  14:14).  But  both  Son  of  God  and  Son  of  man 
apply  to  him  (John  1:50,  52;  Matt.  26:63^).    Christ  was  a 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  89 

real  man  though  the  Son  of  God.    He  is  also  the  representa- 
tive man  and  has  authority  over  all  men. 

23.  Leap  for  joy  (skirtesate).  Old  verb  and  in  LXX,  but 
only  in  Luke  in  the  N.T.  (here  and  1 141,  44).  It  answers  to 
Matthew's  (5:12)  "be  exceeding  glad."  Did  (epoioun). 
Imperfect  active,  the  habit  of  "their  fathers"  (peculiar  to 
both  here).  Matt.  5:12  has  "persecuted."  Thus  they  will 
receive  a  prophet's  reward  (Matt.  1:41). 

24.  But  woe  unto  you  that  are  rich  (Plen  ouai  humin  tois 
plousiois).  Sharp  contrast  {plen).  As  a  matter  of  fact  the 
rich  Pharisees  and  Sadducees  were  the  chief  opposers  of 
Christ  as  of  the  early  disciples  later  (James  5:1-6).  Ye  have 
received  (apechete).  Receipt  in  full  apecho  means  as  the 
papyri  show.  Consolation  (paraklesin).  From  parakaleof 
to  call  to  one's  side,  to  encourage,  to  help,  to  cheer. 

25.  Now  (nun).  Here  twice  as  in  verse  21  in  contrast  with 
future  punishment.  The  joys  and  sorrows  in  these  two 
verses  are  turned  round,  measure  for  measure  reversed. 
The  Rich  Man  and  Lazarus  (Luke  16:19-31)  illustrate  these 
contrasts  in  the  present  and  the  future. 

26.  In  the  same  manner  did  their  fathers  (ta  auta  epoioun 
hoi  pater es  auton).  Literally,  their  fathers  did  the  same 
things  to  the  false  prophets.  That  is  they  spoke  well  (kalos), 
finely  of  false  prophets.  Praise  is  sweet  to  the  preacher  but 
all  sorts  of  preachers  get  it.  Of  you  (humas).  Accusative 
case  after  words  of  speaking  according  to  regular  Greek 
idiom,  to  speak  one  fair,  to  speak  well  of  one. 

27.  But  I  say  unto  you  that  hear  (Alia  humin  lego  tois 
akouousin).  There  is  a  contrast  in  this  use  of  alia  like  that 
in  Matt.  5:44.  This  is  the  only  one  of  the  many  examples 
given  by  Matthew  in  Chapter  5  of  the  sharp  antithesis  be- 
tween what  the  rabbis  taught  and  what  Jesus  said.  Perhaps 
that  contrast  is  referred  to  by  Luke.  If  necessary,  alia 
could  be  co-ordinating  or  paratactic  conjunction  as  in  II  Cor. 
7:11  rather  than  adversative  as  apparently  here.    See  Matt, 


90        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

5 :43f.     Love  of  enemies  is  in  the  O.T.,  but  Jesus  ennobles 
the  word,  agapab,  and  uses  it  of  love  for  one's  enemies. 

28.  That  despitefully  use  you  (ton  epereazontbn  humds). 
This  old  verb  occurs  here  only  in  the  N.T.  and  in  I  Pet.  3  :i6, 
not  being  genuine  in  Matt.  5:44. 

29.  On  the  cheek  (epi  ten  siagona).  Matt.  5 :39  has  "right." 
Old  word  meaning  jaw  or  jawbone,  but  in  the  N.T.  only 
here  and  Matt.  5 139,  which  see  for  discussion.  It  seems  an 
act  of  violence  rather  than  contempt.  Sticklers  for  extreme 
literalism  find  trouble  with  the  conduct  of  Jesus  in  John 
i8:22f.  where  Jesus,  on  receiving  a  slap  in  the  face,  protested 
against  it.  Thy  cloke  (to  himation),  thy  coat  (ton  chitbna). 
Here  the  upper  and  more  valuable  garment  (himation)  is 
first  taken,  the  under  and  less  valuable  chiton  last.  In  A^att. 
5  40  the  process  (apparently  a  legal  one)  is  reversed.  With- 
hold not  (me  kbluseis).  Aorist  subjunctive  in  prohibition 
against  committing  an  act.  Do  not  hinder  him  in  his  rob- 
bing. It  is  usually  useless  anyhow  with  modern  armed 
bandits. 

30.  Ask  them  not  again  (me  apaitei).  Here  the  present 
active  imperative  in  a  prohibition,  do  not  have  the  habit  of 
asking  back.  This  common  verb  only  here  in  the  N.T.,  for 
aitousin  is  the  correct  text  in  Luke  12:20.  The  literary  flavour 
of  Luke's  Koine  style  is  seen  in  his  frequent  use  of  words 
common  in  the  literary  Greek,  but  appearing  nowhere  else 
in  the  N.T. 

31.  As  ye  would  (kathbs  thelete).  In  Matt.  7:12  the  Golden 
Rule  begins:  Panta  hosa  ean  thelete.  Luke  has  "likewise" 
(homoibs)  where  Matthew  has  houibs.  See  on  Matthew  for 
discussion  of  the  saying. 

32.  What  thank  have  ye?  (poia  humin  charts  estin;).  What 
grace  or  gratitude  is  there  to  you?  Matt.  5:46  has  misthon 
(reward). 

33.  Do  good  (agathopoiete) .  Third-class  condition,  ean 
and  present  subjunctive.    This  verb  not  in  old  Greek,  but 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  9 1 

in  LXX.  Even  sinners  (kai  hoi  hamartbloi).  Even  the  sin- 
ners, the  article  distinguishing  the  class.  Matt.  5:46  has 
"even  the  publicans"  and  5:47  "even  the  Gentiles."  That 
completes  the  list  of  the  outcasts  for  "sinners"  includes 
"harlots"  and  all  the  rest. 

34.  If  ye  lend  (ean  danisete).  Third-class  condition,  first 
aorist  active  subjunctive  from  danizo  (old  form  daneizo) 
to  lend  for  interest  in  a  business  transaction  (here  in  active 
to  lend  and  Matt.  5:42  middle  to  borrow  and  nowhere  else 
in  N.T.),  whereas  kichremi  (only  Luke  11 15  in  N.T.)  means 
to  loan  as  a  friendly  act.  To  receive  again  as  much  (hina 
apolabosin  ta  isd).  Second  aorist  active  subjunctive  of 
apolambano,  old  verb,  to  get  back  in  full  like  apecho  in  6:24. 
Literally  here,  "that  they  may  get  back  the  equal"  (prin- 
cipal and  interest,  apparently).  It  could  mean  "equivalent 
services."    No  parallel  in  Matthew. 

35.  But  (plen).  Plain  adversative  like  plen  in  verse  24. 
Never  despairing  {meden  apelpizontes).  Meden  is  read  by 
A  B  L  Bohairic  and  is  the  reading  of  Westcott  and  Hort. 
The  reading  medena  is  translated  "despairing  of  no  man." 
The  Authorized  Version  has  it  "hoping  for  nothing  again," 
a  meaning  for  apelpizo  with  no  parallel  elsewhere.  Field 
(Otium  Nor.  iii.  40)  insists  that  all  the  same  the  context  de- 
mands this  meaning  because  of  apelpizein  in  verse  34,  but 
the  correct  reading  there  is  elpizein,  not  apelpizein.  Here 
Field's  argument  falls  to  the  ground.  The  word  occurs  in 
Polybius,  Diodorus,  LXX  with  the  sense  of  despairing  and 
that  is  the  meaning  here.  D  and  Old  Latin  documents  have 
nihil  desperantes,  but  the  Vulgate  has  nihil  inde  sperantej 
(hoping  for  nothing  thence)  and  this  false  rendering  has 
wrought  great  havoc  in  Europe.  "On  the  strength  of  it 
Popes  and  councils  have  repeatedly  condemned  the  taking 
of  any  interest  whatever  for  loans.  As  loans  could  not  be 
had  without  interest,  and  Christians  were  forbidden  to  take 
it,  money  lending  passed  into  the  hands  of  the  Jews,  and 


92        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

added  greatly  to  the  unnatural  detestation  in  which  Jews 
were  held"  (Plummer).  By  "never  despairing"  or  "giving 
up  nothing  in  despair"  Jesus  means  that  we  are  not  to  despair 
about  getting  the  money  back.  We  are  to  help  the  appar- 
ently hopeless  cases.  Medical  writers  use  the  word  for  des- 
perate or  hopeless  cases.  Sons  of  the  Most  High  (huoi  Hup- 
sistou).  In  1:32  Jesus  is  called  "Son  of  the  Highest"  and 
here  all  real  children  or  sons  of  God  (Luke  20:36)  are  so 
termed.  See  also  1:35,  76  for  the  use  of  "the  Highest"  of 
God.  He  means  the  same  thing  that  we  see  in  Matt.  5  45,  48 
by  "your  Father."  Toward  the  unthankful  and  evil  (epi 
tous  acharistous  kai  ponerous).  God  the  Father  is  kind  to- 
wards the  unkind  and  wicked.  Note  the  one  article  with 
both  adjectives. 

36.  Even  as  your  Father  (kathos  ho  pater  humon).  In  Matt. 
5:48  we  have  hos  ho  pater  humon.  In  both  the  perfection  of 
the  Father  is  placed  as  the  goal  before  his  children.  In 
neither  case  is  it  said  that  they  have  reached  it. 

37.  And  judge  not  (kai  me  krinete).  Me  and  the  present 
active  imperative,  forbidding  the  habit  of  criticism.  The 
common  verb  krino,  to  separate,  we  have  in  our  English  words 
critic,  criticism,  criticize,  dis-criminate.  Jesus  does  not 
mean  that  we  are  not  to  form  opinions,  but  not  to  form  them 
rashly,  unfairly,  like  our  prejudice.  Ye  shall  not  be  judged 
(ou  me  krithete).  First  aorist  passive  subjunctive  with 
double  negative  ou  me,  strong  negative.  Condemn  not 
{me  katadikazete).  To  give  judgment  (dike,  dixazo)  against 
(kata)  one.  Me  and  present  imperative.  Either  cease  doing 
or  do  not  have  the  habit  of  doing  it.  Old  verb.  Ye  shall  not 
be  condemned  (ou  me  katadikasthete).  First  aorist  passive  in- 
dicative again  with  the  double  negative.  Censoriousness  is 
a  bad  habit.  Release  (apoluete).  Positive  command  the 
opposite  of  the  censoriousness  condemned. 

38.  Pressed  down  (pepiesmenon).  Perfect  passive  par- 
ticiple from  piezo,  old  verb,  but  here  alone  in  the  N.T., 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  93 

though  the  Doric  form  piazo,  to  seize,  occurs  several  times 
(John  7:30,  32,  44).  Shaken  together  (sesaleumenon).  Perfect 
passive  participle  again  from  common  verb  saleub.  Running 
over  (huperekchunnomenon).  Present  middle  participle  of 
this  double  compound  verb  not  found  elsewhere  save  in  A  Q 
in  Joel  2 124.  Chuno  is  a  late  form  of  cheb.  There  is  asynde- 
ton here,  no  conjunction  connecting  these  participles.  The 
present  here  is  in  contrast  to  the  two  preceding  perfects. 
The  participles  form  an  epexegesis  or  explanation  of  the 
"good  measure"  {metron  kalon).  Into  your  bosom  (eis  ton 
kolpon  humbn).  The  fold  of  the  wide  upper  garment  bound 
by  the  girdle  made  a  pocket  in  common  use  (Ex.  4:6;  Prov. 
6:27;  Psa.  79:12;  Isa.  65 :6f . ;  Jer.  32:18).  So  Isa.  65:7: 1  will 
measure  their  former  work  unto  their  bosom.  Shall  be  meas- 
ured to  you  again  (antimetrethesetai) .  Future  passive  indica- 
tive of  the  verb  here  only  in  the  N.T.  save  late  MSS.  in 
Matt.  7:2.  Even  here  some  MSS.  have  metrethesetai.  The 
anti  has  the  common  meaning  of  in  turn  or  back,  measured 
back  to  you  in  requital. 

39.  Also  a  parable  (kai  parabolen).  Plummer  thinks 
that  the  second  half  of  the  sermon  begins  here  as  indicated 
by  Luke's  insertion  of  "And  he  spake  (eipen  de)  at  this 
point.  Luke  has  the  word  parable  some  fifteen  times  both 
for  crisp  proverbs  and  for  the  longer  narrative  comparisons. 
This  is  the  only  use  of  the  term  parable  concerning  the  meta- 
phors in  the  Sermon  on  the  Mount.  But  in  both  Matthew 
and  Luke's  report  of  the  discourse  there  are  some  sixteen 
possible  applications  of  the  word.  Two  come  right  together: 
The  blind  leading  the  blind,  the  mote  and  the  beam.  Mat- 
thew gives  the  parabolic  proverb  of  the  blind  leading  the 
blind  later  (15:14).  Jesus  repeated  these  sayings  on  various 
occasions  as  every  teacher  does  his  characteristic  ideas. 
So  Luke  6:40  =  Matt.  10:24,  Luke  6:45  =  Matt.  12:34^ 
Can  {Meti  dunatai).  The  use  of  meti  in  the  question  shows 
that   a   negative   answer   is   expected.     Guide    (hodegein). 


94        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Common  verb  from  hodegos  (guide)  and  this  from  hodos 
(way)  and  hegeomai,  to  lead  or  guide.  Shall  they  not  both 
fall?  (ouchi  amphoteroi  empesountai;).  Ouchi,  a  sharpened 
negative  from  ouk,  in  a  question  expecting  the  answer  Yes. 
Future  middle  indicative  of  the  common  verb  empipto.  Into 
a  pit  ieis  bothunon).    Late  word  for  older  bothros. 

40.  The  disciple  is  not  above  his  master  {ouk  estin  mathetes 
huper  ton  didaskalon).  Literally,  a  learner  (or  pupil)  is 
not  above  the  teacher.  Precisely  so  in  Matt.  10:24  where 
"slave"  is  added  with  "lord."  But  here  Luke  adds:  "But 
everyone  when  he  is  perfected  shall  be  as  his  master" 
{katertismenos  de  pas  estai  hos  ho  didaskalos  autou).  The  state 
of  completion,  perfect  passive  participle,  is  noted  in  katertis- 
menos. The  word  is  common  for  mending  broken  things  or 
nets  (Matt.  4:21)  or  men  (Gal.  6:1).  So  it  is  a  long  process 
to  get  the  pupil  patched  up  to  the  plane  of  his  teacher. 

41.  Mote  (karphos)  and  beam  (dokon).  See  on  Matt.  7:3-5 
for  discussion  of  these  words  in  this  parabolic  proverb  kin  to 
several  of  ours  today. 

42.  Canst  thou  say  (dunasai  legein).  Here  Matt.  7:4  has 
wilt  thou  say  iereis).  Beholdest  not  (ou  blepbn).  Matt.  7:4 
has  "lo"  (idou).  Thou  hypocrite  (hupokrita).  Contrast  to 
the  studied  politeness  of  "brother"  (adelphe)  above.  Power- 
ful picture  of  blind  self-complacence  and  incompetence,  the 
keyword  to  argument  here. 

44.  Is  known  (ginosketai).  The  fruit  of  each  tree  reveals 
its  actual  character.  It  is  the  final  test.  This  sentence  is 
not  in  Matt.  7:17-20,  but  the  same  idea  is  in  the  repeated 
saying  (Matt.  7:16,  20):  "By  their  fruits  ye  shall  know 
them,"  where  the  verb  epignosesthe  means  full  knowledge. 
The  question  in  Matt.  7:16  is  put  here  in  positive  declara- 
tive form.  The  verb  is  in  the  plural  for  "men"  or  "people," 
sullegousin.  See  on  Matt.  7:16.  Bramble  bush  (batou). 
Old  word,  quoted  from  the  LXX  in  Mark  12:26,  Luke  20: 
37  (from  Ex.  3:6)  about  the  burning  bush  that  Moses  saw, 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  95 

and  by  Stephen  (Acts  7:30,  35)  referring  to  the  same  inci- 
dent. Nowhere  else  in  the  N.T.  "Galen  has  a  chapter  on 
its  medicinal  uses,  and  the  medical  writings  abound  in 
prescriptions  of  which  it  is  an  ingredient"  (Vincent).  Gather 
{trugbsin).  A  verb  common  in  Greek  writers  for  gathering 
ripe  fruit.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Rev.  I4:i8f.  Grapes 
{staphulen).    Cluster  of  grapes. 

45.  Bringeth  forth  {propherei).  In  a  similar  saying  re- 
peated later.  Matt.  12:341.  has  the  verb  ekballei  (throws  out, 
casts  out),  a  bolder  figure.  "When  men  are  natural,  heart 
and  mouth  act  in  concert.  But  otherwise  the  mouth  some- 
times professes  what  the  heart  does  not  feel"  (Plummer). 

46.  And  do  not  {kai  ou  poieite).  This  is  the  point  about 
every  sermon  that  counts.  The  two  parables  that  follow 
illustrate  this  point. 

47.  Hears  and  does  {akouon  kai  poibn).  Present  active 
participles.  So  in  Matt.  7:24.  (Present  indicative.)  /  will 
show  you  {hupodeixo  humin).    Only  in  Luke,  not  Matthew. 

48.  Digged  and  went  deep  {eskapsen  kai  ebathunen).  Two 
first  aorist  indicatives.  Not  a  hendiadys  for  dug  deep. 
Skapto,  to  dig,  is  as  old  as  Homer,  as  is  bathuno,  to  make  deep. 
And  laid  a  foundation  {kai  etheken  themelion).  That  is  the 
whole  point.  This  wise  builder  struck  the  rock  before  he 
laid  the  foundation.  When  a  flood  arose  {plemmures  geno- 
menes).  Genitive  absolute.  Late  word  for  flood,  plemmura, 
only  here  in  the  N.T.,  though  in  Job  40:18.  Brake  against 
(proserexen) .  First  aorist  active  indicative  from  prosregnumi 
and  in  late  writers  prosresso,  to  break  against.  Only  here 
in  the  N.T.  Matt.  7:25  has  prosepesan,  from  prospipto, 
to  fall  against.  Could  not  shake  it  (ouk  ischusen  saleusai 
auten).  Did  not  have  strength  enough  to  shake  it.  Because 
it  had  been  well  builded  {dia  to  kalos  oikodomesthai  auten). 
Perfect  passive  articular  infinitive  after  dia  and  with  accusa- 
tive of  general  reference. 

49.  He  that  heareth  and  doeth  not  {ho  de  akousas  kai  me 


96        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

poiesas).  Aorist  active  participle  with  article.  Particular 
case  singled  out  (punctiliar,  aorist).  Like  a  man  {homoios 
estin  anthropbi).  Associative  instrumental  case  after  homoios 
as  in  verse  47.  Upon  the  earth  {epi  ten  gen).  Matt.  7:26  has 
"upon  the  sand"  {epi  ten  ammon),  more  precise  and  worse 
than  mere  earth.  But  not  on  the  rock.  Without  a  founda- 
tion (choris  themeliou).  The  foundation  on  the  rock  after 
deep  digging  as  in  verse  48.  It  fell  in  (sunepesen).  Second 
aorist  active  of  sunpipto,  to  fall  together,  to  collapse.  An 
old  verb  from  Homer  on,  but  only  here  in  the  N.T.  The 
ruin  {to  regma).  The  crash  like  a  giant  oak  in  the  forest  re- 
sounded far  and  wide.  An  old  word  for  a  rent  or  fracture  as 
in  medicine  for  laceration  of  a  wound.    Only  here  in  the  N.T. 


CHAPTER  VII 

1.  After  {epeide,  epei  and  de).  This  conjunction  was 
written  epei  de  in  Homer  and  is  simple  epei  with  the  inten- 
sive de  added  and  even  epei  de  per  once  in  N.T.  (Luke 
I  :i).  This  is  the  only  instance  of  the  temporal  use  of  epeide 
in  the  N.T.  The  causal  sense  occurs  only  in  Luke  and  Paul, 
for  epei  is  the  correct  text  in  Matt.  21:46.  Had  ended 
(eplerosen).  First  aorist  active  indicative.  There  is  here  a 
reference  to  the  conclusion  of  the  Sermon  on  the  Mount, 
but  with  nothing  concerning  the  impression  produced  by 
the  discourse  such  as  is  seen  in  Matt.  7:28.  This  verse  really 
belongs  as  the  conclusion  of  Chapter  6,  not  as  the  beginning 
of  Chapter  7.  In  the  ears  of  the  people  {eis  tas  akoas  tou 
laou).  Akoe  from  akouo,  to  hear,  is  used  of  the  sense  of  hear- 
ing (I  Cor.  12:17),  tne  ear  with  which  one  hears  (Mark 
7:35;  Heb.  5:11),  the  thing  heard  or  the  report  (Rom.  10:16) 
or  oral  instruction  (Gal.  3:2,  5).  Both  Matt.  8:5-13  and 
Luke  7:1-10  locate  the  healing  of  the  centurion's  servant  in 
Capernaum  where  Jesus  was  after  the  Sermon  on  the  Mount. 

2.  Centurion' *s  servant  (Hekatontarchou  tinos  doulos). 
Slave  of  a  certain  centurion  (Latin  word  centurio,  com- 
mander of  a  century  or  hundred).  Mark  15:39,  44  has  the 
Latin  word  in  Greek  letters,  kenturion.  The  centurion  com- 
manded a  company  which  varied  from  fifty  to  a  hundred. 
Each  cohort  had  six  centuries.  Each  legion  had  ten  cohorts 
or  bands  (Acts  10:1).  The  centurions  mentioned  in  the  N.T. 
all  seem  to  be  fine  men  as  Polybius  states  that  the  best  men 
in  the  army  had  this  position.  See  also  Luke  23:47.  The 
Greek  has  two  forms  of  the  word,  both  from  hekaton,  hun- 
dred, and  archo,  to  rule,  and  they  appear  to  be  used  inter- 
changeably.    So  we  have  hekatontarchos;  here,  the  form  is 

97 


98        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

-archos,  and  hekatontarches,  the  form  is  -arches  in  verse  6. 
The  manuscripts  differ  about  it  in  almost  every  instance. 
The  -archos  form  is  accepted  by  Westcott  and  Hort  only  in 
the  nominative  save  the  genitive  singular  here  in  Luke  7:2 
and  the  accusative  singular  in  Acts  22:25.  See  like  varia- 
tion between  them  in  Matt.  8:5  and  8  (-archos)  and  13 
(archei).  So  also  -archon  (Acts  22:25)  an<^  -arches  (Acts 
22:26).  Dear  to  him  (autbi  entimos).  Held  in  honour,  prized, 
precious,  dear  (Luke  14:8;  I  Pet.  2:4;  Phil.  2:29),  common 
Greek  word.  Even  though  a  slave  he  was  dear  to  him.  Was 
sick  (kakbs  echbn).  Having  it  bad.  Common  idiom.  See 
already  Matt.  4:24,  8:16;  Mark  2:17;  Luke  5:31,  etc.  Matt. 
8:6  notes  that  the  slave  was  a  paralytic.  And  at  the  point 
of  death  (emellen  teleutdin).  Imperfect  active  of  mello  (note 
double  augment  e)  which  is  used  either  with  the  present  infin- 
itive as  here,  the  aorist  (Rev.  3:16),  or  even  the  future  be- 
cause of  the  future  idea  in  mello  (Acts  11:28;  24:15).  He 
was  about  to  die. 

3.  Sent  unto  him  elders  of  the  Jews  (apesteilen  pros  auton 
presbuterous  ton  Ioudaibn).  Matt.  8:5  says  "the  centurion 
came  unto  him."  For  discussion  of  this  famous  case  of 
apparent  discrepancy  see  discussion  on  Matthew.  One  pos- 
sible solution  is  that  Luke  tells  the  story  as  it  happened  with 
the  details,  whereas  Matthew  simply  presents  a  summary 
statement  without  the  details.  What  one  does  through 
another  he  does  himself.  Asking  him  (erbtbn  auton).  Pres- 
ent active  participle,  masculine  singular  nominative,  of 
the  verb  erbtab  common  for  asking  a  question  as  in  the  old 
Greek  (Luke  22:68).  But  more  frequently  in  the  N.T.  the 
verb  has  the  idea  of  making  a  request  as  here.  This  is  not  a 
Hebraism  or  an  Aramaism,  but  is  a  common  meaning  of 
the  verb  in  the  papyri  (Deissmann,  Light  from  the  Ancient 
East,  p.  168).  It  is  to  be  noted  here  that  Luke  represents 
the  centurion  himself  as  "asking"  through  the  elders  of 
the  Jews    (leading    citizens).     In    Matt.    8:6  the  verb  is 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  99 

parakalbn  (beseeching).  That  he  would  come  and  save  (hopos 
elthbn  diasbsei).  Hina  is  the  more  common  final  or  sub- 
final  (as  here)  conjunction,  but  hopos  still  occurs.  Diasbsei 
is  effective  aorist  active  subjunctive,  to  bring  safe  through 
as  in  a  storm  (Acts  28:  1,  4).    Common  word. 

4.  Besought  (parekaloun).  Imperfect  active,  began  and 
kept  on  beseeching.  This  is  the  same  verb  used  by  Mat- 
thew in  8:5  of  the  centurion  himself.  Earnestly  (spoudaibs). 
From  spoude  haste.  So  eagerly,  earnestly,  zealously,  for 
time  was  short.  That  thou  shouldst  do  this  for  him  (hoi 
parexei  touto).  Second  future  middle  singular  of  par  echo. 
Old  and  common  verb,  furnish  on  thy  part.  Hoi  is  rela- 
tive in  dative  case  almost  with  notion  of  contemplated  re- 
sult (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  961). 

5.  For  {gar).  This  clause  gives  the  reason  why  the  elders 
of  the  Jews  consider  him  "worthy"  (axios,  drawing  down 
the  scale,  axis,  ago).  He  was  hardly  a  proselyte,  but  was  a 
Roman  who  had  shown  his  love  for  the  Jews.  Himself 
(autos).  All  by  himself  and  at  his  own  expense.  Us  (hemin). 
Dative  case,  for  us.  It  is  held  by  some  archaeologists  that 
the  black  basalt  ruins  in  Tell  Hum  are  the  remains  of  the 
very  synagogue  (ten  sunagbgen).  Literally,  the  synagogue, 
the  one  which  we  have,  the  one  for  us. 

6.  Went  with  them  (eporeueto  sun  autois).  Imperfect  in- 
dicative middle.  He  started  to  go  along  with  them.  Now 
(ede).  Already  like  Latin  jam.  In  I  Cor.  4:8  nun  ede  like 
jam  nunc.  Sent  friends  (epempsen  philous).  This  second 
embassy  also,  wanting  in  Matthew's  narrative.  He  "puts 
the  message  of  both  into  the  mouth  of  the  centurion  him- 
self" (Plummer).  Note  saying  (legbn),  present  active  singu- 
lar participle,  followed  by  direct  quotation  from  the  cen- 
turion himself.  Trouble  not  thyself  (Me  skullou).  Present 
middle  (direct  use)  imperative  of  skullb,  old  verb  originally 
meaning  to  skin,  to  mangle,  and  then  in  later  Greek  to  vex, 
trouble,  annoy.    Frequent  in  the  papyri  in  this  latter  sense. 


IOO      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

For  I  am  not  worthy  that  (ou  gar  hikanos  eimi  hind).  The 
same  word  hikanos ',  not  axios,  as  in  Matt.  8:8,  which  see  for 
discussion,  from  hiko,  hikano,  to  fit,  to  reach,  be  adequate 
for.  Hina  in  both  places  as  common  in  late  Greek.  See 
Matt.  8:8  also  for  "roof"  (stegen,  covering). 

7.  Wherefore  neither  thought  I  myself  worthy  to  come  unto 
thee  (dio  oude  emauton  exiosa  pros  se  elthein).  Not  in  Mat- 
thew because  he  represents  the  centurion  as  coming  to 
Jesus.  Speak  the  word  (eipe  logoi).  As  in  Matt.  8:8.  Second 
aorist  active  imperative  with  instrumental  case,  speak  with 
a  word.  My  servant  shall  be  healed  (iatheto  ho  pais  mou). 
Imperative  first  aorist  passive,  let  be  healed.  Pais  literally 
means  "boy,"  an  affectionate  term  for  the  "slave,"  doulos 
(verse  2),  who  was  "dear"  to  him. 

8.  ''Set"  (tassomenos).  Genuine  here,  though  doubtful 
in  Matt.  8:9  where  see  discussion  of  this  vivid  and  charac- 
teristic speech  of  the  centurion. 

9.  Turned  (strapheis).  Second  aorist  passive  participle  of 
strepho,  to  turn.  Common  verb.  A  vivid  touch  not  in 
Matthew's  account.  In  both  Matthew  and  Luke  Jesus 
marvels  at  the  great  faith  of  this  Roman  centurion  beyond 
that  among  the  Jews.  As  a  military  man  he  had  learned  how 
to  receive  orders  and  to  execute  them  and  hence  to  expect 
obedience  to  his  commands,  He  recognized  Jesus  as  Master 
over  disease  with  power  to  compel  obedience. 

10.  Whole   (hugiainonta) .     Sound,  well.     See  Luke  5:31. 

11.  Soon  afterwards  (en  toi  hexes).  According  to  this  read- 
ing supply  chronoi,  time.  Other  MSS.  read  tei  hexes  (supply 
hemerdi,  day).  Hexes  occurs  in  Luke  and  Acts  in  the  N.T. 
though  old  adverb  of  time.  That  (Hoti).  Not  in  the  Greek, 
the  two  verbs  egeneto  and  eporeuthe  having  no  connective 
(asyndeton).  Went  with  him  (suneporeuonto  autoi).  Imper- 
fect middle  picturing  the  procession  of  disciples  and  the 
crowd  with  Jesus.  Nain  is  not  mentioned  elsewhere  in  the 
N.T.     There  is  today  a  hamlet  about  two  miles  west  of 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  ioi 

Endor  on  the  north  slope  of  Little  Hermon.  There  is  a 
burying-place  still  in  use.  Robinson  and  Stanley  think  that 
the  very  road  on  which  the  crowd  with  Jesus  met  the  funeral 
procession  can  be  identified. 

12.  Behold  (kai  idou).  The  kai  introduces  the  apodosis 
of  the  temporal  sentence  and  has  to  be  left  out  in  translations. 
It  is  a  common  idiom  in  Luke,  kai  idou.  There  was  carried 
out  (exekomizeto) .  Imperfect  passive  indicative.  Common 
verb  in  late  Greek  for  carrying  out  a  body  for  burial,  though 
here  only  in  the  N.T.  (ekkomizo).  Rock  tombs  outside 
of  the  village  exist  there  today.  One  that  was  dead  (tethne- 
kos).  Perfect  active  participle  of  thnesko,  to  die.  The  only 
son  of  his  mother  (monogenes  huios  iei  metri  autou).  Only 
begotten  son  to  his  mother  (dative  case).  The  compound 
adjective  monogenes  (monos  and  genos)  is  common  in  the  old 
Greek  and  occurs  in  the  N.T.  about  Jesus  (John  3:16,  18). 
The  "  death  of  a  widow's  only  son  was  the  greatest  misfortune 
conceivable"  (Easton).  And  she  was  a  widow  (kai  aute  en 
chera).  This  word  chera  gives  the  finishing  touch  to  the 
pathos  of  the  situation.  The  word  is  from  cheros,  bereft. 
The  mourning  of  a  widow  for  an  only  son  is  the  extremity 
of  grief  (Plummer).  Much  people  (ochlos  hikanos).  Con- 
siderable crowd  as  often  with  this  adjective  hikanos.  Some 
were  hired  mourners,  but  the  size  of  the  crowd  showed  the 
real  sympathy  of  the  town  for  her. 

13.  The  Lord  saw  her  (idon  auten  ho  kurios).  The  Lord  of 
Life  confronts  death  (Plummer)  and  Luke  may  use  Kurios 
here  purposely.  Had  compassion  (esplagchthe).  First  aorist 
(ingressive)  passive  indicative  of  splagchnizomai.  Often  love 
and  pity  are  mentioned  as  the  motives  for  Christ's  miracles 
(Matt.  14:14;  15:32,  etc.).  It  is  confined  to  the  Synoptics 
in  the  N.T.  and  about  Christ  save  in  the  parables  by  Christ. 
Weep  not  (me  klaie).  Present  imperative  in  a  prohibition. 
Cease  weeping. 

14.  Touched  the  bier  (hepsato  tou  sorou).    An  urn  for  the 


102      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

bones  or  ashes  of  the  dead  in  Homer,  then  the  coffin  (Gen. 
5:26),  then  the  funeral  couch  or  bier  as  here.  Only  here  in 
the  N.T.  Jesus  touched  the  bier  to  make  the  bearers  stop, 
which  they  did  (stood  still,  estesan),  second  aorist  active 
indicative   of   histemi. 

15.  Sat  up  (anekathisen).  First  aorist  active  indicative. 
The  verb  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  9:40.  Medical 
writers  often  used  it  of  the  sick  sitting  up  in  bed  (Hobart, 
Med.  Lang,  of  St.  Luke,  p.  n).  It  is  objected  that  the  sym- 
metry of  these  cases  (daughter  of  Jairus  raised  from  the  death- 
bed, this  widow's  son  raised  from  the  bier,  Lazarus  raised 
from  the  tomb)  is  suspicious,  but  no  one  Gospel  gives  all 
three  (Plummer).  Gave  him  to  his  mother  (edoken  auton  iei 
metri  autou).  Tender  way  of  putting  it.  "For  he  had 
already  ceased  to  belong  to  his  mother"  (Bengel).  So  in 
Luke  9:42. 

16.  Fear  seized  all  (elaben  de  phobos  pantas).  Aorist  active 
indicative.  At  once.  They  glorified  God  (edoxazon  ton  theon). 
Imperfect  active,  inchoative,  began  and  increased. 

17.  This  report  (ho  logos  houtos).  That  God  had  raised 
up  a  great  prophet  who  had  shown  his  call  by  raising  the 
dead. 

18.  And  the  disciples  of  John  told  him  (kai  apeggeilan 
Ioanei  hoi  mathetai  autou).  Literally,  and  his  disciples 
announced  to  John.  Such  news  (verse  17)  was  bound  to  come 
to  the  ears  of  the  Baptist  languishing  in  the  dungeon  of 
Machaerus  (Luke  3:20).  Luke  7:18-35  runs  parallel  with 
Matt.  11:2-19,  a  specimen  of  Q,  the  non-Marcan  portion  of 
Matthew  and  Luke. 

19.  Calling  unto  him  (proskalesamenos).  First  aorist  middle 
(indirect)  participle.  Two  (duo  tinas).  Certain  two.  Not 
in  Matt.  11:2.  Saying  (legbn).  John  saying  by  the  two 
messengers.  The  message  is  given  precisely  alike  in  Matt. 
11:3,  which  see.  In  both  we  have  heteron  for  "another," 
either  a  second  or  a  different  kind.    In  verse  20  Westcott  and 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  103 

Hort  read  allon  in  the  text,  heteron  in  the  margin.  Prosdoko- 
men,  may  be  present  indicative  or  present  subjunctive 
(deliberative),  the  same  contract  form  {ao  =  0,  ao  0). 

21.  In  that  hour  he  cured  {en  ekeinei  tei  hordi  ether apeus en). 
This  item  is  not  in  Matthew.  Jesus  gave  the  two  disciples 
of  John  an  example  of  the  direct  method.  They  had  heard. 
Then  they  saw  for  themselves.  Diseases  (noson),  plagues 
(mastigon),  evil  spirits  {pneumaton  poneron),  all  kinds  of 
bodily  ills,  and  he  singles  out  the  blind  (tuphlois)  to  whom  in 
particular  he  bestowed  sight  (echarizato  blepein),  gave  as  a 
free  gift  (from  charis,  grace)  seeing  {blepein). 

22.  What  things  ye  have  seen  and  heard  {ha  eidete  kai 
ekousate).  In  Matt.  11:4,  present  tense  "which  ye  do  hear 
and  see."  Rest  of  verse  22  and  23  as  in  Matt.  11:4-6, 
which  see  for  details.  Luke  mentions  no  raisings  from  the 
dead  in  verse  21,  but  the  language  is  mainly  general,  while 
here  it  is  specific.  Skandalizomai  used  here  has  the  double 
notion  of  to  trip  up  and  to  entrap  and  in  the  N.T.  always 
means  causing  to  sin. 

24.  When  the  messengers  of  John  were  departed  {apelthonton 
ton  aggelon  Ibanou).  Genitive  absolute  of  aorist  active 
participle.  Matt.  11:7  has  the  present  middle  participle 
poreuomenon,  suggesting  that  Jesus  began  his  eulogy  of  John 
as  soon  as  the  messengers  (angels,  Luke  calls  them)  were  on 
their  way.  The  vivid  questions  about  the  people's  interest 
in  John  are  precisely  alike  in  both  Matthew  and  Luke. 

25.  Gorgeously  apparelled  {en  himatismoi  endoxoi).  In 
splendid  clothing.  Here  alone  in  this  sense  in  the  N.T. 
And  live  delicately  {truphei).  From  thrupto  to  break  down,  to 
enervate,  an  old  word  for  luxurious  living.  See  the  verb 
truphao  in  James  5:5.  In  kings1  courts  {en  tois  basileiois). 
Only  here  in  the  N.T.  Matt.  11:8  has  it  "in  kings'  houses." 
Verses  26  and  27  are  precisely  alike  in  Matt.  119  and  10, 
which  see  for  discussion. 

26.  A  prophet?  {propheten;).    A  real  prophet  will  always  get 


104      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

a  hearing  if  he  has  a  message  from  God.  He  is  a  for-speaker, 
forth-teller  {pro-phetes).  He  may  or  may  not  be  a  fore-teller. 
The  main  thing  is  for  the  prophet  to  have  a  message  from 
God  which  he  is  willing  to  tell  at  whatever  cost  to  himself. 
The  word  of  God  came  to  John  in  the  wilderness  of  Judea 
(Luke  3:2).  That  made  him  a  prophet.  There  is  a  prophetic 
element  in  every  real  preacher  of  the  Gospel.  Real  prophets 
become  leaders   and  moulders  of  men. 

28.  There  is  none  {oudeis  estin).  No  one  exists,  this  means. 
Matt.  1 1  :i  1  has  ouk  egegertai  (hath not  arisen).  See  Matthew 
for  discussion  of  "but  little"  and  "greater." 

29.  Justified  God  {edikaiosan  ton  theon).  They  considered 
God  just  or  righteous  in  making  these  demands  of  them. 
Even  the  publicans  did.  They  submitted  to  the  baptism  of 
John  {baptisthentes  to  baptisma  tou  Ioanou.  First  aorist  pas- 
sive participle  with  the  cognate  accusative  retained  in  the 
passive.  Some  writers  consider  verses  29  and  30  a  comment 
of  Luke  in  the  midst  of  the  eulogy  of  John  by  Jesus.  This 
would  be  a  remarkable  thing  for  so  long  a  comment  to  be 
interjected.     It  is  perfectly  proper  as  the  saying  of  Jesus. 

30.  Rejected  for  themselves  (ethetesan  eis  heautous).  The 
first  aorist  active  of  atheteb  first  seen  in  LXX  and  Polybius. 
Occurs  in  the  papyri.  These  legalistic  interpreters  of  the 
law  refused  to  admit  the  need  of  confession  of  sin  on  their 
part  and  so  set  aside  the  baptism  of  John.  They  annulled 
God's  purposes  of  grace  so  far  as  they  applied  to  them. 
Being  not  baptized  by  him  {me  baptisthentes  hup*  autou. 
First  aorist  passive  participle.  Me  is  the  usual  negative  of 
the  participle  in  the  Koine. 

31.  And  to  what  are  they  like?  (kai  tini  eisin  homoioi;). 
This  second  question  is  not  in  Matt.  11  :i6.  It  sharpens  the 
point.  The  case  of  tini  is  associative  instrumental  after 
homoioi.    See  discussion  of  details  in  Matthew. 

32.  And  ye  did  not  weep  {kai  ouk  eklausate).  Here  Matt. 
11:17  has  "and  ye  did  not  mourn  (or  beat  your  breast,  ouk 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  I05 

ekopsasthe).    They  all  did   it   at  funerals.    These  children 
would  not  play  wedding  or  funeral. 

33.  John  the  Baptist  is  come  (eleluthen).  Second  perfect 
active  indicative  where  Matt.  11:18  has  elthen  second  aorist 
active  indicative.  So  as  to  verse  34.  Luke  alone  has 
"bread"  and  "wine."  Otherwise  these  verses  like  Matt. 
11  :i8  and  19,  which  see  for  discussion  of  details.  There  are 
actually  critics  today  who  say  that  Jesus  was  called  the 
friend  of  sinners  and  even  of  harlots  because  he  loved  them 
and  their  ways  and  so  deserved  the  slur  cast  upon  him  by  his 
enemies.  If  men  can  say  that  today  we  need  not  wonder 
that  the  Pharisees  and  lawyers  said  it  then  to  justify  their 
own  rejection  of  Jesus. 

35.  Oj  all  her  children  (apo  panibn  ion  teknbn  antes).  Here 
Matt.  11  :ig  has  "by  her  works"  (apo  ton  ergon  antes).  Aleph 
has  ergon  here.  The  use  of  "children"  personifies  wisdom  as 
in  Prov.  8  and  9. 

36.  That  he  would  eat  with  him  (hina  phagei  met'  autou). 
Second  aorist  active  subjunctive.  The  use  of  hina  after 
erbtab  (see  also  Luke  16:27)  is  on  the  border  between  the 
pure  object  clause  and  the  indirect  question  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  p.  1046)  and  the  pure  final  clause.  Luke  has  two 
other  instances  of  Pharisees  who  invited  Jesus  to  meals 
(11 :37;  14:1)  and  he  alone  gives  them.  This  is  the  Gospel  of 
Hospitality  (Ragg).  Jesus  would  dine  with  a  Pharisee  or 
with  a  publican  (Luke  5 129  =  Mark  2:15  =  Matt.  9:10)  and 
even  invited  himself  to  be  the  guest  of  Zaccheus  (Luke  9:5). 
This  Pharisee  was  not  as  hostile  as  the  leaders  in  Jerusalem. 
It  is  not  necessary  to  think  this  Pharisee  had  any  sinister 
motive  in  his  invitation  though  he  was  not  overly  friendly 
(Plummer). 

37.  A  woman  which  was  in  the  city,  a  sinner  (gune  hetis  en 
tei  polei  hamartblos).  Probably  in  Capernaum.  The  use  of 
hetis  means  "Who  was  of  such  a  character  as  to  be"  (cf.  8:3) 
and  so  more  than  merely  the  relative  he,  who,   that  is, 


106      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

"who  was  a  sinner  in  the  city,"  a  woman  of  the  town,  in 
other  words,  and  known  to  be  such.  Hamartolos,  from 
hamartano,  to  sin,  means  devoted  to  sin  and  uses  the  same 
form  for  feminine  and  masculine.  It  is  false  and  unjust  to 
Mary  Magdalene,  introduced  as  a  new  character  in  Luke 
8:2,  to  identify  this  woman  with  her.  Luke  would  have  no 
motive  in  concealing  her  name  here  and  the  life  of  a  courtesan 
would  be  incompatible  with  the  sevenfold  possession  of 
demons.  Still  worse  is  it  to  identify  this  courtesan  not  only 
with  Mary  Magdalene,  but  also  with  Mary  of  Bethany 
simply  because  it  is  a  Simon  who  gives  there  a  feast  to  Jesus 
when  Mary  of  Bethany  does  a  beautiful  deed  somewhat  like 
this  one  here  (Mark  14:3-9  =  Matt.  26:6-13  =  John  12;  2-8). 
Certainly  Luke  knew  full  well  the  real  character  of  Mary  of 
Bethany  (10:38-42)  so  beautifully  pictured  by  him.  But 
a  falsehood,  once  started,  seems  to  have  more  lives  than  the 
cat's  proverbial  nine.  The  very  name  Magdalene  has  come 
to  mean  a  repentant  courtesan.  But  we  can  at  least  refuse  to 
countenance  such  a  slander  on  Mary  Magdalene  and  on  Mary 
of  Bethany.  This  sinful  woman  had  undoubtedly  repented 
and  changed  her  life  and  wished  to  show  her  gratitude  to 
Jesus  who  had  rescued  her.  Her  bad  reputation  as  a  harlot 
clung  to  her  and  made  her  an  unwelcome  visitor  in  the 
Pharisee's  house.  When  she  knew  (epignousa).  Second 
aorist  active  participle  from  epiginosko,  to  know  fully,  to 
recognize.  She  came  in  by  a  curious  custom  of  the  time  that 
allowed  strangers  to  enter  a  house  uninvited  at  a  feast,  es- 
pecially beggars  seeking  a  gift.  This  woman  was  an  intruder 
whereas  Mary  of  Bethany  was  an  invited  guest.  "Many 
came  in  and  took  their  places  on  the  side  seats,  uninvited  and 
yet  unchallenged.  They  spoke  to  those  at  table  on  business 
or  the  news  of  the  day,  and  our  host  spoke  freely  to  them" 
(Trench  in  his  Parables,  describing  a  dinner  at  a  Consul's 
house  at  Damietta).  He  was  sitting  at  meat  (katakeitai). 
Literally,  he  is  reclining  (present  tense  retained  in  indirect 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  107 

discourse  in  Greek).  An  alabaster  cruse  of  ointment  {alabas- 
tron  murou).  See  on  Matt.  26:7  for  discussion  of  alabastron 
and  murou. 

38.  Standing  behind  at  his  feet  {stasa  opiso  para  tous  podas 
autou).  Second  aorist  active  participle  from  hisiemi  and 
intransitive,  first  aorist  estesa  being  transitive.  The  guest 
removed  his  sandals  before  the  meal  and  he  reclined  on  the 
left  side  with  the  feet  outward.  She  was  standing  beside 
{para)  his  feet  weeping  (klaiousa).  She  was  drawn  irresist- 
ibly by  gratitude  to  Jesus  and  is  overcome  with  emotion 
before  she  can  use  the  ointment;  her  tears  (tois  dakrusin, 
instrumental  case  of  dakru)  take  the  place  of  the  ointment. 
Wiped  them  with  the  hair  of  her  head  (tais  thrixin  tes  kephales 
autes  exemassen).  Inchoative  imperfect  of  an  old  verb 
ekmasso,  to  rub  out  or  off,  began  to  wipe  off,  an  act  of  impulse 
evidently  and  of  embarrassment.  "Among  the  Jews  it  was  a 
shameful  thing  for  a  woman  to  let  down  her  hair  in  public; 
but  she  makes  this  sacrifice"  (Plummer).  So  Mary  of  Beth- 
any wiped  the  feet  of  Jesus  with  her  hair  (John  12:3)  with  a 
similar  sacrifice  out  of  her  great  love  for  Jesus.  This  fact  is 
relied  on  by  some  to  prove  that  Mary  of  Bethany  had  been  a 
woman  of  bad  character,  surely  an  utter  failure  to  recognize 
Mary's  motive  and  act.  Kissed  (katephilei).  Imperfect  active 
of  kataphileo,  to  kiss  repeatedly  (force  of  kata),  and  accented 
by  the  tense  of  continued  action  here.  The  word  in  the  N.T. 
occurs  here,  of  the  prodigal's  father  (15:20),  of  the  kiss  of 
Judas  (Mark  14:45  =Matt.  26:49),  of  the  Ephesian  elders 
(Acts  20 :37) .  "  Kissing  the  feet  was  a  common  mark  of  deep 
reverence,  especially  to  leading  rabbis"  (Plummer).  Anointed 
them  with  the  ointment  {eleiphen  toi  muroi) .  Imperfect  active 
again  of  aleipho,  a  very  common  verb.  Chrio  has  a  more 
religious  sense.  The  anointing  came  after  the  burst  of  emo- 
tional excitement. 

39.  This  man  (houtos).  Contemptuous,  this  fellow.  If  he 
were  a  {the)  prophet  {ei en  [ho]  prophetes).    Condition  of  the 


108      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

second  class,  determined  as  unfulfilled.  The  Pharisee  as- 
sumes that  Jesus  is  not  a  prophet  (or  the  prophet,  reading  of 
B,  that  he  claims  to  be).  A  Greek  condition  puts  the  thing 
from  the  standpoint  of  the  speaker  or  writer.  It  does  not 
deal  with  the  actual  facts,  but  only  with  the  statement  about 
the  facts.  Would  have  perceived  (eginosken  an).  Wrong 
translation,  would  now  perceive  or  know  (which  he  assumes 
that  Jesus  does  not  do).  The  protasis  is  false  and  the  con- 
clusion also.  He  is  wrong  in  both.  The  conclusion  (apodosis) , 
like  the  condition,  deals  here  with  the  present  situation  and 
so  both  use  the  imperfect  indicative  (an  in  the  conclusion, 
a  mere  device  for  making  it  plain  that  it  is  not  a  condition 
of  the  first  class).  Who  and  what  manner  of  woman  (tis  kai 
potape  he  gune).    She  was  notorious  in  person  and  character. 

40.  Answering  (apokritheis).  First  aorist  passive  parti- 
ciple, redundant  use  with  eipen.  Jesus  answers  the  thoughts 
and  doubts  of  Simon  and  so  shows  that  he  knows  all  about 
the  woman  also.    Godet  notes  a  tone  of  Socratic  irony  here. 

41.  A  certain  lender  (danistei  tini).  A  lender  of  money 
with  interest.  Here  alone  in  the  N.T.  though  a  common 
word.  Debtors  (chreophiletai).  From  chreo  (debt,  obligation) 
and  opheilo,  to  owe.  Only  here  and  16:5  in  the  N.T.,  though 
common  in  late  Greek  writers.  Owed  (opheilen).  Imperfect 
active  and  so  unpaid.  Five  hundred  denaria  and  fifty  like 
two  hundred  and  fifty  dollars  and  twenty-five  dollars. 

42.  Will  love  him  most  (pleion  agapesei  auton).  Strictly, 
comparative  more,  pleion,  not  superlative  pleista,  but  most 
suits  the  English  idiom  best,  even  between  two.  Superlative 
forms  are  vanishing  before  the  comparative  in  the  KoinS. 
This  is  the  point  of  the  parable,  the  attitude  of  the  two  debt- 
ors toward  the  lender  who  forgave  both  of  them  (Plummer). 

43.  /  suppose  (hupolambano).  Old  verb,  originally  to 
take  up  from  under,  to  bear  away  as  on  high,  to  take  up  in 
speech  (Luke  10:30),  to  take  up  in  mind  or  to  assume  as  here 
and  Acts  2:15.    Here  with  an  air  of  supercilious  indifference 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  109 

(Plummer).  The  most  {to  pleion).  The  more.  Rightly 
{orthos).  Correctly.  Socrates  was  fond  of  panu  orthos.  The 
end  of  the  argument. 

44.  Turning  (strapheis).  Second  aorist  passive  participle. 
See st  thou  {blepeis).  For  the  first  time  Jesus  looks  at  the 
woman  and  he  asks  the  Pharisee  to  look  at  her.  She  was 
behind  Jesus.  Jesus  was  an  invited  guest.  The  Pharisee 
had  neglected  some  points  of  customary  hospitality.  The 
contrasts  here  made  have  the  rhythm  of  Hebrew  poetry. 
In  each  contrast  the  first  word  is  the  point  of  defect  in 
Simon:  water  (44),  kiss  (45),  oil  (46). 

45.  Hath  not  ceased  to  kiss  (ou  dielipen  kataphilousa). 
Supplementary  participle. 

46.  With  ointment  {muroi).  Instrumental  case.  She  used 
the  costly  ointment  even  for  the  feet  of  Jesus. 

47.  Are  forgiven  {apheontai).  Doric  perfect  passive  form. 
See  Luke  5:21,  23.  For  she  loved  much  {hoti  egapesen  polu). 
Illustration  or  proof,  not  reason  for  the  forgiveness.  Her 
sins  had  been  already  forgiven  and  remained  forgiven.  But 
to  whom  little  is  forgiven,  the  same  loveth  little  {Hoi  de  oligon 
aphietai  oligon  agapai).  This  explanation  proves  that  the 
meaning  of  hoti  preceding  is  proof,  not  cause. 

48.  Are  forgiven  {apheontai).  As  in  verse  47.  Remain 
forgiven,  Jesus  means,  in  spite  of  the  slur  of  the  Pharisee. 

49.  Who  even  forgiveth  sins  {hos  kai  hamartias  aphiesin). 
Present  indicative  active  of  same  verb,  aphiemi.  Once  before 
the  Pharisees  considered  Jesus  guilty  of  blasphemy  in  claim- 
ing the  power  to  forgive  sins  (Luke  5:21).  Jesus  read  their 
inmost  thoughts  as  he  always  does. 


CHAPTER  VIII 

i.  Soon  afterwards  {en  tbi  kathexes).  In  7:11  we  have  en 
tbi  hexes.  This  word  means  one  after  the  other,  successively, 
but  that  gives  no  definite  data  as  to  the  time,  only  that  this 
incident  in  8:1-3  follows  that  in  7:36-50.  Both  in  Luke 
alone.  That  {kai).  One  of  Luke's  idioms  with  kai  egeneto 
like  Hebrew  wav.  Went  about  {diodeuen).  Imperfect  active 
of  diodeub,  to  make  one's  way  through  {dia,  hodos),  common 
in  late  Greek  writers.  In  the  N.T.  here  only  and  Acts  17:1. 
Through  cities  and  villages  {kola  polin  kai  kbmen).  Distribu- 
tive use  of  kata  (up  and  down).  The  clause  is  amphibolous 
and  goes  equally  well  with  diodeuen  or  with  kerussbn  (herald- 
ing) kai  euaggelizomenos  (evangelizing,  gospelizing).  This 
is  the  second  tour  of  Galilee,  this  time  the  Twelve  with  him. 

2.  Which  had  been  healed  [hai  esan  tetherapeumenai). 
Periphrastic  past  perfect  passive,  suggesting  that  the  healing 
had  taken  place  some  time  before  this  tour.  These  women 
all  had  personal  grounds  of  gratitude  to  Jesus.  From  whom 
seven  devils  {demons)  had  gone  out  {apK  hes  daimonia  hepta 
exeleluthei).  Past  perfect  active  third  singular  for  the 
daimonia  are  neuter  plural.  This  first  mention  of  Mary 
Magdalene  describes  her  special  cause  of  gratitude.  This 
fact  is  stated  also  in  Mark  16:9  in  the  disputed  close  of  the 
Gospel.  The  presence  of  seven  demons  in  one  person  indi- 
cates special  malignity  (Mark  5:9).  See  Matt.  12:45  for 
the  parable  of  the  demon  who  came  back  with  seven  other 
demons  worse  than  the  first.  It  is  not  known  where  Magdala 
was,  whence  Mary  came. 

3.  Joanna  {Ibana).  Her  husband  Chuza,  steward  {epi- 
tropou)  of  Herod,  is  held  by  some  to  be  the  nobleman  {basi- 
likos)  of  John  4:46-53  who  believed  and  all  his  house.    At 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  III 

any  rate  Christ  had  a  follower  from  the  household  of  Herod 
Antipas  who  had  such  curiosity  to  see  and  hear  him.  One 
may  recall  also  Manaen  (Acts  13:1),  Herod's  foster  brother. 
Joanna  is  mentioned  again  with  Mary  Magdalene  in  Luke 
24:10.  Who  ministered  unto  them  {haitines  diekonoun  autois). 
Imperfect  active  of  diakoneo,  common  verb,  but  note  aug- 
ment as  if  from  dia  and  akoneo,  but  from  diakonos  and  that 
from  dia  and  konis  (dust).  The  very  fact  that  Jesus  now 
had  twelve  men  going  with  him  called  for  help  from  others 
and  the  women  of  means  responded  to  the  demand.  Of  their 
substance  {ek  ton  huparchonton  autais).  From  the  things 
belonging  to  them.  This  is  the  first  woman's  missionary 
society  for  the  support  of  missionaries  of  the  Gospel.  They 
had  difficulties  in  their  way,  but  they  overcame  these,  so 
great  was  their  gratitude  and  zeal. 

4.  By  a  parable  {dia  paraboles).  Mark  4:2  says  "in  par- 
ables" as  does  Matt.  13:3.  This  is  the  beginning  of  the  first 
great  group  of  parables  as  given  in  Mark  4:1-34  and  Matt. 
13:1-53.  There  are  ten  of  these  parables  in  Mark  and  Mat- 
thew and  only  two  in  Luke  8 :4~i8  (The  Sower  and  the  Lamp, 
8:16)  though  Luke  also  has  the  expression  "in  parables" 
(8:10).  See  Matt.  13  and  Mark  4  for  discussion  of  the  word 
parable  and  the  details  of  the  Parable  of  the  Sower.  Luke 
does  not  locate  the  place,  but  he  mentions  the  great  crowds 
on  hand,  while  both  Mark  and  Matthew  name  the  seaside 
as  the  place  where  Jesus  was  at  the  start  of  the  series  of 
parables. 

5.  His  seed  {ton  sporon  autou).  Peculiar  to  Luke.  Was 
trodden  under  foot  {katepatethe).  First  aorist  passive  indica- 
tive of  katapateo.  Peculiar  to  Luke  here.  Of  the  heavens 
{tou  ouranou).    Added  in  Luke. 

6.  Upon  the  rock  {epi  ten  petran).  Mark  4:5  "the  rocky 
ground"  {epi  to  petrodes).  Matt.  13:5  "the  rocky  places. 
As  soon  as  it  grew  {phuen).  Second  aorist  passive  participle 
of  phuo,  an  old  verb  to  spring  up  like  a  sprout.     Withered 


112      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

away  (exeranthe).  First  aorist  passive  indicative  of  zeraino, 
old  verb,  to  dry  up.  Moisture  (ikmada).  Here  only  in  the 
N.T.,  though  common  word. 

7.  Amidst  the  thorns  {en  mesoi  ion  akanthbn).  Mark  4:7 
has  eis  (among)  and  Matt.  13:7  has  epi  "upon."  Grew  with 
it  (sunphueisai).  Same  participle  as  phuen  above  with  sun- 
(together).  Choked  (apepnixan).  From  apopnigo,  to  choke 
off  as  in  Matt.  13:7.  In  Mark  4:7  the  verb  is  sunepnixan 
(choked  together). 

8.  A  hundredfold  (hekatonplasiona).  Luke  omits  the  thirty 
and  sixty  of  Mark  4:8  and  Matt.  13:8.  He  cried  (ephonei). 
Imperfect  active,  and  in  a  loud  voice,  the  verb  means.  The 
warning  about  hearing  with  the  ears  occurs  also  in  Mark  4:9 
and  Matt.  13:9. 

9.  Asked  (eperoton).  Imperfect  of  eperotao  {epi  and  erbtao) 
where  Mark  4:10  has  erbtbn  (uncompounded  imperfect), 
both  the  tense  and  the  use  of  epi  indicate  eager  and  repeated 
questions  on  the  part  of  the  disciples,  perhaps  dimly  perceiv- 
ing a  possible  reflection  on  their  own  growth.  What  this 
parable  might  be  {tis  haute  eie  he  parabole).  A  mistranslation, 
What  this  parable  was  (or  meant).  The  optative  eie  is 
merely  due  to  indirect  discourse,  changing  the  indicative 
estin  (is)  of  the  direct  question  to  the  optative  eie  of  the 
indirect,  a  change  entirely  with  the  writer  or  speaker  and 
without  any  change  of  meaning  (Robertson,  Grammar, 
pp.  I043f.). 

10.  The  mysteries  {ta  musteria).  See  for  this  word  on 
Matt.  13:11=  Mark  4:11.  Part  of  the  mystery  here  explained 
is  how  so  many  people  who  have  the  opportunity  to  enter 
the  kingdom  fail  to  do  so  because  of  manifest  unfitness. 
That  {hina).  Here  Mark  4:11  also  has  hina  while  Matt. 
13:13  has  hoti  (because).  On  the  so-called  causal  use  of 
hina  as  here  equal  to  hoti  see  discussion  on  Matt.  13:13  and 
Mark  4:11.  Plummer  sensibly  argues  that  there  is  truth 
both  in  the  causal  hoti  of  Matthew  and  the  final  hina  of  Mark 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  1 13 

and  Matthew.  "But  the  principle  that  he  who  hath  shall 
receive  more,  while  he  who  hath  not  shall  be  deprived  of  what 
he  seemeth  to  have,  explains  both  the  hina  and  the  hoti.  Jesus 
speaks  in  parables  because  the  multitudes  see  without  seeing 
and  hear  without  hearing.  But  He  also  speaks  in  parable 
in  order  that  they  may  see  without  seeing  and  hear  without 
hearing."  Only  for  "hearing"  Luke  has  "understand" 
suniosin,  present  subjunctive  from  a  late  omega  form  sunib 
instead  of  the  -mi  verb  suniemi. 

11.  Is  this  {estin  de  haute).  Means  this.  Jesus  now  pro- 
ceeds to  interpret  his  own  parable.  The  seed  is  the  word  of 
God  {ho  sporos  estin  ho  logos  tou  theou).  The  article  with  both 
subject  and  predicate  as  here  means  that  they  are  inter- 
changeable and  can  be  turned  round:  The  word  of  God  is 
the  seed.  The  phrase  "the  word  of  God"  does  not  appear  in 
Matthew  and  only  once  in  Mark  (7:13)  and  John  (10:35), 
but  four  times  in  Luke  (5:1;  8:11,  21;  11:28)  and  twelve 
times  in  Acts.  In  Mark  4:14  we  have  only  "the  word." 
In  Mark  3 :3i  we  have  "the  will  of  God,"  and  in  Matt.  12:46 
"the  will  of  my  Father"  where  Luke  8:21  has  "the  word  of 
God."  This  seems  to  show  that  Luke  has  the  subjective 
genitive  here  and  means  the  word  that  comes  from  God. 

12.  Those  by  the  wayside  {hoi  para  ten  hodon).  As  in  Mark 
4:i5=Matt.  19  so  here  the  people  who  hear  the  word  = 
the  seed  are  discussed  by  metonymy.  The  devil  {ho  diabolos). 
The  slanderer.  Here  Mark  4:15  has  Satan.  From  their 
heart  {apo  tes  kardias  autbn)*  Here  Mark  has  "in  them." 
It  is  the  devil's  business  to  snatch  up  the  seed  from  the  heart 
before  it  sprouts  and  takes  root.  Every  preacher  knows  how 
successful  the  devil  is  with  his  auditors.  Matt.  13:19  has  it 
"sown  in  the  heart."  That  they  may  not  believe  and  be  saved 
{hina  me  pisteusantes  sothosin).  Peculiar  to  Luke.  Negative 
purpose  with  aorist  active  participle  and  first  aorist  (in- 
gressive)  passive  subjunctive.  Many  reasons  are  offered 
today  for  the  failure  of  preachers  to  win  souls.    Here  is  the 


114      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

main  one,  the  activity  of  the  devil  during  and  after  the 
preaching  of  the  sermon.  No  wonder  then  that  the  sower 
must  have  good  seed  and  sow  wisely,  for  even  then  he  can 
only  win  partial  success. 

13.  Which  for  a  while  believe  {hoi  pros  kairon  pisteuousin) . 
Ostensibly  they  are  sincere  and  have  made  a  real  start  in 
the  life  of  faith.  They  fall  away  (aphistantai).  Present 
middle  indicative.  They  stand  off,  lose  interest,  stop  coming 
to  church,  drop  out  of  sight.  It  is  positively  amazing  the 
number  of  new  church  members  who  "stumble"  as  Mark 
4:17  has  it  (skandalizontai),  do  not  like  the  pastor,  take 
offence  at  something  said  or  done  by  somebody,  object  to 
the  appeals  for  money,  feel  slighted.  The  "season  of  trial" 
becomes  a  "season  of  temptation"  (en  kairbi  peirasmou)  for 
these  superficial,  emotional  people  who  have  to  be  periodi- 
cally rounded  up  if  kept  within  the  fold. 

14.  They  are  choked  (sunpnigontai) .  Present  passive  in- 
dicative of  this  powerfully  vivid  compound  verb  sunpnigo 
used  in  Mark  4:i9=Matt.  13:22,  only  there  these  worldly 
weeds  choke  the  word  while  here  the  victims  themselves  are 
choked.  Both  are  true.  Diphtheria  will  choke  and  strangle 
the  victim.  Who  has  not  seen  the  promise  of  fair  flower  and 
fruit  choked  into  yellow  withered  stalk  without  fruit  "as 
they  go  on  their  way"  (poreuomenoi) .  Bring  no  fruit  to 
perfection  (ou  telesphorousin).  Compound  verb  common  in 
the  late  writers  (telos,  phoreo).  To  bring  to  completion. 
Used  of  fruits,  animals,  pregnant  women.  Only  here  in  the 
N.T. 

15.  In  an  honest  and  good  heart  (en  kardiai  kalei  kai  aga- 
thei).  Peculiar  to  Luke.  In  verse  8  the  land  (gen)  is  called 
agathen  (really  good,  generous)  and  in  verse  15  we  have  en 
tei  kalei  gei  (in  the  beautiful  or  noble  land).  So  Luke  uses  both 
adjectives  of  the  heart.  The  Greeks  used  kalos  k*  agathos  of 
the  high-minded  gentleman.  It  is  probable  that  Luke  knew 
this  idiom.    It  occurs  here  alone  in  the  N.T.    It  is  not  easy 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  115 

to  translate.  We  have  such  phrases  as  "good  and  true," 
"sound  and  good,"  "right  and  good,"  no  one  of  which  quite 
suits  the  Greek.  Certainly  Luke  adds  new  moral  qualities 
not  in  the  Hellenic  phrase.  The  English  word  "honest" 
here  is  like  the  Latin  honestus  (fair,  noble).  The  words  are 
to  be  connected  with  "hold  fast"  {katechousin),  "hold  it 
down"  so  that  the  devil  does  not  snatch  it  away,  having 
depth  of  soil  so  that  it  does  not  shrivel  up  under  the  sun,  and 
is  not  choked  by  weeds  and  thorns.  It  bears  fruit  {karpo- 
phorousin,  an  old  expressive  verb,  karpos  and  phoreo).  That 
is  the  proof  of  spiritual  life.  In  patience  {en  hupomonei). 
There  is  no  other  way  for  real  fruit  to  come.  Mushrooms 
spring  up  overnight,  but  they  are  usually  poisonous.  The 
best  fruits  require  time,  cultivation,  patience. 

16.  When  he  hath  lighted  a  lamp  {luchnon  haps  as).  It  is  a 
portable  lamp  {luchnon)  that  one  lights  {hapsas  aorist  active 
participle  of  hapto,  to  kindle,  fasten  to,  light).  With  a  vessel 
{skeuei,  instrumental  case  of  skeuos).  Here  Mark  4:21  has 
the  more  definite  figure  "under  the  bushel"  as  has  Matt. 
5:15.  Under  the  bed  {hupokato  Mines).  Here  Mark  4:21  has 
the  regular  hupo  ten  klinen  instead  of  the  late  compound 
hupokato.  Ragg  notes  that  Matthew  distributes  the  sayings 
of  Jesus  given  here  by  Luke  8:16-18  =Mark  4:21-25  con- 
cerning the  parable  of  the  lamp  and  gives  them  in  three  sepa- 
rate places  (Matt.  5:15;  10:26;  13:12).  That  is  true,  but  it 
does  not  follow  that  Mark  and  Luke  have  bunched  together 
separate  sayings  or  that  Matthew  has  scattered  sayings  de- 
livered only  on  one  occasion.  One  of  the  slowest  lessons  for 
some  critics  to  learn  is  that  Jesus  repeated  favourite  sayings  on 
different  occasions  and  in  different  groupings  just  as  every 
popular  preacher  and  teacher  does  today.  See  on  Mark  4:21 
for  further  discussion  of  the  lamp  and  stand.  May  see  the 
light  {Bleposin  to  phos).  In  Matt.  5:16  Jesus  has  it  "may 
see  your  good  works."  The  purpose  of  light  is  to  let  one  see 
something  else,  not  the  light.     Note  present  subjunctive 


Il6      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

(blepdsin),  linear  action  "Jesus  had  kindled  a  light  within 
them.  They  must  not  hide  it,  but  must  see  that  it  spreads 
to  others"  (Plummer).  The  parable  of  the  lamp  throws 
light  on  the  parable  of  the  sower. 

17.  That  shall  not  be  known  (ho  ou  me  gnosthei).  Peculiar 
to  Luke.  First  aorist  passive  subjunctive  of  ginosko  with 
the  strong  double  negative  ou  me.  See  on  Mark  4:22  for 
discussion  of  krupton  and  apokruphon. 

18.  How  ye  hear  (pds  akouete).  The  manner  of  hearing. 
Mark  4:24  has  "what  ye  hear"  (ti  akouete),  the  matter  that 
is  heard.  Both  are  supremely  important.  Some  things 
should  not  be  heard  at  all.  Some  that  are  heard  should  be 
forgotten.  Others  should  be  treasured  and  practised.  For 
whosoever  hath  (Hos  an  gar  echei).  Present  active  subjunctive 
of  the  common  verb  echo  which  may  mean  "  keep  on  having" 
or  "acquiring."  See  on  Mark  4:25  for  discussion.  Thinketh 
he  hath  (dokei  echein),  or  seems  to  acquire  or  to  hold.  Losses 
in  business  illustrate  this  saying  as  when  we  see  their  riches 
take  wings  and  fly  away.  So  it  is  with  hearing  and  heeding. 
Self-deception  is  a  common  complaint. 

19.  His  mother  and  brethren  (he  meter  kai  hoi  adelphoi 
autou).  Mark  3:31-35  and  Matt.  12:46-50  place  the  visit 
of  the  mother  and  brothers  of  Jesus  before  the  parable  of  the 
sower.  Usually  Luke  follows  Mark's  order,  but  he  does  not 
do  so  here.  At  first  the  brothers  of  Jesus  (younger  sons  of 
Joseph  and  Mary,  I  take  the  words  to  mean,  there  being 
sisters  also)  were  not  unfriendly  to  the  work  of  Jesus  as  seen 
in  John  2:12  when  they  with  the  mother  of  Jesus  are  with 
him  and  the  small  group  (half  dozen)  disciples  in  Capernaum 
after  the  wedding  in  Cana.  But  as  Jesus  went  on  with  his 
work  and  was  rejected  at  Nazareth  (Luke  4:16-31),  there 
developed  an  evident  disbelief  in  his  claims  on  the  part  of 
the  brothers  who  ridiculed  him  six  months  before  the  end 
(John  7:5).  At  this  stage  they  have  apparently  come  with 
Mary  to  take  Jesus  home  out  of  the  excitement  of  the  crowds, 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  117 

perhaps  thinking  that  he  is  beside  himself  (Mark  3:21). 
They  hardly  believed  the  charge  of  the  rabbis  that  Jesus 
was  in  league  with  Beelzebub.  Certainly  the  mother  of 
Jesus  could  give  no  credence  to  that  slander.  But  she  her- 
self was  deeply  concerned  and  wanted  to  help  him  if  possible. 
See  discussion  of  the  problem  in  my  little  book  The  Mother 
of  Jesus  and  also  on  Mark  3:31  and  Matt.  12:46.  Come  to 
him  {suntuchein) .  Second  aorist  active  infinitive  of  sun- 
tugchano,  an  old  verb,  though  here  alone  in  the  N.T.,  mean- 
ing to  meet  with,  to  fall  in  with  as  if  accidentally,  here  with 
associative  instrumental  case  autoi. 

20.  Was  told  {apeggele).  Second  aorist  passive  indicative 
of  apaggello,  to  bring  word  or  tidings.  Common  verb.  See 
on  Mark  3:32  and  Matt.  12:47  for  details. 

21.  These  which  hear  the  word  of  God  and  do  it  {hoi  ton 
logon  tou  theou  akouontes  kai  poiountes).  The  absence  of  the 
article  with  "mother"  and  "brothers"  probably  means,  as 
Plummer  argues,  "Mother  to  me  and  brothers  to  me  are 
those  who  &c."  No  one  is  a  child  of  God  because  of  human 
parentage  (John  1:13).  "Family  ties  are  at  best  temporal; 
spiritual  ties  are  eternal"  (Plummer).  Note  the  use  of 
"hear  and  do"  together  here  as  in  Matt.  7:24  =  Luke  6:47 
at  the  close  of  the  Sermon  on  the  Mount.  The  parable  of 
the  sower  is  almost  like  a  footnote  to  that  sermon.  Later 
Jesus  will  make  "doing"  a  test  of  friendship  for  him  (John 

22.  And  they  launched  forth  {kai  anechthesan).  First  aorist 
passive  indicative  of  anago,  an  old  verb,  to  lead  up,  to  put 
out  to  sea  (looked  at  as  going  up  from  the  land).  This  nau- 
tical sense  of  the  verb  occurs  only  in  Luke  in  the  N.T.  and 
especially  in  the  Acts  (13:13;  16:11;  18:21;  20:3,  13;  21:1,  2; 
27:2,  4,  12,  21;  28:101.). 

23.  He  fell  asleep  {aphupnosen).  First  aorist  (ingressive) 
active  indicative  of  aphupnoo,  to  put  to  sleep,  to  fall  off  to 
sleep,  a  late  verb  for  which  the  older  Greek  used  kathupnoo. 


Il8      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Originally  aphupnoo  meant  to  waken  from  sleep,  then  to  fall 
off  to  sleep  (possibly  a  medical  use).  This  is  the  only  passage 
which  speaks  of  the  sleep  of  Jesus.  Here  only  in  the  N.T. 
Came  down  (katebe).  Second  aorist  active  indicative  of 
katabaino,  common  verb.  It  was  literally  true.  These  wind 
storms  (lailaps.  So  also  Mark  4:37)  rushed  from  Hermon 
down  through  the  Jordan  gorge  upon  the  Sea  of  Galilee  and 
shook  it  like  a  tempest  (Matt.  8:24).  Mark's  (4:37)  vivid 
use  of  the  dramatic  present  ginetai  (ariseth)  is  not  so  precise 
as  Luke's  "came  down."  See  on  Matt.  8:24.  These  sudden 
squalls  were  dangerous  on  this  small  lake.  They  were  filling 
(suneplerounto).  Imperfect  passive.  It  was  the  boat  that 
was  being  filled  (Mark  4:37)  and  it  is  here  applied  to  the 
navigators  as  sailors  sometimes  spoke.  An  old  verb,  but  in 
the  N.T.  used  only  by  Luke  (8:23;  9:51;  Acts  2:1).  Were  in 
jeopardy  (ekinduneuon).  Imperfect  active,  vivid  descrip- 
tion. Old  verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here,  Acts  19:27; 
I  Cor.  15:30. 

24.  Master,  Master  (Epistata,  epistata).  See  on  Luke  5:5 
for  discussion.  Mark  4:38  has  Teacher  (Didaskale),  Matt. 
8:25  has  Lord  (Kurie).  The  repetition  here  shows  the  un- 
easiness of  the  disciples.  We  perish  (apollumetha) .  So  in 
Mark  4:38  and  Matt.  8:25.  Linear  present  middle  indica- 
tive, we  are  perishing.  The  raging  of  the  water  (toi  kludoni 
tou  hudatos).  Kludon,  common  Greek  word,  is  a  boisterous 
surge,  a  violent  agitation.  Here  only  in  the  N.T.  save  James 
1:6.  Kuma  (Mark  4:37)  is  the  regular  swell  or  wave.  A 
calm  (galene).  Only  in  the  parallels  in  the  N.T.,  though 
common  word.  Here  Mark  4:39  and  Matt.  8:26  add  great 
(megale).  That  (hoti).  This  use  of  hoti  as  explanatory  of  the 
demonstrative  pronoun  houtos  occurs  in  the  parallels  Mark 
4:36  =  Matt.  8 :27  and  also  in  Luke  4 136.  It  is  almost  result. 
He  commandeth  (epitassei).    Peculiar  to  Luke. 

26.  They  arrived  (katepleusan).  First  aorist  active  indica- 
tive of  katapleo,  common  verb,  but  here  only  in  the  N.T. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  119 

Literally,  they  sailed  down  from  the  sea  to  the  land,  the  op- 
posite of  launched  forth  (anechthesan)  of  verse  22.  So 
we  today  use  like  nautical  terms,  to  bear  up,  to  bear  down. 
The  Gerasenes  (ton  Gerasenon).  This  is  the  correct  text  here 
as  in  Mark  5:1  while  Gadarenes  is  correct  in  Matt.  8:28. 
See  there  for  explanation  of  this  famous  discrepancy,  now 
cleared  up  by  Thomson's  discovery  of  Khersa  (Gersa)  on  the 
steep  eastern  bank  and  in  the  vicinity  of  Gadara.  Over 
against  Galilee  (antipera  tes  Galilaias).  Only  here  in  the 
N.T.  The  later  Greek  form  is  antiperan  (Polybius,  etc.). 
Some  MSS.  here  have  per  an  like  Mark  5:1  =Matt.  8:28. 

27.  And  for  a  long  time  (kai  chronoi  hikanoi).  The  use  of 
the  associative  instrumental  case  in  expressions  of  time  is  a 
very  old  Greek  idiom  that  still  appears  in  the  papyri  (Robert- 
son, Grammar,  p.  527).  He  had  worn  no  clothes  (ouk  enedusato 
himation).  First  aorist  middle  indicative,  constative  aorist, 
viewing  the  "long  time"  as  a  point.  Not  pluperfect  as 
English  has  it  and  not  for  the  pluperfect,  simply  "and  for 
a  long  time  he  did  not  put  on  himself  (indirect  middle)  any 
clothing."  The  physician  would  naturally  note  this  item. 
Common  verb  enduo  or  enduno.  This  item  in  Luke  alone, 
though  implied  by  Mark  5:15  "clothed"  (himatismenon) . 
And  abode  not  in  any  house  (kai  en  oikiai  ouk  emenen).  Im- 
perfect active.  Peculiar  to  Luke,  though  implied  by  the 
mention  of  tombs  in  all  three  (Mark  5 :3  =  Matt.  8 :28  == 
Luke  8:27). 

28.  Fell  down  (prosepesen).  Second  aorist  active  of 
prospipto,  to  fall  forward,  towards,  prostrate  before  one  as 
here.  Common  verb.  Mark  5:6  has  prosekunesen  (wor- 
shipped). The  Most  High  God  (tou  theou  tou  hupsistou). 
Uncertain  whether  tou  theou  genuine  or  not.  But  "the 
Most  High"  clearly  means  God  as  already  seen  (Luke  1:32, 
35,  36;  6:35).  The  phrase  is  common  among  heathen  (Num. 
24:16;  Micah.  6:6;  Isa.  14:14).  The  demoniac  may  have  been 
a  Gentile,  but  it  is  the  demon  here  speaking.    See  on  Mark 


120      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

2:7  =  Matt.  8:29  for  the  Greek  idiom  (ti  emoi  kai  sot). 
"  What  have  I  to  do  with  thee?"  See  there  also  for  "Tor- 
ment me  not. " 

29.  For  he  commanded  (pareggellen  gar).  Imperfect  ac- 
tive, correct  text,  for  he  was  commanding.  Oftentimes 
(pollois  chronois).  Or  "for  a  long  time"  like  chronbi  pollbi 
of  verse  27  (see  Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  537,  for  the  plural 
here).  It  had  seized  (sunerpakei).  Past  perfect  active  of 
sunarpazb,  to  lay  hold  by  force.  An  old  verb,  but  only  in 
Luke  in  the  N.T.  (Luke  8:29;  Acts  6:12;  19:29;  27:15). 
Was  kept  under  guard  (edesmeueto).  Imperfect  passive  of 
desmeuo  to  put  in  chains,  from  desmos,  bond,  and  that  from 
deb  to  bind.  Old,  but  rather  rare  verb.  Only  here  and  Acts 
22:4  in  this  sense.  In  Matt.  23  14  it  means  to  bind  together. 
Some  MSS.  read  desmeb  in  Luke  8:29.  Breaking  the  bands 
asunder  (diaressbn  ta  desmd).  Old  verb,  the  preposition  dia 
(in  two)  intensifying  the  meaning  of  the  simple  verb  ressb 
or  regnumi,  to  rend.  Was  driven  (elauneto).  Imperfect  pas- 
sive of  elaunb,  to  drive,  to  row,  to  march  (Xenophon). 
Only  five  times  in  the  N.T.  Here  alone  in  Luke  and  pecul- 
iar to  Luke  in  this  incident. 

30.  Legion  (Legion).    See  on  Mark  5:9. 

31.  Into  the  abyss  (eis  ten  abusson).  Rare  old  word  com- 
mon in  LXX  from  a  privative  and  bathus  (deep).  So  bot- 
tomless place  (supply  chord).  The  deep  sea  in  Gen.  1:2; 
7:11.  The  common  receptacle  of  the  dead  in  Rom.  10:7 
and  especially  the  abode  of  demons  as  here  and  Rev.  9:1-11; 
11:7;  17:8;  20:1,  3. 

32.  A  herd  of  many  swine  (agele  choirbn  hikanbn).  Word 
herd  (agele)  old  as  Homer,  but  in  N.T.  only  here  and  parallels 
(Mark  5:ii=Matt.  8:30).  Luke  shows  his  fondness  for 
adjective  hikanos  here  again  (see  verse  27)  where  Mark  has 
megale  and  Matthew  pollbn. 

33.  Rushed  down  the  steep  (hbrmesen  kata  tou  kremnou). 
Ablative  with  kata  as  in  Mark  5:13  and  Matt.  8:32  and  the 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  121 

same  vivid  verb  in  each  account,  to  hurl  impetuously,  to 
rush.  Were  choked  (apepnige).  Second  aorist  (constative) 
passive  indicative  third  singular  (collective  singular)  where 
Mark  5:13  has  the  picturesque  imperfect  epnigonto. 

34.  Saw  what  had  come  to  pass  (idontes  to  gegonos).  This 
item  only  in  Luke.  Note  the  neat  Greek  idiom  to  gegonos, 
articular  second  perfect  active  participle  of  ginomai.  Re- 
peated in  verse  35  and  in  Mark  5:14.  Note  numerous 
participles  here  in  verse  35  as  in  Mark  5:15. 

36.  He  that  was  possessed  with  devils  {demons)  (only  two 
words  in  Greek,  ho  daimonistheis,  the  demonized).  Was 
made  whole  (esbthe).  First  aorist  passive  indicative  of  sozo  to 
save  from  sos  (safe  and  sound).  This  is  additional  informa- 
tion to  the  news  carried  to  them  in  verse  34. 

37.  Were  holden  with  great  fear  (phoboi  megalbi  suneichonto). 
Imperfect  passive  of  sunechb  with  the  instrumental  case  of 
phobos.  See  a  similar  use  of  this  vigorous  verb  in  Luke 
12:50  of  Jesus  and  in  Phil.  1 :23  of  Paul. 

38.  From  whom  the  devils  (demons)  were  gone  out  iapK  hou 
exeleluthei  ta  daimonia).  Past  perfect  active  of  exerchomai, 
state  of  completion  in  the  past.  Prayed  him  (edeeito  autou). 
Imperfect  middle,  kept  on  begging. 

39.  Throughout  the  whole  city  (kath'  holen  ten  polin). 
Mark  5:20  has  it  "in  Decapolis."  He  had  a  great  story  to 
tell  and  he  told  it  with  power.  The  rescue  missions  in  our 
cities  can  match  this  incident  with  cases  of  great  sinners 
who  have  made  witnesses  for  Christ. 

40.  Welcomed  (apedexato).  Peculiar  to  Luke.  To  re- 
ceive with  pleasure,  from  apodechomai,  a  common  verb.  For 
they  were  all  waiting  for  him  (esan  gar  pantes  prosdokontes 
auton).  Periphrastic  imperfect  active  of  prosdokao,  an 
old  verb  for  eager  expectancy,  a  vivid  picture  of  the  attitude 
of  the  people  towards  Jesus.  Driven  from  Decapolis,  he 
is  welcomed  in  Capernaum. 

41.  Was  (huperchen).     Imperfect  of  huparcho  in  sense  of 


122      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

en  as  in  modern  Greek.     Common  in  Luke,  and  Acts,  but 
not  in  other  Gospels. 

42.  An  only  daughter  {thugaier  monogenes).  The  same 
adjective  used  of  the  widow's  son  (7:12)  and  the  epileptic 
boy  (9:38)  and  of  Jesus  (John  1:18;  3:16).  She  lay  a  dying 
(apethnesken).  Imperfect  active,  she  was  dying.  Matt. 
9:18  has  it  that  she  has  just  died.  Thronged  (sunepnigon). 
Imperfect  active  of  sumpnigo,  to  press  together,  the  verb 
used  of  the  thorns  choking  the  growing  grain  (Luke  8:14). 
It  was  a  jam. 

43.  Had  spent  all  her  living  upon  physicians  (eis  iatrous 
prosanalosasa  holon  ton  bion).  First  aorist  active  participle 
of  an  old  verb  prosanalisko,  only  here  in  the  N.T.  But 
Westcott  and  Hort  reject  this  clause  because  it  is  not  in 
B  D  Syriac  Sinaitic.  Whether  genuine  or  not,  the  other 
clause  in  Mark  5:26  certainly  is  not  in  Luke:  "had  suffered 
many  things  of  many  physicians."  Probably  both  are  not 
genuine  in  Luke  who  takes  care  of  the  physicians  by  the 
simple  statement  that  it  was  a  chronic  case:  could  not  be 
healed  of  any  (ouk  ischusen  ap*  oudenos  therapeuthenai). 
He  omitted  also  what  Mark  has:  "and  was  nothing  bet- 
tered but  rather  grew  worse. " 

44.  The  border  of  his  garment  (tou  kraspedou  tou  himatiou). 
Probably  the  tassel  of  the  overgarment.  Of  the  four  corners 
two  were  in  front  and  two  behind.  See  on  Matt.  9:20. 
Stanched  (este).  Second  aorist  active  indicative,  stopped 
at  once  (effective  aorist). 

45.  Press  thee  and  crush  thee  (sunechousin  se  kai  apothli- 
bousin).  Hold  thee  together,  hold  thee  in  (sunecho,  see  verse 
37).  Crush  thee  (apothlibo)  here  only  in  the  N.T.,  a  verb 
used  of  pressing  out  grapes  in  Diodorus  and  Josephus. 
Mark  5:31  has  sunthlibo,  to  press  together. 

46.  For  I  perceived  that  power  had  gone  forth  from  me  {ego 
gar  egnon  dunamin  exeleluthuian  ap^  emou).  Egnbn  is  second 
aorist  active  indicative  of  ginosko,  knowledge  by  personal 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  123 

experience  as  here.  It  is  followed  by  the  second  perfect  ac- 
tive participle  exeleluthuian  in  indirect  discourse  (Robert- 
son, Grammar,  pp.  1040-42).  Jesus  felt  the  sensation  of 
power  already  gone.  Who  does  not  know  what  this  sense  of 
"goneness"  or  exhaustion  of  nervous  energy  means? 

47.  Trembling  (tremousa).  Vivid  touch  of  the  feeling  of 
this  sensitive  woman  who  now  had  to  tell  everybody  of  her 
cure,  "in  the  presence  of  all  the  people"  (enopion  pantos  tou 
laou).    She  faced  the  widest  publicity  for  her  secret  cure. 

49.  From  the  ruler  of  the  synagogue's  house  (para  tou 
archisunagogou).  The  word  "house"  is  not  in  the  Greek 
here  as  in  Mark  5:35  where  apo  is  used  rather  than  para,  as 
here.  But  the  ruler  himself  had  come  to  Jesus  (Luke  8:41) 
and  this  is  the  real  idea.  Trouble  not  (meketi  skulle).  See 
on  Luke  7:6  for  this  verb  and  also  Mark  5:35  and  Matt  9:36. 

50.  And  she  shall  be  made  whole  (kai  sothesetai).  This 
promise  in  addition  to  the  words  in  Mark  5:36.  See  there 
for  discussion  of  details. 

53.  Knowing  that  she  was  dead  (eidotes  hoti  apethanen). 
That  she  died  {apethanen),  second  aorist  active  indicative 
of  apothnesko. 

54.  Called  (ephonesen) .  Certainly  not  to  wake  up  the  dead, 
but  to  make  it  plain  to  all  that  she  rose  in  response  to  his 
elevated  tone  of  voice.  Some  think  that  the  remark  of 
Jesus  in  verse  52  (  =  Mark  5 139  =  Matt.  9:24)  proves  that 
she  was  not  really  dead,  but  only  in  a  trance.  It  matters 
little.  The  touch  of  Christ's  hand  and  the  power  of  his  voice 
restored  her  to  life.  Maiden  (he  pais)  rather  than  Mark's 
(5:41)  to  korasion  (vernacular  Koine). 

55.  Her  spirit  returned  (epe  strep  sen  to  pneuma  autes).  The 
life  came  back  to  her  at  once.  Be  given  her  to  eat  (autei 
dothenai  phagein).  The  first  infinitive  dothenai  is  an  in- 
direct command.  The  second  phagein  (second  aorist  active 
of  esthio)  is  epexegetic  purpose. 


CHAPTER  IX 

1.  He  called  the  twelve  together  (sunkalesamenos  tous  do- 
deka).  Mark  6:7  and  Matt.  10:1  have  proskaleomai,  to  call 
to  him.    Both  the  indirect  middle  voice. 

2.  He  sent  them  forth  (apesteilen  autous).  First  aorist 
active  indicative  of  apostellb.  To  preach  the  kingdom  of  God 
and  to  heal  the  sick  (kerussein  ten  basileian  tou  theou  kai  ids- 
thai).  Present  indicative  for  the  continuous  functions  during 
this  campaign.  This  double  office  of  herald  (kerussein)  and 
healer  (idsthai)  is  stated  directly  in  Matt.  10:7-8.  Note 
the  verb  iaomai  for  healing  here,  though  therapeuein  in  verse 
I,  apparently  used  interchangeably. 

3.  Neither  staff  (mete  rabdon).  For  the  apparent  contra- 
diction between  these  words  ( =  Matt.  10:10)  and  Mark  6:8 
see  discussion  there.  For  per  an  (wallet)  see  also  on  Mark  6:8 
(  =  Matt.  10:10)  for  this  and  other  details  here. 

5.  As  many  as  receive  you  not  (hosoi  an  me  dechontai  humas). 
Indefinite  relative  plural  with  an  and  present  middle  sub- 
junctive and  the  negative  me.  Here  Matt.  10:14  has  the 
singular  (whosoever)  and  Mark  6:11  has  "whatsoever 
place."  For  a  testimony  against  them  (eis  marturion  ep* 
autous).  Note  use  of  ep'  autous  where  Mark  6:11  has  simply 
the  dative  autois  (disadvantage),  really  the  same  idea. 

6.  Went  (dierchonto) .  Imperfect  middle,  continuous  and 
repeated  action  made  plainer  also  by  three  present  parti- 
ciples (exerchomenoi,  euaggelizomenoi,  therapeuontes),  describ- 
ing the  wide  extent  of  the  work  through  all  the  villages  (kata 
las  komas,  distributive  use  of  kata)  everywhere  (pantachou) 
in  Galilee. 

7.  All  that  was  done  (ta  ginomena  panta).  Present  middle 
participle,  "all  that  was  coming  to  pass."     He  was  much 

124 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  125 

perplexed  {dieporei).  Imperfect  active  of  diaporeo,  to  be 
thoroughly  at  a  loss,  unable  to  find  a  way  out  (dia,  a  priva- 
tive, porojy  way),  common  ancient  verb,  but  only  in  Luke's 
writings  in  the  N.T.  Because  it  was  said  {dia  to  legesthai). 
Neat  Greek  idiom,  the  articular  passive  infinitive  after  dia. 
Three  reports  came  to  the  ears  of  Herod  as  Luke  has  it,  each 
introduced  by  hoti  (that)  in  indirect  discourse:  "By  some" 
(hupo  tinon),  "by  some"  (hupo  tinon  de),  "by  others" 
(allon  de,  hupo  not  here  expressed,  but  carried  over).  The 
verbs  in  the  indirect  discourse  here  (verses  7  and  8)  are  all 
three  aorists  (egerthe  first  passive;  ephane  second  passive; 
aneste  second  active),  not  past  perfects  as  the  English  has 
them. 

9.  He  sought  (ezetei).  Imperfect  active.  He  keep  on  seek- 
ing to  see  Jesus.  The  rumours  disturbed  Herod  because  he 
was  sure  that  he  had  put  him  to  death  ("John  I  beheaded"). 

10.  Declared  (diegesanto).  First  aorist  middle  of  diegeomai, 
to  carry  a  narrative  through  to  the  end.  Jesus  listened  to  it 
all.  They  had  done  (epoiesan).  Aorist  active  indicative,  they 
did.  He  took  them  (paralabbn  autous).  Second  aorist  active 
participle  of  paralambano.  Very  common  verb.  Bethsaida 
(Bethsaida).  Peculiar  to  Luke.  Bethsaida  Julias  is  the  terri- 
tory of  Philip,  for  it  is  on  the  other  side  of  the  Sea  of 
Galilee  (John  6:1). 

11.  Spake  (elalei).  Imperfect  active,  he  continued  speak- 
ing. He  healed  (iato).  Imperfect  middle,  he  continued 
healing. 

12.  To  wear  away  (klinein).  Old  verb  usually  transitive, 
to  bend  or  bow  down.  Many  compounds  as  in  English 
decline,  incline,  recline,  clinic  (kline,  bed),  etc.  Luke  alone 
in  the  N.T.  uses  it  intransitively  as  here.  The  sun  was  turn- 
ing down  towards  setting.  Lodge  (katalusosin) .  First  aorist 
active  subjunctive  of  kataluo,  a  common  verb,  to  dissolve, 
destroy,  overthrow,  and  then  of  travellers  to  break  a  journey,

in  the  N.T.  in  this  sense.  Get  victuals  {heurbsin  episitismon). 
Ingressive  aorist  active  of  heuriskb,  very  common  verb. 
Victuals  (episitismon,  from  episitizomai,  to  provision  one- 
self, sitizb,  from  siton,  wheat)  only  here  in  the  N.T.,  though 
common  in  ancient  Greek,  especially  for  provisions  for  a 
journey  (snack).  See  on  Mark  6:32-44  =  Matt.  14:13-21  for 
discussion  of  details. 

13.  Except  we  should  go  and  buy  food  (ei  meti  poreuthentes 
hemeis  agorasbmen  brbmata).  This  is  a  condition  of  the  third 
class  with  the  aorist  subjunctive  (agorasbmen),  where  the 
conjunction  is  usually  ean  (with  negative  ean  me),  but  not 
always  or  necessarily  so  especially  in  the  Koine.  So  in  I  Cor. 
14:5  ei  me  diermeneuei  and  in  Phil.  3:12  ei  kai  katalabb. 
"Unless"  is  better  here  than  "except."  Food  (brbmata), 
means  eaten  pieces  from  bibrbskb,  to  eat,  somewhat  like  our 
"edibles"  or  vernacular  "eats." 

14.  About  (hbsei).  Luke  as  Matt.  14:21  adds  this  word  to 
the  definite  statement  of  Mark  6:44  that  there  were  5,000 
men,  a  hundred  companies  of  fifty  each.  Sit  down  (katakli- 
nate).  First  aorist  active  imperative.  Recline,  lie  down. 
Only  in  Luke  in  the  N.T.  See  also  verse  15.  In  companies 
(klisias).  Cognate  accusative  after  kataklinate.  Only  here  in 
the  N.T.  A  row  of  persons  reclining  at  meals  (table  com- 
pany). About  fifty  each  (hbsei  ana  pentekonta).  Distributive 
use  of  ana  and  approximate  number  again  (hbsei). 

16.  The  five  .  .  .  the two  (tous  pente  .  .  .  tousduo).  Point- 
ing back  to  verse  13,  fine  example  of  the  Greek  article.  And 
gave  (kai  edidou).  Imperfect  active  of  didbmi,  kept  on  giving. 
This  picturesque  imperfect  is  preceded  by  the  aorist  kate- 
klasen  (brake),  a  single  act.  This  latter  verb  in  the  N.T. 
only  here  and  the  parallel  in  Mark  6:41,  though  common 
enough  in  ancient  Greek.  We  say  "break  off"  where  here 
the  Greek  has  "break  down"  (or  thoroughly),  perfective  use 
of  kata. 

17.  Twelve  baskets  (kophinoi  dbdeka).     For  discussion  of

kophonoi  and  sphurides  as  well  as  of  klasmata  (broken  pieces) 
see  on  Mark  6:43  =  Matt.  14:20. 

18.  As  he  was  praying  {en  toi  einai  auton  proseuchomenon). 
Common  Lukan  idiom  of  en  with  the  articular  infinitive  for 
a  temporal  clause,  only  here  Luke  has  the  periphrastic 
infinitive  {einai  proseuchomenon)  as  also  in  11  :i.  This  item 
about  Christ's  praying  alone  in  Luke.  Alone  {kata  monas). 
In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Mark  4:10.  Perhaps  choras 
(places)  is  to  be  supplied  with  monas  (lonely  places).  Were 
with  him  {sunesan  autbi).  This  seems  like  a  contradiction 
unless  "alone"  is  to  be  taken  with  sunesan.  Westcott  and 
Hort  put  sunentesan  in  the  margin.  This  would  mean  that  as 
Jesus  was  praying  alone,  the  disciples  fell  in  with  him.  At 
any  rate  he  was  praying  apart  from  them. 

19.  That  I  am  {me  einai).  Accusative  and  infinitive  in 
indirect  assertion,  a  common  Greek  idiom.  Matt.  16:13 
for  "I"  has  "the  Son  of  man"  as  identical  in  the  conscious- 
ness of  Christ.  The  various  opinions  of  men  about  Jesus 
here  run  parallel  to  the  rumours  heard  by  Herod  (verses  8 
and  9). 

20.  But  who  say  ye?  {Humeis  de  tina  legete;).  Note  the 
emphatic  proleptical  position  of  humeis:  "But  ye  who  do  ye 
say?  This  is  really  what  mattered  now  with  Jesus.  The 
Christ  of  God  {Ton  christon  tou  theou).  The  accusative 
though  the  infinitive  is  not  expressed.  The  Anointed  of 
God,  the  Messiah  of  God.  See  on  2:26  for  "the  Anointed  of 
the  Lord."  See  on  Matt.  16:17  f°r  discussion  of  Peter's 
testimony  in  full.  Mark  6 129  has  simply  "the  Christ. "  It  is 
clear  from  the  previous  narrative  that  this  is  not  a  new  dis- 
covery from  Simon  Peter,  but  simply  the  settled  conviction 
of  the  disciples  after  all  the  defections  of  the  Galilean  masses 
and  the  hostility  of  the  Jerusalem  ecclesiastics.  The  disciples 
still  believed  in  Jesus  as  the  Messiah  of  Jewish  hope  and 
prophecy.  It  will  become  plain  that  they  do  not  grasp  the 
spiritual  conception  of  the  Messiah  and  his  kingdom  that 


128      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Jesus  taught,  but  they  are  clear  that  he  is  the  Messiah  how- 
ever faulty  their  view  of  the  Messiah  may  be.  There  was 
comfort  in  this  for  Jesus.     They  were  loyal  to  him. 

21.  To  tell  this  to  no  man  (medeni  legein  touto).  Indirect 
command  with  the  negative  infinitive  after  commanded 
(pareggeilen).  It  had  been  necessary  for  Jesus  to  cease  using 
the  word  Messiah  (Christos)  about  himself  because  of  the 
political  meaning  to  the  Jews.  Its  use  by  the  disciples  would 
lead  to  revolution  as  was  plain  after  the  feeding  of  the  five 
thousand  (John  6:15). 

22.  Rejected  (apodokimasthenai) .  First  aorist  passive  in- 
finitive of  apodokimazo,  to  reject  after  trial.  The  third  day 
(tei  trifei  hemerai).  Locative  case  of  time  as  in  Matt.  16:21. 
Here  in  the  parallel  passage  Mark  8:31  has  "after  three  days" 
(meta  treis  hemeras)  in  precisely  the  same  sense.  That  is  to 
say,  "after  three  days"  is  just  a  free  way  of  saying  "on  the 
third  day"  and  cannot  mean  "on  the  fourth  day"  if  taken 
too  literally.  For  discussion  of  this  plain  prediction  of  the 
death  of  Christ  with  various  details  see  discussion  on  Matt. 
16:21  =Mark  8:31.  It  was  a  melancholy  outlook  that  de- 
pressed the  disciples  as  Mark  and  Matthew  show  in  the 
protest  of  Peter  and  his  rebuke. 

23.  He  said  unto  all  (elegen  de  pros  pantas).  This  is  like 
Luke  (cf.  verse  43).  Jesus  wanted  all  (the  multitude  with  his 
disciples,  as  Mark  8:34  has  it)  to  understand  the  lesson  of 
self-sacrifice.  They  could  not  yet  understand  the  full  mean- 
ing of  Christ's  words  as  applied  to  his  approaching  death  of 
which  he  had  been  speaking.  But  certainly  the  shadow  of 
the  cross  is  already  across  the  path  of  Jesus  as  he  is  here 
speaking.  For  details  (soul,  life,  forfeit,  gain,  profit,  lose, 
world)  see  discussion  on  Matt.  16:24-26  =  Mark  8:34-37. 
The  word  for  lose  (apolesei,  from  apollumi,  a  very  common 
verb)  is  used  in  the  sense  of  destroy,  kill,  lose,  as  here.  Note 
the  mercantile  terms  in  this  passage  (gain,  lose,  fine  or  for- 
feit, exchange).     Daily  {kath>  hemeran).     Peculiar  to  Luke 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  129 

in  this  incident.  Take  up  the  cross  (his  own  cross)  daily 
(aorist  tense,  arato),  but  keep  on  following  me  (akoloutheito, 
present  tense).  The  cross  was  a  familiar  figure  in  Palestine. 
It  was  rising  before  Jesus  as  his  destiny.  Each  man  has  his 
own  cross  to  meet  and  bear. 

26.  Whosoever  shall  be  ashamed  (hos  an  epaischunthei). 
Rather,  Whosoever  is  ashamed  as  in  Mark  8:38.  The  first 
aorist  passive  subjunctive  in  an  indefinite  relative  clause 
with  an.  The  passive  verb  is  transitive  here  also.  This  verb 
is  from  epi  and  aischune,  shame  (in  the  eyes  of  men).  Jesus 
endured  the  shame  of  the  cross  (Heb.  12:2).  The  man  at 
the  feast  who  had  to  take  a  lower  seat  did  it  with  shame 
(Luke  14:9).  Paul  is  not  ashamed  of  the  Gospel  (Rom. 
1  :i6).  Onesiphorus  was  not  ashamed  of  Paul  (II  Tim.  1  :i6). 
In  his  own  glory  {en  tei  doxei  autou).  This  item  added  to  what 
is  in  Mark  8 138  =  Matt.  16:27. 

27.  Till  they  see  {heos  an  idosin).  Second  aorist  active 
subjunctive  with  heos  and  an  referring  to  the  future,  an 
idiomatic  construction.  So  in  Mark  9:1  =  Matt.  16:28.  In 
all  three  passages  "shall  not  taste  of  death"  (ou  me  geusbntai 
thanatou,  double  negative  with  aorist  middle  subjunctive) 
occurs  also.  Rabbinical  writings  use  this  figure.  Like  a 
physician  Christ  tasted  death  that  we  may  see  how  to  die. 
Jesus  referred  to  the  cross  as  "this  cup"  (Mark  14:36  = 
Matt.  26:39  =  Luke  22:42).  Mark  speaks  of  the  kingdom  of 
God  as  "come"  {eleluthuian,  second  perfect  active  participle). 
Matthew  as  "coming"  {erchomenon)  referring  to  the  Son  of 
man,  while  Luke  has  neither  form.  See  Matthew  and  Mark 
for  discussion  of  the  theories  of  interpretation  of  this  difficult 
passage.  The  Transfiguration  follows  in  a  week  and  may  be 
the  first  fulfilment  in  the  mind  of  Jesus.  It  may  also  sym- 
bolically point  to  the  second  coming. 

28.  About  eight  days  (hosei  hemerai  okto).  A  nominations 
pendens  without  connexion  or  construction.  Mark  9:2 
(  =  Matt.  17:1)  has  "after  six  days"  which  agrees  with  the 


130      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

general  statement.  Into  the  mountain  (eis  to  or os).  Probably 
Mount  Hermon  because  we  know  that  Jesus  was  near 
Caesarea  Philippi  when  Peter  made  the  confession  (Mark 
8:27=Matt.  16:13).  Hermon  is  still  the  glory  of  Palestine 
from  whose  heights  one  can  view  the  whole  of  the  land.  It 
was  a  fit  place  for  the  Transfiguration.  To  pray  (proseuxas- 
thai).  Peculiar  to  Luke  who  so  often  mentions  Christ's  habit 
of  prayer  (cf.  3:21).  See  also  verse  29  "as  he  was  praying" 
(en  tbi  proseuchesthai,  one  of  Luke's  favourite  idioms).  His 
countenance  was  altered  (egeneto  to  eidos  tou  prosbpou  autou 
heteron).  Literally,  "the  appearance  of  his  face  became 
different."  Matt.  17:2  says  that  "his  face  did  shine  as  the 
sun."  Luke  does  not  use  the  word  "transfigured"  (mete- 
morphbthe)  in  Mark  9:2  =Matt.  17:2.  He  may  have  avoided 
this  word  because  of  the  pagan  associations  with  this  word 
as  Ovid's  Metamorphoses.  And  his  raiment  became  white 
and  dazzling  (kai  ho  himatismos  autou  leukos  exastraptbn). 
Literally,  And  his  raiment  white  radiant.  There  is  no 
and  between  "white"  and  "dazzling."  The  participle 
exastraptbn  is  from  the  compound  verb  meaning  to  flash 
(astraptb)  out  or  forth  (ex).  The  simple  verb  is  common  for 
lightning  flashes  and  bolts,  but  the  compound  in  the  LXX 
and  here  alone  in  the  N.T.  See  Mark  9 -.3  "exceeding  white " 
and  Matt.  17:2  "white  as  the  light." 

31.  There  talked  with  him  (sunelaloun  autbi).  Imperfect 
active,  were  talking  with  him.  Who  appeared  in  glory  (hoi 
ophthentes  en  doxei).  First  aorist  passive  participle  of 
horab.  This  item  peculiar  to  Luke.  Compare  verse  26. 
Spake  of  his  decease  (elegon  ten  exodon).  Imperfect  active, 
were  talking  about  his  exodus  (departure  from  earth  to 
heaven)  very  much  like  our  English  word  "decease"  (Latin 
decessus,  a  going  away).  The  glorious  light  graphically 
revealed  Moses  and  Elijah  talking  with  Jesus  about  the 
very  subject  concerning  which  Peter  had  dared  to  rebuke 
Jesus  for  mentioning  (Mark  8:32  =  Matt.  16:22).    This  very 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  13 1 

word  exodus  (way  out)  in  the  sense  of  death  occurs  in  II  Pet. 
1:15  and  is  followed  by  a  brief  description  of  the  Transfigura- 
tion glory.  Other  words  for  death  (thanatos)  in  the  N.T. 
are  ekbasis,  going  out  as  departure  (Heb.  13:7),  aphixis, 
departing  (Acts  20:29),  analusis,  loosening  anchor  (II  Tim. 
4:6)  and  analusai  (Phil.  1:23).  To  accomplish  (pleroun). 
To  fulfil.  Moses  had  led  the  Exodus  from  Egypt.  Jesus 
will  accomplish  the  exodus  of  God's  people  into  the  Promised 
Land  on  high.  See  on  Mark  and  Matthew  for  discussion  of 
significance  of  the  appearance  of  Moses  and  Elijah  as  rep- 
resentatives of  law  and  prophecy  and  with  a  peculiar  death. 
The  purpose  of  the  Transfiguration  was  to  strengthen  the 
heart  of  Jesus  as  he  was  praying  long  about  his  approach- 
ing death  and  to  give  these  chosen  three  disciples  a  glimpse 
of  his  glory  for  the  hour  of  darkness  coming.  No  one  on 
earth  understood  the  heart  of  Jesus  and  so  Moses  and 
Elijah  came.  The  poor  disciples  utterly  failed  to  grasp  the 
significance  of  it  all. 

32.  Were  heavy  with  sleep  (esan  bebaremenoi  hupnoi). 
Periphrastic  past  perfect  of  bared,  a  late  form  for  the  ancient 
baruno  (not  in  N.T.  save  Textus  Receptus  in  Luke  21:34). 
This  form,  rare  and  only  in  passive  (present,  aorist,  perfect) 
in  the  N.T.,  is  like  baruno,  from  barus,  and  that  from  baros, 
weight,  burden  (Gal.  6:2).  Hupnoi  is  in  the  instrumental 
case.  They  had  apparently  climbed  the  mountain  in  the 
early  part  of  the  night  and  were  now  overcome  with  sleep 
as  Jesus  prolonged  his  prayer.  Luke  alone  tells  of  their 
sleep.  The  same  word  is  used  of  the  eyes  of  these  three  dis- 
ciples in  the  Garden  of  Gethsemane  (Matt.  26:43)  and  of  the 
hearts  of  many  (Luke  21 134).  But  when  they  were  fully  awake 
{diagre  gores  antes  de).  First  aorist  active  participle  of  this 
late  (Herodian)  and  rare  compound  verb  (here  alone  in  the 
N.T.),  diagregoreo  (Luke  is  fond  of  compounds  with  did). 
The  simple  verb  gregoreb  (from  the  second  perfect  active 
egregora)  is  also  late,  but  common  in  the  LXX  and  the  N.T. 


132      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

The  effect  of  dia  can  be  either  to  remain  awake  in  spite  of 
desire  to  sleep  (margin  of  Revised  Version)  or  to  become 
thoroughly  awake  (ingressive  aorist  tense  also)  as  Revised 
Version  has  it.  This  is  most  likely  correct.  The  Syriac  Sina- 
itic  has  it  "When  they  awoke."  Certainly  they  had  been 
through  a  strain.  His  glory  {ten  doxan  autou).  See  also  verse 
26  in  the  words  of  Jesus. 

33.  As  they  were  departing  from  him  {en  toi  diachorizesthai 
autous  ap*  autou).  Peculiar  to  Luke  and  another  instance  of 
Luke's  common  idiom  of  en  with  the  articular  infinitive  in  a 
temporal  clause.  This  common  verb  occurs  here  only  in  the 
N.T.  The  present  middle  voice  means  to  separate  oneself 
fully  (direct  middle).  This  departing  of  Moses  and  Elijah 
apparently  accompanied  Peter's  remark  as  given  in  all  three 
Gospels.  See  for  details  on  Mark  and  Matthew.  Master 
{Epistata)  here,  Rabbi  (Mark  9:5),  Lord  {Kurie,  Matt.  17:4). 
Let  us  make  {poiesomen,  first  aorist  active  subjunctive)  as  in 
Mark  9:5,  but  Matt.  17:4  has  "I  will  make"  {poieso).  It 
was  near  the  time  of  the  feast  of  the  tabernacles.  So  Peter 
proposes  that  they  celebrate  it  up  here  instead  of  going  to 
Jerusalem  for  it  as  they  did  a  bit  later  (John  7).  Not  know- 
ing what  he  said  {me  eidos  ho  legei) .  Literally,  not  understand- 
ing what  he  was  saying  {me,  regular  negative  with  participle 
and  legei,  present  indicative  retained  in  relative  clause  in 
indirect  discourse).  Luke  puts  it  more  bluntly  than  Mark 
(Peter's  account),  "For  he  wist  not  what  to  answer;  for  they 
became  sore  afraid"  (Mark  9:6).  Peter  acted  according  to 
his  impulsive  nature  and  spoke  up  even  though  he  did  not 
know  what  to  say  or  even  what  he  was  saying  when  he  spoke. 
He  was  only  half  awake  as  Luke  explains  and  he  was  sore 
afraid  as  Mark  (Peter)  explains.  He  had  bewilderment 
enough  beyond  a  doubt,  but  it  was  Peter  who  spoke,  not 
James  and  John. 

34.  Overshadowed  them  {epeskiazen  autous).  Imperfect 
active  (aorist  in  Matt.  17:5)  as  present  participle  in  Mark 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  133 

9:7,  inchoative,  the  shadow  began  to  come  upon  them.  On 
Hermon  as  on  many  high  mountains  a  cloud  will  swiftly 
cover  the  cap.  I  have  seen  this  very  thing  at  Blue  Ridge, 
North  Carolina.  This  same  verb  is  used  of  the  Holy  Spirit 
upon  Mary  (Luke  1 3  5).  Nowhere  else  in  the  N.T.,  though 
an  old  verb  (epi,  skiazo,  from  skia,  shadow).  As  they  entered 
into  the  cloud  {en  toi  eiselthein  autous  eis  ten  nephelen).  Luke's 
idiom  of  en  with  the  articular  infinitive  again  (aorist  active 
this  time,  on  the  entering  in  as  to  them).  All  six  "entered 
into"  the  cloud,  but  only  Peter,  James,  and  John  "became 
afraid"  (ephobethesan,  ingressive  first  aorist  passive). 

35.  If  ekeinous  be  accepted  here  instead  of  autous,  the 
three  disciples  would  be  outside  of  the  cloud.  Out  of  the 
cloud  (ek  tes  nepheles).  This  voice  was  the  voice  of  the  Father 
like  that  at  the  baptism  of  Jesus  (Luke  3 :22  =  Mark  1:11  = 
Matt.  3  \\j)  and  like  that  near  the  end  (John  12:28-30)  when 
the  people  thought  it  was  a  clap  of  thunder  or  an  angel. 
My  son,  my  chosen  (Ho  huios  mou,  ho  eklelegmenos).  So  the 
best  documents  (Aleph  B  L  Syriac  Sinaitic).  The  others 
make  it  "My  Beloved"  as  in  Mark  9:7  =  Matt.  17:5.  These 
disciples  are  commanded  to  hear  Jesus,  God's  Son,  even 
when  he  predicts  his  death,  a  pointed  rebuke  to  Simon  Peter 
as  to  all. 

36.  When  the  voice  came  (en  toi  genesthai  ten  phonen) .  An- 
other example  of  Luke's  idiom,  this  time  with  the  second 
aorist  middle  infinitive.  Literally,  "on  the  coming  as  to  the 
voice"  (accusative  of  general  reference).  It  does  not  mean 
that  it  was  "after"  the  voice  was  past  that  Jesus  was  found 
alone,  but  simultaneously  with  it  (ingressive  aorist  tense). 
Alone  (monos).  Same  adjective  in  Mark  9:8  =  Matt.  17:8 
translated  "only."  Should  be  rendered  "alone"  there  also. 
They  held  their  peace  (esigesan).  Ingressive  aorist  active  of 
common  verb  sigao,  became  silent.  In  Mark  9:9  =  Matt. 
17:9,  Jesus  commanded  them  not  to  tell  till  His  Resurrection 
from  the  dead.    Luke  notes  that  they  in  awe  obeyed  that 


134      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

command  and  it  turns  out  that  they  finally  forgot  the  lesson 
of  this  night's  great  experience.  By  and  by  they  will  be  able 
to  tell  them,  but  not  "in  those  days."  Which  they  had  seen 
{hbn  hedrakan).  Attraction  of  the  relative  ha  into  the  case 
of  the  unexpressed  antecedent  toutbn.  Perfect  active  indic- 
ative hedrakan  with  Koine  (papyri)  form  for  the  ancient 
hebrakasin  changed  by  analogy  to  the  first  aorist  ending  in 
-an  instead  of  -asin. 

37.  On  the  next  day  (tei  hexes  hemerai).  Alone  in  Luke. 
It  shows  that  the  Transfiguration  took  place  on  the  preceding 
night.  They  were  come  down  {katelthontbn  auton).  Genitive 
absolute  of  second  aorist  active  participle  of  katerchomai, 
a  common  enough  verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  in  Luke's  writ- 
ings save  James  3  :i5-  Met  him  (sunentesen  autbi).  First  ao- 
rist active  of  sunantab,  common  compound  verb,  to  meet  with, 
only  in  Luke's  writings  in  the  N.T.  save  Heb.  7:1.  With  as- 
sociative instrumental  case  autbi. 

38.  Master  (Didaskale).  Teacher  as  in  Mark  9:17.  Lord 
(kurie,  Matt.  17:15).  To  look  upon  (epiblepsai).  Aorist 
active  infinitive  of  epiblepb  {epi,  upon,  blepb,  look),  common 
verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  James  2:3  except  Luke 
1  48  in  quotation  from  LXX.  This  compound  verb  is  com- 
mon in  medical  writers  for  examining  carefully  the  patient. 
Mine  only  child  (monogenes  moi).  Only  in  Luke  as  already 
about  an  only  child  in  7:12;  8:42. 

39.  Suddenly  (exephnes).  Old  adverb,  but  in  the  N.T. 
only  in  Luke's  writings  save  Mark  13:36.  Used  by  medical 
writers  of  sudden  attacks  of  disease  like  epilepsy.  It  teareth 
him  that  he  foameth  (sparassei  auton  meta  aphrou).  Literally, 
"It  tears  him  with  (accompanied  with,  meta)  foam"  (old 
word,  aphros,  only  here  in  the  N.T.).  From  spar  as  so,  to  con- 
vulse, a  common  verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Mark 
1 126 ;  9 :26  (a  nd  sunsparassb,  Mark  9 :2o) .  See  Ma  rk  9 : 1 7  and 
Matt.  17:15  and  Luke  9:39  for  variations  in  the  symptoms 
in  each  Gospel.    The  use  of  meta  aphrou  is  a  medical  item. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  135 

Hardly  (molis).  Late  word  used  in  place  of  mogis,  the  old 
Greek  term  (in  some  MSS.  here)  and  alone  in  Luke's  writings 
in  the  N.T.  save  I  Pet.  4:18  and  Rom.  5.7.  Bruising  him 
sorely  (suntribon  auton) .  Common  verb  for  rubbing  together, 
crushing  together  like  chains  (Mark  5 14)  or  as  a  vase  (Mark 
14:3).  See  on  Matthew  and  Mark  for  discussion  of  details 
here. 

41.  How  long  shall  I  be  with  you  and  bear  with  you?  (hebs 
pote  esomai  pros  humas  kai  anexomai  humbn;).  Here  the  two 
questions  of  Mark  9:19  (only  one  in  Matt.  17:17)  are  combined 
in  one  sentence.  Bear  with  (anexomai,  direct  middle  future) 
is,  hold  myself  from  you  (ablative  case  humbn).  Faithless 
(apistos)  is  disbelieving  and  perverse  (diestrammene,  perfect 
passive  participle  of  diastrephb),  is  twisted,  turned,  or  torn  in 
two. 

42.  As  he  was  yet  a  coming  (eti  proserchomenou  autou). 
Genitive  absolute.  While  he  was  yet  coming  (the  boy,  that  is, 
not  Jesus).  Note  quaint  English  "a  coming"  retained  in  the 
Revised  Version.  Dashed  him  (errexen  auton).  First  aorist 
active  indicative  of  regnumi  or  ressb,  to  rend  or  convulse, 
a  common  verb,  used  sometimes  of  boxers  giving  knockout 
blows.  Tare  grievously  (sunesparaxen).  Rare  word  as  only 
here  and  Mark  9:20  in  the  N.T.,  which  see.  Gave  him  back  to 
his  father  (apedbken  auton  tbi  patri  autou).  Tender  touch 
alone  in  Luke  as  in  7:15.  They  were  all  astonished  (exeples- 
sonto  de  pantes).  Imperfect  passive  of  the  common  verb 
ekplessb  or  ekplegnumi,  to  strike  out,  a  picturesque  description 
of  the  amazement  of  all  at  the  easy  victory  of  Jesus  where  the 
nine  disciples  had  failed.  At  the  majesty  of  God  (epi  tei  mega- 
leioteti  tou  theou).  A  late  word  from  the  adjective  megaleios 
and  that  from  megas  (great).  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and 
Acts  19:27  of  Artemis  and  in  II  Pet.  1  :i6  of  the  Transfigura- 
tion. It  came  to  be  used  by  the  emperors  like  our  word 
"Majesty."  Which  he  did  (hois  epoiei).  This  is  one  of  the 
numerous  poor  verse  divisions.    This  sentence  has  nothing 


136      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

to  do  with  the  first  part  of  the  verse.  The  imperfect  ac- 
tive epoiei  covers  a  good  deal  not  told  by  Luke  (see  Mark 
9 130  =  Matt.  17 :22).  Note  the  attraction  of  the  relative  hois 
into  the  case  of  pasin,  its  antecedent. 

44.  Sink  into  your  ears  (Thesthe  humeis  eis  ta  bta  humon). 
Second  aorist  imperative  middle  of  tithemi,  common  verb. 
"Do  you  (note  emphatic  position)  yourselves  (whatever 
others  do)  put  into  your  ears."  No  word  like  "sink"  here. 
The  same  prediction  here  a  s  in  Mark  9:31=  Matt.  17:22  about 
the  Son  of  man  only  without  mention  of  death  and  resurrec- 
tion as  there,  which  see  for  discussion. 

45.  It  was  concealed  from  them  {en  parakekalummenon  ap' 
autbn).  Periphrastic  past  perfect  of  parakalupto,  a  common 
verb,  but  only  here  in  the  N.T.,  to  cover  up,  to  hide  from. 
This  item  only  in  Luke.  That  they  should  not  perceive  it  (hina 
me  aisthontai  auto).  Second  aorist  middle  subjunctive  of  the 
common  verb  aisthanomai  used  with  hina  me,  negative  pur- 
pose. This  explanation  at  least  relieves  the  disciples  to 
some  extent  of  full  responsibility  for  their  ignorance  about 
the  death  of  Jesus  as  Mark  9:32  observes,  as  does  Luke  here 
that  they  were  afraid  to  ask  him.  Plummer  says,  "They 
were  not  allowed  to  understand  the  saying  then,  in  order 
that  they  might  remember  it  afterwards,  and  see  that  Jesus 
had  met  His  sufferings  with  full  knowledge  and  free  will." 
Perhaps  also,  if  they  had  fully  understood,  they  might  have 
lacked  courage  to  hold  on  to  the  end.  But  it  is  a  hard  prob- 
lem. 

46.  A  reasoning  (dialogismos).  A  dispute.  The  word  is 
from  dialogizomai,  the  verb  used  in  Mark  9:33  about  this 
incident.  In  Luke  this  dispute  follows  immediately  after 
the  words  of  Jesus  about  his  death.  They  were  afraid  to 
ask  Jesus  about  that  subject,  but  Matt.  18:1  states  that  they 
came  to  Jesus  to  settle  it.  Which  of  them  should  be  greatest 
(to  tis  an  eie  meizon  auibn).  Note  the  article  with  the  indi- 
rect question,  the  clause  being  in  the  accusative  of  general 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  137 

reference.  The  optative  with  an  is  here  because  it  was  so  in 
the  direct  question  (potential  optative  with  an  retained  in 
the  indirect).  But  Luke  makes  it  plain  that  it  was  not  an 
abstract  problem  about  greatness  in  the  kingdom  of  heaven 
as  they  put  it  to  Jesus  (Matt.  18:1),  but  a  personal  problem 
in  their  own  group.  Rivalries  and  jealousies  had  already 
come  and  now  sharp  words.  By  and  by  James  and  John 
will  be  bold  enough  to  ask  for  the  first  places  for  themselves 
in  this  political  kingdom  which  they  expect  (Mark  10:35=?= 
Matt.  20:20).    It  is  a  sad  spectacle. 

47.  Took  a  little  child  {epilabomenos  paidion).  Second 
aorist  middle  participle  of  the  common  verb  epilambano. 
Strictly,  Taking  a  little  child  to  himself  (indirect  middle). 
Mark  9:36  has  merely  the  active  labon  of  the  simple  verb 
lambano.  Set  him  by  his  side  (esiesen  auto  par'  heautoi). 
"In  his  arms"  Mark  9:36  has  it,  "in  the  midst  of  them" 
Matt.  18:3  says.  All  three  attitudes  following  one  another 
(the  disciples  probably  in  a  circle  around  Jesus  anyhow)  and 
now  the  little  child  (Peter's  child  ?)  was  slipped  down  by  the 
side  of  Jesus  as  he  gave  the  disciples  an  object  lesson  in 
humility  which  they  sorely  needed. 

48.  This  little  child  (touto  to  paidion).  As  Jesus  spoke  he 
probably  had  his  hand  upon  the  head  of  the  child.  Matt. 
18:5  has  "one  such  little  child."  The  honoured  disciple,  Jesus 
holds,  is  the  one  who  welcomes  little  children  "in  my  name" 
(epi  toi  onomati  mou),  upon  the  basis  of  my  name  and  my 
authority.  It  was  a  home-thrust  against  the  selfish  ambition 
of  the  Twelve.  Ministry  to  children  is  a  mark  of  greatness. 
Have  preachers  ever  yet  learned  how  to  win  children  to 
Christ?  They  are  allowed  to  slip  away  from  home,  from 
Sunday  school,  from  church,  from  Christ.  For  he  that  is 
least  among  you  all  (ho  gar  mikroteros  en  pasin  humin  hupar- 
chon).  Note  the  use  of  huparchb  as  in  8:41  and  23  :5c  The 
comparative  mikroteros  is  in  accord  with  the  Koine  idiom 
where  the  superlative  is  vanishing  (nearly  gone  in  modern 


138      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Greek).    But  great  (me gas)  is  positive  and  very  strong.    This 
saying  peculiar  to  Luke  here. 

49.  And  John  answered  (apokritheis  de  Ioanes).  As  if 
John  wanted  to  change  the  subject  after  the  embarrassment 
of  the  rebuke  for  their  dispute  concerning  greatness  (Luke 
9:46-48).  Master  (epistata).  Only  in  Luke  in  the  N.T.  as 
already  four  times  (5:5;  8:24,  45;  9:33).  We  forbade  him 
(ekoluomen  auton).  Conative  imperfect  as  in  Mark  9:38, 
We  tried  to  hinder  him.  Because  he  jolloweth  not  with  us 
(hoti  ouk  akolouthei  meth  hemon).  Present  tense  preserved 
for  vividness  where  Mark  has  imperfect  ekolouthei.  Note 
also  here  "with  us"  (meth''  hemon)  where  Mark  has  associa- 
tive instrumental  hemin.  It  is  a  pitiful  specimen  of  partisan 
narrowness  and  pride  even  in  the  Beloved  Disciple,  one  of 
the  Sons  of  Thunder.  The  man  was  doing  the  Master's 
work  in  the  Master's  name  and  with  the  Master's  power, 
but  did  not  run  with  the  group  of  the  Twelve. 

50.  "  Against  you  is  for  you"  (kath?  humon  huper  humon). 
Mark  9:40  has  "against  us  is  for  us"  (hemon  .  .  .  hemon). 
The  Koine  Greek  e  and  u  were  often  pronounced  alike  and 
it  was  easy  to  interchange  them.  So  many  MSS.  here  read 
just  as  in  Mark.  The  point  is  precisely  the  same  as  it  is  a 
proverbial  saying.  See  a  similar  saying  in  Luke  11:23: 
"He  that  is  not  with  me  is  against  me."  The  prohibition 
here  as  in  Mark  9:39  is  general:  "Stop  hindering  him" 
(me  koluete,  me  and  the  present  imperative,  not  me  and  the 
aorist  subjunctive).  The  lesson  of  toleration  in  methods  of 
work  for  Christ  is  needed  today. 

51.  When  the  days  were  well-nigh  come  (en  tbi  sumplerous- 
thai  tas  hemeras).  Luke's  common  idiom  en  with  the  articu- 
lar infinitive,  "in  the  being  fulfilled  as  to  the  days."  This 
common  compound  occurs  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke 
8:23  and  Acts  2:1.  The  language  here  makes  it  plain  that 
Jesus  was  fully  conscious  of  the  time  of  his  death  as  near  as 
already  stated  (Luke  9:22,  27,  31).     That  he  should  be  re- 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  139 

ceived  up  (tes  analempseos  autou).  Literally,  "of  his  taking 
up."  It  is  an  old  word  (from  Hippocrates  on),  but  here 
alone  in  the  N.T.  It  is  derived  from  analambano  (the  verb 
used  of  the  Ascension,  Acts  1:2,  11,  22;  I  Tim.  3:16)  and  re- 
fers here  to  the  Ascension  of  Jesus  after  His  Resurrection. 
Not  only  in  John's  Gospel  (17:5)  does  Jesus  reveal  a  yearning 
for  a  return  to  the  Father,  but  it  is  in  the  mind  of  Christ 
here  as  evidently  at  the  Transfiguration  (9:31)  and  later  in 
Luke  12:49^  He  steadfastly  set  his  face  {autos  to  prosbpon 
esterisen).  Note  emphatic  autos,  he  himself,  with  fixedness 
of  purpose  in  the  face  of  difficulty  and  danger.  This  look 
on  Christ's  face  as  he  went  to  his  doom  is  noted  later  in 
Mark  10:32.  It  is  a  Hebraistic  idiom  (nine  times  in  Ezekiel), 
this  use  of  face  here,  but  the  verb  (effective  aorist  active) 
is  an  old  one  from  sterizo  (from  sterigx,  a  support),  to  set 
fast,  to  fix.  To  go  to  Jerusalem  {tou  poreuesthai  eis  Ierou- 
salem).  Genitive  infinitive  of  purpose.  Luke  three  times 
mentions  Christ  making  his  way  to  Jerusalem  (9:51; 
13:22;  17:11)  and  John  mentions  three  journeys  to  Jeru- 
salem during  the  later  ministry  (7:10;  11:17;  12:1).  It  is 
natural  to  take  these  journeys  to  be  the  same  in  each 
of  these  Gospels.  Luke  does  not  make  definite  location 
of  each  incident  and  John  merely  supplements  here  and 
there.  But  in  a  broad  general  way  they  seem  to  corre- 
spond. 

52.  Sent  messengers  (apesteilen  aggelous).  As  a  precau- 
tion since  he  was  going  to  Jerusalem  through  Samaria.  The 
Samaritans  did  not  object  when  people  went  north  from 
Jerusalem  through  their  country.  He  was  repudiating 
Mount  Gerizim  by  going  by  it  to  Jerusalem.  This  was  an 
unusual  precaution  by  Jesus  and  we  do  not  know  who  the 
messengers  (angels)  were.  To  make  ready  for  him  (hos  hetoi- 
masai  autoi).  Hos  is  correct  here,  not  hoste.  The  only  ex- 
amples of  the  final  use  of  hos  with  the  infinitive  in  the  N.T. 
are  this  one  and  Heb.  7:9  (absolute  use).     In  Acts  20:24 


140      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Westcott  and  Hort  read  hbs  teleioso  and  put  hbs  teleibsai  in 
the  margin  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1091). 

53.  And  they  did  not  receive  him  {kai  ouk  edexanto  auton). 
Adversative  use  of  kai  =  But.  Because  his  face  was  going 
to  Jerusalem  (hoti  to  prosbpon  autou  en  poreuomenon  eis 
Ierousalem).  Periphrastic  imperfect  middle.  It  was  reason 
enough  to  the  churlish  Samaritans. 

54.  Saw  this  (idontes).  Second  aorist  active  participle 
of  horab.  Saw  the  messengers  returning.  We  bid  (theleis 
eipomen).  Deliberative  subjunctive  eipomen  after  theleis 
without  hina,  probably  two  questions,  Dost  thou  wish? 
Shall  we  bid?  Perhaps  the  recent  appearance  of  Elijah  on 
the  Mount  of  Transfiguration  reminded  James  and  John 
of  the  incident  in  II  Kings  1:10-12.  Some  MSS.  add  here 
"as  Elijah  did."  The  language  of  the  LXX  is  quoted  by 
James  and  John,  these  fiery  Sons  of  Thunder.  Note  the 
two  aorist  active  infinitives  {katabenai,  analbsai,  the  first 
ingressive,  the  second  effective). 

55.  But  he  turned  (strapheis  de).  Second  aorist  passive 
participle  of  strepho,  common  verb,  to  turn  round.  Dra- 
matic act.  Some  ancient  MSS.  have  here:  Ye  know  not 
what  manner  of  spirit  ye  are  of  {ouk  oidate  poiou  pneumatos 
este).  This  sounds  like  Christ  and  may  be  a  genuine  saying 
though  not  a  part  of  Luke's  Gospel.  A  smaller  number  of 
MSS.  add  also:  For  the  Son  of  Man  came  not  to  destroy 
men's  lives,  but  to  save  them  {Ho  gar  huios  tou  anthrbpou 
ouk  elthen  psuckas  anthrbpbn  apolesai  alia  sbsai),  a  saying 
reminding  us  of  Matt.  5:17  and  Luke  19:10.  Certain  it  is 
that  here  Jesus  rebuked  the  bitterness  of  James  and  John 
toward  Samaritans  as  he  had  already  chided  John  for  his 
narrowness  towards  a  fellow-worker  in  the  kingdom. 

57.  A  certain  man  {tis).  Matt.  8:19  calls  him  "a  scribe." 
Luke  9:57-60  =  Matt.  8:19-22,  but  not  in  Mark  and  so 
from  Q  or  the  Logia.  Wherever  you  go  {hopou  ean  aperchei) 
is  the  present  middle  subjunctive  with  the  indefinite  rela- 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  141 

tive  adverb  ean,  common  Greek  idiom.  See  on  Matthew  for 
"holes,"  "nests,"  "Son  of  man."  The  idiom  "where  to 
lay  his  head"  (pou  ten  kephalen  klinei)  is  the  same  in  both, 
the  deliberative  subjunctive  retained  in  the  indirect  ques- 
tion. "Jesus  knows  the  measure  of  the  scribe's  enthusiasm" 
(Plummer).  The  wandering  life  of  Jesus  explains  this  state- 
ment. 

59.  And  he  said  unto  another  (eipen  de  pros  heteron). 
Matt.  8:21  omits  Christ's  "Follow  me"  (akolouthei  moi) 
and  makes  this  man  a  volunteer  instead  of  responding  to 
the  appeal  of  Jesus.  There  is  no  real  opposition,  of  course. 
In  Matthew's  account  the  man  is  apologetic  as  in  Luke. 
Plummer  calls  him  "one  of  the  casual  disciples"  of  whom 
there  are  always  too  many.  The  scribes  knew  how  to  give 
plausible  reasons  for  not  being  active  disciples.  First  {pro- 
ton). One  of  the  problems  of  life  is  the  relation  of  duties  to 
each  other,  which  comes  first.  The  burial  of  one's  father 
was  a  sacred  duty  (Gen.  25:9),  but,  as  in  the  case  of  Tobit 
4:3,  this  scribe's  father  probably  was  still  alive.  What  the 
scribe  apparently  meant  was  that  he  could  not  leave  his 
father  while  still  alive  to  follow  Jesus  around  over  the  coun- 
try. 

60.  Leave  the  dead  to  bury  their  own  dead  {aphes  tous  nek- 
rous  thapsai  tous  heautbn  nekrous).  This  paradox  occurs  so 
in  Matt.  8 :22.  The  explanation  is  that  the  spiritually  dead 
can  bury  the  literally  dead.  For  such  a  quick  change  in  the 
use  of  the  same  words  see  John  5:21-29  (spiritual  resurrec- 
tion from  sin  in  21-27,  bodily  resurrection  from  the  grave, 
28  and  29)  and  John  n:25f.  The  harshness  of  this  proverb 
to  the  scribe  probably  is  due  to  the  fact  that  he  was  mani- 
festly using  his  aged  father  as  an  excuse  for  not  giving  Christ 
active  service.  But  go  thou  and  publish  abroad  the  kingdom 
of  God  (su  de  apelthbn  diaggelle  ten  basileian  tou  theou) .  The 
scribe's  duty  is  put  sharply  (But  do  thou,  su  de).  Christ 
called  him  to  preach,  and  he  was  using  pious  phrases  about 


14.2      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

his  father  as  a  pretext.  Many  a  preacher  has  had  to  face  a 
similar  delicate  problem  of  duty  to  father,  mother,  brothers, 
sisters  and  the  call  to  preach.  This  was  a  clear  case.  Jesus 
will  help  any  man  called  to  preach  to  see  his  duty.  Certainly 
Jesus  does  not  advocate  renunciation  of  family  duties  on 
the  part  of  preachers. 

61.  And  another  also  said  (eipen  de  kai  heteros).  A  volun- 
teer like  the  first.  This  third  case  is  given  by  Luke  alone, 
though  the  incident  may  also  come  from  the  same  Logia  as 
the  other  two.  Heteros  does  not  here  mean  one  of  a  "differ- 
ent" sort  as  is  sometimes  true  of  this  pronoun,  but  merely 
another  like  alios  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  749).  But  first 
{proton  de).  He  also  had  something  that  was  to  come 
"first."  To  bid  farewell  to  them  that  are  at  my  house  (apo- 
taxasthai  tois  eis  ton  oikon  mou).  In  itself  that  was  a  good 
thing  to  do.  This  first  aorist  middle  infinitive  is  from 
apotasso,  an  old  verb,  to  detach,  to  separate,  to  assign  as  a 
detachment  of  soldiers.  In  the  N.T.  it  only  appears  in  the 
middle  voice  with  the  meaning  common  in  late  writers  to 
bid  adieu,  to  separate  oneself  from  others.  It  is  used  in 
Acts  18:18  of  Paul  taking  leave  of  the  believers  in  Corinth. 
See  also  Mark  6:46;  II  Cor.  2:13.  It  is  thus  a  formal 
function  and  this  man  meant  to  go  home  and  set  things 
in  order  there  and  then  in  due  time  to  come  and  follow 
Jesus. 

62.  Having  put  his  hand  to  the  plough  {epibalon  ten  cheira  ep' 
arotron).  Second  aorist  active  participle  of  epiballo,  an  old 
and  common  verb,  to  place  upon.  Note  repetition  of  preposi- 
tion epi  before  arotron  (plough).  This  agricultural  proverb  is 
as  old  as  Hesiod.  Pliny  observes  that  the  ploughman  who 
does  not  bend  attentively  to  his  work  goes  crooked.  It 
has  always  been  the  ambition  of  the  ploughman  to  run  a 
straight  furrow.  The  Palestine  fellah  had  good  success  at 
it.  And  looking  back  {kai  blepbn  eis  ta  opiso).  Looking  to 
the  things  behind.     To  do  that  is  fatal  as  any  ploughman 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  143 

knows.  The  call  to  turn  back  is  often  urgent.  Fit  {euthetos) . 
From  eu  and  tithemi  =  well-placed,  suited  for,  adapted  to. 
"The  first  case  is  that  of  inconsiderate  impulse,  the  second 
that  of  conflicting  duties,  the  third  tiiat  of  a  divided  mind" 
(Bruce). 


CHAPTER  X 

i.  Appointed  {anedeixen).  First  aorist  active  indicative 
of  anadeiknumi,  an  old  verb,  not  only  common,  but  in  LXX. 
In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  1 124.  Cf.  anadeixis  in  Luke 
1 :8o.  To  show  forth,  display,  proclaim,  appoint.  Seventy 
others  {heterous  hebdomekonta  kai).  The  "also"  {kai)  and 
the  "others"  point  back  to  the  mission  of  the  Twelve  in 
Galilee  (9:1-6).  Some  critics  think  that  Luke  has  con- 
fused this  report  of  a  mission  in  Judea  with  that  in  Galilee, 
but  needlessly  so.  What  earthly  objection  can  there  be  to 
two  similar  missions  ?  B  D  Syr.  Cur.  and  Syr.  Sin.  have  "sev- 
enty-two." The  seventy  elders  were  counted  both  ways 
and  the  Sanhedrin  likewise  and  the  nations  of  the  earth. 
It  is  an  evenly  balanced  point.  Two  and  two  {ana  duo). 
For  companionship  as  with  the  Twelve  though  Mark  6:7  has 
it  duo  duo  (vernacular  idiom).  B  K  have  here  ana  duo  duo,  a 
combination  of  the  idiom  in  Mark.  6:7  and  that  here.  He 
himself  was  about  to  come  {emellen  autos  erchesthai).  Im- 
perfect of  mellb  with  present  infinitive  and  note  autos. 
Jesus  was  to  follow  after  and  investigate  the  work  done. 
This  was  only  a  temporary  appointment  and  no  names  are 
given,  but  they  could  cover  a  deal  of  territory. 

2.  Harvest  (therismos).  Late  word  for  the  older  theros, 
summer,  harvest.  The  language  in  this  verse  is  verbatim 
what  we  have  in  Matt.  9:37  and  38  to  the  Twelve.  Why  not? 
The  need  is  the  same  and  prayer  is  the  answer  in  each  case. 
Prayer  for  preachers  is  Christ's  method  for  increasing  the 
supply. 

3.  As  lambs  {hos  arnas).  Here  again  the  same  language  as 
that  in  Matt.  10:16  except  that  there  "sheep"  {probata) 
appears  instead  of  "lambs."     Pathetic  picture  of  the  risks 

144 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  145 

of  missionaries  for  Christ.    They  take  their  life  in  their 
hands. 

4.  Purse  {ballantion) .  Old  word  for  money-bag,  sometimes 
a  javelin  as  if  from  hallo.  Only  in  Luke  in  the  N.T.  (10:4; 
12:33;  22:35ff-)-  See  Luke  9:3=  Mark.  6:jf.  =  Matt.  10:91. 
for  the  other  similar  items.  Salute  no  man  on  the  way  {medena 
kata  ten  hodon  aspasesthe).  First  aorist  (ingressive)  middle 
subjunctive  with  medena.  The  peril  of  such  wayside  saluta- 
tions was  palaver  and  delay.  The  King's  business  required 
haste.  Elisha's  servant  was  not  to  tarry  for  salutations  or 
salaams  (II  Kings  4:29).  These  oriental  greetings  were  tedi- 
ous, complicated,  and  often  meddlesome  if  others  were  pres- 
ent or  engaged  in  a  bargain. 

5.  First  say  {proton  legete).  Say  first.  The  adverb  proton 
can  be  construed  with  "enter"  {eiselthete) ,  but  probably 
with  legete  is  right.  The  word  spoken  is  the  usual  oriental 
salutation. 

6.  A  son  of  peace  {huios  eirenes).  A  Hebraism,  though 
some  examples  occur  in  the  vernacular  Koine  papyri.  It 
means  one  inclined  to  peace,  describing  the  head  of  the  house- 
hold. Shall  rest  (epanapaesetai) .  Second  future  passive  of 
epanapauo,  a  late  double  compound  (epi,  ana)  of  the  common 
verb  pauo.  It  shall  turn  to  you  again  {eph'  humds  anakampsei) . 
Common  verb  anakampto,  to  bend  back,  return.  The  peace 
in  that  case  will  bend  back  with  blessing  upon  the  one  who 
spoke  it. 

7.  In  that  same  house  {en  autei  iei  oikidi).  Literally,  in 
the  house  itself,  not "  in  the  same  house"  {en  iei  autei  oikidi), 
a  different  construction.  A  free  rendering  of  the  common 
Lukan  idiom  is,  "in  that  very  house."  Eating  {esthontes). 
An  old  poetic  verb  estho  for  esthib  that  survives  in  late  Greek. 
Such  things  as  they  give  {ta  par*  auton).  "The  things  from 
them."  For  the  labourer  is  worthy  of  his  hire  {axios  gar  ho  er- 
gaies  tou  misthou  autou).  In  Matt.  10:10  we  have  tes  trophes 
autou  (his  food).     I  Tim.  5:18  has  this  saying  quoted  as 


146      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

scripture.  That  is  not  impossible  if  Luke  wrote  by  a.d.  62. 
Paul  there  however  may  quote  only  Deut.  25:4  as  scripture 
and  get  this  quotation  either  from  Luke  10:7  or  from  a  pro- 
verbial saying  of  Jesus.  It  is  certainly  not  a  real  objection 
against  the  Pauline  authorship  of  First  Timothy.  Go  not 
from  house  to  house  (me  metabainete  ex  oikias  eis  oikian).  As 
a  habit,  vie  and  the  present  imperative,  and  so  avoid  waste 
of  time  with  such  rounds  of  invitations  as  would  come. 

8.  Such  things  as  are  set  before  you  {ta  paratithemena 
humin).  The  things  placed  before  you  from  time  to  time 
(present  passive  participle,  repetition).  Every  preacher  needs 
this  lesson  of  common  politeness.  These  directions  may 
seem  perfunctory  and  even  commonplace,  but  every  teacher 
of  young  preachers  knows  how  necessary  they  are.  Hence 
they  were  given  both  to  the  Twelve  and  to  the  Seventy. 

9.  Is  come  nigh  unto  you  (eggiken  epK  humas).  Perfect 
active  indicative  of  eggizb  as  in  Matt.  3  :2  of  the  Baptist  and 
Mark  1:15  of  Jesus.    Note  epK  humas  here. 

10.  Into  the  streets  thereof  (eis  tas  plateias  auies).  Out  of 
the  inhospitable  houses  into  the  broad  open  streets. 

11.  Even  the  dust  (kai  ton  koniorton).  Old  word  from 
konis,  dust,  and  ornumi,  to  stir  up.  We  have  seen  it  already 
in  Matt.  10:14;  Luke  9:5.  Dust  is  a  plague  in  the  east. 
Shake  off  even  that.  Cleaveth  (kollethenta) .  First  aorist 
passive  participle  of  kollao,  to  cling  as  dust  and  mud  do  to 
shoes.  Hence  the  orientals  took  off  the  sandals  on  entering 
a  house.  We  wipe  off  (apomassometha).  Middle  voice  of  an 
old  verb  apomasso,  to  rub  off  with  the  hands.  Nowhere  else 
in  the  N.T.  But  ekmasso,  occurs  in  Luke  7:38,  44.  Against 
you  (Humin).  Fine  example  of  the  dative  of  disadvantage 
(the  case  of  personal  interest,  the  dative). 

12.  More  tolerable  (anektoteron) .  Comparative  of  the 
verbal  adjective  anektos  from  anechomai.  An  old  adjective, 
but  only  the  comparative  in  the  N.T.  and  in  this  phrase 
(Matt.  10:15;  11:22,  24;  Luke  10:12,  14). 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  147 

13.  Would  have  repented  (an  metenoesan).  Conclusion 
(apodosis)  of  second-class  condition,  determined  as  unful- 
filled. Long  ago  (palai).  Implies  a  considerable  ministry 
in  these  cities  of  which  we  are  not  told.  Chorazin  not  men- 
tioned save  here  and  Matt.  11:21.  Perhaps  Karazeh  near 
Tell  Hum  (Capernaum).  Sitting  in  sackcloth  and  ashes  (en 
sakkbi  kai  spodbi  kathemenoi).  Pictorial  and  graphic.  The 
sakkos  (sackcloth)  was  dark  coarse  cloth  made  of  goat's  hair 
and  worn  by  penitents,  mourners,  suppliants.  It  is  a  Hebrew 
word,  sag.  The  rough  cloth  was  used  for  sacks  or  bags.  To 
cover  oaeself  with  ashes  was  a  mode  of  punishment  as  well  as 
of  voluntary  humiliation. 

15.  Shalt  thou  be  exalted?  (me  hupsbthesei;).  Me  expects 
the  answer  No.  The  verb  is  future  passive  indicative  second 
singular  of  hupsob,  to  lift  up,  a  late  verb  from  hupsos,  height. 
It  is  used  by  Jesus  of  the  Cross  (John  12:32).  Unto  Hades 
(hebs  Haidou).  See  on  Matt.  16:18  for  this  word  which  is 
here  in  contrast  to  Heaven  as  in  Isa.  14:13-15.  Hades  is  not 
Gehenna.  "The  desolation  of  the  whole  neighbourhood,  and 
the  difficulty  of  identifying  even  the  site  of  these  flourishing 
towns,  is  part  of  the  fulfilment  of  this  prophecy"  (Plummer). 
Ragg  notes  the  omission  of  Nazareth  from  this  list  of  cities 
of  neglected  privilege  and  opportunity.  "Is  it  the  tender 
memories  of  boyhood  that  keep  from  His  lips  the  name  of 
the  arch-rejector  (4:28  sqq.)  Nazareth?" 

16.  Rejecteth  him  that  sent  me  (athetei  ton  aposteilanta  me). 
These  solemn  words  form  a  fit  close  for  this  discourse  to  the 
Seventy.  The  fate  of  Chorazin,  Bethsaida,  Capernaum  will 
befall  those  who  set  aside  (a  privative  and  theteb,  from  ti- 
themi)  the  mission  and  message  of  these  messengers  of 
Christ.  See  this  verb  used  in  7:30  of  the  attitude  of  the 
scribes  and  Pharisees  toward  John  and  Jesus.  It  is  this 
thought  that  makes  it  so  grave  a  responsibility  to  be  co-work- 
ers with  Christ,  high  privilege  as  it  is  (John  9:4). 

17.  Returned  with  joy  (hupe 'Streps an  meta  char  as).    They 


148      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

had  profited  by  the  directions  of  Jesus.  Joy  overflows  their 
faces  and  their  words.  Even  the  demons  {kai  ta  daimonid). 
This  was  a  real  test.  The  Twelve  had  been  expressly  endowed 
with  this  power  when  they  were  sent  out  (Luke  9:1),  but 
the  Seventy  were  only  told  to  heal  the  sick  (10:9).  It  was 
better  than  they  expected.  The  Gospel  worked  wonders  and 
they  were  happy.  The  demons  were  merely  one  sign  of  the 
conflict  between  Christ  and  Satan.  Every  preacher  has  to 
grapple  with  demons  in  his  work.  Are  subject  {hupotassetai). 
Present  passive  indicative  (repetition). 

18.  /  beheld  Satan  fallen  {ethebroun  ton  Satanan  pesonta). 
Imperfect  active  (I  was  beholding)  and  second  aorist  (con- 
stative)  active  participle  of  piptb  (not  fallen,  peptbkota,  per- 
fect active  participle,  nor  falling,  piptonta,  present  active 
participle,  but  fall,  pesonta).  As  a  flash  of  lightning  out  of 
heaven,  quick  and  startling,  so  the  victory  of  the  Seventy 
over  the  demons,  the  agents  of  Satan,  forecast  his  downfall 
and  Jesus  in  vision  pictured  it  as  a  flash  of  lightning. 

19.  And  over  all  the  power  of  the  enemy  {kai  epi  pas  an  ten 
dunamin  tou  echthrou).  This  is  the  heart  of  "the  authority" 
{ten  exousian)  here  given  by  Jesus  which  is  far  beyond  their 
expectations.  The  victory  over  demons  was  one  phase  of  it. 
The  power  to  tread  upon  serpents  is  repeated  in  Mark  16:18 
(the  Appendix)  and  exemplified  in  Paul's  case  in  Malta 
(Acts  28:3-5).  But  protection  from  physical  harm  is  not 
the  main  point  in  this  struggle  with  Satan  "the  enemy" 
(Matt.  13:25;  Rom.  16:20;  I  Pet.  5:8).  Nothing  shall  in  any 
wise  hurt  you  {ouden  humas  ou  me  adikesei).  Text  has  future 
active  indicative,  while  some  MSS.  read  adikesei,  aorist  active 
subjunctive  of  adikeb,  common  verb  from  adikos  {a  privative 
and  dikos),  to  suffer  wrong,  to  do  wrong.  The  triple  negative 
here  is  very  strong.  Certainly  Jesus  does  not  mean  this 
promise  to  create  presumption  or  foolhardiness  for  he  re- 
pelled the  enemy's  suggestion  on  the  pinnacle  of  the  temple. 

20.  Are  written  {engegraptai).    Perfect  passive  indicative, 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  149 

state  of  completion,  stand  written,  enrolled  or  engraved, 
from  engraphb,  common  verb.  "As  citizens  possessing  the 
full  privileges  of  the  commonwealth"  (Plummer). 

21.  In  that  same  hour  {en  auiei  tei  hbrai).  Literally,  "at 
the  hour  itself,"  almost  a  demonstrative  use  of  autos  (Robert- 
son, Grammar,  p.  686)  and  in  Luke  alone  in  the  N.T.  (2:38; 
10:21;  12:12;  20:19).  Matt.  11:25  uses  tne  demonstrative 
here,  "at  that  time"  {en  ekeinbi  tbi  kairbi).  Rejoiced  in  the 
Holy  Spirit  {egalliasato  tbi  pneumati  tbi  hagibi).  First  aorist 
middle  of  the  late  verb  agalliab  for  agallb,  to  exult.  Always  in 
the  middle  in  the  N.T.  save  Luke  1 47  in  Mary's  Magnificat. 
This  holy  joy  of  Jesus  was  directly  due  to  the  Holy  Spirit. 
It  is  joy  in  the  work  of  his  followers,  their  victories  over 
Satan,  and  is  akin  to  the  joy  felt  by  Jesus  in  John  4:32-38 
when  the  vision  of  the  harvest  of  the  world  stirred  his  heart. 
The  rest  of  this  verse  is  precisely  like  Matt.  n:25f.,  a  pe- 
culiarly Johannine  passage  in  Matthew  and  Luke,  but  not 
in  Mark,  and  so  from  Q  (the  Logia  of  Jesus).  It  has  dis- 
turbed critics  who  are  unwilling  to  admit  the  Johannine 
style  and  type  of  teaching  as  genuine,  but  here  it  is.  See 
on  Matthew  for  discussion.  "That  God  had  proved  his 
independence  of  the  human  intellect  is  a  matter  for  thank- 
fulness. Intellectual  gifts,  so  far  from  being  necessary,  are 
often  a  hindrance"  (Plummer). 

22.  Knoweth  who  the  Son  is  {ginbskei  tis  estin  ho  huios). 
Knows  by  experience,  ginbskei.  Here  Matt.  11:27  nas 
epiginbskei  (fully  knows)  and  simply  ton  huion  (the  Son) 
instead  of  the  "who"  (tis)  clause.  So  also  in  "who  the 
Father  is"  {tis  estin  ho  pater).  But  the  same  use  and  con- 
trast of  "the  Father,"  "the  Son."  in  both  Matthew  and 
Luke,  "an  aerolite  from  the  Johannean  heaven"  (Hase). 
No  sane  criticism  can  get  rid  of  this  Johannine  bit  in  these 
Gospels  written  long  before  the  Fourth  Gospel  was  com- 
posed. We  are  dealing  here  with  the  oldest  known  document 
about  Christ  (the  Logia)  and  the  picture  is  that  drawn  in  the 


150      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Fourth  Gospel  (see  my  The  Christ  of  the  Logia).  It  is  idle 
to  try  to  whittle  away  by  fantastic  exegesis  the  high  claims 
made  by  Jesus  in  this  passage.  It  is  an  ecstatic  prayer  in 
the  presence  of  the  Seventy  under  the  rapture  of  the  Holy 
Spirit  on  terms  of  perfect  equality  and  understanding  be- 
tween the  Father  and  the  Son  in  the  tone  of  the  priestly 
prayer  in  John  17.  We  are  justified  in  saying  that  this  prayer 
of  supreme  Fellowship  with  the  Father  in  contemplation  of 
final  victory  over  Satan  gives  us  a  glimpse  of  the  prayers 
with  the  Father  when  the  Son  spent  whole  nights  on  the 
mountain  alone  with  the  Father.  Here  is  the  Messianic 
consciousness  in  complete  control  and  with  perfect  confidence 
in  the  outcome.  Here  as  in  Matt.  1 1 :2J  by  the  use  of  zvilleth 
to  reveal  him  (bouletai  apokalupsai).  The  Son  claims  the 
power  to  reveal  the  Father  "to  whomsoever  he  wills"  {hoi 
an  bouletai,  indefinite  relative  and  present  subjunctive  of 
boulomai,  to  will,  not  the  future  indicative).  This  is  divine 
sovereignty  most  assuredly.  Human  free  agency  is  also 
true,  but  it  is  full  divine  sovereignty  in  salvation  that  is  here 
claimed  along  with  possession  (paredothe,  timeless  aorist 
passive  indicative)  of  all  power  from  the  Father.  Let  that 
supreme  claim  stand. 

23.  Turning  to  the  disciples  (strapheis  pros  tous  mathetas). 
Second  aorist  passive  of  strepho  as  in  9:55.  The  prayer  was 
a  soliloquy  though  uttered  in  the  presence  of  the  Seventy  on 
their  return.  Now  Jesus  turned  and  spoke  "privately" 
or  to  the  disciples  (the  Twelve,  apparently),  whether  on  this 
same  occasion  or  a  bit  later.  Blessed  (makarioi).  A  beati- 
tude, the  same  adjective  as  in  Matt.  5:3-11.  A  beatitude  of 
privilege  very  much  like  that  in  Matt.  13-16.  Jesus  often 
repeated  his  sayings. 

24.  Which  ye  see  (ha  humeis  blepete).  The  expression  of 
humeis  makes  "ye"  very  emphatic  in  contrast  with  the 
prophets  and  kings  of  former  days. 

25.  And  tempted  him  (ekpeirazon  auton).     Present  active 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  151 

participle,  conative  idea,  trying  to  tempt  him.  There  is  no 
"and"  in  the  Greek.  He  "stood  up  (aneste,  ingressive  sec- 
ond aorist  active)  trying  to  tempt  him."  Peirazb  is  a  late 
form  of  peirao  and  ekpeirazb  apparently  only  in  the  LXX, 
and  N.T.  (quoted  by  Jesus  from  Deut.  6:16  in  Matt.  4:7  = 
Luke  4:12  against  Satan).  Here  and  I  Cor.  10:9.  The  spirit 
of  this  lawyer  was  evil.  He  wanted  to  entrap  Jesus  if  pos- 
sible. What  shall  I  do  to  inherit  eternal  life?  (Ti  poiesas  zoen 
aibniou  kleronomeso;).  Literally,  "By  doing  what  shall  I 
inherit  eternal  life?"  Note  the  emphasis  on  "doing" 
{poiesas).  The  form  of  his  question  shows  a  wrong  idea  as 
to  how  to  get  it.  Eternal  life  (zoen  aibnion)  is  endless  life 
as  in  John's  Gospel  (16:9;  18:18,  30)  and  in  Matt.  25:46, 
which  see. 

26.  How  readest  thou?  (pbs  anaginoskeis;).  As  a  lawyer 
it  was  his  business  to  know  the  facts  in  the  law  and  the  proper 
interpretation  of  the  law.  See  on  Luke  7:30  about  nomikos 
(lawyer).    The  rabbis  had  a  formula,  "What  readest  thou?" 

27.  And  he  answering  (ho  de  apokritheis) .  First  aorist 
participle,  no  longer  passive  in  idea.  The  lawyer's  answer 
is  first  from  the  Shema?  (Deut.  6:3;  n  113)  which  was  written 
on  the  phylacteries.  The  second  part  is  from  Lev.  19:18 
and  shows  that  the  lawyer  knew  the  law.  At  a  later  time 
Jesus  himself  in  the  temple  gives  a  like  summary  of  the  law 
to  a  lawyer  (Mark  12  =28-34  =  Matt.  22  =34-40)  who  wanted  to 
catch  Jesus  by  his  question.  There  is  no  difficulty  in  the  two 
incidents.  God  is  to  be  loved  with  all  of  man's  four  powers 
(heart,  soul,  strength,  mind)  here  as  in  Mark  12:30. 

28.  Thou  hast  answered  right  (orthos  apekrithes).  First 
aorist  passive  indicative  second  singular  with  the  adverb 
orthos.  The  answer  was  correct  so  far  as  the  words  went.  In 
Mark  12:34  Jesus  commends  the  scribe  for  agreeing  to  his 
interpretation  of  the  first  and  the  second  commandments. 
That  scribe  was  "not  far  from  the  kingdom  of  God,"  but  this 
lawyer  was  "tempting"  Jesus.     Do  this  and  thou  shall  live 


152      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

(touto  poiei  kai  zesei).  Present  imperative  (keep  on  doing  this 
forever)  and  the  future  indicative  middle  as  a  natural  result. 
There  was  only  one  trouble  with  the  lawyer's  answer.  No 
one  ever  did  or  ever  can  "do"  what  the  law  lays  down  to- 
wards God  and  man  always.  To  slip  once  is  to  fail.  So 
Jesus  put  the  problem  squarely  up  to  the  lawyer  who  wanted 
to  know  by  doing  what.  Of  course,  if  he  kept  the  law 
perfectly  always,  he  would  inherit  eternal  life. 

29.  Desiring  to  justify  himself  (thelon  dikaiosai  heauton). 
The  lawyer  saw  at  once  that  he  had  convicted  himself  of 
asking  a  question  that  he  already  knew.  In  his  embarrass- 
ment he  asks  another  question  to  show  that  he  did  have  some 
point  at  first:  And  who  is  my  neighbour?  {kai  tis  estin  mou 
plesion;).  The  Jews  split  hairs  over  this  question  and  ex- 
cluded from  "neighbour  "Gentiles  and  especially  Samaritans. 
So  here  was  his  loop-hole.  A  neighbour  is  a  nigh  dweller  to 
one,  but  the  Jews  made  racial  exceptions  as  many,  alas,  do 
today.  The  word  plesion  here  is  an  adverb  (neuter  of  the 
adjective  plesios)  meaning  ho  plesion  on  (the  one  who  is  near), 
but  on  was  usually  not  expressed  and  the  adverb  is  here  used 
as  if  a  substantive. 

30.  Made  answer  (hupolabon).  Second  aorist  active  parti- 
ciple of  hupolambanb  (see  7:43),  to  take  up  literally,  and  then 
in  thought  and  speech,  old  verb,  but  in  this  sense  of  inter- 
rupting in  talk  only  in  the  N.T.  Was  going  down  (katebainen). 
Imperfect  active  describing  the  journey.  Fell  among  robbers 
(leistais  periepesen).  Second  aorist  ingressive  active  indic- 
ative of  peripipto,  old  verb  with  associative  instrumental 
case,  to  fall  among  and  to  be  encompassed  by  (peri,  around), 
to  be  surrounded  by  robbers.  A  common  experience  to  this 
day  on  the  road  to  Jericho.  The  Romans  placed  a  fort  on 
this  "red  and  bloody  way."  These  were  bandits,  not  petty 
thieves.  Stripped  (ekdusantes).  Of  his  clothing  as  well  as 
of  his  money,  the  meanest  sort  of  robbers.  Beat  him  {plegas 
epithentes).     Second  aorist  active  participle  of  epitithemi, 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  153 

a  common  verb.  Literally,  "placing  strokes  or  blows" 
(plegas,  plagues)  upon  him.  See  Luke  12:48;  Acts  16:23; 
Rev.  15:1,  6,  8  for  "plagues."  Half-dead  (hemithane) .  Late 
word  from  hemi,  half,  and  thnesko,  to  die.  Only  here  in  the 
N.T.    Vivid  picture  of  the  robbery. 

31.  By  chance  (kata  sugkurian).  Here  only  in  the  N.T., 
meaning  rather,  "by  way  of  coincidence."  It  is  a  rare  word 
elsewhere  and  in  late  writers  like  Hippocrates.  It  is  from 
the  verb  sugkureo,  though  sugkuresis  is  more  common.  Was 
going  down  (katebainen) .  Imperfect  active  as  in  verse  30. 
Passed  by  on  the  other  side  (antipar  elthen) .  Second  aorist 
active  indicative  of  antiparerchomai,  a  late  double  compound 
here  (verses  31  and  32)  only  in  the  N.T.,  but  in  the  papyri 
and  late  writers.  It  is  the  ingressive  aorist  (elthen),  came 
alongside  (para),  and  then  he  stepped  over  to  the  opposite 
side  (anti)  of  the  road  to  avoid  ceremonial  contamination 
with  a  stranger.  A  vivid  and  powerful  picture  of  the  vice 
of  Jewish  ceremonial  cleanliness  at  the  cost  of  moral  princi- 
ple and  duty.  The  Levite  in  verse  32  behaved  precisely  as 
the  priest  had  done  and  for  the  same  reason. 

33.  A  certain  Samaritan  (Samareites  de  tis).  Of  all  men  in 
the  world  to  do  a  neighbourly  act!  As  he  journeyed  (hodeubn). 
Making  his  way.  Came  where  he  was  (elthen  kaf  auton). 
Literally,  "came  down  upon  him."  He  did  not  sidestep  or 
dodge  him,  but  had  compassion  on  him. 

34.  Bound  up  his  wounds  (katedesen  ta  traumata).  First 
aorist  active  indicative  of  katadeo,  old  verb,  but  here  only  in 
the  N.T.  The  verb  means  "bound  down."  We  say  "bind 
up."  Medical  detail  that  interested  Luke.  The  word 
for  "wounds"  (traumata)  here  only  in  the  N.T.  Pouring  on 
them  oil  and  wine  (epicheon  elaion  kai  oinon).  Old  verb  again, 
but  here  only  in  the  N.T.  Oil  and  wine  were  household 
remedies  even  for  wounds  (soothing  oil,  antiseptic  alcohol). 
Hippocrates  prescribed  for  ulcers:  "Bind  with  soft  wool, 
and  sprinkle  with  wine  and  oil."    Set  him  (epibibasas).    An 


154      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

old  verb  epibibazo  (epi,  bibazb),  to  cause  to  mount.  In  the 
N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  19:35;  23:24,  common  in  LXX. 
Beast  {ktenos).  Old  word  from  ktaomai,  to  acquire,  and  so 
property  {ktema)  especially  cattle  or  any  beast  of  burden. 
An  inn  {pandocheion).  The  old  Attic  form  was  pandokeion 
(from  pan,  all,  and  dechomai,  to  receive).  A  public  place  for 
receiving  all  comers  and  a  more  pretentious  caravanserai 
than  a  kataluma  like  that  in  Luke  2:7.  Here  only  in  the 
N.T.  There  are  ruins  of  two  inns  about  halfway  between 
Bethany  and  Jericho. 

35.  On  the  morrow  {epi  ten  aurion).  Towards  the  morrow 
as  in  Acts  4:5.  (Cf.  also  Acts  3:1).  Syriac  Sinaitic  has  it 
"at  dawn  of  the  day."  An  unusual  use  of  epi.  Took  out 
{ekbalbn).  Second  aorist  active  participle  of  ekballo.  It 
could  mean,  "fling  out,"  but  probably  only  means  "drew 
out."  Common  verb.  Two  pence  {duo  denaria).  About 
thirty-five  cents,  but  worth  more  in  purchasing  power.  To 
the  host  {toi  pandochei).  The  innkeeper.  Here  only  in  the 
N.T.  Whatsoever  thou  spendest  more  {hoti  an  prosdapaneseis). 
Indefinite  relative  clause  with  an  and  the  aorist  active  sub- 
junctive of  prosdapanao,  to  spend  besides  {pros),  a  late  verb 
for  the  common  prosanalisko  and  here  only  in  the  N.T.  / 
will  repay  {ego  apodoso).  Emphatic.  What  he  had  paid 
was  merely  by  way  of  pledge.  He  was  a  man  of  his  word 
and  known  to  the  innkeeper  as  reliable.  When  I  come  back 
again  {en  toi  epanerchesthai  me).  Luke's  favourite  idiom  of 
en  and  the  articular  infinitive  with  accusative  of  general 
reference.    Double  compound  verb  epanerchomai. 

36.  Proved  neighbour  to  him  that  fell  {plesion  gegonenai  tou 
empesontos).  Second  perfect  infinitive  of  ginomai  and  second 
aorist  active  participle  of  empipto.  Objective  genitive,  be- 
came neighbour  to  the  one,  etc.  Jesus  has  changed  the  law- 
yer's standpoint  and  has  put  it  up  to  him  to  decide  which  of 
"these  three"  {toutbn  ton  trion,  priest,  Levite,  Samaritan) 
acted  like  a  neighbour  to  the  wounded  man. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  155 

37.  On  him  {met!  autou).  With  him,  more  exactly.  The 
lawyer  saw  the  point  and  gave  the  correct  answer,  but  he 
gulped  at  the  word  "Samaritan"  and  refused  to  say  that. 
Do  thou  {su  poiei).  Emphasis  on  "thou."  Would  this  Jew- 
ish lawyer  act  the  neighbour  to  a  Samaritan?  This  parable 
of  the  Good  Samaritan  has  built  the  world's  hospitals  and, 
if  understood  and  practised,  will  remove  race  prejudice, 
national  hatred  and  war,  class  jealousy. 

38.  Now  as  they  went  on  their  way  {en  de  toi  poreuesthai 
autous).  Luke's  favourite  temporal  clause  again  as  in  verse 
35.  Received  him  into  her  house  {hupedexato  auton  eis  ten 
oikian).  Aorist  middle  indicative  of  hupodechomai,  an  old 
verb  to  welcome  as  a  guest  (in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke 
19:6;  Acts  17:7;  James  2:25).  Martha  is  clearly  the  mistress 
of  the  home  and  is  probably  the  elder  sister.  There  is  no 
evidence  that  she  was  the  wife  of  Simon  the  leper  (John 
I2:if.).  It  is  curious  that  in  an  old  cemetery  at  Bethany  the 
names  of  Martha,  Eleazar,  and  Simon  have  been  found. 

39.  Which  also  sat  {he  kai  parakathestheisa).  First  aorist 
passive  participle  of  parakathezomai,  an  old  verb,  but  only 
here  in  the  N.T.  It  means  to  sit  beside  {para)  and  pros 
means  right  in  front  of  the  feet  of  Jesus.  It  is  not  clear 
what  the  point  is  in  kai  here.  It  may  mean  that  Martha 
loved  to  sit  here  also  as  well  as  Mary.  Heard  {ekouen). 
Imperfect  active.  She  took  her  seat  by  the  feet  of  Jesus 
and  went  on  listening  to  his  talk. 

40.  Was  cumbered  {periespdtd).  Imperfect  passive  of 
perispao,  an  old  verb  with  vivid  metaphor,  to  draw  around. 
One  has  sometimes  seen  women  whose  faces  are  literally 
drawn  round  with  anxiety,  with  a  permanent  twist,  dis- 
tracted in  mind  and  in  looks.  She  came  up  to  him  {epistasa). 
Second  aorist  active  participle  of  ephistemi,  an  old  verb  to 
place  upon,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  in  the  middle  voice  or  the 
intransitive  tenses  of  the  active  (perfect  and  second  aorist 
as  here).    It  is  the  ingressive  aorist  here  and  really  meass. 


156      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

stepping  up  to  or  bursting  in  or  upon  Jesus.  It  is  an  explosive 
act  as  is  the  speech  of  Martha.  Dost  thou  not  care  (ou  melei 
soi).  This  was  a  reproach  to  Jesus  for  monopolizing  Mary 
to  Martha's  hurt.  Did  leave  me  {me  kateleipen).  Imperfect 
active,  she  kept  on  leaving  me.  Bid  her  (eipon  autei).  Late 
form  instead  of  eipe,  second  aorist  active  imperative,  com- 
mon in  the  papyri.  Martha  feels  that  Jesus  is  the  key  to 
Mary's  help.  That  she  help  me  (hina  moi  sunantilabetai) . 
Sub-final  use  of  hina  with  second  aorist  middle  subjunctive 
of  sunantilambanomai,  a  double  compound  verb  (sun,  with, 
anti,  at  her  end  of  the  line,  and  lambanomai,  middle  voice  of 
lambano,  to  take  hold),  a  late  compound  appearing  in  the 
LXX,  Diodorus  and  Josephus.  Deissmann  (Light  from  the 
Ancient  East,  p.  87)  finds  it  in  many  widely  scattered  inscrip- 
tions "throughout  the  whole  extent  of  the  Hellenistic  world 
of  the  Mediterranean."  It  appears  only  twice  in  the  N.T. 
(here  and  Rom.  8:26).  It  is  a  beautiful  word,  to  take  hold 
oneself  (middle  voice)  at  his  end  of  the  task  (anti)  together 
with  (sun)  one. 

41.  Art  anxious  (merimnais).  An  old  verb  for  worry  and 
anxiety  from  merizb  (meris,  part)  to  be  divided,  distracted. 
Jesus  had  warned  against  this  in  the  Sermon  on  the  Mount 
(Matt.  6:25,  28,  31,  34.  See  also  Luke  12:11,  22,  26).  And 
troubled  (kai  thorubazei).  From  thorubazomai,  a  verb  found 
nowhere  else  so  far.  Many  MSS.  here  have  the  usual  form 
turbazei,  from  turbazo.  Apparently  from  thorubos,  a  common 
enough  word  for  tumult.  Martha  had  both  inward  anxiety 
and  outward  agitation.  But  one  thing  is  needful  (henos  de 
estin  chreia).  This  is  the  reading  of  A  C  and  may  be  correct. 
A  few  manuscripts  have:  "There  is  need  of  few  things." 
Aleph  B  L  (and  Westcott  and  Hort)  have:  "There  is  need 
of  few  things  or  one,"  which  seems  like  a  conflate  reading 
though  the  readings  are  all  old.  See  Robertson,  Introduction 
to  Textual  Criticism  of  the  N.T.,  p.  190.  Jesus  seems  to 
say  to  Martha  that  only  one  dish  was  really  necessary  for 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  157 

the  meal  instead  of  the  "many"  about  which  she  was  so 
anxious. 

42.  The  good  portion  {ten  agathen  merida).  The  best  dish 
on  the  table,  fellowship  with  Jesus.  This  is  the  spiritual 
application  of  the  metaphor  of  the  dishes  on  the  table. 
Salvation  is  not  "the  good  portion"  for  Martha  had  that 
also.  From  her  {antes).  Ablative  case  after  aphairethesetai 
(future  passive  indicative).  Jesus  pointedly  takes  Mary's 
side  against  Martha's  fussiness. 


CHAPTER  XI 

I.  As  he  was  praying  in  a  certain  place  {en  toi  einai  auton 
en  topoi  tini  proseuchomenon).  Characteristically  Lukan 
idiom:  en  with  articular  periphrastic  infinitive  {einai  pros- 
euchomenon) with  accusative  of  general  reference  {auton). 
That.  Not  in  the  Greek,  asyndeton  {kai  egeneto  eipen). 
When  he  ceased  {hos  epausato).  Supply  proseuchomenos 
(praying),  complementary  or  supplementary  participle. 
Teach  us  {didaxon  hemas).  Jesus  had  taught  them  by  pre- 
cept (Matt.  6:7-15)  and  example  (Luke  9:29).  Somehow 
the  example  of  Jesus  on  this  occasion  stirred  them  to  fresh 
interest  in  the  subject  and  to  revival  of  interest  in  John's 
teachings  (Luke  5:33).  So  Jesus  gave  them  the  substance 
of  the  Model  Prayer  in  Matthew,  but  in  shorter  form.  Some 
of  the  MSS.  have  one  or  all  of  the  phrases  in  Matthew,  but 
the  oldest  documents  have  it  in  the  simplest  form.  See  on 
Matt.  6:7-15  for  discussion  of  these  details  (Father,  hal- 
lowed, kingdom,  daily  bread,  forgiveness,  bringing  us  into 
temptation).  In  Matt.  6:11  "give"  is  dos  (second  aorist 
active  imperative  second  singular,  a  single  act)  while  here 
Luke  11:3  "give"  is  didou  (present  active  imperative,  both 
from  didbmi)  and  means,  "keep  on  giving."  So  in  Luke 
11  :\  we  have  "For  we  ourselves  also  forgive"  {kai  gar  autoi 
aphiomen),  present  active  indicative  of  the  late  0  verb  aphid 
while  Matt.  6:12  has  "as  we  also  forgave"  {hos  kai  hemeis 
aphekamen),  first  aorist  {k  aorist)  active  of  aphiemi.  So 
also  where  Matt.  6:12  has  "debts"  {ta  opheilemata)  Luke 
11:4  has  "sins"  {tas  hamartias).  But  the  spirit  of  each 
prayer  is  the  same.  There  is  no  evidence  that  Jesus  meant 
either  form  to  be  a  ritual.  In  both  Matt.  6:13  and  Luke 
11:4  me  eisenegkeis  occurs  (second  aorist  subjunctive  with 

158 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  159 

me  in  prohibition,  ingressive  aorist).  "Bring  us  not"  is  a 
better  translation  than  "lead  us  not."  There  is  no  such 
thing  as  God  enticing  one  to  sin  (James  1:13).  Jesus  urges 
us  to  pray  not  to  be  tempted  as  in  Luke  22:40  in  Geth- 
semane. 

5.  At  midnight  (mesonuktiou).  Genitive  of  time.  And 
say  to  him  (kai  eipei  autoi).  This  is  the  deliberative  sub- 
junctive, but  it  is  preceded  by  two  future  indicatives  that 
are  deliberative  also  (hexei,  poreusetai).  Lend  me  (chreson 
moi).  First  aorist  active  imperative  second  singular.  Lend 
me  now.  From  kichremi,  an  old  verb,  to  lend  as  a  matter  of 
friendly  interest  as  opposed  to  daneizo,  to  lend  on  interest  as 
a  business.    Only  here  in  the  N.T. 

6.  To  set  before  him  {ho  paratheso  autoi).  Which  I  shall 
place  beside  him.  Future  active  of  paratithemi.  See  9:16  for 
this  same  verb. 

7.  And  he  (kakeinos).  Emphatic.  Shall  say  (eipei). 
Still  the  aorist  active  deliberative  subjunctive  as  in  verse  5 
(the  same  long  and  somewhat  involved  sentence).  Trouble 
me  not  (me  moi  kopous  pareche).  Me  and  the  present  im- 
perative active.  Literally,  "  Stop  furnishing  troubles  to  me." 
On  this  use  of  kopous  parecho  see  also  Matt.  26:10;  Mark 
14:6;  Gal.  6:17  and  the  singular  kopon,  Luke  18:5.  The  door 
is  now  shut  (ede  he  thura  kekleistai).  Perfect  passive  indica- 
tive, shut  to  stay  shut.  Oriental  locks  are  not  easy  to  un- 
lock. From  kleio,  common  verb.  In  bed  (eis  ten  koiten). 
Note  use  of  eis  in  sense  of  en.  Often  a  whole  family  would 
sleep  in  the  same  room.  I  cannot  (ou  dunamai) .  That  is,  I 
am  not  willing. 

8.  Though  (ei  kai).  Kai  ei  would  be  "Even  if,"  a  different 
idea.  Because  he  is  his  friend  (dia  to  einai  philon  autou).  Dia 
and  the  accusative  articular  infinitive  with  accusative  of 
general  reference,  a  causal  clause  =  "  because  of  the  being  a 
friend  of  his."  Yet  because  of  his  importunity  (dia  ge  ten 
anaidian  autou).    From  anaides,  shameless,  and  that  from  a 


160      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

privative  and  aidos,  shame,  shamelessness,  impudence.  An 
old  word,  but  here  alone  in  the  N.T.  Examples  in  the 
papyri.  The  use  of  ge  here,  one  of  the  intensive  particles, 
is  to  be  noted.  It  sharpens  the  contrast  to  "though"  by 
"yet."  As  examples  of  importunate  prayer  Vincent  notes 
Abraham  in  behalf  of  Sodom  (Gen.  18:23-33)  and  the  Syro- 
Phoenician  woman  in  behalf  of  her  daughter  (Matt.  15:22- 
28). 

9.  Shall  be  opened  (anoigesetai).  Second  future  passive 
third  singular  of  anoignumi  and  the  later  anoigb. 

11.  Of  which  of  you  that  is  a  father  (tina  de  ex  humon  ton 
patera).  There  is  a  decided  anacoluthon  here.  The  MSS. 
differ  a  great  deal.  The  text  of  Westcott  and  Hort  makes 
ton  patera  (the  father)  in  apposition  with  tina  (of  whom)  and 
in  the  accusative  the  object  of  aitesei  (shall  ask)  which  has 
also  another  accusative  (both  person  and  thing)  "a  loaf," 
So  far  so  good.  But  the  rest  of  the  sentence  is,  will  ye  give 
him  a  stone?  (me  lithon  epidbsei  autbi;).  Me  shows  that  the 
answer  No  is  expected,  but  the  trouble  is  that  the  interrog- 
ative tina  in  the  first  clause  is  in  the  accusative  the  object 
of  aitesei  while  here  the  same  man  (he)  is  the  subject  of  epi- 
dosei. It  is  a  very  awkward  piece  of  Greek  and  yet  it  is  in- 
telligible. Some  of  the  old  MSS.  do  not  have  the  part  about 
"loaf"  and  "stone,"  but  only  the  two  remaining  parts  about 
"fish"  and  "serpent,"  "egg"  and  "scorpion."  The  same 
difficult  construction  is  carried  over  into  these  questions  also. 

13.  Know  how  to  give  (oidate  didonai).  See  on  Matt.  7:11 
for  this  same  saying.  Only  here  Jesus  adds  the  Holy  Spirit 
(pneuma  hagion)  as  the  great  gift  (the  summum  bonum)  that 
the  Father  is  ready  to  bestow.  Jesus  is  fond  of  "how  much 
more"  (posbi  mdllon,  by  how  much  more,  instrumental  case). 

14.  When  (tou  daimoniou  exelthontos).  Genitive  absolute 
and  asyndeton  between  kai  egeneto  and  elalesen  as  often  in 
Luke  (no  hoti  or  kai). 

15.  Dumb  (kbphon).     See  on  Matt.  9:32.     By  Beelzebub 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  161 

(en  Beezeboul).  Blasphemous  accusation  here  in  Judea  as  in 
Galilee  (Mark  3  :22  =Matt.  12:24,  27).  See  on  Matthew  for 
discussion  of  the  form  of  this  name  and  the  various  items  in 
the  sin  against  the  Holy  Spirit  involved  in  the  charge.  It 
was  useless  to  deny  the  fact  of  the  miracles.  So  they  were 
explained  as  wrought  by  Satan  himself,  a  most  absurd  ex- 
planation. 

16.  Tempting  him  (peirazontes).  These  "others"  (heteroi) 
apparently  realized  the  futility  of  the  charge  of  being  in 
league  with  Beelzebub.  Hence  they  put  up  to  Jesus  the 
demand  for  "a  sign  from  heaven"  just  as  had  been  done  in 
Galilee  (Matt.  12:38).  By  "sign"  (semeion)  they  meant  a 
great  spectacular  display  of  heavenly  power  such  as  they 
expected  the  Messiah  to  give  and  such  as  the  devil  suggested 
to  Jesus  on  the  pinnacle  of  the  temple.  Sought  (ezetoun). 
Imperfect  active,  kept  on  seeking. 

17.  But  he  (autos  de).  In  contrast  with  them.  Knowing 
their  thoughts  (eidos  auton  ta  dianoemata).  From  dianoeo, 
to  think  through  or  distinguish.  This  substantive  is  com- 
mon in  Plato,  but  occurs  nowhere  else  in  the  N.T.  It  means 
intent,  purpose.  Jesus  knew  that  they  were  trying  to  tempt 
him.  And  a  house  divided  against  a  house  falleth  (kai  oikos 
epi  oikon  piptei).  It  is  not  certain  that  diameristheisa 
(divided)  is  to  be  repeated  here  as  in  Matt.  12:25  =  Mark 
3:25.  It  may  mean,  and  house  falls  upon  house,  "one  tum- 
bling house  knocking  down  its  neighbour,  a  graphic  picture  of 
what  happens  when  a  kingdom  is  divided  against  itself" 
(Bruce). 

18.  Because  ye  say  (hoti  legete).  Jesus  here  repeats  in  in- 
direct discourse  (accusative  and  infinitive)  the  charge  made 
against  him  in  verse  15.  The  condition  is  of  the  first  class, 
determined  as  fulfilled. 

19.  And  if  I  by  Beelzebub  (ei  de  ego  en  Beezeboul).  Also  a 
condition  of  the  first  class,  determined  as  fulfilled.  A  Greek 
condition  deals  only  with  the  statement,  not  with  the  actual 


1 62      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

facts.  For  sake  of  argument,  Jesus  here  assumes  that  he 
casts  out  demons  by  Beelzebub.  The  conclusion  is  a  re- 
ductio  ad  absurdum.  The  Jewish  exorcists  practiced  incanta- 
tions against  demons  (Acts  19:13). 

20.  By  the  finger  of  God  {en  daktuloi  theou).  In  distinction 
from  the  Jewish  exorcists.  Matt.  12:28  has  "by  the  Spirit 
of  God."  Then  is  come  (ara  ephthasen).  Phthano  in  late 
Greek  comes  to  mean  simply  to  come,  not  to  come  before. 
The  aorist  indicative  tense  here  is  timeless.  Note  ara  (ac- 
cordingly) in  the  conclusion  (apodosis). 

21.  Fully  armed  (kathoplismenos).  Perfect  passive  par- 
ticiple of  kathoplizo,  an  old  verb,  but  here  only  in  the  N.T. 
Note  perfective  use  of  kata  in  composition  with  hoplizo, 
to  arm  (from  hopla,  arms).  Note  indefinite  temporal  clause 
(hotan  and  present  subjunctive  phulassei).  His  own  court 
(ten  heautou  aulen).  His  own  homestead.  Mark  3:27  = 
Matt.  12:29  has  "house"  (oikian).  Aule  is  used  in  the 
N.T.  in  various  senses  (the  court  in  front  of  the  house,  the 
court  around  which  the  house  is  built,  then  the  house  as  a 
whole).  His  goods  (ta hup archonta autou) .  "His  belongings." 
Neuter  plural  present  active  participle  of  huparcho  used  as 
substantive  with  genitive. 

22.  But  when  (epan  de).  Note  hotan  in  verse  21.  Stronger 
than  he  (ischuroteros  autou).  Comparative  of  ischuros  fol- 
lowed by  the  ablative.  Come  upon  him  and  overcome  him 
(epelthbn  nikesei  auton).  Second  aorist  active  participle  of 
eperchomai  and  first  aorist  active  subjunctive  of  nikao. 
Aorist  tense  here  because  a  single  onset  while  in  verse  22  the 
guarding  (phulassei,  present  active  subjunctive)  is  contin- 
uous. His  whole  armour  (ten  panoplian  autou).  An  old  and 
common  word  for  all  the  soldier's  outfit  (shield,  sword, 
lance,  helmet,  greaves,  breastplate).  Tyndale  renders  it 
"his  harness."  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Eph.  6:11,  13 
where  the  items  are  given.  Wherein  he  trusted  (epK  hei 
epepoithei) .    Second  past  perfect  active  of  peitho,  to  persuade. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  163 

The  second  perfect  pepoitha  is  intransitive,  to  trust.  Old 
and  common  verb.  He  trusted  his  weapons  which  had  been 
so  efficacious.  His  spoils  (ta  skula  anion).  It  is  not  clear  to 
what  this  figure  refers.  Strong  as  Satan  is  Jesus  is  stronger 
and  wins  victories  over  him  as  he  was  doing  then.  In  Col. 
2:15  Christ  is  pictured  as  triumphing  openly  over  the  pow- 
ers of  evil  by  the  Cross. 

23.  He  that  is  not  with  me  (ho  me  on  met  emou).  This  verse 
is  just  like  Matt.  12:30. 

24.  And  finding  none  (kai  me  heuriskon).  Here  Matt. 
12:43  has  kai  ouch  heuriskei  (present  active  indicative  instead 
of  present  active  participle).  Luke  11 124-26  is  almost  ver- 
batim like  Matt.  12:43-45,  which  see.  Instead  of  just  "tak- 
eth"  (paralambanei)  in  verse  26,  Matthew  has  "taketh  with 
himself"  (paralambanei  metK  heautou).  And  Luke  omits: 
"Even  so  shall  it  be  also  unto  this  evil  generation"  of  Matt. 
12:45.  Than  the  first  (ton  proton).  Ablative  case  after  the 
comparative  cheirona.  The  seven  demons  brought  back 
remind  one  of  the  seven  that  afflicted  Mary  Magdalene 
(Luke  8:2). 

27.  As  he  said  these  things  (en  tbi  legein  auton).  Luke's 
common  idiom,  en  with  articular  infinitive.  Verses  27  and 
28  are  peculiar  to  Luke.  His  Gospel  in  a  special  sense  is  the 
Gospel  of  Woman.  This  woman  "speaks  well,  but  wom- 
anly" (Bengel).  Her  beatitude  (makaria)  reminds  us  of 
Elisabeth's  words  (Luke  1:42,  eulogemene).  She  is  fulfilling 
Mary's  own  prophecy  in  1 148  (makariousin  me,  shall  call  me 
happy). 

28.  But  he  said  (autos  de  eipen).  Jesus  in  contrast  turns 
attention  to  others  and  gives  them  a  beatitude  (makarioi). 
"The  originality  of  Christ's  reply  guarantees  its  historical 
character.  Such  a  comment  is  beyond  the  reach  of  an  in- 
ventor" (Plummer). 

29.  Were  gathering  together  unto  him  (epathroizomenon). 
Genitive  absolute  present  middle  participle  of  epathroizo, 


164      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

a  rare  verb,  Plutarch  and  here  only  in  the  N.T.,  from  epi 
and  athroizo  (a  common  enough  verb).  It  means  to  throng 
together  (athroos,  in  throngs).  Vivid  picture  of  the  crowds 
around  Jesus.  But  the  sign  of  Jonah  (ei  me  to  semeion  Iona). 
Luke  does  not  give  here  the  burial  and  resurrection  of  Jesus 
of  which  Jonah's  experience  in  the  big  fish  was  a  type  (Matt. 
i2:39fT.),  but  that  is  really  implied  (Plummer  argues)  by  the 
use  here  of  "shall  be  given"  (dothesetai)  and  "shall  be" 
(estai),  for  the  resurrection  of  Jesus  is  still  future.  The 
preaching  of  Jesus  ought  to  have  been  sign  enough  as  in  the 
case  of  Jonah,  but  the  resurrection  will  be  given.  Luke's  re- 
port is  much  briefer  and  omits  what  is  in  Matt.  12:41. 

3 1 .  With  the  men  of  this  generation  (meta  ton  andrbn  tes 
geneas  tautes).  Here  Matt.  12:42  has  simply  "with  this  gen- 
eration," which  see. 

32.  At  the  preaching  of  Jonah  (eis  to  kerugma  Iona).  Note 
this  use  of  eis  as  in  Matt.  10:41  and  12:41.  Luke  inserts  the 
words  about  the  Queen  of  the  South  (31)  in  between  the  dis- 
cussion of  Jonah  (verses  29L,  32).  Both  Solomonos  (31)  and 
Iona  (verse  32)  are  in  the  ablative  case  after  the  comparative 
pleion  (more,  something  more). 

33.  In  a  cellar  {eis  krupten).  A  crypt  (same  word)  or 
hidden  place  from  krupto,  to  hide.  Late  and  rare  word  and 
here  only  in  the  N.T.  These  other  words  (lamp,  luchnon, 
bushel,  modion,  stand,  luchnian)  have  all  been  discussed  pre- 
viously (Matt.  5:15).  Luke  11:33  is  uke  Matt.  6:221.,  which 
see  for  details. 

35.  Whether  not  (me).  This  use  of  me  in  an  indirect  ques- 
tion is  good  Greek  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1045).  It  is  a 
pitiful  situation  if  the  very  light  is  darkness.  This  happens 
when  the  eye  of  the  soul  is  too  diseased  to  see  the  light  of 
Christ. 

36.  With  its  bright  shining  (tei  astrapei).  Instrumental 
case,  as  if  by  a  flash  of  lightning  the  light  is  revealed  in  him. 
See  on  10:18. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  165 

37.  Now  as  he  spake  {en  de  tbi  lalesai).  Luke's  common 
idiom,  en  with  the  articular  infinitive  (aorist  active  infinitive) 
but  it  does  not  mean  "after  he  had  spoken"  as  Plummer 
argues,  but  simply  "in  the  speaking,"  no  time  in  the  aorist 
infinitive.  See  3:21  for  similar  use  of  aorist  infinitive  with 
en.  Asketh  (erotdi).  Present  active  indicative,  dramatic 
present.  Request,  not  question.  To  dine  {hopos  aristesei). 
Note  hopos  rather  than  the  common  hina.  Aorist  active 
subjunctive  rather  than  present,  for  a  single  meal.  The 
verb  is  from  ariston  (breakfast).  See  distinction  between 
ariston  and  deipnon  (dinner  or  supper)  in  Luke  14:12.  It  is 
the  morning  meal  (breakfast  or  lunch)  after  the  return  from 
morning  prayers  in  the  synagogue  (Matt.  22:4),  not  the 
very  early  meal  called  akratisma.  The  verb  is,  however, 
used  for  the  early  meal  on  the  seashore  in  John  21:12,  15. 
With  him  {par1  autbi).  By  his  side.  Sat  down  to  meat  {anepe- 
sen).  Second  aorist  active  indicative  of  anapipto,  old  verb,  to 
recline,  to  fall  back  on  the  sofa  or  lounge.  No  word  here  for 
"to  meat." 

38.  That  he  had  not  first  washed  before  dinner  {hoti  ou  proton 
ebaptisthe  pro  tou  aristou).  The  verb  is  first  aorist  passive 
indicative  of  baptizo,  to  dip  or  to  immerse.  Here  it  is  applied 
to  the  hands.  It  was  the  Jewish  custom  to  dip  the  hands  in 
water  before  eating  and  often  between  courses  for  ceremonial 
purification.  In  Galilee  the  Pharisees  and  scribes  had 
sharply  criticized  the  disciples  for  eating  with  unwashed 
hands  (Mark  7:1-23  =  Matt.  15:1-20)  when  Jesus  had  de- 
fended their  liberty  and  had  opposed  making  a  necessity  of 
such  a  custom  (tradition)  in  opposition  to  the  command  of 
God.  Apparently  Jesus  on  this  occasion  had  himself  re- 
clined at  the  breakfast  (not  dinner)  without  this  ceremonial 
dipping  of  the  hands  in  water.  The  Greek  has  "first  before" 
{proton  pro),  a  tautology  not  preserved  in  the  translation. 

39.  The  Lord  {ho  kurios).  The  Lord  Jesus  plainly  and  in 
the  narrative  portion  of  Luke.    Now  {nun).    Probably  refers 


1 66      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

to  him.  You  Pharisees  do  now  what  was  formerly  done. 
The  platter  (tou  pinakos).  The  dish.  Old  word,  rendered 
"the  charger"  in  Matt.  14:8.  Another  word  for  "platter" 
(paropsis)  in  Matt.  23:25  means  "side-dish."  But  your 
inward  part  {to  de  esbthen  humon).  The  part  within  you 
(Pharisees).  They  keep  the  external  regulations,  but  their 
hearts  are  full  of  plunder  (harpages,  from  harpazo,  to  seize) 
and  wickedness  (ponerias,  from  poneros,  evil  man).  See 
Matt.  23  :25  for  a  like  indictment  of  the  Pharisees  for  care 
for  the  outside  of  the  cup  but  neglect  of  what  is  on  the 
inside.  Both  inside  and  outside  should  be  clean,  but  the 
inside  first. 

40.  Howbeit  (plen).  See  Luke  6:24.  Instead  of  devoting 
so  much  attention  to  the  outside.  Those  things  which  are 
within  (ta  enonta).  Articular  neuter  plural  participle  from 
eneimi,  to  be  in,  common  verb.  This  precise  phrase  only 
here  in  the  N.T.  though  in  the  papyri,  and  it  is  not  clear 
what  it  means.  Probably,  give  as  alms  the  things  within  the 
dishes,  that  is  have  inward  righteousness  with  a  brotherly 
spirit  and  the  outward  becomes  "clean"  (kathara).  Properly 
understood,  this  is  not  irony  and  is  not  Ebionism,  but  good 
Christianity    (Plummer). 

42.  Tithe  (apodekatoute).  Late  verb  for  the  more  common 
dekateuo.  So  in  Matt.  23:23.  Take  a  tenth  off  (apo-).  Rue 
(peganon).  Botanical  term  in  late  writers  from  pegnumi,  to 
make  fast  because  of  its  thick  leaves.  Here  Matt.  23 :23  has 
"anise."  Every  herb  (pan  lachanon).  General  term  as  in 
Mark4:32.  Matthew  has  "cummin."  Passby  (parerchesthe). 
Present  middle  indicative  of  parerchomai,  common  verb,  to 
go  by  or  beside.  Matt.  23:23  has  "ye  have  left  undone" 
(aphekate).  Luke  here  has  "love"  (agapen),  not  in  Matthew. 
Ought  (edei).  As  in  Matthew.  Imperfect  of  a  present  obliga- 
tion, not  lived  up  to  just  like  our  "ought"  (owed,  not  paid). 
Pareinai,  as  in  Matthew,  the  second  aorist  active  infinitive 
of  abhiemi.  to  leave  off.    Common  verb.    Luke  does  not  have 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  167 

the  remark  about  straining  out  the  gnat  and  swallowing  the 
camel  (Matt.  23:34).  It  is  plain  that  the  terrible  exposure 
of  the  scribes  and  Pharisees  in  Matt.  23  in  the  temple  was 
simply  the  culmination  of  previous  conflicts  such  as  this  one. 

43.  The  chief  seats  in  the  synagogues  {ten  protokathedrian 
en  tais  sunagogais).  Singular  here,  plural  in  Matt.  23:6. 
This  semi-circular  bench  faced  the  congregation.  Matt. 
23 :6  has  also  the  chief  place  at  feasts  given  by  Luke  also  in 
that  discourse  (20:46)  as  well  as  in  14:7,  a  marked  character- 
istic of  the  Pharisees. 

44.  The  tombs  which  appear  not  {ta  mneneia  ta  adela). 
These  hidden  graves  would  give  ceremonial  defilement  for 
seven  days  (Num.  19:16).  Hence  they  were  usually  white- 
washed as  a  warning.  So  in  Matt.  23  127  the  Pharisees  are 
called  "whited  sepulchres."  Men  do  not  know  how  rotten 
they  are.  The  word  adelos  {a  privative  and  delos,  apparent 
or  plain)  occurs  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  I  Cor.  14:8, 
though  an  old  and  common  word.  Here  men  walking  around 
{peripatountes)  walk  over  the  tombs  without  knowing  it. 
These  three  woes  cut  to  the  quick  and  evidently  made  the 
Pharisees  wince. 

45.  Thou  reproachest  us  also  {kai  hemas  hubrizeis).  Be- 
cause the  lawyers  (scribes)  were  usually  Pharisees.  The 
verb  hubrizo  is  an  old  one  and  common  for  outrageous  treat- 
ment, a  positive  insult  (so  Luke  18:32;  Matt.  22:6;  Acts 
14:5;  I  Thess.  2:2).  So  Jesus  proceeds  to  give  the  lawyers 
three  woes  as  he  had  done  to  the  Pharisees. 

46.  Grievous  to  be  borne  {dusbastakta) .  A  late  word  in  LXX 
and  Plutarch  {dus  and  bastazo).  Here  alone  in  text  of  West- 
cott  and  Hort  who  reject  it  in  Matt.  23  14  where  we  have 
"heavy  burdens"  {phortia  bared).  In  Gal.  6:2  we  have  bare 
with  a  distinction  drawn.  Here  we  have  phortizete  (here  only 
in  the  N.T.  and  Matt.  11:28)  for  "lade,"  phortia  as  cognate 
accusative  and  then  phortiois  (dative  after  ou  prospsauete, 
touch  not).     It  is  a  fierce  indictment  of  scribes  (lawyers)  for 


l68      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

their  pettifogging  interpretations  of  the  written  law  in  their 
oral  teaching  (later  written  down  as  Mishna  and  then  as 
Gemarah),  a  terrible  load  which  these  lawyers  did  not  pretend 
to  carry  themselves,  not  even  "with  one  of  their  fingers"  to 
"touch"  (prospsauo,  old  verb  but  only  here  in  the  N.T.), 
touch  with  the  view  to  remove.  Matt.  23  :\  has  kinesai, 
to  move.  A  physician  would  understand  the  meaning  of 
prospauo  for  feeling  gently  a  sore  spot  or  the  pulse. 

48.  Consent  (suneudokeite).  Double  compound  (sun,  eu, 
dokeo),  to  think  well  along  with  others,  to  give  full  approval. 
A  late  verb,  several  times  in  the  N.T.,  in  Acts  8:1  of  Saul's 
consenting  to  and  agreeing  to  Stephen's  death.  It  is  a  some- 
what subtle,  but  just,  argument  made  here.  Outwardly  the 
lawyers  build  tombs  for  the  prophets  whom  their  fathers 
(forefathers)  killed  as  if  they  disapproved  what  their  fathers 
did.  But  in  reality  they  neglect  and  oppose  what  the  proph- 
ets teach  just  as  their  fathers  did.  So  they  are  "witnes- 
ses" (martures)  against  themselves  (Matt.  23:31). 

49.  The  wisdom  of  God  (he  sophia  tou  theou).  In  Matt. 
23  134  Jesus  uses  "I  send"  (ego  apostellb)  without  this  phrase 
"the  wisdom  of  God."  There  is  no  book  to  which  it  can 
refer.  Jesus  is  the  wisdom  of  God  as  Paul  shows  (I  Cor. 
1:30),  but  it  is  hardly  likely  that  he  so  describes  himself 
here.  Probably  he  means  that  God  in  his  wisdom  said,  but 
even  so  "Jesus  here  speaks  with  confident  knowledge  of  the 
Divine  counsels"  (Plummer).  See  Luke  10:22;  15:7,  10. 
Here  the  future  tense  occurs,  "I  will  send"  (apostelo).  Some 
of  them  (ex  autbri).  No  "some"  (tinas)  in  the  Greek,  but 
understood.  They  will  act  as  their  fathers  did.  They  will 
kill  and  persecute. 

50.  That  .  .  .  may  be  required  (hina  .  .  .  ekzetethei).  Di- 
vinely ordered  sequence,  first  aorist  passive  subjunctive  of 
ekzeteo,  a  late  and  rare  verb  outside  of  LXX  and  N.T.,  re- 
quiring as  a  debt  the  blood  of  the  prophets.  Which  was  shed 
(to  ekkechumenon).    Perfect  passive  participle  of  ekcheb  and 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  169 

ekchunno  (an  Aeolic  form  appearing  in  the  margin  of  Westcott 
and  Hort  here,  ekchunnomenon,  present  passive  participle). 
If  the  present  passive  is  accepted,  it  means  the  blood  which 
is  perpetually  shed  from  time  to  time.  From  the  foundation 
of  the  world  (apo  kataboles  kosmou).  See  also  Matt.  25:34; 
John  17:24;  Eph.  1:4,  etc.  It  is  a  bold  metaphor  for  the 
purpose  of  God. 

51.  From  the  blood  of  Abel  to  the  blood  of  Zachariah  {apo 
haimatos  Abel  heos  haimatos  Zachariou).  The  blood  of  Abel 
is  the  first  shed  in  the  Old  Testament  (Gen.  4:10),  that  of 
Zacharias  the  last  in  the  O.T.  canon  which  ended  with 
Chronicles  (II  Chron.  24:22).  Chronologically  the  murder 
of  Uriah  by  Jehoiakim  was  later  (Jer.  26:23),  but  this  climax 
is  from  Genesis  to  II  Chronicles  (the  last  book  in  the  canon). 
See  on  Matt.  23:35  for  discussion  of  Zachariah  as  "the  son 
of  Barachiah"  rather  than  "the  son  of  Jehoiada."  Between 
the  altar  and  the  sanctuary  (metaxu  tou  thusiasteriou  kai  tou 
oikou).  Literally,  between  the  altar  and  the  house  (Matt. 
23:35  has  temple,  naou). 

52.  Ye  took  away  the  key  of  knowledge  (erate  ten  kleida  tes 
gnoseos).  First  aorist  active  indicative  of  airo,  common 
verb.  But  this  is  a  flat  charge  of  obscurantism  on  the  part 
of  these  scribes  (lawyers),  the  teachers  (rabbis)  of  the  people. 
They  themselves  (autoi)  refused  to  go  into  the  house  of 
knowledge  (beautiful  figure)  and  learn.  They  then  locked 
the  door  and  hid  the  key  to  the  house  of  knowledge  and 
hindered  (ekolusate,  effective  aorist  active)  those  who  were 
trying  to  enter  (tons  eiserchomenous,  present  participle, 
conative  action).  It  is  the  most  pitiful  picture  imaginable 
of  blind  ecclesiastics  trying  to  keep  others  as  blind  as  they 
were,  blind  leaders  of  the  blind,  both  falling  into  the  pit. 

53.  From  thence  (kakeithen).  Out  of  the  Pharisee's  house. 
What  became  of  the  breakfast  we  are  not  told,  but  the  rage 
of  both  Pharisees  and  lawyers  knew  no  bounds.  To  press 
upon  him  (enechein).    An  old  Greek  verb  to  hold  in,  to  be 


I70      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

enraged  at,  to  have  it  in  for  one.  It  is  the  same  verb  used 
of  the  relentless  hatred  of  Herodias  for  John  the  Baptist 
(Mark  6:19).  To  provoke  him  to  speak  (apostomatizein) .  From 
apo  and  stoma  (mouth).  Plato  uses  it  of  repeating  to  a  pupil 
for  him  to  recite  from  memory,  then  to  recite  by  heart 
(Plutarch).  Here  (alone  in  the  N.T.)  the  verb  means  to 
ply  with  questions,  to  entice  to  answers,  to  catechize.  Of 
many  things  {peri  pleionbn).  "Concerning  more  (compara- 
tive) things."  They  were  stung  to  the  quick  by  these  woes 
which  laid  bare  their  hollow  hypocrisy. 

54.  Laying  wait  for  him  (enedreuontes  auton).  An  old 
verb  from  en  and  hedra,  a  seat,  so  to  lie  in  ambush  for  one. 
Here  only  and  Acts  23  :2i  in  the  N.T.  Vivid  picture  of  the 
anger  of  these  rabbis  who  were  treating  Jesus  as  if  he  were 
a  beast  of  prey.  To  catch  something  out  of  his  mouth  {thereu- 
sai  to  ek  tou  stomatos  autou).  An  old  Greek  verb,  though 
here  only  in  the  N.T.,  from  thera  (cf.  Rom.  11 19),  to  ensnare, 
to  catch  in  hunting,  to  hunt.  These  graphic  words  from  the 
chase  show  the  rage  of  the  rabbis  toward  Jesus.  Luke  gives 
more  details  here  than  in  20:45-47  =  Matt.  23:1-7,  but 
there  is  no  reason  at  all  why  Jesus  should  not  have  had 
this  conflict  at  the  Pharisee's  breakfast  before  that  in  the 
temple  in  the  great  Tuesday  debate. 


CHAPTER  XII 

I.  In  the  meantime  {en  hois).  It  is  a  classic  idiom  to  start 
a  sentence  or  even  a  paragraph  as  here  with  a  relative,  "in 
which  things  or  circumstances,"  without  any  expressed 
antecedent  other  than  the  incidents  in  n:53f.  In  12:3 
Luke  actually  begins  the  sentence  with  two  relatives  anth' 
hon  hosa  (wherefore  whatsoever).  Many  thousands  {muria- 
don).  Genitive  absolute  with  episunachtheison  (first  aorist 
passive  participle  feminine  plural  because  of  muriadon), 
a  double  compound  late  verb,  episunago,  to  gather  together 
unto.  The  word  "myriads"  is  probably  hyperbolical  as  in 
Acts  21:20,  but  in  the  sense  of  ten  thousand,  as  in  Acts 
19:19,  it  means  a  very  large  crowd  apparently  drawn  to- 
gether by  the  violent  attacks  of  the  rabbis  against  Jesus. 
Insomuch  that  they  trode  one  upon  another  {hoste  katapatein 
allelous).  The  imagination  must  complete  the  picture  of 
this  jam.  Unto  his  disciples  first  of  all  {pros  tous  mathetas 
autou  proton).  This  long  discourse  in  Luke  12  is  really  a 
series  of  separate  talks  to  various  groups  in  the  vast  crowds 
around  Jesus.  This  particular  talk  goes  through  verse  12. 
Beware  of  {prosechete  heautois  apo).  Put  your  mind  {noun 
understood)  for  yourselves  (dative)  and  avoid  {apo  with  the 
ablative).  The  leaven  of  the  Pharisees  which  is  hypocrisy 
{tes  zumes  hetis  estin  hupocrisis  ton  Pharisaion).  In  Mark 
8:15  Jesus  had  coupled  the  lesson  of  the  Pharisees  with  that 
of  Herod,  in  Matt.  16:6  with  that  of  the  Sadducees  also.  He 
had  long  ago  called  the  Pharisees  hypocrites  (Matt.  6:2,  5, 
16).  The  occasion  was  ripe  here  for  this  crisp  saying.  In 
Matt.  13 :33  leaven  does  not  have  an  evil  sense  as  here,  which 
see.  See  Matt.  23:13  for  hypocrites.  Hypocrisy  was  the 
leading  Pharisaic  vice  (Bruce)  and  was  a  mark  of  sanctity 
to  hide  an  evil  heart.

2.  Covered  up  (sugkekalummenon  estin).  Periphrastic 
perfect  passive  indicative  of  sugkalupto,  an  old  verb,  but 
here  only  in  the  N.T.,  to  cover  up  on  all  sides  and  so  com- 
pletely. Verses  2  to  9  here  are  parallel  with  Matt.  10:26- 
33  spoken  to  the  Twelve  on  their  tour  of  Galilee,  illustrating 
again  how  often  Jesus  repeated  his  sayings  unless  we  prefer 
to  say  that  he  never  did  so  and  that  the  Gospels  have  hope- 
lessly jumbled  them  as  to  time  and  place.  See  the  passage 
in  Matthew  for  discussion  of  details. 

3.  In  the  inner  chambers  {en  tois  tameiois).  Old  form  ta- 
mieion,  a  store  chamber  (Luke  12:24),  secret  room  (Matt. 
6:6;  Luke  12:3). 

4.  Unto  you  my  friends  {humin  tois  philois).  As  opposed 
to  the  Pharisees  and  lawyers  in  11:43,  46,  53.  Be  not  afraid 
of  {me  phobethete  apo).  First  aorist  passive  subjunctive  with 
me,  ingressive  aorist,  do  not  become  afraid  of,  with  apo  and 
the  ablative  like  the  Hebrew  min  and  the  English  "be 
afraid  of,"  a  translation  Hebraism  as  in  Matt.  10:28  (Moul- 
ton,  Prolegomena,  p.  102).  Have  no  more  that  they  can  do 
{me  echonton  perissoteron  ti  poiesai).  Luke  often  uses  the 
infinitive  thus  with  echo,  a  classic  idiom  (7:40,  42;  12:4,  50; 
14:14;  Acts  4:14,  etc.). 

5.  Whom  ye  shall  fear  {tina  phobethete).  First  aorist  pas- 
sive subjunctive  deliberative  retained  in  the  indirect  ques- 
tion. Tina  is  the  accusative,  the  direct  object  of  this  tran- 
sitive passive  verb  (note  apo  in  verse  4).  Fear  him  who 
{phobethete  ton).  First  aorist  passive  imperative,  differing 
from  the  preceding  form  only  in  the  accent  and  governing  the 
accusative  also.  After  he  hath  killed  {meta  to  apokteinai). 
Preposition  meta  with  the  articular  infinitive.  Literally, 
"After  the  killing"  (first  aorist  active  infinitive  of  the  com- 
mon verb  apokteino,  to  kill.  Into  hell  {eis  ten  geennan).  See 
on  Matt.  5 :22.  Gehenna  is  a  transliteration  of  Ge-Hinnom, 
Valley  of  Hinnon  where  the  children  were  thrown  on  to  the 
red-hot  arms  of  Molech.    Josiah  (II  Kings  23:10)  abolished 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  173 

these  abominations  and  then  it  was  a  place  for  all  kinds  of 
refuse  which  burned  ceaselessly  and  became  a  symbol  of 
punishment  in  the  other  world.  This  one  fear  {touton  pho- 
bethete).    As  above. 

6.  Is  forgotten  {estin  epilele  smenon) .  Periphrastic  per- 
fect passive  indicative  of  epilanthanomai,  common  verb  to 
forget.    See  Matt.  10:29  f°r  a  different  construction. 

7.  Numbered  {erithmentai) .  Perfect  passive  indicative. 
Periphrastic  form  in  Matt.  10:30  which  see  for  details  about 
sparrows,  etc. 

8.  Everyone  who  shall  confess  me  {pas  hos  an  homologesei 
en  emoi).  Just  like  Matt.  10:32  except  the  use  of  an  here 
which  adds  nothing.  The  Hebraistic  use  of  en  after  homo- 
logeo  both  here  and  in  Matthew  is  admitted  by  even  Moul- 
ton  {Prolegomena,  p.  104).  The  Son  of  man  {ho  huios  tou 
anthrbpou).  Here  Matt.  10:32  has  k'ago  (I  also)  as  the 
equivalent. 

9.  Shall  be  denied  {aparnethesetai).  First  future  passive 
of  the  compound  verb  aparneomai.  Here  Matt.  10:33  has 
arnesomai  simply.  Instead  of  "in  the  presence  of  the  angels 
of  God"  {emprosthen  ton  aggelbn  tou  theou)  Matt.  10:33  has 
"before  my  Father  who  is  in  heaven." 

10.  But  unto  him  that  blasphemeth  against  the  Holy  Spirit 
{toi  de  eis  to  hagion  pneuma  blaspheme santi).  This  un- 
pardonable sin  is  given  by  Mark  3:28f.  =  Matt.  12:3 if. 
immediately  after  the  charge  that  Jesus  was  in  league  with 
Beelzebub.  Luke  here  separates  it  from  the  same  charge 
made  in  Judea  (11:15-20).  As  frequently  said,  there  is  no 
sound  reason  for  saying  that  Jesus  only  spoke  his  memor- 
able sayings  once.  Luke  apparently  finds  a  different  en- 
vironment here.  Note  the  use  of  eis  here  in  the  sense  of 
"against." 

11.  Be  not  anxious  {me  merimnesete).  First  aorist  active 
subjunctive  with  me  in  prohibition.  Do  not  become  anxious. 
See  a  similar  command  to  the  Twelve  on  their  Galilean  tour

(Matt.  io:i9f.)  and  in  the  great  discourse  on  the  Mount  of 
Olives  at  the  end  (Mark  13:11  =  Luke  21  :i4f.),  given  twice 
by  Luke  as  we  see.  How  or  what  ye  shall  answer  (pos  e  ti 
apologesesthe).  Indirect  question  and  retaining  the  delibera- 
tive subjunctive  apologesesthe  and  also  eipete  (say). 

12.  What  ye  ought  to  say  (ha  dei  eipein).  Literally,  what 
things  it  is  necessary  (dei)  to  say.  This  is  no  excuse  for  neg- 
lect in  pulpit  preparation.  It  is  simply  a  word  for  courage 
m  a  crisis  to  play  the  man  for  Christ  and  to  trust  the  issue 
with  God  without  fear. 

13.  Bid  my  brother  (eipe  toi  adelphbi  mou).  This  volunteer 
from  the  crowd  draws  attention  to  the  multitude  (verses 
13-21).  He  does  not  ask  for  arbitration  and  there  is  no 
evidence  that  his  brother  was  willing  for  that.  He  wants  a 
decision  by  Jesus  against  his  brother.  The  law  (Deut.  21  :ij) 
was  two-thirds  to  the  elder,  one-third  to  the  younger. 

14.  A  judge  or  a  divider  (kriten  e  meristen).  Jesus  repudi- 
ates the  position  of  judge  or  arbiter  in  this  family  fuss.  The 
language  reminds  one  of  Ex.  2:14.  Jesus  is  rendering  unto 
Caesar  the  things  of  Caesar  (Luke  20:25)  an<^  shows  that 
his  kingdom  is  not  of  this  world  (John  18:36).  The  word 
for  divider  or  arbiter  (meristes)  is  a  late  word  from  merizomai 
(verse  13)  and  occurs  here  only  in  the  N.T. 

15.  From  all  covetousness  (apo  pases  pleonexias).  Ablative 
case.  From  every  kind  of  greedy  desire  for  more  (pleon, 
more,  hexia,  from  echo,  to  have)  an  old  word  which  we  have 
robbed  of  its  sinful  aspects  and  refined  to  mean  business 
thrift.  In  the  abundance  of  the  things  which  he  possesseth 
(en  toi  peris seuein  tini  ek  ton  huparchonton  autoi).  A  rather 
awkward  Lukan  idiom:  "In  the  abounding  (articular  in- 
finitive) to  one  out  of  the  things  belonging  (articular  parti- 
ciple) to  him." 

16.  A  parable  unto  them  (parabolen  pros  autous).  The 
multitude  of  verses  13  and  15.  A  short  and  pungent  parable 
suggested   by  the   covetousness  of  the   man  of  verse   13. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  175 

Brought  forth  plentifully  {euphoresen).  Late  word  from 
euphoros  (bearing  well),  in  medical  writers  and  Josephus, 
here  only  in  the  N.T. 

17.  Reasoned  within  himself  (dielogizeto  en  hautoi).  Im- 
perfect middle,  picturing  his  continued  cogitations  over  his 
perplexity.  Where  to  bestow  {pou  sunaxb).  Future  indicative 
deliberative,  where  I  shall  gather  together.  My  fruits  {tous 
karpous  mou).  So  it  is  with  the  rich  fool:  my  fruits,  my 
barns,  my  corn,  my  goods,  just  like  Nabal  whose  very  name 
means  fool  (I  Sam.  25:11),  whether  a  direct  reference  to  him 
or  not. 

18.  /  will  pull  down  (kathelo).  Future  active  of  kathaireo, 
an  old  verb,  the  usual  future  being  kathaireso.  This  second 
form  from  the  second  aorist  katheilon  (from  obsolete  held) 
like  aphelei  in  Rev.  22:19.  My  barns  {mou  tas  apothekas). 
From  apotithemi,  to  lay  by,  to  treasure.  So  a  granary  or 
storehouse,  an  old  word,  six  times  in  the  N.T.  (Matt.  3:12; 
6:26;  13:30;  Luke  3:17;  12:18,  24).  All  my  corn  (panta  ton 
siton).  Better  grain  (wheat,  barley),  not  maize  or  Indian 
corn.  My  goods  [ta  agatha  mou).  Like  the  English,  my  good 
things.    So  the  English  speak  of  goods  (freight)  train. 

19.  Laid  up  for  many  years  {keimena  eis  ete  polla).  Not  in 
D  and  some  other  Latin  MSS.  The  man's  apostrophe  to  his 
"soul"  (psuche)  is  thoroughly  Epicurean,  for  his  soul  feeds 
on  his  goods.  The  asyndeton  here  (take  thine  ease,  eat, 
drink,  be  merry)  shows  his  eagerness.  Note  difference  in 
tenses  {anapauou,  keep  on  resting,  phage,  eat  at  once,  pie, 
drink  thy  fill,  euphrainou,  keep  on  being  merry),  first  and 
last  presents,  the  other  two  aorists. 

20.  Thou  foolish  one  {aphrbn).  Fool,  for  lack  of  sense  (a 
privative  and  phren,  sense)  as  in  11:40  and  II  Cor.  11:19. 
Old  word,  used  by  Socrates  in  Xenophon.  Nominative  form 
as  vocative.  Is  thy  soul  required  of  thee  {ten  psuchen  sou 
aitousin  apo  sou).  Plural  active  present,  not  passive:  "They 
are  demanding  thy  soul  from  thee."    The  impersonal  plural 


176      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

(aitousin)  is  common  enough  (Luke  6:38;  I2:li;  16:9;  23:31). 

The  rabbis  used  "they"  to  avoid  saying  "God." 

21.  Not  rich  toward  God  (me  eis  theon  plouton).  The  only 
wealth  that  matters  and  that  lasts.  Cf.  16:9  and  Matt. 
6:191.  Some  MSS.  do  not  have  this  verse.  Westcott  and 
Hort  bracket  it. 

22.  Unto  his  disciples  (pros  tous  mathetas  autou).  So 
Jesus  turns  from  the  crowd  to  the  disciples  (verses  22  to  40, 
when  Peter  interrupts  the  discourse).  From  here  to  the  end 
of  the  chapter  Luke  gives  material  that  appears  in  Matthew, 
but  not  in  one  connection  as  here.  In  Matthew  part  of  it 
is  in  the  charge  to  the  Twelve  on  their  tour  in  Galilee,  part 
in  the  eschatological  discourse  on  the  Mount  of  Olives. 
None  of  it  is  in  Mark.  Hence  Q  or  the  Logia  seems  to  be  the 
source  of  it.  The  question  recurs  again  whether  Jesus  re- 
peated on  other  occasions  what  is  given  here  or  whether 
Luke  has  here  put  together  separate  discourses  as  Matthew 
is  held  by  many  to  have  done  in  the  Sermon  on  the  Mount. 
We  have  no  way  of  deciding  these  points.  We  can  only  say 
again  that  Jesus  would  naturally  repeat  his  favourite  sayings 
like  other  popular  preachers  and  teachers.  So  Luke  12 122-3 1 
corresponds  to  Matt.  6:25-33,  which  see  for  detailed  dis- 
cussion. The  parable  of  the  rich  fool  was  spoken  to  the 
crowd,  but  this  exhortation  to  freedom  from  care  (22-31) 
is  to  the  disciples.  So  the  language  in  Luke  12:22  is  precisely 
that  in  Matt.  6:25.  See  there  for  me  merimndte  (stop  being 
anxious)  and  the  deliberative  subjunctive  retained  in  the 
indirect  question  (phagete,  endusesthe).  So  verse  23  here  is 
the  same  in  Matt.  6:25  except  that  there  it  is  a  question  with 
ouch  expecting  the  affirmative  answer,  whereas  here  it  is 
given  as  a  reason  (gar,  for)  for  the  preceding  command. 

24.  The  ravens  (tous  korakas).  Nowhere  else  in  the  N.T. 
The  name  includes  the  whole  crow  group  of  birds  (rooks  and 
jackdaws).  Like  the  vultures  they  are  scavengers.  Matt. 
6:26   has   simply   "the   birds"    (ta  peteina).      Storechamber 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  177 

(tameion).  Not  in  Matt.  6:26.  Means  secret  chamber  in 
Luke  12:3.  Of  how  much  more  (posoi  motion).  Matt.  6:26 
has  question,  ouch  mallon. 

25.  A  cubit  (pechun).  Matt.  6:27  has  pechun  hena  (one 
cubit,  though  hena  is  sometimes  merely  the  indefinite  article. 
Stature  (helikian)  as  in  Matthew,  which  see. 

26.  Not  able  to  do  even  that  which  is  least  (oude  elachiston 
dunasthe).  Negative  oude  in  the  condition  of  the  first  class. 
Elative  superlative,  very  small.  This  verse  not  in  Matthew 
and  omitted  in  D.  Verse  27  as  in  Matt.  6:28,  save  that  the 
verbs  for  toil  and  spin  are  plural  in  Matthew  and  singular 
here  (neuter  plural  subject,  ta  krina). 

28.  Clothe  (amphiazei).  Late  Greek  verb  in  the  Koine 
(papyri)  for  the  older  form  amphiennumi  (Matt.  6:30).  See 
Matthew  for  discussion  of  details.  Matthew  has  "the  grass 
of  the  field"  instead  of  "the  grass  in  the  field"  as  here. 

29.  Seek  not  ye  (humeis  me  zeteite).  Note  emphatic  posi- 
tion of  "ye"  (humeis).  Stop  seeking  (me  and  present  im- 
perative active).  Matt.  6:31  has:  "Do  not  become  anxious" 
(me  merimnesete),  me  and  ingressive  subjunctive  occur  as 
direct  questions  (What  are  we  to  eat?  What  are  we  to  drink? 
What  are  we  to  put  on?)  whereas  here  they  are  in  the  indi- 
rect form  as  in  verse  22  save  that  the  problem  of  clothing  is 
not  here  mentioned :  Neither  be  ye  of  doubtful  mind  (kai  me 
meteor  izesthe).  Me  and  present  passive  imperative  (stop 
being  anxious)  of  meteorizb.  An  old  verb  from  metebros  in 
midair,  high  (our  meteor),  to  lift  up  on  high,  then  to  lift 
oneself  up  with  hopes  (false  sometimes),  to  be  buoyed  up, 
to  be  tossed  like  a  ship  at  sea,  to  be  anxious,  to  be  in  doubt 
as  in  late  writers  (Polybius,  Josephus).  This  last  meaning 
is  probably  true  here.  In  the  LXX  and  Philo,  but  here  only 
in  the  N.T. 

31.  See  Matt.  6:33  for  this  verse.  Luke  does  not  have 
"first"  nor  "his  righteousness"  nor  "all." 

32.  Little  flock  (to  mikron  poimnion).    Vocative  with  the 


178      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

article  as  used  in  Hebrew  and  often  in  the  Koine  and  so  in 
the  N.T.  See  both  pater  and  ho  pater  in  the  vocative  in  Luke 
10:21.  See  Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  4651".  Poimnion 
(flock)  is  a  contraction  from  poimenion  from  poimen  (shep- 
herd) instead  of  the  usual  poimne  (flock).  So  it  is  not  a 
diminutive  and  mikron  is  not  superfluous,  though  it  is  pa- 
thetic. For  it  is  your  Father's  good  pleasure  (hoti  eudokesen 
ho  pater  humbn).  First  aorist  active  indicative  of  eudokeb. 
Timeless  aorist  as  in  Luke  3 :22.  This  verse  has  no  parallel 
in  Matthew. 

33.  Sell  that  ye  have  {Poles ate  ta  huparchonta  humbn).  Not 
in  Matthew.     Did  Jesus  mean  this  literally  and  always? 

\  Luke  has  been  charged  with  Ebionism,  but  Jesus  does  not 
condemn  property  as  inherently  sinful.  ''The  attempt  to 
keep  the  letter  of  the  rule  here  given  (Acts  2:44,  45)  had 
disastrous  effects  on  the  church  of  Jerusalem,  which  speedily 
became  a  church  of  paupers,  constantly  in  need  of  alms 
(Rom.  15:25,  26;  I  Cor.  16:3;  II  Cor.  8:4;  9:1)"  (Plummer). 
Purses  which  wax  not  old  (ballantia  me  palaioumena) .  So 
already  ballantion  in  Luke  10:4.  Late  verb  palaiob  from 
palaios,  old,  to  make  old,  declare  old  as  in  Heb.  8:13,  is  pas- 
sive to  become  old  as  here  and  Heb.  1:11.  That  faileth  not 
(anekleipton).  Verbal  from  a  privative  and  ekleipb,  to  fail. 
Late  word  in  Diodorus  and  Plutarch.  Only  here  in  the  N.T. 
or  LXX,  but  in  papyri.  "I  prefer  to  believe  that  even  Luke 
sees  in  the  words  not  a  mechanical  rule,  but  a  law  for  the 
spirit"  (Bruce).  Draweth  near  (eggizei).  Instead  of  Matt. 
6:19  "dig  through  and  steal."  Destroyelh  (diaphtheirei) .  In- 
stead of  "doth  consume"  in  Matt.  6:19. 

34.  Will  be  (estai).  Last  word  in  the  sentence  in  Luke. 
Otherwise  like  Matt.  6.21.  See  I  Cor.  7:32-34  for  similar 
principle. 

35.  Be  girded  about  (estbsan  periezbsmenai).  Periphrastic 
perfect  passive  imperative  third  plural  of  the  verb  perizbn- 
numi  or  perizbnnub  (later  form),  an  old  verb,  to  gird  around, 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  179 

to  fasten  the  garments  with  a  girdle.  The  long  garments  of 
the  orientals  made  speed  difficult.  It  was  important  to  use 
the  girdle  before  starting.  Cf.  17:8;  Acts  12:8.  Burning 
(kaiomenoi).  Periphrastic  present  middle  imperative,  al- 
ready burning  and  continuously  burning.  The  same  point 
of  the  Parable  of  the  Ten  Virgins  (Matt.  25:1-13)  is  found 
here  in  condensed  form.  This  verse  introduces  the  parable 
of  the  waiting  servants  (Luke  12:35-40). 

36.  When  he  shall  return  from  the  marriage  feast  (pote 
analusei  ek  ton  gamon).  The  interrogative  conjunction  pote 
and  the  deliberative  aorist  subjunctive  retained  in  the  in- 
direct question.  The  verb  analuo,  very  common  Greek  verb, 
but  only  twice  in  the  N.T.  (here  and  Phil.  1 123).  The  figure 
is  breaking  up  a  camp  or  loosening  the  mooring  of  a  ship, 
to  depart.  Perhaps  here  the  figure  is  from  the  standpoint  of 
the  wedding  feast  (plural  as  used  of  a  single  wedding  feast  in 
Luke  14:8),  departing  from  there.  See  on  Matt.  22:2.  When 
he  cometh  and  knocketh  (elthontos  kai  krousantos).  Genitive 
absolute  of  the  aorist  active  participle  without  autou  and  in 
spite  of  autbi  (dative)  being  used  after  anoixbsin  (first  aorist 
active  subjunctive  of  anoigb). 

37.  He  shall  gird  himself  (perizosetai) .  Direct  future  mid- 
dle. Jesus  did  this  (John  13  4),  not  out  of  gratitude,  but  to 
give  the  apostles  an  object  lesson  in  humility.  See  the  usual 
course  in  Luke  17:7-10  with  also  the  direct  middle  (verse  8) 
of  perisbnnub. 

38.  And  if  (k,an  =  kai-\- ean).  Repeated.  Elthei  and 
heurei,  both  second  aorist  subjunctive  with  ean,  condition 
of  the  third  class,  undetermined,  but  with  prospect  of 
being  determined.  Blessed  (makarioi).  Beatitude  here  as  in 
verse  37. 

39.  The  thief  (ho  kleptes).  The  change  here  almost  makes 
a  new  parable  to  illustrate  the  other,  the  parable  of  the 
housebreaking  (verses  39  and  40)  to  illustrate  the  parable 
of  the  waiting  servants  (35-38).    This  same  language  appears 


180      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

in  Matt.  24 143 f.  "The  Master  returning  from  a  wedding  is 
replaced  by  a  thief  whose  study  it  is  to  come  to  the  house 
he  means  to  plunder  at  an  unexpected  time"  (Bruce).  The 
parallel  in  Matt.  24:43-51  with  Luke  12:39-46  does  not  have 
the  interruption  by  Peter.  He  would  have  watched  (egregore- 
sen  an).  Apodosis  of  second-class  condition,  determined  as 
unfulfilled,  made  plain  by  use  of  an  with  aorist  indicative 
which  is  not  repeated  with  ouk  apheken  (first  aorist  active 
indicative  of  aphiemi,  k  aorist),  though  it  is  sometimes  re- 
peated (Matt.  24:43). 

40.  Be  ye  {ginesthe).  Present  middle  imperative,  keep  on 
becoming.  Cometh  (erchetai).  Futuristic  present  indicative. 
See  Matt.  24:43  to  51  for  details  in  the  comparison  with 
Luke. 

41.  Peter  said  (Eipen  de  ho  Petros).  This  whole  paragraph 
from  verse  22  to  verse  40  had  been  addressed  directly  to  the 
disciples.  Hence  it  is  not  surprising  to  find  Peter  putting  in 
a  question.  This  incident  confirms  also  the  impression  that 
Luke  is  giving  actual  historical  data  in  the  environment  of 
these  discourses.  He  is  certain  that  the  Twelve  are  meant, 
but  he  desires  to  know  if  others  are  included,  for  he  had 
spoken  to  the  multitude  in  verses  13  to  21.  Recall  Mark 
13:37.  This  interruption  is  somewhat  like  that  on  the 
Mount  of  Transfiguration  (Luke  9:33)  and  is  characteristic 
of  Peter.  Was  it  the  magnificent  promise  in  verse  37  that 
stirred  Peter's  impulsiveness?  It  is  certainly  more  than  a 
literary  device  of  Luke.  Peter's  question  draws  out  a 
parabolic  reply  by  Jesus  (42-48). 

42.  Who  then  (tis  ara).  Jesus  introduces  this  parable  of 
the  wise  steward  (42-48)  by  a  rhetorical  question  that 
answers  itself.  Peter  is  this  wise  steward,  each  of  the  Twelve 
is,  anyone  is  who  acts  thus.  The  faithful  and  wise  steward 
(ho  pistos  oikonomos  ho  phronimos).  The  faithful  steward, 
the  wise  one.  A  steward  is  house  manager  (oikos,  nemo,  to 
manage).    Each  man  is  a  steward  in  his  own  responsibilities. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  l8j 

Household  (therapeias).  Literally,  service  from  therapeuo, 
medical  service  as  in  Luke  9:11,  by  metonymy  household 
(a  body  of  those  domestics  who  serve).  Their  portion  of  food 
{to  sitometrion) .  Late  word  from  sitometreo  (Gen.  47:12)  for 
the  Attic  ton  siton  metreo,  to  measure  the  food,  the  rations. 
Here  only  in  the  N.T.  or  anywhere  else  till  Deissmann 
(Bible  Studies,  p.  158)  found  it  in  an  Egyptian  papyrus  and 
then  an  inscription  in  Lycia  (Light  from  the  Ancient  East, 
p.  104). 

44.  Over  all  (epi  pasin).  See  Matt.  24-47  for  epi  with 
locative  in  this  sense.  Usually  with  genitive  as  in  verse  42 
and  sometimes  with  accusative  as  in  verse  14. 

45.  Shall  say  (eipei).  Second  aorist  subjunctive,  with 
ean,  condition  of  the  third  class,  undetermined,  but  with 
prospect  of  being  determined.  Delay eth  (chronizei).  From 
chronos,  time,  spends  time,  lingers.  Shall  begin  (arxetai). 
First  aorist  middle  subjunctive  with  ean  and  the  same 
condition  as  eipei,  above.  The  menservants  (tous  paidas) 
and  the  maidservants  (kai  tas  paidiskas).  Paidiske  is  a 
diminutive  of  pais  for  a  young  female  slave  and  occurs  in 
the  papyri,  orginally  just  a  damsel.  Here  pais  can  mean 
slave  also  though  strictly  just  a  boy. 

46.  Shall  cut  him  asunder  (dichotomesei).  An  old  and 
somewhat  rare  word  from  dichotomos  and  that  from  dicha 
and  temnb,  to  cut,  to  cut  in  two.  Used  literally  here.  In 
the  N.T.  only  here  and  Matt.  24:51.  With  the  unfaithful 
(meta  ion  apistbn).  Not  here  "the  unbelieving"  though  that 
is  a  common  meaning  of  apistos  (a  privative  and  pistos,  from 
peitho),  but  the  unreliable,  the  untrustworthy.  Here  Matt. 
24:51  has  "with  the  hypocrites,"  the  same  point.  The  paral- 
lel with  Matt.  24:43-51  ends  here.  Matt.  24:51  adds  the 
saying  about  the  wailing  and  the  gnashing  of  teeth.  Clearly 
there  Luke  places  the  parable  of  the  wise  steward  in  this 
context  while  Matthew  has  it  in  the  great  eschatological 
discourse.     Once  again  we  must  either  think  that  Jesus 


1 82      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

repeated  the  parable  or  that  one  of  the  writers  has  misplaced 
it.    Luke  alone  preserves  what  he  gives  in  verses  47  and  48. 

47.  Which  knew  (ho  gnous).  Articular  participle  (second 
aorist  active,  punctiliar  and  timeless).  The  one  who  knows. 
So  as  to  me  hetoimasas  e  poiesas  (does  not  make  ready  or  do). 
Shall  be  beaten  with  many  stripes  (daresetai  pollas).  Second 
future  passive  of  dero,  to  skin,  to  beat,  to  flay  (see  on  Matt. 
21:35;  Mark  12:3,  5).  The  passive  voice  retains  here  the 
accusative  pollas  (supply  plegas,  present  in  Luke  10:30). 
The  same  explanation  applies  to  oligas  in  verse  48. 

48.  To  whomsoever  much  is  given  (panti  de  hoi  edothe  polu). 
Here  is  inverse  attraction  from  hoi  to  panti  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  pp.  767L).  Note  par'  autou  (from  him)  without 
any  regard  to  panti.  They  commit  (parethento) .  Second  ao- 
rist middle  indicative,  timeless  or  gnomic  aorist.  Note  the 
impersonal  plural  after  the  passive  voice  just  before. 

49.  /  came  to  cast  fire  (Pur  elthon  balein).  Suddenly  Jesus 
lets  the  volcano  in  his  own  heart  burst  forth.  The  fire  was 
already  burning.  "Christ  came  to  set  the  world  on  fire, 
and  the  conflagration  had  already  begun"  (Plummer).  The 
very  passion  in  Christ's  heart  would  set  his  friends  on  fire 
and  his  foes  in  opposition  as  we  have  just  seen  (Luke  11 : 
53L).  It  is  like  the  saying  of  Jesus  that  he  came  to  bring  not 
peace,  but  a  sword,  to  bring  cleavage  among  men  (Matt. 
10:34-36).  And  what  will  I,  if  it  is  already  kindled?  (kai  ti 
thelb  ei  ede  anephthe;).  It  is  not  clear  what  this  passage 
means.  Probably  ti  is  be  taken  in  the  sense  of  "how" 
(pos).  How  I  wish.  Then  ei  can  be  taken  as  equal  to  hoti. 
How  I  wish  that  it  were  already  kindled.  Anephthe  is  first 
aorist  passive  of  anapto,  to  set  fire  to,  to  kindle,  to  make 
blaze.  Probably  Luke  means  the  conflagration  to  come  by 
his  death  on  the  Cross  for  he  changes  the  figure  and  refers  to 
that  more  plainly. 

50.  /  have  a  baptism  (baptisma  de  echo).  Once  again 
Jesus  will  call  his  baptism  the  baptism  of  blood  and  will 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  183 

challenge  James  and  John  to  it  (Mark  io:32f.  =  Matt. 
20:22f.).  So  here.  "Having  used  the  metaphor  of  fire, 
Christ  now  uses  the  metaphor  of  water.  The  one  sets  forth 
the  result  of  his  coming  as  it  affects  the  world,  the  other  as 
it  affects  himself.  The  world  is  lit  up  with  flames  and  Christ 
is  bathed  in  blood"  (Plummer).  And  how  I  am  straitened 
{kai  pos  sunechomai).  See  this  same  vivid  verb  sunechomai 
in  Luke  8:37  and  in  Acts  18:5  and  in  Phil.  1:23  where  Paul 
uses  it  of  his  desire  for  death  just  as  Jesus  does  here.  The 
urge  of  the  Cross  is  upon  Jesus  at  the  moment  of  these  words. 
We  catch  a  glimpse  of  the  tremendous  passion  in  his  soul  that 
drove  him  on.  Till  it  be  accomplished  iheos  hotou  telesthei). 
First  aorist  passive  subjunctive  of  teleo  with  heos  hotou 
(until  which  time),  the  common  construction  for  the  future 
with  this  conjunction. 

51.  But  rather  division  {alV  e  diamerismon) .  Peace  at  any 
price  is  not  the  purpose  of  Christ.  It  is  a  pity  for  family  jars 
to  come,  but  loyalty  to  Christ  counts  more  than  all  else. 
These  ringing  words  (Luke  12:51-53)  occur  in  Matt.  10:34-36 
in  the  address  to  the  Twelve  for  the  Galilean  tour.  See  dis- 
cussion of  details  there.  These  family  feuds  are  inevitable 
where  only  part  cleave  to  Christ.  In  Matthew  we  have  kata 
with  the  genitive  whereas  in  Luke  it  is  epi  with  the  dative 
(and  accusative  once). 

54.  To  the  multitudes  also  {kai  tois  ochlois).  After  the 
strong  and  stirring  words  just  before  with  flash  and  force 
Jesus  turns  finally  in  this  series  of  discourses  to  the  multi- 
tudes again  as  in  verse  15.  There  are  similar  sayings  to  these 
verses  54-59  in  Matt.  i6:if.  and  5:25^  There  is  a  good  deal 
of  difference  in  phraseology  whether  that  is  due  to  difference 
of  source  or  different  use  of  the  same  source  (Q  or  Logia)  we 
do  not  know.  Not  all  the  old  MSS.  give  Matt.  16:2  and  3. 
In  Matthew  the  Pharisees  and  Sadducees  were  asking  for  a 
sign  from  heaven  as  they  often  did.  These  signs  of  the 
weather,  "a  shower"  (ombros,  Luke   12:54)  due  to  clouds 


1 84      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

in  the  west,  "a  hot  wave"  {kausbn,  verse  55)  due  to  a 
south  wind  (noton)  blowing,  "fair  weather"  {eudia,  Matt. 
16:2)  when  the  sky  is  red,  are  appealed  to  today.  They  have 
a  more  or  less  general  application  due  to  atmospheric  and 
climatic  conditions. 

56.  To  interpret  this  time  {ton  kairon  touton  dokimazein). 
To  test  dokimazein  as  spiritual  chemists.  No  wonder  that 
Jesus  here  calls  them  "hypocrites"  because  of  their  blindness 
when  looking  at  and  hearing  him.  So  it  is  today  with  those 
who  are  willfully  blind  to  the  steps  of  God  among  men.  This 
ignorance  of  the  signs  of  the  times  is  colossal. 

57.  Even  of  yourselves  {kai  apW  heautbn).  Without  the 
presence  and  teaching  of  Jesus  they  had  light  enough  to  tell 
what  is  right  {to  dikaion)  and  so  without  excuse  as  Paul 
argued  in  Rom.  1  to  3. 

58.  Give  diligence  to  be  quit  of  him  {dos  ergasian  apellachthai 
ap'  autou).  Second  aorist  active  imperative  dos  from  didbmi. 
Apellachthai,  perfect  passive  infinitive  of  apallassb  an  old 
verb  common,  but  only  twice  in  the  N.T.  (here  and  Acts 
19:12).  Used  here  in  a  legal  sense  and  the  tense  emphasizes 
a  state  of  completion,  to  be  rid  of  him  for  good.  Hale  thee 
{katasurei).  Drag  down  forcibly,  old  verb,  only  here  in  the 
N.T.  To  the  officer  {tbi  praktori).  The  doer,  the  proctor, 
the  exactor  of  fines,  the  executor  of  punishment.  Old  word, 
only  here  in  the  N.T. 

59.  Till  thou  have  paid  {hebs  apodbis).  Second  aorist  ac- 
tive subjunctive  of  apodidbmi,  to  pay  back  in  full.  The  last 
mite  {to  eschaton  lepton).  From  lepb,  to  peel  off  the  bark. 
Very  small  brass  coin,  one-eighth  of  an  ounce.  In  the  N.T. 
only  here  and  Luke  21:2  =  Mark  12:42  (the  poor  widow's 
mite)  which  see. 


CHAPTER  XIII 

1.  At  that  very  season  {en  autbi  tbi  kairbi).  Luke's  fre- 
quent idiom,  "at  the  season  itself."  Apparently  in  close 
connexion  with  the  preceding  discourses.  Probably  "were 
present"  (paresan,  imperfect  of  pareimi)  means  "came," 
"stepped  to  his  side,"  as  often  (Matt.  26:50;  Acts  12:20; 
John  11:28).  These  people  had  a  piece  of  news  for  Jesus. 
Whose  blood  Pilate  had  mingled  with  their  sacrifices  (hon  to 
haima  Peilatos  emixen  meta  ton  thusibn  autbn).  The  verb 
emixen  is  first  aorist  active  (not  past  perfect)  of  mignumi, 
a  common  verb.  The  incident  is  recorded  nowhere  else, 
but  is  in  entire  harmony  with  Pilate's  record  for  outrages. 
These  Galileans  at  a  feast  in  Jerusalem  may  have  been  in- 
volved in  some  insurrection  against  the  Roman  government, 
the  leaders  of  whom  Pilate  had  slain  right  in  the  temple 
courts  where  the  sacrifices  were  going  on.  Jesus  comments 
on  the  incident,  but  not  as  the  reporters  had  expected.  In- 
stead of  denunciation  of  Pilate  he  turned  it  into  a  parable 
for  their  own  conduct  in  the  uncertainty  of  life. 

2.  Sinners  above  all  (hamartoloi  para  pantas).  Para  means 
"beside,"  placed  beside  all  the  Galileans,  and  so  beyond  or 
above  (with  the  accusative).  Have  suffered  (peponthasin). 
Second  perfect  active  indicative  third  plural  from  pascho, 
common  verb,  to  experience,  suffer.  The  tense  notes  that 
it  is  "an  irrevocable  fact"  (Bruce). 

3.  Except  ye  repent  {ean  me  metanoete).  Present  active 
subjunctive  of  metanoeo,  to  change  mind  and  conduct,  linear 
action,  keep  on  changing.  Condition  of  third  class,  unde- 
termined, but  with  prospect  of  determination.  Ye  shall 
perish  (apoleisthe) .  Future  middle  indicative  of  apollumi 
and  intransitive.    Common  verb. 

lis

4.  The  tower  in  Siloam  {ho  purgos  en  Siloam).  Few  sites 
have  been  more  clearly  located  than  this.  Jesus  mentions 
this  accident  (only  in  Luke)  of  his  own  accord  to  illustrate 
still  further  the  responsibility  of  his  hearers.  Jesus  makes 
use  of  public  events  in  both  these  incidents  to  teach  spiritual 
lessons.  He  gives  the  "moral"  to  the  massacre  of  the  Gali- 
lean pilgrims  and  the  "moral"  of  the  catastrophe  at  Siloam. 
Offenders  {opheiletai).  Literally,  debtors,  not  sinners  as  in 
verse  2  and  as  the  Authorized  Version  renders  here.  See 
7:41;  11:4;  Matt.  6:12;  18:24-34. 

5.  Except  ye  repent  (ean  me  metanoesete).  First  aorist 
active  subjunctive,  immediate  repentance  in  contrast  to 
continued  repentance,  metanoete  in  verse  3,  though  Westcott 
and  Hort  put  metanoete  in  the  margin  here.  The  interpreta- 
tion of  accidents  is  a  difficult  matter,  but  the  moral  pointed 
out  by  Jesus  is  obvious. 

6.  Planted  {pephuteumenen).  Perfect  passive  participle 
of  phuteuo,  to  plant,  an  old  verb,  from  phuton,  a  plant,  and 
that  from  phuo,  to  grow.  But  this  participle  with  eichen 
(imperfect  active  of  echo)  does  not  make  a  periphrastic  past 
perfect  like  our  English  "had  planted."  It  means  rather, 
he  had  a  fig  tree,  one  already  planted  in  his  vineyard. 

7.  The  vinedresser  {ton  ampelourgon).  Old  word,  but  here 
only  in  the  N.T.,  from  ampelos,  vine,  and  ergon,  work.  These 
three  years  I  come  {tria  ete  apW  hou  erchomai).  Literally, 
"three  years  since  (from  which  time)  I  come."  These  three 
years,  of  course,  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  three  years  of 
Christ's  public  ministry.  The  three  years  are  counted  from 
the  time  when  the  fig  tree  would  normally  be  expected  to 
bear,  not  from  the  time  of  planting.  The  Jewish  nation  is 
meant  by  this  parable  of  the  barren  fig  tree.  In  the  wither- 
ing of  the  barren  fig  tree  later  at  Jerusalem  we  see  parable 
changed  to  object  lesson  or  fact  (Mark  11  :I2-I4  =  Matt. 
2i:i8f.).  Cut  it  down  {ekkopson).  "Cut  it  out,"  the  Greek 
has  it,  out  of  the  vineyard,  perfective  use  of  ek  with  the 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  187 

effective  aorist  active  imperative  of  kopto,  where  we  prefer 
"down."  Why?  (hina  ti).  Ellipsis  here  of  genetai  of  which 
ti  is  subject  (Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  739,  916).  Also 
(kai).  Besides  bearing  no  fruit.  Doth  cumber  the  ground 
{ten  gen  katargei).  Makes  the  ground  completely  idle,  of 
no  use  (kata,  argeb,  from  argos,  a  privative  and  ergon, 
work).  Late  verb,  here  only  in  the  N.T.  except  in  Paul's 
Epistles. 

8.  Till  I  shall  dig  (heos  hotou  skapsc).  First  aorist  active 
subjunctive  like  bald  (second  aorist  active  subjunctive  of 
ballo),  both  common  verbs.  Dung  it  (bald  kopria).  Cast 
dung  around  it,  manure  it.  Kopria,  late  word,  here  alone 
in  the  N.T. 

9.  And  if  it  bear  fruit  thenceforth  (kan  men  poiesei  karpon 
eis  to  mellon).  Aposiopesis,  sudden  breaking  off  for  effect 
(Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1203).  See  it  also  in  Mark  11:32; 
Acts  23  :g.  Trench  (Parables)  tells  a  story  like  this  of  inter- 
cession for  the  fig  tree  for  one  year  more  which  is  widely 
current  among  the  Arabs  today  who  say  that  it  will  certainly 
bear  fruit  this  time. 

10.  He  was  teaching  (en  didaskbn).  Periphrastic  imper- 
fect active. 

11.  A  spirit  of  infirmity  (pneuma  astheneias).  A  spirit 
that  caused  the  weakness  (astheneias,  lack  of  strength)  like 
a  spirit  of  bondage  (Rom.  8:15),  genitive  case.  She  was 
bowed  together  (en  sunkuptousa).  Periphrastic  imperfect 
active  of  sunkuptb,  old  verb,  here  only  in  the  N.T.,  to  bend 
together,  medical  word  for  curvature  of  the  spine.  And 
could  in  no  wise  lift  herself  up  (kai  me  dunamene  anakupsai 
eis  to  panteles).  Negative  form  of  the  previous  statement. 
Anakupsai,  first  aorist  active  infinitive  of  anakuptb  (ana, 
kupto,  same  verb  above  compounded  with  sun).  Unable  to 
bend  herself  up  or  back  at  all  (eis  to  panteles,  wholly  as  in 
Heb.  7:25  only  other  passage  in  the  N.T.  where  it  occurs). 
The  poor  old  woman  had  to  come  in  all  bent  over-

12.  He  called  her  {pros ephbne sen) .  To  come  to  him  (pros). 
Thou  art  loosed  (apolelusai).  Perfect  passive  indicative  of 
apoluo,  common  verb,  loosed  to  stay  free.  Only  N.T.  ex- 
ample of  use  about  disease. 

13.  He  laid  his  hands  upon  her  (epetheken  autei  tas  cheiras). 
First  aorist  active  indicative  of  epitithemi.  As  the  Great 
Physician  with  gentle  kindness.  She  was  made  straight 
(anorthothe) .  First  aorist  (effective)  passive  indicative  of 
anorthoo,  old  verb,  but  only  three  times  in  the  N.T.  (Luke 
13:13;  Heb.  12:12;  Acts  15:16),  to  make  straight  again. 
Here  it  has  the  literal  sense  of  making  straight  the  old 
woman's  crooked  back.  She  glorified  God  (edoxazen  ton 
theon).  Imperfect  active.  Began  it  (inchoative)  and  kept 
it  up. 

14.  Answered  (apokritheis).  First  aorist  passive  participle 
of  apokrinomai.  No  one  had  spoken  to  him,  but  he  felt 
his  importance  as  the  ruler  of  the  synagogue  and  was  indig- 
nant (aganakton,  from  agan  and  achomai,  to  feel  much  pain). 
His  words  have  a  ludicrous  sound  as  if  all  the  people  had  to 
do  to  get  their  crooked  backs  straightened  out  was  to  come 
round  to  his  synagogue  during  the  week.  He  forgot  that 
this  poor  old  woman  had  been  coming  for  eighteen  years 
with  no  result.  He  was  angry  with  Jesus,  but  he  spoke  to 
the  multitude  (toi  ochloi).  Ought  (dei).  Really,  must,  nec- 
essary, a  direct  hit  at  Jesus  who  had  "worked"  on  the  sab- 
bath in  healing  this  old  woman.  And  not  (kai  me).  Instead 
of  kai  ou,  because  in  the  imperative  clause. 

15.  The  Lord  answered  him  (apekrithe  de  auibi  ho  Kurios). 
Note  use  of  "the  Lord"  of  Jesus  again  in  Luke's  narrative. 
Jesus  answered  the  ruler  of  the  synagogue  who  had  spoken 
to  the  crowd,  but  about  Jesus.  It  was  a  crushing  and  over- 
whelming reply.  Hypocrites  (hupokritai) .  This  pretentious 
faultfinder  and  all  who  agree  with  him.  Each  of  you  (hekas- 
tos  humon).  An  argumentum  ad  hominen.  These  very 
critics  of  Jesus  cared  too  much  for  an  ox  or  an  ass  to  leave 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  189 

it  all  the  sabbath  without  water.  Stall  (phatnes).  Old 
word,  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  2:7,  12,  16  the  manger 
where  the  infant  Jesus  was  placed.  To  watering  (potizei). 
Old  verb,  causative,  to  give  to  drink. 

16.  Daughter  of  Abraham  (thugatera  Abraam).  Triple 
argument,  human  being  and  not  an  ox  or  ass,  woman, 
daughter  of  Abraham  (Jewess),  besides  being  old  and  ill. 
Ought  not  (ouk  edei).  Imperfect  active.  Of  necessity.  Jesus 
simply  had  to  heal  her  even  if  on  the  sabbath.  Whom  Satan 
bound  (hen  edesen  ho  Satanas).  Definite  statement  that  her 
disease  was  due  to  Satan. 

17.  Were  put  to  shame  (kateischunonto) .  Imperfect  pas- 
sive of  kataischuno,  old  verb,  to  make  ashamed,  make  one 
feel  ashamed.  Passive  here,  to  blush  with  shame  at  their 
predicament.  Rejoiced  (echairen).  Imperfect  active.  Sharp 
contrast  in  the  emotions  of  the  two  groups.  Were  done 
(ginomenois) .  Present  middle  participle,  were  continually 
being  done. 

18.  He  said  therefore  (elegen  oun).  It  is  not  clear  to  what 
to  refer  "therefore,"  whether  to  the  case  of  the  woman  in 
verse  11,  the  enthusiasm  of  the  crowd  in  verse  17,  or  to 
something  not  recorded  by  Luke. 

19.  A  grain  of  mustard  seed  (kokkoi  sinapeos).  Either 
the  sinapis  nigra  or  the  salvadora  persica,  both  of  which 
have  small  seeds  and  grow  to  twelve  feet  at  times.  The 
Jews  had  a  proverb:  "Small  as  a  mustard  seed."  Given 
by  Mark  4:30-32  and  Matt.  13  :3if.  in  the  first  great  group 
of  parables,  but  just  the  sort  to  be  repeated.  Cast  into  his 
own  garden  (ebalen  eis  kepon  heautou).  Different  from 
"earth"  (Mark)  or  "field"  (Matthew.)"  Kepos,  old  word 
for  garden,  only  here  in  the  N.T.  and  John  19:1,  26;  19:41. 
Became  a  tree  (egeneto  eis  dendron).  Common  Hebraism, 
very  frequent  in  LXX,  only  in  Luke  in  the  N.T.,  but  does 
appear  in  Koine  though  rare  in  papyri;  this  use  of  eis  after 
words  like  ginomai.    It  is  a  translation  Hebraism  in  Luke. 


190      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Lodged    (kateskenbsen).      Mark    and   Matthew    have    kata- 
skenoin  infinitive  of  the  same  verb,  to  make  tent  (or  nest). 

20.  Whereunto  shall  I  liken?  (Tini  homoioso;).  This 
question  alone  in  Luke  here  as  in  verse  18.  But  the  parable 
is  precisely  like  that  in  Matt.  13:33,  which  see  for  details. 

22.  Journeying  on  unto  Jerusalem  (poreian  poioumenos  eis 
Ierosoluma).  Making  his  way  to  Jerusalem.  Note  tenses 
here  of  continued  action,  and  distributive  use  of  kata  with 
cities  and  villages.  This  is  the  second  of  the  journeys  to 
Jerusalem  in  this  later  ministry  corresponding  to  that  in 
John  11. 

23.  Are  they  jew  that  be  saved?  (ei  oligoi  hoi  sozomenoi;). 
Note  use  of  ei  as  an  interrogative  which  can  be  explained  as 
ellipsis  or  as  ei  =  e  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1024).  This  was 
an  academic  theological  problem  with  the  rabbis,  the  num- 
ber of  the  elect. 

24.  Strive  (agonize sthe).  Jesus  makes  short  shrift  of  the 
question.  He  includes  others  (present  middle  plural  of 
agbnizomai,  common  verb,  our  agonize).  Originally  it  was 
to  contend  for  a  prize  in  the  games.  The  kindred  word 
agbnia  occurs  of  Christ's  struggle  in  Gethsemane  (Luke  22: 
44).  The  narrow  gate  appears  also  in  Matt.  7:13,  only  there 
it  is  an  outside  gate  [pules)  while  here  it  is  the  entrance  to 
the  house,  "the  narrow  door"  (thuras). 

25.  When  once  (aph*  hou  an).  Possibly  to  be  connected 
without  break  with  the  preceding  verse  (so  Westcott  and 
Hort),  though  Bruce  argues  for  two  parables  here,  the 
former  (verse  24)  about  being  in  earnest,  while  this  one 
(verses  25-30)  about  not  being  too  late.  The  two  points  are 
here  undoubtedly.  It  is  an  awkward  construction,  aph> 
hou  =  apo  toutou  hote  with  an  and  the  aorist  subjunctive 
(egerthei  and  apokleisei).  See  Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  978. 
Hath  shut  to  (apokleisei),  first  aorist  active  subjunctive  of 
apokleio,  old  verb,  but  only  here  in  the  N.T.  Note  effective 
aorist  tense  and  perfective  use  of  apo,  slammed  the  door  fast. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  191 

And  ye  begin  (kai  arxesthe).  First  aorist  middle  subjunctive 
of  archomai  with  apK  hou  an  like  egerthei  and  apokleisei. 
To  stand  (hestanai).  Second  perfect  active  infinitive  of 
histemi,  intransitive  tense  and  to  knock  (kai  krouein).  Pres- 
ent active  infinitive,  to  keep  on  knocking.  Open  to  us 
(anoixon  hemin).  First  aorist  active  imperative,  at  once  and 
urgent.  He  shall  say  (erei).  Future  active  of  eipon  (defective 
verb).    This  is  probably  the  apodosis  of  the  aph'  hou  clause. 

26.  Shall  ye  begin  (arxesthe).  Future  middle,  though  West- 
cott  and  Hort  put  arxesthe  (aorist  middle  subjunctive  of 
archomai)  and  in  that  case  a  continuation  of  the  apK  hou 
construction.  It  is  a  difficult  passage  and  the  copyists  had 
trouble  with  it.  In  thy  presence  (enopion  sou).  As  guests  or 
hosts  or  neighbours  some  claim,  or  the  master  of  the  house. 
It  is  grotesque  to  claim  credit  because  Christ  taught  in  their 
streets,  but  they  are  hard  run  for  excuses  and  claims. 

27.  I  know  not  whence  ye  are  (ouk  oida  pothen  este).  This 
blunt  statement  cuts  the  matter  short  and  sweeps  away  the 
flimsy  cobwebs.  Acquaintance  with  Christ  in  the  flesh  does 
not  open  the  door.  Jesus  quotes  Psa.  8:9  as  in  Matt.  7:23, 
there  as  in  the  LXX,  here  with  pantes  ergatai  adikias,  there 
with  hoi  ergazomenoi  ten  anomian.  But  aposiete  (second 
aorist  active  imperative)  here,  and  there  apochoreite  (present 
active  imperative). 

28.  There  (ekei).  Out  there,  outside  the  house  whence 
they  are  driven.  When  ye  shall  see  (hotan  opsesthe).  First 
aorist  middle  subjunctive  (of  a  late  aorist  bpsamen)  of  horao, 
though  opsesthe  (future  middle)  in  margin  of  Westcott  and 
Hort,  unless  we  admit  here  a  "future"  subjunctive  like 
Byzantine  Greek  (after  Latin).  And  yourselves  cast  forth 
without  (humas  de  ekballomenous  exo).  Present  passive 
participle,  continuous  action,  "you  being  cast  out"  with  the 
door  shut.    See  on  Matt.  8:1  if.  for  this  same  picture. 

29.  Shall  sit  down  (anaklithesontai).  Future  passive  in- 
dicative third  plural.    Recline,  of  course,  is  the  figure  of  this 


192      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

heavenly  banquet.  Jesus  does  not  mean  that  these  will  be 
saved  in  different  ways,  but  only  that  many  will  come  from 
all  the  four  quarters  of  the  earth. 

30.  Last  (eschatoi).  This  saying  was  repeated  many  times 
(Matt.  i9:3o  =  Mark  10:31;  Matt.  20:16). 

31.  In  that  very  hour  (en  autei  tei  hbrai).  Luke's  favourite 
notation  of  time.  Pharisees  (Pharisaioi).  Here  we  see  the 
Pharisees  in  a  new  role,  warning  Jesus  against  the  machina- 
tions of  Herod,  when  they  are  plotting  themselves. 

32.  That  fox  (tei  alopeki  tautei).  This  epithet  for  the  cun- 
ning and  cowardice  of  Herod  shows  clearly  that  Jesus  un- 
derstood the  real  attitude  and  character  of  the  man  who  had 
put  John  the  Baptist  to  death  and  evidently  wanted  to  get 
Jesus  into  his  power  in  spite  of  his  superstitious  fears  that 
he  might  be  John  the  Baptist  redivivus.  The  message  of 
Jesus  means  that  he  is  independent  of  the  plots  and  schemes 
of  both  Herod  and  the  Pharisees.  The  preacher  is  often  put 
in  a  tight  place  by  politicians  who  are  quite  willing  to  see  him 
shorn  of  all  real  power.  Cures  (iaseis).  Old  word,  but  in  the 
N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  4:22,  30.  /  am  perfected  (teleioumai) . 
Present  passive  indicative  of  teleioo,  old  verb  from  teleios,  to 
bring  to  perfection,  frequent  in  the  N.T.  Used  in  Heb.  2:  10 
of  the  Father's  purpose  in  the  humanity  of  Christ.  Perfect 
humanity  is  a  process  and  Jesus  was  passing  through  that, 
without  sin,  but  not  without  temptation  and  suffering.  It 
is  the  prophetic  present  with  the  sense  of  the  future. 

33.  The  day  following  (tei  echomenei).  See  Acts  20:15. 
The  same  as  the  third  day  in  verse  32.  A  proverb.  It  cannot 
be  (ouk  endechetai).  It  is  not  accepted,  it  is  inadmissible. 
A  severely  ironical  indictment  of  Jerusalem.  The  shadow 
of  the  Cross  reaches  Perea  where  Jesus  now  is  as  he  starts 
toward  Jerusalem. 

34.  0  Jerusalem,  Jerusalem  (Ierousalem,  lerousalem). 
In  Matt.  23 :37f.  Jesus  utters  a  similar  lament  over  Jerusa- 
lem.   The  connection  suits  both  there  and  here,  but  Plummer 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  193 

considers  it  "rather  a  violent  hypothesis"  to  suppose  that 
Jesus  spoke  these  words  twice.  It  is  possible,  of  course, 
though  not  like  Luke's  usual  method,  that  he  put  the  words 
here  because  of  the  mention  of  Jerusalem.  In  itself  it  is  not 
easy  to  see  why  Jesus  could  not  have  made  the  lament  both 
here  and  in  Jerusalem.  The  language  of  the  apostrophe  is 
almost  identical  in  both  places  (Luke  13:34^  =  Matt.  23: 
37-39)-  For  details  see  on  Matthew.  In  Luke  we  have 
episunaxai  (late  first  aorist  active  infinitive)  and  in  Matthew 
episunagagein  (second  aorist  active  infinitive),  both  from 
episunago,  a  double  compound  of  late  Greek  (Polybius). 
Both  have  "How  often  would  I"  (posakis  ethelesa).  How 
often  did  I  wish.  Clearly  showing  that  Jesus  made  repeated 
visits  to  Jerusalem  as  we  know  otherwise  only  from  John's 
Gospel.  Even  as  (hon  tropon).  Accusative  of  general  refer- 
ence and  in  Matt.  23:37  also.  Incorporation  of  antecedent 
into  the  relative  clause.  Brood  (nossian)  is  in  Luke  while 
Matthew  has  chickens  (nossia),  both  late  forms  for  the  older 
neossia.  The  adjective  desolate  (eremos)  is  wanting  in  Luke 
13:35  and  is  doubtful  in  Matt.  23:39. 


CHAPTER  XIV 

1.  When  he  went  {en  toi  elthein  auton).  Luke's  favourite 
temporal  clause  =  "on  the  going  as  to  him."  That  (kai). 
Another  common  Lukan  idiom,  kai  =  hoti  after  egeneto,  like 
Hebrew  wav.  They  (autoi).  Emphatic.  Were  watching 
(esanparateroumenoi).  Periphrastic  imperfect  middle.  Note 
force  of  autoi,  middle  voice,  and  para-.  They  were  them- 
selves watching  on  the  side  (on  the  sly),  watching  insidiously, 
with  evil  intent  as  in  Mark  3:2  (active). 

2.  Which  had  the  dropsy  (hudropikos) .  Late  and  medical 
word  from  hudor  (water),  one  who  has  internal  water  (hu- 
drops) .  Here  only  in  the  N.T.  and  only  example  of  the  disease 
healed  by  Jesus  and  recorded. 

3.  Answering  (apokritheis).  First  aorist  passive  participle 
without  the  passive  meaning.  Jesus  answered  the  thoughts 
of  those  mentioned  in  verse  1.  Here  "lawyers  and  Phar- 
isees" are  treated  as  one  class  with  one  article  (tous)  whereas 
in  7:30  they  are  treated  as  two  classes  with  separate  articles. 
Or  not  (e  ou) .  The  dilemma  forestalled  any  question  by  them. 
They  held  their  peace  (hesuchasan).  Ingressive  aorist  active 
of  old  verb  hesuchazo.  They  became  silent,  more  so  than 
before. 

4.  Took  him  (epilabomenos).  Second  aorist  middle  par- 
ticiple of  epilambano,  an  old  verb,  only  in  the  middle  in  the 
N.T.  It  is  not  redundant  use,  "took  and  healed,"  but  "took 
hold  of  him  and  healed  him."  Only  instance  in  the  N.T.  of 
its  use  in  a  case  of  healing.  Let  him  go  (apelusen).  Probably, 
dismissed  from  the  company  to  get  him  away  from  these 
critics. 

5.  An  ass  or  an  ox  (onos  e  bous).  But  Westcott  and  Hort 
huios  e  bous  {a  son  or  an  ox).    The  manuscripts  are  much 

194 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  195 

divided  between  huios  (son)  and  onos  (ass)  which  in  the  ab- 
breviated uncials  looked  much  alike  (TC,  OC)  and  were 
much  alike.  The  sentence  in  the  Greek  reads  literally  thus: 
Whose  ox  or  ass  of  you  shall  fall  (peseitai,  future  middle  of 
pipio)  into  a  well  and  he  (the  man)  will  not  straightway  draw 
him  up  (anaspasei,  future  active  of  anaspao)  on  the  sabbath 
day?  The  very  form  of  the  question  is  a  powerful  argument 
and  puts  the  lawyers  and  the  Pharisees  hopelessly  on  the 
defensive. 

6.  Could  not  answer  again  (ouk  ischusan  antapokrithenai). 
Did  not  have  strength  to  answer  back  or  in  turn  (anti-)  as 
in  Rom.  9:20.  They  could  not  take  up  the  argument  and 
were  helpless.  They  hated  to  admit  that  they  cared  more 
for  an  ox  or  ass  or  even  a  son  than  for  this  poor  dropsical 
man. 

7.  A  parable  for  those  which  were  bidden  {pros  tous  kekle- 
menous  parabolen).  Perfect  passive  participle  of  kaleo,  to 
call,  to  invite.  This  parable  is  for  the  guests  who  were  there 
and  who  had  been  watching  Jesus.  When  he  marked  (epe- 
chon).  Present  active  participle  of  epecho  with  ton  noun 
understood,  holding  the  mind  upon  them,  old  verb  and 
common.  They  chose  out  (exelegonto).  Imperfect  middle, 
were  picking  out  for  themselves.  The  chief  seats  [tas  proto- 
klisias).  The  first  reclining  places  at  the  table.  Jesus  con- 
demned the  Pharisees  later  for  this  very  thing  (Matt.  23 :6  = 
Mark  12:39  =  Luke  20:46).  On  a  couch  holding  three  the 
middle  place  was  the  chief  one.  At  banquets  today  the  name 
of  the  guests  are  usually  placed  at  the  plates.  The  place 
next  to  the  host  on  the  right  was  then,  as  now,  the  post  of 
honour. 

8.  Sit  not  down  (me  kataklitheis) .  First  aorist  (ingressive) 
passive  subjunctive  of  kataklino,  to  recline.  Old  verb,  but 
peculiar  to  Luke  in  the  N.T.  (7:36;  9:14;  14:8;  24:30).  Be 
bidden  (ei  keklemenos).  Periphrastic  perfect  passive  sub- 
junctive of  kaleo  after  me  pote. 


196      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

9.  And  say  {kai  erei).  Changes  to  future  indicative  with 
me  pote  as  in  12:58.  Shalt  begin  with  shame  {arxei  meta 
aischunes).  The  moment  of  embarrassment.  To  take  the 
lowest  place  {ton  eschaton  topon  katechein).  To  hold  down 
the  lowest  place,  all  the  intermediate  ones  being  taken. 

10.  Sit  down  (anapese).  Second  aorist  active  imperative 
of  anapipto,  to  fall  up  or  back,  to  lie  back  or  down.  Late 
Greek  word  for  anaklinb  (cf.  kataklino  in  verse  8).  He  that 
hath  bidden  thee  {ho  keklekos  se).  Perfect  active  participle  as 
in  verse  12  {toi  keklekoti)  with  which  compare  ho  kalesas  in 
verse  9  (first  aorist  active  participle).  He  may  say  {erei). 
The  future  indicative  with  hina  does  occur  in  the  KoinS 
(papyri)  and  so  in  the  N.T.  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  984). 
Go  up  higher  {prosanabethi).  Second  aorist  active  imperative 
second  singular  of  prosanabaino,  an  old  double  compound 
verb,  but  here  cnly  in  the  N.T.  Probably,  "Come  up 
higher,"  because  the  call  comes  from  the  host  and  because 
of  pros. 

11.  Shall  be  humbled  {tapeinbthesetai).  First  future  pas- 
sive. One  of  the  repeated  sayings  of  Jesus  (18:14;  Matt. 
23:12). 

12.  A  dinner  or  a  supper  {ariston  e  deipnon).  More  ex- 
actly, a  breakfast  or  a  dinner  with  distinction  between  them 
as  already  shown.  This  is  a  parable  for  the  host  as  one  had 
just  been  given  for  the  guests,  though  Luke  does  not  term 
this  a  parable.  Call  not  {me  phbnei).  Me  and  the  present 
imperative  active,  prohibiting  the  habit  of  inviting  oaly 
Iriends. Itis  the  exclusive  invitation  of  such  guests  that 
Jesus  condemns.  There  is  a  striking  parallel  to  this  in 
Plato's  Phaedrus  233.  Recompense  {antapodoma) .  In  the 
form  of  a  return  invitation.  Like  anti  in  "bid  thee  again" 
{antikalesosin) . 

13.  When  thou  makest  a  feast  {hotan  dochen  poieis).  Hotan 
and  the  present  subjunctive  in  an  indefinite  temporal  clause. 
Doche  means  reception  as  in  Luke  5:29,  late  word,  only  in 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  197 

these  two  passages  in  the  N.T.  Note  absence  of  article  with 
these  adjectives  in  the  Greek  (poor  people,  maimed  folks, 
lame  people,  blind  people). 

14.  To  recompense  thee  (antapodounai  sot).  Second  aorist 
active  infinitive  of  this  old  and  common  double  compound 
verb,  to  give  back  in  return.  The  reward  will  come  at  the 
resurrection  if  not  before  and  thou  shalt  be  happy. 

15.  Blessed  (makarios) .  Happy,  same  word  in  the  Beati- 
tudes of  Jesus  (Matt.  5 :3ff.)-  This  pious  platitude  whether 
due  to  ignorance  or  hypocrisy  was  called  forth  by  Christ's 
words  about  the  resurrection.  It  was  a  common  figure  among 
the  rabbis,  the  use  of  a  banquet  for  the  bliss  of  heaven.  This 
man  may  mean  that  this  is  a  prerogative  of  the  Pharisees. 
He  assumed  complacently  that  he  will  be  among  the  num- 
ber of  the  blest.  Jesus  himself  uses  this  same  figure  of  the 
spiritual  banquet  for  heavenly  bliss  (Luke  22:29).  Shall  eat 
(phagetai).  Future  middle  from  esthio,  defective  verb,  from 
stem  of  the  aorist  (ephagon)  like  edomai  of  the  old  Greek. 

16.  Made  {epoiei).  Imperfect  active,  was  on  the  point  of 
making  (inchoative).  Great  supper  {deipnon).  Or  dinner, 
a  formal  feast.  Jesus  takes  up  the  conventional  remark  of 
the  guest  and  by  this  parable  shows  that  such  an  attitude 
was  no  guarantee  of  godliness  (Bruce).  This  parable  of  the 
marriage  of  the  King's  son  (Luke  14:15-24)  has  many  points 
of  likeness  to  the  parable  of  the  wedding  garment  (Matt. 
22:1-14)  and  as  many  differences  also.  The  occasions  are 
very  different,  that  in  Matthew  grows  out  of  the  attempt  to 
arrest  Jesus  while  this  one  is  due  to  the  pious  comment  of  a 
guest  at  the  feast  and  the  wording  is  also  quite  different. 
Hence  we  conclude  that  they  are  distinct  parables.  And  he 
bade  many  {kai  ekalesen  pollous).  Aorist  active,  a  distinct 
and  definite  act  following  the  imperfect  epoiei. 

17.  His  servant  {ton  doulon  autou).  His  bondservant. 
Vocator  or  Summoner  (Esth.  5:8;  6:14).  This  second  sum- 
mons was  the  custom  then  as  now  with  wealthy  Arabs. 


198      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Tristram  {Eastern  Customs,  p.  82)  says:  "To  refuse  the 
second  summons  would  be  an  insult,  which  is  equivalent 
among  the  Arab  tribes  to  a  declaration  of  war." 

18.  With  one  consent  (apo  mias).  Some  feminine  sub- 
stantive like  gnomes  or  psuches  has  to  be  supplied.  This 
precise  idiom  occurs  nowhere  else.  It  looked  like  a  con- 
spiracy for  each  one  in  his  turn  did  the  same  thing.  To  make 
excuse  {paraiteisthai).  This  common  Greek  verb  is  used  in 
various  ways,  to  ask  something  from  one  (Mark  15:6),  to 
deprecate  or  ask  to  avert  (Heb.  12:19),  to  refuse  or  decline 
(Acts  25:11),  to  shun  or  to  avoid  (II  Tim.  2:23),  to  beg 
pardon  or  to  make  excuses  for  not  doing  or  to  beg  (Luke 
14:186*".).  All  these  ideas  are  variations  of  aiteo,  to  ask  in  the 
middle  voice  with  para  in  composition.  The  first  {ho  protos). 
In  order  of  time.  There  are  three  of  the  "many"  ("all"), 
whose  excuses  are  given,  each  more  flimsy  than  the  other.  / 
must  needs  {echo  anagken).  I  have  necessity.  The  land 
would  still  be  there,  a  strange  "necessity."  Have  me  excused 
{eche  me  pareitemenon).  An  unusual  idiom  somewhat  like 
the  English  perfect  with  the  auxiliary  "have"  and  the  mod- 
ern Greek  idiom  with  echo,  but  certainly  not  here  a 
Greek  periphrasis  for  pareiteso.  This  perfect  passive  parti- 
ciple is  predicate  and  agrees  with  me.  See  a  like  idiom  in 
Mark  3:1;  Luke  12:19  (Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  902L). 
The  Latin  had  a  similar  idiom,  habe  me  excusatum.  Same 
language  in  verse  19. 

19.  To  prove  them  {dokimasai  auto).  He  could  have  tested 
them  before  buying.  The  oxen  would  not  run  away  or  be 
stolen. 

20.  /  cannot  come  {ou  dunamai  elthein).  Less  polite  than 
the  others  but  a  more  plausible  pretence  if  he  wanted  to  make 
it  so.  The  law  excused  a  newly  married  man  from  war 
(Deut.  24:5),  "but  not  from  social  courtesy"  (Ragg).  The 
new  wife  would  probably  have  been  glad  to  go  with  him  to 
the  feast  if  asked.     But  see  I  Cor.  7:33.    There  is  here  as 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  199 

often  a  sharp  difference  between  the  excuses  offered  and  the 
reasons  behind  them. 

21.  Being  angry  (orgistheis).  First  aorist  (ingressive) 
passive,  becoming  angry.  Quickly  (tachebs).  The  dinner  is 
ready  and  no  time  is  to  be  lost.  The  invitation  goes  still 
to  those  in  the  city.  Streets  and  lanes  (tas  plateias  kai  rhumas) . 
Broadways  and  runways  (broad  streets  and  narrow  lanes). 
Maimed  (anapeirous).  So  Westcott  and  Hort  for  the  old 
word  anaperous,  due  to  itacism  (ei=e  in  pronunciation). 
The  word  is  compounded  of  ana  and  peros,  lame  all  the  way 

up- 

22.  And  yet  there  is  room  {kai  eti  topos  estin).  The  Master 
had  invited  "many"  (verse  16)  who  had  all  declined.  The 
servant  knew  the  Master  wished  the  places  to  be  filled. 

23.  The  highways  and  hedges  (tas  hodous  kai  phragmous). 
The  public  roads  outside  the  city  of  Judaism  just  as  the 
streets  and  lanes  were  inside  the  city.  The  heathen  are  to  be 
invited  this  time.  Hedges  is  fenced  in  places  from  phrasso, 
to  fence  in  (Rom.  3:19).  Compel  (anagkason).  First  aorist 
active  imperative  of  anagkazo,  from  anagke  (verse  18).  By 
persuasion  of  course.  There  is  no  thought  of  compulsory  sal- 
vation. "Not  to  use  force,  but  to  constrain  them  against  the 
reluctance  which  such  poor  creatures  would  feel  at  accept- 
ing the  invitation  of  a  great  lord"  (Vincent).  As  examples 
of  such  "constraint"  in  this  verb  see  Matt.  14:22;  Acts 
26:11;  Gal.  6:12.  That  my  house  may  be  filled  (hina  gemisthei 
mou  ho  oikos).  First  aorist  passive  subjunctive  of  gemizo, 
to  fill  full,  old  verb  from  gemo,  to  be  full.  Effective  aorist. 
Subjunctive  with  hina  in  final  clause.  The  Gentiles  are  to 
take  the  place  that  the  Jews  might  have  had  (Rom.  11:25). 
Bengel  says:  Nee  natura  nee  gratia  patitur  vacuum. 

24.  My  supper  (mou  tou  deipnou).  Here  it  is  still  the 
Master  of  the  feast  who  is  summing  up  his  reasons  for  his 
conduct.  We  do  not  have  to  say  that  Jesus  shuts  the  door 
now  in  the  face  of  the  Jews  who  may  turn  to  him. 


200      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

25.  And  he  turned  {kai  strapheis).  Second  aorist  passive 
participle  of  strepho,  common  verb.  It  is  a  dramatic  act  on 
the  part  of  Jesus,  a  deliberate  effort  to  check  the  wild  and 
unthinking  enthusiasm  of  the  crowds  who  followed  just  to 
be  following.  Note  "many  multitudes"  {ochloi  polloi)  and 
the  imperfect  tense  suneporeuonto,  were  going  along  with 
him. 

26.  Hateth  not  {ou  misei).  An  old  and  very  strong  verb 
miseo,  to  hate,  detest.  The  orientals  use  strong  language 
where  cooler  spirits  would  speak  of  preference  or  indifference. 
But  even  so  Jesus  does  not  here  mean  that  one  must  hate  his 
father  or  mother  of  necessity  or  as  such,  for  Matt.  15 14  proves 
the  opposite.  It  is  only  where  the  element  of  choice  comes 
in  (cf.  Matt.  6:24)  as  it  sometimes  does,  when  father  or 
mother  opposes  Christ.  Then  one  must  not  hesitate.  The 
language  here  is  more  sharply  put  than  in  Matt.  10:37.  The 
ou  here  coalesces  with  the  verb  misei  in  this  conditional 
clause  of  the  first  class  determined  as  fulfilled.  It  is  the 
language  of  exaggerated  contrast,  it  is  true,  but  it  must  not 
be  watered  down  till  the  point  is  gone.  In  mentioning  "and 
wife"  Jesus  has  really  made  a  comment  on  the  excuse  given 
in  verse  20  (I  married  a  wife  and  so  I  am  not  able  to  come). 
And  his  own  life  also  (eti  te  kai  ten  psuchen  heautou).  Note 
te  kai,  both — and.  "The  te  (B  L)  binds  all  the  particulars  into 
one  bundle  of  renuncianda"  (Bruce).  Note  this  same  triple 
group  of  conjunctions  {eti  te  kai)  in  Acts  21:28,  "And  more- 
over also,"  "even  going  as  far  as  his  own  life."  Martyrdom 
should  be  an  ever-present  possibility  to  the  Christian,  not  to 
be  courted,  but  not  to  be  shunned.  Love  for  Christ  takes 
precedence  "over  even  the  elemental  instinct  of  self-preser- 
vation" (Ragg). 

27.  His  own  cross  {ton  stauron  heautou).  This  familiar 
figure  we  have  had  already  (Luke  9:23;  Mark  8:34;  Matt. 
10:38;  16:24).  Each  follower  has  a  cross  which  he  must  bear 
as  Jesus  did  his.     Bastazb  is  used  of  cross  bearing  in  the  N.T. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  201 

only  here  (figuratively)  and  John  19:17  literally  of  Jesus. 
Crucifixion  was  common  enough  in  Palestine  since  the  days 
of  Antiochus  Epiphanes  and  Alexander  Jannaeus. 

28.  Build  a  tower  (purgon  oikodomesai).  A  common 
metaphor,  either  a  tower  in  the  city  wall  like  that  by  the 
Pool  of  Siloam  (Luke  13:4)  or  a  watchtower  in  a  vineyard 
(Matt.  21:33)  or  a  tower-shaped  building  for  refuge  or  or- 
nament as  here.  This  parable  of  the  rash  builder  has  the 
lesson  of  counting  the  cost.  Sit  down  (kathisas).  Attitude  of 
deliberation.  First  {proton).  First  things  first.  So  in  verse 
31.  Count  (psephizei).  Common  verb  in  late  writers,  but 
only  here  and  Rev.  13:18  in  the  N.T.  The  verb  is  from 
psephos,  a  stone,  which  was  used  in  voting  and  so  counting. 
Calculate  is  from  the  Latin  calculus,  a  pebble.  To  vote  was 
to  cast  a  pebble  (tithemi psephon).  Luke  has  Paul  using  "de- 
posit a  pebble"  for  casting  his  vote  (Acts  26:10).  The  cost 
(ten  dapanen).  Old  and  common  word,  but  here  only  in  the 
N.T.  from  dapto,  to  tear,  consume,  devour.  Expense  is 
something  which  eats  up  one's  resources.  Whether  he  hath 
wherewith  to  complete  it  (ei  echei  eis  apartismon).  If  he  has 
anything  for  completion  of  it.  Apartismon  is  a  rare  and  late 
word  (in  the  papyri  and  only  here  in  the  N.T.).  It  is  from 
apartizo,  to  finish  off  (ap-  and  artizo  like  our  articulate),  to 
make  even  or  square.    Cf.  exertismenos  in  II  Tim.  3:17. 

29.  Lest  haply  (hina  mepote).  Double  final  particles  (posi- 
tive and  negative  with  addition  of  pote).  Used  here  with 
aorist  middle  subjunctive  in  arxontai  (begin).  When  he  hath 
laid  .  .  .  and  was  not  able  (thentos  autou  .  .  .  kai  me  ischu- 
ontos)  to  finish  (ektelesai).  First  aorist  active  infinitive. 
Note  perfective  use  of  ek,  to  finish  out  to  the  end.  Two 
genitive  absolutes,  first,  second  aorist  active  participle 
thentos;  second,  present  active  participle  ischuontos.  To 
mock  him  (autoi  empaizein).  An  old  verb,  em-paizb,  to  play 
like  a  child  (pais),  at  or  with,  to  mock,  scoff  at,  to  trifle 
with  like  Latin  illudere. 


202      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

30.  This  man  (houtos  ho  anthropos).  This  fellow,  contemp- 
tuous or  sarcastic  use  of  houtos. 

31.  To  encounter  (sunbalein).  Second  aorist  active  in- 
finitive of  sunballo,  old  and  common  verb,  to  throw  or  bring 
together,  to  dispute,  to  clash  in  war  as  here.  Another  king 
(heterbi  basilei),  to  grapple  with  another  king  in  war  or  for  war 
(eis  polemon).  Associative  instrumental  case.  Take  counsel 
(bouleusetai) .  Future  middle  indicative  of  old  and  common 
verb  bouleuo,  from  boule,  will,  counsel.  The  middle  means  to 
take  counsel  with  oneself,  to  deliberate,  to  ponder.  With  ten 
thousand  {en  deka  chiliasin).  Literally,  in  ten  thousand. 
See  this  so-called  instrumental  use  of  en  in  Jude  14. 
Equipped  in  or  with  ten  thousand.  See  Luke  1:17.  Note 
meta  eikosi  chiliadon  just  below  (midst  of  twenty  thousand). 
To  meet  (hupantesai).  Common  verb  (like  apantao)  from 
antao  (anta,  end,  face  to  face,  from  which  anti)  with  preposi- 
tion hupo  (or  apo),  to  go  to  meet.  Here  it  has  a  military 
meaning. 

32.  Or  else  {ei  de  mege).  Same  idiom  in  5  '.^6.  Luke  is  fond 
of  this  formula.  An  ambassage  (presbeian) .  Old  and  com- 
mon word  for  the  office  of  ambassador,  composed  of  old  men 
(presbeis)  like  Japanese  Elder  Statesmen  who  are  supposed 
to  possess  wisdom.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  19:14. 
Asketh  conditions  of  peace  (erbtai  pros  eirenen).  The  use  of 
erotao  in  this  sense  of  beg  or  petition  is  common  in  the  papyri 
and  Koine  generally.  The  original  use  of  asking  a  question 
survives  also.  The  text  is  uncertain  concerning  pros  eirenen 
which  means  with  erotao,  to  ask  negotiations  for  peace.  In 
B  we  have  eis  instead  of  pros  like  verse  28.  Most  MSS.  have 
ta  before  pros  or  eis,  but  not  in  Aleph  and  B.  It  is  possible 
that  the  ta  was  omitted  because  of  preceding  tai  (homoeote- 
leuton),  but  the  sense  is  the  same.  See  Rom.  14:19  ta  tes 
eirenes,  the  things  of  peace,  which  concern  or  look  towards 
peace,  the  preliminaries  of  peace. 

33.  Renounceth  not  {ouk  apotassetai).    Old  Greek  word  to 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  203 

set  apart  as  in  a  military  camp,  then  in  the  middle  voice  to 
separate  oneself  from,  say  good-bye  to  (Luke  9:61),  to  re- 
nounce, forsake,  as  here.  All  that  he  hath  (pasin  tots  heautou 
huparchousin).  Dative  case,  says  good-bye  to  all  his  prop- 
erty, "all  his  own  belongings"  (neuter  plural  participle  used 
as  substantive)  as  named  in  verse  26.  This  verse  gives  the 
principle  in  the  two  parables  of  the  rash  builder  and  of  the 
rash  king.  The  minor  details  do  not  matter.  The  spirit  of 
self-sacrifice  is  the  point. 

35.  Dunghill  (koprian).  Later  word  in  the  Ko ine  vernac- 
ular. Here  only  in  the  N.T.,  though  in  the  LXX.  Men  cast 
it  out  (exo  ballousin  auto).  Impersonal  plural.  This  saying 
about  salt  is  another  of  Christ's  repeated  sayings  (Matt. 
5:13;  Mark  9:50).  Another  repeated  saying  is  the  one  here 
about  having  ears  to  hear  (Luke  8:8;  14:35,  Matt.  11:15, 
I3:43)- 


CHAPTER  XV 

1.  All  the  publicans  and  sinners  (pantes  hoi  telonai  kai  hoi 
hamartoloi).  The  two  articles  separate  the  two  classes  (all 
the  publicans  and  the  sinners).  They  are  sometimes  grouped 
together  (5:30;  Matt.  9:11),  but  not  here.  The  publicans 
are  put  on  the  same  level  with  the  outcasts  or  sinners.  So 
in  verse  2  the  repeated  article  separates  Pharisees  and  scribes 
as  not  quite  one.  The  use  of  "all"  here  may  be  hyperbole 
for  very  many  or  the  reference  may  be  to  these  two  classes 
in  the  particular  place  where  Jesus  was  from  time  to  time. 
Were  drawing  near  unto  him  (esan  auibi  eggizontes).  Peri- 
phrastic imperfect  of  eggizo,  from  eggus  (near),  late  verb. 
For  to  hear  (akouein).  Just  the  present  active  infinitive  of 
purpose. 

2.  Both  .  .  .  and  {te  .  .  .  kai).  United  in  the  complaint. 
Murmured  (diegogguzon) .  Imperfect  active  of  diagogguzo,  late 
Greek  compound  in  the  LXX  and  Byzantine  writers.  In 
the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  19:7.  The  force  of  dia  here  is 
probably  between  or  among  themselves.  It  spread  (imper- 
fect tense)  whenever  these  two  classes  came  in  contact  with 
Jesus.  As  the  publicans  and  the  sinners  were  drawing  near  to 
Jesus  just  in  that  proportion  the  Pharisees  and  the  scribes 
increased  their  murmurings.  The  social  breach  is  here  an 
open  yawning  chasm.  This  man  Qioutos).  A  contemptuous 
sneer  in  the  use  of  the  pronoun.  They  spoke  out  openly  and 
probably  pointed  at  Jesus.  Receiveth  (prosdechetai).  Present 
middle  indicative  of  the  common  verb  prosdechomai.  In 
12:36  we  had  it  for  expecting,  here  it  is  to  give  access  to  one- 
self, to  welcome  like  hupedexato  of  Martha's  welcome  to 
Jesus  (Luke  10:38).  The  charge  here  is  that  this  is  the  habit 
of  Jesus.  He  shows  no  sense  of  social  superiority  to  these 
outcasts  (like  the  Hindu  "untouchables"  in  India).     And 

204 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  205 

eateth  with  them  {kai  sunesthiei  autois).  Associative  instru- 
mental case  {autois)  after  sun-  in  composition.  This  is  an 
old  charge  (Luke  5 130)  and  a  much  more  serious  breach  from 
the  standpoint  of  the  Pharisees.  The  implication  is  that 
Jesus  prefers  these  outcasts  to  the  respectable  classes  (the 
Pharisees  and  the  scribes)  because  he  is  like  them  in  character 
and  tastes,  even  with  the  harlots.  There  was  a  sting  in  the 
charge  that  he  was  the  "friend"  {philos)  of  publicans  and 
sinners  (Luke  7:34). 

3.  This  parable  {ten  parabolen  tauten).  The  Parable  of  the 
Lost  Sheep  (15:3-7).  This  is  Christ's  way  of  answering  the 
cavilling  of  these  chronic  complainers.  Jesus  gave  this  same 
parable  for  another  purpose  in  another  connection  (Matt. 
18:12-14).  The  figure  of  the  Good  Shepherd  appears  also  in 
John  10:1-18.  "No  simile  has  taken  more  hold  upon  the 
mind  of  Christendom  "  (Plummer) .  Jesus  champions  the  lost 
and  accepts  the  challenge  and  justifies  his  conduct  by  these 
superb  stories.  "The  three  Episodes  form  a  climax:  The 
Pasture — the  House — the  Home;  the  Herdsman — the  House- 
wife— the  Father;  the  Sheep — the  Treasure — the  Beloved 
Son"  (Ragg). 

4.  In  the  wilderness  {en  tei  eremoi).  Their  usual  pasturage, 
not  a  place  of  danger  or  peril.  It  is  the  owner  of  the  hundred 
sheep  who  cares  so  much  for  the  one  that  is  lost.  He  knows 
each  one  of  the  sheep  and  loves  each  one.  Go  after  that  which 
is  lost  {poreuetai  epi  to  apololos).  The  one  lost  sheep  {apololos, 
second  perfect  active  participle  of  apollumi,  to  destroy,  but 
intransitive,  to  be  lost).  There  is  nothing  more  helpless  than 
a  lost  sheep  except  a  lost  sinner.  The  sheep  went  off  by  its 
own  ignorance  and  folly.  The  use  of  epi  for  the  goal  occurs 
also  in  Matt.  22:9;  Acts  8:26;  9:11.  Until  he  find  it  {hebs 
heurei  auto).  Second  aorist  active  subjunctive  of  heurisko, 
common  verb,  with  heos,  common  Greek  idiom.  He  keeps  on 
going  {poreuetai,  linear  present  middle  indicative)  until  suc- 
cess comes  (effective  aorist,  heurei). 


206      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

5.  On  his  shoulders  (epi  tous  omous  autou).  He  does  it 
himself  in  exuberant  affection  and  of  necessity  as  the  poor 
lost  sheep  is  helpless.  Note  the  plural  shoulders  showing  that 
the  sheep  was  just  back  of  the  shepherd's  neck  and  drawn 
around  by  both  hands.  The  word  for  shoulder  (omos)  is  old 
and  common,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Matt.  23:4. 
Rejoicing  (chairbn).  "There  is  no  upbraiding  of  the  wander- 
ing sheep,  nor  murmuring  at  the  trouble"  (Plummer). 

6.  Rejoice  with  me  (suncharete  moi).  Second  aorist  passive 
of  sunchairo,  an  old  and  common  verb  for  mutual  joy  as  in 
Phil.  2:iyi.  Joy  demands  fellowship.  Same  form  in  verse 
9.  So  the  shepherd  calls  together  (sunkalei,  note  sun  again) 
both  his  friends  and  his  neighbours.  This  picture  of  the  Good 
Shepherd  has  captured  the  eye  of  many  artists  through  the 
ages. 

7.  Over  one  sinner  that  repenteth  (epi  heni  hamartbloi 
metanoounti) .  The  word  sinner  points  to  verse  1.  Repenting 
is  what  these  sinners  were  doing,  these  lost  sheep  brought 
to  the  fold.  The  joy  in  heaven  is  in  contrast  with  the  grum- 
bling Pharisees  and  scribes.  More  than  over  (e  epi).  There  is 
no  comparative  in  the  Greek.  It  is  only  implied  by  a  com- 
mon idiom  like  our  "rather  than."  Which  need  no  repentance 
(hoitines  ou  chreian  echousin  metanoias).  Jesus  does  not 
mean  to  say  that  the  Pharisees  and  the  scribes  do  not  need 
repentance  or  are  perfect.  He  for  the  sake  of  argument 
accepts  their  claims  about  themselves  and  by  their  own 
words  condemns  them  for  their  criticism  of  his  efforts  to 
save  the  lost  sheep.  It  is  the  same  point  that  he  made  against 
them  when  they  criticized  Jesus  and  the  disciples  for  being 
at  Levi's  feast  (Luke  5 13 if.).  They  posed  as  "righteous." 
Very  well,  then.  That  shuts  their  mouths  on  the  point  of 
Christ's  saving  the  publicans  and  sinners. 

8.  Ten  pieces  of  silver  (drachmas  deka).  The  only  instance 
in  the  N.T.  of  this  old  word  for  a  coin  of  65.5  grains  about 
the  value  of  the  common  denarius  (about  eighteen  cents), 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  207 

a  quarter  of  a  Jewish  shekel.  The  double  drachma  (di- 
drachmon)  occurs  in  the  N.T.  only  in  Matt.  17:24.  The  root 
is  from  drassomai,  to  grasp  with  the  hand  (I  Cor.  3  119),  and 
so  a  handful  of  coin.  Ten  drachmas  would  be  equal  to  nearly 
two  dollars,  but  in  purchasing  power  much  more.  Sweep 
(saroi).  A  late  colloquial  verb  saroo  for  the  earlier  sairo,  to 
clear  by  sweeping.  Three  times  in  the  N.T.  (Luke  11:25; 
15:8;  Matt.  12:44).  The  house  was  probably  without  win- 
dows (only  the  door  for  light  and  hence  the  lamp  lit)  and 
probably  also  a  dirt  floor.  Hence  Bengel  says:  non  sine 
pulvere.    This  parable  is  peculiar  to  Luke. 

9.  Her  friends  and  neighbours  (tas  philas  kai  geitonas) .  Note 
single  article  and  female  friends  (feminine  article  and  philas). 
Heos  hou  eurei  here  as  in  verse  4,  only  hou  added  after  heos 
(until  which  time)  as  often.  Which  I  lost  {hen  apblesa). 
First  aorist  active  indicative  of  apollumi.  She  lost  the  coin 
(note  article) .    The  shepherd  did  not  lose  the  one  sheep. 

10.  There  is  joy  (ginetai  char  a).  More  exactly,  joy  arises. 
Futuristic  present  of  ginomai  (cf.  estai  in  verse  7).  In  the 
presence  of  the  angels  of  God  (enopion  ton  aggelon  tou  theou). 
That  is  to  say,  the  joy  of  God  himself.  The  angels  are  in  a 
sense  the  neighbours  of  God. 

11.  Had  (eichen).  Imperfect  active.  Note  echon  (verse 
4),  echousa  (verse  8),  and  now  eichen.  The  self-sacrificing 
care  is  that  of  the  owner  in  each  case.  Here  (verses  II  to  32) 
we  have  the  most  famous  of  all  the  parables  of  Jesus,  the 
Prodigal  Son,  which  is  in  Luke  alone.  We  have  had  the 
Lost  Sheep,  the  Lost  Coin,  and  now  the  Lost  Son.  Bruce 
notes  that  in  the  moral  sphere  there  must  be  self-recovery  to 
give  ethical  value  to  the  rescue  of  the  son  who  wandered 
away.    That  comes  out  beautifully  in  this  allegory. 

12.  The  portion  (to  meros).  The  Jewish  law  alloted  one- 
half  as  much  to  the  younger  son  as  to  the  elder,  that  is  to 
say  one-third  of  the  estate  (Deut.  21:17)  at  tne  death  of  the 
father.    The  father  did  not  have  to  abdicate  in  favour  of  the 


208      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

sons,  but  "this  very  human  parable  here  depicts  the  im- 
patience of  home  restraints  and  the  optimistic  ambition  of 
youth"  (Ragg).  And  he  divided  (ho  de  dieilen).  The  second 
aorist  active  indicative  of  diaireb,  an  old  and  common  verb 
to  part  in  two,  cut  asunder,  divide,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here 
and  I  Cor.  12:11.  The  elder  son  got  his  share  also  of  the 
"substance"  or  property  or  estate  (tes  ousias),  "the  living" 
(ton  bion)  as  in  Mark  12:44,  not  "life"  as  in  Luke  8:14. 

13.  Not  many  days  after  (met*  ou  pollas  hemeras).  Liter- 
ally, after  not  many  days.  Luke  is  fond  of  this  idiom  (7:6; 
Acts  1:5).  Took  his  journey  (apedemesen).  First  aorist 
active  indicative  of  apodemeb  (from  apodemos,  away  from 
home).  Common  verb.  In  the  N.T.  here  and  Matt.  21 133; 
25:14;  Mark  12:1;  Luke  20:9.  He  burned  all  his  bridges 
behind  him,  gathering  together  all  that  he  had.  Wasted 
(dieskorpisen).  First  aorist  active  indicative  of  diaskorpizo, 
a  somewhat  rare  verb,  the  very  opposite  of  "gathered  to- 
gether" (sunagogbn).  More  exactly  he  scattered  his  prop- 
erty. It  is  the  word  used  of  winnowing  grain  (Matt.  25:24). 
With  riotous  living  (zbn  asbtbs).  Living  dissolutely  or  prof- 
ligately. The  late  adverb  asbtbs  (only  here  in  the  N.T.)  from 
the  common  adjective  asbtos  (a  privative  and  sbzb),  one 
that  cannot  be  saved,  one  who  does  not  save,  a  spendthrift, 
an  abandoned  man,  a  profligate,  a  prodigal.  He  went  the 
limit  of  sinful  excesses.  It  makes  sense  taken  actively  or 
passively  (prodigus  or  perditus),  active  probably  here. 

14.  When  he  had  spent  (dapanesantos  autou).  Genitive  ab- 
solute. The  verb  is  here  used  in  a  bad  sense  as  in  James  4:3. 
See  on  dapane  Luke  14:28.  He  (autos).  Emphasis.  To  be 
in  want  (hustereisthai).  The  verb  is  from  husteros,  behind  or 
later  (comparative).  We  use  "fall  behind"  (Vincent)  of 
one  in  straitened  circumstances.  Plummer  notes  the  coinci- 
dences of  Providence.  The  very  land  was  in  a  famine  when 
the  boy  had  spent  all. 

15.  Joined   himself   (ekollethe).      First   aorist   passive   of 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  209 

kollao,  an  old  verb  to  glue  together,  to  cleave  to.  In  the  N.T. 
only  the  passive  occurs.  He  was  glued  to,  was  joined  to. 
It  is  not  necessary  to  take  this  passive  in  the  middle  re- 
flexive sense.  The  citizens  (ton  politon).  Curiously  enough 
this  common  word  citizen  (polites  from  polis,  city)  is  found 
in  the  N.T.  only  in  Luke's  writings  (15:15;  19:14;  Acts  21  39) 
except  in  Heb.  8:11  where  it  is  quoted  from  Jer.  38:34.  To 
feed  swine  (boskein  choir ous).  A  most  degrading  occupation 
for  anyone  and  for  a  Jew  an  unspeakable  degradation. 

16.  He  would  fain  have  been  filled  (epethumei  chortasthenai) . 
Literally,  he  was  desiring  (longing)  to  be  filled.  Imperfect 
indicative  and  first  aorist  passive  infinitive.  Chortasthenai 
is  from  chortazo  and  that  from  chortos  (grass),  and  so  to  feed 
with  grass  or  with  anything.  Westcott  and  Hort  put  gemisai 
ten  koilian  autou  in  the  margin  (the  Textus  Receptus). 
With  the  husks  (ek  ton  keration).  The  word  occurs  here  alone 
in  the  N.T.  and  is  a  diminutive  of  keras  (horn)  and  so  means 
little  horn.  It  is  used  in  various  senses,  but  here  refers  to  the 
pods  of  the  carob  tree  or  locust  tree  still  common  in  Palestine 
and  around  the  Mediterannean,  so  called  from  the  shape  of 
the  pods  like  little  horns,  Bockshornbaum  in  German  or 
goat's-horn  tree.  The  gelatinous  substance  inside  has  a 
sweetish  taste  and  is  used  for  feeding  swine  and  even  for 
food  by  the  lower  classes.  It  is  sometimes  called  Saint 
John's  Bread  from  the  notion  that  the  Baptist  ate  it  in  the 
wilderness.  No  man  gave  unto  him  (oudeis  edidou  autoi). 
Imperfect  active.  Continued  refusal  of  anyone  to  allow  him 
even  the  food  of  the  hogs. 

17.  But  when  he  came  to  himself  (eis  heauton  de  elthon). 
As  if  he  had  been  far  from  himself  as  he  was  from  home.  As 
a  matter  of  fact  he  had  been  away,  out  of  his  head,  and  now 
began  to  see  things  as  they  really  were.  Plato  is  quoted  by 
Ackerman  (Christian  Element  in  Plato)  as  thinking  of  re- 
demption as  coming  to  oneself.  Hired  servants  (misthioi). 
A  late  word  from  misthos  (hire).      In  the  N.T.  only  in  this 


210      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

chapter.  The  use  of  "many"  here  suggests  a  wealthy  and 
luxurious  home.  Have  bread  enough  and  to  spare  (perisseuon- 
tai  artbn).  Old  verb  from  peris sos  and  that  from  peri 
(around).  Present  passive  here,  "are  surrounded  by  loaves" 
like  a  flood.  /  perish  (ego  de  limbi  hbde  apollumai).  Every 
word  here  counts :  While  I  on  the  other  hand  am  here  perish- 
ing with  hunger.  It  is  the  linear  present  middle  of  apollumi. 
Note  ego  expressed  and  de  of  contrast. 

1 8.  /  will  arise  and  go  (anastas  proreusomai).  This  deter- 
mination is  the  act  of  the  will  after  he  comes  to  himself  and 
sees  his  real  condition.  /  did  sin  (hemarton) .  That  is  the 
hard  word  to  say  and  he  will  say  it  first.  The  word  means  to 
miss  the  mark.  I  shot  my  bolt  and  I  missed  my  aim  (com- 
pare the  high-handed  demand  in  verse  12). 

19.  No  longer  worthy  (ouketi  axios).  Confession  of  the 
facts.  He  sees  his  own  pitiful  plight  and  is  humble.  As  one 
(hos  hena).  The  hired  servants  in  his  father's  house  are  high 
above  him  now. 

20.  To  his  father  (pros  ton  patera  heautou).  Literally,  to 
his  own  father.  He  acted  at  once  on  his  decision.  Yet 
afar  off  (eti  autou  makran  apechontos).  Genitive  absolute. 
Makran  agrees  with  hodon  understood:  While  he  was  yet 
holding  off  a  distant  way.  This  shows  that  the  father  had 
been  looking  for  him  to  come  back  and  was  even  looking  at 
this  very  moment  as  he  came  in  sight.  Ran  (drambn). 
Second  aorist  active  participle  of  the  defective  verb  trecho. 
The  eager  look  and  longing  of  the  father.  Kissed  (katephile- 
jen).  Note  perfective  use  of  kata  kissed  him  much,  kissed 
him  again  and  again.    The  verb  occurs  so  in  the  older  Greek. 

21.  The  son  made  his  speech  of  confession  as  planned, 
but  it  is  not  certain  that  he  was  able  to  finish  as  a  number  of 
early  manuscripts  do  not  have  "Make  me  as  one  of  the  hired 
servants,"  though  Aleph  B  D  do  have  them.  It  is  probable 
that  the  father  interrupted  him  at  this  point  before  he  could 
finish. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  211 

22.  The  best  robe  {stolen  ten  proten).  Stole  is  an  old  word 
for  a  fine  stately  garment  that  comes  down  to  the  feet  (from 
stello,  to  prepare,  equip),  the  kind  worn  by  kings  (Mark  16:5; 
Luke  22:46).  Literally,  "a  robe  the  first."  But  not  the 
first  that  you  find,  but  the  first  in  rank  and  value,  the  finest 
in  the  house.  This  in  contrast  with  his  shabby  clothes. 
A  ring  (daktulion) .  Common  in  classical  writers  and  the 
LXX,  but  here  only  in  the  N.T.  From  daktulos,  finger. 
See  chrusodaktulios  in  James  2 :2.  Shoes  (hupodemata) .  San- 
dals, "bound  under."  Both  sandals  and  ring  are  marks 
of  the  freeman  as  slaves  were  barefooted. 

23.  The  fatted  calf  {ton  moschon  ton  siteuton).  The  calf 
the  fatted  one.  Siteuton  is  the  verbal  adjective  of  siteub,  to 
feed  with  wheat  {sitos).  The  calf  was  kept  fat  for  festive 
occasions,  possibly  in  the  hope  of  the  son's  return.  Kill 
{thus ate).  Not  as  a  sacrifice,  but  for  the  feast.  Make  merry 
{euphranthbmen) .  First  aorist  passive  subjunctive  (volitive). 
From  euphrainb,  an  old  verb  from  eu  (well)  and  phren  (mind). 

24.  And  is  alive  {kai  anezesen).  First  aorist  active  indica- 
tive of  anazao,  to  live  again.  Literally,  he  was  dead  and  he 
came  back  to  life.  He  was  lost  {en  apololos,  periphrastic  past 
perfect  active  of  apollumi  and  intransitive,  in  a  lost  state) 
and  he  was  found  {heurethe).  He  was  found,  we  have  to  say, 
but  this  aorist  passive  is  really  timeless,  he  is  found  after  long 
waiting  (effective  aorist)  The  artists  have  vied  with  each 
other  in  picturing  various  items  connected  with  this  wonder- 
ful parable. 

25.  As  he  came  and  drew  nigh  {hos  erchomenos  eggisen). 
More  exactly,  "As,  coming,  he  drew  nigh,"  for  erchomenos 
is  present  middle  participle  and  eggisen  is  aorist  active  indica- 
tive. Music  {sumphbnias).  Our  word  "symphony."  An 
old  Greek  word  from  sumphbnos  {sun,  together,  and  phone, 
voice  or  sound),  harmony,  concord,  by  a  band  of  musicians. 
Here  alone  in  the  N.T.  And  dancing  {kai  chorbn).  An  old 
word  again,  but  here  alone  in  the  N.T.     Origin  uncertain, 


212      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

possibly  from  orchos  by  metathesis  (orcheomai,  to  dance). 
A  circular  dance  on  the  green. 

26.  Servants  (paidon).  Not  douloi  (bondslaves)  as  in  verse 
22.  The  Greeks  often  used  pais  for  servant  like  the  Latin 
puer.  It  could  be  either  a  hired  servant  (misthios,  verse  17) 
or  slave  (doulos).  He  inquired  (epunlhaneto).  Imperfect 
middle,  inquired  repeatedly  and  eagerly.  What  these  things 
might  be  (ti  an  eie  tauta).  Not  "poor"  Greek  as  Easton  holds, 
but  simply  the  form  of  the  direct  question  retained  in  the 
indirect.  See  the  direct  form  as  the  apodosis  of  a  condition 
of  the  fourth  class  in  Acts  17:18.  In  Acts  10:17  we  have  the 
construction  with  an  eie  of  the  direct  retained  in  the  indirect 
question.  So  also  in  Luke  1:62:  See  Robertson,  Grammar, 
p.   1044. 

27.  Is  come  (hekei).  Present  indicative  active,  but  a  stem 
with  perfect  sense,  old  verb  heko  retaining  this  use  after 
perfect  tenses  came  into  use  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  893). 
Hath  killed  (ethusen).  Aorist  active  indicative  and  literally 
means,  did  kill.  Difficult  to  handle  in  English  for  our  tenses 
do  not  correspond  with  the  Greek.  Hath  received  (apelaben). 
Second  aorist  active  indicative  with  similar  difficulty  of 
translation.  Note  apo  in  compositions,  like  re-  in  "receive," 
hath  gotten  him  back  (ap-).  Safe  and  sound  (hugiainonta) . 
Present  active  participle  of  hugiainb  from  hugies,  to  be  in 
good  health.  In  spite  of  all  that  he  has  gone  through  and  in 
spite  of  the  father's  fears. 

28.  But  he  was  angry  (orgisthe).  First  aorist  (ingressive) 
passive  indicative.  But  he  became  angry,  he  flew  into  a 
rage  (orge).  This  was  the  explosion  as  the  result  of  long 
resentment  towards  the  wayward  brother  and  suspicion  of 
the  father's  partiality  for  the  erring  son.  Would  not  go  in 
(ouk  ethelen  eiselthein).  Imperfect  tense  (was  not  willing, 
refused)  and  aorist  active  (ingressive)  infinitive.  Entreated 
(parekalei).     Imperfect  tense,  he  kept  on  beseeching  him. 

29.  Do  I  serve  thee  (douleuo  soi).    Progressive  present  tense 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  213 

of  this  old  verb  from  doulos  (slave)  which  the  elder  son  uses 
to  picture  his  virtual  slavery  in  staying  at  home  and  perhaps 
with  longings  to  follow  the  younger  son  (Robertson,  Gram- 
mar, p.  879).  Transgressed  (parelthon).  Second  aorist  ac- 
tive indicative  of  parerchomai,  to  pass  by.  Not  even  once 
(aorist)  in  contrast  with  so  many  years  of  service  (linear 
present).  A  kid  (eriphon).  Some  MSS.  have  eriphion, 
diminutive,  a  little  kid.  So  margin  of  Westcott  and  Hort. 
B  has  it  also  in  Matt.  25:32,  the  only  other  N.T.  passage 
where  the  word  occurs.  That  I  might  make  merry  (hina 
euphrantho).  Final  clause,  first  aorist  passive  subjunctive 
of  the  same  verb  used  in  verses  23,  25. 

30.  This  thy  son  {ho  huios  sou  houtos).  Contempt  and 
sarcasm.  He  does  not  say:  "This  my  brother."  Came 
(elthen).  He  does  not  even  say,  came  back  or  came  home. 
Devoured  (kataphagon) .  We  say,  "eaten  up,"  but  the  Greek 
has,  "eaten  down"  (perfective  use  of  kata-).  Suggested 
by  the  feasting  going  on.  With  harlots  (meta  pornon).  This 
may  be  true  (verse  13),  but  the  elder  son  did  not  know  it  to 
be  true.  He  may  reflect  what  he  would  have  done  in  like 
case. 

31.  Son  (Teknon).  Child.  Thou  (su).  Expressed  and  in 
emphatic  position  in  the  sentence.  He  had  not  appreciated 
his  privileges  at  home  with  his  father. 

32.  It  was  meet  (edei).  Imperfect  tense.  It  expressed  a 
necessity  in  the  father's  heart  and  in  the  joy  of  the  return 
that  justifies  the  feasting.  Euphranthenai  is  used  again 
(first  aorist  passive  infinitive)  and  charenai  (second  aorist 
passive  infinitive)  is  more  than  mere  hilarity,  deep-seated  joy. 
The  father  repeats  to  the  elder  son  the  language  of  his  heart 
used  in  verse  24  to  his  servants.  A  real  father  could  do  no 
less.  One  can  well  imagine  how  completely  the  Pharisees 
and  scribes  (verse  1)  were  put  to  silence  by  these  three  marvel- 
lous parables.  The  third  does  it  with  a  graphic  picture  of 
their  own  attitude  in  the  case  of  the  surly  elder  brother. 


214      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Luke  was  called  a  painter  by  the  ancients.  Certainly  he  has 
produced  a  graphic  pen  picture  here  of  God's  love  for  the 
lost  that  justifies  forever  the  coming  of  Christ  to  the  world  to 
seek  and  to  save  the  lost.  It  glorifies  also  soul-saving  on  the 
part  of  his  followers  who  are  willing  to  go  with  Jesus  after 
the  lost  in  city  and  country,  in  every  land  and  of  every  race. 


CHAPTER  XVI 

1.  Unto  the  disciples  {kai  pros  tous  mathetas).  The  three 
preceding  parables  in  chapter  15  exposed  the  special  faults 
of  the  Pharisees,  "their  hard  exclusiveness,  self-righteous- 
ness, and  contempt  for  others"  (Plummer).  This  parable 
is  given  by  Luke  alone.  The  "kai"  (also)  is  not  translated 
in  the  Revised  Version.  It  seems  to  mean  that  at  this  same 
time,  after  speaking  to  the  Pharisees  (chapter  15),  Jesus 
proceeds  to  speak  a  parable  to  the  disciples  (16:1-13),  the 
parable  of  the  Unjust  Steward.  It  is  a  hard  parable  to  ex- 
plain, but  Jesus  opens  the  door  by  the  key  in  verse  9.  Which 
had  a  steward  (hos  eichen  oikonomon).  Imperfect  active, 
continued  to  have.  Steward  is  house-manager  or  overseer 
of  an  estate  as  already  seen  in  Luke  12:42.  Was  accused 
(dieblethe).  First  aorist  indicative  passive,  of  diaballo,  an 
old  verb,  but  here  only  in  the  N.T.  It  means  to  throw  across 
or  back  and  forth,  rocks  or  words  and  so  to  slander  by  gos- 
sip. The  word  implies  malice  even  if  the  thing  said  is  true. 
The  word  diabolos  (slanderer)  is  this  same  root  and  it  is 
used  even  of  women,  she-devils  (I  Tim.  3:11).  That  he  was 
wasting  {hos  diaskorpizon).  For  the  verb  see  on  15:13.  The 
use  of  hos  with  the  participle  is  a  fine  Greek  idiom  for  giving 
the  alleged  ground  of  a  charge  against  one.  His  goods  (ta 
huparchonta  autou).    "His  belongings,"  a  Lukan  idiom. 

2.  What  is  this  that  I  hear?  (ti  touto  akouo;).  There  are 
several  ways  of  understanding  this  terse  Greek  idiom.  The 
Revised  Version  (above)  takes  ti  to  be  equal  to  ti  estin 
touto  ho  akouo;  That  is  a  possible  use  of  the  predicate 
touto.  Another  way  is  to  take  ti  to  be  exclamatory,  which 
is  less  likely.  Still  another  view  is  that  ti  is  "Why": 
"Why  do  I  hear  this  about  thee?"     See  Acts  14:15  where

that  is  the  idiom  employed.  Render  {apodos).  Second  aorist 
active  imperative  of  apodidomi,  Give  back  (and  at  once). 
The  account  {ton  logon).  The  reckoning  or  report.  Common 
use  of  logos.  Stewardship  {oikonomias) .  Same  root  as  oiko- 
nomos  (steward).  This  demand  does  not  necessarily  mean 
dismissal  if  investigation  proved  him  innocent  of  the  charges. 
But  the  reason  given  implies  that  he  is  to  be  dismissed: 
Thou  canst  no  longer  {ou  gar  dunei). 

3.  Within  himself  {en  heautoi).  As  soon  as  he  had  time 
to  think  the  thing  over  carefully.  He  knew  that  he  was 
guilty  of  embezzlement  of  the  Master's  funds.  Taketh 
away  {aphaireitai) .  Present  (linear)  middle  indicative  of 
aphaireo,  old  verb  to  take  away.  Here  the  middle  present 
means,  He  is  taking  away  for  himself.  To  beg  I  am  not 
ashamed  {epaitein  aischunomai).  The  infinitive  with  ais- 
chunomai  means  ashamed  to  begin  to  beg.  The  participle, 
epaitbn  aischunomai  would  mean,  ashamed  while  begging, 
ashamed  of  begging  while  doing  it. 

4.  /  am  resolved  {egnon).  Second  aorist  active  indicative 
of  ginosko.  A  difficult  tense  to  reproduce  in  English.  I 
knew,  I  know,  I  have  known,  all  miss  it  a  bit.  It  is  a  burst 
of  daylight  to  the  puzzled,  darkened  man:  I've  got  it,  I 
see  into  it  now,  a  sudden  solution.  What  to  do  {ti  poieso). 
Either  deliberative  first  aorist  active  subjunctive  or  delib- 
erative future  active  indicative.  When  I  am  put  out  {hotan 
metastatho).  First  aorist  passive  subjunctive  of  methistemi, 
{meta,  histemi),  old  verb,  to  transpose,  transfer,  remove.  He 
is  expecting  to  be  put  out.  They  may  receive  me  {dexontai). 
First  aorist  middle  subjunctive  of  dechomai,  common  verb. 
Subjunctive  with  final  particle  hina.  He  wishes  to  put  the 
debtors  under  obligation  to  himself.  Debtors  {ton  chreophile- 
ton).  A  late  word.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  7:41 
from  chreos,  loan,  and  opheiletes,  debtor.  It  is  probable  that 
he  dealt  with  "each  one"  separately. 

6.  Measures   {batous).     Transliterated  word  for  Heb-ew 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  217 

bath,  between  eight  and  nine  gallons.  Here  alone  in  the 
N.T.  Not  the  same  word  as  batos  (bush)  in  Luke  6:44. 
Thy  bond  (sou  ta  grammata).  Thy  writings,  thy  contracts, 
thy  note.  Quickly  (tachebs).  It  was  a  secret  arrangement 
and  speed  was  essential. 

7.  Measures  (korous).  Another  Hebrew  word  for  dry 
measure.  The  Hebrew  cor  was  about  ten  bushels.  Data 
are  not  clear  about  the  Hebrew  measures  whether  liquid 
(bath)  or  dry  (cor). 

8.  His  lord  commended  (epeinesen  ho  kurios).  The  stew- 
ard's lord  praised  him  though  he  himself  had  been  wronged 
again  (see  verse  1  "wasting  his  goods").  The  unrighteous 
steward  (ton  oikonomon  tes  adikias).  Literally,  the  steward 
of  unrighteousness.  The  genitive  is  the  case  of  genus, 
species,  the  steward  distinguished  by  unrighteousness  as 
his  characteristic.  See  "the  mammon  of  unrighteousness" 
in  verse  9.  See  "the  forgetful  hearer"  in  James  1:25.  It 
is  a  vernacular  idiom  common  to  Hebrew,  Aramaic,  and  the 
Koine.  Wisely  (phronimos).  An  old  adverb,  though  here 
alone  in  the  N.T.  But  the  adjective  phronimos  from  which 
it  comes  occurs  a  dozen  times  as  in  Matt.  10:16.  It  is  from 
phroneo  and  that  from  phren,  the  mind  (I  Cor.  14:20),  the 
discerning  intellect.  Perhaps  "shrewdly"  or  "discreetly" 
is  better  here  than  "wisely."  The  lord  does  not  absolve 
the  steward  from  guilt  and  he  was  apparently  dismissed 
from  his  service.  His  shrewdness  consisted  in  finding  a  place 
to  go  by  his  shrewdness.  He  remained  the  steward  of  un- 
righteousness even  though  his  shrewdness  was  commended. 
For  (hoti).  Probably  by  this  second  hoti  Jesus  means  to 
say  that  he  cites  this  example  of  shrewdness  because  it 
illustrates  the  point.  "This  is  the  moral  of  the  whole  para- 
ble. Men  of  the  world  in  their  dealings  with  men  like  them- 
selves are  more  prudent  than  the  children  of  light  in  their 
intercourse  with  one  another"  (Plummer).  We  all  know 
how  stupid  Christians  can  be  in  their  co-operative  work 


21 8      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

in  the  kingdom  of  God,  to  go  no  further.  Wiser  than 
{phronimbteroi  huper).  Shrewder  beyond,  a  common  Greek 
idiom. 

9.  By  the  mammon  of  unrighteousness  (ek  tou  mambna  ies 
adikias).  By  the  use  of  what  is  so  often  evil  (money). 
In  Matt.  6:24  mammon  is  set  over  against  God  as  in  Luke 
16:13  below.  Jesus  knows  the  evil  power  in  money,  but 
servants  of  God  have  to  use  it  for  the  kingdom  of  God. 
They  should  use  it  discreetly  and  it  is  proper  to  make  friends 
by  the  use  of  it.  When  it  shall  fail  (hotan  eklipei).  Second 
aorist  active  subjunctive  with  hotan,  future  time.  The 
mammon  is  sure  to  fail.  That  they  may  receive  you  into  the 
eternal  tabernacles  ihina  dexbntai  humas  eis  tas  aibnious 
skenas).  This  is  the  purpose  of  Christ  in  giving  the  advice 
about  their  making  friends  by  the  use  of  money.  The  pur- 
pose is  that  those  who  have  been  blessed  and  helped  by  the 
money  may  give  a  welcome  to  their  benefactors  when  they 
reach  heaven.  There  is  no  thought  here  of  purchasing  an 
entrance  into  heaven  by  the  use  of  money.  That  idea  is 
wholly  foreign  to  the  context.  These  friends  will  give  a 
hearty  welcome  when  one  gives  him  mammon  here.  The 
wise  way  to  lay  up  treasure  in  heaven  is  to  use  one's  money 
for  God  here  on  earth.  That  will  give  a  cash  account  there 
of  joyful  welcome,  not  of  purchased  entrance. 

10.  Faithful  in  a  very  little  {pistos  en  elachistbi).  Elative 
superlative.  One  of  the  profoundest  sayings  of  Christ.  We 
see  it  in  business  life.  The  man  who  can  be  trusted  in  a 
very  small  thing  will  be  promoted  to  large  responsibilities. 
That  is  the  way  men  climb  to  the  top.  Men  who  embezzle 
in  large  sums  began  with  small  sums.  Verses  10  to  13  here 
explain  the  point  of  the  preceding  parables. 

11.  Faithful  in  the  unrighteous  mammon  {en  tbi  adikoi 
mambnai).  In  the  use  of  what  is  considered  "unrighteous" 
as  it  so  often  is.  Condition  of  the  first  class,  "if  ye  did  not 
prove  to  be"  {ex  ouk  egenesthe).    Failure  here  forfeits  conn- 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  219 

dence  in  "the  true  riches"  (to  alethinon).  There  is  no  sad- 
der story  than  to  see  a  preacher  go  down  by  the  wrong  use 
of  money,  caught  in  this  snare  of  the  devil. 

12.  That  which  is  your  own  (to  humeteron).  But  Westcott 
and  Hort  read  to  hemeteron  (our  own)  because  of  B  L  Origen. 
The  difference  is  due  to  itacism  in  the  pronunciation  of 
hu  and  he  alike  (long  i).  But  the  point  in  the  passage  calls 
for  "yours"  as  correct.  Earthly  wealth  is  ours  as  a  loan, 
a  trust,  withdrawn  at  any  moment.  It  belongs  to  another 
(en  toi  allotrioi).  If  you  did  not  prove  faithful  in  this,  who 
will  give  you  what  is  really  yours  forever?  Compare  "rich 
toward  God"  (Luke  12:21). 

13.  Servant  (oiketes).  Household  (oikos)  servant.  This 
is  the  only  addition  to  Matt.  6:24  where  otherwise  the 
language  is  precisely  the  same,  which  see.  Either  Matthew 
or  Luke  has  put  the  logion  in  the  wrong  place  or  Jesus  spoke 
it  twice.  It  suits  perfectly  each  context.  There  is  no  real 
reason  for  objecting  to  repetition  of  favourite  sayings  by 
Jesus. 

14.  Who  were  lovers  of  money  (philarguroi  huparchontes) . 
Literally,  being  lovers  of  money.  Philarguroi  is  an  old  word, 
but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  II  Tim.  3  :2.  It  is  from  philos 
and  arguros.  Heard  (ekouon).  Imperfect  active,  were 
listening  (all  the  while  Jesus  was  talking  to  the  disciples 
(verses  1— 13).  And  they  scoffed  at  him  (kai  exemukterizon). 
Imperfect  active  again  of  ekmukterizo.  LXX  where  late 
writers  use  simple  verb.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke 
23 135.  It  means  to  turn  out  or  up  the  nose  at  one,  to  sneer, 
to  scoff.  The  Romans  had  a  phrase,  naso  adunco  suspender  e^ 
to  hang  on  the  hooked  nose  (the  subject  of  ridicule).  These 
money-loving  Pharisees  were  quick  to  see  that  the  words 
of  Jesus  about  the  wise  use  of  money  applied  to  them.  They 
had  stood  without  comment  the  three  parables  aimed  di- 
rectly at  them  (the  lost  sheep,  the  lost  coin,  the  lost  son). 
But  now  they  do  not  remain  quiet  while  they  hear  the  fourth 


220      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

parable  spoken  to  the  disciples.  No  words  were  apparently 
spoken,  but  their  eyes,  noses,  faces  were  eloquent  with  a 
fine  disdain. 

15.  That  justify  yourselves  {hoi  dikaiountes  heautous). 
They  were  past-masters  at  that  and  were  doing  it  now  by 
upturned  noses.  An  abomination  in  the  sight  of  God  (bdelugma 
enbpion  tou  theou).  See  on  Matt.  24:15  =Mark  13:14  for 
this  LXX  word  for  a  detestable  thing  as  when  Antiochus 
Epiphanes  set  up  an  altar  to  Zeus  in  place  of  that  to  Jeho- 
vah. There  is  withering  scorn  in  the  use  of  this  phrase  by 
Jesus  to  these  pious  pretenders. 

16.  Enter eth  violently  into  it  {eis  auien  biazetai).  A  cor- 
responding saying  occurs  in  Matt.  11:12  in  a  very  different 
context.  In  both  the  verb  biazetai,  occurs  also,  but  nowhere 
else  in  the  N.T.  It  is  present  middle  here  and  can  be  middle 
or  passive  in  Matthew,  which  see.  It  is  rare  in  late  prose. 
Deissmann  (Bible  Studies,  p.  258)  cites  an  inscription  where 
biazomai  is  reflexive  middle  and  used  absolutely.  Here  the 
meaning  clearly  is  that  everyone  forces  his  way  into  the 
kingdom  of  God,  a  plea  for  moral  enthusiasm  and  spiritual 
passion  and  energy  that  some  today  affect  to  despise. 

17.  One  tittle  (mian  kerean).    See  on  Matt.  5:18. 

18.  Committeth  adultery  (moicheuei).  Another  repeated 
saying  of  Christ  (Matt.  5:32;  Mark  io:iif.  =Matt.  19:91.). 
Adultery  remains  adultery,  divorce  or  no  divorce,  remarriage 
or  no  marriage. 

19.  He  was  clothed  (enedidusketo) .  Imperfect  middle  of 
endidusko,  a  late  intensive  form  of  enduo.  He  clothed  him- 
self in  or  with.  It  was  his  habit.  Purple  (porphuran).  This 
purple  dye  was  obtained  from  the  purple  fish,  a  species  of 
mussel  or  murex  (I  Mace.  4:23).  It  was  very  costly  and  was 
used  for  the  upper  garment  by  the  wealthy  and  princes 
(royal  purple).  They  had  three  shades  of  purple  (deep  violet, 
deep  scarlet  or  crimson,  deep  blue).  See  also  Mark  15:17,  20; 
Rev.  18:12.    Fine  linen  (busson).    Byssus  or  Egyptian  flax 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  221 

(India  and  Achaia  also).  It  is  a  yellowed  flax  from  which 
fine  linen  was  made  for  undergarments.  It  was  used  for 
wrapping  mummies.  "Some  of  the  Egyptian  linen  was  so 
fine  that  it  was  called  woven  air"  (Vincent).  Here  only  in 
the  N.T.  for  the  adjective  bussinos  occurs  in  Rev.  18:12; 
19:8,  14.  Faring  sumptuously  (euphrainomenos  lampros). 
Making  merry  brilliantly.  The  verb  euphrainomai  we  have 
already  had  in  12:19;  15:23,  25,  32.  Lampros  is  an  old  ad- 
verb from  lampros,  brilliant,  shining,  splendid,  magnificent. 
It  occurs  here  only  in  the  N.T.  This  parable  apparently 
was  meant  for  the  Pharisees  (verse  14)  who  were  lovers  of 
money.    It  shows  the  wrong  use  of  money  and  opportunity. 

20.  Beggar  (ptochos).  Original  meaning  of  this  old  word. 
See  on  Matt.  5:3.  The  name  Lazarus  is  from  Eleazaros, 
"God  a  help,"  and  was  a  common  one.  Lazar  in  English 
means  one  afflicted  with  a  pestilential  disease.  Was  laid 
(ebebleto).  Past  perfect  passive  of  the  common  verb  ballo. 
He  had  been  flung  there  and  was  still  there,  "as  if  contemp- 
tuous roughness  is  implied"  (Plummer).  At  his  gate  (pros 
ton  pulona  autou).  Right  in  front  of  the  large  portico  or 
gateway,  not  necessarily  a  part  of  the  grand  house,  porch 
in  Matt.  26:71.  Full  of  sores  (heilkomenos).  Perfect  passive 
participle  of  helkoo,  to  make  sore,  to  ulcerate,  from  helkos, 
ulcer  (Latin  ulcus).  See  use  of  helkos  in  verse  21.  Common 
in  Hippocrates  and  other  medical  writers.  Here  only  in  the 
N.T. 

21.  With  the  crumbs  that  fell  (apo  ton  piptonton).  From 
the  things  that  fell  from  time  to  time.  The  language  reminds 
one  of  Luke  15  :i6  (the  prodigal  son)  and  the  Syro-Phoenician 
woman  (Mark  7:28).  Only  it  does  not  follow  that  this  beggar 
did  not  get  the  scraps  from  the  rich  man's  table.  Probably 
he  did,  though  nothing  more.  Even  the  wild  street  dogs 
would  get  them  also.  Yea,  even  the  dogs  (alia  kai  hoi  kunes). 
For  alia  kai  see  also  12:7,  24:22.  Alia  can  mean  "yea," 
though  it  often  means  "but."    Here  it  depends  on  how  one 


222      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

ponstrues  Luke's  meaning.  If  he  means  that  he  was  depend- 
ent on  casual  scraps  and  it  was  so  bad  that  even  the  wild 
dogs  moreover  were  his  companions  in  misery,  the  climax 
came  that  he  was  able  to  drive  away  the  dogs.  The  other 
view  is  that  his  hunger  was  unsatisfied,  but  even  the  dogs 
increased  his  misery.  Licked  his  sores  (epeleichon  ta  helke 
autou).  Imperfect  active  of  epileicho,  a  late  vernacular 
Koini  verb,  to  lick  over  the  surface.  It  is  not  clear  whether 
the  licking  of  the  sores  by  the  dogs  added  to  the  misery  of 
Lazarus  or  gave  a  measure  of  comfort,  as  he  lay  in  his  help- 
less condition.  "Furrer  speaks  of  witnessing  dogs  and  lepers 
waiting  together  for  the  refuse"  (Bruce).  It  was  a  scramble 
between  the  dogs  and  Lazarus. 

22.  Was  borne  (apenechthenai).  First  aorist  passive  in- 
finitive from  apophero,  a  common  compound  defective  verb. 
The  accusative  case  of  general  reference  (auton)  is  common 
with  the  infinitive  in  such  clauses  after  egeneto,  like  indirect 
discourse.  It  is  his  soul,  of  course,  that  was  so  borne  by  the 
angels,  not  his  body.  Into  Abraham's  bosom  (eis  ton  holpon 
Abraam).  To  be  in  Abraham's  bosom  is  to  the  Jew  to  be  in 
Paradise.  In  John  1:18  the  Logos  is  in  the  bosom  of  the 
Father.  Abraham,  Isaac,  and  Jacob  are  in  heaven  and  wel- 
come those  who  come  (Matt.  8:ii;  IV  Mace.  14:17).  The 
beloved  disciple  reclined  on  the  bosom  of  Jesus  at  the  last 
passover  (John  13:23)  and  this  fact  indicates  special  favour. 
So  the  welcome  to  Lazarus  was  unusual.  Was  buried 
(etaphe).  Second  aorist  (effective)  passive  of  the  common 
verb  thapto.  Apparently  in  contrast  with  the  angelic  visita- 
tion to  the  beggar. 

23.  In  Hades  (en  toi  Hdidex).  See  on  Matt.  16:18  for  dis- 
cussion of  this  word.  Lazarus  was  in  Hades  also  for  both 
Paradise  (Abraham's  bosom)  and  Gehenna  are  in  the  unseen 
world  beyond  the  grave.  In  torments  (en  basanois).  The 
touchstone  by  which  gold  and  other  metals  were  tested,  then 
the  rack  for  torturing  people.    Old  word,  but  in  the  N.T. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  223 

only  here,  Luke  16:28,  and  Matt.  4:24.  Sees  {hordi).  Dra- 
matic present  indicative.  The  Jews  believed  that  Gehenna 
and  Paradise  were  close  together.  This  detail  in  the  parable 
does  not  demand  that  we  believe  it.  The  picture  calls  for  it. 
From  afar  (apo  makrothen) .  Pleonastic  use  of  apo  as  mak- 
rothen  means  from  afar. 

24.  That  he  may  dip  (hina  bapsei).  First  aorist  active  sub- 
junctive of  bapto,  common  verb,  to  dip.  In  water  {hudatos). 
Genitive,  the  specifying  case,  water  and  not  something  else. 
Cool  (katapsuxei).  First  aorist  active  subjunctive  of  kata- 
psucho,  a  late  Greek  compound,  to  cool  off,  to  make  cool. 
Only  here  in  the  N.T.  but  common  in  medical  books.  Note 
perfective  use  of  kata-  (down).  A  small  service  that  will  be 
welcome.  For  I  am  in  anguish  {hoti  odunbmai).  The  active 
has  a  causative  sense  to  cause  intense  pain,  the  middle  to 
torment  oneself  (Luke  2:48;  Acts  20:38),  the  passive  to  be 
translated  as  here.  Common  verb,  but  no  other  examples  in 
the  N.T. 

25.  Receivedst  (apelabes).  Second  aorist  indicative  of 
apolambano,  old  verb  to  get  back  what  is  promised  and  in 
full.  See  also  Luke  6:34;  18:30;  23  141.  Evil  things  [ta  kaka). 
Not  "his,"  but  "the  evil  things"  that  came  upon  him.  Thou 
art  in  anguish  (odundsai).  Like  kauchdsai  in  Rom.  2:17. 
They  contracted  -aesai  without  the  loss  of  s.  Common  in 
the  Koine. 

26.  Beside  all  this  {en  pdsi  toutois).  In  all  these  things  (or 
regions).  Gulf  (chasma).  An  old  word  from  chaino,  to  yawn, 
our  chasm,  a  gaping  opening.  Only  here  in  the  N.T.  Is 
fixed  (esteriktai) .  Perfect  passive  indicative  of  sterizo,  old 
verb  (see  on  Luke  9:51).  Permanent  chasm.  May  not  be 
able  {me  dunontai).  Present  middle  subjunctive  of  dunamai. 
The  chasm  is  there  on  purpose  {that  not,  hopbs  me)  to  prevent 
communication. 

27.  That  you  send  him  {hina  pempseis  auton).  As  if  he  had 
not  had  a  fair  warning  and  opportunity.    The  Roman  Cath- 


224      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

olics  probably  justify  prayer  to  saints  from  this  petition  from 
the  Rich  Man  to  Abraham,  but  both  are  in  Hades  (the  other 
world).  It  is  to  be  observed  besides,  that  Abraham  makes  no 
effort  to  communicate  with  the  five  brothers.  But  heavenly 
recognition  is  clearly  assumed.  Dante  has  a  famous  descrip- 
tion of  his  visit  to  the  damned  {Purg.  iii,  1 14). 

28.  That  he  may  testify  (hopds  diamarturetai) .  An  old  verb 
for  solemn  and  thorough  (dia-)  witness.  The  Rich  Man 
labours  under  the  delusion  that  his  five  brothers  will  believe 
the  testimony  of  Lazarus  as  a  man  from  the  dead. 

29.  Let  them  hear  them  (akousatosan  auton).  Even  the 
heathen  have  the  evidence  of  nature  to  show  the  existence 
of  God  as  Paul  argues  in  Romans  so  that  they  are  without 
excuse  (Rom.  i:2of.). 

30.  They  will  repent  (metanoesousin) .  The  Rich  Man  had 
failed  to  do  this  and  he  now  sees  that  it  is  the  one  thing  lack- 
ing. It  is  not  wealth,  not  poverty,  not  alms,  not  influence, 
but  repentance  that  is  needed.  He  had  thought  repentance 
was  for  others,  not  for  all. 

31.  Neither  will  they  be  persuaded  {ouav>  peisthesontai). 
First  future  passive  of  peitho.  Gressmann  calls  attention 
to  the  fact  that  Jesus  is  saying  this  in  the  conclusion  of  the 
parable.  It  is  a  sharp  discouragement  against  efforts  today 
to  communicate  with  the  dead.  "Saul  was  not  led  to 
repentance  when  he  saw  Samuel  at  Endor  nor  were  the 
Pharisees  when  they  saw  Lazarus  come  forth  from  the  tomb. 
The  Pharisees  tried  to  put  Lazarus  to  death  and  to  explain 
away  the  resurrection  of  Jesus"  (Plummer).  Alford  com- 
ments on  the  curious  fact  that  Lazarus  was  the  name  of  the 
one  who  did  rise  from  the  dead  but  whose  return  from  the 
dead  "was  the  immediate  exciting  cause  of  their  (Pharisees) 
crowning  act  of  unbelief." 


CHAPTER  XVII 

1.  It  is  impossible  {anendekton  estin).  See  ouk  endechetai 
in  13:33.  Alpha  privative  {an-)  and  endektos,  verbal  adjec- 
tive, from  endechomai.  The  word  occurs  only  in  late  Greek 
and  only  here  in  the  N.T.  The  meaning  is  inadmissible, 
unallowable.  But  that  occasions  of  stumbling  should  come  (tou 
ta  skandala  me  elthein).  This  genitive  articular  infinitive  is 
not  easy  to  explain.  In  Acts  10:25  there  is  another  example 
where  the  genitive  articular  infinitive  seems  to  be  used  as 
a  nominative  (Robertson,  Grammar ',  p.  1040).  The  loose 
Hebrew  infinitive  construction  may  have  a  bearing  here,  but 
one  may  recall  that  the  original  infinitives  were  either  loca- 
tives {-eni)  or  datives  (-ai).  Ta  skandala  is  simply  the  ac- 
cusative of  general  reference.  Literally,  the  not  coming  as  to 
occasions  of  stumbling.  For  skandalon  (a  trap)  see  on  Matt. 
5:29;  16:23.  ^  is  nere  only  m  Luke.  The  positive  form  of 
this  saying  appears  in  Matt.  18:7,  which  see. 

2.  It  were  well  j or  him  {lusitelei  autoi).  An  old  word,  but 
only  here  in  the  N.T.,  from  lusiteles  and  this  from  luo,  to  pay, 
and  ta  tele,  the  taxes.  So  it  pays  the  taxes,  it  returns  ex- 
penses, it  is  profitable.  Literally  here,  "It  is  profitable  for 
him"  (dative  case,  autoi).  Matthew  has  sumpherei  (it  is 
advantageous,  bears  together  for).  //  a  millstone  were 
hanged  {ei  lithos  mulikos  perikeitai).  Literally,  "if  a  mill- 
stone is  hanged."  Present  passive  indicative  from  perikei- 
mai  (to  lie  or  be  placed  around).  It  is  used  as  a  perfect 
passive  of  peritithemi.  So  it  is  a  first-class  condition,  de- 
termined as  fulfilled,  not  second-class  as  the  English  transla- 
tions imply.  Mulikos  is  simply  a  stone  {lithos),  belonging 
to  a  mill.  Here  only  in  the  text  of  Westcott  and  Hort,  not 
in  Mark  9:42  which  is  like  Matt.  18:6  mulos  onikos  where 

225 


226      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

the  upper  millstone  is  turned  by  an  ass,  which  see.  Were 
thrown  (erriptai).  Perfect  passive  indicative  from  rhipto,  old 
verb.  Literally,  is  thrown  or  has  been  thrown  or  cast  or 
hurled.  Mark  has  bebletai  and  Matthew  katapontisthei, 
which  see,  all  three  verbs  vivid  and  expressive.  Rather 
than  (e).  The  comparative  is  not  here  expressed  before  e 
as  one  would  expect.  It  is  implied  in  lusitelei.  See  the  same 
idiom  in  Luke  15:7. 

3.  //  thy  brother  sin  {ean  hamartei).  Second  aorist  (in- 
gressive)  subjunctive  in  condition  of  third  class. 

4.  Seven  times  in  a  day  (heptakis  tes  hemeras).  Seven 
times  within  the  day.  On  another  occasion  Peter's  ques- 
tion (Matt.  18:21)  brought  Christ's  answer  "seventy  times 
seven"  (verse  22),  which  see.  Seven  times  during  the  day 
would  be  hard  enough  for  the  same  offender. 

5.  Increase  (prosthes).  Second  aorist  active  imperative 
of  prostithemi,  to  add  to.  Bruce  thinks  that  this  sounds  much 
like  the  stereotyped  petition  in  church  prayers.  A  little 
reflection  will  show  that  they  should  answer  the  prayer  them- 
selves. 

6.  If  ye  have  (ei  echete).  Condition  of  the  first  class, 
assumed  to  be  true.  Ye  would  say  (elegete  an).  Imperfect 
active  with  an  and  so  a  conclusion  (apodosis)  of  the  second 
class,  determined  as  unfulfilled,  a  mixed  condition  therefore. 
Sycamine  tree  (sukaminoi).  At  the  present  time  both  the 
black  mulberry  (sycamine)  and  the  white  mulberry  (syca- 
more) exist  in  Palestine.  Luke  alone  in  the  N.T.  uses  either 
word,  the  sycamine  here,  the  sycamore  in  19:4.  The  dis- 
tinction is  not  observed  in  the  LXX,  but  it  is  observed  in 
the  late  Greek  medical  writers  for  both  trees  have  medicinal 
properties.  Hence  it  may  be  assumed  that  Luke,  as  a  physi- 
cian, makes  the  distinction.  Both  trees  differ  from  the  Eng- 
lish sycamore.  In  Matt.  17:20  we  have  "mountain"  in 
place  of  "sycamine  tree."  Be  thou  rooted  up  {ekrizotheti). 
First   aorist   passive  imperative  as  is  phuteutheti.     Would 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  227 

have  obeyed  (hupekousen  an).  First  aorist  active  indicative 
with  an,  apodosis  of  a  second-class  condition  (note  aorist 
tense  here,  imperfect  elegete). 

7.  Sit  down  to  meat  (anapese).  Recline  (for  the  meal). 
Literally,  fall  up  (or  back). 

8.  And  will  not  rather  say  {all9  ouk  erei).  But  will  not  say? 
Ouk  in  a  question  expects  the  affirmative  answer.  Gird 
thyself  (perizosamenos).  Direct  middle  first  aorist  participle 
of  perizonnumi,  to  gird  around.  Till  I  have  eaten  and  drunken 
(heos  phago  kai  pio).  More  exactly,  till  I  eat  and  drink. 
The  second  aorist  subjunctives  are  not  future  perfects  in 
any  sense,  simply  punctiliar  action,  effective  aorist.  Thou 
shalt  eat  and  drink  {phagesai  kai  piesai).  Future  middle  in- 
dicative second  person  singular,  the  uncontracted  forms 
-esai  as  often  in  the  Koine.  These  futures  are  from  the 
aorist  stems  ephagon  and  epion  without  sigma. 

9.  Does  he  thank?  {me  echei  charin;).  Me  expects  the 
negative  answer.  Echo  charin,  to  have  gratitude  toward 
one,  is  an  old  Greek  idiom  (I  Tim.  1  :i2;  II  Tim.  1 13;  Heb. 
12:28). 

10.  Unprofitable  (achreioi).  The  Syriac  Sinaitic  omits 
"unprofitable."  The  word  is  common  in  Greek  literature, 
but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Matt.  25:30  where  it  means 
"useless"  (a  privative  and  chreios  from  chraomai,  to  use). 
The  slave  who  only  does  what  he  is  commanded  by  his 
master  to  do  has  gained  no  merit  or  credit.  "In  point  of 
fact  it  is  not  commands,  but  demands  we  have  to  deal  with, 
arising  out  of  special  emergencies"  (Bruce).  The  slavish 
spirit  gains  no  promotion  in  business  life  or  in  the  kingdom 
of  God. 

11.  Through  the  midst  of  Samaria  and  Galilee  (dia  meson 
Samarias  kai  Galilaias).  This  is  the  only  instance  in  the 
N.T.  of  dia  with  the  accusative  in  the  local  sense  of 
"through."  Xenophon  and  Plato  use  dia  me  sou  (genitive). 
Jesus  was  going  from  Ephraim  (John  1 1 :54)  north  through 


228      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

the  midst  of  Samaria  and  Galilee  so  as  to  cross  over  the 
Jordan  near  Bethshean  and  join  the  Galilean  caravan  down 
through  Perea  to  Jerusalem.  The  Samaritans  did  not  ob- 
ject to  people  going  north  away  from  Jerusalem,  but  did 
not  like  to  see  them  going  south  towards  the  city  (Luke 
9:51-56). 

12.  Which  stood  afar  off  {hoi  anestesan  porrbthen).  The 
margin  of  Westcott  and  Hort  reads  simply  estesan.  The 
compound  read  by  B  means  "rose  up,"  but  they  stood  at  a 
distance  (Lev.  13:45^).  The  first  healing  of  a  leper  (5:12- 
16)  like  this  is  given  by  Luke  only. 

13.  Lifted  up  {eran).  First  aorist  active  of  the  liquid 
verb  airb. 

14.  As  they  went  {en  tbi  hupagein  autous).  Favourite  Lukan 
idiom  of  en  with  articular  infinitive  as  in  17:11  and  often. 

16.  And  he  was  a  Samaritan  {kai  autos  en  Samareites). 
This  touch  colours  the  whole  incident.  The  one  man  who 
felt  grateful  enough  to  come  back  and  thank  Jesus  for  the 
blessing  was  a  despised  Samaritan.  The  autos  has  point 
here. 

18.  Save  this  stranger  {ei  me  ho  allogenes).  The  old  word 
was  allophulos  (Acts  10:28),  but  allogenes  occurs  in  the  LXX, 
Josephus,  and  inscriptions.  Deissmann  {Light  from  the 
Ancient  East,  p.  80)  gives  the  inscription  from  the  limestone 
block  from  the  Temple  of  Israel  in  Jerusalem  which  uses 
this  very  word  which  may  have  been  read  by  Jesus:  Let 
no  foreigner  enter  within  the  screen  and  enclosure  surround- 
ing the  sanctuary  {Methena  allogene  eisporeuesthai  entos  tou 
peri  to  hieron  truphaktou  kai  peribolou). 

20.  With  observation  {meta  paratesebs).  Late  Greek  word 
from  paraiereb,  to  watch  closely.  Only  here  in  the  N.T. 
Medical  writers  use  it  of  watching  the  symptoms  of  disease. 
It  is  used  also  of  close  astronomical  observations.  But  close 
watching  of  external  phenomena  will  not  reveal  the  signs 
of  the  kingdom  of  God. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  229 

21.  Within  you  (entos  humon).  This  is  the  obvious,  and, 
as  I  think,  the  necessary  meaning  of  entos.  The  examples 
cited  of  the  use  of  entos  in  Xenophon  and  Plato  where  entos 
means  "among"  do  not  bear  that  out  when  investigated. 
Field  {Ot.  Norv.)  "contends  that  there  is  no  clear  instance 
of  entos  in  the  sense  of  among"  (Bruce),  and  rightly  so. 
What  Jesus  says  to  the  Pharisees  is  that  they,  as  others,  are 
to  look  for  the  kingdom  of  God  within  themselves,  not  in 
outward  displays  and  supernatural  manifestations.  It  is 
not  a  localized  display  "Here"  or  "There."  It  is  in  this 
sense  that  in  Luke  1 1 :20  Jesus  spoke  of  the  kingdom  of  God 
as  "come  upon  you"  (ephthasen  eph?  humas),  speaking  to 
Pharisees.  The  only  other  instance  of  entos  in  the  N.T. 
(Matt.  23 :26)  necessarily  means  "within"  ("the  inside  of  the 
cup").  There  is,  beside,  the  use  of  entos  meaning  "within" 
in  the  Oxyrhynchus  Papyrus  saying  of  Jesus  of  the  Third 
Century  (Deissmann,  Light  from  the  Ancient  East,  p.  426) 
which  is  interesting:  "The  kingdom  of  heaven  is  within 
you"  {entos  humon  as  here  in  Luke  17:21). 

23.  Go  not  away  nor  follow  after  them  {me  apelthete  mede 
dibxete).  Westcott  and  Hort  bracket  apelthete  mede.  Note 
aorist  subjunctive  with  me  in  prohibition,  ingressive  aorist. 
Do  not  rush  after  those  who  set  times  and  places  for  the 
second  advent.  The  Messiah  was  already  present  in  the 
first  advent  (verse  21)  though  the  Pharisees  did  not  know  it. 

24.  Lighteneth  {astraptousd).  An  old  and  common  verb, 
though  only  here  and  24:4  in  the  N.T.  The  second  coming 
will  be  sudden  and  universally  visible.  There  are  still  some 
poor  souls  who  are  waiting  in  Jerusalem  under  the  delusion 
that  Jesus  will  come  there  and  nowhere  else. 

25.  But  first  {proton  de).  The  second  coming  will  be  only 
after  the  Cross. 

27.  They  ate,  they  drank,  they  married,  they  were  given  in 
marriage  {esthion,  epinon,  egamoun,  egamizonto).  Imper- 
fects all  of  them  vividly  picturing  the  life  of  the  time  of 


230      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Noah.     But  the   other  tenses   are   aorists    (Noah   entered 
eiselthen,  the  flood  came  elthen,  destroyed  apolesen). 

28.  Note  the  same  sharp  contrast  between  the  imperfects 
here  {ate  esthion,  drank  epinon,  bought  egorazon,  sold  epoloun, 
planted  ephuteuon,  builded  oikodomoun)  and  the  aorists  in 
verse  29  {went  out  exelthen,  rained  ebrexen,  destroyed  apolesen). 

30.  Is  revealed  {apokaluptetai).  Prophetic  and  futuristic 
present  passive  indicative. 

31.  Let  him  not  go  down  {me  katabato).  Second  aorist 
active  imperative  of  katabaino  with  me  in  a  prohibition  in 
the  third  person  singular.  The  usual  idiom  here  would  be 
me  and  the  aorist  subjunctive.  See  Mark  13  :i  5f.  =  Matt. 
24:17^  when  these  words  occur  in  the  great  eschatological 
discussion  concerning  flight  before  the  destruction  of  Jeru- 
salem. Here  the  application  is  "absolute  indifference  to  all 
worldly  interests  as  the  attitude  of  readiness  for  the  Son  of 
Man"  (Plummer). 

32.  Remember  Lot's  wife  {mnemoneuete  tes  gunaikos  Lot). 
Here  only  in  the  N.T.  A  pertinent  illustration  to  warn 
against  looking  back  with  yearning  after  what  has  been 
left  behind  (Gen.  19:26). 

33.  Shall  preserve  it  {zoogonesei  auten).  Or  save  it  alive. 
Here  only  in  the  N.T.  except  I  Tim.  6:13  and  Acts  7:19. 
It  is  a  late  word  and  common  in  medical  writers,  to  bring 
forth  alive  {zoos,  geno)  and  here  to  keep  alive. 

34.  In  that  night  {tautei  tei  nukti).  More  vivid  still,  "on 
this  night,"  when  Christ  comes. 

35.  Shall  be  grinding  {esontai  alethousai).  Periphrastic 
future  active  indicative  of  aletho,  an  old  verb  only  in  the 
N.T.  here  and  Matt.  24:41.  Together  {epi  to  auto).  In  the 
same  place,  near  together  as  in  Acts  2:1. 

37.  The  eagles  {hoi  aetoi).  Or  the  vultures  attracted  by 
the  carcass.  This  proverb  is  quoted  also  in  Matt.  24:28. 
See  Job  39:27-30;  Heb.  1:8;  Hos.  8:1.  Double  compound 
{epi-sun-)  in  epi-sun-achthesontai  completes  the  picture. 


CHAPTER  XVIII 

1.  To  the  end  that  (pros  to  dein).  With  a  view  to  the  being 
necessary,  pros  and  the  articular  infinitive.  The  impersonal 
verb  dei  here  is  in  the  infinitive  and  has  another  infinitive 
loosely  connected  with  it  proseuchesthai,  to  pray.  Not  to 
faint  (me  enkakein).  Literally,  not  to  give  in  to  evil  (en, 
kakeo,  from  kakos,  bad  or  evil),  to  turn  coward,  lose  heart, 
behave  badly.  A  late  verb  used  several  times  in  the  N.T. 
(II  Cor.  4:1,  16,  etc.). 

2.  Regarded  not  (me  entrepomenos) .  Present  middle  parti- 
ciple of  entrepo,  old  verb,  to  turn  one  on  himself,  to  shame  one, 
to  reverence  one.  This  was  a  "hard-boiled"  judge  who 
knew  no  one  as  his  superior.    See  on  Matt.  21 137. 

3.  Came  oft  (ercheto).  Imperfect  tense  denotes  repetitions, 
no  adverb  for  "oft"  in  the  Greek.  Avenge  me  of  (ekdikeson 
me  apo).  A  late  verb  for  doing  justice,  protecting  one  from 
another  (note  both  ek  and  apo,  here).  Deissmann  (Light 
from  the  Ancient  East,  pp.  42off.)  quotes  a  stele  of  the  second 
century  b.c.  with  a  prayer  for  vengeance  for  a  Jewish 
girl  that  had  been  murdered  which  has  this  very  verb 
ekdikeo. 

4.  He  would  not  (ouk  ethelen).  Imperfect  tense  of  con- 
tinued refusal.  Though  (ei  kai).  Concerning  sentence,  not 
kai  ei  (even  if). 

5.  Yet  (ge).  Delicate  intensive  particle  of  deep  feeling  as 
here.  Because  this  widow  troubleth  me  (dia  to  parechein  moi 
kopon  ten  cheran  tauten).  Literally,  because  of  the  furnishing 
me  trouble  as  to  this  widow  (accusative  of  general  reference 
with  the  articular  infinitive).  Lest  she  wear  me  out  (hina  me 
hupopiazei  me).  Some  take  it  that  the  judge  is  actually 
afraid  that  the  widow  may  come  and  assault  him,  literally 

231 


232      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

beat  him  under  the  eye.    That  idea  would  be  best  expressed 
here  by  the  aorist  tense. 

6.  The  unrighteous  judge  {ho  krites  tes  adikias).  The  judge 
of  unrighteousness  (marked  by  unrighteousness),  as  in  16:8 
we  have  "the  steward  of  unrighteousness,"  the  same  idiom. 

7.  And  he  is  longsuffering  {makrothumex) .  This  present 
active  indicative  comes  in  awkwardly  after  the  aorist  sub- 
junctive poiesei  after  ou  me,  but  this  part  of  the  question  is 
positive.  Probably  kai  here  means  "and  yet"  .as  so  often 
(John  9:30;  16:32,  etc.).  God  delays  taking  vengeance  on 
behalf  of  his  people,  not  through  indifference,  but  through 
patient  forbearance. 

8.  Hozvbeit  {plen).  It  is  not  clear  whether  this  sentence  is 
also  a  question  or  a  positive  statement.  There  is  no  way  to 
decide.  Either  will  make  sense  though  not  quite  the  same 
sense.  The  use  of  dra  before  heuresei  seems  to  indicate  a 
question  expecting  a  negative  answer  as  in  Acts  8:30  and 
Rom.  14:19.  But  here  dra  comes  in  the  middle  of  the  sen- 
tence instead  of  near  the  beginning,  an  unusual  position  for 
either  inferential  ara  or  interrogative  dra.  On  the  whole  the 
interrogative  dra  is  probably  correct,  meaning  to  question 
if  the  Son  will  find  a  persistence  of  faith  like  that  of  the 
widow. 

9.  Set  all  others  at  naught  {exouthenountas  tous  loipous). 
A  late  verb  exoutheneo,  like  oudeneo,  from  outhen  (ouden),  to 
consider  or  treat  as  nothing.  In  LXX  and  chiefly  in  Luke 
and  Paul  in  the  N.T. 

10.  Stood  (statheis).  First  aorist  passive  participle  of 
histemi.  Struck  an  attitude  ostentatiously  where  he  could 
be  seen.  Standing  was  the  common  Jewish  posture  in  prayer 
(Matt.  6:5;  Mark  11:25).  Prayed  thus  {tauta  proseucheto). 
Imperfect  middle,  was  praying  these  things  (given  following). 
With  himself  {pros  heauton).  A  soliloquy  with  his  own  soul, 
a  complacent  recital  of  his  own  virtues  for  his  own  self-satis- 
faction, not  fellowship  with  God,  though  he  addresses  God. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  233 

/  thank  thee  (eucharisto  soi).  But  his  gratitude  to  God  is  for 
his  own  virtues,  not  for  God's  mercies  to  him.  One  of  the 
rabbis  offers  a  prayer  like  this  of  gratitude  that  he  was  in  a 
class  by  himself  because  he  was  a  Jew  and  not  a  Gentile,  be- 
cause he  was  a  Pharisee  and  not  of  the  am-haaretz  or  common 
people,  because  he  was  a  man  and  not  a  woman.  Extortioners 
(harpages).  An  old  word,  harpax  from  same  root  as  harpazo, 
to  plunder.  An  adjective  of  only  one  gender,  used  of  robbers 
and  plunderers,  grafters,  like  the  publicans  (Luke  3:13), 
whether  wolves  (Matt.  7:15)  or  men  (I  Cor.  5:19^).  The 
Pharisee  cites  the  crimes  of  which  he  is  not  guilty.  Or  even 
(e  kai).  As  the  climax  of  iniquity  (Bruce),  he  points  to 
"this  publican."  Zaccheus  will  admit  robbery  (Luke  19:8). 
God  {ho  theos) .  Nominative  form  with  the  article  as  common 
with  the  vocative  use  of  theos  (so  verse  13;  and  John  20:28). 

12.  Twice  in  the  week  (dis  ton  sabbatou).  One  fast  a  year 
was  required  by  the  law  (Lev.  16:29;  Num.  29:7).  The 
Pharisees  added  others,  twice  a  week  between  passover  and 
pentecost,  and  between  tabernacles  and  dedication  of  the 
temple.  /  get  (ktomai).  Present  middle  indicative,  not 
perfect  middle  kektemai  (I  possess).  He  gave  a  tithe  of  his 
income,  not  of  his  property. 

13.  Standing  afar  off  (makrothen  hestos).  Second  perfect 
active  participle  of  histemi,  intransitive  like  statheis  above. 
But  no  ostentation  as  with  the  Pharisee  in  verse  11.  At  a 
distance  from  the  Pharisee,  not  from  the  sanctuary.  Would 
not  lift  (ouk  ethelen  oude  epdrai).  Negatives  (double)  imper- 
fect of  thelb,  was  not  willing  even  to  lift  up,  refused  to  lift 
(epdrai,  first  aorist  active  infinitive  of  the  liquid  compound 
verb,  ep-airo).  Smote  (etupte).  Imperfect  active  of  tupto,  old 
verb,  kept  on  smiting  or  beating.  Worshippers  usually  lifted 
up  their  closed  eyes  to  God.  Be  merciful  (hilastheti) .  First 
aorist  passive  imperative  of  hilaskomai,  an  old  verb,  found 
also  in  LXX  and  inscriptions  (exhilaskomai,  Deissmann, 
Bible  Studies,  p.  224).    A  sinner  (tot  hamartblbi).   The  sinner, 


234      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

not  a  sinner.  It  is  curious  how  modern  scholars  ignore  this 
Greek  article.  The  main  point  in  the  contrast  lies  in  this 
article.  The  Pharisee  thought  of  others  as  sinners.  The 
publican  thinks  of  himself  alone  as  the  sinner,  not  of  others 
at  all. 

14.  This  man  (houtos).  This  despised  publican  referred  to 
contemptuously  in  verse  11  as  "this"  (houtos)  publican. 
Rather  than  the  other  (par'  ekeinon).  In  comparison  with 
(placed  beside)  that  one.  A  neat  Greek  idiom  after  the 
perfect  passive  participle  dedikaiomenos.  For  (hoti).  This 
moral  maxim  Christ  had  already  used  in  14:11.  Plummer 
pertinently  asks:  "Why  is  it  assumed  that  Jesus  did  not  re- 
peat his  sayings?" 

15.  They  brought  (prosepheron).  Imperfect  active,  they 
were  bringing.  So  Mark  10:13.  Their  babes  (ta  brephe). 
Old  word  for  infants.  Here  Mark  10:13  and  Matt.  19:13  have 
paidia  (little  children).  Note  "also"  (kai)  in  Luke,  not  in 
Mark  and  Matthew.  That  he  should  touch  them  (hina  autbn 
haptetai).  Present  middle  subjunctive  (linear  action,  re- 
peatedly touch  or  one  after  the  other),  where  Mark  10:13  nas 
aorist  middle  subjunctive  (hapsetai).  Rebuked  (epetimbn). 
Imperfect  indicative  active.  Either  inchoative  began  to 
rebuke,  or  continued,  kept  on  rebuking.  Matthew  and  Mark 
have  the  aorist  epetimesan. 

16.  Called  (prosekalesato).  Indirect  middle  aorist  indica- 
tive, called  the  children  with  their  parents  to  himself  and 
then  rebuked  the  disciples  for  their  rebuke  of  the  parents. 
The  language  of  Jesus  is  precisely  that  of  Mark  10:14  which 
see,  and  nearly  that  of  Matt.  19:14  which  see  also.  The  plea 
of  Jesus  that  children  be  allowed  to  come  to  him  is  one  that 
many  parents  need  to  heed.  It  is  a  tragedy  to  think  of  par- 
ents "forbidding"  their  children  or  of  preachers  doing  the 
same  or  of  both  being  stumbling-blocks  to  children. 

17.  As  a  little  child  (hbs  paidion).  Jesus  makes  the  child 
the  model  for  those  who  seek  entrance  into  the  kingdom  of 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  235 

God,  not  the  adult  the  model  for  the  child.  He  does  not  say 
that  the  child  is  already  in  the  kingdom  without  coming  to 
him.  Jesus  has  made  the  child's  world  by  understanding  the 
child  and  opening  the  door  for  him. 

18.  Ruler  (archon).  Not  in  Mark  10:17  or  Matt.  19:16. 
What  shall  I  do  to  inherit?  (Ti  poiesas  kleronomesb;).  "By 
doing  what  shall  I  inherit?"  Aorist  active  participle  and 
future  active  indicative.  Precisely  the  same  question  is  asked 
by  the  lawyer  in  Luke  10:25.  This  young  man  probably 
thought  that  by  some  one  act  he  could  obtain  eternal  life. 
He  was  ready  to  make  a  large  expenditure  for  it.  Good 
(agathon).  See  on  Mark  10:17  and  Matt.  19:16  for  discussion 
of  this  adjective  for  absolute  goodness.  Plummer  observes 
that  no  Jewish  rabbi  was  called  "good"  in  direct  address. 
The  question  of  Jesus  will  show  whether  it  was  merely  ful- 
some flattery  on  the  part  of  the  young  man  or  whether  he 
really  put  Jesus  on  a  par  with  God.  He  must  at  any  rate 
define  his  attitude  towards  Christ. 

22.  One  thing  thou  lackest  yet  (eti  hen  sot  leipei).  Literally, 
one  thing  still  fails  thee  or  is  wanting  to  thee.  An  old  verb 
with  the  dative  of  personal  interest.  Mark  10:21  has  here 
husterei  se,  which  see.  It  was  an  amazing  compliment  for 
one  who  was  aiming  at  perfection  (Matt.  19:21).  The  youth 
evidently  had  great  charm  and  was  sincere  in  his  claims. 
Distribute  (diados).  Second  aorist  active  imperative  of 
diadidomi  (give  to  various  ones,  dia-).  Here  Mark  and 
Matthew  simply  have  dos  (give).  The  rest  the  same  in  all 
three  Gospels. 

23.  Became  (egenethe).  First  aorist  passive  indicative  of 
ginomai.  Like  his  countenance  fell  (stugnasas),  in  Mark 
10:22.  Exeedingly  sorrowful  (perilupos).  Old  adjective 
(peri,  lupe)  with  perfective  use  of  peri.  Very  rich  (plousios 
sphodra).    Rich  exceedingly.    Today,  a  multimillionaire. 

24.  Shall  they  enter  (eisporeuontai) .  Present  middle  in- 
dicative, futuristic  present. 


236      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

25.  Through  a  needle's  eye  (dia  tremolos  belones).  Both 
words  a~e  old.  Trema  means  a  perforation  or  hole  or  eye 
and  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Matt.  19:24.  Belone  means 
originally  the  point  of  a  spear  and  then  a  surgeon's  needle. 
Here  only  in  the  N.T.  Mark  10:25  and  Matt.  19:24  have 
rhaphidos  for  needle.  This  is  probably  a  current  proverb 
for  the  impossible.  The  Talmud  twice  speaks  of  an  elephant 
passing  through  the  eye  of  a  needle  as  being  impossible. 

26.  Then  who  (kai  tis).  Literally,  and  who.  The  kai  calls 
attention  to  what  has  just  been  said.  Wealth  was  assumed 
to  be  mark  of  divine  favour,  not  a  hindrance  to  salvation. 

27.  The  impossible  with  men  possible  with  God  (ta  adunata 
para  anthropois  dunata  para  toi  theoi).  Paradoxical,  but 
true.  Take  your  stand  "beside"  (para)  God  and  the  im- 
possible becomes  possible.  Clearly  then  Jesus  meant  the 
humanly  impossible  by  the  parabolic  proverb  about  the 
camel  going  through  the  needle's  eye.  God  can  break  the 
grip  of  gold  on  a  man's  life,  but  even  Jesus  failed  with  this 
young  ruler. 

28.  Our  own  (ta  idia).  Our  own  things  (home,  business, 
etc.).  Right  here  is  where  so  many  fail.  Peter  speaks  here 
not  in  a  spirit  of  boastfulness,  but  rather  with  his  reactions 
from  their  consternation  at  what  has  happened  and  at  the 
words  of  Jesus  (Plummer). 

30.  Shall  not  receive  (ouchi  me  label).  Very  strong  double 
negative  with  aorist  active  subjunctive  of  lambano.  Mani- 
fold more  (pollaplasiona) .  Late  Greek  word,  here  alone  in  the 
N.T.  save  Matt.  19:29  where  Westcott  and  Hort  have  it 
though  many  MSS.  there  read  hekatonplasiona  (a  hundred- 
fold) as  in  Mark  10:30. 

31.  Took  unto  him  (paralabon).  Second  aorist  active  par- 
ticiple of  paralambano.  Taking  along  with  himself.  So 
Mark  10:32.  Matt.  20:17  adds  ka£  idian  (apart).  Jesus  is 
making  a  special  point  of  explaining  his  death  to  the  Twelve. 
We  go  up  (anabainomen).    Present  active  indicative,  we  are 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  237 

going  up.  Unto  the  Son  of  man  (toi  huioi  tou  anthropou). 
Dative  case  of  personal  interest.  The  position  is  amphib- 
olous and  the  construction  makes  sense  either  with  "shall  be 
accomplished"  (telesthesetai)  or  "that  are  written"  (ta 
gegrammena),  probably  the  former.  Compare  these  minute 
details  of  the  prophecy  here  (verses  32L)  with  the  words  in 
Mark  io:33f.  =  Matt.  2o:i8f.,  which  see. 

33.  The  third  day  {tei  hemerai  tei  tritei).  The  day  the 
third.  In  Matt.  20:19  it  is  "the  third  day"  while  in  Mark 
10:34  "after  three  days"  occurs  in  the  same  sense,  which  see. 

34.  And  they  perceived  not  (kai  ouk  eginoskon).  Imperfect 
active.  They  kept  on  not  perceiving.  Twice  already  Luke 
has  said  this  in  the  same  sentence.  They  understood  none 
of  these  things  (ouden  touton  sunekan).  First  aorist  active 
indicative,  a  summary  statement.  This  saying  was  hid  from 
them  (en  to  rhema  touto  kekrummenon  ap*  anion).  Past  per- 
fect passive  indicative  (periphrastic),  state  of  completion. 
It  was  a  puzzling  experience.  No  wonder  that  Luke  tries 
three  times  to  explain  the  continued  failure  of  the  apostles 
to  understand  Jesus.  The  words  of  Christ  about  his  death 
ran  counter  to  all  their  hopes  and  beliefs. 

35.  Unto  Jericho  (eis  Iereicho).  See  on  Matt.  20:29  = 
Mark  10:46,  for  discussion  of  the  two  Jerichos  in  Mark  and 
Matt,  (the  old  and  the  new  as  here).  Begging  (epaiton). 
Asking  for  something.  He  probably  was  by  the  wayside 
between  the  old  Jericho  and  the  new  Roman  Jericho.  Mark 
gives  his  name  Bartimaeus  (10*46).  Matt.  20:30  mentions 
two. 

36.  Inquired  (epunthaneto).  Imperfect  middle.  Repeat- 
edly inquired  as  he  heard  the  tramp  of  the  passing  crowd 
going  by  (diaporeuomenou) .  What  this  meant  (Ti  eie  touto). 
Literally,  What  it  was.  Without  an  the  optative  is  due  to 
indirect  discourse,  changed  from  estin.  With  an  (margin  of 
Westcott  and  Hort)  the  potential  optative  of  the  direct  dis- 
course is  simply  retained. 


238      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

37.  Passeth  by  (parerchetai).  Present  middle  indicative 
retained  in  indirect  discourse  as  paragei  is  in  Matt.  20:30. 
No  reason  for  differences  of  English  tenses  in  the  two  pas- 
sages (was  passing  by,  passeth  by). 

38.  He  cried  (eboesen).  Old  verb,  boab,  to  shout,  as  in  9:38. 
Son  of  David  (huie  Daueid).  Shows  that  he  recognizes  Jesus 
as  the  Messiah. 

39.  That  he  should  hold  his  peace  (hina  sigesei).  Ingressive 
aorist  subjunctive.  That  he  should  become  silent,  as  with 
hina  sibpesei  in  Mark  10:48.  The  more  a  greai  deal  (polloi 
mallon).    By  much  more  as  in  Mark  10:48. 

40.  Stood  (statheis).  First  aorist  passive  where  Mark 
10:49  and  Matt.  20:32  have  stas  (second  aorist  active)  trans- 
lated "stood  still."  One  is  as  "  still "  as  the  other.  The  first 
is  that  Jesus  "stopped."  Be  brought  (achthenai).  First 
aorist  infinitive  in  indirect  command. 

41.  What  wilt  thou  that  I  should  do  unto  thee?  {Ti  soi 
theleis  poiesb;).  Same  idiom  in  Mark  10:51  =  Matt.  20:32 
which  see,  the  use  of  thelb  without  hina  with  aorist  sub- 
junctive (or  future  indicative).  See  same  references  also  for 
hina  anablepsb  "that  I  may  see  again"  without  verb  before 
hina.    Three  uses  of  anablepb  here  (verses  41,  42,  43). 

43.  Followed  (ekolouthei).  Imperfect  active  as  in  Mark 
10:52.  Either  inchoative  he  began  to  follow,  or  descriptive, 
he  was  following. 


CHAPTER  XIX 

1.  Was  passing  through  (diercheto).  Imperfect  middle. 
Now  Jesus  was  inside  the  Roman  Jericho  with  the  procession. 

2.  Chief  publican  (architelones) .  The  word  occurs  no- 
where else  apparently  but  the  meaning  is  clear  from  the  other 
words  with  archi-  like  archiereus  (chief  priest)  archipoimen 
(chief  shepherd).  Jericho  was  an  important  trading  point 
for  balsam  and  other  things  and  so  Zacchaeus  was  the  head 
of  the  tax  collections  in  this  region,  a  sort  of  commissioner 
of  taxes  who  probably  had  other  publicans  serving  under 
him. 

3.  He  sought  (ezetei).  Imperfect  active.  He  was  seeking, 
conative  idea.  Jesus  who  he  was  (Iesoun  tis  estin).  Prolepsis, 
to  see  who  Jesus  was.  He  had  heard  so  much  about  him. 
He  wanted  to  see  which  one  of  the  crowd  was  Jesus.  For  the 
crowd  (apo  tou  ochlou).  He  was  short  and  the  crowd  was 
thick  and  close.  Stature  (tei  helikiai).  No  doubt  of  that 
meaning  here  and  possibly  so  in  2:52.  Elsewhere  "age" 
except  Luke  12:25;  Matt.  6:27  where  it  is  probably  "stature" 
also. 

4.  Ran  on  before  (prodramon  eis  to  emprosthen).  Second 
aorist  active  participle  of  protrecho  (defective  verb).  "Be- 
fore" occurs  twice  (pro-  and  eis  to  emprosthen).  Into  a  syca- 
more tree  (epi  sukomorean) .  From  sukon,  fig,  and  moron,  mul- 
berry. The  fig-mulberry  and  quite  a  different  tree  from  the 
sycamine  tree  in  17:6,  which  see.  It  bore  a  poor  fruit  which 
poor  people  ate  (Amos  7:14).  It  was  a  wide  open  tree  with 
low  branches  so  that  Zacchaeus  could  easily  climb  into  it. 
That  way  (ekeines).  Feminine  for  hodos  (way)  is  understood. 
Genitive  case  with  di  in  composition  (dierchesthai)  or  as  an 
adverbial  use. 

239 


240      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

5.  Make  haste  and  come  down  {speusas  katabethi).  Simul- 
taneous aorist  active  participle  {speusas)  with  the  second 
aorist  active  imperative.    "Come  down  in  a  hurry." 

6.  He  made  haste  and  came  down  {speusas  katebe).  Luke 
repeats  the  very  words  of  Jesus  with  the  same  idiom.  Re- 
ceived him  joyfully  {hupedexato  auton  chair  on) .  The  very  verb 
used  of  Martha's  welcome  to  Jesus  (10:38).  "Joyfully"  is 
the  present  active  participle,  "rejoicing"  {chairbn). 

7.  Murmured  {diegogguzonto).  Imperfect  middle  of  this 
compound  onomatopoetic  word  dia-gogguzo.  In  Luke  5 130 
we  have  the  simple  gogguzo,  a  late  word  like  the  cooing  doves 
or  the  hum  of  bees.  This  compound  with  dia-  is  still  rarer, 
but  more  expressive.  To  lodge  {katalusai).  Jesus  was  the 
hero  of  this  crowd  from  Galilee  on  their  way  to  the  passover. 
But  here  he  had  shocked  their  sensibilities  and  those  of  the 
people  of  Jericho  by  inviting  himself  to  be  the  guest  of  this 
chief  publican  and  notorious  sinner  who  had  robbed  nearly 
everybody  in  the  city  by  exorbitant  taxes. 

8.  Stood  {statheis).  Apparently  Jesus  and  Zacchaeus  had 
come  to  the  house  of  Zacchaeus  and  were  about  to  enter  when 
the  murmur  became  such  a  roar  that  Zacchaeus  turned 
round  and  faced  the  crowd.  //  /  have  wrongfully  exacted 
aught  of  any  man  {ei  tinos  ti  esukophantesa).  A  most  signifi- 
cant admission  and  confession.  It  is  a  condition  of  the  first 
class  {ei  and  the  aorist  active  indicative)  that  assumes  it  to 
be  true.  His  own  conscience  was  at  work.  He  may  have 
heard  audible  murmurs  from  the  crowd.  For  the  verb 
sukophantein,  see  discussion  on  3  114,  the  only  two  instances 
in  the  N.T.  He  had  extorted  money  wrongfully  as  they  all 
knew.  /  return  fourfold  {apodidomi  tetraploun).  I  offer  to  do 
it  here  and  now  on  this  spot.  This  was  the  Mosaic  law 
(Ex.  22:1;  Num.  5:6f.).  Restitution  is  good  proof  of  a 
change  of  heart.  D.  L.  Moody  used  to  preach  it  with  great 
power.  Without  this  the  offer  of  Zacchaeus  to  give  half  his 
goods  to  the  poor  would  be  less  effective.    "It  is  an  odd 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  241 

coincidence,  nothing  more,  that  the  fig-mulberry  (sycamore) 
should  occur  in  connexion  with  the  fig-shewer  (sycophant)." 

10.  The  lost  (to  apolblos).  The  neuter  as  a  collective  whole, 
second  perfect  active  participle  of  apollumi,  to  destroy.  See 
Luke  1 5  for  the  idea  of  the  lost. 

11.  He  added  and  spake  (prostheis  eipen).  Second  aorist 
active  participle  of  prostithemi  with  eipen.  It  is  a  Hebrew 
idiom  seen  also  in  Luke  20:if.  he  added  to  send  (prosetheto 
pempsai)  and  in  Acts  12:3  "he  added  to  seize"  (prosetheto 
sullabein).  This  undoubted  Hebraism  occurs  in  the  N.T. 
in  Luke  only,  probably  due  to  the  influence  of  the  LXX  on 
Luke  the  Greek  Christian.  To  appear  (anaphainesthai). 
Present  passive  infinitive  of  an  old  verb  to  be  made  manifest, 
to  be  shown  up.     In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  21:3. 

12.  To  take  to  himself  a  kingdom  (labein  heautoi  basileian). 
Second  aorist  active  infinitive  of  lambano  with  the  dative 
reflexive  heautoi  where  the  middle  voice  could  have  been 
used.  Apparently  this  parable  has  the  historical  basis  of 
Archelaus  who  actually  went  from  Jerusalem  to  Rome  on  this 
very  errand  to  get  a  kingdom  in  Palestine  and  to  come  back 
to  it.  This  happened  while  Jesus  was  a  boy  in  Nazareth  and 
it  was  a  matter  of  common  knowledge. 

13.  Trade  ye  herewith  till  I  come  (pragmateusasthe  en  hoi 
erchomai) .  First  aorist  middle  imperative  of  pragmateuomai, 
an  old  verb  from  pragma,  business.  Here  only  in  the  N.T. 
Westcott  and  Hort  in  their  text  read  pragmateusasthai,  first 
aorist  middle  infinitive  (-ai  and  -e  were  pronounced  alike). 
The  infinitive  makes  it  indirect  discourse,  the  imperative 
direct.  While  I  am  coming  is  what  en  hoi  erchomai  really 
means. 

14.  His  citizens  (hoi  politai  autou).  That  actually  hap- 
pened with  Archelaus. 

15.  When  he  was  come  back  again  (en  toi  epanelthein  auton). 
"On  the  coming  back  again  as  to  him."  Luke's  favourite 
idiom  of  the  articular  infinitive  after  en  and  with  the  accusa- 


242      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

tive  of  general  reference.  Had  given  (dedokei).  Past  perfect 
active  indicative  without  augment  of  didomi.  That  he  might 
know  (hina  gnoi).  Second  aorist  active  subjunctive  of  gino- 
sko.    The  optative  would  be  gnoie. 

16.  Hath  made  (prosergasato).  Only  here  in  the  N.T. 
Note  pros-  in  addition,  besides,  more. 

17.  Have  thou  authority  (isthi  exousian  echon).  Periphrastic 
present  active  imperative.    Keep  on  having  authority. 

19.  Be  thou  also  over  (kai  su  epano  ginou).  Present  middle 
imperative.  Keep  on  becoming  over.  There  is  no  real  reason 
for  identifying  this  parable  of  the  pounds  with  the  parable 
of  the  talents  in  Matt.  25.  The  versatility  of  Jesus  needs 
to  be  remembered  by  those  who  seek  to  flatten  out  every- 
thing. 

20.  /  kept  (eichon).  Imperfect  active  of  echo.  I  kept  on 
keeping.  Laid  up  (apokeimenen) .  Present  passive  participle 
agreeing  with  hen  (which),  used  often  as  perfect  passive  of 
tithemi  as  here,  laid  away  or  off"  (apo).  It  is  not  the  peri- 
phrastic construction,  but  two  separate  verbs,  each  with  its 
own  force.  In  a  napkin  {en  soudaridi).  A  Latin  word  su- 
darium  from  sudor  (sweat)  transliterated  into  Greek,  a 
sweatcloth  handkerchief  or  napkin.  Found  in  papyrus  mar- 
riage contracts  as  part  of  the  dowry  (second  and  third  cen- 
turies a.d.,  Deissmann,  Bible  Studies,  p.  223).  Used  also 
for  swathing  the  head  of  the  dead  (John  11 144 ;  20:7). 

21.  I  feared  (ephoboumen) .  Imperfect  middle,  I  continued 
to  fear.  Austere  {austeros).  Old  Greek  word  from  auo,  to  dry 
up.  Reproduced  in  Latin  austeros  and  English  austere.  It 
means  rough  to  the  taste,  stringent.  Here  only  in  the  N.T. 
Compare  skleros  (hard)  in  Matt.  25:24.  "Harsh  in  flavour, 
then  in  disposition"  (Bruce).  Thou  layedst  not  down  (ouk 
ethekas).    Probably  a  proverb  for  a  grasping  profiteer. 

22.  Thou  knewest  (eideis).  Second  past  perfect  of  horao, 
to  see,  used  as  imperfect  of  oida,  to  know.  Either  it  must  be 
taken  as  a  question  as  Westcott  andHort  do  or  be  understood 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  243 

as  sarcasm  as  the  Revised  Version  has  it.  The  words  of 
the  wicked  {poneros)  slave  are  turned  to  his  own  condem- 
nation. 

23.  Then  wherefore  {kai  dia  ti).  Note  this  inferential  use 
of  kai-  in  that  case.  Into  the  bank  {epi  trapezan).  Literally, 
upon  a  table.  This  old  word  trapeza,  from  tetrapeza  {tetra, 
four,  pons,  foot).  It  means  then  any  table  (Mark  7:28),  food 
on  the  table  (Acts  16:34),  feast  or  banquet  (Rom.  11:9), 
table  of  the  money-changers  (John  2:15;  Mark  11:15;  Matt. 
21  :i2),  or  bank  as  here.  Our  word  bank  is  from  Old  English 
bench.  With  interest  {sun  tokoi).  Not  usury,  but  proper  and 
legal  interest.  Old  word  from  tikto,  to  bring  forth.  In  the 
N.T.  only  here  and  Matt.  25:27.  Should  have  required  it 
{an  auto  epraxa).  Conclusion  of  second-class  condition  the 
condition  or  apodosis  being  implied  in  the  participle  "com- 
ing" {elthon),  and  the  previous  question.  On  this  technical 
use  of  prasso  {epraxa)  see  Luke  3:13. 

25.  And  they  said  unto  him  {kai  eipan  autoi).  Probably 
the  eager  audience  who  had  been  listening  to  this  wonderful 
parable  interrupted  Jesus  at  this  point  because  of  this  sudden 
turn  when  the  one  pound  is  given  to  the  man  who  has  ten 
pounds.  If  so,  it  shows  plainly  how  keenly  they  followed 
the  story  which  Jesus  was  giving  because  of  their  excitement 
about  the  kingdom  (Luke  19:11). 

26.  That  hath  not  {tou  me  echontos).  The  present  tense  of 
echo  here,  that  keeps  on  not  having,  probably  approaches 
the  idea  of  acquiring  or  getting,  the  one  who  keeps  on  not 
acquiring.    This  is  the  law  of  nature  and  of  grace. 

27.  Reign  {basileusai).  First  aorist  active  infinitive, 
ingressive  aorist,  come  to  rule.  Slay  {katasphaxate) .  First 
aorist  active  imperative  of  katasphazo,  to  slaughter,  an  old 
verb,  but  only  here  in  the  N.T. 

28.  Went  on  before  {eporeueto  emprosthen).  Imperfect 
middle.  Jesus  left  the  parable  to  do  its  work  and  slowly  went 
on  his  way  up  the  hill  to  Jerusalem. 


244      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

29.  Unto  Bethphage  and  Bethany  (eis  Bethphage  kai  Betha- 
nia).  Both  indeclinable  forms  of  the  Hebrew  or  Aramaic 
names.  In  Mark  11  :i  "Bethany"  is  inflected  regularly, 
which  see.  Of  Olives  (Elaion).  As  in  Mark  11:1  and  Matt. 
2i:i,  though  some  editors  take  it  to  be,  not  the  genitive 
plural  of  elaia  (olive  tree),  but  the  name  of  the  place  Olivet. 
In  the  Greek  it  is  just  a  matter  of  accent  (circumflex  or 
acute)  Olivet  is  correct  in  Acts  1:12.  See  on  Matt.  21  :iff. 
and  Mark  11  -.iff.  for  details. 

30.  Whereon  no  man  ever  yet  sat  (eph'  hon  oudeis  popote 
anthropon  ekathisen).  Plummer  holds  that  this  fact  indicated 
to  the  disciples  a  royal  progress  into  the  city  of  a  piece  with 
the  Virgin  Birth  of  Jesus  and  the  burial  in  a  new  tomb. 

32.  As  he  had  said  unto  them  (kathos  eipen  autois).  Luke 
alone  notes  this  item. 

33.  As  they  were  loosing  (luonton  auton).  Genitive  abso- 
lute. The  owners  thereof  {hoi  kurioi  autou).  The  same  word 
kurios  used  of  the  Lord  Jesus  in  verse  31  (and  34)  and  which 
these  "owners"  would  understand.  See  on  Matt.  21:3  = 
Mark  1 1 13  for  kurios  used  by  Jesus  about  himself  with  the 
expectation  that  these  disciples  would  recognize  him  by  that 
title  as  they  did.  The  word  in  common  use  for  the  Roman 
emperor  and  in  the  LXX  to  translate  the  Hebrew  Elohim 
(God). 

35.  Set  Jesus  thereon  (epebibasan  ton  lesoun).  First 
aorist  active.  Old  verb,  to  cause  to  mount,  causative  verb 
from  baino,  to  go.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  10:34; 
Acts  23:24. 

36.  They  spread  (hupestronnuon).  Imperfect  active  de- 
scribing the  continued  spreading  as  they  went  on.  Hupo- 
stronnuo  is  a  late  form  of  the  old  verb  hupostorennumi.  Here 
only  in  the  N.T. 

37.  At  the  descent  (pros  tei  katabasei).  Epexegetic  of 
"drawing  nigh."  They  were  going  by  the  southern  slope 
of  the  Mount  of  Olives.    As  they  turned  down  to  the  city, 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  245 

the  grand  view  stirred  the  crowd  to  rapturous  enthusiasm. 
This  was  the  first  sight  of  the  city  on  this  route  which  is  soon 
obscured  in  the  descent.  The  second  view  bursts  out  again 
(verse  41).  It  was  a  shout  of  triumph  from  the  multitude 
with  their  long  pent-up  enthusiasm  (verse  n),  restrained  no 
longer  by  the  parable  of  the  pounds.  For  all  the  mighty  works 
which  they  had  seen  {peri  pason  eidon  dunamebn).  Neat 
Greek  idiom,  incorporation  of  the  antecedent  {dunameon) 
into  the  relative  clause  and  attraction  of  the  case  of  the  rela- 
tive from  the  accusative  has  to  the  genitive  hbn.  And  note 
"all."  The  climax  had  come,  Lazarus,  Bartimaeus,  and  the 
rest. 

38.  The  king  cometh  {ho  erchomenos,  ho  basileus).  The 
Messianic  hopes  of  the  people  were  now  all  ablaze  with  ex- 
pectation of  immediate  realization.  A  year  ago  in  Galilee 
he  had  frustrated  their  plans  for  a  revolutionary  movement 
"to  take  him  by  force  to  make  him  king"  (John  6:15). 
The  phrase  "the  coming  king"  like  "the  coming  prophet" 
(John  6:14;  Deut.  18:15)  expressed  the  hope  of  the  long- 
looked-for  Messiah.  They  are  singing  from  the  Hallel  in 
their  joy  that  Jesus  at  last  is  making  public  proclamation 
of  his  Messiahship.  Peace  in  heaven,  and  glory  in  the  highest 
{en  ouranoi  eirene  kai  doxa  en  hupsistois).  This  language 
reminds  one  strongly  of  the  song  of  the  angels  at  the  birth 
of  Jesus  (Luke  2:14).  Mark  11:10  and  Matt.  21:9  have 
"Hosannah  in  the  highest." 

39.  Some  of  the  Pharisees  {tines  ton  Pharisaion).  Luke 
seems  to  imply  by  "from  the  multitude"  {apo  tou  ochlou) 
that  these  Pharisees  were  in  the  procession,  perhaps  half- 
hearted followers  of  the  mob.  But  John  12:19  speaks  of 
Pharisees  who  stood  off  from  the  procession  and  blamed 
each  other  for  their  failure  and  the  triumph  of  Jesus.  These 
may  represent  the  bolder  spirits  of  their  same  group  who 
dared  to  demand  of  Jesus  that  he  rebuke  his  disciples. 

40.  //  these  shall  hold  their  peace  {ean  houtoi  siopesousin). 


246      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

A  condition  of  the  first  class,  determined  as  fulfilled.  The 
use  of  ean  rather  than  ei  cuts  no  figure  in  the  case  (see  Acts 
8:31;  I  Thess.  3:8;  I  John  5:15).  The  kind  of  condition  is 
determined  by  the  mode  which  is  here  indicative.  The  fu- 
ture tense  by  its  very  nature  does  approximate  the  aorist 
subjunctive,  but  after  all  it  is  the  indicative.  The  stones  will 
cry  out  {hoi  lithoi  kraxousin).  A  proverb  for  the  impossible 
happening. 

41.  Wept  {eklausen).  Ingressive  aorist  active  indicative, 
burst  into  tears.    Probably  audible  weeping. 

42.  //  thou  hadst  known  {ei  egnbs).  Second  aorist  active 
indicative  of  ginosko.  Second-class  condition,  determined 
as  unfulfilled.  Even  thou  {kai  su).  Emphatic  position  of 
the  subject.  But  now  {nun  de).  Aposiopesis.  The  conclu- 
sion is  not  expressed  and  the  sudden  breaking  off  and 
change  of  structure  is  most  impressive.  They  are  hid  {ek- 
rube).  Second  aorist  passive  indicative  of  krupto,  common 
verb,  to  hide. 

43.  Shall  cast  up  a  bank  {parembalousin  charaka).  Fu- 
ture active  indicative  of  paremballb,  a  double  compound 
{para,  en,  ballo)  of  long  usage,  finally  in  a  military  sense  of 
line  of  battle  or  in  camp.  Here  alone  in  the  N.T.  So  also 
the  word  charaka  {charax)  for  bank,  stake,  palisade,  rampart, 
is  here  alone  in  the  N.T.,  though  common  enough  in  the  old 
Greek.  Compass  thee  round  {perikuklosousin  se).  Future 
active  indicative.  Another  common  compound  to  make  a 
circle  {kuklos)  around  {peri),  though  here  only  in  the  N.T. 
Keep  thee  in  {sunexousin  se).  Shall  hold  thee  together  on 
every  side  {pantothen).    See  about  sunecho  on  4:38. 

44.  Shall  dash  to  the  ground  {edaphiousin).  Attic  future 
of  edaphizo,  to  beat  level,  to  raze  to  the  ground,  a  rare  verb 
from  edaphos,  bottom,  base,  ground  (Acts  22:7),  here  alone 
in  the  N.T.  Because  {antK  hon).  "In  return  for  which 
things."  Thou  knewest  not  {ouk  egnbs).  Applying  the  very 
words  of  the  lament  in  the  condition  in  verse  42.     This 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  247 

vivid  prophecy  of  the  destruction  of  Jerusalem  is  used  by 
those  who  deny  predictive  prophecy  even  for  Jesus  as  proof 
that  Luke  wrote  the  Gospel  after  the  destruction  of  Jeru- 
salem. But  it  is  no  proof  at  all  to  those  who  concede  to 
Jesus  adequate  knowledge  of  his  mission  and  claims. 

45.  Began  to  cast  out  (erxato  ekballein).  So  Mark  11:15 
whereas  Matt.  21:12  has  simply  "he  cast  out."  See  Mark 
and  Matthew  for  discussion  of  this  second  cleansing  of  the 
temple  at  the  close  of  the  public  ministry  in  relation  to  the 
one  at  the  beginning  in  John  2:14-22.  There  is  nothing 
gained  by  accusing  John  or  the  Synoptics  of  a  gross  chrono- 
logical blunder.  There  was  abundant  time  in  these  three 
years  for  all  the  abuses  to  be  revived. 

47.  He  was  teaching  (en  didaskon).  Periphrastic  imperfect. 
Daily  (to  kath>  hemeran).  Note  the  accusative  neuter  arti- 
cle, "as  to  the  according  to  the  day,"  very  awkward  Eng- 
lish surely,  but  perfectly  good  Greek.  The  same  idiom 
occurs  in  11:3.  Sought  (ezetoun).  Imperfect  active,  cona- 
tive  imperfect,  were  seeking,  trying  to  seek.  The  principal 
men  of  the  people  (hoi  protoi  tou  laou).  The  first  men  of  the 
people.  The  position  after  the  verb  and  apart  from  the 
chief  priests  and  the  scribes  calls  special  attention  to  them. 
Some  of  these  "first  men"  were  chief  priests  or  scribes,  but 
not  all  of  them.  The  lights  and  leaders  of  Jerusalem  were 
bent  on  the  destruction  (apolesai)  of  Jesus.  The  raising  of 
Lazarus  from  the  dead  brought  them  together  for  this 
action  (John  11:47-53;  12:9-11). 

48.  They  could  not  find  (ouch  heuriskon).  Imperfect  ac- 
tive. They  kept  on  not  finding.  What  they  might  do  (to 
ti  poiesosm).  First  aorist  active  deliberative  subjunctive 
in  a  direct  question  retained  in  the  indirect.  Note  the  arti- 
cle to  (neuter  accusative)  with  the  question.  Hung  upon 
him  (exekremeto  autou).  Imperfect  middle  of  ekkremamai, 
an  old  verb  (mi  form)  to  hang  from,  here  only  in  the  N.T. 
The  form  is  an  omega  form  from  ekkremomai,  a  constant 


248      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

tendency  to  the  omega  form  in  the  Koine.  It  pictures  the 
whole  nation  (save  the  leaders  in  verse  47)  hanging  upon 
the  words  of  Jesus  as  if  in  suspense  in  mid-air,  rapt  atten- 
tion that  angered  these  same  leaders.  Tyndal  renders  it 
"stuck  by  him." 


CHAPTER  XX 

1.  On  one  of  the  days  {en  miai  ton  hemerbn).  Luke's  favour- 
ite way  of  indicating  time.  It  was  the  last  day  of  the  temple 
teaching  (Tuesday).  Luke  20:1-19  is  to  be  compared  with 
Mark  27-12:12  and  Matt.  21:23-46.  There  came  upon  him 
{epestesan).  Second  aorist  active  indicative,  ingressive 
aorist  of  ephistemi,  old  and  common  verb,  stood  up  against 
him,  with  the  notion  of  sudden  appearance.  These  leaders 
(cf.  19:47)  had  determined  to  attack  Jesus  on  this  morning, 
both  Sadducees  (chief  priests)  and  Pharisees  (scribes),  a 
formal  delegation  from  the  Sanhedrin. 

2.  Tell  us  {eipon  hemin).  Luke  adds  these  words  to  what 
Mark  and  Matthew  have.  Second  aorist  active  imperative 
for  the  old  form  eipe  and  with  ending  -on  of  the  first  aorist 
active.  Westcott  and  Hort  punctuate  the  rest  of  the  sen- 
tence as  an  indirect  question  after  eipon,  but  the  Revised 
Version  puts  a  semicolon  after  "us"  and  retains  the  direct 
question.    The  Greek  manuscripts  have  no  punctuation. 

3.  Question  {logon).  Literally,  word.  So  in  Mark  1 1 129  = 
Matt.  21 :24. 

5.  They  reasoned  with  themselves  {sunelogisanto).  First 
aorist  middle  of  sullogizomai,  to  bring  together  accounts, 
an  old  word,  only  here  in  the  N.T.  Mark  and  Matthew  have 
dielogizonto  (imperfect  middle  of  dialogizomai,  a  kindred 
verb,  to  reckon  between  one  another,  confer).  This  form 
{dielogizonto)  in  verse  14  below.  7/  we  shall  say  {ean  eipo- 
men).  Third-class  condition  with  second  aorist  active  sub- 
junctive.   Suppose  we  say!    So  in  verse  6. 

6.  Will  stone  us  {katalithasei).  Late  verb  and  here  only 
in  the  N.T.  Literally,  will  throw  stones  down  on  us,  stone 
us  down,  overwhelm  us  with  stones.     They  be  persuaded 

249 


250      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

(pepeismenos  estin).  Periphrastic  perfect  passive  indicative 
of  peitho,  to  persuade,  a  settled  state  of  persuasion,  "is  per- 
suaded" (no  reason  for  use  of  "be"  here).  That  John  was  a 
prophet  (Ibanen  propheten  einai).  Accusative  and  infinitive 
in  indirect  assertion. 

7.  That  they  knew  not  (me  eidenai).  Accusative  and  in- 
finitive in  indirect  assertion  again  with  the  negative  me 
rather  than  ou. 

9.  Vineyard  (ampelbnd) .  Late  word  from  ampelos  (vine), 
place  of  vines.  So  in  Mark  12:1  =  Matt.  21:33.  Let  it 
out  (exedeto).  Second  aorist  middle  of  ekdidomi,  but  with 
variable  vowel  e  in  place  of  0  of  the  stem  do  (exedoto).  Same 
form  in  Mark  and  Matthew.  For  a  long  time  (chronous 
hikanous).  Accusative  of  extent  of  time,  considerable 
times  or  periods  of  time.  Not  in  Mark  and  Matthew,  though 
all  three  have  apedemesen  (went  off  from  home).  See  on 
Luke  7:6  for  hikanos. 

10.  At  the  season  (kairoi).  The  definite  season  for  the 
Fruit  like  ho  kairos  ton  karpon  (Matt.  21:34).  That  they 
should  give  (hina  dbsousin).  Future  indicative  with  hina 
for  purpose  like  the  aorist  subjunctive,  though  not  so  fre- 
quent. 

1.1.  He  sent  yet  another  (prosetheto  heteron  pempsai).  Lit- 
erally, he  added  to  send  another.  A  clear  Hebraism  repeated 
in  verse  12  and  also  in  19:11. 

12.  They  wounded  {traumatis antes).  First  aorist  active 
participle  of  traumatizo.  An  old  verb,  from  trauma,  a  wound, 
but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  19:16. 

13.  What  shall  I  dot  (Ti  poieso;).  Deliberative  future 
indicative  or  aorist  subjunctive  (same  form).  This  detail 
only  in  Luke.  Note  the  variations  in  all  three  Gospels. 
All  three  have  "will  reverence"  (entrapesontai)  for  which 
see  Matthew  and  Mark.  It  may  be  (isos).  Perhaps,  from 
isos,  equal.    Old  adverb,  but  only  here  in  the  N.T. 

14.  That  the  inheritance  may  be  ours  (hina  hembn  genetai 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  251 

he  kleronomia) .  That  the  inheritance  may  become  (genetai, 
second  aorist  middle  subjunctive  of  ginomai).  Here  Matt. 
21:39  has  schbmen  "let  us  get,  ingressive  aorist  active  sub- 
junctive." Cf.  echbmen,  present  subjunctive  of  the  same 
verb  echo  in  Rom.  5:1;  Mark  12:7  has  "and  it  will  be  ours" 
(estai) . 

16.  God  forbid  (me  genoito).  Optative  of  wish  about  the 
future  with  me.  Literally,  may  it  not  happen.  No  word 
"God"  in  the  Greek.  This  was  the  pious  protest  of  the  de- 
feated members  of  the  Sanhedrin  who  began  to  see  the  turn 
of  the  parable  against  themselves. 

17.  He  looked  upon  them  (emblepsas  autois).  Not  in  Mark 
and  Matthew.  First  aorist  active  participle  of  emblepb,  to 
look  on.  It  was  a  piercing  glance.  The  scripture  quoted 
is  from  Psa.  118:22  and  is  in  Mark  11:10  =  Matt.  21:42, 
which  see  for  the  inverted  attraction  of  the  case  lithon 
(stone)  to  that  of  the  relative  hon  (which). 

18.  Shall  be  broken  to  pieces  (sunthlasthesetai).  Future 
passive  indicative  of  sunthlab,  a  rather  late  compound, 
only  here  in  the  N.T.  unless  verse  44  in  Matt.  21  is  genuine. 
It  means  to  shatter.  Will  scatter  him  as  dust  (likmesei). 
From  likmab,  an  old  verb  to  winnow  and  then  to  grind  to 
powder.  Only  here  in  the  N.T.  unless  verse  44  in  Matt.  21 
is  genuine,  which  see. 

19.  To  lay  hands  on  him  (epibalein  epf  auton  tas  cheiras). 
Second  aorist  active  infinitive  of  epiballb,  an  old  verb  and 
either  transitively  as  here  or  intransitively  as  in  Mark  4:37. 
Vivid  picture  here  where  Mark  12:12  =  Matt.  21:46  has 
"to  seize"  (kratesai).  In  that  very  hour  (en  auiei  iei  horai). 
Luke's  favourite  idiom,  in  the  hour  itself.  Not  in  Mark  or 
Matthew  and  shows  that  the  Sanhedrin  were  angry  enough 
to  force  the  climax  then.  And  they  feared  (kai  ephobethesan). 
Adversative  use  of  kai  =  but  they  feared.  Hence  they  re- 
frained. For  they  perceived  (egnbsan  gar).  The  reason  for 
their    rage.      Second    aorist   active   indicative   of    ginbskb. 


252      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

J  gainst  them  {pros  autous).    As  in  Mark  12:12.     The  cap 
fitted  them  and  they  saw  it. 

20.  They  watched  him  (paraieres antes).  First  aorist  active 
participle  of  paratereo,  a  common  Greek  verb  to  watch  on  the 
side  or  insidiously  or  with  evil  intent  as  in  Luke  6:7  (pare- 
terounto)  of  the  scribes  and  Pharisees.  See  on  Mark  3:2. 
There  is  no  "him"  in  the  Greek.  They  were  watching  their 
chance.  Spies  (enkathetous).  An  old  verbal  adjective  from 
enkathiemi,  to  send  down  in  or  secretly.  It  means  Hers  in 
wait  who  are  suborned  to  spy  out,  one  who  is  hired  to  trap 
one  by  crafty  words.  Only  here  in  the  N.T.  Feigned  them- 
selves (hupokrinomenous  heautous).  Hypocritically  professing 
to  be  "righteous"  (dikaious).  "They  posed  as  scrupulous 
persons  with  a  difficulty  of  conscience"  (Plummer).  That 
they  might  take  hold  of  his  speech  (hina  epilabontai  autou  logon). 
Second  aorist  middle  of  epilambano,  an  old  verb  for  seizing 
hold  with  the  hands  and  uses  as  here  the  genitive  case.  These 
spies  are  for  the  purpose  of  (hina)  catching  hold  of  the  talk 
of  Jesus  if  they  can  get  a  grip  anywhere.  This  is  their  direct 
purpose  and  the  ultimate  purpose  or  result  is  also  stated,  "so 
as  to  deliver  him  up  "  (hbste  paradounai  auton) .  Second  aorist 
active  infinitive  of  paradidomi,  to  hand  over,  to  give  from 
one's  side  to  another.  The  trap  is  all  set  now  and  ready  to  be 
sprung  by  these  "spies."  Of  the  governor  (ton  hegemonos). 
The  Sanhedrin  knew  that  Pilate  would  have  to  condemn 
Jesus  if  he  were  put  to  death.  So  then  all  their  plans  focus 
on  this  point  as  the  goal.  Luke  alone  mentions  this  item 
here. 

21.  Rightly  (orthos).  Matthew  (22:16)  notes  that  these 
"spies"  were  "disciples"  (students)  of  the  Pharisees  and 
Mark  (12:13)  adds  that  the  Herodians  are  also  involved  in 
the  plot.  These  bright  theologues  are  full  of  palaver  and 
flattery  and  openly  endorse  the  teaching  of  Jesus  as  part  of 
their  scheme.  Acceptest  not  the  person  of  any  (ou  lambaneis 
prosopon).    Dost  not  take  the  face  (or  personal  appearance) 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  253 

as  the  test.  It  is  a  Hebraism  from  which  the  word  prosopo- 
lempsia  (James  2:1)  comes.  Originally  it  meant  to  lift  the  face, 
to  lift  the  countenance,  to  regard  the  face,  to  accept  the  face 
value.  See  Mark  12:13-17  and  Matt.  22:15-22  for  discussion 
of  details  here.    They  both  have  blepeis  here. 

22.  Tribute  (phoron).  Old  word  for  the  annual  tax  on  land, 
houses,  etc.  Mark  and  Matthew  have  kenson,  which  see  for 
this  Latin  word  in  Greek  letters.  The  picture  on  the  coin  may 
have  been  that  of  Tiberius. 

23 .  Perceived  (katanoesas) .  From  katanoeo,  to  put  the  mind 
down  on.  Mark  has  eidos,  "knowing,"  and  Matthew  gnous, 
coming  to  know  or  grasping  (second  aorist  active  participle 
of  ginbsko).  Craftiness  {panourgian).  Old  word  for  doing 
any  deed.  Matthew  has  "wickedness"  (ponerian)  and  Mark 
"hypocrisy"  (hupokrisin).  Unscrupulous  they  certainly 
were.    They  would  stoop  to  any  trick  and  go  the  limit. 

26.  They  were  not  able  {puk  ischusan).  They  did  not  have 
strength.  An  old  verb  ischuo  from  ischus  (strength).  They 
failed  "to  take  hold  (cf.  verse  20)  of  the  saying  before  the 
people."  These  "crack"  students  had  made  an  ignominious 
failure  and  were  not  able  to  make  a  case  for  the  surrender  of 
Jesus  to  Pilate.  He  had  slipped  through  their  net  with  the 
utmost  ease.  Held  their  peace  (esigesan).  Ingressive  aorist 
active  of  sigao.  They  became  silent  as  they  went  back  with 
the  "dry  grins." 

27.  There  is  no  resurrection  [anastasin  me  einai).  Accusa- 
tive and  infinitive  with  negative  me  in  indirect  assertion. 
The  Sadducees  rally  after  the  complete  discomfiture  of  the 
Pharisees  and  Herodians.  They  had  a  stock  conundrum  with 
which  they  had  often  gotten  a  laugh  on  the  Pharisees.  So 
they  volunteer  to  try  it  on  Jesus.  For  discussion  of  details 
here  see  on  Matt.  22:23-33  and  Mark  12:18-27.  Only  a  few 
striking  items  remain  for  Luke. 

33.  Had  her  (eschon).  Constative  second  aorist  indicative 
of  echo  including  all  seven  seriatim.    So  Matt.  22 :28  =  Mark 


254      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

12:33.    To  wife  {gunaika).    As  wife,  accusative  in  apposition 
with  "her." 

36.  Equal  unto  the  angels  {isaggeloi).  A  rare  and  late 
word  from  isos,  equal,  and  aggelos.  Only  here  in  the  N.T. 
Mark  and  Matthew  have  "as  angels"  (hos  aggeloi).  Angels 
do  not  marry,  there  is  no  marriage  in  heaven.  Sons  of  God, 
being  sons  of  the  resurrection  (huioi  theou  tes  anastaseos  huioi 
ontes).  This  Hebraistic  phrase,  "sons  of  the  resurrection" 
defines  "sons  of  God"  and  is  a  direct  answer  to  the  Sadducees. 

37.  Even  Moses  (kai  Mouses).  Moses  was  used  by  the 
Sadducees  to  support  their  denial  of  the  resurrection.  This 
passage  (Ex.  3  :6)  Jesus  skilfully  uses  as  a  proof  of  the  resur- 
rection.   See  discussion  on  Matt.  22:32  =  Mark  I2:26f. 

39.  Certain  of  the  scribes  {tines  ton  grammatebn).  Pharisees 
who  greatly  enjoyed  this  use  by  Jesus  of  a  portion  of  the 
Pentateuch  against  the  position  of  the  Sadducees.  So  they 
praise  the  reply  of  Jesus,  hostile  though  they  are  to  him. 

40.  They  durst  not  any  more  {ouketi  etolmon  ouden).  Double 
negative  and  imperfect  active  of  tolmab.  The  courage  of 
Pharisees,  Sadducees,  Herodians  vanished. 

41.  How  say  they?  (Pos  legousin;).  The  Pharisees  had 
rallied  in  glee  and  one  of  their  number,  a  lawyer,  had  made  a 
feeble  contribution  to  the  controversy  which  resulted  in  his 
agreement  with  Jesus  and  in  praise  from  Jesus  (Mark  12:28- 
34  =  Matt.  27:34-40).  Luke  does  not  give  this  incident 
which  makes  it  plain  that  by  "they  say"  {legousin)  Jesus  re- 
fers to  the  Pharisees  (rabbis,  lawyers),  carrying  on  the  discus- 
sion and  turning  the  tables  on  them  while  the  Pharisees  are 
still  gathered  together  (Matt.  22:41).  The  construction 
with  legousin  is  the  usual  infinitive  and  the  accusative  in  in- 
direct discourse.  By  "the  Christ"  {ton  Christon)  "the 
Messiah"  is  meant. 

42.  For  David  himself  {autos  gar  Daueid).  This  language 
of  Jesus  clearly  means  that  he  treats  David  as  the  author  of 
Psalm  no.    The  inspiration  of  this  Psalm  is  expressly  stated 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  255 

in  Mark  12:36  =  Matt.  22:43  (which  see)  and  the  Messianic 
character  of  the  Psalm  in  all  three  Synoptics  who  all  quote 
the  LXX  practically  alike.  Modern  criticism  that  denies 
the  Davidic  authorship  of  this  Psalm  has  to  say  either  that 
Jesus  was  ignorant  of  the  fact  about  it  or  that  he  declined  to 
disturb  the  current  acceptation  of  the  Davidic  authorship. 
Certainly  modern  scholars  are  not  agreed  on  the  authorship 
of  Psalm  no.  Meanwhile  one  can  certainly  be  excused  for 
accepting  the  natural  implication  of  the  words  of  Jesus  here, 
"David  himself."  In  the  book  of  the  Psalms  {en  bibloi  P sal- 
mon). Compare  3 14  "in  the  book  of  the  words  of  Isaiah  the 
prophet." 

44.  David  therefore  {Daueid  oun).  Without  ei  as  in  Mat- 
thew 22:45.  On  the  basis  of  this  definite  piece  of  exegesis 
{oun,  therefore)  Jesus  presses  the  problem  {pos,  how)  for  an 
explanation.  The  deity  and  the  humanity  of  the  Messiah  in 
Psalm  no  are  thus  set  forth,  the  very  problems  that  dis- 
turbed the  rabbis  then  and  that  upset  many  critics  today. 

45.  In  the  hearing  of  all  the  people  {akouontos  pantos  tou 
laou).  Genitive  absolute,  "while  all  the  people  were  listen- 
ing" (present  active  participle).  That  is  the  time  to  speak. 
The  details  in  this  verse  and  verse  47  are  precisely  those 
given  in  Mark  I2:38f.,  which  see  for  discussion  of  details. 
Matt.  23:1-39  has  a  very  full  and  rich  description  of  this 
last  phase  of  the  debate  in  the  temple  where  Jesus  drew  a 
full-length  portrait  of  the  hypocrisy  of  the  Pharisees  and 
scribes  in  their  presence.  It  was  a  solemn  climax  to  this 
last  public  appearance  of  Christ  in  the  temple  when  Jesus 
poured  out  the  vials  of  his  indignation  as  he  had  done  before 
(Matt.  6:12;  Luke  11:12,  15-18). 


CHAPTER  XXI 

1.  And  he  looked  up  (Anablepsas  de).  He  had  taken  his 
seat,  after  the  debate  was  over  and  the  Sanhedrin  had  slunk 
away  in  sheer  defeat,  "over  against  the  treasury"  (Mark 
12:41).  The  word  for  "treasury"  (gazophulakion)  is  a  com- 
pound of  gaza  (Persian  word  for  royal  treasury)  and  phulake 
guard  or  protection.  It  is  common  in  the  LXX,  but  in  the 
N.T.  only  here  and  Mark  12 141,  43  and  John  8 :2c  Jesus  was 
watching  (Mark  12:41)  the  rich  put  in  their  gifts  as  a  slight 
diversion  from  the  intense  strain  of  the  hours  before. 

2.  Poor  (penichran).  A  rare  word  from  penes  (penomai, 
to  work  for  one's  living).  Latin  penuria  and  Greek  peinao, 
to  be  hungry  are  kin  to  it.  Here  only  in  the  N.T.  Mark  1 2  42 
hasptoche,  a  more  common  word  from  ptosso,  to  be  frightened, 
to  strike  and  hide  from  fear,  to  be  in  beggary.  And  Luke 
uses  this  adjective  also  of  her  in  verse  3. 

3.  More  than  they  all  (pleion  panton).  Ablative  case  after 
the  comparative  pleion. 

4.  All  these  did  cast  (pantes  houtoi  ebalon).  Constative 
second  aorist  active  indicative  covering  the  whole  crowd 
except  the  widow.  Living  (bion).  Livelihood  as  in  Mark 
12:44,  not  zoen,  principle  of  life. 

5.  As  some  spake  (tinon  legonton).  Genitive  absolute. 
The  disciples  we  know  from  Mark  13:1  =  Matt.  24:1.  How 
(hoti).  Literally,  "that."  It  was  adorned  (kekosmetai). 
Perfect  passive  indicative,  state  of  completion,  stands 
adorned,  tense  retained  in  indirect  discourse,  though  English 
has  to  change  it.  Kosmeo,  old  and  common  verb  for  orderly 
arrangement  and  adorning.  With  goodly  stones  and  offerings 
(lithois  kalois  kai  anathemasin) .  Instrumental  case.  Some 
of  these  stones  in  the  substructure  were  enormous.     "The 

256 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  257 

columns  of  the  cloister  or  portico  were  monoliths  of  marble 
over  forty  feet  high"  (Plummer).  Cf.  Josephus,  War,  V.  5. 
The  word  anathema  (here  only  in  the  N.T.)  is  not  to  be  con- 
fused with  anathema  from  the  same  verb  anatithemi,  but 
which  came  to  mean  a  curse  (Gal.  1:8;  Acts  23:14).  So  an- 
athema came  to  mean  devoted  in  a  bad  sense,  anathema  in  a 
good  sense.  "Thus  knave,  lad,  becomes  a  rascal;  villain,  a 
farmer,  becomes  a  scoundrel;  cunning,  skilful,  becomes 
crafty"  (Vincent).  These  offerings  in  the  temple  were  very 
numerous  and  costly  (II  Mace.  3:2-7)  like  the  golden  vine 
of  Herod  with  branches  as  tall  as  a  man  (Josephus,  Ant. 
XV.  ii.  3). 

6.  As  for  these  things  {tauta).  Accusative  of  general  refer- 
ence. One  stone  upon  another  {lithos  epi  lithoi).  Stone  upon 
stone  (locative).  Here  both  Mark  13 :2  and  Matt.  24:2  have 
epi  lithon  (accusative).  Instead  of  ouk  aphethesetai  (future 
passive)  they  both  have  ou  me  aphethei  (double  negative  with 
aorist  passive  subjunctive).  It  was  a  shock  to  the  disciples 
to  hear  this  after  the  triumphal  entry. 

8.  That  ye  be  not  led  astray  {me  planethete).  First  aorist 
passive  subjunctive  with  me  (lest).  This  verb  planao  occurs 
here  only  in  Luke  though  often  in  the  rest  of  the  N.T.  (as 
Matt.  24:4,  5,  11,  24,  which  see).  Our  word  planet  is  from 
this  word.  The  time  is  at  hand  {ho  kairos  eggiken).  Just  as 
John  the  Baptist  did  of  the  kingdom  (Matt.  3 :2)  and  Jesus 
also  (Mark  1:15).  Go  ye  not  after  them  {me  poreuthete  opiso 
autbn).  First  aorist  passive  subjunctive  with  me.  A  needed 
warning  today  with  all  the  false  cries  in  the  religious  world. 

9.  Be  not  terrified  {me  ptoethete).  First  aorist  passive  sub- 
junctive with  me  from  ptoeo  an  old  verb  to  terrify,  from  ptoa, 
terror.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  24:37.  First  {Pro- 
ton). It  is  so  eas)'-  to  forget  this  and  to  insist  that  the  end 
is  "immediately"  in  spite  of  Christ's  explicit  denial  here. 
See  Matt.  24:4-42  and  Mark  13  :i— 37  for  discussion  of  details 
for  Luke  21 :8-36,  the  great  eschatological  discourse  of  Jesus 


2SS      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

11.  Famines  and  pestilences  (loimoi  kai  limoi).  Play  on 
the  two  words  pronounced  just  alike  in  the  Koine  (itacism). 
And  terrors  (phobethra  te).  The  use  of  te  .  .  .  te  in  this  verse 
groups  the  two  kinds  of  woes.  This  rare  word  phobethra 
is  only  here  in  the  N.T.  It  is  from  phobeo,  to  frighten,  and 
occurs  only  in  the  plural  as  here. 

12.  But  before  all  these  things  (pro  de  touibn  pantbn).  In 
Mark  13:8  =  Matt.  24:8  these  things  are  termed  "the  be- 
ginning of  travail."  That  may  be  the  idea  here.  Plummer 
insists  that  priority  of  time  is  the  point,  not  magnitude. 
Bringing  you  (apagomenous).  Present  passive  participle 
from  apago,  an  old  verb  to  lead  off  or  away.  But  here  the 
participle  is  in  the  accusative  plural,  not  the  nominative  like 
paradidontes  (present  active  participle,  delivering  you  up), 
agreeing  with  humas  not  expressed  the  object  of  paradi- 
dontes,  "you  being  brought  before  or  led  off."  "A  technical 
term  in  Athenian  legal  language"  (Bruce). 

13.  It  shall  turn  unto  you  (apobesetai  humin).  Future  mid- 
dle of  apobaino.  It  will  come  off,  turn  out  for  you  (dative  of 
advantage).  For  a  testimony  (eis  marturion).  To  their  loy- 
alty to  Christ.  Besides,  "the  blood  of  the  martyrs  is  the 
seed  of  the  church." 

14.  Not  to  meditate  beforehand  (me  promeletdin) .  The  clas- 
sical word  for  conning  a  speech  beforehand.  Mark  13:11  has 
promerimnao,  a  later  word  which  shows  previous  anxiety 
rather  than  previous  preparation.  How  to  answer  (apolo- 
gethenai).  First  aorist  passive  infinitive.  It  is  the  prepara- 
tion for  the  speech  of  defence  (apology)  that  Jesus  here  for- 
bids, not  the  preparation  of  a  sermon. 

15.  Your  adversaries  (hoi  antikeimenoi  humin).  Those  who 
stand  against,  line  up  face  to  face  with  (note  anti-).  To 
withstand  or  to  gainsay  (antistenai  e  anteipein).  Two  second 
aorist  active  infinitives  with  anti-  in  composition  again.  But 
these  "antis"  will  go  down  before  the  power  of  Christ. 

16.  Shall  they   cause  to  be  put  to  death   (thanatosousin). 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  259 

Future  active  of  thanatoo,  to  put  to  death  or  to  make  to  die 
(causative).  Either  makes  sense  here.  Old  and  common 
verb. 

17.  Not  a  hair  of  your  head  shall  perish  (thrix  ek  tes  kephales 
humon  ou  me  apoletai) .  Only  in  Luke.  Second  aorist  middle 
subjunctive  of  apollumi  with  ou  me  (double  negative).  Jesus 
has  just  said  that  some  they  will  put  to  death.  Hence  it  is 
spiritual  safety  here  promised  such  as  Paul  claimed  about 
death  in  Phil.  1:21. 

19.  Ye  shall  win  (ktesesthe).  Future  middle  of  ktaomai, 
to  acquire.  They  will  win  their  souls  even  if  death  does 
come. 

20.  Compassed  with  armies  (kukloumenen  hupo  strato- 
pedon).  Present  passive  participle  of  kukloo,  to  circle,  en- 
circle, from  kuklos,  circle.  Old  verb,  but  only  four  times  in 
N.T.  The  point  of  this  warning  is  the  present  tense,  being 
encircled.  It  will  be  too  late  after  the  city  is  surrounded. 
It  is  objected  by  some  that  Jesus,  not  to  say  Luke,  could 
not  have  spoken  (or  written)  these  words  before  the  Roman 
armies  came.  One  may  ask  why  not,  if  such  a  thing  as 
predictive  prophecy  can  exist  and  especially  in  the  case  of 
the  Lord  Jesus.  The  word  stratopedon  (stratos,  army,  pedon, 
plain)  is  a  military  camp  and  then  an  army  in  camp.  Old 
word,  but  only  here  in  the  N.T.  Then  know  (tote  gnote). 
Second  aorist  active  imperative  of  ginosko.  Christians  did 
flee  from  Jerusalem  to  Pella  before  it  was  too  late  as  directed 
in  Luke  21 :2i  =  Mark  13  :i4f.  =  Matt.  24:i6f. 

22.  That  may  be  fulfilled  (tou  plesthenai).  Articular  in- 
finitive passive  to  express  purpose  with  accusative  of  gen- 
eral reference.  The  O.T.  has  many  such  warnings  (Hosea 
9:7;  Deut.  28:49-57,  etc.). 

24.  Edge  of  the  sword  (stomati  machaires).  Instrumental 
case  of  stomati  which  means  "mouth"  literally  (Gen.  34:26). 
This  verse  like  the  close  of  verse  22  is  only  in  Luke.  Josephus 
(War,  VI.  9.  3)  states  that  1,100,000  Jews  perished  in  the 


260      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

destruction  of  Jerusalem  and  97,000  were  taken  captive. 
Surely  this  is  an  exaggeration  and  yet  the  number  must  have 
been  large.  Shall  be  led  captive  (aichmalbtisthesontai). 
Future  passive  of  aichmalbtizo  from  aichme,  spear  and  halbtos 
(halts komai).  Here  alone  in  the  literal  sense  in  the  N.T. 
Shall  be  trodden  under  foot  (estai  patoumene).  Future  passive 
periphrastic  of  pateo,  to  tread,  old  verb.  Until  the  times  of  the 
Gentiles  be  fulfilled  (achri  hou  plerothosin  kairoi  ethnbn). 
First  aorist  passive  subjunctive  with  achri  hou  like  hebs  hou. 
What  this  means  is  not  clear  except  that  Paul  in  Rom.  1 1 125 
shows  that  the  punishment  of  the  Jews  has  a  limit.  The 
same  idiom  appears  there  also  with  achri  hou  and  the  aorist 
subjunctive. 

25.  Distress  (sunoche).  From  sunechb.  In  the  N.T.  only 
here  and  II  Cor.  2:4.  Anguish.  In  perplexity  (en  aporiai). 
State  of  one  who  is  aporos,  who  has  lost  his  way  (a  privative 
and  poros).  Here  only  in  the  N.T.  though  an  old  and  com- 
mon word.  For  the  roaring  of  the  sea  (echous  thalasses). 
Our  word  echo  (Latin  echo)  is  this  word  echos,  a  reverberating 
sound.  Sense  of  rumour  in  Luke  4:37.  Billows  (salou).  Old 
word  salos  for  the  swell  of  the  sea.    Here  only  in  the  N.T. 

26.  Men  fainting  (apopsuchontbn  anthrbpbn).  Genitive 
absolute  of  apopsuchb,  to  expire,  to  breathe  off  or  out.  Old 
word.  Here  only  in  N.T.  Expectation  (prosdokias) .  Old 
word  from  prosdokab,  to  look  for  or  towards.  In  the  N.T. 
only  here  and  Acts  12:11.  The  world  (tei  oikoumenei).  Da- 
tive case,  "the  inhabited"  (earth,  get). 

27.  And  then  shall  they  see  (kai  tote  opsontai).  As  much  as 
to  say  that  it  will  be  not  till  then.  Clearly  the  promise  of 
the  second  coming  of  the  Son  of  man  in  glory  here  ( =  Mark 
I3:26f.  =  Matt.  24:3of.)  is  pictured  as  not  one  certain  of 
immediate  realization.  The  time  element  is  left  purposely 
vague. 

28.  Look  up  (anakupsate).  First  aorist  active  imperative 
of  anakuptb,  to  raise  up.    Here  of  the  soul  as  in  John  8  7,  10, 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  261 

but  in  Luke  13:11  of  the  body.  These  the  only  N.T.  ex- 
amples of  this  common  verb.  Redemption  {apolutrosis) . 
Act  of  redeeming  from  apolutrob.  The  final  act  at  the  second 
coming  of  Christ,  a  glorious  hope. 

29.  The  fig  tree,  and  all  the  trees  {ten  suken  kai  panta  ta 
dendra).  This  parable  of  the  fig-tree  (=  Mark  13:28-32  = 
Matt.  24:32-35)  Luke  applies  to  "all  the  trees."  It  is  true 
about  all  of  them,  but  the  fig  tree  was  very  common  in  Pales- 
tine. 

30.  Shoot  forth  {probalosin).  Second  aorist  active  sub- 
junctive of  proballo,  common  verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here 
and  Acts  19:33.  Summer  {theros).  Not  harvest,  but  sum- 
mer. Old  word,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  ( =  Mark  13:28 
=  Matt.  24:32). 

31.  Coming  to  pass  {ginomena).  Present  middle  participle 
of  ginomai  and  so  descriptive  of  the  process.  Nigh  {eggus). 
The  consummation  of  the  kingdom  is  here  meant,  not  the 
beginning. 

32.  This  generation  {he  genea  haute).  Naturally  people 
then  living.  Shall  not  pass  away  {ou  me  parelthei).  Second 
aorist  active  subjunctive  of  parerchomai.  Strongest  possible 
negative  with  ou  me.  Till  all  things  be  accomplished  {heos  an 
panta  genetai).  Second  aorist  middle  subjunctive  of  ginomai 
with  heos,  common  idiom.  The  words  give  a  great  deal  of 
trouble  to  critics.  Some  apply  them  to  the  whole  discourse 
including  the  destruction  of  the  temple  and  Jerusalem,  the 
second  coming  and  the  end  of  the  world.  Some  of  these 
argue  that  Jesus  was  simply  mistaken  in  his  eschatology, 
some  that  he  has  not  been  properly  reported  in  the  Gospels. 
Others  apply  them  only  to  the  destruction  of  Jerusalem 
which  did  take  place  in  a.d.  70  before  that  generation 
passed  away.  It  must  be  said  for  this  view  that  it  is  not 
easy  in  this  great  eschatological  discourse  to  tell  clearly 
when  Jesus  is  discussing  the  destruction  of  Jerusalem  and 
when  the  second  coming.     Plummer  offers  this  solution: 


262      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

"The  reference,  therefore,  is  to  the  destruction  of  Jerusalem 
regarded  as  the  type  of  the  end  of  the  world." 

33.  My  words  shall  not  pass  away  {hoi  logoi  mou  ou  me 
pareleusontai).  Future  middle  indicative  with  ou  me,  a  bit 
stronger  statement  than  the  subjunctive.  It  is  noteworthy 
that  Jesus  utters  these  words  just  after  the  difficult  predic- 
tion in  verse  32. 

34.  Lest  haply  your  hearts  be  overcharged  {me  pote  barethbsin 
hai  kardiai  humbn).  First  aorist  passive  subjunctive  of 
bareb,  an  old  verb  to  weigh  down,  depress,  with  me  pote. 
With  surfeiting  {en  krepalei).  A  rather  late  word,  common 
in  medical  writers  for  the  nausea  that  follows  a  debauch. 
Latin  crapula,  the  giddiness  caused  by  too  much  wine. 
Here  only  in  the  N.T.  Drunkenness  {methei).  From  methu 
(wine).  Old  word  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Rom. 
13:13;  Gal.  5:21.  Cares  of  this  life  {merimnais  bibtikais). 
Anxieties  of  life.  The  adjective  bibtikos  is  late  and  in  the 
N.T.  only  here  and  I  Cor.  6:3f.  Come  on  you  {epistei). 
Second  aorist  active  subjunctive  of  ephistemi,  ingressive 
aorist.  Construed  also  with  me  pote.  Suddenly  {ephnidios). 
Adjective  in  predicate  agreeing  with  hemera  (day).  As  a 
snare  {hbs  pagis).  Old  word  from  pegnumi,  to  make  fast  a  net 
or  trap.  Paul  uses  it  several  times  of  the  devil's  snares  for 
preachers  (I  Tim.  3:7;  II  Tim.  2:26). 

36.  But  watch  ye  {agrupneite  de).  Agrupneb  is  a  late  verb 
to  be  sleepless  {a  privative  and  hupnos,  sleep).  Keep  awake 
and  be  ready  is  the  pith  of  Christ's  warning.  That  ye  may 
prevail  to  escape  {hina  katischusete  ekphugein).  First  aorist 
active  subjunctive  with  hina  of  purpose.  The  verb  katischub 
means  to  have  strength  against  (cf.  Matt.  16:18).  Common 
in  later  writers.  Ekphugein  is  second  aorist  active  infinitive, 
to  escape  out.  To  stand  before  the  Son  of  man  {stathenai 
emprosthen  tou  huiou  tou  anthrbpou).  That  is  the  goal. 
There  will  be  no  dread  of  the  Son  then  if  one  is  ready. 
Stathenai  is  first  aorist  passive  infinitive  of  histemi. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  263 

37.  Every  day  {tas  hemeras).  During  the  days,  accusative 
of  extent  of  time.  Every  night  {tas  nuktas).  "During  the 
nights,"  accusative  of  extent  of  time.  Lodged  (eulizeto). 
Imperfect  middle,  was  lodging,  aulizomai  from  aule  (court). 

38.  Came  early  (orthrizen).  Imperfect  active  of  orthrizb 
from  orthros,  late  form  for  orthreud,  to  rise  early.  Only  here 
in  the  N.T. 


CHAPTER  XXII 

1.  The  Passover  (pascha)  Both  names  (unleavened 
bread  and  passover)  are  used  here  as  in  Mark  14:1.  Strictly 
speaking  the  passover  was  Nisan  14  and  the  unleavened 
bread  15-21.  This  is  the  only  place  in  the  N.T.  where  the 
expression  "the  feast  of  unleavened  bread"  (common  in 
LXX,  Ex.  23:  15,  etc.)  occurs,  for  Mark  14:1  has  just  "the 
unleavened  bread."  Matt.  26:17  uses  unleavened  bread 
and  passover  interchangeably.  Drew  nigh  (eggizen).  Im- 
perfect active.  Mark  14:1  and  Matt.  26:2  mention  "after 
two  days"  definitely. 

2.  Sought  (ezetoun).  Imperfect  active  of  zeteo,  were  seek- 
ing, conative  imperfect.  How  they  might  put  him  to  death 
{to  pbs  anelbsin  auton).  Second  aorist  active  deliberative 
subjunctive  (retained  in  indirect  question)  of  anaired,  to  take 
up,  to  make  away  with,  to  slay.  Common  in  Old  Greek. 
Luke  uses  it  so  here  and  in  23:32  and  eighteeen  times  in  the 
Acts,  a  favourite  word  with  him.  Note  the  accusative  neuter 
singular  article  to  with  the  whole  clause,  "as  to  the  how,  etc." 
For  they  feared  (ephobounto  gar).  Imperfect  middle  describ- 
ing the  delay  of  the  "how."  The  triumphal  entry  and  the 
temple  speeches  of  Jesus  had  revealed  his  tremendous  power 
with  the  people,  especially  the  crowds  from  Galilee  at  the 
feast.  They  were  afraid  to  go  on  with  their  plan  to  kill  him 
at  the  feast. 

3.  Satan  entered  into  Judas  (eiselthen  eis  Ioudan).  Ingres- 
sive  aorist  active  indicative.  Satan  was  now  renewing  his 
attack  on  Jesus  suspended  temporarily  (Luke  4:13)  "until  a 
good  chance."  He  had  come  back  by  the  use  of  Simon 
Peter  (Mark  8:33  =  Matt.  16:23).  The  conflict  went  on 
and  Jesus  won  ultimate  victory  (Luke  10:18).    Now  Satan 

264 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  265 

uses  Judas  and  has  success  with  him  for  Judas  allowed  him 
to  come  again  and  again  (John  13:27).  Judas  evidently- 
opened  the  door  to  his  heart  and  let  Satan  in.  Then  Satan 
took  charge  and  he  became  a  devil  as  Jesus  said  (John  6:70). 
This  surrender  to  Satan  in  no  way  relieves  Judas  of  his  moral 
responsibility. 

4.  Went  away  {apelthon).  Second  aorist  active  participle 
of  aperchomai.  He  went  off  under  the  impulse  of  Satan  and 
after  the  indignation  over  the  rebuke  of  Jesus  at  the  feast  in 
Simon's  house  (John  12:4-6).  Captains  {str  ate  gois).  Leaders 
of  the  temple  guards  (Acts  4:1),  the  full  title,  "captains  of 
the  temple,"  occurs  in  verse  52.  How  he  might  deliver  him 
unto  them  {to  pbs  autois  paradoi  auton).  The  same  construc- 
tion as  in  verse  2,  the  article  to  with  the  indirect  question  and 
deliberative  subjunctive  second  aorist  active  {paradoi). 

5.  Were  glad  {e  chares  an).  Second  aorist  passive  indicative 
of  chairo  as  in  Mark  14:11.  Ingressive  aorist,  a  natural 
exultation  that  one  of  the  Twelve  had  offered  to  do  this  thing. 
Covenanted  {sunethento) .  Second  aorist  indicative  middle  of 
suntithemi.  An  old  verb  to  put  together  and  in  the  middle 
with  one  another.  In  the  N.T.  outside  of  John  9:22  only  in 
Luke  (here  and  Acts  23:20;  24:9).  Luke  only  mentions 
"money"  {argurion),  but  not  "thirty  pieces"  (Matt.  26:15). 

6.  Consented  {exomologesen).  Old  verb,  but  the  ancients 
usually  used  the  simple  form  for  promise  or  consent  rather 
than  the  compound.  This  is  the  only  instance  of  this  sense 
in  the  N.T.  It  is  from  homologos  {homos,  same,  and  lego,  to 
say),  to  say  the  same  thing  with  another  and  so  agree.  Op- 
portunity {eukarian).  From  eukairos  {eu,  kairos),  a  good 
chance.  Old  word,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  parallel 
passage  Matt.  26:16.  In  the  absence  of  the  multitude  {ater 
ochlou).  Ater  is  an  old  preposition,  common  in  the  poets, 
but  rare  in  prose.  Also  in  verse  35.  It  means  "without," 
"apart  from,"  like  choris.  The  point  of  Judas  was  just 
this.    He  would  get  Jesus  into  the  hands  of  the  Sanhedrin 


266      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

during  the  feast  in  spite  of  the  crowd.  It  was  necessary 
to  avoid  tumult  (Matt.  26:5)  because  of  the  popularity  of 
Jesus. 

7.  The  day  of  unleavened  bread  came  {elthen  he  hemera  ton 
azumbn).  The  day  itself  came,  not  simply  was  drawing  nigh 
(verse  1).  Must  be  sacrificed  (edei  thuesthai).  This  was 
Nisan  14  which  began  at  sunset.  Luke  is  a  Gentile  and  this 
fact  must  be  borne  in  mind.  The  lamb  must  be  slain  by  the 
head  of  the  family  (Ex.  12:6).  The  controversy  about  the 
day  when  Christ  ate  the  last  passover  meal  has  already 
been  discussed  (Matt.  26:17  =Mark  14:12).  The  Synoptics 
clearly  present  this  as  a  fact.  Jesus  was  then  crucified  on 
Friday  at  the  passover  or  Thursday  (our  time)  at  the  regular 
hour  6  p.m.  (beginning  of  Friday).  The  five  passages  in 
John  (13  :if.;  13:27;  18:28;  19:14;  19:31)  rightly  interpreted 
teach  the  same  thing  as  shown  in  my  Harmony  of  the  Gospels 
for  Students  of  the  Life  of  Christ  (pp.  279-284). 

8.  Peter  and  John  (Petron  kai  Ibanen).  Mark  14:13  has 
only  "two"  while  Matt.  26:17  makes  the  disciples  take  the 
initiative.  The  word  passover  in  this  context  is  used  either 
of  the  meal,  the  feast  day,  the  whole  period  (including  the 
unleavened  bread).  "Eat  the  passover"  can  refer  to  the 
meal  as  here  or  to  the  whole  period  of  celebration  (John 
18:28). 

9.  Where  wilt  thou  that  we  make  ready?  (Pou  theleis  hetoi- 
masbmen;).  Deliberative  first  aorist  active  subjunctive 
without  hina  after  theleis,  perhaps  originally  two  separate 
questions. 

10.  When  you  are  entered  (eiselthontbn  humbn).  Genitive 
absolute.  Meet  you  {sunaniesei  humin).  An  old  verb  sun- 
antab  (from  sun,  with,  and  antab,  to  face,  anti)  with  associa- 
tive instrumental  {humin).  See  on  Mark  14:13  about  the 
"man  bearing  a  pitcher  of  water." 

11.  Goodman  of  the  house  (oikodespotei).  Master  of  the 
house  as  in  Mark  14:14  and  Matt.  10:25.    A  late  word  for  the 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  267 

earlier  despoies  oikou.     I  shall  eat  (phagb).     Second  aorist 
futuristic  (or  deliberative)  subjunctive  as  in  Mark  14:14. 

12.  And  he  (k' 'akeinos) .  Kai  and  ekeinos  (crasis)  where 
Mark  14:15  has  kai  autos.  Literally,  And  that  one.  See  on 
Mark  for  rest  of  the  verse. 

13.  He  had  said  (eirekei).  Past  perfect  active  indicative 
of  eipon  where  Mark  14:16  has  eipen  (second  aorist). 

14.  Sat  down  (anepesen).  Reclined,  fell  back  (or  up). 
Second  aorist  active  of  anapipib. 

15.  With  desire  I  have  desired  (epithumiai  epethumesd). 
A  Hebraism  common  in  the  LXX.  Associative  instrumental 
case  of  substantive  and  first  aorist  active  indicative  of  same 
like  a  cognate  accusative.  Peculiar  to  Luke  is  all  this  verse. 
See  this  idiom  in  John  3  :29;  Acts  4:17.  Before  I  suffer  {pro 
tou  me  pathein).  Preposition  pro  with  articular  infinitive  and 
accusative  of  general  reference,  "before  the  suffering  as  to 
me."     Pathein  is  second  aorist  active  infinitive  of  pascho. 

16.  Until  it  be  fulfilled  (heos  hotou  plerothei).  First  aorist 
passive  subjunctive  of  pier 00  with  heos  (hotou),  the  usual 
construction  about  the  future.  It  seems  like  a  Messianic 
banquet  that  Jesus  has  in  mind  (cf.  14:15). 

17.  He  received  a  cup  (dexamenos  poterion).  This  cup  is  a 
diminutive  of  poter.  It  seems  that  this  is  still  one  of  the  four 
cups  passed  during  the  passover  meal,  though  which  one  is 
uncertain.  It  is  apparently  just  before  the  formal  introduc- 
tion of  the  Lord's  Supper,  though  he  gave  thanks  here  also 
(eucharistesas).  It  is  from  this  verb  eucharisted  (see  also 
verse  19)  that  our  word  Eucharist  comes.  It  is  a  common 
verb  for  giving  thanks  and  was  used  also  for  "saying  grace" 
as  we  call  it. 

18.  The  fruit  of  the  vine  (tou  genematos  tes  ampelou).  So 
Mark  14:25  =  Matt.  26:29  and  not  oinos  though  it  was  wine 
undoubtedly.  But  the  language  allows  anything  that  is 
"the  fruit  of  the  vine."  Come  (elthei).  Second  aorist  active 
subjunctive  with  heos  as  in  verse  16.    Here  it  is  the  consum- 


268      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

mation  of  the  kingdom  that  Jesus  has  in  mind,  for  the  king- 
dom had  already  come. 

19.  Which  is  given  for  you  (to  huper  humbn  didomenon). 
Some  MSS.  omit  these  verses  though  probably  genuine. 
The  correct  text  in  I  Cor.  11:24  has  "which  is  for  you," 
not  "which  is  broken  for  you."  It  is  curious  to  find  the  word 
"broken"  here  preserved  and  justified  so  often,  even  by 
Easton  in  his  commentary  on  Luke,  p.  320.  In  remembrance 
of  me  (eis  ten  emen  anamnesin).  Objective  use  of  the  posses- 
sive pronoun  emen,  not  the  subjective.  This  do  (touto 
poieite).  Present  active  indicative,  repetition,  keep  on  doing 
this. 

20.  After  the  supper  (meta  to  deipnesai).  Preposition  meta 
and  the  accusative  articular  infinitive.  The  textual  situation 
here  is  confusing,  chiefly  because  of  the  two  cups  (verses  17 
and  20).  Some  of  the  documents  omit  the  latter  part  of 
verse  19  and  all  of  verse  20.  It  is  possible,  of  course,  that  this 
part  crept  into  the  text  of  Luke  from  I  Cor.  11 :24f.  But,  if 
this  part  is  omitted,  Luke  would  then  have  the  order  re- 
versed, the  cup  before  the  bread.  So  there  are  difficulties 
whichever  turn  one  takes  here  with  Luke's  text  whether  one 
cup  or  two  cups.  The  New  Covenant  (he  kaine  diatheke).  See 
on  Matt.  26:28  =  Mark  14:24  for  "covenant."  Westcott  and 
Hort  reject  "new"  there,  but  accept  it  here  and  in  I  Cor. 
11:25.  See  on  Luke  5:38  for  difference  between  kaine  and 
nea.  "The  ratification  of  a  covenant  was  commonly  as- 
sociated with  the  shedding  of  blood;  and  what  was  written 
in  blood  was  believed  to  be  indelible"  (Plummer).  Poured 
out  (ekchunnomenon) .  Same  word  in  Mark  14:24  =  Matt. 
26:28  translated  "shed."  Late  form  present  passive  parti- 
ciple of  ekchunnb  of  ekcheo,  to  pour  out. 

21.  That  betrayeth  (tou  paradidontos).  Present  active 
participle,  actually  engaged  in  doing  it.  The  hand  of  Judas 
was  resting  on  the  table  at  the  moment.  It  should  be  noted 
that  Luke  narrates  the  institution  of  the  Lord's  Supper  before 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  269 

the  exposure  of  Judas  as  the  traitor  while  Mark  and  Matthew 
reverse  this  order. 

22.  As  it  hath  been  determined  (kata  to  hbrismenon).  Perfect 
passive  participle  of  horizo,  to  limit  or  define,  mark  off"  the 
border,  our  "horizon."  But  this  fact  does  not  absolve  Judas 
of  his  guilt  as  the  "woe"  here  makes  plain. 

23.  Which  of  them  it  was  {to  tis  ara  eie  ex  autbn).  Note 
the  article  to  with  the  indirect  question  as  in  verses  2  and  4. 
The  optative  eie  here  is  changed  from  the  present  active 
indicative  estin,  though  it  was  not  always  done,  for  see  dokei 
in  verse  24  where  the  present  indicative  is  retained.  They 
all  had  their  hands  on  the  table.    Whose  hand  was  it? 

24.  Contention  (philoneikia).  Anoldwordfromphiloneikos, 
fond  of  strife,  eagerness  to  contend.  Only  here  in  the  N.T. 
Greatest  {meizbn).  Common  use  of  the  comparative  as  super- 
lative. 

25.  Have  lordship  over  (kurieuousin) .  From  kurios.  Com- 
mon verb,  to  lord  it  over.  Benefactors  {euergetai).  From 
eu  and  ergon.  Doer  of  good.  Old  word.  Here  only  in  the 
N.T.    Latin  Benefactor  is  exact  equivalent. 

26.  Become  {ginesthb).  Present  middle  imperative  of 
ginomai.    Act  so.    True  greatness  is  in  service,  not  in  rank. 

27.  But  I  {Ego  de).  Jesus  dares  to  cite  his  own  conduct, 
though  their  leader,  to  prove  his  point  and  to  put  a  stop  to 
their  jealous  contention  for  the  chief  place  at  this  very 
feast,  a  wrangling  that  kept  up  till  Jesus  had  to  arise  and 
give  them  the  object  lesson  of  humility  by  washing  their 
feet  (John  13:1-20). 

28.  In  my  temptations  {en  tois  peirasmois  mou).  Prob- 
ably "trials"  is  better  here  as  in  James  1:2  though  tempta- 
tions clearly  in  James  1  :i3fF.  This  is  the  tragedy  of  the  situa- 
tion when  Jesus  is  facing  the  Cross  with  the  traitor  at  the 
table  and  the  rest  chiefly  concerned  about  their  own  pri- 
macy and  dignity. 

29.  And  I  appoint  unto  you   {kagb  diatithemai  humin). 


270      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

They  had  on  the  whole  been  loyal  and  so  Jesus  passes  on  to 
them  (diathemai  verb  from  which  diatheke  comes). 

30.  And  ye  shall  sit  (kathesesthe).  But  Westcott  and 
Hort  read  in  the  text  kathesthe  (present  middle  subjunctive 
with  hind).  The  picture  seems  to  be  that  given  in  Matt. 
19:28  when  Jesus  replied  to  Peter's  inquiry.  It  is  not  clear 
how  literally  this  imagery  is  to  be  taken.  But  there  is  the 
promise  of  honour  for  the  loyal  among  these  in  the  end. 

31.  Asked  to  have  you  (exeitesato).  First  aorist  indirect 
middle  indicative  of  exaiteo,  an  old  verb  to  beg  something 
of  one  and  (middle)  for  oneself.  Only  here  in  the  N.T.  The 
verb  is  used  either  in  the  good  or  the  bad  sense,  but  it  does 
not  mean  here  "obtained  by  asking"  as  margin  in  Re- 
vised Version  has  it.  That  he  might  sift  you  (tou  siniasai). 
Genitive  articular  infinitive  of  purpose.  First  aorist  active 
infinitive  of  siniazo,  to  shake  a  sieve,  to  sift,  from  sinion,  a 
winnowing  fan.    Later  word.    Here  only  in  the  N.T. 

32.  That  thy  faith  fail  not  (hina  me  eklipei  he  pistis  mou). 
Second  aorist  active  subjunctive  of  purpose  with  hina  after 
edeethen  (I  prayed)  of  ekleipo,  old  verb.  Our  word  eclipse 
is  this  word.  Evidently  Jesus  could  not  keep  Satan  from 
attacking  Peter.  He  had  already  captured  Judas.  Did 
he  not  repeatedly  attack  Jesus?  But  he  could  and  did  pray 
for  Peter's  faith  and  his  praying  won  in  the  end,  though 
Peter  stumbled  and  fell.  And  do  thou  (kai  su).  The  words 
single  out  Peter  sharply.  Once  thou  hast  turned  again  (pote 
epistrepsas).  First  aorist  active  participle  of  epistrepho,  com- 
mon verb  to  turn  to,  to  return.  But  the  use  of  this  word 
implied  that  Peter  would  fall  though  he  would  come  back 
and  "strengthen  thy  brethren." 

33.  To  prison  and  to  death  (eis  phulaken  kai  eis  thanaton). 
Evidently  Peter  was  not  flattered  by  the  need  of  Christ's 
earnest  prayers  for  his  welfare  and  loyalty.  Hence  this  loud 
boast. 

34.  Until  thou  shalt  thrice  deny  that  thou  knowest  me  (heos 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  271 

tris  me  aparnesei  eidenai).  "Thrice"  is  in  all  four  Gospels 
here  for  they  all  give  this  warning  to  Peter  (Mark  14:30  = 
Matt.  26:34  =  Luke  22:34=  John  18:38).  Peter  will  even 
deny  knowing  Jesus  {eidenai) . 

35.  Without  purse  {ater  ballantiou).  Money  bag  or  purse. 
Old  word,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  in  Luke  (10:4;  12:33;  22: 
35ff.).  Wallet  {per as).  See  on  Matt.  10:10.  Lacked  ye 
anything  {me  tinos  husteresate;).  Answer  No  expected  {ou- 
thenos  below).    Ablative  case  after  hustereb. 

36.  Buy  a  sword  {agorasatb  machairan).  This  is  for  de- 
fence clearly.  The  reference  is  to  the  special  mission  in 
Galilee  (Luke  9:1-6  =  Mark  6:6-13  =  Matt.  9:35-11:1). 
They  are  to  expect  persecution  and  bitter  hostility  (John 
15:18-21).  Jesus  does  not  mean  that  his  disciples  are  to 
repel  force  by  force,  but  that  they  are  to  be  ready  to  defend 
his  cause  against  attack.  Changed  conditions  bring  changed 
needs.     This    language    can   be   misunderstood   as   it  was 

then. 

38.  Lord,  behold,  here  are  two  swords  {kurie  idou  machairai 
hbde  duo).  They  took  his  words  literally.  And  before  this 
very  night  is  over  Peter  will  use  one  of  these  very  swords  to 
try  to  cut  off  the  head  of  Malchus  only  to  be  sternly  rebuked 
by  Jesus  (Mark  14:47  =  Matt.  26:511.  =  Luke  22:501.  = 
John  i8:iof.).  Then  Jesus  will  say:  "For  all  that  take  the 
sword  shall  perish  with  the  sword"  (Matt.  26:52).  Clearly 
Jesus  did  not  mean  his  language  even  about  the  sword  to 
be  pressed  too  literally.  So  he  said:  "It  is  enough"  {Hi- 
kanon  estin).  It  is  with  sad  irony  and  sorrow  that  Jesus 
thus  dismisses  the  subject.  They  were  in  no  humour  now  to 
understand  the  various  sides  of  this  complicated  problem. 
Every  preacher  and  teacher  understands  this  mood,  not  of 
impatience,  but  of  closing  the  subject  for  the  present. 

39.  As  his  custom  was  {kata  to  ethos).  According  to  the 
custom  (of  him).  It  was  because  Judas  knew  the  habit  of 
Jesus  of  going  to  Gethsemane  at  night  that  he  undertook 


272      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

to  betray  him  without  waiting  for  the  crowd  to  go  home 
after  the  feast. 

40.  At  the  place  (epi  tou  topou).  The  place  of  secret  prayer 
which  was  dear  to  Jesus.  Pray  that  ye  enter  not  into  tempta- 
tion (proseuchesthe  me  eiselthein  eis  peirasmon).  "Keep  on 
praying  not  to  enter  (ingressive  aorist  infinitive,  not  even 
once)  into  temptation."  It  is  real  "temptation"  here,  not 
just  "trial."  Jesus  knew  the  power  of  temptation  and  the 
need  of  prayer.  These  words  throw  a  light  on  the  meaning 
of  his  language  in  Matt.  6:13.  Jesus  repeats  this  warning 
in  verse  46. 

41.  About  a  stone's  throw  (hosei  lithou  bolen).  Accusative 
of  extent  of  space.  Luke  does  not  tell  of  leaving  eight  disci- 
ples by  the  entrance  to  Gethsemane  nor  about  taking  Peter, 
James,  and  John  further  in  with  him.  Kneeled  down  (theis  ta 
gonaia).  Second  aorist  active  participle  from  tithemi.  Mark 
14:35  says  "fell  on  the  ground"  and  Matt.  26:39  "feM  on 
his  face."  All  could  be  true  at  different  moments.  Prayed 
(proseucheto).  Imperfect  middle,  was  praying,  kept  on  pray- 
ing. 

42.  If  thou  be  willing  (ei  boulei).  This  condition  is  in  the 
first  petition  at  the  start.  Be  done  (ginestho).  Present  mid- 
dle imperative,  keep  on  being  done,  the  Father's  will. 

43.  An  angel  (aggelos).  The  angels  visited  Jesus  at  the 
close  of  the  three  temptations  at  the  beginning  of  his 
ministry  (Matt.  4:11).  Here  the  angel  comes  during  the 
conflict. 

44.  In  an  agony  {en  agoniai).  It  was  conflict,  contest 
from  agon.  An  old  word,  but  only  here  in  the  N.T.  Satan 
pressed  Jesus  harder  than  ever  before.  As  it  were  great  drops 
of  blood  (hosei  thromboi  haimatos).  Thick,  clotted  blood. 
An  old  word  {thromboi)  common  in  medical  works,  but  here 
only  in  the  N.T.  This  passage  (verses  43  and  44)  is  absent 
from  some  ancient  documents.  Aristotle  speaks  of  a  bloody 
sweat  as  does  Theophrastus. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  273 

45.  Sleeping  for  sorrow  {koimomenous  apo  tes  lupes). 
Luke  does  not  tell  of  the  three  turnings  of  Jesus  to  the  trusted 
three  for  human  sympathy. 

46.  Why  sleep  ye?  {Ti  katheudete;).  This  reproach  Luke 
gives,  but  not  the  almost  bitter  details  in  Mark  14:37-42  = 
Matt.  26:40-46). 

47.  Went  before  them  (proercheto) .  Imperfect  middle. 
Judas  was  leading  the  band  for  he  knew  the  place  well 
(John  18:2). 

48.  With  a  kiss  {philemaxi).  Instrumental  case.  Jesus 
challenges  the  act  of  Judas  openly  and  calls  it  betrayal, 
but  it  did  not  stop  him. 

49.  What  would  follow  {to  esomenon).  Article  and  the 
future  middle  participle  of  eimi,  to  be.  Shall  we  smite  with 
a  sword?  {ei  pataxomen  en  machairei;).  Note  ei  in  a  direct 
question  like  the  Hebrew.  Luke  alone  gives  this  question. 
Instrumental  use  of  en.  They  had  the  two  swords  already 
mentioned  (22:38). 

50.  His  right  ear  {to  ous  autou  to  dexion).  Mark  14:47 
and  Matt.  26:51  do  not  mention  "right,"  but  Luke  the 
Physician  does.  John  18:10  follows  Luke  in  this  item  and 
also  adds  the  names  of  Peter  and  of  Malchus  since  probably 
both  were  dead  by  that  time  and  Peter  would  not  be  in- 
volved in  trouble. 

51.  Suffer  us  thus  far  {eate  heos  toutou).  Present  active 
imperative  of  edo,  to  allow.  But  the  meaning  is  not  clear. 
If  addressed  to  Peter  and  the  other  disciples  it  means  that 
they  are  to  suffer  this  much  of  violence  against  Jesus.  This 
is  probably  the  idea.  If  it  is  addressed  to  the  crowd,  it 
means  that  they  are  to  excuse  Peter  for  his  rash  act.  He 
touched  his  ear  and  healed  him  {hapsamenos  tou  otiou  iasato 
auton).  Whether  Jesus  picked  up  the  piece  of  the  ear  and 
put  it  back  is  not  said.  He  could  have  healed  the  wound 
without  that.  This  miracle  of  surgery  is  given  alone  by 
Luke. 


274      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

52.  As  against  a  robber?  (hos  epi  leisten;).  They  were 
treating  Jesus  as  if  he  were  a  bandit  like  Barabbas. 

53.  But  this  is  your  hour  (aW  haute  estin  humon  he  hbra). 
So  Jesus  surrenders.  The  moral  value  of  his  atoning  sacri- 
fice on  the  Cross  consists  in  the  voluntariness  of  his  death. 
He  makes  it  clear  that  they  have  taken  undue  advantage 
of  him  in  this  hour  of  secret  prayer  and  had  failed  to  seize 
him  in  public  in  the  temple.  But  "the  power  of  darkness" 
{he  exousia  tou  skotous),  had  its  turn.  A  better  day  will 
come.    The  might,  authority  of  darkness. 

54.  Into  the  high  priest's  house  (eis  ten  oikian  tou  archie- 
reos).  Luke  alone  mentions  "the  house."  Though  it  is  im- 
plied in  Mark  14:53  =  Matt.  26:57.  Followed  (ekolouthei). 
Imperfect,  was  following,  as  Matt.  26:58  and  John  18:15. 
Curiously  Mark  14:54  has  the  aorist. 

55.  When  they  had  kindled  afire  (periapsantbn  pur).  Geni- 
tive absolute,  first  aorist  active  participle  of  periapto,  an 
old  verb,  but  here  only  in  the  N.T.  Kindle  around,  make  a 
good  fire  that  blazes  all  over.  It  was  April  and  cool  at  night. 
The  servants  made  the  fire.  And  had  sat  down  together  (kai 
sunkathisanton).  Genitive  absolute  again.  Note  sun-  (to- 
gether), all  had  taken  seats  around  the  fire.  Peter  sat  in 
the  midst  of  them  (ekatheto  ho  Petros  mesos  anion).  Imperfect 
tense,  he  was  sitting,  and  note  mesos,  nominative  predicate 
adjective  with  the  genitive,  like  John  1 :26,  good  Greek 
idiom. 

56.  In  the  light  (pros  to  phos).  Facing  (pros)  the  light,  for 
the  fire  gave  light  as  well  as  heat.  Mark  14:65  has  "warming 
himself  in  the  light,"  John  (18:18,  25)  "warming  himself." 
Looking  steadfastly  (atenisasa).  Favourite  word  in  Luke 
(4:20,  etc.)  for  gazing  steadily  at  one.  This  man  also  (kai 
houtos) .  As  if  pointing  to  Peter  and  talking  about  him.  The 
other  Gospels  (Mark  14:67  =Matt.  26:69=  John  18:25) 
make  a  direct  address  to  Peter.  Both  could  be  true,  as  she 
turned  to  Peter. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  275 

57.  /  know  him  not  {ouk  oida  autori).  Just  as  Jesus  had 
predicted  that  he  would  do  (Luke  22:34). 

58.  After  a  little  while  another  {meta  brachu  heteros). 
Matt.  26:71  makes  it  after  Peter  had  gone  out  into  the  porch 
and  mentions  a  maid  as  speaking  as  does  Mark  14:69,  while 
here  the  "other"  {heteros)  is  a  man  (masculine  gender).  It  is 
almost  impossible  to  co-ordinate  the  three  denials  in  the  four 
accounts  unless  we  conceive  of  several  joining  in  when  one 
led  off.    This  time  Peter's  denial  is  very  blunt,  "  I  am  not." 

59.  After  the  space  of  about  one  hour  {diastases  hosei  horas 
mias).  Genitive  absolute  with  second  aorist  active  participle 
feminine  singular  of  diistemi.  This  classical  verb  in  the  N.T. 
is  used  only  by  Luke  (22:59;  24:51;  Acts  27:28).  It  means 
standing  in  two  or  apart,  about  an  hour  intervening.  Con- 
fidently affirmed  {diischurizeto).  Imperfect  middle,  he  kept 
affirming  strongly.  An  old  verb  {dia,  ischurizomai),  to  make 
oneself  strong,  to  make  emphatic  declaration.  In  the  N.T. 
only  here  and  Acts  12:15.  F°r  he  is  a  Galilean  {kai  gar 
Galilaios  estin).  Matt.  26:73  makes  it  plain  that  it  was  his 
speech  that  gave  him  away,  which  see. 

60.  /  know  not  what  thou  say  est  {ouk  oida  ho  legeis).  Each 
denial  tangles  Peter  more  and  more.  While  he  yet  spake 
{eti  lalountos  autou).  Genitive  absolute.  Peter  could  hear 
the  crowing  all  right. 

61.  The  Lord  turned  {strapheis  ho  kurios).  Second  aorist 
passive  participle  of  strepho,  coming  verb.  Graphic  picture 
drawn  by  Luke  alone.  Looked  upon  Peter  {eneblepsen  toi 
Petroi).  Ingressive  aorist  active  indicative  of  enblepo,  an 
old  and  vivid  verb,  to  glance  at.  Remembered  {hupemnesthe). 
First  aorist  passive  indicative  of  hupomimnesko,  common 
verb  to  remind  one  of  something  {hupo  giving  a  suggestion 
or  hint).  The  cock  crowing  and  the  look  brought  swiftly 
back  to  Peter's  mind  the  prophecy  of  Jesus  and  his  sad 
denials.    The  mystery  is  how  he  had  forgotten  that  warning. 

62.  And  he  went  out  and  wept  bitterly  {kai  exelthon  exo 


276      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

eklausen  pikros).  A  few  old  Latin  documents  omit  this  verse 
which  is  genuine  in  Matt.  26:75.  It  may  be  an  insertion 
here  from  there,  but  the  evidence  for  the  rejection  is  too 
slight.  It  is  the  ingressive  aorist  (eklausen),  he  burst  into 
tears.  "Bitter"  is  a  common  expression  for  tears  in  all 
languages  and  in  all  hearts. 

63.  That  held  (hoi  sunechontes).  See  on  8:45;  19:43  for  this 
verb  sunechb.  Here  alone  in  the  N.T.  for  holding  a  prisoner 
(holding  together).  The  servants  or  soldiers,  not  the  San- 
hedrim Mocked  (enepaizon).  Imperfect  active,  were  mock- 
ing, inchoative,  began  to  mock,  to  play  like  boys.  And  beat 
him  (derontes).  Present  active  participle  of  dero,  to  flay,  tan, 
or  hide.    Literally,  "beating." 

64.  Blindfolded  (perikalups antes).  First  aorist  active  par- 
ticiple of  perikalupto,  old  verb,  to  put  a  veil  around.  In  the 
N.T.  only  here  and  Mark  14:65.  See  Mark  14:65  and  Matt. 
26:67f.  for  further  discussion. 

65.  Many  other  things  (hetera  polla).  These  are  just  sam- 
ples. 

66.  As  soon  as  it  was  day  (hos  egeneto  hemera).  Mark 
15:1  (  =  Matt.  27:1)  has  "morning."  The  assembly  of  the 
people  (to  presbutezion  tou  laou).  The  technical  word  for 
"the  eldership"  (from  presbuteros,  an  old  man  or  elder)  or 
group  of  the  elders  composing  the  Sanhedrin.  The  word 
occurs  in  the  LXX  for  the  Sanhedrin.  In  the  N.T.  occurs 
only  here  and  Acts  22:5  of  the  Sanhedrin.  In  I  Tim.  4:14 
Paul  uses  it  of  the  elders  in  a  church  (or  churches).  The 
Sanhedrin  was  composed  of  the  elders  and  scribes  and  chief 
priests  (Mark  15:1)  and  all  three  groups  are  at  this  meeting. 
Luke's  language  (both  chief  priests  and  scribes,  te  .  .  .  kai) 
seems  to  apply  the  word  presbuterion  to  the  whole  Sanhedrin. 
Sadducees  (chief  priests)  and  Pharisees  (scribes)  were  nearly 
equally  represented.  Into  their  council  (eis  to  sunedrion 
auton) .  The  place  of  the  gathering  is  not  given,  but  Jesus  was 
led  into  the  council  chamber. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  277 

67.  //  thou  art  the  Christ  {Ei  su  ei  ho  Christos).  The  Mes- 
siah, they  mean.  The  condition  is  the  first  class,  assuming  it 
to  be  true.  If  I  tell  you  (Ean  humin  eipo).  Condition  of  the 
third  class,  undetermined,  but  with  likelihood  of  being 
determined.  This  is  the  second  appearance  of  Jesus  before 
the  Sanhedrin  merely  mentioned  by  Mark  15:1  and  Matt. 
27:1  who  give  in  detail  the  first  appearance  and  trial.  Luke 
merely  gives  this  so-called  ratification  meeting  after  daybreak 
to  give  the  appearance  of  legality  to  their  vote  of  condemna- 
tion already  taken  (Mark  14:64  =  Matt.  26:66).  Ye  will  not 
believe  {pu  me  pisteusete).  Double  negative  with  the  aorist 
subjunctive,  strongest  possible  negative.    So  as  to  verse  68. 

69.  The  Son  of  man  {ho  huios  tou  anthropou).  Jesus  really 
answers  their  demand  about  "the  Messiah"  by  asserting  that 
he  is  "the  Son  of  man"  and  they  so  understand  him.  He 
makes  claims  of  equality  with  God  also  which  they  take  up. 

70.  Art  thou  the  Son  of  God?  (Su  oun  ei  ho  huios  tou  theou;). 
Note  how  these  three  epithets  are  used  as  practical  equiva- 
lents. They  ask  about  "the  Messiah."  Jesus  affirms  that 
he  is  the  Son  of  Man  and  will  sit  at  the  right  hand  of  the 
power  of  God.  They  take  this  to  be  a  claim  to  be  the  Son  of 
God  (both  humanity  and  deity).  Jesus  accepts  the  challenge 
and  admits  that  he  claims  to  be  all  three  (Messiah,  the  Son 
of  man,  the  Son  of  God).  Ye  say  (Humeis  legete).  Just 
a  Greek  idiom  for  "Yes"  (compare  "I  am"  in  Mark  14:62 
with  "Thou  has  said"  in  Matt.  26:64). 

71.  For  we  ourselves  have  heard  (autoi  gar  ekousamen). 
They  were  right  if  Jesus  is  not  what  he  claimed  to  be.  They 
were  eternally  wrong  for  he  is  the  Christ,  the  Son  of  man, 
the  Son  of  God.  They  made  their  choice  and  must  face 
Christ  as  Judge. 


CHAPTER  XXIII 

1.  The  whole  company  {hapan  to  plethos).  All  but  Nicode- 
mus  and  Joseph  of  Arimathea  who  were  probably  not  invited 
to  this  meeting. 

2.  Began  to  accuse  (erxanto  kategorein).  They  went  at  it 
and  kept  it  up.  Luke  mentions  three,  but  neither  of  them 
includes  their  real  reason  nor  do  they  mention  their  own  con- 
demnation of  Jesus.  They  had  indulged  their  hatred  in  doing 
it,  but  they  no  longer  have  the  power  of  life  and  death. 
Hence  they  say  nothing  to  Pilate  of  that.  We  found  {heura- 
men).  Second  aorist  active  indicative  with  first  aorist  vowel 
a.  Probably  they  mean  that  they  had  caught  Jesus  in  the 
act  of  doing  these  things  {in  flagrante  delicto)  rather  than 
discovery  by  formal  trial.  Perverting  our  nation  {diastre- 
phonta  to  ethnos  hemon).  Present  active  participle  of  dias- 
trepho,  old  verb  to  turn  this  way  and  that,  distort,  disturb. 
In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  13  :io.  The  Sanhedrin  imply 
that  the  great  popularity  of  Jesus  was  seditious.  Forbid- 
ding to  give  tribute  to  Caesar,  {kbluonta  phorous  kaisari  di- 
donai).  Note  object  infinitive  didonai  after  the  participle 
kbluonta.  Literally,  hindering  giving  tribute  to  Caesar. 
This  was  a  flat  untruth.  Their  bright  young  students  had 
tried  desperately  to  get  Jesus  to  say  this  very  thing,  but 
they  had  failed  utterly  (Luke  20:25).  Saying  that  he  him- 
self is  Christ  a  king  {legonta  hauton  Christon  basilea  einai). 
Note  the  indirect  discourse  here  after  the  participle  legonta 
with  the  accusative  {hauton  where  auton  could  have  been 
used),  and  the  infinitive.  This  charge  is  true,  but  not  in  the 
sense  meant  by  them.  Jesus  did  claim  to  be  the  Christ  and 
the  king  of  the  kingdom  of  God.  But  the  Sanhedrin  wanted 
Pilate  to  think  that  he  set  himself  up  as  a  rival  to  Caesar. 

278 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  279 

Pilate  would  understand  little  from  the  word  "Christ,"  but 
"King"  was  a  different  matter.  He  was  compelled  to  take 
notice  of  this  charge  else  he  himself  would  be  accused  to 
Caesar  of  winking  at  such  a  claim  by  Jesus. 

3.  Thou  say  est  (su  legeis).  A  real  affirmative  as  in  22:70. 
The  Gospels  all  give  Pilate's  question  about  Jesus  asking  of 
the  Jews  in  precisely  the  same  words  (Mark  15:2;  Matt. 
27:11;  Luke  23:3;  John  18:33). 

4.  The  multitude  {tous  ochlous).  The  first  mention  of  them. 
It  is  now  after  daybreak.  The  procession  of  the  Sanhedrin 
would  draw  a  crowd  (Plummer)  and  some  may  have  come 
to  ask  for  the  release  of  a  prisoner  (Mark  15:8).  There  was 
need  of  haste  if  the  condemnation  went  through  before 
friends  of  Jesus  came.  I  find  no  fault  (ouden  heurisko  aition). 
In  the  N.T.  Luke  alone  uses  this  old  adjective  aitios  (Luke 
23 :4,  14,  22;  Acts  19:40)  except  Heb.  5:9.  It  means  one  who 
is  the  author,  the  cause  of  or  responsible  for  anything.  Luke 
does  not  give  the  explanation  of  this  sudden  decision  of 
Pilate  that  Jesus  is  innocent.  Evidently  he  held  a  careful 
examination  before  he  delivered  his  judgment  on  the  case. 
That  conversation  is  given  in  John  18:33-38.  Pilate  took 
Jesus  inside  the  palace  from  the  upper  gallery  (verse  33)  and 
then  came  out  and  rendered  his  decision  to  the  Sanhedrin 
(verse  38)  who  would  not  go  into  the  palace  of  Pilate  (John 
18:28). 

5.  But  they  were  the  more  urgent  (hoi  de  epischuon).  Im- 
perfect active  of  epischuo,  to  give  added  (epi)  strength 
(ischuo).  And  they  kept  insisting.  Evidently  Pilate  had 
taken  the  thing  too  lightly.  He  stirred  up  the  people  (anaseiei 
ton  laon).  This  compound  is  rare,  though  old  (Thucydides), 
to  shake  up  (back  and  forth).  This  is  a  more  vigorous  repe- 
tition of  the  first  charge  (verse  2,  "perverting  our  nation"). 
Beginning  from  Galilee  (arxamenos  apo  ies  Galilaias).  These 
very  words  occur  in  the  address  of  Peter  to  the  group  in  the

arxamenos  appears  also  in  Acts  i  :22.     Galilee  (Grote)  was 
the  mother  of  seditious  men  (see  Josephus). 

6.  A  Galilean  (Galilaios).  If  so,  here  was  a  way  out  for 
Herod  without  going  back  on  his  own  decision. 

7.  When  he  knew  {epignous).  Second  aorist  active  parti- 
ciple from  epiginoskb,  having  gained  full  {epi,  added  knowl- 
edge). Of  Herod's  jurisdiction  {ek  tes  exousias  Heroidou). 
Herod  was  naturally  jealous  of  any  encroachment  by  Pilate, 
the  Roman  Procurator  of  Judea.  So  here  was  a  chance  to 
respect  the  prerogative  {exousia)  of  Herod  and  get  rid  of  this 
troublesome  case  also.  Sent  him  up  (anepempsen).  First 
aorist  active  indicative  of  anapempb.  This  common  verb 
is  used  of  sending  back  as  in  verse  11  or  of  sending  up  to  a 
higher  court  as  of  Paul  to  Caesar  (Acts  25:21).  Who  himself 
also  was  (onta  kai  auton).  Being  also  himself  in  Jerusalem. 
Present  active  participle  of  eimi. 

8.  Was  exceeding  glad  {e  chare  lian).  Second  aorist  passive 
indicative  of  chairo,  ingressive  aorist,  became  glad.  Of  a 
long  time  {ex  hikanbn  chronbn).  For  this  idiom  see  8:27; 
20:9;  Acts  8:11).  He  hoped  (elpizen).  Imperfect  active.  He 
was  still  hoping.  He  had  long  ago  gotten  over  his  fright 
that  Jesus  was  John  the  Baptist  come  to  life  again  (9:7-9). 
Done  (ginomenon).  Present  middle  participle.  He  wanted 
to  see  a  miracle  happening  like  a  stunt  of  a  sleight-of-hand 
performer. 

9.  He  questioned  (eperbtd).  Imperfect  active,  kept  on 
questioning.  In  many  words  {en  logois  hikanois).  Same  use 
of  hikanos  as  in  verse  8. 

10.  Stood  {histekeisan).  Second  perfect  active  intransitive 
of  histemi  with  sense  of  imperfect.  They  stood  by  while 
Herod  quizzed  Jesus  and  when  he  refused  to  answer,  they 
broke  loose  with  their  accusations  like  a  pack  of  hounds  with 
full  voice  {eutonos,  adverb  from  adjective  eutonos,  from  eu, 
well,  and  teino,  to  stretch,  well  tuned).  Old  word,  but  in  the 
N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  18 128. 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  28 1 

11.  Set  him  at  nought  (exouthenesas).  First  aorist  active 
participle  from  exoutheneo,  to  count  as  nothing,  to  treat  with 
utter  contempt,  as  zero.  Arraying  him  in  gorgeous  apparel 
{peribalbn  estheta  lampran).  Second  aorist  active  participle 
of  periballo,  to  fling  around  one.  Lampran  is  brilliant,  shin- 
ing as  in  James  2 :2,  so  different  from  the  modest  dress  of  the 
Master.    This  was  part  of  the  shame. 

12.  For  before  they  were  at  enmity  between  themselves 
(proiiperchon  gar  en  echthrai  ontes  pros  heautous).  A  peri- 
phrastic imperfect  of  the  double  compound  proilperchb,  an 
old  verb,  to  exist  (huparcho)  previously  {pro-),  here  alone 
in  the  N.T.,  with  ontes  (participle  of  eimi)  added. 

13.  Called  together  (sunkalesamenos) .  First  aorist  middle 
participle  (to  himself).  Pilate  included  "the  people"  in  the 
hope  that  Jesus  might  have  some  friends  among  them. 

14.  As  one  that  perverteth  the  people  (hos  apostrephonta  ton 
laon).  Pilate  here  condenses  the  three  charges  in  verse  2  into 
one  (Plummer).  He  uses  a  more  common  compound  of 
strephb  here,  apostrepho,  to  turn  away  from,  to  seduce,  to  mis- 
lead, whereas  diastrephb  in  verse  2  has  more  the  notion  of 
disturbing  (turning  this  way  and  that).  Note  the  use  of  hos 
with  the  particle,  the  alleged  reason.  Pilate  understands 
the  charge  against  Jesus  to  be  that  he  is  a  revolutionary 
agitator  and  a  dangerous  rival  to  Caesar,  treason  in  plain 
words.  Having  examined  him  before  you  (enbpion  humbn 
anakrinas).  Right  before  your  eyes  I  have  given  him  a  care- 
ful examination  (ana)  up  and  down,  krino,  to  judge,  sift. 
Old  and  common  verb  in  the  general  sense  and  in  the  forensic 
sense  as  here  and  which  Luke  alone  has  in  the  N.T.  (Luke 
23:14;  4:9;  12:19;  28:18;  Acts  24:8)  except  I  Cor.  9:3. 
Whereof  (hon).  Attraction  of  the  relative  ha  to  the  case 
(genitive)  of  the  unexpressed  antecedent  touton. 

15.  No  nor  yet  (all'  oude).  But  not  even.  Hath  been  done 
by  him  (estin  pepragmenon  autoi).  Periphrastic  perfect 
passive  indicative  of  prasso,  common  verb,  to  do.    The  case 


282      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

of  autoi  can  be  regarded  as  either  the  dative  or  the  instru- 
mental (Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  534,  542). 

16.  Chastise  (paideusas).  First  aorist  active  participle  of 
paideuo,  to  train  a  child  (pais),  and  then,  as  a  part  of  the  train- 
ing, punishment.  Our  English  word  chasten  is  from  the 
Latin  castus,  pure,  chaste,  and  means  to  purify  (cf.  Heb.  12: 
6f.).  Perhaps  Pilate  may  have  split  a  hair  over  the  word  as 
Wycliff  puts  it:  "I  shall  deliver  him  amended."  But,  if 
Jesus  was  innocent,  Pilate  had  no  doubt  to  "chastise"  him 
to  satisfy  a  mob.  Verse  17  is  omitted  by  Westcott  and  Hort 
as  from  Mark  15:6  =  Matt.  27:15. 

18.  All  together  (panplethei) .  An  adverb  from  the  adjec- 
tive panplethes,  all  together.  Used  by  Dio  Cassius.  Only 
here  in  the  N.T.  Away  (aire).  Present  active  imperative, 
Take  him  on  away  and  keep  him  away  as  in  Acts  21:36; 
22:22,  of  Paul.  But  release  (apoluson)  is  first  aorist  active 
imperative,  do  it  now  and  at  once. 

19.  Insurrection  (stasin).  An  old  word  for  sedition,  stand- 
ing off,  the  very  charge  made  against  Jesus  (and  untrue). 
If  Jesus  had  raised  insurrection  against  Caesar,  these  ac- 
cusers would  have  rallied  to  his  standard.  And  for  murder 
(kai  phonon).  They  cared  nought  for  this.  In  fact,  the 
murderer  was  counted  a  hero  like  bandits  and  gangsters 
today  with  some  sentimentalists.  Was  cast  (en  bletheis). 
Periphrastic  aorist  passive  indicative  of  hallo,  a  quite  unusual 
form. 

2 1 .  But  they  shouted  (hoi  de  epephonoun) .  Imperfect  active 
of  epiphoneo,  to  call  to.  Old  verb  and  a  verb  pertinent  here. 
They  kept  on  yelling.  Crucify,  crucify  (staurou,  staurou). 
Present  active  imperative.  Go  on  with  the  crucifixion. 
Mark  15:13  has  stauroson  (first  aorist  active  imperative), 
do  it  now  and  be  done  with  it.  No  doubt  some  shouted  one 
form,  some  another. 

22.  Why,  what  evil?  (Ti  gar  kakon;).  Note  this  use  of 
gar  (explanatory  and  argumentative  combined). 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  283 

23.  But  they  were  instant  (hoi  de  epekeinto).  Imperfect 
middle  of  epikeimai,  an  old  verb  for  the  rush  and  swirl  of  a 
tempest.  With  loud  voices  (phonais  megalais).  Instrumental 
case.  Poor  Pilate  was  overwhelmed  by  this  tornado.  Pre- 
vailed (katischuon) .  Imperfect  active  of  katischuo  (see  Matt. 
16:18;  Luke  21 136).    The  tempest  Pilate  had  invited  (23  :i3). 

24.  Gave  sentence  (epekrinen).  Pronounced  the  final  sen- 
tence. The  usual  verb  for  the  final  decision.  Only  here  in 
the  N.T. 

25.  Whom  they  asked  for  (hon  eitounto).  Imperfect  middle, 
for  whom  they  had  been  asking  for  themselves.  Luke  repeats 
that  Barabbas  was  in  prison  "for  insurrection  and  murder." 
To  their  will  (toi  thelemati  auibn).  This  is  mob  law  by  the 
judge  who  surrenders  his  own  power  and  justice  to  the 
clamour  of  the  crowd. 

26.  They  laid  hold  (epilabomenoi) .  Second  aorist  middle 
participle  of  the  common  verb  epilambano.  The  soldiers 
had  no  scruples  about  taking  hold  of  any  one  of  themselves 
(middle  voice).  Mark  15:21  and  Luke  27:32  use  the  tech- 
nical word  for  this  process  aggareuo,  which  see  for  discussion 
and  also  about  Cyrene.  Laid  on  him  (epethekan).  K  first 
aorist  of  epitithemi.  To  bear  it  (pherein).  Present  infinitive, 
to  go  on  bearing. 

27.  Followed  (ekolouthei).  Imperfect  active,  was  follow- 
ing. Verses  27  to  32  are  peculiar  to  Luke.  Bewailed  (ekop- 
tonto).  Imperfect  middle  of  kopto,  to  cut,  smite,  old  and 
common  verb.  Direct  middle,  they  were  smiting  themselves 
on  the  breast.  "In  the  Gospels  there  is  no  instance  of  a 
woman  being  hostile  to  Christ"  (Plummer).  Luke's  Gospel 
is  appropriately  called  the  Gospel  of  Womanhood  (1 :39— 56; 
2:36-38;  7:n-i5;  37"S°;  8:1-3;  10:38-42;  11:27;  13:11-16). 
Lamented  (ethrenoun).  Imperfect  active  of  threneo,  old  verb 
from  threomai,  to  cry  aloud,  lament. 

28.  Turning  (strapheis).  Luke  is  fond  of  this  second  aorist 
passive  participle  of  strepho  (7:9,  44,  55;  10:23).    If  he  had 


284      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

been  still  carrying  the  Cross,  he  could  not  have  made  this 
dramatic  gesture.  Weep  not  (me  klaiete).  Present  active 
imperative  with  me,  Stop  weeping. 

29.  Blessed  (makariai).  A  beatitude  to  the  barren,  the 
opposite  of  the  hopes  of  Jewish  mothers.  Childless  women 
are  commiserated  (1:25,  36).  To  the  hills  (tois  bounois). 
A  Cyrenaic  word.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  3  :$.  Quota- 
tion from  Hosea  10:8. 

31.  In  the  green  tree  (en  hugrbi  xuloi).  Green  wood  is  hard 
to  burn  and  so  is  used  for  the  innocent.  In  the  dry  (en  tbi 
xerox).  Dry  wood  kindles  easily  and  is  a  symbol  for  the 
guilty.  This  common  proverb  has  various  applications. 
Here  the  point  is  that  if  they  can  put  Jesus  to  death,  being 
who  he  is,  what  will  happen  to  Jerusalem  when  its  day  of 
judgment  comes?  What  shall  be  done  (ti  genetai).  Delibera- 
tive subjunctive. 

32.  Were  led  (egonto) .  Imperfect  passive  of  ago,  were  being 
led.  Malefactors  (kakourgoi).  Evil  (kakon),  doers  (work, 
ergon).  Old  word,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  in  this  passage 
(32,  33,  39)  and  II  Tim.  2:9.  Luke  does  not  call  them  "rob- 
bers "  like  Mark  1 5  \2j  =  Matt.  27  38,  44.  To  be  put  to  death 
(anairethenai).  First  aorist  passive  infinitive  of  anaireb,  old 
verb,  to  take  up,  to  take  away,  to  kill. 

33.  The  skull  (to  kr anion).  Probably  because  it  looked 
like  a  skull.  See  on  Matt.  27:33  =Mark  15:22.  There  they 
crucified  him  (ekei  estaurbsan).  There  between  the  two  rob- 
bers and  on  the  very  cross  on  which  Barabbas,  the  leader 
of  the  robber  band,  was  to  have  been  crucified.  One  (hon 
men),  the  other  (hon  de).  Common  idiom  of  contrast  with 
this  old  demonstrative  hos  and  men  and  de. 

34.  Father  forgive  them  (Pater,  aphes  autois).  Second  aorist 
active  imperative  of  aphiemi,  with  dative  case.  Some  of  the 
oldest  and  best  documents  do  not  contain  this  verse,  and  yet, 
while  it  is  not  certain  that  it  is  a  part  of  Luke's  Gospel,  it  is 
certain  that  Jesus  spoke  these  words,  for  they  are  utterly 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  285 

unlike  any  one  else.  Jesus  evidently  is  praying  for  the  Ro- 
man soldiers,  who  were  only  obeying,  but  not  for  the  Sanhe- 
drin.  Cast  lots  (ebalon  kleron).  Second  aorist  active  indica- 
tive of  hallo.  See  Mark  15:24;  Matt.  27:35.  John  19:23^ 
shows  how  the  lot  was  cast  for  the  seamless  garment,  the 
four  soldiers  dividing  the  other  garments. 

35.  The  people  stood  beholding  (histekei).  Past  perfect 
active  of  hisiemi,  intransitive  and  like  imperfect.  A  graphic 
picture  of  the  dazed  multitude,  some  of  whom  may  have  been 
in  the  Triumphal  Entry  on  Sunday  morning.  Scoffed 
(exemukterizon) .  Imperfect  active,  perhaps  inchoative, 
began  to  turn  up  (out,  ex)  at  the  dying  Christ.  The  language 
comes  from  Psalm  22:7.  The  Christ  of  God  (ho  Christos  ton 
theou).  He  had  claimed  to  be  just  this  (22:67,  7°)-  The 
sarcastic  sneer  (he  saved  others;  let  him  save  others,  for  him- 
self he  cannot  save)  is  in  Mark  15:31;  Matt.  27:42.  Luke 
alone  gives  the  contemptuous  use  of  houtos  (this  fellow)  and 
the  fling  in  "the  elect"  (ho  eklektos).  These  rulers  were 
having  their  day  at  last. 

36.  Mocked  (enepaixan) .  Even  the  soldiers  yielded  to  the 
spell  and  acted  like  boys  in  their  jeers.  Aorist  tense  here  and 
different  verb  also  from  that  used  of  the  rulers.  They  were 
not  so  bitter  and  persistent. 

37.  //  (ei).  Condition  of  the  first  class  as  is  text  in  verse 
35  used  by  the  rulers.  The  soldiers  pick  out  "the  king  of  the 
Jews"  as  the  point  of  their  sneer,  the  point  on  which  Jesus 
was  condemned.  But  both  soldiers  and  rulers  fail  to  under- 
stand that  Jesus  could  not  save  himself  if  he  was  to  save 
others. 

38.  A  superscription  (epigraph?).  Mark  15:26  has  "the 
superscription  of  his  accusation"  Matt.  27:37,  "his  accusa- 
tion, "  John  19:19  "a  title. "  But  they  all  refer  to  the  charge 
written  at  the  top  on  the  cross  giving,  as  was  the  custom, 
the  accusation  on  which  the  criminal  was  condemned,  with 
his  name  and  residence.    Put  all  the  reports  together  and  we 


286      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

have:  This  is  Jesus  of  Nazareth  the  King  of  the  Jews.  This 
full  title  appeared  in  Latin  for  law,  in  Aramaic  for  the  Jews, 
in  Greek  for  everybody  (John   19:20). 

39.  Railed  (eblasphemei) .  Imperfect  active,  implying 
that  he  kept  it  up.  His  question  formally  calls  for  an  affirma- 
tive answer  (ouchi),  but  the  ridicule  is  in  his  own  answer: 
"Save  thyself  and  us."  It  was  on  a  level  with  an  effort  to 
break  prison.  Luke  alone  gives  this  incident  (39-43),  though 
Mark  15:32  and  Matt  27:44  allude  to  it. 

40.  Rebuking  (epitimon).  From  what  Mark  and  Matthew 
say  both  robbers  sneered  at  Jesus  at  first,  but  this  one  came 
to  himself  and  turned  on  his  fellow  robber  in  a  rage.  Dost 
thou  not  even  fear  God?  (Oude  phobei  ton  theon;).  Oude  here 
goes  with  the  verb.  Phobei  (second  person  singular  present 
indicative  middle  of  phobeomai.  Both  of  you  will  soon  appear 
before  God.  Jesus  has  nothing  to  answer  for  and  you  have 
added  this  to  your  other  sins. 

41.  Nothing  amiss  (ouden  atopon).  Nothing  out  of  place 
{a  privative,  topos,  place).  Old  word,  three  times  in  the  N.T. 
(Luke  23:44;  Acts  28:6;  II  Thess.  3:2).  This  can  only  mean 
that  this  robber  accepts  the  claims  of  Jesus  to  be  true.  He  is 
dying  for  claiming  to  be  Messiah,  as  he  is. 

42.  In  thy  kingdom  (eis  ten  basileian  sou,  text  of  Westcott 
and  Hort  or  en  tei  basileidi  sou,  margin).  Probably  no 
difference  in  sense  is  to  be  found,  for  eis  and  en  are  essentially 
the  same  preposition.  He  refers  to  the  Messianic  rule  of 
Jesus  and  begs  that  Jesus  will  remember  him.  It  is  not 
clear  whether  he  hopes  for  immediate  blessing  or  only  at  the 
judgment. 

43.  Today  shalt  thou  be  with  me  in  Paradise  (Semeron  met1 
emou  esei  en  tbi  paradeisbi).  However  crude  may  have  been 
the  robber's  Messianic  ideas  Jesus  clears  the  path  for  him. 
He  promises  him  immediate  and  conscious  fellowship  after 
death  with  Christ  in  Paradise  which  is  a  Persian  word  and 
is  used  here  not  for  any  supposed  intermediate  state,  but  the 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  287 

very  bliss  of  heaven  itself.  This  Persian  word  was  used  for 
an  enclosed  park  or  pleasure  ground  (so  Xenophon).  The 
word  occurs  in  two  other  passages  in  the  N.T.  (II  Cor.  12:4; 
Rev.  2:7),  in  both  of  which  the  reference  is  plainly  to  heaven. 
Some  Jews  did  use  the  word  for  the  abode  of  the  pious  dead 
till  the  resurrection,  interpreting  "Abraham's  bosom" 
(Luke  i6:22f.)  in  this  sense  also.  But  the  evidence  for  such 
an  intermediate  state  is  too  weak  to  warrant  belief  in  it. 

45.  The  sun's  light  failing  {tou  heliou  ekleipontos) .  Geni- 
tive absolute  of  the  present  active  participle  of  ekleipo,  an 
old  verb,  to  leave  out,  omit,  pass  by,  to  fail,  to  die.  The 
word  was  used  also  of  the  eclipse  of  the  sun  or  moon.  But 
this  was  impossible  at  this  time  because  the  moon  was  full 
at  the  passover.  Hence  many  documents  change  this  correct 
text  to  "the  sun  was  darkened"  {eskotisthe  ho  helios)  to 
obviate  the  difficulty  about  the  technical  eclipse.  But  the 
sun  can  be  darkened  in  other  ways.  In  a  London  fog  at  noon 
the  street  lights  are  often  turned  on.  The  Revised  Version 
translates  it  correctly,  "the  sun's  light  failing."  Leave  the 
darkness  unexplained.  In  the  midst  {meson).  In  the  middle. 
Mark  15:38  and  Matt.  27:51  have  "in  two"  {eis  duo). 

46.  Father  {Pater).  Jesus  dies  with  the  words  of  Psalm 
31 :5  on  his  lips.  Gave  up  the  ghost  {exepneusen).  First  aorist 
active  indicative  of  ekpneo,  to  breathe  out,  to  expire,  old 
word,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Mark  15:37,  39.  There 
is  no  special  reason  for  retaining  "ghost"  in  the  English  as 
both  Matt.  27:50  (yielded  up  his  spirit,  apheken  to  pneumd) 
and  John  19:30  (gave  up  his  spirit,  paredbken  to  pneuma) 
use  pneuma  which  is  the  root  of  ekpneo,  the  verb  in  Mark  and 
Luke. 

47.  Glorified  {edoxazen).  Imperfect  active.  Began  to 
glorify  (inchoative)  or  kept  on  glorifying. 

48.  Certainly  {ontbs).  Really,  old  adverb  from  the  parti- 
ciple on  from  eimi,  to  be.  Used  also  in  24:34  of  the  resur- 
rection of  Jesus.     A  righteous  man  {dikaios).     Mark  15:39 


288      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

(Matt.  27:54)  which  see,  represents  the  centurion  as  saying 
theou  huios  (God's  Son)  which  may  mean  to  him  little  more 
than  "righteous  man."  That  came  together  (sunparageno- 
menoi).  Double  compound  (sun,  together,  para,  along),  that 
came  along  together.  To  this  sight  (epi  ten  thebrian  tauten). 
This  spectacle  (theorian  from  thebreb,  verse  35).  Returned

slowly  wending  their  way  back  to  the  city  from  this  Tragedy 
of  the  Ages  which  they  had  witnessed  in  awe. 

49.  Stood  afar  off  (histekeisan  apo  makrothen).  Same  verb 
as  in  verse  35.  Melancholy  picture  of  the  inner  circle  of  the 
acquaintances  of  Jesus  and  the  faithful  band  of  women  from 
Galilee.  Seeing  these  things  (horbsai  tauta).  And  helpless

51.  He  had  not  consented  to  their  counsel  and  deed  (houtos 
ouk  en  sunkatatetheimenos  tei  boulei  kai  tei  praxei  autbn). 
This  parenthesis  is  given  by  Luke  alone  and  explains  that, 
though  a  councillor  (bouleutes,  Mark  5:43)  he  had  not  agreed 
to  the  vote  of  the  Sanhedrin.  It  is  fairly  certain  that  both 
Joseph  and  Nicodemus  were  suspected  of  sympathy  with 
Jesus  and  so  were  not  invited  to  the  trial  of  Jesus.  Was  look- 
ing for  (prosedecheto).  Imperfect  middle.  Mark  15:43  has 
the  periphrastic  imperfect  (en  prosdechomenos) . 

52.  Asked  for  (eitesato).  First  aorist  middle  (indirect) 
indicative  as  in  Mark  15:43=  Matt.  27:58.  The  middle 
voice  shows  that  Joseph  of  Arimathea  asked  the  body  of 
Jesus  as  a  personal  favour. 

53.  Took  it  down  (kathelbn).  Second  aorist  active  parti- 
ciple of  kathaireb  as  in  Mark  15:46.  Wrapped  (enetulixen) , 
as  in  Matt.  27:59  where  Mark  15:46  has  eneilesen  (wound), 
which  see.  John  19:40  has  "bound"  (edesan).  See  Matt, 
and  Mark  also  for  the  linen  cloth  (sindoni).  Hewn  in  stone 
(laxeutbi).  From  laxeub  (las,  a  stone,  xeb,  to  polish).  In  the 
LXX  and  here  only  in  the  N.T.     Nowhere  else  so  far  as 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  289 

known.  See  the  usual  Greek  verb  latomeb  in  Mark  15:46  = 
Matt.  27:60.  Where  never  man  had  yet  lain  (hou  ouk  en 
oudeis  oupo  keimenos).  Triple  negative  and  periphrastic 
past  perfect  passive  in  sense  (keimai),  though  periphrastic 
imperfect  passive  in  form.  Same  item  in  John  19:40  who 
uses  en  tetheimenos  (periphrastic  past  perfect  passive  in  form). 

54.  The  day  of  the  Preparation  (hemera  paraskeues).  The 
technical  Jewish  phrase  for  the  day  before  the  sabbath  for 
which  see  discussion  on  Matt.  27:62.  Drew  on  (epephosken). 
Imperfect  active,  began  to  dawn  or  give  light.  However,  it 
was  sundown,  not  sunrise  when  the  Jewish  sabbath  (twenty- 
four-hour  day)  began.  The  confusion  is  to  us,  not  to  the 
Jews  or  the  readers  of  the  Greek  New  Testament.  Luke  is 
not  speaking  of  the  twelve-hour  day  which  began  with  sun- 
rise, but  the  twenty-four-hour  day  which  began  with  sunset. 

55.  Had  come  with  him  (esan  suneleluthuiai) .  Periphrastic 
past  perfect  active  of  sunerchomai.  Followed  after  {kata- 
kolouthesasai).  Aorist  active  participle  of  katakoloutheo, 
an  old  verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  16:17.  It ls 
possible  that  they  followed  after  Joseph  and  Nicodemus  so 
that  they  "beheld  the  tomb,"  {etheasanto  to  mnemeion),  and 
also  "how  his  body  was  laid"  (hos  etethe  to  soma  autou). 
First  aorist  passive  indicative  of  tithemi.  They  may  in  fact, 
have  witnessed  the  silent  burial  from  a  distance.  The  Syriac 
Sinaitic  and  the  Syriac  Curetonian  give  it  thus:  "and  the 
women,  who  came  with  Him  from  Galilee  went  to  the  sep- 
ulchre in  their  footsteps,  and  saw  the  body  when  they  had 
brought  it  in  there."  At  any  rate  the  women  saw  "that" 
and  "how"  the  body  of  Jesus  was  laid  in  this  new  tomb  of 
Joseph  in  the  rocks. 

56.  On  the  sabbath  they  rested  {to  sabbaton  hesuchasan). 
They  returned  and  prepared  spices  before  the  sabbath  be- 
gan. Then  they  rested  all  during  the  sabbath  (accusative  of 
extent  of  time,  to  sabbaton). 


CHAPTER  XXIV 

1.  At  early  dawn  (orthrou  batheos).  Genitive  of  time.  Lit- 
erally, at  deep  dawn.  The  adjective  bathus  (deep)  was  often 
used  of  time.  This  very  idiom  occurs  in  Aristophanes,  Plato, 
et  cetera.  John  20:1  adds  "  while  it  was  yet  dark."  That  is, 
when  they  started,  for  the  sun  was  risen  when  they  arrived 
(Mark  16:2).  Which  they  had  prepared  {ha  hetoimasan). 
Mark  16:1  notes  that  they  bought  other  spices  after  the 
sabbath  was  over  besides  those  which  they  already  had 
(Luke  23:56). 

2.  Rolled  away  (apokekulismenon) .  Perfect  passive  parti- 
ciple of  apokulio,  late  verb  and  in  the  N.T.  only  in  this  con- 
text (Mark  16:3;  Matt.  28:2)  while  John  20:1  has  ermenon 
(taken  away). 

3.  Of  the  Lord  Jesus  (ton  kuriou  Iesou).  The  Western 
family  of  documents  does  not  have  these  words  and  Westcott 
and  Hort  bracket  them  as  Western  non-interpolations. 
There  are  numerous  instances  of  this  shorter  Western  text 
in  this  chapter.  For  a  discussion  of  the  subject  see  my 
Introduction  to  the  Textual  Criticism  of  the  New  Testament, 
pp.  225-237.  This  precise  combination  (the  Lord  Jesus)  is 
common  in  the  Acts,  but  nowhere  else  in  the  Gospels. 

4.  While  they  were  perplexed  thereabout  (en  ibi  aporeisthai 
autas  peri  toutou).  Luke's  common  Hebraistic  idiom,  en 
with  the  articular  infinitive  (present  passive  aporeisthai  from 
aporeo,  to  lose  one's  way)  and  the  accusative  of  general  refer- 
ence. Two  men  (andres  duo) .  Men,  not  women.  Mark  16:5 
speaks  of  a  young  man  (neaniskon)  while  Matt.  28:5  has 
"an  angel."  We  need  not  try  to  reconcile  these  varying  ac- 
counts which  agree  in  the  main  thing.  The  angel  looked  like 
a  man  and  some  remembered  two.    In  verse  23  Cleopas  and 

290 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  291 

his  companion  call  them  "angels."  Stood  by  {epestesan). 
Second  aorist  active  indicative  of  ephistemi.  This  common 
verb  usually  means  to  step  up  suddenly,  to  burst  upon  one. 
In  dazzling  apparel  {en  estheti  astraptousei).  This  is  the  cor- 
rect text.  This  common  simplex  verb  occurs  only  twice  in 
the  N.T.,  here  and  Luke  17:24  (the  Transfiguration).  It  has 
the  same  root  as  astrape  (lightning).  The  "men"  had  the 
garments  of  "angels." 

5.  As  they  were  affrighted  {emphobbn  genomenon  autbn). 
Genitive  absolute  with  second  aorist  middle  of  ginomai,  to 
become.  Hence,  when  they  became  affrighted.  They  had 
utterly  forgotten  the  prediction  of  Jesus  that  he  would  rise 
on  the  third  day. 

6.  He  is  not  here,  but  is  risen  (ouk  estin  hode,  alia  egerthe). 
Another  Western  non-interpolation  according  to  Westcott 
and  Hort.  The  words  are  genuine  at  any  rate  in  Mark  16:6; 
Matt.  28  7.  The  third  day  rise  again  [tei  triiei  hemerdi  anas- 
ienai).  See  9:22;  18:32,  33  where  Jesus  plainly  foretold  this 
fact.  And  yet  they  had  forgotten  it,  for  it  ran  counter  to  all 
their  ideas  and  hopes. 

9.  From  the  tomb  (apo  tou  mnemeiou).  Some  documents 
omit  these  words.  This  word  for  tomb  is  like  our  "memo- 
rial" from  mimnesko,  to  remind.  Told  (apeggeilan).  It 
was  a  wonderful  proclamation.  Luke  does  not  separate  the 
story  of  Mary  Magdalene  from  that  of  the  other  women  as 
John  does  (20:2-18). 

11.  As  idle  talk  (hos  leros).  Old  word  for  nonsense,  only 
here  in  the  N.T.  Medical  writers  used  it  for  the  wild  talk 
of  those  in  delirium  or  hysteria.  Disbelieved  (epistoun).  Im- 
perfect active  of  apisteo,  old  verb  from  apistos,  without  con- 
fidence or  faith  in.  They  kept  on  distrusting  the  story  of  the 
women. 

12.  This  entire  verse  is  a  Western  non-interpolation. 
This  incident  is  given  in  complete  form  in  John  18:2-10 
and  most  of  the  words  in  this  verse  are  ther^  also.    It  is  of 


292      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

a  piece  with  many  items  in  this  chapter  about  which  it  is 
not  easy  to  reach  a  final  conclusion.  Stooping  and  looking 
in  (parakupsas).  First  aorist  active  participle  of  parakupto, 
to  stoop  besides  and  peer  into.  Old  verb  used  also  in  John 
20:5,  11;  James  1:25;  I  Pet.  1:12.  By  themselves  (mona). 
Without  the  body.  To  his  home  {pros  hauton).  Literally, 
" to  himself." 

13.  Were  going  (esan  poreuomenoi).  Periphrastic  im- 
perfect middle  of  poreuomai.  Sixty  stadia  {stadious  hexe- 
konta).    About  seven  miles. 

14.  They  communed  {hbmiloun).  Imperfect  active  of 
homileo,  old  and  common  verb  (from  homilos,  in  company 
with).  In  the  N.T.  only  here  (and  verse  15)  and  Acts  20:11; 
24:26.  Our  word  homiletics  is  derived  from  this  word  for 
preaching  was  at  first  largely  conversational  in  style  and 
not  declamatory. 

15.  While  they  communed  and  questioned  together  {en  toi 
homilein  autous  kai  sunzetein).  Same  idiom  as  in  verse  14, 
which  see.  Note  sunzetein;  each  questioned  the  other. 
Jesus  himself  {autos  Iesous).  In  actual  person.  Went  with 
them  {suneporeueto  autois).  Imperfect  middle,  was  going 
along  with  them. 

16.  Were  holden  that  they  should  not  know  him  {ekratounto 
tou  me  epignonai  auton).  Imperfect  passive  of  krated,  con- 
tinued being  held,  with  the  ablative  case  of  the  articular 
infinitive,  "from  recognizing  him,"  from  knowing  him  fully 
{epi-gnonai,  ingressive  aorist  of  epiginosko).  The  me  is  a 
redundant  negative  after  the  negative  idea  in  ekratounto. 

17.  That  you  have  with  another  {hous  antiballete  pros  alle- 
lous).  Anti-ballo  is  an  old  verb  and  means  to  throw  in  turn, 
back  and  forth  like  a  ball,  from  one  to  another,  a  beautiful 
picture  of  conversation  as  a  game  of  words.  Only  here  in 
the  N.T.  They  stood  still  {estathesan).  First  aorist  passive  of 
histemi,  intransitive.  They  stopped.  Looking  sad  {skuthro- 
poi).    This  is  the  correct  text.     It  is  an  old  adjective  from 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  293 

skuthros,  gloomy  and  ops,  countenance.    Only  here  in  the 
N.T. 

18.  Dost  thou  alone  sojourn?  (su  monos  paroikeis;). 
Monos  is  predicate  adjective.  "Hast  thou  been  dwelling 
alone  (all  by  thyself)?"  And  not  know?  {kai  ouk  egnos;). 
Second  aorist  active  indicative  and  difficult  to  put  into 
English  as  the  aorist  often  is.  The  verb  paroikeo  means  to 
dwell  beside  one,  then  as  a  stranger  like  paroikoi  (Eph.  2:19). 
In  Jerusalem  everybody  was  talking  about  Jesus. 

21.  But  we  hoped  {Kernels  de  elpizomen).  Imperfect  active, 
we  were  hoping.  Note  emphasis  in  hemeis  (we).  Redeem 
(lutrousthai) .  From  the  bondage  of  Rome,  no  doubt.  Yea 
and  beside  all  this  {alia  ge  kai  sun  pasin  toutois).  Particles 
pile  up  to  express  their  emotions.  Yea  {alia  here  affirmative, 
as  in  verse  22,  not  adversative)  at  least  {ge)  also  {kai)  to- 
gether with  all  these  things  {sun  pasin  toutois).  Like  Pelion 
on  Ossa  with  them  in  their  perplexity.  Now  the  third  day 
{triten  tauten  hemeran  agei).  A  difficult  idiom  for  the  Eng- 
lish. "One  is  keeping  this  a  third  day."  And  he  is  still 
dead  and  we  are  still  without  hope. 

22.  Amazed  us  {exestesan  hemas).  First  aorist  active 
(transitive)  indicative  with  accusative  hemas  of  existemi. 
The  second  aorist  active  is  intransitive.  Early  {orthrinai). 
A  poetic  and  late  form  for  orthrios.  In  the  N.T.  only  here 
and  Rev.  24:22.  Predicate  adjective  agreeing  with  the 
women. 

23.  Had  seen  (heorakenai) .  Perfect  active  infinitive  in 
indirect  assertion  after  legousai.  Same  construction  for 
zein  after  legousin.  But  all  this  was  too  indirect  and  un- 
certain (women  and  angels)  for  Cleopas  and  his  companion. 

25.  Foolish  men  (anoetoi).  Literally  without  sense  {nous), 
not  understanding.  Common  word.  Slow  of  heart  {bradeis 
iei  kardidi).  Slow  in  heart  (locative  case).  Old  word  for 
one  dull,  slow  to  comprehend  or  to  act.  All  that  {pasin 
hois).     Relative  attracted  from  the  accusative  ha  to  the 


294      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

case  of  the  antecedent  pdsin   (dative).     They  could  only 
understand  part  of  the  prophecies,  not  all. 

26.  Behooved  it  not?  (ouchi  edei;).  Was  it  not  necessary? 
The  very  things  about  the  death  of  Jesus  that  disturbed 
them  so  were  the  strongest  proof  that  he  was  the  Messiah 
of  the  Old  Testament. 

27.  Interpreted  (diermeneusen) .  First  aorist  active  (con- 
stative  aorist)  indicative  of  diermeneub  (Margin  has  the  im- 
perfect diermeneuen) ,  intensive  compound  (did)  oihermeneub, 
the  old  verb  to  interpret  from  hermeneus,  interpreter,  and 
that  from  Hermes,  the  messenger  of  the  gods  as  the  people  of 
Lystra  took  Paul  to  be  (Acts  14:12).  But  what  wonderful 
exegesis  the  two  disciples  were  now  hearing!  Concerning 
himself  (peri  heauton).  Jesus  found  himself  in  the  Old  Testa- 
ment, a  thing  that  some  modern  scholars  do  not  seem  able 
to  do. 

28.  Made  as  though  (prosepoiesato).  First  aorist  active 
middle  (Some  MSS.  have  prosepoieito  imperfect)  indicative 
of  prospoieb,  old  verb  to  conform  oneself  to,  to  pretend. 
Only  here  in  the  N.T.  Of  course  he  would  have  gone  on  if  the 
disciples  had  not  urged  him  to  stay. 

29.  Constrained  (parebiasanto).  Strong  verb  parabiazo- 
mai,  to  compel  by  use  of  force  (Polybius  and  LXX).  In 
the  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  16:15.  It  was  nere  compulsion 
of  courteous  words.  Is  far  spent  (kekliken).  Perfect  active 
indicative  of  klinb.    The  day  "has  turned"  toward  setting. 

30.  When  he  had  sat  down  (en  tbi  kataklithenai  auton). 
Luke's  common  idiom  as  in  verses  4  and  15.  Note  first  aorist 
passive  infinitive  (on  the  reclining  as  to  him).  Gave  (epedi- 
dou).  Imperfect,  inchoative  idea,  began  to  give  to  them, 
in  contrast  with  the  preceding  aorist  (punctiliar)  participles. 

31.  Were  opened  (dienoichthesan).  Ingressive  first  aorist 
passive  indicative  of  dianoigb.  Knew  (epegnbsan).  Effec- 
tive first  aorist  active  indicative  fully  recognized  him.  Same 
word  in  verse   16.     Vanished  (aphantos  egeneto).     Became 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  295 

invisible  or  unmanifested.     Aphantos  from  a  privative  and 
phainomai,  to  appear.    Old  word,  only  here  in  the  N.T. 

32.  Was  not  our  heart  burning?  {Ouchi  he  kardia  hembn 
kaiomene  en;).  Periphrastic  imperfect  middle.  Spake  (ela- 
lei).  Imperfect  active,  was  speaking.  This  common  verb 
laleo  is  onomatopoetic,  to  utter  a  sound,  la-la  and  was  used 
of  birds,  children  chattering,  and  then  for  conversation,  for 
preaching,  for  any  public  speech.  Opened  (dienoigen).  Im- 
perfect active  indicative  of  the  same  verb  used  of  the  eyes 
in  verse  31. 

33.  That  very  hour  (autei  iei  horai).  Locative  case  and 
common  Lukan  idiom,  at  the  hour  itself.  They  could  not 
wait.  Gathered  (ethroismenous) .  Perfect  passive  participle 
of  athroizo,  old  verb  from  athroos  (copulative  a  and  throos, 
crowd).    Only  here  in  the  N.T. 

34.  Saying  (legontas).  Accusative  present  active  partici- 
ple agreeing  with  "the  eleven  and  those  with  them"  in 
verse  33.  Indeed  (ontos).  Really,  because  "he  has  appeared 
to  Simon"  (opthe  Simoni).  First  aorist  passive  indicative 
of  horao.  This  is  the  crucial  evidence  that  turned  the  scales 
with  the  disciples  and  explains  "indeed."  Paul  also  men- 
tions it  (I  Cor.  15:5). 

35.  Rehearsed  (exegounto).  Imperfect  middle  indicative 
of  exegeomai,  verb  to  lead  out,  to  rehearse.  Our  word  exege- 
sis comes  from  this  verb.  Their  story  was  now  confirmatory, 
not  revolutionary.  The  women  were  right  then  after  all. 
Of  them  (autois).  To  them,  dative  case.  They  did  not  rec- 
ognize Jesus  in  his  exegesis,  but  did  in  the  breaking  of  bread. 
One  is  reminded  of  that  saying  in  the  Logia  of  Jesus:  "Raise 
the  stone  and  there  thou  shalt  find  me,  cleave  the  wood  and 
there  am  I." 

36.  He  himself  stood  {autos  este).  He  himself  stepped  and 
stood.    Some  documents  do  not  have  "Peace  be  unto  you." 

37.  Terrified  (ptoethentes).  First  aorist  passive  participle 
of  ptoeo,  old  verb  and  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  21:9 


296      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

which  see.  Affrighted  {emphoboi  genomenoi).  Late  adjective 
from  en  and  phobos  (fear).  Both  these  terms  of  fear  are 
strong.  Supposed  (edokoun).  Imperfect  active  of  dokeo, 
kept  on  thinking  so. 

38.  Why  are  ye  troubled?  (ti  tetaragmenoi  este;).  Peri- 
phrastic perfect  passive  indicative  of  tarasso,  old  verb,  to 
agitate,  to  stir  up,  to  get  excited. 

39.  Myself  (autos).  Jesus  is  patient  with  his  proof.  They 
were  convinced  before  he  came  into  the  room,  but  that 
psychological  shock  had  unnerved  them  all.  Handle  (psela- 
phesate).  This  very  word  is  used  in  I  John  1  :i  as  proof  of  the 
actual  human  body  of  Jesus.  It  is  an  old  verb  for  touching 
with  the  hand.  Flesh  and  bones  (sarka  kai  ostea).  At  least 
this  proves  that  he  is  not  just  a  ghost  and  that  Jesus  had  a 
real  human  body  against  the  Docetic  Gnostics  who  denied  it. 
But  clearly  we  are  not  to  understand  that  our  resurrection 
bodies  will  have  "  flesh  and  bones. "  Jesus  was  in  a  transition 
state  and  had  not  yet  been  glorified.  The  mystery  remains 
unsolved,  but  it  was  proof  to  the  disciples  of  the  identity  of 
the  Risen  Christ  with  Jesus  of  Nazareth. 

40.  Another  Weston  non-interpolation  according  to  West- 
cott  and  Hort.    It  is  genuine  in  John  20:20. 

41.  Disbelieved  for  joy  (apistountbn  auibn  apo  tes  charas). 
Genitive  absolute  and  a  quite  understandable  attitude. 
They  were  slowly  reconvinced,  but  it  was  after  all  too  good  to 
be  true.  Anything  to  eat  (brbsimon).  Only  here  in  the  N.T., 
though  an  old  word  from  bibrbskb,  to  eat. 

42.  A  piece  of  broiled  fish  (ichthuos  optou  meros).  Optos  is 
a  verbal  from  optab,  to  cook,  to  roast,  to  broil.  Common 
word,  but  only  here  in  the  N.T.  The  best  old  documents 
omit  "and  a  honeycomb"  (kai  apo  melissiou  keriou). 

44.  While  I  was  yet  with  you  (eti  on  sun  humin).  Literally, 
Being  yet  with  you.  The  participle  on  takes  the  time  of  the 
principal  verb. 

45.  Opened  he  their  mind  (dienoixen  auibn  ton  noun).    The 


GOSPEL  ACCORDING  TO  LUKE  297 

same  verb  as  that  in  verses  31  and  32  about  the  eyes  and  the 
Scriptures.  Jesus  had  all  these  years  been  trying  to  open 
their  minds  that  they  might  understand  the  Scriptures  about 
the  Messiah  and  now  at  last  he  makes  one  more  effort  in 
the  light  of  the  Cross  and  the  Resurrection.  They  can  now 
see  better  the  will  and  way  of  God,  but  they  will  still  need 
the  power  of  the  Holy  Spirit  before  they  will  fully  know  the 
mind  of  Christ. 

46.  It  is  written  {gegraptai).  Perfect  passive  indicative  of 
grapho,  to  write,  the  usual  phrase  for  quoting  Scripture. 
Jesus  now  finds  in  the  Old  Testament  his  suffering,  his  res- 
urrection, and  the  preaching  of  repentance  and  forgiveness 
of  sins  to  all  nations.  Note  the  infinitives  pathein,  anastenai, 
keruchthenai. 

47.  Beginning  {arxamenoi).  Aorist  middle  participle  of 
archo,  but  the  nominative  plural  with  no  syntactical  connec-

yourselves  power  from  on  high  as  a  garment.  They  are  to 
wait  till  this  experience  comes  to  them.  This  is  "the  promise 
of  the  Father."  It  is  an  old  metaphor  in  Homer,  Aris-

tions  that  may  be  genuine  or  not.  With  great  joy  (meta  char  as 
me  gales).  Now  that  the  Ascension  has  come  they  are  no 
longer  in  despair.  Joy  becomes  the  note  of  victory  as  it  is 
today.  No  other  note  can  win  victories  for  Christ.  The  bells 
rang  in  heaven  to  greet  the  return  of  Jesus  there,  bat  he  set 
the  carillon  of  joy  to  ringing  on  earth  in  human  hearts  in  all 
lands  and  for  all  time. 


A.  T.  Robertson 

A.  T.  Robertson,  professor  of  inter- 
pretation of  the  Greek  New  Testament 
at  Southern  Baptist  Theological  Semi- 
nary for  nearly  a  half  century,  was  one 
of  the  most  brilliant  and  popular  Bible 
scholars  of  his  day. 

A  world-famous  authority  on  the 
Greek  New  Testament,  Dr.  Robertson 
was  a  powerful  preacher  and  lecturer, 
and  a  prolific  writer  with  forty-five  vol- 
umes on  both  popular  and  profound 
subjects  to  his  credit.  A  Grammar  of 
the  Greek  New  Testament  in  the  Light 
of  Historical  Research  was  his  greatest 
contribution  to  the  serious  Bible  stu- 
dent, but  his  many  more  concise  New 
Testament  interpretations  have  been 
equally  helpful  to  the  average  Chris- 
tian. 

Among  his  most  popular  works  are : 
A  Harmony  of  the  Gospels  for  Students 
of  the  Life  of  Christ,  Paul  and  the  In- 
tellectuals, Studies  in  Mark's  Gospel, 
Studies  in  the  Epistle  of  James,  Epochs 
in  the  Life  of  Jesus,  and  Epochs  in  the 
Life  of  Paul.

THE  MEANING  OF  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Barclay  M.  Newman 

What  relationship,  if  any,  do  the  New  Testament  books  have 
to  the  social,  economic,  and  intellectual  conditions  of  the  time 
in  which  they  were  written?  How  can  an  understanding  of  this 
relationship  add  to  our  appreciation  of  the  New  Testament?  This 
illuminating  survey  provides  sound  and  satisfying  answers  to 
these  and  other  questions.  It  also  contains  a  brief  history  of  the 
New  Testament  canon  and  a  discussion  of  its  inspiration  and  au- 
thority. Has  numerous  maps,  drawings,  and  photographs. 


NEW  TESTAMENT  THEOLOGY 

Frank  Stagg 

This  study  emphasizes  the  New  Testament's  unity  of  thought 
and  defines  its  basic  concern  as  proclaiming  the  story  of  sal- 
vation. Dealing  with  various  New  Testament  theological  ques- 
tions—Christ, salvation,  the  church,  ordinances,  escatology,  and 
others— Dr.  Stagg  gives  fresh  meaning  and  understanding  of 
the  Bible  for  today.

This  six-volume  commentary  on  the 
New  Testament  was  published  in 
1930-33.  Ministers  and  other  Bible  stu- 
dents still  acclaim  it  for  combining 
thorough  scholarship  with  teaching 
skill  and  insight. 

"It  is  a  verse  by  verse  commentary 
on  the  English  text  (with  the  corre- 
sponding Greek  in  English  letters) 
stressing  those  meaningful  and  picto- 
rial suggestions  which  are  often  im- 
plicit in  the  original  significance  of 
the  words  but  are  lost  in  translation. 
.  .  .  The  author  makes  available  for 
those  who  do  not  know  Greek  a  large 
amount  of  critical  and  exegetical  ma- 
terial and  of  interpretative  insight  di- 
rectly connected  with  studies  in  the

Dr.  Robertson's  scholarship  was  at 
all  times  unimpeachable,  his  spiritual 
insight  was  profound,  and  his  style  was 
of  the  highest  order.  His  genial  wit,  his 
human  touch  and  interest,  and  his 
unique  phrasing  carry  an  appeal  for 
every  reader.

BY  WAY  OF  INTRODUCTION 

But  for  the  Acts  we  should  know  nothing  of  the  early 
apostolic  period  save  what  is  told  in  the  Epistles.  There  are 
various  apocryphal  "Acts,"  but  they  are  without  historical 
worth.    Hence  the  importance  of  this  book. 

Luke  the  Author 

It  ought  to  be  possible  to  assume  this  as  a  fact  since  the 
work  of  Ramsay  and  Harnack  on  various  phases  of  the 
problems  concerning  the  Acts.  Harnack,  in  particular,  has 
covered  the  ground  with  his  accustomed  thoroughness  and 
care  in  his  two  volumes  {The  Acts  of  the  Apostles^  English 
Translation  by  Rev.  J.  R.  Wilkinson,  1909;  The  Date  of  the 
Acts  and  the  Synoptic  Gospels,  English  Translation  by  Rev. 
J.  R.  Wilkinson,  1911).  Ramsay's  view  may  be  found  in 
Chapter  I  of  St.  Paul  the  Traveller  and  the  Roman  Citizen, 
Chapter  XII  of  Pauline  and  Other  Studies.  A  good  summary 
of  the  matter  appears  in  Part  V  of  The  Synoptic  Gospels 
and  the  Book  of  Acts  by  Dr.  D.  A.  Hayes,  in  Robertson's 
Luke  the  Historian  in  the  Light  of  Research,  and  in  the  intro- 
duction to  the  various  commentaries  by  Knowling,  Rack- 
ham,  Fumeaux,  Rendall,  Hackett,  Meyer-Wendt,  Zahn, 
Blass,  Campbell-Morgan,  Stokes.  In  Part  I  of  The  Acts  of 
the  Apostles,  Vol.  II  of  The  Beginnings  of  Christianity,  edited 
by  Foakes-Jackson  and  Kirsopp  Lake  both  sides  are  ably 
presented:  The  Case  for  the  Tradition  by  C.  W.  Emmet, 
The  Case  against  the  Tradition  by  H.  Windisch.  The  In- 
ternal Evidence  of  Acts  is  discussed  by  the  Editors,  Foakes- 
Jackson  and  Lake,  with  an  adverse  conclusion  against 
Luke.  Henry  J.  Cadbury  surveys  The  Tradition  (the  ex- 
ternal evidence)  and  draws  a  negative  conclusion  likewise 


viii  BY  WAY  OF  INTRODUCTION 

on  the  ground  that  the  early  writers  who  ascribe  Acts  to 
Luke  were  not  critical  scholars.  A  similar  position  is  taken 
by  Cadbury  in  his  more  recent  volume,  The  Making  of 
Luke — Acts  (1927).  But  all  the  same  the  traditional  view 
that  Luke  is  the  author  of  the  Acts  holds  the  field  with 
those  who  are  not  prejudiced  against  it.  The  view  of  Baur 
that  Acts  is  a  Tendenz  writing  for  the  purpose  of  healing 
the  breach  between  Peter  and  Paul  and  showing  that  the 
two  factions  came  together  had  great  influence  for  a  while. 
In  fact  both  Ramsay  and  Harnack  at  first  held  it.  Ramsay 
broke  away  first  and  he  was  followed  by  Harnack.  Both  were 
influenced  to  change  their  views  by  the  accumulation  of 
evidence  to  the  effect  that  the  author  of  both  the  Gospel  and 
Acts  is  Luke  the  Physician  and  Friend  of  Paul.  Part  of  this 
evidence  has  already  been  given  in  the  Introduction  to  the 
Gospel  according  to  Luke. 

The  Author  of  the  Gospel  Also 
The  author  of  the  Acts  expressly  states  that  he  wrote 
"the  first  treatise  {ton  proton  logon)  concerning  all  things, 
O  Theophilus,  that  Jesus  began  both  to  do  and  to  teach 
until  which  day  he  gave  command  through  the  Holy  Spirit 
to  the  apostles  whom  he  had  chosen  and  was  received  up" 
(Acts  I  :if.).  There  is  no  room  for  dispute  that  the  reference 
is  directly  to  the  Gospel  according  to  Luke  as  we  have  it 
now.  Like  the  Gospel  the  book  is  dedicated  to  Theophilus. 
And,  what  is  even  more  important,  the  same  style  appears 
in  both  Gospel  and  Acts.  This  fact  Harnack  has  shown  with 
great  pains  and  conclusiveness.  There  is  the  same  interest 
in  medical  matters  and  even  Cadbury,  who  denies  by  impli- 
cation the  Lukan  authorship,  admits  identity  of  authorship 
for  both  books. 

The  Unity  of  the  Acts 

There  are  some  scholars  who  are  willing  to  admit  the 
Lukan  authorship  of  the  "we"  sections  when  the  author 


BY  WAY  OF  INTRODUCTION  ix 

uses  "we"  and  "us"  as  in  chapter  16:10-40  and  20:6-28:31. 
It  has  been  argued  that  Luke  wrote  a  travel-document  or 
diary  for  these  sections,  but  that  this  material  was  used  by 
the  editor  or  redactor  of  the  whole  book.  But,  unfortunately 
for  that  view,  the  very  same  style  appears  in  the  Acts  as  a 
whole  and  in  the  Gospel  also  as  Harnack  has  proven.  The 
man  who  said  "we"  and  "us"  in  the  "we"  sections  wrote 
"I"  in  1:1  and  refers  to  the  Gospel  as  his  work.  The  effort 
to  disprove  the  unity  of  the  Acts  has  failed.  It  stands  as  the 
work  of  the  same  author  as  a  whole  and  the  same  author 
who  wrote  the  Gospel. 

Sources  of  the  Acts 

Beyond  a  doubt  Luke  employed  a  variety  of  sources  for 
this  great  history  as  he  did  for  the  Gospel  (Luke  i  :i-4). 
In  fact,  Cadbury  argues  that  this  Prologue  was  meant  to 
apply  to  the  Acts  also  as  Volume  II  whether  he  intended  to 
write  a  third  volume  or  not.  Certainly  we  are  entitled  to  say 
that  Luke  used  the  same  historical  method  for  Acts.  Some 
of  these  sources  are  easy  to  see.  Luke  had  his  own  personal 
experience  for  the  "we"  sections.  Then  he  had  the  benefit  of 
Paul's  own  notes  or  suggestions  for  all  that  portion  where 
Paul  figures  from  chapters  8  to  28,  since  Luke  was  appar- 
ently with  Paul  in  Rome  when  he  finished  the  Book.  This 
would  include  Paul's  sermons  and  addresses  which  Luke 
gives  unless  one  wishes  to  say,  as  some  do,  that  Luke  fol- 
lowed the  style  of  Thucydides  and  composed  the  kind  of 
addresses  that  he  thought  Paul  would  make.  I  see  no  evi- 
dence of  that  for  each  address  differs  from  the  others  and 
suits  precisely  the  occasion  when  it  was  delivered.  The 
ancients  frequently  employed  shorthand  and  Paul  may  have 
preserved  notes  of  his  addresses.  Prof.  C.  C.  Torrey,  of 
Yale  University,  argues  in  his  Composition  and  Date  of  Acts 
(1916)  that  Luke  used  an  Aramaic  document  for  the  first 
fifteen  chapters  of  the  Acts.   There  is  an  Aramaic  element  in 


X  BY  WAY  OF  INTRODUCTION 

certain  portions  of  these  chapters,  but  nothing  like  so  pro- 
nounced as  in  Luke  i  and  2  after  i  :i-4.  It  cannot  be  said 
that  Torrey  has  made  out  his  case  for  such  a  single  docu- 
ment. Luke  may  have  had  several  such  documents  besides 
access  to  others  familiar  with  the  early  days  of  the  work  in 
Jerusalem.  There  was  Simon  Peter  whom  Paul  visited  for 
two  weeks  in  Jerusalem  (Gal.  i:i8)  besides  other  points  of 
contact  with  him  in  Jerusalem  and  Antioch  (Acts  15  and 
Gal.  2).  There  was  also  Barnabas  who  was  early  Paul's 
friend  (Acts  9:27)  and  who  knew  the  beginnings  as  few  did 
(Acts  4:36f.).  Besides  many  others  it  is  to  be  observed  that 
Paul  with  Luke  made  a  special  visit  to  Caesarea  where  he 
spent  a  week  with  the  gifted  Philip  and  his  daughters  with 
the  gift  of  prophecy  (Acts  21 :8f.).  But  with  all  the  inevitable 
variety  of  sources  for  the  information  needed  to  cover  the 
wide  field  of  the  Book  of  Acts  the  same  mind  has  mani- 
festly worked  through  it  and  it  is  the  same  style  all  through 
that  appears  in  the  "we"  sections  where  the  writer  is  con- 
fessedly a  companion  of  Paul.  No  other  companion  of  Paul 
carries  this  claim  for  the  authorship  and  no  other  was  a 
physician  and  no  author  has  the  external  evidence  from  early 
writers. 

The  Date 

There  are  three  views  about  the  date  of  the  Acts.  Baur 
and  his  Tubingen  School  held  the  second  century  to  be  the 
date  of  this  late  pamphlet  as  they  termed  it  after  the  fashion 
of  the  Clementine  Homilies.  But  that  view  is  now  prac- 
tically abandoned  save  by  the  few  who  still  strangely  oppose 
the  Lukan  authorship.  Probably  the  majority  of  those  who 
accept  the  Lukan  authorship  place  it  in  the  latter  part  of 
the  first  century  for  two  reasons.  One  is  that  the  Gospel 
according  to  Luke  is  dated  by  them  after  the  destruction  of 
Jerusalem  because  of  the  prophecy  by  Jesus  of  the  encom- 
passing of  the  city  by  armies.     Predictive  prophecy  that 


BY  WAY  OF  INTRODUCTION  xi 

would  be  and  so  it  is  considered  a  prophecy  post  eventum. 
The  other  reason  is  the  alleged  use  of  the  Antiquities  of 
Josephus  by  Luke.  Josephus  finished  this  work  a.d.  93  so 
that,  if  Luke  did  use  it,  he  must  have  written  the  Acts 
after  that  date.  Usually  this  argument  is  made  to  show  that 
Luke  could  not  have  written  it  at  all,  but  some  hold  that  he 
may  have  lived  to  an  age  that  would  allow  it.  But  it  cannot 
be  assumed  that  Luke  used  Josephus  because  of  his  mention 
of  Theudas  and  Judas  the  Galilean.  They  differ  so  widely 
(Acts  5:36f.  and  Josephus,  Ant.  XX.  v,  i,  2)  that  Von  Dob- 
schiitz  {Dictionary  of  the  Apostolic  Church,  art.  Josephus) 
argues  that  the  two  accounts  are  entirely  independent  of 
each  other.  So  Luke  (Lu.  13  :if.)  alludes  to  a  Galilean  revolt 
not  mentioned  by  Josephus  and  Josephus  records  three 
revolts  under  Pilate  not  referred  to  by  Luke.  A  comparison 
of  the  accounts  of  the  death  of  Agrippa  I  in  Acts  12:20-23 
and  Ant.  XIX.  viii,  2  redounds  to  the  credit  of  Luke.  The 
Josephus  phase  of  the  argument  may  be  brushed  to  one 
side.  The  third  view,  held  by  Hamack  and  adopted  here, 
is  that  Luke  wrote  the  Acts  while  with  Paul  in  Rome  and 
finished  the  book  before  Paul's  release,  that  is  by  a.d.  63. 
This  is  the  obvious  and  natural  way  to  take  the  language  of 
Luke  at  the  close  of  Acts.  Events  had  gone  no  farther  and 
so  he  ends  the  narrative  right  there.  It  is  argued  against 
this  that  Luke  contemplated  a  third  volume  and  for  this 
reason  closed  with  the  arrival  of  Paul  in  Rome.  But  the 
use  of  proton  (first)  in  Acts  I  :i  is  a  common  Koine  idiom  and 
does  not  imply  three  volumes  any  more  than  first  and  second 
stories  with  us  means  that  the  house  has  three.  Of  course 
this  date  for  the  Acts  puts  the  date  of  the  Gospel  further 
back  either  in  Caesarea  (57  to  59)  or  in  Rome  (60  to  62). 
And  that  means  that  Mark's  Gospel  is  still  earlier  since 
Luke  used  it  for  his  Gospel  and  the  Logia  (Q)  earlier  still. 
But  all  these  dates  are  probable  in  the  light  of  all  the  known 
facts. 


xii  BY  WAY  OF  INTRODUCTION 

The  Historical  Value 

It  was  once  a  fafd  with  a  certain  school  of  critics  to  decry 
Luke  in  the  Acts  as  wholly  untrustworthy,  not  above  the 
legendary  stage.  But  the  spade  has  done  well  by  Luke  for 
inscriptions  and  papyri  have  brought  remarkable  confirma- 
tion for  scores  of  points  where  Luke  once  stood  all  alone  and 
was  discounted  because  he  stood  alone.  These  will  be  duly 
noted  in  the  proper  places  as  they  occur.  Ramsay  has  done 
most  in  this  restoration  of  the  rank  of  Luke  as  a  credible 
historian,  as  shown  in  particular  in  his  St.  Paul  the  Traveller 
and  the  Roman  Citizen  and  in  The  Bearing  of  Recent  Dis- 
covery on  the  Trustworthiness  of  the  New  Testament.  In  every 
instance  where  discoveries  have  been  made  they  have  con- 
firmed the  testimony  of  Luke  as  concerning  politarchs  in 
Thessalonica,  proconsul  in  Cyprus,  etc.  The  result  is  that 
the  balance  of  evidence  is  now  in  favour  of  Luke  even  when  he 
still  stands  alone  or  seems  to  be  opposed  by  Josephus.  Luke, 
as  it  stands  today,  is  a  more  credible  historian  than  Jose- 
phus. Ramsay  dares  to  call  Luke,  all  things  considered, 
the  greatest  of  all  historians,  even  above  Thucydides.  An 
interesting  book  on  this  phase  of  the  subject  is  Chase's 
The  Credibility  of  the  Acts  of  the  Apostles  (1902). 

The  Purpose  of  the  Acts 

It  is  not  easy  to  say  in  a  word  precisely  the  object  of 
Luke  in  writing  this  book.  It  is  not  the  Acts  of  all  the  apos- 
tles. Outside  of  Peter  and  John  little  is  told  of  any  of  them 
after  chapter  3.  And  all  the  acts  of  Peter  and  John  are 
not  given  for  Peter  disappears  from  the  narrative  after  chap- 
ter 15,  though  he  has  been  the  central  figure  through  chapter 
II.  Paul  is  not  one  of  the  twelve  apostles,  but  Luke  follows 
Paul's  career  mainly  after  chapter  8.  Stephen  and  Barnabas 
come  in  also.  Still  {St.  Paul  on  Trial,  1923)  argues  that 
Luke  meant  the  book  as  an  apology  to  be  used  in  Paul's

trial  at  Rome  or  at  any  rate  to  put  Paul  in  the  right  light 
with  the  Jews  in  Rome.  Hence  the  full  account  of  Paul's 
series  of  defences  in  Jerusalem,  Caesarea,  Rome.  There 
may  be  an  element  of  truth  in  this  idea,  but  it  clearly  does 
not  cover  the  whole  purpose  of  Luke.  Others  hold  that  Luke 
had  a  dramatic  plan  to  get  Paul  to  Rome  as  the  climax  of 
his  campaign  to  win  the  Roman  Empire  to  Christ.  The 
book  is  not  a  history  of  all  early  Christianity.  Peter  and 
Paul  dominate  the  atmosphere  of  the  book  with  Paul  as 
the  great  hero  of  Luke.  But  one  can  easily  see  that  the  work 
is  done  with  consummate  skill.  The  author  is  a  man  of  cul- 
ture, of  Christian  grace,  of  literary  power.  The  book  pulses 
with  life  today. 

The  Text  of  the  Acts 

A  special  problem  arises  concerning  the  text  of  Acts  in- 
asmuch as  the  Codex  Bezae  (D)  with  some  other  Western 
support  presents  a  great  many  additions  to  the  Neutral- 
Alexandrian  text  of  Aleph  ABC.  Blass  has  even  proposed 
the  idea  that  Luke  himself  issued  two  editions  of  the  book, 
an  attractive  hypothesis  that  is  not  generally  accepted. 
J.  M.  Wilson  has  published  The  Acts  of  the  Apostles  from 
Codex  Bezae.  The  whole  subject  is  elaborately  treated  by 
J.  H.  Ropes  in  Vol.  Ill,  The  Text  of  Acts  in  Part  I  of  The 
Beginnings  of  Christianity.  Besides  thorough  discussion  of 
all  the  problems  of  text  involved  Ropes  gives  the  text  of 
the  Vatican  Codex  (B)  on  the  left  page  and  that  of  Codex 
Bezae  (D)  on  the  right,  making  comparison  easy.  Blass's 
ideas  appear  in  his  Acta  Apostolorum.

THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES 


CHAPTER  I 

The  Title  is  simply  Acts  (Praxeis)  in  Aleph,  Origen, 
Tertullian,  Didymus,  Hilary,  Eusebius,  Epiphanius.  The 
Acts  of  the  Apostles  {Praxeis  apostolon)  is  the  reading  of 
B  D  (Aleph  in  subscription)  Athanasius,  Origen,  Tertul- 
lian, Cyprian,  Eusebius,  Cyril  of  Jerusalem,  Theodoret, 
Hilary.  The  Acts  of  the  Holy  Apostles  {Praxeis  ton  hagion 
apostolon)  is  read  by  A^  E  G  H  A  K  Chrysostom.  It  is  pos- 
sible that  the  book  was  given  no  title  at  all  by  Luke,  for 
it  is  plain  that  usage  varied  greatly  even  in  the  same  writers. 
The  long  title  as  found  in  the  Textus  Receptus  (Authorized 
Version)  is  undoubtedly  wrong  with  the  adjective  "Holy." 
The  reading  of  B  D,  "  The  Acts  of  the  Apostles^^  may  be 
accepted  as  probably  correct. 

I.  The  former  treatise  {ton  men  proton).  Literally,  the 
first  treatise.  The  use  of  the  superlative  is  common  enough 
and  by  no  means  implies,  though  it  allows,  a  third  volume. 
This  use  of  protos  where  only  two  are  compared  is  seen  be- 
tween the  Baptist  and  Jesus  (John  1:15),  John  and  Peter 
(John  20:4).  The  idiom  is  common  in  the  papyri  (Robert- 
son, Grammar,  pp.  662,  669).  The  use  of  men  solitarium 
here,  as  Hackett  notes,  is  common  in  Acts.  It  is  by  no  means 
true  that  men  requires  a  following  de  by  contrast.  The  word 
is  merely  a  weakened  form  of  7n^n  =  surely,  indeed.  The 
reference  is  to  the  "first  treatise"  and  merely  emphasizes 
that.  The  use  of  logos  {word)  for  treatise  or  historical  narra- 
tive is  common  in  ancient  Greek  as  in  Herodotus  6  and  9. 
Plato  {Phaedo,  p.  61  B)  makes  a  contrast  between  muthos 
and  logos.  I  made  {epoiesamen).  Aorist  middle  indicative, 
the  middle  being  the  usual  construction  for  mental  acts 
with  poieo.    O  Theophilus  {0  Theophile).    The  interjection 


4  WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

O  here  as  is  common,  though  not  in  Luke  1:3.  But  the 
adjective  kratiste  (most  excellent)  is  wanting  here.  See 
remarks  on  Theophilus  on  Luke  1 13.  Hackett  thinks  that  he 
lived  at  Rome  because  of  the  way  Acts  ends.  He  was  a  man 
of  rank.  He  may  have  defrayed  the  expense  of  publishing 
both  Luke  and  Acts.  Perhaps  by  this  time  Luke  may  have 
reached  a  less  ceremonious  acquaintance  with  Theophilus. 
Which  Jesus  began  {hon  erxato  lesous).  The  relative  is 
attracted  from  the  accusative  ha  to  the  genitive  hbn  because 
of  the  antecedent  panton  (all).  The  language  of  Luke  here 
is  not  merely  pleonastic  as  Winer  held.  Jesus  "began" 
"both  to  do  and  to  teach"  (poiein  te  kai  didaskein).  Note 
present  infinitives,  linear  action,  still  going  on,  and  the  use 
of  te — kai  binds  together  the  life  and  teachings  of  Jesus,  as 
if  to  say  that  Jesus  is  still  carrying  on  from  heaven  the  work 
and  teaching  of  the  disciples  which  he  started  while  on  earth 
before  his  ascension.  The  record  which  Luke  now  records 
is  really  the  Acts  of  Jesus  as  much  as  the  Acts  of  the  Apos- 
tles. Dr.  A.  T.  Pierson  called  it  "The  Acts  of  the  Holy 
Spirit,"  and  that  is  true  also.  The  Acts,  according  to  Luke, 
is  a  continuation  of  the  doings  and  teachings  of  Jesus.  "The 
following  writings  appear  intended  to  give  us,  and  do,  in 
fact,  profess  to  give  us,  that  which  Jesus  continued  to  do  and 
teach  after  the  day  in  which  he  was  taken  up"  (Bernard, 
Progress  of  Doctrine  in  the  N.T.). 

2.  Until  the  day  in  which  (achri  hes  hemeras).  Incorpora- 
tion of  the  antecedent  into  the  relative  clause  and  the  change 
of  case  hei  (locative)  to  hes  (genitive).  Was  received  up 
(anelempthe).  First  aorist  passive  indicative  of  analambanb. 
Common  verb  to  lift  anything  up  (Acts  10:16)  or  person  as 
Paul  (Acts  20:13).  Several  times  of  the  Ascension  of  Jesus 
to  heaven  (Mark  16:19;  Acts  1:2,  11,  22;  I  Tim.  3:16)  with 
or  without  "into  heaven"  {eis  ton  ouranon).  This  same  verb 
is  used  of  Elijah's  translation  to  heaven  in  the  LXX  (II 
Kings  2:11).     The  same  idea,  though  not  this  word,  is  in 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  5 

Luke  24:51.  See  Luke  9:51  for  analempsis  of  the  Ascension. 
Had  given  commandment  {enteilamenos).  First  aorist  middle 
participle  of  entello  (from  en  and  tello^  to  accomplish),  usually 
in  the  middle,  old  verb,  to  enjoin.  This  special  command- 
ment refers  directly  to  what  we  call  the  commission  given 
the  apostles  before  Christ  ascended  on  high  (John  20:21-23; 
Matt.  28:16-20  =  Mark  16:15-18  =  !  Cor.  15:6;  Luke  24:44- 
49).  He  had  given  commands  to  them  when  they  were  first 
chosen  and  when  they  were  sent  out  on  the  tour  of  Galilee, 
but  the  immediate  reference  is  as  above.  Through  the  Holy 
Spirit  {did  pneumatos  hagiou).  In  his  human  life  Jesus  was 
under  the  guidance  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  This  applies  to  the 
choice  of  the  apostles  (Luke  6:13)  and  to  these  special  com- 
mands before  the  Ascension.  Whom  he  had  chosen  (hous 
exelexato).  Aorist  middle  indicative,  not  past  perfect.  The 
same  verb  (eklexamenos)  was  used  by  Luke  in  describing 
the  choice  of  the  twelve  by  Jesus  (Luke  6:13).  But  the 
aorist  does  not  stand  "for"  our  English  pluperfect  as  Hackett 
says.  That  is  explaining  Greek  by  English.  The  Western 
text  here  adds:  "And  ordered  to  proclaim  the  gospel." 

3.  To  whom  also  (hois  kai).  He  chose  them  and  then  also 
manifested  himself  to  these  very  same  men  that  they  might 
have  personal  witness  to  give.  Shewed  himself  alive  {pares- 
tesen  heauton  zbnta).  To  the  disciples  the  first  Sunday  eve- 
ning (Mark  i6:i4  =  Luke  24:36-43  =  John  20:19-25),  the 
second  Sunday  evening  (John  20:26-29),  ^^  ^he  Sea  of 
Tiberias  (John  21:1-23),  on  the  mountain  in  Galilee  (Matt. 
28:16-20  =  Mark  16:15-18  =  !  Cor.  15:6),  to  the  disciples  in 
Jerusalem  and  Olivet  (Luke  24:44-53;  Mark  i6-i9f.  =Acts 
I  :i-ii).  Luke  uses  this  verb  paristemi  13  times  in  the  Acts 
both  transitively  and  intransitively.  It  is  rendered  by  various 
English  words  (present,  furnish,  provide,  assist,  commend). 
The  early  disciples  including  Paul  never  doubted  the  fact  of 
the  Resurrection,  once  they  were  convinced  by  personal  ex- 
perience.    At  first  some  doubted  like  Thomas  (Mark  16:14; 


6  WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Luke  24:41 ;  John  20:24f.;  Matt.  28:17).  ^^^  after  that  they 
never  wavered  in  their  testimony  to  their  own  experience 
with  the  Risen  Christ,  "whereof  we  are  witnesses"  Peter 
said  (Acts  3:15).  They  doubted  at  first,  that  we  may  be- 
lieve, but  at  last  they  risked  life  itself  in  defence  of  this  firm 
faith.  After  his  passion  {meta  to  pathein  auton).  Neat  Greek 
idiom,  meta  with  the  articular  infinitive  (second  aorist 
active  of  pascho)  and  the  accusative  of  general  reference, 
"after  the  suffering  as  to  him."  For  pathein  used  absolutely 
of  Christ's  suffering  see  also  Acts  17:3;  26:23.  ^J  fnany 
proofs  {en  pollois  tekmeriois).  Literally,  "in  many  proofs." 
Tekmerion  is  only  here  in  the  N.T.,  though  an  old  and  com- 
mon word  in  ancient  Greek  and  occurring  in  the  Koine 
(papyri,  etc.).  The  verb  tekmairo^  to  prove  by  sure  signs,  is 
from  tekmar,  a  sign.  Luke  does  not  hesitate  to  apply  the 
definite  word  "proofs"  to  the  evidence  for  the  Resurrection 
of  Christ  after  full  investigation  on  the  part  of  this  scientific 
historian.  Aristotle  makes  a  distinction  between  tekmerion 
(proof)  and  semeion  (sign)  as  does  Galen  the  medical  writer. 
Appearing  (optanomenos).  Present  middle  participle  from 
late  verb  optano,  late  Koine  verb  from  root  opto  seen  in 
opsomai,  ophthen.  In  LXX,  papyri  of  second  century  B.C. 
(Deissmann,  Light  from  the  Ancient  East,  p.  83).  Only  here 
in  the  N.T.  For  optasia  for  vision  see  Acts  26:19;  Luke  i  :22; 
24:23.  By  the  space  of  forty  days  {dV  hemeron  tesserakonta). 
At  intervals  {dia,  between)  during  the  forty  days,  ten  ap- 
pearances being  known  to  us.  Jesus  was  not  with  them 
continually  now  in  bodily  presence.  The  period  of  forty 
days  is  given  here  alone.  The  Ascension  was  thus  ten  days 
before  Pentecost  when  the  Holy  Spirit  came.  Moses  was  in 
the  mount  forty  days  (Ex.  24:18)  and  Jesus  fasted  forty 
days  (Matt.  4:2).  In  the  Gospel  of  Luke  24  this  separation 
of  forty  days  between  the  Resurrection  and  the  Ascension 
is  not  drawn.  The  things  concerning  the  Kingdom  of  God 
[ta  peri  t?s  hasileias  tou  theou).   This  phrase  appears  33  times 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  7 

in  Luke's  Gospel,  15  times  in  Mark,  4  times  in  Matthew 
who  elsewhere  has  "the  kingdom  of  heaven,"  once  in  John, 
and  6  times  in  Acts.  No  essential  distinction  is  to  be  drawn 
between  the  two  for  the  Jews  often  used  "heaven"  rather 
than  "God"  to  avoid  using  the  Tetragrammaton.  But  it  is 
noticeable  how  the  word  kingdom  drops  out  of  Acts.  Other 
words  like  gospel  {euaggelion)  take  the  place  of  "kingdom." 
Jesus  was  fond  of  the  word  "kingdom"  and  Luke  is  fond  of 
the  idiom  "the  things  concerning"  {ta  peri).  Certainly  with 
Jesus  the  term  "kingdom"  applies  to  the  present  and  the 
future  and  covers  so  much  that  it  is  not  strange  that  the 
disciples  with  their  notions  of  a  political  Messianic  king- 
dom (Acts  1:6)  were  slow  to  comprehend  the  spiritual  na- 
ture of  the  reign  of  God. 

4.  Being  assembled  together  with  them  {sunalizomenos). 
Present  passive  participle  from  sunalizo,  an  old  verb  in 
Herodotus,  Xenophon,  etc.,  from  sun,  with,  and  halizo,  from 
hales,  crowded.  The  margin  of  both  the  Authorized  and  the 
Revised  Versions  has  "eating  with  them"  as  if  from  sun 
and  hals  (salt).  Salt  was  the  mark  of  hospitality.  There  is 
the  verb  halisthete  en  autoi  used  by  Ignatius  y^d  Magnes. 
X,  "Be  ye  salted  in  him."  But  it  is  more  than  doubtful  if 
that  is  the  idea  here  though  the  Vulgate  does  have  con- 
vescens  illis  "eating  with  them,"  as  if  that  was  the  common 
habit  of  Jesus  during  the  forty  days  (Wendt,  Peine,  etc.). 
Jesus  did  on  occasion  eat  with  the  disciples  (Luke  24:41-43 
=  Mark  16:14).  ^^  wait  for  the  promise  of  the  Father  {per- 
imenein  ten  epaggelian  tou  patros).  Note  present  active 
infinitive,  to  keep  on  waiting  for  (around,  peri).  In  the 
Great  Commission  on  the  mountain  in  Galilee  this  item  was 
not  given  (Matt.  28:16-20).  It  Is  the  subjective  genitive, 
the  promise  given  by  the  Father  (note  this  Johannlne  use 
of  the  word),  that  Is  the  Holy  Spirit  ("the  promise  of  the 
Holy  Spirit,"  objective  genitive).  Which  ye  heard  from  me 
{hen  ekousaie  mou).    Change  from  Indirect  discourse  (com- 


8  WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

mand),  infinitives  chbrizesthai  and  perimenein  after  pareg- 
geilen  to  direct  discourse  without  any  ephe  (said  he)  as  the 
English  (Italics).  Luke  often  does  this  (or<2fzo  &ar{(2/a).  Note 
also  the  ablative  case  of  mou  (from  me).  Luke  continues  in 
verse  5  with  the  direct  discourse  giving  the  words  of  Jesus. 

5.  Baptized  with  water  (ebaptisen  hudati)  and  with  the 
Holy  Ghost  {en  pneumati  baptisthesesthe  hagidi).  The  margin 
has  "in  the  Holy  Ghost"  (Spirit,  it  should  be).  The  Ameri- 
can Standard  Version  renders  "in"  both  with  "water" 
and  "Holy  Spirit"  as  do  Goodspeed  (American  Translation) 
and  Mrs.  Montgomery  (Centenary  Translation).  John's 
own  words  (Matt.  3:11)  to  which  Jesus  apparently  refers 
use  en  (in)  both  with  water  and  Spirit.  There  is  a  so-called 
instrumental  use  of  en  where  we  in  English  have  to  say 
"with"  (Rev.  13:10  en  machairei,  like  machairei,  Acts  12:2). 
That  is  to  say  en  with  the  locative  presents  the  act  as  lo- 
cated in  a  certain  instrument  like  a  sword  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  pp.  sSQf.).  But  the  instrumental  case  is  more 
common  without  en  (the  locative  and  instrumental  cases 
having  the  same  form).  So  it  is  often  a  matter  of  indifference 
which  idiom  is  used  as  in  John  21:8  we  have  toi  ploiarioi 
(locative  without  en).  They  came  in  (locative  case  without 
en)  the  boat.  So  in  John  1:31  en  hudati  baptizon  baptizing 
in  water.  No  distinction  therefore  can  be  insisted  on  here 
between  the  construction  hudati  and  en  pneumati  (both 
being  in  the  locative  case,  one  without,  one  with  en).  Note 
unusual  position  of  the  verb  baptisthesesthe  (future  passive 
indicative)  between  pneumati  and  hagidi.  This  baptism 
of  the  Holy  Spirit  was  predicted  by  John  (Matt.  3:1 1)  as  the 
characteristic  of  the  Messiah's  work.  Now  the  Messiah  him- 
self in  his  last  message  before  his  Ascension  proclaims  that 
in  a  few  days  the  fulfilment  of  that  prophecy  will  come  to 
pass.  The  Codex  Bezae  adds  here  "which  ye  are  about  to 
receive"  and  "until  the  Pentecost"  to  verse  5.  Not  many 
days  hence  (ou  meta  pollas  tautas  hemeras).    A  neat  Greek 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  9 

idiom  difficult  to  render  smoothly  into  English:  "Not  after 
many  days  these."  The  litotes  (not  many  =  few)  is  common 
in  Luke  (7:6;  15:13;  Acts  17:27;  19:11;  20:12;  21:39;  28:14; 
28:2).  The  predicate  use  of  tautas  (without  article)  is  to  be 
noted.  "These"  really  means  as  a  starting  point,  "from 
these"  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  702).  It  was  ten  days 
hence.  This  idiom  occurs  several  times  in  Luke  (24:21; 
Acts  24:21),  as  elsewhere  (John  4:18;  II  Pet.  3:1).  In  Luke 
2:12  the  copula  is  easily  supplied  as  it  exists  in  Luke  1:36;  2:2. 

— j^  6.  They  therefore  {hoi  men  oun).  Demonstrative  use  of  hoi 
with  men  oun  without  any  corresponding  de  just  as  in  i:i 
men  occurs  alone.  The  combination  men  oun  is  common  in 
Acts  (27  times),  Cf.  Luke  3:18.  The  oun  is  resumptive  and 
refers  to  the  introductory  verses  (1:1-5),  which  served  to 
connect  the  Acts  with  the  preceding  Gospel.  The  narrative 
now  begins.  Asked  (eroton).  Imperfect  active,  repeatedly 
asked  before  Jesus  answered.  Lord  {kurie).  Here  not  in 
~tKe~sense'or^1ir "  (Matt.  21:30),  but  to  Jesus  as  Lord  and 

J  Master  as  often  in  Acts  (19:5,  10,  etc.)  and  in  prayer  to 
Jesus  (7:59).  Dost  thou  restore  {ei  apokathistaneis).  The  use 
of  ei  in  an  indirect  question  is  common.  We  have  already 
seen  its  use  in  direct  questions  (Matt.  12:10;  Luke  13:23 
which  see  for  discussion),  possibly  in  imitation  of  the  Hebrew 
(frequent  in  the  LXX)  or  as  a  partial  condition  without 
conclusion.  See  also  Acts  7:1;  19:2;  21:37;  22:25.  The  form 
of  the  verb  apokathistano  is  late  (also  apokathistao)  omega 
form  for  the  old  and  common  apokathisiemi,  double  com- 
pound, to  restore  to  its  former  state.  As  a  matter  of  fact  the 
Messianic  kingdom  for  which  they  are  asking  is  a  ^Utical 
kingdom  that  would  throw  off  the  hated  Roman  yoke.  It  is 
a  futuristic  present  and  they  are  uneasy  that  jTesus  may  yet 
fail  to  fulfil  their  hopes..  Surely  here  is  proof  that  the  eleven 
apostles  needed  the  promise  of  the  Father  before  they  began 
to  spread  the  message  of  the  Risen  Christ.  They  still  yearn 
for  a  political  kingdom  for  Israel  even  after  faith  and  hope 


/

have  come  back.   They  need  the  enlightenment  of  the  Holy 
Spirit  (John  14-16)  and  the  power  of  the  Holy  Spirit  (Acts 

i:4f.). 

7.  Times  or  seasons  {chronous  e  kairous).  "Periods"  and 
"points'*  of  time  sometimes  and  probably  so  here,  but  such 
a  distinction  is  not^lways  maintained.  See  Acts  17:26  for 
kairous  in  the  same  sense  as  chronous  for  long  periods  of 
time.  But  here  some  distinction  seems  to  be  called  for.  It  is 
curious  how  ea^er  people  have  always  been  to  fix  definite^ 
dates  about  the  second  coming  of  Christ  as  the  apostles 
were  about  the  political  Messianic  kingdom  which  they 
were  expecting.  Hath  set  (etheto).  Second  aprist  rniddle 
indicative,  emphasizing  the  sovereigiity  of  the  Father  in 
keeping  all  such  matters  to  himself,  a  gentle  hint  to  people 
today  about  the  limits  of  curiosity.  Note  also  "his  own" 
(ididt)  "authority"  (exousidi). 

8.  Power  (dunamin).  Not  the  "power"  about  which  they 
were  concerned  (political  organization  and  equipments 
for  empire  on  the  order  of  Rome).  Their  very  question  was 
ample  proof  of  their  need  of  this  new  "power"  (dunamin) y 
to  enable  them  (from  dunamai,  to  .he  able),  to  grapple 
with  the  spread  of  the  gospel  in  the  world.  fFhen  the  Holy 
Ghost  is  come  upon  you  {epelthontos  tou  hagiou  pneumatos 
eph*  humas).  Genitive  absolute  and  is  simultaneous  in  time 
with  the  preceding  verb  "shall  receive"  (lempsesthe).  The 
Holy  Spirit  will  give  them  the  "power"  as  he  comes  upon 
them.  This  is  the  baptism  of  the  Holy  Spirit  referred  to  in 
verse  5.  My  witnesses  {mou  martures).  Correct  text.  "Royal 
words  of  magnificent  and  Divine  assurance"  (Furneaux). 
Our  word  martyrs  is  this  word  martures.  In  Luke  24:48 
Jesus  calls  the  disciples  "witnesses  to  these  things"  (mar' 
tures  toutony  objective  genitive).  (In  Acts  1:22  an  apostle 
has  to  be  a  "witness  to  the  Resurrection"  of  Christ  and  in 
10:39  ^o  ^he  life  and  work  of  Jesus.  Hence  there  could^e  no 
"apostles"  in  this  sense  after  the  first  generationT}  But  here 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  II 

the  apostles  are  called  "ni^  witnesses."  "His  by  a  direct 
personal  relationship"  (Knowling).  The  expanding  sphere 
of  their  witness  when  the  Holy  Spirit  comes  upon  them  is 
"unto  the  uttermost  part  of  the  earth"  {heos  eschatou  tes 
ges).  Once  they  had  been  commanded  to  avoid  Samaria 
(Matt.  10:5),  but  now  it  is  included  in  the  world  program 
as  already  outlined  on  the  mountain  in  Galilee  (Matt. 
28:19  =  Mark  16:15).  Jesus  is  on  Olivet  as  he  points  to 
Jerusalem,  Judea,  Samaria,  the  uttermost  (last,  eschatou) 
part  of  the  earth.  The  program  still  beckons  us  on  to  world 
conquest  for  Christ.  "The  Acts  themselves  form  the  best 
commentary  on  these  words,  and  the  words  themselves 
might  be  given  as  the  best  summary  of  the  Acts"  (Page). 
The  events  follow  this  outline  (Jerusalem  till  the  end  of 
chapter  7,  with  the  martyrdom  of  Stephen,  the  scattering 
of  the  saints  through  Judea  and  Samaria  in  chapter  8,  the 
conversion  of  Saul,  chapter  9,  the  spread  of  the  gospel  to 
Romans  in  Caesarea  by  Peter  (chapter  10),  to  Greeks  in 
Antioch  (chapter  11),  finally  Paul's  world  tours  and  arrest 
and  arrival  in  Rome  (chapters  11  to  28). 

9.  As  they  were  looking  {bleponton  auton).  Genitive  abso- 
lute. The  present  participle  accents  the  fact  that  they  were 
lookin£^  directly  at  Jesus.  He  was  taken  up  (eperthe).  First 
aorist  passive  indicative  of  epairo,  old  and  common  verb 
meaning  toJ[iftjip.  In  Luke  24:51  we  have  "he  was  borne 
up"  (anephereto)  and  in  Acts  1:2,  i:ii;  I  Tim.  3:6  "was 
received  up"  (anelempthe) .  Received  (hupelaben).  Second 
aorist  active  indicative  of  hupolambanOy  literally  here  "took 
under  him."  He  seemed  to  be  supported  by  the  cloud. 
"In  glory"  Paul  adds  in  I  Tim.  3:16.  Out  of  their  sight 
{apo  ton  ophthalmon  auton).  From  their  eyes  (apo  with 
ablative  case). 

10.  fFere  looking  steadfastly  (atenizontes  esan).  Peri- 
phrastic imperfect  active  of  atenizOy  a  late  intensive  verb 
(intensive  a  and  teino,  to  stretch).  Common  in  Acts  and  also 


12        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

in  Luke  4:20  and  22:56  as  well  as  Acts  10:4,  which  see. 
As  he  went  {poreuomenou  autou).  Genitive  absolute  of 
present  middle  participle.  They  saw  him  slipping  away 
from  their  eyes  as  the  cloud  bore  him  away.  Stood  by  them 
(pareistekeisan  autois).  Past  perfect  active  indicative  of 
paristemi  and  intransitive  (note  i  in  B  instead  of  ei  for 
augment,  mere  itacism). 

11.  fFho  also  (hoi  kai).  Common  use  of  kai  pleonastic 
to  show  that  the  two  events  were  parallel.  This  is  the  sim- 
plest way  from  Homer  on  to  narrate  two  parallel  events. 
Why?  (ti).  Jesus  had  tojd  them  of  his  coming  Ascension 
(John  6:62;  20:17)  so  that  theyjilmjildjiaye  been  prepared. 
This  Jesus  (houtos  ho  lesous).  Qui  vobis  fuit  eritque  semper 
Jesus  J  id  est  J  Salvator  (Corn,  a  Lapide).  The  personal  name 
assures  them  that  Jesus  will  always  be  in  heaven  a  personal 
friend  and  divine  Saviour  (Knowling).     So  in  like  manner 

\houtos  hon  tropon).  Same  idea  twice.  "So  in  which  manner" 
(incorporation  of  antecedent  and  accusative  of  general 
reference).  The  fact  of  his  second  coming  and  the  manner 
of  it  also  described  by  this  emphatic  repetition. 

12.  Olivet  (Elaionos).  Genitive  singular.  Vulgate  Olive- 
turn.  Made  like  ampelon.  Here  only  in  the  N.T.,  usually 
to  oros  ton  Elaibn  (the  Mount  of  Olives),  though  some  MSS. 
have  Olivet  in  Luke  19:29;  21:37.  Josephus  {Ant.  VII.  9,  2) 
has  it  also  and  the  papyri  (Deissmann,  Light  from  the  Ancient 
East  J  p.  170).  A  sabbath  day^s  journey  off  {Sabbatou  echon 
hodon).  Luke  only  says  here  that  Olivet  is  a  Sabbath  day's 
journey  from  Jerusalem,  not  that  Jesus  was  precisely  that 
distance  when  he  ascended.  In  the  Gospel  Luke  (24:50) 
states  that  Jesus  led  them  "over  against"  {heos  pros) 
Bethany  (about  two  miles  or  fifteen  furlongs).  The  top  of 
Olivet  is  six  furlongs  or  three-fourths  of  a  mile.  The  Greek 
idiom  here  is  "having  a  journey  of  a  Sabbath"  after  "which 
is  nigh  unto  Jerusalem"  {ho  estin  eggus  lerousalem)^  note 
the  periphrastic  construction.     Why  Luke  mentions  this 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  13 

item  for  Gentile  readers  in  this  form  is  not  known,  unless 
it  was  in  his  Jewish  source.  See  Ex.  16:29;  Numb.  35:5; 
Josh.  3  4.  But  it  does  not  contradict  what  he  says  in  Luke 
24:50,  where  he  does  not  say  that  Jesus  led  them  all  the  way 
to  Bethany. 

13.  Into  the  upper  chamber  (eis  to  huperoion).  The  upstairs 
or  upper  room  (huper  is  upper  or  over,  the  adjective  huper- 
oios),  the  room  upstairs  where  the  women  staid  in  Homer, 
then  a  room  up  under  the  flat  roof  for  retirement  or  prayer 
(Acts  9:37,  39),  sometimes  a  large  third  story  room  suitable 
for  gatherings  (Acts  20:9).  It  is  possible,  even  probable, 
that  this  is  the  "large  upper  room"  {anogeon  mega)  of 
Mark  14:15  =Luke  22:12,  The  Vulgate  has  coenaculum  for 
both  words.  The  word  is  used  in  the  N.T  only  in  Acts. 
It  was  in  a  private  house  as  in  Luke  22:11  and  not  in  the 
temple  as  Luke  24:53  might  imply,  "continually"  {dia 
pantos)  these  words  probably  meaning  on  proper  occasions. 
They  were  abiding  {esan  katamenontes).  Periphrastic  im- 
perfect active.  Perfective  use  of  kata,  to  abide  permanently. 
It  is  possible  that  this  is  the  house  of  Mary  the  mother  of 
John  Mark  where  the  disciples  later  met  for  prayer  (Acts 
12:12).  Here  alone  in  the  N.T.,  though  old  compound. 
Some  MSB.  here  read  paramenontes.  This  could  mean  con- 
stant residence,  but  most  likely  frequent  resort  for  prayer 
during  these  days,  some  being  on  hand  all  the  time  as  they 
came  and  went.  Simon  the  Zealot  {Simon  ho  Zelotes).  Called 
Simon  the  Cananaean  {ho  Cananaios)  in  Matt.  10:4,  Mark 
3:18,  but  Zealot  in  Luke  6:16  as  here  giving  the  Greek 
equivalent  of  the  Aramaic  word  because  Luke  has  Gentiles 
in  mind.  The  epithet  (member  of  the  party  of  Zealots) 
clung  to  him  after  he  became  an  apostle  and  distinguishes 
him  from  Simon  Peter.  See  Vol.  I  on  the  Gospel  of  Matthew 
for  discussion  of  the  four  lists  of  the  apostles.  Judas  the  son 
of  James  {Joudas  lakobou).  Literally,  Judas  of  James, 
whether  son  or  brother  (cf.  Jude  1:1)  we  do  not  really  know. 


14        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

"Of  James"  is  added  to  distinguish  him  from  Judas  Is- 
cariot  (John  14:22).  However  we  take  it,  he  must  be  identi- 
fied with  the  Thaddaeus  (  =  Lebbaeus)  of  Mark  and  Matthew 
to  make  the  Hst  in  the  third  group  identical.  No  name  ap- 
pears in  Acts  for  that  of  Judas  Iscariot. 

14.  fFith  one  accord  {homothumadon) .  Old  adverb  in 
-don  from  adjective  homothumos  and  that  from  homos,  same, 
and  thumos,  mind  or  spirit,  with  the  same  mind  or  spirit. 
Common  in  ancient  Greek  and  papyri.  In  the  N.T.  eleven 
times  in  Acts  and  nowhere  else  save  Rom.  15:6.  See  Matt. 
18:19.  Continued  {esan  proskarterountes).  Periphrastic 
imperfect  active  of  proskartereo,  old  verb  from  pros  (per- 
fective use)  and  kartereo  from  karteros,  strong,  steadfast, 
like  the  English  "carry  on."  Already  in  Mark  3:9  which 
see  and  several  times  in  Acts  and  Paul's  Epistles.  They 
"stuck  to"  the  praying  {tei  proseuchei,  note  article)  for 
the  promise  of  the  Father  till  the  answer  came.  fVith  the 
women  {sun  gunaixin).  Associative  instrumental  case  plural 
of  gune  after  sun.  As  one  would  expect  when  praying  was 
the  chief  work  on  hand.  More  women  certainly  included 
than  in  Luke  8:2;  Mark  1 5 :4of .  =  Matt.  27:55f.  =Luke 
23:49;  Mark  i5:47  =  Matt.  27:61  =Luke  23:55^;  Mark 
l6:i=Matt.  28:1;  Luke  24:if.  =John  20:1,  11-18;  Matt. 
28:9f.  There  were  probably  other  women  also  whose  testi- 
mony was  no  longer  scouted  as  it  had  been  at  first.  Codex 
Bezae  adds  here  "and  children."  And  Mary  the  mother  of 
Jesus  {kaiMariam  tei  metri  tou  lesou).  A  delicate  touch  by 
Luke  that  shows  Mary  with  her  crown  of  glory  at  last. 
She  had  come  out  of  the  shadow  of  death  with  the  song  in 
her  heart  and  with  the  realization  of  the  angel's  promise 
and  the  prophecy  of  Simeon.  It  was  a  blessed  time  for  Mary. 
With  his  brethren  {sun  tois  adelphois  autou).  With  his  broth- 
ers, it  should  be  translated.  They  had  once  disbelieved 
in  him  (John  7:5).  Jesus  had  appeared  to  James  (I  Cor. 
15:7)  and  now  it  is  a  happy  family  of  believers  including  the 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  IS 

mother    and    brothers    (half-brothers,    literally)    of   Jesus, 
They  continue  in  prayer  for  the  power  from  on  high. 

15.  Brethren  (adelphon).  Codex  Bezae  has  "disciples." 
Multitude  of  persons  {ochlos  onomatoii).  Literally,  multi- 
tude of  names.  This  Hebraistic  use  of  onoma  =  person  occurs 
in  the  LXX  (Numb.  1:2;  18:20;  3:40,  43;  26:53)  and  in  Rev. 
3:4;  11:13.  Together  (epi  to  auto).  The  word  "gathered" 
is  not  in  the  Greek  here,  but  it  does  occur  in  Matt.  22:34 
and  that  is  undoubtedly  the  idea  in  Luke  17:35  as  in  Acts 
2:1,  44,  47;  I  Cor.  11:20;  14:23.  So  also  here.  They  were 
in  the  same  place  (to  auto).  About  a  hundred  and  twenty 
(hos  hekaton  eikosi).  A  crowd  for  "the  upper  room."  No 
special  significance  in  the  number  120,  just  the  number 
there. 

16.  Brethren  {andres  adelphoi).  Literally,  men,  brethren 
or  brother  men.  More  dignified  and  respectful  than  just 
"brethren."  Demosthenes  sometimes  said  Andres  Athe- 
naioi.  Cf.  our  "gentlemen  and  fellow-citizens."  Women 
are  included  in  this  address  though  andres  refers  only  to  men. 
It  was  needful  (edei).  Imperfect  tense  of  the  impersonal 
dei  with  the  infinitive  clause  (first  aorist  passive)  and  the 
accusative  of  general  reference  as  a  loose  subject.  Peter 
here  assumes  that  Jesus  is  the  Messiah  and  finds  scripture 
illustrative  of  the  treachery  of  Judas.  He  applies  it  to 
Judas  and  quotes  the  two  passages  in  verse  20  (Psa.  69:25; 
Psa.  109:8).  The  Holy  Spirit  has  not  yet  come  upon  them, 
but  Peter  feels  moved  to  interpret  the  situation.  He  feels 
that  his  mind  is  opened  by  Jesus  (Luke  24:45).  It  is  a  logi- 
cal, not  a  moral,  necessity  that  Peter  points  out.  Peter 
here  claims  the  Holy  Spirit  as  speaking  in  the  scriptures 
as  he  does  in  II  Peter  1:21.  His  description  of  Judas  as 
"guide"  (hodegou)  to  those  who  seized  (sullabousin)  Jesus 
is  that  of  the  base  traitor  that  he  was.  This  very  verb  oc- 
curs in  Luke  22:54  of  the  arrest  of  Jesus. 

17.  Was  numbered  {katerithmenos  en).    Periphrastic  past 


l6        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

perfect  passive  indicative  of  katarithmeo,  old  verb,  but  here 
only  in  the  N.T.  (perfective  use  of  kata).  Received  his  por- 
tion {elacken  ion  kleron).  Second  aorist  active  indicative  of 
lagchano,  old  verb,  to  obtain  by  lot  as  in  Luke  i  :9  and  John 
19:24,  especially  by  divine  appointment  as  here  and  II  Peter 
2:1.  Kleros  also  means  lot,  an  object  used  in  casting  lots 
(Acts  1:26),  or  what  Is  obtained  by  lot  as  here  and  8:21,  of 
eternal  salvation  (Acts  26:18;  Col.  1:12),  of  persons  chosen 
by  divine  appointment  (I  Peter  5:3).  From  this  latter  usage 
the*  Latin  cleros,  clericus,  our  clergy,  one  chosen  by  divine 
lot.  So  Peter  says  that  Judas  "obtained  by  lot  the  lot  of 
this  ministry"  (diakonias)  which  he  had  when  he  betrayed 
Jesus.  The  Master  chose  him  and  gave  him  his  opportunity. 

18.  Now  this  man  (Houtos  men  oun).  Note  men  oun 
again  without  a  corresponding  de  as  in  i  :6.  Verses  18  and  19 
are  a  long  parenthesis  of  Luke  by  way  of  explanation  of  the 
fate  of  Judas.  In  verse  20  Peter  resumes  and  quotes  the 
scripture  to  which  he  referred  In  verse  16.  Obtained  {ekte- 
sato).  First  aorist  middle  Indicative  of  ktaomai,  to  acquire, 
only  in  the  middle,  to  get  for  oneself.  With  the  covenant 
money  for  the  betrayal,  acquired  it  Indirectly  apparently 
according  to  Matt.  26:14-16;  27:3-8  which  see.  Falling 
headlong  {prenes  genomenos).  Attic  form  usually  pranes. 
The  word  means,  not  "headlong,"  but  "flat  on  the  face"  as 
opposed  to  huptios  on  the  back  (Hackett).  Hackett  ob- 
serves that  the  place  suits  admirably  the  Idea  that  Judas 
hung  himself  (Matt.  27:5)  and,  the  rope  breaking,  fell  flat 
on  his  face  and  burst  asunder  in  the  midst  {elakesen  mesos). 
First  aorist  active  indicative  of  laskb  old  verb  (here  only  in 
the  N.T.),  to  clang,  to  crack,  to  crash,  like  a  falling  tree. 
Aristophanes  uses  it  of  crashing  bones.  Mesos  Is  predicate 
nominative  referring  to  Judas.  Gushed  out  (exechuthe). 
First  aorist  passive  indicative  of  ekcheo,  to  pour  out. 

19.  Language  {dialektoi).  Not  a  dialect  of  the  Greek, 
but  a  dlfl^erent  language,  the  Aramaic.    So  also  In  2:6;  21 :40. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  17 

Dialektos  is  from  dialegomai,  to  converse,  to  speak  between 
two  (dia).  Akeldama  {Hakeldamach).  This  Aramaic  word 
Peter  explains  as  "the  field  of  blood."  Two  traditions  are 
preserved:  one  in  Matt.  27:7  which  explains  that  the  priests 
purchased  this  potter's  field  with  the  money  which  Judas 
flung  down  as  the  price  of  the  blood  of  Jesus.  The  other  in 
Acts  describes  it  as  the  field  of  blood  because  Judas  poured 
out  his  blood  there.  Hackett  and  Knowling  argue  that  both 
views  can  be  true.  "The  ill-omened  name  could  be  used 
with  a  double  emphasis"  (Hackett). 

20.  For  it  is  written  {gegraptai  gar).  Luke  here  returns  to 
the  address  of  Peter  interrupted  by  verses  18  and  19.  Perfect 
passive  indicative,  the  usual  idiom  in  quoting  scripture, 
stands  written.  Psalm  69  is  often  quoted  as  Messianic  in 
Matthew  and  John.  His  habitation  {he  epaulis  auiou).  Only 
here  in  the  N.T.,  a  country  house,  cottage,  cabin.  His  office 
{ten  episkopen  autou).  Our  word  bishopric  (Authorized 
Version)  is  from  this  word,  office  of  bishop  {episcopos). 
Only  that  is  not  the  idea  here,  but  over-seership  {epi,  skopeo) 
or  office  as  in  I  Peter  2:12.  It  means  to  visit  and  to  inspect, 
to  look  over.    The  ecclesiastical  sense  comes  later  (I  Tim. 

3:1). 

21.  Must  {dei).  Present  necessity  corresponding  to  the 
old  necessity  {edei)  about  Judas  (verse  16).  This  sentence 
in  verses  21  and  22  begins  with  dei.  That  {hoi).  Locative 
case  of  the  relative  attracted  to  the  case  of  the  antecedent. 
Went  in  and  went  out  {eiselthen  kai  exelthen).  Constative 
aorist  active.  With  us  {epW  hemas).  Over  us,  the  margin 
has  it.  But  the  full  phrase  would  be  epW  hemas  kai  aph* 
hemon.    He  came  to  us  and  went  from  us  (Knowling). 

22.  Beginning  {arxamenos).  Aorist  middle  participle  of 
archoy  agreeing  {nominative)  with  ho  kurios  I e sous  (the  Lord 
Jesus).  The  ministry  of  Jesus  began  with  the  ministry  of 
John.  Strictly  speaking  arxamenos  should  be  the  accusative 
and  agree  with  martura  (witness)  in  verse  22,  but  the  con- 


1 8        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

struction  is  a  bit  free.  The  ministry  of  Jesus  began  with  the 
baptism  of  John  and  lasted  until  the  Ascension.  A  witness 
with  us  of  his  resurrection  {martura  tes  anastaseos  autou  sun 
hemin).  This  Peter  considers  the  essential  thing  in  a  suc- 
cessor to  Judas.  The  one  chosen  should  be  a  personal  witness 
who  can  speak  from  his  own  experience  of  the  ministry, 
resurrection,  and  ascension  of  the  Lord  Jesus.  One  can 
easily  see  that  this  qualification  will  soon  put  an  end  to 
those  who  bear  such  personal  testimony. 

23.  They  put  forward  two  {estesan  duo).  First  aorist  active 
indicative  (transitive)  of  histemi  (not  intransitive  second 
aorist,  though  same  form  in  the  third  person  plural).  Some- 
body nominated  two  names,  Justus  and  Matthias. 

24.  Show  us  the  one  whom  thou  hast  chosen  (anadeixon  hon 
exelexo).  First  aorist  active  imperative  of  anadeiknumi, 
to  show  up,  make  plain.  First  aorist  middle  indicative 
second  person  singular  of  eklegb,  to  pick  out,  choose,  select. 
In  this  prayer  they  assume  that  God  has  made  a  choice. 
They  only  wish  to  know  his  will.  They  call  God  the  heart- 
searcher  or  heart-knower  {kardiognosta,  vocative  singular), 
a  late  word,  here  and  Acts  15:8  only  in  the  N.T.  Modem 
physicians  have  delicate  apparatus  for  studying  the  human 
heart. 

25.  Apostleship  (apostoles).  Jesus  had  called  the  twelve 
apostles.  An  old  word  for  sending  away,  then  for  a  release, 
then  the  office  and  dignity  of  an  apostle  (Acts  1:25;  Rom. 
1:5;  I  Cor.  9:2;  Gal.  2:8).  To  his  own  place  (eis  ton  topon 
ton  idion).  A  bold  and  picturesque  description  of  the  destiny 
of  Judas  worthy  of  Dante's  Inferno.  There  is  no  doubt  in 
Peter's  mind  of  the  destiny  of  Judas  nor  of  his  own  guilt. 
He  made  ready  his  own  berth  and  went  to  it. 

26.  He  was  numbered  (sunkatepsephisthe) .  To  the  Jews 
the  lot  did  not  suggest  gambling,  but  "the  O.T.  method  of 
learning  the  will  of  Jehovah"  (Fumeaux).  The  two  nomina- 
tions made  a  decision  necessary  and  they  appealed  to  God 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  19 

in  this  way.  This  double  compound  sunkatapsephizo  occurs 
here  alone  In  the  N.T.  and  elsewhere  only  in  Plutarch 
{Them.  21)  in  the  middle  voice  for  condemning  with  others. 
Sunpsephizo  occurs  in  the  middle  voice  in  Acts  19:19  for 
counting  up  money  and  also  in  Aristophanes.  Psephizo 
with  dapanen  occurs  in  Luke  14:28  for  counting  the  cost  and 
in  Rev.  13:18  for  "counting"  the  number  of  the  beast.  The 
ancients  used  pebbles  (psephoi)  in  voting,  black  for  con- 
demning, white  (Rev.  2:17)  in  acquitting.  Here  it  is  used  in 
much  the  same  sense  as  katarithmeo  in  verse  17. 


CHAPTER   II 

1.  fVas  now  come  {en  toi  sunplerousthai).  Luke's  favourite 
idiom  of  en  with  the  articular  present  infinitive  passive  and 
the  accusative  of  general  reference,  "in  the  being  fulfilled 
completely  (perfective  use  of  sun-)  as  to  the  day  of  Pente- 
cost." Common  verb,  but  only  in  Luke  in  N.T.  In  literal 
sense  of  filling  a  boat  in  Luke  8:23,  about  days  in  Luke  9:51 
as  here.  Whether  the  disciples  expected  the  coming  of  the 
Holy  Spirit  on  this  day  we  do  not  know.  Blass  holds  that 
the  present  tense  shows  that  the  day  had  not  yet  come.  It 
is  a  Hebrew  idiom  (Ex.  7:25)  and  Luke  may  mean  that  the 
day  of  Pentecost  was  not  yet  over,  was  still  going  on,  though 
Hackett  takes  it  for  the  interval  (fifty  days)  between  Pass- 
over and  Pentecost.  Apparently  this  day  of  Pentecost  fell 
on  the  Jewish  Sabbath  (our  Saturday).  It  was  the  feast  of 
first  fruits.  All  together  in  one  place  {pantes  homou  epi  to 
auto).  All  together  in  the  same  place.  Note  homou  here 
(correct  text),  not  homothumadon  as  in  1:14,  and  so  a  bit  of 
tautology. 

2.  Suddenly  (aphno).  Old  adverb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only 
in  Acts  (2:2;  16:26;  28:6).  Kin  to  exaiphnes  (Acts  22:61). 
A  sound  (echos).  Our  echo.  Old  word,  already  in  Luke  4:37 
for  rumour  and  Luke  21 :25  for  the  roar  of  the  sea.  It  was  not 
wind,  but  a  roar  or  reverberation  "as  of  the  rushing  of  a 
mighty  wind"  {hosper  pheromenes  pnoes  biaias).  This  is 
not  a  strict  translation  nor  is  it  the  genitive  absolute.  It 
was  "an  echoing  sound  as  of  a  mighty  wind  borne  violently" 
(or  rushing  along  like  the  whirr  of  a  tornado).  Pnoe  (wind) 
is  used  here  (in  the  X.T.  only  here  and  17:25  though  old 
word)  probably  because  of  the  use  of  pneuma  in  verse  4  of 
the  Holy  Spirit.    In  John  3  :5-8  pneuma  occurs  for  both  wind 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  21 

and  Spirit.  Filled  (eplerosen).  "As  a  bath  is  filled  with 
water,  that  they  might  be  baptized  with  the  Holy  Ghost, 
in  fulfilment  of  Acts  1:5"  (Canon  Cook).  They  were  sitting 
(esan  kathemenoi).  Periphrastic  imperfect  middle  of  kath- 
emai. 

3.  Parting  asunder  {diamerizomenai) .  Present  middle  (or 
passive)  participle  of  diamerizd,  old  verb,  to  cleave  asunder, 
to  cut  in  pieces  as  a  butcher  does  meat  (aorist  passive  in 
Luke  ii'.iyf.).  So  middle  here  would  mean,  parting  them- 
selves asunder  or  distributing  themselves.  The  passive 
voice  would  be  "being  distributed."  The  middle  is  probably 
correct  and  means  that  "the  fire-like  appearance  presented 
itself  at  first,  as  it  were,  in  a  single  body,  and  then  suddenly 
parted  in  this  direction  and  that;  so  that  a  portion  of  it 
rested  on  each  of  those  present"  (Hackett).  The  idea  is  not 
that  each  tongue  was  cloven,  but  each  separate  tongue 
looked  like  fire,  not  real  fire,  but  looking  like  {hosei,  as  if) 
fire.  The  audible  sign  is  followed  by  a  visible  one  (Know- 
ling).  "Fire  had  always  been,  with  the  Jews,  the  symbol 
of  the  Divine  presence  (cf.  Ex.  3:2;  Deut.  5:4).  No  symbol 
could  be  more  fitting  to  express  the  Spirit's  purifying  energy 
and  refining  energy"  (Furneaux).  The  Baptist  had  pre- 
dicted a  baptizing  by  the  Messiah  in  the  Holy  Spirit  and  in 
fire  (Matt.  3:11).  It  sat  (ekathisen).  Singular  verb  here, 
though  plural  opthesan  with  tongues  (glossat).  A  tongue 
that  looked  like  fire  sat  upon  each  one. 

4.  With  other  tongues  {heterais  glossais).  Other  than  their 
native  tongues.  Each  one  began  to  speak  in  a  language  that 
he  had  not  acquired  and  yet  it  was  a  real  language  and 
understood  by  those  from  various  lands  familiar  with  them. 
It  was  not  jargon,  but  intelligible  language.  Jesus  had  said 
that  the  gospel  was  to  go  to  all  the  nations  and  here  the 
various  tongues  of  earth  were  spoken.  One  might  conclude 
that  this  was  the  way  in  which  the  message  was  to  be  car- 
ried to  the  nations,  but  future  developments  disprove  it. 


22         WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

This  is  a  third  miracle  (the  sound,  the  tongues  like  fire,  the 
untaught  languages).  There  is  no  blinking  the  fact  that 
Luke  so  pictures  them.  One  need  not  be  surprised  if  this 
occasion  marks  the  fulfilment  of  the  Promise  of  the  Father. 
But  one  is  not  to  confound  these  miraculous  signs  with  the 
Holy  Spirit.  They  are  merely  proof  that  he  has  come  to 
carry  on  the  work  of  his  dispensation.  The  gift  of  tongues 
came  also  on  the  house  of  Cornelius  at  Caesarea  (Acts  10:44- 
47;  11:15-17),  the  disciples  of  John  at  Ephesus  (Acts  19:6), 
the  disciples  at  Corinth  (I  Cor.  14:1-33).  It  is  possible  that 
the  gift  appeared  also  at  Samaria  (Acts  8:18).  But  it  was  not 
a  general  or  a  permanent  gift.  Paul  explains  in  I  Cor.  14:22 
that  "tongues"  were  a  sign  to  unbelievers  and  were  not  to 
be  exercised  unless  one  was  present  who  understood  them 
and  could  translate  them.  This  restriction  disposes  at  once 
of  the  modern  so-called  tongues  which  are  nothing  but 
jargon  and  hysteria.  It  so  happened  that  here  on  this 
occasion  at  Pentecost  there  were  Jews  from  all  parts  of  the 
world,  so  that  some  one  would  understand  one  tongue  and 
some  another  without  an  interpreter  such  as  was  needed  at 
Corinth.  The  experience  is  identical  in  all  four  instances 
and  they  are  not  for  edification  or  instruction,  but  for  adora- 
tion and  wonder  and  worship.  As  the  Spirit  gave  them  utter- 
ance {kathos  to  pneuma  edidou  apophtheggesthai  autois). 
This  is  precisely  what  Paul  claims  in  I  Cor.  12:10,  28,  but  all 
the  same  without  an  interpreter  the  gift  was  not  to  be 
exercised  (I  Cor.  14:6-19).  Paul  had  the  gift  of  tongues, 
but  refused  to  exercise  it  except  as  it  would  be  understood. 
Note  the  imperfect  tense  here  (edidou).  Perhaps  they  did 
not  all  speak  at  once,  but  one  after  another.  Apophtheg- 
gesthai is  a  late  verb  (LXX  of  prophesying,  papyri).  Lucian 
uses  it  of  the  ring  of  a  vessel  when  it  strikes  a  reef.  It  is 
used  of  eager,  elevated,  impassioned  utterance.  In  the  N.T. 
only  here,  verse  14  and  26:25.  Apophthegm  is  from  this 
verb. 


THE  ACTS   OF  THE  APOSTLES  23 

5.  Were  dwelling  {esan  katoikountes).  Periphrastic  im- 
perfect active  indicative.  Usually  katoiked  means  residence 
in  a  place  (4:16;  7:24;  9:22,  32)  as  inverse  14  (Luke  13:4). 
Perhaps  some  had  come  to  Jerusalem  to  live  while  others 
were  here  only  temporarily,  for  the  same  word  occurs  in  verse 
9  of  those  who  dwell  in  Mesopotamia,  etc.  Devout  (eulabeis). 
Reverent  (eu,  well,  lamhano,  to  take).  See  on  Luke  2:25  like 
Simeon  waiting  for  the  consolation  of  Israel  or  hoping  to  die 
and  be  buried  in  the  Holy  City  and  also  Acts  8:2. 

6.  When  this  sound  was  heard  {genomenes  tes  phones 
tautes).  Genitive  absolute  with  aorist  middle  participle. 
Note  phone  this  time,  not  echo  as  in  verse  i.  Phone  origi- 
nally meant  sound  as  of  the  wind  (John  3 :8)  or  an  instru- 
ment (I  Cor.  14:7,  8,  10),  then  voice  of  men.  The  meaning 
seems  to  be  that  the  excited  "other  tongues"  of  verse  4  were 
so  loud  that  the  noise  drew  the  crowd  together.  The  house 
where  the  120  were  may  have  been  (Hackett)  on  one  of  the 
avenues  leading  to  the  temple.  Were  confounded  (sune- 
chuthe).  First  aorist  passive  indicative  of  suncheo  or  sun- 
chuno,  to  pour  together  precisely  like  the  Latin  confundo, 
to  confound.  The  Vulgate  has  it  mente  confusa  est.  It  is  an 
old  verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  in  Acts  five  times  (2:6;  9:22; 
19:32;  21:27,  31).  In  his  own  language  (tei  ididi  dialektbi). 
Locative  case.  Each  one  could  understand  his  own  language 
when  he  heard  that.  Every  one  that  came  heard  somebody 
speaking  in  his  native  tongue. 

7.  Were  amazed  (existanto).  Imperfect  middle  of  existemi, 
to  stand  out  of  themselves,  wide-open  astonishment.  Mar- 
velled (ethaumazon) .  Imperfect  active.  The  wonder  grew 
and  grew.  Galileans  (Galilaioi).  There  were  few  followers  of 
Jesus  as  yet  from  Jerusalem.  The  Galileans  spoke  a  rude 
Aramaic  (Mark  14:70)  and  probably  crude  Greek  vernacular 
also.  They  were  not  strong  on  language  and  yet  these  are 
the  very  people  who  now  show  such  remarkable  linguistic 
powers.    These  people  who  have  come  together  are  all  Jews 


24        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

and  therefore  know  Aramaic  and  the  vernacular  Koines 
but  there  were  various  local  tongues  "wherein  we  were 
bom"  {en  hei  egennethemen).  An  example  is  the  Lycaonian 
(Acts  14:11).  These  Galilean  Christians  are  now  heard 
speaking  these  various  local  tongues.  The  lists  in  verses 
9-1 1  are  not  linguistic,  but  geographical  and  merely  illus- 
trate how  widespread  the  Dispersion  {Diaspora)  of  the 
Jews  was  as  represented  on  this  occasion.  Jews  were  every- 
where, these  "Jews  among  the  nations"  (Acts  21:21).  Page 
notes  four  main  divisions  here:  (i)  The  Eastern  or  Babylo- 
nian, like  the  Parthians,  Medes,  Elamites,  Mesopotamians. 
(2)  The  Syriaji  like  Judea,  Cappadocia,  Pontus,  Asia, 
Phrygia,  Pamphylia.  (3)  The  Egyptian  like  Egypt,  Libya, 
Cyrene.  (4)  The  Roman.  Jews  and  proselytes  {proselutoi). 
These  last  from  proserchomai,  to  come  to,  to  join,  Gentile 
converts  to  Judaism  (circumcision,  baptism,  sacrifice). 
This  proselyte  baptism  was  immersion  as  is  shown  by  I. 
Abrahams  (Studies  in  Pharisaism  and  the  Gospels,  p.  38). 
Many  remained  uncircumcised  and  were  called  proselytes 
of  the  gate. 

11.  Cretes  and  Arabians.  These  two  groups  "seem  to  have 
been  added  to  the  list  as  an  afterthought"  (Knowling). 
Crete  is  an  island  to  itself  and  Arabia  was  separate  also 
though  near  Judea  and  full  of  Jews.  The  point  is  not  that 
each  one  of  these  groups  of  Jews  spoke  a  different  language, 
but  that  wherever  there  was  a  local  tongue  they  heard  men 
speaking  in  it.  We  do  hear  them  speaking  {akouomen  la- 
lountbn  auton).  Genitive  case  auton  with  akouo  the  participle 
lalounton  agreeing  with  auton,  a  sort  of  participial  idiom  of 
indirect  discourse  (Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  i04off.).  The 
mighty  works  {ta  megaleia).  Old  adjective  for  magnificent.  In 
LXX,  but  only  here  (not  genuine  in  Luke  i  :49)  in  the  N.T. 
Cf.  II  Peter  1:16  for  megaleiotes  (majesty). 

12.  Were  perplexed  {dieporounto).  Imperfect  middle  of 
diaporeb  {dia,  a  privative,  poros)  to  be  wholly  at  a  loss.   Old 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  25 

verb,  but  in  N.T.  only  in  Luke  and  Acts.  They  continued 
amazed  {existanto)  and  puzzled.  What  meaneth  this?  {Ti 
thelei  touto  einai).    Literally,  what  does  this  wish  to  be.^ 

13.  Mocking  {diachleuazontes).  Old  verb,  but  only  here 
in  the  N.T.,  though  the  simple  verb  (without  dia)  in  17:32. 
Chleue  means  a  joke.  With  new  wine  (gleukous) .  Sweet  wine, 
but  intoxicating.  Sweet  wine  kept  a  year  was  very  intoxi- 
cating. Genitive  case  here  after  memestomenoi  eisin  (peri- 
phrastic perfect  passive  indicative),  old  verb  mestoo,  only 
here  in  the  N.T.   Tanked  up  with  new  wine,  state  of  fulness. 

14.  Standing  up  with  the  eleven  {statheis  sun  tois  hendeka). 
Took  his  stand  with  the  eleven  including  Matthias,  who 
also  rose  up  with  them,  and  spoke  as  their  spokesman,  a 
formal  and  impressive  beginning.  The  Codex  Bezae  has 
"ten  apostles."  Luke  is  fond  of  this  pictorial  use  of  statheis 
(first  aorist  passive  participle  of  histemi)  as  seen  nowhere 
else  in  the  N.T.  (Luke  18:11,  40;  19:8;  Acts  5:20;  17:22; 
27:21).  Lifted  up  his  voice  {eperen  ten  phonen  autou).  This 
phrase  only  in  Luke  in  the  N.T.  (Luke  11:29;  Acts  2:14; 
14:11;  22:22),  but  is  common  in  the  old  writers.  First  aorist 
active  indicative  of  epairo.  The  large  crowd  and  the  con- 
fusion of  tongues  demanded  loud  speaking.  "This  most 
solemn,  earnest,  yet  sober  speech"  (Bengel).  Codex  Bezae 
adds  "first"  after  "voice."  Peter  did  it  to  win  and  hold 
attention.  Give  ear  unto  my  words  {enotisasthe  ta  rhemata 
mou).  Late  verb  in  LXX  and  only  here  in  the  N.T.  First 
aorist  middle  from  enotizomai  (en,  ous,  ear)  to  give  ear  to, 
receive  into  the  ear.  People's  ears  differ  greatly,  but  in 
public  speech  they  have  to  be  reached  through  the  ear. 
That  puts  an  obligation  on  the  speaker  and  also  on  the 
auditors  who  should  sit  where  they  can  hear  with  the  ears 
which  they  have,  an  obligation  often  overlooked. 

15.  As  ye  suppose  {hos  humeis  hupolamhanete) .  Note  use 
of  humeis  (ye)  for  decided  emphasis.  The  third  hour  {hora 
trite).    Three  o'clock  in  the  day  Jewish  time,  nine  Roman. 


26        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Drunkenness  belongs  to  the  night  (I  Thess.  57).  It  was  a 
quick,  common  sense  reply,  and  complete  answer  to  their 
suspicion. 

16.  This  is  that  which  hath  been  spoken  by  the  prophet  Joel 
{touto  estin  to  eiremenon  dia  tou  prophetou  I  del).  Positive 
interpretation  of  the  supernatural  phenomena  in  the  light 
of  the  Messianic  prophecy  of  Joel  2:28-32.  Peter's  mind 
is  now  opened  by  the  Holy  Spirit  to  understand  the  Mes- 
sianic prophecy  and  the  fulfilment  right  before  their  eyes. 
Peter  now  has  spiritual  insight  and  moral  courage.  The 
power  (dunamis)  of  the  Holy  Spirit  has  come  upon  him  as  he 
proceeds  to  give  the  first  interpretation  of  the  life  and  work 
of  Jesus  Christ  since  his  Ascension.  It  is  also  the  first  formal 
apology  for  Christianity  to  a  public  audience.  Peter  rises 
to  the  height  of  his  powers  in  this  remarkable  sermon. 
Jesus  had  foretold  that  he  would  be  a  Rock  and  now  he  is 
no  longer  shale,  but  a  solid  force  for  aggressive  Christianity. 
He  follows  here  In  verses  17  to  21  closely  the  LXX  text  of 
Joel  and  then  applies  the  passage  to  the  present  emergency 
(22-24). 

17.  In  the  last  days  {en  tais  eschatais  hemerais).  Joel 
does  not  have  precisely  these  words,  but  he  defines  "those 
days"  as  being  "the  day  of  the  Lord"  (cf.  Isa.  2:2;  Micah 
4:1).  /  will  pour  forth  {ekched).  Future  active  indicative  of 
ekcheo.  This  future  like  edomai  and  piomai  is  without  tense 
sign,  probably  like  the  present  In  the  futuristic  sense  (Robert- 
son, Grammar,  p.  354).  Westcott  and  Hort  put  a  different 
accent  on  the  future,  but  the  old  Greek  had  no  accent.  The 
old  Greek  had  ekcheuso.  This  verb  means  to  pour  out. 
Of  my  Spirit  (apo  tou  pneumatos) .  This  use  of  apo  (of)  is 
either  because  of  the  variety  in  the  manifestations  of  the 
Spirit  (I  Cor.  12)  or  because  the  Spirit  in  his  entirety  re- 
mains with  God  (Holtzmann,  Wendt).  But  the  Hebrew  has 
it:  "I  will  pour  out  my  Spirit"  without  the  partitive  idea 
in  the  LXX.  And  your  daughters  {kai  hai  thugateres  humon). 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  27 

Anna  is  called  a  prophetess  in  Luke  2:36  and  the  daughters 
of  Philip  prophesy  (Acts  21:9)  and  verse  18  (handmaidens). 
See  also  I  Cor,  11:5  {prophetousa).  Visions  {horaseis). 
Late  word  for  the  more  common  horama,  both  from  horaOy 
to  see.  In  Rev.  4:3  it  means  appearance,  but  in  Rev.  9:17 
as  here  an  ecstatic  revelation  or  vision.  Dream  dreams  {enu- 
pniois  enupniasthesontai) .  Shall  dream  with  (instrumental 
case)  dreams.  First  future  passive  of  enupniazo  from  en- 
upnios  (en  and  hupnos,  in  sleep),  a  common  late  word. 
Only  here  in  the  N.T.  (this  from  Joel  as  all  these  verses  17  to 
21  are)  and  Jude  8.  Yea  and  {kai  ge).  Intensive  particle  ge 
added  to  kai  (and),  an  emphatic  addition  (  =  Hebrew  vegam). 
Servants  (doulous),  handmaidens  (doulas).  Slaves,  actual 
slaves  of  men.  The  humblest  classes  will  receive  the  Spirit 
of  God  (cf.  I  Cor.  1:26-31).  But  the  word  "prophesy" 
here  is  not  in  the  LXX  (or  the  Hebrew). 

19.  Wonders  [terata).  Apparently  akin  to  the  verb  tereo, 
to  watch  like  a  wonder  in  the  sky,  miracle  {miraculum)^ 
marvel,  portent.  In  the  New  Testament  the  word  occurs 
only  in  the  plural  and  only  in  connection  with  semeia  (signs) 
as  here  and  in  verse  43.  But  signs  {semeia)  here  is  not  in  the 
LXX.  See  on  Matt.  1 1 :20.  In  verse  22  all  three  words 
occur  together:  powers,  wonders,  signs  (dunamesi,  terasi, 
semeiois).  Above  {and).  This  word  is  not  in  the  LXX  nor  is 
"beneath"  {kato),  both  probably  being  added  to  make 
clearer  the  contrast  between  heaven  and  earth.  Blood  and 
fire  and  vapour  of  smoke  {haima  kai  pur  kai  atmida  kapnou). 
A  chiasm  as  these  words  illustrate  bloodshed  and  destruction 
by  fire  as  signs  here  on  earth. 

20.  Shall  he  turned  {metastraphesetai).  Second  future 
passive  of  metastrepho,  common  verb,  but  only  three  times 
in  the  N.T.  (Acts  2:20  from  Joel;  James  4:9;  Gal.  1:7). 
These  are  the  "wonders"  or  portents  of  verse  19.  It  is 
worth  noting  that  Peter  interprets  these  "portents"  as 
fulfilled  on  the  Day  of  Pentecost,  though  no  such  change  of 


28        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

the  sun  into  darkness  or  of  the  moon  into  blood  is  recorded. 
Clearly  Peter  does  not  interpret  the  symbolism  of  Joel  in 
literal  terms.  This  method  of  Peter  may  be  of  some  service 
in  the  Book  of  Revelation  where  so  many  apocalyptic  sym- 
bols occur  as  well  as  in  the  great  Eschatological  Discourse 
of  Jesus  in  Matt.  24  and  25.  In  Matt.  24:6,  29  Jesus  had 
spoken  of  wars  on  earth  and  wonders  in  heaven.  Before 
the  day  of  the  Lord  come,  that  great  and  notable  day  (prin 
elthein  hemeran  kuriou  ten  megalen  kai  epiphane).  The  use 
of  prin  with  the  infinitive  and  the  accusative  of  general 
reference  is  a  regular  Greek  idiom.  The  use  of  the  adjec- 
tives with  the  article  is  also  good  Greek,  though  the  article 
is  not  here  repeated  as  in  1:25.  The  Day  of  the  Lord  is  a 
definite  conception  without  the  article.  Notable  {epiphane) 
is  the  same  root  as  epiphany  (epiphaneia)  used  of  the  Second 
Coming  of  Christ  (II  Thess.  2:8;  I  Tim.  6:14;  II  Tim.  4:1; 
Tit.  2:13).  It  translates  here  the  Hebrew  word  for  "terri- 
ble." In  the  Epistles  the  Day  of  the  Lord  is  applied  (Know- 
ling)  to  the  Coming  of  Christ  for  judgment  (I  Thess.  5:2; 
I  Cor.  1:8;  II  Cor.  1:14;  Phil.  1:10). 

21.  Shall  call  on  {epikalesetai).  First  aorist  middle  sub- 
junctive of  epikaleo,  common  verb,  to  call  to,  middle  voice 
for  oneself  in  need.  Indefinite  relative  clause  with  ean  and  so 
subjunctive,  punctiliar  idea,  in  any  single  case,  and  so  aorist. 

22.  Hear  these  words  (akousate  tous  logons  toutous).  Do  it 
now  (aorist  tense).  With  unerring  aim  Peter  has  found  the 
solution  for  the  phenomena.  He  has  found  the  key  to  God's 
work  on  this  day  in  his  words  through  Joel.  As  ye  your- 
selves know  (kathos  autoi  oidate).  Note  autoi  for  emphasis. 
Peter  calls  the  audience  to  witness  that  his  statements  are 
true  concerning  "Jesus  the  Nazarene."  He  wrought  his 
miracles  by  the  power  of  God  in  the  midst  of  these  very 
people  here  present. 

23.  Him  {touton).  "This  one,"  resumptive  and  emphatic 
object  of  "did  crucify  and  slay."    Being  delivered  up  {ekdo-

ton).  Verbal  adjective  from  ekdidomi,  to  give  out  or  over. 
Old  word,  but  here  only  in  the  N.T.  Delivered  up  by  Judas, 
Peter  means.  By  the  determinate  counsel  and  foreknowledge 
of  God  (tei  horismenei  boulei  kai  prognosei  tou  theou).  .  In- 
strumental case.  Note  both  purpose  (boule)  and  foreknowl- 
edge (prognosis)  of  God  and  "determined"  {hdris7nene,  per- 
fect passive  participle,  state  of  completion).  God  had  willed 
the  death  of  Jesus  (John  3:16)  and  the  death  of  Judas 
(Acts  i:i6),  but  that  fact  did  not  absolve  Judas  from  his 
responsibility  and  guilt  (Luke  22:22).  He  acted  as  a  free 
moral  agent.  By  the  hand  {dia  cheiros).  Luke  is  fond  of  these 
figures  (hand,  face,  etc.)  very  much  like  the  Hebrew  though 
the  vernacular  of  all  languages  uses  them.  Lawless  men 
(anomon).  Men  without  law,  who  recognize  no  law  for 
their  conduct,  like  men  in  high  and  low  stations  today  who 
defy  the  laws  of  God  and  man.  Old  word,  very  common  in 
the  LXX.  Ye  did  crucify  [prospexantes).  First  aorist  active 
participle  of  prospegnumi,  rare  compound  word  in  Dio 
Cassius  and  here  only  in  the  N.T.  One  must  supply  toi 
stauroi  and  so  it  means  "fastened  to  the  cross,"  a  graphic 
picture  like  Paul's  "nailed  to  the  cross"  (proselosas  toi 
stauroi)  in  Col.  2:14.  Did  slay  (aneilaie).  Second  aorist 
active  indicative  with  first  aorist  vowel  a  instead  of  0  as  is 
common  in  the  Koine.  This  verb  anaireo,  to  take  up,  is  often 
used  for  kill  as  in  Acts  12:2.  Note  Peter's  boldness  now 
under  the  power  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  He  charges  the  people 
to  their  faces  with  the  death  of  Christ. 

24.  God  raised  up  (ho  theos  anestesen).  Est  hoc  summum 
orationis  (Blass).  Apparently  this  is  the  first  public  procla- 
mation to  others  than  believers  of  the  fact  of  the  Resurrec- 
tion of  Jesus.  "At  a  time  it  was  still  possible  to  test  the 
statement,  to  examine  witnesses,  to  expose  fraud,  the  Apos- 
tle openly  proclaimed  the  Resurrection  as  a  fact,  needing 
no  evidence,  but  known  to  his  hearers"  (Furneaux).  The 
pangs  of  death  (tas  odinas  tou  thanatou).    Codex  Bezae  has 


30        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

"Hades"  instead  of  death.  The  LXX  has  odinas  tkanatou 
in  Psa.  18:4,  but  the  Hebrew  original  means  "snares"  or 
"traps"  or  "cords"  of  death  where  sheol  and  death  are 
personified  as  hunters  laying  snares  for  prey.  How  Peter 
or  Luke  came  to  use  the  old  Greek  word  odinas  (birth  pangs) 
we  do  not  know.  Early  Christian  writers  interpreted  the 
Resurrection  of  Christ  as  a  birth  out  of  death.  "Loosing" 
Qusas)  suits  better  the  notion  of  "snares"  held  a  prisoner 
by  death,  but  birth  pangs  do  bring  deliverance  to  the  mother 
also.  Because  {kaihoti).  This  old  conjunction  {kata,  hoti) 
occurs  in  the  N.T.  only  In  Luke's  writings.  That  he  should 
be  holden  {krateisthai  auton).  Infinitive  present  passive  with 
accusative  of  general  reference  and  subject  of  en  adunaton. 
The  figure  goes  with  "loosed"  {lusas)  above. 

25.  Concerning  him  {eis  auton).  Peter  interprets  Psa. 
16:8-11  as  written  by  David  and  with  reference  to  the  Mes- 
siah. There  is  but  one  speaker  in  this  Psalm  and  both  Peter 
here  and  Paul  In  Acts  13:36  make  it  the  Messiah.  David  is 
giving  his  own  experience  which  is  typical  of  the  Messiah 
(Knowling).  /  beheld  (prooromen).  Imperfect  middle  with- 
out augment  of  proorao,  common  verb,  but  only  twice  in  the 
N.T.,  to  see  beforehand  (Acts  21:29)  or  to  see  right  before 
one  as  here.  This  idea  of  pro-  is  made  plainer  by  "  before  my 
face"  {enopion  mou).  On  my  right  hand  {ek  dexibn  mou). 
The  Lord  Jehovah  like  a  defender  or  advocate  stands  at 
David's  right  hand  as  in  trials  In  court  (Psa.  109:31).  That 
{hina)  here  Is  almost  result.  Moved  (saleutho).  First  aorlst 
passive  subjunctive  of  jfl/^wo,  to  shake  like  an  earthquake. 

26.  Was  glad  (euphranthe).  First  aorlst  (timeless  here 
like  the  Hebrew  perfect)  passive  indicative  of  euphraino 
(cf.  Luke  15:32).  Timeless  also  Is  "rejoiced"  (egalliasato). 
Shall  dwell  {kataskenosei).  Shall  tabernacle,  pitch  a  tent, 
make  one's  abode  (cf.  Matt.  13:32).  See  on  Matt.  8:20 
about  kataskenoseis  (nests).  In  hope  {ep*  elpidi).  On  hope, 
the  hope  of  the  resurrection. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  31 

27.  In  Hades  {eis  Hdiden).  Hades  is  the  unseen  world, 
Hebrew  Sheol,  but  here  it  is  viewed  as  death  itself  "con- 
sidered as  a  rapacious  destroyer"  (Hackett).  It  does  not 
mean  the  place  of  punishment,  though  both  heaven  and  the 
place  of  torment  are  in  Hades  (Luke  16:23).  "Death  and 
Hades  are  strictly  parallel  terms:  he  who  is  dead  is  in  Hades" 
(Page).  The  use  of  eis  here  =  (fn  is  common  enough.  The 
Textus  Receptus  here  reads  eis  Hdidou  (genitive  case)  like 
the  Attic  idiom  with  domon  (abode)  understood.  "Hades" 
in  English  is  not  translation,  but  transliteration.  The  phrase 
in  the  Apostles'  Creed,  "descended  into  hell"  is  from  this 
passage  in  Acts  (Hades,  not  Gehenna).  The  English  word 
"hell"  is  Anglo-Saxon  from  helan,  to  hide,  and  was  used  in 
the  Authorized  Version  to  translate  both  Hades  as  here 
and  Gehenna  as  in  Matt.  5:22.  Thy  Holy  One  {ton  hosion 
sou).  Peter  applies  these  words  to  the  Messiah.  Corruption 
{diaphihoran).  The  word  can  mean  destruction  or  putre- 
faction from  diaphtheiro,  old  word,  but  in  N.T.  only  here 
and  Acts  13:34-37.  The  Hebrew  word  in  Psa.  16  can  mean 
also  the  pit  or  the  deep. 

28.  The  ways  of  life  {hodous  zoes).  Though  dead  God  will 
show  him  the  ways  back  to  life. 

29.  /  may  say  {exon  eipein).  Supply  estin  before  exon, 
periphrastic  present  indicative  of  exeimi,  to  allow,  permit. 
The  Authorized  Version  has  "Let  me  speak,"  supplying 
esto  present  imperative.  Freely  {meta  parresias).  Telling 
it  all  {pan,  rhesia  from  eipon,  to  speak),  with  fulness,  with 
boldness.  Luke  is  fond  of  the  phrase  (as  in  4:13).  It  is  a  new 
start  for  Simon  Peter,  full  of  boldness  and  courage.  The 
patriarch  {tou  patriarchou).  Transliteration  of  the  word, 
from  patria,  family,  and  archo,  to  rule,  the  founder  of  a  family. 
Late  word  in  LXX.  Used  of  Abraham  (Heb.  7:4),  of  the 
twelve  sons  of  Jacob  as  founders  of  the  several  tribes  (Acts 
7:8),  and  here  of  David  as  head  of  the  family  from  whom 
the    Messiah  comes.      fFas  buried  {etaphe).    Second    aorist 


32        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

passive  indicative  of  thapto.  His  tomb  was  on  Mt.  Zion 
where  most  of  the  kings  were  buried.  The  tomb  was  said 
to  have  fallen  into  ruins  in  the  time  of  the  Emperor 
Hadrian.  Josephus  (Ant.  XVI.  7,1)  attributes  most  of  the 
misfortunes  of  Herod's  family  to  the  fact  that  he  tried  to 
rifle  the  tomb  of  David. 

31.  Foreseeing  {proidbn).  Second  aorist  active  participle. 
Did  it  as  a  prophet.  Of  the  Christ  [tou  Christou).  Of  the 
Messiah.  See  under  verse  32.  This  is  a  definite  statement  by 
Peter  that  David  knew  that  in  Psalm  16  he  was  describing 
the  resurrection  of  the  Messiah. 

32.  This  Jesus  {touton  ton  lesoun).  Many  of  the  name 
"Jesus,"  but  he  means  the  one  already  called  "the  Naza- 
rene"  (verse  22)  and  foretold  as  the  Messiah  in  Psa.  16  and 
raised  from  the  dead  by  God  in  proof  that  he  is  the  Messiah 
(2:24,  32),  "this  Jesus  whom  ye  crucified"  (verse  36).  Other 
terms  used  of  him  in  the  Acts  are  the  Messiah,  verse  31, 
the  one  whom  God  "anointed"  (Acts  10:38),  as  in  John 
1:41,  Jesus  Christ  (9:34).  In  2:36  God  made  this  Jesus 
Messiah,  in  3:20  the  Messiah  Jesus,  in  17:3  Jesus  is  the 
Messiah,  in  18:5  the  Messiah  is  Jesus,  in  24:24  Christ  Jesus. 
Whereof  (hou).  Or  "of  whom."  Either  makes  sense  and 
both  are  true.  Peter  claims  the  whole  120  as  personal  wit- 
nesses to  the  fact  of  the  Resurrection  of  Jesus  from  the  dead 
and  they  are  all  present  as  Peter  calls  them  to  witness  on  the 
point.  In  Galilee  over  500  had  seen  the  Risen  Christ  at  one 
time  (I  Cor.  15:6)  most  of  whom  were  still  living  when  Paul 
wrote.  Thus  the  direct  evidence  for  the  resurrection  of 
Jesus  piles  up  in  cumulative  force. 

33.  By  the  right  hand  of  God  {tei  dexidi  tou  theou).  This 
translation  makes  it  the  instrumental  case.  The  margin  has 
it  "at"  instead  of  "by,"  that  is  the  locative  case.  And  it 
will  make  sense  in  the  true  dative  case,  "to  the  right  hand 
of  God."  These  three  cases  came  to  have  the  same  form  in 
Greek.      Rom.   8:24  furnishes  another  illustration  of  like 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  33 

ambiguity  {tei  elpidi),  saved  by  hope,  in  hope,  or  for  hope. 
Usually  it  is  quite  easy  to  tell  the  case  when  the  form  is 
identical.  Exalted  (hupsotheis).  First  aorist  passive  partici- 
ple of  hupsooj  to  lift  up.  Here  both  the  literal  and  tropical 
sense  occurs.  Cf.  John  12:32.  The  promise  of  the  Holy  Spirit 
{ten  epaggelian  tou  pneumatos  tou  hagiou).  The  promise 
mentioned  in  i  -.4.  and  now  come  true,  consisting  in  the  Holy 
Spirit  "from  the  Father"  {para  tou  patros),  sent  by  the 
Father  and  by  the  Son  (John  15:26;  16:7).  See  also  Gal. 
3:14.  He  hath  poured  forth  {execheen).  Aorist  active  in- 
dicative of  ekcheo  the  verb  used  by  Joel  and  quoted  by  Peter 
already  in  verses  17  and  18.  Jesus  has  fulfilled  his  promise. 
This  which  ye  see  and  hear  {touto  ho  humeis  kai  hlepete  kai 
akouete).  This  includes  the  sound  like  the  rushing  wind,  the 
tongues  like  fire  on  each  of  them,  the  different  languages 
spoken  by  the  120.  "The  proof  was  before  their  eyes  in 
this  new  energy  from  heaven"  (Furneaux),  a  culminating 
demonstration  that  Jesus  was  the  Messiah. 

34.  Ascended  not  {ou — anehe).  It  is  more  emphatic  than 
that:  For  not  David  ascended  into  the  heavens.  Peter  quotes 
Psa.  1 10:1  as  proof.  No  passage  in  the  O.T.  is  so  constantly 
quoted  as  Messianic  as  this.  "St.  Peter  does  not  demand 
belief  upon  his  own  assertion,  but  he  again  appeals  to  the 
Scriptures,  and  to  words  which  could  not  have  received  a 
fulfilment  in  the  case  of  David"  (Knowling).  Sit  thou 
{kathou).  Late  Koine  form  for  earlier  katheso,  present  middle 
imperative  second  singular  of  kathemai. 

35.  Till  I  make  {heos  an  tho).  Second  aorist  active  sub- 
junctive of  tithemi  with  an  after  hebs  for  the  future,  a  com- 
mon Greek  idiom.  This  dominion  of  Christ  as  Mediator 
will  last  till  the  plan  of  the  kingdom  is  carried  out  (I  Cor. 
15:23-28).  Complete  subjugation  will  come,  perhaps  re- 
ferring to  the  custom  of  victorious  kings  placing  their  feet 
upon  the  necks  of  their  enemies  (Josh.  10:24).  Therefore 
assuredly  {Asphalbs  oun).    Assuredly  therefore,  without  any 


34        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

slip  or  trip  (asphales  from  a  privative  and  sphalloj  to  trip, 
to  slip.  Peter  draws  a  powerfully  pungent  conclusion  by 
the  use  of  the  adverb  asphalos  and  the  inferential  conjunc- 
tion oun.  Peter's  closing  sentence  drives  home  the  point  of 
his  sermon:  "This  very  Jesus  whom  ye  crucified  (note 
humets,  strongly  emphatic  ye),  him  God  made  both  Lord 
and  Messiah"  {kai  kurion  kai  Christon),  as  David  foretold 
in  Psa.  no  and  as  the  events  of  this  day  have  confirmed. 
The  critics  are  disturbed  over  how  Luke  could  have  gotten 
the  substance  of  this  masterful  address  spoken  on  the  spur 
of  the  moment  with  passion  and  power.  They  even  say  that 
Luke  composed  it  for  Peter  and  put  the  words  in  his  mouth. 
If  so,  he  made  a  good  job  of  it.  But  Peter  could  have  written 
out  the  notes  of  the  address  afterwards.  Luke  had  plenty  of 
chances  to  get  hold  of  it  from  Peter  or  from  others. 

37.  They  were  pricked  in  their  heart  {katenugesan  ten 
kardian).  Second  aorist  indicative  of  katanusso,  a  rare  verb 
(LXX)  to  pierce,  to  sting  sharply,  to  stun,  to  smite.  Homer 
used  it  of  horses  dinting  the  earth  with  their  hoofs.  The 
substantive  katanuxis  occurs  in  Rom.  1 1 :8.  Here  only  in  the 
N.T.  It  is  followed  here  by  the  accusative  of  the  part  af- 
fected, the  heart.  What  shall  we  do?  {Ti  poiesomen).  Delib- 
erative subjunctive  first  aorist  active.  The  sermon  went 
home,  they  felt  the  sting  of  Peter's  words,  compunction 
{compungo).    Codex  Bezae  adds:  "Show  us." 

38.  Repent  ye  (metanoesate).  First  aorist  (ingressive) 
active  imperative.  Change  your  mind  and  your  life.  Turn 
right  about  and  do  It  now.  You  crucified  this  Jesus.  Now 
crown  him  in  your  hearts  as  Lord  and  Christ.  This  first. 
And  be  baptized  every  one  of  you  {kai  baptistheto  hekastos 
humon).  Rather,  "And  let  each  one  of  you  be  baptized." 
Change  of  number  from  plural  to  singular  and  of  person  from 
second  to  third.   This  change  marks  a_break_Injt;he_thought

change  has  taken  place,  and  the  act  of  baptism  be  performed 
"in  the  name  of  Jesus  Christ"  {en  toi  onomati  lesou  Christou). 
In  accordance  with  the  command  of  Jesus  in  Matt.  28:19 
{eis  to  onoma).  No  distinction  is  to  be  insisted  on  between 
(&U  to  onoma  and  fnAoi  onomati  with  baptizo  since  eis  and  en 
are  really  the  same  word  in  origin.  In  Acts  10:48  en  tot 
onomati  lesou  Christou  occurs,  but  eis  to  onoma  in  8:16  and 
19:5.  The  use  of  onoma  means  in  the  name  or  with  the 
authority  of  one  as  eis  onoma  prophetou  (Matt.  10:41)  as  a 
prophet,  in  the  name  of  a  prophet.  In  the  Acts  the  full  name 
of  the  Trinity  does  not  occur  in  baptism  as  in  Matt.  28:19, 
but  this  does  not-shoMf^  that  it  was  not  used.  The  name  of 
Jesus  Christ  is  the  distinctive  one  in  Christian  baptism  and 
really  involves  the  Father  and  the  Spirit.  See  on  Matt.  28:19 
for  discussion  of  this  point.  "  Luke  does  not  give  the  form  of 
words  used  in  baptism  by  the  Apostles,  but  merely  states 
the  fact  that  they  baptized  those  who  acknowledged  Jesus 
as  Messiah  or  as  Lord"  (Page).  Unto  the  remission  of  your 
sins  {eis  aphesin  ton  hamartibn  humon).  This  phrase  is  the 
subject  of  endless  controversy  as  men  look  at  it  from  the 
standpoint  of  sj^ramental  or^^f_eyangelical  theology.  In 
themselves  the  words  can  express  aim  or  purpose  for  that  use 
of  eis  does  exist  as  in  I  Cor.  2:7  eis  doxan  hemon  (for  our 
glory).  But  then  another  usage  exists  which  is  just  as  good 
Greek  as  the  use  of  eis  for  aim  or  purpose.  It  is  seen  in  Matt. 
10:41  in  three  examples  eis  onoma  prophetou,  dikaiou, 
mathetou  where  it  cannot  be  purpose  or  aim,  but  rather  the 
basis  or  ground,  on  the  basis  of  the  name  of  prophet,  right- 
eous man,  disciple,  because  one  is,  etc.  It  is  seen  again  in 
Matt.  12:41  about  the  preaching  of  Jonah  {eis  to  kerugma 
lond).  They  repented  because  of  (or  at)  the  preaching  of 
Jonah.  The  illustrations  of  both  usages  are  numerous  in  the 
N.T.  and  the  Koine  generally  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  592). 
One  will  decide  the  use  here  according  as  he  believes  that 


36        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

baptism  is  essential  to  the  remission  of  sins  or  not.  My  view 

is  decidedly  against  the  idea  that  Peter,  Paul,  or  any  one  in 

the  New  Testament  taught  baptism  as  essential   to  the 

remission  of  sins  or  the  means  of  securing  such  remission. 

So  I  understand  Peter  to  be  urging  baptism  on  each  of  them 

,     who  had  already  turned  (repented)  and  for  it  to  be  done  in 

Ol    the  name  of  Jesus  Christ  on  the  basis  of  the  forgivenessjzL

(Acts  8:17)  in  the  Holy  Spirit  (genitive  of  identification). 

39.  The  promise  {he  epaggelia).  The  promise  made  by 
Jesus  (14)  and  foretold  by  Joel  (verse  18).  To  you  {humin). 
You  Jews.  To  your  descendants,  sons  and  daughters  of

from  the  Jews  were  the  heathen  (Isa.  49:1 ;  57:19;  Eph.  2:13, 
17).  The  rabbis  so  used  it.  Shall  call  {an  proskalesetai). 
First  aorist  middle  subjunctive  with  an  in  an  indefinite 
relative  clause,  a  perfectly  regular  construction.  The  Lord 
God  calls  men  of  every  nation  anywhere  whether  Jews  or 
Gentiles.  It  may  be  doubted  how  clearly  Peter  grasped  the 
significance  of  these  words  for  he  will  have  trouble  over  this 
very  matter  on  the  housetop  in  Joppa  and  in  Caesarea,  but 
he  will  see  ere  long  the  full  sweep  of  the  great  truth  that 
he  here  proclaims  under  the  impulse  of  the  Holy  Spirit. 
It  was  a  great  moment  that  Peter  here  reaches. 

40.  fFith  many  other  words  {heterois  logois  pleiosin).  In- 
strumental case.  Not  necessarily  "different"  {heterois) y 
but  "further,"  showing  that  Luke  does  not  pretend  to  give 
all  that  Peter  said.  This  idea  is  also  brought  out  clearly  by 
pleiosin  ("more,"  not  "many"),  more  than  these  given  by 
Luke.  He  testified  {diemarturato) .  First  aorist  middle  of

horted {kai  parekalei).  Imperfect  active,  kept  on  exhorting. 
Save  yourselves  (sothete).  First  aorist  passive  of  sozo.  Lit- 
erally, Be  ye  saved.  Crooked  (skolias).  Old  word,  opposite 
of  orthos,  straight.  Pravus  the  opposite  of  rectus^  a  perversity 
for  turning  off  from  the  truth.   Cf.  Luke  9:41;  Phil.  2:15. 

41.  They  then  {Hoi  men  oun).  A  common  phrase  in  Acts 
either  without  antithesis  as  in  1:6;  5:41;  8:4,  25;  9:31;  11:19; 
16:5;  or  with  it  as  here,  8:25;  13:4;  14:3;  17:17;  23:31;  25:4. 
Oun  connects  with  what  precedes  as  the  result  of  Peter's 
sermon  while  men  points  forward  to  what  is  to  follow.  Were 
baptized  {ehaptisthesan).  First  aorist  passive  indicative,  con- 
stative  aorist.  Note  that  only  those  who  had  already  received 
the  word  and  were  converted  were  baptized.  There  were 
added  (prosetethesan).  First  aorist  passive  indicative  of 
prostithemi,  old  verb  to  add,  to  join  to.  Luke  means  that 
the  3,000  were  added  to  the  120  already  enlisted.  It  is 
not  stated  they  were  all  baptized  by  Peter  or  the  twelve 
or  all  on  the  same  day,  though  that  is  the  natural  im- 
plication of  the  language.  The  numerous  pools  in  Jerusalem 
afforded  ample  opportunity  for  such  wholesale  baptizing  and 
Hackett  notes  that  the  habit  of  orientals  would  place  no  ob- 
stacle in  the  way  of  the  use  of  the  public  reservoirs.  Fur- 
neaux  warns  us  that  all  the  3,000  may  not  have  been  gen- 
uine converts  and  that  many  of  them  were  pilgrims  at  the 
passover  who  returned  home.  Souls  {psuchai).  Persons  as

Periphrastic  active  imperfect  of  proskartureo  as  in  Acts  i  :i4

word  from  koinonos  (partner,  sharer  in  common  interest) 
and  this  from  koinos  what  Is  common  to  all.  This  partnership 
involves  participation  in,  as  the  blood  of  Christ  (Phil.  2:1)  or 
co-operation  in  the  work  of  the  gospel  (Phil,  i  :5)  or  contri-

bution  for  those  in  need  (II  Cor.  8:4;  9:13).  Hence  there  is 
wide  diversity  of  opinion  concerning  the  precise  meaning  of 
koinonia  in  this  verse.  It  may  refer  to  the  distribution  of 
funds  in  verse  44  or  to  the  oneness  of  spirit  in  the  community 
of  believers  or  to  the  Lord's  Supper  (as  in  I  Cor.  10:16)  in 
the  sense  of  communion  or  to  the  fellowship  in  the  common 
meals  or  agapae  (love-feasts).  The  breaking  of  bread  {tei 
klasei  tou  artou).  The  word  klasis  is  an  old  word,  but  used 
only  by  Luke  in  the  N.T.  (Luke  24:35;  Acts  2:42),  though 
the  verb  klao  occurs  in  other  parts  of  the  N.T.  as  in  verse  46. 
The  problem  here  is  whether  Luke  refers  to  the  ordinary 
meal  as  in  Luke  24:35  or  to  the  Lord's  Supper.  The  same 
verb  klao  is  used  of  breaking  bread  at  the  ordinary  meal 
(Luke  24:30)  or  the  Lord's  Supper  (Luke  22:19).  It  is  gener- 
ally supposed  that  the  early  disciples  attached  so  much 
significance  to  the  breaking  of  bread  at  the  ordinary  meals, 
more  than  our  saying  grace,  that  they  followed  the  meal 
with  the  Lord's  Supper  at  first,  a  combination  called  agapai 
or  love- feasts.  "There  can  be  no  doubt  that  the  Eucharist 
at  this  period  was  preceded  uniformly  by  a  common  repast, 
as  was  the  case  when  the  ordinance  was  instituted"  (Hack- 
ett).  This  led  to  some  abuses  as  in  I  Cor.  11:20.  Hence  it  is 
possible  that  what  is  referred  to  here  is  the  Lord's  Supper 
following  the  ordinary  meal.  "To  simply  explain  tei  klasei 
tou  artou  as  =  'The  Holy  Communion'  is  to  pervert  the  plain 
meaning  of  words,  and  to  mar  the  picture  of  family  life, 
which  the  text  places  before  us  as  the  ideal  of  the  early 
believers"  (Page).  But  in  Acts  20:7  they  seem  to  have 
come  together  especially  for  the  observance  of  the  Lord's 
Supper.  Perhaps  there  is  no  way  to  settle  the  point  conclu- 
sively here.  The  prayers  {tats  proseuchais).  Services  where 
they  prayed  as  in  1:14,  in  the  temple  (Acts  3:1),  in  their 
homes  (4:23).

The  two  things  went  on  pari  passu,  the  more  wonders  the

(were  and).  But  they  were  together  jn  the_same  place  as  in 
2:1.  Jnd  had  {kai  eichon).  Imperfect  active,  kept  on  having,

not  actual  communism,  but  they  held  all  their  property 
read}[Jor_use  for  the  common  good  asjija^as. needed  (4:32). 

Y,  This  situation  appears  nowhere  else  except  in  Jerusalem  and 
was  evidently  due  to  special  conditions  there  which  did  not 
survive  permanently.    Later  Paul  will  take  a  special  coUec-^ 
tion  for  the  poor  saints  in  Jerusalem. 

45.  Sold  {epipraskon).  Imperfect  active,  a  habit  or  custom 
from  time  to  time.  Old  and  common  verb,  pipraskb.  Parted 
{diemerizon) .  Imperfect  again  of  diamerizo,  old  verb  for 
dividing  or  distributing  between  {dia)  people.  According  as 
any  man  had  need  {kaihoti  an  tis  chreian  eichen).  Regular 
Greek  idiom  for  comparative  clause  with  an  and  imperfect

imperfects  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  967). 

46.  With  one  accord  in  the  temple  {homothumadon  en  toi 
hieroi).  See  on  1:14  for  homothumadon.  They  were  still  wor- 
shipping in  the  temple  for  no  breach  had  vet  come  between 
Christians  and  Jews.  Daily  they  were  here  and  dally  break- 
ing bread  at  home  {kat'  oikon)  which  looks  like  the  regular 
meal.  They  did  take  their  food  {metelamhanon  trophes).  Im- 
perfect tense  again  and  clearly  referring  to  the  regular  meals 
at  home.  Does  it  refer  also  to  the  possible  agapai  or  to  the 
Lord's  Supper  afterwards  as  they  had  common  meals  "from 
house  to  house"  {kat'  oikon)  ^  We  know  there  were  local 
churches  in  the  homes  where  they  had  "worship  rooms," 
the  church  in  the  house.  At  any  rate  it  was  "with  singleness" 

I  (apheloteti)  of  heart.  The  word  occurs  only  here  in  the  N.T.,

adding.  If  the  Lord  only  always  "added"  those  who  join 
our  churches.  Note  verse  41  where  same  verb  is  used  of  the

not  leave  it  so.^  "To  the  church"  {tei  ekklesidi)  is  not  gen- 
uine. Codex  Bezae  has  "in  the  church."  Those  that  were 
being  saved  {tous  sozomenous).  Present  passive  participle. 
Probably  for  repetition  like  the  imperfect  prosetithei.  Better 
translate  it  "those  saved  from  time  to  time."  It  was  a  con- 
tinuous revival,  day  by  day.  Sbzo  like  sbteria  is  used  for 
"save"  in  three  senses  (beginning,  process,  conclusion),  but 
here  repetition  is  clearly  the  point  of  the  present  tense. 


CHAPTER  III 

1.  Were  going  up  {anebainon) .  Descriptive  imperfect 
active.  They  were  ascending  the  terraces  to  the  temple 
courts.  The  ninth  (ten  enaten).  Our  three  o'clock  in  the 
afternoon,  the  time  of  the  evening  sacrifice.  Peter  and  John 
like  Paul  later  kept  up  the  Jewish  worship,  but  not  as  a 
means  of  sacramental  redemption.  There  were  three  hours  of 
prayer  (third,  sixth,  ninth).

was  his  chance. 

4.  Fasiening  his  eyes  (atenisas).  First  aorist  (ingressive) 
active  participle  of  atenizo.  For  this  verb  see  on  Luke  4:20

him  to  look  (blepson)  on  them. 

5.  Gave  heed  unto  them  {epeichen  autois).  Imperfect  active 
of  epecho,  to  hold  to.  For  the  idiom  with  ton  noun  understood

John  with  great  eagerness  "expecting  to  receive  something" 
(prosdokon  ti  labein).  He  took  Peter's  invitation  as  a  promise 
of  a  large  gift. 

6.  In  the  name  {en  toi  onomati).  The  healing  power  is  in 
that  name  (Page)  and  Peter  says  so.  Cf.  Luke  9:49;  10:17; 
Acts  4:7,  10;  19:27;  16:18.    W-alk  {peripatei).    Present  im-

perative,  inchoative  idea,  begin  to  walk  and  then  go  on 
walking.  But  the  beggar  does  not  budge.  He  knows  that  he 
cannot  walk. 

7.  Took  him  by  the  right  hand  (piasas  auton  tes  dexias 
cheiros).  Doric  form  piazo  for  piezo.  Genitive  of  the  part 
affected.  Peter  had  to  pull  him  up  on  his  feet  before  he  would 
try  to  walk. 

8.  Leaping  up  {exallomenos).  Present  middle  participle, 
leaping  out  repeatedly  after  Peter  pulled  him  up.  Only  here 
in  the  N.T.  He  stood  (este).  Second  aorist  active.  Walked 
(periepatei).  Went  on  walking,  imperfect  active.  He  came

As  he  held  {kratountos  autou).  Genitive  absolute  of  krateOy 
to  hold  fast,  with  accusative  rather  than  genitive  to  get 
hold  of  (Acts  27:13).  Old  and  common  verb  from  kratos 
(strength,  force).  Perhaps  out  of  gratitude  and  partly  from 
fear  (Luke  8:38).  In  the  porch  that  is  called  Solomon's  (epi 
iei  stodi  tei  kaloumenei  Solomontos).  The  adjective  Stoic 
(stoikos)  is  from  this  word  stoa  (porch).  It  was  on  the  east 
side  of  the  court  of  the  Gentiles  (Josephus,  Ant.  XX.  9,  7) 
and  was  so  called  because  it  was  built  on  a  remnant  of  the 
foundations  of  the  ancient  temple.  Jesus  had  once  taught 
here  (John  10:23).  Greatly  wondering  {ekthamboi) .  Wonder-

and  so  conciliatory,  the  stock  of  Israel  (Phil.  3 :5).  At  this 
man  (epi  toutoi).  Probably  so,  though  it  could  be  "at  this 
thing."  Fasten  yon  your  eyes  {atenizeie).  The  very  verb 
used  about  Peter  in  verse  4.  On  us  (hemin).  Dative  case, 
emphatic  proleptical  position  before  ti  atenizete.  On  us  why 
do  ye  fasten  your  eyes?  As  though  {ho  s).  i^oj  with  the  partici-

{eusebeidi).  Causa  meritoria.  Had  made  {pepoiekosin). 
Perfect  active  participle  of  poieo.  To  walk  {tou  peripatein). 
Articular  infinitive  in  the  genitive  case  of  result,  purpose 
easily  shading  off  into  result  (ecbatic  infinitive)  as  here  as 
is  true  also  of  hina. 

13.  His  servant  Jesus  {ton  paida  lesoun).  This  phrase 
occurs  in  Isa.  42:1 ;  52:13  about  the  Messiah  except  the  name 
"Jesus"  which  Peter  adds,  the  first  part  of  the  quotation 
is  from  Ex.  3:6;  5:30.  The  LXX  translated  the  Hebrew 
ebhedh  by  pais,  the  servant  of  Jehovah  being  a  Messianic 
designation.  But  the  phrase  "servant  of  God"  {pais  theou) 
is  applied  also  to  Israel  (Luke  1:54)  and  to  David  (Luke 
1:69;  Acts  4:25).  Paul  terms  himself  doulos  theou  (Tit.  i:i). 
Pais  Is  just  child  (boy  or  girl),  and  it  was  also  used  of  a 
slave  (Matt,  8:6,  8,  13).  But  it  is  not  here  huios  (son)  that 
Peter  uses,  but  pais.  Luke  quotes  Peter  as  using  it  again 
in  this  Messianic  sense  in  Acts  3:26;  4:27,  30.  Whom  ye 
delivered  up  {hon  humeis  men  paredokate).  Note  emphatic 
use  of  humeis  {ye).  No  de  to  correspond  to  men.  First  aorist

pronoun,  that  one,  in  contrast  with  "ye"  {humeis)^  genitive 
absolute  with  krinantos,  here  the  nearest  word  (Pilate),  the 
latter. 

14.  But  ye  {humeis  de).  In  contrast  with  Pilate  {ekeinou). 
Murderer  {andra  phonea).    A  man  a  murderer.    In  contrast

with  "the  Holy  and  Righteous  One."  To  he  granted  {char- 
isthenai).  As  a  favour  (charis).  First  aorist  passive  infinitive 
of  charizomaif.    So  also  25:11,  27:24. 

15.  But  the  Prince  of  life  ye  killed  {ton  de  archegon  tes 
zoes  apekteinate).  "The  magnificent  antithesis"  (Bengel) 
Peter  here  draws  between  their  asking  for  a  murderer  and 
kilHng  the  Prince  (or  Author)  of  life.  Peter  pictures  Jesus  as 
the  source  of  all  life  as  is  done  in  John  1:1-18  and  Col. 
1:14-20  and  Heb.  i  :2f.  Archegos  (arcA^,  beginning,  a^o,  to 
lead)  is  an  adjective  "furnishing  the  first  cause  or  occasion" 
in  Euripides,  Plato.  Thence  substantive,  the  originator, 
the  leader,  the  pioneer  as  of  Jesus  both  Beginner  and  Fin- 
isher (Heb.  12:2).  See  also  Heb.  2:10  and  Acts  5:31  where 
it  is  applied  to  Jesus  as  "Prince  and  Saviour."  But  God 
raised  him  from  the  dead  in  contrast  to  what  they  had  done. 
Whereof  we  are  witnesses  {hou  hemeis  martures  esmen).  Of 
which  fact  (the  resurrection)  or  of  whom  as  risen,  hou  having 
the  same  form  in  the  genitive  singular  for  masculine  or 
neuter.  Peter  had  boldly  claimed  that  all  the  120  have  seen 
the  Risen  Christ.   There  is  no  denial  of  that  claim. 

16.  By  faith  in  his  name  (tei  pistei  tou  onomatos  autou). 
Instrumental  case  of  pistei  (Aleph  and  B  do  not  have  epi) 
and  objective  genitive  of  onomatos.  His  name  [to  onoma 
autou).  Repeats  the  word  name  to  make  the  point  clear. 
Cf.  verse  6  where  Peter  uses  "the  name  of  Jesus  Christ  of 
Nazareth"  when  he  healed  the  man.  Made  strong  {estereb- 
sen).  Same  verb  used  in  verse  7  (and  16:5).  Nowhere  else 
in  the  N.T.  Old  verb  from  stereos^  firm,  solid.  Through 
him  {di'  autou).  Through  Jesus,  the  object  of  faith  an;!  the 
source  of  it.  Perfect  soundness  (holoklerian).  Perfect  in  all 
its  parts,  complete,  whole  (from  holos,  whole,  kleros,  allot- 
ment). Late  word  (Plutarch)  once  in  LXX  (Isa.  1:6)  and 
here  alone  in  the  N.T.,  but  adjective  holokleros,  old  and 
common  (James  1:4;  I  Thess.  5:23). 

17.  And  now  (kai  nun).    Luke  is  fond  of  these  particles 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  45 

of  transition  (7:34;  10:5;  20:25;  22:16)  and  also  kai  ta  nun 
(4:29;  5:38;  22:32;  27:22),  and  even  kai  nun  idou  (13:11; 
20:22).  /  wot  {oida).  Old  English  for  "I  know."  In  igno- 
rance (kata  agnoian).  This  use  of  kata  occurs  in  the  KoinS. 
See  also  Philemon  14.  One  may  see  Luke  23 :34  for  the  words 
of  the  Saviour  on  the  Cross.  "They  had  sinned,  but  their 
sin  was  not  of  so  deep  a  dye  that  it  could  not  have  been  still 
more  heinous"  (Hackett).  If  they  had  known  what  they 
were  doing,  they  would  not  knowingly  have  crucified  the 
Messiah'  (I  Cor.  2:8). 

18.  Foreshewed  {prokaUggeilen).  First  aorist  active  in- 
dicative of  pTokataggellOj  late  compound  to  announce  fully 
beforehand.  Only  twice  in  the  N.T.  in  the  critical  text 
(Acts  3:18;  7:52).  That  his  Christ  should  suffer  {pathein  ton 
Christon  autou).  Accusative  of  general  reference  with  the 
aorist  active  infinitive  (pathein  of  pascho)  in  indirect  dis- 
course (predictive  purpose  of  God).  Their  crime,  though 
real,  was  carrying  out  God's  purpose  (2:23;  John  3:16). 
See  the  same  idea  in  Acts  17:3;  26:23.  This  "immense  para- 
dox" (Page)  was  a  stumbling  block  to  these  Jews  as  it  is  yet 
(I  Cor.  1:23).  Peter  discusses  the  sufferings  of  Christ  in 
I  Peter  4:13;  5:1. 

19.  Repent  therefore  {metanoesate  oun).  Peter  repeats  to 
this  new  crowd  the  command  made  in  Acts  2:38  which  see. 
God's  purpose  and  patience  call  for  instant  change  of  atti- 
tude on  their  part.  Their  guilt  does  not  shut  them  out  if 
they  will  turn.  And  turn  again  {kai  epistrepsate) .  Definitely 
turn  to  God  in  conduct  as  well  as  in  mind.  That  your  sins 
may  be  blotted  out  {pros  to  exaliphthenai  humon  tas  hamartias). 
Articular  infinitive  (first  aorist  passive  of  exaleipho,  to  wipe 
out,  rub  off,  erase,  smear  out,  old  verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only 
here  and  Col.  2:14)  with  the  accusative  of  general  reference 
and  with  pros  and  the  accusative  to  express  purpose.  That  so 
{hopos  an).  Final  particle  with  an  and  the  aorist  active 
subjunctive  elthosin  (come)  and  not  "when"  as  the  Author- 


46        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

ized  Version  has  it.  Some  editors  put  this  clause  in  verse 
20  (Wescott  and  Hort,  for- instance).  Seasons  of  refreshing 
{kairoi  anapsuxebs).  The  word  anapsuxis  (from  anapsucho, 
to  cool  again  or  refresh,  II  Tim.  i:i6)  is  a  late  word  (LXX) 
and  occurs  here  alone  in  the  N.T.  Surely  repentance  will 
bring  "seasons  of  refreshing  from  the  presence  of  the  Lord." 

20.  And  that  he  may  send  the  Christ  zvho  hath  been  ap- 
pointed for  you,  even  Jesus  {kai  aposteilei  ton  prokecheiris- 
menon  humin  Christon  lesoun).  First  aorist  active  sub- 
junctive with  hopos  an  as  in  15:17  and  Luke  2:35.  There  is 
little  real  difference  in  idea  between  hopds  an  and  hina  an. 
There  is  a  conditional  element  in  all  purpose  clauses.  The 
reference  is  naturally  to  the  second  coming  of  Christ  as 
verse  21  shows.  Knowling  admits  "that  there  is  a  spiritual 
presence  of  the  enthroned  Jesus  which  believers  enjoy  as  a 
foretaste  of  the  visible  and  glorious  Presence  of  the  Par- 
ousia.^^  Jesus  did  promise  to  be  with  the  disciples  all  the 
days  (Matt.  28:20),  and  certainly  repentance  with  accom- 
panying seasons  of  refreshing  help  get  the  world  ready  for  the 
coming  of  the  King.  The  word  prokecheirismenon  (perfect 
passive  participle  of  procheirizo,  from  procheiros^  at  hand, 
to  take  into  one's  hands,  to  choose)  is  the  correct  text  here, 
not  prokekerugmenon.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  22: 
14;  26:16.  It  is  not  "Jesus  Christ"  here  nor  "Christ  Jesus," 
but  "the  Messiah,  Jesus,"  identifying  Jesus  with  the  Mes- 
siah. See  the  Second  Epiphany  of  Jesus  foretold  also  in 
I  Tim.  6:15  and  the  First  Epiphany  described  in  I  Pet.  i  :20. 

21.  Restoration  (apokatastaseos).  Double  compound  (apo, 
kata,  histemi),  here  only  in  the  N.T.,  though  common  in 
late  writers.  In  papyri  and  inscriptions  for  repairs  to  temples 
and  this  phrase  occurs  in  Jewish  apocalyptic  writings,  some- 
thing like  the  new  heaven  and  the  new  earth  of  Rev.  21:1. 
Paul  has  a  mystical  allusion  also  to  the  agony  of  nature  in 
Rom.  8:20-22.  The  verb  apokathistemi  is  used  by  Jesus  of 
the  spiritual  and  moral  restoration  wrought  by  the  Baptist 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  47 

as  Elijah  (Matt.  17:11  =Mark  9:12)  and  by  the  disciples 
to  Jesus  in  Acts  1:6.  Josephus  uses  the  word  of  the  return 
from  captivity  and  Philo  of  the  restitution  of  inheritances 
in  the  year  of  jubilee.  As  a  technical  medical  term  it  means 
complete  restoration  to  health.  See  a  like  idea  in  palin- 
genesi'a  (renewal,  new  birth)  in  Matt.  19:28  and  Tit.  3:5. 
This  universalism  of  Peter  will  be  clearer  to  him  after  Joppa 
and  Caesarea. 

22.  Like  unto  me  (hos  erne).  As  me,  literally;  Moses  (Deut. 
18:14-18)  claims  that  God  raised  him  up  as  a  prophet  and 
that  another  and  greater  one  will  come,  the  Messiah.  The 
Jews  understood  Moses  to  be  a  type  of  Christ  (John  1:21). 
God  spoke  to  Moses  face  to  face  (Ex.  33:11)  and  he  was  the 
greatest  of  the  prophets  (Deut.  34:10). 

23.  That  prophet  {tou  prophetou  ekeinou).  Emphasizes 
the  future  prophet  as  on  "him"  (autou)  before  "hearken." 
They  had  refused  to  "hearken"  to  Moses  and  now,  alas, 
many  had  refused  to  "hearken"  to  Christ.  Shall  be  utterly 
destroyed  (exolethreuthesetai).  First  future  passive  of  exole- 
(0)  threuo,  a  late  verb,  to  destroy  utterly  {ex)^  only  here  in 
the  N.T.,  common  in  the  LXX. 

24.  From  Samuel  {apo  Samouel).  Schools  of  prophets 
arose  in  his  time,  few  before  him  (I  Sam.  3:1). 

25.  Ye  (Humeis).  Emphatic  position.  The  covenant  which 
God  made  (tes  diathekes  hes  ho  theos  dietheto).  Literally, 
"the  covenant  which  God  covenanted."  Diatheke  and  di- 
etheto (second  aorlst  middle  indicative  of  diathemi)  are  the 
same  root.  See  on  Matt.  26:28.  The  covenant  (agreement 
between  two,  dia,  tithemi)  was  with  Abraham  (Gen.  12:1-3) 
and  repeated  at  various  times  (Gen.  18:18;  22:18;  26:4, 
etc.).  In  Heb.  9:15-18  the  word  is  used  both  for  covenant 
and  will.  The  genitive  relative  hes  attracted  to  case  of  the 
antecedent. 

26.  Unto  you  first  (Humin  proton).  The  Jews  were  first 
in  privilege  and  it  was  through  the  Jews  that  the  Messiah 


48        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

was  to  come  for  "all  the  families  of  the  earth."  His  servant 
{ton  paida  autou).  As  in  verse  13,  the  Messiah  as  God's 
Servant.  To  bless  you  {eulogounta  humas).  Present  active 
participle  to  express  purpose,  blessing  you  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  p.  991).  In  turning  away  {en  toi  apostrephein). 
Articular  infinitive  in  the  locative  case,  almost  preserved  in 
the  English. 


CHAPTER  IV 

1.  The  captain  of  the  temple  {ho  strategos  tou  hierou). 
Twenty-four  bands  of  Levites  guarded  the  temple,  one  guard 
at  a  time.  They  watched  the  gates.  The  commander  of 
each  band  was  called  captain  (strategos).  Josephus  names 
this  captain  of  the  temple  police  next  to  the  high  priest  {War. 
VI.  5,  3).  The  Sadducees  {hoi  Saddoukaioi) .  Most  of  the 
priests  were  Sadducees  now  and  alLjthe_chief_priests  since 
John  Hyrcanus  I  deserted  the  Pharisees  (Josephus,  ^nt. 
XVII.  10,  6;  XVIII.  I,  4;  XX.  9,  i).  The  Sadducees  were 
slow  to  line  up  with  the  Pharisees  against  Jesus,  but  they  now 
take  the  lead  against  Peter  and  John.  Came  upon  them  {ep- 
estesan  autois).  Second  aorist  active  indicative  (intransi- 
tive). Burst  upon  them  suddenly  or  stood  by  them  in  a 
hostile  attitude  here  (Luke  20:1;  2414.;  Acts  6:12;  17:5;  22:20; 
23:11). 

2.  Being  sore  troubled  {diaponoumenoi) .  Present  passive 
participle  of  old  verb  diaponeo  (perfective  use  of  did)  to  be 
worked  up,  indignant.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  16:8. 
Because  {dia  to).  The  articular  infinitive  with  two  accusa- 
tives, one  the  object  (the  people),  the  other  ("they")  of 
general  reference.  In  Jesus  {en  lesou).  In  the  case  of  Jesus, 
an  actual  instance  of  resurrection  which  the  Sadducees 
denied  (Matt.  22:23).  This  same  use  of  en  appears  in  I 
Cor.  4:6  (in  us).  The  Sadducees  were  also  aristocrats  and 
political  ecclesiastics  who  disliked  popular  disturbances.  In 
particular,  they  resented  the  claim  about  Jesus  whom  they 
had  helped  crucify. 

3.  In  ward  {eis  teresin).  Probably  in  one  of  the  chambers 
of  the  temple.  In  safe  keeping  (from  tereo,  to  guard).  Old 
word,  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  5:18;  I  Cor.  7:19.    So 

49 


so        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

in  papyri.  Now  eventide  {hespera  ede).  Hence  no  trial  could 
take  place  before  the  next  day,  a  regulation  violated  in  the 
case  of  Jesus. 

4.  Men  (andron).  Strictly,  men  and  not  women,  for 
anthropos  is  the  term  for  both  men  and  women.  But  in 
Luke  11:31  andres  seems  to  include  both  men  and  women 
and  that  is  possible  here,  though  by  no  means  certain,  for 
see  Matt.  14:21  where  the  women  and  children  are  expressly 
excepted. 

5.  Rulers  and  elders  and  scribes  (tons  archontas  kai  tous 
presbuterous  kai  tous  grammateis) .  The  three  classes  com- 
posing the  Sanhedrin  (rulers  =  chief  priests  who  were  Sad- 
ducees,  the  scribes  usually  Pharisees,  the  elders  not  in  either 
class:  24  priests,  24  elders,  22  scribes).  fFere  gathered  to- 
gether  {sunachthenai).  First  aorist  passive  infinitive  of 
sunago  with  accusative  of  general  reference  and  the  subject 
of  egeneto. 

6.  Annas  {H annas).  One  of  the  rulers  or  chief  priests,  ex- 
high  priest  (a.d.  7-14)  and  father-in-law  of  Caiaphas  {Kaia- 
phas)  who  was  actual  high  priest  at  that  time,  though  the 
title  clung  to  Annas  as  here  (both  so  called  in  Luke  3:2), 
Caiaphas_so_by  Rojnan  law,  Annas  so  in  the  opinion  of  the 

Jews.  They  with  John  and  Alexander  are  the  leaders  among 
the~Sadducees  in  pressing  the  case  against  Peter  and  John. 

7.  In  the  midst  {en  toi  mesoi).  The  Sanhedrin  sat  in  a 
semicircle.  They  inquired  (epunthanonto) .  Imperfect  mid- 
dle, began  to  inquire.  Or  in  what  name  (e  en  poioi  onomati). 
As  if  by  some  magical  formula  such  as  exorcists  practised 
(Acts  19:13)  as  if  to  catch  them  by  (Deut.  13:1).  Have  ye 
done  this  {epoiesate  touto  humeis).  Note  emphatic  use  of 
humeis  (ye). 

8.  Filled  with  the  Holy  Spirit  {plestheis  pneumatos  hagiou). 
.For  this  occasion  and  so  above  all  fear  as  in  verse  3 1  and  as 

in  2:4. 

9.  Concerning  a  good  deed  done  to  an  impotent  man  {epi 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  5 1 

euergesidi  anthropou  asthenous).  Objective  genitive.  Note 
euergesia  (old  word,  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  I  Tim.  6:2), 
as  a  benefactor,  not  a  malefactor.  Skilful  turn  made  by- 
Peter.  Is  made  whole  (sesostai).  Perfect  passive  indicative 
of  sozo,  siajjds  whole. 

10.  Be  it  known  {gnoston  esto).  Imperative  present  active 
third  singular  of  eimi,  to  be,  and  the  verbal  adjective  gnoston. 
Whom  ye  crucified  (hon  humeis  estaurbsate).  Too  good  a 
chance  to  miss,  and  so  Peter  boldly  charges  the  Sajihedrin 
with  responsibility  for  the  death  of  Jesus.  Note  humeis  (ye) 
again.  Whom  God  raised  from  the  dead  {hon  ho  theos  egeiren  ek 
nekron).  Note  repetition  of  hon  {whom).  This  is  God's 
answer  to  their  act  of  crucifixion.  In  him  doth  this  man  stand 
{en  toutoi  houtos  paresteken).  Rather  (note  play  on  houtos), 
"In  this  one  {hon,  hon)  this  one  stands  (present  perfect  ac- 
tive indicative,  intransitive)."  In  Jesus  this  man  stands 
before  you  whole  {hugies).  It  was  a  centre  shot. 

11.  Of  you  the  builders  {huph*  humon  ton  oikodomon).  The 
experts,  the  architects,  had  rejected  Jesus  for  their  building 
(Psa.  118:22)  as  Jesus  himself  had  pointed  out  (Matt. 
21 142  =  Luke  21:17).  This  very  Rejected  Stone  God  had 
made  the  .head  of  the  corner  (either  the  highest  corner  stone 
right  under  the  roof  or  the  comer  stone  under  the  building, 
Isa.  28:16)  as  Jesus  showed,  as  Peter  here  declares  and  re- 
peats later  (I  Peter  2:6f.). 

12.  Salvation  {he  soteria).  The  Messianic  salvation  as  in 
5:31;  17:11  and  as  Jesus  meant  in  John  4:22.  It  is  amazing  to 
see  Peter  speaking  thus  to  the  Sanhedrin  and  proclaiming  the 
necessity  of  salvation  {dei  sbthenai)  in  the  name  of  Jesus 
Christ  and  in  no  other.  If  this  was  true  then,  it  is  true  today. 
There  is  no  second  (heteron)  name  to  go  beside  that  of  Jesus 
in  India,  China,  Japan,  or  America. 

13.  The  boldness  {ten  parresian).  Telling  it  all  {pan,  resia). 
See  also  verses  29,  31.  Actually  Peter  had  turned  the  table 
on  the  Sanhedrin  and  had  arraigned  them  before  the  bar 


52        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

of  God.  Had  perceived  {katalabomenoi).  Second  aorist  middle 
participle  of  katalambano,  common  verb  to  grasp  strongly 
{kata)j  literally  or  with  the  mind  (especially  middle  voice), 
to  comprehend.  The  rulers  recalled  Peter  and  John  from 
having  seen  them  often  with  Jesus,  probably  during  the 
temple  teaching,  etc.  They  were  unlearned  [agrammaioi 
eisin).  Present  indicative  retained  in  indirect  discourse. 
Unlettered  men  without  technical  training  in  the  professional 
rabbinical  schools  of  Hillel  or  Shammai.  Jesus  himself  was 
so  regarded  (John  7:15,  "not  having  learned  letters").  Jnd 
ignorant  {kai  idibtai).  Old  word,  only  here  in  the  N.T.  and 
I  Cor.  14:24;  II  Cor.  11:6.  It  does  not  mean  "ignorant," 
but  a  layman,  a  man  not  in  office  (a  private  person),  a 
common  soldier  and  not  an  officer,  a  man  not  skilled  in  the 
schools,  very  much  like  agrammatos.  It  is  from  idios  (one*s 
own)  and  our  "idiosyncracy"  is  one  with  an  excess  of  such 
a  trait,  while  "idiot"  (this  very  word)  is  one  who  has  nothing 
but  his  idiosyncracy.  Peter  and  John  were  men  of  ability 
and  of  courage,  but  they  did  not  belong  to  the  set  of  the 
rabbis.  They  marvelled  (ethaumazon) .  Imperfect  (inchoative) 
active,  began  to  wonder  and  kept  it  up.  Took  knowledge  of 
them  {epeginoskon  autous).  Imperfect  (inchoative)  active 
again,  they  began  to  recognize  them  as  men  that  they  had 
seen  with  Jesus. 

14.  They  could  say  nothing  against  it  {ouden  eichon  antei- 
pein).  Imperfect  again,  they  keg^t  on  having  nothing  to  say 
against  it.  The  lame  man  was  standing  there  before  their 
eyes  in  proof  of  what  Peter  had  said. 

15.  They  conferred  among  themselves  (suneballon  pros 
allelous).  Imperfect  active  again.  With  Peter  and  John  and 
the  lame  man  outside,  they  began  to  compare  (jwn,  hallo) 
notes  and  take  stock  of  their  predicament. 

16.  What  shall  we  do?  {Ti  poiesomen).  Deliberative  aorist 
active  subjunctive  (ingressive  and  urgent  aorist).  Notable 
miracle  {gnoston  semeion).   Or  sign.    It  was  useless  to  deny  it 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  53 

with  the  man  there.      We  cannot  deny  it   {ou  dunametha 
arneisthai).   That  is,  it  will  do  no  good.  J 

17.  That  it  spread  no  further  (hina  me  epi  pleion  dianeme- 
thei).  First  aorist  passive  subjunctive  of  dianemo,  to  dis- 
tribute with  hina  me,  negative  purpose.  Let  us  threaten  them 
{apeilesometha  autois).  Hortatory  aorist  middle  subjunctive 
of  apeileo,  old  verb  (note  middle  voice).  In  the  N.T.  only 
here  and  I  Peter  2:23.  That  they  speak  henceforth  to  no  man 
in  this  name  (meketi  lalein  epi  toi  onomati  toutoi  medeni  anthro- 
pon).  Indirect  command  with  the  infinitive  and  double  nega- 
tive {meketi,  medeni).  They  will  not  say  "Jesus,"  but  make 
a  slur  at  "ihis  name."  contemptuous  use  of  houtos,  though 
they  apparently  do  mention  the  name  "Jesus"  in  verse  18. 

18.  Not  to  speak  at  all  {katholou  me  phtheggesthai).  Same 
construction  as  above,  infinitive  in  indirect  command  with 
negative  me  (and  mede). 

20.  For  we  cannot  but  speak  (ou  dunametha  gar  hemeis — me 
lalein).  Both  negatives  hold  here,  "For  we  (note  emphatic 
hemeis)  are  not  able  not  to  speak"  (what  we  saw  and  heard). 

I  This  is  defiance  of  the  civil  and  ecclesiastical  authorities  that 
was  justified,  for  the  temple  authorities  stepped  in  between 
the  conscience  and  God.  Peter  and  John  were  willing  to  pay 
the  price  of  this  defiance  with  their  lives.  This  is  the  courage 
of  martyrs  through  all  the  ages. 

21.  When  they  had  further  threatened  them  (prosapeilesa- 
menoi).  The  "further"  is  in  ''pros"  (in  addition).  Finding 
nothing  how  they  might  punish  them  (meden  heuriskontes  to 
pds  kolas ontai  autous).  Note  the  article  "io"  before  pos 
{how),  "the  how."  Aorist  middle  deliberative  subjunctive 
kolasontai  in  indirect  question  after  pos  from  kolazo,  to  lop 
(kolos,  lopped),  to  curb,  to  prune,  to  correct,  to_punish.  Old 
verb,  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  II  Pet.  2:9.  Glorified  God 
{edoxazon  ton  theon).  Imperfect  active,  ^ke£t_on  glorifying 
God  while  the  Sanhedrin  were  threatening  Peter  and  John. 

[It  was  to  laugh  at  the  helplessness  of  the  Sanhedrin.

22.  Was  wrought  (gegonei).  Second  past  perfect  active 
without  augment  from  ginomai. 

23.  To  their  own  company  {pros  tous  idious).  Their  own 
people  as  in  John  i:ii;  13:1;  Acts  24:23;  I  Tim.  5:8;  Tit. 
3:14,  not  merely  the  apostles  (all  the  disciples).  In  spite  of 
Peter's  courageous  defiance  he  and  John  told  the  brother- 
hood all  that  had  been  said  by  the  Sanhedrin.  They  had  real 
apprehension  of  the  outcome. 

24.  With  one  accord  (homothumadon) .  A  concert  of  voices 
as  already  seen  by  the  word  in  1:14;  2:46  and  later  in  5:12; 
7:57;  15:25.  0  Lord  (Despota).  Our  word  despot.  Old  word 
for  relation  of  master  to  slaves  or  household  servants  (I  Tim. 
6:1;  II  Tim.  2:21;  Tit.  2:9;  I  Peter  2:18).  Simeon  thus 
addressed  God  (Luke  2:29).  So  in  II  Peter  2:1;  Jude  4; 
6:10.  See  " slaves "  in  verse  29. 

25.  By  the  mouth  of  our  father  David  (tou  patros  hemon 
dia  pneumatos  hagiou  stomatos  Daueid).  From  Psa,  2: if. 
here  ascribed  to  David.  Baumgarten  suggests  that  the 
whQle__cornpany__saiig-  the  second  Psalm  and  then  Peter 
applied  it  to  this  emergency.  The  Greek  MSS.  do  not  have 
dia  (by)  here  before  stomatos,  but  only  dia  before  pneumatos 
hagiou  (the  Holy  Spirit).  Hort  calls  this  a  "primitive  error" 
perhaps  due  to  an  early  scribe  who  omitted  this  second  dia 
so  close  to  the  first  dia  (Robertson,  Introduction  to  the  Tex- 
tual Criticism  of  the  N.T.,  p.  238).  A  small  list  of  such 
primitive  errors  is  there  given  as  suggested  by  Dr.  Hort. 
Why  {hina  ti).  This  Greek  idiom  calls  for  genetai  (sec- 
ond aorist  middle  subjunctive),  That  what  may  happen. 
The  Gentiles  (ethne).  So  always  in  LXX,  while  laoi  (peo-

horse,  to  prance  or  stamp  the  ground,  to  put  on  lofty  airs. 
Only  here  in  the  N.T.  in  this  quotation  from  Psa.  2:1.

tion,  as  orators  and  rhetoricians.    Only  here  in  the  N.T.  in 
this  quotation. 

26.  Set  themselves  in  array  (parestesan).  Literally,  stood 
by.  Against  his  Anointed  {kata  tou  Christou  autou).  Against 
his  Messiah,  his  Christ. 

27.  Both  Herod  and  Pontics  Pilate  {Her aides  te  kai  Pontius 
Peilatos).  Luke  alone  (Luke  23:12)  tells  of  the  reconcilia- 
tion between  Herod  and  Pilate  at  the  trial  of  Jesus.  So  Peter 
and  the  rest  interpret  this  prophecy  as  directly  fulfilled  in 
their  conduct  towards  Jesus  Christ.  Whom  thou  didst  anoint 
(hon  echrisas).  As  in  verse  26  (cf.  Luke  4:18  and  Isa.  61  :i). 
Inaugurated  as  King  Messiah. 

28.  Foreordained  (proorisen).  First  aorist  active  indica- 
tive of  proorizOj  "They  rise  above  sight  and  seem  to  see  the 
Hand  which  *  shapes  men's  ends,  rough  hew  them  how  they 
will'  "  (Fumeaux). 

29.  And  now  (kai  ta  nun).  "And  as  to  (accusative  of 
general  reference)  the  now  things  (the  present  situation)." 
Only  in  the  Acts  in  the  N.T.  (5:38;  17:30;  20:32;  27:22). 
Grant  (d&j^  Second  aorisX,active  imperative  of  didomi, 
urgency  of  the  aorist.  Do  it  now.  To  speak  thy  word  with  all 
boldness  (meta  parresias  pases  lalein  ton  logon  sou).  Lit- 
erally, "with  all  boldness  to  go  on  speaking  (present  active 
infinitive)  thy  word."  Peter  and  John  had  defied  the  San- 
hedrin  in  verse  20,  but  all  the  same  and  all  the  more  they 
pray  for  courage  in  deed  to  live  up  to  their  brave  words. 
A  wholesome  lesson. 

30.  While  thou  stretchest  forth  thy  hand  [en  toi  ten  cheira 
ekteinein  se).  Luke's  favourite  idiom,  "In  the  stretching  out 
(articular  present  active  infinitive)  the  hand  as  to  thee" 
(accusative  of  general  reference),  the  second  allusion  to 
God's  "hand"  in  this  prayer  (verse  28).  To  heal  (eis  iasin). 
For  healing.  See  verse  22.  And  that  signs  and  wonders  may 
be  done  {kai  semeia  kai  terata  ginesthai).  Either  to  be  taken 
as  in  the  same  construction  as  ekteinein  with  en  toi  as  Re-

vised  Version  has  it  here  or  to  be  treated  as  subordinate 
purpose  to  en  toi  ekteinein  (as  Knowling,  Page,  Wendt, 
Hackett).  The  latter  most  likely  true.  They  ask  for  a  visi- 
ble sign  or  proof  that  God  has  heard  this  prayer  for  courage 
to  be  faithful  even  unto  death. 

31.  The  place  was  shaken  {esaleuthe  ho  topos).  By  an  earth- 
quake most  likely  as  in  16:26,  but  none  the  less  a  token  of 
God's  presence  and  power  (Psa.  114:7;  Isa.  2:19,  21;  Heb. 
I2:26f.).  Were  gathered  together  {esan  sunegmenoi).  Peri- 
phrastic past  perfect  passive  of  sunago.  They  spake  (elaloun). 
Imperfect  active  indicative,  began  to  speak,  after  being 
filled  {eplesthesan,  aorist  passive  indicative)  with  the  Holy 
Spirit.  Luke  uses  the  very  words  of  the  prayer  in  verse  29 
to  describe  their  conduct. 

32.  Of  one  heart  and  soul  {kardia  kai  psuche  mia).  It  is 
not  possible  to  make  sharp  distinction  between  heart  and 
soul  here  (see  Mark  12:30),  only  that  there  was  harmony 
in  thought  and  affection.  But  the  English  translation  is 
curiously  unlike  the  Greek  original.  "There  was  one  heart 
and  soul  (nominative  case,  not  genitive  as  the  English  has 
it)  in  the  multitude  {tou  plethous,  subjective  genitive)  of 
those  who  believed."  Not  one  of  them  (oude  heis).  More 
emphatic  than  oudeis,  "not  even  one."  Common  {koina). 
In  the  use  of  their  property,  not  in  the  possession  as  Luke 
proceeds  to  explain.  The  word  koinos  is  kin  to  sun  (together 
with)=A;wn  (Epic)  and  so  xunos  =  koinos.  See  this  word  al- 
ready in  2:44.  The  idea  of  unclean  (Acts  10:15)  ^^  a  later 
development  from  the  original  notion  of  common  to  all. 

33.  Gave  their  witness  {apedidoun  to  marturion).  Imper- 
fect active  of  apodidomi,  old  verb  to  give  back,  to  pay  back  a 
debt  (Luke  7:42),  but  a  late  omega  form  instead  of  the  usual 
apedidosan.  They  kept  on  giving  their  witness  with  power 
after  the  answer  to  their  prayer  (verse  31).  Of  the  resurrec- 
tion {tes  anastaseos).  It  was  on  this  issue  that  the  Sadducees 
had  arrested  them   (4:1-3). 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  $7 

34.  That  lacked  {endees).  Literally,  in  need,  old  adjective, 
here  only  in  the  N.T.  Were  (huperchon).  Imperfect  active 
of  huparcho,  to  exist.  Sold  them  and  brought  {polountes 
epheron).  Present  active  participle  and  imperfect  active 
indicative.  Selling  they  brought  from  time  to  time,  as  there 
was  occasion  by  reason  of  need.  Hence  the  wants  were  kept 
supplied.  Laid  them  (etithoun).  Imperfect  active  again, 
repetition,  of  tithemi,  late  omega  form  for  the  usual  etithesan. 

35.  Distribution  was  made  (diedideto).  Imperfect  passive 
of  diadidomi,  late  omega  form  for  diedidoto  (the  stem  vowel 
0  displaced  by  e).  Impersonal  use  of  the  verb  here.  Accord- 
ing as  any  one  had  need  {kathoti  an  tis  chreian  eichen).  Im- 
perfect active  of  echo  with  kathoti  and  an  with  the  notion  of 
customary  repetition  in  a  comparative  clause  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  p.  967). 

36.  Barnabas  {Barnabas).  His  name  was  Joseph  (correct 
text,  and  not  Jesus)  and  he  is  mentioned  as  one  illustration 
of  those  in  verse  34  who  selling  brought  the  money.  The 
apostles  gave  him  the  nickname  Barnabas  by  which  later  he 
was  known  because  of  this  noble  deed.  This  fact  argues  that 
all  did  not  actually  sell,  but  were  ready  to  do  so  if  needed. 
Possibly  Joseph  had  a  larger  estate  than  some  others  also. 
The  meaning  of  the  nickname  is  given  by  Luke  as  "son  of 
consolation  or  exhortation"  (huios  parakleseos).  Doubtless 
his  gifts  as  a  preacher  lay  along  this  same  line.  Rackham 
thinks  that  the  apostles  gave  him  this  name  when  he  was 
recognized  as  a  prophet.  In  Acts  1 1 123  the  very  word  pare- 
kalei  (exhorted)  is  used  of  Barnabas  up  at  Antioch.  He  is  the 
type  of  preacher  described  by  Paul  in  I  Cor.  14:3.  Encour- 
agement is  the  chief  idea  in  paraklesis  though  exhortation, 
comfort,  consolation  are  used  to  render  it  (Acts  9:31;  13:15; 
15:31).  See  also  16:9;  20:12.  It  is  not  necessary  to  think 
that  the  apostles  coined  the  name  Barnabas  for  Joseph 
which  originally  may  have  come  from  Barnebous  (Deiss- 
mann,  Bible  Studies,  pp.  308-10),  son  of  Nebo,  or  even  the 


S8        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Hebrew  Bar  Nebi  (son  of  a  prophet).  But,  whatever  the 
origin,  the  popular  use  is  given  by  Luke.  He  was  even  called 
apostle  along  with  Paul  (Acts  14:14)  in  the  broad  sense  of 
that  word. 

37.  Having  a  field  {huparchontos  autoi  agrou).  Genitive 
absolute  with  present  active  participle  of  huparchb  and 
dative  of  possession.  Sold  it  and  brought  {polesas  erugken). 
Aorist  active  pirticiple  of  poled  and  second  aorist  active 
indicative  of  pherb  because  a  single  definite  instance.  So  also 
with  etheken  (laid),  first  aorist  active. 


CHAPTER  V 

1.  Sold  {epblesen).  Aorist  active  indicative  again,  for  a 
single  case. 

2.  Kept  back  {enosphisato).  First  aorist  middle  indica- 
tive of  nosphizo,  old  verb  from  nosphi,  afar,  apart,  and  so  to 
set  apart,  to  separate  for  oneself,  but  only  here,  verse  3 
and  Tit.  2:10  in  the  N.T.  His  wife  also  being  privy  to  it 
{suneiduies  kai  tes  gunaikos).  Genitive  absolute  with  second 
perfect  participle  of  sunoida,  to  know  together  with  one, 
"his  wife  also  knowing  it  together  with  him."  Brought  a 
certain  part  {enegkas  meros  ti).  Aorist  active  participle  of 
phero,  for  a  definite  act.  The  praise  of  Joseph  was  too  much 
for  Ananias,  but  he  was  not  willing  to  turn  over  all.  He 
wanted  praise  for  giving  all  and  yet  he  took  care  of  himself 
by  keeping  some.  Thus  he  started  the  Ananias  Club  that 
gave  a  new  meaning  to  his  lovely  name  (God  is  gracious). 

3.  Filled  (eplerosen).  The  very  verb  used  of  the  filling 
by  the  Holy  Spirit  (4:31).  Satan  the  adversary  is  the  father 
of  lies  (John  8:44).  He  had  entered  into  Judas  (Luke  22:3; 
John  13 :27)  and  now  he  has  filled  the  heart  of  Ananias  with  a 
lie.  To  lie  to  the  Holy  Spirit  (pseusasthai  se  to  pneuma  to 
hagion).  Infinitive  (aorist  middle)  of  purpose  with  accusa- 
tive of  general  reference  {se)  and  the  accusative  of  the  person 
(object)  as  often  in  Greek  writers,  though  here  only  in  the 
N.T.  with  this  verb.  Usual  dative  of  the  person  in  verse  4 
{anthropois^  men,  toi  theoi,  God).  The  Holy  Spirit  had  been 
given  them  to  guide  them  into  truth  (John  15:13). 

4.  Whiles  it  remained  (menon).  Present  active  participle 
of  mendf  unsold,  Peter  means,  ^fter  it  was  sold  (prathen). 
First  aorist  passive  of  piprasko,  to  sell.  How  is  that  thou 
hast  conceived  (Ti  hoti  ethou).   Quid  est  quod.   See  Luke  2:49. 

59 


6o        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

See  also  Acts  5:9.  Second  aorist  middle  indicative  second 
person  singular  of  tithemi.  The  devil  filled  his  heart  (verse 
3),  but  all  the  same  Ananias  did  it  too  and  is  wholly  respon- 
sible. 

5.  Hearing  (akouon).  Present  active  participle  of  akouoy 
while  hearing.  Fell  down  {pes on).  Second  aorist  active  parti- 
ciple of  pipto,  fell  all  of  a  sudden  while  listening.  Gave  up 
the  ghost  {exepsuxen).  First  aorist  active  indicative  of  ek- 
psucho,  late  verb  in  LXX  and  Hippocrates,  to  breathe  out, 
to  expire.  In  the  N.T.  only  here,  verse  10,  and  12:23.  It  is 
needless  to  blame  Peter  for  the  death  of  Ananias.  He  had 
brought  the  end  upon  himself.  It  was  the  judgment  of  God. 
Physically  the  nervous  shock  could  have  caused  the  collapse. 

6.  The  young  men  (hoi  neoteroi).  Literally  the  younger 
men  (contrast  with  hoi  presbuteroi,  the  elder  men).  Same  as 
neaniskoi  in  verse  10  and  so  no  order  in  the  young  church. 
Perhaps  these  young  men  were  acting  as  ushers  or  actual 
pallbearers.  Wrapped  him  round  {sunesteilan).  First  aorist 
active  indicative  of  sustello,  old  verb,  to  draw  together,  or 
contract  (I  Cor.  7:29),  to  roll  together,  to  wrap  with  band- 
ages, to  enshroud  as  here.  Nowhere  else  in  the  N.T.  Fre- 
quent in  medical  writers.  They  may  have  used  their  own 
mantles.  The  time  for  burial  was  short  in  Jerusalem  for 
sanitary  reasons  and  to  avoid  ceremonial  defilement. 

7.  And  it  was  about  the  space  of  three  hours  after  {egeneto 
de  hos  horon  trion  diastema).  Literally  "Now  there  came  an 
interval  {diastema^  distance,  space  between)  of  about  {hos) 
three  hours."  When  {kai).  This  use  of  kai  after  egeneto  is 
characteristic  of  Luke's  style  in  the  Gospel.  Not  knowing 
{me  eiduia).  Feminine  singular  of  second  perfect  active  par- 
ticiple of  oida.  Me  usual  negative  of  the  participle  in  the 
Koine. 

8.  For  so  much  (tosoutou).  Genitive  of  price.  Perhaps 
Peter  pointed  to  the  pile  of  money  at  the  feet  of  the  apostles 
(verse  2).    The  use  of  ei  in  direct  questions  appears  in  Luke 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  6l 

(13:23;  22:49)  ^s  in  the  LXX  like  the  Hebrew  im  and  in 
Acts  1:6;  19:2,  etc. 

9.  Ye  have  agreed  together  {sunephbnethe  humin).  First 
aorist  passive  indicative  of  sumphoneo  (to  voice  together, 
symphony),  impersonal  with  dative;  It  was  agreed  together 
by  you  (or  for  you).  "Your  souls  were  allured  together 
respecting  this  deceit"  (Vincent).  To  tempt  the  Spirit  of  the 
Lord  {peirasai  to  pneuma  kuriou).  Like  "Thou  shalt  not 
tempt  the  Lord  thy  God."  It  was  close  to  the  unpardonable 
sin  which  was  attributing  the  manifest  work  of  the  Holy 
Spirit  to  Beelzebub.  The  feet  {hoi  podes).  Graphic  picture 
by  Peter  as  he  heard  the  steps  of  the  young  men  at  the  door. 

10.  Immediately  {parachrema).  Hence  her  death  was  re- 
garded as  supernatural  like  that  of  Ananias.  By  her  husband 
{pros  ton  andra  antes).   Face  to  face  to  her  husband. 

11.  Upon  the  whole  church  {eph^  hoi  en  ten  ekklesian).  Here 
ekklesia  for  the  first  time  in  Acts  of  the  believers  in  Jeru- 
salem. Twice  already  in  the  Gospels,  once  of  the  whole  body 
of  believers  or  the  Kingdom  (Matt.  16:18),  the  other  of  the 
local  body  (Matt.  18:17).  In  Acts  7:38  it  is  used  of  the  whole 
congregation  of  Israel  while  in  19:32  it  is  used  of  a  public 
assembly  in  Ephesus.  But  already  in  Acts  8:3  it  is  applied  to 
the  church  which  Saul  was  persecuting  in  their  homes  when 
not  assembled.  So  here  the  etymological  meaning  of  "as- 
sembly" disappears  for  "the  church"  were  now  the  scat- 
tered saints  hiding  in  their  separate  homes.  The  whole  body 
of  believers  in  Jerusalem  and  all  who  heard  of  the  fate  of 
Ananias  and  Sapphira  (beautiful,  her  name  means)  were  in 
awe  and  dread.  It  was  already  a  dangerous  thing  to  be  a 
follower  of  Christ  unless  one  was  willing  to  walk  straight. 

12.  Were  wrought  {egineto).  Imperfect  middle,  wrought 
from  time  to  time.  With  one  accord  {homothumadon) .  As  al- 
ready in  1:14;  2:46; 4:24  and  later  7:57;  8:6;  12:20;  15:25;  18: 
21 ;  19 :29,  old  adverb  and  only  in  Acts  in  the  N.  T.  Here  "  all " 
is  added.  In  Solomon's  Porch  again  as  in  3  :ii  which  see. 


62        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

13.  Durst  {etolma).  Imperfect  active  of  tolmaOj  old  verb, 
not  to  fear  or  shun  through  fear,  boldly  to  take  a  stand. 
The  fate  of  Ananias  and  Sapphira  continued  to  hold  many  in 
check.  Join  {kollasthai) .  Present  middle  infinitive  of  kollao, 
old  verb  to  cleave  to  like  glue  as  in  Luke  15:15  which  see. 
Seven  times  in  Acts  (9:26;  10:28;  17:34).  The  outsiders 
(the  rest)  preferred,  many  of  them,  to  remain  outside  for 
the  present,  especially  the  rulers.  Howheit  the  people  {aW — ho 
laos).  Probably  individuals  among  the  people,  the  populace 
as  distinct  from  the  rulers  and  hostile  outsiders. 

14.  Were  the  more  added  {mallon  prosetithento) .  Rather 
(mdllon)  instead  of  decrease  as  one  might  expect.  Imperfect 
passive  indicative  of  prostithemi  common  mi  verb,  kept  on 
being  added.  Both  of  men  and  women  {andron  te  kai  gunai- 
kon).  The  distinction  between  andres  and  gunaikes  and  to 
be  considered  in  connection  with  andres  in  4:4  which  see. 

15.  Insomuch  that  (hoste).  With  the  present  infinitive 
ekpherein  and  tithenai,  regular  Greek  idiom  for  result.  Into 
the  streets  {eis  tas  plateias).  Supply  hodous  (ways),  into  the 
broad  ways.  On  beds  and  couches  {epi  klinarion  kai  kra- 
hatton).  Little  beds  (klinaria  diminutive  of  kline)  and  camp 
beds  or  pallets  (see  on  Mark  2:4,  9,  11).  As  Peter  came  by 
{erchomenou  Petrou).  Genitive  absolute  with  present  middle 
participle.  At  the  least  his  shadow  might  overshadow  (kan  he 
skia  episkiasei).  Future  active  indicative  with  hina  (com- 
mon with  hop  OS  in  ancient  Greek)  and  kan  (crasis  for  kai 
ean  =  even  if),  even  if  only  the  shadow.  The  word  for  shadow 
{skia,  like  our  "sky")  is  repeated  in  the  verb  and  preserved 
in  our  "overshadow."  There  was,  of  course,  no  virtue  or 
power  in  Peter's  shadow.  That  was  faith  with  superstition, 
of  course,  just  as  similar  cases  in  the  Gospels  occur  (Matt. 
9:20;  Mark  6:56;  John  9:5)  and  the  use  of  Paul's  handker- 
chief (Acts  19:12).  God  honours  even  superstitious  faith 
if  it  is  real  faith  in  him.  Few  people  are  wholly  devoid  of 
superstition. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  AFOSTLES  63 

16.  Came  together  (sunercheto) .  Imperfect  middle,  kept  on 
coming.  Round  about  (perix).  Old  adverb,  strengthened 
form  of  peri  J  only  here  in  the  N.T.  Vexed  (ochloumenous). 
Present  passive  participle  of  ochleOj  to  excite  a  mob  (ochlos) 
against  one,  to  trouble,  annoy.  Old  word,  only  here  in  the 
N.T.,  though  enochleo  in  Luke  6:18.  Were  healed  every  one 
(etherapeuonto  hapantes).  Imperfect  passive,  were  healed 
one  at  a  time,  repetition. 

17.  Which  is  the  sect  of  the  Sadducees  (he  ousa  hairesis  ton 
Saddoukaion) .  Literally,  "the  existing  sect  of  the  Sad- 
ducees" or  "the  sect  which  is  of  the  Sadducees,"  he  being  the 
article,  not  the  relative.  Hairesis  means  a  choosing,  from 
haireomaij  to  take  for  oneself,  to  choose,  then  an  opinion 
chosen  or  tenet  (possibly  II  Pet.  2:1),  then  parties  or  fac- 
tions (Gal.  5:20;  I  Cor.  11:19;  possibly  II  Peter  2:1).  It  is 
applied  here  to  the  Sadducees;  to  the  Pharisees  in  Acts  15 :5; 
26:5;  to  the  Christians  In  24:5-14  and  28:22.  Already  Luke 
has  stated  that  the  Sadducees  started  the  persecution  of 
Peter  and  John  (Acts  4: if.).  Now  it  is  extended  to  "the 
apostles"  as  a  whole  since  Christianity  has  spread  more 
rapidly  in  Jerusalem  than  before  it  began. 

18.  With  jealousy  (zelou).  Genitive  case.  Old  word  from 
zeOf  to  boil,  our  zeal.  In  itself  it  means  only  warmth,  ardour, 
zeal,  but  for  a  bad  cause  or  from  a  bad  motive,  jealousy, 
envy,  rivalry  results  (Acts  13:45).  Common  in  the  epistles. 
In  public  ward  {en  teresei  demosidi).  As  in  4:3  only  with 
demosidi  (public)  added,  in  the  public  prison,  perhaps  not 
the  "common"  prison,  but  any  prison  is  bad  enough.  In 
verse  19  it  is  called  "the  prison"  {tes  phulakes),  the  guard- 
house. 

20.  And  stand  {kai  stathentes).  First  aorist  passive  par- 
ticiple (intransitive,  ingressive  aorist),  take  a  stand.  Bold 
and  pictorial  command.  All  the  words  of  this  life  (panta  ta 
rhemata  tes  zoes  tautes).  Not  just  a  Hebraism  for  "all  these 
words  of  life."    Probably  "this  life"  which  the  Sadducees 


64        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

deny  and  of  which  the  angel  is  now  speaking,  this  eternal 
life.    (John  6:63,  68;  I  Cor.  15:19). 

21.  About  daybreak  {hupo  ton  orthron).  From  ornumi,  to 
stir  up,  to  arouse,  so  the  dawn  (Luke  24:1;  John  8:2).  Old 
word,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  these  three  passages.  "Under 
the  dawn"  or  "about  dawn."  Sub  lucem.  The  temple  doors 
would  be  open  for  early  worshippers  and  traffickers  (John 
2:14).  Taught  {edidaskon).  Imperfect  active,  began  to  teach. 
The  council  {to  sunedrion).  The  Sanhedrin.  The  senate  {ten 
gerousian).  From  geron,  an  old  man,  just  as  the  Latin  senatus 
is  from  senex,  old.  Like  the  gerontes  in  Homer  and  the  Elder 
Statesmen  in  Japan.  Apparently  the  senate  of  the  people 
were  also  part  of  the  Sanhedrin  and  the  use  of  "and"  {kai) 
is  explanatory  and  adds  this  item  in  particular.  Page  thinks 
that  this  group  of  elders  were  not  members  of  the  Sanhedrin 
at  all.  To  the  prison  house  {eis  to  desmoterion)^  another  word 
for  prison  {teresis  demosia  in  verse  18,  he  phulake  in  verse  19). 
See  also  verses  22,  23,  25.  This  from  desmosy  bond,  and  tereo, 
to  keep,  place  where  bound  men  are  kept. 

22.  The  oficers  {hoi  huperetai).  Under-rowers,  literally 
(Matt.  5:25).  The  servants  or  officers  who  executed  the 
orders  of  the  Sanhedrin.  Shut  {kekleismenon).  Perfect  pas- 
sive participle  of  kleio.  Shut  tight.  Standing  at  the  doors 
{hestotas  epi  ton  thurbn).  Graphic  picture  of  the  sentinels 
at  the  prison  doors. 

24.  They  were  much  perplexed  {dieporoun).  Imperfect 
active  of  diaporeo  old  verb  by  Luke  only  in  the  N.T.  See 
already  on  Acts  2:12.  They  continued  puzzled.  Whereunto 
this  would  grow  {ti  an  genoito  touto).  More  exactly,  As  to  what 
this  would  become.  Second  aorist  middle  optative  of  ginomai 
with  an,  the  conclusion  of  a  condition  of  the  fourth  class 
(undetermined  with  less  Hkelihood  of  determination),  the 
unexpressed  condition  being  "if  the  thing  should  be  allowed 
to  go  on."  The  indirect  question  simply  retains  the  optative 
with  an  (Robertson,  Grammar^  pp.    1021,    1044).     If  they

had  only  known  how  this  grain  of  mustard  seed  would  grow 
into  the  greatest  tree  on  earth  and  how  dwarfed  the  tree  of 
Judaism  would  be  beside  it! 

26.  Brought  {egen).  Imperfect  active  of  ago^  was  bringing 
(leading),  slowly  no  doubt,  and  solemnly.  But  without 
violence  (ou  meta  bias).  Literally,  not  with  violence.  For 
they  feared  (ephobounto  gar).  Imperfect  middle,  still  feared, 
kept  on  fearing.  Lest  they  be  stoned  (me  lithasthosin).  Nega- 
tive purpose  with  me  (like  hina  me),  probably  with  "not 
with  violence,"  though  possible  with  "they  feared."  They 
handled  the  apostles  gently  for  fear  of  being  stoned  them- 
selves by  the  people.  First  aorist  passive  subjunctive  of 
lithazo  (from  lithos,  stone),  old  verb  to  pelt  with  stones  (Acts 
14:19;  John  10:31-33). 

27.  They  set  them  (estesan).  First  aorist  active  indicative 
(transitive)  of  histemi. 

28.  fFe  straitly  charged  {Paraggelidi  pareggeilamen).  Like 
the  Hebrew  idiom  (common  in  the  LXX),  though  found  in 
Greek,  with  charging  (instrumental  case)  we  charged  (cf. 
same  idiom  in  Luke  22:15).  Somewhat  like  the  cognate 
accusative.  The  command  referred  to  occurs  in  Acts  4:17 
and  18  and  the  refusal  of  Peter  and  John  in  4:20.  To  bring 
upon  us  {epagagein  epW  hemds).  Note  repetition  of  epi.  Sec- 
ond aorist  active  infinitive  of  epago,  old  verb,  but  in  the 
N.T.  only  here  and  II  Pet.  2:1,  5.  The  Sanhedrin  gladly  took 
the  blood  of  Christ  on  their  heads  and  their  children  to 
Pilate  (Matt.  27:25).  Paul  tried  to  save  the  Jews  (Acts  18:6; 
22:20).  "  This  man^^  (tou  anthropou  toutou).  Contemptuous 
slur  and  refusal  to  call  the  name  of  Jesus  as  in  the  Talmud 
later. 

29.  We  must  (dei).  Moral  necessity  left  them  no  choice. 
They  stood  precisely  where  Peter  and  John  were  when  be- 
fore the  Sanhedrin  before  (Acts  4:20).  Obey  (peitharchein). 
Old  verb  from  peithomai  and  arche,  to  obey  a  ruler.  Only  by 
Luke  and  Paul  in  the  N.T.

30.  Ye  slew  {diecheirisasthe).  First  aorist  middle  indic- 
ative of  diacheirizomai,  old  verb  from  dia  and  cheir  (hand), 
to  take  in  hand,  manage,  to  lay  hands  on,  manhandle,  kill. 
In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  26:21.  Hanging  him  upon  a 
tree  {kremasanies  epi  xulou).  First  aorist  active  participle 
of  kremannumi  {kremannuo  seen  already  in  Matt.  18:6  and 
Luke  23:39).  Peter  refers  to  Deut.  21:23  ^s.  Paul  does  in 
Gal.  3:13,  the  curse  pronounced  on  every  one  who  "hangs 
upon  a  tree." 

31.  Exalt  (upsosen).  In  contrast  to  their  murder  of  Christ 
as  in  2:23f.  Peter  repeats  his  charges  with  increased  bold- 
ness. fVith  his  right  hand  {tei  dexidi  autou).  So  instrumental 
case,  or  at  his  right  hand  (locative  case),  or  even  "to  his 
right  hand"  (dative  case)  as  in  2:33.  Prince  and  Saviour 
{archegon  kai  sotera).  See  on  3:15.  Clearly  "Prince"  here. 
To  give  {tou  dounai).  Genitive  of  articular  infinitive  (second 
aorist  active  of  didbmi)  of  purpose. 

32.  We  are  witnesses  {hemeis  esmen  martures).  As  in  2:32. 
Things  (rhematon).  Literally,  sayings,  but  like  the  Hebrew 
dabhar  for  "word"  it  is  here  used  for  "things."  And  so  is  the 
Holy  Ghost  {kai  to  pneuma  to  hagion).  The  word  for  "is" 
(estin)  is  not  in  the  Greek,  but  this  is  plainly  the  meaning. 
Peter  claims  the  witness  of  the  Holy  Spirit  to  the  raising  of 
Jesus  Christ,  God's  Son,  by  the  Father. 

33.  Were  cut  to  the  heart  (dieprionto).  Imperfect  passive 
of  diaprio  old  verb  {dia,  prio),  to  saw  in  two  {dia),  to  cut  in 
two  (to  the  heart).  Here  it  is  rage  that  cuts  into  their  hearts, 
not  conviction  of  sin  as  in  Acts  2:37.  Only  hero  and  Acts 
7:54  (after  Stephen's  speech)  in  the  N.T.  (cf.  Simeon's 
prophecy  in  Luke  2:35).  Were  minded  {eboulonto).  Imper- 
fect middle  of  boulomai.  They  were  plotting  and  planning 
to  kill  {anelein,  as  in  Acts  2:23  and  Luke'23:33  which  see) 
then  and  there.  The  point  in  4:7  was  whether  the  apostles 
deserved  stoning  for  curing  the  cripple  by  demoniacal  power, 
but  here  it  was  disobedience  to  the  command  of  the  San- 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  67 

hedrin  which  was  not  a  capital  offence.   "They  were  on  the 
point  of  committing  a  grave  judicial  blunder"  (Furneaux). 

34.  Gamaliel  (Gamaliel).  The  grandson  of  Hillel,  teacher 
of  Paul  (Acts  22:3),  later  president  of  the  Sanhedrin,  and 
the  first  of  the  seven  rabbis  termed  "Rabban."  It  is  held  by 
some  that  he  was  one  of  the  doctors  who  heard  the  Boy 
Jesus  in  the  temple  (Luke  2:47)  and  that  he  was  a  secret 
disciple  like  Joseph  of  Arimathea  and  Nicodemus,  but  there 
is  no  evidence  of  either  position.  Besides,  he  appears  here  as 
a  loyal  Pharisee  and  "a  doctor  of  the  law"  {nomodidaskalos). 
This  word  appears  already  in  Luke  5:17  of  the  Pharisaic 
doctors  bent  on  criticizing  Jesus,  which  see.  Paul  uses  it  of 
Judaizing  Christians  (I  Tim.  1 7).  Like  other  great  rabbis 
he  had  a  great  saying:  "Procure  thyself  a  teacher,  avoid 
being  in  doubt;  and  do  not  accustom  thyself  to  give  tithes 
by  guess."  He  was  a  man  of  judicial  temper  and  not  prone 
to  go  off  at  a  tangent,  though  his  brilliant  young  pupil  Saul 
went  to  the  limit  about  Stephen  without  any  restraint  on 
the  part  of  Gamaliel  so  far  as  the  record  goes.  Gamaliel 
champions  the  cause  of  the  apostles  as  a  Pharisee  to  score  a 
point  against  the  Sadducees.  He  acts  as  a  theological  oppor- 
tunist, not  as  a  disciple  of  Christ.  He  felt  that  a  temporizing 
policy  was  best.  There  are  difficulties  in  this  speech  of 
Gamaliel  and  it  is  not  clear  how  Luke  obtained  the  data  for 
the  address.  It  is,  of  course,  possible  that  Saul  was  present 
and  made  notes  of  it  for  Luke  afterwards.  Had  in  honour  of 
all  the  people  {timios  panti  toi  laoi).  Ethical  dative.  Timios 
from  time,  old  word  meaning  precious,  dear.  The  men  (tons 
anthropous).  Correct  text  as  in  verse  35,  not  "the  apostles" 
as  Textus  Receptus. 

35.  Take  heed  {prosechete  heautois).  Hold  your  ^mind 
{noun,  unexpressed)  for  or  on  yourselves  (dative  case),  the 
usual  idiom. 

36.  Theudas  (Theudas).  Luke  represents  Gamaliel  here 
about  A.D.  35  as  speaking  of  a  man  who  led  a  revolt  before

that  of  Judas  the  Galilean  in  connection  with  the  enrolment 
under  Quirinius  (Cyrenius)  in  a.d.  6.  But  Josephus  {j4nt. 
XX.  5,  i)  tells  of  a  Theudas  who  led  a  similar  insurrection 
in  the  reign  of  Claudius  about  a.d.  44  or  45.  Josephus  (Ant. 
XVIII.  I,  6;  XX.  5,  2;  War  ii.  8,  I  and  17,  8)  also  describes 
Judas  the  Galilean  or  Gaulonite  and  places  him  about  a.d. 
6.  It  is  not  certain  that  Josephus  and  Luke  (Gamaliel) 
refer  to  the  same  Theudas  as  the  name  is  an  abbreviation  of 
Theodosus,  a  common  name.  "Josephus  gives  an  account 
of  four  men  named  Simon  who  followed  each  other  within 
forty  years,  and  of  three  named  Judas  within  ten  years, 
who  were  all  instigators  of  rebellion"  (Hackett).  If  the  same 
Theudas  is  meant,  then  either  Josephus  or  Luke  (Gamaliel) 
has  the  wrong  historical  order.  In  that  case  one  will  credit 
Luke  or  Josephus  according  to  his  estimate  of  the  two  as 
reliable  historians.  To  be  somebody  (einai  tina).  Indirect 
assertion  with  the  infinitive  and  the  accusative  of  general 
reference  iheauton)  and  tina,  predicate  accusative.  Tina 
could  be  "anybody"  or  "somebody"  according  to  context, 
clearly  "somebody"  of  importance  here.  Joined  themselves 
(proseklithe).  Correct  text  and  not  prosekollethe  (Textus 
Reccptus).  First  aorist  passive  indicative  of  prosklino^  old 
verb  to  lean  towards,  to  incline  towards.  Here  only  in  the 
N.T.  Was  slain  (aneirethe).  First  aorist  passive  of  anaireo 
(cf.  verse  33).  Obeyed  (epeithonto).  Imperfect  middle,  kept 
on  obeying.  Were  dispersed  (dieluthesan).  First  aorist  pas- 
sive indicative  (effective  aorist)  of  dialuo,  old  verb  to  dis- 
solve, to  go  to  pieces.    Here  only  in  the  N.T. 

37.  Of  the  enrolment  {tes  apographes).  Described  by 
Josephus  [Ant.  XV.  1,1).  The  same  word  used  by  Luke  of 
the  first  enrolment  started  by  Augustus  B.C.  8  to  6  (Luke  2:2). 
See  the  discussion  on  Luke  2:2.  This  is  the  second  enrolment 
in  the  fourteen  year  cycle  carried  on  for  centuries  as  shown 
by  numerous  dated  papyri.  Ramsay  {The  Bearing  of  Recent 
Discovery  on  the  Trustworthiness  of  the  N.T.)  has  produced

proof  from  inscriptions  that  Quirinius  was  twice  in  Syria  as 
Luke  reports  (Robertson,  Luke  the  Historian  in  the  Light 
of  Research).  Drew  away  (apestese).  Causative  sense  of  the 
first  aorist  active  indicative  of  aphistemi^  made  people  {laon, 
no  need  of  "some  of  the")  to  revolt  (apostatize)  with

also.  JVere  scattered  abroad  (dieskorpisthesan).  First  aorist 
(effective)  passive  indicative  of  diaskorpizo,  old  verb  to 
disperse.  Used  of  sheep  (Mark  14:27),  of  property  (Luke 
15:13).  Aorist  here  after  imperfect  {epeithonto)  as  in  verse  36. 

38.  Refrain  from  (apostete  apo).  Second  aorist  (ingressive) 
active  imperative  of  aphistemi  of  verse  37.  Do  ye  stand  off 
from  these  men.  "Hands  off"  was  the  policy  of  Gamaliel. 
For  if — be  {hoti  ean — ei).  Hoti  gives  the  reason  for  the  advice. 
Gamaliel  presents  two  alternatives  in  terms  of  two  condi- 
tional clauses.  The  first  one  is  stated  as  a  condition  of  the 
third  class,  ean  with  the  present  subjunctive  ei,  undeter- 
mined with  prospect  of  determination.  Assuming  that  it  is 
from  men,  *'it  will  be  overthrown"  (katalutheseiai,  first 
future  passive  of  kataluo,  to  loosen  down  like  a  falling  house) 
as  was  true  of  the  following  of  Theudas  and  Judas  the 
Galilean. 

39.  But  if  it  is  of  God  {ei  de  ek  theou  estin).  The  second  alter- 
native is  a  condition  of  the  first  class,  determined  as  ful- 
filled, ei  with  the  present  indicative.  By  the  use  of  this  idiom 
Gamaliel  does  put  the  case  more  strongly  in  favor  of  the 
apostles  than  against  them.  This  condition  assumes  that  the 
thing  is  so  without  affirming  it  to  be  true.  On  the  basis  of 
this  alternative  Gamaliel  warns  the  Sanhedrin  that  they 
cannot  "overthrow"  (katalusai)  these  men  for  they  in  that 
case  must  "overthrow"  God,  lest  haply  ye  be  found  {me 
pote — hurethete,  negative  purpose  with  first  aorist  passive 
subjunctive)  even  to  be  fighting  against  God  {kai  theomachoiy 
late  adjective  from  iheos  and  machomai,  in  LXX  and  here 
only  in  the  N.T.). 


70        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

40.  To  him  they  agreed  {epeisthesan  autoi).  First  aorist 
passive  indicative  of  peitho,  to  persuade,  the  passive  to  be 
persuaded  by,  to  listen  to,  to  obey.  Gamaliel's  shrewd  ad- 
vice scored  as  against  the  Sadducaic  contention  (verse  17). 
Not  to  speak  {me  lalein).  The  Sanhedrin  repeated  the  prohi- 
bition of  4:18  which  the  apostles  had  steadily  refused  to 
obey.  The  Sanhedrin  stood  by  their  guns,  but  refused  to 
shoot.  It  was  a  "draw"  with  Gamaliel  as  tactical  victor 
over  the  Sadducees.  Clearly  now  the  disciples  were  set 
free  because  only  the  Sadducees  had  become  enraged  while 
the  Pharisees  held   aloof. 

41.  They  therefore  {hoi  men  oun).  No  answering  de.  They 
were  counted  worthy  to  suffer  dishonour  for  the  Name  {kat- 
exiothesan  huper  ton  onomatos  atimasthenai) .  First  aorist 
passive  indicative  of  kataxioo,  old  verb  to  count  worthy. 
Three  times  in  N.T.  (Luke  20:35;  Acts  5:41;  II  Thess.  1:5). 
First  aorist  passive  infinitive  of  atimazo,  old  verb  to  make  one 
dishonoured  {atimos).  Forms  here  an  oxymoron  {oxus^  sharp, 
moros,  foolish)  pointedly  foolish  saying  "which  is  witty  or 
impressive  through  sheer  contradiction  or  paradox  as  labo- 
rious idleness,  sublime  indifference"  (Vincent).  The  apostles 
felt  honoured  by  dishonour.  Note  the  same  use  of  "the 
Name"  as  in  James  2:7;  III  John  7.  With  the  Jews  this  ab- 
solute use  of  "the  Name"  meant  Jehovah.  The  Christians 
now  apply  it  to  Jesus. 

42.  Every  day  {pdsan  hemeran).  Accusative  of  extent  of 
time,  all  through  every  day.  In  the  temple  and  at  home  {en 
tbi  hieroi  kai  kai*  oikon).  This  was  a  distinct  triumph  to  go 
back  to  the  temple  where  they  had  been  arrested  (verse  25) 
and  at  home  or  from  house  to  house,  as  it  probably  means 
(cf.  2:46).  It  was  a  great  day  for  the  disciples  in  Jerusalem. 
They  ceased  not  {ouk  epauonto).  Imperfect  middle.  They  kept 
it  up.  Jesus  as  the  Christ  {ton  Christon  lesoun).  Jesus  is  the 
direct  object  of  the  participles  didaskontes  (teaching)  and 
euaggelizomenoi    (preaching    or    evangelizing)    while    "the 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  7 1 

Christ"  {ton  Christon)  is  the  predicate  accusative.  These 
words  give  the  substance  of  the  early  apostolic  preaching  as 
these  opening  chapters  of  Acts  show,  that  Jesus  of  Nazareth 
is  the  Messiah  of  promise.  Gamaliel  had  opened  the  prison 
doors  for  them  and  they  took  full  advantage  of  the  opportu- 
nity that  now  was  theirs. 


CHAPTER  VI 

I.  fVhen  the  number  of  the  disciples  was  multiplying  {pie- 
thunontbn  ton  mathetbn).  Genitive  absolute  of  plethuno,  old 
verb  from  plethos,  fulness,  to  increase.  The  new  freedom  from 
the  intercession  of  Gamaliel  was  bearing  rich  fruit.  J  mur- 
muring of  the  Grecian  Jews  {goggusmos  ton  Helleniston).  Late 
onomatopoetic  word  (LXX)  from  the  late  verb  gogguzd,  to 
mutter,  to  murmur.  The  substantive  occurs  also  in  John 
7:12;  Phil.  2:14;  I  Peter  4:9.   Itjs  the  secret  grumblings^that 

buzz,  awav  till  they  are  heard. These  "Grecian  Jews"  or 

Hellenists  are  members  of  the  church  in  Jerusalem  who  are 
Jews  from  outside  of  Palestine  like  Barnabas  from  Cyprus. 
These  Hellenists  had  points  of  contact  with  the  Gentile 
world  without  having  gone  over  to  the  habits  of  the  Gentiles, 
the  Jews  of  the  Western  Dispersion.  They  spoke  Greek. 
Against  the  Hebrews  {pros  tous  Ebraious).  The  Jewish 
Christians  from  Jerusalem  and  Palestine.  The  Aramaean 
Jews  of  the  Eastern  Dispersion  are  usually  classed  with  the 
Hebrew  (speaking  Aramaic)  as  distinct  from  the  Grecian 
Jews  or  Hellenists.  Were  neglected  {paretheorounto) .  Imper- 
fect passive  of  paratheoreo,  old  verb,  to  examine  things 
placed  beside  (para)  each  other,  to  look  beyond  {para  also), 
To  overlook,  to  neglect.  Here  only  in  the  N.T.  These  widows 
may  receive  daily  {kathemerinei,  late  adjective  from  kath* 
hemeran,  only  here  in  the  N.T.)  help  from  the  common  fund 
provided  for  all  who  need  it  (Acts  4:32-37).  The  temple 
funds  for  widows  were  probably  not  available  for  those  who 
have  now  become  Christians.  Though  they  were  all  Chris- 
tians here  concerned,  yet  the  same  line  of  cleavage  existed 
as  among  the  other  Jews  (Hebrew  or  Aramaean  Jews  and 
Hellenists).     It  is  not  here  said  that  the  murmuring  arose

among  the  widows,  but  because  of  them.  Women  and  money 
occasion  the  first  serious  disturbance  in  the  church  life.  There 
was  evident  sensitiveness  that  called  for  wisdom. 

2.  The  multitude  {to  plethos).  The  whole_church,  not  just 
the  120.  Fil  (areston).  Pleasing,  verbal  adjective  from 
areskoj  to  please,  old  word,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and 
Acts  12:3;  John  8:29;  I  John  3:22.  Non  placet.  Should  for- 
sake (kataleipsantas).  Late  first  aorist  active  participle  for 
usual  second  aorist  katalipontas  from  kataleipo,  to  leave 
behind.  Serve  tables  (diakonein  trapezais).  Present  active 
infinitive  of  diakoneo  from  diakonos  {dia  and  konis,  dust), 
to  raise  a  dust  in  a  hurry,  to  serve,  to  minister  either  at 
table  (John  12:20),  or  other  service  (John  I2:25f.),  to  serve  as 
deacon  (I  Tim.  3:10,  13).  "Tables"  here  hardly  means 
money-tables  as  in  John  2:15,  but  rather  the  tables  used  in 
the  common  daily  distribution  of  the  food  (possibly  including 
the  love-feasts.  Acts  2:43-47).  This  word  is  the  same  root 
as  diakonia  (ministration)  in  verse  i  and  deacon  {diakonos) 
in  Phil.  I  :i  and  I  Tim.  3 :8-i3.  It  is  more  frequently  used  in 
the  N.T.  of  ministers  (preachers)  than  of  deacons,  but  it  is 
quite  possible,  even  probable,  that  the  office  of  deacon  as 
separate  from  bishop  or  elder  grew  out  of  this  incident  in 
Acts  6:1-7.  Furneaux  is  clear  that  these  "seven"  are  not 
to  be  identified  with  the  later  "deacons"  but  why  he  does 
not  make  clear. 

3.  Of  good  report  {marturoumenous).  Present  passive  parti- 
ciple of  martureo,  to  bear  witness  to.  Men  with  a  good  reputa- 
tion as  well  as  with  spiritual  gifts  (the  Holy  Spirit  and 
wisdom).  fVe  may  appoint  {kataste somen).  Future  active 
indicative  of  kathistemi,  we  shall  appoint.  The  action  of  the 
apostles  follows  the  choice  by  the  church,  but  it  is  promised 
as  a  certainty,  not  as  a  possibility.  The  Textus  Receptus  has 
a  first  aorist  active  subjunctive  here  {katastesomen). 

4.  But  we  {hemeis  de).  In  contrast  to  the  work  given  the 
seven.   The  ministry  of  the  word  {tei  diakonidi  tou  logou).  The 


74        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

same  word  diakonidi  employed  in  verse  i,  but  here  about 
preaching  as  the  special  ministry  with  which  the  apostles 
were  concerned.  For  "continue  steadfastly"  (proskar- 
Uresomen)  see  on  2:42. 

5.  Pleased  (eresen).  Aorist  active  indicative  of  aresko 
like  Latin  placuit  when  a  vote  was  taken.  The  use  of  endpion 
before  "the  whole  multitude"  is  like  the  LXX.  They  chose 
(exelexanto).  First  aorist  middle  indicative  of  eklegOj  to  pick 
out  for  oneself.  Each  one  of  the  seven  has  a  Greek  name  and 
was  undoubtedly  a  Hellenist,  not  an  Aramaean  Jew.  Con- 
summate wisdom  is  here  displayed  for  the  murmuring  had 
come  from  the  Hellenists,  seven  of  whom  were  chosen  to 
take  proper  care  of  the  widows  of  Hellenists.  This  trouble 
was  settled  to  stay  settled  so  far  as  we  know.  Nothing  is 
here  told  of  any  of  the  seven  except  Stephen  who  is  "a  man 
full  of  faith  and  the  Holy  Spirit"  and  Nicolas  "a  proselyte 
of  Antioch  "  (who  was  not  then  born  a  Jew,  but  had  come  to 
the  Jews  from  the  Greek  world). 

6.  They  laid  their  hands  on  them  (epethekan  autois  tas 
cheiras).  First  aorist  active  indicative  of  epitithemi.  Prob- 
ably by  the  apostles  who  ratified  the  choice  (verse  3).  The 
laying  on  of  hands  "was  a  symbol  of  the  impartation  of  the 
gifts  and  graces  which  they  needed  to  qualify  them  for  the 
office.  It  was  of  the  nature  of  a  prayer  that  God  would  be- 
stow the  necessary  gifts,  rather  than  a  pledge  that  they  were 
actually  conferred"   (Hackett). 

7.  Increased  (euxanen).  Imperfect  active,  kept  on  growing 
all  the  more  because  the  apostles  were  now  relieved  from 
the  daily  ministration  of  the  food.  Multiplied  (eplethuneto). 
Imperfect  passive.  The  two  imperfects  kept  pace  with  each 
other.  Of  the  priests  {ton  hierbn).  Who  were  usually  Sad- 
ducees.  It  was  a  sad  day  for  Annas  and  Caiaphas  and  all 
the  sect  of  the  Sadducees  (5:17).  Were  obedient  to  (hupe- 
kouon).  Imperfect  active  of  hupakoud,  repetition,  one  after 
another.     The  faith  (tei  pistei).     Here  meaning  the  gospel, 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  75 

the  faith  system  as  in  Rom.  1:5;  Gal.  1:23;  Jude  3,  etc. 
Here  the  word  means  more  than  individual  trust  in  Christ. 

8.  Wrought  (epoiei).  Imperfect  active,  repeatedly  wrought. 
Evidently  a  man  like  Stephen  would  not  confine  his  "minis- 
try" to  "serving  tables."  He  was  called  in  verse  5  "full  of 
faith  and  the  Holy  Spirit."  Here  he  is  termed  "full  of 
grace  (so  the  best  MSS.,  not  faith)  and  power."  The  four 
words  give  a  picture  of  remarkable  attractiveness.  The  grace 
of  God  gave  him  the  power  and  so  "he  kept  on  doing  great 
wonders  and  signs  among  the  people."  He  was  a  sudden 
whirlwind  of  power  in  the  very  realm  of  Peter  and  John  and 
the  rest. 

9.  The  synagogue  of  the  Libertines  {ek  tes  sunagoges  tes 
legomenes  Liberiinon).  The  Libertines  (Latin  liberiinus,  a 
freedman  or  the  son  of  a  freedman)  were  Jews,  once  slaves 
of  Rome  (perhaps  descendants  of  the  Jews  taken  to  Rome 
as  captives  by  Pompey),  now  set  free  and  settled  in  Jeru- 
salem and  numerous  enough  to  have  a  synagogue  of  their 
own.  Schuerer  calls  a  Talmudic  myth  the  statement  that 
there  were  480  synagogues  in  Jerusalem.  There  were  many, 
no  doubt,  but  how  many  no  one  knows.  These  places  of 
worship  and  study  were  in  all  the  cities  of  the  later  times 
where  there  were  Jews  enough  to  maintain  one.  Apparently 
Luke  here  speaks  of  five  such  synagogues  in  Jerusalem 
(that  of  the  Libertines,  of  the  Cyrenians,  of  the  Alexan- 
drians, of  Cilicia,  and  of  Asia).  There  probably  were  enough 
Hellenists  in  Jerusalem  to  have  five  such  synagogues.  But 
the  language  of  Luke  is  not  clear  on  this  point.  He  may 
make  only  two  groups  instead  of  five  since  he  uses  the  article 
ton  twice  (once  before  Libertinon  kai  Kiirenaion  kai  Alex- 
andreon,  again  before  apo  Kilikias  kai  Asias).  He  also 
changes  from  the  genitive  plural  to  apo  before  Cilicia  and 
Asia.  But,  leaving  the  number  of  the  synagogues  unsettled 
whether  five  or  two,  it  is  certain  that  in  each  one  where 
Stephen  appeared  as  a  Hellenist  preaching  Jesus  as  the 


76        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Messiah  he  met  opposition.  Certain  of  them  ** arose" 
(anestesan)  "stood  up"  after  they  had  stood  all  that  they 
could  from  Stephen,  "disputing  with  Stephen"  {sunze- 
tountes  toi  Stephanoi).  Present  active  participle  of  sunzetedy 
to  question  together  as  the  two  on  the  way  to  Emmaus  did 
(Luke  24:15).  Such  interruptions  were  common  with  Jews. 
They  give  a  skilled  speaker  great  opportunity  for  reply 
if  he  is  quick  in  repartee.  Evidently  Stephen  was  fully 
equipped  for  the  emergency.  One  of  their  synagogues  had 
men  from  Cilicia  in  it,  making  it  practically  certain  that 
young  Saul  of  Tarsus,  the  brilliant  student  of  Gamaliel, 
was  present  and  tried  his  wits  with  Stephen.  His  igno- 
minious defeat  may  be  one  explanation  of  his  zest  in  the 
stoning  of  Stephen  (Acts  8:1). 

10.  They  were  not  able  to  withstand  {ouk  ischuon  antis- 
tenai).  Imperfect  active  of  ischuo,  to  have  strength,  and  in- 
gressive  second  aorist  active  (intransitive)  infinitive  of  an- 
thistemi.  They  continued  unable  (without  strength  enough) 
to  take  a  stand  against.  Stephen  knocked  them  down,  Saul 
included,  as  fast  as  they  got  up.  Stephen  was  like  a  battery 
charged  and  in  action.  The  wisdom  and  spirit  {tei  sophidi 
kai  pneumati).  Dative  case.  They  stood  up  against  Ste- 
phen's wisdom  and  the  Holy  Spirit  "by  whom  he  spoke" 
{hoi  elalei).  Instrumental  case  and  the  relative  agrees 
with  "Spirit."  He  kept  on  speaking  so  {elalei^  imperfect 
active).     It  was  a  desperate  situation. 

11.  Then  they  suborned  men  {tote  hupebalon  andras). 
Second  aorist  active  indicative  of  hupoballo,  old  verb,  but 
here  only  in  the  N.T.,  to  put  under  like  a  carpet,  to  bring 
men  under  one's  control  by  suggestion  or  by  money.  One 
recalls  the  plight  of  Caiaphas  in  the  trial  of  Jesus  when  he 
sought  false  witnesses.  Subornaverunt.  They  put  these  men 
forward  in  an  underhand  way  for  fraud.  Blasphemous 
words  against  Moses  and  God  {blasphema  eis  Mousen  kai 
ton  theon).    The  punishment  for  blasphemy  was  stoning  to 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  77 

death.  See  Matt.  12:31  for  discussion  of  the  word  hlasphe- 
mia,  blasphemed,  blasphemos,  all  in  the  N.T.  from  blapto, 
to  harm,  and  pheme,  speech,  harmful  speech,  or  blax,  stupid, 
and  pheme.  But  the  charge  against  Stephen  was  untrue. 
Please  note  that  Moses  is  here  placed  before  God  and  prac- 
tically on  a  par  with  God  in  the  matter  of  blasphemy.  The 
purpose  of  this  charge  is  to  stir  the  prejudices  of  the  people 
in  the  matter  of  Jewish  rights  and  privileges.  It  is  the  Phar- 
isees who  are  conducting  this  attack  on  Stephen  while  the 
Sadducees  had  led  them  against  Peter  and  John.  The  posi- 
tion of  Stephen  is  critical  in  the  extreme  for  the  Sadducees 
will  not  help  him  as  Gamaliel  did  the  apostles. 

12.  They  stirred  up  the  people  {sunekinesan  ton  laon). 
They  shook  the  people  together  like  an  earthquake.  First 
aorist  active  indicative  of  sunkineo,  to  throw  into  commo- 
tion. Old  verb,  but  here  only  in  the  N.T.  The  elders  and 
the  scribes  (Pharisees)  are  reached,  but  no  word  about  the 
Sadducees.  This  is  the  first  record  of  the  hostility  of  the 
masses  against  the  disciples  (Vincent).  Came  upon  him 
(epistantes) ,  Second  aorist  (ingressive)  active  participle  of 
ephistemi.  Rushed  at  him.  Seized  {sunerpasan) .  Effective 
aorist  active  of  sunarpazo  as  if  they  caught  him  after  pur- 
suit. 

13.  False  witnesses  [marturas  pseudeis).  Just  as  Caiaphas 
did  with  Jesus.  Ceaseth  not  (ou  pauetai).  Wild  charge  just 
like  a  false  witness  that  Stephen  talks  in  the  synagogues 
against  the  law  and  the  holy  temple. 

14.  We  have  heard  him  say  {akekoamen  autou  legontos). 
The  only  direct  testimony  and  evidently  wrong.  Curiously 
like  the  charge  brought  against  Jesus  before  Caiaphas  that 
he  would  destroy  the  temple  and  build  it  again  in  three  days. 
Undoubtedly  Stephen  had  said  something  about  Christi- 
anity before  as  meant  for  others  besides  Jews.  He  had  caught 
the  spirit  of  Jesus  about  worship  as  shown  to  the  woman  at 
Sychar  in  John  4  that  God  is  spirit  and  to  be  worshipped 


78        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

by  men  anywhere  and  everywhere  without  having  to  come 
to  the  temple  in  Jerusalem.  It  was  inflammable  material 
surely  and  it  was  easy  to  misrepresent  and  hard  to  clear  up. 
This  Jesus  of  Nazareth  {I e sous  ho  Nazoraios  houtos).  With 
contempt. 

15.  Js  if  the  face  of  an  angel  {hosei  prosopon  aggelou). 
Even  his  enemies  saw  that,  wicked  as  they  were.  See  Ex. 
34:30  for  the  face  of  Moses  when  he  came  down  from  Sinai 
(II  Cor.  3:7).  Page  quotes  Tennyson:  "God's  glory  smote 
him  on  the  face."  Where  were  Peter  and  John  at  this  crisis.^ 
Apparently  Stephen  stands  alone  before  the  Sanhedrin  as 
Jesus  did.  But  he  was  not  alone  for  he  saw  Jesus  standing 
at  the  right  hand  of  God  (Acts  7:56).  There  was  little  that 
Peter  and  John  could  have  done  if  they  had  been  present. 
Gamaliel  did  not  interpose  this  time  for  the  Pharisees  were 
behind  the  charges  against  Stephen,  false  though  they  were 
as  Gamaliel  could  have  found  out. 


CHAPTER  VII 

I.  Are  these  things  so?  {ei  tauta  houtos  echei).  On  this  use 
of  ei  in  a  direct  question  see  on  i:6.  Literally  "Do  these 
things  hold  thus?"  A  formal  question  by  the  high  priest  like 
our  "Do  you  plead  guilty,  or  not  guilty?"  (Furneaux). 
The  abrupt  question  of  the  high  priest  would  serve  to  break 
the  evident  spell  of  the  angelic  look  on  Stephen's  face.  Two 
charges  had  been  made  against  Stephen  (i)  speaking  against 
the  holy  temple,  (2)  changing  the  customs  which  Moses  had 
delivered.  Stephen  could  not  give  a  yes  or  no  answer  to  these 
two  charges.  There  was  an  element  of  truth  in  each  of  them 
and  a  large  amount  of  error  all  mixed  together.  So  he  under- 
takes to  explain  his  real  position  by  the  historical  method, 
that  is  to  say,  by  a  rapid  survey  of  God's  dealing  with  the 
people  of  Israel  and  the  Gentiles.  It  is  the  same  method 
adopted  by  Paul  in  Pisidian  Antioch  (Acts  i3:i6fF.)  after  he 
had  become  the  successor  of  Stephen  in  his  interpretation 
of  the  universal  mission  of  Christianity.  If  one  is  disposed 
to  say  that  Luke  made  up  this  speech  to  suit  Stephen's 
predicament,  he  has  to  explain  how  the  style  is  less  Lukan 
than  the  narrative  portions  of  Acts  with  knowledge  of 
Jewish  traditions  that  a  Greek  would  not  be  likely  to  know. 
Precisely  how  Luke  obtained  the  data  for  the  speech  we 
do  not  know,  but  Saul  heard  it  and  Philip,  one  of  the  seven, 
almost  certainly.  Both  could  have  given  Luke  help  about  it. 
It  is  even  possible  that  some  one  took  notes  of  this  impor- 
tant address.  We  are  to  remember  also  that  the  speech  was 
interrupted  at  the  end  and  may  not  include  all  that  Stephen 
meant  to  say.  But  enough  is  given  to  give  us  a  good  idea  of 
how  Stephen  met  the  first  charge  "by  showing  that  the  wor- 
ship of  God  is  not  confined   to  Jerusalem  or  the  Jewish 

79 


8o        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

temple"  (Page).  Then  he  answers  the  second  charge  by 
proving  that  God  had  many  dealings  with  their  fathers 
before  Moses  came  and  that  Moses  foretold  the  coming  of 
the  Messiah  who  is  now  known  to  be  Jesus.  It  is  at  this 
point  (verse  51)  that  Stephen  becomes  passionate  and  so 
powerful  that  the  wolves  in  the  Sanhedrin  lose  all  self- 
control.  It  is  a  great  and  masterful  exposition  of  the  world- 
wide mission  of  the  gospel  of  Christ  in  full  harmony  with 
the  Great  Commission  of  Christ.  The  apostles  had  been  so 
busy  answering  the  Sadducees  concerning  the  Resurrection 
of  Christ  and  maintaining  their  freedom  to  teach  and  preach 
that  they  had  not  pushed  the  world-wide  propaganda  of  the 
gospel  as  Jesus  had  commanded  after  they  had  received  the 
Promise  of  the  Father.  But  Stephen  had  proclaimed  the 
same  message  of  Christ  and  was  now  facing  the  same  fate. 
Peter's  mind  had  been  enlightened  by  the  Holy  Spirit  so 
that  he  could  rightly  interpret  Joel  and  David  in  the  light 
of  Pentecost.  "So  Stephen  read  the  history  of  the  Old 
Testament  with  new  eyes  in  the  light  of  the  life  and  death  of 
Jesus"  (Furneaux). 

2.  Brethren  and  fathers  {andres  adelphoi  kai  pater es). 
The  spectators  (brethren)  and  members  of  the  Sanhedrin 
(fathers)  as  Paul  in  Acts  22:1.  Hearken  (akousate).  First 
aorist  (ingressive)  active  imperative,  Give  me  your  attention 
now.  The  God  of  glory  (Ho  theos  tes  doxes).  The  God  char- 
acterized by  glory  (genitive  case,  genus  or  kind)  as  seen  in 
the  Shekinah,  the  visible  radiance  of  God.  Jesus  is  also 
called  "the  Glory "  =  the  Shekinah  in  James  2:1.  Cf.  Ex. 
25:22;  40:34;  Lev.  9:6;  Heb.  9:5.  By  these  words  Stephen 
refutes  the  charge  of  blasphemy  against  God  in  Acts  6:1 1. 
Appeared  (ophthe).  First  aorist  passive  indicative  of  horao. 
See  on  Luke  23:43.  Before  there  was  temple  or  tabernacle 
and  away  over  in  Mesopotamia  (Ur  of  the  Chaldees,  Gen. 
11:31),  even  before  (prin  e  with  the  infinitive)  he  dwelt  in 
Haran    (Charran,  or   Carrae   not  far  from   Edessa,   where 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  8 1 

Crassus  met  death  after  his  defeat  by  the  Parthians  B.C.  53). 

3.  Which  I  shall  shew  thee  {hen  an  soi  deixo).  Indefinite 
relative  clause  with  an  and  the  aorist  active  subjunctive 
(same  form  in  first  person  singular  as  the  future  active  indic- 
ative).    Abraham  followed  on  as  God  led  him. 

4.  When  his  father  was  dead  (meta  to  apothanein  anion). 
Meta  with  the  accusative  of  the  articular  infinitive  and  the 
accusative  of  general  reference  {auton),  regular  Greek  idiom. 
In  Gen.  11:32  it  is  stated  that  Terah  died  at  Haran  at  the 
age  of  205.  There  are  various  explanations  of  the  discrep- 
ancy, but  no  one  that  seems  certain.  It  is  possible  (Hackett, 
Felten)  that  Abraham  h  mentioned  first  in  Gen.  11:26 
because  he  became  the  most  prominent  and  was  really 
younger  than  Haran  his  brother  who  died  before  the  first 
migration  who  was  really  sixty  years  older  than  Abraham. 
According  to  this  view  Terah  was  130  years  old  at  the  birth 
of  Abraham,  leaving  Abraham  75  at  the  death  of  Terah  (205). 
Wherein  ye  now  dwell  {eis  hen  humeis  nun  kaioikeite).  Note 
eis  in  the  sense  of  en  as  often.  Note  also  emphatic  use  of 
humeis  (ye)  and  now  {nun). 

5.  Not  so  much  as  to  set  his  foot  on  {oude  hema  podos). 
From  Deut.  2:5.  Old  word  from  baino,  to  go,  to  step.  "Step- 
ping of  a  foot,"  only  instance  of  this  original  meaning  in  the 
N.T.  From  this  it  comes  to  mean  a  platform  reached  by 
steps,  official  seat  of  a  judge  (Matt.  27:19).  The  field  pur- 
chased by  Abraham  (Gen.  23 :9-i7)  was  not  a  gift  from  God. 
Promised  {epeggeilaio).  First  aorist  middle  indicative  of 
epaggello,  common  verb.  See  Gen.  12:7;  17:8;  48:4  for  this 
promise.  So  God  appeared  again  to  Abraham  in  a  strange 
land.  In  possession  {eis  kataschesin).  Late  word,  in  LXX, 
and  in  N.T.  only  here  and  verse  45.  From  katecho,  to  hold 
back,  then  to  hold  fast  {or  down),  to  possess.  It  was  ful- 
filled in  the  descendants  of  Abraham.  When  as  yet  he  had  no 
child  {ouk  ontos  autoi  teknou).  Genitive  absolute  with  nega- 
tive ouk  rather  than  me  to  emphasize  actual  absence  of  a 


82        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

child.    He  had  only  the  promise  of  God  about  the  land  and 
the  child. 

6.  On  this  wise  {houtos).  A  free  quotation  from  Gen.  15: 
13.  Should  sojourn  {estai  paroikon).  Shall  be  a  sojourner, 
Paroikos  {para^  beside,  oikos^  home),  one  dwelling  near  one's 
home,  but  not  of  it,  so  a  stranger,  foreigner,  old  word,  often 
in  LXX,  temporary  residence  without  full  rights  of  citizen- 
ship (7:29;  13:17),  and  descriptive  of  Christians  (Eph.  2:19; 
I  Peter  i  :I7;  2:11).  In  a  strange  land  {en  gei  allotridi).  In  a 
land  not  one's  own,  that  belongs  to  another,  alien  as  in  Matt. 
17 :25f.,  which  see.  Four  hundred  years  {ete  tetrakosia).  Ac- 
cusative of  duration  of  time.  As  in  Gen.  15:13,  but  a  round 
number  as  in  Ex.  12:40  the  time  is  430  years.  But  in  Gal. 
3:17  Paul,  following  the  LXX  in  Ex.  12:40,  takes  the  430 
years  to  cover  the  period  in  Canaan  and  the  stay  in  Egypt, 
cutting  the  sojourn  in  Egypt  to  about  half.  Josephus  gives 
it  both  ways.  Hackett  suggests  two  solutions,  one  that 
there  were  two  ways  of  reckoning  the  period  among  the  Jews 
with  no  way  of  settling  it,  the  other  that  by  the  430  years  in 
Egypt  the  writers  meant  to  include  Canaan  also  as  merely 
the  preliminary  to  the  period  in  Egypt. 

7.  Will  I  judge  {krino  ego).  Future  (accent  on  0)  active 
indicative  of  krino  and  ego  (I)  expressed  is  emphatic.  In 
this  place  {en  tbi  topoi  toutoi).  Quoted  from  Ex.  3:12  and 
referring  to  Sinai  or  Horeb,  but  Stephen  applies  it  to  the 
Promised  Land. 

8.  The  covenant  of  circumcision  (diatheken  peritomes).  A 
covenant  marked  by  (genitive)  circumcision  (no  article)  of 
which  circumcision  is  the  sign  (Rom.  4:11)  as  set  forth  in 
Gen.  17:9-14.  In  the  ancient  Greek  diaiheke  was  usually  will 
(Latin,  testamentum)  and  suntheke  was  used  for  covenant 
(jttn,  together,  rather  than  dia,  between).  But  the  LXX  and 
the  N.T.  use  diatheke  for  covenant  (will  in  Heb.  9:i5f.)  as 
Lightfoot  on  Gal.  3:16  says:  "The  LXX  translation  and 
New   Testament   writers    probably   preferred   diatheke   as

better  expressing  the  jree  grace  of  God  than  suntheke.'* 
And  so  {kai  houtos).  After  the  covenant  was  made  and  as  a 
sign  and  seal  of  it. 

9.  Moved  with  jealousy  (zelosanies).  First  aorist  active 
participle  of  zeloo,  old  verb  from  zelos  (Acts  5:17),  to  burn 
or  boil  with  zeal,  and  then  with  envy  as  here  (17:5,  etc.)  and 
Gen.   37:11. 

10.  Delivered  him  out  (exeilato  auton  ek).  First  aorist 
middle  indicative  of  exaireo,  old  verb  to  take  out,  snatch  out. 
Note  repetition  of  ek.  Pharaoh  King  of  Egypt  (Pharao 
basileos  Aiguptou).  Pharaoh  is  not  a  name,  but  a  title,  the 
Egyptian  perdd  meaning  great  house. 

11.  Found  no  sustenance  {ouch  heuriskon  chortasmata) .  Im- 
perfect active,  kept  on  not  finding.  Chortasmata  is  from 
chortazo,  originally  to  feed  with  grass  (chortos)  or  herbs.  Old 
word,  but  only  here  in  the  N.T.  and  includes  food  for  both 
men  and  animals.  In  Gen.  24:25,  32  it  is  fodder  for  the 
cattle,  a  first  necessity  for  owners  of  herds  of  cattle. 

12.  That  there  was  corn  {onta  sitia).  Participle  (present 
active  of  eimi)  in  indirect  discourse,  after  akousas,  "heard  of 
corn  being  in  Egypt."  Sitia  is  diminutive  of  sitos  and  means 
grain  (wheat,  barley,  not  our  maize  or  Indian  corn),  old 
word  also  for  provisions,  victuals,  here  only  in  the  N.T. 
The  first  time  (proton).  While  Jacob  himself  remained  in 
Canaan  before  he  went  down  to  Egypt  and  died  there 
(verse  I5f.). 

13.  At  the  second  time  {en  toi  deuteroi).  This  expression 
only  here  in  the  N.T.  This  second  visit  is  recorded  in  Gen. 
45 :ifF.  Became  manifest  {phaneron  egeneto).  In  Gen.  41  :I2  the 
fact  that  Joseph  was  a  Hebrew  had  been  incidentally  men- 
tioned to  Pharaoh,  but  now  it  was  made  clear  to  him. 

14.  Three-score  and  fifteen  souls  {en  psuchais  hehdomekonta 
pente).  Stephen  follows  the  LXX  which  counts  some  grand- 
children of  Joseph  and  so  makes  it  75  whereas  Gen.  46:26 
has  66  and  then  the  next  verse  makes  it  70  including  Jacob 


I

and  Joseph  with  his  two  sons.    The  use  of  en  means  "con- 
sisting in." 

1 6.  They  were  carried  over  unto  Shechem  (metetethesan  eis 
Suchem).  First  aorist  passive  of  metatithemi,  only  here  in  the 
N.T.  in  this  sense  of  changing  places.  Jacob  was  buried  in 
the  cave  of  Machpelah  (Gen.  50:13).  The  O.T.  does  not 
say  where  the  sons  of  Jacob  were  buried  save  that  Joseph 
was  buried  in  Shechem  Qosh.  24:32).  Possibly  only  "our 
fathers"  without  Jacob  is  the  subject  of  "were  carried." 
Which  Abraham  bought  {hoi  onesato  Abraam).  Hackett  is 
sure  that  our  present  text  is  wrong.  Hort  notes  some  sixty 
"primitive  errors"  in  the  critical  text  of  the  N.T.  It  is 
possible  that  this  is  also  one.  If  "Jacob"  is  substituted  for 
"Abraham,"  the  matter  is  cleared  up.  "It  is  quite  as  hkely, 
judging  a  priori,tha.t  the  word  producing  the  error  escaped 
from  some  early  copyist  as  that  so  glaring  an  error  was  com- 
mitted by  Stephen"  (Hackett).  At  any  rate  Abraham 
bought  a  burying-place,  the  cave  of  Machpelah,  from 
Ephron  the  Hittite  at  Hebron  (Gen.  23:16),  while  Jacob 
bought  a  field  from  the  sons  of  Hamor  at  Shechem  (Gen. 
33*19;  Josh.  24:32).  Abraham  had  built  an  altar  at  Shechem 
when  he  entered  Canaan  (Gen.  I2:6f.).  It  is  possible,  of 
course,  that  Abraham  also  bought  the  ground  on  which  the 
altar  stood.  In  Shechem  (en  Suchem).  This  is  the  reading 
of  Aleph  B  C  instead  of  the  Textus  Receptus  tou  Suchem 
which  makes  it  "Hamar  the  father  of  Sichem."  "In  She- 
chem" is  the  true  reading. 

17.  Drew  nigh  (eggizen).  Imperfect  active,  was  drawing 
nigh. 

18.  Another  king  {basileus  heteros).  A  different  kind  of 
king  also,  probably  a  king  of  the  new  dynasty  after  the 
shepherd  kings  had  been  expelled  from  Egypt.  Who  knew 
not  Joseph  (hos  ouk  eidei  ton  loseph).  Second  past  perfect  of 
oida  used  like  an  imperfect.  Joseph's  history  and  services 
meant  nothing  to  the  new  king.     "The  previous  dynasty 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  85 

had  been  that  of  the  Hyksos :  the  new  king  was  Ahmes  who 
drove  out  the  Hyksos"  (Knobel). 

19.  Dealt  subtilly  {katasophisamenos).  First  aorist  middle 
participle  of  katasophizomai,  late  compound  {kata  and 
sophizoy  old  verb,  to  make  wise,  to  become  wise,  then  to 
play  the  sophist),  perfective  use  of  kata.  In  the  LXX,  but 
here  only  in  the  N.T.  To  use  fraud,  craft,  deceit.  That  they 
should  cast  out  their  babes  (tou  poiein  ta  brephe  ektheta).  Tou 
poiein  (genitive  of  the  articular  present  infinitive) can  be 
either  design  or  result.  The  Revised  Version  here  takes  it  as 
purpose  while  the  Authorized  as  result.  In  either  case 
Pharaoh  required  the  Israelites  to  expose  their  children  to 
death,  a  possible  practice  done  voluntarily  in  heathen  China 
and  by  heathen  in  so-called  Christian  lands.  But  the  Is- 
raelites fought  against  such  an  iniquity.  The  word  ektheta 
(exposed,  cast  out)  is  a  verbal  adjective  from  ektithemi.  It  is 
an  old  word,  but  here  only  in  the  N.T.  and  not  in  the  LXX. 
To  the  end  they  might  not  live  {eis  to  me  zoogoneisthai).  Purpose 
with  eis  and  the  articular  infinitive  (present  middle).  This 
compound  verb  is  from  zoogonos  (from  zoos,  alive,  and  geno, 
to  bear)  and  is  used  by  late  writers  and  the  LXX.  It  is  three 
times  in  the  N.T.  (here,  Luke  17:33;  I  Tim.  6:13)  in  the 
sense  to  preserve  alive. 

20.  Exceeding  fair  {asteios  toi  theoi).  Ethical  dative,  fair 
to  God  (as  God  looked  at  him).  Asteios  is  from  astu,  city, 
and  so  means  "of  the  city,"  with  city  manners  and  polish. 
Old  word,  only  twice  in  the  N.T.  (here  and  Heb.  1 1 :23)  and 
both  times  about  Moses  and  taken  from  Ex.  2:2.  He  was 
nourished  (anetraphe).  Second  aorist  passive  indicative  of 
anatrepho.  He  was  brought  up  at  home  for  three  months  in 
defiance  of  the  new  Pharaoh. 

21.  When  he  was  cast  out  {ektethentos  autou).  Genitive 
absolute  with  first  aorist  passive  participle  of  ektithemi. 
Took  up  (aneilato).  Second  aorist  middle  indicative  (with 
first  aorist  vowel  a  instead  of  e  as  often  in  the  Koini)  of 


86        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

anaireOy  common  in  the  N.T.  in  the  sense  of  take  up  and 
make  away  with,  to  kill  as  in  verse  28,  but  here  only  in  the 
N.T.  in  the  original  sense  of  taking  up  from  the  ground  and 
with  the  middle  voice  (for  oneself).  Quoted  here  from  Ex. 
2:5.  The  word  was  used  of  old  for  picking  up  exposed  chil- 
dren as  here.  Vincent  quotes  Aristophanes  {Clouds^  530 • 
"I  exposed  (the  child),  and  some  other  women,  having  taken 
it,  adopted  {aneileto)  it."  Vulgate  has  sustulit.  "Adopted" 
is  the  idea  here.  "After  the  birth  of  a  child  the  father 
took  it  up  to  his  bosom,  if  he  meant  to  rear  it;  otherwise 
it  was  doomed  to  perish"  (Hackett).  Nourished  him  for  her 
own  son  {anethrepsato  anion  heautei  eis  huion).  Literally, 
"she  nursed  him  up  for  herself  {heautei  besides  middle 
voice)  as  a  son."  This  use  of  eis  =  as  occurs  in  the  old  Greek, 
but  is  very  common  in  the  LXX  as  a  translation  of  the 
Hebrew  le.  The  tradition  is  that  she  designed  Moses  for 
the   throne  as   the   Pharaoh   had  no  son   (Josephus,  Ant, 

22.  Was  instructed  (epaideuthe).  First  aorist  passive  in- 
dicative of  paideud,  to  train  a  child  {pais),  the  usual  idea  in 
ancient  Greek  as  here.  The  notion  of  chastisement  (Heb. 
12:6)  is  also  in  the  old  Greek  and  especially  in  the  LXX  and 
the  N.T.  Here  with  instrumental  case  {pasei  sophidi)  or  the 
locative.  The  accusative  would  usually  be  retained  after 
this  verb.  The  priestly  caste  in  Egypt  was  noted  for  their 
knowledge  of  science,  astronomy,  medicine,  and  mathe- 
matics. This  reputation  was  proverbial  (I  Kings  4:30). 
Modern  discoveries  have  thrown  much  light  on  the  ancient 
civilization  of  Egypt.  Moses,  like  Paul,  was  a  man  of  the 
schools.  Mighty  in  his  words  and  works  {dun  at  as  en  logois 
kai  ergois  autou).  The  same  phrase  used  of  Jesus  in  Luke 
24:19.  The  adjective  dunatos  is  employed  of  Apollos  as  an 
interpreter  of  the  Scriptures  (Acts  18:24).  Moses  did  not 
have  the  rhetorical  skill  or  eloquence  of  Aaron  (Ex.  4:10), 
but  his  words  like  his  deeds  carried  weight  and  power. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  87 

23.  When  he  was  well-nigh  forty  years  old  (Hos  eplerouto 
autoi  tessarakontaetes  chronos).  A  rather  awkward  Greek 
idiom  for  the  English:  "When  a  forty  year  old  time  (same 
idiom  in  Acts  13:18  and  only  twice  in  the  N.T.)  was  being 
fulfilled  (eplerouto,  imperfect  passive)  for  him  (dative  case)." 
The  life  of  Moses  is  divided  into  three  periods  of  forty  years 
each  (in  Egypt  40  years,  in  Midian  40,  governed  Israel  40, 
120  when  he  died,  Deut.  34:7).  It  came  into  his  heart  {anebe 
epi  ten  kardian  autou).  Second  aorist  active  indicative  of 
anabaino,  common  verb.  Came  up  as  if  from  the  lower  deeps 
of  his  nature.  This  Hebrew  image  occurs  in  Jer.  3:16;  Isa. 
65:17;  I  Cor.  2:9.  To  visit  [episkepsasthai).  First  aorist 
middle  infinitive  of  episkeptomai,  old  verb  to  go  to  see  for 
oneself,  with  his  own  eyes,  to  help  if  possible.  Used  of  God 
visiting  his  people  (Luke  7:16).  Our  "visit"  is  from  Latin 
video,  to  see,  visito,  to  go  to  see.  During  the  Welsh  mining 
troubles  the  Prince  of  Wales  made  a  sympathetic  visit  to  see 
for  himself  the  actual  condition  of  the  coal  miners.  Moses 
desired  to  know  first  hand  how  his  kinsmen  were  faring. 

24.  Suffer  wrong  (adikoumenon).  Present  passive  partici- 
ple of  adikeo.  By  blows  (Ex.  2:11).  Avenged  (epoiesen 
ekdikesin).  First  aorist  active  indicative  of  poieo.  This 
idiom  occurs  in  Luke  18:7  with  ekdikesin  (this  from  ekdikeo 
and  that  from  ekdikos  without  right  or  law  dike  and  then 
exacting  law  of  right  out  of  ek  one,  exacting  vengeance). 
Him  that  was  oppressed  (toi  kataponoumenoi) .  Present 
passive  articular  participle  in  the  dative  case  of  kataponeOy 
to  tire  down  with  toil,  to  treat  roughly,  common  in  late 
Greek,  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  II  Pet.  2:7  (sore  distressed). 
The  man  was  on  the  point  of  being  overcome.  Smiting 
(pataxas).  First  aorist  active  participle  of  patasso,  in  the 
old  Greek  the  beat  of  the  heart,  only  in  the  LXX  and  N.T. 
to  smite  a  deadly  blow  as  here  like  plesso. 

25.  He  supposed  (enomizen).  Imperfect  active  of  nomizo. 
He  was  supposing,  Stephen  explains,  when  he  smote  the 


88        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Egyptian.  That  his  brethren  understood  {sunienai  tous 
adelphous).  Present  active  infinitive  of  suniemi,  to  send 
(put)  together,  to  grasp,  to  comprehend,  in  indirect  dis- 
course with  the  accusative  of  general  reference.  By  his  hand 
was  giving  them  deliverance  {dia  cheiros  autou  didosin  sote- 
rian  autois).  Picturesque  use  of  "hand"  as  in  2:23,  present 
active  indicative  of  didomi  retained  in  indirect  discourse 
after  imperfect  enomizen.  But  they  understood  not  [hoi  de  ou 
sunekan).  Page  notes  "the  rhetorical  power  of  these  words" 
from  Stephen.  Sunekan  (first  aorist  indicative,  k  aorist) 
refers  to  sunienai  just  before. 

26.  The  day  following  (tei  epiousei  hemerdi).  Locative 
case,  "on  the  following  day"  (from  epeimi,  to  come  upon, 
to  approach,  present  active  participle  epion  -ousa,  -on). 
Common  phrase  in  old  Greek  both  with  hemera  (day)  as 
here  and  without  as  16:11.  Only  in  Acts  in  the  N.T.  Ap- 
peared (ophthe).  First  aorist  passive  indicative  of  horao 
not  with  idea  that  only  a  vision  but  rather  that  it  was  sud- 
den or  unexpected.  As  they  strove  {machomenois).  Present 
middle  participle  of  machomai,  actually  fighting.  Would 
have  set  them  at  one  again  (sunellassen  autous  eis  eirenen). 
Better,  he  tried  to  reconcile  them  (or  change  them  into 
peace).  It  is  the  conative  imperfect  active  as  in  Matt.  3:14 
of  sunallasso,  only  here  in  the  N.T.  though  common  in  the 
old  Greek.  Vulgate  has  reconciliabat.  The  usual  word  in  the 
N.T.  for  reconcile  is  katallasso.  Do  ye  wrong  one  to  another 
{adikeite  allelous).  The  same  word  used  in  verse  24  of  the 
wrong  done  one  of  the  Hebrews  by  the  Egyptian,  but  here 
both  are  "brethren." 

27.  Thrust  him  away  {aposato  auton).  First  aorist  middle 
indicative  {Koine  for  Attic  apebsato)  of  apdtheo,  to  push  away 
from  oneself  in  middle  voice  as  here,  common  in  old  Greek. 
Again  in  verse  39;  13:46;  Rom.  ii:i;  I  Tim.  1:19.  It  is 
always  the  man  who  is  doing  the  wrong  who  is  hard  to  recon- 
cile. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  89 

28.  Wouldest  thou  kill  me?  {me  anelein  w£  su  theleis). 
Expecting  the  answer  no,  but  a  thrust  direct  at  Moses,  Do 
you  wish  to  kill  me  (note  me  su  right  together,  me  thou). 
See  Ex.  2:14  quoted  by  Stephen. 

29.  Sojourner  (paroikos).  Temporary  dweller  (cf.  Abra- 
ham in  verse  6)  in  Midian  though  for  forty  years. 

30.  Sentence  begins  with  genitive  absolute  again.  In  a 
flame  of  fire  in  a  bush  {en  phlogi  puros  baiou),  Horeb  in  Ex. 
3:1;  but  Sinai  and  Horeb  were  "probably  peaks  of  one 
mountain  range"  (Page),  Horeb  "the  mountain  of  the 
dried-up  ground,"  Sinai  "the  mountain  of  the  thorns." 
Literally,  "in  the  flame  of  fire  of  a  bush"  (two  genitives, 
puros  and  baiou  dependent  on  phlogi^  flame).  Descriptive 
genitives  as  in  9:15;  H  Thess.  1:8.  Batos  (bush)  is  the  wild 
acacia  {mimosa  nilotica).  In  Ex.  3:20  it  is  Jehovah  who 
speaks.  Hence  "angel"  here  with  Stephen  is  understood 
to  be  the  Angel  of  the  Presence,  the  Eternal  Logos  of  the 
Father,  the  Angel  of  Jehovah. 

31.  The  sight  {to  horama).  Used  of  visions  in  the  N.T. 
as  in  Matt.  17:9.  As  he  drew  near  {proserchomenou  autou). 
Genitive  absolute  with  present  middle  participle  of  proser- 
chomai.  A  voice  oj  the  Lord  {phone  kuriou).  Here  the  angel 
of  Jehovah  of  verse  30  is  termed  Jehovah  himself.  Jesus 
makes  powerful  use  of  these  words  in  his  reply  to  the  Sad- 
ducees  in  defence  of  the  doctrine  of  the  resurrection  and 
the  future  life  (Mark  12:26,  Matt.  22:32;  Luke  20:37f.)  that 
God  here  describes  himself  as  the  God  of  the  living.  Trem- 
bled {entromos  genomenos).  Literally,  becoming  tremulous 
or  terrified.  The  adjective  entromos  {en,  tromos  from  tremOj 
to  tremble,  to  quake)  occurs  in  Plutarch  and  the  LXX.  In 
the  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  16:29.  Durst  not  {ouk  etolma). 
Imperfect  active,  was  not  daring,  negative  conative  imperfect. 

33.  Holy  ground  {ge  hagia).  The  priests  were  barefooted 
when  they  ministered  in  the  temple.  Moslems  enter  their 
mosques  barefooted  today.     Cf.  Josh.  5:15.     Sandal  {hup- 


90        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

odema,  bound  under)  is  here  "a  distributive  singular"  (Hack- 
ett).  Even  the  ground  near  the  bush  was  "holy,"  a  fine 
example  for  Stephen's  argument. 

34.  /  have  surely  seen  (idon  eidon).  Imitation  of  the 
Hebrew  infinitive  absolute,  (Ex.  3:7)  "Seeing  I  saw"  (cf. 
Heb.  6:14).  The  affliction  {ten  kakosin).  From  kakody  to 
treat  evilly  (from  kakos,  evil).  Old  word,  here  only  in  the 
N.T.  and  from  Ex.  3:7.  Groaning  (stenagmou) .  Old  word 
from  stenazo,  to  sigh,  to  groan.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and 
Rom.  8:26.  Root  sten  in  our  word  stentorian.  I  am  come 
down  {kateben).  Second  aorist  active  indicative  of  katabainOy 
I  came  down.  To  deliver  (exelesthai) .  Second  aorist  middle 
infinitive  of  exaireo,  to  take  out  for  myself.  /  will  send 
{aposteilo).  First  aorist  active  subjunctive  (hortatory  of 
apostello,  "Let  me  send"). 

35.  This  Moses  {Touton  ton  M  bus  en).  Rhetorical  repeti- 
tion follows  this  description  of  Moses  (five  times,  anaphora, 
besides  the  use  here,  six  cases  of  houtos  here  about  Moses: 
verse  35  twice,  36,  37,  38,  40).  Clearly  Stephen  means  to 
draw  a  parallel  between  Moses  and  Jesus.  They  in  Egypt 
denied  (ernesanto)  Moses  as  now  you  the  Jews  denied  (erne- 
sasthe,  3:13)  Jesus.  Those  in  Egypt  scouted  Moses  as  "ruler 
and  judge"  (verses  27  and  35,  archonta  kai  dikasten)  and 
God  "hath  sent"  {apestalken,  perfect  active  indicative,  state 
of  completion)  Moses  "both  a  ruler  and  a  deliverer"  {ar- 
chonta kai  lutroten)  as  Jesus  was  to  be  (Luke  1:68;  2:38; 
Heb.  9:12;  Tit.  2:14).  "Ransomer"  or  "Redeemer"  {lu- 
trotes)  is  not  found  elsewhere,  lutron  (ransom),  lutroOy  to  ran- 
som, and  lutrosis,  ransoming  or  redemption,  are  found  often. 
In  Acts  5:31  Christ  is  termed  "Prince  and  Saviour."  With 
the  hand  {sun  cheiri) .  So  the  correct  text.  The  Pharisees  had 
accused  Stephen  of  blaspheming  "against  Moses  and  God" 
(6:11).  Stephen  here  answers  that  slander  by  showing  how 
Moses  led  the  people  out  of  Egypt  in  co-operation  {sun)  with 
the  hand  of  the  Angel  of  Jehovah. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  91 

37.  Like  unto  me  (hos  erne).  This  same  passage  Peter 
quoted  to  the  crowd  in  Solomon's  Porch  (Acts  3 122).  Stephen 
undoubtedly  means  to  argue  that  Moses  was  predicting  the 
Messiah  as  a  prophet  like  himself  who  is  no  other  than 
Jesus  so  that  these  Pharisees  are  in  reality  opposing  Moses. 
It  was  a  nea,t  turn. 

38.  In  the  church  in  the  wilderness  {en  tei  ekklesidi  en  tei 
eremoi).  Better  rendered  "congregation"  here  as  in  Heb.  2: 
12  (Psa.  22:22),  the  people  of  Israel  gathered  at  Mt.  Sinai, 
the  whole  nation.  Moses  is  here  represented  as  receiving  the 
law  from  an  angel  as  in  Heb.  2:2;  Gal.  3:19  (Deut.  33:2,  LXX) 
and  so  was  a  mediator  (mesites)  or  middle  man  between  the 
angel  and  the  people  whereas  Jesus  is  the  Mediator  of  a 
better  covenant  (Heb.  8:6).  But  Exodus  does  not  speak  of 
an  angel.  Living  oracles  {logia  zonta).  A  logion  is  a  little 
word  (diminutive  of  logos).  Common  in  the  old  Greek,  LXX, 
Philo,  in  ecclesiastical  writers  for  sayings  of  Christ,  Papias 
(for  instance)  saying  that  Matthew  wrote  in  Hebrew  (Ara- 
maic) "Logia  of  Jesus."  Oxyrhynchus  papyri  fragments 
called  "  Logia  of  Jesus "  are  of  much  interest  though  only 
fragments.  The  Greeks  used  it  of  the  "oracles"  or  brief 
sayings  from  Delphi.  In  the  N.T.  the  word  occurs  only  four 
times  (Acts  7:38;  Rom.  3:2;  Heb.  5:12;  I  Pet.  4:11).  Here 
the  participle  zonta,  living,  is  the  same  used  by  Peter  (I  Pe- 
ter 2:4f.),  stone  (lithos)  of  Christ  and  Christians.  The  words 
from  God  to  Moses  are  still  "living"  today.  In  I  Peter  4:11 
the  word  is  applied  to  one  who  speaks  logia  theou  (oracles  of 
God).  In  Rom.  3:2  Paul  refers  to  the  substance  of  the  law 
and  of  prophecy.  In  Heb.  5:12  the  writer  means  the  sub- 
stance of  the  Christian  religious  teaching. 

39.  To  whom  {hoi).  That  is  Moses,  this  Moses.  Would  not 
be  {ouk  ethelesan  genesthai).  Aorist  active,  negative  aorist, 
were  unwilling  to  become  {genesthai)  obedient.  Thrust  him 
from  them  {aposanto).  Indirect  middle  of  the  very  verb 
used  of  the  man  (verse  27)  who  "thrust"  Moses  away  from 


92        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

him.  Turned  back  {estraphesan).  Second  aorist  passive  in- 
dicative of  strepho,  to  turn.  They  yearned  after  the  fleshpots 
of  Egypt  and  even  the  gods  of  Egypt.  It  is  easy  now  to  see 
why  Stephen  has  patiently  led  his  hearers  through  this 
story.    He  is  getting  ready  for  the  home-thrust. 

40.  Gods  which  shall  go  before  us  (theous  hoi  proporeusontai 
hembn).  Ex.  32:1.  As  guides  and  protectors,  perhaps  with 
some  allusion  to  the  pillar  of  fire  and  of  cloud  that  had  gone 
before  them  (Ex.  13:21).  The  future  indicative  here  with 
hoi  (relative)  expresses  purpose.  We  wot  not  {ouk  oidamen). 
We  do  not  know.  How  quickly  they  had  forgotten  both 
God  and  Moses  while  Moses  was  absent  in  the  mount  with 
God.  Become  of  him  {egeneto  autoi).  Happened  to  him. 
"This"  (houtos)  here  is  a  contemptuous  allusion  to  Moses 
by  the  people. 

41.  They  made  a  calf  (emoschopoiesan).  First  aorist  active 
indicative  of  moschopoieo,  here  only  in  the  N.T.  and  unknown 
elsewhere.  The  LXX  (Ex.  32:3)  has  epoiese  moschon  from 
which  phrase  the  word  is  evidently  made.  Aaron  made  the 
calf,  but  so  did  the  people  (Ex.  32:35).  The  idol  {toi  eidoloi). 
Stephen  calls  it  by  the  right  name.  The  people  said  it  was 
their  way  of  worshipping  Jehovah!  So  the  Egyptians  wor- 
shipped the  bull  Apis  at  Memphis  as  the  symbol  of  Osiris 
(the  sun).  They  had  another  sacred  bull  Mnevis  at  Leontop- 
olis.  Eidolon  (from  eidos,  form  or  figure)  is  the  image  or 
likeness  of  anything.  The  heathen  worship  the  god  through 
the  image  or  idol.  Rejoiced  (euphrainonto) .  Imperfect, 
middle,  kept  on  rejoicing  (Ex.  32:6,  18)  or  making  merry. 

42.  Gave  thefn  up  (paredoken).  First  aorist  active  indica- 
tive of  paradidomi.  This  same  form  occurs  three  times  like 
clods  on  a  coffin  in  a  grave  in  Rom.  i  :24,  26,  28  where  Paul 
speaks  of  God  giving  the  heathen  up  to  their  lusts.  To  serve 
the  host  oj  heaven  (latreuein  tei  stratidi  tou  ouranou).  The 
verb  latreub  is  used  of  the  worship  of  God  (Matt.  4:10)  as' 
well  as  of  idols  as  here  (from  latron,  hire,  latris,  hireling,  then 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  93 

to  serve).  But  the  worship  of  the  host  of  heaven  (Deut.  17:3; 
II Kings  17:16; 21 :3;  II  Chron.33:3,  5;  Jer.  8:2;  19:13)  is  Sab- 
aism  or  worship  of  the  host  {stratia)  of  heaven  (sun,  moon,  and 
stars)  instead  of  the  Lord  of  hosts.  This  star-worship  greatly- 
injured  the  Jews.  In  the  book  of  the  prophets  {en  bibloi  ton 
propheton).  That  is  the  twelve  minor  prophets  which  the 
Jews  counted  as  one  book  (cf.  Acts  13:40),  This  quotation 
is  from  Amos  5:25-27.  The  greater  prophets  were  Isaiah, 
Jeremiah,  Ezekiel.  Slain  beasts  {sphagia).  Here  only  in  the 
N.T.  (from  Amos  5:25)  sphage,  slaughter,  sphazo,  to  day. 

43.  The  tabernacle  of  Moloch  {ten  skenen  tou  Moloch).  Or 
tent  of  Moloch  which  they  took  up  after  each  halt  instead  of 
the  tabernacle  of  Jehovah.  Moloch  was  the  god  of  the  Amor- 
ites  to  whom  children  were  offered  as  live  sacrifices,  an  ox- 
headed  image  with  arms  outstretched  in  which  children  were 
placed  and  hollow  underneath  so  that  fire  could  burn  under- 
neath. The  star  of  the  god  Rephan  {to  astron  tou  theou  Rom- 
pha).  Spelled  also  Romphan  and  Remphan.  Supposed  to  be 
Coptic  for  the  star  Saturn  to  which  the  Egyptians,  Arabs, 
and  Phoenicians  gave  worship.  But  some  scholars  take  the 
Hebrew  Kiyyoon  to  mean  statues  and  not  a  proper  name  at 
all,  "statues  of  your  gods"  carried  in  procession,  making 
"figures"  {tupous)  with  both  "tabernacle"  and  "star"  which 
they  carried  in  procession.  /  will  carry  {metoikio).  Attic 
future  of  metoikiso  from  metoikizb.  Beyond  Babylon  {epekeina 
Babulonos).  The  Hebrew  and  the  LXX  have  "beyond  Da- 
mascus." An  adverbial  preposition  {ep'  ekeina  with  mere 
understood)  used  in  the  old  Greek  and  the  LXX  with  the 
ablative  case  and  meaning  "beyond."  Here  only  in  the 
N.T.  in  quotation  from  Amos.  5:27. 

44.  The  tabernacle  of  the  testimony  {he  skene  tou  martu- 
riou).  Probably  suggested  by  the  mention  of  "the  taber- 
nacle of  Moloch"  (verse  43).  See  on  Matt.  17:4  for  dis- 
cussion of  skene  (from  skia,  shadow,  root  ska,  to  cover). 
This  first  sanctuary  was  not  the  temple,  but  the  tent  in  the

wilderness.  "Stephen  passes  on  from  the  conduct  of  the 
Israelites  to  his  other  argument  that  God  is  not  necessarily- 
worshipped  in  a  particular  spot"  (Page).  According  to  the 
figure  {kata  ton  tupon).  According  to  the  type  or  pattern. 
Tupos  is  from  tupto,  to  strike,  to  smite,  and  is  the  print  of 
the  blow  (John  20:25),  then  the  figure  formed  by  a  blow  or 
impression  like  our  type,  a  model  or  example.  Quoted  from 
Ex.  25:40.  Common  word  in  the  old  Greek.  That  he  had 
seen  {hon  hedrakei).  Past  perfect  active  of  horao,  to  see 
(double  reduplication). 

45.  Which  (hen).  Agreeing  with  skenen,  not  with  tupon. 
In  their  turn  {diadexamenoi).  First  aorist  middle  participle 
of  diadechomai,  to  receive  through  another,  to  receive  in 
sucession  or  in  turn.  Late  Greek,  only  here  in  N.T.  Deiss- 
mann  {Bible  Studies,  p.  115)  argues  from  a  second  century 
B.C.  papyrus  that  diadochos  means  rather  deputy  or  court 
official  than  successor.  With  Joshua  {meta  lesou).  With 
Jesus,  the  Greek  form  of  Joshua  (contracted  from  Jehoshua, 
Matt.  1:21),  as  in  Heb.  4:8.  When  they  entered  on  the  pos- 
session of  the  nations  {en  tei  kataschesei  ton  ethnon).  Lit- 
erally "in  (or  at  the  time  of)  the  possession  of  the  nations." 
See  on  7:5  for  the  only  other  N.T.  instance  of  kataschesis. 
Which  {hon).  The  nations,  genitive  by  attraction  to  case  of 
ethnon.  Thrust  out  {exosen).  First  aorist  active  indicative  of 
exothed,  to  push  out,  common  verb,  here,  only  in  N.T.  save 
some  MSS.  in  Acts  27:39. 

46.  Asked  {eitesato).  Aorist  middle  (indirect)  indicative, 
asked  for  himself  (as  a  favour  to  himself).  Cf.  II  Sam.  7:2f. 
A  habitation  {skenbma).  Like  Psa.  132:5,  but  it  was  a  house 
that  David  proposed  to  build  (II  Sam.  7:2),  not  a  tent 
(skene)  which  already  existed.  Skenoma  here  means  a  more 
permanent  abode  {oikon,  house,  in  verse  47),  though  from 
the  same  root  as  skene. 

48.  Howbeit  {all').  By  contrast  with  what  Solomon  did 
and   David   planned.      Note  emphatic   position  of  "not" 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  95 

(aW  ouch),  "But  not  does  the  Most  High  dwell."  The 
presence  of  the  Most  High  is  not  confined  in  any  building, 
even  one  so  splendid  as  Solomon's  Temple  as  Solomon  him- 
self foresaw  and  acknowledged  in  his  prayer  (I  Kings  8:27; 
n  Chron.  6:18).  In  houses  made  with  hands  {en  cheiropoie- 
tois).  No  word  here  for  "houses"  or  "temples"  in  correct 
text  {naois  temples  in  Textus  'Receptus).  Literally,  "In 
things  made  with  hands"  (cheir,  hand,  poietos,  verbal  adjec- 
tive of  poieo).  It  occurs  in  Mark  14:58  of  the  temple  and 
of  the  sanctuary  of  Moab  (Isa.  16:12).  It  occurs  also  in  Acts 
17:24;  Heb.  9:11,  24;  Eph.  2:11.  Common  in  the  old  Greek. 
The  prophet  {ho  prophet es).  Isa.  66:i.  Isaiah  taught  plainly 
that  heaven  is  God's  throne. 

49.  What  manner  of  house  {Poion  oikon).  What  sort  of  a 
house.''  This  interrogative  is  sometimes  scornful  as  in  4:7 
and  Luke  6:32!^.  (Page).  So  Stephen  shows  by  Isaiah  that 
Solomon  was  right  that  the  temple  was  not  meant  to  "con- 
fine" God's  presence  and  that  Jesus  had  rightly  shown  that 
God  is  a  spirit  and  can  be  worshipped  anywhere  by  any 
individual  of  any  race  or  land.  It  is  a  tremendous  argument 
for  the  universality  and  spirituality  of  Christianity  free 
from  the  shackles  of  Jewish  racial  and  national  limitations, 
but  its  very  strength  only  angered  the  Sanhedrin  to  des- 
peration. 

51.  Stiffnecked  {sklerotracheloi) .  From  skleros  (hard)  and 
tracheloSy  neck,  both  old  words,  but  this  compound  only  in 
the  LXX  and  here  alone  in  the  N.T.  Critics  assume  that 
Stephen  was  interrupted  at  this  point  because  of  the  sharp 
tone  of  the  speech.  That  may  be  true,  but  the  natural 
climax  is  sufficient  explanation.  Uncircumcised  in  heart 
{aperitmetoi  kardiais).  Late  adjective  common  in  LXX  and 
here  only  in  the  N.T.  Verbal  of  peritemnOj  to  cut  around 
and  a  privative.  Both  of  these  epithets  are  applied  to  the 
Jews  in  the  O.T.  (Ex.  32:9;  33:3,  5;  34:9;  Lev.  26:41;  Deut. 
9:6;  Jer.  6:10).    Kardiais  Is  locative  plural  like  osin  (ears), 


96        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

but  some  MSS.  have  genitive  singular  kardias  (objective 
genitive).  No  epithet  could  have  been  more  galling  to  these 
Pharisees  than  to  be  turned  "uncircumcised  in  heart" 
(Rom.  2:29).  They  had  only  the  physical  circumcision  which 
was  useless.  Ye  always  {humeis  aei).  Emphatic  position  of 
humeis  and  "always"  looks  backward  over  the  history  of 
their  forefathers  which  Stephen  had  reviewed.  Resist  (anti- 
piptete).  Old  word  to  fall  against,  to  rush  against.  Only  here 
in  the  N.T.,  but  used  in  the  O.T.  which  is  here  quoted 
(Numb.  27:14).  Their  fathers  had  made  "external  worship 
a  substitute  for  spiritual  obedience"  (Furneaux).  Stephen 
has  shown  how  God  had  revealed  himself  gradually,  the 
revelation  sloping  upward  to  Christ  Jesus.  "And  as  he  saw 
his  countrymen  repeating  the  old  mistake — clinging  to  the 
present  and  the  material,  while  God  was  calling  them  to 
higher  spiritual  levels — and  still,  as  ever,  resisting  the  Holy 
Spirit,  treating  the  Messiah  as  the  patriarchs  had  treated 
Joseph,  and  the  Hebrews  Moses — the  pity  of  it  overwhelmed 
him,  and  his  mingled  grief  and  indignation  broke  out  in  words 
of  fire,  such  as  burned  of  old  on  the  lips  of  the  prophets" 
(Furneaux).  Stephen,  the  accused,  is  now  the  accuser,  and 
the  situation  becomes  intolerable  to  the  Sanhedrin. 

52.  Which  of  the  prophets  {tina  ton  propheton).  Jesus 
(Luke  11:47  and  Matt.  23:29-37)  had  charged  them  with 
this  very  thing.  Cf.  II  Chron.  36:16.  Which  shewed  before 
{prokataggeilantas) .  The  very  prophets  who  foretold  the 
coming  of  the  Messiah  their  fathers  killed.  The  coming 
{tes  eleuseos).  Not  in  ancient  Greek  or  LXX  and  only  here 
in  the  N.T.  (in  a  few  late  writers).  Betrayers  (prodotai). 
Just  like  Judas  Iscariot.  He  hurled  this  old  biting  word  at 
them.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  6:16;  II  Tim.  3:4. 
It  cut  like  a  knife.  It  is  blunter  than  Peter  in  Acts  3:13. 
Murderers  (phoneis).  The  climax  with  this  sharp  word  used 
of  Barabbas  (3:14). 

53.  Ye  who  (hoitines).     The  very  ones  who,  quippe  qui. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  97 

often  in  Acts  when  the  persons  are  enlarged  upon  (8:15; 
9:35;  10:41,  47).  As  it  was  ordained  by  angels  (eis  diatagas 
aggelon).  About  angels  see  on  7:38.  Diatage  (from  diatasso, 
to  arrange,  appoint)  occurs  in  late  Greek,  LXX,  inscriptions, 
papyri,  Deissmann,  Light  from  the  Ancient  East,  pp.  Sgff., 
and  in  N.T.  only  here  and  Rom.  13:2.  At  (or  as)  the  ap- 
pointment of  angels  (cf.  Matt.  10:41;  12:41  for  this  use  of 
eis).  And  kept  it  not  (kai  ouk  ephulaxate).  Like  a  whip- 
cracker  these  words  cut  to  the  quick.  They  gloried  in  pos- 
sessing the  law  and  openly  violated  it  (Rom.  2:23). 

54.  When  they  heard  (akouontes).  Present  active  participle 
of  akouo,  while  hearing.  They  were  cut  to  the  heart  (diepri- 
onto  tais  kardiais).  See  5:33  where  the  same  word  and  form 
(imperfect  passive  of  diaprio)  is  used  of  the  effect  of  Peter's 
speech  on  the  Sadducees.  Here  Stephen  had  sent  a  saw 
through  the  hearts  of  the  Pharisees  that  rasped  them  to  the 
bone.  They  gnashed  on  him  with  their  teeth  (ebruchon  ious 
odontas  ep*  auton).  Imperfect  (inchoative)  active  of  brucho 
(Attic  brukd)y  to  bite  with  loud  noise,  to  grind  or  gnash  the 
teeth.  Literally,  They  began  to  gnash  their  teeth  at  (ep') 
him  (just  like  a  pack  of  hungry,  snarling  wolves).  Stephen 
knew  that  it  meant  death  for  him. 

55.  And  Jesus  standing  {kai  lesoun  hestota).  Full  of  the 
Holy  Spirit,  gazing  steadfastly  into  heaven,  he  saw  God's 
glory  and  Jesus  "standing"  as  if  he  had  risen  to  cheer  the 
brave  Stephen.  Elsewhere  (save  verse  56  also)  he  is  pic- 
tured as  sitting  at  the  right  hand  of  God  (the  Session  of 
Christ)  as  in  Matt.  26:64;  Mark  16:19;  Acts  2:34;  Eph. 
1:20;  CoL  3:1;  Heb.  1:3. 

56.  Opened  (dienoigmenous).  Perfect  passive  predicate 
participle  of  dianoignumi  (cf.  Matt.  3:16  =  Luke  3:21). 
The  son  of  man  {ton  huion  tou  anthropou).  Elsewhere  in  the 
N.T.  in  Christ's  own  words.  Here  Stephen  may  refer  to  the 
words  of  Jesus  as  preserved  in  Matt.  26:64. 

57.  Stopped  their  ears  {suneschon  ta  ota  auton).     Second 


98        WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

aorist  active  of  sunecho,  to  hold  together.  They  held  their 
ears  together  with  their  hands  and  affected  to  believe  Stephen 
guilty  of  blasphemy  (cf.  Matt.  26:65).  Rushed  upon  him 
with  one  accord  {hormesan  homothumadon  ep^  anion).  Ingres- 
sive  aorist  active  indicative  of  hormao,  to  rush  impetuously 
as  the  hogs  did  down  the  cliff  when  the  demons  entered  them 
(Luke  8:33).  No  vote  was  taken  by  the  Sanhedrin.  No 
scruple  was  raised  about  not  having  the  right  to  put  him  to 
death  (John  8:31).  It  may  have  taken  place  after  Pilate's 
recall  and  before  his  successor  came  or  Pilate,  if  there, 
just  connived  at  such  an  incident  that  did  not  concern  Rome. 
At  any  rate  it  was  mob  violence  like  modern  lynching  that 
took  the  law  into  the  hands  of  the  Sanhedrin  without  further 
formalities.  Out  of  the  city  {ek  tes  poleos).  To  keep  from 
defiling  the  place  with  blood.  But  they  sought  to  kill  Paul 
as  soon  as  they  got  him  out  of  the  temple  area  (Acts  21 :3of.). 
Stoned  {eliihoholoun) .  Imperfect  active  indicative  of  litho- 
boleOy  began  to  stone,  from  lithoholos  {lithos,  stone,  balld, 
to  throw),  late  Greek  verb,  several  times  in  the  N.T.  as  Luke 
13:34.  Stoning  was  the  Jewish  punishment  for  blasphemy 
(Lev.  24:14-16).  The  witnesses  {hoi  martures).  The  false 
testifiers  against  Stephen  suborned  by  the  Pharisees  (Acts 
6:11,  13).  These  witnesses  had  the  privilege  of  casting  the 
first  stones  (Deut.  13:10;  177)  against  the  first  witness  for 
Christ  with  death  {martyr  in  our  modern  sense  of  the  word). 
At  the  feet  of  a  young  man  named  Saul  {para  tous  podas 
neaniou  kaloumenou  Saulou).  Beside  (para)  the  feet.  Our 
first  introduction  to  the  man  who  became  the  greatest  of  all 
followers  of  Jesus  Christ.  Evidently  he  was  not  one  of  the 
"witnesses"  against  Stephen,  for  he  was  throwing  no  stones 
at  him.  But  evidently  he  was  already  a  leader  in  the  group 
of  Pharisees.  We  know  from  later  hints  from  Saul  (Paul) 
himself  that  he  had  been  a  pupil  of  Gamaliel  (Acts  22:3). 
Gamaliel,  as  the  Pharisaic  leader  in  the  Sanhedrin,  was  prob- 
ably on  hand  to  hear  the  accusations  against  Stephen  by 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  99 

the  Pharisees.  But,  if  so,  he  does  not  raise  his  voice  against 
this  mob  violence.  Saul  does  not  seem  to  be  aware  that  he  is 
going  contrary  to  the  views  of  his  master,  though  pupils 
often  go  further  than  their  teachers. 

59.  They  stoned  (elithoboloun) .  Same  verb  and  tense  re- 
peated, they  kept  on  stoning,  they  kept  it  up  as  he  was 
calling  upon  the  Lord  Jesus  and  making  direct  prayer  to 
him  as  "Lord  Jesus"  {Kurie  lesou).  Receive  my  spirit  {dexai 
to  pneuma  mou).  Aorist  middle  imperative,  urgency,  re- 
ceive it  now.  Many  have  followed  Stephen  into  death  with 
these  words  upon  their  dying  lips.     Sec.  9:14,  21,  22:16. 

60.  Kneeled  down  {theis  ta  gonata).  Second  aorist  active 
participle  of  tithemi,  placing  the  knees  (on  the  ground). 
This  idiom  is  not  in  the  old  Greek  for  kneeling,  but  Luke  has 
it  five  times  (Luke  22:41;  Acts  7:60;  9:40;  22:36;  21:5) 
and  Mark  once  (15:19).  Jesus  was  standing  at  the  right  hand 
of  God  and  Stephen  knelt  before  him  in  worship  and  called 
on  him  in  prayer.  Lay  not  this  sin  to  their  charge  {me  steseis 
autois  tauten  ten  hamartian).  First  aorist  (ingressive)  active 
subjunctive  with  me,  regular  Greek  idiom.  Place  not  to  them 
or  against  them  (dative  autois)  this  sin.  The  very  spirit  of 
Jesus  towards  his  enemies  as  he  died  upon  the  Cross  (Luke 
23:34).  He  fell  asleep  (ekoimethe).  First  aorist  passive  indic- 
ative of  koimao,  to  put  to  sleep.  Old  verb  and  the  metaphor 
of  sleep  for  death  is  common  in  all  languages,  but  it  is  pe- 
culiarly appropriate  here  as  Jesus  used  it  of  Lazarus.  See 
also  Acts  13:36;  I  Cor.  15:18,  etc.  Our  word  cemetery 
(koimeterion)  is  the  sleeping  place  of  the  dead.  Knowling 
calls  ekoimethe  here  "a  picture  word  of  rest  and  calmness 
which  stands  in  dramatic  contrast  to  the  rage  and  violence 
of  the  scene." 


CHAPTER  VIII 

1.  Was  consenting  {en  suneudokon) .  Periphrastic  imperfect 
oi  suneudokeo,  a  late  double  compound  {sun,  eu,  dokeo)  that 
well  describes  Saul's  pleasure  in  the  death  {anairesis,  taking 
off,  only  here  in  the  N.T.,  though  old  word)  of  Stephen. 
For  the  verb  see  on  Luke  23:32.  Paul  himself  will  later  con- 
fess that  he  felt  so  (Acts  22:20),  coolly  applauding  the  murder 
of  Stephen,  a  heinous  sin  (Rom.  1:32).  It  is  a  gruesome 
picture.  Chapter  VII  should  have  ended  here.  On  that  day 
{en  ekeinei  tei  hemerdi).  On  that  definite  day,  that  same  day 
as  in  2:41.  A  great  persecution  {diogmos  megas).  It  was  at 
first  persecution  from  the  Sadducees,  but  this  attack  on 
Stephen  was  from  the  Pharisees  so  that  both  parties  are 
now  united  in  a  general  persecution  that  deserves  the  ad- 
jective "great."  See  on  Matt.  13:21  for  the  old  word  diog- 
mos from  dioko,  to  chase,  hunt,  pursue,  persecute.  Were  all 
scattered  abroad  {pantes  die  spares  an).  Second  aorist  passive 
indicative  of  diaspeiro,  to  scatter  like  grain,  to  disperse,  old 
word,  in  the  N.T.  only  in  Acts  8:1,  4;  11:19.  Except  the 
apostles  {plen  ton  apostolon).  Preposition  plen  (adverb  from 
pleon,  more)  with  the  ablative  often  in  Luke.  It  remains  a 
bit  of  a  puzzle  why  the  Pharisees  spared  the  apostles.  Was 
it  due  to  the  advice  of  Gamaliel  in  Acts  5:34-40?  Or  was  it 
the  courage  of  the  apostles.'*  Or  was  it  a  combination  of 
both  with  the  popularity  of  the  apostles  in  addition."* 

2.  Devout  {eulaheis).  Only  four  times  in  the  N.T.  (Luke 
2:25;  Acts  2:5;  8:2;  22:12).  Possibly  some  non-Christian 
Jews  helped.  The  burial  took  place  before  the  Christians 
were  chiefly  scattered.  Buried  {sunekomisan).  Aorist  active 
indicative  of  sunkomizo,  old  verb  to  bring  together,  to  col- 
lect, to  join  with  others  in  carrying,  to  bury   (the  whole 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  lOI 

funeral  arrangements).  Only  here  in  the  N.T.  Lamentation 
(kopeton).  Late  word  from  koptomai,  to  beat  the  breast,  in 
LXX,  Plutarch,  etc.,  only  here  in  the  N.T. 

3.  Laid  waste  {elumaineto) .  Imperfect  middle  of  lumai- 
nomai,  old  verb  (from  lume^  injury),  to  dishonour,  defile, 
devastate,  ruin.  Only  here  in  the  N.T.  Like  the  laying  waste 
of  a  vineyard  by  a  wild  boar  (Psa.  79:13).  Picturesque  de- 
scription of  the  havoc  carried  on  by  Saul  now  the  leader  in  the 
persecution.  He  is  victor  over  Stephen  now  who  had  probably 
worsted  him  in  debate  in  the  Cilician  synagogue  in  Jeru- 
salem. Into  every  house  (kata  tons  oikous).  But  Luke  terms 
it  "the  church"  {ten  ekklesian).  Plainly  not  just  an  "as- 
sembly," but  an  organized  body  that  was  still  "the  church" 
when  scattered  in  their  own  homes,  "an  unassembled  as- 
sembly" according  to  the  etymology.  Words  do  not  remain 
by  the  etymology,  but  travel  on  with  usage.  Haling  (suron). 
Literally,  dragging  forcibly  (  =  hauling).  Present  active 
participle  of  surd,  old  verb.  Men  and  women  {andras  kai 
gunaikas).  A  new  feature  of  the  persecution  that  includes  the 
women.  They  met  it  bravely  as  through  all  the  ages  since 
(cf.  9:2;  22:4).  This  fact  will  be  a  bitter  memory  for  Paul 
always.  Committed  (paredidou) .  Imperfect  active  of  para- 
didomi,  old  verb,  kept  on  handing  them  over  to  prison. 

4.  They  therefore  (hoi  men  oun).  Demonstrative  hoi  as 
often  (i  :6,  etc.)  though  it  will  make  sense  as  the  article  with 
the  participle  diasparentes.  The  general  statement  is  made 
here  by  men  and  a  particular  instance  {de)  follows  in  verse  5. 
The  inferential  particle  {oun)  points  back  to  verse  3,  the 
persecution  by  young  Saul  and  the  Pharisees.  Jesus  had 
commanded  the  disciples  not  to  depart  from  Jerusalem  till 
they  received  the  Promise  of  the  Father  (i  4),  but  they  had 
remained  long  after  that  and  were  not  carrying  the  gospel 
to  the  other  peoples  (1:8).  Now  they  were  pushed  out  by 
Saul  and  began  as  a  result  to  carry  out  the  Great  Commis- 
sion for  world  conquest,  that  is  those  "scattered  abroad" 


102      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

(diasparentes,  second  aorist  passive  participle  of  diaspeiro). 
This  verb  means  disperse,  to  sow  in  separate  or  scattered 
places  (dia)  and  so  to  drive  people  hither  and  thither.  Old 
and  very  common  verb,  especially  in  the  LXX,  but  in  the 
N.T.  only  in  Acts  8:i,  4;  11:19.  f^^nt  about  {dielthon). 
Constative  second  aorist  active  of  dierchomai,  to  go  through 
(from  place  to  place,  dia).  Old  and  common  verb,  frequent 
for  missionary  journeys  in  the  Acts  (5:40;  8:40;  9:32;  11:19; 
13 :6).  Preaching  the  word  {euaggelizomenoi  ton  logon).  Evan- 
gelizing or  gospelizing  the  word  (the  truth  about  Christ). 
In  11:19  Luke  explains  more  fully  the  extent  of  the  labours 
of  these  new  preachers  of  the  gospel.  They  were  emergency 
preachers,  not  ordained  clergymen,  but  men  stirred  to  ac- 
tivity by  the  zeal  of  Saul  against  them.  The  blood  of  the 
martyrs  (Stephen)  was  already  becoming  the  seed  of  the 
church.  "The  violent  dispersion  of  these  earnest  disciples 
resulted  in  a  rapid  diffusion  of  the  gospel"  (Alvah  Hovey). 

5.  Philip  (Philippos).  The  deacon  (6:5)  and  evangelist 
(21:8),  not  the  apostle  of  the  same  name  (Mark  3:18). 
To  the  city  of  Samaria  (eis  ten  polin  tes  Samarias).  Genitive 
of  apposition.  Samaria  is  the  name  of  the  city  here.  This  is 
the  first  instance  cited  of  the  expansion  noted  in  verse  4. 
Jesus  had  an  early  and  fruitful  ministry  in  Samaria  (John  4), 
though  the  twelve  were  forbidden  to  go  into  a  Samaritan 
city  during  the  third  tour  of  Galilee  (Matt.  10:5),  a  tem- 
porary prohibition  withdrawn  before  Jesus  ascended  on  high 
(Acts  1:8).  Proclaimed  (ekerussen).  Imperfect  active,  began 
to  preach  and  kept  on  at  It.  Note  euaggelizomenoi  in  verse  4 
of  missionaries  of  good  news  (Page)  while  ekerussen  here 
presents  the  preacher  as  a  herald.  He  is  also  a  teacher 
{didaskalos)  like  Jesus.  Luke  probably  obtained  valuable 
information  from  Philip  and  his  daughters  about  these  early 
days  when  in  his  home  in  Caesarea  (Acts  21:8). 

6.  Gave  heed  (proseichon) .  Imperfect  active  as  in  verses 
10  and  II,  there  with  dative  of  the  person  (autoi),  here  with 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  103 

the  dative  of  the  thing  (tois  legomenois).  There  is  an  ellipse 
of  noun  {mind).  They  kept  on  giving  heed  or  holding  the 
mind  on  the  things  said  by  Philip,  spell-bound,  in  a  word. 
When  they  heard  {en  toi  akouein  autous).  Favourite  Lukan 
idiom,  en  and  the  locative  case  of  the  articlar  infinitive  with 
the  accusative  of  general  reference  "in  the  hearing  as  to 
them."  Which  he  did  {ha  epoiei).  Imperfect  active  again, 
which  he  kept  on  doing  from  time  to  time.  Philip  wrought 
real  miracles  which  upset  the  schemes  of  Simon  Magus. 

7.  For  many  {polloi  gar).  So  the  correct  text  of  the  best 
MSS.,  but  there  is  an  anacoluthon  as  this  nominative  has  no 
verb  with  it.  It  was  "the  unclean  spirits"  that  "came  out" 
{exerchonto,  imperfect  middle).  The  margin  of  the  Revised 
Version  has  it  "came  forth,"  as  if  they  came  out  of  a  house, 
a  rather  strained  translation.  The  loud  outcry  is  like  the 
demons  cast  out  by  Jesus  (Mark  3:11;  Luke  4:41).  Palsied 
{paralelumenoi,  perfect  passive  participle).  Luke's  usual 
word,  loosened  at  the  side,  with  no  power  over  the  muscles. 
Furneaux  notes  that  "the  servant  was  reaping  where  the 
Master  had  sown.  Samaria  was  the  mission  field  white  for 
the  harvest  (John  4:35)."  The  Samaritans  who  had  been 
bewitched  by  Simon  are  now  carried  away  by  Philip. 

9.  Simon  {Simon).  One  of  the  common  names  (Josephus, 
Ant.  XX.  7,  2)  and  a  number  of  messianic  pretenders  had 
this  name.  A  large  number  of  traditions  in  the  second  and 
third  centuries  gathered  round  this  man  and  Baur  actually 
proposed  that  the  Simon  of  the  Clementine  Homilies  is 
really  the  apostle  Paul  though  Paul  triumphed  over  the 
powers  of  magic  repeatedly  (Acts  13:6-12;  19:11-19),  "a 
perfect  absurdity"  (Spitta,  Jpostelgeschichte,  p.  149).  One 
of  the  legends  is  that  this  Simon  Magus  of  Acts  is  the  father 
of  heresy  and  went  to  Rome  and  was  worshipped  as  a  god  (so 
Justin  Martyr).  But  a  stone  found  in  the  Tiber  a.d.  1574 
has  an  inscription  to  Semoni  Sanco  Deo  Fidio  Sacrum  which 
is  (Page)  clearly  to  Hercules,  Sancus  being  a  Sabine  name 


104      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

for  Hercules.  This  Simon  in  Samaria  is  simply  one  of  the 
many  magicians  of  the  time  before  the  later  gnosticism  had 
gained  a  foothold,  "In  his  person  Christianity  was  for  the 
first  time  confronted  with  superstition  and  religious  impos- 
ture, of  which  the  ancient  world  was  at  this  period  full" 
(Furneaux).  Which  beforetime  used  sorcery  {proiiperchen 
mageuon).  An  ancient  idiom  (periphrastic),  the  present 
active  participle  mageuon  with  the  imperfect  active  verb 
from  proiiparcho,  the  idiom  only  here  and  Luke  23:12  in  the 
N.T.  Literally  "Simon  was  existing  previously  practising 
magic."  This  old  verb  mageud  is  from  magos  (a  magus,  seer, 
prophet,  false  prophet,  sorcerer)  and  occurs  here  alone  in  the 
N.T.  Amazed  (existandn).  Present  active  participle  of  the 
verb  existano,  later  form  of  existemi,  to  throw  out  of  position, 
displace,  upset,  astonish,  chiefly  in  the  Gospels  in  the  N.T. 
Same  construction  as  mageuon.  Some  great  one  (tina  megan). 
Predicate  accusative  of  general  reference  (infinitive  in  in- 
direct discourse).  It  is  amazing  how  gullible  people  are  in 
the  presence  of  a  manifest  impostor  like  Simon.  The  Magi 
were  the  priestly  order  in  the  Median  and  Persian  empires 
and  were  supposed  to  have  been  founded  by  Zoroaster.  The 
word  magoi  {magi)  has  a  good  sense  in  Matt.  2:1,  but  here 
and  in  Acts  13:6  it  has  the  bad  sense  like  our  "magic." 

10.  That  power  of  God  which  is  called  Great  {he  Dunamis  tou 
theou  he  kaloumene  Megale).  Apparently  here  already  the 
oriental  doctrine  of  emanations  or  aeons  so  rampant  in  the 
second  century.  This  "power"  was  considered  a  spark  of 
God  himself  and  Jerome  {in  Matt.  c.  24)  quotes  Simon 
(Page)  as  saying:  Ego  sum  sermo  Dei,  .  .  .  ego  omnipotens, 
ego  omnia  Dei.    Simon  claimed  to  impersonate  God. 

1 1 .  Because  that  of  long  time  he  had  amazed  them  with  his 
sorceries  {dia  to  hikanoi  chronoi  tais  magiais  exestakenai 
autous).  Causal  use  of  dia  with  the  accusative  articular 
infinitive  (perfect  active  Koine  form  and  transitive,  exestak- 
enai).   Same  verb  as  in  verse  9  participle  existandn  and  in 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  105 

verse  13  imperfect  passive  existato  (cf.  also  2:7  already). 
Chronoi  is  associative  instrumental  and  magiais  instrumental 
case. 

12.  They  were  baptized  (ebaptizonto) .  Imperfect  passive 
(repetition,  from  time  to  time),  while  believed  (episteusan) 
is  constative  aorist  antecedent  to  the  baptism.  Note  dative 
case  of  Philip  with  episteusan.  Note  the  gospel  of  Philip 
"concerning  the  kingdom  of  God,  and  the  name  of  Jesus 
Christ." 

13.  j4nd  Simon  also  himself  believed  {Ho  de  Simon  kai 
autos  episteusen).  Note  the  same  verb  in  the  aorist  tense 
episteusen.  What  did  he  believe  .'*  Evidently  that  Jesus  was 
this  "power  of  God"  not  himself  (Simon).  He  saw  that  the 
miracles  wrought  by  Philip  in  the  name  of  Christ  were  gen- 
uine while  he  knew  that  his  own  were  frauds.  He  wanted  this 
power  that  Philip  had  to  add  to  his  own  pretensions.  "He 
was  probably  half  victim  of  self-delusion,  half  conscious 
impostor"  (Furneaux).  He  was  determined  to  get  this  new 
"power,"  but  had  no  sense  of  personal  need  of  Jesus  as 
Saviour  for  his  sins.  So  he  submitted  to  baptism  (baptis- 
theis,  first  aorist  passive  participle  of  baptizo),  clear  proof  that 
baptism  does  not  convey  salvation.  He  continued  with  Philip 
{en  proskarteron  tbi  Philippoi).  Periphrastic  imperfect 
of  the  verb  proskartereo  (see  on  2:46).  He  stuck  to  Philip 
(dative  case)  to  find  out  the  secret  of  his  power.  Beholding 
{the  or  on).  Watching  the  signs  and  miracles  (powers,  dun- 
ameis  that  threw  his  "power"  in  the  shade)  as  they  were 
wrought  {ginomenas,  present  middle  participle  of  ginomai). 
The  more  he  watched  the  more  the  wonder  grew  {existato). 
He  had  "amazed"  (verse  9)  the  people  by  his  tricks  and  he 
was  himself  more  "amazed"  than  they  by  Philip's  deeds. 

14.  That  Samaria  had  received  {hoti  dedektai  he  Samaria). 
The  district  here,  not  the  city  as  in  verse  5,  Perfect  middle 
indicative  of  dechomai  retained  in  indirect  discourse.  It  was 
a  major  event  for  the  apostles  for  now  the  gospel  was  going 


I06      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

into  Samaria  as  Jesus  had  predicted  (i:8).  Though  the 
Samaritans  were  nominally  Jews,  they  were  not  held  so  by 
the  people.  The  sending  of  Peter  and  John  was  no  reflec- 
tion on  Philip,  but  was  an  appropriate  mission  since  "many 
Christian  Jews  would  be  scandalized  by  the  admission  of 
Samaritans"  (Furneaux).  If  Peter  and  John  sanctioned  it, 
the  situation  would  be  improved.  John  had  once  wanted  to 
call  down  fire  from  heaven  on  a  Samaritan  village  (Luke 

9:54)- 

15.  That  they  might  receive  {hopos  lahosin).    Second  aorist 

active  subjunctive  of  lambano,  final  clause  with  hopos.  Did 
they  wish  the  Samaritan  Pentecost  to  prove  beyond  a  doubt 
that  the  Samaritans  were  really  converted  when  they  be- 
lieved.^ They  had  been  baptized  on  the  assumption  that 
the  Holy  Spirit  had  given  them  new  hearts.  The  coming 
of  the  Holy  Spirit  with  obvious  signs  (cf.  10:44-48)  as  in 
Jerusalem  would  make  it  plain. 

16.  He  was  fallen  {en  epipeptokos).  Periphrastic  past  per- 
fect active  of  epipipto,  old  verb.  The  participle  is  neuter 
here  because  of  the  grammatical  gender  of  pneuma,  but  the 
translation  should  be  "he"  (natural  gender),  not  "it."  We 
should  not  use  "it"  for  the  Holy  Spirit.  Only  they  had  been 
baptized  (monon  de  babaptismenoi  huperchon) .  Periphrastic 
past  perfect  passive  of  baptizo  with  huparcho  (see  verse  9 
proiiperchon)^  instead  of  esan.  Into  the  name  {eis  to  onoma). 
Better,  in  the  name  (see  on  2:38). 

17.  Laid  they  their  hands  (epetithesan  tas  cheiras).  Im- 
perfect active,  repetition.  The  laying  on  of  hands  did  not 
occur  at  the  great  Pentecost  (2:4,  33)  nor  in  4:31;  10:44  ^^^ 
is  it  mentioned  in  I  Corinthians  12  and  14.  It  is  mentioned 
in  Acts  6:7  about  the  deacons  and  in  13:3  when  Barnabas 
and  Saul  left  Antioch.  And  in  Saul's  case  it  was  Ananias 
who  laid  his  hands  on  him  (9:17).  Hence  it  cannot  be  con- 
cluded that  the  Holy  Spirit  was  received  only  by  the  laying 
on  of  the  hands  of  the  apostles  or  by  the  hands  of  anyone. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  107 

The  so-called  practice  of  "confirmation"  appeals  to  this 
passage,  but  inconclusively.  They  received  (elambanon). 
Imperfect  active,  repetition  as  before  and  pari  passu  with  the 
laying  on  of  the  hands. 

18.  When  Simon  saw  {I don  de  ho  Simon).  This  participle 
(second  aorist  active  of  horao)  shows  plainly  that  those  who 
received  the  gift  of  the  Holy  Spirit  spoke  with  tongues.  Si- 
mon now  saw  power  transferred  to  others.  Hence  he  was 
determined  to  get  this  new  power.  He  offered  them  money 
(prosenegken  chremata).  Second  aorist  active  indicative  of 
prosphero.  He  took  Peter  to  be  like  himself,  a  mountebank 
performer  who  would  sell  his  tricks  for  enough  money. 
Trafficking  in  things  sacred  like  ecclesiastical  preferments 
in  England  is  called  "Simony"  because  of  this  offer  of  Simon. 

19.  Me  also  (kamoi).  This  is  the  whole  point  with  this 
charlatan.  He  wants  the  power  to  pass  on  "this  power." 
His  notion  of  "The  Holy  Spirit"  was  on  this  low  level. 
He  regarded  spiritual  functions  as  a  marketable  commodity. 
Money  "can  buy  diamonds,  but  not  wisdom,  or  sympathy, 
or  faith,  or  holiness"  (Furneaux). 

20.  Perish  with  thee  {sun  soi  eie  eis  apoleian).  Literally, 
Be  with  thee  for  destruction.  Optative  for  a  future  wish. 
The  use  of  eis  with  the  accusative  in  the  predicate  is  espe- 
cially common  in  the  LXX.  The  wish  reveals  Peter's  indigna- 
tion at  the  base  offer  of  Simon.  Peter  was  no  grafter  to 
accept  money  for  spiritual  power.  He  spurned  the  tempta- 
tion. The  natural  meaning  of  Peter's  language  is  that  Simon 
was  on  the  road  to  destruction.  It  is  a  warning  and  almost 
a  curse  on  him,  though  verse  22  shows  that  there  was  still 
room  for  repentance.  To  obtain  {ktdsthai).  To  acquire. 
Usual  meaning  of  the  present  tense  (infinitive  middle)  of 
ktaomai. 

21.  Lot  (kleros).  Same  idea  as  "part"  (meris)j  only  as  a 
figure.  Matter  (logoi).  Literally,  word  or  subject  (as  in 
Luke  1 4;  Acts  15:6),  the  power  of  communicating  the  Holy 


I08      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Spirit.  This  use  of  logos  is  in  the  ancient  Greek.  Straight 
{eutheia).  Quotation  from  Psa.  78:37.  Originally  a  mathe- 
matically straight  line  as  in  Acts  9:11,  then  moral  rectitude 
as  here. 

22.  Wickedness  (kakias).  Only  here  in  Luke's  writings, 
though  old  word  and  in  LXX  (cf.  I  Pet.  2:1,  16).  If  per- 
haps {ei  ara).  Si  forte.  This  idiom,  though  with  the  future 
indicative  and  so  a  condition  of  the  first  class  (determined 
as  fulfilled),  yet  minimizes  the  chance  of  forgiveness  as  in 
Mark  11  :i3.  Peter  may  have  thought  that  his  sin  was  close 
to  the  unpardonable  sin  (Matt.  12:31),  but  he  does  not  close 
the  door  of  hope.  The  thought  (he  epinoia).  Old  Greek  word 
from  epinoeoy  to  think  upon,  and  so  purpose.  Only  here  in 
the  N.T. 

23.  That  thou  art  (se  onta).  Participle  in  indirect  dis- 
course after  horo  (I  see).  In  the  gall  of  bitterness  {eis  cholen 
pikrias).  Old  word  from  cholas  either  from  cheb,  to  pour,  or 
chloe^  yellowish  green,  bile  or  gall.  In  the  N.T.  only  in  Matt. 
27:34  and  here.  In  LXX  in  sense  of  wormwood  as  well  as 
bile.  See  Deut.  29:18;  32:32;  Lam.  3:15;  Job  16:14.  "Gall 
and  bitterness"  in  Deut.  29:18.  Here  the  gall  is  described 
by  the  genitive  pikrias  as  consisting  in  "bitterness."  In 
Heb.  12:15  "a  root  of  bitterness,"  a  bitter  root.  This  word 
pikria  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Heb.  12:15;  Roiri-  3^14; 
Eph.  4:31.  The  "bond  of  iniquity"  (sundesmon  adikias) 
is  from  Isa.  58:6.  Paul  uses  this  word  of  peace  (Eph.  4:3), 
of  love  (Col.  3:14),  of  the  body  (Col.  2:19).  Peter  describes 
Simon's  offer  as  poison  and  a  chain. 

24.  Pray  ye  for  me  (Deethete  humeis  huper  emou).  Empha- 
sis on  humeis  (you).  First  aorist  passive  imperative.  Simon 
is  thoroughly  frightened  by  Peter's  words,  but  shows  no 
sign  of  personal  repentance  or  change  of  heart.  He  wants  to 
escape  the  penalty  for  his  sin  and  hopes  that  Peter  can  avert 
it.  Peter  had  clearly  diagnosed  his  case.  He  was  an  uncon- 
verted man  in  spite  of  his  profession  of  faith  and  baptism. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  109 

There  is  no  evidence  that  he  ever  changed  his  life  at  all. 
Which  (hon).  Genitive  by  attraction  of  the  accusative  rela- 
tive ha  to  case  of  the  unexpressed  antecedent  iouton  (of 
those  things),  a  common  Greek  idiom. 

25.  They  therefore  {hoi  men  oun).  Demonstrative  hoi  with 
men  (no  following  de)  and  the  inferential  oun  (therefore)  as 
often  in  Acts  (1:6,  etc.).  Returned  (hupestrephon).  Imper- 
fect active  picturing  the  joyful  journey  of  preaching  {eueg- 
gelizonto,  imperfect  middle)  to  the  Samaritan  villages.  Peter 
and  John  now  carried  on  the  work  of  Philip  to  the  Samari- 
tans.   This  issue  was  closed. 

26.  Toward  the  South  {kata  mesembrian).  Old  word  from 
mesos  and  hemera,  midday  or  noon  as  in  Acts  22:16,  the 
only  other  example  in  the  N.T.  That  may  be  the  idea 
here  also,  though  "towards  the  South"  gets  support  from 
the  use  of  kata  liba  in  Acts  27:12.  The  same  is  desert 
{haute  estin  eremos).  Probably  a  parenthetical  remark  by 
Luke  to  give  an  idea  of  the  way.  One  of  the  ways  ac- 
tually goes  through  a  desert,  Gaza  itself  was  a  strong 
city  that  resisted  Alexander  the  Great  five  months.  It 
was  destroyed  by  the  Romans  after  war  broke  out  with  the 
Jews. 

27.  A  eunuch  of  great  authority  {eunouchos  dunastes). 
Eunuchs  were  often  employed  by  oriental  rulers  in  high 
posts.  Dynasty  comes  from  this  old  word  dunastes  used  of 
princes  in  Luke  1:52  and  of  God  in  I  Tim.  6:15.  Eunuchs 
were  not  allowed  to  be  Jews  in  the  full  sense  (Deut.  23:1), 
but  only  proselytes  of  the  gate.  But  Christianity  is  spread- 
ing to  Samaritans  and  to  eunuchs.  Candace  {Kandakes). 
Not  a  personal  name,  but  like  Pharaoh  and  Ptolemy,  the 
title  of  the  queens  of  Ethiopia.  This  eunuch  apparently 
brought  the  gospel  to  Ethiopia.  Treasure  {gazes).  Persian 
word,  common  in  late  Greek  and  Latin  for  the  royal  treasure, 
here  only  in  the  N.T.  For  to  worship  {proskuneson).  Future 
active  participle  expressing  purpose,  a  common  idiom  in 


no      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

the  ancient  Greek,  but  rare  in  the  N.T.  (Robertson,  Gram- 
mar, p.   1 1 28). 

28.  Was  reading  {aneginosken).  Imperfect  active  de- 
scriptive, not  periphrastic  like  the  two  preceding  verbs  (was 
returning  and  sitting).  He  was  reading  aloud  as  Philip 
"heard  him  reading"  {ekousen  auton  anaginoskontos),  a  com- 
mon practice  among  orientals.  He  had  probably  purchased 
this  roll  of  Isaiah  in  Jerusalem  and  was  reading  the  LXX 
Greek  text.    See  imperfect  again  in  verse  32. 

29.  Join  thyself  (kolletheti).  See  this  vivid  word  (be  glued 
to,  first  aorist  passive  imperative)  already  in  5:13  and  Luke 
10:11;  15:15.  Philip  probably  jumped  on  the  running  board 
on  the  side  of  the  chariot. 

30.  Understandest  thou  what  thou  readest?  {Ara  ge  ginbs- 
keis  ha  anaginoskeis?)  The  interrogative  particle  ara  and 
the  intensive  particle  ge  indicate  doubt  on  Philip's  part. 
The  play  (paranomasia)  upon  the  words  in  the  Greek  is 
very  neat:  Do  you  know  what  you  know  again  (read)?  The 
verb  for  read  (anaginosko)  means  to  know  the  letters  again, 
recognize,  read.  The  famous  comment  of  Julian  about  the 
Christian  writings  is  often  quoted:  Anegnon,  egndn,  kate- 
gnon  (I  read,  I  understood,  I  condemned).  The  keen  retort 
was:  Anegnos,  all'ouk  egnos,  ei  gar  egnos,  auk  an  kategnos 
(You  read,  but  did  not  understand;  for  if  you  had  under- 
stood, you  would  not  have  condemned). 

31.  How  can  I,  except  some  one  shall  guide  me?  (Pos  gar 
an  dunaimen  ean  me  tis  hodegesei  me?).  This  is  a  mixed  con- 
dition, the  conclusion  coming  first  belongs  to  the  fourth  class 
(undetermined  with  less  likelihood  of  being  determined) 
with  an  and  the  optative,  but  the  condition  {ean,  instead  of 
the  usual  ei,  and  the  future  indicative)  is  of  the  first  class 
(determined  or  fulfilled.  Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1022),  a 
common  enough  phenomenon  in  the  Koine.  The  eunuch 
felt  the  need  of  some  one  to  guide  {hodegeo  from  hodegoSj 
guide,  and  that  from  hodos,  way,  and  hegeomai,  to  lead). 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  1 1 1 

32.  The  place  {he  perioche).  See  the  verb  periechei  so 
used  in  I  Pet.  2:6.  The  word  is  used  either  of  the  section  as 
in  Codex  A  before  the  beginning  of  Mark  or  the  contents  of  a 
passage.  He  was  here  reading  one  particular  passage  (Isa. 
53:7f.).  The  quotation  is  from  the  LXX  which  has  some 
variations  from  the  Hebrew. 

33.  Was  taken  away  (erthe).  First  aorist  passive  indica- 
tive of  airoy  to  take  away.  It  is  not  clear  what  the  meaning 
is  here  either  in  the  Hebrew  or  the  LXX.  Knowling  sug- 
gests that  the  idea  is  that  justice  was  withheld,  done  away 
with,  in  his  death,  as  it  certainly  was  in  the  death  of  Christ. 

34.  Of  whom  (peri  tinos).  Concerning  whom,  a  pertinent 
inquiry  surely  and  one  that  troubles  many  critics  today. 

35.  Beginning  from  this  scripture  {arxamenos  apo  tes 
graphes  tautes).  As  a  text.  Philip  needed  no  better  opening 
than  this  Messianic  passage  in  Isaiah.  Preached  unto  him 
Jesus  {eueggelisato  autbi  ton  lesoun).  Philip  had  no  doubt 
about  the  Messianic  meaning  and  he  knew  that  Jesus  was 
the  Messiah.  There  are  scholars  who  do  not  find  Jesus 
in  the  Old  Testament  at  all,  but  Jesus  himself  did  (Luke 
24:27)  as  Philip  does  here.  Scientific  study  of  the  Old  Testa- 
ment (historical  research)  misses  its  mark  if  it  fails  to  find 
Christ  the  Center  of  all  history.  The  knowledge  of  the  indi- 
vidual prophet  is  not  always  clear,  but  after  events  throw  a 
backward  light  that  illumines  it  all  (I  Pet.  i:iif.;  II  Pet. 
1:19-21). 

36.  What  doth  hinder  me  to  he  baptized?  (Ti  koluei  me  bap- 
tisthenai?).  Evidently  Philip  had  said  something  about 
baptism  following  faith  and  conversion.  Verse  37  is  not  a 
genuine  part  of  Acts,  a  western  addition.  Later  baptismal 
liturgies   had    it. 

39.  Out  of  the  water  {ek  tou  hudatos).  Not  from  the  edge 
of  the  water,  but  up  out  of  the  water  as  in  Mark  i:io. 
Caught  away  (herpasen).  Suddenly  and  miraculously,  for 
harpazo,  like  the  Latin  rapioj  means  to  carry  off.  Cf.  II  Cor. 


112      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

12:2;  I  Thess.  4:17.    Went  on  his  way  {eporeueto).    Kept  on 
going,  imperfect  active. 

40.  He  preached  the  gospel  {eueggelizeto).  Imperfect  middle 
describing  the  evangelistic  tour  of  Philip  "till  he  came  to 
Caesarea"  {hebs  tou  elthein  auton^  genitive  articular  infini- 
tive with  the  preposition  hebs  and  the  accusative  of  general 
reference)  where  he  made  his  home  and  headquarters  there- 
after (Acts  21:28)  and  was  known  as  the  Evangelist. 


CHAPTER   IX 

1,  Yet  (eti).  As  if  some  time_ela^s£d  between  the  death  of 
Stephen  as  is  naturally  implied  by  the  progressive  persecu- 
tion  described  in  8:3.  The  zeal  of  Saul  the  persecutor  in- 
creased with  success.  Breathing  threatening  and  slaughter 
(enpneon  apeiles  kai  phonou).  Present  active  participle  of 
old  and  common  verb.  Not  "breathing  out,"  but  "breath- 
ing in"  (inhaling)  as  in  Aeschylus  and  Plato  or  "breathing 
on"  (from  Homer  on).  The  partitive  genitive  of  apeiles  and 
phonou  means  that  threatening  and  slaughtfirJmd  come  to-be 
the  very  hreaih  that  Saul  breathed,  like  a  warhorse  who  sniffed 
the_smell  of-battle.  He  breathed  on  the  remaining  disciples 
the  murder  that  he  had  already  breathed  in  from  the  death 
of  the  others.  He  exhaled  what  he  inhaled.  Jacob  had  said 
that  "Benjamin  shall  ravin  as  a  wolf!'  (Gen.  49:27).  This 
greatest  son  of  Benjamin  was  fulfilling  this  prophecy  (Fur- 
neaux).  The  taste  of  blood  in  the  death  of  Stephen  was  pleas- 
ing to  young  Saul  (8:1)  and  now  he  revelled  in  the  slaughter 
of  the  saints  both  men  and  women.  In  26:11  Luke  quotes  Paul 
as  saying  that  he  was  "exceedingly  mad  against  them." 

2.  Asked  (eitesato).  First  aorist  middle  indicative,  the 
indirect  middle,  asked  for  himself  (as_a  favour  to  himself). 
Felten  notes  that  "Saul  as  a  Pharisee  makes  request  of 
a  Sadducee"  (the  high  priest)  either  Caiaphas  if  before 
A.D.  35,  but  if  in  36  Jonathan,  son  of  Caiaphas  or  if  in  37 
Theophilus,  another  son  of  Caiaphas.  Letters  {epistolas). 
Julius  Ceasar  and  Augustus  had  granted  the  high  priest  and 
Sanhedrin  jurisdiction  over  Jews  in  foreign  cities,  but  this 
central  ecclesiastical  authority  was  not  always  recognized 
in  every  local  community  outside  of  Judea.  Paul  says  that 
he  received  his  authority  to  go  to  Damascus  from  the  priests

(Acts  26:10)  and  "the  estate  of  the  elders"  (22:5),  that  is 
the  Sanhedrin.  To  Damascus  {eis  Damaskon).  As  if  no 
disciples  of  importance  (outside  the  apostles  in  Jerusalem) 
were  left  in  Judea.  Damascus  at  this  time  may  have  been 
under  the  rule  of  Aretas  of  Arabia  (tributary  to  Rome)  as  it 
certainly  was  a  couple  of  ^earg  later  when  Saul  escaped  in  a 
basket  (II  Cor.  11:32).  Thjs_old  city  is  the  most  enduring 
in  theJhistQty-ofjtheja^Qrld  (Knowling).  It  is  some  150  miles 
Northeast  from  Jerusalem  and  watered  by  the  river  Abana 
from  Anti-Lebanon.  Here  the  Jews  were  strong  in  numbers 
(10,000  butchered  by  Nero  later)  and  here  some  disciples 
had  found  refuge  from  Saul's  persecution  in  Judea  and  still 
worshipped  in  the  synagogues.  Paul's  language  in  Acts  26:11 
seems  to  mean  that  Damascus  is  merely  one  of  other  "foreign 
cities"  to  which  he  carried  the  persecution.  //  he  found 
{ean  heurei).  Third  class  condition  with  aorist  subjunctive 
retained  after  secondary  tense  (asked).  The  Way  {tes  ho- 
dou).  A  common  method  in  the  Acts  for  describing  Chris- 
tianity as  the  Way  of  life,  absolutely  as  also  in  19:9,  23; 
22:4;  24:14,  22  or  the  way  of  salvation  (16:17)  or  the  way 
of  the  Lord  (18:25).  It  is  a  Jewish  definition  of  life  as  in 
Isa.  40:3  "the  way  of  the  Lord,"  Psa.  i  :6  "the  way  of  the 
righteous,"  "the  way  of  the  wicked."  Jesus  called  himself 
"the  way"  (John  14:6),  the  only  way  to  the  Father.  The  so- 
called  Epistle  of  Barnabas  presents  the  Two  Ways.  The 
North  American  Indians  call  Christianity  the  Jesus  Road. 
That  he  might  bring  them  bound  (hopos  dedemenous  agagei). 
.Final  clause  with  hopos  (less  common  than  hina)  and  aorist 
(eflFective)  subjunctive  {agagei,  reduplicated  aorist  of  ago^ 
common  verb)  and  perfect  passive  participle  {dedemenous) 
of  deb,  in  a  state  of  sheer  helplessness  like  his  other  victims 
both  men  and  women.  Three  times  (8:3;  9:2;  22:4)  this 
fact  of  persecuting  women  is  mentioned  as  a  special  hlot  in 
Paul's  rriielty  (the  third  time  by  Paul  himself)  and  one  of 
the  items  in  his  being  chief  of  sinners  (I  Tim.  I  :I5). 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  115 

3.  As  he  journeyed  {en  toi  poreuesthai),  Luke's  common 
idiom  for  a  temporal  clause  (in  the  journeying),  en  with  the 
locative  articular  middle  infinitive.  Drew  nigh  (eggizein). 
Present  active  infinitive,  was  drawing  nigh.  Shone  round 
about  him  {auton  perie  straps  en).  First  aorist  (ingressive) 
active  indicative  of  periastrapto,  late  compound  verb  com- 
mon in  LXX  and  Byzantine  writers,  here  and  22:6  alone  in 
the  N.T.  "A  light  from  heaven  suddenly  flashed  around 
him."  It  was  like  a  flash  of  lightning.  Paul  uses  the  same 
verb  in  22:5,  but  in  26:13  he  employs  perilampsan  (shin- 
ing around).  There  are  numerous  variations  in  the  historical 
narrative  of  Saul's  conversion  in  9:3-18  and  Luke's  report 
of  Paul's  two  addresses,  one  on  the  steps  of  the  Tower  of 
Antonia  facing  the  murderous  mob  (22:6-16),  the  other 
before  Festus  and  Agrippa  (26:12-20).  A  great  deal  of 
capital  has  been  made  of  these  variations  to  the  discredit  of 
Luke  as  a  writer  as  if  he  should  have  made  Paul's  two 
speeches  conform  at  every  point  with  his  own  narrative. 
This  objection  has  no  weight  except  for  those  who  hold 
that  Luke  composed  Paul's  speeches  freely  as  some  Greek 
writers  used  to  do.  But,  if  Luke  had  notes  of  Paul's  speeches 
or  help  from  Paul  himself,  he  naturally  preserved  the  form 
of  the  two  addresses  without  trying  to  make  them  agree 
with  each  other  in  all  details  or  with  his  own  narrative  in 
chapter  9.  Luke  evidently  attached  great  importance  to  the 
story  of  Saul's  conversion  as  the  turning  point  not  simply 
in  the  career  of  the  man,  but  an  epoch  in  the  history  of 
apostolic  Christianity.  In  broad  outline  and  in  all  essentials 
the  three  accounts  agree  and  testify  to  the  truthfulness  of 
the  account  of  the  conversion  of  Saul.  It  is  impossible  to 
overestimate  the  worth  to  the  student  of  Christianity  of  this 
event  from  every  angle  because  we  have  in  Paul's  Epistles 
his  own  emphasis  on  the  actual  appearance  of  Jesus  to  him 
as  the  fact  that  changed  his  whole  life  (I  Cor.  15:8;  Gal. 
i:i6f.).    The  variations  that  appear  in  the  three  accounts 


Il6      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

do  not  mar  the  story,  when  rightly  understood,  as  we  shall 
see.  Here,  for  instance,  Luke  simply  mentions  "a  light 
from  heaven,"  while  in  22:6  Paul  calls  it  "a  great  (hikanon) 
light"  "about  noon"  and  in  26:13  "above  the  brightness  of 
the  sun,"  as  it  would  have  to  be  "at  midday"  with  the  sun 
shining. 

4.  He  fell  upon  the  earth  {pes on  epi  ten  gen).  Second 
aorist  active  participle.  So  in  22.7  Paul  says:  "I  fell  unto 
the  ground"  {epesa  eis  to  edaphos)  using  an  old  word  rather 
than  the  common  gen.  In  26:14  Paul  states  that  "we  were 
all  fallen  to  the  earth"  {panton  katapesonton  hemon  eis  ten 
gen,  genitive  absolute  construction).  But  here  in  verse  7 
"the  men  that  journeyed  with  him  stood  speechless"  {his- 
tekeisan  eneoi).  But  surely  the  points  of  time  are  different. 
In  26:14  Paul  refers  to  the  first  appearance  of  the  vision 
when  all  fell  to  the  earth.  Here  in  verse  7  Luke  refers  to 
what  occurred  after  the  vision  when  both  Saul  and  the  men 
had  risen  from  the  ground.  Saul,  Saul  (Saoul,  Saoul).  The 
Hebrew  form  occurs  also  in  22:7  and  26:14  where  it  is 
expressly  stated  that  the  voice  was  in  the  Hebrew  (Aramaic) 
tongue  as  also  in  9:17  (Ananias).  Deissmann  {Bihle  Studies^ 
p.  316)  terms  this  use  of  Saoul  "the  historian's  sense  of 
liturgical  rhythm."  For  the  repetition  of  names  by  Jesus 
note  Luke  10:41  (Martha,  Martha),  Luke  22:31  (Simon, 
Simon).  Me  {me).  In  persecuting  the  disciples,  Saul  was 
persecuting  Jesus,  as  the  words  of  Jesus  in  verse  5  made 
plain.  Christ  had  already  spoken  of  the  mystic  union  be- 
tween himself  and  his  followers  (Matt.  10:40;  25:40,  45; 
John  15:1-5).  The  proverb  (Pindar)  that  Jesus  quotes 
to  Saul  about  kicking  against  the  goad  is  genuine  in  26:14, 
but  not  here. 

5.  Lord  {kurie).  It  is  open  to  question  if  kurie  should  not 
here  be  translated  "Sir"  as  in  16:30  and  in  Matt.  21 :29  (30); 
John  5:7;  12:21;  20:15;  ^"<^  should  be  so  in  John  9:36.  It 
is  hardly  likely  that  at  this  stage  Saul  recognized  Jesus  as 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  117 

Lord,  though  he  does  so  greet  him  in  22:10  "What  shall  I 
do,  Lord?"  Saul  may  have  recognized  the  vision_as_frQm^ 
,.God  as  Cornelius  says  "LorH^Mn  10:4.  Saul  surrendered 
instantly  as  'Ihomas  did  (John  20:28)  and  as  little  Samuel 
(I  Sam.  3:9).  This  surrender  of  the  will  to  Christ  was  the 
conversion  of  Saul.  He  saw  a  real  Person,  the  Risen  Christ, 
to  whom  he  surrendered  his  life.  On  this  point  he  never 
wavered  for  a  moment  to  the  end. 

6.  The  best  MSS.  do  not  have  "trembling  and  aston- 
ished," and  "What  wilt  thou  have  me  to  do.  Lord.?"  The 
Textus  Receptus  put  these  words  in  here  without  the  author- 
ity of  a  Greek  codex.  See  22:10  above  for  the  genuine  text. 
It  shall  he  told  thee  Qalethesetai).  Future  passive  indicative 
of  laleo.  It  is  hardly  likely  that  Luke  records  all  that  Jesus 
said  to  Saul,  but  more  was  to  come  on  his  arrival  in  Damas- 
cus. Saul  had  received  all  that  he  could  bear  just  now 
Qohn  16:12).  What  (hoti).  Rare  in  Koine  use  of  this  indef- 
inite neuter  relative  in  an  indirect  question,  the  only  example 
in  the  N.T.  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  731).  Human  agents 
like  Ananias  can  finish  what  Jesus  by  supernatural  manifes-  / 
tation  has  here  begun  in  Saul. 

7.  That  journeyed  with  him  {hoi  sunodeuontes  autoi).  Not 
in  the  older  Greek,  but  in  the  Koine,  with  the  associative 
instrumental.  Speechless  (eneoi).  Mute.  Only  here  in  N.T., 
though  old  word.  Hearing  the  voice,  but  beholding  no  man 
{akouontes  men  tes  phones,  medena  de  theorountes).  Two 
present  active  participles  in  contrast  {men,  de).  In  22:9 
Paul  says  that  the  men  "beheld  the  light"  {to  men  phos 
etheasanto),  but  evidently  did  not  discern  the  person.  Paul 
also  says  there,  "but  they  heard  not  the  voice  of  him  that 
spake  to  me"  {ten  de  phonen  ouk  ekousan  tou  lalountos  moi). 
Instead  of  this  being  a  flat  contradiction  of  what  Luke  says 
in  9:7  it  is  natural  to  take  it  as  being  likewise  (as  with  the 
"light"  and  "no  one")  a  distinction  between  the  "sound" 
(original  sense  of  phone  as  in  John  3  :8)  and  the  separate 


Il8      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

words  spoken.  It  so  happens  that  akouo  is  used  either  with 
the  accusative  (the  extent  of  the  hearing)  or  the  genitive 
(the  specifying).  It  is  possible  that  such  a  distinction  here 
coincides  with  the  two  senses  of  phone.  They  heard  the  sound 
(9:7),  but  did  not  understand  the  words  (22:9).  However, 
this  distinction  in  case  with  akouo,  though  possible  and  even 
probable  here,  is  by  no  means  a  necessary  one  for  in  John 
3:8  where  phbnen  undoubtedly  means  "sound"  the  accusa- 
tive occurs  as  Luke  uses  ekousen  phbnen  about  Saul  in  Acts 
9:4.  Besides  in  22:7  Paul  uses  ekousa  phones  about  himself, 
but  ekousa  phonen  about  himself  in  26:14,  interchangeably. 

8.  He  saw  nothing  {ouden  ehlepen).  Imperfect  active  in- 
dicative, was  seeing  nothing.  "The  glory  of  that  light" 
(22:11)  when  he  saw  Jesus  had  blinded  his  eyes  now  wide 
open  {aneoigmenon,  perfect  passive  participle  of  anoigo  with 
double  reduplication).  The  blindness  was  proof  that  some- 
thing had  happened  to  him  and  that  it  was  no  hallucination 
that  he  had  seen  the  Risen  Christ.  Saul  arose  after  the  others 
were  on  their  feet.  They  led  him  by  the  hand  (cheiragogountes) . 
From  cheiragogos  {cheir,  hand  and  ago,  to  lead).  Only  here 
in  the  N.T.,  but  in  LXX  and  late  writers  though  not  in  the 
old  Greek.  It  was  a  pathetic  picture  to  see  the  masterful 
Saul,  victorious  persecutor  and  conqueror  of  the  disciples, 
now  helpless  as  a  child. 

9  Not  seeing  {me  blepdn).  The  usual  negative  me  of  the 
participle.  It  was  a  crisis  for  Saul,  this  sudden  blindness  for 
three  days  {hemeras  treis,  accusative  of  extent  of  time).  Later 
(Gal.  4:15)  Paul  has  an  affection  of  the  eyes  which  may  have 
been  caused  by  this  experience  on  the  road  to  Damascus  or 
at  least  his  eyes  may  have  been  predisposed  by  it  to  weak- 
ness in  the  glare  of  the  Syrian  sun  in  the  land  where  today 
so  much  eye  trouble  exists.  He  neither  ate  nor  drank  any- 
thing, for  his  appetite  had  gone  as  often  happens  in  a  crisis 
of  the  soul.  These  must  have  been  days  of  terrible  stress 
and  strain. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  1 19 

10.  Ananias  {Hananias).  Name  common  enough  (cf.  5:1 
for  another  Ananias)  and  means  "Jehovah  is  gracious." 
Nomen  et  omen  (Knowling).  This  Ananias  had  the  respect 
of  both  Jews  and  Christians  in  Damascus  (22:12).  In  a  vision 
(en  horamati).  Zeller  and  others  scout  the  idea  of  the  historic- 
ity of  this  vision  as  supernatural.  Even  Furneaux  holds 
that  "it  is  a  characteristic  of  the  Jewish  Christian  sources 
to  point  out  the  Providential  ordering  of  events  by  the 
literary  device  of  a  vision,"  as  "in  the  early  chapters  of 
Matthew's  and  Luke's  Gospels."  He  is  content  with  this 
"beautiful  expression  of  the  belief"  with  no  interest  in  the  ac- 
tual facts.  But  that  is  plain  illusion,  not  to  say  delusion,  and 
makes  both  Paul  and  Luke  deceived  by  the  story  of  Ananias 
(9:10-18;  22:12-16,  26).  One  MS.  of  the  old  Latin  Version 
does  omit  the  vision  to  Ananias  and  that  is  basis  enough  for 
those  who  deny  the  supernatural  aspects  of  Christianity. 

11.  To  the  street  (epi  ten  rhumen).  See  on  Luke  14:21.  A 
run  way  (from  rhed,  to  run)  between  the  houses.  So  were  the 
narrow  lanes  or  alleys  called  streets  and  finally  in  later 
Greek  the  word  is  applied  to  streets  even  when  broad. 
Straight  {eutheian).  Most  of  the  city  lanes  were  crooked  like 
the  streets  of  Boston  (old  cow-paths,  people  say),  but  this 
one  still  runs  "in  a  direct  line  from  the  eastern  to  the  western 
gate  of  the  city"  (Vincent).  Since  the  ancients  usually  rebuilt 
on  the  same  sites,  it  is  probable  that  the  line  of  the  street  of 
that  name  today  is  the  same,  though  the  actual  level  has 
been  much  raised.  Hence  the  identification  of  the  house  of 
Ananias  and  the  house  of  Judas  are  very  precarious. 

12.  Coming  in  and  laying  {eiselthonta  kai  epithenta). 
Second  aorist  (ingressive)  active  participles  picturing  the 
punctiliar  act  as  a  sort  of  indirect  discourse  after  verbs  of 
sensation  (Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  1040-2).  Some  ancient 
documents  do  not  have  "in  a  vision"  here.  Receive  his  sight 
(anablepsei) .  First  aorist  active  subjunctive  with  hopos 
(purpose).   See  again  as  in  9:17. 


I20      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

13.  How  much  evil  {hosa  kaka).  How  many  evil  things. 
Saul's  reputation  (26:10)  as  a  persecutor  had  preceded  him. 
To  thy  saints  {tois  hagiois).  Dative  of  disadvantage.  "Used 
here  for  the  first  time  as  a  name  for  the  Christians"  (Know- 
ling),  but  it  came  to  be  the  common  and  normal  (Hackett) 
term  for  followers  of  Christ  (9:32,  41 ;  26:10;  I  Cor.  i  :2,  etc.). 
This  common  word  is  from  to  hagos,  religious  awe  or  reverence 
and  is  applied  to  God's  name  (Luke  1:49),  God's  temple 
(Matt.  24:15),  God's  people  as  set  apart  for  God  (Luke 
1:70;  2:23;  Rom.  1:7,  etc.).  Ananias  in  his  ignorance  saw  in 
Saul  only  the  man  with  an  evil  reputation  while  Jesus  saw  in 
Saul  the  man  transformed  by  grace  to  be  a  messenger  of 
mercy. 

14.  Hath  authority  {echei  exousian).  Probably  Ananias 
had  received  letters  from  the  Christians  left  in  Jerusalem 
warning  him  of  the  coming  of  Saul.  The  protest  of  Ananias 
to  Jesus  against  any  dealing  with  Saul  is  a  fine  illustration 
of  our  own  narrow  ignorance  in  our  rebellious  moods  against 
the  will  of  God. 

15.  A  chosen  vessel  {skeuos  ekloges).  A  vessel  of  choice 
or  selection.  The  genitive  of  quality  is  common  in  the  He- 
brew, as  in  the  vernacular  Koine.  Jesus  chose  Saul  before 
Saul  chose  Jesus,  He  felt  of  himself  that  he  was  an  earthen 
vessel  (II  Cor.  4:7)  unworthy  of  so  great  a  treasure.  It  was  a 
great  message  that  Ananias  had  to  bear  to  Saul.  He  told  it 
in  his  own  way  (9:17;  22:i4f.)  and  in  26:i6f.  Paul  blends 
the  message  of  Jesus  to  Ananias  with  that  to  him  as  one. 
Before  the  Gentiles  {endpion  ton  ethnbn).  This  was  the  chief 
element  in  the  call  of  Saul.  He  was  to  be  an  apostle  to  the 
Gentiles  (Eph.  3:6-12). 

16.  /  will  shew  {hupodeixo).  Beforehand  as  a  warning  as 
in  Luke  3:7  and  from  time  to  time.  He  must  suffer  (dei 
auton  pathein).  Constative  aorist  active  infinitive  {pathein, 
from  pascho)  covering  the  whole  career  of  Saul.  Suffering 
is  one  clement  in  the  call  that  Saul  receives.    He  will  learn 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  1 21 

"how  many  things"  (hosa)  are  included  in  this  list  by  degrees 
and  by  experience.  A  glance  at  II  Cor.  10-12  will  show  one 
the  fulfilment  of  this  prophecy.  But  it  was  the  "gift"  of 
Christ  to  Paul  to  go  on  suffering  (paschein,  present  infini- 
tive, Phil.  1:39). 

17.  Laying  his  hands  on  him  (epithets  ep*  auton  tas  cheiras). 
As  in  the  vision  Saul  saw  (verse  12).  Brother  Saul  {Saoul 
adelphe).  All  suspicion  has  vanished  and  Ananias  takes  Saul 
to  his  heart  as  a  brother  in  Christ.  It  was  a  gracious  word  to 
Saul  now  under  suspicion  on  both  sides.  The  Lord,  even 
Jesus  {ho  kurios,  lesous).  Undoubted  use  of  kurios  as  Lord 
and  applied  to  Jesus.  Who  appeared  {ho  ophtheis).  First 
aorist  passive  participle  of  horao,  was  seen  as  in  26:16  and 
with  the  dative  also  {soi).  Thou  earnest  {erchou).  Imperfect 
indicative  middle,  "thou  wert  coming."  Be  filled  with  the 
Holy  Spirit  {plestheis  pneumatos  hagiou).  This  enduement  of 
special  power  he  will  need  as  an  apostle  (Hackett)  and  as 
promised  by  Jesus  (1:8;  Gal.  2:7). 

18.  Fell  off  {apepesan).  Second  aorist  active  indicative 
(note — an  ending  like  first  aorist)  of  apopipto,  old  verb,  but 
here  alone  in  the  N.T.  As  if  it  were  scales  {hos  lepides). 
Chiefly  late  word  (LXX)  from  lepb,  to  peel,  and  only  here  in 
the  N.T.  See  Tobit  11:13,  "The  white  film  peeled  from  his 
eyes"  {eUpisthe).  Luke  does  not  say  that  actual  "scales"  fell 
from  the  eyes  of  Saul,  but  that  it  felt  that  way  to  him  as  his 
sight  returned,  "as  if"  {hos).  Medical  writers  use  the  word 
lepis  for  pieces  of  the  skin  that  fall  off  (Hobart,  Medical 
Language  of  St.  Luke,  p.  39).  Luke  may  have  heard  Paul 
tell  of  this  vivid  experience.  Was  baptized  {ebaptisthe).  First 
aorist  passive  indicative.  Apparently  by  Ananias  (22:16)  as  a 
symbol  of  the  new  life  in  Christ  already  begun,  possibly  in 
the  pool  in  the  house  of  Judas  as  today  water  is  plentiful 
in  Damascus  or  in  Abana  or  Pharpar  (Furneaux),  better 
than  all  the  waters  of  Israel  according  to  Naaman  (II  Kings 
5:12). 


122      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

19.  fFas  strengthened  (enischuthe).  First  aorist  passive 
indicative  of  enischuo,  to  receive  strength  (ischus),  compara- 
tively late  verb  and  here  only  in  the  N.T.  save  Luke  22:43 
where  it  is  doubtful.  Poor  verse  division.  This  clause  be- 
longs in  sense  to  verse  18.  Some  days  {hemeras  tinas).  An 
indefinite  period,  probably  not  long,  the  early  period  in 
Damascus  before  Saul  left  for  Arabia  (Gal.  1:13-24). 

20.  He  proclaimed  Jesus  {ekerussen  ton  lesoun).  Imper- 
fect indicative,  inchoative,  began  to  preach.  Jesus,  not 
Christ,  is  the  correct  text  here.  He  did  this  first  preaching 
in  the  Jewish  synagogues,  a  habit  of  his  life  when  possible, 
and  following  the  example  of  Jesus.  That  he  is  the  Son  of 
God  (hoti  houtos  estin  ho  huios  tou  theou).  This  is  Paul's 
platform  as  a  Christian  preacher,  one  that  he  always  occupied 
to  the  very  end.  It  was  a  complete  reversal  of  his  previous 
position.  Jesus  had  turned  him  completely  around.  It  is 
the  conclusion  that  Saul  now  drew  from  the  vision  of  the 
Risen  Christ  and  the  message  through  Ananias.  By  "the  Son 
of  God"  Saul  means  the  Messiah  of  promise  and  hope,  the 
Messianic  sense  of  the  Baptist  (John  i  :34)  and  of  Nathanael 
(John  1 :49)  for  Saul  is  now  proclaiming  his  faith  in  Jesus  in 
the  very  synagogues  where  he  had  meant  to  arrest  those  who 
professed  their  faith  in  him.  Peter  laid  emphasis  on  the 
Resurrection  of  Jesus  as  a  glorious  fact  and  proclaimed  Jesus 
as  Lord  and  Christ.  Paul  boldly  calls  Jesus  the  Son  of  God 
with  full  acknowledgment  of  his  deity  from  the  very  start. 
Thomas  had  come  to  this  place  slowly  (John  20:28).  Saul 
begins  with  this  truth  and  never  leaves  it.  With  this  faith 
he  can  shake  the  world.  There  is  no  power  in  any  other 
preaching. 

21.  Were  amazed  (existanto).  Imperfect  middle  indicative 
of  exisiemi.  They  continued  to  stand  out  of  themselves  in 
astonishment  at  this  violent  reversal  in  Saul  the  persecutor. 
Made  havock  (porthesas).  First  aorist  active  participle  of 
porthedy  to  lay  waste,  an  old  verb,  but  only  here  and  Gal. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  123 

1:13,  23  by  Paul,  an  interesting  coincidence.  It  is  the  old 
proverb  about  Saul  among  the  prophets  (I  Sam.  10:12)  re- 
vived with  a  new  meaning  (Furneaux).  Had  come  {elelu- 
thei).  Past  perfect  indicative  active.  Might  bring  {agagei). 
Second  aorist  (effective)  active  subjunctive  of  ago  with 
hina  (purpose).  Bound  {dedemenous).  Perfect  passive  parti- 
ciple of  deo.    Interesting  tenses. 

22.  Increased  the  more  {mdllon  enedunamouto) .  Imperfect 
passive  indicative  of  endunamoo,  to  receive  power  (late 
verb),  progressive  increase  in  strength  as  opposition  grew. 
Saul's  recantation  stirred  controversy  and  Saul  grew  in 
power.  See  also  Paul  in  Phil.  4:13;  T  Tim.  1:12;  II  Tim. 
2:1;  4:17;  Rom.  4:20.  Christ,  the  dynamo  of  spiritual 
energy,  was  now  pouring  power  (Acts  i  :8)  into  Paul  who  is 
already  filled  with  the  Holy  Spirit  (Acts  9:17).  Confounded 
{sunechunnen) .  Imperfect  active  indicative  of  sunchunno 
(late  form  of  sunched,  to  pour  together,  commingle,  make 
confusion.  The  more  Saul  preached,  the  more  the  Jews  were 
confused.  Proving  {sunbibazon).  Present  active  participle 
of  sunbibazo,  old  verb  to  make  go  together,  to  coalesce,  to 
knit  together.  It  is  the  very  word  that  Luke  will  use  in  16:10 
of  the  conclusion  reached  at  Troas  concerning  the  vision  of 
Paul.  Here  Saul  took  the  various  items  in  the  life  of  Jesus 
of  Nazareth  and  found  in  them  the  proof  that  he  was  in 
reality  "the  Messiah"  {ho  Christos).  This  method  of  argu- 
ment Paul  continued  to  use  with  the  Jews  (Acts  17:3).  It 
was  irresistible  argument  and  spread  consternation  among 
the  Jews.  It  was  the  most  powerful  piece  of  artillery  in  the 
Jewish  camp  that  was  suddenly  turned  round  upon  them.  It 
is  probable  that  at  this  juncture  Saul  went  into  Arabia  for 
several  years  (Gal.  i  :i2-24).  Luke  makes  no  mention  of  this 
important  event,  but  he  leaves  ample  room  for  it  at  this 
point. 

23.  When  many  days  were  fulfilled  {Hbs  eplerounto  hemerai 
hikanai).     Imperfect  passive  indicative  of  pleroo,  old  and 


124      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

common  verb,  were  in  process  of  being  fulfilled.  How 
"many"  (considerable,  hikanai,  common  word  for  a  long 
period)  Luke  does  not  say  nor  does  he  say  that  Saul  spent 
all  of  this  period  in  Damascus,  as  we  know  from  Gal.  i  :i6-i8 
was  not  the  case.  Paul  there  states  definitely  that  he  went 
away  from  Damascus  to  Arabia  and  returned  there  before 
going  back  to  Jerusalem  and  that  the  whole  period  was 
about  "three  years"  which  need  not  mean  three  full  years, 
but  at  least  portions  of  three.  Most  of  the  three  years  was 
probably  spent  in  Arabia  because  of  the  two  explosions  in 
Damascus  (before  his  departure  and  on  his  return)  and  be- 
cause he  was  unknown  in  Jerusalem  as  a  Christian  on  his 
arrival  there.  It  cannot  be  argued  from  the  frequent  lacunae 
in  the  Acts  that  Luke  tells  all  that  was  true  or  that  he  knew. 
He  had  his  own  methods  and  aims  as  every  historian  has. 
We  are  at  perfect  liberty  to  supplement  the  narrative  in  the 
Acts  with  items  from  Paul's  Epistles.  So  we  must  assume 
the  return  of  Saul  from  Arabia  at  this  juncture,  between 
verses  22  and  23,  when  Saul  resumed  his  preaching  in  the 
Jewish  synagogues  with  renewed  energy  and  grasp  after 
the  period  of  mature  reflection  and  readjustment  in  Arabia. 
Took  counsel  together  {sunehouleusanto).  First  aorist  (effec- 
tive) middle  indicative  of  sunbouleuo,  old  and  common  verb 
for  counselling  {bouleub)  together  {sun).  Things  had  reached 
a  climax.  It  was  worse  than  before  he  left  for  Arabia.  Paul 
was  now  seeing  the  fulfilment  of  the  prophecy  of  Jesus  about 
him  (9:16).  To  kill  him  (anelein  auton).  Second  aorist 
(effective)  active  infinitive  of  anaireo,  to  take  up,  to  make 
away  with,  to  kill  (Luke  23:32;  Acts  12:1,  etc.).  The  infini- 
tive expresses  purpose  here  as  is  done  in  verse  24  by  hopos 
and  the  aorist  active  subjunctive  of  the  same  verb  (anelosin). 
Saul  now  knew  what  Stephen  had  suffered  at  his  hands  as 
his  own  life  was  in  peril  in  the  Jewish  quarter  of  Damascus. 
It  was  a  picture  of  his  old  self.  He  may  even  have  been 
scourged  here  (II  Cor.   11:24). 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  125 

24.  Plot  {epiboule).  Old  word  for  a  plan  (boule)  against 
(epi)  one.  In  the  N.T.  only  in  Acts  (9:24;  20:3,  19;  23:30). 
They  watched  (pareterounto).  Imperfect  middle  indicative 
of  paratereo,  common  verb  in  late  Greek  for  watching  beside 
{para)  or  insidiously  or  on  the  sly  as  in  Luke  6:7,  they  kept 
on  watching  by  day  and  night  to  kill  him.  In  II  Cor.  11 132 
Paul  says  that  the  Ethnarch  of  Aretas  "kept  guard"  {eph- 
rourei,  imperfect  active  of  phroureo)  to  seize  him.  Probably 
the  Jews  obtained  the  consent  of  the  Ethnarch  and  had  him 
appoint  some  of  them  as  guards  or  watchers  at  the  gate  of 
the  city. 

25.  Through  the  wall  (dia  tou  teichous).  Paul  in  II  Cor. 
II  :33  explains  dia  tou  teichous  as  being  dia  thuridos  (through 
a  window)  which  opened  into  the  house  on  the  inside  of  the 
wall  as  is  true  today  in  Damascus  as  Hackett  saw  there.  See 
Joshua  2:i5f.  (cf.  I  Sam.  19:12)  for  the  way  that  Rahab  let 
out  the  spies  "by  a  cord  through  the  window."  Lowering  him 
{auton  chalasantes).  First  aorist  active  participle  of  chalao, 
old  and  common  verb  in  a  nautical  sense  (Acts  lyiij,  30)  as 
well  as  otherwise  as  here.  Same  verb  used  by  Paul  of  this 
experience  (II  Cor.  11:33).  -^^  ^  basket  {en  sphuridi).  The 
word  used  when  the  four  thousand  were  fed  (Mark  8:8  = 
Matt.  15:37).  A  large  basket  plaited  of  reeds  and  distin- 
guished in  Mark  8:i9f.  (  =  Matt.  i6:9f.)  from  the  smaller 
kophinos.  Paul  uses  sargane,  a  basket  made  of  ropes.  This 
escape  by  night  by  the  help  of  the  men  whom  he  had  come 
to  destroy  was  a  shameful  memory  to  Paul  (II  Cor.  11:33). 
Wendt  thinks  that  the  coincidences  in  language  here  prove 
that  Luke  had  read  II  Corinthians.  That,  of  course,  is 
quite  possible. 

26.  He  assayed  {epeirazen).  Imperfect  active  of  conative 
action.  To  join  himself  {kollasthai).  Present  middle  (direct) 
infinitive  of  conative  action  again.  Same  word  kollao  in 
Luke  15:15  and  Acts  10:28.  See  on  Matt.  19:5  for  discussion. 
fFere  all  afraid  of  him  {pantes  ephobounto  auton).   They  were 


126      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

fearing  him.  Imperfect  middle  picturing  the  state  of  mind 
of  the  disciples  who  had  vivid  recollections  of  his  conduct 
when  last  here.  What  memories  Saul  had  on  this  return 
journey  to  Jerusalem  after  three  years.  He  had  left  a  con- 
quering hero  of  Pharisaism.  He  returns  distrusted  by  the 
disciples  and  regarded  by  the  Pharisees  as  a  renegade  and  a 
turncoat.  He  made  no  effort  to  get  in  touch  with  the  Sanhe- 
drin  who  had  sent  him  to  Damascus.  He  had  escaped  the 
plots  of  the  Jews  in  Damascus  only  to  find  himself  the  object 
of  suspicion  by  the  disciples  in  Jerusalem  who  had  no  proof 
of  his  sincerity  in  his  alleged  conversion.  Not  believing  {me 
pisteuontes).  They  had  probably  heard  of  his  conversion, 
but  they  frankly  disbelieved  the  reports  and  regarded  him 
as  a  hypocrite  or  a  spy  in  a  new  role  to  ruin  them.  fFas 
(estin).  The  present  tense  Is  here  retained  in  indirect  dis- 
course according  to  the  common  Greek  idiom. 

27.  Took  him  {epilabomenos).  Second  aorist  middle  (in- 
direct) participle  of  epilambano,  common  verb  to  lay  hold  of. 
Barnabas  saw  the  situation  and  took  Saul  to  himself  and 
listened  to  his  story  and  believed  it.  It  is  to  the  credit  of 
Barnabas  that  he  had  the  insight  and  the  courage  to  stand 
by  Saul  at  the  crucial  moment  in  his  life  when  the  evidence 
seemed  to  be  against  him.  It  is  a  pleasing  hypothesis  that 
this  influential  disciple  from  Cyprus  had  gone  to  the  Univer- 
sity of  Tarsus  where  he  met  Saul.  If  so,  he  would  know 
more  of  him  than  those  who  only  knew  his  record  as  a  perse- 
cutor of  Christians.  That  fact  Barnabas  knew  also,  but  he 
was  convinced  that  Jesus  had  changed  the  heart  of  Saul 
and  he  used  his  great  influence  (Acts  4:36;  11:22)  to  win 
the  favour  of  the  apostles,  Peter  in  particular  (Gal.  i  :i9)  and 
James  the  half-brother  of  Jesus.  The  other  apostles  were 
probably  out  of  the  city  as  Paul  says  that  he  did  not  sec 
them.  To  the  apostles  {pros  tons  apostolous) .  Both  Barnabas 
and  James  are  termed  apostles  in  the  general  sense,  though 
not  belonging  to  the  twelve,  as  Paul  did  not,  though  himself

later  a  real  apostle.  So  Barnabas  introduced  Saul  to  Peter 
and  vouched  for  his  story,  declared  it  fully  {diegesato,  in 
detail)  including  Saul's  vision  of  Jesus  (eiden  ton  kurion) 
as  the  vital  thing  and  Christ's  message  to  Saul  {elalesen 
autoi)  and  Saul's  bold  preaching  (eparresiasato,  first  aorist 
middle  indicative  of  parresiazo  from  pan — resia  telling  it  all 
as  in  Acts  2:29),  Peter  was  convinced  and  Saul  was  his  guest 
for  two  weeks  (Gal.  i:i8)  with  delightful  fellowship  (his- 
toresai).  He  had  really  come  to  Jerusalem  mainly  "to  visit" 
(to  see)  Peter,  but  not  to  receive  a  commission  from  him. 
He  had  that  from  the  Lord  (Gal.  inf.).  Both  Peter  and 
James  could  tell  Saul  of  their  special  experiences  with  the 
Risen  Christ.  Furneaux  thinks  that  Peter  was  himself  stay- 
ing at  the  home  of  Mary  the  mother  of  John  Mark  (Acts 
12:12)  who  was  a  cousin  of  Barnabas  (Col.  4:10).  This  is 
quite  possible.  At  any  rate  Saul  is  now  taken  into  the  inner 
circle  of  the  disciples  in  Jerusalem. 

28.  Going  in  and  going  out  {eisporeumenos  kai  ekporeuo- 
menos).  Barnabas  and  Peter  and  James  opened  all  the  doors 
for  Saul  and  the  fear  of  the  disciples  vanished. 

29.  Preaching  boldly  (parresiazomenos).  For  a  while. 
Evidently  Saul  did  not  extend  his  preaching  outside  of 
Jerusalem  (Gal.  i  :22)  and  in  the  city  preached  mainly  in 
the  synagogues  of  the  Hellenists  (pros  tous  Hellenistas)  as 
Stephen  had  done  (Acts  8:9).  As  a  Cilician  Jew  he  knew 
how  to  speak  to  the  Hellenists.  Disputed  (sunezeiei).  Im- 
perfect active  of  sunzeteo,  the  very  verb  used  in  6:9  of  the  dis- 
putes with  Stephen  in  these  very  synagogues  in  one  of 
which  (Cilicia)  Saul  had  probably  joined  issue  with  Stephen 
to  his  own  discomfort.  It  was  intolerable  to  these  Hellenistic 
Jews  now  to  hear  Saul  taking  the  place  of  Stephen  and  using 
the  very  arguments  that  Stephen  had  employed.  But  they 
went  about  to  kill  him  {Hoi  de  epecheiroun  anelein  auton). 
Demonstrative  hoi  with  de  and  the  conative  imperfect  of 
epicheireo,  to  put  the  hand  to,  to  try,  an  old  verb  used  in

the  N.T.  only  three  times  (Luke  i  :i;  Acts  9:29;  19:3).  They 
offer  to  Saul  the  same  conclusive  answer  that  he  gave  to 
Stephen,  death.  Paul  tells  how  the  Lord  Jesus  appeared  to 
him  at  this  juncture  in  a  vision  in  the  temple  (Acts  22:17-21) 
with  the  distinct  command  to  leave  Jerusalem  and  how 
Paul  protested  that  he  was  willing  to  meet  the  fate  of  Stephen 
in  whose  death  he  had  a  shameful  part.  That  is  to  Saul's 
credit,  but  the  Lord  did  not  want  Saul  to  be  put  to  death  yet. 
His  crown  of  martyrdom  will  come  later. 

30.  Knew  it  (epignontes).  Second  aorist  active  participle 
of  epiginosko,  to  know  fully.  The  disciples  saw  it  clearly,  so 
they  conducted  {kategagon,  effective  second  aorist  active 
indicative  of  katago).  Sent  forth  {exapesteilan).  Double 
compound  {ex^  out,  apOj  away  or  off).  Sent  him  out  and  off 
to  Tarsus  {eis  Tarson).  Silence  is  preserved  by  Luke.  But 
it  takes  little  imagination  to  picture  the  scene  at  home  when 
this  brilliant  young  rabbi,  the  pride  of  Gamaliel,  returns 
home  a  preacher  of  the  despised  Jesus  of  Nazareth  whose 
disciples  he  had  so  relentlessly  persecuted.  What  will  father, 
mother,  sister  think  of  him  now.** 

31.  So  the  church  {He  men  oun  ekklesia).  The  singular 
ekklesia  is  undoubtedly  the  true  reading  here  (all  the  great 
documents  have  it  so).  By  this  time  there  were  churches 
scattered  over  Judea,  Galilee,  and  Samaria  (Gal.  1:22),  but 
Luke  either  regards  the  disciples  in  Palestine  as  still  members 
of  the  one  great  church  in  Jerusalem  (instance  already  the 
work  of  Philip  in  Samaria  and  soon  of  Peter  in  Joppa  and 
Caesarea)  or  he  employs  the  term  ekklesia  in  a  geographical 
or  collective  sense  covering  all  of  Palestine.  The  strictly 
local  sense  we  have  seen  already  in  8:1  and  3  (and  Matt. 
18:17)  ^^<^  the  general  spiritual  sense  in  Matt.  16:18.  But 
in  Acts  8:3  it  is  plain  that  the  term  is  applied  to  the  organiza- 
tion of  Jerusalem  Christians  even  when  scattered  in  their 
homes.  The  use  of  men  oun  (so)  is  Luke's  common  way 
of  gathering  up  the  connection.     The  obvious  meaning  is 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  129 

that  the  persecution  ceased  because  the  persecutor  had  been 
converted.  The  wolf  no  longer  ravined  the  sheep.  It  is 
true  also  that  the  effort  of  Caligula  a.d.  39  to  set  up  his 
image  in  the  temple  in  Jerusalem  for  the  Jews  to  worship 
greatly  excited  the  Jews  and  gave  them  troubles  of  their 
own  (Josephus,  Ant.  XVIII.  8,  2-9).  Had  peace  (eichen 
eirenen).  Imperfect  active.  Kept  on  having  peace,  enjoying 
peace,  because  the  persecution  had  ceased.  Many  of  the 
disciples  came  back  to  Jerusalem  and  the  apostles  began 
to  make  preaching  tours  out  from  the  city.  This  idiom  {echo 
eirenen)  occurs  again  in  Rom.  5:1  {eirenen  echomen,  present 
active  subjunctive)  where  it  has  been  grievously  misunder- 
stood. There  it  is  an  exhortation jtojceep  on  enjoying  the 
peace  with  God  _alrea(iy-_inade,  not  to  make  peace  with 
God  which  would  be  eirenen  schomen  (ingressive  aorist  sub- 
junctive). Edified  {oikodomoumene) .  j'resent  passive  par- 
ticiple, linear  action  also.  One  result  of  the  enjoyment  of 
peace  after  the  persecution  was  the  continued  edification 
(Latin  word  aedificatio  for_buj1Hing  np  a  hnnsp)^  a  favourite 
figure  with  Paul  (I  Cor.  14;  Eph.  3)  and  scattered  throughout 
the  N.T.,  old  Greek  verb.  In  I  Peter  2:5  Peter  speaks  of  "the 
spiritual  house"  throughout  the  five  Roman  provinces  being 
"built  up"  (cf.  Matt.  16:18).  In  the  comfort  of  the  Holy 
Spirit  {tei  paraklesei  tou  hagiou  pneumatos).  Either  locative 
(in)  or  .instrumental  case  {by).  The  Holy  Spirit  had  been 
promised  by  Jesus  as  "another  Paraclete"  and  now  this  is 
shown  to  be  true.  The  only  instance  in  Acts  of  the  use  of 
paraklesis  with  the  Holy  Spirit.  The  word,  of  course,  means 
jcanin£jto_one^s_side  {parakaleb)  either  for  advice  or  for  con- 
solation. Was  multiplied  {eplethuneto).  Imperfect  middle 
passive.  The  multiplication  of  the  disciples  kept  pace  with 
the  peace,  the  edification,  the  walking  in  the  fear  of  the  Lord, 
the  comfort  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  The  blood  of  the  martyrs  was 
already  becoming  the  seed  of  the  church.  Stephen  had  not 
borne  his  witness  in  vain.

32.  Lydda  (Ludda).  In  O.T.  Lod  (I  Chron.  8:12)  and  near 
Joppa.    Later  Diospolis. 

33.  Aenias  {Ainean).  Old  Greek  name  and  so  probably 
a  Hellenistic  Jew.  He  was  apparently  a  disciple  already 
(the  saint,  verse  32).  Luke  the  physician  notes  that  he 
had  been  bed  ridden  for  eight  years.  See  on  5:15  for  "bed" 
{krahattou)  and  8:7  and  Luke  5:18  for  "paralyzed"  {parale- 
lumenos,  perfect  passive  participle  of  paraluo  with  en,  peri- 
phrastic past  perfect  passive). 

34.  Healeth  {idtai).  Aoristic  present  middle  indicative, 
heals  here  and  now.  Make  thy  bed  {strbson  seautoi).  First 
aorist  (ingressive)  active  imperative  of  stronnumi  {-uo). 
Old  word  with  "bed"  (krabatton)  understood  as  the  object. 
Literally,  spread  thy  bed  for  thyself  (dative  case),  what 
others  for  eight  years  have  done  for  thee. 

35.  Sharon  (Sarona).  The  Plain  of  Sharon,  not  a  town. 
Thirty  miles  long  from  Joppa  to  Caesarea. 

36.  At  Joppa  (En  loppei).  The  modern  Jaffa,  the  port  of 
Jerusalem  (II  Chron.  2:16).  Disciple  {mathetria).  Feminine 
form  of  mathetes,  a  learner  from  manthanb,  to  learn,  a  late 
word  and  only  here  in  the  N.T.  Tabitha  {Tabeitha).  Ara- 
maic form  of  the  Hebrew  Tsebi  and,  like  the  Greek  word 
Dorcas  (Dorkas),  means  Gazelle,  "the  creature  with  the 
beautiful  look"  (or  eyes),  from  derkomai.  The  gazelle  was 
a  favourite  type  for  beauty  in  the  orient  (Song  of  Solomon 
2:9,  17;  4:5;  7:3).  She  may  have  had  both  the  Aramaic 
and  the  Greek  name,  Tabitha  Dorcas  like  John  Mark. 
There  is  nothing  said  about  a  husband  and  so  she  was 
probably  unmarried.  She  is  the  second  woman  mentioned 
by  name  after  Pentecost  (Sapphira  the  other).  She  did  her 
beautiful  deeds  by  herself.  She  did  not  have  a  Dorcas 
society.    Did  {epoiei).    Imperfect  active,  her  habit. 

37.  In  an  upper  chamber  [en  huperoibi).  See  on  1:13. 
Also  in  verse  39.  In  that  house.  This  service  was  rendered 
by  the  women,  though  Luke  has  lousantes  (masculine  plural 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  13  I 

aorist  active  participle  of  loud),  a  general  way  of  saying 
"they  washed."  The  interment  was  not  hurried  as  in 
Jerusalem  (Ananias  and  Sapphira)  and  the  upper  room  is 
where  the  body  was  usually  placed. 

38.  Delay  not  {me  okneseis).  Ingressive  aorist  active 
subjunctive  in  prohibition.  Direct  discourse  and  not  in- 
direct as  late  MSS.  have  (aorist  active  infinitive,  oknesai). 
Possibly  the  two  messengers  started  before  Dorcas  was 
quite  dead,  though  we  do  not  know.  Peter  had  recently 
healed  Aeneas  and  the  disciples  may  have  had  faith  enough 
to  believe  that  he  could  raise  the  dead  by  the  power  of 
Christ.  W.  M.  Ramsay  doubts  if  Dorcas  was  really  dead, 
but  why  see  legends  in  these  supernatural  events.'' 

39.  Stood  by  him  {parestesan  autdi).  Second  aorist  active 
indicative,  intransitive,  of  paristemi).  Vivid  picture  of  this 
group  of  widows  as  they  stood  around  Peter,  weeping 
{klaiousai)  and  showing  {epideiknumenai,  present  middle  as 
belonging  to  themselves,  pointing  with  pride  to)  the  very 
inner  garments  (chitonas)  and  outer  garments  (himatia), 
like  the  Latin  tunica  and  toga,  which  she  made  from  time 
to  time  {epoiei,  imperfect  active,  repeated  action).  It  was  a 
heart-breaking  scene. 

40.  Put  them  all  forth  (ekbalon  exo  pantas).  Second  aorist 
(effective)  active  participle  of  ekballo,  a  rather  strong  word, 
perhaps  with  some  difficulty.  Cf.  Mark  5:40  which  incident 
Peter  may  have  recalled.  The  words  are  not  genuine  in 
Luke  8:54.  Peter's  praying  alone  reminds  one  of  Elijah  (I 
Kings  17:20)  and  the  widow's  son  and  Elisha  for  the  Shu- 
nammite's  son  (II  Kings  4:33).  Tabitha,  arise  {Tabeitha, 
anastethi).  With  sublime  faith  like  Taleitha  koum  of  Jesus 
in  Mark  5:41.  She  sat  up  (anekathisen).  Effective  aorist 
active  indicative  of  anakathizo.  Often  in  medical  writers, 
only  here  in  the  N.T.  and  Luke  7:15  where  Westcott  and 
Hort  have  in  the  margin  the  uncompounded  form  ekathisen. 
Vivid  picture.

41.  Raised  her  up  {anestesen  auien).  First  aorist  active 
indicative,  transitive,  of  anistemi.  Presented  (parestesen). 
First  aorist  active  indicative,  transitive  of  paristemi  (cf. 
intransitive  second  aorist  in  verse  39  above).  It  was  a  joy- 
ful time  for  Peter,  the  widows,  all  the  saints,  and  for  Dorcas. 

43.  Many  days  [hemeras  hikanas).  See  on  verse  23.  Luke 
is  fond  of  the  phrase  and  uses  it  for  time,  number,  size.  It 
might  be  "ten  days,  ten  months,  or  ten  years"  (Page). 
With  one  Simon  a  tanner  {para  tini  Simoni  hursei).  The  use 
of  para  is  usual  for  staying  with  one  (by  his  side).  "The 
more  scrupulous  Jews  regarded  such  an  occupation  as  un- 
clean, and  avoided  those  who  pursued  it.  The  conduct  of 
Peter  here  shows  that  he  did  not  carry  his  prejudices  to  that 
extent"  (Hackett).  One  of  the  rabbis  said:  "It  is  impossi- 
ble for  the  world  to  do  without  tanners;  but  woe  to  him  who 
is  a  tanner."  A  Jewess  could  sue  for  divorce  if  she  discovered 
that  her  husband  was  a  tanner.  And  yet  Peter  will  have 
scruples  on  the  housetop  in  the  tanner's  house  about  eating 
food  considered  unclean.  "The  lodging  with  the  tanner  was 
a  step  on  the  road  to  eating  with  a  Gentile"  (Furneaux). 


CHAPTER  X 

1.  Cornelius  (Kornelios).  The  great  Cornelian  family  of 
Rome  may  have  had  a  freedman  or  descendant  who  is 
centurion  (hekaton-tarches,  leader  of  a  hundred,  Latin  cen- 
turio).  See  on  Matt.  8:5.  These  Roman  centurions  always 
appear  in  a  favourable  light  in  the  N.T.  (Matt.  8:5;  Luke 
7:2;  23:47;  Acts  10:1;  22:25;  27:3).  Furneaux  notes  the 
contrasts  between  Joppa,  the  oldest  town  in  Palestine,  and 
Caesarea,  built  by  Herod;  the  Galilean  fisherman  lodging 
with  a  tanner  and  the  Roman  officer  in  the  seat  of  govern- 
mental authority.  Of  the  band  called  the  Italian  {ek  speires 
tes  kaloumenes  Italikes).  A  legion  had  ten  cohorts  or  "  bands  " 
and  sixty  centuries.  The  word  speires  (note  genitive  in  ~es 
like  the  Ionic  instead  of  -as)  is  here  equal  to  the  Latin 
cohors.  In  the  provinces  were  stationed  cohorts  of  Italic 
citizens  (volunteers)  as  an  Inscription  at  Carnuntum  on  the 
Danube  (Ramsay)  has  shown  (epitaph  of  an  officer  in  the 
second  Italic  cohort).  Once  more  Luke  has  been  vindicated. 
The  soldiers  could,  of  course,  be  Roman  citizens  who  lived 
in  Caesarea.  But  the  Italian  cohorts  were  sent  to  any  part 
of  the  empire  as  needed.  The  procurator  at  Caesarea  would 
need  a  cohort  whose  loyalty  he  could  trust,  for  the  Jews  were 
restless. 

2.  Devout  {eusebes).  Old  word  from  eu  (well)  and  sebomai 
(to  worship,  to  reverence),  but  rare  in  the  N.T.  (Acts  10: 
2,  7;  II  Peter  2:1).  It  might  refer  to  a  worshipful  pagan  (Acts 
17:23,  sebasmata,  objects  of  worship),  but  connected  with 
"one  that  feared  God"  {phoboumenos  ton  theon)  Luke  de- 
scribes "a  God-fearing  proselyte"  as  in  10:22,  35.  This  is 
his  usual  term  for  the  Gentile  seekers  after  God  (13:16,  26; 
17:4,  17,  etc.),  who  had  come  into  the  worship  of  the  syna-

gogue  without  circumcision,  and  were  not  strictly  prose- 
lytes, though  some  call  such  men  "proselytes  of  the  gate" 
(cf.  Acts  13:43);  but  clearly  Cornelius  and  his  family  were 
still  regarded  as  outside  the  pale  of  Judaism  (10:28,  34; 
II  :i,  8;  15:7).  They  had  seats  in  the  synagogue,  but  were 
not  Jews.  Gave  much  alms  {poion  eleemosunas  pollas). 
Doing  many  alms  (the  very  phrase  in  Matt.  6:2),  a  char- 
acteristic mark  of  Jewish  piety  and  from  a  Gentile  to  the 
Jewish  people.  Prayed  {deomenos).  Begging  of  God.  Alms- 
giving and  prayer  were  two  of  the  cardinal  points  with  the 
Jews  (Jesus  adds  fasting  in  his  picture  of  the  Pharisee  in 
Matt.    6:1-18). 

3.  Coming  in  {eiselthonta).  Ingressive  second  aorist  active 
participle,  not  present.  So  punctiliar,  "saw  come,"  not 
"saw  coming."  So  also  "say"  or  "speak,"  not  "saying." 
Luke  repeats  the  account  of  this  vision  to  Cornelius  twice 
(10:30;  11:13)  ^^'^  ^Iso  the  story  of  the  vision  to  Peter 
(10:1-16,  28;  11:5). 

4.  Lord  (kurie).  Cornelius  recognizes  the  angel  of  God 
(verse  3)  as  God's  messenger.  Jre  gone  up  {anehesan). 
Timeless  second  aorist  active  indicative  of  anabaino.  Gone 
up  like  the  smoke  of  incense  in  sacrifices.  For  a  memorial 
(eis  mnemosunon).  Old  word  from  mnemon.  The  only  other 
instance  in  the  N.T.  is  by  Jesus  about  the  act  of  Mary  of 
Bethany  (Matt.  26:13;  Mark  14:9).  His  prayers  and  his 
alms  proved  his  sincerity  and  won  the  ear  of  God. 

5.  Fetch  (metapempsai).  First  aorist  middle  (indirect, 
for  one's  self)  imperative  of  metapempo,  usual  voice  in 
ancient  Greek  with  this  verb  in  sense  of  sending  another  for 
one's  own  sake.   Only  in  Acts  in  the  N.T.   See  also  10:22. 

6.  Lodgeth  (xenizetai).  Present  passive  indicative  of 
xenizb  old  verb  from  xenos,  a  stranger  as  a  guest.  So  to  en- 
tertain a  guest  as  here  or  to  surprise  by  strange  acts  (Acts 
17:20;  I  Peter  4:4).  Whose  {hoi).  To  whom,  dative  of  posses- 
sion.    By  the  seaside  {para  thalassan).     Along  by  the  sea. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  135 

Note  accusative  case.  Outside  the  city  walls  because  a 
tanner  and  to  secure  water  for  his  trade.  Some  tanneries 
are  by  the  seashore  at  Jaffa  today. 

8.  Rehearsed  {exegesamenos).  See  on  Luke  24:35.  All 
the  details  about  the  vision.  The  soldier  was  "devout"  like 
Cornelius  and  would  protect  the  two  household  servants 
[oiketon). 

9.  On  the  morrow  {tei  epaurion).  Locative  case  of  article 
with  the  compound  adverb  {hemerdi  day  being  understood), 
the  second  day  after  leaving  Caesarea,  28  miles  from  Joppa. 
The  third  day  (the  next  morrow,  verse  23)  they  start  back 
home  and  the  fourth  day  (on  the  morrow  again,  verse  24) 
they  reach  Caesarea.  As  thsy  (ekeinon).  The  party  of  three 
from  Caesarea.  Genitive  absolute  with  present  participle 
hodoiporounton  (journeying)  and  eggizonton  (drew  nigh). 
The  housetop  {to  doma).  Old  word  and  in  Gospels  (Luke 
3:19,  etc.),  but  only  here  in  Acts,  From  demo,  to  build,  and 
so  any  part  of  the  building  (hall,  dining  room,  and  then  roof). 
The  roof  was  nearly  flat  with  walls  around  and  so  was  a 
good  place  for  meditation  and  prayer  and  naps. 

10.  Hungry  {prospeinos).  Only  instance  of  the  word 
known,  a  hapax  legomenon.  Probably  "very  hungry" 
(^roj  =  besides,  in  addition).  Desired  (ethelen).  Imperfect 
active.  Was  longing  to  eat.  It  was  about  twelve  o'clock 
noon  and  Peter  may  even  have  smelt  the  savory  dishes, 
"while  they  made  ready"  (paraskeuazonton) .  "The  natural 
and  the  supernatural  border  closely  on  one  another,  with  no 
definable  limits"  (Furneaux).  He  fell  into  a  trance  {ege- 
neto  ep^  auion  ek stasis).  More  exactly,  "An  ecstasy  came 
upon  him,"  in  which  trance  he  passed  out  of  himself  {ekstasisj 
from  exist emi)  and  from  which  one  came  to  himself  (12:11). 
Cf.  also  11:5  and  22:17.  I^  is  thus  different  from  a  vision 
{horama)  as  in  verse  3. 

11.  Beholdeth  itheorei).  Vivid  historical  present  and 
change    from    past    time.       Opened    {aneoigmenon,    perfect

passive  participle  with  double  reduplication,  state  of  comple- 
tion). Descending  {katabainon).  Present  active  participle 
describing  the  process.  Sheet  (othonen).  Old  word  for  linen 
cloth  and  only  here  in  the  N.T.  Accusative  case  in  apposi- 
tion with  skeuos  (vessel).  Let  down  {Kathiemenon) .  Present 
passive  participle  of  Kathiemi.  Old  verb,  but  in  the  N.T. 
only  here  and  Luke  5:19  and  Acts  9:25.  Linear  action  here 
picturing  the  process,  ** being  let  down."  By  four  corners 
{tessarsin  archais).  Instrumental  case  of  arche,  beginning. 
We  say  "end"  or  extremity  for  this  use  of  the  word.  The 
picture  is  the  sheet  held  up  by  four  cords  to  which  the  sheet 
is  fastened.  Isa.  11:12  had  said  that  Israel  would  be  gathered 
from  the  four  corners  of  the  earth.  Knowling  follows  Hobart 
in  taking  the  four  corners  of  the  sheet  to  be  a  medical  phrase 
for  bandage  (the  end  of  a  bandage). 

12.  Were  {huperchen).  Imperfect  of  huparcho  in  sense  of 
en,  to  exist,  be.  Fish  are  not  mentioned,  perhaps  because  the 
sheet  had  no  water,  though  they  were  clean  and  unclean 
also  (Lev.  11:9;  Deut.  14:9).  All  manner  0/  {panto).  Lit- 
erally, all,  but  clearly  all  varieties,  not  all  individuals.  Both 
clean  and  unclean  animals  are  in  the  sheet. 

14.  Not  so,  Lord  {Medamos,  kurie).  The  negative  meda- 
mos  calls  for  the  optative  eie  (may  it  not  be)  or  the  impera- 
tive est 5  (let  it  be).  It  is  not  oudamos,  a  blunt  refusal  (I 
shall  not  do  it).  And  yet  it  is  more  than  a  mild  protest  as 
Page  and  Furneaux  argue.  It  is  a  polite  refusal  with  a  rea- 
son given.  Peter  recognizes  the  invitation  to  slay  (tkuson) 
the  unclean  animals  as  from  the  Lord  (kurie)  but  declines 
it  three  times.  For  I  have  never  eaten  anything  (hoti  oudepote 
ephagon  pan).  Second  aorist  active  indicative,  I  never  did 
anything  like  this  and  I  shall  not  do  it  now.  The  use  of  pan 
(everything)  with  oudepote  (never)  is  like  the  Hebrew  (/o — 
kol)  though  a  like  idiom  appears  in  the  vernacular  KoinS 
(Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  752).  Common  and  unclean  {koinon 
kai  akatharton).    Koinos  from  epic  xunos  (xun^  sun^  together

with)  originally  meant  common  to  several  (Latin  communis) 
as  in  Acts  2:44;  4:32;  Tit.  1:4;  Jude  3.  The  use  seen  here 
(also  Mark  7:2,  5;  Rom.  14:14;  Heb.  10:29;  R^v.  21:27; 
Acts  10:28;  11:8),  like  Latin  vulgaris  is  unknown  in  ancient 
Greek.  Here  the  idea  is  made  plain  by  the  addition  of 
akatharton  (unclean),  ceremonially  unclean,  of  course.  We 
have  the  same  double  use  in  our  word  ''common."  See  on 
Mark  7:i8f.  where  Mark  adds  the  remarkable  participle 
katharizon  (making  all  meats  clean),  evidently  from  Peter 
who  recalls  this  vision.  Peter  had  been  reared  from  child- 
hood to  make  the  distinction  between  clean  and  unclean 
food  and  this  new  proposal  even  from  the  Lord  runs  against 
all  his  previous  training.  He  did  not  see  that  some  of  God's 
plans  for  the  Jews  could  be  temporary.  This  symbol  of  the 
sheet  was  to  show  Peter  ultimately  that  Gentiles  could  be 
saved  without  becoming  Jews.  At  this  moment  he  is  in 
spiritual  and  intellectual  turmoil. 

15.  Make  not  thou  common  (su  me  koinou).  Note  emphatic 
position  of  su  (thou).  Do  thou  stop  making  common  what 
God  cleansed  (ekatharisen).  The  idiom  of  me  with  the  pres- 
ent active  imperative  koinou  means  precisely  this.  Peter 
had  just  called  "common"  what  God  had  invited  him  to 
slay  and  eat. 

16.  Thrice  (epitris) .  For  three  times.  Peter  remained  uncon- 
vinced even  by  the  prohibition  of  God.  Here  is  a  striking  il- 
lustration of  obstinacyiQiUlie  part  of  one  who  acknowledges 
jJT^_v2ir^  '^f  G^d  to  him  whfn  the  ^'^mmand  nf  thf^jjjTrd 
crosses  one's  preferP"<'P'?  ^^id  prejndirps.  There  are  abundant 
examples  today  of  precisely  this  thing.  In  a  real  sense  Peter 
was  maintaining  a  pose  of  piety  beyond  the  will  of  the  Lord. 
Peter  was  defiling  what  God  had  cleansed.  fFas  received  up 
{anelemphthe) .  First  aorist  passive  indicative  of  analambano, 
to  take  up.  The  word  used  of  the  Ascension  (i  :22). 

17.  Was  much  perplexed  in  himself  {en  heautoi  dieporei). 
Imperfect    active    of    diaporeo,    intensive    compound    {dia,

^t  a  loss  to  know  what  road  to  take.  Old  verb,  but  in  N.T. 
only  in  Luke  and  Acts.  Page  notes  that  Luke  is  singularly 
fond  of  verbs  compounded  with  dia.  See  on  Luke  9:7  and 
Acts  2:12.  Wh£iiJi]iLofthe^cstasy  he  was  rnore  puzzled  than 
ever.  Might  be  {an  eie).  Optative  with  an  in  indirect  ques- 
tion simply  retained  from  the  direct  (Robertson,  Grammar^ 
pp.  102 1,  1044).  See  Acts  17:18,  for  the  direct  ano  Luke 
1:62  for  the  indirect  [an  theloi  both  times).  It  is  the  con- 
clusion of  a  fourth  class  condition.  Having  made  inquiry 
{dierotes antes).  First  aorist  active  participle  of  dierotaOy 
another  compound  of  dia,  to  ask  one  after  another,  to  ask 
through,  old  verb,  but  only  here  in  the  N.T.  It  took  diligent 
inquiry  to  find  the  obscure  house  of  Simon  the  tanner. 
Stood  before  the  gate  {epestesan  epi  ton  pulona).  Second  aorist 
active  indicative  of  ephistemi,  intransitive.  Note  repetition 
of  epi.  The  messengers  stopped  right  at  the  folding  gates  of 
the  passage  (pulona)  which  led  from  the  street  to  the  inner 
court  or  house. 

18.  Called  {phone sanies).  In  a  loud  voice  that  those  inside 
the  house  might  hear.  Asked  {epunthanonto).  Imperfect 
middle  of  punthanomai,  old  verb  to  make  inquiry  especially 
with  an  indirect  question  as  here._Kegt_on_iiiqiiiring.  West- 
cott  and  Hort  follow  B  C  here  and  read  epuihonto  (second 
aorist  middle,  effective  aorist).  Either  makes  sense,  though 
the  imperfect  is  more  picturesque.  Were  lodging  {xenizetai). 
Present  middle  indicative  retained  in  indirect  question. 
See  on  verse  6  for  the  verb. 

19.  Thought  {dienthumoumenou) .  Genitive  absolute  of 
present  middle  participle  of  dienthumeomai,  a  double  com- 
pound {dia  and  en-  with  thumos)  and  another  hapax  lego- 
menon  save  in  ecclesiastical  writers,  though  enihumeomai  is 
common  enough  and  Textus  Receptus  so  reads  here.  Peter 
was  revolving  in  his  mind,  through  and  through,  in  and  out, 
to  find  the  meaning  of  the  strange  vision. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  139 

20.  But  (alia).  So  usually,  though  it  is  open  to  question 
whether  alia  is  adversative  here  and  not  rather,  "Now 
then."  Get  thee  down  {katahethi).  Second  aorist  active  im- 
perative, at  once.  Go  (poreuou).  Present  middle  imperative, 
go  on.  Nothing  doubting  {meden  diakrinomenos) .  Another 
compound  of  dia,  old  and  common  verbJorLj^diYlded  mind 
{dia  like  duo,  two).  Note  usual  negative  of  the  present  middle 
participle,  the  subjective  meden.  The  notion  of  wavering 
Qames.  i  :6)  is  common  with  this  verb  in  the  middle  voice. 
In  Acts  11:12  the  aorist  active  {meden  diakrinanta)  Is  used 
perhaps  with  the  idea  of  conduct  towards  others  rather 
than  his  own  internal  doubt  as  here  (Page).  For  I  {hoti 
ego).  The  Holy  Spirit  assumes  responsibility  for  the  mes- 
sengers from  Cornelius  and  thus  connects  their  mission  with 
the  vision  which  was  still  troubling  Peter.  Peter  had  heard 
his  name  called  by  the  man  (verse  19). 

21.  Cause  (aitia).  Or  reason.  Common  in  this  sense. 
See  on  Matt.   19:3. 

22.  Righteous  (dikaios).  In  the  Jewish  sense  as  in  Luke 
1 :6;  2:25.  Well  reported  of  (marturoumenos) .  Present  passive 
participle  as  in  6:3.  Cf.  the  other  centurion  in  Luke  7:4. 
Nation  (ethnous).  Not  laou,  for  the  speakers  are  Gentiles. 
Was  warned  (echrematisthe) .  First  aorist  passive  of  chre^ 
matizo,  old  word  for  doing  business,  then  consulting  an 
oracle,  and  here  of  being  divinely  (word  God  not  expressed) 
warned  as  in  Matt.  2:12,  22;  Luke  2:26;  Heb.  11:7.  Then  to 
be  called  or  receive  a  name  from  one's  business  as  in  Acts 
11:26;  Rom.  7:3. 

23.  Lodged  them  {exenisen).  Active  voice  here  rather  than 
passive  as  in  10:6.  Accompanied  him  {sunelthan  autoi). 
Associative  instrumental  case  after  verb.  The  wisdom  of 
having  these  half  dozen  Jewish  Christians  from  Joppa  with 
Peter  in  the  house  of  Cornelius  in  Caesarea  becomes  manifest 
in  Jerusalem   (11:12). 

24.  Was  waiting  {en  prosdokbn).    Periphrastic  imperfect 


^

active,  in  eager  expectation  and  hope,  directing  the  mind 
{dokao)  towards  {pros)  anything.  Old  and  common  verb. 
Near  {anagkaious).  Only  instance  in  the  N.T.  of  this  sense 
of  anagkaios  from  anagke,  necessity,  what  one  cannot  do 
without,  necessary  (I  Cor.  12:22),  duty  (Acts  13 :46),  or  blood 
relations  as  here.  The  ancient  Greek  writers  combined 
these  two  words  {suggeneis,  kinsmen,  anagkaious,  necessary 
friends)  as  here.  It  was  a  homogeneous  group  of  Gentiles 
close  to  Cornelius  and  predisposed  to  hear  Peter  favourably. 

25.  That  Peter  entered  {tou  eiselthein  ton  Petron).  This 
is  a  difficult  construction,  for  the  subject  of  egeneto  (it  hap- 
pened) has  to  be  the  articular  genitive  infinitive  tou  eiselthein 
with  the  accusative  of  general  reference  ton  Petron.  Most 
commentators  consider  it  inexplicable.  It  is  probably  an 
extension  of  the  ordinary  articular  infinitive  under  the  in- 
fluence of  the  Hebrew  infinitive  construct  without  regard 
to  the  case,  regarding  it  as  a  fixed  case  form  and  so  using  it  as 
nominative.  Precisely  this  construction  of  tou  and  the  in- 
finitive as  the  subject  of  a  verb  occurs  in  the  LXX  (II  Chron. 
6:7,  etc.).  See  Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  loSyi.  for  full  dis- 
cussion of  this  obvious  Hebraism.  Somewhat  similar  ex- 
amples appear  in  Acts  20:3;  27:1.  But  the  Codex  Bezae 
avoids  this  awkward  idiom  by  the  genitive  absolute  (proseg- 
gizontos  tou  Petrou)  and  some  additional  details  (one  of  the 
servants  ran  forward  and  announced  that  he  was  come). 
Worshipped  him  (prosekunesen).  "Cornelius  was  not  an 
idolator  and  would  not  have  honoured  Peter  as  a  god" 
(Furneaux).  The  word  probably  means  here  reverence  like 
old  English  usage  (Wycliff)  and  not  actual  worship,  though 
Peter  took  it  that  way  (verse  26).  Jesus  accepted  such 
worship  (Matt.  8:2;  Luke  5:8  by  Peter). 

27.  Js  he  talked  with  him  {sunomilon  autoi).  Present 
active  participle  of  sunomileo,  rare  compound  and  here 
alone  in  the  N.T.,  with  associative  instrumental  case.  The 
uncompounded  verb  is  common  enough  though  in  the  N.T. 


I

only  in  Luke  24:14  which  see  and  Acts  20:1 1 ;  24:26.  Findeth 
{heuriskei).  Vivid  historical  present  indicative  active. 
Come  together  {suneleluthotas) .  Second  perfect  active  par- 
ticiple of  sunerchomai.  It  was  an  expectant  group  of  Gen- 
tiles eager  for  Peter's  interpretation  of  the  vision  of  Cor-^ 
nelius. 

28.  How  that  it  is  an  unlawful  thing  [hos  athemiton  estin). 
The  conjunction  hos  is  sometimes  equivalent  to  hoti  (that). 
The  old  form  of  athemitos  was  athemistos  from  themistos 
{themizOy  themis,  law  custom)  and  a  privative.  In  the  N.T. 
only  here  and  I  Peter  4:3  (Peter  both  times).  But  there  is 
no  O.T.  regulation  forbidding  such  social  contact  with 
Gentiles,  though  the  rabbis  had  added  it  and  had  made  it 
binding  by  custom.  There  is  nothing  more  binding  on  the 
average  person  than  social  custom.  On  coming  from  the 
market  an  orthodox  Jew  was  expected  to  immerse  to  avoid 
defilement  (Edersheim,  Jewish  Social  Life,  pp.  26-28;  Tay- 
lor's Sayings  of  the  Jewish  Fathers,  pp.  15,  26,  137,  second 
edition).  See  also  Acts  11:3;  Gal.  2:12.  It  is  that  middle 
wall  of  partition  between  Jew  and  Gentile  (Eph.  2:14)  which 
Jesus  broke  down.  One  of  another  nation  (allophuloi) .  Dative 
case  of  an  old  adjective,  but  only  here  in  the  N.T.  {alios, 
another,  phulon,  race).  Both  Juvenal  (Sat.  XIV.  104,  105) 
and  Tacitus  (History,  V.  5)  speak  of  the  Jewish  exclusiveness 
and  separation  from  Gentiles.  And  yet  unto  {k'amoi).  Dative 
of  the  emphatic  pronoun  (note  position  of  prominence)  with 
kai  (crasis)  meaning  here  "and  yet"  or  adversative  "but" 
as  often  with  kai  which  is  by  no  means  always  merely  the 
connective  "and"  (Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  ii82f.).  Now 
Peter  takes  back  both  the  adjectives  used  in  his  protest 
to  the.Lord  (verse  14)  "common  and  unclean."  It  is  a  long 
journey  that  Peter  has  made.  He  here  refers  to  "no  one" 
(medena),  not  to  "things,"  but  that  is  great  progress. 

29.  Without  gainsaying  (anantirrhetos).    A  privative  with 
compound  adverb  from  anti  (back,  in  return,  against)  and 


142      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

verbal  rhetos  (from  errhethen^  to  speak).  Late  and  rare  and 
here  only  in  the  N.T.,  but  the  adjective  in  19:36.  Without 
answering  back.  That  is  true  after  the  Holy  Spirit  expressly 
told  Peter  to  go  with  the  messengers  of  Cornelius  (10:19-23). 
Peter's  objections  were  made  to  the  Lord  in  the  vision  which 
he  did  not  understand.  But  that  vision  prepared  him  for  this 
great  step  which  he  had  now  taken.  He  had  stepped  over  the 
line  of  Jewish  custom.  With  what  intent  {tini  logoi).  More 
exactly,  '*for  what  reason"  as  in  Plato,  Gorgias  512  C. 

30.  Four  days  ago  {apo  tetartes  hemeras).  From  the  fourth 
day,  reckoning  backwards  from  this  day,  /  was  keeping  the 
ninth  hour  of  prayer  {emen  ten  enaten  proseuchomenos). 
Periphrastic  middle  imperfect  and  accusative  of  extension 
of  time  (all  the  ninth  hour). 

31.  Is  heard  {eisekousthe) .  Sort  of  timeless  first  aorist 
passive  indicative  as  is  "are  had  in  remembrance"  {emnes- 
thesan.   See  verse  4  "are  gone  up  for  a  memorial"). 

32.  In  the  house  of  Simon  {en  oikidi  Simonos).  See  9:43 
for  para  Simoni  with  same  idea. 

33.  And  thou  hast  well  done  that  thou  art  come  {su  te  kalos 
epoiesas  paragenomenos) .  "And  thou  didst  well  in  coming." 
A  regular  formula  for  expressing  thanks  as  in  Phil.  4:14; 
III  John  6;  II  Peter  i  -.K).  The  participle  completes  the  idea 

I  of  kalos  poied  neatly.  Cornelius  commends  Peter  for  his 
courage  in  breaking  away  from  Jewish  custom  and  takes  no 
offence  at  the  implied  superiority  of  the  Jews  over  the  Gen- 
tiles. Cornelius  and  his  circle  of  kinsmen  and  close  friends 
are  prepared  soil  for  a  new  era  in  the  history  of  Christianity. 
The  Samaritans  were  now  nominal  Jews  and  the  Ethiopian 
eunuch  was  a  single  case,  but  here  Peter  the  chief  apostle, 
not  Philip  the  preaching  deacon  (evangelist),  was  involved. 
It  was  a  crisis.  Cornelius  reveals  an  open  mind  for  the  mes- 
sage of  God  through  Peter.  Commanded  thee  {prostetagmena 
sot).  Perfect  passive  participle  with  the  dative  case  (soi). 
Cornelius   is   a   military   man   and   he  employs   a   military 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  143 

term  {prostasso,  old  word  to  command).  J|e  is  ready  for 
orders  from  the  Lord. 

34.  Opened  his  mouth  {anoixas  to  stoma).  Solemn  formula 
for  beginning  his  address  (8:35;  18:14;  Matt.  5:2;  13:35). 
But  also  good  elocution  for  the  speaker.  /  perceive  (katal- 
ambanomai) .  Aoristic  present  middle  of  katalambano,  to  take 
hold  of,  the  middle  noting  mental  action,  to  lay  hold  with 
the  mind  (Acts  4:13;  10:34;  25:25;  Eph.  3:18).  It  had  been 
a  difficult  thing  for  Peter  to  grasp,  but  now  "of  a  truth" 
(ep*  aletheias)  the  light  has  cleared  away  the  fogs.  It'was 
not  until  Peter  had  crossed  the  threshold  of  the  house  of 
Cornelius  in  the  new  environment  and  standpoint  that  he 
sees  this  new  and  great  truth.  Respecter  of  persons  (proso- 
polemptes).  This  compound  occurs  only  here  and  in  Chry- 
sostom.  It  is  composed  of  prosbpon  face  or  person  {pros  and 
ops,  before  the  eye  or  face)  and  lamhano.  The  abstract  form 
prosopolempsia  occurs  in  James  2:1  (also  Rom.  2:11;  Eph. 
6:9;  Col.  3:25)  and  the  verb  prosdpolempteo  in  James  2:9. 
The  separate  phrase  {lambanein  prosopon)  occurs  in  Luke 
20:21  and  Gal.  2:6.  The  phrase  was  already  in  the  LXX 
(Deut.  10:17;  II  Chron.  19:7;  Psa.  82:6).  Luke  has  simply 
combined  the  two  words  into  one  compound  one.  The  idea 
is  to  pay  regard  to  one's  looks  or  circumstances  rather  than 
to  his  intrinsic  character.  The  Jews  had  come  to  feel  that 
they  were  the  favourites  of  God  and  actually  sons  of  the 
kingdom  of  heaven  because  they  were  descendants  of  Abra- 
ham.   John  the  Baptist  rebuked  them  for  this  fallacy. 

35.  Acceptable  to  him  (dektos  autoi).  Verbal  adjective 
from  dechomai.  Acceptabilis.  That  is  to  say,  a  Gentile 
would  not  have  to  becorrie  a  Jew  in  order  to  become  a  Chris- 
tian. Evidently  Peter  had  not  before  perceived  this  fact. 
On  the  great  Day  of  Pentecost  when  he  spoke  of  the  promise 
"to  all  those  afar  off"  (2:39)  Peter  understood  that  they 
must  first  become  Jews  and  then  Christians.  The  new  idea 
that  now  makes  a  revolution  in  Peter's  outlook  is  precisely 


144      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

this  that  Christ  can  and  will  save  Gentiles  like  this  Cornelius 
group  without  their  becoming  Jews  at  all. 

36.  The  word  which  he  sent  {ton  logon  hon  apesteilen). 
Many  ancient  MSS.  (so  Westcott  and  Hort)  read  merely 
ton  logon  apesteilen  (he  sent  the  word).  This  reading  avoids 
the  anacoluthon  and  inverse  attraction  of  logon  to  the  case 
of  the  relative  hon  (which).  Preaching  good  tidings  of  peace 
through  Jesus  Christ  {euaggelizomenos  eirenen  dia  lesou 
Christou).  Gospelizing  peace  through  Jesus  Christ.  There 
is  no  other  way  to  have  real  peace  between  individuals  and 
God,  between  races  and  nations,  than  by  Jesus  Christ. 
Almost  this  very  language  occurs  in  Eph.  2:17  where  Paul 
states  that  Jesus  on  the  cross  "preached  (gospelized)  peace 
to  you  who  are  afar  off  and  peace  to  you  who  are  near." 
Peter  here  sees  what  Paul  will  see  later  with  great  clearness. 
He  is  Lord  of  all  {houtos  estin  panton  kurios).  A  triumphant 
parenthesis  that  Peter  throws  in  as  the  reason  for  his  new 
truth.  Jesus  Christ  is  Lord  of  all,  both  Jews  and  Gentiles. 

37.  Ye  know  (humeis  oidate).  Peter  reminds  his  Gentile 
audience  that  the  main  facts  concerning  Jesus  and  the 
gospel  were  known  to  them.  Note  emphatic  expression  of 
humeis  (you).  Beginning  {arxamenos).  The  Textus  Re- 
ceptus  has  arxamenon  (accusative),  but  the  nominative  is 
given  by  Aleph  A  B  C  D  E  H  and  is  certainly  correct.  But 
it  makes  a  decided  anacoluthon.  The  accusative  would  agree 
with  rhema  used  in  the  sense  of  message  or  story  as  told  by 
^he  disciples.  The  nominative  does  not  agree  with  any- 
thing in  the  sentence.  The  same  phrase  occurs  in  Luke 
23:5.  Here  is  this  aorist  middle  participle  almost  used  like 
an  adverb.  See  a  similar  loose  use  of  arxamenos  in  the  same 
sense  by  Peter  in  Acts  i  :22.  The  baptism  of  John  is  given  as 
the  terminus  a  quo.  The  story  began  with  a  skip  to  Galilee 
after  the  baptism  just  like  the  Gospel  of  Mark.  This  first 
message  of  Peter  to  the  Gentiles  (10:37-44)  corresponds  in 
broad  outline  with  Mark's  Gospel.   Mark  heard  Peter  preach 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  145 

many  times  and  evidently  planned  his  Gospel  (the  Roman 
Gospel)  on  this  same  model.  There  is  in  it  nothing  about 
the  birth  and  childhcjd  of  Jesus  nor  about  the  intervening 
ministry  supplied  by  John's  Gospel  for  the  period  (a  year) 
between  the  baptism  and  the  Galilean  Ministry.  Peter  here 
presents  an  objective  statement  of  the  life,  death,-  and  resur- 
rection of  Jesus  with  proof  from  the  Scriptures  that  he  is  the 
Messiah.    It  is  a  skilful  presentation. 

38.  Jesus  of  Nazareth  (lesoun  ton  apo  Nazareth).  Jesus  the 
one  from  Nazareth,  the  article  before  the  city  identifying 
him  clearly.  The  accusative  case  is  here  by  prolepsis,  Jesus 
being  expressed  for  emphasis  before  the  verb  "anointed" 
and  the  pronoun  repeated  pleonastically  after  it.  "Jesus 
transfers  the  mind  from  the  gospel-history  to  the  personal 
subject  of  it"  (Hackett).  God  anointed  him  {echrisen,  auton, 
ho  theos).  First  aorist  active  of  the  verb  chrio,  to  anoint, 
from  which  the  verbal  Christos  is  formed  (Acts  2:36).  The 
precise  event  referred  to  by  Peter  could  be  the  Incarnation 
(Luke  i:35f.),  the  Baptism  (Luke  3:22),  the  Ministry  at 
Nazareth  (Luke  4:14).  Why  not  to  the  life  and  work  of 
Jesus  as  a  whole.''  fVent  about  doing  good  {dielthen  euer- 
geton).  Beautiful  description  of  Jesus.  Summary  (consta- 
tive)  aorist  active  of  dierchomai,  to  go  through  (dia)  or  from 
place  to  place.  The  present  active  participle  euergeton  is 
from  the  old  verb  euergeteo  {eu,  well,  ergon,  work)  and  occurs 
only  here  in  the  N.T.  The  substantive  euergetes  (benefactor) 
was  often  applied  to  kings  like  Ptolemy  Euergetes  and  that 
is  the  sense  in  Luke  22:25  the  only  N.T.  example.  But  the 
term  applies  to  Jesus  far  more  than  to  Ptolemy  or  any  earthly 
king  (Cornelius  a  Lapide).  And  healing  {kai  iomenos). 
And  in  particular  healing.  Luke  does  not  exclude  other  dis- 
eases (cf.  Luke  13:11,  16),  but  he  lays  special  emphasis  on 
demoniacal  possession  (cf.  Mark  1:23).  That  were  oppressed 
{tous  katadunasteuomenous) .  Present  passive  articular  par- 
ticiple of  katadunasteub.   A  late  verb  in  LXX  and  papyri.

In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  James  2:6  (best  MSS.)-  One  of 
the  compounds  of  kata  made  transitive.  The  reality  of  the 
devil  (the  slanderer,  diabolos)  is  recognized  by  Peter.  For 
God  was  with  him  {hoti  ho  iheos  en  met'  autou).  Surely  this  rea- 
son does  not  reveal  "a  low  Christology"  as  some  charge. 
Peter  had  used  the  same  language  in  Acts  7:9  and  earlier  in 
Luke  1 :28,  66  as  Nicodemus  does  in  John  3 :2. 

39.  And  we  are  witnesses  {kai  hemeis  manures).  Compare 
"ye  yourselves  know"  (verse  37).  Peter  thus  appeals  to 
what  the  audience  know  and  to  what  the  disciples  know. 
He  made  the  same  claim  about  personal  witnesses  of  the 
Resurrectionof  Jesus  at  Pentecost  (2:32).  Here  Peter  affirms 
full  knowledge  of  the  work  of  Jesus  in  Judea  (for  whole 
country  including  Galilee  and  Perea)  and  Jerusalem  (given 
mainly  in  John's  Gospel).  In  the  Greek  hon  (which)  is 
attracted  into  the  genitive  case  to  agree  with  the  antecedent 
panton  (all),  a  common  enough  idiom.  Whom  also  they 
slew  (hon  kai  aneilan).  Second  aorist  active  indicative  of 
anaireb  with  a  as  often  in  Acts  (2:23;  5:30).  But  note  kai 
(also)  in  the  old  MSS.,  not  in  the  Textus  Receptus.  They 
*'also"  slew  him,  went  that  far,  "this  crowning  atrocity" 
(Vincent),  kai  could  here  be  "even."  Hanging  him  on  a 
tree  {kremasantes  epi  xulou).  This  same  expression  used  by 
Peter  in  5:30  which  see  for  discussion. 

40.  Gave  him  to  be  made  manifest  {edbken  auton  emphane 
genesthai).  Peculiar  phrase,  here  only  in  the  N.T.  and  in 
Rom.  10:20  (quoted  from  Isa.  65:1).  Emphane,  predicate 
accusative  after  infinitive  genesthai  agreeing  with  auton 
object  of  eddken. 

41.  Chosen  before  {prokecheirotonemenois).  Perfect  pas- 
sive participle  dative  plural  from  procheirotoneo,  to  choose 
or  designate  by  hand  {cheirotoneo,  cheir,  hand,  and  teino,  to 
stretch,  as  in  Acts  14:23;  II  Cor.  8:19),  beforehand  (pro), 
a  double  compound  as  old  as  Plato,  but  here  alone  in  the 
N.T.     Peter  is  evidently  stating  the  thing  as  it  happened 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  147 

and  not  trying  to  make  a  convincing  story  by  saying  that 
both  friends  and  foes  saw  him  after  his  resurrection.  It  is 
the  "historian's  candour"  (Paley)  in  Luke  here  that  adds 
to  the  credibility  of  the  narrative.  The  sceptical  Jews  would 
not  have  believed  and  Jesus  was  kept  from  open  contact 
with  the  world  of  sin  after  his  Passion.  To  us  who  did  eat 
and  drink  with  him  {hemin  hoitines  sunephagomen  kai  sune- 
piomen  autoi).  The  "who"  {hoitines)  is  first  person  agreeing 
with  "us"  {hemin).  Second  aorist  active  indicative  of  the 
common  verbs  sunesthio  and  sumpino.  Autoi  is  associative 
instrumental  case.  There  are  difficulties  to  us  in  understand- 
ing how  Jesus  could  eat  and  drink  after  the  resurrection  as 
told  here  and  in  Luke  24:41-3,  but  at  any  rate  Peter  makes 
it  clear  that  it  was  no  hallucination  or  ghost,  but  Jesus  him- 
self whom  they  saw  after  he  rose  from  the  dead,  "after  the 
rising  as  to  him"  {meta  to  anastenai  auton,  meta  with  the 
accusative  articular  infinitive  second  aorist  active  and  the 
accusative  auton  of  general  reference).  Furneaux  dares  to 
think  that  the  disciples  misunderstood  Jesus  about  eating 
after  the  resurrection.  But  that  is  to  deny  the  testimony 
merely  because  we  cannot  explain  the  transition  state  of  the 
body  of  Jesus. 

42.  He  charged  {pareggeilen).  First  aorist  active  indica- 
tive as  in  1:4.  There  Jesus  is  the  subject  and  so  probably 
here,  though  Page  insists  that  ho  theos  (God)  is  here  because 
of  verse  40.  To  testify  {diamarturasthai) .  First  aorist  middle 
infinitive.  See  on  2:40.  Ordained  {hbrismenos) .  Perfect 
passive  participle  of  horizo,  old  verb,  to  mark  out,  to  limit, 
to  make  a  horizon.  Judge  {krites).  The  same  point  made  by 
Peter  in  I  Peter.  4:5.  He  does  not  use  the  word  "Messiah" 
to  these  Gentiles  though  he  did  say  "anointed"  {echrisen) 
in  verse  38.  Peter's  claim  for  Jesus  is  that  he  is  the  Judge 
of  Jew  and  Gentile  (living  and  dead). 

43.  Every  one  that  believeth  {panta  ton  pisteuonta).  This 
accusative  active  participle  of  general  reference  with  the 


148      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

infinitive  in  indirect  discourse  is  the  usual  idiom.  Only 
labein  (second  aorist  active  infinitive  of  lambano)  is  not 
indirect  statement  so  much  as  indirect  command  or  arrange- 
ment. The  prophets  bear  witness  to  Jesus  Christ  to  this 
effect.  It  is  God's  plan  and  no  race  distinctions  are  drawn. 
Peter  had  already  said  the  same  thing  at  Pentecost  (2:38), 
but  now  he  sees  himself  that  Gentiles  do  not  have  to  be- 
came Jews,  but  have  only  to  believe  in  Jesus  as  Messiah 
and  Judge  as  foretold  by  the  prophets.  It  was  glorious  news 
to  Cornelius  and  his  group.  Through  his  name  {dia  tou 
onomatos  autou),  not  as  a  title  or  magic  formula  (Acts 
18:13),  but  the  power  of  Christ  himself  represented  by 
his  name. 

44.  While  Peter  yet  spake  {eti  lalountos  tou  Petrou).  Geni- 
tive absolute  of  present  participle,  still  going  on.  The  Holy 
Ghost  fell  (epepesen  to  pneuma  to  hagion).  Second  aorist 
active  indicative  of  epipipto,  old  verb  to  fall  upon,  to  re- 
cline, to  come  upon.  Used  of  the  Holy  Spirit  in  8:16;  10:44; 
11:15.  It  appears  that  Peter  was  interrupted  in  his  sermon 
by  this  remarkable  event.  The  Jews  had  received  the  Holy 
Spirit  (2:4),  the  Samaritans  (8:17),  and  now  Gentiles.  But 
on  this  occasion  it  was  before  baptism,  as  was  apparently 
true  in  Paul's  case  (9:i7f.).  In  8:16  and  in  19:5  the  hands 
of  the  apostles  were  also  placed  after  baptism  on  those  who 
received  the  Holy  Spirit.  Here  it  was  unexpected  by  Peter 
and  by  Cornelius  and  was  Indubitable  proof  of  the  conver- 
sion of  these  Gentiles  who  had  accepted  Peter's  message  and 
had  believed  on  Jesus  Christ  as  Saviour. 

45.  They  of  the  circumcision  which  believed  {hoi  ek  peri- 
tomes  pistoi).  The  believing  ones  of  the  circumcision,  more 
exactly.  Were  amazed  (exestesan).  Second  aorist  active 
indicative,  intransitive,  of  existemi.  They  stood  out  of 
themselves.  On  the  Gentiles  also  {kai  epi  ta  ethne).  Or,  even 
upon  the  Gentiles.  Was  poured  out  {ekkechutai).  Present 
perfect  passive  retained  in  indirect  discourse  of  ekched  or 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  149 

ekchuno,  old  verb,  used  metaphorically  of  the  Holy  Spirit 
also  in  2:17  (from  Joel  2:28f.),  33- 

46.  They  heard  {ekouon).  Imperfect  active,  were  hearing, 
kept  on  hearing.  Speak  (lalountdn).  Present  active  partici- 
ple, speaking,  for  they  kept  it  up.  fVith  tongues  (glossais). 
Instrumental  case  as  in  2:4,  11  which  see.  The  fuller  state- 
ment there  makes  it  clear  that  here  it  was  new  and  strange 
tongues  also  as  in  19:6  and  I  Cor.  14:4-19.  This  sudden 
manifestation  of  the  Holy  Spirit's  power  on  uncircumcised 
Gentiles  was  probably  necessary  to  convince  Peter  and  the 
six  brethren  of  the  circumcision  that  God  had  opened  the 
door  wide  to  Gentiles.  It  was  proof  that  a  Gentile  Pente- 
cost had  come  and  Peter  used  it  effectively  in  his  defence  in 
Jerusalem  (Acts  11:15). 

47.  Can  any  man  forbid  the  water?  {Meti  to  hudor  dunatai 
kolusai  tis?).  The  negative  meti  expects  the  answer  No. 
The  evidence  was  indisputable  that  these  Gentiles  were 
converted  and  so  were  entitled  to  be  baptized.  See  the 
similar  idiom  in  Luke  6:39.  Note  the  article  with  "water." 
Here  the  baptism  of  the  Holy  Spirit  had  preceded  the  bap- 
tism of  water  (Acts  1:5;  11:16).  "The  greater  had  been 
bestowed;  could  the  lesser  be  withheld.'"'  (Knowling). 
That  these  should  not  he  baptized  (tou  me  baptisthenai  toutous). 
Ablative  case  of  the  articular  first  aorist  passive  infinitive 
of  baptizo  with  the  redundant  negative  after  the  verb  of 
hindering  (kolHsai)  and  the  accusative  of  general  reference 
(toutous).  The  redundant  negative  after  the  verb  of  hinder- 
ing is  not  necessary  though  often  used  in  ancient  Greek  and 
in  the  Koine  (papyri).  Without  it  see  Matt.  19:14;  Acts 
8:36  and  with  it  see  Luke  4:42;  24:16;  Acts  14:18.  Cf. 
Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  1061,  1094,  Ii7i«  The  triple 
negatives  here  are  a  bit  confusing  to  the  modern  mind  {meti 
in  the  question,  kolHsai,  to  hinder  or  to  cut  off,  me  with 
baptisthenai).  Literally,  Can  any  one  cut  off  the  water  from 
the  being  baptized  as  to  these.''    Meyer:  "The  water  is  in

this  animated  language  conceived  as  the  element  offering 
itself  for  the  baptism."  As  well  as  we  {hos  kai  hemeis).  The 
argument  was  conclusive.  God  had  spoken.  Note  the  query 
of  the  eunuch  to  Philip  (Acts  8:36). 

48.  Commanded  (prosetaxen).  First  aorist  active  indica- 
tive. Peter  himself  abstained  from  baptizing  on  this  occa- 
sion (cf.  Paul  in  I  Cor.  i  :i4).  Evidently  it  was  done  by  the 
six  Jewish  brethren.  Them  to  be  baptized  {autous  baptisth- 
inai).  Accusative  of  general  reference  with  the  first  aorist 
passive  infinitive.  In  the  name  of  Jesus  Christ  {en  toi  onomati 
lesou  Christou).  The  essential  name  in  Christian  baptism  as 
in  2:38  and  19:5.  But  these  passages  give  the  authority  for 
the  act,  not  the  formula  that  was  employed  (Alvah  Hovey 
in  Hackett's  Commentary.  See  also  chapter  on  the  Bap- 
tismal Formula  in  my  The  Christ  of  the  Logia).  "Golden 
days"  {aurei  di^Sf  Bengel)  were  these  for  the  whole  group. 


CHAPTER  XI 

1.  In  Judea  (kata  ten  loudaian).  Throughout  Judea 
(probably  all  Palestine),  distributive  use  of  kata.  The  news 
from  Casearea  spread  like  wildfire  among  the  Jewish  Chris- 
tians. The  case  of  the  Samaritans  was  different,  for  they 
were  half  Jews,  though  disliked.  But  here  were  real  Ro- 
mans even  if  with  Jewish  affinities.  Had  received  (edexanio). 
First  aorist  middle  indicative.  The  English  idiom  requires 
"had"  received,  the  Greek  has  simply  "received." 

2.  They  that  were  of  the  circumcision  {hoi  ek  peritomes). 
Literally,  those  of  circumcision  (on  the  side  of  circumcision, 
of  the  circumcision  party).  The  phrase  In  10:46  is  confined 
to  the  six  brethren  with  Peter  in  Caesarea  (11:12).  That 
can  hardly  be  the  meaning  here  for  it  would  mean  that  they 
were  the  ones  who  brought  the  charge  against  Peter  though 
Hort  takes  this  view.  All  the  disciples  in  Jerusalem  were 
Jews  so  that  it  can  hardly  mean  the  whole  body.  In  Gal. 
2:12  the  phrase  has  the  narrower  sense  of  the  Judaizing  or 
Pharisaic  wing  of  the  disciples  (Acts  15:5)  who  made  cir- 
cumcision necessary  for  all  Gentile  converts.  Probably 
here  by  anticipation  Luke  so  describes  the  beginning  of  that 
great  controversy.  The  objectors  probably  did  not  know  of 
Peter's  vision  at  Joppa,  but  only  of  the  revolutionary  con- 
duct of  Peter  in  Caesarea.  These  extremists  who  spoke 
probably  had  abundant  sympathy  in  their  protest.  The 
apostles  are  mentioned  in  verse  i,  but  are  not  referred  to  in 
verse  2.  Apparently  they  are  in  contrast  with  the  circum- 
cision party  in  the  church.  Contended  (diekrinonto).  Imper- 
fect middle  of  the  common  verb  diakrino,  to  separate.  Here 
to  separate  oneself  apart  {dia)^  to  take  sides  against,  to  make 
a  cleavage  {dia^  two,  in  two)  as  in  Jude  9.    So  Peter  is  at 

151

once  put  on  the  defensive  as  the  contention  went  on.  It  is 
plain  that  Peter  was  not  regarded  as  any  kind  of  pope  or 
overlord. 

3.  Thou  wentest  in  (eiselthes).  Direct  form,  but  Westcott 
and  Hort  have  it  eiselthen  (he  went  in),  indirect  form.  So 
with  sunephages  (didst  eat)  and  sunephagen  (did  eat).  The 
direct  is  more  vivid.  Men  uncircumcised  {andras  akrobus- 
tian  echontas).  "Men  having  uncircumcision."  It  is  a  con- 
temptuous expression.  They  did  not  object  to  Peter's 
preaching  to  the  Gentiles,  but  to  his  going  into  the  house  of 
Cornelius  and  eating  with  them,  violating  his  supposed 
obligations  as  a  Jew  (Hackett).  It  was  the  same  complaint 
in  principle  that  the  Pharisees  had  made  against  Jesus  when 
he  ate  with  publicans  and  sinners  (Luke  15:12).  The  Jews 
had  not  merely  the  Mosaic  regulations  about  clean  and  un- 
clean food,  but  also  the  fact  that  at  a  Gentile  table  some  of 
the  meat  may  have  been  an  idol  sacrifice.  And  Peter  himself 
had  similar  scruples  when  the  vision  came  to  him  at  Joppa 
and  when  he  entered  the  house  of  Cornelius  in  Caesarea 
(10:28).    Peter  had  been  led  beyond  the  circumcision  party. 

4.  Began  (arxamenos).  Not  pleonastic  here,  but  graph- 
ically showing  how  Peter  began  at  the  beginning  and  gave 
the  full  story  of  God's  dealings  with  him  in  Joppa  and  Caesa- 
rea. Expounded  (exetitheto) .  Imperfect  middle  of  ektithemiy 
to  set  forth,  old  verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  in  Acts  (7:21; 
11:4;  18:26;  28:23),  ^  deliberate  and  detailed  narrative 
**in  order"  (katkexes).  Old  word  for  in  succession.  In  the 
N.T.  only  in  Luke  1:2;  8:1;  Acts  3:24;  11:14;  18:23.  Luke 
evidently  considered  this  defence  of  Peter  important  and  he 
preserves  the  marks  of  authenticity.  It  came  originally  from 
Peter  himself  (verses  5,  6,  15,  16).  "The  case  of  Cornelius 
was  a  test  case  of  primary  importance"  (Page),  "the  first 
great  difficulty  of  the  early  Church."  Part  of  the  story  Luke 
gives  three  times  (10:3-6,  30-32;  Ii:i3f.).  See  the  discus- 
sion chapter  10  for  details  given  here. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  153 

5.  Let  down  {kathiemenen).  Here  agreeing  with  the 
*' sheet"  {othonen,  feminine),  not  with  "vessel"  (skeuos, 
neuter)  as  in  10:11.  Even  unto  me  (achriemou).  Vivid  detail 
added  here  by  Peter. 

6.  When  I  had  fastened  my  eyes  (atenisas).  This  personal 
touch  Peter  adds  from  his  own  experience.  See  on  Luke 
4:20;  Acts  3  4,  12  for  this  striking  verb  atenizOj  to  stretch  the 
eyes  towards,  first  aorist  active  participle  here.  /  considered 
(  katanoeo).  Imperfect  active  of  kataneoo  to  put  the  mind 
down  on,  to  ponder,  I  was  pondering.  And  saw  {kai  eidon). 
Second  aorist  active  indicative,  saw  in  a  flash. 

7.  A  voice  saying  {phones  legouses).  Genitive  case  after 
ekousa  (cf.  9:7  and  accusative  9:4  which  see  for  discussion). 
Participle  legouses  (present  active  of  lego)  agreeing  with 
phones,  a  kind  of  indirect  discourse  use  of  the  participle. 

8.  Came  into  my  mouth  {eiselthen  eis  to  stoma  mou).  In- 
stead of  ephagon  (I  ate)  in  10:14.  Different  phrase  for  the 
same  idea. 

10.  Was  drawn  up  {anespasthe).  Instead  of  anelempthe 
(was  taken  up)  in  10:16.  First  aorist  passive  indicative  of 
anaspao,  old  verb,  but  in  N.T.  only  in  Luke  14:5  and  here. 

12.  Making  no  distinction  {meden  diakrinanta) .  So  West- 
cott  and  Hort  (first  aorist  active  participle)  instead  of 
meden  diakrinomenon  "nothing  doubting"  (present  middle 
participle)  like  10:20.  The  difference  in  voice  shows  the 
distinction  in  meaning.  We  entered  into  the  man's  house 
{eiselthomen  eis  ton  oikon  tou  andros).  Peter  confesses  it, 
but  shows  that  the  other  six  went  in  also.  He  avoids  men- 
tion of  Cornelius's  name  and  office. 

13.  Standing  and  saying  {stathenta  kai  eiponta).  More 
precisely,  "stand  and  say"  (punctiliar  act,  first  aorist  pas- 
sive and  second  aorist  active  participles).  Fetch  Simon 
{metapempsai  Simona).  First  aorist  middle  imperative. 
Third  time  mentioned  (10:5,  22;  11:13).  Perhaps  Peter  is 
anxious  to  make  it  plain  that  he  did  not  go  of  his  own  initia- 


154      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

tive  into  the  house  of  Cornelius.     He  went  under  God's 
direct  orders. 

14.  Whereby  thou  shall  be  saved,  thou  and  all  thy  house  {en 
hois  sothesei  su  kai  pas  ho  oikos  sou).  Future  passive  indic- 
ative of  jozo,  to  save.  Clearly  Cornelius  was  unsaved  in 
spite  of  his  interest  in  Jewish  worship.  Clearly  also  the 
household  of  Cornelius  would  likewise  be  won  to  Christ  by 
the  words  of  Simon  Peter.  This  is  household  conversion 
before  the  household  baptism  (10:48;  11:17). 

15.  As  I  began  to  speak  {en  toi  arxasthai  me  lalein).  En 
with  the  locative  of  the  articular  aorist  infinitive  arxasthai 
(punctiliar  action  simply)  and  the  accusative  of  general 
reference.  The  second  infinitive  lalein  (to  speak)  is  depend- 
ent on  arxasthai,  "In  the  beginning  to  speak  as  to  me." 
Even  as  on  us  at  the  beginning  {hosper  kai  epW  hemds  en 
archei).  Peter  recalls  vividly  the  events  at  Pentecost,  the 
speaking  with  tongues  and  all.  It  is  noteworthy  that  Peter 
does  not  here  repeat  his  sermon.  "He  rests  his  defence,  not 
on  what  he  said,  but  on  what  God  did"  (Furneaux). 

16.  /  remembered  {emnesthen).  First  aorist  passive  indica- 
tive of  the  common  verb  mimnesko,  to  remind.  Peter  recalls 
the  very  words  of  Jesus  as  reported  in  Acts  i  :5.  Peter  now 
understands  this  saying  of  Jesus  as  he  had  not  done  before. 
That  is  a  common  experience  with  us  all  as  new  experiences 
of  grace  open  richer  veins  in  God's  truth  (John  12:16). 
Peter  clearly  sees  that  the  water  baptism  is  merely  the  sym- 
bol or  picture  of  the  spiritual  baptism  in  the  heart. 

17.  The  like  gift  {ten  is  en  dorean).  The  equal  gift,  equal 
in  quality,  rank,  or  measure.  Common  word.  When  we  be- 
lieved {pisteusasin).  First  aorist  active  participle  oi  pisteuo 
in  the  dative  case.  It  agrees  both  with  hemin  (unto  us)  and 
with  autois  (unto  them),  "having  believed  on  the  Lord  Jesus 
Christ."  Both  classes  (Gentiles  and  Jews)  trusted  in  Christ, 
and  both  received  the  Holy  Spirit.  Who  was  I  {ego  tis 
emen).    Note  order,  "/,  who  was  I."    "That  I  could  with- 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  155 

stand  God''''  (dunatos  kolusai  ton  theon).  Literally,  "able  to 
withstand  or  hinder  God."  It  is  a  rhetorical  question,  really 
two  questions.  Who  was  I.'*  Was  I  able  to  hinder  God.'*  Peter's 
statement  of  the  facts  made  an  unanswerable  defence.  And 
yet  Peter  (Gal.  2:11)  will  later  in  Antioch  play  the  coward 
before  emissaries  from  Jerusalem  on  this  very  point  of  eating 
with  Gentile  Christians. 

18.  Held  their  peace  Qiesuchasan).  Ingressive  aorist 
active  indicative  of  hesuchazo,  old  verb  to  be  quiet,  to  keep 
quiet.  The  wrangling  (verse  2)  ceased.  The  critics  even 
"glorified  God"  {edoxasan,  ingressive  aorist  again).  Then 
to  the  Gentiles  also  {Ara  kai  tois  ethnesin).  Ergo  as  in  Luke 
11:20,  48  and  like  ara  oun  in  Rom.  5:18.  In  ancient  Greek 
inferential  ara  cannot  come  at  the  beginning  of  a  clause  as 
here.  It  was  reluctant  acquiescence  in  the  undoubted  fact 
that  God  had  "granted  repentance  unto  life"  to  these 
Gentiles  in  Caesarca,  but  the  circumcision  party  undoubtedly 
looked  on  it  as  an  exceptional  case  and  not  to  be  regarded  as 
a  precedent  to  follow  with  other  Gentiles.  Peter  will  see  in 
this  incident  (Acts  15:8)  the  same  principle  for  which  Paul 
contends  at  the  Jerusalem  Conference.  Furneaux  suggests 
that  this  conduct  of  Peter  in  Caesarea,  though  grudgingly 
acquiesced  in  after  his  skilful  defence,  decreased  his  in- 
fluence in  Jerusalem  where  he  had  been  leader  and  helped 
open  the  way  for  the  leadership  of  James  the  Lord's  brother. 

19.  They  therefore  that  were  scattered  abroad  {hoi  men  oun 
diasparentes).  Precisely  the  same  words  used  in  8:4  about 
those  scattered  by  Saul  (which  see)  and  a  direct  reference  to  it 
is  made  by  the  next  words,  "upon  the  tribulation  that  arose 
about  Stephen"  {apo  tes  thlipseos  tes  genomenes  epi  Sieph- 
anoi).  As  a  result  of  (apo),  in  the  case  of  (epi)  Stephen. 
From  that  event  Luke  followed  Saul  through  his  conversion 
and  back  to  Jerusalem  and  to  Tarsus.  Then  he  showed  the 
activity  of  Peter  outside  of  Jerusalem  as  a  result  of  the 
cessation  of  the  persecution  from  the  conversion  of  Saul  with 


156      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

the  Gentile  Pentecost  in  Caesarea  and  the  outcome  in  Jeru- 
salem. Now  Luke  starts  over  again  from  the  same  persecu- 
tion by  Saul  and  runs  a  new  line  of  events  up  to  Antioch 
parallel  to  the  other,  probably  partly  following.  Except  to 
Jews  only  {ei  me  monon  loudaiois).  Clearly  these  disciples 
did  not  know  anything  about  the  events  in  Caesarea  and 
at  first  their  flight  preceded  that  time.  But  it  was  a  wonder- 
ful episode,  the  eager  and  loyal  preaching  of  the  fleeing 
disciples.  The  culmination  in  Antioch  was  probably  after 
the  report  of  Peter  about  Caesarea.  This  Antioch  by  the 
Orontes  was  founded  300  B.C.  by  Seleucus  Nicator  and  was 
^_ne  of  five  cities  so  named  by  the  Seleucides.  It  became  the 
metropolis  of  Syria  though  the  Arabs  held  Damascus  first. 
Antioch  ranked  next  to  Rome  and  Alexandria  in  size,  wealth, 
power,  and  vice.  There  were  many  Jews  in  the  cosmopolitan 
population  of  half  a  million.  It  was  destined  to  supplant 
Jerusalem  as  the  centre  of  Christian  activity. 

20.  Spake  (elaloun).  Inchoative  imperfect  active,  began 
to  speak.  For  them  it  was  an  experiment.  Unto  the  Greeks 
also  {kai  pros  tous  Hellenas).  This  Is  undoubtedly  the  cor- 
rect reading  in  spite  of  Hellenists  {Hellenistas)  or  Grecian 
Jews  in  B  E  H  L  P.  Hellenas  is  read  by  A  and  D  and  a  cor- 
rector of  Aleph.  The  presence  of  "also"  or  "even"  (kai) 
in  Aleph  A  B  makes  no  sense  unless  "Greeks"  is  correct. 
Hellenists  or  Grecian  Jews  as  Christians  were  common 
enough  as  is  seen  in  Acts  2  and  6.  Saul  also  had  preached  to 
the  Hellenists  in  Jerusalem  (9:29).  Hellenists  were  merely 
one  kind  of  Jews  in  contrast  with  those  who  spoke  Aramaic 
(Acts  6).  It  is  true  that  the  case  of  Cornelius  was  first  in 
importance,  but  it  is  not  clear  that  It  was  before  the  work  in 
Antioch.  Probably  the  report  of  the  work  among  the  Greeks 
in  Antioch  reached  Jerusalem  after  Peter's  defence  In  1 1 : 
1-18.  That  explains  the  calm  tone  about  it  and  also  why 
Barnabas  and  not  Peter  was  sent  to  investigate.  Peter  and 
John  (Acts  8)  had  condoned  Philip's  work  in  Samaria  and 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  157 

Peter  was  the  agent  in  the  work  among  the  Romans  in 
Cacsarea.  His  position  was  now  well-known  and  his  services 
discounted  for  this  new  crisis.  These  Greeks  in  Antioch 
were  apparently  in  part  pure  heathen  and  not  "God-fearers" 
like  Cornelius.  A  man  of  wisdom  was  called  for.  These 
preachers  were  themselves  Hellenists  (verse  19)  and  open 
to  the  lessons  from  their  environment  without  a  vision  such 
as  Peter  had  at  Joppa.  "It  was  a  departure  of  startling 
boldness"  (Furneaux)  by  laymen  outside  of  the  circle  of 
official  leaders. 

21 .  The  hand  of  the  Lord  was  zvith  them  {en  cheir  kuriou  met' 
auton).  This  O.T.  phrase  (Ex.  9:3;  Isa.  59:1)  is  used  by  Luke 
(1:66;  Acts  4:28,  30;  13:11).  It  was  proof  of  God's  approval 
of  their  course  in  preaching  the  Lord  Jesus  to  Greeks. 
Turned  unto  the  Lord  {epestrepsen  epi  ton  kurion).  First 
aorist  active  indicative  of  epistrepho,  common  verb  to  turn. 
The  usual  expression  for  Gentiles  turning  to  the  true  God 
(14:15;  15:3,  19;  26:18,  20;  I  Thess.  1:9).  Here  "Lord" 
refers  to  "the  Lord  Jesus"  as  in  verse  20,  though  "the 
hand  of  the  Lord"  is  the  hand  of  Jehovah,  clearly  showing  I 
that  the  early  disciples  put  Jesus  on  a  par  with  Jehovah.  His 
deity  was  not  a  late  development  read  back  into  the  early' 
history. 

22.  Came  to  the  ears  {ekousthe  eis  ta  ota).  First  aorist  pas- 
sive indicative  of  akoud,  was  heard  in  the  ears.  Of  the  church 
which  was  in  Jerusalem  {tes  ekklesias  tes  en  lerousalem). 
Not  yet  was  the  term  "church"  applied  to  the  group  of 
disciples  in  Antioch  as  it  is  in  11 :26  and  13:1.  They  sent  forth 
[exapesteilan).  First  aorist  active  indicative  of  the  double 
compound  verb  ex-apo-stello,  to  send  out  and  away.  The 
choice  of  Barnabas  was  eminently  wise.  He  already  had  a 
position  of  leadership  in  Jerusalem  because  of  his  generosity 
(4:36f.)  and  his  championship  of  Saul  after  his  conversion 
(9:27).  He  was  originally  from  Cyprus  and  probably  had 
personal  friends  among  some  of  the  leaders  in  this  new  move- 


IS8      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

ment.  He  was  to  investigate  the  work  of  the  travelling 
preachers  (verse  19)  all  the  way  to  Antioch  (heds  Anti- 
ocheias). 

23.  The  grace  of  God,  was  glad  {ten  charin  ten  tou  theou 
echare).  Note  repetition  of  the  article,  "the  grace  that  of 
God."  The  verb  (second  aorist  passive  indicative  of  chairo) 
has  the  same  root  as  charis.  See  the  same  suavis  parono- 
masia in  Luke  1:28.  "Grace  brings  gladness"  (Page).  "A 
smaller  man  would  have  raised  difficulties  as  to  circumcision 
or  baptism"  (Furneaux).  He  exhorted  {pare kale i).  Imperfect 
active,  picturing  the  continuous  encouragen^ent  from  Barna- 
bas.^^^2?A_*wr^ojr  of  heart  {tei  prothesei  tes  kardias).  Placing 
before  (from  pro-tithemi),  old  word  for  set  plan  as  in  Acts 
27:13;  Rom.  8:28.  The  glow_of  the  first  enthusiasm  might 
pass  a^  often  ha£2ens_after  a  revival.  Barnabas  had  a  special 
gift  (4:36)  for  work  like  this.  Cleave  unto  the  Lord  {pros- 
menein  [en]  toi  kuridi).  Dative  case  (locative  if  en  is  genuine) 
of  kurios  (here  Jesus  again)  after  prosemenein  to  keep  on^ 
j'emalning  loyal  to  (present  active  infinitive).  Persistence 
was  needed  in  such  a  pagan  city. 

24.  For  {hoti).  Because.  This  is  the  explanation  of  the 
conduct  of  Barnabas.  The  facts  were  opposed  to  the  natural 
prejudices  of  a  Jew  like  Barnabas,  but  he  rose  above  such 
racial  narrowness.  He  was  a  really  good  man  ,iagathos). 
See  Rom.  5:7  for  distinction  between  agathos  a.nd ^dikaios, 
righteous,  where  agathos  ranks  higher  than  dikaios.  Besides, 
Barnabas  was  full  of  the  Holy  Spirit  (like  Peter)  and  of  faith 

--aftd-Si3jyjlling  to  follow  the  leading  of  God^s  SpirTTalYd^Take 
_SQme_risks^  This  is  a  noble  tribute  paid  by  Luke.  One  won- 
ders if  Barnabas  was  still  living  when  he  wrote  this.  Cer- 
tainly he  was  not  prejudiced  against  Barnabas  though  he 
will  follow  the  fortunes  of  Paul  after  the  separation  (15:36- 
41).  Was  added  unto  the  Lord  {prosetethe  toi  kuridi).  First 
aorist  passive  indicative  of  prostithemi,  common  verb  to  add 
to.    These  people  were  added  to  the  Lord  Jesus  before  they 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  159 

were  added  to  the  church.   If  that  were  always  true,  what  a 
difference  it  would  make  in  our  churches. 

25.  To  seek  for  Saul  {anazetesai  Saulon).  First  aorist 
(effective)  active  infinitive  of  purpose.  Anazeteo  is  a  com- 
mon verb  since  Plato,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke 
2^4,  45,  to  seek  up  and  down  {ana),  back  and  forth,  to 
hunt  up,  to  make  a  thorough  search  till  success  comes.  It 
is  plain  from  Gal.  1:21  that  Saul  had  not  been  idle  in  Cilicia. 
Tarsus  was  not  very  far  from  Antioch.  Barnabas  probably 
knew  that  Saul  was  a  vessel  of  choice  (Acts  9:15)  by  Christ 
for  the  work  among  the  Gentiles.  He  knew,  of  course,  of 
Saul's  work  with  the  Hellenists  in  Jerusalem  (9:29)  and 
echoes  of  his  work  in  Cilicia  and  Syria  had  probably  come  to 
him.  So  to  Tarsus  he  goes  when  he  saw  the  need  for  help. 
"He  had  none  of  the  littleness  which  cannot  bear  the  pres- 
ence of  a  possible  rival"  (Furneaux).  Barnabas  knew  his 
own  limitations  and  knew  where  the  man  of  destiny  for  this 
crisis  was,  the  man  who  already  had  the  seal  of  God  upon 
him.  The  hour  and  the  man  met  when  Barnabas  brought 
Saul  to  Antioch.  The  door  was  open  and  the  man  was  ready, 
far  more  ready  than  when  Jesus  called  him  on  the  road  to 
Damascus.  The  years  in  Cilicia  and  Syria  were  not  wasted 
for  they  had  not  been  idle.  If  we  only  knew  the  facts,  it  is 
probable  that  Saul  also  had  been  preaching  to  Hellenes  as 
well  as  to  Hellenists.  Jesus  had  definitely  called  him  to  work 
among  the  Gentiles  (9:15).  In  his  own  way  he  had  come  to 
the  same  place  that  Peter  reached  in  Caesarea  and  that 
Barnabas  now  holds  in  Antioch.  God  always  has  a  man  pre- 
pared for  a  great  emergency  in  the  kingdom.  The  call  of 
Barnabas  was  simply  the  repetition  of  the  call  of  Christ. 
So  Saul  came. 

26.  Even  for  a  whole  year  (kai  eniauton  holon).  Accusa- 
tive of  extent  of  time,  probably  the  year  a.d.  44,  the  year 
preceding  the  visit  to  Jerusalem  (11:30),  the  year  of  the 
famine.    The  preceding  years  with  Tarsus  as  headquarters 


l6o      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

covered  a.d.  37  (39)  to  44.  They  were  gathered  together  with 
the  church  {sunachthenai  en  tei  ekklesidi).  First  aorist  passive 
infinitive  of  sunago,  old  verb,  probably  here  to  meet  together 
as  in  Matt.  28:12.  In  Acts  14:27  the  verb  is  used  of  gathering 
together  the  church,  but  here  en  tei  ekklesidi  excludes  that 
idea.  Barnabas  met  together  "in  the  church"  (note  first  use 
of  the  word  for  the  disciples  at  Antioch).  This  peculiar 
phrase  accents  the  leadership  and  co-operation  of  Barnabas 
and  Saul  in  teaching  (didaxaij  first  aorist  active  infinitive) 
much  people.  Both  infinitives  are  in  the  nominative  case,  the 
subject  of  egeneto  (it  came  to  pass).  And  that  the  disciples 
were  called  Christians  first  in  Antioch  {chrematisai  te  prbtos 
en  Antiocheidi  tous  mathetas  Christianous) .  This  first  active 
infinitive  chrematisai  is  also  a  subject  of  egeneto  and  is  added 
as  a  separate  item  by  the  use  of  te  rather  than  kai.  For  the 
word  itself  in  the  sense  of  divine  command  see  on  Matt.  2:12, 
22;  Luke  2:26;  Acts  10:22.  Here  and  in  Rom.  7:3  it  means 
to  be  called  or  named  (assuming  a  name  from  one's  business, 
chrema,  from  chraomai,  to  use  or  to  do  business).  Polybius 
uses  it  in  this  sense  as  here.  Tous  mathetas  (the  disciples)  is 
in  the  accusative  of  general  reference  with  the  infinitive. 
Christianous  (Christians)  is  simply  predicate  accusative.  This 
word  is  made  after  the  pattern  of  Herodianus  (Matt.  22:16, 
Heroidianoij  followers  of  Herod),  Caesarianus,  a  follower  of 
Caesar  (Deissmann,  Light  from  the  Ancient  East,  p.  377,  gives 
papyri  examples  of  the  genitive  Kaisaros  meaning  also  "be- 
longing to  Caesar"  like  the  common  adjective  Caesarianus). 
It  is  made  thus  like  a  Latin  adjective,  though  it  is  a  Greek 
word,  and  it  refers  to  the  Hebrew  belief  in  a  Messiah  (Page). 
The  name  was  evidently  given  to  the  followers  of  Christ  by 
the  Gentiles  to  distinguish  them  from  the  Jews  since  they 
were  Greeks,  not  Grecian  Jews.  The  Jews  would  not  call 
them  Christians  because  of  their  own  use  of  Christos  the 
Messiah.  The  Jews  termed  them  Galileans  or  Nazarenes. 
The  followers  of  Christ  called  themselves  disciples  (learners). 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  l6l 

believers,  brethren,  saints,  those  of  the  Way.  The  three  uses 
of  Christian  in  the  N.T.  are  from  the  heathen  standpoint 
(here),  Acts  26:28  (a  term  of  contempt  in  the  mouth  of 
Agrippa),  and  I  Peter  4:16  (persecution  from  the  Roman 
government).  It  is  a  clear  distinction  from  both  Jews  and 
Gentiles  and  it  is  not  strange  that  it  came  into  use  first  here 
in  Antioch  when  the  large  Greek  church  gave  occasion  for  it. 
Later  Ignatius  was  bishop  in  Antioch  and  was  given  to  the 
lions  in  Rome,  and  John  Chrysostom  preached  here  his 
wonderful  sermons. 

27.  Prophets  (prophetai).  Christian  prophets  these  were 
(cf.  13:1)  who  came  from  Jerusalem  (the  headquarters, 
8:15).  Judas  and  Silas  are  called  prophets  (14:4;  15:32). 
They  were  not  just  fore-tellers,  but  forth- tellers.  The  prophet 
had  inspiration  and  was  superior  to  the  speaker  with  tongues 
(I  Cor.  14:3).  John  was  a  prophet  (Luke  7:26).  We  need 
prophets  in  the  ministry  today. 

28.  Signified  (esemainen).  Imperfect  active  in  Westcott 
and  Hort,  but  aorist  active  esemdnen  in  the  margin.  The  verb 
is  an  old  one  from  sema  (semeion)  a  sign  (cf.  the  symbolic 
sign  in  2i;ii).  Here  Agabus  (also  in  21:10)  does  predict  a 
famine  through  the  Holy  Spirit.  Should  be  (mellein  esesthai). 
Mello  occurs  either  with  the  present  infinitive  (16:27),  the 
aorist  infinitive  (12:6),  or  the  future  as  here  and  24:15; 
27:10.  Over  all  the  world  (eph'  holen  ten  oikoumenen).  Over 
all  the  inhabited  earth  {gen,  understood).  Probably  a  com- 
mon hyperbole  for  the  Roman  empire  as  in  Luke  2:1.  Jose- 
phus  {Ant.  VIII.  13,  4)  appears  to  restrict  it  to  Palestine. 
In  the  days  of  Claudius  {epi  Klaudiou).  He  was  Roman 
Emperor  a.d.  41-44.  The  Roman  writers  (Suetonius,  Dio 
Cassius,  Tacitus)  all  tell  of  dearths  {assiduae  sterilitates) 
during  the  brief  reign  of  Claudius  who  was  preceded  by 
Caligula  and  followed  by  Nero. 

29.  Every  man  according  to  his  ability  {kathos  euporeito 
tis).  Imperfect  middle  of  euporeo,  to  be  well  off  (from  eu- 


l62      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

poros),  old  verb,  but  here  alone  in  the  N.T.,  "as  any  one 
was  well  off."  The  sentence  is  a  bit  tangled  in  the  Greek 
from  Luke's  rush  of  ideas.  Literally,  "Of  the  disciples,  as 
any  one  was  able  (or  well  off),  they  determined  (horisarif 
marked  off  the  horizon)  each  of  them  to  send  relief  {eis 
diakonian,  for  ministry)  to  the  brethren  who  dwelt  in  Ju- 
daea." The  worst  of  the  famine  came  a.d.  45.  The  warning 
by  Agabus  stirred  the  brethren  in  Antioch  to  send  the  col- 
lection on  ahead. 

30.  Sending  {aposteilantes).  First  aorist  active  participle 
of  apostello,  coincident  action  with  epoiesan  (did).  To  the 
elders  {pros  tons  preshuterous).  The  first  use  of  that  term  for 
the  Christian  preachers.  In  20:17  ^^<^  ^8  "elders"  and 
"bishops"  are  used  interchangeably  as  in  Titus  1:5,  7.  The 
term  probably  arose  gradually  and  holds  a  position  in  the 
church  similar  to  the  same  term  in  the  synagogue.  The 
apostles  were  apparently  absent  from  Jerusalem  at  this 
time  and  they  were  no  longer  concerned  with  serving  tables. 
In  21  :i8  Paul  presented  the  later  collection  also  to  the  elders. 
Since  Peter  and  James  (till  his  death)  were  in  Jerusalem 
during  the  persecution  In  chapter  12  it  is  probable  that  the 
visit  of  Barnabas  and  Saul  to  Jerusalem  came  really  after 
that  persecution  for  Peter  left  Jerusalem  (12:17).  The  elders 
here  mentioned  may  include  the  preachers  in  Judea  also 
outside  of  Jerusalem  (26:20). 


CHAPTER  XII 

I.  About  that  time  {kaf  ekeinon  ton  kairon).  Same  phrase 
in  Rom.  9:9.  That  is,  the  early  part  of  a.d.  44  since  that  is 
the  date  of  Herod's  death.  As  already  suggested,  Barnabas 
and  Saul  came  down  from  Antioch  to  Jerusalem  after  the 
persecution  by  Herod  at  the  end  of  44  or  the  beginning  of 
45.  Herod  the  king  {Her aides  ho  basileus).  Accurate  title  at 
this  particular  time.  Herod  Agrippa  I,  grandson  of  Herod 
the  Great,  was  King  of  Palestine  a.d.  42  to  44;  only  for 
these  three  years  was  a  Herod  king  over  Palestine  since  the 
death  of  Herod  the  Great  and  never  afterwards.  Archelaus 
never  actually  became  king  though  he  had  the  popular  title 
at  first  (Matt.  2:22).  Put  forth  his  hands  {epebalen  tas  chei- 
ras).  Second  aorist  active  indicative  of  epiballo,  old  verb, 
to  cast  upon  or  against.  The  same  idiom  with  tas  cheiras 
(the  hands,  common  Greek  idiom  with  article  rather  than 
possessive  pronoun)  in  4:3  and  5:18.  To  afflict  (kakosai). 
First  aorist  active  infinitive  of  kakoo,  old  word  to  do  harm 
or  evil  to  (kakos),  already  in  7:6,  19.  Outside  of  Acts  in  the 
N.T.  only  I  Peter  5:13.  Infinitive  of  purpose.  Probably 
the  first  who  were  afflicted  were  scourged  or  imprisoned, 
not  put  to  death.  It  had  been  eight  years  or  more  since  the 
persecution  over  the  death  of  Stephen  ceased  with  the 
conversion  of  Saul.  But  the  disciples  were  not  popular  in 
Jerusalem  with  either  Sadducees  or  Pharisees.  The  over- 
tures to  the  Gentiles  in  Caesarea  and  Antioch  may  have 
stirred  up  the  Pharisees  afresh  (cf.  6:14).  Herod  Agrippa 
I  was  an  Idumean  through  his  grandfather  Herod  the  Great 
and  a  grandson  of  Mariamne  the  Maccabean  princess.  He 
was  a  favourite  of  Caligula  the  Roman  Emperor  and  was  anx- 
ious to  placate  his  Jewish  subjects  while  retaining  the  favour 

163 


164      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

of  the  Romans.  So  he  built  theatres  and  held  games  for  the 
Romans  and  Greeks  and  slew  the  Christians  to  please  the 
Jews.  Josephus  {Ant.  XIX.  7,  3)  calls  him  a  pleasant  vain 
man  scrupulously  observing  Jewish  rites.  Here  we  have  for 
the  first  time  political  power  (after  Pilate)  used  against  the 
disciples. 

2.  James  the  brother  of  John  {lakobon  ton  adelphon  Iba- 
7iou).  He  had  been  called  by  Jesus  a  son  of  thunder  along 
with  his  brother  John.  Jesus  had  predicted  a  bloody  death 
for  both  of  them  (Mark  io:38flf.  =  Matt.  20:23).  James  is 
the  first  of  the  apostles  to  die  and  John  probably  the  last. 
He  is  not  James  the  Lord's  brother  (Gal.  i  :I9).  We  do  not 
know  why  Luke  tells  so  little  about  the  death  of  James  and 
so  much  about  the  death  of  Stephen  nor  do  we  know  why 
Herod  selected  him  as  a  victim.  Eusebius  (H.E.  ii.  9)  quotes 
Clement  of  Alexandria  as  saying  that  a  Jew  made  accusa- 
tions against  James  and  was  converted  and  beheaded  at 
the  same  time  with  him.  Killed  with  the  sword  (aneilen 
machairei).  The  verb  is  a  favourite  one  with  Luke  (Acts  2:33; 
5 -339  36;  7:28;  9:23-29;  10:39,  etc.).  Instrumental  case  and 
Ionic  form  of  machaira.  The  Jews  considered  beheading 
a  shameful  death  as  in  the  case  of  the  Baptist  (Matt.  14:10). 

3.  That  it  pleased  the  Jews  {hoti  areston  estin  tois  loudaiois). 
Indirect  assertion  with  the  present  tense  estin  retained. 
Areston  is  the  verbal  adjective  from  ares k 5  followed  by  the 
dative  as  in  John  8:29.  Proceeded  to  seize  (prosetheto  sulla- 
bein).  A  patent  Hebraism  in  Luke  20:1  if.  already,  and 
nowhere  else  in  the  N.T.  It  occurs  in  the  LXX  (Gen.  4:2; 
8:12;  18:29,  etc.).  Second  aorist  middle  indicative  of  prosii- 
themi  and  the  second  aorist  active  infimtive  of  sullambanb. 
Literally,  he  added  to  seize,  he  seized  Peter  in  addition  to 
James.  The  days  of  unleavened  bread  {hemerai  ton  azumon). 
By  this  parenthesis  Luke  locates  the  time  of  the  year  when 
Peter  was  arrested,  the  passover.  It  was  a  fine  occasion 
for  Agrippa  to  increase  his  favour  among  the  crowds  of  Jews 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  165 

there  by  extra  zeal  against  the  Christians.  It  is  possible 
that  Luke  obtained  his  information  about  this  incident 
from  John  Mark  for  at  his  Mother's  house  the  disciples 
gathered  (12:12). 

4.  When  he  had  taken  him  (piasas).  See  on  3:7  for  same 
form.  He  put  him  in  prison  {etheto  eis  phulaken).  Second 
aorist  middle  indicative  of  tithemi,  common  verb.  This  is  the 
third  imprisonment  of  Peter  (4:3;  5:18).  To  four  quaternions 
of  soldiers  (tessarsin  tetradiois  stratioton).  Four  soldiers  in 
each  quaternion  (ietradion  from  tetras,  four),  two  on  the  in- 
side with  the  prisoner  (chained  to  him)  and  two  on  the  out- 
side, in  shifts  of  six  hours  each,  sixteen  soldiers  in  all,  the 
usual  Roman  custom.  Probably  Agrippa  had  heard  of  Peter's 
previous  escape  (5:19)  and  so  took  no  chances  for  conniv- 
ance of  the  jailors,  ^fter  the  passover  (meta  to  pascha).  The 
passover  feast  of  eight  days.  "The  stricter  Jews  regarded 
it  as  a  profanation  to  put  a  person  to  death  during  a  re- 
ligious festival"  (Hackett).  So  Agrippa  is  more  scrupulous 
than  the  Sanhedrin  was  about  Jesus.  To  bring  him  forth 
{anagagein  auton).  Second  aorist  active  infinitive  of  anago, 
to  lead  up,  old  verb,  used  literally  here.  Peter  was  in  the 
inner  prison  or  lower  ward  and  so  would  be  led  up  to  the 
judgment  seat  where  Herod  Agrippa  would  sit  (cf.  John 
19:13).  To  the  people  {toi  laoi).  Ethical  dative,  in  the  pres- 
ence of  and  for  the  pleasure  of  the  Jewish  people. 

5.  Therefore  {men  oun).  Because  of  the  preceding  situa- 
tion. Was  kept  (etereito).  Imperfect  passive,  continuously 
guarded,  waiting  for  the  feast  to  be  over.  But  prayer  was 
made  earnestly  {proseuche  de  en  ektenos  ginomene).  Prob- 
ably de  here  is  not  adversative  (but),  merely  parallel  {and) 
as  Page  argues.  It  was  a  crisis  for  the  Jerusalem  church. 
James  had  been  slain  and  Peter  was  to  be  the  next  victim. 
Hence  "earnestly"  (late  adverb  from  ektenes,  strained,  from 
ekteinb,  to  stretch.  In  the  N.T.  only  here,  Luke  22:44; 
I  Peter  i  :22)  prayer  was  going  up  {ginomene,  present  middle 


l66     WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

participle,  periphrastic  imperfect  with  en).  It  looked  like 
a  desperate  case  for  Peter.  Hence  the  disciples  prayed  the 
more  earnestly. 

6.  JVas  about  to  bring  him  forth  {emellen  prosagagein  or 
proagagein).  The  MSS.  vary,  but  not  anagagein  of  verse  4. 
The  same  night  (tei  nukti  ekeinei).  Locative  case,  on  that 
(very)  night.  Was  sleeping  {en  koimomenos).  Periphrastic 
middle  imperfect.  Bound  with  two  chains  {dedemenos  haluse- 
sin  dusin).  Perfect  passive  participle  of  deo,  to  bind,  followed 
by  instrumental  case.  One  chain  was  fastened  to  each 
soldier  (one  on  each  side  of  Peter).  Kept  (eteroun).  Im- 
perfect active,  were  keeping.  Two  guards  outside  before 
the  door  and  two  inside,  according  to  Roman  rule.  Did 
Peter  recall  the  prophecy  of  Jesus  that  he  should  be  put  to 
death  in  his  old  age  (John  21:18).''  Jesus  had  not  said,  as 
Furneaux  does,  that  he  would  die  by  crucifixion. 

7.  Stood  by  him  (epeste).  Ingressive  second  aorist  active 
indicative  of  ephistemi,  intransitive.  This  very  form  occurs 
in  Luke  2:9  of  the  sudden  appearance  of  the  angel  of  the 
Lord  to  the  shepherds.  Page  notes  that  this  second  aorist 
of  ephistemi  occurs  seven  times  in  the  Gospel  of  Luke,  eight 
times  in  the  Acts,  and  nowhere  else  in  the  N.T.  Note  also 
the  same  form  apeste  (departed  from,  from  aphistemi^  stood 
oflF  from)  of  the  disappearance  of  the  angel  in  verse  10. 
In  the  cell  {en  toi  oikemati).  Literally,  a  dwelling  place  or 
habitation  (from  oikeo,  to  dwell,  oikos,  house),  but  here  not 
the  prison  as  a  whole  as  in  Thucydides,  but  the  room  in  the 
prison  (cell)  where  Peter  was  chained  to  the  two  guards. 
Old  word,  but  only  here  in  the  N.T.  He  smote  Peter  on  the 
side  {pataxas  ten  pleuran  tou  Petrou).  More  exactly,  "smote 
the  side  of  Peter."  Strongly  enough  to  wake  Peter  up  who 
was  sound  asleep  and  yet  not  rouse  the  two  guards.  It 
was  probably  between  3  a.m.  and  6  a.m.,  hours  when  changes 
in  the  guards  were  made.  Rise  up  {anasta).  Short  form 
{Koine)    of   anastethi,    second    aorist    active    imperative   of 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  167 

anistemif  intransitive.  So  also  Acts  9:11  (Westcott  and  Hort 
text);  Eph.  5:14.  Fell  off  (exepesan).  Second  aorist  active 
with  a  ending  like  first  aorist  of  expipto,  old  verb.  This 
miracle  was  necessary  if  Peter  was  to  escape  without  rousing 
the  two  guards. 

8.  Gird  thyself  (zosai).  Direct  middle  first  aorist  (ingres- 
sive)  imperative  (Robertson,  Grammar^  pp.  8o6f.)  from 
zonnumi  (zonnuo).  Old  verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and 
John  21:18  (twice  to  Peter)  where  the  active  voice  and  the 
reflexive  pronoun  occur  in  the  first  example.  The  girdle 
was  worn  round  the  chiton  or  undergarment.  Bind  on  (hupo- 
desai).  Indirect  middle  (by  yourself  or  for  yourself)  first 
aorist  imperative  of  hupodeOj  to  bind  under,  old  verb,  only 
three  times  in  the  N.T.  [Mark  6:9;  Acts  12:8;  Eph.  6:15 
(middle)].  Sandals  (sandalia).  Persian  word  common  from 
Herodotus  on,  a  sole  made  of  wood  or  leather  covering  the 
bottom  of  the  foot  and  bound  on  with  thongs.  In  the  N.T. 
only  here  and  Mark  6:9.  In  the  LXX  used  indiscriminately 
with  hupodema.  Cast  about  thee  (peribalou).  Second  aorist 
middle  (indirect)  imperative  of  periballo,  old  and  common 
verb  to  throw  around,  especially  clothing  around  the  body 
as  here.  The  himation  (outer  garment)  was  put  over  the 
chiton.  It  was  not  a  hurried  flight.  Follow  me  {akolouthei 
mot).  Present  (linear)  active  imperative,  keep  on  following 
me   (associative  instrumental  case). 

9.  Wist  not  {ouk  eidei).  Past  perfect  of  oida  used  as  Im- 
perfect, did  not  know.  Followed  (ekolouthei).  Imperfect 
active,  kept  on  following  as  the  angel  had  directed  (verse 
8).  That  it  was  true  (hoti  alethes  estin).  Indirect  assertion 
and  so  present  tense  retained.  Note  "true"  (alethes)  In  the 
sense  of  reality  or  actuality.  Which  was  done  {to  ginomenon). 
Present  middle  participle,  that  which  was  happening. 
Thought  he  saw  a  vision  {edokei  horama  blepein).  Imperfect 
active,  kept  on  thinking,  puzzled  as  he  was.  Blepein  Is  the 
infinitive  in  indirect  assertion  without  the  pronoun   (he)

expressed  which  could  be  either  nominative  in  apposition 
with  the  subject  as  in  Rom,  i  :22  or  accusative  of  gen- 
eral reference  as  in  Acts  5:36;  8:9  (Robertson,  Grammar, 
pp.  1036-40).  Peter  had  had  a  vision  in  Joppa  (10:10)  which 
Luke  describes  as  an  "ecstasy,"  but  here  is  objective  fact, 
at  least  Luke  thought  so  and  makes  that  distinction.  Peter 
will  soon  know  whether  he  is  still  in  the  cell  or  not  as  we  find 
out  that  a  dream  is  only  a  dream  when  we  wake  up. 

10.  fVhen  they  were  past  (dielthontes).  Second  aorist  active 
participle  of  dierchomai,  transitive  with  dia  in  composition. 
The  first  and  the  second  ward  {prbten  phulaken  kai  deuteran). 
It  is  not  clear  to  what  this  language  refers.  Some  take  it  to 
mean  single  soldiers,  using  phulaken  in  the  sense  of  a  guard 
(one  before  the  door,  one  at  the  iron  gate).  But  it  seems 
hardly  likely  that  the  two  soldiers  with  whom  Peter  had  been 
stationed  are  meant.  Probably  the  "first  ward"  means  the 
two  soldiers  of  the  quaternion  stationed  by  the  door  and 
the  second  ward  some  other  soldiers,  not  part  of  the  sixteen, 
further  on  in  the  prison  by  the  iron  gate.  However  under- 
stood, the  difficulties  of  escape  are  made  plain.  Unto  the  iron 
gate  that  leadeth  into  the  city  {epi  ten  pulen  ten  siderdn  ten 
pherousan  eis  ten  polin).  Note  the  triple  use  of  the  article 
(the  gate  the  iron  one  the  one  leading  into  the  city).  For 
this  resumptive  use  of  the  article  see  Robertson,  Grammar, 
pp.  762,  764.  This  iron  gate  may  have  opened  from  a  court 
out  into  the  street  and  efi"ectually  barred  escape.  Opened  to 
them  (enoige  autois).  Second  aorist  passive  indicative  of 
anoigb,  the  usual  later  form  though  enoichthe  (first  aorist 
passive)  occurs  also,  was  opened.  Of  its  own  accord  {auto- 
mate).  Old  compound  adjective  {autos,  self,  obsolete  mao,  to 
desire  eagerly,  feminine  form  though  masculine  automates 
also  used  as  feminine).  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Mark 
4:28.  It  was  a  strange  experience  for  Peter.  The  Codex  Bezae 
adds  here  "went  down  the  seven  steps"  (katebesav  tous 
hepta   bathmous),    an   interesting   detail    that   adds    to   the 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  169 

picture.  One  street  (rhumen  mian).  The  angel  saw  Peter 
through  one  of  the  narrow  streets  and  then  left  him.  We  have 
no  means  of  knowing  precisely  the  location  of  the  prison 
in  the  city.   On  "departed"  (apeste)  see  on  verse  7. 

11.  Was  come  to  himself  {en  heautoi  genomenos).  Second 
aorist  middle  participle  of  ginomai  with  en  and  the  locative 
case,  "becoming  at  himself."  In  Luke  15:17  we  have  eis 
heauton  elthon  (coming  to  himself,  as  if  he  had  been  on  a  trip 
away  from  himself).  Now  I  know  of  a  truth  {nun  oida  alethos). 
There  was  no  further  confusion  of  mind  that  it  was  an  ecstasy 
as  in  10:10.  But  he  was  in  peril  for  the  soldiers  would  soon 
learn  of  his  escape,  when  the  change  of  guards  came  at  6  a.m. 
Delivered  me  {exeilato  me).  Second  aorist  middle  indicative 
of  exaireo.  The  Lord  rescued  me  of  himself  by  his  angel. 
Expectation  {prosdokias).  Old  word  from  prosdokao,  to  look 
for.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  21 126.  James  had  been 
put  to  death  and  the  Jewish  people  were  eagerly  waiting 
for  the  execution  of  Peter  like  hungry  wolves. 

12.  When  he  had  considered  {sunidon).  Second  aorist  ac- 
tive participle  of  suneidon  (for  the  defective  verb  sunorad), 
to  see  together,  to  grasp  as  a  whole,  old  verb,  but  in  the  N.T. 
only  here  and  14:6,  save  the  perfect  indicative  sunoida  (I 
Gor.  4:4)  and  participle  (Acts  5 :2).  It  is  the  word  from  which 
suneidesis  (conscience)  comes  (Rom.  2:15).  Peter's  mind 
worked  rapidly  and  he  decided  what  to  do.  He  took  in  his 
situation  clearly.  To  the  house  of  Mary  {epi  ten  oikian  tes 
Marias).  Another  Mary  (the  others  were  Mary  the  mother 
of  Jesus,  Mary  of  Bethany,  Mary  Magdalene,  Mary  wife 
of  Cleopas,  Mary  the  mother  of  James  and  Joses).  She  may 
have  been  a  widow  and  was  possessed  of  some  means  since 
her  house  was  large  enough  to  hold  the  large  group  of  dis- 
ciples there.  Barnabas,  cousin  of  John  Mark  her  son  (Col. 
4:10),  was  also  a  man  of  property  or  had  been  (Acts  4:36^). 
It  is  probable  that  the  disciples  had  been  in  the  habit  of 
meeting  in  her  house,  a  fact  known  to  Peter  and  he  was 


I70     WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

evidently  fond  of  John  Mark  whom  he  afterwards  calls 
*'my  son"  (I  Peter  5:13)  and  whom  he  had  met  here.  The 
upper  room  of  Acts  1:13  may  have  been  in  Mary's  house 
and  Mark  may  have  been  the  man  bearing  a  pitcher  of  water 
(Luke  22:10)  and  the  young  man  who  fled  in  the  Garden  of 
Gethsemane  (Mark  14 15  if.).  There  was  a  gate  and  portress 
here  as  in  the  house  of  the  highpriest  (John  18:16).  Peter 
knew  where  to  go  and  even  at  this  early  hour  hoped  to  find 
some  of  the  disciples.  Mary  is  one  of  the  many  mothers  who 
have  become  famous  by  reason  of  their  sons,  though  she 
was  undoubtedly  a  woman  of  high  character  herself.  Were 
gathered  together  and  were  praying  {esan  sunethroismenoi  kai 
proseuchomenoi).  Note  difference  in  the  tenses,  one  peri- 
phrastic past  perfect  passive  {sunathroizo  old  verb,  in  the 
N.T.  here  only  and  19:25  and  the  uncompounded  throizo 
in  Luke  24:33)  and  the  periphrastic  imperfect.  The  praying 
apparently  had  been  going  on  all  night  and  a  large  number 
(many,  hikanoi)  of  the  disciples  were  there.  One  recalls 
the  time  when  they  had  gathered  to  pray  (4:31)  after  Peter 
had  told  the  disciples  of  the  threats  of  the  Sanhedrin  (4:23). 
God  had  rescued  Peter  then.  Would  he  let  him  be  put  to 
death  now  as  James  had  been? 

13.  When  he  knocked  at  the  door  of  the  gate  (krousantos 
autou  ten  thuran  tou  pulonos).  Genitive  absolute  with  aorist 
active  participle  of  kroud,  common  verb  to  knock  or  knock 
at.  So  from  the  outside  (Luke  13 :25).  Pulon  here  is  the  gate- 
way or  passageway  from  the  door  (thura)  that  leads  to  the 
house.  Inverse  14  it  is  still  the  passageway  without  the  use  of 
thura  (door,  so  for  both  door  and  passageway).  To  answer 
{hupakousai).  To  listen  under  before  opening.  First  aorist 
active  infinitive  of  hupakouo,  common  verb  to  obey,  to 
hearken.  J  maid  (paidiske).  Portress  as  in  John  18:17.  A 
diminutive  of  paisy  a  female  slave  (so  on  an  ostracon  of 
second  century  a.d.,  Deissmann,  Light  from  the  Ancient 
Easty  p.  200).   Rhoda.  A  rose.  Women  can  have  such  beauti-

ful  names  like  Dorcas  (Gazelle),  Euodia  (Sweet  Aroma), 
Syntyche  (Good  Luck).  Mark  or  Peter  could  tell  Luke  her 
name. 

14.  When  she  knew  (epignousa).  Second  aorist  (ingresslve) 
active  participle  of  epiginosko,  to  know  fully  or  in  addition 
(epi),  to  recognize.  She  knew  Peter  and  his  voice  from  his 
frequent  visits  there.  For  joy  {apo  tes  chards).  From  her  joy 
(ablative  case),  life-like  picture  of  the  maid  who  left  Peter 
standing  outside  with  the  door  to  the  passageway  unopened. 
Note  the  aorist  tenses  for  quick  action  {ouk  enoixen)^  eis- 
dramousa  (from  eistrecho,  defective  verb,  only  here  in  the 
N.T.),  apeggeilen.  Stood  {hesianai).  Second  perfect  active 
infinitive  of  Aii^^wz", -intransitive,  in  indirect  assertion  with 
ton  Petron  (Peter)  accusative  of  general  reference.  The  slave 
girl  acted  as  if  she  were  a  member  of  the  family  (Furneaux), 
but  she  left  Peter  in  peril. 

15.  Thou  art  mad  (mainei).  Present  middle  indicative 
second  person  singular.  Old  verb,  only  in  the  middle  voice. 
Festus  used  the  same  word  to  Paul  (26:24).  The  maid  was 
undoubtedly  excited,  but  it  was  a  curious  rebuff  from  those 
who  had  been  praying  all  night  for  Peter's  release.  In  their 
defence  it  may  be  said  that  Stephen  and  James  had  been 
put  to  death  and  many  others  by  Saul's  persecution.  She 
confidently  affirmed  {diischurizeto).  Imperfect  middle  of 
diischurizomaij  an  old  word  of  vigorous  and  confident  asser- 
tion, originally  to  lean  upon.  Only  here  in  the  N.T.  The  girl 
stuck  to  her  statement.  It  is  his  angel  {Ho  aggelos  estin  autou). 
This  was  the  second  alternative  of  the  disciples.  It  was  a 
popular  Jewish  belief  that  each  man  had  a  guardian  angel. 
Luke  takes  no  position  about  it.  No  scripture  teaches  it. 

16.  Continued  knocking  {epemenen  krouon).  Imperfect 
active  and  present  participle.  Now  all  heard  the  knocking. 
When  they  had  opened  (anoixantes).  First  aorist  active 
participle  of  anoigo  or  -numi.  The  whole  group  rushed  out 
to  the  courtyard  this  time  to  make  sure.    They  were  amazed

(exestesan) .   The  frequent  second  aorist  active  (intransitive) 
indicative  of  exist enii. 

17.  There  were  probably  loud  exclamations  of  astonish- 
ment and  joy.  Beckoning  with  the  hand  {kataseisas  tei  cheiri). 
First  aorist  active  participle  of  kataseio,  old  verb  to  signal 
or  shake  down  with  the  hand  (instrumental  case  cheiri). 
In  the  N.T.  only  in  Acts  12:17;  13:16;  19:33;  21:40.  The 
speaker  indicates  by  a  downward  movement  of  the  hand 
his  desire  for  silence  (to  hold  their  peace,  sigdin,  present 
active  infinitive,  to  keep  silent).  Peter  was  anxious  for  every 
precaution  and  he  wanted  their  instant  attention.  Declared 
{diegesato).  F-irst  aorist  middle  of  diegeomai,  old  verb  to 
carry  through  a  narrative,  give  a  full  story.  See  also  Acts 
9:27  of  Barnabas  in  his  defence  of  Saul.  Peter  told  them  the 
wonderful  story.  Unto  James  and  the  brethren  {lakoboi  kai 
tois  adelphois).  Dative  case  after  apaggeilate  (first  aorist 
active  imperative).  Evidently  "James  and  the  brethren" 
were  not  at  this  meeting,  probably  meeting  elsewhere.  There 
was  no  place  where  all  the  thousands  of  disciples  in  Jeru- 
salem could  meet.  This  gathering  in  the  house  of  Mary  may 
have  been  of  women  only  or  a  meeting  of  the  Hellenists,  It  is 
plain  that  this  James  the  Lord's  brother,  is  now  the  leading 
presbyter  or  elder  in  Jerusalem  though  there  were  a  number 
(11:30;  21:18).  Paul  even  terms  him  apostle  (Gal.  1:19), 
though  certainly  not  one  of  the  twelve.  The  twelve  apostles 
probably  were  engaged  elsewhere  in  mission  work  save  James 
now  dead  (Acts  12:2)  and  Peter.  The  leadership  of  James  is 
here  recognized  by  Peter  and  is  due,  partly  to  the  absence  of 
the  twelve,  but  mainly  to  his  own  force  of  character.  He  will 
preside  over  the  Jerusalem  Conference  (Acts  15:13),  To 
another  place  {eis  heteron  topon).  Probably  Luke  did  not 
know  the  place  and  certainly  It  was  prudent  for  Peter  to 
conceal  it  from  Herod  Agrippa.  Probably  Peter  left  the 
city.  He  is  back  in  Jerusalem  at  the  Conference  a  few  years 
later  (Acts   15:7)   and  after  the  death  of  Herod  Agrippa. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  173 

Whether  Peter  went  to  Rome  during  these  years  we  do  not 
know.  He  was  recognized  later  as  the  apostle  to  the  cir- 
cumcision (Gal.  2:7;  I  Peter  i:i)  and  apparently  was  in 
Rome  with  John  Mark  when  he  wrote  the  First  Epistle 
(I  Peter  5:13),  unless  it  is  the  real  Babylon.  But,  even  if 
Peter  went  to  Rome  during  this  early  period,  there  is  no  evi- 
dence that  he  founded  the  church  there.  If  he  had  done  so, 
in  the  light  of  H  Cor.  10:16  it  would  be  strange  that  Paul 
had  not  mentioned  it  in  writing  to  Rome,  for  he  was  anxious 
not  to  build  on  another  man's  foundation  (Rom.  15:20). 
Paul  felt  sure  that  he  himself  had  a  work  to  do  in  Rome. 
Unfortunately  Luke  has  not  followed  the  ministry  of  Peter 
after  this  period  as  he  does  Paul  (appearing  again  only  in 
chapter  15).  If  Peter  really  left  Jerusalem  at  this  time  in- 
stead of  hiding  in  the  city,  he  probably  did  some  mission 
work  as  Paul  says  that  he  did  (I  Cor.  9:5). 

18.  As  soon  as  it  was  day  {Genomenes  hemeras).  Genitive 
absolute,  day  having  come.  No  small  stir  (tarachos  ouk 
oligos).  Litotes  {ouk  oligos),  occurs  eight  times  in  the  Acts 
as  in  15:2,  and  nowhere  else  in  the  N.T.  Tarachos  (stir)  is 
an  old  word  from  tarasso,  to  agitate.  In  the  N.T  only  here 
and  19:23.  Probably  all  sixteen  soldiers  were  agitated  over 
this  remarkable  escape.  They  were  responsible  for  the  pris- 
oner with  their  lives  (cf.  Acts  16:27;  27:42).  Furneaux  sug- 
gests that  Manaen,  the  king's  foster-brother  and  a  Chris- 
tian (13:1),  was  the  "angel"  who  rescued  Peter  from  the 
prison.  That  is  not  the  way  that  Peter  looked  at  it.  fVhat 
was  become  of  Peter  {ti  ara  ho  Petros  egeneto).  An  indirect 
question  with  the  aorist  indicative  retained.  Ara  adds  a 
syllogism  (therefore)  to  the  problem  as  in  Luke  1:66.  The 
use  of  the  neuter  ti  (as  in  Acts  13:25)  is  different  from  tis, 
though  nominative  like  Petros,  literally,  "what  then  Peter 
had  become,"  "what  had  happened  to  Peter"  (in  one  id- 
iom). See  the  same  idiom  in  John  21:21  {houtos  de  ti).  But 
this  one  what  (verb  genesetai  not  used).

19.  He  examined  (anakrinas).  First  aorist  active  partici- 
ple of  anakrino,  old  verb  to  sift  up  and  down,  to  question 
thoroughly,  in  a  forensic  sense  (Luke  23:14;  Acts  4:9;  12:19; 
28:18).  That  they  should  he  put  to  death  (apachthenai).  First 
aorist  passive  infinitive  (indirect  command)  of  apago,  old 
verb  to  lead  away,  especially  to  execution  as  in  Matt,  27: 
31.  Here  it  is  used  absolutely.  This  was  the  ordinary  Ro- 
man routine  and  not  a  proof  of  special  cruelty  on  the  part 
of  Herod  Agrippa.  Tarried  (dietriben).  Imperfect  active. 
Herod  Agrippa  made  his  home  in  Jerusalem,  but  he  went  to 
Caesarea  to  the  public  games  in  honour  of  Emperor  Claudius. 

20.  Was  highly  displeased  {en  thumomachon).  Periphras- 
tic imperfect  active  of  thumomacheo,  late  compound  of 
thumos  (passionate  heat)  and  machomai,  to  fight.  Only  here 
in  the  N.T.,  to  fight  desperately,  to  have  a  hot  quarrel. 
Whether  it  was  open  war  with  the  Phoenicians  or  just 
violent  hostility  we  do  not  know,  save  that  Phoenicia  be- 
longed to  Syria  and  Herod  Agrippa  had  no  authority  there. 
The  quarrel  may  have  been  over  commercial  matters.  They 
came  with  one  accord  (homothumadon  paresan).  The  repre- 
sentatives of  Tyre  and  SIdon.  See  on  i  :i4  for  homothumadon. 
Tyre  was  a  colony  of  SIdon  and  had  become  one  of  the  chief 
commercial  cities  of  the  world  by  reason  of  the  Phoenician 
ships.  The  king's  chamberlain  {ton  epi  tou  koitonos  tou  basi- 
leos).  The  one  over  the  bedchamber  {koitonos^  late  word 
from  koite,  bed,  here  only  in  the  N.T.).  Made  their  friend 
(peisantes).  First  aorist  active  participle  of  peitho,  to  per- 
suade. Having  persuaded  (probably  with  bribes  as  in  Matt. 
28:14).  They  asked  for  peace  {eitounto  eirenen).  Imperfect 
middle  of  aiteo^  kept  on  asking  for  peace.  Because  their 
country  was  fed  {dia  to  trephesthai  auton  ten  choran).  Causal 
sentence  with  dia  and  the  articular  Infinitive  (present  pas- 
sive of  trephd,  to  nourish  or  feed)  and  the  accusative  of  gen- 
eral reference,  "because  of  the  being  fed  as  to  their  coun- 
try." Tyre  and  SIdon  as  large  commercial  cities  on  the  coast

received  large  supplies  of  grain  and  fruits  from  Palestine. 
Herod  had  cut  off  the  supplies  and  that  brought  the  two 
cities  to  action. 

21.  Upon  a  set  day  {taktei  hemerdi).  Locative  case  and 
the  verbal  adjective  of  tasso,  to  arrange,  appoint,  old  word, 
here  only  in  the  N.T.  Josephus  {Ant.  XVIL  6,  8;  XIX.  8,  2) 
gives  a  full  account  of  the  occasion  and  the  death  of  Herod 
Agrippa.  It  was  the  second  day  of  the  festival  in  honour  of 
the  Emperor  Claudius,  possibly  his  birthday  rather  than 
the  Quinquennalia.  The  two  accounts  of  Luke  and  Josephus 
supplement  each  other  with  no  contradiction.  Josephus 
does  not  mention  the  name  of  Blastus.  Arrayed  himself  in 
royal  apparel  {endusamenos  estheta  basiliken).  First  aorist 
middle  (indirect)  participle  of  enduno  or  enduo,  common 
verb  to  put  on.  Literally,  having  put  royal  apparel  on  him- 
self (a  robe  of  silver  tissue,  Josephus  says).  The  rays  of  the 
sun  shone  on  this  brilliant  apparel  and  the  vast  crowd  in 
the  open  amphitheatre  became  excited  as  Herod  began  to 
speak.  Made  an  oration  (edemegorei).  Imperfect  active  of 
demegoreb,  old  verb  from  demegoros  (haranguer  of  the  peo- 
ple), and  that  from  demos  (people)  and  agoreuo,  to  harangue 
or  address  the  people.   Only  here  in  the  N.T.  He  kept  it  up. 

22.  Shouted  (epephonei).  Imperfect  active,  kept  on  shout- 
ing, calling  out  to  him.  Old  verb,  but  only  four  times  in  the 
N.T.  and  all  by  Luke.  The  heathen  crowd  (demos)  repeated 
their  flattering  adulation  to  gain  Herod's  favour.  The  voice 
of  a  god  {theou  phone).  In  the  pagan  sense  of  emperor  wor- 
ship, not  as  the  Supreme  Being.  But  it  was  pleasing  to 
Herod  Agrippa's  vanity. 

23.  Smote  him  (epataxen  auton).  Effective  aorist  active  in- 
dicative of  patasso,  old  verb,  used  already  in  verse  7  of  gentle 
smiting  of  the  angel  of  the  Lord,  here  of  a  severe  stroke  of 
affliction.  Like  Nebuchadnezzar  (Dan.  4:30)  pride  went 
before  a  fall.  He  was  struck  down  in  the  very  zenith  of  his 
glory.     Because  {anth^  hon).    Anti  with  the  genitive  of  the

relative  pronoun,  "in  return  for  which  things."  He  accepted 
the  impious  flattery  (Hackett)  instead  of  giving  God  the 
glory.  He  was  a  nominal  Jew,  He  was  eaten  of  worms  {geno- 
menos  skolekobrotos).  Ingressive  aorist  middle  participle, 
"becoming  worm-eaten."  The  compound  verbal  adjective 
(skolex,  worm,  brotos,  eaten,  from  bibrosko)  is  a  late  word 
(II  Mace.  9:9)  of  the  death  of  Antiochus  Epiphanes,  used 
also  of  a  tree  (Theophrastus),  here  only  in  the  N.T.  The 
word  skblex  was  used  of  intestinal  worms  and  Herodotus  (IV. 
205)  describes  Pheretima,  Queen  of  Cyrene,  as  having 
swarms  of  worms  which  ate  her  flesh  while  still  alive.  Jose- 
phus  {Ant.  XIX.  8,  2)  says  that  Herod  Agrippa  lingered 
for  five  days  and  says  that  the  rotting  of  his  flesh  produced 
worms,  an  item  in  harmony  with  the  narrative  in  Luke. 
Josephus  gives  further  details,  one  a  superstitious  sight  of  an 
owl  sitting  on  one  of  the  ropes  of  the  awning  of  the  theatre 
while  the  people  flattered  him,  an  omen  of  his  death  to  him. 
Luke  puts  it  simply  that  God  smote  him.  Gave  up  the  ghost 
{exepsuxen).  Eff"ective  aorist  active  of  ekpsucho,  to  breathe 
out,  late  verb,  medical  term  in  Hippocrates,  in  the  N.T. 
only  in  Acts  5:5,  10;  12:23.  Herod  was  carried  out  of  the 
theatre  a  dying  man  and  lingered  only  five  days. 

24.  Grew  and  multiplied  (euxanen  kai  eplethuneto).  Imper- 
fect active  and  passive.  Cf.  6:1.  The  reaction  from  the 
death  of  James  and  the  imprisonment  of  Peter. 

25.  From  Jerusalem  {ex  lerousalem).  Probably  correct 
text,  though  D  has  apo.  Westcott  and  Hort  follow  Aieph  B 
in  reading  eis  {to)  Jerusalem,  an  impossible  reading  contra- 
dicted by  ii:29f.  and  13:1.  The  ministration  {diakonian) 
referred  to  is  that  in  ii:29f.  which  may  have  taken  place, 
in  point  of  time,  after  the  death  of  Herod.  Taking  with  them 
{sunparalabontes).  Taking  along  {para)  with  {sun)  them, 
John  Mark  from  Jerusalem  (12:12)  to  Antioch  (13:1).  The 
aorist  participle  does  not  express  subsequent  action  as  Rack- 
ham  here  argues  (Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  861-863). 


CHAPTER  XIII 

1.  In  the  church  that  was  there  (kata  ten  ousan  ekklesian). 
Possibly  distributed  throughout  the  church  (note  "in  the 
church"  11:26).  Now  a  strong  organization  there.  Luke 
here  begins  the  second  part  of  Acts  with  Antioch  as  the  cen- 
tre of  operations,  no  longer  Jerusalem.  Paul  is  now  the  cen- 
tral figure  instead  of  Peter.  Jerusalem  had  hesitated  too 
long  to  carry  out  the  command  of  Jesus  to  take  the  gospel 
to  the  whole  world.  That  glory  will  now  belong  to  Antioch. 
Prophets  and  teachers  (prophetai  kai  didaskaloi).  All  prophets 
were  teachers,  but  not  all  teachers  were  prophets  who  were 
for-speakers  of  God,  sometimes  fore-speakers  like  Agabus 
in  1 1 :28.  The  double  use  of  te  here  makes  three  prophets 
(Barnabas,  Symeon,  Lucius)  and  two  teachers  (Manaen 
and  Saul).  Barnabas  heads  the  list  (11:22)  and  Saul  comes 
last.  Symeon  Niger  may  be  the  Simon  of  Cyrene  who 
carried  the  Saviour's  cross.  Lucius  of  Cyrene  was  probably 
one  of  the  original  evangelists  (11:20).  The  name  is  one 
of  the  forms  of  Luke,  but  it  is  certainly  not  Luke  the  Physi- 
cian. Manaen  shows  how  the  gospel  was  reaching  some  of 
the  higher  classes  (home  of  Herod  Antipas).  Foster-brother 
(suntrophos).  Old  word  for  nourished  with  or  brought 
up  with  one  collactaneus  (Vulgate).  These  are  clearly  the  out- 
standing men  in  the  great  Greek  church  in  Antioch. 

2,  As  they  ministered  to  the  Lord  {leitourgounton  auton  tot 
kurioi).  Genitive  absolute  of  leitourgeo,  old  verb,  used  of 
the  Attic  orators  who  served  the  state  at  their  own  cost 
{leos  or  laos,  people,  and  ergon,  work  or  service).  Common  in 
the  LXX  of  the  priests  who  served  in  the  tabernacle  (Ex. 
28:31,  39)  like  leitourgia  (Luke  1:23)  which  see.  So  in  Heb. 
10:11.    In  Rom.  15:27  of  aiding  others  in  poverty.   Here  of

worship  (prayer,  exhortation,  fasting).     The  word  liturgy 
grows  out  of  this  use.  And  fasted  (kai  nesteuontbn).  Genitive 
absolute  also.    Christian  Jews  were  keeping  up  the  Jewish 
fast  (Luke  18:12).    Note  fasting  also  in  the  choice  of  elders 
for  the  Mission  Churches  (Acts   14:23).     Fasting  was  not 
obligatory  on  the  Christians,  but  they  were  facing  a  great 
emergency  in  giving  the  gospel  to  the  Gentile  world.  Separate 
me  {aphorisate  de  mot).     First  aorist  active  imperative  of 
aphorizo,  old  verb  to  mark  off  boundaries  or  horizon,  used 
by  Paul  of  his  call  (Rom.  i:i;  Gal.  1:15).  The  Greek  has  de^ 
a   shortened   form  of  ede  and  like  Latin  jam  and  German 
dock,  now  therefore.   It  ought  to  be  preserved  in  the  transla- 
tion.   Cf.  Luke  2:15;  Acts  15:36;  I  Cor.  6:20.    Moi  is  the 
ethical  dative.  As  in  verse  i  Barnabas  is  named  before  Saul. 
Both  had  been  called  to  ministry  long  ago,  but  now  this 
call  is  to  the  special  campaign  among  the  Gentiles.     Both 
had  been  active  and  useful  in  such  work.    Whereunto  {ho). 
Here  eis  has  to  be  repeated  from  eis  to  ergon  just  before,  "for 
which"  as  Jesus  sent  the  twelve  and  the  seventy  in  pairs, 
so  here.    Paul  nearly  always  had  one  or  more  companions. 
3.  When  they  had  fasted  {nesteus antes).     Either  finishing 
the  same  fast  in  verse  2  or  another  one  (Hackett),  but  clearly 
a  voluntary  fast.    Laid  their  hands  upon  them  (epithentes  tas 
cheiras  autois).  Second  aorist  active  participle  of  epitithemi. 
Not  ordination  to  the  ministry,  but  a  solemn  consecration 
to  the  great  missionary  task  to  which  the  Holy  Spirit  had 
called  them.    Whether  the  whole  church  took  part  in  this 
ceremony  is  not  clear,  though  in  15:40  "the  brethren"  did 
commend  Paul  and  Silas.    Perhaps  some  of  them  here  acted 
for  the  whole  church,  all  of  whom  approved  the  enterprise. 
But  Paul  makes  it  plain  in  Phil.  4:15  that  the  church  in 
Antioch  did  not  make  financial  contribution  to  the  cam- 
paign, but  only  goodwill.  But  that  was  more  than  the  church 
at  Jerusalem  would  have  done  as  a  whole  since  Peter  had 
been   arraigned   there  for  his   activities   in  Caesarea   (Acts 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  1 79 

11:1-18).  Clearly  Barnabas  and  Saul  had  to  finance  the 
tour  themselves.  It  was  Phillppi  that  first  gave  money  to 
Paul's  campaigns.  There  were  still  heathen  enough  in 
Antioch,  but  the  church  approved  the  going  of  Barnabas 
and  Saul,  their  very  best. 

4.  So  they  {autoi  men  oun).  They  themselves  indeed 
therefore.  No  contrast  is  necessary,  though  there  is  a  slight 
one  in  verses  5  and  6.  Luke  again  refers  to  the  Holy  Spirit 
as  the  source  of  their  authority  for  this  campaign  rather 
than  the  church  at  Antioch.  Sent  forth  {ekpemphthente s) . 
Old  verb  from  ekpempo  and  first  aorlst  passive  participle, 
but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  17:10.  Sailed  {apepleu- 
san).  Effective  aorist  active  indicative  of  apopleo,  old  verb 
to  sail  away,  depart  from.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  14:26; 
20:15;  27:1.  Barnabas  was  from  Cyprus  where  there  were 
many  Jews. 

5.  Proclaimed  {kateggellon).  Imperfect  active  of  kataggelWi 
inchoative,  began  to  proclaim.  This  was  Paul's  rule  of  pro- 
cedure, "to  the  Jew  first"  (Rom.  1:16;  Acts  13:46;  17:2; 
18:4,  19;  19:8).  They  had  also  {eichon  de  kai).  Imperfect  ac- 
tive, descriptive.  As  their  attendant  (hupereten).  Literally, 
"under-rower"  {hupo,  eretes)  In  the  trireme.  Probably  here 
minister  {chazzan)  or  assistant  in  the  synagogue  as  in  Luke 
4:20.  Cf.  Matt.  5:25.  It  is  not  clear  what  John  Mark  did, 
though  he  was  evidently  selected  by  Barnabas  as  his  cousin. 
He  may  have  helped  in  the  baptizing.  There  were  probably 
others  also  in  the  company  (verse  13).  The  "also"  may  mean 
that  Mark  did  some  preaching.  Barnabas  was  probably  the 
leader  In  the  work  in  these  Jewish  synagogues. 

6.  Unto  Paphos  (achri  Paphou).  The  new  Paphos  at  the 
other  end  of  the  island,  reached  by  a  fine  Roman  road,  some 
eight  miles  north  of  the  old  Paphos  famous  for  the  worship 
of  Venus.  A  certain  sorcerer,  a  false  prophet,  a  Jew  {andra 
tina  magon  pseudopropheten  loudaion).  Literally,  "a  certain 
man"  {andra  tina)  with  various  descriptive  epithets.     The 


l8o      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

word  magon  does  not  necessarily  mean  "sorcerer,"  but 
only  a  magus  (Matt.  2:1,  7,  10  which  see).  The  bad  sense 
occurs  in  Acts  8:9,  11  (Simon  Magus)  and  is  made  plain 
here  by  "false  prophet."  In  verse  8  here  Barjesus  (Son  of 
Jesus)  is  called  "Elymas  the  sorcerer  (or  Magian),"  prob- 
ably his  professional  title,  as  Luke  interprets  the  Arabic 
or  Aramaic  word  Elymas.  These  Jewish  mountebanks  were 
numerous  and  had  great  influence  with  the  uneducated. 
In  Acts  19:13  the  seven  sons  of  Sceva,  Jewish  exorcists, 
tried  to  imitate  Paul.  If  one  is  surprised  that  a  man  like 
SergiuG  Paulus  should  fall  under  the  influence  of  this  fraud, 
he  should  recall  what  Juvenal  says  of  the  Emperor  Tiberius 
"sitting  on  the  rock  of  Capri  with  his  flock  of  Chaldaeans 
around  him." 

7.  With  the  proconsul  Sergius  Paulus  (sun  toi  anthupatoi 
Sergioi  Pauloi).  Luke  used  to  be  sharply  criticized  for 
applying  this  term  to  Sergius  Paulus  on  the  ground  that 
Cyprus  was  a  province  under  the  appointment  of  the  em- 
peror with  the  title  of  propraetor  and  not  under  the  control 
of  the  senate  with  the  title  of  proconsul.  That  was  true  B.C. 
30,  but  five  years  later  it  was  changed  to  proconsul  by 
Augustus  and  put  under  the  control  of  the  Senate.  Two 
inscriptions  have  been  found  with  the  date  a.d.  51  and  52 
with  the  names  of  proconsuls  of  Cyprus  and  one  is  in  the 
Cesnola  Collection,  an  inscription  found  at  Soli  with  the 
name  of  Paulus  as  Proconsul,  undoubtedly  this  very  man, 
though  no  date  occurs.  A  man  of  understanding  {andri 
sunetbi).  All  the  more  amazing  that  he  should  be  a  victim 
of  Barjesus.  He  had  given  up  idolatry  at  any  rate  and  was 
eager  to  hear  Barnabas  and  Saul. 

8.  Withstood  them  {anthistatoautois).  Imperfect  middle  of 
anthistemi,  to  stand  against  (face  to  face).  Dative  case 
{autois).  He  persisted  in  his  opposition  and  was  unwilling  to 
lose  his  great  prize.  There  may  have  been  a  public  discus- 
sion between  Elymas  and  Saul.     To  turn  aside  (diastrepsai). 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  l8l 

First  aorist  active  infinitive  of  diastrepho,  old  verb  to  turn 
or  twist  in  two,  to  distort,  to  pervert  (cf.  Matt.  17:17;  Luke 
23:2). 

9.  But  Saul,  who  is  also  called  Paul  {Saulos  de^  ho  kai 
Paulos).  By  this  remarkably  brief  phrase  Luke  presents  this 
epoch  in  the  life  of  Saul  Paul.  The  "also"  {kai)  does  not 
mean  that  the  name  Paul  was  given  now  for  the  first  time, 
rather  than  he  had  always  had  it.  As  a  Jew  and  a  Roman 
citizen,  he  undoubtedly  had  both  names  all  the  time  (cf. 
John  Mark,  Symeon  Niger,  Barsabbas  Justus).  Jerome  held 
that  the  name  of  Sergius  Paulus  was  adopted  by  Saul  be- 
cause of  his  conversion  at  this  time,  but  this  is  a  wholly  un- 
likely explanation,  "an  element  of  vulgarity  impossible  to 
St.  Paul"  (Farrar).  Augustine  thought  that  the  meaning  of 
the  Latin  paulus  (little)  would  incline  Saul  to  adopt,  "but 
as  a  proper  name  the  word  rather  suggested  the  glories  of  the 
Aemilian  family,  and  even  to  us  recalls  the  name  of  another 
Paulus,  who  was  'lavish  of  his  noble  life'  "  (Page).  Among 
the  Jews  the  name  Saul  was  naturally  used  up  to  this  point, 
but  from  now  on  Luke  employs  Paul  save  when  there  is  a 
reference  to  his  previous  life  (Acts  22:7;  26:14).  His  real 
career  is  work  among  the  Gentiles  and  Paul  is  the  name  used 
by  them.  There  is  a  striking  similarity  in  sound  between  the 
Hebrew  Saul  and  the  Roman  Paul.  Paul  was  proud  of  his 
tribe  of  Benjamin  and  so  of  King  Saul  (Phil.  3:5).  Filled 
with  the  Holy  Spirit  (plestheis  pneumatos  hagiou).  First 
aorist  (ingressive)  passive  participle  of  pimplemi  with  the 
genitive  case.  A  special  influx  of  power  to  meet  this  emer- 
gency. Here  was  a  cultured  heathen,  typical  of  the  best  in 
Roman  life,  who  called  forth  all  the  powers  of  Paul  plus  the 
special  help  of  the  Holy  Spirit  to  expose  the  wickedness  of 
Elymas  Barjesus.  If  one  wonders  why  the  Holy  Spirit 
filled  Paul  for  this  emergency  rather  than  Barnabas,  when 
Barnabas  was  named  first  in  13:2,  he  can  recall  the  sov- 
ereignty of  the  Holy  Spirit  in  his  choice  of  agents  (I  Cor. 


1 82      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

12:4-11)  and  also  the  special  call  of  Paul  by  Christ  (Acts 
9:15;  26:i7f.).  Fastened  his  eyes  (atenisas).  As  already  in 
Luke  4:20;  22:56;  Acts  3:4,  12;  6:15;  10:4. 

10.  Of  all  guile  {pantos  dolou).  From  delo,  to  catch  with 
bait,  old  word,  already  seen  in  Matt.  26:4;  Mark  7:22; 
14:1.  Paul  denounces  Elymas  as  a  trickster.  J II  villainy 
{pases  rhdidiourgias).  Late  compound  from  rhdidiourgos 
{rhdidios,  easy,  facile,  ergon,  deed,  one  who  does  a  thing 
adroitly  and  with  ease).  So  levity  in  Xenophon  and  un- 
scrupulousness  in  Polybius,  Plutarch,  and  the  papyri.  Only 
here  in  the  N.T.,  though  the  kindred  word  rhdidiourgema 
occurs  in  Acts  18:14.  With  deadly  accuracy  Paul  pictured 
this  slick  rascal.  Thou  son  of  the  devil  {huie  diabolou).  Damn- 
ing phrase  like  that  used  by  Jesus  of  the  Pharisees  in  John 
8:44,  a  slanderer  like  the  diabolos.  This  use  of  son  {huios) 
for  characteristic  occurs  in  Acts  3:25;  4:36,  a  common 
Hebrew  idiom,  and  may  be  used  purposely  by  Paul  in  con- 
trast with  the  name  Barjesus  (son  of  Jesus)  that  Elymas 
bore  (13:6).  Enemy  of  all  righteousness  {echthre  pases  dikai- 
osunes).  Personal  enemy  to  all  justice,  sums  up  all  the  rest. 
Note  triple  use  of  "all"  {pantos, pases,  pi/ ^j), total  depravity 
in  every  sense.  Wilt  thou  not  cease?  {ou  pausei).  An  impa- 
tient rhetorical  question,  almost  volitive  in  force  (Robertson, 

Grammar,  p.  874).  Note  ou,  not  me.  To  pervert  {diastrephon). 
Present  active  participle  describing  the  actual  work  of 
Elymas  as  a  perverter  or  distorter  (see  verse  8).  More 
exactly.  Wilt  thou  not  cease  perverting.''  The  right  ways  of 
the  Lord  {tas  hodous  ton  kuriou  tas  eutheias).  The  ways  of  the 
Lord  the  straight  ones  as  opposed  to  the  crooked  ways  of 
men  (Isa.  40:4;  42:16;  Luke  3:5).  The  task  of  John  the 
Baptist  as  of  all  prophets  and  preachers  is  to  make  crooked 
paths  straight  and  to  get  men  to  walk  in  them.  This  false 
prophet  was  making  even  the  Lord's  straight  ways  crooked. 
Elymas  has  many  successors. 

11.  Upon  thee  {epi  se).   The  use  of  epi  with  the  accusative 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  183 

is  rich  and  varied,  the  precise  shade  of  meaning  depending 
on  the  content.  The  "hand  of  the  Lord"  might  be  kindly 
(Acts  11:21)  or  hostile  (Heb.  10:31),  but  when  God's  hand 
touches  one's  life  (Job  19:21)  it  may  be  in  judgment  as  here 
with  Elymas.  He  has  not  humbled  himself  under  the  mighty 
hand  of  God  (I  Peter  5:6).  Not  seeing  {me  blepbn).  Repeat- 
ing with  negative  participle  the  negative  idea  in  "blind" 
(tuphlos).  "It  was  a  judicial  infliction;  blindness  for  blind- 
ness, darkness  without  for  wilful  darkness  within"  (Fur- 
neaux).  He  was  an  example  of  the  blind  leading  the  blind 
that  was  to  cease  and  Sergius  Paulus  was  to  be  led  into  the 
light.  The  blindness  was  to  be  "for  a  season"  {achri  kairou, 
Luke  4:13),  if  it  should  please  God  to  restore  his  sight.  Paul 
apparently  recalls  his  own  blindness  as  he  entered  Damas- 
cus. A  mist  (achlus).  Especially  a  dimness  of  the  eyes,  old 
poetic  word  and  late  prose,  in  LXX,  only  here  in  N.T.  Galen 
uses  it  of  the  opacity  of  the  eye  caused  by  a  wound.  He  went 
about  seeking  some  one  to  lead  him  by  the  hand  (periagon 
ezetei  cheiragogous).  A  rather  free  rendering.  Literally, 
"going  about  {periagon,  present  active  participle  of  periago) 
he  was  seeking  {ezetei,  imperfect  active  of  zeteb)  guides 
{cheiragogous,  from  cheir,  hand,  and  agogos,  guide,  from 
ago,  one  who  leads  by  the  hand)."  The  very  verb  cheira- 
gogeb,  to  lead  by  the  hand,  Luke  uses  of  Paul  in  9:8,  as  he 
entered  Damascus. 

12.  Believed  {episteusen).  Ingressive  aorist  active  indica- 
tive. Renan  considers  it  impossible  that  a  Roman  pro- 
consul could  be  converted  by  a  miracle.  But  it  was  the 
teaching  about  the  Lord  {tou  kuriou,  objective  genitive) 
by  which  he  was  astonished  {ekplessomenos,  present  passive 
participle  of  ekplessb,  see  on  Matt.  7:28)  or  struck  out  as 
well  as  by  the  miracle.  The  blindness  came  "immediately" 
{parachrema)  upon  the  judgment  pronounced  by  Paul. 
It  is  possible  that  Sergius  Paulus  was  converted  to  Christ 
without  openly  identifying  himself  with  the  Christians  as 


1 84      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

his  baptism  is  not  mentioned  as  in  the  case  of  Cornelius. 
But,  even  if  he  was  baptized,  he  need  not  have  been  deposed 
from  his  proconsulship  as  Furneaux  and  Rackham  argue 
because  his  office  called  for  "official  patronage  of  idolatrous 
worship."  But  that  could  have  been  merely  perfunctory 
as  it  probably  was  already.  He  had  been  a  disciple  of  the 
Jewish  magician,  Elymas  Barjesus,  without  losing  his  posi- 
tion. Imperial  persecution  against  Christianity  had  not 
yet  begun.  Furneaux  even  suggests  that  the  conversion  of 
a  proconsul  to  Christianity  at  this  stage  would  have  called 
for  mention  by  the  Roman  and  Greek  historians.  There 
is  the  name  Sergia  Paullina  in  a  Christian  cemetery 
in  Rome  which  shows  that  one  of  his  family  was  a  Chris- 
tian later.  One  will  believe  what  he  wills  about  Sergius 
Paulus,  but  I  do  not  see  that  Luke  leaves  him  in  the  cate- 
gory of  Simon  Magus  who  "believed"  (8:13)  for  revenue 
only. 

13.  Paul  and  his  company  .{hoi  peri  Paulon).  Neat  Greek 
idiom  as  in  Plato,  Cratylus  440  C  hoi  peri  Herakleiton.  On 
this  idiom  see  Gildersleeve,  Syntax,  p.  264.  It  means  a  man 
and  his  followers,  "those  around  Paul."  Now  Paul  ranks 
first  always  in  Acts  save  in  14:2;  15:12,  25  for  special  reasons. 
Heretofore  Saul  (Paul)  held  a  secondary  position  (9:27; 
11:30;  I3:if.).  "In  nothing  is  the  greatness  of  Barnabas 
more  manifest  than  in  his  recognition  of  the  superiority 
of  Paul  and  acceptance  of  a  secondary  position  for  himself" 
(Furneaux).  Set  sail  (anachthentes).  First  aorist  passive 
participle  of  anago.  Thirteen  times  in  the  Acts  and  Luke 
8 :22  which  see.  They  sailed  up  to  sea  and  came  down  {katago, 
katahainb)  to  land.  So  it  looks.  Departed  from  them  (apo- 
choresas  ap^  auton).  First  aorist  active  participle  of  apo- 
choreo,  old  verb  to  withdraw,  go  away  from.  In  the  N.T. 
only  here  and  Matt.  7:23;  Luke  9:39.  He  is  called  John 
there  as  in  verse  5  and  Mark  in  15:39,  though  John  Mark 
in  12:12,  25.    This  may  be  accidental  or  on  purpose  (Deiss- 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  185 

mann,  Bible  Studies,  p.  317).  Luke  is  silent  on  John's  reasons 
for  leaving  Paul  and  Barnabas.  He  was  the  cousin  of  Barna- 
bas and  may  not  have  relished  the  change  in  leadership. 
There  may  have  been  change  in  plans  also  now  that  Paul 
is  in  command.  Barnabas  had  chosen  Cyprus  and  Paul 
has  led  them  to  Perga  in  Pamphylia  and  means  to  go  on  into 
the  highlands  to  Antioch  in  Pisidia.  There  were  perils  of 
many  sorts  around  them  and  ahead  (II  Cor.  11 :26),  perils  to 
which  John  Mark  was  unwilling  to  be  exposed.  Paul  will 
specifically  charge  him  at  Antioch  with  desertion  of  his 
post  (Acts  15:39).  It  is  possible,  as  Ramsay  suggests,  that 
the  mosquitoes  at  Perga  gave  John  malaria.  If  so,  they  bit 
Paul  and  Barnabas  also.  He  may  not  have  liked  Paul's 
aggressive  attitude  towards  the  heathen.  At  any  rate  he 
went  home  to  Jerusalem  instead  of  to  Antioch,  zu  seiner 
Mutter  (Holtzmann).  It  was  a  serious  breach  in  the  work, 
but  Paul  and  Barnabas  stuck  to  the  work. 

14.  Passing  through  {dielthontes).  It  is  not  clear  why  Paul 
and  Barnabas  left  Perga  so  soon  nor  why  they  went  to  Anti- 
och in  Pisidia.  Ramsay  suggests  malaria  that  spurred  them  on 
to  the  hills  after  the  desertion  of  John  Mark.  They  preached 
at  Perga  on  the  return  (14:25)  and  apparently  hurried  away 
now.  Farrar  thinks  that  the  hot  weather  had  driven  the 
population  to  the  hills.  At  any  rate  it  is  not  difficult  to 
imagine  the  perils  of  this  climb  over  the  rough  mountain 
way  from  Perga  to  Pisidian  Antioch  to  which  Paul  appar- 
ently refers  in  II  Cor.  11 :26.  Sat  down  (ekathisan).  Ingressive 
aorist  active  indicative,  took  their  seats  as  visiting  Jews, 
possibly  in  the  seats  of  the  rabbis  (J.  Lightfoot).  Whether 
they  expected  to  be  called  on  or  not,  they  were  given  the 
opportunity  as  prominent  visitors.  The  Pisidian  Antioch  was 
really  in  Phrygia,  but  towards  Pisidia  to  distinguish  it  from 
Antioch  on  the  Maeander  (Ramsay,  Church  in  the  Roman 
Empire,  p.  25).  It  was  a  colony  like  Philippi  and  so  a  free 
city.    If  Paul  is  referring  to  South  Galatia  and  not  North 


1 86      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Galatia  in  Gal.  4:13  when  he  says  that  his  preaching  in 
Galatia  at  first  was  due  to  illness,  then  it  was  probably  here 
at  Pisidian  Antioch.  What  it  was  we  have  no  means  of  know- 
ing, though  it  was  a  temptation  in  his  flesh  to  them  so 
severe  that  they  were  willing  to  pluck  out  their  eyes  for  him 
(Gal.  4:i4f.).  Opthalmia,  malaria,  epilepsy  have  all  been 
suggested  as  this  stake  in  the  flesh  (II  Cor.  12:7).  But  Paul 
was  able  to  preach  with  power  whatever  his  actual  physical 
condition  was. 

15.  After  the  reading  of  the  law  and  the  prophets  (meta  ten 
anagnosin  tou  nomou  kai  ton  propheton).  The  law  was  first 
read  in  the  synagogues  till  B.C.  163  when  Antiochus  Epiph- 
ones  prohibited  it.  Then  the  reading  of  the  prophets  was 
substituted  for  it.  The  Maccabees  restored  both.  There 
was  a  reading  from  the  law  and  one  from  the  prophets  in 
Hebrew  which  was  interpreted  into  the  Aramaic  or  the 
Greek  Koine  for  the  people.  The  reading  was  followed  by 
the  sermon  as  when  Jesus  was  invited  to  read  and  to  preach  in 
Nazareth  (Luke  4:i6f.).  For  the  service  in  the  synagogue  see 
Schuerer,  History  of  the  Jewish  People,  Div.  II,  Vol.  II, 
pp.  79ff ,  It  was  the  duty  of  the  rulers  of  the  synagogue  (arch- 
isunagogoi)  to  select  the  readers  and  the  speakers  for  the 
service  (Mark  5:22,  35-38;  Luke  8:49;  13:14;  Acts  13:15; 
18:8,  17).  Any  rabbi  or  distinguished  stranger  could  be 
called  on  to  speak.  //  ye  have  any  word  of  exhortation  for  the 
people  {ei  tis  estin  en  humin  logos  parakleseos  pros  ton  laon). 
Literally,  if  there  is  among  you  any  word  of  exhortation  for 
the  people.  It  is  a  condition  of  the  first  class  and  assumed  to 
be  true,  a  polite  invitation.  On  "exhortation"  {paraklesis) 
see  9:3 1.  It  may  be  a  technical  phrase  used  in  the  synagogue 
(Heb.  13:22;  I  Tim.  4:13). 

16.  Paul  stood  up  (anastas  Paulos).  The  Jewish  custom 
was  to  sit  while  speaking  (Luke  4:20),  but  the  Greek  and 
Roman  was  to  stand  (Acts  17:22).  It  is  possible  as  Lewin 
{Life  of  St.  Paul,  Vol.  I,  p.    141)  suggests  that  here  Paul 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  187 

stepped  upon  the  platform  and  then  took  his  seat  as  he  began 
to  speak  or  he  may  have  followed  the  Greek  and  Roman 
custom.  Paul  is  the  leader  now  and  the  more  gifted  speaker 
(Acts  14:12),  so  that  he  responds  to  the  courteous  invitation 
of  the  rulers.  Beckoning  {kataseisas).  First  aorist  active 
participle  of  kataseio,  old  verb  to  shake  down,  a  dramatic 
gesture  for  quiet  and  order  like  Peter  in  12:17  ^^id  Paul  on 
the  steps  of  the  tower  of  Antonia  (21 :4o).  And  ye  that  fear 
God  (kai  hoi  phoboumenoi  ton  theon).  Evidently  large  num- 
bers of  these  Gentiles  like  Cornelius  in  Caesarea  were  pres- 
ent. They  offered  Paul  a  great  opportunity  for  reaching  the 
purely  pagan  Gentiles.  This  (verses  16-41)  is  the  first  full 
report  of  a  sermon  of  Paul's  that  Luke  has  preserved  for  us. 
He  is  now  a  practised  preacher  of  the  gospel  that  he  began 
proclaiming  at  Damascus,  that  Jesus  of  Nazareth  is  the 
Messiah  of  promise  and  the  Saviour  of  the  whole  world 
both  Jew  and  Gentile  if  they  will  only  believe  on  him  and 
be  saved.  It  is  possible  that  Paul  here  based  his  sermon  on 
the  passages  of  the  law  and  the  prophets  that  had  just  been 
read.  He  uses  two  words  from  the  LXX,  one  in  verse  19 
from  Deut.  1:31  etrophophoresen  (as  a  nursing-father  bare 
he  them),  the  reading  of  many  old  MSS.  and  the  one  pre- 
ferred by  the  American  Committee,  the  other  in  verse  17 
from  Isaiah  1:2  hupsosen  (exalted).  At  any  rate  it  is  clear 
that  Paul  spoke  in  Greek  so  that  all  could  understand  his 
sermon.  He  may  have  written  out  notes  of  this  sermon  after- 
wards for  Luke.  The  keynotes  of  Paul's  theology  as  found 
in  his  Epistles  appear  in  this  sermon.  It  is  interesting  to 
observe  the  steady  growth  of  Paul's  Christology  as  he  faced 
the  great  problems  of  his  day.  Here  we  see  Paul's  gospel 
for  the  Jews  and  the  God-fearers  (Gentiles  friendly  to  the 
Jews). 

17.  Chose  (exelexato).  First  aorist  middle  (indirect), se- 
lected for  himself.  Israel  was  the  chosen  people.  Exalted 
(hupsosen).     From  hupsoo,  late  verb  from  hupsos  so  often

used  of  Christ.  When  they  sojourned  {en  tei  paroikidi).  In 
the  sojourn.  Late  word  from  paroikos  (sojourner,  dweller, 
Acts  7:6)  common  in  LXX.  In  N.T.  only  here  and  I  Peter 
1:17.  With  a  high  arm  {meta  brachionos  hupselou).  Vivid 
picture  from  the  LXX  (Ex.  6:1,  6;  Deut.  5:15;  Psa.  136:12). 

18.  Suffered  he  their  manners  (etropophoresen).  First 
aorist  active  indicative  of  tropophoreo,  late  word  from  tropoSy 
manner,  and  phero,  reading  of  Aleph  B  D  and  accepted  by 
Westcott  and  Hort.  But  A  C  Sahidic  Bohairic  read  etro- 
phophoresen  from  trophophoreo  (irophos,  a  nurse,  and  phero,) 
late  word  (II  Mace.  7:27),  probably  correct  word  here  and 
Deut.  1:31. 

19.  When  he  had  destroyed  (kathelon).  Second  aorist  active 
participle  of  kathaireo,  to  tear  down,  old  verb.  He  gave  them 
for  an  inheritance  (katekleronomesen).  First  aorist  active 
indicative  of  the  double  compound  verb  kata-klero-nomeo, 
late  verb  in  LXX  (Numb.  34:18;  Deut.  3:28;  Josh.  14:1) 
and  only  here  in  the  N.T.,  to  distribute  by  lot,  to  distribute 
as  an  inheritance.  This  is  the  correct  reading  and  not  ka- 
teklerodotesen  from  kataklerodoteo  of  the  Textus  Receptus. 
These  two  verbs  were  confused  in  the  MSS.  of  the  LXX  as 
well  as  here.  For  about  four  hundred  and  fifty  years  {hos 
etesin  tetrakosiois  kai  pentekonta).  Associative  instrumental 
case  with  an  expression  of  time  as  in  8:11;  Luke  8:29  (Rob- 
ertson, Grammar,  p.  527).  The  oldest  MSS-  (Aleph  ABC 
Vg  Sah  Boh)  place  these  figures  before  "after  these  things" 
and  so  in  verse  19.  This  is  the  true  reading  and  is  in  agree- 
ment with  the  notation  in  I  Kings  6:1.  The  difficulty  found 
in  the  Textus  Receptus  (King  James  Version)  thus  disap- 
pears with  the  true  text.  The  four  hundred  and  fifty  years 
runs  therefore  from  the  birth  of  Isaac  to  the  actual  con- 
quest of  Canaan  and  does  not  cover  the  period  of  the  Judges. 
See  on  Acts  7:6. 

20.  And  after  these  things  {kai  meta  tauta).  That  is,  the 
time  of  the  Judges  then  began.     Cf.  Judges  2:16.     Until 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  189 

Samuel  the  prophet  (heos  Samouel  prophetou).  The  terminus 
ad  quern.  He  was  the  last  of  the  judges  and  the  first  of  the 
prophets  who  selected  the  first  king  (Saul)  under  God's 
guidance.  Note  the  absence  of  the  Greek  article  with  pro- 
phetou. 

21.  They  asked  (eitesanto).  First  aorist  indirect  middle 
indicative,  they  asked  for  themselves.  They  were  tired  of  a 
theocracy.  Cf.  I  Sam.  8:5;  10:1.  Paul  mentions  with  pride 
that  Benjamin  was  the  tribe  of  Saul  (his  name  also),  but  he 
does  not  allude  to  Saul's  sin  (Eurneaux).  For  the  space  of 
forty  years  {ete  tesserakonta).  Accusative  of  extent  of  time. 
Not  in  the  O.T.,  but  in  Josephus,  Ant.  VI.  14,  9. 

22.  When  he  had  removed  him  {metastesas  auton).  First 
aorist  active  participle  of  methistemi,  old  verb  to  transfer, 
to  transpose  (note  force  of  meta).  This  verb  occurs  in  Luke 
16:4  by  the  unjust  steward  about  his  removal  from  office. 
Cf.  I  Sam.  15:16.  To  be  {eis).  As  or  for,  Greek  idiom  like 
the  Hebrew  le,  common  in  the  LXX.  A  man  after  my  heart 
{andra  kata  ten  kardian  mou).  The  words  quoted  by  Paul 
as  a  direct  saying  of  God  are  a  combination  of  Psa.  89:20, 
21  and  I  Sam.  13:14  (the  word  of  the  Lord  to  Samuel  about 
David).  Knowling  thinks  that  this  free  and  rather  loose  quo- 
tation of  the  substance  argues  for  the  genuineness  of  the 
report  of  Paul's  sermon.  Hackett  observes  that  the  commen- 
dation of  David  is  not  absolute,  but,  as  compared  with  the 
disobedient  Saul,  he  was  a  man  who  did  God's  will  in  spite 
of  the  gross  sin  of  which  he  repented  (Psa.  51).  Note  "wills" 
(thelemata),  plural,  of  God. 

23.  Of  this  man's  seed  {toutou  apo  tou  spermatos).  Em- 
phatic position  of  toutou.  Of  this  one  from  the  (his)  seed. 
According  to  promise  (kaf  epaggelian) .  This  phrase  in  Gal. 
3:29;  H  Tim.  1:1.  See  the  promise  in  H  Sam.  7:2;  Psa. 
132:11;  Isa.  1 1:1,  10;  Jer.  23:5^;  Zech.  3:8.  In  Zech.  3:8 
the  verb  ago  is  used  of  the  sending  of  the  Messiah  as  here. 
A  Saviour  Jesus  (Sotera  lesoun).  Jesus  Is  in  apposition  with 


I90      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Saviour  (accusative  case)  and  comes  at  the  end  of  the  sen- 
tence in  contrast  with  "this  man"  (David)  at  the  beginning. 
Paul  goes  no  further  than  David  because  he  suggests  to  him 
Jesus,  descendant  in  the  flesh  from  David.  By  "Israel" 
here  Paul  means  the  Jewish  people,  though  he  will  later 
enlarge  this  promise  to  include  the  spiritual  Israel  both 
Gentile  and  Jew  (Rom.  g:6i.). 

24.  When  John  had  first  preached  {prokeruxantos  loanou). 
Literally,  John  heralding  beforehand,  as  a  herald  before  the 
king  (Luke  3:3).  Genitive  absolute  of  first  aorist  active 
participle  of  prokerussOy  old  verb  to  herald  beforehand,  here 
alone  in  the  N.T.,  though  Textus  Receptus  has  it  also  in 
Acts  3 :20.  Before  his  coming  {pro  prosdpou  tes  eisodou  au- 
tou).  Literally,  before  the  face  of  his  entering  in  (here  act 
of  entrance  as  I  Thess.  1 19,  not  the  gate  as  in  Heb.  10:19). 
See  Mai.  3:1  quoted  in  Matt.  11:10  (  =  Luke  7:27)  for  this 
Hebrew  phrase  and  also  Luke  i  :76.  The  baptism  of  repent- 
ance {baptisma  metanoias).  Baptism  marked  by,  charac- 
terized by  (genitive  case,  case  of  kind  or  species)  repentance 
(change  of  mind  and  life).  The  very  phrase  used  of  John's 
preaching  in  Mark  1:4  =  Luke  3:3.  It  is  clear  therefore  that 
Paul  understood  John's  ministry  and  message  as  did  Peter 
(Acts  2:38;  10:37). 

25.  As  John  was  fulfilling  his  course  {hos  eplerou  loanes 
ton  dromon).  Imperfect  active  of  pleroo,  describing  his  vivid 
ministry  without  defining  the  precise  period  when  John 
asked  the  question.  Paul  uses  this  word  dromos  (course) 
of  his  own  race  (Acts  20:24;  II  Tim.  4:7).  What  suppose  ye 
that  I  am?  {Ti  erne  huponoeite  einai?)  Note  ti  (neuter),  not 
tina  (masculine),  what  not  who^  character,  not  identity. 
It  is  indirect  discourse  (the  infinitive  einai  and  the  accusa- 
tive of  general  reference).  Huponoed  (hupo,  noed)  is  to 
think  secretly,  to  suspect,  to  conjecture.  /  am  not  he  {auk 
eimi  ego).  These  precise  words  are  not  given  in  the  Gospels, 
but  the  idea  is  the  same  as  the  disclaimers  by  the  Baptist 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  191 

in  John  1:19-27  (cf.  also  Matt.  3:ii=Mark  i:7  =  Luke 
3:16).  Paul  had  a  true  grasp  of  the  message  of  the  Baptist. 
He  uses  the  very  form  lusai  (first  aorist  active  infinitive  of 
luo)  found  in  Mark  1:7  and  Luke  3:16  and  the  word  for 
shoes  {hupodema,  singular)  in  all  three.  His  quotation  is 
remarkably  true  to  the  words  in  the  Synoptic  Gospels.  How 
did  Paul  get  hold  of  the  words  of  the  Baptist  so  clearly? 

26.  To  us  {hemin).  Both  Jews  and  Gentiles,  both  classes 
in  Paul's  audience,  dative  of  advantage.  Is  sent  forth  {ex- 
apestale).  Second  aorist  passive  indicative  of  the  double 
compound  verb  exapostello,  common  verb  to  send  out  (ex) 
and  forth  (apo).  It  is  a  climacteric  or  culminative  aorist 
tense.  It  has  come  to  us  in  one  day,  this  glorious  promise. 
The  word  of  this  salvation  {ho  logos  tes  sbterias  tautes).  The 
message  of  Jesus  as  Saviour  (verse  23),  long  ago  promised 
and  now  come  to  us  as  Saviour. 

27.  Because  they  knew  him  not  (touton  agnoesantes).  First 
aorist  active  participle  (causal)  of  agnoeo,  old  verb,  not  to 
know.  Peter  gives  "ignorance"  (agnoia)  as  the  excuse  of  the 
Jews  in  the  death  of  Christ  (3:17)  and  Paul  does  the  same 
about  his  conduct  before  his  conversion  (I  Tim.  1:13). 
This  ignorance  mitigated  the  degree  of  their  guilt,  but  it  did 
not  remove  it,  for  it  was  willing  ignorance  and  prejudice. 
The  voices  of  the  prophets  which  are  read  [tas  phonas  ton 
propheton  tas  anaginoskomenas) .  Object  also  of  agnoesantes^ 
though  it  could  be  the  object  of  eplerosan  (fulfilled)  if  kai 
is  taken  as  "also".  The  "voices"  were  heard  as  they  were 
read  aloud  each  Sabbath  in  the  synagogue.  In  their  ignorant 
condemnation  they  fulfilled  the  prophecies  about  the  suffer- 
ing Messiah. 

28.  Though  they  found  no  cause  of  death  (medemian  aitian 
thanatou  heurontes).  Second  aorist  active  with  usual  nega- 
tive of  the  participle.  As  a  matter  of  fact  the  Sanhedrin  did 
charge  Jesus  with  blasphemy,  but  could  not  prove  it  (Matt. 
26:65;  27:24;  Luke  23 :22).  At  this  time  no  Gospel  had  prob- 


192      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

ably  been  written,  but  Paul  knew  that  Jesus  was  innocent. 
He  uses  this  same  idiom  about  his  own  innocence  (Acts  28: 
18).  That  he  should  be  slain  {anairethenai  auton) .  First  aorist 
passive  infinitive,  the  accusative  case,  the  direct  object  of 
Htesanto  (first  aorist  middle  indicative,  asked  as  a  favour  to 
themselves). 

29.  From  the  tree  {apo  tou  xulou).  Not  here  strictly  a 
tree,  but  wood  as  already  in  5:30;  10:29  and  later  in  Gal. 
3:13.  Strictly  speaking,  it  was  Joseph  of  Arimathea  and 
Nicodemus  who  took  the  body  of  Jesus  down  from  the  cross, 
though  the  Jews  had  asked  Pilate  to  have  the  bones  of  Jesus 
broken  that  his  body  should  not  remain  on  the  cross  during 
the  Sabbath  (John  19:31).  Paul  does  not  distinguish  the 
details  here.  Laid  (ethekan).  First  (kappa)  aorist  active  in- 
dicative third  plural  of  tithemi  in  place  of  ethesan  the  usual 
second  aorist  active  plural  form.  Tomb  (mnemeion).  Memo- 
rial, common  in  the  Gospels. 

30.  But  God  raised  him  from  the  dead  {ho  de  theos  egeiren 
ek  nekron).  This  crucial  fact  Paul  puts  sharply  as  he  always 
did. 

31.  Was  seen  for  many  days  {ophthe  epi  hemeras  pleious). 
The  common  verb  (first  aorist  passive  indicative  of  horao^ 
to  see)  for  the  appearance  of  the  Risen  Christ,  the  one  used 
by  Paul  of  his  own  vision  of  Christ  (I  Cor.  15:8),  which  is 
not  reported  by  Luke  here.  For  more  days  (than  a  few), 
the  language  means,  forty  in  all  (l  :3).  Of  them  that  came  up 
with  him  (tois  sunanabdsin  autoi).  Dative  (after  ophthe) 
articular  participle  (second  aorist  active  of  sunanabaino) 
with  associative  instrumental  case  (autoi),  the  very  men 
who  knew  him  best  and  who  could  not  be  easily  deceived 
about  the  reality  of  his  resurrection.  But  this  fact  rules  Paul 
out  on  this  point,  for  he  had  not  fellowshipped  with  Jesus 
from  Galilee  to  Jerusalem.  Who  are  now  his  witnesses  (hoiti- 
nes  nun  eisin  martures  autou).  The  very  point  that  Peter  used 
to  clinch  his  argument  with  such  powerful  effect  (2:32;  3:15). 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  193 

32.  We  bring  you  good  tidings  of  the  promise  (hemeis  humds 
euaggelizometha  ten  epaggelian).  Two  accusatives  here  (per- 
son and  thing),  old  Greek  did  not  use  accusative  of  the 
person  with  this  verb  as  in  16:10;  Luke  3  :i8.  Note  "we  you" 
together.  Here  the  heart  of  Paul's  message  on  this  occasion. 

33.  Hath  fulfilled  (ekpepleroken).  Hath  filled  out  (ek). 
Unto  our  children  (tois  teknois  hemon).  The  MSS.  vary 
greatly  here  about  hemon  (our),  some  have  auton,  some 
auton  hemin.  Westcott  and  Hort  consider  these  readings 
"a  primitive  error"  for  hemin  (to  us)  taken  with  anastesas 
lesoun  (having  for  us  raised  up  Jesus).  This  raising  up  (from 
anistemi,  set  up)  as  in  3:22;  7:37  refers  not  to  resurrection 
(verse  34),  but  to  the  sending  of  Jesus  (two  raisings  up). 
In  the  second  psalm  {en  toi  psalmoi  tbi  deuteroi),  Psa.  2:7. 
D  has  protoi  because  the  first  psalm  was  often  counted  as 
merely  introductory. 

34.  Now  no  more  to  return  to  corruption  {meketi  mellonta 
hupostrephein  eis  diaphthoran).  No  longer  about  to  return 
as  Lazarus  did.  Jesus  did  not  die  again  and  so  is  the  first 
fruits  of  the  resurrection  (I  Cor.  15:23;  Rom.  6:9).  He  hath 
spoken  (eireken).  Present  perfect  active  indicative,  common 
way  of  referring  to  the  permanent  utterances  of  God  which 
are  on  record  in  the  Scriptures.  The  holy  and  sure  blessings  of 
David  {ta  hosia  Daueid  ta  pista).  See  H  Sam.  7:13.  Literally, 
"the  holy  things  of  David  the  trustworthy  things."  He 
explains  "the  holy  things"  at  once. 

35.  Because  (dioti).  Compound  conjunction  {dia,  hoti) 
like  our  "because  that."  The  reason  for  the  previous  state- 
ment about  "the  holy  things."  Thou  wilt  not  give  thy  holy  one 
to  see  corruption  (ou  doseis  ton  hosion  sou  idein  diaphthoran). 
Quotation  from  Psa.  16:10  to  show  that  Jesus  did  not  see 
corruption  in  his  body,  a  flat  contradiction  for  those  who 
deny  the  bodily  resurrection  of  Jesus. 

36.  His  own  generation  {ididi  genedi).  Either  locative 
case,  "in  his  own  generation"  or  dative  object  of  huperetesas 


194      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

(served).  The  counsel  of  God  {tei  tou  theou  boulei).  So  here, 
either  the  dative,  the  object  of  huperetesas  if  genedi  is  loca- 
tive, or  the  instrumental  case  "by  the  counsel  of  God" 
which  again  may  be  construed  either  with  huperetesas  (hav- 
ing served)  or  after  ekoimethe  (fell  on  sleep).  Either  of  the 
three  ways  is  grammatical  and  makes  good  sense.  Koimao- 
mai  for  death  we  have  already  had  (Acts  7:60).  So  Jesus 
(John  ii:ii)  and  Paul  (I  Cor.  15:6,  51).  Was  laid  {prose- 
tethe).  Was  added  unto  (first  aorist  passive  indicative  of 
prostithemi).  See  the  verb  in  2:47;  5:14.  This  figure  for  death 
probably  arose  from  the  custom  of  burying  families  together 
(Gen.  15:15;  Judg.  2:10).  Saw  corruption  {eiden  diaph- 
thoran).  As  Jesus  did  not  (Acts  2:31)  as  he  shows  in  verse  37. 

38.  Through  this  man  (dia  toutou).  This  very  man  whom 
the  Jews  had  crucified  and  whom  God  had  raised  from  the 
dead.  Remission  of  sins  {aphesis  hamartion)  is  proclaimed 
(kataggelletai)  to  you.  This  is  the  keynote  of  Paul's  message 
as  it  had  been  that  of  Peter  at  Pentecost  (2:38;  5:31;  10:43). 
Cf.  26:18.  This  glorious  message  Paul  now  presses  home  in 
his  exhortation. 

39.  y4nd  by  him  every  one  that  helieveth  is  justified  from  all 
things^  from  which  ye  could  not  be  justified  by  the  law  of  Moses 
(kai  apo  pantbn  hon  ouk  edunethete  en  nomoi  Mouseos 
dikaiothenai  en  toutoi  pas  ho  pisteuon  dikaioutai).  This  is 
a  characteristic  Greek  sentence  with  the  principal  clause 
at  the  end  and  Pauline  to  the  core.  A  literal  rendering  as  to 
the  order  would  be:  "And  from  all  the  things  from  {apo 
not  repeated  in  the  Greek,  but  understood,  the  ablative  case 
being  repeated)  which  ye  were  not  able  to  be  justified  in  this 
one  every  one  who  believes  is  justified."  The  climax  is  at  the 
close  and  gives  us  the  heart  of  Paul's  teaching  about  Christ. 
"We  have  here  the  germ  of  all  that  is  most  characteristic  in 
Paul's  later  teaching.  It  is  the  argument  of  the  Epistle  to 
Galatians  and  Romans  in  a  sentence"  (Furneaux).  The 
failure  of  the  Mosaic  law  to  bring  the  kind  of  righteousness 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  195 

that  God  demands  is  stated.  This  is  made  possible  in  and 
by  (en)  Christ  alone.  Paul's  favourite  words  occur  here, 
pisteud,  believe,  with  which  pistis^  faith,  is  allied,  dikaiod,  to 
set  right  with  God  on  the  basis  of  faith.  In  Rom.  6:7  Paul 
uses  apo  also  after  dikaiod.  These  are  key  words  {pisteud 
and  dikaiod)  in  Paul's  theology  and  call  for  prolonged  and 
careful  study  if  one  is  to  grasp  the  Pauline  teaching.  Dikaioo 
primarily  means  to  make  righteous,  to  declare  righteous 
like  axioo,  to  deem  worthy  (axios).  But  in  the  end  Paul  holds 
that  real  righteousness  will  come  (Rom.  6-8)  to  those  whom 
God  treats  as  righteous  (Rom.  3-5)  though  both  Gentile  and 
Jew  fall  short  without  Christ  (Rom.  1-3).  This  is  the  doc- 
trine of  grace  that  will  prove  a  stumbling  block  to  the  Jews 
with  their  ceremonial  works  and  foolishness  to  the  Greeks 
with  their  abstract  philosophical  ethics  (I  Cor.  1:23-25). 
It  is  a  new  and  strange  doctrine  to  the  people  of  Antioch. 

40.  Beware  therefore  (blepete  oun).  The  warning  is  perti- 
nent. Perhaps  Paul  noticed  anger  on  the  faces  of  some  of  the 
rabbis.  Lest  there  come  upon  you  {me  epelthei).  Second  aorist 
active  subjunctive  with  the  negative  final  conjunction  me. 
In  the  prophets  {en  tots  prophetais).  The  quotation  is  from 
the  LXX  text  of  Hab.  1:5.  The  plural  here  refers  to  the 
prophetic  collection  (Luke  24:44;  Acts  24:14).  "The  Jews 
of  Habakkukjs  day  had  refused  to  believe  in  the  impending 
invasion  by  the  Chaldeans,  and  yet  it  had  come"  (Fur- 
neaux). 

41.  Ye  despisers  {hoi  kataphronetai) .  Not  in  the  Hebrew, 
but  in  the  LXX.  It  is  pertinent  for  Paul's  purpose.  Perish 
{aphanisthete) .  Or  vanish  away.  First  aorist  passive  imper- 
ative. Added  by  the  LXX  to  the  Hebrew.  //  one  declare 
it  unto  you  {ean  tis  ekdiegetai  humin).  Condition  of  third 
class  with  present  middle  subjunctive,  if  one  keep  on  out- 
lining (double  compound,  ek-di-egeomai)  it  unto  you.  Paul 
has  hurled  a  thunderbolt  at  the  close. 

42.  And  as  they  went  out  {Exionton  de  auton).    Genitive 


196      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

absolute  with  present  active  participle  of  exeimi,  to  go  out, 
old  verb,  in  the  N.T.  only  in  Acts  12:42;  17:15;  20:7;  27:43. 
As  they  (Paul  and  Barnabas)  were  going  out  with  all  the  ex- 
citement and  hubbub  created  by  the  sermon.  They  besought 
(parekaloun).  Imperfect  active,  inchoative,  began  to  beseech. 
The  Textus  Receptus  inserts  wrongly  ta  ethne  (the  Gentiles) 
as  if  the  Jews  were  opposed  to  Paul  from  the  first  as  some 
doubtless  were.  But  both  Jews  and  Gentiles  asked  for  the 
repetition  of  the  sermon  {lalethenai^  first  aorist  passive  infin- 
itive object  of  parekaloun  with  accusative  of  general  refer- 
ence). The  next  Sabbath  (eis  to  metaxu  sabbaton).  Late  use 
(Josephus,  Plutarch,  etc.)  of  metaxu  (meta  and  xun  =  sun) 
in  sense  of  after  or  next  instead  of  between  (sense  of  meta 
prevailing).    Note  use  of  eis  for  "on"  or  "by." 

43.  When  the  synagogue  broke  up  {lutheises  tes  sunagbges). 
Genitive  absolute  of  first  aorist  passive  participle  of  luo. 
Apparently  Paul  and  Barnabas  had  gone  out  before  the  syn- 
agogue was  formally  dismissed.  Of  the  devout  proselytes 
{ton  sebomenbn  proselutbn).  Of  the  worshipping  proselytes 
described  in  verses  16  and  25  as  "those  who  fear  God"  (cf. 
16:14)  employed  usually  of  the  uncircumcised  Gentiles  who 
yet  attended  the  synagogue  worship,  but  the  word  proselutoi 
{pros,  elutos  verbal  from  erchomai,  a  new-comer)  means 
usually  those  who  had  become  circumcised  (proselytes  of 
righteousness).  Yet  the  rabbis  used  it  also  of  proselytes  of 
the  gate  who  had  not  yet  become  circumcised,  probably  the 
idea  here.  In  the  N.T.  the  word  occurs  only  in  Matt.  23:15; 
Acts  2:11  (10);  6:5;  13:43.  Many  (both  Jews  and  prose- 
lytes) followed  (ekolouthesan,  ingressive  aorist  active  indica- 
tive of  akoloutheb)  Paul  and  Barnabas  to  hear  more  with- 
out waiting  till  the  next  Sabbath.  So  we  are  to  picture  Paul 
and  Barnabas  speaking  {proslalountes,  late  compound,  in 
N.T.  only  here  and  28:20)  to  eager  groups.  Urged  {epeithon). 
Imperfect  active  of  peithb,  either  descriptive  (were  persuad- 
ing) or  conative  (were  trying  to  persuade).    Paul  had  great 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  197 

powers  of  persuasion  (18:4;  19:8,  26;  26:28;  28:23;  ^I  Cor. 
5:11;  Gal.  1:10).  These  Jews  "were  beginning  to  under- 
stand for  the  first  time  the  true  meaning  of  their  national 
history"  (Furneaux),  "the  grace  of  God"  to  them. 

44.  The  next  Sabbath  {toi  erchomenoi  sabbatoi).  Locative 
case,  on  the  coming  {erchomenoi,  present  middle  participle  of 
erchomai)  Sabbath.  So  the  best  MSB.,  though  some  have  echo- 
menoi  (present  middle  participle  of  echo  in  sense  of  near, 
bordering,  following  as  in  Luke  13:33;  Acts  29:15)".  Almost 
(schedon).  Old  word,  but  in  N.T.  only  here,  Acts  19:26;  Heb. 
9:22.  fFas  gathered  together  (sunechthe) .  First  aorist  (effec- 
tive) passive  indicative  of  sunago,  old  and  common  verb. 
The  "whole  city"  could  hardly  all  gather  in  the  synagogue. 
Perhaps  Paul  spoke  in  the  synagogue  and  Barnabas  to  the 
overflow  outside  (see  verse  46).  It  was  an  eager  and  earnest 
gathering  "to  hear  (akousai,  first  aorist  active  infinitive  of 
purpose)  the  word  of  God  "  and  a  great  opportunity  for  Paul 
and  Barnabas.  The  Codex  Bezae  has  it  "to  hear  Paul." 
It  was  the  new  preacher  (Paul)  that  drew  the  big  crowd. 
It  was  a  crowd  such  as  will  later  hang  on  the  words  of  John 
Wesley  and  George  Whitfield  when  they  preach  Jesus  Christ. 

45.  The  Jews  {hoi  loudaioi).  Certainly  not  the  proselytes 
of  verse  43.  Probably  many  of  the  Jews  that  were  then 
favourably  disposed  to  Paul's  message  had  reacted  against 
him  under  the  influence  of  the  rabbis  during  the  week  and 
evidently  on  this  Sabbath  very  many  Gentiles  ("almost  the 
whole  city,"  "the  multitudes"  tous  ochlous)  had  gathered, 
to  the  disgust  of  the  stricter  Jews.  Nothing  is  specifically 
stated  here  about  the  rabbis,  but  they  were  beyond  doubt 
the  instigators  of,  and  the  ringleaders  in,  the  opposition  as 
in  Thessalonica  (17:5).  No  such  crowds  {ochlous)  came  to 
the  synagogue  when  they  were  the  speakers.  With  jealousy 
(zelou).  Genitive  case  of  zelos  (from  zeo,  to  boil)  after  eples- 
thesan  (effective  first  aorist  passive  indicative  of  pimplemi). 
Envy  and  jealousy  arise  between  people  of  the  same  calling 


198      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

(doctors  towards  doctors,  lawyers  towards  lawyers,  preachers 
towards  preachers).  So  these  rabbis  boiled  with  jealousy 
when  they  saw  the  crowds  gathered  to  hear  Paul  and  Bar- 
nabas. Contradicted  {antelegon).  Imperfect  active  of  antilego, 
old  verb  to  speak  against,  to  say  a  word  in  opposition  to 
(anti,  face  to  face).  It  was  interruption  of  the  service  and 
open  opposition  in  the  public  meeting.  Paul  and  Barnabas 
were  guests  by  courtesy  and,  of  course,  could  not  proceed 
further,  when  denied  that  privilege.  Blasphemed  {hlasphe- 
mountes).  Blaspheming.  So  the  correct  text  without  the 
addition  antilegontes  (repeated  from  antelegon  above).  Com- 
mon verb  in  the  Gospels  for  saying  injurious  and  harmful 
things.  Doubtless  these  rabbis  indulged  in  unkind  personal- 
ities and  made  it  plain  that  Paul  and  Barnabas  were  going 
beyond  the  limitations  of  pure  Judaism  in  their  contacts 
with  Gentiles. 

46.  Spake  out  boldly  {parresiasamenoi).  First  aorist  mid- 
dle participle  of  parresiazomai,  to  use  freedom  in  speaking, 
to  assume  boldness.  Both  Paul  and  Barnabas  accepted  the 
challenge  of  the  rabbis.  They  would  leave  their  synagogue, 
but  not  without  a  word  of  explanation.  It  was  necessary  to 
you  first  {Humin  en  anagkaion  proton).  They  had  done  their 
duty  and  had  followed  the  command  of  Jesus  (1:8).  They 
use  the  very  language  of  Peter  in  3:26  {humin  proton)  "to 
you  first."  This  position  Paul  as  the  apostle  to  the  Gentiles 
will  always  hold,  the  Jew  first  in  privilege  and  penalty  (Rom. 
1:16;  2:9  and  10).  Ye  thrust  it  from  you  {apotheisthe  auton). 
Present  middle  (indirect,  from  yourselves)  indicative  of 
apdtheo,  to  push  from.  Vigorous  verb  seen  already  in  Acts 
7:27,  39  which  see.  Judge  yourselves  unworthy  (ouk  axious 
krinete  heautous).  Present  active  indicative  of  the  common 
verb  krinOj  to  judge  or  decide  with  the  reflexive  pronoun 
expressed.  Literally,  Do  not  judge  yourselves  worthy.  By 
their  action  and  their  words  they  had  taken  a  violent  and 
definite  stand.    Lo,  we  turn  to  the  Gentiles  {idou  strephometha 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  199 

eis  ta  ethne).  It  is  a  crisis  {idou^  lo):  "Lo,  we  turn  ourselves 
to  the  Gentiles."  Probably  also  aoristic  present,  we  now 
turn  (Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  864-70).  Strephometha  is 
probably  the  direct  middle  (Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  806- 
08)  though  the  aorist  passive  estraphen  is  so  used  also  (7:39). 
It  is  a  dramatic  moment  as  Paul  and  Barnabas  turn  from 
the  Jews  to  the  Gentiles,  a  prophecy  of  the  future  history  of 
Christianity.  In  Rom.  9  to  1 1  Paul  will  discuss  at  length  the 
rejection  of  Christ  by  the  Jews  and  the  calling  of  the  Gen- 
tiles to  be  the  real  (the  spiritual)  Israel. 

47.  For  so  hath  the  Lord  commanded  us  (houtos  gar  ente- 
taltai  hemin  ho  kurios).  Perfect  middle  indicative  of  entello, 
poetic  (Pindar)  and  late  verb  to  enjoin  (1:2).  The  command 
of  the  Lord  Paul  finds  in  Isa.  49:6  quoted  by  Simeon  also 
(Luke  2:32).  The  conviction  of  Paul's  mind  was  now  made 
clear  by  the  fact  of  the  rejection  by  the  Jews.  He  could  now 
see  more  clearly  the  words  of  the  prophet  about  the  Gen- 
tiles: The  Messiah  is  declared  by  God  in  Isaiah  to  be  "a 
light  to  the  Gentiles"  (ethndn,  objective  genitive),  "a  light 
for  revelation  to  the  Gentiles"  {phos  eis  apokalupsin  ethnon, 
Luke  2:32).  So  Paul  is  carrying  out  the  will  of  God  in  turn- 
ing to  the  Gentiles.  He  will  still  appeal  to  the  Jews  else- 
where as  they  allow  him  to  do  so,  but  not  here.  That  thou 
shouldest  be  (tou  einai  se).  Genitive  articular  infinitive  of 
purpose  with  the  accusative  of  general  reference.  This  is 
all  according  to  God's  fixed  purpose  {tetheika,  perfect  active 
indicative  of  tithemi).  Unto  the  uttermost  part  of  the  earth 
{he OS  eschatou  tes  ges).  Unto  the  last  portion  (genitive 
neuter,  not  feminine)  of  the  earth.  It  is  a  long  time  from 
Paul  to  now,  not  to  say  from  Isaiah  to  now,  and  not  yet 
has  the  gospel  been  carried  to  half  of  the  people  of  earth. 
God's  people  are  slow  in  carrying  out  God's  plans  for  salva- 
tion. 

48.  As  the  Gentiles  heard  this  they  were  glad  {akouonta  ta 
ethne  echairon).    Present  active  participle  of  akoud  and  im- 


200      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

perfect  active  of  chairo,  linear  action  descriptive  of  the  joy 
of  the  Gentiles.  Glorified  the  word  of  God  {edoxazon  ton  logon 
tou  theou).  Imperfect  active  again.  The  joy  of  the  Gentiles 
increased  the  fury  of  the  Jews.  "The  synagogue  became  a 
scene  of  excitement  which  must  have  been  something  like 
the  original  speaking  with  tongues"  (Rackham).  The  joy 
of  the  Gentiles  was  to  see  how  they  could  receive  the  higher 
blessing  of  Judaism  without  circumcision  and  other  repel- 
lent features  of  Jewish  ceremonialism.  It  was  the  gospel  of 
grace  and  liberty  from  legalism  that  Paul  had  proclaimed. 
Whether  Gal.  4:13  describes  this  incident  or  not  (the  South 
Galatian  theory),  it  illustrates  it  when  Gentiles  received 
Paul  as  if  he  were  Christ  Jesus  himself.  It  was  triumph  with 
the  Gentiles,  but  defeat  with  the  Jews.  As  many  as  were 
ordained  to  eternal  life  {hosoi  esan  tetagmenoi  eis  zoen  aio- 
nion).  Periphrastic  past  perfect  passive  indicative  of  tassb, 
a  military  term  to  place  in  orderly  arrangement.  The  word 
"ordain"  is  not  the  best  translation  here.  "Appointed,"  as 
Hackett  shows,  is  better.  The  Jews  here  had  voluntarily 
rejected  the  word  of  God.  On  the  other  side  were  those 
Gentiles  who  gladly  accepted  what  the  Jews  had  rejected, 
not  all  the  Gentiles.  Why  these  Gentiles  here  ranged  them- 
selves on  God's  side  as  opposed  to  the  Jews  Luke  does  not 
tell  us.  This  verse  does  not  solve  the  vexed  problem  of 
divine  sovereignty  and  human  free  agency.  There  is  no 
evidence  that  Luke  had  in  mind  an  absolutum  decretum  of 
personal  salvation.  Paul  had  shown  that  God's  plan  ex- 
tended to  and  included  Gentiles.  Certainly  the  Spirit  of 
God  does  move  upon  the  human  heart  to  which  some  re- 
spond, as  here,  while  others  push  him  away.  Believed  (epis- 
teusan).  Summary  or  constative  first  aorist  active  indicative 
of  pisteuo.  The  subject  of  this  verb  is  the  relative  clause. 
By  no  manner  of  legerdemain  can  it  be  made  to  mean 
"those  who  believe  were  appointed."  It  was  saving  faith 
that  was  exercised  only  by  those  who  were  appointed  unto 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  20I 

eternal  life,  who  were  ranged  on  I'h^  sjrlp  of  pternal  life,  who 
were  thus  revealed  as  the  subjects  of  God's  grace  by  the 
stand  that  they  took  on  this  day  for  the  Lord.  It  was  a 
great  day  for  the  kingdom  of  God. 

49.  Was  spread  abroad  (diephereto) .  Imperfect  passive  of 
diaphero,  to  carry  in  different  directions  {dia).  By  the  recent 
converts  as  well  as  by  Paul  and  Barnabas.  This  would  seem 
to  indicate  a  stay  of  some  months  with  active  work  among 
the  Gentiles  that  bore  rich  fruit.  Throughout  all  the  region 
{dV  holes  tes  choras).  Antioch  in  Pisidia  as  a  Roman  colony 
would  be  the  natural  centre  of  a  Roman  Regio,  an  important 
element  in  Roman  imperial  administration.  There  were 
probably  other  Regiones  in  South  Galatia  (Ramsay,  St.  Paul 
the  Traveller  and  Roman  Citizen,  pp.  102-12). 

50.  Urged  on  (parotrunan).  First  aorist  (effective)  active 
of  par-otruno,  old  verb,  but  here  alone  in  the  N.T.,  to  incite, 
to  stir  up.  The  Jews  were  apparently  not  numerous  in  this 
city  as  they  had  only  one  synagogue,  but  they  had  influence 
with  people  of  prominence,  like  "the  devout  women  of 
honourable  estate"  {tas  sebomenas  gunaikas  tas  eusche- 
monas),  the  female  proselytes  of  high  station,  a  late  use  of 
an  old  word  used  about  Joseph  of  Arimathea  (Mark  15:43). 
The  rabbis  went  after  these  Gentile  women  who  had  em- 
braced Judaism  (cf.  Acts  17:4  in  Thessalonica)  as  Paul 
had  made  an  appeal  to  them.  The  prominence  of  women  in 
public  life  here  at  Antioch  is  quite  in  accord  with  what  we 
know  of  conditions  in  the  cities  of  Asia  Minor.  "Thus 
women  were  appointed  under  the  empire  as  magistrates,  as 
presidents  of  the  games,  and  even  the  Jews  elected  a  woman 
as  Archisynagogos,  at  least  in  one  instance  at  Smyrna" 
(Knowling).  In  Damascus  Josephus  (War  II.  20,  21)  says 
that  a  majority  of  the  married  women  were  proselytes. 
Strabo  (VIII.  2)  and  Juvenal  (VI.  542)  speak  of  the  addic- 
tion of  women  to  the  Jewish  religion.  The  chief  men  of  the 
city  {tous  protons  tes   poleos).     Probably  city  officials  (the 


202      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Duumviri,  the  Praetors,  the  First  Ten  in  the  Greek  Cities 
of  the  east)  or  other  "foremost"  men,  not  officials.  The 
rabbis  were  shrewd  enough  to  reach  these  men  (not  prose- 
lytes) through  the  women  who  were  proselytes  of  distinction. 
Stirred  up  a  persecution  {epegeiran  diogmon).  First  aorist 
active  indicative  of  epegeiro,  old  verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only 
here  and  14:2.  Paul  seems  to  allude  to  this  persecution  in 
II  Tim.  3:11  "persecutions,  sufferings,  what  things  befell 
me  at  Antioch,  at  Iconium,  at  Lystra,  what  persecutions  I 
endured."  Here  Paul  had  perils  from  his  own  countrymen 
and  perils  from  the  Gentiles  after  the  perils  of  rivers  and 
perils  of  robbers  on  the  way  from  Perga  (II  Cor.  11:26). 
He  was  thrice  beaten  with  rods  {tris  erhahdisthen,  II  Cor. 
11:25)  by  Roman  lictors  in  some  Roman  colony.  If  that 
was  here,  then  Paul  and  Barnabas  were  publicly  scourged 
by  the  lictors  before  they  left.  Probably  the  Jews  succeeded 
in  making  the  Roman  officials  look  on  Paul  and  Barnabas 
as  disturbers  of  the  public  peace.  So  "they  cast  them  out 
of  their  borders"  {exebalon  autous  apo  ton  horion  auton). 
Second  aorist  active  indicative  of  ekballo,  forcible  expulsion 
plainly  as  public  nuisances.  Just  a  few  days  before  they 
were  the  heroes  of  the  city  and  now! 

51.  But  they  shook  off  the  dust  of  their  feet  against  them  {Hoi 
de  ektinaxamenoi  ton  koniorton  ton  podbn  ep*  autous).  First 
aorist  middle  (indirect)  participle  of  ektinasso,  to  shake  out  or 
off.  Homer  uses  it  for  knocking  out  teeth.  In  the  papyri.  The 
middle  aorist  participle  occurs  again  in  18:6  and  the  active 
imperative  with  the  dust  of  the  feet  in  Mark  6:11  (Luke 
10:1 1  has  apomassometha).  and  Matt.  10:14  (command  of 
Jesus).  It  is  a  dramatic  gesture  that  forbids  further  inter- 
course. "As  a  protest  against  the  injustice  which  cast  them 
out.  The  sandal  was  taken  off  and  the  dust  shaken  out  as  a 
symbolic  token  that  the  very  soil  of  the  country  was  defiling" 
(Fumeaux).  Unto  Iconium  (eis  Ikonion).  About  45  miles 
southeast  from  Antioch  in  Pisidia,  at  the  foot  of  the  Taurus 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  203 

mountains.  At  various  times  it  was  reckoned  also  in  Pisidia 
or  Phrygia  as  well  as  Lycaonia,  Phrygian  in  population  and 
distinguished  by  Luke  (Acts  14:6)  from  Lystra  and  Derbe, 
cities  of  Lycaonia.  As  compared  with  Antioch  (a  Roman 
colony)  it  was  a  native  Phrygian  town.  When  the  province 
of  Galatia  was  divided,  Iconium  became  the  capital  of  Ly- 
caonia and  eclipsed  Antioch  in  Pisidia.  Strictly  speaking  at 
this  time  Lystra  and  Derbe  were  cities  of  Lycaonia-Galatica 
while  Iconium  was  in  Phrygia-Galatica  (all  three  in  the 
Roman  Province  of  Galatia).  It  was  at  the  meeting  place  of 
several  Roman  roads  and  on  the  highway  from  east  to  west. 
It  is  still  a  large  town  Konieh  with  30,000  population. 

52.  And  the  disciples  {hoi  te  or  hoi  de  mathetai).  The  Gen- 
tile Christians  in  Antioch  in  Pisidia.  Persecution  had  pre- 
cisely the  opposite  effect  to  the  intention  of  the  Jews  for  they 
"were  filled  with  joy  and  the  Holy  Spirit"  {eplerounto 
char  as  kai  pneumatos  hagiou).  Imperfect  passive,  they  kept 
on  being  filled.  It  had  been  so  before  (Acts  4:31;  8:4;  9:31; 
12:24).  The  blood  of  the  martyrs  is  still  the  seed  of  the 
church. 


CHAPTER  XIV 

1.  They  entered  together  {kata  to  auto  eiselthein).  Like 
epi  to  auto  in  3:1.  The  infinitive  eiselthein  is  the  subject  of 
egeneto.  So  spake  that  (lalesai  houtos  hoste).  Infinitive  again 
parallel  to  eiselthein.  With  the  result  that,  actual  result  here 
stated  with  hoste  and  the  aorist  infinitive  pisteusai  (Robert- 
son, Grammar,  pp.  999f.)  rather  than  hoste  and  the  indicative 
like  John  3:16.    It  was  a  tremendous  first  meeting. 

2.  That  were  disobedient  (hoi  apeithes antes).  First  aorist 
active  articular  participle,  not  the  present  apeithountes  as  the 
Textus  Receptus  has  it.  But  the  meaning  is  probably  the 
Jews  that  disbelieved,  rather  than  that  disobeyed.  Strictly 
apeitheo  does  mean  to  disobey  and  apisteo  to  disbelieve,  but 
that  distinction  is  not  observed  in  John  3 136  nor  in  Acts  19:9 
and  28:24.  The  word  apeitheo  means  to  be  apeithes,  to  be  un- 
willing to  be  persuaded  or  to  withhold  belief  and  then  also 
to  withhold  obedience.  The  two  meanings  run  into  one  an- 
other. To  disbelieve  the  word  of  God  is  to  disobey  God. 
Made  them  evil  affected  (ekakosan).  First  aorist  active  in- 
dicative of  kakoo,  old  verb  from  kakos,  to  do  evil  to,  to  ill- 
treat,  then  in  later  Greek  as  here  to  embitter,  to  exasperate 
as  in  Psa.  105:32  and  in  Josephus.  In  this  sense  only  here  in 
the  N.T.  Evidently  Paul  preached  the  same  message  as  in 
Antioch  for  it  won  both  Jews  and  Gentiles,  and  displeased 
the  rabbis.  Codex  Bezae  adds  here  that  "the  chiefs  of  the 
synagogue  and  the  rulers"  brought  persecution  upon  Paul 
and  Barnabas  just  as  was  argued  about  Antioch.  Outside  the 
synagogue  the  Jews  would  poison  the  minds  of  the  Gentiles 
against  Paul  and  Barnabas.  "The  story  of  Thecla  suggests 
a  means,  and  perhaps  the  apostles  were  brought  before  the 
magistrates  on  some  charge  of  interference  with  family  life. 

104 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  205 

The  magistrates  however  must  have  seen  at  once  that  there 
was  no  legal  case  against  them;  and  by  a  sentence  of  acquit- 
tal or  in  some  other  way  the  Lord  gave  peace"  (Rackham). 
As  we  have  it,  the  story  of  Paul  and  Thecla  undoubtedly 
has  apocryphal  features,  though  Thecla  may  very  well  be  an 
historical  character  here  at  Iconium  where  the  story  is  lo- 
cated. Certainly  the  picture  of  Paul  herein  drawn  cannot 
be  considered  authentic  though  a  true  tradition  may  under- 
lie it:  "bald,  bowlegged,  strongly  built,  small  in  stature,  with 
large  eyes  and  meeting  eyebrows  and  longish  nose;  full  of 
grace;  sometimes  looking  like  a  man,  sometimes  having  the 
face  of  an  angel." 

3.  Long  time  therefore  {hikanon  men  oun  chronon).  Accusa- 
tive of  duration  of  time  (possibly  six  months)  and  note 
men  oun.  There  is  an  antithesis  in  eschisthe  de  (verse  4)  and 
in  verse  5  (egeneto  de).  After  the  persecution  and  vindica- 
tion there  was  a  season  of  great  opportunity  which  Paul  and 
Barnabas  used  to  the  full,  "speaking  boldly"  (parresiazo- 
menoi  as  in  13:46  at  Antioch  in  Pisidia,  "in  the  Lord"  {epi 
toi  kurioi),  upon  the  basis  of  the  Lord  Jesus  as  in  4:i7f. 
And  the  Lord  Jesus  "bore  witness  to  the  word  of  his  grace" 
as  he  always  does,  "granting  signs  and  wonders  to  be  done 
by  their  hands"  {didonti  semeia  kai  terata  ginesthai  dia  ton 
cheiron  anion).  Present  participle  (didonti)  and  present 
infinitive  (ginesthai)  repetition  of  both  signs  and  wonders 
(note  both  words)  just  as  had  happened  with  Peter  and  John 
and  the  other  apostles  (2:43;  4:29^ ;  5:12;  cf.  Heb.  2:4).  The 
time  of  peace  could  not  last  forever  with  such  a  work  of 
grace  as  this.  A  second  explosion  of  persecution  was  bound 
to  come  and  some  of  the  MSS.  actually  have  ek  deuterou 
(a  second  time). 

4.  But  the  multitude  of  the  city  was  divided  (eschisthe  de 
to  plethos  tes  polebs).  First  aorist  passive  indicative  of 
schizo,  old  verb  to  split,  to  make  a  schism  or  factions  as  Sad- 
ducees  and  Pharisees  (23:7).    This  division  was  within  the 


2o6      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Gentile  populace.  Part  held  {hoi  men  esan)^  literally  "some 
were  with  the  Jews"  {sun  tois  loudaiois),  part  with  the 
apostles  {hoi  de  sun  tois  apostolois).  Common  demonstrative 
of  contrast  {hoi  men^  hoi  de,  Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  694). 
The  Jewish  leaders  made  some  impression  on  the  Gentiles  as 
at  Antioch  in  Pisidia  and  later  at  Thessalonica  {i'j:/\.{.).  This 
is  the  first  time  in  the  Acts  that  Paul  and  Barnabas  are 
termed  "apostles"  (see  also  verse  14).  Elsewhere  in  the 
Acts  the  word  is  restricted  to  the  twelve.  Certainly  Luke 
does  not  here  employ  it  in  that  technical  sense.  To  have 
followed  Jesus  in  his  ministry  and  to  have  seen  the  Risen 
Christ  was  essential  to  the  technical  use  (i:22f.).  Whether 
Barnabas  had  seen  the  Risen  Christ  we  do  not  know,  but 
certainly  Paul  had  (I  Cor.  9:if.;  15:8).  Paul  claimed  to  be 
an  apostle  on  a  par  with  the  twelve  (Gal.  1:1,  16-18).  The 
word  originally  means  simply  one  sent  (John  13:16)  like 
messengers  of  the  churches  with  the  collection  (II  Cor.  8:23). 
The  Jews  used  it  of  those  sent  from  Jerusalem  to  collect  the 
temple  tribute.  Paul  applies  the  word  to  James  the  Lord's 
brother  (Gal.  1:19),  to  Epaphroditus  (Phil.  2:25)  as  the 
messenger  of  the  church  in  Philippi,  to  Silvanus  and  Timothy 
(I  Thess.  2:6;  Acts  18:5),  apparently  to  Apollos  (I  Cor. 
4:9),  and  to  Andronicus  and  Junias  (Rom.  i6:6f.).  He  even 
calls  the  Judaizers  "false  apostles"  (II  Cor.  11:13). 

5.  An  onset  {horme).  A  rush  or  impulse  as  in  James  3:4. 
Old  word,  but  only  twice  in  the  N.T.  (here  and  James).  It 
probably  denotes  not  an  actual  attack  so  much  as  the  open 
start,  the  co-operation  of  both  Jews  and  Gentiles  (the  dis- 
affected portion),  "with  their  rulers"  {sun  tois  archousin 
autdn)y  that  is  the  rulers  of  the  Jewish  synagogue  (13:27). 
The  city  officials  would  hardly  join  in  a  mob  like  this,  though 
Hackett  and  Rackham  think  that  the  city  magistrates  were 
also  involved  as  in  Antioch  in  Pisidia  (13:50).  To  entreat 
them  shamefully  {hubrisai).  First  aorist  active  infinitive  of 
hubrizd,  old  verb  to  insult  insolently.  See  on  Matt.   22:6; 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  207 

Luke  18:32.  To  stone  {lithobolesai).  First  aorist  active  in- 
finitive of  lithoboleo,  late  verb  from  lithobolos  (lithos,  stone, 
ballo,  to  throw)  to  pelt  with  stones,  the  verb  used  of  the 
stoning  of  Stephen  (7:58).  See  on  Matt.  21:35.  The  plan 
to  stone  them  shows  that  the  Jews  were  in  the  lead  and 
followed  by  the  Gentile  rabble.  "Legal  proceedings  having 
failed  the  only  resource  left  for  the  Jews  was  illegal  violence" 
(Rackham). 

6.  They  became  aware  of  it  (sunidontes) .  Second  aorist 
(ingressive)  active  participle  of  sunorao  (suneidon),  old  word 
to  see  together,  to  become  conscious  of  as  already  in  12:12. 
In  the  N.T.  only  by  Luke  and  Paul.  Fled  (katephugon). 
Second  aorist  (effective)  active  indicative  of  katapheugo,  old 
verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Heb.  6:18.  Paul  and 
Barnabas  had  no  idea  of  remaining  to  be  stoned  (lynched)  by 
this  mob.  It  is  a  wise  preacher  who  always  knows  when  to 
stand  his  ground  and  when  to  leave  for  the  glory  of  God. 
Paul  and  Barnabas  were  following  the  directions  of  the  Lord 
Jesus  given  to  the  twelve  on  their  special  tour  of  Galilee 
(Matt.  10:23).  Lystra  and  Derbe,  cities  of  Lycaonia  (still 
part  of  the  Province  of  Galatia,  though  in  another  Regio)^ 
not  far  from  the  base  of  the  Black  Mountain.  Professor 
Sterrett  has  apparently  identified  Lystra  by  an  inscription 
about  six  hours  (18  miles)  south-southwest  from  Iconium 
near  the  village  Khatyn  Serai  and  Derbe  probably  near  the 
village  Losta  or  Zosta  though  its  location  is  really  not  known. 
Lystra  had  been  made  a  colony  in  B.C.  6  and  Derbe  was  the 
frontier  city  of  the  Roman  empire  in  the  southeast.  These 
are  the  only  cities  mentioned,  but  they  were  of  importance 
and  show  that  Paul  kept  to  his  plan  of  going  to  centres  of 
influence.  The  new  imperial  road  from  Antioch  and  Iconium 
reached  these  cities.  The  region  round  about  {ten  perichoron) 
was  "a  high  table  land,  ill-watered,  bleak,  but  suited  for 
sheep  pasture"  (Page). 

7.  And  there  they  preached  the  gospel  {k'akei  euaggelizomenoi

esan).  Periphrastic  imperfect  middle.  We  are  to  think  of 
extensive  evangelistic  work  perhaps  with  the  assistance  of 
disciples  from  Antioch  and  Iconium  since  Paul  and  Barnabas 
could  not  speak  Lycaonian.   K'akei  is  crasis  for  kai  ekei. 

8.  At  Lystra  {en  Lustrois).  Neuter  plural  as  in  16:2;  II 
Tim.  3:11  while  feminine  singular  in  14:6,  21;  i6:i.  There 
was  apparently  no  synagogue  in  Lystra  and  so  not  many 
Jews.  Paul  and  Barnabas  had  to  do  open-air  preaching  and 
probably  had  difficulty  in  being  understood  by  the  natives 
though  both  Greek  and  Latin  inscriptions  were  discovered 
here  by  Professor  Sterrett  in  1885.  The  incident  narrated 
here  (verses  8-18)  shows  how  they  got  a  real  hearing  among 
these  rude  heathen.  There  sat  (ekatheto).  Imperfect  middle 
of  kathemai.  Was  sitting.  This  case  is  very  much  like 
that  in  3:1-11,  healed  by  Peter.  Possibly  outside  the  gate 
(verse  13)  or  some  public  place.  Impotent  in  his  feet  {aduna- 
tos  tois  posin).  Old  verbal,  but  only  here  in  the  N.T.  in  this 
sense  except  figuratively  in  Rom.  15:1.  Elsewhere  it  means 
"impossible"  (Matt.  19:26).  Locative  case.  Common  in 
medical  writers  in  the  sense  of  "impotent."  So  Tobit  2:10; 
5:9.  Had  walked  (periepatesen).  So  best  MSS.,  first  aorist 
active  indicative  "walked,"  not  periepepatekei,  "had 
walked"  (past  perfect  active). 

9.  The  same  (houtos).  Just  "this  one."  Heard  (ekouen). 
Imperfect  active,  was  listening  to  Paul  speaking  {lalountos). 
Either  at  the  gate  or  in  the  market  place  (17:17)  Paul  was 
preaching  to  such  as  would  listen  or  could  understand  his 
Greek  {Koine).  Ramsay  {St.  Paul  the  Traveller ^  pp.  114,  116) 
thinks  that  the  cripple  was  a  proselyte.  At  any  rate  he  may 
have  heard  of  the  miracles  wrought  at  Iconium  (verse  3)  and 
Paul  may  have  spoken  of  the  work  of  healing  wrought  by 
Jesus.  This  man  was  "no  mendicant  pretender,"  for  his 
history  was  known  from  his  birth.  Fastening  his  eyes  upon 
him  {atenisas  autoi).  Just  as  in  13:9  of  Paul  and  1:10  which 
see.  Paul  saw  a  new  hope  in  the  man's  eyes  and  face.  He  had 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  209 

faith  (echei  pistin).  Present  active  indicative  retained  in 
indirect  discourse.  To  be  made  whole  (tou  sothenai).  Genitive 
of  articular  first  aorist  passive  infinitive  (purpose  and  result 
combined)  of  J020,  to  make  sound  and  also  to  save.  Here 
clearly  to  make  whole  or  well  as  in  Luke  7:50  (cf.  Acts  3  :i6; 

4:10)- 

10.  Upright  (orthos).  Predicate  adjective.  In  this  sense 
Galen  and  Hippocrates  frequently  use  orthos  (erect,  straight). 
Paul  spoke  in  a  loud  (megalei)  voice  so  that  all  could  hear  and 
know.  He  leaped  up  and  walked  {helato  kaiperiepatei).  Rather, 
He  leaped  up  with  a  single  bound  and  began  to  walk.  The 
second  aorist  middle  indicative  (with  first  aorist  vowel  a)  of 
hallomai  (late  verb,  in  papyri)  and  inchoative  imperfect 
active  of  peripateo,  common  verb  to  walk  around.  This 
graphic  picture  is  concealed  by  the  usual  English  rendering. 
It  is  possible  that  Luke  obtained  the  vivid  report  of  this 
incident  from  Timothy  who  may  have  witnessed  it  and  who 
was  probably  converted  during  Paul's  stay  here  (16:3). 
His  father  was  a  prominent  Greek  and  his  mother  Eunice, 
possibly  a  widow,  may  have  lived  here  with  her  mother 
Lois  (II  Tim.  1:5). 

11.  Lifted  up  their  voice  (eperan  ten  phonen  auton). 
First  aorist  active  of  epairo.  In  their  excitement  they 
elevated  their  voices.  In  the  speech  of  Lycaonia  (Lukaonisti). 
Adverb  from  verb  lukaonizo,  to  use  the  language  of  Lycaonia 
found  here  alone,  but  formed  regularly  like  Ebraisti  (John 
5:2),  Hellenisti  (Acts  21:37),  Romaisti  (John  19:20).  Paul 
was  speaking  in  Greek,  of  course,  but  the  excitement  of  the 
crowd  over  the  miracle  made  them  cry  out  in  their  native 
tongue  which  Paul  and  Barnabas  did  not  understand.  Hence 
it  was  not  till  preparations  for  offering  sacrifice  to  them  had 
begun  that  Paul  understood  the  new  role  in  which  he  and 
Barnabas  were  held.  In  the  likeness  of  men  (homoiothentes 
anthropois).  First  aorist  passive  participle  of  homoioj  to 
liken,  with  the  associative  instrumental  case.  In  this  primitive

state  the  people  hold  to  the  old  Graeco-Roman  mythology. 
The  story  of  Baucis  and  Philemon  tells  how  Jupiter  (Zeus) 
and  Mercury  (Hermes)  visited  in  human  form  the  neighbour- 
ing region  of  Phrygia  (Ovid,  Meta.  VIII.  626).  Jupiter  (Zeus) 
had  a  temple  in  Lystra. 

12.  They  called  {ekaloun).  Inchoative  imperfect  began  to 
call.  Barnabas,  Jupiter  {ton  Barnaban  Dia).  Because  Barna- 
bas was  the  older  and  the  more  imposing  in  appearance. 
Paul  admits  that  he  was  not  impressive  in  looks  (II  Cor. 
10:10).  And  Paul,  Mercury  {ton  de  Paulon  Hermen).  Mercury 
{Hermes)  was  the  messenger  of  the  gods,  and  the  spokesman 
of  Zeus.  Hermes  was  of  beautiful  appearance  and  eloquent 
in  speech,  the  inventor  of  speech  in  legend.  Our  word  her- 
meneutlcs  or  science  of  interpretation  comes  from  this  word 
(Heb.  7:2;  John  1:38).  Because  he  was  the  chief  speaker 
{epeide  autos  en  ho  hegoumenos  tou  logou).  Paul  was  clearly 
"the  leader  of  the  talk."  So  it  seemed  a  clear  case  to  the 
natives.  If  preachers  always  knew  what  people  really  think 
of  them!  Whether  Paul  was  alluding  to  his  experience  in 
Lystra  or  not  in  Gal.  4:14,  certainly  they  did  receive  him  as 
an  angel  of  God,  as  if  "Mercury"  in  reality. 

13.  Whose  temple  was  before  the  city  {tou  ontos  pro  tes 
pbleos).  The  god  (Zeus)  is  identified  with  his  temple.  He  had 
a  statue  and  temple  there.  Oxen  and  garlands  {taurous  kai 
stemmata).  Probably  garlands  to  put  on  the  oxen  before 
they  were  slain.  It  was  common  to  sacrifice  bullocks  to 
Jupiter  and  Mercury.  Would  have  done  sacrifice  {ethelen 
thuein).  Imperfect  indicative,  wanted  to  offer  sacrifice.  He 
was  planning  to  do  it,  and  his  purpose  now  became  plain  to 
Paul  and  Barnabas. 

14.  Having  heard  {akousantes).  Such  elaborate  prepara- 
tion "with  the  multitudes"  {sun  tois  ochlois)  spread  rumours 
and  some  who  spoke  Greek  told  Paul  and  Barnabas.  It  is 
possible  that  the  priest  of  Jupiter  may  have  sent  a  formal 
request  that  the  visiting  "gods"  might  come  out  to  the 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  21 1 

statue  by  the  temple  gates  to  make  it  a  grand  occasion. 
They  rent  their  garments  (diarrexantes) .  First  aorist  active 
participle  from  diarregnumi,  old  verb  to  rend  in  two.  Like 
the  high  priest  in  Matt.  26:65  ^^  if  an  act  of  sacrilege  was 
about  to  be  committed.  It  was  strange  conduct  for  the  sup- 
posed gods!  Sprang  forth  (exepedesan).  First  aorist  (ingres- 
sive)  active  indicative  of  ekpedad  (note  ek),  old  verb,  here 
only  in  the  N.T.  It  was  all  a  sign  of  grief  and  horror  with 
loud  outcries  (krazontes). 

15.  Sirs  (andres).  Literally,  Men.  Abrupt,  but  courteous. 
We  also  are  men  of  like  passions  with  you  (kai  hemeis  hom- 
oiopatheis  esmen  humin  anthropoi).  Old  adjective  from  hom- 
oios  (like)  and  pascho,  to  experience.  In  the  N.T.  only  here 
and  James  5:17.  It  means  "of  like  nature"  more  exactly 
and  affected  by  like  sensations,  not  "gods"  at  all.  Their 
conduct  was  more  serious  than  the  obeisance  of  Cornelius 
to  Peter  (io:25f.).  Humin  is  associative  instrumental  case. 
And  bring  you  good  tidings  {euaggelizomenoi) .  No  "and"  in 
the  Greek,  just  the  present  middle  participle,  "gospelizing 
you."  They  are  not  gods,  but  evangelists.  Here  we  have 
Paul's  message  to  a  pagan  audience  without  the  Jewish 
environment  and  he  makes  the  same  line  of  argument  seen 
in  Acts  17:21-32  and  Rom.  1:18-23.  At  Antioch  in  Pisidia 
we  saw  Paul's  line  of  approach  to  Jews  and  proselytes 
(Acts  13:16-41).  That  ye  should  turn  from  these  vain  things 
{apo  toutbn  ton  mataion  epistrephein) .  He  boldly  calls  the 
worship  of  Jupiter  and  Mercury  and  all  idols  "vain"  or 
empty  things,  pointing  to  the  statues  and  the  temple. 
Unto  the  living  God  {epi  theon  zonta).  They  must  go  the 
whole  way.  Our  God  is  a  live  God,  not  a  dead  statue.  Paul 
is  fond  of  this  phrase  (II  Cor.  6:16;  Rom.  9:26).  Who  made 
{hos  epoiesen).  The  one  God  is  alive  and  is  the  Creator  of  the 
Universe  just  as  Paul  will  argue  in  Athens  (Acts  17:24).  Paul 
here  quotes  Psa.  146:6  and  has  Gen.  1:1  in  mind.  See  also 
I  Thess.  1 :9  where  a  new  allegiance  is  also  claimed  as  here. 


212      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

1 6.  In  the  generations  gone  by  {en  tais  paroichemenais 
geneais).  Perfect  middle  participle  from  paroichomai,  to  go 
by,  old  verb,  here  alone  in  the  N.T.  Suffered  (eiasen).  Con- 
stative  aorist  active  indicative  of  eao  (note  syllabic  aug- 
ment). Paul  here  touches  God  in  history  as  he  did  just  be- 
fore in  creation.  God's  hand  is  on  the  history  of  all  the 
nations  (Gentile  and  Jew),  only  with  the  Gentiles  he  with- 
drew the  restraints  of  his  grace  in  large  measure  (Acts  17:30; 
Rom.  1:24,  26,  28),  judgment  enough  for  their  sins.  To  walk 
in  their  ways  {poreuesthai  tais  hodois  auton).  Present  middle 
infinitive,  to  go  on  walking,  with  locative  case  without  en. 
This  philosophy  of  history  does  not  mean  that  God  was 
ignorant  or  unconcerned.  He  was  biding  his  time  in  patience. 

17.  And  yet  {kaitoi).  Old  Greek  compound  particle  {kai 
toi).  In  the  N.T.  twice  only,  once  with  finite  verb  as  here, 
once  with  the  participle  (Heb.  4:3).  Without  witness  {amartu- 
ron).  Old  adjective  {a  privative  and  martus,  witness),  only 
here  in  the  N.T.  Left  {apheken).  First  aorist  active  {k 
aorist  indicative  of  aphiemi).  In  that  he  did  good  {agathour- 
gon).  Present  active  causal  participle  of  agathourgeo,  late 
and  rare  verb  (also  agathoergeo  I  Tim.  6:18),  reading  of  the 
oldest  MSB.  here  for  agathopoied^  to  do  good.  Note  two  other 
causal  participles  here  parallel  with  agathourgon,  viz.,  didous 
("giving  you")  present  active  of  didomi,  empiplon  (''fill- 
ing") present  active  of  empimplao  (late  form  of  empimplemi). 
This  witness  to  God  (his  doing  good,  giving  rains  and  fruit- 
ful seasons,  filling  your  hearts  with  food  and  gladness)  they 
could  receive  without  the  help  of  the  Old  Testament  revela- 
tion (Rom.  1:20).  Zeus  was  regar-ded_as-jJie_ggd_gf  rain 
(Jupiter  Pluvius)  and  Paul  claims  the  rain  and  the  fruitful 
{karpophorous,  karpos,  and  phero,  fruit  bearing,"~old~word, 
here  alone  in  N.T.)_seasons  as  coming  from  God.  Lycaonia 
was  often  dry  and  it  would  be  an  appropriate  item.  "Mer- 
cury, as  the  God  of  merchandise,  was  also  the  dispenser  of 
food"  (Vincent).    Paul  does  not  talk  about  laws  of  nature 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  21 3 

as  if  they  governed  themselves,  but  he  sees  the  Hvhig  God 
"behind  the  drama  of  the  physical  world"  (Furneaux). 
These  simple  country  people  could  grasp  his  ideas  as  he 
claims  eyerything_for  the  one  true  God.  Gladness  {euphro- 
sunes).  Old  word  from  euphron  {eu  and  phren)^  good  cheer. 
In  the  N.T.  only  Acts  2:28  and  here.  Cheerfulness  should 
be  our  normal  attitude  when  we  consider  God's  goodness,  i^ 
Paul  does  not  here  mention  Christ  because  he  had  the  single 
definite  purpose  to  dissuade  them  from  worshipping  Barna- 
bas and  himself. 

18.  Scarce  (molts).  Adverb  in  same  sense  as  old  mogisy 
from  moloSf  jQiL,  Restrained  {katepausan).  Effective  first 
aorist  active  indicative  of  katapauo,  old  verb  in  causative 
sense  to  make  abstain  from.  From  doing  sacrifice  unto  them 
{tou  me  thuein  autois).  Ablative  case  of  the  articular  infini- 
tive with  redundant  negative  after  katepausan^  regular 
Greek  idiom  (Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  1094,  1171).  It  had 
been  a  harrowing  and  well-nigh  a  horrible  ordeal,  but  finally 
Paul  had  won.    If  only  nobody  else  had  interposed! 

19.  But  there  came  thither  Jews  from  Antioch  and  Iconium 
(Epelthan  de  apo  Antiocheias  kai  Ikoniou  loudaioi).  Came 
to  or  upon  them,  epelthan,  second  aorist  (ingressive)  indica- 
tive of  eperchomai.  Whether  news  of  the  miracle  had  reached 
those  cities  we  do  not  know.  These  may  have  been  travel- 
ling grain  merchants.  At  any  rate  there  was  an  interval  in 
which  Paul  and  Barnabas  won  some  disciples  (verse  22). 
There  would  be  a  natural  reaction,  even  revulsion,  in  the 
minds  of  many  who  had  come  so  near  to  worshipping  Paul 
and  Barnabas.  The  pendulum  swings  easily  from  one  ex- 
treme to  the  other.  The  hostile  Jews  from  Antioch  and 
Iconium  may  even  have  followed  Paul  and  Barnabas  along 
the  fine  Roman  road  on  purpose  to  keep  them  on  the  run. 
They  had  driven  them  out  of  Antioch  and  out  of  Iconium 
and  now  appear  at  Lystra  at  an  opportune  moment  for  their 
work.     Having  persuaded  the  multitudes  (peisantes  tous  och-

lous).  First  aorist  (effective)  active  participle  of  peitho. 
They  had  complete  success  with  many  and  struck  at  the 
psychological  moment.  They  stoned  Paul  {lithasantes  ton 
Paulon).  First  aorist  active  participle  oi  lithazo,  late  verb 
from  lithos  for  throwing  stones  (used  by  Paul  referring  to 
this  one  incident  when  alone  he  was  stoned,  II  Cor.  11:25). 
The  wounds  inflicted  may  have  left  some  of  the  scars  {stig- 
mata) mentioned  in  Gal.  6:17.  They  stoned  Paul  as  the 
chief  speaker  (Mercu.ry)  and  passed  by  Barnabas  (Jupiter). 
It  was  a  Jewish  mode  of  punishment  as  against  Stephen  and 
these  Jews  knew  that  Paul  was  the  man  that  they  had  to 
deal  with.  Hackett  notes  that  the  Jews  with  two  exceptions 
incited  the  persecutions  which  Paul  endured.  The  excep- 
tions were  in  Philippi  (16:16-40)  and  Ephesus  (19:23-41). 
Dragged  him  out  of  the  city  {esuron  exo  tes  polebs).  They 
hurled  Stephen  outside  of  the  city  before  stoning  him  (7:58). 
It  was  a  hurried  and  irregular  proceeding,  but  they  were 
dragging  (imperfect  active  of  surd,  old  verb)  Paul  out  now. 
Supposing  that  he  were  dead  (nomizontes  auton  tethnekenai). 
Present  active  participle  with  infinitive  (second  perfect  ac- 
tive of  thnesko)  in  indirect  discourse  with  accusative  of 
general  reference.  The  Jews  are  jubilant  this  time  with 
memories  of  Paul's  escape  at  Antioch  and  Iconium.  The 
pagan  mob  feel  that  they  have  settled  accounts  for  their 
narrow  escape  from  worshipping  two  Jewish  renegade 
preachers.  It  was  a  good  day's  work  for  them  all.  Luke 
does  not  say  that  Paul  was  actually  dead. 

20.  Stood  round  about  him  {kuklosantbn  auton).  Genitive 
absolute  with  first  aorist  active  participle  of  kukloo,  old 
verb  from  kuklos  (circle,  cycle)  to  make  a  circle  round,  to 
encircle.  The  would-be  murderers  left  and  a  group  of  dis- 
ciples gathered  round  to  see  if  Paul  was  dead  or  alive  and, 
if  dead,  to  bury  him.  In  that  group  Timothy  may  very  well 
have  been  along  with  Eunice  and  Barnabas.  Timothy,  a  lad 
of  about  fifteen,  would  not  soon  forget  that  solemn  scene 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  215 

(II  Tim.  3:11).  But  Paul  suddenly  (apparently  a  miraculous 
recovery)  rose  up  (anastas)  and  entered  the  city  to  the  sur- 
prise and  joy  of  the  disciples  who  were  willing  to  brave 
persecution  with  Paul.  fVith  Barnabas  (sun  toi  Barnabdi). 
With  the  assistance  of  Barnabas.  It  was  plainly  unwise  to 
continue  in  Lystra  so  that  they  set  out  on  the  next  day  (tH 
epaurion,  ten  times  in  Acts),  shaken  and  bruised  as  Paul  was. 
Derbe  was  some  forty  miles  distant,  near  the  pass  to  the 
Cilician  Gates. 

21.  When  they  had  preached  the  gospel  to  that  city  {euag- 
gelisamenoi  ten  polin  ekeinen).  Having  evangelized  (first 
aorist  middle  participle)  that  city,  a  smaller  city  and  ap- 
parently with  no  trouble  from  the  Jews.  Had  made  many 
disciples  {matheteus antes  hikanous).  First  aorist  active 
participle  of  matheteud  from  mathetes,  a  learner  or  disciple. 
Late  verb  in  Plutarch,  to  be  a  disciple  (Matt.  27:57  like 
John  19:38)  and  then  to  disciple  (old  English,  Spenser),  to 
make  a  disciple  as  in  Matt.  28:19  and  here.  Paul  and  Barna- 
bas were  literally  here  obeying  the  command  of  Jesus  in 
discipling  people  in  this  heathen  city.  They  returned  to 
Lystra  and  to  Iconium,  and  to  Antioch  (hupestrepsan  eis  ten 
Lustran  kai  eis  Ikonion  kai  eis  Antiocheian) ,  Derbe  was 
the  frontier  city  of  the  Roman  empire.  The  quickest  way 
to  return  to  Antioch  in  Syria  would  have  been  by  the  Cilician 
Gates  or  by  the  pass  over  Mt.  Taurus  by  which  Paul  and 
Silas  will  come  to  Derbe  in  the  second  tour  (Acts  15:41-16: 
i),  but  difficult  to  travel  in  winter.  But  it  was  necessary 
to  revisit  the  churches  in  Lystra,  Iconium,  Antioch  in 
Pisidia  and  to  see  that  they  were  able  to  withstand  persecu- 
tion. Paul  was  a  Roman  citizen  though  he  had  not  made 
use  of  this  privilege  as  yet  for  his  own  protection.  Against 
mob  violence  it  would  count  for  little,  but  he  did  not  hesi- 
tate. Paul  had  been  stoned  in  Lystra,  threatened  in  Iconium, 
expelled  in  Antioch.  He  shows  his  wisdom  in  conserving 
his  work.

22.  Confirming  {episterizontes).  Late  verb  (in  LXX),  in 
N.T.  only  in  Acts  14:22;  15:32,  41,  to  make  more  firm,  to 
give  additional  {epi)  strength.  Each  time  in  Acts  the  word 
is  used  concerning  these  churches.  To  continue  in  the  faith 
{emmenein  tei  pistei).  To  remain  in  with  locative,  old  verb. 
It  is  possible  that  pistis  here  has  the  notion  of  creed  as  Paul 
uses  it  later  (Col.  i  :23  with  epimeno;  I  Tim.  5 :8).  It  seems  to 
be  here  more  than  trust  or  belief.  These  recent  converts 
from  heathenism  were  ill-informed,  were  persecuted,  had 
broken  family  and  social  ties,  greatly  needed  encouragement 
if  they  were  to  hold  out.  We  must  {dei  hemds).  It  does  not 
follow  from  this  use  of  "we"  that  Luke  was  present,  since 
it  is  a  general  proposition  applying  to  all  Christians  at  all 
times  (II  Tim.  3:12).  Luke,  of  course,  approved  this  princi- 
ple. Knowling  asks  why  Timothy  may  not  have  told  Luke 
about  Paul's  work.  It  all  sounds  like  quotation  of  Paul's 
very  language.  Note  the  change  of  construction  here  after 
parakalountes  (infinitive  of  indirect  command,  emmenein^ 
but  hoti  dei,  indirect  assertion).  They  needed  the  right 
understanding  of  persecution  as  we  all  do.  Paul  frankly 
warned  these  new  converts  in  this  heathen  environment 
of  the  many  tribulations  through  which  they  must  enter 
the  Kingdom  of  God  (the  culmination  at  last)  as  he  did  at 
Ephesus  (Acts  20:20)  and  as  Jesus  had  done  (John  16:33). 
These  saints  were  already  converted. 

23.  And  when  they  had  appointed  for  them  elders  in  every 
church  {cheirotones antes  de  autois  kat'  ekklesian  presbuterous). 
They  needed  also  some  form  of  organization,  though  already 
churches.  Note  distributive  use  of  kata  with  ekklesian 
(2:46;  5:42;  Titus  1:5).  Cheirotoneo  (from  cheirotonosy  ex- 
tending the  hand,  cheir,  hand,  and  teino,  to  stretch)  is  an  old 
verb  that  originally  meant  to  vote  by  show  of  the  hands, 
finally  to  appoint  with  the  approval  of  an  assembly  that 
chooses  as  in  II  Cor.  8:19,  and  then  to  appoint  without  re-  • 
gard  to  choice  as  In  Josephus  {Jnt.  XITL  2,  2)  of  the  ap-

pointment  of  Jonathan  as  high  priest  by  Alexander.  So  in 
Acts  10:41  the  compound  procheiratoneb  is  used  of  witnesses 
appointed  by  God.  But  the  seven  (deacons)  were  first 
selected  by  the  Jerusalem  church  and  then  appointed  ijka^ 
tastesomen)  by  the  apostles.  That  is  probably  the  plan 
contemplated  by  Paul  in  his  directions  to  Titus  (i  15)  about 
the  choice  of  elders.  It  is  most  likely  that  this  plan  was  the 
one  pursued  by  Paul  and  Barnabas  with  these  churches. 
They  selected  the  elders  in  each  instance  and  Paul  and 
Barnabas  "ordained"  them  as  we  say,  though  the  word 
cheirotoneo  does  not  mean  that.  "Elders"  were  mentioned 
first  in  1 1 130.  Later  Paul  will  give  the  requirements  expected 
in  these  "elders"  or  "bishops"  (Phil.  1:1)  as  in  I  Tim.  3; 
1-7;  Titus  1:5-9.  It  is  fairly  certain  that  these  elders  were 
chosen  to  correspond  in  a  general  way  with  the  elders  in 
the  Jewish  synagogue  after  which  the  local  church  was 
largely  copied  as  to  organization  and  worship.  Paul,  like 
Jesus,  constantly  worshipped  and  spoke  in  the  synagogues. 
Already  it  is  plain,  as  at  Antioch  in  Syria  (11:26),  that 
the  Christians  can  no  longer  count  on  the  use  of  the  Jewish 
synagogue.  They  must  have  an  organization  of  their  own. 
The  use  of  the  plural  here  implies  what  was  true  at  Philippi 
(Phil.  1:1)  and  Ephesus  (Acts  20:17,  28)  that  each  church 
(one  in  each  city)  "had  its  college  of  elders"  (Hackett)  as 
in  Jerusalem  (21:18).  Elder  (presbuieros)  was  the  Jewish 
name  and  bishop  (episkopos)  the  Greek  name  for  the  same 
office.  "Those  who  are  called  elders  in  speaking  of  Jewish 
communities  are  called  bishops  in  speaking  of  Gentile  com- 
munities" (Hackett).  Hovey  rightly  holds  against  Hackett 
that  teaching  was  a  normal  function  of  these  elders,  pastors 
or  bishops  as  they  were  variously  called  (I  Tim.  3:2;  Titus 
1:9;  I  Cor.  12:28,  30;  Eph.  4:11).  Had  prayed  with  fasting 
{proseuxamenoi  meta  nesieion).  It  was  a  serious  matter, 
this  formal  setting  apart  of  these  "elders"  in  the  churches. 
So  it  was  done  in  a  public  meeting  with  prayer  and  fasting

as  when  Paul  and  Barnabas  were  sent  forth  from  Antioch 
in  Syria  (13:3)  on  this  mission  tour.  They  commended  them 
to  the  Lord  {parethento  autous  tot  kuridi).  Second  aorist  mid- 
dle indicative  of  paratithemi.  Old  and  solemn  word,  to 
entrust,  to  deposit  as  in  a  bank  (I  Tim.  1:18;  II  Tim.  2:2). 
Cf.  paratheke  in  I  Tim.  6:20;  II  Tim.  1:12,  14.  It  was  all 
that  they  could  now  do,  to  commit  them  to  the  Lord  Jesus. 
Jesus  used  this  word  on  the  cross  (Luke  22:32).  On  whom 
they  had  believed  (eis  hon  pepisteukeisan).  Past  perfect  indic- 
ative (without  augment)  of  pisteuo.  They  had  ^'trusted" 
in  Jesus  (II  Tim.  1:12)  and  Paul  now  "entrusts"  them  to 
him  with  confidence.  It  was  a  solemn  and  serious  occasion 
in  each  instance  as  it  always  is  to  set  apart  men  for  the 
ministry.  These  men  may  not  have  been  ideal  men  for  this 
service,  but  they  were  the  only  ones  available  and  they  were 
chosen  from  the  actual  membership  in  each  instance,  men 
who  knew  local  conditions  and  problems. 

24.  When  they  had  spoken  the  word  in  Perga  (lalesantes  en 
Pergei  ton  logon).  Now  they  stopped  and  preached  in  Perga 
which  they  had  apparently  not  done  before  (see  13:13^). 
After  leaving  Antioch  they  passed  on  through  Pisidia,  as  if 
Antioch  was  not  strictly  in  Pisidia  (see  on  13:14)  and  into 
Pamphylia.  They  crossed  from  Perga  to  Attaleia,  the  pwrt 
of  Perga,  sixteen  miles  down  the  Cestus,  and  capital  of 
Pamphylia,  to  find  a  ship  for  Antioch  in  Syria.  It  is  now 
called  Adala  and  for  long  was  the  chief  harbour  of  the  south 
coast  of  Asia  Minor.  We  do  not  know  why  they  did  not  re- 
visit Cyprus,  perhaps  because  no  permanent  Gentile  churches 
were  founded  there. 

26.  They  sailed  away  to  Antioch  {apepleusan  eis  Antv- 
ocheian).  Effective  aorist  active  indicative  of  apopled,  to 
sail  off.  They  had  been  gone  some  eighteen  months.  They  had 
been  committed  (esan  paradedomenoi).  Periphrastic  past 
perfect  passive  of  paradidomi,  old  and  common  verb.  High 
and  serious  thoughts  filled  the  hearts  of  these  first  returned 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  219 

missionaries  as  they  neared  home.  The  grace  of  God  had 
been  with  them.  They  had  fulfilled  {eplerosan)  the  work  to 
which  they  had  been  set  apart  by  the  Holy  Spirit  with  the 
prayers  of  the  Antioch  church.  They  now  had  a  wondrous 
story  to  tell. 

27.  Gathered  the  church  together  {sunagagontes  ten  ekkle- 
sian).  Second  aorist  active  participle  of  sunago.  It  "was  the 
first  missionary  meeting  in  history"  (Furneaux).  It  was  not 
hard  to  get  the  church  together  when  the  news  spread  that 
Paul  and  Barnabas  had  returned.  "The  suitability  of  the 
Gospel  to  become  the  religion  of  the  world  had  not  before 
been  put  to  the  test"  (Furneaux).  Doubtless  many  "wise- 
acres" had  predicted  failure  as  they  did  for  William  Carey 
and  for  Adoniram  Judson  and  Luther  Rice.  Rehearsed 
(aneggellon).  Imperfect  active.  It  was  a  long  story  for  they 
had  many  things  to  tell  of  God's  dealings  "with  them" 
{met*  auton)  for  God  had  been  "with  them"  all  the  while  as 
Jesus  had  said  he  would  be  (Matt.  28:20,  meth'  humon). 
Paul  could  recount  some  of  the  details  given  later  in  II  Cor. 
II.  And  how  (kai  hoti).  Or  "and  that"  in  particular,  as 
the  upshot  of  it  all.  He  had  opened  a  door  of  faith  unto  the 
Gentiles  (enoixen  tois  ethnesin  thuran  piste os).  Three  times 
in  Paul's  Epistles  (I  Cor.  16:9;  II  Cor.  2:12;  Col.  4:3)  he 
employed  the  metaphor  of  "door,"  perhaps  a  reminiscence 
of  the  very  language  of  Paul  here.  This  work  in  Galatia 
gained  a  large  place  in  Paul's  heart  (Gal.  4:i4f.).  The 
Gentiles  now,  it  was  plain,  could  enter  the  kingdom  of  God 
(verse  22)  through  the  door  of  faith,  not  by  law  or  by  cir- 
cumcision or  by  heathen  philosophy  or  mythology. 

28.  And  they  tarried  no  little  time  (dietribon  de  chronon  ouk 
oligon).  Imperfect  active  of  diatriho,  old  verb  to  rub  hard, 
to  consume,  with  accusative  of  extent  of  time.  It  was  a 
happy  time  of  fellowship.  The  experiment  entered  upon  by 
the  church  of  Antioch  was  now  a  pronounced  success.  It  was 
at  the  direct  command  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  but  they  had 


220      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

prayed  for  the  absent  missionaries  and  rejoiced  at  their 
signal  success.  There  is  no  sign  of  jealousy  on  the  part  of 
Barnabas  when  Paul  returns  as  the  chief  hero  of  the  expedi- 
tion. A  new  corner  has  been  turned  in  the  history  of  Chris- 
tianity. There  is  a  new  centre  of  Christian  activity.  What 
will  Jerusalem  think  of  the  new  developments  at  Antioch? 
Paul  and  Barnabas  made  no  report  to  Jerusalem. 


CHAPTER  XV 

I.  And  certain  men  came  down  from  Judea  {kai  tines  katel- 
thontes  apo  tes  loudaias).  Evidently  the  party  of  the  circum- 
cision in  the  church  in  Jerusalem  (11:2)  had  heard  of  the 
spread  of  the  gospel  among  the  Gentiles  in  Cyprus,  Pam- 
phylia,  and  South  Galatia  (Phrygia,  Pisidia,  Lycaonia). 
Possibly  John  Mark  after  his  desertion  at  Perga  (13:13) 
told  of  this  as  one  of  his  reasons  for  coming  home.  At  any 
rate  echoes  of  the  jubilation  in  Antioch  in  Syria  would  be 
certain  to  reach  Jerusalem.  The  Judaizers  in  Jerusalem,  who 
insisted  that  all  the  Gentile  Christians  must  become  Jews 
also,  had  acquiesced  in  the  case  of  Cornelius  and  his  group 
(ii:i-i8)  after  plain  proof  by  Peter  that  it  was  the  Lord's 
doing.  But  they  had  not  agreed  to  a  formal  campaign  to 
turn  the  exception  into  the  rule  and  to  make  Christianity 
mainly  Gentile  with  a  few  Jews  instead  of  mainly  Jewish 
with  a  few  Gentiles.  Since  Paul  and  Barnabas  did  not  come 
up  to  Jerusalem,  the  leaders  among  the  Judaizers  decided 
to  go  down  to  Antioch  and  attack  Paul  and  Barnabas  there. 
They  had  volunteered  to  go  without  church  action  in  Jeru- 
salem for  their  activity  is  disclaimed  by  the  conference 
(Acts  15:24).  In  Gal.  2:4  Paul  with  some  heat  describes 
these  Judaizers  as  "false  brethren,  secretly  introduced  who 
sneaked  in  to  spy  out  our  liberty."  It  is  reasonably  certain 
that  this  visit  to  Jerusalem  described  in  Gal.  2:1-10  is  the 
same  one  as  the  Jerusalem  Conference  in  Acts  15:5-29  in 
spite  of  the  effort  of  Ramsay  to  identify  it  with  that  in 
1 1 :29f.  Paul  in  Galatians  is  not  giving  a  list  of  his  visits  to 
Jerusalem.  He  is  showing  his  independence  of  the  twelve 
apostles  and  his  equality  with  them.  He  did  not  see  them  in 
ii:29f.,  but  only  "the  elders."    In  Acts  15  Luke  gives  the 

331 


222      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

outward  narrative  of  events,  in  Gal.  2:1-10  Paul  shows  us 
the  private  interview  with  the  apostles  when  they  agreed 
on  their  line  of  conduct  toward  the  Judaizers.  In  Gal.  2:2 
by  the  use  of  "them"  (autois)  Paul  seems  to  refer  to  the 
first  public  meeting  in  Acts  before  the  private  interview 
that  came  in  between  verses  5  and  6  of  Acts  15.  If  we  recall 
the  difficulty  that  Peter  had  on  the  subject  of  preaching 
the  gospel  to  the  heathen  (io:i-ii:i8),  we  can  the  better 
understand  the  attitude  of  the  Judaizers.  They  were  men 
of  sincere  convictions  without  a  doubt,  but  they  were  ob- 
scurantists and  unable  and  unwilling  to  receive  new  light 
from  the  Lord  on  a  matter  that  involved  their  racial  and 
social  prejudices.  They  recalled  that  Jesus  himself  had  been 
circumcised  and  that  he  had  said  to  the  Syro-Phoenician 
woman  that  he  had  come  only  save  to  the  lost  sheep  of  the 
house  of  Israel  (Matt.  15:241?.).  They  argued  that  Christ 
had  not  repealed  circumcision.  So  one  of  the  great  religious 
controversies  of  all  time  was  begun,  that  between  spiritual 
religion  and  ritualistic  or  ceremonial  religion.  It  is  with  us 
yet  with  baptism  taking  the  place  of  circumcision.  These 
self-appointed  champions  of  circumcision  for  Gentile  Chris- 
tians were  deeply  in  earnest.  Taught  the  brethren  {edidaskon 
tous  adelphous).  Inchoative  imperfect  active,  began  to  teach 
and  kept  it  up.  Their  attitude  was  one  of  supercilious  superi- 
ority. They  probably  resented  the  conduct  of  Barnabas,  who, 
when  sent  by  the  Church  in  Jerusalem  to  investigate  the  con- 
version of  the  Greeks  in  Antioch  (11:20-26),  did  not  return 
and  report  till  a  strong  church  had  been  established  there 
with  the  help  of  Saul  and  only  then  with  a  big  collection  to 
confuse  the  issue.  Paul  and  Barnabas  were  on  hand,  but 
the  Judaizers  persisted  in  their  efforts  to  force  their  views 
on  the  church  in  Antioch.  It  was  a  crisis.  Except  ye  be  cir- 
cumcised after  the  custom  of  Moses,  ye  cannot  be  saved  {ean  me 
peritmethete  toi  ethei  Mouseos,  ou  dunasthe  sothenai).  There 
was  the  dictum  of  the  Judaizers  to  the  Gentiles.    Paul  and 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  223 

Barnabas  had  been  circumcised.  This  is  probably  the  precise 
language  employed,  for  they  spoke  in  Greek  to  these  Greeks. 
It  is  a  condition  of  the  third  class  (undetermined,  but  with 
prospect  of  being  determined,  ean  plus  the  first  aorist  passive 
subjunctive  of  peritemno).  There  was  thus  hope  held  out 
for  them,  but  only  on  condition  that  they  be  circumcised. 
The  issue  was  sharply  drawn.  The  associative  instrumental 
case  (toi  ethei)  is  customary.  "Saved"  (sothenai)  here  is  the 
Messianic  salvation.  This  doctrine  denied  the  efficacy  of 
the  work  of  Christ. 

2.  When  Paul  and  Barnabas  had  no  small  dissension  and 
questioning  with  them  (Genomenes  staseos  kai  zeteseos  ouk 
oliges  toi  Pauloi  kai  Barnahdi  pros  autous).  Genitive  absolute 
of  second  aorist  middle  participle  of  ginomai,  genitive 
singular  agreeing  with  first  substantive  staseos.  Literally, 
"No  little  (litotes  for  much)  strife  and  questioning  coming 
to  Paul  and  Barnabas  (dative  case)  with  them"  (pros 
autous,  face  to  face  with  them).  Paul  and  Barnabas  were 
not  willing  to  see  this  Gentile  church  brow-beaten  and 
treated  as  heretics  by  these  self-appointed  regulators  of 
Christian  orthodoxy  from  Jerusalem.  The  work  had  devel- 
oped under  the  leadership  of  Paul  and  Barnabas  and  they 
accepted  full  responsibility  for  it  and  stoutly  resisted  these 
Judaizers  to  the  point  of  sedition  (riot,  outbreak  in  Luke 
23:25;  Acts  19:40)  as  in  23:7.  There  is  no  evidence  that  the 
Judaizers  had  any  supporters  in  the  Antioch  church  so  that 
they  failed  utterly  to  make  any  impression.  Probably  these 
Judaizers  compelled  Paul  to  think  through  afresh  his  whole 
gospel  of  grace  and  so  they  did  Paul  and  the  world  a  real 
service.  If  the  Jews  like  Paul  had  to  believe,  it  was  plain  that 
there  was  no  virtue  in  circumcision  (Gal.  2:15-21).  It  is 
not  true  that  the  early  Christians  had  no  disagreements. 
They  had  selfish  avarice  with  Ananias  and  Sapphira,  mur- 
muring over  the  gifts  to  the  widows,  simony  in  the  case  of 
Simon  Magus,  violent  objection  to  work  in  Caesarea,  and 


224      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

now  open  strife  over  a  great  doctrine  (grace  vs.  legalism). 
The  brethren  appointed  (etaxan).  "The  brethren"  can  be 
supplied  from  verse  i  and  means  the  church  in  Antioch. 
The  church  clearly  saw  that  the  way  to  remove  this  dead- 
lock between  the  Judaizers  and  Paul  and  Barnabas  was  to 
consult  the  church  in  Jerusalem  to  which  the  Judaizers  be- 
longed. Paul  and  Barnabas  had  won  in  Antioch.  If  they 
can  win  in  Jerusalem,  that  will  settle  the  matter.  The  Judai- 
zers will  be  answered  in  their  own  church  for  which  they  are 
presuming  to  speak.  The  verb  etaxan  {tasso,  to  arrange) 
suggests  a  formal  appointment  by  the  church  in  regular 
assembly.  Paul  (Gal.  2:2)  says  that  he  went  up  by  rev- 
elation {kat^  apokalupsin),  but  surely  that  is  not  contradic- 
tory to  the  action  of  the  church.  Certain  others  of  them 
{tinas  allous).  Certainly  Titus  (Gal.  2:1,  3),  a  Greek  and 
probably  a  brother  of  Luke  who  is  not  mentioned  in  Acts. 
Rackham  thinks  that  Luke  was  in  the  number.  The  apostles 
and  elders  {tous  apostolous  kai  presbuterous).  Note  one 
article  for  both  (cf.  "the  apostles  and  the  brethren"  in  11  :i). 
"Elders"  now  (11:30)  in  full  force.  The  apostles  have  evi- 
dently returned  now  to  the  city  after  the  death  of  Herod 
Agrippa  I  stopped  the  persecution. 

3.  They  therefore  {hoi  men  oun).  Luke's  favourite  method 
of  resumptive  narrative  as  we  have  seen  (11:19,  etc.), 
demonstrative  hoi  with  men  (indeed)  and  oun  (therefore). 
Being  brought  on  their  way  by  the  church  {propemphthentes 
hupo  tes  ekklesias).  First  aorist  passive  participle  of  pro- 
pempo,  old  verb,  to  send  forward  under  escort  as  a  mark  of 
honour  as  in  20:38;  21:5;  III  John  6.  They  were  given  a 
grand  send-oflF  by  the  church  in  Antioch.  Passed  through

joy  {epoioun  charan  megalen).  Imperfect  active.  They 
were  raising  a  constant  paean  of  praise  as  they  proceeded 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  225 

toward  Jerusalem.    Probably  the  Judaizers  had  gone  on  or 
kept  still. 

4.  Were  received  {paredechthesan).  First  aorist  passive 
indicative  of  paradechomaij  old  verb,  to  receive,  to  wel- 
come. Here  it  was  a  public  reception  for  Paul  and  Bar- 
nabas provided  by  the  whole  church  including  the  apostles 
and  elders,  at  which  an  opportunity  was  given  to  hear  the 
story  of  Paul  and  Barnabas  about  God's  dealings  with 
them  among  the  Gentiles.  This  first  public  meeting  is  re- 
ferred to  by  Paul  in  Gal.  2:2  "I  set  before  them  {autois)  the 
gospel,  etc." 

5.  But  there  rose  up  {exanestesan  de).  Second  aorist  active 
indicative  (intransitive).  Note  both  ex  and  an.  These  men 
rose  up  out  of  the  crowd  at  a  critical  moment.  They  were 
believers  in  Christ  (pepisteukotes,  having  believed),  but  were 
still  members  of  "the  sect  of  the  Pharisees"  (tes  haireseos 
ton  Pharisaion).  Evidently  they  still  held  to  the  Pharisaic 
narrowness  shown  in  the  attack  on  Peter  (ii:2f.).  Note  the 
dogmatism  of  their  "must"  {dei)  after  the  opposition  of 
Paul  and  Barnabas  to  their  "except"  {ean  me)  at  Antioch 
(15:1).  They  are  unconvinced  and  expected  to  carry  the 
elders  with  them.  Codex  Bezae  says  that  they  had  appealed 
to  the  elders  (15:2,  5).  At  any  rate  they  have  made  the  issue 
in  open  meeting  at  the  height  of  the  jubilation.  It  is  plain 
from  verse  6  that  this  meeting  was  adjourned,  for  another 
gathering  came  together  then.  It  is  here  that  the  private 
conference  of  which  Paul  speaks  in  Galatians  2:1-10  took 
place.  It  was  Paul's  chance  to  see  the  leaders  in  Jerusalem 
(Peter,  James,  and  John)  and  he  won  them  over  to  his  view 
of  Gentile  liberty  from  the  Mosaic  law  so  that  the  next 
public  conference  (Acts  15:6-29)  ratified  heartily  the  views 
of  Paul,  Barnabas,  Peter,  James,  and  John.  It  was  a  diplo- 
matic triumph  of  the  first  order  and  saved  Christianity 
from  the  bondage  of  Jewish  ceremonial  sacramentalism. 
So  far  as  we  know  this  is  the  only  time  that  Paul  and  John 


226      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

met  face  to  face,  the  great  spirits  in  Christian  history  after 
Jesus  our  Lord.  It  is  a  bit  curious  to  see  men  saying  today 
that  Paul  surrendered  about  Titus  and  had  him  circumcised 
for  the  salie  of  peace,  the  very  opposite  of  what  he  says  in 
Galatians,  "to  whom  I  yielded,  no  not  for  an  hour."  Titus 
as  a  Greek  was  a  red  flag  to  the  Judaizers  and  to  the  com- 
promisers, but  Paul  stood  his  ground. 

6.  Were  gathered  together  (sunechthesan).  First  aorist 
(effective)  passive  indicative.  The  church  is  not  named  here 
as  in  verse  4,  but  we  know  from  verses  12  and  22  that  the 
whole  church  came  together  this  time  also  along  with  the 
apostles  and  elders.  Of  this  matter  {peri  tou  logon  toutou). 
Same  idiom  in  8:21;  19:38.  They  realized  the  importance  of 
the  issue. 

7.  When  there  had  been  much  questioning  {polles  letesebs 
genomenes).  Genitive  absolute  with  second  aorist  middle 
participle  of  ginomai.  Evidently  the  Judaizers  were  given 
full  opportunity  to  air  all  their  grievances  and  objections. 
They  were  allowed  plenty  of  time  and  there  was  no  effort 
to  shut  off  debate  or  to  rush  anything  through  the  meeting. 
Peter  rose  up  (anastas  Petros).  The  wonder  was  that  he  had 
waited  so  long.  Probably  Paul  asked  him  to  do  so.  He  was 
the  usual  spokesman  for  the  apostles  and  his  activities  in 
Jerusalem  were  well-known.  In  particular  his  experience 
at  Caesarea  (Acts  10)  had  caused  trouble  here  in  Jerusalem 
from  this  very  same  party  of  the  circumcism  (Acts  11  :i-i8). 
It  was  fitting  that  Peter  should  speak.  This  is  the  last  time 
that  Peter  appears  in  the  Acts.  A  good  while  ago  (aph* 
hemeron  archaion).  From  ancient  days.  The  adjective 
archaios  is  from  arche^  beginning,  and  its  actual  age  is  a  mat- 
ter of  relativity.  So  Mnason  (Acts  21:16)  is  termed  "an 
ancient  disciple."  It  was  probably  a  dozen  years  since  God 
"made  choice"  {exelexato)  to  speak  by  Peter's  mouth  to 
Cornelius  and  the  other  Gentiles  in  Caesarea.  His  point  is 
that  what  Paul  and  Barnabas  have  reported  is  nothing  new. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  227 

The  Judaizers   made  objection    then   as   they  are   doing 
now. 

8.  Which  knoweth  the  heart  (kardiognostes).  Late  word 
from  kardia  (heart)  and  gnostes  (known,  ginosko).  In  the 
N.T.  only  here  and  1:24  which  see.  Giving  them  the  Holy 
Spirit  (dous  to  pneuma  to  hagion).  And  before  their  bap- 
tism. This  was  the  Lord's  doing.  They  had  accepted  (11  :i8) 
this  witness  of  God  then  and  it  was  true  now  of  these  other 
Gentile  converts. 

9.  He  made  no  distinction  between  us  and  them  (outhen 
diekrinen  metaxu  hemon  te  kai  auton).  He  distinguished  noth- 
ing (first  aorist  active  ind.)  between  (both  dia  and  metaxu) 
both  {te  kai)  us  and  them.  In  the  matter  of  faith  and  con- 
version God  treated  us  Jews  as  heathen  and  the  heathen  as 
Jews.  Cleansing  their  hearts  by  faith  (tei  pistei  katharisas  tas 
kardias  auton).  Not  by  works  nor  by  ceremonies.  Peter 
here  has  a  thoroughly  Pauline  and  Johannine  idea  of  salva- 
tion for  all  both  Jew  and  Greek.   Cf.  10:15. 

10.  Why  tempt  ye  God?  (ti  peirazete  ton  theon;).  By  imply- 
ing that  God  had  made  a  mistake  this  time,  though  right 
about  Cornelius.  It  is  a  home-thrust.  They  were  refusing 
to  follow  the  guidance  of  God  like  the  Israelites  at  Massah 
and  Meribah  (Ex.  17:7;  Deut.  6:16;  I  Cor.  10:9).  That  ye 
should  put  (epitheinai).  Second  aorist  active  infinitive  of 
epitithemi,  epexegetic,  explaining  the  tempting.  ^  yoke  upon 
the  neck  {zugon  epi  ton  trachelon).  Familiar  image  of  oxen 
with  yokes  upon  the  necks.  Paul's  very  image  for  the  yoke 
of  bondage  of  the  Mosaic  law  in  Gal.  5:1.  It  had  probably 
been  used  in  the  private  interview.  Cf.  the  words  of  Jesus 
about  the  Pharisees  (Matt.  23*4)  and  how  easy  and  light 
his  own  yoke  is  (Matt.  1 1 :3o).  Were  able  to  bear  {ischusamen 
bastasai).  Neither  our  fathers  nor  we  had  strength  (ischuo) 
to  carry  this  yoke  which  the  Judaizers  wish  to  put  on  the 
necks  of  the  Gentiles.  Peter  speaks  as  the  spiritual  emanci- 
pator. He  had  been  slow  to  see  the  meaning  of  God's  dealings 


228      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

with  him  at  Joppa  and  Caesarea,  but  he  has  seen  clearly  by 
now.  He  takes  his  stand  boldly  with  Paul  and  Barnabas 
for  Gentile  freedom. 

11.  That  we  shall  be  saved  {sothenai).  First  aorist  passive 
infinitive  in  indirect  discourse  after  pisteuomen.  More  ex- 
actly, "We  believe  that  we  are  saved  through  the  grace  of 
the  Lord  Jesus  in  like  manner  as  they  also."  This  thoroughly 
Pauline  note  shows  that  whatever  hopes  the  Judaizers  had 
about  Peter  were  false.  His  doctrine  of  grace  is  as  clear  as  a 
bell.  He  has  lifted  his  voice  against  salvation  by  ceremony 
and  ritualism.    It  was  a  great  deliverance. 

12.  Kept  silence  (esigesen).  Ingressive  first  aorist  active 
of  sigao,  old  verb,  to  hold  one's  peace.  All  the  multitude 
became  silent  after  Peter's  speech  and  because  of  it.  Heark- 
ened {ekouon).  Imperfect  active  of  akouo,  descriptive  of  the 
rapt  attention,  were  listening.  Unto  Barnabas  and  Paul 
(Barnaba  kai  Paulou).  Note  placing  Barnabas  before  Paul 
as  in  verse  25,  possibly  because  in  Jerusalem  Barnabas  was 
still  better  known  than  Paul.  Rehearsing  (exegoumenon). 
Present  middle  participle  of  exegeomai^  old  verb,  to  go 
through  or  lead  out  a  narrative  of  events  as  in  Luke  24:35; 
Acts  10:8  which  see.  Three  times  (14:27;  15:4,  12)  Paul  is 
described  as  telling  the  facts  about  their  mission  work, 
facts  more  eloquent  than  argument  (Page).  One  of  the  cry- 
ing needs  in  the  churches  is  fuller  knowledge  of  the  facts  of 
mission  work  and  progress  with  enough  detail  to  give  life 
and  interest.  The  signs  and  wonders  which  God  had  wrought 
among  the  Gentiles  set  the  seal  of  approval  on  the  work 
done  through  (dia)  Barnabas  and  Paul.  This  had  been 
Peter's  argument  about  Cornelius  (11:17).  This  same  verb 
(exegesato)  is  used  by  James  in  verse  14  referring  to  Peter's 
speech. 

13.  y^fter  they  had  held  their  peace  {meta  to  sigesai  autous). 
Literally,  "after  the  becoming  silent  (ingressive  aorist 
active  of  the  articular  infinitive)  as  to  them  (Barnabas  and 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  229 

Paul,  accusative  of  general  reference)."  James  answered 
{apekrithe  lakobos).  First  aorist  passive  (deponent)  indica- 
tive. It  was  expected  that  James,  as  President  of  the  Con- 
ference, would  speak  last.  But  he  wisely  waited  to  give 
every  one  an  opportunity  to  speak.  The  challenge  of  the 
Judaizers  called  for  an  opinion  from  James.  Furneaux 
thinks  that  he  may  have  been  elected  one  of  the  twelve  to 
take  the  place  of  James  the  brother  of  John  since  Paul  (Gal. 
1:19)  calls  him  apostle.  More  likely  he  was  asked  to  preside 
because  of  his  great  gifts  and  character  as  chief  of  the  elders. 
14.  Hearken  unto  me  (akousate  mou).  Usual  appeal  for 
attention.  James  was  termed  James  the  Just  and  was  con- 
sidered a  representative  of  the  Hebraic  as  opposed  to  the 
Hellenistic  wing  of  the  Jewish  Christians  (Acts  6:1).  The 
Judaizers  had  doubtless  counted  on  him  as  a  champion 
of  their  view  and  did  later  wrongfully  make  use  of  his  name 
against  Peter  at  Antioch  (Gal.  2:12).  There  was  instant 
attention  when  James  began  to  speak.  Symeon  (Sumeon). 
The  Aramaic  form  of  Simon  as  in  H  Peter  2:1.  This  little 
touch  would  show  his  affinities  with  the  Jewish  Christians 
(not  the  Judaizers).  This  Aramaic  form  is  used  also  in  Luke 
2:25,  34  of  the  old  prophet  in  the  temple.  Possibly  both 
forms  (Symeon,  Aramaic,  and  Simon,  Greek)  were  current 
in  Jerusalem.  How  (kathos).  Strictly,  "according  as,"  here 
like  hos  in  indirect  discourse  somewhat  like  the  e'pexegetic 
or  explanatory  use  in  HI  John  3.  First  (proton).  Told  by 
Peter  in  verse  7.  James  notes,  as  Peter  did,  that  this  expe- 
rience of  Barnabas  and  Paul  is  not  the  beginning  of  work 
among  the  Gentiles.  Did  visit  (epeskepsato).  First  aorist 
middle  indicative  of  episkeptomai,  old  verb  to  look  upon, 
to  look  after,  provide  for.  This  same  verb  occurs  in  James 
1:27  and  is  one  of  various  points  of  similarity  between  this 
speech  of  James  in  Acts  and  the  Epistle  of  James  as  shown 
by  Mayor  in  his  Commentary  on  James.  Somehow  Luke 
may  have  obtained  notes  of  these  various  addresses.     To 


230     WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

take  from  the  Gentiles  a  people  for  his  name  {lahein  ex  ethnon 
laon  tot  onomati  autou).  Bengel  calls  this  egregium  paradoxoUy 
a  chosen  people  {laon)  out  of  the  Gentiles  {ethnon).  This 
is  what  is  really  involved  in  what  took  place  at  Caesarea 
at  the  hands  of  Peter  and  the  campaign  of  Barnabas  and 
Paul  from  Antioch.  But  such  a  claim  of  God's  purpose 
called  for  proof  from  Scripture  to  convince  Jews  and  this  is 
precisely  what  James  undertakes  to  give.  This  new  Israel 
from  among  the  Gentiles  is  one  of  Paul's  great  doctrines  as 
set  forth  in  Gal.  3  and  Rom.  9-1 1.  Note  the  use  of  God's 
"name"  here  for  "the  Israel  of  God"  (Gal.  6:16). 

15.  To  this  agree  {toutoi  sumphbnousin) .  Associative  in- 
strumental case  {toutoi)  after  sumphonousin  (voice  together 
with,  symphony  with,  harmonize  with),  from  sumphoneo, 
old  verb  seen  already  in  Matt.  18:19;  Luke  5:36;  Acts  5:9 
which  see.  James  cites  only  Amos  9:11  and  12  from  the  LXX 
as  an  example  of  "the  words  of  the  prophets"  {hoi  logoi  ton 
prophetbn)  to  which  he  refers  on  this  point.  The  somewhat 
free  quotation  runs  here  through  verses  16  to  18  of  Acts  15 
and  is  exceedingly  pertinent.  The  Jewish  rabbis  often  failed 
to  understand  the  prophets  as  Jesus  showed.  The  passage 
in  Amos  refers  primarily  to  the  restoration  of  the  Davidic 
empire,  but  also  the  Messiah's  Kingdom  (the  throne  of 
David  his  father,"  Luke  1:32). 

16.  /  will  build  again  {anoikodomeso).  Here  LXX  has 
anasteso.  Compound  {ana,  up  or  again)  of  oikodomeo,  the 
verb  used  by  Jesus  in  Matt.  16:18  of  the  general  church  or 
kingdom  as  here  which  see.  The  tabernacle  of  David  {ten 
skenen  Daueid),  a  poetical  figure  of  the  throne  of  David 
(II  Sam.  7:12)  now  "the  fallen  tent"  {ten  peptokuian)^ 
perfect  active  participle  of  pipto,  state  of  completion.  The 
ruins  thereof  {ta  katestrammena  autes).  Literally,  "the 
ruined  portions  of  it."  Perfect  passive  participle  of  katas- 
trepho,  to  turn  down.  It  is  a  desolate  picture  of  the  fallen, 
torn  down  tent  of  David.    /  will  set  it  up  {anorthoso).    Old 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  231 

verb  from  anorthoo  (ana,  orthos),  to  set  upright.  See  on  Luke 
13  :i3  of  the  old  woman  whose  crooked  back  was  set  straight. 

17.  That  the  residue  of  men  may  seek  after  the  Lord  (hopos 
an  ekzetesosin  hoi  kataloipoi  ton  anthropon  ton  kurion).  The 
use  of  hopos  with  the  subjunctive  (effective  aorist  active)  to 
express  purpose  is  common  enough  and  note  an  for  an  addi- 
tional tone  of  uncertainty.  On  the  rarity  of  an  with  hopos 
in  the  KoinS  see  Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  986.  Here  the 
Gentiles  are  referred  to.  The  Hebrew  text  is  quite  different, 
"that  they  may  possess  the  remnant  of  Edom."  Certainly 
the  LXX  suits  best  the  point  that  James  is  making.  But 
the  closing  words  of  this  verse  point  definitely  to  the  Gentiles 
both  in  the  Hebrew  and  the  LXX,  "all  the  Gentiles"  {panta 
ta  ethne).  Another  item  of  similarity  between  this  speech 
and  the  Epistle  of  James  is  in  the  phrase  "my  name  is  called" 
{epikekletai  to  onoma  mou)  and  James  2:7.  The  purpose  of 
God,  though  future,  is  expressed  by  this  perfect  passive  in- 
dicative epikekletai  from  epi-kaleo,  to  call  on.  It  is  a  Jewish 
way  of  speaking  of  those  who  worship  God. 

18.  From  the  beginning  of  the  world  {ap'  aionos).  Or,  "from 
of  old."  James  adds  these  words,  perhaps  with  a  reminiscence 
of  Isa.  45:21.  His  point  is  that  this  purpose  of  God,  as  set 
forth  in  Amos,  is  an  old  one.  God  has  an  Israel  outside  of  and 
beyond  the  Jewish  race,  whom  he  will  make  his  true  "Israel" 
and  so  there  is  no  occasion  for  surprise  in  the  story  of  God's 
dealings  with  the  Gentiles  as  told  by  Barnabas  and  Paul. 
God's  eternal  purpose  of  grace  includes  all  who  call  upon 
his  name  in  every  land  and  people  (Isa.  2:1;  Micah.4:i). 
This  larger  and  richer  purpose  and  plan  of  God  was  one  of 
the  mysteries  which  Paul  will  unfold  in  the  future  (Rom. 
16:25;  Eph.  3:9).  James  sees  it  clearly  now.  God  is  making 
it  known  [poion  tauta  gnosta),  if  they  will  only  be  willing 
to  see  and  understand.  It  was  a  great  deliverance  that 
James  had  made  and  it  exerted  a  profound  influence  on 
the  assembly. 


232      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

19.  Wherefore  {dio).  "Because  of  which,"  this  plain  pur- 
pose of  God  as  shown  by  Amos  and  Isaiah.  My  judgment  is 
(ego  krino).  Note  expression  of  ego.  I  give  my  judgment. 
{Ego  censeo).  James  sums  up  the  case  as  President  of  the 
Conference  in  a  masterly  fashion  and  with  that  consummate 
wisdom  for  which  he  is  noted.  It  amounts  to  a  resolution 
for  the  adoption  by  the  assembly  as  happened  (verse  33). 
That  we  trouble  not  {me  parenochlein).  Present  active  infini- 
tive with  me  in  an  indirect  command  (Robertson,  Grammar, 
p.  1046)  of  parenochleo,  a  common  late  verb,  occurring  here 
alone  in  the  N.T.  This  double  compound  {para,  en)  is  from 
the  old  compound  enochleb  {en  and  ochlos,  crowd,  annoyance) 
seen  in  Luke  6:18  and  Heb.  12:15,  ^^^  means  to  cause 
trouble  beside  {para)  one  or  in  a  matter.  This  is  the  general 
point  of  James  which  he  explains  further  concerning  "those 
who  are  turning  from  the  Gentiles  unto  God,"  the  very 
kind  of  people  referred  to  in  Amos. 

20.  But  that  we  write  unto  them  {alia  episteilai  autois). 
By  way  of  contrast  {alia).  First  aorist  active  infinitive  of 
epistello,  old  verb  to  send  to  one  (message,  letter,  etc.). 
Our  word  epistle  {epistole  as  in  verse  30)  comes  from  this 
verb.  In  the  N.T.  only  here,  Heb.  13:22,  and  possibly  Acts 
21:25.  That  they  abstain  from  {tou  apechesthai).  The  genitive 
of  the  articular  infinitive  of  purpose,  present  middle  (direct) 
of  apecho,  old  verb,  to  hold  oneself  back  from.  The  best  old 
MSB.  do  not  have  apo,  but  the  ablative  is  clear  enough  in 
what  follows.  James  agrees  with  Peter  in  his  support  of 
Paul  and  Barnabas  in  their  contention  for  Gentile  freedom 
from  the  Mosaic  ceremonial  law.  The  restrictions  named  by 
James  affect  the  moral  code  that  applies  to  all  (idolatry, 
fornication,  murder).  Idolatry,  fornication  and  murder  were 
the  outstanding  sins  of  paganism  then  and  now  (Rev. 
22:15).  Harnack  argues  ably  against  the  genuineness  of  the 
word  pniktou  (strangled)  which  is  absent  from  D  Irenaeus, 
Tertullian,  Cyprian.  It  is  a  nice  point,  though  the  best  MSS. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  233 

have  it  in  accord  with  Lev.  17:10-16.  The  problem  is  whether 
the  words  were  added  because  "blood"  was  understood  as 
not  "murder,"  but  a  reference  to  the  Mosaic  regulation  or 
whether  it  was  omitted  to  remove  the  ceremonial  aspect 
and  make  it  all  moral  and  ethical.  The  Western  text  omits 
the  word  also  in  verse  29.  But  with  the  word  retained  here 
and  in  verse  29  the  solution  of  James  is  not  a  compromise, 
though  there  is  a  wise  concession  to  Jewish  feeling.  Pollu- 
tions of  idols  {alisgematon).  From  alisgeo  only  in  the  LXX 
and  this  substantive  nowhere  else.  The  word  refers  to  idola- 
trous practices  (pollutions)  and  things  sacrificed  to  idols 
(eidoluthon)  in  verse  29,  not  to  sacrificial  meat  sold  in  the 
market  (I  Cor.  10:27),  ^  matter  not  referred  to  here.  Cf. 
Lev.  17:1-9.  All  the  four  items  in  the  position  of  James 
(accepting  pniktou)  are  mentioned  in  Lev.  17  and  18. 

21.  for  Moses  (Mouses  gar).  A  reason  why  these  four 
necessary  things  (verse  28)  are  named.  In  every  city  are 
synagogues  where  rabbis  proclaim  (kerussontas)  these  mat- 
ters. Hence  the  Gentile  Christians  would  be  giving  constant 
offence  to  neglect  them.  The  only  point  where  modern  Chris- 
tian sentiment  would  object  would  be  about  "things  stran- 
gled" and  "blood"  in  the  sense  of  any  blood  left  in  the 
animals,  though  most  Christians  probably  agree  with  the 
feeling  of  James  in  objecting  to  blood  in  the  food.  If  "blood " 
is  taken  to  be  "murder,"  that  difficulty  vanishes.  Moses 
will  suffer  no  loss  for  these  Gentile  Christians  are  not  adher- 
ents of  Judaism. 

22.  Then  it  seemed  good  {Tote  edoxen).  First  aorist  active 
indicative  of  dokeo.  A  regular  idiom  at  the  beginning  of 
decrees.  This  Eirenicon  of  James  commended  itself  to  the 
whole  assembly.  Apparently  a  vote  was  taken  which  was 
unanimous,  the  Judaizers  probably  not  voting.  The  apostles 
and  the  elders  {tois  apostolois  kai  tois  presbuterois,  article 
with  each,  dative  case)  probably  all  vocally  expressed  their 
position.      With  the  whole  church   (sun  holei  tei  ekklesidi).

Probably  by  acclamation.  It  was  a  great  victory.  But 
James  was  a  practical  leader  and  he  did  not  stop  with 
speeches  and  a  vote.  To  choose  men  out  of  their  company 
{eklezamenous  andras  ex  auton).  Accusative  case,  though 
dative  just  before  {tots  apostolois,  etc.),  of  first  aorist  middle 
participle  of  eklego,  to  select.  This  loose  case  agreement 
appears  also  in  grapsantes  in  verse  23  and  in  MSS.  in  verse 
25.  It  is  a  common  thing  in  all  Greek  writers  (Paul,  for 
instance),  especially  in  the  papyri  and  in  the  Apocalypse 
of  John.  Judas  called  Barsabbas  {loudan  ton  kaloumenon 
Barsabban).  Not  otherwise  known  unless  he  is  a  brother  of 
Joseph  Barsabbas  of  1 123,  an  early  follower  of  Jesus.  The 
other,  Silas,  is  probably  a  shortened  form  of  Silvanus  (Sx7- 
ouanos,  I  Peter  5:12),  the  companion  of  Paul  in  his  second 
mission  tour  (Acts  15:32,  41;  16:25).  Chief  men  {hegoume- 
nous).  Leaders,  leading  men  (participle  from  hegeomai,  to 
lead). 

23.  And  they  wrote  (grapsantes).  First  aorist  active  par- 
ticiple of  grapho  and  the  nominative  as  if  a  principal  verb 
epempsan  had  been  used  instead  of  pempsai,  the  first  aorist 
active  infinitive  (anacoluthon).  This  committee  of  four 
(Judas,  Silas,  Barnabas,  Paul)  carried  the  letter  which  em- 
bodied the  decision  of  the  Conference.  This  letter  is  the 
writing  out  of  the  judgment  of  James  and  apparently  written 
by  him  as  the  President.  The  apostles  and  the  elders^  brethren 
{hoi  apostoloi  kai  hoi  presbuteroi,  adelphoi).  So  the  oldest 
and  best  MSS.  without  kai  (and)  before  "brethren."  This 
punctuation  is  probably  correct  and  not  "elder  brethren." 
The  inquiry  had  been  sent  to  the  apostles  and  elders  (verse 
2)  though  the  whole  church  joined  in  the  welcome  (verse  4) 
and  in  the  decision  (verse  22).  The  apostles  and  elders  send 
the  epistle,  but  call  themselves  "brothers  to  brothers," 
Fratres  Fratibus  Salutem.  "The  brothers"  (tois  adelphois) 
addressed  (dative  case)  are  of  the  Gentiles  {ex  ethnbn)  and 
those  in  Antioch,  Syria,  and  Cilicia,  because  they  were  im- 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  235 

mediately  involved.  But  the  decision  of  this  Conference 
was  meant  for  Gentile  Christians  everywhere  (16:4).  Greet- 
ing (Chairein).  The  customary  formula  in  the  beginning  of 
letters,  the  absolute  infinitive  (usually  chairein)  with  the 
nominative  absolute  also  as  in  James  1:1;  Acts  23:26  and 
innumerable  papyri  (Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  I902f.). 

24.  Certain  which  went  from  us  {tines  ex  hemon,  Aleph  B 
omit  exelthontes).  A  direct  blow  at  the  Judaizers,  put  in  del- 
icate language  (we  heard  ekousamen)  as  if  only  at  Antioch 
(15:1),  and  not  also  in  Jerusalem  in  open  meeting  (15:5). 
Have  troubled  you  with  words  (etaraxan  humas  logois).  What 
a  picture  of  turmoil  in  the  church  in  Antioch,  words,  words, 
words.  Aorist  tense  of  the  common  verb  tarasso,  to  agitate, 
to  make  the  heart  palpitate  (John  14:1,  27)  and  instrumental 
case  of  logois.  Subverting  your  souls  {anaskeuazontes  tas 
psuchas  humon).  Present  active  participle  of  anaskeuazo, 
old  verb  (ana  and  skeuos,  baggage)  to  pack  up  baggage,  to 
plunder,  to  ravage.  Powerful  picture  of  the  havoc  wrought 
by  the  Judaizers  among  the  simple-minded  Greek  Chris- 
tians in  Antioch.  To  whom  we  gave  no  commandment  (hois 
ou  diesteilametha).  First  aorist  middle  indicative  of  dias- 
tell5,  old  verb  to  draw  asunder,  to  distinguish,  to  set  forth 
distinctly,  to  command.  This  is  a  flat  disclaimer  of  the 
whole  conduct  of  the  Judaizers  in  Antioch  and  in  Jerusalem, 
a  complete  repudiation  of  their  eflfort  to  impose  the  Mosaic 
ceremonial  law  upon  the  Gentile  Christians. 

25.  It  seemed  good  unto  us  (edoxen  hemin).  See  statement 
by  Luke  in  verse  22,  and  now  this  definite  decision  is  in  the 
epistle  itself.  It  is  repeated  in  verse  28.  Having  come  to  one 
accord  (genomenois  homothumadon) .  On  this  adverb,  com- 
mon in  Acts,  see  on  i  :i4.  But  genomenois  clearly  means  that 
the  final  unity  was  the  result  of  the  Conference  (private  and 
public  talks).  The  Judaizers  are  here  brushed  to  one  side 
as  the  defeated  disturbers  that  they  really  were  who  had 
lacked  the  courage  to  vote  against  the  majority.    To  choose

out  men  and  send  them  (ek/examenois  andras  pempsai  A  B  L, 
though  Aleph  C  D  read  eklexamenous  as  in  verse  22).  Pre- 
cisely the  same  idiom  as  in  verse  22,  "having  chosen  out  to 
send."  With  our  beloved  Barnabas  and  Paul  {sun  tois  agape- 
tois  hembn  Barnabdi  kai  Pauloi).  The  verbal  adjective 
agapetois  (common  in  the  N.T.)  definitely  sets  the  seal  of 
warm  approval  on  Barnabas  and  Paul.  Paul  (Gal.  2:9)  con- 
firms this  by  his  statement  concerning  the  right  hand  of 
fellowship  given. 

26.  Have  hazarded  their  lives  (paradedokosi  tas  psuchas 
auton).  Perfect  active  participle  dative  plural  of  paradidomi, 
old  word,  to  hand  over  to  another,  and  with  psuchas,  to  hand 
over  to  another  their  lives.  The  sufferings  of  Paul  and  Bar- 
nabas in  Pisidia  and  Lycaonia  were  plainly  well-known  just 
as  the  story  of  Judson  in  Burmah  is  today.  On  the  use  of 
"name"  here  see  on  3:6. 

27.  Who  themselves  also  shall  tell  you  the  same  things  by 
word  of  mouth  {kai  autous  dia  logou  apaggellontas  ta  auta). 
Literally,  "they  themselves  also  by  speech  announcing  the 
same  things."  The  present  participle,  as  here,  sometimes  is 
used  like  the  future  to  express  purpose  as  in  3:26  eulogounta 
after  apesteilen  and  so  here  apaggellontas  after  apestalkamen 
(Robertson,  Grammar^  p.  11 28).  Judas  and  Silas  are  specifi- 
cally endorsed  (perfect  active  indicative  of  apostello)  as 
bearers  of  the  epistle  who  will  also  verbally  confirm  the 
contents  of  the  letter. 

28.  To  the  Holy  Spirit  and  to  us  {toi  pneumati  toi  hagioi 
kai  hemin).  Dative  case  after  edoxen  (third  example,  verses 
22,  25,  28).  Definite  claim  that  the  church  in  this  action  had 
the  guidance  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  That  fact  was  plain  to  the 
church  from  what  had  taken  place  in  Caesarea  and  in  this 
campaign  of  Paul  and  Barnabas  (verse  8).  Jesus  had  prom- 
ised that  the  Holy  Spirit  would  guide  them  into  all  truth 
(John  16:13).  Even  so  the  church  deliberated  carefully 
before  deciding.    What  a  blessing  it  would  be  if  this  were 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  237 

always  true!  But  even  so  the  Judaizers  are  only  silenced 
for  the  present,  not  convinced  and  only  waiting  for  a  better 
day  to  start  over  again.  No  greater  burden  (meden  pleon 
baros).  The  restrictions  named  did  constitute  some  burden 
(cf.  Matt.  20:12),  for  the  old  word  baros  means  weight  or 
heaviness.  Morality  itself  is  a  restraint  upon  one's  impulses 
as  is  all  law  a  prohibition  against  license. 

29.  Than  these  necessary  things  {plen  tout  on  ton  epanagkes). 
This  old  adverb  (from  epi  and  anagk^)  means  on  compul- 
sion, of  necessity.  Here  only  in  the  N.T.  For  discussion  of 
these  items  see  on  verses  20  and  21.  In  comparison  with  the 
freedom  won  this  "burden"  is  light  and  not  to  be  regarded 
as  a  compromise  in  spite  of  the  arguments  of  Lightfoot  and 
Ramsay,  It  was  such  a  concession  as  any  converted  Gentile 
would  be  glad  to  make  even  if  "things  strangled"  be  in- 
cluded. This  "necessity"  was  not  a  matter  of  salvation 
but  only  for  fellowship  between  Jews  and  Gentiles.  The 
Judaizers  made  the  law  of  Moses  essential  to  salvation 
(15:16).  It  shall  be  well  with  you  {eu  praxete).  Ye  shall  fare 
well.  A  classical  idiom  used  here  effectively.  The  peace 
and  concord  in  the  fellowship  of  Jews  and  Gentiles  will 
justify  any  slight  concession  on  the  part  of  the  Gentiles. 
This  letter  is  not  laid  down  as  a  law,  but  it  is  the  judgment 
of  the  Jerusalem  Christians  for  the  guidance  of  the  Gentiles 
(16:4)  and  it  had  a  fine  effect  at  once  (15:30-35).  Trouble 
did  come  later  from  the  Judaizers  who  were  really  hostile 
to  the  agreement  in  Jerusalem,  but  that  opposition  in  no 
way  discredits  the  worth  of  the  work  of  this  Conference. 
No  sane  agreement  will  silence  perpetual  and  professional 
disturbers  like  these  Judaizers  who  will  seek  to  unsettle 
Paul's  work  in  Antioch,  in  Corinth,  in  Galatia,  in  Jerusalem, 
in  Rome.  Fare  ye  well  (Errosthe).  Valete.  Perfect  passive 
imperative  of  rhonnumi,  to  make  strong.  Common  at  the 
close  of  letters.  Be  made  strong,  keep  well,  fare  well.  Here 
alone  in  the  N.T.  though  some  MSS.  have  it  in  23  130.

30.  So  they  {hoi  men  oun).  As  in  verse  3.  When  they  were 
dismissed  {apoluthentes).  First  aorist  passive  participle  of 
apoluo,  common  verb  to  loosen,  to  dismiss.  Possibly  (Hack- 
ett)  religious  services  were  held  as  in  verse  33  (cf.  13:3) 
and  perhaps  an  escort  for  part  of  the  way  as  in  verse  3. 
The  multitude  {to  plethos).  Public  meeting  of  the  church  as 
in  verses  1-3.  Deissmann  {Bible  Studies,  p.  232)  gives  illus- 
trations from  the  inscriptions  of  the  use  of  plethos  for  offi- 
cial, political,  and  religious  gatherings.  The  committee 
formally  "delivered"  {epedbkan)  the  epistle  to  the  church 
authorities. 

3 1 .  When  they  had  read  it  {anagnontes).  Second  aorist  active 
participle  of  anaginosko.  Public  reading,  of  course,  to  the 
church.  They  rejoiced  {echaresan).  Second  aorist  (ingressive) 
passive  indicative  of  chairo.  .  They  burst  into  exultant  joy 
showing  clearly  that  they  did  not  consider  it  a  weak  compro- 
mise, but  a  glorious  victory  of  Gentile  liberty.  For  the  conso- 
lation {epi  tei  paraklesei).  The  encouragement,  the  cheer  in 
the  letter.  See  parekalesan  in  verse  32.  Consolation  and 
exhortation  run  into  one  another  in  this  word. 

32.  Being  themselves  also  prophets  {kai  autoi  prophetai 
ontes).  As  well  as  Paul  and  Barnabas  and  like  Agabus  (11: 
27-30),  for-speakers  for  Christ  who  justify  the  commenda- 
tion in  the  letter  (verse  27)  "with  many  words"  {dia  logon 
pollou),  "with  much  talk,"  and  no  doubt  with  kindly  words 
concerning  the  part  played  at  the  Conference  by  Paul  and 
Barnabas.  Confirmed  {epesterixan).  See  on  14:22.  It  was  a 
glorious  time  with  no  Judaizers  to  disturb  their  fellowship 
as  in  1-3. 

33.  Some  time  {chronon).  Accusative  after  poiesantes^ 
"having  done  time."  How  long  we  do  not  know. 

34.  But  it  seemed  good  unto  Silas  to  abide  there  {edoxe  de 
Sildi  epimeinai  autou).  This  verse  is  not  in  the  Revised 
Version  or  in  the  text  of  Westcott  and  Hort,  being  absent 
from  Aleph  A  B  Vulgate,  etc.     It  is  clearly  an  addition  to 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  239 

help  explain  the  fact  that  Silas  is  back  in  Antioch  in  verse 
40.  But  the  "some  days"  of  verse  36  afforded  abundant 
time  for  him  to  return  from  Jerusalem.  He  and  Judas  went 
first  to  Jerusalem  to  make  a  report  of  their  mission. 

35.  Tarried  (dietribon) .  Imperfect  active  of  diatribo,  old 
verb  to  pass  time,  seen  already  in  12:19;  ^4*3>  28.  With  many 
others  also  {meta  kai  heteron  pollon).  A  time  of  general  re- 
vival and  naturally  so  after  the  victory  at  Jerusalem.  It  is 
at  this  point  that  it  is  probable  that  the  sad  incident  took 
place  told  by  Paul  in  Gal.  2:11-21.  Peter  came  up  to  see 
how  things  were  going  in  Antioch  after  Paul's  victory  in 
Jerusalem.  At  first  Peter  mingled  freely  with  the  Greek 
Christians  without  the  compunctions  shown  at  Caesarea  and 
for  which  he  had  to  answer  in  Jerusalem  (Acts  11:1-18). 
Rumours  of  Peter's  conduct  reached  Jerusalem  and  the  Ju- 
daizers  saw  a  chance  to  reopen  the  controversy  on  the  line 
of  social  customs,  a  matter  not  passed  on  at  the  Jerusalem 
Conference.  These  Judaizers  threaten  Peter  with  a  new  trial 
and  he  surrenders  and  is  followed  by  Barnabas  and  all  the 
Jewish  brethren  in  Antioch  to  the  dismay  of  Paul  who  boldly 
rebuked  Peter  and  Barnabas  and  won  them  back  to  his  view. 
It  was  a  crisis.  Some  would  even  date  the  Epistle  to  the 
Galatians  at  this  time  also,  an  unlikely  hypothesis. 

36.  Let  us  return  now  and  visit  the  brethren  (epistrepsantes 
de  episkepsometha  tous  adelphous).  Paul  takes  the  initiative 
as  the  leader,  all  the  more  so  if  the  rebuke  to  Peter  and  Bar- 
nabas in  Gal.  2:11-21  had  already  taken  place.  Paul  is  anx- 
ious, like  a  true  missionary,  to  go  back  to  the  fields  where 
he  has  planted  the  gospel.  He  uses  the  hortatory  subjunc- 
tive {episkepsometha)  for  the  proposal  (see  on  15:14  for  this 
verb).  Note  the  repeated  epi  {epi-strepsantes  and  epi- 
skepsometha). There  is  special  point  in  the  use  of  de  (short- 
ened form  of  ede),  now  at  this  juncture  of  affairs  (cf.  13:2). 
How  they  fare  (pos  echousin).  Indirect  question,  "how  they 
have  it."    The  precariousness  of  the  life  of  new  converts  in 


240     WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

pagan  lands  is  shown  in  all  of  Paul's  Epistles  (Furneaux). 
So  he  wanted  to  go  city  by  city  (kata  polin  pdsan). 

37.  Was  minded  to  take  with  them  (ebouleto  sunparalahein). 
Imperfect  middle  {ebouleto)^  not  aorist  middle  ebouleusato 
of  the  Textus  Receptus.  Barnabas  willed,  wished  and  stuck 
to  it  (imperfect  tense).  Sunparalahein  is  second  aorist  active 
infinitive  of  the  double  compound  sunparalamhano,  old 
verb  to  take  along  together  with,  used  already  about  John 
Mark  in  12:25  ^^^  ^Y  ^^^^  in  Gal.  2:1  about  Titus.  No- 
where else  in  the  N.T.  Barnabas  used  the  ingressive  aorist 
in  his  suggestion. 

38.  But  Paul  thought  not  good  to  take  with  them  {Paulos  de 
exiou — me  sunparalambanein  teuton).  The  Greek  is  far  more 
effective  than  this  English  rendering.  It  is  the  imperfect  ac- 
tive of  axioo,  old  verb  to  think  meet  or  right  and  the  present 
active  infinitive  of  the  same  verb  {sunparalambanb)  with 
negative  used  with  this  infinitive.  Literally,  "But  Paul 
kept  on  deeming  it  wise  not  to  be  taking  along  with  them 
this  one."  Barnabas  looked  on  it  as  a  simple  punctiliar  pro- 
posal (aorist  infinitive),  but  Paul  felt  a  lively  realization  of 
the  problem  of  having  a  quitter  on  his  hands  (present  infini- 
tive). Each  was  insistent  in  his  position  (two  imperfects). 
Paul  had  a  definite  reason  for  his  view  describing  John  Mark 
as  **him  who  withdrew  from  them  from  Pamphylia"  {ton 
apostanta  ap' auton  apo  Pamphulias).  Second  aorist  active 
articular  participle  of  aphistemi,  intransitive  use,  "the  one 
who  stood  off  from,  apostatized  from"  (our  very  word 
"apostasy").  And  also  as  the  one  who  "went  not  with  them 
to  the  work"  {kai  me  sunelthonta  autois  eis  to  ergon).  At 
Perga  Mark  had  faced  the  same  task  that  Paul  and  Barna- 
bas did,  but  he  flinched  and  flickered  and  quit.  Paul  de- 
clined to  repeat  the  experiment  with  Mark. 

39.  J  sharp  contention  (paroxusmos) .  Our  very  word 
paroxysm  in  English.  Old  word  though  only  twice  in  the 
N.T.   (here  and  Heb.   10:24),  ^^om  paroxuno,  to  sharpen 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  241 

{paray  oxus)  as  of  a  blade  and  of  the  spirit  (Acts  17:16;  I  Cor. 
13:5).  This  "son  of  consolation"  loses  his  temper  in  a  dis- 
pute over  his  cousin  and  Paul  uses  sharp  words  towards  his 
benefactor  and  friend.  It  is  often  so  that  the  little  irritations 
of  life  give  occasion  to  violent  explosions.  If  the  incident  in 
Gal.  2:ii— 21  had  already  taken  place,  there  was  a  sore  place 
already  that  could  be  easily  rubbed.  And  if  Mark  also 
joined  with  Peter  and  Barnabas  on  that  occasion,  Paul 
had  fresh  ground  for  irritation  about  him.  But  there  is  no 
way  to  settle  differences  about  men  and  we  can  only  agree 
to  disagree  as  Paul  and  Barnabas  did.  So  that  they  parted 
asunder  from  one  another  (hoste  apochoristhenai  autous  ap* 
allelon).  Actual  result  here  stated  by  hoste  and  the  first  aorist 
passive  infinitive  of  apochorizo,  old  verb  to  sever,  to  separate, 
here  only  and  Rev.  6:4  in  the  N.T.  The  accusative  of  general 
reference  (autous)  is  normal.  For  construction  with  hoste 
see  Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  gggi.  And  Barnabas  took 
Mark  with  him  and  sailed  away  to  Cyprus  {ton  te  Barnaban 
paralabonta  ton  Markon  ekpleusai  eis  Kupron).  Second  in- 
finitival clause  ekpleusai  after  hoste  connected  by  te.  The 
same  participle  is  used  here  minus  sun,  paralabonta  (second 
aorist  active).  Barnabas  and  Mark  sailed  out  {ekpleusai 
from  ekpleo)  from  the  harbour  of  Antioch.  This  is  the  last 
glimpse  that  Luke  gives  us  of  Barnabas,  one  of  the  noblest 
figures  in  the  New  Testament.  Paul  has  a  kindly  reference 
to  him  in  I  Cor.  9:6.  No  one  can  rightly  blame  Barnabas 
for  giving  his  cousin  John  Mark  a  second  chance  nor  Paul 
for  fearing  to  risk  him  again.  One's  judgment  may  go  with 
Paul,  but  one's  heart  goes  with  Barnabas.  And  Mark  made 
good  with  Barnabas,  with  Peter  (I  Peter  5:13)  and  finally 
with  Paul  (Col.  4:10;  II  Tim.  4:11).  See  my  little  book  on 
John  Mark  {Making  Good  in  the  Ministry).  Paul  and  Bar- 
nabas parted  in  anger  and  both  in  sorrow.  Paul  owed  more 
to  Barnabas  than  to  any  other  man.  Barnabas  was  leaving 
the  greatest  spirit  of  the  time  and  of  all  times.

40.  Chose  {epilexamenos).  First  aorist  middle  (indirect) 
participle  of  epilego,  choosing  for  himself,  as  the  successor 
of  Barnabas,  not  of  Mark  who  had  no  place  in  Paul's  plans 
at  this  time.  Commended  {paradotheis).  First  aorist  passive 
of  paradidbmi,  the  same  verb  employed  about  Paul  and 
Barnabas  (14:26)  on  their  return  from  the  first  tour.  It  is 
clear  now  that  the  sympathy  of  the  church  at  Antioch  is 
with  Paul  rather  than  with  Barnabas  in  the  cleavage  that 
has  come.  The  church  probably  recalled  how  in  the  pinch 
Barnabas  flickered  and  went  to  the  side  of  Peter  and  that 
it  was  Paul  who  for  the  moment  stood  Paulus  contra  mun- 
dum  for  Gentile  liberty  in  Christ  against  the  threat  of  the 
Judaizers  from  Jerusalem.  Silas  had  influence  in  the  church 
in  Jerusalem  (verse  22)  and  was  apparently  a  Roman  citizen 
(16:37)  *'^so.  He  is  the  Silas  or  Silvanus  of  the  epistles  (I 
Thess.  1:1;  II  Thess.  1:1;  II  Cor.  1:19;  I  Peter  5:12).  It  is 
remarkable  that  Peter  mentions  both  Mark  and  Silas  as  with 
him  (I  Peter  5:i2f.)  at  the  same  time. 

41.  Went  through  (diercheto).  Imperfect  middle.  So  Paul 
went  forth  on  his  second  mission  tour  with  heart-aches  and 
high  hopes  mingled  together.  Syria  and  Cilicia  {ten  Surian 
kai  ten  Kilikian).  He  took  the  opposite  course  from  the  first 
tour,  leaving  Cyprus  to  Barnabas  and  Mark.  Probably 
Paul  had  established  these  churches  while  in  Tarsus  after 
leaving  Jerusalem  (Acts  9:30;  Gal.  1:21).  Paul  would  go 
"by  the  Gulf  of  Issus  through  the  Syrian  Gates,  a  narrow 
road  between  steep  rocks  and  the  sea,  and  then  inland, 
probably  past  Tarsus  and  over  Mt.  Taurus  by  the  Cilician 
gates"  (Page),  This  second  tour  will  occupy  Luke's  story 
in  Acts  through  18:22. 


CHAPTER  XVI 

1.  And  he  came  also  to  Derbe  and  Lystra  {katentesen  de  kai 
eis  Derben  kai  eis  Lustran).  First  aorist  active  of  katantdo, 
late  verb  to  come  down  to,  to  arrive  at.  He  struck  Derbe 
first  of  the  places  in  the  first  tour  which  was  the  last  city- 
reached  then.  Timothy  (Timotheos).  Apparently  a  native 
of  Lystra  ("there,"  ekei),  his  Hebrew  mother  named  Eunice 
and  grandmother  Lois  (H  Tim.  i  :$)  and  his  Greek  father's 
name  not  known.  He  may  have  been  a  proselyte,  but  not 
necessarily  so  as  Timothy  was  taught  the  Scriptures  by  his 
mother  and  grandn^ther  (H  Tim.  3:15),  and,  if  a  proselyte, 
he  would  have  had  Timothy  circumcised.  It  is  idle  to  ask 
if  Paul  came  on  purpose  to  get  Timothy  to  take  Mark's 
place.  Probably  Timothy  was  about  eighteen  years  of  age, 
a  convert  of  Paul's  former  visit  a  few  years  before  (I 
Tim.  1:2)  and  still  young  twelve  years  later  (I  Tim.  4:12). 
Paul  loved  him  devotedly  (I  Tim.  1:3;  5 123 ;  II  Tim.  3:15; 
Phil.  2:i9f.).  It  is  a  glorious  discovery  to  find  a  real  young 
preacher  for  Christ's  work. 

2.  fFas  well  reported  of  {emartureito).  Imperfect  passive. 
It  was  a  continuous  witness  that  was  borne  the  young  disciple 
both  in  his  home  town  of  Lystra  and  In  Derbe.  Already  he 
had  so  borne  himself  that  his  gifts  and  graces  for  the  minis- 
try were  recognized.  It  is  a  wise  precaution  that  the  ap- 
proval of  the  local  church  is  necessary  for  the  licensing  and 
the  ordaining  of  a  preacher.  If  God  has  called  a  man  for  the 
work  signs  of  it  will  be  manifest  to  others. 

3.  Him  would  Paul  have  to  go  forth  with  him  {touton  ethel- 
esen  ho  Paulos  sun  autoi  exelthein).  This  one  (note  emphatic 
position)  Paul  wanted  (first  aorist  active  indicative  of  thelo 
with  temporal  augment  as  if  from  ethelo  the  old  form).   Here 

243

was  a  gifted  young  man  who  was  both  Jew  and  Greek.  He 
took  and  circumcised  him  {labon  perietem^n  auton).  Any- 
one could  perform  this  rite.  Paul  had  stoutly  resisted  cir- 
cumcision in  the  case  of  Titus,  a  pure  Greek  (Gal.  2:3,  5),  be- 
cause the  whole  principle  of  Gentile  liberty  was  at  stake. 
But  Timothy  was  both  Jew  and  Greek  and  would  continually 
give  offence  to  the  Jews  with  no  advantage  to  the  cause  of 
Gentile  freedom.  So  here  for  the  sake  of  expediency,  "be- 
cause of  the  Jews"  {dia  tous  loudaious),  Paul  voluntarily  re- 
moved this  stumbling-block  to  the  ministry  of  Timothy. 
Otherwise  Timothy  could  not  have  been  allowed  to  preach 
m  the  synagogues.  Idem  non  est  semper  idem.  But  Timothy's 
case  was  not  the  case  of  Titus.  Here  it  was  a  question  of 
efficient  service,  not  an  essential  of  salvation.  Hovey  notes 
that  Timothy  was  circumcised  because  of  Jewish  unbe- 
lievers, not  because  of  Jewish  believers.  Was  a  Greek  {Hellen 
huperchen).  Imperfect  active  in  indirect  assertion  where 
ordinarily  the  present  huparchei  would  be  retained,  pos- 
sibly indicating  that  his  father  was  no  longer  living. 

4.  They  delivered  them  {paredidosan  autois).  Imperfect 
active,  kept  on  delivering  to  them  in  city  after  city.  This  is  a 
proof  of  Paul's  loyalty  to  the  Jerusalem  compact  (Knowling). 
The  circumcision  of  Timothy  would  indicate  also  that  the 
points  involved  were  under  discussion  and  that  Paul  felt 
no  inconsistency  in  what  he  did.  The  decrees  {ta  dogmata). 
Old  word  from  doked,  to  give  an  opinion.  It  is  used  of  public 
decrees  of  rulers  (Luke  2:1;  Acts  17:7),  of  the  requirements 
of  the  Mosaic  law  (Col.  2:14),  and  here  of  the  regulations  or 
conclusions  of  the  Jerusalem  Conference.  Silas  was  with 
Paul  and  his  presence  gave  added  dignity  to  the  passing  out 
of  the  decrees,  a  charter  of  Gentile  freedom,  since  he  was 
one  of  the  committee  from  Jerusalem  to  Antioch  (15:22, 
27,  32).  Which  had  been  ordained  {ta  kekrimena).  Perfect 
passive  articular  participle  of  krino,  to  judge,  emphasizing 
the  permanence  of  the  conclusions  reached  by  the  apostles 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  245 

and  elders  in  Jerusalem.  For  to  keep  (phulassein) .  This 
present  active  infinitive  likewise  accents  that  it  is  a  charter 
of  liberty  for  continual  living,  not  a  temporary  compromise. 

5.  fVere  strengthened  {estereounto).  Imperfect  passive  of 
stereoo,  old  verb  to  make  firm  and  solid  like  the  muscles 
(Acts  3:7,  16),  these  three  the  only  examples  in  the  N.T. 
Increased  (eperisseuon).  Imperfect  active  of  the  old  and 
common  verb  perisseuo  from  perissos  (overplus).  The  bless- 
ing of  God  was  on  the  work  of  Paul,  Silas,  and  Timothy  in 
the  form  of  a  continuous  revival. 

6.  The  region  of  Phrygia  and  Galatia  {ten  Phrugian  kai 
Galatiken  choran).  This  is  probably  the  correct  text  with 
one  article  and  apparently  describes  one  "Region"  or  Dis- 
trict in  The  Province  of  Galatia  which  was  also  Phrygian 
(the  old-ethnographic  name  with  which  compare  the  use  of 
Lycaonia  in  14:6).  Strictly  speaking  Derbe  and  Lystra, 
though  in  the  Province  of  Galatia,  were  not  Phrygian,  and 
so  Luke  would  here  be  not  resumptive  of  the  record  in  verses 
1-5;  but  a  reference  to  the  country  around  Iconium  and 
Antioch  in  Pisidia  in  North  Galatia  is  not  included.  This 
verse  is  hotly  disputed  at  every  point  by  the  advocates  of 
the  North  Galatian  theory  as  represented  by  Chase  and  the 
South  Galatian  theory  by  Ramsay.  Whatever  is  true  in 
regard  to  the  language  of  Luke  here  and  in  18:23,  it  is  still 
possible  for  Paul  in  Gal.  i  :2  to  use  the  term  Galatia  of  the 
whole  province  of  that  name  which  could,  in  fact,  apply  to 
either  South  or  North  Galatia  or  to  both.  He  could,  of 
course,  use  it  also  in  the  ethnographic  sense  of  the  real 
Gauls  or  Celts  who  dwelt  in  North  Galatia.  Certainly  the 
first  tour  of  Paul  and  Barnabas  was  in  the  Province  of 
Galatia  though  touching  only  the  Regions  of  Pisidia, 
Phrygia,  and  Lycaonia,  which  province  included  besides  the 
Gauls  to  the  north.  In  this  second  tour  Lycaonia  has  been 
already  touched  (Derbe  and  Lystra)  and  now  Phrygia. 
The  question  arises  why  Luke  here  and  in  18:23  adds  the 


246      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

term  "of  Galatia"  {Galatiken)  though  not  in  13:14  (Pisidian 
Antioch)  nor  in  14:6  (cities  of  Lycaonia).  Does  Luke  mean 
to  use  "of  Galatia"  in  the  same  ethnographic  sense  as  "of 
Phrygia"  or  does  he  here  add  the  province  (Galatia)  to  the 
name  of  the  Region  (Phrygia)  ?  In  itself  either  view  is  possi- 
ble and  it  really  matters  very  little  except  that  the  question 
is  raised  whether  Paul  went  into  the  North  Galatian  Region 
^n  this  occasion  or  later  (18:23).  He  could  have  done  so  and 
the  Epistle  be  addressed  to  the  churches  of  South  Galatia, 
North  Galatia,  or  the  province  as  a  whole.  But  the  Greek 
participle  koluthenUs  ('^Jhajdag  beeri^  forbidden ")  plays  a 
part  in  the  argument  that  cannot  be  overlooked  whether 
Luke  means  to  say  that  Paul  went  north  or  not.  This  aorist 
passive  participle  of  ^o/uo,  to  hinder,  can  only  express  simulta- 
neous or  antecedent  action,  not  subsequent  action  as  Ram- 
say argues.  No  example  of  the  so-called  subsequent  use  of 
the  aorist  participle  has  ever  been  found  in  Greek  as  all 
Greek  grammarians  agree  (Robertson,  Grammar^  pp.  860-63, 
II 12-14).  Th^  o^ly  natural  meaning  of  kbluthentes  is  that 
Paul  withSilas  and  Timothy  "passed  through  the  region  of 
Phrygia  and  Galatia"  because  tKey  were  hindered  by  the 
Holy  Spirit  from  speaking  the  word  in  Asia  (the  Province 
of  Alia  of  whicir~Epiiebus  was  the  chief  city  and  west  of 
Derbe  and  Lystra).  This  construction  implies  that  the 
country  called  "the  region  of  Phrygia  and  Galatia"  is  not 
in  the  direct  line  west  toward  Ephesus.  What  follows  in 
verse  7  throws  further  light  on  the  point. 

7.  Over  against  Mysia  {kata  ten  Musian).  This  was  an  ill- 
defined  region  rather  north  and  west  of  Phrygia.  The  Ro- 
mans finally  absorbed  most  of  it  in  the  Province  of  Asia. 
They  assayed  to  go  into  Bithynia  {epeirazon  eis  ten  Bithunian 
poreuthenai) .  Conative  imperfect  of  peirazo  and  ingressive 
aorist  passive  infinitive  of  poreuomai.  Now  Bithynia  is  north- 
cast  of  Mysia  and  north  of  Galatia  (province).  Clearly 
Luke  means  to  say  that  Paul  had,  when  hindered  by  the 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  247 

Holy  Spirit  from  going  west  into  Asia,  gone  north  so  as  to 
come  in  front  of  Bithynia.  This  journey  would  take  him 
directly  through  Phrygia  and  the  North  Galatian  country 
(the  real  Gauls  or  Celts).  This  is,  to  my  mind,  the  strongest 
argument  for  the  North  Galatian  view  in  these  verses  6  and 
7.  The  grammar  and  the  topography  bring  Paul  right  up  to 
Bithynia  (north  of  the  old  Galatia).  It  is  verses  6  and  7 
that  make  me  pause  before  accepting  the  plausible  argu- 
ments of  Ramsay  for  the  South  Galatian  theory.  In  itself 
the  problem  is  nothing  like  so  important  or  so  determinative 
as  he  makes  it.  But  shall  we  smash  Luke's  grammar  to 
pieces  to  bolster  up  a  theory  of  criticism?  And  the  Spirit  of 
Jesus  suffered  them  not  (kai  ouk  eiasen  autousto  pneuma  lesou). 
The  same  Spirit  who  in  verse  6  had  forbidden  going  into 
Asia  now  closed  the  door  into  Bithynia.  This  expression 
occurs  nowhere  else,  but  we  have  the  spirit  of  Christ  (Rom. 
8:9)  and  the  Spirit  of  Jesus  Christ  (Phil.  1:19).  Eiasen  is 
first  aorist  active  indicative  of  eao,  old  verb  to  allow. 

8.  Passing  by  Mysia  {parelthontes  ten  Musian).  Literally, 
passing  alongside  or  skirting  Mysia,  neglecting  it  without 
preaching  there.  Strictly  they  passed  through  part  of  it  to 
reach  Troas.  To  Troas  (eis  Troiada).  This  city,  named 
Alexandria  Troas  after  Alexander  the  Great,  was  the  sea- 
port of  Mysia,  though  a  Roman  colony  and  not  counted 
as  part  of  either  Asia  or  Bithynia.  New  Ilium,  on  the  site 
of  the  old  Troy,  was  four  miles  farther  north.  It  was  the 
place  to  take  ship  for  Philippi.  Twice  again  Paul  will  be 
here  (II  Cor.  2:12;  Acts  20:6). 

9.  A  vision  (horama).  Old  word,  eleven  times  in  Acts, 
once  in  Matt.  17:9.  Twice  Paul  had  been  hindered  by  the 
Holy  Spirit  from  going  where  he  wanted  to  go-  Most  men 
would  have  gone  back  home  with  such  rebuffs,  but  not  so 
Paul.  Now  the  call  is  positive  and  not  negative,  to  go  "far 
hence  to  the  Gentiles"  (22:21).  He  had  little  dreamed  of 
such  a  call  when  he  left  Antioch.     Paul's  frequent  visions 


248      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

always  came  at  real  crises  in  his  life.  A  man  of  Macedonia 
{aner  Makedon).  Ramsay  follows  Renan  in  the  view  that 
this  was  Luke  with  whom  Paul  had  conversed  about  condi- 
tions in  Macedonia.  Verse  10  makes  it  plain  that  Luke  was 
now  in  the  party,  but  when  he  joined  them  we  do  not  know. 
Some  hold  that  Luke  lived  at  Antioch  in  Syria  and  came  on 
with  Paul  and  Silas,  others  that  he  joined  them  later  in 
Galatia,  others  that  he  appeared  now  either  as  Paul's  physi- 
cian or  new  convert.  Ramsay  thinks  that  Philippi  was  his 
home  at  this  time.  But,  whatever  is  true  about  Luke,  the 
narrative  must  not  be  robbed  of  its  supernatural  aspect 
(10:10;  22:17).  Was  standing  {en  hestos).  Second  perfect 
active  participle  of  histemi,  intransitive,  periphrastic  im- 
perfect. Vivid  picture.  Help  us  {boetheson  hemin).  Ingres- 
sive  first  aorist  active  imperative  of  boetheo  {boe^  thed),  to 
run  at  a  cry,  to  help.  The  man  uses  the  plural  for  all  in- 
cluding himself.  It  was  the  cry  of  Europe  for  Christ. 

10.  fVe  sought  (ezetesamen).  This  sudden  use  of  the  plural, 
dropped  in  17:1  when  Paul  leaves  Philippi,  and  resumed  in 
20:5  when  Paul  rejoins  Luke  in  Philippi,  argues  conclusively 
that  Luke,  the  author,  is  in  the  party  ("we"  portions  of  Acts) 
and  shows  in  a  writer  of  such  literary  skill  as  Luke  that  he  is 
not  copying  a  document  in  a  blundering  sort  of  way.  Paul 
told  his  vision  to  the  party  and  they^were  all  ready  to  re- 
spond to  the  call.  Concluding  (sunbibazontes) .  A  very  strik- 
ing word,  present  active  participle  of  sunbibazo,  old  verb  to 
make  go  together,  jto^alesce  or  knit  together,  to  make  this 
and  that  agree  and  so  to  conclude.  Already  in  9:22  of  Paul's 
preaching.  This  word  here  gives  a  good  illustration  of  the 
proper  use  of  the  reason  in  connection  with  revelation,  to 
decide  whether  it  is  a  revelation  from  God,  to  find  out  what 
it  means  for  us,  and  to  see  that  we  obey  the  revelation 
when  understood.  God  had  called  them  to  preach  to  the 
Macedonians.    They  had  to  go. 

11.  Setting  sail  (anachthentes).    Same  word  in  13:13  which 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  249 

see.  We  made  a  straight  course  (euthudromesamen).  First 
aorist  active  indicative  of  compound  verb  euthudromeo  (in 
Philo)  from  adjective  euthudromos  (in  Strabo),  running  a 
straight  course  (euthus,  dromos).  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and 
21:1.  It  is  a  nautical  term  ior  sailing  hefnrp  thp  wind.  Luke 
has  a  true  feeling  for  the  sea.  To  Samothrace  {eis  Samo- 
thrdiken).  A  small  island  in  the  Aegean  about  halfway 
between  Troas  and  Neapolis.  The  day  following  (tei  epiou- 
sei).  Locative  case  of  time  with  hemerdi  (day)  to  be  sup- 
plied (7:26;  20:15;  21:18;  23:11).  With  adverse  winds  it 
took  five  days  to'  make  the  run  of  125  miles  (20:6).  To 
Neapolis  {eis  NeanPolin).  To  New  Town  (Newton,  Naples, 
Neapolis).  The  port  of  Philippi  ten  miles  distant,  Thracian, 
but  reckoned  as  Macedonian  after  Vespasian. 

12.  To  Philippi  {eis  Philippous).  The  plural  like  Athenai 
(Athens)  is  probably  due  to  separate  sections  of  the  city 
united  (Winer-Moulton,  Grammar ,  p.  220).  The  city  (ancient 
name  Krenides  or  Wells)  was  renamed  after  himself  by 
Philip,  the  father  of  Alexander  the  Great.  It  was  situated 
about  a  mile  east  of  the  small  stream  Gangites  which  flows 
into  the  river  Strymon  some  thirty  miles  away.  In  this  valley 
the  Battle  of  Philippi  was  fought  B.C.  42  between  the  Second 
Triumvirate  (Octavius,  Antonius,  Lepidus)  and  Brutus 
and  Cassius.  In  memory  of  the  victory  Octavius  made  it  a 
colony  {kolonia)  with  all  the  privileges  of  Roman  citizenship, 
such  as  freedom  from  scourging,  freedom  from  arrest  save 
in  extreme  cases,  and  the  right  of  appeal  to  the  emperor. 
This  Latin  word  occurs  here  alone  in  the  N.T.  Octavius 
planted  here  a  colony  of  Roman  veterans  with  farms 
attached,  a  military  outpost  and  a  miniature  of  Rome  it- 
self. The  language  was  Latin.  Here  Paul  is  face  to  face  with 
the  Roman  power  and  empire  in  a  new  sense.  He  was  a  new 
Alexander,  come  from  Asia  to  conquer  Europe  for  Christ, 
a  new  Caesar  to  build  the  Kingdom  of  Christ  on  the  work  of 
Alexander  and  Caesar.    One  need  not  think  that  Paul  was 


250      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

conscious  of  all  that  was  involved  in  destiny  for  the  world. 
Phillppi  was  on  the  Egnatian  Way,  one  of  the  great  Roman 
roads,  tTiat  ran  from  here  to  Dyrrachium  on  the  shores  of 
the  Adriatic,  a  road  that  linked  the  east  with  the  west.  Tht 
first  of  the  district  {prote  tis  truridos).  Philippi  was  not  the 
first  city  of  Macedonia  nor  does  Luke  say  so.  That  honour 
belonged  to  Thessalonica  and  even  Amphipolis  was  larger 
than  Philippi.  It  is  not  clear  whether  by  meris  Luke  means 
a  formal  division  of  the  province,  though  the  KoinS  has 
examples  of  this  geographical  sense  (papyri).  There  is 
no  article  with  prote  and  Luke  may  not  mean  to  stress  unduly 
the  position  of  Philippi  in  comparison  with  Amphipolis. 
But  it  was  certainly  a  leading  city  of  this  district  of  Mace- 
donia. fVe  were  tarrying  {emen  diatribontes).  Periphrastic 
imperfect  active. 

13.  By  a  river  side  {para  potamon).  The  little  river  Gan- 
gites  (or  Gargites)  was  one  mile  west  of  the  town.  Philippi 
as  a  military  outpost  had  few  Jews.  There  was  evidentfy 
no  synagogue  inside  the  city,  but  "without  the  gates" 
(exo  tes  pules)  they  had  noticed  an  enclosure  "where  we 
supposed  "  {hou  enomizomen,  correct  text,  imperfect  active), 
probably  as  they  came  into  the  city,  "was  a  place  of  prayer" 
(proseucken  einai).  Infinitive  with  accusative  of  general 
reference  in  indirect  discourse.  Proseuche  is  common  in  the 
LXX  and  the  N.T.  for  the  act  of  prayer  as  in  Acts  2:42, 
then  for  a  place  of  prayer  either  a  synagogue  (III  Mace. 
7:20)  or  more  often  an  open  air  enclosure  near  the  sea  or  a 
river  where^  there  was  water  for  ceremoniaLablutions.  The 
word  occurs  also  in  heathen  writers  for  a  place  of  prayer 
(Schiirer,  Jewish  People,  Div.  II,  Vol.  II,  p.  69,  Engl.  Tr.). 
Deissmann  {Bible  Studies,  p.  222)  quotes  an  Egyptian  in- 
scription of  the  third  century  B.C.  with  this  sense  of  the  word 
and  one  from  Panticapaeum  on  the  Black  Sea  of  the  first 
century  a.d.  {Light  from  the  Ancient  East,  p.  102).  Juvenal 
(III.  296)  has  a  sneering  reference  to  the  Jewish  proseucha. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  25 1 

Josephus  {Ant.  XIV.  10,  23)  quotes  a  decree  of  Halicarnas- 
sus  which  allowed  the  Jews  "to  make  their  prayers  (proseu- 
chas)  on  the  seashore  according  to  the  custom  of  their 
fathers."  There  was  a  synagogue  in  Thessalonica,  but  ap- 
parently none  in  Amphipolis  and  Apollonia  (Acts  17:1). 
The  rule,  of  the  rabbis  required  ten  men  to  constitute  a  syna- 
gogue, but  here  were  gathered  only  a  group  of  women  at 
the  hour  of  prayer.  ln_pioneer  days  in_jthis__CQmilry  it  was  a 
common  thing  to  preach  underlJusFaTbours  in  the  open  air.  "^ 
John  Wesley  and  George  Whitfield  were  great  open  air 
preachers.  Paul  did  not  have  an  inspiring  beginning  for  his 
work  in  Europe,  butjie  took  hold  where  he  could-  The  con- 
jecture was  correct.  It  was  a  place  of  prayer,  but  only  a 
bunch  of  women  had  come  together  {tais  sunelthousais  gun- 
aixin),  excuse  enough  for  not  preaching  to  some  preachers,/ 
but  not  to  Paul  and  his  party.  The  "man  of  Macedonia" 
turned  out  to  be  a  group  of  women  (Furneaux).  Mace- 
donian inscriptions  show  greater  freedoni^r  women  in  Mape- 
donia  than  eisgwliere  at  this  time  and  confirm  Luke's  story 
of  the  activities  of  women  in  Philippi,  Thessalonica,  Berea. 
We  sat  down  and  spake  {kathisantes  elaloumen).  Having  taken 
our_seals  (aorist  active  participle  of  kathizo)  we  began  to 
speak  or  preach  (inchoative  imperfect  of  laleo,  often  used 
for  preaching).  Sitting  was  the  Jewish  attitude  for  public 
speaking.  It  was  not  mere  conversation,  but  more  likely  con- 
versational preaching  of  an  historical  and  expository  char- 
acter! Luk?s~use  of^he  first  person  plural  implies  that 
each  of  the  four  (Paul,  Silas,  Timothy,  Luke)  preached  in 
turn,  with  Paul  as  chief  speaker. 

14.  Lydia  (Ludia).  Her  birthplace  was  Thyatira  in  Lydia. 
She  may  have  been  named  after  the  land,  though  Lydia  is 
a  common  female  name  (see  Horace).  Lydia  was  itself  a 
Macedonian  colony  (Strabo,  XIII.  4).  Thyatira  (note  plural 
form  like  Philippi  and  one  of  the  seven  churches  of  Asia 
here  Rev.  2:18)  was  famous  for  its  purple  dyes  as  old  as 


252      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Homer  (Iliad,  IV.  141)  and  had  a  guild  of  dyers  {hoi  hapheis) 
as  inscriptions  show.  A  seller  of  purple  (porphuropolis).  A 
female  seller  of  purple  fabrics  (porphura,  polis).  Late  word, 
masculine  form  in  an  inscription.  There  was  a  great  demand 
for  this  fabric  as  it  was  used  on  the  official  toga  at  Rome  and 
in  Roman  colonies.  We  still  use  the  term  "royal  purple." 
See  on  Luke  16:19.  Evidently  Lydia  was  a  woman  of  some 
means  to  carry  on  such  an  important  enterprise  from  her 
native  city.  She  may  have  been  a  freed-woman,  since 
racial  names  were  often  borne  by  slaves.  One  that  worshipped 
God  {sebomene  ton  theon).  ^God-fearer  or  proselyte  of  the 
gate.  There  was  a  Jewish  settlement  in  Thyatira  which 
was  especially  interested  in  the  dyeing  industry.  She  prob" 
ably  became  a  proselyte  there.  Whether  this  was  true  of 
the  other  women  we  do  not  know.  They  may  have  been 
Jewesses  or  proselytes  like  Lydia,  probably  all  of  them 
employees  of  hers  in  her  business.  When  Paul  writes  to 
the  Philippians  he  does  not  mention  Lydia  who  may  have 
died  meanwhile  and  who  certainly  was  not  Paul's  wife.  She 
was  wealthy  and  probably  a  widow.     Heard  us  (ekouen). 

JLrnperfect^active  of  akouOj  was  listening,  really  listening  and 
she  keptit  up,  listening  to  each  oTtEese  new  and  strange 
preachers.  Opened  (dienoixen).  First  aorist  active  indicative 
of  dianoigo,  old  word,  dcuiblecompound  (dia^  ana^  oigo)  to 

_open_up  wide  or  completely  like  a  folding  door  (both  sides, 
diay  two).  Only  the  Lord  could  do  that.  Jesus  had  opened 
(the  same  verb)  the  mind  of  the  disciples  to  understand  the 
Scriptures  (Luke  24:45).  To  give  heed  (prcsechein) .  To  hold 
the  mind  (ton  noun  understood),  present  active  infinitive. 
She  kept  her  mind  centred  on  the  things  spoken  by  Paul 
whose  words  gripped  her  attention.  She  rightly  perceived 
that  Paul  was  the  foremost  one  of  the  group.  He  had  personal 
magnetism  and  power  of  intellect  that  the  Spirit  of  God  used 
to  win  the  heart  of  this  remarkable  woman  to  Christ.  It 
was  worth  coming  to  Philippi  to  win  this  fine  personality  to 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  253 

the  Kingdom  of  God.  She  will  be  the  chief  spirit  in  this 
church  that  will  give  Paul  more  joy  and  co-operation  than 
any  of  his  churches.  It  is  not  stated  that  she  was  converted 
on  the  first  Sabbath,  though  this  may  have  been  the  case. 
"One  solitary  convert,  a  woman,  and  she  already  a  seeker 
after  God,  and  a  native  of  that  very  Asia  where  they  had 
been  forbidden  to  preach"  (Furneaux).  But  a  new  era 
had  dawned  for  Europe  and  for  women  in  the  conversion 
of  Lydia.  ^ 

15.  And  when  she  was  baptized  {hds  de  ebaptisthe).  First 
aorist  passive  indicative  of  baptizo.  The  river  Gangites  was 
handy  for  the  ordinance  and  she  had  now  been  converted 
and  was  ready  to  make  this  public  declaration  of  her  faith 
in  Jesus  Christ.  Jnd  her  household  {kai  ho  oikos  antes).  Who 
constituted  her  "household"  ^  The  term  oikoSy  originally 
means  the  building  as  below,  "into  my  house"  and  then  it 
includes  the  inmates  of  a  house.  There  is  nothing  here  to 
show  whether  Lydia's  "household"  went  beyond  "the 
women  "  employed  by  her  who  like  her  had  heard  the  preach- 
ing of  Paul  and  had  believed.  "Possibly  Euodia  and  Syn- 
tyche  and  the  other  women,  Phil.  4:2,  3,  may  have  been  in- 
cluded in  the  family  of  Lydia,  who  may  have  employed  many 
slaves  and  freed  women  in  her  trade"  (Knowling).  "This 
statement  cannot  be  claimed  as  any  argument  for  infant 
baptism,  since  the  Greek  word  may  mean  her  servants  or 
her  work-people"  (Furneaux).  In  the  household  baptisms 
(Cornelius,  Lydia,  the  jailor,  Crispus)  one  sees  "infants" 
or  not  according  to  his  predilections  or  preferences.  //  ye 
have  judged  me  (ei  kekrikate  me).  Condition  of  the  first  class, 
assumed  to  be  true  (ei  and  the  indicative,  here  perfect  active 
of  krino).  She  had  confessed  her  faith  and  submitted  to 
baptism  as  proof  that  she  was  "faithful  to  the  Lord"  (pisten 
toi  kurioi),  believing  on  the  Lord.  "  If  she  was  fit  for  that, 
surely  she  was  fit  to  be  their  hostess"  (Furneaux).  And  Paul 
and  his  party  had  clearly  no  comfortable  place  to  stay  while 


254      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

in  Philippi.  The  ancient  hotels  or  inns  were  abominable. 
Evidently  Paul  demurred  for  there  were  four  of  them  and  he 
did  not  wish  to  sacrifice  his  independence  or  be  a  burden  even 
to  a  woman  of  wealth.  And  she  constrained  us  (kai  parebia- 
sato  hemas).  Effective  first  aorist  middle  of  parabiazomai^ 
late  word,  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  24:29.  Some  moral 
force  {bid)  or  hospitable  persuasion  was  required  (cf.  I  Sam. 
28:23),  but  Lydia  had  her  way  as  women  usually  do.  So  he 
accepted  Lydia's  hospitality  in  Philippi,  though  he  worked 
for  his  own  living  in  Thessalonica  (II  Thess.  3:8)  and  else- 
where (II  Cor.  1 1 :9).  So  far  only  women  have  been  won  to 
Christ  in  Philippi.  The  use  of  "us"  shows  that  Luke  was  not 
a  householder  in  Philippi. 

16.  A  spirit  of  divination  (pneuma  puthona).  So  the  cor- 
rect text  with  accusative  (apparition,  a  spirit,  a  python),  not 
the  genitive  (puthonos).  Hesychius  defines  it  as  daimonion 
manikon  (a  spirit  of  divination).  The  etymology  of  the  word 
is  unknown.  Bengel  suggests  puthesthai  from  punthanomai, 
-^to  inquire.  Python  was  the  name  given  to  the  serpent  that 
kept  guard  at  Delphi,  slain  by  Apollo,  who  was  called 
Puthios  Apollo  and  the  prophetess  at  Delphi  was  termed 
Pythia.  Certainly  Luke  does  not  mean  to  credit  Apollo 
with  a  real  existence  (I  Cor.  8:4).  But  Plutarch  (a.d.  50-100) 
says  that  the  term  puthones  was  applied  to  ventriloquists 
(eggastrimuthoi).  In  the  LXX  those  with  familiar  spirits  are 
called  by  this  word  ventriloquists  (Lev.  19:31,  20:6,  27,  in- 
cluding the  witch  of  Endor  I  Sam.  28:7).  It  is  possible  that 
this  slave  girljiad_th]s  gift  of  prophecy  "by  soothsaying" 
(manteuomene).  Present  middle  participle  of  manteuomaiy 
old  heathen  word  (in  contrast  with  propheteuo)  for  acting 
the  seer  {mantis)  and  this  kin  to  mainomai,  to  be  mad,  like 
the  howling  dervishes  of  later  times.  This  is  the  so-called 
instrumental  use  of  the  circumstantial  participles.  Brought 
{pareichen).  Imperfect  active  of  parecho,  a  steady  source  of 
income.    Much  gain  {ergasian  pollen).   Work,  business,  from

ergazomai,  to  work.  Her  masters  {tois  kuriois  antes).  Dative 
case.  Joint  owners  of  this  poor  slave  girl  who  were  exploit- 
ing her  calamity,  whatever  it  was,  for  selfish  gain,  just  as 
men  and  women  today  exploit  girls  and  women  in  the  "white 
slave"  trade.  As  a  fortune-teller  she  was  a  valuable  asset 
for  all  the  credulous  dupes  of  the  community.  Simon  Magus 
in  Samaria  and  Elymas  Barjesus  in  Cyprus  had  won  power 
and  wealth  as  soothsayers. 

17.  The  Most  High  God  {ton  theou  ton  hupsistou).  Pagan 
inscriptions  use  this  language  for  the  Supreme  Being.  It 
looks  like  supernatural  testimony  like  that  borne  by  the 
demoniacs  to  Jesus  as  "son  of  the  Most  High  God"  (Luke 
8:28.  Cfi  also  Mark  1:24;  3:11;  Matt.  8:29;  Luke  4:41,  etc.). 
She  may  have  heard  Paul  preach  about  Jesus  as  the  way  of 
salvation.  The  way  of  salvation  (hodon  soterias),  A  way  of 
salvation,  strictly  speaking  (no  article).  There  were  many 
"ways  of  salvation"  offered  to  men  then  as  now. 

18.  She  did  (epoiei).  Imperfect  active,  kept  it  up  for  many 
days.  The  strange  conduct  gave  Paul  and  the  rest  an  un- 
pleasant prominence  in  the  community.  Being  sore  troubled 
(diaponetheis) .  First  aorist  passive  of  diaponeb,  old  verb, 
to  work  laboriously,  then  in  passive  to  be  "worked  up," 
displeased,  worn  out.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  4:2  which 
see  (there  of  the  Sadducees  about  Peter*s  preaching).  Paul 
was  grieved,  annoyed,  indignant.  He  wanted  no  testimony 
from  a  source  like  this  any  more  than  he  did  the  homage  of 
the  people  of  Lystra  (14:14).  That  very  hour  {autei  tei  hordi). 
Locative  case  of  time  and  familiar  Lukan  idiom  in  his  Gospel, 
"at  the  hour  itself."  The  cure  was  instantaneous.  Paul, 
like  Jesus,  distinguished  between  the  demon  and  the  indi- 
vidual. 

19.  Was  gone  {exelthen).  Was  gone  out  of  the  slave  girl, 
second  aorist  active  indicative  of  exerchomai.  "The  two 
most  important  social  revolutions  worked  by  Christianity 
have   been   the  elevation  of  woman   and  the  abolition  of 


256      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

slavery"  (Furneaux).  Both  are  illustrated  here  (Lydia  and 
this  slave  girl).  "The  most  sensitive  part  of  'civilized'  man 
is  the  pocket"  (Ramsay).  Laid  hold  on  {epilabomenoi) . 
Second  aorist  middle  participle  of  epilamhano  as  in  9:27  and 
17:19,  but  here  with  hostile  intent.  Dragged  {heilkusan). 
First  aorist  active  indicative  of  helkuo,  late  form  of  the  old 
verb  helko  (also  in  James  2:6)  to  draw  as  a  sword,  and  then 
to  drag  one  forcibly  as  here  and  21:30.  It  is  also  used  of 
spiritual  drawing  as  by  Jesus  in  John  12:32.  Here  it  is  by 
violence.  Into  the  marketplace  {eis  ten  agoran).  Into  the 
Roman  forum  near  which  would  be  the  courts  of  law  as  in 
our  courthouse  square,  as  in  17:17.  Marketing  went  on  also 
(Mark  7:4),  when  the  crowds  collect  (Mark  6:56),  from 
ageird,  to  collect  or  gather.  Unto  the  rulers  {epi  tous  archontas). 
General  Greek  term  for  "the  magistrates." 

20.  Unto  the  magistrates  (tois  strategois).  Greek  term 
{stratos,  ago)  for  leader  of  an  army  or  general.  But  in  civic 
life  a  governor.  The  technical  name  for  the  magistrates  in  a 
Roman  colony  was  duumviri  or  duumvirs,  answering  to 
consuls  in  Rome.  Strategoi  here  is  the  Greek  rendering  of 
the  Latin  praetor es  (praetors),  a  term  which  they  preferred 
out  of  pride  to  the  term  duumviri.  Since  they  represented 
consuls,  the  praetors  or  duumvirs  were  accompanied  by 
lictors  bearing  rods  (verse  35).  These  men  (houtoi  hoi  an- 
thrdpoi).  Contemptuous  use.  Being  Jews  {loudaioi  hupar- 
chontes).  The  people  of  Philippi,  unlike  those  in  Antioch 
(11:26),  did  not  recognize  any  distinction  between  Jews  and 
Christians.  These  four  men  were  Jews.  This  appeal  to  race 
prejudice  would  be  especially  pertinent  then  because  of  the 
recent  decree  of  Claudius  expelling  Jews  from  Rome  (18:2). 
It  was  about  a.d.  49  or  50  that  Paul  is  in  Philippi.  The  hatred 
of  the  Jews  by  the  Romans  is  known  otherwise  (Cicero, 
Pro  Flacco,  XXVIII;  Juvenal,  XIV.  96-106).  Do  exceedingly 
trouble  (ektarassousin).  Late  compound  (eflFective  use  of  ek  in

21.  Customs  which  it  is  not  lawful  for  us  to  receive^  or  to 
observe^  being  Romans  {ethe  ha  ouk  estin  hemin  paradechesthai 
oude  poiein  Romaiois  ousin).  Note  the  sharp  contrast 
between  "being  Jews"  in  verse  20  and  "being  Romans" 
here.  This  pose  of  patriotism  is  all  sound  and  fury.  It  is 
love  of  money  that  moves  these  "masters"  far  more  than 
zeal  for  Rome.  As  Roman  citizens  in  a  colony  they  make 
full  use  of  all  their  rights  of  protest.  Judaism  was  a  religio 
licita  in  the  Roman  empire,  only  they  were  not  allowed  to 
make  proselytes  of  the  Romans  themselves.  No  Roman 
magistrate  would  pass  on  abstract  theological  questions 
(18:15),  but  only  if  a  breach  of  the  peace  was  made  (ektaras- 
sousin  himon  ten  polin)  or  the  formation  of  secret  sects  and 
organizations.  Evidently  both  of  these  last  points  are  in- 
volved by  the  charges  of  "unlawful  customs"  by  the  masters 
who  are  silent  about  their  real  ground  of  grievance  against 
Paul  and  Silas.  Ethos  (kin  to  ethosy  I  Cor.  15:33)  is  from 
ethoj  to  be  accustomed  or  used  to  a  thing.  The  Romans 
granted  toleration  to  conquered  nations  to  follow  their  reli- 
gious customs  provided  they  did  not  try  to  win  the  Romans. 
But  the  Jews  had  made  great  headway  to  favour  (the  God- 
fearers)  with  increasing  hatred  also.  Emperor  worship  had 
in  store  grave  peril  for  both  Jews  and  Christians.  The 
Romans  will  care  more  for  this  than  for  the  old  gods  and 
goddesses.   It  will  combine  patriotism  and  piety. 

22.  Rose  up  together  (sunepeste).  Second  aorist  (ingressive) 
active  of  the  double  compound  sunephistemi,  intransitive, 
old  verb,  but  only  here  in  the  N.T.  (cf.  katepestesan  in  18:12). 
There  was  no  actual  attack  of  the  mob  as  Paul  and  Silas 
were  in  the  hands  of  the  officers,  but  a  sudden  and  violent 
uprising  of  the  people,  the  appeal  to  race  and  national  prej- 
udice having  raised  a  ferment.  Rent  their  garments  off  them 
{perirexantes  auton  ta  himatia).  First  aorist  active  participle 
of  periregnumiy  old  verb,  to  break  off  all  around,  to  strip  or 
rend  all  round.   Here  only  in  the  N.T.   The  duumvirs  prob- 


258      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

ably  gave  orders  for  Paul  and  Silas  to  be  stripped  of  their 
outer  garments  (himatia),  though  not  actually  doing  it  with 
their  own  hands,  least  of  all  not  stripping  off  their  own  gar- 
ments in  horror  as  Ramsay  thinks.  That  would  call  for  the 
middle  voice.  In  II  Mace.  4:38  the  active  voice  is  used  as 
here  of  stripping  off  the  garments  of  others.  Paul  in  I  Thess. 
2:2  refers  to  the  shameful  treatment  received  in  Philippi, 
"insulted"  (kubristhentas).  As  a  Roman  citizen  this  was  un- 
lawful, but  the  duumvirs  looked  on  Paul  and  Silas  as  vaga- 
bond and  seditious  Jews  and  "acted  with  the  highhandedness 
characteristic  of  the  fussy  provincial  authorities"  (Know- 
ling).  Commanded  {ekeleuon).  Imperfect  active,  repeatedly 
ordered.  The  usual  formula  of  command  was:  "Go,  lictors; 
strip  off  their  garments;  let  them  be  scourged."  To  beat  them 
with  rods  (rhabdizein).  Present  active  infinitive  of  rhabdizOj 
old  verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  =virgis  caedere  only  here  and  II 
Cor.  11:25  where  Paul  alludes  to  this  incident  and  two 
others  not  given  by  Luke  {tris  erhabdisthen) .  He  came  near 
getting  another  in  Jerusalem  (Acts  22:25).  Why  did  not 
Paul  say  here  that  he  was  a  Roman  citizen  as  he  does  later 
(verse  37)  and  in  Jerusalem  (22:26f.).'*  It  might  have  done 
no  good  in  this  hubbub  and  no  opportunity  was  allowed  for 
defence  of  any  kind. 

23.  When  they  had  laid  (epithentes) .  Second  aorist  (consta- 
tive)  active  participle  of  epitithemi,  to  place  upon.  Many 
stripes  {pollas  plegas).  The  Jewish  law  was  forty  stripes  save 
one  (II  Cor.  11:24).  The  Roman  custom  depended  on  the 
caprice  of  the  judge  and  was  a  terrible  ordeal.  It  was  the 
custom  to  inflict  the  stripes  on  the  naked  body  (back)  as 
Livy  2.5  says:  '* Missique  lictores  ad  sumendum  supplicium, 
nudatos  virgis  caedunt.^''  On  plegas  (from  plcsso,  to  strike  a 
blow)  see  on  Luke  10:30;  I2:47f.  The  jailor  (toi  desmophu- 
laki).  Late  word  {desmos,  phulax,  keeper  of  bonds),  in  the 
N.T.  only  here  (verses  23,  27,  36).  The  LXX  has  the  word 
archidesmophulax   (Gen.   39:21-23).    Chrysostom   calls   this

jailor  Stephanus,  he  was  of  Achaia  (I  Cor.  16:15).  T^  ^^^P 
safely  (asphalos  terein).  Present  active  infinitive,  to  keep  on 
keeping  safely,  perhaps  "as  dangerous  political  prisoners" 
(Rackham).  He  had  some  rank  and  was  not  a  mere  turnkey. 

24.  Into  the  inner  prison  (eis  ten  esoteran  phulaken).  The 
comparative  form  from  the  adverb  eso  (within),  Ionic  and 
old  Attic  for  eisb.  In  the  LXX,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here 
and  Heb.  6:19.  The  Roman  public  prisons  had  a  vestibule 
and  outer  prison  and  behind  this  the  inner  prison,  a  veritable 
dungeon  with  no  light  or  air  save  what  came  through  the 
door  when  open.  One  has  only  to  picture  modern  cells  in 
our  jails,  the  dungeons  in  feudal  castles,  London  prisons 
oefore  the  time  of  Howard,  to  appreciate  the  horrors  of  an 
inner  prison  cell  in  a  Roman  provincial  town  of  the  first 
century  a.d.  Made  their  feet  fast  (tous  podas  esphalisato 
auton).  First  aorist  (effective)  middle  of  asphalizo,  from 
asphales  (safe),  common  verb  in  late  Greek,  in  the  N.T. 
only  here  and  Matt.  24:64!?.  The  inner  prison  was  safe 
enough  without  this  refinement  of  cruelty.  In  the  stocks 
{eis  to  xulon).  Xulon,  from  xuo,  to  scrape  or  plane,  is  used  for 
a  piece  of  wood  whether  a  cross  or  gibbet  (Acts  5:30;  10:39; 
13:29;  Gal.  3:13;  I  Peter  2:24)  or  a  log  or  timber  with  five 
holes  (four  for  the  wrists  and  ankles  and  one  for  the  neck)  or 
two  for  the  feet  as  here,  xulopede,  Latin  vervus,  to  shackle 
the  feet  stretched  apart  (Job  33:11).  This  torment  was 
practiced  in  Sparta,  Athens,  Rome,  and  Adonirom  Judson 
suffered  it  in  Burmah.  Xulon  is  also  used  in  the  N.T.  for 
stick  or  staff  (Matt.  26:47)  and  even  a  tree  (Luke  23:31). 
Tertullian  said  of  Christians  in  the  stocks:  Nihil  cms  sentit 
in  vervo,  quum  animus  in  caelo  est  (Nothing  the  limb  feels 
in  the  stocks  when  the  mind  is  in  heaven). 

25.  About  midnight  (kata  de  mesqnuktion).  Middle  of  the 
night,  old  adjective  seen  already  in  Mark  13:35;  Luke  11:5 
which  see.  Were  praying  and  singing  (proseuchomenoi  hum- 
noun).    Present  middle  participle  and  imperfect  active  indie- 


26o      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

ative:  Praying  they  were  singing  (simultaneously,  blending 
together  petition  and  praise).  Humneo  is  an  old  verb  from 
humnos  (cf.  Isa.  12:4;  Dan.  3:23).  Paul  and  Silas  probably 
used  portions  of  the  Psalms  (cf.  Luke  i  :39f.,  67f.;  2:28f.) 
with  occasional  original  outbursts  of  praise.  Were  listening 
to  them  {epekroonto  auton).  Imperfect  middle  of  epakroaomai. 
Rare  verb  to  listen  with  pleasure  as  to  a  recitation  or  music 
(Page).  It  was  a  new  experience  for  the  prisoners  and  won- 
drously  attractive  entertainment  to  them. 

26.  Earthquake  (seismos).  Old  word  from  seio,  to  shake. 
Luke  regarded  it  as  an  answer  to  prayer  as  in  4:31.  He  and 
Timothy  were  not  in  prison.  So  that  the  foundations  of  the 
prison  house  were  shaken  {hoste  saleuthenai  ta  themelia  tou 
desmbteriou).  Regular  construction  of  the  first  aorist  pas- 
sive infinitive  and  the  accusative  of  general  reference  with 
hoste  for  actual  result  just  like  the  indicative.  This  old 
word  for  prison  house  already  in  Matt.  11:2;  Acts  5:21,  23 
which  see.  Themelia  is  neuter  plural  of  the  adjective  the- 
melios,  from  thema  (thing  laid  down  from  tithemi).  So  al- 
ready in  Luke  6:48;  14:29.  If  the  prison  was  excavated  from 
rocks  in  the  hillside,  as  was  often  the  case,  the  earthquake 
would  easily  have  slipped  the  bars  of  the  doors  loose  and  the 
chains  would  have  fallen  out  of  the  walls.  Were  opened 
{eneoichthesan).  First  aorist  passive  indicative  of  anoigb 
(or  -numi)  with  triple  augment  (^,  <?,  0),  while  there  is  no 
augment  in  anethe  (first  aorist  passive  indicative  of  aniemi, 
were  loosed),  old  verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  27:40; 
Eph.  6:9;  Heb.  13:5. 

27.  Being  roused  out  of  sleep  {exupnos  genomenos).  Becom- 
ing exupnos  (rare  word,  only  here  in  N.T.,  in  LXX  and 
Josephus).  An  earthquake  like  that  would  wake  up  any  one. 
Open  {anebigmenos).  Perfect  passive  participle  with  double 
reduplication  in  predicate  position,  standing  open.  Drew 
his  sword  {spasamenos  ten  machairan).  First  aorist  middle 
participle  of  spab,  to  draw,  as  in  Mark  14:47,  drawing  his 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  26 1 

own  sword  himself.  Our  word  spasm  from  this  old  word. 
Was  about  {emellen).  Imperfect  active  of  mello  with  both 
syllabic  and  temporal  augment  and  followed  here  by  pres- 
ent infinitive.  He  was  on  the  point  of  committing  suicide 
as  Brutus  had  done  near  here.  Stoicism  had  made  suicide 
popular  as  the  escape  from  trouble  like  the  Japanese  hari- 
kari.  Had  escaped  (ekpepheugenai).  Second  perfect  active 
infinitive  of  ekpheugo,  old  verb  with  perfective  force  of  ek^ 
to  flee  out,  to  get  clean  away.  This  infinitive  and  accusative 
of  general  reference  is  due  to  indirect  discourse  after  nomi- 
zon.  Probably  the  prisoners  were  so  panic  stricken  by  the 
earthquake  that  they  did  not  rally  to  the  possibility  of 
escape  before  the  jailor  awoke.  He  was  responsible  for  the 
prisoners  with  his  life  (12:19;  27:42). 

28.  Do  thyself  no  harm  {meden  praxeis  seautoi  kakon). 
The  usual  construction  {me  and  the  aorist  subjunctive)  for  a 
prohibition  not  to  begin  to  do  a  thing.  The  older  Greek  would 
probably  have  used  poieseis  here.  The  later  Greek  does  not 
always  preserve  the  old  distinction  between  poied,  to  do  a 
thing,  and  prasso,  to  practice,  though  prassete  keeps  it  in 
Phil.  4:9  and  poied  is  rightly  used  in  Luke  3:10-14.  As  a 
matter  of  fact  prasso  does  not  occur  in  Matthew  or  in 
Mark,  only  twice  in  John,  six  times  in  Luke's  Gospel,  thir- 
teen in  Acts,  and  elsewhere  by  Paul.  Sprang  in  (eisepedesen). 
First  aorist  active  of  eispedad,  old  verb,  but  here  only  in  the 
N.T.  Cf.  ekpedao  in  14:14.  The  jailor  was  at  the  outer  door 
and  he  wanted  lights  to  see  what  was  inside  in  the  inner 
prison. 

29.  Trembling  for  fear  {entromos  genomenos).  "Becoming 
terrified."  The  adjective  entromos  (in  terror)  occurs  in  N.T. 
only  here  and  7:32  and  Heb.  12:21.  Fell  down  (prosepesen). 
Second  aorist  active  indicative  of  prospiptOy  old  verb.  An  act 
of  worship  as  Cornelius  before  Peter  (10:25),  when  prose- 
kunesen  is  used. 

30.  Brought   them    out    {progagon    autous   exb).       Second 


262      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAiMENT 

aorist  active  participle  of  proago,  to  lead  forward.  He  left 
the  other  prisoners  inside,  feeling  that  he  had  to  deal  with 
these  men  whom  he  had  evidently  heard  preach  or  had 
heard  of  their  message  as  servants  of  the  Most  High  God 
as  the  slave  girl  called  them.  There  may  have  been  super- 
stition behind  his  fear,  but  there  was  evident  sincerity. 

31.  To  be  saved  {hina  sotho).  Final  clause  with  hina  and 
first  aorist  passive  subjunctive.  What  did  he  mean  by 
" saved ".^  Certainly  more  than  escape  from  peril  about 
the  prisoners  or  because  of  the  earthquake,  though  these 
had  their  influences  on  him.  Cf.  way  of  salvation  In  verse  17. 
Believe  on  the  Lord  Jesus  {Pisteuson  epi  ton  kurion  lesoun). 
This  is  what  Peter  told  Cornelius  (10:43).  This  is  the  heart 
of  the  matter  for  both  the  jailor  and  his  house. 

32.  They  spake  the  word  of  God  {elalesan  ton  logon  tou 
theou).  So  Paul  and  Silas  gave  fuller  exposition  of  the  way 
of  life  to  the  jailor  "with  all  that  were  in  his  house."  It  was 
a  remarkable  service  with  keenest  attention  and  interest, 
the  jailor  with  his  warden,  slaves,  and  family. 

33.  Washed  their  stripes  {elousen  apo  ton  plegbn).  Deiss- 
mann  {Bible  Studies^  p.  227)  cites  an  inscription  of  Perga- 
mum  with  this  very  construction  of  apo  and  the  ablative, 
to  wash  off,  though  it  is  an  old  verb.  This  first  aorist  active 
indicative  of  louo,  to  bathe,  succinctly  shows  what  the 
jailor  did  to  remove  the  stains  left  by  the  rods  of  the  lictors 
(verse  22).  Nipto  was  used  for  washing  parts  of  the  body. 
And  was  baptized^  he  and  all  his,  immediately  {kai  ebaptisthe 
autos  kai  hoi  autou  hapantes  parachrema).  The  verb  is  in  the 
singular  agreeing  with  autos,  but  it  is  to  be  supplied  with 
hoi  autou,  and  it  was  done  at  once. 

34.  He  brought  them  up  (anagagon) .  Second  aorist  active 
participle  of  anagb.  It  looks  as  if  his  house  was  above  the 
prison.  The  baptism  apparently  took  place  in  the  pool  or 
tank  in  which  he  bathed  Paul  and  Silas  (Dc  Wette)  or  the 
rectangular  basin  iimpluvium)  in  the  court  for  receiving  the 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  263 

rain  or  even  in  a  swimming  pool  or  bath  {kolumheihra) 
found  within  the  walls  of  the  prison  (Kuinoel).  Meyer: 
"Perhaps  the  water  was  in  the  court  of  the  house;  and  the 
baptism  was  that  of  immersion,  which  formed  an  essential 
part  of  the  symbolism  of  the  act."  Set  meat  {paretheken 
trapezan).  Set  a  " table "  before  them  with  food  on  it.  They 
had  probably  had  no  food  for  a  day.  fVith  all  his  house 
{panoikex).  Adverb,  once  in  Plato,  though  usually  panoik- 
idi.  In  LXX,  but  here  alone  in  the  N.T.  It  is  in  an  am- 
phibolous position  and  can  be  taken  either  with  "rejoiced" 
(egalliasato)  or  "having  believed"  (pepisteukos,  perfect 
active  participle,  permanent  belief),  coming  between  them. 
The  whole  household  (family,  warden,  slaves)  heard  the 
word  of  God,  believed  in  the  Lord  Jesus,  made  confession, 
were  baptized,  and  rejoiced.  Furneaux  considers  the  haste 
in  baptism  here  "precipitate"  as  in  the  baptism  of  the 
eunuch.   But  why  delay  .'* 

35.  The  Serjeants  {tous  rhahdouchous) .  Fasces-bearers, 
regular  Greek  word  {rhabdos,  echo)  for  Latin  lictores  though 
Cicero  says  that  they  should  carry  baculi,  not  fasces.  Was 
this  message  because  of  the  earthquake,  the  influence  of 
Lydia,  or  a  belated  sense  of  justice  on  the  part  of  the  magis- 
trates (praetors).?  Perhaps  a  bit  of  all  three  may  be  true. 
The  Codex  Bezae  expressly  says  that  the  magistrates 
"assembled  together  in  the  market  place  and  recollecting 
the  earthquake  that  had  happened  they  were  afraid." 

36.  Now  therefore  {nun.oun).  Note  both  particles  (time 
and  inference).  It  was  a  simple  matter  to  the  jailor  and  he 
was  full  of  glee  over  this  happy  outcome. 

37.  Unto  them  {pros  autous).  The  lictors  by  the  jailor. 
The  reply  of  Paul  is  a  marvel  of  brevity  and  energy,  almost 
every  word  has  a  separate  indictment  showing  the  utter 
illegality  of  the  whole  proceeding.  They  have  beaten  us 
{deirantes  hemas).  First  aorist  active  participle  of  dero,  old 
verb  to  flay,  to  skin,  to  smite.    The  Lex  Valeria  b.c.  509 


264      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

and  the  Lex  Poscia  B.C.  248  made  it  a  crime  to  inflict  blows 
on  a  Roman  citizen.  Cicero  says,  "To  fetter  a  Roman  citizen 
was  a  crime,  to  scourge  him  a  scandal,  to  slay  him — parri- 
cide." Claudius  had  "deprived  the  city  of  Rhodes  of  its 
freedom  for  having  crucified  some  citizen  of  Rome"  (Rack- 
ham).  Publicly  {demosidi).  This  added  insult  to  injury. 
Common  adverb (Ao^o/)  supplied  with  adjective,  associative 
instrumental  case,  opposed  to  ididi  or  kaf  oikous,  Acts  20:20) 
Uncondemned  {akatakritous) .  This  same  verbal  adjective 
from  kata-krino  with  a  privative  is  used  by  Paul  in  22:25  and 
nowhere  else  in  the  N.T.  Rare  in  late  Greek  like  akatagnostoSy 
but  in  late  Koine  (papyri,  inscriptions).  The  meaning  is 
clearly  "without  being  tried."  Paul  and  Silas  were  not 
given  a  chance  to  make  a  defence.  They  were  sentenced 
unheard  (25:16).  Even  slaves  in  Roman  law  had  a  right  to 
be  heard.  Men  that  are  Romans  {anthropous  Romaious 
kuparchontas).  The  praetors  did  not  know,  of  course,  that 
Paul  and  Silas  were  Roman  citizens  any  more  than  Lysias 
knew  it  in  Acts  22:27.  Paul's  claim  is  not  challenged  in 
either  instance.  It  was  a  capital  offence  to  make  a  false 
claim  to  Roman  citizenship.  Have  cast  us  into  prison  {ehalan 
eis  phulaken).  Second  aorist  active  indicative  of  hallo,  old 
verb,  with  first  aorist  ending  as  often  in  the  Koine  {-an,  not 
-on).  This  was  the  climax,  treating  them  as  criminals.  And 
now  privily  {kai  nun  lathrdi).  Paul  balances  their  recent 
conduct  with  the  former.  Nay  verily,  but  {ou  gar,  alia).  No 
indeed!  It  is  the  use  of  gar  so  common  in  answers  (ge+ara) 
as  in  Matt.  27:23.  Jlla  gives  the  sharp  alternative.  Them- 
selves (autoi).  As  a  public  acknowledgment  that  they  had 
wronged  and  mistreated  Paul  and  Silas.  Let  them  come 
themselves  and  lead  us  out  {exagagetosan,  third  person  plural 
second  aorist  active  imperative  of  exago).  It  was  a  bitter 
pill  to  the  proud  praetors. 

39.   They  feared  (ephobethesan) .    This  is  the  explanation. 
They  became  frightened  for  their  own  lives  when  they  saw 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  265 

what  they  had  done  to  Roman  citizens.  They  asked  {erdtbn). 
Imperfect  active  of  erbtao.  They  kept  on  begging  them  to 
leave  for  fear  of  further  trouble.  The  colonists  in  Philippi 
would  turn  against  the  praetors  if  they  learned  the  facts, 
proud  as  they  were  of  being  citizens.  This  verb  in  the  Koine 
is  often  used  as  here  to  make  a  request  and  not  just  to  ask 
a  question. 

40.  Into  the  house  of  Lydia  {pros  ten  Ludi'an).  No  word  in 
the  Greek  for  "house,"  but  it  means  the  house  of  Lydia. 
Note  "the  brethren"  here,  not  merely  Luke  and  Timothy, 
but  other  brethren  now  converted  besides  those  in  the  house 
of  the  jailor.  The  four  missionaries  were  guests  of  Lydia 
(verse  15)  and  probably  the  church  now  met  in  her  home. 
They  departed  (exelthan).  Paul  and  Silas,  but  not  Luke  and 
Timothy.  Note  "they"  here,  not  "we."  Note  also  the  -an 
ending  instead  of  -on  as  above.  The  movements  of  Timothy 
are  not  perfectly  clear  till  he  reappears  at  Beroea  (17:15). 
It  seems  unlikely  that  he  came  to  Thessalonica  with  Paul 
and  Silas  since  only  Paul  and  Silas  obtained  security  there 
(17:9)  and  were  sent  on  to  Beroea  (17:10).  Probably  Tim- 
othy was  sent  to  Thessalonica  from  Philippi  with  gifts  of 
which  Paul  spoke  later  (Phil.  4:1 5f.).  Then  he  followed  Paul 
and  Silas  to  Beroea. 


CHAPTER  XVII 

I.  When  they  had  passed  through  {diodeus antes).  First 
aorist  active  participle  of  diodeub,  common  verb  in  the 
Koinl  (Polybius,  Plutarch,  LXX,  etc.),  but  in  the  N.T.  only 
here  and  Luke  8:i.  It  means  literally  to  make  one's  way 
(hodos)  through  (dia).  They  took  the  Egnatian  Way,  one 
of  the  great  Roman  roads  from  Byzantium  to  Dyrrachium 
(over  500  miles  long)  on  the  Adriatic  Sea,  opposite  Brundi- 
sium  and  so  an  extension  of  the  Appian  Way.  Amphipolis 
{ten  Amphipolin).  So  called  because  the  Strymon  flowed 
almost  around  {amphi)  it,  the  metropolis  of  Macedonia 
Prima,  a  free  city,  about  32  miles  from  Philippi,  about 
three  miles  from  the  sea.  Paul  and  Silas  may  have  spent 
only  a  night  here  or  longer.  Apollonia  {ten  Apollonian). 
Not  the  famous  Apollonia  in  Illyria,  but  32  miles  from 
Amphipolis  on  the  Egnatian  Way.  So  here  again  a  night 
was  spent  if  no  more.  Why  Paul  hurried  through  these  two 
large  cities,  if  he  did,  we  do  not  know.  There  are  many  gaps 
in  Luke's  narrative  that  we  have  no  way  of  filling  up.  There 
may  have  been  no  synagogues  for  one  thing.  To  Thessor 
lonica  {eis  Thessaloniken).  There  was  a  synagogue  here  in 
this  great  commercial  city,  still  an  important  city  called 
Saloniki,  of  70,000  population.  It  was  originally  called 
Therma,  at  the  head  of  the  Thermaic  Gulf.  Cassander  re- 
named it  Thessalonica  after  his  wife,  the  sister  of  Alexander 
the  Great.  It  was  the  capital  of  the  second  of  the  four  divi- 
sions of  Macedonia  and  finally  the  capital  of  the  whole 
province.  It  shared  with  Corinth  and  Ephesus  the  commerce 
of  the  Aegean.  One  synagogue  shows  that  even  in  this  com- 
mercial city  the  Jews  were  not  very  numerous.  As  a  political 
centre  it  ranked  with  Antioch  in  Syria  and  Caesarea  in  Pales- 

266 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  267 

tine.  It  was  a  strategic  centre  for  the  spread  of  the  gospel 
as  Paul  later  said  for  it  sounded  (echoed)  forth  from  Thes- 
salonica  throughout  Macedonia  and  Achaia  (I  Thess.  i  :8). 

2.  As  his  custom  was  {kata  to  eidthos  toi  Paulbi).  The  same 
construction  in  Luke  4:16  about  Jesus  in  Nazareth  {kata  to 
eidthos  autbi)  with  the  second  perfect  active  participle  neuter 
singular  from  etho.  Paul's  habit  was  to  go  to  the  Jewish 
synagogue  to  use  the  Jews  and  the  God-fearers  as  a  spring- 
board for  his  work  among  the  Gentiles.  For  three  Sabbaths 
{epi  sabbata  tria).  Probably  the  reference  is  to  the  first  three 
Sabbaths  when  Paul  had  a  free  hand  in  the  synagogue  as  at 
first  in  Antioch  in  Pisidia.  Luke  does  not  say  that  Paul  was 
in  Thessalonica  only  three  weeks.  He  may  have  spoken  there 
also  during  the  week,  though  the  Sabbath  was  the  great 
day.  Paul  makes  it  plain,  as  Furnfeaux  shows,  that  he  was 
in  Thessalonica  a  much  longer  period  than  three  weeks. 
The  rest  of  the  time  he  spoke,  of  course,  outside  of  the  syna- 
gogue.    Paul  implies  an  extended  stay  by  his  language  in 

I  Thess.  1 :8.  The  church  consisted  mainly  of  Gentile  con- 
verts (II  Thess.  3:4,  7,  8)  and  seems  to  have  been  well 
organized  (I  Thess.  5:12).  He  received  help  while  there 
several  times  from  Philippi  (Phil.  4:16)  and  even  so  worked 
night  and  day  to  support  himself  (I  Thess.  2:9).  His  preach- 
ing was  misunderstood  there  in  spite  of  careful  instruction 
ccMicerning  the  second  coming  of  Christ  (I  Thess.  4:13-5:5; 

II  Thess.  2:1-12).  Reasoned  (dielexato).  First  aorist  middle 
indicative  of  dialegomai,  old  verb  in  the  active  to  select, 
distinguish,  then  to  revolve  in  the  mind,  to  converse  (inter- 
change of  ideas),  then  to  teach  in  the  Socratic  ("dialectic") 
method  of  question  and  answer  (of.  dielegeto  in  verse  17), 
then  simply  to  discourse,  but  always  with  the  idea  of  intel- 
lectual stimulus.  With  these  Jews  and  God-fearers  Paul  ap- 
pealed to  the  Scriptures  as  text  and  basis  {apo)  of  his  ideas. 

3.  Opening  and  alleging  {dianoigbn  kai  paratithemenos). 
Opening  the  Scriptures,  Luke  means,  as  made  plain  by  the 


268      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

mission  and  message  of  Jesus,  the  same  word  {dianoigo) 
used  by  him  of  the  interpretation  of  the  Scriptures  by  Jesus 
(Luke  24:32)  and  of  the  opening  of  the  mind  of  the  disciples 
also  by  Jesus  (Luke  24:45)  and  of  the  opening  of  Lydia's 
heart  by  the  Lord  (16:14).  One  cannot  refrain  from  saying 
that  such  exposition  of  the  Scriptures  as  Jesus  and  Paul 
gave  would  lead  to  more  opening  of  mind  and  heart.  Paul 
was  not  only  ''expounding"  the  Scriptures,  he  was  also  "pro- 
pounding" (the  old  meaning  of  "allege")  his  doctrine  or 
setting  forth  alongside  the  Scriptures  {para-tithemenos), 
quoting  the  Scripture  to  prove  his  contention  which  was 
made  in  much  conflict  (I  Thess.  2:2),  probably  in  the  midst 
of  heated  discussion  by  the  opposing  rabbis  who  were  any- 
thing but  convinced  by  Paul's  powerful  arguments,  for  the 
Cross  was  a  stumbling-block  to  the  Jews  (I  Cor.  i  :23).  That 
it  behoved  the  Christ  to  suffer  (hoti  ton  Christon  edei  pathein). 
The  second  aorist  active  infinitive  is  the  subject  of  edei  with 
ton  Christon,  the  accusative  of  general  reference.  This  is 
Paul's  major  premise  in  his  argument  from  the  Scriptures 
about  the  Messiah,  the  necessity  of  his  sufferings  according 
to  the  Scriptures,  the  very  argument  made  by  the  Risen 
Jesus  to  the  two  on  the  way  to  Emmaus  (Luke  24:25-27). 
The  fifty-third  chapter  of  Isaiah  was  a  passage  in  point  that 
the  rabbis  had  overlooked.  Peter  made  the  same  point  in 
Acts  3:18  and  Paul  again  in  Acts  26:23.  The  minor  premise 
is  the  resurrection  of  Jesus  from  the  dead.  To  rise  again  from 
the  dead  {anastenai  ek  nekron).  This  second  aorist  active  in- 
finitive anastenai  is  also  the  subject  of  edei.  The  actual 
resurrection  of  Jesus  was  also  a  necessity  as  Paul  says  he 
preached  to  them  (I  Thess.  4:14)  and  argued  always  from 
Scripture  (I  Cor.  15:3-4)  and  from  his  own  experience  (Acts 
9:22;  22:7;  26:8,  14;  I  Cor.  15:8).  This  Jesus  is  the  Christ 
{houtos  estin  ho  Christos,  ho  lesous).  More  precisely,  "This 
is  the  Messiah,  viz.,  Jesus  whom  I  am  proclaiming  unto  you." 
This  is  the  conclusion  of  Paul's  line  of  argument  and  it  is 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  269 

logical  and  overwhelming.  It  is  his  method  everywhere  as  in 
Damascus,  in  Antioch  in  Pisidia,  here,  in  Corinth.  He  spoke 
as  an  eye-witness. 

4.  Some  of  them  {tines  ex  auton).  That  is  of  the  Jews  who 
were  evidently  largely  afraid  of  the  rabbis.  Still  "some" 
were  persuaded  {epeisthesan^  effective  first  aorist  passive 
indicative)  and  "consorted  with"  {proseklerbthesan).  This 
latter  verb  is  also  first  aorist  passive  indicative  of  proskleroo, 
a  common  verb  in  late  Greek  (Plutarch,  Lucian),  but  only 
here  in  the  N.T.,  from  pros  and  kleros,  to  assign  by  lot.  So 
then  this  small  group  of  Jews  were  given  Paul  and  Silas  by 
God's  grace.  And  of  the  devout  Greeks  a  great  multitude  {ton  te 
sehomenon  Hellenon  plethos  polu).  These  "God-fearers" 
among  the  Gentiles  were  less  under  the  control  of  the  jealous 
rabbis  and  so  responded  more  readily  to  Paul's  appeal. 
In  I  Thess.  1:9  Paul  expressly  says  that  they  had  "turned 
to  God  from  idols,"  proof  that  this  church  was  mainly 
Gentile  (cf.  also  I  Thess.  2:14).  And  of  the  chief  women  not  a 
few  {gunaikon  te  ton  proton  ouk  oligai).  Literally,  "And  of 
women  the  first  not  a  few."  That  is,  a  large  number  of 
women  of  the  very  first  rank  in  the  city,  probably  devout 
women  also  like  the  men  just  before  and  like  those  in  13:50 
in  Antioch  in  Pisidia  who  along  with  "the  first  men  of  the 
city"  were  stirred  up  against  Paul.  Here  these  women  were 
openly  friendly  to  Paul's  message,  whether  proselytes  or 
Gentiles  or  Jewish  wives  of  Gentiles  as  Hort  holds.  It  is 
noteworthy  that  here,  as  In  PhlllppI,  leading  women  take 
a  bold  stand  for  Christ.  In  Macedonia  women  had  more 
freedom  than  elsewhere.  It  is  not  to  be  Inferred  that  all  those 
converted  belonged  to  the  higher  classes,  for  the  industrial 
element  was  clearly  large  (I  Thess.  4:11).  In  II  Cor.  8:2 
Paul  speaks  of  the  deep  poverty  of  the  Macedonian  churches, 
but  with  Phillppi  mainly  In  mind.  Ramsay  thinks  that  Paul 
won  many  of  the  heathen  not  affiliated  at  all  with  the  syna- 
gogue.     Certain  it  is   that  we   must   allow  a  considerable 


270      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

interval  of  time  between  verses  4  and  5  to  understand  what 
Paul  says  in  his  Thessalonian  Epistles. 

5.  Moved  with  jealousy  {zelos antes).  Both  our  English 
words,  zeal  3ind  jealousy.,  are  from  the  Greek  z^/oj.  In  13:45 
the  Jews  (rabbis)  "were  filled  with  jealousy"  {eplesthesan 
zelou).  That  is  another  way  of  saying  the  same  thing  as 
here.  The  success  of  Paul  was  entirely  too  great  in  both 
places  to  please  the  rabbis.  So  here  is  jealousy  of  Jewish 
preachers  towards  Christian  preachers.  It  is  always  between 
men  or  women  of  the  same  profession  or  group.  In  I  Thess. 
2:3-10  Paul  hints  at  some  of  the  slanders  spread  against 
him  by  these  rabbis  (deceivers,  using  words  of  flattery  as 
men-pleasers,  after  vain-glory,  greed  of  gain,  etc.).  Took 
unto  them  (proslabomenoi).  Second  aorist  middle  (indirect, 
to  themselves)  participle  of  proslambano,  old  and  common 
verb.  Certain  vile  fellows  of  the  rabble  {ton  agoraion  andras 
tinas  ponerous).  The  agora  or  market-place  was  the  natural 
resort  for  those  with  nothing  to  do  (Matt.  20:4)  like  the 
court-house  square  today  or  various  parks  in  our  cities  where 
bench-warmers  flock.  Plato  {Protagoras  347  C)  calls  these 
agoraioi  (common  word,  but  in  N.T.  only  here  and  19:38) 
idlers  or  good-for-nothing  fellows.  They  are  in  every  city 
and  such  "bums"  are  ready  for  any  job.  The  church  in 
Thessalonica  caught  some  of  these  peripatetic  idlers  (II 
Thess.  3:iof.)  "doing  nothing  but  doing  about."  So  the 
Jewish  preachers  gather  to  themselves  a  choice  collection  of 
these  market-loungers  or  loafers  or  wharf-rats.  The  Romans 
called  them  subrostrani  (hangers  round  the  rostrum  or  sub- 
basilicari).  Gathering  a  crowd  {ochlopoiesantes).  Literally, 
making  or  getting  {poieo)  a  crowd  {ochlos),  a  word  not  found 
elsewhere.  Probably  right  in  the  agora  itself  where  the  rabbis 
could  tell  men  their  duties  and  pay  them  in  advance.  In-

thorubos  (tumult),  old  verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and 
20:10;  Matt.  9:23;  Mark  4:39.  They  kept  up  the  din,  this 
combination  of  rabbis  and  rabble.  Assaulting  the  house  of

because  he  was  Paul's  host.  He  may  have  been  a  Gentile 
(Jason  the  name  of  an  ancient  king  of  Thessaly),  but  the 
Jews  often  used  it  for  Joshua  or  Jesus  (H  Mace,  i  7).  They

6.  When  they  found  them  not  {me  heurontes).  Usual  nega- 
tive me  with  the  participle  in  the  Koine,  second  aorist  (effec- 
tive) active  participle,  complete  failure  with  all  the  noise

vivid  picture,  they  were  dragging  (literally).  See  already 
8:3;  16:19.  If  they  could  not  find  Paul,  they  could  drag 
Jason  his  host  and  some  other  Christians  whom  we  do  not 
know.  Before  the  rulers  of  the  city  {epi  tous  politarchas).  This 
word  does  not  occur  in  Greek  literature  and  used  to  be  cited 
as  an  example  of  Luke's  blunders.  But  now  it  is  found  in  an 
inscription  on  an  arch  in  the  modern  city  preserved  in  the 
British  Museum.  It  is  also  found  in  seventeen  inscriptions 
(five  from  Thessalonica)  where  the  word  or  the  verb  politar- 
ched  occurs.  It  is  a  fine  illustration  of  the  historical  accuracy 
of  Luke  in  matters  of  detail.  This  title  for  city  officers  in 
Thessalonica,  a  free  city,  is  correct.  They  were  burgomasters 
or  "rulers  of  the  city."  Crying  {hoontes).  Yelling  as  if  the

a  natural  hyperbole  in  their  excitement,  but  the  phrase  occurs 
for  the  Roman  Empire  in  Luke  2:1.   It  is  possible  that  news

had  come  to  Thessalonica  of  the  expulsion  of  the  Jews  from 
Rome  by  Claudius.  There  is  truth  in  the  accusation,  for 
Christianity  is  revolutionary,  but  on  this  particular  occasion 
the  uproar  (verse  5)  was  created  by  the  rabbis  and  the  hired 
loafers.  The  verb  anastatoo  (here  first  aorist  active  participle) 
does  not  occur  in  the  ancient  writers,  but  is  in  LXX  and  in 
Acts  17:6;  21:38;  Gal.  5:12.  It  occurs  also  in  Harpocration 
(a.d.  4th  cent.)  and  about  100  B.C.  exanastatoo  is  found  in  a 
fragment  of  papyrus  (Tebtunis  no.  2)  and  in  a  Paris  Magical 
Papyrus  1.  2243f.  But  in  an  Egyptian  letter  of  Aug.  4,  41 
A.D.  (Oxyrhynchus  Pap.  no.  119,  10)  "the  bad  boy"  uses 
it  =  "he  upsets  me"  or  "  he  drives  me  out  of  my  senses" 
{anastatoi  me).  See  Deissmann,  Light  from  the  Ancient  East, 
pp.  84f.  It  is  not  a  "Biblical  word"  at  all,  but  belongs 
to  the  current  Koine.  It  is  a  vigorous  and  graphic  term. 
7.  Whom  Jason  hath  received  {hous  hupodedektai  lason). 
Present  perfect  middle  indicative  of  hupodechomai,  to  enter- 
tain, old  verb,  but  in  N.T.  only  in  Luke  10:38;  19:6;  Acts 
17-75  James  2:25.  This  is  Jason's  crime  and  he  is  the  prisoner 
before  the  politarchs.  These  all  {houtoi  pantes).  Jason,  the 
"brethren"  of  verse  6,  Paul  and  Silas,  and  all  Christians 
everywhere.  Contrary  (apenanti).  Late  compound  preposi- 
tion {apo,  en,  anti)  found  in  Polybius,  LXX,  here  only  in  the 
N.T.  The  decrees  of  Caesar  {ton  dogmatbn  Kaisaros).  This 
was  a  charge  of  treason  and  was  a  sure  way  to  get  a  convic- 
tion. Probably  the  Julian  Leges  Majestatis  are  in  mind 
rather  than  the  definite  decree  of  Claudius  about  the  Jews 
(Acts  18:2).  Saying  that  there  is  another  king,  one  Jesus 
(Basilea  heteron  legontes  einai  lesoun).  Note  the  very  order 
of  the  words  in  the  Greek  indirect  discourse  with  the  ac- 
cusative and  infinitive  after  legontes.  Basilea  heteron  comes 
first,  a  different  king,  another  emperor  than  Caesar.  This 
was  the  very  charge  that  the  smart  student  of  the  Pharisees 
and  Herodians  had  tried  to  catch  Jesus  on  (Mark  12:14). 
The   Sanhedrin   made   it   anyhow   against  Jesus   to  Pilate 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  273 

(Luke  23:2)  and  Pilate  had  to  notice  it.  "Although  the 
emperors  never  ventured  to  assume  the  title  rex  at  Rome, 
in  the  Eastern  provinces  they  were  regularly  termed  hasil- 
eus'*'*  (Page).  The  Jews  here,  as  before  Pilate  (John  19:15), 
renounce  their  dearest  hope  of  a  Messianic  king.  It  is  plain 
that  Paul  had  preached  about  Jesus  as  the  Messiah,  King 
of  the  Kingdom  of  God  over  against  the  Roman  Empire,  a 
spiritual  kingdom,  to  be  sure,  but  the  Jews  here  turn  his 
language  to  his  hurt  as  they  did  with  Jesus.  As  a  matter  of 
fact  Paul's  preaching  about  the  kingdom  and  the  second 
coming  of  Christ  was  gravely  misunderstood  by  the  Chris- 
tians at  Thessalonica  after  his  departure  (I  Thess.  4:13-5:4; 
II  Thess.  2).  The  Jews  were  quick  to  seize  upon  his  language 
about  Jesus  Christ  to  his  own  injury.  Clearly  here  in  Thes- 
salonica Paul  had  faced  the  power  of  the  Roman  Empire 
in  a  new  way  and  pictured  over  against  it  the  grandeur  of 
the  reign  of  Christ. 

8.  They  troubled  the  multitude  and  the  rulers  {etaraxan  ton 
ochlon  kai  tous  politarchas).  First  aorist  active  of  tarasso,  old 
verb  to  agitate.  The  excitement  of  the  multitude  "agitated" 
the  politarchs  still  more.  To  the  people  it  meant  a  revolu- 
tion, to  the  politarchs  a  charge  of  complicity  in  treason  if 
they  let  it  pass.  They  had  no  way  to  disprove  the  charge 
of  treason  and  Paul  and  Silas  were  not  present. 

9.  When  they  had  taken  security  {labontes  to  hikanon).  A 
Greek  idiom  =  Latin  satis  accipere,  to  receive  the  sufficient 
(bond),  usually  money  for  the  fulfilment  of  the  judgment. 
Probably  the  demand  was  made  of  Jason  that  he  see  to  it 
that  Paul  and  Silas  leave  the  city  not  to  return.  In  I  Thess. 
2:i7f.  Paul  may  refer  to  this  in  mentioning  his  inability  to 
visit  these  Thessalonians  again.  The  idiom  lambanein  to 
hikanon  now  is  found  in  two  inscriptions  of  the  second  cen- 
tury A.D.  (0.  G.  I.  S.  484,  50  and  629,  loi).  In  Vol.  Ill 
Oxyrhynchus  Papyri  no.  294  a.d.  22  the  corresponding 
phrase  dounai  heikanon  ("to  give  security")  appears.    77i^y 


274      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

let  them  go  {apelusan  autous).  The  charge  was  serious  but  the 
proof  slim  so  that  the  politarchs  were  glad  to  be  rid  of  the 
case. 

10.  Immediately  by  night  (eutheos  dia  nuktos).  Paul's  work 
had  not  been  in  vain  in  Thessalonica  (I  Thess.  i  -.ji. ;  2 : 1 3 ,  20) . 
Paul  loved  the  church  here.  Two  of  them,  Aristarchus  and 
Secundus,  will  accompany  him  to  Jerusalem  (Acts  20:4) 
and  Aristarchus  will  go  on  with  him  to  Rome  (27:2).  Plainly 
Paul  and  Silas  had  been  in  hiding  in  Thessalonica  and  in 
real  danger.  After  his  departure  severe  persecution  came  to 
the  Christians  in  Thessalonica  (I  Thess.  2:14;  3:1-5;  II 
Thess.  1 :6).  It  is  possible  that  there  was  an  escort  of  Gentile 
converts  with  Paul  and  Silas  on  this  night  journey  to  Beroea 
which  was  about  fifty  miles  southwest  from  Thessalonica 
near  Pella  in  another  district  of  Macedonia  (Emathia). 
There  is  a  modern  town  there  of  some  6,000  people.  Went 
(apeiesan).  Imperfect  third  plural  active  of  apeimi,  old 
verb  to  go  away,  here  alone  in  the  N.T.  A  literary,  almost 
Atticistic,  form  instead  of  apelthon.  Into  the  synagogue  of  the 
Jews  (eis  ten  sunagogen  ton  loudaion).  Paul's  usual  custom 
and  he  lost  no  time  about  it.  Enough  Jews  here  to  have  a 
synagogue. 

11.  More  noble  than  those  (eugenesteroi  ton).  Comparative 
form  of  eugenes,  old  and  common  adjective,  but  in  N.T.  only 
here  and  Luke  19:12;  I  Cor.  i  :26.  Followed  by  ablative  case 
ton  as  often  after  the  comparative.  With  all  readiness  of  mind 
{meta  pases  prothumias).  Old  word  from  prothumos  (prOy 
thumos)  and  means  eagerness,  rushing  forward.  In  the  N.T. 
only  here  and  II  Cor.  8:11-19;  9:2.  In  Thessalonica  many  of 
the  Jews  out  of  pride  and  prejudice  refused  to  listen.  Here 
the  Jews  joyfully  welcomed  the  two  Jewish  visitors.  Examin- 
ing the  Scriptures  daily  {kath'  hemeran  anakrinontes  tas 
graphas).  Paul  expounded  the  Scriptures  daily  as  in  Thes- 
salonica, but  the  Beroeans,  instead  of  resenting  his  new 
interpretation,  examined  (anakrino  means  to  sift  up  and 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  275 

down,  make  careful  and  exact  research  as  in  legal  processes 
as  in  Acts  4:9;  12:19,  ^'t^O  ^he  Scriptures  for  themselves. 
In  Scotland  people  have  the  Bible  open  on  the  preacher 
as  he  expounds  the  passage,  a  fine  habit  worth  imitating. 
Whether  these  things  were  so  (ei  echoi  tauta  houtos).  Literally, 
"if  these  things  had  it  thus."  The  present  optative  in  the 
indirect  question  represents  an  original  present  indicative 
as  in  Luke  1:29  (Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  I043f.).  This  use 
of  ei  with  the  optative  may  be  looked  at  as  the  condition 
of  the  fourth  class  (undetermined  with  less  likelihood 
of  determination)  as  in  Acts  17:27;  20:16;  24:19;  27:12 
(Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  102 1).  The  Beroeans  were  eagerly 
interested  in  the  new  message  of  Paul  and  Silas  but  they 
wanted  to  see  it  for  themselves.  What  a  noble  attitude. 
Paul's  preaching  made  Bible  students  of  them.  The  duty  of 
private  interpretation  is  thus  made  plain  (Hovey). 

12.  Many  therefore  {Polloi  men  oun).  As  a  result  of  this 
Bible  study.  Also  of  the  Greek  women  of  honourable  estate. 
The  word  Hellenis  means  Greek  woman,  but  the  word  gune 
is  added.  In  particular  women  of  rank  {euschemonon,  from 
eu  and  echo,  graceful  figure  and  the  honourable  standing)  as 
in  13 :50  (Mark  15 :43).  Probably  Luke  means  by  implication 
that  the  "men"  (andrdn)  were  also  noble  Greeks  though  he 
does  not  expressly  say  so.  So  then  the  Jews  were  more  open 
to  the  message,  the  proselytes  or  God-fearers  followed  suit, 
with  "not  a  few"  {ouk  oligoi)  real  Greeks  (both  men  and 
women)  believing.    It  was  quick  and  fine  work. 

13.  Was  proclaimed  (kateggele).  Second  aorist  passive 
indicative  of  kataggello,  common  late  verb  as  in  Acts  16:21. 
Of  Paul  {hupo  Paulou).  By  Paul,  of  course.  Stirring  up  and 
troubling  the  multitudes  {saleuontes  kai  tarassontes  tous  och- 
lous).  Shaking  the  crowds  like  an  earthquake  (4:31)  and 
disturbing  like  a  tornado  (17:8).  Success  at  Thessalonica 
gave  the  rabbis  confidence  and  courage.  The  attack  was 
sharp  and  swift.   The  Jews  from  Antioch  in  Pisidia  had  like- 


276      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

wise  pursued  Paul  to  Iconium  and  Lystra.  How  long  Paul 
had  been  in  Beroea  Luke  does  not  say.  But  a  church  was 
established  here  which  gave  a  good  account  of  itself  later 
and  sent  a  messenger  (Acts  20:4)  with  their  part  of  the  col- 
lection to  Jerusalem.  This  quiet  and  noble  town  was  in  a 
whirl  of  excitement  over  the  attacks  of  the  Jewish  emissaries 
from  Thessalonica  who  probably  made  the  same  charge  of 
treason  against  Paul  and  Silas. 

14.  And  then  immediately  {euthebs  de  tote).  They  acted 
swiftly  as  in  Thessalonica.  Sent  forth  {exapesteilan).  Double 
compound  {ex^  apo,  both  out  and  away)  common  in  late 
Greek.  First  aorist  active  indicative  {exapostello,  liquid 
verb).  Same  form  in  9:30.  As  far  as  to  the  sea  {heos  epi  ten 
thalassan).  It  is  not  clear  whether  Paul  went  all  the  way  to 
Athens  by  land  or  took  ship  at  Dium  or  Pydna,  some  six- 
teen miles  away,  and  sailed  to  Athens.  Some  even  think 
that  Paul  gave  the  Jews  the  slip  and  went  all  the  way  by 
land  when  they  expected  him  to  go  by  sea.  At  any  rate  we 
know  that  Paul  was  grieved  to  cut  short  his  work  in  Mace- 
donia, probably  not  over  six  months  in  all,  which  had  been  so 
fruitful  in  Philippi,  Thessalonica,  and  Beroea.  Silas  and 
Timothy  (note  his  presence)  remained  behind  in  Beroea  and 
they  would  keep  the  work  going.  Paul  no  doubt  hoped  to 
return  soon.  Silas  and  Timothy  in  Beroea  would  also  serve 
to  screen  his  flight  for  the  Jews  wanted  his  blood,  not  theirs. 
The  work  in  Macedonia  spread  widely  (I  Thess.  i  :7f.). 

15.  But  they  that  conducted  Paul  {hoi  de  kathistanontes  ton 
Paulon).  Articular  present  active  participle  of  kathistano 
(late  form  in  A  B  of  kathistemi  or  kathistao),  an  old  verb  with 
varied  uses  to  put  down,  to  constitute,  to  conduct,  etc.  This 
use  here  is  in  the  LXX  (Josh.  6:23)  and  old  Greek  also.  To 
Athens  {heos  Athenbn).  To  make  sure  of  his  safe  arrival. 
That  they  should  come  to  him  with  all  speed  {hina  hos  tachista

junctive) is  also  neat  Greek  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1046). 
Departed  (exeiesan).  Imperfect  active  of  exeimi,  old  Greek 
word,  but  rare  in  N.T.     All  in  Acts  (13:42;  17:15;  20:7; 

27:43) 

16.  Now  while  Paul  waited  for  them  in  Athens  {En  de  tais 
Athenais  ekdechomenou  autous  tou  Paulou).  Genitive  absolute 
with  present  middle  participle  of  ekdechomai,  old  verb  to 
receive,  but  only  with  the  sense  of  looking  out  for,  expecting 
found  here  and  elsewhere  in  N.T,  We  know  that  Timothy 
did  come  to  Paul  in  Athens  (I  Thess.  3:1,  6)  from  Thessa- 
lonica  and  was  sent  back  to  them  from  Athens.  H  Silas  also 
came  to  Athens,  he  was  also  sent  away,  possibly  to  Philippi, 
for  that  church  was  deeply  interested  in  Paul.  At  any  rate 
both  Timothy  and  Silas  came  from  Macedonia  to  Corinth 

^with  messages  and  relief  for  Paul  (Acts  18:5;  II  Cor.  ii:8f.). 

/  Before  they  came  and  after  they  left,  Paul  felt  lonely  in 

'  Athens  (I  Thess.  3:1),  the  first  time  on  this  tour  or  the  first 
that  he  has  been  completely  without  fellow  workers.  Athens 
had  been  captured  by  Sulla  B.C.  86.  After  various  changes 
Achaia,  of  which  Corinth  is  the  capital,  is  a  separate  province 
from  Macedonia  and  a.d.  44  was  restored  by  Claudius  to 
the  Senate  with  the  Proconsul  at  Corinth.  Paul  is  probably 
here  about  a.d.  50.  Politically  Athens  is  no  longer  of  impor- 
tance when  Paul  comes  though  it  is  still  the  univergity^eat 
of  the  world  with  all  its  rich  environment  and  traditions. 
Rackham  grows  eloquent  over  Paul  the  Jew  of  Tarsus  being 
in  the  city  of  Pericles  and  Demosthenes,  Socrates  and  Plate 
and  Aristotle,  Sophocles  and  Euripides.  In  its  Agora  Socrates 
had  taught,  here  was  the  Academy  of  Plato,  the  Lyceum  of 
Aristotle,  the  Porch  of  Zeno,  the  Garden  of  Epicurus.   Here 

/  men  still  talked  about  philosophy,  poetry,  politics,  religion, 
anything  and  everything.  It  was  the  art  centre  of  the  world. 
The  Parthenon,  the  most  beautiful  of  temples,  crowned  the 
Acropolis.    Was  Paul  insensible  to  all  this  cultural  environ-

ment?  It  is  hard  to  think  so  for  he  was  a  university  man  of 
Tarsus  and  he  makes  a  number  of  allusions  to  Greek  writers. 
Probably  it  had  not  been  in  Paul's  original  plan  to  evangelize 
Athens,  difficult  as  all  university  seats  are,  but  he  cannot 
be  idle  though  here  apparently  by  chance  because  driven  out 
of  Macedonia.  Was  provoked  {par oxuneio).  Imperfect  passive 
of  paroxunby  old  verb  to  sharpen,  to  stimulate,  to  irritate 
(from  para,  oxus),  from  paroxusmos  (Acts  15:39),  common  in 
old  Greek,  but  in  N.T.  only  here  and  I  Cor.  13:5.  It  was  a 
continual  challenge  to  Paul's  spirit  when  he  beheld  [theo- 
rountos,  genitive  of  present  participle  agreeing  with  autou 
(his),  though  late  MSS.  have  locative  theorounti  agreeing 
with  en  autot\.  The  city  full  of  idols  (kateidolon  ousan  ten 
polin).  Note  the  participle  ousan  not  preserved  in  the 
English  (either  the  city  being  full  of  idols  or  that  the  city 
\  was  full  of  idols,  sort  of  indirect  discourse).  Paul,  like  any 
\  stranger  was  looking  at  the  sights  as  he  walked  around. 
This  adjective  kateidolon  (perfective  use  of  kata  and  eidolon 
is  found  nowhere  else,  but  it  is  formed  after  the  analogy  of 
katampelos,  katadendron),  full  of  idols.  Xenophon  (de  Republ. 
Ath.)  calls  the  city  hole  bomos,  hole  thuma  theois  kai  ana- 
thema (all  altar,  all  sacrifice  and  oflFering  to  the  gods).  These 
statues  were  beautiful,  but,  Paul  was  not  deceived  J2y__the_ 
mere  art  for  art's  sake.  The  idolatry  and  sensualism  of 
it  all  glared  at  him  (Rom.  1:18-32).  Renan  ridicules  Paul's 
ignorance  in  taking  these  statues  for  idols,  but  Paul  knew 
paganism  better  than  Renan.  The  superstition  of  this  centre 
of  Greek  culture  was  depressing  to  Paul.  One  has  only  to  re- 
call how  superstitious  cults  today  flourish  in  the  atmosphere 
of  Boston  and  Los  Angeles  to  understand  conditions  in 
Athens.  Pausanias  says  that  Athens  had  more  images  than 
all  the  rest  of  Greece  put  together.  Pliny  states  that  in  the 
time  of  Nero  Athens  hnd  over  30,000  public  statues  besides 
countless  private  ones  in  the  homes.  Petronius  sneers  that 
it  was  easier  to  find  a  god  than  a  man  in  Athens.     Every 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  279 

gateway  or  porch  had  its  protecting  god.  They  lined  the 
street  from  the  Piraeus  and  caught  the  eye  at  every  place  of 
prominence  on  wall  or  in  the  agora. 

17.  So  he  reasoned  {dielegeto  men  oun).  Accordingly  there- 
fore, with  his  spirit  stirred  by  the  proof  of  idolatry.  Imper- 
fect middle  of  dialego,  same  verb  used  in  verse  2  which  see. 
First  he  reasoned  in  the  synagogue  at  the  services  to  the 
Jews  and  the  God-fearers,  then  daily  in  the  agora  or  market- 
place (southwest  of  the  Acropolis,  between  it  and  the  Are- 
opagus and  the  Pnyx)  to  the  chance-comers,  "them  that  met 
I  him"   (pros  tous  paratugchanontas).      Simultaneously  with 

the  synagogue  preaching  at  other  hours  Paul  took  his  stand 
like  Socrates  before  him  and  engaged  in  conversation  with 
{pros)  those  who  happened  by.  This  old  verb,  paratugchanb^ 
occurs  here  alone  in  the  N.T.  and  accurately  pictures  the 
life  in  the  agora.  The  listeners  to  Paul  in  the  agora  would 
be  more  casual  than  those  who  stop  for  street  preaching,  a 
Salvation  Army  meeting,  a  harangue  from  a  box  in  Hyde 
Park.  It  ^yas  a  slim  chance  either  in  synagogue  or  in  agora, 
but  Paul  could  not  remain  still  with  all  the  reeking  idolatry 
around  him.  The  boundaries  of  the  agora  varied,  but  there 
was  always  the  Poikile  Stoa  (the  Painted  Porch),  over 
against  the  Acropolis  on  the  west.  In  this  Stoa  (Porch)  Zeno 
and  other  philosophers  and  rhetoricians  held  forth  from 
time  to  time.    Paul  may  have  stood  near  this  spot. 

18.  And  certain  also  of  the  Epicurean  and  Stoic  philos- 
ophers encountered  him  {tines  de  kai  ton  Epikourion  kai 
Stoikon  philosophon  suneballon  autbi).    Imperfect  active  of 

I  sunballo,  old  verb,  in  the  N.T.  only  by  Luke,  to  bring  or  put 
'  together  in  one's  mind  (Luke  2:19),  to  meet  together  (Acts 
20:14),  to  bring  together  aid  (18:27),  to  confer  or  converse  or 
dispute  as  here  and  already  4:15  which  see.  These  profes- 
sional philosophers  were  always  ready  for  an  argument  and 
so  they  frequented  the  agora  for  that  purpose.  Luke  uses 
one  article  and  so  groups  the  two  sects  together  in  their 


28o      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

attitude  toward  Paul,  but  they  were  very  different  in  fact. 
Both  sects  were  eager  for  argument  and  both  had  disdain 
for  Paul,  but  they  were  the  two  rival  practical  philosophies 
of  the  day,  succeeding  the  more  abstruse  theories  of  Plato 
and  Aristotle.  Socrates  had  turned  men's  thought  inward 
(Gnothi  Seautouy  "Know  Thyself)  away  from  the  mere  study 
of  physics.  Plato  followed  with  a  profound  development 
of  the  inner  self  (metaphysics).  Aristotle  with  his  cyclopae- 
dic grasp  sought  to  unify  and  relate  both  physics  and  meta- 
physics. Both  Zeno  and  Epicurus  (340-272  b.c.)  took  a  more 
practical  turn  in  all  this  intellectual  turmoil  and  raised  the 
issues  of  everyday  life.  Zeno  (360-260  b.c.)  taught  in  the 
Stoa  (Porch)  and  so  his  teaching  was  called  Stoicism.  He 
advanced  many  noble  ideas  that  found  their  chief  illustration 
in  the  Roman  philosophers  (Seneca,  Epictetus,  Marcus 
Aurelius).  He  taught  self-mastery  and  hardness  with  an 
austerity  that  ministered  to  pride  or  suicide  in  case  of 
failure,  a  distinctly  selfish  and  unloving  view  of  life  and  with 
a  pantheistic  philosophy.  Epicurus  considered  practical^ 
atheism  the  true  view  of  the  universe  and  denied  a  future 
life  and  claimed  pleasure  as  the  chief  thing  to  be  gotten 
out  of  life.  He  did  not  deny  the  existence  of  gods,  but  re- 
garded  them  as  unconcerned  with  the  life  of  men.  The  Stoics 
called  Epicurus  an  atheist.  Lucretius  and  Horace  give  the 
Epicurean  view  of  life  in  their  great  poems.  This  low  view 
^  of  life  led  to  sensualism  and  does  today,  for  both  Stoicism 
and  Epicureanism  are  widely  influential  with  people  now. 
"Eat  and  drink  for  tomorrow  we  die,"  they  preached.  Paul 
had  doubtless  become  acquainted  with  both  of  these  philoso- 
phies for  they  were  widely  prevalent  over  the  world.  Here 
he  confronts  them  in  their  very  home.  He  is  challenged  by 
past-masters  in  the  art  of  appealing  to  the  senses,  men  as 
skilled  in  their  dialectic  as  the  Pharisaic  rabbis  with  whom 
Paul  had  been  trained  and  whose  subtleties  he  had  learned 
how  to  expose.    But,  so  far  as  we  know,  this  is  a  new  expe- 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  281 

rience  for  Paul  to  have  a  public  dispute  with  these  philosoph- 
ical experts  who  had  a  natural  contempt  for  all  Jews  and  for 
rabbis  in  particular,  though  they  found  Paul  a  new  type  at 
any  rate  and  so  with  some  interest  in  him.  "In  Epicurean- 
ism, it  was  man's  sensual  nature  which  arrayed  Itself  against 
the  claims  of  the  gospel;  in  Stoicism  it  was  his  self-righteous- 
ness and  pride  of  intellect"  (Hackett).  Knowling  calls  the 
Stoic  the  Pharisee  of  philosophy  and  the  Epicurean  the  Sad- 
ducee  of  philosophy.  Socrates  in  this  very  agora  used  to  try 
to  interest  the  passers-by  in  some  desire  for  better  things. 
That  was  450  years  before  Paul  is  challenged  by  these 
superficia.LsaphisticaJ  Epicureans  and  Stoics.  It  is  doubtful 
if  Paul  had  ever  met  a  more  difficult  situation.  What  would 
this  babbler  say?  (Ti  an  theloi  ho  spermologos  houtos  legein?). 
The  word  for  "babbler "  means  "seed-picker "  or  picker  up  of 
seeds  {sperma,  seed,  lego,  to  collect)  like  a  bird  in  the  agora 
hopping  about  after  chance  seeds.  Plutarch  applies  the 
word  to  crows  that  pick  up  grain  in  the  fields.  Demosthenes 
called  Aeschines  a  spermologos.  Eustathius  uses  it  of  a  man 
hanging  around  in  the  markets  picking  up  scraps  of  food 
that  fell  from  the  carts  and  so  also  of  mere  rhetoricians  and 
\/  plagiarists  who  picked  up  scraps  of  wisdom  from  others. 
Ramsay  considers  it  here  a  piece  of  Athenian  slang  used  to 
describe  the  picture  of  Paul  seen  by  these  philosophers  who 
use  it,  for  not  all  of  them  had  it  ("some,"  tines).  Note  the 
use  of  an  and  the  present  active  optative  theloi,  conclusion 
of  a  fourth-class  condition  in  a  rhetorical  question  (Robert- 
son, Grammar,  p.  1021).  It  means,  What  would  this  picker 
iip_^of_seeds  wish  to  say,  if  he  should  get  oif  an  idea.'*  It  is  a 
contemptuous  tone  of  supreme_j:jdicule  and  doubtless  Paul 
/  heard  this  comment.  Probably  the  Epicureans  made  this 
sneer  that  Paul  was  a_charlata_a  or^quack.  Other  some  {hoi 
de).  But  others,  in  contrast  with  the  "some"  just  before. 
Perhaps  the  Stoics  take  this  more  serious  view  of  Paul.  He 
seemeth  to  be  a  setter  forth  of  strange  gods  (zenon  daimonion 


282      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

dokei  kataggeleus  einai).  This  view  is  put  cautiously  by  dokei 
(seems).  Kataggeleus  does  not  occur  in  the  old  Greek,  though 
in  ecclesiastical  writers,  but  Deissmann  {Light  from  the 
Ancient  East,  p.  99)  gives  an  example  of  the  word  "on  a 
marble  stele  recording  a  decree  of  the  Mitylenaens  in  honour 
of  the  Emperor  Augustus,"  where  it  is  the  herald  of  the 
games.  Here  alone  in  the  N.T.  Daimonion  is  used  in 
the  old  Greek  sense  of  deity  or  divinity  whether  good  or 
bad,  not  in  the  N.T.  sense  of  demons.  Both  this  word  and 
kataggeleus  are  used  from  the  Athenian  standpoint.  Xenos 
is  an  old  word  for  a  guest-friend  (Latin  hospes)  and  then  host 
(Rom.  16:23),  then  for  foreigner  or  stranger  (Matt.  25:31; 
Acts  17:21),  new  and  so  strange  as  here  and  Heb.  13:9;  I 
Peter  4:12,  and  then  aliens  (Eph.  2:12).  This  view  of  Paul 
is  the  first  count  against  Socrates:  Socrates  does  wrong,  in- 
troducing new  deities  {adikei  Sokrates,  kaina  daimonia 
eispheron,  Xen.  Alem.  i).  On  this  charge  the  „AthenIaijs 
voted  the  hemlock  for  their  greatest  citizen.  What  will  they 
do  to  Paul.^  This  Athens  was  more  sceptical  and  more 
tolerant  than  the  old  Athens.  But  Roman  law  did  not  allow 
the  introduction  of  a  new  religion  {religio  illicita).  Paul  was 
1  walking  on  thin  ice  though  he  was  the  real  master  philosopher 
and  these  Epicureans  and  Stoics  were  quacks.  Paul  had  the 
I  only  true  philosophy  of  the  universe  and  life  with  Jesus 
pChrist  as  the  centre  (Col.  i :  12-20),  the  greatest  of_alIj2hiloso- 
phers  as  Ramsay  justly  terms  him.  But  these  men  are  mock- 
ing him.  Because  he  preached  Jesus  and  the  resurrection  {hoti 
ton  lesoun  kai  ten  anastasin  eueggelizato).  Reason  for  the 
view  just  stated.  Imperfect  middle  indicative  of  euaggelizo, 
to  "gospelize."  Apparently  these  critics  considered  anastasis 
(Resurrection)  another  deity  on  a  par  with  Jesus.  The 
Athenians  worshipped  all  sorts  of  abstract  truths  and  vir- 
tues and  they  misunderstood  Paul  on  this  subject.  They 
will  leave  him  as  soon  as  he  mentions  the  resurrection 
(verse    32).      It  is  objected  that  Luke  would  not  use  the 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  283 

word  in  this  sense  here  for  his  readers  would  not  under- 
stand him.  But  Luke  is  describing  the  misapprehension 
of  this  group  of  philosophers  and  this  interpretation  fits  in 
precisely. 

19.  And  they  took  hold  of  him  {epilahomenoi  de  autou). 
Second  aorist  middle  participle  of  epilambano,  old  verb, 
but  in  the  N.T.  only  in  the  middle,  here  with  the  genitive 
autou  to  lay  hold  of,  but  with  no  necessary  sense  of  violence 
(Acts  9:27;  23:27;  Mark  8:23),  unless  the  idea  is  that 
Paul  was  to  be  tried  before  the  Court  of  Areopagus  for  the 
\crime  of  bringing  in  strange  gods.  But  the  day  for  that  had 
passed  in  Athens.  Even  so  it  is  not  clear  whether  ^^unto 
the  Areopagus  {epi  ton  Areion  Pagon^^)  means  the  Hill  of 
Mars  (west  of  the  Acropolis,  north  of  the  agora  and  reached 
by  a  flight  of  steps  in  the  rock)  or  the  court  itself  which 
met  elsewhere  as  well  as  on  the  hills,  usually  in  fact  in  the 
Stoa  Basilica  opening  on  the  agora  and  near  to  the  place 
where  the  dispute  had  gone  on.  Raphael's  cartoon  with  Paul 
standing  on  Mars  Hill  has  made  us  all  familiar  with  the 
common  view,  but  it  is  quite  uncertain  if  it  is  true.  There 
was  not  room  on  the  summit  for  a  large  gathering.  If  Paul 
was  brought  before  the  Court  of  Areopagus  (commonly  called 
the  Areopagus  as  here),  it  was  not  for  trial  as  a  criminal,  but 
simply  for  examination  concerning  his  new  teaching  in  this 
university  city  whether  it  was  strictly  legal  or  not.  Paul 
was  really  engaged  in  proselytism  to  turn  the  Athenians 
away  from  their  old  gods  to  Jesus  Christ.  But  "the  court 
of  refined  and  polished  Athenians  was  very  different  from 
the  rough  provincial  magistrates  of  Philippi,  and  the  philoso- 
phers who  presented  Paul  to  their  cognizance  very  different 
from  the  mob  of  Thessalonians"  (Rackham).  Itwas^all  very 
polite.  May  we  know?  {Dunametha  gnonai).  Can  we  come 
to  know  (ingressive  second  aorist  active  infinitive).  This  new 
teaching  {he  kaine  haute  didache).  On  the  position  of  haute 
see    Robertson,    Grammar,    pp.    70of.    The    question    was 


284      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

prompted  by  courtesy,  sarcasm,  or  irony.      Evidently  no 
definite  charge  was  laid  against  Paul. 

20.  For  thou  bringest  certain  strange  things  {xenizonta  gar 
tina  eisphereis).  The  very  verb  used  by  Xenophon  {Mem.  i) 
about  Socrates.  Xenizonta  is  present  active  neuter  plural 
participle  of  xenizo  and  from  xenos  (verse  18),  "things  sur- 
prising or  shocking  us."  fVe  would  know  therefore  (boulometha 
oun  gnonai).  Very  polite  still,  we  wish  or  desire,  and  repeat- 
ing gnonai  (the  essential  point). 

21.  Spent  their  time  (eukairoun).  Imperfect  active  of  euk- 
aireo.  A  late  word  to  have  opportunity  (eu,  kairos)  from 
Polybius  on.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Mark  6:31.  They 
had  time  for,,  etc.  This  verse  is  an  explanatory  parenthesis 
by  Luke.  Some  new  thing  {ti  kainoteron).  Literally  "some- 
thing newer"  or  "fresher"  than  the  new,  the  very  latest, 
the  comparative  of  kainos.  Demosthenes  {Philipp.  I.  43) 
pictures  the  Athenians  "in  the  agora  inquiring  if  anything 
newer  is  said"  {punthanomenoi  kata  ten  agoran  ei  ti  legetai 
neoteron).  .The  new  soon  became  stale  with  these  itching 
and    frivolous    Athenians. 

22.  Stood  in  the  midst  0/  the  Areopagus  (statheis  en  mesoi 
tou  Areiou  Pagou).  First  aorist  passive  of  histemi  used  of 
Peter  in  2:14.  Majestic  figure  whether  on  Mars  Hill  or  in 
the  Stoa  Basilica  before  the  Areopagus  Court.  There  would 
be  a  crowd  of  spectators  and  philosophers  in  either  case  and 
Paul  seized  the  opportunity  to  preach  Christ  to  this  strange 
audience  as  he  did  in  Caesarea  before  Herod  Agrippa  and 
the  crowd  of  prominent  people  gathered  by  Festus  for  the 
entertainment.  Paul  does  not  speak  as  a  man  on  trial,  but 
as  one  trying  to  get  a  hearing  for  the  gospel  of  Christ.  Some- 
what superstitious  (hos  deisidaimonesterous) .  The  Authorized 
Version  has  "too  superstitious,"  the  American  Standard 
"very  religious."  Deisidaimon  is  a  neutral  word  (from 
deidoj  to  fear,  and  daimon,  deity).  The  Greeks  used  it  either 
in  the  good  sense  of  pious  or  religious  or  the  bad  sense  of 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  285 

superstitious.  Thayer  suggests  that  Paul  uses  it  "with 
kindly  ambiguity."  Page  thinks  that  Luke  uses  the  word  to 
represent  the  religious  feeling  of  the  Athenians  (religiosus) 
which  bordered  on  superstition.  The  Vulgate  has  super- 
stitiosiores.  In  25:19  Festus  uses  the  term  deisidaimonia  for 
"religion."  It  seems  unlikely  that  Paul  should  give  this 
audience  a  slap  in  the  face  at  the  very  start.  The  way  one 
takes  this  adjective  here  colours  Paul's  whole  speech  before 
the  Council  of  Areopagus.  The  comparative  here  as  in  verse 
21  means  more  religions  than  usual  (Robertson,  Grammar, 
pp.  66^i.),  the  object  of  the  comparison  not  being  expressed. 
The  Athenians  had  a  tremendous  reputation  for  their  de- 
votion to  religion,  "full  of  idols"  (verse  16). 

23.  For  {gar).  Paul  gives  an  illustration  of  their  reli- 
giousness from  his  own  experiences  in  their  city.  The  objects 
of  your  worship  {ta  sebasmata  humbn).  Late  word  from 
sebazomai,  to  worship.  In  N.T.  only  here  and  II  Thess.  2:4. 
The  use  of  this  word  for  temples,  altars,  statues,  shows  the 
conciliatory  tone  in  the  use  of  deisidaimonesterous  in  verse  22. 
An  altar  (bdmon).  Old  word,  only  here  in  the  N.T.  and  the 
only  mention  of  a  heathen  altar  in  the  N.T.  With  this  inscrip- 
tion (en  hoi  epegegrapto).  On  which  had  been  written  (stood 
written),  past  perfect  passive  indicative  of  epigrapho,  old 
and  common  verb  for  writing  on  inscriptions  (epigraph?, 
Luke  23:38).  To  an  Unknown  God  [AGNOSTO  THEO). 
Dative  case,  dedicated  to.  Pausanias  (I.  i,  4)  says  that  in 
Athens  there  are  "altars  to  gods  unknown"  {bomoi  theon 
agnoston).  Epimenides  in  a  pestilence  advised  the  sacri- 
fice of  a  sheep  to  the  befitting  god  whoever  Ke  might  be.  If 
an  altar  was  dedicated  to  the  wrong  deity,  the  Athenians 
feared  the  anger  of  the  other  gods.  The  only  use  in  the  N.T. 
of  agnostos,  old  and  common  adjective  (from  a  privative  and 
gnbstos  verbal  of  ginosko,  to  know).  Our  word  agnostic  comes 
from  it.  Here  it  has  an  ambiguous  meaning,  but  Paul  uses 
it  though  to  a  stern  Christian  philosopher  it  may  be  the 


286      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

"confession  at  once  of  a  bastard  philosophy  and  of  a  bastard 
religion"  (Hort,  Hulsean  Lectures,^.  64).  Paul  was  quick  to 
use  this  confession  on  the  part  of  the  Athenians  of  a  higher 
power  than  yet  known  to  them.  So  he  gets  his  theme  from 
this  evidence  of  a  deeper  religious  sense  in  them  and  makes 
a  most  clever  use  of  it  with  consummate  skill.  In  ignorance 
{agnoountes).  Present  active  participle  of  agnoeo,  old  verb 
from  same  root  as  agnostos  to  which  Paul  refers  by  using  it. 
This  set  I  forth  unto  you  {touto  ego  kataggello  humin).  He  is  a 
kataggeleus  (verse  18)  as  they  suspected  of  a  God,  both  old 
and  new,  old  in  that  they  already  worship  him,  new  in  that 
Paul  knows  who  he  is.  By  this  master  stroke  he  has  brushed 
to^one^ideany  notion  of  violation  of  Roman  law  or  suspicion 
of  heresy  and  claims  their  endorsement  of  his  new  gospel,  a 
shrewd  and  consummate  turn.  He  has  their  attention  now  and 
proceeds  to  describe  this  God  left  out  of  their  list  as  the 
one  true  and  Supreme  God.  The  later  MSS.  here  read 
hon — touton  (whom — this  one)  rather  than  ho — touto  (what — 
this),  but  the  late  text  is  plainly  an  effort  to  introduce  too 
soon  the  personal  nature  of  God  which  comes  out  clearly 
in  verse  24. 

24.  The  God  that  made  the  world  {Ho  theos  ho  poiesas  ton 
kosmon).  Not  a  god  for  this  and  a  god  for  that  like  the  30,000 
gods  of  the  Athenians,  but  the  one  God  who  made  the  Uni- 
verse (kosmos  on  the  old  Greek  sense  of  orderly  arrangement 
of  the  whole  universe).  And  all  things  therein  {kai  panta  ta 
en  autbi).  All  the  details  in  the  universe  were  created  by  this 
one  God.  Paul  is  using  the  words  of  Isa.  42^.  The  Epi- 
cureans held  that  matter  was  eternal.  Paul  sets  them  aside. 
This  one  God  was  not  to  be  confounded  with  any  of  their 
numerous  gods  save  with  this  "Unknown  God."  Being 
Lord  oj  heaven  and  earth  {ouranou  kai  ges  huparchon  kurios). 
Kurios  here  owner,  absolute  possessor  of  both  heaven  and 
earth  (Isa.  457),  not  of  just  parts.  Dwelleth  not  in  temples 
made  with  hands  iouken  cheiropoietois  naois  katoikei).    The 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  287 

old  adjective  cheiropoietos  (cheir,  poieo)  already  in  Stephen's 
speech  (7:48).  No  doubt  Paul  pointed  to  the  wonderful 
Parthenon,  supposed  to  be  the  home  of  Athene  as  Stephen 
denied  that  God  dwelt  alone  in  the  temple  in  Jerusalem. 

25.  As  though  he  needed  anything  (prosdeomenos  tinos). 
Present  middle  participle  of  prosdeomaij  to  want  besides, 
old  verb,  but  here  only  in  the  N.T.  This  was  strange  doc- 
trine for  the  people  thought  that  the  gods  needed  their 
offerings  for  full  happiness.  This  self-sufficiency  of  God  was 
taught  by  Philo  and  Lucretius,  but  Paul  shows  that  the 
Epicurean  missed  it  by  putting  God,  if  existing  at  all,,  out: 
side  the  universe.  Seeing  he  himself  giveth  to  all  {autos  didous 
pasin).  This  Supreme  Personal  God  is  the  source  of  life, 
breath,  and  everything.  Paul  here  rises  above  all  Greek 
philosophers. 

26.  And  he  made  of  one  (epoiesen  te  ex  henos).  The  word 
haimatos  (blood)  is  absent  from  Aleph  A  B  and  is  a  later 
explanatory  addition.  What  Paul  affirms  is  the  unity  of  the 
human  race  with  a  common  origin  and  with  God  as  the 
Creator.  This  view  runs  counter  to  Greek  exclusiveness 
which  treated  other  races  as  barbarians  and  to  Jewish  pride 
which  treated  other  nations  as  heathen  or  pagan  (the  Jews 
were  laos,  the  Gentiles  ethne).  The  cosmopolitanism  of  Paul 
here  rises  above  Jew  and  Greek  and  claims  the  one  God  as 
the  Creator  of  the  one  race  of  men.  The  Athenians  them- 
selves claimed  to  be  antochthonous  (indigenous)  and  a  special 
creation.  Zeno  and  Seneca  did  teach  a  kind  of  cosmopoli- 
tanism (really  pantheism)  far  different  from  the  personal 
God  of  Paul.  It  was  Rome,  not  Greece,  that  carried  out 
the  moral  ideas  of  Zeno.  Man  is  part  of  the  universe  (verse 
24)  and  God  created  {epoiesen)  man  as  he  created  (poiesas) 
the  all.  For  to  dwell  (katoikein).  Infinitive  (present  active) 
of  purpose,  so  as  to  dwell.  Having  determined  (horisas). 
First  aorist  active  participle  of  horizo,  old  verb  to  make  a 
horizon  as  already  in  19:42  which  sec.     Paul  here  touches

God's  Providence.  God  has  revealed  himself  in  history  as 
in  creation.  His  hand  appears  in  the  history  of  all  men  as 
well  as  in  that  of  the  Chosen  People  of  Israel.  Appointed 
seasons  {prostetagmenous  kairous).  Not  the  weather  as  in 
14:17,  but  "the  times  of  the  Gentiles"  (kairoi  ethnon)  of 

t  which  Jesus  spoke  (Luke  21 124).  The  perfect  passive  partici- 
ple of  prostasso,  old  verb  to  enjoin,  emphasizes  God's  con- 
trol of  human  history  without  any  denial  of  human  free 
agency  as  was  involved  in  the  Stoic  Fate  {Heirmarmene). 
Bounds  {horothesias).  Limits.''  Same  idea  in  Job  12:23. 
Nations  rise  and  fall,  but  it  is  not  blind  chance  or  hard  fate. 
Thus  there  is  an  interplay  betwen  God's  will  and  man's 
activities,  difficult  as  it  is  for  us  to  see  with  our  shortened 
vision. 

27.  That  they  should  seek  God  {Zetein  ton  theon).  Infinitive 
(present  active)  of  purpose  again.  Seek  him,  not  turn  away 
from  him  as  the  nations  had  done  (Rom.  i :  18-3 2).  //  haply 
they  might  feel  after  him  {ei  ara  ge  pselapheseian  auton). 
First  aorist  active  (Aeolic  form)  optative  of  pselaphao,  old 
/  verb  from  psao,  to  touch.    So  used  by  the  Risen  Jesus  in  his 

y  challenge  to  the  disciples  (Luke  24:39),  by  the  Apostle  John 
of  his  personal  contact  with  Jesus  (I  John  i:i),  of  the  con- 
tact with  Mount  Sinai  (Heb.  12:18).  Here  it  pictures  the 
blind  groping  of  the  darkened  heathen  mind  after  God  to 
"find  him"  (heuroien,  second  aorist  active  optative)  whom 
they  had  lost.  One  knows  what  it  is  in  a  darkened  room  to 
feel  along  the  walls  for  the  door  (Deut.  28:29;  Job  5:14; 
12:25;  Isa.  59:10).  Helen  Keller,  when  told  of  God,  said  that 
she  knew  of  him  already,  groping  in  the  dark  after  him.  The 
optative  here  with  ei  is  due  to  the  condition  of  the  fourth 
class  (undetermined,  but  with  vague  hope  of  being  deter- 
mined) with  aim  also  present  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1021). 
Note  also  ara  ge  the  inferential  particle  ara  with  the  delicate 
intensive  particle  ge.  Though  he  is  not  far  from  each  one  of  us

More  exactly  with  B  L  {kai  ge  instead  of  kaitoi  or  kaitoi  ge), 
"and  yet  being  not  far  from  each  one  of  us,"  a  direct  state- 
ment rather  than  a  concessive  one.  The  participle  hupar- 
chonta  agrees  with  auton  and  the  negative  ou  rather  than  the 
usual  me  with  the  participle  makes  an  emphatic  negative. 
Note  also  the  intensive  particle  ge. 

28.  For  in  him  {en  autoi  gar).  Proof  of  God's  nearness,  not 
stoic  pantheism,  but  real  immanence  in  God  asTjoTdweils 
in  us.  The  three  verbs  (zomen,  kinoumetha,  esmen)  form  an 
ascending  scalejind  reach  a  climax  in^God  (life>  movement, 
existence).  Kinbumetha  is  either  direct  middle  present  indica- 
tive (we  move  ourselves)  or  passive  (we  are  moved).  As  cer- 
tain even  of  your  own  poets  (hos  kai  tines  ton  kath*  humds 
poieton).  "As  also  some  of  the  poets  among  you."  Aratus  of 
Soli  in  Cilicia  (ab.  B.C.  270)  has  these  very  words  in  his  Ta 
Phainomena  and  Cleanthes,  Stoic  philosopher  (300-220  b.c.) 
in  his  Hymn  to  Zeus  has  Ek  sou  gar  genos  esmen.  In  I  Cor. 
15:32  Paul  quotes  from  Menander  and  in  Titus  1:12  from 
Epimenides.  J.  Rendel  Harris  claims  that  he  finds  allusions 
in  Paul's  Epistles  to  Pindar,  Aristophanes,  and  other  Greek 
writers.  There  is  no  reason  in  the  world  why  Paul  should  not 
have  acquaintance  with  Greek  literature,  though  one  need 
not  strain  a  point  to  prove  it.  Paul,  of  course,  knew  that 
the  words  were  written  of  Zeus  (Jupiter),  not  of  Jehovah, 
but  he  applies  the  idea  in  them  to  his  point  just  made  that 
all  men  are  the  offspring  of  God. 

29.  fFe  ought  not  to  think  (ouk  opheilomen  nomizein).  It  is 
a  logical  conclusion  {oun^  therefore)  from  the  very  language  of 
Aratus  and  Cleanthes.  That  the  Godhead  is  like  {to  theion 
einai  homoion).  Infinitive  with  accusative  of  general  refer- 
ence in  indirect  discourse.  To  theion  is  strictly  "the  divine" 
nature  like  theiotes  (Rom.  l  :2o)  rather  than  like  theotes  (Col. 
2:9).  Paul  may  have  used  to  theion  here  to  get  back  behind 
all  their  notions  of  various  gods  to  the  real  nature  of  God. 
The  Athenians  may  even  have  used  the  term  themselves.

After  homoios  (like)  the  associative  instrumental  case  is  used 
as  with  chrusoi,  arguroi,  liihoi.  Graven  by  art  and  device  of  man 
{charagmati  iechnes  kai  enthumeseos  anthrdpou).  Apposition 
with  preceding  and  so  charagmati  in  associative  instrumental 
case.  Literally,  graven  work  or  sculpture  from  charasso,  to 
engrave,  old  word,  but  here  alone  in  N.T.  outside  of  Revela- 
tion (the  mark  of  the  beast).  Graven  work  of  art  {technes)  or 
external  craft,  and  of  thought  or  device  {enthumeseos)  or 
internal  conception  of  man. 

30.  The  times  of  ignorance   {tous  chronous  tes  agnoias). 
^ThetLmes  before  full  knowledge  of  God  came  in  Jesus  Christ. 

Paul  uses  the  very  word  for  their  ignorance  (agnoountes) 
employed  in  verse  23.  Overlooked  (huperidon).  Second  aorist 
active  participle  of  huperorao  or  hupereidoj  old  verb  to  see 
beyond,  not  to  see,  to  overlook,  not  "to  wink  at"  of  the 
Authorized  Version  with  the  notion  of  condoning.  Here  only 
in  the  N.T.  It  occurs  in  the  LXX  in  the  sense  of  overlooking 
or  neglecting  (Psa.  18:62;  55:1).  But  it  has  here  only  a  nega- 
tive force.  God  has  all  the  time  objected  to  the  polytheism 
of  the  heathen,  and  now  he  has  made  it  plain.  In  Wisdom 
11:23  we  have  these  words:  "Thou  overlookest  the  sins  of 
men  to  the  end  they  may  repent."  But  now  (ta  nun).  Accusa- 
tive of  general  reference,  "as  to  the  now  things  or  situation." 
All  is  changed  now  that  Christ  has  come  with  the  full  knowl- 
edge of  God.  See  also  27:22.  /^ll  everywhere  {pantas  panta- 
chou).  No  exceptions  anywhere.  Repent  (metanoein) .  Present 
active  infinitive  of  metanoed  in  indirect  command,  a  per- 
manent command  of  perpetual  force.  See  on  metanoed  Acts 
2:38  and  the  Synoptic  Gospels.  This  word  was  the  message 
of  the  Baptist,  of  Jesus,  of  Peter,  of  Paul,  this  radical  change 
of  attitude  and  life. 

31.  Inasmuch  as  (kathoti).  According  as  {kata^  hoti).  Old 
causal  conjunction,  but  in  N.T.  only  used  in  Luke's  writings 
(Luke  1:7;  19:9;  Acts  2:45;  4:35;  17:31).  Hath  appointed  a 
day    {est? sen   hemeran).      First   aorist   active   indicative   of

hvstemi,  to  place,  set.  God  did  set  the  day  in  his  counsel  and 
he  will  fulfil  it  in  his  own  time.  Will  judge  {mellei  krinein). 
Rather,  is  going  to  judge,  mello  and  the  present  active  in- 
finitive of  krino.  Paul  here  quotes  Psa.  9:8  where  krinei  ^ 
occurs.  By  the  man  whom  he  hath  ordained  {en  andri  hoi 
horisen).  Here  he  adds  to  the  Psalm  the  place  and  function 
of  Jesus  Christ,  a  passage  in  harmony  with  Christ's  own 
words  in  Matt.  25.  Hoi  (whom)  is  attracted  from  the 
accusative,  object  of  horisen  (first  aorist  active  indicative 
of  horizo)  to  the  case  of  the  antecedent  andri.  It  has  been 
said  that  Paul  left  the  simple  gospel  in  this  address  to  the 
council  of  the  Areopagus  for  philosophy.  But  did  he.''  He 
skilfully  caught  their  attention  by  reference  to  an  altar  to 
an  Unknown  God  whom  he  interprets  to  be  the  Creator  of 
all  things  and  all  men  who  overrules  the  whole  world  and 
who  now  commands  repentance  of  all  and  has  revealed  his 
will  about  a  day  of  reckoning  when  Jesus  Christ  will  be 
Judge.  He  has  pj;eached  the  unity  of  God,  the  one  and  only 
God,  has  proclaimed  repentance,  a  judgment  day,  Jesus  as 
the  Judge  as  shown  by  his  Resurrection,  great  fundamental 
doctrines,  and  doubtless  had  much  more  to  say  when  they 
interrupted  his  address.  There  is  no  room  here  for  such  a 
charge  against  Paul.  He  rose  to  a  great  occasion  and  made 
a  masterful  exposition  of  God's  place  and  power  in  human 
history.  Whereof  he  hath  given  assurance  {pistin  paraschon). 
Second  aorist  active  participle  of  parecho,  old  verb  to  furnish, 
used  regularly  by  Demosthenes  for  bringing  forward  ev- 
idence. Note  this  old  use  of  pistis  as  conviction  or  ground 
of  confidence  (Heb.  ii:i)  like  a  note  or  title-deed,  a  convic- 
tion resting  on  solid  basis  of  fact.  All  the  other  uses  of  pistis 
grow  out  of  this  one  from  peitho,  to  persuade.  In  that  he  hath 
raised  him  from  the  dead  {anastesas  auton  ek  nekron).  First 
aorist  active  participle  of  anistemij  causal  participle,  but 
literally,  "having  raised  him  from  the  dead."  This  Paul 
knew  to  be  a  fact  because  he  himself  had  seen  the  Risen

Christ.  Paul  has  here  come  to  the  heart  of  his  message  and 
could  now  throw  light  on  their  misapprehension  about 
"Jesus  and  the  Resurrection"  (verse  i8).  Here  Paul  has 
given  the  proof  of  all  his  claims  in  the  address  that  seemed 
Knew  and  strange  to  them. 

32.  The  resurrection  of  the  dead  {anastasin  nekron).  Rather, 
"a  resurrection  of  dead  men."  No  article  with  either  word. 
The  Greeks  believed  that  the  souls  of  men  lived  on,  but 
they  had  no  conception  of  resurrection  of  the  body.  They 
had  listened  with  respect  till  Paul  spoke  of  the  actual  resur- 
rection of  Jesus  from  the  dead  as  a  fact,  when  they  did  not 
care  to  hear  more.  Some  mocked  {hoi  men  echleuazon).  Im- 
perfect active  of  chleuazo,  a  common  verb  (from  chleue, 
jesting,  mockery).  Only  here  in  the  N.T.  though  late  MSS. 
have  it  in  2:13  (best  MSS.  diachleuazo) .  Probably  inchoa- 
tive here,  began  to  mock.  In  contempt  at  Paul's  statement 
they  declined  to  listen  further  to  "this  babbler"  (verse  18) 
who  had  now  lost  what  he  had  gained  with  this  group  of 
hearers  (probably  the  light  and  flippant  Epicureans).  But 
others  {hoi  de).  A  more  polite  group  like  those  who  had  in- 
vited him  to  speak  (verse  19).  They  were  unconvinced, 
but  had  better  manners  and  so  were  in  favour  of  an  adjourn- 
ment. This  was  done,  though  it  is  not  clear  whether  it  was 
a  serious  postponement  or  a  courteous  refusal  to  hear  Paul 
further  (probably  this).  It  was  a  virtual  dismissal  of  the 
matter.  "It  is  a  sad  story — the  noblest  of  ancient  cities  and 
the  noblest  man  of  history — and  he  never  cared  to  look  on  it 
again"   (Furneaux). 

33.  Thus  Paul  went  out  from  among  them  {houtos  ho  Paulos 
exelthen  ek  mesou  auton).  No  further  questions,  no  effort 
to  arrest  him,  no  further  ridicule.  He_walked  out  never  ta 
return  to  Athens.    Had  he  failed.'' 

34.  Clave  unto  him  and  believed  ikollethentes  autbi  episteu- 
san).  First  aorist  passive  of  this  strong  word  koUad,  to  glue 
to,  common  in  Acts  (5:13;  8:29;  9:26;  10:28).   No  sermon  is  a

failure  which  leads  a  group  of  men  {andres)  to  believe  (in- 
gressive  aorist  of  pisteub)  in  Jesus  Christ.  Many  so-called 
great  or  grand  sermons  reap  no  such  harvest.  Dionysius  the 
Areopagite  {Dionusios  ho  Areopagites).  One  of  the  judges 
of  the  Court  of  the  Areopagus.  That  of  itself  was  no  small 
victory.  He  was  one  of  this  college  of  twelve  judges  who 
had  helped  to  make  Athens  famous.  Eusebius  says  that  he 
became  afterwards  bishop  of  the  Church  at  Athens  and 
died  a  martyr.  A  woman  named  Damaris  {gune  onomati 
Damans).  A  woman  by  name  Damaris.  Not  the  wife  of 
Dionysius  as  some  have  thought,  but  an  aristocratic  woman, 
not  necessarily  an  educated  courtezan  as  Furneaux  holds. 
And  there  were  "others"  (heteroi)  with  them,  a  group  strong 
enough  to  keep  the  fire  burning  in  Athens.  It  is  common 
to  say  that  Paul  in  I  Cor.  2:1-5  alludes  to  his  failure  with 
philosophy  in  Athens  when  he  failed  to  preach  Christ  cruci- 
fied and  he  determined  never  to  make  that  mistake  again. 
On  the  other  hand  Paul  determined  to  stick  to  the  Cross 
of  Christ  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  the  intellectual  pride  and 
superficial  culture  of  Athens  had  prevented  the  largest 
success.  As  he  faced  Corinth  with  its  veneer  of  culture  and 
imitation  of  philosophy  and  sudden  wealth  he  would  go  on 
with  the  same  gospel  of  the  Cross,  the  only  gospel  that 
Paul  knew  or  preached.  And  it  was  a  great  thing  to  give  the 
world  a  sermon  like  that  preached  in  Athens. 


CHAPTER  XVIII 

1,  To  Corinth  {eis  Korinthon).  Mummius  had  captured 
and  destroyed  Corinth  B.C.  146.  It  was  jestored  by  Julius 
Caesar  b.c.  46  as  a  boom  town  and  made  a  colony.  It  was 
now  the  capital  of  the  province  of  Achaia  and  the  chief 
commercial  city  of  Greece  with  a  cosmopolitan  population. 
It  was  only  fiftyL-saiks^ironL^thens.  The  summit  of  Acro- 
corinthus  was  1,800  feet  high  and  the  ports  of  Cenchreae  and 
Lechaeum  and  the  Isthmus  across  which  ships  were  hauled 
gave  it  command  of  the  trade  routes  between  Asia  and  Rome. 
The  temple  of  Aphrodite  on  the  Acrocorinthus  had  a  thou- 
sand consecrated  prostitutes  and  the  very  name  to  Corin- 
thianize  meant  immorality.  Not  the  Parthenon  with  Athene 
faced  Paul  in  Corinth,  but  a  worse  situation.  Naturally 
many  Jews  were  in  such  a  mart  of  trade.  Philippi,  Thessa- 
lonica,  Beroea,  Athens,  all  had  brought  anxiety  to  Paul. 
What  could  he  expect  in  licentious  Corinth.'' 

2.  Aquila  {Akulan).  Luke  calls  him  a  Jewfrom  Pontus, 
apparently  not^£t^a  disciple,  though  there  were  Jews  from 
Pontus  at  the  great  Pentecost  who  were  converted  (2:9). 
Aquila  who  made  the  famous  a.d.  translation  of  the  O.T. 
was  also  from  Pontus.  Paul  "found"  (heuron,  second  aorist 
active  participle  of  heuriskb)  though  we  do  not  know 
how.  Edersheim  says  that  a  Jewish  guild  always  kept  to- 
gether whether  in  street  or  synagogue  so  that  by  this  bond 
they  probably  met.  Lately  come  from  Italy  (prosphatos 
eleluthota  apo  tes  Italias).  Second  perfect  participle  of  erch- 
omai.  Koine  adverb,  here  only  in  the  N.T.,  from  adjective 
prosphatos  {pro,  sphao  or  sphazo,  to  kill),  lately  slaughtered 
and  so  fresh  or  recent  (Heb.  10:20).  With  his  wife  Priscilla 
{kai  Priskillan  gunaika  autou).   Diminutive  of  Priska  (Rom. 

294 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  295 

16:3;  I  Cor.  16:19).  Prisca  is  a  name  in  the  Acilian  family 
and  the  Prisci  was  the  name  of  another  noble  clan.  Aquila 
may  have  been  a  freedman  like  many  Jews  in  Rome.  Her 
name  comes  before  his  in  verses  ^8^^;  Roni^i6:3;  ILXim. 
4:9.  Because  Claudius  had  commanded  {dia  to  diatetachenai 
Klaudion).  Perfect  active  articular  infinitive  of  diatasso,  old 
verb  to  dispose,  arrange,  here  with  accusative  of  general 
reference.  Dia  here  is  causal  sense,  "because  of  the  having 
ordered  as  to  Claudius."  This  was  about  a.d.  49,  done, 
Suetonius  says  {Claudius  C.  25),  because  "the  Jews  were 
in  a  state  of  constant  tumult  at  the  instigation  of  one  Chces- 
tus"  (probably  among  the  Jews  about  Christ  so  pronounced). 
At  any  rate  Jews  were  unpopular  in  Rome  for  Tiberius  had 
deported  4,000  to  Sardinia.  There  were  20,000  Jews  in 
Rome.  Probably  mainly  those  implicated  in  the  riots  ac- 
tually left. 

3.  Because  he  was  of  the  same  trade  {dia  to  homotechnon 
einai).  Same  construction  with  dia  as  above.  Homotechnon 
is  an  old  word  {homos,  techne),  though  here  alone  in  N.T. 
Rabbi  Judah  says:  "He  that  teacheth  not  his  son  a  trade, 
doth  the  same  as  if  he  taught  him  to  be  a  thief,"  So  it  was 
easy  for  Paul  to  find  a  home  with  these  "tentmakers  by 
trade"  {skenoipoioi  tei  technei).  Late  word  from  skene  and 
poieoj  here  only  in  the  N.T.  They  made  portable  tents  of 
leather  or  of  cloth  of  goat's  hair.  So  Paul  lived  in  this  home 
with  this  noble  man  and  his  wife,  all  the  more  congenial  if 
already  Christians  which  they  soon  became  at  any  rate.  - 
They  worked  as  partners  in  the  common  trade.  Paul  worked 
for  his  support  elsewhere,  already  in  Thes^alonica  (I  Thess. 
2:9;  n  Thess.  3:8)  and  later  at  Ephesus  with  Aquila  and 
Priscilla  (Acts  18:18,  26;  20:34;  I  Cor.  16:19).  They  moved 
again  to  Rome  (Rom.  16:3)  and  were  evidently  a  couple  of 
considerable  wealth  and  generosity.  It  was  a  blessing  to 
Paul  to  find  himself  with  these  people.  So  he  "abode" 
{emenen,  imperfect  active)  with  them  and  "they  wrought" 


296      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

(ergazonto,  imperfect  middle),  happy  and  busy  during  week 
days. 

4.  He  reasoned  (dielegeto).  Imperfect  middle,  same  form  as 
in  17:17  about  Paul's  work  in  Athens,  here  only  on  the 
Sabbaths.  Persuaded  {epeithen).  Imperfect  active,  conative, 
he  tried  to  persuade  both  Jews  and  Greeks  (God-fearers  who 
alone  would  come). 

5.  Was  constrained  hy  the  wor^  {suneicheto  toi  logoi).  This 
is  undoubtedly  the  correct  text  and  not  tot  pneumati  of  the 
Textus  Receptus,  but  suneicheto  is  in  my  opinion  the  direct 
middle  imperfect  indicative,  not  the  imperfect  passive  as 
the  translations  have  it  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  808). 
Paul  held  himself  together  or  completely  to  the  preaching 
instead  of  just  on  Sabbaths  in  the  synagogue  (verse  4). 
The  coming  of  Silas  and  Timothy  with  the  gifts  from  Mace- 
donia fl  Thess.  3:6;  II  Cor.  11:9;  Phil.  4:15)  set  Paul 
free  from  tent-making  for  a  while  so  that  he_began  to  devote 
himself  (inchoative  imperfect)  with  fresh_consecration  to 
preaching.  See  the  active  in  II  Cor.  5:14.  He  was  now  also 
assisted  by  Silas  and  Timothy  (II  Cor.  1:19).  Testifying  to 
the  Jews  that  Jesus  was  the  Christ  (diamarturomenos  tois 
loudaiois  einai  ton  Christon  lesoun).  Paul's  witness  every- 
where (9:22;  17:3).  This  verb  diamarturomenos  occurs  in 
2:40  (which  see)  for  Peter's  earnest  witness.  Perhaps  daily 
now  in  the  synagogue  he  spoke  to  the  Jews  who  came.  Einai 
is  the  infinitive  in  indirect  discourse  (assertion)  with  the 
accusative  of  general  reference.  By  ton  Christon  Paul  means 
"the  Messiah."  His  witness  is  to  show  to  the  Jews  that 
Jesus  of  Nazareth  is  the  Messiah. 

6.  When  they  opposed  themselves  (antitassomenon  auton). 
Genitive  absolute  with  present  middle  (direct  middle  again) 
of  antitasso,  old  verb  to  range  in  battle  array  (tasso)  face 
to  face  with  or  against  (anti).  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and 
Rom.  13:2;  James  4:6;  I  Peter  5:5.  Paul's  fresh  activity 
roused  the  rabbis  as  at  Antioch  in  Pisidia  and  at  Thessalonica 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  297 

in  concerted  opposition  and  railing  (blasphemy).  He  shook 
out  his  raiment  {ektinaxamenos  ta  himatia).  First  aorist 
middle  of  ektinasso,  old  verb,  in  the  N.T.  only  here  as  in 
13:51  (middle)  and  Mark  6:11  =  Matt.  10:15  where  active 
voice  occurs  of  shaking  out  dust  also.  Vivid  and  dramatic 
picture  here  like  that  in  Neh.  5:13,  "undoubtedly  a  very 
exasperating  gesture"  (Ramsay),  but  Paul  was  deeply 
stirred.  Your  blood  be  upon  your  own  heads  {To  haima  humon 
epi  ten  kephalen  humon).  As  in  Ez'ek.  3:i8f.  and  33:4,  8f.; 
II  Sam.  1:16.  Not  as  a  curse,  but  "a  solemn  disclaimer  of 
responsibility"  by  Paul  (Page)  as  in  Acts  20:26.  The  Jews 
used  this  very  phrase  in  assuming  responsibility  for  the 
blood  of  Jesus  (Matt.  27:25).  Cf.  Matt.  23:35.  /  am  clean 
{katharos  ego).  Pure  from  your  blood.  Repeats  the  claim 
made  in  previous  sentence.  Paul_had-jio_ne-bis-^uty.  From 
henceforth  {apo  tou  nun).  Turning  point  reached  in  Corinth. 
He  will  devote,  himself  to  the  Gentiles,  though  Jews  will 
be  converted  there  also.  Elsewhere  as  in  Ephesus  (19:1-10) 
and  in  Rome  (Acts  28:23-28)  Paul  will  preach  also  to  Jews. 
7.  Titus  Justus  {Titou  loustou).  So  Aleph  E  Vulgate, 
while  B  has  Titiau  loustou^  while  most  MSS.  have  only 
loustou.  Evidently  a  Roman  citizen  and  not  Titus,  brother 
of  Luke,  of  Gal.  2:1.  We  had  Barsabbas  Justus  (Acts  1:23) 
and  Paul  speaks  of  Jesus  Justus  (Col.  4:11).  The  Titii  were 
a  famous  family_of_g9tters  in  Corinth.  This  Roman  was  a 
God-fearer  whose  house  "joined  hard  to  the  synagogue" 
{en  sunomorousa  tei  sunagogei).  Periphrastic  imperfect  active 
of  sunomoreo,  a  late  (Byzantine)  word,  here  only  in  the  N.T., 
followed  by  the  associative  instrumental  case,  from  suno- 
moros  {sun,  homoros  from  homos,  joint,  and  horos,  boundary) 
having  joint  boundaries,  right  next  to.  Whether  Paul 
chose  this  location  for  his  work  because  it  was  next  to  the 
synagogue,  we  do  not  know,  but  it  caught  the  attendants  at 
the  synagogue  worship.  In  Ephesus  when  Paul  had  to  leave 
the  synagogue  he  went  to  the  school  house  of  Tyrannus

(i9:9f.).  The  lines  are  being  drawn  between  the  Christians 
and  the  Jews,  drawn  by  the  Jews  themselves. 

8.  Crispus  (Krispos).  Though  a  Jew  and  ruler  of  the 
synagogue  (cf.  13:15),  he  had  a  Latin  name.  Paul  baptized 
him  (I  Cor.  i  :I4)  himself,  perhaps  because  oniis_prorninence,  ^ 
apparently  letting  Silas  and  Timothy  baptize  niost  of  the 
converts  (I  Cor.  1:14-17).  Probably  he  followed  Paul  to 
the  house  of  Titus  Justus.  It  looked  like  ruin  for  the  syna- 
gogue. IVith  all  his  house  (sun  holoi  toi  oikbi  autou).  Another 
household  conversion,  for  Crispus  "believed  (episteusen)  in 
the  Lord  with  all  his  house."  Hearvng  believed  and  were 
baptized  [akouontes  episteuon  kai  ebaptizonto).  Present  active 
participle  and  imperfect  indicatives  active  and  passive,  ex- 
pressing repetition  for  the  "many"  others  who  kept  coming 

to  the  Lord  in  Corinth.  It  was  a  continual  revival  after  Silas 
and  Timothy  came  and  a  great  chuTch  was  gathered  here 
during  the  nearly  two  years  that  Paul  laboured  in  Corinth 
(possibly  A.D.  51  and  52). 

9.  Be  not  afraid,  but  speak,  and  hold  not  thy  peace  {Me 
phobou,  alia  lalei  kai  me  siopeseis).  Literally,  "stop  being 
afraid  {me  with  present  middle  imperative  of  phobeo),  but 

^o  on  speaking  (present  active  imperative  of  laleo)  and  do 
not  become  silent  (me  and  first  aorist  active  of  siopad,  in- 
gressive  aorist)."  Evidently  there  weresiggsjof  a  gathering 
storm  before  this  vision  and  message  from  the  Lord  Jesus 
came  to  Paul  one  night.  Paul  knew  only  too  well  what 
Jewish  hatred  could  do  as  he  had  learned  it  at  Damascus, 
Jerusalem,  Antioch  in  Pisidia,  Iconium,  Lystra,  Derbe, 
Thcssalonica,  Bcroea.  He  had  clearly  moments  of  doubt 
whether  he  had  not  better  move  on  or  become  silent  for  a 
while  in  Corinth.  Every  pastor  knows  what  it  is  to  have  such 
moods  and  moments.  In  II  Thess.  3:2  (written  at  this  time) 
we  catch  Paul's  dejection  of  spirits.  He  was  like  Elijah 
(I  Kings  19:4)  and  Jeremiah  (Jer.  i5:i5fT.). 

10.  BiTausf  I  am  with  thee  idiots  ego  cimi  meta  sou).    Jesus 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  299 

had  given  this  promise  to  all  believers  (Matt.  28:20)  and  here 
he  renews  it  to  Paul.  This  promise  changes  Paul's  whole 
outlook.  Jesus  had  spoken  to  Paul  before,  on  the  way  to 
Damascus  (9:4),  in  Jerusalem  (22:i7f.),  in  Troas  (16:9), 
in  great  crises  of  his  life.  He  will  hear  him  again  (25:11; 
27:23).  Paul  knows  the  voice  of  Jesus.  N^o  man  shall  set 
on  thee  to  harm  thee  (oudeis  epithesetai  soi  tou  kakosai  se). 
Future  direct  middle  indicative  of  epitithemi,  old  and  com- 
mon verb,  here  in  direct  middle  to  lay  or  throw  oneself  upon, 
.loattack.  Jesus  kept  that  promise  in  Corinth  for  Paul.  Tou, 
kakosai  is  genitive  articular  infinitive  of  purpose  of  kakoo,  to 
do  harm  to.  Paul  would  now  face  all  the  rabbis  without 
fear.  /  have  much  people  {laos  estin  moi  polus).  Dative  of 
personal  interest.  "There  is  to  me  much  people,'^  not  yet 
saved,  but  who  will  be  if  Paul  holds  on.  There  is  the  problem 
for  every  preacher  and  pastor,  how  to  win  the  elect  to  Christ. 

11.  y^  year  and  six  months  {eniauton  kai  menas  hex). 
Accusative  of  extent  of  time.  How  much  time  before  this 
incident  he  had  been  there  we  do  not  know.  He  was  in 
Corinth  probably  a  couple  of  years  in  all.  His  work  extended 
beyond  the  city  (H  Cor.  11:10)  and  there  was  a  church  in 
Cenchreae  (Rom.  16:1). 

12.  When  Gallio  was  proconsul  of  Achaia  {Gallionos  de 
anthupatou  onios  tes  Achaias).  Genitive  absolute  of  present 
participle  ontos.  Brother  of  Seneca  the  Stoic  (Nero's  tutor) 
and  uncle  of  Lucan  the  author  of  the  Pharsalia.  His  original 
name  was  M.  Annaeus  Novatus  till  he  was  adopted  by  Gallio 
the  rhetorician.  The  family  was  Spanish.  Gallio  was  a  man 
of  culture  and  refinement  and  may  have  been  chosen  pro- 
consul of  Achaia  for  this  reason.  Statius  calls  him  ^'dulcis 
Gallio."  Seneca  says  of  him:  Nemo  enim  mortalium  uni  tarn 
dulcis  quam  hie  omnibus  (No  one  of  mortals  is  so  pleasant 
to  one  person  as  he  is  to  all).  Luke  alone  among  writers  says 
that  he  was  proconsul,  but  Seneca  speaks  of  his  being  in 
Achaia  where  he  caught  fever,  a   coi  roboration  of  Luke. 


300      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

But  now  a  whitish  grey  limestone  inscription  from  the 
Hagios  Elias  quarries  near  Delphi  (a  letter  of  Claudius  to 
Delphi)  has  been  found  which  definitely  names  Gallio  as  pro- 
consul of  Achaia  (authupatos  Us  Achaias).  The  province  of 
Achaia  after  various  shifts  (first  senatorial,  then  imperial) 
back  and  forth  with  Macedonia,  in  a.d.  44  Claudius  gave 
back  to  the  Senate  with  proconsul  as  the  title  of  the  governor. 
It  is  amazing  how  Luke  is  confirmed  whenever  a  new  dis- 
covery is  made.  The  discovery  of  this  inscription  has  thrown 
light  also  on  the  date  of  Paul's  work  in  Corinth  as  it  says 
that  Gallio  came  in  the  26th  acclamation  of  Claudius  as 
Emperor  in  a.d.  51,  that  would  definitely  fix  the  time  of 
Paul  in  Corinth  as  a.d.  50  and  51  (or  51  and  52).  Deiss- 
mann  has  a  full  and  able  discussion  of  the  whole  matter  in 
Appendix  I  to  his  St.  Paul.  -Rose  up  {katepestesan).  Second 
aorist  active  of  kat-eph-istemi,  intransitive,  to  take  a  stand 
against,  a  double  compound  verb  found  nowliere  else.  They 
took  a  stand  (estesan)  against  {kata,  down  on,  epi,  upon), 
they  made  a  dash  or  rush  at  Paul  as  if  they  would  stand  it 
no  longer.  Before  the  judgment  seat  {epi  to  bema).  See  on 
12:21.  The  proconsul  was  sitting  in  the  basilica  in  the  forum 
or  agora.  The  Jews  had  probably  heard  of  his  reputation 
for  moderation  and  sought  to  make  an  impression  as  they 
had  on  the  praetors  of  Philippi  by  their  rush  (sunepeste, 
16:22).  The  new  proconsul  was  a  good  chance  also  (25:2). 
So  for  the  second  time  Paul  faces  a  Roman  proconsul  (Sergius 
Paulus,  13:7)  though  under  very  different  circumstances. 
13.  Contrary  to  the  lazv  {para  ton  nomon).  They  did  not 
accuse  Paul  of  treason  as  in  Thessalonica,  perhaps  Paul 
had  been  more  careful  in  his  language  here.  They  bring 
the  same  charge  here  that  the  owners  of  the  slave-girl  brought 
in  Philippi  (16:21).  Perhaps  they  fear  to  go  too  far  with 
Gallio,  for  they  are  dealing  with  a  Roman  proconsul,  not 
with  the  politarchs  of  Thessalonica.  The  Jewish  religion  was 
a  religio  licita  and  they  were  allowed  to  make  proselytes, 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  301 

but  not  among  Roman  citizens.  To  prove  that  Paul  was 
acting  contrary  to  Roman  law  (for  Jewish  law  had  no  stand- 
ing with  Gallio  though  the  phrase  has  a  double  meaning) 
these  Jews  had  to  show  that  Paul  was  making  converts  in 
ways  that  violated  the  Roman  regulations  on  that  subject. 
The  accusation  as  made  did  not  show  it  nor  did  they  pro- 
duce any  evidence  to  do  it.  The  verb  used  anapeithei  means 
to  stir  up  by  persuasion  (old  verb  here  only  in  the  N.T.), 
a  thing  that  he  had  a  right  to  do. 

14.  When  Paul  was  about  to  open  his  mouth  {mellontos  tou 
Paulou  anoigein  to  stoma).    Genitive  absolute  again.  ^Before 

*aul  could  speak,  Gallio  cut  in  and  ended  the  whole  matter. 
Accord  ingto~their  own  statement  Paul  needed  no  defence. 
Wrong  (adikema).  Injuria.  Old  word,  a  wrong  done  one. 
In  N.T.  only  here,  Acts  24:20;  Rev.  18:5.  Here  it  may 
mean  a  legal  wrong  to  the  state.  Wicked  villainy  (rhdidiour- 
gema).  A  crime,  act  of  a  criminal,  from  rhdidiour gos  {rhdidios, 
easy,  ergon,  work),  one  who  does  a  thing  with  ease,  adroitly,  a 
"slick  citizen."  Reason  would  that  I  should  hear  with  you 
{kata  logon  an  aneschomen  humon).  Literally,  "according  to 
reason  I  should  have  put  up  with  you  (or  held  myself  back 
from  you)."  This  condition  is  the  second  class  (determined 
as  unfulfilled)  and  means  that  the_j£ws_had_jKL.case  against 
Paul  in  a  Roman  court.  The  verb  in  the  conclusion  {anes- 
chomen) is  second  aorist  middle  indicative  and  means  with 
the  ablative  humon  "I  should  have  held  myself  back  (direct 
middle)  from  you  (ablative).  The  use  of  an  makes  the  form 
of  the  condition  plain. 

15.  Questions  {zetemata).  Plural,  contemptuous,  "a 
parcel  of  questions"  (Knowling).  About  words  {peri  logon). 
Word,  singular,  talk,  not  deed  or  fact  {ergon,  factum).  Ayid 
names  {kai  onomaton).  As  to  whether  "Jesus"  should  also 
be  called  "Christ"  or  "Messiah."  The  Jews,  Gallio  knew, 
split  hairs  over  words  and  names.  And  your  own  law  {kai 
nomou  tou  kath'  humds).   Literally,  "And  law  that  according 


302      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

to  you."  Gallio  had  not  been  caught  in  the  trap  set  for  him. 
What  they  had  said  concerned  Jewish  law,  not  Roman  law 
at  all.  Look  to  it  yourselves  {opsesthe  autoi).  The  volitive 
future  middle  indicative  of  horao  often  used  (cf.  Matt.  27:4) 
where  an  imperative  could  be  employed  (Robertson,  Gram- 
mar ^  p.  874).  The  use  of  autoi  (yourselves)  turns  it  all  over 
to  them.  /  am  not  minded  {ou  boulomai).  I  am  not  willing,  I 
do  not  wish.  An  absolute  refusal  to  allow  a  religious  question 
to  be  brought  before  a  Roman  civil  court.  This  decision  of 
Gallio  does  not  establish  Christianity  in  preference  to 
Judaism.  It  simply  means  that  the  case  was  plainly  that 
Christianity  was  a  form  of  Judaism  and  as  such  was  not 
opposed  to  Roman  law.  This  decision  opened  the  door  for 
Paul's  preaching  all  over  the  Roman  Empire.  Later  Paul 
himself  argues  (Rom.  9  to  11)  that  in  fact  Christianity  is 
the  true,  the  spiritual  Judaism. 

16.  lie  drave  them  {apelasen  autous).  First  aorist  active 
indicative  of  apelauno,  old  word,  but  here  alone  in  the  N.T. 
The  Jews  were  stunned  by  this  sudden  blow  from  the  mild 
proconsul  and  wanted  to  linger  to  argue  the  case  further, 
but  they  had  to  go. 

17.  They  all  laid  hold  on  Sosthenes  {epilabomenoi  pantes 
S  OS  then  en).  See  16:19;  17:19  for  the  same  form.  Here  is 
violent  hostile  reaction  against  their  leader  who  had  failed  so 
miserably.  Beat  him  {etupto7j).  Inchoative  imperfect  active, 
began  to  beat  him,  even  if  they  could  not  beat  Paul.  Sos- 
thenes succeeded  Crispus  (verse  8)  when  he  went  over  to 
Paul.  The  beating  did  Soslhenes  good  for  he  too  finally  is  a 
Christian  (I  Cor.  i:i),  a  co-worker  with  Paul  whom  he  had 
sought  to  persecute.  Jnd  Gallio  cared  for  none  of  these  things 
{kai  ouden  touton  toi  Gallioni  emelen).  Literally,  "no  one  of 
these  things  was  a  care  to  Gallio."  The  usually  impersonal 
verb  (melei,  emelen,  imperfect  active)  here  has  the  nominative 
as  in  Luke  10:40.  These  words  have  been  often  misunder- 
stood as  a  description  of  Gallic's  lack  of  interest  in  Christian- 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  303 

ity,  a  religious  indifferentist.  But  that  is  quite  beside  the 
mark.  Gallic  looked  the  other  way  with  a  blind  eye  while 
Sosthenes  got  the  beating  which  he  richly  deserved.  That 
was  a  small  detail  for  the  police  court,  not  for  the  proconsul's 
concern.  Gallio  shows  up  well  in  Luke's  narrative  as  a  clear 
headed  judge  who  would  not  be  led  astray  by  Jewish  sub- 
terfuges and  with  the  courage  to  dismiss  a  mob. 

18.  Having  tarried  after  this  yet  many  days  {eti  prosmeinas 
hemeras  hikanas).  First  aorist  (constative)  active  participle 
of  prosmeno,  old  verb,  to  remain  besides  (pros  as  in  I  Tim. 
1:3)  and  that  idea  is  expressed  also  in  eti  (yet).  The  accusa- 
tive is  extent  of  time.  On  Luke's  frequent  use  of  hikanos 
see  8:11.  It  is  not  certain  that  this  period  of  "considerable 
days"  which  followed  the  trial  before  Gallio  is  included  in 
the  year  and  six  months  of  verse  11  or  is  in  addition  to  it 
which  is  most  likely.  Vindicated  as  Paul  was,  there  was  no 
reason  for  haste  in  leaving,  though  he  usually  left  after  such 
a  crisis  was  passed.  7*00^  his  leave  {apotaxamenos).  First 
aorist  middle  (direct),  old  verb,  to  separate  oneself,  to  bid 
farewell  (Vulgate  valefacio),  as  in  verse  21  and  Mark  6:46. 
Sailed  thence  (exeplei).  Imperfect  active  of  ekpleo,  old  and 
common  verb,  inchoative  imperfect,  started  to  sail.  Only 
Priscilla  and  Aquila  are  mentioned  as  his  companions  though 
others  may  have  been  in  the  party.  Having  shorn  his  head 
(keiramenos  ten  kephalen).  First  aorist  middle  (causative) 
of  keiro^  old  verb  to  shear  (sheep)  and  the  hair  as  also  in 
I  Cor.  1 1 :6.  The  participle  is  masculine  and  so  cannot  r^er 
to  Priscilla.  Aquila  comes  next  to  the  participle,  but  since 
mention  of  Priscilla  and  Aquila  is  parenthetical  and  the  two 
other  participles  (prosmeinaSy  apotaxamenos)  refer  to  Paul 
it  seems  clear  that  this  one  does  also.  For  he  had  a  vow 
{eichen  gar  euchen).  Imperfect  active  showing  the  continu- 
ance of  the  vow  up  till  this  time  in  Cenchreae,  the  port  of 
Corinth  when  it  expired.  It  was  not  a  Nazarite  vow  which 
could  be  absolved  only  in  Jerusalem.   It  is  possible  that  the

hair  was  only  polled  or  trimmed,  cut  shorter,  not  "shaved" 
{xurao  as  in  21  '.24)  for  there  Is  a  distinction  as  both  verbs  are 
contrasted  in  I  Cor.  11:6  {keirdsthai  e  xurdsthai).  It  is  not 
clear  what  sort  of  a  vow  Paul  had  taken  nor  why  he  took  it. 
It  may  have  been  a  thank  offering  for  the  outcome  at  Corinth 
(Hackett).  Paul  as  a  Jew  kept  up  his  observance  of  the 
ceremonial  law,  but  refused  to  impose  it  on  the  Gentiles. 

19.  Came  {katentesan).  Came  down,  as  usual  in  speaking 
of  coming  to  land  (16:1).  To  Ephesus  (eis  Epheson).  This 
great  city  on  the  Cayster,  the  capital  of  the  Province  of 
Asia,  the  home  of  the  worship  of  Diana  (Artemis)  with  a 
wonderful  temple,  Paul  at  last  had  reached,  though  forbidden 
to  come  on  the  way  out  on  this  tour  (16:6).  Here  Paul  will 
spend  three  years  after  his  return  from  Jerusalem.  He  left 
them  there  {kakeinous  katelipen  autou).  That  is,  Priscilla  and 
Aquila  he  left  (second  aorist  active  indicative)  here  {autou). 
But  Luke  mentions  the  departure  by  way  of  anticipation 
before  he  actually  went  away  (verse  21).  But  he  himself  {au- 
tos  de).  Paul  again  the  leading  person  in  the  narrative.  On 
this  occasion  he  may  have  gone  alone  into  the  synagogue.  He 
reasoned  (dielexato).  Luke's  favourite  word  for  Paul's  syna- 
gogue discourses  (17:2,  17;  18:4  which  see)  as  also  19:8,  9. 

20.  fVhen  they  asked  him  {erbtdnton  auton).  Genitive 
absolute  of  present  participle  of  erotady  old  verb  to  ask  a 
question,  common  in  Koine  to  make  a  request  as  here.  He 
consented  not  (ouk  epeneusen).  First  aorist  active  indicative 
of  epineud,  old  verb  to  express  approval  by  a  nod,  only  here 
in  the  N.T. 

21.  I  shall  return  {anakampso).  Future  active  indicative  of 
anakamptOj  old  verb  to  bend  back,  turn  back  (Matt.  2:2). 
//  God  will  {tou  theou  thelontos).  Genitive  absolute  of  present 
active  participle.  This  expression  {ean  with  subjunctive) 
occurs  also  in  I  Cor.  4:19;  16:7;  James  4:15.  Such  phrases 
were  common  among  Jews,  Greeks,  and  Romans,  and  are 
today.   It  is  simply  a  recognition  that  we  are  in  God's  hands. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  305 

The  Textus  Receptus  has  here  a  sentence  not  in  the  best 
MSB.:  "I  must  by  all  means  keep  this  feast  that  cometh  in 
Jerusalem."  This  addition  by  D  and  other  documents  may- 
have  been  due  to  a  desire  to  give  a  reason  for  the  language 
in  verse  22  about  "going  up"  to  Jerusalem.  Whether 
Paul  said  it  or  not,  it  was  in  the  spring  when  he  made  this 
journey  with  a  company  of  pilgrims  probably  going  to  the 
feast  of  Pentecost  in  Jerusalem.  We  know  that  later  Paul 
did  try  to  reach  Jerusalem  for  Pentecost  (20:16)  and  suc- 
ceeded. As  the  ship  was  leaving,  Paul  had  to  go,  but  with 
the  hope  of  returning  soon  to  Ephesus  as  he  did. 

22.  He  went  up  and  saluted  the  church  {anabas  kai  aspasame- 
nos  ten  ekklesian).  The  language  could  refer  to  the  church  in 
Caesarea  where  Paul  had  just  landed,  except  for  several 
things.  The  going  up  {anabas,  second  aorist  active  participle 
of  anabaino)  is  the  common  way  of  speaking  of  going  to 
Jerusalem  which  was  up  from  every  direction  save  from 
Hebron.  It  was  the  capital  of  Palestine  as  people  in  England 
today  speaking  of  going  up  to  London.  Besides  "he  went 
down  to  Antioch"  (katebe  eis  Jntiocheian,  second  aorist 
active  indicative  of  katabainb)  which  language  suits  better 
leaving  Jerusalem  than  Caesarea.  Moreover,  there  was  no 
special  reason  for  this  trip  to  Caesarea,  but  to  Jerusalem  it 
was  different.  Here  Paul  saluted  the  church  in  the  fourth 
of  his  five  visits  after  his  conversion  (9:26;  11:30;  15:4; 
18:22;  21:17).  The  apostles  may  or  may  not  have  been  in 
the  city,  but  Paul  had  friends  in  Jerusalem  now.  Apparently 
he  did  not  tarry  long,  but  returned  to  Antioch  to  make  a 
report  of  his  second  mission  tour  as  he  had  done  at  the 
close  of  the  first  when  he  and  Barnabas  came  back  (14:26- 
28).  He  had  started  on  this  tour  with  Silas  and  had  picked 
up  Timothy  and  Luke,  but  came  back  alone.  He  had  a 
great  story  to  tell. 

23.  Having  spent  some  time  (poiesas  chronon  tina).  Liter- 
ally, having  done  some  time.    How  long  we  do  not  know, 


3o6     WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

probably  not  long.  There  are  those  who  place  the  visit  of 
Peter  here  to  which  Paul  alludes  in  Gal.  2:1  iff.  and  which 
we  have  located  while  Paul  was  here  the  last  time  (Acts 
15:35).  He  departed  {exelthen).  Thus  simply  and  alone 
Paul  began  the  third  mission  tour  without  a  Barnabas  or  a 
Silas.  Went  through  {dierchomenos).  Present  middle  parti- 
ciple, going  through.  The  region  of  Galatia  and  Phrygia  {ten 
Galatiken  choran  kai  Phrygian).  See  on  Acts  16:6  for  discus- 
sion of  this  phrase,  here  in  reverse  order,  passing  through  the 
Galatic  region  and  then  Phrygia.  Does  Luke  mean  Lyca- 
onia  (Derbe  and  Lystra)  and  Phrygia  (Iconium  and  Pisidian 
Antioch)  ?  Or  does  he  mean  the  route  west  through  the  old 
Galatia  and  the  old  Phrygia  on  west  into  Asia  ."*  The  same  con- 
flict exists  here  over  the  South  Galatian  and  the  North 
Galatian  theories.  Phrygia  is  apparently  distinguished  from 
the  Galatic  region  here.  It  is  apparently  a.d.  52  when  Paul 
set  out  on  this  tour.  In  order  ikathexes).  In  succession  as  in 
114,  though  the  names  of  the  cities  are  not  given.  Stahlish' 
ing  (sterizon).  As  he  did  in  the  second  tour  (15  41,  episteri- 
ton,  compound  of  this  same  verb)  which  see. 

24.  Apollos  {Apollds).  Genitive -0  Attic  second  declension. 
Probably  a  contraction  of  Apollonios  as  D  has  it  here.  An 
Alexandrian  {Alexandreus) .  Alexander  the  Great  founded 
this  city  B.C.  332  and  placed  a  colony  of  Jews  there  which 
flourished  greatly,  one-third  of  the  population  at  this  time. 
There  was  a  great  university  and  library  there.  The  Jewish- 
Alexandrian  philosophy  developed  here  of  which  Philo  was 
the  chief  exponent  who  was  still  living.  Apollos  was  un- 
doubtedly a  man  of  the  schools  and  a  man  of  parts.  A 
learned  man  {aner  logios).  Or  eloquent,  as  the  word  can 
mean  either  a  man  of  words  (like  one  "wordy,"  verbose) 
or  a  man  of  ideas,  since  logos  Avas  used  either  for  reason  or 
speech.  Apollos  was  doubtless  both  learned  (mighty  in  the 
Scriptures)  and  eloquent,  though  eloquence  varies  greatly 
in  people's  ideas.    Mighty  in  the  Scriptures  (dunatos  on  en 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  307 

tats  graphais).  Being  powerful  (dunatos  verbal  of  dunamai 
and  same  root  as  dunamis,  dynamite,  dynamo)  in  the  Scrip- 
tures (in  the^owledge  and  _die,_us^^  as 
should  be  true  of  every  preacher.  There  is  no  excuse  for  ig- 
norance of  the  Scriptures  on  the  part  of  preachers,  the  pro- 
fessed interpreters  of  the  word  of  God.  The  last  lecture 
made  to  the  New  Testament  English  class  in  Southern 
Baptist  Theological  Seminary  by  John  A.  Broadus  was  on 
this  passage  with  a  plea  for  his  students  to  be  mighty  in  the 
Scriptures.  In  Alexandria  Clement  of  Alexandria  and  Origen 
taught  in  the  Christian  theological  school. 

25.  Had  been  instructed  in  the  way  of  the  Lord  {en  kateche- 
menos  ten  hodon  tou  kuriou).  Periphrastic  past  perfect  passive 
of  katecheOf  rare  in  the  old  Greek  and  not  in  the  LXX  from 
kata  and  echeo  {echo,  sound)  as  in  Luke  1 4,  to  re-sound,  to 
re-echo,  to  teach  by  repeated  dinning  into  the  ears  as  the 
Arabs  do  now,  to  teach  orally  by  word  of  mouth  (and  ear). 
Here  the  accusative  of  the  thing  (the  word)  is  retained  in 
the  passive  like  with  didasko,  to  teach  (Robertson,  Grammar, 
p.  485).  Being  fervent  in  spirit  {ze on  toi  pneumati).  Boiling 
(from  zed,  to  boil,  old  and  common  verb,  in  N.T.  only  here 
and  Rom.  12:11)  like  boiling  water  or  yeast.  The  Latin 
verb  ferveo  means  to  boil  or  ferment.  Locative  case  after  it. 
Taught  carefully  {edidasken  akribos).  Imperfect  active,  was 
teaching  or  inchoative,  began  teaching,  accurately.  He 
taught  accurately  what  he  knew,  a  fine  gift  for  any  preacher. 
Only  the  baptism  of  John  {monon  to  baptisma  loanou).  It  was 
a  baptism  of  repentance  (marked  by  repentance)  as  Paul  said 
(13:24;  19*4),  as  Peter  said  (2:38)  and  as  the  Gospels  tell 
(Mark  i  :4,  etc.).  That  is  to  say,  ApoUos  knew  only  what  the 
Baptist  knew  when  he  died,  but  John  had  preached  the  com- 
ing of  the  Messiah,  had  baptized  him,  had  identified  him  as 
the  Son  of  God,  had  proclaimed  the  baptism  of  the  Holy 
Spirit,  but  had  not  seen  the  Cross,  the  Resurrection  of  Jesus, 
nor  the  great  Day  of  Pentecost. 


3o8      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

26.  They  took  him  unto  them  (proselabonto) .  Second  aorist 
middle  (indirect)  indicative  of  proslambano,  old  verb,  to 
their  home  and  heart  as  companion  (cf.  the  rabbis  and  the 
ruffians  in  17:5).  Probably  for  dinner  after  service.  Ex- 
pounded (exethento).  Second  aorist  (effective)  middle  indica- 
tive of  ektithemi  seen  already  in  11:4,  to  set  forth.  More 
carefully  (akribesteron) .  Comparative  adverb  of  akribos. 
More  accurately  than  he  already  knew.  Instead  of  abusing 
the  young  and  brilliant  preacher  for  his  ignorance  they 
(particularly  Priscilla)  gave  him  the  fuller  story  of  the  life 
and  work  of  Jesus  and  of  the  apostolic  period  to  fill  up  the 
gaps  in  his  knowledge.   It  is  a  needed  and  delicate  task,  this 

-sy/  thing  of  teaching  gifted  young  ministers.  They  do  not  learn 
it  all  in  schools.  More  of  it  comes  from  contact  with  men 
and  women  rich  in  grace  and  in  the  knowledge  of  God's  ways. 
He  was  not  rebaptized,  but  only  received  fuller  information. 

27.  Encouraged  him  (protrepsamenoi).  First  aorist  middle 
participle  of  protrepo,  old  verb,  to  urge  forward,  to  push  on, 
only  here  in  the  N.T.  Since  Apollos  wanted  {boulomenou 
autou,  genitive  absolute)  to  go  into  Achaia,  the  brethren 
(including  others  besides  Priscilla  and  Aquila)  wrote  {egrap- 
san)  a  letter  of  introduction  to  the  disciples  in  Corinth  to 
receive  him  {apodexasthai  auton),  a  nice  letter  of  recommen- 
dation and  a  sincere  one  also.  But  Paul  will  refer  to  this 
very  letter  later  (II  Cor.  3:1)  and  observe  that  he  himself 
needed  no  such  letter  of  commendation.  The  Codex  Bezae 
adds  here  that  certain  Corinthians  who  had  come  to  Ephesus 
heard  Apollos  and  begged  him  to  cross  over  with  them  to 
Corinth.  This  may  very  well  be  the  way  that  Apollos  was 
led  to  go.  Preachers  often  receive  calls  because  visitors  from 
other  places  hear  them.  Priscilla  and  Aquila  were  well 
known  in  Corinth  and  their  approval  would  carry  weight. 
But  they  did  not  urge  Apollos  to  stay  longer  in  Ephesus. 
Helped  them  much  (sunebaleto  polu).  Second  aorist  middle  in- 
dicative of  sunballo  used  in  17:18  for  "dispute,"  old  verb  to 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  309 

throw  together,  in  the  N.T.  always  in  the  active  save  here 
in  the  middle  (common  in  Greek  writers)  to  put -together, 
to  help.  Through  grace  {dia  tes  charitos).  This  makes  sense 
if  taken  with  "believed,"  as  Hackett  does  (cf.  13:48;  16:14) 
or  with  "helped"  (I  Cor.  3:10;  15:10;  11  Cor.  1:12).  Both 
are  true  as  the  references  show. 

28.  Powerfully  (eutonos).  Adverb  from  eutonos  (eu,  well, 
teino,  to  stretch),  well-strung,  at  full  stretch.  Confuted  {dia- 
katelegcheto).  Imperfect  middle  of  the  double  compound 
verb  dia-kat-elegchomai,  to  confute  with  rivalry  in  a  contest, 
here  alone.  The  old  Greek  has  dielegcho,  to  convict  of  false- 
hood, but  not  this  double  compound  which  means  to  argue 
down  to  a  finish.  It  is  the  imperfect  tense  and  does  not 
mean  that  Apollos  convinced  these  rabbis,  but  he  had  the 
last  word.  Publicly  {demosidi).  See  5:18;  16:37.  In  open 
meeting  where  all  could  see  the  victory  of  Apollos.  Shewing 
(epideiknus).  Present  active  participle  of  epideiknumi,  old 
verb  to  set  forth  so  that  all  see.  By  the  Scriptures  {dia  ton 
graphon).  In  which  Apollos  was  so  "mighty"  (verse  24) 
and  the  rabbis  so  weak  for  they  knew  the  oral  law  better 
than  the  written  (Mark  7:8-12).  That  Jesus  was  the  Christ 
{einai  ton  Christon  lesoun).  Infinitive  and  the  accusative 
in  indirect  assertion.  Apollos  proclaims  the  same  message 
that  Paul  did  everywhere  (17:3).  He  had  not  yet  met  Paul, 
but  he  had  been  instructed  by  Priscilla  and  Aquila.  He  is 
in  Corinth  building  on  the  foundation  laid  so  well  by  Paul 
(I  Cor.  3:4-17).  Luke  has  here  made  a  brief  digression  from 
the  story  of  Paul,  but  it  helps  us  understand  Paul  better. 
There  are  those  who  think  that  Apollos  wrote  Hebrews, 
a  guess  that  may  be  correct. 


CHAPTER   XIX 

I .  While  /^polios  was  at  Corinth  {en  tbi  ton  Apollo  einai  en 
Korinthoi).  Favourite  idiom  with  Luke,  en  with  the  locative 
of  the  articular  infinitive  and  the  accusative  of  general 
reference  (Luke  i:8;  2:27,  etc.).  Having  passed  through  the 
upper  country  {dielthonta  ta  anoterika  mere).  Second  aorist 
active  participle  of  dierchomai,  accusative  case  agreeing  with 
Paulon,  accusative  of  general  reference  with  the  infinitive 
elthein,  idiomatic  construction  with  egeneto.  The  word  for 
"upper"  {anoterika)  is  a  late  form  for  anotera  (Luke  14:10) 
and  occurs  in  Hippocrates  and  Galen.  It  refers  to  the  high- 
lands (cf.  Xenophon's  Anabasis)  and  means  that  Paul  did 
not  travel  the  usual  Roman  road  west  by  Colossae  and 
Laodicea  in  the  Lycus  Valley,  cities  that  he  did  not  visit 
(Col.  2:1).  Instead  he  took  the  more  direct  road  through  the 
Cayster  Valley  to  Ephesus.  Codex  Bezae  says  here  that 
Paul  wanted  to  go  back  to  Jerusalem,  but  that  the  Holy 
Spirit  bade  him  to  go  into  Asia  where  he  had  been  forbidden 
to  go  in  the  second  tour  (16:6).  Whether  the  upper  "parts" 
{mere)  here  points  to  North  Galatia  is  still  a  point  of  dis- 
pute among  scholars.  So  he  came  again  to  Ephesus  as  he  had 
promised  to  do  (18:21).  The  province  of  Asia  included  the 
western  part  of  Asia  Minor.  The  Romans  took  this  country 
B.C.  130.  Finally  the  name  was  extended  to  the  whole  con- 
tinent. It  was  a  jewel  in  the  Roman  empire  along  with 
Africa  and  was  a  senatorial  province.  It  was  full  of  great 
cities  like  Ephesus,  Smyrna,  Pergamum,  Thyatira,  Sardis, 
Philadelphia,  Laodicea  (the  seven  churches  of  Rev.  2  and  3), 
Colossae,  Hierapolis,  Apamea,  to  go  no  further.  Hellenism 
had  full  sway  here.  Ephesus  was  the  capital  and  chief 
city  and  was  a  richer  and  larger  city  than  Corinth.    It  was 

310 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  311 

located  at  the  entrance  to  the  valley  of  the  Maeander  to  the 
east.  Here  was  the  power  of  Rome  and  the  splendour  of 
Greek  culture  and  the  full  tide  of  oriental  superstition  and 
magic.  The  Temple  of  Artemis  was  one  of  the  seven  wonders 
of  the  world.  While  in  Ephesus  some  hold  that  Paul  at  this 
time  wrote  the  Epistle  to  the  Galatians  after  his  recent  visit 
there,  some  that  he  did  it  before  his  recent  visit  to  Jerusalem. 
But  it  is  still  possible  that  he  wrote  it  from  Corinth  just  be- 
fore writing  to  Rome,  a  point  to  discuss  later.  Certain  dis- 
ciples {tinas  mathetas).  Who  were  they  .^  Apollos  had  already 
gone  to  Corinth.  They  show  no  connection  with  Priscilla 
and  Aquila.  Luke  calls  them  "disciples"  or  "learners" 
(mathetas)  because  they  were  evidently  sincere  though 
crude  and  ignorant.  There  is  no  reason  at  all  for  connecting 
these  uninformed  disciples  of  the  Baptist  with  Apollos. 
They  were  floating  followers  of  the  Baptist  who  drifted  into 
Ephesus  and  whom  Paul  found.  Some  of  John's  disciples 
clung  to  him  till  his  death  (John  3:22-25;  Luke  7:19;  Matt. 
14:12).  Some  of  them  left  Palestine  without  the  further 
knowledge  of  Jesus  that  came  after  his  death  and  some  did 
not  even  know  that,  as  turned  out  to  be  the  case  with  the 
group  in  Ephesus. 

2.  Did  ye  receive  the  Holy  Spirit  when  ye  believed?  {ei 
pneuma  hagion  elahete  pisteus antes?).  This  use  of  ei  in  a  di- 
rect question  occurs  in  i  :6,  is  not  according  to  the  old  Greek 
idiom,  but  is  common  in  the  LXX  and  the  N.T.  as  in  Luke 
13:23  which  see  (Robertson,  Grammar^  p.  916).  Apparently 
Paul  was  suspicious  of  the  looks  or  conduct  of  these  professed 
disciples.  The  first  aorist  active  participle  pisteusantes  is 
simultaneous  with  the  second  aorist  active_indicative  elahete 
and  refers  to  the  same  event.  Nay^  we  did  not  so  much  as 
hear  whether  the  Holy  Spirit  was  {AlV  oude  ei  pneuma  hagion 
estin  ekousamen).  The  reply  of  these  ignorant  disciples  is 
amazing.  They  probably  refer  to  the  time  of  their  baptism 
and  mean  that,  when  baptized,  they  did  not  hear  whether 


312      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

(ei  in  indirect  question)  the  Holy  Spirit  was  (estin  retained  as 
in  John  7:39).  Plain  proof  that  they  knew  John's  message 
poorly. 

3.  Into  what  {eis  ti).  More  properly.  Unto  what  or  on  what 
basil. (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  592).  Clearly,  Paul  felt  they 
had  received  a  poor  baptism  with  no  knowledge  of  the  Holy 
Spirit.  John^s  baptism  (to  loanou  baptisma).  Last  mention 
of  John  the  Baptist  in  the  N.T.  They  had  been  dipped  in 
other  words,  but  they  had  not  grasped  the  significance  of 
the  ordinance. 

4.  With  the  baptism  of  repentance  {baptisma  metanoias). 
Cognate  accusative  with  ebaptisen  and  the  genitive  metanoias 
describing  the  baptism  as  inarked  by  (case  of  species  or 
genus),  not  as  conveying,  repentance  just  as  in  Mark  1:4 
and  that  was  the  work  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  But  John  preached 
also  the  baptism  of  the  Holy  Spirit  which  the  Messiah  was 
to  bring  (Mark  i-.yi.  =  Matt.  3:1  if.  =  Luke  3:16).  If  they 
did  not  know  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  they  had  missed  the  point 
of  John's  baptism.  That  they  should  believe  on  him  that 
should  come  after  him,  that  is  on  Jesus  {eis  ton  erchomenon 
met"  auton  hina  pisteusosin,  tout*  estin  eis,  ton  lesoun).  Note 
the  emphatic  prolepsis  of  eis  ton  erchomenon  meV  auton 
before  hina  pisteusosin  with  which  it  is  construed.  This 
is  John's  identical  phrase,  "the  one  coming  after  me"  as 
seen  in  Mark  1:7  =  Matt.  3:11  =  Luke  3:16  =  John  1:15. 
It  is  not  clear  that  these  "disciples"  believed  in  a  Messiah, 
least  of  all  in  Jesus.  They  were  wholly  unprepared  for  the 
baptism  of  John.  Paul  does  not  mean  to  say  that  John's 
baptism  was  inadequate,  but  he  simply  explains  what  John 
really  taught  and  so  what  his  baptism  signified. 

5.  The  7iame  of  the  Lord  Jesus  {to  onoma  ton  kuriou  lesou). 
Apollos  was  not  rebaptized.  The  twelve  apostles  were  not 
rebaptized.  Jesus  received  no  other  baptism  than  that  of 
John.  The  point  here  is  simply  that  these  twelve  men  were 
grossly  ignorant  of  the  meaning  of  John's  baptism  as  regards 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  313 

repentance,  the  Messiahship  of  Jesus,  the  Holy  Spirit. 
Hence  Paul  had  them  baptized,  not  so  much  again,  as  really 
baptized  this  time,  in  the  name  or  on  the  authority  of  the 
Lord  Jesus  as  he  had  himself  commanded  (Matt.  28:19) 
and  as  was  the  universal  apostolic  custom.  Proper  under- 
standing of  "Jesus"  involved  all  the  rest  including  the 
Trinity  (Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Spirit).  Luke  does  not  give 
a  formula,  but  simply  explains  that  now  these  men  had  a 
proper  object  of  faith  Qesus)  and  were  now  really  baptized. 
6.  When  Paul  had  laid  his  hands  upon  them  {epithentos 
autois  tou  Paulou  cheiras).  Genitive  absolute  of  second 
aorist  active  participle  of  epitithemi.  This  act  of  laying  on 
of  the  hands  was  done  in  Samaria  by  Peter  and  John  (8:16) 
and  in  Damascus  in  the  case  of  Paul  (9:17)  and  was  followed 
as  here  by  the  descent  of  the  Holy  Spirit  in  supernatural 
power.  They  spake  with  tongues  {elaloun  glossais).  Inchoa- 
tive imperfect,  began  to  speak  with  tongues  as  in  Jerusalem 
at  Pentecost  and  as  in  Caesarea  before  the  baptism.  Proph- 
esied (epropheteuon).  Inchoative  imperfect  again,  began  to 
prophesy.  The  speaking  with  tongues  and  prophesying  was 
external  and  indubitable  proof  that  the  Holy  Spirit  had 
come  on  these  twelve  uninformed  disciples  now  fully  won  to 
the  service  of  Jesus  as  Messiah.  But  this  baptism  in  water 
did  not  "convey"  the  Holy  Spirit  nor  forgiveness  of  sins. 
Paul  was  not  a  sacramentalist. 

8.  Spake  boldly  (eparresiazeto).  Imperfect  middle,  kept  on 
at  it  for  three  months.  Cf.  same  word  in  18:26.  Persuading 
(peithon).  Present  active  conative  participle  of  peitho, 
trying  to  persuade  (28:23).  Paul's  idea  of  the  Kingdom  of 
God  wag  tVip  rhnrrh  of  God  which  he  (Tesus.  God's  Son)  had 
purchased  with  his  own  blood  (Acts  ,20j28,  calling  Christ 
God).  Nowhere  else  had  Paul  apparently  been  able  to  speak 
so  long  in  the  synagogue  without  interruption  unless  it  was 
so  at  Corinth.    These  Jews  were  already  interested  (18:30). 

9.  But  zvhen  some  were  hardened  {hos  de  tines  esklerunonto). 


314      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Imperfect  passive  of  skleruno^  causative  like  hiphil  in  He- 
brew, tojnakejiard  (skleros)  ojirough  or  ha  rah  (Matt.  25:24). 
In  LXX  and  Hippocrates  and  Galen  (in  medical  writings). 
In  N.T.  only  here  and  Rom.  9:18  and  4  times  in  Heb.  (3:8, 
I3>  '5;  47»  8)  quoting  and  referring  to  Psa.  95:8  about  hard- 
ening the  heart  lijceagristle.  The  inevitable  reaction  against 
Paul  went  on  even  in  Ephesus  though  slowly.  Disobedient 
{epeithoun).  InvBgrfect  again,  showing  the  growing  disbelief 
and  disobedience  (apeithes)^  both  ideas  as  in  14:2;  17:5, 
first  refusal  to  hflieve  and  then  refusal  to  obev.  Both  skle- 
runo  and  apeithed  occur  together,  as  here,  in  Ecclus.  30:12. 
Speaking  evil  of  the  Way  {kakologountes  ten  hodon).  Late 
verb  from  kakologos  (speaker  of  evil)  for  the  old  kakos  lego. 
Already  in  Mark  7:10;  9:39;  Matt.  154.  Now  these  Jews 
are  aggressive  opponents  of  Paul  and  seek  to  injure  his 
influence  with  the  crowd.  Note  "the  Way"  as  in  9:2  for 
Christianity.  He  departed  from  them  {apostas  ap*  auton). 
Second  aorist  active  participle  of  aphistemi,  made  an  "apos- 
tasy" (standing  off,  cleavage)  as  he  did  at  Corinth  (18:7, 
metabaSy  making  a  change).  Separated  the  disciples  {aphor- 
isen  tous  mathetas).  First  aorist  active  indicative  of  aphorizo, 
old  verb  to  mark  limits  (horizon)  as  already  in  13:2.  Paul 
himself  was  a  spiritual  Pharisee  "separated"  to  Christ 
(Rom.  I  :i).  The  Jews  regarded  this  withdrawal  as  apostasy, 
like  separating  the  sheep  from  the  goats  (Matt.  25:32). 
Paul  now  made  a  separate  church  as  he  had  done  at  Thes- 
salonica  and  Corinth.  In  the  school  of  Tyrannus  (en  tei 
scholei  Turannou).  Schole  (our  school)  is  an  old  word  from 
schein  (echo)  to  hold  on,  leisure  and  then  in  later  Greek 
(Plutarch,  etc.)  a  place  where  there  is  leisure  as  here.  Only 
this  example  in  the  N.T.  This  is  the  Greek  notion  of 
"school,"  the  Jewish  being  that  of  "yoke"  as  in  Matt.  1 1 :29. 
The  name  Tyrannus  (our  tyrant)  is  a  common  one.  It  is  an 
inscription  in  the  Columbarium  of  the  Empress  Livia  as 
that  of  a  physician  in  the  court.     Furneaux  suggests  the 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  315 

possibility  that  a  relative  of  this  physician  was  lecturing 
on  medicine  in  Ephesus  and  so  as  a  friend  of  Luke,  the 
physician,  would  be  glad  to  help  Paul  about  a  place  to 
preach.  It  was  probably  a  public  building  or  lecture  hall 
with  this  name  whether  hired  by  Paul  or  loaned  to  him. 
The  pagan  sophists  often  spoke  in  such  halls.  The  Codex 
Bezae  adds  "from  the  fifth  hour  to  the  tenth"  as  the  time 
allotted  Paul  for  his  work  in  this  hall,  which  is  quite  possible, 
from  just  before  midday  till  the  close  of  the  afternoon  (from 
before  the  noon  meal  till  two  hours  before  sunset)  each  day. 
Here  Paul  had  great  freedom  and  a  great  hearing.  As  the 
church  grows  there  will  be  other  places  of  meeting  as  the 
church  in  the  house  of  Aquila  and  Priscilla  (I  Cor.  16:19). 
10.  For  two  years  (epi  ete  duo).  Note  epi  with  accusative 
for  extent  of  time  as  in  verse  8,  epi  menas  treis  and  often.  But 
in  20:31  Paul  said  to  the  Ephesian  elders  at  Miletus  that  he 
laboured  with  them  for  the  space  of  "three  years."  That  may 
be  a  general  expression  and  there  was  probably  a  longer 
period  after  the  "two  years"  in  the  school  of  Tyrannus 
besides  the  six  months  in  the  synagogue.  Paul  may  have 
preached  thereafter  in  the  house  of  Aquila  and  Priscilla  for 
some  months,  the  "for  a  while"  of  verse  22.  So  that  all  they 
which  dwelt  in  Asia  heard  {hoste  pantas  tous  katoikountas  ten 
Asian  akousai).  Actual  result  with  hoste  and  the  infinitive 
with  accusative  of  general  reference  as  is  common  (also 
verse  11)  in  the  Koine  (Robertson,  Grammar ^  pp.  999f.). 
Paul  apparently  remained  in  Ephesus,  but  the  gospel  spread 
all  over  the  province  even  to  the  Lycus  Valley  including  the 
rest  of  the  seven  churches  of  Rev.  i  :i  i  and  chapters  2  and  3. 
Demetrius  in  verse  26  will  confirm  the  tremendous  influence 
of  Paul's  ministry  in  Ephesus  on  Asia.  Forty  years  after  this 
Pliny  in  his  famous  letter  to  Trajan  from  Bithynia  will 
say  of  Christianity:  "For  the  contagion  of  this  superstition 
has  not  only  spread  through  cities,  but  also  through  villages 
and  country  places."    It  was  during  these  years  in  Ephesus 


'l6      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

that  Paul  was  greatly  disturbed  over  the  troubles  In  the 
Corinthian  Church.  He  apparently  wrote  a  letter  to  them 
now  lost  to  us  (I  Cor.  5:9),  received  messages  from  the  house- 
hold of  Chloe,  a  letter  from  the  church,  special  messengers, 
sent  Timothy,  then  Titus,  may  have  made  a  hurried  trip 
himself,  wrote  our  First  Corinthians,  was  planning  to  go 
after  the  return  of  Titus  to  Troas  where  he  was  to  meet  him 
after  Pentecost,  when  all  of  a  sudden  the  uproar  raised  by 
Demetrius  hurried  Paul  away  sooner  than  he  had  planned. 
Meanwhile  Apollos  had  returned  from  Corinth  to  Ephesus 
and  refused  to  go  back  (I  Cor.  16:12).  Paul  doubtless  had 
helpers  like  Epaphras  and  Philemon  who  carried  the  mes- 
sage over  the  province  of  Asia,  Tychicus,  and  Trophimus  of 
Asia  who  were  with  him  on  the  last  visit  to  Jerusalem  (verses 
22,  29;  20:4).  Paul's  message  reached  Greeks,  not  merely 
Hellenists  and  God-fearers,  but  some  of  the  Greeks  in  the 
upper  circles  of  life  in  Ephesus. 

1 1.  Special  miracles  {dunameis  ou  tas  tuchousas).  "Powers 
not  the  ones  that  happen  by  chance,"  "not  the  ordinary 
ones,"  litotes  for  "the  extraordinary."  All  "miracles"  or 
"powers"  {dunameis)  are  supernatural  and  out  of  the  or- 
dinary, but  here  God  regularly  wrought  {epoiei,  imperfect 
active)  wonders  beyond  those  familiar  to  the  discipjes  and 
completely  different  from  the  deeds  of  the  Jewish  exorcists. 
This  phrase  is  peculiar  to  Luke  in  the  N.T.  (also  28 :2),  but  it 
occurs  in  the  classical  Greek  and  in  the  Koine  as  in  III  Mace. 
3:7  and  in  papyri  and  inscriptions  (Deissmann,  Bible  Studies, 
p.  255).  In  Samaria  Philip  wrought  miracles  to  deliver  the 
people  from  the  influence  of  Simon  Magus.  Here  in  Ephesus 
exorcists  and  other  magicians  had  built  an  enormous  vogue 
of  a  false  spiritualism  and  Paul  faces  unseen  forces  of  evil. 
His  tremendous  success  led  some  people  to  superstitious 
practices  thinking  that  there  was  power  in  Paul's  person. 

12.  Handkerchiefs  (soudaria).  Latin  word  for  sudor 
(sweat).    Used  in  Luke  19:20  and  John  11:44;  20:7.    In  two 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  317 

papyri  marriage-contracts  this  word  occurs  among  the  toilet 
articles  in  the  dowry  (Deissmann,  Bihle  Studies,  p.  223). 
Aprons  {simikinthid) .  Latin  word  also,  semicinctium  (semi, 
cingo).  Only  here  in  the  N.T.  Linen  aprons  used  by  servants 
or  artisans  (Martial  XIV.  153).  Paul  did  manual  work  at 
Ephesus  (20:34)  ^^^  so  wore  these  aprons.  Departed  {apal- 
lassethai).  Present  passive  infinitive  with  hbste  for  actual 
result  as  in  verse  10.  If  one  wonders  how  God  could  honour 
such  superstitious  faith,  he  should  remember  that  there  is 
no  power  in  superstition  or  in  magic,  but  in  God.  If  God 
never  honoured  any  faith  save  that  entirely  free  from  super- 
stition, how  about  Christian  people  who  are  troubled  over 
the  number  13,  over  the  moon,  the  rabbit's  foot?  The  poor 
woman  with  an  issue  of  blood  touched  the  hem  of  Christ's 
garment  and  was  healed  (Luke  8:44-46)  as  others  sought  to 
do  (Matt.  14:36).  God  condescends  to  meet  us  in  our  igno- 
rance and  weakness  where  he  can  reach  us.  Elisha  had  a 
notion  that  some  of  the  power  of  Elijah  resided  in  his  mantle 
(II  Kings  2:13).  Some  even  sought  help  from  Peter's  shadow 
(Acts  5:15). 

13.  Of  the  strolling  Jews,  exorcists  {ton  perierchomenon 
loudaion  exorkistbn).  These  exorcists  travelled  around 
{peri)  from  place  to  place  like  modem  Gypsy  fortune-tellers. 
The  Jews  were  especially  addicted  to  such  practices  with 
spells  of  sorcery  connected  with  the  name  of  Solomon 
(Josephus,  Ant.  VIII.  2.5).  See  also  Tobit  8:1-3.  Jesus 
alludes  to  those  in  Palestine  (Matt.  12:27  =  Luke  11:19). 
The  exorcists  were  originally  those  who  administered  an 
oath  (from  exorkizo,  to  exact  an  oath),  then  to  use  an  oath 
as  a  spell  or  charm.  Only  instance  here  in  the  N.T.  These 
men  regarded  Paul  as  one  of  their  own  number  just  as  Simon 
Magus  treated  Simon  Peter.  Only  here  these  exorcists  paid 
Paul  the  compliment  of  imitation  instead  of  offering  money 
as  Magus  did.  To  name  over  {onomazein  epi).  They  heard 
what  Paul  said  and  treated  his  words  as  a  magic  charm  or 


3l8      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

spell  to  drive  the  evil  spirits  out.  /  adjure  you  by  Jesus  whom 
Paul  preacheth  (Horkizo  humas  ton  lesoun  hon  Paulas  kerus- 
sei).  Note  two  accusatives  with  the  verb  of.  swearing  (cf. 
Mark  57)  as  a  causative  verb  (Robertson,  Grammar^  p.  483). 
The  papyri  furnish  numerous  instances  of  horkizo  in  such 
constructions  (Deissmann,  Bible  Studies,  p.  281).  Note  also 
the  article  with  Jesus,  "the  Jesus,"  as  if  to  identify  the 
magic  word  to  the  demons  with  the  addition  "whom  Paul 
preaches."  They  thought  that  success  turned  on  the  correct 
use  of  the  magical  formula.  The  Ephesian  mysteries  in- 
cluded Christianity,  so  they  supposed. 

14.  Seven  sons  of  Sceva  (Skeud  hepta  huioi).  Who  this 
Sceva  was  we  do  not  know.  If  a  high  priest,  he  was  highly 
connected  in  Jerusalem  (cf.  5:24).  Some  MSS.  have  ruler 
instead  of  priest.  His  name  may  be  Latin  in  origin.  Skeud 
has  Doric  form  of  genitive.  But  that  he  had  seven  sons  in 
this  degraded  business  shows  how  Judaism  had  fared  poorly 
in  this  superstitious  city.  Did  they  imagine  there  was 
special  power  in  the  number  seven  ^ 

15.  Jesus  I  know  {ton  lesoun  ginosko).  "The  (whom  you 
mention)  Jesus  I  recognize  (ginosko)"  and  "the  (whom  you 
mentioned)  Paul  I  ainacguainted  with  {ton  Paulon  epis- 
tamai)y  Clear  distinction  between  ginosko  and  epistamai. 
But  who  are  ye?  {humeis  de  tines  este?).  But  you,  who  are 
you.?    Emphatic  prolepsis. 

16.  Leaped  on  them  {ephalomenos  ep*  autous).  Second 
aorist  (ingressive)  middle  participle  of  ephallomai,  old  verb 
to  spring  upon  likeapanther,  here  only  in  the  N.T.  Mas- 
tered {katakurieusas).  First  aorist  (effective)  active  participle 
of  katakurieuo,  late  verb  from  kata  and  kurios,  to  become  lord 
or  master  of.  Both  {amphoteron).  Papyri  examples  exist 
where  amphoteroi means  "all"  or  more  than  "two"  (Robert- 
son, Grammar,  p.  745).  So  here  amphoteroi  includes  all 
seven.  "Both"  in  old  English  was  used  for  more  than  two. 
So  that  {hoste).  Another  example  (verses  10,  11)  of  hoste  with 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  319 

the  infinitive  for  result.  Naked  (gumnous).  Probably  with 
torn  garments.  Wounded  (tetraumatismenous).  Perfect 
passive  participle  of  traumatizo,  old  verb  to  wound,  from 
trauma  (a  wound).    In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  20:12. 

17.  Was  magnified  (emegaluneto).  Imperfect  passive.  To 
make  great.  It  was  a  notable  victory  over  the  powers  of 
evil  in  Ephesus. 

18.  Came  (erchonto).  Imperfect  middle,  kept  coming,  one 
after  another.  Even  some  of  the  believers  were  secretly  under 
the  spell  of  these  false  spiritualists  just  as  some  Christians 
todavcherish  private  contacts  with  so-called  occult  powers 
fKfn^gh  mediums,  seances,  of  which  they  are  ashamed . 
Confessing  (exomologoumenot).  It  was  time  to  make  a  clean 
breast  of  it  all,  to  turn  on  the  light,  to  unbosom  their  secret 
habits.  Declaring  their  deeds  {anaggellontes  tas  praxeis 
auton).  Judgment  was  beginning  at  the  house  of  God.  The 
dupes  (professing  believers,  alas)  of  these  jugglers  or  exorcists 
now  had  their  eyes  opened  when  they  saw  the  utter  defeat 
of  the  tricksters  who  had  tried  to  use  the  name  of  Jesus 
without  his  power.  The  boomerang  was  tremendous.  The 
black  arts  were  now  laid  bare  in  their  real  character.  Gentile 
converts  had  a  struggle  to  shake  off  their  corrupt  environ- 
ment. 

19.  Not  a  few  of  them  that  practised  curious  arts  {hikanoi 
ton  ta  perierga  praxanton).  Considerable  number  of  the  per- 
formers or  exorcists  themselves  who  knew  that  they  were 
humbugs  were  led  to  renounce  their  evil  practices.  The  word 
perierga  (curious)  is  an  old  word  {peri,  erga)  originally  a 
piddler  about  trifles,  a  busybody  (I  Tim.  5:13),  then  im- 
pertinent and  magical  things  as  here.  Only  two  examples  in 
the  N.T.  It  is  a  technical  term  for  magic  at  the  papyri  and 
inscriptions  show.  Deissmann  {Bible  Studies,  p.  323)  thinks 
that  these  books  here  burned  were  just  like  the  Magic 
Papyri  now  recovered  from  Egypt.  Burned  them  in  the  si^t 
of  all  {katekaion  endpion  panton).     Imperfect  active  of  kata-

kaid.  It  probably  took  a  good  while  to  do  it,  burned  them 
completely  (up,  we  say;  down,  the  Greeks  say,  perfective

Ephesus  was  largely  Greek  and  probably  the  silver  pieces 
were  Greek  drachmae  or  the  Latin  denarius,  probably  about 
ten  thousand  dollars  or  two  thousand  English  pounds. 

20.  Mightily  {kata  kratos).  According  to  strength.  Only

proof  of  a  change  counted.  Grew  and  prevailed  {euxanen  kai

turies will  be  one  of  the  centres  of  Christian  power.  Timothy 
will  come  here  and  John  the  Apostle  and  Polycarp  and 
Irenaeus. 

21.  Purposed  in  the  spirit  {etheto  en  toi  pneumati) .  Second 
aorist  middle  indicative  for  mental  action  and  "spirit" 
expressed  also.  A  new  stage  In  Paul's  career  begins  here, 
a  new  division  of  the  Acts.  Passed  through  {dielthbn).  Word 
{dierchomai)  used  ten  times  in  Acts  (cf.  19:1)  of  missionary 
journeys  (Ramsay).  Macedonia  and  Achaia  {ten  Makedonian 
kai  Achaian).  This  was  the  way  that  he  actually  went,  but 
originally  he  had  planned   to  go  to  Achaia   (Corinth)  and 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  321 

then  to  Macedonia,  as  he  says  in  II  Cor.  1:1  sf.,  but  he  had 
now  changed  that  purpose,  perhaps  because  of  the  bad  news 
from  Corinth.  Already  when  he  wrote  I  Corinthians  he  pro- 
posed to  go  first  to  Macedonia  (I  Cor.  16:5-7).  He  even 
hoped  to  spend  the  winter  in  Corinth  "if  the  Lord  permit" 
and  to  remain  in  Ephesus  till  Pentecost,  neither  of  which 
things  he  did.  /  must  also  see  Rome  {dei  me  kai  Rom  en  idein). 
This  section  of  Acts  begins  with  Rome  in  the  horizon  of 
Paul's  plans  and  the  book  closes  with  Paul  in  Rome  (Rack- 
ham).  Here  he  feels  the  necessity  of  going  as  in  Rom.  1:15 
he  feels  himself  "debtor"  to  all  including  "those  in  Rome" 
(verse  16).  Paul  had  long  desired  to  go  to  Rome  (Rom.  i  :io), 
but  had  been  frequently  hindered  (1:13),  but  he  has  def- 
initely set  his  face  to  go  to  Rome  and  on  to  Spain  (15 :23-29). 
Paley  calls  sharp  attention  to  this  parallel  between  Acts  19:21 
and  Rom.  1:10-15  ^^^  15:23-29.  Rome  h^  a  fascination 
for  Paul  as  the  home  of  Aquila  and  Priscilla  and  numerous 
other  friends  (Rom.  16),  but  chiefly  as  the  capital  of  the 
Roman  Empire  and  a  necessary  goal  in  Paul's  ambition  to 
win  it  to  Jesus  Christ.  His  great  work  in  Asia  had  stirred 
afresh  in  him  the  desire  to  do  his  part  for  Rome.  He  wrote 
to  Rome  from  Corinth  not  long  after  this  and  in  Jerusalem 
Jesus  in  vision  will  confirm  the  necessity  (dei)  that  Paul  see 
Rome  (Acts  23:11). 

22.  Timothy  and  Erastus  (Timotheon  kai  Eraston).  Paul 
had  sent  Timothy  to  Corinth  (I  Cor.  4:17)  and  had  requested 
kindly  treatment  of  this  young  minister  in  his  difficult  task 
of  placating  the  divided  church  (16:10-11)  that  he  might 
return  to  Paul  as  he  evidently  had  before  Paul  leaves  Ephe- 
sus. He  then  despatched  Titus  to  Corinth  to  finish  what 
Timothy  had  not  quite  succeeded  in  doing  with  instructions 
to  meet  him  in  Troas.  Now  Timothy  and  Erastus  (cf.  Rom. 
16:23;  II  Tim.  4:20)  go  on  to  Macedonia  to  prepare  the  way 
for  Paul  who  will  come  on  later.  He  himself  stayed  in  Asia 
for  a  while  {autos  e-peschen  chronon  eis  ten  Asian).    Literally, 


322      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

He  himself  had  additional  time  in  Asia.  Second  aorist 
active  indicative  of  ep^cho,  old  and  common  idiom,  only 
here  in  the  N.T.  in  this  sense  and  the  verb  only  in  Luke  and 
Paul.  The  reason  for  Paul's  delay  is  given  by  him  in  I  Cor. 
l6:8f.,  the  great  door  wide  open  in  Ephesus.  Here  again 
Luke  and  Paul  supplement  each  other.  Pentecost  came  to- 
wards the  end  of  May  and  May  was  the  month  of  the  festival 
of  Artemis  (Diana)  when  great  multitudes  would  come  to 
Ephesus.  But  he  did  not  remain  till  Pentecost  as  both  Luke 
and  Paul  make  plain. 

23.  No  small  stir  {tarachos  ouk  oligos).  Same  phrase  in 
12:18  and  nowhere  else  in  the  N.T.  Litotes.  Concerning  the 
Way  {peri  tes  hodou).  See  this  phrase  for  Christianity  in  9:2; 
19:9;  24:22  which  see,  like  the  "Jesus  Way"  of  the  Indians. 
There  had  already  been  opposition  and  "stir"  before  this 
stage  (cf.  19:11-20).  The  fight  with  wild  beasts  in  I  Cor. 
15:32  (whatever  it  was)  was  before  that  Epistle  was  written 
and  so  before  this  new  uproar.  Paul  as  a  Roman  citizen 
could  not  be  thrown  to  wild  beasts,  but  he  so  pictured  the 
violent  opponents  of  Christ  in  Ephesus. 

24.  DemetriuSj  a  silversmith  {Demetrios  argurokopos).  The 
name  is  common  enough  and  may  or  may  not  be  the  man 
mentioned  in  III  John  12  who  was  also  from  the  neighbour- 
hood of  Ephesus.  There  is  on  an  inscription  at  Ephesus  near 
the  close  of  the  century  a  Demetrius  called  neopoios  Artemidos 
a  temple  warden  of  Artemis  (Diana).  Zoeckler  suggests  that 
Luke  misunderstood  this  word  neopoios  and  translated  it 
into  argurokopos,  a  beater  (kopto,  to  beat)  of  silver  (arguros, 
silver),  "which  made  silver  shrines  of  Artemis"  [poion  naous 
(argurous)  Artemidos].  It  is  true  that  no  silver  shrines  of 
the  temple  have  been  found  in  Ephesus,  but  only  numerous 
terra-cotta  ones.  Ramsay  suggests  that  the  silver  ones 
would  naturally  be  melted  down.  The  date  is  too  late  any- 
how to  identify  the  Demetrius  who  was  neopoios  with  the 
Demetrius   argurokopos  who  made   little  silver  temples  of 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  323 

Artemis,  though  B  does  not  have  the  word  argurous.  The 
poor  votaries  would  buy  the  terra-cotta  ones,  the  rich  the 
silver  shrines  (Ramsay,  Paul  the  Traveller^  p.  278).  These 
small  models  of  the  temple  with  the  statue  of  Artemis  in- 
side would  be  set  up  ih  the  houses  or  even  worn  as  amulets. 
It  is  a  pity  that  the  Revised  Version  renders  Artemis  here. 
Diana  as  the  Ephesian  Artemis  is  quite  distinct  from  the 
Greek  Artemis,  the  sister  of  Apollo,  the  Diana  of  the  Romans. 
This  temple,  built  in  the  6th  century  B.C.,  was  burnt  by 
Herostratus  Oct.  13  b.c.  356,  the  night  when  Alexander  the 
Great  was  born.  It  was  restored  and  was  considered  one  of 
the  seven  wonders  of  the  world.  Artemis  was  worshipped 
as  the  goddess  of  fertility,  like  the  Lydian  Cybele,  a  figure 
with  many  breasts.  The  great  festival  in  May  would  offer 
Demetrius  a  golden  opportunity  for  the  sale  of  the  shrines. 
Brought  no  little  business  {pareicheto  ouk  oligen  ergasian). 
Imperfect  middle,  continued  to  bring  (furnish,  provide). 
The  middle  accents  the  part  that  Demetrius  played  as  the 
leader  of  the  guild  of  silversmiths,  work  for  himself  and  for 
them.  Unto  the  craftsmen  {tais  technitais).  The  artisans  from 
techne  (craft,  art).  Trade  guilds  were  common  in  the  ancient 
world.  Demetrius  had  probably  organized  this  guild  and 
provided  the  capital  for  the  enterprise. 

25.  Whom  he  gathered  together  (hous  sunathroisas).  First 
aorist  active  participle  of  sunathroizOj  old  verb  to  assemble 
together  {athroos,  a  crowd),  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts 
12:12.  With  the  workmen  of  like  occupation  (kai  tous  peri  ta 
toiauta  ergatas).  "And  the  workmen  concerning  such  things," 
apparently  those  who  made  the  marble  and  terra-cotta 
shrines  who  would  also  be  affected  in  the  same  way.  It  was 
a  gathering  of  the  associated  trades,  not  for  a  strike,  for 
employer  and  employees  met  together,  but  in  protest  against 
the  preaching  of  Paul.  We  have  our  wealth  {he  euporia  hemin 
estin).  The  wealth  is  to  us  (dative  of  possession).  This  old 
word  for  wealth  occurs  here  alone  in  the  N.T.   It  is  from  eu 


324      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

and  poros,  easy  to  pass  through,  easy  to  accomplish,  to  be 
well  off,  wealthy,  welfare,  weal,  well-being,  rich.  Demetrius 
appeals  to  this  knowledge  and  self-Interest  of  the  artisans 
as  the  basis  for  their  zeal  for  Artemis,  piety  for  revenue. 

26.  At  Ephesus  {Ephesou).  Genitive  of  place  as  also  with 
Asias  (Asia).  Cf.  Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  494f.  This  Paul 
{ho  Paulos  houtos).  Contemptuous  use  of  houtos.  Hath 
turned  away  {metestesen).  Changed,  transposed.  First  aorist 
active  indicative,  did  change.  Tribute  to  Paul's  powers  as  a 
preacher  borne  out  by  Luke's  record  in  19:10,  There  may 
be  an  element  of  exaggeration  on  the  part  of  Demetrius  to 
incite  the  workmen  to  action,  for  the  worship  of  Artemis 
was  their  wealth.  Paul  had  cut  the  nerve  of  their  business. 
There  had  long  been  a  Jewish  colony  in  Ephesus,  but  their 
protest  against  idolatry  was  as  nothing  compared  with  Paul's 
preaching  (Furneaux).  Which  are  made  with  hands  {hoi  dia 
cheiron  ginomenoi).  Note  the  present  tense,  made  from  time 
to  time.  No  doubt  Paul  had  put  the  point  sharply  as  in 
Athens  (Acts  17:29).  Isaiah  (44:9-17)  had  pictured  graphic- 
ally the  absurdity  of  worshipping  stocks  and  stones,  flatly 
forbidden  by  the  Old  Testament  (Ex.  20:4;  Psa.  135:15-18). 
The  people  identified  their  gods  with  the  images  of  them  and 
Demetrius  reflects  that  point  of  view.  He  was  jealous  of  the 
brand  of  gods  turned  out  by  his  factory.  The  artisans  would 
stand  by  him  on  this  point.  It  was  a  reflection  on  their  work. 

27.  This  our  trade  {touto  to  meros).^  Part,  share,  task, 
job,  trade.  Come  into  disrepute  {eis  apelegmon  elthein).  Not 
in  the  old  writers,  but  In  LXX  and  Koine.  Literally,  reputa- 
tion, exposure,  censure,  rejection  after  examination,  and  so 
disrepute.  Their  business  of  making  gods  would  lose  caste 
as  the  liquor  trade  (still  called  the  trade  in  England)  has  done 
in  our  day.  They  felt  this  keenly  and  so  Demetrius  names  it 
first.  They  felt  it  in  their  pockets.  Of  the  great  goddess 
Artemis  {tes  megales  theas  Artemidos).  She  was  generally 
known  as  the  Great  {he  Megale).    An  inscription  found  at

Ephesus  calls  her  "the  greatest  god"  {he  megiste  theos).  The 
priests  were  eunuchs  and  there  were  virgin  priestesses  and 
a  lower  order  of  slaves  known  as  temple-sweepers  (nedkoroiy 
verse  35).  They  had  wild  orgiastic  exercises  that  were  dis- 
graceful with  their  Corybantic  processions  and  revelries. 
Be  made  of  no  account  {eis  outhen  logisthenai).  Be  reckoned 
as  nothing,  first  aorist  passive  infinitive  of  logizomai  and  eis. 
Should  even  he  deposed  of  her  magnificence  {mellein  te  kai  kath- 
aireisthai  tes  megaleiotetos  autes).  Note  the  present  infinitive 
after  mellein,  ablative  case  (so  best  MSS.)  after  kathaired,  to 
take  down,  to  depose,  to  deprive  of.  The  word  megaleiotes 
occurs  also  in  Luke  9:43  (the  majesty  of  God)  and  in  II  Peter 
I  :i6  of  the  transfiguration  of  Christ.  It  is  already  in  the  LXX 
and  Deissmann  {Light  from  the  Ancient  East,  p.  363)  thinks 
that  the  word  runs  parallel  with  terms  used  in  the  emperor- 
cult.  All  Asia  and  the  world  [hole  {he)  Asia  kai  {he)  oikou- 
mene].  See  1 1 :28  for  same  use  of  oikoumene.  An  exaggera- 
tion, to  be  sure,  but  Pausanias  says  that  no  deity  was  more 
widely  worshipped.  Temples  of  Artemis  have  been  found 
in  Spain  and  Gaul.  Multitudo  errantium  non  efficit  veritatem 
(Bengel).  Even  today  heathenism  has  more  followers  than 
Christianity.  To  think  that  all  this  splendour  was  being  set 
at  naught  by  one  man  and  a  despised  Jew  at  that! 

28.  They  were  filled  with  wrath  {genomenoi  plereis  thumou). 
Having  become  full  of  wrath.  Cried  out  {ekrazon).  Inchoative 
imperfect,  began  to  cry  out  and  kept  it  up  continuously. 
Reiteration  was  characteristic  of  the  orgiastic  exercises.  The 
Codex  Bezae  adds  after  thumou  (wrath) :  Dramontes  eis  ten 
amphodon  (running  into  the  street),  which  they  certainly 
did  after  the  speech  of  Demetrius.  Great  is  Artemis  of  the 
Ephesians  {Megale  he  Artemis  Ephesion).  D  (Codex  Bezae) 
omits  he  (the)  and  makes  it  read:  "Great  Artemis  of  the 
Ephesians."  This  was  the  usual  cry  of  the  votaries  in  their 
orgies  as  the  inscriptions  show,  an  ejaculatory  outcry  or 
prayer  instead  of  an  argument  as  the  other  MSS.  have  it.

That  is  vivid  and  natural  (Ranisay,  Church  in  the  Roman 
Empire y  pp.  i35fF.)'  Yet  on  this  occasion  the  artisans  were 
making  an  argumentative  protest  and  plea  against  Paul. 
An  inscription  at  Dionysopolis  has  "Great  is  Apollo." 

29.  With  the  confusion  {tes  sugchuseos).  Genitive  case 
after  eplesthe.  An  old  word,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here,  from 
verb  sugched,  to  pour  together  like  a  flood  (only  in  Acts  in  the 
N.T.).  Vivid  description  of  the  inevitable  riot  that  followed 
"the  appearance  of  such  a  body  in  the  crowded  agora  of  an 
excitable  city"  (Rackham)  "vociferating  the  city's  watch- 
word." They  rushed  (hormesan).  Ingressive  aorist  active 
indicative  of  hormad,  old  verb  for  impetuous  dashing,  a  case 
of  mob  psychology  (mob  mind),  with  one  accord  {homo- 
ihumadon  as  in  Acts  1:14,  etc.).  Into  the  theatre  {eis  to  theon 
iron).  A  place  for  seeing  {theaomai)  spectacles,  originally 
for  dramatic  representation  (Thucydides,  Herodotus),  then 
for  the  spectators,  then  for  the  spectacle  or  show  (I  Cor. 
4:9).  The  theatre  (amphitheatre)  at  Ephesus  can  still  be 
traced  in  the  ruins  (Wood,  Ephesus)  and  shows  that  it  was 
of  enormous  size  capable  of  seating  fifty-six  thousand  per- 
sons (some  estimate  it  only  24,500).  It  was  the  place  for 
large  public  gatherings  of  any  sort  out  of  doors  like  our  foot- 
ball and  baseball  parks.  In  particular,  gladiatorial  shows 
were  held  in  these  theatres.  Having  seized  Gaius  and  Aristar- 
chus  men  of  Macedonia  {sunarpasantes  Gaion  kai  Aristarchon 
Makedonas).  See  6:12  for  this  same  verb.  They  wanted  some 
victims  for  this  "gladiatorial"  show.  These  two  men  were 
"Paul's  companions  in  travel"  {sunekdemous  Paulou), 
together  (sun)  with  Paul  in  being  abroad,  away  from  home 
or  people  {ek-demous^  late  word,  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and 
II  Cor.  8:19).  How  the  mob  got  hold  of  Gaius  (Acts  204) 
and  Aristarchus  (20-4;  27:2;  Col.  4:10;  Philemon  24)  we  do 
not  know  whether  by  accidental  recognition  or  by  search 
after  failure  to  get  Paul.  In  Rom.  164  Paul  speaks  of 
Priscilla  and  Aquila  as  those  "who  for  my  life  laid  down  their 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  327 

own  necks."  Paul  lived  with  them  in  Ephesus  as  in  Corinth. 
It  is  possible  that  Demetrius  led  the  mob  to  their  house  and 
that  they  refused  to  allow  Paul  to  go  or  to  be  seized  at  the 
risk  of  their  own  lives.  Paul  himself  may  have  been  desper- 
ately ill  at  this  time  as  we  know  was  the  case  once  during  his 
stay  in  Ephesus  when  he  felt  the  answer  of  death  in  himself 
(II  Cor.  I  :g)  and  when  God  rescued  him.  That  may  mean 
that,  ill  as  he  was,  Paul  wanted  to  go  and  face  the  mob  in 
the  theatre,  knowing  that  it  meant  certain  death. 

30.  And  when  Paul  was  minded  to  enter  in  unto  the  people 
{Paulou  de  boulomenou  eiselthein  eis  ton  demon).  Genitive 
absolute.  Plainly  Paul  wanted  to  face  the  howling  mob, 
whether  it  was  the  occasion  pictured  in  II  Cor.  1 19  or  not. 
"St.  Paul  was  not  the  man  to  leave  his  comrades  in  the 
lurch"  (Knowling).  Suffered  him  not  (auk  eion  auton).  Im- 
perfect of  eaOf  common  verb  to  allow,  what  Gildersleeve  called 
the  negative  imperfect  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  885),  denot- 
ing resistance  to  pressure.  The  more  Paul  insisted  on  going 
the  more  the  disciples  refused  to  agree  to  it  and  they  won. 

31.  Certain  also  of  the  chief  officers  of  Asia  {tines  de  kai  ton 
Asiarchbn).  These  "Asiarchs"  were  ten  officers  elected  by 
cities  in  the  province  who  celebrated  at  their  own  cost  public 
games  and  festivals  (Page).  Each  province  had  such  a  group 
of  men  chosen,  as  we  now  know  from  inscriptions,  to  super- 
vise the  funds  connected  with  the  worship  of  the  emperor, 
to  preside  at  games  and  festivals  even  when  the  temple 
services  were  to  gods  like  Artemis.  Only  rich  men  could 
act,  but  the  position  was  eagerly  sought.  Being  his  friends 
(pntes  autbi  philoi).  Evidently  the  Asiarchs  had  a  high 
opinion  of  Paul  and  were  unwilling  for  him  to  expose  his 
life  to  a  wild  mob  during  the  festival  of  Artemis.  They  were 
at  least  tolerant  toward  Paul  and  his  preaching.  "It  was  an 
Asiarch  who  at  Smyrna  resisted  the  cry  of  the  populace  to 
throw  Polycarp  to  the  lions"  (Furneaux).  Besought  him 
(parekaloun  auton).      Imperfect  active,  showing  that  the

messengers  sent  had  to  Insist  over  Paul's  protest.  ^^Not  to 
adventure  himself^''  {me  dounai  heauton).  It  was  a  hazard,  a 
rash  adventure  "to  give  himself"  (second  aorist  active  in- 
finitive of  didomi).  Just  this  sense  of  "adventure"  with 
the  idiom  occurs  only  here  in  the  N.T.,  though  in  Polybius 
v.,  14,  9.  But  the  phrase  itself  Paul  uses  of  Jesus  who  gave 
himself  for  our  sins  (Gal.  i  :4;  I  Tim.  2:6;  Titus  2:14).  It  is 
not  the  first  time  that  friends  had  rescued  Paul  from  peril 
(Acts  9:25,  30;  17:10,  14).  The  theatre  was  no  place  for  Paul. 
It  meant  certain  death. 

32.  Some  therefore  cried  one  thing  and  some  another  (alloi 
men  oun  alio  ti  ekrazon).  This  classical  use  of  alios  alio 
(Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  747)  appears  also  in  2:12;  21:34. 
Literally,  "others  cried  another  thing."  The  imperfect 
shows  the  repetition  (kept  on  crying)  and  confusion  which 
is  also  distinctly  stated.  For  the  assembly  was  in  confusion 
{en  gar  he  ekklesia  sunkechumene) .  The  reason  for  the  pre- 
vious statement.  Periphrastic  past  perfect  passive  of  sug- 
cheo,  sugchuno  {-unno),  to  pour  together,  to  commingle  as  in 
verse  29  {sugchuseos).  It  was  not  an  "assembly"  {ekklesia, 
ek,  kaleo,  to  call  out),  but  a  wholly  Irregular,  disorganized 
mob  in  a  state  (perfect  tense)  of  confusion.  There  was  "a 
lawful  assembly"  (verse  39),  but  this  mob  was  not  one. 
Luke  shows  his  contempt  for  this  mob  (Furneaux).  Had  come 
together  {sunelelutheisan) .  Past  perfect  active  of  sunerchomai. 
It  was  an  assembly  only  in  one  sense.  For  some  reason  De- 
metrius who  was  responsible  for  the  mob  preferred  now  to 
keep  In  the  background,  though  he  was  known  to  be  the 
ring-leader  of  the  gathering  (verse  38).  It  was  just  a  mob 
that  shouted  because  others  did. 

33.  And  they  brought  Alexander  out  of  the  crowd  {ek  de  tou 
ochlou  sunebibasan  Alexandron).  The  correct  text  (Aleph 
A  B)  has  this  verb  sunebibasan  (from  sunbibazb,  to  put  to- 
gether) instead  of  proebibasan  (from  probibazo,  to  put  for- 
ward).  It  is  a  graphic  word,  causal  of  baino,  to  go,  and  occurs 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  329 

in  Acts  16:10;  Col.  2:19;  Eph.  4:16.  Evidently  some  of  the 
Jews  grew  afraid  that  the  mob  would  turn  on  the  Jews  as  well 
as  on  the  Christians.  Paul  was  a  Jew  and  so  was  Aristarchus, 
one  of  the  prisoners.  The  Jews  were  as  strongly  opposed  to 
idolatry  as  were  the  Christians.  The  Jews  putting  him  for- 
ward (probalonton  anion  ton  loudaion).  Genitive  absolute 
of  the  second  aorist  active  participle  of  proballo,  old  verb 
to  push  forward  as  leaves  in  the  spring  (Luke  21:30).  In 
the  N.T.  only  in  these  two  passages.  Alexandria  had  already 
disgraceful  scenes  of  Jew-baiting  and  there  was  real  peril 
now  in  Ephesus  with  this  wild  mob.  So  Alexander  was 
pushed  forward  as  the  champion  to  defend  the  Jews  to  the 
excited  mob.  He  may  be  the  same  Alexander  the  copper- 
smith who  did  Paul  much  evil  (II  Tim.  4:14),  against  whom 
Paul  will  warn  Timothy  then  in  Ephesus.  "The  Jews  were 
likely  to  deal  in  the  copper  and  silver  required  for  the  shrines, 
so  he  may  have  had  some  trade  connexion  with  the  craftsmen 
which  would  give  him  influence"  (Furneaux).  Beckoned  with 
the  hand  {kataseisas  ten  cheira).  Old  verb  kataseio,  to  shake 
down,  here  the  hand,  rapidly  waving  the  hand  up  and  down 
to  get  a  hearing.  In  the  N.T.  elsewhere  only  in  Acts  12:17; 
13:16;  2i.:40  where  "with  the  hand"  {tei  cheiri,  instrumental 
case)  is  used  instead  of  ten  cheira  (the  accusative).  Would 
have  made  a  defence  unto  the  people  (ethelen  apologeisthai  toi 
dembi).  Imperfect  active,  wanted  to  make  a  defence,  tried 
to,  started  to,  but  apparently  never  got  out  a  word.  Apolo- 
geisthai (present  middle  infinitive,  direct  middle,  to  defend 
oneself),  regular  word  for  formal  apology,  but  in  N.T.  only 
by  Luke  and  Paul  (twice  in  Gospel,  six  times  in  Acts,  and 
in  Rom.  2:15;  II  Cor.  12:19). 

34.  When  they  perceived  (epignontes) .  Recognizing,  coming 
to  know  fully  and  clearly  (epi-),  second  aorist  (ingressive) 
active  participle  of  epiginosko.  The  masculine  plural  is 
left  as  nominative  absolute  or  pendens  without  a  verb.  The 
rioters  saw  at  once  that  Alexander  was  (estin,  present  tense

retained  in  indirect  assertion)  a  Jew  by  his  features.  J II  with 
om  voice  cried  out  {phone  egeneto  mia  ek  panton  krazonton). 
Anacoluthon  or  construction  according  to  sense.  Literally, 
"one  voice  arose  from  all  crying."  Krazonton  agrees  in  case 
(ablative)  with  panton,  but  Aleph  A  have  krazontes.  This 
loose  construction  is  not  uncommon  (Robertson,  Grammar^ 
pp.  436f.).  Now  at  last  the  crowd  became  unanimous  (one 
voice)  at  the  sight  of  a  hated  Jew  about  to  defend  their 
attacks  on  the  worship  of  Artemis.  The  unanimity  lasted 
"about  the  space  of  two  hours"  (hosei  epi  horas  duo),  "as  if 
for  two  hours."  Their  creed  centred  in  this  prolonged  yell: 
"Great  is  Artemis  of  the  Ephesians"  with  which  the  dis- 
turbance started  (verse  28). 

35.  The  town-clerk  (ho  grammateus) .  Ephesus  was  a  free 
city  and  elected  its  own  officers  and  the  recorder  or  secretary 
was  the  chief  magistrate  of  the  city,  though  the  proconsul  of 
the  province  of  Asia  resided  there.  This  officer  is  not  a  mere 
secretary  of  another  officer  or  like  the  copyists  and  students 
of  the  law  among  the  Jews,  but  the  most  influential  person 
in  Ephesus  who  drafted  decrees  with  the  aid  of  the  strati- 
goi,  had  charge  of  the  city's  money,  was  the  power  in  control 
of  the  assembly,  and  communicated  directly  with  the  pro- 
consul. Inscriptions  at  Ephesus  give  frequently  this  very 
title  for  their  chief  officer  and  the  papyri  have  it  also.  The 
precise  function  varied  in  different  cities.  His  name  ap- 
peared on  the  coin  at  Ephesus  issued  in  his  year  of  office. 
Had  quieted  the  multitude  {katasteilas  ton  ochlon).  First 
aorist  active  participle  of  katastello,  to  send  down,  arrange 
dress  (Euripides),  lower  (Plutarch),  restrain  (papyrus 
example),  only  twice  in  the  N.T.  (here  and  verse  36,  be 
quiet),  but  in  LXX  and  Josephus.  He  evidently  took  the 
rostrum  and  his  very  presence  as  the  city's  chief  officer  had 
a  quieting  effect  on  the  billowy  turmoil  and  a  semblance  of 
order  came.  He  waited,  however,  till  the  hubbub  had  nearly 
exhausted  itself  (two  hours)  and  did  not  speak  till  there  was 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  331 

a  chance  to  be  heard.  Saith  (phesin).  Historical  present  for 
vividness.  Hozv  that.  Merely  participle  ousan  and  accusative 
polin  in  indirect  discourse,  no  conjunction  at  all  (Robert- 
son, Grammar,  pp.  i04off.),  common  idiom  after  ginosko,  to 
know.  Temple-keeper  (neokoron).  Old  word  from  neos  {naos), 
temple,  and  koreo,  to  sweep.  Warden,  verger,  cleaner  of  th  - 
temple,  a  sacristan.  So  in  Xenophon  and  Plato.  Inscriptions 
so  describe  Ephesus  as  neokoron  tes  Artemidos  as  Luke  has 
it  here  and  also  applied  to  the  imperial  cultus  which  finally 
had  several  such  temples  in  Ephesus.  Other  cities  claimed 
the  same  honour  of  being  neokoros,  but  it  was  the  peculiar 
boast  of  Ephesus  because  of  the  great  temple  of  Artemis. 
A  coin  of  A.D.  65  describes  Ephesus  as  neokoros.  There  are 
papyri  examples  of  the  term  applied  to  individuals,  one  to 
Priene  as  neokoros  of  the  temple  in  Ephesus  (Moulton  and 
Milligan,  Vocabulary).  And  of  the  image  which  fell  down  from 
Jupiter  (kai  tou  diopetous).  Supply  agalma  (image),  "the 
from  heaven-fallen  image."  From  Zeus  (Dios)  and  peto 
(pipto,  pipeto)j  to  fall.  Zeus  Qupiter)  was  considered  lord 
of  the  sky  or  heaven  and  that  is  the  idea  in  diopetous  here. 
The  legend  about  a  statue  fallen  from  heaven  occurs  con- 
cerning the  statue  of  Artemis  at  Tauris,  Minerva  at  Athens, 
etc.  Thus  the  recorder  soothed  the  vanity  (Rackham)  of 
the  crowd  by  appeal  to  the  world-wide  fame  of  Ephesus  as 
sacristan  of  Artemis  and  of  her  heaven-fallen  image. 

36.  Cannot  be  gainsaid  {anantireton  oun  onton).  Genitive 
absolute  with  oun  (therefore).  Undeniable  (an,  anii,  retos), 
verbal  adjective.  Occasionally  in  late  Greek  (Polybius, 
etc.),  only  here  in  N.T.,  but  adverb  anantiretos  in  Acts 
10:29.  These  legends  were  accepted  as  true  and  appeased  the 
mob.  Ye  ought  {deon  estin).  It  is  necessary.  Periphrastic 
present  indicative  instead  oidei  like  I  Peter  i  :6;  I  Tim.  5:i3f. 
Be  quiet  (katestalmenous) .  Perfect  passive  participle  of 
katastello  (see  verse  35).  Rash  (propetes).  Old  adjective 
from  pro  and  peto,  to  fall  forward,  headlong,  precipitate.    In 


332      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

the  N.T.  only  here  and  II  Tim.  3:4,  though  common  in  the 
Koine.    Better  look  before  you  leap. 

37.  Neither  robbers  of  temples  {cute  hierosulous).  Common 
word  in  Greek  writers  from  hieron,  temple,  and  sulao,  to  rob, 
be  guilty  of  sacrilege.  The  word  is  found  also  on  inscriptions 
in  Ephesus.  The  Jews  were  sometimes  guilty  of  this  crime 
(Rom.  2:22),  since  the  heathen  temples  often  had  vast 
treasures  like  banks.  The  ancients  felt  as  strongly  about 
temple-robbing  as  westerners  used  to  feel  about  a  horse- 
thief.  Nor  blasphemers  of  our  goddess  {oute  blasphemountas 
ten  theon  hemon).  Nor  those  who  blasphemed  our  goddess. 
That  is  to  say,  these  men  (Gaius  and  Aristarchus)  as  Chris- 
tians had  so  conducted  themselves  (Col.  4:5)  that  no  charge 
could  be  placed  against  them  either  in  act  (temple-robbery) 
or  word  (blasphemy).  They  had  done  a  rash  thing  since 
these  men  are  innocent.  Paul  had  used  tact  in  Ephesus  as 
in  Athens  in  avoiding  illegalities. 

38.  Have  a  matter  against  any  one  (echousin  pros  tina 
logon).  For  this  use  of  echo  logon  with  pros  see  Matt.  5:32 
and  Col.  3:13.  The  town-clerk  names  Demetrius  and  the 
craftsmen  (technitai)  as  the  parties  responsible  for  the  riot. 
The  courts  are  open  {agoraioi  agontai).  Supply  hemerai 
(days),  court  days  are  kept,  or  sunodoi,  court-meetings  are 
now  going  on,  Vulgate  conventus  forenses  aguntur.  Old 
adjective  from  agora  (forum)  marketplace  where  trials  were 
held.  Cf.  Acts  17:4.  There  were  regular  court  days  whether 
they  were  in  session  then  or  not.  And  there  are  proconsuls 
{kai  anthupatoi  eisin).  Asia  was  a  senatorial  province  and  so 
had  proconsuls  (general  phrase)  though  only  one  at  a  time, 
"a  rhetorical  plural"  (Lightfoot).  Page  quotes  from  an 
inscription  of  the  age  of  Trajan  on  an  aqueduct  at  Ephesus 
in  which  some  of  Luke's  very  words  occur  (neokoros,  an- 
thupatos,  grammateus,  demos).  Let  them  accuse  one  another 
(egkaleitosan  allelois).  Present  active  imperative  of  egkaleo 
{en,  kaled)y  old  verb  to  call  in  one's  case,  to  bring  a  charge

THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  333 

against,  with  the  dative.  Luke  uses  the  verb  six  times  in 
Acts  for  judicial  proceedings  (19:38,  40;  23:28,  29;  26:2,  7). 
The  town-clerk  makes  a  definite  appeal  to  the  mob  for 
orderly  legal  procedure  as  opposed  to  mob  violence  in  a 
matter  where  money  and  religious  prejudice  unite,  a  striking 
rebuke  to  so-called  lynch-law  proceedings  in  lands  today 
where  Christianity  is  supposed  to  prevail. 

39.  Anything  about  other  matters  (ti  per aitero).  Most  MSB. 
here  have  ti  peri  heteron^  but  B  b  Vulgate  read  ti  peraitero  as 
in  Plato's  Phaedo.  Several  papyri  examples  of  it  also.  It  is 
comparative  peraiteros  of  pera^  beyond.  Note  also  epi  in  epi- 
zeteite.  Charges  of  illegal  conduct  (Page)  should  be  settled 
in  the  regular  legal  way.  But,  if  you  wish  to  go  further  and 
pass  resolutions  about  the  matter  exciting  you,  "it  shall  be 
settled  in  the  regular  assembly"  {en  toi  ennomoi  ekklesidi). 
"In  the  lawful  assembly,"  not  by  a  mob  like  this.  Wood 
{Ephesus)  quotes  an  inscription  there  with  this  very  phrase 
"at  every  lawful  assembly"  {kata  pdsan  ennomon  ekklesian). 
The  Roman  officials  alone  could  give  the  sanction  for  calling 
such  a  lawful  or  regular  assembly.  The  verb  epiluo  is  an 
old  one,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Mark  4:34  (which 
see)  where  Jesus  privately  opened  or  disclosed  the  parables 
to  the  disciples.  The  papyri  give  examples  of  the  verb  in 
financial  transactions  as  well  as  of  the  metaphorical  sense. 
The  solution  will  come  in  the  lawful  assembly,  not  in  a  riot 
like  this.  See  also  II  Peter  1:20  where  the  substantive 
epilusis  occurs  for  disclosure  or  revelation  (prophecy). 

40.  For  indeed  we  are  in  danger  to  he  accused  concerning 
this  day's  riot  {kai  gar  kinduneuomen  egkaleisthai  staseos  peri 
tes  semeron).  The  text  is  uncertain.  The  text  of  Westcott  and 
Hort  means  "to  be  accused  of  insurrection  concerning  to- 
day's assembly."  The  peril  was  real.  Kinduneuomen^  from 
kindunos,  danger,  peril.  Old  verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here 
and  Luke  8:23;  I  Cor.  15:30.  There  being  no  cause  for  it 
{medenos    aitiou    huparchontos) .       Genitive    absolute    with 


334      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

aitios,  common  adjective  (cf.  aitiay  cause)  though  in  N.T. 
only  here  and  Heb.  5:9;  Luke  23:4,  14,  22.  And  as  touching 
it  {peri  hou).  "Concerning  which."  But  what?  No  clear 
antecedent,  only  the  general  idea.  Give  an  account  of  this 
concourse  (apodounai  logon  peri  tes  sustrophes  tautes).  Ratio- 
nem  reddere.  They  will  have  to  explain  matters  to  the  pro- 
consul. Sustrophe  (from  sun,  together,  strepho,  to  turn) 
is  a  late  word  for  a  conspiracy  (Acts  23:12)  and  a  disorderly 
riot  as  here  (Polybius).  In  Acts  28:12  sustrepho  is  used  of 
gathering  up  a  bundle  of  sticks  and  of  men  combining  in 
Matt.  17:22.  Seneca  says  that  there  was  nothing  on  which 
the  Romans  looked  with  such  jealousy  as  a  tumultuous 
meeting. 

41.  Dismissed  the  assembly  [apelusen  ten  ekklesian).  The 
town-clerk  thus  gave  a  semblance  of  law  and  order  to  the 
mob  by  formally  dismissing  them,  this  much  to  protect 
them  against  the  charge  to  which  they  were  liable.  This 
vivid,  graphic  picture  given  by  Luke  has  all  the  earmarks 
of  historical  accuracy.  Paul  does  not  describe  the  incidents 
in  his  letters,  was  not  in  the  theatre  in  fact,  but  Luke  ev- 
idently obtained  the  details  from  one  who  was  there.  Aris- 
tarchus,  we  know,  was  with  Luke  in  Caesarea  and  in  Rome 
and  could  have  supplied  all  the  data  necessary.  Certainly 
both  Gaius  and  Aristarchus  were  lively  witnesses  of  these 
events  since  their  own  lives  were  involved. 


CHAPTER  XX 

1.  After  the  uproar  was  ceased  (meta  to  pausasthai  ton 
thorubon).  Literally,  after  the  ceasing  (accusative  of  artic- 
ular aorist  middle  infinitive  of  paud^  to  make  cease)  as  to  the 
uproar  (accusative  of  general  reference).  Noise  and  riot,  al- 
ready in  Matt.  26:5;  27:24;  Mark  5:38;  14:2;  and  see  in 
Acts  21 :34;  24:18.  Pictures  the  whole  incident  as  bustle  and 
confusion.  Took  leave  (aspamenos) .  First  aorist  middle 
participle  of  aspazomai,  old  verb  from  a  intensive  and  spaOj 
to  draw,  to  draw  to  oneself  in  embrace  either  in  greeting  or 
farewell.  Here  it  is  in  farewell  as  in  21 :6.  Salutation  in  21 :/, 
19.  Departed  for  to  go  into  Macedonia  {exelthen  poreuesthai 
eis  Makedonian).  Both  verbs,  single  act  and  then  process. 
Luke  here  condenses  what  was  probably  a  whole  year  of 
Paul's  life  and  work  as  we  gather  from  H  Corinthians,  one 
of  Paul's  "weighty  and  powerful"  letters  as  his  enemies 
called  them  (H  Cor.  10:10).  "This  epistle  more  than  any 
other  is  a  revelation  of  S.  Paul's  own  heart:  it  is  his  spiritual 
autobiography  and  apologia  pro  vita  sua^ 

2.  Those  parts  {ta  mere  ekeina).  We  have  no  way  of  know- 
ing why  Luke  did  not  tell  of  Paul's  stay  in  Troas  (H  Cor. 
2:i2f.)  nor  of  meeting  Titus  in  Macedonia  (H  Cor.  2:13  to 
7:16)  nor  of  Paul's  visit  to  Illyricum  (Rom.  I5:i9f.)  to  give 
time  for  H  Corinthians  to  do  its  work  (H  Cor.  13),  one  of 
the  most  stirring  experiences  in  Paul's  whole  career  when 
he  opened  his  heart  to  the  Corinthians  and  won  final  victory 
in  the  church  by  the  help  of  Titus  who  also  helped  him 
round  up  the  great  collection  in  Achaia.  He  wrote  H  Corin- 
thians during  this  period  after  Titus  arrived  from  Corinth. 
The  unity  of  H  Corinthians  is  here  assumed.  Paul  probably 
met  Luke  again  in  Macedonia,  but  all  this  is  passed  by 

335 


336      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

except  by  the  general  phrase:  "had  given  them  much  exhor- 
tation" {parakalesas  autous  logbi  polloi).  Literally,  "having 
exhorted  them  (the  Macedonian  brethren)  with  much  talk" 
(instrumental  case).  Into  Greece  (eis  ten  Hellada).  That  is, 
Achaia  (18:12;  19:21),  and  particularly  Corinth,  whither 
he  had  at  last  come  again  after  repeated  attempts,  pauses, 
and  delays  (II  Cor.  13:1).  Now  at  last  the  coast  was  clear 
and  Paul  apparently  had  an  open  door  in  Corinth  during 
these  three  months,  so  completely  had  Titus  at  last  done 
away  with  the  opposition  of  the  Judaizers  there. 

3.  When  he  had  spent  three  months  there  (poiesas  menas 
treis).  Literally,  "having  done  three  months," the  same  idiom 
in  Acts  14:33;  18:23;  James  5:13.  During  this  period  Paul 
may  have  written  Galatians  as  Lightfoot  argued  and  certainly 
did  Romans.  We  do  not  have  to  say  that  Luke  was  ignorant 
of  Paul's  work  during  this  period,  only  that  he  did  not 
choose  to  enlarge  upon  it.  And  a  plot  was  laid  against  him 
by  the  Jews  (genomenes  epiboules  autoi  hupo  ton  loudaion). 
Genitive  absolute,  "a  plot  by  the  Jews  having  come  against 
him."  Epiboule  is  an  old  word  for  a  plot  against  one.  In 
the  N.T.  only  in  Acts  (9:24;  20:3,  19;  23:30).  Please  note 
that  this  plot  is  by  the  Jews,  not  the  Judaizers  whom  Paul 
discusses  so  vehemently  in  II  Cor.  10-13.  They  had  given 
Paul  much  anguish  of  heart  as  is  shown  in  I  Cor.  and  in  II 
Cor.  1-7,  but  that  trouble  seems  now  past.  It  is  Paul's  old 
enemies  in  Corinth  who  had  cherished  all  these  years  their 
defeat  at  the  hands  of  Gallio  (Acts  18:5-17)  who  now  took 
advantage  of  Paul's  plans  for  departure  to  compass  his 
death  if  possible.  As  he  was  about  to  set  sail  for  Syria  (mel- 
lonti  anagesthai  eis  ten  Surian).  The  participle  mellonti 
agrees  in  case  (dative)  with  autoi.  For  the  sense  of  intending 
see  also  verse  13.  Anagesthai  (present  middle  infinitive) 
is  the  common  word  for  putting  out  to  sea  (going  up,  they 
said,  from  land)  as  in  13:13.  He  determined  (egeneto  gnomes). 
The   best   MSS.   here   read   gnomes   (predicate   ablative   of 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  337 

source  like  epiluseos,  II  Peter  i  :20,  Robertson,  Grammar^ 
p.  514),  not  gnome  (nominative).  "He  became  of  opinion." 
The  Jews  had  heard  of  Paul's  plan  to  sail  for  Syria  and  in- 
tended in  the  hurly-burly  either  to  kill  him  at  the  docks  in 
Cenchreae  or  to  push  him  overboard  from  the  crowded 
pilgrim  ship  bound  for  the  passover.  Fortunately  Paul 
learned  of  their  plot  and  so  eluded  them  by  going  through 
Macedonia.  The  Codex  Bezae  adds  here  that  "the  Spirit 
bade  him  return  into  Macedonia." 

4.  Accompanied  him  (suneipeto  autoi).  Imperfect  of  sun- 
epomai,  old  and  common  verb,  but  only  here  in  the  N.T. 
The  singular  is  used  agreeing  with  the  first  name  men- 
tioned Sopatros  and  to  be  supplied  with  each  of  the  others. 
Textus  Receptus  adds  here  "into  Asia"  (achri  tes  Asias^ 
as  far  as  Asia),  but  the  best  documents  (Aleph  B  Vulg.  Sah 
Boh)  do  not  have  it.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  Trophimus  went 
as  far  as  Jerusalem  (Acts  21:29)  ^^'^  Aristarchus  as  far  as 
Rome  (27:2;  Col.  4:10).  The  phrase  could  apply  only  to 
Sopatros.  It  is  not  clear  though  probable  that  Luke  means 
to  say  that  these  seven  brethren,  delegates  of  the  various 
churches  (II  Cor.  8:19-23)  started  from  Corinth  with  Paul. 
Luke  notes  the  fact  that  they  accompanied  Paul,  but  the 
party  may  really  have  been  made  up  at  Philippi  where  Luke 
himself  joined  Paul,  the  rest  of  the  party  having  gone 
on  to  Troas  (20:5f.).  These  were  from  Roman  provinces 
that  shared  in  the  collection  (Galatia,  Asia,  Macedonia, 
Achaia).  In  this  list  three  were  from  Macedonia,  Sopater 
of  Beroea,  Aristarchus  and  Secundus  of  Thessalonica;  two 
from  Galatia,  Gains  of  Derbe  and  Timothy  of  Lystra;  two 
from  Asia,  Tychicus  and  Trophimus.  It  is  a  bit  curious  that 
none  are  named  from  Achaia.  Had  Corinth  failed  after  all 
(II  Cor.  8,  9)  to  raise  its  share  of  the  collection  after  such 
eager  pledging.^  Rackham  suggests  that  they  may  have 
turned  their  part  over  directly  to  Paul.  Luke  joined  Paul 
in  Philippi  and  could  have  handled  the  money  from  Achaia.

It  was  an  important  event  and  Paul  took  the  utmost  pains 
to  remove  any  opportunity  for  scandal  in  the  handling 
of  the  funds. 

5.  fFere  waiting  for  us  in  Troas  {emenon  hemds  en  Troiadi). 
Here  again  we  have  "us"  for  the  first  time  since  chapter  16 
where  Paul  was  with  Luke  in  Philippi.  Had  Luke  remained 
all  this  time  in  Philippi?  We  do  not  know,  but  he  is  with 
Paul  now  till  Rome  is  reached.  The  seven  brethren  of  verse 
4  went  on  ahead  from  Philippi  to  Troas  while  Paul  remained 
with  Luke  in  Philippi. 

6.  After  the  days  of  unleavened  bread  {meta  tas  hemeras  ton 
azumon).  Paul  was  a  Jew,  though  a  Christian,  and  observed 
the  Jewish  feasts,  though  he  protested  against  Gentiles  being 
forced  to  do  it  (Gal.  4:10;  Col.  2:16).  Was  Luke  a  proselyte 
because  he  notes  the  Jewish  feasts  as  here  and  in  Acts  27:9.' 
He  may  have  noted  them  merely  because  Paul  observed 
them.  But  this  passover  was  a  year  after  that  in  Ephesus 
when  Paul  expected  to  remain  there  till  Pentecost  (I  Cor. 
16:  8).  He  was  hoping  now  to  reach  Jerusalem  by  Pentecost 
(Acts  20:16)  as  he  did.  We  do  not  know  the  precise  year, 
possibly  A.D.  56  or  57.  In  five  days  {achri  hemeron  pente). 
Up  to  five  days  (cf.  Luke  2:37).  D  has  pemptaioi^  "fifth  day 
men,"  a  correct  gloss.  Cf.  deuteraioi,  second-day  men  (Acts 
28:13).  ^^  Acts  16:11  they  made  the  voyage  in  two  days. 
Probably  adverse  winds  held  them  back  here.  Seven  days 
{hepta  hemeras).  To  atone  for  the  short  stay  in  Troas  be- 
fore (II  Cor.  2:i2f.)  when  Paul  was  so  restless.  Now  he 
preaches  a  week  to  them. 

7.  Upon  the  first  day  of  the  week  {en  de  midi  ton  sabbaton). 
The  cardinal  midi  used  here  for  the  ordinal  protei  (Mark 
16:9)  like  the  Hebrew  ehadh  as  in  Mark  16:2;  Matt.  28:1; 
Luke  24:1;  John  20:1  and  in  harmony  with  the  Koine  idiom 
(Robertson,  Grammar^  p.  671).  Either  the  singular  (Mark 
16 :ci)sabbatou  or  the  plural  sabbaton  as  here  was  used  for  the 
week  (sabbath  to  sabbath).   For  the  first  time  here  we  have 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  339 

services  mentioned  on  the  first  day  of  the  week  though  in 
I  Cor.  16:2  it  is  implied  by  the  collections  stored  on  that 
day.  In  Rev.  1:10  the  Lord's  day  seems  to  be  the  day  of 
the  week  on  which  Jesus  rose  from  the  grave.  Worship  on 
the  first  day  of  the  week  instead  of  the  seventh  naturally 
arose  in  Gentile  churches,  though  John  20:26  seems  to  mean 
that  from  the  very  start  the  disciples  began  to  meet  on  the 
first  (or  eighth)  day.  But  liberty  was  allowed  as  Paul  makes 
plain  in  Rom.  I4:5f.  When  we  were  gathered  together  {sun- 
egmenon  hemon).  Genitive  absolute,  perfect  passive  parti- 
ciple of  sunagOj  to  gather  together,  a  formal  meeting  of  the 
disciples.  See  this  verb  used  for  gatherings  of  disciples  in 
Acts  4:31;  11:26;  14:2^;  15:6,  30;  19:7,  8;  I  Cor.  5^..  InHeb. 
10:25  the  substantive  episunagogen  is  used  for  the  regular 
gatherings  which  some  were  already  neglecting.  It  is  im- 
possible for  a  church  to  flourish  without  regular  meetings 
even  if  they  have  to  meet  in  the  catacombs  as  became  neces- 
sary in  Rome.  In  Russia  today  the  Soviets  are  trying  to 
break  up  conventicles  of  Baptists.  They  probably  met  on 
our  Saturday  evening,  the  beginning  of  the  first  day  at  sun- 
set. So  these  Christians  began  the  day  (Sunday)  with  wor- 
ship. But,  since  this  is  a  Gentile  community,  it  is  quite 
possible  that  Luke  means  our  Sunday  evening  as  the  time 
when  this  meeting  occurs,  and  the  language  in  John  20:19 
"it  being  evening  on  that  day  the  first  day  of  the  week" 
naturally  means  the  evening  following  the  day,  not  the 
evening  preceding  the  day.  To  break  bread  (klasai  arton). 
First  aorist  active  infinitive  of  purpose  of  klao.  The  language 
naturally  bears  the  same  meaning  as  in  2:42,  the  Eucharist 
or  the  Lord's  Supper  which  usually  followed  the  Agape.  See 
I  Cor.  10:16.  The  time  came,  when  the  Agape  was  no  longer 
observed,  perhaps  because  of  the  abuses  noted  in  I  Cor. 
ii:2ofF.  Rackham  argues  that  the  absence  of  the  article 
with  bread  here  and  its  presence  {ton  arton)  in  verse  1 1  shows 
that  the  Agape  is  referred  to  in  verse  7  and  the  Eucharist 


340      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

in  verse  ii,  but  not  necessarily  so  because  ton  arton  may 
merely  refer  to  arton  in  verse  7.  At  any  rate  it  should  be 
noted  that  Paul,  who  conducted  this  service,  was  not  a 
member  of  the  church  in  Troas,  but  only  a  visitor.  Discour- 
sed (dielegeto).  Imperfect  middle  because  he  kept  on  at 
length.  Intending  (mello).  Being  about  to,  on  the  point  of. 
On  the  morrow  {tei  epaurion).  Locative  case  with  hemerdi 
understood  after  the  adverb  epaurion.  If  Paul  spoke  on  our 
Saturday  evening,  he  made  the  journey  on  the  first  day 
of  the  week  (our  Sunday)  after  sunrise.  If  he  spoke  on  our 
Sunday  evening,  then  he  left  on  our  Monday  morning.  Pro- 
longed his  speech  {Pareteinen  ton  logon).  Imperfect  active 
(same  form  as  aorist)  of  parateinOy  old  verb  to  stretch  beside 
or  lengthwise,  to  prolong.  Vivid  picture  of  Paul's  long  ser- 
mon which  went  on  and  on  till  midnight  {mechri  mesonuk- 
tiou).  Paul's  purpose  to  leave  early  next  morning  seemed  to 
justify  the  long  discourse.  Preachers  usually  have  some 
excuse  for  the  long  sermon  which  is  not  always  clear  to  the 
exhausted  audience. 

8.  Many  lights  {lampades  hikanai).  It  was  dark  at  night 
since  the  full  moon  (passover)  was  three  weeks  behind. 
These  lamps  were  probably  filled  with  oil  and  had  wicks  that 
flickered  and  smoked.  They  would  not  meet  in  the  dark. 
In  the  upper  room  {en  tbi  huperbibi).   As  in  1:13  which  see. 

9.  Sat  (kathezomenos) .  Sitting  (present  middle  participle 
describing  his  posture).  In  the  window  {epi  tes  thuridos). 
Old  word  diminutive  from  thura,  door,  a  little  door.  Lat- 
ticed window  (no  glass)  opened  because  of  the  heat  from 
the  lamps  and  the  crowd.  Our  window  was  once  spelt 
windore  (Hudibras),  perhaps  from  the  wrong  idea  that  it  was 
derived  from  wind  and  door.  Eutychus  (a  common  slave 
name)  was  sitting  on  (epi)  the  window  sill.  Ahaziah  "fell 
down  through  a  lattice  in  his  upper  chamber"  (II  Kings  i  :2). 
In  the  N.T.  thuris  only  here  and  II  Cor.  11 133  {dia  thuridos)

THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  341 

Damascus.  Borne  down  with  deep  sleep  {katapheromenos 
hupnoi  bathei).  Present  passive  participle  of  kataphero, 
to  bear  down,  and  followed  by  instrumental  case 
(hupnoi).  Describes  the  gradual  process  of  going  into  deep 
sleep.  Great  medical  writers  use  bathus  with  hupnos  as  we 
do  today  (deep  sleep).  D  here  has  basei  (heavy)  for  bathei 
(deep).  As  Paul  discoursed  yet  longer  {dialegomenou  tou 
Paulou  epi  pleion).  Genitive  absolute  of  present  middle 
participle  of  dialegomai  (cf.  verse  7).  with  epi  pleion.  Euty- 
chus  struggled  bravely  to  keep  awake,  vainly  hoping  that 
Paul  would  finish.  But  he  went  on  "for  more."  Being  borne 
down  by  his  sleep  {katenechtheis  apo  tou  hupnou).  First  aorist 
(effective)  passive  showing  the  final  result  of  the  process 
described  by  katapheromenos y  finally  overcome  as  a  result  of 
{apo)  the  (note  article  tou)  sleep  (ablative  case).  These 
four  participles  (kathezomenos,  katapheromenos j  dialegomenou, 
katenechtheis)  have  no  connectives,  but  are  distinguished 
clearly  by  case  and  tense.  The  difference  between  the 
present  katapheromenos  and  the  aorist  katenechtheis  of  the 
same  verb  is  marked.  Fell  down  (epesen  koto).  Effective 
aorist  active  indicative  of  pipto  with  the  adverb  kato,  though 
katapipto  (compound  verb)  could  have  been  used  (Acts  26: 
14;  28:6).  Hobart  {Medical  Language  of  St.  Luke)  thinks 
that  Luke  shows  a  physician's  interest  in  the  causes  of  the 
drowsiness  of  Eutychus  (the  heat,  the  crowd,  the  smell  of 
the  lamps,  the  late  hour,  the  long  discourse).  Cf.  Luke 
22:45.  Ffom  the  third  story  {apo  tou  tristegou).  From  treis 
(three)  and  stege  (roof),  adjective  tristegos  having  three 
roofs.  fFas  taken  up  dead  {erthe  nekros).  First  aorist  passive 
indicative  of  airb.  Luke  does  not  say  hbs  (as)  or  hbsei  (Mark 
9:26  as  if).  The  people  considered  him  dead  and  Luke  the 
physician  seems  to  agree  with  that  view. 

10.  Fell  on  him  {epepesen  autbi).  Second  aorist  active  in- 
dicative of  epipipto  with  dative  case  as  Elijah  did  (I  Kings 
17:21)  and  Elisha  (II  Kings  4:34).  Embracing  {sunperilabbn). 


342      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Second  aorist  active  participle  of  sunperilambano,  old  verb 
to  embrace  completely  (take  hold  together  round),  but 
only  here  in  the  N.T.  In  Ezra  5:3.  Make  ye  no  ado  {me 
thoruheisthe).  Stop  {me  and  present  middle  imperative  of 
thorubeo)  making  a  noise  {thorubos)  as  the  people  did  on  the 
death  of  Jairus's  daughter  (Matt.  9:23  thoruboumenou  and 
Mark  5:38  thorubou)  when  Jesus  asked  Ti  thorubeisthe?  For 
his  life  is  in  him  {he  gar  psuche  autou  en  autoi  estin).  This 
language  is  relied  on  by  Ramsay,  Wendt,  Zoeckler  to  show 
that  Eutychus  had  not  really  died,  but  had  merely  swooned. 
Paul's  language  would  suit  that  view,  but  it  suits  equally  well 
the  idea  that  he  had  just  been  restored  to  life  and  so  is  in- 
decisive. Furneaux  urges  also  the  fact  that  his  friends  did 
not  bring  him  back  to  the  meeting  till  morning  (verse  12) 
as  additional  evidence  that  it  was  a  case  of  swooning  rather 
than  of  death.  But  this  again  is  not  conclusive  as  they  would 
naturally  not  take  him  back  at  once.  One  will  believe  here 
as  the  facts  appeal  to  him. 

II.  When  he  was  gone  up  {anabas).  Second  aorist  active 
participle  in  sharp  contrast  to  katabas  (went  down)  of  verse 
10,  Had  broken  bread  {klasas  ton  arton).  Probably  the 
Eucharist  to  observe  which  ordinance  Paul  had  come  and 
tarried  (verse  7),  though  some  scholars  distinguish  between 
what  took  place  in  verse  7  and  verse  11,  needlessly  so  as  was 
stated  on  verse  7.  And  eaten  {kai  geusamenos).  The  word  is 
used  in  10:10  of  eating  an  ordinary  meal  and  so  might  apply 
to  the  Agape,  but  it  suits  equally  for  the  Eucharist.  The 
accident  had  interrupted  Paul's  sermon  so  that  it  was  ob- 
served now  and  then  Paul  resumed  his  discourse.  And  had 
talked  with  them  a  long  while  {epW  hikanon  te  homilesas). 
Luke,  as  we  have  seen,  is  fond  of  hikanos  for  periods  of  time, 
for  a  considerable  space  of  time,  "even  till  break  of  day" 
{achri  auges).  Old  word  for  brightness,  radiance  like  German 
Auge,  English  eye:,  only  here  in  the  N.T.  Occurs  in  the 
papyri  and  in  modern  Greek  for  dawn.  This  second  discourse 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  343 

lasted  from  midnight  till  dawn  and  was  probably  more  in- 
fonnal  (as  in  10:27)  and  conversational  {homilesas,  though 
our  word  homiletics  comes  from  homileo)  than  the  discourse 
before  midnight  {dialegomaij  verses  7,  9).  He  had  much  to 
say  before  he  left.  So  he  departed  {houtos  exelthen).  Thus 
Luke  sums  up  the  result.  Paul  left  (went  forth)  only  after 
all  the  events  narrated  by  the  numerous  preceding  participles 
had  taken  place.  Effective  aorist  active  indicative  exelthen. 
Houtos  here  equals  turn  demum,  now  at  length  (Acts  27:7)  as 
Page  shows. 

12.  They  brought  the  lad  alive  (egagon  ton  paida  zonta). 
Second  aorist  active  indicative  of  ago.  Evidently  the  special 
friends  of  the  lad  who  now  either  brought  him  back  to  the 
room  or  (Rendall)  took  him  home  to  his  family.  Knowling 
holds  that  zonta  (living)  here  is  pointless  unless  he  had  been 
dead.  He  had  been  taken  up  dead  and  now  they  brought 
him  living.  Not  a  little  (ou  metrios).  Not  moderately,  that 
is  a  great  deal.  Luke  is  fond  of  this  use  of  the  figure  litotes 
(use  of  the  negative)  instead  of  the  strong  positive  (i  15,  etc.). 
D  (Codex  Bezae)  has  here  instead  of  egagon  these  words: 
aspazomenon  de  auton  egagen  ton  neaniskon  zonta  (while 
they  were  saying  farewell  he  brought  the  young  man  alive). 
This  reading  pictures  the  joyful  scene  over  the  lad's  restora- 
tion as  Paul  was  leaving. 

13.  To  the  ship  {epi  to  ploion).  Note  article.  It  is  possible 
that  Paul's  party  had  chartered  a  coasting  vessel  from 
Philippi  or  Troas  to  take  them  to  Patara  in  Lycia.  Hence  the 
boat  stopped  when  and  where  Paul  wished.  That  is  possible, 
but  not  certain,  for  Paul  could  simply  have  accommodated 
himself  to  the  plans  of  the  ship's  managers.  To  take  in  Paul 
{analambanein  ton  Paulon).  So  in  verse  14.  Same  use  in  \\ 
Tim.  4:11:  "Picking  up  Mark"  {Markon  analahon).  Assos 
was  a  seaport  south  of  Troas  in  Mysia  in  the  province  of 
Asia.  He  had  appointed  {diatetagmenos  en).  Past  perfect 
periphrastic   middle   of  diatasso,   old   verb   to  give   orders 


344     WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

(military  in  particular).  To  go  by  land  {pezeuein).  Present 
active  infinitive  of  pezeuo,  old  verb  to  go  on  foot,  not  on 
horse  back  or  in  a  carriage  or  by  ship.  Here  only  in  the  N.T. 
It  was  about  twenty  miles  over  a  paved  Roman  road,  much 
shorter  (less  than  half)  than  the  sea  voyage  around  Cape 
Lectum.  It  was  a  beautiful  walk  in  the  spring-time  and  no 
doubt  Paul  enjoyed  it  whatever  his  reason  was  for  going  thus 
to  Assos  while  the  rest  went  by  sea.  Certainly  he  was  en- 
titled to  a  little  time  alone,  this  one  day,  as  Jesus  sought 
the  Father  in  the  night  watches  (Matt.  14:23). 

14.  Met  us  {suneballen  hemin).  Imperfect  active  where  the 
aorist  {sunebalen,  as  C  D  have  it)  would  seem  more  natural. 
It  may  mean  that  as  soon  as  (hos)  Paul  "came  near  or  began 
to  meet  us"  (inchoative  imperfect),  we  picked  him  up.  Luke 
alone  in  the  N.T.  uses  sunballb  to  bring  or  come  together 
either  in  a  friendly  sense  as  here  or  as  enemies  (Luke  14:31). 
To  Mitylene  {eis  Mitulenen).  The  capital  of  Lesbos  about 
thirty  miles  from  Assos,  an  easy  day's  sailing. 

15.  We  came  over  against  Chios  {katentesamen  antikrus 
Chiou).  Luke  uses  this  Koine  verb  several  times  (16:1; 
18:19),  meaning  to  come  right  down  in  front  of  and  the 
notion  of  anta  is  made  plainer  by  antikrus,  face  to  face  with, 
common  "improper"  preposition  only  here  in  the  N.T. 
They  probably  lay  off  the  coast  (anchoring)  during  the 
night  instead  of  putting  into  the  harbour.  The  Island  of 
Chios  is  about  eight  miles  from  the  mainland.  The  next  day 
(tei  heterdi).  The  third  day  in  reality  from  Assos  (the  fourth 
from  Troas),  in  contrast  with  tei  epiousei  just  before  for 
Chios.  fVe  touched  at  Samos  {parebalomen  eis  Samon).  Second 
aorist  active  of  paraballo,  to  throw  alongside,  to  cross  over, 
to  put  in  by.  So  Thucydides  III.  32.  Only  here  in  the  N.T. 
though  in  Textus  Receptus  in  Mark  4:30.  The  word  parable 
(parabole)  is  from  this  verb.  The  Textus  Receptus  adds  here 
kai  meinantes  en  Trogullioi  (and  remaining  at  Trogyllium), 
but  clearly  not  genuine.    In  passing  from  Chios  to  Samos 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  345 

they  sailed  past  Ephesus  to  save  time  for  Pentecost  in 
Jerusalem  (verse  16),  if  in  control  of  the  ship,  or  because 
the  captain  allowed  Paul  to  have  his  way.  The  island  of 
Samos  is  still  further  down  the  coast  below  Chios.  It  is  not 
stated  whether  a  stop  was  made  here  or  not.  The  day  after 
(tei  echomenei) .  The  day  holding  itself  next  to  the  one  be- 
fore. Note  Luke's  three  terms  in  this  verse  {iei  epiousei, 
tei  heterdi,  tei  echomenei) .  This  would  be  the  fourth  from 
Assos.  To  Miletus  {eis  Mileton).  About  28  miles  south  of 
Ephesus  and  now  the  site  is  several  miles  from  the  sea  due 
to  the  silt  from  the  Maeander.  This  city,  once  the  chief 
city  of  the  Ionian  Greeks,  was  now  quite  eclipsed  by  Ephe- 
sus. 

16.  For  Paul  had  determined  {kekrikei  gar  ho  Paulos). 
Past  perfect  active  (correct  text)  of  krino  and  not  the 
aorist  ekrine.  Either  Paul  controlled  the  ship  or  the  captain 
was  willing  to  oblige  him.  To  sail  past  Ephesus  {parapleusai 
ten  Epheson).  First  aorist  active  infinitive  of  parapled,  old 
verb  to  sail  beside,  only  here  in  the  N.T.  That  he  might  not 
have  {hop  OS  me  genetai  autbi).  Final  clause  (negative)  with 
aorist  middle  subjunctive  of  ginomai  and  dative  "that  it 
might  not  happen  to  him."  To  spend  time  (chronotribesai). 
First  aorist  active  of  the  late  compound  verb  chronotribeo 
{chronos,  time,  tribo,  to  spend),  only  here  in  the  N.T.  The 
verb  tribo,  to  rub,  to  wear  out  by  rubbing,  lends  itself  to  the 
idea  of  wasting  time.  It  was  only  a  year  ago  that  Paul  had 
left  Ephesus  in  haste  after  the  riot.  It  was  not  expedient 
to  go  back  so  soon  if  he  meant  to  reach  Jerusalem  by  Pente- 
cost. Paul  clearly  felt  (Rom.  15)  that  the  presentation  of 
this  collection  at  Pentecost  to  the  Jewish  Christians  would 
have  a  wholesome  influence  as  it  had  done  once  before 
(Acts  II  :3o).  He  was  hastening  (espeuden).  Imperfect  active 
of  speudo,  old  verb  to  hasten  as  in  Luke  2:16;  19:56.  //  it

him.  The  form  is  a  remote  possibility.  It  was  only  some 
thirty  days  till  Pentecost.  The  day  of  Pentecost  {ten  hemeran 
tes  pentekostes).  Note  the  accusative  case.  Paul  wanted  to 
be  there  for  the  whole  -day.  See  Acts  2:1  for  this  very  phrase. 
17.  Called  to  him  (metekalesato).  Aorist  middle  (indirect) 
indicative  of  metakaleo,  old  verb  to  call  from  one  place  to 
another  (meta  for  "change"),  middle  to  call  to  oneself,  only 
in  Acts  in  the  N.T.  (7:14;  10:32;  20:17;  24:25).  Ephesus  was 
1/  some  thirty  miles,  a  stiff  day's  journey  each  way.  They 
would  be  with  Paul  the  third  day  of  the  stay  in  Miletus. 
The  elders  of  the  church  {tous  preshuterous  tes  ekklesias).  The 
very  men  whom  Paul  terms  "bishops"  (episkopous)  in 
I  verse  28  just  as  in  Titus  i  :5  and  7  where  both  terms  (presbu- 
j  terous,  ton  episkopon)  describe  the  same  office.  The  term 
"elder"  applied  to  Christian  ministers  first  appears  in 
Acts  11:30  in  Jerusalem  and  reappears  in  154,  6,  22  in 
connection  with  the  apostles  and  the  church.  The  "elders" 
are  not  "apostles"  but  are  "bishops"  (cf.  Phil.  1:1)  and 
with  "deacons"  constitute  the  two  classes  of  officers  in  the 
early  churches.  Ignatius  shows  that  in  the  early  second 
century  the  office  of  bishop  over_the  elders  had  developed, 
but  Lightfoot  has  shown  that  it  was  not  so  in  the  first  cen- 
tury. Each  church,  as  in  Jerusalem,  Philippi,  Ephesus, 
had  a  number  of  "elders"  ("bishops")  in  the  one  great 
city  church.  Hackett  thinks  that  other  ministers  from  the 
neighbourhood  also  came.  It  was  a  noble  group  of  preachers 
and  Paul,  the  greatest  preacher  of  the  ages,  makes  a  remark- 
able talk  to  preachers  with  all  the  earmarks  of  Pauline 
originality  (Spitta,  Apostelgeschichte^  p.  252)  as  shown  by  the 
characteristic  Pauline  words,  phrases,  ideas  current  in  all 
his  Epistles  including  the  Pastoral  (testify,  course,  pure, 
take  heed,  presbyter,  bishop,  acquire,  apparel).  Luke  heard 
this  address  as  he  may  and  probably  did  hear  those  in 
Jerusalem  and  Caesarea  (Acts  21  to  26).  Furneaux  suggests 
that  Luke  probably  took  shorthand  notes  of  the  address 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  347 

since  Galen  says  that  his  students  took  down  his  medical 
lectures  in  shorthand:  "At  any  rate,  of  all  the  speeches  in 
the  Acts  this  contains  most  of  Paul  and  least  of  Luke.  .  .  . 
It  reveals  Paul  as  nothing  else  does.  The  man  who  spoke 
it  is  no  longer  a  man  of  eighteen  centuries  ago:  he  is  of  yester- 
day; of  today.  He  speaks  as  we  speak  and  feels  as  wejeel; 
or  rather  as  we  fain  would  speak  and  feel."  We  have  seen 
and  listened  to  Paul  speak  to  the  Jews  in  Antioch  in  Pisidia 
as  Luke  pictures  the  scene,  to  the  uneducated  pagans  at 
Lystra,  to  the  cultured  Greeks  in  Athens.  We  shall  hear 
him  plead  for  his  life  to  the  Jewish  mob  in  Jerusalem,  to 
the  Roman  governor  Felix  in  Caesarea,  to  the  Jewish  "King" 
Herod  Agrippa  H  in  Caesarea,  and  at  last  to  the  Jews  in 
Rome.  But__here  Pan!  nnhnsnms  himself  to  the  ministers 
of  the  church  in  Ephesus  where  he  had  spent  three  years 
(longer  than  with  any  other  church)  and  where  he  had  such 
varied  experiences  of  prowess  and  persecution.  He  opens 
his  heart  to  these  men  as  he  does  not  to  the  average  crowd 
even  of  believers.  It  is  Paul's  Apologia  pro  sua  Vita.  He  will 
probably  not  see  them  again  and  so  the  outlook  and  attitude 
is  similar  to  the  farewell  discourse  of  Tesus  to  the  disciples 
in  the  upper  room  (John  13-17).  He  warns  them  about 
future  perils  as  Jesus  had  done.  Paul's  words  here  will  repay 
any  preacher's  study  today.  There  is  the  same  high  concep- 
tion of  the  ministry  here  that  Paul  had  already  elaborated 
in  II  Cor.  2:12-6:10  (see  my  Glory  of  the  Ministry).  It  is  a 
fitting  time  and  occasion  for  Paul  to  take  stock  of  his 
ministry  at  the  close  of  the  third  mission  tour.  What  wonders 
had  God  wrought  already. 

18.  Ye  yourselves  know  {humeis  epistasthe).  Pronoun  ex- 
pressed and  emphatic.  He  appeals  to  their  person  a  I  knowl- 
edge  of  his  life  in  Ephesus.  From  the  first  day  that  {apo  protes 
hemeras  aph^  hes).  "From  first  day  from  which."  He  had

old  verb  epibaino,  to  step  upon  or  step  into)  in  Ephesus  four

years  ago  in  the  spring  of  51  or  52,  but  had  returned  from 
Antioch  that  autumn.  It  is  now  spring  of  54  or  55  so  that 
his  actual  ministry  in  Ephesus  was  about  two  and  a  half 
years,  roughly  three  years  (verse  31). 

After  what  manner  I  was  with  you  {pos  meth'  humon 

egenomen).    Literally,  "How  I  came  (from  Asia  and  so  was) 

/  with  you."    Cf.  I  Thess.  1:5  and  II  Thess.  2:1-10  where 

/    Paul  likewise  dares  to  refer  boldly  to  his  life  while  with  them 

/  "all  the  time"  {ton  panta  chronon).  Accusative  of  duration 
of  time.  So  far  as  we  know,  Paul  stuck  to  Ephesus  the  whole 
period.  He  had  devoted  himself  consecratedly  to  the  task 
in  Ephesus.  Each  pastor  is  bishop  of  his  field  and  has  a 
golden  opportunity  to  work  it  for  Christ.  One  of  the  saddest 
things  about  the  present  situation  is  the  restlessness  of 
preachers  to  go  elsewhere  instead  of  devoting  themselves 
wholly  to  the  task  where  they  are.  19.  Serving  the  Lord  [dou- 
leuon  tbi  kuridi).  It  was  Paul's  glory  to  be  the  doulos  (bond- 
slave) as  in  Rom.  1:1;  Phil.  i:i.  Paul  alone,  save  Jesus 
in  Matt.  6:24  and  Luke  16:13,  uses  douleub  six  times  for 
serving  God  (Page).  With  all  lowliness  of  mind  {meta  pases 
tapeinophrosunes) .  Lightfoot  notes  that  heathen  writers  use 
this  word  for  a  grovelling,  abject  state  of  mind,  but  Paul 
follows  Christ  in  using  it  for  humility,  humble-mindedness 
that  should  mark  every  Christian  and  in  particular  the 
preacher.   With  tears  {dakruon).   Construed  with  w^i^a.   Paul 

J  was  a  man  of  the  deepest  emotion  along  with  his  high  intel- 
lectuality. He  mentions  his  tears  again  in  verse  31,  tears  of 
sorrow  and  of  anxiety.  He  refers  to  his  tears  in  writing  the 
sharp  letter  to  the  church  in  Corinth  (II  Cor.  2:4)  and  in 
denouncing  the  sensual  apostates  in  Phil.  3:18.  Adolphe 
Monod  has  a  wonderful  sermon  on  the  tears  of  Paul.  Con- 
sider also  the  tears  of  Jesus.  Trials  which  befell  me  (peiras- 
tnon  ton  sumhanton  moi).  Construed  also  with  meta.  Second 
aorist  active  participle  of  sunbaino,  to  walk  with,  to  go  with, 
to  come  together,  to  happen,  to  befall.     Very  common  in 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  349 

this  sense  in  the  old  Greek  (cf.  Acts  3:10).  By  the  plots  of 
the  Jews  {en  tais  epihoulais  ton  loudaion).  Like  the  plot  {epi- 
boule)  against  him  in  Corinth  (20:3)  as  well  as  the  earlier 
trial  before  Gallio  and  the  attacks  in  Thessalonica.  In  Acts 
19:9  Luke  shows  the  hostile  attitude  of  the  Jews  in  Ephesus 
that  drove  Paul  out  of  the  synagogue  to  the  school  of  Tyran- 
nus.  He  does  not  describe  in  detail  these  "plots"  which  may 
easily  be  imagined  from  Paul's  own  letters  and  may  be  even 
referred  to  in  I  Cor.  4:10;  15:301?.;  16:9;  H  Cor.  1:4-10;  7:5; 
11:23.  I^  fact,  one  has  only  to  dwell  on  the  allusions  in  H 
Cor.  II  to  picture  what  Paul's  life  was  in  Ephesus  during 
these  three  years.  Luke  gives  in  Acts  19  the  outbreak  of 
Demetrius,  but  Paul  had  already  fought  with  "wild-beasts" 
there. 

20.  How  that  I  shrank  not  (hos  ouden  hupesteilamen).  Still 
indirect  discourse  (question)  after  epistasthe  (ye  know)  with 
hos  Hke  pos  in  verse  18.  First  aorist  middle  of  hupostello,  old 
verb  to  draw  under  or  back.  It  was  so  used  of  drawing  back 
or  down  sails  on  a  ship  and,  as  Paul  had  so  recently  been  on 
the  sea,  that  may  be  the  metaphor  here.  But  it  is  not  neces- 
sarily so  as  the  direct  middle  here  makes  good  sense  and  is 
frequent,  to  withdraw  oneself,  to  cowjer^to  shrink,  to  con- 
ceal, to  dissemble  as  in  Hab.  2:4  (Heb.  10:38).  Demosthenes 
so  used  it  to  shrink  from  declaring  out  of  fear  for  others. 
This  open  candour  of  Paul  is  supported  by  his  Epistles  (I 
Thess.  2:4,  II;  II  Cor.  4:2;  Gal.  i:io).  From  declaring  unto 
you  {tou  me  anaggeilai  humin).  Ablative  case  of  the  articular 
first  aorist  active  infinitive  of  anaggellb  with  the  redundant 
negative  after  verbs  of  hindering,  etc.  (Robertson,  Grammary 
p.  1094).  Anything  that  was  profitable  {ton  sumpheronton) . 
Partitive  genitive  after  ouden  of  the  articular  present  active 
participle  of  sumphero,  to  bear  together,  be  profitable. 
Publicly  {demosidi,  adverb)  and  from  house  to  house  {kai  kat* 
oikous).  By  (according  to)  houses.  It  is  worth  noting  that 
this  greatest  of  preachers  preached  from  house  to  house  and 


350      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

did  not  make  his  visits  merely  social  calls.  He  was  doing 
kingdom  business  all  the  while  as  in  the  house  of  Aquila  and 
Priscilla  (I  Cor.  16:19). 

21.  Testifying  (diamarturomenos) .  As  Peter  did  (Acts 
2:40)  where  Luke  uses  this  same  word  thoroughly  Lucan 
and  Pauline.  So  again  in  verses  23  and  24.  Paul  here  as  in 
Rom.  1:16  includes  both  Jews  and  Greeks,  to  the  Jew  first. 
Repentance  toward  God  {ten  eis  theon  metanoian)  and  faith 
toward  our  Lord  Jesus  {kai  pistin  eis  ton  kurion  hemon 
lesoun).  These  two  elements  run  through  the  Epistle  to 
the  Romans  which  Paul  had  recently  written  and  sent  from 
Corinth.  These  two  elements  appear  in  all  Paul's  preaching 
whether  "to  Jews  or  Gentiles,  to  philosophers  at  Athens 
or  to  peasants  at  Lystra,  he  preached  repentance  toward 
God  and  faith  toward  the  Lord  Jesus"  (Knowling). 

22.  Bound  in  the  spirit  {dedemenos  toi  pneumati).  Perfect 
passive  participle  of  deb^  to  bind,  with  the  locative  case. 
"Bound  in  my  spirit"  he  means,  as  in  19:21,  from  a  high 
sense  of  duty.  The  mention  of  "the  Holy  Spirit"  specifically 
in  verse  23  seems  to  be  in  contrast  to  his  own  spirit  here. 
His  own  spirit  was  under  the  control  of  the  Holy  Spirit 
(Rom.  8:16)  and  the  sense  does  not  differ  greatly.  Not  know- 
ing {me  eidos).  Second  perfect  active  participle  of  oida  with 
me.  That  shall  befall  me  {ta  sunantesonta  emoi).  Articular 
future  active  participle  of  sunantad,  to  meet  with  (Acts 
10:25),  to  befall  (with  associative  instrumental  case)  and 
compare  with  sumbanton  (befell)  in  verse  19.  One  of  the 
rare  instances  of  the  future  participle  in  the  N.T. 

23.  Save  that  {plen  hoti).  The  hoti  clause  is  really  in  the 
ablative  case  after  plen^  here  a  preposition  as  in  Phil.  i:l8, 
this  idiom  plen  hoti  occasionally  in  ancient  Greek.  In  every 
city  {kata  polin).  Singular  here  though  plural  in  kaC  oikous 
(verse  20).  Bonds  and  afflictions  {desma  kai  thlipseis).  Both 
together  as  in  Phil.  1:17;  II  Cor.  1:8.  Literal  bonds  and 
actual  pressures.  Abide  me  {me  menousin).  With  the  accusa- 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  351 

tive  as  in  verse  5  (emenon  hemas)  and  nowhere  else  in  the 
N.T. 

24.  But  I  hold  not  my  life  of  any  account  {aW  oudenos  logou 
poioumai  ten  psuchen).  Neat  Greek  idiom,  accusative 
psuchen  and  genitive  logou  and  then  Paul  adds  "dear  unto 
myself"  (timian  emautoi)  in  apposition  with  psuchen  (really 
a  combination  of  two  constructions).  So  that  I  may  accom- 
plish my  course  (hos  teleioso  dromon  mou).  Rather,  "In 
order  that"  (purpose,  not  result).  Aleph  and  B  read  teleioso 
here  (first  aorist  active  subjunctive)  rather  than  teleiosai 
(first  aorist  active  infinitive).  It  is  the  lone  instance  in  the 
N.T.  of  Aoj  as  a  final  particle  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  987). 
Paul  in  Acts  13:25  in  his  sermon  at  Antioch  in  Pisidia  de- 
scribed John  as  fulfilling  his  course  and  in  II  Tim.  4:7  he  will 
say:  "I  have  finished  my  course"  {ton  dromon  teteleka).  He 
will  run  the  race  to  the  end.  Which  I  received  from  the  Lord 
Jesus  {hen  elahon  para  tou  kuriou  lesou).  Of  that  fact  he 
never  had  a  doubt  and  it  was  a  proud  boast  (Gal.  i  :i ;  Rom. 
11:13).  The  gospel  of  the  grace  of  God  {to  euaggelion  tes 
charitos  tou  theou).  To  Paul  the  gospel  consisted  in  the  grace 
of  God.  See  this  word  "grace"  {charis)  in  Romans  and  his 
other  Epistles. 

25.  And  now,  behold  {kai  nun,  idou).  Second  time  and 
solemn  reminder  as  in  verse  22.  /  know  {ego  oida).  Emphasis 
on  ego  which  is  expressed.  Ye  all  {humeis  pantes).  In  very 
emphatic  position  after  the  verb  opsesthe  (shall  see)  and  the 
object  (my  face).  Twice  Paul  will  write  from  Rome  (Phil. 
2:24;  Philemon  22)  the  hope  of  coming  east  again;  but  that 
is  in  the  future,  and  here  Paul  is  expressing  his  personal 
conviction  and  his  fears.  The  Pastoral  Epistles  show  Paul 
did  come  to  Ephesus  again  (I  Tim.  1:3;  3:14;  4:13)  and 
Troas  (II  Tim.  4:13)  and  Miletus  (II  Tim.  4:20).  There 
need  be  no  surprise  that  Paul's  fears  turned  out  otherwise. 
He  had  reason  enough  for  them.  Among  whom  I  went  about 
{en  hois  dielthon).   Apparently  Paul  here  has  in  mind  others 


352      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

beside  the  ministers.   They  represented  the  church  in  Ephe- 
sus  and  the  whole  region  where  Paul  laboured. 

26.  /  testify  (marturomai) .  Elsewhere  in  the  N.T.  only  in 
Paul's  Epistles  (Gal.  5:3;  Eph.  4:17;  I  Thess.  2:12).  It  means 
"I  call  to  witness"  while  martureo  means  "I  bear  witness." 
This  day  {en  tei  semeron  hemerdi).  The  today  day,  the  last 
day  with  you,  our  parting  day.  /  am  pure  from  the  blood  of 
all  men  (katharos  eimi  apo  tou  haimatos  panton).  Paul  was 
sensitive  on  this  point  as  in  Corinth  (Acts  18:6).  It  is  much 
for  any  preacher  to  claim  and  it  ought  to  be  true  of  all.  The 
papyri  also  give  this  use  of  apo  with  the  ablative  rather  than 
the  mere  ablative  after  katharos. 

27.  Paul  here  repeats  the  very  words  and  idioms  used  in 
verse  20,  adding  "the  whole  counsel  of  God"  {pdsan  ten 
boulen  tou  theou).  All  the  counsel  of  God  that  concerned 
Paul's  work  and  nothing  inconsistent  with  the  purpose  of 
God  of  redemption  through  Christ  Jesus  (Page). 

28.  Take  heed  unto  yourselves  {prosechete  heautois).  The 
full  phrase  had  ton  noun,  hold  your  mind  on  yourselves  (or 
other  object  in  the  dative),  as  often  in  old  writers  and  in 
Job  7:17.  But  the  ancients  often  used  the  idiom  with  noun 
understood,  but  not  expressed  as  here  and  Acts  5:35;  Luke 
12:1;  17:3;  21:34;  I  Tim.  1:4;  3:8;  4:13.  Epeche  is  so  used 
in  I  Tim.  4:16.  To  all  the  flock  {panti  toi  poimnidi).  Con- 
tracted form  of  poimenion  =  poimne  (John  10:16)  already 
in  Luke  12:32  and  also  in  Acts  20:29  ^^^  I  P^^-  S'-^j  3- 
Common  in  old  Greek.  Hath  made  (etheto).  Did  make, 
second  aorist  middle  indicative  of  tithemi,  did  appoint. 
Paul  evidently  believed  that  the  Holy  Spirit  calls  and  ap- 
points ministers.  Bishops  {episkopous).  The  same  men 
termed  elders  in  verse  17  which  see.  To  shepherd  {poimai- 
nein).  Present  active  infinitive  of  purpose  of  poimainOy  old 
verb  to  feed  or  tend  the  flock  {poimne,  poimnion),  to  act 
as  shepherd  {poimen).  These  ministers  are  thus  in  Paul's 
speech   called   eiders    (verse    17),   bishops    (verse   28),   and 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  353 

shepherds  (verse  28).  Jesus  had  used  this  very  word  to 
Peter  (John  21  :i6,  twice  boske^  feed,  21 115,  17)  and  Peter  will 
use  it  in  addressing  fellow-elders  (I  Pet.  5 :2)  with  memories, 
no  doubt  of  the  words  of  Jesus  to  him.  The  "elders"  were 
to  watch  over  as  "bishops"  and  "tend  and  feed  as  shep- 
herds" the  flock.  Jesus  is  termed  "the  shepherd  and  bishop 
of  your  souls"  in  I  Peter  2:25  and  "the  great  Shepherd  of 
the  sheep"  in  Heb.  13:20.  Jesus  called  himself  "the  good 
Shepherd"  in  John  10:11.  The  church  of  God  {ten  ekklesian 
tou  theou).  The  correct  text,  not  "the  church  of  the  Lord" 
or  "the  church  of  the  Lord  and  God"  (Robertson,  Introduc- 
tion to  Textual  Criticism  of  the  N.T.,  p.  189).  He  purchased 
(periepoiesato).  First  aorist  middle  of  peripoieo,  old  verb 
to  reserve,  to  preserve  (for  or  by  oneself,  in  the  middle). 
In  the  N.T.  only  in  Luke  17:33;  Acts  20:28;  I  Tim.  3:13. 
The  substantive  peripoiesin  (preservation,  possession)  oc- 
curs in  I  Peter  2:9  ("a  peculiar  people"  =  a  people  for  a  pos- 
session) and  in  Eph.  i  :i^.  With  his  own  blood  {dia  tou  haima- 
tos  tou  idiou).  Through  the  agency  of  (dia)  his  own  blood. 
Whose  blood.?  If  tou  theou  (Aleph  B  Vulg.)  is  correct,  as  it  is, 
then  Jesus  is  here  called  "God"  who  shed  his  own  blood 
for  the  flock.  It  will  not  do  to  say  that  Paul  did  not  call 
Jesus  God,  for  we  have  Rom.  9:5;  Col.  2:9  and  Tit.  2:13 
where  he  does  that  very  thing,  besides  Col.  1:15-20  and 
Phil.  2:5-11. 

29.  After  my  departing  (meta  ten  aphixin  mou).  Not  his 
death,  but  his  departure  from  them.  From  aphikneomai 
and  usually  meant  arrival,  but  departure  in  Herodotus  IX. 
17,  76  as  here.  Grievous  wolves  {lukoi  bareis).  Bareis  is 
heavy,  rapacious,  harsh.  Jesus  had  already  so  described 
false  teachers  who  would  raven  the  fold  (John  10:12). 
Whether  Paul  had  in  mind  the  Judaizers  who  had  given 
him  so  much  trouble  in  Antioch,  Jerusalem,  Galatia,  Corinth 
or  the  Gnostics  the  shadow  of  whose  coming  he  already 
foresaw  is  not  perfectly  clear.     But  it  will  not  be  many

years  before  Epaphras  will  come  to  Rome  from  Colossae 
with  news  of  the  new  peril  there  (Epistle  to  the  Colossians). 
In  writing  to  Timothy  (I  Tim.  i  :2o)  Paul  will  warn  him 
against  some  who  have  already  made  shipwreck  of  their 
faith.  In  Rev.  2:2  John  will  represent  Jesus  as  describing 
false  apostles  in  Ephesus.  Not  sparing  the  flock  {me  pheido- 
menoi  tou  poimniou).  Litotes  again  as  so  often  in  Acts. 
Sparing  the  flock  was  not  the  fashion  of  wolves.  Jesus  sent 
the  seventy  as  lambs  in  the  midst  of  wolves  (Luke  10:3). 
In  the  Sermon  on  the  Mount  Jesus  had  pictured  the  false 
prophets  who  would  come  as  ravening  wolves  in  sheep's 
clothing  (Matt.  7:15). 

30.  From  among  your  own  selves  {ex  humon  auton).  In 
sheep's  clothing  just  as  Jesus  had  foretold.  The  outcome 
fully  justified  Paul's  apprehensions  as  we  see  in  Colossians, 
Ephesians,  I  and  II  Timothy,  Revelation.  False  philosophy, 
immorality,  asceticism  will  lead  some  astray  (Col.  2:8,  18; 
Eph.  4:14;  5:6).  John  will  picture  "antichrists"  who  went 
out  from  us  because  they  were  not  of  us  (I  John  2:i8f.). 
There  is  a  false  optimism  that  is  complacently  blind  as  well 
as  a  despondent  pessimism  that  gives  up  the  fight.  Perverse 
things  {diestrammena).  Perfect  passive  participle  of  dia- 
strephoy  old  verb  to  turn  aside,  twist,  distort  as  in  Acts  13:8 
10.  To  draw  away  {tou  apospdin).  Articular  genitive  present 
active  participle  of  purpose  from  apospao,  old  verb  used 
to  draw  the  sword  (Matt.  26:51),  to  separate  (Luke  22:41; 
Acts  21:1).  The  pity  of  it  is  that  such  leaders  of  dissension 
can  always  gain  a  certain  following.  Paul's  long  residence 
in  Ephesus  enabled  him  to  judge  clearly  of  conditions  there. 

31.  Wherefore  watch  ye  {dio  gregoreite).  Paul  has  con- 
cluded his  defence  of  himself  and  his  warning.  Now  he  ex- 
horts on  the  basis  of  it  {dio)  because  of  which  thing.  The 
very  command  of  Jesus  concerning  the  perils  before  his 
return  as  in  Mark  13:35  {gregoreite) ^  the  very  form  (late 
present   imperative   from   the   second   perfect   egregora  of 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  355 

egriroy  to  arouse).  Stay  awake.  /  ceased  not  to  admonish 
{ouk  epausamen  noutheton).  Participle  describes  Paul,  I 
did  not  cease  admonishing,  night  and  day  {nukta  kai  hem- 
eran,  accusative  of  extent  of  time,  for  three  years  trietian, 
accusative  of  extent  of  time  also).  Noutheton  is  from  nouthe- 
teo,  to  put  sense  into  one.  So  Paul  kept  it  up  with  tears  (verse 
19)  if  so  be  he  could  save  the  Ephesians  from  the  impending 
perils.  Forewarned  is  to  be  forearmed.  Paul  did  his  duty  by 
them. 

32.  And  now  {kai  ta  nun).  Same  phrase  as  in  verses  22  and 
25  save  that  idou  (behold)  is  wanting  and  the  article  ta  occurs 
before  nww,  accusative  of  general  reference.  And  as  to  the 
present  things  (or  situation)  as  in  4:29.  /  commend  (parati- 
themai).  Present  middle  indicative  of  paratithemi,  old  verb 
to  place  beside,  middle,  to  deposit  with  one,  to  interest  as  in 
I  Tim.  1:18;  II  Tim.  2:2.  Paul  can  now  only  do  this,  but 
he  does  it  hopefully.  Cf.  I  Pet.  4:19.  The  word  of  his  grace 
{toi  logbi  tes  charitos  autou).  The  instrumentality  through 
preaching  and  the  Holy  Spirit  employed  by  God.  Cf.  Col. 
4:6;  Eph.  4:29.  Which  is  able  to  build  up  (toi  dunamenoi 
oikodomesai).  God  works  through  the  word  of  his  grace  and 
so  it  is  able  to  build  up  (edify);  a  favourite  Pauline  word  (I 
Cor.  3:10-14;  3:9;  II  Cor.  5:1;  Eph.  2:20-22;  II  Tim.  3:15; 
etc.),  and  James  i  :2i.  The  very  words  "build"  and  "inherit- 
ance  an^ong  the  sanctified"  will  occur  in  Eph.  l:il;  2:30; 
3:18  and  which  some  may  recall  on  reading.  Cf.  Col.  1:12. 
Stephen  in  Acts  7:5  used  the  word  "inheritance"  (klerono- 
mian),  nowhere  else  in  Acts,  but  in  Eph.  1:14,  18;  5:5.  In 
Eph.  I  :i8  the  very  expression  occurs  "his  inheritance  among 
the  saints"  {ten  kleronomian  autou  en  tois  hagiois), 

33.  No  man's  silver  or  gold  or  apparel  {arguriou  e  chrusiou 
e  himatismou  oudenos).  Genitive  case  after  epethumesa.  One 
of  the  slanders  against  Paul  was  that  he  was  raising  this 
collection,  ostensibly  for  the  poor,  really  for  himself  (II  Cor. 
I2:i7f.).     He  includes  "apparel"  because  oriental  wealth 


3S6      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

consisted  largely  In  fine  apparel  (not  old  worn  out  clothes). 
See  Gen.  24:53;  II  Kings  5:5;  Psa.  45:i3f.;  Matt.  6:19.  Paul 
did  not  preach  just  for  money. 

34.  Ye  yourselves  (autoi).  Intensive  pronoun.  Certainly 
they  knew  that  the  church  in  Ephesus  had  not  supported 
Paul  while  there.  These  hands  {hai  cheires  hautai).  Paul  was 
not  above  manual  labour.  He  pointed  to  his  hands  with  pride 
as  proof  that  he  toiled  at  his  trade  of  tent-making  as  at 
Thessalonica  and  Corinth  for  his  own  needs  {chreiais)  and 
for  those  with  him  (probably  Aquila  and  Priscilla)  with 
whom  he  lived  and  probably  Timothy  because  of  his  often 
infirmities  (I  Tim.  5:23).  Ministered  {huperetesan).  First 
aorist  active  of  hupereted,  to  act  as  under  rower,  old  verb, 
but  in  the  N.T.  only  in  Acts  13:36;  20:34;  24:23.  While  in 
Ephesus  Paul  wrote  to  Corinth:  *'We  toil,  working  with  our 
own  hands"  (I  Cor.  4:12).  "As  he  held  them  up,  they  saw 
a  tongue  of  truth  in  every  seam  that  marked  them"  (Fur- 
neaux). 

35.  /  gave  you  an  example  (hupedeixa).  First  aorist  active 
indicative  of  hupodeiknumi,  old  verb  to  show  under  one's 
eyes,  to  give  object  lesson,  by  deed  as  well  as  by  word  (Luke 
6:47).  Hupodeigma  means  example  (John  13:15;  James 
5:10).  So  Paul  appeals  to  his  example  in  I  Cor.  ii:i;  Phil. 
3:17.  Panta  is  accusative  plural  of  general  reference  (in  all 
things).  So  labouring  ye  ought  to  help  {houtos  kopiontas  dei 
antilambanesthai) .  So,  as  I  did.  Necessity  {dei).  Toiling 
(kopiontas)  not  just  for  ourselves,  but  to  help  (antilambanes- 
thai), to  take  hold  yourselves  (middle  voice)  at  the  other 
end  (anti).  This  verb  common  in  the  old  Greek,  but  in  the 
N.T.  only  in  Luke  1:54;  Acts  20:35;  ^  '^''^-  ^•^-  T"his  noble 
plea  to  help  the  weak  is  the  very  spirit  of  Christ  (I  Thess. 
5:14;  I  Cor.  12:28;  Rom.  5:6;  14:1).  In  I  Thess.  5:14  ante- 
chesthe  ton  asthenounton  we  have  Paul's  very  idea  again. 
Every  Community  Chest  appeal  today  re-echoes  Paul's 
plea.   He  himself  said  (autos  eipen).   Not  in  the  Gospels,  one 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  357 

of  the  sayings  of  Jesus  in  current  use  that  Paul  had  received 
and  treasured.  Various  other  Agrapha  of  Jesus  have  been 
preserved  in  ancient  writers  and  some  in  recently  discovered 
papyri  which  may  be  genuine  or  not.  We  are  grateful  that 
Paul  treasured  this  one.  This  Beatitude  (on  makarion  see 
on  Matt.  5:3-11)  is  illustrated  by  the  whole  life  of  Jesus 
with  the  Cross  as  the  culmination.  Aristotle  (Eth.  IV.  i) 
has  a  saying  somewhat  like  this,  but  assigns  the  feeling  of 
superiority  as  the  reason  (Page),  an  utterly  different  idea 
from  that  here.  This  quotation  raises  the  question  of  how 
much  Paul  personally  knew  of  the  life  and  sayings  of  Jesus. 

36.  He  kneeled  down  {theis  ta  gonata  autou).  Second  aorist 
active  participle  of  tithemij  to  place.  The  very  idiom  used  in 
7:60  of  Stephen.  Not  in  ancient  writers  and  only  six  times  in 
the  N.T.  (Mark  15:19;  Luke  22:41;  Acts  7:60;  9:40;  20:36; 
21:5).  Certainly  kneeling  in  prayer  is  a  fitting  attitude  (cf. 
Jesus,  Luke  22:41),  though  not  the  only  proper  one  (Matt. 
6:5).     Paul  apparently  prayed  aloud  (proseuxato). 

37.  They  all  wept  sore  {hikanos  klautkmos  egeneto  panton). 
Literally,  There  came  considerable  weeping  of  all  (on  the 
part  of  all,  genitive  case).  Kissed  him  (katephiloun  auton). 
Imperfect  active  of  kataphileo,  old  verb,  intensive  with  kata 
and  repetition  shown  also  by  the  tense :  They  kept  on  kissing 
or  kissed  repeatedly,  probably  one  after  the  other  falling 
on  his  neck.    Cf.  also  Matt.  26:49. 

38.  Sorrowing  {odunomenoi) .  Present  middle  participle  of 
odunao,  old  verb  to  cause  intense  pain,  to  torment  (Luke 
16:24),  middle  to  distress  oneself  (Luke  2:48;  Acts  20:38). 
Nowhere  else  in  N.T.  Which  he  had  spoken  {hoi  eirekei). 
Relative  attracted  to  the  case  of  the  antecedent  logoi  (word). 
Past  perfect  indicative  of  eipon.  They  brought  him  on  his  way 
{proepempon  auton).  Imperfect  active  oi  propempo,  old  verb 
to  send  forward,  to  accompany  as  in  Acts  15:3;  20:38;  21:5;  I 
Cor.  16:6,  II;  II  Cor.  i:i6;  Tit.  3:13;  III  John  6.  Graphic 
picture  of  Paul's  departure  from  this  group  of  ministers. 


CHAPTER  XXI 

1.  Were  parted  from  them  {apospasthentas  ap*  auton). 
First  aorist  passive  participle  of  apospad  same  verb  as  in 
20:30  and  Luke  22-j^i.  Had  set  sail  (anachthenai) .  First 
aorist  passive  of  anago,  the  usual  verb  to  put  out  (up)  to 
sea  as  in  verse  2  (anechthemen) .  We  came  with  a  straight 
course  {euthudromesantes  elthomen).  The  same  verb  (aorist 
active  participle  of  euthudromeo)  used  by  Luke  in  16:11  of 
the  voyage  from  Troas  to  Samothrace  and  Neapolis,  which 
see.  Unto  Cos  (eis  ten  Ko).  Standing  today,  about  forty 
nautical  miles  south  from  Miletus,  island  famous  as  the 
birthplace  of  Hippocrates  and  Apelles  with  a  great  medical 
school.  Great  trading  place  with  many  Jews.  The  next  day 
(tei  hexes).  Locative  case  with  hemerdi  (day)  understood. 
The  adverb  hexes  is  from  echo  (future  hexo)  and  means 
successively  or  in  order.  This  is  another  one  of  Luke's  ways 
of  saying  "on  the  next  day"  (cf.  three  others  in  20:15). 
Unto  Rhodes  {eis  ten  Rhodon).  Called  the  island  of  roses. 
The  sun  shone  most  days  and  made  roses  luxuriant.  The 
great  colossus  which  represented  the  sun,  one  of  the  seven 
wonders  of  the  world,  was  prostrate  at  this  time.  The  island 
was  at  the  entrance  to  the  Aegean  Sea  and  had  a  great 
university,  especially  for  rhetoric  and  oratory.  There  was 
great  commerce  also.  Unto  Patara  {eis  Patara).  A  seaport 
on  the  Lycian  coast  on  the  left  bank  of  the  Xanthus.  It 
once  had  an  oracle  of  Apollo  which  rivalled  that  at  Delphi. 
This  was  the  course  taken  by  hundreds  of  ships  every  season. 

2.  Having  found  a  ship  {heurontes  ploion).  Paul  had  used 
a  small  coasting  vessel  (probably  hired)  that  anchored  each 
night  at  Cos,  Rhodes,  Patara.  He  was  still  some  four  hundred 
miles  from  Jerusalem.    But  at  Patara  Paul  caught  a  large 

3S8 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  359 

vessel  (a  merchantman)  that  could  sail  across  the  open  sea. 
Crossing  over  unto  Phoenicia  (diaper on  eis  Phoiniken). 
Neuter  singular  accusative  (agreeing  with  ploion)  present 
active  participle  of  diaperab,  old  verb  to  go  between  {did) 
and  so  across  to  Tyre.  We  went  aboard  (epibantes).  Second 
aorist  active  participle  of  epibaino, 

3.  When  we  had  come  in  sight  of  Cyprus  (anaphanantes  ten 
Kupron).  First  aorist  active  participle  of  anaphaino  (Doric 
form  -phandntes  rather  than  the  Attic  -phenantes),  old  verb 
to  make  appear,  bring  to  light,  to  manifest.  Having  made 
Cyprus  visible  or  rise  up  out  of  the  sea.  Nautical  terms.  In 
the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  19:1 1  which  see.  On  the  left  hand 
(euonumon).  Compound  feminine  adjective  like  masculine. 
They  sailed  south  of  Cyprus.  We  sailed  (epleomen).  Im- 
perfect active  of  common  verb  pleoy  kept  on  sailing  till  we 
came  to  Syria.  Landedat  Tyre  {katelthomen  eis  Turon).  Came 
down  to  Tyre.  Then  a  free  city  of  Syria  in  honour  of  its 
former  greatness  (cf.  the  long  siege  by  Alexander  the  Great). 
There  (ekeise).  Thither,  literally.  Only  one  other  instance 
in  N.T.,  22:5  which  may  be  pertinent  =  ekei  (there).  Was  to 
unlade  (en  apqphoriizomenon).  Periphrastic  imperfect  middle 
of  apophortizOj  late  verb  from  apo  and  phortos,  load,  but  here 
only  in  the  N.T.  Literally,  "For  thither  the  boat  was  un- 
loading her  cargo,"  a  sort  of  "customary"  or  "progressive" 
imperfect  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  884).  Burden  (gomon). 
Cargo,  old  word,  from  gemo,  to  be  full.  Only  here  and  Rev. 
18:1  if.  in  N.T.  Probably  a  grain  or  fruit  ship.  It  took  seven 
days  here  to  unload  and  reload. 

4.  Having  found  (aneurontes).  Second  aorist  active  parti- 
ciple of  aneuriskdj  to  seek  for,  to  find  by  searching  (ana). 
There  was  a  church  here,  but  it  was  a  large  city  and  the  num- 
ber of  members  may  not  have  been  large.  Probably  some  of 
those  that  fled  from  Jerusalem  who  came  to  Phoenicia  (Acts 
11:19)  started  the  work  here.  Paul  went  also  through 
Phoenicia  on  the  way  to  the  Jerusalem  Conference  (15 :3).  As 


360      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

at  Troas  and  Miletus,  so  here  Paul's  indefatigible  energy 
shows  itself  with  characteristic  zeal.  Through  the  Spirit 
{dia  tou  pneumatos).  The  Holy  Spirit  undoubtedly  who 
had  already  told  Paul  that  bonds  and  afflictions  awaited 
him  in  Jerusalem  (20:23).  ^^^^  ^^  should  not  set  foot  in 
Jerusalem  {me  epibainein  eis  lerosoluma).  Indirect  command 
with  me  and  the  present  active  infinitive,  not  to  keep  on 
going  to  Jerusalem  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1046).  In  spite 
of  this  warning  Paul  felt  it  his  duty  as  before  (20:22)  to  go  on. 
Evidently  Paul  interpreted  the  action  of  the  Holy  Spirit  as 
information  and  warning  although  the  disciples  at  Tyre 
gave  it  the  form  of  a  prohibition.  Duty  called  louder  than 
warning  to  Paul  even  if  both  were  the  calls  of  God. 

5.  That  we  had  accomplished  the  days  {exartisai  hemds  tas 
hemeras).  First  aorist  active  infinitive  of  exartizo,  to  furnish 
perfectly,  rare  in  ancient  writers,  but  fairly  frequent  in  the 
papyri.  Only  twice  in  the  N.T.,  here  and  II  Tim.  3:17. 
Finish  the  exact  number  of  days  (seven)  of  verse  4.  The 
accusative  of  general  reference  hemds  is  the  usual  construc- 
tion and  the  infinitive  clause  is  the  subject  of  egeneto.  We 
departed  and  went  on  our  journey  {exelthontes  eporeuometha). 
Sharp  distinction  between  the  first  aorist  active  participle 
exelthontes  (from  exerchomai,  to  go  out)  and  the  imperfect 
middle  eporeuometha  from  poreuo  (we  were  going  on),  ^nd 
they  all,  with  wives  and  children,  brought  us  on  our  way  {pro- 
pemponton  hemds  panton  sun  gunaixi  kai  teknois).  No  "and" 
in  the  Greek,  simply  genitive  absolute,  "They  all  with  wives 
and  children  accompanying  us,"  just  as  at  Miletus  (20:28), 
same  verb  propempo  which  see.  The  first  mention  of  children 
in  connection  with  the  apostolic  churches  (Vincent).  Vivid 
picture  here  as  at  Miletus,  evident  touch  of  an  eyewitness. 
Till  we  were  out  of  the  city  {heos  exo  tes  poleos).  Note  both 
adverbial  prepositions  {heos  exo)  clear  outside  of  the  city. 

6.  Beach  {aigialon).  As  in  Matt.  13:2  which  see.  This 
scene  is  in  pubHc  as  at  Miletus,  but  they  did  not  care. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  361 

Bade  each  other  farewell  {apespasametha  allelous).  First 
aorist  middle  of  apaspazomai.  Rare  compound,  here  alone 
in  the  N.T.  Tender  scene,  but  "no  bonds  of  long  comrade- 
ship, none  of  the  clinging  love"  (Furneaux)  seen  at  Miletus 
(Acts  20:37f.).  Home  again  {eis  ta  idia).  To  their  own  places 
as  of  the  Beloved  Disciple  in  John  19:27  and  of  Jesus  in  John 
1:1 1.    This  idiom  in  the  papyri  also. 

7.  Had  finished  (dianusantes).  First  aorist  active  parti- 
ciple of  dianuOy  old  verb  to  accomplish  (anuo)  thoroughly 
(did),  only  here  in  the  N.T.  From  Tyre  {apo  Turou).  Page 
takes  (Hackett  also)  with  katentesamen  (we  arrived)  rather 
than  with  "fow  ploun^'  (the  voyage)  and  with  good  reason: 
"And  we,  having  (thereby)  finished  the  voyage,  arrived 
from  Tyre  at  Ptolemais."  Ptolemais  is  the  modern  Acre, 
called  Accho  in  Judges  1:31.  The  harbour  is  the  best  on  the 
coast  of  Palestine  and  is  surrounded  by  mountains.  It  is 
about  thirty  miles  south  of  Tyre.  It  was  never  taken  by 
Israel  and  was  considered  a  Philistine  town  and  the  Greeks 
counted  it  a  Phoenician  city.  It  was  the  key  to  the  road 
down  the  coast  between  Syria  and  Egypt  and  had  suc- 
cessively the  rule  of  the  Ptolemies,  Syrians,  Romans.  Saluted 
{aspasamenoi).  Here  greeting  as  in  21 :  19  rather  than  farewell 
as  in  20:1.  The  stay  was  short,  one  day  {hemeran  mian, 
accusative),  but  "the  brethren"  Paul  and  his  party  found 
easily.  Possibly  the  scattered  brethren  (Acts  11:19)  founded 
the  church  here  or  Philip  may  have  done  it. 

8.  On  the  morrow  (tei  epaurion).  Another  and  the  more 
common  way  of  expressing  this  idea  of  "next  day"  besides 
the  three  in  20:15  ^^^  ^^  ^^^  ^^  21:1.  Unto  Caesarea  {eis 
Kaisariun).  Apparently  by  land  as  the  voyage  (ploun) 
ended  at  Ptolemais  (verse  7).  Caesarea  is  the  political 
capital  of  Judea  under  the  Romans  where  the  procurators 
lived  and  a  city  of  importance,  built  by  Herod  the  Great 
and  named  in  honour  of  Augustus.  It  had  a  magnificent 
harbour  built.    Most  of  the  inhabitants  were  Greeks.    This 


362      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

is  the  third  time  that  we  have  seen  Paul  in  Caesarea,  on  his 
journey  from  Jerusalem  to  Tarsus  (Acts  9:30),  on  his  return 
from  Antioch  at  the  close  of  the  second  mission  tour  (18:22) 
and  now.  The  best  MSS.  omit  hoi  peri  Paulou  (we  that 
were  of  Paul's  company)  a  phrase  like  that  in  13:13.  Into 
the  house  of  Philip  the  evangelist  {eis  ton  oikon  Philippou  tou 
euaggelistou) .  Second  in  the  list  of  the  seven  (6:5)  after 
Stephen  and  that  fact  mentioned  here.  By  this  title  he  is 
distinguished  from  "Philip  the  apostle,"  one  of  the  twelve. 
His  evangelistic  work  followed  the  death  of  Stephen  (Acts 
8)  in  Samaria,  Philistia,  with  his  home  in  Caesarea.  The 
word  "evangelizing"  (eueggelizeto)  was  used  of  him  in  8:40. 
The  earliest  of  the  three  N.T.  examples  of  the  word  "evange- 
list" (Acts  21:8;  Eph.  4:11;  II  Tim.  4:5).  Apparently  a 
word  used  to  describe  one  who  told  the  gospel  story  as  Philip 
did  and  may  have  been  used  of  him  first  of  all  as  John  was 
termed  "the  baptizer"  {ho  baptizon,  Mark  1:4),  then  "the 
Baptist"  {ho  baptistes.  Matt.  3:1).  It  is  found  on  an  in- 
scription in  one  of  the  Greek  islands  of  uncertain  date  and 
was  used  in  ecclesiastical  writers  of  later  times  on  the  Four 
Gospels  as  we  do.  As  used  here  the  meaning  is  a  travelling 
missionary  who  "gospelized"  communities.  This  is  probably 
Paul's  idea  in  II  Tim.  4:5.  In  Eph.  4:11  the  word  seems  to 
describe  a  special  class  of  ministers  just  as  we  have  them 
today.  Men  have  different  gifts  and  Philip  had  this  of 
evangelizing  as  Paul  was  doing  who  is  the  chief  evangelist. 
The  ideal  minister  today  combines  the  gifts  of  evangelist, 
herald,  teacher,  shepherd.  "  fVe  abode  with  him''''  {emeinamen

ful time  Paul  had  In  conversation  with  Philip.  He  could 
learn  from  him  much  of  value  about  the  early  days  of  the 
gospel  in  Jerusalem.  And  Luke  could,  and  probably  did, 
take  notes  from  Philip  and  his  daughters  about  the  begin- 
nings of  Christian  history.    It  is  generally  supposed  that  the

THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  363 

"we"  sections  of  Acts  represent  a  travel  document  by  Luke 
(notes  made  by  him  as  he  journeyed  from  Troas  to  Rome). 
Those  who  deny  the  Lukan  authorship  of  the  whole  book 
usually  admit  this.  So  we  may  suppose  that  Luke  is  already 
gathering  data  for  future  use.  If  so,  these  were  precious 
days  for  him. 

9.  Fir  gins  which  did  prophesy  (parthenoi  propheteusai). 
Not  necessarily  an  "order"  of  virgins,  but  Philip  had  the 
honour  of  having  in  his  home  four  virgin  daughters  with  the 
gift  of  prophecy  which  was  not  necessarily  predicting  events, 
though  that  was  done  as  by  Agabus  here.  It  was  more  than 
ordinary  preaching  (cf.  19:6)  and  was  put  by  Paul  above 
the  other  gifts  like  tongues  (I  Cor.  14:1-33).  The  prophecy 
of  Joel  (2:28f.)  about  their  sons  and  daughters  prophesying 
is  quoted  by  Peter  and  applied  to  the  events  on  the  day  of 
Pentecost  (Acts  2:17).  Paul  in  I  Cor.  11:5  gives  directions 
about  praying  and  prophesying  by  the  women  (apparently 
in  public  worship)  with  the  head  uncovered  and  sharply 
requires  the  head  covering,  though  not  forbidding  the  pray- 
ing and  prophesying.  With  this  must  be  compared  his  de- 
mand for  silence  by  the  women  in  I  Cor.  14:34-40  and  I  Tim. 
2:8-15  which  it  is  not  easy  to  reconcile.  One  wonders  if  there 
was  not  something  known  to  Paul  about  special  conditions 
in  Corinth  and  Ephesus  that  he  has  not  told.  There  was  also 
Anna  the  prophetess  in  the  temple  (Luke  2:36)  besides  the 
inspired  hymns  of  Elizabeth  (Luke  i  :42-45)  and  of  Mary 
(Luke  1 :46-55).  At  any  rate  there  was  no  order  of  women 
prophets  or  official  ministers.  There  were  Old  Testament 
prophetesses  like  Miriam,  Deborah,  Huldah.  Today  in  our 
Sunday  schools  the  women  do  most  of  the  actual  teaching. 
The  whole  problem  is  difficult  and  calls  for  restraint  and 
reverence.  One  thing  is  certain  and  that  is  that  Luke  ap- 
preciated the  services  of  women  for  Christ  as  is  shown  often 
in  his  writings  (Luke  8:1-3,  for  instance)  before  this  incident. 

10.  As  we  tarried  {epimenonton  hembn).  Genitive  absolute. 


364      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Note  epi  (additional)  with  mend  as  in  12:16.  Many  days 
{hemeras  pleious).  More  days  (than  we  expected),  accusative 
of  time.  A  certain  prophet  named  Agabus  (prophetes  onomati 
Agabos).  A  prophet  like  the  daughters  of  Philip,  mentioned 
already  in  connection  with  the  famine  predicted  by  him 
(Acts  11:28),  but  apparently  not  a  man  of  prominence  like 
Barnabas,  and  so  no  allusion  to  that  former  prophecy. 

11.  Coming  {elthon,  second  aorist  active  participle  of  erch- 
omai),  taking  {aras,  first  aorist  active  participle  of  airo,  to 
take  up),  binding  {desas,  first  aorist  active  participle  of  deo, 
to  bind).  Vivid  use  of  three  successive  participles  describing 
the  dramatic  action  of  Agabus.  PauVs  girdle  {ten  zonen  tou 
Paulou).  Old  word  from  zonnumi,  to  gird.  See  on  12:8. 
His  own  feet  and  hands  {heautou  tons  podas  kai  tas  cheiras). 
Basis  for  the  interpretation.  Old  Testament  prophets  often 
employed  symbolic  deeds  (I  Kings  22:11;  James  2:2;  Jer. 
13:1-7;  Ezek.  4:1-6).  Jesus  interpreted  the  symbolism  of 
Peter's  girding  himself  (John  21:18).  So  (houtos).  As  Agabus 
had  bound  himself.  Agabus  was  just  from  Jerusalem  and 
probably  knew  the  feeling  there  against  Paul.  At  any  rate 
the  Holy  Spirit  revealed  it  to  him  as  he  claims.  Shall  de- 
liver (paradosousin).  Like  the  words  of  Jesus  about  himself 
(Matt.  20:19).  He  was  "delivered"  into  the  hands  of  the 
Gentiles  and  it  took  five  years  to  get  out  of  those  hands. 

12.  Both  we  and  they  of  that  place  {hemeis  te  kai  hoi  ento- 
pioi).  Usual  use  of  te  kai  (both — and).  Entopioi,  old  word, 
only  here  in  N.T.  Not  to  go  up  {tou  me  anabainein).  Probably 
ablative  of  the  articular  present  active  infinitive  with  re- 
dundant negative  me  after  parekaloumen  (imperfect  active, 
conative).  We  tried  to  persuade  him  from  going  up.  It 
can  be  explained  as  genitive,  but  not  so  likely:  We  tried  to 
persuade  him  in  respect  to  not  going  up.  Vincent  cites  the 
case  of  Regulus  who  insisted  on  returning  from  Rome  to 
Carthage  to  certain  death  and  that  of  Luther  on  the  way 
to  the  Diet  of  Worms.   Spalatin  begged  Luther  not  to  go  on. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  365 

Luther  said:  "Though  devils  be  as  many  in  Worms  as  tiles 
upon  the  roofs,  yet  thither  will  I  go."  This  dramatic  warning 
of  Agabus  came  on  top  of  that  in  Tyre  (21:4)  and  Paul's 
own  confession  in  Miletus  (20:23).  It  is  small  wonder  that 
Luke  and  the  other  messengers  together  with  Philip  and  his 
daughters  (prophetesses  versus  prophet.^)  joined  in  a  chorus 
of  dissuasion  to  Paul. 

13.  What  are  you  doing  weeping^  (Ti  poieite  klaiontes?) 
Strong  protest  as  in  Mark  11:5.  Breaking  my  heart  {sunthrup^ 
tontes  mou  ten  kardian).  The  verb  sunthrupto,  to  crush  to- 
gether, is  late  Koine  for  apothrupto,  to  break  off,  both  vivid 
and  expressive  words.  So  to  enervate  and  unman  one, 
weakening  Paul's  determination  to  go  on  with  his  duty. 
/  am  ready  {Ego  hetoimos  echo).  I  hold  (myself)  in  readiness 
(adverb,  hetoimos).  Same  idiom  in  II  Cor.  12:14.  Not  only 
to  be  bound  {ou  monon  dethenai).  First  aorist  passive  infinitive 
of  deo  and  note  ou  monon  rather  than  me  monon,  the  usual 
negative  of  the  infinitive  because  of  the  sharp  contrast 
(Robertson,  Grammar^  p.  1095).  Paul's  readiness  to  die, 
if  need  be,  at  Jerusalem  is  like  that  of  Jesus  on  the  way  to 
Jerusalem  the  last  time.  Even  before  that  Luke  (9:51)  said 
that  "he  set  his  face  to  go  on  to  Jerusalem."  Later  the 
disciples  will  say  to  Jesus,  "Master,  the  Jews  were  but  now 
seeking  to  stone  thee;  and  goest  thou  thither?"  (John  1 1 :8). 
The  stature  of  Paul  rises  here  to  heroic  proportions  "for  the 
name  of  the  Lord  Jesus"  (huper  tou  onomatos  tou  kuriou 
lesou). 

14.  When  he  would  not  be  persuaded  {me  peithomenou 
autou).  Genitive  absolute  of  the  present  passive  participle 
of  peitho.  Literally,  "he  not  being  persuaded."  That  was 
all.  Paul's  will  {kardia)  was  not  broken,  not  even  bent,  ffe 
ceased  {hesuchasamen).  Ingressive  aorist  active  indicative 
of  hesuchazo,  old  verb  to  be  quiet,  silent.  The  will  of  the  Lord 
be  done  {tou  kuriou  to  thelema  ginestho).  Present  middle  im- 
perative of  ginomai.    There  Is  a  quaint  naivete  in  this  con-

fession  by  the  friends  of  Paul.  Since  Paul  would  not  let 
them  have  their  way,  they  were  willing  for  the  Lord  to  have 
his  way,  acquiescence  after  failure  to  have  theirs. 

15.  We  took  up  our  baggage  {episkeuasamenoi).  First 
aorist  middle  participle  of  episkeuazo,  old  verb  to  furnish 
{skeuos,  epi)  with  things  necessary,  to  pack  up,  saddle  horses 
here  Ramsay  holds.  Here  only  in  the  N.T.  Went  up  [ane- 
hainomen).  Inchoative  imperfect  active  of  anabaino,  we 
started  to  go  up. 

16.  Certain  of  the  disciples  {ton  matheton).  The  genitive 
here  occurs  with  tines  understood  as  often  in  the  Greek 
idiom,  the  partitive  genitive  used  as  nominative  (Robertson, 
Grammar^  p.  502).  Bringing  {agonies).  Nominative  plural 
participle  agreeing  with  tines  understood,  not  with  case  of 
matheton.  One  Mnason  of  Cyprus,  an  early  disciple,  with 
whom  we  should  lodge  {par  hoi  xenisthomen  Mnasoni  tint 
Kupridi  archaibi  mathetei).  A  thoroughly  idiomatic  Greek 
idiom,  incorporation  and  attraction  of  the  antecedent  into 
the  relative  clause  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  718).  Mnasoni 
is  really  the  object  of  agontes  or  the  accusative  with  para  or 
pros  understood  and  should  be  accusative,  but  it  is  placed 
in  the  clause  after  the  relative  and  in  the  same  locative  case 
with  the  relative  hoi  (due  to  par\  beside,  with).  Then  the 
rest  agrees  in  case  with  Mnasoni.  He  was  originally  from 
Cyprus,  but  now  in  Caesarea.  The  Codex  Bezae  adds  eis 
tina  komen  (to  a  certain  village)  and  makes  it  mean  that 
they  were  to  lodge  with  Mnason  at  his  home  there  about 
halfway  to  Jerusalem.  This  may  be  true.  The  use  of  the  sub- 
junctive xenisthomen  (first  aorist  passive  of  xenizo,  to  enter- 
tain strangers  as  in  Acts  10:6,  23,  32  already)  may  be  volitive 
of  purpose  with  the  relative  (Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  955, 
989).  The  use  of  archaioi  for  "early"  may  refer  to  the  fact 
that  he  was  one  of  the  original  disciples  at  Pentecost  as 
Peter  in  157  uses  hemeron  archaion  (early  days)  to  refer  to 
his  experience  at  Ccasarea  in  Acts  10.    "As  the  number  of

the  first  disciples  lessened,  the  next  generation  accorded  a 
sort  of  honour  to  the  survivors"  (Furneaux), 

17.  When  we  were  come  {genomenon  hemon).  Genitive 
absolute  again,  "we  having  come."  Received  {apedexanto). 
Apodechomai,  to  receive  from.  This  old  compound  only  in 
Luke  in  the  N.T.  Gladly  (asmenos).  Old  adverb  hesmenos 
from  hedomaij  to  be  pleased.  Here  only  in  the  N.T.  Perhaps 
this  first  glad  welcome  was  from  Paul's  personal  friends  in 
Jerusalem. 

18.  The  day  following  {tei  epiousei).  As  in  20:15  which  sep. 
Went  in  (eiseiei).  Imperfect  active  of  eiseimi^  old  classic  verb 
used  only  four  times  in  the  N.T.  (Acts  3:3;  21:18,  26;  Heb. 
9:6),  a  mark  of  the  literary  style  rather  than  the  colloquial 
Koine  use  of  eiserchomai.  Together  with  us  to  James  {sun 
hemin  pros  lakobon).  So  then  Luke  is  present.  The  next 
use  of  "we"  is  in  27:1  when  they  leave  Caesarea  for  Rome, 
but  it  is  not  likely  that  Luke  was  away  from  Paul  in  Jeru- 
salem and  Caesarea.  The  reports  of  what  was  done  and 
said  in  both  places  is  so  full  and  minute  that  it  seems  reason- 
able that  Luke  got  first  hand  information  here  whatever 
his  motive  was  for  so  full  an  account  of  these  legal  proceed- 
ings to  be  discussed  later.  There  are  many  details  that 
read  like  an  eye  witness's  story  (21:30,  35,  40;  22:2,  3; 
23:12,  etc.).  It  was  probably  the  house  of  James  {pros  and 
para  so  used  often).  And  all  the  elders  were  present  {pantes  te 
paregenonto  hoi  presbuteroi).  Clearly  James  is  the  leading 
elder  and  the  others  are  his  guests  in  a  formal  reception  to 
Paul.  It  is  noticeable  that  the  apostles  are  not  mentioned, 
though  both  elders  and  apostles  are  named  at  the  Confer- 
ence in  chapter  15.  at  would  seem  that  the  apostles  are  away 
on  preaching  tours./  The  whole  church  was  not  called  to- 
gether probably  Because  of  the  known  prejudice  against 
Paul  created  by  the  Judaizers. 

19.  He  rehearsed  {exegetiof.  Imperfect  middle  of  exegeomai, 
old  verb  to  lead  out,  to  draw  out  in  narrative,  to  recount.  So

Paul  is  pictured  as  taking  his  time  for  he  had  a  great  story 
to  tell  of  what  had  happened  since  they  saw  him  last.  One  by 
one  {kath'  hena  hekaston).  According  to_each_one  (item)  and 
the  adverbial  phrase  used  as  an  accusative  after  the  verb

kath'  hena  hekastos  in  Eph.  5:33.  Which  (hon).  Genitive

theos).  Summary  constative  aorist  active  indicative  that 
gathers  up  all  that  God  did  and  he  takes  pains  to  give  God 
the  glory.  It  is  possible  that  at  this  formal  meeting  Paul 
observed  an  absence  of  warmth  and  enthusiasm  in  contrast 
with  the  welcome  accorded  by  his  friends  the  day  before 
(verse  17).  Furneaux  thinks  that  Paul  was  coldly  received 
on  this  day  in  spite  of  the  generous  offering  brought  from  the 
Gentile  Christians.  "It  looks  as  though  his  misgiving  as  to 
its  reception  (Rom.  15:31)  was  confirmed.  Nor  do  we  hear 
that  the  Christians  of  Jerusalem  later  put  in  so  much  as  a

_authorities,.  or  expressed  any  sympathy  with  him  during 
his  long  imprisonment  at  Caesarea"  (Furneaux).  The  most 
that  can  be  said  is  that  the  Judaizers  referred  to  by  James 
do  not  appear  actively  against  him.  The  collection  and  the 
plan  proposed  by  James  accomplished  that  much  at  any 
rate.    It  stopped  the  mouths  of  those  lions. 

20.  Glorified  (edoxazon).  Inchoative  imperfect,  began  to 
glorify  God,  though  without  special  praise  of  Paul.  How 
many  thousands  {posai  muriades).  Old  word  for  ten  thousand 
(Acts  19:19)  and  then  an  indefinite  number  like  our  "my- 
riads" (this  very  word)  as  Luke  12:1;  Acts  21:20;  Jude  14; 
Rev.  5:11;  9:16.  But  it  is  a  surprising  statement  even  with 
allowable  hyperbole,  but  one  may  recall  Acts  4:4  (number 
of  the  men — not  women — about  five  thousand);  5:14  (multi- 
tudes both  of  men  and  women) ;  6  \J.  There  were  undoubtedly 
a  great  many  thousands  of  believers  in  Jerusalem  and  all 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  369 

Jewish  Christians,  some,  alas,  Judaizers  (Acts  11:2;  15:1,  5). 
This  list  may  include  the  Christians  from  neighbouring  towns 
in  Palestine  and  even  some  from  foreign  countries  here  at  the 
Feast  of  Pentecost,  for  it  is  probable  that  Paul  arrived  in 
time  for  it  as  he  had  hoped.  But  we  do  not  have  to  count  the 
hostile  Jews  from  Asia  (verse  27)  who  were  clearly  not 
Christians  at  all.  All  zealous  for  the  law  {pantes  zelotai  tou 
nomou).  Zealots  (substantive)  rather  than  zealous  (adjec- 
tive) with  objective  genitive  {tou  nomou).  The  word  zealot  is 
from  zeloo,  to  burn  with  zeal,  to  boil.  The  Greek  used  zelotes 
for  an  imitator  or  admirer.  There  was  a  party  of  Zealots  (de- 
veloped from  the  Pharisees),  a  group  of  what  would  be  called 
"hot-heads,"  who  brought  on  the  war  with  Rome.  One 
of  this  party,  Simon  Zelotes  (Acts  1:13),  was  in  the  number 
of  the  twelve  apostles.  It  is  important  to  understand  the 
issues  in  Jerusalem.  It  was  settled  at  the  Jerusalem  Con- 
ference (Acts  15  and  Galatians  2)  that  the  Mosaic  ceremonial 
law  was  not  to  be  imposed  upon  Gentile  Christians.  Paul 
won  freedom  for  them,  but  it  vyas  not  said-that  it  was  wrong 
for  JewisjL-Christians  to  go  on  observing  it  if  they  wished. 
We  have  seen  Paul  observing  the  pa';snvpr  in  Philippi  (Acts 
20:6)  and  planning  to  reach  Jerusalem  for  Pentecost  (20:16). 
The  Judaizers  rankled  under  Paul's  victory  and  power  in 
spreading  the  gospel  among  the  Gentiles  and  gave  him  great 
trouble  in  Galatia  and  Corinth.  They  were  busy  against 
him  in  Jerusalem  also  and  it  was  to  undo  the  harm  done  by 
them  in  Jerusalem  that  Paul  gathered  the  great  collection 
from  the  Gentile  Christians  and  brought  it  with  him  and  the 
delegates  from  the  churches.  Clearly  then  Paul  had  real 
ground  for  his  apprehension  of  trouble  in  Jerusalem  while 
still  in  Corinth  (Rom.  15:25)  when  he  asked  for  the  prayers 
of  the  Roman  Christians  (verses  30-32).  The  repeated  warn- 
ings along  the  way  were  amply  justified. 

21.   They  have  been  informed  concerning  thee  {katechethesan 
peri  sou).   First  aorist  passive  indicative  of  katecheo.   A  word 


370      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

in  the  ancient  Greek,  but  a  few  examples  survive  in  the 
papyri.  It  means  to  sound  (echo,  from  echo,  our  word)  down 
(kata),  to  resound^  re-echo,  to  teach  orally.  Oriental  students 
today  (Arabs  learning  the  Koran)  often  study  aloud.  In 
\  the  N.T.  only  in  Luke  1:4  which  see;  Acts  18:25;  21:21;  I 
Cor.  14:19;  Gal.  6:6;  Rom.  2:18.  This  oral  teaching  about 
Paul  was  done  diligently  by  the  Judaizers  who  had  raised 
trouble  against  Peter  (Acts  11:2)  and  Paul  (15:1,  5).  They 
had  failed  in  their  attacks  on  Paul's  world  campaigns. 
Now  they  try  to  undermine  him  at  home.  In  Paul's  long 
absence  from  Jerusalem,  since  18:22,  they  have  had  a  free 
hand,  save  what  opposition  James  would  give,  and  have  had 
great  success  in  prejudicing  the  Jerusalem  Christians  against 
Paul.  So  James,  in  the  presence  of  the  other  elders  and 
probably  at  their  suggestion,  feels  called  upon  to  tell  Paul 
the  actual  situation.  That  thou  teachest  all  the  Jews  which 
are  among  the  Gentiles  to  forsake  Moses  {hoti  apostasian 
didaskeis  apo  Mouse os  tous  kata  ta  ethne  pantas  loudaious). 
Two  accusatives  with  didaskeis  (verb  of  teaching)  according 
to  rule.  Literally,  "That  thou  art  teaching  all  the  Jews 
among  {kata)  the  Gentiles  (the  Jews  of  the  dispersion  as  in 
2:9)  apostasy  from  Moses."  That  is  the  point,  the  dreadful 
word  apostasian  (ouna^ostasy) ,  a  late  form  (I  Mace.  2:15) 
for  the  earlier  apostasis  (cf.  II  Thess.  2:3  for  apostasia). 
"In  the  eyes  of  the  church  at  Jerusalem  this  was  a  far  more 
serious  matter  than  the  previous  question  at  the  Conference 
about  the  status  of  Gentile  converts"  (Furneaux).  Paul  had 
brought  that  issue  to  the  Jerusalem  Conference  because  of 
the  contention  of  the  Judaizers.  But  here  it  is  not  the 
Judaizers,  but  the  elders  of  the  church  with  James  as  their 
spokesman  on  behalf  of  the  church  as  a  whole.  They  do  not 
believe  this  false  charge,  but  they  wish  Paul  to  set  it  straight. 
Paul  had  made  his  position  clear  in  his  Epistles  (I  Corin- 
thians, Galatians,  Romans)  for  all  who  cared  to  know.

(Paul),  the  subject  of  didaskeis.  This  is  not  indirect  asser- 
tion, but  indirect  command,  hence  the  negative  me  in- 
stead of  Qu  with  the  infinitive  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1046). 
The  point  is  not^  that  Paul  stated  what  the  Jewish  Chris- 
tian's in  the  dispersion  do,  but  that  he  says  that  they 
{autous  accusative  of  general  reference)  are  not  to  go  on 
circumcising  {periternnein,  present  active  infinitive)  their 
children.  Paul  taught  x\]e  vpry  nppnRitp  (I  Cor.  7:18)  and  had 
Timothy  circumcised  (Acts  16:3)  because  he  was  half  Jew 
and  half  Greek.  His  own  practice  is  stated  in  I  Cor,  9:19 
("to  the  Jews  as  a  Jew").  Neither  to  walk  after  the  customs 
{mede  tois  ethesin  peripatein) .  Locative  case  with  infinitive 
peripatein.  The  charge  was  here  enlarged  to  cover  it  all  and 
to  make  Paul  out  an  enemy  of  Jewish  life  and  teach- 
ings. That  same  charge  had  been  made  against  Stephen 
when  young  Saul  (Pauljwas  the  leader  (6:14):  "Will  change 
the  customs  (ethe  the  very  word  used  here)  which  Moses 
delivered  unto  us."  It  actually  seemed  that  some  of  the 
Jews  cared  more  for  Moses  thaiL-£Qr_God  (Acts  6:11).  So 
much  for  the  charge  of  the  Judaizers. 

22.  What  is  it  therefore?  {Ti  oun  estin?).  See  this  form  of 
question  by  Paul  (I  Cor.  14:15,  26).  What  is  to  be  done 
about  it.''  Clearly  James  and  the  elders  do  not  believe  these 
misrepresentations  of  Paul's  teaching,  but  many  do.  They 
wiUcertainh  hear  {pantos  akousontai).  Pantos  is  old  adverb, 
by  all  means,  altogether,  wholly,  certainly  as  here  and  28:4; 
Luke  4:23;  I  Cor.  9:10.  This  future  middle  of  akoud  is  the 
usual  form  instead  of  akouso.  There  was  np  way  to  conceal 
Paul's  arrival  noi^was  it  wise  to  do  so.  B  C  and  several 
cursives  omit  dei  plethos  sunelthein  (The  multitude  must 
needs  come  together). 

23.  Do  therefore  this  {touto  oun  poieson).  The  elders  had 
thought  out  a  plan  of  procedure  by  which  Paul  could  set 
the  whole  matter  straight.    We  have  {eisin  hemin).    "There

are  to  us"  (dative  of  possession  as  in  i8:io).  Apparently 
members  of  the  Jerusalem  church.  Which  have  a  vow  on  them 
(euchen  echontes  aph" — or  eph'  heautbn).  Apparently  a  tem- 
porary Nazarite  vow  like  that  in  Numb.  6:1-21  and  its  com- 
pletion was  marked  by  several  offerings  in  the  temple, 
the  shaving  of  the  head  (Numb.  6:13-15).  Either  Paul 
or  Aquila  had  such  a  vow  on  leaving  Cenchreae  (Acts 
18:18).  "It  was  considered  a  work  of  piety  to  relieve  needy 
Jews  from  the  expenses  connected  with  this  vow,  as  Paul 
does  here"  (Page).  The  reading  aph'  heautbn  would  mean 
that  they  had  taken  the  vow  voluntarily  or  of  themselves 
(Luke  12:57;  II  Cor.  3:5),  while  eph  heauton  means  that 
the  vow  lies  on  them  still. 

24.  These  take  {toutous  paralahbn).  Second  aorist  active 
participle  of  paralambanb.  Taking  these  alone.  Purify  thy- 
self with  them  {hagnistheti  sun  autois).  First  aorist  passive 
imperative  of  hagnizb,  old  verb  to  purify,  to  make  pure 
(hagnos).  See  the  active  voice  in  James  4:8;  I  Peter  1:22; 
I  John  3:3.  It  is  possible  to  see  the  full  passive  force  here, 
"Be  purified."  But  a  number  of  aorist  passives  in  the  Koine 
supplant  the  aorist  middle  forms  and  preserve  the  force  of 
the  middle  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  819).  That  is  possible 
here.  Hence,  "Purify  thyself"  is  allowable.  The  word 
occurs  in  Numb.  67ifortakmg  the  Nazarite  vow.  The  point 
tX  is  that  Paul  takes  the  vow  with  them.  Note  hagnismou  in 
verse  26.  Be  at  charges  for  them  (dapaneson  ep*  autois).  First 
aorist  active  imperative  of  old  verb  dapanab,  to  incur  ex- 
pense, expend.  Spend  (money)  upon  (<?/>')  them.  Ramsay 
{St.  Paul  the  Traveller,  etc.,  p.  310)  argues  that  Paul  had  use 
of  considerable  money  at  this  period,  perhaps  from  his 
father's  estate.  The  charges  for  five  men  would  be  con- 
siderable. "A  poor  man  would  not  have  been  treated  with 
the  respect  paid  him  at  Caesarea,  on  the  voyage,  and  at 
Rome"  (Furneaux).  That  they  may  shave  their  heads  (hina 
xuresontai    ten    kephaleu).      Note    ten    kephalen,    the    head 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  373 

(singular).  Future  middle  indicative  of  xurao,  late  form  for 
the  old  xureo,  to  shave,  middle  to  shave  oneself  or  (causative) 
to  get  oneself  shaved.  This  use  of  hina  with  the  future  in- 
dicative is  like  the  classic  hopos  with  the  future  indicative 
and  is  common  in  the  N.T.  as  in  the  Koine  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  p.  984).  ^nd  all  shall  know  {kai  gnosontai).  This 
future  middle  indicative  of  ginosko  (cf.  akousontai  in  verse 
22)  may  be  independent  of  hina  or  dependent  on  it  like 
xuresontai,  though  some  MSS.  (H  L  P)  have  gnosin  (second 
aorist  subjunctive,  clearly  dependent  on  hina).  Of  which 
(hon).  Genitive  plural  of  the  relative  ha  (accusative)  ob- 
ject of  the  perfect  passive  verb  katechentai  (cf.  verse  21 
katechethesan)  attracted  into  the  case  of  the  omitted  ante- 
cedent touton.  The  instruction  still  in  effect.  But  that  thou 
thyself  walkest  orderly  {alia  stoicheis  kai  autos).  Stoicheis  is  an 
old  verb  to  go  in  ajow  (from  stoichos,  row,  rank,  series),  to 
jtralkJii  a  line  or  bv  rule.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Gal. 
5:25;  Rom.  4:12;  Phil.  3:16.  The  rule  is  the  law  and  Paul 
was  not  a  sidestepper.  The  idea  of  the  verb  is  made  plain  by 
the  participle  phulasson  ton  nomon  (keeping  or  observing  the 
law). 

25.  We  wrote  (epesteilamen).  First  aorist  active  of  epis- 
telloj  to  send  to  and  so  to  write  like  our  epistle  (epistole).  Old 
verb,  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  15:20;  Heb.  13:22. 
It  is  the  very  word  used  by  James  in  this  "judgment"  at  the 
Conference  (Acts  15:20,  episteilai).  B  D  here  read  apesteila- 
men  from  apostello,  to  send  away,  to  give  orders.  Wendt  and 
Schuerer  object  to  this  as  a  gloss.  Rather  is  it  an  explanation 
by  James  that  h^  Hopr  not  rpfpr  to  the  Gentile  Christians 
whose  freedom  from  the  Mosaic  ceremonial  law  was  guaran- 
teed at  the  Jerusalem  Conference.  James  himself  presided  at 
that  Conference  and  offered  the  resolution  that  was  unan- 
imously adopted.  James  stands  by  that  agreement  and 
repeats  the  main  items  (four:  anything  sacrificed  to  idols, 
blood,  anything  strangled,  fornication,  for  discussion  see 


374     WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

ch.  15)  from  which  they  are  to  keep  themselves  (direct 
middle  phulassesthai  of  phulasso,  indirect  command  after 
krinantes  with  accusative,  autous,  of  general  reference). 
James  has  thus  again  cleared  the  air  about  the  Gentiles 
who  have  believed  (pepisteukotouy  perfect  active  participle 
genitive  plural  of  pisteud).  He  asks  that  Paul  will  stand 
by  the  right  of  Jewish  Christians  to  keep  on  observing  the 
Mosaic  law.   He  has  put  the  case  squarely  and  fairly. 

26.  7*00^  the  men  {paralabbn  tous  andras).  The  very 
phrase  used  in  verse  24  to  Paul.  The  next  day  {tei  echomenei). 
One  of  the  phrases  in  20:15  for  the  coming  day.  Locative 
case  of  time.  Purifying  himself  with  them  {sun  autois  hagnis- 
theis,  first  aorist  passive  participle  of  hagnizo).  The  precise 
language  again  of  the  recommendation  in  verse  24.  Paul

which  see.  Went  on  into  the  temple,  descriptive  imperfect. 
Paul  joined  the  four  men  in  their  vow  of  separation.  Declar- 
ing (diaggellon).  To  the  priests  what  day  he  would  report 
the  fulfilment  of  the  vow.  The  priests  would  desire  notice 
of  the  sacrifice.  This  verb  only  used  by  Luke  in  N.T.  except 
Rom.  11:17  (quotation  from  the  LXX).  It  is  not  necessary 
to  assume  that  the  vows  of  each  of  the  five  expired  on  the 
same  day  (Rackham).  Until  the  offering  was  offered  for  every 
one  of  them  {heds  hou  prosenechthe  huper  henos  hekastou  auton 
he  prosphora).  This  use  of  heos  hou  (like  heos,  alone)  with 
the  first  aorist  passive  indicative  prosenechthe  of  prosphero,  to 
offer,  contemplates  the  final  result  (Robertson,  Grammar^ 
pp.  974f.)  and  is  probably  the  statement  of  Luke  added  to 
Paul's  announcement.  He  probably  went  into  the  temple  one 
/  day  for  each  of  the  brethren  and  one  for  himself.  The  ques- 
tion arises  whether  Paul  acted  wisely  or  unwisely  in  agreeing 
to  the  suggestion  of  James.  What  he  did  was  in  perfect  har- 
>J  mony  with  his  principle  of  jxcommodation  in  I  Cor.  9:20

THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  375 

this  occasion  Paul  was  undulvinfluenced  by  rnnsirlfratiorLa^ 
expediency  and  was  willing  for  the  Jewish  Christians  to 
believe  him  more  of  a  Jew  than  was  true  in  order  to  placate 
the  situation  in  Jerusalem.  Furneaux  calls  it  a  compromise 
and  a  failure.  I  do  not  so  see  it.  To  say  that  is  to  obscure  the 
whxde-jCQgiplex  situation.  What  Paul  did  was  not  for  the 
purpose  of  conciliating  his  opponents,  the  Judaizers,  who  had 
diligently  spread  falsehoods  about  him  in  Jerusalem  as  in 
Corinth.  It  was  solely  to  break  the  power  of  these  "false 
apostles"  over  the  thousands  in  Jerusalem  who  have  been 
deluded  by  Paul's  accusers.  So  far  as  the  evidence  goes  that 
thing  was  accomplished.  In  the  trouble  that  comes  in 
Jerusalem  and  Caesarea  the  Judaizers  cut  no  figure  at  all. 
The  Jewish  Christians  do  not  appear  in  Paul's  behalf,  but 
there  was  no  opportunity  for  them  to  do  so.  The  explosion 
that  came  on  the  last  day  of  Paul's  appearance  in  the  temple 
was  wholly  disconnected  from  his  offerings  for  the  four 
brethren  and  himself.  It  must  be  remembered  that  Paul  had 
many  kinds  of  enemies.  The  attack  on  him  by  these  Jews 
from  Asia  had  no  connexion  whatever  with  the  slanders 
of  the  Judaizers  about  Paul's  alleged  teachings  that  Jewish 
Christians  in  the  dispersion  should  depart  from  the  Mosaic 
law.  That  slander  was  put  to  rest  forever  by  his  following 
the  advice  of  James  and  justifies  the  wisdom  of  that  advice 
and  Paul's  conduct  about  it. 

27.  The  seven  days  (hai  hepta  h enter ai).  For  which  Paul 
had  taken  the  vow,  though  there  may  be  an  allusion  to  the 
Pentecostal  week  for  which  Paul  had  desired  to  be  present 
(20:16).  There  is  no  necessary  connexion  with  the  vow  in 
18:15.  I^  24-17  Paul  makes  a  general  reference  to  his  purpose 
in  coming  to  Jerusalem  to  bring  alms  and  offerings  (pros- 
pkoras,  sacrifices).  Paul  spent  seven  days  in  Troas  (20:6), 
Tyre  (21:4),  and  had  planned  for  seven  here  if  not  more. 
It  was  on  the  last  of  the  seven  days  when  Paul  was  complet- 
ing his  offerings  about  the  vows  on  all  five  that  the  incident

occurred  that  was  to  make  him  a  prisoner  for  five  years. 
When  they  saw  him  in  the  temple  {theasamenoi  auton  en  tbi 
hieroi).  First  aorist  middle  participle  of  theaomai  (from 
thea,  a  view,  cf.  theatre)  to  behold.  In  the  very  act  of  honour- 
ing the  temple  these  Jews  from  Asia  raise  a  hue  and  cry  that 
he  is  dishonouring  it.  Paul  was  not  known  by  face  now  to 
many  of  the  Jerusalem  Jews,  though  once  the  leader  of  the 
persecution  after  the  death  of  Stephen  and  the  outstanding 
young  Jew  of  the  day.  But  the  Jews  in  Ephesus  knew  him 
only  too  well,  some  of  whom  are  here  at  the  pentecostal  feast. 
They  had  plotted  against  him  in  Ephesus  to  no  purpose  (Acts 
19:23-41;  20:19),  t>ut  now  a  new  opportunity  had  come.  It 
is  possible  that  the  cry  was  led  by  Alexander  put  forward 
by  the  Jews  in  Ephesus  (19:33)  who  may  be  the  same  as 
Alexander  the  coppersmith  who  did  Paul  so  much  harm  (II 
Tim.  4:14).  Paul  was  not  in  the  inner  sanctuary  {ho  naos), 
but  only  in  the  outer  courts  {to  hieron).  Stirred  up  all  the  mul- 
titude {sunecheon  panta  ton  ochlon).  Imperfect  (kept  on) 
active  of  suncheb  or  sunchunb  {-unnb),  to  pour  together,  to 
confuse  as  in  Acts  2:6;  9:22;  19:31,  32;  21:31  and  here  to  stir 
up  by  the  same  sort  of  confusion  created  by  Demetrius  in 
Ephesus  where  the  same  word  is  used  twice  (19:31,  32). 
The  Jews  from  Ephesus  had  learned  it  from  Demetrius 
the  silversmith.  Laid  hands  on  him  {epebalan  ep^  auton  tas 
cheiras).  Second  aorist  (ingressive,  with  endings  of  the  first 
aorist,  -an)  active  indicative  of  epiballb,  old  verb  to  lay  upon, 
to  attack  (note  repetition  of  epi).  They  attacked  and  seized 
Paul  before  the  charge  was  made. 

28.  Help  {boetheite).  Present  active  imperative  of  boetheb, 
to  run  {theb)  at  a  cry  {boe),  as  if  an  outrage  had  been  com- 
mitted like  murder  or  assault.  All  men  everywhere  {pantas 
pantachei).  Alliterative.  Pantachei  is  a  variation  in  MSS., 
often  pantachou,  and  here  only  in  the  N.T.  The  charges 
against  Paul  remind  one  of  those  against  Stephen  (Acts 
6:13)  in  which  Paul  had  participated  according  to  his  con- 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  377 

fession  (22:20).  Like  the  charges  against  Stephen  and  Jesus 
before  him  truth  and  falsehood  are  mixed.  Paul  had  said 
that  being  a  Jew  would  not  save  a  man.  He  had  taught  the 
law  of  Moses  was  not  binding  on  Gentiles.  He  did  hold, 
like  Jesus  and  Stephen,  that  the  temple  was  not  the  only 
place  to  worship  God.  But  Paul  gloried  himself  in  being  a 
Jew,  considered  the  Mosaic  law  righteous  for  Jews,  and  was 
honouring  the  temple  at  this  very  moment.  And  moreover  also 
he  brought  Greeks  also  into  the  temple  {eti  te  kai  Hellenas  eisega- 
gen  eis  to  hieron).  Note  the  three  particles  {eti  te  kai),  and  {te) 
still  more  {eti)  also  or  even  {kai).  Worse  than  his  teaching 
{didaskon)  is  his  dreadful  deed:  he  actually  brought  {eisega- 
gen,  second  aorist  active  indicative  of  eisago).  This  he  had 
a  right  to  do  if  they  only  went  into  the  court  of  the  Gentiles. 
But  these  Jews  mean  to  imply  that  Paul  had  brought  Greeks 
beyond  this  court  into  the  court  of  Israel.  An  inscription 
was  found  by  Clermont-Ganneau  in  Greek  built  into  the 
walls  of  a  mosque  on  the  Via  Dolorosa  that  was  on  the  wall 
dividing  the  court  of  Israel  from  the  court  of  the  Gentiles. 
Death  was  the  penalty  to  any  Gentile  who  crossed  over 
into  the  Court  of  Israel  {The  Athenaeum,  July,  1871).  Hath 
defiled  this  holy  place  {kekoinoken  ton  hagion  topon  touton). 
Present  perfect  active  of  koinoo,  to  make  common  (see  on 
10:14).  Note  vivid  change  of  tense,  the  defilement  lasts 
(state  of  completion).  All  this  is  the  substance  of  the  call 
of  these  shrewd  conspirators  from  Ephesus,  Jews  (not 
Jewish  Christians,  not  even  Judaizers)  who  hated  him  for 
his  work  there  and  who  probably  "spoke  evil  of  the  Way 
before  the  multitude"  there  so  that  Paul  had  to  separate  the 
disciples  from  the  synagogue  and  go  to  the  School  of  Tyran- 
nus  (i9:9f.).  These  enemies  of  Paul  had  .now  raised  the  cry 
of  "fire"  and  vanish  from  the  scene  completely  (24:19). 
This  charge  was  absolutely  false  as  we  shall  see,  made  out 
of  inferences  of  hate  and  suspicion. 

29.  For  {gar).    Luke  adds  the  reason  for  the  wild  charges

made  against  Paul.  They  had  before  seen  (esan  proeorakotes). 
Periphrastic  past  perfect  of  proorao,  old  verb  to  see  before, 
whether  time  or  place.  Only  twice  in  the  N.T.,  here  and 
Acts  2:25  quoted  from  Psa.  15:8.  Note  the  double  reduplica- 
tion in  -eo-  as  in  Attic  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  364).  With 
him  in  the  city  Trophimus  the  Ephesian  {Trophimon  ton 
Ephesion  en  tei  polei  sun  autoi).  The  Jews  from  Asia  (Ephe- 
sus)  knew  Trophimus  by  sight  as  well  as  Paul.  One  day 
they  saw  both  of  them  together  (sun)  in  the  city.  That  was  a 
fact.  They  had  just  seized  Paul  in  the  temple  {hieron).  That 
was  another  fact.  They  supposed  (enomizon).  Imperfect  ac- 
tive of  nomizo,  common  to  think  or  suppose.  Perfectly  harm- 
less word,  but  they  did,  as  so  many  people  do,  put  their  sup- 
posed inference  on  the  same  basis  with  the  facts.  They  did 
not  see  Trophimus  with  Paul  now  in  the  temple,  nor  had 
they  ever  seen  him  there.  They  simply  argued  that,  if  Paul 
was  willing  to  be  seen  down  street  with  a  Greek  Christian, 
he  would  not  hesitate  to  bring  him  (therefore,  did  bring 
him,  eisegagen  as  in  verse  28)  into  the  temple,  that  is  into 
the  court  of  Israel  and  therefore  both  Paul  and  Trophimus 
were  entitled  to  death,  especially  Paul  who  had  brought  him 
in  (if  he  had)  and,  besides,  they  now  had  Paul.  This  is  the 
way  of  the  mob-mind  in  all  ages.  Many  an  innocent  man 
has  been  rushed  to  his  death  by  the  fury  of  a  lynching  party. 
30.  All  the  city  was  shaken  (ekinethe  he  polis  hole).  First 
aorist  passive  of  kineo,  common  verb  for  violent  motion  and 
emotion.  See  also  24:5  where  the  word  is  used  byTertullus 
of  Paul  as  the  stirrer  up  of  riots!  The  people  ran  together 
{egeneto  sundrome  tou  laou).  Rather,  There  came  a  running 
together  (sun-drome  from  sun-trecho)  of  the  people.  The 
cry  spread  like  wildfire  over  the  city  and  there  was  a  pell- 
mell  scramble  or  rush  to  get  to  the  place  of  the  disturbance. 
They  laid  hold  on  Paul  (epilabomenoi  tou  Paulou).  Second 
aorist  middle  participle  of  epilamhanomai  with  the  genitive 
(cf.  epebalan  in  verse  27).    Dragged  (heilkon).    Imperfect  ac-

tive  of  helko  (and  also  helkuo),  old  verb  to  drag  or  draw. 
Imperfect  tense  vividly  pictures  the  act  as  going  on.  They 
were  saving  the  temple  by  dragging  Paul  outside.  Curiously 
enough  both  epilahomenoi  and  heilkusan  occur  in  16:19 
about  the  arrest  of  Paul  and  Silas  in  Philippi.  Straightway 
the  doors  were  shut  [eutheos  ekleisthesan  hai  thurai).  With 
a  bang  and  at  once.  First  aorist  (effective)  passive  of  kleib. 
The  doors  between  the  inner  court  and  the  court  of  the 
Gentiles.  But  this  was  only  the  beginning,  the  preparation 
for  the  .real  work  of  the  mob.  They  did  not  wish  to  defile  the 
holy  place  with  blood.   The  doors  were  shut  by  the  Levites. 

31.  As  they  were  seeking  to  kill  him  {zetoujiton  auton). 
Genitive  absolute  of  zeteo,  to  seek,  without  auton  (they). 
This  was  their  real  purpose.  Tidings  (phasis).  From  phaino, 
to  show.  Old  word  for  the  work  of  informers  and  then  the 
exposure  of  secret  crime.  In  LXX.  Here  only  in  the  N.T. 
Came  up  (anebe).  Naturally  in  the  wild  uproar.  The  Roman 
guard  during  festivals  was  kept  stationed  in  the  Tower  of 
Antonia  at  the  northwest  corner  of  the  temple  overlooking 
the  temple  and  connected  by  stairs  (verse  35).  To  the  chief 
captain  {toi  chiliarchoi) .  Commander  of  a  thousand  men  or 
cohort  (Mark  15:16).  His  name  was  Claudius  Lysias.  Of  the 
band  (tes  speires).  Each  legion  had  six  tribunes  and  so 
each  tribune  (chiliarch)  had  a  thousand  if  the  cohort  had 
its  full  quota.  See  on  10:1 ;  27:1 .  The  word  is  the  Latin  spira 
(anything  rolled  up).  Note  the  genitive  speires  instead  of 
speiras  (Attic).  fFas  in  confusion  {sunchunnetai) .  Present 
passive  indicative  of  sunchunno  (see  verse  27,  sunecheon). 
This  is  what  the  conspirators  had  desired. 

32.  Forthwith  (exautes).  Common  in  the  Koine  {ex  autes, 
supply  horaSy  hour).  He  took  (paralabon).  See  verses  24  and 
26.  Centurions  (hekatontarchas).  See  on  Luke  7:2  for  discus- 
sion. Plural  shows  that  Lysias  the  chiliarch  took  several 
hundred  soldiers  along  (a  centurion  with  each  hundred). 
Ran  down  (katedramen).     Effective  second  aorist  active  in- 


38o      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

dicative  of  katatrechb.  From  the  tower  of  Antonia,  vivid 
scene.  And  they  {hoi  de).  Demonstrative  use  of  hoi.  The 
Jewish  mob  who  had  begun  the  work  of  killing  Paul  (verse 
31).  Left  off  beating  Paul  {epausanto  tuptontes  ton  Paulon). 
The  participle  with  pauomai  describes  what  they  were 
already  doing,  the  supplementary  participle  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  p.  1121).  They  stopped  before  the  job  was  over 
because  of  the  sudden  onset  of  the  Roman  soldiers.  Some 
ten  years  before  in  a  riot  at  the  passover  the  Roman  guard 
marched  down  and  in  the  panic  several  hundred  were 
trampled  to  death. 

33.  Came  near  {eggisas).  First  aorist  active  participle  of 
eggizo,  to  draw  near,  Koine  verb  from  eggus,  near,  and  com- 
mon in  the  N.T.  Laid  hold  on  him  {epelabeto  antou).  See  same 
verb  in  verse  30.  To  be  bound  (dethenai).  First  aorist  passive 
infinitive  of  deo  (see  verse  11).  With  two  chains  (halusesi 
dusi).  Instrumental  case  of  halusis,  old  word  from  a  priva- 
tive and  luo  (not  loosing,  i.e.  chaining).  With  two  chains 
as  a  violent  and  seditious  person,  probably  leader  of  a  band 
of  assassins  (verse  38).  See  on  Mark  54.  Inquired  {epun- 
thaneto).  Imperfect  middle  of  punthanomai,  old  and  common 
verb  used  mainly  by  Luke  in  the  N.T.  Lysias  repeated  his 
inquiries.  Who  he  was  {tis  eie).  Present  active  optative  of 
eimi  changed  from  estin  (present  indicative)  in  the  indirect 
question,  a  change  not  obligatory  after  a  past  tense,  but 
often  done  in  the  older  Greek,  rare  in  the  N.T.  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  p.  I043f.).  And  what  he  had  done  (kai  ti  estin  pepoi- 
ekos).  Periphrastic  perfect  active  indicative  of  poieo  here 
retained,  not  changed  to  the  optative  as  is  true  of  eie  from 
estin  in  the  same  indirect  question,  illustrating  well  the  free- 
dom about  it. 

34.  Some  shouting  one  thing,  some  another  (alloi  alio  ti  epe- 
phonoun).  Same  idiom  of  alloi  alio  as  in  19:32  which  see.  The 
imperfect  of  epiphoneo,  to  call  out  to,  suits  well  the  idiom. 
This  old  verb  occurs  in  the  N.T.  only  in  Luke  and  Acts 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  381 

(already  in  12:22).  When  he  could  not  know  {me  dunamenou 
autou  gnonai).  Genitive  absolute  of  present  middle  participle 
of  dunamai  with  negative  me  and  second  aorist  active  infini- 
tive of  ginosko.  The  certainty  {to  asphales).  Neuter  articular 
adjective  from  a  privative  and  sphalloy  to  make  totter  or  fall. 
Old  word,  in  the  N.T.  only  in  Acts  21:34;  22:30;  25:26; 
Phil.  3:1;  Heb.  6:19.  Into  the  castle  {eis  ten  parembolen). 
KoinS  word  from  paremballo,  to  cast  in  by  the  side  of,  to 
assign  soldiers  a  place,  to  encamp  (see  on  Luke  19:43).  So 
parembole  comes  to  mean  an  interpolation,  then  an  army 
drawn  up  (Heb.  11:34),  but  mainly  an  encampment  (Heb. 
13:11,  13),  frequent  in  Polybius  and  LXX.  So  here  barracks 
of  the  Roman  soldiers  in  the  tower  of  Antonia  as  in  verse  37; 
22:24;  23:10,  16,  32. 

35.  Upon  the  stairs  {epi  tous  anahathmous).  From  ana^  up, 
and  baino,  to  go.  Late  word,  in  LXX  and  KoinS  writers. 
In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  verse  40.  So  it  was  {sunebe). 
Second  aorist  active  of  sumbaino,  to  happen  (see  on  20:19) 
with  infinitive  clause  as  subject  here  as  often  in  the  old 
Greek.  He  was  borne  {bastazesthai  auton).  Accusative  of 
general  reference  with  this  subject  infinitive,  present  passive 
of  bastazo,  to  take  up  with  the  hands,  literally  as  here.  Vio- 
lence {bian).  See  on  Acts  5:26.  Biazo,  to  use  force,  is  from 
hia. 

36.  Followed  after  {ekolouthei) .  Imperfect  active  of  ako- 
lutheoj  was  following.  Cheated  of  their  purpose  to  lynch 
Paul,  they  were  determined  to  have  his  blood.  Crying  out 
{krazontes).  Construction  according  to  sense,  plural  mascu- 
line participle  agreeing  with  neuter  singular  substantive 
plethos  (Robertson,  Grammar^  p.  401).  Away  with  him  {Aire 
auton).  The  very  words  used  by  the  mob  to  Pilate  when  they 
chose  Barabbas  in  preference  to  Jesus  (Luke  23  :i8,  Aire  tou- 
ton).  He  will  hear  it  again  from  this  same  crowd  (Acts  22 :22). 
It  is  the  present  imperative  {aire)  as  in  Luke  23  :i8,  but  some 
may  have  used  the  urgent  aorist  active  imperative  as  also 


382      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

in  the  case  of  Jesus  (John  19:15,  dron,  droit  with  stauroson 
added).  Luke  does  not  say  that  this  mob  demanded  crucifix- 
ion for  Paul.  He  was  learning  what  it  was  to  share  the  suffer- 
ings of  Christ  as  the  sullen  roar  of  the  mob's  yells  rolled  on 
and  on  in  his  ears. 

37.  May  I  say  something  unto  thee?  {Ei  exestin  moi  eipein 
ti  pros  se?).  On  this  use  of  ei  in  a  direct  question  see  on  i  :6. 
The  calm  self-control  of  Paul  in  the  presence  of  this  mob 
is  amazing.  His  courteous  request  to  Lysias  was  in  Greek  to 
the  chiliarch's  amazement.  Dost  thou  know  Greek?  {Hel- 
lenisti  ginoskeis?).  Old  Greek  adverb  in  -i  from  Hellenizo, 
meaning  "in  Greek."  "Do  you  know  it  in  Greek?"  In  the 
N.T.  only  here  and  John  19:20.  Art  thou  not  then  the  Egyp- 
tian? (Ouk  ara  su  ei  ho  Aiguptios?).  Expects  the  answer  Yes 
and  ara  argues  the  matter  (therefore).  The  well-known  {ho) 
Egyptian  who  had  given  the  Romans  so  much  trouble. 
Stirred  up  to  sedition  (anastatosas).  First  aorist  active  par- 
ticiple of  anastatoo,  a  late  verb  from  anastatos,  outcast,  and 
so  to  unsettle,  to  stir  up,  to  excite,  once  known  only  in  LXX 
and  Acts  17:6  (which  see);  21:38;  Gal.  5:12,  but  now  found 
in  several  papyri  examples  with  precisely  this  sense  to  upset. 
Of  the  Assassins  {ton  sikarion).  Latin  word  sicarius,  one 
who  carried  a  short  sword  sica  under  his  cloak,  a  cutthroat. 
Josephus  uses  this  very  word  for  bands  of  robbers  under  this 
Egyptian  {fVar  II.  17,  6  and  13,  5;  Ant.  XX.  8,  10).  Jose- 
phus says  that  there  were  30,000  who  gathered  on  the  Mount 
of  Olives  to  see  the  walls  of  Jerusalem  fall  down  and  not 
merely  4,000  as  Lysias  does  here.  But  Lysias  may  refer  to 
the  group  that  were  armed  thus  (banditti)  the  core  of  the 
mob  of  30,000.  Lysias  at  once  saw  by  Paul's  knowledge  of 
Greek  that  he  was  not  the  famous  Egyptian  who  led  the 
Assassins  and  escaped  himself  when  Felix  attacked  and  slew 
the  most  of  them. 

39.  /  am  {Ego  men  eimi).  In  contrast  with  the  wild  guess 
of  Lysias  Paul  uses  men  and  de.    He  tells  briefly  who  he  is: 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  383 

a  Jew  (loudaios)  by  race,  of  Tarsus  in  Cilicia  {Tar sens  Us 
Kilikias)  by  country,  belonging  to  Tarsus  (this  adjective 
Tarseus  only  here  and  Acts  9:11),  and  proud  of  it,  one  of  the 
great  cities  of  the  empire  with  a  great  university.  A  citizen 
of  no  mean  city  (ouk  asemou  poleos  polite s).  Litotes  again, 
"no  mean"  {asemos,  old  adjective,  unmarked,  a  privative 
and  sema,  mark,  insignificant,  here  only  in  the  N.T.).  This 
same  litotes  used  by  Euripides  of  Athens  {Ion  8).  But  Paul 
calls  himself  a  citizen  {polites)  of  Tarsus.  Note  the  "effective 
assonance"  (Page)  in  poleos  polites.  Paul  now  {de)  makes  his 
request  {deomai)  of  Lysias.  Give  me  leave  {epitrepson  moi). 
First  aorist  active  imperative  of  epitrepb,  old  and  common 
verb  to  turn  to,  to  permit,  to  allow.  It  was  a  strange  re- 
quest and  a  daring  one,  to  wish  to  speak  to  this  mob  howling 
for  Paul's  blood. 

40.  When  he  had  given  him  leave  {epitrepsantos  autou). 
Genitive  absolute  of  aorist  active  participle  of  the  same  verb 
epitrepo.  Standing  on  the  stairs  {hestos  epi  ton  anahathmon) . 
Second  perfect  active  participle  of  histemi,  to  place,  but  in- 
transitive to  stand.  Dramatic  scene.  Paul  had  faced  many 
audiences  and  crowds,  but  never  one  quite  like  this.  Most 
men  would  have  feared  to  speak,  but  not  so  Paul.  He  will 
speak  about  himself  only  as  it  gives  him  a  chance  to  put 
Christ  before  this  angry  Jewish  mob  who  look  on  Paul  as  a 
renegade  Jew,  a  turncoat,  a  deserter,  who  went  back  on 
Gamaliel  and  all  the  traditions  of  his  people,  who  not  only 
turned  from  Judaism  to  Christianity,  but  who  went  after 
Gentiles  and  treated  Gentiles  as  if  they  were  on  a  par  with 
Jews.  Paul  knows  only  too  well  what  this  mob  thinks  of  him. 
Beckoned  with  the  hand  {kateseise  tei  cheiri).  He  shook  down 
to  the  multitude  with  the  hand  (instrumental  case  cheiri)^ 
while  Alexander,  Luke  says  (19:33),  "shook  down  the  hand" 
(accusative  with  the  same  verb,  which  see).  In  26:1  Paul 
reached  out  the  hand  {ekteinas  ten  cheira).  When  there  was 
made  a  great  silence  {polles  siges  genomenes).    Genitive  abso-

lute  again  with  second  aorist  middle  participle  of  ginomai, 
"much  silence  having  come."  Paul  waited  till  silence  had 
come.  In  the  Hebrew  language  {tei  Ehraidi  dialektoi).  The 
Aramaean  which  the  people  in  Jerusalem  knew  better  than 
the  Greek.  Paul  could  use  either  tongue  at  will.  His  enemies 
had  said  in  Corinth  that  "his  bodily  presence  was  weak 
and  his  speech  contemptible"  (II  Cor.  10:10).  But  surely 
even  they  would  have  to  admit  that  Paul's  stature  and  words 
reach  heroic  proportions  on  this  occasion.  Self-possessed 
with  majestic  poise  Paul  faces  the  outraged  mob  beneath 
the  stairs. 


CHAPTER  XXII 

I.  Brethren  and  fathers  {Andres  adelphoi  kai  pater es). 
Men,  brethren,  and  fathers.  The  very  language  used  by- 
Stephen  (7:2)  when  arraigned  before  the  Sanhedrin  with 
Paul  then  present.  Now  Paul  faces  a  Jewish  mob  on  the 
same  charges  brought  against  Stephen.  These  words  are 
those  of  courtesy  and  dignity  {amoris  et  honoris  nomina, 
Page).  These  men  were  Paul's  brother  Jews  and  were  (many 
of  them)  official  representatives  of  the  people  (Sanhedrists, 
priests,  rabbis).  Paul's  purpose  is  conciliatory,  he  employs 
"his  ready  tact"  (Rackham).  The  defence  which  I  now 
make  unto  you  {mou  tes  pros  humas  nuni  apologias).  Literally, 
My  defence  to  you  at  this  time.  Nuni  is  a  sharpened  form 
(by  -i)  of  nun  (now),  just  now.  The  term  apologia  (apology) 
is  not  our  use  of  the  word  for  apologizing  for  an  offence,  but 
the  original  sense  of  defence  for  his  conduct,  his  life.  It  is  an 
old  word  from  apologeomai,  to  talk  oneself  off  a  charge,  to 
make  defence.  It  occurs  also  in  Acts  25:16  and  then  also  in 
I  Cor.  9:3;  II  Cor.  7:11;  Phil.  1:7,  16;  II  Tim.  4:16;  I  Peter 
3:15.  Paul  uses  it  again  in  Acts  25:16  as  here  about  his  de- 
fence against  the  charges  made  by  the  Jews  from  Asia.  He 
is  suspected  of  being  a  renegade  from  the  Mosaic  law  and 
charged  with  specific  acts  connected  with  the  alleged  pro- 
fanation of  the  temple.  So  Paul  speaks  in  Aramaic  and  re- 
cites the  actual  facts  connected  with  his  change  from  Judaism 
to  Christianity.  The  facts  make  the  strongest  argument.  He 
first  recounts  the  well-known  story  of  his  zeal  for  Judaism 
in  the  persecution  of  the  Christians  and  shows  why  t-he 
change  came.  Then  he  gives  a  summary  of  his  work  among 
the  Gentiles  and  why  he  came  to  Jerusalem  this  time.  He 
answers  the  charge  of  enmity  to  the  people  and  the  law  and  of

desecration  of  the  temple.  It  is  a  speech  of  great  skill  and 
force,  delivered  under  remarkable  conditions.  The  one  in 
chapter  26  covers  some  of  the  same  ground,  but  for  a  slightly 
different  purpose  as  we  shall  see.  For  a  discussion  of  the 
three  reports  in  Acts  of  Paul's  conversion  see  chapter  9. 
Luke  has  not  been  careful  to  make  every  detail  correspond, 
though  there  is  essential  agreement  in  all  three. 

2.  He  spake  (prosephonei).  Imperfect  active,  was  speaking. 
See  aorist  active  prosephonesen  in  21 :40.  They  were  the  more 
quiet  (mdllon  pareschon  hesuchian).  Literally,  The  more 
{mdllon)  they  furnished  or  supplied  (second  aorist  active 
indicative  of  parecho)  quietness  {hesuchian,  old  word,  in 
the  N.T.  only  here  and  II  Thess.  3:12;  I  Tim.  2:1  iff.). 
Precisely  this  idiom  occurs  in  Plutarch  {Cor.  18)  and  the 
LXX  (Job  34:29).  Knowling  notes  the  fondness  of  Luke  for 
words  of  silence  {sige,  sigao,  hesuchazo)  as  in  Luke  14:4; 
15:26;  Acts  11:18;  12:17;  15-12;  21:14,  40.  It  is  a  vivid 
picture  of  the  sudden  hush  that  swept  over  the  vast  mob 
under  the  spell  of  the  Aramaic.  They  would  have  under- 
stood Paul's  Koine  Greek,  but  they  much  preferred  the 
Aramaic.  It  was  a  masterstroke. 

3.  /  am  a  Jew  {Ego  eimi  aner  loudaios).  Note  use  of  Ego 
for  emphasis.  Paul  recounts  his  Jewish  advantages  or 
privileges  with  manifest  pride  as  in  Acts  26:4^ ;  II  Cor. 
11:22;  Gal.  1:14;  Phil.  3:4-7.  Born  {gegennemenos).  Perfect 
passive  participle  of  gennao.  See  above  in  21:39  for  the 
claim  of  Tarsus  as  his  birth-place.  He  was  a  Hellenistic 
Jew,  not  an  Aramaean  Jew  (cf.  Acts  6:1).  Brought  up  {anate- 
thrammenos) .  Perfect  passive  participle  again  of  anatrepho, 
to  nurse  up,  to  nourish  up,  common  old  verb,  but  in  the  N.T. 
only  here,  7:2oflF.,  and  MSS.  in  Luke  4:16.  The  implication 
is  that  Paul  was  sent  to  Jerusalem  while  still  young,  "from 
my  youth"  (26:4),  how  young  we  do  not  know,  possibly  thir- 
teen or  fourteen  years  old.  He  apparently  had  not  seen 
Jesus  in  the  flesh  (II  Cor.  5:16).    Jt  the  feet  of  Gamaliel  {pros

tous  podas  Gamaliel).  The  rabbis  usually  sat  on  a  raised  seat 
with  the  pupils  in  a  circle  around  either  on  lower  seats  or 
on  the  ground.  Paul  was  thus  nourished  in  Pharisaic  Juda- 
ism as  interpreted  by  Gamaliel,  one  of  the  lights  of  Judaism. 
For  remarks  on  Gamaliel  see  chapter  5 :34fF.  He  was  one  of 
the  seven  Rabbis  to  whom  the  Jews  gave  the  highest  title 
Rabhan  (our  Rabbi).  Rabbi  (my  teacher)  was  next,  the 
lowest  being  Rab  (teacher).  "As  Aquinas  among  the  school- 
men was  called  Doctor  Angelicus,  and  Bonaventura  Doctor 
Seraphicus,  so  Gamaliel  was  called  the  Beauty  of  the  Law^^ 
(Conybeare  and  Howson),  Instructed  (pepaideumenos). 
Perfect  passive  participle  again  (each  participle  beginning  a 
clause),  this  time  of  paideud,  old  verb  to  train  a  child  (pais) 
as  in  7:22  which  see.  In  this  sense  also  in  I  Tim.  1:20;  Tit. 
2:12.  Then  to  chastise  as  in  Luke  23:16,  22  (which  see); 
n  Tim.  2:25;  Heb.  I2:6f.  According  to  the  strict  manner  (kata 
akribeian).  Old  word,  only  here  in  N.T.  Mathematical 
accuracy,  minute  exactness  as  seen  in  the  adjective  In  26:5. 
See  also  Rom.  10:2;  Gal.  1:4;  Phil.  3:4-7.  Of  our  fathers 
(patroiou).  Old  adjective  from  pater,  only  here  and  24:14 
in  N.T.  Means  descending  from  father  to  son,  especially 
property  and  other  inherited  privileges.  Patrikos  (patrician) 
refers  more  to  personal  attributes  and  affiliations.  Being 
zealous  for  God  {zelotes  huparchon  tou  theou).  Not  adjective, 
but  substantive  zealot  (same  word  used  by  James  of  the 
thousands  of  Jewish  Christians  in  Jerusalem,  21:20  which 
see)  with  objective  genitive  tou  theou  (for  God).  See  also 
verse  14;  28:17;  H  Tim.  1:3  where  he  makes  a  similar  claim. 
So  did  Peter  (Acts  3:13;  5:30)  and  Stephen  (7:32).  Paul 
definitely  claims,  whatever  freedom  he  demanded  for  Gentile 
Christians,  to  be  personally  "a  zealot  for  God"  "even  as  ye 
all  are  this  day"  {kathos  pantes  humeis  este  semeron).  In 
his  conciliation  he  went  to  the  limit  and  puts  himself  by  the 
side  of  the  mob  in  their  zeal  for  the  law,  mistaken  as  they 
were  about  him.    He  was  generous  surely  to  interpret  their 


388      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

fanatical  frenzy  as  zeal  for  God.    But  Paul  is  sincere  as  he 
proceeds  to  show  by  appeal  to  his  own  conduct. 

4.  And  I  (hos).  I  who,  literally.  This  Way  {tauten  ten 
hodon).  The  very  term  used  for  Christianity  by  Luke  con- 
cerning Paul's  persecution  (9:2),  which  see.  Here  it  "avoids 
any  irritating  name  for  the  Christian  body"  (Furneaux)  by 
using  this  Jewish  terminology.  Unto  the  death  {achri  thana- 
tou).  Unto  death,  actual  death  of  many  as  26:10  shows. 
Both  men  and  women  {andras  ie  kai  gunaikas).  Paul  felt 
ashamed  of  this  fact  and  it  was  undoubtedly  in  his  mind 
when  he  pictured  his  former  state  as  "a  blasphemer,  and  a 
persecutor,  and  injurious  (I  Tim.  i  :I3),  the  first  of  sinners** 
(I  Tim.  1:15).  But  it  showed  the  lengths  to  which  Paul 
went  in  his  zeal  for  Judaism. 

5.  Doth  bear  me  witness  {marturei  moi).  Present  active  in- 
dicative as  if  still  living.  Caiaphas  was  no  longer  high  priest 
now,  for  Ananias  is  at  this  time  (23:2),  though  he  may  be 
still  alive.  All  the  estate  of  the  elders  {pan  to  presbuterion). 
All  the  eldership  or  the  Sanhedrin  (4:5)  of  which  Paul  was 
probably  then  a  member  (26:10).  Possibly  some  of  those 
present  were  members  of  the  Sanhedrin  then  (some  20  odd 
years  ago).  From  whom  {par'  hon).  The  high  priest  and  the 
Sanhedrin.  Letters  unto  the  brethren  {epistalas  pros  tous 
adelphous) .  Paul  still  can  tactfully  call  the  Jews  his  "broth- 
ers" as  he  did  in  Rom.  9:3.  There  is  no  bitterness  in  his 
heart.  Journeyed  (eporeuomen) .  Imperfect  middle  indicative 
of  poreuomai,  and  a  vivid  reality  to  Paul  still  as  he  was  going 
on  towards  Damascus.  To  bring  also  (axon  kai).  Future 
active  participle  of  ago,  to  express  purpose,  one  of  the  few 
N.T.  examples  of  this  classic  idiom  (Robertson,  Grammar, 
p.  1 1 18).  Them  which  were  there  {tous  ekeise  ontas).  Con- 
structio  praegnans.  The  usual  word  would  be  ekei  (there), 
not  ekeise  (thither).  Possibly  the  Christians  who  had  fled  to 
Damascus,  and  so  were  there  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  548). 
In  bonds  {dedemenous) .     Perfect  passive  participle  of  deo. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  389 

predicate  position,  "bound."  For  to  he  punished  {hina 
timbrethosin) .  First  aorist  passive  subjunctive  of  timoreo, 
old  verb  to  avenge,  to  take  vengeance  on.  In  the  N.T.  only 
here,  and  26:11.  Pure  final  clause  with /if wa.  He  carried  his 
persecution  outside  of  Palestine  just  as  later  he  carried  the 
gospel  over  the  Roman  empire. 

6.  And  it  came  to  pass  {egeneto  de) .  Rather  than  the  common 
kai  egeneto  and  with  the  infinitive  (periastrapsai),  one  of  the 
three  constructions  with  kai  (de)  egeneto  by  Luke  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  pp.  I042f.),  followed  by  kai,  by  finite  verb,  by  sub- 
ject infinitive  as  here.  As  I  made  my  journey  (moi  poreuome- 
noi).  To  me  (dative  after  egeneto,  happened  to  me)  journey- 
ing (participle  agreeing  with  moi).  See  this  same  idiom  in 
verse  17.  Luke  uses  egeneto  de  seventeen  times  in  the  gospel 
and  twenty-one  in  the  Acts.  Unto  Damascus  [tei  Damaskbi). 
Dative  after  eggizonti  (drawing  nigh  to).  About  noon  [peri 
mesembrian).  Mid  (mesos)  day  (hemera),  old  word,  in  the 
N.T.  only  here  and  8:26  which  see  where  it  may  mean  "to- 
ward the  south."  An  item  not  in  ch.  9.  Shone  round  about  me 
(periastrapsai  peri  erne).  First  aorist  active  infinitive  oi peri- 
astrapto,  to  flash  around,  in  LXX  and  late  Greek,  in  the  N.T. 
only  here  and  9:3  which  see.  Note  repetition  oi  peri.  A  great 
light  (phos  hikanon).  Luke's  favourite  word  hikanon  (consid- 
erable). Accusative  of  general  reference  with  the  infinitive. 

7.  I  fell  (epesa).  Second  aorist  active  indicative  with  -a 
rather  than  epeson,  the  usual  form  of  pipto.  Unto  the  ground 
(eis  to  edaphos).  Old  word,  here  alone  in  N.T.  So  the  verb 
edaphizb,  is  in  Luke  19:44  alone  in  the  N.T.  A  voice  saying 
{phones  legouses).  Genitive  after  ekousa,  though  in  26:14  the 
accusative  is  used  after  ekousa,  as  in  22:14  after  akousai, 
either  being  allowable.  See  on  9:7  for  discussion  of  the 
difference  in  case.  Saul's  name  repeated  each  time  (9:4; 
22:7;  26:14).  Same  question  also  in  each  report:  "Why 
persecuted  thou  me?''  {Ti  me  dibkeis?).  These  piercing  words 
stuck  in  Paul's  mind. 


390      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

8.  Oj  Nazareth  {ho  Nazoraios).  The  Nazarene,  not  in  9:5 
or  26:15  and  here  because  Jesus  is  mentioned  now  for  the 
first  time  in  the  address.  The  form  Nazoraios  as  in  Matt. 
2:23  (which  see)  is  used  also  in  24:5  for  the  followers  of 
Jesus  instead  of  Nazarenos  as  in  Mark  1 124,  etc.  (which 
see). 

9.  But  they  heard  not  the  voice  {ten  de  phonen  ouk  ekousan). 
The  accusative  here  may  be  used  rather  than  the  genitive 
as  in  verse  7  to  indicate  that  those  with  Paul  did  not  under- 
stand what  they  heard  (9:7)  just  as  they  beheld  the  light 
(22:9),  but  did  not  see  Jesus  (9:7).  The  difference  in  cases 
allows  this  distinction,  though  it  is  not  always  observed  as 
just  noticed  about  22:14  and  26:14.  The  verb  akouo  is  used 
in  the  sense  of  understand  (Mark  4:33;  I  Cor.  14:2).  It  is 
one  of  the  evidences  of  the  genuineness  of  this  report  of 
Paul's  speech  that  Luke  did  not  try  to  smooth  out  apparent 
discrepancies  in  details  between  the  words  of  Paul  and  his 
own  record  already  in  ch.  9.  The  Textus  Receptus  adds  in 
this  verse:  "And  they  became  afraid"  {kai  emphoboi  ege- 
nonto).     Clearly  not  genuine. 

10.  Into  Damascus  {eis  Damaskon).  In  9:6  simply  "into 
the  city  "  {eis  ten  polin).  Of  all  things  which  {peri  pant  on  hon). 
Hon,  relative  plural  attracted  to  genitive  of  antecedent  from 
accusative  ha,  object  of  poiesai  {do).  Are  appointed  jor  thee 
{tetaktai  soi).  Perfect  passive  indicative  of  tasso,  to  appoint, 
to  order,  with  dative  soi.  Compare  with  hoti  se  dei  of  9:6. 
The  words  were  spoken  to  Paul,  of  course,  in  the  Aramaic, 
Saoul,  Saoul. 

11.  /  could  not  see  {ouk  enehlepon).  Imperfect  active  of 
emhlepo,  I  was  not  seeing,  same  fact  stated  in  9:8.  Here  the 
reason  as  "for  the  glory  of  that  light"  {apo  tes  doxes  tou 
photos  ekeinou).  Being  led  by  the  hand  {cheiragogoumenos). 
Present  passive  participle  of  cheiragogeo,  the  same  verb  used 
in  9:8  {cheiragogountes)  which  see.  Late  verb,  in  the  N.T. 
only  in  these  two  places.    In  LXX. 


I 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  391 

12.  ^  devout  man  according  to  the  law  (eulabes  kata  ton 
nomon).  See  on  2:5;  8:2;  Luke  2:25  for  the  adjective  eulabes. 
Paul  adds  "according  to  the  law"  to  show  that  he  was  in- 
troduced to  Christianity  by  a  devout  Jew  and  no  law- 
breaker (Lewin). 

13.  /  looked  up  on  him  {anahlepsa  eis  auton).  First  aorist 
active  indicative  and  same  word  as  anablepson  (Receive  thy 
sight).  Hence  here  the  verb  means  as  the  margin  of  the 
Revised  Version  has  it:  "I  received  my  sight  and  looked  upon 
him."    For  "look  up"  see  John  9:11. 

14.  Hath  appointed  thee  (proecheirisato).  First  aorist 
middle  indicative  of  procheirizo,  old  verb  to  put  forth  into 
one's  hands,  to  take  into  one's  hands  beforehand,  to  plan, 
propose,  determine.  In  the  N.T.  only  in  Acts  3:20;  22:14; 
26:16.  Three  infinitives  after  this  verb  of  God's  purpose 
about  Paul:  to  know  (gnonai^  second  aorist  active  of  ginosko) 
his  will,  to  see  {idein,  second  aorist  active  of  horao)  the 
Righteous  One  (cf.  3:14),  to  hear  {akousaij  first  aorist  active 
of  akouo)  a  voice  from  his  mouth. 

15.  A  witness  for  him  (martus  autoi).  As  in  1:8.  Of  what 
Qion).  Attraction  of  the- accusative  relative  ha  to  the  geni- 
tive case  of  the  unexpressed  antecedent  touton.  Thou  hast 
seen  and  heard  (heorakas,  present  perfect  active  indicative 
kai  ekousas,  first  aorist  active  indicative).  This  subtle  change 
of  tense  is  not  preserved  in  the  English.  Blass  properly  cites 
the  perfect  hedraka  in  I  Cor.  9:1  as  proof  of  Paul's  enduring 
qualification  for  the  apostleship. 

16.  Be  baptized  (baptisai).  First  aorist  middle  (causative), 
not  passive,  Get  thyself  baptized  (Robertson,  Grammar, 
p.  808).  Cf.  I  Cor.  10:2.  Submit  yourself  to  baptism.  So  as  to 
apolousai,  Get  washed  off  as  in  I  Cor.  6:11.  It  is  possible,  as 
in  2:38,  to  take  these  words  as  teaching  baptismal  remission 
or  salvation  by  means  of  baptism,  but  to  do  so  is  in  my 
opinion  a  complete  subversion  of  Paul's  vivid  and  pictur- 
esque language.    As  in  Rom.  6:4-6  where  baptism  is  the 


392      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

picture  of  death,  burial  and  resurrection,  so  here  baptism 
pictures  the  change  that  had  already  taken  place  when 
Paul  surrendered  to  Jesus  on  the  way  (verse  lo).  Baptism 
here  pictures  the  washing  away  of  sins  by  the  blood  of  Christ. 

17.  When  I  had  returned  {mot  hupostrepsanti),  while  I 
prayed  (proseuchomenou  mou),  I  fell  {genesthai  me).  Note 
dative  mot  with  egeneto  as  in  verse  6,  genitive  mou  (genitive 
absolute  with  proseuchomenou) ,  accusative  of  general  refer- 
ence me  with  genesthai,  and  with  no  effort  at  uniformity, 
precisely  as  in  15:22  and  23  which  see.  The  participle  is 
especially  liable  to  such  examples  of  anacolutha  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  p.  439). 

18.  Saw  him  saying  (ideiri  auton  legonta).  The  first  visit 
after  his  conversion  when  they  tried  to  kill  him  in  Jerusalem 
(9:29).    Because  {dioti,  dia  and  hoti),for  that. 

19.  Imprisoned  and  beat  {emen  phulakizon  kai  deron).  Peri- 
phrastic imperfect  active  of  phulakizo  (LXX  and  late  Koini, 
here  alone  in  the  N.T.)  and  dero  (old  verb  to  skin,  to  beat 
as  in  Matt.  21:35  which  see).  In  every  synagogue  {kata  tas 
sunagogas).   Up  and  down  (kata)  in  the  synagogues. 

20.  Was  shed  {exechunneto).  Imperfect  passive  of  (f^cAwnno 
(see  on  Matt.  23:35),  was  being  shed.  Witness  (marturos). 
And  "martyr"  also  as  in  Rev.  2:13;  17:6.  Transition  state 
for  the  word  here.  /  also  was  standing  by  (kai  autos  emen 
ephestos).  Periphrastic  second  past  perfect  in  form,  but  im- 
perfect (linear)  in  sense  since  hestos  =  histamenos  (intransi- 
tive). Consenting  (suneudokon).  The  very  word  used  by 
Luke  in  Acts  8:1  about  Paul.  KoinS  word  for  being  pleased 
at  the  same  time  with  (cf.  Luke  11 :48).  Paul  adds  here  the 
item  of  "guarding  the  clothes  of  those  who  were  slaying 
(anairounton  as  in  Luke  23:32;  Acts  12:2)  him"  (Stephen). 
Paul  recalls  the  very  words  of  protest  used  by  him  to  Jesus. 
He  did  not  like  the  idea  of  running  away  to  save  his  own 
life  right  where  he  had  helped  slay  Stephen.  He  is  getting 
on  dangerous  ground.  * 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  393 

21.  /  will  send  thee  forth  far  hence  unto  the  Gentiles  {Ego 
eis  ethne  makran  exapostelo  se).  Future  active  of  the  double 
{ex^  out,  apo^  off  or  away)  compound  of  exapostello,  common 
word  in  the  Koine  (cf.  Luke  24:49).  This  is  a  repetition  by 
Jesus  of  the  call  given  in  Damascus  through  Ananias  (9:15). 
Paul  had  up  till  now  avoided  the  word  Gentiles,  but  at  last 
it  had  to  come,  "the  fatal  word"  (Farrar). 

22.  They  gave  him  audience  (ekouon).  Imperfect  active, 
they  kept  on  listening,  at  least  with  respectful  attention. 
Unto  this  word  (achri  toutou  tou  logou).  But  "this  word" 
was  like  a  spark  in  a  powder  magazine  or  a  torch  to  an  oil 
tank.  The  explosion  of  pent-up  indignation  broke  out  in- 
stantly worse  than  at  first  (21:30).  Away  with  such  a  fellow 
from  the  earth  {Aire  apo  tes  ges  ton  toiouton).  They  renew  the 
cry  with  the  very  words  in  21 :36,  but  with  "from  the  earth" 
for  vehemence.  For  it  is  not  fit  {ou  gar  katheken).  Imperfect 
active  of  katheko,  old  verb  to  come  down  to,  to  become,  to 
fit.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Rom.  i  :28.  The  imperfect 
is  a  neat  Greek  idiom  for  impatience  about  an  obligation: 
It  was  not  fitting,  he  ought  to  have  been  put  to  death  long 
ago.  The  obligation  is  conceived  as  not  lived  up  to  like  our 
"ought"  (past  of  owe).    See  Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  886. 

23.  As  they  cried  out  {kraugazonton  auton).  Genitive 
absolute  with  present  active  participle  of  kraugazo,  a  rare 
word  in  the  old  Greek  from  krauge  (a  cry).  See  on  Matt. 
12:19.  Two  other  genitive  absolutes  here,  rhiptounton 
(throwing  off,  present  active  participle,  frequent  active 
variation  of  rhipto)  and  ballonton  (present  active  participle 
of  hallo,  flinging).  These  present  participles  give  a  lively 
picture  of  the  uncontrolled  excitement  of  the  mob  in  their 
spasm  of  wild  rage. 

24.  That  he  be  examined  by  scourging  {mastixin  anetazesthai 
auton).  The  present  passive  infinitive  of  anetazo  in  indirect 
command  after  eipas  (bidding).  This  verb  does  not  occur 
in  the  old  Greek  (which  used  exetazo  as  in  Matt.  2:8),  first 


394      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

in  the  LXX,  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  verse  29,  but  Miiiigan 
and  Moulton's  Vocabulary  quotes  an  Oxyrhynchus  papyrus 
of  A.D.  127  which  has  a  prefect  using  the  word  directing 
government  clerks  to  "examine"  {anetazein)  documents  and 
glue  them  together  into  volumes  (tomoi).  The  word  was 
evidently  in  use  for  such  purposes.  It  was  a  kind  of  "third 
degree"  applied  to  Paul  by  the  use  of  scourges  {mastixin), 
instrumental  plural  of  mastix,  old  word  for  whip,  as  in  Heb. 
11:36.  But  this  way  of  beginning  an  inquiry  by  torture 
(inquisition)  was  contrary  to  Roman  law  (Page) :  Non  esse  a 
tormentis  incipiendum,  Divus  Augustus  statuit.  That  he  might 
know  {hina  epignoi).  Final  clause  with  hina  and  second  aorist 
active  subjunctive  of  epignosko  (full  knowledge).  Lysias  was 
as  much  in  the  dark  as  ever,  for  Paul's  speech  had  been  in 
Aramaic  and  this  second  explosion  was  a  mystery  to  him  like 
the  first.  They  so  shouted  {houtbs  epephonoun).  Imperfect 
active  progressive  imperfect  had  been  so  shouting. 

25.  When  they  had  tied  him  up  {hos  proeteinan  autofi). 
First  aorist  active  indicative  of  proteino,  old  verb  to  stretch 
forward,  only  here  in  the  N.T.  Literally,  "When  they 
stretched  him  forward."  With  the  thongs  {tois  himasin).  If 
the  instrumental  case  of  himas,  old  word  for  strap  or  thong 
(for  sandals  as  Mark  1:7,  or  for  binding  criminals  as  here), 
then  Paul  was  bent  forward  and  tied  by  the  thongs  to  a  post 
in  front  to  expose  his  back  the  better  to  the  scourges.  But 
tois  himasin  may  be  dative  case  and  then  it  would  mean 
"for  the  lashes."  In  either  case  it  is  a  dreadful  scene  of  ter- 
rorizing by  the  chiliarch.  Unto  the  centurion  that  stood  by 
(pros  ton  hestota  hekatontarchon) .  He  was  simply  carrying 
out  the  orders  of  the  chiliarch  (cf.  Matt.  27:54).  Why  had 
not  Paul  made  protest  before  this.^  Is  it  lawful?  {ei  exestin?). 
This  use  of  ei  in  indirect  questions  we  have  had  before  (1:6). 
A  Roman  and  uncondemned  (Romaion  kai  akatakriton).  Just 
as  in  16:37  which  see.  Blass  says  of  Paul's  question:  Inter- 
rogatio  subironica  est  confidentiae  plena. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  395 

26.  What  art  thou  about  to  do?  (Ti  melleis  poiein?).  On 
the  point  of  doing,  sharp  warning. 

27.  Art  thou  a  Roman?  {Su  Romaios  ei?).  Thou  (emphatic 
position)  a  Roman?    It  was  unbelievable. 

28.  With  a  great  sum  (pollou  kephalaiou).  The  use  of 
kephalaiou  (from  kephale,  head)  for  sums  of  money  (principal 
as  distinct  from  interest)  is  old  and  frequent  in  the  papyri. 
Our  word  capitafis  from  caput  (head).  The  genitive  is  used 
here  according  to  rule  for  price.  "The  sale  of  the  Roman 
citizenship  was  resorted  to  by  the  emperors  as  a  means  of 
filling  the  exchequer,  much  as  James  I.  made  baronets" 
(Page).  Dio  Cassius  (LX.,  17)  tells  about  Messalina  the  wife 
of  Claudius  selling  Roman  citizenship.  Lysias  was  probably  a 
Greek  and  so  had  to  buy  his  citizenship.  But  I  am  a  Roman 
born  (Ego  de  kai  gegennemai).  Perfect  passive  indicative  of 
gennao.  The  word  "Roman"  not  in  the  Greek.  Literally, 
"But  I  have  been  even  born  one,"  (i.e.  born  a  Roman  citi- 
zen). There  is  calm  and  simple  dignity  in  this  reply  and  par- 
donable pride.  Being  a  citizen  of  Tarsus  (21:39)  did  not 
make  Paul  a  Roman  citizen.  Tarsus  was  an  urbs  libera^  not 
a  colonia  like  Philippi.  Some  one  of  his  ancestors  (father, 
grandfather)  obtained  it  perhaps  as  a  reward  for  distinguished 
service.  Paul's  family  was  of  good  social  position.  "He  was 
educated  by  the  greatest  of  the  Rabbis;  he  was  at  an  early 
age  entrusted  by  the  Jewish  authorities  with  an  important 
commission;  his  nephew  could  gain  ready  access  to  the 
Roman  tribune;  he  was  treated  as  a  person  of  consequence 
by  Felix,  Festus,  Agrippa,  and  Juhus"  (Furneaux). 

29.  Departed  from  him  (apestesan  ap^  autou).  Second 
aorist  active  indicative  (intransitive)  of  aphistemi,  stood 
oflF  from  him  at  once.  Was  afraid  (ephobethe).  Ingressive 
aorist  passive  indicative  of  phobeomai,  became  afraid.  He 
had  reason  to  be.  That  he  was  a  Roman  (hoti  Romaios  estin). 
Indirect  assertion  with  tense  of  estin  retained.  Because  he 
had  bound  him  {hoti  auton  en  dedekos).  Causal  hoti  here  after 


396      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

declarative  hoti  just  before.   Periphrastic  past  perfect  active 
of  deo,  to  bind. 

30.  To  know  the  certainty  (gnonai  to  asphales).  Same  idiom 
in  21:34  which  see.  Wherefore  he  was  accused  {to  ti  kate- 
goreitai).  Epexegetical  after  to  asphales.  Note  article  (ac- 
cusative case)  with  the  indirect  question  here  as  in  Luke 
22:1,  23,  24  (which  see),  a  neat  idiom  in  the  Greek.  Com- 
manded (ekeleusen).  So  the  Sanhedrin  had  to  meet,  but  in  the 
Tower  of  Antonia,  for  he  brought  Paul  down  {katagagon, 
second  aorist  active  participle  of  katago).  Set  him  (estesen). 
First  aorist  active  (transitive)  indicative  of  histemi,  not  the 
intransitive  second  aorist  este.  Lysias  is  determined  to  find 
out  the  truth  about  Paul,  more  puzzled  than  ever  by  the 
important  discovery  that  he  has  a  Roman  citizen  on  his 
hands  in  this  strange  prisoner. 


CHAPTER  XXIII 

I.  Looking  steadfastly  {atenisas).  See  on  this  word  i:io; 
3:12;  6:15;  7:5s;  13:9-  Paul  may  have  had  weak  eyes,  but 
probably  the  earnest  gaze  was  to  see  if  he  recognized  any 
faces  that  were  in  the  body  that  tried  Stephen  and  to  which 
he  apparently  once  belonged.  /  have  lived  before  God  {pepo- 
liteumai  tbi  thebi).  Perfect  middle  indicative  of  politeuo,  old 
verb  to  manage  affairs  of  city  (polis)  or  state,  to  be  a  citizen, 
behave  as  a  citizen.  In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Phil,  i  :2y. 
The  idea  of  citizenship  was  Greek  and  Roman,  not  Jewish. 
"He  had  lived  as  God's  citizen,  as  a  member  of  God's 
commonwealth"  (Rackham).  God  {thebi)  is  the  dative 
of  personal  interest.  As  God  looked  at  it  and  in  his  relation 
to  God.  In  all  good  conscience  unto  this  day  (pasei  suneidesei 
agathei  achri  tautes  tes  hemeras).  This  claim  seems  to  lack 
tact,  but  for  brevity's  sake  Paul  sums  up  a  whole  speech  in  it. 
He  may  have  said  much  more  than  Luke  here  reports  along 
the  line  of  his  speech  the  day  before,  but  Paul  did  not  make 
this  claim  without  consideration.  It  appears  to  contradict 
his  confession  as  the  chief  of  sinners  (I  Tim.  1:13-16).  But 
that  depends  on  one's  interpretation  of  "good  conscience." 
The  word  suneidesis  is  literally  "joint-knowledge"  in  Greek, 
Latin  (conscientia)  and  English  "conscience"  from  the  Latin. 
It  is  a  late  word  from  sunoida,  to  know  together,  common  in 
O.T.,  Apocrypha,  Philo,  Plutarch,  New  Testament,  Stoics, 
ecclesiastical  writers.  In  itself  the  word  simply  means  con- 
sciousne^ss  of  one's  own  thoughts  (Heb.  10:2),  or  of  one's 
own  self,  then  consciousness  of  the  distinction  between  right 
and  wrong  (Rom.  2:15)  with  approval  or  disapproval.  .But 
the  conscience  is  not  an  infallible  guide  and  acts  according 

397 


398      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

to  the  light  that  it  has  (I  Cor.  8:7,  10;  I  Peter  2:19).  The 
conscience  can  be  contaminated  (Heb.  10:22,  evil  ponerds). 
All  this  and  more  must  be  borne  in  mind  in  trying  to  under- 
stand Paul's  description  of  his  motives  as  a  persecutor. 
Alleviation  of  his  guilt  comes  thereby,  but  not  removal  of 
guilt  as  he  himself  felt  (I  Tim.  1:13-16).  He  means  to  say 
to  the  Sanhedrin  that  he  persecuted  Christians  as  a  con- 
scientious (though  mistaken)  Jew  (Pharisee)  just  as  he  fol- 
lowed his  conscience  in  turning  from  Judaism  to  Christianity. 
It  is  a  pointed  disclaimer  against  the  charge  that  he  is  a 
renegade  Jew,  an  opposer  of  the  law,  the  people,  the  temple. 
Paul  addresses  the  Sanhedrin  as  an  equal  and  has  no  "apol- 
ogies" (in  our  sense)  to  make  for  his  career  as  a  whole.  The 
golden  thread  of  consistency  runs  through,  as  a  good  citizen 
in  God's  commonwealth.  He  had  the  consolation  of  a  good 
conscience  (I  Peter  3:16).  The  word  does  not  occur  in  the 
Gospels  and  chiefly  in  Paul's  Epistles,  but  we  see  it  at  work 
in  John  8:9  (the  interpolation  7:53  to  8:11). 

2.  Ananias  {Hananias).  Not  the  one  in  Luke  3:2;  John 
18:13;  Acts  4:7,  but  the  son  of  Nebedaeus,  nominated  high 
priest  by  Herod,  King  of  Chalcis,  a.d.  48  and  till  a.d,  59. 
He  was  called  to  Rome  a.d.  52  to  answer  "a  charge  of  rapine 
and  cruelty  made  against  him  by  the  Samaritans,  but 
honourably  acquitted"  (Page).  Though  high  priest,  he  was 
a  man  of  bad  character.  Them  that  stood  by  him  {tois  pares- 
tosin  autoi).  Dative  case  of  second  perfect  participle  of 
paristemi,  to  place,  and  intransitive.  See  the  same  form  in 
verse  4  [parestotes).  To  smite  him  on  the  mouth  {tuptein  autou 
to  stoma).  See  on  12:45;  ^^^  18:17.  Cf.  the  treatment  of 
Jesus  (John  18:22).  Ananias  was  provoked  by  Paul's  self- 
assertion  while  on  trial  before  his  judges.  "The  act  was 
illegal  and  peculiarly  offensive  to  a  Jew  at  the  hands  of  a 
Jew"  (Knowling).  More  self-control  might  have  served 
Paul  better.  Smiting  the  mouth  or  cheek  is  a  peculiarly 
irritating  oflFence  and  one  not  uncommon  among  the  Jews 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  399 

and  this  fact  gives  point  to  the  command  of  Jesus  to  turn 
the  other  check  (Luke  6:29  where  tupto  is  also  used). 

3.  Thou  whited  wall  {toiche  kekoniamene) .  Perfect  passive 
participle  of  koniao  (from  konia,  dust  or  lime).  The  same 
word  used  in  Matt.  23:27  for  "whited  sepulchres"  {taphoi 
kekoniamenoi)  which  see.  It  is  a  picturesque  way  of  calling 
Ananias  a  hypocrite,  undoubtedly  true,  but  not  a  partic- 
ularly tactful  thing  for  a  prisoner  to  say  to  his  judge,  not  to 
say  Jewish  high  priest.  Besides,  Paul  had  hurled  back  at 
him  the  word  tuptein  {smite)  in  his  command,  putting  it 
first  in  the  sentence  {tuptein  se  mellei  ho  theos)  in  strong 
emphasis.  Clearly  Paul  felt  that  he,  not  Ananias,  was  living 
as  a  good  citizen  in  God's  commonwealth.  And  sittest  thou 
to  judge  me?  {Kai  su  kathei  krinon  me?)  Literally,  "And  thou 
(being  what  thou  art)  art  sitting  {kathei,  second  person 
singular  middle  of  kathemai,  late  form  for  kathesai,  the  un- 
contracted  form)  judging  me."  Cf.  Luke  22:30.  Kai  su 
at  the  beginning  of  a  question  expresses  indignation.  Con- 
trary to  the  law  {paranomon).  Present  active  participle  of 
paranomeo,  old  verb  to  act  contrary  to  the  law,  here  alone 
in  the  N.T.,  "acting  contrary  to  the  law." 

4.  Of  God  {tou  theou).  As  God's  representative  in  spite 
of  his  bad  character  (Deut.  I7:8f.).  Here  was  a  charge 
of  irreverence,  to  say  the  least.  The  office  called  for  re- 
spect. 

5.  /  wist  not  {ouk  eidein).  Second  past  perfect  of  oida 
used  as  an  imperfect.  The  Greek  naturally  means  that 
Paul  did  not  know  that  it  was  the  high  priest  who  gave  the 
order  to  smite  his  mouth.  If  this  view  is  taken,  several 
things  may  be  said  by  way  of  explanation.  The  high  priest 
may  not  have  had  on  his  official  dress  as  the  meeting  was 
called  hurriedly  by  Lysias.  Paul  had  been  away  so  long 
that  he  may  not  have  known  Ananias  on  sight.  And  then 
Paul  may  have  had  poor  eyesight  or  the  high  priest  may  not 
have  been  sitting  in  the  official  seat.    Another  way  of  ex- 


400      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

plaining  it  is  to  say  that  Paul  was  so  indignant,  even  angry, 
at  the  command  that  he  spoke  without  considering  who  it 
was  that  gave  the  order.  The  Greek  allows  this  idea  also. 
At  any  rate  Paul  at  once  recognizes  the  justice  of  the  point 
made  against  him.  He  had  been  guilty  of  irreverence  against 
the  office  of  high  priest  as  the  passage  from  Ex.  22:18  (LXX) 
shows  and  confesses  his  fault,  but  the  rebuke  was  deserved. 
Jesus  did  not  threaten  (I  Peter  2:23)  when  smitten  on  the 
cheek  (John  18:22),  but  he  did  protest  against  the  act  and 
did  not  turn  the  other  cheek. 

6.  But  when  Paul  perceived  {gnous  de  ho  Paulos).  Per- 
ceiving (second  aorist  ingressive  of  ginosko).  Paul  quickly 
saw  that  his  cause  was  ruined  before  the  Sanhedrin  by  his 
unwitting  attack  on  the  high  priest.  It  was  impossible  to 
get  a  fair  hearing.  Hence,  Vincent  says,  "Paul,  with  great 
tact,  seeks  to  bring  the  two  parties  of  the  council  into  col- 
lision with  each  other."  So  Alford  argues  with  the  motto 
"divide  and  conquer."  Farrar  condemns  Paul  and  takes 
24:21  as  a  confession  of  error  here,  but  that  is  reading  into 
Paul's  word  about  the  resurrection  more  than  he  says. 
Page  considers  Luke's  report  meagre  and  unsatisfactory. 
Rackham  thinks  that  the  trial  was  already  started  and  that 
Paul  repeated  part  of  his  speech  of  the  day  before  when 
"the  Sadducees  received  his  words  with  ostentatious  scepti- 
cism and  ridicule:  this  provoked  counter-expressions  of 
sympathy  and  credulity  among  the  Pharisees."  But  all 
this  is  inference.  We  do  not  have  to  adopt  the  Jesuitical 
principle  that  the  end  justifies  the  means  in  order  to  see 
shrewdness  and  hard  sense  in  what  Paul  said  and  did.  Paul 
knew,  of  course,  that  the  Sanhedrin  was  nearly  evenly 
divided  between  Pharisees  and  Sadducees,  for  he  himself 
had  been  a  Pharisee.  /  am  a  Pharisee,  a  son  of  Pharisees 
(Ego  Pharisaios  eimi  huios  Pharisaion).  This  was  strictly 
true  as  we  know  from  his  Epistles  (Phil.  3:5).  Touching  the 
hope  and  resurrection  of  the  dead  I  am  called  in  question  {peri 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  401 

elpidos  kai  anastaseos  nekron  krinomai).  This  was  true 
also  and  this  is  the  point  that  Paul  mentions  in  24:21.  His 
failure  to  mention  again  the  fact  that  he  was  a  Pharisee 
throws  no  discredit  on  Luke's  report  here.  The  chief  point 
of  difference  between  Pharisees  and  Sadducees  was  precisely 
this  matter  of  the  resurrection.  And  this  was  Paul's  cardinal 
doctrine  as  a  Christian  minister.  It  was  this  fact  that  con- 
vinced him  that  Jesus  was  the  Messiah  and  was  "the  very 
centre  of  his  faith  "  (Page)  and  of  his  preaching.  It  was  not  a 
mere  trick  for  Paul  to  proclaim  this  fact  here  and  so  divide 
the  Sanhedrin.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  Pharisees  held  aloof 
when  the  Sadducees  persecuted  Peter  and  the  other  apostles 
for  preaching  resurrection  in  the  case  of  Jesus  and  even 
Gamaliel  threw  cold  water  on  the  effort  to  punish  them 
for  it  (Acts  5:34-39).  So  then  Paul  was  really  recurring  to 
the  original  cleavage  on  this  point  and  was  able  to  score  a 
point  against  the  Sadducees  as  Gamaliel,  his  great  teacher, 
had  done  before  him.  Besides,  "Paul  and  Pharisaism  seem 
to  us  such  opposite  ideas  that  we  often  forget  that  to  Paul 
Christianity  was  the  natural  development  of  Judaism" 
(Page).    Paul  shows  this  in  Gal.  3  and  Rom.  9-1 1. 

7.  When  he  had  so  said  {touto  autou  lalountos).  Genitive 
absolute  of  present  participle  (Westcott  and  Hort)  rather 
than  aorist  (eipontos).  While  he  was  saying  this.  ^  dissension 
(stasis).  This  old  word  for  standing  or  station  (Heb.  9:8) 
from  histemi,  to  place,  we  have  seen  already  to  mean  insur- 
rection (Acts  19:40  which  see).  Here  it  is  strife  as  in  15:2. 
Was  divided  (eschisthe).    See  on  14:4. 

8.  There  is  no  resurrection,  neither  angel,  nor  spirit  {me 
einai  anastasin  mete  aggelon  mete  pneuma).  Infinitive  with 
negative  me  in  indirect  assertion.  These  points  constitute 
the  chief  doctrinal  differences  between  the  Pharisees  and 
the  Sadducees.  Both  (amphotera) .  Here  used  though  three 
items  of  belief  are  mentioned  as  in  19:16  where  the  seven 
sons  of  Sceva  are  thus  described.   This  idiom  is  common 


402      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

enough  in  papyri  and  Byzantine  Greek  (Robertson,  Gram- 
mar, p.  745). 

9.  Strove  {diemachonto) .  Imperfect  middle  of  diamachomai, 
old  Attic  verb,  to  fight  it  out  (between,  back  and  forth, 
fiercely).  Here  only  in  the  N.T.  It  was  a  lively  scrap  and 
Luke  pictures  it  as  going  on.  The  Pharisees  definitely  take 
Paul's  side.  And  what  if  a  spirit  hath  spoken  to  him  or  an 
angel?  {ei  de  pneuma  elalesen  autoi  e  aggelos?).  This  is  apo- 
siopesis,  not  uncommon  in  the  N.T.,  as  in  Luke  13:9;  John 
6:62  (Robertson,  Grammar ^  p.  1203).  See  one  also  in  Ex. 
32:32. 

10.  When  there  arose  a  great  dissension  {polles  tes  gino- 
menes  staseos).  Present  middle  participle  (genitive  absolute). 
Literally,  "dissension  becoming  much."  Lest  Paul  should 
be  torn  in  pieces  by  them  {me  diaspasthei  ho  Paulos).  First 
aorist  passive  subjunctive  of  diaspao,  to  draw  in  two,  to 
tear  in  pieces,  old  verb,  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Mark  5 14 
of  tearing  chains  in  two.  The  subjunctive  with  me  Is  the 
common  construction  after  a  verb  of  fearing  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  p.  995).  The  soldiers  {to  strateuma).  The  army, 
the  band  of  soldiers  and  so  in  verse  27.  To  go  down  {kataban). 
Second  aorist  active  participle  of  katabaino,  having  gone 
down.  Take  him  by  force  {harpasai).  To  seize.  The  soldiers 
were  to  seize  and  save  Paul  from  the  midst  of  {ek  me  sou) 
the  rabbis  or  preachers  (in  their  rage  to  get  at  each  other). 
Paul  was  more  of  a  puzzle  to  Lysias  now  than  ever. 

11.  The  night  following  {tei  epiousei  nukti).  Locative 
case,  on  the  next  (following)  night.  The  Lord  {ho  kurios). 
Jesus.  Paul  never  needed  Jesus  more  than  now.  On  a  pre- 
vious occasion  the  whole  church  prayed  for  Peter's  release 
(12:5),  but  Paul  clearly  had  no  such  grip  on  the  church  as 
that,  though  he  had  been  kindly  welcomed  (21:18).  In 
every  crisis  Jesus  appears  to  him  (cf.  Acts  18:9).  It  looked 
dark  for  Paul  till  Jesus  spoke.  Once  before  in  Jerusalem 
Jesus  spoke  words  of  cheer  (22:18).    Then  he  was  told  to 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  403 

leave  Jerusalem.  Now  he  Is  to  have  "cheer"  or  "courage" 
{tharsei).  Jesus  used  this  very  word  to  others  (Matt.  9:2, 
22;  Mark  10:49).  It  is  a  brave  word.  Thou  hast  testified  (die- 
marturo).  First  aorist  middle  indicative  second  person 
singular  of  diamarturomai,  strong  word  (see  on  22:18).  Must 
thou  {se  del).  That  is  the  needed  word  and  on  this  Paul 
leans.  His  hopes  (19:21)  of  going  to  Rome  will  not  be  in 
vain.  He  can  bide  Christ's  time  now.  And  Jesus  has  ap- 
proved his  witness  in  Jerusalem. 

12.  Banded  together  {poiesantes  sustrophen).  See  on  19:40 
(riot),  but  here  conspiracy,  secret  combination,  binding  to- 
gether like  twisted  cords.  Bound  themselves  under  a  curse 
{anethematisan  heautous).  First  aorist  active  indicative  of 
anathematizo,  a  late  word,  said  by  Cremer  and  Thayer  to 
be  wholly  Biblical  or  ecclesiastical.  But  Deissmann  {Light 
from  the  Ancient  East,  p.  95)  quotes  several  examples  of  the 
verb  in  an  Attic  cursing  tablet  from  Megara  of  the  first  or 
second  century  a.d.  This  proof  shows  that  the  word,  as  well 
as  anathema  (substantive)  from  which  the  verb  is  derived, 
was  employed  by  pagans  as  well  as  by  Jews.  Deissmann 
suggests  that  Greek  Jews  like  the  seven  sons  of  Sceva  may 
have  been  the  first  to  coin  it.  It  occurs  in  the  LXX  as  well 
as  Mark  14:71  (which  see  and  Luke  21:5);  Acts  23:12,  14, 
21.  They  placed  themselves  under  an  anathema  or  curse, 
devoted  themselves  to  God  (cf.  Lev.  27:28^;  I  Cor.  16:22). 
Drink  {pein  =  piein).  Second  aorist  active  infinitive  of 
pino.  For  this  shortened  form  see  Robertson,  Grammar ^ 
p.  343.  Till  they  had  killed  (heos  hou  apokteinbsin) .  First 
aorist  active  subjunctive  of  apokteino,  common  verb.  No 
reason  to  translate  "had  killed,"  simply  "till  they  should 
kill,"  the  aorist  merely  punctiliar  action,  the  subjunctive  re- 
tained instead  of  the  optative  for  vividness  as  usual  in  the 
Koine  (Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  974-6).  Same  construc- 
tion In  verse  14.  King  Saul  took  an  "anathema"  that 
imperilled  Jonathan  (I  Sam.  14:24).    Perhaps  the  forty  felt 


404      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

that  the  rabbis  could  find  some  way  to  absolve  the  curse 
if  they  failed.   See  this  verse  repeated  in  verse  21. 

13.  More  than  forty  {pleious  tesserakonta).  Without  "than" 
(?)  as  in  verse  21  and  24:11  and  often  in  the  ancient  Greek. 
Conspiracy  (sunomosian).  Old  word  from  sunomnumi,  to 
swear  together.   Only  here  in  the  N.T. 

14.  Came  to  the  chief  priests  and  the  elders  {proselthontes 
tois  archiereusin  kai  tois  preshuterois).  The  Sanhedrin,  just 
as  Judas  did  (Luke  22:4).  With  a  great  curse  {anathemati). 
This  use  of  the  same  word  as  the  verb  repeated  in  the  in- 
strumental case  is  in  imitation  of  the  Hebrew  absolute  infini- 
tive and  common  in  the  LXX,  the  very  idiom  and  words 
of  Deut.  13:15;  20:17,  an  example  of  translation  Greek, 
though  found  in  other  languages  (Robertson,  Grammar^ 
p.  531).  See  on  Luke  21:5  for  the  distinction  between  ana- 
thema and  anathema.  Jesus  had  foretold:  "Whoso  killeth 
you  will  think  that  he  doeth  God  service"  (John  16:2). 

15.  Ye  (humeis).  Emphatic.  Signify  (emphanisate).  First 
aorist  active  imperative  of  emphanizo.  Make  plain  from 
emphanes,  chiefly  in  Acts.  Repeated  in  verse  22.  The  author- 
ity is  with  the  chiliarch  not  with  the  Sanhedrin,  but  he  had 
appealed  to  the  Sanhedrin  for  advice.  As  though  ye  would 
judge  of  his  case  more  exactly  (hos  mellontas  diaginbskein 
akribesteron  ta  peri  autou).  Hos  with  the  participle  gives  the 
alleged  reason  as  here.  So  also  In  verse  20.  Diagnosko,  old 
verb  to  distinguish  accurately,  only  here  in  N.T.  and  24:22. 
Or  ever  come  near  {pro  tou  eggisai  auton).  "Before  the  coming 
near  as  to  him."  Pro  and  the  genitive  of  the  articular  infini- 
tive of  eggizo  with  accusative  of  general  reference.  We  are 
ready  to  slay  him  (hetoimoi  esmen  tou  anelein  auton).  Genitive 
of  purpose  of  the  articular  infinitive  after  the  adjective 
hetoimoi  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1061).  Anelein,  second 
aorist  active  of  anaireo. 

16.  Their  lying  in  wait  {ten  enedran).  Old  word  from  en 
(in)  and  hedra  (seal),  ambush.    In  N.T.  only  here  and  25:3. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  405 

Accusative  object  of  akousas.  He  came  {paragenomenos). 
Second  aorist  middle  participle  of  paraginomai.  It  may 
mean,  "having  come  upon  them"  and  so  discount  their 
plot,  a  graphic  touch.  Vincent  thinks  that  some  Pharisee, 
since  Paul  was  a  Pharisee  and  so  a  member  of  the  "guild," 
told  his  nephew  of  the  plot.  Perhaps,  and  perhaps  not. 
Told  Paul  {apeggeilen  tot  Paulbi).  This  nephew  is  not  known 
otherwise.  He  may  be  a  student  here  from  Tarsus  as  Paul 
once  was.  Anyhow  he  knows  what  to  do  when  he  catches 
on  to  the  conspirators.  He  had  enough  address  to  get  into 
the  barracks  where  Paul  was.  He  ran  the  risk  of  death  if 
discovered. 

17.  Called  unto  him  (proskalesamenos) .  First  aorist  parti- 
ciple indirect  middle,  calling  to  himself.  Paul  laid  his  plans 
as  energetically  as  if  Jesus  had  not  promised  that  he  would 
see  Rome  (23:11).    Bring  (apage).    "Take  away." 

18.  Paul  the  prisoner  {ho  desmios  Paulos).  Bound  {des- 
mios)  to  a  soldier,  but  not  with  two  chains  (21 133),  and  with 
some  freedom  to  see  his  friends  as  later  (28:16),  in  military 
custody  {custodia  militaris).  This  was  better  than  custodia 
puhlica  (public  custody),  the  common  prison,  but  more 
confining.  Who  hath  something  to  say  to  thee  {echonta  ti 
lalesai  soi).  Same  idiom  as  in  verse  17  and  in  19,  but  lalesai 
here  instead  of  apaggeilai. 

19.  7*00^  him  hy  the  hand  {epilahomenos  tes  cheiros  autou). 
Kindly  touch  in  Lysias,  ut  fiduciam  adolescentis  confirmaret 
(Bengel).  Note  genitive  with  the  second  aorist  middle  (in- 
direct, to  himself)  of  epilambano  as  in  Luke  8 :54  with  kratesas 
which  see.  How  old  the  young  man  (neanias)  was  we  do  not 
know,  but  it  is  the  very  word  used  of  Paul  in  7:58  when  he 
helped  in  the  killing  of  Stephen,  a  young  man  in  the  twenties 
probably.  See  also  20:9  of  Eutychus.  He  is  termed  neaniskos 
in  verse  22.  Asked  him  privately  {kaf  idian  epunthaneto). 
Imperfect  middle,  began  to  ask  (inchoative). 

20.  The  Jews  {hoi  loudaioi).  As  if  the  whole  nation  was  in

the  conspiracy  and  so  in  verse  12.  The  conspirators  may 
have  belonged  to  the  Zealots,  but  clearly  they  represented  the 
state  of  Jewish  feeling  toward  Paul  in  Jerusalem.  Have 
agreed  {sunethento).  Second  aorist  middle  indicative  of 
suntithemiy  old  verb  to  join  together,  to  agree.  Already  this 
form  in  Luke  22:5  which  see.  See  also  John  9:22;  Acts  24:9. 
To  bring  down  {hopbs  katagageis).  Very  words  of  the  con- 
spirators in  verse  15  as  if  the  young  man  overheard.  Second 
aorist  active  subjunctive  of  katago  with  hopds  in  final  clause, 
still  used,  but  nothing  like  so  common  as  hina  though  again 
in  verse  23  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  985).  As  though  thou 
tvouldest  inquire  (hos  mellon  punthanesthai).  Just  as  in  verse 
15  except  that  here  mellon  refers  to  Lysias  instead  of  to  the 
conspirators  as  in  verse  15.  The  singular  is  used  by  the 
youth  out  of  deference  to  the  authority  of  Lysias  and  so 
modifies  a  bit  the  scheming  of  the  conspirators,  not  "absurd" 
as  Page  holds. 

21.  Do  not  therefore  yield  unto  them  (Su  oun  me  peistheis 
autois).  First  aorist  passive  subjunctive  of  peitho,  common 
verb,  here  to  be  persuaded  by,  to  listen  to,  to  obey,  to  yield 
to.  With  negative  and  rightly.  Do  not  yield  to  them  (da- 
tive) at  all.  On  the  aorist  subjunctive  with  me  in  prohibi- 
tions against  committing  an  act  see  Robertson,  Grammary 
pp.  851-4.  For  there  lie  in  wait  {enedreuousin  gar).  Present 
active  indicative  of  enedreuo,  old  verb  from  enedra  (verse 
16),  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  11:54  which  see.  Till 
they  have  slain  him  (heos  hou  anelosin  auton).  Same  idiom 
as  in  verse  12  save  that  here  we  have  anelosin  (second  aorist 
active  subjunctive)  instead  of  apokteinosin  (another  word 
for  kill),  "till  they  slay  him."  Looking  for  the  promise  from 
thee  (prosdechomenoi  ten  apo  sou  epaggelian).  This  item  is  all 
that  is  needed  to  put  the  scheme  through,  the  young  man 
shrewdly  adds. 

22.  Tell  no  man  (medeni  eklalesai).  Indirect  command 
{oratio  obliqua)  after  paraggeilas  (charging)  with  first  aorist 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  407 

active  infinitive  of  eklaleo  (in  ancient  Greek,  but  here  only 
in  N.T.),  but  construction  changed  to  direct  in  rest  of  the 
sentence  {oratio  recta)  as  in  1:4,  "that  thou  hast  signified 
these  things  to  me"  {hoti  tauta  enephanisas  pros  erne).  Same 
verb  here  as  in  verse  15.  This  change  is  common  in  the  N.T. 
(Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1047). 

23.  Two  {tinas  duo).  "Some  two"  as  in  Luke  7:19,  in- 
dicating (Page)  that  they  were  not  specially  chosen.  Soldiers 
(stratiotas),  horsemen  (hippeis),  spearmen  (dexiolabous). 
The  three  varieties  of  troops  in  a  Roman  army  like  the  cohort 
of  Lysias  (Page).  The  stratiotai  were  the  heavy-armed 
legionaries,  the  hippeis  belonged  to  every  legion,  the  dexio- 
laboi  were  light-armed  supplementary  troops  who  carried 
a  lance  in  the  right  hand  {dexios,  right,  lambano,  to  take). 
Vulgate,  lancearios.  At  the  third  hour  of  the  night  {apo  trites 
horas  tes  nuktos).  About  nine  in  the  evening. 

24.  Provide  beasts  {ktene  parastesai).  Change  from  direct 
to  indirect  discourse  just  the  opposite  of  that  in  verse  22. 
Beasts  (ktene).  For  riding  as  here  or  for  baggage.  See  on 
Luke  10:34.  Asses  or  horses,  but  not  war-horses.  Since  Paul 
was  chained  to  a  soldier,  another  animal  would  be  required 
for  baggage.  It  was  also  seventy  miles  and  a  change  of 
horses  might  be  needed.  The  extreme  precaution  of  Lysias 
is  explained  in  some  Latin  MSS.  as  due  to  fear  of  a  night 
attack  with  the  result  that  he  might  be  accused  to  Felix  of 
bribery.  Luke  also  probably  accompanied  Paul.  To  bring 
safe  (hina  diasososin).  Final  clause  with  hina  and  the 
first  aorist  active  subjunctive  of  diasozo,  old  verb,  to  save 
through  (dia)  to  a  finish.  Eight  times  in  the  N.T.  (Matt. 
14:36;  Luke  7:3;  Acts  23:24;  27:43,  44;  28:1,  4;  I  Peter  3:20). 
Unto  Felix  the  governor  (pros  Phelika  ton  hegemona).  Felix 
was  a  brother  of  Pallas,  the  notorious  favourite  of  Claudius. 
Both  had  been  slaves  and  were  now  freedmen.  Felix  was 
made  procurator  of  Judea  by  Claudius  a.d.  52.  He  held 
the  position  till  Festus  succeeded  him  after  complaints  by 


4o8      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

the  Jews  to  Nero.  He  married  Drusilla  the  daughter  of 
Herod  Agrippa  I  with  the  hope  of  winning  the  favour  of  the 
Jews.  He  was  one  of  the  most  depraved  men  of  his  time. 
Tacitus  says  of  him  that  ^'with  all  cruelty  and  lust  he 
exercised  the  power  of  a  king  with  the  spirit  of  a  slave."  The 
term  "governor"  {hegemon)  means  "leader"  from  hegeomai, 
to  lead,  and  was  applied  to  leaders  of  all  sorts  (emperors, 
kings,  procurators).  In  the  N.T.  it  is  used  of  Pilate  (Matt. 
27:2),  of  Felix,  (Acts  23:24,  26,  33;  24:1),  of  Festus  (26:30). 

25.  And  he  wrote  (grapsas).  First  aorist  active  participle 
of  graphd,  agreeing  with  the  subject  (Lysias)  of  eipen  (said) 
back  in  verse  23  (beginning).  After  this  form  [echousan  ton 
tupon  touton).  Textus  Receptus  has  periechousan.  The  use 
of  tupon  (type  or  form)  like  exemplum  in  Latin  (Page  who 
quotes  Cicero  Ad  Att.  IX.  6.  3)  may  give  merely  the  purport 
or  substantial  contents  of  the  letter.  But  there  is  no  reason 
for  thinking  that  it  is  not  a  genuine  copy  since  the  letter 
may  have  been  read  in  open  court  before  Felix,  and  Luke 
was  probably  with  Paul.  The  Roman  law  required  that  a 
subordinate  officer  like  Lysias  in  reporting  a  case  to  his 
superior  should  send  a  written  statement  of  the  case  and  it 
was  tenried  elogium.  A  copy  of  the  letter  may  have  been 
given  Paul  after  his  appeal  to  Caesar.  It  was  probably 
written  in  Latin.  The  letter  is  a  "dexterous  mixture  of 
truth  and  falsehood"  (Furneaux)  with  the  stamp  of  genuine- 
ness. It  puts  things  in  a  favourable  light  for  Lysias  and  makes 
no  mention  of  his  order  to  scourge  Paul. 

26.  Most  excellent  (kratistdi).  See  on  Luke  i  :3  to  Theophi- 
lus  though  not  in  Acts  i  :i.  It  is  usual  in  addressing  men  of 
rank  as  here,  like  our  "Your  Excellency"  in  24:3  and  Paul 
uses  it  to  Festus  in  26:25.  Greeting  (chairein).  Absolute 
infinitive  with  independent  or  absolute  nominative  {Klaudios 
Lusias)  as  is  used  in  letters  (Acts  15:23;  James  1:1)  and  in 
countless  papyri  (Robertson,  Grammar ^  p.  1092). 

27.  Was  seized  {sullemphthenla) .    First  aorist  passive  par-

ticiple  of  sullamhano.  Rescued  him  having  learned  that  he  was  a 
Roman  {exeilamen  mathon  hoti  Romaics  estin).  Wendt, 
Zoeckler,  and  Furneaux  try  to  defend  this  record  of  two 
facts  by  Lysias  in  the  wrong  order  from  being  an  actual 
lie  as  Bengel  rightly  says.  Lysias  did  rescue  Paul  and  he 
did  learn  that  he  was  a  Roman,  but  in  this  order.  Fie  did  not 
first  learn  that  he  was  a  Roman  and  then  rescue  him  as  his 
letter  states.  The  use  of  the  aorist  participle  {mathon  from 
manthanb)  after  the  principal  verb-  exeilamen  (second  aorist 
middle  of  exaireo,  to  take  out  to  oneself,  to  rescue)  can  be 
either  simultaneous  action  or  antecedent.  There  is  in  Greek 
no  such  idiom  as  the  aorist  participle  of  subsequent  action 
(Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  11 12-14).  Lysias  simply  reversed 
the  order  of  the  facts  and  omitted  the  order  for  scourging 
Paul  to  put  himself  in  proper  light  with  Felix  his  superior 
officer  and  actually  poses  as  the  protector  of  a  fellow  Roman 
citizen. 

28.  To  know  {epignonai).  To  know  fully,  epi,  second  aorist 
active  infinitive.  They  accused  him  {enekaloun  autoi).  Imper- 
fect active  indicative,  were  accusing  him  (dative),  repeating 
their  charges. 

29.  Concerning  questions  of  their  law  {peri  zetemata  tou 
nomou  auton).  The  very  distinction  drawn  by  Gallio  in 
Corinth  (Acts  i8:i4f.).  On  the  word  see  on  15:2.  But  to  have 
nothing  laid  to  his  charge  worthy  of  death  or  of  bonds  {meden 
de  axion  thanatou  e  desmon  echonta  enklema).  Literally, 
"having  no  accusation  (or  crime)  worthy  of  death  or  of 
bonds."  This  phrase  here  only  in  the  N.T.  Egklema  is  old 
word  for  accusation  or  crime  from  egkaleo  used  in  verse  28 
and  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  25:16.  Lysias  thus  expresses 
the  opinion  that  Paul  ought  to  be  set  free  and  the  lenient 
treatment  that  Paul  received  in  Caesarea  and  Rome  (first 
imprisonment)  is  probably  due  to  this  report  of  Lysias. 
Every  Roman  magistrate  before  whom  Paul  appears  de- 
clares him  innocent  (Gallio,  Lysias,  Felix,  Festus).

30.  When  it  was  shown  to  me  that  there  would  be  a  plot 
(menutheises  moi  epiboules  esesthai).  Two  constructions  com- 
bined; genitive  absolute  (menutheises  epiboules,  first  aorist 
passive  participle  of  menuo)  and  future  infinitive  {esesthai 
as  if  epiboulen  accusative  of  general  reference  used)  in  in- 
direct assertion  after  menuo  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  877). 
Charging  his  accusers  also  (paraggeilas  kai  tois  kategorois). 
First  aorist  active  participle  of  paraggello  with  which  com- 
pare mathon  above  (verse  27),  not  subsequent  action.  Da- 
tive case  in  kategorois.  Before  thee  {epi  sou).  Common  idiom 
for  "in  the  presence  of"  when  before  a  judge  (like  Latin 
apud)  as  in  24:20,  21;  25:26;  26:2.  What  happened  to  the 
forty  conspirators  we  have  no  way  of  knowing.  Neither  they 
nor  the  Jews  from  Asia  are  heard  of  more  during  the  long 
five  years  of  Paul's  imprisonment  in  Caesarea  and  Rome. 

31.  -^j  it  was  commanded  them  {kata  to  diatetagmenon 
autois).  "According  to  that  which  was  commanded  them," 
perfect  passive  articular  participle  of  diatasso.  By  night  {dia 
nuktos).  Through  the  night,  travelling  by  night  forty  miles 
from  Jerusalem  to  Antipatris  which  was  founded  by  Herod 
the  Great  and  was  on  the  road  from  Jerusalem  to  Caesarea, 
a  hard  night's  ride. 

33.  And  they  {hoitines).  Which  very  ones,  the  cavalry,  the 
horsemen  of  verse  31.  Delivered  (anadontes).  Second  aorist 
active  participle  of  anadidomi,  old  verb  to  give  up,  to  hand 
over,  here  only  in  the  N.T.  Presented  Paul  also  (parestesan 
kai  ton  Paulon).  First  aorist  active  (transitive,  not  second 
aorist  intransitive)  indicative  of  paristemi,  common  verb  to 
present  or  place  beside.  What  would  Paul's  friends  in 
Caesarea  (Philip  and  his  daughters)  think  of  the  prophecy 
of  Agabus  now  so  quickly  come  true. 

34.  When  he  had  read  it  (anagnous).  Second  aorist  active 
participle  of  anaginosko,  to  know  again,  to  read.  Of  what 
province  he  was  {ek  poias  eparcheias  estin).  Tense  of  estin  (is) 
retained  in  indirect  question.    Poias  is  strictly  "of  what 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  41 1 

kind  of"  province,  whether  senatorial  or  imperial.  Cilicia, 
like  Judea,  was  under  the  control  of  the  propraetor  of  Syria 
(imperial  province).  Paul's  arrest  was  in  Jerusalem  and  so 
under  the  jurisdiction  of  Felix  unless  it  was  a  matter  of  in- 
surrection when  he  could  appeal  to  the  propraetor  of  Syria. 
35.  /  will  hear  thy  cause  (diakousomai).  "I  will  hear  thee 
fully"  (^zfl).  When — are  come  {par agenontai).  Second  aorist 
middle  subjunctive  of  paraginomai  with  temporal  conjunc- 
tion hotan,  indefinite  temporal  clause  of  future  time  (Robert- 
son, Grammar,  p.  972),  "whenever  thine  accusers  come." 
In  Herod's  palace  {en  toi  praitorioi).  The  Latin  word  praeto- 
rium.  The  word  meant  the  camp  of  the  general,  then  the  pal- 
ace of  the  governor  as  here  and  Matt.  27:27  which  see,  and 
then  the  camp  of  praetorian  soldiers  or  rather  the  praetorian 
guard  as  in  Phil.  1:13. 


CHAPTER  XXIV 

1.  And  with  an  Orator^  one  Tertullus  {kai  rhetoros  Tertullou 
tinos).  A  deputation  of  elders  along  with  the  high  priest 
Ananias,  not  the  whole  Sanhedrin,  but  no  hint  of  the  forty 
conspirators  or  of  the  Asian  Jews.  The  Sanhedrin  had  be- 
come divided  so  that  now  it  is  probably  Ananias  (mortally 
oflFended)  and  the  Sadducees  who  take  the  lead  in  the  prose- 
cution of  Paul.  It  is  not  clear  whether  after  five  days  is  from 
Paul's  departure  from  Jerusalem  or  his  arrival  in  Caesarea. 
If  he  spent  nine  days  in  Jerusalem,  then  the  five  days  would 
be  counted  from  then  (verse  ii).  The  employment  of  a 
Roman  lawyer  (Latin  orator)  was  necessary  since  the  Jews 
were  not  familiar  with  Roman  legal  procedure  and  it  was  the 
custom  in  the  provinces  (Cicero  pro  Gael.  30).  The  speech 
was  probably  in  Latin  which  Paul  may  have  understood  also. 
Rhetor  is  a  common  old  Greek  word  meaning  a  forensic 
orator  or  advocate  but  here  only  in  the  N.T.  The  Latin 
rhetor  was  a  teacher  of  rhetoric,  a  very  different  thing. 
Tertullus  is  a  diminutive  of  Tertius  (Rom.  16:22).  Informed 
{enephanisan).  Same  verb  as  in  23:15,  22,  somewhat  like 
our  modern  "indictment,"  certainly  accusations  "against 
Paul"  {kata  tou  Paulou).  They  were  down  on  Paul  and  the 
hired  barrister  was  prosecuting  attorney.  For  the  legal  form 
see  Oxyrhynchus  Papyri,  Vol.  II.,  p.  162,  line  19. 

2.  fVhen  he  {Paul)  was  called  {klethentos  autou).  Genitive 
absolute  (as  so  often  in  Acts)  with  first  aorist  passive  parti- 
ciple of  kaleo.  Seeing  that  by  thee  we  enjoy  much  peace  {polles 
eirenes  tugchanontes  dia  sou).  Literally,  obtaining  much 
peace  by  thee.  A  regular  piece  of  flattery,  captatio  benevol- 
entiae,  to  ingratiate  himself  into  the  good  graces  of  the  gover- 
nor.   Felix  had  suppressed  a  riot,  but  Tacitus  {Ann.  XII.  54) 

412 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  413 

declares  that  Felix  secretly  encouraged  banditti  and  shared 
the  plunder  for  which  the  Jews  finally  made  complaint  to 
Nero  who  recalled  him.  But  it  sounded  well  to  praise  Felix 
for  keeping  peace  in  his  province,  especially  as  Tertullus 
was  going  to  accuse  Paul  of  being  a  disturber  of  the  peace. 
And  that  by  thy  providence  {kai  dia  tes  pronoias).  Forethought, 
old  Greek  word  from  pronoos  (pronoeo  in  I  Tim.  5:8;  Rom. 
12:17;  II  Cor.  8:21),  in  N.T.  only  here  and  Rom.  13:14. 
"Providence"  is  Latin  Providentia  (foreseeing,  provided). 
Roman  coins  often  have  Providentia  Caesaris.  Post-Augustan 
Latin  uses  it  of  God  (Deus).  Evils  are  corrected  for  this 
nation  (diorthomaton  ginomenon  toi  ethnei  toutoi).  Genitive 
absolute  again,  ginomenon,  present  middle  participle  de- 
scribing the  process  of  reform  going  on  for  this  nation  (dative 
case  of  personal  interest).  Diorthoma  (from  diorthoo,  to  set 
right)  occurs  from  Aristotle  on  of  setting  right  broken  limbs 
(Hippocrates)  or  reforms  in  law  and  life  (Polybius,  Plutarch). 
"Reform  continually  taking  place  for  this  nation."  Felix 
the  Reform  Governor  of  Judea !  It  is  like  a  campaign  speech, 
but  it  doubtless  pleased  Felix. 

3.  In  all  ways  and  in  all  places  {pantei  te  kai  pantachou). 
Pantei,  old  adverb  of  manner  only  here  in  N.T.  Pantachou 
also  old  adverb  of  place,  several  times  in  N.T.  But  these 
adverbs  most  likely  go  with  the  preceding  clause  about 
"reforms"  rather  than  as  here  translated  with  "we  accept" 
{apodechometha).  But  "with  all  gratitude"  {meta  pases 
eucharisiias)  does  naturally  go  with  apodechometha. 

4.  That  I  be  not  further  tedious  unto  thee  (hina  me  epi  pleion 
se  enkopto).  Koine  verb  (Hippocrates,  Polybius)  to  cut  in  on 
(or  Into),  to  cut  off,  to  impede,  to  hinder.  Our  modern 
telephone  and  radio  illustrate  it  well.  In  the  N.T.  (Acts 
24:4;IThess.  2:i8;Gal.  5:7;  Rom.  15:22;  I  Peter  3:7).  "That 
I  may  not  cut  in  on  or  interrupt  thee  further  {epi  pleion)  in 
thy  reforms."  Flattery  still.  Of  thy  clemency  (tei  sei  epiei- 
keidi).   Instrumental  case  of  old  word  from  epieikes  and  this 


414     WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

from  epi  and  eikos  (reasonable,  likely,  fair).  "Sweet  Reason- 
ableness" (Matthew  Arnold),  gentleness,  fairness.  An 
epieikes  man  is  "one  who  makes  reasonable  concessions" 
(Aristotle,  Eth.  V.  lo),  while  dikaios  is  "one  who  insists  on 
his  full  rights"  (Plato,  Leg.  757  D)  as  translated  by  Page. 
A  few  words  (suntomos).  Old  adverb  from  suntemno,  to  cut 
together  (short),  abbreviate.  Like  dia  bracheon  in  Heb. 
13:22.  In  N.T.  only  here  and  Mark  16  (shorter  conclusion). 
5.  For  we  have  found  {heurontes  gar).  Second  aorist  active 
participle  of  heurisko,  but  without  a  principal  verb  in  the 
sentence.  Probably  we  have  here  only  a  "summary  of  the 
charges  against  Paul"  (Page).  A  pestilent  fellow  (loimon). 
An  old  word  for  pest,  plague,  pestilence,  Paul  the  pest.  In 
N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  21  :ii  {loimoi  kai  limoi,  pestilences 
and  famines)  which  see.  Latin  pestis.  Think  of  the  greatest 
preacher  of  the  ages  being  branded  a  pest  by  a  contemporary 
hired  lawyer.  A  mover  of  insurrections  {kinounta  staseis). 
This  was  an  offence  against  Roman  law  if  it  could  be  proven. 
"Plotted  against  at  Damascus,  plotted  against  at  Jerusalem, 
expelled  from  Pisidian  Antioch,  stoned  at  Lystra,  scourged 
and  imprisoned  at  Philippi,  accused  of  treason  at  Thessa- 
lonica,  haled  before  the  proconsul  at  Corinth,  cause  of  a 
serious  riot  at  Ephesus,  and  now  finally  of  a  riot  at  Jeru- 
salem" (Furneaux).  Specious  proof  could  have  been  pro- 
duced, but  was  not.  Tertullus  went  on  to  other  charges  with 
which  a  Roman  court  had  no  concern  (instance  Gallio  in 
Corinth).  Throughout  the  world  {kata  ten  oikoumenen).  The 
Roman  inhabited  earth  [gen)  as  in  17:6.  A  ringleader  of  the 
sect  of  the  Nazarenes  (protostaten  tes  ton  Nazoraion  haireseos). 
Prbtostates  is  an  old  word  in  common  use  from  protos  and 
kistemi,  a  front-rank  man,  a  chief,  a  champion.  Here  only 
in  the  N.T.  This  charge  is  certainly  true.  About  "sect" 
(hairesis)  see  on  5:17.  Nazoraioi  here  only  in  the  plural  in 
the  N.T.,  elsewhere  of  Jesus  (Matt.  2 123 ;  26 71 ;  Luke  1 8 :37; 
John  18:5,  7;  19:19;  Acts  2:22;  3:6;  4:10;  6:14;  22:8;  26:9). 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  415 

The  disciple  is  not  above  his  Master.    There  was  a  sneer 
in  the  term  as  applied  to  Jesus  and  here  to  his  followers. 

6.  Assayed  to  profane  {epeirasen  bebelosai).  A  flat  untruth, 
but  the  charge  of  the  Asian  Jews  (21 :28-3o).  Verhum  optum 
ad  calumnian  (Bengel).  We  seized  (ekratesamen).  As  if  the 
Sanhedrin  had  arrested  Paul,  TertuUus  identifying  himself 
with  his  clients.  But  it  was  the  mob  (21 128-3 1)  that  attacked 
Paul  and  Lysias  who  rescued  him  (2i:32fl^.). 

7.  This  whole  verse  with  some  words  at  the  end  of  verse  6 
and  the  beginnihg  of  verse  8  in  the  Textus  Receptus  ("And 
would  have  judged  according  to  our  law.  But  the  chief 
captain  Lysias  came  upon  us,  and  with  great  violence  took 
him  away  out  of  our  hands,  commanding  his  accusers  to 
come  unto  thee")  is  absent  from  Aleph  A  B  H  L  P  61  (many 
other  cursives)  Sahidic  Bohairic.  It  is  beyond  doubt  a  later 
addition  to  the  incomplete  report  of  the  speech  of  Tertullus. 
As  the  Revised  Version  stands,  verse  8  connects  with  verse 
6.  The  motive  of  the  added  words  is  clearly  to  prejudice 
Felix  against  Lysias  and  they  contradict  the  record  in  Acts 
21.  Furneaux  holds  them  to  be  genuine  and  omitted  because 
contradictory  to  Acts  21.  More  likely  they  are  a  clumsy 
attempt  to  complete  the  speech  of  Tertullus. 

8.  From  whom  (par*  hou).  Referring  to  Paul,  but  in  the 
Textus  Receptus  referring  to  Lysias.  By  examining  him  thy- 
self (autos  anakrinas).  Not  by  torture,  since  Paul  was  a 
Roman  citizen,  but  by  hearing  what  Paul  has  to  say  in  de- 
fence of  himself.  Anakrino  is  to  examine  thoroughly  up  and 
down  as  in  Luke  23:14. 

9.  Joined  in  the  charge  (sunepethento) .  Second  aorist  mid- 
dle indicative  of  sunepiiithemi,  old  verb,  double  compound, 
to  place  upon  (epi)  together  with  (sun),  to  make  a  joint 
attack,  here  only  in  the  N.T.  Affirming  (phaskontes).  Alleg- 
ing, with  the  accusative  in  indirect  assertion  as  in  25:19; 
Rom.  1 :22  (nominative  with  infinitive,  Robertson,  Grammar, 
p.  1038).  Were  so  (houtos  echein),  "held  thus,"  common  idiom. 


4l6      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

10.  fFhen  the  governor  had  beckoned  to  him  {neusantos 
autoi  tou  hegemonos).  Genitive  absolute  again  with  first 
aorist  active  participle  of  neud^  to  give  a  nod,  old  word,  in 
N.T.  only  here  and  John  13:24.  "The  governor  nodding  to 
him."  Forasmuch  as  I  know  (epistamenos).  Knowing,  from 
epistamai.  That  thou  hast  been  of  many  years  a  judge  {ek 
pollon  eton  onta  se  kriten).  The  participle  in  indirect  assertion 
after  epistamenos  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1041).  Paul 
goes  as  far  as  he  can  in  the  way  of  a  compliment.  For  seven 
years  Felix  has  been  governor,  onta  being  a  sort  of  progressive 
present  participle  with  ek  pollon  eton  (Robertson,  Grammar^ 
p.  892).  Cheerfully  (euthumos).  Old  adverb  from  euthumos 
(eu  and  thumos,  good  spirit),  here  only  in  N.T.  Make  my 
defence  (apologoumai).  Old  and  regular  word  for  this  idea 
as  in  Luke  21:14  which  see. 

11.  Seeing  that  thou  canst  take  knowledge  (dunamenou  sou 
epignonai).  Genitive  absolute  again.  The  same  word  and 
form  (epignonai)  used  by  Tertullus,  if  in  Greek,  in  verse  8 
to  Felix.  Paul  takes  it  up  and  repeats  it.  Not  more  than 
twelve  days  (ou  pleious  hemerai  dodeka).  Here  e  (than)  is 
absent  without  change  of  case  to  the  ablative  as  usually 
happens.  But  this  idiom  is  found  in  the  KoinS  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  p.  666).  Since  (aph*  hes).  Supply  hemeras,  "from 
which  day."  To  worship  (proskuneson).  One  of  the  few 
examples  of  the  future  participle  of  purpose  so  common  in 
the  old  Attic. 

12.  Disputing  (dialegomenon).  Simply  conversing,  dis- 
cussing, arguing,  and  then  disputing,  common  verb  in  old 
Greek  and  in  N.T.  (especially  in  Acts).  Stirring  up  a  crowd 
(epistasin  poiounta  ochlou).  Epistasis  is  a  late  word  from 
ephistemi,  to  make  an  onset  or  rush.  Only  twice  in  the  N.T., 
II  Cor.  II  :28  (the  pressure  or  care  of  the  churches)  and  here 
(making  a  rush  of  a  crowd).  The  papyri  give  examples  also 
for  "onset."  So  Paul  denies  the  two  charges  that  were  serious 
and  the  only  one  that  concerned  Roman  law  (insurrection). 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  417 

13.  Prove  {parastesai).  First  aorist  active  infinitive  of 
parisUmij  to  place  beside.  They  have  made  "charges,"  mere 
assertions.  They  have  not  backed  up  these  charges  with 
proof,  "nor  can  they,"  says  Paul.  Now  (nuni).  As  if  they 
had  changed  their  charges  from  the  cries  of  the  mob  in 
Jerusalem  which  is  true.  Paul  has  no  hired  lawyer  to  plead 
for  him,  but  he  has  made  a  masterly  plea  for  his  freedom. 

14.  /  confess  {homologo) .  The  only  charge  left  was  that 
of  being  a  ringleader  of  the  sect  of  the  Nazarenes.  This 
Paul  frankly  confesses  is  true.  He  uses  the  word  in  its 
full  sense.  He  is  "guilty"  of  that.  After  the  Way  {kata  ten  ho- 
don).  This  word  Paul  had  already  applied  to  Christianity 
(22:4).  He  prefers  it  to  "sect"  [hairesin  which  means  a 
choosing,  then  a  division).  Paul  claims  Christianity  to  be 
the  real  (whole,  catholic)  Judaism,  not  a  "sect"  of  it.  But 
he  will  show  that  Christianity  is  not  a  deviation  from  Juda- 
ism, but  the  fulfilment  of  it  (Page)  as  he  has  already  shown 
in  Gal.  3  and  Rom.  9.  So  serve  I  the  God  of  our  fathers  (houtos 
latreuo  toi  patroioi  theot).  Paul  has  not  stretched  the  truth 
at  all.  He  has  confirmed  the  claim  made  before  the  Sanhedrin 
that  he  is  a  spiritual  Pharisee  in  the  truest  sense  (23:6). 
He  reasserts  his  faith  in  all  the  law  and  the  prophets,  holding 
to  the  Messianic  hope.  A  curious  "heretic"  surely!  Which 
these  themselves  also  look  for  {hen  kai  autoi  houtoi  prosdechon- 
tat).  Probably  with  a  gesture  towards  his  accusers.  He  does 
not  treat  them  all  as  Sadducees.  See  Titus  2:13  for  similar 
use  of  the  verb  {prosdechomenoi  ten  makarian  elpida,  looking 
for  the  happy  hope). 

15.  That  there  shall  be  a  resurrection  {anastasin  mellein 
esesthai).  Indirect  assertion  with  infinitive  and  accusative  of 
general  reference  {anastasin)  after  the  word  elpida  (hope). 
The  future  infinitive  esesthai  after  mellein  is  also  according  to 
rule,  mello  being  followed  by  either  present,  aorist,  or  future 
infinitive  (Robertson,  Grammar^  pp.  870,  877,  878).  Both  of 
the  just  and  the  unjust  {dikaion  te  kai  adikon).    Apparently 


4l8      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

at  the  same  time  as  in  John  5:29  (cf.  Acts  17:3  if.).  Gardner 
thinks  that  Luke  here  misrepresents  Paul  who  held  to  no 
resurrection  save  for  those  "in  Christ,"  a  mistaken  inter- 
pretation of  Paul  in  my  opinion.  The  Talmud  teaches  the 
resurrection  of  Israelites  only,  but  Paul  was  more  than  a 
Pharisee. 

16.  Herein  {en  toutoi).  His  whole  confession  of  belief  in 
verses  14  and  15.  Do  I  also  exercise  myself  {kai  autos  asko). 
"Do  I  also  myself  take  exercise,"  take  pains,  labour,  strive. 
Old  word  in  Homer  to  work  as  raw  materials,  to  adorn  by 
art,  then  to  drill.  Our  word  ascetic  comes  from  this  root, 
one  who  seeks  to  gain  piety  by  rules  and  severe  hardship. 
Paul  claims  to  be  equal  to  his  accusers  in  efforts  to  please 
God.  Void  of  offence  (aproskopon).  This  word  belongs  to  the 
papyri  and  N.T.  (only  in  Paul),  not  in  the  ancient  writers. 
The  papyri  examples  (Moulton  Milligan,  Vocabulary)  use 
the  word  to  mean  "free  from  hurt  or  harm."  It  is  a  privative 
and  proskopto  (to  cut  or  stumble  against).  Page  likes  "void 
of  oifence"  since  that  can  be  either  active  "not  stumbling" 
as  in  Phil.  1:10  or  passive  "not  stumbled  against"  as  in  I 
Cor.  10:32  (the  first  toward  God  and  the  second  toward 
men),  the  only  other  N.T.  examples.  Hence  the  word  here 
appears  in  both  senses  (the  first  towards  God,  the  second 
towards  men).  Paul  adds  "alway"  {dia  pantos),  a  bold  claim 
for  a  consistent  aim  in  life.  "Certainly  his  conscience  ac- 
quitted him  of  having  caused  any  offence  to  his  country- 
men" (Rackham).  Furneaux  thinks  that  it  must  have  been 
wormwood  and  gall  to  Ananias  to  hear  Paul  repeat  here  the 
same  words  because  of  which  he  had  ordered  Paul  to  be 
smitten  on  the  mouth  (23:if.). 

17.  j^fter  many  years  {di^  eton  pleionon).  "At  an  interval 
(dia)  of  more  (pleionon)  years"  (than  a  few,  one  must  add), 
not  "after  many  years."  If,  as  is  likely  Paul  went  up  to 
Jerusalem  in  Acts  18:22,  that  was  some  five  years  ago  and 
would  justify  "pleionon"  (several  years  ago  or  some  years 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  419 

ago).  To  bring  alms  {eleemosunas  poieson).  Another  (see 
proskuneson  in  verse  11)  example  of  the  future  participle 
of  purpose  in  the  N.T.  These  "alms"  (on  eleemosunas  see 
on  Matt.  6:1,  4  and  Acts  10:2,  common  in  Tobit  and  is  in 
the  papyri)  were  for  the  poor  saints  in  Jerusalem  (I  Cor. 
16:1-4;  II  Cor.  8  and  9;  Rom.  15:26)  who  were  none  the 
less  Jews.  "And  offerings"  {kai  prosphoras).  The  very- 
word  used  in  21:26  of  the  offerings  or  sacrifices  made  by 
Paul  for  the  four  brethren  and  himself.  It  does  not  follow 
that  it  was  Paul's  original  purpose  to  make  these  "offerings" 
before  he  came  to  Jerusalem  (cf.  18:18).  He  came  up  to 
worship  (verse  11)  and  to  be  present  at  Pentecost  (20:16). 

18.  Amidst  which  {en  hais).  That  is,  "in  which  offerings" 
(in  presenting  which  offerings,  21:27).  They  found  me  (my 
accusers  here  present,  heuron  me),  purified  in  the  temple 
{hegnismenon  en  tbi  hieroi).  Perfect  passive  participle  of 
hagnizo  (same  verb  in  21 :24,  26)  state  of  completion  of  the 
Jewish  sacrifices  which  had  gone  on  for  seven  days  (21:27), 
the  very  opposite  of  the  charges  made.  With  no  crowd  (ou 
meta  ochlou).  "Not  with  a  crowd"  till  the  Asiatic  Jews 
gathered  one  (21:27).  -^^r  yet  with  tumult  {oude  meta  thoru- 
bou).  They  made  the  tumult  (27:30),  not  Paul.  Till  they 
made  the  stir,  all  was  quiet. 

19.  But  certain  Jews  from  Asia  {tines  de  apo  tes  Asias 
loudaioi).  No  verb  appears  in  the  Greek  for  these  words. 
Perhaps  he  meant  to  say  that  "certain  Jews  from  Asia 
charged  me  with  doing  these  things."  Instead  of  saying 
that,  Paul  stops  to  explain  that  they  are  not  here,  a  thor- 
oughly Pauline  anacoluthon  (II  Cor.  7:5)  as  in  26:9.  "The 
passage  as  it  stands  is  instinct  with  life,  and  seems  to  exhibit 
the  abruptness  so  characteristic  of  the  Pauline  Epistles" 
(Page) .  Who  ought  to  have  been  here  before  thee  {hous  edei  epi 
sou  pareinai).  This  use  of  epi  with  genitive  of  the  person  is 
common.  The  imperfect  indicative  with  verbs  of  necessity 
and  obligation  to  express  failure  to  live  up  to  it  is  common

in  Greek  (Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  919-21).  "The  accusers 
who  were  present  had  not  witnessed  the  alleged  offence: 
those  who  could  have  given  evidence  at  first-hand  were 
not  present"  (Furneaux).  There  was  no  case  in  a  Roman 
court.  These  Asiatic  Jews  are  never  heard  of  after  the  riot, 
though  they  almost  succeeded  in  killing  Paul  then.  //  they 
had  aught  against  me  (ei  ti  echoien  pros  eme).  A  condition  of 
the  fourth  class  or  undetermined  with  less  likelihood  of  be- 
ing determined  {ei  with  the  optative,  Robertson,  Grammar, 
p.  I02i).  This  is  a  "mixed  condition"  {op.cit.,  p.  1022)  with 
a  conclusion  of  the  second  class. 

20.  These  men  themselves  {autoi  houtoi).  Since  the  Asiatic 
Jews  are  not  present  and  these  men  are.  Wrong  doing 
{adikema).  Or  misdeed.  Old  word  from  adiked,  to  do  wrong. 
In  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  18:14;  Rev.  18:5.  Paul  uses 
''adikema'^  from  the  standpoint  of  his  accusers.  "To  a  less 
sensitive  conscience  his  action  before  the  Sanhedrin  would 
have  seemed  venial  enough"  (Furneaux).  When  I  stood 
(stantos  mou).  Genitive  absolute,  second  aorist  active 
participle  of  histemi  (intransitive),  "when  I  took  my  stand." 
Before  the  council  {epi  tou  sunedriou).  Same  use  of  epi  with 
genitive  as  in  verse  19. 

21.  Except  it  he  (e).  Literally,  "than,"  but  after  inter- 
rogative ti  =  ti  alio  "what  else  than."  For  this  one  voice  {peri 
mias  tautes  phones).  The  normal  Greek  idiom  with  the 
attributive  use  of  houtos  calls  for  the  article  before  mias, 
though  some  inscriptions  show  it  as  here  (Robertson,  Gram- 
mar, p.  702).  That  {hes).  Genitive  of  the  relative  attracted 
to  the  case  of  the  antecedent  phones.  I  cried  {ekekraxa).  Re- 
duplicated aorist  as  is  usual  with  this  verb  in  the  LXX 
(Judges  3:15).  Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  348.  Touching  {peri). 
Concerning  (around,  about).  /  am  called  in  question  {krino- 
mai).  As  in  23:6.  Before  you  {eph'  humon).  Same  idiom  as 
in  verses  19  and  20. 

22.  Having    more    exact    knotvledge    {akribesteron    eidos). 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  421 

"Knowing"  (second  perfect  active  participle  of  oida)  "more 
accurately"  (comparative  of  adverb  akribos).  More  ac- 
curately than  what?  Than  the  Sanhedrin  supposed  he  had 
"concerning  the  Way"  {ta  peri  tes  hodou,  the  things  concern- 
ing the  Way,  common  in  Acts  for  Christianity).  How  Felix 
had  gained  this  knowledge  of  Christianity  is  not  stated. 
Philip  the  Evangelist  lived  here  in  Caesarea  and  there  was 
a  church  also.  Drusilla  was  a  Jewess  and  may  have  told  him 
something.  Besides,  it  is  wholly  possible  that  Felix  knew 
of  the  decision  of  Gallio  in  Corinth  that  Christianity  was  a 
religio  licita  as  a  form  of  Judaism.  As  a  Roman  official  he 
knew  perfectly  well  that  the  Sanhedrin  with  the  help  of 
Tertullus  had  failed  utterly  to  make  out  a  case  against 
Paul.  He  could  have  released  Paul  and  probably  would 
have  done  so  but  for  fear  of  offending  the  Jews  whose  ruler 
he  was  and  the  hope  that  Paul  (note  "alms"  in  verse  17) 
might  offer  him  bribes  for  his  liberty.  Deferred  them  (ane- 
baleto  autous).  Second  aorist  middle  indicative  of  anahallo, 
old  verb  (only  here  in  N.T.)  to  throw  or  toss  up,  to  put  back 
or  off,  in  middle  to  put  off  from  one,  to  delay,  to  adjourn. 
Felix  adjourned  the  case  without  a  decision  under  a  plausible 
pretext,  that  he  required  the  presence  of  Lysias  in  person, 
which  was  not  the  case.  Lysias  had  already  said  that  Paul 
was  innocent  and  was  never  summoned  to  Caesarea,  so  far 
as  we  know.  Since  Paul  was  a  Roman  citizen,  Lysias  could 
have  thrown  some  light  on  the  riot,  if  he  had  any.  Shall 
come  down  (kaiabei).  Second  aorist  active  subjunctive  of 
katabaino.  I  will  determine  your  matter  {diagnosomai  ta  kath* 
humds).  Future  middle  of  diaginosko,  old  and  common  verb 
to  know  accurately  or  thoroughly  (dia).  In  the  N.T.  only 
here  (legal  sense)  and  23:15.  "The  things  according  to  you" 
(plural,  the  matters  between  Paul  and  the  Sanhedrin). 

23.  ^nd  should  have  indulgence  {echein  te  anesin).  From 
aniemi,  to  let  loose,  release,  relax.  Old  word,  in  the  N.T.  only 
here  and  H  Thess.  1:7^  H  Cor.  2:13;  7:5;  8:13.    It  is  the

opposite  of  strict  confinement,  though  under  guard,  "kept 
in  charge"  {tereisthai) .  Forbid  {koluein).  To  hinder  "no 
one  of  his  friends"  {medena  ton  idion).  No  one  of  Paul's 
"own"  (cf.  4:23;  John  i  :ii)  or  intimates.  Of  these  we  know 
the  names  of  Luke,  Aristarchus,  Trophimus,  Philip  the 
Evangelist. 

24.  With  Drusilla  his  wife  {sun  Drousillei  tei  ididi  gunaiki). 
Felix  had  induced  her  to  leave  her  former  husband  Aziz, 
King  of  Emesa.  She  was  one  of  three  daughters  of  Herod 
Agrippa  I  (Drusilla,  Mariamne,  Bernice).  Her  father  mur- 
dered James,  her  great-uncle  Herod  Antipas  slew  John  the 
Baptist,  her  great-grandfather  (Herod  the  Great)  killed  the 
babes  of  Bethlehem.  Perhaps  the  mention  of  Drusilla  as 
"his  own  wife"  is  to  show  that  it  was  not  a  formal  trial  on 
this  occasion.  Page  thinks  that  she  was  responsible  for  the 
interview  because  of  her  curiosity  to  hear  Paul.  Sent  for 
(metepempsato).  First  aorist  middle  of  metapempd  as  usual 
(Acts    10:5). 

25.  Was  terrified  {emphobos  genomenos) .  Ingressive  aorist 
middle  of  ginomai,  "becoming  terrified."  Emphobos  {en  and 
phobos)  old  word,  in  the  N.T.  only  Luke  24:5;  Acts  10:5; 
24:25;  Rev.  11:13  .  Paul  turned  the  tables  completely 
around  and  expounded  "the  faith  in  Christ  Jesus"  as  it 
applied  to  Felix  and  Drusilla  and  discoursed  {dialegomenou 
autou,  genitive  absolute)  concerning  "righteousness"  {di- 
kaiosunes)  which  they  did  not  possess,  "self-control"  or 
temperance  {egkrateias)  which  they  did  not  exhibit,  and 
"the  judgment  to  come"  {tou  krimatos  ton  mellontos)  which 
was  certain  to  overtake  them.  Felix  was  brought  under  con- 
viction, but  apparently  not  Drusilla.  Like  another  Herodias 
her  resentment  was  to  be  feared  (Knowling).  Go  thy  way  for 
this  time  {to  nun  echon  poreuou).  The  ancient  Greek  has 
this  use  of  to  nun  echon  (Tobit  7:11)  in  the  accusative  of 
time,  "as  for  the  present  or  holding  the  now."  When  I  have 
a  convenient  season  {kairon  metalabon) .    Second  aorist  active

that  Paul  had  given. 

26.  He  hoped  withal  {hama  kai  elpizon).  "At  the  same 
time  also  hoping."  Paul  had  mentioned  the  "alms"  (24:17) 
and  that  excited  the  avarice  of  Felix  for  "money"  {chrematd). 
Roman  law  demanded  exile  and  confiscation  for  a  magistrate 
who  accepted  bribes,  but  it  was  lax  in  the  provinces.  Felix 
had  doubtless  received  them  before.  Josephus  {Ant.  XX. 
8,  9)  represents  Felix  as  greedy  for  money.  The  oftener

In  the  papyri,  in  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  28 :30.  Compound 
of  dia,  two  {duo,  dis)  and  etos,  year.  So  Paul  lingered  on  in 
prison  in  Caesarea,  waiting  for  the  second  hearing  under 
Felix  which  never  came.  Caesarea  now  became  the  compul- 
sory headquarters  of  Paul  for  two  years.  With  all  his  travels 
Paul  spent  several  years  each  at  Tarsus,  Antloch,  Corinth, 
Ephesus,  though  not  as  a  prisoner  unless  that  was  true 
part  of  the  time  at  Ephesus  for  which  there  is  some  evidence 
though  not  of  a  convincing  kind.  We  do  not  know  that  Luke 
remained  in  Caesarea  all  this  time.  In  all  probability  he 
came  and  went  with  frequent  visits  with  Philip  the  Evangel- 
ist.   It  was  probably  during  this  period  that  Luke  secured

the  material  for  his  Gospel  and  wrote  part  or  all  of  it  be- 
fore going  to  Rome.  He  had  ample  opportunity  to  examine 
the  eyewitnesses  who  heard  Jesus  and  the  first  attempts  at 
writing  including  the  Gospel  of  Mark  (Luke  1:1-4).  ^^^ 
succeeded  by  (elaben  diadochon).  Literally,  "received  as  suc- 
cessor." Diadochos  is  an  old  word  from  diadechomai,  to  re- 
ceive in  succession  (dia,  duo,  two)  and  occurs  here  alone  in 
the  N.T.  Deissmann  (Bible  Studies,  p.  115)  gives  papyri 
examples  where  hoi  diadochoi  means  "higher  officials  at  the 
court  of  the  Ptolemies,"  probably  "deputies,"  a  usage  grow- 
ing out  of  the  "successors"  of  Alexander  the  Great  (Moulton 
and  Milligan's  Vocabulary),  though  here  the  original  notion 
of  "successor"  occurs  (cf.  Josephus,  Ant.  XX.  8,  9).  Luke 
does  not  tell  why  Felix  "received"  a  successor.  The  explana- 
tion is  that  during  these  two  years  the  Jews  and  the  Gentiles 
had  an  open  fight  in  the  market-place  in  Caesarea.  Felix  put 
the  soldiers  on  the  mob  and  many  Jews  were  killed.  The 
Jews  made  formal  complaint  to  the  Emperor  with  the  re- 
sult that  Felix  was  recalled  and  Porcius  Festus  sent  in  his 
stead.  Porcius  Festus  (Porkion  Pheston).  We  know  very 
little  about  this  man.  He  is  usually  considered  a  worthier 
man  than  Felix,  but  Paul  fared  no  better  at  his  hands  and 
he  exhibits  the  same  insincerity  and  eagerness  to  please  the 
Jews.  Josephus  {Ant.  XX.  8,  9)  says  that  "Porcius  Festus 
was  sent  as  a  successor  to  Felix."  The  precise  year  when  this 
change  occurred  is  not  clear.  Albinus  succeeded  Festus  by 
A.D.  62,  so  that  it  is  probable  that  Festus  came  a.d.  58  (or 
59).  Death  cut  short  his  career  in  a  couple  of  years  though 
he  did  more  than  Felix  to  rid  the  country  of  robbers  and 
sicarii.  Some  scholars  argue  for  an  earlier  date  for  the  re- 
call of  Felix.  Nero  became  Emperor  Oct.  13,  a.d.  54.  Pop- 
paea,  his  Jewish  mistress  and  finally  wife,  may  have  had 
something  to  do  with  the  recall  of  Felix  at  the  request  of  the 
Jews.  Desiring  to  gain  favour  with  the  Jews  (thelon  te  charita 
katathesthai  tois  loudaiois).    Reason  for  his  conduct.    Note

second  aorist  (ingressive)  middle  infinitive  katathesthai  from 
katatithemij  old  verb  to  place  down,  to  make  a  deposit,  to 
deposit  a  favour  with,  to  do  something  to  win  favour.  Only 
here  and  25:9  in  N.T.,  though  in  some  MSB.  in  Mark  15:46. 
It  is  a  banking  figure.  Left  Paul  in  bonds  {katelipe  ton 
Paulon  dedemenon).  Effective  aorist  active  indicative  of 
kataleipo,  to  leave  behind.  Paul  "in  bonds"  {dedemenony 
perfect  passive  participle  of  deo,  to  bind)  was  the  "deposit" 
{katathesthai)  for  their  favour.  Codex  Bezae  adds  that  Felix 
left  Paul  in  custody  "because  of  Drusilla"  {dia  Drousillan). 
She  disliked  Paul  as  much  as  Herodias  did  John  the  Baptist. 
So  Pilate  surrendered  to  the  Jews  about  the  death  of  Jesus 
when  they  threatened  to  report  him  to  Caesar.  Some  critics 
would  date  the  third  group  of  Paul's  Epistles  (Philippians, 
Philemon,  Colossians,  Ephesians)  to  the  imprisonment  here 
in  Caesarea,  some  even  to  one  in  Ephesus.  But  the  arguments 
for  either  of  these  two  views  are  more  specious  than  convinc- 
ing. Furneaux  would  even  put  II  Tim.  4:9-22  here  in  spite 
of  the  flat  contradiction  with  Acts  21:29  about  Trophimus 
being  in  Jerusalem  instead  of  Miletus  (II  Tim.  4:20),  a  "mis- 
take" which  he  attributes  to  Luke!  That  sort  of  criticism 
can  prove  anything. 


CHAPTER  XXV 

1.  Having  come  into  the  province  {epibas  tei  eparcheidi). 
Second  aorist  active  participle  of  epibaino,  to  set  foot  upon. 
Literally,  "Having  set  foot  upon  his  province."  Eparcheia 
is  a  late  word  for  province,  in  N.T.  only  here  and  23:34. 
Judea  was  not  strictly  a  province,  but  a  department  (Page) 
of  the  province  of  Syria  which  was  under  a  propraetor  {lega- 
tus  Caesaris)  while  Judea  was  under  a  procurator  (epitropos). 
After  three  days  (meta  treis  hemeras).  So  in  Acts  28:17  in 
Rome.  That  is  on  the  third  day,  with  a  day  of  rest  in  be- 
tween. Precisely  the  language  used  of  the  resurrection  of 
Jesus  "after  three  days"  =  "on  the  third  day."  So  by 
common  usage  then  and  now. 

2.  The  principal  men  {hoi  prbtoi).  The  first  men,  the  lead- 
ing men  of  the  city,  besides  the  chief  priests.  In  verse  15  we 
have  "the  chief  priests  and  the  elders."  These  chief  men 
among  the  Jews  would  desire  to  pay  their  respects  to  the 
new  Procurator  on  his  first  visit  to  Jerusalem.  There  was 
another  high  priest  now,  Ishmael  in  place  of  Ananias.  In- 
formed him  against  Paul  (enephanisan  autoi  kata  tou  Paulou). 
"This  renewal  of  the  charge  after  two  years,  on  the  very 
first  opportunity,  is  a  measure,  not  only  of  their  unsleeping 
hatred,  but  of  the  importance  which  they  attached  to  Paul's 
influence"  (Furneaux).  Besought  (parekaloun).  Imperfect 
active,  kept  on  beseeching  as  a  special  favour  to  the  Jews. 

3.  Asking  favour  against  him  (aitoumenoi  charin  kat*  autou). 
A  favour  to  themselves  (middle  voice),  not  to  Paul,  but 
"against"  {kat\  down,  against)  him.  That  he  would  send  for 
(hopos  metapempsetai).  First  aorist  middle  subjunctive  of 
metapempo  (see  24:24,  26)  with  final  particle  hopos  like  hina. 
Aorist  tense  for  single  case.    Laying  wait  (enedran  poiountes).

THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  427 

See  on  23:16  for  the  word  enedra.  Old  idiom  (Thucydides) 
for  laying  a  plot  or  ambush  as  here.  Only  these  two  uses  of 
enedra  in  N.T.  Two  years  before  the  Sanhedrin  had  agreed 
to  the  plot  of  the  forty  conspirators.  Now  they  propose  one 
on  their  own  initiative.  On  the  way  (kata  ten  hodon).  Down 
along,  up  and  down  along  the  way.  Plenty  of  opportunity 
would  occur  between  Caesarea  and  Jerusalem  for  ambush 
and  surprise  attacks. 

4.  Howheit  {men  oun).  No  antithesis  expressed,  though 
Page  considers  de  in  verse  6  to  be  one.  They  probably 
argued  that  it  was  easier  for  one  man  (Paul)  to  come  to 
Jerusalem  than  for  many  to  go  down  there.  But  Festus  was 
clearly  suspicious  (verse  6)  and  was  wholly  within  his  rights 
to  insist  that  they  make  their  charges  in  Caesarea  where  he 
held  court.  fFas  kept  in  charge  (tereisthat) .  Present  passive 
infinitive  of  tereo  in  indirect  assertion.  Hoti  with  finite 
verb  is  more  common  after  apokrinomai^  but  the  infinitive 
with  the  accusative  of  general  reference  is  proper  as  here 
(Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1036).  Shortly  (en  tachei).  In 
quickness,  in  speed.  Old  and  common  usage,  seen  already 
in  Luke  18:8;  Acts  12:7;  22:18.  Festus  is  clearly  within  his 
rights  again  since  his  stay  in  Caesarea  had  been  so  brief. 
He  did  go  down  in  "eight  or  ten  days"  (verse  6).  Luke  did 
not  consider  the  matter  important  enough  to  be  precise. 

5.  Them  therefore  which  are  of  power  among  you  {hoi  oun  en 
humin  dunatoi).  "The  mighty  ones  among  you,"  "the  men 
of  power"  {dunatoi)  and  authority,  "the  first  men,"  the 
Sanhedrin,  in  other  words.  Note  change  here  by  Luke  from 
indirect  discourse  in  verse  4,  to  direct  in  verse  5  {phesin, 
says  he).  Go  down  with  me  {sunkatabantes).  Double  com- 
pound (sun,  kata)  second  aorist  active  participle  of  sunkata- 
baino.  It  was  a  fair  proposal.  //  there  is  anything  amiss  in  the 
man  {ei  ti  estin  en  toi  andri  atopon).  Condition  of  the  first 
class,  assuming  that  there  is  (to  be  courteous  to  them), 
but  not  committing  himself  on  the  merits  of  the  case.  Atopon 


428      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

is  an  old  word,  specially  common  in  Plato,  meaning  "out 
of  place."  In  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  23:41  which  see; 
Acts  28:6;  II  Thess.  3:2.  Note  present  tense  active  voice 
of  kategoreitbsan  (imperative)  of  kategoreb,  repeat  their 
accusations. 

6.  On  the  morrow  {tei  epaurion).  Locative  case  of  the 
article  with  hemerdi  understood  {epaurion^  adverb,  to- 
morrow). Festus  lost  no  time* for  the  chief  men  had  come 
down  with  him.  Sat  on  the  judgment  seat  (kathisas  epi  tou 
hematos).  A  legal  formality  to  give  weight  to  the  decision. 
Ingressive  aorist  active  participle.  For  this  use  of  hema  for 
judgment  seat  see  on  Matt.  27:19;  John  19:13;  Acts  12:21; 
18:12;  25:10,  17.  Same  phrase  repeated  in  25:17.  To  he 
brought  (achthenai).  First  aorist  passive  infinitive  of  ago 
after  ekeleusen  (commanded).  Same  words  repeated  in 
25:17  by  Festus. 

7.  When  he  was  come  (paragenomenou  autou).  Genitive 
absolute  of  common  verb  paraginomai  (cf.  24:24).  Which 
had  come  down  {hoi  katahehekotes).  Perfect  active  participle 
of  katahainb.  They  had  come  down  on  purpose  at  the  in- 
vitation of  Festus  (verse  5),  and  were  now  ready.  Stood 
round  about  him  {periestesan  auton).  Second  aorist  (ingres- 
sive) active  (intransitive)  of  periistemi,  old  verb,  "Took 
their  stand  around  him,"  ^^periculum  intentantes"  (Bengel). 
Cf.  Luke  23:10  about  Christ.  They  have  no  lawyer  this 
time,  but  they  mass  their  forces  so  as  to  impress  Festus. 
Bringing  against  him  (katapherontes).  Bearing  down  on. 
See  on  20:9  and  26:10,  only  N.T.  examples  of  this  ancient 
verb.  Many  and  grievous  charges  {polla  kai  barea  aitibmata). 
This  word  aitibma  for  old  form  aitiama  is  found  in  one 
papyrus  (Moulton  and  Milligan's  Vocabulary)  in  sense  of 
"blame."  But  the  charges  were  no  "heavier"  than  those 
made  by  Tertullus  (24:5-8).  Paul's  reply  proves  this  and 
they  were  also  probably  on  court  record  (Furneaux).  See 
this  adjective  harus   (heavy)   used  with  lukoi  (wolves)   in 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  429 

20:29.  Which  they  could  not  prove  (ha  ouk  ischuon  apodeixai). 
Imperfect  active  of  ischuOj  to  have  strength  or  power  as  in 
19:16,  20.  Repetition  and  reiteration  and  vehemence  took 
the  place  of  proof  {apodeixai^  first  aorist  active  infinitive  of 
apodeiknumi,  to  show  forth,  old  verb,  in  N.T.  only  here. 
Acts  2:22  which  see  and  I  Cor.  4:9). 

8.  While  Paul  said  in  his  defence  (tou  Paulou  apologou- 
menou).  Genitive  absolute  again,  present  middle  participle 
of  apologeomai,  old  verb  to  make-defence  as  in  19:33;  24:10; 
26:1,  2.  The  recitative  hoti  of  the  Greek  before  a  direct 
quotation  is  not  reproduced  in  English.  Have  I  sinned  at 
all  (ti  hemarton).  Constative  aorist  active  indicative  of 
hamartano,  to  miss,  to  sin.  The  ti  is  cognate  accusative  (or 
adverbial  accusative).  Either  makes  sense.  Paul  sums  up 
the  charges  under  the  three  items  of  law  of  the  Jews,  the 
temple,  the  Roman  state  (Caesar).  This  last  was  the  one  that 
would  interest  Festus  and,  if  proved,  would  render  Paul 
guilty  of  treason  (majestas).  Nero  was  Emperor  a.d.  54-68, 
the  last  of  the  emperors  with  any  hereditary  claim  to  the 
name  "Caesar."  Soon  it  became  merely  a  title  like  Kaiser 
and  Czar  (modern  derivatives).  In  Acts  only  "Caesar" 
and  "Augustus"  are  employed  for  the  Emperor,  not  "King" 
{Basileus)  as  from  the  time  of  Domitian.  Paul's  denial  is 
complete  and  no  proof  had  been  presented.  Luke  was  a|>- 
parently  present  at  the  trial. 

9.  Desiring  to  gain  favour  with  the  Jews  (thelon  tois  lou- 
daiois  charin  katathesthai).  Precisely  the  expression  used  of 
Felix  by  Luke  in  24:27  which  see.  Festus,  like  Felix,  falls  a 
victim  to  fear  of  the  Jews.  Before  me  {ep*  emov).  Same  use 
of  epi  with  the  genitive  as  in  23 :30;  24:19,  21.  Festus,  seeing 
that  it  was  unjust  to  condemn  Paul  and  yet  disadvantageous 
to  absolve  him  (Blass),  now  makes  the  very  proposal  to 
Paul  that  the  rulers  had  made  to  him  in  Jerusalem  (verse 
3).  He  added  the  words  "^/>'  emou*^  (before  me)  as  if  to  in- 
sure Paul  of  justice.    If  Festus  was  unwilling  to  give  Paul 


430     WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

justice  in  Caesarea  where  his  regular  court  held  forth,  what 
assurance  was  there  that  Festus  would  give  it  to  him  at 
Jerusalem  in  the  atmosphere  of  intense  hostility  to  Paul? 
Only  two  years  ago  the  mob,  the  Sanhedrin,  the  forty  con- 
spirators had  tried  to  take  his  life  in  Jerusalem.  Festus  had 
no  more  courage  to  do  right  than  Felix,  however  plausible 
his  language  might  sound.  Festus  also,  while  wanting  Paul 
to  think  that  he  would  in  Jerusalem  "be  judged  of  these 
things  before  me,"  in  reality  probably  intended  to  turn 
Paul  over  to  the  Sanhedrin  in  order  to  please  the  Jews, 
probably  with  Festus  present  also  to  see  that  Paul  received 
justice  (me  presente).  Festus  possibly  was  surprised  to  find 
that  the  charges  were  chiefly  against  Jewish  law,  though 
one  was  against  Caesar.  It  was  not  a  mere  change  of 
venue  that  Paul  sensed,  but  the  utter  unwillingness  of 
Festus  to  do  his  duty  by  him  and  his  willingness  to  con- 
nive at  Jewish  vengeance  on  Paul.  Paul  had  faced  the  mob 
and  the  Sanhedrin  in  Jerusalem,  two  years  of  trickery  at 
the  hands  of  Felix  in  Caesarea,  and  now  he  is  confronted 
by  the  bland  chicanery  of  Festus.  It  is  too  much,  the  last 
straw. 

lo.  /  am  standing  before  Caesar^ s  judgment-seat  (Hestos  epi 
tou  bematos  Kaisaros  eimi).  Periphrastic  present  perfect 
indicative  {hestos  eimi),  second  perfect  participle  hestos  of 
histemi  (intransitive).  Paul  means  to  say  that  he  is  a  Roman 
citizen  before  a  Roman  tribunal.  Festus  was  the  representa- 
tive of  Caesar  and  had  no  right  to  hand  him  over  to  a  Jewish 
tribunal.  Festus  recognized  this  by  saying  to  Paul  "wilt 
thou"  (theleis).  Where  I  ought  to  be  judged  {hou  me  dei 
krinesthai).  Rather,  "Where  I  must  be  judged,"  for  dei 
expresses  necessity  (it  is  necessary).  Paul  exposes  the  con- 
duct of  Festus  with  merciless  precision.  Js  thou  also  very 
well  knowest  {hos  kai  su  kallion  epiginbskeis).  "As  thou  also 
dost  understand  (hast  additional  knowledge,  epiginoskeis) 
better"   (than   thou   art  willing  to  admit).      That   this   is 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  431 

Paul's  meaning  by  the  use  of  the  comparative  kallion  (posi- 
tive kalos)  is  made  plain  by  the  confession  of  Festus  to 
Agrippa  in  verse  18.  Paul  says  that  Festus  knows  that  he 
has  done  no  wrong  to  the  Jews  at  all  {ouden  edikeka)  and 
yet  he  is  trying  to  turn  him  over  to  the  wrath  of  the  Jews  in 
Jerusalem. 

II.  //  /  am  a  wrong-doer  {ei  men  oun  adiko).  Condition  of 
the  first  class  with  ei  and  the  present  active  indicative  of 
adikeo  {a  privative  and  dike):  "If  I  am  in  the  habit  of  doing 
injustice,"  assuming  it  to  be  true  for  the  sake  of  argument. 
And  have  committed  anything  worthy  of  death  {kai  axion 
thanatou  pepracha).  Same  condition  with  the  difference  in 
tense  (pepracha,  perfect  active  indicative)  of  a  single  case 
instead  of  a  general  habit.  Assuming  either  or  both  Paul 
draws  his  conclusion.  /  refuse  not  to  die  {ou  paraitoumai  to 
apothanein).  Old  verb  to  ask  alongside,  to  beg  from,  to 
deprecate,  to  refuse,  to  decline.  See  on  Luke  I4:i8f.  Jose- 
phus  {Life,  29)  has  thanein  ou  paraitoumai.  Here  the  articular 
second  aorist  active  infinitive  is  in  the  accusative  case  the 
object  oi paraitoumai:  "I  do  not  beg  off  dying  from  myself." 
But  if  noni  of  these  things  is  {ei  de  ouden  estin).  De  here  is 
contrasted  with  men  just  before.  No  word  for  "true"  in 
the  Greek.  Estin  ("is")  in  the  Greek  here  means  "exists." 
Same  condition  (first  class,  assumed  as  true).  Whereof  these 
accuse  me  {hon  houtoi  kategorousin  mou).  Genitive  of  relative 
hon  by  attraction  from  ha  (accusative  with  kategorousin)  to 
case  of  the  unexpressed  antecedent  touton{"oi  these  things"). 
Mou  is  genitive  of  person  after  kategorousin.  No  man  can 
give  me  up  to  them  {oudeis  me  dunatai  autois  charisasthai). 
"Can"  legally.  Paul  is  a  Roman  citizen  and  not  even 
Festus  can  make  a  free  gift  {charisasthai)  of  Paul  to  the 
Sanhedrin.  /  appeal  unto  Caesar  {Kaisara  epikaloumai). 
Technical  phrase  like  Latin  Caesarem  appello.  Originally 
the  Roman  law  allowed  an  appeal  from  the  magistrate  to 
the  people  {provocatio  ad  populum),  but  the  emperor  repre- 


432      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

sented  the  people  and  so  the  appeal  to  Caesar  was  the  right 
of  every  Roman  citizen.  Paul  had  crossed  the  Rubicon  on 
this  point  and  so  took  his  case  out  of  the  hands  of  dilatory- 
provincial  justice  (really  injustice).  Roman  citizens  could 
make  this  appeal  In  capital  offences.  There  would  be  ex- 
pense connected  with  it,  but  better  that  with  some  hope  than 
delay  and  certain  death  in  Jerusalem.  Festus  was  no  better 
than  Felix  in  his  vacillation  and  desire  to  curry  favour  with 
the  Jews  at  Paul's  expense.  No  doubt  Paul's  long  desire  to 
see  Rome  (19:21;  Rom.  15:22-28)  and  the  promise  of  Jesus 
that  he  would  see  Rome  (Acts  23:11)  played  some  part  in 
Paul's  decision.  But  he  made  it  reluctantly  for  he  says  in 
Rome  (Acts  28:19):  "I  was  constrained  to  appeal."  But 
acquittal  at  the  hands  of  Festus  with  the  hope  of  going  to 
Rome  as  a  free  man  had  vanished. 

12.  When  he  had  conferred  with  the  council  {sunlalesas 
meta  tou  sumbouliou) .  The  word  sumboulion  in  the  N.T. 
usually  means  "counsel"  as  in  Matt.  12:14,  t>ut  here  alone 
as  an  assembly  of  counsellors  or  council.  But  the  papyri 
(Milligan  and  Moulton's  Vocabulary)  furnish  a  number  of 
instances  of  this  sense  of  the  word  as  "council."  Here  it 
apparently  means  the  chief  officers  and  personal  retinue  of 
the  procurator,  his  assessors  {assessores  consiliarii) .  These 
local  advisers  were  a  necessity.  Some  discretion  was  allowed 
the  governor  about  granting  the  appeal.  If  the  prisoner  were 
a  well-known  robber  or  pirate,  it  could  be  refused.  Thou  hast 
appealed  unto  Caesar  (Kaisara  epikeklesai).  The  same 
technical  word,  but  the  perfect  tense  of  the  indicative. 
Unto  Caesar  thou  shalt  go  {epi  Kaisara  poreusei).  Perhaps 
the  volitive  future  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  874).  Bengel 
thinks  that  Festus  sought  to  frighten  Paul  with  these  words. 
Knowling  suggests  that  "they  may  have  been  uttered,  if 
not  with  a  sneer,  yet  with  the  implication  'thou  little  knowest 
what  an  appeal  to  Caesar  means.'"  But  embarrassment 
will  come  to  Festus.   He  has  refused  to  acquit  this  prisoner.

Hence  he  must  formulate  charges  against  him  to  go  before 
Caesar. 

13.  When  certain  days  were  passed  {Hemeron  diageno- 
menon).  Genitive  absolute  of  diaginomai,  to  come  between, 
"days  intervening."  Agrippa  the  King  {Agrippas  ho  basi- 
leus).  Agrippa  II  son  of  Agrippa  I  of  Acts  12:20-23.  On  the 
death  of  Herod  King  of  Chalcis  a.d.  48,  Claudius  a.d.  50 
gave  this  Herod  Agrippa  II  the  throne  of  Chalcis  so  that 
Luke  is  correct  in  calling  him  king,  though  he  is  not  king 
of  Judea.  But  he  was  also  given  by  Claudius  the  govern- 
ment of  the  temple  and  the  right  of  appointing  the  high 
priest.  Later  he  was  given  also  the  tetrarchies  of  Philip  and 
Lysanias.  He  was  the  last  Jewish  king  in  Palestine,  though 
not  king  of  Judea.  He  angered  the  Jews  by  building  his 
palace  so  as  to  overlook  the  temple  and  by  frequent  changes 
in  the  high  priesthood.  He  made  his  capital  at  Caesarea 
Philippi  which  he  called  Neronias  in  honour  of  Nero.  Titus 
visited  it  after  the  fall  of  Jerusalem.  Bernice  (Bernike). 
He  was  her  brother  and  yet  she  lived  with  him  in  shameful 
intimacy  in  spite  of  her  marriage  to  her  uncle  Herod  King 
of  Chalcis  and  to  Polemon  King  of  Cilicia  whom  she  left. 
Schuerer  calls  her  both  a  Jewish  bigot  and  a  wanton.  She 
afterwards  became  the  mistress  of  Titus.  Arrived  at  Caesarea 
{katentesan  eis  Kaisarian).  Came  down  (first  aorist  active 
of  katantab)  to  Caesarea  from  Jerusalem,  And  saluted  Festus 
(aspasamenoi  ton  Pheston).  The  Textus  Receptus  has 
aspasomenoi  the  future  participle,  but  the  correct  text  is  the 
aorist  middle  participle  aspasamenoi  which  cannot  possibly 
mean  subsequent  action  as  given  in  the  Canterbury  Revi- 
sion "and  saluted."  It  can  only  mean  contemporaneous 
(simultaneous)  action  "saluting"  or  antecedent  action 
like  the  margin  "having  saluted."  But  antecedent  action 
is  not  possible  here,  so  that  simultaneous  action  is  the  only 
alternative.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  the  salutation  synchro- 
nized with  the  arrival  in  Caesarea  (note  kata,  down,  the  effec- 


434      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

tive  aorist  tense),  not  with  the  departure  from  Jerusalem, 
nor  with  the  whole  journey.  Rightly  understood  the  aorist 
participle  here  gives  no  trouble  at  all  (Robertson,  Grammar^ 
pp.  861-3). 

14.  Tarried  {dietribon).  Imperfect  active  of  diatriboj 
common  verb  for  spending  time  (Acts  12:19,  etc.).  Many 
days  (pleious  hemeras).  More  days  (than  a  few).  Accusa- 
tive case  for  extent  of  time.  Laid  PauVs  case  {anetluto  ta 
kata  ton  Paulon).  Second  aorist  middle  indicative  of  anati- 
themi,  old  verb  to  set  before,  to  place  up,  as  if  for  consulta- 
tion in  conference.  Only  twice  in  N.T.  here  and  Gal.  2:2. 
The  motive  of  Festus  is  not  given,  though  it  was  natural 
enough  in  view  of  the  quandary  of  Festus  about  Paul  (the 
things  about  Paul)  and  Agrippa's  interest  in  and  responsibil- 
ity for  Jewish  worship  in  the  temple  in  Jerusalem.  It  is  quite 
possible  that  Festus  had  a  bit  of  ennui  over  the  visit  of  these 
Jewish  dignitaries  as  "more  days"  went  by.  Hence  the  tone 
of  Festus  about  Paul  in  this  proposal  for  the  entertainment 
of  Agrippa  and  Bernice  is  certainly  one  of  superficial  and  su- 
premely supercilious  indifference.  Left  a  prisoner  (katalelim- 
menos  desmios).  Perfect  passive  participle  of  kataleipd,  to 
leave  behind.  Paul  is  one  of  Felix's  left  overs  (left  behind), 
a  sort  of  "junk"  left  on  his  hands.  This  cowardly  Roman 
procurator  thus  pictures  the  greatest  of  living  men  and  the 
greatest  preacher  of  all  time  to  this  profligate  pair  (brother 
and  sister)  of  sinners.  Undoubtedly  today  in  certain  circles 
Christ  and  his  preachers  are  held  up  to  like  contempt. 

15.  Informed  (enephanisan).  Same  word  as  in  23:15,  22; 
25 :2  which  see.  Asking  for  sentence  against  him  (aitoumenoi 
kat*  autou  katadiken).  Only  N.T.  example  of  this  old  word 
(penalty,  fine,  condemnation)  from  kata  and  dike  (justice 
against). 

16.  It  is  not  the  custom  of  the  Romans  (hoti  ouk  estin  ethos 
Rbmaiois).  If  a  direct  quotation,  hoti  is  recitative  as  in  Au- 
thorized Version.    Canterbury  Revision  takes  it  as  indirect 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  435 

discourse  after  apekrithen  (I  answered),  itself  in  a  relative 
clause  {pros  hous)  with  the  present  tense  {estin,  is)  pre- 
served as  is  usual.  There  is  a  touch  of  disdain  (Furneaux) 
in  the  tone  of  Festus.  He  may  refer  to  a  demand  of  the  Jews 
before  they  asked  that  Paul  be  brought  to  Jerusalem  (25:3). 
At  any  rate  there  is  a  tone  of  scorn  towards  the  Jews.  Before 
that  the  accused  have  (prin  e  ho  kaiegoroumenos  echoi).  This 
use  of  the  optative  in  this  temporal  clause  with  prin  e  instead 
of  the  subjunctive  an  echei  is  in  conformity  with  literary 
Greek  and  occurs  only  in  Luke's  writings  in  the  N.T.  (Rob- 
ertson, Grammar,  p.  970).  This  sequence  of  modes  is  a  mark 
of  the  literary  style  occasionally  seen  in  Luke.  It  is  interest- 
ing here  to  note  the  succession  of  dependent  clauses  in  verses 
14  to  16.  The  accusers  face  to  face  (kata  prosopon  tous  kate- 
gorous).  Same  word  kategoros  as  in  23:30,  35;  25:18.  This 
all  sounds  fair  enough.  j4nd  have  had  opportunity  to  make 
his  defence  concerning  the  matter  laid  against  him  {topon  te 
apologias  laboi  peri  tou  egklematos).  Literally,  "And  should 
receive  (laboi  optative  for  same  reason  as  echoi  above, 
second  aorist  active  of  lamhano)  opportunity  for  defence 
(objective  genitive)  concerning  the  charge"  {egklematos  in 
N.T.  only  here  and  23:19  which  see). 

17.  When  they  were  come  together  here  {sunelthonton  en- 
thade).  Genitive  absolute  of  second  aorist  active  participle 
of  sunerchomai,  but  without  auton  (they),  merely  under- 
stood. Delay  (anabolen).  Old  word  from  anaballo,  only 
here  in  N.T. 

18.  Brought  (epheron).  Imperfect  active  of />Afro,  referring 
to  their  repeated  charges.  Of  such  evil  things  as  I  supposed 
{Hon  ego  hupenooun  poneron).  Incorporation  of  the  antece- 
dent poneron  into  the  relative  clause  and  change  of  the  case 
of  the  relative  from  the  accusative  ha  object  of  hupenooun 
to  the  genitive  like  poneron  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  719). 
Note  the  imperfect  active  hupenooun  of  huponoeo  to  empha- 
size Festus's  state  of  mind  about  Paul  before  the  trial.  This 


436      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

old  verb  only  three  times  in  the  N.T.  (here,  Acts  13 :25  which 
see;   27:27). 

19.  But  had  {de  eichon).  Descriptive  imperfect  active  of 
echo  and  de  of  contrast  (but).  Concerning  their  own  religion 
{peri  tes  idias  deisidaimonias) .  See  on  17:22  for  discussion 
of  this  word.  Fes.tus  would  hardly  mean  "superstition," 
whatever  he  really  thought,  because  Agrippa  was  a  Jew. 
And  of  one  Jesus  {kai  peri  tinos  lesou).  This  is  the  climax 
of  supercilious  scorn  toward  both  Paul  and  "one  Jesus." 
Who  was  dead  (tethnekotos).  Perfect  active  participle  of 
thnesko  agreeing  with  lesou  (genitive).  As  being  dead. 
Whom  Paul  affirmed  to  he  alive  {hon  ephasken  ho  Paulos 
zein).  Imperfect  active  of  phasko,  old  form  of  phemi  to 
say,  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Acts  24:9;  Rom.  i  :22.  Infini- 
tive zein  in  indirect  discourse  with  hon  (whom)  the  accusa- 
tive of  general  reference.  With  all  his  top-loftical  airs  Festus 
has  here  correctly  stated  the  central  point  of  Paul's  preaching 
about  Jesus  as  no  longer  dead,  but  living. 

20.  Being  perplexed  (aporoumenos).  Present  middle  par- 
ticiple of  the  common  verb  aporeo  {a  privative  and  poros 
way),  to  be  in  doubt  which  way  to  turn,  already  in  Mark  6:20 
which  see  and  Luke  24:4.  The  Textus  Receptus  has  eis 
after  here,  but  critical  text  has  only  the  accusative  which 
this  verb  allows  (Mark  6:20)  as  in  Thucydides  and  Plato. 
How  to  inquire  concerning  these  things  (ten  peri  touton  zetesin). 
Literally,  "as  to  the  inquiry  concerning  these  things." 
This  is  not  the  reason  given  by  Luke  in  verse  9  (wanting  to 
curry  favour  with  the  Jews),  but  doubtless  this  motive  also 
actuated  Festus  as  both  could  be  true.  Whether  he  would  go  to 
Jerusalem  {ei  bouloito  poreuesthai  eis  lerosoluma).  Optative  in 
indirect  question  after  elegon  (asked  or  said)  imperfect  active, 
though  the  present  indicative  could  have  been  retained  with 
change  of  person:  "Dost  thou  wish,  etc.,"  {ei  bouleiy  etc.). 
See  Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  103 1,  1044.  This  is  the  question 
put  to  Paul  in  verse  9  though  theleis  is  there  used. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  437 

21.  When  Paul  had  appealed  (tou  Paulou  epikalesamenou). 
Genitive  absolute  with  first  aorist  middle  participle  of 
epikaleomaij  the  technical  word  for  appeal  (verses  11  and  12). 
The  first  aorist  passive  infinitive  terethenai  (to  be  kept)  is 
the  object  of  the  participle.  For  the  decision  of  the  emperor 
{eis  ten  tou  Sebastou  diagnosin).  Diagnosin  (cf.  diagnosomai 
24:22,  I  will  determine)  is  the  regular  word  for  a  legal  ex- 
amination (cognitio),  thorough  sifting  (dia),  here  only  in 
N.T.  Instead  of  "the  Emperor"  it  should  be  "the  Augus- 
tus," as  Sebastos  is  simply  the  Greek  translation  of  Augustus^ 
the  adjective  (Revered,  Reverent)  assumed  by  Octavius 
B.C.  27  as  the  agnomen  that  summed  up  all  his  various  offices 
instead  of  Rex  so  offensive  to  the  Romans  having  led  to  the 
death  of  Julius  Caesar.  The  successors  of  Octavius  assumed 
Augustus  as  a  title.  The  Greek  term  Sebastos  has  the  notion 
of  worship  (cf.  sebasma  in  Acts  17:25).  In  the  N.T.  only 
here,  verse  25,  and  27:1  (of  the  legion).  It  was  more  imposing 
than  "Caesar"  which  was  originally  a  family  name  (always 
official  in  the  N.T.)  and  it  fell  in  with  the  tendency  toward 
emperor-worship  which  later  played  such  a  large  part  in 
Roman  life -and  which  Christians  opposed  so  bitterly.  China 
is  having  a  revival  of  this  idea  in  the  insistence  on  bowing 
three  times  to  the  picture  of  Sun-Yat-Sen.  Till  I  should  send 
him  to  Caesar  {heds  an  anapempso  auton  pros  Kaisara).  Here 
anapempso  can  be  either  future  indicative  or  first  aorist 
subjunctive  (identical  in  first  person  singular),  aorist  sub- 
junctive the  usual  construction  with  hebs  for  future  time 
(Robertson,  Grammar ,  p.  876).  Literally,  "send  up"  {ana) 
to  a  superior  (the  emperor).  Common  in  this  sense  in  the 
papyri  and  Koin&  writers.  Here  "Caesar"  is  used  as  the  title 
of  Nero  instead  of  "Augustus"  as  Kurios  (Lord)  occurs  in 
verse  26. 

22.  /  also  could  wish  (eboulomen  kai  autos).  The  imperfect 
for  courtesy,  rather  than  the  blunt  boulomai,  I  wish,  I  want. 
Literally,  "I  myself  also  was  wishing"   (while  you  were 


438      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

talking),  a  compliment  to  the  interesting  story  told  by  Fes- 
tus.  The  use  of  an  with  the  imperfect  would  really  mean 
that  he  does  not  wish  (a  conclusion  of  the  second  class  condi- 
tion, determined  as  unfulfilled).  /4n  with  the  optative  would 
show  only  a  languid  desire.  The  imperfect  is  keen  enough 
and  yet  polite  enough  to  leave  the  decision  with  Festus  if  in- 
convenient for  any  reason  (Robertson,  Grammar,  pp.  885-7). 
Agrippa  may  have  heard  much  about  Christianity. 

23.  When  Agrippa  was  come  and  Bernice  {elthontos  tou 
Agrippa  kai  tes  Bernikes).  Genitive  absolute,  the  participle 
agreeing  in  number  and  gender  (masculine  singular,  elthontos) 
with  Agrippa,  Bernikes  being  added  as  an  afterthought. 
With  great  pomp  (meta  polles  phantasias).  Phantasia  is  a 
Koini  word  (Polybius,  Diodorus,  etc.)  from  the  old  verb 
phantazo  (Heb.  12:21)  and  it  from  phaino,  common  verb  to 
show,  to  make  an  appearance.  This  is  the  only  N.T.  example 
of  phantasia,  though  the  kindred  common  word  phantasma 
(appearance)  occurs  twice  in  the  sense  of  apparition  or 
spectre  (Matt.  14:26;  Mark  6:49).  Herodotus  (VII.  10)  used 
the  verb  phantazo  for  a  showy  parade.  Festus  decided  to 
gratify  the  wish  of  Agrippa  by  making  the  "hearing"  of 
Paul  the  prisoner  (verse  22)  an  occasion  for  paying  a  com- 
pliment to  Agrippa  (Rackham)  by  a  public  gathering  of  the 
notables  in  Caesarea.  Festus  just  assumed  that  Paul  would 
fall  in  with  this  plan  for  a  grand  entertainment  though  he 
did  not  have  to  do  it.  Into  the  place  of  hearing  (eis  to  akroa- 
terion).  From  akroaomai  (to  be  a  hearer)  and,  like  the 
Latin  auditorium,  in  Roman  law  means  the  place  set  aside 
for  hearing,  and  deciding  cases.  Here  only  in  the  N.T.  Late 
word,  several  times  in  Plutarch  and  other  Koini  writers. 
The  hearing  was  "semi-official"  (Page)  as  is  seen  in  verse 
26.  With  the  chief  captains  {sun  te  chiliarchois) .  Chiliarchs, 
each  a  leader  of  a  thousand.  There  were  five  cohorts  of 
soldiers  stationed  in  Caesarea.  And  the  principal  mm  of  the 
city  {kai  andrasin  tois  kat^  exochen).   The  use  of  kat"  cxochen^ 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  439 

like  our  French  phrase  par  excellence,  occurs  here  only  in  the 
N.T.,  and  not  in  the  ancient  Greek,  but  it  is  found  in  in- 
scriptions of  the  first  century  a.d.  (Moulton  and  Milligan's 
Vocabulary).  Exoche  in  medical  writers  is  any  protuberance 
or  swelling.  Cf.  our  phrase  "outstanding  men."  At  the 
command  of  Fesius  {keleusantos  tou  Phestou).  Genitive  ab- 
solute again,  "Festus  having  commanded." 

24.  Which  are  here  present  with  us  {hoi  sunparontes  hemin). 
Present  articular  participle  of  sunpareimi  (only  here  in  N.T.) 
with  associative  instrumental  case  hemin.  Made  suit  to  me 
(enetuchon  moi).  Second  aorist  active  indicative  of  entug- 
chano,  old  verb  to  fall  in  with  a  person,  to  go  to  meet  for 
consultation  or  supplication  as  here.  Common  in  old  Greek 
and  Koine.  Cf.  Rom.  8:27,  34.  See  enteuxis  (petition)  I  Tim. 
2:1.  Papyri  give  many  examples  of  the  technical  sense  of 
enteuxis  as  petition  (Deissmann,  Bible  Studies,  p.  121). 
Some  MSS.  have  plural  here  enetuchon  rather  than  the 
singular  enetuchen.  Crying  (boontes).  Yelling  and  demand- 
ing with  loud  voices.  That  he  ought  not  to  live  any  longer  {me 
dein  auton  zein  meketi).  Indirect  command  (demand)  with 
the  infinitive  dein  for  dei  (it  is  necessary).  The  double  nega- 
tive {me — meketi)  with  zein  intensifies  the  demand. 

25.  But  I  found  {ego  de  katelabomen) .  Second  aorist 
middle  of  katalambano,  to  lay  hold  of,  to  grasp,  to  compre- 
hend as  in  4:13 ;  10:34.  That  he  had  committed  nothing  worthy 
of  death  {meden  axion  auton  thanatou  peprachenai).  Perfect 
active  infinitive  of  prasso  in  indirect  assertion  with  negative 
me  and  accusative  auton  of  general  reference,  the  usual 
idiom.  Verse  25  repeats  the  statement  in  verse  21,  perhaps 
for  the  benefit  of  the  assembled  dignitaries. 

26.  No  certain  thing  {asphales  ti  —  ou).  Nothing  definite 
or  reliable  {a  privative,  sphallo,  to  trip).  All  the  charges  of 
the  Sanhedrin  slipped  away  or  were  tripped  up  by  Paul. 
Festus  confesses  that  he  had  nothing  left  and  thereby  con- 
victs himvself  of  gross  insincerity  in  his  proposal  to  Paul  in 


440     WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

verse  9  about  going  up  to  Jerusalem.  By  his  own  statement 
he  should  have  set  Paul  free.  The  various  details  here  bear 
the  marks  of  the  eyewitness.  Luke  was  surely  present  and 
witnessed  this  grand  spectacle  with  Paul  as  chief  performer. 
Unto  my  lord  {toi  kurioi).  Augustus  (Octavius)  and  Tiberius 
refused  the  title  of  kurios  (lord)  as  too  much  like  rex  (king) 
and  like  master  and  slave,  but  the  servility  of  the  subjects 
gave  it  to  the  other  emperors  who  accepted  it  (Nero  among 
them).  Antoninus  Pius  put  it  on  his  coins.  Deissmann 
{Light  from  the  Ancient  East,  p.  105)  gives  an  ostracon  dated 
Aug.  4,  A.D.  63  with  the  words  "in  the  year  nine  of  Nero 
the  lord"  {enatou  Nerbnos  ton  kuriou).  Deissmann  {op.  cit.y 
pp.  349flF.)  runs  a  most  interesting  parallel  "between  the  cult 
of  Christ  and  the  cult  of  Caesar  in  the  application  of  the 
term  kurios,  lord"  in  ostraca,  papyri,  inscriptions.  Beyond 
a  doubt  Paul  has  all  this  fully  in  mind  when  he  says  in  I  Cor. 
12:3  that  "no  one  is  able  to  say  Kurios  lesous  except  in  the 
Holy  Spirit"  (cf.  also  Phil.  2:11).  The  Christians  claimed  this 
word  for  Christ  and  it  became  the  test  in  the  Roman  perse- 
cutions as  when  Polycarp  steadily  refused  to  say  "Lord 
Caesar"  and  insisted  on  saying  "Lord  Jesus"  when  it  meant 
his  certain  death.  Before  you  {eph*  humon).  The  whole 
company.  In  no  sense  a  new  trial,  but  an  examination  in 
the  presence  of  these  prominent  men  to  secure  data  and  to 
furnish  entertainment  and  pleasure  to  Agrippa  (verse  22). 
Especially  before  thee  {malista  epi  sou).  Out  of  courtesy.  It 
was  the  main  reason  as  verse  22  shows.  Agrippa  was  a  Jew 
and  Festus  was  glad  of  the  chance  to  see  what  he  thought 
of  Paul's  case.  After  examination  had  {tes  anakriseos  geno- 
menes).  Genitive  absolute,  "the  examination  having  taken 
place."  Anakrisis  from  anakrino  (cf.  12:19;  24:8;  28:18) 
is  a  legal  term  for  preliminary  examination.  Only  here  in  the 
N.T.  Inscriptions  and  papyri  give  it  as  examination  of 
slaves  or  other  property.  That  I  may  have  somewhat  to  zvrite 
{hopos  scho  ti  grapso).     Ingressive  aorist  subjunctive  scho 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  441 

(may  get)  with  hopos  (final  particle  like  hina).  Ti  grapso  in 
indirect  question  after  scho  is  either  future  indicative  or 
aorist  subjunctive  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1045).  Festus 
makes  it  plain  that  this  is  not  a  "trial,"  but  an  examination 
for  his  convenience  to  help  him  out  of  a  predicament. 

27.  Unreasonable  {alogon).  Old  word  from  a  privative  and 
logos  (reason,  speech).  "Without  reason"  as  of  animals 
(Jude  10;  II  Peter  2:12),  "contrary  to  reason"  here.  These 
the  only  N.T.  instances  and  ih  harmony  with  ancient  usage. 
In  sending  {pemponta).  Note  accusative  case  with  the  infini- 
tive semdnai  though  moi  (dative)  just  before.  Cf.  same 
variation  in  I5:22f.;  22:17.  Signify  (semdnai).  First  aorist 
active  infinitive  (not  semenai,  the  old  fojm)  of  semaino,  to 
give  a  sign  (semeion).  The  charges  (tas  aitias).  This  naive 
confession  of  Festus  reveals  how  unjust  has  been  his  whole 
treatment  of  Paul.  He  had  to  send  along  with  the  appeal 
of  Paul  litter ae  dimissoriae  (apostoli)  which  would  give  a 
statement  of  the  case  (Page).  • 


CHAPTER  XXVI 

1.  Thou  art  permitted  {epitrepetai  sot).  Literally,  It  is 
permitted  thee.  As  if  Agrippa  were  master  of  ceremonies 
instead  of  Festus.  Agrippa  as  a  king  and  guest  presides  at 
the  grand  display  while  Festus  has  simply  introduced  Paul. 
for  thyself  (huper  seauiou).  Some  MSS.  have  peri  (concern- 
ing). Paul  is  allowed  to  speak  in  his  own  behalf.  No  charges 
are  made  against  him.  In  fact,  Festus  has  admitted  that  he 
has  no  real  proof  of  any  charges.  Stretched  forth  his  hand 
{ekteinas  ten  cheira).  Dramatic  oratorical  gesture  (not  for 
silence  as  in  12:17;  13:16)  with  the  chain  still  upon  it  (verse 
29)  linking  him  to  the  guard.  First  aorist  active  participle 
of  ekteinOj  to  stretch  out.  Made  his  defence  (apelogeito).  In- 
choative imperfect  of  apologeomai  (middle),  "began  to  make 
his  defence."  This  is  the  fullest  of  all  Paul's  defences.  He 
has  no  word  of  censure  of  his  enemies  or  of  resentment,  but 
seizes  the  opportunity  to  preach  Christ  to  such  a  distin- 
guished company  which  he  does  with  "singular  dignity" 
(Furneaux).  He  is  now  bearing  the  name  of  Christ  "before 
kings"  (Acts  9:15).  In  general  Paul  follows  the  line  of  argu- 
ment of  the  speech  on  the  stairs  (chapter  22). 

2.  /  think  myself  happy  (hegemai  emauton  makarion).  See 
on  Matt.  5:3  for  makarios.  Blass  notes  that  Paul,  like 
Tertullus,  begins  with  captatio  benevolentiae,  but  absque 
adulatione.  He  says  only  what  he  can  truthfully  speak.  For 
hegemai  see  Phil.  3:7;  I  Tim.  6:1  (perfect  middle  indicative 
of  hegeomai)j  I  have  considered.  That  I  am  to  make  my 
defence  {mellon  apologeisthai).  Literally,  "being  about  to 
make  my  defence."  Whereof  I  am  accused  {hon  egkaloumai). 
Genitive  with  egkaloumai  as  in  19:40  or  by  attraction  from 
accusative  of  relative  {ha)  to  case  of  antecedent  (panton). 

442 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  443 

3.  Especially  because  thou  art  expert  {malista  gnosten  onta 
se).  Or  like  the  margin,  "because  thou  art  especially  expert," 
according  as  malista  is  construed.  Gnosten  is  from  ginosko 
and  means  a  knower,  expert,  connoisseur.  Plutarch  uses  it 
and  Deissmann  {Light,  etc.,  p.  367)  restores  it  in  a  papyrus. 
Agrippa  had  the  care  of  the  temple,  the  appointment  of  the 
high  priest,  and  the  care  of  the  sacred  vestments.  But  the 
accusative  onta  se  gives  trouble  here  coming  so  soon  after 
sou  (genitive  with  epi).  Some  MSS.  insert  epistamenos  or 
eidos  (knowing)  but  neither  is  genuine.  Page  takes  it  as 
"governed  by  the  sense  of  thinking  or  considering."  Knowl- 
ing  considers  it  an  anacoluthon.  Buttmann  held  it  to  be  an 
accusative  absolute  after  the  old  Greek  idiom.  Tuchon  is 
such  an  instance  though  used  as  an  adverb  (I  Cor.  16:6). 
It  is  possible  that  one  exists  in  Eph.  i  :i8.  See  other  examples 
discussed  in  Robertson's  Grammar,  pp.  49of.  Customs  and 
questions  (ethon  te  kai  zetematbn).  Both  consuetudinum  in 
practicis  and  quaestionum  in  theoreticis  (Bengel).  Agrippa 
was  qualified  to  give  Paul  an  understanding  and  a  sympa- 
thetic hearing.  Paul  understands  perfectly  the  grand-stand 
play  of  the  whole  performance,  but  he  refused  to  be  silent 
and  chose  to  use  this  opportunity,  slim  as  it  seemed,  to  get  a 
fresh  hearing  for  his  own  case  and  to  present  the  claims  of 
Christ  to  this  influential  man.  His  address  is  a  masterpiece  of 
noble  apologetic.  Patiently  (makrothumos) .  Adverb  from 
makrothumos.  Only  here  in  the  N.T.,  though  makrothumia 
occurs  several  times.  Vulgate  has  longanimiter.  Long  spirit, 
endurance,  opposite  of  impatience.    So  Paul  takes  his  time. 

4.  My  manner  of  life  {ten  men  oun  biosin  mou).  With 
men  oun  Paul  passes  from  the  captatio  benevolentiae  (verses 
I  and  2)  "to  the  narratio  or  statement  of  his  case"  (Page). 
Bibsis  Is  from  biob  (I  Peter  4:2)  and  that  from  bios  (course 
of  life).  This  is  the  only  instance  of  bibsis  yet  found  except 
the  Prologue  (10)  of  Ecclesiasticus  and  an  inscription  given 
in  Ramsay's  Cities  and  Bishoprics  of  Phrygia,  Vol.  IT,  p.  650. 


444      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Know  (isasi).  Literary  form  instead  of  the  vernacular  KoinS 
oidasin.  Paul's  early  life  in  Tarsus  and  Jerusalem  was  an 
open  book  to  all  Jews. 

5.  Having  knowledge  of  me  from  the  first  {proginbskontes  me 
anbthen).  Literally,  "knowing  me  beforehand"  (both  pro 
and  anothen),  from  the  beginning  of  Paul's  public  education 
in  Jerusalem  (Knowling).  Cf.  II  Peter  3:17.  //  they  he 
willing  to  testify  (ean  thelosin  marturein).  Condition  of  third 
class  {ean  and  subjunctive).  A  neat  turning  of  the  tables 
on  the  distinguished  audience  about  Paul's  Jerusalem  repu- 
tation before  his  conversion.  After  the  straitest  sect  {ten 
akrihestaten  hairesin).  This  is  a  true  superlative  (not  ela- 
tive)  and  one  of  the  three  (also  hagiotatos,  Jude  20,  timiotatos 
Rev.  18:12;  21  :ii)  superlatives  in -tatos  in  the  N.T.  (Robert- 
son, Grammar,  pp.  279f.,  670),  though  common  enough  in 
the  LXX  and  the  papyri.  Hairesin  (choosing)  is  properly 
used  here  with  Pharisees  (Josephus,  Life,  38).  Religion 
{threskeias).  From  threskeub  and  this  from  threskos  (James 
1 :26),  old  word  for  religious  worship  or  discipline,  common  in 
the  papyri  and  inscriptions  (Moulton  and  Milligah's  Vocab- 
ulary) for  reverent  worship,  not  mere  external  ritual.  In 
N.T.  only  here,  James  i:26f.;  Col.  2:18.  /  lived  a  Pharisee 
{ezesa  Pharisaios).  Emphatic  position.  Paul  kneW  the  rules 
of  the  Pharisees  and  played  the  game  to  the  full  (Gal.  1:14; 
Phil.  3:5f.).  The  Talmud  makes  it  plain  what  the  life  of  a 
Pharisee  was.  Paul  had  become  one  of  the  leaders  and  stars 
of  hope  for  his  sect. 

6.  And  now  {kai  nun).  Sharp  comparison  between  his 
youth  and  the  present.  To  be  judged  for  the  hope  {ep^  elpidi  — 
krinomenos).  The  hope  of  the  resurrection  and  of  the  prom- 
ised Messiah  (13:32).  Page  calls  verses  6  to  8  a  parenthesis 
in  the  course  of  Paul's  argument  by  which  he  shows  that 
his  life  in  Christ  is  a  real  development  of  the  best  in  Phari- 
saism. He  does  resume  his  narrative  in  verse  9,  but  verses 
6  to  8  are  the  core  of  his  defence  already  presented  in  Gal.  3 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  445 

and  Rom.  9  to  1 1  where  he  proves  that  the  children  of  faith 
are  the  real  seed  of  Abraham. 

7.  Our  twelve  tribes  {to  dodekaphulon  hemon).  A  word 
found  only  here  in  N.T.  and  in  Christian  and  Jewish  writ- 
ings, though  dodekamenon  (twelve  month)  is  common  in  the 
papyri  and  dekaphulos  (ten  tribes)  in  Herodotus.  Paul's 
use  of  this  word  for  the  Jewish  people,  like  James  1:1  {tats 
dodeka  phulais,  the  twelve  tribes),  shows  that  Paul  had  no 
knowledge  of  any  "lost  ten  tribes."  There  is  a  certain  na- 
tional pride  and  sense  of  unity  in  spite  of  the  dispersion 
(Page).  Earnestly  {en  ekteneidi).  A  late  word  from  ekteinb, 
to  stretch  out,  only  here  in  N.T.,  but  in  papyri  and  in- 
scriptions. Page  refers  to  Simeon  and  Anna  (Luke  2:25-28) 
as  instances  of  Jews  looking  for  the  coming  of  the  Messiah. 
Note  the  accusative  of  nukta  kai  hemeran  as  in  20:31.  Hope 
to  attain  {elpizei  katantesai) .  This  Messianic  hope  had  been 
the  red  thread  running  through  Jewish  history.  Today,  alas, 
it  is  a  sadly  worn  thread  for  Jews  who  refuse  to  see  the  Mes- 
siah in  Jesus.  /  am  accused  by  Jews  {egkaloumai  hupo  lou- 
daion).  The  very  word  used  in  23:28  {enekaloun)  which  see, 
and  by  Jews  of  all  people  in  the  world  whose  mainspring 
was  this  very  "hope."    It  is  a  tremendously  effective  turn. 

8.  Incredible  with  you  {apiston  par''  humin).  This  old 
word  apiston  {a  privative  and  pistos)  means  either  unfaith- 
ful (Luke  12:46),  unbelieving  (John  20:27),  or  unbelievable 
as  here).  Paul  turns  suddenly  from  Agrippa  to  the  audience 
{par^  humin,  plural),  most  of  whom  were  probably  Gentiles 
and  scouted  the  doctrine  of  the  resurrection  as  at  Athens 
(17:32).  //  God  doth  raise  the  dead  {ei  ho  theos  nekrous  egeirei). 
Condition  of  the  first  class  assuming  that  God  does  raise 
dead  people.  Only  God  can  do  it.  This  rhetorical  question 
needs  no  answer,  though  the  narrative  resumed  in  verse  9 
does  it  in  a  way. 

9.  /  verily  thought  with  myself  {ego  men  oun  edoxa  emautoi). 
Personal    construction  instead  of  the  impersonal,  a  touch 


446      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

of  the  literary  style.  Paul's  "egoism"  is  deceived  as  so  often 
happens.  /  ought  (dein).  Infinitive  the  usual  construction 
with  dokeb.  Necessity  and  a  sense  of  duty  drove  Paul  on 
even  in  this  great  sin  (see  on  23:1),  a  common  failing  with 
persecutors.  Contrary  {enantia).  Old  word  (adjective), 
over  against,  opposite  (Acts  27:4),  then  hostile  to  as  here. 

10.  /  both  shut  up  many  {pollous  te  katekleisa).  Effective 
aorist  active  of  katakleio,  old  word  to  shut  down  like  a  trap 
door,  in  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  3:20.  Double  use  of  te 
(both — and).  Having  received  authority  from  the  chief  priests 
{ten  para  ton  archiereon  exousian  labbn).  "The  authority," 
he  says,  Paul  was  the  official  persecutor  of  the  saints  under 
the  direction  of  the  Sanhedrin.  He  mentions  "chief  priests" 
(Sadducees),  though  a  Pharisee  himself.  Both  parties  were 
co-operating  against  the  saints.  And  when  they  were  put  to 
death  {anairoumenon  te  auton).  Genitive  absolute  with 
present  passive  participle  of  anaireo.  I  gave  my  vote  against 
them  {katenegka  psephon).  "I  cast  down  my  pebble"  (a 
black  one).  The  ancient  Greeks  used  white  pebbles  for 
acquittal  (Rev.  2:17),  black  ones  for  condemnation  as  here 
(the  only  two  uses  of  the  word  in  the N.T.). Paul's  phrase 
(not  found  elsewhere)  is  more  vivid  than  the  usual  katapse- 
phizo  for  voting.  They  literally  cast  the  pebbles  into  the  urn. 
Cf.  sumps ephizo  in  Acts  19:19,  sugkatapsephizo  in  Acts 
I  '.26.  If  Paul's  language  is  taken  literally  here,  he  was  a 
member  of  the  Sanhedrin  and  so  married  when  he  led  the 
persecution.  That  is  quite  possible,  though  he  was  not 
married  when  he  wrote  I  Cor.  7:7f.,  but  a  widower.  It  is 
possible  to  take  the  language  figuratively  for  approval,  but 
not  so  natural. 

11.  Punishing  (timoron).  Old  word  timoreo  originally 
to  render  help,  to  succor  {timoros,  from  time  and  ouros)^ 
then  to  avenge  (for  honour).  In  N.T.  only  here  and  22:5. 
/  strove  to  make  them  blaspheme  (enagkazon  blasphemein). 
Conative  imperfect  active  of  anagkazo,  old  verb  from  anagke 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  447 

(necessity,  compulsion).  The  tense,  like  the  imperfect  in 
Matt.  3:14;  Luke  1:59,  leaves  room  to  hope  that  Paul  was 
not  successful  in  this  effort,  for  he  had  already  said  that  he 
brought  many  "unto  death"  (22:4).  /  persecuted  (ediokon). 
Imperfect  active  again,  repeated  attempts.  The  old  verb 
dioko  was  used  to  run  after  or  chase  game  and  then  to  chase 
enemies.  The  word  "persecute"  is  the  Latin  persequor^ 
to  follow  through  or  after.  It  is  a  vivid  picture  that  Paul 
here  paints  of  his  success  in  hunting  big  game,  a  grand 
heresy  hunt.  Even  unto  foreign  cities  (kai  eis  exo  poleis). 
We  know  of  Damascus,  and  Paul  evidently  planned  to  go 
to  other  cities  outside  of  Palestine  and  may  even  have  done 
so  before  the  fateful  journey  to  Damascus. 

12.  Whereupon  {en  hois).  "In  which  things"  (affairs  of 
persecution),  "on  which  errand."  Cf.  24:18.  Paul  made 
them  leave  Palestine  (11:19)  ^^^  followed  them  beyond  it 
(9:2).  With  the  authority  and  commission  (met^  exousias.  kai 
epitropes).  Not  merely  "authority"  {exousia),  but  express 
appointment  {epitrope,  old  word,  but  here  only  in  N.T.,  de- 
rived from  epitropos,  steward,  and  that  iroin^pitrepd,  to  turn 
over  to,  to  commit). 

13.  At  midday  {hemeras  meses).  Genitive  of  time  and 
idiomatic  use  of  mesos,  in  the  middle  of  the  day,  more  vivid 
than  mesembrian  (22:6).  Above  the  brightness  of  the  sun 
{huper  ten  lamproteta  tou  heliou).  Here  alone  not  in  Acts 
9  or  22,  though  implied  in  9:3  and  22:6,  "indicating  the 
supernatural  character  of  the  light"  (Knowling).  Luke 
makes  no  effort  to  harmonize  the  exact  phrases  here  with 
those  in  the  other  accounts  and  Paul  here  (verse  16)  blends 
together  what  Jesus  said  to  him  directly  and  the  message 
of  Jesus  through  Ananias  (9:15).  The  word  lamprotes,  old 
word,  is  here  alone  in  the  N.T.  Shining  round  about  me 
{perilampsan  me).  First  aorist  active  participle  of  perilampo, 
common  KoinS  verb,  in  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  2  :g. 

14.  When  we  were  all  fallen  (panton  katapesonton  hemon). 


448      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Genitive  absolute  with  second  aorist  active  participle  of 
katapipto.  In  the  Hebrew  language  {tei  Ebraidi  dialektoi). 
Natural  addition  here,  for  Paul  is  speaking  in  Greek,  not 
Aramaic  as  in  22:2.  It  is  hard  for  thee  to  kick  against  the  goad 
{skleron  soi  pros  kentra  laktizein).  Genuine  here,  but  not  in 
chapters  9  and  22.  A  common  proverb  as  Aeschylus  Ag. 
1624:  Pros  kentra  me  laktize.  "It  is  taken  from  an  ox  that 
being  pricked  with  a  goad  kicks  and  receives  a  severer 
wound"  (Page).  Cf.  the  parables  of  Jesus  (Matt.  13:35). 
Blass  observes  that  Paul's  mention  of  this  Greek  and  Latin 
proverb  is  an  indication  of  his  culture.  Besides  he  mentions 
(not  invents)  it  here  rather  than  in  chapter  22  because  of 
the  culture  of  this  audience.  Kentron  means  either  sting  as 
of  bees  (II  Mace.  14:19)  and  so  of  death  (I  Cor.  15:55)  or  an 
iron  goad  in  the  ploughman's  hand  as  here  (the  only  two 
N.T.  examples).  Note  plural  here  (goads)  and  laktizein  is 
present  active  infinitive  so  that  the  idea  is  "to  keep  on  kick- 
ing against  goads."  This  old  verb  means  to  kick  with  the 
heel  (adverb  lax,  with  the  heel),  but  only  here  in  the  N.T. 
There  is  a  papyrus  example  of  kicking  {laktizo)  with  the  feet 
against  the  door. 

16.  Arise  and  stand  (anastethi  kai  stetht).  "Emphatic 
assonance"  (Page).  Second  aorist  active  imperative  of 
compound  verb  (anistemi)  and  simplex  {histemi).  "Stand 
up  and  take  a  stand."  Have  I  appeared  unto  thee  (ophthen 
sot).  First  aorist  passive  indicative  of  horao.  See  on  Luke 
22:43.  To  appoint  thee  (procheirisasthai  se).  See  3:30  and 
22:14  for  this  verb.  Both  of  the  things  wherein  thou  hast 
seen  me  {hon  te  eides  me).  The  reading  me  (not  In  all  MSS.) 
makes  it  the  object  of  eides  (didst  see)  and  hon  is  genitive 
of  ha  (accusative  of  general  reference)  attracted  to  the  case 
of  the  unexpressed  antecedent  touton.  Paul  is  thus  a  personal 
eyewitness  of  the  Risen  Christ  (Luke  1:1;  I  Cor.  4:1;  9:1). 
And  of  the  things  wherein  I  will  appear  unto  thee  {hon  te 
ophthesomai  soi).    Here  again  hon  is  genitive  of  the  accusa- 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  449 

tive  (general  reference)  relative  ha  attracted  to  the  case  of 
the  antecedent  touton  or  ekeinon  as  before.  But  ophthesomai 
is  first  future  passive  of  horao  and  cannot  be  treated  as 
active  or  middle.  Page  takes  it  to  mean  "the  visions  in  which 
I  shall  be  seen  by  you,"  the  passive  form  bringing  out  the 
agency  of  God.  See  those  in  Acts  18:9;  23:11;  II  Cor.  12:2. 
The  passive  voice,  however,  like  apekrithen  and  ephobetheuj 
did  become  sometimes  .transitive  in  the  KoinS  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  p.  819). 

17.  Delivering  thee  (exairoumenos  se).  Present  middle  par- 
ticiple of  exaireo,  old  verb  and  usually  so  rendered,  but  the 
old  Greek  also  uses  it  for  "choose"  as  also  in  LXX  (Isa. 
48:10).  The  papyri  give  examples  of  both  meanings  and 
either  makes  good  sense  here.  God  was  continually  rescuing 
Paul  "out  of  the  hands  of  Jews  and  Gentiles  and  Paul  was 
a  chosen  vessel"  (9:15).    Modern  scholars  are  also  divided. 

18.  To  open  (anoixai).  First  aorist  active  infinitive  of 
purpose.  That  they  may  turn  {tou  epistrepsai) .  Another  infin- 
itive of  purpose  first  aorist  active  (genitive  case  and  articu- 
lar), epexegetic  to  anoixai.  That  they  may  receive  {tou  labein). 
Another  genitive  articular  infinitive  of  purpose  subordinate 
(epexegetic)  to  tou  epistrepsai.  Sanctified  hy  faith  in  me 
(hegiasmenois  pistei  tei  eis  eme).  Perfect  passive  participle 
of  hagiazo,  instrumental  case  of  pistei,  article  before  eis  eme 
("by  faith,  that  in  me").  These  important  words  of  Jesus  to 
Paul  give  his  justification  to  this  cultured  audience  for  his 
response  to  the  command  of  Jesus.  This  was  the  turning 
point  in  Paul's  career  and  it  was  a  step  forward  and  up- 
ward. 

19.  Wherefore  {hothen).  This  relatival  adverb  (cf.  14:26; 
28:13)  gathers  up  all  that  Paul  has  said.  /  was  not  disobedient 
{ouk  egenomen  apeithes).  Litotes  again,  "I  did  not  become 
(second  aorist  middle  indicative  of  ginomai)  disobedient" 
{apeithes,  old  word  already  in  Luke  i  :i7).  Unto  the  heavenly 
vision  {tei  ouranioi  optasidi).     A  later  form  of  opsis,  from 


450      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

optazo,  in  LXX,  and  in  N.T.  (Luke  1:22;  24:23;  Acts  26:19; 
II  Cor.  12:1).  Only  time  that  Paul  uses  it  about  seeing  Christ 
on  the  Damascus  road,  but  no  reflection  on  the  reality  of  the 
event. 

20.  But  declared  {alia  apeggellon).  Imperfect  active  of 
apaggelloj  repeatedly.  Throughout  all  the  country  of  Judea 
{pdsan  te  ten  chbran  tes  loudaias).  The  accusative  here  in 
the  midst  of  the  datives  {tois  en  Damask oi,  lerosolumois,  tois 
ethnesin)  seems  strange  and  Page  feels  certain  that  eis 
should  be  here  even  though  absent  in  Aleph  A  B.  But  the 
accusative  of  extent  of  space  will  explain  it  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  p.  469).  Doing  works  worthy  of  repentance  (axia 
tes  metanoias  erga  prassontas).  Accusative  case  of  present 
active  participle  prassontas  because  of  the  implied  autous 
with  the  present  infinitive  metanoein  (repent)  and  epis- 
trephein  (turn),  though  the  dative  prassousin  could  have 
been  used  to  agree  with  ethnesin  (Gentiles).  Cf.  Matt  3:8 
for  similar  language  used  of  the  Baptist.  Paul,  the  greatest 
of  theologians,  was  an  interesting  practical  preacher. 

21.  Assayed  to  kill  me  {epeironto  diacheirisasthai).  Con- 
ative  imperfect  middle  of  peirao,  the  old  form  of  the 
later  Koini  peirazo  so  common  in  the  KoinS,  but  in  N.T. 
here  only.  Some  MSS.  have  it  in  Acts  9:26  and  Heb.  4:15. 
The  old  verb  diacheirizo,  to  take  in  hand,  middle  to  lay 
hands  on,  to  slay,  occurs  in  N.T.  only  here  and  5:30  which 
see. 

22.  Having  therefore  obtained  (oun  tuchon).  Second  aorist 
active  participle  of  old  verb  tugchano.  The  help  that  is  from 
God  {epikourias  tes  apo  tou  theou).  Old  word  from  epikoureOj 
to  aid,  and  that  from  epikouros,  ally,  assister.  Only  here  in 
N.T.  God  is  Paul's  ally.  All  of  the  plots  of  the  Jews  against 
Paul  had  failed  so  far.  /  stand  (hesteka).  Second  perfect 
of  histemi,  to  place,  intransitive  to  stand.  Picturesque  word 
(Page)  of  Paul's  stability  and  fidelity  (cf.  Phil.  4:1;  Eph. 
6:13).   Both  to  small  and  great  (mikroi  te  kai  megaloi).  Dative 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  451 

singular  (rather  than  instrumental,  taking  marturoumenos 
middle,  not  passive)  and  use  of  te  kai  links  the  two  adjec- 
tives together  in  an  inclusive  way.  These  two  adjectives 
in  the  singular  (representative  singular  rather  than  plural) 
can  apply  to  age  (young  and  old)  or  to  rank  (Rev.  ii:i8) 
as  is  specially  suitable  here  with  Festus  and  Agrippa  present. 
In  Acts  8:10  (Heb.  8:11)  the  phrase  explains  pantes  (all). 
Saying  nothing  but  what  {ouden  ektos  legon  hon).  "Saying 
nothing  outside  of  those  things  which."  The  ablative  rela- 
tive hon  is  attracted  into  the  case  of  the  unexpressed  antece- 
dent teuton  and  so  ablative  after  ektos  (adverbial  preposition 
common  in  LXX,  the  papyri.  In  N.T.  here  and  I  Cor.  6:18; 
15:27;  II  Cor.  I2:2f.).  Cf.  Luke  16:29  about  Moses  and  the 
prophets. 

23.  How  that  the  Christ  must  suffer  {ei  pathetos  ho  Christos). 
Literally,  "if  the  Messiah  is  subject  to  suffering."  Ei  can 
here  mean  "whether"  as  in  Heb.  7:15.  This  use  of  a  verbal 
in  -tos  for  capability  or  possibility  occurs  in  the  N.T.  alone  in 
pathetos  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  157).  This  word  occurs  in 
Plutarch  in  this  sense.  It  is  like  the  Latin  patihilis  and  is 
from  pascho.  Here  alone  in  N.T.  Paul  is  speaking  from  the 
Jewish  point  of  view.  Most  rabbis  had  not  rightly  under- 
stood Isa.  53.  When  the  Baptist  called  Jesus  "the  Lamb  of 
God "  (John  i  :29)  it  was  a  startling  idea.  It  is  not  then 
"must  suffer"  here,  but  "can  suffer."  The  Cross  of  Christ 
was  a  stumbling-block  to  the  rabbis.  How  that  he  first  by  the 
resurrection  of  the  dead  {ei  protos  ex  anastaseos  nekrbn). 
Same  construction  with  ei  (whether).  This  point  Paul  had 
often  discussed  with  the  Jews:  "whether  he  (the  Messiah) 
by  a  resurrection  of  dead  people."  Others  had  been  raised 
from  the  dead,  but  Christ  is  the  first  {protos)  who  arose  from 
the  dead  and  no  longer  dies  (Rom.  6:19)  and  proclaims  light 
{phbs  mellei  kataggellein) .  Paul  is  still  speaking  from  the 
Jewish  standpoint:  "is  about  to  (going  to)  proclaim  light." 
See  verse  18  for  "light"  and  Luke  2:32.    Both  to  the  people 


452      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

and  to  the  Gentile^  (toi  te  laoi  kai  tots  ethnesin).  See  verse  17. 
It  was  at  the  word  Gentiles  (ethne)  that  the  mob  lost  con- 
trol of  themselves  in  the  speech  from  the  stairs  (22:2if.). 
So  it  is  here,  only  not  because  of  that  word,  but  because 
of  the  word  "resurrection"  (anastasis). 

24.  ^s  he  thus  made  his  defence  {tauta  autou  apologou- 
menou).  Genitive  absolute  again  with  present  middle 
participle.  Paul  was  still  speaking  when  Festus  interrupted 
him  in  great  excitement.  With  a  loud  voice  {megalei  tei 
phonei).  Associative  instrumental  case  showing  manner 
(Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  530)  and  the  predicate  use  of  the 
adjective,  "with  the  voice  loud"  (elevated).  Thou  art 
mad  (mainei).  Old  verb  for  raving.  See  also  John  10:20; 
Acts  12:15;  ^  ^o'"-  H'23-  The  enthusiasm  of  Paul  was  too 
much  for  Festus  and  then  he  had  spoken  of  visions  and  resur- 
rection from  the  dead  (verse  8).  "Thou  art  going  mad" 
(linear  present),  Festus  means.  Thy  much  learning  doth 
turn  thee  to  madness  {ta  polla  se  grammata  eis  manian  peri- 
trepei).  "Is  turning  thee  round."  Old  verb  peritrepo,  but 
only  here  in  N.T.  Festus  thought  that  Paul's  "much  learn- 
ing" (  =  "many  letters,"  cf.  John  7:15  of  Jesus)  of  the  He- 
brew Scriptures  to  which  he  had  referred  was  turning  his 
head  to  madness  (wheels  in  his  head)  and  he  was  going  mad 
right  before  them  all.  The  old  word  mania  (our  mania, 
frenzy,  cf.  maniac)  occurs  here  only  in  N.T.  Note  un- 
usual position  of  se  between  polla  and  grammata  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  pp.  418,  420) 

25.  But  speak  forth  [alia  apophtheggomai).  Verb  for  digni- 
fied and  elevated  discourse,  a  word  from  the  literary  KoinSj 
not  the  vernacular.  In  N.T.  only  here  and  2:4,  14  which  see. 
It  occurs  three  times  in  Vettius  Valens  in  a  "mantic"  sense. 
Paul  was  not  ruffled  by  the  rude  and  excited  interruption 
of  Festus,  but  speaks  with  perfect  courtesy  in  his  reply 
"words  of  truth  and  soberness."  The  old  word  sophrosune 
(soundness  of  mind)  from  sophron  (and  that  from  sos  and 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  453 

phren)  is  directly  opposed  to  "madness"  {mania)  and  in 
N.T.  occurs  only  here  and  I  Tim.  2:15. 

26.  For  the  king  knoweth  of  these  things  {epistatai  gar 
peri  touton  ho  basileus).  Epistatai  (present  middle  probably 
Ionic  form  of  ephistemi)  is  a  literary  word  and  suits  well 
here  (cf.  24:10).  Freely  (parresiazomenos).  Present  middle 
participle,  speaking  fully,  making  a  clean  breast  of  it.  From 
parresia  {pan,  rhesis)  (cf.  13:46).  Is  hidden  from  him  {Ian- 
thanein  auton).  Escapes  his  notice.  Infinitive  in  indirect 
discourse  after  peithomai  (I  am  persuaded). 

27.  /  know  that  thou  believest  {oida  hoti  pisteueis).  Paul 
had  "cornered"  Agrippa  by  this  direct  challenge.  As  the 
Jew  in  charge  of  the  temple  he  was  bound  to  confess  his 
faith  in  the  prophets.  But  Paul  had  interpreted  the  prophets 
about  the  Messiah  in  a  way  that  fell  in  with  his  claim  that 
Jesus  was  the  Messiah  risen  from  the  dead.  To  say,  "Yes" 
would  place  himself  in  Paul's  hands.  To  say  "No"  would 
mean  that  he  did  not  believe  the  prophets.  Agrippa  had 
listened  with  the  keenest  interest,  but  he  slipped  out  of  the 
coils  with  adroitness  and  a  touch  of  humour. 

28.  With  but  little  persuasion  thou  wouldest  fain  make  me 
a  Christian  {en  oligoi  me  peitheis  Christianon  poiesai).  The 
Authorized  rendering  is  impossible:  "Almost  thou  per- 
suadest  me  to  be  a  Christian."  En  oligoi  does  not  mean 
"almost."  That  would  require  oligou,  par^  oligon,  or  dei 
oligou.  It  is  not  clear,  however,  precisely  what  en  oligoi  does 
mean.  It  may  refer  to  time  (in  little  time)  or  a  short  cut, 
but  that  does  not  suit  well  en  megaloi  in  verse  29.  Tyndale 
and  Crammer  rendered  it  "somewhat"  (in  small  measure 
or  degree).  There  are,  alas,  many  "somewhat"  Christians. 
Most  likely  the  idea  is  "in  (or  with)  small  effort  you  are  try- 
ing to  persuade  {peitheis,  conative  present  active  indicative) 
me  in  order  to  make  me  a  Christian."  This  takes  the  infini- 
tive poiesai  to  be  purpose  (Page  renders  it  by  "so  as")  and 
thus  avoids  trying  to  make  poiesai  like  genesthai  (become). 


454      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

The  aorist  is  punctiliar  action  for  single  act,  not  "perfect." 
The  tone  of  Agrippa  is  ironical,  but  not  unpleasant.  He 
pushes  it  aside  with  a  shrug  of  the  shoulders.  The  use  of 
"Christian"  is  natural  here  as  in  the  other  two  instances 
(11:26;  I  Peter  4:16). 

29.  /  would  to  God  {euxaimen  an  toi  theoi).  Conclusion  of 
fourth-class  condition  (optative  with  an),  undetermined  with 
less  likelihood,  the  so-called  potential  optative  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  p.  102 1).  Polite  and  courteous  wish  (first  aorist 
middle  optative  of  euchomai).  Whether  with  little  or  with 
much  {kai  en  mikroi  kai  en  megaloi).  Literally,  "both  in 
little  and  in  great,"  or  "both  with  little  and  with  great 
pains"  or  "both  in  some  measure  and  in  great  measure." 
Paul  takes  kindly  the  sarcasm  of  Agrippa.  Such  as  I  am 
(toioutous  hopoios  kai  ego  eimi).  Accusative  toioutous  with 
the  infinitive  genesthai.  Paul  uses  these  two  qualitative 
pronouns  instead  of  repeating  the  word  "Christian."  Ex- 
cept these  bonds  {parekios  ton  desmon  touton).  Ablative  case 
with  parektos  (late  preposition  for  the  old  parek).  Paul  lifts 
his  right  manacled  hand  with  exquisite  grace  and  good  feel- 
ing. 

30.  Rose  up  (aneste).  Second  aorist  active  of  anistemi  (in- 
transitive), agreeing  only  with  "the  king"  {ho  basileus). 
The  entertainment  was  over. 

31.  They  spake  one  to  another  {elaloun  pros  allelous). 
Imperfect  active,  describing  the  eager  conversation  of  the 
dignitaries  about  Paul's  wonderful  speech.  Nothing  worthy 
of  death  or  bonds  {ouden  thanatou  e  desmon  axion).  This  is 
the  unanimous  conclusion  of  all  these  dignitaries  (Romans, 
Jews,  Greeks)  as  it  was  of  Festus  before  (25:25).  But  Paul 
had  not  won  any  of  them  to  Christ.  The  conclusion  leaves 
Festus  in  a  predicament.  Why  had  he  not  set  Paul  free 
before   this.^ 

32.  This  man  might  have  been  set  at  liberty  {Apolelusthai 
edunato  ho  anthrbpos  houtos).   Conclusion  of  the  second  class 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  455 

condition  (detennined  as  unfulfilled)  without  an  as  in  24:19 
because  of  edunato  (verb  of  possibility,  Robertson,  Grammar^ 
p.  1014).  Note  perfect  passive  infinitive  apolelusthai  from 
apoluo.  He  certainly  "could  have  been  set  free."  Why  was 
it  not  done  ?  If  he  had  not  appealed  unto  Caesar  {ei  me  epekek- 
leto  Kaisara).  Condition  of  the  second  class  with  the  past 
perfect  middle  indicative  (pp.  cit.,  p.  1015)  of  epikaleo  (cf. 
25:1  if.).  But  Paul  only  appealed  to  Caesar  after  Festiis  had 
tried  to  shift  him  back  to  Jerusalem  and  had  refused  to  set 
him  free  in  Caesarea.  Festus  comes  out  with  no  honour  in  the 
case.  Since  Agrippa  was  a  favourite  at  court  perhaps  Festus 
would  be  willing  to  write  favourably  to  Caesar. 


CHAPTER  XXVII 

I.  That  we  should  sail  {tou  apoplein  hemds).  This  genitive 
articular  infinitive  with  ekrithe  like  the  LXX  construction 
translating  the  Hebrew  infinitive  construct  is  awkward  in 
Greek.  Several  similar  examples  in  Luke  17:1;  Acts  10:25; 
20:3  (Robertson,  Grammar ^  p.  1068).  Luke  alone  uses  this 
old  verb  in  N.T.  He  uses  nine  compounds  of  pled,  to  sail. 
Note  the  reappearance  of  "we"  in  the  narrative.  It  is 
possible,  of  course,  that  Luke  was  not  with  Paul  during  the 
series  of  trials  at  Caesarea,  or  at  least,  not  all  the  time.  But 
it  is  natural  for  Luke  to  use  "we"  again  because  he  and 
Aristarchus  are  travelling  with  Paul.  In  Caesarea  Paul 
was  the  centre  of  the  action  all  the  time  whether  Luke  was 
present  or  not.  The  great  detail  and  minute  accuracy  of 
Luke's  account  of  this  voyage  and  shipwreck  throw  more 
light  upon  ancient  seafaring  than  everything  else  put  to- 
gether. Smith's  Voyage  and  Shipwreck  of  St.  Paul  is  still 
a  classic  on  the  subject.  Though  so  accurate  in  his  use  of 
sea  terms,  yet  Luke  writes  like  a  landsman,  not  like  a  sailor. 
Besides,  the  character  of  Paul  is  here  revealed  in  a  remark- 
able fashion.  They  delivered  (paredidoun).  Imperfect  active 
omega  form  rather  than  the  old  -mi  form  paredidosan  as  in 
4:33,  from  paradidbmi.  Perhaps  the  imperfect  notes  the  con- 
tinuance of  the  handing  over.  Certain  other  prisoners  (iinas 
heterous  desmbtas).  Bound  {desmbtas)  like  Paul,  but  not 
necessarily  appellants  to  Caesar,  perhaps  some  of  them  con- 
demned criminals  to  amuse  the  Roman  populace  in  the 
gladiatorial  shows,  most  likely  pagans  though  heterous  does 
not  have  to  mean  different  kind  of  prisoners  from  Paul. 
Of  the  Augustan  band  {speires  Sehastes).  Note  Ionic  genitive 
speires,  not  speiras.   See  on  Matt.  27:1;  Acts  10:1.   Cohortis 

456 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  457 

Augustae.  We  do  not  really  know  why  this  cohort  is  called 
"Augustan."  It  may  be  that  it  is  part  of  the  imperial 
commissariat  (frumentarii)  since  Julius  assumes  chief 
authority  in  the  grain  ship  (verse  11).  These  legionary 
centurions  when  in  Rome  were  called  peregrini  (foreigners) 
because  their  work  was  chiefly  in  the  provinces.  This  man 
Julius  may  have  been  one  of  them. 

2.  In  a  ship  of  Adramyttium  (plotoi  Hadramuntenoi).  A 
boat  belonging  to  Adramyttium,  a  city  in  Mysia  in  the 
province  of  Asia.  Probably  a  small  coasting  vessel  on  its 
way  home  for  the  winter  stopping  at  various  places  (topous). 
Julius  would  take  his  chances  to  catch  another  ship  for 
Rome.  The  usual  way  to  go  to  Rome  was  to  go  to  Alexan- 
dria and  so  to  Rome,  but  no  large  ship  for  Alexandria  was 
at  hand.  JVe  put  to  sea  (anechthemen) .  First  aorist  passive 
of  anago,  usual  word  in  Luke.  Aristarchus,  a  Macedonian  oj 
Thessalonica,  being  with  us  {ontos  sun  hemin  Aristarchou 
Makedonos  Thessalonikeos).  Genitive  absolute.  Ramsay 
suggests  that  Luke  and  Aristarchus  accompanied  Paul  as 
his  slaves  since  they  would  not  be  allowed  to  go  as  his 
friends.  But  Luke  was  Paul's  physician  and  may  have 
gained  permission  on  that  score. 

3.  The  next  day  {tei  heterdi).  Locative  case  with  hemerdi 
understood.  We  touched  ikatechthemen).  First  aorist  passive 
of  katago,  the  usual  term  for  "coming  down"  from  the  seas 
as  anago  above  (and  verse  4)  is  for  "going  up"  to  sea.  So  it 
looks  to  sailors.  Sidon  was  67  miles  from  Caesarea,  the  rival 
of  Tyre,  with  a  splendid  harbour.  The  ship  stopped  here  for 
trade.  Treated  Paul  kindly  {philanthropos  toi  Pauloi  chresa- 
menos).  "Using  {chresamenos,  first  aorist  middle  participle 
of  chraomaij  to  use)  Paul  (instrumental  case  used  with  this 
verb)  kindly"  {philanthropos ^  "philanthropically,"  adverb 
from  phil-anthropos,  love  of  mankind).  He  was  kindly  to 
Paul  throughout  the  voyage  (verse  43;  28:16),  taking  a 
personal  interest  in  his  welfare.    Refresh  himself  {epimeleias 


4S8      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

tuchein).  Second  aorist  active  infinitive  of  tugchano  (to 
obtain)  with  the  genitive  epimeleias,  old  word  from  epimeleSy 
careful,  only  here  in  the  N.T.  Whether  it  was  mere  hospital- 
ity we  do  not  know.  It  may  have  been  medical  attention  re- 
quired because  of  Paul's  long  confinement.  This  is  Paul's 
first  visit  to  Sidon,  but  Christians  were  already  in  Phoenicia 
(11:19)  and  so  Paul  had  "friends"  here. 

4.  We  sailed  under  the  lee  of  Cyprus  {hup epleus amen  ten 
Kupron).  First  aorist  active  indicative  of  hupopleo,  to  sail 
under,  Cyprus  was  thus  on  the  left  between  the  ship  and 
the  wind  from  the  northwest,  under  the  protection  of  Cyprus. 
Because  the  winds  were  contrary  idia  to  tous  anemous  einai 
enantious).  The  articular  infinitive  after  dia  and  the  accusa- 
tive of  general  reference  {anemous)  with  predicate  accusa- 
tive {enantious,  facing  them,  in  their  very  teeth  if  they  went 
that  way).  The  Etesian  winds  were  blowing  from  the' north- 
west so  that  they  could  not  cut  straight  across  from  Sidon  to 
Patara  with  Cyprus  on  the  right.  They  must  run  behind 
Cyprus  and  hug  the  shore  of  Cilicia  and  Pamphylia. 

5.  When  we  had  sailed  across  {diapleus antes).  First  aorist 
active  participle  of  diapleo  (another  compound  of  pled). 
The  sea  which  is  off  Cilicia  and  Pamphylia  {to  pelagos  to  kata 
ten  Kilikian  kai  Pamphulian).  Pelagos  is  properly  the  high 
sea  as  here.  In  Matt.  18:6  (which  see)  Jesus  uses  it  of  "the 
depth  of  the  sea."  Only  these  examples  in  the  N.T.  The 
current  runs  westward  along  the  coast  of  Cilicia  and  Pam- 
phylia and  the  land  would  protect  from  the  wind.  We  came 
to  Myra  of  Lycia  {katelthamen  eis  Murra  tes  Lukias).  Liter- 
ally, "We  came  down."  This  town  was  two  and  a  half 
miles  from  the  coast  of  Lycia.  The  port  Andriace  had  a  fine 
harbour  and  did  a  large  grain  business.  No  disciples  are 
mentioned  here  nor  at  Lasea,  Melita,  Syracuse,  Rhegium. 

6.  Sailing  for  Italy  {pleon  eis  ten  Italian).  This  was  the 
opportunity  for  which  Lysias  had  been  looking.  So  he  put 
{enehihasen,  first  aorist  active  of  emhihazo,  to  cause  to  enter. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  459 

Cf.  epibantes  in  verse  2)  prisoners  and  soldiers  on  board. 
This  was  a  ship  of  Alexandria  bound  for  Rome,  a  grain 
ship  (38)  out  of  its  course  because  of  the  wind.  Such  grain 
ships  usually  carried  passengers. 

7.  When  we  had  sailed  slowly  (braduploountes) .  Present 
active  participle  of  hraduploeo  (bradusy  slow,  pious ,  voyage). 
Literally,  "sailing  slowly,"  not  "having  or  had  sailed 
slowly."  Only  here  and  in  Artemidorus  (sec.  cent.  a.d.). 
It  may  mean  "tacking"  before  the  wind.  Polybius  uses 
tachuploeo,  to  sail  swiftly.  Many  days  {en  hikanais  hemerais). 
See  on  Luke  7:6  for  hikanos.  Literally,  "in  considerable 
days."  With  difficulty  {molis).  Used  in  old  Greek,  like  mogis 
(Luke  9:39)  from  moloSj  toil  (see  Acts  14:18).  Over  against 
Cnidus  (kata  ten  Knidon).  "Down  along  Cnidus."  A 
hundred  and  thirty  miles  from  Myra,  the  southwest  point 
of  Asia  Minor  and  the  western  coast.  Here  the  protection 
of  the  land  from  the  northwest  wind  ceased.  The  wind  not 
further  suffering  us  {me  prose ontos  hemds  tou  anemou). 
Genitive  absolute  with  present  active  participle  of  proseao, 
one  of  the  few  words  still  "not  found  elsewhere"  (Thayer). 
Regular  negative  me  with  participles.  They  could  not  go  on 
west  as  they  had  been  doing  since  leaving  Myra,  We  sailed 
under  the  lee  of  Crete  {hupepleusamen  ten  Kreten).  See  under 
verse  4.  Instead  of  going  to  the  right  of  Crete  as  the  straight 
course  would  have  been  they  sailed  southwest  with  Crete 
to  their  right  and  got  some  protection  against  the  wind  there. 
Over  against  Salmone  {kata  Salmonen).  Off  Cape  Sal- 
mone,  a  promontory  on  the  east  of  the  island. 

8.  Coasting  along  {paralegomenot).  Present  middle  par- 
ticiple of  par  ale  go  y  to  lay  beside,  not  from  lego,  to  collect  or 
lego,  to  say.  Diodorus  Siculus  uses  paralegomai  in  precisely 
this  sense  of  coasting  along,  like  Latin  legere  oram.  In  N.T. 
only  here  and  verse  13.  Fair  Havens  {Kalous  Limenas). 
This  harbour  is  named  Kalus  Limeonas,  a  small  bay  two 
miles  east  of  Cape  Matala.   It  opens  to  the  East  and  South-

east,  but  is  not  fit  to  winter  in.  This  harbour  would  protect 
them  for  a  time  from  the  winds.  The  city  of  Lasea  {polis 
Lasea).  Neither  Lasea  nor  Fair  Havens  is  mentioned  by 
any  ancient  writer,  two  of  the  hundred  cities  of  Crete. 

9.  Where  much  time  was  spent  {Hikanou  chronou  diageno- 
menou).  Genitive  absolute  again  with  second  aorist  middle 
participle  of  diaginomai,  to  come  in  between  (dia).  "Con- 
siderable time  intervening,"  since  they  became  weather- 
bound in  this  harbour,  though  some  take  it  since  they  left 
Caesarea.  ^nd  the  voyage  was  now  dangerous  (kai  onios  ede 
episphalous).  Genitive  absolute,  "and  the  voyage  being 
already  (^J?  =  Latin  jam)  dangerous"  (old  word  from  epi 
and  sphalloj  to  trip,  to  fall,  and  so  prone  to  fall,  here  only  in 
N.T.).  Because  the  Fast  was  now  already  gone  by  [dia  to  kai 
ten  nesteian  ede  pareleluthenai) .  Accusative  (after  dia) 
of  the  articular  infinitive  perfect  active  of  parerchomaiy  to 
pass  by,  with  the  accusative  of  general  reference  {nesteian, 
the  great  day  of  atonement  of  the  Jews,  Lev.  16:29!!".) 
occurring  about  the  end  of  September.  The  ancients  con- 
sidered navigation  on  the  Mediterranean  unsafe  from  early 
October  till  the  middle  of  March.  In  a.d.  59  the  Fast  oc- 
curred on  Oct.  5.  There  is  nothing  strange  in  Luke  using  this 
Jewish  note  of  time  as  in  20:6  though  a  Gentile  Christian. 
Paul  did  it  also  (I  Cor.  16:8).  It  is  no  proof  that  Luke  was 
a  Jewish  proselyte.  We  do  not  know  precisely  when  the  party 
left  Caesarea  (possibly  in  August),  but  in  ample  time  to 
arrive  in  Rome  before  October  if  conditions  had  been  more 
favourable.  But  the  contrary  winds  had  made  the  voyage 
very  slow  and  difficult  all  the  way  (verse  7)  besides  the  long 
delay  here  in  this  harbour  of  Fair  Havens.  Paul  admonished 
them  {pareinei  ho  Paulos).  Imperfect  active  of  paraineo,  old 
word  to  exhort  from  para  and  aineo,  to  praise  (3:8),  only 
here  and  verse  22  in  N.T.  It  is  remarkable  that  a  prisoner 
like  Paul  should  venture  to  give  advice  at  all  and  to  keep 
on  doing  it  (imperfect  tense  inchoative,  began  to  admonish 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  461 

and  kept  on  at  it).  Paul  had  clearly  won  the  respect  of  the 
centurion  and  officers  and  also  felt  it  to  be  his  duty  to  give 
this  unasked  for  warning.  /  perceive  {the or 0).  Old  word 
from  theoros,  a  spectator.  See  Luke  10:18.  Paul  does  not 
here  claim  prophecy,  but  he  had  plenty  of  experience  with 
three  shipwrecks  already  (II  Cor.  11 :25)  to  justify  his  appre- 
hension. Will  be  (mellein  esesthai).  Infinitive  in  indirect 
assertion  followed  by  future  infinitive  after  mellein  in  spite 
of  hoti  which  would  naturally  call  for  present  indicative 
mellei,  an  anacoluthon  due  to  the  long  sentence  (Robertson, 
Grammar  J  p.  438).  With  injury  {meta  hubreos).  An  old  word 
from  huper  (above,  upper,  like  our  "uppishness")  and  so 
pride,  insult,  personal  injury,  the  legal  word  for  personal 
assault  (Page).  Josephus  (Jnt.  III.  6,  4)  uses  it  of  the  injury 
of  the  elements.  Loss  (zemian).  Old  word,  opposite  of 
kerdosy  gain  or  profit  (Phil,  jryf.)*  Nowhere  else  in  N.T. 
Lading  {phortiou).  Diminutive  of  phortos  (from  phero,  to 
bear)  only  in  form.  Common  word,  but  in  N.T.  only  here  in 
literal  sense,  as  metaphor  in  Matt.  11:30;  23:4;  Luke  11:46; 
Gdl.  6:5.  But  also  of  our  lives  {alia  kai  ton  psuchon).  Common 
use  of  psuche  for  life,  originally  "breath  of  life"  (Acts  20:10), 
and  also  "soul"  (14:2).  Fortunately  no  lives  were  lost, 
though  all  else  was.  But  this  outcome  was  due  to  the  special 
mercy  of  God  for  the  sake  of  Paul  (verse  24),  not  to  the 
wisdom  of  the  officers  in  rejecting  Paul's  advice.  Paul 
begins  now  to  occupy  the  leading  role  in  this  marvellous 
voyage. 

II.  Gave  more  heed  {mdllon  epeitheto).  Imperfect  middle 
of  peithOf  to  yield  to  (with  the  dative  case).  The  "Frumen- 
tarian"  centurion  ranked  above  the  captain  and  owner. 
As  a  military  officer  the  centurion  was  responsible  for  the 
soldiers,  the  prisoners,  and  the  cargo  of  wheat.  It  was  a 
government  ship.  Though  the  season  was  not  advanced, 
the  centurion  probably  feared  to  risk  criticism  in  Rome  for 
timidity  when  the  wheat  was  so  much  needed  in  Rome 


462      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

(Knowling).  To  the  master  {toi  kubernetei) .  Old  word  from 
kubernao,  to  steer,  and  so  steersman,  pilot,  sailing-master. 
Common  in  this  sense  in  the  papyri.  In  N.T.  only  here  and 
Rev.  18:17.  And  to  the  owner  of  the  ship  {kai  toi  naukleroi). 
Old  word  compounded  of  naus  and  kleros  and  used  for  owner 
of  the  ship  who  acted  as  his  own  skipper  or  captain.  The 
papyri  examples  (Moulton  and  Milligan's  Vocabulary)  all 
have  the  meaning  "captain"  rather  than  "owner." 

12.  Because  the  haven  was  not  commodious  to  winter  in 
{aneuthetou  tou  limenos  huparchontos  pros  paracheimasian). 
Genitive  absolute  again  present  tense  of  huparcho:  "The 
harbour  being  unfit  {aneuthetou,  this  compound  not  yet 
found  elsewhere,  simplex  in  Luke  9:62;  14:35;  Heb.  6:7)  for 
wintering"  (paracheimasia,  only  here  in  N.T.,  but  in  Po- 
lybius  and  Diodorus,  in  an  inscription  a.d.  48,  from  parachei- 
mazo).  The  more  part  advised  (hoi  pleiones  ethento  boulen). 
Second  aorist  middle  indicative  of  tithemi,  ancient  idiom  with 
boulen,  to  take  counsel,  give  counsel.  Lysias  held  a  council 
of  the  officers  of  the  ship  on  the  issue  raised  by  Paul.  //  by 
any  means  they  could  reach  Phoenix  and  winter  there  [ei  pds 
dunainto  katantesantes  eis  Phoinika  paracheimasai).  The 
optative  dunainto  (present  middle  of  dunamai)  here  with 
ei  is  a  condition  of  the  fourth  class  with  the  notion  of  pur- 
pose implied  and  indirect  discourse  (Robertson,  Grammar^ 
p.  1021).  "We  vote  for  going  on  the  chance  that  we  may 
be  able"  (Page).  Phoenix  is  the  town  of  palms  (John  12:13), 
the  modern  Lutro,  the  only  town  in  Crete  on  the  southern 
coast  with  a  harbour  fit  for  wintering,  though  Wordsworth 
and  Page  argue  for  Phineka  which  suits  Luke's  description 
better.  The  verb  paracheimazo ,  to  winter,  is  from  para  and 
cheimon  (see  also  28:11).  Used  in  several  KoinS  writers. 
Looking  northeast  and  southeast  (bleponta  kata  liba  kai  kata 
choron).  There  are  two  ways  of  interpreting  this  language. 
Lips  means  the  southwest  wind  and  choros  the  northwest 
wind.   But  what  is  the  effect  of  )^fl^<3  with  these  words?  Does 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  463 

it  mean  "facing"  the  wind?  If  so,  we  must  read  "looking 
southwest  and  northwest."  But  kata  can  mean  down  the 
line  of  the  wind  (the  way  the  wind  is  blowing).  If  so,  then 
it  is  proper  to  translate  "looking  northeast  and  southeast." 
This  translation  suits  Lutro,  the  other  suits  Phoenike.  Ram- 
say takes  it  to  be  Lutro,  and  suggests  that  sailors  describe 
the  harbour  by  the  way  it  looks  as  they  go  into  it  (the  sub- 
jectivity of  the  sailors)  and  that  Luke  so  speaks  and  means 
Lutro  which  faces  northeast  and  southeast.  On  the  whole 
Lutro  has  the  best  of  the  argument. 

13.  When  the  south  wind  blew  softly  {hupopneusantos  notou). 
Genitive  absolute  with  aorist  active  participle  of  hupopneo, 
old  verb  to  blow  under,  then  to  blow  gently,  here  only  in 
N.T.  "A  south  wind  having  blown  gently,"  in  marked  con- 
trast to  the  violent  northwest  wind  that  they  had  faced  so 
long.  They  were  so  sure  of  the  wisdom  of  their  decision 
that  they  did  not  even  draw  up  the  small  boat  attached  by 
a  rope  to  the  vessel's  stern  (verse  16).  It  was  only  some  forty 
miles  to  Lutro.  Their  purpose  {tes  protheseos,  set  before  them, 
from  protithemi) ,  genitive  after  krated  (kekratekenai,  perfect 
active  infinitive  in  indirect  discourse).  They  weighed  anchor 
{arantes)'.  First  aorist  active  participle  of  airOy  old  verb 
used  in  technical  sense  with  tas  agkuras  (anchors)  under- 
stood as  in  Thucydides  I.  52;  II.  23,  "having  lifted  the  an- 
chors." Page  takes  it  simply  as  "moving."  Sailed  along 
Crete  {parelegonto  ten  Kreten).  Imperfect  middle.  See 
verse  8,  "were  coasting  along  Crete."  Close  in  shore  (dsson). 
Comparative  adverb  of  agki^  near,  and  so  "nearer"  to  shore. 
Only  here  in  N.T. 

14.  Jfter  no  long  time  (mef  ou  polu).  Litotes  again.  Beat 
dotvnfrom  it  {ehalen  kat^  autes).  Second  aorist  active  indica- 
tive of  balloy  to  throw.  Here  "dashed"  (intransitive).  Autes 
is  in  the  ablative,  not  genitive  case,  beat  "down  from  it" 
(Crete),  not  "against  it  or  on  it."  (Robertson,  Grammar ^ 
p.  606).    Auies  cannot  refer  to  ploion  (boat)  which  is  neuter. 


464      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

So  the  ablative  case  with  kaia  as  in  Mark  5:13,  Homer  also. 
The  Cretan  mountains  are  over  7,000  feet  high.  A  tempestu- 
ous wind  which  is  called  Euraquilo  {anemos  tuphonikos  ho 
kaloumenos  Eurakulon).  Tuphon  =  Tuphos  was  used  for  the 
typhoon,  a  violent  whirlwind  (turbo)  or  squall.  This  word 
gives  the  character  of  the  wind.  The  Eurakulon  (reading 
of  Aleph  A  B  against  the  Textus  Receptus  Eurokludbn)  has 
not  been  found  elsewhere.  Blass  calls  it  a  hybrid  word  com- 
pounded of  the  Greek  euros  (east  wind)  and  the  Latin 
aquilo  (northeast).  It  is  made  like  euronotos  (southeast). 
The  Vulgate  has  euroaquilo.  It  is  thus  the  east  north  east 
wind.  Page  considers  Euroclydon  to  be  a  corruption  of 
Euraquilo.  Here  the  name  gives  the  direction  of  the 
wind. 

15.  When  the  ship  was  caught  (sunarpasthentos  tou  ploiou). 
Genitive  absolute  again  with  first  aorist  passive  of  sunar- 
pazOf  old  word,  in  N.T.  only  Luke  8:29;  Acts  6:12;  19:29, 
and  here.  Graphic  picture  as  if  the  ship  was  seized  by  a 
great  monster.  Face  the  wind  (antophthalmein  toi  anemoi). 
Dative  case  with  the  vivid  infimtive  of  antophthalmedirom  an- 
tophthalmos,  looking  in  the  eye,  or  eye  to  eye  (anti,  facing  and 
opthalmos,  eye).  Eyes  were  painted  on  the  prows  of  vessels. 
The  ship  could  not  face  the  wind  enough  to  get  to  Phoenix. 
Modern  sailors  talk  of  sailing  into  the  eye  of  the  wind.  We 
were  not  able  to  look  the  wind  in  the  eye.  KoinS  verb  used 
by  Polybius.  SomeMSS.  have  it  in  Acts  6:11,  but  only  here 
in  N.T.  In  Wisdom  of  Sol.  12:14  i^  is  used  of  a  prince  who 
cannot  look  God  in  the  face.  Clement  of  Rome  34  uses  it 
of  an  idle  workman  not  able  to  look  his  employer  in  the  face 
(Milligan  andMoulton's  Vocabulary).  We  gave  way  (epidon- 
tes).  Second  aorist  active  participle  of  epididomi,  giving  way 
to  the  wind.  Were  driven  (epherometha).  Imperfect  passive 
oi  phero,  "we  were  being  borne  along."  We  "scudded  be- 
fore the  gale"  (Page).  "The  suddenness  of  the  hurricane 
gave  no  time  to  furl  the  great  mainsail"  (Furneaux).

16.  Running  under  the  lee  of  (hupodramontes).  Second 
aorist  active  participle  of  hupotrecho.  Same  use  of  hupo  as  in 
hupepleusamen  (verses  4,  8)  for  "under  the  lee",  under  the 
protection  of.  Nesion  is  diminutive  of  nesos,  a  small  island* 
The  MSS.  vary  between  Cauda  (B)  and  Clauda  (Aleph). 
To  secure  the  hoot  (perikrateis  genesthai  tes  skaphes).  "To 
become  masters  {perikrateis  from  peri  and  kratos,  power 
over,  found  in  Susannah  and  ecclesiastical  writers,  and  here 
only  in  N.T.)  of  the  boat  ("dug  out,"  like  Indian  boats, 
literally,  from  skapto,  to  dig,  old  word,  here  only  in  N.T.  and 
verses  30,  32).  The  smooth  water  behind  the  little  island 
enabled  them  to  do  this.  When  they  had  hoisted  it  up  {hen 
drantes).  "  Which  (the  little  boat)  having  hoisted  up  {ar antes, 
verse  13)."  Even  so  it  was  "with  difficulty"  {molis).  Per- 
haps the  little  boat  was  waterlogged.  Used  helps  {boetheiais 
echronto).  Imperfect  middle  of  chraomai  with  instrumental 
case.  The  "helps"  were  ropes  or  chains,  no  doubt.  Under- 
girding  the  ship  {hupozonnuntes  to  ploion).  Present  active 
participle  of  hupozbnnumi.  Old  verb,  here  only  in  N.T. 
Probably  cables  {hupozomata)  or  ropes  were  used  under  the 
hull  of  the  ship  laterally  or  even  longitudinally,  tightly  se- 
cured on  deck.  This  "frapping"  was  more  necessary  for 
ancient  vessels  because  of  the  heavy  mast.  The  little  island 
made  it  possible  to  do  this  also.  Lest  we  be  cast  upon  the 
Syrtis  {me  eis  ten  Surtin  ekpesosin).  Final  clause  after  verb 
of  fearing  {phoboumenoi)  with  me  and  the  second  aorist  active 
subjunctive  of  ekpipto,  old  verb  to  fall  out  or  off,  to  be  cast 
away.  So  here  and  verses  26,  29,  a  classical  use  of  the  verb 
for  a  ship  driven  out  of  its  course  on  to  shoals  or  rocks  (Page 
who  cites  Xenophon,  Anab.  VII.  5,  12).  The  Syrtis  was  the 
name  for  two  quicksands  between  Carthage  and  Cyrenaica, 
this  clearly  being  the  Syrtis  Major  most  dangerous  because 
of  the  sandbanks  {surtis,  from  suro).  The  wind  would  drive 
the  ship  right  into  this  peril  if  something  were  not  done. 
They  lowered  the  gear  {chalasantes  to  skeuos).     First  aorist 


466     WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

active  participle  of  ckalao  (cf.  Luke  5:4  for  lowering  the 
nets).  Skeuos  means  vessel  or  gear.  They  slackened  or  re- 
duced sail,  especially  the  mainsail,  but  leaving  enough  to 
keep  the  ship's  head  as  close  to  the  wind  as  was  practicable. 
So  were  driven  {houtos  epheronto).  Imperfect  passive  indica- 
tive again  as  in  verse  15  with  the  addition  of  houtos  (thus). 
The  ship  was  now  fixed  as  near  to  the  wind  (E  N  E)  as 
possible  (seven  points).  That  would  enable  the  ship  to  go 
actually  W  by  N  and  so  avoid  the  quicksands.  J.  Smith  has 
shown  that,  a  day  being  lost  around  Cauda,  the  ship  going 
36  miles  in  24  hours  in  13  days  would  make  468  miles.  The 
Island  of  Malta  (Melita)  is  precisely  in  that  direction  (W  by 
N)  from  Cauda  and  is  480  miles.  Page  sees  a  difficulty  about 
this  explanation  of  the  steady  drift  of  the  ship  in  the  word 
diapheromenon  in  verse  27,  but  that  was  at  the  end  of  the 
drifting  and  the  varied  winds  could  have  come  then  and  not 
before.  The  whole  narrative  as  explained  carefully  in  Smith's 
Voyage  and  Skipzvreck  of  St.  Paul  is  a  masterpiece  of  precise 
and  accurate  scholarship.  A  resume  of  his  results  appears 
in  my  Luke  the  Historian  in  the  Light  of  Research. 

18.  As  we  laboured  exceedingly  with  the  storm  (sphodros  chei- 
mazomenon  hemon).  Genitive  absolute  with  present  passive 
participle  of  cheimazo,  old  verb  to  afilict  with  a  tempest 
{cheima,  stormy  weather),  to  toss  upon  the  waves,  here  alone 
in  N.T.  They  began  to  throw  overboard  (ekbalen  epoiounto). 
Literally,  "They  began  to  make  (inchoative  imperfect 
middle  of  poieo)  a  casting  out"  {ekbolen  from  ekballo,  to  cast 
out,  old  word,  only  here  in  N.T.).  Cf.  Latin  jacturam  facere. 
This  to  lighten  the  ship  by  throwing  overboard  the  cargo. 
The  grain  in  the  ship  would  shift  and  make  it  list  and  so 
added  to  the  danger.  They  cast  out  (eripsan).  Third  person 
plural  aorist  active  of  ripto,  not  eripsamen  as  Textus  Recepr 
tus.  With  their  own  hands  (autocheires).  Old  word  {autoSy 
cheir)  but  here  alone  in  N.T.  Vivid  and  graphic  touch  by 
Luke  who,  of  course,  watched  every  movement  day  by  day.

Thf  tackling  (ten  skeuen).     The  furniture  of  the  ship  that 
could  be  spared.    It  was  becoming  desperate. 

20.  When  neither  sun  nor  stars  shone  upon  us  {mete  heliou 
mete  astron  epiphainonton).  Genitive  absolute  again.  For 
many  days  {epi  pleionas  hemeras).  For  more  days  than  a  few. 
No  small  tempest  {cheimonos  ouk  oligou).  Litotes  again.  All 
hope  that  we  should  he  saved  was  now  taken  away  {loipon 
perieireito  elpis  pdsa  tou  sozesthai  hemds).  "For  the  rest 
(or  future)  there  began  to  be  taken  from  around  us  {periei- 
reito inchoative  imperfect  and  see  use  of  the  verb  in  II  Cor. 
13  :i6  of  the  veil)  all  hope  of  the  being  saved  so  far  as  we  were 
concerned."  Despair  was  beginning  to  settle  like  a  fog  on  all 
their  hopes.    Had  Paul  lost  hope.'' 

21.  When  they  had  been  long  without  food  {polles  te  asitias 
hupar chouses).  Genitive  absolute,  the  old  word  asitia  from 
asitos  (verse  33)  a  privative  and  sitos^  food,  here  alone  in  N.T. 
Literally,  "There  being  much  abstinence  from  food."  They 
had  plenty  of  grain  on  board,  but  no  appetite  to  eat  (sea- 
sickness) and  no  fires  to  cook  it  (Page).  "Little  heart  being 
left  for  food"  (Randall).  Galen  and  other  medical  writers 
use  asitia  and  asitos  for  want  of  appetite.  Stood  forth  {sta- 
theis).  As  in  1:15;  2:14;  17:22.  Pictorial  word  (Page)  that 
sets  forth  the  vividness  and  solemnity  of  the  scene  (Knowl- 
ing).  Ye  should  have  hearkened  unto  me  {edei  men  peitharche- 
santas  moi).  Literally,  "It  was  necessary  for  you  hearkening 
unto  me  not  to  set  sail  {me  anagesthai)^  It  was  not  the 
"I  told  you  so"  of  a  small  nature,  "but  a  reference  to  the 
wisdom  of  his  former  counsel  in  order  to  induce  acceptance 
of  his  present  advice"  (Furneaux).  The  first  aorist  active 
participle  is  in  the  accusative  of  general  reference  with  the 
present  infinitive  anagesthai.  And  have  gotten  this  injury 
and  loss  {kerdesai  te  ten  huhrin  tauten  kai  ten  zemian).  This

kerddnai  is  common  in  late  Greek  (Robertson,  Grammar^ 
p.  349).  The  Revised  Version  thus  carries  over  the  negative

me  to  this  first  aorist  active  infinitive  kerdesai  from  kerdao 
(cf.  on  Matt.  16:26).  But  Page  follows  Thayer  in  urging  that 
this  is  not  exact,  that  Paul  means  that  by  taking  his  advice 
they  ought  to  have  escaped  this  injury  and  loss.  "A  person 
is  said  in  Greek  *to  gain  a  loss*  when,  being  in  danger  of 
incurring  it,  he  by  his  conduct  saves  himself  from  doing  so." 
This  is  probably  Paul's  idea  here. 

22.  And  now  {kai  ta  nun).  Accusative  plural  neuter 
article  of  general  reference  in  contrast  with  men  in  verse  21. 
Paul  shows  modesty  (Bengel)  in  the  mild  contrast.  No  loss 
of  life  {apobole  psuches  oudemia).  Old  word  from  apoballo,  to 
throw  away,  only  twice  in  N.T.  Romans  11:15  (rejection) 
and  here.  He  had  foretold  such  loss  of  life  as  likely  (verse 
10),  but  he  now  gives  his  reason  for  his  changed  view. 

23.  For  there  stood  by  me  {pareste  gar  mot).  Second  aorist 
active  (intransitive)  indicative  of  paristemi  with  the  locative 
case  (beside  me).  The  very  form  used  by  Paul  of  his  trial 
(II  Tim.  4:17)  when  "the  Lord  stood  by  me"  {ho  de  kurios 
moi  pareste)  when  others  deserted  him.  This  angel  of  the 
God  whom  Paul  serves  (in  distinction  from  the  heathen  gods) 
is  the  reason  for  Paul's  present  confidence. 

24.  Thou  must  stand  before  Caesar  {Kaisari  se  dei  paraS' 
tenai).  Note  the  same  dei  (must)  as  in  23:11  when  Jesus 
appeared  to  Paul  in  Jerusalem  and  the  same  verb  parastenai 
(second  aorist  active  infinitive)  used  in  verse  23.  Hatk 
granted  thee  {kecharistai  soi).  Perfect  middle  indicative  of 
charizomai  and  that  from  charis,  a  gift  or  grace.  The  lives 
of  those  that  sailed  with  Paul  God  had  spared  as  a  gift 
(char is)  to  Paul. 

25.  fP^herefore  be  of  good  cheer  (dio  euthumeite).  God  had 
spoken.  That  was  enough.  This  old  verb  from  euthumos  in 
the  N.T.  only  here,  verse  25,  and  James  5:13.  See  the  adjec- 
tive 27:36.  For  I  believe  God  (pisteuo  gar  toi  theoi).  This  is 
Paul's  reason  for  his  own  good  cheer  and  for  his  exhortation 
to  confidence  in  spite  of  circumstances  so  untoward.    Paul 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  469 

had  doubtless  prayed  for  his  own  life  and  for  the  lives  of  all. 
He  was  sure  that  he  was  to  bear  his  witness  in  Rome. 

26.  We  must  be  cast  {dei  hemds  ekpesein).  It  is  necessary 
for  us  to  fall  out  {ekpesein,  second  aorist  active  infinitive  of 
ekpipto).  It  was  not  revealed  to  Paul  what  island  it  would 
be. 

27.  As  we  were  driven  to  and  fro  (diapheromenon  hemon). 
Genitive  absolute  with  present  passive  participle  of  diaphero, 
old  verb  to  bear  different  ways  {dia  =  duo,  two),  this  way 
and  that.  Continued  to  be  tossed  to  and  fro  in  the  rough 
seas.  It  would  seem  so  to  those  on  board.  It  does  not  neces- 
sarily mean  that  the  wind  had  changed.  The  fourteenth 
night  is  reckoned  from  the  time  they  left  Fair  Havens.  In 
the  sea  of  Adria  {en  toi  Hadridi).  Not  the  Adriatic  Sea  as  we 
now  call  the  sea  between  Italy  and  the  mainland  of  Illyricum, 
but  all  the  lower  Mediterranean  between  Italy  and  Greece. 
Luke's  usage  is  Hke  that  of  Strabo.  Surmised  {hupenooun). 
Imperfect  active  indicative  of  huponoed,  inchoative,  began 
to  suspect.  That  they  were  drawing  near  to  some  country 
{prosagein  tina  autois  choran).  Infinitive  with  accusative 
of  general  reference  in  indirect  assertion.  Prosago  is  here 
used  intransitively  and  Luke  writes  from  the  sailor's  stand- 
point that  a  certain  land  was  drawing  near  to  them  {autois, 
dative).  The  sailors  heard  the  sound  of  breakers  and  grew 
uneasy. 

28.  They  sounded  {bolisantes).  First  aorist  active  participle 
of  holizo  rare  verb  only  here  and  in  Eustathius  who  says  it 
was  familiar  in  ancient  Greek.  Apparently  from  holis,  a  mis- 
sile or  dart,  and  so  to  throw  down  the  lead  into  the  sea,  to 
heave  the  lead,  to  take  soundings.  The  inscriptions  give 
^o/i  wo  J- for ''leaden. "  Twenty  fathoms  {or  guias  eikosi).  This 
old  word,  from  orego,  to  stretch,  means  the  distance  from 
one  outstretched  middle  finger  tip  to  the  other  likewise  out- 
stretched. After  a  little  space  {brachu  diastes antes).  Literally, 
"standing  apart  a  little"  (second  aorist  active  participle  of 


470      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

diistemt),  that  is,  the  ship  going  a  short  distance  further  on. 
A  ship  today  approaching  St.  Paul's  Bay  by  the  rocky  point 
of  Koura  would  pass  first  twenty,  then  fifteen  fathoms 
(Furneaux). 

29.  Lest  haply  we  should  be  cast  ashore  on  rocky  ground  {me 
pou  kata  tracheis  topous  ekpesbmen).  The  usual  construction 
after  a  verb  of  fearing  {me  and  the  aorist  subjunctive  ekpeso- 
men).  Literally,  "Lest  somewhere  {pov)  we  should  fall  out 
down  against  {kata)  rocky  places."  The  change  in  the  sound- 
ings made  it  a  very  real  fear.  Tracheis  (rough)  is  old  adjec- 
tive, but  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  3 :5  (from  Isa.  40:4). 
Four  anchors  {agkuras  tessaras).  Old  word  from  agke.  In 
N.T.  only  in  this  chapter,  with  rhipto  here,  with  ekteino  in 
verse  30,  with  periaireo  in  verse  40;  and  Heb.  6:19  (figura- 
tively of  hope).  From  the  stern  {ek  prumnes).  Old  word, 
but  in  N.T.  only  in  Mark  4:38;  here  and  41  in  contrast  with 
prbira  (prow).  The  usual  practice  was  and  is  to  anchor  by 
the  bows.  "With  a  view  to  running  the  ship  ashore  anchor- 
ing from  the  stern  would,  it  is  said,  be  best"  (Page).  Nelson 
is  quoted  as  saying  that  he  had  been  reading  Acts  27  the 
morning  of  the  Battle  of  Copenhagen  (April,  1801)  where 
he  anchored  his  ships  from  the  stern.  Wished  for  the  day 
{euchonto).  Imperfect  middle,  kept  on  praying  for  "day  to 
come"  {hemeran  genesthai)  before  the  anchors  broke  under 
the  strain  of  the  storm  or  began  to  drag.  If  the  ship  had  been 
anchored  from  the  prow,  it  would  have  swung  round  and 
snapped  the  anchors  or  the  stem  would  have  faced  the 
beach. 

30.  The  sailors  {ton  nautbn).  Old  word  from  naus  (ship), 
in  N.T.  only  here,  verse  30,  and  Rev.  18:17.  ^^^^  seeking 
{zetounton).  Genitive  absolute  again  with  present  active 
participle  of  zeteo  to  seek.  Had  lowered  {chalasanton). 
Aorist  active  participle  of  chalazo.  Under  colour  {prophasei). 
Possibly  the  same  word  as  "prophecy"  (from  pro-phemi,  to 
speak  forth),  but  here  pretence,  pretext,  although  it  may 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  471 

come  from  propkainOj  to  show  forth.  The  use  here  is  an  old 
one  and  appears  also  in  Mark  12:40;  Luke  20:47;  I  Thess. 
2:5;  Phil.  1:18.  As  though  (hos).  The  alleged  reason,  a  com- 
mon Greek  idiom  with  hos  and  the  participle  (Robertson, 
Grammar  J  p.  966).  Here  with  mellonton.  From  the  fore  ship 
{ek  proires).  Old  word  for  prow  of  the  ship.  In  the  N.T. 
only  here  and  verse  41.  Note  here  ekteinein  (lay  out,  stretch 
out)  rather  than  rhipsantes  (casting)  in  verse  29,  for  they 
pretended  to  need  the  small  boat  to  stretch  out  or  lay  out 
the  anchors  in  front. 

31.  Except  these  abide  in  the  ship  {Ban  me  houtoi  meinosin 
en  toi  ploioi).  Condition  of  the  third  class  (undetermined, 
but  with  hope,  etc.).  Paul  has  no  hesitancy  in  saying  this 
in  spite  of  his  strong  language  in  verse  24  about  God's 
promise.  He  has  no  notion  of  lying  supinely  down  and  leav- 
ing God  to  do  it  all.  Without  the  sailors  the  ship  could  not 
be  properly  beached. 

32.  The  ropes  {ta  schoinia).  Diminutive  of  schoinos,  old 
word,  but  in  N.T.  only  here  and  John  2:15.  Paul  is  now 
saviour  of  the  ship  and  the  soldiers  quickly  cut  loose  the  skiff 
and  "let  her  fall  off"  {eiasan  auten  ekpesein)  rather  than  be 
the  means  of  the  escape  of  the  sailors  who  were  needed. 
This  dastardly  scheme  of  the  sailors  would  have  brought 
frightful  loss  of  life. 

33.  While  the  day  was  coming  on  (achri  hou  hemera  emellen 
ginesthai).  More  likely  here  achri  hou  (for  achri  toutou  hoi) 
with  the  imperfect  emellen^  has  its  usual  meaning,  "until 
which  time  day  was  about  to  come  on  {ginesthai,  present 
middle  infinitive,  linear  action)."  That  is  Paul  kept  on 
exhorting  or  beseeching  (parekalei,  imperfect  active)  them 
until  dawn  began  to  come  on  (cf.  verse  39  when  day  came). 
In  Heb.  3:13  achri  hou  with  the  present  indicative  has  to 
mean  "  so  long  as  "  or  while,  but  that  is  not  true  here  (Robert- 
son, Grammar,  p.  975).  See  on  Acts  2:46  for  the  same  phrase 
for  partaking  food  {metalambano  trophes,  genitive  case)  as 


472      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

also  in  27:34.  Paul  wanted  them  to  be  ready  for  action  when 
day  really  came.  "Fourteenth  day"  repeated  (verse  27), 
only  here  in  the  accusative  of  duration  of  time  {hemeran). 
It  is  not  clear  whether  the  "waiting"  (prosdokontes,  present 
active  participle  predicate  nominative  complementary  par- 
ticiple after  diateleite,  Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1121)  means 
fourteen  days  of  continuous  fasting  or  only  fourteen  succes- 
sive nights  of  eager  watching  without  food.  Galen  and  Dio- 
nysius  of  Halicamassus  employ  the  very  idiom  used  here  by 
Luke  (asitos  diateleo).  Having  taken  nothing  {methen  prosla- 
bomenoi).  Second  aorist  middle  participle  of  proslambano 
with  the  accusative  methen  rather  than  the  more  usual 
meden.  Probably  Paul  means  that  they  had  taken  no  regular 
meals,  only  bits  of  food  now  and  then. 

34.  For  this  is  for  your  safety  (touto  gar  pros  tes  humeteras 
soterias  huparchex).  Note  soteria  in  sense  of  "safety," 
literal  meaning,  not  spiritual  salvation.  This  is  the  only 
instance  in  the  N.T.  of  the  use  of  pros  with  the  ablative 
meaning  "from  the  side  of"  your  safety,  though  a  classic 
idiom  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  623),  an  example  of  Luke's 
literary  style.  Perish  (apoleitai).  Future  middle  (intransi- 
tive) of  apollumi  {-uo),  to  destroy.  So  the  oldest  MSS.  rather 
than  peseitai  from  pipto,  to  fall.  This  proverbial  expression 
occurs  also  in  Luke  21:18  which  see  and  in  I  Sam.  14:45; 
II  Sam.  14:11;  I  King,  1:52. 

35.  Gave  thanks  to  God  (eucharistesen  tot  theoi).  First 
aorist  active  indicative  of  eucharisteb  from  which  our  word 
"Eucharist"  comes.  It  was  saying  grace  like  the  head  of  a 
Hebrew  family  and  the  example  of  Paul  would  encourage  the 
others  to  eat.  Probably  Paul,  Luke,  and  Aristarchus  had 
memories  of  the  Lord's  supper  (Acts  2:42)  while  to  others 
it  was  only  an  ordinary  meal  (Luke  24:30). 

36.  Then  were  they  all  of  good  cheer  {euthumoi  de  genomenox). 
More  exactly,  "Then  all  becoming  cheerful,"  because  of 
Paul's  words  and  conduct.    Took  food  (proselabonto  trophes). 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  473 

Partitive  genitive  here  (some  food),  not  accusative  as  verse 
33.     Paul's  courage  was  contagious. 

37.  Two  hundred  three-score  and  sixteen  souls  {diakosiai 
hehdomekonta  hex).  The  Vatican  Manuscript  (B)  has  hbs  in 
place  of  diakosiai  (two  hundred)  which  Westcott  and  Hort 
put  in  the  margin.  But  Alford  is  probably  correct  in  suggest- 
ing that  the  scribe  of  B  wrote  hos  by  repeating  the  omega 
in  ploioi  with  s  =  2CX)  (Greek  numeral).  If  the  number  276 
seems  large,  it  is  to  be  remembered  that  we  do  not  know  the 
size  of  the  ship.  Josephus  (Lifey  3)  says  that  there  were  600 
on  the  ship  that  took  him  to  Italy.  The  grain  ships  were  of 
considerable  size.  The  number  included  sailors,  soldiers,  and 
prisoners.    A  muster  or  roll  call  may  have  been  made. 

38.  fFhen  they  had  eaten  enough  (koresthentes  trophes). 
First  aorist  passive  of  korennumij  old  verb  to  satisfy,  to 
satiate,  with  the  genitive.  Literally,  ''Having  been  satisfied 
with  food."  Here  only  in  the  N.T.  They  lightened  (ekouphi- 
zon).  Inchoative  imperfect  active,  began  to  lighten.  Old 
verb  from  kouphos  and  originally  to  be  light,  but  transitive 
to  lighten,  as"  here,  from  Hippocrates  on.  Throwing  out  the 
wheat  {ekballomenoi  ton  siton).  The  cargo  of  wheat.  The 
second  ekbole  (verse  18)  or  casting  out  and  overboard  which 
was  only  partially  done  at  first. 

39.  They  knew  not  (ouk  epeginoskon).  Imperfect  active  of 
epiginosko,  to  recognize.  Probably  conative,  tried  to  recog- 
nize and  could  not  (Conybeare  and  Howson).  The  island  was 
well-known  (28:1,  epegnomen),  but  St.  Paul's  Bay  where  the 
wreck  took  place  was  some  distance  from  the  main  harbour 
(Valetta)  of  Melita  (Malta).  They  perceived  (katenooun). 
Imperfect  active  of  katanoeo,  gradually  perceived  after  some 
effort  as  in  Ii:i6.  This  beach  seemed  their  only  hope.  They 
took  counsel  (ebouleuonto) .  Imperfect  middle  showing  the 
process  of  deliberation  and  doubt.  The  bay  "having  a 
beach"  (echonta  aigialon)  is  a  phrase  found  in  Xenophon's 
Anabasis  VI.  4,  4.     Whether  they  could  drive  (ei  dunainto 


474     WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

eksosat).  This  use  of  the  optative  with  ei  in  questions  of  this 
sort  (implied  indirect)  is  a  neat  Greek  idiom  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  p.  1021).  B  C  Bohairic  read  eksosat  (first  aorist 
active  infinitive  of  €ksdzd),to  save  out  (so  Westcott  and  Hort), 
instead  of  exosai  (from  exothed,  to  push  out,  as  Textus  Recep- 
tus). 

40.  Casting  off  {perielonies).  Second  aorist  active  of  per- 
iaireo.  Literally,  "Having  taken  away  from  around,"  that 
is  all  four  anchors  from  around  the  stem.  Cf.  the  other 
verbs  with  agkuras  in  verse  29  and  30.  They  left  them  in  the 
sea  (eion  eis  ten  thalassan).  Imperfect  active  of  eao,  either 
descriptive  or  inchoative.  They  let  the  anchors  go  and  the 
ropes  fell  down  into  the  sea.  At  the  same  time  loosing  the 
hands  of  the  rudders  {hama  anentes  tas  zeukterias  ton  pedalion). 
On  the  use  of  hama  with  the  participle,  old  Greek  idiom  see 
Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1139.  The  second  aorist  active 
participle  of  aniemi,  to  relax,  loosen  up.  Old  verb,  in  N.T. 
Acts  16:26;  27:40;  Eph.  6:9;  Heb.  13:5.  Thayer  notes  that 
zeukterias  (bands)  occurs  nowhere  else,  but  several  papyri 
use  it  of  yokes  and  waterwheels  (Moulton  and  Milligan's 
Vocabulary).  The  word  for  rudders  {pedalion)  is  an  old  one 
(from  pedon,  the  blade  of  an  oar),  but  in  the  N.T.  only  here 
and  James  3  \\.  Page  notes  that  the  ancient  ships  had  a  pair 
of  paddle  rudders  like  those  of  the  early  northmen,  one  on 
each  quarter.  The  paddle  rudders  had  been  fastened  while 
the  ship  was  anchored.  Hoisting  up  the  foresail  to  the  wind 
[eparantes  ton  artemona  tei  pneousei).  Supply  aurdi  (breeze) 
after  pneousei  (blowing).  It  Is  not  clear  what  "sail"  is 
meant  by  "artemona.^*  No  other  example  in  Greek  is  known, 
though  the  scholiast  to  Juvenal  XII.  68  explains  velo  prora 
suo  by  artemone  solo.  Hence  *' foresail"  is  probably  correct. 
They  made  for  the  beach  {kateidhon  eis  ton  aigialon).  Imperfect 
active  of  katecho,  to  hold  down,  perhaps  inchoative.  "They 
began  to  hold  the  ship  steadily  for  the  beach." 

41.  But  lighting  upon  (peripesontes  de).    Second  aorist  ac- 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  475 

tive  participle  of  peripiptd,  old  verb  to  fall  into  and  so  be 
encompassed  by  as  in  Luke  10:30;  James  1:2.  There  is  a 
current  on  one  side  of  St.  Paul's  Bay  between  a  little  island 
(Salmonetta)  and  Malta  which  makes  a  sand  bank  between 
the  two  currents.  Unexpectedly  the  ship  stuck  in  this  sand- 
bar. Where  two  seas  met  {dithalasson).  Used  in  Strabo  and 
Dio  Chrysostom  for  divided  seas  {dis,  thalassa).  They  ran 
the  vessel  aground  (epekeilan  ten  naun).  First  aorist  active 
indicative  of  old  verb  epikello,  to  run  a  ship  ashore.  Only 
here  in  N.T.  Here  also  we  have  the  only  N.T.  use  of  naus 
for  ship  (from  nao,  neb,  to  swim)  so  common  in  ancient  Greek. 
Our  word  navy  is  from  this  word  through  the  Latin.  Struck 
{ereisasa).  First  aorist  active  participle  of  ereido,  old  verb 
to  fix  firmly.  Only  here  in  N.T.  UnmoveaUe  (asaleutos). 
From  a  privative  and  saleuo  to  shake.  Old  word.  In  N.T. 
only  here  and  Heb.  12:28.  Began  to  break  up  {elueto).  Inchoa- 
tive imperfect  passive  of  the  old  verb  luo,  to  loosen.  The 
prow  was  stuck  in  the  sand-bar,  and  the  stern  was  breaking 
to  pieces  by  the  opposing  waves  lashing  on  both  sides.  It 
was  a  critical  moment. 

42.  Counsel  was  to  kill  {boule  egeneto  hina — apokteinbsin). 
The  soldiers  did  not  relish  the  idea  of  the  escape  of  the 
prisoners.  Hence  there  came  this  "counsel"  (boule).  Regular 
Greek  idiom  for  purpose  (hina  and  aorist  active  subjunctive 
of  apokteino,  to  kill).  Soldiers  were  responsible  for  the  lives 
of  prisoners  (Acts  12:19).  Swim  out  {ekkolumbesas).  First 
aorist  active  participle  of  ekkolumbao,  old  verb  to  swim  out 
and  so  away.  Escape  (diaphugei).  Second  aorist  (effective) 
active  subjunctive  of  diapheugo,  to  make  a  clean  (dia)  escape. 

43.  To  save  Paul  {diasbsai  ton  Paulon).  Effective  first 
aorist  active  infinitive  of  diasbzb.  And  no  wonder  for  the 
centurion  knew  now  how  much  they  all  owed  to  Paul. 
Stayed  them  from  their  purpose  [ekbleusen  autous  tou  boule- 
matos.)  Ablative  case  of  boulema  after  ekbleusen  (from 
kbleub,  to  hinder,  common  verb),  ^nd  get  first  to  land  {prbtous

eis  ten  gen  exienai).  This  classic  verb  exeimi  occurs  four  times 
in  Acts  (13:42;  17:15;  20:7;  27:32)  and  nowhere  else  in  the 
N.T.    It  was  a  wise  command. 

44.  Some  on  planks  {hous  men  epi  sanisin).  Common 
Greek  idiom  {hous  men — hous  de)  for  "some — some." 
The  only  N.T.  instance  of  the  old  Greek  word  sanis  for 
board  or  plank.  The  breaking  of  the  ship  gave  scraps  of 
timber  which  some  used.  They  all  escaped  safe  {pantas 
diasothenai).  First  aorist  passive  infinitive  of  diasozo  (the 
very  word  used  for  the  desire  of  the  centurion  about  Paul) 
with  accusative  of  general  reference,  the  clause  being  subject 
of  egeneto.  So  Luke  in  this  marvellous  narrative,  worthy  of 
any  historian  in  any  age,  shows  how  Paul's  promise  was  ful- 
filled (verse  24).  Paul  the  prisoner  is  the  hero  of  the  voyage 
and  shipwreck,  a  wonderful  example  of  God's  providential 
care. 


CHAPTER  XXVIII 

1.  Then  we  knew  {tote  epegnomen).  Second  aorist  (in- 
gressive)  active  indicative  of  epiginosko.  Then  we  recognized. 
See  27:39.  Was  called  (kaleitai).  Present  passive  indicative 
retained  in  indirect  discourse.  Melita  {M elite).  Not  Miletene 
as  only  B  reads,  a  clerical  error,  but  retained  in  the  text  of 
Westcott  and  Hort  because  of  B.  Page  notes  that  the  island 
was  Malta  as  is  shown  from  the  name,  the  location,  the 
presence  of  a  ship  from  Alexandria  bound  for  Rome  winter- 
ing there  (verse  11),  and  the  mention  of  Syracuse  as  the  next 
stop  after  leaving  (verse  12). 

2.  The  barbarians  (hoi  barbaroi).  The  Greeks  called  all  men 
"barbarians"  who  did  not  speak  Greek  (Rom.  1:14),  not 
"barbarians"  in  our  sense  of  rude  and  uncivilized,  but  simply 
"foreign  folk."  Diodorus  Siculus  (V.  12)  says  that  it  was  a 
colony  of  the  Phoenicians  and  so  their  language  was  Punic 
(Page).  The  word  originally  meant  an  uncouth  repetition 
(barbar)  not  understood  by  others  (I  Cor.  14:11).  In  Col. 
3:11  Paul  couples  it  with  Scythian  as  certainly  not  Christian. 
These  are  (with  verse  4  below)  the  only  N.T.  instances. 
Showed  us  (pareichan).  Imperfect  active  of  parecho  with  -an 
instead  of  -on  as  eichan  in  Mark  8  '.7  (Robertson,  Grammar, 
p.  339).  It  was  their  habit  on  this  occasion,  Luke  means, 
they  kept  on  showing.  No  common  kindness  (ou  ten  tuchousan 
philanthrbpian) .  The  old  word  philanthrbpia  {philos,  an- 
thropos),  love  of  mankind,  occurs  in  the  N.T.  only  here  and 
Titus  3:4  (adverb  in  27:3).  See  on  19:11  for  this  use  of  ow  <?n 
tuchousan,  "not  the  kindness  that  happens  every  day." 
They  were  not  "wreckers"  to  take  advantage  of  the  calam- 
ity. They  kindled  afire  (hapsantes  puran).  The  only  N.T. 
example  and  verse  3  of  the  old  word  pura  (from  pur,  fire), 
a  pile  of  burning  fuel  (sticks).    First  aorist  active  participle 

477 


478      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

of  haptOf  to  set  fire  to,  to  kindle.  Cf.  anapto  in  Luke  12:49. 
Received  us  all  {proselabonto  pantas  hemds).  Second  aorist 
middle  (indirect  indicative  of  proslamhano.  They  took  us 
all  to  themselves  (cf.  Acts  18:26).  The  present  {ton  ephestota). 
Second  perfect  active  participle  (intransitive)  of  ephistemi^ 
"the  rain  that  stood  upon  them"  (the  pouring  rain).  Only 
in  Luke  and  Paul  in  N.T. 

3.  fVhen  Paul  had  gathered  (sustrepsantos  tou  Paulou). 
Genitive  absolute  with  first  aorist  active  participle  of  sus- 
trepho,  old  verb  to  twist  or  turn  together  or  roll  into  a  bundle. 
In  N.T.  only  here  and  Matt.  17:22.  A  bundle  of  sticks  {phru- 
ganon  ti  plethos).  "Some  multitude  (or  pile)  of  dry  twigs" 
{phruganon  from  phrugo  or  phrusso,  to  dry.  Only  here  in 
N.T.).  Laid  {epithentos) .  So  genitive  absolute  again  with 
second  aorist  active  participle  of  epitithemi,  to  place  upon. 
Few  things  show  Paul  to  better  advantage  than  this  incident. 
By  reason  of  the  heat  {apo  tes  thermes).  Old  word,  only  here 
in  N.T.  Ablative  case  with  apo  (from  the  heat).  The  viper 
was  in  a  state  of  torpor  in  the  bundle  of  sticks.  The  heat 
wakened  him.  A  viper  (echidna).  The  old  word  used  by  the 
Baptist  of  the  Pharisees  (Matt.  3:7  =  Luke  3:7)  and  by 
Jesus  also  (Matt.  12:34;  23:33).  It  is  objected  that  there 
is  little  wood  in  the  island  today  and  no  vipers,  though 
Lewin  as  late  as  1853  believes  that  he  saw  a  viper  near  St. 
Paul's  Bay.  But  the  island  now  has  1,200  people  to  the 
square  mile  and  snakes  of  any  kind  have  a  poor  chance. 
The  viper  has  also  disappeared  from  Arran  as  the  island 
became  more  frequented  (Knowling).  Ramsay  thinks  that 
the  small  constrictor  {Coronella  Austriaca)  which  still  exists 
in  the  island  may  be  the  "viper,"  though  it  has  no  poison 
fangs,  but  clings  and  bites.  The  natives  thought  that  it  was 
a  poisonous  viper.  Fastened  on  his  hand  (kathepse  tes  cheiros 
autou).  First  aorist  active  indicative  of  kathaptOy  to  fasten 
down  on  with  the  genitive  case.  Old  verb,  here  only  in  N.T. 
Cf.  Mark  16:18. 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  479 

4.  The  beast  (to  therion).  Diminutive  of  ther  and  so  little 
beast.  See  on  Mark  i  rij.  Aristotle  and  the  medical  writers 
apply  the  word  to  venomous  serpents,  the  viper  in  particular 
(Knowling),  as  Luke  does  here.  Vincent  calls  attention  to  the 
curious  history  of  our  word  "treacle"  for  molasses  (Latin 
theriaca)  from  theriak},  an  antidote  made  from  the  flesh  of 
vipers.  Coverdale  translates  Jer.  8:22:  "There  is  no  more 
treacle  in  Gilead."  Jeremy  Taylor:  "We  kill  the  viper  and 
make  treacle  of  him."  Hanging  from  his  hand  {kremamenon 
ek  tes  cheiros  autou).  Vivid  picture  of  the  snake  dangling 
from  Paul's  hand.  Present  middle  participle  of  kremamaiy 
late  form  for  kremannumi,  to  hang  up,  to  suspend  (cf.  Gal. 
3  :i3).  No  doubt  {pantos).  Literally,  By  all  means,  old  adverb. 
Cf.  21:22;  Luke  4:23;  I  Cor.  9:22.  Only  by  Luke  and  Paul 
in  the  N.T.  "They  knew  that  he  was  a  prisoner  being  taken 
to  Rome  on  some  grave  charge,  and  inferred  that  the  charge 
was  murder"  (Page).  Though  he  hath  escaped  (diasothenta). 
First  aorist  passive  participle  of  diasozo  (same  verb  used  in 
24:43,  44  and  28:1),  so-called  concessive  use  of  the  participle 
(Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  1 129).  Yet  Justice  (dike).  An 
abstraction  personified  like  the  Latin  Justitia  (Page).  The 
natives  speak  of  Dike  as  a  goddess,  but  we  know  nothing 
of  such  actual  worship  in  Malta,  though  the  Greeks  wor- 
shipped abstractions  as  in  Athens.  Hath  not  suffered  (ouk 
eiasen).  Did  not  suffer.  They  look  on  Paul  as  a  doomed  man 
as  good  as  dead.  These  people  thought  that  calamity  was 
proof  of  guilt,  poor  philosophy  and  worse  theology. 

5.  Shook  off  (apotinaxas) .  First  aorist  active  participle 
of  apotinasso,  to  shake  off.  Rare  word  (Euripides,  Galen, 
LXX).    In  N.T.  only  here  and  Luke  9:5. 

6.  But  they  expected  {hoi  de  prosedokon).  Imperfect  active, 
were  expecting,  continued  to  expect.  That  he  would  have 
swollen  {auton  mellein  pimprasthai).  More  exactly,  "Expect- 
ing him  to  be  about  (or  that  he  was  about)  to  swell  up." 
Pimprasthai  is  present  middle  infinitive  from  pimpremi,  to 


48o     WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

blow,  to  bum,  to  inflame,  to  cause  to  swell.  Prethb^  to  swell, 
seems  connected  and  both  use  the  aorist  epresa.  Our  word 
"inflammation"  likewise  means  a  burning  and  a  swelling. 
This  verb  is  a  common  medical  term  used  as  Luke  has  it. 
It  occurs  here  only  in  N.T.  Or  fallen  down  dead  suddenly 
{}  katapiptein  aphno  nekron).  Rather,  "or  was  about  to  fall 
down  dead  suddenly."  The  two  common  results  of  a  bite 
by  a  viper  or  other  poisonous  snake,  both  medical  terms 
used  by  Luke.  But  when  they  were  long  in  expectation  {epi 
polu  de  auton  prosdokonton).  Genitive  absolute.  "But  while 
they  were  expecting  for  much  time."  Nothing  amiss  come 
to  him  (meden  atopon  eis  auton  ginomenon).  "Nothing  out 
of  place  coming  to  him"  (present  middle  participle).  Meden 
the  usual  negative  of  the  participle  and  the  accusative  case 
the  object  of  theorounton  (genitive  absolute).  Changed  their 
minds  (metabalomenot).  Aorist  middle  (direct)  participle  of 
metaballo,  old  verb  to  turn  about  or  around,  turning  them- 
selves about,  changing  their  minds.  Plato  uses  this  very 
verb  in  middle  voice  for  changing  the  mind.  That  he  was  a 
god  {auton  einai  theon).  Accusative  and  infinitive  in  indirect 
discourse.  At  Lystra  Paul  was  first  received  as  a  god  (Mer- 
cury) and  then  they  stoned  him  to  kill  him  (Acts  14:11, 
19).    So  fickle  is  popular  favour. 

7.  To  the  chief  man  of  the  island  (toi  protoi  tes  nesou). 
An  official  title  correct  in  Malta  (Ramsay,  St.  Paul,  p.  343). 
An  inscription  in  Malta  calls  Prudens  "Primate  of  the 
Maltese"  {protos  Melitaion).  Here  it  is  plainly  a  title  and 
not  the  common  use  seen  in  13:50;  25:2;  28:17.  Puhlius 
(Poplioi).  This  Greek  name  (praenomen)  can  be  derived 
either  from  Popilius  or  Publius  (cf.  publicus  for  populicus 
from  populus).  Entertained  us  (exenisen  hemds).  Paul  and 
his  companions  (Luke  and  Aristarchus).  Was  Julius  in- 
cluded.^ On  xenizo  see  Acts  10:23.  Courteously  (philo- 
phronos).  This  old  adverb  from  philophron  (philos,  phren, 
friendly  mind)  occurs  here  alone  in  the  N.T.     In  a  kindly 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  48 1 

or  friendly  manner,  all  the  more  so  because  of  the  original 
suspicion  of  Paul  as  a  criminal. 

8.  Lay  {katakeisthai).  Common  verb  for  the  sick  (Mark 
1:30;  John  5:6).  Sick  {sunechomenon).  "Held  together." 
Common  verb  again  for  the  sick  as  in  Luke  4:38.  Of  fever 
(puretois).  Instrumental  case,  and  plural  "fevers,"  medical 
term  for  intermittent  attacks  of  fever  (Demosthenes,  Lucian, 
medical  writers).  Dysentery  {dusenteridi).  Instrumental 
case  also.  Late  form  of  the  older  dusenteria  and  only  here  in 
N.T.  Our  very  word  dysentery.  Another  medical  term  of 
which  Luke  uses  so  many.  Hippocrates  often  mentions 
these  two  diseases  together.  Laying  his  hands  on  him  healed 
him  {epitheis  tas  cheiras  autoi  iasato  auton).  Either  like  the 
laying  on  of  hands  in  James  5:14,  the  gift  of  healing  (I  Cor. 
I2:9f.),  or  the  tender  interest  of  Jesus  when  he  took  hold  of 
the  hand  of  Peter's  mother-in-law  (Mark  1:31).  Ramsay 
argues  that  iaomai  is  employed  here  of  the  miraculous  heal- 
ing by  Paul  while  therapeud  is  used  of  the  cures  by  Luke  the 
physician  (verse  9).  This  is  a  general  distinction  and  it  is 
probably  observed  here,  but  in  Luke  6:18  (which  see)  both 
verbs  are  employed  of  the  healings  by  Jesus.  Came  and  were 
healed  (proserchonto  kai  etherapeuonto).  Imperfect  middle 
and  imperfect  passive.  A  regular  stream  of  patients  came 
during  these  months.  Luke  had  his  share  in  the  honours, 
"us"  {hemds)f  and  no  doubt  his  share  in  the  cures.  With 
many  honours  (pollais  timais).  Instrumental  case.  The  word 
was  often  applied  to  payment  for  professional  services  as 
we  today  speak  of  an  honorarium.  They  put  on  board  {epe- 
thento).  Second  aorist  middle  indicative  of  epitithemi,  to 
put  on.  The  idea  of  "on  board"  is  merely  suggested  by 
anagomenois  (when  we  sailed)  "the  things  for  our  needs" 
{ta  pros  tas  chreias). 

II.  Which  had  wintered  (parakecheimakott).  Perfect  active 
participle  of  paracheimazo,  to  pass  the  winter.  Old  verb, 
inN.T.  only  27:12;  28:11;  I  Cor.  16:6; Titus  3:12.  Theloca- 


482      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAiMENT 

tive  case  agreeing  with  ploibi.  Navigation  in  the  Mediter- 
ranean usually  opened  up  in  February  (always  by  March), 
spring  beginning  on  Feb.  9  (Page).  Whose  sign  was  the  Twin 
Brothers  (parasemoi  Dioskourois).  The  word  parasemoi  can 
be  either  a  substantive  (as  Revised  Version  has  it)  or  an 
adjective  "marked  by  the  sign,"  examples  of  both  uses 
common  in  ancient  Greek.  Dioskourois  is  in  apposition  with 
parasemoi.  The  word  means  the  twin  sons  (kouros  or  koros) 
of  Zeus  {Dios^  genitive  of  Zeus)  and  Leda,  viz..  Castor  and 
Pollux.  The  Attic  used  the  dual,  to  Dioskoro.  Castor  and 
Pollux  were  the  tutelary  deities  of  sailors  whose  figures 
were  painted  one  on  each  side  of  the  prow  of  the  ship.  This 
sign  was  the  name  of  the  ship.  So  they  start  in  another  grain 
ship  of  Alexandria  bound  for  Rome. 

12.  Touching  (katachthentes).  First  aorist  passive  parti- 
ciple of  katago,  to  go  down  to  land,  just  the  opposite  of  anech- 
themen  in  verse  1 1  from  anago^  to  go  up  to  sea.  At  Syracuse 
{eis  Surakousas).  The  chief  city  of  Sicily  and  eighty  miles 
from  Malta.  Perhaps  open  weather  and  a  southerly  wind 
helped  them  across.  Here  it  was  that  Alcibiades  wrecked 
the  power  and  glory  of  Athens.  Why  the  ship  spent  three 
days  we  do  not  know. 

13.  We  made  a  circuit  (perielthontes) .  Second  aorist  active 
of  perierchomaij  to  go  around,  old  verb,  already  in  19:13. 
See  also  Heb.  11:37;  I  Tim.  5:13.  But  Westcott  and  Hort 
read  perielontes  after  Aleph  B  (from  periaireo)  as  in  27:40, 
though  here  it  could  only  mean  casting  loose,  for  which  no 
other  authority  exists.  At  any  rate  the  ship  had  to  tack  to 
reach  Rhegium  and  was  not  able  to  make  a  straight  course 
(enthudromeo,  16:11).  Rhegium  (Rhegion)  is  from  rhegnumiy 
to  break  off,  the  place  where  the  land  breaks  off,  the  southern 
entrance  to  the  straits  of  Messina.  A  south  wind  sprang  up 
(epigenomenou  notou).  Genitive  absolute  again,  and  for  all 
the  world  like  that  fatal  south  wind  in  27:13,  but  with  no 
bad  results  this  time,  though  the  weather  was  plainly  treach- 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  483 

erous  at  this  early  season.  On  the  second  day  {deuteraioi). 
This  is  the  classical  use  of  the  predicate  adjective,  "  We 
second  day  men"  as  in  Luke  24:22;  John  11:39;  Phil.  3:5 
instead  of  the  adverb  (Robertson,  Grammar ,  p.  657).  To 
Puteoli  {eis  Potiolous).  It  was  182  miles  from  Rhegium  and 
would  require  26  hours  (Page).  It  was  eight  miles  northwest 
from  Neapolis  (Naples)  and  the  chief  port  of  Rome,  the  regu- 
lar harbour  for  the  Alexandrian  ships  from  Rome.  Portions 
of  the  great  mole  are  said  to  be  still  visible. 

14.  Where  we  found  brethren  {hou  heurontes  adelphous). 
Possibly  from  Alexandria,  but,  as  Blass  observes,  it  is  no 
more  strange  to  find  "brethren"  in  Christ  in  Puteoli  when 
Paul  arrives  than  in  Rome.  There  was  a  large  Jewish  quarter. 
Seven  days  {hemeras  hepta).  Accusative  of  extent  of  time. 
Paul  and  his  party  remained  so  long  at  the  urgent  request 
of  the  brethren.  He  was  still  a  prisoner,  but  clearly  Julius 
was  only  too  glad  to  show  another  courtesy  to  Paul  to  whom 
they  all  owed  their  lives.  It  was  130  miles  by  land  from 
Puteoli  to  Rome  over  one  of  the  great  Roman  roads.  And  so 
we  came  to  Rome  {kai  houtos  eis  ten  Romen  elthamen).  So  at 
last.  Luke  is  exultant  as  Page  observes:  Paulus  Romae 
captivus:  triumphus  unicus.  It  is  the  climax  of  the  book  of 
Acts  (19:21 ;  23 :i i),  but  not  the  close  of  Paul's  career.  Page 
rightly  remarks  that  a  new  paragraph  should  begin  with 
verse  15,  for  brethren  came  from  Rome  and  this  part  of  the 
journey  is  touched  with  the  flavour  of  that  incident.  The 
great  event  is  that  Paul  reached  Rome,  but  not  as  he  had 
once  hoped  (Rom.  15:22-29). 

1 5.  When  they  heard  of  us  {akousantes  ta  peri  hemon).  How 
"they  heard  the  things  concerning  us"  we  do  not  know. 
Good  news  had  its  way  of  travel  even  before  the  days  of 
telegraph,  telephone,  daily  papers.  Possibly  Julius  had  to 
send  on  special  couriers  with  news  of  his  arrival  after  the 
shipwreck.  Possibly  some  of  the  brethren  in  Puteoli  at  once 
(beginning  of  the  week)  sent  on  news  to  the  brethren  in 


484      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Rome.  The  church  in  Rome  had  long  ago  received  Paul's 
letter  from  Corinth  at  the  hands  of  Phoebe.  To  meet  us  (eis 
apantesin  hemin).  Idiomatic  phrase,  "for  meeting  with  us" 
(associative  instrumental  case).  Koine  word  apantesis  from 
verb  apantao,  to  meet,  in  N.T.  only  here;  Matt.  25:6;  I  Tim. 
4:17.  Use  after  eis  rather  than  infinitive  like  a  translation 
Hebraism  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  91).  As  far  as  the  Market 
of  Appius  {achri  Appiou  Phorou).  The  Forum  of  Appius, 
90  miles  from  Puteoli,  40  from  Rome,  on  the  great  Appian 
Way.  The  Censor  Appius  Claudius  had  constructed  this 
part  of  the  road,  b.c.  312.  Paul  probably  struck  the  Appian 
Way  at  Capua.  Portions  of  this  great  stone  highway  are 
still  in  use.  If  one  wishes  to  tread  where  Paul  trod,  he  can  do 
it  here.  Appii  Forum  had  a  bad  reputation,  the  haunt  of 
thieves,  thugs,  and  swindlers.  What  would  this  motley 
crowd  think  of  Paul  chained  to  a  soldier.^  Three  Taverns 
{Trion  Tabernon).  Genitive  case  after  achri  like  Appiou 
Phorou.  About  30  miles  from  Rome.  Tres  Tabernae.  Whom 
(hous).  Two  groups  of  the  disciples  came  (one  Gentile,  one 
Jewish,  Rackham  thinks),  one  to  Appii  Forum,  the  other 
to  Three  Taverns.  It  was  a  joyous  time  and  Julius  would 
not  interfere.  Took  courage  (elabe  tharsos).  The  old  sub- 
stantive tharsos  is  here  alone  in  the  N.T.  Jesus  himself  had 
exhorted  Paul  to  be  of  good  courage  (tharsei  Acts  23:11)  as 
he  had  done  the  disciples  (John  16:33).  Paul  had  passed 
through  enough  to  cause  depression,  whether  he  was  de- 
pressed or  not,  but  he  deeply  appreciated  this  kindly  sym- 
pathy. 

16.  Paul  was  suffered  to  abide  by  himself  {epetrape  tot 
Paulbi  menein  kath*  heauton).  Second  aorist  passive  of 
epitrepo,  to  permit  or  allow.  Literally,  "It  was  permitted  to 
Paul  to  abide  by  himself."  Some  late  documents  (Textus 
Receptus)  here  add:  "The  centurion  delivered  the  prisoners 
to  the  captain  of  the  guard"  (or  the  stratopedarch).  This 
officer  used  to  be  considered  Burrus  who  was  Prefect  of  the 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  485 

Praetorian  Guard  a.d.  51-62.  But  it  is  by  no  means  certain 
that  Julius  turned  the  prisoners  over  to  this  officer.  It  seems 
more  likely  that  Julius  would  report  to  the  captain  of  the 
Peregrini.  If  so,  we  may  be  sure  that  Julius  would  give  a 
good  report  of  Paul  to  this  officer  who  would  be  kindly  dis- 
posed and  would  allow  Paul  comparative  freedom  (living 
by  himself,  in  his  lodging,  verse  23,  his  own  hired  house 
verse  30,  though  still  chained  to  a  soldier).  With  the  soldier 
that  guarded  him  {sun  tot  phulassonti  auton  stratiotei).  Prob- 
ably a  new  soldier  every  day  or  night,  but  always  with  this 
soldier  chained  to  his  right  hand  day  and  night.  Now  that 
Paul  is  in  Rome  what  can  he  do  for  Christ  while  he  awaits  the 
outcome  of  his  own  appeal  to  Nero? 

17.  Those  that  were  the  chief  of  the  Jews  (tous  ontas  ton 
loudaion  protous).  This  use  of  protos  for  the  leading  men  of 
a  city  or  among  the  Jews  we  have  already  had  in  13:50; 
25:2;  Luke  19:47.  Literally,  "Those  that  were  first  among 
the  Jews."  The  position  of  the  participle  ontas  between  the 
article  and  the  adjective  protous  is  regular  (Robertson, 
Grammar,  p.  777).  When  they  were  come  together  {sunelthon- 
ton  auton).  Genitive  absolute  again.  Paul  could  not  go  to 
the  synagogue,  as  his  custom  was,  being  a  bound  prisoner. 
So  he  invited  the  Jewish  leaders  to  come  to  his  lodging  and 
hear  his  explanation  of  his  presence  in  Rome  as  a  prisoner 
with  an  appeal  to  Caesar.  He  is  anxious  that  they  may  un- 
derstand that  this  appeal  was  forced  upon  him  by  Festus 
following  Felix  and  not  because  he  has  come  to  make  an 
attack  on  the  Jewish  people.  He  was  sure  that  false  reports 
had  come  to  Rome.  These  non-Christian  Jews  accepted 
Paul's  invitation.  Nothing  against  {ouden  enantion).  Adjec- 
tive here  as  in  26:9,  not  preposition  as  in  7:10;  8:32.  From 
en  and  antios  (anti),  face  to  face.  Concessive  participle 
poiesas  as  in  verse  4  (diasothenta)  which  see.  Yet  was  I  de- 
livered prisoner  from  Jerusalem  into  the  hands  of  the  Romans 
{desmios  ex  lerosolumon  paredothen  eis  tas  cheiras  ton  Rom-

aion).  This  condensed  statement  does  not  explain  how  he 
"was  delivered,"  for  in  fact  the  Jews  were  trying  to  kill 
him  when  Lysias  rescued  him  from  the  mob  (22:27-36). 
The  Jews  were  responsible  for  his  being  in  the  hands  of  the 
Romans,  though  they  had  hoped  to  kill  him  first. 

18.  When  they  had  examined  me  (anakrinantes  me).  First 
aorist  active  participle  of  anakrino,  the  same  verb  used 
already  in  24:8;  25:6,  26  of  the  judicial  examinations  by  Felix 
and  Festus.  Desired  (eboulonto).  Imperfect  middle  of  at- 
tempted action  or  picture  of  their  real  attitude.  This  is  a 
correct  statement  as  the  words  of  both  Felix  and  Festus  show. 
Because  there  was  {dia  to  —  huparchein).  Accusative  case 
with  dia  (causal  use)  with  the  articular  infinitive,  "Because 
of  the  being  no  cause  of  death  in  me"  {en  emoiy  in  my  case, 
aitia,  usual  word  for  crime  or  charge  of  crime). 

19.  fFhen  the  Jews  spake  against  it  {antilegonton  ton  lou- 
daion).  Genitive  absolute  again,  antilegonton  (aniilego) 
common  verb  for  speaking  against  as  in  13:45.  Clementer 
dicit  (Bengal).  "The  word  is  a  mild  one  to  describe  the  bitter 
enmity  of  the  Jews"  (Knowling).  /  was  constrained  (enag- 
kasthen).  "T  was  compelled,"  first  aorist  passive  indicative 
of  anagkazo,  the  very  word  used  of  Paul's  efforts  to  get  the 
Christians  to  blaspheme  (26:11)  which  see.  Paul  was  com- 
pelled to  appeal  to  Caesar  (see  25:1 1  and  12  for  this  phrase), 
unless  Paul  was  willing  to  be  the  victim  of  Jewish  hate  when 
he  had  done  no  wrong.  Not  thai  I  had  aught  to  accuse  my  na- 
tion of  {ouch  hos  tou  ethnous  mou  echon  ti  kategorein).  This 
use  of  hos  with  a  participle  {echon)  is  common  in  Greek  for 
the  alleged  reason.  The  genitive  case  with  the  infinitive 
kategorein  is  regular.  Paul  says  ethnos  instead  of  laos  as  in 
24:17;   26:4. 

20.  Did  I  intreat  {parekalesa).  Did  I  invite  you.  Because 
of  the  hope  of  Israel  {heineken  tes  elpidos  tou  Israel).  Genitive 
with  preposition  heineken.  The  hope  of  the  Messiah  is  his 
point  as  in  26:6.    /  am  bound  with  this  chain  {ten  halusin  tau- 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  487 

t?n  perikeimai) .  This  old  verb  means  to  lie  around  as  in 
Luke  17:2;  Heb.  12:1.  But  it  is  also  used  as  the  passive  of 
peritithemi^  to  place  around  with  the  accusative  of  periti- 
themi  retained.  It  is  a  transitive  passive.  Paul  does  not  lie 
around  the  chain,  but  the  chain  lies  around  him,  a  curious 
reversal  of  the  imagery  (Robertson,  Grammar,  p.  815). 

21.  LetUrs  {grammata).  Official  documents  from  the  San- 
hedrin  about  the  charges  against  Paul.  Any  harm  of  thee 
{ti  peri  sou  poneron).  Eml  (poneron).  The  three  aorists 
{edexametha,  apeggeilen,  elalesen)  cover  the  past.  These 
Jews  do  not  mean  to  say  that  they  had  never  heard  of  Paul. 
It  is  hardly  likely  that  they  had  heard  of  his  appeal  to 
Caesar,  "for  how  could  the  news  have  reached  Rome  be- 
fore Paul.?"  (Page). 

22.  But  we  desire  (axioumen  de).  Old  verb  axioo,  to  deem 
worthy,  to  think  right  or  proper  as  in  15:38  which  see.  They 
think  it  only  fair  to  hear  Paul's  side  of  his  case.  Concerning 
this  sect  (peri  tes  haireseos  tautes\.  Paul  had  identified  Chris- 
tianity with  Judaism  (verse  20)  in  its  Messianic  hope.  The 
language  seems  to  imply  that  the  number  of  Christians  in 
Rome  was  comparatively  small  and  mainly  Gentile.  If  the 
edict  of  Claudius  for  the  expulsion  of  the  Jews  from  Rome 
(Acts  18:2)  was  due  to  disturbance  over  Christ  {Chrestus), 
then  even  in  Rome  the  Jews  had  special  reason  for  hostility 
towards  Christians.  Everywhere  spoken  against  (pantachou 
antilegetai).  Cf.  verse  19.  The  line  of  cleavage  between  Jew 
and  Christian  was  now  sharply  drawn  everywhere, 

23.  Appointed  (taxamenoi).  First  aorist  middle  participle 
of  tasso.  Formal  arrangement  as  in  Matt.  28:16  when  Jesus 
appointed  the  mountain  for  his  meeting  in  Galilee.  In  great 
number  (pleiones).  Comparative  of  polus,  "more  than  a 
few."  Expounded  (exetitheto).  Imperfect  middle  of  ektit- 
hemi,  to  set  forth,  as  in  1 1 :4;  18 :26.  He  did  it  with  detail  and 
care  and  spent  all  day  at  it,  "from  morning  till  evening" 
{apo  proi  heds  hesperas).    In  N.T.  only  here,  4:3  and  Luke 


488      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

24:29,  though  common  word.  Persuading  them  concerning 
Jesus  (peithon  autous  peri  tou  lesou).  Conative  present 
active  participle,  trying  to  persuade.  It  was  only  about 
Jesus  that  he  could  make  good  his  claim  concerning  the  hope 
of  Israel  (verse  20).  It  was  Paul's  great  opportunity.  So  he 
appealed  both  to  Moses  and  to  the  prophets  for  proof  as  it 
was  his  custom  to  do. 

24.  Some  believed  {hoi  men  epeithonto).  Imperfect  passive 
indicative  of  peitho.  More  exactly,  "some  began  to  be 
persuaded"  (inchoative).  Some  disbelieved  {hoi  de  epistoun). 
Imperfect  active  of  apisted,  to  disbelieve,  continued  to  dis- 
believe.    It  is  usually  so. 

25.  When  they  agreed  not  {asumphonoi  ontes).  Old  adjec- 
tive, only  here  in  N.T.,  double  compound  {a  privative,  sum, 
phone),  without  symphony,  out  of  harmony,  dissonant,  dis- 
cordant. It  was  a  triumph  to  gain  adherents  at  all  in  such 
an  audience.  They  departed  {apeluonto).  Imperfect  middle 
(direct)  indicative,  "They  loosed  themselves  from  Paul." 
Graphic  close.  After  that  Paul  had  spoken  one  word  {eipontos 
tou  Paulou  rhema  hen).  Genitive  absolute.  One  last  word 
(like  a  preacher)  after  the  all  day  exposition.  Well  {kalos). 
Cf.  Matt.  14:7;  Mark  7:6,  9  (irony).  Here  strong  indigna- 
tion in  the  very  position  of  the  word  (Page).  To  your  fathers 
{pros  tous  pateras  humon).  So  Aleph  A  B  instead  of  hembn 
(our)  like  Stephen  in  7:52  whose  words  Paul  had  heard.  By 
mentioning  the  Holy  Spirit  Paul  shows  (Knowling)  that 
they  are  resisting  God  (7:52). 

26.  Say  {eipon).  Second  aorist  active  imperative  instead  of 
the  old  form  eipe.  The  quotation  is  from  Isa.  6:9  and  10. 
This  very  passage  is  quoted  by  Jesus  (Matt.  13:14  and 
15  =  Mark  4:12  =  Luke  8:10)  in  explanation  of  his  use  of 
parables  and  in  John  12:40  the  very  point  made  by  Paul 
here,  "the  disbelief  of  the  Jews  in  Jesus"  (Page).  See  on 
Matthew  for  discussion  of  the  language  used.  Here  the 
first  time  ("go  to  this  people  and  say")  does  not  occur  in 


THE  ACTS  OF  THE  APOSTLES  489 

Matthew.  It  is  a  solemn  dirge  of  the  doom  of  the  Jews  for 
their  rejection  of  the  Messiah  foreseen  so  long  ago  by  Isaiah. 

28.  This  salvation  (touto  to  soterion).  Adjective  from 
s5ter  (Saviour),  saving,  bringing  salvation.  Common  in  the 
old  Greek.  The  neuter  as  here  often  in  LXX  (as  Psa.  67:2) 
as  substantive  like  soteria  (cf.  Luke  3:6).  They  will  also 
hear  (autoi  kai  akousontai).  Autoi  as  opposed  to  the  rejection 
by  the  Jews,  "vivid  and  antithetical"  (Page). 

30.  Two  whole  years  (dietian  holen).  Only  here  in  N.T. 
and  24:27  which  see.  During  these  busy  years  in  Rome  Paul 
wrote  Philippians,  Philemon,  Colossians,  Ephesians,  Epistles 
that  would  immortalize  any  man,  unless,  forsooth,  one  or 
more  of  them  was  written  from  Ephesus  or  Caesarea,  which 
has  not  yet  been  proven.  In  his  own  hired  dwelling  {en  ididi 
misthomati).  Old  word,  here  only  in  N.T.,  that  which  is 
hired  for  a  price  (from  misthoo  and  that  from  misthosy  hire). 
Received  (apedecheto) .  Imperfect  middle  of  apodechomai, 
received  from  time  to  time  as  they  came,  all  that  came 
ieisporeuomenous)  from  time  to  time.  Preaching  (kerusson), 
teaching  (didaskon),  the  two  things  that  concerned  Paul 
most,  doing  both  as  if  his  right  hand  was  not  in  chains,  to 
the  amazement  of  those  in  Rome  and  in  Philippi  (Phil. 
1:12-14).  None  forbidding  him  (akolutos).  Old  adverb  from 
a  privative  and  the  verbal  adjective  kolutos  (from  koluo,  to 
hinder),  here  only  in  the  N.T.  Page  comments  on  "the 
rhythmic  cadence  of  the  concluding  words."  Page  rejects 
the  notion  that  the  book  is  an  unfinished  work.  It  closes 
with  the  style  of  a  concluded  work.  I  agree  with  Harnack 
that  Luke  wrote  the  Acts  during  this  period  of  two  years  in 
Rome  and  carried  events  no  further  because  they  had  gone 
no  further.  Paul  was  still  a  prisoner  in  Rome  when  Luke 
completed  the  book.  But  he  had  carried  Paul  to  "Rome, 
the  capital  of  the  world,  Urhi  et  Orbi"  (Page).  The  gospel 
of  Christ  has  reached  Rome.  For  the  fate  of  Paul  we  must 
turn  elsewhere.    But  Luke  had  the  presence  of  Paul  while 


490      WORD  PICTURES  IN  NEW  TESTAMENT 

he  carried  the  Acts  to  its  triumphant  conclusion.  Ramsay- 
can  give  a  good  deal  in  proof  of  his  claim  that  Luke  is  the 
greatest  of  all  historians.  Beyond  a  doubt  his  rank  is  high 
and  the  world  can  never  repay  its  debt  to  this  cultured 
physician  who  wrote  the  Gospel  and  the  Acts. 


A.  T.  Robertson 

A.  T.  Robertson,  professor  of  inter- 
pretation of  the  Greek  New  Testament 
at  Southern  Baptist  Theological  Semi- 
nary for  nearly  a  half  century,  was  one 
of  the  most  brilliant  and  popular  Bible 
scholars  of  his  day. 

A  world-famous  authority  on  the 
Greek  New  Testament,  Dr.  Robertson 
was  a  powerful  preacher  and  lecturer, 
and  a  prolific  writer  with  forty-five  vol- 
umes on  both  popular  and  profound 
subjects  to  his  credit.  A  Grammar  of 
the  Greek  New  Testament  in  the  Light 
of  Historical  Research  was  his  greatest 
contribution  to  the  serious  Bible  stu- 
dent, but  his  many  more  concise  New 
Testament  interpretations  have  been 
equally  helpful  to  the  average  Chris- 
tian. 

Among  his  most  popular  works  are: 
A  Harmony  of  the  Gospels  for  Students 
of  the  Life  of  Christ,  Paul  and  the  In- 
tellectuals, Studies  in  Mark's  Gospel, 
Studies  in  the  Epistle  of  James,  Epochs 
in  the  Life  of  Jesus,  and  Epochs  in  the 
Life  of  Paul.

THE  MEANING  OF  THE  NEW  TESTAMENT 

Barclay  M.  Newman 

What  relationship,  if  any,  do  the  New  Testament  books  have 
to  the  social,  economic,  and  intellectual  conditions  of  the  time 
in  which  they  were  written?  How  can  an  understanding  of  this 
relationship  add  to  our  appreciation  of  the  New  Testament?  This 
illuminating  survey  provides  sound  and  satisfying  answers  to 
these  and  other  questions.  It  also  contains  a  brief  history  of  the 
New  Testament  canon  and  a  discussion  of  its  inspiration  and  au- 
thority. Has  numerous  maps,  drawings,  and  photographs..

Frank  Stagg 

This  study  emphasizes  the  New  Testament's  unity  of  thought 
and  defines  its  basic  concern  as  proclaiming  the  story  of  sal- 
vation. Dealing  with  various  New  Testament  theological  ques- 
tions—Christ, salvation,  the  church,  ordinances,  escatology,  and 
others— Dr.  Stagg  gives  fresh  meaning  and  understanding  of 
the  Bible  for  today.
