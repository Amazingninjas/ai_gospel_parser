IMPORTANT NOTE ON TEXT USAGE:
------------------------------
The English text (WEB) is displayed to YOU for reference and navigation, but
the AI NEVER sees or analyzes it. The AI responds based EXCLUSIVELY on the
Greek text (SBLGNT). This ensures scholarly rigor and Greek-first analysis.

Translation differences between WEB and Greek become teaching opportunities
rather than analytical compromises!

4. BASIC USAGE
================================================================================

STARTING THE PROGRAM:
---------------------
When you launch, you'll see:
  - AI provider connection status
  - Ready prompt

LOOKING UP VERSES:
------------------
Just type a Bible reference:

  > John 3:16
  > Romans 8:28
  > 1 John 4:8
  > Matthew 5:1-10

Output shows Greek and English side-by-side:
  --- John 3:16 ---
  Greek:   Οὕτως γὰρ ἠγάπησεν ὁ θεὸς τὸν κόσμον...
  English: For God so loved the world...

The program will ask if you want AI analysis of the verse.

ASKING QUESTIONS:
-----------------
Ask any question about the Greek text:

  > What does agape mean in 1 John 4:8?
  > Explain the grammar of John 1:1
  > What is the significance of logos in John 1:14?
  > Compare agape and phileo
  > Define Strong's G26

The AI searches for relevant Greek context and responds based ONLY on the
Greek text.

CONVERSATION MEMORY:
--------------------
The AI remembers your conversation, so you can ask follow-up questions:

  > What does John 1:1 say about Jesus?
  [AI responds with Greek analysis]
  > What's the significance of "was" in that verse?
  [AI remembers we're discussing John 1:1]

7. TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROGRAM WON'T START:
--------------------
Q: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'chromadb'"
A: Dependencies not installed. Run: python install.py

Q: "Cannot connect to Ollama"
A: Start Ollama in another terminal: ollama serve

Q: "GOOGLE_API_KEY not found"
A: Create .env file with: GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here

VERSE NOT FOUND:
----------------
Q: "Verse not found" error
A: Check spelling and format:

□ Morphological word-by-word interlinear display
□ Cross-reference system
□ Export to PDF/HTML

MID-TERM:
---------
□ Additional Christian texts:
  - Early Church Fathers (Greek and Latin)
  - Systematic theology works
  - Commentaries and study guides
□ Advanced search with syntax trees
□ Original language Hebrew (Old Testament)
□ Multiple Greek text versions (Byzantine, Textus Receptus)

LONG-TERM (Business Vision):
